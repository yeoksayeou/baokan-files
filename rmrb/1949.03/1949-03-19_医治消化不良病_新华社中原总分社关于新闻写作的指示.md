To address the common problem in current news and communication writing, where materials are not analyzed and organized, leading to a mere listing and isolated reporting of phenomena, the Xinhua News Agency Central Plains Branch recently pointed out the necessary tasks for writing good news reports. This is an extremely pertinent opinion for improving future news and communication. Editor's Note.
　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　

Recently, submissions from various regions, especially rural news reports, have shown a rather widespread formula: At the beginning, they sometimes list a large number of figures, such as how many districts and villages held peasant representative conferences, how many members there are, how many times they fought against bandits and despots, how many militiamen were developed, etc. Sometimes, they describe the process of various meetings in a tedious manner, with the entire page filled with "Sister Zhang said," "Old Man Li said," etc. Then comes the experience as follows: A, B, C, D. This makes it taste like chewing wax, and one cannot see the development of the movement. This form of expression is not only not news communication, but even as a work report, it is clumsy and must be improved. Chairman Mao's "Report on an Investigation of the Peasant Movement in Hunan," although without "experience as follows, A, B, C, D," is the most typical and exemplary summary of experience. To illustrate the issue, it is necessary to explain the required figures and the meeting process, and it is also necessary to summarize experiences that are truly universal and have guiding significance for practical work. However, these figures and meeting processes must be analyzed and organized as necessary; these experiences must be illustrated through facts. Although News ABC has repeatedly taught us to let the facts speak, we often forget this when we pick up a pen. A general office instruction said: "In news communication, not only must there be ideology and policy as the backbone, but there must also be actual social life and vivid typical examples as flesh and blood." Since ideology and policy are the backbone, and actual social life and vivid typical examples are the flesh and blood, then the backbone and flesh and blood should be closely integrated and permeate each other, rather than being separated. However, the above-mentioned news formula is obviously not integrated but separated. According to that formula, it is nothing more than a heap of numbers or a list of phenomena; that is, a few isolated so-called experience summaries. The reason for this formula is that our editors, reporters, and correspondents have committed two biases: One is that they have a lot of material in hand, but lack the necessary analysis, organization, and comparison, and use ideology and policy to select and discard these materials, so as to organize them organically. They record everything they hear and stuff the reader with material that even they themselves find a headache to read. The other is to dryly copy a few experiences from documents or from the reports of responsible comrades. These two biases are due to the fact that they have not digested what they have accepted with their own brains. They eat grass, but what they squeeze out is not milk, but still grass, suffering from indigestion. In order to cure this disease, it is necessary to:

One, when you have mastered a pile of materials, the first step is to classify and compare them, and think carefully about what issue you are going to explain in this news and how to explain it (the so-called layout), and then start writing. You cannot write good news without thinking.

Two, documents must be read, and the reports of responsible comrades must be listened to and recorded carefully. However, reading documents and listening to reports does not mean that the problem has been solved. This only gives a key to solving the problem back to you. The principles and principles in these documents and reports must be taken to the reality to protect, enrich, enrich, and sometimes even revise. The simple reproduction and copying of principles and principles are records, not reporters. These principles and principles must be explained and developed through actual social life and vivid typical examples.

Three, complex and very important manuscripts are often not accomplished by the strength of one person. We advocate collective writing, with everyone participating, and responsible comrades should personally take action when necessary. If each of our branch responsible comrades can personally write one or two good manuscripts every month, then whether from the point of view of completing the party's tasks or from the point of view of improving the writing level among comrades, it will have good results.

　　“医治消化不良病”
    ——新华社中原总分社关于新闻写作的指示
    新华社中原总分社，最近针对目前新闻通讯写作中由于对材料不加分析整理，使新闻通讯表现现象罗列与孤立报导的毛病，指出写好新闻通讯必须要做的工作，对今后新闻通讯的提高上是一个极其中肯的意见，特介绍如下：　编者
    　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　
    最近各地来稿，特别是农村消息报导中，有一个带有相当普遍性的公式；一开头有时罗列一大堆数目字，如有多少区村，召开了农代会，有多少会员，和土匪恶霸斗争了多少次，发展了多少民兵等；有时繁琐地描写各种会议进程，满纸张大嫂说，李大爷讲出……。接下去就是经验如下，甲、乙、丙、丁。使人读起来味同嚼蜡，看不出运动的发展。这种表现形式，不仅不算是什么新闻通讯，即把他当一个工作报告看，也是拙劣的，必须加以改进的工作报告。毛主席的湖南农民运动考察报告，虽然没有经验如下，甲乙丙丁，然而却是最典型地、最模范地总结了经验。为了说明问题，必要的数目字和会议进程，是需要交代的，真正带有普遍性并对实际工作有指导意义的经验，也是应该总结的。但是，这些数目字和会议进程，要有必要的分析和整理；这些经验，必须通过事实来说明。新闻学ＡＢＣ上虽一再教导我们让事实说话，而我们一提起笔，就往往把他忘记。总社有一个指示电中曾说：“在新闻通讯中，不但必须有思想、政策作骨干，而且必须有实际的社会生活，和生动的典型例子作血肉”。既然是以思想政策作骨干，既然是以实际的社会生活和生动的典型例子作血肉，那么骨干与血肉就应该密切结合、互相渗透，而不是彼此分离。但上述那种新闻公式，显然不是结合而是分离。依据那种公式，不是数目字的堆砌或现象的罗列；就是几条孤零零地所谓经验总结。产生这种公式的原因，在于我们的编辑、记者、通讯员、犯了两种偏向：一种是手里有一大堆材料，缺乏必要的分析、整理和比较，并且用思想政策把这些材料有所取舍，从而有机地组织起来。他们有闻必录地，把一份连他自己看了也会头痛的材料，塞给读者。另一种是从文件中，或者从负责同志的报告中，干燥的抄几条经验。这两种偏向，都是由于对他自己所接受的东西，没有经过自己的脑子加以消化。他们吃下去是青草，但挤出来并不是牛乳，而依然是青草，犯了消化不良病。为了医治这种病症，必须：
    一、当你掌握了一堆材料之后，第一步要分类比较，细细的想一想，待思想成熟，大体了解你这条新闻准备说明一个什么问题，怎样去说明（所谓布局），然后再动手。那种不加思考，下笔直书，是写不出好新闻的。
    二、文件是要阅读的，负责同志的报告是要好好地听好好地记的。但是读了文件，听了报告，不等于就解决了问题。这仅仅给了回去解决问题的一把钥匙，这些文件报告中的原理、原则，要拿到实际中去保护、充实、丰富、有时甚至是修正。原理、原则的单纯的翻印和抄制，那是记录，不是记者。这些原理、原则，要通过实际的社会生活和生动的典型例子加以说明，加以发挥。
    三、内容复杂而又十分重要的稿件，还往往不是一个人的力量所能完成的。我们提倡集体采写，大家动手，必要的时候负责同志要亲自下手。如果我们每个分社负责同志，每月都能亲自动手，写一两篇好的稿件，那么不论从完成党的任务说，不论从提高同志间的采写水平说，都会收到良好的效果。
