　　How Many Relatives Were Forced to Death?
  　Kill the Enemy and Avenge on the Battlefield
    New Liberated Soldiers of a Certain Replenishment Training Regiment Request to Join the People's Liberation Army
    [Our Newspaper News] Our certain unit's replenishment training regiment, after current affairs and class education, especially after speaking out about grievances and digging up the roots of poverty, has unprecedentedly raised its class consciousness, distinguished between the enemy and ourselves, and have successively requested to join the army to seek revenge. At the grievance-airing and spirit-sacrificing conference of the Third Battalion, in the spirit shed were placed the memorial tablets of twenty-five elders, brothers, and sisters who were forced to hang themselves, were killed, or died of cold and starvation. On the couplets on both sides were solemnly written "Tell your grievances to the Communist Party" and "Tell your injustices to the People's Liberation Army." At the meeting, everyone scrambled to speak out about their suffering and report their tragic experiences. Comrade Guo Shousheng said sadly: "My family is very poor, and I have not been able to eat enough since I was a child... My elder brother was tied up to Beijing and shot by the traitor because he was a soldier of the Eighth Route Army. Later, the traitor tied my father away and stabbed him forty times..." At this point, he was already crying unrecognizably, and other comrades were also sadly shedding tears. Finally, he said with resentment: "Now I am aware that if I don't defeat the reactionaries for one day, I will not be able to turn over for one day. I am determined to join the army and fight the bad guys desperately, avenge my father, and swear not to go home if I don't defeat the reactionaries!" Comrade Gao Youcai stepped onto the stage and said with grief and indignation: "When I think of the person who killed my father, I can't wait to bite him twice. I want to join the army to take revenge..." The comrades of the First and Second Companies even more excitedly stood up and shouted: "Swear to avenge the poor friends!" All swore: "Guarantee to join the army and serve the people to the end, and swear not to return home until the complete liberation of China!" At the spirit-sacrificing meeting of the Second Battalion, Comrade Liu Chengyuan angrily pointed to the memorial tablets of forty-two dead elders and said, "Do we think these forty-two lives are the benefits that the four major families of the Chiang Kai-shek gang gave us!? Now we are aware, we can no longer endure it, I want to apply to the higher authorities to allow me to join the army, I also propose that we join the army together to take revenge!" After speaking out about grievances, the comrades of the First Battalion collectively swore: "Among our six hundred and forty-five comrades, three hundred and seventy-one have been oppressed and exploited, the parents of forty-eight people were forced to hang themselves or died of cold and starvation, twenty-six families were broken and destroyed and had no home to return to, five hundred and sixteen people were caught to be soldiers and fight their own people, just like Comrade Wang Yuqing: because they could not pay the rent, the landlord seized their houses and land, forced their parents to death, sold their dear younger sister, and were driven out to be cannon fodder for the Chiang bandits. Our grievances are as deep as the sea, we apply to the higher authorities to allow us to join the army to take revenge!

  　杀敌报仇上战场
    某补训团新解放战士要求参加解放军
    【本报讯】我某部补训团，经过时事及阶级教育，特别是经过诉苦挖穷苦根后，阶级觉悟空前提高，分清了敌我界线，纷纷要求参军报仇。三营在诉苦祭灵大会上，灵棚中摆着二十五个被迫吊死、杀死或冻饿而死的父老兄弟姐妹的灵位，两侧对联上庄严的写着“有苦诉给共产党”，“有冤说给解放军”。会上大家争相诉苦，报告自己的苦难事迹，郭寿升同志沉痛的说：“我家里很穷，我从小就吃不上饭……我哥哥因当八路军被汉奸绑到北京枪毙了，后来汉奸又把我父亲绑走穿了四十刺刀……”说到此他已哭得不象样，其他同志也都难过的流下眼泪，最后他愤恨地说：“现在我觉悟了，一天不打垮反动派，我就一天不能翻身，我决心参军去和坏家伙们拚命，为父报仇，打不垮反动派誓不回家！”高有才同志上台悲愤地说：“想起害死我父亲的人我恨不得咬他两口，我要参军报仇……”一、二连的同志们更激动的站起来高喊：“誓为穷朋友报仇！”全体宣誓：“保证参军为人民服务到底，不彻底解放全中国誓不回乡！”二营在祭灵会上刘成元同志愤怒地指着四十二个死难父老的灵位说：“我们想想这四十二条人命，就是四大家族蒋介石匪帮给我们的好处！？现在我们觉悟了，我们不能再忍下去，我要申请上级允许我参军，我还提议我们一齐参军报仇！”一营同志于诉苦后，全体宣誓：“我们六百四十五名同志中，三百七十一人受过压迫剥削，四十八人的爹娘被逼吊死或冻饿而死，廿六人家破人亡无家可归，五百一十六人被抓出来当兵打自己人，象王玉庆同志一样：因交不起租子被地主夺去房屋土地，逼死父母，卖了亲妹妹，自己又被赶出来为蒋匪当炮灰。我们的冤仇深似海，我们申请上级准许我们参军报仇！
