　　Ping City Districts Use Key Demonstration Methods
    Gradually Establish New Political Power
    [This Newspaper News] The puppet Baojia system and its institutions in Beiping Municipality are being gradually abolished, and people's political power institutions have begun to be established gradually. The establishment of people's political power in urban areas is being promoted through key demonstrations. Each district independently selects street areas with a better work foundation as key points to lead the masses to actively carry out the work. Xisanqi Village in the 19th District, Second Street, Liulitun, Pingfang, and Zhao Village in the 13th District, and the Third Bao in the 5th District have all formally formed the people's village and street political power in the middle of this month. Taking the 5th District (North City) as an example, the work team began to investigate and relieve poor households when exchanging puppet gold yuan coupons after liberation. They also went deep into the masses in cleaning and sanitation and tax collection work, held worker symposiums and intellectual symposiums, and established worker study groups (planned to be expanded into worker night schools). Through these tasks, they discovered and cultivated many activists who played a core role among the masses, gradually raising the masses' political awareness. Taking the Third Bao as a demonstration street, they mobilized various Jia to hold mass forums and activist meetings to expose the crimes of the old Baojia. When the announcement was made to abolish the old Baojia and establish people's street political power, the masses in the Bao were extremely enthusiastic, and some even found the district government to urge and demand immediate action. Thus, they formally established the people's street government on the 18th. The process of establishing new political power in each street and village generally involves the masses' accusation of puppet Baojia personnel (this is a universal demand from the masses), and then the work team helps the masses conduct anonymous voting elections to elect administrative personnel supported by the people themselves to form new administrative bodies. At the same time, the work team formally announced the abolition of the puppet Baojia system and the establishment of people's political power. The new political power personnel are mostly workers and peasants who have connections with the masses, some of whom are female workers. In order to celebrate the birth of their own political power, many villages and streets organized stilts and lion dances to add to the fun.

　　平市各区用重点示范办法
    逐步建立新政权
    【本报讯】北平市之伪保甲制度及其机构正逐步被废除，人民政权机构已开始逐步建立。城区人民建政，是以重点示范来推进。由各区自行选择工作基础较好之街区作重点，领导群众积极进行。十九区的西三旗村、第二街、十三区的六里屯、平房、赵家村、五区的第三保等地，均已先后在本月中旬正式组成人民的村街政权。具体的做法，以五区（北城）为例，工作组在解放后兑换伪金元券时，即开始调查救济贫户，又在清洁卫生及征收等工作中深入群众，召开工人座谈会、知识分子座谈会，建立工人学习小组（近拟扩大为工人夜校），经过这些工作，又发现与培养了不少积极分子，在群众中起了核心作用，使群众政治觉悟逐渐提高。即以三保为示范街，发动各甲举行群众座谈会、积极分子会，揭发旧保甲罪恶。当宣布准备废除旧保甲、建立人民街政权时，该保群众情绪极高，有的便找到区政府催促，要求立即进行。这样，他们便在十八号正式成立了人民的街政府。各街村成立新政权的过程，一般是先经过群众对伪保甲人员的控诉（这是群众普遍要求），然后由工作组帮助群众进行无记名投票的选举，选出人民自己拥护的行政人员，组成新的行政机构。同时由工作组正式宣布废除伪保甲制度，成立人民政权。新的政权人员，大都是与群众有联系的工农劳动者，其中有些是女工。人民为了庆祝自己政权的诞生，不少村街组织了高跷、狮子会助兴。
