　　Lessons of the Indonesian Incident
　　Sha Ping
　　The Indonesian national independence movement led by the bourgeoisie has completely failed, and the Indonesian people's anti-imperialist national liberation struggle will enter a new stage.

    The Republic of Indonesia government, which existed for three years and four months, unexpectedly and rapidly disintegrated in the face of the new full-scale offensive launched by the Netherlands on December 19 last year. The Indonesian people's national liberation struggle has since entered a new stage. In the short period of less than three months from the start of the new Dutch offensive to the present, the Indonesian people's guerrilla warfare is developing extensively, leaving the 130,000 Dutch invading troops trapped in isolated cities and struggling to cope. As long as it can obtain correct leadership in the future, the future of the Indonesian national liberation struggle is entirely bright. At this time, reviewing the experience of the Indonesian national liberation struggle over the past three years and more is beneficial to the Indonesian people and all the oppressed people of Asia.

    The full-scale Dutch offensive at the end of last year was the second in two years. The first full-scale offensive began on July 21, 1947. At that time, with the help and support of American imperialism, the Netherlands tore up the Linggadjati Agreement signed in March 1947 and launched a large-scale war of aggression in Java and Sumatra, occupying large tracts of Indonesian land. Afterwards, the United Nations Security Council nominally came forward to mediate, but in reality, it was American imperialism that intervened. As a result, the Indonesian side was forced to sign the humiliating Renville Agreement with the Netherlands on the American warship Renville on January 17, 1948. In the eleven months after the signing of the Renville Agreement, the Dutch imperialists not only did not stop their local military operations and comprehensive economic blockade against Indonesia, but also actively carried out large-scale military offensive deployments under the smoke screen of American "mediation." By December 1948, the Indonesian reactionary government had suppressed the people's resistance and arrested and massacred a large number of progressive elements. At that time, the Dutch military offensive had already been launched, and the imperialists had no more scruples, so they simply announced the abolition of the Renville Agreement and launched a new large-scale blitzkrieg against the Republic of Indonesia, attempting to reduce the Republic of Indonesia to a completely colonial status.

    Within a few days of the start of the second full-scale Dutch offensive, the Dutch troops occupied all the important cities and ports of Java and Sumatra with almost no organized resistance. At the beginning of the offensive, Dutch paratroopers landed in the Indonesian capital of Yogyakarta, and Republic President Sukarno, Prime Minister Hatta, Foreign Minister Salim, former Prime Minister Sjahrir, Army Commander-in-Chief Sudirman, and all the civil and military officials were taken prisoner. The government structure was completely shattered. The Republic of Indonesia, which emerged after the surrender of Japan, survived for three years and four months, and collapsed completely.

    The collapse of the Republic of Indonesia led by Sukarno and Hatta does not, of course, mean the complete failure of the Indonesian national independence movement, nor can it be regarded as the Indonesian people's kneeling before imperialism. It only means that the Indonesian national independence movement led by the bourgeoisie has declared complete bankruptcy, and the Indonesian people's anti-imperialist national liberation struggle will enter a new stage. In this new stage, the deceptive influence of imperialism and the bourgeoisie on the Indonesian people will be reduced, and the possibility of the Indonesian people launching a widespread anti-imperialist revolutionary struggle under the leadership of the proletariat will increase.

    In Indonesia, as in all colonies and semi-colonies, there are two different lines of leadership in the national liberation movement: one is led by the bourgeoisie, which does not believe in the people, does not rely on the people, fears imperialism, and is prepared to surrender at any time; the other is led by the proletariat, which believes in the people, relies on the people, despises imperialism, and fights imperialism to the end.

    The history of the past Indonesian national struggle proves that the Indonesian nation, which has been subjected to 350 years of foreign enslavement and oppression, has a strong will to resist imperialist aggression and enslavement. Once the 70 million oppressed people are united, they will become an indestructible and powerful force. Unfortunately, although the Indonesian people took advantage of the victory of World War II and declared national independence on August 17, 1945, the ruling power of the Republic of Indonesia fell into the hands of the Indonesian bourgeoisie. Although the Indonesian proletariat, the Indonesian Communist Party, and other revolutionaries had waged many struggles (mainly after the second half of 1948) to change the leadership of the Republic of Indonesia and establish their own independent leadership, on the whole, until the new Dutch offensive, the Indonesian proletariat had not been able to achieve its goals. The Indonesian bourgeoisie finally gradually moved towards the road of surrender, and the Republic completely collapsed.

    If the Republican government had cooperated with the people from the beginning and immediately organized the people to resist imperialist aggression, the Indonesian national liberation movement should have laid a solid foundation. But this group of new nobles who made up the leadership of the Republic of Indonesia, including feudal aristocrats, former bureaucrats under Dutch rule, comprador bourgeoisie, white-collar classes unique to the colony, and even a group of guys who had served as fascist henchmen during the Japanese occupation, once they held power, abandoned the people, despised and hated the people, and finally betrayed the people. They used the old methods used by the Dutch imperialists and Japanese fascists to enslave, oppress, and exploit their compatriots. Corruption was rampant, and bribery was rampant. The peasants, who accounted for more than 80 percent of the population, could not get rid of the heavy burdens of taxes and corvee under the Republican government, could not reduce land rent and usury exploitation, and because of inflation and reduced production, their lives were more painful than during the Dutch and Japanese rule. The Republican army, except for a few, were all hired and detached from the people. With the emergence of the Republic, a large number of new bureaucrats and new warlords emerged, who used feudal exploitation of the masses of the people to accumulate huge bureaucratic capital, which was deposited in the United States, India, and Singapore, and squandered to their heart's content, while neglecting the national defense and production construction urgently needed by the people.

　　印尼事变的教训
    沙平
    由资产阶级领导的印尼民族独立运动已全部破产，而印尼人民的反帝民族解放斗争将要进入新的阶段。
    存在了三年四个月的印尼共和国政府，在荷兰于去年十二月十九日所发动的新的全面进攻面前，意外迅速的解体了。印尼人民的民族解放斗争，从此进入了新的阶段。从荷兰开始新进攻到现在的短短的不到三个月当中，印尼的人民游击战争正在广泛的发展着，已使得荷兰的十三万侵略军困守孤城，穷于应付。只要今后能获得正确的领导，印尼民族解放斗争的前途，是完全光明的。在这个时候，回顾一下三年多以来的印尼民族解放斗争的经验，对于印尼人民和全亚洲的被压迫人民，都是有益的。
    去年年底的荷兰的全面进攻，是两年来的第二次。第一次的全面进攻是从一九四七年七月二十一日开始的。当时，荷兰在美国帝国主义的帮助和支持下，撕毁了于一九四七年三月所签订的林牙椰蒂协定，在爪哇和苏门答腊进行了大规模的侵略战争，占领了印尼的大块土地。之后，在名义上由联合国安全理事会出面调停，而实际上，则是由美帝国主义进行干涉，结果，印尼方面被迫于一九四八年一月十七日与荷兰在美舰伦维尔号上签订了屈辱协定。在这个伦维尔协定签字以后的十一个月中，荷兰帝国主义对印尼的局部军事行动和全面经济封锁不但没有停止过，而且在美国“调处”的烟幕下，积极进行了大规模军事进攻的部署。到一九四八年十二月，印尼反动政府镇压了人民的反抗，大批逮捕和屠杀了进步分子。那时，荷兰的军事进攻已经发动，帝国主义就再没有什么顾虑，索性公开宣布伦维尔协定作废，向印尼共和国进行了新的大规模闪击战，企图借此沦印尼共和国于完全殖民地的地位。
    在荷兰第二次全面进攻开始的数天内，荷兰军队几乎没有遭遇到什么有组织的抵抗，就占领了爪哇和苏门答腊的一切重要城市和港口。在进攻的开头，荷兰伞兵就在印尼首都日惹降落，共和国总统苏加诺、总理哈达、外长沙立姆、前总理沙利尔、陆军总司令苏军曼以及满朝文武官员，都做了俘虏。政府机构完全粉碎。日本投降以后产生的印度尼西亚共和国，生存了三年零四个月，至此遂整个地垮台了。
    苏加诺、哈达领导的印尼共和国的垮台，当然不等于印尼民族独立运动的全盘失败，更不能认为是印尼人民在帝国主义面前的屈膝。这只是意味着：由资产阶级领导的印尼民族独立运动已宣告全部破产，而印尼人民的反帝民族解放斗争将要进入新的阶段。在这个新的阶段中，帝国主义和资产阶级对于印尼人民的欺骗影响将要缩小，而印尼人民在无产阶级领导下广泛地展开反帝国主义的革命斗争的可能性，则将要增加。
    在印尼，如同在旁的一切殖民地、半殖民地一样，在民族解放运动中，存在着两条不同的领导路线：一条是资产阶级领导的，不相信人民、不依靠人民、害怕帝国主义、准备随时屈服的投降路线；另一条是无产阶级领导的，相信人民、依靠人民、蔑视帝国主义、与帝国主义斗争到底的革命路线。
    过去的印尼民族斗争的历史证明，经过三百五十年异族的奴役压迫的印度尼西亚民族，具有反抗帝国主义侵略和奴役的坚强意志。七千万被压迫人民一旦团结起来，会变成不可摧毁的强大力量。不幸的是，印尼人民虽乘第二次世界大战胜利结束的时机，于一九四五年八月十七日宣布了民族独立，但印尼共和国的统治权力，却落入印尼资产阶级之手。印尼的无产阶级，印尼的共产党和其他革命分子，虽曾进行过许多斗争（主要地是在一九四八年下半年以后），来改变印尼共和国的领导，并建立自己的独立领导，但是整个地说来，直到荷兰的这次新进攻为止，印尼无产阶级并没有能够达到自己的目的。印尼资产阶级终于逐步地走到投降的道路上，共和国完全垮台。
    若共和国政府开始就和人民合作立即组织起人民来进行反抗帝国主义的侵略，印尼民族解放运动，应当已经奠定了巩固的基础。但是这一群组成印尼共和国领导成份的新贵们，其中包含有封建贵族、旧日荷兰统治下的官僚、买办资产阶级、殖民地特有的白领带阶级，以至于在日本占领时期曾充当法西斯爪牙的一批家伙，他们一朝权在手，就抛弃人民，轻视和仇视人民，终于叛卖了人民。他们使用荷兰帝国主义和日本法西斯用过的一套老办法，来奴役、压迫、榨取自己的同胞。腐化入骨，贿赂公行。占人口百分之八十以上的农民，在共和国政府下，不能解除沉重的捐税与劳役负担，不能减轻地租与高利贷剥削，而且由于通货膨胀，生产缩减，他们的生活比在荷兰与日本统治时期，更来得痛苦，共和国军队除少数外，都是雇佣的，脱离人民的。随着共和国的出现，产生了大批新官僚、新军阀，他们使用对人民大众的封建剥削，积累巨大的官僚资本，存放在美国、印度和新加坡，并且尽情挥霍，而对于人民迫切所需要的国防及生产建设，则置诸不顾。
