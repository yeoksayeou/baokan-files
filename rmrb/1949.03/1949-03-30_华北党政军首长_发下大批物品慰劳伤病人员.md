　　Leading Party, Government and Military Officials of North China
    Issue Large Quantities of Goods to Comfort Wounded and Sick Personnel
    [Our Newspaper] To enable convalescing personnel who are gloriously wounded and have contracted illnesses from overwork to recover their health as soon as possible, the North China People's Government, the North China Bureau of the CPC Central Committee, and the North China Military Region of the People's Liberation Army distributed a large number of comfort goods to the North China International Peace Hospital on March 21st, including 514 catties of pork, 2,576 boxes of cigarettes, and 514 towels. The hospital, together with the convalescent committee, distributed the comfort goods to each convalescent the next day. Each person received one towel, five large boxes of cigarettes, and one catty of meat (collective improvement of meals). The convalescents were very happy to receive the comfort goods and proposed writing letters to the leaders to ensure compliance with hospital rules and strive to be discharged from the hospital as soon as possible to answer the leaders' love and hope.
