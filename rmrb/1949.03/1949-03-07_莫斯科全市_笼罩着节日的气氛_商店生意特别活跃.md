　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 5th. TASS, Moscow, 1st: In accordance with the decision of the government and the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, state-owned stores throughout the Soviet Union are implementing new price reductions starting today. The entire city of Moscow is shrouded in a festive atmosphere. On the streets, on trams and subways, and in shops, people are happily discussing the benefits of the price reductions. March 1st is the day when many factories and institutions in Moscow pay their salaries. Business is particularly brisk in Moscow's major department stores. The "Central Department Store" sold 1,144,000 rubles worth of goods in the first three hours of opening. Although the price of goods has been reduced by 10 to 30 percent, the store's total sales today exceeded the average daily sales by approximately 500,000 rubles. It is particularly noteworthy that people have increased their purchases of radios, watches, pianos, bicycles, and clothing. There are many styles of clothing in the shops for customers to choose from. The arrival of spring is reflected in the demand for certain goods, with many people needing light clothing such as spring coats and raincoats. Women bought many silk clothes, the prices of which have been reduced by 15 percent, and there are also many customers in jewelry stores. The price reductions in state-owned retail commerce have immediately affected the collective farm market in Moscow, where the price of milk and potatoes has been reduced by about 25 percent, and the price of meat, butter, eggs, and other products is also much cheaper.
