Tianjin Workers Find Their Own Way
　Allocation, Storage, and Distribution of Grain

　　[Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, 14th] Tianjin workers have discussed and resolved the problem of storing and distributing 120 million catties of grain allocated by the democratic government. This batch of grain was specially transported from the Northeast Liberated Area by the Tianjin Trading Company to ensure that workers' lives are not affected by price fluctuations. If half of all workers' salaries are paid in corn, this corn can be used to pay the enterprises and factories for three months. However, this grain was exposed to snow and moisture during transportation to Tianjin and must be dried before storage. Therefore, how to store this huge amount of damp corn has become a major issue. To this end, the Tianjin Office of the Preparatory Committee of the North China Federation of Trade Unions specially convened a meeting on the 6th of this month with more than 200 representatives of workers from enterprises, factories, and some major private factories in Tianjin to discuss the matter. Mayor Huang Jing and Li Jiebo, Director of the Tianjin Office of the Preparatory Committee of the North China Federation of Trade Unions, personally participated. After explaining the significance of this discounted grain distribution, the representatives immediately divided into groups according to their respective units to carefully discuss and put forward many valuable opinions on transportation, storage, drying, grinding, and deduction of wages. After summarizing the opinions, based on the principle of "helping the government solve the problem of grain storage on the one hand, and taking care of the interests of workers on the other," it was decided to organize a grain management committee to store the grain using three methods: centralized storage, partial storage, or complete distribution to the homes of all workers. Transportation tools, sacks, etc., should be solved by the factories themselves or adjusted mutually as much as possible. After the method was determined, Mayor Huang expressed his great pleasure at everyone's active efforts to solve the grain problem at the end of the meeting. He said: If everyone thinks of a solution and concentrates their will, any difficult problem can be solved. This method should be used more often to solve problems in the future.

　　天津职工自己想办法
  　分配保管配售粮
    【新华社天津十四日电】天津市职工自己商量办法，解决了民主政府配售的一亿二千万斤粮食的保管与分配问题。这批粮食是天津贸易公司为保障职工生活不受物价波动影响，特自东北解放区运来的。如果所有职工薪资一半以玉米发放，则此项玉米可供各企业工厂发放三个月之用。但此项粮食在运津途中遇雪受潮，必须晒干以后方能存储。因此如何保管此项庞大数量的受潮玉米，成为当前重大问题。为此华北总工会筹委会天津办事处特于本月六日召集天津市各企业工厂及部分主要私营工厂职工代表二百余人开会商谈。黄敬市长及华北总工会筹委会天津办事处李颉伯主任等均亲自参加。在说明此次平售配粮的意义后各代表随即依照所属单位分成小组仔细讨论，对运输、保管、晒干、磨粉、扣除工资折价等问题，提出许多宝贵的意见。经分别综合后，即本着“一方面帮助政府解决粮食保管问题，一方面照顾职工利益”的原则，确定组织粮食管理委员会，用集中保管、部分保管或全部分散到各职工家中三种方法保管。运输工具、麻袋等尽量由各厂自己解决或互相调剂。确定办法后，结束会议时黄市长对于大家积极想办法解决粮食问题表示十分高兴。他说：大家想办法，意志集中起来，什么困难问题都解决得了。以后应多采用这种办法解决问题。
