[Jinan Electric] After the spring rain in southern Hebei, farmers have begun spring ploughing, fertilization, harrowing and other activities. After the Hebei Southern Administrative Office issued instructions on spring ploughing, the special commissioner offices and county-level leading organs have made specific arrangements according to the different characteristics of various regions. The instructions from all localities commonly emphasized the importance of delivering manure and crushing manure early, as well as plowing and harrowing the land as early as possible. The plan of the Third Special Commissioner's Office requires the completion of spring ploughing before the Qingming Festival. At the same time, it pointed out that in addition to helping the masses overcome all difficulties to complete spring ploughing and sowing in disaster areas, it is also necessary to pay attention to combining the organization of sideline production to help the masses overcome famine. Currently, spring ploughing mobilization has been deployed to the villages in various regions, and significant achievements have been made in many areas. First of all, all localities have paid close attention to solving the problem of hemp seed, thus ensuring the smooth progress of the work. The Yongnian County Government bought more than 900 jin of hemp seeds. The Jize County Promotion Society bought 1,100 jin. Other counties have also purchased sufficient seeds, and are now starting to sow. Personnel of the Third Special Commissioner's Office planted hemp along both sides of the highway in sections, with each person planting at least twenty-five trees. Among the 120 villages in Qinghe, 25,701 trees have already been planted. In terms of accumulating and delivering manure: According to statistics from Xiajin from January 20th to February 20th, 210 heads of ploughing cattle were added in the third district, and 443,380 jin of bean cake and oil cake were purchased. In Qinghe's second, third, and fifth districts, since the seventh day of the first lunar month, 5,727 carts of manure have been delivered. Harrowing has also been widely carried out in various places. Five villages in the second district of Shenxian County harrowed 3,555 mu of land. In the third district of Zhentang County, a total of 7,603 mu of spring land were ploughed, and 3,500 mu have been harrowed. The first, second, and fourth districts have harrowed 60% of all spring land. Incomplete statistics from the second, third, and fifth districts of Qinghe show that a total of 71,195 mu of land have been harrowed. At present, the following shortcomings exist in the leadership of various regions, which need to be overcome urgently: 1. Due to the impact of certain temporary tasks, some counties and districts have relaxed their leadership over spring ploughing, resulting in extremely uneven progress in spring ploughing. In the future, we should seize the time to improve organizational structure. More importantly, we must appropriately combine production with other tasks and correct the one-sided working method. 2. In some individual places, due to the lack of in-depth spring ploughing mobilization, some farmers still do not fully understand the policies of developing production, and still have ideological concerns such as fear of "equal distribution" and fear of bearing more burdens. In the future, we should continue to strengthen policy propaganda and education. 3. The production work in some places still remains at the stage of "only cadres holding meetings and making arrangements, without specific leadership." Therefore, it is necessary to conduct in-depth inspections and specifically solve the ideological problems of cadres and the masses. We cannot be satisfied with some superficial achievements, or think that the task is completed once it is assigned. Cadres should be educated to deeply understand that leading production is an extremely meticulous and concrete organizational work. If we want to complete the task well, ideological mobilization, timely arrangements, and frequent inspections are all links that the leadership must master.

### 冀南春耕动员开始深入到村  农民争先耙地送粪　地边堰头普栽大麻

　　冀南春耕动员开始深入到村
    农民争先耙地送粪
  　地边堰头普栽大麻
    【冀南电】冀南各县喜逢春雨，广大农民开始春耕、施肥、耙地等活动。自行署春耕工作指示发出后，各专署与县级领导机关已根据各地不同特点，先后做出具体布置。各地指示中共同的都强调了提前送粪、捣粪与及早将土地犁好、耙好。三专署计划中要求在清明节前，完成春耕，同时指出灾区除注意帮助群众克服一切困难完成春耕下种外，并须注意结合组织副业生产，帮助群众渡荒。目前各地春耕动员，均已布置到村，在不少地区，均变得显著成绩。首先是各地注意抓紧解决了大麻子种籽问题，因此保证了工作的顺利进行。永年县府买大麻籽九百余斤。鸡泽县推进社买了一千一百斤。其他各县也均购到充分的种籽，现均开始下种。三专署机关人员在公路两边分段点种，每人至少种二十五棵。清河一百二十余村中，已种二万五千七百零一棵。在积肥送粪方面：夏津从一月二十日到二月二十日的统计，三区添耕畜二百一十头，买豆饼、油饼、四十四万三千三百八十斤。清河二、三、五区自旧历正月初七日开始，已送粪五千七百二十七车。各地耙地亦均普遍展开，莘县二区五个村耙地三千五百五十五亩。振堂县三区共春地七千六百零三亩，已耙三千五百亩。一、二、四区已耙了全部春地的百分之六十。清河二、三、五区不完全统计，共耙地七万一千一百九十五亩。目前各地在领导方面存在着以下缺点，急待克服：一、由于某些临时任务的影响，有些县区放松了对春耕的领导，致春耕进行极不平衡。今后应抓紧及时健全组织机构，更重要的是把生产和其他任务适当的结合起来，纠正单打一的工作方法。二、有个别地方，由于春耕动员不深入，因而有些农民对发展生产的政策还不大了解，仍有怕“平分”、怕多负担等思想顾虑。今后仍应继续加强政策宣传和教育。三、有些地方的生产工作，仍停留在“只有干部开会布置，没有具体的领导”的阶段上。因此必须进行深入检查，具体的解决干部和群众的思想问题。不能满足于一些表面的成绩，或者以为布置下去就算完成任务。应教育干部深刻认识，领导生产是一件极细致的极具体的组织工作，要想把任务完成得好，思想动员、及时布置、勤作检查都是领导上必须掌握的环节。
