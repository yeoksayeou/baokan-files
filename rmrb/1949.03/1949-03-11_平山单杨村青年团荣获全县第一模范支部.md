[Chahar News] The Dan Yang Village Youth League branch in the fifth district of Ping Shan was awarded the title of First Model Youth League Branch at the county-wide Youth League Representative Conference held in late February. The County Youth League Committee specially awarded a large red flag with the words "Pioneer of League Branch Work," which aroused the envy and attention of all the representatives present. The Dan Yang Village League was established during the land reform movement the year before last. After gradual expansion over the past year, it now has fourteen members, who have played a significant role in work and study. The League took the initiative to contact the primary school teachers and organized a study group for League members last autumn. It mobilized more than thirty young people to organize a winter school. From beginning to end, everyone's enthusiasm for learning was very high; for example, during the Lunar New Year, classes were only suspended for one day. According to tests, eight people learned more than two hundred characters each. All can keep accounts, write notices, and write letters. Two people can read the New Masses Daily. The villagers all reflected, "This year's winter school is really useful!" Last autumn, the League members took the initiative to unite young people to organize three work exchange groups (twelve people) to haul manure and cultivate the land, plant autumn wheat on time, and make more than ten stacks of adobe bricks, solving the difficulty of insufficient labor and livestock. The parents happily said, "If it weren't for organizing the youth work exchange group, we wouldn't have been able to plant the wheat." Right after the New Year, they organized two work exchange groups (ten people) to start hauling manure and cultivating the land. In order to carry out the tree planting campaign, each League member guaranteed to plant four trees and led and mobilized young people and children outside the League to plant and keep alive at least one tree each. On the Gregorian New Year's Day, the League members took the initiative to unite with the village cadres to invite military and cadre families to hold a get-together, boiling water and buying melon seeds, and the meeting was very lively. During the Lunar New Year, the League took the lead and gathered children to pay New Year's greetings to military and cadre families. After the liberation of Tianjin and Beijing, each League member automatically wrote a letter of condolence to the soldiers at the front; those who could not write found someone to write for them. In short, the League can truly become a powerful assistant to the Party and government in every central task, such as when collecting public grain, the League members mobilized their families to pay first, and also assisted the village cadres in urging others. Secondly, in the expansion of the army, the conclusion of land reform, and the mobilization of children to enroll in school, they have achieved results. They can also promptly assist the teachers in writing good and bad deeds and major victory news on the blackboard newspaper and broadcasting it. The relationship between the Party and the League and the relationship between the League and the masses are not only close but also normal. The village cadres have repeatedly requested to commend the achievements of the Youth League.

　　平山单杨村青年团荣获全县第一模范支部
    【察哈尔讯】平山五区单杨村团支部，在二月下旬召开的全县青年团代表大会上，荣获第一模范团支部。县团委会特奖了大红旗一面，上写：“团支工作先锋”，引起到会全体代表的羡慕和注视。单杨村的团是在前年土地改革运动中创建起来的，经过去年一年的逐渐扩大，现在团员十四名，他们在工作学习上，起了很大作用。该团主动与小学教员联系，去秋组织了团员学习小组，动员了卅多青少年组织了冬学，自始至终大家的学习情绪很高，如过旧历年节时，只停了一天课。据测验每人学会在二百字以上者八人。都能记帐、写通知、写信。有两人能看新大众报。老乡们都反映：“今年的冬学可是顶事了！”去秋团员主动团结了青少年组织了三个拨工组（十二人）推粪耕地，按时种了秋麦，并打坯十余垛，解决了劳畜不足的困难，家长们高兴的说：“不是组织青年拨工组，麦子可是种不上。”年节刚过，他们就组织了两个拨工组（十人）开始送粪耕地。为开展植树运动，每个团员保证栽四棵树并带领动员团外青少年儿童每人至少栽活一棵。在阳历年，团员主动与村干部联合请了军、干属开联欢会，烧开水，买瓜子，会开得很热闹。旧历年时，以团为骨干，并集合了儿童给军、干属拜年。平津解放，每个团员自动的给前方战士写了一封慰问信，不会写的，找人代写。总之团在每个中心工作中，真正能成为党政工作的有力助手，如在征公粮时，团员动员家中先交，还协助村干部督促别人。其次在扩军中，结束土地改革及动员儿童入学均有成绩。并能及时协助教员将村子的好坏事例、大胜利消息写上黑板报和广播出去。党团关系和团群关系，不仅密切，而且正常。村干部曾数次要求表扬青年团功绩。
