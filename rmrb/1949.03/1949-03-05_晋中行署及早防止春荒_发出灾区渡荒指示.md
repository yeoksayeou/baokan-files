[Jinzhong Electric] The Jinzhong Administrative Office issued relevant instructions on the 12th of this month regarding the issue of surviving the famine in disaster areas. The disasters in Jinzhong are entirely the result of colonial exploitation by the Japanese invaders and the "integration of soldiers and farmers" by the Chiang Kai-shek bandits, which caused repeated and severe damage to the people's means of production and production materials. In the half year after liberation, through the efforts of our party, government, army, and people, most areas have gradually recovered, but current statistics still show that more than 164,000 people are unable to survive the spring famine. According to estimates from the First Administrative Region in December last year, the number of disaster victims without food or clothing accounts for nearly one-third of the population in the disaster areas. If strong leadership is provided to support production, two-thirds of the disaster victims can support themselves, while the remaining one-third are elderly, weak, disabled, and unable to produce and support themselves. The instructions pointed out that the general policy for disaster area work at present is mainly to mobilize the masses to use their own strength to carry out production and thrift, and to help themselves survive the famine. In terms of specific measures to survive the famine, the instructions put forward the following methods: First, care should be taken in the burden on disaster areas, and the public grain from last year should be reduced or exempted as appropriate, and adjustments should be made without affecting the amount of public grain to be paid. War support should be reduced or exempted in villages with severe disasters. In terms of loans, disaster areas should be given more consideration. The 3,000 shi of seed loans and 7,000 shi of production loans this spring should be mainly used to support production. In addition, the Civil Affairs Department of the Administrative Office will also issue 1,000 shi of relief grain. Cooperative mutual assistance methods can be used to first distribute to disaster victims who are elderly, weak, disabled, and unable to produce, and then organize them to cooperate in production with those who are able to work. Second, attention should be paid to organizing the masses to seize the time to plant early-maturing and high-yield crops. Without delaying the farming season, various sideline, handicraft, and mining productions should be organized. Efforts should be made to organize women to participate in production. In Pingding, during the victory over the disaster last year, nearly 100,000 women participated in autumn harvesting, plowing, pulling plows, making shoes, and carrying transportation, which solved a big problem. The instructions emphasized that, according to the experience of various places, as long as production is organized, there will be ways to provide disaster relief: In the three disaster areas of Dafangshan and Xiguoqiu in Meng County and Hanyan in Xin County in the First Administrative Region, in mid-January last year, they organized production such as opening shops, small vendors, tofu workshops, flour workshops, and weaving mats, which solved the living problems of one-third of the 1,900 people in the three villages; in Beitian Village, a disaster area village in the Second District of Yuci, the existing 25 households and more than 70 people opened tofu workshops, carried hawkers, organized the digging of medicinal materials, beating wild jujubes, embroidery, making shoes, etc. in December last year, earning more than 6,000 jin of millet, which can maintain the lives of the entire village for one month; in Pingding, during the victory over the disaster last year, there were 260 raw and cooked iron furnaces, which developed from 260 in December the year before last to 439 last year, with a total income of more than 60,000 large shi of millet. The number of iron ore kilns increased from 77 to 446, with an income of more than 9,000 large shi of millet. The paper mill earned more than 10,000 shi of millet. Thirdly, to promote thrift and save food, the existing food should be reserved for the most difficult times, and as much black dates and chaff should be mixed into the food as possible. In spring, the masses should be extensively mobilized to collect tree leaves and other substitutes for food. Finally, the instructions specifically called for strengthening the leadership of famine relief in various places. According to past experience in various places, they are not afraid of the severity of the disaster, but only afraid of the lack of leadership. Where the leadership has foresight and organizes forces to lead the masses to fight against the disaster, it is very likely to overcome the disaster; therefore, the leadership should not be paralyzed beforehand and then panic in an emergency. Strengthening leadership is the key to surviving the famine. Special counties should establish a production and famine relief committee to specifically lead this work. And cadres from relevant departments should be transferred to form several work groups to personally go to the disaster areas to lead the masses in production and famine relief.

　　晋中行署及早防止春荒
  　发出灾区渡荒指示
    【晋中电】晋中行署于本月十二日，发出关于灾区渡荒问题的有关指示。晋中的灾荒完全是日寇的殖民地掠夺与蒋匪的“兵农合一”结果造成人民的生产资料与生产资料曾反复遭受严重破坏，解放后的半年来，经我党政军民的努力，大部地区逐渐复原，但目前的统计仍有十六万四千余人口，无法渡过春荒。据一专区去年十二月估计，无衣无食之灾民，几占灾区人口中的三分之一，如以大力领导，扶植生产，三分之二的灾民可以自救，其余三分之一为老弱残废，无法生产自救。指示中指出：目前灾区工作总方针，主要是发动群众用自己的力量进行生产节约，自救渡荒。在渡荒的具体措施上，指示中提出以下办法：首先在灾区负担上要加以照顾，去年的公粮应酌情减免，在不影响缴纳公粮斤数的情形下，进行调剂。灾情严重的村庄，应减免战勤。在贷款方面对灾区应多予照顾，今春之种贷三千石，与生产贷粮七千石，主要应用之于扶植生产。此外，行署民政处并发一千石救济粮。可利用合作互助方式，先发给老弱残废不能生产的灾民，再组织他们与能劳动生产者进行合作生产。其次，应注意组织群众，抓紧种植早熟及产量大的作物，在不耽误农时下，组织各种副业、手工业及矿业生产。设法组织妇女参加生产，平定在去年战胜灾荒中，近十万妇女参加秋收、刨地、拉犁、做鞋、担挑运输等，解决了很大问题。指示中强调指出：根据各地经验，只要组织生产，救灾就有办法：一专区盂县大方山、西郭秋及忻县韩岩三个灾区，去年一月中，组织开店、小摊贩、豆腐坊、粉坊及编席等生产中，使三个村一千九百口人中，有三分之一的群众解决了生活问题；榆次二区灾区村北田村，现有的二十五户，七十多人在去年十二月间，开豆腐坊、担挑摊贩、组织刨药材、打酸枣、绣花、做鞋等，共赚小米六千余斤，可以维持全村一个月的生活；平定去年战胜灾荒中，有生熟铁炉二百六十座，自前年十二月至去年七月发展到四百三十九座，共收入小米六万余大石。铁矿窑由七十七座发展到四百四十六座，收入小米九千余大石。造纸厂收入小米一万余石。再次为提倡节约，节省粮食，把现有的粮食留到最困难的时候吃，粮食内应尽量掺黑枣、糠麸，春天要大量发动群众采集树叶等代食品。最后，指示中特别提出加强各地渡荒领导，根据以往各地经验，不怕灾荒严重，只怕没有领导。凡领导上有预见，组织力量领导群众与灾荒作斗争的地方，结果很有可能战胜灾荒；因之领导上不要事前麻痹，临时又惊慌失措，加强领导是渡荒的重要关键。专县应成立生产渡荒委员会，专门领导此一工作。并把有关部门的干部抽调出来，组织若干工作组，亲到灾区领导群众生产渡荒。
