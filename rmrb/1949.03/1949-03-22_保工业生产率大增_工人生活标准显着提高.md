　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, March 20th: TASS, Sofia, reports: The nationalization of industry in Bulgaria, the workers' increasing skills, and the widespread labor competitions have greatly increased labor productivity. In 1948, labor productivity in Bulgarian industry increased by 26.7 percent compared to 1947. The growth of labor productivity, the increase in industrial production, and the initial achievements in agricultural development have made it possible to improve the supply of finished goods and food. Last year, Bulgarian workers received twice as many shoes, socks, clothing, and other finished goods as in 1947. The supply of bread, meat, oil, sugar, and other raw products has improved. The two-year national economic plan stipulates an increase of 15 to 20 percent in the total wage bill. In reality, the total wage bill increased by 29.9 percent last year.
    The improvement in the living standards of the Bulgarian working people is not limited to wage increases. It must also include all the social measures taken by the government, reflecting the people's state's concern for its employees. The insurance fund, which was previously drawn from the workers' wages, is now allocated by the enterprises. Paid leave for employees has been extended annually. Subsidies have been doubled. All employees, regardless of their length of employment, and their families enjoy free medical assistance. This year, 350 million leva are planned to be spent on medical treatment and rest facilities. The Bulgarian government is extremely concerned about the children of the working people. In 1944, Bulgaria had only 46 children's homes and two nurseries. Now there are 258 children's homes, 19 nurseries, 2,300 summer kindergartens, 285 outdoor activity areas, 27 children's cultural rooms, and 490 children's medical clinics, etc. In 1939, Bulgaria had only one maternity hospital; now there are 352. In the past two years, 4 billion leva have been spent on the construction of workers' dormitories. In the next five years, the residential area for workers will increase by 1.29 million square meters. According to estimates by the General Trade Union, all these and other government measures will increase the real wages of employees by no less than 25 percent.
    Bulgaria's five-year plan for developing the national economy stipulates further improvements in the living standards of the working people. In 1953, the total wage bill will increase by 64 percent in industry, 80 percent in construction, and 34 percent in transportation compared to 1948. By that time, the supply of finished goods and food to employees will be more than double that of 1948. Bulgaria will spend 48 billion leva on cultural and other service industries in the next five years.

　　保工业生产率大增
    工人生活标准显着提高
    【新华社陕北二十日电】塔斯社索菲亚讯：保加利亚的工业国有化，工人日益提高的技术和广泛的劳动竞赛，已使劳动生产率大为增加。一九四八年保加利亚工业中的劳动生产率，比较一九四七年增加了百分之廿六点七。劳动生产率的增长，工业生产量的增加，和农业发展所获得的最初成就，已经使改进制成品和食品之供应成为可能。去年，保加利亚的工人获得了两倍于一九四七年的鞋袜、被服及其他制成品。面包、肉、油脂、糖及其他生产品的供给都改进了，两年国民经济计划规定工资总数增加百分之十五到二十。实际上，去年工资总数增加了百分之二十九点九。
    保加利亚劳动人民生活标准的改进，并不限于工资的增加，这还必须加上政府所采取的反映着人民国家关怀职工的全部社会措施。保险基金，以前是由工人从他们的工资中拿出来的，现在则改由企业方面拨出。职工每年工资照拨的假期业已延长。扶助金已经加倍。所有的职工不闲其就业年限多少，他们及其眷属一概享受免费的医药补助。今年则准备化费三亿五千保币，在医药治疗和休养设备上。保加利亚政府对于劳动人民的儿童极为关心。一九四四年，保加利亚只有四十六个儿童之家和两个托儿所，现在则有二百五十八个儿童之家，十九个托儿所，二千三百个夏令幼儿园，二百八十五个户外活动场，二十七个儿童文化室以及四百九十个儿童医务所等等。一九三九年，保加利亚只有一个产科医院，现在则有三百五十二个。过去两年中，建筑工人的宿舍化费了四十亿保币。今后五年中，工人的住宅面积将要增加一百二十九万平方公尺。根据总工会的估计，所有这些及其他政府措施，将使职工实际工资增加了不下于百分之二十五。
    保加利亚发展国民经济的五年计划规定了劳动人民生活标准的更加改进。一九五三年工资总额比，一九四八年，在工业方面将增加百分之六十四，建筑业方面增加百分之八十，运输业方面增加百分之三十四。到那时候对于职工的制成品与食品供给将要多于一九四八年的两倍。保加利亚今后五年中化费在文化及其他服务事业上的国家开支将达四百八十亿保币。
