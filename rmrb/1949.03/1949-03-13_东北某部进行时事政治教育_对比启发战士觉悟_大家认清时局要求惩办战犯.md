Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, March 10th. The commanders and Communist Party branch of the "Changling" company of a certain unit of the Northeast Field Army, based on the soldiers' ideological state and political level, encouraged soldiers to raise questions themselves and conduct discussions, and guided them to use concrete facts to unfold debates, gradually raising the soldiers' class consciousness and political understanding.

Some newly liberated soldiers in the company were not very clear about the peaceful liberation of Beiping. The leadership promoted everyone to study this issue first. The soldiers first debated and discussed enthusiastically, and later elected squad leader Shi Guangcai to summarize. Shi Guangcai summarized everyone's opinions and made a clear conclusion. After this discussion, the ideological understanding of both old and newly liberated soldiers was improved.

Next, the leadership encouraged everyone to review the past war and experience the current situation based on their personal experiences. In the discussion, the soldiers believed that the war in the past two years could be divided into three periods: (1) 1946, when the Kuomintang bandit army launched a full-scale offensive and the People's Liberation Army was in a period of arduous struggle. (2) The summer of 1947, when the People's Liberation Army shifted to the offensive. (3) From the autumn offensive of 1948 to today's victory. According to different periods, each group selected figures from the three aspects of us, the enemy, and the masses to explain the situation. When talking about the first period, Jiang Shizhou, a veteran who participated in the Four Defenses of Linjiang (now the second platoon leader), talked about the PLA's hard struggle at that time. Then, Wu Sheng, the third platoon leader of the company who was a soldier in the enemy's 89th Division at that time, talked about the enemy's arrogance. Qu Yongzhong, a soldier who had not yet joined the army at that time, explained the degree of awareness of the people at that time. When discussing the third period, the soldiers compared the current strength and equipment of the company with the past. In this way, all the soldiers not only recognized the development of the situation, but also more deeply understood the source of the PLA's victory. Liu Shufan, a soldier liberated from the Tatun battle south of Jinzhou, said: "I was really moved when I heard it. Without the hardship of the past, there would be no victory today." Many soldiers also said: Don't just see that the enemy is not good today, but forget the enemy's ferocity in the past. There should be no pity for war criminals like Chiang Kai-shek.

Then the question turned to true peace and false peace. The company leadership introduced Chiang Kai-shek's five false peace conditions and Chairman Mao's eight true peace conditions to the soldiers for comparison and comment. In the discussion, the soldiers investigated: Why didn't Chiang Kai-shek mention "peace" in the past? What is the purpose of his five conditions? When discussing Chiang Kai-shek's maintenance of the pseudo-legal system, Peng Yun, a newly liberated soldier, said: "The pseudo-Baochang is still the pseudo-Baochang. He will still help the Kuomintang bully the poor. That won't work!?" When talking about Chiang Kai-shek's continued maintenance of the reactionary army, many soldiers were very angry. Soldier Chen Lifa said: "He still wants to continue to grab poor people to be soldiers!?" Xu Lianqing, who was liberated from Tashan, said: "I was grabbed and filled as a conscript, and my waist was broken by them. Today we are liberated, but we must not forget that there are more than 200 million compatriots in the South suffering! We must liberate all of China." They realized that Chiang Kai-shek's five conditions were all for the purpose of continuing to oppress the working people and for the interests of the big landlords and big bourgeoisie. If these five conditions were accepted, the people would never be able to turn over.

When discussing Chairman Mao's eight peace conditions, the soldiers were all beaming with joy and raised their hands in support. The company headquarters specifically asked: "Can the article on punishing war criminals be revised?" The soldiers said one after another: Chiang Kai-shek and others killed and set fire, and owed the people blood debts. War criminals are guilty and must be punished. The crime of war criminals is the suffering of the people, and today we must repay the blood debt. Many soldiers told about the lifelong suffering they suffered from war criminals, and the personal revenge demands were combined with the idea of "revolution to the end."

### 东北某部进行时事政治教育　对比启发战士觉悟  大家认清时局要求惩办战犯

　　东北某部进行时事政治教育
  　对比启发战士觉悟
    大家认清时局要求惩办战犯
    【新华社北平十日电】东北野战军某部“长岭”连的指挥人员和共产党支部根据战士的思想状况和政治水平，启发战士自己提出问题而又自己进行讨论，并引导他们运用具体事实展开争辩，逐步地提高了战士的阶级觉悟和政治认识。
    该连有某些新解放过来的战士对于北平的和平解放认识不很清楚，领导上便推动大家先就这个问题进行研究。战士们先是热烈地争辩、讨论，后来选出班长石广财总结，石归纳众人的意见，做了一个明确的结论。经过这次讨论，无论老战士或新解放战士，思想认识都提高了一步。
    接着，领导方面又启发大家以亲身经历回顾过去的战争和体验目前的形势。战士们在讨论中认为过去两年多的战争可分三个时期：（一）一九四六年，国民党匪军全面进攻，解放军处于艰苦奋斗时期。（二）一九四七年夏季，解放军转入攻势时期。（三）一九四八年秋季攻势至今日的胜利。根据不同的时期，各组中选出我、敌、群众三方面的人物来说明情况。在谈到第一时期时，由参加四保临江的老战士（现为二排长）姜世州讲当时解放军坚持地苦斗的情形，再由当时在敌八十九师当兵现在该连的三排长的吴生讲述当时敌人的凶焰的高涨；又由当时还未参军的战士曲永忠说明那时人民的觉悟程度。在讨论到第三个时期时，战士们便把今天本连的实力和装备与过去作了对比。这样，全连战士不但认清了形势的发展。而且更深刻地理解到解放军胜利的来源。锦州以南的塔屯战斗解放过来的战士刘书范说：“我听了真是感动，没有过去那样艰苦，就没有今天这样的胜利。”更有许多战士则说：不要光看到今天敌人不行，而忘记了过去敌人的凶暴，对于蒋介石辈战犯是不应该有任何怜惜的。
    于是问题便转到关于真和平和假和平方面。该连领导方面向战士介绍了蒋介石的五项假和平条件和毛主席的八项真和平条件，让战士进行对比评论。战士们在讨论中追究：蒋介石为什么过去不提“和平”？他所提的五条是什么目的？当讨论到蒋介石的保持伪法统一条时，新解放战士彭云说：“伪保长还是伪保长，他还会帮助国民党欺压穷人，那还行！？”在说到蒋介石还要保持反动军队时，许多战士都十分气愤。战士陈礼发说：“他还要继续抓穷人去当兵呀！？”另一塔山解放过来的徐连清说：“我被抓充作壮丁，我的腰给他们打断。今天我们解放了，可不要忘记南方还有二万万多同胞在受苦！我们一定要解放全中国。”他们认识到蒋介石的五条，条条都是为了继续压迫劳动人民，都是为了大地主大资产阶级的利益。要是接受了这五条，人民就永远不能翻身。
    当讨论到毛主席八项和平条件时，战士们个个眉飞色舞，举手拥护。连部特别提问：“惩办战犯这一条能不能修改？”战士们纷纷表示：蒋介石等杀人放火，欠下了人民的血债，战犯有罪一定要惩办。战犯的罪就是人民的苦，今天一定要讨还血债。许多战士都诉说自己所受战犯们给他们的一生痛苦，个人复仇的要求便和“革命到底”的思想结合起来。
