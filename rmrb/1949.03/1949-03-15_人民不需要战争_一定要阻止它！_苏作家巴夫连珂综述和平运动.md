Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, March 14th: Soviet writer and author of "The Flames of Revenge," Pavlenko, summarized the recent progress of the world people's peace movement in the Pravda newspaper on the 10th. He wrote: The declaration jointly issued by the International Liaison Committee of the World Congress of Intellectuals for Peace and the Women's International Democratic Federation has resonated throughout the world. It calls on the people of all countries, regardless of political views or religious beliefs, to work together for world peace, and has been supported by the World Federation of Democratic Youth, the International Union of Students, the French General Confederation of Labor, and many progressive groups in Italy. National committees of cultural workers have been established in France, the United States, Italy, Britain, Brazil, and other countries.

    The words of the great Soviet leader Stalin, calling for an effective struggle for peace, have aroused strong resonance in the hearts of the masses in all countries. The statements by the leaders of the working class in France and Italy, Thorez and Togliatti, regarding the opposition of the French and Italian people to the anti-Soviet war, reflect the will and emotions of millions of people.

    Therefore, the reactionaries are furious. American monopoly capitalists and their lackeys are using terror to deal with those who support peace. The police officers of the French Minister of Interior, Moch, are carrying out one provocation after another against those who call for the defense of peace and progress. The loyal and heroic representatives of the British working class are being persecuted. The secretary of the Indian Progressive Writers Association, the defender of peace, Jaffe, has been imprisoned. The great Chilean poet Neruda is being persecuted. The Cuban poet Guillén and writer Marinello have been repeatedly subjected to "interrogation" for daring to speak the truth. The Turkish progressive writer Dinari was killed by the reactionaries.

    The "Cold War" and the frantic war preparations carried out by imperialism, monopoly capitalists, and their agents are intolerable to human ideals and conscience. We, the people, do not need war. We will handle our future in a different way. We do not want war, and we must stop it!

    The World Congress of Partisans for Peace, to be held in April, will express the will and strength of millions of people to prevent a new war.

    一定要阻止它！
    苏作家巴夫连珂综述和平运动
    【新华社陕北十四日电】苏联作家，“复仇的火焰”的作者巴夫连珂在十日的真理报上综述了最近世界人民和平运动的进展。他写道：世界文化工作者保卫和平大会国际联络委员会和国际民主妇女所共同发表的宣言，已经响彻了全世界。它号召各国人民不分政治主张与宗教信仰，共同为世界和平而奋斗，已经获得世界民主青联、国际学联、法国总工会与意大利许多进步团体的响应。文化工作者的全国委员会已经在法国、美国、意大利、英国、巴西及其他各国建立起来。
    苏联伟大领袖斯大林号召为和平而进行有效斗争的言论，在一切国家人民大众的心里，都已引起了强烈的共鸣。法意两国工人阶级领袖多列士和托格里亚蒂发表的关于法意人民反对反苏战争的声明，反映着千百万人民的意志和情绪。
    因此反动派们狂怒了。美国垄断资本家及其从仆们正在使用恐怖手段，对付拥护和平的人们。法国内政部长摩许的警察人员，对那些呼吁保卫和平和进步的人们，进行一次又一次的挑衅。英国工人阶级忠实英勇的代表们，正在遭受着迫害。印度进步作家协会的秘书、和平的保卫者杰飞，已被关进牢狱。智利的伟大诗人纽达伊斯受了迫害。古巴的诗人吉兰和作家玛利尼洛，因为敢于说出真理而一再遭受“审讯”。土耳其进步作家狄纳里被反动派杀害了。
    帝国主义、垄断资本家及其代理人所进行的“冷战”和疯狂的战争准备，是人类的理想和良心所不能容许的。我们人民是不需要战争的。我们将用与此不同的方法处理我们的将来。我们不要战争，而且一定要阻止它！
    将于四月间召开的世界和平拥护者大会，将表示出千百万人民阻止新战争的意志和力量。
