Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, February 28th: TASS, Paris, February 24th: At a meeting of the Central Committee of the French Communist Party on the 23rd, French Communist leader Thorez, in his concluding remarks, pointed out that the struggle between the imperialist camp, headed by American capitalists, and the anti-imperialist camp of socialism and peace, headed by the Soviet Union, is intensifying throughout the world. "Peace or war will depend on the outcome of this struggle." However, the forces of peace, if united and acting jointly, can repel war.

Thorez referred to the following remarks by Representative Shafer, Vice Chairman of the House Armed Services Committee of the United States: "A contest of strength with the Soviet Union is sooner or later inevitable"; since this is the case, it is better to do it sooner. But Shafer said: "If France says no, difficulties will be encountered from the outset." Thorez emphasized: We now declare clearly: we will not only endeavor to make the situation "difficult," but will make it impossible. To achieve this goal, we strive to unite all good French men and women, to unite all those who are unwilling to see France and the world plunged into a new, horrific war against our ally, the Soviet Union, a war that would cause France to lose its security and reparations and align itself with Nazi Germany and Franco's fascists. Understandably, my statement on the 22nd infuriated the warmongers and their lackeys, because we stripped them of their hypocritical guise as defenders of national interests. To defend their capitalist interests, the privileged groups, fearing social revolution and the establishment of a harmonious society based on freedom and justice, sacrifice the interests of the nation; they are trying to drag the French people into a new anti-Soviet "crusade." Thus, the government's war policy, agreed to by its parliamentary majority and supported by the Gaullist party, exposes its class roots.

Thorez finally emphasized that the Communists will resolutely oppose the movement of the warmongers. They will fully inform the people of the situation. They will tirelessly strive to unite the people to defend peace. The highest task of the Communists is to stand at the forefront of the struggle for peace. Thorez concluded his speech with the following slogan: "Struggle for national independence, peace, and socialism!"

　　多列士演说痛斥战贩
  　呼吁团结和平力量击退战争
    【新华社陕北二十八日电】塔斯社巴黎二十四日讯：法共领袖多列士二十三日在法共中央委员会会议上作结论时指出：以美国资本家为首的帝国主义阵营，和以苏联为首的社会主义与和平的反帝国主义阵营之间的斗争，正在全世界增加中。“和平抑或战争，将决定于这一斗争的结果。”但是，和平的力量，只要团结起来，联合行动，就能够击退战争。
    多列士提起美国众院武装部队委员会副主席雪弗尔的下列谈话：“与苏联较量力量迟早不可避免”；既然如此，倒不如早些好。但是雪弗尔说：“如果法国说不，则一开始就会要碰到困难。”多列士强调称：我们现在明白声明：我们不但要努力使形势“困难”，而且将使之成为不可能。为达此目的，我们努力团结一切善良的法国男女，团结一切这样的人们，这些人们不愿意使法国和全世界被推入新的反对我们盟友苏联的可怖的大战，被推入将使法国丧失其安全和赔偿而与德国纳粹和佛朗哥法西斯为伍的战事中。很可以理解，我在二十二日的声明，激怒了战争贩子及其从仆们，因为我们剥去了他们假装的民族利益保卫者的伪善面貌。特权集团为保卫他们的资本主义利益，害怕社会革命，害怕建立基于自由和正义的亲睦的社会，乃牺牲民族的利益；力图将法国人民卷入新的反苏“十字军”中去。这样，政府得其议会多数派同意并为戴高乐党所支持的战争政策，其阶级根底就暴露无遗了。
    多列士最后强调，共产党人将坚决反对战争贩子的运动。他们将使人民充分了解情况。他们将不疲倦地努力团结人民保卫和平。共产党人的最高任务是站在争取和平的斗争的最前列。多列士以下述口号结束他的演说：“为民族独立、和平和社会主义而斗争！”
