　　Southern Hebei, Eastern Hebei, and Chahar
    Grant Large Amounts of Grain Loans
    [Southern Hebei Telegram] In order to support spring plowing for farmers in disaster areas and prevent spring famine, the Southern Hebei Administrative Office has decided to issue 1.75 million jin of grain and 15 million yuan in RMB as loans to certain counties in the Third and Fourth Special Districts that suffered from disasters last year. Special and county authorities emphasized that these grain loans are specifically for resolving difficulties related to fertilizer, draft animals, and agricultural tools. All or most of the grain loans should be converted into means of production through production promotion cooperatives in disaster areas and directly loaned to producers, and should be combined with the organization of mutual aid. For example, assisting in the joint purchase of oxen and agricultural tools will guide farmers towards the path of mutual aid. However, forced phenomena such as "no mutual aid, no loans" should be avoided. It was also instructed that various localities should uniformly purchase oxen, agricultural tools, etc., through supply and marketing cooperatives, and issue them to farmers in kind, reducing the intermediate exploitation of private merchants. However, in areas where supply and marketing cooperatives are unsound, if unified procurement is not as good as decentralized purchases, then grain and funds should be lent separately, and farmers should handle it themselves.
    [Eastern Hebei Telegram] The Eastern Hebei Administrative Office has recently decided to lend 397,000 jin of cotton seeds, 636,000 jin of peanut seeds, 1,091,000 jin of spring wheat seeds, and 60,000 jin of sweet potato seeds to the entire region in order to expand the planting area of special crops. The Administrative Office also instructed various localities to widely mobilize the masses for mutual aid and lending, with interest rates freely negotiated by both parties.
    [Chahar News] The Chahar Provincial Government has been issuing agricultural loans of 42.5 million yuan in RMB since February 28. This loan includes 14.5 million yuan for waterwheels and wells; 7.955 million yuan for opening canals; 500,000 yuan for afforestation; 900,000 yuan for cotton production; 13.5 million yuan for livestock; and 4 million yuan for pesticides. The remainder is 1.145 million yuan in general loans to solve farmers' difficulties with agricultural tools, fertilizers, seeds, and special products.
    [Chahar News] The Chahar Northern People's Bank Office has recently held two agricultural loans totaling 3 million yuan in RMB.

　　冀南冀东察哈尔
    贷放大批粮款
    【冀南电】冀南行署为扶助灾区农民春耕及预防春荒，决定发放贷粮一百七十五万斤，人民币一千五百万元贷给去年遭灾的三、四专区某些县份。各专、县强调指出此项粮款专为解决肥料、耕畜、农具等困难。应经过灾区各地生产推进社，将全部或大部粮款变成生产资料，直接贷给生产者，并要与组织互助相结合。如扶助伙买耕牛、农具，以引导农民走向互助的道路。但应避免不互助不贷款的强迫现象。并指示各地通过供销社统一购买耕牛、农具等，以实物贷发给农民，减少私商的中间剥削。但供销社不健全的地方，统一收购尚不如分散购买时，则应分贷粮、款，由农民自办。
    【冀东电】冀东行政公署为扩大特种作物播种面积，顷决定向全区贷放棉籽三十九万七千斤，花生种六十三万六千斤，春麦种一百零九万一千斤，白薯种六万斤。行署并指示各地广泛发动群众互助借贷，利息由双方自由商定。
    【察哈尔讯】察哈尔省政府于二月二十八日起，发放农业贷款人民币四千二百五十万元。此项贷款为水车、水井贷款一千四百五十万元；开渠七百九十五万五千元；造林五十万元；棉产九十万元；牲畜款一千三百五十万元；农药四百万元。其他为解决农民农具、肥料、籽种及特产等困难的一般贷款一百一十四万五千元。
    【察哈尔讯】察北人民银行办事处，近二次举办农业贷款人民币三百万元。
