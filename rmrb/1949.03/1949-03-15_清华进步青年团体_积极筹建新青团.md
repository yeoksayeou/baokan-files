　　Tsinghua Progressive Youth Group
  　Actively Prepares to Establish New Youth League
    [Special Dispatch from Our Newspaper] The "New Democratic Youth League" of Tsinghua University in Beiping, a progressive youth organization, was the first to enthusiastically respond to the call of the Beiping Municipal Preparatory Committee of the New Democratic Youth League to establish the league. On March 13th, it convened a representative assembly of league members and a league member assembly, respectively, to establish the "Tsinghua Preparatory Committee of the New Democratic Youth League." Under the leadership of the Beiping Municipal Preparatory Committee of the New Youth League, it will launch the league establishment work starting today.
    The Tsinghua New Democratic Youth League was formed after the liberation by merging six secret revolutionary organizations (Democratic Youth League, New Democratic Youth League, New Democratic Youth League, China Democratic Youth League, New Democratic Chinese Youth League, and New China Democratic Youth League) under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party during the Kuomintang rule. These progressive youth groups were established and grew stronger in the struggle against the Kuomintang's opposition rule. They played a leading and promoting role in the successive student movements in Beiping. After liberation, in the atmosphere of democracy and freedom, they unified and merged, and launched the study of the "Resolution of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China on the Establishment of the Chinese New Democratic Youth League" and the "Draft Constitution of the Chinese New Democratic Youth League," launched criticism and self-criticism, and discussions on the future of the New Democratic Youth League.
    The league convened a representative assembly of league members on March 13th, with 74 representatives attending, representing more than 400 league members remaining at the school. At the meeting, a representative of the Beiping Municipal Preparatory Committee of the New Youth League gave a report on the establishment of the league in Tsinghua. After careful discussion by the representatives, the assembly passed a resolution on the establishment of the league in Tsinghua. The main points are: The work of establishing the league in Tsinghua must be carried out openly in front of the broad masses of students, faculty, staff, and workers of Tsinghua, and in-depth publicity must be carried out first. After full ideological preparation, everyone should be called upon to actively participate in this movement. In the work, it is necessary to closely contact Tsinghua students and prevent the occurrence of adventurism and closed-doorism.
    The assembly elected 30 preparatory committee members, including Wang Hu, Tao Binglun, Huang Qinghua, He Zuoxiu, Ai Zhisheng, Huang Zumin, Yuan Junfu, and Shao Min, and formally established the "Tsinghua Preparatory Committee of the New Democratic Youth League."
    The Preparatory Committee of the Tsinghua New Youth League, with the approval of the Beiping Municipal Preparatory Committee of the New Youth League, will immediately review and approve the transfer of members of the New Youth League to the league and the requests for joining the league from other faculty, staff, students, and workers. It is expected that the inaugural meeting of the New Youth League will be held soon after the first batch of league members join the league.

　　清华进步青年团体
  　积极筹建新青团
    【本报特讯】北平清华大学的进步青年组织“新民主主义青年联盟”，首先热烈响应新民主主义青年团北平市筹委会建团号召，于三月十三日分别召开盟员代表大会和盟员大会，成立“新民主主义青年团清华筹委会”，在新青团平市筹委会领导下，即日起展开建团工作。
    清华新民主主义青年联盟，系在国民党统治时期，在中国共产党领导下的六个秘密革命团体（民主青年同盟、新民主主义青年联盟、新民主主义青年同盟、中华民主青年联盟、新民主主义中国青年联盟和新中国民主青年联盟）在解放后合并组成。这些进步青年团体，是在与国民党反对统治斗争中成立与壮大起来的，在北平历次学运中，曾起了领导与推动的作用。解放后，在民主自由的空气中，统一合并，并展开了对“中共中央关于建立中国新民主主义青年团的决议”和“中国新民主主义青年团团章草案”的学习，展开了批评和自我批评，以及关于新民主主义青年联盟前途的讨论。
    该联盟于三月十三日召开盟员代表大会，到会代表七十四人，代表留校盟员四百余人，会上有新青团北平市筹委会代表关于清华建团的报告，经过与会代表慎重讨论后，大会通过关于清华建团的决议，其要点为：清华建团工作，必须要在清华广大同学、教职员、工友前公开进行，首先进行深入的宣传。经过充分的思想酝酿，然后号召大家踊跃参加到这个运动中来，在工作中必须紧密联系清华同学，防止发生先锋主义和关门主义的偏向。
    大会选出筹备委员王浒、陶炳伦、黄庆华、何祚庥、艾知生、黄祖民、袁君孚、邵敏等三十人，正式成立“新民主主义青年团清华筹委会”。
    清华新青团的筹委会，经新青团北平市筹委会批准，即日起将审查和批准新青联盟员转团及其他教职员、学生和工友的入团要求，预计在第一批团员入团后，最近即将召开新青团成立大会。
