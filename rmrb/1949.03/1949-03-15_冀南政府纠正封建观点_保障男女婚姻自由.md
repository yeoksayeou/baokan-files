Jinnan Telegram: Governments at all levels in Jinnan have adopted various measures to overcome erroneous views in handling marriage issues and safeguard the marriage autonomy of both men and women. According to statistics from seventeen counties including Linqing City, En County, Wuxun, Jing County, Jize, Guangzong, Hengshui, and Ji County, a total of 840 marriage cases were handled from July to December last year. The Jinnan People's Court handled 27 cases in January of this year. Most of these cases involved issues such as abuse, buying and selling of spouses, and arranged marriages by parents. In the process of handling these cases, governments at all levels provided reasonable solutions in accordance with the law. In resolving marriage cases, women's land and property rights were also protected. Women's due share of land and property in the land reform was guaranteed to be sold or taken away. The handling of children was primarily based on the upbringing conditions of both parties, without emphasizing the age of the children. In the Third and Fourth Special Districts, many disguised forms of buying and selling marriages were discovered, where the woman's side demanded money from the man to buy things, with the amounts reaching as high as 1.2 million Jiao or several dozen bags of grain. In reality, these items ended up in the hands of the woman's parents or the matchmaker. The government has also taken effective measures to strictly prevent this. In resolving marriage issues, it was discovered that some cadres had one-sided "consideration" views in their thinking, only paying attention to the difficulty of men marrying wives, while neglecting women's right to freedom of marriage. For example, Wang Changyou from Xishuibo Village in Linqing was over forty years old, and his wife was in her twenties. Wang was extremely strict with the woman, not allowing her to visit her parents' home for three years. The woman secretly ran to the government to request a divorce, but the work team member in the village repeatedly obstructed her, saying, "There are too many bachelors in this village, how can you get a divorce?" These erroneous ideas have been largely corrected or are being corrected.

　　冀南政府纠正封建观点
  　保障男女婚姻自由
    【冀南电】冀南各级政府，采取各种措施，克服处理婚姻问题上的错误观点，保障男女双方的婚姻自主权。据临清市、恩县、武训、景县、鸡泽、广宗、衡水、冀县等十七个县统计，去年七月到十二月内，共处理婚姻案件八百四十起。冀南人民法院今年一月份处理二十七起。多为虐待、买卖、父母包办婚姻等问题。在处理过程中，各级政府均依法予以合理解决。在解决婚姻案件中，妇女的地权财权也获得保障，土地改革中妇女应得之土地财产，保证其可出卖或带走。对小孩处理上是按双方教养条件为主，不强调按年岁大小处理。三、四专区均发现不少变相买卖婚姻，女方向男方要款买东西，多者达冀钞一百二十万元或十几口袋粮食。这些东西实际上是落在女方父母或媒婆之手。政府对此亦采取有效措施，严加制止。在解决婚姻问题中，曾发现某些干部思想上存在着片面的“照顾”观点，只注意照顾男方娶妻不易，忽视了女方婚姻自由的权利。如临清西水波王长有四十余岁，其妻二十余岁，王对女方统治极严，三年不让走娘家，女方偷跑至政府要求离婚，而该村工作组工作员却百般阻挠，并说：“这村光棍汉太多，还能离婚？”这些错误思想，大部已被纠正或正在纠正中。
