In order to help farmers in disaster areas rush to plant spring wheat, the Renqiu County Promotion Cooperative took out 13,000 jin of spring wheat seeds and barley seeds and sold them to farmers at a price that was one-fifth to one-third lower than the market price. With the active support of the government, farmers in counties such as Hejian, Jianguo, and Renhe began to deliver manure as early as the second and third days of the Lunar New Year, and some had already delivered it all.

According to statistics from 305 villages in ten counties including Qin County and Tunliu, more than half of the fertilizer has been prepared. The entire region has purchased more than 3,000 head of livestock from livestock producing areas, most of which were purchased from outside areas with bank loans and transportation earnings.
