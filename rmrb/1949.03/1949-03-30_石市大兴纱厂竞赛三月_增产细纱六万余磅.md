　　Shijiazhuang Da Xing Yarn Factory's Three-Month Competition:
    Increased Production of Over 60,000 Pounds of Fine Yarn
    [Shijiazhuang News] The state-owned Da Xing Yarn Factory in Shijiazhuang recently summarized its three-month campaign to increase production and compensate for losses. From December of last year to the end of February this year, the entire factory increased production by a total of 64,665 pounds of medium-grade fine yarn, 1,881 bolts of "Mountain Deer" cloth, and 2,314 military blankets. A total of 1,792,917 RMB yuan was saved in expenses, procurement, and the use of substitutes. In addition, the cloth factory saved materials, expenses, and labor worth 805 bolts of cloth, which has not yet been calculated. Production efficiency has also greatly improved compared to the past. For example, the maintenance department installed a fine yarn machine, which previously required 50 workers. After the launch of the competition, installing a new machine with 400 spindles only required 25 workers. When the workers moved a fine yarn machine with 288 spindles, they came up with a method of moving the entire machine body without disassembling large parts by disassembling smaller parts, and the entire process was completed by ten workers. The output of the machine shop in November of last year was 5,435 pounds; in January of this year, it produced 12,000 pounds. In terms of invention and creation, the electrical department, in order to inspect and repair electrical appliances, carefully researched and created a copper welding machine, a short-circuit tester, and a cotton yarn wrapping machine. In total, this competition completed more than 95 percent of the planned targets. The reasons for not completing all of the targets were: (1) The lack of unified leadership in the early stages of the competition. The factory management committee did not have good discussions on the factory's production increase plan and implementation, which resulted in inconsistent steps between the Party branch, the administration, and the trade union. Some departments did not have detailed plans, and some departments were not mobilized. The branch factory's competition was later, so the increase in output in December was not significant. (2) After preparations for war, all the machines were rush-repaired, and the mechanical precision was lost. In addition, vegetable oil was used for both car oil and spindle oil, which had high viscosity. During the cold season, breakdowns often occurred. (3) With the liberation of Peiping and Tianjin, the factory transferred 80 experienced and technical workers on December 16th, and most of the replacements were unskilled apprentice workers, which affected production efficiency.
    (Note: "Compensating for Losses" refers to compensating for losses. Last winter, the Kuomintang bandit army in Peiping attempted to launch a sneak attack on Shijiazhuang. Various factories were affected production due to war preparations. After repelling the bandit army's sneak attack, the factories launched a campaign to increase production and compensate for losses in order to make up for the production losses during the war preparations.)

　　石市大兴纱厂竞赛三月
    增产细纱六万余磅
    【石家庄讯】石家庄公营大兴纱厂顷总结三月来增产补损竞赛运动。自去年十二月份起，至今年二月底三个月中，全厂共增产中等细纱六万四千六百六十五磅，山鹿布一千八百八十一匹，军毯二千三百一十四条。开支、采购以及使用代用品共节省人民币一百七十九万二千九百十七元，另外布厂节省物料、费用、人工共值布八百零五匹尚未计算在内。在生产效率上亦较前大为提高。如保全科装置细纱机一台，在以前要用五十个工，开展竞赛后，装置四百锭子的新车只用二十五个工，移装一台二八八锭子的细纱机时，职工想出一个拆小零件不拆大件，把整个机体搬移的办法，十个工就全部完成了。机械科翻纱去年十一月份的生产量是五千四百三十五磅；今年一月生产一万二千磅。在创造发明方面：电气科为了检查修理电具，大家细心研究创造了铜焊机，短路试验器与包缠棉纱机等。总计此次竞赛，共完成预定计划百分之九十五以上。未能全部完成的原因：（一）竞赛初期缺乏统一领导，工厂管理委员会对厂方的增产计划与实施没有很好的讨论，形成了支部、行政与工会的步调不一致。有的部门没有详细计划，有的部门没有发动起来。分厂竞赛较迟，故十二月份增补产量不多。（二）备战后，机器全经抢修，机械失准，加之车油和锭子油都用植物油，黏度大，时值天寒季节，时生故障。（三）平津解放，该厂在十二月十六日即调走八十余名熟练与技术职工，而后补充的大部是不熟练的养成工，因此生产效率受影响。
    （按“补损”系补偿损失之谓。去冬北平国民党匪军曾图偷袭石家庄，各工厂因备战而影响生产。当击退匪军偷袭后，各厂即展开增产补损运动，以弥补备战期间之生产上的损失。）
