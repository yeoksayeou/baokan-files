　　Attending the World Congress of Defenders of Peace
　　Our Delegation Departs Today
　　The Beiping Municipal Government Held a Farewell Meeting Before Departure
　　[Reported by this newspaper] The Chinese delegation to the World Congress of Defenders of Peace will depart by special train at 1:20 PM today. In recent days, the delegation has solicited opinions from all walks of life regarding attending the Peace Congress and has collected much material on the economic and cultural construction of the Chinese Liberated Areas. All preparations are now complete. They will tell peace-loving people all over the world that the Chinese people, under the leadership of the Communist Party, have defeated the traitorous Chiang Kai-shek regime, which was fully supported by American imperialism, and will soon completely defeat it. As long as the peace-loving people of all countries in the world firmly unite around the Communist Parties of their respective countries and unite around the Soviet Union, the bulwark of world peace, lasting peace can certainly be achieved, and the crisis of a new world war created by American imperialism can certainly be overcome.
　　On the eve of their departure, at 3:00 PM on the 27th, the delegation held a tea party at the Beijing Hotel, unanimously passed the delegation's tasks and organizational charter, and specially invited Comrade Zhou Enlai to give a farewell speech. On the evening of the same day at 7:00 PM, the Beiping Municipal Government held a farewell gathering for the delegation at the National Grand Theater on West Chang'an Street, and also welcomed democratic figures who had recently arrived in Beiping from Hong Kong, Shanghai, and other places. Representatives to the National Women's Congress, all the democratic figures who had arrived in Beiping successively, and personnel from various organizations and groups, totaling more than 2,000 people, attended the evening party. The atmosphere at the venue was extremely warm and joyful. The event began with a farewell and welcome speech by Mayor Ye Jianying, followed by speeches by Guo Moruo and Ma Yinchu, the head and deputy head of the delegation, and Mr. Huang Yanpei and Mr. Chen Shutong, representatives of the democratic figures who had recently arrived in Beiping. After Huang Yanpei recounted the facts of the people of Jiangnan yearning for liberation, he said: "I am not here to be welcomed, but to welcome the People's Liberation Army to cross the river!" The evening party ended at 11:00 PM in great joy.
