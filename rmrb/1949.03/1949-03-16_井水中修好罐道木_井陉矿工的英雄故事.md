　　Repairing the Shaft Guides in the Well Water
　　The Heroic Story of the Jingxing Miners
　　By Our Reporter Wei Jin
　　The entire staff of the Jingxing Coal Mine is spreading a remarkable story – the heroic deed of young miners Liu Shuntang, Li Xiaodan, and Wu Chengxiang, who repaired the shaft guides in the well water, more than a meter deep, for four consecutive days in severe cold weather. The following is the account of this event:
　　When the Jingxing Coal Mine was liberated, the new well, 254 meters deep, was flooded to a depth of over 30 meters. From February to November of last year, the water cage pumped water day and night, finally draining more than 20 meters. But suddenly, it was discovered that the water cage could no longer descend to pump water; it turned out that one of the two shaft guides that the water cage relied on to descend had rotted.
　　The location of the damage to the shaft guide was very unfavorable: it was not damaged in the section above the water surface, but in a section about five meters long underwater, requiring repairs at a depth of one or two zhang (3-6 meters). This was during the severe winter freezing weather, who would have the courage to dive into the water?
　　If it wasn't repaired? The water cage couldn't descend to pump water, and the water would quickly rise to its original level and continue to rise, eventually flooding the entire coal well. This would be a serious problem, not only rendering the past eight or nine months of pumping water useless, but also preventing coal production in the future. Among the three coal wells in the Jingxing Mine, this one produced the best and most coal (once producing two or three thousand tons of coal per day), and if it couldn't produce coal, the Jingxing Mine would produce at least half less coal for the whole year.
　　How anxious the factory was! They immediately called on workers who could swim to go down and repair it. Liu Shuntang, Li Xiaodan, and Wu Chengxiang, three young workers thought: The Communist Party has liberated us, our economic and political lives have improved, we have become the masters of the mine, and now the mine is about to be flooded, how can we not care? Even if it means sacrificing our lives, we must try to save it! Therefore, they responded to this call.
　　On the afternoon of November 11th last year, they went down to repair the shaft guides. The cold wind was fierce, and the water accumulated at the wellside had long frozen into ice. When they took off their cotton clothes and stood naked on the ice at the wellside, everyone around them shrugged their shoulders and shivered.
　　Riding the water cage down to the water level in the well, more than 200 meters deep, the inside of the well was gloomy and dark, the wind was howling (the strong wind blowing down from the well opening), the rain was pouring (the water flowing from the well's holes was blown by the wind like rain), and the well water was shaken by the wind and rain, crashing against the surrounding rocks. This scene was frightening. But these three comrades bravely held hands and "splashed" into the water.
　　The well water was murky, and nothing could be seen, but there were all sorts of things in the water: air pipes, water pipes, iron plates, iron beams... etc., which could injure the body at any time; and if you were to get trapped inside an iron beam, you would not be able to get out. To avoid these dangers, they slowly groped in the water. After groping for one or two minutes, reaching a depth of more than one zhang and six chi (approximately 5.3 meters), to the end of the damaged shaft guide, they could no longer breathe. They gulped down several mouthfuls of dirty water, which had the foul smell of rust and oil, which was extremely unpleasant. Having no other choice they climbed up to catch their breath.
　　Although the water cage had prepared a pot of roaring fire, they were still shivering from the cold and unable to stand up. But thinking that they had not yet done any work, they anxiously jumped back into the water, regardless of everything. As usual, they drilled in the water for one or two minutes, again unable to breathe, again drinking a few mouthfuls of dirty water, again climbing up, then jumping down again... Until they measured the size of the damaged shaft guide, removed it, and pushed the screws behind the iron beam (the shaft guide was next to the iron beam, with screws passing through it), they had been in the water dozens of times, working from two o'clock in the afternoon until after one o'clock at night. What did they look like frozen? Their skin turned purple-red, their bodies were numb, and they probably wouldn't feel the pain even if a piece of meat was cut off; their minds were dazed, unable to speak, only smiling like fools. The fire in the room was so hot that others couldn't even enter, but Li Xiaodan simply sat on the fire to bake. Later, everyone was covered with several quilts and pressed down by two people, and after more than an hour, they slowly warmed up.
　　The next day, all the bones in their bodies felt like they were being bitten by insects, and their eyes were flooded by the dirty water, requiring them to open their mouths to open their eyes. In principle, they should rest for a day or two; but delaying one day would cause the water to rise by more than one chi (approx 0.33 meters), making the repair work even more difficult. They resolutely refused to rest, gritted their teeth, and continued to work. After diving into the water for four consecutive days, they finally installed the new shaft guides, and the water cage started pumping water again.
　　They have completed this arduous task, and they have received unparalleled honor. The factory and the trade union will give them rewards and praise. All the employees are proud of their unparalleled heroic actions, and everyone declares in unison: "We must learn from their spirit of serving the people!"

　　井水中修好罐道木
  　井陉矿工的英雄故事
    本报记者  维进
    井陉煤矿全体职工，传颂着一件难能可贵的事情——青年矿工刘顺堂、李小旦、吴成祥于严寒天气，在煤井一丈余深的水中，连续四天修理好罐道木的英雄事迹。下面，就是这件事情的经过：
    井陉煤矿解放的时候，二百五十四米深的新井给水淹了三十余米深。从去年二月到十一月，水罐笼连日连夜的打水，好容易打了二十余米水。但是忽然发现水罐笼不能下去打水了；原来水罐笼赖以沿着而下的两条罐道木，有一条已经朽坏了。
    罐道木坏的位置很不好：不是坏在水面上的一段，而是坏了水中长约五米的一段，要下到一、二丈深的水里才好修理。这时正是严冬结冰的天气，谁还有这个胆量钻进水里去呢！
    不修理吗？水罐笼不能下去打水，水就要很快涨到原来的水位，并且还要不断地上涨，乃至把整个煤井淹掉。这样，问题就严重了，不仅过去打了八、九个月的水全工尽弃，而且今后也将不能出煤了。井陉矿三个煤井，数这个煤井出煤最好最多（曾经每天出煤二、三千吨），要是不能出煤，井陉矿全年至少要少出一半的煤。
    厂方多么焦急呵，他们当即号召会水的工人下水修理。刘顺堂、李小旦、吴成祥，三个年轻的工人想到：共产党把我们解放了，我们的经济生活政治生活都改善了，当了矿山的主人了，现在矿山快要给水淹掉，还能不管？就是牺牲了性命也要去挽救！因此，他们响应了这个号召。
    去年十一月十一日下午，他们下水修理罐道木了，寒风刮得实在厉害，井边积下的水早就冻结成冰。当他们脱掉棉衣赤条条的立在井边冰凌上的时候，旁人都耸起肩膊打着寒噤。
    乘着水罐笼降落到二百余米深的井下挨水的地方的时候，那井里面阴沉沉黑洞洞，风在吼叫（井上刮下的大风），雨在淋着（由井桶窟窿中流下的水给风刮的如下雨一般），井水给风雨震动的冲击着周围的石头哗啦啦地响着。这种情景，使人感到心惊胆怕。但是这三个工友，却英勇地手拉着手，“哗啦”一声便跳进水中去了。
    井水里是混浊的，什么都看不见，但是水中什么东西都有，气管、水管、铁盘、铁梁……等等，随时可以碰伤身体；如果要钻到铁梁里头的话，那就出不来了。为了避免这些危险，他们在水中慢慢的摸索，摸了一、二分钟，摸到一丈六尺多深，即坏罐道木末端的时候，已经换不过气了，咕咚咕咚喝了几口脏水，水里有铁锈、机油的恶臭，实在难闻极了，没有办法就钻上来，喘息一会。
    水罐笼虽然预备了一盆旺盛的炉火，他们还是冻的打抖，立不起来。但是想到还没有干下一个样子，就焦急的不顾一切又跳进水中去了。照例在水中钻了一、二分钟，又换不过气，又喝了几口脏水，又钻上来，接着又跳下去……直到量好坏罐道木的尺寸，把它搬掉，把螺丝钉推到铁梁后面（罐道木挨着铁梁，有螺丝钉穿过去的）为止，他们已经下水几十次，从白天下午二时开始工作，直工作到了夜里一点多钟，冻成什么样子呢？皮肤变成紫红色，浑身麻木，恐怕刀子割掉一块肉也不知痛了；脑子是迷迷糊糊的，不会说话，只会傻子似的笑着。房里的炉火热得旁人都不能进去，李小旦却干脆一屁股坐在炉火上烤，后来每人盖上几条被子，又压上两个人，过了一点多钟，才慢慢地暖过来。
    第二天，他们全身的骨头好象给虫咬着似的一阵阵发痛，眼晴给脏水淹的必须张开嘴巴才能睁开。按理他们应该休息一两天了；但是耽误一天，水就要涨一尺多，下水修理就越发困难了。他们坚决不休息，咬紧牙关，继续工作。一连下水四天，终于把新罐道木按上去，水罐笼重新打起水来了。
    他们完成这件艰险的工作，他们获得了无上的荣誉，厂方和职工会给他们以奖励和表扬，全体职工因为他们这一无比英勇的行为而骄傲，大家同声宣称：“要学习他们为人民服务的精神”！
