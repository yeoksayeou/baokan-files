Xinhua News Agency, Ulanhot, 25th -- Dalai Lake (formerly known as Hulun Nur, 30 kilometers northeast of Manzhouli), known as the "Treasure Trove" of Inner Mongolia, has completed its winter fishing plan of 3,000 tons under the leadership of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Government. After the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Government established the Fisheries Company last year, it organized more than 600 fishermen along the coast to form a trade union in April of the same year, and planned to operate three large fishing grounds along the lake. Because the lake is far from the city and transportation is inconvenient, and the climate is warm in spring and autumn, it is difficult to promote fish products. Therefore, only about 100 days in winter is the best time for production. In order to complete the production plan, the Fisheries Company made full use of the time before the opening of the nets to establish fishermen's production groups, clinics, clubs and other organizations. At the same time, through fishermen training classes and fishermen representative meetings, the fishermen's education was carried out to raise their awareness and do all the preparatory work. When the fishing season began, the fishermen launched fishing competitions one after another, showing unprecedented high labor enthusiasm. During the 95 days of winter fishing in the entire lake, 70 fishing models appeared successively, and another 60 young people joined the New Democratic Youth League.

　　内蒙达赍湖是聚宝盆
    人民政府组织渔民生产
    一个冬季捕鱼三千吨
    【新华社乌兰浩特二十五日电】被称为内蒙“聚宝盆”的达赍湖（旧称呼伦诺尔，在满洲里东北三十公里），沿岸渔民在内蒙自治政府领导下，已完成冬季捕鱼三千吨的计划。去年内蒙自治政府建立渔业公司后，即于同年四月组织了沿岸六百余渔民成立了工会，并有计划地在湖滨经营了三个大渔场。由于该湖距都市较远，交通不便，夏秋两季气候温暖，渔产难以推销，故只有冬季百天左右是进行生产的最好时机。渔业公司为了完成生产计划，遂于开网前利用充分的时间，一面建立渔民生产小组及医疗所、俱乐部等组织，同时并通过渔工训练班及渔民代表会等形式，进行对渔民的教育，提高其觉悟程度，做好一切准备工作。至捕鱼季节开始，渔民即纷纷发起捕鱼竞赛，表现了空前高涨的劳动热情。全湖冬季捕鱼九十五天，先后出现的捕鱼模范有七十名，另有六十名青年参加了新民主主义青年团。
