Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, March 30th: TASS, Paris dispatch: Since the publication of the North Atlantic Treaty, the diplomatic activities of the United States, Britain, and France regarding the West German government issue have been greatly strengthened. They have made great efforts to resolve the differences among the three countries on certain issues of their policy toward West Germany as soon as possible. U.S., British, and French diplomatic representatives held several meetings in London last week. On March 21st, Bevin conferred with U.S. Ambassador Douglas and French Ambassador Massigli to discuss removing certain German factories from the previously decided dismantling list. Information obtained by the press indicates that the three countries have reached an agreement on this issue, with Britain and France agreeing to retain 167 previously designated factories in West Germany that were slated for dismantling. Other reports say that the divisions within the committee drafting the so-called West German "Occupation Statute" "are being eliminated." In this regard, Britain and France have also had to yield to U.S. demands. On March 23rd, U.S. Military Governor for Germany Clay visited London, where he conferred with U.S. Ambassador to Britain Douglas on accelerating the establishment of the West German government. The Paris press believes that the strengthened activities of the U.S., Britain, and France on German policy are directly related to the conclusion of the North Atlantic Treaty. The purpose pursued by the discussions and meetings in the past week is to accelerate the legalization of Germany's division and the establishment of a West German government. The upcoming meeting between U.S. Secretary of State Acheson, British Foreign Secretary Bevin, and French Foreign Minister Schuman is of particular importance. Bevin and Schuman will arrive in Washington soon to participate in the signing of the North Atlantic Treaty. It is said that Acheson, Bevin, and Schuman will discuss the future of Germany after the establishment of the West German government, especially the issue of Germany's participation in the North Atlantic Treaty.

　　阴谋把西德当作侵苏基地
    美英法加强外交活动
    竟协议不拆西德军火厂
    【新华社北平三十日电】塔斯社巴黎讯：自北大西洋公约公布以来，美英法在其有关对西德政府问题上的外交活动，已大大加强。它们曾作极大努力，以求尽早解决三国间在其对西德政策某些问题上的分歧。美、英、法外交代表上周曾在伦敦举行过几次会议。三月二十一日，贝文曾与美大使道格拉斯及法大使马西格里商谈，讨论从以前决定的拆卸名单上勾去某些德国工厂。报界所获得的消息显示，在这个问题上，三国已达到协议，英、法同意了在西德保留一百六十七个先前指定拆卸的工厂。还有些消息说：伦敦草拟所谓西德“占领法规”委员会中的分歧“正被消除”。在这方面，也有英法不得不对美国的要求让步。三月二十三日，德境美国军事总督克莱曾访伦敦，在该处与美驻英大使道格拉斯商谈加速西德政府的成立。巴黎新闻界认为：美、英、法在对德政策上的加强活动，是直接与北大西洋公约的缔结有关的。上周中的商谈和会议，其所追逐的目的，是加速使德国的分裂合法化和建立西德政府。美国务卿艾奇逊、英外相贝文和法外长舒曼间不久将举行的会谈，有特别的重要性。贝文、舒曼在不久以后就会抵达华府，参加北大西洋公约的签字。据称，艾奇逊、贝文和舒曼，将讨论西德政府建立后德国的前途，特别是德国参加北大西洋公约的问题。
