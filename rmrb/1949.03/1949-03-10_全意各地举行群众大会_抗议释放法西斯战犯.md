Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 6th. Reports from various sources: Under the initiative of the All-Italy Partisan Association, mass rallies were held in all major Italian cities and regions that were centers of partisan warfare during the Italian Liberation War at the end of February. The rallies protested the Gasperi government's release of Fascist war criminals Prince Borghese and General Roatta, commander of the Fascist Special Forces, and protested the government's persecution of former participants in the resistance movement. All mass and democratic organizations in Italy support the call of the All-Italy Partisan Association, which is currently distributing a proclamation to the people, calling on residents to participate in protest rallies in various locations.

　　In Rome, 15,000 people participated in the protest rally, and police armed with machine guns and tanks surrounded the venue. However, the police failed to provoke a single incident during the meeting. Italian prominent partisan leader and chairman of the All-Italy Partisan Association, Boldrini, strongly criticized the government's policy at the rally, condemning the government's blatant release of Fascists and its despicable campaign to persecute the fighters who liberated Italy under various sophistical pretexts. Boldrini said: "We are gathered here not only to commemorate the struggle of the 400,000 Italian partisans, or only to mourn the 75,000 who gave their lives in the struggle. We are gathered here to protect the fruits that the people have gained in this struggle."

　　At the rally held in Florence, Italian Communist Party Deputy Secretary-General Secchia delivered a speech stating that the mass rallies currently being held in Italy are not only intended to express the people's righteous indignation at the release of Borghese and the persecution of freedom fighters, but also to warn the Italian people: "Freedom and peace are threatened in our country."

　　In Milan, participants in the protest rally marched through the city after the meeting, laying wreaths at the monument to partisan war heroes.

　　Italian Communist Party Deputy Secretary-General Longo submitted a motion in parliament requesting an investigation into the court's release of Borghese. The motion is scheduled for debate in parliament on March 7.

　　全意各地举行群众大会
  　抗议释放法西斯战犯
    【新华社陕北六日电】各方报导：在全意游击队协会发起之下，意大利一切大城镇以及意大利解放战争中游击战中心的地区，均于二月底举行群众大会，抗议加斯贝利政府释放法西斯大战犯波基斯王子和法西斯特种兵团司令罗亚塔，抗议政府迫害以前抵抗运动的参加者。意大利一切群众性的和民主的组织，都支持全意游击队协会的号召，该会现正散发告人民书，号召居民参加各地的抗议大会。
    在罗马，参加抗议大会的群众达一万五千人，装备着机关枪和坦克的警察，包围着会场。然而，在开会期间，警察未能挑起一次事件。意大利杰出的游击队领袖全意游击队协会主席波尔德里尼在大会上痛斥政府的政策，谴责政府公然释放法西斯分子，并在各种诡辩的借口下进行迫害解放意大利的战士的卑鄙运动。波尔德里尼说：“我们在这里集会，不能仅限于纪念意大利四十万游击队员的斗争，或仅限于追悼在斗争中贡献了他们生命的七万五千人。我们在这里集会，是为了保护人民在这一斗争中所获得的果实”。
    在佛罗伦萨举行的大会上，意共副总书记谢杰发表演说称：意大利现在举行的群众大会，其目的不仅在于表示人民对于释放波基斯和迫害争自由的战士的义愤，也在于向意大利人民发出警告：“自由与和平在我们国家受到威胁。”
    在米兰，参加抗议大会的群众在会后列队通过全市，向游击战英雄的纪念碑奉献花圈。
    意共副总书记隆哥在议会中提出动议，要求调查法庭释放波基斯案。该项动议定于三月七日在议会举行辩论。
