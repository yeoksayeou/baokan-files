　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, March 24th: TASS, Moscow: *Pravda* published an editorial on the 21st entitled "The Friendship Between the Soviet Union and Korea is Strengthening," pointing out that the conclusion of the Soviet-Korean Agreement on Economic and Cultural Cooperation and three other agreements will play a significant role in further strengthening the friendly relations between the peoples of the Soviet Union and Korea; at the same time, these agreements are a major contribution to the struggle of the people of the Far East and the world for world peace.
    The editorial emphasized that the Soviet Union has always been faithful to the principle of international cooperation based on respect for the sovereignty of all nations and strictly abides by its international obligations. The Soviet Union has provided assistance to the Korean people in their struggle for independence and steady development. In the Moscow Conference of the Foreign Ministers of the Soviet Union, the United States, and the United Kingdom, in the Soviet-American Joint Commission on the Korean issue, in the United Nations conferences, and in all practical actions of the Soviet Union, the Soviet Union has safeguarded the interests of the Korean people. The Soviet Union has withdrawn its troops from Korea and proposed that the United States also withdraw its troops from Korea. However, the American expansionists have hindered the implementation of the Moscow Conference's decisions on the Korean issue and refused to withdraw American troops from Korea, pursuing a policy of splitting Korea and turning South Korea into a colony of American monopoly capitalists.

　　真理报社论：苏鲜友谊在加强中
    【新华社陕北二十四日电】塔斯社莫斯科讯：真理报二十一日以“苏联与朝鲜的友谊在加强中”为题发表社论，指出苏联与朝鲜经济文化合作协定及其他三个协定的缔结，将在苏鲜两国人民友好关系的进一步加强中起重大的作用；同时，这些协定，对于远东和全世界人民争取世界和平的斗争，是一重大贡献。
    社论强调指出：苏联一贯忠实于其他尊重一切民族之主权为基础的国际合作原则，严格遵守其所承担的国际议务。在朝鲜人民为争取本乎独立与稳步发展的斗争中，苏联曾给以帮助。在苏、美、英三国外长的莫斯科会议上、在朝鲜问题的苏美联合委员会上、在联合国会议上，以及在苏联的一切实际行动中，苏联都维护了朝鲜人民的利益。苏联已从朝鲜人民的利益。苏联已从朝鲜撤退军队，并建议美国亦从朝鲜撤退美军。但是，美国扩张主义者阻碍了莫斯科会议对朝鲜问题决定的履行，并拒绝从朝鲜撤退美军；执行着分裂朝鲜的政策，并将南朝鲜变成美国垄断资本家的殖民地。
