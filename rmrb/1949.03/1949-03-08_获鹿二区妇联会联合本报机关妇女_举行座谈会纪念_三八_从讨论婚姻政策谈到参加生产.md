　　Women's Federation of the Second District of Huolu County Joins Women of This Newspaper to Hold a Symposium in Commemoration of "March 8th"
    From Discussing Marriage Policies to Participating in Production

    [Reported by This Newspaper] To commemorate "March 8th", the women of this newspaper's organization and the Women's Federation of the Second District of Huolu County, where it is stationed, jointly held a symposium on women's issues on March 5th. In addition to the person in charge of the District Women's Federation and the Communist Party District Committee, and three women representatives from this newspaper, there were also 25 women representatives from eleven villages. At the beginning of the meeting, Comrade Han of the Communist Party District Committee reported the significance of the meeting and reviewed the District Committee's past lack of attention to women's work. At the same time, he pointed out the importance of women's work, and hoped that everyone would raise more questions in order to strengthen leadership in this work in the future. Then, the women representatives from this newspaper briefly introduced the Central Committee's decision on rural women's work. Subsequently, the women attending the meeting spoke one after another. First, An Yongzhen, a women representative from Dongjiao Village, said: Since the village women's federation director and committee members returned from a meeting in the district last December and publicized the democratic government's marriage policy, many young women have requested to dissolve marriage contracts arranged by their parents in the past. Some parents couldn't understand this and used threats, even refusing to let their daughters eat or stay at home. The Women's Federation supported them, explaining that daughters have the same share of land and property as boys. If the adults drive them out, we can reason with the family. At the same time, we explained that this social habit problem should be addressed slowly, and shouldn't cause too much trouble. Now eleven women have dissolved old arranged marriages. But there are still many girls who are threatened by their parents,不敢出门during the day, and secretly sneak out in the evening to express their opinions. The problem has not been resolved. Then she expressed: "I fully support the method of unconditional dissolution of marriage contracts for those who cannot afford to return the bride price. If we always restrict the failure to return the bride price and not annul the marriage, the problem will be dragged on, causing women even more pain." Her opinion was unanimously approved by the representatives attending the meeting. Li Yumei, a representative from Pei Village, said: "In my village, there are three or four couples who married freely, and their relationship is very good. The masses reflect: 'Look, they discuss things with each other when things happen, and they live such a good life. Free marriage is better.'" Then several representatives raised the question of how to deal with women with hooligan and corrupt behavior who consistently refuse to change and also want a divorce; and some women who had a good relationship with their husbands in the past, but now want a divorce because their husbands were injured in the army and returned home? During the discussion, everyone agreed that such women should be given more education to promote family harmony as much as possible. Then everyone turned the discussion to production. The representative from Dongzhuang Village pointed out that the women in their village help each other to make shoes, which is very profitable. All 49 able-bodied women in the village participated. Because of the close division of labor, the women's shoe-making skills and speed have improved rapidly. On average, each person can make one pair a day, including the soles and uppers. Each pair of shoes can earn a net profit of 150 yuan in RMB. In addition to making shoes for public use, they also buy their own materials to make shoes. The village has less land than other villages, but the life is very good. They requested that the government provide assistance in supply and marketing. In terms of military-civilian relations, the situation in Pei Village is better. The troops stationed in the village often help the villagers with production, and the Women's Federation automatically repeatedly asked to help them with needlework. In the past two days, they helped dismantle and wash more than 50 sets of clothes. Comrade Han of the Communist Party District Committee immediately praised these good model deeds, saying: "Marriage problems are troubles left over from the old society, and the democratic government will definitely solve them for everyone in accordance with the law and reason." He also expressed that they would strengthen the leadership of women's production in the future. Then the women representatives from Nanbaozhuang, Pei Village, Dongjiao and four or five other villages raised the issue of reorganizing the Women's Federation organizations. Because the old Women's Federation cadres were removed after the equal distribution of land last year, the work has not yet returned to normal. The director of the District Women's Federation immediately expressed her determination to go to the villages soon to help them deal with this problem. The meeting proceeded in a tense and joyful atmosphere from beginning to end, and did not end until about 4 pm.

　　获鹿二区妇联会联合本报机关妇女
    举行座谈会纪念“三八”
    从讨论婚姻政策谈到参加生产
    【本报讯】为纪念“三八”，本报机关妇女与驻地之获鹿县二区区妇联会，于三月五日联合召开妇女问题座谈会，除区妇联会及共产党区委会负责人及本报妇女代表三人外，与会尚有十一个村的二十五位妇女代表，开会时首由共产党区委韩同志，报告了开会意议，将区委过去对妇女工作的重视不够，作了检讨。同时指出妇女工作的重要，为今后加强对这一工作领导，希望大家多多提出问题。接着由本报机关妇女代表将中央关于农村妇女工作的决定作了扼要介绍。随后到会妇女即纷纷发言，首由东焦村妇女代表安永贞发言，她说：自去年十二月村妇联主任与委员从区上开会回来，对民主政府的婚姻政策作了宣传以后，就有许多青年妇女要求解除父母过去包办所订的婚约，有些父母想不通，便用威胁办法，甚至不叫闺女们吃饭、在家住。妇联会便一方面给她们撑腰，说明闺女和男孩有同样的一份土地财产，如果大人们把她们撵出来，咱们就可以和家庭讲道理，同时说明这个社会习惯问题，要慢慢来，不要闹得大厉害。现在已有十一个妇女解除了旧的包办婚约。但还有不少女孩，受着父母的威胁，白天不敢出门，黄昏偷跑出来提一下意见，问题尚未得到解决。接着她又表示：对解除婚约中退不起财礼者无条件解除的办法十分拥护，她说：“如果老是限制不退财礼不退婚，问题就拖下来了，使妇女更加痛苦。”她的意见，得到到会代表的一致赞同。裴村代表李玉梅说：“我村有三、四个自由结婚的，感情都很好，群众反映说：你看人家有事互相商量，日子过的多好，还是自由婚好。”接着又有几位代表提出这些有流氓腐化行为的妇女，一贯不改，也要离婚；有些妇女过去和男人的感情好，因男人参军负伤归家，就要闹离婚等问题，应如何处理？讨论中大家一致认为对于这样的妇女应加强教育，尽量促使其家庭和睦。接着大家又把讨论的主题转到生产上来。东庄村代表提出该村妇女互助做鞋，得利很大。全村四十九个壮年妇女都参加了，因分工严密，妇女做鞋的技术与速率提高得很快，连底带帮每天每人平均可做一双，每双鞋可净赚人民币一百五十元，除包做公鞋外，还自己买材料作。村里土地比外村少，但生活却很好，她们要求政府能在供销方面给以帮助。在军民关系上，以裴村代表的反映较好。驻村×××经常帮助老乡们生产，妇联会就自动再三再四要求帮她们做针线活。最近的两天多就帮助拆洗了五十余套衣服。共产党区委韩同志对这些好的模范事迹，当即予以表扬，她说：“婚姻问题是旧社会遗留下的麻烦，民主政府一定依法依情给大家解决。”并表示今后要加强对妇女的生产领导。接着又有南保庄、裴村、东焦等四、五个村庄的妇女代表提出要求整顿妇联组织问题，因去年平分中旧的妇联干部被撤职后，至今工作仍未上个轨道。区妇联主任对此问题当即表示决心很快到村，帮助她们处理。会议自始至终在紧张而欢快的空气中进行，至下午四时许始散会。
