A brief explanation of terms

　　What does "The sky is low over Wu and Chu" and "Eyes see nothing" mean?
　　Editor: In the article "The Kuomintang reactionary group is already fragmented, yet they still shout empty slogans of 'overall peace'" (Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 15th) published in your newspaper on February 17th, there are the phrases "The sky is low over Wu and Chu" and "Eyes see nothing." From which classics do they come? What do they mean? Please explain.

　　　　　　Ding Jingping
　　Comrade Ding Jingping: "The sky is low over Wu and Chu" and "Eyes see nothing" are borrowed from the "Nian Nu Jiao Ci" written by Sa Dula of the Yuan Dynasty. The original poem says: "On Stone City, gazing, the sky is low over Wu and Chu, eyes see nothing, the scenic site of the Six Dynasties, only green mountains remain like jade," and so on; meaning: The past splendor of Nanjing is all gone, only "the sky is low over Wu and Chu" remains. Chu refers to the area north of the Yangtze River, and Wu refers to the area south of the Yangtze River. Wu and Chu generally refer to the southeast.

专栏：名词浅释

　　“天低吴楚”“眼空无物”是什么意思？
    编者同志：二月十七日贵报所载“国民党反动集团既已四分五裂，还空喊什么‘全面和平’”（新华社陕北十五日电）一文中，有“天低吴楚”“眼空无物”二语，不知出自何典？其意思怎称？请解释。　　
　　　
　　　丁敬平
    丁敬平同志：“天低吴楚”“眼空无物”系借用元朝萨都另作的“念奴娇词”。原词称：“石头城上，望天低吴楚，眼空无物，六朝形胜地，惟有青山如璧”云云；意谓：南京往日的豪华都不见了，惟见，“天低吴楚”而已。楚指江北，吴指江南，吴楚泛指东南。
