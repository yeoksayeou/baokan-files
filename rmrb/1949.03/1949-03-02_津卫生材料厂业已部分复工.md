　　Tianjin Hygiene Material Factory Partially Resumes Production
    [Tianjin Dispatch] The Tianjin Hygiene Material Factory partially resumed production on the 5th. This factory was originally formed by merging the bandage factory, Takeda Pharmaceutical Factory, and machinery repair factory that the Kuomintang took over from Japanese rule. The factory has more than 240 gauze machines, which can produce more than 3,000 bolts of medicated cloth (100 meters per bolt), more than 12,000 jin of absorbent cotton, 3,000 pairs of tweezers, 1,500 pairs of scissors, and 11 tablet-making machines, producing about 10,000 medicated tablets per day. Its products are sold throughout the country. During the Tianjin liberation campaign, the factory workers actively protected the factory. On January 13th, the warehouse was hit by a bullet and caught fire, but it was immediately extinguished by the workers. After the liberation of the city, the factory was taken over by representatives sent by the Military Control Commission, and some machines resumed production on the 5th. Thanks to the active efforts of the employees, its affiliated machinery factory now produces 150 pairs of tweezers and scissors per day, and the pharmaceutical factory has partially started making tablets. The materials factory is mobilizing workers to repair machinery and buildings to actively prepare for resumption of production. More than 200 female child laborers are also dismantling the fortifications built by the Kuomintang bandit army in the factory. Electricians voluntarily gave up their Sunday holiday to refuel and repair machines and circuits. Currently, there are more than 580 workers in each factory. During the Kuomintang rule, the workers of the factory suffered cruel oppression and lived in poverty. The factory not only delayed wages every month, but also exploited the workers in various ways. For example, when the daughter of Zhao Mingchang, the chief of the General Affairs Section of the factory, got married, many workers were forced to deduct 20,000 yuan of bogus currency per person as a gift. Child laborer Li Zhiying said, "I stand and work for eleven hours a day, and I'm exhausted." Wang Da'nv said, "Not only am I tired, but they often press our heads to the ground and beat us!" After bitterly describing the oppression he had suffered in the past, technician Zhu Yongzeng said, "When we heard the artillery fire attacking Tianjin, we were very happy. Now we have the right to speak, and we will no longer be bullied!"
    Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 27th. Publicly run enterprises and factories in Peiping are gradually resuming work and are actively carrying out repair work. After the workers of the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant dug out 2,000 tons of ore to solve the problem of raw materials for heating, they are now actively dismantling and repairing the 250-ton blast furnace closed by the Kuomintang. After the Pingjin Clothing General Factory started work on the 21st of this month, more than 1,300 workers modified more than 16,500 sets of old military uniforms on the first day. The employees of Yanjing Paper Mill and Beiping Woolen Mill are also busy carrying out repairs and will be able to resume work soon.

　　津卫生材料厂业已部分复工
    【天津电】天津卫生材料厂已于五日部分复工。该厂原是国民党接收日本统治时的绷带厂、武田药厂、器械修理厂后合组而成。该厂拥有二百四十余架纱布机，每月可产药布三千多匹（每匹一百公尺），药棉一万二千余斤，镊子三千把，剪子一千五百把，十一架制锭机，日出约一万药锭。其产品供销全国各地。天津解放战役中，该厂工人积极护厂，一月十三日，仓库中弹起火，当即被工人扑灭。本市解放后，该厂为军管会派员接收，至五日即有部分机器复工。由于员工们积极努力，其所属机械工厂已日产镊，剪一百五十把，药品工厂已部分制锭。材料工厂则正发动工人修整机器、房屋积极准备复工。二百余女童工也在动手拆除国民党匪军在厂内所修碉堡工事；电工自动放弃了礼拜休假，加油修理机器、电路。现各厂到有工人五百八十余名。国民党统治时，该厂工人受尽残酷压榨，生活困苦。厂方不但每月拖延工资，还以各种办法剥削工人。如该厂总务科长赵明昌的女儿出嫁，竟强迫扣去许多工人的工资每人伪法币二万元作为送礼费，女童工李芝英说：“一天站着工作十一个钟头，累个要死。”王大女说：“不只累，还经常把头按到地下打我们呢！”技工朱永增在愤恨的说了以前受压迫的情形后说：“听到打天津的大炮响，我们都非常高兴，现在我们有了发言权，再也不受气了！”
    【新华社北平二十七日电】北平公营企业工厂陆续复工中，并积极进行修复工作。石景山钢铁厂的工人在挖出矿石两千吨解决取暖用的原料后，现又积极拆修被国民党封闭的容量二百五十吨的炼铁炉。平津被服总厂于本月二十一日开工后，一千三百多工人第一天即修改好旧存军服一万六千五百余套。燕京造纸厂、北平制呢厂的职工们也正忙着进行修复工作，不日即可复工。
