　　Committing Heinous Crimes Arouses Universal Hatred
　　The Masses Report Special Agent Liu Yunyu
　　[This newspaper reports] Liu Yunyu, the chairman of the "People's Communist Purge Committee" of the pseudo-Eighteenth District of Ping City and concurrently the general captain of the "Communist Purge Vanguard Team" of the pseudo-Eighteenth District, "loyally" engaged in special agent activities for the Kuomintang reactionaries before the liberation of Beiping. On "June 2nd" and "August 19th," he led special agents to surround Tsinghua and Yenching Universities, beat students, and arrested Tsinghua worker Zhang Wenzhi, torturing him to death. He also coerced resident Wu Sima Zi to death. The local students and residents all hated Liu Yunyu to the bone. After the Beiping Municipal People's Government promulgated the special agent registration measures this time, Liu Yunyu not only refused to register, but also said: "Even if the Eighteenth District asks me to do things, I still wouldn't go!" On the afternoon of the 16th, local residents spontaneously reported the special agent. With the government's permission, Liu Yunyu was sent to the Eighteenth Sub-bureau of the Public Security Bureau. On the way, an old man surnamed Zhao encountered them and stopped everyone, asking Liu Yunyu: "You are so cruel. I have four sons, and you forced three of them to become soldiers, ruining my business..." A woman also stepped forward and said: "He grabbed my man to be a soldier and asked me to hand over six sacks of flour. I didn't have flour, so he tied my man up and took him away..." Everyone said: "Hand this bastard over to the People's Government to deal with. Now that the People's Government has come, someone is standing up for us. We want to settle accounts with him." Hundreds of people sent Liu Yunyu to the Eighteenth Sub-bureau, which has accepted the opinions of the people and detained Liu Yunyu for interrogation. (Qinghua Communications Group)

　　为非作歹人人恨
  　群众检举特务刘云裕
    【本报讯】平市伪十八区“民众清共委员会”主任委员兼伪十八区“清共先锋队”总队长刘云裕在北平解放以前，“忠心”为国民党反动派从事特务活动，于“六、二”“八、一九”曾带领特务包围清华燕大两校，殴打学生，并抓走清华工友张文治毒刑拷打，逼死居民吴四麻子，当地学生居民对刘云裕莫不恨之入骨。这一次北平市人民政府颁布特务登记办法后，刘云裕不但不去登记，还说：“十八区请我办事，我还不去呢！”十六日下午，当地居民自动检举特务，经政府允许，将刘云裕送公安局十八分局，在路上，一个姓赵的老头碰见了，便拦住大家，问刘云裕道：“你好狠心，我有四个儿子，你逼走了三个去当兵，把我的买卖都逼垮了……。”一位妇女也走上来说：“他抓我男人当兵，要我交六袋面，我没有面，他便把我男人捆走了，……”大家都说：“把这个混蛋交给人民政府办理去，现在人民政府来了，有人撑我们的腰了，我们要和他算帐。”几百个老百姓把刘云裕送到了十八分局，十八分局已接受老百姓的意见，将刘云裕收押讯办。（清华通讯组）
