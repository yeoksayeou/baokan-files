　　To Guarantee Correct Execution of Laws and Regulations, Determine Review of Criminal Cases
    Notification for Implementation by the North China People's Government
    [Reported by this newspaper] Regarding the criminal case review system, practices varied in different regions in the past, except for cases involving the death penalty. In order to strengthen the connection between the people's courts at all levels in North China, exchange work experience, improve judicial theory, and facilitate the higher-level courts' inspection and supervision of the lower-level courts, and grasp the correct execution of policies and regulations in trials, so that the courts at all levels carefully handle people's lawsuits and handle cases better, the North China People's Government has determined a criminal case review system, and on March 23, issued a notice to unify its implementation in various regions. The system stipulates that cases in which the county and city people's courts sentence imprisonment of less than five years, detention, or fines, if neither the plaintiff nor the defendant appeals, the original trial judgment shall be the final judgment. These judgments should be sent to the provincial or administrative office people's court for review every month. If the provincial or administrative office people's court believes that a case needs to be reviewed during the review, it should immediately transfer the case file for review. The people's courts of each province, administrative office, or directly-administered city should also send the above-mentioned judgments to the North China People's Court for record every month. If the North China People's Court believes that a case needs to be reviewed, it may transfer the case file for review. As for cases involving imprisonment of more than five years, the county and city people's courts should submit them to the provincial or administrative office people's court for review and approval after sentencing. If the original judgment is inappropriate, it may be changed or returned for retrial. As for cases involving the death penalty, they must be sent to the North China People's Court for review, and submitted to the Chairman of the North China People's Government for approval before becoming a final judgment.
    [Another report] The North China People's Government recently stipulated that the judicial committees or adjudication committees in various regions should be uniformly renamed as Adjudication Research Committees. The committee shall be headed by the person in charge of the judicial organ as the director, with the presiding judge, the county magistrate, the director of the public security bureau, and the main persons in charge of the selected mass organizations as members. The members can be fixed, but when the Adjudication Research Committee is convened, members who are not greatly concerned with the case may not participate. The meeting can be held with at least five members present. The tasks of the committee are to study death penalty cases and major criminal cases involving imprisonment of more than five years that have been tried by the judicial organs, and civil cases involving policy principles that need to be carefully considered and decided or requested for instructions (such as the standards and principles of family division and inheritance). For the rest, such as criminal cases involving imprisonment of less than five years, and civil cases where the law has clear provisions or the policy principles are obvious and can be decided without research, the judicial organs shall formulate handling opinions, which shall become the final judgment after being approved by the administrative负责人.

　　保证正确执行法令确定复核刑事案件
    华北人民政府通令执行
    【本报讯】关于刑事案件复核制度，除判处死刑的案件外，过去各地做法不一，华北人民政府为了加强各级人民法院上下级的联系，交流工作经验，提高司法理论，及便利于上级法院检查、监督下级法院与掌握政策法令在审判中的正确执行，使各级法院慎重地处理人民诉讼，把案件办理的更好，因特确定刑事案件复核制度，于三月二十三日通令各地统一执行。该制度规定各县市人民法院判处不满五年的有期徒刑，拘役或罚金的案件，如果原被两造不上诉，原审判决即为确定之判决。这些判决应每月送省或行署人民法院核阅。如省或行署人民法院于核阅中认为某案有复核之必要时，应即调卷复核。各省、行署或直辖市人民法院对上所述之判决亦应每月送华北人民法院备查，华北人民法院认为某案有复核之必要时，得调卷复核。至于五年以上的有期徒刑案件，各县市人民法院判处后应呈送省或行署人民法院复核批准，若原判不当，得行改判，或发还更审。关于判处死刑的案件，须送华北人民法院复核，呈经华北人民政府主席批准，始为确定之判决。
    【又讯】华北人民政府顷规定各地之司法委员会或裁判委员会一律改名为裁判研究委员会，该委员会以司法机关负责人为主任委员，主审员、县长、公安局长及选聘之民众团体主要负责人为委员。委员可以固定，但召开裁判研究委员系时，对于该项案件关会不大的委员可不参加。出席委员已足五人即得开会。该委员会之任务为研究司法机关已经审理后的死刑、及五年以上有期徒刑的重大刑事案件，及有关政策原则需要慎重考虑决定或请示的民事案件（如分家、继承等案的标准原则）。其余如五年以下有期徒刑的刑事案件，及法有明文规定或政策原则显然不待研究即可决定的民事案件，均由司法机关拟具处理意见，经行政负责人核准，即为确定之判决。　　　　（秘书厅叶澜）
