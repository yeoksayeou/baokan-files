　　The Educational Significance of the March 18th Patriotic Movement
　　Zhang Ximan
　　Editor's note: Mr. Zhang Ximan sent in a commemorative article on "March 18th," but it was received late, so it is being published today.

　　Today is the twenty-third anniversary of the "March 18th Massacre."

　　Because the struggle of Chinese youth and workers against British and Japanese imperialism, sparked by the May 30th Massacre in 1925, rapidly and greatly shifted to the struggle to overthrow the feudal warlords—the running dogs of imperialism—the conscious revolutionary movement of the Chinese people seriously alarmed the imperialists who had acquired so-called vested interests in China. They could only actively support their running dogs at any time to suppress and undermine the great liberation movement of the Chinese people.

　　Originally, Feng Yuxiang's "betrayal" in October 1924 during the war between the Feng and Zhili warlords, which dealt a fatal blow to the Zhili clique's Wu Peifu, had its significant historical meaning. However, unfortunately, after welcoming Sun Yat-sen to the north, he suddenly secretly compromised with the Feng clique's warlord Zhang Zuolin, who was stationed in Tianjin, and supported Duan Qirui, the pro-Japanese Anfu clique traitor who had been overthrown after the May Fourth Movement in 1919, to become the interim executive in Beijing. After Sun Yat-sen went north, he not only suffered cold treatment from the traitors Zhang and Duan, but even Feng Yuxiang avoided meeting him. This subtle change caused Sun Yat-sen, who was the hope of the nation at the time, to die of illness in Beijing, causing irreparable losses to the future cooperation between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party (March 12, 1925). Zhang and Duan colluded and relied on Xiao Yaonan, the inspector of Hubei and Hunan (the executioner who massacred the striking workers of the Ping-Han Railway on February 7, 1922), and Wu Peifu, who looked to the imperialists for guidance, launched an attack on the Second National Army led by Feng Yuxiang in Henan from Hubei, forming a united front to eliminate the National Army led by Feng Yuxiang in the north, in order to prevent Feng from supporting and echoing the Northern Expeditionary Army from Guangdong in the future. They raised the banner of "anti-communism" because the Zhili-Lu Allied Army led by Li Jinglin and Zhang Zongchang (see my book "Record of Recruiting Revolutionary Cavalry in 1911"), who were fostered by the Feng clique, suffered a heavy blow from the National Army near Tianjin. Therefore, the shameless Japanese invaders dispatched two warships to Dagukou on March 12, indiscriminately shelling the National Army garrisoned on the shore, attempting to cover the landing of the marines and create a pretext for interfering in China's internal affairs. Indignant, the National Army not only did not succumb to the power of the Japanese invaders, but also returned fire. The next day, the Japanese Minister lodged a protest with the traitorous Duan government, placing the responsibility for firing the first shot on the National Army, and demanding the withdrawal of the National Army and the severe punishment of the culprits. In the midst of this incident, in addition to issuing an ultimatum alone, the Japanese invaders also incited the ministers of seven countries, including Britain, the United States, France, Italy, the Netherlands, Belgium, and Spain, to issue an ultimatum to the Executive Government in the name of eight countries. Based on the humiliating Boxer Protocol (1900), which they had forced on the traitorous Qing government after the Boxer Rebellion, they demanded the cessation of military actions between Tianjin and Dagukou to ensure the freedom of entry and exit for imperialist officials and businessmen on this transportation artery; and gave a deadline of forty-four hours to give a satisfactory reply, otherwise the "naval authorities of the relevant countries" stationed in the Far East would "decide to take the necessary measures" and prepare to stage a new "Eight-Nation Alliance" again. This barbaric attitude and action of the imperialists really damaged the personality and self-esteem of the vast Chinese people. First of all, representatives of various groups in Beijing jointly petitioned the Executive Government on March 17, hoping that it would sternly refute the ultimatums of the eight countries and the Japanese invaders. Because the Executive Government, formed by the conspiracy of the traitors Duan, Zhang, and Wu, did not dare to offend the imperialists and was unwilling to accept the legitimate demands of the people, it incited the guards to stab several petition representatives. When various people's organizations in Beijing learned of the news that the representatives had been injured, they held meetings all night and decided to hold a mass rally in Tiananmen Square at eight o'clock the next morning, and then collectively proceed to petition the Executive Government, determined not to stop until their goal was achieved. Although there were some minor disputes over the content of the slogans to be put forward in the mass rally and petition procession in Tiananmen Square the next day (such as Wu Zhihui, Zhu Jiahua, and others advocating "do not be too radical"), the majority finally decided on slogans such as "Down with imperialism!" "Down with Duan Qirui!" "Expel the ministers of the eight countries!" The weather on March 18th was very good. Before eight o'clock in the morning, many people gathered from all directions with patriotic enthusiasm. After announcing the recent crimes of imperialism and their loyal running dogs Duan Qirui and others on the rostrum of the Tiananmen Square mass rally, more than 5,000 workers, college students, and middle school students unfurled the above-mentioned slogans and shouted uncompromising slogans, and marched together to the Ministry of the Navy (the location of the Executive Government at the time) in Tieshizi Hutong, Dongxi Pailou to petition. By the time we reached the vicinity of the Executive Government, the traffic around Dongsi Pailou had been blocked because of the participation of the people along the way. We squeezed to the iron gate of the east yamen of the Ministry of the Navy. No matter what, we could not squeeze in, because the inside and outside of the east and west yamen, especially the avenue facing the main gate of the Executive Government, were crowded with patriotic people. As time dragged on to around eleven o'clock, no one from the Executive Government came out to pay attention, no matter how the people petitioned. The petitioning people became very indignant, so they shouted: "Down with Duan Qirui!" "Down with imperialism!" "Expel the ministers of the eight countries!"... In an instant, we heard continuous bursts of gunfire. The guards of the Executive Government had received the order from the traitor Duan and began the bestial massacre of the petitioning patriotic people. In addition, a large number of military police were transferred to disperse the people inside and outside the yamen. This time, twenty-six people were shot dead on the spot. All of the more than two hundred injured people were rescued by our people one by one and sent to various hospitals. Some public and private hospitals even refused to accept them. Because we did not expect the traitors to dare to resort to such a vicious trick beforehand, we had no planned consideration for temporary rescue work. Some seriously injured martyrs died because of excessive blood loss and improper bandaging just after being sent to the hospital. We turned back to look after the dead martyrs, but we did not expect that they had all been temporarily coffined by the Executive Government, and the blood stains on the ground had also been cleaned up. By taking this step, the traitors Duan Qirui and others probably wanted to cover up their brutality, but compared to the brutality of Chiang Kai-shek, who ordered the Gui clique's Hu Zongduo and Tao Jun (commander and deputy commander of the Wuhan garrison) to massacre young people in December 1927 and expose their bodies naked for three days, it seems to be much more clever.

　　This is my very painful historical recollection of the "March 18th Massacre."

　　“三一八”爱国运动的教育意义
    张西曼
    张西曼先生寄来纪念“三一八”一文，因收到较迟，故今天才发表。
    　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　编者
    今天是“三一八惨案”的二十三周年。
    由于民国十四年五卅惨案所激起的中国青年和工人群众反对英日帝国主义的斗争，急遽而大的转变到打倒封建军阀——帝国主义的走狗——的斗争，所以中国人民自觉的革命运动，严重的引起了在华获有所谓既得权利的帝国主义者的非常恐慌，它们只有随时积极的支援它们的走狗们来镇压、破坏中国民众的伟大解放运动。
    本来冯玉祥于民国十三年十月在奉直军阀作战中，毅然举行了对直系吴佩孚致命打击的“倒戈”，是有它的重大历史意义的但是不幸他在欢迎孙中山北上之后，忽又和进驻天津的奉系军阀张作霖秘密妥协，拥戴那民八“五四运动”后被打倒的亲日安福系国贼段祺瑞入北京做临时执政。孙中山北上以后，不但受尽张段诸贼的冷遇，同时连冯玉祥也避不见面。这种微妙的变化，使一时系全国物望的孙中山气死于北京，造成了以后国共合作上不可补偿的损失（民国十四年三月十二日）。而张段反勾结退依两湖巡阅使萧耀南（即民国十一年二月七日屠杀平汉路罢工工人的刽子手）的吴佩孚、仰承帝国主义者的鼻息，由湖北向河南国民第二军进攻，构成一种消灭北方冯玉祥所领导的国民军的联合阵线，以阻绝冯对将来广东北阀军的声援呼应。他们高举“反赤”的旗帜，就因为奉系所豢养的李景林、张宗昌（见鄙著“辛亥招募革命骑兵记”）统率的直鲁联军在天津附近遭受了国民军的重创，于是无耻的日寇于三月十二日派出两只军舰驶入大沽口，向岸上驻防的国民军守军横施炮击，企图掩护陆战队的登陆，造成干涉中国内政的把柄。激于义愤的国民军不但不为日寇威力所慑伏，而且也开炮还击。第二天，日本公使就向卖国的段政府提出抗议，把首先开炮的责任强加在国民军身上，连带要求撤退国民军和严惩祸首。在这次事变的中间，日寇除单独提出最后通牒外，同时又煽动英、美、法、意、荷、比、西七国公使以八国的名义致最后通牒于执政府。他们根据庚子义和团事变后（一九○○）压迫满清国贼所承受的屈辱万倍的辛丑和约，要求停止天津大沽间的军事行动，以保障帝国主义者官商在此交通要道上出入的自由；并且限四十四小时内圆满答复，否则驻泊远东的“各关系国海军当局决定采取认为必要的手段”准备再来导演一次新的“八国联军”。这种帝国主义的野蛮态度和行动，实在损伤了中国广大民众的人格和自尊心。首先就由当时北京方面的各团体代表于三月十七日联合向执政府请愿，希望它严词驳斥八国以及日寇的最后通牒。由于卖国贼段、张、吴阴谋构成的执政府不敢开罪帝国主义和不愿接受民众的合理要求，于是嗾使卫队刺伤了请愿代表多人。北京各民众团体得知代表们受伤的消息，露夜开会，决定于明早八时在天安门召开民众大会，然后再集体出发到执政府请愿，抱定了不达目的誓不中止的决心。在第二天民众大会和请愿行列中应提出的标语口号的内容上，虽然发生了一些小小的争论（如吴稚晖、朱家骅等主张“不要过激”），最后还是大多数决定了“打倒帝国主义！”“打倒段祺瑞！”“驱逐八国公使！”等口号。三月十八日的天气很好，早八时以前就有许多人抱着救国的热情，自各方来集合。在天安门民众大会讲演台上宣布了帝国主义和他们忠实走狗段祺瑞等的最近罪行后，顿时有五千余的工人、大中学生等展开上述的标语，喊着不妥协的口号，一齐向东西牌楼铁狮子胡同海军部（当时执政府所在地）去请愿。等到我们走到执政府附近的时候，因为沿途民众的纷纷参加，已经把东四牌楼一带的交通阻塞住了。我们挤到海军部东辕门的铁栅栏口，无论如何，总是挤不进去，因为东西辕门的里里外外，尤其对着执政府严加戒备的正门前面的大道上，都挤满了爱国的民众。时间拖到十一时左右，无论民众如何的请求，执政府方面绝没有一人出来理会。请愿的民众非常激愤起来，于是高喊：“打倒段祺瑞！”“打倒帝国主义！”“驱逐八国公使！”……霎时间，听到排枪不断的响，执政府的卫队已经得到段贼的命令向请愿的爱国民众开始兽性的屠杀了。另外调出大批军警赶来打散辕门内外的民众。这次，当场被枪杀的二十六人。所有受伤的二百多人，都由我们民众一一抢救出来，送往各处医院，有些公私医院甚至拒绝接受。因为我们事先毫未料到卖国贼们敢于下此毒手，所以毫未有计划的顾到临时的救护工作。有些受重伤的烈士们，因为流血过多，包扎不得法，刚刚送到医院就又死掉二三十人。我们再回头来照看那些已死的烈士们，那晓得都被执政府拿薄棺材临时装殓了，地上的血迹也被打扫一空。段祺瑞等卖国贼来此一着，大概是要掩饰他们的残暴性，可是比起民国十六年十二月蒋贼介石命令桂系胡宗铎、陶钧（武汉警备正副司令）屠杀青年后裸体暴尸三日的残暴性似乎真要高明多了。
    这是我对“三一八惨案”非常惨痛的历史回忆。
