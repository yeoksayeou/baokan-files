　　Overcoming the Practice of Indiscriminate Seed Loans
    ……Experiences Gained in Xian County and Other Places
    [JiZhong News] The seed shortage in the JiZhong waterlogged areas during wheat planting has been completely resolved. Xian County's promotion association distributed 26,000 jin of seeds, Wen'an distributed more than 8,800 jin, and Gaoyang loaned out seeds sufficient to sow more than 1,500 mu, solving the difficulties of impoverished and helpless families of revolutionary martyrs and farmers. The Wenxin County Promotion Association once purchased 70,000 jin of rice from the masses and exchanged it for wheat seeds from Xiong County. Xian County transferred cadres from various departments to organize a shock wheat planting work team, going to the countryside to mobilize disaster victims to plant wheat. They accepted the lessons of indiscriminate lending in the past seed loans. County cadres, in coordination with village cadres, first went to the villages to review the households in need of seed loans and the amounts needed. After registration, the loans were issued on a village basis, and the village cooperatives or village governments were responsible for safekeeping and distribution. Some villages distributed the seeds on the day of sowing, distributing enough for each plot of land, so that the seeds were truly loaned to the impoverished families of revolutionary martyrs and workers, and disaster victims unable to purchase seeds. During the distribution in Wen'an, honest and impartial old farmers with prestige among the masses were invited to convene a meeting of seed loan households. At the meeting, self-reporting and public discussion were conducted, and the seeds were distributed appropriately according to need. In Gaoyang, after educating the disaster victims who received seed loans and raising their ideological awareness, a contract system was implemented. This not only guaranteed the use of the seeds but also corrected the erroneous idea of "borrowing without repaying" that existed in the past.

　　克服滥贷种籽作法
    ……献县等地获经验
    【冀中讯】冀中水灾区种麦中的种籽困难，得到完满解决。献县推进社发放种籽两万六千斤，文安发放八千八百余斤，高阳贷出可播种一千五百余亩的籽种，解决了贫困无力的烈军属及农民的困难。文新县推进社曾收买了群众稻米七万斤，从雄县换回麦种。献县从各部门抽调干部组织了突击种麦工作组，下乡发动灾民进行种麦。他们接受了过去贷种中滥贷的教训，县干部协同村干部，到村首先进行审查需要贷种户和数量，登记后，以村为单位贷出，再由村合作社或村公所负责保管发放。有的村是那天播种就那天发给，种一块地发一块地的，使种籽真正贷给了贫困的烈军工属及无力购买种籽的灾民。文安发放中，聘请了公正忠实在群众中有威望的老农，召开贷种户会，会上进行自报公议，按需要适当发放。高阳对贷种的灾民进行教育中，提高其思想认识后，实行了订立合同的办法。这样即保证了用途，又纠正了过去存在的“光贷不还”的错误思想。
