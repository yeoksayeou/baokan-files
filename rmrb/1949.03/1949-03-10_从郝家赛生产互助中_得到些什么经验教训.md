　　What Experiences and Lessons Have Been Learned from Haojia Sai's Production Mutual Aid?
    Neiqiu County Cooperation Section
    Haojia Sai in the Third District of Neiqiu County is a relatively wealthy village, with a total of sixty-six households. The village's mutual aid group was organized in 1943 during the hoeing of spring seedlings, under the leadership of Hao Chunguang. In the fifth lunar month, the wheat seedlings should have been hoed long ago, but the enemy was constantly suppressing and looting, causing the masses to be afraid to hoe the seedlings. Hao Chunguang, having returned from training, encountered this situation. He immediately grabbed Hao Zengfu and Hao Fusheng, two activists, to carry out activities. After they agreed, Hao Chunguang, as the group leader, began mutual aid. The southern hill of the village was the enemy's stronghold, and they would come to Haojia Sai once a day, grabbing people whenever they saw them. In this situation, they adopted the strategy of going to the north of the village to hoe in the morning and going to the south of the village in the afternoon, with the elderly and children of the family acting as sentries. In this way, the seedlings were hoed, and they also avoided being captured by the enemy. When the masses saw their activities, some people asked to work with them. The three of them discussed it and each absorbed two more households, totaling nine households. They were divided into three groups, with the original three serving as group leaders. When there was a lot of work, they worked together; when there was less work, they divided into groups. When the wheat harvest began, it developed to eighteen households. It played a significant role in the wheat harvest. The mutual aid group completed its own wheat harvest in a timely manner and also contracted to harvest wheat for many households. This continued until after the autumn harvest, when it was disbanded. Because the masses saw the benefits of mutual aid, by the spring of the following year, they automatically requested to carry manure together when spring manuring began. Still based on the original group leaders, with the truly voluntary participation of more than twenty households, they formed small groups of three to five households based on land proximity – generally still considered three large groups – with Hao Chunguang as the overall group leader. After discussing with everyone, they established methods such as recording work and time, as well as a meeting system. Regardless of the group, they all evaluated labor at night every day, recording it daily and settling accounts every ten days. A full labor force was defined as ten points per day, regardless of whether it was a male or female. Half labor forces were recorded according to the work done and points assigned accordingly. By July, it had developed to forty households, divided into six groups. Because of the organization, the difficulties of labor and livestock were overcome. In the third year (1945), after the enemy left, except for the households of the elderly, widowed, and those lacking labor, everyone participated. At this time, Hao Chunguang learned from the method of Shentou Village and formed a work allocation team, divided into two platoons. They formally elected team leaders, platoon leaders, and other cadres, and forcibly assigned the ten or so households of the elderly, widowed, and those lacking labor who had not participated in the mutual aid group to various mutual aid groups. At this time, the masses had opinions but dared not express them openly. The masses reflected, saying, "Our village was previously a mutual aid group, but now it has become a confused group." After Hao Chunguang was transferred to the work team, the chairman of the farmers' association, Hao Erxiao, subjectively canceled the two platoon leaders. From then on, the mutual aid groups gradually collapsed. In the spring of 1946, there was a renewed call for voluntary association, forming six groups. They still forcibly assigned the elderly and widowed households to each group and proposed that everything should be done first by the poor peasants. In 1948, for the convenience of holding meetings and compiling materials, they were reorganized into five large groups. In name, the entire village was organized, but in reality, it was a formality. In addition, besides production, other village matters, such as discussing various figures and allocating land for cultivation on behalf of others, were all handled through the mutual aid group. This made the masses think that "getting organized" was a "public matter" and a burden.

    What Experiences and Lessons Have Been Learned?

    1.  From the past and present situation of the village's mutual aid group, it can be vividly seen that failing to study the production characteristics of the peasants, starting from the actual local situation, and mechanically copying the experiences of other villages in a subjectivist manner, and pursuing formalistic figures, is harmful to production mutual aid. Forcibly having the masses take care of the elderly and widowed without compensation affected the labor enthusiasm of the masses, who believed that "organizing mutual aid production" was a burden, forming an important reason for the collapse of the mutual aid group. This is mainly because the purpose of organizing production mutual aid was not clear, and there was a lack of understanding that organizing was for the purpose of developing production, and everything should start from stimulating and improving productive forces. That is to say, organizing mutual aid must be based on the principle of "voluntary and mutually beneficial." If the mutual aid group is not based on the principles of voluntariness and equivalent exchange, then the more it is organized, the worse it becomes. The larger the organization, the more problems there are. The longer it is maintained without disbanding, the more it becomes detached from the masses.

    2.  Mobilizing female labor to participate in agricultural production must have a reasonable work evaluation system. For example, generally regarding women as half a labor force across the board is a blow to the production enthusiasm of female labor. The village's mutual aid group, in its work evaluation, used a method of recording work and assigning points, which played a positive role in encouraging women to participate in production.

    3.  In the future, to develop production mutual aid, first of all, we should widely publicize the mutual aid policy. The mutual aid groups that were organized by open coercion can be freely disbanded and freely reorganized. For the past coercive and commandist work style, cadres can make public self-criticisms and guide the masses to analyze what was right and what was wrong from studying the historical examples of mutual aid groups in their own villages, recognize the benefits of mutual aid production, and clarify the mutual aid policy, in order to improve cadres and the masses. At the same time, the problems left over from the past mutual aid groups (such as taking care of the elderly and widowed without compensation) should also be promptly resolved and dealt with, which will encourage the mood of peasants' mutual aid production.

　　从郝家赛生产互助中
  　得到些什么经验教训
    内邱县合作科
    内邱三区郝家赛是一个比较富裕的村子，全村共有六十六户人家。该村互助组是一九四三年锄春苗时，在郝春光领导下组织起来的。阴历五月初麦苗早该锄了，但敌人一天天在清剿抢掠，闹的群众不敢锄苗。郝春光从训练班受训回来，正遇这情况，他即抓住了郝增福、郝福生两个积极分子进行活动，他俩同意后，由郝春光任组长，即开始互助起来。该村南岗就是敌人的据点，每天要到郝家赛一次，见人就抓，在这种情况下，他们就采取了早晨午前去村北锄，午后即到村南锄，并带有家里老头小孩放哨站岗，就这样苗也锄了，也躲避了敌人的抓夫。群众看到他们这种活动以后，有人要求和他们一块干活，他们三人商量了一下，每人又吸收了两户，共有九户，就分成了三个小组，原来的三人为组长，活多就在一块，活少就分为小组活动。麦收一开始就发展十八户。在麦收中起到很大作用，互助组及时完成了自己的麦收，又包收了不少户的麦收。就这样贯彻到秋后才解散了。因群众看到互助好处，到第二年春天，春天挑粪开始，就自动要求伙担。还是以原来的组长为基础，在真正自觉自愿条件下，参加了二十多户，以地片地邻结成三五户不等的小组——总的还算三个大组——郝春光为总组长。又经过和大家商量，建立了记工记时等办法和会议制度。不管哪组都是每天黑了，评议劳力，一天一记，十天算一回帐。劳力规定的是一个整劳力一天十分，不论男女整半劳力，都是按活记工，按工记分。到了七月就发展到四十户，分成了六个小组，由于组织起来，克服了当时劳畜力的困难。到第三年（一九四五年）敌人走后，除了孤寡无劳力户，全部都参加了。这时郝春光学习了神头村的办法，编成了拨工队，下分两个排。形式的选举了拨工队长、排长等干部，又把未参加互助的十来户孤寡无劳力户，强制分配到各互助组里。这时群众都有意见，却不敢公开提。群众反映说：“咱村先前是互助组，现在成糊涂组了。”郝春光调到工作队以后，农会主席郝二小，又主观的取消了两个排长，从此互助小组也渐渐垮台了。到一九四六年春天，又重新号召自愿结合，结合成六个小组。仍强制的把孤寡户分配到各小组，并提出了一切都先由贫农做。到一九四八年为了开会和统计材料方便，又编成了五个大组，名义上是全村都组织起来了，实际上是一种形式。另外，除生产外，村里的其他人如讨论各种数字，分配代耕等都通过互助组，这样使群众认为“组织起来”是一种“公事”与负担。
    得到些什么经验教训？
    一、从该村互助组今昔情况中，可活生生地看出不研究农民生产特点，从当地实际情况出发；主观主义的硬搬外村经验，和追求形式的数目字，对于生产互助的危害。再强制群众无代价的照顾孤寡，影响了群众的劳动情绪，认为“互助生产组织起来”，是一种负担，形成互助组垮台的一个重要原因。这主要是组织生产互助的目的不明确，不了解组织起来是为了发展生产，一切应从刺激与提高生产力出发，也就是说组织互助必须是建立在“自愿两利”的基础上，互助组如果不是根据自愿和等价的原则，那就越组织的多越坏，组织越大越问题多，越维持的年代长而不散，就越脱离群众。
    二、发动妇女劳力参加农业生产，必须有合理的评工制度，如笼统的把妇女一律当半劳力看，就是打击妇女劳力的生产积极性，该村互助组在评工上，是以活记工订分，这对鼓励妇女参加生产，起到积极的推动作用。
    三、今后发展生产互助，首先应广泛的宣传互助政策，公开强制组织的互助组，可自由解散重新自由结合，对于过去的强制命令作风，干部可作公开检讨；并引导群众从研究本村互助组的历史实例中，分析哪些是对的，哪些是错了，认清互助生产的好处，明确互助政策，以提高干部与群众。同时过去互助组遗留的问题（比如无代价照顾孤寡等）也应及时加以解决处理，会鼓励农民互助生产的情绪。
