　　Relying on Basic Masses, Strictly Guarding Against Bad Elements Stirring Up Trouble
    Jizhong Fifth Sub-district Gains Experience in New District Work
    The Jizhong Fifth Sub-district has gained preliminary experience in opening up new districts: ① Because the village cadres in the new districts have relatively low policy understanding and work ability, it is necessary to strengthen their learning and organizational leadership, establish strict meeting and reporting systems, and promptly discover deviations in grassroots work and correct them in a timely manner. ② It is necessary to clearly rely on the basic masses. In Daxing, an error occurred in the work of collecting enemy weapons by leaving the masses and simply using personnel from the puppet organizations. In the eighth district government of the county, several puppet personnel came to mingle almost every day, making it difficult for the masses to approach the people's government for a time. Later, this error was corrected, the personnel of the puppet organization were properly handled, and the work was promoted by relying on the basic masses. In twenty days, more than forty guns and a large number of enemy and puppet materials were seized. ③ When destroying the enemy and puppet organizations and establishing the people's government, it is necessary to strictly guard against bad elements taking advantage of loopholes. When the Third District Committee of Rongcheng convened a meeting of peasant representatives to study mobilizing the masses and establishing the people's power, Liu Huairong, the puppet Bao chief of Langfang, found out about it. He immediately organized a group of bad people in his village and established a so-called "Peasant Association." He cancelled the title of puppet Bao chief, called himself "Village Chief," and let a rich peasant be the Grain Management Director, telling the government that they were elected by the people. Therefore, it is necessary to enlighten the masses to be vigilant against the tricks of enemy, puppet reactionary elements and feudal forces to steal the sky and change the day. Mobilize the masses to completely isolate the reactionary elements. ④ After the basic masses have mastered the political power, it is necessary to quickly establish a militia force to prevent sabotage activities by bandits and special agents. As soon as the First District of Anci established a political power in the village, it also established an armed organization. Therefore, when three special agents came to Xixiaohan Village on the evening of the thirteenth day of the lunar new year, they were driven away by the joint defense militia, which boosted the morale of the masses and strengthened the working spirit of the new cadres. ⑤ County and district cadres should not live in landlords' homes, otherwise they will become divorced from the masses.

　　依靠基本群众  严防坏人捣鬼
    冀中五分区新区工作获经验
    冀中五分区在开辟新区工作中获得了初步经验：①新区村干部因为政策水平与工作能力都比较低，所以必须加强其学习和组织领导，建立严格的会议和汇报制度，及时发现下层工作中的偏差，及时给以纠正。②必须明确依靠基本群众。大兴在收缴敌人武器工作中，曾发生了离开群众，单纯利用伪组织人员的错误。该县八区区政府里，差不多每天都有几个伪人员来打混，使群众一时不敢与人民政府接近。后来纠正了这种错误，正确处理了伪组织人员，依靠基本群众推动工作，在二十天中，收缴了四十多枝枪和大批敌伪物资。③在摧毁敌伪组织，建立人民政府时，要严防坏分子钻空子。容城三区区委召集农民代表会研究发动群众、建立人民政权时，被廊坊伪保长刘怀荣探悉，他马上在他村组织了一帮坏人，成立了所谓“农会”。他把伪保长的名义取消，称为“村长”，并让一个富农当粮管主任，告政府说是民选的。因此必须启发群众警惕敌伪反动分子和封建势力偷天换日的诡计。发动群众，使反动分子完全孤立起来。④基本群众掌握政权后，要迅速建立民兵武装，防止匪特的破坏活动。安次一区在村建立起政权，就同时建立起武装组织，所以在旧历正月十三日晚上三个特务到西小韩村活动时，被联防民兵打跑，鼓舞了群众情绪，坚定了新干部的工作情心。⑤县区干部不要借住在地主家里，否则即会脱离群众。
