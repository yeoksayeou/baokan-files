　　Fadeyev—Fadeyev is one of the most outstanding writers of modern socialist Soviet novels. He was born in 1901 to a peasant family in Tver Province. His childhood was spent in the South Ussuri region, and he attended commercial school in Vladivostok. He joined the Communist Party in 1918 and was once a heroic guerrilla fighter who defeated the White Army and resisted Japanese aggression. From 1923 to 1936, he wrote revolutionary novels such as "The Rout," "The Nineteen," and "The Last of the Udege"; during the anti-Nazi Patriotic War, in addition to writing many dispatches for newspapers, he also published the famous "The Young Guard," which won the Stalin Prize. However, he was not complacent because of this. When his "The Young Guard" was criticized (the leading role of the Bolshevik Party in the anti-Nazi Patriotic War was not clearly reflected in the novel), he sincerely accepted the criticism and expressed his intention to faithfully rewrite the novel. In August 1948, he represented Soviet cultural workers at the World Congress of Intellectuals in Defense of Peace held in Poland and was elected as one of the international liaison members of the congress.
　　Franco Spain—Franco was the leader of the Spanish fascist organization "Falange." He launched a counter-revolutionary coup on July 19, 1936, and seized power with the open or tacit support of imperialists such as Germany, Italy, the United States, Britain, and France. On August 10, 1939, he declared himself the "Head of State" of Spain and implemented fascist rule. During World War II, Franco was always one of the vassals of the fascist aggressive bloc. After the war, world democratic public opinion unanimously called for the overthrow of Franco and the restoration of democratic politics in Spain. However, because American and British imperialism adopted a policy of condoning fascism after the war, the Franco regime intensified its various counter-revolutionary activities. Today, with American imperialism openly carrying out military expansion, this fascist regime has become America's "darling."

    法捷也夫——法捷也夫，是现代社会主义苏联长篇小说的最优秀作家之一。一九○一年生于特维尔省的农家。童年住在南乌苏里边疆并在海参崴进过商业学校。一九一八年加入共产党，曾经是打败白军和抵抗日本侵略的英勇游击队员。一九二三年至一九三六年他写出了“洪流”，“十九人”，“鸟捷格的最后”等革命的长篇小说；这次反纳粹爱国自卫战争中，他除给各报纸写了许多通讯以外，又出版了名著“青年近卫军”，荣获了斯大林奖金。但他并不因此自满，当他的“青年近卫军”受到批评时（布尔塞维克党在这次反纳粹爱国自卫战争中的领导作用，在小说中体现不够明确），他诚挚的接受了批评，并表示要忠诚地改写这部小说。一九四八年八月，他代表苏联文化工作者出席在波兰举行的世界文化工作者保卫和平大会，并当选为该会的国际联络委员之一。
    法朗哥西班牙——法朗哥是西班牙法西斯组织“长枪会”的首领，于一九三六年七月十九日发动反革命政变，受到德意美英法等帝国主义的公开的或暗中的支持而夺得政权，一九三九年八月十日，他宣布自任西班牙“元首”，实行法西斯统治。第二次世界大战中，法郎哥一直是法西斯侵略集团的附庸之一，大战以后世界民主舆论曾一致呼吁打倒法朗哥，恢复西班牙的民主政治，但因为美英帝国主义在战后采取着纵容法西斯政策，所以法朗哥政权更变本加厉的作各种反革命活动。在美帝国主义公然实行军事扩张的今天，这个法西斯政权更成了美国的“宝贝”。
