　　Tangshan Steel Plant and Steel Casting Group
    Output Increased Two and a Half Times
  　Workers' Morale Improved, and Living Standards Initially Improved
    [Tangshan Electric Dispatch] The steel ingot and steel casting group output of the state-owned Tangshan Steel Plant's steelmaking workshop reached 196 tons in February, which is 2.7 times the 72 tons produced in December at the time of initial liberation. This has reached the average pre-liberation output (according to 1937, the year with the plant's highest output, steel production in January reached 237 tons, the highest record for the year, with an average monthly output of 167 tons). The main reason for the gradual increase in output is the result of the concerted efforts of the workers and the increase in their work morale. The steel furnace workers are working very hard, and they are eager to produce more steel from each furnace bottom. When 40 furnaces have been produced, the furnace bottom, furnace lining, and furnace roof are almost eroded, but they still support the smelting of three more furnaces. In the past, five engineers took turns on duty, but now it has been reduced to three. The number of odd-job workers carrying slag has been reduced from seven to six. Yao Yugang, the foreman of the dolomite furnace, encouraged his colleagues to strive for economy and speed up their work. The workers who sorted scrap steel carefully picked out many reusable screws from the scrap steel. Engineer Xiao Laichao worked with the workers to load materials and rake slag, and carefully explained the principles of steelmaking operation to the workers when he had time. The workers of the steel plant are working together and are determined to run their plant well, and to manufacture more, better quality, and lower cost products.
    In addition: The output of the publicly-owned Tangshan Cotton Ginning Factory has increased sharply. Each machine can now gin an average of 356 jin of cotton per day, which is about double the 150 to 180 jin ginned per machine per day during the rule of the Kuomintang bandits. The factory was originally the pseudo "China Vegetable Oil Factory." After liberation, it was taken over by the democratic government and renamed. It has 15 cotton ginning machines and 27 female workers. During the rule of the Kuomintang bandits, the wages of the female workers were extremely low, only two jin of corn per person per day. Now, each person works nine hours a day and receives six jin of corn. Because production exceeds the standard, wages are calculated progressively according to the amount of production, and each person actually earns about eight to nine jin of corn per day, and living standards have initially improved.

　　唐山制钢厂与铸钢组
    产量提高两倍半
  　职工情绪提高生活初步改善
    【唐山电】国营唐山制钢厂炼钢工场二月份钢锭与铸钢组产量达一百九十六吨，为初解放时十二月份七十二吨的二点七倍，已达到解放前的平均产量（按三十七年为该厂产量最高的一年，一月份产钢达二百三十七吨，为全年最高记录，平均月产一百六十七吨）。产量逐渐增加的主要原因是由于职工通力合作，工作情绪提高。炼钢炉工人干活很起劲，他们热切希望每一次炉底能多出几炉钢，当出到四十炉的时候、炉底、炉焙、炉顶已经蚀得差不多了，但他们还是支持着多炼了三炉。过去工程师五人轮流值班，现在减至三人。抬渣的杂工从七人减至六人。烧白云石炉的领班姚玉刚鼓励同伴力求节约加紧干活。整理废钢的工人，从废钢中仔细检出很多还能用的螺丝钉来。工程师萧来潮工作的时候和工人一道装料、耙渣，有空便仔细的给工人讲解炼钢操作的道理。制钢厂的职工们在共同努力，决心要把自己的厂搞好，要制造量更多质更好成本更低的产品。
    又讯：公营唐山轧花厂产量激增，每台机车每日平均可轧花三百五十六斤，较国民党匪帮统治时每台每日轧花一百五十斤至一百八十斤约增产一倍。该厂原为伪“中国植物油料厂”，解放后经民主政府接收始更换今名，有轧花机十五台，女工二十七人，国民党匪帮统治时，女工工资极低，每人每日不过二斤玉米，现在每人每日工作九小时，得玉米六斤，因生产超过标准，按生产多少累进计资，每人每日实得工资都在八斤至九斤玉米左右，生活初步改善。
