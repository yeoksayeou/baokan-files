【Taiyuan Electric】The Jinzhong Branch of the People's Bank of China is strictly examining the right-leaning errors in the urban lending work of the Yuci Sub-branch. This inspection began on the 5th of this month and was summarized on the 13th. Comrade Zhou Yizhong, the manager of the branch, personally participated. The summary pointed out that the reasons for the errors of not distinguishing between industry and commerce, and not distinguishing between public and private (see this newspaper on the 20th), were primarily due to unclear policy viewpoints and a lack of understanding of the role and tasks that the National Bank should play in the financial market. Secondly, they did not know how to flexibly apply policies in conjunction with specific circumstances. According to December of last year to January of this year, it was the end of the year, and a large number of goods were concentrated for consumption in the city, and prices were rising. At that time, the branch instructed to stop issuing loans and tighten the currency; however, the sub-branch was afraid of accumulating too much inventory and losing money. Last December, the branch decided to uniformly allocate inventory, and the sub-branch was again afraid that inter-bank borrowing would have small profits. Supported by narrow departmentalism and a one-sided view of preserving capital and making profits, it still issued a large number of loans and released inventory, attempting to reduce interest losses, which further fueled price increases and devalued the currency. Thirdly, the bureaucratic style of not investigating beforehand, not checking afterwards, and not correcting problems when they were discovered made the errors even more developed.
    In order to correct the errors and improve the work, the summary finally proposed: (1) Strengthen the policy study of cadres and improve their policy level and technical ability. (2) Overcome unorganized and undisciplined free actions, adhere to the implementation of the instructions and decisions of superiors, and diligently request instructions and report frequently. (3) Strengthen investigation and research work, it is necessary to understand the credit and business situation of each loan client and the purpose of the loan, and conduct inspections at any time. If problems are found, they must be corrected quickly, and crude and careless bureaucracy should be opposed. (4) Establish an overall concept, overcome the narrow view of preserving capital and making profits, give play to the leading role of the National Bank in the New Democratic economic construction, cooperate with various state-owned enterprises and public-owned stores, strengthen the leadership and management of the market finance, and achieve the general purpose of developing production and prospering the economy. (5) Strengthen the leadership of the branch. The branch will regularly check the work of the sub-branch, and participate in the summary and deployment work meetings of the sub-branch at the end and beginning of each month to help the sub-branch work in a systematic and planned manner.

　　克服片面保本观点
    深入了解贷户情况
    晋中分行纠正榆次贷款错误
    【太原电】中国人民银行晋中分行严格检查榆次支行城市放款工作中的右倾错误。此项检查于本月五日开始，十三日已做出总结。分行经理周义中同志亲自参加。总结指出形成工商不分、公私不分（见二十日本报）错误的原因，首先是由于政策观点不明确，不了解国家银行对金融市场应起的作用和任务。其次，不会把政策与具体情况结合灵活运用。按去年十二月至今年一月，正是年关，大批货物在城市集中消费，物价上涨，当时分行曾指示停止发放贷款，紧缩货币；但支行怕库存多积压赔钱。去年十二月分行决定统一调拨库存，支行又怕联行用款利小。在狭隘的本位思想、片面保本赢利观点支持下，仍然大量发放，推出库存，企图减少利息的赔累，结果更助长了物价上涨，使货币贬值。再次，事前不调查，事后不检查，发现问题不纠正的官僚主义作风，使错误愈加发展。
    为了纠正错误，改进工作，总结最后提出：（一）要加强干部的政策学习，提高干部的政策水平与技术能力。（二）克服无组织无纪律的自由行动，坚持执行上级的指示、决定，勤请示，勤报告。（三）加强调查研究工作，必须了解每个贷款户的信用与业务情况及贷款用途，随时进行检查，发现问题要迅速纠正，反对粗枝大叶官僚主义。（四）建立整体观念，克服狭隘的保本赢利观点，发挥国家银行在新民主主义经济建设中的领导作用，配合各国营企业，公营商店，加强对市场金融的领导和管理，达到发展生产，繁荣经济的总目的。（五）加强分行的领导。分行将定期检查支行工作，在每月终与每月初，参加支行总结与布置工作的会议，达到有系统有计划的帮助支行工作。
