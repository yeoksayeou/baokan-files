　　Plants Also Need to Breathe Oxygen
　　To the Editor:
　　I usually understand the relationship between air and living things as follows: animals breathe in oxygen and exhale carbon dioxide, while plants absorb carbon dioxide and release oxygen. However, the end of the fourth lesson, "The Composition of Air and Its Relationship to Living Things," in the second volume of elementary school natural science states: "Plants cannot grow without air because they need to absorb carbon dioxide and oxygen from the air to grow." If this is the case, what gas do plants exhale? Is this a new theory? Or is there an error in the book? Please advise.

Qiao Ru:

　　The statement in the book is not wrong, and it is not a new theory either.
　　Regarding the respiration of plants, it is important to understand "the function of plant leaves." According to scientific experiments, we know that plant leaves contain chlorophyll. Through the small pores on the leaves, chlorophyll absorbs carbon dioxide from the air and water, and converts them first into starch, then into sugar. These are then transported through the leaf veins, branches, and stems to various cells, where they are combined with minerals absorbed by the roots to become the materials needed for plant growth, such as lignin, protein, and fat. At the same time as this process, chlorophyll also produces some oxygen, which is released through the leaf pores. This process of absorbing carbon dioxide and releasing oxygen is the respiration of plants, called "assimilation." However, the assimilation process that occurs with chlorophyll requires the power of sunlight; this process does not occur at night. Therefore, at night, plants do not exhale oxygen and absorb carbon dioxide, but rather absorb oxygen and exhale carbon dioxide. When the textbook says that plants also need oxygen, it is referring to this.
　　Animals and plants are the two main factors that constitute the great cycle of nature. Animals mostly rely on plants for survival, and plants also rely on animals for survival. This is especially evident in their respective "respiration."

### 植物也要吸氧气

　　植物也要吸氧气编辑先生：
    我在平常知道空气与生物的关系，是动物吸氧呼炭，植物吸炭呼氧。但高小自然第二册第四课“空气的成分与生物的关系”中的末尾却写道：“植物缺少了空气也长不成，因为它需要吸收空气里面的炭酸气和氧，才能生长。”这样说，植物呼出的是什么气？这么说，是新的说法吗？或是书中有了错误？请指教。
    　　　　　　    　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　（乔如）乔如君：
    书上的说法并不错误，而且也不是新说法。
    关于植物的呼吸作用，主要要明白“植物叶子的作用”。根据科学的实验，我们知道植物叶子里有一种叶绿素，它经过叶子上面的小孔，吸收空气中的炭酸气（即二氧化炭）和水分，并将它们先变成淀粉，再变为糖质，经由叶脉、枝、茎等输送至各部细胞，随后再与由根部吸收之矿物质相溶合，变成各种植物生长所需要的材料，如木质、蛋白质、脂肪等。与此作用同时，叶绿素也生出一部份氧，由叶孔中放出来，这种吸收炭酸气放出氧的作用，即植物的呼吸作用，叫做“同化作用”。不过叶绿素所发生的同化作用，须凭借日光之力，夜间即无此种作用。所以夜里便不是呼氧吸炭，而是吸氧呼炭。课本中说植物也需要氧，便是指此而言。
    动物与植物，是构成自然界大循环的两个主要因素，动物多靠植物为生，植物也靠动物为生，表现在彼此的“呼吸作用”一点上，更为明显。
