Xinhua News Agency, Beiping, 26th: After Mr. Ma Xulun, Mr. Wang Shaoao, and Ms. Xu Guangping, executive directors of the China Association for Promoting Democracy, arrived in Beiping, they were shocked to learn that a so-called "North China Branch of the China Association for Promoting Democracy" had been active in Beiping. They issued an emergency statement on February 26, stating: Recently, a person named Wang Minhou has been using the name of the "China Association for Promoting Democracy" to repeatedly publish announcements in Beiping newspapers. The second announcement stated: "Before the liberation of Beiping, this association had a temporary organization that responded to military affairs," and so on. Upon investigation, the association has not yet established a branch in North China, and there is no military organization to speak of. The announcement is clearly unrelated to the association. In addition to further investigation and reporting to the Beiping Military Control Commission, this statement is hereby made.

    否认所谓“中国民主促进会华北分会”
    【新华社北平二十六日电】中国民主促进会常务理事马叙伦、王绍凿、许广平诸先生到平后，得知平市曾有所谓“中国民主促进会华北分会”者，到处活动，深为骇异，特于二月二十六日发表紧急声明称：顷有王敏侯者用“中国民主促进会”名义，迭在北平报上登载启事，其第二次启事内称：“平市未解放前本会曾有响应军事之临时组织”云云。查本会在华北尚未成立分会，更无军事组织之可言，该项启事显与本会无关。除另行查究启呈报本市军事管制委员会外，合即声明。
