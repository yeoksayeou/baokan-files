　　The troops of a certain regiment of a certain division of the North China People's Liberation Army, currently undergoing political consolidation in the suburbs of Beiping, have won the love of the residents of the villages where they are stationed and are as close as family because they actively help and care for the masses. When the troops first moved into the villages, the regimental party committee called on "everyone to publicize and maintain discipline, and strive to be models of discipline." In order to understand the difficulties of the village cadres and solicit villagers' opinions in a timely manner, the political office and supply office jointly formed a discipline maintenance team to check discipline daily. The soldiers' committees of each company also made specific resolutions based on this call and decision. First, they launched a "fill the water tank" campaign to ensure that the landlords had water to use. Soldier Li Fengcun of the Ninth Company carried water for his landlord 140 times in more than a month. Second, they did their best so that "wherever the People's Liberation Army goes, construction goes." The soldiers not only cleaned the courtyards and streets where they were stationed, but also helped poor landlords with their housework, such as repairing pig pens, delivering manure, chopping firewood, paving courtyards, cutting grass, grinding flour, and feeding livestock. The stretcher second class of the hygiene team delivered thirteen large carts of manure, and the Sixth Squad of the Special Service Company—the breeding squad—produced 120 loads of manure in one day. In order to respect local customs, each squad and platoon established military toilets, and during the New Year, they cleared out rooms for the landlords, paid New Year visits, and invited the family members of military personnel who were landlords to eat. The First Battalion, originally stationed in Changle Village, even sent a Yangko team to Changle Village, three or four miles away, to pay New Year's visits when they moved to Bajia Village for the New Year. The residents deeply experienced that the People's Liberation Army was their own army, dispelled their doubts, and were very kind to the People's Liberation Army.

　　平郊整训我军爱护群众
    军民团结亲如家人
    【本报讯】现在北平近郊进行政治整训的华北解放军某师某团，由于积极帮助、照顾群众，得到驻村居民的热爱，亲如一家。部队一开头住在村里，团党委就号召“人人宣传，维护纪律，争取遵纪模范”。并为了解村干部困难，及时征求村民意见，由政治处供给处合组纪律维护组，每日检查纪律。各连士兵委员会并根据这一号召和决定，做出具体决议。首先开展满缸运动，保证房东有水用。九连战士李凤存一个多月给房东担水达一百四十担。其次做到“解放军到哪里，建设到哪里”。战士们不但把驻村的院、街都打扫干净，并协助贫苦房东建设家务，如修猪圈、送粪、劈柴、垫院铡草、推碾子、喂牲口等，卫生队的担架二班送粪十三大车，特务连六班——饲养班，有一天竟出粪一百二十担。为了尊重当地风俗习惯，各班、排都建立了军人厕所，过年时都给房东腾房子、拜年、请军属房东吃饭。一营原来驻在常乐村，搬到八家村过年时，组织的秧歌队还到三、四里外常乐村去拜年，居民深深体验到解放军是自己的军队，解除了怀疑，对解放军非常亲切。
