　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 10th. TASS, Paris: The French government forbade the Paris women's demonstration commemorating International Women's Day on the 6th. Women's groups called on Paris women to gather at the Buffalo stadium in the suburbs to express their determination to fight for peace and democracy and to unite in the struggle against the instigators of new wars and their French agitators. On the afternoon of the 6th, despite the long journey and the cold weather, more than 30,000 women and men from Paris flocked to the stadium. Demonstrators held up various slogans and flags, and despite the obstruction of a large number of police, they continued to arrive at the railway terminus, shouting slogans along the way: "Unite to defend peace!" "Make peace with Vietnam!" "Moch (referring to the French Minister of the Interior) is a murderer!" "Return Fontainebleau to France!" and other slogans.
　　　　"The mothers of France will never let their children fight against the Soviets!"

　　The stands and sports field of the stadium were packed. Slogans, French flags and red flags flew everywhere. On several large banners were written slogans such as: "The mothers of France will never let their children fight against the Soviets." "Unite to defend peace!" "Make peace with Vietnam!" "Expose the warmongers!" "Down with the instigators of new wars!"

　　On one of the stands, representatives of various democratic groups and intellectuals gathered. Among them were A.T. Farges, Olga Tournade, Kriegel-Valrimont, Elsa Triolet, Elian (Single Socialist Party), writers Aragon and Vercors, and many others.

　　Marcel-De Briel (representative of the Association of Families of Martyrs) in her opening speech, like other speakers, condemned Interior Minister Moch for prohibiting women from demonstrating in Paris to commemorate International Women's Day. She said: Our gathering here proves that the government's unreasonable measure to ban demonstrations in the city center has not destroyed our fighting power. The prohibition of peaceful demonstrations proves that those who intend to sign the "North Atlantic Treaty" are indeed preparing a new war.

　　Mrs. Gordon spoke on behalf of the 80 million members of the Women's International Democratic Federation. She said: Women have one most important task this year, and everything else is secondary to this task. That is to defend peace. If all women oppose war, then war will not happen.

　　Chamatte of the French Women's Union said: We are gathered here to say "no" to the anti-Soviet and anti-French people's war that is being prepared. Our task is to crush this war preparation, which only benefits capitalists. Chamatte called on women to actively fight against warmongers and to strive for an end to the war of aggression against Vietnam. She shouted: We want to maintain friendship with the Soviet Union.

　　Fargues, chairman of the Peace and Freedom Fighters Society, exposed the conspiracy of the warmongers and said: We are gathered here to reaffirm our will to fight for peace. We must arm ourselves and fight back against the propaganda that slanders those who support peace. Today, we are stronger than ever before. France does not want war. We must take action and do everything we can to win the struggle for peace.

　　Elian, secretary of the Single Socialist Party, condemned the right-wing socialists as lackeys of imperialism.

　　The meeting ended with the singing of the "Marseillaise" and the "Internationale". Subsequently, columns of demonstrators paraded through the stadium.

　　冲破大批警察阻挠
  　巴黎妇女集会争取和平
    【新华社陕北十日电】塔斯社巴黎讯：法政府禁止了巴黎妇女于六日举行的纪念国际妇女节的示威游行。各妇女团体就号召巴黎妇女到市郊布发洛体育场开会，表示她们争取和平民主，及在反对新战争挑拨者及其法国煽动者的斗争中团结一致的意志。六日下午，不顾路途遥远和寒冷的天气，三万余巴黎的妇女和男子，成群结队地来到体育场。示威者高举各种标语和旗帜，他们不顾大批警察的阻挠，不断到达铁道终点，沿途高呼：“团结起来保卫和平！”“与越南讲和！”“摩许（按系法内政部长）是刽子手。”“枫丹白露归还法国！”等口号。
    　　　　“法国的母亲们决不让她们的孩子去对苏作战！”
    体育场的看台和运动场挤满了人。标语、法国国旗和红旗到处飞扬。在若干大幅的标语上，写着下面这样的口号：“法国的母亲们决不让她们的孩子去对苏作战。”“团结起来保卫和平！”“与越南讲和！”“揭露战争贩子！”“打倒新战争挑拨者！”
    在一座看台上，聚集着各民主团体和知识分子的代表。其中有爱Ｔ·法戎，奥尔加·杜尔纳德，克里格·伐利蒙，爱尔沙·特里奥勒，艾利安（单一社会党），作家阿拉贡和维尔约等许多人。
    马色尔德·白里（死难烈士家属协会代表）在开幕词中象其他演说者一样，斥责内长摩许禁止妇女在巴黎示威纪念国际妇女节。她说：我们在此地集会，证明政府禁止在市中心示威的无理措施，并未摧毁我们的战斗力。禁止和平示威，证明了那些打算签订“北大西洋公约”的人们的确在准备新战争。
    戈登夫人代表国际民主妇女联盟八千万会员讲话。她说：妇女们在今年有一件最重要的任务，其他一切都以这一任务为转移。这就是保卫和平。假如一切妇女都反对战争，那么战争就不会发生。
    法国妇女联盟的夏马特说：我们在此地集会，对正在准备着的反苏反法国人民的战争说：“不要”。我们的任务是粉碎这一战争准备，这一战争只有利于资本家。夏马特号召妇女们积极斗争，反对战争贩子，争取终止对越南的侵略战争，她高呼：我们要保持对苏友谊。
    争和平与自由战士社主席法尔基揭露战争贩子的阴谋，并说：我们在此地集会，重申我们争取和平的意志。我们必须武装起来，予诽谤支持和平者的宣传以反击。今天，我们较过去任何时期更强大。法兰西不要战争。我们必须行动起来，尽一切努力赢得争和平的斗争。
    单一社会党书记艾利安斥责右翼社会党为帝国主义的走狗。
    会议结束时高唱“马赛曲”和“国际歌”。随后，一列列的示威者列队穿过体育场。
