　　North China Pictorial Society
    Holds Window Display Exhibition

    [Our Newspaper] After the liberation of Beiping, the North China Pictorial Society of the Political Department of the North China Military Region held seven large-scale photo exhibitions in succession, which were well received by the masses. In order to bring the photos closer to the masses, the North China Pictorial Society has recently held a window display exhibition for more than twenty days. The content is: Fighting for the Liberation of the People, The People Fully Support the War, and From the Yellow River to the Yangtze River, etc., ten sets of photos, distributed in the shop windows of Dongsi, Dongdan, Wangfujing, Bamianyan, Xisi, Xidan, Qianwai and other main streets, are changed once a week. The exhibition has been going on for more than twenty days, and the audience is still very crowded. In the window of Zhongyuan Photo Studio on the east side of Xidan, last week's exhibition of "From the Yellow River to the Yangtze River" attracted even more viewers. An old gentleman surnamed Qi said after seeing the photos: "General Liu Bocheng's plan is really brilliant. Crossing the Yellow River is not a simple matter!"
