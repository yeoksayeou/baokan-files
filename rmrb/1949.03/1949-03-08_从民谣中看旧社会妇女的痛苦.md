Seeing the Suffering of Women in Old Society Through Folk Songs
　　Bai Hua

　　Recalling the past thousands of years of feudal oppression, the lives of our women were truly like cattle and horses. Women suffered direct oppression from feudal forces, as well as oppression from various feudal customs and systems. Just from some of the folk songs in our North China Liberated Area, we can see what kind of role women played in the old society. "The spinning wheel turns and turns; raising a daughter doesn't earn money." Four dishes, two pots of wine; send the daughter off in a sedan chair. Raising pigs, you get to eat meat; raising dogs, they guard the house; raising cats, they catch mice, what good is raising you, a girl?!"

　　In the old society, a daughter was just a money-losing commodity, even worse than pigs and dogs! Let's look at the situation of some sisters from the words and expressions of their brothers and sisters-in-law: "The stars in the sky are all yellow, the little girl on the ground has no parents; good fathers and mothers are treasures, no father and no mother is a blade of grass. The brother combing his hair in the side room scolds, the sister-in-law combing her hair in the kitchen also dislikes her."...

　　From these verses, we can see that the hearts of women in the old society were filled only with sorrow, lament, and injustice. ...

　　But, this is still somewhat the situation in her mother’s home; and after getting married, the unspeakable pain is even worse! Taking the well-known abuse by mothers-in-law and sisters-in-law as an example! "A gourd shakes three times, the newlywed daughter-in-law is really suffering; if she walks slowly, they complain she is like a wooden statue, if she walks fast, they complain she is flustered. If she likes sour, they add vinegar, if she likes spicy, they add more garlic; she cooks and respectfully serves the parents-in-law, and diligently serves soup to the younger sisters and brothers-in-law. Taking advantage of spare time to sew shoe soles, she has to make two pairs in the time it takes to eat a meal. ... She eats a bowl of thick porridge that is left over, and drinks a bowl of thin soup that is left over; ... if there is no thick or thin left, she tightens her belt and waits until late in the afternoon. ...""The laundry stone, rings loudly! The father-in-law likes to drink wine, the mother-in-law likes to play cards; there is no rice in the pot of boiling water, I go to the south to scoop with a ladle. One scoop breaks the ladle, coming to the courtyard—the father-in-law smashes the wine bottle, the mother-in-law throws down the cards and curses; the younger sister and brother-in-law go up and grab my hair. One strand on the left, one strand on the right; my face is covered in blood and tears. ..."

　　These are still women who have gone through formal marriage, and being a daughter-in-law is still better. But if, from childhood, due to the poverty of her family, she is sold to a wealthy family as a child bride, the suffering she endures is even more unspeakable. "Little jujube tree, swaying in the wind; child brides are really suffering. Enduring the father-in-law and enduring the mother-in-law, stomping on the pot holder and holding the ladle; even a sip of rice soup is comfortable!" ...

　　Not willing to be a daughter-in-law in front of the parents-in-law, but rather hoping to drink some rice soup after the parents-in-law die; such a painful situation is imaginable. ... There is also: "Moonlight, bright and clear, child bride washing clothes. Washing them white, washing them clean, the mother-in-law complains that I am useless; raising her hand to hit, opening her mouth to scold; and saying she will divorce me! Mother-in-law, mother-in-law, don't divorce me, I have no home and no money; let me be a beast of burden, don't complain even if I die, ..."

　　Such inhuman treatment, even hoping to be a beast of burden and failing to achieve it; the suffering of child brides is even more than words can describe.

　　Those wealthy and powerful landlords, wantonly played with and humiliated women in every possible way; countless women of the working people were ravaged by them! "Wives, wives are like mud, if one dies, we'll just marry another! For poor people, losing a wife is like losing their life, for rich people, losing a wife is good luck." "Poor people's homes, have nothing: weaving cloth in the morning, spinning yarn in the evening; eating bran and vegetables and having no money to spend. ... Rich people's homes, are grand, with mules and horses in groups and extravagant; eating delicacies, drinking fragrant tea, with groups of wives and concubines to entertain them; when it's hot, three wives fan them, when it's cold, four concubines embrace them and drape them with sable coats. ..."

　　If, unfortunately, a woman is born a little stupid, she will be subjected to glares, beatings, scolding and abandonment at any time. The fickle moods of those wealthy and powerful landlords even became the standard for women's life and death. For example: "Sour jujube pit, thick in the middle, the first day the daughter-in-law enters the house. The husband hates her for being too ugly at first sight, the mother-in-law also says her feet are not pointed; the husband beats her and the mother-in-law scolds her, the daughter-in-law suffers like eating Coptis chinensis. Not giving tea or water, not giving food, tears welling up, her heart is so sour; the mother-in-law scolds and chases her out the door, the husband forces her to return to her mother's home. Walking one li, crying two times, returning to her mother's home without a good face; crying and sitting in the wilderness, tears flowing. ......"

　　Since the beginning of the People's War of Resistance Against Japan, under the leadership of the Communist Party and the democratic government, the women of the North China Liberated Area have embarked on a new historical path. In the land reform, they overthrew the feudal shackles of the landlords. In supporting the front line of production and participating in the work of the democratic government, they improved their political and social status. In the family, they gradually gained equal rights with men, and many labor heroes and models of supporting the front line emerged. However, because women are not yet completely economically independent, and the poison of feudal society has not been completely eliminated, continued efforts are still needed to truly and completely liberate women.

　　从民谣中看旧社会妇女的痛苦
    柏桦
    回忆过去数千年封建压迫下，我们妇女所过的生活真如牛马，妇女受着封建势力直接压迫，并且还受着各种封建习惯制度的压迫。单从我华北解放区的一些民歌中，就可看出在旧社会里，我们妇女是一个什么样的角色呢？“纺花车，转针连；养活闺女不赚钱。”四盘菜，两壶酒；打发闺女上轿走。养活猪，吃口肉；养活狗，会看家；养活猫猫拿耗子，养活你这丫头干什么？！……”
    一个闺女在旧社会里，就是一个赔钱货，甚至连猪狗也不如的！我们再从兄嫂的谈吐，眼色里，来看看某些姐妹们的处境：“天上的星星颗颗黄，地下的小女无爷娘；好爹好娘金活宝，无爹无娘一根草。侧屋里梳头哥哥骂，厨房里梳头嫂也嫌。”……
    从这些诗句里，可以看出旧社会妇女心中充满的只是沉痛、哀怨和不平。……
    但，这多少还是在娘家；而等出了嫁以后，那难言的痛苦就更甚一层了！如以习知的受公婆、小姑的虐待为例吧！“一个葫芦摇三摇，新娶的媳妇实难熬；走的慢了嫌木像，走的快了嫌慌张。好吃酸的给加醋，好吃辣的多加蒜；做熟公婆面前恭送上，小姑小叔还要勤送汤。趁着空儿纳鞋底，一顿饭功夫要两双。……剩下稠的吃碗子饭，剩下稀的喝碗子汤；……稠的稀的都不剩，紧紧裤带等到大后晌。…”“捶布石，响叮当！公公好吃酒，婆婆好打牌；锅里水滚没有米，俺去南边捞笊篱。一捞捞烂了，来院里——公公酒瓶砸，婆婆摔牌骂；小姑、小叔上去揪头发。左一绺，右一绺；满面流血泪花花。……”
    这些，还是经过正式婚嫁的女子，作媳妇还是比较好点。而如果从小因娘家贫困，卖寄出去给有钱人家作童养媳的，那所受的磨折就更难言了。“小枣树，随风摇；童养媳妇实难熬。熬住公公熬住婆，脚蹬锅牌手拿杓；喝口米汤也舒服！”……
    不愿在公婆面前作媳妇，宁愿在公婆死后能喝点米汤；这种痛楚的处境，就可想而知了。……还有：“月亮地，明光光，童养媳妇洗衣裳。捶的白，洗的净，婆婆嫌俺不中用；举手就是打，张嘴就是骂；又说把俺休了吧！婆婆婆婆别休俺，俺无家又无钱；任俺作牛马，死也莫怨言，……”
    这样的非人待遇，甚至希望作一匹牛马而不得；童养媳妇之苦，那就更不是笔墨、言语所能形容了。
    那些有钱有势的老财们。对女人百般玩弄凌辱；劳动人民的妇女，不知被他们糟蹋了多少！“媳妇媳妇象泥皮，死了一个咱再娶！穷人丧妻如丧命，富人丧妻交好运。”“穷人家，没什吗：朝织布，晚纺纱；糟糠咽菜没钱花。……富人家，架子大，骡马成群多奢华；吃珍餐，喝香茶，妻妾成群陪着耍；热了三妻打扇子，冷了四妾搂着披上貂皮褂。……”
    如果再不幸，女人生得笨了些，就会随时遭受白眼打骂和遗弃，那些有钱有势的老财们，他们的无常的喜怒，甚至成了女人们生死的准绳。如：“酸枣核、粗中间，闺女过门第一天。丈夫一见嫌太丑，婆婆也说脚不尖；丈夫打来婆婆骂，媳妇苦似吃黄莲。不给茶水不给饭，眼泪汪汪心好酸；婆婆痛骂追出门，丈夫逼俺回家园。走一里，哭两关，回到娘家没好脸；哭坐荒野泪涟涟。…………”
    自从人民抗日战争开始，华北解放区的妇女在共产党和民主政府的领导下，才开始走上了新的历史道路，她们在土地改革中打翻了地主的封建枷锁，在生产支援前线与参加民主政府工作中，提高了自己的政治地位和社会地位，在家庭中也逐渐和男人一样取得平等的权利，涌现出许许多多的劳动英雄和支援前线模范。但是由于妇女在经济上尚未完全自立，封建社会的遗毒仍未完全消灭，仍需继续努力肃清，才能使妇女们真正完全解放。
