Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 4th: According to a TASS dispatch from The Hague on February 28th, the Dutch magazine "Amsterdam Weekly" published a letter from a Dutch officer stationed in Yogyakarta, describing the atrocities of the Dutch army in Indonesia. The letter stated: "As we marched along the highway towards Yogyakarta, all we could see was a sea of fire on the horizon. These were Indonesian villages burning. As soon as the troops commanded by Captain Westerling (notorious for ordering the massacre of 30,000 peaceful residents on Celebes Island) arrived in Yogyakarta, they established a terror organization similar to the German Gestapo." The letter continued: The Dutch army stationed in the Yogyakarta area conducted large-scale "punitive expeditions." "If any village fired a shot at us, the Dutch army immediately set fire to the village from all sides. The Dutch army used machine guns to strafe fleeing residents, including women and children. Indonesians were often stabbed to death on the spot with bayonets, or beaten to death with knives and gun butts. In one place, more than two hundred Indonesians were stabbed to death. At another location, after one of our officers stepped on a landmine, the residents of the surrounding three villages were immediately warned: if they did not reveal who planted the landmine within half an hour, their villages would be burned down. The Indonesians remained silent. At this point, the Dutch officer ordered half of the houses in the three villages to be burned down." However, the letter writer pointed out: "The Dutch army's punitive expeditions cannot but pay a high price; in my detachment alone, more than forty people have been killed and dozens injured."

　　荷军在印尼的暴行
    大批焚毁和平村庄　机枪扫射妇女儿童
    【新华社陕北四日电】据塔斯社海牙二月二十八日讯：荷兰阿姆斯特丹周刊发表荷兰驻日惹军官投寄的一封信，描述荷军在印尼的暴行。信中略称：“当我们沿着公路向日惹进军的时候，我们所能看到的就是地平线上的一片火海。这些都是正在燃烧着的印尼村庄。维斯特林上尉（他因曾在西里伯斯下令屠杀该岛三万和平居民而臭名昭彰）所指挥的部队一到日惹之后，就成立了与德国盖斯塔波一样的恐怖组织。”该信继称：驻在日惹地区的荷军进行大规模的讨伐，“任何村庄如果向我们开一枪，荷军立即从各方面纵火焚烧这个村庄。荷军用机枪扫射逃跑着的居民，包括妇女与儿童在内。印尼人常常被用刺刀就地刺死，或被刀和枪柄击毙。有一个地方，印尼人民被刺死两百之多。在另一个地点，当我们一个军官踩中了地雷之后，周围三个村庄的居民马上就得到警告：如果他们在半小时内不说出是谁埋的地雷，那么他们的村庄将被焚毁。印尼人默不作声。这时荷兰军官即命令将三个村庄的房屋均烧毁一半。”但投信者指出：“荷军的讨伐不能不付出很高的代价，仅我所属的分队里，已有四十余名被击毙，数十人受伤。”
