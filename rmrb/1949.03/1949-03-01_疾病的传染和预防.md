To address the concerns of readers from various regions regarding the current outbreak of local diseases and requests for prevention methods, this newspaper has specially commissioned Yin Xipeng, Minister of Health of the North China People's Government, to write this article for study and implementation across various localities.
                                                      ——Editor

Diseases that can be transmitted to humans are called infectious diseases. For example, if Zhang San is sick and Li Si comes into contact with him and develops the same illness, then Zhang San has infected Li Si; Li Si has contracted an infectious disease. Tuberculosis (consumption), tinea, scabies, malaria, smallpox, typhoid fever, measles, cholera... are all infectious diseases. Everyone knows this, but "why do they transmit?" "How do they transmit?" "How can we prevent transmission?" are questions that may not be fully understood! Below, we will discuss these three questions.

Why do they transmit?

Many people don't know where their illnesses come from and become suspicious and fearful. Some say it's bad luck and they're destined for misfortune; some say it's karmic retribution from a past life; some say they've offended ghosts and gods and are being punished. Little do they know that disease transmission is caused by bacteria!

Bacteria belong to the plant kingdom (trees, flowers, and grasses are all plants) and are extremely small. Based on their different shapes, they have various names; round ones are called cocci, thin and long ones are called bacilli, and thin, long, and spirally curved ones are called spirilla. They can also reproduce, the method being fission: a single bacterium splits in the middle to become two. Each reproduction doubles the original number. Reproduction is surprisingly fast. Some like to live in water, some like to grow in dry land. Some depend on air to survive, while others die when exposed to air. Some grow inside the human body. Those that grow inside the human body and cause illness are called pathogenic bacteria. Otherwise, they are called non-pathogenic bacteria. When pathogenic bacteria enter the human body, they divide and reproduce, producing toxins that cause changes in a part or the whole body. These changes are what we call disease. Because bacteria are of different types, the diseases they cause in the human body are also different. Medical pioneers have already identified the pathogenic bacteria for various diseases such as typhoid fever, cholera, and tuberculosis. Now, by determining the disease from the symptoms, we can determine which bacteria caused the infection.

How are diseases transmitted?

Bacteria are transmitted to humans through two routes: direct transmission and indirect transmission. These two methods of transmission are described below:

I. Direct Transmission: This is when Zhang San directly transmits the bacteria on his body to Li Si. This type of transmission is common. Here are a few examples: (1) Syphilis is transmitted through sexual intercourse. (2) Tuberculosis is transmitted through kissing or feeding with the mouth. (3) Infection occurs due to carelessness when caring for patients. (4) Using a towel to wipe your eyes after a person with trachoma has used it, resulting in trachoma. These are all examples of this type.

II. Indirect Transmission: This is when the bacteria on Zhang San's body leave him and are transmitted to Li Si through various things. The things involved can be various. Here are a few examples to illustrate:

(1) Droplet Transmission: People with tuberculosis cough and sneeze, expelling extremely small droplets of water, each containing countless tubercle bacilli, which float in the air. When others inhale these droplets into their lungs, it can cause the same lung disease.

(2) Waterborne Transmission: The vomit and excrement of cholera and typhoid fever patients are dumped into rivers or accidentally enter wells. Others who drink this water mixed with bacteria can have the bacteria multiply in their intestines, causing the same cholera or typhoid fever. This is waterborne transmission.

(3) Soilborne Transmission: Bacteria that thrive in the soil can enter the human body through skin wounds. One type specifically attacks the nervous system, causing the patient's jaw to lock and the whole body to convulse, which is medically called tetanus, and death occurs in a few days. In rural areas, many newborns die from "si liu feng" (tetanus neonatorum), because old-fashioned midwives use unsterilized scissors to cut the umbilical cord, sometimes even sharpening the scissors on the sole of a shoe, which picks up soil containing the "si liu feng" pathogens (a type of tetanus bacteria). When this comes into contact with the umbilical cord and enters the baby's blood, it becomes an incurable disease.

(4) Foodborne Transmission: People who care for cholera patients touch their vomit or feces and, without washing their hands carefully, take food, often contracting cholera themselves. If someone dumps the excrement of cholera patients (vomit, feces) upstream of a river, and people downstream wash vegetables in that water, those who eat the vegetables raw can be infected. Fruits and vegetables displayed on the street, which flies crawl all over, can also cause illness if eaten (see Insect Transmission).

(5) Carrier Transmission: Some people carry many pathogens on their bodies but do not get sick themselves. However, they spread the pathogens to others everywhere, causing them to get sick. Such people are called "carriers." Typhoid fever and diphtheria both have carriers. Newly recovered patients, those caring for patients, doctors, and people who have had direct or indirect contact with patients can all become "carriers."

(6) Insect Transmission: When we sleep, mosquitoes, flies, fleas, lice, and bedbugs crawl all over our faces and bodies, sucking and piercing, making it difficult to sleep and affecting work. They can also transmit many kinds of diseases. The diseases they transmit are listed in the following table:
Insect　Main Diseases Transmitted
Mosquito　Malaria
Bedbug　Relapsing Fever
Flea　Plague
Louse　Epidemic Typhus, Relapsing Fever
Fly　Bacillary Dysentery, Epidemic Dysentery, Amebic Dysentery, Cholera, Typhoid Fever, Paratyphoid Fever

Transmission Method: Mosquitoes, fleas, lice, and bedbugs all have needle-like mouths with hollow tubes that pierce the skin of patients (refer to the table above for diseases) to suck blood. Then, they go to suck blood from other people, delivering the bacteria they carry in their mouths into the other person's blood, causing that person to develop the same disease. Flies have uneven mouths and many fine hairs on their legs. They crawl on the vomit and feces of patients to feed, their mouths and legs covered with countless bacteria. Then, they fly onto fruits or other foods, leaving behind the "gifts" they carry. People who eat these foods will contract the disease.

The above has explained how diseases are transmitted. Below, we will discuss how to prevent transmission.

How can we prevent disease transmission?

Only prevention! Treating the disease after you have already contracted it, even if cured, costs money and suffering. Wouldn't it be better not to get sick in the first place!? If you want to avoid getting sick, you need to know how to prevent diseases from occurring.

(I) Prevention of Direct Transmission

1.  Do not share a pipe with others.
2.  Do not share a towel or basin of water with others for washing your face.
3.  Adults should not chew food and feed it to children.
4.  Do not live or eat together with people who have infectious diseases.
5.  Prohibit prostitution.

(II) Prevention of Indirect Transmission

1. Prevention of Droplet Transmission: People with tuberculosis should be aware that they should not cough or sneeze at others. They should cover their mouths with a handkerchief. Sputum, saliva, and nasal discharge should not be spat or discarded indiscriminately. They should be spat into a sputum cup (or small basin, small jar) containing lime powder.

Houses and furniture and bedding used by general infectious disease patients can be disinfected with carbolic acid solution or formalin gas (carbolic acid and formalin are sold in Western pharmacies) to strictly prevent transmission.

Carbolic Acid Solution Disinfection Method:

Prescription: Slowly add three parts of carbolic acid to ninety-seven parts of water for epidemic prevention, and let it dissolve. Shake before use.

Usage: Wipe or spray it on houses and utensils. Immerse clothing for two hours or more to disinfect.

Caution: When dissolving carbolic acid, remove the bottle stopper first and place it in warm water or near a fire. Otherwise, there is a risk of explosion.

Formalin Gas Disinfection Method:

Preparation: Mix half a catty of sawdust with formalin water (one part formalin to five parts water), stir until moist, and spread it on a floor six feet long and three feet wide (adjust the amount according to the size of the room to cover the entire area). Also, pour formalin water into a small pot and heat it to make it evaporate. Before doing this, open the doors of cabinets and wardrobes in the room and hang up the clothes. Then spread the formalin sawdust, heat the formalin water, and close the doors and windows tightly, preferably sealing them. After a day and a night, open the doors and windows, sweep away the sawdust, and the room is ready for use.

2.  Prevention of Waterborne Transmission: The simplest and most effective method is to boil the water before drinking it. No bacteria can withstand the heat of boiling water; they can all be killed. People drink more boiled water in winter, so cholera and dysentery are less common. People drink more cold water (unboiled water) in summer, so epidemic diseases are more common, which proves this point. During an infectious disease epidemic, well water can be disinfected using the following methods to avoid danger.

Well Water Disinfection Method: Generally, bleaching powder solution is used.

Bleaching Powder Solution Preparation: First, take a certain amount of bleaching powder, add a small amount of water and grind it, then add water to make a 30-fold solution (one part bleaching powder to twenty-nine parts water). Let it stand for a while to clarify, and pour the clear liquid on top into a colored glass bottle for storage.

Mixing Method: Add a certain amount of bleaching powder solution according to the amount of water in the well. Calculate the amount according to the table below. After adding, stir with a bucket.

Well Water Volume Measurement Method: First, use a rope to hang a stone and sink it to the bottom of the well, measure the depth of the water, and then measure the well opening. Use the table below to find the water volume. For example, if the diameter of the well opening is three feet and the water is nine feet deep, the water volume is 10 shi (approximately 1000 liters), according to the table. The amount of disinfectant to be added is 3% of the bleaching powder solution, which is 300 cc (each cc weighs approximately 2.5 fen).

| Well Opening Diameter |  2 feet          | 2.5 feet         | 3 feet          |
|-----------------------|-----------------|-----------------|-----------------|
| Water Volume & Liquid Amount | Volume | Bleaching Powder Liquid 3% | Volume | Bleaching Powder Liquid 3% | Volume | Bleaching Powder Liquid 3% |
| Water Depth 2 feet  | 1.0 shi | 30 CC.   | 1.5 shi | 50 CC.   | 2.0 shi | 70 CC.   |
| 3 feet              | 1.5   | 45     | 2.3   | 75     | 3.3   | 100    |
| 4 feet              | 2.0   | 60     | 3.0   | 90     | 4.4   | 140    |
| 5 feet              | 2.5   | 75     | 4.0   | 120    | 5.5   | 170    |
| 6 feet              | 3.0   | 90     | 4.5   | 140    | 6.5   | 200    |
| 7 feet              | 3.5   | 105    | 5.5   | 160    | 7.7   | 230    |
| 8 feet              | 4.0   | 120    | 6.0   | 180    | 9.0   | 270    |
| 9 feet              | 4.5   | 135    | 7.0   | 200    | 10.0  | 300    |
| 10 feet             | 5.0   | 150    | 8.0   | 230    | 11.0  | 330    |

| Well Opening Diameter |  3.5 feet         | 4 feet          |
|-----------------------|-----------------|-----------------|
| Water Volume & Liquid Amount | Volume | Bleaching Powder Liquid 3% | Volume | Bleaching Powder Liquid 3% |
| Water Depth 2 feet  | 3.0 shi | 100 CC.  | 4.0 shi | 130 CC.  |
| 3 feet              | 4.5   | 140    | 6.0   | 180    |
| 4 feet              | 6.0   | 180    | 8.0   | 240    |
| 5 feet              | 7.5   | 230    | 10.0  | 300    |
| 6 feet              | 9.0   | 270    | 12.0  | 350    |
| 7 feet              | 10.0  | 320    | 14.0  | 410    |
| 8 feet              | 12.0  | 360    | 16.0  | 470    |
| 9 feet              | 13.5  | 400    | 18.0  | 500    |
| 10 feet             | 15.0  | 450    | 20.0  | 580    |

Effective Time: Thirty minutes after stirring, the dysentery, typhoid fever, paratyphoid fever, and cholera bacteria in the well will be completely killed, and the water will be safe to drink. Some people ask how long the disinfection lasts. This depends on the amount of water in the well and the quality of the surrounding environment. Generally speaking, if a large amount of water is used continuously and it is constantly being contaminated, it can last for five hours. If the well is deep, and little water is used, it can last up to twelve hours.

Number of Additions: In areas where infectious diseases are prevalent, communal wells often have the danger of being contaminated. Add the solution three times a day (morning, noon, and evening).

　　疾病的传染和预防
    殷希彭
    据各地读者来函，目前已有许多地方病疫开始流行，要求提出防疫办法，本报特约华北人民政府卫生部部长殷希彭写此一文，以供各地研究实施。
                                                      ——编者
    能够传人的病叫传染病，比如张三有病，李四和他接近了一下，就也发同样的病，这就是张三传染了李四；李四得了传染病。结核（痨病）、癣疥、疟疾、天花、伤寒、麻疹、霍乱……全是传染病。大家也都知道，可是“为什么会传染？”“怎样传染？”“怎样才不传染？”就不定知道很多！下面就将这三个问题说一说。
    为什么会传染？
    许多人生病不知病从何来，疑神疑鬼；有的说运气不好，应该生灾；有的说是前世冤孽，今世报应；有的说冲撞了鬼神，降给了惩罚。那里晓得疾病的传染是细菌哩？！
    细菌是属于植物（树木花草都是植物），非常之小，根据它不同的形状，有各种不同的名称；圆的叫球菌，细而长的叫杆菌，细长而纡曲作螺旋状的叫螺旋菌。它们也能滋生后代，方法是分裂，一个细菌从中间裂开就成两个细菌。每滋生一次，增加原数的一倍。滋生时间想不到的快。有喜欢生在水里的，有喜欢长在旱地的。有依赖空气生存的，也有见空气就死的，也有生长在人的身体内的。凡在人的身体内生长，惹人生病的，就叫病原菌。否则叫非病原菌，病原菌进入人体，分裂滋生，产生毒素，使一部分或全身发生变化，这种变化就是所谓疾病。因为细菌种类不一样，在人体内惹起的病也就不一样。医界先辈已经把各种不同的病如伤寒、霍乱、结核等等的病原菌都查清楚了，现在我们只从病症上断定是什么病，就可以断定是由哪种细菌传染来的。
    病是怎样传染的？
    细菌传染到人，不外两种途径——直接传染和间接传染，以下分述这两种传染方法：
    一、直接传染：就是张三直接把身上的细菌传给李四，这种传染很多，以下仅举几个例子：（一）梅毒由性交传染。（二）结核由接吻或用嘴喂食传染。（三）服侍病人不慎传染。（四）用砂眼病人擦了眼的手巾擦眼，着上砂眼、都是这类。
    二、间接传染：是张三身上的病菌，离开他，经过种种不同的东西才传染到李四的。经过的东西、各种各样，以下举几个例子说明：
    （一）飞末传染：害痨病的人，咳嗽喷嚏排泄出来极小的水珠，每一个水珠里包藏着无数的结核菌，飞扬在空中，旁人吸到肺里，惹起同样肺痨，就是这类。
    （二）饮水传染：霍乱伤寒病人呕吐的东西和大便，倒在河里，或误入井里，旁人喝了这种混有细菌的水，细菌就可在肠子里滋生，惹起同样的霍乱、伤寒，这便是饮水传染。
    （三）泥土传染：好在土里生长的细菌，借着人皮肤的外伤，钻入人体，有一种专侵犯神经，使病人牙关紧闭，全身抽筋，医学上叫做破伤风，三几天就死。乡间才生下的小儿得四六风死的很多，原因是旧式收生婆，用不消毒的剪刀剪脐带，有时还嫌剪刀不快，在鞋底上磨磨，粘上藏有四六风病原菌（破伤风菌的一种）的土，碰到脐带，进入小儿血里，就成了不治之症。就是这类。
    （四）食物传染：服侍害霍乱病的人，手接触他的呕吐物或大便，不注意洗手就拿东西吃，常常也传上霍乱。河的上流有人倒了霍乱病人的排泄物（呕吐物、大便），下流有人洗菜，生吃菜的人就会被传染。街头摆的瓜果，苍蝇爬来爬去，吃了它的人也会得病（详见昆虫传染）都属此类。
    （五）带菌人传染：有的人身上带着许多病原菌，自己却不生病，可是到处把病原菌传给别人，使别人害病，那种人，就叫做“带菌人”。伤寒、白喉病都有带菌人。刚好的病人、看护病人的人、医生们和病人直接或间接接触过的人，都可变成“带菌人”。
    （六）昆虫传染：睡觉时蚊、蝇、蚤、虱、臭虫在我们脸上身上爬来爬去，到处吮刺，使人睡不好觉，以致影响工作。还会传染很多种疾病，由它们传播的疾病。如下表：昆虫　主要传播的疾病蚊　疟臭虫　回归热蚤　鼠疫虱　发疹伤寒、回归热蝇　赤痢、疫痢、阿米巴赤痢、霍乱、伤寒、副伤寒
    传染法：蚊、蚤、虱、臭虫都有空管针样子的嘴，刺入病人（参考表上的疾病）皮肤吸血，以后又跑到旁人身上去吸，把嘴里带来的细菌送到旁人血里，这个人就发生同样的疾病。苍蝇嘴上高低不平，腿上多细毛，爬在病人的呕吐物和大便上吃食，嘴上腿上粘满了无数细菌，又飞到瓜果或其他食物上，把所带的礼物都留下，人吃了它，就会传染疾病。
    以上已经说明了怎样传染，下面再说怎样才不传染。
    病怎样才不传染？
    只有预防！已经得了病再治，就算治好了，也花钱受罪；那如不得病好！？想不得病，就要知道预防疾病发生的办法。
    （一）直接传染的预防
    一、不要和别人用一条烟袋；二、洗脸不要和别人共用一条手巾、一盆水；三、大人不要嚼东西喂小孩；四、不要和传染病人同居共食；五、禁止嫖娼。
    （二）间接传染的预防
    一、飞末传染的预防法：害肺痨的人，应该自觉，咳嗽喷嚏不要对着人，可用手帕掩着嘴、痰、唾液、鼻涕不要随地乱吐，要吐在盛石灰末的痰盂（或小盆、小罐）里。
    一般传染病人住过的屋子，用过的家具，被服，可用石炭酸水或福尔马林气体消毒（石炭酸、福尔马林，西药房出卖）严防传染。
    石炭酸水消毒法：
    处方：防疫用石炭酸三分中慢慢加水九十七分，让它溶解，使用时加以振荡。
    用法：房屋用具用它擦拭或喷洒，衣服类浸泡两点钟以上就可消毒。
    注意：溶解石炭酸时，应先把瓶塞拔去，放在温水或火边，不的话，有爆炸危险。
    福尔马林气体消毒法：
    制法：锯末半斤，加福尔马林水（一分福尔马林加五分水）搅匀湿透，撒在长六尺、宽三尺的地面上，（按屋子大小加量铺满）。并将福尔马林水倒入小锅里，加热使其蒸发。做时先将屋里厨、柜门打开，衣服挂起，然后撒福尔马林锯末，福尔马林水加热，将门窗闭紧，最好加封。经过一天一夜，再打开门窗，扫去锯末，即可住用。
    二、饮水传染预防法：最简单最确实的方法，就是把水煮开了喝。什么细菌亦禁不住开水的热度，都可煮死。冬天人多喝开水，所以霍乱、痢疾病少，夏天人多喝冷水（未煮过的水）所以时疫病症也多，可以证明这点。在传染病流行时，井水可用以下方法消毒，以免危险。
    井水消毒法：一般使用漂白粉液。
    漂白粉液制法：先用一定量的漂白粉，加少量水捏磨，再加水成三十倍的溶液（一分漂白粉加二十九分的水），放一会儿，让它澄清，把上面的清水倒在有色的玻璃瓶中备用。
    混入法：按井水量投入一定量的漂白粉液，份量按下面的表计算，投入后用水桶搅拌。
    井水量的测定法：先用绳吊着一块石头沉到井底，测水有多么深，再量井口，用下表求水量。例如井口对径三尺，水深九尺，按表计算水量是十石，应该加消毒药量，按同表所记，是百分之三的漂白粉液要三百西西（每一西西约重二分五厘）。井口径　　　　　　 2尺　　　　　　　　2.5尺　　　　　　　3尺水量及液量　水量　漂白粉液3%　　水量　漂白粉液3%　　水量　漂白粉液3%水深2尺　　　　　1.0石　30CC.　　　　1.5石　50CC.　　　2.0石　　70CC.3尺　　　　　1.5　　45　　　　　　2.3　　75　 　　　3.3　　　　1004尺　　　　　2.0　　60　　　　　　3.0　　90　 　　　4.4　　　　1405尺　　　　　2.5　　75　　　　　　4.0　　120　　　　5.5　　　　1706尺　　　　　3.0　　90　　　　　　4.5　　140　　　　6.5　　　　2007尺　　　　　3.5　　105　　   　　5.5　  160　　　　7.7　　　　2308尺　　　　　4.0　　120　　　 　　6.0　　180　　　　9.0　　　　2709尺　　　　　4.5　　135　　　 　　7.0　　200　　　　10.0　 　　30010尺　　　　 5.0　　150　　　 　　8.0　　230　　　　11.0　 　　330井口径　　　　　 3.5尺　　　　　　　　　　　4尺水量及液量　　水量　　漂白粉液3%　　　　水量　　漂白粉液3%水深2尺　　　　　　3.0石 　　100CC.　　　　　4.0石　　130CC.3尺　　　　　　4.5　 　　140　　　　　　 6.0　　　1804尺　　　　　　6.0　 　　180　　　　　 　8.0　　　2405尺　　　　　　7.5　 　　230　　　　 　　10.0　 　3006尺　　　　　　9.0　 　　270　　　　 　　12.0　 　3507尺　　　　　　10.0　　　320　　　　 　　14.0　　 4108尺　　　　　　12.0　　　360　　　　 　　16.0　　 4709尺　　　　　　13.5　　　400　　　　 　　18.0　　 50010尺　 　　　　15.0　　　450　　　　 　　20.0　　 580
    有效时间：搅拌后经过三十分钟，则井中的赤痢、伤寒、副伤寒、霍乱菌可以完全死灭，水就可吃。有人问这样消毒以后可以保持多久？这要看井水多少，和周围环境的好坏。一般说连续使用大量的水，又不断有被染脏时，能保持五点钟。若是井水深用水又少，就可以保持到十二点钟。
    混入次数：传染病流行的地方，大家共用的水井，常有被弄脏的危险时，一天投入三次（早、午、晚）。
