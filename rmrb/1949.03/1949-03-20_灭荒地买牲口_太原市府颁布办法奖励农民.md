(Jinzhong Electric) The Taiyuan Municipal Government recently promulgated measures to reward the elimination of wasteland and the purchase of draft animals. Under the Yan Xishan bandit regime’s "Soldiers and Farmers as One" tyranny, the Jinzhong area suffered widespread bankruptcy in urban and rural areas, with wasteland reaching more than 1.5 million mu, and a shortage of 100,000 head of draft animals. After liberation, farmers actively engaged in production, eliminating more than 300,000 mu of wasteland last autumn; however, there are still 1.1 million mu of wasteland that urgently need to be eliminated, becoming a major task in this year's spring plowing in the entire area. To this end, the Taiyuan Municipal Government has specifically promulgated two sets of measures to reward the elimination of wasteland and the purchase of draft animals: (1) Those who eliminate reclaimed wasteland that has been fallow for three to five years will be exempt from agricultural tax for two years; those who eliminate newly reclaimed wasteland that has been fallow for less than two years will have their agricultural tax reduced by half in the current year. (2) All draft animals purchased from neighboring areas with sufficient proof will be exempt from military service for two months. The above two reward measures have been notified to governments at all levels and will be implemented immediately during spring plowing mobilization. (Note: The Jinzhong Administrative Office has been abolished and merged with the Taiyuan Municipal People's Government. All special commissioner's offices and county governments formerly under the jurisdiction of the Jinzhong Administrative Office are temporarily under the leadership of the Taiyuan Municipal People's Government.)

　　灭荒地买牲口
  　太原市府颁布办法奖励农民
    【晋中电】太原市政府顷颁布奖励消灭荒地与购买耕畜办法。晋中区在阎匪“兵农合一”暴政下，曾造成广大城乡的破产，荒地达一百五十余万亩，耕畜缺少十万头。解放后，农民积极从事生产，去秋即消灭荒地三十余万亩；但现在仍有荒地一百一十万亩急待消灭，成为全区今年春耕中一个重大任务。为此太原市政府，特颁布奖励消灭荒地、购买耕畜两办法：（一）凡消灭三年至五年之熟荒者，按照农业税则免缴公粮二年；消灭二年以下之新荒者，当年公粮减半征收。（二）凡有充分证明系由邻区买进之耕畜，一律免服军勤两个月，以上两奖励办法，已通知各级政府，于春耕动员中立即执行。（按：晋中行政公署已撤销，与太原市人民政府合并，原晋中行署所辖各专署，县府均暂归并太原市人民政府领导。）
