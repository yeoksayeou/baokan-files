    [This newspaper's dispatch] The All-China Students' Federation recently received a letter of tribute to Chinese democratic students from the World Student Union Executive Committee, which was held in Prague at the end of January this year. The summary is as follows:
    Dear friends: The Executive Committee of the World Student Union, which convened in Prague at the end of January this year, extends its warmest congratulations to the heroic Chinese youth and students, because your people have overcome the forces of reaction and foreign interference and are moving towards a comprehensive victory of democratic progress. The democratic students of the world believe that this is a major contribution to world peace and the future of all students. Today, you and all the people are advancing towards the establishment of a free and democratic China. In your struggle against the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang supported by US imperialism, we extend our highest respect and full support to you. We pay our respects to those soldiers who sacrificed themselves for freedom and democracy in the youth and student movement.
