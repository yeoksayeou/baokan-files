To Guarantee the Supply of Industrial Raw Materials

　　Southern Hebei Plans to Plant 30,000 Mu of "S" Cotton

　　[Jinan Electric] To supply industrial raw materials, the Southern Hebei Cotton Production Promotion Agency plans to promote 30,000 mu of "2B" and "4B" "S" cotton. The characteristics of this cotton are: ① Long fruit branches and vigorous growth, with short upper branches and long lower branches. ② Many cotton bolls and high yield; seventy or eighty cotton bolls are enough to pick one *jin* of seed cotton, averaging 208 *jin* per *mu*; ③ The lint is clean, white, and long, suitable for spinning fine yarn; ④ The seed coat is thin, and seedlings emerge seven or eight days after sowing; ⑤ It matures early, and the cotton bolls are easy to pick when they open and do not stick to the bottom of the boll. This is a new variety hybridized from American Lone Star cotton and Stripper cotton. Experimental promotion began in this area in 1947. Over the past two years, it has proven that the cotton has a high yield, good quality, and is suitable for the soil in this area. Last year, 4,000 mu of "2B" "S" cotton was promoted in Linqing and Xiajin, and the masses responded well. In addition to deciding to promote 30,000 mu of "2B" and "4B" cotton in Xiajin, Linqing, Nangong, and Wei County this year, the Southern Hebei Cotton Production Promotion Agency will also use various methods to help the masses solve planting difficulties. However, other cotton varieties should be strictly prohibited from being sown in the planting area to prevent hybridization and variation. The seeds have been prepared, and cadres were dispatched to various promotion areas on the 23rd of last month to carry out work.

　　保证供给工业原料
  　冀南拟种斯字棉三万亩
    【冀南电】为供给工业原料，冀南棉产推进社计划推广“２Ｂ”、“４Ｂ”斯字棉三万亩。该种棉花的特点是：①果枝长、生长茂盛，上部枝短，下部枝长。②棉桃多产量大，一个棉桃五个瓣，七八十个棉桃就可以摘一市斤籽棉，每亩平均合二百零八市斤；③绒洁白细长，能纺细纱；④种籽皮薄，播种后七八天就可出来；⑤成熟早、棉桃开的时候容易采摘，不黏底。这是美国隆字棉和脱字棉杂交而成的新品种。一九四七年开始，在本区试验推广。两年中，证明该棉产量高，质量好，适宜于本区土壤。去年在临清、夏津曾推广“２Ｂ”斯字棉四千亩，群众反映良好。冀南棉产推进社除决定今年在夏津、临清、南宫、威县推广“２Ｂ”、“４Ｂ”棉三万亩外，并以各种办法帮助群众解决种植困难。但在种植区内，应严禁播种其他棉花，以防杂交变种。现种籽已准备好，上月二十三日已派干部分赴各推广区进行工作。
