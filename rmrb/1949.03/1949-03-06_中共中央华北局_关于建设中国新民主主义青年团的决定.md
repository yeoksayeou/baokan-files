    【本报讯】中共中央华北局于一九四九年一月二十二日公布关于建设中国新民主主义青年团的决定，全文如下：

    (1) We completely agree with the Central Committee's resolution on establishing the Chinese New Democratic Youth League.

    North China has basically been liberated. In order to strive for the complete victory of the People's Liberation War, to further consolidate and build North China, to unite and educate the broad masses of young people, to cultivate revolutionary reserve forces, and to give full play to the enthusiasm and creativity of young people in war, production, study, and work, establishing the New Democratic Youth League is of particularly important significance.

    (2) Establishing the New Democratic Youth League is the central link in the current development of the North China youth movement and one of the most important tasks for the entire party in North China at present. Party committees at all levels should conduct regular research and provide instructions on the work of the Youth League, and conduct inspections and summaries from time to time to strengthen leadership over youth committees at all levels. All departments related to the youth movement should assist in the work of building the League.

    (3) An important task in carrying out the work of building the League in North China is to select young cadres with firm stances, upright styles, and close ties to the masses to take on leadership positions at all levels. The heads of Youth League committees at all levels should have qualifications equivalent to those of party committee secretaries at the same level and at the next lower level, but county Youth League committee secretaries must have the qualifications of county party committee members, and district Youth League committee secretaries must be district party committee members, and cannot be filled by secretaries from the next lower level.

    The cadre staffing is temporarily set as follows: seven people for district party committees (each district party committee can set up a temporary work team of more than ten people; seven people for cities at the district party committee level), three people for prefectural committees, three to five people for county level (five people for large counties), two people for district level, specializing in youth work, not concurrently holding other positions, and pay attention to allocating a certain number of female cadres. It is necessary to equip all cadres above the level of county Youth League committee secretary and in key counties and districts as fully as possible by April of this year. Large and medium-sized cities such as Ping, Tianjin, Bao, Tang, Zhang, and Xuan should pay attention to equipping cadres for building the League and vigorously developing the work. Youth work cadres should not be changed frequently.

    In order to enable cadres to grasp the guiding principles of building the League, youth work cadres should undergo short-term training. In the party schools and training classes of party committees at all levels, set up youth cadre classes, train cadres above the district level in a planned and step-by-step manner, and gradually transfer approximately 5% to 10% of the number of party members to the League after short-term rotational training, as the backbone and foundation for building the League.

    (4) The steps for building the League should be promoted with a focus, and do not adopt an egalitarian or non-focused approach to building the League. We should start with cities, factories, schools, and large villages and towns where young people are more concentrated and the party's work is better, and then seek universal development.

    We should prevent the erroneous practice of coercively enlisting people and simply pursuing numbers; we should also prevent narrow closed-doorism, rejecting some advanced young people from the League.

    Youth departments should be gradually established in trade unions; in large state-owned enterprises, Youth League committees should be established and start building the League; in private factories with more young workers and better party and labor movement work, the League should also be built with a focus.

    The League should be universally established in middle schools and above (the steps should still be to create typical examples first and then promote them). Leading the Youth League is one of the most important tasks of the school party committee, and attention should be paid to improving the work of the student union. Youth League work should also be established in large agencies with many young people.

    In newly liberated cities, we should educate, transform, and unite intellectuals and young students, develop the student movement, and cooperate with trade unions to mobilize young workers and develop the workers' movement. In newly liberated rural areas, the main task is to mobilize young people to participate in the peasant movement and establish general youth organizations, such as peasant association youth groups, youth production teams, and study groups.

    The established Youth League should be consolidated, rectified, and developed in accordance with the spirit of the Central Committee's decision.

    (5) The North China Bureau has decided to convene the First Congress of the Chinese New Democratic Youth League North China Region in March this year to elect the Chinese New Democratic Youth League North China Regional Committee and elect delegates to attend the National Congress of the League. At present, preparatory committees for the League should be established at all levels above key counties, and youth League congresses of party committees in various districts should be convened in a timely manner to generate the leadership organs of the Youth League.

    In order to guide the work of the North China Youth League and organize the study of the broad masses of young people and children, it has been decided that the North China Youth Committee will publish periodicals and various popular reading materials for young people and children. Party committees in various districts should publish youth supplements and youth reading materials through local newspapers.

    (6) After receiving this decision, party committees at all levels should convene meetings based on the Central Committee's decision on building the League, the draft League Constitution, and other documents, and formulate specific work plans based on the youth situation in their respective regions, the historical characteristics of the youth movement, and the conditions of the masses, and earnestly supervise implementation. In the process of implementation, inspections should also be carried out from time to time, and a reporting system should be established.

　　中共中央华北局
    关于建设中国新民主主义青年团的决定
    （一九四九年一月二十二日）
    【本报讯】中共中央华北局于一九四九年一月二十二日公布关于建设中国新民主主义青年团的决定，全文如下：
    （一）我们完全同意中央关于建立中国新民主主义青年团的决议。
    华北全区已基本上获得解放，为了争取人民解放战争的彻底胜利，为了进一步巩固与建设华北，团结与教育广大青年，培养革命的后备力量，充分发挥青年在战争、生产、学习、工作中的积极性和创造性，建立新民主主义青年团，实有特殊重要的意义。
    （二）建立新民主主义青年团，是当前开展华北青年运动的中心环节，是华北全党目前极重要的工作之一。各级党委对青年团的工作应有经常的研究、指示，并随时检查总结，加强对各级青委的领导。各个与青运有关部门，对建团工作应予以协助。
    （三）开展华北建团工作的重要任务，是选择立场坚定、作风正派、联系群众的青年干部担任各级领导工作。各级团委负责人应具备相当于同级党委与下一级书记的条件，但县团委书记必须是具备县委委员的条件，区团委书记必须是区委委员，不能由下一级书记充任。
    干部编制，暂规定如下：区党委七人，每区党委可设临时的十人以上的工作队（相当于区党委级之市七人），地委级三人，县级三人至五人（大县五人），区级二人，专门从事青年工作，不得兼职，并注意配备一定数量的女干部。限于今年四月内尽可能把县团委书记以上及重点县区的全部干部配备齐全，平、津、保、唐、张、宣等大中城市，要注意配备建团干部，大力开展工作。青年工作干部不要经常变动。
    为了使干部能掌握建团方针，青年工作干部应经过短期训练。各级党委党校训练班中，设团的干部班，有计划、有步骤地把区以上干部加以训练，并有计划、有步骤地逐渐将约占党员数目百分之五到百分之十的青年党员，加以短期轮训后转入团，做为建团的骨干与基础。
    （四）建团步骤应有重点地推广，决不要平均主义地、没有重点地去建团。应首先从城市、工厂、学校及青年较集中、党的工作较好的大村镇开始，然后再求普遍的发展。
    应防止强迫拉夫单纯追求数字的错误作法；也要防止狭隘的关门主义，将一些先进青年拒绝于团门之外。
    在职工会中要逐渐建立青年部；在大的公营企业中，成立团委，并着手建团；在青工较多、党与工运工作较好的私营工厂中也应有重点地建团。
    在中等以上的学校普遍建团（步骤上仍应先作典型示范然后推广）。领导青年团是学校党委极重要的任务之一，并应注意改进学生会的工作。青年多的大机关中，亦应建立团的工作。
    在新解放的城市，应教育、改造、团结知识分子和青年学生，开展学生运动，协同工会发动青工，开展工人运动。在新解放区农村主要的是发动青年参加农民运动，建立一般青年组织，如农会青年小组、青年生产组、学习组等。
    已建立的青年团，应根据中央决定的精神加以巩固、整顿与发展。
    （五）华北局决定今年三月召开中国新民主主义青年团华北区第一次代表大会，选举中国新民主主义青年团华北区委员会及选举出席全国团代表大会的代表。目前重点县以上各级应成立团的筹委会，并及时召集各区党委的青年团代表大会，产生青年团的领导机关。
    为了指导华北青年团的工作，和组织广大青年儿童的学习，决定由华北青委出版青年儿童的刊物及各种通俗读物。各区党委应通过地方报纸出版青年副刊及青年读物。
    （六）各级党委接到本决定后应根据中央建团决议、团章草案等文件，召开会议，根据本地区青年情况和青运历史特点以及群众条件，定出具体工作计划，切实督促执行。执行过程中，亦须随时加以检查，并树立汇报制度。
