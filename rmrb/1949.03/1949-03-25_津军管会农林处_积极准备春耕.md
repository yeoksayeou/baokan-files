　　Tianjin Military Control Commission Agricultural and Forestry Department
    Actively Prepares for Spring Plowing
    [Tianjin Electric] The Tianjin Military Control Commission's Agricultural and Forestry Reception Department is actively preparing for spring plowing. The rice paddy area to be sown by the farms under the department this year will reach 177,118 mu. In order to sow in a timely manner, the department has established an Engineering Committee, which plans to complete the following repair projects by mid-April: (1) Dredge and repair 32 canals and ditches, with a total length of 62,900 meters. (2) Build 19 new bridges and repair 36. (3) Build 37 new sluice gates and repair 32. (4) Repair 25 culverts and build 7 new culverts. (5) Repair 21 pumping machines and water lifting machines. (6) Build 10 new water crossing pipes and repair 15. In addition to the above urgently needed projects, the department is actively repairing six electric motors at the Lutai Farm that were destroyed by the Chiang Kai-shek bandit troops. It is estimated that after the repairs are completed, the sown area of paddy fields can be increased by 45,000 mu. Considering that in the past the rice paddies of various farms were mostly controlled by landlords and rich peasants, and the peasants had to rent from the landlords and rich peasants, suffering heavy exploitation, and the distribution and rental were extremely unreasonable, the Agricultural and Forestry Department made appropriate rental adjustments to eliminate intermediate exploitation such as subletting and subtenancy. At the same time, in order to solve the difficulty of fertilizer for farmers to grow land, the department plans to purchase 10,090,128 jin of bean cake and 1,819,650 jin of fertilizer powder, and lend them to farmers in the form of in-kind loans and in-kind repayments, so that farmers can obtain timely planting and favorable conditions for a bumper harvest in the autumn.

　　津军管会农林处
    积极准备春耕
    【天津电】天津市军管会农林接管处积极准备春耕。该处所辖各农场今年播种稻田面积，将达十七万七千一百一十八亩。为及时播种，该处特成立工程委员会，计划在四月中旬完成以下几项几修工程：（１）疏修三十二条渠沟，共长六万二千九百公尺。（２）新建桥梁十九座，修理者三十六座。（３）新建闸门三十七个，修理者三十二个。（４）修理涵洞二十五个新建涵洞七个。（５）修理抽水机、扬水机二十一部。（６）新建过水筒十个，修理十五个。除以上急待完成之工程外，该处正积极修理芦台农场曾被蒋匪军破坏的六台电动机，预计修理完竣后，可增播种面积水田四万五千亩。农林处鉴于各农场稻田过去多为地主富农把持，农民再由地主富农手中租借，受到重重剥削，分配与租借极不合理，故作适当之租借调整，取消转租转佃等中间剥削。同时为解决农民种地肥料之困难，该处拟购买豆饼一千零九十万零一千二百八十斤、肥田粉一百八十一万九千六百五十斤，以贷实还实办法贷给农民，使农民获得及时耕种，秋后丰收的有利条件。
