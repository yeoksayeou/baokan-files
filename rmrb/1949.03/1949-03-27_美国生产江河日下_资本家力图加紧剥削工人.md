Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, March 25th: TASS, New York, March 23rd: The deteriorating economic situation in the United States is receiving increasing commentary from American newspapers. U.S. News & World Report writes: Currently, industrial and commercial activity in some sectors of the American economy is declining sharply. Compared with the high levels of post-war production, pre-war production has fallen by 11 percent, machine manufacturing by 7 percent, coal by 16 percent, and railway freight by 13 percent. New orders in industry have fallen by 12 percent. The decline in production has led to an increase in unemployment and greater exploitation of employed workers. U.S. News points out that due to the declining trend in production, industrialists want to reduce costs by shortening the work week, which allows them to cut weekly wages and avoid paying overtime. The decline in people's purchasing power has also caused a significant decline in the production of daily necessities. According to the magazine, the production of the shoe industry has fallen by 24 percent compared to its highest post-war level, wool production has fallen by 18 percent, and cotton consumption in the textile industry has decreased by 19 percent. Despite a great shortage of housing, housing construction has recently been cut in half. The magazine cites much existing material to prove that basic industrial sectors such as metallurgy and automobiles are also about to reduce production.

　　美国生产江河日下
  　资本家力图加紧剥削工人
    【新华社北平二十五日电】塔斯社纽约二十三日电：美国经济局势的恶劣正受到美国报纸的越来越多的评论，美国新闻杂志写道：目前美国经济中些某部门的工商业活动正急剧下降。战前的生产与战后的高度相比已下降百分之十一，机器制造下降百分之七，煤下降百分之十六，铁路货运下降百分之十三。工业中的新定货下降百分之十二。生产的下降造成了失业的增加和对受雇工人的更大的剥削。美国新闻指出，由于生产的日趋下降趋势，工业家要以缩短工作周来减低成本，这样能够使他们削减每周的工资，并免去支付加班工资。人民购买力的下降也造成了日用品生产的大大下降。据该杂志说，鞋工业的生产与战后的最高水平相比下降百分之二十四，毛织品的生产下降百分之十八，纺织业中棉花的消耗减低百分之十九，尽管房屋大感缺乏，房屋的建筑最近却削减了一半。该杂志引据许多现有材料证明，如冶金、汽车等基本工业部门也即将减低生产。
