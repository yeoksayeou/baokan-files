How Should Highway Transportation Be Managed?
	Xia Jingfan

	Since the liberation of Pingjin, the Ping-Shi and Shi-Jin highways have been repaired one after another, and the long-deserted transportation lines have become active again. At first, only state-owned passenger cars of the North China Transportation Company and the Tianjin Automobile Transportation Company were running. Subsequently, the commercial vehicles in Pingjin that had removed their tires to escape the stranglehold of Kuomintang bureaucratic capital also re-mounted their tires, resumed business, and participated in the operation. It is reported that there are more than 1,000 commercial vehicles in Pingjin, and about 80 have already been running on the Pingjin-Shijiazhuang line.

	These commercial vehicles are still using the old "hit-and-run" and "opportunistic" business methods. Therefore, congestion and disputes often occur on the Pingjin-Shijiazhuang line. Because the fares of commercial vehicles are not fixed, prices are arbitrarily asked and bargained, and the fares for passengers in the same car are unequal, sometimes differing by as much as 100%. Sometimes passengers communicate with each other, and disputes often occur with the vehicle owners. Furthermore, recently there have been more passengers and goods traveling from Pingjin to Shijiazhuang, and the freight rates of commercial vehicles are generally 20% to 50% higher than those of state-owned vehicles. There are fewer passengers and goods traveling from Shijiazhuang to Pingjin, and due to competition for passengers and goods, the freight rates are often 50% to 20% lower than those of state-owned vehicles. Commercial vehicles can make up for shortcomings in this way, while the fares of state-owned vehicles are calculated based on the cost of fuel per kilometer, and they must depart and arrive on time. They cannot be as flexible as commercial vehicles. Therefore, the North China Transportation Company has decided to abandon passenger transport on the Ping-Shi line to commercial vehicles, and the Tianjin Automobile Transportation Company has also adapted to the situation by temporarily charging 70% of the original fare for return trips from Shi to Jin (the fare from Tianjin to Shi is still 3 yuan per passenger kilometer) to facilitate passengers. However, in order to attract customers, these commercial vehicles still compete with each other. They entrust travel lodges or shopkeepers (and even street vendors in Pingjin) to sell tickets, giving them 10% of the ticket price as a commission, and park their vehicles in the areas with the most passenger traffic to solicit customers, resulting in violations of regulations and obstruction of traffic. At the same time, some vehicles have overturned due to selling too many tickets; some commercial vehicles have not departed on time due to selling too few tickets, causing disputes and even fights among passengers who are eager to travel; this has had a significant impact on passenger safety and traffic order.

	Based on the above situation, if it continues to develop unchecked, it will not only be a crisis for the private transportation industry, but also affect the development of the transportation business. Therefore, I would like to put forward the following preliminary opinions on the management of highway transportation for the reference of relevant authorities:

	　　　　Establish Road Maintenance Methods and Strengthen Highway Management.

	First of all, in terms of highway construction, there are currently no specific and sound road maintenance methods for how to maintain the repaired road surfaces and bridges. Public and private vehicles have not yet begun to pay the necessary fees for driving on the highways. After rain, in order to protect the integrity of the road surface, it is necessary to suspend traffic for a certain period of time, but the management has not issued a notice, and commercial vehicles have not implemented it. In order to prevent the highways that have been vigorously repaired by the people of various places from being damaged, and to have a regular income for road maintenance, commercial vehicles must pay road maintenance fees. The Highway Bureau should promptly handle the registration of commercial vehicle licenses in order to investigate all responsibilities in driving.

	The "road maintenance team" workers now number about one person per five kilometers in some places, and some places have almost none at all. As the roadbeds in North China are mostly earthen and easily damaged, the number of "road maintenance team" workers should be increased in a timely and appropriate manner, and mobile repair workers should be set up where necessary. The source of "road maintenance team" workers should be selected from the villages and towns along the road in conjunction with administrative appointments, and given appropriate treatment, so that they do not abandon agricultural and sideline production and can ensure that road repair and maintenance work is not delayed.

	In addition, for the sake of driving safety, more road signs should be set up at dangerous places along the road such as turns, downhills, and bridges, so that drivers can be vigilant and reduce the occurrence of accidents.

	　　　　Based on Economic Conditions, Unify Vehicle Allocation

	In order to develop the highway transportation business in a planned manner and effectively promote the comprehensive construction business in North China, the operation of public and private vehicles on each line should be based on the economic conditions of each line and the actual number of vehicles needed, which should be uniformly reviewed and allocated by the highway authorities.

	For the operation of commercial vehicles on a certain line, the commercial vehicle company should apply to the highway authority for registration. The Highway Bureau, in accordance with the principle of "prospering the economy and taking into account both public and private interests," should review whether the requested line is economically necessary before approving it, or let them change routes, so as to avoid unprincipled competition and unplanned operation among the same industry, which would cause confusion on the transportation lines.

	　　　　Establish a Unified Station and Strengthen Driving Management

	In order to make driving orderly, to provide convenience and safety for passengers, and to reduce the intermediate exploitation of travel lodges on commercial vehicles, the establishment of a unified station and the strengthening of driving management have become urgent tasks: vehicles must enter and exit through the station, and the station must be designated as the starting and ending point of driving; tickets should be sold centrally at the station, and passengers should get on and off the vehicle centrally, so that the public security organs can easily conduct inspections when necessary, and carry out tax inspection of incoming and outgoing goods; (because the tax inspection of transit goods has not yet been implemented, some shopkeepers in Shijiazhuang have now transferred to itinerant merchants in order to avoid paying taxes.) The issue of ticket prices should be based on the accurate calculation of fuel costs, and should be as consistent as possible, and the disparity should not be too great. Competition should only be carried out in terms of business and equipment, and should jointly serve the development of the economy.

	The station should take practical responsibility for the inspection of the vehicle itself, the driver's technical test, and the limitation of the load. It should also do its best to arrange the order of vehicles, appropriately adjust the business between companies, and solve the difficulties of parking and loading and unloading goods for vehicles entering the station. The station should have uniform regulations in these aspects.

	Furthermore, in the establishment of stations in various places in the future, attention should be paid to the economic conditions of the countryside, and the past practice of only setting up stations in cities and discriminating against the countryside should be overcome, so that passengers and goods in the countryside, even those along the transportation line, also need to be transported to the city to get on the vehicle. Now, based on the principle of strengthening urban-rural relations and attaching importance to cities without neglecting the countryside, stations should be added at appropriate locations in villages and towns along the transportation line, so that farmers can also enjoy the convenience of transportation.

　　公路交通应如何管理？
    夏景凡
    平津解放后，平石、石津两条公路相继修复，冷落已久的交通线又活跃起来。开始行驶的只是国营的华北交通运输公司及天津汽车运输公司的客运汽车，继后平津两地下掉轮胎逃避国民党官僚资本绞杀的商车也重新上起轮胎，恢复营业，参加行驶。据悉平津两地的商车达一千辆以上，已行驶平津石家庄线的就有八十辆左右。
    这些商车目前还是沿用着过去那一套“打野鸡”、“拉黄鱼”的营业办法，因此，平津到石家庄线上，时常发生拥挤和争执的现象；由于商车的票价没有规定：随意要价还价，同车旅客各人票价不等，甚至有相差一倍的；有时旅客之间互相谈通，往往与车商发生争执。再者，最近平津两地到石家庄的客货较多，商车运价一般高于国营的百分之二十到五十；石家庄赴平津的客货较少，由于争夺客货，运价常低于国营的百分之五十到二十。商车可以这样取长补短，而国营车辆的票价则接照每公里的油料成本计算，而且要按时开车按时到达，不能象商车一样机动；因此华北交通运输公司决定放弃平石线客运让与商车，天津汽车运输公司也适应情况将由石返津运价临时按七折收费（天津至石市仍按每客公里三元收费），以求便利旅客。但是这些商车为了招来顾客，仍然互相争夺，他们售票则委托旅栈或座商（平津两地甚至委托街头摊贩），给他们票价百分之十的手续费，并将车辆停放于旅客来往最多的地带进行兜揽，以致违反规则妨碍交通。同时有些车辆因为售票过多，发生翻车事件；有些商车因卖票过少，不按时开车，使已经上车的客人因急欲赶路发生争执，甚至斗殴；对旅客安全与交通秩序影响至巨。
    根据以上情况，若长此自流，不仅是私营运输业的危机，也影响了交通事业的发展。因此我把个人对公路交通运输的管理，提出以下几点初步意见，供有关机关研究：
    　　　　建立养路办法，加强公路管理。
    首先在公路建设方面，对已经修复的路面和桥梁应如何进行保养，目前尚无具体和健全的养路办法；公私车辆在公路上行驶迄未开始缴纳应有的负担；雨后为保护路面的完整，需要停驶若干时间，管理方面没有通知，商车也没有执行。为使各地人民大力修复的公路不至遭受破坏，而且经常有一笔收入养路，行驶的商车必须缴纳养路费；公路局并应及时办理商车牌照登记，以便清查行车中的一切责任。
    公路的“道班”工人，现在有些地方约合每五公里一人，有些地方甚至基本没有。按华北各线路基均为土质，易于损坏，“道班”工人应当及时酌量增加，并在必要的地方设机动的抢修工人。“道班”工人的来源，应在沿路各村镇结合行政上指定人选，给予适当待遇，使不脱离农副业生产又能保证不误修路护路工作为宜。
    另为行车安全计，应在沿路转湾、下坡、过桥等险要处，多设路标，以便司机警惕，减免意外事件发生。
    　　　　依据经济情况，统一车辆分配
    为了使公路交通事业有计划的发展，有效的推进华北全面的建设事业，公私车辆行驶各线，应依据各线经济情况，实际需要车辆若干，由公路当局统一审查与分配。
    对于某一路线商车的行驶，应由该商车公司申请公路当局登记，路局根据“繁荣经济、公私兼顾”的方针，审查所请的路线在经济上有无需要，再事核准，或让他们改换路线，以免同业间无原则的竞争，无计划的行驶，使交通线上发生混乱。
    　　　　建立统一车站，加强行车管理
    为了使行车有秩序，使旅客便利与安全，及减除旅栈业对商车的中间剥削，对于建立统一车站，加强行车管理已成刻不容缓的工作：车辆开出开进必须经过车站，并指定车站为行车的起终点；在车站上集中售票，集中上下车，使治安机关在必要时便于进行检查，和进出货物的税收检验；（由于转运货物尚无实行税收查验，石家庄现已发生座商为免于纳税而转移行商的情况。）票价问题应根据油料成本的精确计算，尽量一致，悬殊不应太大。只在业务与设备上展开竞争，共同为发展经济服务。
    车站上对车辆本身的检查，和司机技术的考验，与载重量的限制，均应切实负起责任。并尽量做到能以排列行车次序，适当的调整各公司间业务，并向进达车站的车辆解决停车和装卸货物的困难，这些方面，车站均应有统一规定。
    再对各地设立车站，今后应该注意到乡村的经济情况，克服过去只在城市设站，歧视乡村，使乡村的客货即如沿着交通线者，亦需运到城里上车。现在我们根据密切城乡关系，和重视城市又不轻视乡村的原则下，应在沿交通线的村镇选择适当地址，增设车站，使农民同样享受交通工具的便利。
