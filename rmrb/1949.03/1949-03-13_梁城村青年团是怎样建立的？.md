How Was the Youth League of Liangcheng Village Established?

　　Liangcheng Village, in Yangcheng’s First District, has a total of 209 young men and women between the ages of fifteen and twenty-five (accounting for 18.6% of the village population). A Youth Salvation Association had been established in the 31st year of the Republic of China, organized by compiling a roster. Although they led the youth in learning and organized theater troupes at the time, they did not pay attention to solving the practical problems of the youth, nor did they organize and educate them to participate in various production and social activities. In addition, the Party branch did not attach importance to the leadership of youth work, so the work of the Youth Association was merely a formality. In reality, for several years, the active young people of Liangcheng had been playing a vanguard role and promoting various movements and work. For example, in the land reform movement, more than 20 young activists emerged.

　　The youth work team arrived in Liangcheng last May and did not immediately propose the establishment of the New Democratic Youth League. Instead, they decided to identify active members in practical movements and carry out the work of building the League. Therefore, they first participated in the ongoing correction work in the village. When the “poor peasant line” error was made the winter before last, some young people, such as Ma Haifang, were involved in suspending, beating, and detaining people, which aroused dissatisfaction among the masses. In response to this specific problem, the youth work team convened a meeting of young activists to study solutions. Subsequently, a meeting of youth representatives and a youth congress were held for criticism and self-criticism. At the first meeting, Ma Haifang did not accept everyone’s criticism. It was not until the second meeting, with everyone’s education and help, that Ma Haifang realized his problems and mistakes and expressed his determination to correct them. The solution to this problem not only educated Ma Haifang but also educated everyone. As Hu Yun said, “Solving Ma Haifang’s problem gave me a great lesson.” Each village convened a youth meeting to conduct self-examination, transforming some bad habits of the youth that were divorced from the masses through practical education. In the correction work, the active members among the youth became even clearer. The work of establishing the New Democratic Youth League was first carried out among the active members. After introducing the establishment of the Youth League in other districts and explaining the significance of the Youth League, the youth activists automatically participated in deliberation and discussion. The young men got up before dawn to fetch water for their families, and the young women gathered together to participate in discussions about the "establishment of the League" early in the morning. During the discussion, everyone felt that it was necessary to establish such a youth organization and expressed that they would actively strive to join such a Youth League. As Xiao Dai said to Xiao Suo, "We have been militiamen for several years, and we were also active in the war, but we have not yet joined the Communist Party. This time, we must strive to join the Youth League. Once we join the League, we don't have to worry about joining the Communist Party." Xiao Shun also said, "The Youth Salvation Association is organized by age, which has great shortcomings. The Youth League is good, and we must work hard to join the League." After the deliberations matured, it was decided that 18 activists would go to the youth in each village to carry out propaganda and deliberation.

　　On the one hand, the eighteen youth activists publicized the significance of establishing the Youth League, the nature and tasks of the Youth League, and the conditions and procedures for joining the League in various villages. On the other hand, they united and organized seventy-three young men and women to participate in class division studies and to participate in the village's class division work. They studied at night and publicized the policies of class division in mutual aid groups during the day. As Lao Ji suggested, "Ma Youde was a member of the Red Spear Society and should be classified as a landlord." Youth Xuan Cheng explained to him according to the documents: "He does not work himself, but lives by exploiting others. He is originally a landlord, but it is not because he participated in the Red Spear Society that he should be classified as a landlord." Chunxi said, "Where there is no cinnabar, yellow soil is also valuable." Youth Changnian immediately retorted, "This kind of statement of yours is trying to wrongly accuse a few middle peasants! Fighting the middle peasants is also detrimental to the poor peasants." The fact that the landlord Ma Youde underreported his property and concealed his exploitation was also investigated by the youth Sanling and Xiaozhua. After the second list of revised components was announced, Yan Sanjiang, a young Party member, was used as the backbone to develop three League members. Later, Ma Xiaoshun was also developed, and the four League members democratically elected Yan Sanjiang as the group leader.

　　On September 9th, the admission ceremony was held at the elementary school. One hundred and twenty-six young men and women attended, and ten young men and women spoke freely, examining their own shortcomings and insufficient conditions for joining the League, stating that they would work hard to correct them in the future and strive to join the League. After the meeting, some young people also automatically combined to examine themselves.

　　After the establishment of the Youth League group, it called on the youth to actively participate in the Three Autumns movement. During the Three Autumns movement, they participated in mutual aid groups to harvest crops during the day, and organized themselves separately under the moonlight to cut grain stalks at night. Under the leadership of the Youth League group, more than 20 young people also made production plans. Guo Xiaoqiao, who was originally a loafer, was also influenced at this time and made a plan to apply fifty loads of manure to his one mu of land, cut twenty-four bundles of Geshao (Note: Geshao refers to artemisia and small tree branches, etc., which are used by farmers in mountainous areas to burn fertilizer), and also took time to sell vegetables. During this Three Autumns movement, seven male League members and three female League members were developed, adding to the previous four, there were fourteen people.

　　On the 18th, at the League members' meeting, Yan Sanjiang was democratically elected as the secretary of the League branch, and Ma Baosuo and Ma Xiaoshun were elected as members of the League branch. It was decided to hold the official establishment meeting of the League branch on the 20th.

　　On the day of the meeting, Yun Kuan was building a house, and his father urged him early in the morning to quickly carry two loads of water so that he could eat and go to the meeting.

　　The meeting was held at the Damao Temple in the east of the village. There were: 112 young men and women from this village, 34 masses, and 43 representatives from other villages, for a total of 189 people. At the meeting, League Branch Secretary Yan Sanjiang reported on the process of the establishment of the Youth League under the leadership of the village Party branch. He announced the list of League branch members and new League members. He pointed out that League members should not be arrogant, but should unite the youth to do a good job. He encouraged young people who had not joined the League to work hard and make progress, and that they would be able to join the League when they met the requirements. The new League members held an admission ceremony, explaining their motives for joining the League and hoping that everyone would give them more opinions.

　　The main experiences gained from the work of establishing the Youth League in Liangcheng are: it is necessary to be under the leadership of the village Party branch, with good young Party members as the backbone, relying on the active young people in various movements, and uniting the broad masses of young people; after deliberation, discussion, and study, and under the conditions of ideological maturity, improved awareness, and conscious demand to join the League, the first batch of Youth League members should be carefully absorbed. This is of great importance to the growth and development of the Youth League in the future.

### 梁城村青年团是怎样建立的？

　　梁城村青年团是怎样建立的？
    阳城一区的梁城村，十五岁到二十五岁的男女青年一共二百零九人（占全村人口百分之十八点六），在民国三十一年已成立了青救会，是用造名册的方法编起来的。当时虽然也领导青年进行学习，组织剧团；可是没有注意到解决青年的切身问题，也没有组织和教育他们参加各种生产，社会活动；加上党的支部对青年工作的领导上没有重视起来，结果青年会的工作只是一个形式。实际上几年以来，梁城的青年积极分子。在各个运动和工作中，是起着先锋作用和推动作用的。象在土地改革运动当中，就产生了廿多个青年积极分子。
    青年工作组去年五月到了梁城，没有马上提出建立新民主主义青年团，决定在实际运动中，物色积极分子，进行建团工作，所以先参加了村里正进行着的纠偏工作。前年冬天犯“贫农路线”错误时，由于有些青年如马海芳等吊、打、扣人，引起群众不满意。针对着这个具体问题，青年工作组便召开了青年积极分子会议，研究解决办法。接着又开了青年代表会和青年大会，进行批评和检讨。在第一次会上马海芳不接受大家的批评，直到第二次会上，在大家的教育和帮助底下，马海芳才认识了自己的毛病、错误，向大家表示要决心改正。这个问题的解决，不光教育了马海芳，也教育了大家。象胡云说：“解决马海芳的问题，给我大大地上了一课。”各闾都召开了青年会议作检查，从实际教育中转变了青年的某些脱离群众的坏作风。在纠偏工作中，对青年中的积极分子看得更明白了。就先在积极分子当中，进行这次建立新民主主义青年团的工作。当介绍了外区青年团建立的情况，讲明了青年团的意义以后，青年积极分子们都自动地来参加酝酿讨论，男青年们天不明就起来给家里把水担上，女青年们也一大伙的相跟上，清早起来参加关于“建团”问题的讨论。在讨论当中，大家都觉得建立这样一个青年组织是必要的，都表示自己要积极努力，争取加入这样的青年团。象小呆对小锁说，“咱们当了好几年民兵，那次参战也积极，可是还没有参加了共产党，这次可要争取参加青年团，入了团就不愁参加共产党啦。”小顺也说：“青救会是按年龄编起来的，缺点很大，青年团好，咱们一定要努力争取入团。”酝酿成熟以后，就决定由十八个积极分子，到各闾青年中去进行宣传和酝酿。
    十八个青年积极分子，一方面在各闾宣传建立青年团的意义、青年团的性质和任务、入团的条件和手续；一方面团结并组织男女青年七十三个人，参加划阶级的学习，并参加全村划阶级工作。他们晚上学习，白天在互助组里宣传划阶级的政策。象老计提出：“马有德当过红枪会，应该划成地主。”青年轩成就按照文件给他解释说：“他自己不劳动，靠剥削别人生活，本来就是地主，可并不是他参加过红枪会，才该划成地主。”春喜说：“此地无朱砂，黄土也为贵。”青年长年马上反驳他：“你这种说法是想叫错斗几户中农吧！斗了中农对贫农也是不利的。”地主马有德少报财产，隐瞒剥削事实，也叫青年三灵和小抓调查出来了。在改订成份二榜公布以后，以青年党员阎三江为骨干，发展了三个团员，后来又发展了马小顺，四个团员民主推选阎三江当组长。
    九月九号，在小学校举行入团仪式，到了男女青年一百二十六个人，有十个男女青年自由讲话，检讨出自己有哪些缺点，不够入团条件，今后要努力改正，争取入团。会后，也有些青年自动的结合在一块儿，检讨自己。
    青年团小组成立以后，就号召青年积极参加三秋运动。他们在三秋运动中，白天参加互助组收秋，黑夜单独组织起来在月亮底下割谷草。在青年团小组领导下，二十多个青年还订了生产计划，原来是二流子的郭小乔，这时受到影响也订了计划，把他的一亩地上了五十担粪，割了二十四捆圪梢（注：圪梢即蒿草小树枝等，山地农民用以烧肥料），还抽空卖菜。在这三秋运动中，又发展了七个男团员、三个女团员，加上以前的四个，就有了十四个人。
    十八号在团员大会上，民主推选了阎三江为团支部书记，马保锁、马小顺为团支部委员，决定二十号开正式成立团支部的大会。
    开会的那一天，云宽家盖房子，他父亲一早就催他赶快担上两担水，吃了饭好开会去。
    在村东大庙上开会，到会的有：本村男女青年一百一十二人，群众三十四人，外村代表四十三人，一共是一百八十九个人。在会议上，团支书阎三江报告在党的村支部领导下青年团成立的经过。宣布了团支部的委员和新团员名单。指出团员不要自高自大，要团结青年搞好工作。鼓励未入团的青年们要努力进步，够了条件就能入团。新团员们举行了入团仪式，说明自己入团的动机，希望大家多给他们提意见。
    从梁城建立青年团的工作当中，得出的主要经验是：一定要在党的村支部领导下，以好的青年党员为骨干，依靠各种运动中的青年积极分子，团结广大青年；经过酝酿、讨论、学习，在思想成熟，觉悟提高和自觉要求入团的情况下，慎重地吸收第一批青年团员。这样，对以后青年团的成长和发展有重大的关系。
