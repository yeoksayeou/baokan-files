　　Domestic and International Democratic Groups Send Congratulatory Telegrams to the Women's Congress
            All-China Federation of Trade Unions Congratulatory Telegram
    We are delighted to learn that the National Women's Congress is being held on March 24th in the ancient capital of Beiping. This is a victorious meeting of women from the liberated areas and women from the Kuomintang-controlled areas in the New Democratic Revolution, and it is a sign of unprecedented unity and progress among women nationwide. This meeting is of great historical significance.
    Chinese women have made brilliant contributions to the cause of the Chinese people's liberation. We believe that women across the country will continue their efforts, actively support the war, actively participate in all aspects of construction, and strive to completely smash the Kuomintang's conspiracy of false peace, to achieve the people's true peace and democracy, and to fight for the liberation of women nationwide and the liberation of all the Chinese people. We wish the conference a successful outcome.

    　　　National Student Federation Congratulatory Telegram
    Dear sisters, women representatives! After celebrating our own victorious meeting and holding the 14th Congress, and establishing our own unified organization—the All-China Students' Federation—we Chinese students warmly celebrate the convening of your first National Women's Congress. This is an unprecedented event in the history of the Chinese women's movement, and we cheer for your victory!
    The Chinese women's movement and the student movement have both gone through a long and arduous journey. In the struggle against imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism, we have fought side by side closely. Today, national victory is in sight, and the tasks ahead will be even more arduous. We should hold hands even more closely, and together with the people of the whole country, under the leadership of the great Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao Zedong, fight to completely overthrow the rule of American imperialism and the Kuomintang reactionaries in China, and to build a New Democratic Republic of China. We wish your conference success!

    　　　　Women's International Democratic Federation Congratulatory Telegram
    [This newspaper dispatch] The Women's International Democratic Federation recently sent a congratulatory telegram to the First National Congress of Chinese Women, the original text of which is as follows:
    The Women's International Democratic Federation, with fervent sentiment, celebrates the convening of the First National Congress of Chinese Women, and the imminent establishment of the Chinese Democratic Women's Federation. The Women's International Democratic Federation greatly admires and sympathizes with the Chinese people, who have always fought valiantly for freedom and liberation, especially the decisive role played by Chinese women in this liberation struggle, which is even more a source of pride. We pay our highest respects to the countless female heroes who sacrificed themselves in the liberation war.
    We know that the Chinese liberated areas have already eliminated the feudal system and completely expelled imperialist aggression. Therefore, the future New China will be a great and strong people's republic in world history. Chinese women are as heroic in the ongoing construction as they were in the liberation struggle, advancing shoulder to shoulder with their men.
    The Chinese representatives who attended the Women's International Democratic Federation meetings in Paris, Prague, and Budapest, especially Ms. Cai Chang, will work harder to improve the social and economic status of the working masses and enable them to participate on a large scale in the construction of New China, as well as develop the culture of the entire country.
    The establishment of the Chinese branch of the Women's International Democratic Federation demonstrates the vast development of the strength of democratic women around the world. The valuable experience of Chinese democratic women will provide great help in improving the lives of women and children in Asia and Africa. Chinese women occupy a very important position in the international community and also shoulder very important tasks. We have unlimited confidence in the Chinese branch. Long live the great Chinese democratic women! Long live the solidarity of democratic women around the world! Long live the Women's International Democratic Federation!
    Mrs. Gordon, Chairman of the Women's International Democratic Federation (signed)

    亲爱的全体妇女代表姊妹们：我们中国学生在庆祝了自己胜利的会师，举行了第十四届代表大会，成立了自己统一的组职——中华全国学生联合会之后，热烈地庆祝你们全国妇女第一次代表大会的召开。这是中国妇女运动史上的创举，我们为你们的胜利而欢呼！
    中国的妇女运动和学生运动，都是经过了长期艰苦的途程，在反对帝国主义，封建主义和官僚资本主义的斗争中，我们曾亲密地并肩作战。今天，全国胜利已经在望，而今后的任务将更艰巨，我们应当更紧密地携起手来，和全国人民一道，在伟大的中国共产党和毛泽东主席领导下，为彻底推翻美帝国主义及国民党反动派在中国的统治，为建设新民主主义的中华人民民主共和国而奋斗。敬祝你们大会成功！

    【本报讯】国际民主妇女联合会顷电中国妇女第一次全国代表大会致贺，原文如下：
    国际民主妇女联合会，以热烈的心情，庆祝中国妇女第一次全国代表大会的召开，以至中国民主妇女联合会的即将成立。国际民主妇联，对一向为自由解放而英勇斗争的中国人民，十分景仰与同情，尤其对于中国妇女在这次解放斗争中所起的决定性作用，更引以为荣，对于牺牲在解放战争中无数女英雄，谨致崇高的敬礼。
    我们知道中国解放区，已经消灭了封建制度，完全驱逐了帝国主义的侵略。因此今后的新中国，将是世界史上一个伟大而强壮的人民共和国。而中国妇女对正在进行的建设事业，也是和参加解放斗争同样英勇，和她们的男子同样并肩前进。
    出席巴黎、布拉格、布达佩斯所召开的国际民主妇联的中国代表们，特别是蔡畅先生，将会更加努力提高工农大众的社会地位和经济地位，使他们大规模地参加新中国的建设事业，以及发展整个国家的文化。
    国际民主妇联中国分会的成立，是表现了世界民主妇女力量的广大发展。中国民主妇女的宝贵经验，将给予改善亚非两洲妇女与儿童生活以绝大助力。在国际间，中国妇女占着极重要的地位，同时也肩负着极重大的任务。我们对中国分会，抱着无限大的信心。伟大的中国民主妇女万岁！全世界民主妇女团结万岁！国际民主妇女联合会万岁！
