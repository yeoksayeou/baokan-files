[Chahar News] The entire workforce of the state-owned Xuanhua Paper Mill is engaged in resumption of production and construction with a new work ethic. To prevent power waste, workers voluntarily installed electricity meters. Wang Yutang, who used to carry four furnace bricks at a time, now carries thirty-six. During the construction of the South Courtyard staff dormitory, masonry, earthwork, miscellaneous tasks, and carpentry workers launched a competition. The original plan required ten people to work for thirty-five days, but with the workers' soaring enthusiasm, only six people worked each day, completing the entire project in thirteen days. A junior clerk, Wang Deming, braved heavy snow for two days and one night to collect belts and copper mesh, completing the task and saving more than 100,000 yuan. When making the doors and windows for the South Courtyard dormitory, the original plan required hinges, locks, and so on. After Wang Baohua's research, wooden pivots were used instead, saving six hundred door and window hinges, one hundred and forty door locks, and one hundred and forty handles, saving a total of 14,640 yuan at the then market price. The copper mesh used for the beater's washer and the adhesive filter is expensive and difficult to buy. The military representative personally led the workers to pick out a large pile of old copper mesh from the broken brick pile. This was something that had not been used for several years. After research by workers such as Yin Shike, the mud and dirt were removed by boiling with caustic soda, then washed with water, and connected with solder for use. Currently, 400.56 square feet of sixty-two mesh copper mesh and 21.47 square feet of fourteen mesh copper mesh have been assembled, saving a total of 85,000 yuan according to the Tianjin market price on March 5th. The factory did not have welding mirrors during machine repairs, and they could not be bought locally. Liu Haishan learned how to make welding mirrors during the Japanese occupation, but he had always been unwilling to do so. Now that he is liberated, he realizes that the factory is his own, so he actively tries to make them. After two days of research and four failures, he succeeded in the fifth attempt, and it was the same as buying one. Now he is researching welding rods. During the machine inspection, the water pump installed by the former Japanese, Takahashi, could not draw water with a thirteen-meter pipe, but Wang Xize repaired it in one day. Major problems such as the blower not blowing air and the pulley center line of the drying cylinder being twelve o'clock off were also repaired by Liu Haishan, Yang Tianzhao, and Cao Yongxin.

  　赶工节约恢复工厂
    王德明冒雪寻机件节省十余万元
    【察哈尔讯】公营宣化造纸厂全体职工，以新的劳动态度从事复工建设。为防止浪费电力，工人自动安了电表。王玉堂过去殿砖每趟搬四个，现在搬三十六个。修建南院职工宿舍时，泥瓦、土、杂、木等工掀起竞赛。原计划每天十人须做三十五天，但在工人高涨的劳动热忱下，每天只六人，做了十三天就全部完工。小职员王德明，为了搜集轮带和铜网，冒大雪找了两天一夜，结果完成任务，节省人民币十余万元。做南院宿舍的门窗时，原计划须用合页、门锁等，经王宝华研究改用木轴，节省门窗合页六百个，门锁一百四十套，拉手一百四十个，按当时市价，共节省人民币一万四千六百四十元。打浆机之洗涤器及粘料过滤器所用之铜网，价钱高，不易买，军事代表亲自带领工人，在破砖堆里拣出了一大堆旧铜网，这是好几年不用的东西，经尹世考等工友研究，用火碱煮去泥垢，再用水洗净，用焊锡接起来使用，现在已凑成六十二目铜网四零零点五六平方英尺，十四目铜网二一点四七平方英尺，按天津三月五日的市价，共合节省人民币八万五千元。该厂在修理机器中，没有电焊镜子，本地又买不到。刘海山在日本侵占时，就学会做电焊镜子的，但他一直不肯做。现在解放了，他认识到工厂是自己的了，便积极试作。研究了两天，做坏了四次，第五次试做成功，和买的一样。现在他正研究电焊棍。在机器检查中，原日人高桥安装的水泵，十三米的管子不能吸水，现在王喜泽一天便修好了。吹风机不能吹风、烘缸的皮带轮中线错了十二时等大毛病，也经刘海山、杨天兆、曹勇信修好。
