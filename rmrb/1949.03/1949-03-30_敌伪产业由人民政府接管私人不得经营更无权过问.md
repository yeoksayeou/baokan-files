　　Enemy and Puppet Industries Taken Over by the People's Government, Private Individuals May Not Operate, Much Less Interfere

　　Question: I used to be a field technical instructor at the pseudo-North China Light Metal (i.e., aluminum factory) between Zhangdian and Nanding on the Zhangbo branch line of the Jiaoji Railway in Shandong. The factory had just been completed when the Japanese invaders surrendered, and the factory also stopped working, and all the workers changed their professions. Now I have the following questions, please answer: (1) After the Japanese invaders surrendered, the factory was taken over by the pseudo-Resources Committee and renamed Shandong Aluminum Company, but it was only in name. Can we check this file as a basis for our work, or can your group check it for us; (2) I heard that trade union representative conferences have been established in various industrial circles. How is this conference organized? Should we submit it to the Military Control Commission for registration? Has the Zibo mining area established a trade union? Is the aluminum company also under the jurisdiction of the Zibo mining area? What procedures should be used to handle the representatives of the trade union? Is there a fixed number of representatives? (3) Can the past technicians of the factory post a notice to register by correspondence in order to count the number of people? (4) What procedures should civil servants go through if they wish to participate in production work?
　　Deng Qianxi, Clerk, Fourth Section, Finance Bureau of the Beiping People's Government

　　Answer: (1) Since the factory belongs to the pseudo-Resources Committee, it is an enemy and puppet industry, and it should now be taken over by the Shandong People's Democratic Government. Private individuals may no longer operate it, much less interfere or post notices to count the old technicians. (2) The trade union representative conference is a mass organization of the workers themselves in a factory or enterprise, and is led by its superior trade union. The method of its establishment is to elect workers with work and production experience, ability, prestige among the masses, and who can seek welfare for the workers as representatives through democratic elections by all the workers of the factory or enterprise, according to groups or work units. There is no fixed number of representatives, and it is determined according to the specific situation of each factory. (3) If the original civil servants are willing to participate in production work, they can formally apply to their own agency for approval, hand over their work clearly, and then they can be assigned, and there are no other procedures.

　　敌伪产业由人民政府接管私人不得经营更无权过问
    问：我过去曾任山东胶济路张博支路张店南定间伪华北轻金属（即制铝工厂）现场技术指导员。该工厂甫告完成，日寇投降，工厂亦停止工作，所有工人均行政业。现有下面几个问题，请答复：（一）该工厂于日寇投降后为伪资源委员会接收，易名山东制铝公司，但有名无实。我们是否能查此卷做为进行基础或贵组代查；（二）闻各工业界成立有职工代表会，该会是如何组织？是否由我们呈军管会办理登记手续？再是否淄博矿区已成立职工会？该制铝公司是否亦列于淄博矿区管辖？职工会代表人用何种手续进行办理？代表人名额是否有一定额数？（三）该厂过去技工人员，可否登报以通讯方式报名，以便于统计人数？（四）公务员如愿参加生产工作如何办理离职手续？
    北平人民政府财政局第四科办事员邓乾熙
    答：（一）该工厂既属于伪资源委员会，为敌伪产业，现在应为山东人民民主政府所接管，私人不得再加经营，更无权过问或登报统计旧技工人员。（二）职工代表会是工厂或企业中职工自己的一种群众性的组织，受其上级工会领导，产生的办法是由该工厂或企业的全体职工，经民主选举的方法，按组或工作单位选出工作、生产上有经验有能力、在群众中有威信能为职工谋福利的职工为代表所组成。代表人的名额没有一定，根据各厂的具体情况决定。（三）原有公务员愿意参加生产工作，可呈请本机关正式批准，将工作交待清楚，即可听凭分配，别无其他手续。
