　　People's Bank of China Tianjin Branch
  　Launches Commodity-Denominated Deposits; Deposit Amounts Increase Daily
    Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, March 15th. The Tianjin Branch of the People's Bank of China has begun offering commodity-denominated savings deposits this month. Deposits and withdrawals are calculated based on "standard commodity units," and interest is also calculated in commodities. Each "standard commodity unit" includes one *jin* of Hengzi vermicelli, one *chi* of Red Five Blessings cloth, and one *jin* of cornmeal, and is converted to cash based on the average price of these items for the five days prior to the deposit or withdrawal. However, if, at the time of withdrawal, the price of commodities has fallen and the cash equivalent is insufficient to cover the original principal, the bank will still pay the original principal and interest will accrue as normal.
    Tianjin, March 17th. The commodity-backed savings deposits offered by the Savings Department of the Tianjin Branch of the People's Bank of China have been praised by factories, schools, organizations, and the general public. The number of deposit units and the amount of deposits are increasing daily. From the 1st to the 5th of this month, there were a total of 6,544 units deposited, amounting to 538,981.73 yuan; from the 7th to the 12th, this increased to 37,261 units, amounting to 3,169,074.8 yuan, almost a sixfold increase. Representatives of the Shoufeng Flour Company in the city reprinted the bank's savings regulations, distributed and posted them, and promoted the benefits and methods of saving to the workers. More than forty workers at the @ Sheng Flour Mill sold a portion of the cornmeal they received daily and deposited it in the department.
