Xinhua News Agency, East China, 19th: The East China Field Army's Third Health Work Conference concluded successfully on the 6th of this month after lasting for half a month. The conference summarized the army's health work over the past two and a half years and determined the direction for future improvement. In the unprecedented People's Liberation War, the East China Field Army established a set of injury treatment institutions suitable for large-scale modern warfare, and learned and carried out battlefield treatment work. One-third of the wounded treated in combat have returned to their units after recovery. In addition, more than 6,000 health cadres have been trained and cultivated, solving the needs of the army's great development. However, among the health workers, there is a purely technical point of view, and there is also a more serious waste of materials. In light of the above situation, the conference formulated various work systems and regulations as one of the methods to strengthen discipline in future work. Li Zhenxiang, Minister of Health of the Field Army, pointed out in his speech that the main direction of efforts in future health work is to strengthen the political study of technical cadres, improve the level of political theory, and strengthen the mass viewpoint in technical work.

　　华野召开卫生会议
    决定卫生工作方向
    【新华社华东十九日电】华东野战军第三届卫生工作会议，历时半月，已于本月六日圆满结束。会议总结了两年半全军卫生工作并定出了今后改进工作的方向。在空前规模的人民解放战争中，华东野战军建立了一套适合大规模近代作战的救伤机构，学会并开展了战场治疗工作。战斗中救治的伤员已有三分之一伤愈归队。另外，又训练和培养了六千多名卫生干部，解决了部队的大发展的需要。但在卫生工作人员中存在着单纯技术观点，对于物品材料的使用，也有较严重的浪费现象。会议根据上述情况，特制订了各种工作制度与工作条例作为今后加强工作中纪律性的方法之一。野战军卫生部长李振湘在发言中指出今后卫生工作中的努力方向，主要是加强技术干部的政治学习，提高政治理论水平，加强技术工作中的群众观点。
