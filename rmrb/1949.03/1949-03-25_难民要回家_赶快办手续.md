　　Refugees Want to Go Home
    Hurry Up and Complete the Procedures
    [Report from this newspaper] Since the Beiping Municipal People's Government's Civil Affairs Bureau started providing free train rides home for refugees, very few people have come to collect introduction letters due to insufficient publicity. Therefore, the Civil Affairs Bureau has consulted with the Railway Bureau and agreed to extend the validity period to March 31st. It has also notified the working groups in various districts to promptly persuade refugees to return home. The criteria for reviewing refugee applications will be relaxed slightly, procedures simplified, and travel permits can be used as exit permits. Refugees remaining in Beiping must complete the procedures for returning home at their respective district governments within the specified time; applications will not be processed after the deadline.

　　难民要回家
    赶快办手续
    【本报讯】平市人民政府民政局自办理难民免费乘车回家以来，由于宣传不够，前来领取介绍信的甚少，民政局乃与路局商妥，延长有效期至三月三十一日止。并通知各区工作组及时劝告难民回家。对于申请难民之审查，尺度稍为放宽，手续简化，路条即可当作出境证。几留平难民，须按期到各区政府办理回家手续，逾期不再办理。（琪）
