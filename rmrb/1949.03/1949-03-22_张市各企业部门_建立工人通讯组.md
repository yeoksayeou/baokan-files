　　Zhangjiakou City Enterprises and Departments
　　Establish Workers' Correspondence Groups
　　[Zhangjiakou News] The enterprises and departments in Zhangjiakou have now mostly established workers' correspondence groups, and have absorbed a large number of worker correspondents. According to statistics from only five units, including the Ping-Sui Railway Branch Bureau, the Water Company, the Power Plant, the Enterprise Company, and the No. 1 Flour Company, more than 160 worker correspondents have been developed. After the establishment of worker correspondence groups in various units, they can actively write articles for their newspapers. For example, the worker correspondence groups of the Rubber Factory and the Electricity Management Bureau of the Enterprise Company are now writing one article per person per week. According to the statistics of the Ping-Sui Railway Branch Bureau's employee correspondence group from February to March 15th, a month and a half: 96 correspondents wrote 188 articles. The main reasons why workers' correspondence groups in various units can be quickly established and correspondents actively write articles are: (1) The trade unions of various enterprises and departments have included the establishment of workers' correspondence groups on their agenda. For example, Comrade Di Feng of the Propaganda Department of the Ping-Sui Railway Branch Bureau's Trade Union, in order to quickly establish workers' correspondence groups, first started publishing wall newspapers, using active writing employees as the backbone, and formed correspondence groups among employees of various units at the end of January. (2) Resolved the ideological concerns of correspondents who generally believed that "their cultural level is low and it is difficult to write articles." To this end, the Electricity Management Bureau held a symposium to specifically explain what to write and how to write, etc. At the same time, through discussion, everyone also realized that writing articles for the party newspaper can promote and improve work. Therefore, in the last week of February, all eight members of the group wrote one article each. In one week in mid-March, more than ten articles were received. The worker correspondence group of the locomotive section of the Ping-Sui Railway Branch Bureau also initially thought that writing articles was difficult. With the personal help of the Propaganda Department of the Trade Union in revising and collecting materials, many articles were published. After the publication of worker Tu Wenhe's article, all the correspondents in the group said: "Writing articles is not as difficult as we thought before!" In a few days, the whole group wrote six articles. (3) Combining writing articles with wall newspapers has consolidated the writing enthusiasm of correspondents. After various units published wall newspapers regularly, the trade union would copy good articles and give them to the newspaper, which further encouraged everyone's writing enthusiasm. For example, since the telecommunications section correspondence group of the Ping-Sui Railway Branch Bureau issued wall newspapers, the number of articles has increased day by day. When the first issue of the wall newspaper was published, more than 20 articles were received, and the number of articles in the second issue increased to more than 30. Now, various units are further expanding the correspondence organization, preparing to absorb workers who actively write articles for wall newspapers to join the correspondence group. Various departments have also decided that starting from the end of this month, each correspondence group will hold a symposium once a week to study how to improve writing methods, and prepare to conduct collective creation.

　　张市各企业部门
    建立工人通讯组
    【张垣讯】张家口各企业部门，现已大部建立起工人通讯组，大量吸收了工人通讯员。仅据平绥铁路分局、自来水公司、发电厂、企业公司、第一面粉公司等五个单位统计，现已发展工人通讯员一百六十余名。各单位工人通讯组成立后，都能积极为自己的报纸写稿。如企业公司橡胶厂、电力管理局等单位的工人通讯组，现在一星期每人写稿一篇，仅平绥铁路分局职工通讯组二月至三月十五日一个半月的统计：九十六名通讯员，就写稿一百八十八件。各单位工人通讯组能迅速建立和通讯员积极写稿的主要原因是：（一）各企业部门职工会，把建立工人通讯组列入了议事日程，如平绥铁路分局总工会宣传部迪风同志为迅速建立工人通讯组，首先着手出版壁报，以写稿积极的职工为骨干，于一月底在各单位职工中组成了通讯组。（二）解决了通讯员普遍存在着认为“自己文化水平低，写稿难”的思想顾虑。为此，电力管理局特召开了一次座谈会，专门讲解了写什么、怎样写等问题，同时经过讨论，大家也认识了给党报写稿可推动、改进工作的作用。所以二月份最后一周全组八人每人写稿一篇。三月中旬一周即收到稿件十余件。平绥铁路分局机务段工人通讯组，开始也认为写稿难，在总工会宣传部的亲自帮助修改和收集材料下，不少稿件披露了，如工人屠文和的稿件发表后，全组通讯员都说：“写稿并不象以前咱们想的那样难呀！”几天工夫全组就写了六篇稿。（三）写稿与墙报结合，巩固了通讯员的写稿情绪。各单位定期出版了墙报后，凡是好的稿件，职工会就抄一份交给报社，这更鼓舞了大家写稿情绪，如平绥铁路分局电务段通讯组自出墙报后，稿件日益增多，出版第一期墙报时收稿二十多件，第二期稿件就增至三十多件。现各单位正进一步扩大通讯组织，准备吸收积极给墙报写稿的工人加入通讯组。各部门并决定从本月下旬开始，各通讯组每周开一次座谈会，研究如何改进写稿方法，且准备进行集体创作。
