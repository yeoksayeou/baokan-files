　　Another Treacherous Crime of the Kuomintang
  　Opening Wuzhou as a Foreign Trade Port - Kuomintang-Controlled Shipping Industry Voices Opposition
    [Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 15th] The Kuomintang reactionary government decided on the 23rd of last month to open Wuzhou, a port on the Xijiang River in Guangxi, as a foreign trade port. This matter has met with opposition from the shipping industry in the Kuomintang-controlled areas. The China Merchant Ship Drivers Association, the United Association of Maritime Drivers, the Marine Engineers Association, the Ship Radio Operators Association, and the Songhu District Pilots Association and other groups sent a telegram to the Kuomintang government on the 12th of this month, denouncing this move as cutting off Xijiang's navigation rights, allowing imperialist economic aggression to penetrate further into the interior, and demanding the cancellation of this decision.
