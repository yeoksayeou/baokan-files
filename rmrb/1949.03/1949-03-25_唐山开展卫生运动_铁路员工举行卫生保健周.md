　　Tangshan Launches Hygiene Campaign
    Railway Workers Hold Health Week
    [Tangshan Dispatch] Tangshan is launching a spring hygiene campaign, with factories, mines, government offices, and citizens actively participating. Earlier this month, the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau, in conjunction with the Chamber of Commerce, convened a meeting of over 200 representatives from various industries citywide to specifically discuss citywide hygiene and epidemic prevention measures. The meeting emphasized the hygiene management of restaurants, hotels, bathhouses, vegetable markets, meat markets, and entertainment venues. After the meeting, cadres from various district and street offices mobilized citizens to remove garbage and clean streets. In the Third District, some 700 households cleaned the main streets and alleys of the entire district thoroughly within seven days. The Municipal Medical Association and Physicians Association cooperate with district governments weekly to inspect residents' hygiene and epidemic diseases. Eleven physicians, divided into six groups by district, go out twice daily, accompanying district cadres to guide and inspect citizens' cleaning work house by house, and diagnose diseases for citizens. Those with serious illnesses are sent to hospitals for treatment. The Railway Bureau gathered more than ten units, including stations, sections, factories, and offices in the Tangshan area, to discuss the health of all employees and their families, as well as the cleanliness of their residences. It was decided to hold a Spring Health Week from the 13th to the 19th. Special attention is being paid to station hygiene. In recent days, during breaks in train operations, waiting rooms have been washed with water, and areas around the buildings and corners have been disinfected. The Railway Bureau's affiliated railway hospital is responsible for leading the promotion of employee health and work within the bureau.
