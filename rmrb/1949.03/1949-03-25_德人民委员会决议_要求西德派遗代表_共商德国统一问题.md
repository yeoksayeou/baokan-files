　　German People's Council Resolution
    Demands West Germany Send Representatives
    To Discuss German Unification

    【Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 23rd】 Telegraphic News from Berlin by Electric News Agency: The Sixth Session of the German People's Council passed a resolution on the 19th, demanding the formulation of principles for a peace treaty based on the Yalta Agreement and the Potsdam Agreement. The resolution calls for the restoration of German administrative and economic unity; the implementation of a unified currency system nationwide, the abolition of trade restrictions between the occupation zones; the establishment of a democratic provisional central government of Germany; and the convening of a peace conference, which should be attended by representatives of the German provisional democratic government. The German People's Council has once again invited various political parties in West Germany to send representatives to discuss the issue of restoring German unification with representatives of the People's Council. However, this invitation has once again been rejected. Communist members of the West German Parliamentary Council have requested an emergency meeting of the Parliamentary Council to discuss the invitation from the German People's Council.
