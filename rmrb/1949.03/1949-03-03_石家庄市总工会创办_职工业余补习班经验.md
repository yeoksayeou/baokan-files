　　Shijiazhuang City Federation of Trade Unions Creates
  　Experience in Workers' Spare-Time Tutoring Classes
    Li Zhong
    The Shijiazhuang City Federation of Trade Unions started a spare-time tutoring class for workers before the New Year, mainly to explain the resolutions of the Labor Congress. Eighty-seven people attended the class, including twenty-five union chairmen, thirty committee members, and thirty-two group leaders and activists. Originally, classes were scheduled for every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday, but due to the approaching New Year, it was changed to once a day, from 7 pm to 9 pm. Although the weather was very cold, and we even encountered snowy days, everyone's enthusiasm was still good. In particular, units such as the North China United Factory, the Automobile Repair Factory, and the New China Tobacco Company, although eight or nine li away from the Federation of Trade Unions, were able to arrive on time. Qin Yongqing, an old worker from the Fanrong Factory and current deputy director of the branch, was never late once in half a month. The tutoring class was held eight times, conveying the main parts of the Labor Congress resolutions. But overall, the results were not great. At the summary meeting, the students unanimously reflected: "The lectures are good, and it's energetic to listen to, but as soon as the class is over, we can't remember what was said." Based on the students' opinions, the first tutoring class had the following shortcomings: First, the Labor Congress resolutions contain a lot of content, and it is difficult to explain them deeply and specifically in only a dozen hours. As a result, we could only make principled explanations according to the original text, which did not solve the problems. However, the students came to listen to the lectures in order to get solutions to the difficulties encountered in the work of their units from the Labor Congress resolutions. As a result, everyone felt that they had not gained much. Second, the method of only lecturing without discussion was not good. Originally, we felt that there was too little time and were afraid of not finishing the lectures, so we stipulated that each teacher should lecture for two hours and then let each unit go back to discuss. In reality, everyone lives scattered, and it is difficult to organize discussions outside of class. As a result, before the students had time to raise questions they didn't understand, a new class was already being taught, and they couldn't digest it. Third, no lecture outlines were distributed, and everyone lacked a written reference. Reading the original resolutions was too difficult, so they had to rely on memorizing, which is the easiest to forget. Another shortcoming was that there were too many different teachers. Eight classes were taught by five teachers. The teacher lecturing this time did not know what was lectured last time, so repetition or omissions were inevitable. Finally, everyone felt that: the tutoring class is very good and must continue to be held, and suggested focusing on things related to the current work of the trade union, fixing the teachers, compiling teaching materials, and changing the time to one hour of lecture and one hour of discussion every day.
    On January 10th, the second tutoring class officially started. The first two lectures were on the New Year's message from Xinhua News Agency, "Carry the Revolution Through to the End." Then we talked about the labor protection part of the Labor Congress resolutions, using the "Provisional Regulations on Wartime Labor Insurance" published in the Northeast as reference material, and linking it to the actual situation in the city. Some questions have been preliminarily raised: such as "How to calculate seniority? Should it be counted if one changed factories or worked for the enemy and puppets before liberation?" "What items should be included in the medical expenses for work-related injuries and illnesses? What kind of procedures should be followed for sick leave to be appropriate?" "Is it too little to issue one month's salary for the burial expenses of employees who die of illness?" etc. We are also preparing to organize the differences of opinion caused in the classroom and publish them in the newspaper, and bring them up to the congress of representatives. As a result, the students are very interested, and there are more speeches than before. Many people take notes during lectures and discussions, and some even bought the "Labor Congress Resolutions" booklet compiled and printed by the North China Federation of Trade Unions to take back and read.
    In giving lectures to employees, we have initially gained a few experiences. First, it must be linked to reality. The documents are mostly principled resolutions, and the concrete things that employees often come into contact with and request to be resolved are all concrete matters, so we must help them analyze and study these concrete problems, and check them according to the spirit of the resolutions, and finally summarize them to the principles, so that the students' thinking and understanding will be improved. If only abstract clauses are taught, and they are not integrated with the things in their minds, everyone will feel empty and boring. Second, don't be greedy, only talk about one center per class. At the beginning, explain the main points of the paragraph clearly, then use concrete examples to illustrate, and make a brief outline to summarize at the end of the class. In this way, the students will have a clear understanding of the problem after listening. Several times, because the teacher was not well prepared, he talked about labor protection issues, then about the relationship between workers and factories, and then about the organizational law of cooperatives, which made the students "a fathom-tall Buddha - unable to figure it out." Third, you must speak and write at the same time, speak and ask questions at the same time, and write the outline on the blackboard. Especially when encountering uncommon terms, be sure to give a popular explanation. After explaining a paragraph, ask questions in the lecture hall, which is very effective. As for discussing issues, it can be used flexibly. If there are many people, divide them into groups, and if there are few people, combine them. Because it is a spare-time tutoring class, it is better to discuss in the classroom, where everyone's energy is concentrated. After going back, everyone has some private affairs, and it is difficult to gather together, so they will disperse. Fourth, you must speak clearly and be lively. Employees like to listen to interesting and story-like things the most, and they don't like to sit there quietly and listen to flat lectures. This point must be taken care of when lecturing, so that the classroom is not too quiet. It is also necessary to learn some songs during the break to adjust the air.

　　石家庄市总工会创办
  　职工业余补习班经验
    李钟
    石家庄市总工会，年前办了个职工业余补习班，主要讲解劳大决议案。听课人数八十七个，其中包括二十五个工会主任、三十个委员，还有三十二个小组长和积极分子。原来规定每逢星期一、三、五上课，后因年节将到，即改为每天一次，时间在晚上七点到九点，虽然天气很冷，又曾遇到下雪天，大家情绪却还不错，尤其是华北联合工厂、汽车修理厂、新中国烟草公司等单位，虽离总工会有八九里远，却都能准时到课，繁荣厂老工人秦永清，现任分会副主任，半个月中没有迟到过一次。补习班一共上了八次课，传达了劳大决议的主要部份。但总的检讨起来，成绩还不大，在总结大会上，学员们一致的反映是：“讲的不错，听着也有劲，只是一下课就记不起讲的是什么了。”根据学员们的意见，第一期补习班有以下几个缺点：第一、劳大决议内容很多，只凭十几个钟头，难于讲得深刻具体，结果只有照原文作原则的阐明，解决不了问题。而学员来听课，目的是想从劳大决议中得到解决本单位工作中遇到的困难，结果，使大家感到所得不多。第二、光讲不讨论的办法不好。原来我们觉得时间太少，怕讲不完，就规定每次由教员讲两个钟头后，让各单位回去讨论。实际上大家分散居住，课外组织讨论很困难，结果学员有不明白的地方，还没来得及提出，新的课又讲了，消化不了。第三、没有发讲授提纲，大家缺少个书面东西做参考，看原决议案又太深，只好凭脑子硬记，最容易忘掉，还有个缺点是教员换的太多，八次课五个教员，这次讲课的不知道上次讲的是什么，免不了有时重复或遗漏。最后，大家认为：补习班很好，一定要继续办下去，并提出着重讲和目前工会工作有关的东西，固定教员，编印教材，时间改为每天讲课一个钟头，讨论一个钟头。
    一月十日，第二期补习班，又正式开课了。头两次讲的是新华社新年献词“将革命进行到底”。接着讲劳大决议中的劳动保护部份，以东北发表的战时暂行劳动保险条例为参考材料，联系本市实际情况，现已初步提出一些问题：如“如何计算工龄？跳过厂子或解放前给敌伪做工应不应算工龄？”“因公负伤、疾病的医疗费，应包括那些项目？告病假要经过怎样的手续才合适？”“病死的员工发一个月工资的埋葬费是否太少？”等。并且还准备把课堂上所引起的分歧意见，整理出来报纸上发表，并提到代表大会上去。这样一来，学员们都很感兴趣，发言比前普遍了，许多人听课和讨论时都做笔记，还有的买了华北总工会编印的“劳大决议案”小册子拿回去读。
    在给职工讲课中，初步得到几点经验。第一、必须和实际联系。文件上大都是原则性的决议，职工们经常接触和要求解决的又全是具体事情，因此就要帮助他们把这些具体问题加以分析研究，根据决议的精神来检查，最后总结到原则上去，才会使学员的思想和认识提高一步。如果只讲抽象的条文，和他们脑子里的东西不融合，大家就会感到空泛乏昧。第二、不要贪多，每次课只讲一个中心。开头把本段的要义讲清，随后拿具体例子阐明，临下课时再总括起来做出扼要的提纲。这样学员听完后，对问题的了解是清晰的。有几次因为教员准备的不充分，讲起来忽儿是劳动保护问题，忽儿是工人和工厂的关系，又扯到合作社的组织法，弄得学员们“丈八的佛爷——摸不着头。”第三、必须连说带写，连讲带问，把纲要写到黑板上。特别是遇到不常见的术语名词，一定要给以通俗的解释。讲完一段后，即在讲堂发问，很起作用。至于讨论问题，可灵活运用，人多就分组，人少就合着，因为是业余补习班，所以在课堂讨论比较好，大家精力集中。回去后谁都有点私事，很不容易集合，就会流散。第四、必须口齿清楚，生动活泼。职工最喜欢听有趣味性故事性的东西，不爱静坐在那里听平板的训话。这一点在讲课时得照顾到，尽可能使课堂不要太沉静。休息时学学歌子，调剂一下空气也是必要的。
