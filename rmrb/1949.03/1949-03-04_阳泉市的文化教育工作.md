　　Cultural and Educational Work in Yangquan City
　　[This Newspaper] (News) With the restoration of the coal and iron industry and the improvement of people's lives, cultural and educational work in Yangquan City has developed greatly in the past ten months. The people of the city suffered greatly under the continuous devastation and exploitation of the Japanese invaders and Yan's bandits for more than ten years, and they were unable to afford to send their children to school. In addition, the severe drought of the year before caused most children around the age of ten to participate in production to survive the famine. At that time, almost all school education in the city collapsed. In the past year, under the leadership of the Communist Party and the democratic government, full use has been made of various natural production conditions to organize coal and iron industry and sideline production. Not only has the famine been overcome, and people's lives have been greatly improved, but school education has also developed accordingly. According to statistics from October of last year, one school per village has been achieved, covering a population of more than 70,000 men and women. In Yangquan City, which has 61 administrative villages, 60 primary schools and 3 higher primary schools have been restored, with a total of 5,572 male and female students. In order to train teachers, the city mobilized intellectuals in the countryside to participate in the new democratic education. Last year, a short-term training class for teachers was held during the autumn vacation. The focus was on instilling the new education policy and new teaching methods, transforming their ideology and work style. As a result of the training, 83 teachers were assigned to work. According to an inspection of the city's education work before the new year, the fourth district performed well. The district organized district and village-level propaganda and education committees composed of responsible persons from district and village Party, government, and mass organizations to promote education, which has achieved great results. District cadres also conduct inspections and supervision at any time when they go to the countryside. The proportion of school-age children attending school in the district has increased from 30% to over 60%. Among them, the number of students in six villages such as Zhangjiayu and Sandu has tripled compared to the beginning of the school year. In addition, primary schools in many villages have more seriously implemented regular systems such as class arrangement according to ability, teaching according to curriculum progress, roll call attendance, and performance assessment. Each sub-district also has a central primary school, where teachers compete with each other in teaching. Every three months, primary school students from various villages go to the central primary school for a joint examination, and teachers also insist on a daily study system of two hours.
　　The "Yangquan Municipal Vocational School," established before last autumn, in addition to the original five classes in industry and mining, accounting, and teacher training, added cooperative (society) classes and trade classes in January this year, enrolling 285 new students. At the same time, 115 graduates of the school's short-term training courses were assigned to work in factories, horse farms, economic, cultural, and educational departments.
　　In terms of education for workers and citizens, the city established a mass education center in March last year. According to statistics before the new year, more than 800 books have been purchased successively. Students and industrial workers borrow the most books, followed by citizens and businessmen. In the autumn of last year, the city's Federation of Trade Unions published a typeset workers' newspaper once every seven days, and workers in various mines and factories can read the newspaper for free. Many workers write articles for the newspaper. At the end of last year, Sanhe Factory took the lead in establishing a school for workers' children, with 73 workers' children attending school for free. The factory then established a workers' spare-time school, offering classes according to different production units and different working hours. The learning content is based on "The Chinese Revolution and the Chinese Communist Party" and the resolutions of the National Labor Congress as teaching materials. Attention is also paid to explaining current events.
　　Although cultural and educational work has achieved the above-mentioned results in Yangquan City, since the city is an industrial and mining area, the education of workers is very important. At present, except for Sanhe Factory and the state-run textile factory, which have strengthened worker education in a relatively planned manner, workers in other private mines and factories receive very little education. The worker's study in some state-owned mines and factories is also mostly a formality. Therefore, the trade unions and Party committees of various mines and factories should quickly strengthen this work.　　(Lü Guangming)

　　阳泉市的文化教育工作
    【本报讯】随着煤铁业的恢复，人民生活改善，阳泉市文化教育工作，在近十多个月来，有很大发展。该市在日寇、阎匪连续十余年的摧残压榨下，人民生活十分困苦，无力供给子女上学。加上前年的严重旱灾，凡十岁左右的儿童，多数参加生产渡荒。当时全市学校教育，几全部垮台。一年来在共产党及民主政府的领导下，充分的利用了各种自然生产条件，组织煤铁业与副业生产，不但战胜了灾荒，人民生活得到大大改善，学校教育也随之发展。据年前十月间统计，已作到一村一校，包括男女七万多人口。六十一个行政村的阳泉市，恢复到六十座初级小学校、三座高小，共男女学生五千五百七十二名。该市为培养师资，曾动员在乡知识分子参加新民主主义的教育，去年利用秋假开办了教员短期训练班。着重的贯输新教育方针与新的教学方法，改造他们的思想作风，训练结果八十三名教员分配了工作。根据年前该市教育工作检查，以第四区为好，该区以区村党、政、团体各负责人，组织了区村两级的宣教委员会来推动教育，收效宏大。区干部下乡也随时作到检查督促，该区学龄儿童就学者由百分之三十增加到百分之六十强，其中如张家峪、三都等六个村，现有学生人数，较开学时竟增加到三倍，此外不少村的初级小学校更认真的执行了按程度编班，按课程进度授课、点名考勤、考核成绩等正规制度，各小区并设中心小学一座，教员们互相比赛教学，每三个月各村小学生到中心小学举行一次会考，教员们也坚持了每天两小时的学习制度。
    该市去秋前成立的“阳泉市立职业学校”除原有的工矿、会计、师资等五班外，今年一月又增了合作（社）班、贸易班，招新生二百八十五名，与此同时，该校短训班有一百一十五名毕业学员，分配到工厂、马场、经济、文教等部门内担任工作。
    在职工、市民教育方面，去年三月，该市成立了民众教育馆，年前统计，已陆续购买到八百余本书籍。借书者以学生、产业工人为最多，其次是市民与商人。去年秋天，市总工会出版了七天一次的铅印职工报，各矿厂职工们，可以免费看报。不少职工为该报写稿。三合厂于去年底，首先成立了职工子弟学校，现有七十三个工人子女免费就学，该厂继又成立了职工业余学校，按不同生产单位，不同工作时间，分班授课。学习内容以“中国革命与中国共产党”和全国劳动大会的决议为教材。并注意到讲解时事。
    文化教育工作，在阳泉市虽有上述成绩，但因该市系工矿区，职工教育工作十分重要，目前该市除三合厂、公营纺织厂，作比较有计划的加强职工教育外，其他一些私营矿厂、工人很少受到教育，有些公营矿厂的职工学习，也多迫于形式，因之各矿厂职工会、党委会极应迅速加强这一工作。　　（吕光明）
