It participated in World War II and was already a decommissioned warship in the United Kingdom due to its age. The British government gifted the ship to the Chinese Kuomintang government on February 24, 1948. In order to receive the ship, the Kuomintang government sent students to study in the United Kingdom in 1945. The ship arrived in China in late July 1948 and became the only excellent warship of the Kuomintang Navy. The officers and soldiers of the ship, opposing the Kuomintang government's traitorous and anti-civil war reactionary policies, mutinied on the 24th of last month and sailed the ship to the Liberated Areas.

　　重庆号巡洋舰介绍
    【新华社沈阳二十四日电】上月二十四日在吴淞口起义而于本月十九日被炸毁的巡洋舰重庆号，重七千余吨，全长五百零五英尺，宽五十一英尺，马力六万四千匹，最高航程每小时三十海里，续航里四千海里。舰上装有六英寸口径重炮六门，四英寸口径山炮八门，高射平射两用机关炮八门，高射机关枪八挺，鱼雷发射管六门，及雷达设备、防雷设备等。该舰系于一九三五年六月至一九三六年九月建造于英国朴茨茅斯，曾参加第二次世界大战，因舰龄过老，在英国已为退役军舰。英国政府于一九四八年二月二十四日将该舰赠予中国国民党政府。国民党政府为了接收该舰，曾于一九四五年派遣学生赴英国学习。该舰于一九四八年七月下旬始开抵中国，成为国民党海军的唯一优良兵舰。该舰官兵因反对国民党政府的卖国和内战的反动政策，故于上月二十四日起义，将该舰驶来解放区。
