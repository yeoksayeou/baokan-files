Xinhua News Agency, Beiping, February 27th: General Lin Biao, Commander of the Northeast People's Liberation Army, spoke at the welcome meeting for democratic personages on the 26th.

　　Gentlemen, Comrades:

　　Today, we are holding such a large-scale and solemn meeting in Beiping to welcome democratic personages from all sides, which is of great significance. Those attending today include representatives of various democratic parties, groups, and non-party人士 from the Kuomintang areas who have overcome various difficulties to come to the liberated areas, as well as representatives of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, farmers from the liberated areas, national student groups, national women's groups, and ethnic minorities. This shows that the Chinese revolution is approaching its final victory, and demonstrates the greatness and unity of the Chinese people's democratic forces. The gentlemen who have come from the Kuomintang areas have long carried out democratic struggles under the persecution of the Kuomintang government, and have persisted in and expanded the democratic movement in the Kuomintang areas. The democratic movement in the Kuomintang areas is a powerful coordination for the war and struggle of the military and civilians in the liberated areas. We express our admiration and warm welcome to the democratic personages who have come here from the Kuomintang areas and various liberated areas.

　　The issue that you and the entire Chinese people are most concerned about today is the issue of peace. Regarding this issue, many gentlemen have expressed many good opinions, and our Chinese Communist Party is also making unremitting efforts to achieve true peace for the whole of China. I believe that the issue that the entire Chinese people need to solve today is not whether or not to have peace, but the issue of true peace versus false peace, and the question of what method to use to achieve true peace. The "peace" that the Kuomintang reactionaries are playing with today is proposed when the counter-revolutionary and evil civil war they launched has almost resulted in a complete military defeat. Everyone knows that the Kuomintang reactionaries have no sincerity for peace. Two years and eight months ago, the Kuomintang, disregarding the peace wishes of the CCP and the people of the whole country, disregarding Chairman Mao's personal visit to Chongqing after Japan's surrender in 1945, disregarding the Double Tenth Agreement, the ceasefire agreement, and the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference, and disregarding the repeated warnings of the Chinese Communist Party, launched this war with the support of American imperialism. However, as a result of the war, the Kuomintang has lost approximately five million troops on various battlefields across the country. The Kuomintang has suffered a complete defeat on all fronts north of the Yangtze River, and it is no longer possible to organize any strategic battlefields south of the Yangtze River. They no longer have the strength to wage major wars. It was long ago assured that the Kuomintang was bound to fail, but the speed of their failure exceeded our expectations. In the Northeast, we annihilated 470,000 Kuomintang troops in the fifty-two days of operations in the autumn and winter of last year. On the Huaihai battlefield, we annihilated 600,000 enemy troops in sixty-five days. The liberation of North China was also faster than we had anticipated. The Kuomintang reactionaries today not only have no offensive power militarily, but also have no systematic defensive power. They are politically and economically torn apart. Under such circumstances, under the instructions of American imperialism, they pretend to seek "peace." They attempt to deceive the people of the whole country with this, to stop the People's Liberation Army from advancing south of the Yangtze River, to buy time for a military breather in order to reorganize their forces and launch a counterattack. They also attempt to organize so-called "opposition派" within the democratic camp to undermine the unity of the democratic forces. Therefore, the "peace" they are striving for is to maintain the interests of the reactionary forces, for the interests of war criminals, which is detrimental to the people of the whole country. However, today, with the level of awareness of the people of the whole country greatly improved, the reactionary派's "peace" conspiracy cannot succeed. The so-called "opposition派" conspiracy will also fail.

　　The peace that the people of the whole country demand is the people's peace, not a peace like that of the Northern and Southern Dynasties. That is to say, all eight conditions of Chairman Mao must be fully implemented, the reactionary forces must be thoroughly destroyed, power must be handed over, and all reactionary armies must be reorganized. Such peace is beneficial to the Chinese people. Our Chinese Communist Party and the People's Liberation Army, in close contact with the people of the whole country, have completely sufficient military strength to wipe out all reactionaries in the country in a short period of time and fully implement Chairman Mao's eight conditions. However, in order to reduce the destruction of war and preserve the people's manpower and material resources as much as possible, we are adopting methods of peaceful resolution. The peaceful resolution of the Beiping issue is a successful example of this method. The peaceful resolution of the Beiping issue was successful primarily because, after the complete liberation of the Northeast, the People's Liberation Army won victories in Zhangjiakou, Xinbaoan, and Tianjin in North China, coupled with the joint efforts of the people inside and outside the city of Beiping, and General Fu Zuoyi's recognition of the situation and his decision not to put up a futile resistance.

　　We warmly welcome the Beiping style of peace; for any reactionary forces who refuse to accept the Beiping method of achieving peace, we will have to resolve it in the Tianjin way. We welcome you gentlemen to help us achieve a Beiping style of peace south of the Yangtze River. Today, with Chiang Kai-shek's main force completely annihilated and the remaining forces not much, it can be said that the stage of large-scale war nationwide has passed, and it is impossible to have a huge scale of war south of the Yangtze River. In the five major liberated areas of Northeast, North China, East China, Central Plains, and Northwest, large-scale construction work has begun or is preparing to begin. In the near future, after true peace is achieved south of the Yangtze River, construction will also begin quickly. The purpose of our revolution is to benefit the people's construction. Destruction is to remove obstacles to construction, which is a necessary and unavoidable means in the revolutionary process. Our Chinese Communists, in the process of destroying the old China, because they have united the entire Chinese people, will soon be able to liberate the whole of China. In the future, we will work together with all democratic classes, democratic parties, democratic personages, and the people of the whole country to engage in nationwide construction politically, economically, and culturally. Because the Liberation War has not yet completely ended, the primary task of construction at present is still to strive to support the front, while at the same time improving the people's lives as much as possible, and laying the foundation for future systematic and nationwide construction. In the past, you have made many contributions in the struggle against Japanese imperialism, American imperialism, and the Kuomintang reactionaries, and I hope that you can make more contributions to the cause of building a new China. I wish you all good health.

　　林彪将军在欢迎民主人士会上讲话
    江南匪已无力组织大战
  　欢迎照北平方式解决问题
    【新华社北平二十七日电】东北人民解放军司令员林彪将军在二十六日欢迎民主人士大会上的讲话。各位先生，各位同志：
    今天我们在北平开这样大规模的，这样隆重的欢迎各方民主人士大会，意义很重大。今天到会的，有由国民党区经过种种困难来到解放区的各民主党派、团体与无党派人士的代表，也有全国总工会、解放区农民、全国学生团体、全国妇女团体与少数民族的代表。这说明中国革命已接近于最后胜利，说明中国人民民主力量的伟大与团结。从国民党区来的诸位先生，过去长期在国民党政府的迫害下进行过民主斗争，坚持与扩大了国民党区的民主运动。国民党区民主运动对于解放区军民的战争与斗争是一个有力的配合。我们对于由国民党区与各解放区来此的民主人士，表示钦佩与热诚的欢迎。
    诸位和全中国人民今天最关心的问题是和平问题。关于这一个问题，许多先生发表过许多好意见，我们中国共产党也正在为了实现全中国真正的和平作坚持不懈的努力。我觉得全中国人民今天要解决的问题，不是要不要和平的问题，而是真和平与假和平的问题，以及用什么方式取得真正和平的问题。国民党反动派今天所玩弄的“和平一，是在他们所发动的反革命的万恶的内战已几乎全军覆没的情况下提出的。国民党反动派之向无和平诚意，尽人皆知。两年又八个月以前，国民党不顾中共与全国人民的和平愿望，不顾一九四五年日本投降后毛主席亲访重庆，不顾双十协定、停战协定与政协决议，不顾中国共产党的再三警告，在美帝国主义支持下，发动了这次战争。但是，战争的结果，国民党在全国各战场上已丧师约五百万。国民党在长江以北已全线溃败，在长江以南，也已不可能组织什么战略的战场，他们已没有大的力量进行大的战争。国民党必败，这是我们早已肯定了的。但他们失败之快，则出我们意料之外。在东北，去年秋冬季作战五十二天之内，我们消灭了国民党军四十七万。在淮海战场上，我们在六十五天内消灭了敌军六十万。华北的解放，也比我们的预料要快。国民党反动派今天在军事上不但已无进攻力量，也没有系统的防御力量了。他们在政治上、经济上都已四分五裂了。在这样的情形下，他们在美帝国主义指使下，伪装起“和平”来。他们企图以此欺骗全国人民，停止人民解放军向长江以南进军，争取军事上的喘息时间，以便重整旗鼓，进行反攻。并且企图在民主阵营内组织所谓“反对派”，以破坏民主力量的团结。因此，他们所争取的“和平”，是为了维持反动势力的利益，是为了战犯们的利益，对全国人民是不利的。但是，在全国人民觉悟程度已经大大提高的今天，反动派的“和平”阴谋是不能成功的。所谓“反对派”的阴谋，也同样要失败。
    全国人民所要求的和平，是人民的和平，不是南北朝式的和平。就是说，必须全部实现毛主席八个条件，必须彻底摧毁反动势力，必须交出政权，必须改编所有反动军队。这样的和平，才是对中国人民有利的。我们中国共产党与人民解放军，在与全国人民密切联系的条件下，有完全足够的军事力量，在短期内扫平全国一切反动派，全部实现毛主席的八项条件。但是，为了减少战争的破坏，尽量多保存人民的人力物力，我们正在采用和平解决的方法，北平问题的和平解决，就是这一方法的成功榜样。北平问题和平解决之所以能够成功，首先当然是由于人民解放军继东北全部解放之后，在华北又取得张家口、新保安和天津的胜利，加上北平城内外人民的共同努力，和傅作义将军之认清形势，未作无谓的抵抗。
    我们热烈欢迎北平式的和平；对于不肯接受北平方式实现和平的任何反动势力，我们就只好用天津方式来解决。我们欢迎诸位先生帮助我们在长江以南实现北平方式的和平。在今天蒋介石的主力已全部歼灭，剩下的力量已不多的情况下，可以说全国大规模战争的阶段已经过去了，长江以南，已不可能有巨大规模的战争。在已经解放的东北、华北、华东、中原和西北五大解放区，已经开始或准备开始大规模的建设工作。在不久将来，在长江以南，实现了真正和平之后，也将很快地开始建设。我们革命的目的，就是为了有利于人民的建设。破坏是为了扫除建设的障碍，是革命过程中所必须的而又是不得已的手段。我们中国共产党人在破坏旧中国的过程中，由于团结了全中国人民，不久将来即可以解放全中国。今后，更将与全国各民主阶层、民主党派、民主人士及全国人民一道，在政治上、经济上、文化上，从事全国规模的建设。由于解放战争还未完全结束，目前建设的首要任务，仍是努力支援前线，同时应尽可能改进人民的生活，并为以后系统的、全国性的建设打下基础。各位过去对于反对日本帝国主义与美国帝国主义，以及反对国民党反动派的斗争中，曾经有很多的贡献，希望在建设新中国的事业中能有更多的贡献。敬祝诸位健康。
