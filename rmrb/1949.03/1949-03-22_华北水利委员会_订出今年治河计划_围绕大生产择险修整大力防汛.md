North China Water Conservancy Commission
    Sets This Year's River Management Plan
    Focusing on Large-Scale Production, Selectively Repairing Dangerous Sections and Vigorously Preventing Floods

    [Our Newspaper's Report] The North China People's Government Water Conservancy Commission, based on the region's manpower, resources, and river conditions, has adopted the principle of selectively repairing dangerous sections and vigorously preventing floods, and has determined this year's river management plan. The Yellow River embankment restoration project in the Hebei-Shandong-Henan area will be based on a standard of one meter above the flood level of the 26th year of the Republic of China (1937), requiring a total of 2,967,504 cubic meters of earthwork, with a work section length of 238.46 kilometers; consolidation and renovation of 67 dangerous works, and 978 stone revetments. For small rivers within the territory, such as the Zhao Wang, Zhao Niu, Yangjiao, and Jin Di, vigorously mobilize and organize the masses to carry out partial dredging to reduce the area of flooded land. For lakes such as the Yellow River, the Grand Canal, and Nanyang Lake, properly repair the embankments.
    In the Taihang area, the Qin River project will complete the Dafan closure and repair a portion of the remaining dikes and dangerous works (the Dafan closure has already started). After the closure, not only can 120 villages in the three counties of Wuzhi, Xiuwu, and Huojia be spared from floods and more than 400,000 mu of cultivated land be restored, but it can also alleviate the disaster situation on the Wei Canal.
    In the South Hebei area, the Wei Canal embankment is being restored in three sections, with a length of 29,970 meters, and 35 dangerous works are being repaired. The Zhang River is strengthening its north bank, with an initial plan to do 863,572 cubic meters of earthwork. The Fuyang River and its tributaries are being repaired and their incomplete sections are being dredged, with a focus on dredging; a sluice gate will be built in Yongnian to use the Yongnian depression to store part of the floodwater, which can also generate income from fishing and reeds.
    In the Central Hebei area, the Qianli Dike, the Hutuo River, and the left bank of the Ziya River will remain the key points of defense. The Grand Canal and Jiedi, and the Machang diversion canal, which have been controlled by the enemy for many years, have suffered damage and disrepair to their embankments. There are plans to renovate these with a focus, and complete the unfinished Shibei River project (this river originally belonged to the Bohai area of Shandong, and includes projects such as transforming the riverbed's longitudinal slope and control gates) to discharge the accumulated water in the Qianqing depression and regulate the water volume of the Jiedi diversion canal. Other rivers such as the Zhulong, Daqing, Juma, Zhao Wang, and Fuyang will have selective construction of dangerous works and partial embankment restoration and dredging. Preliminary statistics show that a total of 4,136,992 cubic meters of earthwork is required, with a work section length of 436.76 kilometers, and 153 dangerous works will be repaired (the Yongding River, having only recently been liberated, is not included).
    In the East Hebei area, the Wangjia Fabao breach of the Luan River will be closed, so that more than 100 villages in Luannan and Luanxian can be spared from floods and more than 200,000 mu of cultivated land that has not been harvested for four years can be restored. The Yang (Jia Banqiao) and Liu (Gu) New Canals will be dredged for 20 kilometers to drain the accumulated water from 160,000 mu of land in the Lincang Taihe West Depression. The dikes of the Ji Canal, Arrow Canal, Five Rivers, Zhou River, Gou River, Yi River, Ronghui, and Lanquan Rivers will be repaired, with a total length of 217,359 meters.
    Currently, river management organizations in various regions are carrying out construction surveys, material preparation, and mass mobilization. Construction is expected to begin successively in mid-April.

　　华北水利委员会
    订出今年治河计划
    围绕大生产择险修整大力防汛
    【本报讯】华北人民政府水利委员会根据全区人力物力及河流形势，本择险修整大力防汛的方针，确定了今年的治河计划。冀鲁豫区黄河工程复堤以高出民国二十六年洪水位一公尺为标准，共须做土方二、九六七、五○四立方公尺，工段长二三八·四六公里；巩固及增修险工六十七处，石埽坝九七八道。境内各小河如赵王、赵牛、羊角、金堤等，则大力发动组织群众，加以部分疏浚，减少淹地面积。黄河南南运河、南阳湖等湖泊，则适当培修堤防。
    太行区沁河工程，完成大樊堵口及修复一部残堤险工（大樊堵口现已动工），堵口后不仅可使武陟、修武、获嘉三县一百二十村免除水灾，恢复耕地四十余万亩，且可减轻卫运河灾情。
    冀南区卫运河复堤三段，长二九、九七○公尺，修险工三十五处。漳河加强北堤，初步计划做土方八六三、五七二立方公尺。滏阳河及其支流修补残缺，重点疏浚；并在永年修泄水闸，利用永年洼，分储一部洪水，并可收渔苇之利。
    冀中区仍以千里堤、滹沱河及子牙河左堤为防守重点，南运河及捷地，马厂减河，多年被敌控制，堤防残破失修，计划有重点的修整，并完成石碑河未完工程（此河原属山东渤海区，计有改造河床纵坡，节制闸等工程），以泄千顷洼积水及调剂捷地减河水量。其他潴龙、大清、拒马、赵王、滏阳等河，择要修筑险工及一部复堤疏浚，初步统计共须做土方四、一三六、九九二立方公尺，工段长四三六·七六公里，修险工一五三处（永定河解放不久，未计在内）。
    冀东区修堵滦河王家法宝决口，使滦南滦县一百多村免受水灾，恢复四年未收的二十多万亩耕地。疏浚杨（家板桥）、柳（沽）新渠二十公里，以宣泄林仓太和西洼十六万亩土地的积水。修补蓟运箭杆五河、周河、沟河、沂河、荣辉、兰泉等河堤，共长二一七、三五九公尺。
    现各地区治河组织，正进行施工测量、备料、组织群众等工作，四月中旬即可先后动工。
