　　Building Shijiazhuang into a New-Style Industrial City
　　--Shijiazhuang Daily Editorial Celebration
　　[Another Dispatch] The Shijiazhuang Daily published an editorial entitled "Celebrating the Opening of the First Representative Conference of Workers in this City," stating: "Shijiazhuang has been liberated for one year and four months. Through the efforts of the people of the city, especially the workers, we have gradually transformed this city from a semi-colonial and semi-feudal consumer city under the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang to a people's democratic production city. We must continue to work hard to develop the liberated productive forces, build Shijiazhuang into a new-style industrial city, so as to support the front, carry the revolution through to the end, and lay the foundation for larger-scale industrial construction in the future." The editorial then put forward eight major issues related to the construction of Shijiazhuang and the interests of all workers for all representatives to discuss: 1. Summarize the experience of the labor movement in the past year and more, find out the basic lessons, and correctly implement Chairman Mao's general line and policy of "developing production, promoting economic prosperity, taking into account both public and private interests, and benefiting both labor and capital." 2. The most glorious page in the history of the labor movement in the past year and more is the large-scale production competition launched by the city's workers to compensate for war preparedness losses. Summarize the experience of this competition, apply it to future production, and prepare to launch a larger-scale production competition. 3. In order to better develop production, it is necessary to further implement the democratization of enterprise management, improve the existing factory management committees, convene worker representative meetings in large enterprises, and further improve the relationship between the Party, government, and labor union. 4. In accordance with the resolutions of the North China Industry and Commerce Conference, implement labor social insurance and appropriately improve worker welfare. 5. In the labor movement in private industries, we should continue to mobilize and organize workers and shop assistants to jointly develop private industry and commerce that is beneficial to the national economy and the people's livelihood under the principle of benefiting both labor and capital. 6. Hold various possible studies suitable for the needs of workers and the production environment, improve the political, cultural and technical level of workers, and cultivate a large number of worker cadres. 7. Call on all workers in the city to enthusiastically participate in the upcoming democratic elections in the city. Elect outstanding workers to governments at all levels to strengthen the leading role of the working class in the government. 8. Elect the official leading body of the city's workers -- the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions.
　　[Chahar News] In order to summarize the experience and lessons of the labor movement in Chahar Province since its liberation, elect representatives to attend the North China Workers' Congress and discuss proposals, the preparatory committee of the Chahar Provincial Federation of Trade Unions recently issued a notice, scheduled to convene the first provincial workers' congress in Zhangjiakou on April 20.
