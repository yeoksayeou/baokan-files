[Zhangjiakou Electric] Farmers in ten villages in ChengGuan, Chicheng County, Chahar Province, held a spring plowing mobilization meeting with more than 1,200 men and women from the entire ChengGuan area on the 17th of last month. The meeting summarized the production work in the later period of winter, judged the good and bad, mobilized for spring plowing preparation, and determined five tasks. The ten villages in ChengGuan held a meeting last November. At that time, the production plan set according to the production conditions of each village was: to develop various productions, and each person should produce two dou of rice to prevent spring famine. It was specifically mentioned that women should make and sell three pairs of shoes each in winter, which can produce three dou of rice. In addition to the original mills, 17 new mills should be opened, and various small productions should be made to avoid using autumn grain, and 26 more draft animals should be purchased. Within three months until the 17th of last month, great achievements have been made, and some villages have exceeded the prescribed tasks. The ten villages originally had twelve grinding mills and four oil mills. Twenty-six new grinding mills, one oil mill, and three basket shops were added, exceeding the original plan. The original number of cattle, horses, donkeys, and mules was 75, and 45 livestock were added in three months. The best was Nanda Village, which accumulated more than 2,100 carts of fertilizer in one winter. This year, each mu can be fertilized with three carts of manure. The original two grinding mills were planned to increase by two, but six were added. The original eight livestock were planned to increase by two, but twelve were added. Eighty-nine women made and sold 215 pairs of shoes, earning more than 5,200 jin of naked oats, more than four dan of various grains, and more than 1,400 firewood bundles. The village's sideline business developed very well, and the preparation for spring plowing was grasped very tightly. After everyone's evaluation, it was considered that Nanda Village's production was the best, and it was awarded the model banner. Finally, each village proposed five preparations to be made before spring plowing: (1) Chop firewood for spring plowing before the thaw, and send the manure to the fields. (2) Repair farm tools, plow the land once, and fertilize each mu with three carts of manure to avoid planting on unfertilized land. (3) Continue to develop sideline production to prevent summer famine. (4) Cadres should personally be responsible for the plowing work for the families of revolutionary martyrs and soldiers. (5) Great efforts should be made to transform the lazy people, urging and mobilizing them to participate in labor. Each village issued challenges to each other to ensure the completion of the above tasks, prepare for spring plowing, and strive to become a model.

    【张垣电】察省赤城县城关十个村于上月十七日召开了全城关男女群众一千二百余人的准备春耕动员大会，总结了冬季后期的生产工作，评判好坏；进行了准备春耕的动员和确定了五项工作。城关十个村在去冬十一月开了大会，当时按各村生产条件订的生产计划是：发展各种生产，按人口每人要生产二斗米防备春荒。特别提到妇女在冬季里每人做卖鞋三双，能生产米三斗，除原有磨坊外增开磨坊十七座，做各种小生产作到不动秋天粮，还要添购耕畜二十六头。到上月十七日三个月的时间内，获得很大成绩，有的村超过规定的任务。十个村原有碾磨坊十二家、油坊四家，新添碾磨坊廿六座、油坊一座、筐铺三座，超过了原计划。原有牛、马、驴、骡共七十五头，三个月添购了牲畜四十五头。最好的是南大村一冬天积肥二千一百车余，今年每亩能上到三车粪，原有碾磨坊二座计划增加两座却增加了六座，原有牲口八头计划增加二头，却增加了十二头，八十九个妇女，做卖鞋二百一十五双，挣下莜麦五千二百多斤，各种粮食四石多，打下柴禾一千四百多个，该村副业发展的很好，对春耕准备工作抓的很紧。经过大伙的评议认为南大村生产搞的最好，得到了模范旗。最后各村提出春耕前做好五项准备工作：（一）在开冻前把春耕时的烧柴打好，把粪送到地里。（二）修理好农具，地要耕一遍，每亩要上三车粪、争取不种白茬地。（三）继续开展副业生产，防备夏荒。（四）干部亲自负责做好烈军干属的代耕工作。（五）对懒汉要下大力量改造，督促动员他们参加劳动。各村互相提出挑战保证完成上面几项工作，把春耕准备好，争取当范模。
