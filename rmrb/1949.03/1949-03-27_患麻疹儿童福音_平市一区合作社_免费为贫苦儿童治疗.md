　　Good News for Children with Measles
  　Cooperation Society in District One of Ping City
    Offers Free Treatment to Poor Children

    [This newspaper reports] Recently, due to climate imbalance, many children have contracted measles. To solve the difficulty of poor cooperative members and citizens not being able to afford medical treatment, the Cooperation Society in District One of Ping City has specially formulated medicines for the treatment of measles in children, which are donated to poor children in this and other districts suffering from the disease, free of charge for medication. The following points are also brought to the attention of citizens: 1. If a child has a fever that subsides, sweats slightly, has a clear and refreshed spirit, and regular bowel movements, with light-colored and moist measles spots, it is a normal state of measles and does not require medical treatment. However, the following maintenance methods should be noted: (1) Avoid eating meat, greasy, raw, cold, and stimulating foods. (2) Prevent overheating, catching a cold, and fright. (3) Avoid smoke from firewood, wool, and cigarettes, as well as the smell of cattle, sheep, candles, alcohol, coal, and paper cigarettes. (4) Do not eat food immediately after breastfeeding, and do not breastfeed immediately after eating. 2. If symptoms such as high fever without sweating, flushed face and irritability, red-purple measles spots, incoherent speech, severe cough, vomiting, etc., are found during the initial or complete outbreak of measles, prompt diagnosis and treatment should be sought to avoid danger.

    [Another report] To increase the health knowledge of cooperative members and citizens, the Cooperation Society in District One of the Inner City has decided to provide free answers to questions raised by everyone. Those who come to the society during the specified time (8:00 AM to 12:00 PM) will be answered in person. For those who inquire by mail, as long as they specify their name, address, and attach a stamped, self-addressed envelope, answers will be provided and mailed back.
