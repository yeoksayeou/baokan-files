【Taihang Electric】After the Yihua Yarn Factory, affiliated with Taihang Industrial Company, implemented a democratic management system with tiered responsibility, it unprecedentedly stimulated the production enthusiasm and creativity of the workers, enabling the factory to take a leap forward in its progress towards enterprise management. The factory was established in September of last year. Initially, due to the lack of yarn factory management knowledge among most cadres and the inability to fully utilize the enthusiasm and creativity of the workers, production could not be rapidly improved. To break through this difficulty, the factory leadership consciously made improvements, gradually identifying that the main reason hindering production was the lack of a democratic, tiered responsibility system in management. This was reflected in insufficient delegation by the leadership, with no clear definition of tasks and responsibilities for management cadres at all levels, resulting in a situation where superiors were busy while subordinates were idle.

Based on the above situation, the factory leadership resolved to improve management. First, a factory management committee was established, headed by the factory director and including representatives from the Party, the trade union, and the workers. Subsequently, meetings were held separately for electricians, power technicians, and team leaders, clearly defining their respective production tasks and responsibilities. This tiered responsibility system was further implemented among every worker, and it was clearly stated that the responsibility of the leadership was to conduct timely inspections and assist cadres at all levels in solving difficulties encountered in their work. The implementation of this mass line, democratic factory management system greatly enhanced the workers' sense of ownership. Workers from the Kuomintang-controlled areas (most of the factory's workers came from these areas) were particularly pleased. In the past, they had suffered all kinds of insults and oppression. Now, in their own country's factory, they not only had their lives improved and their dignity respected, but they could also participate in factory management, and their production enthusiasm consequently increased rapidly.

Following the establishment of the democratic management system, the workers automatically launched a new heroic production competition between shifts and between spinning machine operators, demonstrating an increased sense of responsibility towards the entire factory in practical actions. The leadership publicly announced the production increases and decreases of each shift, each machine, and each individual every day, and promptly praised and rewarded those who completed or exceeded production targets. Now, the workers are only afraid that the machines are running too slowly and not producing enough yarn, and they often urge the machine repairmen to test the speed of their machines.

Regarding the care of public property, workers can now consciously reduce waste. In the past, scattered yarn scraps left on the spinning machines were often left unmanaged. Now, the spinning machine operators automatically collect these scraps, weigh them, and use them again the next day.

In addition, workers have actively put forward many valuable suggestions for improving production and management, greatly assisting the leadership. Xue Shigui, an elderly worker of sixty years old, suggested: "Good and bad cotton should be separated; mixing them together affects the quality of the yarn." In the past, to reduce waste, the leadership wanted to weigh the waste cotton produced by each spinning machine operator for comparison, but because the workers hid it everywhere, it was always impossible to obtain accurate figures. Now, the workers have proposed that no one can hide it and that they should inspect each other. This conscious adherence to production discipline by the workers is much more effective than the leadership's inspection in the past. Now, every worker actively takes good care of their machine to prevent waste cotton from being produced. In the past, the leadership was afraid that workers would fall asleep, so they often used the method of inspecting the workers. Now, the workers have proposed: "Don't be afraid of him sleeping; as long as he produces more yarn and less waste cotton, he won't have time to sleep."

In the competition, the output of these old machines, which had been operating for over fifty years, was increased by 25% compared to the past. During the Japanese puppet regime, the average daily output was 28 bales (each bale weighing ten and a half pounds), with a maximum of 30 bales. Now (at the end of last year), it has increased to 35 bales. At the beginning of operation, the average daily output per spindle was 0.8 pounds, which increased to 0.92 pounds by December 31st last year.

To consolidate this production increase, the factory leadership recently proposed that the standard output for this year is 0.9 pounds of yarn per day, with bonuses for those who exceed the target. The workers unanimously replied, "We guarantee we can exceed it." On the first day of operation, January 5th, the output increased to 0.932 pounds.

### 益华纱厂实行民主管理  职工增强生产热忱　提高了产量又节约了原料

　　益华纱厂实行民主管理
    职工增强生产热忱
  　提高了产量又节约了原料
    【太行电】太行实业公司所属益华纱厂，实行民主管理的逐级负责制后，空前的发挥了工人的生产积极性与创造性，使该厂在走向企业化的进程上跃进了一步。该厂于去年九月创建，开始由于大部干部缺乏纱厂管理知识，广大职工的积极性与创造性得不到发挥，使生产不能迅速提高。厂领导上为突破这一难关，便有意识地进行改进，在工作中逐渐摸索到障碍生产的主要原因，是由于管理上缺乏民主化的逐级负责制。表现在领导上放手不够，对各级管理干部没有明确规定任务与职责，因而形成了上忙下闲的现象。
    依据上述情况，厂领导上决心改进管理。首先成立了以厂长为首并有党、工会及工人代表参加的工厂管理委员会。随即又分别召开了电工、动力工匠、组长会议，在会上明确的规定了各自的生产任务与职责、更将这种逐级负责制贯彻到每一个工人群众中，并明确提出：领导上的责任则是及时的进行检查，及时的帮助各级干部解决工作中的困难。实行了这种群众路线的民主管理工厂的制度后，大大地提高了工人主人翁的自觉。从蒋管区来的工人（该厂工人大部是从蒋管区来的），尤其高兴，他们过去受尽了百般侮辱与压迫，现在在自己国家的工厂里，不但生活上得到改善，人格上受到尊敬，又能参加管理工厂，因而他们的生产热忱遂即迅速增长。
    紧接着民主管理制的建立，工人就自动的开展了班与班、车工与车工（管理纺纱机的）间的新英雄主义生产竞赛，在实际行动中表现了工人对于整个工厂的负责精神大大增长。领导上每天公布各班、各车、各人的生产升降数量，并及时对完成与超过生产的给予表扬与奖励，现在职工光怕机器转的慢了不出纱，常常催促机工夫试验自己机子转动的速度。
    在爱护公物上，工人们现在都能自觉地去减少浪费。过去纱机上遗留的零散纱穗子，常常没人管理，现在车工们则自动的把散纱穗子收拾起来，并过秤作第二天再用。
    另外，工人们更积极的提出了许多改进生产与管理上的宝贵意见，大大地帮助了领导。六十岁的老工人薛士贵提出：“好坏花要分开，混在一起影响纱的质量。”过去领导上为减少浪费，要将各个车工出的废花过秤作比较，但因工人们到处隐藏，总是得不出精确数字；现在工人们提出谁也不能藏，并要互相检查。这种工人群众自觉的遵守生产纪律，比过去领导上检查作用大的多了。现在每个工人都是积极地把车看好，防止出废花。过去领导上怕工人睡觉常采检查工人的办法，现在工人们提出：“不要怕他睡觉，只要他多出纱，少出废花，他就顾不上睡了。”
    在竞赛中，使这已开动过五十年的破旧机器在产量上较过去提高了百分之二十五。过去日伪统治时，一昼夜平均出纱二十八包（每包十磅半），最高时出过三十包，现在（去年年底）则增加到三十五包。开工时每个纱锭每日平均产量是点八磅，到去年十二月三十一日则增加到点九二磅。
    厂领导上为巩固这一增产成绩，近又提出了今年的标准产量是每日产纱点九磅，超产者奖励。工人一致回答“保证能超过”。元月五日开工的第一天，产量即增至点九三二磅。
