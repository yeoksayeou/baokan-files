North China Trade Corporation Notice
	Suspension of Grain Store Sales on Commission
[Our Dispatch] The North China Trade Corporation recently issued a notice stating that the company had entrusted over fifty grain stores to widely sell grain on commission. It was discovered that some grain stores lowered quality, did not adhere to prices, and engaged in sabotage, preventing citizens from receiving actual benefits. Therefore, the commission sales are temporarily suspended. Once the reorganization is complete, the commission sales will continue, and the commission sales methods will be announced shortly.
