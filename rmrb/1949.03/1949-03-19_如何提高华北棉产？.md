How to Increase Cotton Production in North China?
    Tian Zhinong

    After eight years of the War of Resistance and more than two years of the War of Liberation, cotton production in North China (yield per mu and planting area) has decreased significantly. Last year, due to the poor cotton harvest, the average yield per mu decreased by 27% compared to pre-war levels. According to a survey of seventeen typical villages, the average yield per mu decreased by 32.3% compared to pre-war levels (1937). Last year, the cotton planting area in North China was 7.74 million mu. Compared with 1936 in the same region (when cotton was planted on approximately 18 million mu), this represents a decrease of 57%. The survey of these villages last year showed that the cotton planting area decreased by 47% compared to 1937. Due to the reduced planting area and decreased yield, the actual cotton production in North China last year (excluding eastern Hebei and the areas around Beijing and Tianjin) accounted for about one-third of the total production in 1936.

    North China is a major cotton-producing area in China, accounting for 33.7% of the country's cotton production (1935 statistics). Before the war, North China's cotton was an important export commodity and a source of supply for other provinces. Now, North China's cotton must not only meet the needs of the military and civilians in North China and guarantee the raw materials for more than 400,000 spindles, but also supply neighboring regions. However, last year's cotton production fell far short of demand. The shortage of cotton production must be overcome urgently. Therefore, expanding the cotton planting area and increasing the yield per mu have become one of the important production tasks this year.

    Here, let us first analyze the reasons for the decrease in cotton production:

    Cheap cotton and expensive grain mean that planting grain is more profitable than planting cotton, especially since cotton was planted extensively in 1936. The Japanese invaders occupied North China, manipulated cotton, and drove down cotton prices, causing cotton farmers to go bankrupt. The pain from this trauma still lingers today. There is a lack of labor and animal power, and planting cotton is labor-intensive; water wells are in disrepair, making irrigation difficult, and frequent spring droughts prevent planting as desired. Moreover, there is a shortage of fuel, requiring the planting of more tall-stalk crops to solve this problem. Therefore, it is not possible to plant more cotton fields, which is the reason for the reduced cotton planting area. As for the reasons for the decrease in yield per mu, the main ones are insufficient labor, inadequate field cultivation, and a lack of fertilizer. Generally, cotton fields are not fertilized. Cotton aphids and red spiders cause harm; secondly, the spacing between plants and rows is too small, and seeds are mixed and degraded, etc.

    To expand the cotton planting area and increase yield, it is necessary to address the above reasons and specifically solve the following problems:

    First, increase the income of cotton farmers. In addition to the agricultural tax regulations stipulating that increased income from planting special crops does not increase the burden, increasing the income of cotton farmers must be approached from two aspects: on the one hand, increase the yield per mu, and on the other hand, appropriately increase cotton prices (generally eight jin of rice per jin of ginned cotton), while solving the fuel shortage, so that the masses are willing to expand the cotton planting area.

    Second, organize the masses and mobilize women to participate in production to solve the labor shortage. "Weeding cotton requires no skill, diligently hoe the soil, and thoroughly remove the weeds." Women can handle weeding cotton. On the other hand, in the plains, promote the non-topping method for Sz cotton (but top the main stem) and widen the spacing between plants and rows. "As the saying goes: 'If the cotton stretches out, each plant will yield a jin.'" This can save labor.

    Third, increase fertilizer and plow and hoe more. This year, cotton fields are required to universally increase fertilizer (base fertilizer and top dressing), and provide loans to farmers for fertilizer when necessary. It is necessary to explain to the masses that more manure will result in more harvests, and even Chinese cotton needs manure, because the land has been impoverished by years of cotton planting, and manure is needed to produce more and prevent excessive vegetative growth. Cotton fields especially need to be plowed and hoeed more. "Hoe the cotton eight times, and the cotton bolls will form like garlic cloves."

    Fourth, prevent and control aphids and red spiders. This is the urgent need of cotton farmers. This year, we must vigorously promote the use of tobacco, lime water, and rotenone to control aphids, and flour paste water and lime-sulfur mixture to control red spiders. Organize the masses to fully use sprayers.

    Fifth, expand the area of American cotton and promote Sz cotton. Generally speaking, Sz cotton yields about 30% more than Chinese cotton. This year, we need to promote Sz cotton on more than 100,000 mu. In addition, promote seed replacement to overcome seed mixing and improve yield and quality.

    Sixth, to solve the problem of reduced food grain due to the expansion of cotton fields and the reduction of food crop area, encourage the planting of more sweet potatoes. Farmers are very clear that "one mu of sweet potatoes is equal to two mu of grain." If "Victory Sweet Potatoes" are planted, the yield can be 500 jin or more per mu compared to local sweet potatoes.

    In order to realize increased cotton production, we must widely publicize: the major cities in North China have been liberated, factories have started operation, and transportation has been restored, and the demand for cotton has greatly increased, and there will definitely be no cotton surplus. Agricultural production is gradually increasing, and grain production will also increase accordingly, and grain prices will be more stable. Moreover, cotton can be used to pay public grain. Therefore, we must change the practice of self-planting, self-eating, and self-use to regional division of labor according to overall needs, so that the land can be used to its full potential. At the same time, it must also be explained that planting cotton can solve the problems of lint (the small lint on cottonseed accounts for 3.7%, which can be taken out to make explosives and paper), oil, fertilizer, and feed (the value of cottonseed is no less than that of cotton, and cottonseed oil can replace peanut oil), so that factories can start operation and materials can be exchanged between urban and rural areas. At the same time, reform the old cotton production customs to make it serve the farmers, improve cotton planting techniques, and gradually achieve cotton production standardization.

    This year's task of increasing cotton production (area of 12 million mu - excluding eastern Hebei, yield of 25 jin of ginned cotton per mu) is arduous. We must mobilize extensively and specifically solve the difficulties of cotton farmers, and strive to achieve increased cotton production and ensure the operation of factories!

　　如何提高华北棉产？
    田治农
    经过八年抗战与两年多解放战争，华北棉产（每亩产量与种植面积）大减，去年因棉花歉收，每亩平均产量较战前降低百分之二十七，据十七个典型村调查：每亩平均产量较战前（一九三七年）降低百分之三十二点三。华北植棉面积去年为七七四万亩，以同一地区与一九三六年比较（是年植棉约一八○○万亩），减少了百分之五十七，去年这些村的调查，植棉面积较一九三七年减少百分之四十七。由于植棉面积缩小及产量降低，华北（未包括冀东及平津周围地区）去年实产棉花，约占一九三六年总产量的三分之一。
    华北为中国主要产棉区，占全国棉产百分之卅三点七（一九三五年统计），战前华北棉花为出口及供给其他省份的重要物资。现在华北棉花不独要供给华北军民所需，保证四十余万纱绽的原料，尚需供给邻区；而去年所产棉花远落于需要之后。棉产不足，急须克服，因此扩大植棉面积及提高每亩产量，即成为今年重要生产任务之一。
    这里我们先分析一下棉产降低的原因：
    花贱粮贵，种棉不如种粮，尤其是一九三六年种棉特多，日寇侵占华北，操纵棉花，压低棉价，使棉农破产。这个创伤，迄今仍有余痛。劳畜力缺少，种棉费工；水井失修，浇田困难，常遇春旱，不能如愿的种植，而且燃料缺少，必需多种高秆作物，才能解决这个困难。因此不能多种棉田，这就使棉花种植面积减少的原因。至于每亩产量降低的原因，主要的是劳力不足，田耕锄不周；肥料缺少，一般棉田多不施肥。棉蚜红蜘蛛为害；其次是株行距太小，种籽混杂退化等等。
    欲使植棉面积扩大，产量提高，必须针对上述原因，具体解决下面几个问题：
    第一、提高棉农收入。除农业税规定种植特种作物多收入不增加负担外，提高棉农收入须从两方面着手：一方面提高每亩产量，另方面适当的提高棉价（一般八斤米，一斤皮棉），同时解决燃料困难，使群众安于扩大植棉面积。
    第二、组织起来，发动妇女参加生产，解决劳力缺乏。“锄花无巧，勤锄泥土，净锄草。”锄花，妇女是可以胜任的。另方面平原地区的斯字棉提倡不打槎（但要打顶尖），加宽株行距。“农谚云：棉花扭开身，一颗摘一斤。”可以节省劳力。
    第三、增加肥料，多耙多锄。今年棉地要求普遍增加肥料（底肥及补肥），必要时贷给农民肥料。要向群众解释多上粪即可多收获，即便是中棉也需上粪，因种棉多年地瘠，上粪才能多产，不致长疯枝。棉地特别需要多耙多锄，花锄八遍，桃子结成蒜瓣。
    第四、防除蚜虫红蜘蛛，这是棉农的迫切要求。今年必须以大力推广烟草、石灰水、鱼藤粉防除蚜虫，面糊水、石灰硫磺合剂防除红蜘蛛。组织群众充分使用喷雾器。
    第五、扩大美棉面积，推广斯字棉。一般的说，斯字棉较中棉增产百分之三十左右，今年要推广斯字棉十万亩以上。此外，提倡换种，克服种籽混杂，提高产量与质量。
    第六、为了解决因棉田扩大食用作物面积缩小而致食粮减少的问题，提倡多种红薯，农民很清楚，“一亩红薯二亩谷”，如栽“胜利红薯”较本地红薯每亩尚可多收五百斤以上。
    为了实现棉花增产，我们要广泛宣传：华北各大城市已解放，工厂开工，交通恢复，棉花的需要量大增，决不致发生棉花过剩现象。农业生产逐渐提高，粮食亦随之增产，粮价将较平稳，而且棉花可顶公粮交纳。因之，要把自种、自吃、自用的作法，改为按全面需要，进行地区分工，使地尽其利。同时也要说明：植棉可解决布棉（棉籽上的小花衣占百分之三点七，取出可制炸药造纸等），油料、肥料、饲料问题（棉籽的价值不低于棉花，棉油可代替花生油，），使工厂开工，城乡间物资得以交流。同时改造旧的棉产改关，使其为农民服务，改进植棉的技术，逐渐做到棉产规格化。
    今年提高棉产（面积一千二百万亩——未包括冀东，每亩产皮棉二十五斤），任务艰巨，我们要深入动员，具体解决棉农困难，为实现提高棉产，保证工厂开工而努力！
