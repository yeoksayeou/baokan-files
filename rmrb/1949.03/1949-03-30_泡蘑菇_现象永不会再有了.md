　　The Phenomenon of "Soaking Mushrooms" Will Never Happen Again

　　With the liberation of Beiping, our Eighth District Highway Bureau's Engineering Transportation Team's repair shop has also begun to breathe the air of true democracy and freedom. After less than two months of study, the past "mushroom soaking" ideology has disappeared. In the past, the factory highly exploited the workers, and the workers could only vent their anger by "soaking." At that time, it took three people three days to disassemble and assemble a complete set of four or five Jida Ji rear spring assemblies, but in reality, six hours was enough; now, things are very different. Although work hasn't officially started yet, the current situation of cleaning up the factory site and dismantling scrapped vehicles shows that the situation is completely different. Now, twenty-eight people, divided into four shifts, are dismantling twenty-seven scrapped vehicles, disassembling and preserving them step by step by category from the engine, chassis, and body; the task will be completed in about a week.

　　In the past, there was a lack of care and responsibility for equipment and accessories, and there were frequent cases of loss, but what about now? The disassembled parts are sorted, organized, and stored by category for future use.

　　I believe that these are by no means temporary bursts of excitement, but rather that the workers are gradually recognizing that they have become the masters of the country. As long as production is developed, both themselves and their country will benefit. This new understanding will cause this enthusiasm to increase with each passing day. The phenomenon of "soaking mushrooms" will never happen again.

　　“泡蘑菇”现象永不会再有了
    北平解放了，我们八区公路局工程运输队修车厂也开始呼吸到了真正民主自由的气息。经过不到两个月的学习，过去的“泡蘑菇”主义已经没有了。在过去，工厂高度剥削工人，工人们惟有“泡”才能发泄愤怒。那时候拆装一整套的四五道济后弓子，三个人去作要三天作完，其实有六个小时足够；现在则大不相同，虽然还没开工，但以现在清理厂地，拆卸报废车辆情形，就可以看到情形完全不同了。现在二十八个人，分四班，拆卸二十七辆废车，都是由引擎、底盘、车身，一步步的分类拆卸、保存；在一个星期上下就完成任务。
    在过去，对于器材及配件不爱惜，不负责，时有丢失的情形，但现在呢？拆下来的机件，都分门别类，有条有理的整理、存放，以备将来应用。
    这些，我认为决不是一时的兴奋现象，而是工人们逐渐认清了自己已成为国家的主人。只要发展了生产，自己和自己的国家都有好处。这种新的认识，将使这种热情随日月而增高。“泡蘑菇”的现象也永远不会再有了。
