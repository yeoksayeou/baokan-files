　　Questions and Answers

　　1. What are the differences between "Honorarium," "Solatium," and "Production Subsidy"? Editor:
    Please tell me: (1) What are the differences between honorarium, solatium, and production subsidy? What are their meanings, and how many catties of millet are allocated for each?
    (2) If a third-class honorably discharged soldier is employed by a public institution, store, or primary school as a teacher, will the solatium still be issued? How much millet is the solatium amount? How many times is it issued?
    (3) According to the new regulations, how much preferential compensation should a third-class honorably discharged soldier receive upon retirement?
    Comrade Dong Jin, Luyi County:
    The answers to your questions are as follows:
    (1) After being wounded, an honorably discharged soldier's body is damaged, and his physical strength is weak. A certain amount of money is given to allow the honorably discharged soldier to receive adequate nutrition and gradually recover his health. This amount is called an honorarium. Secondly, after an honorably discharged soldier becomes disabled, loses part or most, or even all of his production capacity, and is not suitable for work in the military, he needs to retire home. In order to guarantee a certain standard of living for the honorably discharged soldier, a solatium is issued after he retires home to solve or subsidize living problems. This amount is called a solatium. Honorably discharged soldiers or elderly and infirm veterans are given a certain amount of money based on their length of service to engage in production and establish a household after returning home. This amount is called a production subsidy. These are the differences in the names of the three amounts. How much is the amount? It is determined by the severity of the disability and the degree of loss of labor, and after assessing the grade, it is received from the county government. The number of catties of millet issued for each item can be found in the "North China Region Honorable Soldier Preferential Treatment and Solatium Regulations" and the "North China Region Elderly and Infirm Veteran Measures" at the nearest county government.
    (2) The reason why a third-class honorably discharged soldier who is employed by a public institution, store, or primary school as a teacher still receives the solatium and honorarium is to encourage honorably discharged soldiers to participate in work and continue to serve the people. Those who voluntarily do not receive or receive less can be commended. For the amounts and methods of issuance, please refer to the "North China Region Honorable Soldier Preferential Treatment and Solatium Regulations" on the fourth page of the People's Daily of　Month　Day.
    (3) When a third-class honorably discharged soldier returns home, in addition to the production subsidy based on length of service, the third-class Grade A solatium is 500 catties of millet (issued in one lump sum), the honorarium is 400 catties of millet (issued in two years, 200 catties per year), and the third-class Grade B solatium is 300 catties of millet (issued in one lump sum). The honorarium is 300 catties of millet (issued in two years, 150 catties per year).

　　询问与答复
    一、“荣誉金”“抚衅金”“生产补助金”有何不同？编者：
    请问：（一）荣誉金，抚衅金，生产补助金，怎样区别？含有什么意义，各项小米数有多少？
    （二）三等荣誉军人充任公立机关，商店雇员，或小学教员，抚衅金照发，此项抚衅金是多少小米？分几次发？
    （三）三等荣誉军人退伍，新规定条例，应领优抚费多少？
    鹿县东金东金同志：
    所提问题，答复如下：
    （一）荣军在负伤后，身体受到摧残，体力弱，发给其一定金额，以便使荣军同志能得到适当的营养，而逐渐恢复健康，此项金额就叫做荣誉金。其次，荣军残废后，失去了一部，或大部份，甚至全部生产能力，不宜于部队工作，而需退休回家时，为保证荣军的一定生活水平，故在退伍回家后，再发给抚衅费，解决或补助生活问题，此项金额，叫做抚衅费。荣军或年老病弱军人退伍，按军龄长短发给其一定的金额，作为回家后，从事生产建立家务之用，此项金额，叫做生产补助金。这就是三种金额名义的区别，其数量多少？视其残废轻重，丧失劳力之大小，评定等级后，向县府领取，各项小米的发给数目，可在就近县府查看：“华北区荣誉军人优待抚衅条例”及“华北区年老病弱退伍军人办法”即可。
    （二）三等荣军在退伍后，充任公立机关商店雇员，或小学教员者，其抚衅费，荣誉金，仍照发的原因，是为了鼓励荣军参加工作，继续为人民服务，其自愿不领，或少领，可予以表扬。其数字多少与发给办法，请参阅　月　日人民日报第四版，“华北区荣誉军人优待抚衅条例。”
    （三）三等荣军人退伍回家时，除按军龄长短发给生产补助金外，三等甲级抚衅费，小米五百市斤（一次发给），荣誉金小米四百市斤（分二年分给，每年发二百市斤），三等乙级抚衅费小米三百市斤（一次发给）。荣誉金小米三百市斤（分二年发给，每年一百五十市斤）。
