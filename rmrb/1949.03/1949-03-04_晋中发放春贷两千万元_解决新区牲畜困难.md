Jinzhong Issues 20 Million Yuan in Spring Loans
　　Solving Livestock Difficulties in New Districts
    [Jinzhong Electric] With the spring plowing season approaching, the Jinzhong Branch of the People's Bank of China, in order not to miss the farming season and to solve the problem of draft animal shortages for the people of Jinzhong, has issued 20 million yuan (Renminbi) in draft animal loans. To this end, with the assistance of the Jinzhong Administrative Office, the bank convened a meeting of commissioners from the first, second, and third administrative districts and directors of bank offices to discuss various issues related to the rapid disbursement of livestock loans. In addition to thoroughly discussing the allocation of livestock loan amounts, it was decided to set the livestock loan interest rate lower than commercial loans (10% to 15%) with a term of one to two months, in order to encourage the masses to purchase more livestock and increase production. Currently, each special district and branch bank has been writing letters or dispatching cadres to specifically organize this work so that the masses can trade at the upcoming mule and horse fairs in various locations. At present, many agencies and stores in the Second Special District and Yuci, in addition to providing some of their own funds, are preparing to borrow money to purchase livestock in large quantities from Shaanxi. According to branch banks in various locations, the masses are now flocking to Shaanxi, Suiyuan, and along the Yellow River to buy livestock in preparation for spring plowing.
