　　A Few Words

            The Special Difficulties of Female Workers Must Be Resolved
    Female workers constitute a significant portion of the workforce in China's light industry, forming a major force in industrial production. In areas like Shijiazhuang, female workers, under the leadership of their class vanguard, are working diligently and setting new labor examples, demonstrating their leadership role both politically and socially. However, it must also be acknowledged that they face many specific personal challenges, such as ideological education, marriage, healthcare, and childbirth, which need to be addressed appropriately. In the past, many places, due to insufficient understanding of the leading role of the working class in the revolution, have neglected the work related to female workers, failed to emphasize their education, inadequately addressed their special difficulties, failed to provide female worker welfare, overlooked the role female workers should play in trade unions, and neglected to actively organize them to participate in trade unions. This is undoubtedly a significant error. The specific issues raised by Shijiazhuang demonstrate that their work with female workers is deepening and strengthening. It is hoped that the ongoing National Women's Congress will discuss how to better resolve these issues and establish some necessary measures.
    　　　　The Supervisory Yuan’s Wise Measures of Being Responsible to the People
    The North China People's Supervisory Yuan thoroughly investigated the Jianping County incident of wasting people's resources, educating cadres through action on correct mass perspectives and opposing bureaucracy. This spirit should be greatly promoted. The "Criticism and Suggestions" column of this newspaper will strive to connect the people and the government, ensuring that grassroots opinions are promptly conveyed upwards. Readers across the country are encouraged to provide constructive suggestions from various perspectives to protect their liberated areas and the people, and to expose all bureaucratic and harmful behaviors. Currently, some departments and individuals still adopt a dismissive attitude towards criticisms in the newspaper. They neither clarify right and wrong nor conduct thorough self-examination in the face of criticism, which is highly inappropriate and represents a lack of responsibility to the people. This must be resolutely corrected. The wise measures of the North China People's Supervisory Yuan in thoroughly investigating the Jianping incident of wasting people's resources will have a significant driving effect.
    　　　　How Much of the Production Plan Has Been Implemented?
    Some people believe that once a production plan is formulated, production will proceed smoothly. This is the wishful thinking of those who are ridiculed by Comrade Stalin as "sincere empty talkers." The inspections in Nangong County and other areas in southern Hebei province have proven that we will encounter many difficulties in implementing production plans. Some are due to the subjectivity in formulating the plan, such as setting the plan too high, which inevitably leads to setbacks, requiring revision. Others are due to a failure to understand the people's concerns. When you propose expanding cotton fields, the people worry that if everyone grows cotton, "cheap cotton will harm farmers," and they will falsely report the acreage of cotton planted. In this way, the production plan is disconnected from the masses and will never become a movement. To solve this problem, the Party and the government must earnestly go among the masses to solicit opinions, investigate various problems in production, and see what is hindering the implementation of the production plan. Then, address them specifically. Otherwise, even if a very ideal plan is formulated, but it is not connected with the masses, it will remain just a piece of paper.

　　三言两语
            女工特殊困难必须解决
    女工，在中国轻工业工人中占有极大的数量，是工业生产的一支大军，象石家庄这样地区的女工在自己阶级先锋队的领导下努力生产，创造了新的劳动榜样，显示出无论在政治上在社会上都处在了领导的地位；另一方面也必须承认，她们确实有着许多特殊的切身问题，象思想教育、婚姻、保健、生育等，需要合理地解决。过去，许多地方由于对工人阶级在革命中的领导作用认识不足，因此也便忽视了女工工作，不注重对女工的教育，没有很好解决女工的特殊困难，办理女工福利事业，忽视了女工在职工会中应起的作用，没有认真地组织女工参加职工会，这无疑是十分错误的。石家庄提出这些具体问题证明他们的女工工作是在深入在加强，如何更好地求得解决，希望在平正在举行的全国妇女代表大会能有所讨论，并规定一些必要的办法。
    　　　　监察院对人民负责的英明措施
    华北人民监察院彻底查究建屏县浪费民力事件，从行动上教育干部以正确的群众观点，反对官僚主义，这种精神应大大提倡。本报批评与建议栏将努力于沟通人民与政府联系，使下情得及时上达。要求各地读者为爱护自己的解放区和人民，从多方面来提出各种建设性意见，揭发一切官僚主义与危害人民的行为。目前仍有个别部门和人员，对报上所加予的批评采取不睬理态度，他们在批评面前，既不明辩是非，又不认真检讨，这是十分不妥的，是一种对人民不负责的表现，必须坚决纠正。华北人民监察院澈查建屏浪费民力的英明措施，将会起着重大的推动作用。
    　　　　生产计划贯彻几许？
    有人认为订了生产计划，大概往后生产便可以一帆风顺地实现了，这是那种为斯大林同志所嘲笑的“诚恳的说空话的人”底痴想。冀南南宫等县的检查证明：在贯彻生产计划中我们会碰到许多困难，其中有的是由于订计划的主观主义，譬如计划订得太高，结果只好碰钉子，这就须要修正。也有的是没有摸群众的心思，你说扩大棉田，群众顾虑大家种棉多了，“棉贱伤农”，便来假报种棉亩数。这样生产计划与群众脱节，永远不会形成运动。为了解决这一问题，须要党和政府认真到群众中去征求意见，调查生产中各种问题，看看有什么东西障碍着生产计划的实现？然后具体地加以解决，否则，纵使订了十分理想的计划，但是同群众联系不起来，只好仍是一纸空文。
