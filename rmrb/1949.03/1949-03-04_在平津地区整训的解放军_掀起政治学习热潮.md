Xinhua News Agency, Beiping, 2nd: Since the People's Liberation Army in the Pingjin area began its political consolidation and training, it has quickly overcome the erroneous thinking of some comrades who were not seeking progress and has launched a craze for political study. At the beginning of the mobilization, some comrades thought: "The revolution is about to succeed, we should enjoy ourselves, what else is there to study?" Or they said, "Let's go when we're told, fight when we're told, why bother with consolidation and training? I think we should fight quickly! Don't let the enemy catch their breath." Some said, "We are roughnecks, we can fight and train, but studying politics gives us a headache." Among the administrative staff, some excused themselves by saying that they were busy with work, old, and slow-witted, and couldn't learn; among the newly liberated soldiers, some thought: "A soldier only needs to fight, what good is studying politics?" After five days of discussions, deliberations, and repeated explanations, and after conducting profound reflections on their respective work in connection with the current situation of victory, everyone gradually felt that their political level was still lagging behind the actual requirements. Some comrades were worried about whether they would be able to master the policies in the new areas in the future. Some odd-job men publicly admitted that it was wrong in the past to make excuses of "being busy with work and slow-witted" and unwilling to study. A new soldier who had just been liberated in the Tanggu battle also said: "Being a soldier in the Kuomintang was being a muddle-headed soldier. Now that I have joined the revolutionary army, if I want to be a good soldier of the people, I must study hard, open my mind, and understand revolutionary principles." A cook in a certain unit listed "study well" together with "cook well" and "stir-fry well" in his work plan. Now all units of the army have collective study plans, and everyone has personal study plans, stipulating the content, system, and discipline of the study. Many soldiers saved their allowances, and those who smoked would rather not buy cigarettes and bought stationery for study. A new soldier in a certain unit took out his gold ring and asked his superiors to exchange it for paper and pens. During study time, there was not a single idle soldier to be seen on the streets and alleys of the villages where they were stationed, the dormitories of each squad and platoon were quiet, and there was not a single person yawning in the classroom. The teachers who gave lectures were also preparing their lectures with a hundred times more tension.

Xinhua News Agency, Beiping, 28th: A certain regiment of the People's Liberation Army in the suburbs of Beiping recently welcomed new comrades who had been liberated from the Kuomintang army and joined the People's Liberation Army. As soon as the news of the arrival of the new comrades spread, the companies of the entire regiment became busy. Some comrades were responsible for writing welcome slogans and composing clappers, some were borrowing gongs and drums everywhere, and some were planning to donate money to buy cigarettes and meat. When the new comrades arrived, the old comrades greeted them with torches, gongs, drums, and songs. The soldier Zhang Wencai offered cigarettes to the new comrades and said with clappers: "Welcome to my class, everyone please have a cigarette, unite in love to seek liberation, eliminate the reactionaries and avenge grievances." After the new comrades were incorporated into the company, the old comrades took meticulous care of their lives. The veteran soldier Fan Jihua boiled water to scald lice for the new comrades during bedtime. Touched by the enthusiasm of the old comrades, some of the new comrades said: "Being a soldier in the People's Liberation Army is really glorious." Some said, "Now I have really arrived at my own home." Many others voluntarily confessed their past anti-people mistakes, expressed their willingness to carry the revolution through to the end, and requested to be tested in future combat missions.

　　在平津地区整训的解放军
  　掀起政治学习热潮
    【新华社北平二日电】平津地区解放军开始政治整训后，迅速克服了若干同志不求进步的错误思想，掀起了政治学习的热潮。在开始动员时，某些同志认为：“革命快胜利了，我们该享福了，还学习什么？”或者说：“说走就走，要打就打，何必整训，我看还是快打吧！别让敌人喘过气来。”有的则说：“我们是大老粗，打仗练兵都行，学政治有点头痛。”在事务人员中，有的借口工作忙，年纪大，脑筋笨，学不进去；新解放过来的战士中，有的则认为：“当兵的能打仗就行，学政治能顶啥用？”经过五天的座谈、酝酿与反复解释，并就目前胜利形势联系各自的工作进行深刻的反省后，大家就渐渐感到自己的政治水平还落后于实际要求，有的同志担心自己将来到新区能否掌握政策；有些勤杂人员当众承认了过去借口“工作忙、脑筋笨”而不愿学习是不对的；一个在塘沽战斗中刚解放过来的新战士也表示：“在国民党那边是当糊涂兵，现在参加了革命军队，要作个人民的好战士，就非好好学习、打开脑筋、懂得革命道理不行了。”某部一个炊事员把“学习好”与“作饭好”、“炒菜好”一起列入工作计划之内。现全军各单位都有集体学习计划，大家又都有个人学习计划，规定了学习的内容、制度和纪律。许多战士把津贴费节省下来，抽烟的宁可不买烟，买了学习用的文具。某部一个新解放的战士拿出自己的金戒指，请上级给他换成纸笔。在学习时间内，驻地村庄里的街巷上已看不到一个闲散的军人，各班排的宿舍都静悄悄的，课堂里没有一个打呵睡的，担任讲课的教员也都百倍紧张地准备讲课。
    【新华社北平二十八日电】平郊解放军某团，最近在驻地欢迎从国民党军解放出来参加解放军的新同志。当新同志要来的消息刚传出，全团各连队都忙碌起来，有的同志负责写欢迎标语和编快板，有的到处借锣借鼓，有的就筹划捐钱买烟买肉。新同志来到时，老同志们就打着火把，敲着锣鼓，唱着歌去迎接。战士张文才一边请新同志抽烟，一边说着快板：“欢迎你们来我班，一人请吸一支烟，亲爱团结求解放，消灭反动派报仇冤。”新同志编入连队后，老同志又细心地关照他们的生活。老战士范辑花在晚上睡觉的时间给新同志烧水烫虱子。在老同志们的热情感动之下，有的新同志说：“当个解放军，可真光荣啊。”有的说：“这下可真到了自己家门口了。”还有许多则自动坦白过去反人民的错误，愿意从此革命到底，要求在以后战斗任务中给以考验。
