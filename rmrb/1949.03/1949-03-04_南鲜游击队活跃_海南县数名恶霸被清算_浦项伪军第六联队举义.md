    [Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 2nd] Pyongyang dispatch: Since late January, South Korean people's armed forces have been active not only in the southwestern Jeolla South and Jeolla North provinces, but also in the southeastern Gyeongsang North and Gyeongsang South provinces, and the central Chungcheong North Province. In Jeolla South Province, guerrilla activities have taken place in more than ten counties, ranging from Gwangyang in the east, Boseong, Goheung and Hainan in the south, Hampyeong and Eungwang in the west, to Jangseong and Gokseong in the north. In early February, guerrillas in Suncheon defeated a puppet police detachment, and guerrillas in Boseong and Gwangyang occupied mountainous areas. At the end of January, under the leadership of the guerrillas, several local tyrants in Hainan County were liquidated. In Gyeongsang North Province, the Sixth Regiment of pro-Japanese troops in Pohang, located on the southeastern coast, staged an uprising on January 30. After attacking the Pohang Police Station, they cooperated with the guerrillas to occupy the mountainous area between Yeongcheon and Gyeongju, southwest of Pohang. Another unit occupied the police station in Cheongdo County in the south. Guerrilla warfare is now being conducted in vast areas of Gyeongsang North and Gyeongsang South provinces.
