　　Agricultural Tax Based on Potential Yields Aims to Encourage Production
    Question:
    I am from Beisong Village, Sixteenth District, Ding County, Ninth Sub-district of Ji'zhong. I am currently working in the political department of a certain unit. I have a question to ask for clarification. My family has four people and cultivates less than eleven mu of land. Last year's total output was nine shi, while the village set the potential yield at fourteen shi. The reason my yield is low is due to a lack of labor and means of production (such as livestock). The two mu of irrigated land in the east of the village (each mu with a potential yield of two shi and four dou) was only planted for one season. If the tax is levied based on the potential yield, the family's life will be very difficult. I wrote to the village government of the district, requesting that the tax be levied based on the actual yield. I don't know if this is against our policy?

    Answer:
    In order to reward intensive farming and increase production, the government levies agricultural burdens based on potential yields rather than actual yields. This allows farmers to increase production without increasing the burden. Therefore, your request to the district government to levy the tax based on actual yield is inappropriate. If your family feels that life is difficult due to a lack of labor and means of production, solutions should be sought through various aspects such as mutual aid farming, labor exchange, and organizing production. The village government of Beisong Village in Ding County should focus on resolving the difficulties of military families.

　　按应产量征收农业税是为了鼓励生产
    问：
    我是冀中九分区定县十六区北宋村人，现在某部政治部工作，我有一个问题请解答。我家共四口人，种地不到十一亩，去年的总产量是九石，村中定的应产量是十四石，我之所以产量低，是因为缺劳动力，又缺生产手段，（如牲口等）村东二亩水浇地（每亩定应产量二石四斗）只种了一季。这样如按应产量征收，家中生活即很困难；我曾向该区村政府去信，要求按实产量征收，不知这样是否与咱们的政策相违背？
    读者——魏敏
    答：
    为了奖励精耕细作增加产量，政府征收农业负担，按应产量而不按实产量，这样可使农民增加产量而不增加负担，因之你向区政府提出要求按实产量征收，是不合适的。你家因无劳力，缺乏生产手段，感到生活困难，应从代耕、互助变工、组织生产等各方面来解决。定县北宋村村政府应注重解决军属困难。
