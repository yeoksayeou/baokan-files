[Jidong Electric] Farmers in Pinggu, Yutian and other places are actively allocating labor to deliver manure in preparation for spring sowing. After the Spring Festival, the third district of Pinggu began to mobilize villages to deliver manure. On the second day of the (lunar) new year, Gengjing Village used more than 40 animals to deliver manure. By the 18th day of the first month, the village had delivered more than 6,000 loads of manure accumulated last autumn and winter (each load about 200 pounds). By the end of the first month, it will be completely delivered, and the land will be tidied up. Villages such as Hanzhuang and Huzhuang have mostly delivered the autumn manure and have begun to haul soil to line pig pens for further fertilizer accumulation. In order to save manpower during the manure delivery, most villages freely combine into labor allocation groups according to old habits. For example, in Gengjing Village, more than 40 households are combined into mutual aid labor allocation groups of two or three families, with one person driving two or three animals. The whole village can save more than 20 laborers every day. Moreover, most villages deliver manure to military families first. Before the fifth day of the first month, Kaoshanji delivered manure to the fields for three military families without labor. Farmers in Zuwu Village helped military families repair houses and replace new kangs, using waste soil as manure to solve the difficulty of fertilizer shortage. With the help of a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army, Zhanggezhuang in the second district of the county built more than 50 pig pens in five days, and helped deliver the manure to the fields. The manure for early crops on all 1,226 mu of land in the village has been delivered. The fertilizer shortage for 400 mu of land will be solved by spring fertilizer accumulation. The Communist Party branch of the village called on each household to guarantee 10 to 15 loads of manure per mu. Communist Party members played an exemplary role in production, leading farmers to actively produce and strive not to waste land and produce more grain. In Yutian and Baodi counties, more than 690 villages have delivered manure to the fields for spring wheat planting. During last winter, in Maipo Village, Yutian Chengguan District, Ji Lianyou and three other families jointly opened a flour mill to accumulate more fertilizer. In three months, they earned 330 bean cakes and accumulated more than 100 carts of fertilizer. This year, the three families have voluntarily organized to deliver manure to their 20 mu of wheat land ahead of schedule.

　　平谷玉田等地农民
    拨工送粪准备播种　拉土垫圈再积新肥
    【冀东电】平谷、玉田等地农民正积极拨工送粪，准备春耕播种。平谷三区于春节过后各村即紧张动员起来开始送粪。耿井村于（旧）正月初二日，就用四十多个牲畜送粪，到正月十八日全村已把去年秋冬积粪送出六千余驮（每驮约二百斤），到正月底则可全部送完，转入收拾地。韩庄、胡庄等村已将秋粪大部送完，开始驮土垫猪圈再积新肥。各村在送粪中为节省人力，大部按旧有习惯，自由结合拨工组。如耿井村有四十余户，都是两三家结成一个互助拨工组，由一人赶两三个牲畜。全村每天能省人工二十余个。并且大部村庄又都是先给军属送粪，靠山集在正月初五以前，就把三户无劳力军属的粪送到地里。祖务村农民帮助军属修理房子、换新炕，以废土当粪解决部分肥料缺乏的困难。该县二区张各庄在解放军某部帮助下五天起猪圈五十多个，又帮助送到地里。全村一千二百二十六亩地，其中早庄稼的粪已经送完，尚缺四百亩地的肥料，则由春季积肥解决。该村中共支部号召各户每亩保证上粪十驮至十五驮。共产党员在生产中起模范作用，领导农民积极生产，争取不荒土地多打粮食。玉田、宝坻两县已有六百九十多村把种春麦的粪送到地里。玉田城关区麦坡村吉连佑三家为多积肥去冬合伙开粉坊，三个月赚豆饼三百三十块，积肥一百多车。今年三家又自动组织起来，将二十亩麦地的粪提前送完。
