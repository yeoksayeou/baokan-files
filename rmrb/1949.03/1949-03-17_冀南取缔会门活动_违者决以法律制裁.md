Jinnan Bans Sect Activities
　Violators Will Be Punished by Law
　　[Jinnan Electric News] As spring is a time when diseases easily spread, the Jinnan Third and Fifth Administrative Offices discovered that bad elements were using the backward mentality of some people to organize and develop sects and secret societies, disrupting mass production. The local government has strictly banned them. In Zaoqiang County, Fifth Administrative Region, four altar masters of “Yiguan Dao” openly set up altars to recruit followers, enlisting more than 200 followers daily. In Jingxian County, the “Sage and Virtuous Dao” used deceptive methods to recruit 90 followers. Other sects and secret societies such as the “Buddhist Church,” “Xihua Hall,” “Xiantian Dao,” and “One Incense Stick” are also very active, with many people wasting time and hindering production under their deception every day. In Ru Zuo Village, Yongnian Second District, Third Administrative Region, the head of the “Six Harmonies Boxing,” colluded with village cadres who had been expelled or removed from their positions during the Party rectification in the village, seized control of the militia, and privately launched struggles, tying up and beating Jia Xiutian, the former director of the village farmers' association. The county government immediately arrested the murderers and brought them to justice. In Xiyangjian, Second District, and Da Xiaowang Village, Fourth District, Congshang Township, Linzhang, Third Administrative Region, and also in Zaolin and Wangliuzhuang Villages in Weixian County, incidents of “obtaining divine medicine” occurred. Oil Mill and Bei Luoguan in Guangping County, and Dongguan Yaoshang and Xiaheting Villages in Chengan County also had occurrences of obtaining medicine. After the above serious phenomena occurred, the local government immediately took measures to stop their activities. After the leaders of sects and secret societies in the First District of Linzhang County received current affairs education from the government, they revealed the truth. Some joined because they were ideologically backward and were deceived into participating in order to cure their family members' illnesses; others participated in order to cheat for some good food. Wu Shaoping from Southeast Chengjiao said: "I have seen a few prescriptions in medical books. When someone asks me to see a doctor, I pretend to be a ghost and talk nonsense, and give them some medicine to eat. When I want to eat meat, I ask them to make offerings." Sun Sigui from Beiguan said: "In 'Monkey Dao,' I asked the masses to use yellow paper to make offerings, sold the yellow paper to buy wine and meat." Based on these facts of repentance, combined with the past crimes of the Kuomintang using Dao and secret societies to spread rumors and disrupt production, the peasants were enlightened to recognize the dangers of Dao and secret societies. The government then announced the dissolution of their organizations and the cessation of their activities, and violators will be punished by law. Before returning home, they were ordered to confess their past deceptive acts at mass meetings in their villages, and to promptly report the activities of others to the government. They all expressed their attitude and guaranteed to do so. In addition, many areas are conducting education to the masses in conjunction with the central work, exposing rumors, and preparing to carry out a universal and in-depth anti-superstition propaganda through the recent epidemic prevention work.

　　冀南取缔会门活动
  　违者决以法律制裁
    【冀南电】现值春季疾病容易流行之际，冀南三、五专署发现坏分子利用部份群众的落后心理，组织发展会、道门，破坏群众生产的；已被当地政府严加取缔，五专区枣强县“一贯道”四个坛主公开设坛吸收道徒，日收道徒在二百人以上；景县“圣贤道”用欺骗办法已吸收道徒九十人；其他“佛教会”、“西华堂”、“先天道”、“一柱香”等会、道门活动亦烈，每日有很多群众在他们愚弄下贻误生产。三专区永年二区茹佐村“六合拳”头子，拉拢该村在整党中被开除撤职的村干部，掌握民兵，私自发动斗争，捆打该村前农会主任贾修田，该县政府已立即将凶手逮捕法办。三专区临漳北关葱上二区西扬蒹、四区大小王庄发生“取神药”事件，并蔓延至魏县之枣林、王刘庄等村。广平县之油坊、北罗管，成安县东关窑上、下河町等村庄均发现取药事件。以上严重现象发生后，当地政府立即采取措施停止其活动。临漳县一区会、道门头子在政府向其进行时事教育后，均吐露真情。有的是因为思想落后，为了给自家人治病而被骗参加；有的是为着要骗点好的吃而参加。东南城角吴绍平说：“我在医书上看过几个药方子，有人找我看病，就装神弄鬼，胡说一顿，给弄点药吃。我想吃肉，就叫他上供”。北关孙思桂说：“我在‘猴道’叫群众用黄表上供，把黄表卖了买酒喝，买肉吃”。根据这些反省的事实，结合过去国民党利用道、会门造谣破坏生产的罪恶行为，启发农民认识到在道、会门的危险性。政府随即宣布解散其组织，停止其活动，违者决以法律制裁。临回家前，令其回村后在群众会上坦白过去骗人的事实，并须将别人的活动及时向政府反映。他们均表明态度，保证做到。此外，不少地区结合中心工作，向群众进行教育，揭穿谣言，并准备通过最近防疫工作，进行普遍深入的反迷信宣传。
