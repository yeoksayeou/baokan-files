　　Mentougou Coal Mine, Li Chunjiang's Invention
    Iron Hook Instead of Iron Chain
    Easy to Hang, Unload, and Saves Time
    [Our Dispatch] The Mentougou Xishan Coal Mine has been experimenting with replacing the iron chains used to connect the front and rear coal cars (罐, i.e., coal cars) with iron hooks. After several studies and modifications, the experiment has been successful. Hanging and unloading are very convenient, saving time and maximizing the effectiveness of electric picks. This is a significant improvement in underground transportation. The initial suggestion for this improvement came from Li Chunjiang, a supervisor at the mine. He had seen similar iron hooks at the Jingxing Mine. After arriving at the Xishan Mine in 1947, he felt that the iron chains here could be replaced with iron hooks, but he kept it to himself because he felt insecure about his job. Now that liberation has arrived, he felt he could no longer keep it to himself. On February 12th, he proposed the idea of using iron hooks to Chief Supervisor Qin Lianfang, who encouraged him to make one for experimentation. Because the coal cars at the Jingxing Mine are different from those at the Xishan Mine, the iron hooks also need to be different. The size of the iron hook, the proportion of each part, and making the small iron rings on the hook convenient and durable, all went through several studies, experiments, and modifications. During this period, he received great help from some workers (such as machine room foreman Wang Xiukui, etc.), and finally the experiment was successful. Underground coal transportation will be more convenient and faster. Because making iron hooks only requires bending a measured iron rod. The effort to make one iron chain can make ten iron rods. In the future, not only will the Xishan Mine switch to using iron rods, but it is also suggested that all mines in Mentougou study and adopt them.

### 门头沟煤矿厉春蛟发明  用铁钩代替铁链条　挂卸方便节省时间

　　门头沟煤矿厉春蛟发明
    用铁钩代替铁链条
    挂卸方便节省时间
    【本报讯】门头沟西山煤矿，试验以铁钩代替从前前罐挂后罐（罐，即煤车）所用之铁链条。几经研究改造，现已试验成功，挂卸很方便，节省时间，可以尽量发挥电镐车的效能。在井下运输上，大大的改进了一步。这次改进的最初的建议者，是该矿监工厉春蛟。他曾在井陉矿见过相类似的铁钩，一九四七年到西山矿后，感到可以把这里的铁链条改成铁钩，但因当时工作无保障，不安心，也就闷在心里。现在解放了，他觉得再也闷不住了，在二月十二号，就向总监工秦连芳提出这个改用铁钩的建议，得到总监工的鼓励，叫他试做一个来实验。因为井陉矿的煤罐与西山矿的形式不同，所以铁钩的形式也不一样。铁钩的大小，各部份的比例、以及要使钩上的小铁环用时方便、耐用，都经过几次研究、实验、修改。在这个期间，得到一些工人（如机器房领工王秀魁等）很大的帮助，终于试验成功。井下运煤从此将更方便迅速。因为做铁钩只用一根量好尺寸的铁棍一弯就得了。做一根铁链条的工夫，可以做十根铁棍。今后不特西山矿改用铁棍，并建议门头沟各矿亦研究改用。
