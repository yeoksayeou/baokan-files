　　Romanian Communist Party – The Romanian Communist Party led the national patriotic forces, prompting Romania to begin to break away from its partnership with Hitler on August 23, 1944, and turn its guns against Hitler. Since then, it has become the center of Romania's democratic forces. The Romanian Communist Party led the united front formed by the Social Democratic Party and the Peasants' Front, and successively overthrew the two reactionary governments of Sonaruscu (supported by reactionary soldiers) and Radicescu (linked to US and British imperialism) from August 1944 to March of the following year. On March 6, 1945, a democratic coalition government was formed with Groza (leader of the Peasants' Front within the united front) as prime minister. In this government, the Romanian Communist Party implemented land reform, mobilized the people to participate in the anti-Hitler war, eliminated domestic fascists, and restored the national economy. In the new government elected in 1946, the Romanian Communist Party served as minister of the Interior, Justice, Transportation, and Industry and Commerce, and announced a program to improve finance and the economy; democratic decrees on agricultural reform; purged fascist elements and corrupt officials from state organs, and then launched a struggle against the reactionary National Peasants' Party, dissolved the National Peasants' Party, tried the party's reactionary leader Maniu, and foiled the National Peasants' Party's conspiracy to launch armed intervention by American imperialism. In February 1948, after the Romanian Communist Party merged with the Social Democratic Party (after purging the right-wing elements), it became the largest party in the country, with 710,000 members at that time, of which 44 percent were workers and 39 percent were peasants.

　　Gurkha Troops – Are a reactionary armed force organized by British imperialism to invade and slaughter the people of Malaya. The soldiers of this reactionary armed force are not British but Gurkhas. The Gurkhas have always lived in the mountains of India and are a backward minority in India, with a fierce and combative character. The reactionary British government used threats and inducements to form the Gurkhas into an army, and after transporting them to Malaya, they were commanded by British officers and driven to serve as the vanguard of the British army in slaughtering the people of Malaya. Not only that, in November last year (1948), in order to enter deep into the mountains and jungles to slaughter the people of Malaya, Britain also transported 200 Dayaks from Sarasak in Borneo (the Dayaks are uncivilized savages who still practice cannibalism) to carry out the "jungle warfare" plan touted by Britain, but the result will still greatly disappoint British imperialism.

    罗马尼亚共产党——罗马尼亚共产党领导全国爱国力量，促使罗国于一九四四年八月二十三日开始脱离希特勒伙伴的地位，而掉转枪口反对希特勒，此后，就成了罗国民主势力的中心。罗共领导社会民主党、农民阵线结成的统一战线，于一九四四年八月至第二年三月，连续推倒了孙拿特斯克（是反动军人支持起来的）、拉吉斯科（与美英帝国主义有联系）两个反动政府，于一九四五年三月六日组成了以格罗查（统一战线内农民阵线领袖）为总理的民主联合政府，罗共在这个政府中推行了土地改革；发动人民参加反希特勒战争；清除国内法西斯分子；恢复全国经济等工作。一九四六年在选举产生的新政府中，罗共担任了内务、司法、交通、工商等部的部长，公布了改善财政经济的纲领；关于农业改革的民主法令；清洗了国家机关的法西斯分子和贪污分子，继而开展了和反动的国家农民党的斗争，解散了国家农民党，审讯了这个党的反动首领曼立武，粉碎了国家农民党企图发动美国帝国主义武装干涉的阴谋。一九四八年二月，罗共与社会民主党（清除了右翼分子以后的）实行合并后，遂成了全国第一大党，当时拥有的七十一万党员有百分之四十四是工人；百分之三十九是农民。
    廓尔喀部队——是英国帝国主义为了侵略与残杀马来亚人民而组织的一支反动武装。这支反动武装的士兵，不是英国人而是廓尔喀人。廓尔喀人一向住在印度的山里，是印度的一个落后的少数民族，有强悍好斗的性格，反动的英国政府，就利用威胁、利诱的办法，把廓尔喀人组成军队，运到马来亚以后，在英国军官指挥下，驱使他们在英国军队的前边担任屠杀马来亚人民的任务。不仅如此，去年（一九四八）十一月，英国为了进入深山丛林中去屠杀马来亚人民，还曾经从婆罗洲的萨拉沙克运去二百名达雅克人（达雅克人是未开化、还流行着吃人风俗的野蛮人），进行英国所吹嘘的“丛林战”计划，但结果依然会使英帝国主义大大失望的。
