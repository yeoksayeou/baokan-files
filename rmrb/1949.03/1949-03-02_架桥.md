　　Building a Bridge
    On New Year's Eve, Instructor Peng of a certain company of the Northwest Field Army gathered the troops in the yard and said happily: "Comrades! Tomorrow is the New Year, but today the higher authorities have given our company a task - to build the Luoyang River bridge that was destroyed by the enemy. Do you feel any difficulty going into the water?" The comrades all knew that building this bridge was of great importance to advancing and eliminating the bandit Hu Zongnan, so they almost unanimously said: "We have no difficulties!" Some comrades even said: "For the sake of killing the enemy and avenging our comrades, we dare to jump into a fire pit."
    "Only three squads are needed, which three squads should go?" As soon as Instructor Peng finished speaking, the soldiers began to speak up. Wang Huaijin of the Fourth Squad rushed to speak first, he said: "The higher authorities didn't give us a task in the last battle, this time you must let us go!" A comrade from the First Squad disagreed: "Our First Squad is tall and good at diving, the comrades in the Fourth Squad are not strong enough." Then, the Third Squad and some other squads also clamored to go, and it became noisy. Finally, after a decision by the instructor and the deputy company commander: The First, Third, and Fourth Squads will undertake the glorious task of building the bridge.
    On the morning of New Year's Day, the northwest wind howled wildly, and it felt like a knife scraping your face. Touching your nose, it seemed that your nose was not your own. At this time, more than thirty warriors had arrived at the bridge and started working. The first step was to dismantle the remaining bridge. "Boom! Boom! Boom!" With three loud explosions, the frozen remains of the bridge were overturned by three hand grenades. One piece of wood after another floated horizontally and vertically in the flowing water. In order not to let the water wash away a single piece of wood, the comrades, regardless of their cotton coats and trousers being soaked, dragged one piece of water-soaked wood after another ashore.
    The bridge building began, and one comrade jumped into the water with a splash, and another comrade rolled up his jacket and followed him. Other comrades also scrambled to jump into the water, and later the deputy company commander decided on a method of rotating squads. After this squad worked in the water for a certain period of time, they came ashore to warm themselves by the fire and apply oil, and then another squad went down, alternating in this way from squad to squad. Although the rushing Luoyang River mixed with ice floes made it difficult to stand, the new bridge quickly stood upright under the comrades' intense labor. In seven days, a bridge forty meters long and four meters wide was completed.

　　架桥
    除夕那天，西北野战军某连彭指导员把队伍集合在院里，快乐地说：“同志们！明天就要过年了，可是今天上级给我连一个任务一一架起被敌人破坏的洛河大桥。你们感到下水有困难吗？”同志们都知道，架起这座大桥，与进军消灭胡匪宗南是有很大关系的，于是他们几乎是异口同声地说：“咱们没有什么困难！”有些同志还说：“为了杀敌报仇，火坑也敢跳。”
    “只要三个班去就够了，让那三个班去呢？”彭指导员的话刚说完，战士们就争着发言。四班王怀金抢着了先，他说：“上次战斗上级没给咱们任务，这次可得让我们去哪！”一班一位同志表示不同意：“我们一班个子大，好跳水，四班同志身体不行。”接着，三班和其他有些班也都争着要去，吵嚷开来了。最后经指导员与副连长决定：一、三、四班担负架桥的光荣任务。
    元旦早晨，西北风呼呼地狂吹，吹到脸上就象刀子在刮一样。手摸在鼻子上，似乎鼻子也不是自己的了。这时，三十多位勇士已来到桥边，开始工作。第一步是拆去残桥。“轰！轰！轰！”三声巨响，那座被冻硬了的残桥被三个手雷炸翻了、一根一根的木头横横直直地在流水中漂浮着。为了不让水冲走一根木头，同志们不顾自己的棉衣马裤被湿透，一根又一根地把水淋淋的木头都拖上岸来。
    开始架桥了，一位同志扑通一声就跳下水去了，另一同志把袄一卷也跟着下去，其他同志也都争先下水，后来由副连长决定各班轮流的办法。当这个班在水里工作了一定时间后，上岸来烤烤火，擦擦油，让另一个班又下去，这样一班一班的交替着。虽然洛水激流夹杂着冰块的冲击令人难以站住脚，但在同志们紧张的劳动下，新的桥梁很快就直竖起来了，七天工夫，一座长四十米，宽四米的大桥全部告成了。
