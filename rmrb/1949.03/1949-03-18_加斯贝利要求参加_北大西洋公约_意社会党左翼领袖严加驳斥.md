Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, March 16th: According to TASS, Rome: On March 11th, Italian Prime Minister Gasperi requested the Chamber of Deputies to authorize the government to negotiate with representatives of eight countries in Washington on Italy's participation in the North Atlantic Treaty. Gasperi did not submit to the Chamber of Deputies any materials regarding the government's diplomatic activities or the content of the North Atlantic Treaty itself. Gasperi's statement only stated that the Cabinet meeting "unanimously approved participation in the North Atlantic Treaty." He requested the Chamber of Deputies to take a decision as soon as possible so that the government could participate in the "final formulation negotiations" of the North Atlantic Treaty clauses. After Gasperi's statement, Nenni, the left-wing leader of the Socialist Party, stood up and stated that Gasperi's speech was "the culmination of two years of lying and deception." Nenni pointed out that the government had repeatedly stated that it would never undertake military obligations. However, the government has today shed its mask. Nenni suggested immediately passing a resolution to dismiss Foreign Minister Sforza from his post, and requested him to attend the Foreign Affairs Committee of the Chamber of Deputies to provide all materials related to the diplomatic policy measures he had taken. Nenni concluded by saying that the North Atlantic Treaty is "a tool of war," just like the "Pact of Steel" signed by Hitler and Mussolini in the past. Italian Communist Party leader Togliatti supported Nenni's request. He emphasized that the government has an obligation to provide all necessary explanations for taking important steps that only deepen the division and contradictions in international relations. After Nenni and Togliatti spoke, the government rejected Nenni's proposal to convene the Foreign Affairs Committee of the Chamber of Deputies by a vote of 311 to 165.

　　加斯贝利要求参加“北大西洋公约”
    意社会党左翼领袖严加驳斥
    【新华社陕北十六日电】据塔斯社罗马讯：三月十一日，意大利总理加斯贝利，要求下院授权政府在华盛顿与八国代表谈判意大利参加北大西洋公约问题。加斯贝利并未向下院提出关于政府外交活动或关于北大西洋公约本身条款内容的任何材料，加斯贝利的声明仅称：内阁会议“一致赞成参加北大西洋公约”。他要求下院尽早采取决定，使政府可以参加北大西洋公约条款之“最后制定的谈判”。加斯贝利声明之后，社会党左翼领袖南尼起立发言称：加斯贝利的发言，是“集两年来说谎欺骗政策之大成”。南尼指出：政府曾一再申述它决不承担军事义务。但是，政府今天挑下了假面具。南尼建议立即通过决议，解除外长史佛卓的职务；要他出席下院外交委员会，提供有关他所采取的外交政策措施的一切材料。南尼最后说：北大西洋公约是“战争的工具”，正如希特勒和墨索里尼在过去签订的“钢约”一样。意共领袖托格里亚蒂支持南尼的要求，他着重指出，政府有义务提供打算采取重要步骤的一切必要解释，这些步骤仅仅加深国际关系的分裂与矛盾。在南尼与托格里亚蒂发言以后，政府以三一一票否决了南尼所提要求召开下院外交委员会的建议，赞成南尼提案者一六五票。
