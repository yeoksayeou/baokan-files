Taihang Trading Company Instructs Northern Henan General Store
    Organize Disaster Victims to Spin and Weave for Self-Relief
    [Taihang Telegraph] The Taihang Trading Company recently instructed the Fourth Special District General Store to immediately organize the people of the Northern Henan New District to carry out production for self-relief on the basis of existing cotton weaving. In the triangle area of Xinxiang, Huixian, and Ji County in the Northern Henan New District (liberated in November last year), the cotton weaving industry (mainly weaving foreign cloth) was quite developed before the War of Resistance Against Japanese Aggression. There were more than 1,500 looms, producing about 1,000 bolts of cloth per day, and many people depended on it for their livelihoods. Since the Japanese invaders occupied the area, the textile industry has been subjected to all kinds of devastation; after 1942, locust plagues and floods occurred year after year; after 1945, it suffered from Chiang Kai-shek's extortion and exploitation, and the textile industry almost completely collapsed, resulting in serious famine. At present, there are more than 40,000 disaster victims in Ji County alone, and the masses are urgently demanding to restore production to overcome the disaster. To this end, the Taihang Trading Company specifically instructed the Fourth Special District General Store to immediately organize the people in the area to carry out production for self-relief: (1) Exchange cotton for yarn with yarn factories, and then distribute the yarn to weaving households, paying wages of 30 to 35 catties of wheat for each bolt of cloth woven (104 feet long, 2.6 feet wide, and 10.5 catties in weight). For small factories, a free exchange method can be adopted to provide assistance. (2) In this work, the small-scale weaving households should be gradually organized to establish supply and marketing cooperatives, so as to unify supply and management, and lay the foundation for the future development of supply and marketing cooperatives. (3) The cloth produced shall be sold uniformly by the Fourth District General Store to Zhengzhou, Luoyang, Kaifeng and other places to open up the sales channels for the cloth. (4) This work should be taken as the central business of the branch store this spring, and it should be fully organized and implemented.

　　太行贸易公司指示豫北总店
    组织灾民纺织自救
    【太行电】太行贸易公司顷指示四专区总店，立即组织豫北新区人民，在旧有棉织基础上进行生产自救。豫北新区新（乡）辉（县）汲（县）三角地带（去年十一月解放），抗战前棉织业（主要织洋布）相当发达，共有布机一千五百多架，日产布一千匹左右，很多人依此为生。自日寇占领后，纺织业受到百般摧残；一九四二年后，蝗灾水灾，连年不断；一九四五年以后，又遭蒋匪的敲榨勒索，纺织业几乎全部垮台，造成了严重的灾荒。现只汲县灾民即有四万多人，群众迫切要求恢复生产，以渡灾荒。为此，太行贸易公司特指示四专区总店立即组织该地区人民进行生产自救：（一）用棉花与纱厂交换纱，再将纱分配给织布户，每织一匹布（长一百零四尺，宽二尺六寸，重十斤半）发给工资小麦三十斤至三十五斤。对小型工厂，可采用自由交换方式加以扶助。（二）在这一工作中，要将小生产的织布户，逐步组织起来，成立供销合作社，以便统一供给与管理，并可打下今后发展供销合作社的基础。（三）所产之布，由四分区总店统一向郑州、洛阳、开封等地推销，以打开布的销路。（四）将这一工作，作为分店今春中心业务，以全力组织进行。
