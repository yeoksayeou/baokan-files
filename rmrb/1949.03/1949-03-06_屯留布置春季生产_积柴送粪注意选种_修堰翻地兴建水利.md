    Tunliu Arranges Spring Production
    Accumulate Firewood and Deliver Manure, Pay Attention to Seed Selection, Repair Weirs, Turn Over Land, and Build Water Conservancy Projects
    [Report from this newspaper] According to the spirit of the Taiyue Prefecture's spring production instructions and in light of the actual conditions in Tunliu County, the county government has formulated a specific implementation plan for the early stage of spring production: (1) Accumulate fertilizer and deliver manure, accumulate coal and firewood, and repair farm tools – It is stipulated that two-thirds of the accumulated manure should be transported out by the end of February. Promote mutual assistance and implement labor exchange between people and animals for delivering manure. Encourage several households to jointly build a kiln to hold grass ash, and massively produce smoked fertilizer, while continuing to collect manure from stables. Areas lacking fuel should accumulate a large amount of firewood so that there will be firewood to burn during the busy farming season. In addition, seize the time to repair and build farm tools. Each district should support iron and woodworking factories in a planned way. Farm tools that a single household cannot afford to purchase can be bought jointly by the masses. (2) To ensure successful production, cadres going to the countryside must help each household formulate a production plan. This should be carried out on the basis of the masses' conscious and voluntary participation, without any coercion. To improve agriculture, each village should establish an agricultural technology research committee to promote improved varieties, eliminate pests, and increase yields.
    In March, the county has formulated the following key production tasks: (1) Rectify mutual aid organizations – They must be organized on the basis of enlightening, inducing, and persuading the masses to participate consciously and voluntarily, starting with small-scale labor exchange. (2) Water conservancy work: First, restore the original five old canals, which are expected to be completed by March 15th. In addition, repair the waterwheels in Changcun and other villages. To complete the above tasks, each village should conduct specific investigations. If they feel that they lack funds, the government can provide loans to help. As for the hillside areas, seize the time to repair and tidy up the field embankments. The autumn-harvested land should be universally harrowed once in March. For uncultivated land, organize people and animals to exchange labor to turn over the land. In March, one-half of the county's wheat fields should be hoed once. (3) Rectify cooperatives and launch a campaign to buy livestock – First, rectify the cooperatives in Wuyuan in the third district and Sidi in the second district, absorb experience, and then promote it. Launch a campaign to buy livestock, explain and interpret to break the masses' ideological concerns. If they cannot afford to buy at once, they can organize joint purchases. (4) Planting trees: The county nursery has 70,000 saplings. Each district should collect them by March 25th according to the assigned numbers. Distribute them to the villages for planting, mainly mobilizing the masses to find their own saplings, at least one tree per person. Each village should formulate specific forest protection agreements to prohibit cattle and sheep from grazing and children from climbing and breaking branches.
    In order to ensure that we help the families of revolutionary martyrs and soldiers to cultivate their land well, each village must regard the work of giving preferential treatment to the families of revolutionary martyrs and soldiers as one of the key tasks. It is necessary to overcome the past practices in some villages of deliberately reducing the number of substitute labor days under the pretext of self-reporting and public discussion and failing to adequately take care of the production of the families of revolutionary martyrs and soldiers. In the spirit of "when drinking water, don't forget the well digger," ensure that the work of giving preferential treatment to military families is done well.
    Leaders at all levels must implement the system of division of labor and responsibility between county, district, and village cadres, promote the overall situation based on key villages, report regularly, and fully play the leading role of village cadres.

    【本报讯】太岳屯留县政府根据专署的春季生产指示的精神，联系该县实际情况，作出春季初期的具体实施计划：（一）积肥送粪、积煤积柴、修理农具——规定在二月底，要把已积下的粪肥运出三分之二，发扬互助，实行人畜拨工送粪，提倡几户合垒一个装草灰的窑洞，大量制造熏肥与继续拾粪势圈。缺燃料的地区要大量的积柴，以便在农忙时有柴烧，此外要抓紧时间补造农具，各区有计划的扶植铁木工厂，单独一户购置不起的农具，可发动群众伙买。（二）为了保证作好生产，下乡干部要很好帮助各户订立生产计划。要在群众自觉自愿的基础上进行，不能有任何的强迫因素。为了改进农业，各村要成立农业技术研究委员会，以便推广优良品种，消除害虫，以增加产量。
    三月份，该县制订如下生产工作重点：（一）整顿互助组织——必须在启发诱导与说服群众自觉自愿的基础上组织起来，要从小型的变工拨工做起。（二）水利工作：首先要恢复原有的五条旧渠，预计在三月十五日可完工，此外要把常村等村的水车修复起来，完成以上任务，各村应作具体调查工作，如感资力不足时，政府可以贷粮款扶助。至于山坡地区，要抓紧时间，修整地堰，把秋茬地在三月份内要普遍的耙一遍，未耕地，要组织人畜变工进行翻地，三月份要把全县麦地普锄二分之一。（三）整顿合作社，突击买牲口——首先整顿三区吾元、二区寺底两村的合作社，吸收经验，以便推广。发动买牲口，要宣传解释，打破群众思想顾虑，一时买不起，可组织伙买。（四）植树：县上苗圃有七万株树秧，各区在三月二十五日以前按分配数字领回。分发各村栽植，主要是发动群众自找树秧，至少一人一树，各村制订具体的护林公约，禁止牛羊啃嚼及儿童攀折。
    为了保证帮助烈军干属把地种好，各村必须把优待烈军干属工作，当成重点工作之一，要克服过去一部分村庄，借口自报公议，故意减低代耕工数不适当照顾烈军干属生产的作法，要本着吃水不忘打井人的精神，保证把优待军属工作做好。
    各级领导，必须贯彻县、区、村干部分工负责制，依据重点村，推动全面，定期汇报，充分发挥村干部的领导作用。
