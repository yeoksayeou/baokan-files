[Jizhong Electric] After the liberation of Baoding, the People's Bank of China established close relations with the citizens of Baoding, thus enabling the industry and commerce of the city, which had been devastated by the Chiang Kai-shek bandits, to recover. Since the liberation of the city, the Baoding Office of the People's Bank of China has conducted a survey of the industrial and commercial situation. It was decided to support six industries that are beneficial to the national economy and the people's livelihood, such as iron, electric mills, oil, coal, and groceries, by providing necessary loans. The state-owned Baoding Electric Light Company resumed power transmission, and the iron factory and Yufeng Textile Factory resumed production. Comrade Li Hao, director of the state-owned Baoding Iron Factory, said: "When the factory was taken over, it only had machines, and no raw materials or funds. Thanks to the support of the bank, the machines are running, and the workers have food to eat. We are manufacturing weaving machines, sock knitting machines, and agricultural implements." After obtaining loans from the bank, the iron factories in the Beihepo area dug out tools from the ruins burned by the enemy, built houses, and began to manufacture waterwheels and agricultural implements. The Fuhe Xing Waterwheel Factory was unable to operate due to the destruction by the Chiang Kai-shek bandits. At the time of Japan's surrender, the factory still had more than 30 workers and more than 30 tons of foreign iron. By November of last year, only three workers and three tons of foreign iron remained. When the Chiang Kai-shek bandits fled, they burned down seven houses. After receiving a loan from the bank, the factory dug out bricks, tiles, and wood from the rubble, built new houses, and now has increased to ten workers. Deyu Hou Mill used to grind two stones of wheat daily with electricity, but before liberation, due to losses, it was reduced to six pecks with a small donkey. It has now borrowed 20,000 yuan from the bank and restored the electric mill. When production loans were first issued in the third and fourth districts, the guidance of combining production technology was ignored. Under the pretext of the government's instructions to provide loans urgently, the organization of production was relaxed, so that many of the citizens' loans were not used for production, but for operating consumer goods. This has since been noted and improved. The Baoding Office of the People's Bank of China has also played a significant role in developing and expanding state-owned enterprises and cooperating with trade companies to stabilize prices. There were two price fluctuations in Baoding. At this time, the bank used chips tightly and actively absorbed deposits from all parties. First of all, it provided great convenience to depositors, allowing lump-sum deposits and withdrawals in installments, and collection and payment on behalf of others. Manager Yu of the trade company said: "The bank has become our general accountant, collecting and paying on behalf of us, saving us a lot of cadres." In the past two months, the bank has received a total of 1,158,286 yuan (RMB) in public and private deposits. The Baoding Office of the bank has also successively handled interbank remittances with Shijiazhuang, Xingtai, Nangong, Xinji, Bozhen, Tianjin and other places. By the 20th, a total of 157,556 yuan was remitted out, and 87,764 yuan was remitted in, promoting material and financial exchanges between the liberated areas.

　　中国人民银行保定办事处
    贷款扶持生产建设
  　办理存款汇兑促进物资交流
    【冀中电】保定解放以后，中国人民银行即与保定市民建立了密切的关系，从而使该市被蒋匪摧残殆尽之工商业获得了恢复。中国人民银行保定办事处，自该市解放后即进行了工商业情况的调查。确定扶植有益于国计民生之铁、电磨、油、煤杂货等六种行业，施以必要的贷款。国营保定电灯公司恢复送电，铁工厂、裕丰纺织厂恢复了生产。国营保定铁工厂厂长李浩同志诉谈：“本厂接收时只有机器，原料资金一无所有，由于银行的扶植，机器开动了，工人有了饭吃，我们正在制造织布机、织袜机、农具。”北河坡一带的铁工厂，在获得银行贷款后，已从被敌人烧毁的废墟中挖出了工具，修建了房屋，开始制造水车农具。福和兴水车厂在刚解放时，已被蒋匪摧残的不能经营了，该厂在日本投降时还有三十多个工人，三十多吨洋铁，到去年十一月只剩下三个工人，三吨洋铁，蒋匪逃窜时，把七间房子烧毁。该厂得到银行贷款后，从瓦砾中挖出砖、瓦、木料，盖起新房，现已增到十个工人。德裕厚磨坊，从前用电力每日磨麦两石，到解放前因亏累用小驴磨降到六斗。现已从银行贷款两万元，恢复了电磨。开始在三、四区发放生产贷款时，忽视了结合生产技术的指导，借口政府指示急贷，致放松了掌握组织生产，以致市民的贷款，很多并未进行生产，而经营消费品。嗣后已引起注意改进。人民银行保定办事处在发展扩大国营企业，配合贸易公司平抑物价上，也起了很大作用。保定市物价曾发生过两次的波动，银行于此时紧用筹码，主动的吸收各方面的存款。首先给存款者很大方便。整存零取，代收代付。贸易公司余经理说：“银行成了我们的总会计，代收代付，节省我们很多干部。”两个月来，银行共收公私各种存款一百一十五万八千二百八十六元（人民币）。该银行保定市办事处并先后与石家庄、邢台、南宫、辛集、泊镇、天津等地银行办理了通汇。到二十日共汇出十五万七千五百五十六元，汇入八万七千七百六十四元，促进了解放区各城市物资金融交流。
