(Taiyue Electric) The Jincheng City Government convened a meeting of managers of state-owned enterprises and public-owned stores operating in the city from February 4th to 6th. Nineteen managers from various units attended. The meeting focused on reviewing the deviation of insufficient understanding of the leading role of the state-owned economy in the market, and criticized the improper practices of some units in business, such as sometimes competing to purchase, facilitating private merchants' speculation, and stimulating price increases. When prices fluctuated, various units could not act in unison and use the strength of the public-owned economy in a planned way to stabilize prices. On the contrary, some units took the opportunity to engage in speculative trading, which affected sharp price fluctuations and damaged the interests of small producers and consumers. For example, Jinfeng Automobile Company, in January, learned that cotton prices in Handan, Changzhi and other places were rising, so it grabbed a handful in Jincheng, competing to buy cotton, buying from private stores, and also competing to buy more than 2,000 kilograms from the County Federation of Cooperatives and Jinhexing and other public-owned stores. Litaifang Store did the same, resulting in a sharp rise in cotton prices. The reason for these phenomena, everyone believed, was mainly: some units were dominated by the self-centered view of seeking profits, and their understanding of the role that state-owned enterprises and public-owned stores should play in leading the market was vague. Manager Yao of Yongcheng Cooperative said: "In the past, public-owned stores speculated against each other, as long as they grabbed it and made money. When prices fluctuated, instead of exchanging information and unifying steps to stabilize prices, they kept secrets and rushed to buy. As a result, the public and the masses suffered, and only the speculative merchants benefited." When discussing how to improve specifically in the future, everyone believed that the problem should first be solved from the ideological understanding of the staff. It was decided that the staff of each unit must study the general agency's editorial on the "Linqing Incident," accept the lessons of the "Linqing Incident," and improve the theory of state-owned economic cadres. From the 10th to the 20th, they will study for ten days specifically. It was also proposed that the activities of various units in Jincheng in the market should have unified organizational leadership in order to achieve centralized leadership and control of the market. The city government immediately decided to establish the Jincheng City Market Management Committee, composed of 13 representatives from various industrial, commercial, and financial departments directly under the city government, the city Public Security Bureau, the Chamber of Commerce, public-owned enterprises, and stores. Comrade Wang Yaonan, the mayor, serves as the chairman of the committee. The main tasks of the committee are to strengthen leadership and management of the market, grasp price trends, give play to the leading role of the state-owned economy, use economic forces to regulate supply and demand, and stabilize prices, so as to stimulate various productions. The association was formally established on February 10.

　　晋城成立集市管理委员会
  　调剂供求平稳物价
    【太岳电】晋城市政府在二月四日到六日，召集在本市经营的国营企业、公营商店经理会议，出席的有各单位经理十九人。会上着重检讨了对国营经济在市场上领导作用认识不足的偏向，批判了某些单位在营业上有时互相争购，便利私商投机，刺激物价上涨的不正当的做法。在物价波动时，各单位不能步调一致，有计划地运用公营经济的力量，平稳物价。相反，有些单位却趁机做起投机买卖，影响物价急剧波动，打击了小生产者和消费者的利益。如晋丰汽车公司，一月份知道了邯郸、长治等地棉价抬头，就在晋市抓了一把，争买棉花，把私人商店的买了，又向县联社、晋合祥等公营商店争买了二千多斤。利太商店也是这样，以致弄得棉价暴涨。产生这些现象的原因，大家认为主要是：有些单位单图营利的本位观点作怪，对国营企业与公营商店领导市场应起的作用，认识模糊。永盛合作社姚经理说：“过去公营商店之间，是互相投机，只要抓到自己手里，赚了钱就行。在物价波动时，不是互通情报，统一步调，平稳物价，而是保守秘密，争先抢购。结果吃亏的还是公家和群众，只是便宜了投机商人。”在讨论到今后如何具体改进时，大家认为首先应从工作人员思想认识上解决问题。决定各单位工作人员，必须学习总社关于“临清事件”的社论，接受“临清事件”的教训，提高国营经济干部的理论。从十日到二十日，专门学习十天。并且提出：晋市的各单位在市场上活动，要有统一的组织领导，以便取得集中领导和掌握市场。市政府当即决定成立晋城市集市管理委员会，由市政府直属的各工商、财经部门、市公安局、商联会、公营企业、商店代表共十三人组成。市长王耀南同志任主任委员。委员会主要任务为加强领导和管理市场，掌握物价动向，发挥国营经济的领导作用，运用经济力量，调剂供求，平稳物价，以便刺激各种生产。该会已在二月十日正式成立。
