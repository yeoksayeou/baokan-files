　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 16th:
　　Electroneews Agency, Rome: The Italian Socialist Party published a strong statement in its newspaper "Avanti!", refuting the recent ultimatum from the International Socialist Committee. The ultimatum unreasonably demanded that the Italian Socialist Party change its policy of cooperation with the Communist Party, and stated that if proof of this change was not received before March 20, the International Socialist Committee would inevitably expel the Italian Socialist Party. The Italian Socialist Party stated in its declaration: "We want to tell you: The Italian Socialist Party will not change its established policy one bit before March 20th."
　　
　　Another report: The International Socialist Committee is scheduled to hold a meeting in the Netherlands from May 14th to 16th, with the main agenda being to plan the establishment of a "European Unity Bureau" and how to conduct deceptive propaganda regarding the North Atlantic Treaty. A special meeting will also be held in April to study the so-called "Nenni problem" and the Italian Socialist Party's statement. Philip Noel-Baker, the British Labour Party secretary who plays a leading role in the International Socialist Committee, revealed that the reason for the rapid discussion of the so-called "Nenni problem" is that the cooperation between the Italian Socialist Party and the Communist Party will hinder the Italian ruling group from participating in the North Atlantic Treaty.

　　意国社会党发表声明
  　继续与共产党合作
    驳斥国际委会的分裂通谍
    【新华社陕北十六日电】电通社罗马讯：意大利社会党在该党机关报“前进报”上发表强力声明，驳斥国际社会党委员会最近致该党的最后通谍。通谍无理要求意大利社会党改变他们和共产党合作的政策，并且，假如在三月二十日前未得到这一改变的证明，国际社会党委员会将不可避免地开除意大利社会党。意大利社会党在声明中说：“我们要告诉你们：意大利社会党在三月二十日以前，不会改变一点既定政策的方针”。
    又讯：国际社会党委员会定于五月十四日至十六日在荷兰举行会议，主要议程为计划建立“欧洲统一局”及如何进行关于北大西洋公约的欺骗宣传。四月份并将举行特别会议，以研究所谓“南尼问题”及意大利社会党的这次声明。在国际社会党委员会中起主导作用的英国工党书记菲力浦曾透露：要迅速讨论所谓“南尼问题”的原因，是因为意大利社会党和共产党的合作将妨碍意大利统治集团参加北大西洋公约。
