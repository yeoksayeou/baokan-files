[Zhangjiakou Electric Dispatch] Due to the excessive exploitation of workers during the Kuomintang bandit regime, wages in some enterprises and departments were too low. Even with maintaining the original positions and salaries, the majority of workers were unable to sustain a minimum standard of living. To address this, the Enterprise Takeover Group of the Zhangjiakou Military Control Commission, in consultation with the Chahar Provincial People's Government, conducted thorough and careful investigations and research. On the 22nd of this month, they announced temporary wage subsidies and individual adjustments for workers in state-owned and public enterprises taken over by the Enterprise Takeover Group in Zhangjiakou, Xuanhua, and Xiahuayuan. The measures stipulate that: common laborers and technicians in all units under the former North China Iron and Steel Company's Longyan Iron Mine will receive a subsidy of 100% of their original wages; the wages of technicians and common laborers in the former Jibei Electric Power Company's Chazhong Branch and its affiliated Zhangjiakou and Xiahuayuan Power Plants will remain unchanged; common laborers and technicians in the former Chahar Provincial Electric Power Administration will receive a maximum subsidy of 60% of their original wages; and common laborers and technicians in all units under the former Chahar Provincial Enterprise Company will receive a subsidy of 70% of their original wages. The monthly wages of apprentices in all units will be adjusted to the equivalent of 120 to 180 catties of millet; the monthly wages of guards and janitors will be adjusted to the equivalent of 150 to 200 catties of millet; and the monthly wage of custodians in non-operational units, with no other tasks, will generally be adjusted to the equivalent of 120 to 180 catties of millet, with exceptions made for special cases. This temporary subsidy and individual adjustment measure is one of the most important industrial and labor policy measures taken by the Zhangjiakou Military Control Commission and the Chahar Provincial People's Government since the re-liberation of Zhangjiakou and Xuanhua. During the Kuomintang bandit regime's rule of Zhangjiakou and Xuanhua, workers in heavy industries such as the Longyan Iron Mine, even leading workers at the mine level, who engaged in heavy labor all day long, could only earn the equivalent of 173 catties of millet per month (hereinafter the same); technicians earned no more than 143 catties, and common laborers earned no more than 113 catties, with common laborers at the third grade earning only 98 catties of millet per month. Technicians in the Chahar Provincial Enterprise Company earned a maximum of 201 catties and a minimum of 123 catties; common laborers earned a maximum of 144 catties and a minimum of 102 catties. The monthly income of ordinary technicians and common laborers was barely enough to support themselves, let alone their families. With this subsidy, the livelihood of ordinary workers will be initially guaranteed.

　　张宣两市照顾工人生活困难
    实行工资临时贴补
    【张垣电】由于国民党匪帮统治时期对于工人过高的压榨，有些企业部门，工资过低，虽按照原职原薪，大部工人仍不能维持最低生活；为此，张家口军事管制委员会企业接管组商同察哈尔省人民政府，经过详密慎重的考察研究，于本月二十二日公布了二月份张家口、宣化、下花园三地由企业接管组所接管之各国营、公营企业工人薪资临时贴补及个别调整办法。该办法规定：原华北钢铁公司龙烟铁矿所属各单位普工、技工，贴补原工资的百分之百；原冀北电力公司察中支公司及其所属张家口、下花园发电厂技工、普工工资一概不动；原察哈尔省电力管理局普工、技工于原工资上最高贴补百分之六十；原察哈尔省企业公司所属各单位普工、技工一律于原工资上贴补百分之七十。各单位学徒月资一律调整至小米一百二十斤至一百八十斤；警卫、勤杂人员月资，一律调整至小米一百五十斤至二百斤；未复工单位之看管人员无其他任务者，一般的调到月资小米一百二十斤至一百八十斤。特殊者例外。这一临时贴补及个别调整办法，是张家口军事管制委员会与察哈尔省人民政府于张、宣重获解放后，在工业与职工政策上最重要的措施之一。国民党匪帮统治张、宣期间，象龙烟铁矿这样的重工业中，按矿所一级领班工人终日进行沉重的劳动，月资仅能领得小米一百七十三斤（下同），技工最多不超过一百四十三斤，普工最高不超过一百一十三斤，普工三级每月仅能获得九十八斤小米。察哈尔省企业公司技工，最高者二百零一斤，最低者一百二十三斤；普工最高者一百四十四斤，最低者一百零二斤；一般技工、普工每月所得养活自己尚感不足，更无力瞻养家中老小。经过此种贴补，一般工人生活将获得初步保证。
