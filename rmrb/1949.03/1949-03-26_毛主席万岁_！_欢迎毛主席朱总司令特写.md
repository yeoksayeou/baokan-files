"Long Live Chairman Mao!"
　　Special Report Welcoming Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu

　　On March 25, 1949, the leader of the Chinese people, Chairman Mao, arrived in Beiping. The people of Beiping felt immense honor and pride in Chairman Mao's arrival. Representatives from the Party, government, military, and civilians in Beiping, along with more than 160 democratic figures, went to the West Suburb Airport to welcome him.

　　At 5:00 PM, Chairman Mao, Commander-in-Chief Zhu, Liu Shaoqi, Zhou Enlai, Ren Bishi, Lin Boqu, and other comrades... entered the West Suburb Airport. General Lin Biao, General Nie Rongzhen, and General He Long immediately stepped forward to greet them. Military music played loudly, and tens of thousands of people cheered in unison, "Long Live Chairman Mao," "Long Live Commander-in-Chief Zhu"... At the forefront of the welcoming line were worker representatives. Many veteran workers who had endured long revolutionary struggles had already graying hair. Chairman Mao shook hands with them one by one, and many people held Chairman Mao's hand tightly. The working class united with their leader, what a warm and moving scene that was!

　　Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu walked to the front of the women's representatives. Li Xiuzhen, a representative of women from North China, shook hands with Chairman Mao for half a minute. Under the leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, she had stood up. Through long-term revolutionary struggles, she had become a model of supporting the army and production. She had risked her life many times, using highly alert actions to deliver intelligence to the People's Liberation Army, and had dedicated her only son to the revolution. When she recounted her heroic deeds of the past at the First National Women's Congress, she resolutely stated that she would work to the end with all working women under the leadership of Chairman Mao. Now that she had seen Chairman Mao with her own eyes, her aging face was flushed with excitement.

　　Chairman Mao and his entourage shook hands and exchanged pleasantries with the democratic figures one by one. Li Jishen, Shen Junru, Huang Yanpei, Guo Moruo... all met. Everyone exchanged greetings and wished each other good health. Many gentlemen laughed and talked, unable to close their mouths for a long time.

　　A flare rose into the sky, and the military parade officially began. Chairman Mao boarded the first light green jeep, and Commander-in-Chief Zhu, Comrade Liu Shaoqi... also boarded vehicles in turn, slowly passing through the long lines of the People's Liberation Army. Fifty 60mm mortars fired 500 flares in succession, and half the sky was filled with glittering stars. The audience applauded in unison, and the cheers shook the sky. Here were rows of tanks, with red flags fluttering on them. The tank crews wore neat military uniforms and saluted their leader in unison. Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu returned the salute with smiles, expressing infinite joy. Here were rows of anti-aircraft guns, howitzers, and heavy artillery. Many cannons that had made special contributions were adorned with various award flags. Here was a mechanized force, with uniform cars and uniform equipment. The soldiers were uniformly majestic and heroic. They fought from the Northeast to North China, and soon they would fight to South China. The people relied on them and achieved this glorious victory today. Here were the invincible infantry, and the award flags fluttering in the wind in the队伍marked their outstanding achievements. Chairman Mao's jeep approached the flag of the "Tower Mountain Hero Regiment," and Chief of Staff Liu Yalou, standing behind him, reported the heroic deeds of the hero regiment to the Chairman. Chairman Mao raised his hand in salute, looking extremely pleased. From Jinggangshan onwards, Chairman Mao painstakingly cultivated the Chinese Workers' and Peasants' Red Army. This people's army fought the people's enemies for more than 20 years, becoming tempered in a hundred battles and invincible under heaven.

　　After the parade, Chairman Mao and his entourage and the democratic figures got out of the cars, and a warm and united scene immediately appeared at the airport. Everyone faced the sun and took a photo with Chairman Mao as the center. This was a great unity of China's democratic forces. All the forces in China that opposed American imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism surged towards the liberated areas, converging on an unprecedented scale.

　　“毛主席万岁”！
　  欢迎毛主席朱总司令特写
    一九四九年三月二十五日，中国人民领袖毛主席到了北平。北平人民对于毛主席的到来，感到无上的光荣和骄傲，在平党政军民各界代表及一百六十多位民主人士，齐赴西郊机场欢迎。
    五时正，毛主席、朱总司令、刘少奇、周恩来、任弼时、林伯渠诸同志……进入西郊机场。林彪将军、聂荣臻将军、贺龙将军立刻趋前迎接，军乐大作，上万的人群齐声欢呼：“毛主席万岁”、“朱总司令万岁”……欢迎行列的最先端是工人代表，不少久经革命斗争的老工人，胡子已经斑白了。毛主席和他们一一握手，许多人双手握着毛主席的手，紧紧不放。工人阶级和自己的领袖会合一起，那是一幅多么热烈的、动人的场面！
    毛主席和朱总司令一行走到妇女代表的行列面前。华北妇女代表李秀镇和毛主席握手有半分钟之久。她在共产党、毛主席的领导下翻了身，她在长期革命斗争中成为拥军与生产的模范。她曾多次冒着生命的危险，以高度机警的动作，给人民解放军传送情报，并将自己的独生子献给了革命。当她在全国妇女第一届代表大会上讲述她过去的英雄事迹时，她坚决地表示她将和所有劳动妇女一起在毛主席领导下干到底。现在她亲眼看到了毛主席，她苍老的脸都因兴奋而涨红了。
    毛主席一行和民主人士一一握手言欢。李济深、沈钧儒、黄炎培、郭沫若……都会见了。大家互相问候，互祝健康。许多先生笑着、说着，好久合不拢嘴。
    一发照明弹升上天空，阅兵式正式开始。毛主席登上第一辆淡绿色的吉普车，朱总司令、刘少奇同志……也依次登车，缓缓行经漫长的解放军的行列。五十门六○炮陆续发出五百发照明弹，半边天空布满亮晶晶的星球。观众一齐鼓掌，欢声震天。这里是成排的坦克车，车上飘着红旗。坦克手穿着整齐的军服，一齐向自己的领袖敬礼。毛主席、朱总司令含笑还礼，表露出无限的欢欣。这里是成排的高射炮、榴弹炮和重炮，许多立过特殊功勋的炮身上，插着各色各样的奖旗、这里是机械化部队，一色的汽车、一色的装备，战士们具一色的雄伟英姿。他们从东北打到华北，不久还要打到华南，人民依靠他们，得到了今天这种光荣的胜利。这里是无敌的步兵，队伍中迎风招展的奖旗，标志着他们特出的功绩。毛主席的吉普车进到“塔山英雄团”的大旗之前，站在他身后的刘亚楼参谋长向主席报告英雄团的英雄事迹。毛主席举手还礼，状极愉快。从井岗山起，毛主席艰辛的培植中国工农红军，这支人民军队和人民的敌人打了二十多年，百炼成钢，已经无敌于天下了。
    阅兵完毕，毛主席一行和民主人士都下了汽车，机场上立刻出现了一个亲热、团结的场面。大家面向着太阳，以毛主席为中心，拍了一张照片。这是中国民主力量的大团结，全中国反对美帝国主义、反对封建主义、反对官僚资本主义的力量都涌向解放区，以空前的规模汇合起来了。
