　　Yangquan Fourth Mine
  　Adjusts Wages
    [This newspaper dispatch] The Yangquan Fourth Mine recently adjusted the wages of all mine staff and pit workers. Because the mine's wage system had egalitarian tendencies, for example, a skilled worker operating a high-powered vehicle earned a wage of five jin of rice per day, while a child greasing coal carts earned four to four and a half jin per day, a difference of only half a jin to one jin of rice. After the list of members of the Wage Adjustment Committee was announced, most employees believed that this wage adjustment would be a general increase in wages. The leadership then used study methods such as classes and discussions among the staff and workers to correct this erroneous understanding and make everyone understand the basic spirit of this wage adjustment. After more than ten days of study, everyone initially understood that the general spirit of this wage adjustment was to enable employees to truly earn the wages they deserve based on their responsibilities, abilities, skills, and work attitude, and to change the past unreasonable phenomenon of egalitarian wages. For example, pit affairs staff member Liu Fuzhang said: "This adjustment is not about increasing or decreasing, but about truly earning what you should based on your ability!" In terms of wage assessment methods, departments were used as units. When assessing a certain section, the head of that section was called in to report the specific work ability and work attitude of each person in the section. After comparing each person, the grade was determined, and then the wage standard was divided. In addition to the above achievements, the wage adjustment at the Fourth Mine still had shortcomings: for example, when assessing, each section chief was willing to increase the wages of more people in their own section, because they did not pay attention to breaking departmentalism. In addition, this wage adjustment was carried out hastily, and there was no good understanding of each worker and staff member. It mostly relied on the reports of section chiefs and individual responsible persons. If the section chief or foreman did not have a sufficient understanding of the situation in their section or had personal feelings, it could also lead to individual unreasonable phenomena.

　　阳泉四矿
  　调整工资
    【本报讯】阳泉四矿近调整全矿职员和里工工人工资。因该矿工资存在平均主义现象，比如，一个开高车的熟练工人，每天是五斤米的工资，而运煤小车上梏油的小孩，一天的工资也是四斤到四斤半，只差半斤到一斤米。在调资委员会名单公布后，大多数职工认为这次调整工资是普遍增加工资。领导上就在职员、工人中分别用上课、讨论等学习方式，纠正对这种错误认识，使大家了解这次调整工资的基本精神。经过十多天的学习，大家初步的认识了这次调整工资的总精神是为了使职工真正能凭职责能力、技术和工作态度挣到自己应挣的工资，改变过去不合理的平均工资现象。比如坑务职员刘福章说：“这次调整不在增了减了，是真能按你的能力该挣多少就挣多少！”在评定工资的方法上，是以部门为单位，评那个股调资委员会就把那个股股长找来，让股长先报告本股每个人的具体工作能力，工作态度，一个一个经过比较后，确定等级，再划分工资标准。四矿这次调整工资，除了以上的成绩外，仍有缺点：如评定时各股股长都愿意本股的人多增，因没注意打破本位思想。另外这次调整工资进行的仓促，没有很好的到工人、职员中去对每个人进行了解，大都凭股长及个别负责人的报告。股长、工长要对本股情况了解不够或有私人感情，也就可能造成个别不合理的现象。
