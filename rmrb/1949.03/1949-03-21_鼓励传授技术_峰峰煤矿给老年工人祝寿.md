Taihang Electric: The state-owned Fengfeng Coal Mining Company held a grand birthday celebration on February 16th for employees aged fifty and above. Thirty-seven veteran workers, including Li Chengjin, attended the event. Each unit joyfully sent off the birthday celebrants with drums and gongs, and workers from various mines enthusiastically attended. The venue was filled with birthday gifts from various factories and mines, and colorful and exquisite birthday plaques and flags were hung in the center of the venue. The general manager and deputy general manager gave long and passionate congratulatory speeches to the birthday celebrants, encouraging them to "remain vigorous in old age... and contribute to the people." At the meeting, Manager Song said in his congratulatory speech: "The history of the veteran employees is inseparable from the history of the coal mine. They have contributed to the people, so we must celebrate the birthdays of these elders. The enemy and puppet rulers and the capitalists of the old society would kick old workers aside, but we respect our old workers." He hoped that the birthday celebrants would tirelessly teach and train apprentices well, passing on their skills completely to their apprentices. They should conduct more research with the young people, improve their skills, and make progress together, not thinking that they are too old and useless. They should have the spirit of "refusing to accept old age" and manage their mine well. Finally, the birthday celebrants spoke with great excitement. Fang Xiangting, an old worker from the First Plant, said: "Such generous gifts and so many people celebrating our birthdays, I am almost overjoyed! This is only possible when we workers become masters of society under the leadership of our proletarian party—the Communist Party. In the old society, we workers lived lives worse than cattle and horses. Let alone celebrating birthdays, they would kick you out before you even got old. Today's factory is our workers' factory, and we must work harder for our own factory in the future."

    峰峰煤矿给老年工人祝寿
    【太行电】国营峰峰煤业公司，于二月十六日给五十岁以上的老年职工举行隆重的祝寿大会。到会寿翁有李成金等三十七名。赴会时，各单位都是锣鼓喧天地欢送，各矿到会工人非常踊跃。会场摆满了各厂矿送来的寿礼，会场当中悬挂着各色精致的寿匾、寿旗。正副经理给寿翁以长篇热情的祝词，勉励他们“老当益壮………为民立功”。会上，宋经理致贺词说：“老年职工们和煤矿的历史是分不开的。他们对人民有功，所以要给这些老者祝寿。敌伪统治者和旧社会的资本家对年老的工人是一脚赐开，我们对老工人则是尊重的。”他希望寿翁们教人不倦，好好带徒弟，把自己的技术完全传授给徒弟，要和青年们多研究，提高技术，共同进步，不要认为年纪大了，不中用了，要有“老不服老”的精神，把自己的矿办好。最后寿翁们都以极兴奋的情绪讲了话。一厂老工人房相亭说：“这么大的厚礼，这么多的人给我们做寿，真快要高兴死了！这只有在我们无产阶级的政党——共产党领导下，我们工人成了社会的主人翁的时候，才有这样的日子。旧社会里我们工人过着不如牛马的生活，不要说做寿了，不等老了就一脚把你踢出去了。今天的工厂，就是我们工人的工厂，我们以后要加倍努力，为自己的工厂而工作。”
