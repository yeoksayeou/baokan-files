Several Problems That Must Be Solved for Mentougou to Further Increase Production

Mentougou has been liberated for three months. The three state-owned coal mines have achieved results in the three months since they were taken over. That is, the original enterprise structure has not been disrupted, and the output has been increased. However, to further develop production, some problems must be solved. First, the factors hindering production development must be eliminated.

　　　　The first obstacle is the failure to adjust personnel in a timely manner.

During the Kuomintang bandit gang's rule, the three mines buried a group of capable talents. For example, in the Chengzikuang mine's electromechanical group, excellent welders were sent to the iron furnace to hammer, and skilled mechanics were sent to carry stones, watch pumps, and carry coal. On the other hand, some people with poor skills were used as clerks and technicians. As a result, the electric winch was broken in January, and it took 38 days to repair, with five days of work stoppage. The workers are very dissatisfied with this. Therefore, everyone urgently demands that adjustments be made as soon as possible. An employee of the Xishan mine said at a discussion: "Clarify the situation as soon as possible, and it will be a pleasure to work wholeheartedly..." At the same time, the large organization and the large number of non-production personnel have increased costs. For example, in Mentougou Mine, the coal production efficiency per worker in February was 1.04 tons, while the average for all mine workers was 0.21 tons. In Xishan Mine, the coal production per worker in February was 0.78 tons, while the average for all mine workers was 0.36 tons. In Chengzikuang Mine, the coal production per worker in February was 1.5 tons, while the average for all mine workers was 0.18 tons (Chengzikuang is a new mine, with more workers in construction). Therefore, in order to increase work efficiency and reduce costs, it is necessary to equip a lean personnel organization and transfer non-production personnel to direct production.

　　　　The second is that the wage issue must be resolved reasonably.

For example, Ma Zifeng, a mechanic at the Chengzikuang mine, said: "I have been driving locomotives in railway mines for more than 20 years. When I came to this mine as a temporary worker to drive a winch, I earned six catties of millet a day, while apprentice workers earned six catties and four taels of rice a day." A temporary worker in Mentougou said at a discussion: "We cannot compare with those with skills; but with the same effort, the inside workers earn half as much salary as the temporary workers. The Kuomintang did this unreasonably and it should be abolished..." After the Kuomintang bandit gang occupied the mines, they brought in many incompetent "door-knocking goods" (referring to relatives and friends of Kuomintang "plunder and search" personnel), laid off capable people, changed them to temporary workers, and paid them less. Some "door-knocking goods" who could not do anything were given a temporary worker title and ate a free meal. Employees of Xishan Mine reflected: "After liberation, some temporary workers did the work of clerks, but they were still paid as temporary workers." Now, the workers are looking forward to solving this problem quickly. At the discussion, everyone suggested: "After liberation, people should be employed according to their talents, and wages should be determined according to their abilities. Discrimination against temporary workers should be abolished as soon as possible...."

　　　　The third is that although the contractor system has been announced to be abolished in Mentougou Mine, it still needs to be thoroughly resolved.

As a result of the mine trade union's publicity, exposure, and supervision of the darkness of the contractor system to the workers, the contractors dare not deduct workers' wages and suppress wage payments as before. However, these contractors generally adopt a passive attitude, and some contractor heads deliberately load large stones into the bottom of the tank on the night shift and cover them with a layer of coal dust. Some contractors are secretly wooing workers, provoking discord, and hindering workers from forming their own brother teams (small contractors). Therefore, mobilizing the employees of Mentougou Mine, especially the pieceworkers (coal miners), to awaken and thoroughly solve the problem of the contractor system is also a prerequisite for further carrying out the production campaign.

　　　　The fourth obstacle is that some workers still have sectarian disunity.

In the past, in order to divide the workers for easy rule, the Kuomintang bandit gang inserted some pawns among the workers, bought off some employees, and carried out provocations. They created the Northeast faction, the Jingxing faction, the Nangong faction, and the Renxian faction among the employees, causing them to suppress each other. They applied small favors to a small number of employees, and implemented oppression and discrimination against pieceworkers and temporary workers. The Kuomintang's pseudo-trade unions also separately organized pseudo-"pieceworker trade unions" and "inside worker trade unions," specializing in provoking worker opposition. The enemy's result of this divisive rule caused disunity between employees and workers, inside workers and outside workers (pieceworkers), and this faction and that faction. This phenomenon has not been completely overcome, and large and small disputes continue to occur in various mines. These problems should all be resolved by strengthening education.

### 门头沟进一步增产中必须解决的几个问题

　　门头沟进一步增产中必须解决的几个问题
    门头沟解放已三个月，三个国营煤矿在接管的三个月中，是获得了成绩的。这就是没有打乱原来的企业机构，并且提高了产量，但为进一步发展生产，有些问题必须解决，首先必须消除障碍生产发展的因素。
    　　　　第一个障碍，就是人事没有及时调整
    三矿在国民党匪帮统治时期都埋没着一部分精明强干的人材。如城子矿机电组叫优秀的电焊工去铁炉打锤，叫熟练的机匠去抬石头、看泵、背煤；另一方面却用着一些技术不好的人充当职员技工，因此在一月间把电绞车开坏，结果修理了三十八天，停工五天。工友们对这些很不满意。因之，大家迫切要求早日予以调整。西山矿职员在座谈会上说：“赶紧弄清，该干什么一心踏地的干下去也痛快了……”同时因为机构的庞大，非生产人员很多，就增加了成本，如门头沟矿二月份采煤工每工产煤效率为一·○四吨，全矿职工平均则为○·二一吨，西山矿二月份采煤工每工产煤为○·七八吨，全矿职工平均则为○·三六吨，城子矿二月份采煤工每工产煤为一·五吨，全矿职工平均则为○·一八吨（城子是新矿，建工程用工多些），因此为了增加工作效率，减低成本，必须配备精干的人事机构，将非生产人员转入直接生产。
    　　　　第二就是工资问题须合理解决
    如城子矿机工马子峰说：“我在铁路矿山，开机车二十余年，到这矿上当临时工开绞车，一天挣六斤小米，学徒工人一天倒挣六斤四两米。”门头沟一临时工工友在座谈会上说：“有技术的咱不能跟人家比；但一样的出力气，里工比临时工多挣一半薪金，国民党弄得这事真不合理，该取消…”国民党匪帮占领后，带来许多无能的“门子货”（即国民党“劫搜”人员的亲友），裁下能干的人，改为临时工，少给工资，而“门子货”有的不会干事，就挂个临时工名，白吃一份。西山矿职员反映：“解放后有的临时工做了职员的事情，还是按临时工给工资”。现在工友们总盼着快解决这个问题。座谈会上大家提意见说：“解放了要量材用人，按能力定工资，赶快取消对临时工的歧视…。”
    　　　　第三是包工柜在门头沟矿虽已宣布取消但尚待彻底解决
    矿工会把包工柜的黑暗向工人宣传揭露及监督的结果，使包工柜不敢象从前那样克扣工人工资，压支工资了，但这些掌柜的们一般采取消极应付的态度，甚至有的柜头，在夜班故意往罐底装大石头，顶上盖层煤末，有的包工柜正在暗中拉拢工人，挑拨离间阻碍工人自己成立兄弟班（小包工）。因此在门头沟矿发动职工，尤其件工（采煤工）觉悟起来，彻底解决包工柜的问题，也是进一步开展生产运动的前提。
    　　　　第四个障碍是某些工人还存在着宗派不团结
    过去国民党匪帮为了分裂工人，便于统治，就在工人中打入一些爪牙，收买一些职工，进行挑拨离间，在职工中制造了东北派，井陉派，南宫派，任县派等使之互相倾压，对一小部分职工施用小恩小惠，对件工临时工则施行压迫歧视，国民党的伪工会又分头组织伪“件工工会”“里工工会”，专门挑拨工人对立，敌人这种分化统治的结果就造成了职员与工人，里工与外工（件工），此派与彼派的不团结，这种现象尚未完全克服，大小纠纷各矿都不断发生。这些问题，都应从加强教育中予以解决。
