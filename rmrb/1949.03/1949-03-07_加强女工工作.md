　　Strengthening Women Workers' Work
    This year, when the Party organizations and people's groups in various liberated areas commemorate "March 8th" International Working Women's Day, in addition to continuing to focus on rural women in the countryside, they should also pay attention to the propaganda for women workers in places with women workers, and examine their own women workers' work, and formulate concrete and feasible measures to strengthen this work.
    With the victorious development of the people's liberation cause, we have liberated many cities and industrial areas, and will liberate more cities and industrial areas in the future. In these places, the working class is the force we must first rely on. Among Chinese workers, especially light industrial workers, women workers account for a large number, sometimes even exceeding the number of male workers. Therefore, strengthening women workers' work and improving their awareness and organization is of great significance in the current people's liberation cause.
    Women workers in the liberated areas, like male workers, are already in a leading position politically and socially. In state-owned enterprises, they are part of the masters of the enterprise. The primary task of women workers in state-owned enterprises is to strive to restore and develop industrial production, increase the necessities for the army and the people, and ensure the rapid victory of the people's liberation struggle. Only in this way can the lives of women workers be gradually improved. Therefore, women workers should adopt a new labor attitude, strive to learn production technology, improve production efficiency, and achieve high output, good quality, and low cost to complete and exceed the state's production plans. Women workers in private enterprises in the liberated areas should also adhere to the principle of giving consideration to both public and private interests and benefiting both labor and capital. On the one hand, they should strive to develop production, and on the other hand, protect their own interests and realize their rights. Women workers in both state-owned and private enterprises should actively participate in various political, social, and cultural activities, unite and lead rural working women and women of other democratic strata to jointly participate in the great cause of building a New Democratic country.
    In order to achieve these goals, Party organizations and women's groups in various places must carry out the following tasks:
    First, strengthen the education of women workers, and use methods such as convening meetings, running night schools and short-term training courses, and publishing wall newspapers and publications to improve their political awareness and cultural level, so that they can establish new labor concepts and acquire new knowledge, and play a leading role as an advanced class in various constructions.
    Second, guarantee the employment of women workers and gradually improve their lives, implement equal pay for equal work, run women workers' welfare undertakings, solve the special difficulties of women workers, and give special care to pregnant women and mothers.
    Third, organize women workers to participate in trade unions, and let the trade unions lead the education and welfare undertakings of women workers, and pay attention to strengthening the unity between male and female workers. When necessary, set up a women workers' department in the trade union, or convene a women workers' representative meeting by the trade union to solve special problems related to women workers.
    When carrying out the above tasks, cadres engaged in women's work must strive to overcome the tendency of insufficient understanding of the leading role of the working class in the revolution, as well as the shortcomings such as the style of being incompatible with the working masses caused by being in the countryside for a long time. With the spirit of learning from rural women and serving rural women in the past, they should go deep into factories, learn from women workers, and serve women workers.

### 加强女工工作

　　加强女工工作
    今年解放区各地党的组织和人民团体在纪念“三八”国际劳动妇女节的时候，除了在农村中仍然以农村妇女为目标进行宣传工作外，凡是在有女工群众的地方，都应该注意对女工的宣传，并且要检讨自己的女工工作，定出加强这个工作的切实可行的具体办法。
    随着人民解放事业的胜利发展，我们已经解放了很多的城市和工业区，将来还要解放更多的城市和工业区。在这些地方，工人阶级是我们首先要依靠的力量。在中国的工人中特别是轻工业工人中，女工占很大的数量，有时还超过男工。所以加强女工工作，提高女工的觉悟性和组织性，在当前的人民解放事业中有着极重大的意义。
    解放区的女工，和男工一样，在政治上和社会上已经处在领导者的地位。在国营企业中，她们是企业的主人翁的一部分。国营企业女工的当前首要任务，就是努力恢复和发展工业生产，增加军队和人民的必需品，以保障人民解放斗争的迅速胜利。只有这样，女工的生活才能逐步地改善。因此，女工应当以新的劳动态度，努力学习生产技术，提高生产效率，做到产量多、质量好、成本低，以完成并超过国家的生产计划。解放区私营企业中的女工，也应当按照公私兼顾与劳资两利的原则，一方面，努力发展生产，另一方面，保障自己的切身利益和实现自己的权利。无论国营的或私营的企业中的女工，都应当积极参加政治的、社会的、文化的各种活动，团结并领导农村劳动妇女以及其他民主阶层妇女，共同参加建设新民主主义国家的伟大事业。
    为了达到这些目的，各地党的组织和妇女团体必须进行下列工作：
    第一、加强对女工的教育，用召集会议，举办夜校和短期训练班，出版壁报、刊物等等方法，提高她们的政治觉悟和文化水平，使她们建立新的劳动观点和获得新的知识，在各种建设中发挥自己作为一个先进阶级的领导作用。
    第二、保障女工的职业并逐步改善她们的生活，实行同工同酬，举办女工福利事业，解决女工的特殊困难，特别照顾孕妇和产妇。
    第三、组织女工参加职工会，由职工会领导对女工的教育和女工福利事业，并注意加强男女工人间的团结。必要时在职工会中设立女工部，或由职工会召开女工代表会议，解决与女工有关的特殊问题。
    在进行上述各项工作的时候，从事妇女工作的干部，必须努力克服对于工人阶级在革命中的领导作用认识不足的倾向，以及由于长期处于农村所造成的与工人群众格格不入的作风等缺点，以过去向农妇学习、为农妇服务的精神，深入工厂，向女工学习、为女工服务。
