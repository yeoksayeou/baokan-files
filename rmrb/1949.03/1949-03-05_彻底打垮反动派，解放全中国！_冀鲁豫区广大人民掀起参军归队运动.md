　　【Jilu-Yu Dispatch, 1st】To strengthen the People's Liberation Army, thoroughly defeat the reactionary Kuomintang ruling apparatus, and liberate all of China, the people in the vast areas of the Jilu-Yu region, except for a few newly liberated areas, have universally launched a movement to enlist and return to the ranks since February 15th. In deployments throughout the area, special emphasis was placed on: acting on the basis of conscious voluntarism, calculating according to labor power, and achieving rationality. This ensures, on the one hand, that the People's Liberation Army can become even stronger, and on the other hand, that production is not unduly hindered – a correct policy. In implementing this work, various localities first clarified the situation to cadres and the masses, carried out education on carrying the revolution through to the end, and exposed the enemy's false peace conspiracies. At the same time, they combined this with concrete facts of how the Chiang bandit troops had raped, burned, killed, and looted in the past, as well as individual experiences of liberation, to conduct repeated education and discussions. On the basis of this further enhancement of mass consciousness, the work of enlisting and returning to the ranks was launched. For example, in Chengwu County, Third Sub-district, when everyone at the village cadre meeting recalled the blood feuds of parents and wives being brutally murdered, it ignited the flames of enlisting and returning to the ranks to eliminate the deadly enemies and avenge the wrongs. In the Sixth Sub-district, on the third day after this task was conveyed to the villages, more than twenty people had already voluntarily enlisted and returned to the ranks. In the Fourth Sub-district of Juye County, Sixth Sub-district, Kong Fanqing's grandmother, who was over seventy years old, was overjoyed when she heard that her grandson had signed up and told Kong Fanqing, "We suffered so much poverty in the past. The Communist Party came and we were allocated a few acres of land. You must do your best for the country." The bad element Kong Qingcai spoke ill to Grandma Kong, trying to shake her determination, but she immediately rejected him and reported it to the enlistment committee. At a village cadre meeting in Shou'zhang County, Ninth Sub-district, Hebei, at the beginning of the study, some village cadres had a "take a break" mentality. After conducting in-depth education on carrying the revolution through to the end, and further analyzing the class essence of the reactionaries headed by Chiang Kai-shek from the facts of the enemy's persecution of the people in our region, everyone immediately changed their thinking. Comrade Wang Qing, a village cadre, said at the meeting: "Chiang Kai-shek's peace is false. During the War of Resistance Against Japan, he did not actively resist Japan, but launched the Southern Anhui Incident to eliminate the New Fourth Army headquarters. After the victory of the War of Resistance Against Japan, he came to attack the people and the Communist Party, support the landlords, and kill the poor. Thinking back to the past, I begged for food outside for seven and a half years, and when I came home, I had nothing. The landlord said to my face: 'A dog has to eat shit even if it's driven to the edge of the sky, and a wolf has to eat meat even if it walks to the edge of the sky.' Now we have turned ourselves around. To live a good life forever, we can only eliminate the reactionaries and carry the revolution through to the end." After deliberation, everyone's emotions were very high. Village cadre Ma Jixian immediately checked his mistake of covering up his brother's failure to return to the ranks and guaranteed to mobilize him to return to the front line. In Hubu Ji Village, Shanghe County, Communist Party member Shi Yinsheng took the lead in enlisting and said that he would never return until the Kuomintang reactionaries were completely eliminated. After this work was deployed, veteran support and enlistment mobilization committees were generally established in the villages to specifically discuss veteran support and enlistment work. In Nanwang County, Seventh Sub-district, in order to facilitate the care and management of the lives and education of new and returning soldiers, new soldier reception centers and returning soldier reception centers were established separately.

　　彻底打垮反动派，解放全中国！
    冀鲁豫区广大人民掀起参军归队运动
    【冀鲁豫一日电】为壮大人民解放军，彻底打垮国民党反动统治机构，解放全中国，冀鲁豫广大地区的人民，除少数新解放地区外，其余各县于二月十五号以后，已普遍的掀起参军归队运动。在各地布置中，都特别强调提出：在自觉自愿的基础上作到根据劳力计算，作到合理。一方面保证使人民解放军能够更加强大，另方面又不致使生产受过大妨碍的正确政策。各地在贯彻这一工作中，首先在干部和群众中讲明形势，贯彻将革命进行到底的教育，揭露敌人假和平阴谋，同时结合当地过去受蒋匪军奸淫烧杀，抢劫等具体事实，个人翻身情况，进行反复教育与讨论酝酿，在这样的群众觉悟进一步提高的基础上，掀起了参军归队工作，如三分区城武县各区，在村干会上当大家回忆起被残杀父母妻子血海深仇时，激起了参军归队消灭死敌大报仇冤的火焰。六区将这一任务传达到村的第三天，自动参军归队者即达二十余人。六分区巨野县四区，孔繁庆七十多岁的老祖母，听说孙子报了名，喜欢的了不得，并告诉孔繁庆：“过去咱受穷多难，共产党来了咱才分了几亩地，你一定好好的为国家出力”。坏分子孔庆才向孔老太太说坏话，企图动摇她的决心，当即为她拒绝，并报告给参军委员会。河北九分区寿张县的村干会上，在开始研究时，村干中有种“歇歇”思想，经过深入的进行将革命进行到底的教育外，又从敌人对我区人民的迫害事实中，进一步分析了蒋介石为首的反动派的阶级本质，大家即从思想上转变过来。村干王庆同志在大会上说：“蒋介石的和平是假的，在抗日时期不积极抗战，发动皖南事变消灭新四军军部，抗日胜利后又来打人民和共产党，给地主撑腰杀害穷人；想想过去，我在外边要了七年半饭，回家来没东西，地主当面对我说：‘狗赶到天边也得吃屎，狼走到天边也得吃肉’。现在咱们翻身了，要永远过好日子，只有把反动派消灭光，将革命干到底。”经过酝酿后，大家情绪很高，村干马继贤当场检查自己掩护兄弟不归队的错误，并保证动员其重回前线。尚和县户部寄村，共产党员施银生带头参军并表示不彻底消灭国民党反动派决不回来。各地经过这一工作布置后，在村中普遍成立优军与动员参军委员会，具体讨论参军优军工作。七分区南旺县为了便于照顾管理新战士与归队战士生活与教育等问题，又分别成立了新战士招待所与归队战士收容所。
