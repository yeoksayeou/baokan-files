Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 4th: On February 24th, the Northeast Daily, the organ of the Northeast Central Bureau of the Chinese Communist Party, published a letter of suggestions to the Railway Department from Chen Lin, Jiang Juchen, and six others from the Economic Department of the Northeast Administrative Committee in a prominent position as the headline story on the front page, along with self-criticisms from the Railway Department and the Northeast Daily. In their letter of suggestions, Chen Lin and the others objectively assessed the significant achievements of the Northeast Railway work over the past two years, and frankly criticized some shortcomings in the railway work based on their personal experiences, such as: (1) Scheduled passenger trains are frequently delayed. (2) The implementation of the responsibility transport system is not responsible enough. Some organizations have lost entire vehicles of goods entrusted for shipment, or goods are unloaded midway, making it impossible for the owners to find them; more commonly, goods are delayed for a long time before arriving, causing significant time and material losses to the owners. (3) Special trains do not run according to schedule, trains leaving the station are not inspected, and inspectors are not responsible; the express train from Harbin to Shenyang, originally scheduled to arrive in 36 hours, once took 71 hours. All of the above are inconsistent with the recently promoted responsibility system and the regulations for improving operational efficiency. Chen Lin and the others also believed that the Northeast Daily had reported very little on the shortcomings of railway work in the past and should conduct more self-criticism and report more on areas that should be improved. Therefore, they suggested that comrades responsible for railway work should publish some self-critical articles in the Northeast Daily. After receiving the letter, the Railway Department instructed relevant departments and railway bureaus to conduct thorough inspections and propose countermeasures. Yu Guangsheng, Deputy Minister of the Railway Department, also conducted a preliminary self-criticism regarding the shortcomings raised by Chen Lin and the others. The department decided to continue to collect opinions from all parties and then formulate specific plans for improving work and solving problems to be announced in the Northeast Daily, and conduct a more profound self-criticism. While publishing the suggestions of Chen Lin and the others and the Railway Department's response, the Northeast Daily published its own self-criticism, pointing out: In the past, the newspaper's style of only reflecting achievements and not reflecting, or rarely reflecting, shortcomings and errors – a "reporting good news, not bad" style – was not based on seeking truth from facts in terms of ideology and did not reflect the full and true situation. This would weaken the educational significance of the news, paralyze our own ranks, making them unable to be vigilant and improve their work, and also unable to motivate everyone to move forward. The newspaper has already conducted a preliminary self-criticism of this serious shortcoming, but it is still far from enough, especially since it has not been completely corrected in practice. How to both commend the achievements made in reporting various tasks and appropriately criticize the existing shortcomings to strengthen the guiding role of the Party newspaper and promote work in all aspects is what the newspaper should strive to do most in the future. The newspaper also called on responsible persons of leading organs at all levels in the Northeast to lead by example, humbly listen to the opinions of the masses, further develop criticism and self-criticism, and continuously improve various construction works.

　　东北铁道部听取群众意见
  　检查改进铁道工作
    东北日报检讨“报喜不报忧”作风
    【新华社沈阳四日电】二月二十四日，中共东北中央局机关报东北日报，以头版头题的显著地位，刊载了东北行政委员会经济部陈林、姜君辰等八人对铁道部的建议及铁道部与东北日报的自我检讨。陈林等八人在建议信中，除客观地估计了两年多来东北铁路工作的巨大成绩外，并根据亲身经历，率直地批评了铁路工作中的若干缺点，如：（一）定点旅客旅车经常误点。（二）实现责任运输制不够负责，有些机关托运物品整车丢失，或中途卸车使货主无法寻找；较普遍的则是物品延期甚久方始到达，使货主在时间上物质上受很大损失。（三）专车不按定点开行，列车出站不检查，检查员不负责任；由哈尔滨至沈阳之上急列车原定三十六小时到达，某次竟开行七十一小时。以上均与最近提倡的负责制及提高运转率的规定不合。陈林等八人并认为东北日报过去对铁路工作的缺点报道甚少，应多进行一些自我批评，多报道一些应行改进的方面。因此他们建议负责铁道工作的同志应有一些自我批评的文章在东北日报上发表。铁道部于接获该信后，仍指定各有关部门及各铁路局深入进行检查，提出对策。铁道部副部长余光生并对陈林等八人所提缺点进行了初步的自我检讨。该部决定继续搜集各方意见，然后作出具体改进工作和解决问题的方案在东北日报上公布，并进行更深刻的自我批评。东北日报在刊登陈林等八人的建议及铁道部的答复同时，公布了自己的检讨，指出：过去报纸只反映成绩不反映或很少反映缺点错误的“报喜不报忧”作风，在思想方法上不是实事求是的，不是反映全面真实情况的；这会减弱新闻的教育意义，麻痹自己的队伍，使其不能警惕与改进自己的工作，也不能激励大家前进。这个严重缺点，报社虽已有过初步检讨，但是还很不够，特别是还没有在实践中完全改正过来。今后如何在报道各种工作时，既能表扬其所得的成绩，又能恰当地批评其所存的缺点，以加强党报的指导作用，推动各方面的工作，是报纸今后所最应努力做到的。该报并要求东北各级领导机关负责人员以身作则，虚心听取群众意见，更进一步开展批评与自我批评，不断改进各项建设工作。
