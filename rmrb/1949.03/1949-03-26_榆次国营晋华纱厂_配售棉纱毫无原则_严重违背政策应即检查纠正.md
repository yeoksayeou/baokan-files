　　Yuci State-owned Jinhua Yarn Factory
  　Cotton Yarn Allocation Lacks Principles
    Seriously Violates Policy, Should Be Inspected and Corrected Immediately
    [Taiyuan Telegraph] The state-owned Yuci Jinhua Yarn Factory lacks principles in its allocation of cotton yarn, violating policy, allowing the private capitalist Zhao Jialong to seize opportunities for speculation, hoarding, and manipulation. According to a survey in October of last year, the cotton weaving industry in Yuci City had increased from one factory before liberation to eight, with a total of 29 cotton weaving machines; in November, it increased to 18 factories, with a total of 60 cotton weaving machines. However, when the Jinhua Yarn Factory produced its first batch of yarn in October of last year, due to a lack of investigation and research, and a lack of understanding of the situation, it mistakenly believed that "all industries were stagnant and yarn sales were difficult." It specifically entrusted Zhao Jialong, the manager of the privately owned Xiecheng Cotton Weaving Factory, as an agent, giving him 400 bundles of 16-count yarn (9 *shi jin* per bundle), calculated at a 5% or 2% discount on the wholesale price, and allowing deferred payment. On November 15 of last year, the factory began implementing a yarn allocation system for private cotton weaving factories, with most factories receiving only 80% of the cotton yarn they needed, while Xiecheng Cotton Weaving Factory accounted for two-tenths of the total allocated yarn. According to the lowest estimate, Zhao stole 450 bundles of cotton yarn through fraudulent means during the 73-day allocation period. At that time, the Jinzhong textile industry was recovering and developing, and cotton yarn was urgently needed. Taking Pingyao as an example, it needed 300 bundles of cotton yarn every day, but the Jinhua Yarn Factory could only supply slightly more than one-sixth of its needs. When the Yuci County-affiliated factory was established in November, it faced great difficulties in starting operations, and its request for assistance from Jinhua was rejected. Therefore, cotton weaving producers had to buy from the private capitalist Zhao Jialong at a price 20% higher than the allocated price. Zhao Jialong profited 200 yuan (Renminbi) per bundle of yarn, totaling 90,000 yuan in profit. The private Xiecheng Cotton Weaving Factory not only received extra allocations from the Jinhua Yarn Factory but also obtained a loan of 300,000 yuan from the Yuci branch of the People's Bank of China, using public funds for further hoarding. The Jinhua Yarn Factory and the Yuci branch of the People's Bank of China's loss of principle, lack of principle, and irresponsible work attitude should be inspected and corrected quickly.

　　榆次国营晋华纱厂
  　配售棉纱毫无原则
    严重违背政策应即检查纠正
    【太原电】国营榆次晋华纱厂配售棉纱缺乏原则，违背政策，致使私人资本家赵嘉隆得以伺隙投机囤积操纵。按去年十月份调查，榆次市的棉织业已由解放前的一家增至八家，共有棉织机二十九台；十一月份增至十八家，共有棉织机六十台。但晋华纱厂于去年十月出第一批纱时，由于不调查研究，不了解情况，却误认为当时“百业停顿，纱路不畅”，特委托私营协成棉织厂经理赵嘉隆代销，共给他十六支纱四百捆（每捆九市斤），并且按批发价格九五折或九八折计算，又允许缓期付款。去年十一月十五日该厂开始对各私营棉织厂实行配纱制，一般工厂只能得到需要棉纱的八成，而协成棉织厂却占全部配纱数十分之二。据最低估计，在七十三天的配售中，赵某以欺骗手段窃去棉纱四百五十捆。而当时晋中纺织业正在恢复发展中，急需棉纱，以平遥为例，每日就需棉纱三百捆，而晋华纱厂只能供给其需要的六分之一强。榆次干属工厂于十一月建立时，开工十分困难，请求晋华扶助却遭到拒绝。故棉织业生产者就不得不以高于配售价百分之二十的价格向私人资本家赵嘉隆去买，每捆纱赵嘉隆从中取利以二百元（人民币下同）计算，共可获利九万元。私营协成棉织厂不仅由晋华纱厂得到额外配售，且从中国人民银行榆次支行贷款三十万元，利用公款进行进一步的囤积。晋华纱厂以及中国人民银行榆次支行此种丧失立场，毫无原则，不负责任的工作态度，应迅速检查纠正。
