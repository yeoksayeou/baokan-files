　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 18th. According to a dispatch from Diantong News Agency, Copenhagen, 13th: The summoning of three Icelandic ministers to Washington demonstrates the intensity of the pressure exerted on Iceland. Iceland is a small country, formerly a territory of Denmark, and only recently gained its freedom. Copenhagen has learned that the Icelandic government will first be pressured to accept American protection and to join the North Atlantic Pact. Once Iceland agrees to join this pact, the United States or Britain will immediately demand to station troops in Iceland. If Iceland becomes an "ally" of Denmark, Denmark will also share the "right" to militarily occupy Iceland. Freedom-loving Icelanders are greatly resentful of the prospect of their country being re-occupied by American, British, and Danish troops. These Icelanders are proud of their long struggle to break away from the Kingdom of Denmark and achieve independence. Icelanders will consider such an occupation an unbearable humiliation. An Icelandic government that accepts foreign occupation will be overthrown for selling out Iceland's independence.
    Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 17th. Various reports: Disregarding the opposition of their people, the foreign ministers of Denmark and Iceland have successively flown to Washington to negotiate with the United States government on the issue of joining the North Atlantic Pact. Danish Foreign Minister Rasmussen arrived in the United States on March 10th and held successive talks with US Secretary of State Acheson, State Department Counselor Bohlen, and Assistant Secretary of State Gross, who is in charge of the so-called "military foreign aid plan," from the 11th to the 14th. Icelandic Foreign Minister Benediktsson arrived in the United States on the 13th, and talks with Acheson and others began on the 14th.

　　美帝强拉冰岛参加反动集团
    【新华社陕北十八日电】据电通社哥本哈根十三日讯：冰岛三个部长的被召赴华盛顿，显示了加诸冰岛压力的强度。冰岛是一个小国，原为丹麦属地，只是在最近方得到自由。哥本哈根方面获悉，冰岛政府将首先受到迫使它接受美国保护的压力，要它参加北大西洋公约。一旦冰岛同意参加这个公约，美国或英国就将随即要求在冰岛驻扎军队。如果冰岛成为丹麦的“盟国”，丹麦也将分享对冰岛军事占领的“权利”。爱自由的冰岛人，对于国土重被美英丹军队占领的远景大感愤恨，这些冰岛人对他们争取脱离丹麦王国而独立的长期斗争是引为骄傲的。冰岛人将认为这种占领是不可忍受的屈辱。接受外国占领的冰岛政府，将因出卖冰岛的独立而被打倒。
    【新华社陕北十七日电】各方报导：不愿本国人民的反对、丹麦与冰岛两国外长，已先后飞抵华盛顿与美国政府谈判参加北大西洋公约的问题。丹麦外长拉斯穆荪于三月十日抵美，十一日至十四日连续与美国务卿艾奇逊，国务院参议包伦及国务院专司所谓“军事援外计划”之助理国务卿葛罗斯等会谈。冰岛外长宾尼狄克已于十三日抵美，与艾奇逊等之会谈于十四日开始。
