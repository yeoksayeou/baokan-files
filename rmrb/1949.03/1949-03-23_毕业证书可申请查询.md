　　Diploma can be applied for inquiry
    Mr. Diao Mingzhang:
    Before the liberation of Beiping, in order to avoid military service, you handed over your diploma to the pseudo-municipal government's civil affairs bureau. Now the pseudo-municipal government has long been taken over by the military control commission. You can apply to your district people's government to write a letter of certification, introducing you to the Beiping Municipal People's Government Civil Affairs Bureau for inquiry and retrieval.

　　毕业证书可申请查询刁明章君：
    北平解放前，你为躲避兵役，曾将毕业证书交与伪市府民政局，现在伪市府早已为军管会接收，可申请你区人民政府写信证明，介绍你到北平市人民政府民政局查询索取。
