Xinhua News Agency Editor's Note: This article is translated from the 1932 edition of the Soviet Small Encyclopedia and comprises items under the title "Soviet Cooperatives." The article concisely describes the tasks, organizational situation, and working conditions of various cooperative movements in the Soviet Union between 1924 and 1929. The enormous role of the Soviet cooperative economy in the national economy, the broadness and closeness of various cooperatives' connection with the masses, and their organizational orderliness and successful experiences in work are largely worthy of emulation by various cooperatives in today's New Democratic China. Therefore, we specially publish it, hoping that the staff of local people's governments and Communist Party and mass organizations, especially those engaged in economic work and cooperative work, will pay attention to it. The various forms of cooperatives mentioned in this article, except for collective farms in agricultural cooperatives, which do not yet have the conditions in today's China and cannot be organized, and housing construction and leasing cooperatives, which are difficult to develop universally, most of the other types of cooperatives can be universally organized and developed. For example, consumer cooperatives can be organized among all consuming people, worker consumer cooperatives can be organized among employees of factories, schools, and institutions, and transportation worker consumer cooperatives can be organized among transportation workers such as railways and sailors. Among farmers, various agricultural supply and marketing, credit, and production cooperatives can be organized. Among independent small handicraft workers and family handicraft laborers, handicraft supply and marketing, credit, and production cooperatives can be organized. In addition to their grassroots organizations, these cooperatives should each have their district, county, city, provincial, and even national organizational systems, as well as various cooperative federation organizations at all levels. Because the organization of various cooperatives is very complex, involving a very large and numerous population, this organizational system, that is, organizational orderliness, is very necessary; otherwise, it will fall into chaos and fail to serve the people well. The Soviet cooperatives' experience in this regard is particularly worthy of our emulation. Although the cooperatives in our liberated areas have developed somewhat in recent years, and some have been able to serve their members well or relatively well, they have not been able to develop greatly, and many have failed or gone bankrupt. The main reason is the lack of this organizational orderliness, the absence of higher-level cooperative organs, resulting in unclear tasks, unclear division of labor, poor management, or failure to wholeheartedly serve the members, but rather aiming at doing business with non-members, speculating and making profits for dividends, and allowing the existence of the exploitation system within the cooperative. To correct these shortcomings and errors in the cooperative movement, to systematically, correctly, gradually, and universally develop cooperatives on a large scale, and to enable cooperatives to play a huge role in the future New Democratic national economy, it is very important to learn from the successful experience of Soviet cooperatives. This is the purpose of publishing this article. This article is a material on the early Soviet cooperative movement. As for the achievements that the Soviet cooperative movement has reached today, the two news items on the 50th anniversary of the Soviet consumer cooperative movement published by TASS last November can give a general idea and are also attached. Also, the original statistical charts in this article have been changed to text descriptions due to inconvenience for broadcasting.

　　　　I. Soviet Credit Cooperatives

    The task of Soviet credit cooperatives is to concentrate funds through shares, deposits, and loans (mainly from the state) to lend to (for production purposes) poor and middle peasant households and their collective organizations. Credit cooperatives also conduct business as brokers in buying and selling goods. Credit cooperatives were merged with consumer cooperatives according to the decree promulgated on January 27, 1920, and were restored by the decree of January 24, 1922. Currently, credit cooperatives belong to the agricultural credit system, which consists of the Cooperative Agricultural Credit Association, the Agricultural Credit Company, agricultural banks in various republics, and the All-Union Central Agricultural Bank. Credit cooperatives belong to the general system of agricultural cooperatives. The Agricultural Credit Association is affiliated with the Federation of Credit Cooperatives. The Agricultural Credit Association is an organization that connects farmers with the domestic financial market and is the main distribution line through which state funds are issued to improve the peasant economy. If the operating policy of the credit cooperative is appropriate, it can play a huge role in improving agriculture and the socialist transformation of rural areas. The basic points of this operating policy are as follows: (1) mainly support the collective farm movement, (2) improve the poor peasant economy, (3) assist the development of the middle peasant economy, (4) maximize the mobilization of local funds (shares, deposits).

    The development of the agricultural credit association network and its business is as follows (October 1):

    The development of agricultural credit associations, their number: 6,700 in 1924, 10,400 in 1929 (estimated); the number of individual members: 1,442,800 in 1924, 8,750,000 in 1929 (estimated).

    The organization and activities of the cooperatives are basically stipulated in the law "On Cooperative Credit" of January 18, 1927.

　　　　II. Soviet Consumer Cooperatives

    The task of Soviet consumer cooperatives is to organize the supply of personal consumer goods and household goods to the laboring residents, and this is carried out on the basis of the laboring residents raising and participating in the raising of operating funds and working capital. The business activities of consumer cooperatives are manifested in: (1) selling consumer goods produced by state large-scale industries to direct consumers, (2) purchasing and selling agricultural and handicraft products to consumers, (3) producing various commodities in their own enterprises, mainly nutritional products, (4) organizing enterprises that serve the consumption process itself and collectivize household affairs (restaurants, laundries, etc.), (5) conducting import and export transactions of consumer goods and related export transactions. Consumer cooperatives obtain state industrial products in a planned manner based on general contracts and orders with trusts and syndicates. Agricultural and handicraft goods are partly purchased directly from scattered commodity producers and partly obtained from agricultural cooperatives and handicraft cooperatives according to contracts. Import and export transactions are carried out through relevant state organs, and consumer cooperatives always strive to maximize the connection of these transactions with cooperative systems abroad. The business activities of consumer cooperatives are supplemented by many cultural and educational measures, such as promoting books, opening cinemas, radio broadcasting, conducting cooperative education, assisting various cultural and educational organs, etc.

    The current consumer cooperative is a large and complex but highly centralized organizational system, which is composed of the following basic links: (1) grassroots cooperatives directly uniting consumers - urban and rural consumer companies, central worker cooperatives, transportation industry consumer companies, (2) district-level federations of various grassroots cooperatives, (3) state federations, (4) central federations of various member republics (six), (5) All-Union Central Federation. Currently, state federations exist only in the Russian Federation, and not even in all regions.

    The development of Soviet consumer cooperatives, their number: 25,600 in 1925, 28,000 in 1928; the number of stores belonging to them: 51,400 in 1925, 85,000 in 1928; the number of shareholders: 9,436,000 in 1925, 25,581,000 in 1928.

    Since the October Revolution, consumer cooperatives have made great achievements. It has become the most extensive organization of the laboring residents and the basic commodity sales organ in the country. The following data can further prove the increase in the proportion of consumer cooperatives in domestic trade turnover:

    The percentage of consumer cooperatives in trade, in wholesale trade, from 1923 to 1924, accounted for 15%, and from 1927 to 1928, accounted for 33.2%; in retail trade, the former accounted for 22%, and the latter accounted for 53.5%; in the sale of state products, from 1924 to 1925 accounted for 31.5%, and from 1927 to 1928 accounted for 46%. (⑴⑶)

　　　　(III) Soviet Workers' Cooperatives

    The Soviet Workers' Cooperative is a member of the general system of consumer cooperatives, and it is only a special branch of consumer cooperatives. Since the October Revolution, the issue of complete separation of workers' cooperatives has been raised more than once. The separation issue has always been rejected because of the need to maintain the leading role of the proletariat in the cooperative movement, consolidate its influence on peasants, and develop the economic strength of the cooperative itself as much as possible. Although workers' cooperatives belong to the general system, they enjoy a certain degree of autonomy and have their own organ representatives to protect their special interests. Workers' cooperatives have their own branches (worker branches and central worker cooperative branches), conferences, and leading organs (presidium of the central worker cooperative branch) in the All-Union Central Federation, in the cooperative centers of various member republics, and in a series of state workers' cooperative federations. These leading organs are elected by the congress of plenipotentiary representatives elected from the candidates proposed by the workers' cooperative conference. The consumer cooperatives of transportation workers and staff are a special branch of workers' cooperatives. The representatives of this type of consumer cooperative are some large-scale transportation industry consumer companies and their federated organizations belonging to the central federation system - transportation industry branches. The following figures illustrate the strong development of worker cooperatives and transportation cooperatives and the significant increase in their role in serving worker residents:

    The development of workers' cooperatives is divided into worker cooperatives and transportation cooperatives. The number of worker cooperatives was 1,500 in 1925 and 1,400 in 1928; the number of shareholders was 3,754,000 and 7,720,000 respectively. The number of transportation cooperatives was 39 in 1925 and 44 in 1928; the number of shareholders was 641,000 and 1,160,000 respectively.

    In 1928, the shareholders of worker cooperatives accounted for more than 60% of all workers who should be in trade union organizations, and possessed approximately 52% of the part of the worker budget that could generally purchase goods through cooperatives.

　　　　(IV) Soviet Agricultural Cooperatives

    The task of Soviet agricultural cooperatives is to achieve the socialist transformation of agriculture through the collectivization of farmers. Since 1921, agricultural cooperatives have developed rapidly, and by 1928, they had several million cooperatives, uniting nearly 15 million farmers. The gold turnover of agricultural cooperatives in 1927-28 was 466.1 million rubles. The work of Soviet agricultural cooperatives is aimed at economically isolating and eliminating the capitalist components of rural areas, and at uniting the poor and middle peasant classes in rural areas on the basis of farmer collectivization. The activities of agricultural cooperatives extend to the following areas: (1) processing and selling agricultural products; (2) supplying farmers with means of production (machines, farm tools, seeds, livestock, fertilizers, etc.); (3) issuing production loans; (4) carrying out poultry and livestock breeding work; (5) directly carrying out agricultural production collectivization. Agricultural cooperatives can be divided into the following basic categories: (1) agricultural credit cooperatives and supply and marketing department stores, (2) specialized production and marketing cooperatives (oil-making, tobacco, potato, etc.), (3) extremely simple production joint organizations (soil improvement, machinery, seed improvement, livestock breed improvement), (4) collective farms.

    The development of Soviet agricultural cooperatives, their number: 35,600 in 1925, 120,000 in 1928; the number of member households joining agricultural cooperatives: 5,361,000 and 15 million respectively.

    In the economic life of the Soviet Union, agricultural cooperatives occupy an important position. They already account for nearly 40% of the grain commodity turnover, three-quarters of the industrial agricultural product turnover, and more than one-third of the livestock product turnover. Organizing the market and mastering commodity turnover makes it possible to systematically control the spontaneous process of the market through agricultural cooperatives. Ordering farmers' produce has great significance in the work of agricultural cooperatives.

    The organizational structure of agricultural cooperatives is very complex. There are 65 types of such cooperatives. These cooperatives are united into district federations, which are united into state federations, and finally into republic federations. Each member republic has a general federation of agricultural cooperative federations as a joint center. As for the All-Union organ, the All-Union Agricultural Cooperative Council performs its duties.

    In recent years, the specialization of agricultural cooperatives has been rapidly progressing. Department store comrades and federations have spun off various specialized comrades (dairy products, potatoes, tobacco, etc.), and their rapid development is completely comparable to that of department store comrades. By 1928, the Russian Federation had established sixteen central federations: the All-Russian Dairy Cooperative Federation, the Flax Cooperative Federation, the Grain Cooperative Federation, and others. From 1928, production collectivization became the center of attention. Through supplying machinery, ordering farmers' produce, organizing tractor teams and tractor stations, agricultural cooperatives united huge peasant masses in extremely simple joint organizations and collective farms, gradually solving the task of organizing large-scale mechanized collective farms.

　　　　(V) Soviet Handicraft Cooperatives

    Soviet handicraft cooperatives unite handicraft workers with the aim of jointly handling the purchase of raw materials, the sale of finished products, the issuance of credit, and the organization of collective production enterprises. Grassroots handicraft cooperatives take various forms: supply and marketing comrades, production groups, or credit handicraft comrades with buying and selling broker transactions. The Soviet handicraft cooperative system consists of cooperative centers in various republics, local federations, and grassroots comrades; in addition, there is the All-Union Handicraft Cooperative Council as a planning and leading center, whose responsibility is to guide handicraft cooperatives towards the path of planning and assist in the collectivization of handicrafts. The entire Soviet handicraft cooperative mostly belongs to the system of the All-Russian Cooperative Industry Federation. This federation, in addition to uniting the handicraft cooperatives of the Russian Federation, also unites the handicraft cooperatives of Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, and Armenia. Ukraine, Belarus, Georgia, and Azerbaijan each have their own handicraft centers. A considerable number of handicraft cooperatives do not belong to any system and are in a "wild" state, many of which are typical rural cooperatives.

    Although handicraft cooperatives have great difficulties in development, they have shown considerable growth. Below are the statistics for the Russian Federation as of October 1 (not including "wild" groups):

    The number of lower-level handicraft cooperatives was 7,402 in 1927 and 12,985 in 1929; the number of members was 500,9787 and 1,013,253 respectively.

    Handicraft cooperatives unite 17% of the handicraft workers and artisans, and should possess 21% by the end of 1929. The percentage of cooperation is not large because handicraft workers are extremely scattered, they use the materials of the orderers to make finished products, it is quite difficult to obey the cooperative movement, and also because handicraft workers are enslaved by private intermediary capital. Nearly half of the lower-level cooperatives have common workshops, with approximately 62,000 members. The total commodity turnover of the entire Soviet handicraft cooperative system was 125.42 million rubles in 1926-27, 225.83 million rubles in 1927-28, and 429.19 million rubles in 1928-29. The total gold commodity turnover of the entire All-Russian Cooperative Industry Federation system was 79.66 million rubles in 1926-27, 134.88 million rubles in 1927-28, and 220.39 million rubles in 1928-29. Handicraft cooperatives receive great help from the state through credit, planned supply of raw materials and semi-finished products, exporting finished products abroad, and obtaining leases of many state enterprises under interest-free conditions. Handicraft cooperatives have great significance in improving the labor productivity of small industry, in planning small industry to adapt to the overall process of national economic development, in liberating small industry from the enslavement of intermediary capital, and in gradually evolving it to a large-scale socialized industrial form. The People's Committee's decision on "Handicraft Industry" on May 3, 1927, is a necessary and basic measure for the development of handicrafts. (To be continued)

专栏：

　　苏联合作社
    新华社编者按：本文译自苏联小百科全书一九三二年版，系该书“苏联合作社”题目下的各条。文中简明地叙述了苏联一九二四年至一九二九年间各种合作社运动的任务及其组织情况与工作情况。苏联合作社经济在国民经济中所起的巨大作用，各种合作社联系人民群众的广大性与密切性及其组织上的条理性与工作中的成功的经验，绝大部分都足为今天新民主主义中国的各种合作社所取法，故特加以发表，望各地人民政府及共产党与群众团体的工作人员，特别是从事经济工作与合作社工作的人员予以注意。本文所述各种形式的合作社，除农业合作社中的集体农场在今天中国的条件还不具备，还不能组织，住宅修建与租赁合作社还很难普遍发展外，其余各种合作社，大都是可以普遍组织和发展的。例如：在一切消费的人民中可以组织消费合作社，在工厂、学校和机关的职工中可以组织工人消费合作社，在铁路、海员等运输工人中可以组织运输工人消费合作社。在农民中可以组织各种农业供销、信贷及生产的合作社，在独立的小手工业者及家庭手工业劳动者中可以组织手工业供销、信贷及生产的合作社等。这些合作社除它们的基层组织外，应各有其区的、县的、市的、省的以至全国的组织系统，并有各种合作社的各级联合会组织。因为各种合作社的组织十分复杂，包括的人民群众十分广大众多，这种组织上的系统，即组织上的条理性，是十分必要的，否则，就要陷入纷繁混乱，不能很好地为人民服务。而苏联合作社在这方面的经验，是特别值得我们取法的。我们解放区的合作社，近年来虽也有些发展，也有些能够很好地或比较好地为社员服务，但是还不能很大地发展，并有很多是失败或破产了的。究其主要原因，就是缺少这种组织上的条理性，没有合作社的高级机关，因而任务不明，分工不明，经营不善，或者不去全心全意为社员服务，而以向非社员作生意、投机取巧赚钱分红为目的，在合作社内部容许剥削制度的存在等。而要改正合作社运动中的这些缺点与错误，在广大范围内系统地、正确地、逐步地、普遍地发展合作社，并使合作社在今后新民主主义的国民经济中发生巨大作用，学习苏联合作社的成功的经验，乃是十分要紧的事情。这就是本社发表此文的目的。此文是苏联早期合作社运动的材料，至于苏联合作社运动今天所已达到的成绩，则塔斯社去年十一月发表的关于苏联消费合作社运动五十周年纪念的两则消息可明大略，也附志于此。又本文中原附统计图表，因不便广播，已改为文字说明。
　　　　　　　　
    　　　　一、苏联信贷合作社
    苏联信贷合作社底任务是用股金、存款及借款（主要取自国家）的方式集中资金，用以贷给（为了生产的目的）贫农中农户及其集体组织。信贷合作社同时并进行买卖货物的经纪人事务。信贷合作社按一九二○年一月二十七日颁布之法令曾与消费合作社合并，而一九二二年一月二十四日的法令又把恢复起来。现在，信贷合作社属于农业信贷系统，这一系统系由合作农业信贷同志社、农业信贷会社、各共和国农业银行以及全苏中央农业银行所组成。信贷合作社属于农业合作社总系统之内。农业信贷同志社联合为信贷合作社联合会。农业信贷同志社是使农户与国内金融市场相联系的机关并且是主要的分配线，而国家资金即经过这分配线放发出去，以提高农民经济。如果信贷合作社底经营政策方向是适当的，它便能在提高农业与社会主义式地改造农村的事业中起极大的作用。这种经营政策底基本点如下：（一）主要支持集体农庄运动，（二）提高贫农经济，（三）协助中农经济底发展，（四）最大限度地动员地方资金（股金、存款）。
    农业信贷同志社网及其业务之发展如下（十月一日）：
    农业信贷同志社的发展情形，其社数，一九二四年为六千七百社，一九二九年为一万零四百社（估计）；个人社员数目，一九二四年为一百四十四万二千八百人，一九二九年为八百七十五万人（估计）。
    合作社底组织和活动在一九二七年一月十八日“关于合作社信贷”的法律中基本上给规定了。
    　　　　二、苏联消费合作社
    苏联消费合作社底任务是组织以个人消费品和家庭用品供给劳动者居民，而这是在劳动者居民自行筹集与参加筹集经营基金和流动资金之基础上进行的。消费合作社底事务活动表现于：（一）推售国家大工业所生产的消费商品给直接的消费者，（二）购置和推售农业与手工业生产品给消费者，（三）在自己企业内生产各种商品，主要是营养品之类的商品，（四）组织服务于消费过程本身的及使家庭事务集体化的企业（饭厅、洗衣厂等等），（五）进行消费性商品底输入事务及与之有关的输出事务。消费合作社是在与托拉斯和辛迪加的总合同及订购的基础上有计划地取得国家工业生产品的。农业和手工业商品，一部分直接从零散的商品生产者那里购得，一部分是按照合同从农业合作社和手工业合作社那里取得。输出输入的事务是经过有关的国家机关来进行的，而消费合作社总是力求最大限度使这些事务与国外的合作社系统取得联系。消费合作社底经营事务活动尚有许多文化教育性质的措施给以补充，类如推销书籍，开放电影，无线电广播，进行合作社教育，协助各种文化教育机关等等。
    现时的消费合作社是一个大而复杂但又十分集中的组织系统，它由下列基本环节所组成：（一）直接联合消费者的基层合作社——城市和乡村的消费会社、中心工人合作社、运输业消费会社，（二）各基层合作社底区级联合会，（三）州联合会，（四）各加盟共和国中央联合会（六个），（五）全苏中央联合会。现时只在俄罗斯联邦才有州联合会，并且也不是全境都有州联合会。
    苏联消费合作社发展的情形，其社数，一九二五年为二万五千六百社，一九二八年为二万八千社；其所属售货店数目，一九二五年为五万一千四百处，一九二八年为八万五千处；股东数目，一九二五年为九百四十三万六千人，一九二八年为二千五百五十八万一千人。
    十月革命以来，消费合作社有了巨大的成绩，它变成了最广大的劳动者居民群众底组织以及国内基本的商品推销机关，下述材料更能证明消费合作社在国内贸易周转中比重之增高：
    消费合作社在贸易中的百分比，在批发商业中，一九二三至二四年，占一五％，一九二七至二八年，占三三·二％；在零售商业中前者占二二％，后者占五三·五％；在国家出品的销售中，一九二四至二五年占三一·五％，一九二七至二八年占四六％。（⑴⑶）
    　　　　（三）苏联工人合作社
    苏联工人合作社是消费合作社总系统中的一员，它只是消费合作社的一个特别支脉。自十月革命以来，曾不只一次地提出关于工人合作社完全分立的问题，一直因为要保持无产阶级在合作社运动中的领导作用，巩固它对农民的影响，以及为了尽可能地大力发展合作社本身底经济力量，分立的问题始终遭受了否决。工人合作社虽然属于总的系统中，但它享有一定程度的自治权，并有自己的机关代表及保护它的特殊利益。工人合作社在苏联中央联合会中，在各加盟共和国合作社中心及在一系列州的工人合作社联合会中有自己的支部（工人支部及工人合作社中心支部）、会议，以及领导机关（工人合作社中心支部主席团）。这些领导机关是由工人合作社会议提出的候选人中产生的全权代表全体大会上选出的。运输业工人和职员底消费合作社，是工人合作社底一个特别支脉，这种消费合作社底代表是一些大规模的运输业消费会社以及它们的属于中央联合会系统的联合组织——运输业支部。下列数字即说明工人合作社和运输业合作社底强大发展及其在为工人居民服务事业中的作用之重大增长
    工人合作社的发展情形，分工人合作社与运输业合作社两种。工人合作社的社数，一九二五年为一千五百社，一九二八年为一千四百社，股东数目，前者为三百七十五万四千人，后者为七百七十二万人。运输业合作社的社数，一九二五年为三十九社，一九二八年为四十四社；股东数目，前者为六十四万一千人，后者为一百一十六万人。
    一九二八年，工人合作社拥有的股东为一切应于职工组织的工人百分之六十强，并拥有一般可经过合作社购置货物的那一部分工人预算底百分之五十二左右。
    　　　　（四）苏联农业合作社
    苏联农业合作社底任务是经过农户集体化方式达到农业底社会主义改造。从一九二一年起，农业合作社猛烈地发展着，到一九二八年，它已拥有几百万个合作社、联合了将近一千五百万农户。农业合作社底金周转额在一九二七—二八年为四十六万六千一百万卢布。苏联农业合作社底工作是力求在经济上孤立和排除农村的资本主义成份，力求在农户集体化的基础上联合农村的贫农中农阶层。农业合作社底活动推广到下列范围：（一）农产品之加工和出卖；（二）供给农民以生产资料（机器、农具、种籽、牲畜、肥料及其他）；（三）发放生产贷款；（四）进行饲养禽畜的工作；（五）直接进行农业生产集体化。农业合作社可分成下列各种基本的类别：（一）农业信贷合作社与供销百货合作社，（二）专门产销合作社（制油的、烟草的、马铃薯的等等），（三）极简单的生产联合组织（改良土壤的、机器的、改良种籽的，改良牲畜品种的），（四）集体农庄。
    苏联农业合作社发展的情形，其社数一九二五年为三万五千六百社，一九二八年为十二万社；加入农业合作社的社员户，前者为五百三十六万一千户，后者为一千五百万户。
    在苏联底经济生活中，农业合作社占着重大的地位。它已经有将近百分之四十的粮食商品周转额，四分之三的工业用农产品周转额以及三分之一强的牲畜产品周转额，组织市场及掌握商品周转，使得有可能经过农业合作社有计划地支配市场底自发过程。订购农民生产品在农业合作社工作中具有极大的意义。
    农业合作社底组织结构是非常复杂的。有六十五种这样的合作社。这些合作社联合成区联合会，后者联合成州联合会，最后则联合成共和国联合会。每个加盟共和国有一个农业合作社联合会的联合总会作为联合中心。至于全苏的机关则有全苏农业合作社理事会执行职务。
    最近几年，农业合作社底专业化正迅速进行着。百货同志社和联合会分派出各种专业同志社（乳制品的、马铃薯的、烟草的等等），它们飞快的发展完全可与百货同志社相比。到一九二八年，俄罗斯联邦建立了十六个中心联合会：全俄制乳合作社联合会，亚麻合作社联合会，谷物合作社联合会及其他。从一九二八年起，生产集体化成了注意底中心点。经过供给机器，订购农民生产品，组织拖拉机队及拖拉机站，农业合作社把巨大农民群众联合在极简单的联合组织和集体农庄中，逐渐地解决组织大规模机械化集体农庄的任务。
    　　　　（五）苏联手工业合作社
    苏联手工业合作社，是把手工业者联合起来，目的是在共同办理购买原料，出售制成品，发放信贷及组织集体生产企业等等事宜。基层手工业合作社有各种形式：供销同志社，生产组合、或是带有买卖经纪人事务的信贷手工业同志社。苏联手工业合作社系统系由各共和国的合作社中心，各地方的联合会及基层同志社所组成；除此以外，尚设有全苏手工业合作社理事会作为计划及领导的中心，其职责为引导手工业合作社走向计划的轨道，及协助手工业底集体化。整个苏联手工业合作社，大部是属于全俄合作工业联合会底系统，这联合会除联合俄罗斯联邦手工业合作社外，尚联合土尔克门、乌兹贝克及阿美尼亚底手工业合作社。乌克兰、白俄罗斯、俄鲁齐亚及阿塞拜然则各有自己的手工业中心。有相当数目的手工业合作社不属于任何系统，处于“野生”的状况，有不少是典型的农村合作社。
    手工业合作社虽然在发展上有很大的困难，但已表现相了当大的增长。下面是十罗斯联邦十月一日的统计（“野生”的组合不计在内）：
    手工业的低级合作社社数，一九二七年为七千四百零二社，一九二九年为一万二千九百八十五社；社员数前者为五十万零九千七百八十七人，后者为一百零一万三千二百五十三人。
    手工业合作社联合了百分之十七的手工业者和手艺业者，到一九二九年末则应拥有百分之二十一。合作底百分比之所以不大，是因为手工业者极端分散，他们用订购者底材料制作成品，颇难服从合作运动，也因为手工业者被私人居间资本所奴役的原故。将近一半的低级合作社有共同的作坊，拥有大约六万二千社员。苏联手工业合作社整个系统底商品周转总额，在一九二六——二七年为十二万五千四百二十万卢布，在一九二七——二八年为二十二万五千八百三俄万卢布，在一九二八——二九年为四十二万九千一百九十万卢布。全俄合作工业联合会整个系统底金商品周转额在一九二六——二七年为七万九千六百六十万卢布，在一九二七——二八年为十三万四千八百八十万卢布，在一九二八——二九年为二十二万零三百九十万卢布。手工业合作社，经过信贷，有计划地供给原料及半制品，把制成品输出国外、在免息条件下取得许多国家企业的租借——经过这种路线从国家方面得到很大的帮助。手工业合作社在提高小工业底劳动生产率的事业中，在适应国家经济发展总进程的小工业计划化事业中，在使小工业从居间资本的奴役中解放出来及使其逐渐进化到大规模社会化工业形式的事业中，有着巨大的意义。一九二七年五月三日人民委员会“关于手工业”的决定是手工业发展底必要的基本办法。（待续）
