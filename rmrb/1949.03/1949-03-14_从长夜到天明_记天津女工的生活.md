　　From Long Night to Dawn
    ——A Record of the Lives of Tianjin Female Workers
    Before liberation, Tianjin's female workers suffered cruel exploitation and inhuman humiliation. In the Kuomintang bureaucratic enterprises, they worked very long hours every day, but their earnings were not enough to make a living. Wei Yulan entered the China Textile Company at the age of twelve. Due to twelve hours of work every day, her legs have become bent. The female workers of Hengyuan Yarn Factory worked from 9:00 pm every night until 7:00 am the next morning. Many people suffered from chronic diseases due to staying up late, lack of sleep, and malnutrition. Wang Xue, a female worker in a weaving factory, was so exhausted that she vomited blood. Pregnant female workers of the No. 2 Factory of China Textile Company often could not get rest before giving birth, because the factory did not allow leave. In November of the previous year, the pregnant woman Tian Gui did not get a ride home in a rickshaw until she was about to give birth, and blood flowed all over the rickshaw, almost giving birth to the child in the rickshaw. Many female workers dared not marry for fear of losing their jobs and family burdens.
    In addition to suffering economic exploitation and oppression, they were often bullied by factory police, foremen, and puppet union directors. The female workers of the Tianjin Bedding and Furnishings Factory were often insulted by Liu Faming and Shen Haiting, the leaders of the iron buckle team. Whoever resisted could not go to work. Xie Yuzhen, a female worker in the Dongya Tobacco Factory, was forced to leave the factory and died miserably due to poverty and illness because she could not bear the insults of the puppet union directors. Shu Yuan, a female worker in the No. 6 Factory of China Textile Company, was often scolded by the foreman for being "rustic," so she had to tighten her mother's and her own belts, save money to buy new clothes, leather shoes, and perms to make the foreman happy.
    However, after a long night, dawn finally arrived.
    On January 15, the People's Liberation Army entered Tianjin. The Military Control Commission took over the Kuomintang bureaucratic enterprises, and they were liberated. The female workers of each factory immediately became active, participated in the celebration parade for the liberation of Pingjin; elected representatives to prepare for the "March 8th" Women's Day celebration; and organized study groups to conduct studies.
    On "March 8th" Women's Day, they held commemorative meetings respectively. The female workers of the Pingjin Clothing Factory went to the streets to put up slogans and make oral propaganda from the 6th.
    After becoming the masters of the factory, they increased production to support the People's Liberation Army and strive for national victory. Yang Guirong, a weaver in the No. 2 Factory of China Textile, ranked second in the factory in terms of weaving performance. Hu Yuzhen, of the packaging department of Dongya Tobacco Factory, could only pack 700 to 800 boxes of cigarettes a day in early February, but now she can pack up to 1700 to 1800 boxes at most. Shu Yuan, of the No. 6 Factory of China Textile, said: "Now the factory is our own, and we must cherish cotton, not waste it, and spin good yarn." They actively study in their spare time. The female workers of the Huidui No. 1 Factory of Tianjin Paper Company learn three characters every day, and they all make their own study plans and strive to improve their cultural and political level.

### 从长夜到天明——记天津女工的生活

　　从长夜到天明
    ——记天津女工的生活
    解放前的天津女工，受着残酷的剥削和非人的侮辱。在国民党官僚企业中，她们每天做很长时间的工，所得却不够糊口。卫玉兰十二岁就进入中国纺织公司作工。由于每天十二小时的劳动，她的两条腿已经变弯了。恒源纱厂的女工们，每天晚上九点钟上班，要到第二天上午七点钟才下班。许多人因熬夜，睡眠不足，营养不良而患了慢性病。织布厂女工王薛就累得吐了血。中国纺织公司二厂的怀孕女工，在临产前，往往得不到休息，因为厂方不准假。前年十一月孕妇田桂一直到临产时才得坐上三轮车回家，血淌了满车，几乎把孩子生在车上。许多女工都因怕失业和家庭负担而不敢结婚。
    除了遭受经济上的剥削、压榨之外，她们还常常受到厂警、工头、伪工会理事们的欺侮。天津被褥装具厂的女工，经常受铁扣组组长刘发明和沈海亭的侮辱。谁反抗，就不能上工。东亚烟草厂女工谢玉珍，就因为不能忍受伪工会理事们的侮辱，被迫离厂贫病交加而悲惨地死去。中国纺织公司第六厂女工淑媛因为“土里土气”常被工头责骂，结果她只得勒紧母亲和自己的裤带，省下钱买新衣服、皮鞋和烫卷发来让工头开心。
    但是，度过了漫漫长夜，黎明终于来到了。
    一月十五日，人民解放军开进了天津市。军事管制委员会接收了国民党官僚企业，她们得到解放了。各工厂的女工立刻活跃起来，参加了庆祝平津解放游行大会；选出了代表筹备“三八”节纪念会；又组织了学习小组，进行学习。
    “三八”节日，她们分别举行了纪念会。平津被服厂女工自六号起，就到街上贴标语，作口头宣传。
    在作了工厂的主人以后，她们纷纷以提高产量来支援人民解放军，争取全国胜利。中纺二厂织布厂杨桂荣织布的成绩已在全厂占了第二位。东亚烟草厂包装部胡玉珍，在二月初每天还只能包烟七八百盒，现在最多的时候能包到一千七八百盒。中纺六厂淑媛说：“现在工厂是我们自己的，以后要爱惜棉花，不浪费，并且多纺好纱。”她们利用工余积极地进行学习。天津纸业公司灰堆一厂女工，每天学识三个字，她们都订出自己的学习计划，努力地提高文化、政治水平。
