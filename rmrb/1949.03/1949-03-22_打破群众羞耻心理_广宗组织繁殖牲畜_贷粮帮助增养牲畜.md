　　Overcoming Mass Shame
    Guangzong Organizes Livestock Breeding
    Loans Grain to Help Increase Livestock Raising
    [Our Newspaper] Guangzong County, Hebei Province, has gained considerable experience in organizing livestock breeding. The county has 9,001 cattle, 1,212 donkeys, 135 mules, and 12 horses, including a total of 2,650 female animals and 11 breeding bulls. Currently, 356 cattle have been mated, and 208 have been confirmed pregnant. Some villages, such as Shibai Village in the Second District and Yangfan Village in the Third District, have achieved excellent results in organizing livestock breeding. Their main experiences are: 1. Clearing up the masses' thinking. For example, some people thought raising breeding livestock was shameful, making it impossible to find good matches for their children, and that breeding livestock was not useful and difficult to feed. In response, it is necessary to conduct education and explanation, pointing out that this is the influence of the old society because the old society restricted the development of productive forces and thus saw it as shameful. In the New Democratic society, it is not only not shameful but also glorious, because livestock breeding is the most important task in production. 2. First find activists and experienced individuals who are willing to raise breeding livestock and mobilize them to influence others. 3. Solve the difficulties of households raising breeding livestock. For example, if someone wants to raise breeding livestock but cannot afford to buy it, the government will temporarily lend them 500 jin of millet, etc. 4. Regularly hold meetings of breeding livestock households to exchange experiences, and reward those who achieve good results on the spot. 5. Publicize policies on livestock breeding incentive measures and educate the masses not to look down on households raising breeding livestock, which is how the above achievements were obtained.

　　打破群众羞耻心理
    广宗组织繁殖牲畜
    贷粮帮助增养牲畜
    【本报讯】河北广宗县组织繁殖牲畜，获得不少经验。该县有牛九千零一头，驴一千二百十二头，骡一百三十五头，马十二匹，其中母畜共二千六百五十头，种牛十一头，现已交配牛三百五十六头，确已怀孕者二百零八头。有的村，如二区史柏社、三区杨凡等村，组织繁殖牲畜工作，成绩很好，其主要经验：一、打通群众思想，如群众认为养种畜是羞耻，无法给孩子们做亲家，种畜不好使，不好喂。对此，须进行教育解释，说明这是旧社会影响，因为旧社会是束缚生产力的，因之以此为耻；在新民主主义社会中，不但不是羞耻，而且是光荣的，因为繁殖牲畜是生产中最重要的任务。二、先找喂种畜之积极分子及有经验者，动员他们影响旁人。三、解决喂种畜户之困难。如愿养种畜而买不起者，政府暂借给五百斤小米等。四、定期召开种畜户会议，交流经验，有成绩者，当场给予奖励。五、宣传政策繁殖牲畜奖励办法，及教育群众对喂种畜户不要小看等，始获得上面成绩。
