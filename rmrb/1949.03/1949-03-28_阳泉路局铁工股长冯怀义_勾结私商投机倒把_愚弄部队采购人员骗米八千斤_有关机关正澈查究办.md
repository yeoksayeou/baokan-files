　　[This article reports that] Feng Huaiyi, the chief of the Engineering Section of the Yangquan Railway Bureau, colluded with Ding Weishi, the manager of a private iron furnace, to deceive the procurement personnel of the First Corps of the Field Army, undertaking to produce 800 foreign shovels at a high price, engaging in speculation, exploiting workers, and illegally profiting from 8,000 jin of millet. Before the Lunar New Year, procurement personnel from the First Corps came to the Railway Bureau to order foreign shovels. Feng Huaiyi, the chief of the factory's engineering section, saw the military procurement personnel as outsiders and regarded this as an opportunity to make a fortune through speculation. He took the procurement officer to Ding Weishi's private iron furnace and secretly agreed with Ding to charge 40 jin of millet per shovel, citing high raw material costs and expensive wages. The procurement officer, believing that Feng Huaiyi was a public official, contracted the 800 foreign shovels to them at that price. They subcontracted 350 of these to the workers in Ding Weishi's own factory, paying them only 16.5 jin of rice per shovel. After deducting the raw material costs, they made a net profit of 12.5 jin of rice per shovel, totaling over 4,000 jin, which exceeded the legitimate profit that the factory owner should have earned from directly managing the contracted work. They then subcontracted the remaining foreign picks to Du Taiyuan of a certain iron factory for 35 jin of rice per shovel (200 shovels), to a certain village cooperative in Pingding for 30 jin of rice per shovel (100 shovels), and, through Feng Huaiyi, to the workers of the Railway Bureau's Engineering Section for 27 jin of rice per shovel (150 shovels). In this way, they made an empty-handed profit of more than 3,900 jin of millet! Feng Huaiyi even boasted to the workers, demanding that the workers give him a fake share, so he could get dividends like the workers who made the shovels. When the workers learned the truth and pointed out that the exploitation was too great, Feng even fabricated rumors to slander the trade union, saying, "The trade union contracted these shovels and made some money from it." After discovering the illegal activities of Feng Huaiyi and others, the Yangquan No. 1 District Committee of the Chinese Communist Party is cooperating with relevant authorities to thoroughly investigate and handle the case.

　　阳泉路局铁工股长冯怀义
  　勾结私商投机倒把  
    愚弄部队采购人员骗米八千斤 
    有关机关正澈查究办
    【本报讯】阳泉市铁路局铁工股长冯怀义，伙同私营铁炉经理丁维士，欺骗野战军一兵团采购人员，以高价承做洋锹八百把，进行倒把，剥削工人，非法渔利小米八千斤。旧历年前，一兵团采购人员到铁路局定制洋锹。该厂铁工股长冯怀义以部队采购人员外行，视为投机发财机会到来，乃将该采购员领到私营铁炉经理丁维士处，与丁暗中说妥，借口原料高，工资贵，每把要价四十斤小米。采购员以为冯怀义是公家人，于是将八百把洋锹按价包给他们。他们把其中三百五十把包给丁维士自己工厂的工人做，每把只给工人工资十六斤半米，每把除原料外，净赚十二斤半米，共赚了四千多斤，超过了厂主自己直接经营包活应赚的正当利润。他们又把其余的洋镐，按每把三十五斤米转包给某铁厂杜太元二百把，按每把三十斤米转包给平定某村联社一百把，并且通过冯怀义，按每把二十七斤米包给铁路局铁工股工人一百五十把。这样他俩又空手赚了三千九百多斤小米！冯怀义还向工人夸功，要工人给他顶了一个空股，同做洋镐的工人一样分红。当工人们了解了实情，向冯提出剥削太大时，冯竟造谣污蔑工会，说：“这洋镐是工会包的，工会从中赚了部份米。”中共阳泉一区区委会发现冯怀义等之非法活动后，正协同有关机关澈查究办。
