　　400,000 cc of Medicine Transported to Chahar;
　　Over a Thousand Head of Cattle Injected Daily
　　[Chahar News] Following the arrival of the Northeast Livestock Epidemic Prevention Team in Chahar, the North China Government and the Beiping Military Control Commission specially dispatched twelve doctors from the Military Horse Epidemic Prevention Institute to Chahar on the 14th of this month to assist in epidemic prevention work. Including those previously sent, there are now five brigades, a total of 146 people (excluding local cadres), who have successively rushed to the epidemic areas to carry out work.
　　The second epidemic prevention team, which was dispatched earlier, has completed preventive injections for 5,826 head of cattle in 181 villages in Chicheng County and serum treatment for 81 sick cattle. After the cattle plague was eradicated in the county, they transferred to Sihai on the 9th to work. The third team in Chongli has also completed more than 80% of its tasks and will soon go to the Baoyuan area to complete the "outer-edge encirclement" plan. Due to the active help from local areas, and the improved supply of transportation, medicines, and equipment, work efficiency has greatly improved: from injecting around a hundred heads per day, it has now increased to over a thousand heads per day. Currently, more than 8,000 healthy cattle in northern Chahar have received preventive injections, and more than 60 sick cattle have been saved. However, cattle plague is still spreading. Except for Huade County, the epidemic is very serious in all counties of northern Chahar, and more than 3,000 cattle have already died. Recently, the Northeast Epidemic Prevention Team brought a large quantity of medicines, 400,000 cc, and went deep into the most severely affected Duotou area for rescue. Now, a team from the Military Horse Epidemic Prevention Institute has also joined, with ample manpower, equipment, and medicines. It is estimated that the epidemic can be basically eradicated in one to one and a half months.

　　药品四十万西西运察
    每日注射耕牛千余头
    【察哈尔讯】继东北家畜防疫队来察之后，华北政府与北平市军管会，特派军马防疫所医师十二人，于本月十四日来察协助进行防疫工作。连同以前派出的现已有五个大队，共一百四十六人（地方干部未计在内），先后分赶疫区进行工作。
    前派出的防疫第二队，在赤城县已完成一百八十一个村，五千八百二十六头牛的预防注射和八十一头病牛的血清治疗，全县牛瘟扑灭后，于九日转四海工作。第三队在崇礼也完成十分之八以上的任务，不久就去宝源一带，完成“外缘全线包围”计划。因地方上积极帮助，交通工具、药品器材之补充改善，工作效率大为提高：由每天注射百头左右，现已增到每日千头以上。目前察北已有八千多头健牛实施了预防注射，并有六十余头病牛得救。但牛瘟仍在蔓延。察北除化德县外，各县均很严重，已死牛三千余头。最近东北防疫队带来四十万ＣＣ之大宗药品，深入到牛疫最严重的多偷一带抢救，现又加入军马防疫所一队，人力、器材、药品等都很充实。估计一个月到四十天即可基本上扑灭。
