(Jizhong Electric) Liang Wan County (newly established county) New District, in the Liberation of the Pingjin Campaign, combined with supporting the front line to carry out the work of searching and suppressing scattered bandits. As of the end of the old lunar year, a total of five machine guns, more than 240 long and short guns, and 28,000 rounds of ammunition were seized. Although this work has achieved certain results, due to the slackness and complacency of some cadres, the work was not thorough enough. In the propaganda of the lenient policy, the lenient side was emphasized; the propaganda of suppressing and punishing the reactionary elements with heinous crimes was not enough, and those who had guns but did not hand them over were not dealt with in time. After review, it was recognized the above-mentioned errors and shortcomings. After the old lunar year, the work has improved, and the following experiences have been gained: (1) Deeply implement the new district policy among county and district cadres, explaining that the work of searching and suppressing after liberation is the most important link in stabilizing social order and carrying out new district work, and it is necessary to work hard in a long-term and in-depth manner. If there is complacency, the work will be affected. (2) Propagandize policies to raise the awareness of the masses. During the old lunar year, the county launched a propaganda blitz week, generally convened mass meetings with residential areas as units, and specially ordered puppet personnel to participate, ordering them to stand aside and listen to the training, pointing out the crimes of the enemy and puppet personnel, and explaining that the Baojia system was the grass-roots organization of the Kuomintang reactionary rule. The Baojia was an accomplice of the enemy and should be subject to people's review; those who still carried out sabotage activities with guns should be resolutely suppressed; and reactionary elements who hid guns and did not hand them over should be punished. In this way, the enemy and puppet personnel were exposed and pressured in public, dispelling some concerns of the masses. After a mass meeting was held in one district, puppet personnel in Wu Village handed over one rifle and one pistol. (3) Those who do have guns should be monitored, or reliable people can be found to confront them. For example, Ge Yuliang, the puppet chief of the large township, had a gun. When the cadre asked him, he falsely said that Wei Mou had taken it away. Later, Wei Mou was chased down. When the two met, Ge Yuliang had nothing to say and handed over the gun. (4) Conduct in-depth investigations and make key breakthroughs, targeting the poorer among the puppet personnel, repeatedly explaining our policies, raising their awareness, and urging them to report themselves. Some people use a false positive and tentative attitude to support us, handing over a small part first and hiding the majority. Therefore, we must conduct in-depth investigations and raise our vigilance. For example, Li Shixian, the puppet chief of Taizi Village, in order to deceive us, falsely created a certificate of our government's collection of guns in Beiping. When asked, he took out the certificate and asked us to look at it, attempting to get away with it. After repeated investigations, his trick was seen through, and the gun was handed over. In short, the main thing is to combine reliance on the masses with investigation and research.

　　清算麻痹自满思想后
  　良宛继续搜剿散匪
    【冀中电】良宛县（新设县）新区，在解放平津战役中，结合支援前线开展了清剿散匪工作，截至旧历年止，计缴获机枪五挺、长短枪二百四十余枝、子弹两万八千发。这一工作虽收到一定成绩，但因某些干部的松懈麻痹，工作不深入，在宣传宽大政策中，强调了宽大的一面；对罪大恶极的反动分子，给予镇压惩处宣传的不够，有枪不交的也未及时处理。经过检讨后，认清了上述的错误和缺点，旧历年后，工作有改进，并取得了以下经验：（一）在县区干部中，深入贯彻新区政策，说明解放后的清剿工作，是稳定社会秩序开展新区工作最重要的一环，必须长期深入艰苦地工作，如有自满情绪，工作即受损失。（二）宣传政策提高群众觉悟，在过旧历年时全县开展了宣传突击周，普遍召开了以小区为单位的群众大会，并特令伪人员参加，令其站立一旁听训，指出敌伪人员的罪恶，说明保甲制是国民党反动统治的基层机构，保甲是敌人的帮凶，应受人民审查；对持枪仍做破坏活动的，要坚决镇压；对有枪隐藏不交的反动分子，应受惩处。这样当众给了敌伪人员以揭露与压力，解除了群众某些顾虑，一区在开过群众会后，吴村伪人员交出大枪一枝、手枪一枝。（三）对确有枪支需要给以监视，亦可找可靠群众来对质，如伪大乡长葛玉良有枪，干部问到他时，他假言魏某拿走了，后追到魏某身上，二人到面一说，葛玉良无言可辩，把枪交出来。（四）深入调查，重点突击，以伪人员中较贫苦的为突击对象，反复讲明我之政策，提高其觉悟，促其自报。有的以假积极试探性的态度来支应我们，先交出一小部分，隐藏大部，因此我们必须深入调查，提高警惕。如台子村伪大乡长李世贤为欺骗我们，在北平假造我政府收枪的证条，问他时，则拿出条来叫看，企图支应过去，经再三调查，识破其诡计，把枪交了出来。总之，主要是依靠群众和调查研究相结合。
