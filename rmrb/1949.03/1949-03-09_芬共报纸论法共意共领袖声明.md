　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, March 7th: TASS, Helsinki, March 4th: The Finnish Communist Party's organ "Kansan Sanoma" pointed out in an editorial entitled "Struggle for Peace": "Thorez and Togliatti have refuted the absurd rumors spread by the warmongers about the Soviet Union's attempt to invade, and have powerfully demonstrated that the socialist Soviet Union is leading the struggle for peace and has no intention of aggression against any country." The editorial pointed out: "It is very clear that the French Communist Party will first fight for the implementation of the Franco-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Cooperation and Mutual Assistance, whether in peacetime or if war has become a reality. However, there is currently no reason to assume that the war instigators' conspiracies will succeed. The forces of peace now have sufficient strength to prevent the warmongers' tricks and can save all countries in the world from falling into a new abyss of war. However, the intensified activities of the war instigators deserve our deep vigilance. It shows that the struggle for peace must be intensified in Finland."

　　芬共报纸论法共意共领袖声明
    【新华社陕北七日电】塔斯社赫尔新基四日讯：芬共机关报“杜坎森·杉诺玛”报在题为“为争取和平而斗争”的社论中指出：“多列士与托格里亚蒂已经驳斥了战争贩子们所说的苏联企图侵略的荒谬谰言，并且有力地证明了社会主义苏联领导着争取和平的斗争，没有对任何国家作任何侵略的意图”。社论指出：“很显然，法国共产党将首先为实施法苏友好合作互助协定而斗争，不管是在和平情况下，或者在如果战争已经成为事实的情况下。但是，目前并没有理由可以假定战争挑拨者的阴谋会成功。和平势力现在有着足够强大的力量，能够阻止战争贩子的诡计，可以挽救世界各国不坠入新战争的深渊。但是，战争挑拨者的加紧活动，是值得我们深加警惕的。它表明在芬兰必须加紧争取和平的斗争”。
