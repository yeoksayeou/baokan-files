Highways and Plains Intersect
Postal Routes Smooth in Towns and Villages
Major Achievements in North China Transportation Construction

[This newspaper reported] With the concerted efforts of the People's Government and the broad masses, North China's transportation construction has made great achievements. Railways are gradually being restored, highways are being actively built and repaired, and postal and telecommunications are being strengthened and adjusted step by step. In North China, we now have 32,000 li of highways (after the victory against Japan, the Kuomintang controlled no more than 1,000 li in North China). From Duolun in the north to Longhai in the south, from the Bohai Sea in the east to Tongpu in the west, they are unobstructed everywhere from plains to mountains. It connects all large and medium-sized cities and most small cities in the region. Three main north-south lines run through: the Pinghan Highway from Beiping to Qixian in the south, with only Anyang as an isolated point not yet connected; the Pingda Highway from Beiping to the Yellow River, connecting Kaifeng across the river; the Jinpu Highway from Tianjin to Dezhou, crossing the Yellow River to Heze. There are also four east-west lines: from Shanhaiguan to Shangdu in Chahar, from Tianjin to Daixian in Shanxi, from Bozhen to Taiyuan, and from Dexian to Linfen. Currently, under the North China Highway Administration system, there are 250 trucks regularly dispatched, and the number of commercial vehicles is even greater. No less than 30 commercial vehicles run the Ping (Beiping) - Shi (Shijiazhuang) line every day.

Railways are being actively rushed to repair. The entire Zhengtai line (only the isolated city of Taiyuan is not yet open), the entire De (Zhou) - Shi (Jiazhuang) line, the Pingyu (Guan) section of the Beining Line, the Pingzhang section of the Pingsui Railway, the Pingzhuo (County) section of the Pinghan Railway, the Jincang (County) section of the Jinpu Railway, the entire Pinggu Line, the Yu (Ci) - Ling (Shi) section of the Tongpu Railway, and the Han (Dan) - She (County) Railway, newly built entirely by the Liberated Areas, are open for traffic and ticket sales.

In terms of main postal routes (postal routes connecting counties are called main lines), there are 22,851 li, excluding Chahar North, Jicha, and Jidong. Rural postal routes from each county to the district total 160,000 li, and routes from the district to the village are even longer. Except for very small natural villages and some areas in Chahar North, all urban and rural areas have postal services, including letters, newspapers, remittances, and packages. The main lines adopt relay transportation, with people stopping but mail not stopping, so transportation is possible day and night. Due to the lack of modern transportation, most transportation relies on human power, and our postal workers have shown a high degree of initiative. Post offices stipulate that bicycle transportation should cover 120 to 180 li per day, carrying 60 to 80 jin. Some postal workers in Jinnan and Jizhong sometimes travel 240 li per day by bicycle, carrying up to 100 jin at most. Before the liberation of Beiping, the average amount of mail from Shijiazhuang to Zhuoxian was 500 to 1,000 jin per day. Since March, the amount of mail going south from Beiping has reached 3,000 to 4,000 jin per day. The post offices in Beiping and Tianjin each receive about 20,000 letters per day. After the north-south postal service was opened, an average of 12,000 jin of mail landed at Qinhuangdao every day. The transportation of these mails relies mostly on the manpower of postal workers.

Long-distance telephones connect all large and medium-sized cities and some small cities in the region. Due to the failure to fully standardize material standards, some lines need scientific adjustments, so most lines are still in sectional calls and have not yet been fully direct. This adjustment and modification work is now being carried out gradually.

　　山地平原公路纵横
    城镇乡村邮线畅通
    华北交通建设获重大成就
    【本报讯】经过人民政府和广大群众的协力，华北区的交通建设已经有了很大的成就。铁路逐渐恢复，公路积极增修，邮政电讯都在一步步的加强和调整。在华北，我们现有三万二千里（华里、下同）公路（抗战胜利后国民党在华北控制的公路从未超过一千里），北起多伦、南至陇海，东自渤海、西迄同蒲，从平原到山地，到处畅通无阻。它连系着全区所有大中城市和绝大部分小城市。三条纵干线贯通南北：平汉公路从北平至淇县南，中间只有安阳一孤点未通；平大公路从北平至黄河，隔河接连开封；津浦公路从天津至德州，并越黄河可到菏泽。另有四条横贯东西：从山海关到察北商都，从天津到山西代县，从泊镇到太原，从德县到临汾。现在华北公路总局系统下，经常出动的卡车就有二百五十辆，商车为数更多，每天跑平石（家庄）一线的商车就不下三十部。
    铁路正在积极赶修。已经通车售票的有正太全线（仅尚有太原孤城未通），德（州）石（家庄）全线，北宁线平榆（关）段，平绥路平张段，平汉路平涿（县）段，津浦路津沧（县）段，平古全线，同蒲路榆（次）灵（石）段及完全由解放区新修的邯（郸）涉（县）路。
    邮路干线方面（连系各县城的邮线称干线），除察北、冀察及冀东外，共有二万二千八百五十一里。乡邮线从各县至区共十六万里，从区到村的邮线更长。除了极小的自然村和察北某些地区，所有城乡都已通邮，包括信件、报纸、汇兑和包裹。干线采取接力运输、人停邮件不停的办法，白天黑夜都能运输。由于现代化的交通工具尚缺，大部运输依靠人力，我们的邮工表现了高度的积极性。邮局规定自行车运输每天行一百二十里至一百八十里，负重六十斤至八十斤。冀南、冀中某些邮工，以自行车运输时，每天有时行二百四十里，负重最多曾达百斤以上。北平解放前每天从石家庄到涿县的邮件平均五百至一千斤，三月份以来，每天从北平南下的邮件达三千至四千斤，平、津两邮局每天收信各约两万封，南北通邮后，每天从秦皇岛登陆的邮件，平均有一万二千斤。这些邮件的运输，绝大部分依靠邮工的人力。
    长途电话联系着全区所有的大中城市及一部小城市，由于材料标准未能完全统一，若干线路尚待科学的调整，故大部分线路还在分段通话，一时尚未全部直达。这一调整及改装工作，现正逐步进行中。
