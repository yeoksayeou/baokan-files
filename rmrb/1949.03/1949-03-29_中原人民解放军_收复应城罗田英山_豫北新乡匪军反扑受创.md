Another unit of the People's Liberation Army recovered Luotian and Yingshan, two cities on the border of Hubei and Anhui northeast of Hankou, on the 19th, killing and capturing some enemy troops. The remaining enemy fled northwest. On the same day, the People's Liberation Army captured Herong Town, east of Yichang, and captured some enemy troops at Hujiaochang, west of the town.
　　Xinhua News Agency, Luoyang, 26th: A unit of the People's Liberation Army, on the 19th, made a surprise attack on the Zhushan puppet security regiment entrenched in Guanduhe and Poshuigou, southwest of Zhushan City, capturing alive the puppet county magistrate and concurrently puppet security regiment commander, He Lihua, and the puppet Zhushan County Brigade Commander Zhang Xintian, along with 49 others. They killed and wounded 14 bandits.
　　Xinhua News Agency, Central Plains, 27th: More than 50 men from the 1st Company of the 1st Battalion of the 6th Detachment of the Kuomintang Central China "剿匪总司令部," led by Company Commander Chen Hanqing, carrying all their weapons, revolted in Dazui, Hanyang, on the 8th of this month, and safely arrived in the liberated area, where they were warmly welcomed by the local military and civilians.
　　Taihang Telegram: After controlling Xinxiang Airport, the People's Liberation Army in Northern Henan repelled the frantic counterattacks of more than six regiments of Wang Sanzhu's bandit troops, affiliated with Chiang Kai-shek's 40th Army, a total of more than 20 times on the 12th, 13th, and 17th. On the night of the 11th, our army suddenly advanced into the suburbs of Xinxiang, occupied more than ten villages west of the city, and controlled the enemy airport. The remaining bandits in the city were unaware. Before dawn on the 12th, Chiang Kai-shek's 40th Army officers and Wang Sanzhu's bandits drove directly to the airport by car, waiting to board a plane and flee south. Just as they left the city, they were severely attacked by a unit of the People's Liberation Army ambushed in the area with dense firepower. The enemy left more than 20 bodies and fled back into the city. The enemy then hastily gathered two regiments and, under the cover of artillery fire, launched a fierce attack on our positions in Baliying and Luzhuang, southwest of Xinxiang City, but were repulsed by our grenades after repeated charges. According to incomplete statistics for the three days, we killed more than 250 enemy officers and men, wounded more than 400, and captured 154. In total we killed, wounded and captured 804 enemies. We seized a total of six 50 and 60mm mortars, six light machine guns, 87 rifles, four Mauser pistols, one American-made submachine gun, and 7,224 rounds of ammunition.
