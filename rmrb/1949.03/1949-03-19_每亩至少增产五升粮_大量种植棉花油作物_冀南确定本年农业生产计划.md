Jinnan Telegram: The Jinnan First Party Representative Meeting, convened on February 10th and lasting seven days, adopted the Jinnan District's 1949 agricultural production plan based on the needs of the new democratic national construction and the People's Liberation War, combined with the specific conditions of the district. The Jinnan plain area is relatively fertile, lacks mines and large cities, and the national economic income is mainly from agriculture, with a large proportion of commodity economy. After eight years of the War of Resistance Against Japan and two and a half years of the Liberation War, the people of the entire district have established and consolidated the people's regime, carried out various peasant struggles, and completed land reform in more than 80% of the villages, resulting in an unprecedented increase in the production enthusiasm of the broad masses of farmers. Therefore, under the principle of vigorously restoring and developing agricultural production, and planned restoration and development of industry and household sideline occupations, an agricultural production plan was formulated, requiring a general increase in production and expansion of the planting of cash crops. The entire district will plant 5.25 million mu of cotton, striving for an average yield of 70 jin of seed cotton per mu. Oil crops such as sesame and rapeseed will be planted on 320,000 mu, and each person is required to harvest an average of half a jin of hemp seeds. For the remaining grains and general sideline products, it is required to increase the yield of coarse grains by 5 shi sheng to 1 shi dou per mu on the existing basis. In order to effectively realize the production increase plan, the following arrangements are made: (1) Improve agricultural production conditions: Protect and increase livestock, strictly prohibit slaughtering, strengthen veterinary work, promote insemination, and breed more than 60,000 heads throughout the year, and purchase 25,500 heads from outside. Promote pig raising and fertilizer accumulation: It is required that an average of one to one and a half carts of fertilizer be applied per mu of dry land. Repair, purchase, and transform agricultural implements, generally requiring an increase of one-tenth. In disaster areas, focus on the repair and purchase of small agricultural implements, while in general areas, vigorously add large agricultural implements. To this end, one or two agricultural implement manufacturing plants will be established in the entire district, and each special district and county will focus on restoring manufacturing plants, blacksmith shops, and agricultural implement supply and marketing cooperatives to achieve deep plowing and meticulous cultivation. All un-winter-plowed land should be spring-plowed, striving for one more harrowing. General crops require one more hoeing, and it is called to hoe wheat, pull weeds, and apply top dressing. Organize mass selection and seed soaking, focusing on promoting 30,000 mu of "August 1st" millet, 50,000 mu of "Yulinbai" and Guangzong wheat, and 30,000 mu of Sizi cotton. (2) Expand cultivated area: Strive to eliminate all blockhouses, boundary ditches, road protection ditches, stockade base and highways explicitly abolished by the administrative office left over by the Japanese and puppets, and all ripe wasteland. Strive to reclaim all the wasteland since the War of Resistance Against Japan in general counties and districts, and individual counties such as Qiuxian should eliminate some or most of it. A large amount of hemp and alfalfa should also be planted on wasteland that cannot be eliminated for the time being and on the ground beside the road. Wetlands and water pits and ditches should be planted with as much shrub willow, reeds, and lotus roots as possible. (3) Prevent disasters: Manage rivers and open canals, cultivate and repair main stream embankments and repair canals, and strive to prevent breaches in the four main streams of the Yun, Wei, Zhang, Fu, and North Li rivers. In addition, two sluice gates will be built in the Wei and Yun river systems, and ten sluice gates will be built in the Fuyang River system. In areas prone to leaching all year round, plan to dig canals for drainage and divert water into the main stream. Restore old wells, support the masses in repairing and purchasing waterwheels and windlasses, and plan to build 3,000 new waterwheels and repair 1,000 old waterwheels, and repair 8,000 old wells. To this end, each special district can organize a well-drilling team, and the government will provide loans to organize the masses to cooperate in well-drilling. More river-penetrating wells should be drilled in a planned manner along the banks of the Fu and Wei rivers. Call on the masses to restore and build brick kilns to supply brick materials for well-drilling. And take various measures (mainly organizing the masses to capture and fight) to eliminate insect pests; plant trees and afforestation. The entire district should plant 160,000 trees, and restore 200,000 trees for windbreak forests and fruit forests. In addition, 250,000 trees can be planted along the main highways and the banks of the Fu and Wei rivers in the entire district. In order to solve the problem of saplings, the public invests in operating 800 mu of nurseries, two forestry companies and one ranch, and each county establishes nurseries of about 30 mu. At the same time, private nurseries should be organized. Loan 2.5 million jin of grain and 250 million Jicha (冀钞) to support production in disaster areas. Loan 1.75 million to support the masses in non-disaster areas to purchase and loan draught animals, seeds, repair and purchase agricultural implements and other sideline production. All supply and marketing cooperatives and production promotion cooperatives are responsible for purchasing and transporting draught animals and seeds of early-maturing crops, and lending or selling them to the masses. (4) Organize and carry out the cooperative mutual aid movement, reward labor heroes, technical experts, and inventions, establish the idea of getting rich through hard work, and focus on promoting family settlement plans. Utilize slack farming seasons, counties and districts organize cooperative training classes, striving for three to five trainees per village. Organize small mutual aid groups based on seasons, conditions, and needs, under the principles of voluntariness and mutual benefit. In areas with this foundation, past experience should be summarized, shortcomings should be overcome, and further expansion and consolidation should be carried out. In areas with a poor foundation, adopt typical demonstrations and gradually promote the method, opposing forced orders, chasing numbers, and formalistic deviations. Each county and city should pay attention to discovering and cultivating various labor heroes and thrifty models in the production movement, pay attention to summarizing and promoting production experience, so as to improve labor efficiency. Call on women to participate in agricultural labor. In areas with this habit, 50% of young women should participate in major agricultural labor. Other areas should gradually participate as well. And educate and transform lazy people to engage in production. Hold various production exhibitions, and reward excellent varieties and new inventions and creations.
