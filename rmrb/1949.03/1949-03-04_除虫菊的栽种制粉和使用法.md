The cultivation, milling, and use of pyrethrum
    Pyrethrum is a poisonous plant that blooms from late May to early June. The flowers contain many insect-repelling components that can repel and prevent aphids and caterpillars on peaches, plums, and cherries, as well as cutworms, beetles, cotton aphids, leafhoppers on other crops, and flea beetles and aphids on eggplants, melons, and cabbage.

    Cultivation of pyrethrum:
    Pyrethrum is not afraid of the cold but is afraid of moisture. It is most suitable for planting in well-drained sandy soil. It can also be planted in other soil types as long as they are not wetlands. There are two planting methods: sowing and division. Both spring and autumn are suitable for cultivation. In warm areas, it is best to plant in autumn, and in cold areas, it is best to plant in spring. When planting, carefully cultivate the selected land and create a seedbed. Mix well-rotted soil and manure underneath and level it, then sprinkle a very thin layer of diluted manure water, and cover with a thin layer of soil. Mix the seeds with fine sand or ash, etc., and sow them on the prepared seedbed. Finally, use a sieve to lightly cover with a layer of soil and cover with rice straw or wheat straw. Water frequently with a watering can to maintain adequate moisture. After germination, remove the cover straw and thin out dense seedlings, paying more attention to weeding. In this way, spring-planted seedlings can be transplanted in autumn or the following spring; autumn-planted seedlings can be transplanted in the following spring or the following autumn (pay attention to cold protection in winter). When transplanting, the cultivated seedbed or paddy field can be ridged at intervals of one or two feet, and the seedlings can be planted one by one inside, with intervals of seven or eight inches or one foot. After they survive, apply diluted manure water near the roots, not too close and not touching the leaves. Fertilize every spring and autumn, preferably using well-rotted compost, soybean cake, and manure. Weed and cultivate regularly. After picking the flowers, cut the plants back to about two inches above the ground, because the plants will weaken after three or four years of transplanting. It is best to replace them with new and vigorous seedlings.

    Manufacturing of pyrethrum powder:
    According to analysis, the pyrethrin content in the flowers is 0.4% to 1.2%. The content in stems and leaves is about 0.04%. Pyrethrin is yellow and oily and has a strong insecticidal effect. It must come into contact with the insect's body to kill it. It enters through the stomata and then spreads throughout the body, causing paralysis and death; or the insect eats it, causing the destruction of its tissue structure and poisoning to death. However, it only kills cold-blooded animals and has no harm to warm-blooded animals and plants (cold-blooded animals refer to insects, such as scarabs and June beetles; warm-blooded animals refer to those with warm blood, such as cattle and sheep).

    When the flowers are about to wither and the pollen turns yellow, they can be picked. Dry the flowers thoroughly, grind or crush them into powder as finely as possible, and sift them through the finest flour sieve to create pyrethrum powder (the finer the powder, the stronger the effect, but the finer it is, the harder it is to preserve, and the active ingredients are easily lost). It is best to store it in a dry, low-temperature place. If stored at normal temperature, the effectiveness can be reduced by more than 30% in one year, so pay close attention to preservation.

    Use of pyrethrum powder:
    There are three methods: 1. Dusting method: Mix one or two ounces of pyrethrum powder with ten ounces to one pound of wood ash (the wood ash must be low in soil content and sifted finely before use). Mix well and sprinkle it on the plants when there is dew to kill all vegetable-eating insects and crop pests. If you use two parts of pyrethrum powder, seven parts of fried buckwheat flour (other flours are also acceptable), and one part of tobacco powder, mix them evenly. This is most effective against bedbugs, fleas, lice, and other pests. 2. Spraying method: One method is to use one ounce of pyrethrum powder, half an ounce to one ounce of soap, and ten to fifteen pounds of river water. The method is to first mix the pyrethrum powder with a small amount of water to form a paste, then dissolve the soap in two or three pounds of hot water. Add the remaining water and finally add the prepared pyrethrum paste to the soap solution and stir vigorously before using. Another method is to use one ounce of pyrethrum powder, two ounces of kerosene, one ounce of soap, and ten to fifteen pounds of river water. The method is to soak the pyrethrum powder in kerosene for one or two days, wipe off the residue with a cloth, cut the soap into pieces, add hot water to make a soap emulsion, and then slowly drip the kerosene extract into the soap solution and stir vigorously to form the spray. The above-mentioned solutions should be sprayed immediately after preparation to prevent reducing their effectiveness. 3. Smoking method: Pyrethrum powder mixed with sawdust can be made into mosquito coils. Pyrethrum leaves can be twisted into mosquito ropes, which produce little smoke but can repel mosquitoes. Carrying pyrethrum powder in the summer and smoking it to repel mosquitoes at night is the easiest way.

### 除虫菊的栽种制粉和使用法

　　除虫菊的栽种制粉和使用法
    除虫菊是一种有毒的植物，五月末至六月初开花。花里面含着很多驱除虫类的成份，对于桃李樱桃上的蜜虫毛虫，其他农作物的夜盗虫、蛤虫、棉花上的绵虫、浮尘子，和茄子瓜类白菜的猊虫、蚜虫等，都能驱除和预防。
    除虫菊的栽种法：
    除虫菊不怕冷，却怕湿，栽种到容易排水的沙性土壤里最合适，只要不是湿地的别的土质也能栽植，栽植法有播种和分析两种，春秋两季都能养殖，暖地秋季里栽好，寒地春季栽好。栽种时，把选好的地仔细耕耘，作成苗床样子，把熟土和粪在下面拌好捞平，再撒上很薄的大粪水，上面盖一层薄土。把种子用细砂或灰等拌起来，种在薄田上，最后用筛子薄筛上一层土掩住，再用谷草或稻草盖上。常常用喷壶浇水，保持住适当的湿气。发芽后，就可把盖草去了，检去密苗，要更注意除草。这样，春季种的，秋天或来春就能移栽；秋天种的，可在第二年春天或在第二年秋天移栽（冬天必须注意防寒）。移栽时，可把耕好的苗床稻子的地，隔一尺或二尺上下打成垄沟，在里面一株一株的栽去，要隔七八寸或一尺的间隔。活了后，用稀粪水下在根边，不要太近，也不要粘到叶上。每年春秋两季要施肥，最好把堆肥、豆饼、大粪等十分腐熟后再用。经常要除草中耕。摘花后，应当在地上约二寸处拔去，因为移栽后三四年就衰弱没劲了，可再换栽新而有力的苗子。
    除虫菊的制造法：
    根据分析，花里的除虫菊素有千分之四到千分之十二。梗和叶含量约有万分之四。除虫菊素是黄色的，象油一样，杀虫的劲很大，必须使它接触虫的身上，才能杀死。从气孔进去，再到全身，使它麻痹而死；或者使虫吃了，虫子身上组织机构破坏中毒而死。但只能杀冷血动物，对热血动物和植物没有妨害（冷血动物是指虫类，象瞎撞子、金翅亮等；热血动物是指着血带有热气的，象牛、羊等）。
    花快谢落，花粉变黄色时，可以摘下来，把花弄得非常干燥，用磨或碾压成粉末，越细越好，用最细的面箩筛出来，就造成除虫菊粉（粉末越细劲越大，但越细越难保存，有效成份容易走失）。最好拣空气干燥，温度最低的地方保存才好，若是放在平常的温度里，一年的工夫，能减去百分之三十以上的效力，所以得很好注意保存。
    除虫菊的使用法：
    有以下三个办法：一、撒粉法：用一两除虫菊粉，兑上十两到一斤重的草木灰（草灰必须是带土性很少的，要用箩筛细以后才用），搅拌匀合以后，趁着有露水的时候撒上去，才能杀死一切吃菜的虫，和庄稼害虫，若是用二分除虫菊粉，和七分炒好的荞麦面（别的面也行），加上一分烟面子，调合均匀以后，不论药臭虫、跳蚤、虱子等，都最有效力。二、喷雾法：一种是用一两除虫菊粉，半两到一两肥皂，十斤到十五斤河水；制法是先用很少的水，把除虫菊粉，合得象泥一样，再用二、三斤热水，把肥皂化开，再把其余的水加进去，最后把合成的除虫菊膏，扔到肥皂液汁里面，使劲搅拌，然后使用；另一种是用一两除虫菊粉，二两火油，一两肥皂，十斤到十五斤河水；制法是先把除虫菊粉，放在火油里泡一两天，用布抹去渣子，把肥皂切成碎片，加上热水，制成肥皂乳液，再把火油泡出来的液汁，慢慢滴在肥皂的液汁里去，使劲一搅拌就成啦。上面说的药液调制以后，应该马上用喷雾器或别的东西，喷洒上去，不要等时间多了，防备减低作用。三、熏烟法：用除虫菊粉，合上锯末子，能制成蚊香。除虫菊的叶子，能搓成蚊绳，冒烟不大，就能熏住蚊子。夏天带着除虫菊粉，晚上熏蚊子是最便易的。
