　　Swatting Locusts
　　Anyang Allocates Rice as Reward
　　[Taihang News] Locust nymphs have been discovered in the Eighth District of Anyang. The county government has dispatched cadres to organize the masses to dig up eggs and swat locusts. It has also allocated 300 catties of millet to reward active locust-swatters.
　　(Another dispatch) Locust nymphs have been found emerging from the soil in locust-affected areas of Taihang, Anyang, and other counties from last year. In Matoujian, Ninth District, Anyang, the area covered by locust nymphs has reached fifty to sixty mu, with an average density of thirty to fifty nymphs per square step. The ninth district has spread to seventy-five villages; they have recently been discovered near the Eighth District of Lin County as well. To this end, the Taihang Fifth Prefectural Committee of the Chinese Communist Party has issued an urgent notice, calling for intensified organization to eliminate nymphs. The notice specifically points out that the biggest obstacle in the nymph-elimination struggle is the paralysis of leadership thinking. It was also decided that under the leadership of the county production committee, last year's locust-control organizations at all levels should be restored to patiently and meticulously organize the masses to eliminate nymphs. In order to avoid conflicts between nymph-elimination and support for the front line, women and children can be vigorously organized.

　　扑打蝗蝻
    安阳拨米奖励
    【太行讯】安阳八区发现蝗蝻。县府已派出干部前往组织群众刨卵扑打。并拨发小米三百斤，以奖励剿蝗积极分子。
    （又讯）太行安阳等县，去年蝗灾地区发现蝗蝻出土。安阳九区马头涧，蝗蝻面积已达五、六十亩，每方步平均密度三十——五十个，九区已蔓延七十五村；林县八区近亦发现。为此，中共太行五地委特发出紧急通知，号召加紧组织灭蝻，通知中特指出：灭蝻斗争中，最大障碍是领导思想的麻痹。并决定：在县生产委员会领导下，恢复去年各级剿蝗机构，耐心、细致组织群众灭蝻。为不致因灭蝻与支援前线工作发生矛盾，可大力组织妇女、儿童。
