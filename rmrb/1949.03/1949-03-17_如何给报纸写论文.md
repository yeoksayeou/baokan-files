　　How to Write Newspaper Essays
    By Chernyshevsky
    Translated by Wang Ziye
    The entire history of our Party and newspapers have always had a very close connection.
    Leadership is impossible without newspapers. Comrade Stalin's famous instruction has become a household saying. It is generally acknowledged that newspapers are the most important weapon for improving the work of the Party, Soviet, and economic departments. Therefore, Party activists should use the newspaper platform as often as possible.
    The author of a newspaper essay has more listeners than a speaker making a speech at a mass meeting. Through the newspaper, the author speaks to and influences thousands of readers. The direct pronouncements of leaders in newspapers are one of the effective ways of leading, and therefore Party workers should regard participating in newspaper work as their important duty.
    To become a true political activist, one should develop talents in all aspects, and should learn the ability to speak in public, whether orally or in writing articles in newspapers, with proficiency and ease. However, many Party workers are still not actively participating in newspaper work, and in individual cases even treat such a responsible task incorrectly. Recently, the "Red Crimea" newspaper reported that the Party Secretary of the Nizhnegorsk region has a peculiar understanding of cooperating with newspapers. When he wants to use the newspaper platform, he tells the district newspaper editor: "You write the essay, and I'll sign it." Such essays should not be published, as it proves a lack of understanding of the importance of newspaper pronouncements, irresponsibility towards readers, and a lack of thinking.
    When you want to speak on a certain issue, you should not expect someone else to write it down for you; you should write it yourself.
    There is never a ready-made unified method for how to write an essay, nor can there be. Everyone writes in their own unique way. However, the advice given by some outstanding writers and political commentators is ultimately helpful for inexperienced essay writers. Let us quote some famous sayings!
    When an author begins to write, they should accumulate material and put something new of their own into the essay, their own thoughts, expressed in their own language, and written in their own style. Every political commentator has their own style. In excellent and vivid essays, the personal characteristics of the author are often left behind. Belinsky said: "My essay and I are often an inseparable thing" (Collected Correspondence, Volume 3, page 306). Unfortunately, in our newspapers, we often encounter many monotonous materials. Some authors often write articles according to one model and one style, so it is difficult to distinguish their individual characteristics.
    What we need are not all essays, but only those that can influence readers and affect events. Dobrolyubov pointed out about a certain short essay: "If the advantage of this essay lies in its stability, then its disadvantage also lies in its blandness" (Complete Works, Volume 4, page 372). Such bland essays should have no place in our newspapers.
    When an author takes up the pen to write, they should first think about what they want to say, whether what they are preparing to write is important and meaningful, whether what is written in the article is beneficial, or on the contrary, a waste of time, because readers do not value their essay.
    It is quite clear that every author hopes to write an essay that is substantial, clear, and satisfying. Any author strives to make their essay leave a deep impression and arouse resonance in the reader's mind. A good essay cannot be written in one go. No, it must gradually take shape in the mind. Before a newspaper essay appears, meticulous preparation must be made, the theme must be carefully considered, and the theme must be thought through thoroughly. Materials must be accumulated in one's own handbook, and key points, facts, outlines, and opinions must be systematically written down - in a word, everything that is to be written in the essay.
    Chernyshevsky said: "Think, think, and think again, otherwise it is not worth writing; what is written without careful consideration is worthless in itself" (Complete Works, Volume 1, page 275).
    Vladimir Ilyich carefully thought about and prepared his newspaper essays. "Lenin's Collected Works" unfolds before us a creative laboratory of Lenin, and we might as well explore the process of the production and appearance of some of his essays.
    The works of Lenin and Stalin are irreplaceable practical guides for us. We should draw advice and instructions from these works. At the same time, when studying the works of Lenin and Stalin, and when studying Lenin's correspondence, Party workers should learn the art of writing commentaries, and learn how to polish words and sentences.
    In 1913, Vladimir Ilyich said in a letter to an author contributing to the "Education" magazine: "Your article has been received and read. In my opinion, the theme is well chosen, and the discussion is correct, but the wording is not polished enough" (Complete Works, Volume 29, page 93).
    In commenting on this letter, Krupskaya pointed out in the book "Learning Work Methods from Lenin":
    "Thus, choosing the theme, discussing the theme, and polishing the wording are precisely the three major things that Ilyich paid attention to."
    Vivid and lively content and profound themes are inexhaustible. Practical workers will never suffer from the exhaustion of themes: life itself will provide them. Party workers are in the midst of life, observing the continuous growth of new people, and meeting them every day. The whole problem lies in how to discard the secondary from the massive and complex material obtained from impressions and observations, and pick out the most urgent themes and problems that need to be solved urgently. It is even more necessary to correctly discuss and explain the themes from the Party's standpoint, and to find and expose the first and foremost, the main things.
    Some Party workers try to be all-encompassing when writing essays. The authors of these essays always want to solve all problems at once. They jump from one problem to another, but none of the problems are seriously discussed. This cannot be called an essay, but rather an artificial combination of various chapters. The scope of the task should be defined, the central theme should be defined, and a precise discussion should be made. Such an essay is complete.
    In order to correctly discuss the selected theme, one should: carefully study the problem, collect prominent facts, and reliable examples. But sometimes, although the theme is correctly defined, some authors are unable to thoroughly discuss it.
    Party workers write essays for millions of people to read. This requires a lot of effort in the wording. One should strive to express one's thoughts in a beautiful form and describe them in clear language.
    The form of narration depends on who the essay is written for and for whom it is written. Do not use words that are encountered for the first time or accidental words, and do not use lengthy sentences, clichés, and exaggerated expressions. One should strive to avoid ready-made forms, and to find appropriate and fresh language in order to accurately and clearly explain the problem. Of course, this cannot be achieved overnight, but requires a process. Experience is beneficial. Hard work can overcome everything. Finally, the pen will become tame and can be used freely.
    Language cannot be measured by outdated standards. The language and vocabulary of the workers are constantly enriched. Before the revolution, a local newspaper once checked whether the peasants could understand the language of the newspaper. The results of the inspection showed that the vast majority of the peasant masses could not understand the newspaper's essays. The peasants did not understand the following words: "agricultural technology," "result," "potash," "control," "resistance," "environment," "stagnation," "conditions," etc.
    This is a thing of the past. The new, Soviet workers and the new, Soviet peasants have been integrated with culture, books, and the wealth of the Russian language. But sometimes our newspapers still cannot write essays suitable for a wide range of readers.
    In a letter to all editors of the "China Youth Daily," Comrade Stalin wrote:
    "The style of the essays in the 'China Youth Daily' should be simplified well, and the editors should be instructed to write simply, use short sentences, and avoid using foreign words as much as possible, as Ilyich did" (Complete Works, Volume 7, page 155).
    We should learn from Lenin and Stalin to write simple and clear articles. Kalinin once called on the staff of Party newspapers to learn Comrade Stalin's "conciseness, clarity, and refinement of language." He said, "Try to express the ideas that Stalin said in short narratives!"
    Writing an essay should start with a plan. The author should have a clear plan, even if it is a rough plan. It is absolutely impossible to regard writing a plan as a routine matter. What is important is that the plan should be carefully considered and the ideas should be clarified. Then the title must be considered. The title reveals the content of the essay. The title is an organic part of the essay. All great political commentators and writers attach great importance to the choice of titles. Any author is always concerned about what name to give to their hard work. Enthusiastic writers always want to choose a simple and novel title for their essays. Authors should strive to avoid using stale titles that cannot explain anything.
    Gorky once wrote: "The beginning, the first sentence, is the most difficult. It seems to give the tone to the whole work in music, and it often takes a long time to find it" ("How We Write"). Some authors get dizzy because they take pains to find unique and ingenious beginnings. They always try to avoid using simple beginnings. Other comrades believe that the beginning should be written in a gorgeous way, and some people think that an essay cannot be written without a long introduction. For such authors, it is best to ask them to recall Belinsky's warning: "If the first line is too far away, then this essay must be full of nonsense and far from the topic; if the first line touches the event, then this essay is a good article."
    Lenin's essays never use lengthy prefaces. For example, in the article "On the Nature of Our Newspaper," Lenin did not elaborate on the significance and tasks of the newspaper, but started with the following words:
    "Political agitation on old topics - too much space is occupied by empty talk about politics. Too little space is occupied by the construction of new life, and by the facts of this construction. ... Why use two hundred to four hundred lines to talk about these simple, well-known, clear phenomena that are already familiar to the masses, instead of twenty or ten lines?" (Complete Works, Volume 23, page 212).
    Lenin often wrote very short essays on the most urgent and difficult topics. The article "The Land Ownership of Russian Landlords and Peasants," published in "Pravda" before the revolution, totaled less than eighty lines.
    Comrade Stalin's essay on the Lena incident, "It's Flowing!", occupied one hundred lines. Comrade Stalin wrote an essay "Our Goal" in the first issue of "Pravda" - a programmatic essay, which was no more than one hundred lines in total.
    Writing good articles is not an easy task, but it is respectable, and participating in Party newspapers is a glorious task. Our newspapers very much need to cooperate with Party workers, to cooperate with people who are familiar with life, and to cooperate with people who have theoretical cultivation and practical work experience. Actively cooperating with newspapers is the responsibility of Party workers.

　　如何给报纸写论文
    巧尔尼雪夫作
    王子野节译
    我们党的整个历史和报纸历来都有非常密切的联系。
    没有报纸就无法领导。斯大林同志的这个有名的指示已成家喻户晓的口头禅了。一般都承认报纸乃是改善党的、苏维埃的和经济的各部门工作的最重要的武器。因此，党的活动分子应当尽可能经常利用报纸的讲坛。
    报纸论文的作者比之在群众大会上作演讲的演说者拥有更多的听众。经过报纸，作者与成千上万的读者说话，影响他们。领导者在报纸上的直接的言论乃是领导的有效方式之一，因而党的工作人员应当把参加报纸工作视为自己的重要职责。
    要想成为一个真正的政治活动家，就应当发展各方面的才干，就应当学会当众发表言论的本领，不论口头的也罢，不论在报纸上写文章也罢，都能熟练自如。可是有许多党的工作人员还是很不积极地参加报纸工作，而在个别的场合甚至很不正确地对待这样一件负责的工作。最近“红色克里米亚”报上说，尼日列戈尔斯基区的党委书记对于与报纸合作有一种奇特的理解。他想使用报纸的讲坛时，就告诉区的报纸的编辑：“你写好论文，我签个名。”象这样的论文不应发表，它证明了对报纸言论重要性的不理解，对读者不负责，不用脑筋。
    当你对于某一问题想说话的时候，你不要指望另外还有一个人拿笔给你写下来，你应当自己动手写。
    如何写论文从来都没有什么现成的统一的方法，而且也不能有。每个人都是用自己的特有的方法去写的。可是某些卓越的作家和政论家所说的忠告对于没有经验的论文写作者终究是有帮助的。以下就让我们来引一些名言警语吧！
    作者开始写作时应积蓄材料并在论文中放进某些自己的新的东西，自己的思想，用自己的语言表达出来，用自己的文体写下来。每一个政论家都有自己的风格。在优美的、鲜明的论文中常常都留下该文作者的个人特点的痕迹。柏林斯基说：“我的论文和我常常是一种不可分离的东西”（通信集第三卷三○六页）。可惜在我们的报纸上还常碰到许多千篇一律的材料。有些作者常常都按一个模型，一种格调写文章，所以很难辨别他们各人的特点。
    我们所需要的并不是一切的论文，而只是那些能对读者发生影响，对事件发生作用的论文。杜勃洛柳包夫对某一短论指出说：“如果说这篇论文的优点是在于四平八稳，那么它的缺点也就在于不痛不痒”（全集第四卷三七二页）。这种不痛不痒的论文在我们报纸上是不能有位置的。
    当作者执笔为文之际，他首先应当想一想：他有什么话要说，他准备要写的东西是否重要和有意义，写在文章里的东西是有益的，或者相反地是徒费时间，因为读者不看重他的论文。
    十分明白，每个作者都希望写出有内容的，明确的令人满意的论文。任何一个作者都力图使他的论文留下深刻的印象，在读者心中引起反响。好的论文不能一挥而就，一气呵成。不是的，它要在脑子里逐渐形成，报纸论文的出现之前，先要作细密的准备工作，周密地思考主题，把主题思考成熟。必须在自己的手册中积蓄材料，系统地写下要点、事实、纲要、意见——一句话，论文里所要写的一切。
    车尔尼雪夫斯基说：“思索、思索再思索，否则就值不得写；没有经过深思熟虑而写下来的东西本身就一钱不值”（全集第一卷二七五页）。
    弗拉季米尔·伊里奇周密地思索和准备自己的报纸论文。“列宁文集”在我们面前展开了一个列宁的创作实验室，我们不妨来探究一下他的某些论文的产生和出现的过程。
    列宁和斯大林的著作对于我们乃是不能代替的实践指南。我们应从这些著作中吸取忠告和指示。同时，研究列宁和斯大林的著作时，研究列宁的通信时，党的工作人员应当学习写评论的艺术，学习如何推敲词句。
    一九一三年弗拉季米尔·伊里奇在给一个投稿“教育”杂志的作者的信上说：“你的文章收到了，也读过了。依我看来，主题选得好，论述也正确，可是文词欠修饰”（全集二十九卷九三页）。
    在评论这封信时，克鲁普斯卡耶在“向列宁学习工作方法”一书内指出：
    “这样，选择主题，论述主题，文词修饰，这正是伊里奇所注意的三大要事。”
    生动活泼的内容深刻的主题是取之不竭的。实际的工作人员任何时候都不会感到主题枯竭之苦：生活本身就会提供出来。党的工作人员是处在生活之中，观察新人的不断的生长，每日都和他们碰面。全部问题是在于如何从印象和观察得来的大量而繁杂的材料中舍去次要的和挑出最迫切的主题，急需解决的问题。更必须正确地，按照党的立场观点来论述和解释主题，找出和揭露首先是第一等的，主要的东西。
    某些党的工作人员写论文时力图无所不包。这些论文的作者总想一下子解决一切问题。他们从一个问题又扯到另一问题，可是一个问题也没认真论述。这不能叫作论文，而是各个章节的人工的凑合。应当规定任务的范围，规定出中心的主题并作精密的论述。这样的论文才是完满的。
    为了正确地论述所选定的主题，应当：认真研究问题，搜集突出的事实，可靠的例证。但是有时候虽然正确地规定了主题，有些作者却又不能周密地论述它。
    党的工作人员写了论文给成千上万的人阅读。这就必须在文词上多下功夫。应当力求以优美的形式来表达自己的思想，以明显的语言来叙述它。
    叙述形式决定于论文是写给谁读的，为谁而写的。不要采用初次碰到的，偶然的词语，不要使用冗长的语句，陈词滥调和夸张的表现。应当力求避免现成的形式，而去寻找恰当的、新鲜的语言，以便准确地、明白地说明问题。当然，这不能一蹴而遂，而要经过一个过程的。经验是有益的事。辛勤努力就能战胜一切。最后笔杆就会变得驯服，可以运用自如。
    对于语言不能用陈旧的尺度去衡量它。劳动者的语言和词汇是在不断地丰富起来，在革命前，有一种地方报曾检查过农民对报纸的语言是否能懂得。检查结果是绝大多数的农民群众都读不懂报纸的论文。以下的一些词语农民是不懂得的：“农业技术”、“结果”、“加里”、“管制”、“抵抗”、“环境”、“沉滞”、“条件”等等。
    这已是过去的事了。新的、苏维埃的工人，新的、苏维埃的农民已和文化、书籍、俄文的财富结合在一起了。可是我们的报纸有时还不会写出适于广大读者阅读的论文。
    在给“青共真理报”全体编辑员的信上斯大林同志写道：
    “应当很好地把‘青共真理报’上的论文的文体弄得简单些，责成编辑同人写得简单些，使用简短的语句，尽可能不用外来语，如象伊里奇所作那样”（全集第七卷一五五页）。
    我们应当学习列宁和斯大林写简朴而明白的文章。加里宁曾号召党报的工作人员学习斯大林同志的“语言的精悍、明白和洗炼。”他说“试用简短的叙述来表达斯大林所说的思想！”
    写论文开始时要有计划。作者应当有明确的计划，即使是粗略的计划也行。决不可把写计划看成例行公事。重要的是计划要经过深思熟虑，思想弄明确。而后必须考虑标题，标题是揭示论文的内容的。标题乃是论文的有机部份。一切大政论家和作家都很重视标题的选择。任何一个作者对于自己的苦心之作取一个什么名称总是关心的。热心写作的人总想给自己的论文选择一个简单而又新颖的标题。作者应力求避免选用陈腐的，什么也不能说明的标题。
    高尔基有一次写道：“开头，第一句是最困难的。它好象在音乐里给予全篇作品以音调，往往要费很长的时间才找到它”（“我们怎样写作”）。有些作者因为费心寻找特异的，奇巧的开头而弄得头晕目眩。他们总是想方设法不用简单的开头。另外一些同志认为开头应当写得华丽些，又有些人认为没有长的导言就不能写论文。对于这样的作者最好请他们回想一下柏林斯基的警语：“假如第一行落笔太远，那么这篇论文一定是废话连篇，离题千里；假如第一行就接触事件，那么这篇论文就是好文章。”
    列宁的论文从不用冗长的前言。例如“论我们报纸的性质”一文，列宁并没有把报纸的意义和任务展开论述，他是用以下的话开头的：
    “对于旧题目的政治鼓动——对政治的空谈占据的篇幅太多了。对新生活的建设，对于这种建设的事实所占篇幅则太少了。……关于这些简单的、众所周知的、明白的确已为群众所熟习的现象，为什么不用二十行十行来说，而要用二百行至四百行呢？”（全集二十三卷二一二页）
    列宁常对最急迫、最困难的题目写出非常简短的论文。革命前发表在“真理报”上的“俄国的大地主的和农民的土地所有制”一文统共不到八十行。
    斯大林同志关于连拿事件所写的论文“奔流起来了！”占了一百行。斯大林同志在第一期“真理报”上写了一篇论文“我们的目标”——纲领式的论文，全文也不过一百行。
    写好文章不是件容易的事，但是应受尊敬的，参加党报是光荣的任务。我们的报纸非常需要与党的工作人员合作，与熟识生活的人们合作，与有理论修养而又有实际工作经验的人们合作。积极地与报纸合作，这是党的工作人员的责任。
