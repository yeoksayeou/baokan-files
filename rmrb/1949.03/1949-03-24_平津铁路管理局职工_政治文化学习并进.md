　　Tianjin-Beijing Railway Administration Employees Advance in Political and Cultural Learning
    [Our Newspaper] The employees of the Tianjin-Beijing Railway Administration are enthusiastically learning politics, culture, and technology. On February 25th, more than two hundred workers in the bureau voluntarily established a staff school, divided into four groups: advanced, intermediate, primary, and literacy classes, to study politics, Chinese language, basic railway knowledge, arithmetic, abacus, and other subjects. A radio specialty class was also set up to focus on technical studies. They use their lunch and evening break times to discuss "Carrying the Revolution Through to the End," "Critiquing War Criminals Seeking Peace," "Chairman Mao's Statement on the Current Situation," and the Chinese Communist Party's urban policies, led by employees with higher political and cultural levels. Workers who were previously illiterate are particularly enthusiastic about learning, reading newspapers and magazines or preparing for the day's lessons whenever they have a spare moment. The preparatory committee of the bureau's trade union is working hard to purchase books and newspapers for them and to reprint various policy documents. The staff in various departments are also eager to keep up, having successively established three hundred and thirteen study groups, each with five to ten people, spending their spare time studying revolutionary theoretical books to establish the ideology of serving the people. The employees have also produced many wall newspapers, such as the workers' "Locomotive," the trade union's "Employee Wall Newspaper," the printing house's "Learning Wall Newspaper," and the women's association's "Women's Wall Newspaper." These wall newspapers publish many articles by employees, and sometimes also include their opinions on the current situation and suggestions for the work of the railway administration.

　　平津铁路管理局职工
    政治文化学习并进
    【本报讯】平津铁路管理局职工热烈学习政治、文化、技术。该局二百多个工人，在二月二十五日就自动成立了职工学校，分成高级、中级、初级、识字班等四个组，学习政治、国文、铁路常识、算术、珠算等功课。还设立了一个无线电专修班，专门学习技术。他们每天利用中午和晚间的休息时间，由政治文化水平高的职工领导，研讨“将革命进行到底”、“评战犯求和”、“毛主席关于时局的声明”及中国共产党的城市政策等。过去不识字的工人，学习更是热烈，有一点空就翻读报纸、刊物，或准备着当天的功课。该局职工会筹备会正努力为他们搜购书报，增印各种政策文件。各处室的职员们也不甘落后，先后成立了三百一十三个学习小组，每组有五人至十人，每天抽空学习革命理论书籍树立为人民服务的思也想。职工们还办了许多壁报，例如工人们的“火车头”，职工会的“职工壁报”，印刷所的“学习壁报”，妇女会的“妇女壁报”等。在这些壁报上，刊登了许多职工们的文章，有时还登载了他们关于时局的意见和对于铁路局工作的建设等。
