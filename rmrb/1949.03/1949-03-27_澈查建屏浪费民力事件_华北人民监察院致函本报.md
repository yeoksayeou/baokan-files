　　Investigation of the Jianping Waste of Public Labor Incident
  　North China People's Supervisory Institute Sends Letter to This Newspaper
    [Our Newspaper] Following the publication by this newspaper of articles regarding Jianping County's waste of public labor, the North China People's Supervisory Institute has sent a letter to this newspaper, stating that it will thoroughly investigate the matter. The original letter is as follows:
    People's Daily Editorial Department: Your newspaper's publication of the news in the "Criticism and Suggestions" column on the 19th of this month, exposing the phenomenon of Jianping County harming the interests of the people, is excellent. After studying this matter, our institute believes that such bureaucratic phenomena as seen in Jianping County are not unique within our region. In order to rectify the political atmosphere, we have decided to thoroughly investigate this incident. The report from Zhang Ziliang of the Fourth Sub-district Armed Forces Department of Beiyue, as published by your newspaper, stated that on the 11th day of the twelfth lunar month last year, the county's Armed Forces Department mobilized 370 good donkeys, 17 mules, and 405 laborers. They arrived at the Third Grain Depot of Jianping County at 8:00 AM, but by nightfall, no one had distributed fodder. The people and animals had no choice but to return home. Afterward, the warehouse accountant, Luo Rufeng, even said: "We estimated that although it was stipulated that transportation would begin on the 11th, the labor force wouldn't arrive until the 12th. We were busy and didn't have time to distribute fodder. Let's take this as a learning experience." This demonstrates that the responsible comrades of the warehouse lack a spirit of responsibility towards the people and are unwilling to make a candid self-criticism. Secondly, according to the Jianping County Committee's reply to your newspaper: the original plan was to transport 53,000 catties of straw in three days, but the Armed Forces Department mobilized 1,196 laborers on the 11th, enough to transport 71,100 catties, which also constitutes a waste of labor. This demonstrates a lack of seriousness and responsibility in the use of the labor of the masses; this kind of bad bureaucratic work style must be eliminated from the people's government. However, the reports from Zhang Ziliang and the Jianping County Committee show very different views on the issue of responsibility, and the true facts of the incident still need to be thoroughly investigated. In addition to instructing the Jianping County Government to truthfully investigate and report the situation, we also request that your newspaper continue to provide various materials and publish this letter.

　　澈查建屏浪费民力事件
  　华北人民监察院致函本报
    【本报讯】本报发表建屏县浪费民力等稿后，华北人民监察院顷致函本报，谓对此将予澈查。其原信如下：
    人民日报社编辑部：贵报本月十九日批评与建议栏内，公布建屏县浪费一千余劳力的消息，揭发了该县违害人民利益的现象是很好的。本院据此研究后，认为类似建屏县这种官僚主义的现象，在我区尚不是绝无仅有，为了整肃政风，决定对此事件加以澈查。贵报揭载之北狱四分区武装部张子良反映，去年旧历十二月十一号该县武装部动员好毛驴三百七十头，骡子十七头，人力四百零五个，上午八时到达建屏县第三粮库，直到天黑尚无人发草，人畜只好返家。事后该仓库会计罗如峰竟说：“我们估计虽然规定十一号起运，十二号劳力也来不了，我们又忙，顾不上发草。这回作为一次经验教训吧。”表现该仓库负责同志毫无对人民负责精神，更不愿进行坦白的检讨。其次根据建屏县委会对贵社之复信中反映：原订三日共运谷草五万三千斤，而武装部十一号竟动员了一千一百九十六个劳力可运七万一千一百斤，亦属浪费劳力，对使用群众劳力表现了不严肃不负责；此种恶劣的官僚主义作风，必须从人民政权中加以肃清。但在张子良的反映与建屏县委会的反映中表现了对责任问题的看法很不一致，事件真象仍须澈查。本院除责成建屏县府据实调查据报外。特请贵报继续供给各种材料并将此函公布为盼。
    　　　　　　　　　　　　　华北人民监察院　　三月二十二日
