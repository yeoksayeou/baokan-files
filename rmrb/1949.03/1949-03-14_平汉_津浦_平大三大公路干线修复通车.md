Xinhua News Agency, Beiping, March 11th: The three major highway trunk lines north of the Yellow River, the Pinghan, Jinpu, and Pingda (name) lines, each over 1,200 miles long, have now been fully repaired and opened to traffic. The North China Highway Bureau has specially selected 20 experienced engineers today to form an engineering team departing from Beiping to survey the lines and prepare to build two additional traffic trunk lines. During the construction of these three major highway trunk lines, the broad masses of peasants in the rural areas along the lines, under the leadership of the local people's governments, actively assisted the employees of the North China Highway Bureau in road construction. They contributed labor, straw, stone rollers, hoes, and shovels without pay, making the roads as smooth as threshing grounds.

　　During the construction of the 80-plus-meter-long Nanguantao Wei River pontoon bridge on the Pingda highway line, the Jinnan First Special District Office mobilized the nearby peasants, workers, the Wei River Conservancy Bureau, and the construction departments of Linqing and Guantao counties and cities to conduct joint research in advance. This successfully overcame various difficulties such as the rapid water flow, the curved riverbank, and the initially imagined problems of materials, boats, and technology. The entire project was completed in three days. During the construction, the Wei River Shipping Company automatically provided fourteen boats and over thirty boatmen. Their enthusiasm was particularly high. Braving the heavy snowfall, they worked tirelessly for three days and three nights, using discarded rails and sleepers found nearby to carry out the construction work, fully demonstrating the high degree of enthusiasm and creativity of the working people.

　　When the Pinghan highway was being repaired to the Zhang River Bridge, only twenty-odd miles away from the Kuomintang army in Anyang, nearby villagers also automatically contributed a large number of sacks. The road workers braved sub-zero temperatures and jumped into the icy water to build bridge piers, thus overcoming difficulties such as the wide and rapid river and the stony riverbed that made it difficult to drive piles. As a result, this 60-meter-long Zhang River Bridge was completed and opened to traffic in just ten days.

　　平汉　津浦　平大三大公路干线修复通车
    【新华社北平十一日电】黄河北岸各长一千二百余里的平汉、津浦、平大（名）三大公路干线，现已全部修复通车。华北公路总局特于今日选派廿个富有经验的工程师，组成工程队自平出发，分赴各线勘查，并准备增建两条通车干线。这次在修筑三大公路干线的工程中，沿线农村的广大农民，在当地人民政府的领导下，曾积极地协助了华北公路总局的员工们修路。他们不要报酬地贡献出人力、秸料和石碾、镐、锹等工具，把公路修得象打粮食场一样的光。
    在修筑平大公路线上八十多米长的南馆陶卫河浮桥时，由于冀南一专署在事先发动了附近农民、工人及卫河河务局，临清、馆陶等县市的建设科共同的进行了研究，致顺利地克服了水流湍急，河岸弯曲及修建前想象中的材料、船只、技术等种种困难，在三天之内，全部修竣。修筑中，卫河航业公会自动的出了十四只船，卅多个船公。他们的情绪特别高涨，冒着纷飞的大雪片，在三天三夜中不眠不休地用丢散在附近的铁轨、枕木从事修建工作，充分地发挥了劳动人民的高度积极性和创造性。
    当平汉公路修至距安阳国民党军仅二十余里的漳河大桥时，附近村民也曾自动献出大批麻袋；路工们更是冒着零下的寒气，奋不顾身地跳到冰水里去搭桥墩，因而战胜了河宽水急及不易打桩的石质河底等困难，使这座六十米长的漳河大桥，仅在十天内即告完成通车。
