　　Quarry Workers Donate Air Conditioning Pipes
    [This newspaper's dispatch] Workers at the Anxinzhuang Quarry of the Public Works Bureau in the western suburbs of Ping City, recognizing that developing production is their glorious task, have donated two air conditioning pipes that they had preserved for a long time to the public. These two air conditioning pipes, fifteen feet long and five inches in diameter, were discovered by them last year on the tenth day of the tenth month of the lunar calendar while quarrying at the southern slope of Xinzhuang Village. At that time, they worked hard for two days to dig them out, secretly hid them, and kept them until now. Recently, after seeing in the newspaper that many workers were donating equipment, everyone discussed it, some saying, "This belongs to the public, and it is right to hand it over to the public for use." Others said, "These pipes were left behind by the Japanese devils, and it would be good to put explosives in these air conditioning pipes to blast rocks. Today the factory is our own, and for the good of the factory, we are willing to donate them." After a heated discussion, everyone unanimously agreed to donate them.

　　采石厂工人献出冷气管
    【本报讯】平市西郊安心庄工务局采石厂工人，认清了发展生产是自己的光荣任务，把保存了很久的两根冷气管献给公家。这两根冷气管，十五尺长，五寸粗，是去年十月初十他们在辛庄村南山坡下采石时发现的。当时辛辛苦苦挖了两天，才挖出来，偷偷地把它藏起，一直保存到现在。最近看到报上很多工人献出器材，于是大家讨论着，有的说：“这是公家的东西，交给公家用是对的。”有的说“这管子是日本鬼子丢下来的，用这冷气管子放上炸药＠石头很好。今天厂子是我们自己的，为了厂子好，我们心愿把它献出来。”经过大家热烈讨论，一致同意献出。
