(Jinzhong Telegram) In order to reduce the burden on the people and livestock in Wutai County's Eighth District, a service cooperative has been established. The cooperative is located in Shizui Town and serves as the central hub for six service stations: Baitou'an, Liu Ding Temple, Brick Temple, Hengling, Longquanguan, and Shentangpu. The round trip distance to each station is approximately eighty li. The cooperative was originally established in 1947, at which time each person obligated to perform service contributed 30,000 border currency as share capital. However, it could not be sustained at that time due to a lack of production subsidies. After merging with the District Joint Cooperative in January of last year, the District Joint Cooperative used profits from production to subsidize the service cooperative's expenses, thus consolidating the service cooperative. Before the establishment of the cooperative, the twenty-five administrative villages only had twenty-two mules and donkeys. Since the establishment of the cooperative, the burden on the people has been reduced, and the number of mules and donkeys has increased to one hundred and twenty. Six hundred and ten people from the twenty-five villages are required to perform service at the stations. Because the service cooperative has two mules, seven donkeys, and five grooms specifically for errands, villagers are only required to provide labor after the cooperative's manpower and livestock have been fully utilized in daily service. The general method of transporting goods through the stations is: injured soldiers who can ride are transported by donkey, goods are transported by carts and livestock, and a few stretchers are carried by two donkeys. According to statistics, last year alone, the Shizui Town service cooperative substituted the people's labor with 2,327 animal labor days and 1,332 human labor days. Because the service cooperative's burden was heavy, it received 21,800 jin of rice in subsidies last year, entirely subsidized by the District Joint Cooperative's production profits.

　　五台县八区
  　设立勤务社
    【晋中电】五台县八区为节省群众人畜力负担，特设立勤务社。该社设于石咀镇，是通白头庵、刘定寺、砖庙、横岭、龙泉关、神堂堡六个勤务站的中心。通达各站的路程往返均在八十里左右。该社早在一九四七年便已成立，那时每个应服勤的人入边币三万元作股金，当时因无生产补助开支，无法支持。去年一月与区联社合并后，由区联社生产中获利补助勤务社开支，这样便使勤务社巩固起来。该社成立前，二十五个行政村仅有骡、驴二十二头，自勤务社成立后，减轻了群众负担，已增加到骡、驴一百二十头，二十五村应上站服勤的人是六百一十名。由于勤务社内有专门听差的骡子二头、毛驴七头、马夫五人，因此，在日常服勤的情况下，除非勤务社的人畜力走完后，不向村里再要差。一般过站的运输办法是：能骑牲口的伤员以驴送，转运东西，使用车与牲口，如遇少数担架则以两条驴驮。据统计：去年全年仅石咀镇勤务社即代替群众负担畜力二千三百二十七个工，人力一千三百三十二个。因为勤务社负担繁重，去年全年贴米二万一千八百斤，完全由区联社生产盈利中贴补。
