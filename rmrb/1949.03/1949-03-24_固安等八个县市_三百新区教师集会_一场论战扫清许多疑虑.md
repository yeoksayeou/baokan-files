　　Gu'an and Other Eight Counties and Cities
    Three Hundred New District Teachers Gather
    A Debate Clears Many Doubts
    [Hebei-Central News] In order to improve education work in the new district, the Tenth Administrative Office of Hebei-Central District held a symposium for teachers of higher primary schools and above in the new district north of the Daqing River, from February 3rd to 22nd. Three hundred and six teachers from eight counties and cities including Shengfang City, Jinwu, Anci, Daxing, Zhuoliangwan, Xincheng, Dingxin, and Gu'an, as well as fifty-six students from the joint normal school attended. Because most of these teachers had suffered from long-term enemy rule and deception in the past, they did not have a good understanding of the various policies of the democratic government. After receiving the meeting notice, some thought: "I've been enjoying myself all this time, this time I must grind the mill, pick up firewood, and run to exercise." Some thought: "I must investigate things when I go, say as little as possible, and don't cause trouble." Some disguised themselves and wore short clothes, and dared not ride their bicycles. After the teachers arrived at the meeting, they saw the lives, speeches, and attitudes of the cadres and the democratic spirit of the conference, and began to change their past perceptions; but some were still thinking: "I'm afraid they won't always treat us so well..." At the beginning of the symposium, Commissioner Song Zhiyi and CCP Tenth District Committee Secretary Zhang Zishan spoke about the policies of the Communist Party and the democratic government, welcoming everyone to eliminate all concerns and boldly raise questions. In view of their ideological situation, Xu Ying, Deputy Secretary of the Tenth District Committee, reported on the international and domestic situation, and Liu Hao, Deputy Commissioner, reported on issues of land reform. A major debate was also held. Everyone unanimously realized that they had been poisoned by the Kuomintang's reactionary propaganda, cleared up many confused ideas about the understanding of the situation and policies, and unanimously expressed their determination to transform themselves and serve the people well. As the symposium drew to a close, everyone's enthusiasm grew higher and higher. In the group meetings, they scrambled to exchange work plans and posted articles on the wall newspapers, expressing their personal thoughts and opinions. At the closing meeting, they enthusiastically answered the hopes placed on them: "Go back and start school first, and use work achievements to evaluate ourselves."

　　固安等八个县市
    三百新区教师集会
    一场论战扫清许多疑虑
    【冀中讯】冀中十专署为提高新区教育工作，从二月三日到廿二日，由教育科召开了大清河北新区高小以上的教师座谈会。到胜芳市、津武、安次、大兴、涿良宛、新城、定新、固安等八个县市的三百零六名教师和联合师范学生五十六人。因为这些教师过去大部遭受着敌人长期统治和欺骗，对民主政府各种政策还不大了解。接到开会的通知后，有的想到：“过去净享受了，这回一定推磨、拾柴、跑步，锻炼锻炼吧。”有的就想：“去了一定要考察事情，少说为佳，别惹出漏子来。”有的化了装，穿上一身短衣服，有自行车不敢骑来。教师们到会之后，看到干部们的生活、言论、态度和大会民主的精神，开始转变着过去的认识；但有的还在想：“恐怕不能老待咱们这么好吧……”座谈会开始时专员宋志毅和中共十地委书记张子善讲了共产党和民主政府的政策，欢迎大家消除一切顾虑，大胆提出问题。又针对着他们的思想情况，由十地委副书记徐英报告了国际国内形势，副专员刘浩报告了土地改革诸问题。并举行了一次大论战，大家一致认识到过去受了国民党反动宣传的毒害，清除了在形势与政策认识上的许多糊涂观念，一致表示决心改造自己，好好为人民服务。在座谈会接近结束时，大家的情绪越来越高涨，小组会上争先交换工作计划，并纷纷在墙报上投稿，发表个人的感想和意见。在闭幕会上，他们热情地回答了对他们的希望：“回去先开学，拿工作成绩来评定自己。”
