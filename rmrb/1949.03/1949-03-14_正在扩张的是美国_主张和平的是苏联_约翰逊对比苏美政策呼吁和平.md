　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, March 12th: TASS, London: The Archbishop of Canterbury, Johnson, delivered a speech at a gathering organized by the British-Soviet Association in Clapham (London) on March 8th, comparing the Soviet Union's advocated peaceful policies with the U.S. ruling group's advocated warmongering policies. Johnson emphatically pointed out that the majority of the American people long for peace, but the American government threatens peace with war. He said: The foundation of the Soviet Union's Five-Year Plan is peaceful construction. But the efforts behind the American economy are war or war preparations. He also emphasized that the Soviet Union has no desire for expansion; it is the United States that has already expanded, with air bases around the Soviet Union all over the world. It is the United States that is expanding, saying it will have the world's largest army, navy, and air force.

　　Johnson declared that Stalin's proposal for peace talks should have been accepted as the basis for negotiations. The East and the West must reach an agreement.

　　Johnson ended his speech amid cheers. He said: "The people of the whole world long for peace. Let us see the success of a peaceful resolution!"

    约翰逊对比苏美政策呼吁和平
    【新华社陕北十二日电】塔斯社伦敦讯：英国坎特伯雷大主教约翰逊于三月八日在英苏协会组织的克拉法姆（伦敦）集会上发表演说，将苏联主张的和平政策与美国统治集团主张的好战政策作一对比。约翰逊着重指出：美国大多数人民渴望和平，但是美国政府却以战争来威胁和平。他说：苏联五年计划的基础是和平建设。但在美国经济背后进行的努力却是战争或备战。他还强调指出：苏联并无扩张欲望，已经扩张的是美国，它在全世界有着环绕苏联的空军基地。正在扩张的是美国，它说它将拥有全世界最大的陆、海、空军。
    约翰逊宣称：斯大林的和平谈判建议，本来应当被接受作为谈判的基础的。东方与西方必须达成协议。
    约翰逊在欢呼中结束他的演说。他说：“全世界人民渴望和平。让我们看到和平解决的成功吧！”
