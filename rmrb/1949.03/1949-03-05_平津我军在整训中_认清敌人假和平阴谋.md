　　Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, March 3rd: During the rectification process, commanders and fighters of the People's Liberation Army in the Pingjin area have further clarified their understanding of the Kuomintang reactionaries' conspiracy to use the guise of "peace" to conceal their war preparations, based on recalling past events. Li Guisheng, a veteran of the three-year Northeast Liberation War from a certain unit, recounted the situation in 1946, saying: "At that time, the Kuomintang reactionaries shouted for peace on one hand and attacked on the other. In order to safeguard the overall situation, we painfully retreated from Shanhaiguan to the Songhua River. This time, they released an atmosphere of peace, intending to catch their breath and launch a counter-offensive, but we will not be fooled." A cadre opened up the diary of Qin Fengyi, the commander of the 272nd Regiment of the 91st Division of the enemy's 71st Army, which was seized in the Battle of Heilinzi, and showed it to everyone. The diary wrote: "The executive group is here. Both sides are arguing over who should be responsible for starting the war. In fact, we (referring to the Kuomintang army) attacked first, so of course the Communist Party will not agree!" Zhu Zhankui, a guard who was ambushed by the Kuomintang army and bandits during the period of the Kuomintang-Communist negotiations in 1946 and almost lost his life, said angrily: "Old debts cannot be ignored! When the reactionaries have power, they want our lives. When they can't win, they want 'peace.' There is no such cheap thing! If you want peace, you can only implement Chairman Mao's eight articles. The most important thing is to hand over their lifeline—the reactionary army. Otherwise, we will be letting down the tens of thousands of fallen martyrs." Many newly liberated soldiers, recalling the tragic scenes of being conscripted into the army in the past, cried sadly on one hand and rejoiced on the other that they had joined the People's Liberation Army and gained the opportunity for revenge.

　　平津我军在整训中
  　认清敌人假和平阴谋
    【新华社北平三日电】正在整训中的平津地区解放军指战员们，在回忆过去的事实时对于国民党反动派用“和平”幌子掩护战争准备的阴谋，更进一步地认识清楚了。某部一位曾参加过三年东北解放战争的老战士李贵生，追叙一九四六年的情况说：“那时国民党反动派一面喊和平，一面进攻。我们为顾全大局，忍痛从山海关退到松花江。这回他们又放出了和平空气，打算喘口气，再来个反冲锋，可是我们不会上当了。”一位干部翻开在黑林子战斗中缴获的敌七十一军九十一师二七二团团长秦凤仪的日记给大家看，日记里面写着：“执行小组来了，双方都争执着谁应负发动战争的责任，事实上先进攻的是我们（指国民党军），当然共产党不会答应！”一位在一九四六年国共和谈期中被国民党军和胡子兵夹击、几乎牺牲性命的警卫员朱占奎气愤地说：“旧帐不能不算！反动派有力量了，就要我们的命，打不过了，就要‘和平’，那有这样便宜的事！要和平就只有实行毛主席的八条，最要紧的是把他们的命根子——反动军队交出来，否则，我们就对不起成千成万的死难烈士。”许多新解放战士想起过去被抓去当兵的悲惨情景，一面伤心痛哭，一面庆幸自己参加了解放军，获得了报仇的机会。
