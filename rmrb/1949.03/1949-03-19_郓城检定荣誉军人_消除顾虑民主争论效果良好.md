　　Yuncheng Reviews Honored Servicemen
　　Eliminating Concerns and Democratic Discussions Yield Good Results

　　[Reported by this newspaper] In order to unify the preferential treatment and pensions for honored servicemen from the former Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu and Jin-Cha-Ji areas and to reduce the financial burden on the people, the North China People's Government decided to conduct a review of honored servicemen. Yuncheng, Ji-Lu-Yu, has gained initial experience in the work of reviewing honored servicemen. (1) First of all, it is necessary to raise the political awareness of honored servicemen and eliminate ideological obstacles. Because honored servicemen in Yuncheng County suffered persecution during the self-defense war, and the government did not provide enough care, this caused dissatisfaction among them. In addition, a few honored servicemen had "meritorious service" thoughts, so they held resistance to the review of their grades. Based on this situation, the county first conducted self-criticism to explain the government's attitude towards honored servicemen in the future; secondly, it repeatedly explained the importance of re-determining the grades, and proposed that honored servicemen should always maintain the glory and fine tradition of revolutionary soldiers, and become models for implementing government decrees. It was also explained that the grade review must be based on self-reporting and public discussion, taking into account both public and private interests. After several rounds of education, the awareness of honored servicemen was raised, laying the foundation for the review work. (2) Discover and cultivate activists, let them participate in group leadership, and rely on them to unite the vast majority of honored servicemen. Individual backward honored servicemen were also properly dealt with under the education and criticism of the masses. There were originally eighteen first-class servicemen and twenty-two second-class servicemen in the county. After evaluation, twelve were downgraded to third class. After the announcement, one person disagreed, but had no justification to argue. (3) During the review, inspire the masses to engage in democratic debate. In the self-reporting work, an honored serviceman lost the function of several fingers and reported himself as Grade B. However, the masses believed that he could not do heavy work and rated him as Grade A of the second class. The leadership guided the masses to discuss: if he cannot engage in agricultural labor, can he engage in other labor? The masses all thought he could. Finally, it was determined as Grade B of the second class, which became the standard for assessing other disability grades. (4) After the assessment of disability grades is completed, special education should be conducted on the future of honored servicemen, so that they can participate in production well in rural areas, and discuss production experience, help formulate production plans, and lay the foundation for organizing honored servicemen's production in the future.

　　郓城检定荣誉军人
  　消除顾虑民主争论效果良好
    【本报讯】华北人民政府为使原晋冀鲁豫与晋察冀两地荣誉军人优待抚恤准备统一，减轻人民财政负担，决定对荣誉军人进行检定。冀鲁豫郓城在荣誉军人检定工作中已获初步经验。（一）首应提高荣誉军人的政治觉悟，消除思想障碍。由于郓城县在自卫战争中，荣誉军人备受迫害，而政府又照顾不够，引起他们不满，再加上少数荣誉军人的“功臣思想”，故在检定等级中，抱有抵抗情绪。该县根据此种情况，领导上首先进行自我批评，说明今后政府对荣誉军人的态度；其次则反复讲解重定等级的重要性，并提出荣誉军人，应当永远保持革命军人的光荣与优良传统，成为执行政府法令的楷模。并说明检定等级一定要自报公议，公私兼顾。经过几次教育，荣誉军人觉悟提高，打下检定工作的基础。（二）发现和培养积极分子，使之参加小组领导，依靠他们团结广大荣军。对个别落后的荣军，在群众的教育批评下，也得到适当的处理。该县原一等者十八人，二等者二十二人，经过评议后，降为三等者十二人。公布后有一人不同意，但又无道理可讲。（三）在检定中，启发群众民主争论。该县在自报工作中，有一个荣誉军人若干手指失掉作用，自报为乙级。但群众认为不能作重活，评为二等甲级。领导上引导群众讨论：不能从事农业劳动，是否可以从事其他劳动？群众都认为可以。最后确定为二等乙级，而成为评定其他残废等级的标准。（四）残废等级评定结束后，应专门进行荣誉军人的前途教育，使之在农村中好好参加生产，并座谈生产经验，帮助制订生产计划，打下今后组织荣誉军人生产的基础。（进）
