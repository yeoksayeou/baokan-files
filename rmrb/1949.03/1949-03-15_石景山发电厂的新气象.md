　　New Atmosphere at Shijingshan Power Plant
    Zhao Gang
    The Shijingshan Power Plant, famous in North China, was liberated by the People's Liberation Army on December 17th of last year. The plant has over a thousand employees and houses generators No. 3, 4, 5, and 6. It currently generates 35,000 kilowatts of electricity daily, supplying power to over two million people in Beijing's urban and suburban areas.

    On the very day of liberation, the workers received the task of resuming power generation. Workers in the maintenance division, responsible for repairing lines, rushed to repair the line from Shijingshan to Mentougou in a matter of hours. The remaining hundreds of workers were also busily checking the machinery in preparation for power generation. Thanks to the active efforts of the workers, everything was arranged by 17:43 on the same day, and the first power generation after liberation began.

    During the first month of the lunar new year, there was a coal shortage, which almost led to a power outage. However, this difficult problem was solved in less than five days after a coal digging campaign was launched among all the workers. They all pitched in and dug out more than 2,000 tons of coal dust from the coal piles that had been buried in ash and dirt for years and were considered useless. Even 50-year-old engineer Zhang Fuqing participated in this action.

    Under the rule of the Kuomintang reactionaries for many years, the Shijingshan Power Plant suffered from disunity among staff and workers, between staff members, and even among workers, resulting in a situation of no communication and disconnection between superiors and subordinates. Therefore, there was no way to talk about developing production and guaranteeing power generation. After liberation, in order to strengthen unity among employees, give full play to the technical expertise of employees, improve the overall work of the plant, and ensure the completion of the glorious task of power transmission, the old systems of the Kuomintang reactionary rule were abolished, and a factory management committee and meeting systems for each unit were established, without disrupting the original organizational structure of the enterprise. Through various meetings, work was initially carried out in a planned manner. Everyone got together and studied any situations or opinions that arose during work, and the enthusiasm for production increased. People entered the factory before the whistle blew every day, and they didn't want to put down their work even after get off work.

    When asked why they were working so actively now, the workers all replied in unison: "Now we workers are the masters of the factory." Precisely because of this, the workers' enthusiasm for labor has greatly increased.

    Workers Li Fengqi and Zheng Wenhua used to be well-known for being lazy, only doing a little work when the foreman was present and "dragging their feet" when he was not. Now their work attitudes have also completely changed. For example, Zheng Wenhua used to only be able to spin two coal car ball bearings a day, but now he has made eight sets of "gao zheng pan" (one "gao zheng pan" is equivalent to the work of forty ball bearings) in less than a week, increasing efficiency by more than twenty times compared to the past.

    In the past, the civil engineering department needed twenty-four people to repair the coal hopper partition wall for a whole day, but now fifteen people can do it in half a day. In the past, workers often did not give detailed explanations when handing over shifts, causing constant problems with the machines. Now they are very serious when handing over shifts, fearing that unclear explanations will affect power generation. The relationship between engineers and foremen and general workers has also been initially harmonious. Foreman Ma Bingwen used to be unwilling to teach his skills to everyone, but now he not only leads the work, but also teaches everyone how to do it. Foreman Yang Shaoxin patiently helps newly transferred workers explain how coal dust furnaces can save coal and increase evaporation. In addition, in order to protect the machines and pay attention to hygiene, the workers voluntarily cleaned up the ash and dirt that had not been cleaned for many years and wiped the machines that had not been wiped for a long time.

    The active actions of the workers of the Shijingshan Power Plant have ensured the completion of the task of supplying power to the entire city of Beijing. This is very obvious. Under the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang, everyone knew that power outages were frequent, but almost three months after liberation, power outages have not occurred.

　　石景山发电厂的新气象
    赵刚
    驰名华北的石景山发电厂，于去年十二月十七日为人民解放军解放了。该厂拥有员工千余名，设有三、四、五、六号发电机，现在每天能发电三万五千千瓦，能供给北平市内，市郊二百余万人口的用电。
    在解放的当天，职工们就接到了复工发电的任务。维护股修理路线的工友们，在短短的数小时内，抢修了石景山至门头沟的线路。其余数百职工也都为检查机器准备发电而紧张的忙碌起来。由于职工们的积极努力，在当天十七点四十三分就安排就绪，并开始了解放后的首次发电。
    正月里曾发生过一次煤荒，几乎有停电的危险。但是这个困难问题，在全体职工中掀起的挖煤运动之后，不到五天的工夫就解决了。他们一齐动手，在数年来被灰土埋着被认为无用的烟煤堆里，挖出了二千多吨煤末，这一个行动，连五十多岁的工程师张富庆也参加了。
    石景山发电厂，在国民党反动派数年来的统治下，造成了该厂职员与工人间，职员与职员间，甚而工人与工人间的不团结，形成了互不联系，上下脱节的情况，因此也就根本谈不到发展生产、保证发电等等问题。解放后，为了加强职工间的团结，发挥职工的技术特长，改进全厂工作，保证完成送电的光荣任务，在不打乱原来企业组织机构的原则下，废除了国民党反动派统治时期的旧制度，建立起工厂管理委员会，以及各个单位的会议制度。通过各种会议，初步做到了有计划的进行工作。工作上有些什么情况，意见，大家多碰头多研究，生产情绪提高了，每天不等汽笛响就进了厂，下班还不想丢下工作。
    当你问到他们为什么现在这样积极工作的时候，工友们都不约而同的回答道：“现在我们工人是工厂的主人了。”正因为如此，工友们的劳动热情大大提高了。
    工友李凤岐、郑文华过去是有名的大泡、二泡，领工的在时就作点活，不在时就给他“磨洋工”。现在他们的工作态度也都完全转变过来了。如郑文华，过去每天只能旋两个煤车滚珠，现在不到一星期已做成八个搞正盘（一个搞正盘顶四十个滚珠的工），效率比过去提高了二十多倍。
    土木股过去修煤斗隔墙，二十四个人做一整天，现在十五人半天就做完了。工人过去上下班时，往往不作详细的交代，使机器不断发生毛病。现在交班时很认真，生怕交代不清影响了发电。工程师和领班的与一般工友们的关系也初步融洽了。领班马秉文过去不愿把技术教给大家，现在不但领头干活，并且教大家如何作。领班杨绍鑫耐心帮助新调来工人讲解煤纷炉怎样能省煤，怎样能使蒸发量大等问题。除此之外，工友们为了爱护机器，讲求卫生，自动地把数年来未清理过的灰土清理了，好久未擦过的机器擦得干干净净。
    石景山发电厂职工们的积极行动，保证了完成全北平市送电的任务，这个事情是很显然的，在国民党反动统治下，谁也知道它是经常停电的，但是解放将近三个月了，停电的事还没有发生过。
