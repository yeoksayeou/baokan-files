　　Three Erroneous Arguments on Marriage Issues
    Editor's Note: Since Comrades Yang Yunyu and Tian Xiujuan published some opinions on women's issues in this newspaper on January 20th, some readers have raised their opinions. As the National Women's Congress is being held, we are especially inviting everyone to actively participate in the discussion. This will be beneficial to the development of women's work and enable some unresolved issues to be resolved more correctly.
    On January 28th, this newspaper published the opinions of Comrades Yang Yunyu and Tian Xiujuan on marriage issues, mentioning that: As long as the feelings between both parties deteriorate and they cannot continue to live together, divorce should be approved if either party firmly requests it. This issue has caused a lot of controversy.
    Personally, I strongly agree with the opinions of Comrades Yang and Tian on marriage issues. I believe that this is a part of the anti-feudal struggle. It represents the demands of millions of Chinese men and women. In the old society, so many young men and women suffered because of marriage problems, even to the point of suicide. This was mainly caused by the remnants of feudal society.
    The first issue that caused controversy in marriage issues is: Some poor peasants take half their lives to find a wife. If divorce can be approved as long as one party requests it, it will be unfavorable to poor peasants. In fact, comrades who hold this view have not seen the changes in the rural areas of North China. Generally, poor peasants have already turned themselves around, and their economic and political status has undergone fundamental changes. At the same time, as the class consciousness of the broad masses of women has increased, the idea of "loving the rich and disdaining the poor" is gradually being eliminated. Therefore, as long as they actively engage in production in the future, it will not be difficult to find a wife. It is inconsistent with the reality of the liberated areas to think that poor peasants will not be able to find a wife if marriage is free.
    Secondly, the concern that too much freedom of divorce will cause chaos is also unnecessary, because sexual chaos is precisely due to the lack of freedom of marriage. If men and women are truly combined with affection, then there will be fewer divorces after marriage. The government's advocacy of freedom of marriage is by no means advocating the unrestrained sexual behavior of men and women. Even if a few people misunderstand freedom of marriage and produce sexual chaos or "cup and waterism" for a while, this is a matter of criticism, education, and transformation, and we cannot "abandon eating for fear of choking."
    In addition, whether it guarantees the interests of one party if divorce is approved when one party requests it. I think this is not contradictory to guaranteeing the interests of both parties. If a couple's feelings have deteriorated and they can no longer continue to live together, even if they reluctantly maintain the marital relationship in form, it will only increase the pain of both parties. What is the benefit to both parties?
    Some people have been poisoned too deeply by the old feudal ethics, thinking that divorce is shameful, or for other reasons, such as: being accustomed to parasitic life in the city and unwilling to engage in labor, not wanting to divorce because they cannot be economically independent after divorce; in the countryside, some are unwilling to divorce because they have children or are getting old, and would rather suffer. The fundamental problem is the past economic dependence. Therefore, if men and women want freedom of marriage, women must first seek economic independence, and the issue of freedom of marriage will not be a big problem. In today's North China Liberated Area, women have been allotted the same share of land as men and have laid the foundation for economic independence, but it does not mean that freedom of marriage will be implemented after economic independence is fully achieved. That is still a bigoted claim sacrificing the interests of women.

### 婚姻问题的三种错误论点

　　婚姻问题的三种错误论点
    编者按：自本报一月二十日杨蕴玉、田秀娟二同志发表对妇女问题几个意见后，曾有一些读者提出意见，正值全国妇女代表大会开会之际，特提出请大家踊跃参加讨论，这将有益于妇女工作的开展，并使一些未决问题，得到更正确的解决。
    本报一月二十八日第四版发表了杨蕴玉、田秀娟二同志关于婚姻问题的意见，提到：只要双方感情恶化，不能继续生活时，任何一方坚决提出离婚，即可批准。大家对这一问题曾引起了很大的争论。
    我个人是十分同意杨、田二同志对婚姻问题意见的，我认为，这是反封建斗争整中的一个部份。它代表着中国千百万男女的要求。在旧社会里，多少青年男女为婚姻问题而苦痛，以至自杀，这主要由于封建社会的遗毒所造成。
    在婚姻问题上引起大家争论的第一个问题是：有的贫农半辈子才找个老婆，如果只要一方提出，就可批准离婚，对贫农不利。实际上，有这样意见的同志，没有看到我们华北农村情况的变化，一般贫农都已翻身，经济、政治地位都有了根本的改变，同时由于广大妇女阶级觉悟提高，“嫌贫爱富”的思想正逐渐消除，因此，只要今后积极生产，找老婆是不会再困难了。认为婚姻自由，贫农找不到老婆，这是不合解放区现实情况的。
    其次关于离婚太自由，会造成混乱现象，这种顾虑也是多余的，因为性乱的行为恰恰是由于婚姻不自由。如果男女双方真正是有感情的结合，则结婚后闹离婚的现象就会少了。政府提倡婚姻自由，绝不是主张男女性生活的放任乱为。即使一时有少数人误解婚姻自由，产生性乱或“杯水主义”的现象，这也是一个批评教育改造的问题，不能“因噎废食”。
    另外，如一方提出离婚，就可批准，是否保证了单方面的利益，我认为这同保证双方利益是不矛盾的，假若有一对夫妇，感情已经恶化，已不能再继续生活下去，即使在形式上勉强维持夫妇关系，更会增加双方面的痛苦，对双方有什么好处呢？
    有些人受了封建旧礼教的毒害太深，认为离婚丢人，或者是由于其他种种原因，例如：城市的过惯寄生生活，不愿从事劳动，离婚后自己经济生活不能独立而不愿离，在农村有的因有孩子，或年纪已大，以至宁愿受痛苦不愿离婚。其根本问题，是过去经济上的不能独立。因此男女婚姻要自由，首先要妇女求得经济上的独立，婚姻自由问题，就不是什么大问题了。在今天华北解放区，妇女已分得和男人同样一份土地，已打下经济独立的基础，但也不是说，等于经济完全独立后，再实行婚姻自由。那仍是大男子主义牺牲妇女利益的遁词。
