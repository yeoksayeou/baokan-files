    Xinhua News Agency, Central China, 5th -- Zhang Qi, commander of the Kuomintang army's 282nd Division, Fan Kechang, chief of staff, Li Huaide, commander of the 845th regiment, and Ma Wanchao, deputy commander of the 844th regiment, who revolted in Wuhu, have recently led all officers and soldiers in issuing a telegram to Chairman Mao of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, Commander-in-Chief Zhu of the People's Liberation Army, and the people of the whole country. The telegram stated: "The war criminal clique headed by Chiang Kai-shek is attempting to actively deploy military defense lines in the south of the Yangtze River under the guise of a peace conspiracy to carry out a desperate struggle. We wholeheartedly support the eight peace terms in Chairman Mao's statement of January 14th, and believe that this is the only way to achieve genuine peace in China. We deeply hate the Kuomintang reactionaries' conspiracy to feign peace and actively prepare for war. From now on, we swear to be loyal to the people and serve the revolution under the leadership of Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu and the direct command of the leaders of the Central Plains Military Region, Liu, Chen, and Deng. We will thoroughly implement Chairman Mao's eight terms and strive to achieve genuine peace and liberation throughout the country."
