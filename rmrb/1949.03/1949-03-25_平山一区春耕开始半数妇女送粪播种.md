[Chahar News] The production plan for Ping Shan County was communicated to the villages on March 2nd. According to reports, all the fertilizer needed for both irrigated and dry land in the first district has now been delivered to the fields. During the manure delivery, most of the women aged sixteen and seventeen participated in driving ox carts to deliver manure. Young women around the age of twenty pushing manure in wheelbarrows are already as capable as strong men. This year, each mu of garden land is fertilized with one hundred small wheelbarrows of manure (pen manure), and general irrigated land is fertilized with sixty to eighty wheelbarrows per mu, which is more than in previous years. The manure is also broken up finer than in previous years. The sowing of broad beans has been completely finished, and now they are busy sowing barley. Garlic is currently being planted in the garden plots.
	In addition, due to the early thaw this spring, plowing also started early, and one-half of the women participated in pulling cattle for plowing, sowing, and holding the plow and rake. Last year, the base fertilizer for wheat fields was thin, so green manure is being universally applied this spring, using twenty-five wheelbarrows of green manure per mu of wheat to supplement the insufficient fertilizer. The Ping Shan Production Promotion Society's first district office also burned 40,000 jin of bones into bone fertilizer for farmers to use. Because farmers benefited from its use last year, bone fertilizer is quite popular among farmers in various places. Shui Nian Village ordered 3,000 jin. They reported, "Bone fertilizer is not only highly effective and saves on transportation, but it is also cheaper than other fertilizers." The office is also preparing three big dan of barley seeds to help solve the seed shortage, as well as three large carts, twenty small wheelbarrows, and fifty iron hoes to help farmers with production. With the help of 10,000 jin of millet in water conservancy loans from the Ping Shan Production Promotion Society, five major canals in the first district (Yongsheng, Minsheng, Gοngkai, Xingsheng, Tiancheng) for 500 qing of irrigated land, and three areas of beach land totaling more than 70 qing, have all started repairs to ensure timely water release during the Qingming Festival. This year, the farmers' enthusiasm for building canals is higher than in the past. The Shui Nian Village Water Management Committee collected straw to use for water management, and the farmers enthusiastically delivered it, collecting more than 20,000 jin of straw in one day. Taking advantage of the spring leisure, villages are repairing houses, with piles of stones and adobe bricks stacked next to the foundations of houses collapsed by the two floods.

　　平山一区春耕开始半数妇女送粪播种
    【察哈尔讯】平山县生产计划，三月二日传达到村。据报一区各村水旱地所用肥料，今已全部送到地里。在送肥中，十六、七岁妇女大部参加了赶牛车送肥。二十岁左右的青妇，用土车推粪已经不弱于壮年男子。今年圆子地每亩施粪（圈粪）一百小土车，一般水地每亩施肥六十至八十土车，均比往年不少。粪比往年捣的还碎。扁豆已全部完成了播种，现在忙着播种大麦。园子地正在栽蒜。
    另外，由于今春解冻较早，犁地也早，有二分之一的妇女参加了拉牛耕地播种和扶犁拿耧等活。去年麦田基肥单薄，今春普遍施行奶青，每亩小麦使奶青肥二十五土车，以补肥料不足。平山生产推进社一区办事处，并将四万斤骨头烧成骨肥，供农民使用。由于农民去年使用得利，骨肥颇受各地农民欢迎。水碾村即订三千斤。他们反映说：“骨肥不但效力大，运输省力，而且价钱比别的肥料还便宜。”办事处并准备大麦种籽三大石，帮助解决种籽困难，大小车三辆、小土车二十辆、铁铣五十张，帮助农民生产。在平山生产推进社水利贷粮小米一万斤帮助下，一区大渠五道（永胜、民生、公开、兴盛、天成）五百顷水地和滩地三处七十余顷，均已开工整修，不误清明放水。今年农民的建渠情绪，较过去高涨。水埝村水委会收稻草准备治水使用，农民踊跃送出，一天之内即收稻草二万余斤。趁春闲各村正在补修房屋，两冲浸塌的房基旁边，垛上一堆堆的石头和土坯。
