(Taihang Telegram) Representatives of various organizations and groups in the Taihang First Special District of Western Hebei, on behalf of the military and civilians of Western Hebei, once again accuse Zhang Yinwu of his crimes. The indictment lists the historical facts of Zhang's crimes against anti-Japanese military and political personnel during the Anti-Japanese War, and earnestly requests that Zhang Yinwu be given the severe punishment he deserves. The article briefly states: As early as the spring of 1939, when the Japanese invaders were launching large-scale offensives against areas such as western Hebei, central Hebei, and southern Hebei, Zhang immediately rose up and actively cooperated. In April of this year, incidents of brutally murdering anti-Japanese soldiers and civilians occurred continuously. The most important of these: On one occasion, sixteen medics from the Second Independent Battalion of our Eighth Route Army were unreasonably detained by the Second Battalion of Zhang's Second Regiment while passing through Yechuchuan in Neiqiu, and after being severely tortured, they were all buried alive. On August 1 of the same year, Zhang Yinwu surrounded our Zanhuang Eighth Route Army Working Group in the middle of the night, looted all documents and property, and kidnapped and murdered more than ten members of the group. In the same year, nineteen soldiers of our Eighth Route Army, while passing through Motianling in Neiqiu, were stationed there by Zhang's troops, who forcibly detained all nineteen soldiers, disarmed them, and subjected them to severe torture. Except for five people who were thrown into the river, the rest were coerced into leaving the anti-Japanese organization before they could escape. The traitorous face was thus completely exposed. In June of the same year, Zhang again ordered his subordinates to surround our Yuanshi Eighth Route Army Working Group and kill its负责人. The indictment believes that between the winter of 1938 and the spring and summer of 1939, the "Hebei People's Army" under Zhang's command should also be held accountable for the dozens of surprise attacks, encirclements, live burials, captures, killings, and throwing into the river, and other open or assassination incidents in areas such as central Hebei and southern Hebei, including Boye, Guangzong, Renxian, Jingxian, Shenze, Weixian, and Nangong, in an attempt to destroy the Eighth Route Army and anti-Japanese political and civilian organizations that persisted in the guerrilla war in the Hebei Plain. After Zhang single-handedly created countless massacres in central and southern Hebei, he sneaked into western Hebei in the autumn of 1939. At this time, Zhang openly colluded with the enemy and clamored for "saving the country through a tortuous path," boasting that "after eliminating the Communist Party and the Eighth Route Army, we can talk about resisting Japan." He then vigorously implemented his "anti-communist" and "kill-communist" policies in western Hebei; and used every means to actively prevent the Eighth Route Army and all anti-Japanese guerrilla forces in the area from advancing towards the Japanese invaders on the Tianjin-Pukou and Pinghan lines. In the early autumn of 1939, just as the Gui Detachment of our Eighth Route Army was advancing along the mountainous area of Zanhuang west of the Pinghan Road towards the Pinghan Road, Zhang, in order to actively cooperate with the Japanese invaders, personally led more than 3,000 people on August 10 of that year to flank and intercept them. The Third Battalion of the Second Brigade of the Gui Detachment was intercepted by Zhang's troops at Zhongmayu Village, west of Zanhuang. For the sake of the common national interest, the battalion sent personnel to negotiate with Zhang to lift the siege, so as to avoid fratricidal fighting, but Zhang refused to meet them and continued to instigate his troops to attack. The battalion was forced to break through heroically, and all of them were killed by Zhang's troops. At the same time, the Hebei-West Guerrilla Force stationed there was also wiped out. The indictment repeatedly stated: The million people in our district have personally experienced Zhang's cruel trampling. Now that Zhang has fallen into the people's net, we specifically apply to the Ping Municipal People's Government to give Zhang severe punishment, so that the dead can rest in peace in the afterlife, and the living can be relieved of the hatred in their hearts.

　　残害抗日军民血帐
  　张逆荫梧必须偿还
    冀西人民再次要求北平市府给予严惩
    【太行电】冀西的太行一专区各机关团体代表冀西军民，再次控诉张逆荫梧的罪行。控诉书中列举抗日期间张逆残害抗日军政人员的罪恶史实，恳切要求给张逆荫梧以应得的严惩。文中略称：远在一九三九年春季，正值日寇大举向冀西、冀中、冀南等地区进攻之际，张逆即起而积极配合。本年四月间，即连续不断发生残害抗日军民的事件。其最要者：一次为我八路军独立二大队卫生员十六人路经内邱野虎川，突被张逆二团第二大队无理扣留，并严刑拷打后悉数活埋。同年八月一日，张逆荫于深夜将我冀两赞皇八路工作团包围，当将文件财物全部掠去，并将该团十余人悉数绑走害死。同年我八路军战士十九人，行经内邱摩天岭，盘据该为之张逆所部，复将十九人全部强行扣押缴械，严刑拷打，除五人投尸河中者外，其余胁迫脱离抗日组织，方得逃生。汉奸面貌从此毕露无遗。同年六月间，张逆又令其部属包围我元氏八路工作团并杀害其负责人。控诉书中认为在一九三八年冬至三九年春夏之间，张逆所统辖的“河北民军”，在冀中、冀南等地区一手制造的博野、广宗、任县、景县、深泽、威县、南宫等数十起突击，包围和活埋、捕杀、投河等公开或暗杀事件，妄图将坚持河北平原游击战争的八路军及抗日政民组织摧毁的罪恶行为，亦应一并清算。张逆于冀中、冀南等地区一手制造了无数残杀事件后，即于一九三九年秋，该逆大部复窜抵冀西，斯时张贼公然附敌，并叫嚣“曲线救国”，大放“消灭了共产党八路军后再谈抗日”，随即于冀西大肆实施其“讨共”“杀共”政策；并用尽一切办法积极阻止该地区的八路军及一切抗日游击武装向津浦平汉线的日寇进击。一九三九年秋初，正值我八路军桂支队沿平汉路西赞皇一带山地向平汉路挺进之际，张逆为积极配合日寇，于斯年八月十日，亲率三千余人，侧击阻击。桂支队第二大队第三营，当被张逆阻击于赞皇以西中马峪村。该营为民族利益共同对敌计，派员向张逆交涉解围，以免自相残杀，哪料张逆拒不接见，并继续唆使其所率部，施行攻击，该营不得已壮烈突围中，全数被张逆杀害。同时并将我驻防该处之冀西游击队消灭。控诉书中反复申明：我区百万人民，曾身历张贼残酷蹂躏，今张贼已落人民法网，特申请平市人民政府，必须给张逆以严厉惩罚，如此，死者方可冥目于黄泉，生者方解除心头之愤恨。
