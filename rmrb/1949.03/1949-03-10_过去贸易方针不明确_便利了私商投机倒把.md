　　The past trade policies were unclear,
  　facilitating speculation by private merchants
    However, due to the unclear trade policies of the past, and the lack of experience and research in managing the economy in newly liberated areas, several serious deviations of principle emerged: First, some trade organizations held purely profit-seeking views. For example, the trade companies in cities like Xuchang, Luohe, and Kaifeng aimed solely to make money, acquiring large quantities of non-essential goods like toilet paper, which wasted foreign exchange and did not help regulate the market or stabilize prices. Second, there was insufficient understanding and ideological paralysis regarding the speculative nature of private merchants. Some procurement personnel were corrupt in their personal lives, lost their principles, and were won over and deceived by unscrupulous merchants. Third, certain responsible comrades did not diligently carry out work inspections, resulting in many unnecessary and entirely avoidable losses to the public. For example, the city-level trade company, due to a lack of in-depth inspection and supervision by the leadership, allowed sixty-one un-dried oilcloths to be folded together and spontaneously combust, resulting in a loss of one million yuan. Fourth, trade agencies in various regions exhibited serious disorganization and lack of discipline, mainly manifested in the scramble to purchase goods from outside in the Luohe market. They were unwilling to accept the unified procurement management of local industrial and commercial trade agencies, and instead sought to trade with private merchants individually, allowing private merchants to take the opportunity to raise prices. Fifth, in recruiting new cadres, careful examination and separate recruitment were not conducted. The transformation and education of new cadres were also insufficient, leading to the infiltration of certain ruffians and hooligans into public enterprises.

　　过去贸易方针不明确
  　便利了私商投机倒把
    但由于过去贸易方针不明确，及对经营新区经营经济缺乏经验和研究，因此产生了若干带有原则性的严重偏向：一、部分的贸易机构存在单纯的营利观点，如许昌、漯河、开封等市贸易公司单纯以赚钱为目的，收购了大批盘纸等非必需品，既浪费了外汇，而对调剂市场、稳定物价方面，又无所助益；二、对私商的投机性认识不足，思想麻痹，若干采购人员，则生活腐化，丧失立场，被奸商拉拢欺骗；三、某些负责同志未认真地执行工作检查，致公家遭受许多不应有的、完全可以避免的损失，如州市贸易公司因领导上没有进行深入的检查督促，使六十一匹没有干的油布，折在一起而起火自焚，损失达百万元之巨；四、各地贸易机关严重地存在着无组织无纪律的现象，主要表现在漯河市场上的争购外来品，不愿接受当地工商贸易机关的统一采购管理，而各自找私商交易，使私商乘机抬高物价；五、在吸收新干部方面，未能审慎检查，分别录用。对新干部的改造教育也十分不够，致某些兵痞流氓分子，混进了公营企业。
