Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 27th—The Northeast Military Region Headquarters and Political Department of the People's Liberation Army, and the Shenyang Municipal People's Government, etc., have recently held grand gatherings to welcome the officers and soldiers of the "Chongqing" ship uprising. A group of more than 200 officers and soldiers from the uprising of the ship, led by Captain Deng Zhaoxiang and the responsible personnel of the Soldiers' Liberation Committee of the ship, arrived in Shenyang on the morning of the 19th of this month. On the same day, a welcome banquet with more than 300 people was held in a certain place in Shenyang. All naval officers and soldiers were invited to the banquet in neat naval uniforms. During the banquet, Zhou Huan, Deputy Director of the Political Department of the Northeast Military Region, delivered a welcome speech, celebrating the uprising of the cruiser "Chongqing". Captain Deng delivered an impromptu speech, expressing that he would definitely serve the people under the leadership of Chairman Mao in the future. Then, naval officers and soldiers raised their glasses and stood up to celebrate the great victory of the People's Liberation Army and Chairman Mao's health. For a time, the whole venue was filled with joy. The young and enthusiastic sailors, like seeing their relatives, unreservedly crowded around toasting and clinking glasses, talking and laughing heartily, and some even whistled and threw up their naval caps with joy. The officers and soldiers of the "Chongqing" said that this was the most exciting gathering they had had since returning to China.

At 6 p.m., there was an even grander welcome party. At this meeting, Ren Xiuquan, Chief of Staff of the Northeast Military Region, delivered a speech, representing all commanders and fighters of the Northeast People's Liberation Army to express warm welcome and condolences to the naval officers and soldiers of the uprising. Then, he summarized the victorious development of the national people's liberation war and the growth and development of the People's Liberation Army from small to large and from weak to strong. Chief of Staff Ren said: "The Chinese people have a powerful and invincible army, and have begun to build an air force. Now, with the uprising of the officers and soldiers of the 'Chongqing', they will also begin to build their own navy. The Chinese people will surely win the victory of the whole of China. We hope that the comrades of the 'Chongqing' will study hard, transform their thinking, and strive to establish a new Chinese people's maritime defense." Captain Deng Zhaoxiang of the "Chongqing" ship then spoke. He said: "The navy is the property of the country and the people, and should not be a tool for slaughtering the people. This time, we have returned it to the people from the hands of the Kuomintang reactionaries, and we feel infinite excitement and glory to be able to serve the people ourselves. In the future, we are willing to work faithfully for the people under the leadership of Chairman Mao and leaders at all levels. I believe that in the near future, a strong people's navy will definitely be established." Li Tieliang, director of the Soldiers' Liberation Committee of the "Chongqing" ship, severely criticized the Kuomintang reactionary government's crimes of selling out the country and waging civil war at the meeting, and enumerated the corruption of the Kuomintang navy. He firmly stated: He believes that following the path taken by the "Chongqing", there will definitely be more Kuomintang ships and navies joining the people's side. Wang Jiting, a naval officer of the "Chongqing", continued to speak, saying: We naval officers and soldiers lived under the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang, like child brides under the feudal system, suffering all kinds of oppression and pain. We hoped every day to return to our homes and see our parents. Now we have indeed returned. Our mother's family is the liberated area, and our parents are all the people of China. Later, the Northeast People's Theater performed the famous new Ping opera "Nine Pieces of Clothing" to entertain the uprising officers and soldiers, and they did not disperse until late at night.

    【新华社沈阳二十七日电】人民解放军东北军区司令部、政治部及沈阳市人民政府等，近日先后举行盛大集会，欢迎重庆号起义官兵。该舰起义官兵一部二百余人，在舰长邓兆祥及该舰士兵解放委员会负责人员率领下，于本月十九日晨到达沈阳。当天，沈阳某地就有一个三百余人的欢迎宴会，全体海军都穿着整齐的海军服应邀赴宴。席间，东北军区政治部副主任周桓致欢迎词，庆祝重庆号巡洋舰的起义。邓舰长即席答词，表示今后一定在毛主席的领导下，为人民服务。接着海军官兵纷纷举杯起立，庆祝人民解放军的伟大胜利，庆祝毛主席健康，一时全场充满了欢乐的情绪。年青而热情的水兵们，象见到自己的亲人一样，毫无拘束地到处簇拥着向人敬酒、碰杯，纵情地谈笑，有些人甚至快乐得吹起口哨，抛起海军帽。重庆号的官兵们说，这是他们回国以来最兴奋的一次集会。
    下午六时，又有一个更盛大的欢迎晚会。在这个会上，东北军区参谋长任修权致词，代表东北人民解放军全体指挥员、战斗员向起义的海军官兵表示热烈的欢迎和慰问。接着，他综述了全国人民解放战争胜利发展的形势和人民解放军由小到大、由弱到强的生长和发展的经过。任参谋长说：“中国人民拥有强大无敌的陆军，并已开始建设空军，现在随着重庆号官兵的起义，又将开始建设自己的海军。中国人民必将取得全中国的胜利。希望重庆号的同志们，努力学习，改造思想，为建立新中国人民的海上国防而努力。”重庆号舰长邓兆祥继起讲话。他说：“海军是国家和人民的财产，不应是屠杀人民的工具。这次我们把它从国民党反动派手中交还给人民，并使自己能为人民服务，感到无限的兴奋和光荣。今后愿在毛主席暨各级首长领导下，忠实地为人民工作。相信在不久的将来，一定能够建立起一支强大的人民的海军。”重庆舰士兵解放委员会主任李铁良在会上痛斥国民党反动政府卖国内战的罪行，历数国民党海军的腐败情形，他坚决地表示：相信随着重庆号所走的道路，一定会有更多国民党的舰只和海军源源不断地站到人民方面来。继续讲话的有重庆号海军军官王继挺，他说：我们海军官兵，在国民党反动统治下生活，象封建制度下的童养媳一样，受尽了压迫和痛苦。我们天天希望回自己的家，见自己的父母。现存我们果然回来了，我们的娘家就是解放区，我们的父母就是全中国的人民。后由东北人民剧院演出著名的新平剧“九件衣”招待起义官兵，直至深夜始尽欢而散。
