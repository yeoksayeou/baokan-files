　　[Jinzhong Electric] After the Pingding County Lijiazhuang Coal Mine was taken over and reorganized by the democratic government, its output greatly increased. The mine had been exploited before the Kuomintang era, but because the mine's soil was not firm and the equipment was very poor, the roadways were narrow, and it was difficult for workers to haul coal, it could not be mined on a large scale. Since the democratic government took over in July last year, it immediately allocated 192 shi of grain and sent cadres to reorganize it. First, the narrow roadways were leveled, so that workers could carry coal out upright; then, transformation work began. A meeting of all workers was held, education was carried out, the trade union was reformed, various systems were democratically formulated, and wages were rationally assessed according to technical skills. From then on, the workers' enthusiasm for production increased day by day. For example, one coal cutter could supply coal for three carriers, and veteran cutter Xiao Miaolai could supply coal for five carriers. Previously, 83 workers could only produce 41,500 catties of coal per day. After the reorganization, they produced 63,800 catties per day. The water drainage workers also became active, causing the mine water to drop by more than one zhang in a month. At the same time, various raw materials and utensils were saved a lot compared to before. For example, in the past, two boilers burned 7,500 catties of coal per day, requiring 48 catties of oil per month; now, they only burn 6,000 catties of coal per day, using only 23 catties of oil per month. In the past, 60 catties of rice were needed for rope every month, while in October and November of last year, only 64 catties of rice were used. In the past, 30 baskets were used every month, but now only 29 baskets were used in two months.

　　平定理家庄矿煤产大增
    【晋中电】平定县理家庄煤矿，经民主政府接管整顿后，产量大增。该矿在国民前即已开采，但因矿井土质不坚固，设备又很差，行道狭窄，工人拉煤很困难，不能进行大量开采。自去年七月民主政府接管后，立即拨粮一百九十二市石，派干部前往进行整理，首先将狭窄的行道刨平，使工人能直腰担出煤来；接着即着手改造工作，召开了全体工人会议，进行教育，改革了工会，民主制定了各种制度，并按技术好坏合理评定了工资。从此，工人生产情绪逐日提高。如刨头工人一人能供三人担煤，老刨头萧庙来竟能供五人担煤。以前每天八十三个工人仅能产煤四万一千五百斤，整顿后，每天产六万三千八百斤。吸水工人也积极起来，使矿水一个月落下一丈多。同时，各种原料及用具较前节省很多。如过去每天两口锅炉烧七千五百斤炭，一月需油四十八斤；现在每天只烧六千斤炭，每月只用二十三斤油。过去每月用绳需米六十斤，而去年十至十一两个月仅用米六十四斤。过去每月用三十个篓子，现在两个月仅用廿九个。
