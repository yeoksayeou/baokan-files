　　Tangshan Huaxin Textile Mill Female Workers
    Send Off Representatives Attending the Women's Congress
    And Propose Six Suggestions to the Congress
    [Tangshan, 20th Dispatch] The Huaxin Textile Mill in Tangshan elected a representative to attend the First National Women's Congress. Before the representative's departure, the entire factory held a meeting to send her off. Huaxin has more than 1,100 female workers. With incomparable joy and happiness after liberation, they not only instructed the representatives to bring their collective determination to the Congress, telling the Congress that they must work hard to produce and support the front lines, to liberate all of China as soon as possible, but also put forward the following suggestions based on their own needs: 1. In order to facilitate female workers and encourage women to widely participate in the production front, nurseries should be established as much as possible to reduce the burden of raising children outside of work; 2. Factories should establish female worker dormitories; 3. Improve women's culture, establish worker schools and literacy classes; 4. Establish schools for cadres' children and give special care to the families of military martyrs; 5. Remove traditional feudal constraints and achieve equality between men and women and freedom of marriage; 6. Female workers should be given appropriate care in their jobs during the seventh and eighth months of pregnancy.
