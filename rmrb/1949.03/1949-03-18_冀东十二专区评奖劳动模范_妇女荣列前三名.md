    [Jidong Electric] The Twelfth Special District (governing nine counties including Qian'an) convened a labor model conference on February 21st. One hundred and fifty labor models (including sixty women) from various counties and districts, representing production and support for the front, attended. The conference lasted eleven days. After group discussions on the criteria for labor models in the district, self-reporting of model deeds, and group evaluations, each county nominated candidates. Nine district labor models were selected, including Ren Xiurong (female). Six women were honorably selected. When the Twelfth Special Administrative Office's production plan for this year was communicated at the conference, the labor models unanimously supported it and established individual production plans to guarantee completion. The awards were presented on March 3rd, with over 20,000 people from over seventy nearby villages attending. In addition to awarding "Certificates of Merit" to the labor models, the first and second-place labor models, Ren Xiurong and Granny Lan, were each awarded a large donkey and a piece of farm equipment.
