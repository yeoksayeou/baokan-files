　　"I'm Not Falling For It!"
　　Zhang Zupei　Lin Shichai
　　My landlord is really stubborn. I've been in the army for over a year and this is the first time I've met such a difficult fellow villager. I can't borrow anything from him. If the cadres ask me to borrow something, I'd rather walk a few extra steps than even talk to him.

　　My landlord's name is Gao, he's in his twenties, a bit taller than me, dark-skinned, chubby, with shifty eyes that are always darting around. He wears black pants and a jacket, deliberately showing his woolen underwear, and wears a Japanese devil's leather hat. He struts around all day, I don't know what he's busy with. He farms seventy or eighty mu of land, relying solely on the two poor laborers in the east courtyard. He doesn't even look at the livestock he feeds. I've lived here for almost a month, and I haven't said a word to him.

　　One afternoon, I went to ask those two poor laborers in the east courtyard for something and ran into my landlord. He greeted me, and I couldn't ignore him, otherwise, people would criticize me for having bad relationships with the masses.

　　We squatted in the courtyard, and I asked, "Why don't you stay with your dad?"

　　He said, "He's old, a bit crazy, muttering 'Want my life, want my life' all day long. I don't want to argue with him at home."

　　I was a little surprised, so I asked, "What do you do outside all day?"

　　He laughed and said, "Nothing, just goofing off!"

　　Humph, a man in his twenties goofing off all day, truly a good-for-nothing. What's the point of talking to a good-for-nothing? Before I could stand up, he asked, "You came from the army, right?"

　　I thought for a moment and felt that this guy was strange, so I didn't tell him the truth: "I was liberated."

　　"Liberated from where?"

　　"From the south."

　　"Which unit were you in over there?"

　　"Hu Zongnan's troops."

　　"How's life over there?"

　　"Better than here."

　　"They give out more allowances, right?"

　　"Much more."

　　He looked around and then asked, "Do you want to be a soldier?"

　　"Do common people even want to be soldiers!?" I deliberately teased him.

　　"There are a lot of deserters in the army, right?"

　　"Quite a few, but a lot return too."

　　"Do you think deserting is good?"

　　"Sooner or later you have to return, right?"

　　"Take a chance, you might not be able to come back."

　　I moved closer to him and whispered, "I also want to desert, but there's no way, being a messenger I have no money, no belongings, I can't desert even if I want to."

　　He widened his shifty eyes and whispered, "You dare to desert? I'll help you, give you money, give you clothes."

　　Giving money and clothes for nothing, this was the first time I'd encountered that, so I said, "That would be great!"

　　"Where are you from?"

　　"From Zaoqiang County, Hebei."

　　The bugle sounded outside, and he stood up and said, "Go eat dinner first!"

　　I ate dinner in a daze, couldn't sleep well all night, always feeling like something was weighing on my mind.

　　The next day, after dinner, I went to find him. He was standing in the east courtyard, and as soon as he saw me, he said, "Come, come, I want to talk to you, I want to talk to you."

　　I went over, and he asked bluntly, "When are you leaving?"

　　"I'll leave when my fellow villager leaves."

　　"Leave the day after tomorrow!" He then asked, "How much money do you need?"

　　"At least ten thousand yuan, right?"

　　"That's fine, don't we common people have ten or twenty thousand yuan? I have clothes, I'll prepare the money for you."

　　"Prepare everything for me, okay!"

　　He happily said, "Humph, being a common person is much better, much better than being a soldier, look how free I am all day…" Before he finished speaking, he hurriedly urged me, "I'm afraid someone will call you, hurry back!"

　　On the third day, at dusk, as soon as I entered the east courtyard, he came up to me and asked, "Has your fellow villager left?"

　　"No." I said, "Have you prepared the stuff?"

　　"I've got eight or nine thousand yuan, it's not enough, you can't leave today!"

　　I got anxious: "If I can't leave, what do I do?"

　　"Tomorrow you go goof off on the streets, they won't find you at home, go back at mealtime, and no one will notice you, it will be easy to desert."

　　"Okay!"

　　"Where do you want to change clothes?"

　　"Let's change at home!"

　　He quickly shook his head and said, "No way."

　　I said, "There are sentries outside, I don't dare go."

　　"Then tomorrow, when you leave, carry some sorghum flour on your back. Pretend to be a militiaman going home, and no one will ask you on the road."

　　"Make sure it's ready by tomorrow!"

　　After I finished speaking, I walked back, and he kept saying behind me, "Definitely! Definitely!"

　　On the fourth day, a while after dark, I went to the east courtyard. He was sitting in the poor laborer's room. As soon as I went in, he stood up and said, "I want to tell you something!"

　　I followed him outside, and he gave me a big roll of bills, and led me behind the house. He took out a set of commoner's clothes and asked, "Do you have anything else?" I said "No."

　　"Do you have a towel?"

　　"Yes." I said, "I forgot to bring it. I'll go back and get it to cover my head."

　　"Hurry back."

　　He waited behind the house, and I ran back as fast as I could, wishing I could run in one step, my heart was pounding, truly like drums, as soon as I entered the house, several staff officers were talking in the room. I was panting and gasping, everyone turned to look at me, not knowing what was going on. I put the bills on the table and said, "Here's the cash, count the money!"

　　Everyone was stunned. Only Secretary Tian, who I had secretly told, understood as soon as he saw it. He rushed forward and asked, "He gave you money? He gave you money?"

　　Before I could answer, he asked, "Where is that person?"

　　"Waiting for me in the east courtyard!"

　　The others were all completely clueless, staring with wide eyes. Chief of Staff Wu came in and asked, "What's going on?"

　　Secretary Tian said, "Special agent activities, Wang Dengyu is deserting."

　　The Chief of Staff said, "Quick, deploy some people, quick!"

　　I grabbed a towel and ran to the east courtyard. He was still waiting behind the house. He quietly asked, "Did you bring it? Hurry up and change!"

　　I put on the civilian pants, listening to the courtyard, there was no movement at all. I took off my upper body military uniform, still no movement. I put the towel over my head, still no movement. He kept urging me beside me: "Hurry, hurry."

　　I was really anxious. They were only a wall away, why hadn't they come yet? I deliberately dawdled, he got anxious: "Let's go, is there anything else?"

　　"I don't even know the route yet?"

　　"I'll go ask for you."

　　Just as we turned from behind the house, Secretary Tian and the others came in with guns and asked, "What are you doing?!"

　　He walked towards the poor laborer's room while saying, "I'm a fellow villager, I'm a fellow villager."

　　I said from behind, "I'm deserting!"

　　The messenger went up and tied him up, and he immediately understood, and said, "Wang Dengyu, you…"

　　I laughed, "I, I joined the army after emancipation, my two brothers both joined the army, why would I want to desert? I'm not falling for your tricks!"

　　Pah! This son of a bitch, Yan Xishan is about to be buried, and he insists on going with him. We are about to defeat the Kuomintang reactionaries, I will definitely see it through to the end!

　　“俺可不上当！”
    张祖培　林十柴
    俺那房东可顽固啦。俺参军一年多还是头一回遇着这样的老乡，借点啥也不中，干部叫俺借点啥，俺宁肯多跑几步路也不和他多开口。
    俺那房东姓高，二十来岁，比俺略高些，黑黑的，胖胖的，两只大眼睛总贼溜溜地滚来滚去。他穿着黑裤褂，故意把毛衣毛裤露在外面，戴个日本鬼子的皮帽，成天幌来幌去，倒背着手不知他一天价忙个啥？种一顷七八十亩地，光指望东院两个受苦的动弹，连喂的几个牲口他也不望一下。住了快上一个月，俺也没和他说过一句话。
    一天下午，俺到东院那两个受苦的那里去要，遇见俺那房东了，他和俺打招呼，俺可不能不理人，若不，别人又该批评俺群众关系不好啦。
    俺俩圪在院里，俺问：“你怎不朝你爹的面？”
    他说：“上了年纪啦，疯疯癫癫的，一天价‘要命吧、要命吧’的嘟哝。我不愿在家和他呕气。”
    俺有些奇怪，就问：“你成天在外边干啥呢？”
    他笑了，说：“啥也不干，耍罢！”
    哼，二十多岁的人成天价耍，真是个不折不扣的二流子。和二流子谈个啥呢？没等俺站起来，他问：“你是参军出来的吧！”
    俺想了一下，觉得这人很怪，就不给他说实话：“解放过来的。”
    “从哪里解放过来的？”
    “从南边。”
    “你在那边在哪部份？”
    “胡宗南的队伍。”
    “那边生活怎样？”
    “比这好。”
    “发津贴比这多吧！”
    “比这多的多。”
    他往四周看了一下接着又问：“你愿不愿当兵？”
    “老百姓还愿当兵！？”我故意逗他。
    “队伍上开小差的很多吧？”
    “可也不少，归队的也挺多。”
    “你看开小差好不好？”
    “早晚还不是得归队？”
    “碰运气罢，不一准能回来。”
    俺向他凑近一步，小声说：“俺也想开小差，可是没办法，当个通讯员没有钱，也没有东西，想开也没办法。”
    他瞪大了贼溜溜的眼睛，小声问：“你敢开小差？我帮你，给你钱，给你衣裳。”
    平白给钱，又给衣裳，俺可头一回遇着，就说：“那敢情好啦！”
    “你是哪里的？”
    “河北枣强县的。”
    外面吹号了，他就站起来说：“你先吃晚饭去吧！”
    俺稀里糊涂吃了饭，一夜没睡好觉，心里总有点事放不下。
    第二天，吃完晚饭，俺就去找他去啦，他在东院站着，一见俺，就说：“来，来，我跟你说，我跟你说。”
    俺就过去啦，他劈头就问：“你多时走呵？”
    “俺老乡走了俺就走。”
    “赶后天走吧！”他接着又问：“要多少钱呢？”
    “总得一万多块钱吧！”
    “行啦，咱一个老百姓还没有一万两万块钱？衣裳我有，钱给你准备。”
    “给俺都准备好吧！”
    他高兴地说：“哼，当个老百姓多好，比当兵强多了，看我一天多自在……”还没说完，他连忙催俺：“怕有人叫你，快回去吧！”
    第三天黄昏时候，我一进东院，他就迎上来问：“你老乡走了没有？”
    “没有。”俺说：“东西预备好没有？”
    “钱华上八九千块，还不够，今天走不了啦！”
    俺急了：“走不了，怎么搞？”
    “明天你上各街去耍，家里找不着你，到吃饭的时候就回去，就没人留神你，开小差就好开了。”
    “好吧！”
    “在哪里换衣裳呢？”
    “就在家里换吧！”
    他连忙摇头说：“不中。”
    俺说：“外头有站岗的，俺可不敢去。”
    “那么明天你走时背上点高米面。装民兵就回去啦，路上保险没人问。”
    “赶明天可准备好呵！”
    俺说完往回走，他在后面连说：“一定！一定！”
    第四天，天黑一大会子，俺到东院去，他在受苦的那屋坐着，俺一进去，他就站起来说：“我跟你说点事！”
    跟他到外面，他就给俺一大卷票子，把俺领到房子后面。拿出一套老百姓衣裳，他问：“你还有啥东西没有？”俺说“没有。”
    “有毛巾没有？”
    “有。”俺说：“忘带来啦。俺回去取来好蒙头。”
    “快去快回。”
    他在房后等着，俺一溜烟往回跑，恨不得一步跑到，心砰砰的跳，真象打鼓似地，一进屋，几个参谋都在屋里说话呢，俺上气不接下气，呼呼直喘，别人都扭过头来看俺，不知啥事，俺把票子往桌上一放，说：“办现的，数票子吧！”
    大家一怔。只有田书记俺悄悄告过他，他一看就明白了。忙抢上前问：“他给你钱啦？他给你钱啦？”
    没等俺回话，又问：“那个人在哪里呢？”
    “在东院等俺呢！”
    别人都是丈六的金刚摸不着头脑，瞪着眼睛看，武参谋长进来问：“干啥？”
    田书记说：“特务活动王登禹开小差。”
    参谋长说：“快布置几个人，快！”
    俺拿一条毛巾就跑东院去转，他还在房后等俺。他悄声问：“拿来啦，赶快换吧！”
    俺把便裤套上，耳朵听着院里，一点动静也没有，又把上身军装换下来，还没动静，又把毛巾蒙到头上，还没动静。他在旁边直催：“快些，快些。”
    俺可真急了。隔一道墙，他们怎还不来呀。俺故意磨磨蹭蹭，他急了：“快走吧，还有啥事么？”
    “俺还不知道路线呢？”
    “我给你问问去。”
    俺俩刚从房后转过来，田书记他们拿着枪进来了，问：“干什么的？！”
    他往受苦的屋子里边走边说：“我是老乡，我是老乡。”
    俺在后面就说：“俺是开小差的！”
    通讯员上去把他绑住了，他马上就明白了，忙说：“王登禹，你……”
    俺笑了：“俺，俺翻了身才参军，俺两个哥都参了军，俺为啥要开小差？可不上你的当！”
    呸！这狗日的，阎锡山眼看要入土了，他偏偏要去陪葬。俺们快要打倒国民党反动派了，俺一定干到底！
