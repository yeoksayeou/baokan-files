　　Fake Smallpox Vaccine Harmful; Please Note Prior Review in Various Regions
To the Editor:
    I have two suggestions: First, as the cold departs and spring arrives, the climate gradually warms, and people habitually vaccinate their infants against smallpox during this period. Moreover, seeing reports in the newspapers recently about the prevalence of smallpox, it is estimated that this year the number of people vaccinated against smallpox will not be limited to children; adults will certainly be vaccinated as well. Therefore, the smallpox vaccine should be strictly reviewed. Last year, we purchased a dozen vials of smallpox vaccine on behalf of others at the Yangquan City Wanzhong Hospital. The hospital claimed it was an effective vaccine, but when doctors vaccinated the children, only six or seven out of ten developed any reaction at all, or none at all. Only then did we realize that the vaccine had expired. Later, we bought another dozen vials at the Pinding County Cooperative and revaccinated the children who had not developed pustules, and they all developed blisters, produced pus, and scabbed over. This proved that the vaccine purchased at Wanzhong Hospital was expired. Later, to truthfully understand the quality of Wanzhong Hospital's vaccine, we had Comrade Wu of the Municipal Complete Primary School vaccinate his child at the hospital twice, and no blisters developed either time. This is a matter related to the lives of millions of infants; therefore, I suggest that local governments should organize a smallpox vaccine review committee, with state-owned stores or public hospitals responsible for distributing the vaccine to doctors in various regions. An order should be issued prohibiting the sale of fake smallpox vaccine, and local bureaus of industry and commerce and public hospitals should be responsible for inspecting vendors. Those found to be selling fake goods should be severely punished according to law.
    Second, after the Handan City government dealt with the fake drug merchant, I believe that the Handan Municipal Government's action is very admirable and respectable. This is a concrete manifestation of concern for the people's suffering. Handan is one of the distribution centers for medicinal materials, and it is not only possible but even inevitable that fake drugs will spread to various regions. I suggest that the government issue an order to organize doctors in various regions (with public hospitals as the core) to carefully inspect the medicines in various traditional Chinese and Western medicine shops, especially the medicines sold by itinerant merchants in the countryside. Epidemics often occur in the spring and summer. If fake drugs are allowed to exist and poison the people, they will bury the lives of many patients.
                                                                                                (Li Dasan, Li Yue)

### 假牛痘浆害人不浅　请各地注意事前审查

专栏：批评与建议

　　假牛痘浆害人不浅　请各地注意事前审查编辑同志：
    我有两点建议：一、寒去春来，气候渐暖，老百姓习惯上要在这个时期给自己的婴孩种牛痘，又看到报纸上，近来也报导了天花流行的消息，估计今年种牛痘的人，不仅限于小孩，成年人也一定种的少不了。所以，对牛痘浆应当严格的审查才好。去年我们在阳泉市万众医院给别人代买了一打牛痘浆，该院声言是有效浆，但当医生给小孩们种上，十有六七出不全或者一颗也不出，这时才知道痘浆已失效了。后来又在平定县联社买了一打，给种上未出痘的孩子们补种，便都发泡生浆，结痂了。这证明在万众医院买的是已失效的痘浆，后来我们为了真实的了解万众医院的痘浆，叫市立完全小学校武同志的孩子在该院连种两次都未发泡。这是一个关系千万婴儿生命的事情，因此，我建议各地政府应组织牛痘浆审查委员会，由国营商店或公立医院负责分销给各地医生，下令禁止买卖假痘浆，并通令各地工商局、公立医院负责检查贩卖者，查出买卖假货者，应依法严惩。
    二、自邯郸市发现假药商，政府处理后，我认为邯郸市政府这一行动非常可钦可敬，这是关心人民疾苦的一种具体表现。邯郸是药材集散地之一，流散各地的假药不但是可能甚至是必然，我建议政府下令组织各地医生（以公立医院为核心），分组仔细检查各中、西医药铺，特别是在乡下卖药的行商的药品。春夏常发生流行病，如让假药存在而荼毒人民，将会葬送许多病人的生命。
