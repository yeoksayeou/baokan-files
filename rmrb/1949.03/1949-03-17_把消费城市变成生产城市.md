　　Transforming Consumer Cities into Production Cities
    With the victorious development of the revolutionary war, we have liberated and will continue to liberate many large cities. This is a major event of historical significance for us! At the same time, it has brought us extremely complex new problems.
    In the past twenty years, our work has been focused on the countryside first, then the city. This was because counter-revolutionary forces were relatively weak in the countryside, making it easier for revolutionary forces to exist and develop. Chairman Mao laid down this correct line, and therefore, during the Soviet movement and the War of Resistance Against Japan, revolutionary base areas were created, a powerful people's revolutionary army was organized, and today's historic great victory was achieved. But now that large cities have transformed from counter-revolutionary fortresses into revolutionary fortresses, belonging forever to the people, the past approach needs to be changed. Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee have instructed us again: we must reverse the practice of the past twenty years and change the approach of countryside first, then city, to city first, then countryside. If we cannot do a good job in urban work, and make the city play a leading role in the countryside, then it will be impossible for the rural areas to have further development, and it will be impossible for China to change from an agricultural country to an industrial country, and the people's revolutionary regime will not be consolidated, and the Chinese people will still not be able to achieve complete liberation.
    How can we do a good job in urban work? How can we make the city play a leading role in the countryside? The central link is to rapidly restore and develop urban production, and transform consumer cities into production cities.
    In old China, a semi-feudal and semi-colonial country, the large cities (like Beiping) where the ruling class resided were mostly consumer cities. Some, though possessing modern industries (like Tianjin), still retained the characteristics of consumer cities. Their existence and prosperity depended entirely on exploiting the countryside, in addition to exploiting the workers as much as possible. Through political and economic exploitation, they not only plundered agricultural products from the countryside to supply their needs, but also sucked the marrow and sweat of rural farmers to exchange for imperialist industrial products. They were generally exploited by imperialism, but exploited the countryside (and similarly, urban workers). Therefore, a state of hostility between the countryside and the cities was created. After we enter the big cities, we must not allow this phenomenon to continue. To eliminate this phenomenon, we must restore and develop production rapidly, in a planned and step-by-step manner. From the first day of entering the big cities, we should strive in this direction. Only in this way can we fully and cheaply supply the countryside with necessary industrial products and exchange them for agricultural products, transforming the relationship between the countryside and the city from mutual hostility to mutual dependence; only in this way can we improve the economic position of the city, thereby improving the lives of the urban people, especially the workers; only in this way can we resist imperialist economic aggression and no longer be exploited by it; only in this way can we enable the city to lead the countryside and transform an agricultural country into an industrial country; only in this way can we consolidate the worker-peasant alliance and consolidate the people's democratic dictatorship led by the proletariat and based on the worker-peasant alliance, from the city to the whole country.
    Restoring and developing urban production is undoubtedly an arduous task for us, but it is by no means impossible. First of all, although the Chinese working class is small in number, it is very strong in quality and mostly concentrated in the cities. As long as we rely on them sincerely and give full play to their strength, the subjective conditions for restoring and developing urban production are in place. Secondly, although modern industry accounts for only about 10 percent of the Chinese national economy, it is mostly concentrated in and around the cities. Among them, the most important and largest scale ones are monopolized by imperialists and their lackey bureaucrat-capitalists. We confiscate them and make them the property of the New Democratic state. As long as we do not disperse or destroy them, and do not make mistakes in operation such as agricultural socialism and lack of discipline and planning, then the objective basis for restoring and developing urban production also exists. Thirdly, although the modern industry operated by private capital in the cities is fragile, it still exists in considerable quantities. As long as we adhere to the policy of protecting industry and commerce, guide them to a direction beneficial to the national economy and the people's livelihood, and allow them to exist and develop within the track of the national economic policy and economic plan, it will also become a powerful factor for the restoration and development of urban production. Finally, scattered and individual handicraft production not only exists in large quantities in the countryside, but also exists considerably in the cities, especially in cities without modern industry (such as Beiping). As long as we give them appropriate support and gradually organize them through production, consumption, credit, and even supply and marketing cooperatives, it will also be of great help to the restoration and development of urban production.
    It can be believed that, whether from a subjective or objective point of view, it is possible to rapidly restore and develop urban production. The question is whether we seize this central link and carry out this important work (some cities have not paid attention to this issue for a month or several months after we entered them, which is wrong), and whether we can follow the correct direction in carrying out this work without major deviations. After we have constantly and severely criticized agricultural socialist ideology and corrected the error of eliminating private industry and commerce, the main deviations that may or have already occurred in restoring and developing urban production today are:
    1. Failure to understand or be good at relying on the working class, uniting other working people, revolutionary intellectuals, and representatives, intellectuals, and democratic parties of the liberal bourgeoisie to jointly devote themselves to the arduous task of building cities and thus building the country. Some do not rely on the workers, but rely on the poor, and are busy all day long distributing grain and lending money to provide relief. Some do not rely on the working class, but rely on the bourgeoisie, believing that the working class has nothing and cannot be relied upon to build cities. This is a right-leaning deviation. Everyone knows that the working class, other working people, and revolutionary intellectuals are the leading and basic forces of the people's democratic dictatorship. If we do not sincerely rely on the working class and earnestly unite other working people and revolutionary intellectuals, the revolutionary forces will become weak, and not only will it be impossible to complete the task of building cities and building the country, but even the people's democratic dictatorship itself will not be consolidated. But on the other hand, indiscriminately kicking the bourgeoisie away completely, and not uniting and cooperating with them, is a left-leaning deviation. This will isolate the revolutionary forces, and similarly, it is harmful to building cities, building the country, and consolidating the people's democratic dictatorship.
    2. Only attaching importance to private enterprises, and neglecting state-owned enterprises; unconditionally and unlimitedly supporting all private capitalism without distinction, and not imposing necessary restrictions on speculative, manipulating, barbaric, and private capitalism that is not conducive to the national economy and the people's livelihood. Of course, today, private capitalism needs to develop. We have firmly established this policy and cannot waver. Therefore, it is also wrong to give it too much inappropriate restriction, causing it to fail to develop or even tend to be eliminated. But because our economy is led by the state-owned sector, all other economic structural components are developing in a direction beneficial to the national economy and the people's livelihood. Therefore, for the speculative, manipulative, barbaric, and private capitalism that is not conducive to the national economy and the people's livelihood, we must impose appropriate and necessary restrictions on all aspects such as the scope of activities, tax policies, market prices, and labor conditions, guiding them to play an active role that is beneficial to the national economy and the people's livelihood, and preventing them from having a negative effect that is not conducive to the national economy and the people's livelihood.
    3. Only knowing how to encourage production, but not having plans or methods for supply and marketing, causing production and consumption to be disconnected, supply and demand to be contradictory, and products to be unable to be sold, which inevitably leads to stagnation in production and gives speculative merchants the opportunity to manipulate and exploit. In order to avoid this malpractice, we must, on the one hand, carry out production as planned as possible, and on the other hand, gradually develop supply and marketing cooperatives under the conditions of need and possibility. This cooperative is a link connecting producers and consumers, that is, a bridge connecting the countryside and the city. It sells industrial products to the countryside at fair prices, and buys agricultural products at fair prices to supply the city. This not only allows the countryside to avoid the intermediate exploitation of speculative merchants and the city to obtain grain and raw materials, but also encourages farmers to produce and develop the rural economy.
    Transforming consumer cities into production cities is our current important task. We must shoulder this task and complete this task. But because we have been separated from the city and transferred to the countryside for a long time, and are extremely unfamiliar with the urban situation and work, to complete this important task, we must learn humbly and work hard!

### 把消费城市变成生产城市

　　把消费城市变成生产城市
    随着革命战争的胜利发展，我们已经解放并将继续解放许多大城市。这对于我们，是一件具有历史意义的重大事件！同时，也给我们带来了极其复杂的新问题。
    过去，二十年来，我们的工作是先乡村后城市。这是因为在乡村，反革命力量比较薄弱，革命力量容易存在和发展的缘故。毛主席规定下了这条正确的路线，因而，在苏维埃运动期间、在抗日战争期间，创造了革命根据地，组织了强大的人民革命的队伍，获得今天历史性的伟大的胜利。但当现在大城市从反革命的堡垒变为革命的堡垒，永远属于人民的时候，过去的做法就需要改变了。毛主席和我党中央又指示我们：必须一反二十年来的做法把先乡村后城市的做法，改变为先城市后乡村的做法。如果我们不能把城市工作做好，使城市起领导乡村的作用，那就不可能使农村有进一步的发展，也就不可能使中国由农业国变为工业国，而人民革命政权就不会巩固，中国人民就还不可能做到彻底翻身。
    怎样才能把城市工作做好？怎样才能使城市起领导乡村的作用？中心环节是迅速恢复和发展城市生产，把消费的城市变成生产的城市。
    在旧中国这个半封建、半殖民地的国家，统治阶级所聚居的大城市（象北平），大都是消费的城市。有些，虽也有着现代化的工业（象天津），但仍具有着消费城市的性质。它们的存在和繁荣除尽量剥削工人外，则完全依靠削剥乡村。它们经过政治的，经济的各种剥削方式，不仅搜括乡村的农产品来供给它们的需要，而且吮吸乡村农民的脂膏血汗去换取帝国主义的工业品。它们对于帝国主义，一般地也是被剥削者，而对于乡村（同样，对于城市工人），则是剥削者。因此，造成了乡村和城市的敌对状态。我们进入大城市后，决不能允许这种现象继续存在。而要消灭这种现象，就必须有计划地、有步骤地、迅速恢复和发展生产。从进入大城市的第一天起，就应向着这个方向去努力。这样，才能够充分而便宜地供给乡村以必要的工业品，而换取其农产品，使乡村和城市，从相互敌对转变为相互依存；这样，才能改善城市的经济地位，从而改善城市人民首先是工人的生活；这样，才能抵制帝国主义的经济侵略，而不再受其剥削；这样，才能使城市领导乡村，变农业国为工业国；这样，才能巩固工农联盟，巩固从城市到全国范围的、无产阶级领导的、以工农联盟为基础的人民民主专政的政权。
    恢复和发展城市生产，对于我们，无疑地，是一件艰巨的工作，但决不是不可能做到的。首先，中国的工人阶级虽然在数量上是少数，而在质量上，则很坚强，并且大部集中在城市，只要我们忠诚地去依靠他们，发挥他们的力量，则恢复和发展城市生产的主观条件是具备了的。其次，现代化的工业在中国国民经济中，虽仅占百分之十左右的比重，但大都集中在城市及其周围。其中，最重要的，最大规模的，又都为帝国主义及其走狗官僚资本家所垄断。我们把它没收过来，作为新民主主义的国家财产。只要不分散，不破坏，不在经营上，犯农业社会主义及无纪律无计划的错误，则恢复和发展城市生产的客观基础也是存在着的。第三，在城市中，私人资本所经营的现代化工业，虽然是脆弱的，但也还存着相当数量。只要我们坚持保护工商业的政策，引导他们走向有益于国计民生的方向，在国家的经济政策和经济计划的轨道内，允许它们存在和发展，则对于城市生产的恢复和发展，将也成为一种有力的因素。最后，分散的、个体的手工业生产不仅在乡村大量存在着，而且在城市，特别是没有现代化工业的城市（如北平），也相当存在着。只要我们给予它们以适当的扶植，并把它们经过生产的、消费的、信用的以至供销的合作等方式，逐步地组织起来，则对于城市生产的恢复和发展，也是大有作用的。
    可以相信：无论从主观条件或客观基础上看，迅速恢复和发展城市生产都是可能的。问题只是在于我们是不是抓紧这一中心环节，进行这一重要工作（有些城市在我们进入以后，一个月，几个月，还未注意这一问题，是错误的），以及在进行这个工作中，是否能遵循正确的方向前进，而不致发生大的偏向。在我们不断地严厉批判了农业社会主义思想和纠正了消灭私人工商业的错误之后，今天，在恢复和发展城市生产中，可能或已经发生的主要偏向，是：
    一、不懂得或者不善于依靠工人阶级，团结其他劳动人民、革命的知识分子、以及自由资产阶级的代表人物、知识分子、民主党派，共同致力于建设城市从而建设国家的艰巨事业。有的不依靠工人，而依靠贫民，整日忙于放粮放帐施行救济。有的不依靠工人阶级，而依靠资产阶级，认为工人阶级一无所有，哪里能依靠他建设城市呢？这是一种右的偏向。殊不知工人阶级、其他劳动人民和革命的知识分子是人民民主专政的领导力量和基础力量。如果不忠诚地依靠工人阶级，认真地团结其他劳动人民和革命的知识分子，则革命力量便会变得脆弱，不仅不能完成建设城市、建设国家的任务，而且连人民民主专政的自身也将不能巩固。但是，另一方面，不分青红皂白，一脚把资产阶级完全踢开，不和他们团结合作，则是一种左的偏向。这会使革命力量陷于孤立，同样，对于建设城市、建设国家和巩固人民民主专政是有害的。
    二、只重视私营企业，而轻视公营企业；无原则地无限度地、无区别地扶植一切私人资本主义，而对投机操纵的、野蛮的、不利于国计民生的私人资本主义不加以必要的限制。当然，在今天，是需要私人资本主义发展的。这一政策，我们已经确定地定下来了，不能动摇。因此，给予它以过大的不适当的限制，致使不能发展，甚至趋于消灭，也是错误的。但由于我们的经济是以国营为领导成份，而使其他一切经济结构成份均向着有益于国计民生的方向发展。故对于私人资本主义中的投机操纵的、野蛮的、不利于国计民生的分子，必须在活动范围、税收政策、市场价格、劳动条件等各方面，加以恰如其分的必要的适当的限制，引导其发挥有益于国计民生的积极作用，防止其发生不利国计民生的消极作用。
    三、只知鼓励生产，而在供销上没有计划，没有办法，致使生产和消费脱节，供给和需要矛盾，生产品推销不出去，势不能不陷生产于停滞的状态中，且给予投机商人以操纵剥削的机会。为了避免这种弊害，必须一方面尽可能地、比较有计划地进行生产，另一方面在需要和可能的条件下，逐步地发展供销合作社。这种合作社是联系生产者和消费者的纽带，也就是沟通乡村和城市的桥梁。它以公道的价格，把工业品卖给乡村，而又以公道的价格，收买农产品，供给城市。这不仅可使乡村避免投机商人的中间剥削，城市获得粮食和原料，而且可鼓励农民生产，发展乡村经济。
    变消费的城市为生产的城市，是我们当前的重要任务。我们必须担负这个任务，完成这个任务。但由于我们长期脱离城市，转入乡村，对城市情况和工作，极其生疏，要完成这一重要任务，必须虚心学习，努力工作！
