　　Troops Crossing the Lugou Bridge
    Cai Gongdi
    (1) Three Times Troops Crossed the Bridge
    A little after nine o'clock, we arrived at the Lugou Bridge. A vast army was crossing, with cavalry, infantry, and artillery, stirring up clouds of red dust. These armed brothers were all full of vigor, majestic and spirited, truly a strong and powerful army. I asked a bridge worker standing next to me, who was waving red and green flags in welcome, "What do you think of this army? How does it compare to the armies of the past?" He joyfully replied, "I've been working as a bridge worker here for a long time and have personally witnessed three large armies crossing this bridge. The first to cross was the Japanese 'Imperial Army.' After this 'comet' passed, the Lugou Bridge changed, and Wang Kemin, a traitor, appeared in Beiping. I had no money and had to eat bean cakes for meals. The second to cross was the Kuomintang bandit army (when Japan surrendered), looting along the way. American reactionaries made things even worse, treating the Chinese as worthless and conscripting me, almost blinding me. The third to cross is the People's Liberation Army, saviors coming and going. In the past, my family of six had no way to survive, but after the PLA liberated us, we found a way. I work here as a bridge worker, earning one hundred jin of millet per month. My second younger brother went to Shijiazhuang to repair railways, earning two hundred jin of millet per month. With three hundred jin of millet a month, my family of six can live well, and my eyes have also been treated. If it weren't for the PLA, we wouldn't have this today! Praying to the gods for generations wouldn't have helped.
    This army is truly the people's army, always thinking of the people. Before you came, there was a blind man named Li. Because he crossed this bridge so often, he was familiar with it, so when the troops were crossing, he also rushed to cross. A young armed brother, fearing he would fall off the bridge, led him all the way across the Second Ferry Bridge before hurrying back, covered in sweat, to catch up with the troops. Carrying over thirty jin all day long and walking, they still don't forget to help the people. Of course, the people will never forget their army."
    (2) Victory Seen from the Flags
    The troops continued to cross the bridge, flags waving towards me. A worker coming from the Wanping direction also came forward and asked me, "What are all those flags for!" He wanted me to read them to him, so I read them to him. This flag coming over here is called "Military and Political Excellence Flag," followed by "Great Progress," "United as One, Strong as Steel," "Iron Fortress," "Victory Class," "Civil Affairs Model," "Not a Single Offense," "Discipline Excellence," "Make Great Contributions for the People"... I also explained to him that these flags symbolize the PLA's military achievements and discipline. He listened excitedly and said, "In the past, I only knew that the Communist army could win battles, but I didn't understand why. Now I know, since they emphasize unity, set examples, and make contributions for the people, how can they not win? The Kuomintang army doesn't have this ability, so they are bound to be defeated!"
    When the soldier with the green paper strip on his gun passed by, the worker asked me again: what are the words written there. I answered "Join the Party at the Front," and gave him a good explanation. After listening, he said: the Communist Party is truly a party for the people, party members are not afraid of losing their lives and shedding blood, for the sake of the people, you have to perform well on the battlefield before you can join the party. Only with such a party can China win.
    (3) A Poem
    Troops kept marching past me, and songs soared loudly. Suddenly, from among the singing group, an armed comrade came out, holding chalk, and started writing on the wall at the bridgehead. At first, because it was far from me, I didn't pay attention. Later, I saw many people gathering there, so I went over. The armed comrade had already finished writing the poem. Twenty-six years on Lugou Bridge, the Kuomintang army scurried south, if it weren't for the CCP fighting behind enemy lines, where would China be today!
    He smiled and read it to us, then, still smiling, returned to his unit.
    The writer left, but more and more people kept looking, the crowd growing larger and larger. Those who couldn't read asked what was written. After reading and hearing it, many people couldn't help but painfully recall the past: since the Lugou Bridge Incident, the Kuomintang bandit army was afraid of Japan like a mouse is afraid of a cat, abandoning the common people and fleeing to Mount Emei. If it hadn't been for the Communist Party's eight years of persistence behind enemy lines, where would we be today? Without the Communist Party, there would be no liberation today. The liberated people will forever mourn this painful past at the Lugou Bridgehead.
    (4) Old Ladies Busily Boiling Water
    Many old ladies and wives were here serving tea, and it is said that some, to thank the PLA for liberating them, even put white sugar in the boiled water. An old lady was in charge of delivering the water. When the following troops couldn't get water in time, some soldiers, parched with thirst, went to the well to drink cold water. The old lady quickly stepped forward to stop them, saying, "Comrades! Don't drink cold water, drinking cold water will make you sick. We haven't served you well, the boiled water will be here soon!" The old lady immediately went everywhere to check, and just then a young wife brought boiled water. The old lady called out to her, "Come quickly! Come quickly!" Then, in a reproving tone, she said, "Why did it take so long to boil? If the troops get sick from drinking cold water, how can you live with yourself!"
    In the midst of the commotion, a newly liberated soldier broke the old lady's water bowl. He immediately took out two thousand yuan to give to the old lady. The old lady said, "Comrade! No, no, you haven't been liberated for long (because the villagers all recognized the former Beiping Kuomintang army by the red circles on their arms), you don't have money, take it back!..." The liberated soldier returned to his unit, and the old lady said to a woman, "The PLA Communist Party is really capable! These people have only been liberated for a short time, and they have already been taught so well. In the past, not to mention one bowl, even if a thousand bowls were broken, they wouldn't pay, who would dare to ask them to pay!"
    (5) Watching the Troops
    Around three o'clock in the afternoon, I arrived at Changxindian, where I saw many male and female workers and students. Some were blowing trumpets, some were playing Chinese and Western music, and some were even performing clapper talks... I asked a worker:
    "How long have you been here?"
    "From after breakfast until now!"
    "Aren't you tired?"
    "To show our love for our own army, even if we are hungry and tired, we still have energy, unlike in the past when we were forced to wave flags and were full of anger."
    "Isn't the Devil Dog being performed here today?"
    "It was originally scheduled to be performed today, this Devil Dog is not bad, it came from Beiping. It was originally scheduled for today, Sunday, but because our troops are here, it won't be performed. No one would watch it anyway. If it were the Kuomintang army passing by, many people would be willing to go see the Devil Dog!"

### 芦沟桥上过队伍

　　芦沟桥上过队伍
    蔡公狄
    （一）桥上过了三次队伍
    九点多钟，我们到了芦沟桥，浩浩荡荡的部队正在过着，有骑后、有步兵、有炮兵，冲起滚滚红尘。这些武装兄弟，个个生气勃勃，雄赳赳，气昂昂，真个兵强马壮。我问站在我旁边的一位打着红绿旗欢迎的桥工：“你看这个队伍怎样？比过去的队伍怎样？”他欣悦的回答我：“我在这里当桥工时间长了，亲眼看到这桥上过了三次大队伍，第一次过的是日本‘皇军’。这个‘慧星’过去后，芦沟桥上变了天，北平出了不奸王克敏，我没有钱，买上豆饼当饭。第二次过的是国民党匪军（日本投降时），沿途洗劫，美国反动派更翻了天，把中国人看的不值钱，把我抓了差使，差些累瞎了一双眼。第三次过的是解放军，过来过去的都是救星。过去我一家六口没办法，当解放军解放后，有了办法了。我在这里当桥工，每月一百斤小米，我二弟到石家庄去修铁路，每月二百斤小米，一个月有了三百斤小米，一家六口人，便过好了生活，而且眼睛也医好了。不是解放军，那有今天呀！求神保佑，几辈也不成。
    这队伍真是人民的队伍，时时都为了人民。当你没来前，有个李瞎子，因为他经常过这桥过熟了，所以队伍过时，他也闯上去过。一个青年武装兄弟，恐怕他掉到桥下，一直把他牵过二渡桥，才满头大法跑回来追队伍。这样背着三十多斤成天走路，还忘不了帮助人民，人民当然也忘记不了自己的队伍。”
    （二）从旗子看胜利
    队伍不断的从桥上过去，队伍里的旗子一面一面的向我飘来。那从宛平方向来的工人，也走前来问我道：“那许多旗子干什么的！”要我念给他听，我便念给他，这面来的旗叫“军政优胜旗”，跟着来的“大进步”、“团结如一、坚若钢铁”、“铁的堡垒”、“胜利班”、“民运模范”、“秋毫无犯”、“纪律优胜”、“为人民立大功”……我并给他说明了这些旗子是标志着解放军的战功和纪律的，他听了兴奋地说：“过去只知道共产党队伍能打胜仗，为啥能打胜仗？闹不清。现在知道了，他们既然处处讲团结，表模范，为人民立功，那能不打胜仗呢？国民党军队是没有这本事的，所以非打败仗不可！”……。
    当那个枪上贴绿纸条的战士过时，那工人又问我：那里写的什么字。我答“火线入党”，并和他作了很好解释，他听了以后说：共产党真是为人民的党，党员是在不怕丢命流血，为了人民，在战场上干过了才能入党。只有这样的党，中国才能胜利。
    （三）一首诗
    队伍不断从我身边走过，歌声也不断嘹亮地飞扬。突然在唱歌群里，出来一位武装同志，拿着粉笔，在桥头壁上写起来。起初因为离我较远，没有注意。后来看见许多人在那里聚集了，我才走去，闰武装同志已把诗写完了。芦沟桥上廿六年，国民党军往南窜，不是中共战敌后，中国那里有今天！
    他笑微微的念给我们听，然后仍带着笑容归队去了。
    写的人走了，看的人却越看越多，越围越大，不识字的人也问写的什么？许多人在看了听了之后，都不禁沉痛地回忆往事：自芦沟桥事变，国民党匪军怕日本，象老鼠怕猫一样的，丢掉了老百姓，逃到峨嵋山。如果不是共产党八年坚持敌后，那里会有今天？没有共产党就没有今天的解放，翻身的人民，在这芦沟桥头将永远凭吊这件沉痛的往事。
    （四）老太太烧开水忙
    许多老太太、媳妇，都在这里招待茶水，据说有的为了感谢解放军解放她们，在开水里还放上白糖。送开水是由一个老太太指挥的。当后续的队伍，开水接不上时，有的战士口渴得没法，便走到井边去喝凉水。这老太太便赶忙上前拦住，说：“同志呀！不要喝凉水，凉水喝了要生病。我们没招待好，等一会开水就来了！”老太太立即到处去看，恰有一个年轻媳妇提了开水来了，老太太叫她“快来！快来！”随后又以责备的口吻说：“为什么烧得这样久？队伍喝凉水生病了，看你的心怎样过得去！”
    在手忙脚乱中，一个新解放战士把老太太的开水碗打破了，他马上掏了二千元给老太太，老太太说：“同志！不要，不要，你刚解放不多久（因老乡们都认识原北平国民党军是臂上有红圈），没有钱，拿回去！………”那解放战士回队伍了，老太太对一个妇女说：“解放军共产党本事真大呀！这些人解放没多久，就把他教好了。过去不要说一个碗，一千个碗打破了，也不赔，谁敢叫他赔！”
    （五）看过队伍
    下午三点钟左右，我到长辛店，在这地方，看到许许多多男女工人、学生，在这里。有的是吹号，有的奏中乐西乐，有的还唱快板，……我找一个工人问：
    “你们在这里有多久了？”
    “从早饭后到现在！”
    “你们不累吗？”
    “为了爱护自己的队伍，就是饿了累了也还是有劲，不象过去被人家强迫来摇摇旗，还装了一肚子气。”
    “今天不是此地演魔犬吗”？
    “本来是今天演的，这魔犬也还不错，北平来的，原定今天礼拜天演，因为咱队伍来了，所以不演了，演也没人看，如果是国民党军过，那许多人便愿意去看魔犬了！”
