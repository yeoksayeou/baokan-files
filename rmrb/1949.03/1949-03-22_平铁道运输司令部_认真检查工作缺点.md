Ping Railroad Transportation Command
Seriously Checks Work Shortcomings
[This newspaper reports] The Beiping Military Control Commission's Railroad Transportation Command, in order to ensure the timely and rapid loading and unloading of vehicles and to further improve transportation capacity, recently conducted a deep review of its military transportation work over the past two months. It pointed out that in the past two months, railroad transportation has achieved good results in supporting the war effort, supplying and exchanging urban and rural materials. However, regarding shortcomings in the work, the following three points urgently need improvement. First, vehicles were not delivered on schedule, which delayed troop loading. For example, a certain command needed 30 vehicles at Dongzhimen on February 28, scheduled for loading at 7:00 AM; however, the empty vehicles had to be transferred from Tianjin, and due to the inflexible vehicle dispatching, the vehicles were not delivered on time, arriving only at 11:34 AM. Second, due to the negligence of a certain unit, vehicles were not loaded and unloaded on time. For example, a certain corps needed seven trains, a total of 241 vehicles, at Langfang on February 17, scheduled for loading at 7:00 AM. The first train of empty vehicles arrived at 6:42 AM, and the remaining six trains were also prepared and arrived at designated locations such as Langfang and Fengtai; however, the unit did not arrive at the station to load until 2:40 PM that day, nor did they notify the reason for not loading, resulting in the loss of a certain amount of mechanical power and materials. Third, some passengers lack the concept of on-time departure. For example, 13 personnel from a certain unit planned to add a first-class passenger car to train number 526 on March 15 to go from Ping to Tianjin. After the train departed at the scheduled time, the unit personnel arrived at the station. In order to maintain the on-time departure of passenger trains, the railway could not drop the added first-class passenger car, resulting in it being hauled empty to Tianjin.
                                                                                                (Chen Ji)

　　平铁道运输司令部
    认真检查工作缺点
    【本报讯】北平市军管会铁道运输司令部为了保证能按时迅速的装卸车辆，进一步提高运输力量，近曾对两月来的军运工作作了深刻的检讨。指出：这两个月来，铁道运输在支援战争，供应与交流城乡物资等方面，都有良好的成绩。如就工作中的缺点而言，则有下述三点亟待改进。一、车辆未曾按照约定时间送到，以致延误部队装车。如某司令部于二月二十八日在东直门需车三十辆，约定在七时装车；但空车须由天津调来，以调度车辆欠灵活，未能届时达到，迟至十一时三十四分始行送到。二、由于某部的疏忽，致使车辆未能按时装卸。如某兵团于二月十七日在廊坊需车七列，共二百四十一辆，约定在七时装车，第一列空车于六点四十二分送到，其余六列亦备妥开抵廊房、丰台等指定地点；但某部到了当日十四点四十分，仍未到站装车，亦未通知不装的理由，以致损失若干机力物力。三、某些乘车人员缺乏按时开车的观念。如某部人员十三名拟于三月十五日加挂五百二十六次车头等客车一辆，由平去津，该车于规定时间开出后，该部人员始行到站。铁路方面为了保持旅客列车按时开车，故加挂的头等客车无时间甩下，致随该车空挂至天津。
