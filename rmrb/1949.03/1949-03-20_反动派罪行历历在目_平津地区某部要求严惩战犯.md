Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, March 18th. A certain unit of the People's Liberation Army in the Tianjin-Beijing area demands severe punishment for war criminals. At a discussion meeting, commanders and fighters of the unit sorrowfully exposed the evidence of the Kuomintang reactionaries' massacre of the people. Yu Ganjiang, a native of Jiangxi, recounted his personal experience, saying, "In 1937, the Kuomintang conscripted men in Jiangxi. My elder brother was seized, and because he couldn't bear the beatings and scolding from the officials, he secretly escaped. The bandits then grabbed me to replace my brother. Later, my brother was seen by a company commander of the bandit army, seized again, severely beaten, and then shot." Wang Songhai, who had worked in the military law office of the Kuomintang's 49th Army, said, "In the areas of Nantong and Rugao in central Jiangsu, I personally saw dozens of ordinary people being shot every day under the charges of 'farmers' association' and 'secret Communists.' After a female chairperson of a women's association was brutally murdered, her son, who came to claim the body, was also shot." Chen Yunxiang, who had worked in Shanghai, recounted the tragic circumstances of his two former companions who were tied to bamboo poles and split in two for going on strike. Other commanders and fighters also recounted the criminal facts of the war criminals that they had witnessed and experienced, one after another, making everyone in the room so grief-stricken that they could no longer listen. Landlady Li Da Niang was also moved to tears. Many people pointed out: These facts are just a tiny fraction of the bloody hatred that the people of the whole country hold for the Kuomintang reactionaries. The Kuomintang bandit gang has been massacring the people for more than twenty years, and the number of people massacred in this civil war alone is more than a million. Zang Mingliang, the deputy platoon leader of the engineering battalion who was wounded when the Kuomintang army attacked Jilin, said, "Some of the comrades who joined the army with me have already heroically sacrificed themselves or gloriously become disabled in the People's Liberation War. If anyone would forget the blood shed by the comrades on the battlefield, then let them pity those murdering executioners!" Finally, everyone unanimously demanded the thorough implementation of the eight peace conditions proposed by Chairman Mao, especially the item concerning the punishment of war criminals.

　　反动派罪行历历在目
    平津地区某部要求严惩战犯
    【新华社北平十八日电】平津地区解放军某部要求严惩战犯。在一个座谈会上，该部指战员沉痛地检举了国民党反动派屠杀人民的罪证。一个江西籍的于干江叙述他的亲身经历说：“一九三七年国民党在江西大抓丁，我家哥哥被抓去，他因受不了当官的打骂，偷着逃跑了。匪徒们又把我抓去顶替了哥哥。后来哥哥被匪军连长看见，又被捉去毒打了一顿以后枪毙了。”曾在国民党四十九军军法处干过事的王松海说：“在苏中南通、如皋一带，我亲眼看到每天有几十个老百姓在‘农会’、‘暗八路’等罪名下被枪杀。一个妇女会长被残杀后，又把她的来领尸的儿子枪毙了。”曾在上海作过工的陈云祥讲述了他过去的两个同伴因罢工而被绑在竹竿上劈成两块的惨痛情形。其他指战员也都把自己目睹身经的战犯们的罪恶事实一件又一件地说了出来，使全场人员悲愤得不能再听下去，房东李大娘也感动得心酸落泪了。许多人都指出：这些事实，不过是全国人民对于国民党反动派的血海深仇中的一点一滴。国民党匪帮屠杀人民已经有二十多年之久了，就在这次内战中被屠杀的人民又何止百万。曾在国民党军进攻吉林时负伤的工兵营副排长藏明亮说：“和我一道参军的同志，有些已经在人民解放战争中英勇地牺牲了或光荣地残废了，假如谁竟会忘记在战场上的同志们所流的鲜血，那么，谁就去怜惜那些杀人的刽子手吧！”最末，大家一致要求彻底执行毛主席所提的八项和平条件，特别是关于惩办战争罪犯的一项。
