　　Ping City Cracks Major Espionage Case
　　Head Culprit Wu Leiyuan Arrested and Under Interrogation
　　[Our Newspaper] The arrest of Kuomintang bandit secret agent Wu Leiyuan and others once again proves that in the people's city, any bandit secret agents who refuse to bow their heads to the people, are unwilling to repent and start anew, and conspire to continue engaging in counter-revolutionary activities will receive the punishment they deserve.
　　The main culprit in this case, Wu Leiyuan, the pseudo "Commander-in-Chief of the People's Commando Force," was captured by the Beijing Municipal People's Government Public Security Bureau on March 7. Those arrested at the same time included Li Guanqun, the pseudo "Deputy Commander-in-Chief of the People's Commando Force," as well as secret agents Fu Juemin, Jiang Ming, Liu Fohang, Guo Xinghan, and Wang Minhou. This is the second major espionage case cracked in Beijing, following the cracking of the Zhang Ni Yinwu espionage case. Wu was a major secret agent sent by the Kuomintang bandit gang's "Ministry of National Defense Security Bureau" to Ping. During the Anti-Japanese War, he engaged in espionage work in Shandong and other places, colluding with Japanese invaders to attack the Liberation Army and the people of Shandong. After the Liberation Army surrounded Beijing, Wu, under the leadership of Zhang Yinwu, organized counter-revolutionary armed forces, appointed himself as "Commander-in-Chief of the People's Commando Force," and vainly attempted to resist the people's liberation cause. After the Zhang Yinwu military espionage case was cracked, Wu continued to use the "Puji Buddhist Association" as a cover to organize secret agents and local ruffians who had sneaked into Beijing from various places, plotting to riot when the opportunity arose. In order to ensure the safety of the citizens and consolidate revolutionary order, the People's Government Public Security Bureau arrested Wu, Li, Fu, and other rebels. At the same time, it seized weapons, radio stations, and other military supplies. Among the arrested bandits, those who were coerced have been released on bail, and the ringleaders are under interrogation.

　　平市破获特务巨案
    主犯吴雷远落网后正审讯中
    【本报讯】国民党匪帮军统大特务吴雷远等的被捕，再一次证明：在人民的城市中，凡拒绝向人民低头，不愿悔过自新，且阴谋继续进行反革命活动的匪特分子，必将得到应得的惩罚。
    此案主犯伪“民众别动军总指挥”吴雷远系于三月七日被北平市人民政府公安局捕获，同时被捕者有伪“民众别动军副总指挥”李冠群、及特务傅觉民、姜明、刘佛航、郭兴汉、王敏侯等。这是继破获张逆荫梧特务案后，北平市破获的第二大特务案件。吴逆为国民党匪帮“国防部保密局”派遣来平的大特务，抗日期间，即在山东等地进行特务工作，勾结日寇，进攻解放军和山东人民。解放军包围北平后，吴逆更在张逆荫梧领导下，组织反革命武装，自任“民众别动军总指挥”，妄图对抗人民解放事业。张荫梧军事特务案破获后，吴逆仍以“普济佛教会”为掩护，组织由各地潜入北平的特务和地痞恶霸分子，阴谋待机暴动。人民政府公安局为保障市民安全，巩固革命秩序，遂将吴逆及李、傅等逆逮捕。同时并搜获武器、电台及其他军用物资一部。被捕匪徒中，胁从分子已予保释，为首者正审讯中。
