　　Lixian and Other Places Production Promotion Cooperatives
    Play a Big Role in Leading Mass Production
    [JiZhong Electric] According to the work of the Production Promotion Cooperatives in Lixian, Shenxian and other counties over the past year, it can be seen that the Promotion Cooperatives have played a significant role in leading mass production. The Lixian Promotion Cooperative used 1,254,671 yuan (RMB) in loans to support various production and construction projects such as water conservancy, agriculture, and sideline industries. In the development of water conservancy, loans were granted to 1,874 households, driving private investment of 227,230 yuan, digging 39 wells, digging 71 shallow wells, buying 121 waterwheels, and repairing 12 waterwheels. In terms of agricultural support, farmers throughout the county added 118 head of livestock and purchased 590 various farm tools. In addition, a portion of fertilizer loans were also issued. In terms of sideline industries: 9 looms and 17 spinning machines were loaned out; 6 lumber yards, 3 cotton ginning groups, 9 transportation and sales groups, 3 brick kiln groups, and 1 greenhouse group were organized. A total of 7 village cooperatives were organized, and 16 village cooperatives were restored. In order to strengthen the leadership of farmers' production and develop production, the Shenxian Promotion Cooperative added 7 promotion branches in various districts, actively carrying out leadership and support for farmers' production. According to statistics from December of last year, 105 village cooperatives, 270 oil mills, 280 pocket weaving machines, 11,070 looms, and 53,400 spinning wheels were restored in the county, most of which are actively operating. Based on the above production situation, the county promotion cooperative has determined its future leadership plan, actively transforming old village cooperatives, gradually developing new cooperatives, strengthening the support for the development of oil mills, flour mills, and pocket industry, organizing blacksmith shops, supporting lumber yards, manufacturing a large number of farm tools, and organizing well-drilling teams, purchasing waterwheels, and developing water conservancy. At the same time, in order to mobilize the masses to grow more special crops such as cotton and peanuts, the county cooperative has prepared 30,000 jin of cotton seeds, 50,000 jin of peanut seeds, and 14,000 jin of other varieties, ready to be loaned to farmers to promote large-scale planting. The Promotion Cooperatives in various counties still have some shortcomings in business operations, and there is still considerable blindness in business activities. In terms of loans, in-depth inspections were not carried out, and some were even mistakenly loaned to speculators and merchants for speculative transactions. Some cadres publicized large-scale loans without regard to actual strength, which disappointed the masses. These are all areas that need to be vigorously overcome in the future.

　　蠡县等地生产推进社
    领导群众生产作用大
    【冀中电】根据蠡县、深县等县生产推进社一年来的工作情况，可以看出推进社在领导群众生产上起了重大的作用。蠡县推进社以一百二十五万四千六百七十一元（人民币，下同）的贷款，扶植了水利、农业、副业等各种生产建设。在发展水利上，计贷予一千八百七十四户，带动私资二十二万七千二百三十元，打井三十九眼，打笨井七十一眼，买水车一百二十一辆，修理水车十二辆。在农业扶植上，全县农民增添牲口一百一十八头，购买各种农具五百九十件。另外还发放了一部分肥料贷款。副业方面：贷出织布机九架，纺纱机十七张；组织了木厂六个，轧花坊三组，运销九组，砖窑三组，暖坊一组，织口袋的六组。共组织了七个村合作社，恢复了十六个村社。深县推进社为了加强对农民生产的领导与发展生产，在各区共添设了七个推进分社，积极的进行了领导与扶植农民生产，按去年十二月份统计，全县恢复起村合作社一百零五个，油坊二百七十座，织口袋机二百八十张，织布机一万一千零七十张，纺线车五万三千四百辆，大部分都积极的活动着。该县推进社根据上述生产情况，确定了今后的领导计划，积极改造旧村社，逐渐发展新社，加强扶植油坊、粉坊、口袋业的发展，组织铁匠炉，扶植木厂，大量制造农具，并组织打井班，购买水车，发展水利。同时为了发动群众多种棉花、花生等特种作物，该县社已准备了棉籽三万斤，花生种五万斤，其他品种一万四千斤，准备贷给农民发动大量种植。各县推进社在业务经营上，仍存在着某些缺点，业务活动上也还存在着较大的盲目性。在贷款方面没作深入检查，有的竟错误的贷给投机商贩，做投机买卖。有的干部宣传大量贷款没有根据实有力量，因之使群众失望。这都是今后需大力克服的。
