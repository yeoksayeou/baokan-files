　　Ping City Eighth Repair Shop Workers
  　Organize Technical Study Group
    [Our Newspaper] Workers at the Eighth Repair Shop in Ping City have organized a technical study group. After studying, the workers in the shop understood the position of the working class in the New Democratic society and knew that they must improve themselves technically, culturally, and politically in order to complete the important task of construction. Initiated by workers Fan Guangsheng and Gao Yanchang, they spontaneously organized a technical study group, with eighty-three workers voluntarily signing up and electing Fan and Gao as preparation committee members. The class officially began studying on the 14th of this month. The study content includes mathematics, drafting, factory management, and work experience, etc., and they have invited the factory's engineers, technicians, and others to help with the research. As of now, the class has ninety-six students, nearly half of the total number of workers in the entire factory.
