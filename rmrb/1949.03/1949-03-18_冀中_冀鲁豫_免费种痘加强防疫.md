　　JiZhong, JiLuYu
  　Free Vaccination to Strengthen Epidemic Prevention
    [JiZhong Electric] The JiZhong Health Bureau convened a regional health work conference in late February. Fifty-two units and ninety-two people attended. The conference concluded that the three major health tasks for this year are: (1) Epidemic prevention and vaccination: In areas where medical associations have not been established, efforts should first be made to unite and organize doctors to form rescue teams to prepare for epidemic prevention and rescue. Regular epidemic prevention publicity should be strengthened, and rapid treatment should be provided in the event of an epidemic. In special circumstances, if the county rescue team cannot be applied in time, the special commissioner's office can quickly mobilize rescue teams from other counties to assist in treatment. All public hospitals should dedicate half of their resources to mass epidemic prevention and treatment work. In general areas, all unvaccinated children should be vaccinated to 100% this spring. Vaccination should also be widely carried out in densely populated towns and in organs, schools, factories, nurseries, etc. Vaccination should be carried out in all areas where smallpox is prevalent. From this year onwards, a three-dose vaccination method will be gradually implemented: the first dose at one year old, the second dose at around seven years old, and the third dose at around thirteen years old. The vaccine will be distributed uniformly by the Health Bureau and administered free of charge. Vaccination in all areas should be completed by around April 15th. (2) Counties and cities that have not established medical and pharmaceutical cooperatives must establish them before the end of June without affecting epidemic prevention and vaccination work to solve the problem of treatment and medication for cadres and the masses. Counties and cities that already have public pharmaceutical cooperatives should adjust, consolidate, and develop their organizational structure. District and village pharmaceutical cooperatives should be established more extensively in the ninth sub-district, and other special districts should establish them in a planned and focused manner. The location and personnel should meet the needs of the masses. In terms of business, the policy of genuine goods at fair prices and cash transactions should be adopted. Past debts owed to pharmaceutical cooperatives by some institutions should be repaid. (3) Maternal and child health work must be combined with the widespread publicity carried out by women's federations in various regions and districts to improve their health knowledge and break down superstitious and unsanitary feudal ideas and habits. Appropriate reductions or exemptions should be given to doctors for supporting the front lines. If they support the front lines, they should perform labor in the village to prevent double labor.
    [JiLuYu Electric] The JiLuYu Administrative Office, concerned about the health of the masses, has ordered health agencies and hospitals at all levels to conduct free vaccinations. It is understood that smallpox, which occurred in the Shijiazhuang and Pingshan areas, has been brought in by some people. The disease has been discovered in Zhuxian (Liaocheng) County. Now the Health Bureau of the Administrative Office has sent people to various organs to provide free vaccinations. It has also published common knowledge about vaccination and smallpox prevention in newspapers, calling on the masses to protect their health and go to hospitals entrusted or established by local governments to be vaccinated with cowpox free of charge for men, women, old and young.

　　冀中·冀鲁豫
  　免费种痘加强防疫
    【冀中电】冀中卫生局于二月下旬召开全区卫生工作会议。到会有五十二个单位，九十二人。会议结论中指出今年卫生方面的三大工作：（一）防疫种痘：医联会没有建立的地区，应先进行团结与组织医生成立救护队，做好防疫救护的准备工作。平时要加强防疫宣传，一旦有流行病发生时，迅速救治。如有特殊情况，本县救护队不能及时应用时，专署可迅速调动别县救护队协助治疗。各公立医院要拿出一半力量做群众防疫治疗工作。一般地区所有未种过痘的小孩，今春要求种到百分之百。人口密集的城镇及各机关学校、工厂、保育院等，也应普遍施种。天花流行地区一律进行种痘。并从今年以后，逐渐实行三次种痘法：小孩生后一周岁种一次，七岁左右种一次，十三岁左右种一次。痘苗由卫生局统一发给，一律免费施种。各地在四月十五日左右种完。（二）县及市没有设立医药社的，要在不影响防疫种痘的工作下，在六月底前一定建立起来，做到解决干部及群众疾病的治疗及用药。已有公立药社的县市，应进行调整巩固与发展组织机构。区村药社要求在九分区多建立，其他专区应有计划有重点地建立，社址和人员要适合群众要求。营业上采取货真价实现款交易的方针。过去有的机关拖欠药社款很多的要清还。（三）妇婴卫生工作，必须结合各地各区妇联会开展广泛宣传，提高其卫生知识，打破迷信和不讲卫生的封建思想及习惯。适当减免医生支前出勤。如支前出勤，应在村中顶勤，防止去双勤。
    【冀鲁豫电】冀鲁豫行政公署关怀群众健康，顷令各级卫生机关与医院，举办免费种痘。据了解，在石家庄、平山一带发生之天花，已有人带来，此病在筑先（聊城）县已发现。现在行署卫生局已派人分头到各机关免费种痘。并在报上刊登种痘和预防天花的常识，号召群众保护自己的健康，到各地政府委托或设立之医院去种牛痘，男女老幼均免费施种。
