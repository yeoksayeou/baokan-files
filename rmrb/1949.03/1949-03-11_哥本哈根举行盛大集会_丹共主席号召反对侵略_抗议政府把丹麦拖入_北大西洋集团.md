Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 9th. TASS, Copenhagen dispatch: A grand rally was held in Copenhagen on March 3rd to protest the reactionary group's attempt to drag Denmark into the aggressive "North Atlantic Alliance". The hall, which could accommodate five thousand people, was completely full. The audience listened attentively to the report by Danish Communist Party Chairman, Larsen. Larsen said: The threat of war is now real. The threat to our peace and national independence is also real. However, this threat comes from the West, and certainly not from the East. Our task is to fight against war, to maintain peace, and to maintain Denmark's national independence. Therefore, we oppose joining the United States' aggressive "North Atlantic Bloc" and oppose the arms race. If the people do not come out to stop them, the government and the various American-funded parties will turn Denmark into an aggressive military base for the United States to seize world hegemony. We know that the Soviet Union does not threaten us in any way. The Soviet Union is a socialist country, not an imperialist country. It has no plans for aggression; its people and government hope to cooperate peacefully with all countries, and they recognize the rights of independence and autonomy of all countries. Humanity will thank the Soviet Union for liberating them from Nazism. The Soviet Union is the largest and most powerful factor in maintaining peace. Let others declare their unity with the Wall Street billionaires; we want to declare our unity with the Soviet Union and the Soviet people, because they are fighting for peace, and therefore are also fighting to maintain Denmark's peace. We declare: We will be strong in the struggle for peace, in the struggle to defend Denmark from the horrors of war, and for our country's independence. In this struggle, we are together with the Soviet Union, with the people's democratic countries, and with the communist parties of all countries who are leading the struggle for the cause of the people and against the imperialists (who want to plunge humanity into a new war).
    
    The people attending the conference unanimously passed a resolution saying: We declare our strongest protest against the government's plan to drag Denmark into the aggressive "North Atlantic Bloc". We oppose the increasingly crazy arms race under the leadership of this bloc. Denmark has no common interests with the warmongers in Washington and London, and neither our country nor our people should be placed in the danger of a new war and destruction. Denmark is only concerned with peace; therefore, we demand that our country support the forces of peace in the United Nations Organization and support the Soviet Union's proposals for disarmament and the prohibition of atomic weapons. We demand that Denmark cooperate with the governments of all countries and all forces that are working to maintain peace. We call on all clear-headed and peace-loving Danes to support these demands.

　　哥本哈根举行盛大集会
  　丹共主席号召反对侵略
    抗议政府把丹麦拖入“北大西洋集团”
    【新华社陕北九日电】塔斯社哥本哈根讯：哥本哈根在三月三日举行盛大集会，抗议反动集团把丹麦拖入侵略性的“北大西洋联盟”的企图。可容五千人的大厅被完全塞满。听众们注意地听取了丹麦共产党主席拉荪的报告。拉荪说：战争的威胁现在是确实存在的。对于我们的和平与国家独立的威胁也是存在的。但是，这个威胁是从西方发出的，而决不是来自东方。我们的任务就是为反对战争、为保持和平、为保持丹麦的国家独立而奋斗。因此，我们反对参加美国的侵略性“北大西洋集团”，反对军备竞争。如果人民不出来阻挡，政府和美记各党就会把丹麦变成美国夺取世界霸权的侵略性军事基地。我们知道，苏联不管怎么样都并不威胁我们。苏联是社会主义国家，而不是帝国主义国家。它没有侵略计划，它的人民和政府希望与一切国家和平合作，他们承认所有国家的独立自主的权利。人类会为从纳粹主义之下解放出来而感谢苏联。苏联是保持和平的最大、最有力的因素。让别人宣布他们和华尔街亿万富翁们团结一致吧，我们要宣布我们和苏联与苏联人民团结一致，因为他们为和平而斗争，因而也就是为保持丹麦的和平而斗争。我们宣布：我们在为和平的斗争中，在为保卫丹麦免于战争恐怖和为着我国的独立的斗争中，将是坚强的。在这个斗争中，我们与苏联、与人民民主国家、与领导着为人民事业和反对帝国主义者（他们想把人类投入新战争）的斗争的各国共产党，是在一起的。
    出席大会的人一致通过决议说：我们宣布最坚决地抗议政府把丹麦拖入侵略性“北大西洋集团”的计划。我们反对在这个集团的领导之下的日益疯狂的军备竞争。丹麦与华盛顿和伦敦的战争贩子没有共同利益，而且不管是我们国家或我国人民都不应被置于新战争与破坏的危险之下。丹麦所关心的只有和平，因此，我们要求我国支持联合国组织中的和平力量，支持苏联的裁军和禁止原子武器的建议。我们要求丹麦与一切国家的政府和一切努力保持和平的力量合作。我们号召一切头脑清醒和爱好和平的丹麦人支持这些要求。
