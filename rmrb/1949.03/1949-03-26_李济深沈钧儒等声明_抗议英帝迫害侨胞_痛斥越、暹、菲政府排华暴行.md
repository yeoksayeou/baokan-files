Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 24th: Li Jishen, Shen Junru, Ma Xulun, Guo Moruo, Zhang Bojun, Tan Pingshan, Peng Zemin, Cai Tingkai, Zhang Naiqi, Li Zhangda, Chen Qiyou, Chen Qiyuan, Hu Yuzhi, and others have issued a statement regarding the persecution of overseas Chinese in Malaya. The full text is as follows:

　　The Chinese people's struggle against imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism is about to achieve complete and final victory. But at the same time, our millions of compatriots overseas are suffering cruel persecution by imperialist and reactionary rulers. This is something the Chinese people are extremely indignant about and cannot tolerate.

　　We want to particularly point out the recent series of brutal acts by the British government in Malaya to persecute overseas Chinese.

　　Since June of last year, the Malayan government has promulgated the extremely reactionary "Emergency Ordinance" to implement an anti-Chinese policy. In the second half of last year, according to official announcements, over four thousand overseas Chinese were arrested and imprisoned under the Emergency Ordinance, but the actual number was close to ten thousand. The majority of them have resided in Malaya for a long time and have contributed greatly to Malaya's production and construction. They have also made indelible contributions in the Anti-Japanese War and the anti-fascist war. After their arrest, most of them had no evidence of any crime, were imprisoned for long periods without trial, and suffered torture. A considerable number of them have been deported.

　　On January 10th of this year, British imperialism intensified its actions and promulgated the "Special Emergency Ordinance," adopting cruel methods of collective arrest, collective confinement, and collective deportation against overseas Chinese. In the interior of Malaya, as long as one or two so-called "suspects" are found, the entire village of overseas Chinese is sent to concentration camps and finally shipped to Shantou and Xiamen. The elderly in their seventies and eighties, underage children, and even the sick and pregnant women are not spared. In addition, in many parts of Malaya, the British government, under the pretext of military operations, set fire to entire villages inhabited by overseas Chinese. Under these circumstances, the loss of life and property suffered by overseas Chinese is naturally too great to calculate.

　　What kind of policy is this? It is even worse than the fascist brutal behavior adopted by the Japanese warlords during the occupation.

　　The governments that call themselves democratic countries and claim to be Labour governments have repeatedly announced that after the war, the people of the colonies would be granted democratic autonomy. Now, they have torn up all the promises they made to the people, violated the sacred principles stipulated in the United Nations Charter, and revealed the hideous face of new imperialist fascism.

　　In addition to Malaya, the Hong Kong government has recently promulgated the so-called "Security Ordinance" and "Education Ordinance," the purpose of which is to deprive our people of their due freedom and rights. Under the cover of these conditions, they arbitrarily search homes and arrest intellectuals. In February of this year, they closed the only democratic university for the local Chinese people – Dat Tat College – infringing on academic freedom and trampling on people's rights. Nothing could be worse.

　　We believe that the British imperialist reactionary policy of oppressing the colonial people and persecuting overseas Chinese is consistent with the anti-democratic and anti-people aggression policy instigated by American imperialism throughout the world. Moreover, outside of British territory, the French aggressors in Vietnam, the Dutch aggressors in Indonesia, and the fascist governments in the Philippines and Siam have all implemented the orders of American imperialism, encircling, suppressing, burning, killing, arresting, and persecuting patriotic people who are unwilling to be slaves, creating a reign of terror everywhere. Overseas Chinese who love freedom are inevitably imprisoned and deported everywhere. The reactionary government of the Chinese Kuomintang not only fails to assume its responsibility to protect overseas Chinese but colludes with imperialism, acting as an accomplice. Kuomintang secret agents openly inform everywhere and conspire to frame progressive overseas Chinese, committing all kinds of evil. The reactionary government at home detains and imprisons overseas Chinese who are forced to return home, and even extorts them with torture. The fact that the Chinese reactionaries are willing to act as accomplices of imperialist aggressors is further proven here. Therefore, we solemnly protest the reactionary policies currently adopted by Britain and other imperialists against overseas Chinese and colonial people. We express our warm sympathy and sincere condolences to the Malayan compatriots who have been persecuted and even deported back to their homeland. The final victory of the people's democratic revolution in the motherland is in sight. The future independent, free, and powerful democratic New China will strive to take on the responsibility of protecting overseas Chinese. Compatriots far away overseas, unite all democratic forces, oppose imperialism and its accomplices at home and abroad. The power of the people will eventually overcome everything.

　　Li Jishen, Shen Junru, Ma Xulun, Guo Moruo, Zhang Bojun, Tan Pingshan, Peng Zemin, Cai Tingkai, Zhang Naiqi, Li Zhangda, Chen Qiyou, Chen Qiyuan, Hu Yuzhi.

　　李济深沈钧儒等声明
  　抗议英帝迫害侨胞
    痛斥越、暹、菲政府排华暴行
    【新华社北平二十四日电】李济深、沈钧儒、马叙伦、郭沫若、章伯钧、谭平山、彭泽民、蔡廷锴、章乃器、李章达、陈其尤、陈其瑗、胡愈之等十三人，顷为马来亚华侨遭受迫害事发表声明一件，全文如下：
    中国人民反帝国主义反封建主义反官僚资本主义的斗争，就要得到全部的最后的胜利。但在同一时期，我们在海外的千百万同胞却遭受帝国主义反动统治者残酷的迫害。这是中国人民所极端愤慨而不能忍受的。
    我们要特别指出的是最近马来亚英政府迫害华侨的一连串的残暴事实。
    从去年六月起，马来亚政府颁布了极端反动的“紧急法令”，实施排华政策。去年下半年，依据紧急法令被捕入狱的华侨，据官方宣布有四千余人，实际上则近万人。其中最大部分均久居马来亚，对于马来亚的生产建设出力极大。在抗日反法西斯战争中，更有过不可磨灭的勋劳，他们被捕以后，大率毫无犯罪证据，不经审问，长期囚禁，遭受毒刑。其中被驱逐出境者，不在少数。
    到了今年一月十日，英帝国主义变本加厉，又颁布了“特别紧急法令”，对华侨采取集体拘捕，集体禁闭，集体遣送的残酷办法。在马来亚内地，只要发现有一二个所谓“嫌疑分子”，就把整个村庄的华侨全部送进集中营，最后押送到汕头和厦门。七八十岁的老翁，未成年的幼童，以至病夫孕妇，都不能幸免。此外，在马来亚许多地方，英政府借口军事行动，放火焚烧华侨聚居的整个村落。在这种情势之下，华侨所遭受的生命财产损失，自然多到无法计算了。
    这是什么政策呢？这比日本军阀在占领时期所采取的法西斯凶暴行为，竟有过之而无不及。
    自称民主国和自称工党的政府，曾经多次宣布战后要使殖民地人民获得民主自治权利，现在却撕破了一切对人民所许的诺言，违背了联合国宪章所规定的神圣原则，而露出帝国主义新法西斯的狰狞面目来了。
    除马来亚以外，最近香港政府也颁布了所谓“安全条例”、“教育条例”，其目的都是为着剥夺我国人民应有的自由权利。在此等条件掩护下，任意搜查住宅，逮捕知识分子。本年二月，竟封闭当地中国人民唯一民主学府——达德学院，侵犯学术自由，蹂躏人民权利，莫此为甚。
    我们认为：英帝国主义压迫殖民地人民，迫害华侨的反动政策，和美帝国主义在全世界所策动的反民主反人民的侵略政策，是一致的。且英属之外，越南的法国侵略者，印尼的荷兰侵略者，菲律宾和暹罗的法西斯政府，都同样执行了美帝国主义的命令，围剿、烧杀、逮捕、迫害不甘心做奴隶的爱国人民，遍地造成恐怖的统治。我华侨中爱好自由的人士，遂不免到处遭受囚禁与驱逐。而中国国民党反动政府，不但不能负起护侨责任，反而和帝国主义勾结，为虎作伥。国民党特务人员，到处公开告密，阴谋陷害华侨进步人士，无恶不作。国内反动政府，对于被迫回国的华侨，加以扣押、拘禁，甚且毒刑敲诈。中国反动派甘心作帝国主义侵略者的帮凶，从这里更得到了证明。为此，我们严正抗议英国及其他帝国主义对华侨和殖民地人民目前所采取的反动政策。我们对于遭受迫害苦难以至被驱逐回国的马来亚侨胞，寄与热烈的同情与诚恳的慰问。祖国人民民主革命最后胜利在望，未来的独立自由强大的民主新中国，将努力担负起保护海外华侨的责任。远在海外的同胞们，把一切民主力量团结起来，反对帝国主义及其在国内外的帮凶，人民的力量终必战胜一切。
