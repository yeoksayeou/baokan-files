　　【Shijiazhuang News】The Shijiazhuang City Government held a tree planting conference on March 5th, attended by more than 50 representatives from various agencies, units, districts, and streets in the city. Deputy Director Wang of the Construction Bureau reported on this year's tree planting plan, particularly emphasizing that this year's tree planting must guarantee survival, overcoming the past phenomenon of "planting trees every year and dying every year" and the attitude of irresponsibility after planting. The Construction Bureau will be responsible for preparing the required saplings. Various units immediately proposed guaranteed survival numbers. The Municipal Hospital guaranteed the survival of two trees per person, the Shijiazhuang Daily was responsible for the survival of 100 trees, the Coking Plant 830 trees, and Yumin Company 300 trees. The number proposed on the spot reached more than 10,000 trees. The various districts and streets and some units are still in the process of compiling statistics. Regarding the allocation of areas, in addition to each agency being responsible for nearby areas, the Municipal Normal School and No. 1 Middle School are responsible for Jiefang (Liberation) Avenue, No. 2 Middle School is responsible for Ping'an (Peace) Road, and Girls' Middle School is responsible for Zhongyang (Central) Road. The remaining larger streets are all the responsibility of the Construction Bureau and the Sanitation Brigade for planting. Managing planting and ensuring survival is the way to complete the task.
    Also, the Shijiazhuang Railway Bureau, in order to protect the roadbeds of the east and west lines, decided to plant a total of 62,530 trees along the west line and within the stations this year. 71,800 trees will be planted on the east line, and 29,400 trees will be planted by various units in the city. The bureau began preparing all the saplings last year, and the bureau will launch the tree planting campaign within days.
    【Our Newspaper】The Lin County Government issued instructions to launch a tree planting and afforestation campaign. The instructions stated: Before the Qingming Festival, the entire county must launch a campaign to plant one million trees, with an average of two trees guaranteed to survive per person. This work is seasonal, and every district and village cadre must earnestly and personally take the lead, educate and promote the masses to complete the task on schedule. Personnel in the village with tree planting skills should spread their experience to the masses. Each district and village should also draw out special personnel to form a tree planting inspection team to plant small trees along the roads, streets (especially market towns), river beaches, mountains, fields, open spaces, etc. that belong to each district and village. The source of saplings: households and villages can make adjustments with each other. Cadres at all levels must closely organize plans, promote this work, and promptly check and supervise watering to avoid seedlings from drying out and dying. And formulate a convention for the protection and management of forests.
