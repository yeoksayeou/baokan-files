The negotiations for the "North Atlantic Treaty," the main tool of American war policy, are continuing in Washington. According to U.S. Secretary of State Acheson's announcement on the 2nd, the content of the "treaty" may be announced soon. At the same time, the right wing of the international Socialist Party is also enthusiastically drumming up support for new war preparations. The Norwegian Labor Party (Social Democratic Party) government, disregarding the opposition of the vast majority of the Norwegian people, officially rejected the Soviet Union's proposal to sign a mutual non-aggression treaty between the two countries on the 3rd, and decided to participate in the negotiations of the "North Atlantic Treaty." The Norwegian ambassador to the United States, Morgenstierne, participated in the official meeting of the "treaty" for the first time on the 4th. The Foreign Minister of the Danish Social Democratic Party government announced on the 4th that he had decided to leave for the United States soon in order to establish "the best basis for the final decision on Denmark's attitude towards the Atlantic Treaty" with the U.S. government. The International Committee of the so-called "European Unity Movement," organized by the number one war-monger Churchill and supported by many right-wing socialists, held its first meeting in Brussels from the 26th to the 28th of last month, vigorously advocating war and faithfully serving the American war policy. The committee has elected the French scab Stonehouse as chairman. This shows that "socialist traitors are qualified to work side by side with warmongers" (Izvestia).

The war preparations of the international reactionaries headed by U.S. imperialism have been strongly attacked by peace-loving people all over the world. Since the leaders of the French and Italian Communist Parties, Duclos and Togliatti, issued statements that if war breaks out, the people of France and Italy will resolutely stand on the side of the Soviet Union, it has immediately aroused the support and resonance of the Communist Parties and the broad masses of people in many countries. A world movement to defend international peace is burning like a prairie fire. In France, a mass rally of 30,000 people was held in Paris on the 2nd, and the participants shouted: If the Soviet army pursues the aggressors to French territory, we will welcome the Soviet army as liberators! The French General Confederation of Labor, the Left Radical Party, participants in the Resistance Movement, and the French Peace and Freedom Comrades Association and other parties and people's organizations have issued statements, resolutely opposing new wars and the "North Atlantic Alliance." In Britain, the Executive Committee of the British Communist Party held an enlarged meeting on February 27 and passed a declaration calling on the British people to fight for peace. At the meeting, Harry Pollitt, General Secretary of the Communist Party of Great Britain, pointed out that the British working class must not overestimate the power of the warmongers. He announced that the Communist Party of Great Britain will launch a powerful national peace movement to make war impossible. In Germany, the Central Political Bureau of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany issued a statement on the 2nd, supporting the anti-war statements of Duclos and Togliatti, and calling on the German people to resolutely oppose the war propaganda and war preparations of Western countries against the Soviet Union. If aggression occurs, the German people must fight the aggressors and help the Soviet army achieve peace. William Z. Foster, Chairman, and Eugene Dennis, General Secretary, of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the United States, announced on the 2nd that the Communist Party of the United States will, together with millions of American patriots, jointly oppose those who attempt to cause a new war. The Austrian Communist Party stated on the 3rd that if Austria is dragged into a war against the Soviet Union and the new democratic countries, "the Austrian people, first of all the working class, will stand on the side of the Soviet Union and oppose the aggressors." The Communist Parties of Canada, Belgium, Argentina, Israel, Australia, the Philippines and other countries have successively issued similar statements. The Finnish Communist Party's organ, on the one hand, requires the people to step up the struggle for peace and be vigilant against war instigators, on the other hand, confidently pointed out: "At present, there is no reason to assume that the war instigators' conspiracy will succeed. The forces of peace now have sufficient strength to prevent the war-mongers' tricks and can save all countries in the world from falling into a new abyss of war." When war-mongers such as Churchill delivered speeches at a mass meeting in Brussels on February 27, the crowd at the meeting shouted "Down with Churchill" and "Down with war." In Denmark, the peace movement organized by the Communist Party has spread throughout the country, and grand anti-war rallies have been held in all cities and towns. The Peace Conference held in Copenhagen, the capital of Denmark, on the 3rd unanimously condemned the reactionary conspiracy to drag Denmark into the "North Atlantic Alliance." All these facts show the powerful strength of the world's people against a new imperialist war and the irresistible will to love peace. The consciousness and unity of the world's people are not only very different from the time of the First World War, but also greatly exceed the level of the Second World War. It has been proved that the imperialist elements want to drag the world's people into a new war by means of deception and threats, and attack the Soviet Union and the world's democratic forces, which is bound to fail. As soon as the war-mongers poked their heads, and as soon as the Atlantic Treaty and similar war preparation plans appeared, they were strongly resisted by the people of the world. If the warmongers dare to carry out war adventures, then the fire of war will not burn to the Soviet Union, but will burn to themselves. This is why the new war plan is bound to go bankrupt, and it is also where the war-mongers are unlucky.

While the imperialist countries are stepping up their efforts to save their facing economic crisis by attacking the working people and preparing for a new war, the Soviet Union, the leader in defending world peace, is continuing to rise in its economic construction and the people's lives are further improving. The Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union and the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union issued on February 28 the "Decision to Reduce the Prices of Consumer Goods in State-Owned Retail Trade Again from March 1," which specifically stipulates that the prices of various consumer goods will be reduced by 10% to 50%. This second new price reduction after the war will greatly increase the purchasing power of the ruble again, greatly increase the real wages of workers and intellectuals, and greatly reduce the consumption of industrial products by farmers, so that the Soviet people will benefit about 71 billion rubles a year as a result. After the decision was issued, the people of the whole Soviet Union cheered, and they "deeply thanked the Party, the government, and the great Stalin for caring for the working people like parents for a better time" (TASS). People in many parts of the Soviet Union held meetings everywhere to celebrate the coming of a happier life for them. Shutava, a female worker at the Kirov Textile Factory in Leningrad, said at the meeting: After the first price reduction, I already felt that life was more beautiful, and now I feel it is even more beautiful. The Soviet Union's new price reduction for consumer goods is the result of the great development of the Soviet economy after the war. The decision of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union and the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union pointed out that the further upsurge of the Soviet national economy, the increase in the production of consumer goods, and the new achievements achieved in reducing production costs have made it possible to implement a new price reduction for consumer goods. The following are other important international events in recent times:
	(1) The Romanian government recently promulgated a decree confiscating the land and agricultural implements of landlords and so-called "model farms" in order to eliminate the sabotage and sluggishness carried out by landlords in rural areas. The Central Committee of the Czech Communist Party issued a letter to 2 million Czech Communist Party members on the 4th, calling for "a hard struggle against the remnants of the bourgeoisie, against the reactionaries who are unwilling to surrender and continue to try to restore the capitalist enslavement system."
	(2) In all major cities in Italy and areas that were the center of guerrilla warfare during the Italian Liberation War, mass rallies were held at the end of February under the initiative of the All-Italy Guerrilla Association to protest against the authorities' release of fascists and persecution of former participants in the resistance movement.
	(3) A coup d'état took place in Bangkok, the capital of Siam, on February 26, launched by members of the Luang Thamrong cabinet, which was overthrown by Luang Phibuns, but this coup was suppressed by Luang Phibuns.

### 保卫国际和平的世界大运动象燎原之火一般燃烧起来了

　　保卫国际和平的世界大运动象燎原之火一般燃烧起来了
    作为美国战争政策主要工具的“北大西洋公约”的谈判，正在华盛顿继续进行，据美国务卿艾奇逊二日宣布：“公约”的内容不久或可公布。与此同时，国际社会党右翼亦正在替新战争准备热心地敲打边鼓。挪威劳工党（社会民主党）政府不顾挪威广大人民的反对，已于三日正式拒绝苏联所提苏挪两国签订互不侵犯条约的建议，并决定参加“北大西洋公约”的谈判，挪威驻美大使摩根斯端已于四日首次参加该“公约”的正式会谈。丹麦社会民主党政府的外长于四日宣布决定不久动身赴美，以便与美国政府建立“最后决定丹麦对大西洋公约态度的最好基础”。由第一号战争贩子邱吉尔所组织、并得到许多社会党右翼分子支持的所谓“欧洲统一运动”国际委员会，于上月二十六日至二十八日在布鲁塞尔召开首次会议大肆鼓吹战争，而替美国的战争政策忠实服务，该委员会已选出法国工贼石屋任主席。这说明“社会党叛徒们已够格和战争贩子并肩共事”（消息报）。
    以美帝国主义为首的国际反动派的战争准备，遭到了全世界爱好和平人民的有力的打击。自从法意两国共产党领袖多列士和托格里亚蒂发出假若战争爆发法意人民将坚决站在苏联方面的声明以后，立刻引起了许多国家的共产党和广大人民的支持和共鸣。一个保卫国际和平的世界大运动，正在象燎原之火一般燃烧起来了。在法国，二日巴黎举行了三万人的大集会，到会者高呼：假若苏军追击侵略者到达法国领土，我们将把苏军作为解放者而予以欢迎！法国总工会、左翼激进党及抵抗运动参加者、法国和平与自由战友社等党派及人民团体，纷纷发表声明，坚决反对新战争和“北大西洋联盟”。在英国，英国共产党执行委员会二月廿七日举行扩大会议，并通过宣言，号召英国人民为和平而斗争。会上，英共总书记波立特指出：英国工人阶级决不可过高估计战争贩子的力量。他宣布英共将发动一个全国性的强大的和平运动，以使战争不可能爆发。在德国，德国统一社会党中央政治局二日发表声明，支持多列士、托格里亚蒂的反战声明，号召德国人民坚决反对西方国家针对苏联的战争宣传和战争准备。如果发生侵略，德国人民必须与侵略者作战，帮助苏军达到和平。美国共产党中央委员会主席福斯特和总书记但尼斯二日宣布：美国共产党将和千百万美国爱国人士一起，共同反对那些企图引起新战争的人们。奥地利共产党三日声明：如果奥地利被拖入一个反对苏联和新民主国家的战争中，“奥地利人民首先是工人阶级，将站在苏联一边，反对侵略者”。加拿大、比利时、阿根廷、以色列、澳大利亚、菲律宾等国的共产党，都先后发表了类似的声明。芬兰共产党机关报一方面要求人民加紧争取和平的斗争，警惕战争挑拨者，另一方面充满信心地指出：“目前并没有理由可以假定战争挑拨者的阴谋会成功，和平势力现有足够强大的力量，能阻止战争贩子的诡计，可以挽救世界各国坠入新战争的深渊”。当邱吉尔等战争贩子二月二十七日在布鲁塞尔的群众大会上发表演讲时，会场群众报以“打倒邱吉尔”、“打倒战争”的喊声。在丹麦，共产党所组织的和平运动，已遍及全国，一切大小城镇都举行了反战的盛大集会。丹麦京城哥本哈根三日举行的和平大会，一致声讨把丹麦拖入“北大西洋联盟”的反动阴谋。所有这些事实，都显示出世界人民反对新的帝国主义战争的强大力量，和爱好和平的不可抗拒的意志。世界人民的觉悟和团结，不仅和第一次世界大战时大不相同，而且也大大超过了第二次世界大战时的水平。帝国主义分子想以欺骗和威胁的办法，把世界人民拖入新的战争，向苏联和世界民主力量进攻，已经证明是必然要失败的了。战争贩子刚一探头，大西洋公约和诸如此类的战争准备计划刚一出现，便遭到了全世界人民的强有力的反击。如果战争贩子们胆敢进行战争冒险，那么战争的大火将不是烧向苏联，而是将烧向他们自己。这就是为什么新战争计划一定破产，也是战争贩子们所以倒霉的地方。
    当帝国主义国家正在加紧地用进攻劳动人民和准备新战争的方法，来企图挽救其面临着的经济危机的时候，保卫世界和平的领导者的苏联，其经济建设正继续上升，人民的生活正进一步改善。苏联部长会议和苏联共产党中央委员会，于二月二十八日发布了“自三月一日起再次减低国营零售贸易中消费品价格的决定”，该决定具体规定各种消费品价格减低百分之十到百分之五十。这次战后第二次的新的减价，将使卢布购买力再度大大提高，工人和知识分子的实际工资继续大为增加，农民购买工业品的消费大大降低，这样，苏联人民在一年中将因此获得约七百一十亿卢布的利益。这个决定发出后，全苏人民欢呼雷动，他们“深深感激党、政府及伟大的斯大林象父母一样地关怀劳动人民的更好时光”（塔斯社）。全苏许多地方的人民到处集会，庆贺他们更加幸福生活的来临。列宁格勒基洛夫纺织厂的女工舒塔娃在大会上说：在第一次减价以后，我已经觉得生活比较美满了，现在我觉得是更加美满了。苏联这次消费品的新减价，是苏联战后经济大大发展的结果。苏联部长会议与苏联共产党中央委员会的决定中指出：苏联国民经济的进一步高涨、消费品产量的增加以及在减低生产成本上所达成的新成就，已使实行消费品的新减价成为可能。最近时期国际上其他的重要事件如下：
    （一）罗马尼亚政府近颁布法令，没收地主与所谓“模范农场”的土地和农具，以消灭地主在农村中进行的破坏和怠工。捷克共产党中央委员会于四日发表告二百万捷共党员书，号召“向资产阶级的残余、向不愿投降而继续力图使资本主义奴役制度复辟的反动分子进行艰苦的斗争”。
    （二）意大利一切大城镇和意国解放战争中游击战中心的地区，在全意游击队协会的发起下，均于二月底举行群众大会，抗议当局释放法西斯分子和迫害以前抵抗运动的参加者。
    （三）暹罗京城曼谷二月二十六日发生政变，系被銮披汶推翻的銮贪隆内阁阁员所发动，但这个政变被銮披汶所压服。【新华社陕北九日电】
