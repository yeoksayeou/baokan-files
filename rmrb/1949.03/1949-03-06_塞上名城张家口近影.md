A Recent View of Zhangjiakou, A Famous City on the Border
	Chahar Branch

	Zhangjiakou, the capital of Chahar Province, a famous city on the border, has seen smooth progress in its recovery and reconstruction under the leadership of the CCP Chahar Provincial Committee and the Zhangjiakou Military Control Commission since its second liberation on December 23rd of last year, lasting for a month. The working class has played a great role in this recovery and reconstruction. Before the second liberation of Zhangjiakou, the working class, with the attitude of masters, bravely protected the factories, so that the main machines, materials, and equipment of most factories were not damaged. For example, when the Kuomintang bandit army's 7th Garrison General Headquarters retreated, it ordered the employees of the 21st Automobile Repair Factory of its Joint Logistics Department to take away the machines they could, and destroy the ones they couldn't. The workers refused to carry out this reactionary order, and immediately sent people to properly store the machines, gathered more than 20 guns from the factory's guard platoon, and armed themselves to protect the factory. When the People's Liberation Army sent people to take over the factory after entering the city, the factory was in good order. Many workers of the Railway Bureau buried tools, telephones, and light bulbs during the enemy's encirclement. Their slogan was: every plant and tree here is our own, we must resolutely protect them and hand them over to the People's Liberation Army. This laid the foundation for the recovery and reconstruction of factories and enterprises. The Nancaoyuan Power Plant never stopped working. Fourteen public factories and enterprises, such as the lumber mill, rubber factory, brewery, and Zhangyuan No. 1 Flour Mill, have all started operations and business. Seven factories, including the oil pressing plant, match factory, and North Power Plant, have not yet resumed work due to serious damage by the enemy or lack of raw materials. Some are actively preparing to resume work. The city's electricity, telephone, and running water have not been interrupted, and employees have always persisted in their work. In terms of transportation: long-distance telephone lines from Zhangjiakou to Huaian, from Zhangjiakou to Chaigoubao, and from Zhangjiakou to Huailai have all been opened. Passenger and freight transportation from Zhangjiakou to Zhangbei Shangdu has resumed operation. The Ping-Sui Railway was opened to Qinghuayuan east of Zhangyuan on December 27th of last year, and to Xizhimen in Beiping on the 27th of the same month. The section from Zhangyuan west to Yongjiabao was opened to traffic on January 8th of this year. Postal services are connected to major cities in various liberated areas.

	After the first liberation in 1946, there were 3,201 industrial and commercial households. Due to the ravages of bureaucratic capital during the Kuomintang bandit gang's rule, this number was reduced to 2,405, a decrease of 23%. After this liberation, the number has increased by 18 in a short period. Among them, there are 577 industrial enterprises, including flour mills. In addition, there are 4,747 small business vendors in the city.

	Zhangjiakou has seven secondary schools. Before this liberation, there were 2,185 students. There are eleven complete primary schools, with 4,856 students before this liberation; and 53 primary schools, with 11,221 students before this liberation. All schools have now started classes. The current People's Government is running primary school teacher training classes, youth supplementary schools, and secondary teacher seminars to study New Democracy and establish the idea of serving the people. The People's Education Center has four branches, with an average daily readership of over 1,700 people. After being taken over by the People's Government, the radio station broadcasts local news and relays programs from the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Xinhua Broadcasting Station every day. Large slogans and paintings have been written in important streets and alleys, bustling areas, bridgeheads, markets, and stations throughout the city. Garbage and dirt on the streets have been cleared, and the city's appearance and all walks of life are showing a new atmosphere.

　　塞上名城张家口近影
    察哈尔分社
    塞上名城察哈尔省会张家口，自去年十三月廿三日再次解放，迄今月来，在中共察哈尔省委和张市军事管制委员会领导下，恢复与重建工作顺利进行。在恢复与重建当中，工人阶级发挥了伟大的作用。在张市再次解放以前，工人阶级以主人翁的姿态，英勇地保护了工厂，使大部工厂的主要机器、物资、器材未遭损失。如国民党匪军七兵站总监部在溃退时，命令其联勤部第二十一汽车厂修理厂职工，能带走的机器带走，带不走的破坏，工人们拒绝执行这一反动命令，立刻就派人把机器妥善保管起来，把该厂卫兵排的二十多支枪，集合起来，武装保护工厂。当人民解放军入城后派人接管该厂时，该厂秩序井井有条。铁路局的好多工人在敌人被围困期间，把工具、电话机、电灯炮都埋藏起来，他们的口号是：这里的一草一木都是自己的，坚决保护好，交给解放军。这就为工厂、企业的恢复与重建打下了基础。南菜园发电厂始终没有停工。制材厂、橡胶厂、酿造厂、张垣第一面粉厂等十四个公营工厂企业，均已开工和营业。榨油厂、火柴厂、北发电厂等七家工厂因被敌破坏严重，或因原料缺乏，现尚未复工，有的正积极筹备复工。市内之电灯、电话、自来水均未中断，员工始终坚持工作。在交通方面：由张市到怀安，由张市到柴沟堡，由张市到怀来各长途电话均已畅通。由张市通张北商都的客货运输业已恢复营业。平绥铁路去年十二月廿七日即已由张垣东通清华园，同月二十七日通至北平的西直门，张垣西至永嘉堡段今年一月八日即告通车。邮递已和各解放区的各大城市相通。
    一九四六年第一次解放后，共有工商户三千二百零一家，国民党匪帮统治时间由于官僚资本的摧残，减为二千四百零五家，减少了百分之二十三，此次解放后，短期间又增加了十八家。其中有工业包括面粉等业五百七十七家。另外，全市还有小商摊贩四千七百四十七户。
    张市有中等学校七处，此次解放前有学生二千一百八十五名，完小十一处，此次解放前有学生四千八百五十六名；小学五十三处，此次解放前有学生一万一千二百二十一名。现各校均已开学。现人民政府正举办小学教师训练班、青年补习学校、中等教师讲习会，学习新民主主义，树立为人民服务的思想。民教馆下辖四个分馆，每日平均阅览人数达一千七百人以上。广播电台为人民政府接管后，每天播送本市新闻及转播陕北新华广播电台的节目。在全市重要街巷、繁华区、桥头、市场、车站都书写了大型标语和绘画。街道的垃圾污秽均已清除，市容以及各行各业均呈现着新的气象。
