    (Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 8th dispatch) TASS dispatch: The latest issue of the New Era magazine published an article titled "Economic Progress of People's Democratic Countries," stating:
    Czechoslovakia's industrial production now exceeds 1937 by 10 percent. Poland's industrial production has exceeded 1938 by 51 percent. Bulgaria's output of production tools exceeds 1939 by 250 percent, and consumer goods by 150 percent. Hungary's industrial production exceeded the target set by the Three-Year Plan and exceeded pre-war levels by 27 percent. Romania's steel production greatly exceeds 1938, and its oil well drilling plan also exceeds the pre-war level by five times. The agricultural achievements of Poland, Hungary, Bulgaria, and Romania have enabled these countries to restore their exports of agricultural products, including exports to Western Europe.
    Patriotic production competitions have become one of the most prominent features of life in the People's Democratic countries. In stark contrast to all this is the situation in Yugoslavia, resulting from the consequences of the bourgeois-nationalist policies followed by the traitor Tito clique. The current leaders of Yugoslavia, by betraying the cause of proletarian internationalism and abandoning cooperation with the Soviet Union and the People's Democratic countries, have already doomed the failure of Yugoslavia's economic development plan.
    The economic achievements of the People's Democratic countries in 1948 also provided the basis for completing even greater economic tasks in 1949. This year, Poland will complete its first Three-Year Plan, with its total industrial output increasing by 25 percent and coal production doubling that of 1938. This year, Romania's industrial output will increase by 40 percent. Czechoslovakia's industrial output to be completed in 1949 (the first year of the Five-Year Plan) will greatly increase compared to 1948. In this way, the People's Democratic countries will reach a new level of industrial production this year. The expansion of industrial production capacity is the basis for guaranteeing a substantial increase in agricultural production, because the speed of agricultural development still cannot keep up with the needs of the People's Democratic countries and lags behind their potential. This idea of expanding mass production runs through the economic plans for 1949 and beyond. This year, Bulgaria plans to increase total agricultural output by 16 percent. Romania, calculated by the value of agricultural output, will increase by 40 percent.
    At the same time, the economic policies of the People's Democratic countries stipulate far-reaching measures to improve the living conditions of the working people. Housing construction plans are being greatly expanded; for example, Poland plans to complete a total housing construction volume of ten million cubic meters this year. The budgets of the People's Democratic countries for 1949 reflect the enormous plans of the masses. The budgets for 1949 are primarily budgets for reconstruction and further development of the economy. The budgets of the People's Democratic countries for 1949 are greatly increased compared to the budgets for 1948 (Hungary increased by slightly over 22 percent, Czechoslovakia increased by 25 percent). The main source of revenue for the budgets of the People's Democratic countries is drawn from the profits and business taxes of nationalized enterprises.
    In the work of building the foundation of a socialist economy, the People's Democratic countries have obtained the close cooperation, selfless help, and support of the Soviet Union. The expansion of the economic plans of the People's Democratic countries is aided by the increasing trade between the People's Democratic countries and the Soviet Union. At the same time, the economic relations between the People's Democratic countries and the Soviet Union, as well as their mutual trade ties, in no way restrict their possibility of developing trade with Western countries.

　　人民民主国家的经济进展
  　新时代杂志
    【新华社陕北八日电】塔斯社讯：最新一期的新时代杂志发表题为“人民民主国家的经济进展”的论文，内称：
    捷克斯洛伐克工业生产现已超过一九三七年百分之十。波兰工业生产已超过一九三八年百分之五十一。保加利亚生产工具的产量超过一九三九年百分之二百五十，消费品则超过百分之一百五十。匈牙利工业生产超过三年计划规定的目标，并且超过战前百分之二十七。罗马尼亚钢铁生产大大超过一九三八年，它的开凿油井的计划，也超过了战前该项工作五倍。波、匈、保、罗四国农业的成就，使各该国能够恢复它们的农产品输出，包括对西欧的输出在内。
    爱国的生产竞赛已经成为人民民主国家生活的最突出的特色之一。与这一切成为显明对照的，便是叛徒铁托集团所遵循的资产阶级——民族主义政策的后果所造成的南斯拉夫的状况。南斯拉夫当前的领袖们，由于背叛了无产阶级国际主义的事业，以及由于放弃了与苏联和人民民主国家的合作，业已注定南斯拉夫经济发展计划的失败。
    一九四八年人民民主国家经济方面的成就，还提供了完成一九四九年更伟大的经济任务的基础。今年，波兰将完成它的第一个三年计划，其全部工业生产量将增加百分之二十五，煤的产量将二倍于一九三八年。今年，罗马尼亚的工业生产量将增加百分之四十。捷克斯洛伐克在一九四九年（五年计划的第一年）所要完成的工业生产量将较一九四八年大为增加。这样，人民民主国家今年将达到工业生产的新水平。工业生产能力的扩大，是保证大大增加农业生产的基础，因为农业生产发展的速度，仍然赶不上人民民主国家的需要，而且落后于其潜在的可能性。这个扩大群众生产的思想，贯穿在一九四九年及以后的经济计划中。今年，保加利亚拟增加全部农业产量百分之十六。罗马尼亚按农业产量估价之计算，则将增加百分之四十。
    与此同时，人民民主国家的经济政策，规定了改善劳动人民的生活条件的远大措施。房屋建筑计划正大大地扩大，例如，波兰计划于今年完成的房屋建筑总体积达一千万立方公尺。人民民主国家一九四九年的预算，反映出群众计划的巨大。一九四九年的这些预算，主要的是重建与进一步发展经济的预算。人民民主国家一九四九年的预算，较一九四八年的预算是大大地增加了（匈牙利增加百分之二十二强，捷克斯洛伐克增加百分之二十五）。人民民主国家预算岁入的主要来源，是从国有化企业的利润和营业税中抽取的。
    在建设社会主义经济基础的工作中，人民民主国家获得苏联密切的合作、大公无私的帮助与支持。人民民主国家经济计划的扩大，得助于各人民民主国家与苏联之间日益增大的贸易来往。同时，人民民主国家与苏联的经济关系以及他们相互之间的贸易联系，绝不限制其对西方国家发展贸易的可能性。
