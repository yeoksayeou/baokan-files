　　Staff Creates Substitute Equipment
　　Jiaozuo Coal Production Increases Sevenfold
　　Shijiazhuang Electric Company Successfully Tests Transformer Installation
　　[Taihang News] The output of Jiaozuo Xinhua Coal Mine has increased from 150 tons per day under Kuomintang rule to 1,200 tons per day today. One of the important reasons for this is that all employees have highly developed their creativity, overcoming numerous equipment difficulties, and ensuring the smooth recovery of the factory and the operation of the machines. According to statistics, nine kinds of substitutes have now been proven effective: 1. Machine oil is lacking and difficult to purchase, so it is replaced with hemp seed oil. 2. The air ducts used for local fans in the mine were originally made of thin iron plates. Now there is no material, so they are made of cloth sewn into a cylindrical shape and coated with oil, which is not only airtight but also more convenient to transport. 3. If there are no rubber gaskets at the joints of the water pipes, water will inevitably leak. The best solution is to use iron gaskets wrapped in cloth. 4. Transformers are most easily damaged without oil, but there is nowhere to buy it, so soybean oil is used instead. 5. Yellow and black tape is a necessary product for wrapping electrical wire joints or exposed wires to prevent electrical leakage, but there is nowhere to buy it, so cloth strips coated with yellow wax are used instead. 6. Packing is mostly made of rubber or asbestos rope. Now, due to the shortage of this material, it is replaced by woven cotton yarn. 7. Due to the shortage of foreign nails, local fish-eye nails of various sizes are used instead. 8. Recently, there has been a shortage of wiring. Small electric motors are broken and cannot be repaired, but in areas with gas in the mine, fans must be used. To ensure the safety of workers and avoid fire hazards, hand-cranked local fans are manufactured to replace electric power. 9. Where airflow crosses, in order to avoid confusion of wind direction, mixing of new and old air, and reduction of wind power, a wind bridge must be built. This is both labor-intensive and limited by materials, so several large iron air ducts are used to cross over, so that other airflows are not disturbed, and the wind power is also good. (Xiao Yu)
　　[Shijiazhuang News] Workers in the laboratory of Shijiazhuang Electric Company continue to promote the creative spirit in the competition and assembled a three-phase 60KVA transformer. Transformers are one of the most lacking materials in current electrical engineering. Those sold on the market are manufactured unscientifically and are not durable. The workers in the laboratory said: If others can do it, why don't we give it a try? Everyone can also take the opportunity to learn technology. At the end of last month, Section Chief Chen Shutang suggested that everyone participate freely and work two hours after get off work every day. All the workers in the laboratory agreed to this proposal. After two weeks of hard work, the plan was successfully completed. More than half of the materials for this transformer were parts of usable equipment recovered from the scrap pile. Therefore, in terms of cost, it can save about 100,000 yuan in Renminbi. During the experiment, the workers became more and more enthusiastic. They often worked for three hours every night instead of the stated two hours. After the success, everyone was extremely happy and prepared to take a few days off before working on a new one. The apprentices also said: Learning like this makes progress very quickly!

### 职工创造代用器材焦作煤产提高七倍  石市电灯公司试装变压器成功

　　职工创造代用器材
    焦作煤产提高七倍
    石市电灯公司试装变压器成功
    【太行讯】焦作新华煤矿产量，已由国民党统治时日产一百五十吨增至今日之日产一千二百吨，其重要原因之一，乃为全体职工高度发挥创造性，克服重重器材困难，保证了工厂的顺利恢复与机器的开动。据统计，现已证明有效的代用品共九种：一、机器油缺乏难以购入，用大麻子油代用。二、井下局部扇风机所用之风管，原为薄铁板所制成，刻下无材料，则用土布缝成筒状，涂以油类，既不漏风，运搬更为便利。三、水管接头处无胶皮垫，势必漏水，则用铁打垫包以土布使用最好。四、变压器无油最易烧坏，但又无处购买，则用豆油代替之。五、黄黑胶带为缠裹电线接头或明线防止电线跑电之必需品，然无处购买，则用布条涂以黄腊代替。六、盘根多系胶质或石棉绳，现因此料短少，利用洋线编织代替。七、现因洋钉缺少，则以土产大小鱼眼钉代替之。八、近来钞包线缺少，小电马达坏了无法修理，而井下有煤气之区，又非用风扇不可，为了保证工人安全，免除火患，则修造手摇局部扇风机以代替电力发动。九、风流交叉之处，为免除风向混乱，新旧风混合，及减低风力，必须建筑风桥于该处，这样做既费工，且限于材料，为此即利用几个大铁风管横过，其他风流则不混乱，而风力亦佳。（萧雨）
    【石家庄讯】石家庄电灯公司试验室工人继续发扬竞赛中的创造精神，装成一个三相六十ＫＶＡ变压器。变压器是现在电气工程上顶缺乏的材料之一，市上卖的，制造不科学，也不耐用。试验室的工人们说：人家能做，咱们为什么不试试？大家又可以趁机会学学技术。上月底陈树棠股长提议大家自由参加，每天下班后工作两小时，试验室工人都同意这个提议。经过两星期的努力，胜利完成了计划。而这台变压器，有一半以上的材料是从废料堆中检出的部份的可用器材。因此从成本上说，大约可节省人民币十万余元。在试验的过程中，工人们越干越起劲，每晚说是试验两小时，常常要干三小时。成功以后，大家都高兴的了不得，准备歇几天再搞一台新的。学徒们也都说：这样学习进步可快呢！
