Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 15th: The postal and telecommunications services in the Northeast Liberated Area are developing rapidly. According to statistics from the Postal and Telecommunications General Bureau of the Communications Department of the Northeast Administrative Committee: there are currently 1,523 postal and telecommunications bureaus and offices in the entire Northeast region (including 284 bureaus, 175 offices, and 1,064 agency offices), more than double the 750 in 1947 (including 227 bureaus, 43 offices, and 480 agency offices). The main and branch lines for telegraph and telephone reach 12,381 kilometers, also more than double the 6,530 kilometers in 1947. All these bureaus, offices, and lines connect various cities and larger towns in Northeast China. Communication from Shenyang to major cities in all directions is particularly convenient. The business scope of the Northeast Postal Bureau is also expanding, with a dramatic increase in the number of letters, packages, insured letters, etc. it accepts. In December 1948 alone, the number of letters accepted reached 2,878,110, exceeding the total of 2,758,091 for the entire year of 1947. Based on the population of nearly 40 million in Northeast China, this reaches an average communication capacity of fifteen people sending one letter per month. The delivery of all letters in various places is extremely fast, and accidents such as loss are extremely rare. The Postal and Telecommunications General Bureau of the Communications Department of the Northeast Administrative Committee plans to consolidate the postal and telecommunications services in northern Manchuria and restore them in southern Manchuria this year, so that the postal and telecommunications services in the entire Northeast will continue to improve on the existing basis.
    Xinhua News Agency, East China, 15th: In order to meet the needs of the ever-developing postal and telecommunications businesses, the Shandong Provincial Postal and Telecommunications Administration Bureau has been officially established recently. The postal and telecommunications services in the Shandong Liberated Area began on February 7, 1942. Thanks to the efforts of all employees over the past seven years, despite the extremely difficult circumstances, they have always ensured the communication of the Party, government, military, and civilians, the distribution of Party newspapers, and met the cultural needs of the people, with more than 200 employees sacrificing their lives for this cause. When the postal and telecommunications services were first established, there were only a few wartime post offices and Party newspaper distribution centers, with forty or fifty cadres, and the scale was extremely small. Today, postal bureaus at or above the county level and district postal offices have developed to 771 locations (including urban and rural areas), with more than 100,500 employees, and the total length of postal routes in the province reaches more than 57,000 li. With the development of the victorious situation, the Shandong Liberated Area has successively opened postal services with the Central Plains, North China, Central China, and other liberated areas, and has established postal remittance and other services in cities such as Jinan, Xuzhou, Weifang, Yantai, Zhuozhou, and Jining.

  　山东省成立邮电管理局
    【新华社沈阳十五日电】东北解放区的邮电事业，正在飞跃发展中。据东北行政委员会交通部邮电总局统计：目前全东北境内共有邮电局、所一千五百二十三个（内二八四个局，一七五个所，一○六四个代办所），较一九四七年的七百五十个（内二二七个局、四三个所、四八○个代办所）增加了一倍以上。电报电话干支线路达一万二千三百八十一公里，较一九四七年的六千五百三十公里，也增加了一倍。所有这些局所和线路，联结着东北各个城市和较大的村镇。由沈阳向四周各大中城市通话，尤为便利。东北邮政局的业务范围亦日益扩大，其所接受的信件、包裹、保险信等数量有惊人的增加。仅一九四八年十二月份一个月所接受的信件，即达二百八十七万八千一百一十件，超过了一九四七年全年二百七十五万八千零九十一份的总数。若以东北近四千万人口计算，则达到平均每月十五个人寄一封信的通讯能力。各地对一切信件传递极速，遗失等事故极少。东北行政委员会交通部邮电总局，计划在今年内巩固北满和恢复南满的邮电业务，使全东北的邮电业务在现有基础上继续改进。
    【新华社华东十五日电】为了适应日益发展的邮政、电讯业务的需要、山东省邮电管理局已于日前正式成立。山东解放区的邮电事业，开始成立于一九四二平二月七日。七年来由于全体员工的努力，在万分的困难的情况下，始终保证党政军民的通讯及党报的发行，供应人民的文化需要，并有二百余员工为此牺牲了生命。当邮电事业初建立时，只有几个战时邮局及党报发行所，四五十干部，规模极小。今天县以上各级邮局及区邮务所等已发展到七百七十一处（包括城市及农村），拥有员工十万零五百余人，全省邮路长达五万七千余里。随着胜利形势的发展，山东解放区又和中原、华北、华中等解放区先后通邮，并在济南、徐州，潍坊、烟台、涿州、济宁等城市举办了邮政汇兑等业务。
