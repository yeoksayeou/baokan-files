People's Currency Conversion to Zhongzhou Currency is Incorrect, Hope Shijiazhuang Branch Investigates

To the Editors:
    In the People's Daily, January 31st, fourth edition, the Huabei People's Bank's response regarding various issues of the new currency issuance, divided into eight major questions, the answer to the second question is: One yuan of People's Currency equals two yuan of Zhongzhou Currency. On Sunday, February 6th, I went to the Shijiazhuang People's Bank to exchange 825 yuan of Zhongzhou Currency, and according to the regulations, I should have been paid 412.50 yuan of People's Currency. However, the bank official in charge calculated it at a rate of four yuan of Zhongzhou Currency equals one yuan of People's Currency. Is this calculation correct? Should I be paid according to the regulations? Please reply.

Comrade Haitao: Your criticism of the Shijiazhuang People's Bank is correct. Their conversion method is incorrect. The People's Bank should investigate and return the underpaid money to you.

### 人民券折合中州币有错望石家庄分行检查

专栏：

　　人民券折合中州币有错望石家庄分行检查编辑同志：
    人民日报元月三十一日第四版登载华北人民银行答复：有关新币发行各种问题中，共分八大问题，对第二个问题的解答是：人民券一元等于中州币二元。我于二月六号星期日那天，到石家庄市人民银行兑换中州币八百二十五元，按规定该付我人民券四百一十二元五角。可是，银行负责同志是按四元中州币等于人民券一元给我计算的。这样的计算法是否对呢？是否该按规定给我呢？请答复。

    海涛同志：你对石家庄人民银行提出批评是对的，他们那样给你折合是不对的，人民银行应作检查，并应将少付给你的钱退还。
