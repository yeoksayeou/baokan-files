Workers' Writings

　　We are in Competition
    (Female Worker Fei Yuemei, Clerk Wang Zhengxin, Da Xing Cotton Mill, Shijiazhuang)
    I. "Spinning Frame, Spin Faster!"
    Since the competition began in our factory, workers, in order to increase production, although the faster the machine the harder the work, they always feel the machine is spinning too slowly, and say as if praying, "Spinning frame, spin faster!" Zhang Guizhen, a new female worker on the spinning frame, finishes doffing yarn very quickly and goes to try and speed up the machine. Moreover, she is always the first to run to do so; because of this, she even had an argument with female worker Tian Fuzhen.
    II. Spindle Tape Breaks, Grow it Yourself
    "If a spindle tape breaks, all four spindles stop." Before the competition, workers generally didn't care about growing spindle tapes, "Anyway, when it stops, you have four less ends to tie." Now that the competition has started, workers are dissatisfied even if one thread is missing. Do you think she would want to lose four cops of yarn? As soon as a spindle tape breaks, they immediately look for the spindle tape worker. If they can't find them, they push the spindle tape cart from far away, very quickly. What's more, some workers, like doffing worker Hao Dongjie, don't need a spindle tape worker, they can grow the spindle tape themselves.
    III. "I've Learned to Repair Leather Straps Too!"
    Before the competition, most of the workers on the spinning frames, especially the female workers, only knew how to tie ends. Anyway, if it broke, they would just tie it. They didn't know how to find the cause of the break. As the saying goes, "Tying fast is not as good as breaking less." Some workers even practiced what they called "tie tightly, practice tightly; tie slowly, practice slowly." If tying became too troublesome, they would simply break the yarn. Originally, there were many yarn guides on the spinning frame. The spindle wouldn't turn because it lacked oil. The top roller had a groove pressed into it by the roving. The leather strap was cracked. In the past, only a few older male workers could find these problems and repair them. Now that the competition has started, the female workers realize that the method of blindly tying ends won't work. Even if they don't know how, they have to learn. You can see in the workshop that they are scrambling for new top rollers, replacing bad leather straps, and adding spindle oil and top roller oil. It's no longer just one or two people doing this. Zhang Fengjuan, a female worker who just transferred from an old machine to a new one, said, "I've learned to repair leather straps too."
    IV. "You're Not Allowed to Do a Wrong Tie!"
    Before the competition, our management personnel mainly relied on their own inspection and supervision to motivate workers to produce actively. But how can one or two people inspect hundreds of people? Even if you are capable, how can you see whether everyone is tying ends according to the correct method, not using the wrong tie (a wrong tie is an incorrect method), because that only takes half a second at most. Now that the competition has started, they not only have to compete on output, but also on quality; in order to make the group's work good, not only must they themselves be good, but everyone must be good. Once, female worker Zhang Guizhen saw female worker Wang Guizhen in her group tying ends incorrectly and quickly ran over and said, "You're not allowed to do a wrong tie!" Although Wang Guizhen was unhappy at the time, she quickly paid attention and corrected herself. Imagine, isn't every worker now a foreman!
    V. Competition Within the Competition Group
    As the production competition gets going, each machine and each group is seeing who can outperform whom. One group on the old machine section has also started a competition within the group. Doffing worker Bai Lanhua, spinning worker Li Fengjin, Yao Shunqi, and Wang Dani, etc., in order to get a red flag that is higher than the others, they said, "Let's have a competition within our group, and we guarantee not to run the machine, not to go to the restroom casually, not to practice knots, not to be absent from work, to come to work early, to eat quickly..." As a result, this motivated even old male worker Feng Guangshun, who had always been unenthusiastic about production.
    VI. Forgetting to Drink Water and Eat
    In order to compete for the red flag, many workers only eat one meal (this spirit is very good, but it is not good for the body, and should be persuaded to correct it). Many of the workers who are eating don't sit down to eat, they eat while walking around the workshop. Doffing worker Yan Jinfen didn't have a flag hanging on her machine; when she returned home, she couldn't eat her meal, and couldn't sleep. Her mother even thought she had something on her mind! Spinning worker Li Guixiang got a lump on her neck because she didn't have a flag hanging. When the management personnel saw this situation, they said to them, "You can't do this, working without eating or drinking!" Doffing worker Wei Xiangni said, "You don't know, as soon as I see a knot on the machine, I forget to drink water and eat."
    VII. Doing Anything is Not as Important as Competing!
    Inside the yarn factory there is an open space, the air is quite cool, next to it is a boiling water room, and there are cold water pipes, low tables, and benches. Before the competition, workers, especially some female workers, often went there to slack off, chat, comb their hair, and wash their faces. In particular, combing hair, some individual female workers combed it several times. They comb it, look in the mirror, if it doesn't look good they comb it again. This had a great impact on production. The engineering department wrote a notice to overcome this phenomenon, but it still didn't overcome it. During the competition, this phenomenon disappeared. The workers said, "We came here to work, combing our hair and washing our faces too much will delay things." Female workers Liu Guizhen, Wang Dani, etc., from the time they started work to the time they finished work, their bodies were covered in fluff like snow, but they didn't bother to sweep it off. Many female workers' hair seemed to turn white. Once, a spinning worker secretly took out a mirror from the machine and combed the fluff out of her hair. Doffing worker Quan Pingjin also quietly walked over and said, "Competition is important, don't worry about whether it looks good or not!"
    VIII. "If You Don't Help Me, I'll Still Help You."
    With the production competition, the spirit of mutual assistance has spread widely in various factories, "You help me, I help you." A new situation has emerged here: "If you don't help me, I'll still help you." Like Quan Pingjin, Zhang Fengjuan, Zhang Guizhen, Tian Fuzhen, Cai Dani, etc., after doing a good job on their own machines, they often run to other groups to help tie ends and thread the yarn. What effect do you think this kind of spirit will have? Here, I think there must be workers thinking this way: "People are skipping over their own group to help me, what face do I have to keep practicing knots?"
    In the competition group, there is one or two doffing workers, they lead this group, helping to watch the spinning workers, and the spinning workers treat them like their little leaders. Occasionally, if the superiors transfer the doffing worker even once, it is a very difficult matter, and they will all cry. Do you think this was something that existed before liberation? You can ask any doffing worker.
    "Are there still workers in your group who are not working well?"
    "Yes."
    "How do you treat them?"
    "Persuasion and education!"
    "What if they don't listen?"
    "Help them more, if they are lazy, I will help them, people's hearts are not made of iron, they will eventually correct themselves."

### 我们在竞赛

专栏：工人习作

　　我们在竞赛
    （石家庄大兴纱厂女工费月梅、职员王正心）
    一、“细纱车呀，你快转呀！”
    我们厂里自竞赛以来，工人为增产出数，虽然车快了活儿难做，但她们总是嫌车转的慢，象祈祷似的说：“细纱车呀，你快转呀！”新车女工张桂珍落罢纱，很快就去打快车，而且每次都是她先跑去打；因为这还和女工田福珍吵了一架。
    二、锭带断了自己生
    “锭带断一根，四个锭子停全”竞赛前一般工人不关心生锭带，“反正停了少接四个头。”竞赛了，工人们的心里是少一根线都是不满意的，你想她愿意少四个穗子吗？只要一断了锭带，马上就去找锭带工，找不着他们时，自己就老远老远的把锭带车子，飞快的推过来。更有的工人，就象落纱工郝东姐不用锭带工，自己把锭带就生起来。
    三、“我也学会修理皮套了！”
    竞赛前细纱大多数的工人们，特别是女工们，光知道接头，反正是断了就接，不知道找断头的原因，常言说：“接的快不如断的快”，更有的工人所谓“紧接紧练，慢接慢练”，接的麻烦了，干脆就把细纱揪断了。原来细纱车上道口是很多的，锭子没油不转了，皮辊让粗纱压成沟了，皮套裂缝了，关于这些断头的原因，过去仅是几个老男工才会找到这些毛病，加以修理。竞赛了，女工们发觉死接头的办法不行，不会也要学习了，你到车间可以看，在抢着新皮辊，在换掉坏皮套，在加着锭子油皮辊油，已经不是一两个人的事了。刚从老车调到新车的女工张凤娟说：“我也学会修理皮套了。”
    四、“你不准对头儿！”
    没有竞赛前，我们管理人员为要使工人们积极生产，主要靠了自己检查与监督，但你一两个人如何检查得到几百个人呢！就是你能力强，你如何能看到每个人是否都按着接头儿不按对头儿呢（对头是错误的方法），因为那对一下顶多是半秒钟的功夫。竞赛了，不但要比出数，要比质量好；为了使本组工作好，不但自己好，要使大家都好。有一次，女工张桂珍，看见本组女工王桂珍，接头不按规定法，赶紧跑过去：“你不准对头儿！”虽然王桂珍当时不高兴，但很快就注意改正了。你想，这不是每个工人都成了管工员吗！
    五、竞赛组里又竞赛
    生产竞赛闹起来，车与车组与组看谁比过谁。老车段上一个组，竞赛组里也展开了竞赛。落纱工白兰花、车工李凤金、姚顺起和王大妮等，为了得红旗高过别的车。她们说：“咱们组内赛一赛，谁也保证不跑车、不跑随便茅房、不练疙疸、不旷工，上工要早来，吃饭要快……”。结果这么一来，把一贯生产不积极的老男工冯广顺也带动了起来。
    六、忘记了喝水吃饭
    为了竞赛争红旗，好多工人只吃一顿饭（这种精神很好，但对身体不好，应劝说纠正）。吃饭的工人，很多不去坐着吃，是一面吃，一面车间转。落纱工阎金芬，车上没有挂上旗；回到家里饭也吃不下，觉也睡不着。她母亲还以为她有什么心事呢！车工李桂香，因没有挂上旗，脖子上急起了一个疙疸。管理人员们看到这种情形对她们说：“这样不吃不喝的干可不行哩！”落纱工魏香妮说：“你不知道，我一看车上练了疙疸我就忘记喝水吃饭了”。
    七、干啥也不如竞赛要紧！
    纱厂里头有一块空地方，空气颇凉爽，旁边有开水房，又有冷水管，有地桌，有板凳。竞赛前，工人们，特别是有些女工们，常到那儿偷个懒、撩个天、梳梳头、洗洗脸，特别是梳头，有个别女工更是好几次的梳。梳好照镜子，不好看再梳一回。对生产影响很大，工务部曾写了一个布告，克服这种现象，结果还是没有克服掉。竞赛过程中，这种现象消灭了。工人们说：“咱们是做工来了，梳头洗脸多了，就耽误事”。女工刘桂珍、王大妮等，从上工到下工，身上的花毛如雪，并不去打扫它，好些女工，头发好象变成白色的。一次一个车工，悄悄的在车＠子拿出镜子在梳头上的花毛，落纱工权平金也悄悄地走过去说：“竞赛要紧，别管它好看难看了”！
    八、“你不帮助我，我也帮助你”。
    生产竞赛了，各厂普遍展开了互相帮助的精神，“你帮助我，我也帮助你”。我们这里更出现了新的情形：“你不帮助我，我也帮助你”。就象权平金、张凤娟、张桂珍、田福珍、蔡大妮等等，她们把自己车上工作做好，就常常跑到别的组里帮助接头、上线，你想这种精神会起个什么作用呢？这里我想一定会有工人这样想：“人家跳开组来帮助我，我有什么脸老练疙疸呢”？
    竞赛组中，有一个或两个落纱工，她们领导着这个小组，帮助看车工，车工就把她们看成自己的小领袖一样，偶然上级把落纱工调动一次，那是很难的事情，她们都会喔喔的哭起来，你想这是在解放前有的事吗？你随便走到一个落纱工身边问她。
    “你们组里还有工作差的吗”？
    “还有”。
    “你怎么对待她呢”？
    “说服教育呀”！
    “他要不听呢”？
    “多多的帮助她，她偷懒，我帮忙，人心不是铁打的，总有一天会改正的”。
