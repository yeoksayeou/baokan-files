[Taihang Telegram] In Qinyang's Second District, Xiaoweiying and Xiwan villages, after the land reform concluded, the masses' enthusiasm for production increased. More than 200 men, women, and semi-able-bodied laborers, as well as some children, in Xiaoweiying village organized themselves to weed the wheat and apply top dressing fertilizer, freeing up the full-time male laborers for transportation. The village's oil mill has increased production from two presses of oil per day to three. In order to ensure that participating in production doesn't interfere with work, the cadres discussed and decided that one person would take turns being on duty each day, while other cadres participated in production together with the masses, with a meeting held once in the evening. Currently, the masses in the village have great enthusiasm for production. When they eat together in the evening, they don't talk about anything else. Some plan to exchange small oxen for large oxen, some who don't have oxen want to buy them, some plan to buy pigs and sheep, and others are preparing to build houses, showing a fervent enthusiasm for planning production to build their families. In Xiwan village, 15 women's weaving groups were organized, with 387 people. Since winter production began, they have woven 1,244 bolts of cloth, selling 800 bolts after using some themselves, earning a total of 9.6 million yuan (Jicha). The oil mill has also increased production from two presses of oil per day to three. The entire village has accumulated 8,140 dan of fertilizer, excluding oil cakes, and has already applied over 7,000 dan as top dressing. The entire village is striving to apply 28 dan of fertilizer per mu of wheat. They have also irrigated 4,200 mu of wheat and weeded 6,942 mu of dry and irrigated wheat land. Currently, in the entire Second District, over 30,000 mu of the 40,000 mu of wheat have been weeded, and about 20,000 mu have been top-dressed with fertilizer. In addition, this spring's rainfall has been evenly distributed, and the wheat seedlings are extremely lush and fertile.

[Report from this newspaper] In Jiaohe's Eighth District, Wupan village and other four villages in Jizhong, the people's thinking of getting rich was greatly improved, encouraged by the conclusion of land reform determining land ownership and the great victory of the liberation of Peiping and Tianjin. The sending of manure has been completed, and now they are actively planting hemp. In Xiaowupan village, they finished crushing the manure starting from the twelfth month of last year (lunar calendar). Middle peasant Wu Yuguang and new middle peasant Wu Qinglan began sending manure on the 28th day of the twelfth month of last year and finished on the 29th. Wu Yuqing started sending manure on the second day of the Lunar New Year while the village was performing operas. Someone asked him why he wasn't watching the opera, and he said, "Take advantage of the frozen ground to send it out early, so we can start spring plowing early for the New Year." By the fifth and sixth days, livestock carts in the villages were generally sending manure, and by the 26th day of the first lunar month, except for individual households, all the manure in the four villages had been sent out. They sent it so quickly mainly because they organized cooperative mutual aid, including old ploughing partnerships, joint livestock raising, and temporary mutual aid for pulling manure. Widowers and orphans are helped by neighbors and relatives to send it out. When the village cadres in Zhousi village were busy filling out land certificates during the New Year, the group and close relatives sent out the cadres' manure together, so the village cadres did not delay their work, and the work was not left behind.

Now, the masses in these four villages are planting hemp seeds. Due to the advocacy and leadership of the higher authorities and the masses' personal experience of the benefits of growing more hemp on "pits, ditches, moats, and cliffs," it is expected that the planting area will increase fivefold this year.

　　沁阳西万等村开始锄麦
  　交河吴潘等村点种大麻
    【太行电】沁阳二区校尉营、西万两村，结束土地改革后，群众生产热情提高。校尉营全村男女半劳力及部分儿童二百余人组织起来，进行锄麦与上追肥，腾出男全劳力搞运输。该村油房由每日榨油两槽，现已增至三槽。干部为使参加生产与工作两不耽误，讨论决定每日一人轮流值日，其它干部和群众在一起进行生产，晚上接头一次。目前该村群众生产劲头很大，晚上吃饭到了一块，都不谈别的，有的计划小牛换大牛，有的没牛要买牛，也有的计划要买猪羊，还有的准备盖房，一片计划生产兴家立业热情。西万村组织了妇女纺织十五个组，三百八十七人，在冬季生产以来织布一千二百四十四匹，除自己用了以外，卖了八百匹，共赚洋九百六十万元（冀钞）。油房也同样由每日榨油两槽增至三槽。全村除油饼外，已积肥八千一百四十担，现已上追肥七千余担，全村争取每亩麦要上二十八担肥。并已浇麦四千二百亩，锄水旱地麦六千九百四十二亩。现在全二区四万余亩麦，已锄了三万余亩，已上追肥两万亩左右。加以今春雨水调匀，麦苗极为旺盛肥润。
    【本报讯】冀中交河八区吴潘村等四村，由于结束土地改革确定地权，和平津解放伟大胜利的鼓舞，各阶层人民发家致富的思想大为提高。送粪已经完毕，现在正积极种大麻。小吴潘村从去年腊月（旧历）就把粪捣完。中农吴玉光、新中农吴清兰去年腊月廿八就开始送粪，至廿九日送完。吴玉清在大年初二，本村唱着戏就送起粪来，有人问他为什么连戏也不看，他说：“趁地冻早送出去，过年好早春耕。”至初五、六日，各村的牲口车都普遍送起粪来，至旧历正月二十六日四村除个别户外，其他粪都已送完。他们送得这样快，主要是组织了合作互助，有旧插犋家、伙养牲口和拉粪临时互助等几种形式，鳏寡孤独则有近门当族帮助着送出去。周寺村过年时村干部正忙于填土地证，本组和近族就把干部的粪一同送出去，村干也不误工作，活也作不到后边。
    现在该四村的群众正在种大麻子。由于上级的提倡领导和群众亲自体验到在“坑沟濠崖”上种大麻多收成的好处，预计今年可增种五倍。
