　　Democratic Enterprise Management is an Important Guarantee for Improving Production
    Northeast Daily Editorial
    To run a people's enterprise well, we mainly rely on two things: one is enterprise-based management, and the other is democratic management. The two must be well integrated.
    Regarding the enterprise-based management system, since the Sixth Labor Congress, it has begun to receive attention from various state-owned and public enterprises, and ten systems have been initially planned and implemented in practical work, such as cost accounting, production responsibility system, labor organization, product standards, work standards, mastering technology, and piece-rate bonus, and have gained more or less experience, and improved production efficiency to varying degrees. Although in this regard, we have only taken the first step, and the unification and centralization are still very poor, especially today we still lack a precise and comprehensive production plan, but after all, such a concept has been established in the minds of most comrades: we cannot run a money-losing factory that is unprofitable to the country and the people for a long time, so that our production cannot move forward.
    However, the issue of democratic management has not been universally and seriously valued by the management cadres of our people's enterprises. The concept of democratic management is still very weak or does not exist at all in the minds of some comrades. They have overlooked a fundamental point: the fundamental difference between the management methods of people's enterprises under the New Democracy and the bureaucratic capitalist enterprises, that is, our main reliance is to use democratic methods to promote the initiative and creativity of the workers and masses, so that they can consciously improve production and increase production. In other words, the management of enterprises should adopt democratic methods, and through democratic management methods, deepen and enhance the feeling of workers as masters of the factory and the country, so that everyone can consciously and voluntarily participate in production. The only reliance of bureaucratic capitalist enterprises is strong administrative control—beating, scolding, firing, arresting, and shooting—to achieve their goal of exploiting workers' blood and sweat to obtain huge profits. This cannibalistic management method can only cause workers to passively and actively resist, resulting in behaviors such as shirking, strikes, wasting materials, and damaging machines, which destroy production, and there is no talk of initiative and creativity. We must resolutely change this management method in order to change the old concepts of workers, establish a new labor attitude, and truly promote their labor enthusiasm and work actively.
    Now some enterprise administrative cadres are accustomed to simple administrative orders, lack a mass viewpoint, and regard the factory director's responsibility as "dominating everything." When dealing with any major issues, they not only do not listen to the opinions of the masses, but even do not consult the opinions of the party and trade union leaders, believing that the factory management committee is useless and the trade union is just causing trouble, "Production tasks are urgent, administrative work is busy, and there is no way to pay attention to the work of the trade union." Therefore, they not only do not pay attention to the work of the trade union, do not support the work of the trade union, and even intentionally or unintentionally hinder the work of the trade union, and do not bring major issues related to production to the trade union, to the representative meeting, or to the masses for discussion, so that production and the consciousness of the workers are combined, so that the workers understand why to produce, and how to improve production. But that problem can never be solved by simple administrative orders, these phenomena are absolutely intolerable. It must be recognized that our enterprise management cadres manage the factory on behalf of the country, and first of all, manage the factory on behalf of the working class, and the working class is the most important master of the country. Therefore, we must first rely on the workers and masses to manage production, otherwise it is essentially a manifestation of forgetfulness. We often say that in people's enterprises, the workers and masses are the masters of the factory, then the workers and masses will ask: We have no opportunity to express our opinions on all major issues in the factory, how can we be masters? If the masses do not have the feeling of being masters, how can a master's labor attitude be generated? Because we have been in the rural environment for a long time, it is difficult to train cadres to manage industry. Most of the existing cadres are transferred from the countryside, the army, and government offices. These cadres may have methods and experience in organizing the army, commanding operations, carrying out land reform in the countryside, mobilizing the peasant masses, or carrying out government office work, but they should humbly admit that they are laymen and pupils in terms of managing the most complex industrial production experience and mastering the most scientific industrial technology and industrial knowledge. Therefore, there are still many difficulties in the current industrial construction. And the most important of these difficulties is that the leaders who manage production lack a large number of cadres with such experience and knowledge. Therefore, to overcome the difficulties in the current industrial production and construction, one of the main links is to rely on the broad masses of workers, especially the long-term laboring workers. Rely on their experience and knowledge, promote their initiative and creativity, and work together to do a good job in production. Our administrative cadres must clearly understand their weakness in lacking knowledge of enterprise management, put down the baggage of arrogance and complacency such as "old cadres" and "old experience," humbly learn from the masses, learn the knowledge and experience of the masses, and be good at organizing the initiative of the masses, and believe that the wisdom and creativity of the masses are very great and can overcome all difficulties. For example, in the industrial area near Shenyang, since liberation, the workers and staff have collected materials with great enthusiasm, tried their best to create substitutes, reduce waste, and overcome many difficulties in resuming production. Workers at the HuangguTun Railway Factory broke through various obstacles to revive locomotives and repaired the "Beijing" and "Tianjin" locomotives to welcome the liberation of Beijing and Tianjin. Benxi workers not only overcame the difficulty of not being able to make refractory bricks in winter, but also produced 25% more than during the Kuomintang rule, so that the iron-smelting furnace could be restarted early. There are many such examples. But this kind of initiative of the workers and masses cannot be sustained without a regular democratic management system to guarantee it.
    Of course, the democratic management we are talking about here is completely different from the undisciplined extreme democracy. The specific content of realizing democratic management is to establish factory management committees and employee representative conferences, truly establish the position of the workers and masses as masters of the enterprise, and further promote their enthusiasm and sense of responsibility for caring for the factory and improving production, so that the enterprise-based management and scientific production organization system can be guaranteed by the conscious efforts of the workers and masses.
    In order to overcome the various weaknesses in the current enterprise leadership, the state-owned enterprises in North and South Manchuria should quickly organize and establish factory management committees and employee representative conferences. This is a major task in industrial construction and the labor movement. The factory management committee is the highest authority for unified leadership in the enterprise under the leadership of the higher-level state enterprise organs. In addition to the factory director, engineers, and main persons in charge of production, its members must include an equivalent number of employee representatives elected by the trade union or employee representative conference. Only in this way is it possible to concentrate the opinions of all parties and make correct decisions, and only in this way can the workers' right to participate in enterprise management and their position and role as masters be truly reflected. Since the factory director is the fully authorized representative appointed by the state enterprise organ, he manages the factory on behalf of the people, and first of all manages the factory on behalf of the will of the working class. Therefore, the factory director should be the ex officio chairman of the factory management committee and have the final decision-making power on all major issues related to the factory. However, the use of this final decision-making power does not mean that one can not listen to the opinions of the workers and masses, and that all major issues can be decided independently without consulting with the party and trade union leaders. On the contrary, the factory director should submit all major issues related to the factory, such as production plans, wage adjustments, personnel changes, system reforms, etc., to the management committee and the representative conference for discussion, make appropriate decisions, and then execute them through administrative instructions. Only when the leadership's intentions become the intentions of the masses and the leadership's decisions become the decisions of the masses can the enthusiasm of the masses be highly demonstrated and achieved and exceeded 100%. For example, the Benxi Coal and Iron Company initially mobilized the workers to discuss the production plan and how to overcome the difficulties in resuming production, such as materials, technology, and equipment. As a result, in just a few days, the workers tried their best to collect more than 20 lathes, more than 90 machines, tens of millions of yuan of materials, and hundreds of tons of steel plates and water pipes. This example shows that there are always many difficulties in front of us, but the question is whether our enterprise leaders can be good at humbly learning from the masses, relying on them closely, and improving their class consciousness and enthusiasm. If we can do this, our difficulties can be gradually overcome. Secondly, in order to unify leadership and coordinate the work steps of the administration, the party branch, and the trade union, the standing committee of the factory management committee should be composed of the factory director, the party branch secretary, and the trade union chairman, so as to regularly contact and consult to understand the overall situation and handle major daily problems, so as to overcome the bad phenomenon of each doing its own thing and friction with each other in some enterprises at present. At the same time, it can also prevent the unclear division of labor among the three parties, grasping everything, and the tendency of not establishing their respective organizations to work independently.
    The employee representative conference is the most powerful organizational form under the leadership of the factory management committee that directly contacts the masses, mobilizes the masses, and conveys, discusses, and implements leadership decisions. All enterprises should universally establish and improve it. Especially in the newly liberated industrial areas around Shenyang, before the formal trade union is established, it is not only the best specific organizational form for employees to participate in factory management, but also can be initiated by the employee representative conference to organize the trade union preparatory committee, elect preparatory members, carry out all preparatory work, and undertake the daily work of the trade union, such as developing members, organizing learning, evaluating wages, and running employee welfare and cooperatives.
    The establishment of the factory management committee and the employee representative conference is the specific content of realizing democratic management, that is, transforming the management of the past bureaucratic capitalist enterprises into the management of the new democratic enterprises and establishing the new labor attitude of employees. Our factory directors, managers, and all enterprise management cadres should dare to face up to and overcome our weaknesses, have the courage to get rid of the various viewpoints, experiences, and styles brought from the countryside in the past that are not in line with the realistic requirements, humbly learn from the masses, care for the masses everywhere, and earnestly help the trade union. Spend 51% of your time doing work among workers, listening to the opinions of the workers and masses, that is, find workers' representatives, activists, or experienced old workers to participate in any relatively major problems in talks and meetings. In this way, worker work is done when administrative problems are solved, so that democratic management will not become a formality and its active role will be brought into play. It must be stated here that our emphasis on democratic management does not mean that we do not need systems. On the contrary, to do a good job in production, we must have strict and scientific management systems, but only when the consciousness of the masses is improved will they consciously abide by the systems and oppose the few who undermine the systems. Our emphasis on democratic management does not weaken labor discipline in the slightest. On the contrary, after establishing a new labor attitude, workers will consciously abide by labor discipline, supervise and sanction the few who undermine labor discipline and damage the interests of production, thus damaging the overall interests of the working class. Only when the labor enthusiasm of the masses is created and they consciously strive to improve production can our production continue to move forward, can we complete the great and glorious task of supporting the national liberation war, striving for the rapid arrival of national victory, and building the Northeast Liberated Area as the foundation for the industrialization of the new China.

　　企业管理民主化是改进生产重要的保证
    东北日报社论
    办好一个人民企业，主要依靠两条：一条是企业化的经营，一条是民主化的管理，两者必须很好地结合。
    关于企业化的经营制度，自六次劳动大会以后，已经开始受到各个国营公营企业的注意，并在实际工作中初步规划了十种制度在执行，如成本计算、生产专责制、劳动力组织、产品标准、工作标准、掌握技术、计件超额奖励等，并取得了或多或少的经验，多少提高了生产效率。虽然在这方面，对于我们还仅仅是走了第一步，统一集中还很差，特别是今天我们还缺少一个精密的全面的生产计划，但毕竟是在多数同志中树立了这样一个观念：我们不能长久办一个与国家与人民无利的赔钱的工厂，使我们的生产不能前进一步。
    可是关于管理民主化的问题，还没有普遍地认真地受到我们人民企业管理干部的足够重视，民主管理的观念，在某些同志的心目中还很淡漠，或者根本不存在。他们忽略了基本的一条：新民主主义下的人民企业与官僚资本企业管理方法的根本区别，即我们主要的依靠，是用民主方法来发扬职工群众的积极性创造性，使其自觉地来改进生产提高生产。换句话说，就是企业的管理要采用民主的方法，通过民主管理的方法，来加深与提高工人是工厂与国家主人翁的感觉，使大家能自觉自愿的参加生产。而官僚资本企业唯一的依靠，是强力的行政管制——打骂、开除、逮捕、枪毙，以达到他们剥削工人血汗取得巨额利润的目的，这种吃人的管理方法，自然只能引起工人消极与积极的对抗，因而产生怠上、罢工、浪费材料、损毁机器等破坏生产的行为，根本谈不到积极性与创造性。我们必须坚决改变这种管理方法，才能改变工人的旧观念，树立起新的劳动态度，真正发扬他们的劳动热忱而积极地工作起来。
    现在有些企业行政干部习惯于简单的行政命令，缺少群众观点，把厂长负责任认作是“独霸一切”，处理任何重大问题，不仅不去倾听群众意见，甚至不征询党和工会负责同志的意见，认为工厂管理委员会没有用处，工会只是找麻烦，“生产任务迫切，行政工作忙，无法注意工会工作”，因而不仅不重视工会工作，不支持工会工作，甚至有意无意地阻碍工会工作，不把有关生产的重大问题提到工会中，提到代表会议，提到群众中去讨论，使生产与工人的自觉相结合，使工人懂得为什么要生产，以及如何才能提高生产，而绝不是简单的行政命令就可以解决问题，这些现象是绝不能容忍的。必须认识：我们的企业管理干部，是代表国家来管理工厂，首先是代表工人阶级来管理工厂，而工人阶级即是国家最主要的主人翁，因此首先要依靠工人群众来管理生产，否则实质上即是忘本思想的表现。我们常说在人民企业中，工人群众是工厂的主人翁，那么工人群众要问：我们对工厂中的一切重大问题都没有发表意见的机会，我们怎样作主人呢？试问如果群众没有主人翁的感觉，怎会发生主人翁的劳动态度呢？由于我们已经长期处在农村环境中，很难培养管理工业的干部，现有的干部，绝大多数是从农村、军队、机关转来的，这些干部或者对于组织军队、指挥作战、在农村中进行土地改革、发动农民群众、或在机关中进行机关工作是有办法有经验的，但对于管理最复杂的工业生产的经验，掌握最科学的工业技术与工业知识，则应虚心承认是外行、是小学生，因此在目前工业建设中还存在着不少困难。而困难中之最主要者，即在我们管理生产的领导人，缺乏大批有这样经验、这样知识的干部，因而要克服目前工业生产建设中的困难，其主要环节之一，即是依靠广大职工，首先是长期劳动的工人。依靠他们的经验和知识，发扬他们的积极性与创造性，共同努力来搞好生产。我们的行政干部必须清醒地了解自己缺乏管理企业知识的弱点，把什么“老干部”、“老经验”等一切骄傲自大的包袱放下，虚心向群众学习，学习群众的知识和经验，并善于把群众的积极性组织起来，要相信群众的智慧和创造力是非常伟大可以克服一切困难的。如沈阳附近的工业区，解放以来，职工们以高度热忱，想尽各种办法搜集器材，创制代用品减少浪费，克服了复工生产中的许多困难。皇姑屯铁路工厂工人打破各种阻碍使机车复活，修出北平号天津号火车头，迎接北平天津的解放。本溪工人不仅克服了冬季不能作耐火砖的困难，而且比国民党统治时期多生产百分之二十五，使炼铁炉能提早复工。这类例子很多。但这种工人群众的积极性，如果没有经常的民主管理制度来保证它，是不能持久的。
    当然我们这里所说的管理民主化，与散漫无纪律的极端民主是毫无相同之处的。实现管理民主化的具体内容，就是建立工厂管理委员会、职工代表会议，真正确立职工群众在企业中的主人翁地位，进一步发扬他们爱护工厂改进生产的积极性与责任心，使企业化的经营和科学的生产组织制度得到工人群众自觉努力执行的保证。
    为了克服目前企业领导中的各种弱点，南北满各个国营企业，应迅速组织与建立工厂管理委员会与职工代表会议，这是工业建设与工人运动中一个重大任务。工厂管理委员会是在上级国家企业机关领导下，为企业中统一领导的最高权力机关。它的成员除厂长、工程师及生产中主要负责人外，必须吸收相当于以上数量的工会或职工代表会议选出的职工代表参加。只有这样才有可能集中各方面的意见，作出正确的决定，也才能真正体现出工人参加企业管理的权力，及其主人翁的地位和作用。由于厂长是国家企业机关指派的全权代表，他是代表人民来管理工厂，首先是代表工人阶级的意志来管理工厂，因此厂长应为工厂管理委员会的当然主席，并具有在一切有关工厂重大问题的最后决定权。但这个最后决定权的运用，绝不是说就可以不倾听职工群众的意见，就可以一切重大问题不与党和工会负责人协商而独断独行。恰恰相反，厂长应当把一切有关厂的重大问题，如生产计划、工资调整、人事变动、制度改革等等，提交到管理委员会与代表会议上讨论，作出适当决定，再由行政指令执行。只有当领导意图变为群众的意图，领导的决定变成为群众的决定才能高度发挥群众的积极性，百分之百地实现并超过它。如本溪煤铁公司将生产计划及如何克服复工生产中器材、技术、设备等困难，初步地发动了工人去讨论，结果仅仅几天工夫，工人们想尽办法收集了二十多部车床，九十多件机器，数千万元的器材，几百吨钢板水管子。这个例子说明：在我们前面总有很多困难，但问题在于我们企业领导人能否善于虚心向群众学习，紧紧地依靠他们，提高他们的阶级觉悟与积极性。能够这样做，我们的困难就能逐步克服。其次，为了统一领导协调行政、支部、工会三方面的工作步骤，工厂管理委员会中应由厂长、支部书记、工会主任组成常委会，以便经常联系会商了解全面情况，处理日常较大问题，以克服目前某些企业中各自为政互相磨擦的不良现象。同时也可以防止三方面分工不明确，一把抓，没有适当建立各自组织独立工作的倾向。
    职工代表会议，则是在工厂管理委员会领导下，直接联系群众动员群众传达讨论实现领导决定的最有力的组织形式，各个企业应普遍地把它建立与健全起来，特别在沈阳周围新解放的工业区，在正式工会未建立前，它不仅是职工参加工厂管理的最好的具体组织形式，同时还可由职工代表会议发起组织工会筹备会，选举筹备委员，进行一切筹备工作，并担负起工会日常所作的发展会员、组织学习、评定工资、举办职工福利和合作社等工作。
    工厂管理委员会与职工代表会议的建立，是实现管理民主化的具体内容，也就是将过去官僚资本企业的管理改造成新民主主义企业的管理，树立起职工新的劳动态度。我们的厂长经理及一切企业管理的干部们，应该敢于正视与克服我们的弱点，有勇气摆脱过去从农村中带来不合于现实要求的各种观点经验与作风，虚心地向群众学习，处处关心群众，切实帮助工会，把你们百分之五十一的时间拿出来做工人工作，倾听工人群众的意见，即解决任何比较重大问题的谈话、会议都找工人代表、积极分子或有经验的老年工人来参加，这样在解决行政问题时，就作了工人工作，才能使管理民主化不流于形式，发挥它的积极作用。这里必须说明：我们强调管理民主化，决不是不要制度，相反的，要把生产搞好必须有严密的科学的管理制度，但是只有群众觉悟提高了才会自觉遵守制度，反对那些破坏制度的少数分子。我们强调管理民主化，丝毫不是减弱劳动纪律，相反地，树立了新的劳动态度后，工人会自觉遵守劳动纪律，监督并制裁少数破坏劳动纪律，损害生产利益，则损害工人阶级整体利益的分子。只有造成了群众的劳动热潮，自觉的为提高生产而奋斗，我们的生产才能不断前进，才能完成支援全国解放战争，争取全国胜利迅速到来，把东北解放区建设为奠定新中国工业化基础的巨大而光荣的任务担负起来。　　　　　　　（新华社）
