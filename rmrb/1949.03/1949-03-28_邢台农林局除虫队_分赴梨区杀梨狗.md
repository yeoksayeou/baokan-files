(Taihang News) The Xingtai Agricultural and Forestry Bureau's insect extermination team, consisting of 19 people, went to villages such as Mazhuang in Shahe and Dengjiazhuang in Xingtai on the 14th of this month to kill pear leafroller caterpillars. In twelve villages, including Mazhuang in Shahe, and more than twenty villages, including Dengjiazhuang in the third district of Xingtai, there are densely planted pear trees covering an area of one hundred square li. The pear orchard area in Luoyang Village, Shahe County, reaches 1727.7 mu, accounting for about 10% of the total land area of the village. In past years, pear leafroller caterpillars (pear bugs) have caused great damage. Every spring, when pear trees bud and blossom, preventing and controlling pear bugs becomes the most concerning issue for the masses in these twenty-plus villages. This time, the Xingtai Agricultural and Forestry Bureau's insect extermination team will assist the district and village cadres in organizing insect extermination headquarters to lead the peasants in killing pear bugs. Furthermore, researchers from the Agricultural and Forestry Bureau's research office have also gone to the area with more than ten methods to test the killing of pear bugs, including arsenic lime, tobacco lime, DDT, bitter bark, and clay coating. Once the experiments are successful, they will be widely promoted.
