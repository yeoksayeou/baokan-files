　　Luang Phibunsongkhram—He is the current prime minister of the reactionary Siamese government. In 1938, with the support of Japanese special agents, he became the prime minister of Siam. Domestically, he suppressed the democratic movement and implemented dictatorial rule. Externally, he adopted a pro-Japanese policy, massacring Chinese immigrants. After the outbreak of the Pacific War, Luang Phibunsongkhram colluded with the Japanese invaders, invading Vietnam, Malaya, and Burma. On January 25, 1942, he declared war on the Allied countries. After the Japanese invaders surrendered, American and British imperialism, in order to use the reactionary forces of various countries as pillars for foreign aggression, condoned such a petty accomplice of the aggressive camp as "innocent." In November 1947, Luang Phibunsongkhram, following the intentions of American and British imperialism, launched a coup d'état and seized power. Luang Phibunsongkhram instructed his loyal party member, Apaiwongse (who served as the Siamese traitor prime minister under Japanese rule in 1944-45), to serve as prime minister to deceive the public. Finally, he himself took over as prime minister, serving as a petty accomplice for American and British imperialism in carrying out anti-people's democratic national liberation movements in Southeast Asia.

　　World Bank—Under the guise of "promoting international monetary cooperation and developing post-war international trade," forty-four countries of the United Nations decided to establish the International Monetary Fund Agreement and the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (i.e., the World Bank) at the monetary and financial conference held in "Bretton Woods," USA, from July 1 to 22, 1944. The World Bank was officially announced in March 1946. The World Bank's funds are paid by the shareholder countries in gold and US dollars and are entirely deposited in the United States. The World Bank's voting rights are allocated according to the total amount of share capital, with the United States holding an absolute majority. The first president of the World Bank, Meyer, was appointed by the US government. The current (second) president, McCloy, is also American. The World Bank is actually an auxiliary tool of the Truman Doctrine and the Marshall Plan, and the World Bank's activities are US economic aggression.

　　Export-Import Bank—It is an agency of the United States that carries out foreign economic aggression. Its main business is to carry out foreign loan business on behalf of the United States. These loans are not ordinary commercial loans, but are intended to carry out economic aggression. When applying for loans, it is necessary to first obtain the review of the US National Advisory Council (chaired by the Secretary of the Treasury, with the Secretary of State, Secretary of Commerce, Chairman of the Export-Import Bank, and Chairman of the Federal Reserve Board as members), considering whether these loans can be exchanged for airports, naval bases, military resources, and other advisory and supervisory rights, etc., before deciding whether to lend. Before the establishment of the World Bank, the Export-Import Bank had acted as an agent for the "World Bank's" business.

    銮披汶——是现在暹维反动政府的总理，一九三八年，他在日本特务支持下当了暹维的首相，对内镇压民主运动，实行独裁统治；对外采取亲日政策，屠杀中国侨民，太平洋战争爆发后，銮披汶就勾结日寇，进兵侵略越南，马来亚及缅甸，并于一九四二年一月二十五日向盟国宣战。日寇投降后，美英帝国主义因为要利用各国反动势力，作为向外侵略的支柱，所以就纵容了这样一个侵略阵营的小走卒“无罪”。一九四七年十一月，銮披汶即仰承了美英帝国主义的这种意旨，以发动政变而窃取了政权。銮披汶指使他的忠实党徒阿拜温（在一九四四——四五年曾任日寇统治下的暹奸总理）。当了总理，以掩人耳目，最后，他自己出任了总理，担任着美英帝国主义在东南亚实行反人民民主民族解放运动的小走卒。
    世界银行——联合国的四十四个国家在“提倡国际货币合作，发展战后国际贸易”的美名下，于一九四四年七月一日至二十二日，在美国“布里顿森林”地方举行的货币金融会议上，决定成立了国际货币基金协定与世界复兴建设银行（就是世界银行），到一九四六年三月世界银行即正式宣布成立。世界银行的资金，是由各股东国家缴出黄金、美金，完全放存于美国；世界银行的表决权是根据股本总额分配的，美国掌握了绝对的多数。世界银行的第一任行长梅育，是美国政府委派的。现在（第二任）的行长麦克劳，还是美国的。世界银行实际上就是杜鲁门主义、马歇尔计划的附属工具，世界银行的活动，就是美国经济侵略的活动。
    出入口银行——是美国实行对外经济侵略的机构，主要业务就是代表美国实行对外贷款业务，这些贷款不是普通商业性的，而是为了实行经济侵略，申请贷款时，必须先获得美国全国顾问局（是以财政部长为主席，国务卿、商务部长、出入口银行董事长、联邦准备局理事长为委员）的审查，考虑到这些贷款中是否可以换得飞机场、海军基地、军事资源，及其他顾问权与监督权等等，然后才决定是否贷给。在世界银行未成立前，出入口银行曾代办过“世界银行”的业务。
