　　Purge Bourgeois Ideological Influences
　　Strengthen Proletarian Artistic Viewpoints
    However, in the past year's theatrical creation, there have also been biases, that is, in some dramas or individual drama workers, they have not completely broken away from the influence of the bourgeoisie, or are unconsciously dominated by it, thus producing incorrect technical viewpoints, formalism, objectivism and other biases. For example, some theater troupes emphasize that they come from the countryside and are not familiar with the troops, and mistakenly believe that "the life of soldiers is monotonous and the stage appearance is not good-looking and difficult to write." This is a non-proletarian artistic viewpoint that has been criticized very early on. Those who maintain this view are blind to the great struggle with rich colors and the various heroic figures who complete this undertaking, as well as their high degree of class consciousness, their collectivism, and the growth of their new qualities. They also lack sufficient knowledge on the issue of language, and some people use vulgar colloquialisms such as "damn it" to represent the mass language of soldiers. Some simply pursue fun, reducing the political and ideological nature of the drama. Some do not analyze or criticize things, but list phenomena, making it impossible for the audience to correctly understand the essence of the People's Liberation Army. In terms of praising heroic models, they emphasize that "life has shortcomings," and write the shortcomings of the characters as reasonable existences without serious correction, making it seem that the shortcomings of heroes are also worth praising, which is in line with the psychology of individual backward elements and has a negative effect objectively. In order to "express" or "highlight" heroic figures, the "hero's" comrades are written as greedy for life and afraid of death, wavering and hesitant, foolish and ignorant, forming an unrealistic and isolated personal hero, which is contrary to the collectivist line in the People's Liberation Army. There are also comrades who use old concepts to replace the new reality. When criticizing a cadre, they do not focus on analyzing his ideological essence, nor do they focus on showing his transformation process, but mistakenly emphasize that his origin is through the land revolution, creating a wrong understanding of veteran cadres and the land revolution. In terms of transforming liberated soldiers, instead of educating them with a sincere and serious attitude about their temporary backwardness, they are depicted as comical caricatures and ridiculed. Without distinction, all lower-level officers and lower-level civil servants of the Kuomintang are negated, directly violating the policies of the Communist Party. Furthermore, a very small number of comrades have the idea of "becoming famous" and fantasize about "making a splash," but are unwilling to make timely reflections on many vivid and practical things.
    All these shortcomings reflect that some drama work cadres still lack a strict class viewpoint, are not good at grasping the ideological methods of Marxism-Leninism, and are not familiar with various revolutionary policies. Therefore, in order to improve the drama work after the revolution on the existing basis, so as to better adapt to the needs of the current situation, the meeting specially put forward the issue of learning, learning Marxism-Leninism, linking theory with practice, learning policies, checking work at any time, summarizing experience, strengthening ideological leadership, and improving theoretical level, and establishing close ties between various theater troupes and propaganda teams, and exchanging opinions at any time.
    The meeting determined that in the future, the most important theme in creation should be to sing the praises of the light of the revolution. In the newly liberated cities, it should reflect the implementation of the People's Liberation Army's policies on the city, reflect the awakening of the broad masses of the working people, and reflect how they unite around the Communist Party to jointly participate in democratic construction. The second is to criticize the backward ideas that hinder their progress, which is self-criticism of the revolutionary camp and should be completely well-intentioned. As for the enemy, we must ruthlessly expose the dark rule and collapse of the Kuomintang. In terms of troop work, it should focus on reflecting the heroic struggle of the soldiers, singing the praises of their collective heroism, singing the praises of their creativity and wisdom, and singing the praises of the growth of their new character and new qualities. Under this guiding principle, we should integrate the writing of real people and real events with the improvement of typical examples. We must combine rough, small-scale forms with relatively complete, large-scale dramas, but the former must be the main focus. Because small forms can reflect reality in a timely manner and promote movements. Once this type of work is processed, enriched, revised, and concentrated, it can produce more universal typical examples. Only by producing a large number of works depicting real people and real events can we be more likely to produce more complete typical examples and achieve great results.

### 清算资产阶级思想影响　加强无产阶级艺术观点

　　清算资产阶级思想影响
  　加强无产阶级艺术观点
    但是过去一年的戏剧创作中，却也存在着偏向，即在部分戏剧中或个别戏剧工作者中仍未完全摆脱资产阶级的影响，或不自觉地受其支配，因此产生了不正确的技术观点、形式主义、客观主义等偏向。如有的剧团强调由农村来，不熟悉部队，并错误地认为“战士生活色彩单调，舞台面不好看，不好写”。这是曾经很早就批判过的非无产阶级的艺术观点。保持这种观点的人，对于目前有丰富色彩的伟大斗争事业与完成这事业的各样英雄人物，及他们高度的阶级觉悟，他们的集体主义，他们的新品质的成长，是熟视无睹的。在语言问题上也缺乏足够的知识，有些人用“他妈的”等庸俗化的口语，作为代表战士的群众语言。有的则单纯追求趣味，减低了戏剧的政治性、思想性。有的对事物不分析，不批判，罗列现象，使观众不能正确地认识解放军的本质。在表扬英雄模范方面，强调“人生就有缺点”，便把剧中人的缺点写成为合理的存在，不加以严肃的纠正，令人看起来似乎英雄的缺点也是值得表扬的，这正符合个别落后分子的心理，在客观上起了消极的作用。为了“表现”或“烘托”英雄人物，把这个“英雄”的战友们都写成贪生怕死、动摇犹豫、愚味无知，形成不现实的、孤立的个人英雄，这与解放军中的集体主义路线是背道而驰的。也有这样的同志，他用陈旧的概念来代替新的现实，当批评一个干部时，不着重分析其思想本质，不着重表现其改造过程，而错误地强调他的出身是经过土地革命，造成对于老干部和土地革命的错误认识。在改造解放战士方面，对于他们一时的落后，不是以诚恳的、严正的态度进行教育，而是把他们描绘成滑稽的漫画形式，加以嘲笑。对于国民党的下级军官、下级公务人员，不加分别，一律否定，直接违反了共产党政策。更有极少数的同志存在“成名”思想，幻想“一鸣惊人”，而对于许多生动的实际事物，不愿意作及时的反映。
    所有这些缺点，反映了一部分戏剧工作干部，还缺乏严格的阶级观点，不善于掌握马列主义的思想方法，不熟悉各项革命政策。因此，为了革命后的戏剧工作，在现有基础上提高一步，以求更能适应目前形势开展的需要，会议上特别提出了学习问题，提出了学习马列主义，联系实际，学习政策，随时检查工作，总结经验，加强思想领导，提高理论水平，并在各剧团、宣传队之间建立密切的联系，随时交换意见的问题。
    会上确定：今后在创造方面应以歌颂革命的光明作为最重要的主题。在新解放的城市中，应反映解放军对城市政策的实施，反映广大劳动人民的觉悟，反映他们如何团结在共产党周围共同参加民主建设。其次是批评那些阻碍自己进步的落后思想，这是对革命阵营的自我批评，应当是完全善意的。至于对敌人，那就要无情地暴露国民党的黑暗统治及其崩溃。在部队工作方面，则应以反映战士的英勇斗争为主，歌颂他们的集体英雄主义，歌颂他们的创造和智慧，歌颂他们新性格、新品质的成长。在这一个方针下，应该把写真人、真事与提高典型互相配合起来。要把较粗糙的小型式与较完整的大型剧配合起来，但必须以前者为主。因为小形式能及时地反映现实，推动运动，这一类作品，一经加工，充实修改、集中，即可产生更有普遍性的典型。只有大量产生描写真人、真事的作品，才更有可能产生较完整的典型，收伟大的效果。
