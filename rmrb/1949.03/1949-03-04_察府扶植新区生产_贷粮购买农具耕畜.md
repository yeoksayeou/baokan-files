　　The Chahar Government Supports New District Production
  　Loans of Grain to Purchase Farm Tools and Livestock
    [Zhangjiakou Electric] The Chahar Provincial Government allocated 150,000 catties of production loan grain on February 23 to support the people in the newly liberated Hebei-Chahar disaster area in purchasing livestock and farm tools. The Hebei-Chahar area includes eight counties, which had been devastated by the Japanese invaders' Three Alls Policy for more than ten years. More than 200 villages were once turned into "no-man's-lands." After our army liberated the area from 1945 to 1946, the people's lives had just begun to improve during a year of production and construction. In October 1946, after the Chiang Kai-shek bandits occupied the area, the bandits created and expanded the "no-man's-lands" there, plundering all livestock, grain, and farm tools. Coupled with wind, hail, water, and disease disasters, a serious catastrophe was caused, with as many as 350,000 mu of wasteland, accounting for one-tenth of the total land area of the Hebei-Chahar area. The disaster situation in more than 250 villages in the Changshun area is particularly unprecedented in history. Now the democratic government is vigorously leading and supporting the local people to restore and rebuild their homes.

　　察府扶植新区生产
  　贷粮购买农具耕畜
    【张垣电】察哈尔省政府于二月廿三日拨发生产贷粮十五万斤，扶植新解放的冀察灾区人民购买耕畜和农具。冀察区包括八个县，十余年来，曾经过日寇三光政策的摧残，一度变为“无人区”的村庄即达二百多个，一九四五年至一九四六年在我军解放后，一年生产建设中，人民生活刚见一点起色，到一九四六年十月，蒋匪侵占该地区后，匪徒们又在那里制造和扩大了“无人区”，牲口、粮食、农具皆被抢掠一空，加上风、雹、水、病灾害造成了严重的浩劫，荒地即有三十五万亩之多，占冀察区总土地面积的十分之一，昌顺一带二百五十多个村庄灾情之重，尤为历史上所未有。现在民主政府正在大力领导与扶植当地人民恢复与再建自己的家园。
