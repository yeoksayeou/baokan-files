　　Laying the Foundation for Future Household Registration Work
    Tianjin Implements Universal Household Registration Sealing
    [Tianjin Electric] The re-verification and establishment of household registration in Tianjin is being carried out universally. It is expected that this work will be completed in mid-April. Before the census work began, some districts selected key streets, concentrating all household registration personnel in the district to conduct verification, drawing experience from it to guide the census work in each street. The objectives of the verification are statistics on population emigration, immigration, births, deaths, unregistered individuals, unregistered households (i.e., people and households not in the household register), occupations, etc., and at the same time, investigate various industries and social conditions to lay the foundation for future household registration work. During the key verification of twelve streets in the Fourth District, in addition to making precise statistics on population, occupations, housing, vehicles, livestock, etc., 160 people were found to be without household registration, with mismatched ages, Kuomintang stragglers, unregistered reactionary party members, and thieves' dens. They were all quickly educated and appropriately dealt with. Before liberation, the reactionary Kuomintang government often used household registration inspections to carry out atrocities such as conscription, forced recruitment, extortion, and blackmail, which made citizens deeply fearful of household registration investigations. Coupled with years of deceptive propaganda, some people still had many doubts during this verification. During the household registration verification in the First District, it was discovered that some people falsely reported their ages, and some young people did not register their households. After patient education and explanation by the People's Government, citizens' views have gradually changed.

　　为今后户政工作奠定基础
    津市普遍查封户口
    【天津电】天津市户籍户政的重新查对与建立工作已普遍进行。此项工作预计可于四月中旬全部完成。有些区在普查工作进行以前，曾选择重点街，集中全区所有户政人员，进行查对，从中吸取经验，指导各街普查工作。查对的目标为人口的迁出、迁入、出生、死亡、黑人、黑户（即不在户籍的人户），职业等统计，并同时调查各行业及社会情况，为今后户政工作奠定基础。四区在十二街进行重点查对时，除对人口、职业、房屋、车辆、牲畜等作了精密的统计外，并查出无户口、年龄不符、国民党散兵、未登记的反动党团分子及窃盗窝贼等一百六十人，均迅速分别进行了教育，做了适当的处理。解放前，国民党反动政府经常通过户口检查，进行抓兵、征兵、勒索、敲诈等暴行，使市民对调查户口深感恐惧，加以多年来欺骗的宣传，因之此次查对时，有些人依然存有许多疑虑。一区在查对户口时，发现有人虚报年岁，还有的青年不报户口。经人民政府耐心教育解释，市民的看法现已逐渐转变。
