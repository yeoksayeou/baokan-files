　　The Ping Municipal Military Control Commission Creates Experience in Taking Over Large Cities During Material Takeover
　　[Our Newspaper] The Ping Municipal Military Control Commission has initially completed the material takeover work, creating many new experiences in taking over large cities. The commission's material takeover work began on February 3rd and ended on the 13th of this month. It has taken over 711 units in Beiping, including the pseudo-Kuomintang, military and political, financial, logistics, health, telecommunications, and real estate industries, with more than 62,400 personnel. Throughout the entire takeover process, the CCP Central Committee's urban policy and takeover discipline were strictly implemented and carried out. So far, only a dozen violations of takeover discipline (unauthorized use of materials without the commission's approval) have occurred, and the commission's Material Takeover Committee has issued a notice of criticism. The commission's material takeover work has been praised by the broad masses of workers, students, and citizens of Beiping. The entire material takeover work is divided into two parts: outside the city and inside the city. The takeover work outside the city was carried out under war conditions, while the takeover work inside the city was carried out under a situation of partial peaceful liberation. This includes two types of large-city takeover work: war takeover and peaceful takeover. The commission organized a Material Takeover Committee to unify leadership and control the entire material takeover. The Material Takeover Committee has seven departments: Military and Political, Financial, Logistics, Health, Telecommunications, Transportation, and Real Estate, each responsible for taking over the relevant departments.
　　In the past month or so, the commission has gained the following experience in the takeover work: First, it can use two different takeover methods to carry out the takeover according to two different situations: war takeover and peaceful takeover. When the commission took over materials outside Beiping City, the takeover staff closely followed the field army's actions, and wherever the troops fought, they went there to carry out the takeover work, quickly taking over important enterprises such as the Changxindian Railway Factory and the Shijingshan Power Plant, preventing anarchy and disorganization, and quickly organizing the resumption of work. Later, Beiping was peacefully liberated, and the "Beiping Joint Office" was used to carry out the takeover work. First, the Military Control Commission proposed the takeover target, or General Fu Zuoyi's representative of the "Joint Office" proposed the units to be handed over. After discussion and approval by the representatives of both parties of the "Joint Office," a takeover notice was issued to the unit to be taken over, and the Military Control Commission sent a military representative to carry out the takeover. The "Beiping Joint Office," under the command of the PLA Pingjin Front Command, created many conveniences for the takeover work. (Picture attached)

### 平市军管会在物资接管中　创造接管大城市经验

　　平市军管会在物资接管中
  　创造接管大城市经验
    【本报讯】北平市军管会已初步完成了物资接管工作，创造了许多接管大城市的新经验，该会的物资接管工作从二月三日开始进行，到本月十三日止，已共接管了北平市伪国民党、军政、财经、后勤、卫生、电讯、房地产业等七百十一个单位，六万二千四百余名人员。整个接管过程中，严格执行与贯彻了中共中央的城市政策和接管纪律，迄今为止，仅发生了十余件违反接管纪律（未经该会批准擅自动用物资）的行为，已经该会所属的物资接管委员会通告批评。该会的物资接管工作，得到了北平市广大工人、学生和市民的赞许。整个物资接管工作分为城外与城内两部份，城外的接管工作是在战争状态下进行的；而城内的接管工作，则是在局部和平解放的局面下进行的。这是包括战争接管与和平接管两种类型的大城市接管工作。该会组织了一个物资接管委员会，统一领导掌握整个物资接管，物管会共设军政、财经、后勤、卫生、电讯、交通、房地产业七部，分工负责接管各该有关部门。
    一个多月以来，该会在接管工作中，获得如下经验：第一是能根据战争接管与和平接管两种不同的情况，分别用两种接管方式，进行接管。该会接管北平城外物资时，接管工作人员紧随野战军行动，部队打到哪里，即到那里进行接管工作，迅速接管了长辛店铁路工厂、石景山发电厂等重要企业，防止了无政府无组织现象，并且能迅速组织复工。其后，北平和平解放，又经过“北平联合办事处”去进行接管工作，先由军管会提出接管对象，或由“联办”傅作义将军代表提出移交单位，经“联办”双方代表商讨通过，发出接管通知书给被接管单位，办理交代，由军管会派出军事代表进行接管，“北平联办”在解放军平津前线司令部指挥之下，对接管工作造成很多便利。（附图片）
