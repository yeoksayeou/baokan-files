　　Please Ban Pornographic Books
　　Establish Covered Garbage Bins
　　I have three suggestions:
　　One, the standard clocks on major roads are often inaccurate and sometimes stop. There should be a dedicated person responsible for managing them, and I hope the relevant authorities will pay attention.
　　Two, there are many novel stalls in Xidan and other places, mostly selling chaotic and obscene books, which are too toxic to young people. These books are also useless to children, so education should be conducted to guide readers to read beneficial revolutionary books and ban obscene books.
　　Three, spring is the season for fly growth. Covered garbage bins (brick and earth, one for every three households) should be built in alleys and streets. The sanitation workers should collect the garbage every morning. This is beneficial to everyone's health and can eliminate the breeding of mosquitoes and flies.

### 请禁卖淫书　建立带盖垃圾箱

专栏：

　　请禁卖淫书
  　建立带盖垃圾箱
            我有三点建议：
    一、各要路之标准钟快慢不准并有时还站住。应当有专人负责管理，望有关机关注意。
    二、西单及其他地方有许多小说书摊，多为乱书淫史，对青年毒素太大。这些书对儿童亦无益，应进行教育，引导读者去读有益的革命书籍，取缔淫书。
    三、春季是蝇子生长的季节，各胡同街巷应砌成带盖垃圾箱（砖土质，每三门设一个），每日早晨由清洁夫收走。对每人卫生有益，能消灭蚊蝇滋长。
