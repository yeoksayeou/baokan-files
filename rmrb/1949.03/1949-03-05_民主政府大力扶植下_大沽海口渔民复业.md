　　With Strong Support from the Democratic Government,
  　Fishermen in Dagu Estuary Resume Work
    [Tianjin Telegraph] With the help of the People's Government, the fishery industry in Dagu Estuary has resumed production. The fishery area includes Yujia Village in Donggu and Xigu, with a total of 1,017 fishing households and 3,489 fishermen (including 401 hired fishermen). In the past, the annual production of shrimp reached over 9.4 million catties, and fish over 3.5 million catties. In addition, the output of noodles fish, marinated fish and other products was also high. During the Kuomintang rule, tax checkpoints were specially set up in Dagu, with taxes levied by the four committees, and as many as eleven or twelve kinds of exorbitant taxes and levies were imposed. Even the "ship repair fees" of the Chiang Kai-shek bandit navy were apportioned to the fishermen. The puppet Fishery Association also took the opportunity to issue certificates and extorted 200 catties of corn flour from fishermen every year, and 300 catties from larger ships. Before the bandit troops fled, they looted almost all the stored grain from the households, and 19 larger fishing boats were also destroyed, causing great difficulties for fishermen to go to sea this spring. After the liberation of Tanggu and Dagu, the People's Government sent personnel to hold forums with fishermen, calling on them to step up production, and announced the abolition of the puppet Fishery Association and the puppet Baojia organization used by the Kuomintang to rule the fishermen. The 401 hired fishermen have formally established a temporary Fishermen's Representatives Conference, and have formed 61 fishermen's groups by region. Fishermen and shipowners have also formed a temporary Fishery Committee. The People's Government also issued 18,000 catties of food grain according to the grain shortage of each household, so that the fishermen could maintain their food consumption for ten to fifteen days at sea. At the same time, the Tangda Office of the People's Bank issued fishery loans to help fishermen repair fishing boats and replenish fishing gear. At present, 389 fishing boats (and another 186 transport ships) in the whole area have been mostly repaired and prepared with half a month's worth of grain, and have successively gone to sea in early February. Forty-four fish shops are also preparing to resume business. Three fishing boats, including Han Guoming's family in Yujia Village, caught 5,100 catties of green shrimp in seven days.

　　民主政府大力扶植下
  　大沽海口渔民复业
    【天津电】大沽海口渔业在人民政府扶助下已恢复生产。该区渔业包括东沽西沽渔家村等，共有渔户一千零一十七户，渔民三千四百八十九人（内有被雇用的渔工四百零一人），过去每年产虾类达九百四十余万斤，鱼类三百五十余万斤，另外面条鱼、卤鱼等产量亦多。国民党统治时期，在大沽专设税卡，按四委抽税，苛杂摊派多达十一、二种，甚至蒋匪海军“修舰费”也摊到渔民身上。伪渔业公会也借着开给证明，向渔民每年勒索玉米面二百斤，大船则索三百斤。匪军逃窜前，将各户存粮几抢一空，较大渔船十九只亦被破坏，造成今春渔民下海很大的困难。塘沽、大沽解放后，人民政府派员分头召开渔民座谈会，号召渔民加紧生产，并宣布取消国民党用以统治渔民的伪渔业公会及伪保甲组织，四百零一名渔工已正式建立临时渔工代表会，并按地区组成六十一个渔工小组，渔工及船主也组成了临时渔业委员会。人民政府并按照各户缺粮情形，贷发食粮一万八千斤，使渔民可以维持十天至十五天的下海食用。同时由人民银行塘大办事处发放渔业贷款，帮助渔民修理渔船，填补渔具。现全区下海渔船三百八十九只（另有运输船一百八十六只）已大部修理完毕，备好半月存粮，于二月初陆续下海，四十四家鱼店亦准备复业。渔家村韩国明等三个渔船，来去七天，即捕青虾五千一百斤。
