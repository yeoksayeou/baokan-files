　　Worker Sun Wenbin Transforms Copper Nail Mold
    [Changzhi News] Sun Wenbin, a worker at the state-owned Junji Factory, successfully transformed the copper nail mold used on military pots. Previously, one person could make 200 nails a day, but now they can make 600, increasing efficiency by two times, and the nails produced are very uniform. He also successfully made iron-shearing scissors from steel bow plates from automobiles. Previously, cutting the mouth of military pots (what workers call the "li kou") required two people to cut a maximum of fifteen per day, but now one person can cut twenty per day, increasing production efficiency by more than one and a half times. Moreover, in the past, an average of one pair of scissors (valued at 200 yuan) would break for every twenty pots made. This also saves on the expense of scissors consumption. If labor savings are included in the statistics, the cost can be reduced by 22.5 yuan per pot, saving a pot-making worker 450 yuan per day. (Jia Xuewen)

　　工人孙文彬改造铜钉模
    【长治讯】公营军记工厂工人孙文彬，改造军用锅上的铜钉模子成功。以前一人一天做二百个，现在能做六百个，提高效率两倍，并且做出来很规矩。他又把汽车上的钢弓板造成剪铁的剪子，也成功了。以前剪军锅口（工人叫立口），两个人一天最多剪十五口，现在一人一天能剪二十口，提高生产效率一倍半还多。并且，过去平均做二十口锅就坏一把剪子（一把剪子以二百元计），这样又节省了剪子消耗开支，如连节省人力统计，每口锅可减低成本二十二元五角，一个做锅工人一天就节省四百五十元。（贾学文）
