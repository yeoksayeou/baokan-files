Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 26th: Facing the great review of the world's people's peaceful forces, the US imperialists have shown fear and panic. According to TASS, the US State Department announced that it would refuse to issue passports to representatives from Britain, France, Italy, Brazil, Romania, and other countries who were invited to attend the New York Peace Conference. Shapley, the organizer of the New York Peace Conference and chairman of the National Council of Arts, Sciences, and Professions in the United States, has lodged a serious protest with US Secretary of State Acheson. The committee also issued a statement, denouncing the US State Department's action as an attempt to obliterate the fact that cultural leaders with various political beliefs around the world support this international conference that contributes to the long-term peace desired by the world's people. The statement pointed out that the Peace Conference has continuously received telegrams from Europe, Asia, and Latin America supporting the conference. The American Slavic Congress also issued a similar statement to express its protest and welcomed delegations from the Soviet Union, Poland, and other countries. Among the foreign representatives who were refused passports by the US State Department were Mrs. Gordon, Chairman of the Women's International Democratic Federation, the world-renowned French poet Paul Éluard, Brazilian painter Portinari, British writer Golding, physicist Bernal, and others. This unreasonable behavior of the US government has aroused extreme indignation among the British and French people. Progressive figures in France, including the famous scientists the Curies and the poets the Aragons, have jointly protested to the US Embassy in France. Many British members of parliament and scholars, including Pritt, have also signed letters to US Ambassador to the UK Douglas, requesting him to urge the US government to issue visas. The letter severely criticized the refusal to issue passports as a serious harm to the cause of peace, to the principles of freedom of expression and action for individuals, and to the relations between the American and British people. The British Daily Worker also published an article criticizing the reactionary measure of the US State Department, pointing out that it was afraid that the British and American people would unite and reach a consensus in the common political direction of striving for peace.

　　面对世界人民力量大检阅
  　美帝惊惶！
    【新华社北平二十六日电】美帝国主义者在全世界人民和平力量大检阅面前，表现了恐惧和惊惶。据塔斯社消息，美国国务院宣布对于应邀赴美参加纽约和平大会的英、法、意、巴西、罗马尼亚等国代表拒绝签发护照。纽约和平大会组织者、美国艺术、科学、职业全国委员会主席沙普莱为此已向美国务卿艾奇逊提出严重抗议。该委员会并发表声明，指斥美国务院这一行动是企图抹煞下一事实：即全世界具有各种政治信仰的文化界领袖都拥护这一世界人民热望的对持久和平有贡献的国际会议。声明指出：和平大会连续收到欧洲、亚洲与拉丁美洲各地发来支持大会的电文。美籍斯拉夫人大会亦发表同样声明表示抗议，并对苏联、波兰与其他各国代表团表示欢迎。被美国国务院拒发护照的外国代表中包括国际民主妇女联合会主席戈登夫人与世界著名的法国诗人艾吕霞、巴西画家波登纳里、英国作家古尔丁、物理学家伯纳尔等。美国政府这一无理行为，已引起英法人民的极度愤慨，法国进步人士包括著名科学家居里夫妇，诗人阿拉贡夫妇等已联名向美国驻法大使馆提出抗议。许多英国议员和学者包括普烈特等也签名写信给美驻英大使道格拉斯要求促使美国政府发出签证。信中严斥拒发护照是对和平事业，对个人表达意见与行动自由的原则以及对美英人民关系的严重危害。英国工人日报亦撰论斥责美国国务院的反动派这一措施，指出这是惧怕英美人民团结起来，而在争取和平的共同政治方向中达成一致决定。
