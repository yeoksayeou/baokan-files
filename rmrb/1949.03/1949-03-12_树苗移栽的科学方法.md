　　Scientific Methods for Transplanting Seedlings
    [This newspaper report] Comrade Zhan Qin reported on the scientific method of transplanting seedlings: (1) The bark of each tree facing the sun is thicker and generally grayish-black; the opposite side is the opposite, and the bark color is lighter. Therefore, when transplanting seedlings, it is important to remember to plant them according to their original position, which makes it easier for them to survive. (2) Do not damage the fine roots during transplantation. If transplanting larger seedlings, dig trenches on three sides of the roots in the first year, about two feet deep, and the distance between the trenches and the roots should be about two feet five inches. Wait until the fine roots gather into a ball next year before transplanting. The reason for digging trenches is to promote the growth and aggregation of fine roots, so that they will not die after transplantation the following year. (3) Before transplanting, prepare the planting pit first. The depth, length and width of the pit depends on the size of the seedling. After the pit is dug, add a layer of weathered soil (hot soil) underneath, and then pour water to about half the depth of the pit. After the water penetrates, then insert the seedlings. (4) Pay attention to the original direction of the seedlings when inserting them. After covering the roots with soil, gently lift the seedlings upwards slowly with your hands to stretch the fine roots, so that they can fully absorb water and nutrients. Then compact the soil and water again. (5) After the seedlings are transplanted, the branches should be pruned, because the fine roots of the seedlings will inevitably be damaged after a move. The initial period after transplantation is the time when the fine roots are recovering to their original state, and the ability to absorb water is very weak. At this time, a small part of the small branches and young leaves should be cut off, or the top should be cut off. Otherwise, the leaves will evaporate too much water and will slowly wither and die. Generally, the old folks are not used to pruning branches, and some cherish the lush branches and leaves and are reluctant to prune them, which often leads to the death of the seedlings.

　　树苗移栽的科学方法
    【本报讯】詹勤同志报导移植树苗的科学方法：（一）每棵树向太阳的皮都较厚，一般发灰黑色；背面却相反，皮色较淡。所以移植树苗时，要紧记按原位置栽，这样容易活。（二）移植时，切勿损伤毛根，如移植较大的树苗时，在头一年先将树根之三面掘沟，深约二尺，其沟距树根约二尺五寸远，待明年毛根盘聚一团，再行移植。掘沟之原因，是促进毛根的生长团聚性，次年移植后，不致于死亡。（三）在未移植时，先要准备掘坑。坑之深浅与长阔，看树苗的大小而定，将坑掘好后，下面须加一层风化土（热土），然后灌水约半坑深，待水渗透后，再行插苗。（四）插苗时要注意树苗的原方向，用土盖好根后，用手将树苗慢慢向上稍提，使毛根舒展，就能充分的吸收水分与养料，然后将土踏实，再灌水。（五）将树苗移植好以后，就应该剪枝，因树苗经过一番移动，毛根不免有损失，初移植后，毛根正是恢复原来状态的时期，对于吸收水分的劲头儿很薄弱，此时应当剪去少部分的细枝嫩叶，或者将顶部剪去，要不，叶子蒸发水分过多，就会慢慢枯干死。一般老乡们，不习惯剪枝，有的怜惜枝叶的繁茂，舍不得剪枝，这样往往树苗枯死。
