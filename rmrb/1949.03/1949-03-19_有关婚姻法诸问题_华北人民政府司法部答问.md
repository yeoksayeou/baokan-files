　　Questions Concerning Marriage Law
　　Reply from the Justice Department of the North China People's Government

Editor:
    In the "Inquiry and Reply" column of the January 19th People's Daily, I saw the harms of early marriage, and also the regulations setting the marriageable age at 20 for men and 18 for women. However, the former Jinji-Luyu area stipulated 18 for men and 16 for women. In 1937, when I worked in Dongguan, Lincheng, I saw that Fan Shuangting, 15, and Li Xiaosi, 18, got married and had a good relationship. Are they legal since they are underage? (Qiao Yuqing, First Special District of Taihang)

    Answer: (1) Currently, the regulations regarding marriageable age have not been unified. The former Jin-Cha-Ji area stipulated 20 for men and 18 for women. The former Jin-Ji-Yu-Lu area stipulated 18 for men and 16 for women. Before a unified regulation is announced, each area will handle matters according to its existing regulations.
    (2) The legal marriage age is correct. As for individual cases where people below the marriageable age have voluntarily married, and their relationship is good, and the government did not educate or correct them beforehand, there is no need to break them up after the fact on the grounds of illegality.

Editor:
    (1) In Zhaibei and Huikou villages, there is a couple, both 14 or 15 years old. Due to family difficulties, they went to the government to ask for permission to marry, but the government refused. Is this correct?
    (2) Huo Fubao of Chenjia Yuan Village was captured by the enemy during the enemy's sweep in July of the 30th year of the Republic of China (1941) and has been missing for seven years. His wife, Su Xiuting, remarried Li ShuanShuan in Xiaobeitou Village in the 34th year of the Republic of China (1945) and has been married for more than three years. Last November, Huo Fubao's father called back Jiang Fubao from Shanxi. Now Huo Fubao and Su Xiuting have a dispute, but Su Xiuting insists on not returning to Huo Fubao's family. How should this matter be resolved?
　　Feng Lan, Ninth District, PingShan County

    Answer: (1) Men and women who have not reached the marriageable age cannot marry. The local government's handling of the marriage issue in Zhaibei and Huikou villages is correct. The law stipulates marriageable age because marriage before maturity is harmful to the body, and the children born are also unhealthy. For the sake of one's own health and that of future generations, early marriage should be prohibited.
    (2) Huo Fubao has been away from home for seven years without news. His wife Su Xiuting remarried, Huo Fubao cannot demand Su Xiuting to return after he returns home.

Editor:
    (1) Are there still conditions for divorce? Doesn't our marriage law have eight conditions? Doesn't it stipulate that divorce is possible as long as one of the conditions is met? If there are no conditions and both parties are willing to divorce, can they divorce? If one party is unwilling, can they not divorce? Is this marriage law still applicable now?
    (2) Is it permissible to marry after premarital sex? This issue was discussed at the Taihang Judicial Conference, which said, "It is a feudal view to say that premarital sex cannot be followed by marriage. However, if the masses oppose it (premarital sex followed by instigating another person's divorce and then marrying), their marriage should be restricted or delayed to take care of the masses' sympathy, rather than a one-size-fits-all approach." According to the spirit of the marriage issue recently conveyed by the Women's Federation, this approach is wrong. Which is the correct one?
    (3) The marriage law stipulates that children after divorce, those under four years old are to be raised by the woman, and those over four years old are to be raised by the man. If the woman takes the child under four years old to remarry, and after the child is four years old, the ex-husband wants the child back, is it allowed?
　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　Zheng Bingcai, Judicial Section, Shahe County

    Answer: (1) The cited law is still applicable, but your statement that "one party's unwillingness prevents divorce" is inconsistent with Article 17, Item 1 of the former Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu Border Region Marriage Regulations.
    (2) Cohabitation before marriage does not necessarily mean that marriage is not allowed. However, if the so-called "premarital sex" involves instigating another person's divorce with definite evidence, it should be considered a crime of disrupting the family. This is a separate issue from marrying after premarital sex.
    (3) If the woman takes the child under four years old and raises them, the ex-husband cannot demand the child back.

### 有关婚姻法诸问题　华北人民政府司法部答问

专栏：询问与答复

　　有关婚姻法诸问题
  　华北人民政府司法部答问编辑同志：
    一月十九日人民日报询问与答复栏内登载早婚害处，另见规定结婚年龄为男二十岁、女十八岁。原晋冀鲁豫区却规定男十八岁、女十六岁。三十七年我在临城东关工作，见十五岁的范双廷和女方李小四（十八岁）结婚，感情很好。他们不够年龄，是否合法？（太行一专署乔玉庆）
    答：（一）目前关于结婚年龄之规定，尚未统一，原晋察冀区规定男二十岁、女十八岁。原晋冀豫鲁区规定男十八岁、女十六岁。在统一规定未公布前，各照所在地区处理。
    （二）法律规定之结婚年龄是对的。至于个别的未达结婚年龄，双方已自愿结了婚，相处又好，政府事先又未教育纠正，事后亦不必以不合法而予以拆散。
    　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　华北人民政府司法部编辑同志：
    （一）寨北与会口两村，有一对男女，均十四、五岁，因家庭困难，到政府要求结婚，政府不准，对吗？
    （二）陈家院村霍福保，在民国三十年七月敌扫荡时被敌抓走，一直七年生死不明。其妻苏秀廷，在三十四年间，改嫁到小北头村李栓栓为妻，已三年多。去年十一月间，霍福保他父亲到山西蒋福保叫回，现霍福保与苏秀廷起了纠纷；但苏秀廷提出坚决不回霍福保家。这事该怎样解决？　　　平山县九区凤兰
    答：（一）男女双方未达结婚年龄不能结婚。寨北和会口两村的婚姻问题，当地政府的处理是正确的。法律规定结婚年龄，是因为发育不成熟即行结婚有害身体，生的子女也不健全。为己及后代健康，应禁止早婚。
    （二）霍福保离家七年没有音信，其妻苏秀廷改嫁，霍福保归家后不能要求苏秀廷返回。
    　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　华北人民政府司法部编辑同志：
    （一）离婚是否还要有条件？咱们的婚姻法令不是有八个条件吗？不是规定只要有条件之一就可以离婚？若无条件双方自愿可以离，有一方不自愿就不能离吗？现在这个婚姻法令是否还适用？
    （二）先奸后婚，是否可以？这问题在太行司法会上讨论说　“先奸不能后婚，这是封建观点；但如群众反对者（先奸挑拨他人离婚后再结婚），应限制其结婚，或延缓结婚，照顾群众同情，而不是一刀两断的办法。”根据妇联会最近传达的婚姻问题精神，如此作法，则是错误的，倒底如何对？
    （三）离婚后之子女，婚姻法规定：四岁以下归女方抚养，四岁以上归男方抚养。如果女方将未满四岁的孩子带去另嫁，四周岁后，前夫又往回要，是否允许？　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　沙河县司法科郑炳才
    答：（一）所举法令仍适用，但你所举“有一方不自愿不能离婚”与前晋冀鲁豫边区婚姻条例第十七条第一项之规定不符合。
    （二）婚前同居，并不能说不准其结婚，惟所谓“先奸”，如系挑拨他人离婚确有证据，应以妨害家庭论罪，这与先奸后婚是两个问题。
    （三）四岁以下的孩子，由女方带走抚养大了，前夫不能要求要回孩子。
