　　Combine with Workers and Peasants, Serve Workers and Peasants
    Feng Wenbin's Speech at the National Student Congress

    Comrades, friends:

    On behalf of the All-China Federation of Liberated Area Youth, I congratulate the victorious opening of the congress!

    This congress is a meeting of historical significance. It is being held in a place where the Chinese people are the masters, in the birthplace of the Chinese student movement – the ancient capital of Beijing. It is a victorious gathering of students from the liberated areas and students from the Kuomintang-controlled areas. Especially as the people of the whole country are warmly celebrating the unprecedented victory of the People's Liberation War, it makes us feel that the future of China, the future of the Chinese people and Chinese students is truly infinitely bright! All of China will soon be liberated! The rule of American imperialism and the reactionary Kuomintang government in China will soon be completely destroyed! The feudal oppression of thousands of years and the imperialist oppression of a hundred years will be overthrown by us. This is a great victory for the Chinese people, the result of the hard work and struggle of the Chinese students and the Chinese people for many years, the result of the heroic battles of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, and the result of the correct leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and its leader Chairman Mao Zedong.

    Chinese students have made glorious contributions to this earth-shaking great revolution and great victory. Thirty years ago, on May Fourth, in this very place where our congress is being held – Beijing – the students were the first to raise the banner against imperialism and the traitorous government. This then expanded into a mass movement of all strata with the active participation of the working class, and opened the first act of the Chinese New Democratic Revolution.

    From the May Fourth Movement, the experience of the student movement over the past thirty years has been very rich. Here, I would like to talk about one of the most fundamental experiences, which is that students, in order to make revolution, must unite with the workers and peasants and must serve the workers and peasants.

    Historical experience proves that what Chairman Mao said is completely correct: "The final dividing line between revolutionary, non-revolutionary, or counter-revolutionary youth lies in whether they are willing and practice integration with the workers and peasants."

    There are two lines of leadership for young people: one is to separate young people from workers and peasants, and to despise workers and peasants. This makes it easier to train young people to become slaves of imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism, to divide the unity of young people and the masses, to split and destroy the youth movement, and to suppress the revolutionary movements of the people and young people. This is the line of the reactionary Kuomintang government, which is implemented through Kang Ze, Zhu Jiahua, Chen Xueping, and Hu Shih.

    The other line is to have students unite with workers and peasants and serve the masses of workers and peasants. This is the line of the Chinese Communist Party, and it is the road taken by the broad revolutionary students in every period of the New Democratic Revolution over the past thirty years. For example, the December 9th Movement was a practice of this road. The important significance of the December 9th Movement lies not only in setting off a climax of the national salvation movement, but also in putting forward the idea of "going to the countryside" to mobilize the broad masses of students to unite with the peasants, and playing the role of a bridge to spread revolutionary theory. During the War of Resistance Against Japan, a large number of students who participated in the December 9th Movement took off their student uniforms and participated in the people's army and the revolutionary construction work in the base areas in Yan'an, North China, Shandong, Guangdong, and Central China, and persisted in guerrilla warfare behind enemy lines and built new democratic liberated areas together with workers and peasants. A particularly famous example is that Zeng Sheng, who participated in the December 9th Movement, became the creator of the Dongjiang Column, and Huang Jing, one of the student leaders of the December 9th Movement in Beijing, was one of the main founders of the anti-Japanese base in central Hebei. In the liberated area schools, students from the Kuomintang-controlled areas and students from the liberated areas and newly grown worker-peasant intellectuals combined to develop a viewpoint of serving the workers and peasants. Many students personally participated in land reform, labor production movements, and various services in the war, and were completely integrated with the workers and peasants. The effect of this kind of education has been fully proven. Therefore, the history of the student movement over the past thirty years can be said to be a history of the development of intellectuals moving towards integration with the workers and peasants.

    Why must intellectuals unite with workers and peasants? Why must they serve the masses of workers and peasants? This is because: workers and peasants account for 90 percent of the country's population in terms of quantity; in terms of quality, they are the creators of all social wealth; among them, the workers represent the most advanced productive forces, so they are the leading class of the Chinese revolution; the peasants account for 80 percent of the population, so they are the main force of the Chinese revolution. Without workers and peasants, there would be no Chinese revolution, and there would be no China.

    Some people admit that they want to serve the country and society, but they are unwilling to serve the workers and peasants. But what country are they serving for the country? What society are they serving for society? In the current China, the main body of the country and society is either workers and peasants, or imperialists, feudal landlords, and bureaucratic capitalists. Is there any other main body besides this? Are we not serving workers and peasants, but serving imperialists, feudal landlords, and bureaucratic capitalists?

    Some people are willing to serve the people, but are unwilling to serve the workers and peasants. But the masses of the people are mainly workers and peasants. Besides workers and peasants, what broad masses of the people are there to speak of?

    It should be known that students and intellectuals have never been an independent social force. Therefore, there has never been a so-called independent student movement or intellectual movement that neither combines with the reactionary ruling class nor combines with the working people. Students and intellectuals have always had only two paths to take: either to serve the reactionary exploiting class, or to serve the exploited working people. There is no third way to go besides this.

    How to combine with the workers and peasants? How to serve the masses of workers and peasants?

    When we study in school, we must first figure out who we are studying for? Why are we studying? We should establish the purpose of learning, which is to learn in order to serve the masses of workers and peasants well, and to learn in order to build a new democratic country well. Of course, learning is also for our own progress, for increasing our knowledge. However, this demand for progress and knowledge can only exert its greatest power when it is combined with the interests of the people and the interests of the masses of workers and peasants. That is to say, in order to serve the people well rather than badly, to serve the workers and peasants, we must study, we must have knowledge; and without knowledge, or with insufficient knowledge, we cannot serve the people and the workers and peasants well.

    The phrase "combine with the workers and peasants, serve the workers and peasants" is easy to say, but not easy to do. This is a serious ideological revolution, and it requires a process of continuous ideological struggle. Therefore, we must be very determined to abandon the "superiority" over the workers and peasants, humbly learn from the workers and peasants, always care about the lives of the workers and peasants, understand and be familiar with the situation of the workers and peasants, and cultivate our own revolutionary outlook on life and the world. In this way, we can unite with the workers and peasants and serve the workers and peasants.

    Most of our students have great enthusiasm and are willing to unite with the workers and peasants and serve the workers and peasants. However, there are two ways to combine here. One is the method of bestowing favors from above the masses. Whether it is the Jesus-style of saving people from suffering or the chivalrous style of fighting injustice, they all believe that they are the savior who liberates the masses of workers and peasants. Using this attitude to "combine" with the workers and peasants will inevitably be incompatible. We are us, and the workers and peasants are still the workers and peasants. It is like oil floating on water, and it is still not combined. I remember a story: a very enthusiastic student spoke eloquently to the masses of workers and peasants, but the masses did not understand, and people dispersed before he finished speaking. He angrily scolded, "I'm serving you, giving you democracy, but you don't want it." Of course, it will never be successful to combine with the masses in this way.

    Now I remember another story, which can illustrate another way to combine with the workers and peasants. This is the story of Comrade Peng Pai in Haifeng and Lufeng, Guangdong, combining with the peasants. Comrade Peng Pai used to be a college student, and his family was a landlord. He was determined to serve the masses of workers and peasants and to publicize to the masses of workers and peasants, but the masses ignored him and did not listen to him. After returning, he was not discouraged. After careful research, he took off his student uniform, changed his student accent, went deep into the countryside, and lived with the peasants. He felt the suffering of the peasants being exploited by the landlords as if it were his own suffering, and discussed with the peasants how to relieve this suffering. Among the peasants, he merged with the peasants, making the peasants – including himself – feel and exert the great power of "self-help." This method is the method of truly combining with the workers and peasants. Comrade Peng Pai sincerely combined with the workers and peasants, so he was warmly loved by the masses and became one of the early leaders of the Chinese peasant movement. Now Comrade Peng Pai has sacrificed, but Comrade Peng Pai's spirit of sincerely combining with the workers and peasants will always be a role model and example for our young students and all intellectuals.

    Comrades: We hope that all of you will have this view of serving the masses of workers and peasants in your studies, and be prepared to be determined to go to the masses of workers and peasants, to the battle, and to practical work to train yourselves to become conscious fighters serving the workers and peasants, and sincerely combine with the masses of workers and peasants.

    Students combining with the workers and peasants and serving the workers and peasants is still the only correct direction for the student movement. I believe that the National Student Congress will definitely study and decide on how to realize this spirit in study and work. Then, after the congress, our student movement will make greater contributions to the struggle against imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism, and to the construction of a new democratic country.

　　与工农群众结合　为工农群众服务
    冯文彬在全国学代会上讲话
    【新华社北平九日电】中国解放区青年联合会代表冯文彬于二日在中华全国学生第十四届代表大会上，以“与工农群众结合，为工农群众服务”为题，作了一个报告，全文如下：各位同学，各位朋友：
    我代表中国解放区青年联合会，庆祝大会的胜利开幕！
    这次大会是有历史意义的一次会议，是在中国人民作了主人的地方，在中国学生运动的发源地——古都北平召开的，是解放区学生与国民党统治区学生的胜利的大会合。特别是在全国人民热烈地庆祝人民解放战争空前的胜利中开幕，使我们感到，中国的前途，中国人民与中国学生的前途，实在是有无限的光明！全中国不久就要解放了！美帝国主义与国民党反动政府在中国的统治，即将完全灭亡！几千年来的封建压迫，一百年来的帝国主义压迫将要被我们推翻，这是中国人民的伟大胜利，是中国学生和中国人民一道多年来努力奋斗的成果，是中国人民解放军英勇战斗的成果，是中国共产党及其领袖毛泽东主席正确领导的成果。
    对于这个翻天覆地的伟大的革命与伟大的胜利，中国学生是有光辉的贡献的。在三十年前的五月四日，就在我们这个大会所在地——北平，学生们首先高举反对帝国主义与卖国政府的大旗。接着扩大为有工人阶级积极参加的各阶层的群众运动，揭开了中国新民主主义革命的第一幕。
    从“五四”运动起，三十年来，学生运动的经验是很丰富的。我在这里想说一说其中最基本的一个经验，就是学生为了革命，必须与工农群众结合，必须为工农群众服务。
    历史的经验证明，毛主席所说：“革命的，不革命的或反革命的青年之最后的分界，看其是否愿意并且实行同工农民众相结合。”是完全正确的。
    对于青年的领导存在着两条路线：一条是要青年脱离工农，轻视工农，这样就便于训练青年成为帝国主义封建主义与官僚资本主义的奴仆，便于分化青年与人民群众的团结，便于分裂和破坏青年运动，便于镇压人民和青年的革命运动。这是国民党反动政府的路线，它是通过康泽、朱家骅、陈雪屏、胡适之流来执行的。
    另一条路线是要学生与工农结合，为工农大众服务。这是中国共产党的路线，是三十年来新民主主义革命的各个时期中，广大的革命学生所走的道路。例如“一二九”运动就是这条道路的一个实践。“一二九”运动的重要意义，不仅在掀起了全国救亡运动的高潮，而且提出了“到农村去”发动广大学生与农民结合，并发挥了传播革命理论的桥梁作用。在抗日战争中，参加“一二九”运动的大批同学，脱下学生装，在延安，在华北，在山东，在广东，在华中参加了人民军队及根据地革命建设工作，和工人农民一道在敌后坚持游击战争，建设新民主主义的解放区。其中特别著名的例子，如参加“一二九”运动的曾生，成为东江纵队的创造者，北平“一二九”学生领袖之一黄敬，则是冀中抗日根据地的主要建立者之一，在解放区学校里，从国民党统治区进来的学生和解放区内的学生和新生长的工农知识分子结合在一起，养成了为工农群众服务的观点，许多学生都亲身参加了土地改革劳动生产运动和战争中的各种服务，和工农群众完全结成一体。这种教育的效果，已经得到了充分的证明。因此，三十年来一部学生运动史，可以说就是一部知识分子走向与工农群众结合的发展史。
    为什么知识分子一定要和工农结合呢？为什么一定要为工农群众服务呢？这是因为：工人和农民在数量上说占全国人口的百分之九十；在质量上说是一切社会财富的创造者；其中工人因为代表着最进步的生产力，所以是中国革命的领导阶级；农民因为占人口的百分之八十，所以是中国革命的主力。离开了工人和农民，就没有了中国革命，也就没有了中国。
    有人承认要为国家服务，为社会服务，但不愿为工农服务。可是为国家服务，究竟是为什么国家呢？为社会服务，究竟是为什么社会呢？在目前的中国，国家和社会的主体，或者是工人和农民，或者是帝国主义者，封建地主和官僚资本家。难道除此以外，还有什么旁的主体吗？难道我们不为工人和农民服务，还要替帝国主义者，封建地主和官僚资本家服务吗？
    又有人愿意为人民服务，不愿为工农服务。但是人民群众主要的就是工农。除了工农以外，还有什么广大的人民群众可言？
    应该知道，学生和知识分子从来就不是一个独立的社会力量，因此，从来也就没有所谓既不与反动的统治阶级相结合又不与劳动人民相结合的独立的学生运动或知识分子运动。从来的学生和知识分子就只有两条路走，或者是为反动的剥削阶级服务，或者是为被剥削的劳动人民服务。除此以外，是没有第三条路走的。
    怎样和工农群众结合呢？怎样为工农群众服务呢！
    我们在学校里读书，首先就要弄清楚为谁学习？为什么学习？我们应当确立学习的目的，就是为了要很好地为工农群众服务而学习，就是为了很好地建设新民主主义国家而学习。固然，学习也是为了自己的进步，为了自己增长知识。但是，这种求进步长知识的要求，只有和人民的利益，工农群众的利益相结合的时候，才能发挥最大的力量。就是说，为了要很好地而不是很坏地为人民服务，为工农服务，所以我们就要学习，就要有知识；而没有知识，或知识不足，是不能很好地为人民服务，为工农服务的。
    “和工农群众结合，为工农群众服务”这句话说是容易，但做起来，是不容易的。这是一个严重的思想革命，要经过不断的思想斗争的过程。因此，我们要下很大的决心，放弃对工农群众的“优越感”，虚心向工农群众学习，经常关心工农群众的生活，了解与熟悉工农群众的情况，培养自己具有革命的人生观和世界观。这样，我们才能够和工农群众结合起来，为工农群众服务。
    我们大部分同学，都有很高的热情，愿意和工农群众结合，为工农群众服务的。但是，这里有两种结合的方法。一种是站在群众之上的恩赐方法，无论是救苦救难的耶苏式的，或是打抱不平的侠客式的，都认为自己是解放工农群众的救世主。用这种态度去和工农群众“结合”，结果一定格格不入。我们是我们，工农还是工农，好象浮在水上的油一样，还是没有结合起来。我想起一个故事：有一位很热情的同学，向工农群众讲得舌敝唇焦，但是群众听不懂，话没讲完人都散了。他生气地骂着说：“老子给你们服务，给你们民主，你们却不要。”当然，这样来和群众结合，是一定不会成功的。
    现在我又想起另外一个故事，它可以说明另一个和工农结合的方法。这就是广东海陆丰的澎湃同志和农民结合的故事。澎湃同志过去是大学生，家里是地主，他下了决心为工农群众服务，向工农群众宣传，但是群众却不理他，不听他的话。他回去以后并不灰心，经过了仔细的研究以后，他就脱下学生服、改了学生腔，深入农村，与农民生活在一起。农民受地主剥削的苦痛，他体会到和他自己的苦痛一样，并和农民在一起讨论如何解除这个苦痛。他在农民之中，和农民溶合在一起，使农民——他自己也在内——感觉到并发挥了“自己救自己”的伟大的力量。这种方法就是真正和工农结合的方法。澎湃同志真心和工农结合了，所以他受到群众的热烈爱戴，成了中国农民运动的初期领袖之一。现在澎湃同志是牺牲了，但是澎湃同志的真心和工农群众结合的精神，将永远是我们青年学生和一切知识分子的榜样与模范。
    同学们：我们希望各位在学习中，要有这样的为工农群众服务的观点，要准备下决心到工农群众中，到战斗中，到实际工作中去锻炼自己成为自觉地为工农服务的战士，真心和工农群众结合起来。
    学生和工农群众结合，为工农群众服务，还是学生运动的唯一正确的方向。我相信全国学生代表大会，一定会本着这个精神，研究并议定在学习中、工作中如何实现的方法。那么，在大会以后，我们的学生运动，对于反对帝国主义、封建主义和官僚资本主义的斗争，对于新民主主义国家的建设工作，将会有更大的贡献。
