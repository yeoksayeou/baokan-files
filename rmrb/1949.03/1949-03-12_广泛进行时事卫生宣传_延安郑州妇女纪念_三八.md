　　Extensive Current Affairs and Hygiene Promotion
    Yan'an and Zhengzhou Women Commemorate "March 8th"
    [Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 10th] In Yan'an, women carried out various activities for "March 8th" International Women's Day. Many female workers and students formed propaganda teams and yangko dance teams to hold discussions and gatherings with women in nearby rural areas, promoting current affairs and hygiene. The Yan'an Women's Federation held a get-together in the evening for nearly a thousand people. The nannies of the Nursery School of the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region held a discussion to review their childcare work.
    [Xinhua News Agency, Central Plains, 10th] On March 8th, more than 5,000 women from all walks of life in Zhengzhou City held separate meetings to commemorate International Working Women's Day. Many female workers and ordinary women expressed at these meetings that they would work hard to produce and support the people's liberation struggle, and liberate women throughout the country. The city has been holding symposiums for women from all walks of life since March 2nd. At the symposium for women cadres in the city, many female cadres from government offices reviewed their erroneous views of underestimating women's work, and expressed that they would care about the interests of the broad masses of working women in the future. Many female workers and poor working women recounted the persecution they suffered at the hands of the Kuomintang bandits at different symposiums. Zhang Da Niang from Limin Factory said: "The Kuomintang bandit army breached the Yellow River at Huayuankou, drowning my man alive. I took my children without food or drink and suffered so much. Only when the People's Liberation Army came, did I turn over!" Hu Qinglian, a female worker from a certain public factory, said: "Since the People's Liberation Army came, the status of us workers has improved. Not to mention anything else, we are no longer searched every day we work. The factory has become our own home, and we must abide by the factory rules, take care of public property, and step up production."
