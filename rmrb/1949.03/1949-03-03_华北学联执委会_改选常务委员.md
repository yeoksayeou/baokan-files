　　North China Student Federation Executive Committee
  　Re-elects Standing Committee Members
    [Xinhua News Agency, Beiping, 1st] The Executive Committee of the North China Student Federation held a meeting in Beiping on the 26th and 27th of last month. Regional representatives attending the meeting included: Eastern Hebei, Central Shanxi, Hebei-Shandong-Henan, Shijiazhuang, Taihang, Southern Hebei, as well as newly liberated Beiping and Tianjin. At the meeting, each executive committee member first reported on the work of the student federations in their respective regions, with executive committee members from the old liberated areas reporting on the implementation of the general assembly's resolutions and the state of the student movement. Executive committee members from the newly liberated areas reported on the student movement after liberation and the current problems. The meeting also re-elected the Standing Committee. When the North China Student Federation was established, Beiping and Tianjin had not yet been liberated, so the Standing Committee was temporary at that time. The results of the re-election (by region) were: one Chairman: Beiping; two Vice-Chairmen: North China University (directly affiliated school), Tianjin; four Standing Committee Members: Central Hebei, Central Shanxi, Beiping, Chahar.

　　华北学联执委会
  　改选常务委员
    【新华社北平一日电】华北学生联合会执行委员会，于上月二十六、二十七两日在平举行会议。出席该会的地区代表计有：冀东、晋中、冀鲁豫、石家庄、太行、冀南，以及新解放的北平、天津等。会议首先由各执委汇报各地区学联的工作情况，老解放区执委报告执行大会决议的情形及学运状况；新解放区执委报告解放后的学运及目前存在的问题。会议并改选了常委会，因华北学联成立时，平津尚未解放，当时常委是临时性的。改选结果（以地区为单位）：主席一人：北平；副主席二人：华北大学（直属学校）、天津；常委四人：冀中、晋中、北平、察哈尔。
