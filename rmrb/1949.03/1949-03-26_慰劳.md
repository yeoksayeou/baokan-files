　　[This newspaper's report] The preparatory committee of the Pingjin Clothing Factory Trade Union held a representative meeting on the 24th, enthusiastically responding to the movement to comfort the troops. Workers donated a large number of vests, tobacco leaves and other daily necessities. The vests sent by the Fourth Sewing Class were sewn with the words "To the heroic combat heroes." The towels were inscribed with slogans such as "Carry the revolution through to the end," and some were attached with letters of solicitation.

In addition to donating daily necessities such as soap, notebooks, and vests, as well as letters of solicitation, the workers are also preparing to have a get-together with the local garrison troops recently.
　　[Another report] One hundred and twenty people from the third training class of the Beijing Postal Administration, in addition to buying gifts and writing letters of solicitation, also collectively wrote a letter, with each person writing a sentence personally. (Qiang Hua)
