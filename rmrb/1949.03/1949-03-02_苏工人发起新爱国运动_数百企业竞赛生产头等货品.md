　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, February 28th: TASS, Moscow, February 24th: In late January, a new patriotic movement of great significance to the Soviet Union emerged at the Red Kholm Textile Factory in Moscow. Zhutkik, a deputy foreman at the factory, and the textile workers in his workshop, undertook the obligation to specialize in producing high-quality textiles and proposed launching a movement to win the title of "Top-Quality Goods Production Work Team." The newspaper *Pravda* published an editorial on this, stating: In just a few days, Zhutkik's initiative was echoed by all the workers in textile factories. News of his achievements quickly spread throughout the country and aroused enthusiastic responses from hundreds of other enterprises. Many high-quality goods production work teams have emerged in Leningrad, Ivanovo, Saratov, Tashkent, Kazan, and many other cities. *Pravda* pointed out: The high-quality goods production competition movement is a profound patriotic act. Every industrial worker must maintain the honor of their respective product trademarks. Everything stamped with the seal of the Soviet state, everything produced by socialist factories, and everything made by the Soviet people must be perfect and must be the best in the world. *Pravda* called for the promotion of the movement initiated by Zhutkik in all Soviet industrial sectors.

    【新华社陕北二十八日电】塔斯社莫斯科二十四日讯：一月下旬，莫斯科的红色贺尔姆纺织工厂出现了对于苏联有重大意义的新的爱国运动。该厂一位副领班朱特基克及其工作间的纺织工人，承担了专事生产高等质量的纺织品的义务，并且提议发动争取头等货品生产工作队的称号的运动。真理报为此特发表社论称：仅仅几天之间，朱特基克的倡议，便得到各纺织厂全体工人的响应。关于他的成就的新闻，很快便传遍全国各地，并激起了数百个其他企业的热烈响应。列宁格勒、伊凡诺夫、萨拉多夫、塔什十、喀山及其他许多城市，已涌现出许多高等质量货品生产工作队。真理报指出：高等质量货品生产竞赛运动，是深刻的爱国的举动。每个产业工人必须保持他们各自货品商标的荣誉。打有苏维埃国家戳印的每一件东西，社会主义工厂出产的每一件东西，苏联人民制造的每一件东西，都必须是完美的，必须是世界上最好的。真理报号召在苏维埃各工业部门中推广朱特基克发起的运动。
