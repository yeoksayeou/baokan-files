　　Bureaucracy in Certain State-Owned Factories in Shijiazhuang Urgently Needs Correction
　　Employee Representative Conference Raises Criticism
　　[Reported by this newspaper] The second and third days of the first Shijiazhuang Employee Representative Conference were devoted to criticizing the bureaucratic leadership in certain state-owned factories. The representatives enthusiastically supported the spirit of democratic factory management. However, some representatives from state-owned factories reported that their factories had not established a factory management committee, and they had never even heard of it. Some factories that had established such committees found them to be empty shells, with most members being administrative cadres and only one from the trade union. Workers' opinions were not solicited, and administration was still handled in a monopolistic manner. Some individual administrative heads believed that the existence of a trade union was insignificant and looked down upon trade union cadres. For example, the chief of the engineering department of the Da Xing Cotton Mill did not accept the opinions of the trade union and had a poor attitude towards workers. Furthermore, when the factory added workers in February of this year, the factory and the trade union had conflicting standards for hiring workers. The trade union made suggestions, but the factory ignored them. As a result, an abnormal impression was created among the workers in some factories that the trade union was ineffective and that trade union cadres were not as influential as administrative cadres. Some factories suffered losses due to a lack of planning by the leadership and a failure to listen to workers' opinions. For example, the soda factory led by the North China Industrial Company was idle in the winter, and instead of actively trying to switch to other work, workers and technicians were made to pick bricks and sweep the yard. Some factories did not pay attention to workers' welfare and cultural studies during the production increase campaign. Workers brought it up once or twice and were ignored, so they stopped mentioning it. Individual administrative cadres had serious bureaucratic tendencies. For example, Guo Ruitian, secretary of the coking plant, did not abide by the system and did not distinguish between public and private matters. He sometimes took coal from the workshop for his own use. When workers raised objections, he not only refused to admit it but also threatened them. After the Lunar New Year, the factory was shut down for fifteen days. Worker Wang Jingshan took sick leave due to illness, and when work resumed, he was well and went to work immediately without delay. However, Secretary Guo paid him wages based on sick leave at three jin of rice per day. After the trade union raised objections, the factory gave him a little more money, but still not according to his original wages. Guo Ruitian also sometimes cursed at workers, and workers' criticisms of him were futile because he controlled the suggestion box and suppressed any suggestions made. After these cases were initially reported, the presidium of the conference and all the representatives unanimously and sharply pointed out that such undemocratic leadership and bureaucratic style in certain factories had, to varying degrees, damaged the workers' sense of ownership and responsibility, affecting the further improvement of workers' enthusiasm for production. All representatives enthusiastically supported Comrade Wu Liren's call from the Municipal Party Committee to take up the weapons of criticism and self-criticism to fight against不良现象bad phenomena, strengthen the unity of the workers, and improve production.

　　石市某些公营工厂
  　官僚主义亟需纠正
    职工代表大会提出批评
    【本报讯】石家庄市首届职工代表大会第二、第三两日，对某些公营工厂领导上的官僚主义进行了批评。代表们对工厂管理民主化的精神，都热烈拥护；但有些公营工厂的代表反映，他们厂没成立工厂管理委员会，连听说过也没有；有些厂子虽成立起来了，但是空架子，委员多是行政干部，工会仅有一个人，也没征求过工人底意见，还是行政上包办。个别行政负责人认为有无工会，无足轻重，看不起工会干部。如大兴纱厂工务部长对工会提的意见不接受，对工人态度不好。又该厂今年二月添工人时，录用工人的标准，厂方与工会的意见不一致，工会曾提出建议，厂方不理。所以，有的厂子在工人中造成一种不正常的印象，认为工会不顶事，工会干部不如行政干部吃得开。有的工厂由于领导上缺乏计划性，又不倾听工人意见，工作受到损失。如华北实业公司领导的汽水工厂，冬天闲着没事，不积极想法转业开工，让工人和技师在院子里拣砖头，打扫院子。有的厂在增产运动中不注意工人的福利和文化学习，工人提一次两次，没理，以后也都不提了。个别行政干部存有严重的官僚主义，如炼焦分厂秘书郭瑞田不遵守制度，公私不分，有时把工房里的煤推到自己家里用，工人给提意见，不但不承认，反威吓工人。旧历年后，该厂曾停工十五天，工人王景山因病请假，开工时，病也好了，马上到工没耽误活。郭秘书却按病假每天三斤米发给工资，经工会提意见，厂方又稍给他一部份钱，仍未按原资发。郭瑞田有时还辱骂工人，工人对他提出批评，也白搭，因为他管着意见箱，提了意见，也被他押住。类此事例经初步反映后，大会主席团和全体代表都一致尖锐指出：某些工厂这种领导不民主和官僚主义作风，在不同程度上损害了工人底主人翁自觉性与责任感，影响工人对生产积极性进一步的提高，全体代表一致热烈拥护市委吴立人同志的号召，拿起批评与自我批评的武器，向不良现象作斗争，加强职工的团结，把生产搞好。
