　　Civilian Laborer Mao Tuzi Seizes Gun

　　In the recent battle to attack Taiyuan, civilian laborer Mao Tuzi volunteered to rush to the front line to complete the task of transporting door panels. Accompanying him were the civilian laborers from Yuzi Village in Jiexiu. In the place where they were concealed, bullets whizzed past from left, right, front, and back. The counterattacking enemy, at this time, had already collapsed under our army's combined attack of hand grenades, bayonets, and infantry artillery. The area that had just been fiercely fought over was filled with smoke. The soldiers broke through the smoke and dust, chasing forward.
　　Mao Tuzi happened to climb onto this mountain ridge at this moment, put down the door panels, and squinting his eyes, lay on the ground, looking into the distance.
　　"Not bad! One, two, three, four..." Mao Tuzi counted that about five or six steps away, the enemy had abandoned four machine guns, and bullets were flying so fiercely that no one dared to go and retrieve them. He thought, should I run over and get them? The bullets are singing loudly. He was eager to try, carefully examining the nearby terrain, planning a way to approach: running over would make too big a target, crawling over would be too slow.... Finally, he tightened his belt, took advantage of the smoke and dust that hadn't dissipated, and rolled over. Using his belt as a rope, he捆扎了 the four machine guns tightly together, hugged them with both arms, and clamped them with his legs, and rolled back again.
　　When the battle ended, Mao Tuzi, holding a towel in his arms and carrying a bundle of machine guns on his shoulder, arrived at the regimental headquarters along with the other soldiers.
　　The leaders of the regiment cordially received him, praised his resourcefulness and bravery, and awarded him a silk banner.

　　民工毛秃子夺枪
    加里
    在最近进攻太原的战斗中，民工毛秃子自报奋勇，赶上火线完成运送门板的任务。和他相随的，是介休峪子村的民工们，在他们隐蔽的地方，子弹嘘嘘地从左右前后掠过，反扑的敌人，这时已在我军手榴弹、刺刀、步炮联合进攻下溃退下去。刚厮刹过的地方，硝烟弥漫，战士们冲破烟尘追上前去了。
    毛秃子这时恰巧爬上这道山梁，放下门板，一个人眯缝着眼，伏在地上向远处观望。
    “不赖！一、二、三、四……”毛秃子数着约五六步左右近地方，敌人撩着四挺机枪，子弹飞的没人敢去拿。他想，跑过去拿吧，子弹叫的很起劲，他跃跃欲试，端详附近地势，计划着接近的办法：奔过去，目标太大，爬过去，太慢………，最后他紧了紧裤带，乘烟尘未散，一骨碌滚过去了，腰带顶绳子，四挺机枪捆了个紧巴巴，双手一抱，腿一夹，又滚了回来。
    战斗结束时，毛秃子里搂着手巾，扛着一捆机枪，和别的战士一同到了团部。
    团的领导同志亲切地接待了他，称赞他的机智勇敢，并奖励了他一面锦旗。
