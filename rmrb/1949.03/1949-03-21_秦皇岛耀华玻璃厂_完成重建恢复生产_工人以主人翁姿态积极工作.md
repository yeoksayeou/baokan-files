[Jidong Telegram] The reconstruction of the Qinhuangdao Yaohua Glass Factory, after three months and seven days of active repairs by all workers, staff, and technicians overcoming difficulties, was successfully completed on March 3rd, and ignition commenced for production. On November 27th of last year, when Chiang Kai-shek's New Fifth Army fled the city, they carried out bestial destruction of the Yaohua Glass Factory, burning down nine rooms and destroying and looting fifteen machines, including grinding wheel machines, lathes, planers, glass knives, as well as chemical experimental instruments, precision balances, books, and other large amounts of property. In addition, the puppet "Resources Committee" had already transported a large number of finished products stored in the factory in May of last year, and before fleeing, they tricked over a hundred employees, making the factory's resumption of work extremely difficult. After the factory was taken over by us, all employees, under the leadership of the Military Control Commission, actively began reconstruction work. The democratic government also issued temporary living allowances three times (each worker received over 530 catties of millet), solving the workers' living difficulties. On January 1st, all employees organized a production committee, and all workers began to manage their own factory with the attitude of masters, bringing their labor enthusiasm into full play. In less than a month, they had repaired two lathes, one drilling machine, one sand grinding machine, and four bench vises. The workers in the masonry department also actively repaired the large kiln, and the workers in the boiler room, regardless of the cold and frozen hands, rushed to repair the frozen water pipes. Many workers handed over lost machine parts and materials from the factory. For example, worker Fan Jinlai handed over twelve pieces of canvas and belts, and Zhang Enlin and Wang Chunrong handed over American-made thermometers and four boxes of ball bearings. More than ten people were commended by the factory for handing over materials and were awarded minor merits. After various production preparation work was completed, the raw materials and equipment purchased by the factory were also successively transported in. All departments of the factory made detailed inspections of the machines in their units and submitted guarantees to the factory, requesting an early start of work. On March 3rd, all employees of the factory held a grand opening ceremony. At the meeting, Military Representative Comrade Hao Jiegou praised all the workers for their labor achievements in the past three months and called on everyone to establish a new labor attitude and work style, save raw materials, and improve product quality. After the meeting, ignition commenced for production amidst the excited mood of all the factory workers.

  　完成重建恢复生产
    工人以主人翁姿态积极工作
    【冀东电】秦皇岛耀华玻璃工厂的恢复重建工作，在全体工人、职员、技术人员克服困难积极赶修下，历时三个月零七天，已于三月三日胜利完成，点火开工。去年十一月二十七日蒋匪新五军逃离该市时，曾对耀华玻璃厂施行了兽性破坏，房屋九间被烧毁，沙轮机、旋床、刨床、玻璃刀等机器十五件及化学试验仪器、精细天平、书籍等大量资财被匪军破坏、劫走。另外伪“资源委员会”早在去年五月间即先后运走厂内所存的大批成品，溃逃前又骗走员工百余名，使该厂的复工感到极大的困难。该厂为我接管后，全体职工在军管会领导下积极开始重建工作。民主政府亦先后三次发放了临时生活维持费（工人每人得小米五百三十余斤），解决工人的生活困难。一月一日，全体职工又组织起生产委员会，全体工人开始以主人翁的姿态来管理自己的工厂，发挥了劳动积极性。不出一个月，已修理好两个旋床、一个钻床、一个磨沙机、四个老虎旋子。瓦工部的工人也积极修大窑，锅炉房工人不顾天寒手冻，赶修冻坏的水管。不少工人把工厂失散的机件物资献交出来，如工人范金来交出十二块帆布和皮带，张恩林、王春荣交出美造温度表和四盒滚珠，共有十余人因献交资材受到厂方的表扬，并立了小功。各项生产准备工作完成后，厂方购买的原料、器具也陆续运到。全厂各部门都对本单位的机器做了精细的检查，纷纷向厂方提出保证书，要求早日开工。三月三日全厂职工举行了隆重的开工典礼，会上军事代表郝洁勾同志表扬了全体工人在三个月里的劳动成绩后，号召大家树立新的劳动态度和工作作风，节省原料，提高产品质量。会后，在全厂工人的兴奋情绪中点火开工。
