The North Atlantic Treaty, which is opposed by peace-loving people all over the world, was simultaneously announced on the 18th in the United States, Canada, and the Western European countries participating in the treaty.

The text of the published North Atlantic Treaty is clearly an extremely hypocritical document. The drafters of the treaty, led by the United States government, used deceptive words in the preamble to hypocritically declare their "reaffirmation of faith in the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations," "to live in peace with all peoples and all governments," "to safeguard the freedom of their peoples, based on the principles of democracy," "to maintain peace and security," and so on. If these platitudes are translated into real language, it means tearing up the United Nations Charter, strangling the freedom of all peoples based on the principles of autocracy, destroying peace and security, and attempting to drive all nations and countries into a new aggressive war.

The drafters of the treaty portray the purpose of concluding the treaty as "self-defense" and "defense" in the event of a so-called "armed attack." But everyone knows that after the end of World War II, there was no danger of any attack on the United States, Canada, and Western Europe. On the contrary, soon after the war ended, the American reactionaries established military bases in countries bordering the Soviet Union, from Greenland, through Iceland, Britain, Portugal, Spain, Germany, Italy, Greece, the Middle East, the Far East, China, Japan, the Pacific Islands, the Aleutian Islands to Alaska, forming a so-called "great encirclement." The United States has repeatedly shipped various types of weapons to reactionaries in various countries in the form of loans. To date, the United States and Britain still maintain their joint chiefs of staff headquarters established during the war, plotting new aggressive wars. The current U.S. military is ten times larger than before the war. The U.S. military budget for 1948-1949 increased almost fourteen times compared to 1938-1939. War propaganda is rampant in the United States. The U.S. government, which repeatedly promotes "defense against armed attack," has repeatedly refused to conduct peace negotiations with the Soviet Union, and rejected the Soviet Union's proposals on disarmament and the prohibition of atomic weapons and the control of atomic energy. All of this shows that American imperialism has already and is organizing various military aggressive blocs, including the already signed Pan-American Treaty and the Brussels Treaty, as well as the Pacific Treaty which is brewing, especially the North Atlantic Treaty. Its purpose is by no means for "defense" or "self-defense," but on the contrary, precisely for offense and aggression. American imperialism has invaded everything on earth that it is currently able to invade, but it says that all of this is for "defense against armed attack." We Chinese people are particularly familiar with this shameless deception. When Japan launched attacks on China on September 18, 1931, January 28, 1932, July 7, 1937, and August 13, weren't they all saying it was for "defense against armed attack"? When American imperialism is today helping the revival of Japanese aggressive forces, isn't it also saying that it is helping Japan's "self-defense"? American imperialists and their lackeys in various countries think that by using a few words like "defense" and "self-defense," they can cover up their actual aggressive actions. They underestimate the intelligence of the people of all countries too much!

The North Atlantic Treaty is also a treaty for the United States to interfere in the internal affairs of the contracting parties, especially to interfere in the democratic movements of the people of various countries and the national liberation movements in the colonies. The treaty states: "The Parties agree that an armed attack against one or more of them in Europe or North America shall be considered an attack against them all." Secretary of State Acheson frankly announced on the 18th when interpreting this article: "Domestic revolutionary movements that receive outside assistance can be regarded as a threat of armed attack." This means that as long as American imperialism believes that any contracting country has a so-called "threat" to the United States, once a people's movement and a colonial national liberation movement, which has always been slandered by imperialism as having "foreign aid," occurs in a contracting country, it can direct the contracting countries to "jointly discuss" the "countermeasures" of suppression. The treaty also states that "the Contracting" Parties shall eliminate conflict in their international economic policies and encourage economic cooperation between any Contracting Party or all Contracting Parties. This means that the United States can not only politically oppress the revolutionary movements of the contracting parties based on the treaty, but also economically organize groups to serve the United States and turn the contracting parties into colonies of the United States.

The reality of the North Atlantic Treaty has nothing in common with the so-called adherence to the "purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations" as stated in the treaty text, and the regional conventions touted in the Charter of the United Nations. First of all, the North Atlantic Treaty was prepared and concluded privately outside the United Nations and behind its back. Secondly, the political significance of the North Atlantic Treaty is fundamentally contrary to the purpose and principles of regional agreements stipulated in Article 52 of the United Nations Charter. According to the terms of the treaty, the geographical scope of the North Atlantic Alliance includes not only "the territory of any Party in Europe or North America, the occupying forces of any Party in Europe" "including the US-British-French occupying forces in Germany, the US-British-French occupying forces in Austria, and the US-British occupying forces in Trieste"; but also includes "islands under the jurisdiction of any Party north of the Tropic of Cancer in the North Atlantic region, as well as any ship or aircraft of any Party in the region," and also includes Algiers in Africa. The North Atlantic Treaty shows that its drafters have also abandoned the international agreements they had signed that conformed to the interests of universal and lasting peace. The treaty states: The Contracting Parties have "currently valid international agreements with any other country that do not conflict with the provisions of this Treaty." However, people still remember that a few years ago, Britain and France signed twenty-year treaties of friendship and mutual assistance with the Soviet Union respectively; now, the ruling groups of Britain and France have violated these treaties, disregarding the obligations they undertook in the treaties to support and consolidate European peace together with the Soviet Union.

Thus, the North Atlantic Treaty is actually a grand alliance that the United States attempts to use to direct the major capitalist countries of the world to carry out aggression. It is a vicious counter-revolutionary group in which the United States oppresses and enslaves the people of the world. It is the main tool for the international reactionaries headed by the United States to prepare for war.

However, as we have repeatedly pointed out long ago, although the North Atlantic Treaty is a further exposure of the international reactionaries' war plan, it does not mean that war is inevitable. On the contrary, due to the strength of the world's people's peace forces, war is completely avoidable. Moreover, the people oppose aggressive war because aggressive war is harmful to the people, but if the aggressors dare to provoke war, then the anti-aggression camp will inevitably be able to win. But the reactionaries of various countries, including the reactionaries of China, do not understand this truth. They fantasize about finding their own way out of a new world war. Although the Kuomintang reactionaries are on the verge of complete extinction, they still place their hope on the world's Third World War that they are fantasizing about. They are encouraging each other behind their backs, wanting to take the opportunity to make a comeback and "recover lost ground"; but at the same time, they dare not immediately publicize this evil plan, because they are afraid that doing so will completely expose the fox's tail of false peace that they are playing with. So they disguised themselves as "absolutely neutral" people, saying that they "neither oppose the United States nor oppose the Soviet Union." Originally, the so-called "neutrality" has long been proven to be completely impossible. In today's struggle between peaceful forces and aggressive forces, people are either standing on the side of the peace camp headed by the Soviet Union or on the side of the aggressive camp headed by the United States. Now, the so-called neutral propaganda comes from the mouths of the old lackeys of American imperialism, who have always hated the Soviet Union, hated world peace, and always attempted to rely on world war to "turn over." Its deception and hypocrisy are particularly obvious.

But the strength of the world's people is now great enough to overcome the danger of a new war, and the Chinese people's liberation struggle is bound to achieve internal victory in a short period of time. Therefore, the international reactionaries headed by the United States want to find a way to escape from the serious political and economic crisis they are suffering from war, and the Kuomintang reactionaries plan to use the Third World War as a remedy for their resurrection. This is just wishful thinking.

### 斥北大西洋公约

专栏：

　　斥北大西洋公约
    全世界爱好和平的人民一致反对的北大西洋公约，已于十八日在美国、加拿大以及西欧参加该约的各国同时公布。
    这个公布的北大西洋公约的条文，显然是一个极其虚伪的文件。以美国政府为首的公约的制订者，在公约的序言中用迷惑人的字样虚伪地宣布“重申对联合国宪章目标与原则的信念”，“对一切民族与一切政府和平相处”，“决心保障基于民主原则”的“各国人民之自由”，“维持和平与安全”等等。如果把这些官样文章译成真实的语言，那就是撕毁联合国宪章，就是基于专制的原则绞杀各国人民的自由，是破坏和平与安全而企图把一切民族与国家驱入一个新的侵略战争的大火中。
    公约的制订者把缔结公约目的，描绘成为在发生所谓“武装攻击时，进行‘自卫’和‘防御’”。但尽人皆知，在第二次世界大战结束以后，并没有任何攻击美国、加拿大和西欧的危险存在。恰恰相反，在战争刚一结束不久，美国反动派却在自格林兰起，经过冰岛、英国、葡萄牙、西班牙、德国、意大利、希腊、中东、远东、中国、日本、太平洋岛屿，阿留申群岛以迄阿拉斯加等紧靠苏联边界的国家，建立所谓“大包围圈”的军事基地。美国曾经一次又一次地以贷款的方式，把各式各样的武器运交世界各国的反动派。到目前为止，美英还保持着他们在战时成立的联合参谋总部，密谋新的侵略战争。美国目前的军队，十倍于战前的数量。美国一九四八年至一九四九年的军事预算，较一九三八年至一九三九年几乎增加了十四倍。战争宣传充斥着美国。一再宣传什么“防御武装攻击”的美国政府，却又一再拒绝和苏联进行和平谈判，拒绝苏联关于裁军与禁用原子武器及管制原子能的建议。所有这一切，说明美国帝国主义已经和正在组织的各种军事侵略集团，包括已经签订的泛美公约和布鲁塞尔公约以及酝酿中的太平洋公约，特别是北大西洋公约，其目的决不是为了“防御”或“自卫”，而相反地正是为了进攻和侵略。美国帝国主义已经侵略了地球上它在目前所已经能够侵略的一切地方，但是它却说这都是为了“防御武装攻击”。对于这种无耻的欺骗，我们中国人民是特别熟悉的。当日本在一九三一年九月十八日，一九三二年一月二十八日，一九三七年七月七日和八月十三日发起对于中国的攻击的时候，不都是说为了“防御武装攻击”吗？当美国帝国主义今天扶助日本侵略势力复活的时候，不也是说要帮助日本的“自卫”吗？美国帝国主义者及其各国走狗以为用了几个“防御”“自卫”的字眼，就可以掩盖他们的实际的侵略行动，这未免把各国人民看得太蠢了！
    北大西洋公约同时又是一个为美国干涉缔约各国内政，特别是干涉各国人民民主运动和殖民地民族解放运动的公约。公约的条文说：“任何一缔约国认为，凡在领土完整、政治独立或安全已遭受威胁时，各缔约国得共同商讨对策”。美国国务卿艾奇逊十八日在解释这一条时坦白地宣布：“获得外界援助的国内革命运动，可视为武装攻击的威胁”。这就是说，只要美帝国主义认为，任何一个缔约国家发生了对美国的所谓“威胁”时，在一向被帝国主义所诬为有“外国援助”的人民运动和殖民地民族解放运动一旦在缔约国内发生时，它就可以指挥各缔约国“共同商讨”镇压的“对策”。公约条文又说，“缔约”国应消除其国际经济政策中之冲突，并鼓励任何缔约国或所有缔约国之间的经济合作。这就是说，美国不仅可以根据条约在政治上压迫各缔约国的革命运动，而且可以在经济上组织为美国服务的集团，并变各缔约国为美国的殖民地。
    北大西洋公约的实际，与公约条文所说的遵守“联合国宪章的目标与原则”，和标榜着的联合国宪章中所规定的区域公约，毫无共同之处。首先，北大西洋公约是完全背着联合国而在联合国之外，私下准备和缔结的。其次，北大西洋公约的政治意义与联合国宪章第五十二条所规定的区域性协定的目的和原则根本抵触。按照公约的条款，北大西洋联盟的地理范围，不仅包括“欧洲、北美任一缔约国之领土，欧洲任何缔约国之占领军队”“包括德国境内之美英法占领军、奥国境内之美英法占领军、及的里亚斯特之美英占领军”；而且包括“北大西洋区域回归线以北任何一缔约国所辖岛屿，以及该区域内任何缔约国之船舶或飞机”，并且还包括非洲的阿尔及尔。北大西洋公约显示，它的制订者还背弃了他们曾经签订的符合普遍与持久和平利益的国际协定。公约的条款说：缔约国“与任何其他国家间目前犹属有效之国际协定，并不与本公约中之规定相抵触。”可是，人们还记得，在几年以前，英法两国曾分别与苏联签订了二十年友好互助条约；现在，英法两国的统治集团违反了这些条约，将它们在条约中所承担的会同苏联支持与巩固欧洲和平的义务置若罔闻了。
    这样，北大西洋公约实际上就是美国企图用以指挥世界主要资本主义国家实行侵略的大联合，是美国压迫和奴役世界人民的一个凶恶的反革命集团，是以美国为首的国际反动派准备战争的主要工具。
    但是，如我们所早已再三指出，北大西洋公约虽然是国际反动派战争计划的进一步暴露，却并不是说战争已经不可避免。相反的，由于世界人民和平力量的强大，战争是完全可避免的。而且人民反对侵略战争，是因为侵略战争对于人民有害，但是如果侵略者竟然胆敢挑起战争，那么，反侵略阵营是必然可以取得胜利的。可是各国的反动派，其中也包括中国的反动派，是不懂得这个真理的。他们幻想从新的世界战争中找到自己的出路。国民党反动派虽然到了快要完全灭亡的时候，仍然把希望放在他们所幻想的世界第三次大战上面。他们正在背后互相打气，想在那时候卷土重来，“收复失地”；但他们同时又不敢把这个鬼胎马上公诸于世，因为他们害怕这样会把他们自己玩弄的假和平的狐狸尾巴完全露出来。于是他们就改装成“绝对中立”者，说什么“既不反美，也不反苏”。本来，所谓“中立”事实早经证明是完全不可能的，人们在今天的和平势力与侵略势力的斗争中，不是站在以苏联为首的和平阵营方面，便是站在以美国为首的侵略阵营方面。现在所谓中立的宣传出之于美帝国主义的老牌走狗，素来仇视苏联，仇视世界和平，素来企图依靠世界大战“翻身”的老爷们之口，其欺骗和虚伪性就格外明显了。
    但是目前世界人民的力量已经大得足以战胜新战争的危险，而中国人民的解放斗争则一定要在不久的时间内获得内部胜利。因此，以美国为首的国际反动派，想从战争中寻找逃出他们遭受着的严重的政治经济危机的道路，国民党反动派打算将第三次世界大战作为他们起死回生的药方，这同样不过是在作梦。
