　　Gaobeidian People
  　Elect New Township Head Through Secret Ballot
    [Ping City News] On the 10th of this month, Gaobeidian Village, Fourteenth Bao, Outer Fourteenth District, held a mass meeting to denounce the crimes of the puppet Bao chiefs Zhou Baotian and Liu Zhendong. More than 500 men and women attended the meeting, and 18 men and women spoke at the meeting, recounting the facts of the puppet Bao chiefs' embezzlement, waste, and oppression of the people before and after liberation. The masses demanded that the People's Government handle them according to law based on the severity of their crimes. The work team, Chen, announced on the spot the abolition of the Bao-Jia system and the establishment of a new democratic regime. The masses then elected Ma Ziming (poor peasant) as the township head, Zhang Qixiang (poor peasant) as the deputy township head, and three others as committee members by secret ballot. When Ma Ziming took office, he said: "I will definitely work hard for everyone. If I do something wrong, everyone should feel free to point it out to me. In the future, we must thoroughly abolish the previous unreasonable systems and bureaucratic work styles, and discuss matters with everyone."
