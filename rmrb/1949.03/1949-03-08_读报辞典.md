    Communist Party of Austria
    -- The Communist Party of Austria (CPA) had 8,000 members before World War II. In April 1945, after the Soviet Red Army liberated the Austrian capital Vienna, the CPA joined the Austrian provisional government jointly formed by the Social Democratic Party, the Christian Social Party, and other non-party leaders. Under the coercion and enticement of American imperialism, this government became increasingly reactionary. In November 1947, it completely submitted to the domination of the United States and implemented the "currency reform," which cruelly plundered the people. In order to stand on the side of the people and wage an open and resolute struggle against the reactionary regime, the CPA announced its withdrawal from the government. At that time, the CPA had 220,000 members, accounting for one-thirtieth of the country's population (6.6 million).

    Communist Party of Finland
    -- The Communist Party of Finland (CPF) was founded by Otto Kuusinen (currently the Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Karelo-Finnish Republic, one of the sixteen Soviet Union republics). Before World War II, the CPF had 2,000 members. In August 1948, the number of members increased to 53,227, accounting for 14% of the country's population (3.6 million). After World War II, the CPF formed the Finnish People's Democratic League with the Socialist Unity Party, participated in the government, and strived to eradicate fascist remnants, implement democracy, and improve the living standards of the working people. In September 1948, Fagerholm of the Finnish right-wing Social Democratic Party disrupted the cabinet formation negotiations and unilaterally formed a reactionary cabinet of the right-wing Social Democratic Party. The struggle of the CPF in the country became even more intense. The current chairman of the CPF is Aalto Honen, the general secretary is Ville Pessi, and Ms. Kuusinen, one of the executive committee members, also serves as the chairman of the parliamentary group of the People's Democratic League.
