　　On the Forest Railway Line
    Chen Sheng
    At a forest railway workers' meeting, a challenge letter from another forest railway line was read aloud:
    "In order to build the new Northeast and support the national liberation cause, ... sleepers, bridge timbers, utility poles, pit props, all kinds of military and construction timber must meet the needs of the whole country, which must be guaranteed by us, and transport the timber to Guannei! ..."
    The lights shone on the workers' excited faces, and they enthusiastically discussed their response plan, oblivious to the lateness of the hour. In the lush, boundless Northeast forest area, in the layered, verdant mountains, winding along are many well-maintained light railway lines, or forest railways directly operated by the Forestry Bureau, specializing in transporting timber. Like arteries delivering fresh blood day and night, they support the national revolution and construction with abundant Northeast timber resources.
    Forest railway workers firmly remember that the liberation and construction of the Northeast and the whole country require an unprecedented scale of material supply, and they are required to exchange every cubic meter of timber with their own sweat to ensure its completion. This is a process of overcoming dangerous engineering conditions and harsh climates with courage, wisdom, and arduous struggle. Sometimes the railway runs on the mountainside, overlooking the valley bottom, where you can see the dense forest lying quietly at your feet, and sometimes you can see a chimney standing below - this is a sawmill in the deep mountains. The line winds from this mountain around to another peak, and sometimes passes through a long, dark tunnel. Some lines are so steep that it is breathtaking; from the long end of the train, you can see the locomotive crawling under your feet. In such terrain, if you encounter a storm, even if you use the brakes to hold the wheels tightly, sometimes you cannot stop the train from rushing wildly. Some forest railways did not dare to run at night during the puppet Manchukuo era. However, now, the telephone rings and the urgent whistle sounds along its lines, day and night. In the dark night, where the sky and the earth are the same color, you will see a red star speeding from this mountain to that mountain. At the Mulantun repair shop of the Bajiazi Forest Railway, the wives and children of the craftsmen automatically come to the factory, carrying gas lamps to light up, so that their husbands and fathers can repair the locomotives in the ditch late at night. Workers circulate the deeds of their comrades, inspiring more new heroes and constantly creating new levels of transport capacity.
    After the Northeast Liberation Army's large-scale advance in October, many forest railway departments held meetings continuously, overcoming conservative thinking in technology and some work styles that did not delve into business. Many workers were racking their brains on how to further improve transportation capacity to catch up with the needs of the new situation. At a certain meeting, the issue of tripling the transportation capacity of this railway line made everyone use all their intelligence and talent. The participants were sweating anxiously. When they looked up, they saw Chairman Mao's photo. Some people thought this way: "Chairman Mao! You use your brains day and night, designing and leading our great plans. We thousands upon thousands of workers are also racking our brains day and night, trying to follow you in painstakingly setting our small plans. We must ensure the completion of our thousands upon thousands of small plans, to cooperate with your big plan and overthrow the reactionaries." The workers' genius creativity is brilliantly reflected here. The workers of a certain forest railway carefully formulated a plan that could exceed the task by three times, and the number of personnel required was much less than originally needed. Countless forest railway workers used such arduous labor, coupled with painstaking research and calculation, to welcome the victory of the national revolution.
    I recall the scene of rushing to complete the military task more than three months ago, which was on the eve of the liberation of the entire Northeast. The Harbin Forestry Bureau was lit up all night, and part of the Northeast Bureau's great strategic plan was being implemented here. The guarantee of supplying all the timber needed for rushing to repair the southern railway line was implemented here and conveyed to various forestry agencies and forest railways. Last October, I went to the Shanhetun Forest Railway, which was the time for rushing to get sleepers. Late one night, I heard the sound of the repair shop's motor, and I was very surprised, wondering if I had misheard. I groped my way to the factory and found that the workers had automatically opened the factory door and were working overtime. Songs mixed with the roar of chain beds, motors, and smelting furnaces. Under the flickering oil lamp, workers passing parts back and forth hurried back and forth. Wang Shiyi, a worker who operates a heavy oil engine, said to me: "Now the sleeper task is very tight. After we eat lunch, we call everyone to work the night shift. Everyone thinks: Chairman Mao led us to turn over, but there are still thousands upon thousands of worker brothers suffering in the hands of the reactionaries. We must step up our efforts so that all the people in China can turn over." The firelight of the smelting furnace illuminated his face, and in his simple smile shone the will of a common forest railway worker. The marching avenue for the liberation of the entire Northeast was obtained under this tenacious will, with the required sleepers, bridge timbers, and electric poles.
    A few days ago, in the deep mountains of Changbai Mountain, I climbed to the top of a pile of timber in a storage yard. Looking around, I saw that the timber, which was so thick that it took two people to hug, was piled up like a mountain. This is the people's precious wealth, and they are waiting for transportation schedules, and will soon appear all over the country.

　　在森林铁路线上
    陈生
    在一个森林铁路工人集会上，宣读着另一森林铁路线寄来的挑战书：
    “为了建设新东北和支援全国解放事业，……枕木，桥梁木，电杆，坑木，各种军工用材和建筑用材，一定得赶上全国的需要，这非得由咱们来保证不可，把木材运到关里去！………”
    灯光照着工人们兴奋的面孔，他们不知时间早晚地热烈地讨论着自己的应战计划。在郁郁苍苍无边无际的东北林区，在层层叠翠的万山丛中，蜿蜒着许多条修整的轻便铁路线，还是林务局直营，专门运输木材的森林铁路，它们象日夜输送新鲜血液的动脉管，将丰富的东北木材资源支援着全国的革命和建设事业。
    森林铁路工人牢牢地记着东北和全国的解放和建设都要求空前规模的物资供应，要求他们以自己一滴滴的汗换出每一立方米木材来保证完成它。这是用勇敢、智慧和艰苦的斗争战胜艰险的工程条件和恶劣气候的过程。铁路有时开在半山腰上，俯览谷底，可以见到密林静卧在脚下，有时还可以见到脚下矗立着烟筒——这是深山里的制材厂。线路曲折地由此山绕到另一山峰，有时还穿过幽长的山洞。有些线路的险陡是如此令人心悸，从长长的列车尾端，可以看到前面的机车正在脚下爬行。在这种地形如遇到暴风雨，即使用车闸把车轮死死地抱住，有时也不能制止列车的狂奔。有的森林铁路在伪满时代是不敢夜间行车的。然而现在，它的沿线各站彻夜不断地响着电话铃声和匆促的汽笛声。在天地混一色的暗夜，你会见到一颗红星从这山驰到那山的光。在八家子森林铁路木兰屯修车厂，工匠的妻子和儿女自动到工厂里来，提着瓦斯灯照亮，让自己的丈夫和父亲深夜钻在地沟里抢修机车。工人传诵着同伴的事迹，鼓舞着更多新的英雄，不断地创造着新的运输力水平。
    十月东北解放军大进军之后，许多森林铁路各部门都在不断地举行着会议，克服着技术上的守旧思想和某些不钻研业务的作风，许多工人，都在穷思苦想怎样才能进一步提高运输力赶上新形势的需要。在某一个会场上，把本铁路线运输力提高三倍的问题，使得每个人用尽了自己所有的聪明才智，参加会议的人急得出汗了，拾起头来，看见了毛主席的照片，有的人就这样想：“毛主席啊！你白天黑夜运用脑筋，设计着领导我们的伟大计划，我们千千万万工人也白天黑夜绞着脑筋，要跟着你苦心订我们的小计划，我们一定要保证完成我们千千万万个小计划，配合上你的大计划，把反动派打倒。”工人的天才创造力在这里光辉地体现着，某森林铁路的工人们精细地订出一个计划可以超过任务三倍，而需要的人员比原来需要的还要减少许多。无数森林铁路工人就是以这样艰巨的劳动加上苦心的钻研和计算，来迎接全国革命的胜利。
    我回想到三个多月前突击完成军事任务时的情景，那正是全东北解放的前夕。哈尔滨林务总局彻夜亮着灯光，东北局伟大战略计划的一部分在这里执行着，供应抢修南线铁路一切木材需要的保证，由这里贯彻到各林务机关各森林铁路。去年十月份我曾到山河屯森林铁路，那正是突击枕木的时候。在一个深夜，听到修车工厂的马达声，我很惊奇，疑是自己听错了，我摸索到工厂，发现工人自动打开工厂大门在加夜班，歌声混合着链床、马达、炼炉的一片轰响。油灯摇曳下，往来传递零件的工人来去匆匆。一位开重油机的工人王时义对我说：“现在枕木任务很紧，咱们吃过后晌饭就大伙招呼着来打夜班。大伙心想：毛主席领导咱们翻了身，可还有千千万万的工人哥们在反动派手里受罪，咱们得加紧努力，让全中国的老百姓都翻过身来。”炼炉的火光照亮了他的面孔，在他朴实的笑容里露耀着一个普遍森林铁路工人的意志，解放全东北的进军大道，就在这顽强的意志下得到了所需要的枕木、桥梁木和电柱。
    几天以前，我在长白山的深山里，攀登到一处储木场的一堆木材顶上，举目四望，见四周粗可两拖的木材堆积得象山一样。这是人民的宝贵财富，它们正等待运输的班次，不久就将出现在全国各地。
