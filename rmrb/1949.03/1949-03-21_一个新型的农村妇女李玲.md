A New Type of Rural Woman: Li Ling

In Li'an Village, first district of Hejian, there is a thirty-something woman named Li Ling, who is adept at farming and driving carts. With her labor, she supports her sixty-year-old mother-in-law and her eleven-year-old son, Xue Zeng, weathering the difficult years of flooding. Moreover, thanks to her hard work, their life has become more prosperous in recent years. Everyone in the village, young and old, is particularly familiar with and sincerely respects her. This is Comrade Li Ling, the women's affairs committee member of the Li'an Village branch and vice-chairman of the farmers' association. She is a new type of rural woman who has improved her social and political status through actively participating in production and living a good life.

From a young age, her parents died, and she lived a poor life with her aunt, often "begging for food." She married at seventeen into a poor family with only eleven mu of land. Her father-in-law and husband worked as laborers for others year-round, only managing to earn three mu of land in their lifetime. Her father-in-law and husband died one after another eight years ago, leaving her and her mother-in-law to raise her young child. She and her mother-in-law farmed the land, working half a day and then returning to eat a mouthful of bran cakes before going back to the fields.

She lives a very diligent and meticulous life, planning everything carefully. The yard and threshing ground are always swept clean. In the summer, when people take a midday break, she goes to the edge of the village to cut green grass, carrying basket after basket to the pigsty, and then splashing water on it. The villagers all say, "Look at Xue Zeng's mother, she really knows how to manage a household, even bringing soil and grass home." Therefore, her land is fertilized in both seasons, and her crops are better than anyone else's.

Li'an Village is often flooded. In the autumn, after the water recedes, people sow wheat, but they have to work barefoot in the mud. At that time, women were often ashamed to go barefoot, but she didn't care about that in order to make a living, and only by wading through the mud and water could the wheat be sown. Later, they bought a cow with others, and she learned to plow and drive the cart, gradually mastering all the work in the fields. When the wheat was ripe, she harvested her own wheat early and went to work for others as a contractor. One year, she and her mother-in-law, along with Gao Jinqi and his wife from the village, contracted to harvest several mu of wheat. The length and width of two rows equaled one mu of land, and Gao Jinqi couldn't keep up with her in the end. In the autumn, after finishing her own work, she went to sell short-term labor, chopping corn stalks for others, leading the group (foremen often tried to pay short-term laborers only half a day's wages), but she couldn't be held back at all.

Because of her diligent labor, she also educated her son very well. When Xue Zeng was eight years old, he could cut a basket of grass in half a day. Every morning, she would wake him up early to collect manure. Xue Zeng is eleven years old now and has never bought any snacks. Their clothes are all patched and worn, with no extravagance or wastefulness. Someone said, "How can a widow live such a hard life, what's the point?" She said, "My son is growing up, and the Kuomintang reactionaries are about to be finished. We actively engage in production, and when individuals become rich, the country will become strong! How can we not work hard?"

She has been a member of the Communist Party for five years and is currently the women's affairs committee member of the branch. During the land distribution, she was elected as a representative and later as the vice-chairman of the farmers' association. To ensure that the peasants are thoroughly liberated, she is busy with meetings and work day and night, but she has not forgotten personal production. As soon as a meeting ends, she goes to the fields, and she also spins yarn in her spare time to supplement the family income. During the land distribution, she was allocated two more mu of land, now totaling sixteen mu, which she cultivates entirely on her own. She has a large surplus of grain every year, and they can't finish eating all the pumpkins and beans, so life is getting better and better. The people of the whole village use her as an example to educate their children. Jia Xueren's mother once said to her daughter-in-law, "Look at Li Ling, she can handle affairs and farm the land, you should learn from her!"

　　一个新型的农村妇女李玲
    河间一区李庵村，有一个上尝下地、耕地、驶车全会的三十来岁的妇女，凭着她的劳动，养活着一个六十多岁的婆婆和一个刚十一岁的儿子——学增，渡过了水涝困难的年景，而且，由于她的劳动，近几年来日子更加富足了，村里无论大人孩子对她都特别的熟悉，和衷心的尊敬，这就是李庵村支部里的妇女委员和农会副主席李玲同志。她是由于积极参加生产过好光景，而提高了其社会政治地位的一个新型的农村妇女。
    从小她的爹娘就死了，跟着婶子过着穷苦的日子，经常“要饭”吃。十七岁就出嫁了，婆家也是个穷日子，仅有十一亩地，公公和丈夫整年价给人家扛活，一辈子才挣了三亩地。前八年公公和丈夫先后死了，她和婆婆守着自己的幼儿过日子，地里的活就是她和婆婆种着，做半天活回来吃口糠饽饽又下了地。
    她过日子非常勤苦，计划周密，院里场里总是扫的干干净净的。夏天人们歇晌的时候，她就到村边上铲青草，一筐一筐的挑到猪圈里，然后再泼上水。乡亲们都说：“你看学增他娘，真是过日子的人，连土草都弄到家里去”。因此，他的地一年两季都施粪，她的庄稼比谁家的地也收拾的好。
    李庵村常被水涝，秋天水澈了再耩麦子，可是人们得光着脚在泥里做活，那时，妇女们光着脚多嫌臊，但是她为了过日子，就顾不得这些了，经过泥里水里才能耩上麦子。后来打伙买了一头牛，自己就学着耕地、驶车，慢慢的地里的活都学会了。麦熟时，早早的把自己的麦子拔完，就去给人家包工，那一年她和婆婆还有本村高进启俩口子包拔几亩麦子，两个垄合一亩地的长阔，高进启到底没追上她。秋天她作完了自己的活，去卖短工，给人家砍棒子，领青的（一种领头作活的人常把短工拉的只挣半天工价，可是一点也拉不下她。
    由于她的勤苦劳动，对儿子的教育也很好，学增八岁时，就半天能割一筐草，每天早晨，早早的叫起他来去拾粪。学增十一岁了，从来没有买过一次零食吃。她们的衣服都是拆补着穿，从没有一点浮华浪费的地方。有人说：“一个寡妇家还过的那么上劲，可有什么过头？”她说：“儿子长大啦，国民党反动派也快完蛋啦，咱积极生产，个人富了，国家强啦！怎么能不上劲呢？”
    她已参加共产党五年了，现任支部妇女委员，平分时，被选为代表，后又被选为农会副主席。她为使农民彻底翻身，白天黑夜的忙着开会忙着工作，但她并未忘记个人生产。一散会就到地里去，抽空还纺线，供家里零花。平分中又分给了她二亩地，现在共十六亩地了，完全由她个人耕种着，每年的粮食都有很大富裕，北瓜豆角吃不完，日子愈过愈好起来，全村的人们都拿她教育自己的子女。贾学仁的母亲，有一次对她儿媳说：“你看人家李玲，又能办事，又能种地，得跟人家学呵！”
