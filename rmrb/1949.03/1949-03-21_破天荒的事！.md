　　An Unprecedented Event!
　　[Ping City News] The billing section of the Beiping branch of the Jibei Electric Power Company recently received a notice from the Beiping Garrison Headquarters in Tieshizi Hutong, requesting them to send someone to collect 400,000+ People's Currency for the electricity bills for February and March. Section Chief Fang was utterly bewildered upon receiving this notice, repeatedly saying, "This is an unprecedented event." Tieshizi Hutong was the former office location of the puppet Hebei Provincial Government, housing countless departments, and it was always a matter of passing the buck; no one ever paid the electricity bills. Even the meter readers had to be cautious when reading the meters. Now, besides the Beiping Garrison Headquarters, there are still many departments inside; however, the People's Government's Garrison Headquarters has agreed to fully settle the payments. Furthermore, they stated that how the various departments inside allocate the electricity costs is an internal matter for the Garrison Headquarters and has nothing to do with the Electric Power Company. In the future, all billing matters should be handled directly with the Garrison Headquarters.

　　破天荒的事！
    【平市讯】冀北电力公司北平分公司的收费股最近接到铁狮子胡同北平警备司令部的通知，请就派人去取二三月份两个月的电费人民券四十几万元。方股长接到这个通知，简直莫明其妙，连说“出了破天荒的事”。铁狮子胡同是原伪河北省政府办公处所，里面不知有多少机关，从来就是你推我，我推你，压根儿没有付过电费，连抄表员抄表时都得小心。现在里面除了北平市警备司令部外，也还是有不少机关；但是人民政府的警备司令部却答应完全由警备司令部清付。并且说住在里面的各机关如何摊分电费是警备司令部内部的事，与电力公司毫无关系，以后收费都向警备司令部接头就行。
