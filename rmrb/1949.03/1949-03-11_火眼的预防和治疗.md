　　Prevention and Treatment of Pinkeye

　　Among the common infectious diseases in spring, conjunctivitis (commonly known as pinkeye) is one of them. When infected with this eye disease, the conjunctival surface of the eye becomes red and swollen. In severe cases, the upper and lower eyelids also swell, the eyes are sensitive to light, there is frequent tearing, and "eye boogers" (eye discharge) are produced. The upper and lower eyelids are often stuck together by secretions, or swollen so that the eyes cannot be opened. There is also a burning sensation and blurred vision, with pain as if something is rubbing in the eyes. If you do not pay attention to treatment during this acute inflammation, or if it is not cured after a long time, it will turn into chronic conjunctivitis, which will be even more troublesome and difficult to treat.

　　The common prevention and treatment methods for this eye disease are as follows:

　　(1) Prevention: Prevent irritation from dust, smoke, toxic gases, or unclean air. Also, pay attention to the occurrence of this eye disease when digestion is poor, or when you have a cold, cough, or "internal heat."

　　(2) It is best to wear glasses when there is a strong wind to prevent dust and bacteria from entering the eyes.

　　(3) Do not rub your eyes with your hands. Use a soft, smooth, and clean towel to wipe them, to prevent dirt from your hands and towels from entering the eyes.

　　(4) It is advisable for each person to use a separate basin of water when washing the face. Sharing a basin easily spreads this eye disease or other eye diseases.

　　(5) Do not use public towels in restaurants or bathhouses to wash your face, to avoid being infected by patients.

　　(6) Do not read in sunlight or in darkness. If you find this eye disease or other acute infectious eye diseases, see a doctor immediately.

　　Treatment:

　　Applying a 0.5% to 2% silver nitrate solution to the eyes is most effective. Turn the upper and lower eyelids to expose the conjunctival surface and apply once a day, then wash with a 1% saline solution immediately after application. You can apply sulfa ointment at night when sleeping to prevent the harm of the upper and lower eyelids sticking together. If the swelling is severe, wash the eyes frequently with hot water, take sulfa drugs internally, and get plenty of rest.

　　火眼的预防和治疗
    春季常见传染性的疾病中，眼的结膜炎（俗名火眼）也是其中的一种。传染上这种眼病，眼结膜面发红发肿，在厉害时上下眼皮也肿起来，眼怕光，常流泪，生“吃马糊”（眼屎），上下眼睑常被分泌物粘住，或肿的睁不开眼。还有感觉灼热，看东西模糊、象有什么东西在眼里摩擦的疼痛。在这急性发炎时，要不注意去想法治，或经长日子治不好，就要转成慢性结膜炎，那就更加麻烦难治了。
    这种眼病普通的预防和治疗有下面几项：
    （一）预防：预防尘埃、烟、毒气或不清洁空气之刺激、在消化不好或伤风咳嗽上了火时，也注意这种眼病发生。
    （二）刮大风时，最好带上眼镜，以免尘土和细菌跑进眼里去。
    （三）不要用手擦眼，要用柔软、光滑、干净的手巾擦，免得手和手巾里的脏东西入眼。
    （四）洗脸时宜每人用一盆水，伙用一盆，很容易传染上这种眼病或别的眼病。
    （五）不用饭馆、澡堂、公用的手巾洗脸，以免受病人传染。
    （六）不在太阳光下看书，也不在黑暗处看书。发现这种眼病或别的急性传染眼病时，马上请医生看。
    治疗：
    可用百分之零点五到百分之二的硝酸银溶液点眼最有效。翻转上下眼皮，露出结膜面，一日点一次，点后即用百分之一食盐水洗，夜间睡觉时可涂苏尔发明软膏，以防上下眼皮粘住之害。浮肿厉害时，用热开水常洗眼，内服苏尔发明，并要多休息。
