　　Taiyue Xinhua Daily "Ask About Affairs" Column
  　Is Well-Received by Readers
    [Taiyue News] The "Ask About Affairs" column established by the Taiyue Xinhua Daily has indeed proven to be an important link in strengthening the connection between the Party newspaper and the masses. This column was created in April of last year and specializes in answering various questions raised by cadres and the masses. In the months since, the newspaper has received many problems reflected by readers from various places every day. In December and mid-January of last year alone, 402 items were received, of which no less than 83 were related to land reform and Party rectification. In particular, farmers from Qin County, Jincheng, Gaoping and other counties have made special trips to ask the "Ask About Affairs" column, reflecting the situation and seeking answers. What the masses ask about are mostly the government's attitude towards these issues; what cadres ask about are mostly their understanding and handling methods of certain policy issues. The following are issues relating to burden, marriage, illness, education, industry and commerce, and agricultural common knowledge. In order to make the newspaper's answers to the problems more correct, it has established close links with government agencies, hospitals, and farms, and specifically asked them to answer them before publishing them in the newspaper. For some specific problems of farmers, because the newspaper does not understand the details and cannot directly answer them, it entrusts the relevant local government agencies to investigate, answer and deal with them. Since its establishment, the "Ask About Affairs" column has won the welcome of a large number of readers in various places. For example, a comrade from the Yangcheng Third District Committee said: "The 'Ask About Affairs' column's answers to questions are indeed pertinent, concise and clear." Sun Renqiang, a comrade from the Taiyue District Branch of the People's Bank of China, wrote: "When the bank's cadres come, they all read the 'Ask About Affairs' column first. This is because it can clearly answer questions in concise words; on the other hand, it is easy to understand." This also shows that the "Ask About Affairs" column has become a close friend of the broad masses of readers. In order to make the "Ask About Affairs" column better, the newspaper has a comrade in the editorial department who is specifically responsible for this work, and the important issues of each issue are published in a prominent position on the page.

　　太岳新华日报问事栏
  　备受读者欢迎
    【太岳讯】太岳新华日报社所设立的“问事处”栏，确实证明了是加强党报与群众连系的重要一环。该栏在去年四月创办起，专门解答干部、群众提出的各种问题。数月以来，每天报社收到各地读者反映的问题甚多。仅去年十二月份一月中，即收到四百零二件，其中有关土地改革整党的即不下八十三件。特别是沁县、晋城、高平等县的农民，专门跑来问“问事处”，反映情况寻求解答。群众所问的多是政府对这些问题的态度；干部问的多是对某些政策问题的认识及处理方法。其次是负担、婚姻、疾病、教育、工商业及农业常识等问题。为了把报馆问题解答的更正确，曾和政权机关、医院、农场取得密切连系，专门请他们解答后在报纸发表。对于某些农民的具体问题，因报馆不了解详细情形，无法直接解答，即托有关各地区政府机关调查解答处理。“问事处”自创办后，即博得了各地广大读者的欢迎，如阳城三区分委会同志说：“‘问事处’解答问题确实中肯扼要明了”。人民银行太岳区行孙仁强同志来信说：“银行的干部，来了报纸都先看‘问事处’，这一面是由于它能在简短的文字里，明确地解答了问题；另方面，它通俗易懂。”这也说明“问事处”已成为广大读者群众的密友。报社为了把“问事处”办的更好，在编辑部内，专门设有负责这一工作的同志，每期的重要问题在版面上以显著地位发表。（李余学）
