　　[North Yue News] Yixian County's spring plowing preparations are nearing completion. The current production work, mainly involving delivering manure, gathering firewood, repairing canals and wells, tidying up fields, and harrowing land, has achieved great success. In the "Manure Delivery Blitz Week," most districts have already delivered their winter manure. The military families Li Luofu and Li Fushi in Xiluozhuang village were short of both manpower and livestock. Village cadres organized fourteen donkeys to deliver more than a hundred loads of manure for them in half a day. Xiao Luoyue, a 67-year-old man in Xiaoluo village, delivered 130 loads of manure to the fields himself and also applied top dressing to three mu of wheat. After delivering manure, farmers in the fourth district also applied top dressing to more than 300 mu of wheat. In addition, in the plains areas, soil for use in pigsties throughout the year has been hauled back home. While delivering manure, districts also gathered firewood. Women and children drove livestock to deliver manure, while able-bodied young men went to the mountains to gather firewood. Most villages in the eighth, ninth, and tenth districts have already gathered enough firewood for the whole year. Farmers in various villages are also responding to the county government's call to finish plowing the fallow land before spring plowing. According to statistics from four villages in the third district, thirty-five head of oxen are rushing to plow the fallow land. Matou village has already plowed more than 100 mu. Villages with water sources have begun to repair their fields in preparation for planting barley, and most wheat fields have been scraped into ridges and fertilized. Zhangjiazhuang in the third district has started digging wells. The Beidule Water Canal in the seventh district is under construction. In addition, the Production Promotion Cooperative has prepared more than 10,000 jin of peanut seeds to be loaned to farmers who lack seeds. The county government has called on the entire county to plant ten hemp seeds per person. At production meetings in various districts, villages have made competitive proposals to each other. When Xiaozhai village in the fourth district issued a challenge, Zhao Jiagou and seven other villages immediately responded. In order to reward production models, the district has made a "Glorious Model" flag and a model plaque, calling on villages to set off a wave of production enthusiasm.
