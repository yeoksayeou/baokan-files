　　Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 18th. To welcome this year's "May 1st" Labor Day, production competitions have begun in some state-owned enterprises in the Northeast, including railways, mines, power, and textiles. Among the employees of the fourteen factories directly under the Harbin Office of the Northeast Railway Workers' Union, the production competition has expanded from within factories to between factories. For example, the Electrical Repair Factory initiated competitions between individuals and between groups; at the same time, it challenged factories such as the Electrical Glue Factory and the Oxygen-Coke Factory, with the condition that the factory plans to complete four months of work in two, three, and four months, improve quality, and reduce consumption. After the challenge letter was sent to each factory, the Oxygen-Coke Factory workers responded first, guaranteeing to complete the original plan to produce 1,530 tons of coke in three months within two months, and increase the oxygen production from 190 kilograms per day to 201 kilograms. The Electrical Glue Factory also proposed to complete four months of production plans in three months and improve quality standards. The production merit campaign in the entire Northeast No. 1 Coal Mine area also started in mid-February. The Communist Party Committee, the administration, and the trade union of the mining area jointly formed merit evaluation committees at all levels of the mine, district, pit, factory, and share, recording merits according to events at any time, and regularly evaluating and rewarding merits. Mines, pits, and shares whose production exceeds the predetermined amount by 10% and whose oil content in coal quality is below 3% can be rewarded. Since the launch of the merit competition on February 1st by the Jilin Electric Power Bureau and its affiliated offices and factories, the work efficiency of employees has improved significantly. Production competition movements in other state-owned enterprises in various places are also being actively prepared. The Preparatory Committee of the Shenyang Municipal Federation of Trade Unions has decided to prepare for production competitions in factories with conditions for launching production competitions in March, so as to start the competition in April. The Trade Unions of Jilin and Heilongjiang Provinces have decided to use March as a time for mobilizing and brewing ideas in various state-owned enterprises to create a plan, and officially launch the competition in April and May.

　　迎接“五一”劳动节
  　东北各企业展开生产竞赛
    职工工作效率有显著提高
    【新华社沈阳十八日电】迎接今年“五一”劳动节的生产大竞赛，已在东北的部分铁路、矿山、电业、纺织等公营企业中开始展开。在东北铁路职工总会哈尔滨办事处直属的十四个工厂职工中，生产竞赛已由厂内扩及各厂之间。如电气修缮厂在个人与个人、小组与小组间发起竞赛；同时，又向电胶、氧焦等厂提出挑战，其条件是该厂拟在二、三、四三个月内完成四个月的工作任务，并提高质量，减少消耗。挑战书送至各厂后，氧焦厂职工首先应战，保证在两个月内完成原订三个月生产焦炭一千五百三十吨的计划，将氧气生产量从每天一百九十千克提高到二百零一千克。电胶厂亦提出了在三个月内完成四个月的生产计划及提高质量的标准。东北第一煤矿区全矿区的生产立功运动也于二月中旬开始。矿区中共党委、行政、职工会联合组成了矿、区、坑、厂、股各级评功委员会，随时按事记功，定期评功奖励。凡生产量超过预定量百分之十，煤质方面石油在百分之三以下的矿、坑、股都能获得奖励。吉林电业局所属各所各厂自二月一日展开立功竞赛后，职工工作效率已有显著提高。其他各地公营企业的生产竞赛运动亦正积极准备发动中。沈阳市职工总会筹委会已决定于三月份在有发动生产竞赛条件的工厂作好生产竞赛的准备工作，以便四月开始进行竞赛。吉林、黑龙江两省职工总会均决定在各公营企业中以三月份为动员中思想酝酿，制造计划时间，四、五两月正式开展竞赛。
