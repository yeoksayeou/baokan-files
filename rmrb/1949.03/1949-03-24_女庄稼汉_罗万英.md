　　"Female Farmer" Luo Wanying

    "One jin of cotton turned into eleven shi of rice" is the production achievement of Luo Wanying, a female labor hero from Jiexiu in 1947. Her maiden family were tenant farmers in Beili Village, Jiexiu. At the age of five, due to financial hardship, she was given as a child bride to Wang Bangning’s family in the old fortress of Ze. At sixteen, she got married. From then on, the family of four struggled to survive by cultivating two mu of hillside land each year.

    In the spring of 1946, the village launched a mass movement. Wanying was very active and reclaimed the four mu of good land that had been seized by the landlord Wang Qixiang over the years. With these four mu of land "returned to their original owner," Wanying's production enthusiasm also increased. She learned to spin and spun thread for others, earning half a jin for every jin spun. She sold the thread spun from the first jin of cotton and then bought more cotton. After several such "transactions," by April, one jin of cotton had become six jin and eleven liang. As the season was about to change, Wanying spun her cotton into thread and wove twelve zhang of cloth, which she sold. She didn't take cash at the time but agreed to be paid in wheat. Just after the summer harvest, Luo Wanying's twelve zhang of cloth turned into two shi and two dou of wheat. The wheat kernels, as small as ants, looked good and tasted good, but Wanying was reluctant to eat them. After drying them in the sun, she stored them in jars. During the wheat harvest, Wanying left early and returned late to glean wheat, collecting eight dou in half a month. During the autumn harvest, Wanying didn't use anyone. She went to the fields herself and harvested and threshed the crops from her six mu. After the autumn harvest, the men in the village all drove livestock to the mountains to sell charcoal. She was very envious, so she bought a donkey with her three shi of wheat and some money from a neighbor. Even in the coldest days of winter, Wanying braved the cold and drove the donkey to sell charcoal in the mountains. At first, she was still "shy," but over time, she got used to it and didn't worry about it.

    Several times, because she returned too late, she was a bit scared alone. Later, she brought the wife of her neighbor, Mao Ze, along as a companion. She even took off her wool vest and gave it to this woman to wear. As a result, this pair of partners became more and more familiar and their enthusiasm increased. One charcoal selling trip earned them ten jin of salt. In less than three months, Wanying made a net profit of five hundred jin of salt per person, excluding food and expenses. She then transported the salt to Wanghe to buy millet, exchanging it for eleven shi of millet. By the twelfth lunar month, when she "totaled up" her production, one jin of cotton had turned into eleven shi of millet. Her experience is: seize the time, and be diligent.

    Due to her diligence and thrift, she became famous far and wide, especially in the newly liberated Jinzhong New District, where women admired her even more. As such, "Female Farmer" Luo Wanying was honored as an alternate representative of the Jinzhong District to the National Women's Congress.

　　“女庄稼汉”罗万英
    加里 
    “一斤花变成十一石米”是介休女劳动英雄罗万英一九四七年的生产成绩。她娘家是介休北里村的佃户，五岁上，因生活所迫童养给旧塞则王邦宁家，十六上结了婚。从此全家四口人，每年刨上二亩坡地过着苦日子。
    一九四六年春天村里搞群众运动，万英很积极，把几年来被地主王齐祥夺去的四亩好地也收回来，这四亩地又“物归原主”，万英的生产情绪也随着提高。她学会纺织给别人纺线，纺一斤赚半斤，把第一次赚下的一斤花纺成线卖了再换成花，这么几次“倒腾”，赶四月一斤花变成六斤十一两。这时快要换季，万英就把她的花纺成线织了十二丈布卖了，当时没要现钱就说成麦子，刚收了夏，罗万英的十二丈布又变成二石二斗麦子。蚂蚁大的麦颗，好看又好吃，可是万英舍不得吃掉，晒干后装在瓮里保存起来。割麦时，万英早出晚归拾麦子，半个月功夫拾下八斗。收秋时，万英没用人，自己下地把六亩庄稼收割回来打了。秋罢村里的男子汉们都赶上牲口到山下卖炭，他很羡慕，就把自己的三石麦子和邻家伙买了一头驴子，在“数九”天，万英也不顾寒冷赶上驴子到山下卖炭，起先还“害羞”，日子一久就习以为常不打帐了。
    有几次因为回来的太迟，一个人有些害怕，后来她就把邻家卯则的女人也引上作伴，连自己的毛背心也脱给这个女人穿，这样一对伙伴，越相跟越熟，情绪更高，卖一次炭换回十斤盐，不到三个月，万英一人一份，除吃喝花费外，净赚五百斤盐，又把盐驮到王和去买，换回十一石小米。到腊月，把自己的生产一“结挽”，一斤花就变成小米十一石，她的经验是：抓紧时间，勤劳动弹。
    由于她勤俭劳动，远近闻名，尤其在刚解放不久的晋中新区里，妇女们更是羡慕她，这样“女庄稼汉”罗万英荣膺了晋中区参加全国妇代大会的后补代表。
