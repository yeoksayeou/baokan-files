Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 16th: TASS, New York—The eighth session of the UN Economic and Social Council has begun discussing the attacks on the rights of labor masses and trade unions in several countries. The first report made by the World Federation of Trade Unions (WFTU) in June last year concerned the suppression of trade union movements in countries such as Argentina, Brazil, Burma, Chile, Egypt, Spain, India, Greece, Iran, Portugal, and the Union of South Africa. The report pointed out that Brazil, Argentina, and certain other countries only allow trade union activities under government control. This enables the government to suppress strikes and "reorganize" trade unions under various pretexts. Regarding Egypt, the report indicated that political police agencies are controlling trade unions, providing employers with blacklists of workers engaged in political activities. The report detailed the terror methods used by the Greek government against trade union leaders and the persecution of trade union leaders and active members of the All-India Trade Union Congress by the Indian government. The chairman of the All-India Trade Union Congress and WFTU Executive Committee member, Gangji, and 15,000 others were arrested for engaging in trade union activities. Despite the WFTU's strong protest to Prime Minister Nehru, the Indian government still did not allow Gangji to attend the WFTU Executive Committee meeting held in Rome last May. The report also stated that serious persecution and assassination actions have occurred against trade union leaders in Spain, where workers' organizations legalized by the fascist authorities are directly controlled by the state and are an inseparable part of the "labor-management association system" borrowed from fascist Italy and Hitler's Germany. On February 14th this year, the WFTU submitted a supplementary report, including new facts received from trade union organizations in Chile, Greece, India, and Iran, as well as materials on the special suppression of trade unions by the governments of Lebanon and Cuba. The recent attempt by the Chilean government to suppress the trade union struggle has failed. The main points of this attempt were to throw 1,500 trade union activists into prison and execute exiled persons who were subjected to inhuman treatment. In early 1947, the Cuban government attempted to dissolve the Cuban Workers' Confederation, occupying the headquarters of the Confederation's Executive Committee, and carrying out mass arrests and assassinations of workers and trade union leaders, especially the assassination of the General Secretary of the National Sugar Workers' Union, Mendes, and the dockworkers' union leader, Jian Laselio Iglesias. The report also mentioned the "trial" and death sentences of ten Greek sailors, regarding which the WFTU appealed to the United Nations to find a way to cancel their death sentences.

During the discussion, Polish representative Kazsuchi said that the WFTU had omitted the most vicious country in undermining trade union power—the United States—from its list. He pointed out that there were instances of suppressing workers' rights in the United States, Chile, Greece, India, and other countries. He urged the Economic and Social Council to adopt the Soviet proposal, which supports the WFTU's condemnation of the aforementioned countries and requires UN member states to submit reports to the Economic and Social Council on the measures taken to improve this situation. The U.S. representative, in addition to slandering the trade unions of the Soviet Union and the new democracies, suggested that this issue be handled by the International Labor Organization, which is controlled by employers. Indian representative Sun, in addressing the report's condemnation of the Indian government, raised various procedural questions, attempting to divert the Council's attention from these condemnations. He groundlessly denied that 15,000 people had been arrested and imprisoned for engaging in trade union activities, while also attempting to defend the mass arrests of workers who were planning to strike on government railways.

    波代表指出美欺压工人最凶
    【新华社陕北十六日电】塔斯社纽约讯：联合国经社理事会第八次会议，开始讨论若干国家对劳动群众职工会权利的进攻。世界工联于去年六月作出的第一个报告，是关于阿根廷、巴西、缅甸、智利、埃及、西班牙、印度、希腊、伊朗、葡萄牙和南非联邦等国对职工运动的镇压行为。该报告指出：巴西、阿根廷及其他某些国家只在政府控制的条件下，才准许职工会活动。这便使政府可以利用种种借口镇压罢工和“改组”职工会。关于埃及，该报告指出政治警察机构在控制职工会，把从事政治活动的工人黑名单供给雇主机关的特别作用。该报告详述希腊政府用以对付职工会领袖的恐怖方法和印度政府对工会领袖与全印职工大会积极分子的迫害。全印职工大会主席并世界工联执委冈吉及一万五千人因从事工会活动被捕。不顾世界工联对尼赫鲁总理所提的强硬抗议，印度政府仍然不准冈吉参加去年五月在罗马召开的世界工联执委会会议。该报告又称：在西班牙发生了对职工会领袖的严重迫害与谋杀行动，那里被法西斯当局合法化了的工人组织，是直接由国家控制，并且是从法西斯意大利与希特勒德国借来的“劳资联合会制度”不可分的一部份。今年二月十四日世界工联提出一个补充报告，包括从智利、希腊、印度与伊朗各国职工会组织收到的新的事实，以及关于黎巴嫩与古巴政府对职工会实行特别镇压的材料。最近智利政府镇压工会斗争的企图已遭失败，这种企图的要点即将一千五百名工会积极会员投进监狱，并把受非人待遇的被放逐者处死，远在前年初，古巴政府就已企图解散古巴工人联合会，那时它占领了该联合会执行委员会会所，大批逮捕与谋杀工人和工会领袖，特别是谋杀了全国糖业工人联合会总书记孟德·德斯与码头工会领袖鉴拉塞利奥·伊格莱斯拉斯。该报告又说到十名希腊水手被“审讯”和被判死刑；关于这事，世界工联曾呼吁联合国，设法取消他们的死刑。
    在讨论中，波兰代表卡资苏契说：世界工联在其所列举的名单中漏掉破坏职工会权力最凶恶的国家—美国。他指出美国、智利、希腊、印度及其他国家有压制工人权利的情形。他力促经社理事会通过苏联的提案，即支持世界工联对上述各国的谴责，并要求联合国各会员国就改善这种情形所采取的措施，向经社理事会提出报告。美国代表除诽谤苏联及新民主主义各国的职工会外，建议将这一问题交由为雇主所控制的国际劳工机构处理。印度代表孙氏在谈到报告中谴责印度政府的内容时，提出各种各样的程序问题，企图转移理事会对于这些谴责的注意。他毫无根据地否认一万五千人因从事工会活动被捕入狱，同时并企图辩护大规模逮捕预计在政府铁路上进行罢工的工人。
