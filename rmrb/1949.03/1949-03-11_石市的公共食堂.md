The Victory Restaurant, a guest house of the municipal government, has been piloting a public dining hall using its original furniture. Initially, it was initiated by the Finance Bureau with only four units participating. Over the past two months, it has gradually increased to twelve units, with a total of over 150 cadres and staff members joining.

The dining hall has three administrators, eight cooks, and one food representative selected from each participating unit to assist in management.

The dining hall has an attached warehouse department, and all income is used for various expenses such as personnel and sundries of the dining hall. It is stipulated that 75 jin of rice per month is required for the large mess and 110 jin for the medium mess. Those on a salary system pay the above amount according to the monthly rice price assessed by the Civil Affairs Bureau.

The dining hall has more members than general food units, and it often controls more materials, which is not affected by price fluctuations. These conditions guarantee that the dining hall is better run than the original meals in each unit.

Large mess: Breakfast is pickled vegetables and rice porridge, dinner is pickled vegetables and rice porridge, with two cornbread buns for each person. Lunch is steamed buns every other day, and cornbread buns on ordinary days. Vegetables include soybeans, cabbage, tofu, vermicelli, etc., with two dishes for each lunch.

Medium mess: Breakfast is pickled vegetables and rice porridge, dinner is pickled vegetables and rice porridge, plus a stir-fried dish, and two steamed buns for each person. Lunch is steamed buns or noodles, with four dishes, occasionally with meat.

The dining hall provides appropriate care for the sick. Those who arrive at the dining hall one hour after the scheduled meal time due to official business must be certified by the food representative of each unit, and private matters are not considered after one hour. The number of people per table is not fixed, and they can eat as they arrive within the prescribed time. If there is a surplus, it will be used to improve meals.

The Victory Restaurant has limited space, and the current number of diners is already crowded, so it has recently stopped accepting requests to join. The following problems have been identified that still need to be resolved:

First: Meal fees cannot be collected on time. Because each participating unit first receives supplies from the Finance Bureau and then gives them to the dining hall. In the future, the dining hall can directly collect them uniformly, or adopt the method of pre-paying a certain percentage and setting a deadline for payment. Second: The food representatives of each unit were originally scheduled to meet once a week, but they did not fulfill this on time. Few problems were solved after several meetings. Since the opening, all accounts have not been settled. It is estimated that there will be no deficit. Third: Generally, comrades who have joined hope that the cooking of dishes and rice can be more varied, and not always steamed buns and cornbread buns, and also hope that the quantity of dishes can be increased. Fourth: Some comrades are not used to three meals a day, which is very related to running around. Many do not eat breakfast. The comrades from the Civil Education First Branch on Liming Street in Qiaoxi and Jiefang Street in Qiaodong have to walk twenty miles back and forth for three meals a day, wasting too much energy and time. This problem can only be solved after public dining halls are generally established throughout the city.

### 石市的公共食堂

　　石市的公共食堂
    市府招待所——胜利饭店，利用原有的家具试办了公共食堂，最初是由财政局发起的只有四个单位参加，两个月来已逐渐增加到十二个单位，入伙的干部职工共一百五十余人。
    食堂有三个管理员，八个炊事员，另有各入伙单位选派伙食代表一人，协助管理。
    食堂附设有货栈部，收入全部用于食堂人员杂用等各项开支，规定入大灶每月七十五斤米，中灶一百一十斤。薪给制的按照社会局每月评定的米价交付上数。
    食堂入伙人数较一般伙食单位人数多，经常掌握有较多物资，不受物价影响，这些条件保证了食堂较各单位原来伙食办得要好。
    大灶：早餐咸菜稀饭，晚餐咸菜稀饭，每人另有两个窝窝头；午餐隔天一顿馒头，平常窝窝头。菜蔬有黄豆、白菜、豆腐、粉条等，中午每餐两样菜。
    中灶：早餐咸菜稀饭，晚餐咸菜稀饭，另炒一盘熟菜，每人两个馒头；午餐馒头或面条，四盘菜，偶而有荤。
    对病号，食堂有适当照顾。因公在规定开饭时间一小时后到食堂的，得由各单位伙食代表证明，私事过一小时不管。每桌人数不定，在规定时间内随到随吃。若有节余，将用作改善伙食。
    胜利饭店的房屋有限，现在吃饭人数已感到很挤，因此最近不再接收请求入伙的人。发现食堂尚有以下几个待解决的问题：
    第一：饭费不能按时收齐。因入伙各单位都是先向财政局领了供给，再交给食堂。以后可改由食堂统一直接领取，或者采取预交几成及限期交费的方法。第二：各单位伙食代表，原定每周集会一次，没有按时履行，开过几次会很少解决什么问题，自开办以来，全部帐目还没有结算过。估计不至于亏空。第三：一般入伙同志，希望菜饭做法能多变些花样，不要老是馒头窝窝头，菜的数量也希望再增加一些。第四：一部分同志对三顿饭不太习惯，这与跑路很有关系，很多都不吃早饭。食堂在桥西黎明街，桥东解放大街民教一分馆的同志们，每天三餐来回，得走二十里路，精力时间浪费太大，这个问题，要待全市普设食堂后才能解决。
