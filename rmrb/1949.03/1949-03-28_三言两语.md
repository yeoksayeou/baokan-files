　　A Few Words

　　　　Pay Close Attention to the Spring Famine

　　Some areas of North China are experiencing a spring famine this year. Party, government, and people in all areas should promptly pay attention to discovering and extinguishing it, and prevent it from becoming a disaster. The reasons for the spring famine are: a large part of the areas are due to just being liberated, and the spring famine is a criminal trace left by the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang. Places like the counties in northern Henan and south of the Yellow River, and Chahar, have many long-term ravaged people without clothing or food. The democratic government has previously allocated a large amount of grain and funds to carry out necessary relief, and they have already recovered. Now that spring plowing is approaching, it is also necessary to help them with food, farm tools, and seeds, and organize them to save themselves, not miss the farming season, and use the greatest strength to turn to production and rebuild their homes; in another small part of the area, it is due to the poor harvest last year, and some people do not have enough food. As long as the government is always vigilant and pays serious attention, and uses various methods to adjust part of the food supply, the difficulties of spring plowing can definitely be solved. Chahar's method is good, but after solving the immediate difficulties, it is necessary to organize farmers to produce and save themselves in a planned way to get through the spring famine.

　　　　Strike First

　　Locust nymphs emerge from the soil, and pear maggots emerge from trees. Insect plagues have been discovered in western Hebei and other places. This is a warning sign on this year's production front! Last winter was warm, and winter plowing and turning the soil were not widespread enough. This year's insect plague should be given serious attention. Last year's experience proves that the spread of insect plagues will cause great losses in agricultural production. All regions should carefully summarize past experiences, strike first, and wherever insect pests are found, immediately organize manpower and use a large number of indigenous methods, even if it is a village, a household, or a mu of land, as long as insect pests are found, they must be extinguished in a timely manner, and it is absolutely not allowed to spread and develop! Agricultural scientists in the entire region and the Tianjin area should be mobilized to conduct on-the-spot investigations and study effective methods for prevention and eradication.

　　　　Punish Corrupt Elements

　　Recently, this newspaper has continuously revealed that some economic workers have abused their powers and taken advantage of their convenient conditions to embezzle and become corrupt and do evil. Like Feng Huaiyi, the head of the ironwork section of the Yangquan Railway Bureau, who exploited workers and defrauded the public, and Zhao Zhenbin, a purchasing staff member of the Hebei-Shandong-Henan Military Industry Department, whose crime was published in this newspaper yesterday, these illegal behaviors are individual phenomena among economic workers, but if they are not strictly curbed, they will cause danger in today's new situation! These corrupt elements are pests in the construction of the New Democracy and must be severely punished and dealt with according to the severity of their crimes. In fundamental aspects, we should rectify the ranks of economic departments, prevent bad people from mixing in, universally carry out ideological examinations, and strengthen education and strict discipline.

　　三言两语
            密切注意春荒
    华北今年部份地区有春荒，各地党政民应及时注意发现扑灭，勿使成患。春荒发生的原因：一大部份地区是由于刚刚解放，春荒是国民党反动统治所遗留的罪恶痕迹，象豫北、黄河南岸各县、察哈尔等地，那里有着许多无衣无食的长期被蹂躏的人民，民主政府过去曾大量拨粮拨款进行了必要的救济，他们已经复苏了。现在春耕已届，还要帮助食粮、农具、种籽、组织他们自救，不误农时，用最大力量转入生产，重建家园；在另一小部份地区则由于去年歉收，部份人民食粮不足，只要政府时时警惕，认真注意，用各种办法调剂部分食粮，春耕困难一定可以解决。察哈尔的办法是好的，但在解决了眼下困难之后，必须有计划地组织农民生产自救，渡过春荒。
    　　　　先下手为强
    蝗蝻出土，梨狗出树。冀西等地发现虫灾。这是今年生产战线上一个警号！去冬天暖，冬耕翻地不够普遍，今年虫灾亟应严重予以重视。去年经验证明，虫灾蔓延会造成农业生产上的极大损失。各地应很好总结过去经验，先下手为强，凡发现有虫害的地方，要立即组织人力，大量使用土法，那怕是一村、一户、一亩地，只要发现了虫灾，就要及时扑灭，绝不允许任其蔓延发展！全区以及平津一带的农业科学工作者，应动员起来进行实地考察，研究预防以及扑灭的有效办法。
    　　　　惩办贪污腐化分子
    最近本报连续揭载了某些经济工作人员滥用职权，借着自己某些方便条件，贪污腐化，为非作歹，象今天发表的阳泉市铁路局铁工股长冯怀义剥削工人坑骗公家，以及昨天本报发表的冀鲁豫军工部采购人员赵振宾枉法罪案，这些非法行为在经济工作人员中虽是个别现象，但如不严加制止，在今天新的情况下会造成危险！这些贪污腐化分子是新民主主义建设中的害虫，必须严厉惩办，按其罪恶大小，分别依法处理。基本方面则应整饬经济部门阵容，勿使坏人混入，普遍开展思想检查，加强教育及严格纪律。
