　　Jizhong Clothing Bureau's Production Competition for Three Months
　　Completes Over 100,000 Sets of Single Uniforms
　　[Jizhong News] Under the leadership of the Party and administrative leaders, and the guidance of the trade union, all employees of the Jizhong Logistics Clothing Bureau launched a spring clothing production competition. In three months, they completed 100,9328 sets of military uniforms, exceeding the plan by 34,858 sets. Each machine increased from making ten sets per day to more than sixteen sets per day. In two months, they dyed 200,090 bolts of cloth, exceeding the original plan by 43,090 bolts. In terms of finished product quality, the general requirements were met, achieving more than thirteen stitches per inch. The unfolding of this spring clothing production movement first overcame ideological obstacles. Before launching the production competition, some ideological problems existed among some workers: thoughts of returning home, a hired labor mentality, a loose lifestyle, and failure to comply with working hours. In addition, the leadership was not deep enough, and some cadres did not care about the workers' hardships, which made some workers dissatisfied and less enthusiastic about their work. Under the leadership of the Party and the trade union, Party members and workers made sincere self-criticisms, and also raised many opinions about the leadership, which also made self-criticisms. After this meeting, the factory's production enthusiasm and discipline improved a step, and the entire bureau took on a new look.
　　Next, the leadership proposed launching the "Four Competitions" movement: competing in quality, competing in technology, competing in labor discipline, and competing in production leadership and control. Increase quantity on the basis of improving quality, and correct the past tendency of emphasizing quantity and neglecting quality. Then, the workers of each factory put forward slogans based on their own work: the tailoring group put forward "Cut quickly, quality is good, buttonholes are not returned for rework, cherish public property is the most important"; the sewing group put forward "Step firmly, be clear-headed, strengthen quality and increase quantity." Other groups also put forward slogans, and a heated challenge was launched between factories, between groups, and between individuals. Everyone's slogan was "Supply in time, make good military uniforms, and make the soldiers satisfied when they wear them." Workers at the Second Factory voluntarily requested to add two hours of night work every day. Party member worker Zhang Jiawei went to work before his eye disease had healed. In December, they received an urgent task to complete fifty pairs of cotton shoes in three days, and everyone unanimously proposed: No rest on Sunday, work overtime to guarantee completion. More than sixty-year-old veteran workers voluntarily went to work despite illness, and everyone took turns eating and resting. Liu Yucheng, an old man at the Fourth Factory, increased from cutting fifteen pairs per day to eighteen pairs. Su Yinglin, a sleeve sewer in the First Factory, increased from sewing one hundred pieces per day to one hundred and sixty pieces. The Second Factory increased from producing five hundred sets of military uniforms per day to nine hundred sets. Requiring thirteen stitches per inch can now be achieved, and some can achieve sixteen stitches.
　　At the same time, under the leadership of the bureau, a system of mutual supervision and inspection of products was established. In the beginning, a phenomenon of confrontation between workers and inspectors was discovered. The workers believed that the inspection was "nitpicking." After education, this incorrect attitude was changed, and the inspection was deepened, and a mass mutual inspection was formed, followed by technical personnel inspection.
　　The leadership gave spiritual and material rewards to those who achieved success in improving quality and quantity, and criticized those who cut corners and did not maintain product quality. It formulated a table for exchanging information on the work of each factory, and every week, the work, quality, quantity, savings, and other information of each factory were disseminated to each factory. Each factory established a wall newspaper to promptly reflect the workers' production, life, learning, and opinions, which promoted the development of the competition.

　　冀中被服局生产竞赛三个月
  　完成单军装十余万套
    【冀中讯】冀中后勤被服局全体职工，在党及行政领导与工会的指导下，掀起了春装生产竞赛运动，三个月完成军服十万零九千三百二十八套，超过计划三万四千八百五十八套，每架机子由每天做十套增到每天做十六套多，两个月染布廿万零九十匹，超过原计划四万三千零九十匹。在成品质量上，一般的达到了要求，一寸内作到十三针以上。这次春装生产运动的展开，首先是克服了思想障碍，在开展生产竞赛以前，某些工人中存在着一些思想问题：回家思想、雇佣观点、生活散漫、不遵守劳动时间，加上领导上不够深入，某些干部不关心工人疾苦，因此使有些工人不满，工作不大起劲。在党和工会领导下，党员和工人都作了虚心的检讨，对领导上也提了不少意见，领导上也作了自我检讨。经过这次会议以后，全厂生产积极性和纪律性提高了一步，全局出现了新面貌。
    接着，领导上提出开展“四赛”运动。赛质量、赛技术、赛劳动纪律、赛生产的领导与掌握。在提高质量基础上提高数量，纠正过去存在的重量轻质的倾向。接着各厂工人根据自己工作提出口号：剪裁组提出“剪的快，质量好，扣活的不回找，爱惜公物最重要”；缝纫组提出“登的稳，手头清，质量加强数量升”。其他各组也提出口号，厂与厂、组与组、个人与个人掀起了热烈的挑战，大家的口号是“及时供给，做好军衣，叫战士穿上满意”。二厂工人自动要求每天增加两小时夜工。党员工人张家伟，眼病没好就上了工。十二月份接到了三天完成五十双棉鞋的紧急任务，大家一致提出：礼拜不休息，打夜工保证完成。六十多岁老工人都自动带病上工，大家轮流换班吃饭，歇人不歇马。四厂切底老人刘玉晨由每天切十五双增到十八双。一厂缝袖工人苏英林由每天缝一百件增到一百六十件。二厂由每天出军衣五百套增到九百套。要求一寸内做十三针，现在都能达到，有的做到十六针。
    同时，在局的领导下树立了产品的互相督促检查制度。开始时曾发现了工人与检查员对立的现象，工人认为检查是“找岔”，经教育后，这种不正确态度转变了，检查才深入下去，并形成了群众性的互相检查，最后技术员检查。
    领导上对提高质量数量有成绩的予以精神及物质奖励，对偷工减料不保持产品质量的予以批评，制订了各厂工作情况交流表，每礼拜将各厂之工作、质量、数量节约等情况，传播各厂，各厂建立墙报。及时反映工人的生产、生活、学习情况、意见，推动了竞赛的开展。
