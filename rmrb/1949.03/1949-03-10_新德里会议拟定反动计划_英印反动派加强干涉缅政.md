Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 5th—Reports from various sources: The New Delhi Conference, where British and Indian reactionaries are strengthening interference in Burma's internal affairs, was held in New Delhi on February 28th. Attendees included the British Secretary for Overseas Trade, Bottomley, the British High Commissioner for Southeast Asia, MacDonald, the British High Commissioner for Ceylon, de Silva, and Indian Prime Minister Nehru. New Zealand and Pakistan, invited by India, did not send representatives. According to a Reuters report on the 2nd, the New Delhi Conference ostensibly aimed to discuss the Burmese situation and the issue of Burmese rice exports. In reality, the purpose of the conference was to formulate certain plans, one of which might stipulate the use of Gurkha troops or British troops if the Burmese government is unable to suppress the growing people's revolutionary movement. The conference communique revealed that the conference has decided to make certain recommendations to Thakin Nu regarding the peaceful mediation of the Burmese situation. These recommendations are clearly intended to politically dismember Burma, strengthen control over various separate puppet regimes, and suppress the people's revolutionary movement. According to a UPI report from London on the 1st, support for the Karen people in Burma from within the British Parliament is growing. Senior officials from the headquarters of the former British Commander-in-Chief of Southeast Asia, Mountbatten, have made recommendations to the British government, strongly advocating allowing the Karen people to have separate autonomy within the Union of Burma, while emphasizing that they do not support the Thakin Nu government. It is understood that this recommendation will form the basis for the mediation proposals put forward by the New Delhi Conference.
