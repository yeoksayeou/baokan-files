　　Shijiazhuang City Farmers' Service Center Works Actively
　　Farmers Feel Convenient Entering the City
　　[Our Newspaper] In order to solve the difficulties for farmers in purchasing goods and selling produce in the city, the Shijiazhuang Cooperative Headquarters specially established a Farmers' Service Center on Quanxing Street in the east of the bridge. In the ten days since its establishment, it has been enthusiastically serving farmers and communicating the relationship between urban and rural areas, which has been supported and endorsed by the majority of farmers. The center has conducted publicity in villages and towns in nearby counties, established preliminary contact in eleven villages, and farmers have already begun to come to the city to ask the service center to handle matters for them. Chen Lao You, introduced from Lecheng Temple Shang Village, wanted to buy Western medicine, and the service center took care of it for him. This old man also wanted to buy some bran, and the lowest price he inquired about in the market was 43 yuan new currency per jin. He came back and asked the service center to handle it, and the service center only charged him 30 yuan per jin at the state-owned Yumin Company. Before leaving, he gratefully said: "You are really doing things for us farmers. I will bring wheat to exchange in the future, and I will have to trouble you."
　　In these ten days, 39 farmers have been taken care of, and more than 20 carts have been loaded with more than 37,000 jin of coal. The price is one yuan cheaper per jin than in the market, which saves these farmers more than 37,000 yuan on coal alone. It also sold five carts of cotton transported by seven farmers from Yangjia Village, Chenwei Village, and Bocun Village in Shulu County. Pan Lao Zhong and his party of four from Side Village, District 3, Zhao County, transported sweet potatoes, and Wang Lao Kang and his partner from Xinxin Village, Anyang, transported salt, etc. They all transported the goods to the market first, and only came to the service center after they could not sell them all. The service center quickly sold them at the market price, and also bought them utensils and consumer goods. Finally, they loaded coal at the service center and went back. From their actual work, they solved all the difficulties for these farmers entering the city. Before leaving, they were all satisfied and unanimously praised the Farmers' Service Center for truly doing things for the farmers. The comrades working at the center said: "Being responsible, keeping promises, and considering more for the farmers are prerequisites for the progress of this work." In order to expand work and strengthen the exchange of materials between urban and rural areas, the center has recently intensified its contact with state-owned, public-owned, and various production and commercial institutions to further meet the supply and sales demands of the majority of farmers.
　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　
　　Editor's Note: The Shijiazhuang City Farmers' Service Center has won the support of farmers in its first ten days of enthusiastic and active work, which proves that the establishment of farmers' service centers in cities meets the needs of the majority of farmers. However, since the center is newly established, it must have many difficulties and methods and experiences to overcome them in the process of exploration. We hope to summarize them in a timely manner and report them continuously to serve as a reference for other cities.

　　石市农民服务所积极工作
  　农民入城感到方便
    【本报讯】石家庄合作总社为了解决农民来城市购买物品和销售生产物的困难，特地在桥东犬兴街举办农民服务所，成立十天来，因热诚为农民服务，沟通了城乡之间的关系，受到广大农民的赞成和拥护。该所曾到附近各县村庄进行宣传，在十一个村建立了初步联系，已有农民开始来市找服务所为他们办事。乐城寺上村介绍来的陈老有买西药，服务所为他照办了，这位老乡还附带买些麸子，他自己在市上打听的最低价钱是四十三元新币一斤，回来交给服务所办，服务所在公营裕民公司只以三十元一斤代他收下来，他临走时感激的说：“你们真是为咱农民办事的，以后我拿麦子来换，还要麻烦你们。”
    在这十天中已有三十九个农民受到照顾，二十多辆大车装去三万七千多斤煤炭，价钱上每斤比市上便宜新币一元，使这些农民仅在煤炭上就节省了三万七千多元。并且还代销了束鹿杨家庄、陈位村、泊村等村七个农民运的五车棉花。赵县三区四德村潘老忠一行四人运的红薯，安阳徐新村王老康二人运的食盐等。他们都是先运到市上卖不完了才到服务所的。服务所都照着市价很快的代他们推销了，又代他们买了用具和消费物品，最后在该所装运煤炭回去，从实际工作中为这些农民们解决了进城的一切困难，临走时都心满意足的一致夸耀农民服务所是真正为农民办事的。该所的工作同志说：“负责任、守信用、多为农民打算是这一工作进展中的先决条件。”该所为展开工作加强城乡物资交流，近日更为加紧与国营、公营和各方面的生产与商业机构的联系，进一步迎接广大农民的供销要求。
    　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　
    编者按：石市农民服务所，初办十天来，已经在热诚积极工作中，博得了农民的拥护，足证在城市中设立农民服务所是符合于广大农民所需要的。但，该所系属初办，在摸索过程中，一定有许多困难以及克服困难的办法与经验，望及时总结，连续报导，以为其他城市作借镜。
