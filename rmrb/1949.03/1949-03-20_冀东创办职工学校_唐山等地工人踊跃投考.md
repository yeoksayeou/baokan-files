　　Jidong Establishes Workers' School
  　Workers in Tangshan and Other Places Enthusiatically Apply
    [Jidong Electric] After more than a month of preparation, the Jidong Workers' School opened on March 10th. The principal is Liu Shenzhi, Minister of Civil Affairs of the Jidong District Party Committee. The first class enrolled 1,000 people from industrial sectors such as mines and factories in Tangshan, Qinhuangdao, and other places. The study period is three months, and the aim is to train worker cadres and economic construction personnel. After graduation, the school can be responsible for introducing work opportunities, or returning to their original positions, based on the principle of voluntarism. Food, accommodation, and books are provided by the school during the study period. The Workers' School is the first of its kind to be established in the Jidong area. Since the recruitment advertisement was published, workers from factories and mines throughout the region have enthusiastically signed up and applied for the exam, greatly encouraging the workers' enthusiasm for learning. The female workers of the night school of the Tangshan New Yarn Factory repeatedly inquired about the application conditions from the workers' preparatory committee of the mine; the workers of the patrol team of the Tangshan Mine of the Kailuan Coal Mine paid attention to the date of the examination every day.
