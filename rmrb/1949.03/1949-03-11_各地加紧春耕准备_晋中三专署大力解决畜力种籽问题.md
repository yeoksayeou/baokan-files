	[Yuci Dispatch] Due to the severe shortage of livestock and seeds faced by farmers in Jinzhong as a result of Yan bandit's "soldier-peasant integration" tyranny, the People's Government is vigorously solving this problem. The Tongtai Store, opened by the Jinzhong Third Special Commissioner's Office in Yuci, has formulated specific measures. It has been decided to export cloth in exchange for livestock or to purchase 1,300 head of livestock. This plan will be fully completed by mid-April of the lunar calendar. It has also been decided to supply farmers with 840 *shi* of grain seeds, and special crop seeds: including 480,000 *jin* of cotton seeds, 8,100 *jin* of peanuts, 30 *shi* of alfalfa, and 500 *jin* of broad beans. In addition, in order to eliminate insect pests, 200 *jin* of red alum will be supplied. Cadres have already been dispatched to Suiyuan, Shaanxi, Taihang, Taiyue and other regions to purchase these.
