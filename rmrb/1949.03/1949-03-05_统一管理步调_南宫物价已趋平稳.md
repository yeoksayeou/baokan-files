　　Unified Management Steps
  　Nangong Commodity Prices Tend to Stabilize
    [Jinan Telegram] State-owned economic departments in Nangong have strengthened market management, worked closely with cooperatives, and struggled against speculative private merchants, resulting in stable commodity prices. When prices fluctuated and the market was chaotic, state-owned economic departments such as Ruifeng Goods Station, Yiyuan Store, and Dasheng Store, as well as state-owned economic departments in neighboring areas, assisted by selling large quantities of food at prices lower than the market price, according to the trade regulations. They also closely cooperated with cooperatives. For example, during the Spring Festival, Ruifeng Goods Station allocated tens of thousands of catties of wheat, which were resold to poor citizens through the city cooperative, allowing them to eat dumplings. The financial committee composed of various public enterprises unified steps and management, and systematically fought against private merchants who engaged in speculation and hoarding. The bank stopped commercial loans and collected debts, reducing market chips and preventing some private merchants from rushing to purchase goods. Public stores stopped hoarding and sold food to the outside. The Industry and Commerce Bureau, in coordination with cadres from various departments, conducted in-depth inspections in various districts to strengthen administrative management. A price management committee was formed by the bank, the Industry and Commerce Section, the Trade Company, the Jianhua Company, the Dasheng Store, the municipal government, and the county Production Promotion Society to study prices, control the market, and stabilize market prices. As a result, the two price fluctuations were not prolonged and tended to stabilize.

　　统一管理步调
  　南宫物价已趋平稳
    【冀南电】南宫国营经济部门加强市场管理，与合作社密切配合，对投机倒把私商作斗争，物价得到平稳。当物价波动、市场混乱时，国营经济部门瑞丰货栈、一元商店、大生商店等及友邻区国营经济部门协助，以大批食粮，按贸总规定价格低于市价抛售，并与合作社密切结合。如过年时，瑞丰货栈拨麦数万斤，通过市合作社转卖给贫苦市民，使贫苦市民吃到饺子。各公营企业组成的财委会，统一步调，统一管理，有计划有步骤地与投机取巧囤积居奇的私商进行斗争，银行停止商业贷款，进行收款，缩小市场筹码，制止部分私商的抢购活动。各公营商店停止吸收，向外抛售食粮。工商局配合各部门干部，深入各区检查，加强行政管理。并以银行、工商科、贸易公司、建华公司、大生商店、市政府、县生产推进社，组成物价管理委员会，研究物价、掌握市场、稳定市场物价等工作，这样以来使两次物价波动时间未得延长，而趋于平稳。
