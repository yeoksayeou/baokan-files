Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, March 25th: The protest movement against the North Atlantic Treaty is rapidly expanding throughout the world. News of strikes and demonstrations by the Italian people protesting against the North Atlantic Treaty continues to pour in from all over the country: Several thousand people held a mass rally in Bergamo, and workers in Riedi held a general strike in protest. In the provinces of Bologna and Areglia, a movement of demonstrations and strikes by workers and staff to protest the Gasperi government's war policy has been widely launched. The Italy-Soviet Friendship Association issued a statement protesting the North Atlantic Treaty, stating: The Italy-Soviet Friendship Association believes that the proposal to make Italy participate in the Atlantic Treaty is a dangerous act that undermines European peace and puts our country at risk of being involved in war in accordance with the interests of foreign imperialism. The association calls on all branches and the entire Italian people to take action to stop the shameful reactionary propaganda, which some people are trying to use to psychologically create an atmosphere of violent aggression.

The Norwegian Communist Party issued a declaration calling on the people of the whole country to safeguard peace and protest against Norway's participation in the North Atlantic Treaty. The declaration pointed out: "The Marshall Plan has made Norway politically and economically a dependency of American imperialism. Norway's participation in the North Atlantic Treaty will mean handing over our country to the Western countries." In Stavanger, the Norwegian people held a mass rally and passed a resolution to send to the government protesting against participation in the North Atlantic Treaty. The resolution also stated: American imperialism is planning to turn Norway into a bridgehead for anti-Soviet activities. We firmly oppose the government's war policy. Norway must stand in the ranks of countries fighting for peace and disarmament. We want food, not cannons; we want housing, not bullets. We want peace, not war!

In Denmark, when Foreign Minister Rasmussen made a speech to the Parliament on Denmark's participation in the North Atlantic Treaty, a demonstration broke out in the Parliament's gallery. The demonstrators' placards read: "We don't want to die for Wall Street," "The youth say: Down with the North Atlantic Treaty," and the demonstrators shouted, "We protest against the government's war policy," "We don't want to turn Denmark into a battlefield." In Austria, according to the Communist Party newspaper "People's Opinion," workers will hold a demonstration in Vienna on the 27th to protest against the North Atlantic Treaty.

British Communist Party General Secretary Pollitt expressed his belief in the weekly "World News and Views" that "British workers will neither work nor fight in a war against their Soviet comrades." He pointed out: "The main danger of war comes from the Anglo-American bloc and its war policies, and the American imperialists intend to make Britain their main war base in the event of a war - which is extremely unlikely, because the forces of peace are greater than the forces of warmongers."

The Dutch Communist Party newspaper "De Waarheid" also published an editorial pointing out that the American and British aggressors cannot deal with unemployment and crisis. They and their accomplices know that they are facing the edge of the abyss and want to prolong their existence by creating a new war, but the working people of France, Italy and Britain have long said to the warmongers: "We object," and the Dutch working class must also say: "We object."

The Chicago Sun-Times pointed out that the Atlantic Treaty is a treaty of generals, it prepares for war rather than peace, and the United States has abandoned the United Nations' principle of advocating peaceful settlement of international disputes and replaced it with seeking alliances to divide the United Nations.

　　“我们不愿为华尔街送死！”
    意挪英美等国人民抗议“北大西洋公约”
    【新华社北平二十五日电】全世界各国人民对北大西洋公约的抗议运动正在迅速扩大。意大利人民抗议北大西洋公约的罢工与示威消息继续从全国各地传来：贝尔加摩举行了几千人的群众大会，里底的工人举行了抗议总罢工。布洛格那省与阿盖里亚省的职工用示威罢工以抗议加斯贝利政府战争政策的运动普遍展开。意苏友好协会发表抗议北大西洋公约声明称：意苏友好协会认为使意大利参加大西洋公约的建议，有按照外国帝国主义的利益而破坏欧洲和平，并使我国被卷入战争的危险的行动。该会号召一切分会与全意大利人民采取行动阻止可耻的反动宣传，这种宣传正是有人企图用来在心理上造成暴力侵略空气的。
    挪威共产党发表了宣言，号召全国人民维护和平与抗议挪威参加北大西洋公约。宣言指出：“马歇尔计划已使挪威在政治上与经济上沦为美帝国主义的附庸。挪威之参加北大西洋公约将意味着把我国断送在西方国家手中”。在斯达完格，挪威人民举行群众大会，通过向政府致送抗议参加北大西洋公约的决议。决议并称：美帝国主义正拟变挪威为反苏的桥头阵地，我们坚决反对政府的战争政策。挪威必须置身于为和平与裁军而斗争的国家的行列。我们要粮食，不要大炮，要住房，不要子弹。我们要和平，不要战争！
    在丹麦，当外长拉斯墨森向国会作关于丹麦参加北大西洋公约的演说时，国会旁听席上发生了示威，示威者的标语牌上写着：“我们不愿为华尔街而死”，“青年们说：打倒北大西洋公约”，示威者高呼，“我们抗议政府战争政策”，“我们不愿把丹麦变成战场”。在奥地利，据共产党机关报“人民舆论”披露，工人们将于二十七日在维也纳举行示威，抗议北大西洋公约。
    英国共产党总书记波立特在“世界新闻与评论”周刊上撰文表示了这样的信念，坚信“英国的工人在反对他们苏联同志的战争中将既不工作也不打仗”。他指出：“战争的主要危险来自英美集团及其战争政策，而且美帝国主义者意愿在一旦发生战争——这是极不可能的，因为和平的力量大于战争贩子的力量——之时，使英国成为他们主要的战争基地”。
    荷兰共产党机关报“德瓦海德”报亦发表社论指出：美英侵略者无法对付失业与危机。他们与他们的同谋者知道他们已面临深渊的边缘，想以制造新战争来苟延他们的生存，但是法国、意大利和英国的劳动人民早就向战争贩子们说过：“我们反对”，荷兰工人阶级同样要说：“我们反对”。
    美国芝加哥太阳时报指出大西洋公约是将军们的条约，他准备战争而不是和平，美国已背弃了联合国主张和平解决国际分歧的原则而代之以寻求同盟来分裂联合国。
