Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, 16th—In the past month and a half, Tianjin Daily and the Tianjin Branch of Xinhua News Agency have actively promoted worker correspondence, achieving considerable results. As of the end of last month, 536 worker correspondents and 141 staff correspondents, totaling 677, have been developed in various enterprise departments in Tianjin. In February alone, 443 contributions were received from worker correspondents, with 96 published, accounting for more than 21% of the total submissions. The submissions from worker correspondents are generally well-written. Tianjin Daily publishes worker contributions in prominent positions, earning praise from readers. Workers are very happy to see their own writings published in the newspaper. A worker from the Tianjin East Railway Station locomotive section, upon seeing an article about workers in their section contributing materials published in the newspaper, said with pleasure: "Being valued by us workers like this, we must step up production." Tianjin Daily received strong assistance from the Tianjin Office of the North China Federation of Trade Unions and other departments in developing worker correspondents. The working groups there organized correspondence groups and, while working in factories, wrote articles themselves and helped develop worker correspondents. Many factories combined the development and training of correspondents with the wall newspaper study groups. Some organized correspondence groups before starting wall newspapers, with wall newspaper editors often emerging from the correspondence groups; others started wall newspapers first and then organized correspondence groups, sending good articles from the wall newspapers to Tianjin Daily. In this way, Tianjin Daily connected with factory worker wall newspapers and had a broad base of worker support. In most factories, worker correspondence groups are organized according to different production units, with worker correspondents and trade union working group correspondents mixed together. Workers with subject matter but unable to write can ask trade union cadres and staff to write on their behalf, learning and helping each other. (Image attached)

　　天津日报联系广大工人
  　开展职工通讯运动
    二月份收到职工作品四百余件
    【新华社天津十六日电】天津日报和新华社天津分社，在最近一个半月来积极开展职工通讯工作，收到相当成效。截至上月底止，已发展天津各企业部门的工人通讯员五百三十六名，职员通讯员一百四十一名，共六百七十七名。在二月份内，共收到职工通讯员来稿四百四十三件，已发表者九十六件，占来稿总数百分之二十一以上。职工通讯员的稿件，一般都写得很好。天津日报时以显著地位发表工人的作品，并博得读者好评。工人们看到报纸上发表了他们自己写的稿子，十分高兴。天津东车站机务段一个工人见到他们段里工人献交器材的事登了报，高兴地说：“这样看得起我们工人，我们更要加紧生产。”天津日报在发展职工通讯员中，得到了华北总工会天津办事处等部门的有力的帮助。该处的各工作小组组织了通讯小组，在工厂工作时，一面自己写稿，一面帮助发展职工通讯员。很多工厂在发展和培养通讯员中，与壁报的学习组结合，有的是先组织通讯组后办壁报，壁报编辑多从通讯组中产生；有的是先办壁报后组织通讯组，把壁报上好的稿件送往天津日报。这样，就使天津日报与工厂的工人壁报衔接，而有了广大的工人群众基础。职工通讯组在大多数工厂是按不同的生产单位编组，职工中的通讯员和工会工作组中的通讯员混合编在一起，工人有题材者不能写的，可以请工会干部和职员代笔，互相学习和帮助。（附图片）
