　　Recommendation for "Model Teacher for All Ages"
　　Lí Xiānyào

　　"Model Teacher for All Ages" is a new Soviet film, originally titled "The Village Teacher." Now that the ancient cultural city of Beiping has returned to the embrace of its people, and the question of how intellectuals should integrate with workers and peasants has become a major topic in our revolution, this film has very practical educational significance for intellectuals.

　　This film tells the story of a female student from a normal school, from her graduation at the age of eighteen until her hair turns gray, always persisting in serving the people through education. This female student, named Varvara, is an ordinary and simple person. She is determined to go to a remote village in the motherland to be a teacher. Holding a globe, she arrives in a dilapidated horse-drawn carriage at a desolate and poor farm under the rule of the Tsar. For decades, day after day, she overcomes difficulties and obstacles, determined to save the people living like beasts of burden from ignorance, disease, and poverty, just as her lover, Martynov, entrusted his hope to her on the eve of his arrest, bathing in the moonlight of the Volga River:

　　"May the Siberian storms not blow away your ideals!"

　　Working silently like an earthworm, she is like the sun, never taking a day off. She takes children to the wilderness, telling them how wheat in the fields becomes bread, and why the rainbow is so beautiful. Under her patient guidance, her students not only understand that the earth is rotating, but they can also recite the poems of Nekrasov!

　　"Poverty is not a sin, but a glorious path walked by many!"

　　Initially, she went to the countryside vaguely and unconsciously, with the ascetic ideas of the old Russian "Populists" and the petty-bourgeoisie's sentimental humanitarianism. She stood up to protect wives from being beaten by their husbands, and she saved dozens of rubles of her monthly salary to help poor farmers whose children and livestock were crushed to death by dilapidated houses. But as long as the Tsar was still enthroned, all her efforts at reform were in vain; her good students were also barred from the gates of middle school because they were the sons of peasants. The village remained a hell for the farmers.

　　The victory of the October Revolution brought a new world to Russia. Her poor students with mud on their hands could put on neat uniforms and stride into the gates of urban middle schools; the countryside where she taught resounded with the joyful songs of collective farms and the chorus of tractors. Her small wooden classroom, which could not withstand the wind and rain, had also been transformed into a concrete building filled with sunlight. Real life deeply educated her, making her understand that this happy world was bought with the blood and lives of countless heroic and selfless Communist Party members, like her Martynov.

　　After years of hard work and training, like a cold-resistant pine, she can withstand any cruel blow. The sacrifice of her lover did not discourage her or make her slacken in her efforts in her work. She suppressed the pain of her personal emotions and devoted her ordinary but great life to the cause of people's education!

　　One day, in the fatigue after a full day of work, she heard on the radio that the motherland had awarded her the most glorious medal in gratitude for her life's work in serving the people through education. She was so moved that tears rolled down her cheeks, tears that were the most sacred and sweetest of humanity. At the victory celebration of the anti-fascist war, the labor heroes returning from the Ural factories in the rear, the heroic nurses returning from the front-line hospitals, the soldiers triumphantly returning from Berlin and Warsaw, were all children whom she had taught to grow up from 'person,' 'hand,' 'knife,' and 'ruler,' all children whose noses she had wiped, whom she had scolded for being naughty, and whom she had praised for being clever. Today, her motherland's fields are filled with peach and plum blossoms, all seeds that she had sown in the snowy weather. How could she not embrace them and smile through her tears?

　　We should learn from Varvara. Her life points out a bright future for us Chinese intellectuals!

　　推荐“万世师表”

    “万世师表”是一张苏联新片，原名叫“乡村女教师”。当今天北平这文化古城已回到人民自己的怀里，知识分子如何和工农结合，已成为目前我们革命中一个主要课题的时候，这张影片对知识分子，是有极现实的教育意义的。
    这张影片是写一个师范学校的女学生，从她十八岁由学校毕业，一直到鬓发尽白，始终坚持着为人民教育服务的故事。这位女学生名字叫华尔华娜，是一个平凡又朴实的人，她立志要到祖国边远的乡村去当一个教师。她抱着地球仪，乘一辆破马车来到尚在沙皇统治下的荒凉、贫穷的农庄来，几十年如一日，不避艰难和阻挠，要把那里度着牛马生活的人民从愚昧、疾病、穷困中拯救出来，真如她爱人马尔丁诺夫，在被捕的前夜，浴着伏尔加河的月色，对她所寄托的希望：
    “但愿西伯里亚的暴风，不会吹拆了你的理想！”
    象蚯蚓一样，默默地工作着，她象太阳一样永无请假的日子。她将孩子带着到旷野去，告诉他们田里的麦子怎样变成面包，虹又为什么这样美丽。在她循循诱导之下，她的学生们不但明白了地球是转动的，并且他们还会背诵尼克拉索夫的诗篇！
    “贫穷并不是罪恶，而是很多人走过的光荣的道路！”
    最初，她是朦胧不自觉地，带着当时旧俄“民粹派”的苦行思想，小资产阶级温情的人道主义下乡去的。她曾挺身而出卫护受丈夫敲打的妻子，她节省下一月几十卢布的薪金，来帮助被破屋压死了孩子和牲畜的贫农。但是只要沙皇还高踞在宝座上，她这一切改良的努力，全都落了空；她的好学生，也因为是农民儿子的身世，被摈弃在中学的大门外。村庄依然是农民们的地狱。
    十月革命的胜利，替俄罗斯带来了一个新世界，她底手沾泥粪的穷学生可以穿起整洁的制服，昂首跨进城市中学的门槛了；她所教书的农村，响起了集体农庄快乐的歌声和曳引机的合唱，她那一间挡不住风雨的矮木屋教室，也已变成了一座充满了阳光的水门汀大楼。现实生活深深地教育了她，使她懂得了这幸福的世界，是无数和她底马尔丁诺夫一样的，英勇忘我的共产党员的鲜血和生命所换来的。
    经过多年艰苦岁月的磨炼，象一株耐寒的松柏，她已能经受任何残酷的打击，她爱人的牺牲，并没有使她灰心，使她懈怠于对自己工作的努力，她按住自己个人感情的伤痛，在人民教育事业上，寄托自己平凡而又伟大的一生！
    一天，她在整日工作后的疲劳中，听到播音机中报告，祖国颁给她最光荣的奖章，以答谢她一生为人民教育服务的功绩时，她太感动了，感动得滚出了泪，这也是人类最圣洁，最甜蜜的泪。当反法西斯卫国战争胜利的庆祝会上，从后方乌拉尔工厂回来的劳动英雄们，从前方医院回来的英勇的看护们，从柏林、华沙战胜荣归的战士们，都是她从人、手、刀、尺起教他们长大的孩子，都是她曾替他们擦过鼻涕、骂过他们顽皮也赞过他们聪明的孩子。今天她祖国原野上一片桃李，都是她在风雪天播下的种子，她怎能不拥抱着他们含泪而笑呢？
    我们应该向华尔华娜学习，她的一生，正指出了我们中国知识分子一条光明的前途！
