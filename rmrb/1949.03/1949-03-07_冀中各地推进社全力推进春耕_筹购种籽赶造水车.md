　　冀中各地推进社全力推进春耕
    筹购种籽赶造水车
    【冀中电】冀中各县生产推进社为了便利群众春耕生产，正积极的制造农具准备大批籽种肥料。交河、安国两县推进社从一月份就开始制犁、耙、耙齿等各种农具。赵县推进社从去年冬天就替群众准备棉花籽种，在一月底已准备好十五万多斤。为了增加水井提高产量，赵县水车制造厂正积极制造与帮助群众修理水车，并从赞皇买来大批水车原料。藁城县社最近共收买骨头九万斤，现已制造骨肥四万五千斤，准备在春季播种卖给群众。文新水乡村大麦种很缺，该村推进社为了解决群众困难，就收购群众稻米，到雄县地区换回大麦种，只第一次就收买稻米七万斤，换回大麦种籽七千余斤。深泽、晋县等推进社则用黑豆扶助油房活动，榨油后收豆饼，一方面扶助了油业发展；同时也准备了肥料。一套本钱起两套作用，群众和油房都很称赞。据晋、深、赵、藁等七县统计：共准备肥料八十二万三千九百九十斤，各种籽种二十二万三千四百三十一斤。
