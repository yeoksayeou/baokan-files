　　Tangshan Qianheyi Trading Company, entrusted by the former Tianjin Zhongfang Company's Tangshan Cotton Purchasing Office to purchase cotton, supervisor Zheng Jiequan and manager Wang Wenxin colluded to misappropriate state property. After the discovery, they were punished accordingly. Tangshan was liberated on December 12th of last year. Zheng Jiequan and Wang Wenxin learned that the Tangshan Cotton Purchasing Office of Zhongfang had suffered losses in its accounts and thought there was an opportunity to take advantage of it. They forged accounts and embezzled 9,684 catties of cotton waste. When our People's Government sent personnel to take over the office, we immediately discovered this. After repeated guidance by the government, Wang Wenxin finally confessed the process of embezzling the cotton waste on February 24th. However, Zheng Jiequan not only repeatedly prevented Wang from confessing beforehand, but even after the truth was clear, he still tried to deny it. The People's Government handed Zheng Jiequan and others over to the People's Court for handling. Zheng Jiequan has now been sentenced to two years of imprisonment and fined 16,000 yuan in Renminbi according to law. Wang Wenxin originally colluded in the scheme, but was ultimately able to proactively confess his criminal acts. The People's Government has therefore granted him leniency, ordering him to hand over all the cotton waste he embezzled and releasing him after education.

　　唐山谦和益监理郑介泉
    侵占国家财产
  　政府依法惩处
    【唐山电】前伪天津中纺公司唐山收花处委托收购棉花之谦和益商号，监理郑介泉、经理王文新合谋侵占国家财产，经发觉后，分别予以惩处。唐山于去年十二月十二日解放，郑介泉、王文新得知中纺唐山收花处帐目损失，认为有机可乘，乃伪造帐目，从中贪污穰花九千六百八十四斤。当我人民政府派员接收该处时，当即为我发觉，经政府屡次开导，直至二月二十四日王文新才说出侵占穰花经过。但郑介泉不仅事先多次阻王坦白，及至事实真象已明，犹图抵赖，人民政府当将郑介泉等交人民法院处理。现已依法判处郑介泉有期徒刑二年，罚金人民币一万六千元。王文新本与合谋，但最后仍能主动说出犯罪事实，人民政府特予以宽大，除责其将其侵占之穰花全部呈缴外，给以教育后释放。
