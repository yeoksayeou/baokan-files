　　Jibei Electric Power Company
    Replacing Utility Poles
    [Ping Municipal News] Jibei Electric Power Company's Beijing branch has over 35,000 wooden utility poles within its business area. According to regulations, a wooden utility pole can only be used for a maximum of ten years, requiring over 3,000 poles to be replaced annually. In the past, due to the corruption and exploitation of the reactionary government, replacements were never properly carried out, resulting in frequently encountering rotten poles on the verge of collapse both inside and outside Beijing. After liberation, the enthusiasm of "Jidian" staff has increased. They are prepared to save on other unnecessary expenses and replace 300 poles per month according to regulations. They have already purchased 350 concrete poles with 3-fen reinforcing steel bars from the Pingjin Railway Administration and will soon start replacing the poles.
    [Another News Item] The Pingjin transmission line from Tianjin to Beicang was completely destroyed by the former Kuomintang army. In order to quickly transmit the surplus electricity from Tangshan to Beijing, allowing the Shijingshan Power Plant to have the opportunity to shut down a blast furnace earlier for scheduled maintenance and prevent power outages, urgent repairs are currently underway. The 120 concrete poles with 5-fen iron reinforcing steel bars required will cost approximately 5 million yuan. Fundraising and ordering are proceeding simultaneously.

　　冀北电力公司
    抽换电杆
    【平市讯】冀北电力公司北平分公司营业区域以内的木头电杆，一共有三万五千多根，照规矩一根木头电杆顶多只能用十年，每年要抽换三千多根。过去因为反动政府的贪污剥削，一直没有能好好的换，所以北平城里城外常常发现摇摇欲倒的腐烂杆子。解放以后，“冀电”工作人员情绪提高，都准备节省其他不必要开支，每月按规矩抽换三百根。现已向平津区铁路管理局买妥三百五十根三分钢筋的洋灰杆，不久就要动工换杆。
    【又讯】平津输电线路从天津到北仓的一段，完全被原国民党军破坏。为了赶快把唐山的余电送到北平，让石景山发电所可以有机会早些停下一座高压炉，作定期检修，不致停电起见，现正积极抢修。要用的一百二十根五分铁筋的洋灰杆，约需五百万元，已经一面筹款，一面订购。
