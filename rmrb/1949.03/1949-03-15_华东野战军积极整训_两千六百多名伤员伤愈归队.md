Xinhua News Agency, East China, 14th -- The East China Field Army is conducting large-scale reorganization and training between the Huai and Yangtze Rivers. At the beginning of the reorganization, each unit held celebratory meetings to commend their achievements. At the meetings, many heroic models expressed their determination to take the lead in completing the reorganization tasks, just as they had done in battle. They also established plans for completing the reorganization tasks. During the reorganization, commanders and fighters first studied Chairman Mao's statement on the current situation on January 14th, recognizing the situation of the Chinese revolution. Through studying the current situation, all commanders and fighters have gained a further understanding of the importance of this reorganization. As Liu Chuansheng, a machine gun platoon leader of a certain unit, said, "In the future, we must work harder to improve our professional skills and command abilities, otherwise we will fall behind the situation and will not be able to complete the task of liberating all of China." New soldiers who were liberated and joined the People's Liberation Army during the Huaihai Campaign have gradually improved their class consciousness after undergoing education on past grievances. Currently, all units have plunged into a training upsurge. Many soldiers insist on training despite illness. Shao Shuchun, a soldier of a certain unit, hurt his shoulder while throwing grenades, but still practiced hard, increasing his throwing distance from 30 meters to more than 40 meters in two days. In a certain division, everyone from the division commander to the animal keepers participated in military subject learning.
Xinhua News Agency, East China, 14th -- More than 2,600 wounded soldiers from a certain unit of the East China People's Liberation Army, who were gloriously wounded in the Huaihai Campaign, have now recovered and returned to their units. During their recuperation in rear hospitals, most comrades consciously abided by discipline and helped the hospital with its work. Many comrades were commended for their meritorious service. When they heard that the front-line troops were actively undergoing reorganization and training in preparation for liberating all of China, they requested to be discharged from the hospital and return to their units.

　　华东野战军积极整训
    两千六百多名伤员伤愈归队
    【新华社华东十四日电】华东野战军正在江淮之间进行大规模的整训。整训开始时，各部均举行了庆功祝捷大会。会上，许多英雄模范们纷纷表示，要象在战斗中一样，带头完成整训任务。他们并订立了完成整训任务的计划。在整训中，指战员们首先学习了一月十四日毛主席关于时局的声明，认清了中国革命的形势。经过时事学习，全体指战员对于这次整训的重要性。有了进一步的认识，如某部机枪连排长刘传生说：“今后必须更加努力，提高自己的业务和指挥能力，否则就会落在形势后面，不能很好地完成解放全中国的任务。”在淮海战役中才被解放过来参加解放军的新战士，在经过了诉苦教育以后，阶级觉悟逐渐提高。现各部均投入了练兵的热潮，许多战士抱病坚持练兵，某部战士邵树春打手榴弹，摔痛了肩膊仍然苦练，两天内从三十米投至四十多米。某师从师长到饲养员都一律参加军事课目的学习。
    【新华社华东十四日电】华东解放军某部在淮海战役中光荣负伤的两千六百余名伤员，现已伤愈返回部队。他们在后方医院疗养时，大多数同志均能自觉地遵守纪律，并帮助院方进行工作。许多同志立了功。他们在医院听到前方部队现正积极进行整训，准备解放全中国时，纷纷要求出院归队。
