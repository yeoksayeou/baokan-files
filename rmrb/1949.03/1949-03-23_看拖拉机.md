　　Watching the Tractor
　　Wei Jin

　　On March 17th, ten tractors appeared at the Nanyuan Farm south of Beiping City. When these ten tractors traveled at a speed of 36 li per hour for nearly ten hours to reach Nanyuan Farm, the newly liberated farmers from Dahongmen, Liuhezhuang, Wudian Village and other places near the farm were in an uproar. "Let's go see the tractors!" The farmers cheered and flocked to the farm to see the tractors.

　　The tractors are American-made. The body is painted with brand-new vermilion, has 25 horsepower, can plow five or six mu per hour, up to more than seven inches deep, and can harrow 20 mu per hour (when there are many clods, it can harrow 15 mu). When the tractor started with a鸣鸣sound, the farmers all applauded and cheered.

　　Many people chased after the tractor like children chase after a car, tireless. Some people grabbed a handful of soil from the deeply and widely plowed field and shouted, "Look, how can livestock turn up such good soil?" An old farmer touched the smooth body of the machine, then touched his beard, and suddenly smiled kindly: "This has become our thing too!"

　　In order to make the tractor tillage more effective, the farmers rushed to tell the people who managed the farm which land was suitable for planting cotton, which land was suitable for planting wheat, and which land should not be plowed too deep... They talked endlessly, reluctant to leave.

　　They asked to jointly operate the farm with the public. When they received a satisfactory answer, they all shouted happily: "In the past, the officials ran it, and we didn't dare to enter the farm. Now we can also use tractors to cultivate the land!"

　　看拖拉机
    维进
    三月十七日，北平城南的南苑农场出现十架拖拉机，当这十架拖拉机以每小时三十六华里的速度走了将近十小时到达南苑农场时，农场附近大洪门、六合庄、庑甸村等地的新解放农民为之轰动。“看拖拉机呀！”农民们都欢天喜地的嚷着，成群结队的到农场来看拖拉机。
    拖拉机是美式的。机身漆着簇新的朱红色，有二十五个马力，每小时能耕五、六亩，深达七英寸多，每小时能耙二十亩（土块多的时候，可耙十五亩）。当拖拉机鸣鸣地开动的时候，农民都一齐鼓掌、欢呼。
    许多人象小孩追汽车似的，不知疲倦，一直追着拖拉机跑。有的人从犁得又深又宽的地里，抓起一把土嚷着：“瞧呀，牲口那里能翻起这些好土来呢？”一个老农民摸着光滑的机身，又摸摸自己的胡子，忽然亲切地笑了：“这也成了咱们的东西啦！”
    农民为使拖拉机耕地更有成效，争着告诉管理农场的人，那块地适合种棉花，那块地适合种麦子，那些地不应犁得太深……。他们絮絮不完地谈着，依依不舍的不愿离开。
    他们纷纷要求和公家合伙经营农场。当他们得到满意答复的时候，都高兴的嚷着：“从前人家官办，咱们不敢进农场一步，现在咱也能够用拖拉机耕地了！”
