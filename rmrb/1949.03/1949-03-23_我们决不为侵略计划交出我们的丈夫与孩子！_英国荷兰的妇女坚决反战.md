　　“We Will Never Surrender Our Husbands and Children for Aggression Plans!”
     British and Dutch Women Firmly Oppose War
    In Britain, in the Stepney district of London, which was bombed by fascists during World War II, mothers are passing around notebooks, writing letters demanding peace. They plan to send a representative with these letters to attend the World Congress of Advocates for Peace. One notebook reads: "The women of Stepney, who sacrificed their sons in the last war, whose homes have been destroyed and families broken, cannot now stand idly by and allow those who profit from war to realize their plans to launch another world war."
    On the 17th, the Dutch Women's Federation held a mass women's rally in The Hague, enthusiastically supporting the convening of the World Congress of Advocates for Peace. The conference unanimously passed a resolution stating: "Dutch women resolutely oppose the aggressive plans of the US-British bloc and solemnly declare: We will never surrender our husbands and children for such plans. We demand that the government oppose war preparations and instruct its representatives attending the United Nations to support the Soviet Union's proposals for disarmament and the prohibition of atomic weapons." The conference also demanded an end to the colonial war in Indonesia and freedom for the Indonesian people. This resolution has been sent to the United Nations and the government.

　　“我们决不为侵略计划交出我们的丈夫与孩子！”
     英国荷兰的妇女坚决反战
    在英国，在第二次世界大战中曾遭法西斯滥炸过的伦敦斯迭普尼区，母亲们之间正传递着练习簿，在上面书写要求和平的书信。她们计划派一个代表带着这些信去出席世界拥护和平大会。有一本练习簿上写道：“斯迭普尼的妇女，在上次战争中已经牺牲了她们的儿子，她们的家宅已经被毁，家庭已经破碎。现在，她们决不能袖手旁观，听任那些从战争中得利的人们实现他们发动另一次世界战争的计划。”
    荷兰妇女联合会十七日在海牙举行妇女群众大会，热烈地支持召开世界拥护和平大会。大会一致通过决议称：“荷兰妇女坚决反对美英集团的侵略计划，并庄严宣告：我们决不为这种计划交出我们的丈夫和子弟。我们要求政府反对战争准备，并训令其出席联合国的代表支持苏联所提出的裁军和禁止原子武器的建议。”大会并要求停止在印尼的殖民战争，予印尼人民以自由。这一决议已送交联合国和政府。
