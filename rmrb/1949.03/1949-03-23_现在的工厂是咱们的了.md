　　The Factories Now Belong to Us
    [Ping City News] Liu Qingzu, a worker at the 71st Arsenal, is responsible for pressing wooden handles, a dangerous job. During the Kuomintang rule, he was suppressed and exploited in every way, daring to be angry but not daring to speak out. Therefore, regardless of whether the shell casings and wooden handles fit, he would just grab them and press them forcefully. As a result, the daily waste products amounted to 8 or 9 percent. Since liberation, he has been conscientious in his work. He tries his best to do everything well, so the proportion of waste products has quickly decreased to 1 or 2 percent. When asked "why," he said, "The factories now belong to us, not the bureaucrats."

　　现在的工厂是咱们的了
    【平市讯】七十一兵工厂工友刘庆祖，每天工作是木柄装压，这种工作很危险。在国民党统治时期，他因为各方面受压迫，受剥削，敢怒不敢言，所以不管弹壳和木柄合适与否，拿起来就猛力一压。这样，每天的废品都得有百分之八、九。解放以来，他对工作就认真了。什么也是尽量往好做，所以废品的比例很快减少到百分之一、二。大家问他“为什么”，他说：“现在的工厂是咱们的了，不是官僚的了。”
