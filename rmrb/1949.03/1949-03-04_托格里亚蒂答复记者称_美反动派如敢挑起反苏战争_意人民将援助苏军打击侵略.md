Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 2nd. TASS, Rome: Togliatti, General Secretary of the Italian Communist Party's answers to two questions raised by a reporter from the "News Evening Post" were published in the paper on February 26th. The questions and answers are as follows:

First question: The statement made by the leader of the French Communist Party, Thorez, regarding the stance that the French working masses and the French people would take if the Soviet army were forced to pursue aggressors to Paris, gives the impression that the leader of the French Communist Party believes that conflict is not only possible but also imminent. What is the opinion of the Italian Communist Party leader on this point?

Togliatti replied: There is no basis to believe that the Soviet Union harbors (even the slightest) intention of attacking any country, or has taken or intends to take actions that run counter to the national interests of Italy. On the contrary, it was the Soviet Union that dealt the decisive blow that led to the defeat of Fascism. Therefore, I believe that discussing the assumption of a war between the Soviet Union and Italy is absurd. If anyone raises such an assumption, it merely indicates that he believes that Italy must wage an anti-Soviet war for the same reasons that American tycoons want to engage in such a war. American tycoons want to engage in such an anti-Soviet war precisely because the Soviet Union is not a capitalist country but a socialist country. It is quite clear that this is not an assumption about a national war, but a typical policy of reactionaries and capitalists, the purpose of which is to oppose social progress, to oppose the class and ideological war of the working people. In this case, it is quite clear what position those who support social progress and socialism and oppose reaction should take.

Second question: Once a conflict occurs and the Soviet army is forced to pursue aggressors on Italian territory, what position, in your opinion, will the Italian working masses and the people take?

Togliatti replied: As for the assumption of the Soviet army pursuing aggressors on our territory, in this case, I believe that the direct responsibility of the Italian people - who can only denounce any aggression - is to provide the Soviet army with the most effective assistance and to give the aggressors the punishment they deserve. The Italian people - at least the overwhelming majority of the active and militant part of them - feel exactly this way about this issue. Declaring this to the world immediately will undoubtedly facilitate deterring aggressors and maintaining peace.

　　托格里亚蒂答复记者称
    美反动派如敢挑起反苏战争
    意人民将援助苏军打击侵略
    【新华社陕北二日电】塔斯社罗马讯：意共总书记托格里亚蒂对“新闻晚报”记者所提两个问题的答复，于二月二十六日在该报刊出。问题与答复如下：
    第一个问题：法共领袖多列士所发表的关于假如苏军被迫追击侵略者至巴黎时，法国劳动群众和法国人民所将采取之立场的声明，使人产生了一种印象，好象法共领袖认为冲突不但是可能的，而且离现在不远。意共领袖对这一点的意见如何？
    托格里亚蒂答：没有任何根据可以认为，好象苏联怀有（即使是一点点）攻击任何国家的意图，或者采取了或打算采取与意大利民族利益背道而驰的行动。相反地，正是苏联给予了决定性的打击，才使得法西斯主义溃败。因此，我认为，讨论关于苏联与意大利之间发生战争的假定，是荒唐可笑的。假如有任何人竟提出这种假定，这仅仅表示他认为，好象意大利必须以与美国富豪们想从事这种反苏战争的相同的理由，而进行反苏战争。美国富豪们想从事这种反苏战争，正是因为苏联不是资本主义国家而是社会主义国家。十分清楚，这不是关于民族战争的假定，而是反动派和资本家的典型的政策，这一政策的目的就是反对社会进步，反对劳动人民的阶级的与思想的战争。在这种情形下，支持社会进步和社会主义及反对反动的人们，应当采取什么立场，是十分清楚的。
    第二个问题：一旦冲突发生，苏军被迫在意大利领土上追击侵略者，依你的意见，意大利劳动群众和人民将采取什么立场呢？
    托格里亚蒂答：至于谈到苏军在我国领土上追击侵略者的假定，在这种情形下，我认为：意大利人民——他们惟有痛斥任何侵略——的直接责任，就是予苏军以最有效的援助，予侵略者以应得的教训。意大利人民——至少是其中占压倒多数的积极的和富有战斗性的部分——对这一问题的看法正是如此。立刻向全世界声明这一点，无疑地将便利于阻遏侵略者与保持和平。
