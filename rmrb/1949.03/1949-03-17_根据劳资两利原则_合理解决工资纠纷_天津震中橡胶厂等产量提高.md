　　Based on the principle of "developing production, mutual benefit for labor and management," the wage disputes between Tianjin's Zhenzhong Rubber Factory and Beiyang Match Factory have been resolved satisfactorily. The former appropriately increased wages due to wages being too low; the latter appropriately reduced wages due to wages being too high. Workers in both factories, having their livelihoods somewhat guaranteed, have increased their enthusiasm for production, and output has subsequently increased. Before the wage issue was resolved, Zhenzhong Rubber Factory's average daily output was 200 pairs of tires; now it has increased to 270 pairs. In terms of quality, the number of defective tires has decreased from 20 pairs per day before liberation to three or four pairs. Beiyang Match Factory has also increased production from 22 boxes per day to 38 boxes. The factory management also expressed satisfaction with the increased output. The owner of Zhenzhong Rubber Factory has decided to recruit more workers, rush to repair factory buildings, and expand production.

　　Before Tianjin's liberation, wages in general private factories were very low. Workers at Zhenzhong Rubber Factory, in addition to eating at the factory, only earned 18 to 35 yuan in pseudo-gold yuan per month. With the rapid devaluation of pseudo-gold yuan, in December of last year, each worker's monthly wage was not enough to buy one jin of corn flour. Workers' lives were extremely difficult. At Beiyang Match Factory in December of last year, due to the low market price of matches, they colluded with Kuomintang military police and secret agents to force workers to accept wages in matches, thereby increasing exploitation. Ordinary male workers, working 12 to 14 hours a day, could only get 16 packs of matches, which were not enough to buy two jin of corn flour (the factory did not provide meals). Female workers and child laborers only got about one jin of corn flour. At the beginning of this month, workers at Zhenzhong Rubber Factory requested the factory to appropriately increase wages to ensure a certain standard of living for the workers. The factory management simply delayed and refused to resolve the issue. Later, with the full support of the Tianjin Office of the Preparatory Committee of the North China Federation of Trade Unions, they mediated based on the principle of "mutual benefit for labor and management," and a new wage standard was established. In addition to the factory providing meals for the workers, according to the workers' production skills and production efficiency, the daily wage was set from six jin to ten and a half jin of corn flour per person. At the same time, the management of Beiyang Match Factory felt that the recent wage increase was too high, and the monthly wages (in matches) were too much, affecting the expansion of reproduction. Based on this situation, the staff of the trade union first patiently educated the workers of Beiyang Match Factory that they should consider the long-term interests and appropriately reduce the current excessive wage standard while ensuring a certain standard of living, so that both labor and management would benefit. At the same time, it was proposed that workers have freedom of assembly and speech, that the management must improve factory safety equipment as much as possible, and bear the medical expenses for work-related injuries. The past crimes of the management colluding with reactionary military police to oppress workers were severely criticized, and the management admitted the mistakes it had made in the past.

### 根据劳资两利原则　合理解决工资纠纷  天津震中橡胶厂等产量提高

　　根据劳资两利原则
  　合理解决工资纠纷
    天津震中橡胶厂等产量提高
    【天津电】根据“发展生产、劳资两利”原则，天津市震中橡胶厂与北洋火柴厂的工资纠纷，已获圆满解决。前者因工资太低而适当的提高了工资；后者因工资过高而适当的减低了工资。两厂工人因为生活得到一定保障，生产情绪提高，产量随之增加。露中橡胶厂在工资问题解决前，平均日产外胎二百对，现已提高到二百七十对。在质量上由解放前每日有残带二十对减至三、四对。北洋火柴厂亦由日产二十二箱，增加到三十八箱。厂方亦因产量提高，表示满意。震中橡胶厂主已决定再招收一部份工人，赶修厂房，扩大生产。
    在天津解放前，一般私营工厂的工资都很低微。震中橡胶厂的工人，除在厂中吃饭外，每人每月只挣伪金圆十八元到三十五元，加上伪金圆券猛烈贬值，去年十二月每人每月工资还不够买一斤玉米面，工人生活极度困难。北洋火柴厂在去年十二月间，因火柴市价低廉，乃勾结国民党军警特务，强迫工人接受将工资改发火柴，以加重剥削。普通男工，每天工作十二至十四小时，每人只能得到十六包火柴，尚买不到二斤玉米面（厂方不供伙食）。女工与童工，只有一斤左右玉米面。震中橡胶厂工人，于本月初要求厂方适当增加工资，以保障工人一定的生活水平，厂方则一味拖延，不予解决，后经华北总工会筹委会天津办事处职工工作组全力支持工人的合理要求，根据“劳资两利”原则进行调解，才重新订立工资标准，除厂方供给工人膳食外，根据工人的生产技术及生产效率，规定每天每人工资由六斤到十斤半玉米面。与此同时，北洋火柴厂资方则因最近工资提的过高，每月所发工资（火柴）过多，影响扩大再生产。职工工作组根据这一情形，首先耐心教育北洋火柴厂工人，应从长远利益着想，在保障一定的生活水平条件下，适当的减低目前过高的工资标准，使劳资双方都有利。同时提出工人有集会、言论的自由，资方须尽可能改进工厂安全设备，并负担因工受伤的医药费等。对于资方过去勾结反动军警压迫工人等罪行，则进行了严正的批评；资方并承认过去所犯错误。
