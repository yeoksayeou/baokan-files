　　Sending Letters Should Not Waste Civilian Labor
Since Mentougou was liberated, a large number of public and private letters have been transferred along the main road from Changxindian to Fengtai. Some are official documents, and some are private letters from staff and primary school teachers. Villages along the road in the outer thirteenth district have two or three farmers waiting specifically to forward them every day. For example, Wolonggang Village sends letters eight times a night. This is too wasteful of civilian labor and affects mass production. Responsible comrades or staff members of various agencies and primary school teachers should review their behavior, pay attention, and not waste civilian labor. All official documents or private letters should be taken to the post office to be mailed.　　　　　　　　　　　Yang Xiumei

　　送信不应浪费民力
    自门头沟解放后，沿长辛店、丰台的大道上，转送公私信件极多。有的是公文，有的是工作人员及小学教员的私信，外十三区沿大道两旁的村庄，每天都有两个或三个农民专等转送。如卧龙岗村一晚便送信八趟，这样太浪费民力，影响群众生产。各机关负责同志或工作人员及小学教员应作检讨，提起注意，不应浪费民力。所有公文或私信应拿到邮局寄出。　　　　　　　　　　　杨秀儒
