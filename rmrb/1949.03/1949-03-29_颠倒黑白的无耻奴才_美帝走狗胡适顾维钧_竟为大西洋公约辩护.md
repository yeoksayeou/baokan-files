　　Shameless lackeys who turn black into white
    American running dogs Hu Shih and Gu Weijun
    Actually defend the North Atlantic Treaty
    Xinhua News Agency, Beiping, 27th - At a time when Chinese people's organizations are issuing angry roars against the North Atlantic Treaty, American imperialist running dogs Hu Shih and Gu Weijun are rushing to make a feeble defense of this shameful document of aggression. Hu Shih made a statement to a reporter from the Kuomintang Central News Agency in Taipei on the 22nd, openly supporting the expansionist policies of American imperialism. Although the whole world knows that it is not the Soviet Union that has run to the vicinity of the United States to establish military bases and organize war preparations, but rather the United States that has run to the vicinity of the Soviet Union to establish military bases and organize war preparations, Hu Shih brazenly reverses black and white, saying that the North Atlantic Treaty "can prevent the outbreak of a third world war," because "the first and second world wars both arose because the attitudes of both sides were not clear enough. If William or Hitler had understood the intentions of Britain and the United States at the time, the two tragedies would not have occurred. The North Atlantic Treaty has clearly divided the barriers between the two worlds, but it is precisely because of this that each side can be vigilant and fearful, and can avoid repeating historical mistakes." Hu Shih's reactionary argument is not surprising, as he has long been notorious for defending the American imperialist policy of supporting the aggression of Japan and Germany. However, Hu Shih's argument, with a slight modification, is correct: it is precisely because the Soviet Union and the world's people's forces of peace and democracy have promptly exposed the conspiracy of American imperialism and world reactionaries to provoke a new war, giving this conspiracy a serious blow, that the latter cannot but be vigilant and fearful, and a new war can indeed be avoided. Gu Weijun, the Kuomintang puppet government's ambassador to the United States, made a statement in Washington on the 18th, saying: "The North Atlantic Treaty is a remarkable achievement in the cause of peace and security." Those who firmly support counter-revolutionary war are those who support the North Atlantic Treaty. This fact accurately exposes the true nature of the North Atlantic Treaty.

### 颠倒黑白的无耻奴才  美帝走狗胡适顾维钧　竟为大西洋公约辩护

　　颠倒黑白的无耻奴才
    美帝走狗胡适顾维钧
    竟为大西洋公约辩护
    【新华社北平二十七日电】当中国人民团体纷纷发出反对北大西洋公约的怒吼的时候，美帝国主义走卒胡适和顾维钧连忙替这个可耻的侵略文件作无力的辩护。胡适二十二日在台北对国民党中央社记者发表谈话，公然拥护美帝国主义的扩张政策。虽然举世咸知并不是苏联跑到美国周围去建立军事基地和组织战争准备，而是美国跑到苏联周围去建立军事基地和组织战争准备，但是胡适却公然颠倒黑白，说是北大西洋公约“可以防止第三次大战之爆发”，因为“第一并第二次大战之起，均系由于彼此态度不够明朗所致。倘当时威廉或希特勒洞悉英美之心腑，两次惨祸不致演出。大西洋公约固已明显划分两个世界之壁垒，然正可因此使彼此有所戒备及畏惧，而可不再蹈历史覆辙”。胡适的这种反动论调并不令人惊异，他老早就以辩护美国帝国主义扶植日本和德国的侵略势力而声名狼藉了。但是胡适的这一论调，只要稍为改一下就对了，这就是：正因为苏联和世界人民和平民主力量及时揭发了美帝国主义和世界反动派的挑拨新战争的阴谋，给予这一阴谋以严重的打击，使后者不能不有所戒备及畏惧，新的战争的确是可以避免的。国民党伪政府驻美大使顾维钧，他十八日在华盛顿发表谈话称：“北大西洋公约是和平与安全事业上的显著成就。”坚决拥护反革命战争的人就是拥护北大西洋公约的人。这个事实恰好暴露了北大西洋公约的原形。
