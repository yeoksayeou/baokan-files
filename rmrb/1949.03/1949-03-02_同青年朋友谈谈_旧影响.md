　　Talking to Young Friends About "Old Influences"
    Ding Ling
    This manuscript is a part of a speech given by the writer Ms. Ding Ling to the New Democratic Youth League of Harbin Fourth Middle School in the school's auditorium.
    　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　——Xinhua News Agency
    Today, my speech is a speech at a study session. I am the first speaker. Please discuss whether what I say is right or not.
    This speech is difficult for me because we are not familiar with each other. You wouldn't recognize me if I walked down the street. But the problem isn't just unfamiliar faces, but that we have lived differently in the past, thought differently, and I have just arrived here and haven't done any investigation or research yet. But we also have things in common. We are in the same era, the great era of people's liberation; we are both intellectuals; we are both walking the same road, the road of transforming ourselves, participating in the revolution, and serving the people. This road is generally the same. This road is very wide, and if there are any differences, it may be that some walk closer to the inside, some closer to the outside, some walk straight, and some walk in a winding way, but the direction is the same.
    Today you are really very happy, you don't have to fumble around like we did when we were young. On August 15, 1945, the Northeast was liberated, and light came. You all know now that life should be for serving the people, even children can say these five big characters. It is easy to say "Serve the People," but it is not so easy to actually do it. So we should first understand ourselves, recognize ourselves, and examine how many new things in our thoughts and feelings conform to this slogan. You must believe that you are all brand new. Yes, youth is relatively pure. But this is in relation to the old society, to the old people of the old society. To be honest, we young people also have old things. This is not surprising, because we grew up in China's old society, and we are still influenced by it.
    What kind of society was China in the past? It was a semi-feudal society. Although the feudal system is easy to overthrow, feudal ideology and feudal culture are not so easy to get rid of. What was learned in the old society was basically feudal culture, one aspect of which we must inherit as the legacy of human knowledge, while the other aspect must be negated. For example, feudal society talked about "loyalty to the emperor," but we don't talk about that, our infinite loyalty is given to the people. Feudal society talked about "filial piety to parents," but we cannot regard our feelings for our parents as higher than everything else, we cannot be "filial" to a father who is a traitor and a secret agent. Reading the history of the past, it is all about emperors and high officials, they are all "good people," they all look "beautiful," and they are all "talented in both literature and martial arts." From the day we started school, we admired these characters, and also said that this was "having great ambitions at a young age." But what are they really? Aren't they all oppressors of the people!
    Those who haven't gone to school have always heard old novels, right? That's also the old stuff. What scholar and young lady secretly make a lifelong commitment in the back garden, what going to the capital to take the imperial examination, and then coming back to marry several wives, and also calling it the Twelve Beauties, Qin Xuemei mourning, if an unmarried man dies, the woman has to remain a widow for life. This is of course to serve the ruling class, there is no mourning for the poor. After it's over, it's also called "chaste and virtuous," to let everyone learn. Everyone knows the Seven Heroes and Five Gallants, right? The so-called heroes in it wear night clothes, carry swords, and walk on walls, but after talking about it, they are just bodyguards for the emperors and generals. The nickname of the Southern Knight Zhan Zhao is Imperial Cat, isn't that very obvious? Old operas are the same, they are feudal culture. You see how beautiful those feudal emperors and bureaucrats are, with clear eyebrows and bright eyes, red lips and white teeth, a long beard, and a very dashing appearance, with many guards. The common people wear a shirt that is neither too long nor too short, and smear a white patch on their nose, they have to be ugly. You say, who do you want to learn from after seeing this? Who do you admire? At that time, would you want to serve that white-nosed clown for life? Furthermore, if you don't watch operas, you always have a home, right? But what is talked about in the family is also inevitably influenced by this kind of feudal rule. In the old society, it would be really strange to be born a revolutionary without being influenced by the old feudalism.
    Before August 15th, young people in the Northeast had no way of knowing Mao Zedong, and had no way of knowing the five big characters "Serve the People." Of course, new ideas were not completely absent here, but the vast majority of young people had no opportunity to approach them, and approaching them would lead to imprisonment. Everyone knew that the Red Army was frightening with its blue faces and fangs, but they thought that Lin Daiyu in Dream of the Red Chamber was good. Lin Daiyu is weak and sickly, has lung disease, is yellow and thin, is scheming, and cries every day, what's good about that! But once old things have influenced you and become a habit, it is difficult to change. In addition to these feudal things, there are also comprador things. I don't know much about the situation here, but in Shanghai, many people like American things, such as American glass stockings and so on. Many people in Shanghai have an American item on their bodies. Many people like to watch American movies, the vast majority of which represent imperialist culture. Listening to songs, how many kinds of Chinese folk music are there, how many good tunes do the common people like to listen to, but some young people like English songs from American movies, singing them like having malaria, pretending to understand even if they don't. Writing articles also likes foreign styles, using them to reflect the lives of Chinese workers and peasants, it becomes clumsy and awkward. These were left behind by the comprador class in order to curry favor with imperialism. When the Japanese were here, they also vigorously promoted the Japanese Bushido spirit, so there must be more or less some influence.
    In addition to the feudal and comprador culture mentioned above, there is also a theory that is democratic on the surface but anti-democratic in practice, using the past views and methods of treating the reactionary ruling class to treat the people and the people's regime. This is very dangerous! This kind of erroneous thinking is not easy to identify without careful study. Today, although the influence of feudalism and compradorism still exists, if it is openly displayed, everyone will definitely not believe it. For example, if you insist that today there needs to be an emperor, who would pay attention to you? But not recognizing that we have already reached the era of the people being the masters, and moving out the things that were used to treat the reactionary ruling class and using them indiscriminately, this is easier to have a market than feudal things. For example, "dare to fight and dare to scold," this sentence was said by Mr. Lu Xun more than 20 years ago to the Northern Warlords and their lackeys. In that era of warlord rule, it was right to advocate that the people should have the heroic spirit of daring to act against that tyrannical ruler. But now the era has changed, the people themselves are in charge, and it is not right to unconditionally promote this sentence again. Being consistent with the people is called democracy; opposing the people, opposing the people's regime, and opposing the people's liberation war, this is anti-democracy. For example, if I give a speech here, everyone can raise different opinions for discussion. But if someone, in order to show that he "dares to fight and dares to scold," insists on coming up and pounding his chest, insisting that he is right, and insisting that everyone follow him to overthrow someone, what do you think, is this kind of "dare to fight and dare to scold" right? Does anyone agree with him? Even if a few young people are confused and think that this is a hero and shout "good," I can definitely say that this kind of hero is not needed! Is a heroic spirit needed in the new society? Yes, but this heroic spirit should be expressed in new places, it should be expressed in learning, it should be expressed in transforming old ideologies, it should be expressed in doing more work and completing tasks ahead of schedule, it should be expressed in being brave in the struggle against the enemy and not being afraid of sacrifice. Our heroism is not personal, it is not specifically for personal fame, status, personal rights and feelings. That kind of individual heroism, baring its teeth and brandishing its claws, is really ridiculous. But this kind of individual heroism is not only found in the bourgeoisie, but also in the petty bourgeoisie. We all come from petty bourgeois backgrounds, and we must understand the characteristics of this class. This class has vacillation and duplicity, it can be revolutionary and it can be counter-revolutionary. The broad masses of the petty bourgeoisie were oppressed and exploited in the old society, so they can follow the proletariat. When the people become the masters, some of the upper strata and upper-level intellectuals among the petty bourgeoisie feel dissatisfied. They want to steal the fruits of victory of the people and the proletariat. They are not satisfied with the various treatments they enjoy, they always feel that what they enjoy is too little, they want to replace the old ruling class and climb on the heads of the people to act like overlords. But the people and the proletariat do not allow them to do so. The people and the proletariat can only do things according to principles, if you are good, we will support you, if you are not good, we will ask you to step down. So this kind of petty bourgeois element feels wronged, feels oppressed, and wants to point fingers, make a fuss, act pretentious, deceive people and scare people, and sell the opposite of what they say! We must be able to distinguish them, we must expose them.
    We should not lightly believe in other people's speeches and their hawking. We must study their true goods, study the content of their thoughts. We must learn to criticize. In today's new society, there will still be some dregs left over from the old society, and these dirty things will often be wrapped in some beautiful paper, saying good things but doing bad things. They use this to develop their personal bad things, those things that are not in harmony with the people. For example, a few days ago, a friend took me to the "circle" outside the Daowai district. He told me that in the past, every room upstairs here had bright electric lights, and there were beauties standing under the lights, but now it's dark and there are no lights, it's not prosperous anymore. What is this place? It is the market, the human flesh market. After I saw it, I felt that this lack of prosperity is right, it is the place of light. This is the light exchanged for with the blood of the people. What do we want the human flesh market for! But someone told me that someone looked at this situation and felt emotional, and also wrote an article. So some people without brains also feel that this is a "true" thing! The lights went out, the people left, and they also feel emotional. Here we have to ask him: What are you sad about? You feel that it is not as good as before, you feel that it would be bad if there was no human flesh market in the era of the people's government, what else does this kind of argument mean other than representing those playboys, representing the exploiters of the feudal era? Young people will be able to smell this rotten smell if they use their brains a little.
    How should we cultivate the ability to criticize? We must think and discuss more, and develop criticism and self-criticism. Some petty bourgeois elements cannot stand criticism, they like warmth, and feel that it should not be mentioned so seriously when others criticize them. This is also an old influence at work. If a sore grows and you don't say it's bad, how can you bear to cut it off? Insisting on covering up your own dirty things may seem very heroic and give you a lot of face for the time being, but in the end you still can't cover it up, and it will still be dirty in front of the masses, what's good about that? Not being afraid of others saying that you have shortcomings, and being brave in correcting shortcomings, will lead to continuous progress. If everyone can always be vigilant and get rid of the above-mentioned old influences, then we can truly talk about serving the people.

　　同青年朋友谈谈“旧影响”
    丁玲
    此稿系作家丁玲女士在哈尔滨第四中学礼堂对该校新民主主义青年团所作讲演的一部分。
    　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　——新华社
    今天我的讲话是一个学习会上的讲话。我是第一个发言人。我讲的对不对，请大家来讨论。
    我这个讲话是有困难的，因为我们彼此不熟。我走在街上你们不会知道我。但是问题还不是面孔不熟，而是我们过去生活得不一样，思想得不一样，而我又刚刚来到这里，还没有调查研究。但是我们也有相同的地方。我们同是处在一个时代，伟大的人民解放的时代；同是知识分子；同是走着一条道路，走着改造自己、参加革命、为人民服务的道路。这条路大体上是一样的。这条路很宽，如果说是有些差别吧，也可能在走的时候，有的靠里一些，有的靠外一些，有的直走，有的曲折些，但方向是一个。
    今天你们实在是很幸福，不必象我们年青时摸索了又摸索。一九四五年的八一五，东北解放了，光明就来了。你们现在都知道人生应当为人民服务，连儿童都会说这五个大字。“为人民服务”这五个字，说着是很容易，但要真正做到却不那么容易。所以我们应该先了解一下自己，认识一下自己，检查检查自己在思想情感里有多少新的东西符合于这个口号。你们一定相信你们都已经是崭新的。是的，青年是比较纯洁的。但这是对旧社会，对旧社会的老年人而言的。老实说，我们青年也有旧的东西。这毫不奇怪，因为我们是在中国的旧社会生长大的，而且现在也还受它的影响。
    中国过去是一个什么社会呢？是个半封建的社会。封建制度虽然容易打垮，而封建思想、封建文化却不是那么容易去掉。在旧社会里所学的基本上是封建文化，这种文化的一个方面是我们必须当作人类知识的遗产而来继承的，其另一个方面却必须否定。比如：封建社会讲要“忠君”，我们就不讲这个，我们的无限忠心是给与人民的。封建社会讲“孝亲”，我们就不能把对父母的感情看得高于一切，我们就不能“孝”于当汉奸当特务的爸爸。读从前的历史，那上面讲的尽是皇上和大官，他们都是“好人”，都长的“漂亮”，都“文武全才”。我们从念书那天起就崇拜这些人物，还说这是“少有大志”。其实他们是些什么东西，他们还不都是压迫人民的！
    没念过书的，总听过旧小说吧！那也是旧的一套。什么秀才和小姐在后花园里私订终身，什么进京赶考，回来就娶上几个老婆，还叫什么十二金钗、秦雪梅吊孝，没结婚的男人死了，女的还得守活寡。这当然是为统治阶级服务的，没有给穷人吊孝的。完了还说是“节烈”，让大家学。七侠五义，大家都知道吧？那上面的所谓英雄穿夜行衣，拿宝剑，飞檐走壁，但是说来说去，无非是给帝王将相们保镖的。南侠展昭的外号就叫御猫，这不是说得很明显吗？旧戏也是一样，是封建文化。你们看那些封建帝王和官僚是多样漂亮，眉清目秀，唇红齿白，五绺长须，排场潇洒得很，保驾的很多。老百姓穿件不长不短的衫子，鼻子上抹块白，得是个丑。你们说大家看了以后向谁学啊？羡慕谁啊？那时你们会想要终生终世要去替那个白鼻子丑角服务吗？再说不看戏，总还有个家吧！可是家庭里谈的也免不了受这种封建统治的影响。在旧社会里不受旧的封建的影响，而是天生的革命，那才真是奇怪呢。
    东北的青年在八一五以前，大家就没办法知道毛泽东，就没办法知道“为人民服务”这五个大字。当然新的思想在这里也不是没有，但绝大多数的青年是没有机会接近，接近了就要坐牢。大家知道的是红军青面獠牙可怕，倒觉得红楼梦里的林黛玉好。林黛玉弱不禁风，肺病，又黄又瘦，心眼多，天天哭，有什么好呢！但旧的东西一经影响了成为习惯，是很难改变的。除了这些封建东西之外，还有买办的东西。这里的情形我不大知道，在上海有许多人是喜欢美国东西的，什么美国玻璃袜子等等。在上海许多人身上都有件美国货。许多人看电影喜欢看美国电影，这种电影的绝大部分是代表着帝国主义文化。听歌吧，中国民间有多少种音乐，有多少很好的调子老百姓都喜欢听，但有些青年却喜欢美国电影里的英文歌，唱起来象发疟子似的，不懂也装懂。写文章也喜欢外国气派，用来反映中国工农大众的生活，便弄巧成拙，很不得劲。这些都是买办阶级为了巴结帝国主义而给留下的。日本在时，也大肆宣传日本的武士道精神如何如何，因此也要多多少少的受些影响。
    除了上面说的封建的买办的文化以外，还有一种表面上民主、实际上反民主的理论，用过去对待反动统治阶级的看法和办法来对待人民，对待人民的政权。这个很危险！这种错误思想，不好好研究，就不易辨识。今天封建的买办的影响虽然仍在，但公开摆出，大家就一定会不相信了。比如硬要说今天需要有个皇上天子，谁还会去答理呢？但是不认识今天我们已经到了人民作主的时代，把过去对待反动统治阶级的东西搬出来到处乱用，这就比封建的东西容易有市场。比如“敢打敢骂”，这句话是鲁迅先生在二十多年前对北洋军阀及其走狗说的。在那个军阀统治时代，对那个横暴的统治者，鼓吹人民要有敢作敢为的英雄气概，是对的。但现在时代变了，当家人是咱们人民自己，要再无条件地宣传这句话就不对了。与人民一致才叫民主；反对人民，反对人民的政权，反对人民解放战争，这就是反民主了。比如，我在这里讲话一大家尽可以提出不同的意见来讨论。但是假如有一个人为了表示自己“敢打敢骂”，偏要跑上来大拍胸膛，硬说自己的对，硬要旁人都随他来打倒某某人才行。你们想想看，这种“敢打敢骂”对不对呢？有没有人赞成他呢？即使有少数青年会被迷惑，以为这样才是英雄，叫一声好，但是我肯定说，这种英雄是要不得的！在新社会里要不要英雄气概？要，但是这种英雄气概要表现在新的地方，要表现在学习上，要表现在改造旧的思想意识上，要表现在多干工作，提前完成任务上，要表现在对敌人斗争勇敢，不怕牺牲上。我们的英雄主义，不是个人的，不是专门为个人的名誉地位，个人的权利和感情。那种个人英雄主义，张牙舞爪，实在是很可笑的。但是这种个人英雄主义，不但资产阶级里有，小资产阶级里也是有的。我们大家都是小资产阶级出身，我们要懂得这个阶级的特点。这个阶级有动摇性，两面性，可以革命，也可以反革命。小资产阶级的广大群众在旧社会是受压迫受剥削的，因此他们可以跟无产阶级走。当人民大众当了家时，小资产阶级中间的某些上层分子和上层知识分子，就觉得不满意了。他们想窃取人民大众和无产阶级的胜利果实。他们不满意他们所享受的各种待遇，总是觉得他们所享受的太少了，他们要想代替旧的统治阶级爬在人民头上作威作福。但是人民大众和无产阶级不让他们这样做。人民大众和无产阶级只能照原则办事情，你好就赞成你，不好就请你下来。于是这种小资产阶级分子就觉得受了委屈，受了压迫，就要指指点点，吹吹嚷襄，装腔作势，骗人吓唬人，打着金字招牌，卖相反的货色！我们一定要能辨别，要揭穿他们。
    我们不要轻信别人的讲话和他的叫卖。我们要研究他的真正的货色，研究他的思想的内容。我们要学会批判。在今天的新社会里，也还会有一些旧社会留下来的渣滓，这些脏东西也常常会在外边包上一些漂亮的纸，讲的好，做的坏。他们利用这个来发展个人的坏东西，那些与人民大众不协调的东西。譬如前几天有个朋友领我到道外“圈里”去。他告诉我过去这里每间楼上都有雪亮的电灯，而且灯下站得有美人，现在呢，黑漆漆的没有灯了，不繁华了。这是什么地方呢？是市场，是人肉市场。我看了过后，觉得这种不繁华是应该的，正是光明之处。这是人民鲜血换来的光明。我们要人肉市场干什么！可是却有人告诉我说，有人看看这种情境而感慨起来，还写了文章。于是也有没有脑子的人也觉得这个是“真”事呀！灯儿灭了，人去楼空，也随之感慨起来。在此我们就要问他：你感伤什么？你觉得不如从前了，觉得人民政府时代没有了人肉市场会不好，你这种论调，除了代表那些花花公子，代表那些封建时代的剥削者以外，还有什么意思？青年们只要稍稍用点脑筋就会嗅出这种腐烂的味道的。
    我们应该如何养成批判的能力呢？我们要多思索、讨论，展开批评与自我批评。有些小资产阶级分子是受不了批评的，他们喜欢温情，别人批评了还觉得不应该提得那么严重。这也是一种旧影响在作怪。试问长了疮不讲它坏，怎么能舍得割掉呢？坚持掩护自己的脏东西，暂时似乎很英雄，很够面子，但最后还是掩护不了，还是要脏在群众之前，这有什么好呢？不怕人家说有缺点，勇于改正缺点，才会不断地进步。大家如果能时时警惕和摆脱上述的这些旧影响，那才谈得上真正为人民服务了。
