Presenting Poems, Gifts, and Holding a Joint Celebration
　　Beiping Workers and Students Enthusiastically Support the Army

　　[Our Newspaper's Report] The movement to support the army in the ten districts of Beiping has reached a climax. Forty-eight workers from the Yongli Match Factory alone bought two dozen towels, two dozen bars of soap, and four pencils to support the army. Worker representative Sun Wencheng said, "The People's Liberation Army and the workers are one family. They are fighting at the front, and we are producing in the rear." Citizen representative Xing Dehai, to express his love and respect for his own army, voluntarily participated in the work of the comfort sub-committee during the day and pedaled a pedicab at night. He said, "Just expressing my feelings!" All the workers of the Juxing Thread Shop wrote a poem to comfort the soldiers: "People's Army, so brave, fighting bravely, not afraid of danger. People's Liberation Army, so enthusiastic, fighting to liberate the people in Jiangnan. A pen, a towel, express our sincere heart in comforting comrades." Xie Yuying, a third-grade student at Yubin Elementary School, said in a letter to the soldiers: "My mother gave me five yuan, I did not spend it, but used it to comfort the brave soldiers. Don't think it's too little, take it as a small gift." (Qi)

　　[Another Report] The Beiping Tenth District Comfort Sub-Committee held a warm get-together with the garrison troops in the district at the Yongli Match Factory in Fangshengchi at 9:00 am yesterday (the 27th). More than 500 people voluntarily participated, and the atmosphere was extremely warm.

　　[Another Report] Beiping students are enthusiastically launching a campaign to support the army. As of yesterday afternoon (the 27th), the Beiping Student Union had received a total of 315 comfort letters from universities, middle schools, and elementary schools (including faculty and staff), 541 bars of soap, 76 hand towels, 213 notebooks, 290 bags of tooth powder, 61 boxes of tooth powder, 23 tubes of toothpaste, 115 toothbrushes, 32 boxes of matches, 10 helmets (donated by the Women's Affiliated High School of Normal University), 6 and 2/8 packs of cigarettes, and 9 silk banners. In addition, some students directly delivered comfort items to the district government. The enthusiasm of elementary school teachers and students to support the army is particularly high. For example, Cao Fang and Liu Beibei, elementary school students from the Fourth District, jointly sent three jin and fourteen liang of white sugar to the People's Liberation Army and wrote an extremely innocent letter, saying: "Liberation Army comrades: We are two girls aged ten and eight. Now we are sending you some white sugar, please drink sugar water, because we like to drink sugar water very much. Children Cao Fang and Liu Beibei bow."
