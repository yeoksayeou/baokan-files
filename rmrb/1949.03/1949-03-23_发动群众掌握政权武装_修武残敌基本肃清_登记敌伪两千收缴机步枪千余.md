　　Mobilize the Masses to Master Political Power and Armaments
    Remnants of the Enemy in Xiuwu Basically Eliminated
    Two Thousand Enemy and Puppet Personnel Registered; Over One Thousand Machine Guns and Rifles Confiscated
    [Taihang News] The work of eliminating the remnants of the enemy in Xiuwu County, northern Henan Province, has achieved great results in three months since it began in late November last year. According to statistics, the county originally had 3,500 enemy and puppet remnants. Apart from those captured and escaped, 2,147 have now been registered. A large number of weapons have also been seized, including one small cannon, 21 machine guns, 27 pistols, 468 rifles, 818 blunderbusses, 47 ten-round rifles, 36,067 rounds of ammunition, 513 hand grenades, 145.7 shi (石) of grain, and 137 items of clothing. The main reason for these achievements is the attention paid to mobilizing and organizing the broad masses of working people, creating a mass movement to eliminate the remnants. In the Second and Fourth Districts, reason-based struggle meetings were held to examine the crimes and weapons of the remaining bandits, forcing the enemy and puppets to bow their heads and hand over their weapons. In the First, Second, Fifth, and Seventh Districts, the masses carried out small-scale reason-based struggles against certain landlords and bad elements who attempted to control political power and evade paying public grain. Many villages also conducted criticism and self-criticism within the peasantry, exposing the conspiracies of landlords and bad elements to bribe and threaten people. For example, at a poor people's meeting in Dongguan, four women, including Shi Changliu's mother, confessed to accepting bribes, and recalling the past exploitation by landlords, they couldn't help but burst into tears. The masses who had been deceived by the enemy for a time also quickly awakened after education. This greatly strengthened the people's sense of ownership, and the majority joined the peasant associations, with political power and weapons being grasped by backbone elements and activists. According to statistics, only 15 villages in the county, accounting for 12% of the total, have not completely eliminated the remnants. The work of eliminating the remnants is continuing.

　　发动群众掌握政权武装
    修武残敌基本肃清
    登记敌伪两千收缴机步枪千余
    【太行讯】豫北修武县肃清残敌工作，从去年十一月下旬开始，三个月时间获巨大成绩。按该县原有敌伪残余三千五百人，除被俘和逃跑者外，现已登记者达二千一百四十七人。并搞出大批武器，计小炮一门，机枪二十一挺，手枪二十七支，步枪四百六十八支，决枪八百一十八支，十子连枪四十七支，子弹三万六千零六十七发，手榴弹五百一十三颗，粮食一百四十五石七斗，被服一百三十七件。获得这些成绩的主要原因是注意发动和组织广大劳动人民，造成了群众性的肃残运动。二、四区通过说理斗争会，检查残匪的罪恶和枪支，迫使敌伪低头，并交出枪支。一、二、五、七等区群众，对某些企图掌握政权、逃避出公粮的地主、坏分子，进行了小型说理斗争。很多村庄并在农民内部，开展批评与自我批评，揭露了地主、坏分子的收买、威胁等阴谋。如东关贫民会上，石长榴娘等四个妇女，说出了自己受贿的事情，追忆过去备受地主剥削，不禁痛哭失声。曾一时为敌人欺骗的群众，经过教育也很快醒悟过来。这样大大加强了人民的主人翁的信念，大多数都加入了农会组织，政权和武器掌握到骨干和积极分子手里。据统计：该县肃残尚不彻底的村庄仅有十五个，占总数的百分之十二。现正继续肃清中。（林湘）
