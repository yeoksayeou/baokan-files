To Division Commander Zhang, Chief of Staff Fan, Regiment Commander Li, Deputy Regiment Commander Ma, and all uprising officers and soldiers of the 282nd Division: We are pleased to hear that under the leadership of Division Commander Zhang and others, your division revolted in southern Anhui on February 7, resolutely broke away from the Kuomintang reactionary camp, crossed the Yangtze River northward, entered the liberated area, and joined the People's Liberation Army. At a time when the Kuomintang reactionaries are torn apart, on the verge of collapse, and attempting to use peace conspiracies to slow down the development of the people's revolutionary forces, in order to gather the remaining reactionary forces and prepare to continue resisting the People's Liberation Army, your division exposed the peace conspiracy of the Kuomintang reactionary government and resolutely stood on the side of the people. We express our warmest welcome. We hope that you will quickly reorganize your troops, establish revolutionary political work, and rapidly transform them into a true people's army, advancing in the great and victorious revolutionary struggle.
