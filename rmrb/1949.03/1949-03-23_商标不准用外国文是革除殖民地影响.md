Comrade Cui Zhong:

Regarding the North China People's Government's prohibition of using any foreign languages or their phonetic spellings on trademarks and signboards of products from public enterprises, the main intention is to eradicate the remnants of such colonialist thinking and practices, and this principle is correct. As for the new writing system mentioned in your letter, it is different from foreign languages or their phonetic spellings. If there is a commercial necessity, such as for export goods requiring the use of foreign languages, you can request instructions from the government based on the actual situation.

　　商标不准用外国文是革除殖民地影响崔中同志：
    关于华北人民政府禁止公营企业的生产品的商标上及招牌上用任何外国文字或其拼音字，其用意主要在革除此种殖民地思想作风的残余，这个原则是对的。至来函所提新文字，则与外国文字或其拼音字不同。如因商业上的必需，如出口商品须用外国文字者，则可按实际情形请示政府办理。
