　　The Yangquan Dayou Smelting Furnace Cooperatively Managed
    Buke

　　Of the 492 raw and cooked iron furnaces in Yangquan City, 458 are cooperatively managed by workers. The Dayou Smelting Furnace in Zhenjia Village is one of the better-managed cooperative furnaces.

　　The Dayou Furnace was established three years ago. At that time, it raised 40 shares, each share being one shi (a unit of dry measure) of millet. Nineteen shares were in cash, and 21 workers invested labor shares (using wages to offset capital, with a daily wage of eight jin of rice, actually receiving four jin, and after offsetting the full amount, receiving the full wage). This was a form of shareholding cooperation, and Yang Yongtian was publicly elected as manager. Later, there were changes. After the rainy season in 1948, Yang Yongtian was still appointed as manager. At this time, the number of workers had been reduced to 18. The old stock of 50,000 jin of iron and over 30,000 jin of hóng stone were converted into 21 shi of millet as the capital of all workers and management personnel, with each person having one share, continuing cooperative production. The manager is responsible for overall leadership, purchasing raw materials, and promoting sales of finished products. An accountant manages the accounts, keeps and distributes living materials, and the deputy manager manages factory affairs and controls raw materials. The remaining workers directly participate in the production of the iron furnace.

　　The workers of Dayou Furnace are the direct producers of the boilers and also the owners of the iron furnace. Everyone shares in the profits and losses, so they are all very concerned about their livelihood. Taking saving raw materials as an example: each furnace is loaded with 1,000 jin of smothered iron. After casting the pot, the slag generally yields about 100 jin of iron, and they have to completely crush and inspect it each time. The workers of Dayou Furnace are also very careful when making charcoal, raking the charcoal with a rake after a while to reduce the waste of broken charcoal. Only during the accounting period (every twelve days) do they separate the coal dust and useless charcoal that cannot be used in the furnace and carry them home. This is a major event for small producers. Saving 100 jin of charcoal is equal to three jin of rice, and losing 100 jin of iron is equal to ten jin of rice. The workers are only afraid that their own delays will affect everyone's production. For example, the worker who pats the crucible pats 63 crucibles a day, which is enough for one furnace the next day. Because he is the village chief, he is afraid of being delayed by meetings and affecting the furnace's production. He usually pats 20 more crucibles every day, squeezing out enough for one furnace to use in three days. These phenomena are rarely found among workers in private furnaces. Last year, there was a lot of rain, and according to the workers' experience, it was difficult to make a living, and the output was uncertain. However, due to the efforts of all the workers, the output of Dayou Furnace was still able to maintain normal levels. From July to November of the last lunar year, a total of 1,024 da tuo (large pack) of iron pots were produced (Note 1), with an average of 9.48 da tuo of goods per furnace. Each pot weighed about 21 or 22 jin (ordinary pots weighed 24 or 25 jin). Furthermore, because the skilled workers of Zhenjia Village's Liuyou Furnace assembled the furnace together before the War of Resistance and are now organized together for production, they can understand each other's technical characteristics, which makes Dayou Furnace's products second to none in terms of quantity and quality.

　　One of the reasons for the better cooperation of Dayou Furnace is that the leadership issue has been initially resolved. The management and production management personnel of the furnace are elected by all the workers. The management is meticulous in checking and managing the business and can set an example in helping production and saving raw materials, and everyone has no complaints. Usually, after the pots are produced every day, they meet together, and anyone with problems remembers to correct them. At the end of every two or three accounting periods, all the furnace personnel gather together to discuss and review issues such as production, operation, and sales of finished products. Another factor for long-term cooperation is that there is always a surplus every year. From May 1947 to July 1948 alone, the net profit was more than 9,400 jin of millet in one year. Each worker received 15 jin of millet in addition to their fixed wages, so they were willing to continue cooperative production after each settlement. However, there are still several issues worth raising for study:

　　First, the issue of accumulating funds: Although Dayou Furnace has had three and a half years of cooperative history, there is no fixed method for accumulating funds. They earn how much and distribute how much each year. Therefore, progress in improving technology, improving tools, and expanding production is very slow. The furnace's tradition has always been that the furnace is started in July, and the profits and losses can be seen by February of the following year. If money is earned, the workers can withdraw the surplus through the manager before the final settlement. During the final settlement, most opinions determine how much to distribute and how much to retain. As long as everyone is willing to continue cooperating, only enough raw materials for two to three accounting periods (every accounting period is twelve furnaces) are retained, and the rest is divided equally according to shares. Taking May 1947 to July 1948 as an example, the total net profit for the year was 9,843 jin of rice. According to the distribution of 21 shares, each share should receive 465 jin. After everyone's discussion, each share actually received 335 jin of rice, estimating a net profit of more than 71 percent. Each share retained 133 jin of rice, and the 21 shares retained a total of 2,793 jin of rice, accounting for 28.5 percent of the net profit. This retained fund is the conversion of surplus materials (only enough raw materials for two or three accounting periods). One reason is that the time of annual dividend distribution in May is the lean season, and everyone is always willing to distribute more surplus. The main reason is that they have not established the idea of long-term planning. Furthermore, Yangquan iron furnace workers have very little scientific thinking, and superstitious and conservative ideas are still very strong. They are satisfied with the existing very backward production tools and production technology. They believe that "this is the craftsmanship left by the old people" and that "assembling the furnace is a matter of luck."

　　Second, the issue of improving management: Before the War of Resistance, landlords and rich peasants opened furnaces, relying on their feudal economic foundation, and bought large quantities of ＠ stones and ＠ soil during the summer shutdown period every year because raw materials were cheaper in May and June, and storing raw materials early could reduce costs. ＠ Stones are better to use after being stored for a period of time; however, at most, Dayou Furnace's funds can only buy enough raw materials for more than 30 furnaces, and there is no capital to store more raw materials. In order to solve the difficulty of insufficient funds, they pull relationships everywhere and order empty goods (i.e., pre-order goods and pay in advance), and they sell at high prices regardless of whether they are state-owned or private stores, which easily leads to merchants taking advantage of the situation to engage in speculation and sabotage.

　　Third, the issue of properly adjusting wages: The wage difference between workers with different skills in the furnace is very small. Dayou Furnace's wages are divided into three grades: the first grade, skilled workers, receives 6.5 jin of millet per day; the second grade receives 6 jin; and the third grade receives 5 jin. The main skilled workers in the iron furnace, the large furnace head, old ＠, and large foreman (Note 2), play a decisive role in production. Their wages are only one jin to one and a half jin of rice different from ordinary workers. This wage system has a tendency to egalitarianism. According to the current wage system, it not only affects the production enthusiasm of skilled workers, but also fails to stimulate ordinary workers to learn and improve their skills. This is a relatively common problem in Yangquan iron furnaces.

　　The cooperative experience of Dayou Furnace proves that due to the change in production relations, workers are much better at labor efficiency and saving raw materials than private iron furnaces; however, at the same time, this kind of cooperative furnace still has the weaknesses of general small producers, namely, conservatism, laxity, lack of long-term planning, and non-accumulation of funds. If there is no correct leadership and assistance from state-owned stores, they will inevitably suffer from the intermediate exploitation of merchants. Therefore, the reporter believes that at present, in addition to first planning to organize genuine iron supply and marketing cooperatives to improve this kind of cooperative furnace from the existing foundation, transform it into a truly workers' production cooperative, help it overcome the above-mentioned weaknesses, establish a wage system that rewards technology, a democratic and centralized management system, and a fund accumulation system, it is also necessary to strengthen the party's and trade unions' regular leadership and education of workers. Although Yangquan City is currently a region where industry is the main and agriculture is the secondary, the life education of village branch party members still focuses on the rural set. The Zhenjia Village branch has only discussed iron furnace issues twice in the past six months; the village trade union organization is neither sound nor does it provide much education to workers. Only when these problems are solved can the cooperative iron furnace be consolidated as the lower-level foundation of the supply and marketing cooperative and closely combined with state-owned stores operating iron to jointly develop production in a planned manner.

　　(Note 1) Tuo is a unit of measurement for calculating iron goods. Each tuo of smoking pot is equivalent to 52 jin on the old scale, and some are equivalent to 60 jin.

　　(Note 2) The large foreman is responsible for making molds and casting iron pots with molten iron; the old ＠ is the worker responsible for watching the fire, loading the furnace, and lining the furnace; the foreman is the master craftsman of the simmering iron furnace, responsible for loading the iron ＠, watching the fire, and patting the crucible. The above are all skilled workers.

　　合作经营的阳泉大友烟锅炉
    布克
    阳泉市的四百九十二座生熟铁炉中，工人合作经营的就有四百五十八座。甄家庄大友烟锅炉，就是合作炉中经营较好的一座。
    大友炉在三年前建立，当时集起四十个股子，每股一市石小米，十九个是钱股，二十一个工人入了劳力股（以工资顶资金，每日工资米八斤，实支四斤，顶满后再支全工资），这是一种股份合作的经营形式，公推杨永田为经理。后曾一度发生变化。到一九四八年雨季过后，仍以杨永田担任经理，这时工人已减为十八人，把旧存的五万斤铁，三万余斤ｈóｎｇ石，折米二十一市石，作为全体工人与经营人员的资本，每人一股，继续合作生产。经理负责全面领导，购买原料，促销成品。又由会计一人经营帐目，保管与分发生活资料，副经理经营厂内事务，掌握原料，其余工人都直接参加铁炉生产。
    大友炉的工人是锅炉的直接生产者，又都是铁炉的主人，赔赚人人有份，干起营生来就都很操心。以节省原料为例：每炉装焖铁一千斤，铸锅后检出的渣子一般能捣铁一百斤左右，他们每次都要捣净检净。大友炉的工人打炭时也很细心，打一阵用钯子钯过去再打炭，减少碎炭末浪费。只是到了帐期（十二天为一次帐期），把炉上不能用的煤末乏炭分开担回家里用。这对小生产者是件大事，省一百斤炭等于三斤米，少丢一百斤铁，等于十斤米。工人们只怕自己误工影响了大家的生产。如拍坩锅的工人，一天拍六十三个坩锅，就够次日一个炉使用，因为他担任村长，怕碰上开会耽误了炉上生产，平时每天加拍二十几个坩锅，三天就能挤出一个炉使用的来。这些现象在私人炉的工人里是很少找到的。去年雨水大，照工人的经验是营生不好干，产量没把握，由于全体工人的努力，大友炉的出产量，却仍能保持正常。从去年阳历七月到十一月九帐，共出了一千零二十四大驮铁锅（注一），每炉平均九·四八大驮货，每口锅重量在二十一、二斤左右（普通炉每口锅二十四、五斤重），还由于甄家庄六友炉的技术工人在抗战以前就在一块装炉，现在又组织在一块生产，互相能摸清技术特点，这就使得大友炉的产品在数量和质量上都是首屈一指。
    大友炉合作较好的原因之一，是领导问题初步得到解决。该炉经营与生产管理人员，是他们全体工人推选的，经营检点营生都很周到，并能以身作则帮助生产，节省原料，大家均无怨言。平时每天出了锅，就到一块会会面，谁有毛病，记住改正，每二帐至三帐结束一次帐，全炉人员齐集一起，边谈边扯，很自然的检讨生产与经营推销成品等问题。长期合作的另一个因素。是年年总有盈余，仅一九四七年五月到一九四八年七月，一年内就收到纯利九千四百余斤小米，每个工人除了固定工资外，还分到十五斤小米，所以每次结帐后，都愿意继续合作生产。但是尚有几个问题值得提出研究：
    第一、积累资金问题：虽然大友炉已有三年半的合作历史，但并没有固定的积累资金办法，每年是赚多少，分多少。因此，在改进技术、改良工具、扩大生产上进步很慢。该炉历来的习惯，是七月开炉、第二年二月就能看出盈亏，如果赚了钱，不等大结帐，工人可以通过经理支取盈余。大结帐时大多数意见决定分多少、留多少，只要大伙愿意继续合作，只留下二帐至三帐（每帐十二炉）够用的原料，其余按股平分。就以一九四七年五月至一九四八年七月为例，全年得到纯利九千八百四十三斤米，按二十一股分配，每股应分四百六十五斤，经大家商议，每股实分三百三十五斤米，估纯利百分之七十一强，每股留存一百三十三斤米，二十一股共留米二千七百九十三斤，占纯利百分之二十八点五。这个留存资金就是剩余材料的折合（只够二、三帐使用的原料）。其原因一方面虽然因为是每年五月分红时正是青黄不接的时候，每人总是愿意多分一些盈余，而主要原因还是没有树立长期打算的思想。又因阳泉铁炉工人科学思想很少，迷信、保守思想还很浓厚，满足于现有的很落后的生产工具与生产技术，他们认为“这是老人们留下的手艺”，“装炉是碰运气哩”。
    第二、改善经营问题：抗战以前地主富农开炉，依靠其封建经济基础，每年夏季停炉期，就先买下大批＠石、＠土，因为五、六月原料便宜，早存原料可以减低成本，＠石存放一个时期更好使用；可是按大友炉的资金最多能买三十余炉的原料，没有资本存更多的原料。为了解决资金少的困难，他们到处都拉关系，订空货（即预定货先支款），而且不管公营商店与私营商店拣高价出卖，易致商人乘隙而入，进行投机捣乱。
    第三、适当调整工资问题：该炉不同技术的工人，工资差额很小。大友炉的工资分三等：一等技工每日小米六斤半，二等工资六斤，三等工资五斤。铁炉中的主要技术工人，大炉头、老＠、大把头（注二）在生产中是起决定作用的，他们与普通工人工资只相差一斤至一斤半米，这种工资制度存在着平均主义偏向。按目前工资制度，不但影响技术工人的生产积极性，更不能刺激普通工人来学习和提高自己的技术，这是阳泉铁炉中比较普遍的一个问题。
    从大友炉合作经验证明：由于生产关系的改变，工人劳动效率及节省原料方面，较私人经营铁炉好的多；但同时这种合作炉仍存着一般小生产者的弱点，即保守、散漫、不长期打算、不积累资金等等，如果没有国营商店的正确领导与帮助，他们势必遭受商人的中间剥削。因此，记者认为在目前，除了首先有计划的组织真正的铁供销合作社，把这种合作炉从现有基础上提高一步，改造为名符其实的工人生产合作社，帮助其克服上述弱点，建立奖励技术的工资制度，民主集中的管理制度，与积累资金制度外，还必须加强党与工会对工人的经常领导和教育，现在阳泉市虽然是以工业为主农业为副的地区，但村支部党员的生活教育还是偏重于农村的一套，甄家庄支部半年来只讨论过二次铁炉问题；村工会组织既不健全，也很少对工人教育。只有这些问题得到解决，合作铁炉才能巩固的成为供销合作社的下层基础，才能与经营铁业的国营商店密切结合起来，共同有计划的发展生产。
    （注一）驮是计算铁货的度量衡，每驮烟锅合老秤五十二斤，有的合六十斤。
    （注二）大把头是负责制模用铁水铸铁锅；老＠：是负责看火装炉垫炉的工人；把头：是焖铁炉的大工匠，负责装铁＠、看火、拍坩锅等。以上均为技术工人。
