Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 15th. TASS Moscow Dispatch: On March 10th, Soviet Finance Minister Zverev reported at a joint session of the two chambers of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union on the Soviet Union's 1949 national budget, stating that in 1947 and 1948, the budget of the Soviet state was executed in an atmosphere of apparent profit gained by the Soviet people in their struggle for the further development of the socialist economy. The great organizational work of the Lenin-Stalin party and the extraordinary labor enthusiasm of the Soviet people guaranteed the rapid advancement of industry, agriculture, culture, and the improvement of the material welfare of the working people. The achievements of the Soviet Union's national economic recovery and development plan in 1948 have already powerfully demonstrated this. The development of socialist industry in 1948 accelerated greatly compared to the pre-war years, with total industrial output exceeding the plan by 6 percent. The first three years of the Five-Year Plan exceeded the plan by 3 percent. The total value of industrial production in 1948 increased by 27 percent compared to 1947. The total industrial output in 1948 increased by 18 percent compared to the pre-war level of 1940. Last year also marked significant achievements in agriculture, increased production of consumer goods, and increased retail sales of goods. Significantly more manufactured goods and food were sold to the people last year compared to 1947. Zverev emphasized that the currency reform implemented in 1947 and the abolition of the rationing system were of great importance for the further upsurge of the national economy. As a result of these measures, the amount of currency in circulation adapted to the needs of the economy, and the role of currency in the national economy increased. The decision passed by the Party and government on February 28, 1949, to further reduce retail consumer goods prices is another remarkable testament to the steady development of the socialist economy. The wartime evils in the Soviet Union's currency circulation have been eliminated in a short period, the purchasing power of the ruble has been restored, the material welfare of the working people is rising, and the exchange rate of the ruble against foreign currencies is increasing. However, in capitalist countries, inflation has not eased, but unemployment has increased, and consumer goods prices are also rising. The decrease in the real wages of American workers, the enormous growth of capitalist profits, and the increase in military spending are proceeding in parallel.

Zverev stated that the 1949 national budget submitted to the joint session of the two chambers of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union for review and approval was drafted based on the tasks of the national economy in the fourth year of Stalin's post-war Five-Year Plan. This year, it is necessary to ensure the high-speed development of all sectors of the economy and greatly exceed the production level of 1948.

The total revenue of the Soviet Union's 1949 national budget is 445.208 billion rubles, and the total expenditure is 415.355 billion rubles, meaning that revenue will exceed expenditure by 29.853 billion rubles, which will help further stabilize the Soviet ruble. Taxes collected from the people in 1949 will account for only 8.2 percent of the total budget revenue. This year's budget revenue will increase by 30.17 billion rubles compared to last year's budget revenue, an increase of 9 percent. At the same time, expenditure will increase by 46.5 billion rubles, an increase of 12.6 percent. Zverev pointed out that the main part of the expenditure will be used for the expenses of the national economy and social and cultural measures. Among them, 152 billion rubles are allocated to the national economy, 119 billion rubles are allocated to social and cultural measures, and 79 billion rubles are allocated to the expenses of the armed forces. The total amount of investment in the national economy from budgetary and profit expenditures this year will be 189.9 billion rubles, exceeding the investment amount of 1948 by 27 billion rubles. Following the instructions of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the personal instructions of Comrade Stalin, some far-reaching measures will be taken in the national economy, that is, the state subsidy system for industry and transportation will be largely abolished in 1949, and will be completely abolished by 1950. When discussing the huge plan for capital construction projects this year, Zverev pointed out that along with industrial construction, huge funds will be invested in housing construction, which is of great importance for improving the people's living standards. The state will allocate bonus state funds for the further development of agriculture. The expenditure for developing agriculture in the 1949 budget will be 32.7 billion rubles, while it was 20.5 billion rubles in 1948. The main part of these funds will be used for the expenses of further mechanization of agriculture. Among the expenses allocated to social and cultural measures, the total amount of education expenditure will be 60.8 billion rubles, public health expenses will be 21.6 billion rubles, social welfare expenses will be 21.4 billion rubles, and gifts to single mothers and mothers with many children will be 3.4 billion rubles. State social insurance fees will also be increased. Due to the increase in wholesale prices and railway transportation costs this year, military spending has increased to some extent compared to last year. The appropriations for the armed forces stipulated in the 1949 budget provide the Soviet army defending the freedom and independence of our motherland with all expenses.

    Enlarged Military Budget of British and American Reactionary Groups
Zverev said: The Soviet state is engaged in peaceful, creative labor to restore and further develop the socialist economy. It firmly adheres to a peace-loving policy and strives for peace throughout the world. The Soviet government's peace policy is being openly opposed by the British and American reactionary groups. Due to following a policy of preparing for war, the military spending of imperialist countries has greatly increased compared to before the war. The US military budget for 1948-1949 has increased almost 14 times compared to 1938-1939. The US President's message to Congress pointed out that military spending in 1949-1950 accounted for 38 percent of the total budget. If all appropriations for military purposes are included, US military spending in 1949-1950 will account for more than half of the total national budget. As for the UK, military spending in 1948-1949 increased almost doubled compared to 1938-1939. These figures vividly illustrate the aggressive policies of the US and British leaders today.

　　苏最高苏维埃两院联席会
  　听取本年度国家预算报告
    保证各部经济高速度的发展
    【新华社陕北十五日电】塔斯社莫斯科讯：三月十日苏联财政部长兹维列夫在苏联最高苏维埃两院联席会议上报告苏联一九四九年国家预算说：在一九四七年和一九四八年，苏维埃国家的预算是在苏联人民为进一步发展社会主义经济而斗争所获得的显示盈利的气氛中执行的。列宁、斯大林党巨大的组织工作与苏联人民非凡的劳动热情，保证了工业、农业、文化的突飞猛进与劳动人民物质福利的增进。苏联复兴与发展国民经济的国家计划在一九四八年所获得的成绩，业已有力地说明了这一点。一九四八年社会主义工业的发展较战后前几年是大大加速了，一九四八年工业总产量超过计划百分之六。五年计划头三年超过了计划百分之三。一九四八年工业生产总值则较一九四七年增加了百分之二十七。一九四八年工业总产量较战前一九四○年的水平增加了百分之十八。去年也标志着农业的巨大成绩，消费品产量的增加和货品零售额的增大。去年卖给人民的制成品与食品较一九四七年大大增加了。兹维列夫着重指出：一九四七年所实行的货币改革与配给制的取消，对国民经济进一步高涨有巨大的重要性。由于这些措施的结果，货币流通额适应了经济的需要，货币在国民经济中的作用增加了。一九四九年二月二十八日党与政府通过的进一步减低零售消费品价格的决定，是社会主义经济稳步发展的又一显著明证。在苏联货币流通方面的战争恶果在短期内已经消除，卢布的购买力恢复了，劳动人民物质福利在上升中，卢布与外币的汇率在增加着。但在资本主义国家，通货膨胀并没有缓和，而失业反在增加，消费品价格也在上涨。美国工人实际工资的减低资本家利润的巨大增长及军费的增加是并行的。
    兹氏称：提交苏联最高苏维埃两院联席会议审议与批准的一九四九年国家预算是根据斯大林战后五年计划第四年中国民经济的任务拟订的。今年必须保证经济各部门的高速度发展和大大超过一九四八年的生产水平。
    苏联一九四九年的国家预算岁入总额为四千四百五十二亿零八百万卢布，岁出总额为四千一百五十三亿五千五百万卢布，亦即岁入将超过岁出二百九十八亿五千三百万卢布，这将有助于苏联卢布的进一步稳定。一九四九年从人民征得的税收将仅占整个预算岁入百分之八点二。今年预算收入将较去年预算收入增加三百零十七亿卢布，亦即增加百分之九，同时，岁出增加四百六十五亿卢布，亦即增加百分之十二·六。兹氏指出：岁出的主要部份将用作国民经济及社会与文化措施的开支。其中一千五百二十亿卢布拨予国民经济，一千一百九十亿卢布拨予社会与文化措施，七百九十亿卢布拨作武装部队的经费。今年从预算与利润开支的国民经济投资总额将为一千八百九十九亿卢布，将超过一九四八年投资额二百七十亿卢布。奉联共中央的训令与斯大林同志本人的训令，在国民经济方面将采取若干远大措施，这就是工业与运输业的国家，补助制将于一九四九年大体取消，至一九五○年则将完全取消，兹氏论及本年度基本建设工程的庞大计划时指出：与工业建设同时，将用巨额基金投资于房屋建筑，这对提高人民的生活水平有巨大重要性。国家将对农业的进一步发展拨出奖额国家基金，一九四九年预算中对于发展农业的开支将为三百二十七亿卢布，而一九四八年为二百零五亿卢布。这些基金的主要部份将用在农业进一步机械化的开支上面，在拨作社会与文化措施的经费中，教育经费总额将为六百零八亿卢布，公共卫生费为二百一十六亿卢布，社会福利费为二百一十四亿卢布，给单身母亲与有许多孩子的母亲的赠金为三十四亿卢布。国家社会保险费也得增加。由于今年批发物价与铁路运输费的增加，因而军费比去年有某些增加，一九四九年预算规定给予武装部队的拨款，提供了捍卫我们祖国自由与独立的苏维埃军队以一切的费用。
    英美反动集团军费预算胀大
    兹氏说：苏维埃国家为复兴与进一步发展社会主义经济，正在从事和平的、创造性的劳动，它坚定地遵循着爱好和平的政策，并为全世界的和平而斗争，苏联政府和平政策正遇到英美反动集团方面公然的反对。帝国主义国家的军费由于遵循着准备战争政策，已比战前大大增加。一九四八—一九四九年美国军费预算较一九三八—一九三九年几乎增加了十四倍，美总统致国会咨文指出一九四九年——一九五○年军费占总预算的百分之三十八，如果把为了军事目的的一切拨款都计算在内，则美国一九四九年——一九五○年军费将占全国总预算的一半以上。至于英国一九四八年——一九四九年军费较一九三八——一九三九年增加几达两倍，这些数字生动地说明美英领袖今日的侵略政策。
