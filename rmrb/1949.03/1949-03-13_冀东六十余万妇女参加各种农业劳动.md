(Jidong Electric) In the past year, rural women in the Jidong area have made significant progress in participating in agricultural production. In the past, most women in the area did not have the habit of participating in agricultural labor. After the land was equally distributed in the spring of 1948, the political and economic status of most women improved. This broke the previous erroneous idea of "marrying a man for clothes and food," considering production shameful, and instead, they actively participated in agricultural and sideline production. According to incomplete statistics from the Women's Committee of the Jidong District Party Committee, approximately 600,000 women in the district participated in general agricultural production, estimated to be about 60% of the total number of young and middle-aged women. In the first district of Ninghe, out of 3,841 women aged 18 to 50, 415 participated in spring plowing last year, increasing to 3,394 by the autumn harvest, including 1,130 who participated in heavy labor such as harvesting sorghum and millet, and digging up corn stalks. Chen Yuzhi, the production committee member of Qingnigu in the district, led the women of the entire village to participate in production, personally organizing four women's production teams and teaching four women how to plow. She also managed her own family's 45 mu of farmland very well. Before the equal distribution of land in Zhaogezhuang, Ji County, only 20 women participated in agricultural labor; after the distribution, 180 participated in major agricultural labor. According to statistics from five counties, including Leting and Changli, 6,930 women participated in autumn plowing last year, including 2,314 who learned how to plow, laying the foundation for this year's spring plowing production. Women actively participated in sideline production to overcome famine. In 70 out of 72 villages in the eighth district of Yutian, women participated in weaving mats. In Xiaodingzhuang, 110 women and girls from 72 households participated in weaving mats. In the past, they wove 80 mats per day, but now they can weave 150 mats, earning over 1,000 jin of corn. In 13 villages including Sungezhuang, Sanhe, there were 403 spinners who spun 3,195 jin of yarn in one month last winter, earning 95,850 jin of corn. To prevent food shortages, women in Xinglong County collected large quantities of various green vegetables last autumn and winter. According to statistics from four districts, a total of 166,700 jin of dried vegetables were produced.

The ability to mobilize large numbers of women to participate in agricultural production is primarily due to the widespread organization and mobilization of working women during the equal distribution of land. This involved improving their political awareness through methods such as heart-to-heart talks, recounting sufferings, and digging up the roots of poverty, and struggling against feudal forces. They also received the same amount of land as men, fundamentally changing their position in society and family and boosting their enthusiasm for production. Secondly, the mobilization of women to participate in production has attracted the attention of the entire Party, and women's labor heroes, production models, and active rural women cadres are organized and mobilized to lead women's production in a planned way. During the "March 8th" festival last year, women's forums were held in various places to discuss production, and the 13th sub-district selected 23 production models such as Zhao Huilan to lead and promote women's participation in production. When electing district and village-level governments in Yutian, Fengrun and other counties, efforts were made to ensure that one-third to one-half of those elected were women. There are more than 70 district-level women cadres in Yutian County. Last October, more than 810 village and district-level cadres were trained, and after returning to their villages, they actively led women's production. In this year's spring plowing and sowing, the 15th district specifically proposed mobilizing large numbers of women, and a production work team composed of 40 women cadres was formed to focus on leading and mobilizing women to participate in production.

　　冀东六十余万妇女参加各种农业劳动
    【冀东电】一年来冀东区农村妇女在参加农业生产上，有着显著的进步。全区大部妇女过去无参加农业劳动的习惯，一九四八年春平分土地以后，大部妇女政治、经济地位提高，打破了以前“嫁汉嫁汉，穿衣吃饭”，以生产为可耻的错误想法，而积极参加农业副业生产。据冀东区党委妇委不完全统计：全区约有六十万妇女参加农业生产的一般劳动，估计约占青壮年妇女总数的百分之六十左右。宁河一区有十八至五十岁的妇女三千八百四十一名，去年春耕时，有四百十五名妇女参加，到秋收时增到三千三百九十四名，内有参加收割高粱、谷子、刨楂子等重劳动的一千一百卅名。该区青泥沽生产委员陈玉芝，带动全村妇女参加生产，亲自组织四个妇女生产组，教会四个妇女扶犁。家中四十五亩地庄稼，自己也经营得很好。蓟县赵各庄平分土地前，只有二十名妇女参加农业劳动，平分后，有一百八十名参加农业主要劳动。据乐亭、昌黎等五个县统计，去年有六千九百卅名妇女参加秋垡地，内有二千三百十四名学会扶犁，打下了今年春耕生产的基础。开展副业生产渡荒妇女亦积极参加。玉田八区七十二个村，有七十个村妇女参加织席。小丁庄七十二户有一百一十名妇女及女儿童参加织席。过去每天织八十领，现在能织一百五十领。赚玉米一千余斤。三河孙各庄等十三个村有纺妇四百零三个，去冬一个月即纺线三千一百九十五斤，赚玉米九万五千八百五十斤。为防备粮荒，兴隆县妇女于去年秋冬大量采集各种青菜，据四个区统计，共晒菜一十六万六千七百余斤。
    能够发动广大妇女群众参加农业生产，首先是由于在平分土地中广泛组织发动劳动妇女参加，采用谈心、诉苦、挖穷根等方式提高其政治觉悟向封建势力作斗争，并与男子分得同样一份土地，其在社会家庭中的地位起了根本变化生产情绪提高。其次，发动妇女参加生产，已引起全党注意，有计划地通过妇女劳动英雄、生产模范、农村妇女干部积极分子，组织带动妇女生产。去年“三八”节，各地普遍召开妇女座谈，讨论生产，十三分区并选出赵惠兰等廿三名生产模范，领导推动妇女参加生产。玉田、丰润等县在选举区、村两级政权时，争取有三分之一到二分之一妇女当选。玉田全县有区级妇女干部七十余名。去年十月村、区两级干部有八百一十余名受过训练，回村后积极领导妇女生产。十五地区在今年春耕播种中，特提出发动广大妇女，并由妇女干部四十名组成生产工作队，有重点的领导发动妇女参加生产。
