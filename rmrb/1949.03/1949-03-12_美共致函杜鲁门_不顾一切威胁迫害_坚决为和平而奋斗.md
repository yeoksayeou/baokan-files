　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, March 10th: TASS, New York, March 7th: The Chairman of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the United States, Foster, and General Secretary Dennis, in their open letter to Truman, declared that the Communist Party of the United States will continue to fight firmly for peace, regardless of all threats and persecution. The open letter stated: The war crisis did not originate from the Soviet Union. The American people and the Soviet Union are not responsible for the current tense world situation. The responsibility lies entirely with Wall Street and its bipartisan puppets. Only merchants of death, like Germany's Farben Industries and America's DuPont trusts (both of which are monopoly manufacturers of military chemical industries), incite war and profit from it. The open letter emphasized: We Communists will, as in the past, defend the highest interests of the United States and protect the American people from aggression by enemies at home and abroad. We will continue to urge the American people to control the domestic and foreign policies of the United States. We will continue to advocate, along with millions of Americans, that the United States sign a treaty of friendship and peace with our powerful wartime ally, the Soviet Union, to replace the aggressive North Atlantic Treaty—a reprint of the anti-communist axis. Only by following this path can there be peace and security for the United States and the world.

　　美共致函杜鲁门
    不顾一切威胁迫害  坚决为和平而奋斗
    【新华社陕北十日电】塔斯社纽约七日讯：美国共产党中央委员会主席福斯特和总书记但尼斯，在其致杜鲁门的公开信里宣称：美国共产党将不顾一切的威胁和迫害，继续坚决地为和平而奋斗。公开信写道：战争危机的发生，不是来自苏联。美国人民和苏联对于现在世界形势的紧张，是不担负责任的。责任完全在华尔街和它的两党傀儡身上。只有象德国的法尔本工业和美国的杜邦托辣斯（按它们都是军事化学工业垄断制造者）——贩卖死亡的商人，才挑拨战争并从中获取利润。公开信着重指出：我们共产党人将和过去一样保卫美国的最高利益，保卫美国人民不受国内外敌人的侵犯。我们将继续敦促美国人民控制美国的内政与外交。我们将继续与千百万美国人民一同主张美国与我们强大的战时盟友——苏联——签订友善与和平的公约，以代替侵略的北大西洋公约——反共轴心的再版。只有走这条道路，才有美国和全世界的和平与安全。
