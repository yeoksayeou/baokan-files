    Criticism and Suggestions

　　Suggestion to All Levels of Local Government to Strictly Prohibit Gambling and Wasteful Practices Editor:
    Based on my understanding, gambling has become a very serious problem in various places. For example, in Ciyu Town, Third District of Lingshou, there are nine gambling dens, and women also participate. In the villages of middle peasants, the sums of money won and lost in gambling are very large. There were gambling dens in Dongbaishan last winter, and they still exist. Joint village gambling exists to this day in the area from Xichatou Village in the First District to Xingtangjiazhuang. This situation in the Fourth District not only exists in our county, but also in other areas. This phenomenon greatly affects production and construction, and getting rich, so cadres at all levels must pay serious attention to it, mobilize the masses, launch a mass anti-gambling campaign, and transform and educate gamblers to make them devote themselves to production.
    Our county has already paid attention to this problem and is educating gamblers. According to incomplete statistics, more than 35 people in the First District and about 20 people in the Third District have corrected this problem.
    　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　Gong Faren
    During the first month of this year, there were many gambling dens (mostly secret) in various places. The most serious was in the territory of Huolu County, where people often lost their entire fortunes. Gambling is the biggest obstacle to production. The most important thing is that some idlers often resort to theft after losing all their money, disrupting social order. Now I would like to offer some anti-gambling methods for reference only:
    A. Carry out propaganda and education:
    1. Local theater troupes and propaganda teams should be restored, collectively create new dramas (related to the transformation of gambling), and perform them in large quantities to transform idlers and get them on the right track.
    2. Use blackboards, radio, and other methods to publicize the harm of gambling, and expose gamblers anytime and anywhere, and persuade them to reform.
    B. Strictly investigate those who manufacture gambling tools. There are still some in Shijiazhuang City. The local leading organs should stop this and implement investigations and confiscations.
    C. The government should issue a notice strictly prohibiting gambling.

　　Pedestrians Should Not Walk on Wheat Fields, the Government Should Quickly Repair Roads
    Spring has come and the weather is gradually getting warmer. Wheat seedlings are sprouting, but some people keep trampling on wheat fields next to the road. Some even cut across the wheat fields to make a side road, damaging the wheat seedlings and reducing the harvest. It is hoped that the government will issue an order to prohibit walking on wheat fields, or put a wooden sign "No Walking on Wheat Fields" on the edge of the wheat fields to protect the wheat seedlings.
    Also, some villagers graze sheep in the wheat fields, causing disputes with farmers, such as in Shengfo, Dongguan, Wangzi and other villages in the First District of Pingshan. This is a case where the interests of a few are being lost to the interests of the majority. The leadership should pay attention to this, and the grazing workers should also pay attention and not damage the wheat seedlings.
    In addition, some main roads are broken, and the leadership does not pay attention to repairing the roads. Large and small vehicles bypass the roads and drive into the wheat fields, trampling on the wheat fields. The distance from Pingshan City to Wentang is only forty miles. Because the road is broken, many vehicles drive on the wheat fields, turning them into roads. On this road, three large trucks were damaged and two overturned at one time. It is hoped that local governments should pay attention to repairing the main roads in order to avoid driving on wheat fields.

    批评与建议
　　建议各级地方政府严禁赌博浪费现象编辑同志：
    根据我的了解，当前各地的赌博已成为很严重的问题，如灵寿三区慈峪镇，就有九处赌场，也有妇女参加。中农农村赌场，输赢数目很大，东柏山在去冬就有赌博场子，至今仍有。一区西岔头等村至行唐家庄一带联村赌博，至今仍存在。四区这种情形，不但在我县有，而且其他地区也有。这种现象对生产建设、发家致富极受影响，因而各地机关干部，必须引起严重注意，并发动群众，展开群众性的禁赌运动，改造教育赌徒，使之投入生产。
    目前我县已注意此问题，并教育赌博者，据不完全统计，一区三十五人以上、三区二十人左右，改正了此种毛病。
    　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　贡发人
    今年正月，各地赌场（大部是秘密的）很多，闹的最凶的，要数获鹿县境，往往有输得倾家荡产的。赌博是生产的最大障碍，最主要的就是有些二流子输光后，常发生偷盗行为，紊乱社会治安。今特提供一些禁赌办法，仅供参考：
    甲、开展宣教工作：
    一、各地剧团、宣传队都要恢复起来，集体创作新剧（有关改造赌博的剧），大量出演，借以改造二流子，走向正规。
    二、利用黑板报、广播等方式宣传赌博之害，并随时随地揭发好赌分子，劝其改过。
    乙、严查制造赌具者，现在石门市仍有，该地领导机关应加制止，并实行查获没收。
    丙、政府应发通令，严禁赌博。

　　行人不要走麦田政府赶快修好路
    春天来到天气渐渐暖和，麦苗正在发芽，但有人在大路旁断不了踏坏麦田，更有人横贯麦田走一条岔道，使麦苗受到损害以致减少收成，望政府下令禁止走麦田，或在麦田边插一木牌“禁走麦田”来保护麦苗。
    还有些村人在麦田里放羊，与农民发生纠纷，如平山一区胜佛、东关、王子等村，这是少数利益损失了多数利益，领导上对此要注意，放羊工人也要注意，不要损害麦苗。
    另外有些大道坏了，领导上不注意修路，大小车辆绕到麦地里走踏坏麦田，平山城至温塘只四十里路。因路坏从麦地走成大道的很多，在这条路上，有一次就坏了三辆大车，翻了两辆，希望各地政府应当注意修好大道，才能避免走麦田。
