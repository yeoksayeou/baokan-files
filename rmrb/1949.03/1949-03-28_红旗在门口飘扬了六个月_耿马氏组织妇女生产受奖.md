　　The Red Flag Waves for Six Months at the Door
　  Geng Ma Receives Award for Organizing Women's Production
    [Jinan News] A large red flag inscribed with "Labor Model" has been hanging at the door of Geng Ma's house for a full six months. This was awarded after the land reform in the Fifth District of Guantao last August, due to her exemplary actions of diligence and thrift, leading the women of the whole village to participate in agricultural and sideline production, as elected by the villagers three times. Geng Ma is currently a member of the Youbao Village branch, and is forty years old. Ten years ago, she only had two mu of alkaline land, and her husband died of illness from hard labor. Since then, she has taken on the responsibility of housework and farming, making a living by her own labor. The year before last, she participated in the land reform and was allocated nine mu of land, which further encouraged her enthusiasm for labor. At that time, it was the busy autumn season, and she stayed in the field from morning till night, weeding four or five times, and taking time to accumulate fertilizer, cut green grass, carry water, and add soil. She went barefoot into the manure pit to tramp it down, and the topdressing made the autumn seedlings grow especially well. After the autumn harvest, she also picked up 1,600 jin of grain stubble, enough for a year's fuel. At this time, everyone in the village knew that she was the best working woman. She was praised in the branch and also accepted the task of leading the women to participate in production. She started to promote it throughout the village, but some women felt that women could not do the work in the fields, and the men also thought it was shameful for women to go to the fields. She felt that it was impossible to mobilize all the women in the village at once, so she started with individual mobilization. First, she found Mi Guiniang, a military dependent, and asked her in a casual conversation, "Has the cotton-padded clothes been made for the cold weather?" This question caused Mi Guiniang to complain about her difficulties, so Geng Ma seized on this point to mobilize her, which moved Mi Guiniang to change her mind. Geng Ma immediately lent her colored floss and a spinning wheel, and taught her how to spin. She spun four or five flower ears a day, and the village immediately broadcast a commendation, which made Mi Guiniang even more energetic. She could spin three liang of thread a day, and exchanged work with others to weave cloth, making a brand-new set of cotton-padded clothes. This matter caused a sensation in the whole village. Last summer, the women participated in agricultural labor one after another, with seventy-six people regularly doing field work, and many women participated in fertilizer accumulation, weeding and other work. The status of women has also been improved. Geng Changsheng's wife often suffered beatings and scolding, but Geng Ma mobilized her to join the weaving group and also do field work, which pleased her mother-in-law, who said: "I used to think my daughter-in-law was useless, but this time she has changed beyond recognition." Liu Bao, who used to think it was shameful for his wife to go to the fields, now works in the fields with his wife, chatting and laughing, making them even more affectionate. After winter, the seven weaving groups and one hundred and seventeen young women spinners led by Geng Ma quickly completed one hundred and thirty-two military cloths. In this production process, the mutual aid organization was developed a step further, creating a method of calculating work in collective spinning and weaving under the principle of voluntariness, expanding the labor scope of the mutual aid group and increasing the production volume. Geng Ma's group alone, in addition to weaving twelve military cloths, also wove three cloths for sale. Her group has become a model for the whole village to learn from.

　　红旗在门口飘扬了六个月
　  耿马氏组织妇女生产受奖
    【冀南讯】写着“劳动模范”的大红旗，在耿马氏的大门口整整的挂了六个月。这是去年八月馆陶五区土地改革以后，她以勤俭劳动的模范行动，带领全村妇女参加农业和副业生产，经全村群众三次选举获得的。耿马氏现任有堡村支部委员，四十岁年纪。十年前只有二亩碱地，丈夫因作苦工病死。此后，她就担当起家务和耕作，凭自己劳动过光景。前年她参加了土地改革，分到九亩地，更加鼓舞了她的劳动热情。那时正是秋忙，一天到晚不离庄稼地，锄了四遍又锄五遍，抽空就积肥、割青草、挑水、添土、赤着脚下粪坑去踩，把秋苗上了追肥，收成格外好。秋后，她又拾谷茬一千六百斤，足够一年烧用。这时全村人没有不知道她是一个劳动最好的妇女。在支部里得到了表扬，同时还接受了带领妇女群众参加生产的任务。她开始在村里普遍宣传，但有些妇女都觉得地里活妇女做不了，男人也认为妇女下地丢人。她觉得一下把全村妇女都动员起来是不可能的，就从个别动员着手，首先她找到军属米贵娘，在闲谈家常中，问她：“天冷了，棉衣做好没有？”这一问引起了米贵娘的苦，耿马氏就抓紧这点进行动员，说的米贵娘转变了。耿马氏马上借给她花绒和纺车，教她纺花，一天纺了四五个花穗，村里马上广播表扬，米贵娘更加带劲，每天能纺三两线，又给别人换工织布，做了一套崭新的棉衣。这个事情轰动了全村。去年夏天，妇女们就纷纷参加了农业劳动，七十六人经常做地里活，很多妇女参加了积肥、锄草等工作。妇女地位也提高了。耿常生媳妇常受打骂，耿马氏动员她入了纺织组，又做地里活，喜的她婆婆说：“我先前光看俺媳妇没用，这回变的不象她了。”过去嫌老婆下地丢人的刘保，现在两口子一起在地里做活，说说笑笑更显得亲热了。入冬后，耿马氏领导的七个纺织组和一百十七个青年纺妇，很快完成了一百三十二个军布，在这个生产过程中，把互助组织发展了一步，创造出在自愿原则下伙纺伙织的计工办法，扩大了互助小组的劳力范围，提高了生产量，仅耿马氏一组除织完十二个军布外，又织出三个布出卖。她的小组成了全村的学习榜样。
