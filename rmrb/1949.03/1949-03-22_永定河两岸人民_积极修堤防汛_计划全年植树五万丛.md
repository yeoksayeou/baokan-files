　　People on Both Banks of the Yongding River
    Actively Repair Embankments and Prevent Floods
    Plan to Plant 50,000 Clusters of Trees Throughout the Year
    [This Newspaper's Dispatch] Under the leadership of the democratic government, the people on both banks of the Yongding River are actively engaged in flood prevention. The Yongding River, the second largest river in North China after the Yellow River, suffered from the enemy and puppet regime's use of the embankments for building fortifications during their long-term rule, leaving the embankments dilapidated and the trees cut down. Urgent repairs are needed. This year, the weather warmed up and the river thawed early. Furthermore, due to the southward shift of the flow during last year's major flood, lateral flows, direct impact, erosion, and collapses have been occurring constantly. Under the leadership of the democratic government, the people on both banks of the river and the newly taken-over Yongding River engineering team are actively engaged in emergency repairs. From February 25th to March 16th, a total of 114 willow trees were secured, 205 coils of light cable were used, and over 20,000 catties of reeds and straw were used, and the dangerous situation has been slightly stabilized. To consolidate the Yongding River embankment, in addition to actively repairing the stone embankment and reinforcing the embankment, there are plans to plant more than 50,000 clusters of trees throughout the year.

　　永定河两岸人民
    积极修堤防汛
    计划全年植树五万丛
    【本报讯】永定河两岸人民在民主政府领导下，积极防汛。在华北各河流中，仅次于黄河的第二大河永定河，在长期的敌伪统治下，利用堤岸修筑工事，堤防残破不堪，树木砍伐殆尽，急待修整。今年春暖，河开较早；又由于去年大汛时，溜势南移；不断发生横河、顶冲淘刷坍塌等现象。两岸人民及新接管的永定河工程队在民主政府领导下，积极抢护。自二月二十五日起至三月十六日止，共挂柳一百一十四棵，用光缆二百零五盘，苇、秸料二万余斤，险情稍稳。为巩固永定河堤防，除积极修补石堤，加培堤防外，并计划全年植树五万余丛。
