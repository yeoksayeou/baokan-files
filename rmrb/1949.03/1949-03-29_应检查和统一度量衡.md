Title: Should Check and Unify Weights and Measures

To the Editor:

　　During the past period of Kuomintang rule, weights and measures were unified in name only, but in reality, they were very chaotic. For example, some scales in the market calculated one jin as twelve liang, some as thirteen liang, fourteen liang, or fifteen liang. Often, when people bought things, they would only discover that they were short after taking them home, and the seller would not admit it when they went back. This was very disadvantageous for the masses. Now that Beiping is liberated, and the government is the people's own government, I have still often encountered situations of insufficient weight when buying things on the street recently, especially things like vegetables, meat, fish, and fruit. I hope that the People's Government and the Bureau of Industry and Commerce will thoroughly check weights and measures, educate merchants, and issue announcements. Strictly prohibit things like small measures and light scales from happening, so that citizens can be less exploited by merchants.

　　应检查和统一度量衡编辑同志：
    在过去国民党统治时期，关于度、量、衡，在名义上统一，实际上却很紊乱，譬如市面上的秤有十二两算一斤的，有十三两、十四两、十五两算一斤的，群众买东西，常是将东西买回家后，才发现不够数，再去找他他不承认。这样群众是很吃亏的。现在北平解放了，政府是人民自己的政府了，可是最近我上街买东西，尤其菜、肉、鱼、水果之类，还是常有不足秤的情形发生。希望人民政府及工商局彻底检查度量衡，并对商贩进行教育，发布布告。严禁小斗小秤等事发生，以便市民少受商人的剥削。　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　第三区白绮
