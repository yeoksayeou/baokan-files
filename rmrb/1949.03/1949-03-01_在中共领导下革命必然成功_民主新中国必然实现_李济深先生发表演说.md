Xinhua News Agency, Beiping, 27th: Mr. Li Jishen, Chairman of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang, delivered a speech at the Beiping Welcome Meeting on the 26th:

Fellow representatives from all sectors of the Party, government, military, and people in North China! I am very grateful, very ashamed, and at the same time very excited and happy to attend this grand welcome meeting today. Because this place brings together representatives from democratic parties, democratic groups, and democratic figures from all over the country attending the New Political Consultative Conference, as well as leaders and cadres from all sectors of the Party, government, military, and people in the liberated areas. This conference demonstrates the broadest and most solid unity of all revolutionary classes in the country, which is not only grand but also unprecedented.

Why does this unprecedented people's great unity appear today? The most important reason is the correctness of the Chinese Communist Party's leadership over the revolutionary line. The three major propositions they put forward—anti-imperialism, anti-feudalism, and anti-bureaucratic capitalism—are precisely the unanimous demands of all democratic parties and the unanimous demands of the people of the whole country. In terms of the methods adopted to achieve these three major goals, the Chinese Communist Party has been able to base itself on the lessons of past revolutionary failures in China and take measures that are appropriate to actual needs. All democratic parties in the country can also base themselves on the lessons of past revolutionary failures and recognize that the victory of the Chinese revolution can only be achieved through this one path. Therefore, all democratic parties in the country sincerely wish to unite around the Chinese Communist Party, under the leadership of Chairman Mao Zedong of the CCP, and contribute whatever strength they can.

I firmly believe that the Chinese revolution will inevitably succeed under the leadership of the CCP, and a democratic new China will inevitably be realized. What I have witnessed in the liberated areas, from Dalian to Harbin, of the rapid progress of various democratic constructions, as well as what our friends have heard and seen in the liberated areas within the customs, are powerful proofs.

Now the reactionary forces at home and abroad also admit that the Chinese revolution is about to be victorious, so they are devising various conspiracies and tricks to preserve their power. But these conspiracies and tricks will not succeed. When the Nanjing Kuomintang reactionary faction suffered a military defeat at the end of last year and the reactionary regime was on the verge of collapse, U.S. imperialism, in order to maintain its privileges of dominating China, instructed the large and small reactionary groups in Nanjing to launch a so-called peace offensive, attempting to prolong their lives. Xinhua News Agency immediately published an editorial entitled "Carry the Revolution Through to the End." Later, when Chiang Kai-shek, Sun Ke, and Li Zongren issued so-called statements seeking peace, Chairman Mao Zedong of the CCP put forward eight conditions for achieving genuine and lasting peace. This was necessary to counter the conspiracy of the offensive by U.S. imperialism and the Nanjing Kuomintang reactionary group, and it was also necessary to achieve the establishment of a democratic new China. This is not only the opinion of the Chinese Communist Party, but also the public opinion of the people of the whole country, and the public opinion of all democratic parties, democratic groups, and democratic figures. Mr. Mao's eight peace conditions are a concrete manifestation of the three major propositions of anti-imperialism, anti-feudalism, and anti-bureaucratic capitalism. These eight conditions are a whole and are indispensable. This is the best test of whether the Nanjing Kuomintang reactionary faction is truly sincere in seeking peace. However, the facts shown by the Nanjing reactionary group in the past two months have completely revealed the fox's tail. We should make further efforts to adhere to the three major propositions and eight conditions in order to combat the peace offensive conspiracy of U.S. imperialism and the Nanjing Kuomintang reactionary faction.

Finally, I would like to express my sincere and high respect to Chairman Mao of the Central Committee of the CCP; to the People's Liberation Army who have worked hard and made great achievements; to the people of the liberated areas who have worked hard to produce and support the front lines; and to all sectors of the Party, government, military, and people in North China and Beiping! I also thank you for the grand hospitality and welcome!

　　在中共领导下革命必然成功
  　民主新中国必然实现
    李济深先生发表演说
    【新华社北平二十七日电】中国国民党革命委员会主席李济深在二十六日北平欢迎会上的演词：华北党政军民各界！济深今天来参加这一盛大的欢迎会，是非常感谢，非常惭愧，但同时也是非常兴奋和愉快的。因为这里集合了来自全国各地的民主党派，民主团体，民主人士出席新政协的代表，和解放区党、政、军、民各界的领袖和干部。这一大会显示着全国各革命阶层的最广泛和最巩固的团结，不仅是盛大的而且是空前的。
    为什么这一空前未有的人民大团结会出现于今日呢？最重要原因，是中国共产党领导革命路线的正确。他们所提出的反帝、反封建、反官僚资本的三大主张，正是全国各民主党派一致的要求，也是全国人民一致的要求。在为实现此三大目标而采取的方法方面，中国共产党能本于过去中国历次革命失败的教训，而有恰合实际需要的措施。全国各民主党派，也都能本于过去革命失败的教训，而认定中国革命的胜利，只有这一条道路。因之，全国各民主党派都衷心地愿在中共主席毛泽东先生领导之下，团结在中国共产党的周围，而贡献其可能贡献的力量。
    我深信，中国的革命在中共领导之下是必然成功的，民主的新中国是必然实现的。我进入解放区，自大连以至哈尔滨，所目睹的各项民主建设突飞猛进的事实，还有我们的朋友来关内各解放区所耳闻目见的事实，都是有力的证明。
    现在中外反动派也承认中国的革命是就要胜利了，因此他们想出种种阴谋诡计来保存他们的势力。但是这些阴谋诡计是不会成功的。当去年年末南京国民党反动派军事失败，反动政权濒临崩溃的时候，美帝国主义为了保持其支配中国的特权，指使南京大小反动集团，发动所谓和平攻势，企图借以苟延残喘的时候，新华社即发表了“将革命进行到底”的社论。后来蒋介石、孙科，以及李宗仁发出了所谓求和的声明的时候，中共主席毛泽东先生更提出了实现真正永久的和平的八项条件，这是针对着美帝国主义和南京国民党反动集团的攻势的阴谋所必须的，也是达到民主新中国的建立所必须的。这不仅是中国共产党一党的意见，而是全国人民的公意，也是各民主党派民主团体和民主人士的公意。毛先生的八项和平条件，是反帝、反封建、反官僚资本三大主张的具体表现。这八项条件是整体的，是缺一不可的。这对于南京国民党反动派的是否真有谋取和平的诚意是一个最好的测验。然而，这两个月南京反动集团所表现的事实，却是狐狸的尾巴完全露出来了。我们应更进一步的努力，坚持三大主张，八项条件，以打击美帝国主义和南京国民党反动派的和平攻势阴谋。
    最后，我谨以诚意，向中共中央毛主席致崇高敬礼；向劳苦功高的解放军致崇高的敬礼；向解放区努力生产支持前线的人民大众致崇高的敬礼；向华北、北平党政军民各界致崇高的敬礼，并感谢招待与欢迎之盛意！
