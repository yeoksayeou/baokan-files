　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 10th. Electroneum Prague, 7th. On the eve of the March 8th International Women's Day, the International Union of Students, representing three million members from 54 countries, sent a telegram to women worldwide to congratulate them. The telegram stated: Democratic women must unite with all peace-loving forces in the world to oppose new wars. Because for women, war means the death of their children, husbands, and brothers, and also means the infringement of their basic rights. The telegram declared: "Students pledge to support the common cause of peace. For this cause, women, youth, students, workers, and intellectuals are uniting ever more closely in a single, unbreakable front. Students pledge to support women's just demands for social equality, full access to education, equal pay for equal work, legal equality, and improved living conditions for women around the world, especially in colonial countries."

　　国际民主学生联盟向全世界妇女祝贺
    【新华社陕北十日电】电通社布拉格七日讯：值此三八妇女节前夕，国际民主学生联盟特代表五十四国的三百万会员致电全世界妇女祝贺。该电称：民主妇女必须和世界上一切爱好和平的力量团结一致，反对新战争。因为对于妇女来说，战争意味着她们的儿女、丈夫和兄弟的死亡，也意味着对她们的基本权利的侵害。该电宣称：“学生誓必支持共同的和平事业。为了这个事业，妇女、青年、学生、工人与知识分子正日益紧密地团结在单一的牢不可破的阵线中。学生保证支持妇女关于社会平等，充分受教育的机会、同工同酬、法律平等、及改善世界各地特别是殖民地国家妇女较好生活条件等正当要求。”
