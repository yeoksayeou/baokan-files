　　Ping-Sui Railway Bureau
  　Carefully Adjusts Employee Salaries
    [Zhangjiakou Electric Dispatch] The Ping-Sui Railway Bureau is carefully adjusting employee salaries. Since our army liberated Zhangjiakou, all stations and sections of the Ping-Sui Railway have temporarily borrowed the equivalent of rice based on the old base salary to pay employees' salaries for November and December, which the employees are satisfied with. In order to appropriately meet the workers' demands and further enhance their work enthusiasm, before the North China People's Government's Ministry of Transportation has made an overall regulation on the salaries of railway employees, the Ping-Sui Railway Bureau decided to start individual and careful adjustments on the 15th of last month. A comprehensive revision will be made after the unified decision of the North China People's Government's Ministry of Transportation. The specific method of adjustment is that the administrative takeover personnel of each unit will jointly lead with the trade union, listen to the voices of the workers, discover the objects that should be adjusted, and after discussion and approval by the majority of the workers, request the bureau to carefully consider and approve. During the adjustment, old employees with ability, technical qualifications, and a willingness to truly serve the people will not be discriminated against. The opinions of the workers must be approved by the bureau before they can take effect. Patience should be used to persuade and mobilize the masses regarding incorrect opinions raised by them. This work was completed around the 20th.

  　慎重调整职工薪资
    【张垣电】平绥铁路局慎重调整职工薪资。自我军解放张家口以来，平绥路各站、段已按过去底薪折米暂借给职工十一、十二月份薪资，职工对此表示满意。为适当满足工人的要求，更加提高其工作积极性，在华北人民政府交通部对铁路员工薪金尚未作出全盘规定前，平绥铁路局决定于上月十五日开始先作个别慎重的调整，全盘改订有待于华北人民政府交通部之统一决定。调整的具体办法是各单位行政接管人员会同职工会共同领导，倾听职工群众的呼声，发现应调整的对象，由职工讨论经大多数表决通过后，请求局方慎重考虑、批准。在调整时，对旧职员有能力有技术资历并愿真正为人民服务者，一律不加歧视。工人群众的意见必须局方批准以后，始能生效。对群众提出的不正确意见，要予以耐心说服动员。这一工作，是在二十日左右完成。
