　　All-Soviet Collective Farms Draft Production Plans
    Responding to the Government's Overall Production Increase Plan for This Year
    Ukrainian Farmers Propose New Production Increase Guarantees
    [Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 2nd] According to a Telecommunications Agency report: After the Soviet government issued the 1949 agricultural development plan in advance this year, all collective farms in the Soviet Union, based on this overall plan, are formulating their own production plans for each work team and work group within the collective farm, and are revising the method of assessing work points, reducing the administrative expenses of the collective farms. Many collective farm work teams and work groups are undertaking new obligations to ensure that they exceed agricultural production plans and increase the number and reproduction rate of livestock. In the Ukrainian Republic alone, 31,000 collective farms, 87,000 work teams, and 369,000 work groups have taken on the task of increasing production this year.
    [Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 2nd] According to a TASS report: In late February, collective farmers, workers of machine and tractor stations, and agricultural experts from the Ukrainian Republic, the Soviet Union's largest grain-producing area and famous "granary," jointly wrote a letter to Stalin. They happily reported to Stalin that they had increased grain production, exceeding the pre-war total grain output, and improved livestock breeding. This was the guarantee they had made a year ago. Now, in the letter, they are making new guarantees to Stalin: they will undertake even greater obligations to further increase grain production.

    乌克兰农民提出增产新保证
    【新华社陕北二日电】据电通社消息：苏联政府今年提前颁布了一九四九年发展农业计划以后，全苏联的各个集体农场，都根据这一总计划，给集体农场的每一个工作队和工作组订立自己的生产计划，并且修改按工作日评工的办法，缩减集体农场的行政开支。许多集体农场的工作队和工作组，正担负起新的义务，保证超过农业生产计划，并增加牲畜的数量和繁殖率。仅在乌克兰共和国，就有三万一千个集体农场、八万七千个工作队、三十六万九千个工作组，担负起今年增加生产的任务。
    【新华社陕北二日电】据塔斯社消息：二月下旬，苏联最大的产粮区、著名的“谷仓”乌克兰共和国的集体农民、机器与拖拉机站的工人和农业专家们，共同写了一封信给斯大林。他们以愉快的心情报告斯大林说：他们已增加了粮食产量，超过了战前的粮食总产量，并改善了牲畜饲养。这是他们在一年之前所提出的保证。现在他们在信中又向斯大林提出新保证：他们又要担负起更大的义务，进一步地增加粮食产量。
