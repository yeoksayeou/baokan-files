　　Northeast China Land Reform Partially Completed in Newly Liberated Areas
    [Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 4th] Land reform in the newly liberated areas of Northeast China has been partially completed. In the new areas of Liaobei Province, mainly the areas around Siping and Tieling near Shenyang, there are 55 districts and 1,634 administrative villages. Since more than 1,300 cadres were mobilized to go to the countryside before December last year to carry out land reform, the entire region will have distributed land. Because the cadres initially learned to grasp the policies, there were fewer deviations in their work. Only individual counties and districts were not clear enough about the classification of classes, with slight deviations, but these were corrected upon discovery. In Liaoning Province, in addition to the six districts of Liaoyang County that have completed land distribution, Fushun, Benxi, Liaozhong and other counties, as well as Liaoxi Province, are also in the process of land distribution.

　　东北新解放地区土改已部分完成
    【新华社沈阳四日电】东北新解放的地区土地改革已部分完成。辽北省新区主要是四平周围与靠近沈阳之铁岭地区，共有五十五个区，一千六百三十四个行政村，自去年十二月前动员一千三百余干部下乡进行土地改革后，目前全区将分完土地。由于干部初步学会了掌握政策，在工作中偏差较少，只有个别县区对划分阶级不够明确，略有偏差，但经发现，即予纠正。辽宁省除辽阳县六个区已完成分地外，抚顺、本溪、辽中等县及辽西省，亦正进行分地中。
