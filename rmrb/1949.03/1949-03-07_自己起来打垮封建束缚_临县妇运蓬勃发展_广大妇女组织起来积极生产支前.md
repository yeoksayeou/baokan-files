Xinhua News Agency, Xing County, 5th: The women's movement in Lin County, Shanxi, which flourished during the land reform, was considered relatively good at the Jin Sui Women's Congress. Before the land reform in 1947, women's work was not valued, and the broad masses of women did not recognize their own strength. They did not participate in meetings, and women's organizations were practically non-existent. During the land reform, rural feudal forces were defeated, the consciousness of the rural working people greatly improved, and women also joined the land reform movement. The Outline Land Law stipulated that women should receive the same share of land and property as men, and that women should be on an equal footing with men, which encouraged women's enthusiasm for struggle. Women in many villages automatically rose up to participate in land reform work, and also showed unprecedented initiative in production, disaster relief, and party consolidation work. Before the land reform, many women in the county did not participate in agricultural labor, considering it a "shameful" thing. However, after the land reform, in 1948, the number of women participating in agricultural production reached 70 percent of the county's more than 60,000 female laborers. Many peasant women learned the entire set of agricultural production skills. Liu Houru of Zhaishang Village, because her husband was blind, cultivated the land alone, carrying her child on her back, and supported the whole family. Because Lin County has little land and a large population, women put a great deal of effort into handicrafts and family sideline occupations. In the area of textile production alone, they sold more than 42,000 bolts of homespun cloth in the second half of last year, in addition to their own use. They also made greater efforts than in the past to support the front lines. In 1948, they made 150,000 pairs of military shoes, accounting for half of the total number of military shoes made in the past decade, and 80,000 pairs of these were made in just one and a half months in the autumn. In addition, they sewed tens of thousands of sets of cotton clothes and quilts for the frontline People's Liberation Army. Organized women account for 40 percent of the county's 120,000 women. Their grassroots organization is the "Women's Group," and there are 2,800 such groups in the county. Above the group is the Women's Representative Conference of the administrative village. Recently, the county also established a unified leading body for women's organizations throughout the county—the Women's Federation. Women in Lin County not only have their own separate organizations, but also participate in farmers' organizations. During the land reform movement, more than 20,000 people participated in the Farmers' Association, and 5,700 people participated in the Poor Peasants' Group. Li Huanying, an ordinary peasant woman from Baiwen Town, once presided over a mass meeting of 3,000 people, and showed amazing talent and sophistication. In district and village-level governments, 2,300 women participate in government work, and more than 500 of them hold responsible positions in district and village governments. Women with high awareness are clamoring to join the Communist Party of China. There are now 727 female Communist Party members in the county, an increase of 60 percent compared to before the land reform, accounting for 10 percent of the total number of Communist Party members in the county. Many women have waged tenacious struggles to break free from the remnants of the feudal marriage system. Many underage girls resisted their parents' arranged marriages. When the groom's family carried the bridal sedan chair to greet the bride, they refused to get into the chair, and as a result, the sedan chair had to be carried back empty. The twelfth lunar month is traditionally the marriage month for farmers. Last year, in the twelfth lunar month, 72 girls won victories in resisting early marriage. Among them, 24 people went to the government to file lawsuits and returned to their parents' homes after being forced to marry. Abolishing the buying and selling of marriage and rationally resolving marriage disputes have been noted by most local cadres. They actively support women's liberation. In the past year, on the one hand, more than 300 couples dissolved unreasonable marriage contracts, and on the other hand, dozens of young men and women voluntarily became good matches.

According to a report from the Lin County Women's Federation, the county's women's movement still has many shortcomings. In some villages, women's work is still very backward, the idea of valuing men over women is seriously prevalent, and the system of buying and selling marriage is still secretly practiced. However, compared to before the land reform, it has indeed taken a big step forward.

### 自己起来打垮封建束缚　临县妇运蓬勃发展  广大妇女组织起来积极生产支前

　　自己起来打垮封建束缚
  　临县妇运蓬勃发展
    广大妇女组织起来积极生产支前
    【新华社兴县五日电】在土地改革中蓬勃发展起来的山西临县的妇女运动，在晋绥妇女代表大会上被认为是比较好的。在一九四七年土地改革以前，妇女工作不被重视，广大妇女群众也不认识自己的力量，她们不参加开会，妇女组织等于虚设。土地改革中农村封建势力被打垮了，农村劳动人民的觉悟大大地提高，妇女们也卷进了土地改革运动中。土地法大纲规定妇女与男人分得同样的一份土地、财物，妇女与男子列于同等地位，这就鼓舞了妇女斗争的热情。许多村庄的妇女自动起来参加土地改革工作，在生产救灾和整党工作中也表现了空前的积极性。土地改革之前，该县许多妇女不参加农业劳动，认为那是“可耻”的事。但土地改革后，在一九四八年参加农业生产的妇女，竟达到全县六万多女劳动力的百分之七十。许多农妇学会了农业生产的全套本领。寨上村的刘候汝，因为她的丈夫是瞎子，她背着孩子独自耕种，养活全家。由于临县地少人多，所以妇女把很大的力量投入了手工业和家庭副业。仅在纺织方面，去年下半年她们所织的土布除自己穿用以外，还卖出了四万二千多匹。在支援前线上，她们也比过去更加尽力。一九四八年她们做了军鞋十五万双，占十年来所做军鞋总数之半，而且其中八万双是在秋季一个半月之内赶做成的。此外，她们还为前线解放军缝了几万套棉衣和棉被。有组织的妇女占全县十二万妇女的百分之四十。她们的基层组织是“妇女小组”，全县有二千八百个这样的小组。小组之上是行政村的妇女代表会议，最近该县又成立了全县妇女组织的统一领导机构——妇联会。临县妇女不仅有她们单独的组织，同时也参加农民的组织。在土地改革运动中，参加农会的有两万多人，参加贫农小组的有五千七百人。白文镇的一个普通农妇李焕英，曾主持了一个三千人的群众大会，十分练达，表现了惊人的才干。在区级和村级政府中，有二千三百个妇女参加政权工作，其中五百人以上在区村政府中居于负责地位。觉悟高的妇女纷纷要求加入中国共产党。现在该县有妇女共产党员七百二十七人，比土地改革前增加了百分之六十，占全县共产党员总数的百分之十。不少妇女为了摆脱残余的封建婚姻制度，曾进行了顽强的斗争。许多未成年的少女反抗父母包办婚姻，当婆家抬花轿前来迎亲时，她们拒不上轿，结果花轿只得空着抬回去。腊月在习惯上是农民的婚姻月份。去年腊月有七十二个少女反抗早婚得到胜利。其中有二十四人是在被迫嫁出以后又到政府告状返回娘家的。废除买卖婚姻制度与合理地解决婚姻纠纷，已为大部分地方工作干部所注意。他们积极地赞助妇女解放。去年一年中，一方面有三百多对男女解除了不合理的婚约，而另一方面却有几十对男女青年自愿地配成了佳偶。
    据临县妇联会报告，该县的妇女运动仍存在不少缺点。在某些村庄中妇女工作仍很落后，重男轻女的思想严重地存在着，买卖婚姻制度仍在秘密地流行。但是，比起土地改革以前，确是大大提高了一步。
