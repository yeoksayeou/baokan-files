　　Jibei Company, with the Assistance of Employees, Clears Out Many Off-the-Books Materials
    [Our Newspaper's Dispatch] The Jibei Electric Power Company's Beijing branch's inventory work will be completed this month to strive for an all-out production competition campaign starting in April. To speed up the completion of the inventory, employees have automatically risen up to assist. In addition to repairing lines day and night, line workers have also automatically retrieved materials scattered among the people and returned them to the company, even small parts such as nuts and bolts. The user cards previously used by the Record Section could only be used for one year, and after one year, all 120,000 user cards were scrapped. Now, after research and creation by the entire section, a piece of soft paper is pasted on the card, which can be used for four or five years without damage.
    Due to the automatic assistance of employees, many departments have also inventoried off-the-books materials. Some departments have re-supplemented material reports or automatically checked them in advance. The General Affairs Section alone supplemented reports of thirty-five houses, one hundred and two tea tables, thirteen large and small carpets, twenty-eight square wooden tables, and many other items. Many employees continued to persevere in their work without rest despite being ill. In addition, some shortcomings were also discovered. In the early stage, the stationery warehouse lost the most items, with more than 1,000 sheets of newsprint alone being lost. The Line Section failed to establish a complete plan for the management of equipment and materials, and the Accounting Section also had cases of altering accounts. The above-mentioned shortcomings have all been instructed by the takeover team to the original person in charge to correct them in a timely manner.

　　冀北公司在职工协助下
    清出许多帐外物资
    【本报讯】冀北电力公司北平分公司的清点工作，将争取于本月全部完成，以便四月起全力进行生产竞赛运动。职工们为加速完成清点，都自动起来协助。线路工人除了昼夜不停抢修线路外，又把失散在民间的器材，自动找了回来，甚至连螺丝母这类小零件也送回公司。纪录股以前使用的用户卡片，只能用一年，一年以后，十二万用户卡片全部作废；现经全股研究创作，在卡片上贴一张软纸，可用四、五年也不致损坏。
    由于职工自动协助，许多部门还清点出帐外资材。有些部门又重新补报物资或自动先行核对。仅庶务股就补报了三十五间房子，茶几一○二个，大小地毯十三块，方木桌二十八个及其他东西很多。有许多职工病了仍然不休息继续坚持工作。此外也发现了些缺点。初期，文具库丢失东西最多，仅白报纸即丢了一千多张，线路股对保管器材未能建立完整的计划，会计课并有改帐情形等。上述缺点，都已经接管组指示原负责人及时改正。
