Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 24th. TASS, London, 22nd: British Communist Party General Secretary Pollitt, in an article in the weekly "World News and Views," reiterated his previous statements regarding the attitude of British workers toward an anti-Soviet aggressive war. Pollitt wrote: "I firmly believe that the danger of war comes from the US-British bloc and its war policies, and I firmly believe that the outbreak of war is very unlikely because the forces of peace are greater than the forces of the warmongers. American imperialism intends to make Britain one of its main war bases, with the United States supplying dollars and arms, while British youth will fight and die as substitutes. But these aims will be defeated. The Soviet Union will never launch any war. If an anti-Soviet aggressive war breaks out, workers in all other countries will defend the Soviet Union against all imperialist attacks."

    再斥美英战争政策
　  深信战贩目的将被击败
    【新华社陕北二十四日电】塔斯社伦敦二十二日讯：英国共产党总书记波立特在“世界新闻与评论”周刊上撰文，重申他前几次关于英国工人对于反苏侵略战争所持态度的声明。波立特写道：“我深信战争的危险是来自美英集团及其战争政策，深信战争爆发很少可能，因为和平的力量大于战争贩子的力量。美帝国主义打算使英国成为他的主要战争基地之一，由美国供给美元和军火，而由英国青年去打仗替死。但这些目的将被击败。苏联方面决不会发动任何战争，如果爆发反苏侵略战争，则一切其他国家的工人将保卫苏联，反对一切帝国主义的进攻”。
