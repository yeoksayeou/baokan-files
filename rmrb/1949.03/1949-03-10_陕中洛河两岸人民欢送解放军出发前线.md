Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 8th. Early last month, the people on both banks of the Luo River enthusiastically sent off the People's Liberation Army to liberate central Shaanxi. At the PLA's memorial service for martyrs and the mass meeting of soldiers and civilians to send off the PLA to the front, they tearfully recounted their painful experiences of being persecuted under the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang, demanding that the PLA avenge them! This gave the troops a good education and greatly enlightened the soldiers' class consciousness. Before the departure of the Ninth Company of the Second Battalion, local residents held a meeting to send them off. Residents' representatives told the soldiers about the tragic death of the wife of the landlord of the Seventh Class, who was raped by Hu Zongnan's bandit troops in June last year, and indignantly demanded: "You must capture the bandit Hu Zongnan alive to avenge us!" At the memorial service for martyrs of the Second Battalion of the First Brigade, the wife of poor peasant Gao Shengfa, who was shot dead by the Kuomintang Baochang bully Gao Zhong, specially came to participate. After paying respects before the martyrs' spirits, she cried to the soldiers about the details of her husband's murder, demanding that they fight the Hu bandit troops well! All commanders and fighters were deeply moved and immediately agreed to this just demand. Residents of a certain village sent off the Fifth Company of the First Brigade of Dongcun to the front like sending off relatives. They took the hands of the People's Liberation Army and said, "We hope you will liberate Xi'an City, and then we will go to see you again."

    【新华社延安八日电】洛河两岸的人民上月初旬热烈地欢送人民解放军出动解放陕中。他们在解放军公祭烈士的誓师大会上和欢送解放军出发前线的军民大会上，哭诉自己过去遭受国民党反动统治迫害的惨痛遭遇，要求解放军为他们报仇！这给了部队很好的教育，大大的启发了战士的阶级觉悟。二大队九连出发前，当地居民，开会欢送他们。居民代表告诉战士们七班房东的媳妇在去年六月被胡宗南匪军强奸致死的惨状，悲愤地要求：“你们要活捉胡宗南贼娃子为我们报仇！”在一大队二营的公祭烈士誓师大会上，被国民党保长恶霸高忠枪杀了的贫农高生发的女人特地跑来参加，她在烈士灵前祭奠后，就向战士们哭诉他丈夫被害的经过，要求好好的打胡匪军！全体指战员深受感动，立刻答应了她这一正义的要求。某村居民象送亲人似的欢送东村一大队五连出发前线，他们拉着解放军的手说：“希望你们解放西安城，那时我们再去看你们。”
