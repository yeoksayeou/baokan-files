Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 6th: Reliable sources confirm that the Kuomintang bandit gang is conducting a large-scale military expansion plan under the cover of a "peace" smokescreen. Chiang Kai-shek intends to use Li Zongren for a "peace" offensive, to gain three to six months to restore his combat power. Chiang Kai-shek's war preparation plan includes: First, fully restoring the original establishment of the Kuomintang reactionary army to the designation of one hundred and twenty armies, and attempting to form four hundred divisions. The armies and divisions that have been annihilated by the People's Liberation Army are being reorganized in various provinces. Second, stepping up conscription and recruitment in various places, attempting to recruit 2.5 million people. Third, all retired and transferred Kuomintang military officers of all levels are being recalled and incorporated into "cadre training centers" for short-term training before being used. The bogus Ministry of National Defense's Army Training Command is currently conducting officer recruitment work in various places, and hundreds of people in Shanghai have been admitted and sent to Taiwan for training. Fourth, forming armored units composed primarily of light tanks. Shanghai has now formed six armored battalions. Fifth, expanding the air force and planning to have Americans participate in the air force as volunteers.

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 6th: According to reliable sources: Bandit chieftain Chiang Kai-shek in Xikou is directing Kuomintang bandit gangs in various places to step up military expansion and war preparation plans. Chiang Kai-shek personally directs and appoints officers above the division commander level in the Kuomintang army. The newly arrived military supplies and weapons from the US government's aid to the Kuomintang reactionaries are being distributed by Gu Zhutong, the bogus Chief of General Staff of the Ministry of National Defense, according to Chiang Kai-shek's orders, a large part of which has been designated for the reconstruction of Chiang Kai-shek's direct line troops annihilated in the Huaihai Campaign. The 63rd and 64th armies of the original Huang Baitao Corps are being rebuilt in Guangdong, and the 18th Army of the original Huang Wei Corps is being rebuilt in Quzhou. The army and division commanders of these troops have been appointed. Xue Yue is also planning to expand the Guangdong Security Regiment into five security divisions. The bogus Ministry of National Defense has stipulated that the total number of new recruits in Guangdong Province this year is 200,500, and the Joint Logistics Headquarters of the Ministry has ordered the province to raise enough food for 450,000 people for the whole year. Fujian plans to rebuild five armies in three months, and the commanders of two of the divisions have been appointed. Guan Linzheng, the bogus Deputy Commander-in-Chief of the Army Headquarters, flew to Fuzhou to discuss the organization and training of troops with the provincial authorities. Zhang Qun, director of the Kuomintang Chongqing Pacification Headquarters, decided to organize eighteen armies in the southwest at the Southwest Military and Political Conference of Sichuan, Xikang, Yunnan, Guizhou provinces and Chongqing City held in Chongqing on the 22nd. Cheng Qian, who secretly flew to Xikou to ask bandit Chiang for instructions, is greatly expanding the security forces in Hunan and actively preparing for war. According to another source: When Wu Guozhen, the bogus mayor of Shanghai, met with bandit Chiang in Xikou on the 9th, Chiang instructed him to wait patiently for three months for the war preparations to be completed, and asked him to suppress all Beijing-style peace movements in Shanghai.
