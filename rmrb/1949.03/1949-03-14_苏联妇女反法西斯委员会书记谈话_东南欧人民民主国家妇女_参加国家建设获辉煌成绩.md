Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 12th. TASS Moscow dispatch: Petrova, Secretary of the Soviet Women's Anti-Fascist Committee, recently told reporters: Women in the People's Democratic countries of Southeastern Europe are commemorating "March 8" International Women's Day with new labor upsurges and achievements in economic and cultural construction.

　　The number of women working in industry, agriculture, and government cultural and educational institutions is steadily increasing. Women workers in the textile, leather, and sewing industries in Czechoslovakia account for nearly 60 percent of all workers. In Hungary, women workers account for approximately 30 percent of industry. The governments, trade unions, and women's organizations of the People's Democratic countries are creating all the necessary conditions to help women learn various professions. The Polish Women's League uses various training classes to train 13,500 industrial workers with high-level skills. Women in the People's Democratic countries are playing an active role in labor competitions, and they are struggling to complete or overfulfill their countries' national economic plans ahead of schedule. Maria, a milling technician at Hungary's largest nationalized enterprise, said: "We must accelerate the restoration of our country. We know that the country belongs to us, and we are building the country for ourselves." Maria produces 250 to 270 percent of her production quota every day.

　　In the past year and a half, Bulgarian women have voluntarily worked millions of workdays in restoration and construction, saving the country 135 million leva.

　　Farm women are also making great contributions to the economic development of the People's Democratic countries. Eighteen women who participated in the conference of advanced agricultural workers in Hungary were awarded the Outstanding Farmer Medal for the first time in Hungary.

　　In order to eliminate women's illiteracy, the People's Democratic countries have universally organized specialized training classes and schools to educate adults to read and write, and have expanded cultural and educational activities. Romania has opened more than 9,000 literacy schools. More than 40,000 women in Albania are learning to read and write. In Poland, female students account for 41 percent of all students in higher education institutions.

　　With the development of culture and politics, women's political activities and their participation in social life are also increasing. In old Romania, women did not have the right to vote. In the new democratic Romania, 33 women were elected members of the National Assembly, 30 women became mayors, and two women served as secretaries-general of government ministries. Bok, a daughter of the Romanian people, was appointed Foreign Minister of Romania. In Bulgaria, 38 women were elected members of the National Assembly. In Poland, 25 women were elected members of parliament.

　　The governments of the People's Democratic countries are creating all the necessary conditions so that women can combine the responsibilities of being mothers with participating in the country's economic, social, and political life.

　　Women in the People's Democratic countries are actively fighting in the ranks of the Women's International Democratic Federation for lasting peace among nations and against war instigators. Women are participating in the anti-Franco movement and in the movement to defend Greek democracy and oppose the bloody terror of the Greek royalist fascist government. The Soviet Union's proposals on disarmament and the prohibition of atomic weapons at the last United Nations General Assembly have been warmly supported by women in the People's Democratic countries. 2.5 million women in Czechoslovakia and 2.25 million women in Bulgaria have signed in support of the Soviet proposal.

　　苏联妇女反法西斯委员会书记谈话：
    东南欧人民民主国家妇女
  　参加国家建设获辉煌成绩
    【新华社陕北十二日电】塔斯社莫斯科讯：苏联妇女反法西斯委员会书记彼得洛娃顷对记者发表谈话称：东南欧人民民主国家妇女以新的劳动高涨、经济与文化建设各方面的成绩纪念“三八”国际妇女节。
    在工业、农业、政府文化教育机关工作的妇女正日益增加。捷克斯洛伐克纺织、皮革、缝纫工业女工将近全体工人的百分之六十。匈牙利工业中女工约占百分之三十。人民民主国家的政府、职工会与妇女组织正在创造一切必需条件来帮助妇女学习各种职业。波兰妇女联盟以各种训练班训练一万三千五百名有高度技术的产业工人。人民民主国家妇女在劳动竞赛中起着积极的作用，她们正在为完成或提前完成她们国家的国民经济计划而斗争。匈牙利最大的国有化企业的磨机技工马利亚说：“我们必须加速恢复我们的国家。我们知道国家是属于我们的，我们正在为我们自己而建设国家。”马利亚每天生产其生产定额的百分之二百五十到二百七十。
    过去一年半保加利亚妇女在恢复与建设的工作中自愿地工作了几百万个工，为国家节省了一亿三千五百万保币。
    农妇对人民民主国家经济发展的贡献也很大，参加匈牙利先进农业工作者会议的十八名妇女在匈国首次荣获优秀农民奖章。
    各人民民主国家为了消灭妇女文盲业已普遍组织了专门的训练班和学校，教育成人读和写，扩大了文化教育活动。罗马尼亚业已开办了九千余所文盲学校。阿尔巴尼亚有四万余妇女正在学习读和写。在波兰，女学生占全体高等教育机关学生的百分之四十一。
    随着文化与政治的发展，妇女的政治活动以及她们对社会生活的参加也日益增加。在旧罗马尼亚妇女没有选举权。在新民主的罗马尼亚，三十三位妇女当选国民议会议员、三十位妇女当了市长、两位妇女担任政府各部的秘书长，罗马尼亚人民之女波克被任命为罗国外长。在保加利亚，三十八位妇女当选国民议会议员。在波兰二十五位妇女当选议员。
    各人民民主国家的政府正在创造一切必需条件，以便妇女能够把做母亲的责任和参与国家的经济、社会与政治生活结合起来。
    人民民主国家妇女正在国际民主妇女联盟的岗位上为各国间的持久和平，为反对战争挑拨者而积极地斗争。妇女们参加反佛朗哥运动，参加保卫希腊民主与反对希腊保皇法西斯政府血腥恐怖的运动。苏联在上次联合国大会上提出的裁军和禁止原子武器，在人民民主国家妇女中得到热烈的拥护。捷克斯洛伐克有二百五十万妇女、保加利亚有二百二十五万妇女签名拥护苏联这一提案。
