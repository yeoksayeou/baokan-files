Shijiazhuang Tongjuxing Manager Falsely Reports Closure
	Shop Assistants Submit Articles Exposing Him
    [Shijiazhuang News] Since Shijiazhuang reasonably corrected the illegal behaviors of certain shop owners and bosses who abused workers, shop assistants, and apprentices, and appropriately stipulated monthly salaries and year-end bonuses, the consciousness of workers, shop assistants, and apprentices has been increasing daily. They can consciously report the illegal behaviors of shop owners and bosses to the government and the trade union. Many activists have become correspondents for the Shijiazhuang branch of the news agency. According to reports from new correspondents Du Yuegang and Mi Shancheng: The manager of Tongjuxing basket shop in the Third Street of the Second District of the city dismissed apprentice Wang Dadong without reason. In order to evade occupation fees and industrial and commercial taxes, he falsely reported "closure" while secretly continuing to operate. After Wang Dadong reported this to the trade union, the trade union and the head of the Second Street investigated and confirmed the facts. The manager admitted his mistake on the spot, and the street government has decided to order him to pay the occupation fees (the industrial and commercial tax issue is under investigation). The manager also agreed to give Wang Dadong a year-end bonus of 2,000 new currency. During the Kuomintang rule, Wang Dadong was arrested by the Kuomintang secret service "Nineteen" for being sent to the Liberated Area to purchase goods for the shop and suffered torture. After liberation, he helped the shop reorganize its business, but the manager was ungrateful and dismissed Wang, which caused great indignation among the workers and apprentices.

　　石市同聚兴经理虚报歇业
  　店员投稿公开揭露
    【石家庄讯】石市自从合理纠正某些店东老板虐待工人、店员、学徒的非法行为，并适当规定了月薪及年终酬劳金以后；工人、店员、学徒的觉悟程度日益提高。能自觉的向政府、工会揭发店东、老板的非法行为。许多积极分子已成为石家庄分社通讯员。据新通讯员杜月岗、米善诚报导：该市二区三街同聚兴箩圈铺经理无故开除学徒王大东。并为了逃避职勤费和工商税虚报“歇业”，暗自经营。经王大东向工会陈述后，经工会与二街街长调查属实，该经理当场承认错误，街政府已决定叫他补交职勤费（工商税问题正在研究），该经理并允许给王大东新币两千元的年终酬劳金。按王大东在国民党统治时期，曾因为柜上派赴解放区购货，为国民党特务机关“十九号”逮捕，受过苦刑，解放后又帮助该号重整业务，而该经理竟忘恩负义将王开除，在工人、学徒中引起很大愤慨。
