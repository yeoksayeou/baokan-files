Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 28th—Reports from various sources: French Communist deputies, during a meeting of the French National Assembly on the 24th, requested the French government to declare its faithfulness to the Franco-Soviet Pact. At this meeting, reactionary deputies, led by the followers of de Gaulle, demanded that the French Communist Party, accused of "accepting orders from a foreign country," be declared illegal, and called for the "indictment" of Thorez. French Communist leaders Thorez and Duclos, in their speeches in the National Assembly, vehemently denounced the shameless clamor of these reactionaries. Thorez first read out the full text of his speech delivered at the French Communist Party Central Committee meeting on the 22nd. He declared: The Soviet Union never attacks other countries. Socialist countries cannot adopt the aggressive policies inherent to imperialists. The Soviet army—the heroic defender of Stalingrad—has never attacked any country. Thorez continued: The question now is war—war against our ally, the Soviet Union—or peace. He also stated: We have a responsibility to explain to the country the true source of the current threat to peace, and to explain what attitude friends of peace should take if warmongers implement their plans. The current situation is: the French government is actively participating in the aggressive policies of American and British imperialism. As a result of anti-Soviet agreements, a foreign general staff—the headquarters of the Western European Union—has been established in Fontainebleau (approximately forty kilometers southeast of Paris). Military bases have been ceded to the United States. We are now being invaded by foreign economic, cultural, and tourists. We call on the French people to unite against this policy. We propose the organization of a democratic coalition government. Thorez, in reiterating his statement of the 22nd, warned the French reactionaries that if France is ultimately driven to war against the Soviet Union, the French working class and the French people will adopt the attitude taken by the working class in Poland and other countries, and stand on the side of the Soviet Union. In his speech, Duclos condemned the French government for violating the Franco-Soviet Treaty signed in December 1944 and for implementing a policy of war. Duclos asked the deputies of the government party: "Why are you so bloodthirsty? Because you are afraid of peace. In your view, war can solve all difficulties." At this point, the French Communist deputies, holding the largest number of seats in the National Assembly, formally proposed a motion demanding that the government declare its faithfulness to the Franco-Soviet Pact and declare the abolition of agreements that hand France over to imperialist warmongers. After a night of intense debate, the National Assembly finally passed a motion on the morning of the 25th that concealed the French government's treacherous policies, grandiosely claiming to "trust the government to safeguard the country's independence." The French Communist Party's just proposal was rejected, but most of the reactionary deputies, intimidated by the French Communist Party's prestige among the people, did not dare to raise their hands in support of the reactionary motion proposed by the fascist de Gaulle party demanding the "indictment" of Thorez, and it was also rejected.

　　法共议员提出建议
  　要求政府忠于法苏协定
    【新华社陕北二十八日电】各方报导：法共议员在二十四日法众院会议中要求法国政府宣布忠实于法苏协定。在这次会议上，以戴高乐分子为首的反动议员，曾要求宣布所谓“接受处国命令”的法共为非法。并“检举”多列士。法共领袖多列士与杜克洛在众院发表的演说中，痛斥这些反动分子的无耻喧嚣。多列士首先宣读他于二十二日在法共中央会议上演说的全文。他宣称：苏联从来不进攻其他国家。社会主义国家不可能采取帝国主义者所固有的侵略政策。苏维埃军队——斯大林格勒的英勇保卫者，从未进攻过任何国家。多列士继称：现在的问题是战争——对我们盟国苏联的战争——还是和平的问题。又称。我们有责任对国家说明现在和平威胁的真正来源，说明假如战争贩子实行他们的计划时，和平之友应该采取什么态度。目前的情况是：法国政府积极参与美英帝国主义的侵略政策。由于反苏协定的结果，枫丹白露（按在巴黎东南四十公里）已设立了一个外国参谋部——西欧联盟的司令部。军事基地已让予美国。我们现在正受到外国经济、文化与旅行家的侵入。我们号召法国人民团结起来，反对这种政策。我们建议组织民主联合政府。多列士在重申其二十二日的声明时警告法国反动派说：若果法国最后被驱使对苏作战，则法国工人阶级和法国人民将采取波兰等国工人阶级所采取的态度，站在苏联方面。杜克洛于演说中谴责法国政府违反一九四四年十二月签订的法苏条约，并执行战争政策。杜克洛向政府党议席问道：你们“为什么这样嗜血？因为你们害怕和平。在你们看来，战争可以解决一切困难。”至此，在众议院居于第一大党地位的法共议员们正式提出议案，要求政府宣布忠实于法苏协定，宣布废除把法国交给帝国主义战争贩子的协定。经过澈夜继续的激辩之后。众院最后于二十五日晨通过一项掩盖法国政府叛卖政策的议案，侈谈什么“相信政府维护国家的独立”。法共的正义提案被否决，但大多数反动议员慑于法共在人民的威信，对法西斯戴高乐党提出的要求“检举”多列士的反动议案，亦不敢举手赞成，而予以否决。
