　　Fire Line Rescue Heroines Li Landing and Jiang Nanping
  　Introductions to National Women Representatives

            (I)
    In the radiance of victory, we often recall those difficult days on the front lines of the People's Liberation War. Now, let me introduce a true story: When female medical worker Zhao Yanan offered a blood transfusion to Teng Maoren, who had just awakened from a coma, he resolutely refused, choking with emotion, "You have taken care of me day and night already, it is not right to harm your health for my sake! I can't bear it." After repeated comfort and persuasion, he wrote Zhao Yanan's name on his treasured "Kill the Enemy and Perform Meritorious Service Certificate," which he held as dear as life. He said to Zhao Yanan, "I charge into battle for the people, and also to liberate myself… Comrade Zhao! I will repay you with the enemy's blood!..." This fact tells us solemnly and vividly: It is deeply moving that Chinese women are displaying the heroic characteristics of this heroic era. Isn't the great banner of Chinese women's liberation waving forward, dyed with the bloodstains of heroes? Isn't today's victory derived from the arduous struggles of the past? When I was in Beiping and saw comrades Li Landing and Jiang Nanping, who came from the battlefield to participate in the National Women's Congress, I rejoiced in the glory of our new society.

    　　　　(II)
    1942 – those were difficult years during the War of Resistance Against Japan. Along the Yangtze River, we waged guerrilla warfare, and the enemy repeatedly carried out cruel "mopping-up" operations here. In that emergency situation, a young female medical worker often led more than a dozen seriously wounded soldiers, turning back and forth in lakes and mountains, rain or shine, day or night. The enemy often sent motorboats to chase them on the water for days and nights. She carried wounded soldiers on her back, treated them, and comforted them. Sometimes on the boat, when things got tense, she simply hid the medicine kit in a grave and hid herself with the wounded soldiers in a wheat field. Sometimes, when there was no time to run, they had to close the door and calmly hide in the homes of ordinary people. The wounded soldiers were closely united around her. They were determined: "If the enemy comes, let's all die together!" But they finally got through the danger and broke through the difficulties. This young female medical worker was Li Landing. She entered the liberated area in 1941 from Shanghai, seeking light and truth; she was only a seventeen-year-old girl. But from 1942 to 1946, she spent all her time in this tense, extremely dangerous environment. Li Landing is not very strong. When I saw her, I found it hard to imagine how she could carry wounded soldiers and run under gunfire. Where did her strength come from? It was given to her by the Party. She has the spirit of never being afraid of difficulties, which is absolutely present in front of a Communist Party member. In 1944, she led several boats to transfer across the river. Suddenly, a boat sprung a leak and was about to sink. Li Landing ran into the cold, deep water without hesitation. Others followed and jumped in. They managed to save the boat, but she herself did not know that she had vomited blood due to excessive fatigue until others told her. She told me about another difficult experience:

    "In 1945 – we fought a large-scale ambush for the first time on the Gaoyou to Jiangdu highway. At that time, we collected and accommodated more than a hundred wounded soldiers from the front line. We were very busy then. The operating room was very small, with only two operating tables. I changed dressings all day long, either in the operating room or handling administrative organizational work. At this time, an unexpected emergency occurred: The enemy was coming to 'mop up.' The leadership ordered us to cross the blockade line before three o'clock at night. But we were not prepared beforehand. There were blood-soaked clothes everywhere outside the window. We quickly evacuated and transported them. At night, we reached the highway. The brigade headquarters had led the troops to jump out, but the enemy had already strictly sealed it off. Unable to cross, we had to turn back and secretly hide the wounded soldiers one by one. But the situation was very tense, because the enemy knew there was a hospital here and searched even the wheat fields. At this time, the wounded soldiers went down to the lake and were placed on fishing boats. At that time, we also contacted the scattered wounded soldiers to treat and comfort them. We often sat by the lake – we went down to the lake when the enemy chased us. The Ludang Lake is very wide. We persisted there for half a month. The brigade headquarters thought we were all sacrificed, but we finally reunited."

    In the autumn of 1946, when the Liberation Army took the initiative to withdraw from Huaibei, Li Landing bid farewell to the Yangtze River. She walked at the back of the troops to collect the wounded soldiers. In the struggle, she had developed a strong revolutionary feeling for the wounded soldiers. She said, "Wounded soldiers are like children, and all their hopes are pinned on us." For more than a month of wandering, there was no food, so they saved it for the wounded soldiers. The wounded soldiers refused to eat and gave it to the stretcher-bearers. At night, she couldn't sleep; the heavy responsibility weighed on her heart. She worried about the safety of the wounded soldiers. Aircraft strafing and days of heavy rain added to the danger. In this critical situation, she endured unparalleled fatigue and personally carried the stretcher, advancing in the mud. When she crossed a ditch, she was already dizzy and weak and could not support herself. After wading across the river, she still struggled to climb up the riverbed. At this time, she suddenly shouted, and her face immediately turned pale, and she couldn't speak. It turned out that her second rib on the left chest was broken, but she gritted her teeth and persevered. In the meantime, she skillfully mastered the technology from the flames of struggle, and from a medical worker became a medical team leader. In the war that stretched for thousands of miles, the front-line warriors affectionately called her "Nightingale" (a pun on Nightingale), and her medical team was called the "Nightingale Team." During the East China Army's southward attack and the fierce battle of Menglianggu, this rescue team completed its glorious tasks.

    　　　　(III)
    The battlefront is vast, and the flames of war are burning everywhere. We attack everywhere, and we defeat the enemy everywhere. Similarly, Jiang Nanping appeared in the East China Field Army. Jiang Nanping is a twenty-two-year-old, strongly-built female comrade. From her red face, you can tell that she is a person tempered by struggle. She is a true "female soldier." Since she participated in the front-line rescue work, her experience has been like a red flag, dazzlingly fluttering on the battlefield. Now I will only introduce one excerpt from her life: In the early years of the Liberation War, Chiang Kai-shek launched a frenzied attack on Shandong. The 1st Column of the East China Field Army was ordered to cross the Longhai Railway and detour behind the enemy, launching an attack on the enemy's heart. At this time, Jiang Nanping was a health worker in the 9th Regiment's health team. Overnight, they bravely penetrated deep into the enemy's pocket formation, directly approaching the enemy's division headquarters. The battle began fiercely at dawn. They ran around on the front lines, rescuing the wounded soldiers. At ten o'clock, the troops completed the attack task. An order came down: Withdraw immediately. The soldiers of the company came to carry the wounded soldiers – later, the soldiers of the first line completely came down, and the gunfire became louder and closer. The instructor also came down last. But there were still four or five wounded soldiers in the dressing station. At this time, the situation was extremely urgent. Jiang Nanping urgently completed the dressing tasks and immediately ran up to carry the wounded soldiers – the enemy fired grenade launchers from both wings to block the retreat. Within twenty li, artillery shells flew at them one after another. Shrapnel screamed terrifyingly over their heads, and thick smoke and dust blinded them. They broke through all dangers and rescued the wounded soldiers without wavering. But where to go? The head of the regiment's organization told them: "Go back to the original place." It was pitch black, and there were enemy strongholds all around. How could they know where the village they camped in yesterday was? At this time, they encountered seven stretchers carried by soldiers who were also lost. There were no medical personnel there. Jiang Nanping immediately gathered them around her – finally, in the vast darkness, she heard singing. They ran towards the singing and found the 7th Regiment. She hadn't eaten for a day and a night, but she first settled the wounded soldiers in the house and ran to borrow a bag of millet to cook porridge and change their dressings. Under this circumstances, she could not leave the wounded soldiers, so she guarded them. The next day, she still couldn't find her own regiment. She sent the wounded soldiers to the column's health department under the constant strafing of aircraft, traveling seventy li. She arrived at her troops around five o'clock in the afternoon. The troops had already accepted a new combat mission. She didn't want to rest at all. She was thinking about the new victory, and she immediately set off again. Jiang Nanping and two other female comrades were ordered to go to the 8th Regiment to organize a dressing station. In a fierce battle, they received more than seventy wounded soldiers. After treating these wounded soldiers, she returned to her own troops to continue working. This non-stop, intense action had lasted for six days and nights. Until that early morning when the battle was about to end, she was boiling water for the wounded soldiers in a village very close to the front line – at this time, the troops launched a storm-like attack from nearby, and enemy planes immediately strafed densely here. The sound of machine guns rang everywhere. Suddenly, a burst of fire and a row of bullets hit from the roof. She felt a shock in her arm. She touched it with her hand and saw that her hand was full of blood. She was hit. – But the plane bombing became more intense. She immediately grabbed her arm and ran out the door. After bandaging it, she looked back and saw several fires raging all around – enemy planes were still flying by, still strafing... Look, the ward was on fire, and a seriously wounded soldier was crawling out of the terrible flames. Jiang Nanping immediately threw herself into the smoke. She carried two wounded soldiers to the edge of the village one after another. At night, the troops transferred again urgently. At this time, her injured arm hurt like fire, but she ignored the pain and continued to carry the stretcher for ten li. Comrades discovered that she was injured and resolutely snatched the stretcher from her hand. She took a rifle from them and went to the destination. She carried the wounded soldiers into the ward one by one again. Immediately afterwards, she participated in the Lunan Campaign with an injured arm. After hard work and running around, the wound took two months to heal. The most difficult thing was the Lunan attack. In the wildly erupting mountain ravines, she followed the army, struggling day and night, barefoot in the mud and water. The water was often deeper than her chest. The rivers were turbulent, and it was pitch black and she couldn't see her fingers. Every one of their feet was rubbed raw, and festered. Now Jiang Nanping comes from victory, and a shining "People's Hero Medal" shines brightly on her left chest. She has just participated in the largest and fiercest Huaihai Campaign.

    　　　　(IV)
    During the twenty-odd years of the Chinese People's Liberation War, it was not only Li Landing and Jiang Nanping who appeared on the front lines, but also female heroes such as Jiang Jie, Yu Lanxiang, Song Wan, Lin Cheng, Su Hua, Ge Jingyi, Yu Yibo, Wang Tieqin, and many, many more who struggled arduously. They demonstrate that Chinese women are great and glorious in the cause of the people's liberation struggle. Li Landing and Jiang Nanping both told me: After the meeting, they want to return to their posts on the front line.

    Yes, complete victory is still ahead. We are keenly aware of the bloody hands, the hideous faces, and the violent greed of American imperialism and the Chinese reactionaries… But we, who have grown up in darkness and storms, know how to sing and advance triumphantly in the storms of victory. When I asked Li Landing, "From her medical experience, how is today's battle different from the past?" She said to me with hatred, "Go to the hospital and you will know – using the scientific weapons of American imperialism to kill people is cruel." We should remember this hatred. Fight! Great Chinese people, great Chinese women, the light of the new society is already shining on us, let us use battle to completely eliminate the enemy! Let us use battle to achieve peace!

　　火线抢救女英雄李篮丁与蒋南屏
  　全国妇女代表介绍
    刘白羽
            （一）
    在胜利光辉照耀中，我们常常想起—在人民解放战争火线上那艰苦的时日。现在让我介绍一件事实：当女医务员赵亚南给刚从昏迷中醒来的腾茂仁输血时，她坚决的拒绝，哽咽的说：“你们白天黑夜照顾得已经够好了，不应该为了我的身体去损害你们的健康！我不忍心。”经过再三安慰劝说，他把赵亚南的名字记在他珍贵如生命的“杀敌立功证”上，他对赵亚南说：“我冲锋陷阵为了人民，也为了自己翻身…赵同志！我要用敌人的血来偿还你！……”这事实多么严肃，多么鲜明的告诉我们：从中国妇女身上，表现出这一英雄时代的英雄特色是十分动人的，中国妇女解放的大旗，不就是这样染着英雄的血渍而招展前进的吗？今天的胜利，不正是从过去艰苦奋斗中得来的吗？当我在北平，看到从战场上来参加全国妇女代表大会的李篮丁、蒋南屏同志的时候我为我们新社会的光芒而喜悦。
    　　　　（二）
    一九四二年，那是抗日战争中艰难的年月，在长江沿岸，我们展开了游击战争，敌人残酷的向这里反复洗剿扫荡。在那紧急情况下，有一个年青的女医务员，经常带着十几个重伤兵，无论白天、无论风雨夜晚，在湖泊、山林中转来转去，敌人时常派出汽艇在水上追逐她们几昼夜，她背伤员、医治伤员、安慰伤员，有时在船上，紧张起来简直就把药箱藏在坟墓里，自己跟伤员一齐藏在麦田里；有时跑也来不及，只好关紧门，镇静的躲在老百姓家里，伤员们都紧紧团结在她的周围，他们下决心：“如果敌人来了，就一齐死了吧！”但是她们终于穿过危险，突破难关，这个年轻的女医务员就是李篮丁。她于一九四一年由上海追求光明、真理进入解放区，才是个十七岁的女孩子。可是从一九四二——一九四六年，她都是在这紧张危险万分的环境中度过的。李篮丁并不十分健壮，我看到她时，我很难想象她在枪林弹雨下怎样背着伤员奔走，她这力量的来源在哪里呢？是党给她的，她具有在共产党员面前绝不存在艰难畏惧的气概。一九四四年，她率领几只船渡河转移，突然船漏了，马上就要沉没，李篮丁不暇思索就跑进寒冷的深水，别人也跟着跳下去，她们才把船拯救上岸，可是她自己还不知道，别人告诉她：她由于过分劳苦而吐了血。她对我讲述另一次艰难的经历：
    “一九四五年，——我们在高邮到江都公路上、第一回打大规模伏击战，那时我们从火线上集中收容了一百多伤员，那时我们非常忙，手术房很狭小，只有两个手术台。我一天到晚换药，要不就在手术房，晚上，还要处理行政组织工作。在这时，意外的紧急情况却到来了，敌人要来扫荡，领导上命令我们夜晚三点前冲过封锁线；可是我们事前没准备，窗外到处是血衣，赶紧疏散运送，夜里我们到达公路，旅部率领部队已经跳出去，敌人却已经严密封锁起来了。过不去只好折回来，秘密的把伤员一个个隐藏起来，可是风声十分地紧张了，因为敌人知道了这里有病院，连麦田都搜索遍了，这时伤员都下了湖，安插在渔船上，那时我们还联络分散的伤员，进行治疗、安慰，我们常常坐在湖边上——敌人追到我们就下湖，绿荡湖很宽阔，我们在那里坚持了半个月，旅部以为我们全部牺牲了，可是我们最后终于会合了。”
    到四六年秋季，解放军主动的撤出淮北，李篮丁才告别了长江，她走在部队最后面收容伤员。在斗争中，她已养成对伤员浓厚的革命情感，她说：“伤员如同小孩子，一切希望都寄托在我们身上。”一个多月展转行动，没有粮食，她们节省下来给伤员吃，伤员不肯吃给了担架员；夜晚，她不能睡眠，沉重的责任压在她心上，她思索伤员的安全，飞机扫射又加上连日大雨倾盆，在这危难情况下，她就忍受着无比的疲劳，亲自抬着担架，在泥泞中前进，当她过一条河沟，她已经头晕腿软，不能支持，她涉渡河水后，依然奋力爬上河床，这时她突然喊了一声，立刻颜色苍白，讲不出话来了，原来她左胸第二条肋骨折断了，可是她咬着牙，仍然坚持下来。在这中间，她从斗争火焰中交加熟练的掌握了技术，由一个医务员而成为一个医疗队长，在千万里展转战争中，前线勇士们以无限热情管她叫“南丁”（南丁格尔的双关语），管她的医疗队叫“南丁队”，在华东军南下出击中，在孟良崮激战中，这一支救护队都完成了光荣的任务。
    　　　　（三）
    战线是辽远的，战争火焰在各处燃烧，我们向各处进击，我们在各处战胜敌人，同样，在华东野战军里就出现了蒋南屏。蒋南屏是一个二十二岁，身体结实的女同志，从她那红红的脸孔，就看出是一个斗争磨炼出来的人，她是一个真正的“女兵”，她从参加火线救护工作以来，她的经历便如一面红旗在战场上飘扬耀目，现在我只介绍她的一个片断，那就是在解放战争开始的年代，蒋介石向山东疯狂进攻，华东野战军一纵队受命跨过陇海路绕向敌后，向敌人心脏施行袭击，这时蒋南屏是九团卫生队的卫生员。一夜之间，他们插过封锁线勇敢的深入敌人袋形阵地内直迫敌人师部，战斗在黎明猛烈的开始了，她们在火线上各处奔走，抢救伤员。十点钟，部队达成袭击任务，一个命令下来：马上撤进，连队战士都跑来抬伤员，——后来，第一战线战士们完全下来了，枪声愈响愈近，指导员也最后下来了。可是包扎所里还有四、五个伤员，这时情况紧迫极了，蒋南屏紧急的完成了包扎任务立刻跑上来抬伤员——敌人从两翼发射榴弹炮来封锁退路了，二十里内，炮弹一颗紧接一颗向她们飞来，碎片恐怖的在头上嘶叫，浓烟尘土蒙蔽了她们，她们冲过一切危险，丝毫不动摇的把伤员抢救出来。可是到哪里去呢？团组织股长告诉：“回到原地。”天漆黑了，四周围都是敌人据点，又知道哪里是昨天宿营的村庄呢？这时她们又遇到由战士抬着同样迷路的七副担架，那里没有一个医务人员，蒋南屏立刻把他们聚在自己身边，——最后她在茫茫黑夜里听到歌声，她们奔向歌声找到了七团。她已经一天一夜没吃饭，可是她把伤员先安置在房子里，跑去借了一袋子小米给伤员煮粥、换药，这情况下她不能离开伤员，她就看守着他们。第二天，还是找不到自己的团师，她就把伤员在一路飞机扫射之下送给纵队卫生部，奔波七十里。下午五点钟左右才赶到自己部队，部队已经接受新的战斗任务，她一点也不想休息，她想的是新的胜利，她又立即出发。蒋南屏和其他两个女同志受命到八团组织一个包扎所，在一场激战里，她们接收了七十多个伤员，处理了这些伤员以后，她转回本部队继续工作。这样不停息的紧张行动，她已经延持了六昼夜，一直到战斗将近结束的那个清早，她在距离火线很近的一个村庄里，给伤员烧开水——这时部队从这附近暴风式的出击了，敌机立刻向这里密集扫射，到处一片机枪声响，突然一阵火光，一排子弹从屋顶上打下来，她感到手臂一震，拿手一摸一看满手是血，她挂彩了。——可是飞机轰炸更紧张了，她立刻挽着手臂奔出门外，包扎好，回头一看，四周几处火焰冲天，——敌机还在飞掠，还在扫射…看，病房燃烧了，一个重伤员正从可怕的火焰里向屋外爬，蒋南屏立刻扑向烟火里，她接连把两个伤员背到庄边上来。夜晚部队又紧急转移，这时她的伤臂痛得象火焚，她却不顾疼痛继续抬担架走了十里路，同志们发现了她负伤，坚决把担架从她手上抢去，她就从他们那里接过一支步枪到目的地，她又把伤员一个个背进病房。紧接着，她带了一只伤臂就参加了鲁南战役，劳累奔走，伤口经过两个月才封起口来。最艰苦的是鲁南出击，在狂烈暴发的山沟里，她随军展转，整日整夜，赤着脚在泥水里挣扎前进，水时常深到胸部以上，河流激荡，黑夜伸手不见五指。她们的每一只脚都磨得没有皮，溃烂了。现在蒋南屏从胜利中来，她左胸上灿烂的亮着一枚“人民英雄奖章”。她刚刚参加完规模最大、战况最烈的淮海围歼战。
    　　　　（四）
    在中国人民解放战争的二十余年间，出现在火线上的不只是李篮丁，和蒋南屏，还有如象：蒋洁、于兰香、宋琬、林成、苏华、葛井仪、俞一波、王铁芹更多更多艰苦奋斗的女英雄，她们说明：在人民解放斗争的事业里，中国妇女是伟大、是光荣的。李蓝丁、蒋南屏都告诉我：开过会想回到自己在前线的岗位上去。
    是的，彻底的胜利还在前面。我们清醒的知道美帝国主义与中国反动派——他们的血手，他们的狰狞面目，他们的狂暴贪欲，……但我们从黑暗、暴风雨中生长的人，我们是懂得怎样在胜利的暴风雨中高歌前进的。当我问李蓝丁：“从她医疗经验上看，今天和过去的战斗有何不同？”她仇恨的对我说：“你到医院去看看就知道。——用美帝国主义科学武器杀人是残酷的。”我们应该记着这仇恨。战斗吧！伟大的中国人民们，伟大的中国妇女们，新社会的光芒已经照耀着我们，让我们用战斗来彻底消灭敌人！用战斗来取得和平吧！
