　　I Want to Accuse the Kuomintang of Oppression
    To the Editor: I am a public servant at the Peiping Depot of the Northeast Transportation Bureau. This organization has now been taken over by our People's Railway Department, and we are currently waiting for job assignments. I have a matter of being oppressed and exploited during the Kuomintang era that I would like to have disclosed in the newspaper. Originally, I was a public servant at the First Work Zone of the Huludao Airport Engineering Office of the Jinzhou Railway Bureau in Northeast China. At that time, there was a commissary clerk named Guan Xiquan, who was a close relative of the Engineering Office Director Ma Baozhen. The work zone director, Liu Wenzhou, also colluded with Guan Xiquan, relying on the director's influence, he added the names of his brother-in-law, Xu Shaoen, and a man named Wang Yongfu, as two public servants. However, these two never reported for duty, but continued to receive salaries for as long as half a year. This Guan Xiquan was usually extremely rude to the public servants and general lower-level employees; of the two and four-tenths jin of rice that should have been issued daily, only one and three-tenths jin were issued to each person, and the remaining one and one-tenth jin were embezzled by him. At the end of the month, when settling accounts, he would also collect vegetable money from the employees. The workers were angry but dared not speak out. Because I questioned him, he became enraged and dismissed me outright. I had no choice but to come to Peiping and find another job. When Peiping was besieged, he fled from Northeast China to Peiping. Once I met him and asked him for the previously deducted food expenses, he only gave me forty pseudo-yuan, which was not enough to buy a pack of cigarettes. When I reasoned with him, he became enraged, cursed me in public, and injured my face and bit my hand (I have a hospital treatment certificate). At the same time, he also snatched my one qian three fen of a ring (I have a certificate from witnesses at the time, which is now on file at the police station in the First District). The next day, I went to the Eighteenth Section Police Station in the First District to report him, and the police station sent it to the First District Branch. The person in charge of the interrogation would not let me speak, allowing Guan Xiquan to deny it, and there were no results. After the People's Liberation Army entered the city, with the fair People's Government in charge, the day for me to turn over has arrived. Sir, what should I do about the money I was exploited and the medical expenses for being beaten? Should I settle accounts with him privately? Or should I file a complaint with the People's Government? Please show me the way.

    Editor's Note: Since there is both testimonial and material evidence, you can reason with Guan Xiquan to compensate for the loss. If it cannot be resolved, you can request the District People's Government to resolve it, or file a complaint with the Municipal Government.

### 我要控诉在国民党统治下　被压迫的事情

　　我要控诉在国民党统治下
    被压迫的事情
    编辑同志：我是东北运输总局北平保管处的公役，这个机关现在已经我们的人民铁道部接管了，现在我们正等待着分配工作。我有一件在国民党时期被压迫被剥削的事情，请在报纸上披露一下。原来我在东北锦州铁路局葫芦岛飞机场工程处第一工区当工役，那时有一个管伙食的庶务员关希权，他是工程处长马宝珍的至亲。工区主任刘文洲也是同关希权狼狈为奸，依仗着处长的势力，给他小舅子徐绍恩和一个叫王永福的补两个工役名字，可是这两人一直没到差，但却继续领薪水足有半年之久。这关希权平素对工役和一般下级职工们态度蛮横无比；每天应发的二斤四两大米每人只发一斤三两，下余的一斤一两就被他贪污了。到月底结伙时，还要向职工们敛取菜金。工人们都敢怒而不敢言，因为我向他提出质问，他就恼羞成怒硬将我开除了。我只好来到北平，另找职业。北平被围时，他由东北逃到北平，有一次我遇见他向他要以前扣的伙食费，他只给了我不够买一盒纸烟的四十伪金元券。我向他论理，他恼羞成怒，当众骂我，并且把我的脸打伤，手也咬伤了（有医院治疗的证明）。同时，他又把我的一钱三分一的戒指也抢去了（有当时见证人给开的证明，现在内一区警察局有存卷可查）。第二天到内一区十八段派出所告他，派出所送到内一区分局，负责问案的不让我发言，任凭关希权抵赖，没有结果。解放军入城后，有了公正的人民政府作主，到了我翻身的日子了。请问先生，我所被剥削的钱和被他欧打成伤的医药费怎么办呢？是私人向他算帐呢？还是向人民政府控诉他呢？请指我一条明路。
    编者按：既然人证物证俱在，可找关希权说理，补偿损失，如不能解决时，可提请区人民政府解决，或到市府提出控诉。
