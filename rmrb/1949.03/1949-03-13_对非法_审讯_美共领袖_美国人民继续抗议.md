Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, March 11th. TASS, New York, March 8th: On March 7th, despite the deployment of a large number of police, more than 500 people still held a patrol demonstration outside the New York Federal Court. Participants held signs condemning the "trial" of American Communist leaders and demanding that the charges against them be dropped. In court, Judge Medina unreasonably rejected the motion by the American Communist leaders' defense lawyer, Cher, to dismiss the "trial" and postpone it for ninety days.

　　对非法“审讯”美共领袖
  　美国人民继续抗议
    【新华社陕北十一日电】塔斯社纽约八日讯：三月七日，虽然有大批警察的出动，但纽约联邦法院门外仍有五百余人举行巡逻示威。参加者手执标语，谴责对美共领袖的“审讯”，并要求取消对他们的控告。在法庭上，法官麦迪纳无理地拒绝了美共领袖辩护律师彻尔取消“审讯”和将“审讯”延缓九十天的动议。
