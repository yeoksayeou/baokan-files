　　Zhao Jinshan, the Machinist
    Worker of Prosperity Branch Factory, Li Tongle
    Zhao Jinshan before liberation,
     Entered the factory to learn maintenance from a young age,
     Consistently buried himself in hard work,
     Working for over twenty years,
     Often wearing a worn-out oilskin coat,
     Eating only coarse food every meal,
     The burden at home was heavy and heavier,
     Tired all day without a smile,
     Often secretly shedding tears,
     When will the clouds disperse and the blue sky be seen?
     Zhao Jinshan after liberation,
     Greatly different compared to before,
     Life is now improved,
     Work is active and praised by everyone,
     Won an award last summer,
     Was a model worker at the end of the year.
     Now during the competition,
     Promoted to group leader to lead the team,
     And often advises people,
     I was a poor wretch,
     For half my life since childhood,
     Suffered for forty years,
     Daily work brought no good,
     Suffered humiliation all day without daring to speak,
     Now I have turned over,
     Know who saved us.
     If there were no Communist Party,
     It would be hard for the poor to turn over,
     In the past, people exploited us,
     Now we are working for ourselves.
     We must not waste a minute,
     Must not squander a single thread,
     Intensify the production of more "Shanju" cloth,
     Strive to save and reduce costs,
     Low cost and good production,
     Only then can the factory earn more money,
     We are happy when the factory earns money,
     Life will become more and more beautiful.

　　机匠赵金山
    繁荣分厂工人  李同乐
    解放前的赵金山，
     自幼入厂学保全，
     一贯埋头老实干，
     工作已有廿多年，
     经常穿着破油衣，
     每顿吃的粗糙饭，
     家中的负担重又重，
     终日累的没笑颜，
     自己常常暗落泪，
     何时云散见青天。
     解放后的赵金山，
     和前比较大相反，
     生活如今得改善，
     工作积极人人赞，
     去年夏季得过奖，
     年终评功是模范。
     今年正在竞赛时，
     又升组长来领班，
     并且经常把人劝，
     我是一个穷光蛋，
     从小到今有半辈，
     受苦受罪四十年，
     每日干活不落好，
     终日受气不敢言，
     现在我可翻了身，
     知道是谁救了咱。
     要是没有共产党，
     穷人翻身难上难，
     过去人家剥削咱，
     现在是给自己干。
     我们莫误一分钟，
     莫要糟蹋一根线，
     加紧多出山鹿布，
     努力节约减本钱，
     成本低来生产好，
     工厂才能多赚钱，
     工厂赚钱咱们喜，
     生活越改越美满。
