Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 6th. TASS Tokyo, 2nd. The Japan Times reported that a reporter interviewed Tokuda, the General Secretary of the Japanese Communist Party, regarding the statements made by Thorez and Togliatti. Tokuda stated: The Japanese Communist Party believes that striving to restore and maintain Japan's complete independence is the Japanese Communist Party's greatest task; because without independence, Japan will not be able to achieve democracy or socialism. Therefore, the Japanese Communist Party will oppose any foreign country that invades Japan. It is very clear that the Soviet Union has no intention of invading Japan. Tokuda went on to explain that Europe is now facing a life-or-death crisis, while the actual situation in Japan has not yet developed to this stage. Therefore, assuming what we should do if the Soviet Union occupies Japanese bases while pursuing its enemies, or what the US military will do, such hypothetical questions are not necessary to discuss now.

　　德田谈称
  　日共当前任务，是争取日本完全独立
    【新华社陕北六日电】塔斯社东京二日讯：日本时报称，记者曾就多列士与托格里亚蒂发表声明事访问日共总书记德田。德田称：日本共产党认为，争取恢复与维持日本的完全独立，是日共的最大任务；因为，如果没有独立，日本将不能获得民主或社会主义。因此，日本共产党将反对侵略日本的任何外国。十分清楚地，苏联毫无侵略日本的任何意图。德田继而说明欧洲现在面临着生死的危机，而日本的实际情势尚未发展到这种阶段。因此，假设苏联因追逐他的敌人而占有日本的基地，我们应该做些什么，或者美军将如何，这种假设的问题现在没有讨论的必要。
