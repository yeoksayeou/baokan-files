Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 24th. The garrison troops here have achieved good results in inspecting urban discipline. This inspection work was carried out in three steps. First, various meetings were held within the troops, using criticism and self-criticism to examine and reflect on entry-into-city discipline. Second, discipline inspection teams were formed with city and district government staff to conduct surveys and interviews among the residents of the garrison areas. Finally, mass meetings were held, where the heads of the troops made public and strict self-criticisms of certain violations of discipline within the troops, followed by explanations and apologies. Where compensation was needed, cash was immediately allocated for compensation. After this discipline inspection, various troops shattered certain cadres' and soldiers' ideas of self-importance and the one-sided erroneous notions that "the urban environment is complex," "the citizens are difficult to deal with," and "violating discipline is unavoidable." After the self-criticism, some troops also wrote guarantees and resolutions, promising to become models of urban discipline. Citizens expressed warm support for the People's Army's actions in publicly inspecting and correcting shortcomings, and presented the garrison troops with banners inscribed with phrases such as "fish and water connected" and "the army and the people are one family."

　　沈卫戍部队检查纪律
  　公开检讨缺点市民热烈拥护
    【新华社沈阳二十四日电】此间卫戍部队检查城市纪律，收获良好。这一检查工作共分三个步骤进行。首先在部队内部召开各种会议，以批评和自我批评的方式，进行入城纪律的检查与反省，其次即与市、区政府工作人员组成各种纪律检查组，在驻地市民中进行调查访问；最后便分别召开群众大会，由部队负责人对部队中某些违犯纪律的现象作了公开严格的检讨，会后并进行解释道歉，需要赔偿的即拨现款赔偿。各部队经过此次纪律检讨后，打破了某些干部及战士的居功思想与片面的以为“城市环境复杂”、“市民不好对付”、“犯纪律是免不了的”等错误观念。某些部队经过检讨后，还写了保证书与决心书，保证今后要成为遵守城市纪律的模范。市民对人民军队公开检查与纠正缺点的行动，表示热烈拥护，纷纷以“鱼水相联”、“军民一家”等锦旗赠给卫戍部队。
