To the Editor:

　　Recently, the news reported that the atmosphere in Western Europe is relatively tense. We have very little material in this regard. There are two questions, please answer:

　　1. Why is American imperialism actively preparing to form the "North Atlantic Treaty" at this time? What is its purpose? Can it be successfully organized? When did this issue arise? Which countries are participating?

　　2. Is it true that American imperialism's conspiracy to launch a criminal anti-Soviet war can achieve what it hopes for? Why have people's organizations from our Chinese liberated areas also sent representatives to participate in the World Peace Congress?

　　Answer: The "North Atlantic Treaty" plotted by American imperialists did not begin now. After the Second World War, American reactionaries began to prepare a series of conspiracies to invade the world. Before the "North Atlantic Treaty," American imperialism established air bases here and naval fortresses there. The American troops stationed in China, Greece, and other places not only did not withdraw but also attempted to use the "Marshall Plan" to control the political and economic power of Western European countries. Then, on September 2, 1947, it threatened the American countries to sign the "Inter-American Treaty." Last March 17, it instigated reactionary groups such as Britain and France to establish the "Western European Union" to realize its rule over European countries. On the 25th of last month, the "North Atlantic Treaty" was formulated in Washington. However, the "Western European Union" and the "Inter-American Treaty" are only part of the plan for the United States and Britain to establish world domination. It is an important prerequisite for implementing American policy in the world, and the proposal of the "North Atlantic Treaty" is the main tool of this policy. As the "Workers' Daily" said: "The 'North Atlantic Treaty' is a supplement to the 'Inter-American Treaty' and incorporates the countries of the 'Western European Union' into the 'American Security Zone.'" Therefore, its nature is "planned as a stage of war preparation from the diplomatic point of view by the American expansionist group." (Workers' Daily) The countries participating in the "North Atlantic Treaty" mainly include the United States, Britain, the Netherlands, Belgium, Luxembourg, Canada, and France. Now they are still carrying out vigorous diplomatic activities, trying to bring the countries of the Scandinavian Peninsula (Sweden, Norway, Denmark), Iceland, Italy, Portugal, and other countries into this aggressive alliance.

　　Why does American imperialism want to form the "North Atlantic Alliance"? The Soviet Ministry of Foreign Affairs revealed very clearly: "It is precisely aimed at the Soviet Union and the People's Democratic countries." The purpose is: "The American and British ruling groups obtain the position of manipulators in as many countries as possible, deprive these countries of the possibility of adopting independent domestic and foreign policies, and use these countries as auxiliary weapons for implementing their aggressive plans to establish American and British rule over the world." Therefore, the "North Atlantic Treaty" has become the guiding principle for the United States and Britain to establish rule in every corner of the world that can be reached.

　　But can the American and British reactionary ruling groups achieve their goals? According to the current development and growth of the world's people's democratic forces and the united efforts of the peace-loving countries headed by the Soviet Union, there is strength to prevent the realization of new war conspiracies. Stalin said well when discussing the conspiracy of war-mongers: "The result can only be the shameful failure of the new war instigators."

　　But at the same time, we must be very vigilant: this new war conspiracy of the American and British reactionaries is being intensified and will never stop on its own. All peace-loving countries and people must unite and resolutely oppose this criminal act that threatens world security and peace with practical actions. Recently, people's organizations in our Chinese liberated areas have also successively declared their opposition and sent representatives to participate in the World Peace Congress to be held in Paris, and that is the aim.

　　“北大西洋公约”是怎么回事？编辑同志：
    近来报载关于西欧空气较紧张，我们对这方面的材料很少，有两个问题，请答复：
    一、美帝国主义为什么在现时期积极筹组“北大西洋公约”？其目的何在？能否组织成功？这问题是从何时引起？有那些国家参加？
    二、美帝国主义阴谋以此发动反苏的罪恶战争，是否真能达到其所希望的呢？为啥咱中国解放区各人民团体也派代表参加拥护世界和平大会呢？

    答：美帝国主义者阴谋策划的“北大西洋公约”，并不是开始于现在。在第二次世界大战后，美国反动派就开始准备了一系列侵略世界的阴谋计划。在“北大西洋公约”以前，美帝国主义即在这里建立空军基地，在那里设海军堡垒，驻在中国、希腊等地的美军不但不撤退，还企图利用“马歇尔计划”控制西欧各国的政治、经济大权。接着它在一九四七年九月二日，威胁美洲各国签订了“泛美公约”。去年三月十七日，又策动英、法等反动集团建立“西欧联盟”，以实现她对欧洲各国的统治，在上月二十五日，在华盛顿制订了“北大西洋公约”，但“西欧联盟”以及“泛美公约”只是美英建立世界统治计划中的一个计划，是在全世界推行美国政策的重要前提，而“北大西洋公约”之提出，则作为这一政策的主要工具，正如“劳动报”所说：“‘北大西洋公约’是‘泛美公约’的补充，是把‘西欧联盟’各国纳入‘美国安全区’”。所以它的性质就是“作为美国扩张主义集团从外交上作战争准备的一个阶段而计划的。”（劳动报）参加“北大西洋公约”的国家主要有美、英、荷、比、卢、加、法七国，现仍大肆进行外交活动，想把斯堪的那维亚半岛的国家（瑞典、挪威、丹麦）、冰岛、意大利、葡萄牙等国也拉进这个侵略联盟。
    为什么美帝国主义要筹组“北大西洋联盟”呢？苏联外交部揭露的很明确：“正是针对苏联与人民民主国家的”。目的就是：“美英统治集团在尽可能多的国家中获得操纵者的地位，剥夺这些国家采取独立的内政、外交政策的可能性，利用这些国家作为实施他们建立美、英对世界统治的侵略计划的辅助武器。”因此，“北大西洋公约”业已成为美英在世界每一个能够达到的角落建立统治的计划的指导方针。
    但美英反动统治集团是不是能达到他们的目的呢？根据目前世界人民民主力量的发展和壮大，和在以苏联为首的和平国家人民的团结努力，是有力量阻止新战争阴谋的实现。斯大林论战争贩子的阴谋时说得好：“其结果只能是新战争鼓吹者的可耻的失败”。
    但同时我们必须十分警觉：美英反动派这一新战争阴谋正在加紧进行，绝不会自行停止。对这种威胁世界安全和平的罪恶行为，必须一切爱好和平的国家和人民团结起来，用实际行动坚决予以反对，最近咱们中国解放区各人民团体也纷纷宣言反对，并选派代表参加巴黎行将举行的拥护世界和平大会，其目的就在于此。
