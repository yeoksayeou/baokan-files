    Vasilevsky
    The new Minister of the Soviet Armed Forces, Vasilevsky, is one of the most organizationally talented generals in the Soviet Red Army. He is fifty-one years old this year and was born in a Cossack village in the Don region. During World War I, he was conscripted into a Cossack cavalry regiment. After the war ended, he returned to his hometown and resolutely joined the Red Army. During the Soviet-Finnish War from November 1939 to March 1940, he and General Zhukov commanded the offensive against the "Mannerheim Line," which began to reveal his military organizational genius. After the outbreak of the Soviet-German War, he remained with General Zhukov, commanding the defense of Moscow and the subsequent first winter counteroffensive. The Voronezh offensive on the upper Don River, organized by him and General Zhukov, was a globally sensational campaign. It not only prevented the German army from rescuing the encircled troops in Stalingrad, but also fundamentally shook the German army's southern front. After this campaign, he was awarded the rank of Marshal, and at the end of 1943, he replaced the aging Shaposhnikov as Chief of Staff of the Voronezh Front garrison, and served as the frontline representative of the Soviet Supreme Command. Later, he directly commanded the troops of the Third Belorussian Front. After the defeat of the German army and the Soviet Union declared war on Japan, he was sent to the Far East to command the Red Army in the war against Japan, and in a few days, he completely crushed the entire Kwantung Army of Japanese imperialism.
    Polish National Council
    In 1943, while the Polish People's Guerrillas were fighting hard against the German invaders and the former Polish reactionary government had fled to Britain, the Polish Workers' Party (Communist Party), Socialist Party, Peasant Party, Democratic Party, etc., held a secret meeting in Warsaw attended by thirty representatives. At this meeting, the Polish National Council was established, and a "Political Action Program" was adopted. At that time, the National Council was the supreme body for unified leadership of the Polish people's war of resistance. In the autumn of 1944, after the Soviet Red Army drove the German invaders out of Polish territory, the National Council decided to organize the Committee of National Liberation, announced the implementation of democratic politics, carried out land reform, and punished the fascist elements. Subsequently, the Polish people demanded that the Liberation Committee be reorganized into a People's Democratic Government. The current Polish National Council was formally elected by the people of the entire country on January 19, 1947. The former Speaker of the Council, Bolesław Bierut (Workers' Party), was awarded the title of President. The new Speaker is Kowalski, a veteran of the Peasant Party, and one of the Vice-Speakers is Gomółka of the Workers' Party.
