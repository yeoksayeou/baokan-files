    [Our Newspaper] The Third Day of the First National Congress of Chinese Women (26th) continued at Huairen Hall in Zhongnanhai. Four hundred and forty-one delegates attended, with one hundred and sixty-three observers and guests. The meeting proceeded in a warm and pleasant atmosphere. The meeting opened at 9:30 a.m., chaired by Xu Guangping. Comrade Deng Yingchao delivered a report on "The Guiding Principles and Tasks of the Chinese Women's Movement" (see separate article). Following this, Comrade Deng Yingchao proposed the establishment of a general leading body for the national democratic women's movement—the All-China Democratic Women's Federation—to adapt to the development of the national revolutionary victory and the needs of the women's movement. The meeting continued at 2:00 p.m., chaired by Comrade Zhang Quanbao. Comrade Deng Yingchao continued her report, which lasted for four hours. Afterwards, Mrs. Feng, Li Dequan, delivered a report on the "Democratic Women's Movement in the Kuomintang-Controlled Areas." She cited numerous facts to illustrate the tragic oppression suffered by women of all classes in the Kuomintang-controlled areas, as well as the heroic struggles of female workers, female students, and professional women against hunger and persecution.
    Finally, Qian Zhengying, on behalf of the Political Department of the Fourth Field Army of the People's Liberation Army, the Hungarian Women's Democratic League, and the Central Committee of the Mongolian Working Women, read out three congratulatory telegrams to the congress. The meeting adjourned at 5:00 p.m.
    [Another dispatch] The congress will recess for one day today (27th), during which each delegation will hold group discussions on the reports given by Comrade Deng Yingchao and Mrs. Feng, Li Dequan, at the congress.
