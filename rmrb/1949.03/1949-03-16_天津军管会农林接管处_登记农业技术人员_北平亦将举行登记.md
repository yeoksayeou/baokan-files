　　Tianjin Military Control Commission's Agriculture and Forestry Takeover Department
  　Registers Agricultural Technicians
    Registration to be Held in Beiping as Well
    [Report from this newspaper] In order to absorb and transform various agricultural technical personnel for the cause of people's construction, the North China People's Government's Ministry of Agriculture plans to conduct a registration of various agricultural technical personnel. In Tianjin, the Agriculture and Forestry Takeover Department of the Tianjin Military Control Commission has already registered more than 240 people. On the 26th of last month, the Deputy Minister of Agriculture personally came to Tianjin to convene these registered technical personnel to report on the North China region's agricultural construction policies and plans for this year, introduce the situation in the liberated areas, and call on technical personnel to serve the people. After two days of group discussions and individual talks, the first batch of more than 80 agricultural technical personnel who have been assigned to work in various places will depart within days. Water conservancy technical personnel are also being consulted individually regarding their opinions. In Beiping, since the liberation, those who have come to the government to request registration have been continuous. In order to widely absorb talents from all aspects, the Agriculture, Forestry and Water Conservancy Takeover Department of the Beiping Military Control Commission has also decided to hold a registration of technical personnel. All those with agricultural technology, water conservancy, and veterinary expertise who are currently unemployed can go to the designated location to register. Those who wish to go to various places to work can be assigned immediately. Because the People's Government values the people's construction cause and values various specialized technical talents, unemployed technical personnel are the first to obtain work. Therefore, many young people have requested to study technology.

　　天津军管会农林接管处
  　登记农业技术人员
    北平亦将举行登记
    【本报讯】华北人民政府农业部为了吸收与改造各种农业技术人材从事人民建设事业，拟进行各种农业技术人员登记。在天津者，已由天津军管会农林接管处登记二百四十余人。上月二十六日，农业部副部长曾亲到天津召集此项已登记之技术人员，报告本年华北区农业建设方针及计划，介绍解放区情形，号召技术人员为人民服务。经过两天小组讨论及个别谈话，已分配各地工作之第一批农业技术人员有八十余人，即将于日内出发。水利技术人员，亦正在分别征求本人意见中。北平方面，自解放以来，到政府要求登记者亦络绎不绝。为了广泛吸收各方面人材，北平军管会农林水利接管处亦决定举行技术人员登记。举凡具有农业技术、水利、兽医专长，尚无职业者，均可到指定地点进行登记。如愿赴各地工作，即可立即分配。由于人民政府重视人民建设事业，重视各种专门技术人材，失业技术人员首先得到工作。因此已有不少青年要求学习技术。
