　　Shijingshan Power Plant
  　Over Two Hundred Kuomintang Personnel Register for a New Start
    [Our Dispatch] During the Kuomintang's rule of the Shijingshan Power Plant, they employed despicable and shameless methods such as bribery, exploitation, threats, and terror to coerce employees and workers into joining the Kuomintang, the "Anti-Communist Vanguard," and the Three Youth Principles League, attempting to achieve their goal of controlling the workers and conducting anti-communist and anti-people activities. After the plant was liberated on December 17th of last year, the People's Government, in order to save the deceived workers, immediately called on them to register voluntarily, break away from the Kuomintang reactionary organization, and return to the ranks of the proletariat. At the same time, widespread propaganda and education were carried out. Initially, due to insufficient understanding of the policies of the Communist Party and the People's Government, coupled with rumors spread secretly by a few bad elements, there was a period of panic. They feared that their jobs would not be guaranteed after registration and doubted whether the People's Government was truly lenient. In light of this situation, the work team first conducted widespread propaganda on the current situation and explained the lenient policy. They also conducted class education for the workers and implemented certain controls over a few key Kuomintang figures. As a result, the majority of employees who were forced to join the Kuomintang became clear-minded. Not only did they enthusiastically register voluntarily, but they also revealed things they had not dared to say in the past; and they held a "Return to the Ranks" meeting, with very high morale. They felt infinite warmth in returning to the proletarian ranks. This work, which began on January 22nd and ended on March 6th, saw a total of 270 Kuomintang members, "Anti-Communist Vanguard" members, and others register.
    To further enhance the political consciousness of employees and unite production, the plant has formulated a specific plan: (1) Continue to call on unregistered Kuomintang members and members of the Three Youth Principles League to register. As long as they sincerely confess and repent, the People's Government will still grant them leniency. (2) Continue to strengthen class education to enhance workers' political awareness and enthusiasm for production. (3) For a few key Kuomintang figures, punishment will be meted out separately based on the specific circumstances of their past wrongdoings.

　　石景山发电厂
  　二百余国民党人员登记自新
    【本报讯】国民党统治石景山发电厂时，曾采取了收买利用、威胁恐怖等等欺骗无耻手段，强迫职员、工人参加国民党、“清共先锋队”、三青团，妄图达到它统治工人、进行反共反人民的目的。该厂于去年十二月十七日解放后，人民政府为了挽救受骗的工人，即号召他们自动登记，脱离国民党反动组织，回到无产阶级的本队来，同时进行普遍的宣传教育。开始时，他们由于对共产党和人民政府的政策了解不够，加上少数坏分子暗地造谣，曾经一度发生恐慌，怕登记后职业无保障，怀疑人民政府是否真宽大。根据此种情况，工作组首先普遍进行了目前形势的宣传，讲解宽大政策。对工友又进行了阶级教育，对少数国民党首要分子施行了一定的控制。这样一来，大多数被迫参加国民党的职工心里明亮了，不但踊跃自动的来登记，而且把过去不敢说的事都说了出来；并召开了“归队”大会，情绪非常高涨。他们感到回到无产阶级队伍里有无限的温暖。这一工作自一月二十二号起至三月六号止，参加登记的国民党员、“清共先锋队员”等共二百七十名。
    为进一步提高职工政治觉悟，团结生产，该厂特订出具体计划：（一）继续号召没登记的国民党员、三青团员进行登记，只要诚心坦白悔过，人民政府仍予以宽大。（二）继续加强阶级教育，提高工人政治觉悟与生产热忱。（三）对少数国民党首要分子，根据其过去作恶轻重的具体情况，分别予以惩办。
