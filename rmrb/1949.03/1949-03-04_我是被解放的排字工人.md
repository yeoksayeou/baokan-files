　　I am a Liberated Typesetter
　　New Tangshan Daily, Ai Wen
　　Struggling in the dark society of the Kuomintang reactionaries, I only experienced oppression, contempt, being treated like a beast of burden, and living an inhuman life. My father mined coal in a drill well, and his monthly earnings were not even enough to eat, let alone afford schooling for his children.

　　When I was thirteen years old and graduated from elementary school, I saw the rich young masters and ladies continuing on to middle school, and I envied them, asking my father several times to let me go to school. At that time, my father said to me with tears in his eyes: "Look at the rich people, they can go to middle school, they are all young masters and ladies. Your father earns money by selling his blood and sweat, and even eating is a problem, let alone going to middle school! Besides, we don't have the ability to ask for favors, and we can't get into school either!" From then on, I couldn't go to school and picked up coal at home to help maintain our livelihood.

　　One winter, my father injured his back in the well. Several of his fellow workers carried him to the mine's hospital. The doctors, seeing the black coal and blood on my father's body, frowned in disgust and unhappily tapped my father's back with a large iron instrument. My father immediately cried out in a sweat. When I saw the doctor's cruel treatment of the worker, I was very angry, and I wondered if every corner of this world was so cruel and miserable? Should a doctor treat workers so inhumanely? My father stayed in the hospital for a whole month, and I had to walk a long way to the hospital every day to bring my father food. Writing this, I remember two things that happened during that month: One day, I was walking on the road with food in my hand, and a bicycle came rushing from behind, ridden by a Chiang soldier who was humming a tune and swaggering. I was afraid he would run me over, so I dodged him, but he deliberately bumped into me. I was knocked down by him, and the food I was bringing to my father was spilled on the ground. Not only did he not apologize to me, but he unreasonably slapped me a few times, glared at me, and said, "Why are you walking into the road, don't you have eyes?" Who dared to move against Chiang Kai-shek's army? I had no choice but to cry and go home. On the way, I thought, "Why is the Kuomintang army unreasonable and only bullies the people? Aren't they Chinese?"

　　After my father was discharged from the hospital, he sent me to work as a typesetter at the pseudo-Tangshan Daily. As an apprentice, I didn't get paid, and I ate two cornbread meals a day. However, the directors, presidents, managers... and other officials of the pseudo-newspaper lived such privileged lives. What I remember most clearly is: One day, the newspaper office was cleaned very neatly and tidied up very beautifully. I thought it was strange, what day is it today? After a while, a car came to the door, and it was said that some Kuomintang director-general came to inspect the newspaper office. Alas! This was no small matter. A large group of people stood at the door to greet him, accompanying the committee member before, after, and on both sides. They also asked me to buy a box of the best cigarettes and poured a bowl of fragrant tea. At that time, we were gnawing on cornbread, and they saw us, one by one, pale and emaciated, and smiled, sighed, and then covered their big mouths with a handkerchief. Later, he said that the air in our room was bad and quickly retreated. At noon, a burst of finger-guessing games came from the president's room: "Two good... eight horses!" I secretly peeked through the crack in the door and saw a group of people in suits surrounding and drinking. But when I thought of the cornbread, I could only shed tears secretly.

　　I used to hear people talk about the Eighth Route Army. I heard that the Eighth Route Army was an army that turned oppressed laborers into masters, an army of the proletariat, and an army that loved and served the people. I heard that anyone could go to school in the liberated areas. At that time, I just silently hoped, hoping that the Kuomintang reactionaries would be driven away quickly and the People's Liberation Army would liberate Tangshan as soon as possible, but this was just a hope I dared not speak out.

　　Now, I really like it, Tangshan is really liberated! I have really seen the light! On December 12th, the Chiang bandits secretly rolled out of Tangshan, and then the People's Liberation Army entered the city. The comrades talked to me kindly: "Little brother, do a good job! We must serve the people! Now is the world of the working people." I am really excited. I must serve the people well. The future of the working people will always be bright, and our country will be able to grow healthily this time and establish a new democratic China.

　　我是被解放的排字工人
    新唐山日报  艾纹
    在国民党反动派的黑暗社会里挣扎着，只有被压迫，被轻视，作牛马，过着非人的生活。父亲在钻井下挖煤，每月挣钱还不够吃饭，不要说供自己的孩子念书了。
    十三岁那年我小学毕业了，看到人家有钱的少爷小姐们继续上中学，使我羡慕的几次要求父亲让我到学校里去。那时，父亲落着眼泪对我说：“你看有钱人能上中学呢，他们都是些少爷小姐，你爸爸出卖血汗换钱的，吃饭都成问题，还说啥上中学呢！再说咱们没有能力托人情，也不能考进学校呀！”从此我就不能上学了，在家里拾点煤来帮助维持生活。
    一个冬天，父亲在井下把腰砸伤了，父亲被厂里的几个工友们抬到矿方的医院里去，那些医生看见父亲身上的黑煤和血污，嫌太脏，皱着眉头，十分不愉快的用一个很大的铁器在父亲的背上敲了敲，父亲马上直流大汗地叫起来。当时我见到这个医生对待工人的惨状，使我非常愤怒，于是我想这世界上每一个角落难道都是这样的残酷悲惨吗？一个医生就应当这样不人道的对待工人吗？父亲入院整整的住了一个月，我每天要跑很远的路到医院给父亲送饭。写到这里，我又想起在那一个月期间的二件事：一天，我正拿着饭在马路上走，从后面急促的奔来一辆自行车，上面骑着一个口里哼着小调吊儿浪当的蒋军。我怕他轧着我就躲开他，可是他偏偏的往我身上撞，我被他碰倒了，给父亲送的饭也都撒在地上了，他不但不向我道歉，反而无理的打了我几个耳光，瞪着眼睛说：“为什么往车子上走，没有眼睛吗？”蒋介石的军队，老百姓谁敢动，我只得哭着走回家去。我在路上想：“为什么国民党军不讲理，专会欺侮人民呢？他们难道不是中国人吗？”
    父亲出院以后，把我送到伪唐山日报馆里排字，当学徒不给钱，每天啃两顿窝窝头，可是伪报馆里什么主任、社长、经理……等等的官儿们的生活待遇都是那样的优越，我记忆最深刻的，就是：有一天，报馆里打扫的很干净，整理得很漂亮，我觉得很奇怪，今天是啥日子啦？隔了一会，门口来了一辆小汽车，车上坐的听说是什么国民党主任委员来视察报馆，唉呀！这可是了不得，一大群人站在门口迎接着，陪在那个什么委员的前后左右，还叫我买来一盒项好的纸烟，倒了一碗香茶。那时，我们在啃窝窝头，他们看见我们一个个面黄饥瘦，微笑着叹了一口气，随后就用手帕把那大嘴堵住了，后来他说我们屋里空气不好，就赶快的退出去了。到响午便从社长的屋子里传出了一片划拳声：“二好…八匹马呀…”我偷偷地在门缝里望了望，一群穿西服的团团围住喝上了。可是我想起窝窝头来只好暗暗的落泪。
    从前我听人说过八路军，听说八路军是使受压迫的劳动人们翻身的军队，是无产阶级的军队，是爱护人民为人民服务的军队。听说解放区里的学校是任何人都能进去的。那时我只默默的在盼望，盼望着把国民党反动派快赶走，解放军早日来解放唐山，可是这只是不敢说出的希望。
    现在，真喜欢，唐山真的解放了！我真的见到了光明！在十二月十二日那天，蒋匪偷偷的从唐山滚出去了，接着解放军就入了城，同志们和蔼的和我谈话：“小兄弟好好的搞下去吧！我们要为人民服务才对！现在是劳动人民的天下了。”我真兴奋，我一定好好为人民服务，劳动人民的前途永远是光明的，我们的国家这回才能健全的成长，建立一个新民主主义的新中国。
