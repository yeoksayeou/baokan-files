Xinhua News Agency, Beiping, 27th -- Beiping Military Control Commission's takeover of the assets of the Beiping Office of the U.S. Aid Utilization Committee of the Kuomintang Government's Executive Yuan. On the 18th of this month, the Beiping Military Control Commission sent personnel to take over 6,666 bags of flour stored at the Beiping Office of the U.S. Aid Utilization Committee of the Kuomintang Government's Executive Yuan. The following day, Davis, the former representative of the U.S. Economic Cooperation Administration to North China, published a so-called protest letter to General Ye Jianying in the Beiping press, "protesting" the takeover. This reporter inquired with relevant parties about the details of the matter, as follows: When the Military Control Commission sent personnel to take over the Beiping Office of the U.S. Aid Utilization Committee of the Kuomintang Government's Executive Yuan, it was found that the material inventory list of the office showed a balance of 6,641 bags of U.S. flour, 21 bags of local flour, and 4 large bags of U.S. flour, stored in the warehouse at 42 Dongjiaominxiang. Furthermore, the office's archives contained a reply to the Tianjin Office of the U.S. Aid Utilization Committee of the Kuomintang Government's Executive Yuan, letter number Jinzi 75, regarding the last received shipment of 70,720 bags of flour. All of the above documents were stamped with the seal of Li Fujing, the director of the Beiping Office. The office also had records of the distribution and allocation of these 70,720 bags of flour. Therefore, on the 18th of this month, the Beiping Military Control Commission sent personnel to take over the remaining flour from the office. The office director, Li Fujing, personally supervised the coolies to move the flour out of the warehouse and hand it over to the representatives of the Military Control Commission. The aforementioned documents and facts prove that the flour belonged to the Beiping Office of the U.S. Aid Utilization Committee of the Kuomintang Government's Executive Yuan. Therefore, the dispatch of personnel by the Beiping Military Control Commission to take over the flour is purely a matter of the Chinese People's Liberation Army taking over the assets of the reactionary Chinese Kuomintang government, and has nothing to do with the China branch of the U.S. Economic Cooperation Administration.

　　北平军管会接收伪行政院美援资产
    【新华社北平二十七日电】北平军管会接收国民党政府行政院美援运用委员会北平办事处资产经过。本月十八日，北平市军事管制委员会曾派员接收国民党政府行政院美援运用委员会北平办事处所存面粉六千六百六十六袋。次日，有前美国经济合作总署驻华北代表戴维斯，向北平报界发表其致叶剑英将军所谓抗议信一件，“抗议”该项接收。本社记者为此向有关方面探悉此事之经过如下：军管会在派员接收国民党政府美援运用委员会北平办事处时，查明该办事处移交清册之物资表中，有结存美存美国面粉六千六百四十一袋，本地面粉二十一袋，大袋美国面粉四袋，存于东交民巷四十二号内的库房内。又查该办事处档案，内有关于其最后收到之面粉七万零七百二十袋，致国民党政府行政院美援运用委员会天津办事处津字第七五号之复函。上述文件均盖有该北平办事处处长李福景之图章。该办事处对此七万零七百二十袋面粉之历次配售与拨付，亦均有单据表册可查。因此，本月十八日，本市军管会乃派员向该办事处接收剩余之面粉，当由该办事处处长李福景亲自督促脚夫搬出库房，点交军管会代表。上述文件及事实均证明，该项面粉，属于中国国民党政府行政院美援运用委员会北平办事处所有，故北平市军管会之派员接收，纯属中国人民解放军接收中国国民党反动政府之资产的问题，与美国经济合作总署中国分署毫无关涉。
