　　Yuan Dynasty Peanut Planting Area Will Exceed the County Government's Original Plan
    [Jinan News] Yuan Dynasty broke through the masses' ideological concerns about planting peanuts. With Party members as the backbone, they launched mutual lending among farmers, expanding the county government's original planting plan area of 140,000 mu by 33 percent, reaching 210,000 mu. In Wuchengji, the Third District, the Party member meeting corrected the superstitious ideas and ideological concerns of some Party members. For example, Party member Yin Zhandong proposed: 1. Planting peanuts cannot interfere with the two-season crops. 2. This year has an intercalary July, and ten dragons govern the water: the first half of the year is dry, and the second half is flooded, so planting peanuts is not good. 3. Lack of manure. After research and discussion, everyone agreed that planting seedlings yields an early harvest and can catch up with the two seasons; the ten dragons governing the water is a lie, and historical proof was found; the lack of manure can be compensated by picking up more, fortunately there are still forty or fifty days before planting peanuts. Other Party members also recognized the benefits of planting peanuts in the discussion, and planted an additional twenty-six mu. This not only resolved the ideological concerns of Party members, but also learned the method of guiding the masses in formulating plans. Wuchengji originally planned to plant peanuts on 25 percent of the village's total cultivated land, but through the leadership and mobilization of Party members, it reached 45 percent. In order to solve the difficulty of seeds, lending and mutual assistance were launched. Initially, many people were worried that "lending money is exploitation." After extensive policy publicity, with Party members taking the lead in carrying out lending, farmers also began to lend to each other. For example, in Qianshalu, the Fourth District, the grain lent by Party members alone solved the difficulties of thirty-two households without seeds. Xingcun Village in the Third District could only plant 26 percent of the village's cultivated land area before lending was launched, but reached 30 percent after lending was launched.

　　元朝花生播种面积将超过县府原计划
    【冀南讯】元朝打破群众种花生的思想顾虑，以党员为骨干，开展了农民之间的互相借贷，扩大了县府原播种计划面积十四万亩的百分之三十三，将达二十一万亩。三区武城集在党员会议上，纠正了某些党员的迷信观念和思想顾虑，如党员尹占东提出：一、种花生不能赶两季庄稼。二、今年润七月，十龙治水：上半年旱，下半年涝，种花生不好。三、粪缺。经过研究讨论，大家一致认为：种立秧的收的早，可赶两季；十龙治水是骗人的，并从历史上找到了证明；粪缺可多拾，好在离种花生还有四五十天工夫。其他党员在讨论中也认识到种花生的好处，共多种了二十六亩。这样一方面解决了党员的思想顾虑，而又学会了领导群众订计划的方法。武城集原订计划是种全村总耕地的百分之二十五的花生，经党员带头和动员达到了百分之四十五。为了解决种籽困难，又开展了借贷互助。最初，不少群众有“放帐是剥削”的顾虑，经广泛进行了政策宣传，以党员带头开展借贷后，农民之间也开始借贷起来了。如四区前沙路，仅党员借出的粮食，便解决了三十二户没种籽的困难。三区邢町村，未开展借贷前，只能种到全村耕地面积的百分之二十六，开展借贷后，达到百分之三十。
