　　People Can Sue Pseudo-Bureaucrats for Corruption and Wrongdoing According to Law
　　Editor:
　　Since the liberation of Beiping, I have not seen any announcements in the newspapers regarding the handling of pseudo-bureaucrats who are corrupt and commit wrongdoing. I don't know if they can be prosecuted? Which agency should I go to to sue them? Please tell me the name and address of the agency.
　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　Citizen Wang Yongnian

　　Mr. Wang Yongnian:
　　If there is indeed evidence of pseudo-bureaucrats being corrupt and committing wrongdoing, the People's Government will of course be responsible for handling it according to law. If you want to sue, it is best to first find the work group in your district, and then, depending on the severity of the circumstances, be introduced to the public security or judicial organs for resolution. You can also directly go to the Public Security Bureau and the court to file a complaint.

　　Applying for the Arts Cadre Training Class
　　Requires a Referral from a Government Above the District Level
　　Yuan Huasheng:
　　(1) To apply for the Arts Cadre Training Class, you must have a letter of introduction from a government above the district level.
　　(2) After completing your studies and starting work in the future, those who are not assigned to the army will generally be on a salary system.

　　Shao Jikang Bookstore Problem
　　Can be Reported to the Government for Resolution
　　Mr. Shao Jikang:
　　The People's Government protects private industrial and commercial enterprises that are beneficial to the national economy and the people's livelihood. If your bookstore has no other problems besides a misunderstanding, the government will definitely resolve it appropriately. Because this issue is directly handled by the Northeast Bookstore, it is best to continue to negotiate directly with the Northeast Bookstore. If the Northeast Bookstore cannot resolve it, then report it to the local municipal government for handling.

　　Youth League Members Joining the Army
　　Should Bring Their Organizational Ties With Them
　　Comrade Liu Pingze:
　　After joining the army, Youth League members can bring their organizational ties with them to the army, and will still be Youth League members, and can continue to participate in the League's organizational life.
　　According to the CCP Central Committee's resolution on building the League, the League can be built in the army.

　　伪官僚贪污作恶人民可以依法控诉编者先生：
    自北平解放之后，未曾见过报纸公布征办伪官僚贪污作恶的处理办法，不知道能否征办？到什么机关控诉他们？请告机关之名称及住址。
    　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　市民　王永年王永年先生：
    伪官僚贪污作恶，如确有证据，人民政府当然要负责依法处理。如要控诉最好先找所在区工作组，然后分别情节轻重介绍到公安或司法机关解决。愿直接找公安局和法院控诉也可以。

    投考艺术干训班
    区以上政府介绍袁华生生：
    （一）投考艺术干部训练班，须有区以上政府介绍信方可。
    （二）将来学习完毕参加工作，除分配到军队者外，一般的都是薪金制。
    邵继康书店问题
    可呈报政府解决邵继康先生：
    人民政府对有益于国计民生的私人工商业是保护的。你的书店如果仅仅是因为误会而无其他问题，政府一定会适当解决。因为这个问题是东北书店直接处理的，现在你最好仍与东北书店直接交涉，如东北书店无法解决，再呈报当地市政府处理。
    青年团员参军
    应将组织关系带上刘平泽同志：
    青年团员参军后，可将其组织关系带到部队里去，仍然是青年团员，并可继续参加团的组织生活。
    按照中共中央建团的决议，部队中可以建团。
