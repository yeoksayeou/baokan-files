"Jidian" Beiping Branch
    Employees Voluntarily Work Overtime to Collect Outstanding Electricity Fees
    [Reported by this newspaper] Since the Military Control Commission took over the Beiping Branch of Jibei Electric Power Company, employees have been working actively and diligently, greatly improving the power supply situation, and the business has also greatly developed. In the past, because there were many special people and special institutions, a lot of the electricity fees that should have been collected could not be. Collectors were scolded and beaten frequently. Shortly after liberation, the situation completely changed. Recently, through the efforts of all the collectors, most of the electricity fees that could not be collected in the past have been recovered in less than a month. Now, all employees have voluntarily initiated a competition, and they don't even rest on Sundays. Jin Liankui, Zhang Zhenguo, Zhao Guxun, Fang Puxiang, Liu Zhifang and other five workers from the internal wiring team, came back from work in Dongzhimen and other places, and without even eating, they automatically helped with other work. Within seven days, they processed two thousand reinstatement requests. The accounting section has to rush to do two months' worth of work in one month because the new electricity price for March was approved. Staff from the business section of the head office are also participating in assisting with the accounting. This has never happened before in the electric power company.

　　“冀电”北平分公司
    职工自动加工收清积欠电费
    【本报讯】冀北电力公司北平分公司自军管会接管以后，职工积极努力，大大改进了供电状况，业务上也有很大发展。过去因为有许多特殊人物与特殊机关，应收的电费很多收不到。收费员受骂挨打的事，层出不穷。解放后不久，情形就完全改变了。近经全体收费员努力，不到一个月就把过去无法收到的电费，大部收回。现全体职工自动发起竞赛，礼拜天也不休息。内线股工人金连奎、张振国、赵古勋、方普祥、刘志方等五人，从东直门等处工作回来，饭也没有吃，就自动帮忙别的工作。七天内处理了两千件的复电工作。核算股因为三月份新的电价核定下来，一个月要赶两个月的活。总公司业务课的职员也参加协助核算。这是电力公司历来没有的事。
