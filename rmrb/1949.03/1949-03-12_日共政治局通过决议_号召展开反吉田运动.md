Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 10th. TASS, Tokyo, 6th: The Politburo of the Japanese Communist Party has passed a resolution calling on the broad masses of working people to launch a movement to overthrow the Yoshida Cabinet. The resolution states: The cabinet formed by the Democratic Liberal Party is a government supported by capitalists who are colluding with or attempting to merge with foreign capital. This government, exercising its power based on bureaucratic rule, is handing over all financial resources, materials, and labor power to the exclusive control of monopoly capitalists, infringing on the interests of small employers and small farmers, and turning working people into slaves. This cabinet, which is doing everything possible to intensify the oppression of the people, is now clearly moving towards fascism. Therefore, the current struggles of the Japanese people must coordinate with each other and aim at overthrowing the monopoly capitalists who sell out national interests and their government—the Yoshida Cabinet. Struggle must be waged against all reactionary acts of plunder resulting from attracting foreign investment, and against measures such as intensifying labor, low wages, depriving civil servants of the right to strike, and revising labor legislation. It is necessary to oppose unequal foreign trade that threatens national independence. Secondly, the struggle against the huge national budget that sacrifices the interests of the people must be carried out. In addition, the early conclusion of a peace treaty must be promoted. This struggle against the ruling clique can only succeed if the people gain political power. The interests of the struggle require the unconditional unity of the worker-peasant alliance and the establishment of a nationwide democratic united front. The resolution of the Politburo of the Japanese Communist Party emphatically points out: Raising the ideological level of party members, arming them with Marxism-Leninism, and the unity of theory and practice are currently urgent needs.

　　日共政治局通过决议
  　号召展开反吉田运动
    【新华社陕北十日电】塔斯社东京六日讯：日本共产党政治局通过决议，号召劳动人民大众发动推翻吉田内阁的运动。该决议称：民主自由党所组成的内阁，是与外国资本勾结或力图与外国资本合并的资本家所支持的政府。依据官僚统治行使其权力的这个政府，正将一切财政、物资与劳动力都交给独占资本家一手支配，侵犯小雇主与小农的利益，并变劳动人民为奴隶。这个千方百计加紧压迫人民的内阁，目前显然正走向法西斯主义。因此，目前日本人民的斗争必须互相配合，并以推翻出卖国家利益的独占资本家及其政府——吉田内阁为目标。必须进行斗争，以反对由于吸引外国投资而产生的一切反动的掠夺行为，并反对加强劳动强度、低微工资、剥夺公务员罢工权利及修改劳工立法等措施。必须反对威胁着国家独立的不平等的对外贸易。其次，必须进行反对牺牲人民利益的庞大的国家预算的斗争。此外，必须促进及早缔结和约。这个反对统治集团的斗争只有由人民获得政权才能成功。斗争的利益要求工农阵线的无条件团结，以及建立全国范围的民主统一战线。日共政治局决议着重指出：提高党员的思想水平，以马列主义武装他们以及理论与实践的统一，是目前迫切需要的事情。
