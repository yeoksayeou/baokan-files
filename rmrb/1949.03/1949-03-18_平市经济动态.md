　　Economic Dynamics in Beiping City
  Slight Increase in Wheat and Red Sorghum Prices; Millet Shows Outflow Phenomenon
　　Yesterday's grain prices in Beiping City remained stable overall, with only slight increases in wheat and red sorghum. The reason is that several flour mills in the city (such as Sanyuangong, Fuxing, etc.) need to purchase more than 10,000 jin of wheat from the market every day. Recently, red sorghum and millet have slightly trended upwards, due to some speculative merchants purchasing them and transporting them outside the city for sale.

　　　　Sugar Market Weak, Salt Slightly Up
　　Yesterday was rainy in Beiping City, so there were very few transactions of cotton cloth. By the close of the market, sales were less than a quarter of the amount available, so prices remained stable. Dyed cloth showed a downward trend. Other general merchandise was also in short supply. Although prices were low, transactions were not numerous. Sugar prices continued to fall, while salt prices rose. Because most salt-storing households have sold out their stocks, they are now mostly buying from trading companies and selling in the market, so prices are firm.

　　平市经济动态
  小麦红粮价格略涨　小米有外流现象
    平市昨日粮价仍呈平稳，惟小麦红粮略涨。原因是本市几家面粉厂（如三元宫、福兴等）每天需向市上购进小麦万余斤。而日来红粮、小米略趋小扬，系因有部分投机商人购进后运向城外销售。
    　　　　糖市平疲食盐微升
    平市昨日阴雨，故纱布成交甚少，至收盘时，销售量不及上市之四分之一，故价呈平稳。色布有下落趋势。其他百货上市亦很少。价虽低，但成交不多，糖价仍落，盐价上升。因一般存盐户大部售完，目前多向贸易公司买进，到市场售卖，故要价硬。
