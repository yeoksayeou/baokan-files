The current postage is not high.
Liangxiang Post Office cannot offer long-term free service.

Comrade Liu Pu:

Regarding your suggestions on postage and postal services for revolutionary soldiers, our reply is as follows:

1. After the postage adjustment, a regular letter is now eleven times more expensive than the previous 500 Yuan of the Jin-Cha-Ji Border Region currency. At first glance, it seems like a big increase; but in terms of price levels, 500 Yuan of border region currency could buy five liang (approximately 250 grams) of rice last January, while 6 Yuan of Renminbi now can only buy six liang of rice. The original standard set by the North China Government was one jin (approximately 500 grams) of rice per regular letter, which is still much less compared to that. Even before the War of Resistance, a regular letter cost five cents, which could also buy one jin of white flour. Therefore, it is not that the increase is too much now, but that we set the price too low in the past. If it remains low, it would be cheaper for the senders, but the burden on the people would increase (because government expenditure would increase). This is not in line with the principle of concentrating efforts on developing production and supporting the front lines, and is not in the interest of the people.

2. You mentioned that the Liangxiang Post Office offered free postage during the Lunar New Year. The post office does have such a regulation, which is intended for New Year's greetings and preferential treatment for the army. Of course, it cannot be free for the long term. However, our failure to promptly notify our troops about this is an oversight on our part, and we should pay attention to it in the future.

### 目前邮费并不算高　良乡邮局不能长期免费

　　目前邮费并不算高
    良乡邮局不能长期免费刘璞同志：
    关于邮费与革命军人邮信问题的建议，答复如下：
    一、邮资调整之后，一封平信比过去原晋察冀五百元边币增加了十一倍，猛一看好象是涨了不少；但按物价算，去年一月边币五百元可买五两米，现在人民币六元只买六两米。华北政府原规定的标准是一封平信一斤米，比较起来，还是少的多。即以抗战前说，一封平信五分钱，也能买一斤白面。所以不是现在增的多，而是过去我们订价太低了。如果仍然低下去，寄信人倒是便宜了，而人民负担却增加了（因政府的开支加大了）。这在集中力量发展生产，支援前线的原则下，是不符合人民利益的。
    二、你说良乡局在旧历年免费寄信问题，邮局确有此规定，那是为了年关慰劳和优待军队。当然不能长期免费，唯以后未及时通知我们各部队，是我们忽略之处，今后应该注意。
