[Jizhong News] Village cadres in Lijian River and other villages in Hejian, Eighth Prefecture, are grasping production leadership and actively preparing for spring plowing and sowing. Three Party member cadres in Lijian River, Hejian, put forward individual plans and helped the masses make production plans. Fangzhuangzi Village in Huanghua County, at a meeting of Party member cadres, made a plan to lead the masses in production in an organized and step-by-step manner. The first step of the plan is mainly publicity and deliberation, using the practical example of Party member Liu Fengshan's intensive cultivation last year (weeding six times, harvesting twelve bags of grain from five mu of land) and other model examples to conduct extensive publicity and education among the masses, further enhancing the production enthusiasm of the masses. Junzhuang Village in Renqiu County, at a meeting of Party member cadres, specifically arranged to help the families of revolutionary martyrs, soldiers, and workers make production plans.

[Another News] Farmers in various parts of the Eighth Prefecture are actively sending manure ahead of time to prepare for spring plowing and sowing. In Fu Village, Renhe, due to the village cadres' tight grip on production leadership, by the fifteenth day of the first month, more than one hundred households in the village had completed sending manure, and forty-seven households were continuing to send manure. As a result, the area of land fertilized this year has also been greatly expanded. Sun Shitou, a poor peasant, had five mu of land allocated during rent reduction, which had not been fertilized for several years, but this year he applied three large carts of manure. Every family cleaned out the manure accumulated in livestock sheds and pigsties and applied it to the land. Wu Qinghe of Wu Pan Village always waited for others to finish sending manure before sending his own in previous years, but this year he finished sending manure on the second day of the first month. Around the tenth day of the first month, four hundred households of farmers in Jianguo Da Cuier Village were breaking up manure, and more than one hundred households were sending manure, including more than twenty women participating in the work of breaking and sending manure. In Xiaoxi, Hejian, more than half of the households had finished sending manure by the tenth day of the first month. In Nanmatan and Li Village, more than ninety pieces of farm tools were repaired on the first day of the first month alone. In Huanghua County, villages that have completed or are nearing completion of land reform have all sent out their manure.

　　冀中李涧河村干抓紧领导生产
    八专区各地送粪准备春耕
    【冀中讯】八专区河间李涧河等村村干部抓紧生产领导，积极准备春耕播种。河间李涧河三个党员干部，个人提出计划以后，并帮助群众作生产计划。黄骅县方庄子村在党员干部会上，作出了有组织有步骤的领导群众生产的计划。计划的第一步主要的是宣传酝酿，就以党员刘凤山去年的精耕细作（锄六遍草，五亩地打了十二口袋粮食）的实际例子，和其他的模范事例，在群众中进行广泛的宣传教育，更加提高了群众的生产积极性。任邱县军庄在党员干部会上，具体布置了帮助烈、军、工属作生产计划。
    【又讯】八专署各地农民正积极提前送粪，准备春耕播种。任河阜庄由于村干对生产领导抓的紧，到正月十五日，全村已有一百多户把粪送完，四十七户正在继续送粪。因此今年上粪的土地面积也大大的扩大了，贫农孙石头减租时分的五亩地，几年来没上过粪，今年上了三大车。各家都把牲口棚、猪圈里积的粪出干净上了地。吴潘庄吴庆合往年总是别人送完粪他才送，今年正月初二就把粪送完了。建国大崔尔庄正月初十前后有四百户农民捣粪，一百多户送粪，其中有廿多个妇女参加捣送大粪的工作。河间小溪正月初十就有半数以上的户送完了粪。南马滩、李家两村，正月初一一天就修理好农具九十多件。黄骅县已结束土地改革和土地改革将近完成的村庄，粪肥已全部送完。
