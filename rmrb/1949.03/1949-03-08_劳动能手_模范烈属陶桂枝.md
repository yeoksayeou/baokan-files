　　Labor Model
  　Model Revolutionary Martyr's Family Member, Tao Guizhi
    Chen Xi
    People in the sixth district of Pinggu County, Jidong, all know that there is a labor model in Shuangying Village named Tao Guizhi. When they mention her, they all say, "No one can compare to her, she can do more than a man!" She is twenty-eight years old this year, with a strong body and a straightforward personality. Before the land reform, she did not own an acre of land. Her husband sacrificed himself in the anti-Japanese guerrilla forces in the 30th year of the Republic of China (1941). When he left, the family only had one sheng of corn kernels, one basket of sweet potato leaves, and an eight-month-old child. She thought, "One sheng of corn kernels can only last for two days for the two of us, how will we live after that?" After thinking it over and over, she made up her mind to rely on her own efforts. She borrowed a spinning wheel and spun thread from dawn till dark. At first, she didn't spin much, but the more she spun, the more skilled she became. Every day, in addition to breastfeeding and picking up firewood, she had to spin thirteen liang of cotton. Every summer, she made shoe soles and sold them, making about one pair a day. This is how she and her child survived. During the land reform, she was allocated nine and a half mu of land and was elected as a production committee member by the masses. She did not ask the village to cultivate the land for her, but did it herself: building fences, composting, plowing, weeding seedlings, hoeing the ground, harvesting, and driving the pack animals. She did all the work herself. Last year, she planted four mu of millet, five mu of corn, and six fen of cotton. She applied a lot of fertilizer, and the crops grew very well, averaging more than one dan per mu (sixteen jin per dou), and harvested more than seventy jin of seed cotton. Last summer, during heavy rain, she braved the rain and waded through the water to deliver fertilizer to the fields and harvest crops. During the wheat harvest, she pulled wheat for others. Others pulled four ridges in half a day, but she pulled four and a half ridges. In May, others only hoed three mu of land a day, but she hoed her four mu of millet in one day. Others are busy and idle at different times of the year, but Tao Guizhi is always busy all year round. She works in the fields during the busy farming season, and makes soles and spins thread during the slack season, never wasting a day. Relying on her own labor, she lives a life of plenty, with no worries about food and clothing. The whole village praised her and said, "She can really work hard and live a good life, there's no one like her!" Not only does she work hard and produce well herself, but she also motivates and organizes more than fifty women in the village to participate in agricultural production and spinning. She also regularly leads women to meetings to promote the work in the village. During the autumn grain requisition, she paid the public grain first. Last August, she led the women of the village to make more than a thousand quilts for a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army. She herself made twelve cotton quilts in one day and one night. Her style is very simple and she is supported by cadres and the masses. At the county women's congress, she was elected as a representative to the Jidong Women's Congress and as an executive member of the County Women's Federation; and it was unanimously proposed to learn from her.

  　模范烈属陶桂枝
    陈曦
    冀东平谷县第六区的人们都知道双营村有一个劳动模范陶桂枝，提起她来都说：“谁也比不了，她比男的还能干！”她今年廿八岁，身体精壮，性情刚强直爽。土地改革前没有一亩地，丈夫在民国卅年参加抗日游击队牺牲了。临走时家中只剩下一升玉米渣、一笼筐白薯叶，和一个八个月的小孩子。她想：“一升玉米渣，娘儿俩只能活两天，以后的日子怎么过呢？”她左思右想下定了自力更生的决心，就借了一辆纺车，起早搭黑的纺线，开始纺不多，越纺越手熟，每天除了奶孩子、拾柴火以外，总要纺十三两棉花，每年夏天就纳大鞋底子卖，差不多每天能纳一双，娘儿俩的生活就这样维持下来。土地改革中她分了九亩半地，被群众选为生产委员，她不用村中代耕，自己动手经营：起圈、捣粪、扶犁、耨苗、＠地、收割、赶驮子，一切活计都是自己做。去年她种了四亩谷子、五亩玉米，和六分棉花，上的粪特别多，庄稼长的很好，平均每亩打一石多（每斗十六斤），又收了七十多斤籽棉。去年夏天下大雨，她顶着雨、淌水往地里送粪、收庄稼。麦收时，她给人家拔麦子，别人半天拔四垄，她拔了四垄半。五月，别人一天只＠三亩地，她的四亩谷子一天就＠完。一年四季别人都有闲有忙、惟独陶桂枝一年到头总是忙，农忙时下地干活，农闲时纳底子、纺线，从不空过一天，靠她双手劳动日子过的吃穿不愁，全村人都称赞她说：“真能辛苦过日子，没二份！”她不但自己劳动生产好，还带动、组织起全村五十多个妇女参加了农业生产和纺线，并经常领导妇女开会推动村中工作。在秋征时，她先缴了公粮，去年八月她领导全村妇女给人民解放军某部作了一千多床被子，她一个人一天一夜就赶做出棉被十二床。她的作风很朴实，得到干部和群众的拥护，在全县的妇女大会上被选为出席冀东妇女代表会的代表，和县妇联会执行委员；并一致提出要向她学习。
