International Week

　　During the March 8th International Women's Day, democratic women all over the world held high the banner of "Oppose New War, Defend Peace" and launched large-scale demonstrations against warmongers in the United States and other countries. Every major city and industrial center in France, and even the usually peaceful provincial towns, held grand demonstrations and parades. More than 30,000 women and men in Paris, regardless of police interference and obstruction, held gatherings and parades in the suburbs of Paris. The calls of "Unite to Defend Peace," "French Mothers Will Never Let Their Children Fight Against the Soviet Union," and "Down with the Instigators of New Wars" resounded through the sky. Mrs. Gordon, representing the 80 million members of the Women's International Democratic Federation, emphasized in her speech that defending peace is the most important task for women this year, and if all women oppose war, war will not happen. Democratic women and progressive women's groups in Italy, Germany, Austria, the United States, and other capitalist countries held gatherings and parades or issued circulars and declarations, demonstrating their united will and determination to fight to prevent new wars and defend peace. Soviet women also have a special place in this struggle. The Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union issued a resolution on March 8th International Women's Day on the eve of March 8th, clearly instructing that Soviet women are at the forefront of the international women's movement to strive for democratic peace and oppose the instigators of new wars. Petrova, secretary of the Soviet Women's Anti-Fascist Committee, stated that Soviet women will do everything possible to help the world's women in their struggle for peace and democracy. Chinese women, who are in the midst of a revolutionary upsurge, are busy preparing for the upcoming National Women's Congress to complete the great unity of women across the country in order to fight for the rapid realization of the national revolutionary victory. All the efforts made by Chinese women for the victory of the national revolution have made a great contribution to the cause of defending world lasting peace.
　　At the same time, other mass movements to defend peace are continuing to develop in various countries around the world. The call issued by the World Congress of Intellectuals in Defense of Peace and the Women's International Democratic Federation, etc., at the end of last month to the democratic people of the world to convene the World Peace Congress in April this year, has been warmly supported and responded to by the World Federation of Democratic Youth, the International Union of Students, mass organizations in the Soviet Union and the new democratic countries, many labor organizations and democratic groups in France, Britain, Italy, the United States, etc., and progressive people. They are preparing to send representatives to participate in this congress of people all over the world united against new wars. The working people of Italy have launched large-scale demonstrations and strikes to oppose the Gasperi reactionary government's participation in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization's aggressive bloc. On the 12th, thousands of young people in Rome held a demonstration in front of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, shouting: "We want peace!" "Down with Sforza!" "Let them go to war themselves!" Lightning protest strikes have erupted in the industrial area of ​​northern Italy. (United Press) According to TASS, the peace movement in France has become a truly national people's movement, and workers in many cities have gone on strike demanding peace. The tide of people's movements against new wars has also swept through Germany, Northern Europe, and the Middle East.
　　In the face of the surging movement to defend world peace, it is easier to understand that the plan implemented by American imperialists and their lackeys to prepare for new wars is not terrible. This plan, because it is under the attack of people all over the world, cannot but be fragile in itself. The preliminary draft of the "North Atlantic Treaty," which is a tool for American imperialist war preparations, began to be drafted in early December last year and was not completed until January this year. The signing of this treaty was originally said to be in mid-March, but now, according to U.S. Secretary of State Acheson, it has been changed to "hopefully achieved in early April." This repeated delay is the result of the many contradictions within the imperialist countries participating in this "treaty."
　　While the Vietnamese people are preparing to achieve greater victories in the war of independence this year, the French reactionaries' puppet show of restoring the Vietnamese deposed king Bao Dai is nearing its performance. They attempt to use this old sign to deceive the people and split the anti-imperialist camp in Vietnam, in order to save France's colonial rule in Vietnam, which is nearing its end. And American imperialism is acting as the behind-the-scenes string-puller of this puppet show. Bao Dai signed a traitorous agreement with the French president on the 23rd of last month. France called Bao Dai to serve as the head of the puppet Vietnamese government, and Bao Dai accepted France's partition policy, dividing Vietnam into Laos, Cambodia, and Vietnam, three so-called "independent countries within the French Federation," and selling Vietnam's economic, diplomatic, military, and other national rights and interests entirely to France. However, as soon as the Franco-Vietnamese traitorous agreement was announced, it was immediately severely countered by the people of Vietnam and France. According to a recent broadcast by the Voice of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam: President Ho Chi Minh has announced that the government will never forgive traitors, and the government is formulating a list of war criminals. The Vietnamese People's Government reiterates that the Vietnamese people are determined to fight on until the French colonialists are completely eliminated. When the French Federal Assembly approved the agreement signed between France and Bao Dai on the 10th, all the French Communist Party members of parliament stood up and shouted: "Down with the shameful war of aggression against Vietnam," and walked out of the venue to protest. Some progressive members of parliament also joined this protest.
　　Other more important international events recently include:
　　(1) The fifth session of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union opened on the 10th. The meeting will adopt the Soviet Union's national budget for 1949 and the orders issued by the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet.
　　(2) The Politburo of the Japanese Communist Party recently passed a resolution calling on the Japanese working people to launch a struggle to overthrow the reactionary Yoshida government.
　　(3) British imperialism is actively preparing to convene an emergency federal conference to discuss the organization of a "Pacific Anti-Communist Alliance" to suppress the rising national liberation movement in British colonies.
　　(4) The movement against the "trial" of the leaders of the American Communist Party continues to develop in the United States. During the "trial" period, progressive people in the United States have been holding patrols and demonstrations outside the courthouse, demanding the cancellation of anti-communist charges and the cessation of American-style Reichstag fire cases.

专栏：国际一周

　　国际一周
    在三八国际妇女节，全世界民主妇女高举着“反对新战争保卫和平”的大旗，向美国和其他国家的战争贩子们发动大示威。法国每一个主要城市和工业中心，甚至一向平静的各省城镇，都举行了盛大的示威游行。巴黎三万余妇女和男子，不顾警察的干涉和阻挠，在巴黎市郊举行集会和游行。“团结起来保卫和平”、“法国的母亲们决不让她们的孩子们去对苏作战”、“打倒新战争挑拨者”的呼声，响澈云霄。戈登夫人代表国际民主妇女联盟的八千万会员在会上讲演时，强调指出：保卫和平是今年妇女们的一件最重要的任务，假若一切妇女都反对战争，战争就不会发生。意大利、德国、奥地利、美国及其他资本主义国家内的民主妇女和进步妇女团体，或举行集会和游行或发表通电和宣言，表明了团结一致为阻止新战争与保卫和平而奋斗的意志和决心。苏联妇女在这一斗争中也有特殊的地位。苏联共产党中央委员会在三八节前夕发布了关于三八国际妇女节的决定，明确指示：苏联妇女是站在争取民主和平与反对新战争挑拨者的国际妇女运动的前哨。苏联妇女反法西斯委员会书记彼得洛娃表示：苏联妇女将尽一切努力帮助世界妇女争和平争民主的斗争。处在革命高潮中的中国妇女，正在忙碌地准备即将召开的全国妇女代表大会，完成全国妇女的大团结，以便为全国革命胜利的迅速实现而斗争。中国妇女为全国革命胜利而付出的一切努力，对保卫世界持久和平的事业有着极大的贡献。
    与此同时，保卫和平的其他的群众性运动，也正在世界各国继续发展。世界文化工作者保卫和平大会和国际民主妇联等，于上月底向世界民主人民发出的于今年四月召开世界和平拥护者大会的呼吁，已经获得世界民主青联、国际学联、苏联和新民主各国的群众团体，法国、英国、意大利、美国等许多工人组织和民主团体和进步人民的热烈支持和响应，它们正在准备派遣代表参加这个全世界人民团结反对新战争的大会。意大利劳动人民已展开大规模的示威和罢工运动，反对加斯贝利反动政府参加北大西洋公约侵略集团。十二日，罗马数千青年在外交部前面举行示威，高呼：“我们要和平”！“打倒史佛卓”！“她们自己去打仗吧！”在意大利北部工业区，已爆发了闪电式的抗议罢工。（合众社）法国的和平运动，据塔斯社报道：已成为真正全国性的人民运动，许多城市的工人都停工要求和平。反对新战争的人民运动的浪潮，亦席卷德国，北欧及中东诸国。
    在高涨的保卫世界和平的大运动面前，来看美国帝国主义者及其喽罗们所实行的准备新战争的计划，就更容易明白它是不可怕的了。这个计划因为处在全世界人民的攻击之下，本身不能不带着脆弱性，作为美国帝国主义战争准备工具的“北大西洋公约”的初步草案，从去年十二月上旬起即已开始起草，直到今年一月始告完成。这一公约的签订，原说在三月中旬，现在按照美国国务卿艾奇逊的话来说，已改为“希望于四月初实现”。这种一再迁延，乃是参加这个“公约”的帝国主义国家内部发生重重矛盾的结果。
    当越南人民正在准备于今年取得独立战争的更大胜利的时候，法国反动派使越南废王保大复辟的傀儡剧已接近演出，它们企图利用这块旧招牌来欺骗人民和分裂越南的反帝阵营，借以抢救法国在越南接近末日的殖民统治。而美国帝国主义又充当了这个傀儡剧的幕后牵线人。保大于上月二十三日和法总统已签订了卖国协定，法国叫保大充任伪越南政府的头子，保大则接受法国的分治政策，把越南分裂成老挝、柬埔寨与越南等三个所谓“法兰西联邦体制内独立国”，并将越南的经济、外交、军事等整个国家权益，全部出卖给法国。但法越卖国协定刚一宣布，立即遭到越法两国人民的严重反击。据越南人民民主共和国电台最近广播：胡明总统已宣布政府对于卖国贼决不宽恕，且政府正在制订战犯名单，越南人民政府并重申越南人民决心作战下去，直到完全消灭法国殖民者为止。在法国联邦议会于十日批准法国与保大签订的协定时，法国共产党议员全体起立高呼：“打倒侵略越南的可耻战争”，并走出会场，以示抗议。一部份进步的议员也参加了这个抗议。
    最近国际间其他较重要事件如下：
    （一）苏联最高苏维埃第五次会议已于十日揭幕，会议将通过苏联一九四九年的国家预算和最高苏维埃主席团已颁发的命令。
    （二）日本共产党政治局近通过决议，号召日本劳动人民发动推翻吉田反动政府的斗争。
    （三）英帝国主义正积极准备召开紧急联邦会议，讨论组织“太平洋反共同盟”，以镇压英属各殖民地中正在高涨中的民族解放运动。
    （四）反对“审讯”美共领袖的运动，在美国继续发展。在“审讯”时期，美国进步人民在法庭门外，一直举行着巡逻示威，他们要求取消反共控告、制止美国式的德国国会纵火案。
