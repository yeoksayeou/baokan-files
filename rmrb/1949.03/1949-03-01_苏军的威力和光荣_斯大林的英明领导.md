　　The Power and Glory of the Soviet Army
    -- The Wise Leadership of Stalin
    By Soviet Marshal Konev
    The heroic struggle of the Soviet people against German fascism and Japanese imperialism was led by the great leader and strategist Stalin. He commanded the Soviet armed forces. Stalin's leadership was the most important factor in the victory of the Soviet people.
    The Soviet people and their army have full confidence in the invincible power of their beloved leader's great strategic genius and wise leadership. The Soviet people's historic victory in the civil war, and the great achievements of socialism in the Soviet Union, are linked to Stalin's name. In the great patriotic war to defeat the enemy, Stalin's name was a banner of victory. The direct leadership of each front was concentrated in the hands of Generalissimo Stalin, the Supreme Commander of the Soviet Army. He was the architect of all our strategic plans in the war. The major campaigns of the Soviet Army were carried out according to the plans drawn up by the Supreme Commander, and were executed under his direct leadership.
    During the war, Stalin selected new military commanders who successfully executed his wise plans, cultivated them, and promoted them to important positions. Every front commander can cite many facts illustrating how Generalissimo Stalin paid attention to us, how he educated, cultivated and led us. We will never forget the meetings that Stalin held with us in the headquarters, we regard those meetings as treasures. Those meetings were in effect a high school for each of us, a veritable school of military art. Stalin's handling of any military problem, his solution to operational problems, his instructions on tactics, troop organization, and rear service work, his cordial concern for the needs of military personnel—his entire leadership style was a program of action for our front commanders and all Soviet military personnel, and a guiding principle in our daily work. For example, Generalissimo Stalin often pointed out that it is necessary to judge the situation at a given moment accurately and carefully. If this is not done, any operational order will be impossible to execute. This fact plays a huge role in the work of the front commanders.
    Generalissimo Stalin was willing to give front commanders the opportunity to explain their ideas at any time, and to give play to their creative talents. And in the course of the discussion, Generalissimo Stalin always used his unparalleled clarity and his genius to guide the commanders to make thorough and extremely correct decisions according to the specific situation. It must be pointed out that commanders had every possible opportunity to give play to their creativity when drawing up plans under Stalin's leadership. The most outstanding point is that Generalissimo Stalin paid extraordinary attention to the commanders of the various units, especially the commanders of the tank units, when deploying troops and equipment. He knew all the army commanders and the commanders of the tank corps. When assigning certain armies to certain operational tasks, he would specify the names of the army commanders, and carefully inquire on the spot about their operations on the front lines.
    It should be emphasized that in planning operations, Stalin paid particular attention to the quality and quantity of equipment, and gave specific instructions on the use of tanks, artillery, and air force. After thoroughly arranging all major battles, Stalin personally maintained contact with the front commanders by telephone.
    I will never forget any of those brief but meaningful and extremely important conversations. It has happened more than once that a word from Generalissimo Stalin can give a new explanation to the situation and guide us to think along the correct path. Generalissimo Stalin was guiding us and helping us every day. We thank him for teaching us to master the science of modern warfare.
    One of the factors guaranteeing the victory of the Soviet Army is the fact that the Soviet Army is guided by the advanced Stalinist military science. Stalinist military science points out the only correct path for solving all problems in conducting operations and campaigns in modern warfare. The method of creatively dealing with problems, as well as outstanding originality, is a characteristic of all military actions of the Soviet army in the Great Patriotic War. In the history of military art, never has there been such a variety of offensive operations as that of the Soviet army, which is precisely the characteristic of the Soviet army's offensive.
    Throughout the Great Patriotic War, Stalin's military science was always gloriously victorious. (Note: This article is an abstract of the original text of the Red Star newspaper broadcast by TASS on February 23, originally titled "The Power and Glory of the Soviet Army".)

　　苏军的威力和光荣
    ——斯大林的英明领导
    苏联元帅  科涅夫  作
    苏联人民反对德国法西斯及日本帝国主义者的英勇斗争，是伟大的领袖与战略家斯大林所领导的。他统率着苏联武装部队。斯大林的领导，是苏联人民胜利的最重要的因素。
    苏联人民及其军队，对于他们敬爱的领袖的伟大战略天才和英明领导的必胜威力，具有充分的信心。苏联人民在内战中的具有历史意义的胜利，以及社会主义在苏联的伟大成就，是与斯大林的名字相结连着的。在为击溃敌人而进行的伟大爱国战争中，斯大林的名字是一面胜利的旗帜。各个战线的直接领导，都集中在苏军总司令斯大林大元帅的手里。他是我们在战争中的一切战略计划的拟订人。苏军的各次重大战役，都是按照总司令所拟订的计划进行的，并且是在他直接领导下执行的。
    在战争期间，斯大林曾将那些成功地执行了他的英明计划的新的军事指挥员们选拔出来，培养他们，并提拔他们到重要的职位上去。每个前线指挥员，都能举出许多事实，说明斯大林大元帅是怎样地注意我们，怎样地教育、培养和领导我们。我们永远不会忘记斯大林和我们在司令部里所举行的那些会议，我们把那些会议看作珍宝一般。那些会议，对于我们每一个人，实际上都是一个高级学校，是名符其实的军事艺术学校。斯大林对任何军事问题的处理，对作战问题的解决，对战术、部队组织及后方工作的指示，对军事人员的需要的亲切关怀——他的整个领导作风，对我们前线指挥员和一切苏联军事人员，都是行动的纲领，是我们日常工作的指导原则。例如：斯大林大元帅曾经常地指出，必须精确与周密地判断一定时刻的情况。如果不这样的话，任何作战命令都会是无法执行的。这一事实，在前线指挥员的工作中，是起着巨大作用的。
    斯大林大元帅愿意随时给予前线指挥员以说明他们的思想的机会、和发挥他们的创造性才能的机会。而在讨论过程中，斯大林大元帅随时都用他的无比的明确性和他的天才，引导指挥员们去透澈地、极正确地按一定的情况作出决定。必须指出，在斯大林领导下拟订计划时，指挥员们是有着发挥其创造力的一切可能的。最特出的一点是，斯大林大元帅在部署部队和装备时，对各个部队的指挥员，尤其是坦克部队的指挥员，都加以异乎寻常的重大注意。他认识所有的军长和坦克兵团的指挥员。当指定某些军担任某些作战任务时，他就指明军长们的名字，并在当时当地仔细地询问他们在前线作战的情形。
    应该着重指出：在计划作战的时候，斯大林特别重视装备的质与量，而且对坦克、炮兵和空军的使用，给予具体的指示。在周密地布置好一切重大战事之后，斯大林就用电话亲自和前线指挥员们保持接触。
    我将永不会忘记任何那些简短而意义深刻的、并且极关重要的谈话。不止一次地发生过这样的事情：斯大林大元帅的一句话，就能给形势以新的说明。并指导我们按正确的道路去思考。斯大林大元帅每天都在指导我们，帮助我们。我们感谢他教导我们掌握现化战争的科学。
    保证苏军胜利的因素之一，是这样事实：就是苏军是受着先进的斯大林军事科学的指导的。斯大林军事科学，对现代战争中进行作战和战役的一切问题的解决，指出了唯一正确的道路。创造性的处理问题的方法，以及卓越的创见，是苏联军队在伟大爱国战争中一切军事行动的特点。在军事艺术的历史上，从来没有见过象苏军那样在攻势作战行动中的变化多端，这正是苏军攻势的特点。
    在伟大爱国战争的全部过程中，斯大林的军事科学始终是胜利辉煌的。（按：本文系塔斯社二月二十三日播发的红星报原文的摘要，原题是“苏军的威力和光荣”。）
