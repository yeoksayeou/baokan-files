　　Glorious Reorganization!
　　Yang Shuo
　　The former Kuomintang 35th Army's 267th Division, reorganized into the People's Liberation Army's Independent 99th Division and formally incorporated into the PLA's establishment, was warmly welcomed by representatives from a certain PLA division with brotherly affection and a letter of慰问. A theatrical troupe from another division even braved the wind and sand to perform and offer慰劳. Those soldiers who had endured humiliation and hardship in the old army were overjoyed to see the happy and democratic life of the military and civilians in the liberated areas in the plays, unable to stop their enthusiastic applause. One junior officer said to me after watching the play, "To be honest, who wouldn't like this kind of peace? Otherwise, I might have been captured again!"
　　Before the liberation of Beiping, this 267th Division had been completely wiped out at Xinbaoan. Later, they pieced together a new force, also taking in some officers who had been released from Xinbaoan to form the current unit. Zhang Meiting, the团长 of the 801st Regiment, was one of the released officers. He still pales at the mention of the PLA's fierce firepower at Xinbaoan. As soon as Beiping was besieged, everyone thought, "Oh no, here come the炮 again! Won't we end up like Xinbaoan if they start fighting?" But it was precisely because of the PLA's powerful and invincible strength that the Beiping-style peace was achieved. However, many people had been deceived by long-term propaganda and could not immediately dispel their doubts about this peace. Zhang Minggao, the deputy连长 of the 7th Company, 3rd Battalion, 800th Regiment, expressed the feelings of most officers and soldiers at the time:
　　"We often heard that once you were captured by the PLA, terrible things would happen. When it came to a peaceful resolution, we worried about ourselves and our families. Would they still want us? My family has nothing to eat! As soon as we left Beiping and stayed in Liangxiang, we were always afraid that the PLA would surround and wipe us out. We intensified our sentry duty day and night, not daring to let go of our guns, fearing that the machine guns would go '嘟嘟' and take our lives. But the democratic government allocated provisions to us. Our meals and待遇 were the same as the PLA, and the菜 was much richer than before. A few days ago, when we moved from Liangxiang to here and were formally incorporated into the PLA, we started to worry again: I wonder how they will reorganize us? As soon as we got off the train and arrived at the village, the villagers came out to welcome us, the houses were allocated, and the洗脚水 was already boiling in the pot. Before we arrived, the PLA first used large trucks to transport many pounds of cabbage from Tangshan for us, and also distributed a pound of meat each, which was sent from the Northeast to慰劳 the PLA from afar. You see, I have never been so well-treated in all my years as a soldier! When the指导员 first came, some people still used the old way of thinking and said: The secret agents are here! But looking at our 指导员, he doesn't look like the Kuomintang's, who only knew how to stir up trouble and monitor individuals. Instead, he tells us many new principles and opens our minds. Up to now, the words of the PLA have all been兑现, but I still have worries in my heart: For example, what will happen to my family? What will happen to me in the future?"
　　In fact, even these last remaining doubts have already been answered by facts. The PLA has already printed preferential treatment certificates for military families. Every newly reorganized officer and soldier, as long as their family is in the liberated area, can receive help from the local government just like the PLA soldiers. And the officers, whether they choose to leave, stay, or study, can all make their own choices. Now, when you go to the companies of this newly formed division, you can already hear joyful秧歌 and heroic military songs. When a "卫士" in the 799th Regiment retorted forcefully to an adjutant's scolding for the first time, he said, "Why are you getting angry? Now we emphasize persuasion and education, not beating and scolding!" The blood of freedom and democracy has begun to be injected into this army, which was once a dark and hopeless place. No wonder that when someone raised his fist and shouted "Welcome the reorganization into the People's Liberation Army" on the stage, many fists below the stage followed suit and shouted the same slogan.

　　光荣的改编！
    杨朔
    原国民党三十五军二六七师，改编成人民解放军独立九十九师，正式归入解放军建制后，解放军某师立即以兄弟般的热情，派了代表带着慰问信，热忱欢迎。另一个师的剧团更不避风沙，赶来演戏慰劳。那些在旧军队里忍辱含垢的士兵们，一旦在戏剧里见到解放区军民愉快而民主的生活，兴奋得合不拢嘴，止不住热烈的鼓掌。有一位下级军官看了戏对我说道：“照实说，这一和平，谁不喜欢？要不，说不定我又会再一次的当了俘虏！”
    原来在北平解放之前，这个二六七师曾在新保安被歼灭得一干二净，后来东拼西凑，又收容一些从新保安释放回来的军官，才凑成现在这个部队。八○一团团长张梅亭便是被释放的军官之一，谈起解放军在新保安火力之猛，他至今还不免失色。北平一围城，大家就想：“炮啊，又完了！一打还不要象新保安一样？”但是正由于解放军强大无敌的力量。才产生了北平式的和平。不过对这个和平，许多人长期受着欺骗宣传，并不能一下子消除怀疑。八零零团三营七连副连长张鸣皋说出从前大部官兵的心情：
    “常听说解放军抓去就怎么怎么的，临到和平解决，又想到自己，想到家里，会不会不要我了？家里人没吃的！刚开出北平，住在良乡，老怕解放军把我们圈起来消灭了。白天黑夜加紧放哨，枪都不敢离手，就怕机关枪一嘟嘟，就要了命。可是民主政府拨来给养了，吃饭待遇，都跟解放军一样，菜比早先丰富得多。前两天从良乡开到这里，正式归入解放军，心里又犯起嘀咕来：也不知道怎么个编法？一下火车，到村，老乡也接出来，房子也分配好了，洗脚水都烧的现成在锅里。咱们没来以前，解放军先拿大卡车从唐山替咱运到好多斤白菜，还有从东北老远送来慰劳解放军的肉，也分给我们一个人一斤。你看，我当了这些年兵，从来也没有这样体面过！指导员刚来，有人还用旧时的看法说：特务来了！可是看看咱们的指导员，一点不象国民党的光会挑拨离间，监视个人；倒给大家讲许多新道理，叫人开窍。直到现在，解放军说的话，都兑现了，不过我心里还是有发愁的事：好比说家里怎么办？自己往后怎么办？”
    其实就是这最后残存的怀疑，也已经有了事实的答复了。解放军已经印好军人家属优待证，每个新改编过来的官兵，只要家在解放区，都可以象解放军一样得到当地政府的帮助。而军官们或去或留或学习，也都能任凭他们自己的选择。现在，你走到这个新编师的连队上，已经可以听见愉快的秧歌和雄壮的军歌。七九九团一个“卫士”在回答一个副官的詈骂时，第一次发出有力的辩驳：“你发什么脾气？现在讲说服教育，不兴打骂了！”自由民主的血液开始注入这个曾经是暗无天日的军队里，难怪在戏场上一个人举起拳头喊“欢迎改编成解放军”时，台下许多拳头就随之举起，发出了同样的呼喊。
