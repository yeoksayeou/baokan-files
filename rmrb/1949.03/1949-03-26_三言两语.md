　　A Few Words
　　　　Farm Loans Should Be Inspected in a Timely Manner to See Where They Are Going
　　The amount of farm loans issued in various regions is very large. It is indeed worth inspecting to see who they have been issued to and what role they have played. Most regions have done a good job, but some staff members are stuck in the old ways of bureaucracy, only knowing to ask for more and more from above, and only pursuing a numerical figure of how much has been issued to those below. In this situation, farm loans often become an object of waste and profiteering by a small number of people. The biased distribution of farm loans in Tianzhen, as reported in today's newspaper, is a typical example. Is the farm loan serving to make "production grow an inch"? Is it in the hands of the basic masses of the working people, becoming a support force on the production front? Is the principle of the mass line being adopted to reasonably, fairly, and effectively meet the needs of the masses? Is it being supervised by the People's Representative Conference, farmers' associations, and cooperatives? It is hoped that all regions will conduct timely inspections. All biases similar to those that occurred in Tianzhen must be resolutely stopped.
　　　　Starting with the Shijiazhuang Farmers' Service Center
　　The Farmers' Service Center established by the Shijiazhuang Supply and Marketing Cooperative has helped farmers reduce much intermediate exploitation and eliminated the old society's bad habit of the city exploiting the countryside over the past three months. This is one of the new forms of urban-rural relations and is worthy of promotion in various regions. In today's basically completely liberated North China, the economic and cultural exchange between urban and rural areas, and the mutual promotion of production, are indeed matters of utmost urgency. Many methods should be devised and experimented with. Recently, some city doctors have gone to the countryside to prevent epidemics and eliminate plagues, and students have gone to the countryside to promote culture, all of which are very good measures.
　　　　Economic Cadres Should Pay Attention to Inspecting Their Thoughts
　　Economic department cadres, who hold the state's wealth and economic power, must be constantly vigilant, stand firm in their positions, and prevent all possible external inducements and dissolution. In this regard, we have constantly exposed various facts to sound the alarm. The recent ideological inspection of cadres conducted by the Taihang People's Bank is entirely necessary. From the inspection, they have truly recognized the importance of criticism and self-criticism as a weapon. Because only by eliminating the influence of capitalist ideas remaining in the minds of some comrades can we establish strict discipline, clear our minds, and complete the task assigned to us by the Party of learning to do economic work.

　　三言两语
            农贷发到何处应及时检查
    各地农贷发放数目很大，发给谁了，起了什么作用，确值得检查。大部份地区办得是好的，可是也有些工作人员官僚主义老一套，对上，只知道要得越多越好；对下，只追逐一个完成发放多少的数目字。在这种情况下，农贷常常成了少数人浪费牟利的对象。今天报上发表的天镇发放农贷偏向，便是一个典型例子。农贷是否为“生产长一寸”服务，是否掌握在劳动人民基本群众手里，成为生产战线的一支援军，是否采取群众路线的方针，合理、公平、有效地来真正满足了群众需要，是否为人民代表会议、农会以及合作社所监督？希望各地都来及时检查。一切类似天镇所发生的偏向都必须坚决制止。
    　　　　从石家庄农民服务所谈起
    石家庄供销合作总社设置的农民服务所，三个月来帮助农民减轻了许多中间剥削，消除了旧社会城吃乡的恶习，这是新的城乡关系表现形式之一，值得各地推广。在华北基本上完全解放的今天，城乡的经济文化的交流，生产的相互促进相辅而行，实为刻不容缓之务，应当想出很多的办法来试验去做。最近有些城市医生下乡防疫灭瘟，学生下乡推广文化，都是非常好的措施。
    　　　　经济干部应注意检查思想
    经济部门干部掌握着国家财富及经济权力，必须时刻警惕自己，站稳立场，防止一切可能的外界引诱与溶化。对此，我们曾不断地揭发各种事实敲起警钟。太行人民银行最近开展干部思想检查是完全必要的，他们从检查中，确切认识了批评与自我批评这一武器的重要性。因为只有清除留在若干同志头脑中的资本主义思想影响，才能树立严格纪律，清醒头脑，完成党给予的学会作经济工作的任务。
