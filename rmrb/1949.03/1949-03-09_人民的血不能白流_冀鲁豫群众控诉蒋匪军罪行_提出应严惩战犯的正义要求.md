　　The People's Blood Cannot Be Shed in Vain
    The People of the Hebei-Shandong-Henan Region Accuse the Chiang Bandit Army of Crimes, Presenting the Just Demand for Severe Punishment of War Criminals
    [Hebei-Shandong-Henan Dispatch] The people in the vast area south of the Yellow River in Hebei-Shandong-Henan unanimously demand severe punishment for the war criminals headed by Chiang Kai-shek. After the Japanese surrender, Hebei-Shandong-Henan was a liberated area, and the vast majority of people were living a peaceful and prosperous life. However, in August 1946, Chiang Kai-shek ordered his reactionary troops to attack the people of Hebei-Shandong-Henan. Until the region was liberated again in September 1948, for over 770 days, the Chiang bandit army brutally murdered, raped, conscripted, and looted in the land south of the Yellow River, north of the Longhai Railway, west of the Grand Canal, and several hundred miles deep... creating an unprecedented blood debt to the people. In September, October, and November of 1946 alone, the Chiang bandit’s Fifth Army, Eleventh Division, Seventy-fifth Division, Eighty-eighth Division, and other units massacred over 11,000 people in the area west of Weishan Lake. This included 3,000 people each in Pei, Tong, and Feng counties, over 2,000 each in Jinxiang and Chengwu, 1,500 to 1,600 in Shan County, 400 to 500 in Yutai, and other counties such as Pei County, Huashan, Junan, Dangshan, and Shanyu were not yet included in the statistics. According to incomplete statistics from the first half of 1948, the enemy’s Fifth Army, Eighty-eighth Division, Forty-seventh Army, and the bandit units of Huang Botao, Sun Zhen, Liu Ruming, etc., in the 29 counties under the 2nd, 3rd, 5th, and 7th administrative offices, conscripted 38,441 men, seized over 7.2 million catties of grain, took away over 16,000 head of livestock, burned down over 32,000 houses, and stole 1,764 carts, 75,854 silver yuan, and countless other money, clothing, farm tools, and livestock. This deprived countless farmers of their means of production and livelihoods. In the spring of the same year, the bandit Fifth Army conscripted over 10,000 people in the first, fourth, and sixth districts of Yunbei, and the number of people conscripted in Qibin from January to April reached 15,000, forcing countless young people to serve as cannon fodder for the war criminals. The Chiang bandit army's methods of killing people were also extremely cruel and inhumane, with barbaric means such as "dismemberment by five oxen," "skinning," "heart extraction," and "live burial." More than 1,500 people in the urban area of Heze were brutally murdered. People still hate them to the core when they mention it today. The Chiang bandit army's acts of rape and bestiality enraged the people of the Hebei-Shandong-Henan region even more. Many women were brutally raped. Some women committed suicide out of grief and indignation after being violated, and their families wept as they collected their bodies. The bandit army everywhere looted the property of the people of the Hebei-Shandong-Henan region, even taking away the farmers' only tattered clothes and quilts. The 181st Brigade of the 68th Division, while at a market in Qianlongmiao Village, Qibin, forced more than 160 villagers to hand over money and grain, otherwise they would be beaten one by one. Elderly people were beaten to death, and the villagers' cries shook the heavens. In April last year, the bandit troops of the 84th Division killed 12 village cadres and civilians, including Ma Fengxing, in Xiaomazhuang, the 30-household village of the fifth district of the old city, burned 35 houses, and burned an old woman of 79 years old alive. Due to the serious destruction of labor, livestock, and farm tools by the Chiang bandits, nearly 300,000 mu of fertile land was left barren, and grain production was greatly reduced. Millions of people in Henan were trapped in a serious famine threat. Recently, at rallies throughout the region to celebrate the liberation of North China and Tianjin, people recalled these bloody facts of the past two years. This deep-seated hatred must be avenged. Therefore, they unanimously demanded that the Kuomintang reactionary group headed by Chiang Kai-shek and the reactionary army it drove be held accountable for this blood debt. The group of war criminals headed by Chiang Kai-shek must be severely punished and must repay the blood debt they owe.

    冀鲁豫群众控诉蒋匪军罪行  提出应严惩战犯的正义要求
    【冀鲁豫电】冀鲁豫黄河南岸广大地区的人民，一致要求严惩以蒋介石为首的战争罪犯。日本投降以后，冀鲁豫是已获得解放的区域，广大人民正在过着安居乐业的生活，但一九四六年八月，蒋介石即命令其反动军队进攻冀鲁豫人民，直到一九四八年九月重获解放，七百几十天中，蒋匪军在黄河以南、陇海路北、运河以西、纵深几百里的土地上，残酷的屠杀、奸淫、抓丁、焚掠………给人民造下了亘古未有的血债。一九四六年九、十、十一三个月里，蒋匪的第五军、十一师、七十五师、八十八师等部，在微山湖以西地区残杀人民达一万一千以上。计沛、铜、丰县各三千人、金乡、城武各二千余人，单县一千五、六百人，鱼台四，五百人，其他如沛县、华山、巨南、砀山、单虞等县尚未统计在内。据一九四八年上半年的不完全统计，敌第五军、八十八师、四十七军及黄伯韬、孙震、刘汝明等匪部在二、三、五、七等专署，廿九个县中，抓丁三万八千四百四十一人，抢粮七百廿万余斤，拉去牲口一万六千余头，焚毁房屋三万二千余间，抢走大车一千七百六十四辆，白银七万五千八百五十四元，其余钱财衣物、农具、家畜就没法计算。使无数农民失掉了自己的生产资料与生存的依托。同年春天，匪第五军在郓北一、四、六区抓人即有一万多，在齐滨一至四月被抓人数即达一万五千人，强迫无数青年为战犯们充当炮灰。匪军杀人方法之残酷，也惨绝人寰。有所谓“五牛分尸”、“扒皮”、“挖心”、“活埋”等野蛮手段。菏泽城区人民便有一千五百多人惨遭毒手。人们今天一提起来，就切齿愤恨。蒋匪军的奸淫兽行，更令冀鲁豫区的人民发指。许多妇女惨遭奸淫。有的妇女被辱后悲愤自杀，她们的家属流着泪收拾尸体。匪军到处对冀鲁豫人民的财产血洗一空，甚至连农民仅有的破衣破被，都给拾走。六十八师一八一旅在齐滨前龙庙村赶集，强令一百六十余村民，拿出钱、粮，否则逐一毒打，老年人被毒打至死，村人哭声震天。去年四月，八十四师匪部在老城五区卅户的小马庄，一次即杀死马逢兴等村干部和群众十二人，烧房卅五间，一位七十九岁的老妈妈被活活烧死。由于蒋匪对劳力牲畜农具等的严重摧毁破坏，致使近卅万亩的良田荒芜，粮食大量减产。河南数百万人民，便陷在严重的灾荒威胁之中。最近全区人民在庆祝华北和平津解放的集会中，回想起两年来这些血淋淋的事实，血海深仇，不报不休，因此，一致要求必须和以蒋介石为首的国民党反动集团及它所驱使的反动军队，清算这一笔血债，以蒋介石为首的一群战争罪犯，必须严惩，必须由他们来偿还所欠的血债。
