　　Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, 1st. The former staff of Tianjin Ta Kung Pao, realizing the reactionary essence of Ta Kung Pao, decided to cease publication of Ta Kung Pao and, in conjunction with journalists willing to serve the people, established the Progress Daily, which has been approved for registration by the Tianjin Military Control Commission. After several days of preparation, the newspaper was published on February 27th. Ta Kung Pao, in the era of the Northern Warlords, was attached to the warlord, bureaucratic, and comprador ruling clique; after Chiang Kai-shek came to power, it became the mouthpiece of the Kuomintang Political Science clique. For twenty years, the basic stance shown by Ta Kung Pao has been anti-people and anti-democratic. Therefore, the Tianjin staff of the newspaper decided to abandon this stinking name and adopt a new name.

　　In addition, the Tianjin Military Control Commission has tentatively approved the publication of the Tianjin New Life Daily, Bo Ling Daily, and Han Ying Daily respectively. The Bo Ling Daily resumed publication before the 12th. It is reported that the New Life Daily and Han Ying Daily will also resume publication soon.

　　抛弃前天津大公报臭招牌
    该报同人改创进步日报
    【新华社天津一日电】前天津大公报同人由于认识了大公报的反动实质，决定停办大公报，联合愿为人民服务的新闻工作者，创办进步日报，并已由天津市军管会准予登记。该报经多日之筹备，已于二月二十七日出版。按大公报在北洋军阀时代依附于军阀官僚买办统治集团；蒋匪介石当政以后，即为国民党政学系之机关报。二十年来，大公报所表现出来的基本立场是反人民反民主的，故该报天津同人决定抛弃这个臭名字，而改用新名。
    又：津市军管会对津市新生报、博陵报、汉英报均已分别暂允出版。博陵报已于十二日前复刊。据悉新生报、汉英报亦将于最近复刊。
