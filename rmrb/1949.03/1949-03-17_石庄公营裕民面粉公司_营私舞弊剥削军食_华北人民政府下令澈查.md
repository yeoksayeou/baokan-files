　　Shijiazhuang Publicly Operated Yumin Flour Company
  　Embezzles and Exploits Military Food Supplies
    North China People's Government Orders Thorough Investigation
    [Report from Our Correspondent] The Shijiazhuang Yumin Flour Company, disregarding its reputation, reduced the quality of flour and engaged in embezzlement and exploitation of military food supplies. This kind of terrible behavior directly impacted the work of supporting the front lines. The North China People's Government has ordered an investigation. Yumin Company is a public company of the people. In July, August, and September of last year, it signed a contract with the Shijiazhuang Supply Bureau to exchange wheat for flour. The main points of the contract were: 1. From July 1st to July 20th, the Supply Bureau would provide Yumin Company with 1,800,000 jin of wheat; by August 20th, it would deliver 1,200,000 jin of wheat, totaling 3,000,000 jin. For every 100 jin of wheat, 71 jin of ordinary flour would be exchanged for military use. The Supply Bureau would take the flour every ten days, each time not exceeding 220,000 jin. Both parties would keep samples of the wheat and flour and were not allowed to replace them. 2. If Yumin Company encountered losses due to force majeure (such as enemy bombing), it could report to the Supply Bureau. After verification, the Supply Bureau would be responsible. During the execution of the contract, the Supply Bureau did not deliver the wheat on time because it did not need all the flour at that time. By July 20th, 1,500,000 jin of wheat had been delivered, and on August 10th, 115,000 jin were delivered. Therefore, a verbal agreement was made with Yumin Company to extend the contract by one month. By October, due to urgent military needs, another 459,850 jin of wheat were delivered. However, at this time, Yumin Company did not provide flour on time. In order to obtain more profit, the company violated the contract and secretly extracted 30,000 jin of high-quality flour from the ordinary flour and sold it to the Daxing Textile Mill, thereby reducing the quality of the ordinary flour. The troops all reported that the flour supplied by Yumin Company was too bad. After the Supply Bureau sent people to Yumin Company to inquire, the extraction was stopped. When the situation of preparing for war in Shijiazhuang arrived, Yumin Company, under the pretext of this being a danger of force majeure, returned 385,455 jin out of the 800,000 jin of wheat delivered by the Supply Bureau for settlement, and sold more than 400,000 jin of wheat in Shijiazhuang and Dezhou on its own. At that time, the selling price was 360 yuan per jin, but by December, the price of wheat had risen to 550 yuan per jin. Yumin Company proposed that the Supply Bureau bear this loss, but the Supply Bureau did not agree, resulting in a dispute. This kind of terrible behavior by Yumin Company completely violated the proper stance and attitude of a public enterprise. When the Supply Bureau discovered that Yumin Company had extracted high-quality flour, it failed to promptly investigate and correct its mistake, resulting in a waste of manpower and material resources and affecting support for the front lines. This irresponsible attitude should also be reviewed. After the problem occurred, neither party promptly requested instructions or reported it, which is a serious manifestation of anarchy and lack of discipline. The North China People's Government has criticized the above two organizations and ordered Liu Geng, the Supervisory Commissioner of the Shijiazhuang Municipal Government, to thoroughly investigate the details of Yumin Company's embezzlement and report it to the North China People's Government for verification and handling.

　　石庄公营裕民面粉公司
  　营私舞弊剥削军食
    华北人民政府下令澈查
    【本报专访】石家庄裕民面粉公司不顾信誉，降低粉质，营私舞弊，剥削军食，此种恶劣作风直接影响了支援前线工作，华北人民政府已下令查办。裕民公司是人民之公营公司，去年七、八、九三个月份，曾与石庄供应局订立以小麦换面粉之合同，其合同的内容要点是：一、供应局自七月一日至二十日交给裕民公司小麦一百八十万斤，至八月二十日交付小麦一百二十万斤，共三百万斤，以小麦每百斤换通粉七十一斤，供给军用，供应局每十天取面一次，每次不超过二十二万斤，双方均持有麦样粉样，不得更换。二、裕民公司如遇人力不能抵抗之损失（如敌机轰炸），可报请供应局，审核属实后，由供应局负责。在合同执行过程中，供应局由于当时不需要全部面粉，未按期交麦。至七月二十日交麦一百五十万斤，八月十日交麦十一万五千斤，遂与裕民公司口头约定延长合同一个月。至十月份因军需甚急，又交出小麦四十五万九千八百五十斤，但此时裕民公司却不按期给予面粉，该公司为更多的取得利润，竟违背合同，私从面粉中提取特粉三万斤卖给大兴纱厂，因而降低了通粉质量，部队均反映裕民公司供应的面粉太坏，经供应局派人至裕民公司查问后，始停止提取。当石家庄备战情况到来的时候，裕民公司又借口这是人力不可抵抗之危险，将供应局交来收帐之小麦八十万斤送回三十八万五千四百五十五斤，并自行在石家庄德州两地出卖小麦四十余万斤，当时卖价三百六十元一斤，至十二月份麦价已涨至五百五十元一斤，此中亏损，裕民公司提出由供应局负担，供应局不同意，因而发生争执。裕民公司此种恶劣作风，完全违背了公营企业应有的立场与态度，供应局发现裕民公司提取特粉时，未能及时追究，纠正其错误，以致浪费了人力物力，影响了支援前线，这种不负责任的态度，也是应该检讨的。问题发生后，双方均未及时请示报告，更是无政府无纪律的严重表现。华北人民政府对以上两机关已提出批评，并令石庄市政府监察专员刘绠对裕民公司之舞弊详情切实澈查呈报华北人民政府核办。
