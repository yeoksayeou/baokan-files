　　All-China Federation of Trade Unions Issues Declaration
    Calling for the Defense of World Peace
    Resolves to Send Delegates to the World Congress for the Defence of Peace
    [Our Dispatch] The All-China Federation of Trade Unions issued a declaration yesterday (22nd), calling on the working class and patriotic compatriots of the whole country to unite and defend world peace. The full text is as follows:
    Comrades of the working class, patriotic compatriots throughout the country:
    The international aggressive camp headed by American imperialism is plotting and preparing for a new world war. The North Atlantic Treaty, which is about to be signed, is in essence a military alliance with aggression as its goal by these international imperialist executioners. All peace-loving forces in the world have been mobilized to overthrow this heinous plot. Recently, the International Liaison Committee of the World Congress of Intellectuals for Peace, the Women's International Democratic Federation, and renowned scientists and artists from various countries jointly issued a declaration calling on the people of all countries to combat the warmongers and suggesting that a World Congress for the Defence of Peace be held in April of this year. This call has been enthusiastically responded to by people's organizations in various countries.
    We believe that the struggle between the warmongers and the peace advocates, the struggle between the imperialist aggressive front and the anti-imperialist peace front, is related to the fate of all mankind, and no one can claim to be "neutral" on this matter. We, the Chinese people, we, the Chinese working class, have suffered bitterly from the Kuomintang counter-revolutionary war manufactured by American imperialism, and are still suffering from the aggression of American imperialism. We must firmly stand on the side of the anti-imperialist camp headed by the Soviet Union and the international proletariat. There must be no wavering on this point.
    We believe that the war plot of American imperialism can be completely defeated, and that American imperialism is a paper tiger. Although the American government has provided the Kuomintang government with various military and economic aid, the whole world has seen that it is not the Kuomintang government supported by American imperialism that has won, but the Chinese people who oppose American imperialism. As long as the people of all countries in the world, especially the working classes of all countries, can unite and fight, the American imperialists will never realize their dream of aggressive war.
    Our All-China Federation of Trade Unions has decided to send its own representatives to attend the World Congress for the Defence of Peace. We hope that the opinions of the workers of the whole country on opposing aggressive war and defending world peace can be submitted to us as soon as possible; at the same time, we hope that other people's organizations and cultural workers can also quickly send their own representatives so that they can travel together to represent the Chinese people to participate in this great conference.

　　中华全国总工会发表宣言
    号召保卫世界和平
    决派遣代表出席世界拥护和平大会
    【本报讯】中华全国总工会，于昨（二十二）日发表宣言，号召全国工人阶级及爱国同胞，共同起来保卫世界和平，其原文如下：全国工友们，爱国同胞们：
    以美帝国主义为首的国际侵略阵营，正在阴谋准备新的世界战争。最近即将签订的北大西洋公约，实质上便是这些国际帝国主义刽子手以侵略为目标的军事同盟。全世界爱好和平的力量，已经动员起来打倒这种穷凶极恶的阴谋。最近世界文化工作者保卫和平大会国际联络委员会、国际民主妇女联合会、以及各国著名的科学工作者、艺术工作者，联合发表宣言，号召各国人民打击战争挑拨者，并建议在今年四月召开世界拥护和平大会。这个号召，已经得到各国人民团体的热烈响应。
    我们认为：挑拨战争者和拥护和平者之间的斗争，帝国主义的侵略阵线和反帝国主义的和平阵线之间的斗争，关系着全人类的命运，任何人可不能对此表示“中立”。我们中国人民，我们中国工人阶级，曾经饱受美帝国主义所制造的国民党反革命战争的痛苦，现在也还受着美帝国主义的侵略，必须坚决站在以苏联和国际无产阶级为首的反帝国主义阵营方面。对于这一点，决不能够有丝毫的动摇。
    我们相信：美帝国主义的战争阴谋是完全可以打倒的，美帝国主义是一只纸老虎。美国政府虽然给国民党政府以种种军事援助和经济援助，但是全世界都看到了，胜利的并不是美帝国主义所扶持的国民党政府，而是反对美国帝国主义的中国人民。只要全世界各国人民首先是各国工人阶级能够团结奋斗，美帝国主义者决不能实现他们的侵略战争的梦想。
    我们全国总工会决定派遣自己的代表去出席世界拥护和平大会。我们希望全国工友关于反对侵略战争拥护世界和平的意见，能够早日提交给我们；同时希望其他人民团体和文化工作者，也能够迅速派出自己的代表，以便共同前往，代表中国人民来参加这个伟大的会议。
    　　　　　　　　　　　　　　中华全国总工会　　三月二十二日
