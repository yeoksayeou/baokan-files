【Jinan Electric】The Handan City Electric Light Company, Flour Company, and Chemical Pharmaceutical Factory have jointly established a workers' cooperative to organize textile production by the families of workers and provide affordable daily necessities. These three state-owned factories have a total of more than 170 employees, most of whom have families. To solve the production difficulties of all employees' families, the leaders of the three factories discussed and studied the matter in January and established the three-factory workers' cooperative. They jointly raised more than 70,000 yuan in funds, specializing in the sale of daily necessities such as oil, salt, rice, and flour, and selling them to employees at prices lower than the market price. For example, if an employee uses 58 jin and 12 liang of wheat each month, they can exchange it for a bag of flour (44 jin), which saves about 200 yuan compared to buying it on the market. In order to organize the families of employees to participate in production, the cooperative recently purchased a large quantity of raw cotton and lent it to them as capital for spinning. It is stipulated that for every jin of homespun thread spun, two jin and two liang of raw cotton can be exchanged at the cooperative. The flour company also advanced 2,000 yuan to order fifteen spinning wheels and lent them to the families of employees; and sent people to buy looms, preparing to weave the spun thread into white cloth and sew it into flour bags for the company to use. Currently, the cooperative has organized more than 100 family members to participate in spinning and weaving, and has issued 400 jin of raw cotton. The spinning wheels made on behalf of the flour company have already been issued, and the remaining ones are being rushed to be made by carpenters. After being organized in this way, the families of the employees are all very happy. For example, Shi Huaizhi, a technician at the flour company, organized two spinning groups and actively helped those who did not know how to spin to repair their wheels and teach them how to spin. The wife of Mi Diankui, a wire-drawing worker in the machine repair shop, brought her two-month-old child and also received a spinning wheel and cotton. She said, "Currently, our family's life is not very good. We used to buy oil and vinegar with a small bowl, but now we have saved six bags of flour. Buying things at the cooperative is also cheaper, and we buy two or three jin of oil at a time. Life is much better now!"

　　邯郸电灯、面粉等公司联合成立职工合作社
    【冀南电】邯郸市电灯、面粉公司及化学制药厂，联合成立职工合作社，组织职工家属纺织，供给廉价日用品。上述三国营工厂共职工一百七十多人，大部分职工都带有家眷。三个工厂的领导上为了解决全体职工家属生产困难，在一月份经过讨论研究，开办了三厂职工合作社。由三个工厂共同筹借了七万余元资金，专门经售油、盐、米面等日用必需品，并低于市价卖与职工。如职工每月用五十八斤十二两麦子，就可换到一袋面粉（四十四斤），比到市场买能省二百元左右。该社为了组织职工家属参加生产，最近买到大批净棉，借给他们作纺花本钱。规定纺一斤土线，可到社内换二斤二两净棉。面粉公司厂方又垫出二千元，订制了十五辆纺车，借给职工家属使用；并派人去买织布机，准备把纺的线子织成白布，缝成粉袋供公司使用。现该社已组织一百多名家属参加纺织，发出净棉四百斤。面粉公司代制的纺车已发出四辆，下余的正让木工赶制。这样组织起来以后，各职工家属都很高兴。如面粉公司技师师怀志的老婆组织了两个纺花组，并积极帮助不会纺的收拾车子，教他们纺。修机房拉丝工人米殿魁的老婆，带着两月的小孩，也领了纺车和棉花，她说：“目前俺家里日子过得不太好，打油买醋都是端着小碗，如今俺光白面就存了六袋，上合作社买东西又便宜，打油一次就是两三斤，日子可好过了！”
