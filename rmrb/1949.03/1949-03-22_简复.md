　　Brief Replies
    To Mr. Lin Yaohua: The problem you raised has been forwarded to the Yangquan Municipal Government for research and resolution. Regarding the second issue: the lack of cultural and recreational activities in Yangquan is indeed worthy of attention. You can also directly suggest improvements to the Municipal Government. However, given that everything is just beginning, improvements will take some time. Furthermore, cultural and recreational activities include many forms besides theater and film. You can also suggest or organize, through the government, various amateur cultural and recreational activities to compensate for the inadequacy of cultural and recreational activities in Yangquan. The results of the encirclement and annihilation of Du Yuming's bandit troops have already been published. Please refer to the first page of the 246th issue of this newspaper, dated February 19th.
    To Mr. Lian Jie: Regarding your question about renting property, we are unable to provide a specific answer because your letter is too brief, and we do not understand your specific situation. We have forwarded your question to the Anping County Government for handling. Please negotiate directly with the Anping County Government.
    To Mr. Xu Zhi: Regarding the confiscation of your silver dollar, we have sent a letter to the relevant authorities for inquiry. We will inform you of the details after receiving their response.

　　简复
    林耀华君：你所提出的问题，已转阳泉市府研究解决，关于第二个问题：阳泉缺乏文化娱乐工作，确是值得重视的，你们亦可直接建议市府加以改进，唯目前百废待举，改进还得一些时间，同时文娱工作除戏剧电影外，还有别的许多形式，你们还可建议或通过政府组织各种业余性质的文化娱乐活动，以补救阳泉市文娱工作之不足。关于围歼杜聿明匪部的战果早已发表，可参看本报二月十九日第二四六期第一版即可。
    连捷君：你提租赁房产问题，因来信太简单，对你们的具体情况不了解，无法作具体解答。你的问题我们已代转安平县府处理，望直接去安平县府交涉。
    续志君：你卖银元一块被没收，我们已去信有关机关查询，详情俟来信后再告你。
