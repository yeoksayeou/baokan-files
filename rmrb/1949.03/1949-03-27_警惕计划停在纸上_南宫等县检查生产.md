　　Jinan Telegram: In order to implement the planting of economic crops plan, Guangzong, Nangong, and other counties conducted inspections to resolve ideological problems among cadres. The inspection results in the fifth district of Guangzong showed a significant discrepancy with the assigned tasks. The reason was that the district cadres did not have a sufficient understanding of this task. They superficially called production the central task, but in reality, they were busy with other work, neglecting production leadership, and failing to conduct in-depth publicity and education among the masses. The masses still had concerns such as fear that cotton would not be worth much in the fall, resulting in phenomena such as over-reporting or falsely reporting planting numbers to cope with the task, while actually being unwilling to plant more. Based on this situation, the district committee conducted in-depth research and re-deployed the task, emphasizing the need to seize the production season and mobilize the masses in depth. Leading through the example of branch party members and village cadres, the masses were to be encouraged to voluntarily accept the production plan under possible conditions. Village cadres were clearly assigned responsibilities, with the farmers' association responsible for leading production and the village office responsible for tasks such as war service. After seven days, the entire district exceeded the task. The original plan was to plant 50,000 mu of cotton, 3,700 mu of peanuts, and 3,000 mu of sesame. The actual results were that cotton and peanuts each exceeded the plan by more than 200 mu, and sesame exceeded the plan by 798 mu. The Nangong County Committee convened a meeting of cadres from four districts to conduct inspections and found that some district cadres were not settled in their work, and some simply considered the task complete after assigning the figures, causing the plan to become a mere formality. The County Committee immediately mobilized the cadres and re-deployed the task. The seventh district of Guan County convened 200 village cadres to inspect the planting plan, commended those who completed the task, and educated those village cadres who believed that production did not need leadership and simply turned in numbers to cope with the task. Combining the issuance of land certificates with continued mobilization of the masses, they broke the concerns about equal distribution and fear that cotton would not be worth much in the fall. Similar phenomena also exist in other areas, which has attracted the attention of leadership organs at all levels for inspection and continued ideological mobilization of the masses.

　　警惕计划停在纸上
  　南宫等县检查生产
    【冀南电】为贯彻实现种植经济作物计划，广宗、南宫等县进行检查，解决干部思想问题。广宗五区检查结果与布置任务相差甚远，原因是区干部对此任务认识不足，空喊生产是中心任务，实际上忙于别的工作，忽视生产领导，未能向群众进行深入的宣传教育，群众仍存有怕秋后棉花不值钱等顾虑，因而产生多报或假报种植数目，应付任务，实际上不愿多种的现象。据此情况，区委作了深刻的研讨，并重新布置，强调抓紧生产季节，深入群众动员，通过支部党员及村干带头领导，使群众在可能条件下自愿接受生产计划。村干部明确分工，农会负责领导生产，村公所负责战勤等工作。七天后，全区超过任务，原计划种棉五万亩，花生三千七百亩，芝麻三千亩，结果棉花、花生均超过二百多亩，芝麻超过七百九十八亩。南宫县委会召集了四个区的干部开会检查，发现有些区干部工作不安心，有的把数目字布置分配后就百事大吉，致使计划流于形式。县委当即动员干部，重新布置。冠县七区召集村干部二百人检查种植计划，对完成任务的进行表扬，针对有些村干认为生产不用领导的思想，单纯交数字应付任务的观点进行教育，结合发土地证继续向群众动员，打破怕平分，怕秋后棉花不值钱等顾虑。其他地区亦有类似现象，已引起各级领导机关注意检查，继续向群众进行思想动员。
