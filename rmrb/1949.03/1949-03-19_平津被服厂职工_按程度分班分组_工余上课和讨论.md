Tianjin Garment Factory Employees
　　Grouped by Proficiency Level for After-Work Classes and Discussions

[This Newspaper's Report] To improve their cultural and political level, the employees of the sewing departments and quilting factories affiliated with the Tianjin Garment Factory have begun to study during production breaks. The First Sewing Department established a staff study group on the 14th, with more than 380 people signing up and divided into study groups. The Second Sewing Department's staff study group was established on the 15th. In the first week, there were two special lectures and four discussion meetings, mainly discussing wage issues and cooperative issues. Afterwards, classes were held according to cultural level, divided into advanced and beginner classes. The Third Sewing Department's study group has also started, with classes divided into advanced, intermediate, and beginner levels. Out of the factory's 416 employees, almost all participated, except for a few with special difficulties. The Fourth Sewing Department's study group was also recently established, with employees participating in the study accounting for four-fifths of the total number of people, divided into groups, with workers with higher education serving as group leaders. The Tianqiao Quilting Factory study group was established on the 13th, with classes divided according to work department. Other locations such as the Heta Temple Quilting Factory and the Yangshi Street Quilting Factory have also established study groups. The study time is generally from 12:30 to 1:30 PM or 1:00 to 1:30 PM, which does not affect production. In addition to literacy, the study content generally includes explanations or discussions of workers' movement literature, the Chinese working class and the Chinese Communist Party, the new work attitude, the Eight-Point Agreement, and materials related to the workers' movement or production movement published in the newspaper. On the day the First Sewing Department's study group opened, some workers were waiting in the classroom before class time, and some were holding cornbread in their hands. They said, "The Kuomintang oppressed us and did not allow us to study; now that we have the opportunity, we must study hard." Some workers are eager to improve their political understanding. In addition to actively participating in study groups, the employees of the Tianjin Garment Factory have also organized communication groups, published mimeographed small newspapers, and learned to write. Or they organized reading groups and often discussed current affairs. Out of the 361 employees in the Fourth Sewing Department, 114 subscribed to the People's Daily. The workers in the First, Second, and Third Sewing Departments have also established libraries. When wages were paid on the 15th, 136 workers from the Third Sewing Department voluntarily took out 20 to 40 yuan each and gave it to the workers' preparatory committee to buy new books and enrich their own library.
