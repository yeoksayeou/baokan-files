　　Ping City “People’s Youth” League Members
    1,700 People Victoriously Meet
    Comrade Feng Wenbin Speaks on Issues of Establishing the League
    [Our Newspaper] Under the leadership and auspices of the Preparatory Committee of the Chinese New Democratic Youth League of Beiping City, more than 1,700 members of the revolutionary youth organizations "Democratic Youth League" and "Democratic Youth Alliance" from major middle schools in Ping City (excluding Peking University, Tsinghua University, Yenching University, and Normal University) held their first league member meeting since liberation yesterday (the 22nd) at the National Grand Theater. Feng Wenbin, from the Preparatory Committee of the National Congress of the Chinese New Democratic Youth League, attended and reported on several issues concerning the establishment of the new youth league, and Zhao Yimin, Minister of Propaganda of the Beiping Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, reported that the important task of young students is to study. After the meeting, the Soviet films "The Rainbow" and "Zoya" were screened to entertain all league members.
    The meeting was attended by league members from 78 units, including specialized and higher education institutions and secondary schools such as China-France University, Railway Management College, Huizhong Girls' High School, Huiwen Middle School, the Girls' High School Affiliated to Normal University, and Bridgman Academy. Before liberation, they were in a long-term secret environment under reactionary rule, scattered and working hard. Today, after liberation, comrades-in-arms who had fought side by side finally met victoriously. Seeing their own growing ranks, they were all filled with excitement.
    Comrade Zhao Yimin first gave a detailed exposition on the current domestic and international situation, and then pointed out that the central task of today's young students is to study. They must learn and master culture, science, and technology in order to manage and build the city and develop production. Comrade Feng Wenbin raised several basic questions about building the league: (1) The purpose of establishing the new youth league is to unite and educate the entire young generation. To complete the arduous task of building a new democratic country, there must be a core organization of advanced youth to promote the study and production work of the broad masses of young people. In addition to liberating all of China and building a new society, the new youth league also has the greater goal of liberating all of mankind. (2) The establishment of the new youth league should be carried out openly, because the new youth league is an upright organization that serves the masses. Every league member must be a model for the masses, determined to correct their mistakes under the supervision of everyone, so that they can become true servants of the working people and good students of Chairman Mao.

　　平市“民青”盟员
    千七百人胜利会合
    冯文彬同志讲建团问题
    【本报讯】在中国新民主主义青年团北平市筹委会的领导与主持下，平市各大中学（除北京大学、清华大学、燕京大学、师范大学外）革命青年组织“民主青年同盟”“民主青年联盟”盟员一千七百余人，昨（二十二）日在国民大戏院召开解放后第一次盟员大会。有中国新民主主义青年团全国代表大会筹委冯文彬出席报告关于建立新青团的几个问题，及中国共产党北平市委员会宣传部长赵毅敏报告青年学生重要的任务在于学习。会后放映苏联名片“虹”及“丹娘”，招待全体盟员。
    到会的有中法大学、铁道管理学院、惠中女中、汇文中学、师大女附中、贝满女中等专科以上及中等学校共七十八个单位的盟员，他们在解放前在反动统治下处于长期的秘密环境中，各自分散，艰苦工作，解放后的今日，一向并肩作战的战友，胜利会师了，他们见到了自己如此壮大的队伍，都满怀兴奋。
    赵毅敏同志先就目前国内外局势作了详尽的阐述，然后指出今日青年学生的中心任务在于学习。要学习掌握文化，科学技术，以便管理与建设城市，发展生产。冯文彬同志提出关于建团的几个基本问题：（一）建立新青团之目的在于团结与教育整个青年一代，要完成建设新民主主义国家的艰巨任务必须要有先进青年的核心组织，来推动广大青年的学习与生产工作。新青团除了解放全中国建设新社会外，还有着解放全人类的更远大的目标。（二）建立新青团要公开进行，因为新青团是正大光明的为群众服务的组织，每个团员要做群众的模范，在大家的监督下决心改正自己错误，这样才能成为真正为劳动人民服务的勤务员和毛主席的好学生。
