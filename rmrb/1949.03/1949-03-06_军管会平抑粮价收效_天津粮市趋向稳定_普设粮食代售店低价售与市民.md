Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, 4th: Under the correct measures of the Tianjin Military Control Commission's Trade Department, the grain market here has tended towards stability. Since the middle of last month, Tianjin's grain prices once rose. The main reason was that at the beginning of Tianjin's liberation, grain prices were lower than those in areas along the Jinpu and Pinghan lines. The amount of grain entering the market gradually decreased from late January to early February, and grain storage households were also unwilling to sell. In addition, speculative merchants took the opportunity to operate, which led to the increase in grain prices. The price of wheat at the beginning of the month was only 1,000 yuan per shi (a unit of dry measure) (People's Currency, same below), but by the 15th, it suddenly rose to 1,500 yuan per shi. At this time, the Grain and Oil Department of the Trade Department sold a large amount at 1,300 yuan, and the market price then tended to stabilize. Since the latter ten days of the month, the prices of coarse and fine grains have continued to rise, and there is a trend of affecting grain price fluctuations in nearby towns. After careful study, the Trade Department decided to adopt a comprehensive stabilization policy. On the 23rd, the opening price of flour was 1,400 yuan per bag, and the Grain and Oil Department of the Trade Department immediately released a large batch of flour at 1,300 yuan, causing the flour price to quickly fall back to 1,290 yuan, and on the 24th, it fell to 1,100 yuan. When the opening price of corn on the 23rd reached more than 12 yuan per jin (a unit of weight), after two days of stabilization, the market price had fallen to 9.5 yuan, and various miscellaneous grains also fell one after another. Due to this quick and reasonable measure, the market quickly moved towards stability, powerfully打击打击投机商人 [打击投机商人] striking a blow against speculative merchants. The Trade Department has successively transferred large quantities of grain from North China and Northeast China to Tianjin to regulate the market. The first batch of more than one million jin of miscellaneous grains from the Northeast has now arrived. For the convenience of citizens, the Trade Department has specially set up 84 grain consignment shops in the city, specializing in retail sales, with prices lower than the market price.

　　军管会平抑粮价收效
    天津粮市趋向稳定
  　普设粮食代售店低价售与市民
    【新华社天津四日电】在天津市军事管制委员会贸易处正确措施下，此间粮食市场已趋向稳定。上月中旬以来津市粮价曾一度上涨，主要原因系津市解放之初，粮价低于津浦线及平汉线各地，入市粮食自一月下旬至二月上旬逐渐减少，存粮户亦不愿出售，加以投机商人趁机活动，遂使粮价上升。麦价在上月初每市石仅千元（人民币，下同），至十五日则突然高升至每市石一千五百元，此时，贸易处粮油部即按一千三百元大量出售，市价方趋稳定。下旬以来粗细粮价格又继续上升，且有影响附近城镇粮价波动的趋向，贸易处经缜密研究，决定采取全面平抑的方针。二十三日面粉价开牌每袋一千四百元，贸易处粮油部即按一千三百元抛出大批面粉，使面价迅速回落至一千二百九十元，二十四日又落至一千一百元。二十三日玉米开牌时每斤曾达十二元以上，经两日平抑，市价已落至九元五角，各种杂粮亦纷纷回落。由于此种敏捷而合理的措施，使市场很快走向稳定，有力地打击了投机商人。贸易处已陆续自华北、东北各地大批调运粮食来津，以资调剂市场。现东北首批杂粮百余万斤已运达。为便利市民计，贸易处特在市内设立粮食代售店八十四处，专营零售，价格较市面为低。
