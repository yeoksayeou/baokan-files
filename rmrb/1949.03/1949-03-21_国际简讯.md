　　The Dutch government, in order to fulfill the obligations stipulated in the aggressive Brussels Pact, is now planning to increase the annual conscription quota from 40,000 to 50,000. (Agence France-Presse)

　　According to the Belgian Communist Party's newspaper "Red Flag," the Belgian government intends to build ten new air force squadrons, including 240 aircraft, in the near future. The Belgian government has allocated 350 million francs to purchase the first batch of aircraft for this purpose. (TASS)

　　The Danish financial magazine "Financial News" pointed out that under the so-called "aid" of the Marshall Plan, the total amount of Denmark's national bank's foreign debt has increased from 553 million kroner at the end of 1948 to 602 million kroner on March 8. This figure shows that half of the funds stored last year have been lost. The reason is that the trade deficit is too large (TASS).
