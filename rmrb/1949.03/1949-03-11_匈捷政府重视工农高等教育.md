　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, March 9th: According to a report from the Electric Communications Agency: The Hungarian and Czechoslovak governments emphasize the issue of higher education for workers and peasants. Hungarian Minister of Education, Atutai, recently declared: Ten thousand young workers and peasants will receive scholarships this year to pursue university education. The Hungarian People's Republic will provide young workers and peasants with every opportunity to receive university education because the government fully understands the importance of the working class in building socialism.
    The first September training class, established to prepare one thousand workers for advanced university studies, began classes last month in Haustiga, near Prague, the capital of Czechoslovakia. Professor Mukarovsky, President of Charles University, said: Czechoslovak universities need workers. Czech Minister of Education Nizhdli said: Due to the new conditions, education is no longer limited to the children of the middle class.

　　匈捷政府重视工农高等教育
    【新华社陕北九日电】据电通社报导：匈牙利与捷克斯洛伐克政府重视使工农受高等教育的问题。匈牙利教育部长阿图泰最近宣称：一万名青年工人和农民今年将获得奖学金受大学教育。匈牙利人民共和国将予工农青年以受大学教育的一切机会，因为政府完全了解工人阶级在建设社会主义中的重要性。
    为一千名工人准备入大学深造而设立的第一个九月训练班，已于月前在捷京布拉格附近的豪斯蒂加开学。查里士大学校长穆卡罗夫斯基教授说：捷克斯洛伐克各大学需要工人们。捷教育部长尼兹德利说：由于新的条件，受教育的不再限于中等阶级的子弟了。
