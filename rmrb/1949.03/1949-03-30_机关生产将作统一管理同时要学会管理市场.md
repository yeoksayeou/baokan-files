To the Editor:

Why aren't government-run stores (i.e., stores remaining after the clearance of former government production) managed uniformly? Comrades engaged in public economic work unanimously reflect this issue: Why have government-run stores been under the management of various agency liquidation committees for more than eight months without proper handling? Continuing this way has many drawbacks: First, government-run stores lack unified leadership, resulting in inconsistent action plans; Second, leading agencies are mostly staffed by responsible comrades concurrently holding positions, who often lack the time to manage this work regularly; Third, most of the comrades previously assigned to this work were older cadres transferred from government agencies. These cadres have made new innovations in their work but have nowhere to report them. Consequently, some cadres can only guard their small assets and have no interest in making new research and creations; Fourth, some stores have too many cadres, more than they can use, but they must be kept, wasting manpower and hindering work development. We hope the editor will provide a reply in the newspaper.

　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　Sincerely,
　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　Xiansheng Xiansheng

Mr. Xiansheng:

In the past, some government-run factories and stores, for the sake of departmental interests, pursued market profits, providing opportunities for speculative merchants, even colluding with merchants to disrupt the market and cause price fluctuations. Furthermore, the lack of unified government production across various units led to competitive profiteering. To address this, the North China People's Government and the Ministry of Industry and Commerce previously issued orders and instructions to various localities (all published in the People's Daily) stipulating the tasks of government production and its future management policies. Recently, various localities have been rectifying this matter and will strive to achieve unified management, so that it not only works hard to improve supply but also complies with policies and laws, and cooperates with state-owned trading agencies to fight against speculators who fluctuate the market. (Reports from the Hebei-Shandong-Henan and Taiyue regions have been reported, see this newspaper on the 25th.) After unified management, cadres who previously managed government production, if not needed, can be transferred to other departments. Those who remain in their original positions should not merely "guard small assets," but more importantly, learn economic work, learn to fight against speculators, learn to stabilize prices, and manage the market, so that people's lives are not threatened by the speculative manipulation of unscrupulous merchants.

### 机关生产将作统一管理同时要学会管理市场

专栏：

　　机关生产将作统一管理同时要学会管理市场编辑同志：
    公营商店（即以前机关生产清理后所留存的商店）为何不统一经营呢？在从事公营经济工作的同志，都异口同声的反映这个问题：为什么公营商店归各机关清委会管理，已达八个多月，还没适当处理呢？这样下去有许多缺点：一、公营商店由于领导不统一，行动计划也不一致；二、领导机关多是各单位负责同志兼职，对此工作常无暇经常管理；三、过去用在这方面工作的同志大部是从机关里抽调的较老的干部，这些干部在工作中有了新的创造，也无处呈报。因而也使一些干部只能看守小家当，无兴趣作新的研究和创造；四、有的商店干部多，用不了，也得保存不动，既浪费了人力，也妨碍工作发展。希望编辑同志，给予登报答复。
    　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　先声先声先生：
    过去某些机关生产厂店，为了本位利益，追逐市场利润，予投机商人以可乘之隙，甚至串通商人，捣乱市场，波动物价。加以各单位之机关生产不统一，形成争相渔利。为此，华北人民政府及工商部前曾向各地发出命令和指示（均已登在人民日报）规定机关生产之任务及其今后的经营方针，近日各地都在整顿这件事情，将来都要做到统一管理，使其不仅为改善供给而努力，且应服从政策法令，配合国营贸易机关共同向波动市场的投机者作斗争。（冀鲁豫、太岳两区已有报导，见二十五日本报。）对过去经营机关生产的干部，在统一管理之后，如用不了，可调往其他部门工作，仍留在原来工作岗位，应不只是“看守小家当”，更重要的是学习经济工作，要学会与投机者作斗争，学会稳定物价，管理市场，使人民生活不受奸商投机操纵的威胁。
