[Jinan Telegram] Farmers in Qinghe County have completed manure delivery and harrowing ahead of schedule, and are engaging in intense spring plowing. Last winter, the Party and government leading organs of the county led farmers in making preparations for increased production, including purchasing livestock, farm tools, and accumulating fertilizer. Before the Lunar New Year, Sun Village bought eleven head of cattle. The farmers confidently said, "This is the capital for increased production!" Yuan Zhen's flour mill in Jijiagou accumulated one hundred cartloads of good manure over the winter. Li Huying invited a blacksmith, and every household repaired their farm tools. Due to thorough and timely preparations, farmers in various villages began production activities such as delivering manure and harrowing in advance in the middle of the first lunar month. Jie Mingliang from Jiazhuang delivered thirty cartloads of old house soil to the fields. Jie Tangshi and Gu Jieshi, who did not have oxen, also took advantage of the frozen ground and idle livestock to borrow oxen and quickly finish delivering manure. The entire village has now delivered more than 1,500 large cartloads. At the same time, the masses in various villages are actively leveling road ditches and improving alkaline land. In the Zhao Zhuang and Xipan Zhuang area, more than 30 villages and 2,310 young people filled in the road ditches (dug during the Anti-Japanese War) in the entire area in two days, turning them into several hundred hectares of fertile land. Calculated at 100 jin of grain per mu, this could increase production by 10,000 jin. Shenjiazhuang improved 120 mu of alkaline land. Currently, the entire county has completed manure delivery and harrowing, and is now engaged in intense spring plowing and making plans for planting cotton.

　　清河完成送粪耙地
  　刻正计划大力植棉
    【冀南电】清河县农民提前完成送粪、耙地，紧张进行春耕。该县党政领导机关去冬曾领导农民进行增产准备，添买牲口、农具、积肥等。孙庄旧历年前买了十一头牛，农民们信心十足的说：“这算有了增产的本钱！”纪家洼元贞的粉房，一冬汇了一百车好粪。李胡营请来一个铁匠，家家户户修理农具。由于准备充分与及时，阴历正月中旬各村农民都开始提前送粪、耙地等生产活动。解家庄解明良往地里送了卅车旧房土。没牛的解唐氏、顾解氏等也趁地冻牲口闲，赶紧借牛送完粪，现全村已送了一千五百多大车。与此同时，各村群众又积极平路沟、改良碱地。赵庄、西潘庄一带三十余村，两千三百一十名青年，两天填平全区的路沟（抗日时期所掘），变成良田几百顷，以每亩收百斤粮计，则可增产一万斤。沈家庄改良碱地一百二十亩。目下，全县已完成送粪、耙地，刻正在紧张进行春耕，和作种棉计划。
