Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, March 13th: The Northeast Federation of Trade Unions, to commend the employees of the Huangguantun Railway Factory in Shenyang for repairing the "Beiping" locomotive, recently made a decision to award them the title of "New Labor Model."

The decision pointed out: After the liberation of various places in Southern Manchuria, workers throughout the region actively participated in movements such as protecting factories, resuming work, improving tools, and increasing production, taking on the attitude of masters. The workers of the Huangguantun Railway Factory in Shenyang, in order to support the Northeast People's Liberation Army in their victorious entry into the pass and strive for the early victory of the national revolution, initiated a campaign to repair two more locomotives in addition to completing the January production plan, one of which was named "Beiping" to celebrate the liberation of the people of Beiping. This significant competition began vividly in the new wave of labor enthusiasm after liberation and relatively concentratedly embodied the new labor enthusiasm and creativity of the broad masses of workers in various places in Southern Manchuria.

The decision also pointed out: In the process of repairing the "Beiping" locomotive, the workers of the factory demonstrated the following characteristics: (1) The specific methods of the competition were very good, enabling more than 80% of the workers in all 14 branch factories to quickly participate in the competition, and everything was done by the workers themselves, fully demonstrating the broad mass character of this movement. (2) The creativity, initiative, and heroic and tenacious spirit of overcoming difficulties of the working class were fully displayed. For example, due to the lack of oxygen and calcium carbide (note: calcium carbide, commonly known as carbide), worker Gao Jingshui and others worked hard to research and create welding rods to replace it with electric welding. This not only solved the difficulties of repair work but also contributed to the entire industrial construction. In order to complete the task in a spirit of blitzkrieg, the workers automatically came up with various processing methods, so that the monthly production plan for January and the task of reviving two locomotives were successfully completed. Because the workers, with a sincere and touching spirit, correctly united and transformed the foremen who were technically skilled, experienced, and ideologically conservative, making them also actively participate in the competition, closely unite with the broad masses of workers, and learn from each other. (3) The competition was closely combined with political study and cultural entertainment, enlivening the daily life of the workers.

The decision finally called on the workers in the entire Northeast Liberated Area to continue to carry out the revolutionary production competition movement on a conscious basis, to celebrate the implementation of the Labor Insurance Regulations and to welcome the first "May 1st" Labor Day after the liberation of Northeast China, and to strive to complete and exceed the 1949 production plan and to welcome the comprehensive victory of the national revolution.
