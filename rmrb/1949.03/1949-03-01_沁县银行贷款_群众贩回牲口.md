    Qinxian Bank Loans
    Masses Buy Back Livestock
    [Taiyue News] The Qinxian branch of the People's Bank supports mass production by issuing livestock loans. The first loan of 30,000 RMB allowed Li Guicheng and others to purchase 14 donkeys and horses from Lüliang, making a net profit of over 90,000 RMB. This has motivated many people to apply for loans and pool shares to buy livestock. According to statistics from mid-December of last year, a total of 124 livestock were purchased with loans, and 32 were purchased with privately pooled shares. This greatly helps to solve the problem of spring plowing.

　　沁县银行贷款
    群众贩回牲口
    【太岳讯】人民银行沁县支行，扶植群众生产，发放牲口贷款。第一次贷出三万人民币，李贵成等至吕梁贩回驴马共十四头，获纯利九万多元。因此带动了很多群众贷款，集股去贩牲口。据去年十二月份中旬统计：用贷款贩回牲口共一百二十四头，私人集股贩回三十二头。这对解决春耕问题有很大帮助。
