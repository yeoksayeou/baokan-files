(Chahar News) Since October 25th of last year to January 5th of this year, the masses in Xingtang, Fuping, and Lingshou counties, using methods such as digging wolf pits, building stone coffins, setting fox traps, as well as shooting, hitting with sticks, and chasing with dogs, hunted twenty-six wolves, three hundred and twenty-three foxes, and thirty-seven badgers. All were purchased by the Promotion Society, and the masses received a total of 18,880 catties of millet. Nie Zhenlin and four others from Dongjinshan Village, Fourth District of Lingshou, hunted five wolves, eight foxes, and one badger last winter, earning 812 catties of millet. This not only eliminated animal pests but also used the income to solve difficulties during the spring plowing season, avoiding the threat of spring famine. Last winter, the Beiyue District proposed preventing and eliminating animal pests and rewarding the masses for hunting. The Jianping and other district Promotion Societies specifically set high prices to purchase game, which stimulated the masses' enthusiasm for hunting, resulting in great achievements.

　　行唐等县群众
    猎狐三百
    （察哈尔讯）行唐、阜平、灵寿三县群众，自去年十月二十五日至今年一月五日，用挖陷狼坑、垒石棺子、闹狐夹子以及枪射、棒打、狗追等方法，猎取狼二十六只、狐狸三百二十三只、獾三十七只，全部由推进社收购，群众共得米一万八千八百八十斤。灵寿四区东金山村聂振林等五人，去冬猎取狼五只、狐狸八只、獾一只，收入小米八百一十二斤。这样既消除了兽害，并以其收入解决了春耕期间的困难，避免了春荒威胁。按去冬北岳区提出防除兽害，奖励群众打猎，建屏等区推进社特定高价收买猎物，刺激了群众打猎情绪，故能获得很大成绩。
