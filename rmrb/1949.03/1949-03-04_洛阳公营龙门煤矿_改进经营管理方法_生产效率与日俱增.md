　　Luoyang Publicly Operated Longmen Coal Mine
    Improves Management Methods, Production Efficiency Increases Daily
    [Xinhua News Agency, Luoyang, 26th] Under the leadership of the People's Government, the Luoyang publicly operated Longmen Coal Mine (located forty li south of Luoyang City, belonging to the Limin Coal Mining Company) has actively improved its management methods and established employee welfare programs, leading to a gradual increase in production. Before liberation, when the mine was constructed and operated by the Henan Provincial Government under the Kuomintang, the rule over the workers was extremely strict, with over a hundred mine police raised specifically to suppress the workers. Wages were paid in raw coal, and workers had to sell the coal ten li away after finishing work each day. Furthermore, those in charge of mine affairs were corrupt and squandered resources, abusing personnel, leading to production being almost completely halted. When the democratic government took over last March, the workers urgently demanded wage adjustments and the abolition of foreman exploitation. However, because the new mine manager did not delve into the lower levels, issues such as worker living conditions and the selection of foremen were not properly resolved. The original group of rogue foremen continued to oppress the workers. After the People's Government discovered this, it appointed suitable personnel to serve as the mine manager, genuinely understood the situation at the lower levels, and addressed various issues according to their urgency. First, those foremen who most severely oppressed the workers were dismissed, and those workers who had been unreasonably dismissed in the past were reinstated. Simultaneously, through democratic investigations, seventeen cases of corruption were uncovered. Through these measures, the workers gained a preliminary understanding of the Chinese Communist Party's employee policies. Subsequently, the mine established a Mine Management Committee, with worker representatives participating in management work. Wages were determined by the workers themselves through democratic evaluation based on a progressive reward system for increased production, and then decided by the Mine Management Committee. Workers could raise their demands through employee representative meetings and employee welfare associations to effectively solve various difficulties. Currently, the employee welfare programs already established at the mine include an employee welfare association, canteen, traditional Chinese medicine clinic, Western medicine clinic, employee children's school, library, bathhouse, and cooperative. Recently, the number of employees has increased, and to meet the needs, it is planned to continue expanding welfare funds and strengthening service work. To enrich the workers' cultural and recreational life, the establishment of a club and a study committee is currently being planned. As such, the lives of the mine's employees have been guaranteed, and production efficiency has been increasing daily.

　　洛阳公营龙门煤矿
    改进经营管理方法  生产效率与日俱增
    【新华社洛阳二十六日电】洛阳公营龙门煤矿（位于洛市南四十华里，属利民煤矿公司）在人民政府领导下，积极改进了经营管理方法，建立了职工福利事业，生产渐见提高。该矿在解放前国民党河南省政府建设和经营时，对工人统治极严，豢养矿警百余，专肆压制工人。工资以生煤折付，工人每天下工后，还得到十里外去售煤，加以矿务主持者则贪污腐化，滥用人员，以致生产陷于半停顿状态。去年三月间民主政府接管之初，工人即迫切要求调整工资，废除工头剥削，但因该矿新经理不深入下层，工人生活和工头人选等问题未获适当解决，原来的一批流氓工头，仍站在工人头上施行压迫。后经人民政府发觉，乃另派适当人员充任该矿经理，切实了解下层情况，分别缓急处理各项问题。首先，开除了那些压迫工人最厉害的工头，并使那些过去被无理开除的工人复工；同时通过民主检查，查出了十七件贪污案件。经过这些措施，工人初步了解了中国共产党的职工政策。随之，该矿即成立了矿务管理委员会，工人也有代表参加管理工作，工资即按增产奖励的累进制由工人自己民主评议，而经矿务管委会决定。工人可以通过职工代表会、职工福利社提出自己的要求，以切实解决各种困难。现该矿已举办的工人福利事业，有职工福利社、食堂、中药室、西药室、职工子弟学校、图书馆、澡堂及合作社等。近来员工增加，为适应需要，拟继续扩充福利资金，加强服务工作。为调剂工人文化娱乐生活，刻正计划设立俱乐部及学习委员会。如此，该矿职工生活已获得保障，生产效率就与日俱增。
