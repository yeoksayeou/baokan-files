　　Liu Zhenyuan's Water Mill
    Li Yuan
    Comrade Liu Zhenyuan, who was elected as a Special-Class Model Worker at the Jidong Administrative Office Production and Supply Department's Hero Model Congress, originally worked in a store. In August 1947, in order to guarantee supplies for the counter-offensive army, the Administrative Office asked him to close the store and install a water mill using the water power of the Luan River. Although he had no experience in water conservancy, he gladly accepted the task.
    The water mill was installed in November, but the wheel broke as soon as it started working. He discovered that the thickness of the wheel was uneven and the wheel teeth were not equidistant. Replacing the wheel would be difficult due to lack of funds, and the iron factory was busy with military orders and had no time. So he found workers to repair it himself. He borrowed chisels, anvils, and bellows, and he himself, along with the workers, became blacksmiths. Director Wu of a certain machinery factory thought this was a futile effort and poured cold water on it, saying, "I've seen many people try to fix wheels, but I've never seen it done this way." But Comrade Liu Zhenyuan encouraged everyone, saying, "Who has ever done revolution before? Revolution is a new thing, and we did it. Now, we don't have other conditions, but we can use new methods to fix it." Everyone worked day and night, their hands broken and wrapped in cloth, but they kept going. In less than half a month, they finally repaired it. It was ten o'clock at night, and everyone was so happy that they wanted to test it immediately. The result was a complete success.
    This water mill, which grew out of difficulties, produced more than 400,000 jin in just half a year by last May, ensuring military supplies.
    After May, Lao Liu received instructions to develop the water mill into an enterprise. He initiated the organization of a "Worker Technical Research Association" to study how to reduce costs and save labor. In two months, the speed of the water mill and the output and quality of flour were significantly improved, and a "flour cleaning machine" was invented. First, he experimented with grinding wheat after removing the husks, and the result was that the flour was whiter and the yield increased from 85 jin to 90 jin per 100 jin of wheat. So he installed a millstone next to the water mill, also using water power.
    He believed that increasing the speed of the water mill would improve efficiency. He studied the reasons that hindered the wheel's rotation speed, changed the water buckets to semi-circular, set the water depth to five feet, and lengthened the distance between the wheel and the water. After these two improvements, the water mill speed increased from eleven or twelve revolutions per minute to twenty-eight revolutions, more than doubling the speed.
    Later, he carefully observed the function of sieves, winnowers, and windmills, combined the three, drew a diagram, and had a local craftsman make it. When shaken, the wheat, sand, skins, and leaves all fell separately. He gave it a name called "flour cleaning machine." The flour cleaning machine used water power to rotate, and could clean more than 4,000 jin of wheat every day, saving five laborers.
    After various improvements, the water mill's work efficiency was improved, with the output increasing from 550 jin per mill per day to 1,200 jin, while the number of employees was reduced from the original 51 to 26.
    Around the time of Tangshan's liberation last December, wheat could not be supplied for milling. The higher authorities instructed to stop milling flour and experiment with using water power to drive cotton bows to fluff cotton. Generally, an old bow could fluff 28 jin of cotton per day, while a small donkey could pull one and fluff 60 jin of cotton. Comrade Liu Zhenyuan bought five cotton bows and began using water power to fluff cotton. However, the cotton bow had a shortcoming: the broken leaves and other dirt that were fluffed off still remained on the cotton. Lao Liu believed that this was because the thorn roller was rotating too fast and creating wind, and the wind could not escape, picking up the broken leaves and other things and dropping them back onto the cotton. So he consulted with the director of the cotton bow factory, but there was no solution. He consulted with Technician Pan, who taught cotton fluffing. The technician believed that the problem was not here, and said, "I have experimented many times, and it is always like this. There is no way to change it." But Lao Liu watched the cotton bow for two days and believed that the key problem was that the wind could not escape. He asked a carpenter to move the head plate in front of the thorn roller and the supporting sieve five inches closer each, opening up a path for the wind to escape. After another experiment, the cotton that came out was whiter and cleaner.
    Comrade Liu Zhenyuan not only overcame difficulties and established a water mill, but also managed the factory well, giving full play to the enthusiasm of the workers and making the business thrive.
    "Those who do production work must understand the production process," Lao Liu emphasized this point. In the water mill, on the one hand, he learned from experienced people, and on the other hand, he personally went to work and experimented. He was very familiar with the production situation in the water mill. Lao Liu discussed things with everyone, listened to the workers' opinions, and changed the workers' attitude of simply "carrying out work." He organized the workers into groups according to each unit, democratically elected group leaders, and held group meetings every ten days. Group leaders participated in monthly factory affairs meetings to review and plan work. At first, the workers were not used to holding group meetings. When evaluating wages, the first month was discussed by the factory affairs meeting. He heard the workers' dissatisfaction and immediately changed it to group discussion. This time the group meeting was enthusiastic, because the quality of work was related to the amount of wages. The group meeting changed from cold to enthusiastic, and everyone revealed and criticized each other, discovering many things that could not be examined in the past. For example, one mill produced very little flour, and the reason could not be found. At this meeting, a worker said, "Isn't it because the night shift leader is sleeping and often grinding empty mills?" Many workers voluntarily stated their shortcomings and promised to improve. After that, Lao Liu paid more attention to promoting democracy, and everyone discussed things together. The workers' enthusiasm was further improved. Once, when repairing the dam, it was planned to be completed in no more than a month. During this time, Lao Liu had to attend a meeting and left for twenty days. When he came back, he saw that the workers were encouraging each other and the work was progressing rapidly. It was really completed in twenty-eight days. He helped the workers establish cooperatives to solve consumption problems. He personally read the newspaper to the workers, and trained those with little literacy to learn to read the newspaper, and those who were illiterate to learn to read. At the same time, he bought "Party Member Textbooks" and other materials for the workers to read, and subscribed to newspapers specifically for the workers, gradually creating a learning craze among the workers.
    Comrade Liu Zhenyuan is a good student of the workers and a good teacher of the workers. Therefore, he was able to overcome many difficulties and complete the tasks assigned to him by the higher authorities.

　　刘振远的水磨厂
    李远
    冀东行署生产供给处英雄模范大会上当选特等模范工作者的刘振远同志，原做商店工作。一九四七年八月，行署为保证反攻大军的供给，叫他把商店结束，利用滦河的水力按装水磨，他虽然对水利毫无经验，但欣然接受了任务。
    水磨在十一月装置好了，刚开工轮子就断了。他研究出是轮子的厚薄不同，轮齿远近不等。换新轮子一来经费困难，二来铁工厂忙军用没有时间，于是他找工自己修补。于是借来凿子、砧子、风箱，他亲自动手，劳动工人，做起铁匠来了。某机械厂的吴厂长，认为这是白闹，还泼了一瓢冷水：“我见过多少补轮子的，没见过这么补的。”但刘振远同志却鼓励大家说：“从前谁搞过革命呀？革命是新事情，咱们搞了；现在，咱们没有别的条件，就是能用新法子补。”大家昼夜不停，手打破用布包起来还是干，不到半个月，终于补成，时正夜十点，大家高兴得要连夜试验，结果，完全成功。
    这座在困难中成长的水磨厂，到去年五月，半年光景已出面四十多万斤，保证了军需供给。
    五月以后，老刘接到水磨厂向企业化发展的指示。他发起组织了“职工技术研究会”，研究如何减低成本，节省人力。两个月里，水磨的速度及面粉产量和质量都有了显著的提高，并发明了“净面机”。首先，他试验麦子碾去皮后再磨，结果是面色白了，产量由每百斤麦子出面八十五斤增到九十斤。于是在水磨旁边按上碾子，也用水力劳动。
    他认为增加水磨的速度才能提高效率，研究了阻碍轮转速度的原因，把水斗改成了半圆形，把水定为深五尺，加长了轮子和水的距离。两者改进以后，水磨速度由每分钟十一、二周转增加到二十八周，提高了一倍多。
    以后又留心观察了筛子、风罗、风车的作用，把三者结合在一起，画了一张图样，让本匠做好，摇动起来，麦子、砂石、皮子、叶子各落在一起。他给它起了个名字，叫“净面机”。净面机用水力转动，每天能净四千多斤麦子，节省了五个劳动力。
    经过各方面的改进，水磨厂的工作效率提高了，由每个磨每天五百五十斤的产量增加到一千二百斤，职工却由原来的五十一个减到二十六个。
    去年十二月唐山解放前后，麦子供不上磨了，上级指示停止磨面，试验水力风弓弹棉花。一般旧弓，一天一张弹二十八斤花，用一个小驴拉，可弹六十斤花。刘振远同志买了五张风弓，开始利用水力弹棉花了，但是，风弓有个缺点，弹掉的碎叶等脏东西，仍然带到花上去，老刘认为这是刺滚子转快起风，风出不去卷起碎叶等东西又落到了花上。于是找风弓工厂的厂长研究，结果没办法。找教弹花的潘技师商量，技师认为毛病不在这儿，并说：“我试验了多次，都这样，没法改。”可是老刘在风弓旁边看了两天，相信毛病的关键就是风出不去。乃请木匠把刺滚子前边的迎头板和托挡筛子挪近各五寸，闪开风的出路，再一试验，出的花又白又净。
    刘振远同志不仅克服了困难，建立了水磨厂，而且也善于管理工厂，发挥了职工的积极性，使业务蒸蒸日上。
    “做生产工作的人，必须了解生产的过程。”老刘很强调这一点。他在水磨厂里，一方面找有经验的人学习，另方面亲自到工作中去试验，水磨上的生产情况他是非常熟悉的。老刘有事和大家商量，听取工人的意见，改变了工人“扛活”的劳动态度。他把工人按各单位编了小组，民主选出组长，十天开一次小组会，小组长参加每月一次的厂务会议，检讨工作，计划工作。最初，工人不习惯开小组会。评议工资时，第一个月是由厂务会议讨论的，他听到工人不满意的反映，就马上改由小组讨论，这次小组会发言热烈，因为工作干的好坏与工资多少有关系，小组会由冷淡转为热烈，互相揭露批评，发现了许多过去考查不出的事情。比方，有一座磨，磨面子很少，找不出原因。这次会上，工人说：“还不是夜班组长睡觉，常研空磨？”许多工人自动说出了缺点，保证改进。此后老刘更注意了发扬民主，有事大家商量。工人积极性更加提高，一次，修水坝，计划不超过一个月就要完成。这时间老刘赶上有事开会，一去二十来天，回来一看，工人互相勉励，工作进展很快，真的二十八天就完成了。他帮助工人建立合作社，解决消费问题。他亲自给工人读报，并培养识字少的学读报，不识字的学字。同时买了“党员课本”等给工人看，并专给工人订了报纸，逐渐造成了工人的学习热潮。
    刘振远同志，是工人的好学生，又是工人的好先生。因此，他能够战胜重重的困难，完成上级赋予自己的任务。
