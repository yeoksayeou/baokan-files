　　No Meals to be Demanded by Personnel on Business Trips
　　To the Editor:
　　Item 2 of the Supply Standards for Local Staff in the North China Region, 1948, regarding Public and Miscellaneous Expenses, Section 3, Point 1, stipulated: For official business trips with fewer than seven people, each person should receive a travel allowance of three catties of millet per day, and the original grain for firewood and vegetables should be issued as usual. Point 2 stipulated that county and district cadres working in rural areas should be provided meals and not receive subsidies. Other personnel on foot for business trips are strictly prohibited from demanding meals from the masses. Furthermore, the North Yue Administrative Office's Finance and Administration Document No. 405, dated October 20th, Section 2 stated: To prevent individual personnel from still demanding meals from the masses after receiving travel allowances, each county and municipal government should notify all districts and villages: "All personnel on foot for business trips are strictly prohibited from demanding meals from the masses (in remote areas with small mountain paths where there is no place to buy food, flexibility is allowed, but payment must be made at market prices after the meal)."
　　Our county, in accordance with orders and notices, informed all districts and villages to comply. However, in the process of implementation, many disputes have arisen. Personnel on foot demand that village cadres provide meals, and some village cadres comply, while others follow the instructions of higher authorities and refuse to provide meals, resulting in being scolded, and some even being beaten. Therefore, we request answers to the following questions:
　　1. Does the travel allowance provision include the military? If not, what should be done for military personnel on foot for business trips?
　　2. How should personnel from other liberated areas passing through our region be handled?
　　3. Are demobilized soldiers also given this travel allowance? If not, what should be done?
　　4. Local and military systems should be notified to abide by government laws and regulations and not to beat or scold village cadres.

　　To the Fuping County Government Finance Section:
　　The following are the answers to your questions regarding meals for military and local personnel on business trips:
　　To facilitate work and reduce the trouble for the masses, the North China Government and the North China Military Region Headquarters clearly stipulated in the supply standards for military and local personnel formulated last year that personnel on official business trips traveling more than sixty li per day (more than one hundred and twenty li by bicycle) should receive an additional three catties of millet per day as a business trip allowance, and the original grain, firewood, and vegetable allowance should be issued as usual. Neither military nor local personnel should demand meals from the masses again. Therefore, personnel on business trips should generally not ask the masses to provide meals. You mentioned that some village cadres were scolded or even beaten for not providing meals, which is a violation of discipline and should be thoroughly investigated and reported through the organizational system for handling. The specific circumstances should also be considered when implementing the system. For example, in some areas (mountainous areas) where there is no food for sale, and it is impossible to buy food even with money, the only option is to demand meals from the masses. For the sake of work, as long as the village cadres and the masses are informed clearly, the village cadres and the masses can and should do it. However, those who have meals provided must hand over their original food and business trip allowance to the masses as required. If individual comrades, in places where food can be bought, demand meals to gain an advantage and do not hand over the grain coupons, firewood and vegetable money, and business trip allowance to the masses as required, this is a violation of our system and a violation of mass discipline. This phenomenon is not allowed. Retired soldiers and personnel from other liberated areas passing through our region should also follow this system. Those who do not comply and beat or scold village cadres can be dealt with by the local government. Those village cadres and individual members of the masses who rigidly enforce the system and refuse to provide meals when it is genuinely impossible to buy food should also be educated and corrected.

### 出差人员不得派饭

　　出差人员不得派饭编辑同志：
    华北区一九四八年地方工作人员供给标准第二项公用杂项开支部份，第三条第一点，曾规定：七人以下因公出差，每人每日发给旅费小米三斤，原柴菜金食粮照发。第二点规定县区干部在乡村工作一律派饭不发津贴，其他出差走路人员，一律不准向群众派饭，又北岳行署十月二十日财行字四○五号通知第二项节开：为防止个别人员领取出差旅费后仍向群众派饭现象，各县市政府应通知各区村：“凡出差走路人员，一律不准向群众派饭（山沟小道僻静地方无卖吃食的地方，可灵活，但用饭后必须按市价给款）。
    我县根据命令通知，转知各区村遵照执行。但在执行当中，发生了很多纠纷，走路的人员要让村干部派饭，有的村干部就派，有的村干部遵行上级指示不予派饭，并因此挨骂，还有的被打。因此，我们请答复以下问题：
    一、旅费规定是否包括军队？如不包括，部队出差走路人员应怎么办？
    二、其他解放区路过本区者应如何办理？
    三、退伍军人是否也按此旅费发给？如不发应怎么办？
    四、应通知地方系统与部队系统，应遵守政府法令，不应打骂村干部。
    　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　阜平县政府财政科阜平县政府财政科：
    关于部队及地方人员出差派饭的问题答复如下：
    为便利工作并减少群众的麻烦，所以华北政府和华北军区司令部在去年所制定的部队与地方人员供给标准中，都明确规定，因公出差着，每日行程在六十里以上（骑车子一二○里以上），每人每日增发出差费小米三斤，原来之食粮柴菜金照发，无论部队或地方人员，均不得再向群众派饭。故出差人员，一般的情况下不应再叫群众派饭吃。你所说有的村干部，因不予派饭致被骂或个别的被打，这是违犯纪律的行为，应当彻底检查，按照组织系统反映，求得处理。在执行制度时，也应看具体情况。比如有些地区（山地）没有卖食品的，有钱买不到饭吃，没有办法，只有向群众派饭吃，为了工作，只要给村干部和群众说明白，村干部和群众是可以办到的，而且也应该办到。但吃派饭的人，必须把原来的伙食及出差补助费，照规定如数交给群众。假如有个别的同志，在可能买到饭吃的地方，而为了讨便宜去派饭，派了饭又不按规定把粮票柴菜金及出差补助费交给群众，这便是破坏我们的制度与违犯群众纪律。这种现象是不允许的。荣退军人及其他解放区人员路过本区时，也要按照这个制度执行。不执行反要打骂村干部者，可由当地政府解决。而真正买不到饭吃，村干部与个别群众，机械执行制度，不予派饭者，亦应教育纠正。
