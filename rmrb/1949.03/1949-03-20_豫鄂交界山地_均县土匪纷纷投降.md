　　Jun County Bandits Surrender En Masse

Xinhua News Agency, Central Plains, 18th—Bandit forces in Jun County, northwest of Laohekou, Hubei, are surrendering their weapons to the People's Liberation Army en masse. In just half a month, from February 12th to the end of February, three groups surrendered in organized units, including the puppet Jun County Detachment 3rd Battalion, totaling more than 280 men, bringing with them five machine guns and 237 rifles and carbines. Jun County is located on the border of Henan and Hubei, and the famous Wudang Mountains stretch through the county. It has always been a place where Kuomintang reactionary teams and bandit forces ran rampant. Since the People's Liberation Army recovered Fang County and Zhushan, with the combination of military suppression and political offensive, the bandits in the county have collapsed and disintegrated, and local order has been stabilized.

　　豫鄂交界山地
  　均县土匪纷纷投降
    【新华社中原十八日电】湖北老河口西北的均县境内土匪武装纷纷向解放军缴枪投降，仅二月十二日至二月底半个月内，成股投降的计有伪均县支队第三营等三股共二百八十余名，携来机枪五挺，长短枪二百三十七支。均县地处豫鄂交界，著名的武当山绵延该县，一向为国民党反动团队及土匪武装横行之地，自解放军收复房县、竹山后，在军事清剿与政治攻势配合下，该县土匪即土崩瓦解，地方秩序乃告安定。
