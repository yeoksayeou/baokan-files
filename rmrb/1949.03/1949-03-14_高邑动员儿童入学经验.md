　　Gaoyi's Experience in Mobilizing Children to Enroll in School
    Gaoyi Education Section
    Last autumn, in Gaoyi County, Taihang District, the average regular school attendance was 5,768 children, accounting for 64.5% of the county's school-age children. In some villages, it reached 90%, more than double the number before the autumn vacation. How was this achievement attained? First, the new educational policy was publicized, and combined with a review of the past deviations in education, open self-criticism was made to the masses, so that the masses believed that we were truly running schools. For example, in villages such as Dongzhang Village, Zhonghan, Wancheng, Xitaying, and Sima Xian, deviations in past educational work were reviewed in mass meetings and parent meetings. The new educational policy of strengthening cultural education in the future was publicized, and the teachers also expressed their attitude at the meeting (guaranteeing that students would learn to read). The importance of going to school was explained from the painful history of the masses (in the past, they could not go to school), the comparison between the old and new societies, and the prospects for social development. After the children went to school, they were organized to study, and the actual results dispelled the concerns of the masses. When Che Zhan held a parent meeting, he asked a student who was only eight years old and had been in school for one month to practice writing (writing fifteen characters). Other schools also asked students to write and take them back for their parents to see. An achievement exhibition was set up in the school, etc., to change their perception of the school. When parents saw the results, they automatically sent their children to school. Then, explain to the students to open up their minds and make them consciously enroll in school.

    Secondly, investigate and study to understand the difficulties of children's families, find the reasons, and combine with the immediate interests of the masses to open up their minds. The reasons why children do not go to school are different, so specific investigations and studies must be carried out, and then the parents' specific situations must be taken into account to open up their minds. Wang Jinfeng, a girl from Zhonghan Village, only had her mother and daughter in the family, farming eleven mu of land, and the family relied entirely on this daughter's labor, so she did not enroll in school. The teacher personally went to her house to mobilize her. Her mother was weaving cloth, and when she heard that she was asked to go to school, she said, "I don't have time, I can't recognize a word, I'm just doing farmwork." The teacher patiently explained to her: "If you weave cloth and sell cloth, how can you do it if you don't recognize the bills? Let your child go to school, and it will be so much better to sell cloth when she can read!" He also explained the new policy, guaranteeing that the child would learn to read. When Wang Jinfeng's mother heard this, she immediately stopped weaving and immediately told Jinfeng to go to school.

    Thirdly, plan and focus on mobilizing children to enroll in school, and also have certain systems to guarantee it. First of all, we should understand the reasons why children do not go to school, and after specific mobilization, first mobilize those who are easy to mobilize to go to school, consolidate them, and use these students' personal experience of learning to mobilize others. In this way, there will be more students. Another point is that each school has established a regular system, so that parents can recognize that today's school is more serious than in the past from actual actions. For example, each school has established a roll call and leave system. In order to prevent students from skipping school, they discussed with parents and jointly stipulated that parents should ask for leave. Some student unions have also formulated school covenants to ensure compliance with school rules. The teaching methods of each school are also combined with the actual situation of the countryside, and learning is combined with production. Heto Village picks up firewood in the morning, and Nanqiu Village also stipulates the time for picking up firewood, which plays a role in guaranteeing and consolidating children's schooling.

　　高邑动员儿童入学经验
    高邑教育科
    去年秋后，太行区高邑全县平均经常到校儿童五千七百六十八人，占全县学龄儿童百分之六十四点五，个别村达到百分之九十，比秋假前入校的多了一倍以上。这样的成绩是怎样得来的？首先是宣传了新的教育方针，结合检查过去教育工作上的偏向，向群众作公开的自我批评，使群众相信我们真是办学，如东张村、中韩、万城、西塔影、寺马闲等村庄，都是在群众大会上和家长会上检讨了过去教育工作上的偏向，宣传今后要加强文化教育的新教育工作的方针，教员同志在会上也表明了自己的态度（保证叫学生识下字）。并从群众痛苦的历史（过去不能上学）、新旧社会对比上，及社会发展前途上来说明上学的重要，儿童到校后，即组织学习，以实际效果打破群众顾虑。车站在开家长会时，叫一个八岁才上学一个月的学生演习写字（写十五个），别的学校也同样叫学生写字，拿回叫家长看，校内设成绩展览处等等，来转变对学校的认识。家长看到成绩，就自动送子弟入校。再给学生解释打通思想，使其自觉入校。
    其次调查研究了解儿童家庭困难，寻找原因，结合群众切身利益打通思想。儿童不入校的原因不同，必须进行具体调查研究，然后针对家长具体情况打通思想。中韩村的女生王金凤，家中只母女两人，种地十一亩，家里全凭这闺女劳动哩，没入校。教员就亲身到她家去动员，她母亲正在织布，一说叫她上学，就说：“没空，认不了个字，光扭秧歌。”先生就耐心给她解释：“你织下布卖布，认不得票怎办？叫孩子上学，认了字，卖布多么好呢！”又说明现在的新方针，保证叫孩子识下字。王金凤母亲听见这样说，马上停止织布，马上叫金凤上学去了。
    再次，有计划，有重点动员儿童入校，还要有一定的制度保证。首先应了解儿童不上学原因，具体作动员后，先把好动员的动员到校，巩固起来，用这批学生学习的亲身体会再叫他们动员别的。这样学生就多起来了，还有一点，就是各校建立了正规制，从实际行动中使家长认识今天办学比过去认真，如各校均建立了点名、请假制度，为了防止学生逃学，和家长商讨共同规定了由家长来请假，有的学生会也制定了入校公约，保证遵守校规。各校教学方法也与农村实际相结合，学习与生产相结合。河头村早上拾柴，南邱村也规定拾柴时间，都对儿童上学起了保证巩固作用。
