[Jizhong Dispatch] Kang Bo, a technician at the Botou Yonghua Match Company, has successfully researched and manufactured "phosphorus sesquisulfide," an important raw material for matches, greatly improving the quality of the matches. Since the factory resumed operations after liberation, it has been extremely difficult to purchase raw materials, and it could only purchase some red phosphorus saltpeter from the KMT-controlled areas to barely maintain production. However, matches made with red phosphorus either exploded or would not light. Later, when made with local saltpeter and sulfur, the quality was even worse. Finally, yellow phosphorus was used, but yellow phosphorus is too toxic and greatly harms the health of the workers. Therefore, Kang Bo was determined to trial-produce "phosphorus sesquisulfide" using sulfur and yellow phosphorus. He began research in October last year. Initially, he used a 2.5-centimeter-thick iron plate to make a boiler for producing "phosphorus sesquisulfide." However, because the iron plate was too thin and the workmanship was rough, it released toxic gas during use, causing workers Li Guanxiao and Li Chou to once be nearly asphyxiated, and the trial was unsuccessful. Kang Bo was not discouraged by this. He continued to study diligently and trial-produced a second boiler, thickening the iron plate and setting up a distilling apparatus, so that the sulfur and yellow phosphorus mixed and turned into a gas, which was then distilled into solid "phosphorus sesquisulfide," finally achieving success. The manufactured "phosphorus sesquisulfide" is golden in color and of very good quality. Currently, the daily output is 104 pounds, guaranteeing self-sufficiency. At the same time, it is much cheaper than buying "phosphorus sesquisulfide" from outside, and the matches produced ignite very easily, improving product quality and making it in high demand.

Kang Bo's successful research and manufacture of "phosphorus sesquisulfide" is due, on the one hand, to his ability to cooperate with workers and obtain the assistance of dispensing workers such as Shan Shengcai and Li Guanxiao; on the other hand, he had a high level of production enthusiasm and persisted in two months of painstaking research. His hands were burned for more than a month, but this never affected his mood and confidence. Currently, the match heads are not bright enough, and Kang Bo is working with the workers to study how to improve them.

  　试制硫化磷成功
    【冀中电】泊头市永华火柴公司技师康波，研究制造火柴重要原料“硫化磷”获得成功，大大提高火柴质量。该厂自解放后复工以来，购买原料极度困难，仅能从蒋区购来一些赤磷盐卜，勉强坚持生产。但赤磷做出的火柴，不是放炮就是画不着。后用土硝、硫磺制造，质量更坏。最后改用黄磷，但黄磷毒素太大，对工人健康有极大损害。由此，康波乃下定决心用硫磺和黄磷试制“硫化磷”，去年十月开始研究，最初用二分五厘厚之铁板，制成作“硫化磷”的锅炉，因铁板太薄，制的又粗糙，用时撒毒气，致使工人李冠萧，李丑曾一度被熏死过去，没有成功。康波并未因此灰心，仍苦心钻研，又第二次试制锅炉，加厚铁板，并设置了蒸溜器，使硫磺和黄磷混合后变成气体，经蒸溜后，变成固体“硫化磷”，终于制造成功。制造出的“硫化磷”颜色金黄，质量很好。现日产一百零四磅，保证了自给。同时比买外来的“硫化磷”贱很多，制出的火柴，发火很灵，使产品质量提高，供不应求。
    康波研究制造“硫化磷”的成功，一方面因为他能与工人合作，得到配药工人单生才李冠萧等的协助；其次是他有高度生产热情，坚持了两个月的苦心研究，手被烧烂了一个多月，从未影响到他的情绪和信心。现在火柴头还不够鲜亮，康波正和工人们研究改善。
