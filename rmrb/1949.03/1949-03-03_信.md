　　Letter
    Luoxin
    As I passed by the side of the vehicle, I saw female spinning workers Quan Pingjin and Cao Qiaohua looking at a piece of paper, heads together. When I walked over, they immediately hid it behind their backs, smiling. I also smiled and said, "What secret are you hiding from me?" I knew that these young women were most afraid of being told they had "secrets". Sure enough, as soon as I finished speaking, they handed me the paper and said, "Here, this is a letter." It turned out to be a letter from Cao Qiaohua to Quan Pingjin. After I finished reading it, I joked, "I bet there's more than just this, there's also Pingjin's letter." Pingjin said, "Yes!" She took out a large handful from her pocket, and I took them all to read them one by one. Their letters said:
    "Second Sister Quan Pingjin: I love you very much. You are an active comrade in the yarn factory. You attend classes every day... I am very happy that you are a model worker. You must cherish the factory's raw materials. Second Sister, work hard to learn technology... You are like my teacher... Cao Qiaohua, February 16th."
    "Comrade Cao Qiaohua: How is your study lately? Have you made progress? I hope you will practice writing at home. Now you must study hard... I hope you will strive to be a model worker in production... I hope you will apply to join the Youth League, and work together to make progress. We will all work hard to make progress. We are all young people and must join the Youth League to be a glorious member of the Youth League... Quan Pingjin, February 17th"
    "Dear Sister Weizhen: You study very well. I want to learn from you. Please help me! Sister, seeing that you are all Communist Party members, I am lagging behind. Please sisters help me! If I have any shortcomings, please point them out to me and tell me to correct them. Sister, please feel free to point them out! I will definitely accept them well... I applied to join the Party a long time ago, but it has not been approved until now. You are all glorious, but don't forget your little sister. Sister, help me improve and correct my shortcomings. I am willing to be a Communist Party member and resolutely serve the people... I wish you hard work in production, add oil, and actively learn to strive for a model, Sister Pingjin, the 20th day of the first month."
    "Dear Sister Pingjin: I have a hope for you. I hope you will intensify your studies, work hard in production, and also study hard... This time, model workers are being selected again. I hope Sister Pingjin will work hard to strive for the model... You must also help your sister learn... Xu Xianglan, the 20th day of the first month."
    “……”
    -- There are many letters, I will not copy them all. The above letters, except for the slight omissions that I have omitted, are all copied from the original letters. I was very surprised to see that these letters fully demonstrate the young female workers' love and respect for their political party - the Communist Party, and their precious class friendship. Moreover, they had no opportunity to study in the old society, and could not read a single character, but in the year since liberation, how quickly they have progressed ideologically and culturally!

　　信
    洛辛
    我从车边经过，见络纱女工权平金与曹巧花，头碰头的在看一个纸条，我走了过去，她们马上就笑着藏到背后了，我也笑着说：“什么秘密不让我看呀？”我知道，这些小闺女们，最怕人说她们有“秘密”。可不，我话刚说完，她们便把纸条递给我说：“看吧，这是信。”原来是曹巧花给权平金写的信。我看完了，打趣的说：“准不止这，还有平金的信。”平金说：“有！”她从口袋里掏出了一大把，我都要了来，一封一封的看了看。她们信上写着：
    “二姐权平金：我很爱你，你是纱厂积极的同志，你是每天上课，……我是非常高兴你做模范工人，你要爱本厂原料。二姐，努力学习技术，……你好比是我的老师……曹巧花二月十六日”。
    “曹巧花同志：你最近学习怎样呢？进步了没有？我希望你在家中要好好练习写字，现在要用心学习……我希望你在生产上，要争取作一个模范工人……我希望你要请求入团，共同努力进步，咱们都努力进步，咱们都是青年，要参加青年团作一个光荣的青年团员……权平金二月十七日”
    “亲爱的维珍姐姐：你学习是很好的，我要向你学习，帮助我吧！姐姐，看你们都是共产党员，就是我落后了，请姐姐妹妹们帮助我吧！我有什么缺点，就给我提出来，叫我改过，姐姐放心大胆的给提吧！我一定要很好的接受……，我早就请求入党了，一直到现在也没有批准，你们都是光荣的，可别忘了小妹妹我，姐姐帮助我进步改进缺点，我愿作一个共产党员，坚决的为人民服务……祝你努力生产加油干，积极学习争模范，妹平金正月二十日”
    “亲爱的平金姐姐：我对你有个希望，望你要加紧学习，努力生产，而且还要好好研究……这次又选模范工人，我希望平金姐姐要努力争取模范，……你还要帮助妹妹学习……许香兰正月二十日”。
    “……”。
    ——信很多，我不再抄了，上面的信，除了虚点之处是我省略了的而外，全是照原信抄写下来的，我看了很惊奇，这些信里，充分表现出年青的女工们对自己的政党——共产党的敬爱，和宝贵的阶级友情，而且他们在旧社会没有学习机会，一个大字不识，而解放后一年来，在思想上与文化上，进步得是多么的快啊！
