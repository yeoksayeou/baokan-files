Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 18th – According to Shanghai news: More than one thousand students and staff of Fudan University held an anti-hunger march and demonstration on the 16th. The slogan of the demonstrating masses was “Struggle for Survival.” Due to the oppression of high prices, they have fallen into a desperate situation. Therefore, they demanded an increase in subsidies for professors and publicly funded students, and improvement of the living conditions of the staff. When the demonstration took place, Kuomintang police came out in force to threaten them. In other news: All professors at Sichuan University in Chengdu have taken a week-long leave of absence starting on the 14th to protest meager treatment that is insufficient to maintain their livelihood.

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 19th – Following the anti-hunger march and demonstration held by more than a thousand students of Fudan University in Shanghai on the 16th, more than three thousand students in Chongqing held similar marches and demonstrations on the 17th. The schools participating in the march included Chongqing University, the Central Industrial Vocational School, Sichuan Provincial College of Education, Chongqing Middle School, and other eight institutions. They put forward demands to the Kuomintang Chongqing Pacification Headquarters for full public funding, allocation of supplies, and the issuance of contingency funds to employees. The Kuomintang bandit gang authorities have consistently failed to provide concrete answers to the students' demands.

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 18th – The Kuomintang government's bogus gold yuan notes continue to plummet in value. In the Shanghai market, rice reached a new high price of 44,000 bogus gold yuan per shi (unit of dry measure) on the 17th of this month. According to the Kuomintang Central News Agency, the Shanghai wholesale price index for the first week of this month was 2,730 times the level of August last year, an increase of one-fold compared to a week earlier. In addition to Shanghai, prices in Qingdao last month rose three-fold in one week.

　　反对国民党高物价压迫
    沪渝学生游行示威
    伪币狂跌物价一周涨了一倍
    【新华社陕北十八日电】据上海消息：复旦大学学生与校工一千余人于十六日举行反饥饿游行示威。示威群众的口号是争生存。由于高物价的压迫，生活已陷于绝境，因此他们要求增加教授与公费生的补助费，和改善校工的生活条件。示威发生时，国民党警察曾纷纷出动加以威胁。另息：成都四川大学全体教授为抗议待遇菲薄不足维持生活，已于十四日起实行总请假一周。
    【新华社陕北十九日电】在上海复旦大学千余学生十六日举行反饥饿游行示威之后，重庆三千余学生在十七日举行了同样的游行示威。参加游行的学校包括重庆大学、中央工业专科学校及省立四川教育学院、重庆中学等八单位。他们向国民党重庆绥靖公署提出全面公费、配给实物、发给员工应变费等要求。国民党匪帮当局对学生们的要求始终未作具体答复。
    【新华社陕北十八日电】国民党政府的伪金圆券继续狂跌。在上海市场，大米每市石本月十七日已达到伪金圆券四万四千元的新高价。据国民党中央社承认，本月第一周上海批发物价指数已为去年八月水平的二千七百三十倍，较一周前上涨一倍。除上海外，上月间青岛物价一周内曾上涨达三倍。
