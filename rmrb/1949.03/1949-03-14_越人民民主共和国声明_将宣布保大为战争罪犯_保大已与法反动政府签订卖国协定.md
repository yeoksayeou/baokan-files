    Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 12th. Paris dispatch: The traitorous agreement concluded between the deposed Vietnamese King Bảo Đại and the French government on February 23rd was formally signed by French President Auriol and Bảo Đại at the Élysée Palace in Paris on the 8th of this month. According to the agreement, Bảo Đại, the representative of the Vietnamese reactionaries, has completely sold out Vietnam's national interests under the guise of so-called "independence within the French Union." According to an Agence France-Presse dispatch from the 8th, the main contents of the Élysée Palace agreement are as follows: Politically, Bảo Đại agreed to France's policy of partitioning Vietnam, dividing Vietnam into three so-called "independent states within the French Union"—Laos, Cambodia, and Vietnam (composed of Tonkin, Annam, and Cochinchina)—with Bảo Đại serving as the puppet head of the pseudo-Vietnamese government. France will continue to maintain special judicial rights applicable to French residents in Vietnam. Diplomatically, Bảo Đại agreed to "entrust" Vietnam's diplomatic rights to France. Militarily, Bảo Đại agreed that French colonialists could maintain military bases in Vietnam, and French troops could move freely on Vietnamese territory. The Vietnamese puppet army continues to cooperate with the French army. In wartime, a joint staff headquarters will be established under the French command. Economically, Bảo Đại agreed to France's free investment in Vietnam and the return of assets lost by the French side in the war of aggression against Vietnam. Culturally, Bảo Đại agreed that French will continue to be taught in Vietnamese schools at all levels. According to the agreement, Bảo Đại will return to Vietnam on April 25th, and the agreement will come into effect on the day Bảo Đại arrives in Vietnam.
