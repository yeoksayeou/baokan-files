　　Three Words and Two Phrases

            Be Vigilant Against Counter-Revolutionary Special Agents Pretending to Repent
    The counter-revolutionary special agents in Anyang, like Li Baozhong, etc., deceive the people's democratic government, pretend to repent and start anew, and perform meritorious service to redeem their crimes, in order to carry out their plots of assassination and conspiracy. This is a dangerous and poisonous means used by the counter-revolutionary special agents in their dying struggle, and it is taking advantage of our lenient policy. It must be known that the closer the enemy gets to the dying stage of being crushed by counter-revolutionary armed forces, the more they will use various dangerous and poisonous means and methods of concealed activities to speculate and drill into us, outwardly showing repentance, and secretly carrying out poisonous plots to undermine our revolutionary cause and endanger our revolutionary people. Our party, government, military, and public security departments in various places, especially in various cities, must not become paralyzed in their thinking because we are already approaching national victory and the enemy and puppets are already approaching death, so as to ignore the poisonous plots of the counter-revolutionary special agents, causing undue losses to the revolutionary people and cause. Therefore, we must be highly vigilant and pay close attention to the enemy, puppets, and counter-revolutionary special agents who register with the government to repent, handle them cautiously, and severely punish and resolutely suppress the counter-revolutionary special agents who pretend to repent and carry out concealed activities.

　　三言两语
            警惕匪特假装悔过
    安阳匪特栗保重等，欺骗人民民主政府，假装悔过自新、立功赎罪，以遂其图谋暗杀阴谋，是匪特在垂死挣扎时的险毒手段，是钻我们宽大政策的空子。须知敌人越到反革命武装遭受粉碎的垂死阶段，越会用各种险毒手段和隐蔽活动的方法，向我们投机钻隙，阳示悔祸，暗行毒谋，破坏我们的革命事业，危害我们的革命人民，我各地、特别是各城市党、政、军和公安部门在思想上不要以为我们已经接近全国胜利，敌伪已经接近死亡而麻痹起来，以致忽视匪特毒谋，招致革命人民与事业不应有的损失，为此，对向政府登记悔过的敌伪匪特必须引起高度警惕和严密注意，审慎处理，对于假装悔过，隐蔽活动的匪特，必须严厉惩办，坚决镇压。
