　　Meeting Decisions
  　Unified Management of Foreign Trade
  　Vigorously Organize Cooperative Supply and Marketing
    In order to consolidate achievements, correct deviations, and elevate the trade work of the Central Plains people a step further on the existing foundation, the meeting decided: (1) Foreign trade will be managed uniformly by import and export trade companies, striving for the export of local products and strictly prohibiting the import of all superstitious items, luxury goods, etc., in order to protect the production and construction of the liberated areas. Unified management will be implemented for foreign procurement to reduce the manipulation of the market by speculators. Domestic trade should focus on regulating supply and demand, stabilizing prices, and supporting production. On the basis of completing the basic tasks of foreign and domestic trade, efforts should be made to gradually accumulate capital to strengthen state-owned enterprises. (2) Inland trade companies should focus on managing grain, cotton, oil, and salt in order to control market regulation. Local companies and stores should vigorously help organize supply and marketing cooperatives and consumer cooperatives as powerful assistants to state-owned commerce, in order to reduce the intermediate exploitation of producers and consumers by merchants. Local products in this region should be purchased directly as much as possible to reduce private merchant speculation. (3) Trade organizations must strengthen unified leadership to achieve consistent steps and strive towards enterprise management. Trade authorities at all levels should obey the leadership of the Party committees at the same level in terms of the Party's unified principles and policies; in terms of fund allocation, task acceptance and completion, etc., they belong to the vertical system of leadership. The Kaifeng and Zhengzhou city companies, as well as the Yu Tai Import and Export Trade Company and the Thailand Tobacco Company, are directly under the leadership of the head office. The four city companies of Luoyang, Shangqiu, Xuchang, and Luohe are under the dual leadership of the head office and the branch office. (4) Strengthen investigation and research work to grasp market conditions, in order to reduce blindness in work. (5) Strengthen political and business learning, especially to learn and master the trade policies of state-owned commerce. New comrades who join the work should be educated to establish a revolutionary outlook on life of serving the people, and to transform bad thoughts and bad work styles that violate the interests of the people.
