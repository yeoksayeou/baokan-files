　　【Zhangyuan Telegram】After rectification and study, the staff of Zhangjiakou Post Office and its three subordinate branches have begun to establish a new work attitude, and work is developing in a normal direction. After the bureau was taken over and reopened for business at the end of last year, some employees failed to work with all their might due to concerns about future salary standards and job positions. Some comrades from the old liberated areas were also not settled down due to frequent internal cadre adjustments. In addition, the division of labor was not clear enough, and official documents were mixed with general letters, which once showed confusion. Some employees were late or left early. In order to develop business normally, the bureau began rectification at the end of January, which enlightened the employees' awareness. Systems such as the attendance sheet system and the separate handling of general letters and official documents have been stipulated, and the division of labor has been initially clarified. In the past, less than a thousand pieces of mail were processed daily, taking seven or eight hours to seal and dispatch. Now, with one thousand two to three hundred pieces, it only takes four or five hours, speeding up delivery time and gradually overcoming phenomena such as being late or leaving early, and sealing and dispatching errors. In order to improve employees' political awareness, study groups have been established, and a two-hour study system has been stipulated, which has now begun.

　　张垣邮局初步整顿
    建立考勤制度明确分工
  　提高工作效率两倍
    【张垣电】张家口邮局及所属三个支局经过整顿和学习，职工们开始建立了新的工作态度，工作向正常方面发展。去年年底，该局为我接收恢复营业后，一部职工因对今后薪金标准及工作岗位有所顾虑，未能全力工作，有些从老区来的同志，也因内部干部调整较多，不够安心，加以分工不十分明确，机关公文与一般信件混合处理等原因，曾一度表现混乱。有些职员迟到早退。为了正常地发展业务，该局于一月底开始整顿，启发了职工们的自觉性。规定了考勤单制，一般信件与机关公文分开办理等制度，初步的明确分工。过去每天不足千件邮件，封发七、八小时，现在一千二、三百件，只需四、五小时，加速了投递时间，逐渐克服了迟到早退，封发错误等现象。为提高员工政治认识，建立了学习小组，规定了两小时的学习制度，现已开始学习。
