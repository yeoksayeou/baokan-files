Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, March 20th: TASS, Stockholm, March 17th: During the parliamentary debate on defense issues, Member of Parliament Gunnar Åhman and Member of Parliament Hilding Hagberg read out the Swedish Communist Party's statement in the upper and lower houses of parliament, respectively. The statement said: The Swedish Communist Party, as before, adheres to its repeated declarations, that is, the Swedish Communist Party is always ready to defend the country's independence and the freedom of the Swedish people. The Soviet Union is a socialist country, which is why the Soviet Union fundamentally opposes the imperialist militarist policy and opposes the use of force to resolve disputes in the international arena. The statement continued: The Soviet Union has never threatened peace, has never threatened the freedom of Sweden, and today no one can present any "evidence" that the Soviet Union threatens peace or the national independence of Sweden. The statement then said: It is the United States, together with the imperialists of other countries, that is conducting blatant war propaganda, persecuting peaceful and democratic forces, and threatening to launch a third world war. "If criminal forces launch a new world war by attacking the Soviet Union, if Sweden is dragged into this war against the will of our peace-loving people, every Communist Party member, every sincere Swedish patriot, will have to consider it their responsibility to fight by all means against the instigators of imperialist war, to end the war and restore national independence."

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, March 20th: TASS, Helsinki: The Central Committee of the Finnish Communist Party passed a resolution on March 17th to fight for peace and for the independence of the Finnish nation. The resolution stated: The Finnish Communist Party will do everything possible to mobilize the nation's progressive forces to fight against attempts to drag Finland into the group of imperialist war instigators. The Finnish Communist Party calls on workers, working peasants, and all progressive forces in the country to fight for the elimination of unemployment, the improvement of rural conditions, Finnish-Soviet friendship, and for peace and national independence.

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, March 20th: Paris: The Moroccan Communist Party has issued a statement condemning the transfer of bases in Morocco to the despotic regime of General Juin, the Resident General of France. The statement stated: Ali Yata, the Secretary of the Moroccan Communist Party, was recently arrested for the same condemnation. This is the best proof that Juin is carrying out despotic tyranny in Morocco.
