The Second District Government of Huolu Establishes New Marriage Views
　　Guaranteeing Freedom of Marriage and Divorce
　　Widely Supported by Women

　　[Our Report] The Second District Government of Huolu resolutely safeguards women's marital autonomy, changes its dilatory work style, and promptly handles divorce and marriage cases, winning the support of the broad masses of women and the sympathy of public opinion. In the past, district staff members had unclear concepts regarding safeguarding women's marital autonomy and opposing arranged and mercenary marriages. They adopted one-sided methods of persuasion and restriction for some women seeking divorce, and for some more difficult cases, they took dilatory measures without investigation, some cases dragging on for months, causing widespread complaints from women and making it very difficult for the staff. In the past two months, due to the clarification of the principle of safeguarding women's marital freedom in thought, some new methods and new experiences have been created in dealing with specific problems. Their main practices are: (1) In the case of marriages arranged by parents in childhood, as long as one party proposes to annul the engagement, the other party is summoned to the case for resolution. If the other party refuses to appear after being summoned three times, the district will issue a judgment allowing the annulment. Those who disagree can appeal to the county government. Regarding the bride price, it is even more important to consider the specific circumstances of the woman. If she really cannot afford to return it, she may not have to. (2) The main consideration in divorce issues is the basic feelings between the two parties. If the feelings are fundamentally irreconcilable, divorce will be granted if only one party requests it. If the divorce is proposed due to instigation by outsiders or other reasons, the causes will be investigated and resolved; if they are difficult to resolve, the case will be referred to the county for resolution. Although the district government is generally very busy with its work, its handling of women's issues is now faster and more patient than in the past. Statistics for just two months show that a total of 102 cases of annulment of engagements, 27 cases of divorce, and 32 cases of free marriage were resolved. The number of cases handled in the past two months is more than double the number handled in the past six months. In Dongjiao Village alone, more than ten cases of annulment of engagements were handled. Many young women expressed their heartfelt support for the government's measures. Some said, "Only the Communist Party truly cares about us. No matter how much effort we used to put in, it was useless." "Before, we could only keep our dissatisfaction in our hearts and suffer ourselves. Now, the government supports us and resolves our problems. It's like living in two different worlds." At the same time, this approach is beginning to change the bad traditions of bride prices and arranged marriages. Wang Laohei, from Dongjiao Village in Huolu, had an eleven-year-old son. Someone suggested he arrange a marriage for him, asking for one stone of wheat. He said, "If I give grain now to arrange a marriage, and the person doesn't want to when they grow up, wouldn't it be a waste? I will never arrange a marriage for them early again." At present, the staff members of the district are increasingly confident in handling divorce and marriage issues and are now paying attention to investigating various social opinions and strengthening the research work on cases in order to make the resolution of problems more satisfactory and reasonable.

　　获鹿二区政府树立新的婚姻观点
    保障退婚结婚自由
  　广大妇女极表拥护
    【本报讯】获鹿二区区政府坚决保障妇女婚姻自主，改变拖拉作风，迅速处理离婚结婚等案件，获得广大妇女的拥护与舆论的同情。该区工作人员，由于过去对保障妇女婚姻自主，反对包办买卖婚姻的观念不明确，对有些要求离婚的妇女，采取片面的说服限制等办法，有些较难于处理的，也不调查，而采取拖拉等办法，有的案件，竟牵延数月之久，妇女怨声载道，工作人员也感到十分作难。近两月来，由于从思想上明确了保障妇女婚姻自由的原则，在处理具体问题上，也创造一些新的办法与新的经验。他们的主要作法是：（一）凡父母包办幼年订婚的婚姻，只要一方提出退婚，即召集另一方到案，加以解决，如对方抗拒连传三次仍不到案者，区里就下判决书，准许退婚。不同意的可向县府上告。关于财礼，更要看女方的具体情况，若真退不起，就可不退。（二）对离婚问题，主要看双方基本感情如何而定，感情基本无法再合的，只一方提出就准其离婚。若是因外人挑拨与其他原因而提出离婚的，则寻找原因，加以解决；不好解决的，介绍到县去解决。现在区政府一般工作虽很忙，但对妇女问题的处理，却比过去解决得迅速而且耐心了。只两个月的统计，共解决退婚案一百零二件，离婚案二十七件，自由结婚的三十二件，两个月来处理的比过去半年处理的案件要多一倍多。仅东焦一村即处理退婚案十余件。许多青年女妇对于政府这种措施，表示衷心的拥护，她们有的表示：“只有共产党才是真关心咱们，过去怎样费气闹，也不顶事。”“以前不满意只能放在心里，自己受罪，现在政府就给撑腰解决，真是活在两个世界了。”同时，这种作法开始改变着出财礼与包办婚姻的恶传统：获鹿东焦村王老黑有个十一岁的儿子，有人给他说媳妇，要他出一石麦子，他说：“现在出粮食订了亲，长大人家不愿意了还不是白搭了？我再也不给他们早说了。”目前该区工作人员，对于如何处理离婚结婚等问题，已信心倍增，现正注意调查各种社会舆论，加强对于案件的研究工作，以求问题的解决更为圆满合理。
