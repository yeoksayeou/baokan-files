Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 28th – According to a dispatch from the Dian Tong News Agency in Paris: The French General Confederation of Labor's weekly publication "Worker's Life," published on the 24th, writes that the work of restoring peaceful production in many sectors of French industry has ceased. Industry is now reverting to military production. The publication points out: "Although we still lack the majority of consumer goods, French peacetime industry is transforming into military industry." The publication lists many examples. For example, the huge machine factory "Marine Foundry" in Saint-Chamond (north of Saint-Étienne), an industrial center in the Loire department, has stopped producing tractors and train carriages and resumed the production of artillery shells. The factory in Ingreville, near Rouen, has changed from producing bicycle parts to producing light artillery ammunition. La Ferté-Macé in the Normandy peninsula and the Orne department, no longer produces kitchen utensils, but has switched to arms production. The state-owned SNECMA aircraft factory near Paris, which had already been converted to peacetime production, is now busy reassembling to manufacture light armored vehicles with heavy machine guns. The armaments factories in Toulon and Indre (a department in central France) have stopped converting to peacetime production and have resumed military production. The publication condemns this warmongering preparation as part of the "North Atlantic Treaty," which organizes an anti-Soviet crusade, and calls on French workers to stop this dangerous process and force a return to peacetime production in order to raise the national standard of living. The publication cites the example of workers at the Sagiem factory in Argenteuil, near Paris, who opposed arms production. When the factory owner attempted to stop producing manufacturing machines and switch to producing cannon parts, the workers staged a successful mass demonstration.

　　法反动政府进行军火生产
  　工人纷纷示威抗议
    【新华社陕北二十八日电】据电通社巴黎讯：二十四日出版的法国总工会的“工人生活”周刊写道，法国工业很多部门中恢复和平生产的工作已经停止。工业又正在转变为从事军事生产了。该刊指出：“虽然我们仍然缺乏多数消费品，但是，法国和平时期工业正转变为军事工业。”该刊列举了很多例子，比如，罗亚尔省的工业中心圣。沙蒙（在圣德田之北）的巨大机器厂“马林铸造厂”，已停止拖拉机和火车车辆的生产，并恢复了炮弹的生产。在卢昂附近的英克维尔的工厂，已将生产自行车零件改为生产轻炮弹药。诺曼第半岛与尔尼省的拉·佛特·马斯，已不生产厨房用具，而改为军火生产。巴黎附近业已改为和平生产的国营斯尼克马飞机厂，现正忙于重新装配，以制造附有重机枪的轻型装甲车。土伦和英德里（法国中部的一省）的军火厂，已停止转为和平生产，并重新恢复军事生产。该刊斥责这种好战的准备是组织反苏十字军的“北大西洋公约”的一部分，号召法国工人制止这一危险的进程，并迫使恢复和平时期的生产，以便提高全国生活水平。该刊指出巴黎附近阿干杜尔的萨基姆工厂工人反对进行军火生产的事例，工人们当该厂厂主企图不生产制造机而改产大炮零件时，即举行了成功的群众示威。
