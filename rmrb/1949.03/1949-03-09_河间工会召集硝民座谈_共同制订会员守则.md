Hejian Trade Union Convenes Nitre Miners' Forum
　Jointly Formulate Membership Rules
    [Hejian News] On February 15th, the city's Trade Union Nitre Industry Union took advantage of the downtime when nitre miners couldn't sweep nitre soil due to snowfall to convene a forum for all nitre miners in the city. The meeting began with current affairs education, and called on everyone to strengthen unity and pay attention to labor discipline. For example, some nitre miners used to sweep nitre soil at residences, and their attitude towards people was very poor. Some, like Sun Zhiwei, used the excuse of sweeping nitre soil to take other people's things at random, and even took a total of more than 80 jin of nitrate from the Promotion Cooperative three times.

    After the city Trade Union explained the rights and obligations of members, everyone also reviewed the phenomena of undisciplined behavior and decided to punish Sun Zhiwei. They jointly formulated the following membership rules:
    (1) Nitre miners should yield to each other and not seize nitre soil, nor should they fight each other. (2) When going to a resident's home to sweep soil, first give a notice, and patiently explain, do not be rude. (3) It is forbidden to jump over walls and dig walls to sweep soil, and it is forbidden to scrape walls with scrapers. (4) Do not take anything from the landlord, and close the door when leaving. (5) Support and actively implement government decrees, do not commit illegal acts, and do not buy or sell private nitrate. (6) Abide by trade union discipline.

　　河间工会召集硝民座谈
  　共同制订会员守则
    【河间讯】二月十五日市职工会硝业工会利用下雪后硝民不能扫硝土的空闲，召集全市硝民进行座谈，会中首先进行了时事教育，并号召大家加强团结、注意劳动纪律，如以往有的硝民到住家去扫硝土，对人态度很不好，甚至如孙志位借扫硝土为名乱拿别人的东西，并三次拿了推进社的硝共八十多斤。
    市工会讲解了会员的权利与义务后，大家对不守纪律的现象也作了检讨，决定给孙志位以处分。并共同制订了会员守则如下：
    （一）硝民与硝民要互相尽让，不霸占硝土，不你争我夺。（二）到住户家去扫土先要通知一声，要耐心解说，不要耍态度。（三）不准跳墙和挖墙扫土，不准用刮子刮墙。（四）不拿房东的一点东西，出门要关上门。（五）拥护与积极执行政府法令，不作犯法事不买卖私硝。（六）遵守工会纪律。
