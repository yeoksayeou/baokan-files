Xinhua News Agency, Beiping, March 29th: Electronegative News Agency, Prague: Zachariadis, General Secretary of the Greek Communist Party, made a statement on Free Greece Radio on the 27th, calling on the Greek people to rise up and wage a sharper struggle against the imperialist lackeys. Zachariadis said in the statement: The lackeys of American and British imperialism in Greece and the Balkan countries are engaging in frantic activities. The purpose of these activities is to more viciously undermine the interests of Greece, Albania, and other people's democracies that are fighting for peace and freedom alongside the Soviet Union. Zachariadis said: The Greek people, cooperating with all peace-loving countries, will know how to stop plans to launch a new war. Therefore, the central slogan of the Greek liberation war, now more obvious than ever before, is: Fight to defeat the imperialist lackeys, and fight for the liberation of Greece.

    号召人民坚决斗争击败帝国主义走狗
    【新华社北平二十九日电】电通社布拉格讯：希腊共产党总书记萨查和阿第斯于二十七日在自由希腊电台发表声明，号召希腊人民起来向帝国主义走狗作更尖锐的斗争。萨查利阿第斯在声明中说：美英帝国主义在希腊和在巴尔干各国的走狗正在疯狂的活动。这些活动的目的，在于更凶恶地破坏希腊、阿尔巴尼亚及其他与苏联在一起为和平与自由而斗争的人民民主国家的利益。萨查利阿第斯说：同一切爱好和平的国家合作的希腊人民，是会知道如何阻止发动新战争计划的。因此，希腊解放战争的中心口号，现在比过去任务时候都更明显的是：为击败帝国主义走狗，为争取希腊的解放而斗争。
