　　Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 18th—Industrial and mining enterprises in Shenyang, Harbin, Fushun, and other places are now systematically organizing technical studies to improve production and cultivate technical workers. The Harbin Machinery Iron Factory has established a Technical Research Association, focusing on working methods, practical difficulties encountered in production, how to identify various materials and their properties, and how to use tools and machines. After the red furnace and furnace sand groups of the factory raised problems encountered in production for research, experienced workers and technicians exchanged opinions, and many smelting and sticking methods were solved by doing and researching at the same time, and the quality of finished products was improved. The factory decided that any member who has made outstanding achievements in research may be rewarded as a model researcher after being nominated by the research association and approved by the factory management committee. Since the Fushun Coal Mine Bureau established a technical research association in January, the number of members has grown to more than 400 by mid-February. The scope of research is divided into eight groups: mining and metallurgy, machinery, chemical industry, medicine, agriculture and forestry, statistics, accounting, and factory management. The oil plant of the mine is actively translating relevant information to improve the oil production technology and theoretical knowledge of its employees, and is preparing to set up various technical training courses for manufacturing lubricating oil, gasoline, sulfuric acid, and paraffin wax. According to the opinions of the workers' representatives, Shenyang Automobile No. 11 Factory organized a spare-time technical training class for employees. Technicians and experienced workers serve as teachers, adopting a teaching method that emphasizes practical technology to help workers learn automobile structure, repair methods, electrical engineering, and fault inspection methods. The enthusiasm of the workers for learning is very high.
