　　Model Female Worker Yan Jinfen
　　Guo Yuan
　　During the events in Shijiazhuang the year before last, under enemy bombings and severe destruction, the Da Xing Cotton Mill was rebuilt by the people. As soon as the factory started operating, Jinfen and her younger sister Xiaoduo came to work. First, they sewed doors and windows in the packing department, then were transferred to the spinning room to tend the machines.

　　When she first arrived, she was afraid to talk to the cadres, blushing whenever she spoke, and always acting shy in front of people. However, she worked very diligently, never slacking off, never taking leave, and never quarreling with her sisters. Seeing her positive attitude and good skills, the administration let her do doffing.

　　Later, the workers' awareness gradually increased, and the cotton mill began to establish the New Democratic Youth League. Jinfen's younger sister Xiaoduo progressed quickly and actively requested to join the League. However, when someone encouraged Jinfen to join, she refused. She even said to the other sisters, "Let's not join!" Xiaoduo criticized her, saying that her mind was too rigid and that she should join the League to study. But she still couldn't understand and couldn't make up her mind.

　　One day, several comrades from the factory came to visit her home. Jinfen's mother talked to everyone about the bitter days of the past. Since the great flood that year, pushing Jinfen and her sisters on a wheelbarrow, they escaped from their hometown - Ji County, Hebei Province, and the whole family had been wandering in Jin County and Shijiazhuang for a long time. Later, Jinfen's second sister and her father both died, leaving them, mother and three daughters. Life became even more miserable, with short food and clothing. It was so difficult that they couldn't survive. At that time, Jinfen was only twelve years old and went to work in the cotton mill, working twelve hours a day. When she got home, she was so tired that she couldn't even climb onto the bed. Later, she got sick from exhaustion and was fired by the cotton mill! When Jinfen's mother spoke about the sad parts, Jinfen, who was hiding in the corner of the room, couldn't help but cry. At this time, thinking about the past and looking at today, she began to feel agitated in her heart. After a few days, she saw that many of the best young workers and her close sisters were joining the League one after another. She became even more envious, only hating that her education was low and she couldn't keep up with others. But everyone was willing to help her, and she was allowed to go to every meeting. In this way, her mind gradually opened up, and she resolutely requested to join the League. As a result, she and Xiaoduo were approved by the Youth League Committee and became glorious members.

　　In August, the cotton mill launched a "car-splitting competition," and many young female workers threw themselves into this upsurge. In order to win the red flag, Jinfen often said to the car workers in their group, "Let's not deliberately go to the toilet, and let's not let a single thread break." But for the first two times, for some reason, they didn't hang the red flag, and she was so anxious that she didn't want to eat dinner or sleep when she got home.

　　From then on, in her shift, she didn't eat or drink, and kept watching the car, cleaning the car, and mending the thread. When it was time to eat, she often let others go to eat, while she watched the car and worked desperately. The administrator and assistant often advised her to pay attention to her health, but she persisted, and finally, through her efforts, they won the red flag for the third time.

　　Because she was fast at doffing, good at helping with the car, worked steadily, and knew how to unite workers, the administration promoted her to be a instructor.

　　After the party of Da Xing Cotton Mill went public last winter, many workers requested to join the party. At this time, Jinfen's understanding was different from when she had not joined the League. She understood that the Communist Party was the party of the working class, and quickly made up her mind to join the party and enter her own home. After joining the party, she became even more active in her work and had a stronger sense of responsibility.

　　In order to carry out her work, the administration transferred Jinfen from Class A to Class B. Later, in the fine spinning workshop of Class A, a "empty tube incident" occurred during the car-splitting competition. A doffing leader, in order to falsely report the output, organized the doffing workers to collectively put empty tubes into the yarn bags. This matter was exposed, but the doffing leader stubbornly denied it and did not allow other workers to tell the truth.

　　Thus, this matter could not be resolved quickly, until Jinfen was transferred back to Class A, and with her unity and help, the problem was clarified.

　　A doffing worker in the group, Xu Xianglan, began to approach her, constantly talking about the Youth League. With her help, Xu Xianglan progressed quickly, and the sisters had good feelings for each other. Xu Xianglan helped her to approach those doffing workers, and later, when they talked monthly, they gradually talked about the empty tube incident. A very honest female worker, Ma Yuejie, said, "When I was picking up tubes on car number seventeen, the doffing leader really asked me to put in empty tubes!" Later, other doffing workers also admitted it one after another. Jinfen then mobilized them to admit their mistakes at the meeting. Everyone unanimously admitted that the doffing leader had instructed them to put in empty tubes. The incident, which had been delayed for more than a month, was finally brought to light. Everyone began to actively produce again, and Xu Xianglan also automatically joined the New Youth League.

　　Now Jinfen is still working as an instructor in the fine spinning Class A. Once she goes to work, she buries herself in production, running around in the workshop like the doffing workers and car workers, busily laboring. But she is always so diligent, so responsible, and so caring for others.

　　In the Da Xing Cotton Mill, she was even elected by the workers as a representative to attend the municipal women's congress and the workers' congress. Recently, she was elected by the workers as a model worker.

　　模范女工阎金芬
    郭远
    前年石家庄事，在敌机轰炸与严重破坏下，大兴纱厂被人民重建起来了，工厂刚一开工，金芬和她妹妹小朵就来上工了。先在打包部缝门窗，后调细纱看车。
    初来的时候，她不敢和干部说话，一说话就脸红，见了人老是羞羞答答的。可是，她干活挺踏实，从来没有耍过滑，也没有告过假，更没有跟姐妹们吵过嘴。行政上见她积极，手艺又好，便让她落纱。
    后来，工人们的觉悟逐渐地提高了，纱厂开始建立新民主主义青年团。金芬的妹妹小朵进步很快，积极要求入团。可是，有人劝金芬入团，却被金芬拒绝了。她还同别的姐妹们讲，“咱们都不在！”小朵批评她，说她脑筋这么死，应该参加团学习学习才好。但她还是解不开，拿不定主意。
    有一天，工厂里来了几个同志，到她家里探望。金芬她母亲和大家谈起了过去的辛酸日子。自从那年发大水，用一辆独轮小车推着金芬姐妹，逃出了故乡——河北冀县，全家便长久流落在晋县、石家庄。后来，金芬她二姐和她父亲都死掉了，剩下她们娘女四口人，日子过得更加凄惨、短吃少穿，实在困难得没法过。当时，金芬才十二岁，便进纱厂上工，一天干十二个钟头的活，回到家里，累的边炕也爬不上去，后来累的有病了，还叫人家纱厂给开除了！当金芬她母亲讲到伤心的地方，躲在屋角里的金芬也忍不住哭起来了。这时候，想了想过去，看了看今天，她心眼里开始激动起来。过了一些日子，她看到许多干活最好的青年与自己要好的姐妹们，都纷纷入团，她更加羡慕，只恨自己文化低，赶不上人家。但大家都愿意帮助她，每逢开会，都让她去，这样，她的脑筋渐渐开朗了，也坚决要求入团。结果，和小朵一起被团委批准了，成为光荣的团员。
    八月间，纱厂开展“分车竞赛”，许多青年女工都投入这个热潮里。金芬为了争红旗，常对他们组的车工说：“咱们谁也不故意跑茅房，一个头儿也不让它断，”可是头两次，不知为什么他们没有卦上红旗，急的她回家后，边饭也不想吃，觉也睡不着。
    从此她在班上，饭也不吃，水也不喝，一直看着车，清洁着车，接着头，该吃饭的时候，她常常让旁人去吃，自己看着车，拚命的干着。管理员、助理员常劝她，叫她好好注意身体，但她一直坚持下来，结果，终于在她努力之下，第三次她们得到了红旗。
    因为她，落纱快，帮车帮的好，干活踏实，会团结工人，行政上又提升她当了指导工。
    去冬备战以后大兴纱厂的党公开，许多工人要求入党，这时候的金芬和未入团的时候认识不同了，她了解共产党是工人的政党，很快地拿定主意，参加了党，走进自己的家。入党以后，她工作更加积极，责任心也强了。
    为了开展工作，行政上把金芬从甲班调到乙班。后来甲班细纱间，在分车竞赛当中，发生了一件“放空管事件”。有一个落纱长为了虚报出数，组织落纱工集体向纱袋里放空穗管，这件事，被人揭发了，但那个落纱长死不承认，并不让其他工人说实话。
    这样，使这件事情不能很快的得到解决，直到金芬又调回甲班，在她团结和帮助下，才把问题搞清楚了。
    组里有一个落纱工许香兰，开始接近她，断不了讲青年团的事，许香兰在她帮助下，进步的很快，姐妹们感情也好，许香兰帮助她和那几个落纱工接近，后来月谈起来，才渐渐的谈到放空管的事，一个很老实的女工马月姐说：“我在十七号车上拣管时，落纱长真的让我搁空管来！”后来其他落纱工，都陆续承认了，金芬又动员她们在会上承认错误，大家一致承认落纱长布置他们搁空管。延缓了一个多月的事件，才弄得水落石出。大家又开始积极生产，许香兰也自动参加了新青团。
    现在金芬，依然在细纱甲班当指导工。一上了班，便埋在生产里，和落纱工、车工一样在车间跑来跑去，忙录的劳动着。但她总是那样勤快，那样负责，对旁人又是那样关心。
    在大兴纱厂，她连被工人选为出席本市妇女代表大会、职工代表大会的代表。最近，她又被工人选举为模范工。
