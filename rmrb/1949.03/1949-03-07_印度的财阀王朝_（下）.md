India's Financial Oligarchy (Part 2)
    By A. Leontiev

    It is precisely for the sake of these collective interests that the government has refused to regulate prices, with the result that the cost of living is rising and the working masses are becoming increasingly impoverished, the government's most recent decision to abolish controls on the sugar industry was the direct result of pressure from the sugar refiners' association, headed by Birlas.

    Economic ministers are becoming tools of these magnates and their agents. The recently resigned Economic Minister, Bhubabha, was publicly accused of having his ministry as an appendage of the Birla concern. Large sums of government money were at Birla's disposal, and his company regularly received priority trade licenses and other official privileges. Finance Minister Sir S. Shetty also directly represents commercial interests.

    The plan for the reconstruction of Indian industry and the economy along "national lines", as announced by the leaders of the Congress Party, is entirely in line with the basic requirements of the financial groups. Despite Nehru's recent promises, the plan rejects the nationalisation of industry, which will remain in private hands for the next ten years, after which the question will be "reconsidered". The government has only retained the right to set up new factories itself, and the monopoly of the armaments industry and railways, which already belong to the state. The rights of the trusts are guaranteed. The new sectors of industry will be developed mainly by public-private joint ventures.

    This decision is entirely in line with the ambitions of the Indian concerns. They plan to use government funds to develop their own exclusive enterprises. The leaders of the Indian financial groups are resolutely opposed to nationalisation and have suggested that 12.2 billion rupees should be invested in industry over five years, of which 38 per cent would be private capital and the remaining 62 per cent would be financed by government funds.

    The industries set up with this money will fall into the hands of monopoly capital.

    This is precisely the path that the Congress Party government is taking. The "Air India International", established in Bombay in April this year (1948), is a typical example. The government guarantees all losses of the trust and approves its enjoyment of all state privileges. However, the government does not own even half of the shares - most of them go to the Bombay magnate Tata. He was appointed chairman and is the sole master of the trust. He has also secured a seat on the board of directors of the government aircraft factory in Bangalore.

    The first step in establishing a locomotive manufacturing industry in India is to transfer the existing government factories to Tata. The planned Indian Shipping Company, with a capital of 100 million rupees, most of which is to be borne by the government, will be run by H. Wolchand, the owner of "New India Steam Navigation Ltd." and the head of one of the ten largest financial families.

    The Indian financial groups, who accumulated their wealth under British colonial rule, are now trying to increase their wealth under Congress Party rule. However, the technical and financial conditions of the giants of Calcutta and Bombay are too poor, and their political base is too weak, to enable them to implement their huge plans to exploit the country without seeking help from others. In fact, they already have other forces behind them. The young Indian financial groups have joined forces with the British colonial capital, which has ruled India for centuries, and with the American financial groups. This is how the all-powerful monopoly capital is being formed in India under the protection of the Congress Party.

    British capital continues to dominate India to this day, penetrating every crevice of its economic structure. Significantly, British investment in India, which was estimated at £1 billion before the war, has not actually shrunk, even though Britain lost half of its overseas assets during the Second World War. According to the London Financial Times, British commercial investment in India has fallen by only £138 million. But even this loss has been more than offset by the continued expansion of British companies in India and the inflow of new capital over the years. The giants of the "City" (the London business district, equivalent to Wall Street in the United States - translator) may give up their positions in various places, but they will certainly not give up their positions in India. Even when Britain itself was threatened with mortal danger, they did not abandon this bastion of British imperialism.

    After the war, the "City's" policy in India - a policy of brutal exploitation of 400 million Indian people - remained unchanged. Their tactics have changed. The days when British monopoly capitalists could openly and unrestrictedly control India are over. The new era calls for more carefully disguised methods of colonial exploitation, and this is, in fact, the true meaning of the Labour Party's "new" colonial policy. The simplest disguise is to "Indianise" the brand of British capital by recruiting national capitalists as junior partners, or even nominally as major partners. British monopoly capitalists provide the main technical equipment and a strong and complete colonial exploitation apparatus. The Indian financial groups, prepared to achieve their lust for profit and consolidate their power by any means, attach national labels to Indianised British companies and concerns and guarantee them the political support of the Congress Party ruling group.

    The combination of monopoly British capital and large Indian companies is proceeding at a rapid pace. In the past year alone, Indian industrial and financial giants have raised 1 billion rupees to buy shares in British concerns or their Indian branches. These giants are becoming partners in the large British colonial companies. Representatives of those companies were, only a few years ago, still insisting on the ruthless suppression of the Indian national movement. Of the four oldest and largest colonial companies in India ("East India Company" successors, directly controlling 200 companies in India), three ("Gillanders Arbuthnot & Co.", "Baird & Co." and "Martin Burn & Co.") have already set aside some shares for newly admitted Indian partners. The majority of shares remain in British hands.

    Similarly, Indian capitalists are establishing close ties with the large British monopoly capitalists. In establishing the automobile industry in India, Birla has joined forces with "British Ford" - Lord Nuffield. Nuffield is one of the richest of the British giants and is notorious for his extreme imperialist tendencies. The new "Birla-Nuffield Trust" will not produce cars in India, but will simply assemble the parts imported from Britain. Thus, the vast majority of the profits will remain in the hands of the British partners, while Birla will be allowed to exploit Indian consumers with government subsidies.

    The Tata Group is also in collusion with "Imperial Chemical Industries", the most powerful of the British monopoly capitalists.

    Indian monopoly capital, hiding behind the scenes of the Congress Party, is in fact mainly Anglo-Indian capital. But the Indian financial groups are also eager to establish relations with a more powerful and belligerent partner - US monopoly capital - in the international and commercial arena. American capitalists have only just begun to encroach on India, and Wall Street, which is promoting an Asian Marshall Plan, has not concealed the fact that it includes India, along with China and Japan, in its future sphere of influence. India is full of representatives of American trusts and banks, who are planning massive investments in India, enticing Indian industrialists and financiers with sweet words.

    Many Indian companies have already entered into direct agreements with American trusts, and the Birla Bank is in direct communication with the New York "Citibank". This New York bank has also become the financial agent for Tata's new aviation trust. The newspapers of Birla, Dalmia and other Indian giants have welcomed "American aid" in a big way, and in particular, in the plan to reorganise the Indian economy, Birla has suggested that at least 42 per cent of the new capital investment in India should be foreign investment, mainly American investment. He has proposed a huge sum of more than 5 billion rupees. The final deal between the US-China-Indian monopoly capitalists seems possible from all sides. Due to India's unlimited natural wealth, cheap labour, inexhaustible markets and, last but not least, its value as a strategic base, American capital is involuntarily attracted to India. American pressure on India's political and commercial groups is constantly increasing. The Indian financial groups, for their part, are counting on a steady stream of dollars and equipment supplies on credit to enable them to expand their business and strengthen their power to an unprecedented extent. They are also motivated by other, even more ambitious, goals. The greedy eyes of the commercial giants, which had once been focused on Patel and Nehru, are now staring beyond India. They dream of becoming the main agents of British, and especially American, capital in exploiting the whole of Asia, and mainly India's neighbours: Indonesia, Malaya, Vietnam, Burma, Siam, Iran, Afghanistan, the Middle Eastern Arab countries, and even Egypt.

    Representatives of Calcutta and Bombay capital are stubbornly recommending this plan in the Nehru government as the basis of Indian commercial policy. Speaking in Delhi on November 9th last year (1947), Commerce Minister Bhubabha urged Indian industrialists and financiers to seize the sphere of influence lost by Japanese capital after the Second World War, to invade Southeast Asia, Central Asia and the Middle East, as far as Egypt. According to this ambitious plan, capitalist India is to become Japan's successor in Asia. It is no longer a secret that this tendency is reflected in the current foreign policy of the Nehru government. As we know, the essence of the widely publicised "Nehru Plan" is that the South-East countries, including India, Pakistan, Burma, Malaya, India, Siam and other South-East Asian countries, should form an economic, or even military, bloc under his protection.

    On May 23rd this year (1948), US Ambassador to India, Grady, suddenly made a statement publicly approving the "Nehru Plan", declaring that it was in line with the Asian Marshall Plan. Grady's speech was followed by the election of the Chairman of the United Nations Economic Commission for the Far East and Asia. The chairman-elect was Dr. Matthai - Minister of Railways and Transport in Nehru's cabinet and chairman of the Bombay Tata Company. The Secretary-General of the Commission was P. S. Lokanathan - formerly an employee of Birla. In his first statement, Matthai suggested that an agency should be linked to the establishment of a UN Economic Commission to "plan" the "economy" of each Asian country. In close contact with "institutions that are able to obtain this kind of assistance", the Commission is to decide what economic and financial assistance each country needs. Explaining the significance of this agency, the Secretary-General of the Commission, Lokanathan - a representative of the Birla Company - declared: "It is an iron fact that Asia can only progress with external assistance. Under the present circumstances, this external assistance can mainly only be American."

    ● This is how the Indian monopoly capital group has colluded with the Nehru government, which is now openly proposing a concrete plan for the Marshallization of Asia. Birla, Tata and their political allies are rushing to take the initiative in forcing the Asian nations to become slaves of US imperialism, believing that they will share a leading role in the implementation of this plan.

    The leading policymakers of American policy have not yet indicated that they are prepared to entrust India with the leadership role in Asia, and the fact that they are systematically restoring the strength of Japanese capital and Japanese militarism has not diminished the sharpness of their new Indian agents. On the contrary, the threat of Japanese competition, so skilfully put forward by the United States, is stimulating the founders of the "Nehru Plan" to intensify their activities. The commercial groups of Calcutta and Bombay are talking about setting up a special company to economically exploit India's neighbours - a syndicate with a capital of 200 million rupees has been set up in Batavia to participate in the "industrialisation" of Indonesia, of which 49 per cent of the shares belong to Indian industrialists and financiers. The real aim of Dr Matthai's proposal is to prepare the way for US monopoly capitalists to seize Asian countries under the banner of the "Nehru Plan", with Indian compradores sharing a certain amount of the profits.

    This is the policy of India's new "national" financial groups and their higher-level protectors - a policy that will once again drive India into the slavery of foreign capital. The leaders of the Congress Party are exerting their will to extinguish the national liberation movement and all its ideals. Their aim is to consolidate and strengthen India's colonial-feudal capitalist regime. They are impeding the free development of India's productive forces by shackling the national economy with the fetters of foreign monopoly capital. Linked to the princes and landlords, they are striving to tighten the reins of lifelong servitude around the necks of Indian peasants.

    Blinded by imperialist ambitions, the "Nehru Plan", etc., they are linking India's destiny to the policy of war-mongers, striving to cut off the Indian people from their natural allies - other freedom-loving nations, and to sow the seeds of national hatred once again on the Asian continent. Fearing the growth of progressive forces, they are urging the government to attack the working class and workers' organisations - the main force in the national liberation struggle. Birla's newspapers are urging a complete ban on strikes and the enactment of anti-labour legislation along American lines. But in this trend of reactionary recklessness, the financial groups of the Congress Party are meeting with increasing opposition from the masses. The masses' struggle for genuine national independence is increasingly coinciding with their struggle for their basic needs and demands and against the exploitation of the financial groups.

　　印度的财阀王朝　（下）
    Ａ·里奥尔尼夫  作
    正是为了这些集体的利益，政府才拒绝管制物价，结果是生活费上腾，劳动群众正愈趋贫困中。政府最近的决定废除对制糖业的管制，乃系以拜尔拉为首的炼糖商协会的直接压力所致。
    各经济部长正变成了这些巨头及其代理人的工具。最近辞职的经济部长布哈巴哈，被公众控斥其经济部是拜尔拉康采恩的附属物。政府的款项大笔大笔地随拜尔拉处置，而他的公司经常优先取得贸易牌照和其他官方特权。财政部长Ｓ·车堤爵士，也是直接代表商业利益的。
    国大党诸领袖宣布的，沿着“民族路线”的印度工业与经济重建计划，完全符合财阀们的基本要求。尽管尼赫鲁最近曾许下诺言，但该计划拒绝工业国有化，今后十年内，工业仍操纵私人手中，十年后“再考虑”这个问题。政府仅保留了自己开办新工厂的权利，以及早已属于国家的军火工业和铁路的垄断权。托拉斯的权利得到了保证。工业的新部门，主要将由公私合股的公司开发。
    这个决定，完全符合了印度各康采恩的满怀野心。它们计划用政府的基金来发展自己的独占事业。印度财阀的领袖们决然反对国有化，并且建议，在五年内应在工业中投资一百二十二亿卢比，其中私人资本将占百分之三十八，余下的百分之六十二由政府的基金负担。
    用这些钱开办的工业将落在独占资本的手中。
    这正是国大党政府在走着的道路。今（一九四八）年四月在孟买创立的“印度国际航空公司”便是典型的例子。政府担保这个托拉斯的一切损失，批准其享受国家的一切特权。然而政府却占不到一半的股份——大部分落到孟买的巨富塔塔的手里。他被委命为董事长，是该托拉斯的唯一主宰。他又在班加罗尔的政府飞机工厂的三个董事中，谋得一席。
    在印度建立机车制造工业，第一步是将现有的政府工厂转移到塔塔公司手中。所计划的印度航业会社，资本达一亿卢比，大部分由政府负担，将由Ｈ·窝尔千德经营，他是“新印度轮船航运有限公司”的老板，是十大财阀家族中之一族的首脑。
    在英国殖民统治下，积累起他们的财富的印度财阀，现又图谋在国大党统治下增殖其财富。但是，加尔各答和孟买的巨头们的技术、财政条件是太差了，而且他们的政治基础也太弱了，弱到无法使他们能不求助他人便能实现其剥削国家的庞大计划。事实上，他们早有其他力量作后盾。年青的印度财阀已和统治印度多世纪的英国殖民地资本，以及美国的金融集团结合在一起。全能的独占资本，在国大党的保护下，就是这样在印度形成的。
    英国资本迄今继续统治着印度，深入到她的经济机构的每道隙缝里。有意义的是，英国资本在印度的投资，在战前估计已达十万万英镑，实际上并未减缩，虽然英国在第二次大战中丧失了一半的海外资财。据伦敦的“金融时报”称，英国在印度的商业投资仅减少了一亿三千八百万镑。但甚至连这个损失，亦已由其数年来在印度的英国公司的继续扩充及新资本的流入抵偿了十之八九。“城”（伦敦商业区，相当于美国的华尔街——译者）的巨头们或放弃他们在各地的阵地，但定然不会放弃他们在印度的阵地。甚至当英国本身受到致命危险的威胁时，他们亦未放弃英帝国主义的这个堡垒。
    战后，“城”的巨头们在印度的政策（一个残忍剥削四万万印度人民的政策）丝毫未改。他们的策略改变了。英国独占资本家能够明目张胆地无限制的统制印度的时代已过去了。新时代要求更小心伪装起来的殖民地剥削方法，事实上，这是工党帝国主义的“新”殖民地政策的真义。最简单的伪装手法是，以招纳民族资本家作小东家，甚至名义上使之为大东家的方法，把英国资本的招牌“印度化”。英国独占资本家提供了主要的技术装备和一套强固、完整的殖民地剥削机构。准备以任何手段来达到其利欲和巩固其权力的印度财阀，给印度化的英国公司和康采恩打上民族招牌，并且保证它们得到国大党统治集团的政治支持。
    独占英国资本家与印度的大公司的结合，正以飞快的速度进行着。单是去年，印度的工业和金融巨头，拿出了十亿的卢比来收买英国各康采恩或其印度分行的股票。这些巨头正变成为英国的大殖民地公司的伙伴。那些公司的代表仅在几年前犹坚持无情的镇压印度的民族运动。英国在印度的四家最老、最大的殖民地公司（“东印度公司”的承继者，直接控制了印度的二百家公司）中，有三家（“吉尔兰达斯——亚尔布斯诺脱公司”，“贝尔德公司”和“马丁——贝恩斯公司”已划出一部分股票给新接纳的印度伙伴。大部分股票仍在英国人手中。
    与此相类，印度资本家正与英国的大独占资本建立起密切关系。拜尔拉在印度建立汽车工业中，与“英国福特”——尼尔费得勋爵结伙。尼尔费得是英国巨头中最富的一个，并以极端的帝国主义倾向而臭名远扬。新的“拜尔拉——尼尔费得托拉斯”将不在印度生产汽车，而只是把英国输入的各部分装合起来。因而利润底绝大部分将仍在英国伙伴的手中，同时，被允许拜尔拉将在政府的补贴下剥削印度消费者。
    塔塔集团亦和英国独占资本家中最强大的“帝国化学工业”同样勾结起来。
    躲在国大党幕后活动的印度独占资本，事实上主要是英——印资本。但印度财阀亦急于要在国际及商业竟技场上，和一位更强大、好战的伙伴——美独占资本建立起关系。美国资本家才刚刚开始侵入印度，已经宣传一个亚洲马歇尔计划的华尔街，并未掩饰它把印度与中、日同列入其未来势力范围内的事实。印度充满美国托拉斯和银行的代表，他们计划着大量投资印度，甘言诱惑印度工业家和金融家。
    许多印度公司已直接与美国托拉斯缔订协定，拜尔拉银行直接与纽约“花旗银行”勾通。这家纽约银行也变成塔塔的新航空托拉斯的财政代理人。拜尔拉、达尔米亚及其印度巨头的报纸，大事欢迎“美援”，最特殊的是，在改组印度经济的计划中，拜尔拉建议在印度的新资本投资中，至少应邀请外国投资百分之四十二，主要是美国的投资。他提议五十亿卢比以上的巨款。美中印独占资本家间的最后成交，从各方面看来，已有可能。由于印度底无限的自然财富、低廉的劳动力、不匮的市场，和最后及同样重要的，印度在作为战略基地中的价值，美国资本不由自主地被吸引到印度来。美国对印度的政治、商业集团的压力，不断增加。印度财阀，对本身方面，计算着在信贷下源源添入的美元和装备供应，将能使他们扩充其商业和加强他们的权力到前所未见的程度上。他们亦为其他，甚至是更野心的目的所刺激。曾经集中在巴特尔和尼赫鲁身上的商业巨头的贪婪眼睛，已凝视着印度之外。他们整天梦想着变成英国，特别是美国剥削全亚洲，而且主要是印度的邻邦：印尼、马来、越南、缅甸、暹罗、伊朗、阿富汗、中东阿拉伯诸国，甚至连埃及也在内的资本的主要代理人。
    加尔各答和孟买资本的代表，正在尼赫鲁政府中顽固的推荐这个计划作为印度商业政策的基础。商业部长布哈巴哈于去（一九四七）年十一月九日在德里演说时，曾力促印度的工业家和金融家攫取日本资本在第二次大战后丧失的势力范围，侵入东南亚、中亚及中东，直抵埃及。按照这个野心勃勃的计划，资本主义印度要成为日本在亚洲的继承人。这已不算是秘密了，这种倾向反映在尼赫鲁政府目前的外交政策上。如我们所知道的，广为吹嘘的“尼赫鲁计划”的本质，就是东南诸国，包括印度、巴基斯坦、缅甸、马来、印度、暹罗和其他东南亚国家，在他的保护下，成立一个经济、甚至是军事的集团。
    今（一九四八）年五月二十三日，美驻印大使格莱第突然发表谈话，公开批准“尼赫鲁计划”，宣称它与亚洲马歇尔计划相符。紧接着格莱第的演说，便是联合国远东及亚洲经济委员会的遴选主席。当选的是马太博士——尼赫鲁内阁的铁路运输部长、孟买塔塔公司的董事长。经委会的秘书长是Ｐ·Ｓ·罗加那丹——曾为拜尔拉的雇员。马太在首次发表的声明中，建议与设立一个联合国经济委员会相联的代理机构，以“计划”每个亚洲国家的“经济”。在与“能够获此种援助的机构”的密切接触下，经委会是要决定每个国家需要些什么经济及财政援助。与解释这个机构的意义同时，经委会秘书长罗加那丹——拜尔拉公司的代表，宣称：“这是铁的事实，只有得到外界的援助，亚洲才能进步。在现况下，此种外界援助主要只能是美国。”
    ●印度独占资本集团就是这样和尼赫鲁政府勾结起来，后者现在公开提出一个亚洲马歇尔化的具体计划。拜尔拉、塔塔和他们的政治盟友，在迫使亚洲民族沦为美帝国主义的奴隶中，正匆忙争取主动，相信他们将在这个计划的实现中分得领导地位。
    美国政策的首要定策者，迄今未表示准备以亚洲的领导作用委与印度，以及他们近最在有系统的恢复日本资本的力量和日本军国主义的事实并未挫减其新印度代理人的锐气。相反的，美国如此巧妙提出的日本竞争的威胁，正刺激着“尼赫鲁计划”的创始者更加强活动。加尔各答和孟买的商业集团，正谈论着设立一个经济剥削印度诸邻国的特别会社——二亿卢比资本的辛迪加巳在巴达维亚设立起来，以参与印尼的“工业化”，其中百分之四十九的股份是属于印度工业和金融家的。马太博士的建议的真正目的是，在“尼赫鲁计划”的招牌下，准备为美独占资本家攫取诸亚洲国家，印度买办则分享某种数量的利润。
    这就是印度的新“民族”财阀及其上级保护者的政策——一个将再驱使印度为外国资本的奴隶的政策。国大党诸领袖正在实行其意志的力量，要灭绝民族解放运动及其一切理想。他们的目的是巩固和加强印度的殖民地——封建资本主义的政权。他们正借着把他们和外国独占资本的梏桎加在国民经济上，妨碍着印度生产力的自由发展。连结了王公、地主们，他们正力图使终生奴役的挽辔紧缚在印度农民的颈项。
    被帝国主义野心“尼赫鲁计划”等等掩住了眼睛，他们正把印度的命运与战贩的政策相连，力图把印度人民与其天生的盟友——其他酷爱自由的民族斩断，再次在亚洲大陆上散播民族仇恨的种籽。畏惧于进步力量的成长，他们正敦促政府进攻工人阶级和工人组织——民族解放斗争中的主力军。拜尔拉的报纸力促完全禁止罢工，按照美国的范畴制定反劳工立法。但在这个反动胡为的趋势中，国大党的财阀正遇到群众日益的反对。群众的争取真正民族独立的斗争，愈益和他们的为了自己的基本需要和要求、反对财阀剥削者的斗争趋向一致。
