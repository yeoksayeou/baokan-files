　　Workers Establish New Labor Attitude
    Mentougou Coal Mining Efficiency Improves
    [This Newspaper's Report] Since liberation, the output of the three state-owned coal mining companies in Mentougou has significantly increased. Among them, the Xishan Coal Mining Company, before liberation (November of last year), had 620 coal miners per day, with a monthly output of 7,757 tons; after liberation (February), the company had 580 coal miners per day, with a monthly output of 7,982 tons. The Chengzi Coal Mining Company, last November, had 308 coal miners per day, with a monthly output of 2,069 tons; this February, the company had 147 coal miners per day, with a monthly output of 2,073 tons. It can be seen that the number of coal miners has decreased, but the average coal production efficiency has increased. Taking the Mentougou Coal Mine Company as an example, in November of last year, each worker produced 0.98 tons of coal, and in February, each worker's output increased to 1.04 tons. The basic reason for the increase in output is that the coal miners, under the education of the Party and the trade union, have raised their political awareness and begun to establish a new labor attitude. At the workers' symposium, the workers excitedly described their feelings: "Today we are liberated, our status has been improved, we are working hard for the construction of our own country, how can we not be energetic?" Jiang Zhenqing, an electrician at the Chengzi Mine, automatically picked up steel materials discarded by others from the ash pile. He said: "The mine is our own, we must cherish our own things!" Many workers often took off their shirts to hammer and load coal. All the miners can carefully pick out the stones in the coal, ensuring that the coal produced is cleaner than before. Everyone can also consciously cherish the tools. In the past, they were often lost, but since February, not a single one has been lost. The Mao Shuduo brothers' production team, newly established in March at the Mentougou Coal Mine, found it difficult to mine coal downhill. In the past, other contracting teams doing this work produced at most an average of five and a half fen per person (one cart being ten fen), but their mine signed a standard of six and a half fen per person with the company. After ten days of coal mining and settlement, the average output per person has exceeded ten fen. Because the production team workers discussed democratically, they overcame the past work methods that affected efficiency, such as in the past when going to work, everyone watched the team leader, dragging their feet and lining up. After going down the mine, those who drilled blasting holes worked while others rested. Those who loaded coal and pushed carts each managed their own affairs. Now, those who drill blasting holes go down in advance and start working immediately. Those who push carts, drill holes, and load coal automatically help each other after finishing their own work, and those who carry coal compete to carry heavy baskets. They also pay attention to saving. Other contracting teams use four liang of calcium carbide per person per shift, but they only use two and a half liang of calcium carbide per person per shift. The Xishan Coal Mine workers were not active in the past, but now they are eager to go down the mine. When it is time to get off work, they still insist on producing one more cart of coal.
    This new labor attitude is developing among all employees. Another important reason for the continuous rise in workers' production enthusiasm is that they have abolished the cruel intermediate exploitation of workers by contractors and established a reasonable system of direct contracting by coal miners. Before liberation, Xishan and Mentougou mines had a contractor system. The heads of the contractors were mostly parasitic elements with money and power who colluded with the Kuomintang bandit gang. They did not participate in any labor, but only provided some coal mining tools and contracting rooms for workers to use, and contracted coal mining from the mine. They blinded the workers in order to deduct workers' wages, bonuses, and compensation for injuries and deaths, and suppressed workers' wages. Some contractors suppressed wages for half a month, one month, or even several months without paying them, and used the money to lend at usurious rates and engage in speculative business. The open exploitation was to extract 15% to 25% from the wages each month as operating expenses (in name, it was for repairing tools). Therefore, the workers' production enthusiasm was not high.

### 工人树立新劳动态度  门头沟采煤效率提高

　　工人树立新劳动态度
    门头沟采煤效率提高
    【本报讯】门头沟三个国营煤矿公司，解放以来产量显著增加。其中西山煤矿公司，解放前（去年十一月）每日采煤工六百二十个，月产煤七千七百五十七吨；解放后（二月份），每日采煤工五百八十个，月产煤七千九百八十二吨。城子煤矿公司，去年十一月每日采煤工三百零八个，月产煤二千○六十九吨；今年二月份每日采煤工一百四十七个，月产煤二千○七十三吨。可以看出，采煤工人减少了，但平均产煤效率增高了。以门头沟煤矿公司为例，去年十一月每工产煤为○·九八吨，二月份每工产煤增为一·○四吨。产量增加的基本原因是：煤矿工人在党与工会的教育下，提高了政治觉悟，开始树立新的劳动态度。在工友座谈会上，工友们兴奋地叙述着自己的心情：“今天解放啦，地位提高了，为建设自己已的国家干啦，怎能不上劲？”城子矿电机工人姜振清，自动的从灰堆里捡回别人丢掉的钢料，他说：“矿厂是自己的了、要心疼自己的东西！”好多工友常脱了光膀子打锤装煤。全矿工友都能细心地检出煤里的石头，保证了出煤比以前干净。大家也都能自觉地爱护工具了，过去常丢失，从二月份到现在一件也没有丢过。门头沟煤矿三月新成立的毛树多兄弟生产班，采下山煤很困难，以往别的包工柜做这活地，出煤最多每人平均超不过五分五（一罐为十分），但他们矿与方订了每人平均六分五的标准，经过十天采煤结算，平均每人已超过十分。因为生产班工友们民主讨论，克服了过去影响效率的工作方法，如过去上班干活，大家观望着头子，拖拖拉拉的站队，下井后打炮眼的干活，别人歇着，装煤、推罐的各管各，现在他们打炮眼的提前下去立刻就动手，推罐、打眼、装煤的干完了自己的事，就自动的互相帮助，背煤的抢着背重筐。他们也注意节省，别的包工柜每人一班要用四两电石，他们每人一班只用二两半电石。西山煤矿工友们过去不积极，现在都是争先下井，到了下班时间，还要坚持多出一罐煤。
    这种新劳动态度，正在全体职工中发展着。另外工友生产情绪不断上升的重要原因，是因为他们已经取消了包工柜对工人残酷的中间剥削，建立了采煤工人直接包工的合理制度。西山及门头沟矿在解放前是包工柜制度，包工柜掌柜的大都是与国民党匪帮勾结的有钱有势的寄生虫，他们不参加任何劳动，只是置备一部分采煤工具与包工房，供工人使用，向矿方包工采煤。它们朦蔽工人，以便从中克扣工人的工资、奖金、伤亡抚恤金，压支工人的工资，有的柜压半月、一月，有压几个月不发，拿去放高利贷，干投机买卖。公开剥削是每月从工资中抽出百分之十五至二十五，做为经营费（名义是修理工具），因此，工人生产情绪不高。
