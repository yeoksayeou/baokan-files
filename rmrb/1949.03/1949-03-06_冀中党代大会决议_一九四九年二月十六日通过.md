    Increase Cotton and Peanut Production to Meet Urban Needs
    Organize Half of Women to Participate in Field Labor
    Plant Three Million Trees, Increase Draft Animals by 50,000
    Production Policy in Newly Liberated Areas

    All delegates first expressed their warm and heartfelt support for the analysis and decisions of the Central Committee and the North China Central Bureau regarding the current situation and the tasks for 1949, as conveyed by the Hebei Central District Committee; and guaranteed to mobilize the entire party to lead and unite the masses to implement them with a hundredfold effort. Based on the tasks instructed by the Central Committee and the Central Bureau, and the specific situation that Hebei Central has become a stable and consolidated rear area, the general and basic task of the Hebei Central Party in 1949 should be to realistically and earnestly improve agricultural production, launch a large-scale production movement to strengthen the material basis for supporting the national liberation war, appropriately improve the people's living standards, and supply the needs of urban industrial recovery and construction; to this end, it is necessary to deeply publicize the Party's policies, reward farmers for increasing production and becoming prosperous through labor, and effectively organize farmers to gradually move from a scattered individual production mode to cooperative production. Based on the above tasks, it is required that the total grain production in the district should increase by 5.3 million mu, in addition to cotton, peanuts, vegetables, and sesame, requiring an increase of 20 jin per mu on irrigated land (accounting for one-fifth of the total cultivated land) and 7 jin per mu on dry land, for a total increase of 240 million jin of grain. Plant 3 million mu of cotton (accounting for 10 percent of the district's cultivated land area), which can produce 90 million jin of ginned cotton; to increase oil production, it is also necessary to greatly increase the planting of oil crops. This year, the district should plant 2 million mu of peanuts (accounting for 6 percent of the district's cultivated land area), which can produce 500 million jin of peanuts, 300,000 mu of sesame, and strive to produce 10 million jin of hemp. In terms of handicraft and sideline production, in order to adapt to the new situation that major industrial and commercial cities such as Pingjin have been liberated, the weaving of mats and reeds, straw braid, horsehair cloth, oil extraction, vermicelli production, and chicken raising should be appropriately developed; industries such as textiles, saltpeter, and paper making should no longer be expanded, focusing on how to improve quality and ensure sales. Lye extraction, wheat stalk paper making, and earth alkali production must be converted. To ensure the realization of the above tasks, it is necessary to: 1. Mobilize the strength of the entire party to continue to implement party rectification, so as to further enhance the party's combat effectiveness and strengthen the party's leading role in production. 2. Broadly educate farmers, establish the concept of production and construction, and organize them with poor and middle peasants as the main force, under the principle of voluntary mutual benefit, implement mutual aid and cooperation in production, and organize supply and marketing cooperatives with emphasis to achieve gradual promotion, vigorously carry out labor model movements; conscientiously organize the production of families of revolutionary martyrs, soldiers, cadres, and disabled soldiers; transform landlords, lazy wives, and lazy men to increase labor force, strictly mobilize diligent work, and save manpower, animal power, and materials; at the same time, compulsory service burdens must be fair and reasonable. 3. Vigorously mobilize and organize women, and mobilize about 50 percent of the female labor force in the district to participate in certain major field labor. 4. Strengthen water conservancy work. This year, irrigation projects will be carried out in Anxin, Baxian, Renqiu, Botou, and other places, and the Jin-Gao and Fu-Ning canals will continue to be developed, so that the canal irrigation area will reach 200,000 mu this year. Dig new wells, repair old wells, purchase and repair waterwheels, and expand and restore 210,000 mu of paddy fields. Complete the dredging of the new Grand Canal, repair the downstream waterway of the Hutuo River, and improve the Tianjin-Baoding shipping line to achieve smooth passage. River defense work in the spring will focus on selecting dangerous areas for repair, and in the summer and autumn, we will vigorously prevent floods. 5. Increase and protect livestock. The district will increase livestock by 50,000 heads throughout the year, focusing on breeding. Each district is required to set up one to three breeding stations, promote individual breeding, strengthen livestock epidemic prevention and health care, and strictly prohibit the slaughter of draft animals. 6. Vigorously promote manure accumulation and increase fertilizer. The amount of manure accumulated should increase by 20 percent compared to last year. Promote one pig and one pen per household. In areas with poor habits, two households can share one pig, and in very poor areas, ten households can share one pig; and call for pressing grass fertilizer and launching manure accumulation competitions. 7. In a guided manner, improve and enhance agricultural production technology, promote and popularize seed selection and seed soaking. This year, the district will operate 30 extension farms (including existing and newly built), three breeding farms, and one experimental farm according to plan, calling for intensive cultivation and effective prevention of pests and diseases. 8. Strive to eliminate wasteland, first resolutely eliminate cultivated wasteland, transform saline-alkali land, promote and protect trees, build windbreak forests, prevent sandy wasteland, and plant more than 3 million trees throughout the year. 9. Urban production should strive to meet the needs of farmers, and massively increase the production of agricultural and sideline production tools and other necessities needed by farmers. 10. In water areas, focus on organizing the masses to massively improve water land, widely develop rice planting, mat weaving, fish farming, reed planting, hemp planting, etc. In disaster areas, vigorously promote the planting of various early-maturing crops, and promote the planned transfer of grain by the cooperative, and organize seed loans, grain loans, and loans. 11. In the newly liberated areas, due to more than ten years of damage and extortion by the enemy, the people's burdens are heavy, and the production capacity has been greatly reduced. The focus of production in these areas this year should mainly be to restore the people's ability to live and work. To this end, we must first continue to suppress the remaining bandits, stabilize social order, and initially mobilize the masses to establish, restore and consolidate our various organizations, appropriately solve the farmers' production and living materials, and initially solve the land problem. At the same time, properly solve the difficulties of some livestock and farm tools, and announce that the land leased by landlords to farmers shall be collected by whoever grows it, and whoever bears the burden, and the ownership will be determined in the future. Due to years of destruction by the enemy, there is a lot of wasteland in this area, and we must find appropriate methods to vigorously mobilize and organize the masses to eliminate wasteland. All areas that have consistently implemented our land policy will be declared still valid, and it will be pointed out that the landlord and rich peasant's counter-settlement is illegal.

    Although this year's production campaign has better conditions and foundations, there are still difficulties. Therefore, the entire party and all cadres must guarantee the realization of this task with a spirit of high and complete responsibility to the people, and the perseverance to overcome all difficulties, with a hundredfold tension and a hundredfold effort. Any slackness or paralysis is absolutely not allowed.

    今年的生产运动，我们虽已具备了更好的条件与基础，但还是有困难的，因而全党、全体干部，就必须以对人民高度的与完全负责的精神、和征服一切困难的毅力，百倍紧张、百倍努力地来保证实现，任何松懈、麻痹的现象，是绝不能允许的。
