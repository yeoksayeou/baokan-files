Southeast Asia Briefs

　　▲The Chairman of the World Student Union, Mr. Grohmann, told students in Prague on February 21st that the reactionary French government has allocated over 100 billion francs (one-third of France's total military budget for this year) as the budget for this year's war against Vietnam.
    ▲Due to the activity of the Indonesian guerrillas, the Dutch military authorities in Indonesia were forced to withdraw 18,000 military police from the combat troops and police stations in late February, specifically for guarding the US-Dutch enterprise departments in Indonesia. The Dutch News Agency admitted on February 25th that "in view of the dangerous situation in some areas," this number will be increased.
    ▲Rendton, director of the Dutch branch of the U.S. "Economic Cooperation Administration," testified before the U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee that the cost of the Dutch "occupation" of Indonesia is $350 million per year, equivalent to the total "aid" given to the Netherlands under the Marshall Plan.
    ▲After the reactionary Phibun government issued a national martial law decree on February 23, it has arrested a group of army officers who opposed Phibun, including former Assistant Interior Minister Suan. Arrests of progressive elements are also underway.
    ▲The U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee passed the appointment of Mr. Cocheran as the U.S. Ambassador to Pakistan on February 25. Mr. Cocheran is a well-known expansionist and was formerly the U.S. representative to the United Nations Indonesian Committee. On the same day, the committee passed the appointment of the U.S. Ambassador to Australia, Mr. Corwen, as the U.S. Ambassador to the Philippines, to succeed former Ambassador O'Neill.
