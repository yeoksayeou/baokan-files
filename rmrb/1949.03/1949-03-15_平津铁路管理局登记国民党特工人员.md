　　Pingjin Railway Administration Registers Kuomintang Secret Agents

　　[This newspaper dispatch] (本报讯) In order to establish revolutionary transportation order and ensure the safety of railway construction and transportation, the Pingjin Railway Administration began registering Kuomintang secret agents within the original railway system on the 14th. On the 11th, it announced, upon the order of the Military Control Commission, that all reactionary secret agent organizations within the railway system must cease activities immediately and disband. Kuomintang secret agents who surrender and register must hand over organizational credentials and weapons. The People's Government will adopt a lenient policy, granting them an opportunity to start anew, without arresting them. If they can atone for their crimes by performing meritorious service and assist the People's Government in uncovering important cases, the government will consider offering rewards. Those who refuse to register, conceal themselves, and continue counter-revolutionary activities will be severely punished once discovered.
