　　Hoping to Organize Amateur Study for Employed Youths
　　In the liberated cities, there are a large number of employed youths—most of whom were petty intellectuals struggling on the breadline in the past. They have great enthusiasm and an excessive thirst for knowledge. However, under the rule and oppression of the old society, they have always groped along the wrong path politically. Now they are willing to dedicate themselves to the revolution and hope to have the opportunity to enrich themselves and learn. However, most of them bear the burden of supporting their entire families and cannot leave their families for the time being. Especially under the supply system implemented in revolutionary organizations, participating in work or study in revolutionary organizations will make the family's livelihood a major problem that restricts their emotions. In order to solve this problem, we suggest dividing regions (e.g., based on district security units), selecting instructors, and gathering these youths to provide them with learning opportunities using their surplus production time, so that they can both produce and study, and strive for continuous progress. At the same time, under correct guidance, it can not only ensure that the learning system is systematic and orderly, but also avoid the indigestible symptoms of dogmatic learning.

### 希望组织职业青年的业余学习

　　希望组织职业青年的业余学习
    在解放后的都市里，有大部份职业青年——他们大多是过去在饥饿线上挣扎的小知识分子，他们有很大的热情和过高的求知欲，然而在旧社会的统治压迫下，始终在政治的歧路上摸索着。现在他们愿意献身于革命，希望给他们有充实自己和学习的机会。但他们大部份都担负着全家人的生活，一时尚不能离开家庭，尤其在革命机关中实行供给制度的情况下，如参加革命机关工作或学习，全家的生活将成为一个牵制情绪的大问题；为了解决这个问题，我们建议划分地区（例：以区保为单位）遴派指导人员，召集这些青年，利用他们生产的剩余时间，给予学习的机会，使他们一方面生产、一方面学习，求得不断的进步。同时，在正确的指导下，既能使学习系统不紊，且能避免教条学习的不消化病症。
