　　Tianjin Schools Undergo Preliminary Reforms
    Abolishing Reactionary Courses and Systems
    [Tianjin Telegram] Under the correct leadership of the Military Control Commission, schools have begun to implement necessary reforms. Reactionary courses such as "Party Principles," "Civics," and "Ethics" have been discontinued, and the Kuomintang's indoctrination system and military/youth league training used to bind students' thinking have been abolished. Students, now liberated, are showing unprecedented enthusiasm for learning. They are actively organizing themselves to intensify their study of New Democracy and the various policies of the Chinese Communist Party. To meet the urgent needs of workers, students, and the general public, the authorities have supplied a large amount of diverse intellectual nourishment. The *Tianjin Daily*, as the people's mouthpiece, has been particularly well-received by the general public, especially the working class. Its current circulation is nearly 50,000 copies, and demand still exceeds supply. Workers, students, and teachers are deeply aware that newspapers are no longer a pastime for the leisure class, and they all treat them as learning materials, studying them carefully. Among the ninety employees of the Dongmalu Postal First Branch, sixty have voluntarily requested subscriptions. Many agencies and organizations have established communication networks, regularly submitting articles reflecting people's lives. The circulation libraries established by the preparatory committee of the Democratic Youth Federation in various schools, as well as Xinhua Bookstore and New China Bookstore, are constantly packed with people. Tens of thousands of volumes of books and periodicals from the liberated areas have been quickly sold out. A new shipment of over 1,500 copies of Chairman Mao's "On New Democracy" was completely snapped up in less than three hours.
    [Xinhua News Agency, Beiping, 28th] More and more young students in Beiping willing to dedicate themselves to Chinese revolutionary professions are applying to the North China People's Revolutionary University, North China University, and North China Military and Political University. Among the one thousand students in the Faculty of Arts and Sciences of Northeast University, over eight hundred have applied to the above three revolutionary universities. Students from other departments of Northeast University have postponed their return home in order to apply. Within three days, from the 20th to the 22nd, Fu Jen Catholic University received 440 applications, half of whom were female students. The class union of North China College of Arts and Law issued more than 370 letters of introduction for students applying within two days. All members of the "Sun Society," a student organization at Chaoyang University, have also applied. More than two hundred students from Beiping Municipal Junior Vocational School are preparing to complete application procedures.
    [Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, 27th] The second representative meeting of the preparatory committee of the Tianjin Student Union was held on the 23rd, and representatives from four schools, including Hebei Provincial Male Middle School, Tianjin Municipal Female Middle School, Tianjin Municipal Normal School, and Private Guangdong Middle School, were elected to attend the National Student Congress. Together with the representatives from Nankai University, Hebei Provincial Institute of Technology, Hebei Provincial Female Middle School, and Private Nankai Middle School elected at the first representative meeting of the preparatory committee on the 18th (previously mistakenly reported as the Tianjin First Student Congress), Tianjin has a total of eight representatives attending the National Student Congress, representing 37,750 middle school and university students in Tianjin.
