How the Cangxian Jiefang Street Communist Youth League was Established?
    He Zili

　　Cangxian Jiefang Street has 409 households, mostly workers and poor peddlers. There are 380 young men and women, more than 80 percent of whom are poor people. The Cangxian City Construction League determined that this street was the focus.

　　When the municipal Youth League cadres came to this street in October last year to start building the league, they first conducted an investigation. Based on the demands of the masses for solving their difficult living conditions, they began to call for organizing and developing production. First, they discovered Xiao Guihua, a positive element and rickshaw puller, and Ma Dahe, a small handicraft worker, and two others. Taking them as the backbone, they carried out extensive publicity and education, coordinated organization, and helped them organize a bicycle repair shop and two saltpeter boiling groups, with a total of 15 people engaged in production.

　　At first, some people had concerns about organizing production and building the league. The municipal Youth League cadres immediately convened meetings, implemented league building education, and then Xiao Guihua, a rickshaw puller, said, "When has anything ever involved us rickshaw pullers before?" Some said, "We poor kids couldn't afford to go to school in the past." At this time, they were eager to learn culture, and the municipal Youth League cadres helped them organize a "Workers' Spare Time School," where they produced during the day and attended classes at night. Everyone was very enthusiastic about learning. In just over twenty days, the number of students increased from fifteen to thirty-one, and eleven children were also admitted. When people on the street saw that they were learning very well, they gave them an electric light, a blackboard, and chalk. The municipal Youth League cadres also led them to establish a blackboard newspaper, a broadcasting station, and a club. Later, the number of students gradually increased to more than seventy.

　　After their class consciousness was initially raised through learning, the municipal Youth League cadres induced everyone to consider building the country. They taught the Youth League textbook in the workers' spare time school, including "The Nature and Tasks of the League," "Why Build the Country," and "The Conditions for Joining the League." They also held mass meetings, group meetings, and individual training and education to implement the idea of league building, and widely carried out league building deliberations. After half a month, most of the active young people had a preliminary understanding of league building, but a few were afraid that joining the league would delay production. In response to these ideological situations, they continued to implement education and correct erroneous understandings. Liu Ziyi said, "If I join the league, I will do a good job and do all kinds of work first." Then they held a meeting to discuss the conditions for joining the league. Some said, "You have to be active in production!" Some said, "You have to be good at studying!" Some said, "You can only join the league if you play an exemplary role in your work and serve the people." Yin Baozhong, a young poor peasant, said, "I used to be so poor that no one paid attention to me. No one would even shave my head even if I paid them. Now, under the leadership of the Communist Party, I have turned over a new leaf. We can take care of things on the street. I want to join the league and do a good job." Based on the conditions for joining the league, they first approved three workers and one poor peasant to join the league, and announced the four people who had joined the league at a youth mass meeting. Later, they developed three more people to join the league through individual recruitment.

　　In order to expand the influence, the youth representatives temporarily selected from various streets and street cadres were invited to participate in the induction ceremony. The municipal party committee also participated. The meeting was solemnly and solemnly arranged, and the seven league members solemnly vowed their future direction and aspirations, to obey the leadership, abide by discipline, etc. The branch was elected on the spot. Finally, the municipal party committee explained the tasks of the league and the organizational life, and the relationship with the masses. Hu Junde, a cadre from Libaisi Street, said after listening to the lecture, "Jiefang Street has established a Communist Youth League. When I go back to our street, I will also establish one. I hope other streets will also establish one."

　　The poor peasant Liu Xiaohei was gluttonous and lazy, and he also asked to join the league. In order to transform him, the league branch first borrowed a handcart for him to help him sell vegetables and make pancakes, and at the same time, closely educated him. In two months, he had gradually transformed into a young man who actively worked.

　　After the establishment of the Youth League, the young people worked very actively. When they finished the land reform and guarded the floating wealth, they slept on the roof in the cold winter without complaining, so that the materials did not suffer any loss. They also helped more than 20 young people such as Liu Hai and Wu Wenxiang to organize vegetable picking and pancake shops. Wu Wenxiang and others organized a transportation team and also asked the Youth League to help. The workers' spare time school insisted on attending classes on time. Young people who were illiterate in the past were able to recite and write the first three lessons of the literacy textbook in just over ten days. During the Spring Festival, they organized a Yangko team to carry out cultural and recreational propaganda, and swept the yards, carried water, and hung lanterns for military families. However, they have not done enough to unite the vast number of young people, and they need to continue to work hard.

　　沧县解放街青年团是怎样建立的？
    何子立
    沧县解放街，有四百零九户，多是工人及贫苦摊贩住家。有男女青年三百八十人，其中贫民占百分之八十以上。沧县城建团即确定这街为重点。
    去年十月，市青委干部到这街着手建团时，首先进行了调查，根据群众生活困难的要求，开始号召组织起来，发展生产。首先发现了积极分子脚行工人萧贵华，和小手工工人马大合等三人，以他们为骨干，进行广泛宣传教育和串通组织，并帮助他们组织了一个修理自行车的铺子，两个熬硝组，共十五个人搞起了生产。
    起初，有的对组织生产和建团有顾虑，市青委干部即抓紧召开会议，贯彻建团教育后，脚行工人萧贵华说：“早先有什么事轮着咱这脚行了哩？”有的说：“咱们穷小子们过去上不起学。”这时他们迫切要求学习文化，市青委干部就帮助他们组织了“工余学校”，白天生产，晚上就上课。大家学习情绪很高，二十几天中，由十五个人增到三十一个人，还吸收了十一个儿童。街上人们看他们学习的很好，送给他们一个电灯，一块黑板和粉笔等。市青委干部又领导着他们建立了黑板报、广播台和俱乐部。后来学员逐渐增到七十余人。
    通过学习，初步提高了阶级觉悟以后，市青委干部就诱导大家酝酿建国，在工余学校里讲了青年团课本，“团的性质与任务”，“为什么建国”，“入团的条件”等。并召开群众会、小组会，和进行个别培养教育，贯彻建团思想，到处开展了建团酝酿。这样经过半月以后，大部分积极青年对建团有了初步认识，只有少数人怕入了团耽误生产。针对这些思想情况，又继续贯彻教育，纠正错误认识。刘子义说：“入了团俺好好的干，各种工作干在头里。”接着开会讨论入团条件。有的说：“要生产积极的！”有的说：“要学习好的！”有的说：“在工作中起模范作用为人民服务的才能入团。”青年贫民尹保重说：“早先我穷的没人理，花钱剃头都没人给我剃，现在共产党领导俺翻了身，街上有事俺们能管了，俺要入团好好的干工作。”根据入团条件，首先批准了三个工人一个贫民入了团，并在青年群众大会上，宣布入了团的四个人。以后又以个别吸收的方式，发展了三个人入了团。
    举行入团仪式时，为了扩大影响，邀请了各街临时选派的青年代表与街干部来参加，市委也参加了。会上布置严肃隆重，七个团员都郑重宣誓自己今后努力方向与志愿，服从领导，遵守纪律等。当场并选出团支部。最后市委讲解了团的任务与组织生活，与群众关系等。礼拜寺街干部胡俊德，听讲以后说：“解放街建立了青年团，我回去俺街也要建立起来，希望别的街也建立起来。”
    贫农刘小黑好吃懒做，他也要求入团。团支部为了改造他，先替他借了一辆人推小车，帮助他推水菜做买卖，并一面抓紧对他进行教育，两个月的工夫，已逐渐转变成一个积极劳动的青年。
    青年团建立后，青年们工作很积极，结束土地改革看管浮财时，他们大冬天在房上睡觉不说冷，使物资一点也没受到损失。还帮助刘海、吴文祥等廿余青年组织了青菜挑、煎饼铺等。吴文祥等组织运输小组，也叫青年团去帮忙。工余学校坚持了按时上课，过去不识字的青年，有的在十几天中即能背写识字课本的前三课。春节中，他们组织秧歌队开展文娱宣传，并给军属扫院子、挑水、挂灯。但对团结广大青年群众还做的不够好，须要继续努力。
