Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, February 28th (via Telegraph Agency): The French Official Gazette declares that the French government has reached an agreement with the Vietnamese puppet "Emperor" Bảo Đại. It is believed here that this indicates Bảo Đại has agreed to return to Vietnam with the French government's false declaration of "recognizing" the country's unity and independence. A spokesperson for the Vietnamese press office in Europe commented today on the talks between Bảo Đại and French Prime Minister Queuille: "Regardless of what the managers of the Vietnamese banks or other groups decide to do with Bảo Đại, it will not change the final outcome of the struggle in Vietnam. Inspired by the sympathy and support of democratic forces around the world, the Vietnamese people will continue their heroic struggle until they achieve complete independence for Vietnam." Since June 1948, Bảo Đại had been refusing to return to Hanoi because he knows very well that at least 90 percent of the people of Nanjing, Annam, and Cochinchina support the Democratic Republic of Vietnam led by Hồ Chí Minh. A month ago, Washington suddenly exerted the strongest pressure on the French government to take vigorous steps to "clarify the situation in Vietnam," because the collapse of the Chinese Kuomintang government has made Vietnam, adjacent to China's southern provinces, a strategic pivot in the Far East. The southern provinces of China are what the United States plans to turn into a long-term stronghold "against Chinese Communism."

The situation in Vietnam is a major headache for French imperialism. After three years of war, with 120,000 French troops participating, the Viet Minh's political and military position is stronger than ever. As various French newspapers of different opinions have recently admitted, all the French government's experiments in establishing puppet regimes—of which there have been several—have been unsuccessful, with this latest one with Bảo Đại being the most unsuccessful. Bảo Đại was first a docile tool of the French, then of the Japanese, and was forced to abdicate at the end of the war.

　　越盟发言人发表谈话
    尽管美法把保大推上台去
    越南人民将继续胜利斗争
    【新华社陕北二十八日电】据电通社巴黎二十三日讯：法国官方公报宣称，法国政府与越南傀儡“皇帝”保大之间的谈判已获协议。此间认为，这表示保大已同意带着法国政府“承认”该国的统一与独立的虚伪宣告回到越南。越南驻欧洲的新闻处发言人今日评论保大与法国总理葛义的会谈称：“不管越南银行的经理们或其他集团决定和保大干些什么，都不会使越南的斗争的最后结果有什么改变。越南人民在全世界民主力量的同情与支持的鼓舞之下，将继续他们英勇的斗争，直到获到越南的完全独立为止。”自从一九四八年六月以来，保大一直拒绝返回河内，因为他知道得很清楚：南京、安南和交趾支那人民至少有百分之九十支持胡志明领导的越南民主共和国。一个月以前，华盛顿突然对法国政府施以最强大的压力，要它采取有力步骤以“澄清越南形势”，因为中国国民党政府的崩溃，已使毗邻中国南部省份的越南成为远东的战略枢要地点，华南各省是美国计划使之变成“反对中国共产主义”的长期据点的。
    越南的形势最使法帝国主义头痛。战争打了三年，参加作战的法军达十二万人，然而，越盟的政治和军事地位却较以往更加强大，象近来法国各种见解不同的报纸所承认的一样，法国政府建立傀儡政权的一切实验——已经有过几次——以与保大的这次最不成功。保大首先是法国的、后来又是日本的驯服工具，在战争结束时被迫逊位。
