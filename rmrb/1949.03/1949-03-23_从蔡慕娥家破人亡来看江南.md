　　Seeing Jiangnan Through the Ruin of Cai Mu'e's Family
　　Wu Mei

　　The winter before last, I was studying at Wuchang Second Women's High School. I had a classmate named Cai Mu'e. She and her mother lived together, and they made a living by doing some handwork. But she was the most diligent, always the first to arrive at school. One Tuesday, we were all surprised that Cai Mu'e didn't come. Was she sick? Just as we were talking about it, she rushed in, asking us for a pen and paper, tears welling up in her eyes. We quickly found her pen and paper, wondering why she would take a leave of absence. I was about to ask her when she grabbed me and ran outside. In the playground, she told me sadly: "What am I going to do? Yesterday, the army (referring to the Kuomintang bandit army) came to our house and said they wanted to live in it. I had to beg them, saying: 'We only have this one room, where will we live?' But they said: 'Military affairs come first now, everyone's house has to be lived in, no discussion.'" My mother was extremely worried, so she ran to my uncle. My uncle came and pleaded with them, saying it was really impossible. But those guys said: "Impossible or not, you have to make it possible, no discussion." Then they told the soldiers in the back to move things inside. My uncle got anxious and said, "Don't you have any sense of reason? Do you want to leave the common people with nothing to live on?" That officer immediately said, "Arrest him, he's a Communist, take him to headquarters." They tied up my uncle and took him away. My mother chased after them, but how could her bound feet catch up with them? Later, he never came back… When I got home from school, what did I see? Aunt Zhang next door told me. I was going to look for him, but Aunt Zhang said: "Don't go, your mother will come back, it's so dark, and the wind is so strong, a girl alone, just spend the night here with me." I was very upset and didn't dare to cry out loud, I didn't sleep all night, and as soon as it dawned, I went to look for my mother. As soon as I went out, a child selling sweet potatoes said to me: "Your mother is crazy! Last night, she was crying and laughing over there, running around, shouting to people: 'You ghosts! Want to eat people! You have guns, but I'm not afraid!' Ah! What am I going to do? Please ask for two days off for me, please." I didn't even have time to comfort her, and she had already run out the door. I watched her disappear in a hurry, remembering her sad expression… From then on, her miserable face often appeared in my mind… Later I went to Beiping, and once I received a letter from another classmate, who mentioned Cai Mu'e: Her mother was never found, it is said that she froze to death in a cave, and because she was helpless and homeless, she jumped into the Yangtze River!…"
　　Perhaps some people will not believe this, but this is indeed a factual record. In the Kuomintang-controlled areas of Jiangnan, how many families have been ruined by the bandit gangs!… The people of Jiangnan, living in deep water and scorching fire, are eagerly waiting for us to rescue them.

　　从蔡慕娥家破人亡来看江南
    五妹
    前年冬天，我在武昌第二女中读书。与我同班有一个叫蔡慕娥的同学，她家只有她和妈妈，两人生活就靠两人作些手工来维持。但她最用功，每天都是第一个到校，星期二，我们都很奇怪，蔡慕娥没有来，生病了？大家正谈论着的时候，她匆忙的跑来了，进了门就跟我们要笔和纸，眼里含着泪直要流下来，我们就赶快给他找笔纸，莫名其妙她怎么舍得请假呀？我刚想问问她，她却一把拉着我往外跑，到了操场上，她悲痛地和我说起来：“你看我怎么办呀？我们家昨天来了军队（指国民党匪军）说要住我们的房子，我只好哀求他们说：我们只有这一间房，你让我们住到那去？但是他们说：“现在军事第一，谁家的房子都得住，没话说。”我妈急得不得了，就跑去找我舅舅，我舅舅来了就苦苦的对他们说，这实在没办法。但是那些家伙说：“没办法也得有办法，没说的。”就叫后头的小兵往里搬东西，我舅舅一急就说“你们怎么一点理也不讲？你们还让老百姓活吗？”那个官立刻就说，“捉住他，他是共产党，带到总部去。”他们就绑上舅舅往外走，我妈就追，她那小脚，怎么能追上他们呢？后来就一直没回来……我放学回家一看，怎么啦？隔壁张大婶就跟我说了，我就要去找，张婶说：“你别去吧，你妈总会回来的，天这么黑了，风又很大，一个女孩子，就在我这过一夜吧。我难受得不得了，又不敢哭出声来，一夜没睡觉，等天一亮，就去找我妈。我刚出门，一个卖白薯的孩子就对我说：“你妈疯了！昨天晚上就在那边又哭又笑，东跑西跑，见了人就喊：‘你们这些鬼呀！想吃人呀！你们有枪我也不怕呀、’啊！你看我怎么好？请你替我请两天假，麻烦你。”我还没有来得及安慰她，她已经跑出大门了。我望着她那仓惶消失的背影，记忆着她那悲痛的神情……从此她那惨楚的面庞，时常呈现在我的脑子里…后来我到了北平，有一回接到另一个同学的信，说起蔡慕娥：她的妈妈始终没找到，据说冻死在山洞里，而她因无依无靠，无衣无宿跳了扬子江（长江）！……
    也许有人不会相信这事吧，但这确实是事实的记载。在国民党的统治区的江南，被匪帮害的家破人亡的岂止这一家！…生活在水深火热中的江南人民急盼我们去解救。
