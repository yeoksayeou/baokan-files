[Taiyue Electric] Qin Zihui, a worker at the public-operated Minyi Iron Furnace in Fushan, with unwavering dedication and ingenious problem-solving, overcame the issue of iron leakage in the iron pot molds, enabling the smooth development of the entire factory's production. In October of last year, Qin Zihui began working at the Minyi Iron Pot factory. At the time, due to the lack of good crucible clay, the made molds cracked and leaked molten iron when placed in the furnace. After seven or eight failed attempts, no pot was successfully cast, and some workers became discouraged. However, Qin Zihui refused to give up. He suggested to the manager: "Iron, coal, and crucible clay are the three treasures of the ironware industry, and Fushan has them all. The iron furnace can still be productive." He also encouraged the other workers and his apprentices to find ways to overcome the difficulties. After another failure, Qin Zihui remained persistent and continued to brainstorm, even while eating. He finally had the idea that the glaze used for firing vats must turn into a viscous liquid when heated, which might seal the cracks. He grabbed a handful and threw it into the model being fired. Sure enough, the mold stopped leaking. With this new method of his, even crucible clay that is susceptible to weathering can be used for molds. This has a significant impact on the manufacturing of production tools in parts of Fushan, Linfen, and Hongdong. Currently, the iron furnace has already cast more than 4,000 catties of finished products.

  　百折不回苦心想办法
    克服了锅模漏铁毛病
    【太岳电】浮山公营民益铁炉工人秦子辉百折不回，苦心研究想办法，克服了铁锅模型漏铁的毛病，使全厂生产得到顺利发展。去年十月，秦子辉到了民益铁锅上工作，当时因为没找到好坩泥，做下的模型装进火炉，并迸了缝子，把铁汁漏了。一连上了七、八炉货，也没铁成一个锅，有些工人灰了心，但秦子辉绝不灰心，向经理提出意见说：“铁、煤、坩泥，是铁器工业的三样宝贝，浮山都有，铁炉还是能干。”他又鼓励其他工人和他的徒弟们，要想办法来克服困难。经过又一次的失败后，秦子辉仍不灰心，继续想办法，甚至吃饭时候也在想。终于被他想到烧缸的釉子，在火里一定能化成一种黏液，或许可以糊住这些缝儿，想着就向正在烧的模型里，抓进了一把去，这一下，模型果然不漏了。有了他这一新办法，连不受风化作用的坩泥，也能做模型了。这对浮山、临汾、洪洞一部地区，在生产工具的制造上，有很大的作用，现该铁炉已铸出成货四千多斤。
