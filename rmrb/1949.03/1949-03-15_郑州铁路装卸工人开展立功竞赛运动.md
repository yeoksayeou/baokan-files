　　Zhengzhou Railway Loading and Unloading Workers Launch Labor Emulation Campaign
    [Xinhua News Agency, Central Plains, 14th] After the loading and unloading workers at the South Station of the Zhengzhou Longhai-Pinghan Railway launched a labor emulation campaign, their labor efficiency greatly improved. This labor emulation campaign began on February 15th and was initiated by the workers themselves. Since the beginning of the campaign, the labor efficiency of the workers has greatly improved. Coal loading workers at the Longhai Railway coal platform, in order to complete an urgent task, ten people loaded coal for five locomotives in six hours; before liberation, it would have taken at least fourteen people ten hours to load coal for five locomotives. One day, as the number of Longhai train services increased, ten workers on duty carried 60 tons of coal overnight, creating the highest record for coal loading workers at the coal platform since liberation. Ten coal platform workers on duty on the Pinghan line also continuously loaded 56 tons of coal and unloaded 45 tons of engine coal on February 25th, completing the task of loading and unloading 101 tons of coal in one day.

　　郑州铁路装卸工人开展立功竞赛运动
    【新华社中原十四日电】郑州陇（海）平（汉）铁路南站装卸工人开展立功竞赛运动后，劳动效率大大提高。此次立功竞赛运动于二月十五日开始，是工人们自动发起的。运动开始以来，工人们的劳动效率大大提高。陇海路煤台的搬煤工人，为完成紧急任务，十个人在六个钟头内装完五个车头的煤；解放以前，五车头的煤最少需十四个人装十个钟头。某日陇车班次增加，值班的十位工人一夜担煤六十余吨，创造了解放以来煤台工人装煤的最高纪录。平汉线十个值班煤台工人亦曾于二月二十五日连续装煤五十六吨，并卸机煤四十五吨，完成一天装卸一百零一吨煤的任务。
