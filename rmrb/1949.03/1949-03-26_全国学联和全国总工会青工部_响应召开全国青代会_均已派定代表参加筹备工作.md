Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 24th. The All-China Students' Federation and the Youth Workers Department of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions have sent telegrams to the All-China Liberated Areas Youth Federation, responding to the latter's proposal to convene a National Democratic Youth Congress. The two telegrams are as follows:

　　　　I. Telegram from the All-China Students' Federation to the All-China Liberated Areas Youth Federation
All-China Liberated Areas Youth Federation:
The All-China Students' Federation was officially established at the Fourteenth National Student Congress held from the 1st to the 6th of this month. The National Student Congress unanimously supports your proposal to convene a National Democratic Youth Congress this "May Fourth". We believe that convening this conference today, as the people's revolutionary war is approaching its final victory, is of great significance. As you pointed out in your announcement: "Currently, during this great period of transformation in Chinese history, our youth should inherit the glorious tradition of the 'May Fourth' Movement, strengthen unity, intensify efforts, and strive for the complete liberation of all Chinese people, and unite with all forces of the people nationwide to crush all sabotage conspiracies of American imperialism and the Kuomintang reactionaries, and to build a New Democratic New China." This is in line with the direction of the "Current Tasks of Chinese Students" decided by our Congress. We are determined to follow this policy, unite closely with the youth of the whole country, and intensify our efforts to welcome the convening of this Congress. The Executive Committee has decided to send Comrades Xie Bangding, Yan Fumin, Nie Yunhua, Liu Xiuzheng, and Shi Jitao to participate in the preparatory work for the National Democratic Youth Congress, and calls on students across the country to collect and study relevant materials and prepare to submit opinions and proposals to the Congress.

All-China Liberated Areas Youth Federation:
Upon receiving your notification of the proposal to convene a National Youth Congress, we believe that convening such a conference is absolutely necessary and timely, as the People's Liberation War is achieving great victories and Chinese history is entering a great period of transformation. On behalf of the nation's young workers, we warmly support this proposal and have decided to send Comrades Tong Xi, Wang Xuezeng, and Wang Rui to participate in the preparatory work. In order to welcome the convening of the Congress, we call on young workers across the country to work together with all employees to intensify production, support the Liberation War, and strive for the early realization of the genuine democratic peace proposed by Chairman Mao and representing the public opinion of the people of the whole country, based on the eight conditions.
