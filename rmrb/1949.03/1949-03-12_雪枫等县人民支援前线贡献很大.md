Xinhua News Agency, Central Plains, 5th. The people of Xuefeng, Xiao County, Mengcheng and other counties in the former Yu-Wan-Su Third District of the Central Plains Liberated Area, which suffered the most from the Chiang Kai-shek disaster, contributed enormous manpower, materials and financial resources to support the victorious operations of the Huaihai Campaign in order to avenge their hatred. According to incomplete statistics, in two months, the area contributed 61,378 stretchers, more than 134,700 carts, wagons and trailers, more than 1.6 million civilian laborers, more than 437,000 head of livestock (all of the above are calculated based on one trip), and requisitioned 155 million catties of grain (excluding rice bags and shipping costs). It also quickly repaired six highways centered on Xuefeng (formerly known as Yongcheng), namely Xue-Bo (County), Xue-Su (County), Xue-Xiao (County), Xue-Ning (Ning), Xue-Lin (Quan), and Xue-Wo (Wo), and erected more than 400 li of telephone lines, making communications and transportation in the war zone accessible in all directions. In the work of supporting the front lines, the people of the area created many heroic and exemplary deeds worthy of praise and tears. Around the New Year, heavy snow fell, and thousands upon thousands of civilian laborers carried and transported white flour on snowy and muddy roads to deliver it to the front lines in a timely manner. The Xue-Shang-Bo (newly established, parts of Xuefeng, Shangqiu, and Bo County) stretcher team alone, with more than 2,700 people, carried 370,000 catties of flour in eight days on a muddy and snowy journey of 50 to 90 li. More than 10,000 civilian laborers in Xia邑 County carried out a 130-li relay transportation, completing 400,000 catties in one day and night, so that the front supply station often maintained a grain reserve of 2 million catties. In the above work, a large number of activists emerged in the area, many of whom have been promoted to cadres, enriching the township and village governments and laying a solid foundation for continuing to support the front lines and mobilize the masses. In Xiao County, Xuefeng, and Xue-Shang-Bo alone, a total of more than 2,000 cadres and activists were promoted and trained.
