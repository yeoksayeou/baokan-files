Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 15th — Many reports indicate that American imperialism is actively plotting to annex China's territory, Taiwan Province. (1) According to an Agence France-Presse dispatch from Tokyo on the 1st of this month, MacArthur's headquarters recently issued a brazen statement, openly declaring: Taiwan still belongs to the Allied Headquarters (referring to the US occupation forces headquarters in Japan) before the signing of the peace treaty with Japan, and claiming: "Taiwan is currently only occupied by China." (2) According to a Central News Agency (Kuomintang) English dispatch from Tokyo on the 6th of this month, Chicago Tribune correspondent Cemen declared: Taiwan's economy will soon be "incorporated" into the Japanese economy under U.S. control. (3) The United States is also instigating so-called Taiwan "independence" to achieve its goals. An Associated Press dispatch from San Francisco on the 10th of this month revealed: "MacArthur is condoning the establishment of an independent Taiwan state by Chinese people." On the 28th of last month and the 1st of this month, MacArthur instructed the so-called Taiwanese groups controlled by American lackeys to issue calls for Taiwan's "independence" in Tokyo and Hong Kong. (4) On January 24, Hong Kong newspapers reported that when Chiang Kai-shek originally planned to go to Taiwan upon his "retirement," the United States deliberately used the excuse that "according to the Cairo Conference decision, Taiwan can only be considered Chinese territory after the signing of the peace treaty with Japan" to refuse his entry to Taiwan. On January 22, the day after Chiang Kai-shek announced his "retirement," the American imperialist Associated Press issued a dispatch from Taipei, releasing the suggestion: "If Chiang Kai-shek comes to Taiwan to escape Communist punishment and establish a government-in-exile, he will be working on a territory that does not formally belong to China." The aforementioned Hong Kong newspaper report pointed out: "This stance is meant to be shown to the Chinese Communist Party, so that in the event of total changes in South China and a Communist attack on Taiwan, the United States can use this prior statement to similarly refuse it." (5) At the same time, according to another Hong Kong newspaper report, MacArthur has dispatched representatives to Taiwan to engage in various military, political, economic, and espionage activities. In February, MacArthur secretly convened a meeting in Tokyo with Sun Liren, which is widely believed to be related to the U.S. plot to seize Taiwan.

　　美帝阴谋吞并台湾
  　积极进行各种罪恶活动
    【新华社陕北十五日电】许多消息显示美国帝国主义正积极图谋吞并中国的领土台湾省。（一）据法新社本月一日东京电，最近麦克阿瑟总部发表狂妄的声明，公然提出：在对日和约签订前台湾仍属于盟军总部（指美国对日占领军总部），并称：“台湾目前仅仅是由中国占领而已。”（二）据国民党中央社本月六日东京英文电，芝加哥论坛报驻东京记者塞门宣称：台湾的经济不久即将“并入”在美国管制下的日本经济中。（三）美国还在策动所谓台湾“独立”来达到目的。美联社本月十日自旧金山发出的电报透露：“麦克阿瑟纵容中国人建立台湾独立国的事情”。上月二十八日及本月一日麦克阿瑟已指使美国走狗控制下的所谓台人团体，在东京及香港发出要求台湾“独立”的叫嚣。（四）一月二十四日香港报纸曾载称：蒋介石“引退”时原来计划去台湾，当时美国即故意以“根据开罗会议决定，台湾须在对日和约签订后始能作为中国领土”为理由，拒绝他去台湾。一月二十二日，即蒋匪宣布“引退”的第二天，美国帝国主义的美联社自台北发出的电讯曾放出空气说：“如果蒋介石来台湾逃避共产党的惩罚，成立流亡政府，他将在一块尚未正式属于中国的领土上工作。”前引香港报纸消息指出：“这种姿态是装给中共看的，万一华南全部变动，中共进攻台湾，美国即可以这事先的声明，而同样加以拒绝。”（五）与此同时，据另一香港报纸报导，麦克阿瑟已派遣代表赴台湾从事军事的、政治的、经济的、特务的各种活动。二月间麦克阿瑟曾将孙立人接往东京秘密会议，众信亦与美国侵占台湾的阴谋有关。
