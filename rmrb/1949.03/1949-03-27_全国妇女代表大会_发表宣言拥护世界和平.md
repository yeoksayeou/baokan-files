　　National Women's Congress
  　Issues Declaration Endorsing World Peace
    [Report from this newspaper] The First National Congress of Chinese Women has issued a declaration responding to the "World Congress of Supporters of Peace." The full text is as follows:

    No one needs lasting peace more than we Chinese women. For hundreds of years, Chinese women have lived lives of slavery under the multiple oppressions of imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism. Historically, on countless occasions, imperialism has directly supported China's reactionary classes in launching civil wars, depriving hundreds of thousands of women and children of happiness and peace. We deeply remember these things, and we are determined to fight to the end to achieve true peace!

    The head of the international reactionaries – American imperialism – in order to save itself from its inextricable internal economic and political crisis, disregards the Soviet Union's repeated proposals for peaceful negotiations, actively carries out activities to establish the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, and strives to expand its scope, creating a new threat of war to the people of the world. However, since World War II, the forces of peace-loving people around the world, led by the Soviet Union, have grown and their strength is unprecedentedly powerful, enough to destroy all conspiracies for new wars. The victory of the Chinese People's Liberation War has further increased the strength and confidence in victory of the democratic peace forces in Asia and the world.

    The bastion of world democratic peace, the great Soviet state, is the savior of all oppressed nations in the world. The Soviet Union has always treated China with equal, fraternal friendship, assisting the Chinese people, and has always been our Chinese people's unwavering comrade-in-arms. Her declared unwavering policy of peace has been warmly supported by peace-loving people all over the world, and cries for peace have been heard from every corner of the world.

    The First National Congress of Chinese Women, on March 25th, is being held in the newly liberated Beiping. Among them are representatives from various liberated areas, as well as representatives of democratic women still under Kuomintang rule. We, 450 representatives, represent 235 million Chinese women, and everyone has a common goal. This goal is to further unite women across the country, exert greater strength, support the People's Liberation War, expose the false peace conspiracy of American imperialism and Chinese reactionaries, follow Chairman Mao Zedong's eight proposals, carry the revolution through to the end, and strive for victory throughout China. Because only in this way can China's independence and freedom and the true liberation of the people of the whole country be realized. And the complete elimination of the Kuomintang reactionaries and the expulsion of American imperialism from China is beneficial to the cause of world peace, and it is also an extremely heavy blow to the conspiracy of the new war provocateurs, defending world peace and democracy.

    In the past, our women, together with the entire Chinese people, defeated Japanese imperialism, and then engaged in fierce and fearless struggles against the Kuomintang reactionary rule supported by American imperialism. Now, the Chinese reactionaries fostered by American imperialism have been defeated, and national liberation is not far off. We will work even harder, under the inspiration of the beacon of Chinese people's liberation—the Chinese Communist Party, closely unite around the International Democratic Women's Federation, and fight tirelessly for China's independence and lasting world peace! We believe that in the face of a strong democratic peace front, the conspiracy of American imperialism to provoke a new war will surely be shattered, and true and lasting world peace will surely be realized. We vow:

    Resolutely support the World Congress of Supporters of Peace!
    Completely defeat the conspiracy of the instigators of new wars!
    Support the bastion of world democratic peace – the Soviet Union!
    Support Chairman Mao Zedong's eight peace conditions!
    Crush the false peace conspiracy of the Kuomintang reactionaries!
    Strive for lasting world peace!

　　全国妇女代表大会
  　发表宣言拥护世界和平
    【本报讯】中国妇女第一次全国代表大会，顷发表响应“世界拥护和平大会”宣言。全文如下：
    没有比我们中国妇女更需要永久的和平了。几百年来，我们中国妇女就在帝国主义、封建主义、和官僚资本主义的重重压迫下，过着奴隶的生活，历史上更不知有多少次，帝国主义直接扶持中国的反动阶级，进行内战，夺去了成千成万的妇女、儿童的幸福与和平，我们深深地记得这些，我们坚决要为实现真正和平而战斗到底！
    国际反动派的头子——美帝国主义，为了挽救其无法解脱的内部的经济与政治的危机，不顾苏联屡次和平谈判的建议，积极进行成立北大西洋公约的活动，并力谋扩大其范围，造成对全世界人民的新的战争威胁。但全世界爱好和平的力量在世界第二次大战以后，以苏联为首的世界民主阵营，日益增长，其力量已空前强大，足以摧毁一切新战争的阴谋，中国人民解放战争的胜利，更增加了亚洲以及全世界的民主和平的力量和胜利的信念。
    全世界民主和平的堡垒，伟大的苏联国家，是世界一切被压迫民族的救星，苏联对待我们中国，从来就以平等的兄弟的友谊，援助中国人民，始终是我们中国人民不渝的战友。她所宣示的坚定不移的和平政策，得到了全世界爱好和平人民的热烈拥护，从世界每个角落里，发出了和平的呼声。
    中国妇女第一次全国代表大会，三月二十五日，正在新解放的北平召开，其中有各解放区的代表，也有尚在国民党统治下的民主妇女代表，我们四百五十个代表，代表着二万万三千五百万的中国妇女，大家有着一个共同的目的。这个目的就是要进一步的团结全国妇女，发挥更大的力量，支援人民解放战争，揭穿美帝国主义和中国反动派的假和平阴谋，遵照毛泽东主席的八项主张，将革命进行到底，争取全中国范围的胜利。因为只有这样，才能实现中国的独立自由，和全国人民的真正解放。而国民党反动派之被彻底消灭，美帝国主义之被逐出中国，正是有利于世界和平事业，也就是极其沈重地打击了新的战争挑拨者的阴谋，保卫了世界和平与民主。
    过去，我们妇女和全中国人民一起，曾打败了日本帝国主义，接着又与美帝国主义支持下的国民党反动统治进行了剧烈的无畏的斗争，现在美帝国主义抚养下的中国反动派，已经被打垮，全国解放，为期不远。我们将愈益奋发努力，在中国人民解放的灯塔—中国共产党的感召下，紧紧团结在国际民主妇女联合会的周围，为争取中国的独立与世界的持久和平而作战不息！我们相信，在坚强的民主和平阵线面前，美帝国主义挑起新战争的阴谋，一定会被粉碎，全世界真正的持久和平，一定要实现。我们誓言：
    坚决拥护世界拥护和平大会！
    彻底打垮新战争的挑拨者的阴谋！
    拥护世界民主和平的堡垒——苏联！
    拥护毛泽东主席的八项和平条件！
    粉碎国民党反动派的假和平阴谋！
    为争取世界持久和平而奋斗！
