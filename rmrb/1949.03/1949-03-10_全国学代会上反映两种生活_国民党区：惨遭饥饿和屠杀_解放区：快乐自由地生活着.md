　　National Student Congress Reflects Two Kinds of Life
　　Kuomintang Areas: Suffering from Hunger and Slaughter
　　Liberated Areas: Living a Happy and Free Life
　　【Xinhua News Agency, Beiping, 4th】Xinhua News Agency reporter Alan. Weinington reports: At today's National Student Congress, student representatives from the Kuomintang-controlled areas reported to all delegates the cruel stories of hunger, slaughter, and lack of academic freedom. In contrast, student representatives from the liberated areas described their happy new life free from economic hardship and with academic freedom. The Kuomintang reactionaries' hope for universities is to create a group of technicians and intellectuals completely detached from the people, psychologically bound, and made into loyal lackeys of the ruling group, although their hope is often not realized. The Kuomintang has secret agents in every university and armed professional detectives disguised as students, who spy on students and faculty, beat, and even assassinate progressive students. At Shanghai Jinan University, armed "students" are led by a staff officer of the Shanghai Garrison Headquarters. Students there are often murdered by special agents in front of the director of the "Guidance Office," who himself is a Kuomintang agent. The vice president of this "institution of learning" once served as a supervisor in a concentration camp. A Beiping student told me that last year the Kuomintang arrested members of the Normal University Student Union and tied them up with ropes. He followed the bloodstains along the road for nearly a mile, where those young people had been brutally beaten with iron bars.
　　One representative said: At Shanghai Jiaotong University, more than 400 of the 2,400 students suffer from lung disease. Inflation has rendered their wages worthless, and the food allowance can only buy two small rolls a day. They lack clothing and bedding, and when eighty relief coats arrived, three hundred students requested to receive them. Many students have damaged their health due to lack of sleep because they work for low wages after class to make a living.
　　These situations, as well as the world-shocking Kuomintang's mass slaughter of students, have not frightened these young people, but often made them more determined to join the revolutionary camp.
　　In the liberated areas, the characteristic emphasized by every student is the connection between school and social life, the connection between theory and practice. For example, in the Northeast, students of agricultural colleges go to the countryside to help farmers and conduct experiments. No student is afraid of unemployment. Jobs are waiting for students—more jobs than people. Universities in the liberated areas are no longer universities serving a small number of privileged classes but universities serving the people. Illiteracy among the people is being eliminated, followed by the study of politics and culture. Today, many factories have training classes, and many villages have schools for young people and adults. Some students said that in the past, they studied for fame and fortune, but now this idea has been swept away, and the old selfish way of learning is gone. Now students help each other extensively in their studies in order to cultivate senior technicians as quickly as possible. For the same reason, students and teachers have become friends. Students and teachers criticize each other and improve their work, and as a result, many teachers have received genuine respect as never before. One student described an occasion when the students convened a "Respect Teachers Meeting," at which an old teacher who was particularly respected was moved to tears. He said: "For the rest of my life, I am truly doing the work I have always wanted to do—passing on my knowledge to those who are willing to learn." Exams are often conducted by the students themselves, without a teacher present. One female student said: "Why should we cheat? Who does cheating benefit? Cheating the people is our own loss, because we ourselves are the people."
　　The goals of the student union and the faculty are the same, so the student union helps the school, and the faculty also helps the student union. The student union often cares about students' welfare, entertainment, organizes visits to factories, and supports frontline work.
　　A Nanjing student representative sitting next to me had tears in his eyes when he heard about the fulfilling and happy lives of students in the liberated areas. When the meeting adjourned, he said, half to me and half to himself, "We will be liberated soon."

　　全国学代会上反映两种生活
    国民党区：惨遭饥饿和屠杀
    解放区：快乐自由地生活着
    【新华社北平四日电】新华社记者阿兰。魏宁顿报道：今天全国学生代表大会会上国民党统治区的学生代表向全体代表们报告了饥饿、屠杀和学术不自由的残酷故事。与这相对照的，解放区的学生代表描述了他们经济上困难的免除和学术自由的快乐新生活。国民党反动集团对于大学的希望就是要制造一批完全与人民脱离、心理上受着束缚而使他们成为统治集团忠实走狗的技术人员和知识分子阶层，虽然他们的这个希望常常不能实现。国民党在每一个大学里都派有秘密的特务和伪装成学生的武装职业侦探，他们刺探学生和教职员、殴打甚至暗杀进步学生。在上海暨南大学，武装的“学生”是受上海警备司令部一名参谋领导的。那儿的学生经常当着“训导处”长的面受到特务凶杀，那个“训导处”长本人就是一名国民党特务。这一所“学府”的副校长曾经当过集中营的督导员。一位北平学生告诉我，去年国民党逮捕了师范大学学生会的委员，用绳子把他们捆走。他曾经沿着路上的血迹，跟着走了近一哩地，那些青年们受了铁棒的凶殴。
    有一位代表说：在上海交通大学，二千四百名学生中有四百人以上患肺病。通货膨胀使他们的货金化归乌有，粮食津贴每天只能买两个小面卷。他们缺乏衣服和被褥，当八十件救济大衣到达时，竟有三百名学生要求领取。有许多学生因为睡眠不足而损坏了健康，原因是他们在下课后去作报酬很低的工作以维持生活。
    这些情形以及举世震恐的国民党大批屠杀学生的暴行并没有吓倒这些青年，反而经常使他们更坚决地参加了革命阵营。
    在解放区，每一个学生所强调指出的特点乃是学校和社会生活的联系，理论与实际的联系。例如在东北，农学院的学生到乡村里去帮助农民和进行实验。没有一个学生害怕失业。战业在等待着学生——职业比人多。解放区的大学已不再是为少数特权阶级服务而是为人民服务的大学了。人民中的文盲正被消灭着，识了字以后紧跟着就是学习政治和文化。今天很多的工厂都办了训练班，很多的村子都有青年和成年的学校。有些学生说，在过去，他们说书是为了功名利禄，现在这种念头已经扫除了，旧的自私自利的学习方式也没有了。现在学生们在学习中广泛地互相帮助，以便尽快地造就高级的技术人员。同样的理由使学生和教师成了朋友。学生和教师互相批评，改进工作，正因为如此，很多教师受到了前所未有的真正的尊敬。有一位学生描述有一次学生们召集了一个“尊师会”，会上有一位受到了特别尊崇的老教员感动得流泪了。他说：“在我的余生，我是真正做了我一向要做的工作——把我的知识传授给愿意学习的人。”考试经常由学生们自己来进行，不须有一个教员在场。一位女学生说：“我们为什么要作弊？作弊对谁有好处？欺骗人民是我们自己的损失，因为我们自己就是人民。”
    学生会和教职员的目标是同样的，所以学生会帮助学校，教职员也帮助学生会。学生会经常关心学生的福利，娱乐，组织参观工厂和支援前线的工作。
    坐在我旁边的一位南京学生代表听到解放区学生充实和快乐的生活时眼睛润湿了。会议休会时，他一半对着我，一半对他自己，说：“我们不久将会解放的”。
