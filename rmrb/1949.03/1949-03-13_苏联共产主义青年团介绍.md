Introduction to the All-Union Leninist Young Communist League

I

The All-Union Leninist Young Communist League was founded on October 29, 1918. In 1924, after Lenin's death, it was renamed to its current name in memory of Lenin.

At the beginning of its establishment, the Youth League had only 22,000 members. After the end of the Civil War, it expanded to 415,000 members. According to materials from the end of last year, there are currently more than 8 million members.

"The Youth League is a non-Party mass organization that unites the broad ranks of politically conscious working youth in urban and rural areas." (Charter of the Soviet Youth League) According to the 1940 statistics, the distribution of members at that time was as follows: Industry - 1.5 million, collective farms - 2.3 million, students - 2.5 million, young staff members - 1.6 million. Within the Youth League, there were 91,000 engineers and technicians, 342,000 teachers, 21,000 doctors, and 20,000 agronomists.

The main task of the Youth League, according to Stalin's instructions in 1925, is to educate young people in the spirit of Leninism and participate in the struggle for the victory of socialism.

The Youth League also leads the National Pioneer Organization (a youth organization for those under 14 years old), which currently has more than 10 million members.

From the day it was born, the Soviet Youth League participated in combat. During the Civil War of 1919-21, the Youth League mobilized its members three times during the three critical periods of the Soviet regime, directly participating in the armed struggle against imperialism and the White bandits. Therefore, it was awarded the Order of the Red Banner of Combat.

During the Soviet economic recovery period from 1921 to 1924, the Youth League worked closely with the Party to fight for the restoration of shattered industry and agriculture. At that time, the most difficult sector was the "fuel front." The Donbass coal mines, which were destroyed by the enemy, urgently needed to be repaired and increase production to meet national needs. The Party mobilized Youth League members to participate in this work. As a result of their tireless and selfless labor, coal production exceeded pre-war levels in less than a year.

During the two Five-Year Plans, Youth League members led all young people in creating amazing achievements on the labor and construction front. The "shock brigade" movement initiated by Leningrad Youth League members and the Stakhanov (Youth League member) movement initiated by Donbass coal miners quickly spread throughout the country and became the best form of socialist competition. In 1929, 7,000 Youth League members established the earliest and largest tractor factory in the Soviet Union - the Stalingrad Tractor Factory. Later, 200,000 Youth League members participated in the construction of Komsomolsk-on-Amur, Donbass coal mines, and other projects. They also built the Dnieper Hydroelectric Station, which was once the largest in Europe, and the Magnitogorsk and Kuznetsk metallurgical industrial bases, which are still the Soviet Union's heavy industry bases.

In June 1941, the German bandits invaded the Soviet Union, and the Great Patriotic War began. In the battles to defend Moscow, Leningrad, and Stalingrad, countless heroes emerged from the Youth League members. For example, in the battle to defend Sevastopol, Youth League member Balinkenko alone annihilated 309 German bandits. In the Battle of Stalingrad, Youth League member Sukhanov single-handedly resisted the attack of 30 tanks.

In the German-occupied areas, in Ukraine alone, there were 213 underground city and district committees and 268 Youth League underground organizations active during the war. In the Krasnodon region, the Youth League underground organization "Young Guard" was founded in 1942. They carried out propaganda in the occupied areas, sabotaged the German rear... Later, a large number of them were arrested, but they did not waver under enemy torture and calmly gave their lives for the cause.

Among the 10,942 Soviet combat heroes in the Soviet Union, 7,000 were Youth League members and youth.

In the rear, Youth League members put forward slogans such as "Everything for the front!" and "Fewer people, more work!" and actively engaged in production. They also organized many social activities, such as donating money to the Red Army, collecting military materials, technical learning, and adopting orphans.

The Youth League was awarded the Order of Lenin after the end of the war.

In completing the post-war new Five-Year Plan, Youth League members were active in the "savings," "cost reduction," and "creation of excess profits" movements.

In schools, the task of Youth League members is to strengthen scientific research and cultivate specialists, but they also organize a wide range of students to participate in various labor and social activities.

Now, under the slogan of "completing the Five-Year Plan in four years," Youth League members are constantly breaking records in various positions. The best production results have already completed the 1950 plan.

The overall role of the Youth League in the Soviet Union was praised by Comrade Stalin as "one of the belts connecting the Party and the working masses." In places where there are no Party organizations, the Youth League actually replaces the role of the Party.

III

Lenin and Stalin advocated the establishment of an independent youth political organization very early on. In the thirty years since the establishment of the Youth League, the All-Union Communist Party has nurtured and helped it like a favorite child.

The Party gave the Youth League many important guidance. In his report at the Third Congress of the Youth League in 1920, Lenin pointed out: "The task of the Youth League is to study," to study the construction of socialism; At one time, when many Youth League leaders were busy with economic construction work and neglected youth education work, Comrade Stalin pointed out: The Youth League should not copy the Party's methods, but should carry out communist education according to the characteristics of young people. In 1936, Comrade Stalin personally participated in revising the Youth League's charter.

When the Youth League made mistakes, the Party always patiently helped it to recognize and correct them like a loving father. In 1937, the Central Committee of the All-Union Communist Party sent Comrades Zhdanov, Kaganovich, and others to participate in the Standing Committee of the Central Committee of the Youth League to personally correct the bureaucratic tendencies of the Youth League leadership.

The Party always provides various conveniences for the work of the Youth League and helps the development of the work of the Youth League. For example, the Eleventh Congress of the All-Union Communist Party in 1922 specifically discussed the work of the Youth League, decided to strengthen the leadership of the Youth League, divide a part of the Party's strength to assist the work of the Youth League, and decided to find ways to expand the political education work of the Youth League, build youth clubs, schools, sports facilities, and publish youth publications.

The All-Union Communist Party highly valued the work of the Youth League. In the past thirty years, the Youth League has successively won the Order of the Red Banner of Combat, the Order of the Red Banner of Labor, and the Order of Lenin. Comrade Stalin said: "The Youth League is always standing in the forefront of our fighters." When Comrade Kalinin talked about the achievements of Youth League members in the Great Patriotic War, he said: "These people have shown political perfection, organizational experience and combat art, and showed lofty patriotism and infinite loyalty to the Soviet people. They have shown the world the high morality of the Soviet people. Everyone will understand how rich the fruits of Comrade Stalin's constant care for the Youth League and youth have brought!"

　　苏联共产主义青年团介绍
    一
    苏联列宁共产主义青年团于一九一八年十月二十九日成立，一九二四年列宁逝世后，为纪念列宁，才改称现名。
    青年团在开始成立时，仅有团员两万二千人。内战结束后，扩大到四十一万五千人，根据去年年底材料，现有团员八百余万人。
    “青年团是非党的群众组织，在其队伍中团结了城乡先进的有政治认识的劳动青年之广大阶层”（苏联青年团团章）根据一九四○年的统计，当时团员分布情况如下：工业——一百五十万人，集体农庄——二百三十万人，学生——二百五十万人，青年职员——一百六十万人，在青年团中有九万一千名工程师、技师，三十四万二千名教师，二万一千名医生，二万名农学家。
    青年团的主要任务，依照斯大林在一九二五年的指示，是以列宁主义的精神教育青年，参加争取社会主义胜利的斗争。
    青年团还领导全国少年先锋队（十四岁以下的少年组织），现在共有队员一千余万人。
    二
    从诞生那天开始，苏联青年团就参加了战斗。在一九一九——二一的内战中，青年团曾在苏维埃政权危急的三个时期，三次总动员自己的团员，直接参加反帝国主义、反白匪的武装斗争。因此而膺得战斗红旗勋章。
    在一九二一——二四年苏联经济恢复时期，青年团与党密切团结在一起，为恢复破碎的工业和农业而斗争。当时最困难的部门是“燃料战线”。被敌人破坏的顿巴斯煤矿，亟待修复和提高产量，以供应全国需要。党动员青年团员参加了这项工作。他们忍饥挨饿不眠不息的劳动结果，不出一年，煤的产量就超过了战前的水平。
    在两次五年计划中间，青年团员带领全体青年在劳动建设战线上创立了惊人的功绩。由列宁格勒青年团员发起组织的“突击队”运动和顿巴斯煤矿工人发起的斯塔哈诺夫（青年团员）运动，迅速普及全国，成为社会主义竞赛的最好的形式。一九二九年，七千青年团员建立了苏联最早和最大的拖拉机工厂——斯大林格勒拖拉机厂，后来又有二十万青年团员参加了康姆索莫尔城，顿巴斯煤矿等建设。他们还建设了曾是欧洲第一的德聂伯水电站，建设了到现在为止还是苏联重工业基地的马格尼托戈尔和库兹涅茨两大金属工业基地。
    一九四一年六月，德寇侵犯苏联，伟大卫国战争开始了。在保卫莫斯科、列宁格勒、斯大林格勒的战斗中，青年团员中英雄层出不穷。例如在保卫塞巴斯托波尔的战斗中，青年团员巴力兼柯一人消灭了三百零九名德寇。在斯大林格勒保卫战中，青年团员苏哈诺夫一人抵挡了三十辆坦克的进攻。
    在德寇占领区，仅在乌克兰一地，战时就有二百十三个地下市委和区委与二百六十八个青年团地下组织在活动。在克拉斯诺顿地区，一九四二年创立了青年团地下组织“青年近卫军”，他们在敌占区进行宣传，破坏德寇后方……后来其中有一大批人被捕，但他们在敌人酷刑之下毫未动摇，从容就义。
    在苏联全国一○九四二名苏联战斗英雄中有七千名是青年团员和青年。
    在后方，青年团员提出“一切为了前线！”“人少工不少！”等口号，积极生产。他们还组织许多社会活动，如为红军捐款，收集军事物资，技术学习，收养孤儿等工作。
    青年团在战争结束后又膺得了列宁勋章。
    在完成战后新五年计划中，青年团员是“节约”、“减低成本”、“创造超额利润”等运动的积极分子。
    在学校中，青年团员的任务是加强科学研究，培养专门家，但同时也组织广大学生参加各种劳动和社会活动。
    现在，在“四年完成五年计划”的口号下面，青年团员在各种岗位上不断打破纪录。生产成绩最好的已有完成一九五○年计划的了。
    青年团在苏联所起的总的作用，曾被斯大林同志誉为“联结党与劳动群众的引带之一”。在没有党的组织的地方，青年团实际上代替了党的作用。
    三
    列宁和斯大林很早就主张成立一个独立的青年政治组织。在青年团成立以后的三十年间，联共党一直如爱护自己的宠儿一样扶植它，帮助它。
    党给与青年团许多重要的指导，一九二○年列宁在青年团第三次代表大会上的报告中，指出：“青年团的任务就是学习”，学习建设社会主义；有一个时期，当许多青年团的负责人忙于经济建设工作，忽略了青年教育工作时，斯大林同志指出：青年团不应抄袭党的一套，应根据青年特点，进行共产主义教育。一九三六年斯大林同志曾亲自参加修改青年团的团章。
    当青年团犯了错误时，党总是象慈父一样耐心的帮助它去认识错误，纠正错误。一九三七年，联共中央曾派日丹诺夫、卡冈诺维奇等同志参加青年团中央常委会，亲自纠正青年团领导机构的官僚主义倾向。
    党对青年团的工作总是给以各种方便，帮助青年团工作的发展。例如一九二二年联共党第十一次代表大会曾专门讨论了青年团工作问题，决定加强青年团的领导，分出一部党的力量协助团的工作，并决定设法扩展青年团的政治教育工作，建设青年俱乐部、学校、体育设施和出版青年刊物等。
    联共党对青年团工作的评价很高。在过去三十年间，青年团曾先后膺得了战斗红旗勋章劳动红旗勋章和列宁勋章。斯大林同志说过：“青年团永远是站在我们战士队伍的最先列。”加里宁同志当讲到青年团员在卫国战争中的功绩时说过：“这些人表现了政治上的炉火纯青，组织经验与斗争艺术，表现了崇高的爱国主义和对苏联人民的无限忠诚，他们对全世界显示了苏维埃人的高度道德，每个人都会懂得，斯大林同志对青年团和青年的不断关怀已经带来了多么丰富的果实！”
