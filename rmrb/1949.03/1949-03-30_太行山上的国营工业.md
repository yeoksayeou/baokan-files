The existing state-owned industries in the Taihang area, under the correct leadership of the Party for several years, and with the broad masses of workers giving play to their enthusiasm and creativity with a sense of ownership, have been able to overcome the difficulties of lacking raw materials, technology, and machinery under the heavy blockade of the Japanese and Chiang bandits. As a result, industries destroyed by the Japanese and Chiang bandits have been restored and developed, and new national industries have been built. There are relatively modern industries such as munitions, coal mining, machine manufacturing, textile, paper making, pharmaceuticals, tobacco, and printing, playing a leading role in the entire industry and handicraft industry of Taihang, and playing a significant role in supporting the national people's liberation war and improving the lives of the people in Taihang. The main parts of the state-owned industry are briefly introduced as follows:

		I. Coal Industry

Managed by the Enterprise Department of the North China Government, the main ones are the Fengfeng (Fengfeng Coal Industry Company) and Shigie (Baijin Coal Industry Company) mining areas. Fengfeng was liberated in September 1945. The coal mine was occupied by the Japanese invaders during the War of Resistance Against Japan. At that time, there were eight mine pits with more than 9,200 workers. Thanks to the active protection of the workers' underground army, the machinery and equipment were not destroyed at the time of liberation and became the property of the people. Before liberation, most of the workers were "coolies" conscripted by the enemy and puppet regime, and the workers could not even get enough to eat all day long, so the output was extremely low. The highest daily output was no more than 1,500 tons. Although many workers returned home after liberation, the workers who remained in the mine were guaranteed a living and were freed from the terror rule of the enemy and puppet regime, and their enthusiasm for production was greatly enhanced. In order to resume production as soon as possible, the workers automatically repaired the old 500-kilowatt generator that had been shut down for three years. During the repair, workers Ji Zhengxiang and technician Wang Liancheng stayed up for several nights to actively design the repairs. The output also increased rapidly. In the Red May production competition in 1946, Tongshun, Taian, and Shuanghe mines produced 30,000 tons of coal. The average daily output per person reached 0.63 tons, which was more than double the 0.3 tons in the enemy and puppet era. There are currently 2,500 workers and 200 staff members. Coal is being produced from Taian, Tongshun, Nandayu, and Dongda mine pits. Together with its affiliated Wu'an Hecun and Guo'erzhuang mines, the daily output of coal is 1,400 tons. Since the first factory of the mine abolished the historical contracting system in the spring of 1948 and adopted a reasonable piece-rate wage system, the output has increased by 37% compared with before the reform, and the cost has been reduced by 30%.

The Baijin Coal Industry Company includes the Shigie Coal Mine. The Shigie Coal Mine alone has been developing and growing steadily for four years since its liberation on August 18, 1945, thanks to the efforts of all employees. Before liberation, there were more than 300 employees, with an average daily output of 0.26 tons of coal per person. Now the number of workers has increased to more than 600. In December 1948, the daily output reached 470 tons. The average daily output of coal per worker is 0.78 tons, more than one and a half times higher than during the enemy and puppet rule.

The Jiaozuo mining area in northern Henan (temporarily under the management of Taihang) and the Anyang Xinzhuang (including Duli Mine), Shahe Zhangcun, Neiqiu Shaoming, Lincheng Qicun, and Changzhi Jiazhang small machine mines are operated by Taihang Industrial Company. The Jiaozuo mining area was severely damaged by the Japanese puppets when it was liberated in the autumn of 1945, but production was quickly restored after the workers actively repaired it. By April 1946, the number of workers had increased to more than 1,200, with a daily output of more than 900 tons of coal. The workers overcame many difficulties during the restoration. For example, the past method of mining with electric drills has been replaced by the method of mining with steel chisels and brown explosives. The repair workers used a high degree of research spirit to repair the irreparable 6-inch electric shaft by using a hot baking device. In October 1946, it was occupied by Chiang bandits. During the second liberation in October 1948, the workers actively protected the mining area and organized in advance to prevent the destruction and dismantling by the Chiang bandits, so that the machines were intact. The east and west major wells in the Lifeng area resumed production on the day of liberation, and the power plant immediately sent water and electricity. The workers also voluntarily contributed machine parts with a preservation value of 20,000 yuan (RMB). By mid-November, there were more than 960 workers with a daily output of 800 tons, and the average daily output of coal per person was 0.83 tons, more than twice the 0.23 tons per person per day under the rule of Chiang bandits (at that time, there were more than 300 workers with a daily output of 60-70 tons). It has now increased to 1,200 tons. When the Industrial Company took over the remaining five mines, including Xinzhuang and Zhangcun, some were destroyed by the Japanese invaders, and some were poorly equipped with very low production. Later, with the active construction of the Industrial Company and its employees, production has significantly improved. There are currently 2,454 workers, and a total of more than 164,200 tons of coal were produced in the past 10 months, more than double the 74,800 tons in 1947.

		II. Machine Manufacturing Industry

In terms of machine manufacturing, in addition to the well-equipped repair and manufacturing plants in various state-owned factories, the Huafeng Machine Factory, affiliated with the Industrial Company, is the only factory that manufactures machine parts and equipment for Taihang industry. The factory developed from a small tool factory during the War of Resistance Against Japan. It can now manufacture complex machine tools such as lathes and planers. In 1948, with the efforts of more than 280 employees, using dozens of machine tools made by themselves, more than 100 large machines such as lathes, planers, washing machines, steam hammers, gas engine, water pumps, and steam engines were manufactured. This not only strengthened the Huafeng factory itself, but also solved the machine difficulties in Taihang textile, printing, paper making, coal mining, and other industries. In particular, the successful manufacturing of the 15-horsepower gas engine has added many conveniences to the development of small-scale industries. The successful creation of sterilizers and surgical instruments has also solved the urgent difficulties in current medical treatment.

		III. Iron Smelting Industry

In terms of iron smelting, there is the Huaxing Iron Smelting Plant affiliated with Taihang Industrial Company. The Taihang iron smelting industry was extremely underdeveloped in the past, especially gray pig iron, which had become a major difficulty for industrial raw materials for a period of time. Later, it was discovered that the plow-faced furnace in the Taiyue area produced gray pig iron, and the Industrial Company sent people to study and learn. After half a year, the Huaxing Iron Smelting Plant was established. The output and quality gradually increased. Now, it can produce 250 kilograms of gray iron at a time, and the first-class gray iron has increased to more than 90%. The successful trial of this iron smelting method was promoted to all factories in Taihang that use gray iron, which not only solved the needs of raw materials in the area, but also exported a part to the Bohai Military Region.

		IV. Textile Industry and Chemical Industry

The Yihua Yarn Factory (with weaving factory) in Wu'an and the Wu'an Chemical Factory (with oil press factory) are operated by Taihang Industrial Company. The Yihua Yarn Factory started construction in October 1947. There are currently 10 spinning machines (400 spindles per machine), 406 employees (including 16 female workers). Except for one machine that is frequently cleaned, it produces 5,000 bundles of 20-count yarn per month. After the implementation of democratic management and level-by-level responsibility system last November, the workers truly realized their status as masters and automatically launched a production increase competition. The daily output per spindle increased from 0.81 pounds to 0.92 pounds, an increase of 11% compared to the highest output of 0.82 pounds during the Japanese and puppet management. The production plan for this spring is to complete 628,000 pounds of yarn and 5,600 bolts of foreign cloth. In order to increase the output of cloth, "Toyota" automatic looms are being installed. The chemical factory is also under construction. In addition to one oil press that produces more than 3,000 catties of oil per day, there are also facilities for making soap, extracting coal, and gasoline.

		V. Other Industries

Other major industries include Taihang Paper Mill, Lihua Pharmaceutical Factory, Xinhua Tobacco Company, and Xinhua Printing Factory. These industries have gradually developed in the difficult environment of the War of Resistance Against Japan. Since the Taihang Paper Mill adopted the grinding machine and steaming pot made by the Huafeng Machine Factory, and used hydropower generation, it has gradually transitioned from handicraft production to machine production. Now, the factory can not only manufacture general civilian paper, but also can manufacture bond paper, banknote paper, double-sided printing paper, single-sided printing paper, and thick cardboard, which greatly supplies the needs of the printing industry. The Lihua Pharmaceutical Factory can now manufacture more than 120 kinds of scientific medicines, some of which can be comparable to Western medicines. The various injectable solutions produced, such as Comfort Naxin, ephedrine, calcium chloride, and glucose, from bottles to medicines, are all self-made, and their effectiveness is very good. Many hospitals in this area use products from the factory, especially during the War of Resistance Against Japan, it has greatly supplied military and civilian needs and overcome the difficulties of medicines. The Xinhua Tobacco Company currently has 263 internal workers, 100-200 external workers, and 25 staff members. There are 13 cigarette machines, currently operating 10 machines. Every day (two shifts, 19 hours in total) produce more than 2,500 packs (25 boxes per pack, 20 cigarettes per box). There are three large scraping machines and four small ones, and two compressing machines. The "Battleship" brand cigarettes produced are very good and are sold in this area and in Jinzhong and southern Hebei.

The construction of these industries has changed the face of the desolate Taihang Mountains. (Taihang Electric)

　　太行山上的国营工业
    太行区现有的国营工业，数年来，在党的正确指导下，广大职工以主人翁的态度发挥了积极性与创造性，因此，能够在日本、蒋匪的重重封锁下战胜缺乏原料、技术、机器的困难，使被日寇、蒋匪破坏了的工业得以恢复与发展，并且建设了新的国家工业。有较近代化的军火、采煤、机器制造、纺织、造纸、制药、烟草、印刷等工业，在太行的整个工业手工业中起着带头的作用，对支援全国人民解放战争及对太行人民生活的改善起了重大的作用。现将国营工业中主要的部分简略介绍如下：
    　　　　一、煤业
    属华北政府企业部经营的，主要的有峰峰（峰峰煤业公司）石圪节（白晋煤业公司）等矿区。峰峰于一九四五年九月解放。该煤矿在抗战中被日寇侵占，当时共有矿坑八个，里外工人九千二百余。机器设备解放时在工人地下军的积极保护下，未遭破坏，变成人民的财产了。解放前大部工人系敌伪强征而来的“苦力”，工人劳动终日不得一饱，所以产量极低，最高时日产也不过一千五百吨。解放后虽有不少工人返家，但留矿的工人由于生活上得到了保证，解除了敌伪时代的恐怖统治，生产积极性大为增强，工人们为了提早恢复生产，曾自动的修好了停工三年的五百基罗瓦特的旧破发电机。在修理中工人纪征祥及技师王连成等都曾数夜未睡，积极设计。产量也很快提高，在一九四六年红五月生产竞赛中通顺、太安、双和三并共产煤三万吨，每人每日平均产量已达点六三吨，超过敌伪时代点三吨的一倍。现共有工人二千五百，职员二百人。太安、通顺、南大峪、东大矿坑均已出煤，连其所属武安和村，郭二庄两矿共日产煤一千四百吨。该矿第一厂自一九四八年春季废除了历史上的包工制，改用合理的按件计资后，产量较改革前又提高了百分之三十七，成本减低百分之三十。
    白晋煤业公司所属有石圪节煤矿等。仅石圪节煤矿自一九四五年八月十八日解放后，四年来在全体职工的努力建设下，一直发展壮大。解放前共有职工三百余，每日每人平均产煤为点二六吨。现工人已增至六百余人，一九四八年十二月份每日产量已达四百七十吨。每工每日平均产煤点七八吨，超过敌伪统治时的一倍半多。
    属于太行实业公司经营的有豫北焦作矿区（暂为太行代管）及安阳辛庄（包括都里矿）、沙河章村、内邱邵明、临城祁村、长治贾掌等小型机器矿。焦作矿区于一九四五年秋季解放时，遭到日伪严重破坏，但经工人积极抢修很快恢复了生产。至一九四六年四月间工人已增至一千二百余，日产煤九百余吨，在恢复中工人是克服了很多困难的，如过去以电钻开采，现在则以钢凿及褐色炸药的开采方法所代替，修理工则以高度的研究精神将无法修复的直径六英寸电轴以热烘装置法修好，一九四六年十月，又被蒋匪侵占，一九四八年十月二次解放时，工人们为积极保护矿区，即事前组织起来阻止了蒋匪的破坏与拆运，使机器完好无损。李封区东西两大井于解放当日即恢复生产，发电厂自来水马上送水送电。工人又自动献出了保存价值二万元（人民币）的机器零件。至十一月中旬，共有工人九百六十余人，日产八百吨，每日每人平均产煤点八三吨，超过蒋匪统治时每人每日产点二三吨的二倍多（当时共有三百余工人日产六、七十吨）。现已增至一千二百吨。其余辛庄、章村等五矿当实业公司接办时，有的遭到日寇破坏，有的设备很不完善，产量极低，后经实业公司与职工的积极建设，产量已有显著提高。现共有工人二千四百五十四人，去年十个月计共出煤十六万四千二百余吨。较一九四七年七万四千八百吨增加一倍多。
    　　　　二、机器制造业
    在机器制造业方面，除了各国营工厂均设有完善的修制厂外，单独制造机件装备太行工业的有实业公司所属华丰机器厂。该厂是从抗日战争中一个小型工具厂发展起来的。现可以制造元车、刨床等复杂的工作机。一九四八年在二百八十余职工的努力下，用自己亲手制出的数十部工作母机又造出了元车、刨床、洗床、汽锤、煤器发动机、水泵、蒸气机等大器机器一百余部，不但壮大了华丰本厂，也解决了太行纺织、印刷、造纸、采煤等工业中一部分机器的困难。特别是十五马力的煤气发动机的制造成功，对发展小型工业上增加了许多便利条件。消毒器与手术工具的创造成功，又解决了当前医药治疗上的迫切困难。
    　　　　三、炼铁业
    在炼铁方面，有太行实业公司所属的华兴炼铁厂。太行炼铁事业，过去极不发达，特别是灰生铁曾有一个时期成了工业原料的极大困难。后来发现太岳区犁面炉是灰生铁，始由实业公司派人前往研究学习。经半年时间，成立了华兴炼铁厂，正在设炉，产量及质量逐渐提高，现一次可出灰铁二百五十斤，头等灰铁已增至百分之九十以上。这一炼铁办法试验成功，推广到太行所有用灰铁的工厂中，不但解决了本区的原料需要，曾向渤海军区输出一部。
    　　　　四、纺织业与化学工业
    在太行实业公司经营下的有武安的益华纱厂（附织布厂）、武安化学厂（附榨油厂）。益华纱厂于一九四七年十月动工建筑。现有十部细纱机（每部纱锭四百枚），职工四百零六人（内女工共十六名），除一部经常擦洗外，每月产二十支纱五千捆。去年十一月实行了民主管理和逐级负责制后，使工人真正体会了主人翁的地位，自动展开了增产竞赛，每锭每日产量由零点八一磅增至零点九二磅，较日伪经营时最高产量零点八二磅增加了百分之十一。今年春季的生产计划要完成六十二万八千磅纱，五千六百匹洋布。为增加布的产量，现正按装“丰田”式自动织布机。化学厂也正在建设中，除一部榨油机每日出油三千余斤外，其余尚有制肥皂、提炼煤、汽油等。
    　　　　五、其他工业
    其他主要工业有太行造纸厂、利华制药厂、新华烟草公司、新华印刷厂等。这些工业都是在抗日战争的艰苦环境中逐渐发展起来的。太行造纸厂自采用华丰机器厂所制的碾料机与蒸料锅，并利用水力发电后已逐渐由手工业生产过渡到机器生产。现该厂不但可制造一般民用纸，而且已能制造磅纸、钞票纸、双印、单印、厚板等纸，大量供给了印刷事业的需要。利华制药厂现可制造各种科学药一百二十余种，有的可与西药相媲美。所产的康福纳心、麻黄素、盐化钙、葡萄糖等各种注射液从瓶到药水皆为自制，其效力甚佳。本区不少医院是使用该厂出品，特别是在抗日战争中曾大量供给了军需民用，克服了药品的困难。新华烟草公司现有里工二百六十三人，外工一百至二百人，职员二十五人。卷烟机十三部，现开动十部，每日（两班共十九小时）共产二千五百余条（每条二十五盒每盒二十支），大型刮烟机三部，小型四部，压稀机两部。所产“战舰”牌香烟甚为优良，行销于本区与晋中、冀南各地。
    由于这些工业的建设，已使荒凉的太行山改变了面目。（太行电）
