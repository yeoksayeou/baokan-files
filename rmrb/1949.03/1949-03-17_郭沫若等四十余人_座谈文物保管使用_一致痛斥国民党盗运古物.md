　　(Our Newspaper) The Beiping Military Control Commission's Cultural Takeover Committee held a forum for people in cultural circles at the Beijing Hotel yesterday (the 16th) at 1:30 PM. Those present included Guo Moruo, Mao Dun, Jian Bozan, Tian Han, Chu Tunan, Hou Wailu, Fu Dingyi, Zhang Xiruo, Ge Baoquan, Ma Heng, Wang Chongmin, Liang Sicheng, Xiang Da, Tang Lan, Deng Yizhe, Pan Guangdan, Han Shouxuan, Weng Dujian, Lu Yudao, Huang Wenbi, Xu Guangping, Li Dequan, Qian Jiaju, Yu Li, Chao Zhefu, Wu Han, Qian Junrui, Yin Da, Wang Yechiu and more than forty others. First, the chairman Qian Junrui and the head of the Cultural Relics Department of the Cultural Management Committee, Yin Da, gave a brief report on the situation of the various units that the Cultural Relics Department had taken over, explaining that the purpose of convening this forum was to solicit suggestions from everyone on how to improve the People's Beiping Library and the Palace Museum. The meeting proceeded in a free and pleasant atmosphere, and those present unanimously expressed their indignation at the Kuomintang bandit gang's theft and transportation of the people's cultural relics. Deng Yizhe, a professor at Tsinghua University, proposed that cultural figures in Beiping should lodge a serious protest against the Kuomintang bandit gang's theft and transportation of antiquities, issue a letter of protest, investigate responsibility for damaging antiquities, and make every effort to recover the cultural relics transported to the United States. This proposal was unanimously passed by the audience. Guo Moruo, Ma Heng, and Wang Chongmin were designated to draft the letter of protest, to be completed within three days. Jian Bozan pointed out: Today, cultural relics have been transferred from the scholar-official class to the people. We must pay attention to popularization, and we must do popularization work. Finally, he also put forward the proposal to "prohibit the export of cultural relics." Chu Tunan said that we should provide suggestions to the People's Government to formally establish a specialized management agency for books and cultural relics, and to give full play to the effectiveness of cultural relics in culture. Tian Han said: The Palace Museum should not only be a place for experts to conduct research, but more importantly, it should enable the people to see historical facts from everything in the Palace Museum, and to give the people an education against feudalism and imperialism. Guo Moruo said that the battle we are currently engaged in is partly military and partly ideological. It is of great significance to be able to discuss this issue while the war is going on. We will destroy the counter-revolutionary forces militarily, and judging from the current situation, we will soon achieve the final victory, but destroying the counter-revolutionary forces culturally and ideologically will require long-term efforts. I hope that our cultural workers will redouble their efforts to achieve a great victory in culture and ideology. Finally, Qian Junrui gave a brief concluding speech, in which he expressed his hope that all cultural, educational, and academic people would work together to achieve a combination of cultural and military victories. He said: The cultural relics department, like other academic departments, belongs to the people, and therefore it should become a research institution that serves the interests of the people, to achieve a state of "owned by everyone, and run by everyone." The forum did not end until 6:30 PM.
