(Hebei East Telegram) The first widespread spring rain has fallen in various parts of the Hebei East region. From the night of the 23rd of last month to the evening of the 25th, there was a continuous drizzle, with drops soaking into the ground, penetrating about one to two "shi cun" (Chinese inches) into the soil. The entire region had little rain last autumn and no heavy snow in winter, making the soil dry, and planting spring wheat in higher areas was difficult. This rain was timely. In lower-lying areas such as Yutian and Baodi, it connected with the moisture rising from below (springtime soil moisture rising from below), and the soil is now moist, suitable for planting spring wheat. In mountainous areas such as Pinggu and Qian'an, the soil is also softer, suitable for spring plowing and rolling. Farmers everywhere are beaming with joy. After the rain, they are busy going to the fields to plant spring wheat and preparing to tidy up the land, saying, "Spring rain is as precious as oil. If there are a few more rains like this, the harvest this year will certainly be good."

　　冀东各地喜雨
  　农民赶种春麦
    【冀东电】冀东各地第一次普降春雨。自上月二十三日夜起到二十五日傍晚，细雨绵绵，点点入地，透地约一市寸至二市寸余。全区去秋少雨，冬季又无大雪，土壤干燥，较高地区播种春麦很感困难。这场雨下的及时，玉田、宝坻等较洼下地带，均与反浆（春季地里自下向上潮湿，反浆）湿土相接上，土质润湿，宜于播种春麦；平谷、迁安等山地土亦较软，宜于春垡地、轧地。各地农民都喜形于色，雨后，忙着下地种春麦及做收拾地的准备，都说：“春雨贵如油。这雨多下几场，今年收成一定错不了。”
