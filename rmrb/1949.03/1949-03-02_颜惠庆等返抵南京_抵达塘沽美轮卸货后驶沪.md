Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 28th. Yan Huiqing, Shao Lizi, Zhang Shizhao, and Jiang Yong, who came to Beiping on the 14th of this month in a private capacity to discuss peace issues, returned to Nanjing from Beiping on the 27th. According to a Nanjing dispatch from the Kuomintang Central News Agency on the 27th, the four released a written statement after disembarking, the full text of which is as follows:

　　We, acting in a private capacity, visited Beiping for two weeks, during which we repeatedly held joint or separate discussions with CCP leaders Ye Jianying, Lin Biao, Nie Rongzhen, Dong Biwu, Luo Ronghuan, and Bo Yibo. We were also invited to Shijiazhuang for a visit, where we were received by CCP Chairman Mao Zedong and General Zhou Enlai, and broadly exchanged views on the issue of peace negotiations. We deeply feel that although there are still many difficulties in the prospect of peace talks, there is great hope. Our mission is nearing completion, so we are returning south to report to Acting President Li and then return to Shanghai. During our time in Beiping and Shijiazhuang, we reached agreement in principle on issues such as facilitating navigation and postal services for the people of the North and South. We are also grateful for the sincere hospitality of the CCP leaders.

　　Yan Huiqing, Jiang Yong, Zhang Shizhao, Shao Lizi (signed)
