　　Tianjin Electric. Over fifty technical personnel and workers from the Tianjin Fifth Textile Factory’s weaving plant thoroughly discussed methods for protecting machinery at a conservation meeting. Conservation worker Sun Dianjia, based on years of experience, suggested that the spring on the shuttle stick was too easily damaged and should be replaced with a bow; after discussion, everyone decided to implement his method. Conservation worker Zhang Peiyou pointed out that the width of the shuttle sticks was not suitable and that they were not easy to use when damp. Everyone pointed out that this was the result of the Tianjin Textile Branch Company not consulting the factory's opinions when purchasing materials in the past. In the future, opinions should be submitted to the branch company's purchasing committee, and purchases should be made according to the drawings and dimensions provided by the factory's engineers to avoid waste. The meeting also decided to establish a strict inspection system. For example, when collecting parts, the machine number must be written down, and the conservation department is responsible for inspection. Any unreasonable waste of parts will be investigated. Those who follow-up with repairs should also check whether the parts on the machines they manage are complete and compliant. If any problems are found, adjustments and repairs should be carried out immediately. At the same time, technicians, engineers, and foremen will conduct inspections to ensure the normal operation of the machines, so as to improve the efficiency of the machines.

　　津市中纺五厂职工
    商讨保全机器办法
    【天津电】天津中纺五厂织布厂技术人员和工人等五十余人，在保全会议上，详细商量保全机器的办法。保全工人孙殿甲根据多年经验，提出打梭棍上的弹簧太易坏，不如改为拉弓子；经大家讨论，决定照他的办法实行。保全工人张佩友提出打梭棍宽窄不合度，并且潮湿不好用；大家指出：这是过去中纺分公司购料时不征求工厂意见的结果，今后则应向分公司购料委员会提出意见，按各厂工程师所画图样和尺寸购买，以免浪费。会中并决定建立严格检查制度。如领取零件要写车号，由保全部负责检查。发现不合理的浪费零件现象即追究责任；跟班修理并检查自己所管理的机器上零件等全不全，合不合规矩，如发现毛病即刻进行调整修配；同时由技术员、技师、工长进行检查，保证机器运转正常，以提高机器的效能。
