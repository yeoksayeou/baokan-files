　　Regarding the Issue of Aggression Against Indonesia
  　The US and the Netherlands Continue to Argue
    Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 9th. Reports from various sources: The Netherlands and US imperialism are still engaged in bargaining disputes over the Indonesian issue. After the Dutch government announced its plan to convene the Hague Round Table Conference, the Indonesian Committee, controlled by the United States, reported to the Security Council on the 1st of this month that its "mediation" work had failed. The committee blamed the Netherlands for refusing to comply with the US plan passed by the Security Council on January 28, "thus causing a stalemate in negotiations;" and condemned the Netherlands for "not cooperating with UN observers," "restricting the movement of observers, and refusing to provide military intelligence." Hatta's and Sukarno's chief representative to the United Nations, Rum (formerly translated as Gem), a loyal lackey of the United States, also reiterated on February 28 his refusal to participate in the round table conference prepared by the Netherlands. Rum accused the Dutch plan of not regarding the US-controlled Indonesian Committee as the "moderator" for resolving the Indonesian issue, but instead reducing the "committee to the position of assistant to the round table conference."
    After the Indonesian Committee and Hatta rejected the Dutch round table conference plan, the Dutch authorities continued to imprison Hatta, Sukarno, and others on Bangka Island, refusing to release them. The Dutch High Commissioner to Indonesia, Beel, issued a statement on the 2nd stating that even if Sukarno and others boycotted the round table conference, the Netherlands would proceed according to the original plan. Beel threatened that the Netherlands was prepared to delay the Hague Conference to await Hatta's consideration, but not for too long. The Dutch government also requested the Security Council on the 3rd to approve the round table conference plan. The Dutch government reported to the Security Council on the Dutch plan, stating: "The Netherlands may grant the Indonesian Republic one-third of the say in the future government (referring to the Indonesian puppet federal government)." According to the Associated Press, "The Dutch plan immediately caused disturbances in the United Nations." The US representative to the United Nations, who was trying to control the entire Indonesia through Hatta, declared on the 4th: "The United States will oppose the Indonesian Committee's participation in the Hague Conference," "The United States will also oppose the United Nations' passage of this plan."

　　对于侵略印尼问题
  　美荷继续争吵
    【新华社陕北九日电】各方报道：荷兰与美帝国主义在印尼问题上仍进行着讨价还价的争吵。当荷兰政府公布召开海牙圆桌会议的计划后，美国控制下的印尼委员会已于本月一日向安理会报告，谓其“调处”工作业已失败。该委员会责备荷兰不肯遵守安理会于一月二十八日通过的美国计划，“因而引起谈判的僵局”；并谴责荷兰“不与联合国观察员合作”，“限制观察员的行动，拒绝供给军事情报”。美国的忠实走狗哈达、苏加诺驻联合国的首席代表鲁姆（前译格姆），亦于二月二十八日重申拒绝参加荷兰准备召集的圆桌会议。鲁姆指责荷兰的计划，不把美国控制的印尼委员会，看作解决印尼问题的“主持者”，却把该“委员会缩小到圆桌会议协助者的地位”。
    在印尼委员会和哈达拒绝了荷兰的圆桌会议计划后，荷当局继续把哈达、苏加诺等监禁于邦加岛，不予释放。荷驻印尼高级专员比尔则于二日发表声明称：纵令苏加诺等对圆桌会议进行抵制，荷兰仍将按原计划进行。比尔威胁着说：荷兰准备延迟海牙会议，以待哈达等考虑，但不能延迟太久。荷政府并于三日要求安理会批准圆桌会议的计划。荷政府向安理会报告荷兰的计划称：“荷兰可能在未来的政府中（指印尼傀儡联邦政府），予印尼共和国以三分之一的发言权”。据合众社称：“荷方的计划立即在联合国引起纷扰”。力图经过哈达以控制整个印尼的美国驻联合国发言人四日宣称：“美国将反对印尼委员会参加海牙会议”，“美国亦将反对联合国通过该项计划”。
