The workers of the "Joint Logistics Headquarters Pingjin Clothing General Factory," which was taken over by the Pingjin Military Control Commission, under the correct guidance of the factory in relying on the proletariat and giving play to the proletariat's initiative, have increased production by nearly one-third compared with the period of Chiang Kai-shek's rule. The factory has a total of nine units (referring to the area of ​​Pingjin) with more than 4,200 employees. Since work began on February 21, it has produced 130,000 sets of military uniforms, 119,000 pairs of leggings, and more than 6,000 military caps. The average output per person per day is 7.8 sets (individual units reach 8 to 10 sets), an increase of 2.6 sets compared with the average output of 5.4 sets per person per day during Chiang Kai-shek's rule. The reasons for the increase in production are primarily due to the factory conducting mobilization education for workers on "working hard to produce and supporting the national liberation war," which led workers to launch production competitions with high labor enthusiasm. Secondly, wages are calculated based on actual goods, which means that each person can earn one-third to two-thirds more grain per month compared to Chiang Kai-shek's period, when wages were calculated in cash (which was affected by price fluctuations). Thirdly, the special agent organ, the "Supervisory Office," which "reported" on workers' thoughts, was abolished, allowing workers to live a free and democratic life with high morale. They organized Yangko teams to carry out collective entertainment in their spare time. (Wei Le)

[News from this newspaper] Since the workers of the first and second shifts of the first sewing department of the Pingjin Clothing Factory automatically initiated the production increase competition, the repair department, the cutting department, and the sewing shifts have all responded. So far, workers in all departments of the factory have been drawn into the production increase competition. In addition to competition between shifts in the sewing shifts, individual and group competitions have also been launched within the same shift. Liang Mancang, a sewing worker from the fourth shift, said: "In the past, the Kuomintang oppressed us, and we were unwilling to work more. Now that our workers' status has been improved, we will naturally work more." Yesterday afternoon, when it was almost time to get off work, a batch of sportswear custom-made by North China University was distributed. The sixth shift automatically rushed to process it, with three people doing two sets each, and it was all completed in more than an hour. The ninth and tenth sewing shifts, who use manual machines, are also unwilling to lag behind and have issued challenges to other departments.

Also reported, the first phase of the workers' study class in the first sewing department of the Pingjin Clothing Factory opened yesterday, with 380 workers signing up to participate in the study. On the 14th to 16th, there were large classes, and comrades from relevant departments were invited to explain the cooperative and wage issues. Later, classes will be divided into cultural and political sections, and will graduate in four weeks. (Chi) (Attached picture)

　　平津被服总厂工人
  　展开竞赛产量提高
    工人积极学习生活愉快
    【本报讯】平市军管会接收之“联勤总部平津被服总厂”，在厂方依靠无产阶级发挥无产阶级积极性的正确方针指导下，产量较蒋匪统治时期提高将达三分之一。该厂共辖九个单位（指平市范围的），有职工四千二百余人。自二月二十一日开工以来，已制成军衣十三万套，绑腿带十一万九千付，军帽六千余顶。每人每天平均产量七点八套（个别单位达八套至十套），较蒋匪统治时期每人每天平均产量五点四套，提高二点六套。增产原因，首由厂方向工人进行“努力生产，支援全国解放战争”的动员教育，使工人纷纷以高度的劳动热忱展开生产竞赛。其次，以实物计算工资，较蒋匪统治时期以现款计算工资（这样要受物价波动影响），每人每月可多赚粮食三分之一至三分之二。第三，废除“检举”工人思想的特务机关——督察室，使工人过着自由民主的生活，情绪很高，他们组织秧歌队，于生产余暇，进行集体娱乐。　（维乐）
    【本报讯】平津被服厂第一缝纫部自从车工一二两班自动发起增产竞赛运动后，修理部、裁剪部、车工各班，都响应起来。到目前为止，全厂各部门工人都卷入增产竞赛。车工班除班与班竞赛外，同班中又发起个人竞赛和分组竞赛。四班车工梁满仓说：“过去国民党压迫我们，我们不愿意多干活，现在我们工人地位提高了，自然要多干活了。”前天下午快放工的时候发下一批华北大学定制的运动衣，六班自动加工突击，三人两套，一个多钟头即全部完工。车工第九、十两班是使人力机的，可是他们也不甘落后，已向其他部门发出了挑战书。
    又讯，平津被服厂第一缝纫部工人学习班第一期昨天开学，报名参加学习的工人有三百八十人。十四日到十六日上大课，请有关部门同志讲解合作社和工资问题。以后分班上课，课程分文化和政治两部，四个星期毕业。　（炽）（附图片）
