To the responsible comrades of various local committees, county committees, and joint offices:

Recently, this newspaper has successively received materials related to spring plowing production plans and this year's production meetings from Jingxing, Quyang County, the Taihang First Special District Office, Wuxiang, Neiqiu, Tunliu, and other places. These materials are all very good. We hope that you can also provide this newspaper with a copy of your local production plan for this year and the details of your production meetings, so that the newspaper can use them and refer to them. Please also pay attention to organizing timely reports on the actual progress of the work.
