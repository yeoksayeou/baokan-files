　　Shijiazhuang Supply and Marketing Cooperative General Office
　　Trials Women's Production Cooperative
　　[Shijiazhuang News] The Shijiazhuang Supply and Marketing Cooperative General Office (formerly the Shijiazhuang Cooperative General Office) and the city's Democratic Women's Federation established a women's production cooperative in mid-February. After half a month of trials, certain achievements have been made. The organization of the women's production cooperative starts with the production of workers' families, military families, cadre families, and poor urban women; in terms of business, based on the production characteristics of urban women, a policy of starting small and growing large was determined. First, women with certain skills are organized to start with stitching cotton wadding and spinning hemp rope. The cooperative undertakes the handicrafts, supplies raw materials, and promotes the finished products. Initially, three or five women were organized to spin hemp on a trial basis. Now, the number of women participating in spinning hemp has expanded to more than 30, and seven or eight women are stitching cotton wadding. In half a month, a total of 64 catties of hemp and more than 400 catties of waste cloth were supplied, and more than 40 catties of hemp rope and more than 140 pieces of cotton wadding were recovered. In the beginning, the women members had a mentality of relying on the public and not taking responsibility. As a result, the quality of the cotton wadding was poor, and the raw materials for spinning hemp were large, which caused the cooperative to lose money. Later, the cooperative educated the members and explained that it supplies raw materials to members at prices lower than the market price, and purchases finished products at prices slightly higher than those of peddlers for promotion. Therefore, the quality of finished products and production technology have improved. In addition, it has also entrusted various supply and marketing cooperatives to undertake handicrafts on its behalf, and has disassembled and washed four quilts and one bed sheet. The women who received wages were very happy, and recently, groups of three to five women have been coming to the production cooperative every day looking for work.
　　The experience of the past half month is that first, production must be organized practically starting from small things, and the business policy of supply and marketing must be correctly implemented. Secondly, in organizing production, attention must be paid to absorbing a part of people with certain skills to serve as the backbone, and the comrades working in the cooperative must also be familiar with the business. In the future, it is also necessary to always prevent the mentality of giving alms, and to organize women from the perspective of production, so as to better combine their own business with the work of mobilizing women.

　　石市供销合作总社
  　试办妇女生产合作社
    【石家庄讯】石家庄供销合作总社（原石家庄合作总社）与本市民主妇联会，于二月中旬举办妇女生产合作社，经半月试验，已获得一定成绩。妇女生产合作社组织从工人家属、军人家属、干部家属及贫苦市民妇女的生产入手；业务上则根据城市妇女的生产特点，确定了由小到大的方针。首先将有一定技术的妇女组织起来，从打袷纸、纺麻绳作起，由合作社包揽手工，供给原料，推销成品。开始组织了三、五个妇女纺麻作试验，现在参加纺麻妇女已扩大到三十多人，打袷纸妇女七、八人，半月来供给原料计麻六十四斤，破布四百余斤，收回麻绳四十多斤，袷纸一百四十多张。开始时妇女社员曾有过一种依靠公家、不负责任的思想。结果袷纸质量差，纺麻原料大，合作社因而亏了本。后来，合作社对社员进行了教育，并说明供给社员低于市价的原料，收购成品则略高于小贩的价格予以推销，因此成品质量与生产技术都有提高。此外，还委托各供销社，代为包揽手工，已拆洗了四条被褥，一条床单。拿到工资的妇女们都非常高兴，近来每天都有三、五成群的妇女到生产合作社来找活。
    半月来工作的经验，首先必须切实的从小处入手组织生产，正确的执行供销的业务方针。其次，组织生产中，必须注意吸收一部分有一定技术的作骨干，而合作社工作同志也必须熟习业务。今后还需时刻防止恩赐观点，要从生产出发组织妇女，使自己的业务和组织发动妇女工作更好的结合起来。
