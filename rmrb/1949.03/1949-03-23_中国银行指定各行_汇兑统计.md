　　Bank of China Designated Banks
    Remittance Statistics
    [Our Newspaper] Since the Bank of China in this city officially opened on the 15th, the amount of outward remittances handled by the bank's designated banks in the five days up to last Saturday (the 19th), according to the bank's statistics: 55 outward remittances, totaling 1,326,300 yuan. 47 inward remittances, totaling 2,610,095 yuan and 85 cents. According to the person in charge of the bank: Because the Foreign Trade Administration has not yet established an office in Peiping, it is quite inconvenient for merchants to apply for permits, so the number of commercial remittances is extremely small. More than 80% of the outward remittances already processed are family support payments or tuition fees.

　　中国银行指定各行
    汇兑统计
    【本报讯】本市中国银行自十五日正式开业后，截至上星期六（十九日）五天内经该行各指定银行所经办之区外汇兑，据该行统计：汇出者五十五笔，共一百三十二万六千三百元。汇入者四十七笔，共二百六十一万零九十五元八角五分。据该行负责人谈：由于对外贸易管理局在平尚未设立办事处，商人申请许可颇不方便，所以商业汇兑数目极少，已办之汇出款项百分之八十以上均为赡家费或学费。
