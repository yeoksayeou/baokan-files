Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, 5th: Since the establishment of the Workers' Inquiry Office by the Tianjin Office of the Preparatory Committee of the North China Federation of Trade Unions, it has been of great help to factories that have not been assigned work teams and to unemployed workers in general. From January 17th to February 10th, within 23 days, more than 2,000 workers, both employed and unemployed, came to inquire. Some recounted the sufferings they had endured in the past; some came to report that certain bureaucrat-capitalist-run factories had not yet been taken over; some reported on the activities of bad people; some sought appropriate solutions because the capitalists had dismissed workers without reason or were in arrears with wages; some inquired about ways to solve the unemployment problem caused by the Kuomintang's criminal rule. The comrades in the Inquiry Office gave these workers a warm reception, and answered the questions raised at the time, or the Inquiry Office was responsible for introducing them to the relevant authorities for contact, or helped to solve the problems. More than 30 child laborers of the Deji Paint Factory, who had been dismissed without reason before the liberation of the city, came to the Inquiry Office to inquire about the handling method. After the comrades of the Inquiry Office explained that the capitalists should not dismiss workers at will, and further publicized the policy of benefiting both labor and capital, they were introduced to the Third District Government for assistance in solving the problem. Two days later, two 17-year-old child laborers ran over happily and said: "We have resumed work. The trade union in the past did not care about the workers, but the current trade union is really working for us workers!" The Inquiry Office, while solving the workers' difficulties, also tried to understand the situation of the workers in various ways and provided it to the relevant authorities for reference.

　　津设立职工问事处  帮助工人解决问题
    【新华社天津五日电】华北总工会筹备委员会天津办事处的职工问事处设立后，对于没有派遣工作组的工厂以及一般失业工人帮助很大。从一月十七日到二月十日二十三天内，前往问事的在业或失业职工在二千人以上，其中有的诉说过去所受的痛苦；有的来报告某些官僚资本经营的工厂还没有派人接管；有的检举了坏人活动；有的因为资方无故解雇工人或拖欠工资，来求得适当的解决；有的因在国民党罪恶统治下造成了失业，来询问解决失业问题的办法。问事处工作同志对这些职工都予以殷勤接待，对所提问题，或当时给以解答，或由问事处负责介绍前往各有关机关接洽。或帮助予以解决。德记颜料厂在本市解放前被无故解雇的三十多个童工，到问事处询问处理办法，经问事处同志解释资方不得随意解雇工人，并进而宣传了劳资两利的方针之后，又介绍给三区政府协助解决。两天后，两个十七岁的童工跑来高兴地说：“我们复工了，过去的工会不管工人，现在的工会真是给咱们工人办事的！”问事处一面解决工人的疑难，一面多方了解职工情况，提供给有关机关参考。
