Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 5th. The die-hard Kuomintang pseudo-Executive President Sun Ke arrived in Nanjing from Guangzhou on the 28th of last month, and hastily disguised himself as a "peace" envoy in Nanjing. Sun Ke, who once dreamed of relying on the civil and military reactionaries concentrated in Guangzhou to support himself, declared in mid-February that he would not return to Nanjing. One explanation was that "his blood pressure was too high and he could not come for the time being," another was that "his mother urged him to rest in Macau," and yet another was that "he would rather resign than return to Nanjing." In less than half a month, suddenly his blood pressure was not high, his mother did not urge him to rest, and he did not express his resignation. The reason for this is nothing more than his crushing defeat in the political gambling den. Not only were there few pseudo-legislators who went to Guangzhou, but the Executive Yuan, which claimed to move to Guangzhou, was also fragmented. It is said that among the seventeen ministries of the pseudo-Executive Yuan, eight did not have responsible heads. Sun Ke had hoped that the United Nations would interfere in China's internal affairs, but this hope also failed. After returning to Nanjing with a brazen face, Sun Ke tried his best to show that he was the earliest inventor of "peace" commodities, and advocated direct talks with the Communist Party, because "according to the provisions of the United Nations Charter, the United Nations should not directly participate in mediating a country's internal disputes." Sun Ke fabricated rumors that the contradictions in his proposals were due to some changes in the proposals of the Chinese Communist Party. But everyone knows that the Chinese Communist Party's peace proposal has been consistent since January 14, and that proposal is the eight peace conditions announced by Chairman Mao Zedong. Sun Ke had openly opposed this proposal, saying that there should be an unconditional ceasefire, and that "if the Communist Party puts forward the punishment of war criminals, it is absolutely unacceptable." The Communist Party is still insisting on implementing the eight conditions, the first of which is to punish war criminals including Sun Ke. For people like Sun Ke, there is indeed no "glory" to be taken, and there is no "equality" to speak of. But why doesn't Sun Ke openly oppose it now? The trickery here cannot but reveal loopholes. People like Sun Ke are still actively preparing for war, only learning from the experience of the failure in Guangzhou, and knowing that it is now necessary to continue using "peace talks" as a cover.

　　在政治赌窟中遭受惨败
    战犯孙科厚颜返南京
  　续用“和谈”掩护备战
    【新华社陕北五日电】国民党死硬派伪行政院长孙科于上月二十八日由广州抵南京，并在南京匆忙地把自己改妆为“和平”使者。一度幻想依托集中于广州的文武反动派以自重的孙科，在上月中旬还宣称不回南京，一说是因“血压过高，暂时不能前来”，另一说是因“他的母亲敦促他到澳门休息”，又一说是“他宁愿辞职不愿返回南京”。不到半个月，忽然血压也不高了，母亲也不敦促他休息了，也不表示辞职了，其原因没有别的，就是因为他在政治赌窟中的惨败。不但伪立法委员去广州者寥寥，就是宣称迁往广州的行政院也是支离破碎。据称：在伪行政院的十七个部会中，就有八个没有负责首脑。孙科曾希望联合国对于中国内政实行干涉，但是这个希望亦未成功。在厚着脸皮回到南京以后，孙科竭力表白自己是“和平”商品的最早发明家，并且主张与共产党直接商谈，因为他“照联合国宪章之规定，联合国当不易直接参与调解某一国家内部之争。”孙科造谣说他的主张的前后矛盾是由于中共的主张发生了什么变化。但是人们都知道中共的和平主张从一月十四日以来是始终一贯的，这个主张就是毛泽东主席所宣布的八项和平条件。孙科曾公开反对这个主张，说是要无条件停战，又说是“如共党所提出之惩治战犯一节，即系绝对不能接受者”。共产党现在仍然是坚持实行八项条件，其第一条就是要惩治包括孙科在内的战犯，对于孙科之流确是既无“光荣”之足取，尤无“平等”之可言。但是孙科为什么又不公开反对了呢？骗术在这里不能不露出漏洞。孙科之流仍然是积极准备战争的，仅仅是鉴于广州失败之经验，深知现在必需继续用“和谈”来作为掩护而已。
