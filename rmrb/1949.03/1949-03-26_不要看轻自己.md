　　Don't Underestimate Yourself
    When I was little, I only went to school for two years in a rural primary school. Later, I went to work in a factory. The factories in the old days belonged to the capitalists, and they used every method to exploit and oppress the workers. The workers lived like beasts of burden, barely able to breathe, let alone have the opportunity to learn culture. Therefore, before long, most of the few characters I knew were forgotten, and I became functionally illiterate. After the people's savior—the Communist Party-led People's Liberation Army liberated Yangquan, I continued to work in the factory. At this time, the factory belonged to the workers themselves. The trade union purchased various books to help us improve our political, cultural, and technical skills. In our spare time, we could read books and newspapers ourselves to improve our culture. So I started learning culture again, slowly learning to read books and newspapers. When there were characters I didn't recognize, I asked those comrades who came from student backgrounds. They weren't bothered at all and taught me very patiently. I would take my notebook and learn to write. As a result of doing this regularly, after half a year, I could understand ordinary books and newspapers. Sometimes I even wrote articles for the factory newspaper. The reason I was able to study hard and improve my culture was because I didn't underestimate myself. Fellow workers, don't underestimate yourselves either. When you have free time, go to the trade union to read books and newspapers. If you don't recognize characters, ask others. As long as you are patient in learning, the future is unlimited.

　　不要看轻自己
    我在小的时候，在农村小学只念过两年书；后来就到工厂里做工。从前的工厂是资本家的，他们用尽各种方法，剥削压迫工人，工人过着牛马似的生活，连气都喘不过来，哪里还有学习文化的机会呢？因此不久，我认的几个字就大都忘记了，成了个睁眼的瞎子。自从人民的救星——共产党领导的解放军解放了阳泉后，我还是继续在工厂里工作，这时的工厂是属于工人自己的了，职工会为了帮助我们提高政治、文化、和技术，购买了各种书籍，我们在业余时间，就可以自己看书看报，提高文化，于是我又开始学习文化，慢慢的学着看书报，有不认识的字，我就问那些学生出身的同志，他们一点不嫌麻烦，很耐心的教给我，我就拿上自己的本子学着写。经常这样做的结果，经过半年的工夫，我就能看懂普通的书报了，有时我还给职工报写稿。我能够努力学习，努力提高文化，是因为我没把自己看轻。工友同志们，你们也不要把自己看轻了，有闲时就到工会看书报，不认识的字就问别人，只要自己耐心学习前途是无限的。
