　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 6th. TASS Moscow dispatch: *Izvestia* published a commentary on the 3rd regarding the growing mass movement against the instigators of a new war, especially the mass movements in countries subjected to the Marshall Plan. The *Izvestia* commentator pointed out: When the American ruling clique rejected the proposal to conclude a peace treaty between the Soviet Union and the United States, most sober-minded commentators in the United States could not conceal their concern about the consequences of this step, because it greatly exposed the aggressive intentions of American policy. All countries have drawn their own conclusions from this latest manifestation of the blatant aggressive political line of the Anglo-American bloc. The people of all countries are uniting their forces to fight for peace in response to the war threats deepened by the plans for the North Atlantic Treaty and other treaties. The commentator said: Everyone knows that aggressors are formulating their sinister plans under the cover of the war mania they themselves create. When they see that the heroic struggles of the fighters for peace are dispelling the signs of this artificially created tense atmosphere, they are even more disappointed. The growing unity between the people of all countries and the great fortress of peace—the Soviet Union—is particularly infuriating to the international reactionaries. Enraged, the reactionaries fiercely attack those who expose the aggressors' plans and support friendship with the Soviet Union. It is becoming increasingly clear that one of the purposes of the North Atlantic Treaty is to crush the democratic movements within the countries that sign this treaty. The *Izvestia* commentator recounted a message from a Washington correspondent of the Associated Press, which stated that the North Atlantic Treaty would have secret clauses stipulating that collective measures would be taken once any country participating in the treaty "is threatened by aggression that does not use force." It is easy to guess that this clause could be used as a pretext for the United States to interfere in the internal affairs of other countries to support reactionary groups in power against the will of the people. Therefore, it is not surprising that countries that recognize these plans as a threat to their own survival are opposing this threat, opposing the policy of aggression, and opposing the policy of launching war with increasing determination. The commentator concluded: Every day makes the words of Marshal Stalin, the leader of the Soviet government, more powerful. He said: "The people of all countries still have fresh memories of the horrors of the last war. The strength of the peace-loving masses is so great for the Churchill disciples who are carrying out aggression that they cannot overcome this force and cannot turn this force to a new war."

    捶击国际反动派的战争威胁  全世界反战群众运动高涨
    【新华社陕北六日电】塔斯社莫斯科讯：消息报于三日评论反对新战争挑拨者的日益增长的群众运动，特别是马歇尔计划化各国中的群众运动。消息报评论员指出：当美国统治集团拒绝了在苏美之间缔结和平公约的建议时，美国多数头脑清醒的评论员，无法掩盖他们对这一步骤之后果的忧虑，因为它大大暴露了美国政策的侵略目的。各个国家都从美英集团露骨侵略性的政治路线的又一次新表示中，作出了他们自己的结论。各国人民团结他们的力量进行争取和平的斗争，来答复因北大西洋公约及其他公约的计划而加深了的战争威胁。评论员说：大家都知道，侵略者正在他们自己制造的战争狂的掩盖下面，拟制他们的罪恶计划。当他们看到争取和平的战士们的英勇斗争驱散了这种人工制造的紧张空气的迹象时，他们更是大感失望了。各国人民与伟大的和平堡垒——苏联之间的团结越来越增长了，这使国际反动派特别恼怒。恼羞成怒的反动派，就猛烈攻击那些揭露侵略者的计划和拥护对苏友好的人们。北大西洋公约的目的之一，是要粉碎那些签订这一条约的国家之内的民主运动，这已经是一天天地更为明显了。消息报评论员追述合众社华盛顿记者所发的消息，该消息称：北大西洋公约将有秘密条款，规定一旦参加公约的任何国家“遭到未使用武力的侵略之威胁”时，采用集体措施。很容易猜出，这一条可用作美国干涉他国内政，以支持反对人民意志之反动集团政权的借口。因此，认识到这些计划威胁它们自己的生存的国家，就以日益增加的决心来反对这种威胁、反对侵略政策、反对发动战争的政策，这是毫不足怪的。评论员结语说：每一天都使苏联政府领袖斯大林元帅所说的话更有力量。他说：“上次战争的惨象，各国人民的记忆犹新。主张和平的人民大众的力量，对于进行侵略的邱吉尔门徒们来说，是如此强大，他们战胜不了这种力量，不能将这种力量转向新的战争去。”
