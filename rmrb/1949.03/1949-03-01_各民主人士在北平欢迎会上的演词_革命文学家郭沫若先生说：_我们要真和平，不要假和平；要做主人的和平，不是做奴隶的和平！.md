Xinhua News Agency, Beiping, 27th. The speech of the famous Chinese revolutionary writer Guo Moruo at the Beiping welcome meeting on the 26th.

　　"How much people's blood, exchanged for this glory.
　　Thinking of it, tears want to fall, unable to laugh."

　　Today is truly a moment of supreme glory. I never dreamed that I could return to Beiping as openly as an emperor on tour, and speak in the emperor's palace. This is truly something I never dreamed of. We can obtain such glory, of course, thanks to the leaders, the People's Liberation Army, the vanguard of the proletariat, the Chinese Communist Party, and the wise people's leader, Chairman Mao Zedong. The people's armed forces led by Chairman Mao have liberated the Chinese people, and have also turned Guo Moruo around. I am truly endlessly moved.

　　But I also know that this glory does not come without a price. To put it further back, the Chinese people, under more than two thousand years of feudal rule, have repeatedly engaged in countless bloody struggles. To put it closer, since the Opium War, the Chinese people have shed countless blood in their internal opposition to feudal exploitation and their external opposition to imperialist aggression. To put it even closer, since Chiang Kai-shek's purge of the Party in April 1927, how many communists has he slaughtered, how many patriotic youths has he slaughtered, how many workers and peasants has he slaughtered? It is the blood of these countless martyrs that has solidified into our glory today. When I recall it, I cannot help but shed tears. Yesterday, when I arrived at the East Railway Station in Beiping, I wrote a few lines of poetry on the train, which can well express my own state of mind. "How much people's blood, exchanged for this glory. Thinking of it, tears want to fall, unable to laugh." Therefore, I think that today, we have obtained such glory, and it goes without saying that we should also thank the martyrs of all ages and always commemorate them.

　　We enjoy such glory, and we should also expand this glory. Today, south of the Yangtze River, half of our compatriots are still trapped in an extremely unfree life. We should liberate them as soon as possible and jointly enjoy the joy of liberation. Indeed, the people of all of China hope for peace, but what they hope for is genuine peace, not false peace, peace as masters, not peace as slaves. In order to strive for genuine peace, Chinese history shows us that the Chinese people do not hesitate to sacrifice their lives and blood. Today, the heinous Nanjing reactionary government, under its crumbling situation, is using the guise of peace in an attempt to slow down the steps of the revolution so that they can rise from the ashes. They are shouting "glorious peace." They have been "glorious" for twenty-three years, and they still want to be "glorious" today. But with the "glory" of the reactionaries, there is no glory for the people, no peace for the people. The peace we want to strive for is the genuine peace of the people's democracy. This can only be achieved by faithfully implementing the eight conditions put forward by Chairman Mao on January 14 and the supplementary explanation for punishing war criminals. The liberation of Beiping is a very good model. But what the reactionaries want is not such peace.

　　Extend our glory to South China, West China, Hainan Island, and Taiwan, and plant the banner of Mao Zedong all over China!

　　The reactionaries, on the one hand, keep shouting for peace, mourning as if they had lost their parents, seemingly pleading for the people. But what are they doing? Nanjing is slaughtering youths, Shanghai is slaughtering workers, and many patriotic people are being secretly thrown into the Yangtze River for water burial. Kunming, Xi'an, and other places are intensifying the slaughter. On the other hand, they are desperately destroying state property, desperately transferring it to the Americas, Hong Kong, and Taiwan, stubbornly colluding with American imperialism and Japanese imperialism, and absurdly declaring the Japanese bandit Okamura Yasuji innocent and releasing him, while also sending 260 Japanese war criminals back to Japan. It is truly amazing. This can truly be regarded as a historically unprecedented and great act of betrayal. Is this perhaps the "glory" they are talking about? They are shouting for peace with such "glory." I am sorry, but we have to take off their "glorious hats"! With the glory of traitors, there is no glory for the people. We want to extend the glory of our people to South China, West China, Hainan Island, and Taiwan, and plant the banner of Mao Zedong all over China.

　　We enjoy today's glory, and we should also maintain this glory forever, and not let it be reduced, deteriorated, or lost. This is the sacred mission of every Chinese. This can only be achieved by all parties, people's organizations, and progressive people in the country working together with one heart and one mind, under the leadership of the most revolutionary vanguard of the proletariat, on the one hand, carrying the revolutionary war to the end, and on the other hand, engaging in production and construction. China is large, too backward, and its development is too unbalanced. In future construction work, whether in spiritual production or material production, we must make special efforts to truly achieve "if one person can do it, I will do it a hundred times; if one person can do it ten times, I will do it a thousand times." Only then can we quickly catch up with the most advanced countries in the world. We must have one person do the work of a hundred people in order to maintain the glory of our people and prevent it from ever being reduced, deteriorated, or lost. This glorious and sacred mission should be accomplished by us. Under the rule of the reactionaries, China has not been doing well, and we have excuses to shirk responsibility. Under today's people's regime, if we still fail to do well in China, then we will become historical sinners. My brothers and I feel this way today. In order to expand our glory and consolidate our glory, each of us should eliminate our selfish intentions, get rid of all sectarian prejudices, and unconditionally dedicate all our strength, all our spirit, and all our lives to complete the tasks of anti-imperialism, anti-feudalism, and anti-bureaucratic capitalism under the leadership of the CCP and Chairman Mao, and devote ourselves to building a new China.

　　各民主人士在北平欢迎会上的演词
    革命文学家郭沫若先生说：“我们要真和平，不要假和平；要做主人的和平，不是做奴隶的和平！”
  “多少人民血，换来此尊荣。
    思之泪欲堕，欢笑不成声。”
    【新华社北平二十七日电】著名的中国革命文学家郭沫若在二十六日北平欢迎会上的演词。
    今天真正是光荣绝顶了。从来没有做过这样的梦，公然能够象皇帝出巡一样回到北平，又在皇帝的宫殿里讲话，真真是从来所没有梦想过的。我们能够得到这样的光荣，当然要感谢各位首长，感谢人民解放军，感谢无产阶级的先锋队中国共产党，感谢英明的人民领袖毛泽东主席。毛主席所领导的人民武力，使中国人民翻了身，使我郭沫若也翻了一个身，我真是感动无尽的。
    但我也知道，这光荣不是毫无代价得来的。说远一点，中国人民在两千多年的封建统治之下，循环返复在作过无数次的流血斗争。说近一点，自鸦片战争以来，中国人民对内反对封建主义的剥削，对外反对帝国主义的侵略，也流过无数次的血。更说近一点，自从一九二七年四月蒋介石清党以来，他屠杀了多少共产党员，屠杀了多少爱国青年，屠杀了多少工农大众呀。就是这些无数千万的先烈的血凝成了我们今天的光荣，我一回想起来便不免要流出眼泪。昨天我到北平东车站的时候，在车上做了几句诗，大可以表示我自己的心境。“多少人民血，换来此尊荣。思之泪欲堕，欢笑不成声。”因此，我想我们今天得到了这样的光荣，不用说我们同时也应该向历代的先烈们感谢，永远纪念着他们的。
    我们享受了这样的光荣，还应该扩大这种光荣。今天在长江以南，我们的一半同胞还困顿在极不自由的生活里面。我们应该早早把他们解放出来，共同享受翻身的快乐。不错，全中国的人民是希望和平的，但所希望的是真正的和平而不是假的和平，是做主人的和平，而不是做奴隶的和平。为了争取真正的和平，中国的历史照示我们：中国人民是毫不吝惜自己的生命和鲜血的。今天恶贯满盈的南京反动政府在摇摇欲坠的局势下边，正在借着和平的幌子，企图缓和革命的步骤，让他们能够死灰复燃。他们在喊叫着“光荣的和平”。他们“光荣”了廿三年，到了今天都还想“光荣”下去。但有了反动派的“光荣”，便没有人民的光荣，便没有人民的和平。我们所要争取的和平便是人民民主的真正的和平。这只有根据毛主席在一月十四日所提出的八项条件和对于惩办战犯的补充说明，不折不扣地实现了，然后才能得到。北平的解放就是一个很好的模范。但是反动派所要的不是这样的和平。
    要把我们的光荣扩展到华南、华西、海南岛、台湾，把毛泽东的旗帜插遍全中国！
    反动派一面尽管在喊和平，如丧考妣地在那儿仿佛为民请命。但他们干的是什么呢？南京在屠杀青年，上海在屠杀工友，把多少爱国志士秘密地投进长江水葬，昆明西安等地都在加紧屠杀。而在另外一方面呢？把国家财产拚命的破坏，拚命地转移到美洲、香港、台湾，死心踏地的和美帝、和日帝勾结，荒谬绝伦地竟把日酋冈村宁次宣判无罪，加以释放，而同时还把二百六十名日本战犯也送回日本去了。真是了不起，这真可以算是古今中外空前伟大的一个卖国行为。大约这就是他们所说的“光荣”了吧？他们在以这样的“光荣”在喊叫和平，对不住得很，只好把他们“光荣的帽子”揭下来！有了卖国贼的光荣，便没有人民的光荣。我们要把我们人民的光荣扩展到华南、华西、海南岛、台湾，把毛泽东的旗帜插遍全中国。
    我们享受着今天的光荣，我们还应该把这光荣永远保持下去，不要使它降低、变质、失坠。这是我们每一个中国人的神圣的使命。这只有全国各党派，各人民团体，各进步人士同志同德，一致团结，在最富有革命性的无产阶级先锋队的领导之下，一面把革命战争进行到底，一面从事生产建设，然后才能办到。中国的地方大，落后得太远，发展得太不平衡，今后在建设工作上，无论在精神生产方面或物质生产方面，都须要我们特别的努力，真真正正地做到“人一能之己百之，人十能之，已千之。”然后才能够很快追上世界上最进步的国家，要这样一个人做一百个人的事，才能够保持我们的人民的光荣，而使它永不降低，永不变质，永不失坠。这个光荣而神圣的使命，我们是应该努力完成的。在反动派统治之下，中国没有搞好，我们有话可以推诿。在今天人民政权之下，假使依然把中国搞不好，那我们就要成为历史的罪人了。我兄弟今天是这样感觉着，为了扩大我们的光荣，为了巩固我们的光荣，我们每一个人都应该扫除一己的的私心，摒除一切的门户之见，要把全部的力量，全部的精神，全部的生命，无条件地拿出来，在中共领导之下，在毛主席领导之下，完成反帝、反封建、反官僚资本主义的任务，为建设新中国而鞠躬尽瘁。
