[Zhangjiakou Telegram] The Chahar Province Women's Congress was held on the 9th of last month and closed on the 15th. The Congress sent a telegram to the Preparatory Committee of the All-China Democratic Women's Federation, endorsing the convening of the National Women's Congress this spring to establish a leading body for the national women's movement—the All-China Democratic Women's Federation, stating: "In a spirit of self-criticism, we have deeply examined the shortcomings in the women's movement, enthusiastically discussed the CCP Central Committee's decision on rural women's work in the liberated areas, and formulated specific work plans based on this policy and task. We have fully exercised democracy, re-elected the Provincial Women's Federation, and selected representatives to attend the National Women's Congress. The women of our province will use this to wish the congress a successful opening!"
