On Soviets and the Soviet Union
    The "Reading Newspaper Dictionary" on page three of this newspaper on the 15th of this month had some errors in its explanation of "Soviet Union." Now, we will give a more detailed introduction. We also thank comrades Jiang Qisheng and Liu Yizhi for their feedback.
    I. Soviet
    Soviet originally meant representative council. The first Soviet to appear in our country was during the 1905 Revolution, composed of representatives of workers in St. Petersburg. From the beginning of the February Revolution in 1917 to the following year, Soviets composed of workers' and soldiers' representatives appeared extensively in various industrial centers and even throughout the country. Lenin's famous slogan "All power to the Soviets" was fully realized.
    Currently, throughout the Soviet Union, large and small villages, towns, cities, districts, provinces, and border regions all have local Soviets, responsible for leading local economic, cultural, and political construction.
    Each union republic and each autonomous republic has a Supreme Soviet, responsible for implementing all state power in that country; participating in the election of representatives to the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union or the Supreme Soviet of the union republic to which the autonomous republic belongs.
    The Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union is the highest organ of state power in the Soviet Union. According to the constitution, the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union has the main powers of legislation, promulgation of all-union laws (resolutions and laws of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union have the same effect), approval of the constitutions of the union republics, acceptance of new union republics, approval of the unified state budget of the Soviet Union, determination of important foreign affairs and war and peace issues, organization of national defense, and leadership of armed forces.
    The Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union is composed of two chambers: the Soviet of the Union and the Soviet of Nationalities. The Soviet of the Union is composed of one representative elected by Soviet citizens for every 300,000 people in an electoral district. The Soviet of Nationalities is composed of 25 representatives elected by each union republic; 11 representatives elected by each autonomous republic; 5 representatives elected by each autonomous province; and 1 representative elected by each national region.
    The Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union meets twice a year (temporary meetings are held when necessary). During the adjournment, the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet exercises state power in accordance with the constitution. Therefore, the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet is the highest permanent organ of state power in the Soviet Union. This Presidium is elected from among the representatives at a joint session of the two chambers. It consists of 33 people: one chairman; sixteen vice-chairmen (one from each union republic); one secretary; and fifteen members.
    The highest executive and directive organ of the Soviet state government is the Council of Ministers (the Soviet government), which is responsible to the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union and its Presidium.
    The formation of Soviets at all levels is based on universal, equal, direct, and secret elections by all male and female working people, regardless of race, nationality, occupation, education level, or religious belief. The Soviet is the most mass-based revolutionary regime, fully representing the will of the working people.
    II. Soviet Union
    In December 1922, when the revolutionary forces had driven out the foreign armed interventionists, and socialist construction and national defense tasks required the consolidation of the Soviet state alliance, Lenin and Stalin proposed to the First All-Union Congress of Soviets to establish a voluntary state union of various Soviet nations – the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics. At that time, four Soviet socialist republics, namely Russia, Transcaucasia, Ukraine, and Byelorussia, joined the alliance and formally announced its establishment. The "Soviet Union" or "Soviet Alliance" that we often use is the abbreviation of this "Union of Soviet Socialist Republics." It is incorrect to call the "Union of Soviet Socialist Republics" the "Socialist Soviet Union" or to abbreviate it as "Soviet Federal Republic" or "Soviet Russia."
    The Soviet Federal Socialist Republic (such as the Russian Soviet Federal Socialist Republic; it is also incorrect to abbreviate this republic as "Soviet Russia") or various Soviet socialist republics that directly join the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics are called union republics. A total of sixteen union republics have joined the Soviet Union successively, completely voluntarily, retaining the right to freely withdraw from the alliance; and their status within the alliance is completely equal. The union republics have their own national constitutions and laws (which must not conflict with the constitution and laws of the Soviet Union); retain territorial rights; and in 1944, the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union also passed laws that allowed each union republic to establish its own army and establish direct diplomatic relations with foreign countries.
    Within the union republics, in addition to the basic population, some areas are also inhabited by people of another nationality. These nationalities can voluntarily organize autonomous republics, enjoying national autonomy rights. The autonomous republics join the union republics and join the Soviet Union through the union republics.
    Ethnic minorities living within a union republic can voluntarily organize autonomous provinces and enjoy autonomy rights on issues of life within the province.
    In addition, in the territories of several provinces or border regions within the Russian Soviet Federal Socialist Republic, there are also organizations of national regions, which are voluntarily organized according to even smaller nationalities and enjoy autonomy rights over life within the region.
    The Union of Soviet Socialist Republics has approximately sixty different nationalities, who are united into an unbreakable alliance on the basis of socialism, in accordance with the principles of national equality and voluntarism of Lenin, Stalin, and the Bolshevik Party.

### 关于苏维埃与苏维埃联盟

　　关于苏维埃与苏维埃联盟
    本月十五日本报第三版“读报小辞典”关于“苏联”的解释有某些错误之处，现在详细地介绍一下。另蒙蒋齐生、刘一之两同志提出意见，并致谢意。
    一、苏维埃
    苏维埃，原是代表会的意思。出现在我国的第一个苏维埃是在一九○五年的革命期间，由彼得堡的工人代表所组成的。一九一七年二月革命开始及至以后一年内，各个工业中心以至全国各地，普遍地出现了工人士兵代表所组成的苏维埃，列宁“全部政权归苏维埃”的著名口号，得到了完全的实现。
    现在，全苏联境内的大小村镇、市、区、省、边区都有地方苏维埃，负责领导地方的经济、文化及政治建设。
    每个加盟共和国，每个自治共和国有最高苏维埃，负责实施该国家的全部政权；参加苏联最高苏维埃或自治共和国所加入的那个加盟共和国的最高苏维埃代表的选举。
    苏联最高苏维埃，是苏联最高的国家政权机关。根据宪法规定，苏联最高苏维埃具有立法、颁布全联盟法律（苏联最高苏维埃的决议与法律有同样效力），批准加盟共和国宪法、接受新加盟共和国、批准苏联统一的国家预算、决定重要外交及和战问题、组织国防及领导武装力量等主要权力。
    苏联最高苏维埃是由联盟苏维埃（联盟院），民族苏维埃（民族院）两院构成：联盟苏维埃是由苏联公民按选举区域每三十万人口选代表一人所组成。民族苏维埃是由每一加盟共和国选代表二十五人；每一自治共和国选代表十一人；每一自治省选代表五人；每一民族州还代表一人所组成。
    苏联最高苏维埃每年开会两次（必要时举行临时会），闭会期间，由最高苏维埃主席团根据宪法实施国家政权，因此，最高苏维埃主席团就是苏联最高的、常任的、国家政权机关。这个主席团，是在两院联席会上，从代表中选出来的。共计三十三人，即：主席一人；副主席十六人（每一加盟共和国一人）；秘书一人；委员十五人。
    苏联国家政府的最高执行与指令机关，是部长会议（苏联政府），它向苏联最高苏维埃及其主席团负责。
    各级苏维埃的产生，都是不分人种、民族、职业、教育程度、宗教信仰由一切男女劳动人民普遍、平等、直接、秘书选举出来的，苏维埃是最具有群众性的，完全代表劳动人民意志的革命政权。
    二、苏维埃联盟
    一九二二年十二月，当革命力量已经赶走了外国的武装干涉者，社会主义建设和国防任务上都需要巩固苏维埃国家联盟的时候，列宁、斯大林向第一次全苏联苏维埃代表大会提议，成立各个苏维埃民族自愿的国家联合——苏维埃社会主义共和国联盟。当时有俄罗斯、南高加索、乌克兰、别洛罗西亚等四个苏维埃社会主义共和国加入了联盟，并正式宣布成立。我们常用的“苏联”或“苏维埃联盟”，就是这个“苏维埃社会主义共和国联盟”的简称。把“苏维埃社会主义共和国联盟”称做“社会主义苏维埃联盟”，或简称“苏维埃联邦共和国”、“苏俄”等都是不对的。
    直接加入苏维埃社会主义共和国联盟的苏维埃联邦社会主义共和国（如俄罗斯苏维埃联邦共和国，对这个共和国简称“苏俄”，也是错误的）或各个苏维埃社会主义共和国，都称做加盟共和国。先后加入苏联的加盟共和国共计有十六个，完全是出于自愿，保有自由退盟的权利；而且在联盟内的地位一律平等。加盟共和国有自己国家的宪法和法律（不得与苏联的宪法及法律相抵触）；保有领土权；一九四四年苏联最高苏维埃并通过了各加盟共和国可以建立自己的军队，可以和外国直接建立外交关系的法令。
    加盟共和国内，除了基本人口以外，某些地区还住有另一种民族的人民，这些民族可以自愿地组织自治共和国，享有国家的自治权利，自治共和国加入加盟共和国，并通过加盟共和国加入苏联。
    住在某一加盟共和国境内的少数民族，可以自顾组织自治省的民族，在省内的生活问题上享有自治权利。
    此外，在俄罗斯苏维埃联邦共和国内的若干省份或边区版图中，还有民族州的组织，是依照更少数的民族的自愿组织起来的，享有对州内生活上的自治权利。
    苏维埃社会主义共和国联盟，约有六十个不同的民族，他们依照着列宁、斯大林、布尔塞维克党的民族平等自愿的原则，在社会主义的基础上团结成牢不可破的联盟。
