　　A Bustling Scene

    Introduction to the Zhangjiakou People's Education Center
    Yang Xinghua

    In early January, the Zhangjiakou Municipal People's Education Center's main center and three branch centers were successively established. In the past two months, the Social Services Department has answered many difficult questions from the masses. For questions of a general nature, answers are submitted to the Chahar Daily; for questions of a smaller scope with guiding significance, answers are posted on the blackboard newspaper; individual small questions are answered in the inquiry book or in person. In February alone, the main center answered 49 questions, including 11 policy questions and 9 worker occupation questions. In addition to answering by letter, more than 10 were answered on the blackboard newspaper. In addition, 41 cases of mass disputes were handled and questions answered in person. The blackboard newspaper is published daily, with the main center having published more than 80 issues and the three branch centers having published 30 to 60 issues. Each issue has a publicity focus. When publishing news of the Kuomintang reactionaries' playing with fake peace conspiracies, cartoons were also produced, which were very popular with the masses, and many people crowded to see them every day. In the exhibition department, there are 234 kinds of photos and 34 kinds of cartoons on production, combat, land reform, worker protection of factories, and resumption of work, which are exhibited in rotation in various centers, changing every week. The reading department has more than 500 kinds of books and magazines, more than 1,500 volumes, and 24 kinds of newspapers. On average, more than 1,000 people read books, newspapers, and photos every day. At first, more people read newspapers, photos, and picture books, but now more people read books. During the Lantern Festival, the main center held art performances and current affairs lectures, and a lantern riddle fair at night. Thousands of people entered and exited the main center that day, and the first branch also held a lantern riddle party.

    In order to improve the cultural and political level of workers, shop assistants, and the poor, a people's night school was established on the 15th of last month. The number of students has increased from 30 or 40 to more than 100. Most of them are workers, out-of-school students, illiterate children, and small businessmen. It is stipulated that they study for two hours every night. According to their cultural level, they are divided into three major groups, and each group is divided into several subgroups, using the complex teaching method. The content of the study is determined according to the requirements of the students and must be discussed in advance by the group. The main courses are cultural courses and political courses. The students have a high enthusiasm for learning and arrive very early every day. Some workers do not rest on Sundays and go to study, and some ask for more study time. An 18-year-old girl was beaten by her parents for asking to study. After the explanation of the cadres of the People's Education Center, she finally came to school. In the past half month, each student has had a preliminary understanding of the Communist Party and land policy, industrial and commercial policy, and the Kuomintang's conspiracy to play with fake peace. Those who are illiterate have also learned 50 or 60 new characters, and the most have learned 100 new characters. In arithmetic class, some have learned three-digit multiplication and division.

    The center is now actively establishing a library. In the future, it also plans to: further enrich the exhibition room, buy more books, add game rooms, expand the people's night school, hold weekly lectures, and extend the work to the masses outside the center.

　　门庭若市
    张家口民教馆介绍
    杨兴华
    一月初，张家口市民众教育馆总馆及分馆三处先后成立。两个多月来，社会服务部解答了许多群众的疑难问题。凡属带有普遍性的问题，即向蔡哈尔日报社投稿解答；范围较小带有指导意义的问题，在黑板报上解答；个别小问题在问事簿上或当面解答。在二月份，仅总馆即解答了四十九件，其中有政策问题十一件，工人职业问题九件，除用信件答覆外，在黑板报上答覆了十余件。另外当面处理群众纠纷解答问题四十一件。黑板报每天出一期，总馆已出了八十多期，三个分馆也出了三十至六十期。每期有一个宣传中心，当刊登国民党反动派玩弄假和平阴谋消息时，还配合出了漫画，很受群众欢迎，每天有很多人拥挤着看。在展览部里，有生产、战斗、土地改革、工人保护工厂和复工等照片二百三十四种，漫画三十四种，各馆轮流展览，每周一换。阅览部则备有图书、杂志五百多种，一千五百多册，报纸二十四种。平均每日阅览书报及照片的有一千多人。起初看报纸、照片、画报的多，现在看书的人较多了。在元宵节，总馆举办过艺曲演唱及时事讲述，夜间举办灯迷游艺会，是日出入总馆的达数千人，第一分馆也举办了一次灯迷晚会。
    为了提高工人、店员、贫民的文化及政治水平，于上月十五日成立了民众夜校一处，学员已由三、四十名增到一百来名，大多数是工人、失学学生、文盲儿童、小商人等。规定每晚学习两小时，根据文化程度分成了三大组，每组又分成若干小组，采取复式教学方法。学习内容是根据学员的要求而定，事先都要经过小组的讨论，主要课程是文化课、政治课。学员学习情绪很高，每天到的很早，有的工人在星期日不休息，也去学习，有的要求增加学习时间，有一个十八岁的姑娘，因为要求学习，曾挨过父母的打，经过民教馆干部的解释，终于到校了。半月来，每个学员对共产党和土地政策、工商业政策、国民党玩弄假和平阴谋等问题，已有了初步认识。不识字的人，也认到五、六十个生字，最多的达一百个生字。算术课有的已学到三位乘除法。
    该馆现正积极设立图书馆。今后并计划：进一步充实展鉴室，多买书，增添游艺室，扩大民众夜校，办星期讲座，把工作伸展到馆外群众中去。
