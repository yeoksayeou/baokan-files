Ping City Launches Sanitation Campaign
    Ping Police Force Allocates Large Number of Trucks to Transport Garbage
    [Report from this newspaper] The city's cleaning campaign is actively underway. Since the beginning of this movement on the 8th of this month, up to the 22nd, nine districts in the city have established cleaning campaign committee district branches and street cleaning teams. The People's Liberation Army's 41st Army, garrisoning Beiping, and units such as the Garrison Command, have allocated a large number of trucks for transporting garbage. At the district chiefs' meeting held by the Municipal Government on the afternoon of the 22nd, Comrade Ye Jianying gave an impromptu speech, explaining that the cleaning campaign is for the health and hygiene of all citizens and is completely different from the Kuomintang reactionaries' efforts to tidy up the city's appearance for the sake of showing it to the imperialists. The People's Government must actively lead this movement, mobilize the masses, educate the masses, and build and consolidate the people's political power. 　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　(Qi)

　　平市卫生运动开展
    平警部队拨出大批卡车运垃圾
    【本报讯】本市清洁运动正积极进行中。这一运动自本月八日开始，迄二十二日，全市已有九个区成立清洁运动委员会区分会和街巷清运小组。警备北平的人民解放军第四十一军与警备司令部等单位，并拨出大批卡车供给运输垃圾之用。市政府于二十二日下午召开的区长会议上，叶剑英同志曾即席讲话，说明清洁运动是为着全市市民的健康和卫生，和国民党反动派为了给帝国主义看而整饬市容完全不同。人民政府要积极领导这个运动，发动群众、教育群众，建设和巩固人民的政权。 　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　（琪）
