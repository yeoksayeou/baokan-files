　　Water Conservancy Construction Increases Grain Production
　　Northeast Expands Paddy Fields by Over 80,000 Hectares
　　[Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 27th] The Northeast Administrative Committee plans to sow 300,000 hectares of paddy fields in the Northeast Liberated Areas this spring (one hectare equals ten mu), which means restoring and newly cultivating 88,487 hectares, as the Northeast only had 211,513 hectares of paddy fields last year. To realize this plan, each province is massively developing small-scale mass-based paddy fields, restoring those that are easy to restore first, and extensively adopting cooperative management with the masses for water conservancy projects that require little investment but yield high profits. For water conservancy projects restored and constructed by the state and local governments, a water conservancy fee of 35 percent of the output will be collected annually. According to reports from various provinces, Jilin had already increased its paddy fields by 11,000 hectares by the beginning of this month. Heilongjiang Province mainly focuses on building dams to irrigate paddy fields, which can increase planting by 7,000 hectares. It is estimated that the entire Northeast can increase grain production by 149,000 tons this year as a result.

　　兴修水利增产粮食
    东北增辟水田八万余顷
    【新华社沈阳二十七日电】东北行政委员会计划今春在东北解放区播种水田三十万顷（一顷十亩），即恢复和增辟八万八千四百八十七顷，因东北去年水田只二十一万一千五百十三顷。各省为实现这一计划，均大量发展群众性的小型水田，将容易恢复的先行恢复，对投资少获利多的水利工程，大量采取与群众合作经营，其由国家及地方政府恢复与修建的水利工程，确定每年按产量收百分之三十五的水利费。现据各省报告，吉林在本月上旬已增开水田一万一千顷。合江省主要是修筑水坝、灌溉水田，可增种七千顷。全东北预计今年可由此而增产粮食十四万九千吨。
