Yuci Fufengxiang Colludes with Private Merchants to Defraud National Bank Loans
    [Jinzhong Telegram] The Yuci City Fufengxiang state-owned store colluded with private merchants to defraud national bank loans, seriously damaging the interests of the state and the people. The Pingyao Huafeng Goods Depot (state-owned) opened a branch counter in Yuci last November called Fufengxiang Goods Shop, appointing Chen Jinggang, a private merchant from Shijiazhuang, as manager. In the same month, it split off a portion of its capital to jointly operate with private merchant Shao Fengbin, opening Fufeng Store, with Shao Fengbin as manager. Xiao Shoucai, manager of Huafeng Goods Depot, personally led Chen Jinggang, manager of its branch counter Fufengxiang, to the Yuci branch of the People's Bank last year to apply for a loan. Then, Fufeng Store acted as guarantor for a further loan of 100,000 yuan (People's Currency). The two business firms borrowed, deposited, withdrew, and overspent a total of more than 250,000 yuan at the branch. Of this, apart from Xiao Shoucai remitting over 20,000 yuan back from Pingyao Huafeng Goods Depot to repay the loan, over 230,000 yuan, including principal and interest, is still owed to the branch. According to a reporter's investigation, Xiao Shoucai used overdrafts from the bank to remit funds to its branch counter Fuhexing in Shijiazhuang, and Fuhexing was supposed to send goods to the Yuci branch counter. However, the manager of that store, An (a private merchant hired for the role), using the alias Zhang Qingfeng, defrauded the Shijiazhuang branch of the People's Bank of 50,000 yuan and absconded with the remitted funds of over 100,000 yuan. The Yuci branch, due to the long delay in repayment of this loan, urged them to pay it back. However, Xiao Shoucai not only failed to find a way to repay, but also ordered Chen Jinggang to flee, and instructed Shao Fengbin to find ways to deny the debt. Subsequently, Xiao Shoucai not only transported all the goods from the Yuci branch counter Fufengxiang Goods Shop to Pingyao, but also declared to the Yuci branch that the Yuci Fufengxiang Goods Shop had no economic relationship with the Pingyao Huafeng Goods Depot, telling the branch to pursue Chen Jinggang for the debt. To protect the state bank's capital, the branch temporarily seized a portion of the goods from Fufeng Store, which had acted as collateral for the loan, as security. Fufeng Store was ordered to find collateral for the 50,000 yuan it had borrowed from the branch, according to the law. Jianming Store, for which Shao Fengbin of Fufeng Store had acted as guarantor, was also ordered to immediately repay the 60,000 yuan it had borrowed from the branch.

　　榆次福丰祥勾结私商
    骗取国家银行贷款
    【晋中电】榆次市福丰祥公营商店与私商合谋骗取国家银行贷款，严重地损害了国家与人民的利益。平遥华丰货栈（公营），于去年十一月，在榆次开设支柜福丰祥货庄，任用石家庄私商陈景岗为经理，同月又分出一部资本与私商邵风彬合营，再开设福丰商店，邵风彬为经理。华丰货栈经理萧守财，去年曾亲领其支柜福丰祥经理陈景岗至人民银行榆次支行贷款后，又由福丰商店作保再贷去十万元（人民票，下同），该两商号前后在支行贷款与存放提取透支，共达二十五万余元，其中除萧守财由平遥华丰货栈汇归贷款二万余元外，现连同本息尚拖欠支行二十三万余元。据记者调查，萧守财曾以向银行透支款项汇至石家庄其支柜福和祥，由福和祥向榆次支柜发货，不料该号经理安某（任用的私商），竟以化名张庆丰向石家庄人民银行分行骗去贷款五万元，与汇去的十余万元席卷而逃。榆次支行因是项贷款拖延甚久，催其付选，但萧守财不仅未设法归还，反令陈景岗逃去，并令邵风彬设法抵赖。嗣后，萧守财除将榆次支柜福丰祥货庄全部货物运往平遥外，并对榆次支行声明榆次福丰祥货庄与平遥华丰货栈无任何经济关系，让支行向陈景岗追索欠款。支行为保护国家银行资本，便将是项贷款之铺保福丰商店一部货物暂时扣留，作为抵押。福丰商店向支行所贷之五万元，依法令其寻觅铺保。由福丰商店邵风彬作保的建明商店向支行所贷的六万元，也令其立即归还。
