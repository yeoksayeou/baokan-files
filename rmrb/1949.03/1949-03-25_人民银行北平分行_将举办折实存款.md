　　People's Bank of Beiping Branch
    To Launch "Real Value" Deposits
    [This Newspaper's Report] To promote thrift and reward savings among all sectors of society, the People's Bank of Beiping Branch has established a savings department and will offer "real value" deposits. The savings department will be located at the old site of the Cooperative Warehouse on Donghuamen Street and is scheduled to open on April 1st. The "real value" deposit types include lump-sum deposit with lump-sum withdrawal, deposit principal with interest payments, installment savings with lump-sum withdrawal, and lump-sum deposit with installment withdrawals. A "standard commodity unit" will be used as the calculation standard. The "standard commodity unit" is the total price of three items: wheat flour (one jin), corn flour (one jin), and Wufu cloth (one chi). Whether depositing or withdrawing, savings account holders will use this calculation, which will not be affected by rising prices. After this deposit type is launched, the bank will formulate the "standard commodity unit" daily based on the city's commodity prices. (Yu)
