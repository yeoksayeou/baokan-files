　　Tianjin's Agencies and Schools
    Promote Thrift and Eliminate Waste
    [Tianjin Electric] Various agencies and schools in Tianjin are vigorously promoting thrift and curbing certain wasteful phenomena. The People's Government has established various systems to prevent waste. The Tianjin Office of the Preparatory Committee of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions also held a meeting of all cadres to strictly criticize the individual cadres' enjoyment mentality and waste of electricity. The Military Control Commission's Department of Culture and Education notified all public schools to tighten their budgets, and to make the most of waste paper and old materials for all office supplies, paper, and forms. The use of water, electricity, and coal should also be strictly managed. Nanyang University has responded to this call by automatically reducing more than two hundred workers to just over one hundred and fifty. The school's school affairs committee also decided to cancel the top and bottom margins of letter paper, and to print eight-line paper into through-top-to-bottom ten-line paper. Unnecessary blank spaces in official documents will be eliminated. The salary bags previously used for salary distribution will also be discontinued. Tianjin Daily and Xinhua News Agency's Tianjin branch have also formulated various thrift regulations, such as prohibiting the use of electric stoves; limiting the intensity of dormitory lights; and making the most of old envelopes except where necessary.

　　天津各机关学校
    推行节约肃清浪费
    【天津电】天津市各机关学校正大力提倡节约，制止某些浪费现象。人民市政府已订立各种制度，防止发生浪费。华北总工会筹委会天津办事处亦召开全体干部会议，对个别干部的享受思想及浪费电力等现象，进行了严格批评。军管会文教部通知各公立学校，紧缩开支，一切办公用具纸张表册，尽量利用废纸旧物。水电煤炭之使用也应严加管理。北洋大学已响应此一号召，自动将二百余工友缩减为一百五十余。该校校务委员会并决定取消信纸的天地头，将八行纸印成通上通下的十行纸。将公文中不必要的空白取消。以前发薪时所用的薪水袋，也不用了。天津日报与新华社天津分社也制订节约的种种规定，例如不准使用电炉；宿舍灯光限制一定度数；除必要情形外，尽量利用旧信封。
