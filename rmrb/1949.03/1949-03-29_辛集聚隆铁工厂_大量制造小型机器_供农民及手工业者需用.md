Xinji Julong Iron Factory
　　Mass Produces Small Machines
　　For Farmers and Handicraft Workers Needs

　　[Our Report] The Julong Iron Factory, directly under the Jizhong Industrial Company, is mass-producing agricultural implements and handicraft tools to supply the needs of farmers and handicraft workers. In the past six months, it has produced 89 waterwheels, 18 sets of bellows, 25 threshing machines, 331 spinning wheels, and more than 30 kinds of small handicraft machines such as soap making machines, nail hammering machines, towel machines, and leather turning machines. All of these have been sold to meet the needs of farmers and handicraft workers. It has also repaired thousands of pieces of agricultural implements and factory equipment. The factory has also established contact with more than a dozen iron furnaces in the vicinity to customize semi-finished products (such as leather spindles) for them, so that small-scale handicraft industry can be developed. In addition, the factory purchased a large amount of scrap iron from the countryside as raw materials. In Fangbei Village alone, sixteen or seventeen peddlers often sell iron during their spare time from production. Currently, each jin of pig iron can earn 5 RMB, and each jin of wrought iron can earn 20 RMB. Yang Luozheng from the village once delivered 134 jin of wrought iron. In order to meet the needs of future water conservancy construction and large-scale cotton planting, the factory plans to manufacture more waterwheels and cotton gins. In terms of business operations, it is determined to further establish close contact with supply and marketing cooperatives and production promotion societies. The factory was established in 1945, transformed from a small repair shop during the Anti-Japanese War to serve the rural areas. It has a total of 70 workers and is the largest factory in Xinji City.
