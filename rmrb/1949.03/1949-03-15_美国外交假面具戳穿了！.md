　　The False Mask of American Diplomacy Torn Off!
　　A year ago, Ms. Buckle, head of the press office at the U.S. Embassy in the Soviet Union, wrote a letter to U.S. Ambassador to the Soviet Union Smith, resigning her post and declaring her willingness to remain in the Soviet Union. In the past year, she wrote a book, "The True Face of American Diplomats," exposing everything she witnessed during her time working in the U.S. domestic intelligence agency and later at the U.S. Embassy in Moscow.
　　This book exposes the true face of the new war instigators with firsthand facts.
　　American Spies Infiltrate the Soviet Union Under Various Guises
　　Buckle wrote: "Based on various observations, I am qualified to state definitively that the heads of American intelligence agencies, taking advantage of the alliance between the United States and the Soviet Union during World War II, dispatched professional spies to the Soviet Union to carry out work against this allied country. These spies were sent to the Soviet Union in all sorts of disguises, acting as embassy consultants, second and third secretaries, counselors, or junior staff, as quartermasters and military attachés of the military mission, or as reporters for American newspapers, magazines, and broadcasting companies, or as experts helping to install various equipment shipped to the Soviet Union under the Lend-Lease Act." Buckle emphasized: "The Strategic Services Unit (note: referring to the intelligence agency established by the United States during the war) has attached particular importance to developing anti-Soviet espionage activities since it first began operations. As the war neared its end, the Strategic Services Unit concentrated on finding ways to obtain secret intelligence about the Soviet Union's foreign policy and the democratic countries that had established friendly treaties with the Soviet Union…"
　　American Anti-Soviet Clique Conspires to Provoke Anti-Soviet War
　　The anti-Soviet activities of the American intelligence agencies are completely consistent with the activities of those officials in the American diplomatic organs who handle U.S.-Soviet relations. Buckle stated: U.S.-Soviet relations are monopolized by a small group of leading diplomatic officials, they (belonging to the extreme anti-Soviet wing of the American diplomatic organs and striving to provoke an anti-Soviet war) this small group tightly controls all U.S.-Soviet relations and formulates the State Department's policy towards the Soviet Union. This small group is the instigator of all anti-Soviet conspiracies and the constant encouragement of base slanders and defamations against the Soviet Union, causing such slanders and defamations to constantly appear in the United States. The behind-the-scenes wire-pullers of this small group of anti-Soviet experts from the State Department are the Wall Street monopoly capitalists.
　　Buckle listed the names of the members of this anti-Soviet clique, described the life of each of them, and listed many facts to show their attempts to worsen Soviet-American relations. A key member of the group is Loy Henderson. After the establishment of U.S.-Soviet diplomatic relations, he had himself appointed as ambassador to the Soviet Union. All the staff of the U.S. Embassy in the Soviet Union were, in fact, handpicked by him. He "used every possible means to carry out anti-Soviet activities." George Kennan (note: Kennan is currently the Chairman of the Policy Planning Committee of the U.S. State Department), who served as Counselor of the U.S. Embassy in the Soviet Union in the anti-Soviet group of the American diplomatic organs, was Henderson's most trusted assistant. He came to Moscow for the third time in 1944. This "Counselor," with the strong support of U.S. Ambassador to the Soviet Union Harriman, cabled the U.S. State Department day and night, deliberately slandering and distorting Soviet foreign policy.
　　This is the characteristic of that reactionary group in the American diplomatic organs, which monopolizes affairs between the Soviet Union and the United States. Their purpose in handling these affairs is to benefit their masters—the monopoly capitalists, to benefit themselves, and to harm the interests of the American people and the cause of world peace.
　　U.S. Embassy in the Soviet Union Manufactures Anti-Soviet Libel
　　Buckle wrote: "While at the Embassy, I learned that I was continuing the same work I had previously served in the same intelligence agency domestically. The only difference was that I used to work in an agency that received comprehensive or classified intelligence from abroad, and now I was on the front line, in an organization that obtained Soviet intelligence."
　　Buckle pointed out: The current U.S. Ambassador to the Soviet Union, General Smith, is a professional intelligence officer. She said: "The State Department needs to appoint experienced spies as ambassadors to give 'professional diplomats' the necessary instructions and appropriate leadership in anti-Soviet espionage activities." The book cites facts to illustrate that one of the most despicable aspects of the various activities of the U.S. Embassy in the Soviet Union is the fabrication of anti-Soviet libel and its supply to American reactionaries. Buckle declared: I personally know that the embassy received coded telegrams from the Secretary of State or the Undersecretary of State several times, instructing them to collect distorted information to supply American newspapers or radio stations for widespread anti-Soviet propaganda. Buckle wrote, referring to the activities of various staff members of the U.S. Embassy in the Soviet Union: Among the heads of the embassy, one of the most colorful figures was the embassy's Counselor Durbrow. Thanks to his efforts, a real "iron curtain" has been erected between the embassy staff and Soviet life. Buckle pointed out: Durbrow is the author of the most important telegrams and reports sent to the State Department, and he only "sends defamatory information that conforms to his policy." Not only that, Buckle said: Any anti-Soviet rumor, or any fact that can be distorted in an anti-Soviet spirit, makes him as happy as a child getting a new toy.
　　Buckle wrote: "Another noteworthy figure in the U.S. Embassy is Reinhardt, the embassy's secretary. He is also the head of the U.S. Embassy's press office, and he collects news published in Soviet newspapers and forwards it to Washington. Reinhardt often focuses on collecting events related to Soviet policies and political life, providing considerable explanations and extreme distortions to slander the Soviet Union."

### 美国外交假面具戳穿了！

　　美国外交假面具戳穿了！
    一年以前，美国驻苏大使馆新闻处长布克尔女士，写信给美驻苏大使史密斯提出辞职，并声明她愿意留居苏联。在这一年当中，她写了一本“美国外交人员的真面目”，揭露她从前在美国国内谍报机关以及后来到莫斯科美国大使馆工作期间所目睹的一切。
    这本书以亲身看见的事实揭露了新战争挑拨者的真面目。
    美国间谍在各种伪装下混入苏联
    布克尔写道：“根据各种观察，我有资格确定地断言：美国谍报机关的首领，利用了第二次世界大战期间美苏两国的同盟关系，派遣职业间谍到苏联，进行反对这一同盟国家的工作。这些间谍是以各式各样的伪装派往苏联的，他们充当大使馆的顾问，二等及三等秘书参赞或小职员，充当军事使团的军需及大使馆的武官，或者充当美国报纸、杂志与广播公司的访员或者充当帮助装置按租借法运往苏联各种装备的专家。”布克尔强调称：“战略服务处（按系美国在战时所成立的谍报机关）从它刚刚开始活动的时候起，便特别重视发展反苏的间谍活动。到大战快结束的时候，战略服务处即集中注意于设法获得关于苏联的外交政策，以及与苏联订立友好条约的各民主国家的秘密情报…。”
    美国反苏小集团阴谋挑起反苏战争
    美国谍报机关的反苏活动，和美国外交机关处理美苏关系的那一批官员的活动，是完全一致的。布克尔称：美苏关系是由首要外交官员的小集团垄断着，他们（属于美国外交机关极端反苏的一翼，而且力图挑拨反苏战争）这一小集团把一切美苏关系紧紧地掌握在自己的手中，并制订了国务院所遵循的对苏政策。这一小集团是一切反苏阴谋和不断对苏进行卑鄙的污蔑与诽谤的鼓励者，使这种污蔑与诽谤不断地在美国出现。这个来自国务院的反苏专家小集团的幕后牵线人，是华尔街的垄断资本家。
    布克尔列举了这一反苏小集团的成员的名字，描述他们每一个人的生平，并列举了许多事实，说明他们企图使苏美关系恶化。该集团的要员是劳伊·亨德逊。在美苏外交关系建立之后，他便使他自己被任命为驻苏大使。美驻苏大使馆的一切职员，实际上都是他物色的。他“利用一切可能进行反苏活动”。在美国外交机关反苏集团中充当美驻苏大使馆参事的乔治·凯南（按：凯南现任美国国务院政策计划委员会主席），是亨德逊最心腹的助手。他于一九四四年第三次来到莫斯科。这位“参事”在获得美驻苏大使哈里曼的有力支持之后，便日以继夜地向美国国务院拍电，故意地诽谤与歪曲苏联的外交政策。
    这就是美国外交机关那个反动集团的特性，该集团垄断了苏美之间的事务，他们处理这些事务的目的，是要有利于他们的主子——垄断资本家，有利于他们自己，而损害美国人民的利益，损害全世界和平的事业。
    美国驻苏大使馆制造反苏诽谤
    布克尔写道：“在大使馆的时候，我了解到我正继续着从前在国内所服务的那同一谍报机关中的工作。所不同的仅是我以前是在那个从国外接受综合情报或分类情报的机关中工作，而现在，我是身临前线，是来到了获取苏联情报的组织中。”
    布克尔指出：现在美驻苏大使史密斯将军是职业谍报官。她说：“国务院需要任命经验丰富的特务充当大使，以便在反苏间谍活动中，给‘职业外交官’必要的指示与适当的领导。”该书举出事实，说明美驻苏大使馆各种活动中最丑恶的方面之一，便是制造反苏诽谤并以之供给美国反动派。布克尔宣称：我本人知道大使馆好几次收到国务卿或副国务卿拍来的密码电报，训令搜集歪曲的情报，供给美国报纸或广播电台，以便进行广泛的反苏宣传。布克尔在说到美驻苏大使馆各个职员的活动时写道：在大使馆的首脑当中，最富于色彩的人物之一，是大使馆的参事杜尔布劳。由于他的卖力，在大使馆职员与苏联生活之间，已经树立起了真正的“铁幕”。布克尔指出：杜尔布劳是拍往国务院的最重要电报与报告的撰稿人，他仅只“拍发同他的政策相符合的污蔑性的情报”，不仅如此，布克尔说：任何反苏的流言，或任何可以用反苏的精神加以歪曲的事实，都使他象小孩子获得一个新的玩具一样高兴。
    布克尔写道：“美国大使馆另一个值得注意的人物，是大使馆的秘书莱恩哈特。他同时也是美国大使馆的新闻处处长，他将苏联报纸所发表的新闻搜集起来，转发给华盛顿。莱恩哈特经常集中精力搜集一些有关苏联的政策和政治生活的事件，加以相当的解释加以极度的歪曲来诽谤苏联。（待续）
