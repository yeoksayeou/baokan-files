Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 5th. The "Decision on Further Reducing the Prices of Consumer Goods in State-Run Retail Trade from March 1st" promulgated by the Soviet Council of Ministers and the Central Committee of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) spread rapidly to every corner of the Soviet Union on the evening of February 28th, arousing cheers from all the working people of the Soviet Union. They greeted this decision with a deep sense of honor for their Soviet motherland.

According to TASS: Moscow newspapers on the 1st all published accounts of rallies held throughout the Soviet Union. The newspapers all used banner headlines stating: "The people of all nationalities in the Soviet Union believe that the new reduction in consumer goods prices is a manifestation of Stalin's concern for further improving the welfare of the working people." "The Soviet people are deeply grateful to the Party, the government, and the great Stalin for caring for the working people's better times like parents."

Every workshop in the Stalin Automobile Factory in Moscow held a rally on the night of February 28th. Foreman Litovchenko of the lathe workshop said: We welcome the decision of the Party and the government with heartfelt gratitude. We have taken another big step on the road to increasing the purchasing power of the Soviet ruble and real wages.

The entire city of Leningrad was also filled with joy on the night of the 28th. Stakhanovite worker Shutova of the Kirov Textile Factory said at the rally: After the first price reduction, I already felt that life was better. Now, I feel it is even better.

In the Karelo-Finnish Republic, enthusiastic rallies were also held everywhere. All the personnel in the assembly workshop of the oldest automobile factory in Karelia pledged to intensify the production of trucks for the timber industry, guaranteeing that the production speed will be half again as fast as the planned speed, to respond to the concern of the Party and the government. At the same time, many loggers also joyfully announced that March would be Stakhanovite Month.

In the countryside, collective farms also warmly welcomed the new price reduction. He Fovski-kov, chairman of the Kalacheyev Collective Farm in the Voronezh Oblast, said: Thanks to the currency reform, we collective farmers have already received many benefits. The cost of purchasing industrial products has been reduced, and our income and actual earnings have increased. We are grateful to the Party and the government for this new concern, and we will do everything possible to supply the country with more bread, meat, and butter. Our collective farm is striving to harvest 120 poods of grain per hectare (approximately 16 mu per hectare), and we will achieve this goal.

Intellectuals across the country also gathered to welcome the decision and express their gratitude to the Party, the government, and Stalin.

The working people of Kiev, Minsk, Kuibyshev, Gorky, Stalino, and hundreds of other large and small towns in the Soviet Union warmly welcomed this decision.
