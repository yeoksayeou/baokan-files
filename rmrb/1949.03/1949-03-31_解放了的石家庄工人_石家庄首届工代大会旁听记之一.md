The Liberated Workers of Shijiazhuang
    ——Notes from Observing the First Workers' Congress of Shijiazhuang (Part 1)
    By Our Reporter Tian Liu
    Before liberation, the workers of Shijiazhuang were constantly plagued by hunger and persecution. They were called "dirty workers" and "stinky workers." A month ago, when I interviewed at the Railway Factory, a worker told me: before liberation, machines and workers were tools of the capitalists. Machines were dead tools, and workers were "living tools." At that time, workers only had one opportunity to enter the government offices, and that was when they were arrested and brought to court to be tortured and thrown into prison. Now, not only does no one call them "dirty workers" or "stinky workers" anymore, but people have also come to understand that only by relying on the proletariat can we build the people's city and industry. Mayor Ke Qingshi often holds symposiums with workers to solicit their opinions and criticisms of the government's various tasks. When workers have any difficult problems, they naturally feel at home, sitting with the mayor in the government office, drinking tea and talking. Last summer, the workers of Shijiazhuang elected their representatives to participate in the North China People's Representative Conference, and Ling Biying—an old worker with decades of experience—was elected as a member of the North China People's Government. Chen Meisheng, a veteran worker of the "February 7th" strike from the Railway Factory, became the head of the Fourth District of the city. Currently, 114 workers in the city are participating in the leadership of district and street governments. In public factories, workers have become the masters of the enterprise and participate in factory management, some having been promoted to factory directors, section chiefs, or participating in other administrative leadership roles. Wang Jingzhai, the former engineer of the Railway Factory, was promoted to factory director last winter, and recently was promoted to acting director of the Mechanical Affairs Department. According to statistics from the first Workers' Congress, 181 workers have participated in factory administrative leadership, and 183 workers have participated in the takeover work in Tianjin and Beijing.
    Regarding the issue of wages, egalitarianism was a problem in the early days of liberation, but it was quickly corrected. Thanks to the increasing development of production over the past year, wages were adjusted comprehensively at the beginning of this year. The minimum wage for ordinary workers can generally maintain the livelihood of a family of two. More work, more pay; higher skills, higher wages. At the same time, to ensure that wages can buy actual goods and are not affected by price fluctuations or intermediate exploitation, public factories, with the strong help of the administration and the active participation of workers, have established their own cooperatives. According to statistics from five public enterprises, including the Railway Da Xing Factory, the factory administrations contributed a total of 5 million RMB to help establish cooperatives. Workers and their families can buy 20 jin of millet and 10 jin of white flour per month at prices generally 20% to 30% lower than the market price. Da Xing Textile Mill alone sells more than 300,000 jin of grain at low prices each month. The Telephone Bureau Employees' Cooperative has saved its employees more than 10,000 jin of millet in the past three months due to its low prices of grain and daily necessities. In February, the cooperatives of various public factories jointly decided to unite all the employee cooperatives under the leadership of the Municipal Supply and Marketing Cooperative to improve the lives of workers better than before. In private factories, the wages, working hours, and welfare of workers have also been initially resolved through the reasonable struggles of united workers. Working hours generally do not exceed twelve hours, and ironworkers have begun to have holidays.
    When the political rights and economic lives of workers are reasonably guaranteed and improved, and when workers become aware that they are the leading class and masters of the country, they urgently demand the improvement of their cultural and political levels. They want to acquire sufficient knowledge and ability to realize their leading role and master's responsibility in the people's country and the people's industry. More than 2,000 workers participate in the weekly lectures organized by the Municipal Trade Union, and workers scramble to read the "Workers' Small Newspaper." More than 2,900 workers are studying in workers' training classes, and 340 outstanding workers have been recommended to the North China Workers' School for advanced studies. Larger public factories have their own clubs, which contain various books, newspapers, and entertainment supplies. Worker Yangko teams, worker theatrical troupes, etc., exist in almost every factory. The famous "Red Flag Song" and "Oppose the Three Hands" are collectively created and performed by the workers of the Da Xing Textile Mill. The "Technology Research Association" established by the Railway Machinery Factory has more than 100 employees participating, and they mutually study and pass on technology during their noon breaks. The Da Xing Textile Mill has established a class-based learning system, with each worker having one hour of cultural or political study each day. The learning of the Telephone Bureau employees is even more enthusiastic. They are divided into three study groups according to their different levels, learning politics, culture, electromagnetism, wired telegraphy, and other courses. Not only are there no phenomena of lateness, early departure, or lack of attention in learning, but even during breaks or games, you can find employees discussing issues or hiding in corners engrossed in reading. Moreover, the enthusiasm of the employees for learning has also infected their families. Every morning, you can see groups of women walking towards the Telephone Bureau, these are the family members of the Telephone Bureau employees coming to participate in cultural learning. In early March, the Third District Trade Union held an evening supplementary school for private industry employees, with more than 100 workers participating. Since then, the learning problems of private factory workers have also been initially resolved.
    In the year since liberation, all the workers of Shijiazhuang have not only rebuilt and restored the people's industry on the ruins, but also waged unremitting struggles against some undesirable tendencies. During the group discussions on the 19th and 20th, many representatives pointed out that a few administrative leaders of factories simply emphasize administrative management and fail to mobilize the enthusiasm of the workers. The democratization of factory management is not done well enough. Some factories, although they have established factory management committees, they do not play a role. The representatives particularly criticized bureaucratic styles. The representative of the Coking Plant No. 1 Branch heatedly and sharply criticized their Secretary Guo for not caring about the workers' lives and welfare, looking down on the workers, saying that "workers are not worthy of talking about democracy at all," privately suppressing the opinions raised by the workers, etc. The representatives unanimously pointed out that this harmful bureaucracy must be corrected immediately. The representative assembly has sent representatives to the Coking Plant No. 1 Branch and other factories that have been criticized to conduct investigations in order to resolve the issues.
    "We know how to take on our responsibilities as masters," one representative said confidently during the adjournment.

　　解放了的石家庄工人
    ——石家庄首届工代大会旁听记之一
    本报记者  田流
    解放前，石家庄的工人，饥饿和迫害没有一天离开过他们，他们被叫作“脏工人”、“臭工人”。一月前，我采访铁路大厂时，一个工人告诉我：解放前机器和工人都是资本家的工具，机器是死工具，工人是“活工具”。那时，工人们只有一个机会才能走入官府的大门，那就是被抓进法庭上拷打和被丢进监牢的时候。现在，不但没有人骂“脏工人”、“臭工人”了，而且人们都已懂得，只有依靠无产阶级，才能建设人民的城市和工业。柯庆施市长经常召开职工座谈会，征求工人们对政府各种工作的意见和批评。工人们有了什么疑难问题，象回到自己家里那样自然，和市长坐在政府的办公室里，一面喝茶一面谈。去年夏天，石家庄的职工选派了自己的代表，参加华北人民代表会议，而凌必应——这位作工数十年的老工友被选为华北人民政府的委员，铁路大厂“二七”老工友陈梅生当了本市四区区长，现在全市已有一百一十四个工人参加了区街政权的领导工作。在公营工厂里，工人已经成为企业的主人而参加了工厂管理，有的升任了厂长，有的升任了科长或参加了其他行政领导工作。铁路大厂原工程师王静斋去冬升任了厂长，不久前又升任了机务处的代理处长，据首届职工代表大会的统计，已经有一百八十一个工人参加了工厂行政领导工作，一百八十三个工人参加了平津的接管工作。
    工资问题，在解放初期，曾犯过平均主义的毛病，但很快就纠正了。由于一年来生产的日益发展。今年初又全面地调整了一次工资，普通工人的最低工资，一般能维持两口人的生活。多劳多酬，技术高的工资高。同时，为保证工资能买到实物，不受物价的影响和中间剥削，各公营工厂，在行政上的大力帮助和工人积极参加下，都建立了自己的合作社。据铁路大兴等五个公营企业的统计，工厂行政上共拿出了五百万元人民币帮助成立合作社，职工们和他的家属，每人每月能买到二十斤小米和十斤白面，价格一般的低于市价百分之二十至三十。仅大兴纱厂每月就低价售出三十万斤以上的粮食。电话局职工合作社，最近三个月售出的粮食和日用品，由于价格低廉，职工们省下了一万多斤小米。二月间，各公营工厂合作社，共同决定，将所有的职工合作社联合起来，在市供销总社的领导下，统一的比过去更好的改善工人生活。在私营工厂里，职工的工资工时和福利，也在工人团结起来合理争取下，得到了初步解决，工时一般的不超过十二小时，铁业工人已开始有了休假日。
    当职工们的政治权利与经济生活得到合理的保障与改善，当工人自觉到自己是国家的领导阶级和主人的时候，他们迫切要求文化政治水平的提高，他们要获得足够的知识和能力，来实现自己在人民的国家和人民的工业中的领导作用和主人翁的职责。市职工会举办的星期讲座有二千多工人参加，“职工小报”被工人们争夺着阅读，有二千九百余工人到工人训练班学习，有三百四十个优秀的工人，被保送到华北职工学校去深造。较大的公营工厂都组织有自己的俱乐部，里面放着各种书报和娱乐用品，工人秧歌队、工人剧团等差不多每厂都有。有名的“红旗歌”“反对三只手”就是大兴纱厂职工的集体创作、集体演出的。铁路机厂建立的“技术研究会”有一百多职工参加，每日中午休息时间，互相研究传习技术。大兴纱厂建立分班学习制，每个工人每天有一小时的文化或政治学习。电话局职工的学习更加热烈，他们根据不同的程度分成三个学习小组，学习政治、文化、电磁学、有线电报等课，不仅没有迟到早退或不用心学习的现象，就是在下工休息或游戏的时候，也到处可以碰到职工们讨论问题或自己躲在角落里聚精会神的读书。并且，职工们学习的热情，也感染到他们的家属，每天清早，就可以看到三五成群的妇女走向电话局，这是电话局职工的家属们来参加文化学习的。三区工会在三月初举办私营行业职工的业余补习夜校，已有百多工人参加，自此，私营工厂工人的学习问题，也获得初步解决了。
    解放一年来，石家庄全体职工不仅在废墟上重新建立与恢复起人民的工业，而且对于一些不良倾向也作了不懈的斗争。代表们在十九、二十两天的小组大会讨论中，许多代表指出，有少数的工厂的行政领导干部单纯的强调行政管理，不去发动工人的积极性，工厂管理民主化还作得不够，有的工厂，虽然也成立起工厂管理委员会，但不起作用。代表们对于官僚主义作风特别予以批评。炼焦一分厂代表热烈尖锐地批评了他们的郭秘书不关心工人的生活和福利，瞧不起工人，说“工人根本不配谈民主”，将工人们给自己提的意见私自压在一边等等。代表们一致指出，这种有害的官僚主义必须立即改正，代表大会已派出代表，分别到炼焦一分厂及其他被批评的工厂进行调查，以便解决。
    “我们是知道怎样负起自己主人翁的责任来的。”休会的时候，一位代表信心十足的这样说。
