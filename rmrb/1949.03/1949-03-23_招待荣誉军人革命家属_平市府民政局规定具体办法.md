Inviting and Hosting Honored Servicemen and Revolutionary Families
	Specific Measures Stipulated by the Ping City Government Civil Affairs Bureau

[Reported by this newspaper] Since the liberation of Beiping, the number of honored servicemen, revolutionary families, and individual straggler soldiers passing through from various regions has increased daily. Due to unfamiliarity with the area, they often experience difficulties with food and lodging. In light of this, the Municipal Government Civil Affairs Bureau has decided to establish "Reception Centers for Passing Servicemen and Revolutionary Families" in the fourth, sixth, eighth, ninth, tenth, twelfth, and eighteenth districts, as well as Fengtai and Tongzhou ninth districts, by the respective district governments. The reception measures are stipulated as follows: 1. The reception objects are limited to honored servicemen, revolutionary cadres, revolutionary families, and individual scattered soldiers, who hold certifying documents. Those without certifying documents will not be received. 2. For honored servicemen and on-the-job cadres who are entitled to supplies, food should be provided according to the original departmental standards, and grain coupons and food money should be paid. Those without grain coupons and food money must hold a certificate from their organization to be exempt from payment, and provide an IOU for reimbursement. 3. Revolutionary martyrs, military, and cadre family members who have certifying documents will be provided with supplies according to the general cadre treatment standards, and a receipt should be left for reimbursement. Those without certificates will not be supplied. 4. If any district has people who should be hosted, they should be referred to the nearest reception center, and no additional hospitality expenses should be incurred. The addresses and start dates of these reception centers will be announced separately.
