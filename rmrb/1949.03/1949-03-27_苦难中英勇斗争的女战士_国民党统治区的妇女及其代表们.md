　　Heroic Female Warriors Struggling in Hardship
    —Women and Their Representatives in the Kuomintang-Controlled Areas
    Although the representatives from the Kuomintang-controlled areas who are attending this Women's Congress are under the direct surveillance and restriction of reactionary forces, they are still able to participate in the congress. This is due to their disregard for hardship, their fearlessness of persecution along the way, and the assistance of the CCP and the People's Government, overcoming all kinds of difficulties. It is very rare that women representatives from areas that have not yet been liberated have the opportunity to participate in this grand meeting.

    The delegation from the KMT-controlled areas includes 19 units, including representatives from democratic women's groups and religious women's groups in Shanghai, Hong Kong and Kowloon, Kunming, Chongqing, Guilin, Nanjing, Chengdu, and other places, totaling 63 people; regional representatives from Qingdao, Taiwan, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Hong Kong, overseas Chinese, the Yangtze River basin, etc., totaling 29 people; however, the Preparatory Committee of the All-China Women's Federation is still afraid of missing any talents from various places, so it has specially invited 35 people, including professors, writers, artists, industrialists, and drama workers; totaling 134 people.

    The greater the pressure, the more intense the resistance and struggle. Democratic women in the KMT-controlled areas have been deprived of their basic rights to freedom of speech, publication, assembly, and association by the Kuomintang. They are often subjected to all kinds of fascist atrocities such as arbitrary arrest, private torture, and secret execution. In addition, they are often subjected to trampling on their careers and lives. These innumerable oppressions have aroused the boundless anger of women in the KMT-controlled areas, who deeply know that in order to remove these shackles and be saved from death, there is no other way but to unite with all the oppressed and fight against the brutal and to fight against hunger and dictatorship.

    More than a hundred women representatives from the KMT-controlled areas have been tempered in such an environment. Among them, regardless of their age or occupation, few have not been tracked by secret agents. Under cruel persecution, they have never been intimidated or succumbed, but have developed a spirit of self-sacrifice for the people. Whether in the labor movement, the student movement, or other activities, they are always courageous and forward-looking. Those attending the conference this time include female workers, female students, female teachers, women's movement workers, and mass leaders who have been engaged in revolutionary work for many years and have fought bravely in the anti-hunger and anti-persecution democratic movements. They all have rich experience in struggle.

    After the War of Resistance Against Japan, female workers did their best to preserve factory machinery and raw materials; however, the reactionary rulers rewarded them with stricter control and persecution after taking over. The Shanghai female worker representatives assured the conference with great confidence that when Shanghai is liberated, the workers will do everything possible to preserve the factories and warehouses intact, the power plants will immediately resume power supply, the water plants will immediately resume water supply, and cars and trams will continue to run on Nanjing Road, which has been sprinkled with the blood of workers. They are confident in turning Shanghai into a prosperous people's city.

    We believe that the representatives from the KMT-controlled areas will hold the hands of their disaster-stricken sisters in their hometowns, learn from the heroic and resourceful examples of the sisters in the liberated areas in combat and construction, and work together to welcome the arrival of the People's Liberation Army and build a new, people's democratic China.

　　苦难中英勇斗争的女战士
    ——国民党统治区的妇女及其代表们
    这次参加妇代大会的国民党统治区的代表，虽然受到反动势力的直接监视与限制，仍能参加大会，这是由于她们不避艰辛，不怕沿途迫害，和中共及人民政府的帮助，突破种种难关，使尚未解放的地区的妇女代表，享有参加盛会的机会，这是非常难得的。
    参加国统区代表团的有十九个单位，包括上海、港九、昆明、重庆、桂林、南京、成都等处的民主妇女团体及宗教性的妇女团体代表，共六十三名；地区代表有青岛、台湾、上海、广州、香港、华侨、长江流域等，共二十九名；但全国妇联筹委会仍恐各地贤能有遗珠之憾，因此又特定聘请一项，包括教授、作家、艺术家、产业家、戏剧工作者等共三十五名；总共一百三十四名。
    压力越大，反抗斗争越激烈。国统区民主妇女们被国民党剥夺了言论、出版、集会、结社自由的基本权利，经常遭受着任意拘捕、私刑拷打、秘密处死等种种法西斯暴行的袭击，还加之职业上、生活上关系，动辄遭到蹂躏。这些不胜记述的重重压迫，激起了国统区妇女们无比的愤怒，深知要想解除这些枷锁，从死亡中得救，除了与一切受迫害者团结起来向残暴者抗争，为反饥饿反独裁而战斗外，再没有第二条出路。
    百余名国统区妇女代表，就是在这样的环境里锻炼出来的，在她们之中，不管老的与少的，是何职业，很少不经过特务追踪的。她们在残酷迫害下，从未被吓倒与屈服，却养成了舍己为人民的精神。无论在工运，学运以及其他活动中，她们都是勇往直前。这次出席大会的有在反饥饿、反迫害民主运动中英勇斗争的女工、女学生、女教师、妇运工作者，以及多年从事革命工作的群众领袖。她们都有丰富的斗争经验。
    在抗日战争后，女工们曾尽力的保存工厂机器、原料；而反动统治者接收后报答她们的却是更严厉的管制、迫害。上海女工代表们，以极大的信心向大会保证，上海解放时，工人将尽一切力量把工厂仓库完整的保存下来，发电厂马上恢复送电，自来水厂马上恢复送水，汽车电车照常在曾经洒遍工人鲜血的南京路上奔驰，她们有信心把上海变成兴隆的人民城市。
    我们相信，国统区的代表们，将会挽着她们家乡的受灾难的姊妹们的手，学习解放区姊妹们在战斗中、在建设中的英勇机智的榜样，共同为迎接人民解放军的到来，为建设人民民主的新中国而奋斗。
