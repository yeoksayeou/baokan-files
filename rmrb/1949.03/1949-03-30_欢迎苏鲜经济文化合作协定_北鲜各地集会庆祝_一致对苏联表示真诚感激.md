　　Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 28th: In recent days, cities and villages in North Korea have held gatherings to welcome and celebrate the Economic and Cultural Cooperation Agreement between the Soviet Union and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. Mass meetings were held at the Pyongyang Freight Car Repair Factory, Rubber Shoe Factory, the Hungnam Chemical Factory, the Sehojin Paper Mill, and other places. At the meetings, workers and staff unanimously endorsed the government's foreign policy and praised the Soviet Union's friendly assistance to the Korean people. Park Tong-chun, a worker at the Sehojin Paper Mill, said at the factory's mass meeting: "Our country has signed an agreement with the world's most powerful country, the Soviet Union. This is an equal agreement. On behalf of the paper mill's employees, I thank the Soviet Union for its great help in restoring our factory. Now, the Soviet Union is helping us to smoothly develop our economy." Kim Hwa-geun, a worker at the Pyongyang Oxygen Plant, said: "The goods obtained under the agreement will help develop Korean industry. This is completely opposite to what the United States brings into South Korea. These goods are not perfume and worm-infested cornmeal, but the goods we truly need." The Democratic Korea newspaper published an editorial on the 25th, saying: "The agreement signed between the Soviet Union and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea reflects the Soviet Union's revolutionary and peaceful foreign policy principles of strengthening international friendship and respecting the sovereignty and equality of large and small countries. For the first time in history, the Korean people have signed an equal agreement. They express sincere gratitude to the Soviet government and the great Soviet people."

　　欢迎苏鲜经济文化合作协定
    北鲜各地集会庆祝
    一致对苏联表示真诚感激
    【新华社北平二十八日电】塔斯社平壤讯：北朝鲜城乡日来纷纷举行集会，欢迎并庆祝苏联与朝鲜人民民主共和国之间的经济与文化合作协定。平壤的货车修理厂、胶鞋工厂、兴南（译音）的化学工厂、西湖津的造纸厂及其他地方，都举行了群众大会。会上工人和职员同声赞同政府的外交政策，一致赞扬苏联对朝鲜人民的友好援助。西湖津造纸厂工人柏同春在该厂群众大会上说：“我国已与世界最强大的国家——苏联签订了协定。这是平等协定。我代表造纸厂职工感激曾经大力帮助我们恢复工厂的苏联。现在，苏联正在帮助我们顺利地发展经济。”平壤养气工厂工人金和根说：“依据协定所获得的货物，将有助于发展朝鲜工业。这与美国运入南朝鲜的东西完全相反。这些货物不是香水和生了虫的玉米粉，而是我们真正需要的货物。”民主朝鲜报于二十五日发表社论说：“苏联与朝鲜人民民主共和国签订的协定反映了苏联革命与和平、加强国际友谊与尊重大小国家的主权与平等的外交政策原则。朝鲜人民有史以来第一次签订了平等协定。他们对苏联政府与伟大的苏联人民表示真诚的感激。”
