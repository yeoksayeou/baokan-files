Xinhua News Agency, Beiping, March 1st: The former Kuomintang troops around Beiping awaiting reorganization have ended their original command system and are formally subordinate to the command of the People's Liberation Army Pingjin Front Headquarters. This new command relationship was formally announced at a meeting of officers at the division level and above from the reorganized troops on February 21st. This meeting was convened by the Political Department of the People's Liberation Army Pingjin Front Headquarters. Commander Lin Biao, Political Commissar Luo Ronghuan, Chief of Staff Liu Yalou, Director of the Political Department Tan Zheng, Deputy Director Tao Zhu, and General Guo Zongfen, representative of General Fu Zuoyi, personally presided over the meeting, which was attended by all officers at the division level and above from the reorganized troops.

The meeting began with a speech by Deputy Director Tao, announcing the reorganization plan. This plan had been exchanged several times between the Joint Office and General Fu Zuoyi, and everyone considered it reasonable. It had already been announced at a meeting of officers at the corps level of the reorganized Kuomintang army, and there were no objections. The plan stipulates:

	(1) The three-level command structures of the former Kuomintang army’s North China “Suppression Headquarters,” the Fourth and Ninth Corps Headquarters, and the eight Army Headquarters should all be terminated. All their staff and directly subordinate units will be incorporated into the People’s Liberation Army Pingjin Front Headquarters, the Corps Headquarters, and the Army Headquarters respectively. The twenty-five divisions under their command will be reorganized into independent divisions of the People's Liberation Army, and the special forces will be combined with the special forces of the People's Liberation Army.

	(2) Political workers in the Kuomintang troops who are willing to work in the People's Liberation Army must undergo training before being employed.

	(3) All levels of officers of the former Kuomintang troops who accept the work assigned by the People's Liberation Army, their families will enjoy the same treatment as cadres and their families of the People's Liberation Army.

	(4) Former Kuomintang troops who are willing to study further will be organized into classes according to their work positions and levels. During the study period, their treatment will be the same as that of cadres in active service.

	(5) Kuomintang officers who wish to return home will be dealt with in accordance with the following provisions:

	A. All officers returning home will be paid three months' salary at their original salary level.

	B. The Pingjin Front Headquarters will issue train tickets and provide food and accommodation along the way in the liberated areas (including their families).

	C. Except for weapons and public property, all private property can be taken away.

	D. Kuomintang officers returning home may be allowed to take one or two guards with them, depending on their work position and needs.

	E. Kuomintang officers residing in the liberated areas can be allotted their share of land after returning home; if they belong to landlord families, their land and property, whether distributed or not, shall be dealt with in accordance with Article 8 of the Land Law Outline. As for themselves, as long as they abide by all the laws and decrees of the democratic government in the future, their past behaviors towards the peasants will not be investigated.

	F. All Kuomintang troops returning home will be issued a "Certificate of Participation in the Peaceful Liberation of Beiping," and they will still be welcomed to work in the People's Liberation Army in the future.

Deputy Director Tao explained that the above measures were taken because the Kuomintang officers who participated in the peaceful liberation of Beiping have made contributions to the country and the people, and have set an example for peaceful resolution throughout the country. Therefore, the People's Liberation Army and the people are willing to reward and give them preferential treatment.

Subsequently, Commander Lin and Political Commissar Luo gave instructions on the reorganization issue. Commander Lin first expressed his welcome to the officers who came to accept the reorganization, and pointed out that the purpose of this reorganization is to make the original Kuomintang troops in Beiping become the People's Liberation Army in substance, an army that serves the people's interests, liberates the people, and belongs to the people. This requires a thorough transformation in political nature and ideological style. He explained the characteristics of the People's Liberation Army from the perspective of class essence, and from the internal and external relations of the army. He pointed out that the termination of the old command structure and the establishment of a new command relationship will facilitate the innovation of the army and the progress of all officers and soldiers. As for the personnel staying or leaving, Commander Lin said that as long as they are willing to progress, willing to participate in the revolution, and support all the policies of the Chinese Communist Party, we will allow them to participate in the work. He pointed out that Chiang Kai-shek's military strength has been basically defeated, and the People's Liberation Army has become an irresistible force. The situation of national unification can be realized soon. Under this situation, the manpower of the whole country should be used to engage in huge construction work. Therefore, he encouraged everyone to recognize this new and huge change, strive for progress, implement a fundamental change, and transform the old army into a new people's army. In his speech, Political Commissar Luo pointed out that this reorganization is not just a simple military reorganization, not just changing flags and changing numbers, but a political reorganization. This is to reorganize the army of the great landlords and big bourgeoisie commanded by Chiang Kai-shek into an army of the people. This is a fundamental change of position. He instructed that to be reorganized into the People's Liberation Army, the first thing to do is to learn the set of political systems of the People's Liberation Army. After introducing the political system of the People's Liberation Army, Political Commissar Luo pointed out that the political system of the People's Liberation Army is fundamentally different from that of the Kuomintang army. Because the People's Liberation Army is an army of the people and has mastered the truth of the revolution, the political system of the People's Liberation Army relies on enlightening the soldiers' consciousness, telling the truth, and promoting democracy; while the political system in the Kuomintang army is to control the troops by a few people, and they adopt the method of relying on secret agents to monitor and deceive. Political Commissar Luo instructed the officers present not to be afraid of promoting democracy in the troops, but to see if they have the determination to progress. He announced that in order to realize the reorganization, the Political Department of the People's Liberation Army Pingjin Front will send political cadres to the reorganized troops to improve the awareness of officers and soldiers, make the troops progress, and make the relationship between officers and soldiers and the relationship between the army and the people焕然一新.

Finally, Chief of Staff Liu announced that the command relationship and supply relationship of the reorganized troops would be treated the same in accordance with the regulations of the People's Liberation Army. The new designations of each independent division were immediately issued. The reorganization meeting ended in a pleasant atmosphere. In the evening, the Political Department of the Pingjin Front Headquarters hosted a banquet for all the officers attending the meeting, and the Propaganda Team of the Political Department of the Pingjin Front Headquarters held an evening party, performing programs such as "Yang Yong's Meritorious Service." The officers attending the meeting appreciated various performances reflecting the life and style of the People's Liberation Army, and expressed great interest and praised them. Everyone enjoyed themselves until late at night before dispersing.

    林彪司令员指示：国民党军已基本打垮，全国即将统一；受编军官应认识这一新变革，力求进步。
    罗荣桓政委指示：改编是要根本换一个立场  先须学习解放军政治制度
    【新华社北平一日电】北平周围听候改编的原国民党军队，结束其原有的指挥系统，正式隶属人民解放军平津前线司令部指挥。这一新的指挥关系，已于二月二十一日受编部队师级以上军官会议中正式宣布。此次会议系由人民解放军平津前线司令部政治部召集。林彪司令员、罗荣桓政委、刘亚楼参谋长、政治部主任谭政、副主任陶铸、傅作义将军代表郭宗汾将军均亲临主持，受编部队师级以上军官全体出席。
    会议首由陶副主任致词，宣布改编方案。这一方案曾由联合办事处和傅作义将军几次交换意见，大家认为合理，并已在受编国民党军兵团一级军官会议中宣布，均无异议。此项方案规定：
    （一）原国民党军华北“剿总”、第四、第九两个兵团部和八个军部的三级指挥机构应全结束，其所有工作人员与直属队分别编入人民解放军平津前线司令部与各兵团部及各军部，其所属的二十五个师则改编为人民解放军独立师，各特种部队则与解放军的特种部队合编。
    （二）国民党部队中的政工人员，愿留解放军工作的，须经过训练，再行录用。
    （三）原国民党部队各级军官凡接受解放军分配工作的，其本人和家属均按解放军各级干部和家属享受同样待遇。
    （四）原国民党部队军官中愿意学习深造的，按其工作职位与程度，分班组织学习。学习期间，其待遇与在职干部相同。
    （五）国民党军官中，愿意回家的，按以下规定处理：
    甲、回家军官一律按原薪发给三个月薪饷。
    乙、由平津前线司令部发给车票，在解放区沿途供给食宿（包括其家属在内）。
    丙、除不许携带武器及公用资财外，一切私人财物均可全部带走。
    丁、回家的国民党军官可按其工作职务与需要，酌许带一二名护兵同行。
    戊、凡在解放区居住的国民党军官，回家后可分得应有的一份土地；如其本人系地主家庭，则其土地财产不论已分与未分，均按土地法大纲第八条之规定处理。至其本人，只须今后遵守民主政府一切法令，其过去对于农民的行为如何，一概不加追究。
    己、回家的国民党军，一律发给“参加北平和平解放证明书”，以后愿来解放军工作，仍然受到欢迎。
    陶副主任说明：采取以上措施，是因为参加此次北平和平解放的国民党军官们，有功国家，有功人民，并且给全国树立了一个和平解决的榜样，所以解放军和人民愿意加以奖励和优待。
    继即由林司令员罗政委就改编问题加以指示。林司令员首先向到会接受改编的军官们表示欢迎之意，并指出：此次改编的目的，是要使北平原有的国民党部队在实质上成为人民解放军，成为为了人民利益、解放人民、属于人民的军队，这就必须从政治性质上和思想作风上都来个彻底的转变。他从阶级本质上、从军队的内部和外部关系上，说明人民解放军的特质。指出：旧的指挥机构的结束，和新的指挥关系的建立，将便于军队的革新，便于全体官兵的进步。至于人员的去留，林司令员表示：只要是愿意进步，愿意参加革命，拥护中共一切政策的人，我们一概允其参加工作。他指出：目前蒋介石的军事力量已经基本打垮，解放军已成为一个不可抗的力量，全国统一的局面很快可以实现。在此形势下，全国的人力都应当用来从事庞大的建设工作。因此，他勉励大家认识这一新的巨大的变革，努力进步，实行一个根本的改变，将旧军队改变为新的人民的军队。罗政委在他的讲话中指出：这次改编不只是简单的军事改编，不仅仅是改旗易帜，换个番号，而是一种政治的改编。这是将蒋介石所指挥的大地主、大资产阶级的军队，改编为人民的军队，这是要根本改换一个立场的问题。他指示：要改编为人民解放军，首先就要学习解放军的一套政治制度。在介绍了解放军的政治制度后，罗政委指出解放军的政治制度与国民党军队根本不同。由于解放军是人民的军队，掌握了革命的真理，所以解放军的一套政治制度，是依靠启发战士自觉，讲真理，讲民主；而国民党军队中的政治制度，则是为了少数人控制部队，其所采取的是依靠特务监视和欺骗蒙蔽的办法。罗政委指示到会军官们，不要害怕发扬部队中的民主，而是要看自己有没有决心进步。他宣布：为了实现改编，人民解放军平津前线政治部将派出政治干部到各受编的部队，以提高官兵的觉悟，使部队进步，使得官兵关系军民关系焕然一新。
    最后，刘参谋长宣布关于改编部队的指挥关系与供给关系问题一律按照解放军的规定同样待遇。当即颁发各独立师的新番号。改编会议在愉悦的气氛中结束。晚间，平津前线司令部政治部设宴招待全体与会军官，并由平津前线政治部宣传队举行晚会，演出“杨勇立功”等节目，到会军官欣赏了反映解放军生活和作风的各种演唱，深感兴趣，备致赞扬，至深夜始尽欢而散。
