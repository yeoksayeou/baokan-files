Yangquan City
    Strengthens Communication Work
    [Shijiazhuang News] The Propaganda Department of the Yangquan Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China held a meeting of special correspondents on March 9 to review the communication work of the past two months. The city had held a meeting of special correspondents on January 10. At this meeting, everyone reviewed their fear of using their brains, perfunctory attitudes, and dependence on others. The leadership also failed to strictly inspect and supervise. Suggestions were made to the newspaper that it should provide more assistance to the correspondents and return unused manuscripts with comments. Regarding future writing, it was unanimously agreed that each person should write at least one article per month, and write articles as soon as work is done, and gradually improve the quality on the basis of writing more.

　　阳泉市
    加强通讯工作
    【石家庄讯】中共阳泉市委宣传部，于三月九日召开特约通讯员会议，检查两月来通讯工作。该市曾于一月十日召开过特约通讯员会议，在这次会上，大家检讨了怕费脑子，应付了事及依赖思想。而领导上也没有严格检查督促。对报社提出：对通讯员应多加帮助，不用的稿应提出意见退回。在今后写稿上，一致同意每人一月至少写一篇，作了工作就写稿，在多写的基础上，逐步提高质量。
