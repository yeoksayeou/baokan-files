    [Jinan News] In Wei County, the Third District recently captured three armed bandit secret agents, including Li Baozhong, in Nanxinzhuang, and seized two pistols. They all came from Anyang and had registered with the district government for repentance, and had falsely claimed to "return to Anyang City to disintegrate the puppet army and perform meritorious service to redeem their sins" in order to deceive the government. In reality, they lived in Guo Ze's home in Nanxinzhuang, using lavish eating and drinking to win over village cadres. During interrogation, they confessed that their purpose was to carry out assassinations.
