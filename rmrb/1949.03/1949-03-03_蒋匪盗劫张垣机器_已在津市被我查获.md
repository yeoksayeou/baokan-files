[Zhangjiakou Dispatch] The various types of machinery, totaling over 390 units, that were looted from the Zhangjiakou and Xuanhua Comprehensive Machine Factory by the Kuomintang bandit gang before the liberation of the two cities have now been recovered in Tianjin by the Tianjin Military Control Commission. The North China People's Government, in order to restore and rebuild the heavy industry of Zhangjiakou and Xuanhua, has decided to transport all of it back. Currently, the Enterprise Takeover Group of the Zhangjiakou Military Control Commission has dispatched personnel to Tianjin to begin handling the transportation work. The Comprehensive Machine Factory has over 800 employees and was formed during the Kuomintang bandit gang's rule of Zhangjiakou by combining the machines of the former North China Machine Factory in Zhangjiakou, the Xinhua Machine Factory in Xuanhua, and some of the machinery that Japan compensated China with. Part of the machinery is automatic, making it the largest machine factory on the Ping-Sui Railway line.
