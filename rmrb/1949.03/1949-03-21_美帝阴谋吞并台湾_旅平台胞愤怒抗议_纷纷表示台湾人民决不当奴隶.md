Xinhua News Agency, North China, 20th -- The news of U.S. imperialist plots to annex Taiwan has aroused anger among Taiwan compatriots residing in Beiping. Zhan Yichang, executive director of the Taiwan Compatriots Association in Beiping, said: "The U.S. imperialists' aggression against Taiwan and the traitor Chiang Kai-shek's betrayal of Taiwan did not begin today, but now the conspiracy is even more blatant. However, the people of Taiwan absolutely do not want to and will never be slaves of imperialism again. The people of Taiwan cannot tolerate the so-called 'independence' plot of the American imperialists and their running dogs to invade and enslave the people of Taiwan, and will certainly not accept any trusteeship. The 'February 28th' uprising is a powerful proof of this. In the future, we must carry out the revolution to the end under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party. The cause of the Chinese revolution cannot be considered complete without the liberation of Taiwan." He also pointed out that the pseudo "People's League" organized by the Taiwanese traitors Liao Wenyi and Liao Wenkui brothers cannot represent the six million Taiwan compatriots. He said: These scoundrels must be eliminated. Mr. Yang, a Taiwan compatriot residing in Beiping, also said angrily: "The activities of the U.S. imperialists and traitorous lackeys must be crushed by the power of the people of the whole country."

　　美帝阴谋吞并台湾
    旅平台胞愤怒抗议
    纷纷表示台湾人民决不当奴隶
    【新华社华北二十日电】美国帝国主义阴谋吞并我台湾的消息传到北平后，激起了旅平台胞的愤怒。台胞旅平同乡会常务理事詹以昌说：“美帝国主义对台湾的侵略及卖国贼蒋介石的出卖台湾，不是从今天才开始的，现在则阴谋更形露骨。但是台湾人民绝对不愿也不会再当帝国主义的奴隶。台湾人民不能容忍美国帝国主义者及其走狗们侵略与奴役台湾人民的所谓‘独立’的阴谋，更不会接受什么托管。‘二·二八’起义便是一个有力的证明，今后我们要在中国共产党领导下将革命进行到底。台湾不解放，中国革命的事业不能算完成。”他又指出台奸廖文毅、廖文奎兄弟几个人所组织的伪“民众同盟”，决不能代表六百万台胞。他说：这些败类一定要清除。旅平台胞杨君也愤愤地说：“美国帝国主义和卖国奴才们的活动，一定要被全国人民的力量所粉碎。”
