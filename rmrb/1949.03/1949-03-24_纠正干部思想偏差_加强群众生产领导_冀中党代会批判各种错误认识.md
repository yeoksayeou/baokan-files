　　Correcting Cadre Ideological Deviations
    Strengthening Mass Production Leadership
    Hebei-Central Party Congress Criticizes Various Erroneous Perceptions
    [Our Newspaper Dispatches] The Hebei-Central District Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, during its Party Representative Congress to discuss agricultural production guidelines and plans, discovered and corrected some ideological deviations among cadres regarding the campaign to launch a large-scale production drive this year. Many comrades still lack confidence in implementing the year-round agricultural production effort, believing it will be "a flurry of activity in the spring" only to be squeezed out by other tasks. Secondly, in discussing this year's production guidelines, tasks, and increased production plans, most counties only focused one-sidedly on the foundation of last year's work, leading to the accommodation of certain farmers' conservative and backward production habits, while neglecting the guiding role of the Party. For example, when discussing planting cotton and peanuts, it was felt that the masses were not accustomed to planting them and therefore could not do so. In areas such as Anguo and Jin County, there is a lot of white sandy soil with ample conditions for planting peanuts, but because the masses have rarely or never planted them, the leadership believed it was impossible. Thirdly, there was insufficient spirit of trusting and organizing the masses. It was thought that only government loans for cotton and peanut seeds and fertilizers could guarantee the completion of increased production tasks (of course, the government can provide some necessary loans in particularly difficult circumstances). Fourthly, when discussing and formulating production plans, most counties engaged in very poor discussions about how to organize various specific tasks to achieve the plan, which will likely result in empty slogans. After repeated discussions in groups, especially after the summary report by Comrade Lin Tie, Secretary of the District Party Committee, the above-mentioned ideological deviations were generally resolved.
    [Another Dispatch] In order to promote various specific tasks for driving large-scale production, Hebei-Central specifically convened a meeting of leaders of production promotion societies, heads of agricultural science departments (county heads attended where the former were not available), and representatives from water conservancy promotion societies, experimental farms, and breeding farms. This meeting specifically discussed breeding livestock, constructing water conservancy projects, planting trees and forests, improving agricultural technology, and agricultural loans, and researched specific methods of implementation. At the same time, the Agricultural Department of the Administrative Office dispatched four people to Jin County, Anguo, and Renqiu to participate in county production meetings, to understand the transmission and implementation of this conference in various counties, as well as what problems may arise during implementation and the ideological state of cadres, in order to discover problems, gain experience, and guide the region's production movement.
                                                                                                (Wei Jin)

　　纠正干部思想偏差
    加强群众生产领导
    冀中党代会批判各种错误认识
    【本报讯】中共冀中区党委在召开党代表会议，讨论农业生产方针计划时，发现并纠正了干部对今年开展大生产运动在思想上的一些偏差。不少同志对开展农业生产贯彻全年尚缺乏信心，认为不过又是“春季热闹一阵”，其他工作一到，就把大生产挤掉。其次，一般的县在讨论今年的生产方针任务和增产计划时，只片面的从去年的工作基础着眼，产生了迁就某些农民保守落后生产习惯，而忽视了党的领导作用。如讨论种棉花、花生时，觉得群众没有习惯不能种。如安国、晋县等地，有不少的白沙土，有充分条件可以种花生，但群众很少种过或没有种过，在领导思想上即认为不能种。第三、相信群众、组织群众力量的精神不够，在思想上认为只有政府贷给棉花、花生种籽与肥料，才能保证增产任务的完成（当然特别困难的，政府发放一部必要的贷款是可以的）。第四、在讨论与拟定生产计划时，一般的县对如何组织实现计划的各种具体工作，讨论很差，这样结果势必可能发生空嚷计划。上述各种思想偏差，经过小组反复讨论，特别是区党委书记林铁同志总结报告后，一般均得到解决。
    【又讯】为实现推动大生产各种具体工作，冀中专门召开了推进社主任、农业科长（没有来者县长参加）与水利推进社、试验场、繁殖场会议，具体讨论了繁殖牲口、兴修水利、植树造林、改良农业技术、农贷等工作，研究出实现的具体办法。同时行署农业处派出四人到晋县、安国、任邱参加县生产会议，了解各县对此次会议的传达与贯彻情形，及贯彻中可能发生什么问题，和干部思想情况，以便发现问题，取得经验，指导全区生产运动。
