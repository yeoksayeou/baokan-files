In the Northeast liberated areas, women's work in the past three years has adhered to the basic principle of mobilizing women to participate in production. At the same time, the development of women's work has always been combined with the revolutionary movements of the general public. Therefore, the development and progress of the women's movement have been relatively rapid, especially in participating in the construction of the new Northeast, with brilliant achievements.

　　Since 1947, after women were allocated land in the land reform, they have participated more extensively in the large-scale production movement. In 1948, there were 3 million rural working women in Northeast China who actively participated in spring plowing, summer weeding, autumn harvesting, famine relief, and disaster relief, ensuring that all land was planted and completing the autumn harvest one month ahead of schedule. In some areas, such as Yanji County in Jilin Province, 51 percent of the female labor force participated in spring plowing, 70 percent in summer weeding, and 93 percent in autumn harvesting. In Zhida Village, Songjiang Province, 90 percent of the female labor force participated in production. A large number of female labor models emerged in agricultural production, becoming the direction for rural working women in the entire Northeast. In terms of sideline production, women participated in spinning, weaving mats, weaving straw hats, raising pigs, and raising chickens, which also greatly increased social and family wealth.

　　It is worth mentioning that female workers in Northeast cities have shown great strength in industrial construction. In the light industrial production of cities such as Shenyang and Andong, female workers have been in a decisive position. In a certain region with a large city in Northeast China, there are more than 24,300 female workers, who have shown great labor enthusiasm and initiative in production, mastering modern industrial technology. More than 120 female workers have participated in the heavy industrial production of railway factories, undertaking important work tasks such as lathes, chemicals, and welding. There are also four female technicians. In other fields such as electrical plants and locomotive depots, industrial female workers work side by side with male workers. In light industry, the factories affiliated to a certain region's industrial company alone have 3,725 female workers. In a textile factory in a large city in Northeast China, the number of female workers is 1,050, accounting for 58 percent of the total number of workers. In a rubber factory, female workers account for 70 percent of the total number of workers. In Jin County Textile Factory, female workers account for more than 47 percent of the total number of workers, of which 1,622 out of 1,831 female workers have become skilled workers. The total number of female workers in Andong City is 6,449, including 708 female heroines and 5 female factory directors. Among the 99 model workers in Andong City, 17 are female model workers. The female workers in the recently liberated Shenyang City are even more commendable for their enthusiasm in resuming production. The People's Liberation Army entered the city on November 2nd, and officially started work on the 8th and 9th, completing the arduous task of producing 800,000 sets of shirts for the troops entering the pass within 20 days together with the male workers. The liberation of Shenyang was only four months ago. Female workers in clothing factories generally exceeded the prescribed operation standards by one-third, and the labor efficiency of female workers in rubber shoe factories has been greatly improved. Now the labor of 50 people has completed the output of 130 people during the Kuomintang period. In short, female workers in the Northeast liberated areas have become one of the main forces in industrial production and have become the backbone of urban women.

　　Since 1946, some female intellectuals in Northeast China have participated in land reform work. They have been tested and tempered in the struggle, proving that female intellectuals can achieve rapid progress once they are combined with the working masses of workers and peasants. Female intellectuals have also played a great role in supporting the front lines and construction work, especially in medical work, education work, and childcare work, where female intellectuals have occupied a very important position. According to incomplete statistics from departments directly under the Northeast Military Region, 3,643 women participated in health work, including 159 female doctors.

　　Childcare work in various cities has also developed considerably in the past year. According to current incomplete statistics, there are 34 large-scale nurseries. Children have received education, and mothers have been able to exert their greater enthusiasm in work.

　　Through land reform, production, and supporting the front-line movements, working women have fully demonstrated their great strength and creativity. Their status in society and families has been improved, and their organizational and awareness levels have been enhanced. Under the leadership of the Communist Party, women have created a new page in the history of the Northeast women's movement through their own efforts and have become an indispensable force in building a new Northeast.

　　There are also some shortcomings in the women's work in the Northeast liberated areas, especially because our women's work at all levels is not in-depth enough, which also makes our reflection of women's special needs not specific enough, and the exchange and accumulation of women's work experience is not enough. All these need to be worked harder in the future, to closely unite the more than 20 million women in the entire Northeast, form a steel-like force, and strive to mobilize women to actively produce and strive to participate in various social undertakings to build a new Northeast for the people.

### 东北工农业生产中　妇女起伟大作用

　　东北工农业生产中
  　妇女起伟大作用
    东北解放区的妇女工作，最近三年来，坚持发动妇女参加生产的基本方针，同时使妇女工作的开展，始终与一般群众的革命运动相结合，所以妇女运动的发展和进步比较迅速，特别在参加新东北的建设工作方面，有着辉煌的成绩。
    自一九四七年开始，妇女们在土改中分得土地以后，更广泛地参加了大生产运动。一九四八年在东北即有三百万农村劳动妇女，踊跃地参加了春耕，夏锄，秋收，救荒，救灾，保证全部土地种上，并提早完成秋收一个月的任务。个别地区如吉林延吉县，有百分之五十一的妇女劳力参加了春耕，百分之七十的妇女劳力参加了夏锄，百分之九十三的妇女劳力参加了秋收。松江省志达村百分之九十的妇女劳力都参加了生产，在农业生产中涌现了大批的妇女劳动模范，他们成为全东北农村劳动妇女的方向。在副业生产方面，妇女参加了纺织、编席、编草帽、喂猪、养鸡等，也大大的增加了社会和家庭的财富。
    值得大书特书的是东北城市的女工，他们在工业建设中，显示了巨大的力量。在沈阳、安东等城市轻工业生产中，女工已处于决定的地位。东北某一拥有较大城市的地区，即有女工二万四千三百余人，他们在生产中发挥了极大的劳动热情和积极性，掌握了现代化的工业技术，有一百二十余名女职工参加了铁路工厂的重工业生产，担当了重要的工作任务，如车床、化学、熔接、并有四名技术女工，其他如电气场、机务段，都有产业女工与男工友并肩工作；另有一百三十二名女工、三十四名女职员分别参加了船渠、旋盘、电气、翻沙、锅炉、现图等生产。在轻工业方面，某一个地区的实业公司所属各厂就有女工三千七百二十五名。东北一个大城市的纺织厂女工人数一○五○人，占全体工人总数百分之五十八，胶皮工厂女工占全厂工人百分之七十。金县纺织厂女工占全厂工人百分之四十七强，其中一千八百三十一名女工中就有一千六百二十二名已成为熟练工人。安东市女工总数六千四百四十九人，其中女功臣七百零八名，女厂长五人，全安东市工人模范九十九人，其中女工模范十七人。最近解放的沈阳市女工，他们积极恢复生产的情绪更为可嘉，十一月二号解放军进城，八、九号即正式开工，并于二十天内与男工们一起完成了入关部队八十万套衬衣的艰巨任务。沈阳的解放，为时仅仅四个月，被服厂女工一般超过规定作业标准的三分之一，胶鞋厂女工劳动效率大大提高，现在五十人的劳动就完成了国民党时期一百三十人的产量。总之，东北解放区的女工已经成为工业生产中的主力之一，并成为城市妇女的骨干。
    东北女知识分子从一九四六年开始，就有一部分参加了土地改革工作，他们在斗争中得到了考验和锻炼，证明了女知识分子一旦能与工农大众结合，就能获得飞跃的进步。女知识分子在支援前线和建设工作上，也起了很大作用，特别是在医务工作、教育工作、保育工作中，女知识分子已占极重要的地位，仅以东北军区直属部门不完全统计，即有三千六百四十三个妇女参加卫生工作，其中女医生即有一百五十九人。
    各城市中保育工作在最近一年来亦有相当发展，据现在不完全统计即有较大规模的托儿所三十四个，儿童得到了教养，母亲们能够发挥他们更高的积极性从事工作。
    通过土地改革、生产、支援前线运动。劳动妇女充分发挥了伟大力量和创造性，他们在社会上家庭中的地位提高了，他们的组织性和觉悟程度增强了，妇女群众在共产党的领导下以自己的努力，创造了东北妇女运动史上崭新的一页，并成为建设新东北的不可缺少的力量。
    东北解放区的妇女工作中，也还存在着一些缺点，特别是由于我们各地各级的妇女工作不够深入，也就使我们对妇女特殊要求的反映不够具体，妇女工作经验的交流和累积也不够。这一些，都要在今后的工作中更加努力，紧紧团结全东北二千多万妇女群众，组成一支钢铁的力量，为发动妇女积极生产、努力参加各种社会事业建设人民的新东北而奋斗。
