　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 1st. TASS reports: The Leningrad Oblast and Leningrad City Federation of Trade Unions held a representative conference on February 25th. Attending this conference were 10,000 representatives of 1.4 million trade union members. The conference particularly warmly discussed the declaration given to the Leningrad Oblast Federation of Trade Unions Committee in the name of 950,000 workers in Lancashire and Cheshire, England, which denounced the aggressive policies of the American and British warmongers, opposed the signing of the Atlantic Pact, and demanded peace and the strengthening of Anglo-Soviet friendship.

　　Speakers at the conference, including Comrade Grigoriev, Chairman of the Leningrad Oblast Federation of Trade Unions Committee, denounced the instigators of a new war and called for intensified struggle for peace and for the unity of the international workers' movement. Grigoriev's and others' speeches were repeatedly interrupted by thunderous applause.

　　The delegates to the conference, representing 1.4 million workers in Leningrad Oblast and Leningrad City, wrote a letter to the Lancashire and Cheshire Area Committee of the Anglo-Soviet Association and the Lancashire and Cheshire Trade Union Federation, stating that the Soviet Union has consistently and resolutely pursued a policy of international peace and friendship. The Soviet Union has consistently expressed its sincere desire to strengthen international cooperation, establish friendly relations with the United States and Britain, and develop economic relations between Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union as much as possible. However, the ruling groups in the United States and Britain have responded to the Soviet Union's peace policy by organizing the "North Atlantic Pact" and other aggressive blocs against peace and against the Soviet Union. Dear comrades! You are absolutely right to emphasize in your declaration that the people of the world do not want war and can prevent war. Our great leader and teacher, Comrade Stalin, said: "The people of all countries still have vivid memories of the horrors of the last war. The strength of the peace-loving masses of the people is so great for the Churchill disciples who are carrying out aggression that they cannot overcome this strength and cannot turn this strength into a new war." We appeal to you and all the workers of Britain to promote friendship between the peoples of Britain and the Soviet Union in order to jointly fight against the instigators of another war.

　　列宁格勒职工致函英国工人
    号召共同打击战争挑拨者
    【新华社陕北一日电】塔斯社报导：列宁格勒州与列宁格勒市职工会于二月二十五日举行代表大会。出席这一会议的有代表一百四十万职工会会员的一万名代表。会议特别热烈地讨论了以英国兰开夏与装夏九十五万工人的名义交给列宁格勒州职工会委员会的宣言，该宣言痛斥美英战争贩子的侵略政策，反对签订大西洋公约，要求和平与加强英苏友谊。
    在代表大会上发言的人们，包括列宁格勒州职工会委员会主席格列加里叶夫在内，都痛斥新战争的挑拨者，并号召加紧为和平、为国际职工运动的团结而斗争。格列加里叶夫等的发言，曾一再为雷动的掌声所中断。
    大会代表列宁格勒州与列宁格勒市一百四十万职工，写信给英苏协会兰开夏与柴夏区委员会及兰开夏与柴夏工会联合会，该信内称：苏联始终坚决地奉行着国际和平与友好的政策。苏联一贯表示真诚的愿望，要加强国际合作、与美英两国建立友好关系、尽可能发展英美和苏联相互间的经济关系。但是，美英统治集团却用组织“北大西洋公约”及组织其他反对和平、反对苏联的侵略集团，来回答苏联的和平政策。亲爱的同志们！你们在宣言中强调全世界人民不愿战争而且可以防止战争，这是完全正确的。我们的伟大领袖与导师斯大林同志说过：“上次战争的惨象，各国人民的记忆犹新。主张和平的人民大众的力量，对进行侵略的邱吉尔门徒们来说，是如此强大，他们战胜不了这种力量，不能将这种力量转向新的战争去”。我们向你们及英国的一切工人呼吁，促进英苏两国人民间的友谊，以便共同对另一次战争的挑拨者进行斗争。
