A Record of the National Women's Congress Exhibition
　　Bai Sheng

　　Along with the grand occasion of the National Women's Congress, the concurrently held Congress Exhibition in Peiping has officially opened at Sun Yat-sen Hall in Zhongshan Park.

　　The exhibition is arranged throughout the entire Sun Yat-sen Hall. The venue is so radiant and full. Two huge portraits of Chairman Mao and Stalin, woven by sixteen female workers from the Northeast, hang high in the center of the venue. The four walls are covered with photographs, and two large exhibition rooms are filled with displays. Among them are scenes of making military shoes and clothing, caring for the wounded, organizing stretcher teams, standing guard, grinding military grain, sending sons and husbands to join the army... Many women even joined the militia, organized demolition teams, hid the wounded, and delivered intelligence through enemy blockades. Those vivid scenes of practical life are truly moving.

　　In the process of land reform and various labor productions, they all actively participated and contributed great strength; such as the large amount of homespun cloth woven in various places, as well as exquisite embroidery and lace exported to the international market. More importantly, they manufactured military industrial products such as bullets, explosives, and military rubber shoes, which directly defeated the enemy. In agriculture, participation in production was even more widespread. In addition to helping with farming, they raised silkworms, reeled silk, organized mutual aid, and launched production competitions, realizing the slogan of achieving good quantity and quality in everything. Sideline production such as weaving straw hats, mats, hemp rope, and raising livestock not only supplied the daily needs of the people but also changed the mistaken view that "women are useless" and raised the status of women in society.

　　Among all the labor products, the most noteworthy are the batches of homemade military shoes and homespun military uniforms sent to the front lines. For many years, thousands upon thousands of women in the liberated areas have made large quantities of military cloth and military shoes to send to the soldiers at the front. From those dense and solid stitches, we can deeply see how much they love the People's Liberation Army! In the two and a half years of the Liberation War alone, women in the rural areas of the liberated areas made more than 50 million pairs of military shoes.

　　In supporting the front lines, participating in labor production, and various constructions, a large number of women labor heroes and model workers have emerged. The exhibition includes the story of the heroic sacrifice of Liu Hulan, a sixteen-year-old national female hero, the story of Grandma Wang and her son…etc. Their heroic high level of work enthusiasm and spirit of serving the people have created many amazing achievements.

　　Another part of the exhibition that is also noteworthy is the photos of the Chinese liberated area women representatives receiving a warm welcome from all the representatives of the International Democratic Women's Federation at the International Democratic Women's Federation Congress, and many precious gifts given to the Chinese women's delegation by international democratic women's organizations. This not only shows the great friendship and respect of international democratic women for Chinese women, but also embodies the improvement of Chinese women's international status. However, we know that all this is only under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party that Chinese women can show such great strength and contribution.

　　记全国妇代大会展览会
    柏生
    随着全国妇代大会的盛会，同时在平举行的大会展览会，已经正式在中山公园中山堂揭幕了。
    展览会布置在整个的中山堂。会场里是那么辉耀丰满。十六个东北女工编制的毛主席和斯大林的巨幅大像，高悬在会场的正中。四壁布满的照片和装满两个大展览室的陈列品。其中有作军鞋、军衣，看护伤员，组织担架队，放哨，磨军粮，送子送郎参军，……许多妇女还加入了民兵，组织了爆炸队，隐蔽伤员，通过敌人封锁线送情报等。那种生动的实际生活的场面真是动人极了。
    在土地改革和各种劳动生产的过程中，她们都踊跃的参加了，并且都贡献出很大的力量；如各地织好的大量土布，以及输出于国际市场的精致绣花、花边。更有制造直接战胜敌人的军用工业生产品的子弹、炸药和军用胶鞋等。农业方面参加生产的更是普遍了，她们除了帮助下地耕种外，养蚕、缫丝、组织互助，展开了生产竞赛，实现了达到数量质量样样都好的口号。副业的生产如编草帽、席子、麻线、养牲畜等，不仅供给了人民日常生活的需要，同时也改变了“妇女不顶用”的错误观点，提高了妇女在社会上的地位。
    在所有的劳动生产品中最值得注意的，是那些成批送到前方去的土制的军鞋和土布军衣。多少年来，解放区千千万万的妇女，做了大量的军布、军鞋送给前方战士。从那一针针细密结实的缝线上，我们可以深切的看到她们对解放军是怎样的热爱！仅两年半的解放战争中，解放区农村的妇女，就做了上五千万双的军鞋。
    在支援前线，参加劳动生产，以及各种建设中，都涌现了大批的妇女劳动英雄、模范工作者。那里面陈列了十六岁的民族女英雄刘胡兰壮烈牺牲的故事，王大妈和她的儿子的故事……等。她们英勇的高度的工作热忱和为人民服务的精神，创造出许多惊人的成绩。
    展览中的另一部份，也是令人注目的，是那些关于中国解放区妇女代表，在参加国际民主妇联代表大会上，受到国际妇联全体代表热烈欢迎的照片，和许多国际民主妇女团体送给中国妇女代表团的珍贵礼品。这不但显示了国际民主妇女对中国妇女伟大的友谊和敬意，同时更体现了中国妇女在国际地位上的提高。然而我们知道：这一切，只有在中国共产党领导之下，中国妇女才会表现了这种伟大的力量和贡献。
