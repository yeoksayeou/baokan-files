　　The Development of the Songhou Village Supply and Marketing Cooperative
    Taihang Branch
    The Songhou Village Cooperative has changed its blind pursuit of profit as its operating principle, and has grasped the central link of the cooperative's business - supply and marketing. Through supply and marketing, the middleman's exploitation of the members is avoided. By first selling their products, and being able to supply the members with necessities and means of production in a timely manner, the improvement of member production is stimulated and facilitated. The branch reported the business achievements of the Songhou Village Cooperative, but did not touch upon the following issues. For example: Does the cooperative not distribute dividends according to the principles of the supply and marketing cooperative? Does it only trade with members, or does it also trade with non-members? How are the allocation and prices of the products purchased from members and the necessities supplied to members stipulated? What problems exist in the cooperative's organization of production, and how does it relate to the production teams? Whether the above issues have been correctly resolved, and how they have been resolved, we hope to see continued reports.

    The Songhou Village Cooperative in Licheng, Taihang, after four years of construction, has now developed into a supply and marketing cooperative supported by the masses. It has played a significant role in improving the lives of the village's farmers and increasing production. The village is a small mountain village in the fourth district of Licheng. The soil is thick and thin, and the income from grain cannot completely solve the problem of life. Before the war, the village's farmers relied on planting Codonopsis pilosula (a medicinal herb) and digging medicinal materials (there are sixty or seventy kinds of medicinal materials in the area) as their main source of income. Most farmers lived a poor life of half bran and vegetables and half grain. The village cooperative was established in November 1944. Initially, 6,200 yuan (Jicha) of capital was raised to open a store. Due to a purely profit-oriented view, with the main purpose of making money and distributing dividends, although it earned 2,800 yuan after three months of operation, the farmers did not support it. In 1946, the cooperative implemented a reform, reviewed the past practice of buying cheap and selling dear like merchants, and proposed promoting the sale of mountain loans of medicinal materials and purchasing daily necessities for members as the cooperative's new tasks. Their approach was to mobilize farmers to dig medicinal materials, plant Codonopsis pilosula, and collect black leaves (used as a dye) in the slack farming season. The cooperative would uniformly purchase these medicinal materials and Codonopsis pilosula, sell them, and exchange them for necessities such as cotton and salt needed by the farmers. According to the statistics in 1946, the total value of digging medicinal materials, collecting black leaves, and exporting Codonopsis pilosula, including the foot price obtained during transportation, was 110 shi and 9 dou of millet, accounting for 21% of the village's total income. In 1947, the value of Codonopsis pilosula was high and the sales were wide, so the cooperative vigorously called on farmers to plant Codonopsis pilosula, and helped solve the difficulty of ginseng seedlings with credit. In this year, the cooperative planted 25 mu itself, and the farmers planted 45 mu. In one year, the output of Codonopsis pilosula reached 3,500 jin, worth 3.85 million yuan, which was equivalent to about 223 shi of millet at the market price at that time. The cooperative established a trade relationship with the Lishun Medicine Shop in Handan City, exported the medicinal materials, and exchanged them for a large number of salt, cotton, and Sichuan and Guangdong medicinal materials. The cooperative supported women's weaving with cotton, lending out a total of 845 jin of cotton, and purchasing 545 pieces of homespun cloth, supporting 55 women's weaving. In addition to supplying farmers in the village, salt, Sichuan and Guangdong medicinal materials were also sold to the Xiangyuanbao Cooperative, and 22,000 jin of coal were exchanged there, and the village's livestock were organized to transport them back. This batch of coal, plus the firewood collected by the village's farmers for one month in winter, solved the village's fuel problem for ten months in 1948. Due to the cooperative's development of supply and marketing business, people's lives have been universally improved and improved. The average total income per person has increased from 1 shi and 2 dou and 4 sheng of refined grain to 2 shi and 1 dou in 1947. The supply and marketing cooperative has played a great role in increasing farmers' income, and agricultural production has been significantly improved. The increase in livestock and sheep has greatly increased the amount of fertilizer applied to the village's crops. Last year, the amount of fertilizer applied per mu reached about 100 loads, and the average yield per mu was 1 shi and 5 dou of coarse grain. At present, the supply and marketing cooperative has a share capital of 2,512,000 yuan and 260 members. Every time there is a meeting, regardless of wind or rain, male and female members always come with lanterns and torches to enthusiastically discuss the cooperative's issues.
    The cooperative has become a well-recognized good cooperative that can connect with the masses in Licheng. The main reasons for its success are the following four points: First, it truly played the role of supply and marketing, centralized the members' products, sold them to the outside at a fair price, and wholesale the members' daily necessities and means of production from the national trade authorities at a slightly lower price than the market price, avoiding the middleman's exploitation. This greatly stimulated and improved the members' production.
    Second, the democratic management of the members was implemented. The business plan was formulated and the work of the supply and marketing cooperative was reviewed through the members' congress. After the congress, the members' groups each elected a representative to form a representative meeting to implement daily supervision of the supply and marketing cooperative, ensuring the frequent contact of the supply and marketing cooperative with the members.
    Third, it has obtained the support of state-owned enterprises. For example, in 1947, when planting Codonopsis pilosula and purchasing ginseng seedlings, the cooperative's 600,000 yuan of funds were insufficient, and it obtained a loan of 400,000 yuan from the Jinan Bank, and the difficulties were solved.
    Fourth, the supply and marketing cooperative is well managed. The leading backbone of the cooperative is strong. The manager, Wu Quanxi, is a Communist Party member. He was elected as a cooperative hero at the Taihang Hero Meeting in 1946. He wholeheartedly serves the people, and there are no bad styles or bad phenomena in the management of cooperative affairs.

　　松后村供销合作社的发展前后
    太行分社
    松后村合作社转变了盲目的追逐利润的经营方针，抓住了合作社业务的中心一环——供销业务。通过供销避免了商人对社员的中间剥削，由于首先把他们的产品推销出去，并能及时供给社员以必需品和生产资料，这就刺激与便利了社员生产的提高。分社报导了松后村合作社的业务成绩，但对于下列问题，尚未涉及。比如：该社是否按供销社原则不分红？是只与社员交易，还是与非社员也进行交易？收购社员的产品，供给社员必需品的配售量与价格是如何规定的？该社组织生产中存有那些问题，与生产小组如何发生业务关系？以上问题是否已正确解决，怎样解决的，望作继续报导。
    　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　——编者
    太行黎城松后村合作社，经过四年的建设，现在已发展成一个群众拥护的供销合作社。对于该村农民生活的改善与生产的提高，起了重大的作用。该村是黎城四区的一个小山庄，石厚土薄，靠粮食收入不能全部解决生活问题。战前该村农民就以栽种党参（药名）、刨药材（该地有药材六七十种）为其生活的主要来源。农民大部分着半年糠菜半年粮过穷苦日子。该村合作社成立于一九四四年十一月。最初，筹集了六千二百元（冀钞下同）本金，开设了一座商店，由于单纯的营利观点，以赚钱分红为主要目的，所以经营了三个月以后，虽赚了二千八百元，但农民不拥护它。到一九四六年这个合作社实行了一次改革，将过去贱买贵卖的商人作法作了检讨，提出为社员推销山贷药材、购买日用必需品为合作社的新任务，他们的做法是在农闲季节，动员农民刨药材，种党参，采黑叶（代染料用），由合作社把这些药材、党参统一收购起来，推销出去，换回农民所需要的棉花、食盐等必需品来。据一九四六年的统计：全村刨药材、采黑叶、输出党参连同运出时所得之脚价，共值小米一百一十石零九斗，占全村总收入的百分之二十一。到一九四七年，党参价值高，销路广，合作社就大力号召农民来栽党参，并以信贷方式帮助解决参秧困难。这年，合作社自种廿五亩，农民种了四十五亩，一年输出党参达三千五百斤，价值三百八十五万元之巨，按当时市价约合小米二百二十三石。合作社和邯郸市的黎顺药栈建立了贸易关系，将药材输出去，换回了大批的食盐、棉花、川广药材。合作社以棉花扶助了妇女纺织，共贷出棉花八百四十五斤，收购土布五百四十五匹，支持了五十五个妇女的纺织。食盐与川广药材，除供给本村农民购买外，还卖给襄垣堡的合作社，又在那里换回煤炭二万二千斤，组织本村牲口运回来，这批煤炭加上该村农民冬季一个月所打的柴，解决了该村一九四八年十个月的饶用问题。由于合作社发展了供销业务，人民生活得到了普遍的改善与提高。每人总收入平均细粮由一石二斗四增到一九四七年的二石一斗。供销社对于增加农民的收入，起了很大作用，农业生产有显著的提高。牲口羊群的增加，大大的增加了该村农作物的施肥数量，去年每亩施肥达一百驮左右，平均每亩能产一石五斗粗粮。目前，这个供销社已有股金二百五十一万二千元，社员二百六十名。每到开会，不管刮风下雨，男女社员总是打着灯笼火把，踊跃地来讨论合作社的问题。
    这个合作社在黎城已成为大家公认的能联系群众的一个好合作社。其成功的主要原因有以下四点：第一、真正发挥了供销的作用，将社员的生产品集中起来，以公道价格向外推销，又将社员的日用必需品与生产资料，从国家贸易机关总批回来，稍低于市价售给社员，避免了商人的中间剥削。大大刺激与提高了社员的生产。
    第二、实行了社员的民主管理。经过社员大会来制定业务计划，检讨供销社的工作。大会闭幕后，社员小组为单位，各选一个代表，组成代表会，实行对供销社的日常监督，保证了供销社对社员的经常联系。
    第三、取得了国家企业的支持。如一九四七年栽党参购买参秧，合作社的六十万元资金不敷应用，获得了冀南银行四十万元的贷款，困难遂迎刃而解。
    第四、供销社经营管理得好。该社领导骨干坚强，经理武全喜是共产党员，一九四六年太行群英会当选为合作英雄，他全心全意为人民服务，在管理社务上，没有坏作风和不良现象。
