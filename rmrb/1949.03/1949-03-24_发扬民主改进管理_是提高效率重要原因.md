　　Promoting Democracy and Improving Management
    Is an Important Reason for Improving Efficiency

    After liberation, the sixteen contractor teams in the Xishan Mine owed workers large amounts of wages and cruelly oppressed them. Guilt-ridden, fifteen of them fled. After I took over, I reorganized the original workers' organizations of the contractor teams into a production team system after discussion with the workers. Each production team elected a leader, and there were three shifts with three shift leaders (or group leaders). They went down the mine to lead production, and everything was discussed clearly by everyone. This guaranteed that the workers' deserved wages were not subject to intermediate exploitation, promoted democracy, and improved management methods, which is also an important reason for improving efficiency. The administrative side of the Xishan Mine and the mine's trade union often cooperated consistently. The Chengzi Mine takeover committee and the mine's trade union also initially paid attention to mutual cooperation, listened to workers' opinions, and improved management. They transformed the antagonistic relationship between the mine management and workers before liberation. The implementation of these measures increased the conditions for increasing production and guaranteed the completion of the production increase task.

    However, there are still some problems in the current increase in production that need to be resolved. (See separate article) (Sun Zhen)

　　发扬民主改进管理
    是提高效率重要原因
    解放后，西山矿的十六个包工柜因为欠工人大批工资，残酷的压迫工人，贼人胆虚，一下跑了十五个。我接管后，就在包工柜原来的工人组织基础上，经过工人讨论改为生产组制度，一个生产组选一个组长，下设三个班，有三个班长（或小组长），他们下井带领生产，一切事大家讨论得明明白白，这样保证了工人应得的工资不受中间剥削，发扬了民主，改进管理办法，这也是提高效率的重要原因。西山矿行政方面与矿工会经常配合一致，城子矿接管委员与矿工会也初步注意了互相结合，听取工人意见改善管理。转变解放前矿方与工人的敌对关系。实现这些措施就增加了提高产量的条件，保证了增产任务的完成。
    但目前增产中，还有一些问题，须要予以解决。（见另文）（孙震）
