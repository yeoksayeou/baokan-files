　　Clearly Distinguish the Enemy from Ourselves
    邺 County Second District Rectifies Militia and Village Cadres
    [Taihang News] The Second District of 邺 County (near Anyang) is rectifying the militia and village cadres. In late last month, a mobilization meeting was held for 175 village cadres and militia members. Through two days of examination, they began to recognize the enemy's plot to buy off village cadres and the masses and to divide our forces. Wang Jincheng, the village chief of Hancun Village, said: "After studying, I realized that the landlord was buying me off." He voluntarily confessed the fact that the landlord Qin Fengming had bribed him and how he was told to shoot at the district office in the dark. He also announced that he would stand firm, work hard, and never be fooled by the landlords again. After collective discussion and analysis, one person was removed from his post, and six people were given warnings. They also formulated disciplines: guaranteeing not to eat the landlord's food, not to spend the landlord's money, not to listen to the landlord's words, and resolutely break with the landlord's family; at the same time, not to eat and drink extravagantly with pseudo-personnel, and not to smoke their cigarettes; to prevent enemy snipers and plainclothes agents, and not to be negligent or careless. According to the village cadres and militia of the district, after three years of guerrilla warfare training, their political awareness has been raised, but some comrades are still inseparable from the landlords, are corrupt and degenerate, and are divorced from the masses. After this rectification, they have further distinguished the enemy from ourselves. Regarding the current work, they decided: to carry out political offensive propaganda, expose the enemy's conspiracies and rumors, and prevent the enemy's various sabotages; at the same time, to rectify the peasants' association and self-defense forces, and actively prepare for war support work.

　　分清敌我界线
    邺县二区整顿民兵村干
    【太行讯】邺县（靠近安阳）二区整顿民兵和村干部。上月下旬曾召开了一百七十五人的村干、民兵动员大会，从两天的检查中，他们开始认清了地主收买村干、群众，分化我们力量的阴谋。韩村村长王进成说：“经过学习、我才认清了地主是收买我。”他自动将地主秦凤鸣收买他的事实及叫他如何到区公所打黑枪等都说了出来。并宣布今后一定要站稳立场、努力工作、再也不上地主的当。经集体讨论分析后，一人被撤职，六人受到警告处分，并订出了纪律：保证不吃地主饭，不花地主钱、不听地主话、坚决和地主分家；同时不和伪人员大吃二喝，不吸他们的烟；防止敌人黑枪便衣，不轻敌麻痹。按该区的村干、民兵，经过三年的游击战争锻炼，政治觉悟提高，但部份同志与地主仍分不开家，贪污腐化、脱离群众，经过这次整顿，都更进一步分清了敌我界限，对当前工作决定：开展政攻宣传，揭露敌人阴谋、谣言，防止敌人各种破坏；同时，整顿农会、自卫队，积极准备战勤工作。
