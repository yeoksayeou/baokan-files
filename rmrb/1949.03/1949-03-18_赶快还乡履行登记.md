A Short Commentary:

　　Hurry Back Home and Register
    The North China People's Government issued the "Measures for the Registration and Management of People Returning to Their Hometowns from Cities" on March 7th, providing arrangements and solutions for various returning personnel, even offering lenient treatment to those who had participated in reactionary organizations. This is a very important measure for maintaining social order in the liberated areas and increasing mass production.
    Due to the long-term rule of reactionary regimes in the cities in the past, the cities were isolated from the vast liberated areas, causing many good citizens (such as laborers and students) to be deceived and forced by reactionaries to wander in the cities, losing their education and jobs. Now, this situation will be a thing of the past in North China. They can freely return, and their hometowns are waiting for them. If they are upright and have nothing to be ashamed of, they should only be happy and have no worries about returning home. They should first actively register with their original government so as to obtain government protection and assistance.
    During the land reform process, many landlords fled to the cities, either because they did not understand our Party's land policy or because they were afraid of being liquidated for their past wrongdoings. In the cities, they lived a life of exile. Although they wanted to return, they had concerns. Now they can also return. They should understand that as long as they bow their heads to the peasants, admit their past mistakes, abide by the laws and decrees of the People's Government, and engage in production and live in peace, they will also be protected after government registration and will be allocated land in accordance with the Outline Land Law. Although they may not be able to get a share in villages where land reform has already been completed because land rights have already been determined, the government will still try to adjust the land or order them to engage in other production to provide appropriate resettlement. As for merchants and small capitalists who fled to the cities because they did not understand our Party's industrial and commercial policies, they should return home and continue their business as soon as they see that private capital in Tianjin and Beijing has been protected.
    The most lenient aspect of the regulation is that it also provides an opportunity for self-renewal for personnel above the district level in reactionary organizations. Most of these people were enemies of the people in the past and were hated by everyone. They should have been punished according to the law, but today, as long as they register with the local county public security bureau, repent and rehabilitate themselves, guarantee that they will no longer have any relationship with reactionary organizations, conscientiously abide by the laws and decrees of the People's Government, and engage in production and live in peace, they can still be treated leniently based on the specific circumstances. The People's Liberation Army Declaration has long stipulated that for enemy personnel: "The ringleaders must be punished, the coerced are not questioned, and the meritorious are rewarded." Therefore, they only have two futures: either register according to the law and be treated leniently, or do not register, unwilling to give up their reactionary position and activities, and will be severely punished. They can choose for themselves. To those who attempt to use returning home to carry out counter-revolutionary activities, we would like to issue a warning in advance: it must be understood that the broad masses of the people in the liberated areas have long been tempered by revolution, are highly vigilant, and are highly organized, and all your reactionary attempts will be met with crushing blows.
    As for the disbanded prisoners of war and scattered soldiers, many had already returned to their hometowns and were able to live in peace after the liberation of various small and medium-sized cities in the past. They are generally from poor working-class backgrounds, were conscripted into the army by the reactionaries, and suffered oppression. After being liberated and disbanded by the People's Liberation Army, they should return to their hometowns to register, get rid of their bad habits, and engage in production in peace. As for the Kuomintang officers and soldiers who participated in the peaceful liberation of Beiping and voluntarily returned to their hometowns, they have been given various preferential treatments and have been issued with other certificates; after returning to their hometowns, they should actively abide by the law and each live according to their own duties.
    The broad masses of the people in the liberated areas have suffered various persecutions from the Kuomintang reactionary army and personnel of reactionary organizations in the past. Now, they do not investigate the past and help the government resettle various returning personnel. Their great spirit is admirable. They can all understand the government's policies and have made great efforts to resettle returning personnel in the past. Therefore, every returning person should respect the people at all times, work hard to improve themselves, and especially those who have been enemies of the people should reflect deeply and restrain themselves. As long as you conscientiously abide by the laws and decrees of the People's Government, the people will not discriminate and will help you live and work in peace; but if you violate the laws and decrees, are unwilling to register, or even continue to engage in activities that endanger the people, you will be reported and sanctioned by the people. Because every person knows that maintaining order in the liberated areas is everyone's responsibility.
    In short, this regulation of the North China People's Government will enable those who return to their hometowns to find their place, determine their own future according to their performance, protect those who register according to the law, and ensure that the long-established social order in the liberated areas will not be disrupted by their return. This is why it is necessary to register and manage personnel returning to their hometowns. It is hoped that all returning personnel will comply without fail; it is hoped that those who should return to their hometowns but are wavering and hesitating will make up their minds and register immediately.

### 赶快还乡履行登记

　　赶快还乡履行登记
    华北人民政府三月七日发布了离城还乡人员登记管理办法，对于各种还乡人员，均分别给以安置与出路，即对曾经参加反动组织的分子，也宽大处理。这对于维持解放区社会秩序，增加群众生产，是一个非常重要的措施。
    由于过去反动政权长期统治城市，造成城市和广大解放区的隔绝，使许多善良公民（如劳动者及学生等）为反动派欺骗强迫，流落城市，失学失业。现在，这种情况在华北将永远成为过去了。他们可以自由地回去，他们的家乡在等待着他们。他们自己，平日为人正派，问心无愧，对于还乡，当只有高兴，没有顾虑。他们应该首先积极向原籍政府登记，以便取得政府的保护与帮助。
    土地改革的过程中，许多地主或因不明了我们党的土地政策，或因平日作恶多端害怕清算，逃到城市，在城市里，过着流亡的生活。他们虽想回去，但又有顾虑，现在也可以回去了。他们应该明了，只要向农民低头，承认过去错误，遵守人民政府法令，安心生产度日，经过政府登记以后，也在被保护之列，并将依据土地法大纲，分得土地。虽则在土改业已完成的村庄，由于地权业已确定，未必准能分得一份，但政府仍将设法调剂土地，或令其从事其他生产，予以适当安置。至于因不了解我党工商业政策而逃往城市的商人、小资本家等，只要一看平津的私人资本业已受到保护，即应该回家继续经营生意。
    该规定特别宽大之处，是对于反动组织的区级以上人员，也都给以自新的出路。这一种人，过去大多与民为敌，人人痛恨，本应依法惩办，今天也只要向所属县公安局登记，悔过自新，并保证今后再不与反动组织发生任何关系，切实遵守人民政府法令，安心生产度日，仍可根据具体情况，从宽处理。人民解放军宣言上，早已规定，对于敌方人员：“首恶者必办，胁从者不问，立功者受赏。”因此他们只有两个前途：或是依法登记，从宽处理；或是不去登记，不愿放弃反动立场与活动，则将严惩不贷。何去何从，当可自择。对于企图利用还乡，以进行反革命活动者，我们愿在此先行提出警告：须知解放区的广大人民都是久经革命锻炼，警觉性极高，组织性极强的，你们的一切反动企图，均将遭到粉碎的打击。
    至于遣散之俘虏与散兵游勇，过去在解放各中小城市时，早已不少还乡，得以安生度日。他们大体是贫苦劳动者出身，被反动派抓壮丁入营，身受压迫，既经人民解放军解放遣散，即应返乡登记，革除恶习，安心生产。至于此次参加北平和平解放而自愿还乡的国民党官兵，则已多方优待，另发证件；返乡以后，更应积极守法，各安本分。
    解放区的广大人民，曾经遭受过国民党反动军队与反动组织人员的各种迫害，现在不究既往，并帮助政府安置各种返乡人员，他们的伟大气魄与精神，是值得敬佩的。他们都能了解政府的政策，过去即曾为安置返乡人员尽过极大努力，所以每一个返乡人员，应该随时尊重人民，刻苦自励，特别是曾经与民为敌的人，更应深刻反省，自加约束。只要你们切实遵守人民政府法令，人民即会不加歧视，并帮助你们安居乐业；但若违犯法令，不愿登记，甚或继续从事危害人民的活动，则必被人民检举与制裁。因为每个人民都知道维持解放区的秩序，是人人应尽的责任。
    总之，华北人民政府这一规定，将使还乡者各得其所，依其表现而决定自己的前途，将使依法登记的人得到保护，将使久已安定的解放区社会秩序，不致因他们还乡而被扰乱。这就是为什么要进行还乡人员登记管理的原因。希望各还乡人员，遵行无违；希望应该还乡而在动摇犹豫的人，赶快拿定主意，立刻登记。
