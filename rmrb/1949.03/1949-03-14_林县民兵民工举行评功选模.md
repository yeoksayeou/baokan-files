[Taixing Telegram] The Lin County militia and laborers, who worked with the Yubei People's Liberation Army on the front lines for more than a month, enthusiastically launched a campaign to earn merits. In early February, they held a summary meeting for merit evaluation and model selection. Among the 1,500 militia and laborers in the county, 261 heroes emerged, including stretcher bearers Zhai Chengtai and Ge Chunhe, and militia members Chen Jingzhong and Fu Shoujiang. In addition to issuing certificates of merit to each person, the Yubei Logistics Command awarded a large red flag, 68 pairs of shoes, and 85 towels. The Yubei combat troops awarded 17 rifles. Due to their strict organization, good discipline, and ability to resolutely complete tasks, they were awarded the glorious title of "Three Goods" by the troops. For example, Comrade Fu Shoujiang, the leader of the militia's first company, led a squad to Jixian with the troops. When enemy activity occurred on the road and a unit of the column headquarters lost contact with the troops, they immediately formed a strong security team. Even when the gunfire was intense, the sentries insisted on staying at their posts, calmly monitoring the enemy and protecting the safety of the column headquarters. When the battle began, Comrade Fu Shoujiang accepted the task of concentrating 30 stretchers on the spot. He personally led the militia to mobilize the people, and successfully completed the task in half a day. During the Hui County battle, they were still responsible for delivering 104 stretchers to Shanxi. Having lost contact with the troops for a long time, some laborers were hesitant to move forward. They patiently persuaded and mobilized them, and finally found the troops the next morning, with no one left behind. Guo Huikou, a laborer from the third squadron of the third brigade of stretcher bearers, braved the enemy's fire blockade twice during the Hui County battle to carry back two wounded soldiers. The first detachment of the second squadron of the fourth brigade was preparing to eat breakfast when they suddenly received an order to repair the road at Pingbao. Each detachment volunteered to participate, and all members immediately set off and quickly paved the blockade ditch, which was waist-deep in water, into a flat road, allowing the troops to pass safely and complete the task of annihilating the enemy. Laborer Feng Zhulin carried ammunition to the front line twice in one night, and led stretchers to rescue two wounded soldiers on his return. Zhai Taicheng, a 58-year-old laborer, took off his cotton coat to cover the wounded soldiers, fearing that they would be frozen, which influenced others to cover the wounded with quilts and clothes. When marching, he did not rest when others rested, but helped the cooks carry water and cook, and watched the house while others ate, demonstrating a high degree of friendship and mutual assistance. The Lin County militia and laborers' model spirit of strictly observing discipline spread throughout the front lines, and the relationship between the army and the people was excellent. Whenever there was a gap, they helped the masses with production, delivering manure, and chiseling mills, and conducted propaganda work among the masses. Most of the manure in Dayangdi Village, Xinxiang, was delivered to the fields by two squadrons of the fourth brigade of stretcher bearers. Many villagers said, "No wonder the People's Liberation Army can win battles. Not only are the soldiers good, but the stretcher bearers are also so good. We have never seen anything like this before."

　　林县民兵民工举行评功选模
    【太行电】林县民兵、民工，随豫北人民解放军在前线工作月余中，曾热烈展开立功运动。二月初，他们召开了评功选模总结大会，全县民兵、民工一千五百人中，涌现出担架民工翟成太、葛春和及民兵陈京仲、傅守江等二百六十一名功臣。豫北后勤司令部除每人发给奖状一纸外，并奖大红旗一面，鞋六十八双，毛巾八十五条。豫北作战部队奖给步枪十七枝。由于他们的组织严密，纪律良好，能坚决完成任务，获得了部队送给“三好”的光荣称号。如民兵一连长傅守江同志，带领一个班与部队向汲县进发时，路上发生敌情，某纵直属队与部队失掉联系，他们便立即组成了一支强有力的警卫工作队，在枪声响的很激烈时，岗哨仍在坚持着没有离开岗位，沉着地监视敌人，保护了纵直属的安全。战斗开始，傅守江同志接受了就地集中三十付担架的任务，自己即带领民兵亲自深入动员，在半天时间内把任务顺利的完成了。在辉县战斗时，他们仍担负着将一百零四付担架送到山西的任务，久与部队失掉联系，一些民工畏缩不前，他们耐心的说服动员，终于在第二天早上找到了部队，结果无一人掉队。担架三大队三中队民工郭会岣，在辉县战斗中，两次冲过敌人的火力封锁线，抢背下两个伤员。四大队二中队一分队，做好早饭正准备要吃，忽接到平堡修路命令，各分队自报奋勇参加，全体队员当即出发很快的将水深及腰的封锁沟铺平成一条坦平的道路，使部队安全的通过，完成了歼灭敌人的任务。民工冯竹林一夜两次背着弹药送到火线上，返回时还带领担架抢救回伤员二名。五十八岁的翟太成民工，怕冻着彩号伤口，脱下自己的棉衣给伤员盖上，影响了别人也都给伤员铺盖被子衣服；行军时，别人休息，他不休息，帮助伙夫担水做饭，别人吃饭他看家，发挥了高度的友爱互助精神。林县民兵、民工的严守纪律的模范精神盛传前线，军民关系搞得很好，一有空隙就帮助群众生产、送粪、凿磨，并向群众做宣传工作。新乡大阳堤村的粪，大部是担架民工四大队两个中队给送到地里的，许多老乡都说：“怪不得解放军能打胜仗，不光是当兵的好，担架的民夫也是这样好，过去真没见过。”
