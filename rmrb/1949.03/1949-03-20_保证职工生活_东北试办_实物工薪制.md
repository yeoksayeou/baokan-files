　　Guaranteeing Workers' Livelihood
  　Northeast Pilots "In-Kind Wage System"
    [Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 18th] The practice of having worker cooperatives responsible for supplying workers' daily necessities to effectively implement the "in-kind wage system" has been successfully piloted in some state-owned enterprises in Northeast China. The implementation of this method allows workers' wages to be unaffected by wartime price fluctuations and allows them to obtain goods cheaper than on the market. In terms of enterprise administration, the procedures for issuing wages are also greatly simplified. The Northeast Second Textile Factory Workers' Cooperative Council first conducted a survey of each worker's daily necessities to understand the needs of workers and their families, as a basis for the cooperative's purchase of food. After wage settlement, workers can take the work point account issued by the factory authorities (one "point" is calculated based on the total value of 1.63 jin of local mixed grain, 5.5 jin of coal, 0.035 jin of soybean oil, 0.045 jin of kelp, and 0.2 square feet of white Liberation cloth, and each worker's work point account is issued according to the number of points each person should receive), and then go to the cooperative to receive purchase tickets and buy whatever they need. Workers are all satisfied with this method. The cooperative is now trying its best to purchase more goods, of which daily necessities alone have reached 102 kinds. The Harbin Municipal Workers' Consumer Cooperative also piloted the above-mentioned business in January. The municipal government system's state-owned enterprises have a total of 7,500 employees, with a total monthly wage of 740,000 points. The cooperative absorbed 1.177 billion yuan as working capital from the municipal finance bureau, banks, and employee shares, and issued 7,500 in-kind wage adjustment tickets (20 points per ticket) based on the available supply of goods. In the first nine days, more than 5,500 workers went to the cooperative to exchange goods, with a value of more than 109,000 points. The amount saved by workers due to the selling price being lower than the market price reached more than 70 million yuan, while the cooperative itself made a profit of about 10 million yuan per month at an interest rate of 1%. Due to the success of this pilot program, all state-owned enterprises under the city's jurisdiction have had the cooperative issue in-kind wages on their behalf since February. The cooperative is now actively mobilizing all employees to buy shares in order to expand working capital, increase turnover, and gradually increase the supply of goods from 20 points per person to the majority and even all of the required goods.

  　东北试办“实物工薪制”
    【新华社沈阳十八日电】经过职工合作社负责供应职工生活日用品，以有效实施“实物工薪制”，已在东北某些公营企业中试办成功。这一办法的实施，可使职工所得工薪不受战时物价波动影响，并得到较市场便宜的物品。在企业行政方面，发放工薪的手续亦大为简便。东北第二纺织厂职工合作社理事会曾事先发给每个职工生活日用品调查后，了解职工及其家属的需要，作为合作社购买食物的根据。工薪结算后，职工持工厂当局所发的工分帐（按一“分”系按当地混合粮一·六三斤，煤五·五斤，豆油零·零三五斤，海带零·零四五斤，白解放布零·二方尺的总值计算，每个职工的工分帐即按每人应得的分数发给），即可到合作社领取购买票，随意买他所需要的东西。职工对这一办法均感满意。该社现正尽力添购物品，其中仅日用品一项即已达一百零二种。哈尔滨市职工消费合作社亦于一月份试办了上述业务。该市政府系统所属各公营企业共有职工七千五百名，每月工资总额为七十四万分。该社即由市财政局、银行及职工入股中吸收了十一亿七千余万元作流动资金，根据可能供应的实物力量，发出工薪实物调剂票七千五百张（每张二十分）。在最初九天之内，到合作社调换实物的职工即有五千五百余人，供应实物的数值为十万九千余分。其中因售价低于市价而为职工节省的金额即达七千余万元，而合作社本身以百分之一的利率一个月营利约一千余万元。由于此项试办成功，该市所属各公营企业自二月份起即由该合作社代为发放实物工薪。现该合作社正积极动员全体职工入股，以便扩大流动金额，增加周转，达到从每人供应二十分逐渐增加到供应大部以至全部所需实物。
