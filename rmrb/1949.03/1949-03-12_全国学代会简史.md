Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 9th. A brief history of the All-China Student Congress. The text is as follows: The Student Congress held in Beiping from the 1st to the 6th of this month is the 14th All-China Student Congress. Modern Chinese students began to organize their own national groups with the "May Fourth" Movement. On May 6, 1919, the third day after the outbreak of the "May Fourth" Movement, middle school and university students in Beiping formally established the "Beijing Secondary and Higher Education Student Union." By May 16th, student representatives from all over the country gathered in Shanghai to hold the first All-China Student Congress. At this conference, the All-China Student Union Federation, the leading body of the Chinese student movement, was established. From 1919 to 1928, the All-China Student Union Federation held nine national student congresses under the persecution of various counter-revolutionary forces. Among them, the fifth congress held in Guangzhou in 1923 passed resolutions such as overthrowing the warlords. The sixth congress was held under the leadership of the Chinese youth leader and revolutionary martyr Yun Daiying. The seventh congress was held in Shanghai under the leadership of Ren Bishi, the current member of the CPC Central Committee and Director of the Preparatory Committee of the Chinese New Democratic Youth League. In these ten years, Chinese students bravely participated in the Chinese anti-imperialist and anti-feudal revolutionary struggles. The "May 30th" Movement of 1925 was one example of the heroic struggle of Chinese students. In October 1929, the Kuomintang Central Training Department ordered the All-China Student Union Federation to cease its activities. It was not until after the outbreak of the "September 18th" Incident in 1931 and the "January 28th" Incident in 1932 that the Chinese student movement entered a new upsurge. The vigorous "December 9th" Movement broke out in the winter of 1935. In the spring of 1936, another National Student Congress was held in Shanghai, re-establishing the China Student Union and demanding the launch of a full-scale war of resistance. This conference should be listed as the 11th All-China Student Congress. In the summer of 1938, the China Student Union held a National Student Congress in Wuhan, advocating persisting in the war of resistance to the end and opposing compromise and surrender. In June 1947, student representatives from all over the country gathered in Shanghai to launch the anti-hunger and anti-civil war movement. These two conferences were the 12th and 13th All-China Student Congresses. Now, on the eve of the victory of the Chinese People's Democratic Revolution, student representatives from all over the country have gathered in Beiping, the birthplace of the "May Fourth" Movement, to hold this unprecedented grand event, the 14th Congress.

　　全国学代会简史
    【新华社陕北九日电】中华全国学生代表大会历史简述。文如下：本月一日至六日在北平召开的学生代表大会是中华全国学生第十四届代表大会。现代的中国学生组织自己的全国性的团体开始于“五四”运动。一九一九年五月六日，即“五四”运动爆发以后的第三天，北平的大、中学生正式成立了“北京中等以上学校学生联合会”。到了五月十六日，全国各地学生代表齐集上海，举行了中华全国学生第一届代表大会。在这次大会上，产生了中国学生运动的领导机关中华民国学生联合会总会。从一九一九年到一九二八年的十年当中，中华民国学生联合会总会在各种反革命势力的迫害下，先后召开过九届全国学生代表大会，其中一九二三年在广州召开的第五届代表大会，曾经通过了打倒军阀等决议案。第六届代表大会是在中国青年领袖、革命先烈惮代英领导之下召开的。第七届代表大会则是由现任中共中央委员、中国新民主主义青年团筹备委员会主任任弼时领导下在上海举行。在这十年中，中国学生英勇地参加了中国反帝、反封建的革命斗争。一九二五年的“五卅”运动，便是中国学生英勇斗争的范例之一。一九二九年十月，国民党中央训练部便勒令中华民国学生联合会总会停止活动。直到一九三二年“九一八”和一九三二年“一二八”的抗日斗争开始后，中国学生运动又进入了新的高潮。一九三五年冬天爆发了轰轰烈烈的“一二九”运动。一九三六年春天乃在上海召开了另一次全国学生代表大会，重新成立中国学生联合会，要求发动全面抗战。这一次大会应列为中华全国学生第十一届代表大会。一九三八年夏天，中国学生联合会在武汉召开全国学生代表大会，主张坚持抗战到底，反对妥协投降。一九四七年六月，全国各地学生代表在上海集会，开展反饥饿、反内战运动。这两次大会是中华全国学生第十二届和第十三届代表大会。现在，在中国人民民主革命胜利前夕，全国学生代表又在“五四”运动发祥地北平召开这一次空前的盛会即第十四届大会。
