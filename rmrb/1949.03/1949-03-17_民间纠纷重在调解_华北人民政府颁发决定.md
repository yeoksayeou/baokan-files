　　Focus on Mediation in Civil Disputes
  　Decision Issued by the North China People's Government
    [Reported by this newspaper] The North China People's Government recently issued a decision regarding the mediation of civil disputes, the original text of which is as follows:
    1. Importance of Mediation: Over the years, our North China Liberated Area has advocated mediation for civil cases and minor criminal cases. In some counties, over 70% of civil disputes have been resolved through mediation, and even more in some villages and districts. This demonstrates that our mediation work has played a significant role in strengthening the unity of the people, sparing them the financial and time costs of litigation, and enabling them to devote more effort to production and supporting the front lines. However, some deviations have occurred in mediation: for example, some local cadres have stipulated that mediation is a mandatory stage before litigation, prohibiting lawsuits without prior mediation; some district and village officials have even forced parties to comply with mediation decisions by refusing to issue letters of introduction, and some counties have refused to accept cases without such letters. This transforms mediation into coercion and infringes upon the people's freedom to litigate, which is wrong and should be immediately abolished.
    Mediation is part of the people's democratic life. If matters that can be mediated are successfully mediated, it not only preserves harmony, saves money, and reduces work delays, but also provides a great educational significance by calmly and rationally discussing and distinguishing right from wrong. Mutual concessions or assistance in mediation can change people's narrow-minded thinking; these are all benefits of mediation. These aspects must also be noted in order to maximize the role of mediation. The government should commend those who are good at mediation work.
    2. Organization of Mediation: The conduct of mediation should first rely on impartial relatives, friends, neighbors, and village cadres of both parties involved. They are relatively clear about the matter and have closer relationships, and if they have correct viewpoints, they can often eliminate disputes at the outset and often do so appropriately.
    Second, government mediation: District and village governments should accept requests from the people for mediation. To carry out this work, the village government should establish a mediation committee, whose members may be elected by the village people's representative assembly or recommended by the village government committee. However, the village chairman must be a member of the committee or concurrently serve as the director. Depending on the workload, the district office may establish a mediation assistant or a mediation committee. The district mediation committee shall have the district head as the director, and the members shall be representatives of mass organizations or individuals with prestige among the masses appointed by the district office.
    Third, cases that have been filed with the county judicial organs may also be mediated if deemed necessary. The methods are: first, court mediation, in which both parties are advised in court to reconcile and end the lawsuit; second, appointing people trusted by both parties to mediate outside the court; third, the judge convening local people at relevant locations to reason together, so as to find a settlement that both parties can accept, which is both mediation and trial.
    3. Scope of Mediation: All civil cases may be mediated. However, legal mandatory provisions must not be violated. (Mandatory provisions: such as laws and regulations prohibiting the sale and purchase of marriage, prohibiting early marriage, prohibiting rents or interest exceeding the prescribed limits, etc.) For criminal cases, except for those that seriously harm national and social public security and personal rights and interests, mediation may be conducted for other general minor criminal cases.
    Mediation should focus on persuasion and reconciliation, but necessary disposal methods must also be proposed based on policies and regulations. For example, with regard to civil compensation or waivers, minor criminal admissions of guilt, and the payment of consolation money, etc., are appropriate; "muddying the waters" without principle is wrong. However, people should not be forced to comply. Those who insist on not complying should be tried according to the law.
    If the mediation exceeds the scope, mediating what should not be mediated, or the handling is inappropriate, and the county judicial organ orders correction or revocation, the mediator or agency and both parties must comply and not disobey. To this end, governments at all levels should regularly check the mediation work of their subordinates to prevent deviations and help mediators summarize experience and improve their work.
    Previous promulgated mediation regulations that do not conflict with this decision remain valid.
    The above decision also applies to cities. It is hoped that governments at all levels will study and implement it, and that they will collect good and bad examples of mediation, summarize experiences, create new methods, and report to us at any time.

### 民间纠纷重在调解　华北人民政府颁发决定

　　民间纠纷重在调解
  　华北人民政府颁发决定
    【本报讯】华北人民政府最近关于调解民间纠纷的决定，原文如下：
    一、调解的重要：历年来，我华北解放区对于民事案件及轻微刑事案件倡导调解，民间纠纷因调解而解决的，有的县占全部案件百分之七十以上，有的村区甚至更多。这说明了我们的调解工作对于加强人民团结，免去人民因讼事而伤财费时，使能用更多力量从事于生产支前，起了相当大的作用。但在调解中也曾发生了一些偏差：如有的地方干部把调解规定成为诉讼必经的阶段，不经调解不许起诉；甚至当事人不服调解，而区村以不写介绍信强使服从，县也以无介绍信而不受理。这是将调解变成为强迫与侵害人民的诉讼自由，是错误的，应即废止。
    调解是人民的民主生活之一部份。凡可以调解之事，如调解好了，不只保全和气，不费钱，少误工，而且平心静气的讲理，辨明是非，教育的意义很大；调解中有互让或互助，可以改变人们的狭隘思想，这都是调解的好处。也必须注意到这些方面，才能发挥调解的作用。善于作调解工作的人，政府应予以表扬。
    二、调解的组织：调解的进行，首先应依靠公正的双方当事者的亲友邻居及村干部。他们对事情比较清楚，关系又较密切，如果能有正确的观点，常能于纠纷开始时即使之消弭，且也常做得恰当。
    其次是政府调解：区村政府应接受人民调解的请求。为进行此项工作，村政府应设调解委员会，委员由村人民代表会选举或村政府委员会推举均可，但村主席须是当然委员或兼任主任委员。区公所依工作繁简，可设调解助理员，或设调解委员会。区调解委员会以区长为主任委员，委员则由区公所聘请群众团体代表或在群众中有威信的人士充当。
    第三、已起诉到县司法机关的案子，如认为必要，也可以调解。其方式：一是法庭调解，在法庭上劝导双方和解息讼；二是指定双方所信任的人在庭外调解；三是审判员到有关地点召集当地群众，大家评理，借以找出双方都能接受的和解办法，是调解也是审判。
    三、调解的范围：凡民事案件，均得进行调解。但不得违反法律上之强制规定。（强制规定：如法令禁止卖买婚姻、禁止早婚、禁止超过规定的租金或利息等。）凡刑事案件，除损害国家社会公共治安及损害个人权益较重者，不得进行调解外，其余一般轻微刑事案件，亦得进行调解。
    调解以劝说和解为主，但也必须依据政策法令提出必要的处置办法。如关于民事之赔偿或让免，轻微刑事之认错，给抚慰金等，方为妥当；无原则的“和稀泥”，是不对的。但不应强人服从。其有坚持不服者，应即依法进行审判。
    调解如逾越范围，不应调解的也调解了，或者处理的不适当，经县司法机关指令纠正或撤消时，调解人或机关及双方当事者均应服从，不得违抗。为此，各级政府应经常检查所属调解工作，防止偏差。并帮助调解人总结经验，提高工作。
    以前颁布的调解条例，与本决定不抵触者仍有效。
    上述决定，也适用于城市，望各级政府研究执行，并望收集调解的好坏例子，总结经验，创造新的方法，随时报告我们。
    民国三十八年二月二十五日
