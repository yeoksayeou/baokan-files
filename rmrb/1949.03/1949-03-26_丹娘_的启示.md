　　The Inspiration of "Zoya"
　　Yan Jing University Wang Dingchang

　　Far and near is a field of silvery white. In the swirling wind and snow, at the barbed wire of an advanced position of the invading German bandits, a greyish-white body lies supine; wriggling, using a large pair of scissors to cut through the thick barbed wire woven in a crisscross pattern, one strand at a time, the movements so nimble and skilled. Unfortunately, all this was glimpsed by a well-equipped German jackal, which suddenly pounced and seized: a delicate-looking young Soviet female guerrilla fighter. She was so angry and fearless, her firm gaze radiating an unassailable character.

　　She is Zoya: the epitome of millions of righteous and unyielding, outstanding Soviet sons and daughters in this great Soviet Patriotic War - the heroine of the film.

　　Love for the motherland and the leader, the belief in victory, and noble and conscious discipline supported this brave and accomplished young guerrilla fighter. From being arrested and interrogated, to being insulted and intimidated, to being subjected to cruel torture, to wading through wind and snow, and finally stepping onto the open-air gallows, she, Zoya, finally died unyieldingly; and died so solemnly, so purely, except for cursing and hating the barbaric invaders, she did not reveal even half a secret. - Didn't she? When Zoya faced death, she still kept thinking of the future great counter-offensive, thinking of the people of the motherland and their great leader - Marshal Stalin!

　　The story is so ordinary: it only depicts a small aspect of the countless heroic deeds in the sacred Soviet patriotic war; but it is so great: it profoundly depicts how the Soviet people gloriously sacrificed their precious lives to defend the socialist motherland. And what is especially great is that the film gives the broad audience a firm belief: the Soviet people's determination to defend democracy and peace. They have completely sufficient will and strength to defeat and restrain the resurgence of all ambitious world aggressors.

　　But where does all this great strength come from?

　　The film uses a flashback technique to narrate the history of Zoya and all the happy Soviet people's growth: she (they) grew up happily from childhood in a fair and reasonable society, nurtured by the Party of Lenin and Stalin, in the embrace of the vast and rich motherland, she (they) were cultivated by progressive socialist education, and from childhood developed a nature of loving democracy and peace and hating aggressive wars. Therefore, once there are ambitious international aggressors who intend to harm her (their) beautiful and peaceful life with military and barbaric means, she (they) will quickly unite closely and powerfully, and unreservedly beat all ambitious aggressors into the ground: never to be reborn - this is why in the early days of the Soviet Patriotic War, the Soviet people's armed forces - the Red Army - were able to resist the absolutely superior Hitler bandits, and finally strengthen their own strength, completely defeat the fascist Axis aggressors, and rebuild the peaceful motherland, which is also the source of all the great national strength of the Soviet Union today.

　　The course of history has determined the changes in the world's political situation. Yesterday's allies have now become ferocious and evil, more ambitious than Hitler back then! Today, the world's capitalist aggressors, headed by US imperialism, are trying in vain to avoid their historical collapse and are issuing desperate war howls. They are afraid of the awakening and liberation of all the oppressed people in the world, and even more afraid of the protector of lasting peace for mankind: socialist Soviet Union, and they fantasize about launching an aggressive war in the distant future to extinguish human reason and stifle all progressive forces in the world. But the fact of "Zoya" tells us: the unparalleled power of the Soviet Union and the eternal truth that "victory belongs to the people who love peace." What's more, today all the awakened and awakening peace-loving people and countries in the world are closely united around the Soviet Union, and our people's strength is even stronger and broader! We have completely sufficient will and strength to stop all reactionary conspiracies of international warmongers shouting for positions, and thoroughly beat them to a pulp!

　　“丹娘”的启示
    燕京大学  王鼎昌
    远近是一片银白的原野。风雪霏霏中，侵苏德寇的一处前沿阵地的铁丝网下，仰卧着一段灰白的躯体；蠕动着，用一把大剪刀，将交叉织成的粗大的铁丝网一根根地剪断，动作是那样的敏捷与熟练。不幸，这一切让一匹装备优良的德国豺狼瞥见了，蓦地里猛扑上去，攫住了：一位面貌娟秀的苏联青年女游击队员。她是如此地愤怒与无畏，坚定的眼光闪烁着禀然不可侵犯的品格。
    她就是丹娘：在这次伟大的苏联卫国战争中，千百万正义不屈的、苏维埃优秀儿女的缩影——片中的女主角。
    对于祖国和领袖的热爱，必胜的信念，和高贵而自觉的纪律，支持了这位英勇的有成绩的青年游击队员。从被捕而审讯，而污辱恐吓，而酷刑拷打，而跋＠风雪，而最后踏上了露天的绞台，她，丹娘，终于忠贞不屈地死了；而且死得那么庄严，那么纯洁，除了对野蛮侵略者底怒骂与愤恨之外，连半点秘密也不曾泄露。——不是吗？丹娘临难的时候，还念念不忘地惦着未来的大反攻，惦着祖国的人民和他们伟大的领袖——斯大林大元帅！
    故事是这样的平凡：它仅仅描写了神圣的苏联爱国战争中，无数英雄事迹底渺小的一面；但又是这样的伟大：它深入地刻划了苏联人民为了捍卫社会主义的祖国，怎样光荣地献出了自己宝贵的生命。而尤其伟大的，则是片中给予广大的观众以一个坚定的信念：苏联人民保卫民主和平的决心。他们有完全足够的意志与力量，来打败并抑制那一切野心底世界侵略者的再起。
    然而这一切伟大的力量是何从得来的呢？
    片中用倒叙的手法，叙述了丹娘和一切幸福底苏联人民的成长史：她（他）们从小生活在公平合理的社会上，在列宁、斯大林党的抚育下、在广阔丰饶的祖国怀抱里，快乐地长大，她（他）们被进步的社会主义教育栽培着，从孩童时代就养成了爱好民主和平，憎恨侵略战争的天性。所以一旦有野心的国际侵略者，意图用武力野蛮的方式来危害她（他）们美满的和平生活时，她（他）们就会紧密有力地迅速团结起来，毫无保留的把一切野心的侵略者打入地下：永世不得再生——这就是为什么当苏联爱国战争初期，苏联人民的武装——红军——能够抗击着绝对优势的希特勒匪徒们，并最后壮大了自己的实力，彻底打垮法西斯轴心侵略者，重建和平的祖国底原因，也就是今天苏联一切伟大的国力底源泉。
    历史的进程，规定了世界政治风云的变化。昔日的同盟者，现在却变成穷凶极恶，赛过当年希魔的野心家了！今天，以美帝为首的世界资本主义侵略者，正妄图幸免其历史的倾复而发出绝望的战争狂吠。他们害怕全世界所有被压迫人民的觉醒与解放，更害怕人类永久和平的保护者：社会主义的苏联而幻想在遥远的将来，发动一个扑灭全人类理性的侵略战争，来扼杀世界上一切进步的力量。但“丹娘”的事实，却告诉了我们：苏联国力的无比强大和“胜利属于爱好和平的人民”这个永恒的真理。更何况今天世界上一切觉醒了与觉醒着的爱好和平的人民与国家，都紧紧地团结在苏联的周围，我们人民的力量是更加强大壮阔了！我们有完全足够的意志与力量来制止一切国际战争贩子叫嚣求职的反动阴谋，并澈底将它们打得落花流水！
