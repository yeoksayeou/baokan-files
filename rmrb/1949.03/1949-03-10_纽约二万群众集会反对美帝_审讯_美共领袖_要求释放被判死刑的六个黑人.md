　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, March 8th: TASS, New York, March 4th: The Committee for the Protection of Democratic Rights held a mass rally in New York attended by 20,000 people to protest the illegal "trial" of US Communist leaders. The rally condemned the "trial" of the US Communist leaders as a fascist action, intending to strike at the rising international peace movement based on friendly cooperation with the Soviet Union, and resolved to send letters to Attorney General Clark and Judge Medina, demanding the immediate cancellation of the illegal "trial" of the US Communist leaders. One of the accused US Communist leaders, Potash, leader of the Fur and Leather Workers Union, delivered a speech at the rally, which was met with enthusiastic applause from the audience. Another accused US Communist leader, Thompson, chairman of the New York State Communist Party, declared: The Truman government wants to declare the Communist Party "illegal" and then attack all parties that oppose the government's war plans. Sociologist Crick said: The current trial is the last struggle to stop the true democratic movement. The famous artist Kent said: The time has come for all Americans, regardless of political affiliation, to defend the rights of the US Communist Party in order to prevent their own rights from being destroyed. Other speakers denounced the jury system held by the wealthy and their lackeys. Afterwards, the chairman of the rally, Strauss, a representative of the Fur and Leather Workers Union, called on the participants to hold a demonstration in front of the Federal Courthouse on March 7 (the day the "trial" of the US Communist leaders continues). The rally also resolved to send a letter to the Governor of New Jersey, Driscoll, demanding the unconditional release of six black people who were sentenced to death for fabricated "murder."

　　纽约二万群众集会反对美帝“审讯”美共领袖
    要求释放被判死刑的六个黑人
    【新华社陕北八日电】塔斯社纽约四日讯：争取民主权利委员会在纽约召开有二万人参加的反对非法“审讯”美共领袖的群众大会。大会谴责对于美共领袖的“审讯”是法西斯行动，意图打击日益高涨的以对苏合作友善为基础的国际和平运动，并决议致函司法部长克拉克及法官麦迪纳，要求立即撤销对美共领袖的非法“审讯”。被控告的美共领袖之一，产联毛皮工会领袖鲍达希在大会上发表演说，博得听众热烈的鼓掌。另一个被控告的美共领袖纽约州共产党主席汤普逊宣称：杜鲁门政府想把共产党定为“非法”，并进而打击一切反对政府战争计划的党派。社会学家克里可讲道：现在的审讯乃是企图阻止真民主运动的最后挣扎。著名的艺术家肯特说：一切美国人不分政治派别，必须保卫美共权利，以防止他们自己的权利被摧毁的时候，已经来临了。其他讲演者斥责为富豪及其走狗所押持的陪审团制度。其后，大会主席毛皮工会代表史特劳斯号召与会群众于三月七日（即继续“审讯”美共领袖的一天），在联邦法院的门前举行示威。大会并决议致函新泽西州州长德里斯戈尔，要求无条件释放因捏造的“杀人罪”而被判死刑的六个黑人。
