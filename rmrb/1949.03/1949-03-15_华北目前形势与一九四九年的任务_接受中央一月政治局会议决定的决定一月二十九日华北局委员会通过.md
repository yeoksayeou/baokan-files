　　The Current Situation in North China and the Tasks for 1949
    Decision of the North China Bureau Committee on Accepting the Decision of the Central Committee's January Political Bureau Meeting, Passed on January 29th
    A. The Situation
    The largest cities in North China, Beiping and Tianjin, have already been liberated. Now, only a few isolated points remain in the entire North China region, such as Taiyuan, Datong, Guisui, Baotou, Xinxiang, and Anyang, which will soon also be liberated. The great significance of the complete liberation of North China is that it makes North China a solid rear area for the national revolutionary war, and it makes it possible for North China to carry out planned, large-scale production and construction, thereby promoting China's gradual transformation from an agricultural country into an industrial country. However, the complete liberation of North China is not equivalent to the victory of the whole country. The Kuomintang reactionaries are playing peace conspiracies, attempting to gain a temporary respite in order to prepare their forces, make a comeback, and extinguish the revolutionary forces. Therefore, we must raise our vigilance and, under the correct leadership of Chairman Mao and the Central Committee, carry the revolution through to the end. It will still take some time to thoroughly, completely, and eliminate the Kuomintang bandit troops and liberate all of China. If the national land reform is implemented and the Kuomintang remnants are eliminated, it will take even more time. Therefore, we must continue to work hard to support the national war.
    The reasons for the complete liberation of all of North China are, first of all, the result of the hard struggle of the entire party and army in North China under the correct leadership of Chairman Mao and the Central Committee. Secondly, it is the result of the fundamentally correct line and policies implemented by the North China Party during the Anti-Japanese War and after the Japanese surrender. Furthermore, it is also the result of the constant annihilation of the enemy and assistance in the liberation of North China by the fraternal field armies of Northeast, East China, Central Plains, and Northwest.
    The North China Party has a long history of struggle, with more than one million party members. In recent years, especially since 1948, with the help of the Central Committee, most cadres have learned the specific policies and strategies in rural work, urban work, and military work; in correcting right and left deviations, they have straightened out their policy thinking, and there has been further assurance in the implementation of the Party's general line and general policy.
    B. Tasks
    (1) Continue to work hard to support the national liberation war, continue to export manpower, materials, and financial resources, and closely link the task of consolidating North China and building North China with the task of supporting the national liberation war and striving for the complete victory of the national revolution. Oppose harmful ideas such as closed-door construction, the concept of peace, departmentalism, and localism.
    (2) Launch a large-scale production movement, and earnestly ensure that production is increased by an inch on the existing basis, otherwise supporting the national war will become empty talk. The 1949 production plan formulated by the North China Bureau must be earnestly implemented. The formulation of production plans in various regions should meet the needs of the national revolutionary situation and revolutionary tasks. After the elimination of the feudal exploitation system in the old liberated areas, it does not mean that production and construction can proceed peacefully and there is no longer any class struggle. On the contrary, the Kuomintang will take covert and espionage struggles to attack us. Therefore, we must raise our vigilance. Because China's economy is very backward, in order to develop the New Democratic economy, it is necessary to resolutely implement the policy of protecting industry and commerce that the Central Committee has already established, in order to maximize the positive role of capitalism as much as possible. But on the other hand, we must not forget for a moment to fight against certain speculative and destructive aspects of private capitalism, so that it develops in a direction that is beneficial to the national economy and the people's livelihood. In order to develop the scattered, individual, small-producer economy in the direction of collectivization, cooperative movements (production, consumer, and credit cooperatives) should be carried out in a planned and focused manner according to needs and possibilities, and leading organs of cooperatives should be organized at the provincial, county, and district levels to make them the link between the state-owned economy and the leadership and transformation of peasants and small-scale production economies.
    (3) According to the instructions of the Central Committee, the focus of the Party's leadership should gradually shift from the countryside to the cities. In the future, urban work must be done well in order to turn around and lead the countryside forward again. Therefore, leading organs at all levels, especially the higher-level party committees and large-city party committees, must be familiar with the various policies related to urban work stipulated by the Central Committee, and do all kinds of work in the city well. First of all, we must do a good job of workers' work. Rely on the proletariat, unite with other working people, intellectuals, the middle bourgeoisie, and all democrats and democratic parties to fight against imperialism, the Kuomintang reactionaries, and bureaucratic capitalism in order to transform and build the city. Eliminate the toxins of inferiority, praising foreigners, and lack of self-confidence that imperialism has cultivated in China for a century. Adhere to the principles and spirit of the proletariat, and oppose accommodating ideas. Do a good job in financial and economic work, learn to manage factories and do business, and build a New Democratic economy frugally and diligently. Learn to fight against the special agents of imperialism and the Kuomintang reactionaries. Cities are more complex than the countryside, and we must study hard in order to do our work well.
    (4) According to the needs of the revolutionary situation and revolutionary tasks, develop national education, primary school education, secondary school education, specialized universities, and adult supplementary education in a planned and universal manner. Establish advanced and intermediate vocational schools. Establish normal schools to solve the difficulty of teachers. After entering large cities, continue to operate the original universities and middle schools as much and as completely as possible. Improve the ideological and political level of newspaper and news agency work. Carry out literary and artistic work, and continue to implement the direction of serving workers, peasants, and soldiers. Carry out mass health work, and establish a hospital in each county as needed and as possible.
    (5) According to the needs of the national revolutionary situation and revolutionary tasks, strengthen the work of cadre schools (China University, Military and Political University, Revolutionary University, Vocational Cadre School, etc.). After entering Beiping and Tianjin, boldly enroll students and prepare to receive 25,000 to 30,000 young intellectuals, give them short-term training, and then send them to various parts of the country. Strengthen the Marxist-Leninist education of cadres and party members in service. All cadres, especially those above the level of the prefectural committee, must conscientiously study the books and documents stipulated in the "Decision on the Education of Cadres in Service" of the North China Bureau. All organs should conscientiously organize and improve spare-time remedial schools to improve the culture of cadres. Various regions should continue to hold short-term training classes for district and village cadres and party members on the basis of existing experience to improve their class consciousness, cultural level, and ability to handle affairs. Ensure the timely conscription of the 17,000 cadres allocated by the Central Committee to go south, and give them the necessary ideological and policy training.
    (6) The old liberated areas will continue to end the land reform and party rectification work, but it must be carried out around the production movement. The newly recovered areas should carry out land reform according to needs and possibilities, but it must also be carried out around production. All work should strive to save the people's resources, in accordance with the seasons, and not violate agricultural time. After the autumn, convene people's congresses at the village, district, county, and provincial levels, and village, district, county, and provincial people's government committees. Continue to overcome the coercive commandism and bureaucratic style of cadres. Improve the Party Committee system, and convene the party's congresses and representative meetings at all levels in North China. Elect the party's leading organs at all levels in accordance with the principle of democratic centralism within the party.
    (7) Strengthen the Party's work among workers, youth, and women. Strengthen the work of trade unions, establish a unified North China Federation of Trade Unions, strengthen the political and cultural education of workers, appropriately promote workers' welfare, and give play to their enthusiasm and creativity in production. Establish a unified North China Youth League organization. The North China Student Federation should unite the middle school and university students in North China to carry out study and various beneficial social activities, and become a strong component of the All-China Student Federation. Strengthen the strength of women in production, strengthen the work of female workers, organize rural women to carry out production, and protect their due democratic rights.
    (8) The Party should continue to carry out the struggle against undisciplined anarchism. The tasks for 1949 are arduous, and we must continue to oppose undisciplined anarchism in order to ensure the smooth completion of the tasks. In the past six months, all regions have achieved results in this regard, but they are uneven. The Central Committee stipulates that by the end of March, army regimental committees and above, and local county committees and above, should issue resolutions on this matter. This must be completed on schedule, and the struggle against undisciplined anarchism must be implemented in all future work. Implement Chairman Mao's instructions: neither be arrogant nor rash, be cautious and humble, and seek truth from facts. Continue to maintain the tradition of hard struggle. The Party's tasks will be more arduous in the future, and we must study hard to build a good New Democratic country.

　　华北目前形势与一九四九年的任务
    接受中央一月政治局会议决定的决定一月二十九日华北局委员会通过
    甲、形势
    华北最大的城市北平天津已经获得解放，现在华北全境只剩下太原、大同、归绥、包头、新乡、安阳等少数白点，不久亦可获得解放。华北全境解放的伟大意义，是使华北可能成为全国革命战争的巩固后方，是使华北可能进行有计划的大规模的生产建设，从而可以推进中国逐步地变农业国为工业国。但华北完全解放，还不等于全国已经胜利。国民党反动派正在玩弄和平阴谋，企图取得暂时喘息的机会，以便准备力量，卷土重来，扑灭革命势力。因此，我们必须提高警惕性，在毛主席和中央正确领导下，把革命进行到底。彻底、全部、消灭国民党匪军，解放全中国，尚需一段时间。如果全国实行土地改革，消灭国民党残余势力，则须更多的时间。故必须继续努力，支援全国战争。
    全华北获得完全解放的原因，首先，是由于华北全党全军在毛主席、中央正确领导下，努力奋斗的结果。其次，是由于抗日战争期间和日本投降以后，华北党所实行的路线和政策是根本上正确的结果。复次，也是由于东北、华东、中原、西北各兄弟野战军，不断地消灭敌人，协助华北解放的结果。
    华北党有长期斗争历史，有一百万以上的党员，近数年来，特别是一九四八年以来，在中央帮助下，大多数干部学会了在农村工作中，城市工作中与军事工作中的各项具体政策与策略；在纠正右的和左的偏向中，端正了政策思想，对党的总路线总政策的贯彻执行有了进一步的保证。
    乙、任务
    （一）继续努力支援全国解放战争，继续输出人力、物力、财力，把巩固华北和建设华北的任务与支援全国解放战争，争取全国革命的彻底胜利，密切的联系起来，反对关门建设、太平观念、本位主义、地方主义等有害思想。
    （二）开展大生产运动，认真做到使生产在现有基础上提高一寸，否则支援全国战争，就会变成空谈。华北局所制订的一九四九年的生产计划必须认真执行。各地生产计划的制订，要适合全国革命形势和革命任务的需要。在老区消灭封建剥削制度以后，并不等于生产建设可以和平进行，已经没有阶级斗争了，相反地国民党将采取隐蔽的和特务的斗争方式向我进攻。因此，我们必须提高警惕性。由于中国经济十分落后，为了发展新民主主义经济，就必须坚决执行中央早已定下来的保护工商业政策，以便尽可能地发挥资本主义的积极性。但另一方面，一时一刻也不能忘记与私人资本主义中某些投机性和破坏性作斗争，使其向有益于国民生计的方向发展。为了使分散的个体的小生产者经济向集体化方向发展，应该有计划地，有重点地按照需要和可能开展合作社运动（生产的消费的信用的合作社），组织省、县、区的合作社领导机关，使之成为国营经济领导与改造农民及小生产经济的纽带。
    （三）根据中央指示，党的领导重心，应逐渐地由乡村转移到城市。今后，必须把城市工作做好，才能反转过来，再领导乡村前进。因此，各级领导机关，首先高级党委大城市党委必须熟习中央所规定的有关城市工作的各种政策，把城市中的各种工作做好，首先就要作好工人工作。依靠无产阶级，团结其他劳动人民，知识分子，中等资产阶级及一切民主人士、民主党派向帝国主义、国民党反动派、官僚资本主义作斗争，以改造和建设城市。扫除帝国主义一世纪以来侵略中国所养成的卑怯、讴歌洋人、没有自信心的毒素。坚持无产阶级的原则精神，反对迁就思想。做好财政经济工作，学会管理工厂和作生意，要克勤克俭建设新民主主义经济。学会跟帝国主义和国民党反动派特务分子做斗争。城市比乡村更为复杂，必须用心学习，才能把工作做好。
    （四）根据革命形势和革命任务的需要，有计划地、普遍地发展国民教育、小学教育、中学教育、专门大学、成人补习教育。创办高级的与中级的各项职业学校。创办师范学校，解决师资困难。进入大城市后，对原有的大中学校，尽可能地、全部地继续开办。提高报纸通讯社工作的思想政策水平。开展文学艺术工作，继续贯彻为工农兵服务的方向。开展群众卫生工作，按需要和可能，每县设立一个医院。
    （五）根据全国革命形势和革命任务的需要，加强干部学校（华大、军大、革大、职干等）的工作，进入平津后放手招生，准备接收二万五千至三万青年知识分子，加以短期训练后，输送到全国各地去。加强在职干部党员的马列主义教育。所有干部，首先是地委以上干部，必须认真学习华北局“关于在职干部教育的决定”中所规定的书籍文件。各机关应认真举办并改进业余补习学校，提高干部文化。各地应在已有经验的基础上，继续举办区村干部党员的短期训练班，提高其阶级觉悟、文化水平及办事能力。中央所分配南下的一万七千干部，保证及时征调，并给以必要的思想的和政策的训练。
    （六）老区继续结束土改与整党工作，但必须围绕生产运动去进行。新收复区应根据需要与可能进行土改，但亦必须围绕生产去进行。一切工作应力求节省民力，按照季节，不违农时。秋后普遍召开村、区、县、省各级人民代表会，村、区、县、省各级人民政府委员会。继续克服干部中强迫命令与官僚主义的作风。健全党委制，召开华北党的各级代表大会及代表会议。依党内民主集中原则，选举党的各级领导机关。
    （七）加强党在工人、青年及妇女中的工作。加强职工会工作，建立统一的华北总工会，加强对职工的政治、文化教育，适当推进工人福利事业，发挥他们在生产中的积极性与创造性。建立华北统一的青年团组织。华北学联，应团结全华北大中学生进行学习及各种有益的社会活动，并成为全国学联的有力的组成部分。加强妇女在生产中的力量，加强女工工作，组织农村妇女进行生产，并保障她们应有的民主权利。
    （八）党内应继续开展反对无纪律无政府状态的斗争。一九四九年任务繁重，必须继续反对无纪律无政府状态，才能保证任务的顺利完成。半年来，各地对此，都有成绩，但不平衡。中央规定军队团委以上，地方县委以上于三月底以前，故出关于此事的决议，必须按期完成，并将反对无纪律无政府状态的斗争贯彻到今后一切工作中去。实行毛主席的指示，不骄不躁，谨慎谦虚，实事求是。继续保持艰苦奋斗的传统。今后党的任务更繁重了，必须努力学习，把新民主主义国家建设好。
