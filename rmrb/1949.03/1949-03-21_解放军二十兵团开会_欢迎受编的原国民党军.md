PLA 20th Army Corps Holds Meeting to Welcome Former Kuomintang Troops Incorporated into its Ranks

[This newspaper's dispatch] On the afternoon of the 3rd of this month, at 3:00 PM, the PLA 20th Army Corps Headquarters Political Department held a meeting to welcome cadres at the regimental level and above from the Independent 25th Division (formerly the 22nd Division of the 16th Army of the Kuomintang Army), the Independent 55th Division (formerly the 56th Division of the 92nd Army of the Kuomintang Army), the Independent 53rd Division (formerly the 21st Division of the 92nd Army of the Kuomintang Army), and the artillery battalion, communications battalion, special service battalion, and reconnaissance battalion directly under the former 92nd Army, who have been incorporated into the People's Liberation Army. First, Director Li of the Army Corps Political Department delivered a welcoming speech, stating: Although today's meeting is simple in form, it is of great significance. The peaceful liberation of Beiping this time is mainly due to the strength of the people's forces, secondly, the unanimous desire for peace among the people of Beiping, and also the unwillingness of the more than 200,000 Kuomintang officers and soldiers defending the city to continue fighting. Director Li said: Today, everyone is incorporated into the People's Liberation Army, which is everyone's victory and glory. This is the victory of the Chinese people and the failure of the anti-people clique. Director Li encouraged everyone to transform themselves in the future, become cadres of the people, study hard, and make rapid progress in all aspects of ideology and work. Then, Commander Yang of the Army Corps spoke, introducing the style and system of the People's Liberation Army. Regarding the system, Commander Yang mainly introduced the political work system and political commissar system of the People's Liberation Army. He said: The political work of the People's Liberation Army mainly guarantees the unity of officers and soldiers, the unity of the army and the people, and the unity of friendly forces, consolidates and improves the combat effectiveness of the troops, and ensures the completion of combat missions. This is fundamentally different from the political training department of the Kuomintang; the political commissar is the representative of the Communist Party and the representative of the People's Government in the army, ensuring that the troops implement the Party's and the People's Government's various policies and ensure the completion of the Party's tasks. Regarding the issue of the style of the People's Liberation Army, Commander Yang said: The style of the People's Liberation Army is a heroic and tenacious combat style, a proactive and responsible work style, and a hard-working and simple lifestyle. This is the fine tradition of the Chinese People's Liberation Army. Then, the officers and soldiers of the incorporated troops spoke, unanimously expressing their acceptance of the direct command of Commander Yang and others, educating officers and soldiers, and embarking on the revolutionary path.

　　解放军二十兵团开会
    欢迎受编的原国民党军
    【本报讯】本月三日午后三时解放军廿兵团兵团司令部政治部召开欢迎编入人民解放军的独二十五师（原国民党军十六军二十二师），独五十五师（原国民党军九十二军五十六师），独五十三师（原国民党军九十二军二十一师），及原九十二军直属队炮兵营、通讯营、特务营、搜索营等团以上干部会议。首由兵团政治部李主任致欢迎词，略谓：今天会议形式虽简单，但意义重大，这次北平和平解放，主要由于人民力量强大，其次是北平人民一致渴望和平，还有守城二十多万国民党军官兵不愿继续作战之故。李主任说：今天大家编入人民解放军，这是大家的胜利和光荣。这是中国人民的胜利，是反人民集团的失败。李主任勉励大家今后改造自己，成为人民的干部，努力学习，在思想工作各方面来突飞猛进。继即由兵团杨司令员讲话，他介绍了解放军的作风和制度。关于制度，杨司令员主要介绍了解放军的政治工作制度和政治委员制度。他说：解放军的政治工作主要是保证官兵团结，军民团结和友军团结，巩固和提高部队战斗力，保证完成战斗任务的。这和国民党的政训处是根本不同的；政治委员是共产党的代表，又是人民政府在部队中的代表，是保证部队执行党的和人民政府的各种政策，保证完成党的任务的。关于解放军作风问题上，杨司令员说：解放军的作风是英勇顽强的战斗作风，积极负责的工作作风，艰苦朴素的生活作风，这是中国人民解放军的优良传统。接着受编部队官兵讲话，一致表示接受杨司令员等直接指挥，教育官兵，走上革命的道路。
