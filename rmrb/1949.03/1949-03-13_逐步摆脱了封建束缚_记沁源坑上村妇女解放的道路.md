　　Gradually Breaking Free from Feudal Shackles
　　——A Record of the Path to Women's Liberation in Kengshang Village, Qinyuan
　　The women of Kengshang Village, Qinyuan District 1, organized a women's rescue association under the leadership of female Party member Ma Guizhi starting in 1938. Simultaneously, Li Haixiang, Shi Yueyuan, Zheng Linxiang, and others were developed to join the Party. However, when they began their work, they encountered restrictions and obstructions from their families. For example, Ma Yufu was often beaten by her husband for attending meetings, and Li Haixiang's mother-in-law and husband wouldn't allow her to be trained in the district. When the women collectively returned after gathering firewood for the families of soldiers resisting Japan, they were not allowed to eat at home. But they were not discouraged. Guo Aiying was often abused by her mother-in-law, so the women's rescue association performed a tragic play called "Cruel Family," which caused her mother-in-law to change somewhat. In particular, their participation in various tasks and their achievements demonstrated the power of women, which gradually changed their social status. In the spring of 1945, during the famous struggle to encircle Qinyuan city against the Japanese invaders, women and men worked together to harvest and plant, actively engaging in production to solve family difficulties. Sometimes women were in more dangerous positions than men. For example, fearing that men would be captured and killed by the enemy, they secretly returned to cook, deliver food, and move belongings. Men dug kilns while women dug soil, men cut down corn stalks while women carried the ears down the mountain, and the weaker ones stood guard on the mountain top. They also participated in the explosion campaign, manufacturing detonators and stone mines, and competing with the men. During the second year of the siege of Qinyuan, life became even more difficult, so women spun yarn and wove cloth, resolving many family problems. During three years of fleeing from the enemy, Ma Yuying spun yarn to exchange for cloth and gathered mountain goods. In addition to supplementing the family expenses, she saved four shi of rice and bought three mu of river beach land. Liu Langying's husband was captured by the enemy, so she cultivated more than ten mu of land with her child to maintain their livelihood. In this way, men's attitudes towards women began to change, and women's own awareness also improved. After the enemy retreated, under the leadership of the Women's Federation, they actively launched a spinning and weaving campaign. The village developed from one spinning wheel to sixteen looms and fifty spinning wheels. All fifty-eight able-bodied women and eighteen semi-able-bodied women in the village, except for two elderly and weak and one disabled, learned to spin and weave. In the previous year alone, they spun 796 jin of yarn and wove 3,753 zhang and 2 chi of cloth, earning 115 shi and 7 dou of rice. Zheng Linxiang, a spinning and weaving hero, earned 11 shi and 8 dou of rice alone. This labor laid the economic foundation for women's independence. However, due to the deep-rooted feudal poison, some problems had not been completely resolved. In some families, women still had to obtain their husband's consent to sell an egg or ask their husband for money to buy some needlework. During this initial Party rectification and the beginning of the end of land reform, the leadership did not pay attention to mobilizing women's work. It was not until the later stages of the work that several women's meetings were held in a row. Comrade Cao Fangsuo, the district secretary, explained the principle of equality between men and women, various laws and decrees of the government guaranteeing women's rights, the achievements of women's work in recent years, and the suffering women were currently experiencing, further enlightening women's awareness. Women made serious criticisms of the branch and cadres for looking down on women and neglecting women's work. After the branch, Party members, and cadres earnestly reviewed their incorrect attitudes towards women's work, discussions were held in the winter school. Some men automatically reviewed their past mistakes of looking down on women and should not have beaten women, guaranteeing that they would implement family democracy in the future. Finally, everyone passed several conditions for guaranteeing women's democratic rights: (1) No one is allowed to beat women. (2) The family must be democratic, matters must be discussed, and women must be equal to men economically. (3) Land certificates must include a share of land for women. (4) Women must participate in the village people's representative conference and the government committee. (5) Freedom of marriage; no one can arrange it. After this period of work, the organization of the Women's Federation was expanded, and women's awareness was raised. In addition to more than forty young women members, there were also twenty-three elderly members. Everyone said, "These are truly good times; I never thought we would have such days." When Li Suo married off his daughter, he wanted to collect a bride price, but his daughter said, "You can't sell me. Even if I find a way later, I will take care of you more!" Li Suo didn't say anything more. The women seriously participated in the elections, electing four representatives to participate in the people's representative conference and the village government committee.

　　逐步摆脱了封建束缚
    ——记沁源坑上村妇女解放的道路
    沁源一区坑上村的妇女，从一九三八年起，就在女党员马桂枝的领导下组织了妇救会，同时又发展了李海香、史月元、郑林香等参加了党。但她们开始工作，就遇到家庭的限制和阻碍，如马玉符常因参加开会受男人打骂，李海香的婆婆和丈夫，不让她到区里受训。妇女们集体给抗属打柴回来，家中不让吃饭。可是她们并不灰心，郭爱英经常受婆婆虐待，妇救会就演了一幕“残忍家庭”的悲剧，她婆婆看了，就有点转变。特别是她们参加了各种工作，取得了成绩显示了妇女们的力量，才逐渐改变了她们的社会地位。一九四五年春，在有名的围困沁源城日寇的斗争中，妇女和男人一道抢收抢种，积极劳动生产，解决家庭困难。有时妇女处于比男人更危险的地位，如她们怕男人被敌人抓住杀害，就偷偷回去做饭、送饭，转移东西。男人打窑女人刨土，男人砍倒玉茭，女人搬下穗子背上山，身体较弱的在山头放哨。她们又在爆炸运动中制造爆发管、打石雷和男人们展开竞赛。围困沁源的第二年生活更困难了，妇女们就纺花织布，解决了家庭不少困难。马玉英在三年逃难中，纺花换布、打山货除添补家中花销外，还积存下四石米，买了三亩河滩地。刘郎英的男人被敌抓走，她和孩子耕种着十来亩地，维持生活。这样，开始转变了男人对妇女的态度，妇女们自己的觉悟也提高了。敌人退走后，在妇联会领导下，积极地展开纺织运动，该村从一架纺花车，发展到十六架织布机、五十辆纺花车，全村妇女五十八个全劳力，十八个半劳力，除两个老弱一个残废外，都学会了纺织。前年一年，她们纺了七百九十六斤花，织了三千七百五十三丈二尺布，赚了一百一十五石七斗米，纺织英雄郑林香一人就赚了十一石八斗米。这样劳动的结果，打下了妇女在经济上独立的基础。但是由于封建的恶毒太深了，仍有些问题没有完全解决，有些家庭里，妇女卖一个鸡蛋，也还要经过丈夫同意，买几件针线，也得向丈夫求钱。这次初步整党和结束土地改革的开始，领导上没有重视发动妇女的工作，直到工作的后一时期，才一连开了几次妇女会议，区分书记曹芳锁同志，给解释了男女平等的道理，政府保障妇女权利的各种法令，及几年来妇女工作的成绩，和现在妇女所受的痛苦等，进一步启发了妇女们的觉悟。妇女们对支部、对干部轻视妇女忽视妇女工作等，提出了严正的批评。支部、党员、干部，都认真检讨了对妇女工作的不正确态度后，又在冬学里进行了讨论。有些男人自动检讨过去轻视妇女不对，更不该打骂女人，保证以后要实行家庭民主。最后大家通过了保障妇女民主权利的几个条件：（一）不准打骂妇女。（二）家庭要民主，作事要商量，妇女经济上和男人平等。（三）发土地证有妇女一份土地。（四）妇女要参加村人民代表会、政府委员会。（五）婚姻自由，谁也不能包办。经过这段工作后，妇联会的组织扩大了，妇女们的觉悟提高了，除了四十多个青年妇女会员外，还有二十三个老年会员，大家都说：“现在真是好世道，想不到咱还能有这么两天。”李锁出嫁他闺女时，想要采礼，闺女说：“你不能卖我，哪怕我以后有了办法，多照顾你些哩！”李锁就没再开口。妇女们认真的参加了选举，选出四个代表参加了人代会和村政府委员会。
