Xinhua News Agency, Peiping, March 6th: The Peiping People's Daily has received a letter from Shen Xiaojiong and eight other former staff members of the puppet Executive Yuan's US Aid Utilization Committee's Peiping office. In this letter, they expose the US Economic Cooperation Administration's North China office's attempt to seize over 6,600 bags of flour that already belonged to China. The full text of the letter is as follows:

Editor:

We are a group of staff members who served at the Peiping office of the puppet Executive Yuan's US Aid Utilization Committee. The office is currently being taken over by comrades sent by the Military Control Commission, but a minor incident occurred during the takeover process. This incident hindered the smooth progress of the takeover and also tarnished our reputation, as we were suspected. Although this incident is in the past and the suspicion against us has been largely clarified as a misunderstanding, we feel compelled to narrate the facts so that people can recognize our position and understand whether "US Aid" is intended to assist the Chinese people or to aid the Kuomintang reactionary and traitorous government. The facts are as follows:

On February 10th, comrades from the Military Control Commission came to discuss taking over our office and discovered that 6,641 bags of "US Aid" flour remained in the office (at No. 42 Dongjiaominxiang). Since this batch of flour belonged to the puppet US Aid Utilization Committee, it should naturally be taken over by the Military Control Commission and become the property of the people. However, the US Economic Cooperation Administration's North China Representative Office (also at No. 42 Dongjiaominxiang) claimed that it was their property and refused to hand it over. Despite repeated negotiations by our office, no result was achieved. However, our office has detailed records of the origin and whereabouts of this batch of flour.

In the past, "US Aid" flour transported to Peiping had always been entrusted to the Tianjin Materials Storage and Transportation Office of the puppet Ministry of Communications for transportation and storage. From January 17th to 19th, the ECA moved 18,693 bags of flour stored in the open air in front of Nei Qipan Street and 12,796 bags of flour stored in the First Warehouse (Xiliuhuijing) (most of which had been distributed in batches earlier, leaving only 14 bags) to the courtyard at No. 42 Dongjiaominxiang. These two batches of flour, plus 300 bags previously stored by the ECA, totaled 31,789 bags. On January 22nd, at noon, Darley Clark, the director of the ECA, gave a "letter of authorization" to the person in charge of the Tianjin Materials Storage and Transportation Office of the puppet Ministry of Communications in Peiping, stating that from the 22nd onward, these 12,796 bags of flour (the portion stored in the First Warehouse) would be considered the "property" of the ECA. At the same time, our office was also notified, stating that this was in accordance with a telegram order and had been approved by the US Aid Utilization Committee in Shanghai. Due to postal difficulties, the ECA relayed this order. In this way, the ECA seized this batch of flour, and even without this procedure, they also seized the remaining portion of the flour. This batch of flour was intended for distribution to various public and educational institutions. From January 27th to February 5th, the ECA distributed flour to various public and educational institutions in batches, including those already distributed from the First Warehouse, totaling 18,979 bags. On February 2nd, a special allocation of 369 bags was made to the puppet Peiping Municipal Food Allocation Committee. From February 3rd to 8th, the ECA also privately allocated 5,770 bags to various charitable organizations and hospitals (most of these organizations and hospitals were run by foreigners and foreign churches), and another 30 bags were lost during transportation, totaling 25,248 bags. As mentioned above, there were originally 31,789 bags of flour. Subtracting this amount leaves 6,641 bags. This is the origin of the 6,641 bags of flour, which the ECA stubbornly claims is their property and refuses to hand over to the Chinese people. From February 10th to February 16th, comrades from the Military Control Commission negotiated with our office several times to take over this batch of flour, and our office also negotiated with the ECA repeatedly, but to no avail. It was not until the morning of the 17th that Director Li of our office negotiated forcefully with Darley Clark, demanding that he return this batch of flour to our office for transfer to the Military Control Commission. Knowing that he was in the wrong, Darley Clark agreed with Director Li to open the warehouse lock. On that same day and the next day, our office transferred this batch of flour to the Military Control Commission, with workers hired by our office moving the flour out of the warehouse and staff members assigned to check the quantities. The above is the actual situation of this incident.

Regarding this matter, the comrades sent by the Military Control Commission suspected: Why was the flour that originally belonged to the puppet US Aid Utilization Committee transferred to the ECA? Was it because they were unwilling to have the People's Liberation Army take it over? The fact is: it was not our office's initiative to hand over the flour to the ECA, but rather they seized it forcibly. At that time, the People's Liberation Army had not yet entered Peiping, and foreigners still wielded considerable power, so we could not argue with them reasonably.

This incident has taught us a lesson. We now deeply understand that "US Aid" is not intended to assist the Chinese people, but only to aid the Kuomintang reactionary and traitorous government. Otherwise, why would the ECA refuse to hand over the flour and insist on seizing it on January 22nd?

Regarding our own position, we also want to declare to the public that in the past, we served in this organization for the sake of our livelihoods, and we were by no means willingly working for the Kuomintang reactionary and traitorous government. Now that we are liberated, we realize that we should firmly stand on the side of the people and serve them. We are unwilling and will not allow anyone to discriminate against us, because we are all Chinese people with conscience!

Sincerely,

Shen Xiaojiong, Zhao Zhongmin, Duan Changtong, Wang Guangdi, Guo Shu, Pan [Name incomplete], Wang Wanzhen, Liu Jieren, Su Yizhi

　　美经合总署图强霸中国面粉
    伪美援运用委员会在平职员予以揭露
    【新华社北平六日电】北平人民日报收到伪行政院美援运用委员会前北平办事处职员沈孝炯等九人的信件，在这封信里他们揭露了美国经济合作总署华北区办公处企图霸占已属于中国的六千六百余袋面粉的经过。这封信全文如下：编辑先生：
    我们是在伪行政院美援运用委员会北平办事处服务的一群职员，本处现在正由军管会派来的同志办理接管，但在接管工作进行期间，发生了一件不大不小的波折。这波折使接管工作没能很顺利的进行，同时使我们全体同人沾上了污点，我们曾被怀疑。这件事虽然已成过去，并且我们之被怀疑已大致解释清楚，知道是一种误会；但我们不得不把事实经过叙述一下，使人们认清我们的立场；同时使人民知道：究竟“美援”是为了援助中国人民呢，还是为了援助国民党反动卖国政府？事实的经过是这样的：
    二月十日，军管会的同志来接洽接管本处，发现本处（在东交民巷四十二号）还存有“美援”面粉六千六百四十一袋。这批面粉既是属于伪美援运用委员会的，当然应该由军管会接管，变为人民的财产。但是美国经济合作总署华北区代表办公处（也在东交民巷四十二号）却说这是他们的产权，拒绝交出。几经本处向他们交涉，都没有结果。但本处对这批面粉的来龙去脉却有详细的记录。
    运到北平的“美援”面粉，过去一直是由本处委托伪交通部天津材料储运处代为运输储藏的。到一月十七日至十九日，经合署把在前内棋盘街露天存的面粉一万八千六百九十三袋和第一仓库（西柳会井）所存的面粉一万二千七百九十六袋（其中大部已先陆续配出，只余十四袋），搬运到东交民巷四十二号院的，以上两批面粉再加上经合署前存的三百袋，一共是三万一千七百八十九袋。一月二十二日中午经合署的主任达理祺给伪交通部天津材料储运处在北平的负责人一纸“委托书”，说从二十二日起这一万二千七百九十六袋面粉（第一仓库存的那部分）就算作经合署的“财产”了，同时，也通知了本处，说这是奉到电令，而且也得到上海美援运用委员会的同意，因为邮递困难，由经合署转达此项命令。就这样，经合署把这批面粉抓到手里，而其余部分的面粉甚至于连这个手续也没有，无形中也抓到手里。这批面粉是为了配售各公教单位的。从一月二十七日到二月五日，陆续又由经合署配售各公教单位，连以前在第一仓库已配出的，共配出一万八千九百七十九袋。二月二日特别配给伪北平市民食调配委员会三百六十九袋。二月三日至八日，经合署又私做人情拨给各慈善机关和医院五千七百七十袋（这些机关和医院大部分是外侨和外国教会所办的），另外搬运损耗三十袋，以上合计二万五千二百四十八袋。上面说原有面粉三万一千七百八十九袋，减去这个数目，还余六千六百四十一袋。这就是六千六百四十一袋面粉的来历，而经合署却硬说这是他们的财产，不准备交给中国人民。从二月十日至二月十六日，军管会的同志几次与本处交涉接管这批面粉，同时本处也屡次向经合署交涉，均无结果。一直拖到十七日上午，本处李主任向达理祺据理作强硬的交涉，要他把这批面粉还给本处，再移交给军管会。达自知理亏，才会同李主任把仓库的锁打开。就在当天和次日，本处把这批面粉移交给军管会，由本处雇工人从仓库中搬出面粉，并派员点交。——以上是这个波折的经过实际情形。
    对于这件事，军管会派来的同志曾怀疑：为什么原来是伪美援运用委员会的面粉，却转给经合署呢？是不是不愿意叫人民解放军接管呢？而事实是：并不是本处主动的要把面粉交给经合署，而是他们硬抓到手里。那时解放军还没有进北平，洋人还有余威，我们无法和他评理。
    这件事，给我们一个经验教训，我们现在深切知道：“美援”并不是为了援助中国人民，只是为了援助国民党反动卖国政府。要不然，经合署为什么拒绝把面粉交出来，同时偏偏在一月二十二日那天把面粉硬抓在手里呢？
    关于我们自己的立场，也要向社会人士表白一下，过去我们在这个机关服务，都是为了饭碗问题，决不是甘心情愿给国民党反动卖国政府做事。现在解放了，我们觉悟到应该坚决地站在人民的立场来服务，我们不甘心，更不许任何人对我们有所歧视。因为我们都是有良心的中国人呀！敬礼！
