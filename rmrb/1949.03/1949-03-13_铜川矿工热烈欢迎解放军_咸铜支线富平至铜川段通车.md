    Xiantong Branch Line, Fuping to Tongchuan Section, Opens to Traffic
    [Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 9th] The workers of Tongchuan Coal Mine warmly welcomed the People's Liberation Army. When the Northwest People's Liberation Army marched into the mining area early in the morning on February 20th, the streets were already plastered with slogans such as "Welcome the well-disciplined People's Liberation Army" and "Welcome the People's Liberation Army that does not violate the people's interests even by a hair." The workers first swarmed to the streets, surrounding the commanders and fighters of the People's Liberation Army, and said enthusiastically and excitedly: "We have been looking forward to you for so long, and you have finally arrived today!" As soon as the propagandists of the People's Liberation Army took out a roll of propaganda materials, they were immediately snatched up by the workers for distribution and posting. On the day the mining area was declared liberated, production continued as usual. Several workers even voluntarily led the People's Liberation Army search troops and found two enemy plainclothes detectives in hiding. General Zhao Shoushan, Deputy Commander of the Northwest People's Liberation Army, visited the mining area, inquired about the workers' living conditions, and solicited the workers' opinions on the Communist Party and the People's Government's policies on industry and commerce and labor policies. At the workers' enthusiastic request, Deputy Commander Zhao gave a cordial speech to the workers that afternoon. After congratulating the workers on their liberation and praising their actions in protecting the factory, he said: Tongchuan Coal Mine is one of the important economic lifelines of our Shaanxi. From now on, it belongs to our people, and you have become the true masters. I hope that under the leadership of the People's Government, you will work hard to increase production and meet the needs of the people and the new socialist industry. After hearing Deputy Commander Zhao's words, the workers said: "We must work hard from now on!"
    [Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 10th] The section of the Longhai Railway's Xian (yang) - Tong (chuan) branch line from Fuping to Tongchuan began operating on the fifth day after the liberation of Fuping, i.e., on the 3rd of this month. The first train departed from Tongchuan Coal Mine to Fuping, carrying 205 tons of coal. This section of the railway is 140 li long.

    咸铜支线富平至铜川段通车
    【新华社延安九日电】铜川煤矿工人热烈欢迎解放军。当西北人民解放军在二月二十号清早开进矿区的时候，街道上已经贴满了“欢迎纪律严明的解放军”、“欢迎秋毫无犯的解放军”等标语。工人们首先涌到街上来，把解放军指战员包围起来，热情而兴奋地说：“我们眼都望穿了，你们今天可来啦！”解放军的宣传员才拿出来一卷宣传品，马上便被工人们抢过去散发和张贴起来。矿区宣告解放的当天，生产照常进行。有几个工人还自动引着解放军搜索部队搜出了二个暗藏的敌军便衣侦探。西北人民解放军副司令员赵寿山将军曾往矿区视察，探问工人们的生活情形，并征求工人们对共产党和人民政府工商业政策和劳动政策的意见。在矿工们热烈的要求下，赵副司令员在当天下午和工人们作了一次亲切的讲话，他在庆贺工人们的解放和赞扬工人们保护工厂的行动以后说：铜川煤矿是我们陕西的重要经济命脉之一，今后它就属于我们人民所有了，你们已经成了真正的主人了。希望大家在人民政府领导下，努力提高产量，满足人民和新社会工业的需要。听了赵副司令员的话后，工人们说：“我们今后一定要好好地工作！”
