　　Our Trade Union
　　　　Clerk of Yangquan Sanhe Factory, Gu Chixin
　　Our trade union office is located in the courtyard of the workers' children's school. Its entrance faces the main road, and workers pass by here every day on their way to and from work. When they are early for work or after getting off work, they take a moment to stop by and take a look. A large blackboard hangs at the entrance, and it regularly displays news that we want to see. Entering the courtyard, you can see many children of our workers playing on slides, seesaws, and swings. These workers' children had never enjoyed this happiness before the Communist Party liberated Yangquan. When someone asks a student, "What does your father do?" The child being asked will quickly answer, "Works in the factory!" Then many children will say, "My dad works too!" These children also know the greatness of working! Inside the trade union office, maps and various mathematical proportion charts are hung all over. Most meaningful are the comic strips about labor discipline, from going to work in the morning to getting off work in the evening, cherishing tools, saving raw materials, and respecting teachers and loving apprentices. The workers said after seeing them: "This is about our own affairs! They have drawn us in!" Various books and newspapers attract many workers, who are sure to take a look every day after work. Older workers come to the trade union to play chess and read newspapers, while young workers like to play the erhu and sing songs. Especially in the afternoon, when you pass by from the street, you can hear the singing and laughter from inside. The trade union director, Lü Xingmei, is busy all day long. This worker goes to collect coal tickets, and that worker goes to report. Workers go to him for anything, which further increases the lively and tense atmosphere in the trade union office. The workers' spare-time school organized by the trade union starts classes on time. The workers say: "My son goes to the workers' children's school, and I go to the spare-time school. This breaks the old rule that workers can't study!"

　　我们的职工会
    阳泉三合工厂文书  股赤心
    我们职工会的办公室设在职工子弟学校的院子里，它的门口正冲着大路，每天工人们上下班都由这里过，上班早了或下班以后，抽个空闲时间都顺去看一看，它的门口挂着一块很大的黑板，这块黑板上经常登出我们愿意看的消息，走进院子，就看到好多我们职工自己的子弟，在那里玩滑梯、跳板、打秋千，这些职工子弟，在共产党没解放阳泉以前，是没享过这个幸福的。当有人问那个学生：“你爸爸干什么？”被问的孩子会很快答：“在厂子上工！”接着就有许多孩子说：“我爸也上工！”这些孩子，也知道了上工的伟大！在职工会的办公室里，满挂着地图和各种数学的比例表，最有意义的是劳动纪律连环画，由早晨上工晚间下工，爱护工具，节省原料一直做到尊师爱徒，工人们看了说：“这是自己的事！给咱们画上了！”各种书籍、报纸吸引着许多工人，每天下工一定去看。老年工人到工会来，愿意下棋、看报，青年工人愿意拉胡琴，唱歌子，特别是下午，从大街上一过，就听见里边的歌声和笑声。职工会主任吕兴梅，一天忙个不可开交，这个工人去领炭票，好个工人去汇报，工人有什么事，也去找他，就更增加了职工会办公室里的热闹和紧张的空气。职工会组织的工人业余学校，按时上课，工人们说：“儿子上了职工子弟学校，我上了业余学校，这可打破了工人没法念书的老规矩！”
