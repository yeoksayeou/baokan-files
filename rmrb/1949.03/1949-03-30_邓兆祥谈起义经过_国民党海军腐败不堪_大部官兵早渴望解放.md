Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, March 27th: After the uprising cruiser Chongqing arrived in Huludao, reporters visited the officers and men of the ship and Captain Deng Zhaoxiang.

Deng is from Gaoyao, Guangdong, and is 47 years old. He began studying the navy at the age of twelve. When asked about the Chongqing's uprising, Captain Deng said excitedly: This uprising was by no means accidental, but the result of the Kuomintang's corrupt rule, and also the realization of the wishes of most naval cadets for many years.

Captain Deng denounced the corruption of the Kuomintang-ruled navy. He said that the so-called Commander-in-Chief of the Navy and top war criminal Gui Yongqing did not understand the navy at all. His administration changed policies frequently, without distinguishing right from wrong, and relied only on personal likes and dislikes. Truly talented naval cadres were suppressed, while a group of corrupt elements who were good at boasting and flattering, regardless of whether they understood the navy or not, could wear the uniforms of naval generals. Under his rule, the navy was full of smuggling and corruption, plundering and slaughtering the people, while being servile to the US imperialist fleet. Because he did not understand the navy, there was of course no policy or construction to speak of. If there was, it was to use the navy as a tool to oppress the people and faithfully serve US imperialism and the Four Big Families.

　　　　The Kuomintang Navy is Actively Preparing for War

Speaking of the Kuomintang's "peace" conspiracy, Captain Deng revealed that the Kuomintang Navy had never stopped carrying out and preparing for war. War criminal Gui Yongqing had said more than once: "The army will not fight, the navy will fight." In fact, even when the Kuomintang was shouting "peace", most of its warships and gunboats were fully armed and berthed in various ports along the Yangtze River. The materials and equipment of the Jiangnan Shipyard in Shanghai were moved to Taiwan, preparing to resist stubbornly. Recently, the Kuomintang ordered a large number of ship repairs and amphibious tanks, preparing to supply Chiang Wei-kuo's armored corps. At the same time, it ordered the Jiangnan Shipyard to rush to build fifty gunboats before May of this year to continue the war. All of this fully demonstrates that the "peace" clamored by the Kuomintang reactionaries is actually just a deceptive trick.

　　　　Bombing of the Chongqing Exposes False Peace

Captain Deng indignantly denounced the Kuomintang Air Force's crime of continuously bombing the Chongqing, saying: "This further exposed that the Kuomintang had no sincerity for peace at all. This shameless act of the enemy can destroy our ships, but it cannot eliminate the revolutionary will of all our officers and men, nor can it eliminate the influence and role generated by the uprising of the Chongqing. In the future, under the leadership of Chairman Mao, Commander-in-Chief Zhu, and leaders at all levels, we must continue to fight for the construction of a new people's navy and the great revolutionary cause of liberating all of China."

　　　　The Kuomintang Navy Will Follow One After Another

In his speech, Captain Deng warmly hoped that all righteous people in the Kuomintang Navy could follow the path taken by the Chongqing and come to the Liberated Areas to participate in the construction of the new Chinese People's Navy. He said: "Due to the great victory of the People's Liberation Army, some naval bases, ports, docks, ships and all naval equipment that are temporarily controlled by US imperialism and the Kuomintang will soon be completely owned by the people. In order to defend world peace, for the sake of China's coastal defense, and to prevent China from being invaded by foreign imperialism, the Chinese people must build a strong navy, which requires many naval talents. Now, most of the naval officers under the rule of the Kuomintang, except for a very few bad elements, are ambitious young people. I believe they will come to join the People's Liberation Army one after another. All ports in the Liberated Areas are freely open to them. As long as they have no hostile actions, they will be able to dock safely. The soldiers and civilians of the Liberated Areas will warmly welcome their righteous actions with the same enthusiasm as they welcomed the Chongqing comrades."

　　邓兆祥谈起义经过
    国民党海军腐败不堪
    大部官兵早渴望解放
    【新华社沈阳二十七日电】在起义的重庆号巡洋舰到达葫芦岛后，记者曾往访该舰官兵及邓兆祥舰长。
    邓氏广东高要人，现年四十七岁，十二岁即学习海军。当记者询及重庆号举义经过时，邓舰长兴奋地说：这次起义绝非偶然，乃是国民党腐败统治的结果，也是大部分海军学员多少年来愿望的实现。
    邓舰长痛斥了国民党统治的海军的腐败。他说所谓海军总司令头等战犯桂永清根本就不懂海军，用的行政朝令夕改，不辨是非，只凭个人好恶，真正有才能的海军干部受到压抑，而一群善于吹牛拍马的腐化分子，不管懂不懂海军，都可以穿上海军将领的制服。在他的统治下，海军中充满了走私、贪污的事情，对人民抢掠屠杀，而对美帝国主义的舰队却奴颜婢膝。由于不懂得海军，当然也说不上什么政策和建设。如有的话，那就是以海军为工具来压迫人民，忠实的为美帝国主义及四大家族服务。
    　　　　国民党海军正积极备战
    谈及国民党的“和平”阴谋时，邓舰长揭露说：国民党的海军从没有一天不在进行和准备着战争，战犯桂永清更曾不止一次的说：“陆军不打，海军打”。事实上就在国民党高叫“和平”的时候，其大部战舰和炮艇，均武装整齐地停泊于长江各个港口，上海江南造船厂的物资设备，都迁往台湾，准备负隅顽抗。最近国民党更下令大批补修船只及水陆两用之坦克车，准备供给蒋纬国的装甲兵团使用。同时又限令江南造船厂于今年五月以前，赶造五十艘炮艇，继续进行战争。所有这些，都充分说明国民党反动派所叫嚣的“和平”，实际上不过是一个骗人的诡计而已。
    　　　　炸毁重庆号暴露假和平
    邓舰长愤慨地控诉国民党空军连续轰炸重庆号的罪行，他说：“这更暴露了国民党没有一点和平诚意。敌人这种无耻的行为可以摧毁我们的舰船，但却不能消灭我们全体官兵革命的意志，更不能消灭由于重庆号的起义所产生的影响和作用。今后我们在毛主席、朱总司令和各级首长领导下，一定继续为建设新的人民海军，和解放全中国的伟大革命事业而奋斗。”
    　　　　国民党海军必接踵而来
    邓舰长在说话中热烈的希望国民党海军中的一切正义之士，能够跟随重庆号所走过的道路，到解放区来参加新中国人民海军的建设工作。他说：“由于人民解放军的伟大胜利，现在暂时还被美帝国主义和国民党控制的一些海军基地、港口、船坞、舰只及一切海军设备，不久的将来一定会完全为人民所有。为着保卫世界和平，为着新中国的海防，使中国免遭外国帝国主义的侵略，中国人民必须建成一支强大的海军，这需要很多的海军人才。现在国民党统治下的海军官员除去极少数坏分子外，大部分都是有志气的青年，相信他们必会陆续来参加人民解放军。所有解放区的港口都为他们自由地开放着，只要他们没有敌对的行动，一定能够安全停泊，解放区军民必将向欢迎重庆号同仁一样地满腔热忱来欢迎他们的正义行动。”
