Comrade Dong Biwu's Speech

　　Comrade Dong Biwu, on behalf of the CPC Central Committee, extended warm greetings to the National Women's Congress and congratulated the congress on its successful conclusion. Comrade Biwu, with various specific figures, explained the great victories of the People's Liberation War over the past two years, pointing out that the liberated areas have eliminated feudalism, abolished the privileges of imperialism, and confiscated bureaucratic capital, and the people have established a free and democratic life. The Kuomintang reactionary government is about to collapse completely. The reactionary group headed by Chiang Kai-shek, starting in January of this year, has been playing with the conspiracy of peace, attempting to gain a respite, reorganize its forces, and stage a comeback. Chairman Mao Zedong promptly issued a statement on the current situation, putting forward eight peace conditions, giving a fatal blow to the Kuomintang's false peace conspiracy. Comrade Biwu analyzed the situation of Li Zongren's empty talk of peace, Chiang Kai-shek's arrangement for war, Sun Ke's getting the boot, and He Yingqin's appointment as the President of the Executive Yuan, saying: The Kuomintang reactionary government has been fragmented, and it is difficult to see who is the representative of the Kuomintang reactionary government. Now He Yingqin, with Chiang Kai-shek's approval, has taken office as the puppet President of the Executive Yuan, saying that his "cabinet formation" this time is a "peace cabinet formation." Who knows whether the peace he talks about is real or false? It depends on whether he accepts Chairman Mao's eight conditions in the upcoming peace negotiations. That is the best touchstone, and the people's eyes are discerning.

　　Comrade Biwu pointed out: Now the people have ruled half of China, and our primary task today is to carry the revolution through to the end. There are two methods: one is the Tianjin style, using force to take it down; the other is the Peiping style, resolving it through peaceful negotiations. The American imperialists have always been anti-Soviet and anti-communist, and their destruction of the Chinese revolution is inevitable. However, we Chinese people defeated Japan and will thoroughly defeat Chiang Kai-shek. We also have sufficient strength to defeat the American imperialists.

　　Comrade Biwu praised the great victory of the People's Liberation War and praised the great contributions of Chinese women, especially women in the liberated areas, to the Liberation War. He said: To carry the revolution through to the end, we must carry out construction in all aspects, especially developing production. Our broad masses of women should unite with workers, peasants, intellectuals, young students... throughout the country to strive for the liberation of all China and work hard to build a democratic and free life in politics, economy, and culture. Let us join hands with the international democratic women, participate in the world peace movement, combat the conspiracies of international and domestic reactionaries and all kinds of war provocateurs, and defend world peace.

　　董必武同志致词
    董必武同志代表中共中央，向全国妇代大会致热烈的敬礼，祝贺大会胜利成功。必武同志以各种其具体数字，说明人民解放战争两年多来的伟大胜利，指出：解放区消灭了封建，取消了帝国主义的特权，没收了官僚资本，人民已经建立了自由民主的生活。国民党反动政府就要全部垮台了，以蒋介石为首的反动集团，从今年一月开始，玩弄起和平的阴谋，企图获得喘息的时间，重整旗鼓，卷土重来。毛泽东主席及时发表了时局声明，提出八项和平条件，给予国民党的假和平阴谋以致命的打击。必武同志分析了李宗仁空言和平，蒋介石布置战争，孙科滚蛋，何应钦出任为行政院长的情况后，说：国民党反动政府已经四分五裂，人们已很难看出谁是国民党反动政府的代表。现在何应钦在蒋介石批准后，出任伪行政院长，说他这次“组阁”是“和平组阁”，谁知道他所谈的和平是真是假？那就看他在将要到来的和平谈判中，是否接受毛主席的八项条件，那是最好的试金石，人民的眼睛是雪亮的。
    必武同志指出：现在人民已经统治了半个中国，我们今天的首要任务是把革命进行到底。方法有两个：一是天津式的，用武力打下来；一是北平式的，用和平谈判的方式解决。美帝国主义者一贯反苏反共，对中国革命的破坏是必然的。但是，我们中国人民打败了日本，也将要彻底打败蒋介石，我们也有充足的力量，打败美帝国主义者。
    必武同志赞扬人民解放战争的伟大胜利，赞扬中国妇女，特别是解放区妇女对于解放战争的伟大贡献。他说：要把革命进行到底，必须进行各方面的建设，特别是发展生产。我们广大妇女，应该和全国工人、农民、知识分子、青年学生……在一起，争取全中国解放，努力建设政治经济文化的民主自由生活。和国际民主妇女携起手来，参加世界拥护和平运动，打击国际和国内的反动派各种各样战争挑拨者的阴谋，保卫世界和平。
