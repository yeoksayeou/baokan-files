【Shijiazhuang News】The first congress of the Shijiazhuang New Democratic Youth League solemnly opened on the 3rd of this month in the auditorium of the Municipal People's Congress. One hundred and twenty delegates attended the congress, representing thirty-three units and more than one thousand two hundred and fifty Youth League members in the city.

The congress lasted for five days. It adopted the draft of the Youth League Constitution promulgated by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China on January 1 of this year as the city's Youth League Constitution. It also discussed and adopted the "Work Summary Report on the City's Construction in the Past Eight Months," the "Work Tasks for 1949," and thirty-eight proposals related to learning, life, and other matters. At the end of the congress, through enthusiastic election, Wu Liren, Zhou Xiaoying, Wu Guirong, Li Shuyan, Duan Shengqin and other twenty-nine people were elected by secret ballot as the highest leading body of the city's Youth League – the Municipal Youth League Committee. Zhou Xiaoying was elected as a delegate to the National and North China New Democratic Youth League Congress, and the congress successfully closed on the evening of the 7th.

The delegates included representatives from public enterprises such as the Railway Bureau, Da Xing Cotton Mill, and Coking Plant, four middle schools including the Municipal Normal School, various government agencies, shops, security teams, urban districts, and suburban districts. Among them were female textile worker Li Shuyan and Fei Yuemei from the cotton mill, who won the red flag three times in the production competition, model workers Wu Guirong and Li Shijie, and model students He Xiaguang and Luo Huarui.

The venue was full of congratulatory banners and flags presented by various units, as well as wall newspapers and large-scale paintings, all colorful and dazzling. At the opening ceremony, Liu Xiufeng, Secretary of the Municipal Party Committee, and Mayor Ke Qingshi personally attended the congress and delivered speeches.

The congress was filled with a lively and joyful atmosphere throughout. It made appropriate evaluations and summaries of the Youth League's work in the past. During the few minutes of each recess, the venue resounded with loud songs and joyful laughter. Each important resolution passed by the congress was first fully discussed by the ten groups into which the delegates were divided, and then discussed and voted on by the congress before being finally adopted. The presidium and secretariat elected by the congress, as well as all the working comrades, worked tirelessly throughout the night. The delegates tirelessly exchanged reasons for their proposals. Among the thirty-eight proposals passed, there were suggestions to the municipal government to enrich the library's youth reading materials and establish vocational schools or add a middle school. It also suggested to the upcoming city-wide workers' congress to launch a production competition to welcome May Day. In addition, the congress discussed and approved proposals one by one, and handed them over to the Municipal Youth League Committee elected by the congress for implementation, including guaranteeing the democratic rights of young workers and shop assistants, and running evening supplementary schools.

The delegates affirmed that the "eight months of Youth League construction work" had achieved results, but criticized the previous leading body - the Shijiazhuang New Democratic Youth League Preparatory Committee, believing that its specific leadership was insufficient, and that it failed to solve the difficulties in the establishment and development of some units in a timely manner. At the same time, it failed to summarize and promote experience in a timely manner, and did not pay enough attention to the vital interests of young people, such as marriage, employment, schooling, and family problems. The congress included these opinions in the work summary.

The congress successfully completed its tasks in a tense and pleasant atmosphere for five days. Comrade Zhou Xiaoying said at the closing ceremony: "I hope that the delegates will bring back the spirit of the congress." He predicted that a completely new look would appear in the city's Youth League.

　　石市举行首届团代大会
  　市团领导机关成立
    【石家庄讯】石市新民主主义青年团首届代表大会于本月三日在市参议会大礼堂隆重揭幕。出席大会代表一百二十名，代表全市三十三个单位，一千二百五十多名团员。
    大会历时五日，先后通过接受中共中央本年度一月一日颁布的团章草案为本市团章，并讨论通过“本市建国八个月来的工作总结报告”，“一九四九年的工作任务”和有关学习、生活等提案三十八件。大会最后经热烈竞选，以无记名投票方式选出吴立人、周小英、吴桂荣、李淑燕、段生勤等二十九人为本市团的最高领导机构——市团委会，并选出周小英同志为出席全国及华北新民主主义青年团代表大会代表后，于七日晚胜利闭幕。
    到会代表中，包括铁路局、大兴纱厂、炼焦厂等公营企业、市立师范等四个中学、各机关、商店及保安队、市内区市郊区等。其中有在生产竞赛连得三次红旗的纱厂女工李淑燕、费月梅、模范工人吴桂荣、李世杰、模范学生何霞光、罗华瑞等。
    大会会场满布各单位赠送的贺旗贺幛，各单位的壁报、大布画，五彩缤纷，琳琅满目。揭幕会上，市委书记刘秀峰及柯庆施市长均亲莅大会致词。
    大会始终充满了活泼、欢愉的气氛，对过去团的工作，作出了适当的估价和总结，每当大会休息的几分钟内，会场便响起了嘹亮的歌声和愉快的欢笑；为大会通过的每一重要决议，均先经由代表分编成的十个小组进行充分讨论，然后再经大会讨论表决，最后通过。由大会选出的主席团和秘书处以及全体工作同志们，彻夜紧张的工作。代表们对于提案的研讨，不厌烦地互相倾诉理由。在三十八条通过的提案中，有建议市政府充实图书馆青年读物，增设职业学校或增加一所中学等，并对即将召开的全市职工代表大会建议：为迎接五月节展开生产竞赛。此外，对保障青年工人、店员的民主权利，举办业余补习学校等，均经大会逐一讨论通过并交由大会选举产生的团市委会执行。
    代表们对“八个月来的建团工作”肯定是有成绩的，但对过去领导机关——石家庄市新民主主义青年团筹委会提出了批评，认为过去具体领导不够，对某些单位的建团和发展中的困难未能及时解决；同时又未及时总结经验加以推广，尤其对青年的切身问题，如婚姻、职业、升学及家庭问题等关切不够。大会把这些意见归纳入工作总结内。
    大会在五天紧张愉快的空气中，胜利地完成任务。周小英同志在闭幕会上说：“希望各代表把大会的精神带回去。”他预期大会在全市的团将出现一个全新的面貌。
