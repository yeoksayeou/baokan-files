The women of the Daqinghe River area, who had suffered long under the ravages of the Chiang Kai-shek bandits, threw themselves into this large-scale support-the-front movement with unprecedented joy during the liberation of the Tianjin and Peking campaigns. Under the leadership of women's federations at all levels, they were dispersed to the front and rear field hospitals to care for the wounded; the women in the villages milled rice, ground flour, made shoes, and sewed clothes day and night; some organized self-defense forces to stand guard and watch out for fleeing enemies.

The women of Feng Village in Ba County, upon hearing about the attack on Tianjin, immediately organized a flour-milling team. Those without livestock took turns pushing the millstone in groups, working through the night. As they sweated profusely, they remembered the suffering of being driven to the low-lying areas by the enemy during the heavy snow last year, afraid to go home to sleep, and they pushed even harder. They sang, "Mill the rice and flour well, don't let the enemy run away. When Tianjin is captured this year, the soldiers at the front will come to eat sticky rice cakes." According to statistics from six districts in Ba County alone, they milled 340,400 catties of rice and 440,000 catties of cornmeal in eight days and eight nights.

The women of Lancheng Village in Jinwu County (newly established county) washed bloodstained clothes for the wounded all night, made 400 straw mattresses, and sewed 300 new pillows. When the Northeast People's Liberation Army passed by, they organized a 100-plus-member comfort team, hung red lanterns on the streets, and placed cigarettes and boiled water on the tables, warmly receiving their own soldiers. Dai Yuzhen, a poor peasant representative from Yu Village, used the four carts of firewood she had gathered in the autumn to heat the beds and boil water for the soldiers. She said at a mass meeting, "Our Northeast Army has come to liberate us. Let's use some firewood to heat the beds and show our enthusiasm." The women of Halaha Port, upon hearing that the Northeast People's Liberation Army was arriving soon, heated the beds in every home, and each family made a pair of large shoes, ready to offer as comfort. Each family sprouted ten catties of mung bean sprouts to ensure the supply of vegetables for the troops. When the troops arrived, they welcomed them from afar, looked at their shadows in the distance, ran home, and enthusiastically shouted in the streets, "The People's Liberation Army is here!" "Saviors are here!" "This year we'll have a peaceful year!" In Jinwu's Jiujiapu, led by Liu Damao, the director of the women's association, they organized two stretchers. She challenged the men, "If you don't have enough people, we'll fill in." In Feng Village, Sun Tuo, and a dozen other villages, the men went to the front lines, and the women organized self-defense teams, taking turns standing guard and checking pedestrians.

The women of Dongbaichun Village in Daxing County actively milled flour to pay public grain, and the female deputy village chief personally followed the carts to complete the grain transportation task. The women of the four villages of Old Sixth and Later Fifth in Anci County held a meeting and launched a "Make a Pair of Shoes" campaign. At that time, it was a cloudy day, and they were so anxious that they baked the paper stuffing dry in pots and made them immediately. In five days, they made 1,272 pairs of new shoes. The women of Xinzhen City completed the task of making 5,000 rice sacks in three days.

Tianjin and Peking have been liberated, and the women of the Daqinghe River area will no longer be trampled and ravaged by the Chiang Kai-shek bandits. They are celebrating this unprecedentedly great day with unrestrained excitement and joy. (Jizhong Branch)

　　大清河北妇女英勇参战记
    在蒋匪长期蹂躏下的大清河北广大妇女，在解放平津战役中，以空前愉快的心情投入了这一大规模的支前运动。在各级妇联会的带领下，她们分散到前、后方的各个兵站上照顾伤员；村里的妇女则不分昼夜地碾米、磨面、做鞋、缝衣；有的组织自卫队站岗放哨，警戒逃跑的敌人。
    霸县冯村的妇女，一听说打天津，马上组织了磨面组，没有牲口的，以小组为单位连夜替换推磨，当她们累得满头大汗的时候，想起去年下了大雪，被敌人赶到洼里不敢回家睡觉的苦难，就越推越带劲。嘴里唱着：“米面推的好，不叫敌人跑，头年打下天津卫，前方战士们来了吃粘糕。”仅霸县六个区的统计，八天八夜就碾了三十四万零四千斤米，磨了四十四万斤玉米面。
    津武县（新设县）澜城村妇女连夜给伤员洗血衣，做了四百条草褥子，缝了三百个新枕头。东北解放军路过时，她们组织了一百多人的慰问队，街上挂红灯，桌上摆着纸烟和开水，亲亲热热地招待自己的战士。于村贫农代表戴玉珍，把秋天拾来的四车柴火，给战士们烧炕，烧水。她在群众大会上说：“咱们东北军解放咱们来了，拿些柴火烧热炕，表表咱们的热心。”哈喇港妇女们，听说东北解放军快到，家家腾热炕，烧热炕，每家做一双大鞋，准备慰劳。每家生十斤绿豆芽，保证供给部队菜吃。部队来了，她们迎出很远，看着前面的影儿，跑回家去，在街里热情地乱嚷：“解放军来了！”“救命的来了！”“今年该过安生年了！”津武九家堡以妇会主任刘大娘为首，组织了两付担架，她对男同志们挑战说：“你们去的人要不够了，我们补。”冯村、孙坨一带十几个村子，男的到了前线，妇女们组织了自卫队，轮流站岗放哨，检查行人。
    大兴县东白町村的妇女们积极磨面交纳公粮，女村副亲自跟着大车完成了运粮任务。安次老第六、后第五等四个村的妇女开了会，发起做一双鞋运动，当时正遇上阴天，急得她们用锅烤干了夹纸，马上就做，五天就做成了一千二百七十二双新鞋。新镇市的妇女，三天完成了五千条米袋的任务。
    天津、北平解放了，大清河北的广大妇女再不会受蒋匪的践踏蹂躏。她们正以不可抑制的兴奋和愉快的心情，在庆祝这一空前伟大的日子。（冀中分社）
