Zhangjiakou Telegram: The Laishui County Production Promotion Cooperative reviewed its work last year and formulated its production plan for this year. The county has many mountains and little land. Ordinary farmers cannot maintain their livelihoods solely by relying on the land and must supplement their income through engaging in sideline occupations and selling firewood. In response to this situation, the Promotion Cooperative called on the masses last spring to "rely on the mountains for a living," organizing sideline production such as cutting timber, digging medicinal herbs, picking camellia, harvesting ramie bark, and gathering ramie leaves (for dye), and eliminating harmful animals. The cooperative's supply and marketing department sold mountain products and bought back native cloth, sea salt, pots, farm tools, and cotton, which were sold to farmers at prices lower than the market. This not only solved many difficulties for the masses but also yielded a net profit of 51,384,940 Jiao. During the spring grain shortage last year, the credit department lent out 248,434 jin of grain throughout the county, distributing it to 163 villages, benefiting 4,600 households and 21,300 people, which roughly solved the problem of food for spring planting and summer hoeing. Throughout the year, loans were used to buy 240 cattle and donkeys. In the autumn and winter seasons, 44 small handicraft and small producers were supported. In the winter, loans totaling 35,450,000 Jiao were issued, benefiting 160 households. The cooperative, accepting last year's experiences and lessons, has formulated this year's plan based on this year's major production tasks: 1. In order to ensure the completion of the task of planting 7,000 mu of peanuts and 5,000 mu of cotton, it plans to send special personnel to purchase 10,000 jin of peanut seeds and 5,000 jin of cotton seeds, to be purchased before March 10th, to supply impoverished households who cannot afford seeds, and to mobilize the masses to buy their own. 2. Purchase farm tools. In order to facilitate women hoeing two or three times, 500 small hoe blades will be purchased from Yuxian County. 3. Develop sideline occupations. Seize the gaps during spring plowing to organize the masses to dig 500,000 jin of medicinal herbs. Organize the masses to cut timber, mainly wooden spindles, and collect 2 million pieces of caps, handle pieces, etc. In the autumn, mobilize the masses to eliminate harmful animals and purchase a large quantity of wild animal skins. 4. Focus on issuing grain and loan credits, overcome egalitarianism and charitable viewpoints, and issue loans in an organized and planned manner in conjunction with organizing mass production. Use grain and loan credits to support carpenters and blacksmiths to specialize in making farm tools. 5. Supply farmers with daily necessities. Purchase 35,000 jin of sea salt and 28,000 chi of coarse cloth. 6. Organize village cooperatives, organize pig raising, and cultivate one to three credit village cooperatives in one district to replace the credit department, issue grain and loan credits, and encourage private credit. Cultivate a group of technical talents in economic work.

　　涞水推进社计划购买种籽
  　帮助农民种植花生棉花
    【张垣电】涞水县生产推进社检查去年工作，制定今年生产计划。该县山多地少，一般农民光靠土地维持不住生活，必须从搞副业、砍柴卖木料中来贴补。推进社针对这一情况即于去春号召群众“靠山吃山”，组织砍木货、刨药材、采山茶、打麻乌皮、打麻拉叶（染料），消灭害兽等副业生产。该社供销部推销出山货，买回了土布、海盐、锅、农具、棉花等物品，以低于市价卖给农民。这样，不仅解决了群众不少困难，还得到纯利冀钞五千一百三十八万四千九百四十元。去年春粮荒时，信用部在全县贷出粮二十四万八千四百三十四斤，发放到一百六十三个村，受益户四千六百户、两万一千三百人，大致解决了春种夏锄的食粮问题。全年用贷款买到牛、驴二百四十头，秋、冬两季扶助小手工业者、小生产者共四十四户，冬季贷款冀钞三千五百四十五万元，受益户一百六十家。该社接受去年经验教训，根据今年大生产任务订出了今年计划：一、为了保证种花生七千亩、种棉五千亩的任务完成，拟派专人购买花生种一万斤，种棉五千斤，三月十日前买齐，供给买不起籽种的贫困户，并要发动群众自买。二、购买农具。为了便利妇女锄二、三遍，从蔚县买小锄板五百张。三、发展副业。抓紧春耕空隙，组织群众刨药材五十万斤。组织群众砍木货以木锭子为主收二百万根盖子、权股子等，秋后发动群众消灭害兽，大量收买野兽皮。四、有重点的发放贷粮贷款，克服平均主义思想与恩赐观点，有组织有计划的发放贷款结合组织群众生产。用贷粮、贷款扶助木匠、铁匠们专门打造农具。五、供给农民日用品。买海盐三万五千斤，大布二万八千尺。六、组织村社，组织养猪，并在一个区培养一个到三个信用村社，代替信用部，发放贷粮贷款，鼓励私人间的信贷。培养一批经济工作中的技术人材。
