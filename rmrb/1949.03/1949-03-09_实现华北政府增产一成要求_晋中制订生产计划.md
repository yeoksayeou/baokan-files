Jinzhong Formulates Production Plan to Achieve North China Government's 10% Production Increase Requirement

[Jinzhong Electric Dispatch] In response to Chairman Mao's call for "an inch more in production" and to concretely realize the North China Government's requirement for a 10% increase in production this year, the Jinzhong Administrative Office convened an expanded cadre meeting from the 10th to the 19th of last month to discuss and formulate this year's agricultural production plan. Over 200 cadres from various units attended. At the meeting, Comrade Xie Xuegong, Deputy Secretary of the Jinzhong District Party Committee, delivered a report, emphasizing that feudal exploitation has been eliminated in areas with 2 million of the region's 2.7 million people, and land adjustment will be implemented in the remaining areas before the spring plowing. Coupled with the state-owned economy's support for agricultural production, there are conditions to launch this year's large-scale production campaign on the existing foundation. He urged leading organs at all levels to ensure that production leadership is given top priority. Subsequently, Comrade Niu Yinguan, Director of the Administrative Office, reported on the district's 1949 production plan, proposing a 10% increase in production in both old and new areas, with the goal of increasing fine grain production by 600,000 shi (石) throughout the district this year. Old areas should focus on intensive cultivation, new areas should strive to eliminate two-thirds of the wasteland, and disaster areas should focus on production to overcome the famine, without setting production increase targets. Secondly, taking advantage of Jinzhong's favorable conditions for cotton planting, the district should plant 250,000 mu (亩) of cotton, with an estimated yield of 25 jin (斤) of ginned cotton per mu, yielding a total of 4.25 million jin of ginned cotton to supply raw materials for urban cotton yarn. At the same time, more oil crops, early-maturing crops, yams, and sweet potatoes should be planted to supplement the grain shortage and solve the difficulties faced by disaster areas before the new harvest. Director Niu pointed out that in order to mobilize all forces and ensure the completion of this year's production plan, it is necessary to focus on solving the following problems: (1) Organize mutual aid and women's participation in agricultural production to increase labor force; (2) Increase the purchase and breeding of livestock to solve the shortage of animal power; (3) Repair water conservancy facilities; (4) Solve the shortage of agricultural tools and seeds, and increase fertilizer; (5) Provide loans with a focus; (6) Actively lead production for disaster relief in disaster areas. Director Niu emphasized in his report that the Japanese invaders and Yan Xishan bandits' conscription and plundering had greatly damaged rural productivity. Based on the current land situation in Jinzhong, the existing male labor force can only cultivate 67.6% of the land. The district currently has 30,000 head of livestock, and based on 50 mu of land cultivated per head, there is still a shortage of 100,000 head. According to actual possibilities, the district is required to breed and purchase 20,000 head of livestock this year. Banks can provide loans to organize support. Due to the lack of labor, organizing women to participate in production is very important. According to incomplete statistics, there are 250,000 women with full labor capacity in the district, and half of them are required to participate in agricultural production this year. At the same time, it is necessary to strengthen labor mutual aid organizations to improve labor efficiency and supplement the labor shortage. In the final part of his report, Director Niu emphasized that all localities should overcome spontaneous flows and strengthen the organization and leadership of production, and pay attention to the implementation of various policies related to the production campaign. Fair and reasonable burden and war service are very important. At the end of the conference, Comrade Zhang Gan, Deputy Director of the Administrative Office, answered the questions raised in the discussions and pointed out that all localities must widely conduct spring plowing mobilization among cadres and the masses, call on the broad masses of peasants to actively engage in production and become prosperous through labor, and carry out this year's large-scale production campaign with leadership. In order to ensure the smooth progress of this year's production, except for military service mobilization, all rear areas will suspend service mobilization to avoid wasting manpower and animal power and hindering production.

　　实现华北政府增产一成要求
  　晋中制订生产计划
    【晋中电】为响应毛主席“生产长一寸”的号召，具体实现华北政府今年增产十分之一的要求，晋中行署于上月十日至十九日，召开全区扩干会议，讨论与制定今年农业生产计划。到会各单位干部达二百余人。会议首由晋中区党委副书记解学恭同志作报告，他着重指出：现全区二百七十万人中，已将有二百万人口的地区，消灭了封建剥削制度，其余地区也将在春耕前实行调剂土地。加以国营经济对农业生产的扶植，就使在现有的基础上，有条件开展今年的大生产运动。各级领导机关务希保证将生产领导放在主要位置。次由行署主任牛荫冠同志报告了全区一九四九年的生产计划，提出今年不论在老区或新区，以增产十分之一为目标，全区今年要求增产细粮六十万石。老区着重精耕细作，新区争取将荒地消灭三分之二，灾区则以生产渡荒为主，不作增产计划。其次，利用晋中植棉的有利条件，全区植棉二十五万亩，每亩按产净花二十五斤计算，可收净花四百二十五万斤，以供给城市棉纱原料；此时应多种各种油料作物与早熟作物及山药、红薯，以补粮食不足，解决灾区青黄不接困难。牛主任指出：为了动员一切力量，保证完成今年的生产计划，必须着重解决下列几个问题：（一）组织互助，组织妇女参加农业生产，以增加劳动力；（二）增购、繁殖牲口，以解决畜力不足之困难；（三）整修水利；（四）解决农具、种籽困难，增加肥料；（五）有重点的发放贷款；（六）积极领导灾区的生产渡荒。牛主任在报告中着重指出，由于日寇与阎匪的抓丁抢掠，对农村的生产力有极大的破坏，就目前晋中的土地情况看，现有男劳动力只能耕种土地的百分之六十七点六，全区现有牲口三万头，按每头耕地五十亩计算，尚缺十万头。按实际可能，今年要求全区繁殖与购买牲口两万头。银行可以贷款组织扶植；由于劳力缺乏，组织妇女参加生产就十分重要；据不完全统计，全区共有妇女全劳力廿五万，今年要求组织一半参加农业生产。同时必须加强劳力互助组织，提高劳动效率，以补助劳力之不足。牛主任在其报告的最后一部分中，强调各地应克服自流现象，加强对生产的组织与领导；并注意贯彻有关生产运动的各项政策。如负担及战勤的公平合理，十分重要。大会最后，由行署副主任张干承同志，就大会讨论中所提出的问题，加以解答并指出：各地必须在干部与群众中广泛地进行春耕动员，号召广大农民积极生产，劳动致富，有领导的开展今年的大生产运动。为了保证今年生产的顺利进行，除动员军事勤务外，后方一律停止动员勤务，以免浪费人畜力，妨碍生产。
