　　Chahar Province Women's Federation Issues "March 8th" Instructions:
　　Calling on Women to Produce and Support the Front
　　[Zhangjiakou Dispatch] The Chahar Province All-Circles Women's Federation issued instructions commemorating "March 8th" International Women's Day. The instructions pointed out: Under the general task of consolidating and building Chahar Province and vigorously supporting the front, we must focus on production, actively organize and mobilize the broad masses of women to support the front, and strive for the complete liberation of all of China. In old and semi-old areas, it is necessary to thoroughly and comprehensively mobilize women to participate in production, launch production competitions, reward production models, and formulate production plans with emphasis. It is required that every woman with labor power should learn at least one production skill. At the same time, cultural and health work should be carried out in conjunction with production. New areas should mobilize women to participate in land reform, raise the class consciousness of working women, and carry out propaganda and education on production policies. It is necessary to emphasize that only by producing well can women's property and land rights be effectively guaranteed, and to publicize that labor is glorious, so as to quickly mobilize women to switch to production after the end of land reform. In cities, it is necessary to deeply publicize our various policies, expose the enemy's various deceptive propaganda, dispel the masses' ideological concerns, and introduce various model deeds of women in old areas participating in production, supporting the front, and participating in politics, so as to establish the view that labor is glorious. Regardless of the region, it is necessary to focus on production, pay attention to solving women's personal sufferings in a timely manner, and eliminate all obstacles in labor production, so that women can be fully active in this year's large-scale production campaign. Female comrades in various agencies, troops, schools, and factories should commemorate "March 8th" by thoroughly conducting ideological examinations and tests in the spirit of self-criticism. All female comrades should emphasize learning and formulate personal learning plans according to their own cultural and theoretical level; and call on every female cadre to learn a production skill, so as to personally take action to more effectively lead production. In order to implement this spirit, the instructions determined that various propaganda and mobilization activities should be carried out from the 26th of this month to the 7th of March where conditions permit. Regarding the form of commemoration, various types of meetings, such as representative meetings, mass meetings, and symposiums, can be held in various places according to specific circumstances. Those agencies, troops, and schools with a large number of female comrades may prepare commemorations by their own agencies, while those with fewer female comrades may be convened by the Women's Federation for joint commemoration or free joint commemoration, which will be flexibly decided according to different situations in various places.
