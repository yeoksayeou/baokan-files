Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 20th: Reports from various sources: Workers in various parts of Italy continued demonstrating on the 17th. Steel factory strikers in Terni (100 kilometers north of Rome), while holding a demonstration protesting Italy's participation in the North Atlantic Treaty, were attacked by police, who opened fire with automatic rifles, killing one worker and injuring nine. In Milan, tram and bus workers held a short strike. Government police attacked demonstrating workers, injuring several and arresting several others. Similar demonstrations took place in other large industrial cities such as Turin, Savona, and Naples. When demonstrators in Rome demonstrated around the parliament, they were also attacked by police, and 150 people were arrested.

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 20th: Reports from various sources: As of the 18th, the Italian Parliament was still fiercely debating the issue of the reactionary Gasperi government's decision to join the North Atlantic aggressive bloc. For eighteen hours, from 3:00 AM on March 17th to 8:00 PM on the same day, members of parliament from the Communist Party, the Socialist Party, to independent leftists spoke out against the government's reactionary decision. Communist MP Amendola, speaking on behalf of the working people of Southern Italy, said: "We do not want to turn Naples into a new Singapore for the United States in the Mediterranean" (meaning an base of aggression). Communist MP Pajetta said that the Italian people would relentlessly fight back against those who voted in favor of the North Atlantic Treaty, that is, those who voted in favor of war. Communist MP Arrigo Togliatti said to the government's majority party: "You will not be able to disregard the fact that for a full eighteen hours, the voices of millions of true Italian citizens have been calling out in this chamber against your decision to join the North Atlantic Treaty. You will continue to hear this voice incessantly within the country. Our warriors who defend peace, after this battle, will be even stronger and more tempered." Socialist MP Lissuci said: "None of us will betray the responsibility entrusted to us by our voters, which is to defend peace, and therefore I oppose the North Atlantic Treaty." Socialist MP Cremaschi said: "Do not harbor illusions. The weapons you give to the peasants will not be used by them for war, but to end the war, as they did during the war of liberation."

During the debate, there were repeated and fierce clashes between the government's majority party and the opposition parties opposing the Atlantic Pact, and the meeting was repeatedly interrupted. When news of the shooting of demonstrating workers in Terni by the police reached the parliament, chaos immediately erupted in the hall. Communist MPs shouted "Murderers!" and "Criminals!" at the government. The General Secretary of the Italian Communist Party's General Confederation of Labor, Vittorio, and others questioned the government as to what measures it intended to take against the murderers in Terni.

By 8:00 AM on March 18th, approximately 150 MPs had spoken out against the government's reactionary policies, and more than 20 were still waiting to speak.

　　意各地工人继续示威
    抗议参加大西洋公约
    【新华社陕北二十日电】各方报道：意大利各地工人十七日继续示威，特尔尼（罗马以北一百公里）钢铁工厂罢工工人在举行抗议意大利参加北大西洋公约示威时，警察攻打示威者，并以自动步枪射击，杀死工人一人，伤九人。在米兰，电车和公共汽车工人举行短期罢工。政府警察对示威工人进行攻击，示威者数人受伤，数人被捕。在其他大工业城市，如都灵、萨窝那和那不勒斯，都有同样的示威。当罗马示威者在议会周围示威时，也被警察攻击，并有一百五十人被捕。
    【新华社陕北二十日电】各方报道：意大利议会至十八日为止，仍在激烈地辩论加斯贝利反动政府决定参加北大西洋侵略集团问题。从三月十七日上午三时至当天下午八时的十八小时中，从共产党社会党到独立的左派议员们均纷纷发言，反对政府的反动决定。共产党议员亚门多拉代表南意劳动人民发言说：“我们不想使那不勒斯变成美国在地中海的新加坡”（意即侵略基地）。共产党议员巴知达发言说，意大利人民将无情地反击那些投票赞成北大西洋公约，即赞成战争的人。共产党议员阿里加塔向政府多数党说：“你们将不能不考虑到整整十八小时，这议会厅里发出了真正意大利千百万公民的呼吁，反对你们参加北大西洋公约的决定。你们将在国内继续不断地听到这种呼声。我们保卫和平的战士们经过这次战斗，将更为强大、更有锻炼。”社会党议员李苏西说：我们没有一个会背叛选民所委托给我们的责任，这个责任就是保卫和平，因此我反对北大西洋公约。社会党议员克列马奇称：“你们不要抱幻想。你们交给农民的武器，将不是被他们用于战争，而是用于结束战争，象他们在解放战争中所曾作的那样。”
    在辩论过程中政府的多数党和反对大西洋公约的反对党之间，反复发生剧烈的冲突，会议屡次中断。当特尔尼示威工人被警察枪杀消息传至议会时，会场立即发生骚乱。共产党议员们向政府高呼“凶手！”“罪犯！”意共议员总工会总书记维特瑞奥等人并质问政府究竟打算对特尔尼凶手采取何种措施。
    到三月十八日中午八时前，发言反对政府反动政策的议员约达一百五十名，等待发言者尚有二十余人。
