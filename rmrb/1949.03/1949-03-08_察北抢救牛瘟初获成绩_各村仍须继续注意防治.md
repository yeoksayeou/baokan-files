　　Chahar North Achieves Initial Success in Rinderpest Control
  　Villages Must Continue to Pay Attention to Prevention and Control
    [Zhangjiakou Electric Dispatch] The rinderpest epidemic in Duolun, Baoyuan, Kangbao, Chongli, and Pingbei, Si Hai, Chicheng and other counties in northern Chahar Province, after the emergency rescue by medical teams dispatched by the North China and Chahar Provincial People's Governments and cadres at all levels, has achieved significant results in some areas. For example, in Chicheng County, the outbreak of rinderpest immediately aroused high attention from the leadership. In accordance with the instructions of the Provincial and Prefectural governments: the county quickly mobilized the villages, called on Party members to play a guaranteeing role, stipulated disciplinary measures for rewards and punishments, organized inspection teams to conduct in-depth inspections, strictly managed checkpoints, strictly quarantined infected cattle, and intensified medical treatment. As a result, most areas quickly stopped the spread and gradually eliminated the disease. However, in some areas, the leadership still has some serious shortcomings and errors. As of the 25th of last month, the cattle market in Baoyuan City had not been disbanded, and the raw meat of dead cattle was still sold arbitrarily; cattle carts in the epidemic area and non-epidemic area on the Pingdingbao to Baoyuan line were still traveling back and forth, and hides, bones, and manure were discarded everywhere; some masses did not accept scientific medical methods, and the medical team itself did not thoroughly register injections, resulting in a considerable number of omissions in prevention and treatment. For example, 100 cattle in Boluo Manbu Village refused prevention and treatment, and only 47 out of 79 cattle in Da Zhan Tu and other three villages were injected, so the expected results were not achieved. If this serious situation continues to develop, it will still develop into a major disaster. To this end, the Provincial Government has once again issued an emergency instruction, in addition to reiterating the previous order to mobilize cadres and the masses in the epidemic area to concentrate all their efforts on isolating diseased livestock and other prevention and control measures. This instruction particularly emphasizes that staff must firmly and conscientiously implement, patiently persuade and forcibly implement immunization injections to prevent omissions, and must not accommodate backward thinking, so as not to harm the interests of the majority of the masses. In areas affected by the epidemic and areas close to the epidemic, the masses should be mobilized to establish "Rinderpest Prevention and Control Conventions" on a village basis, which should be discussed and implemented democratically by the masses.

　　察北抢救牛瘟初获成绩
  　各村仍须继续注意防治
    【张垣电】察哈尔省北部多伦、宝源、康保、崇礼及平北、肆海、赤城等县的牛瘟，经过华北及察哈尔省人民政府所派的医疗队及各级政府民众干部的紧急抢救以来，已在部份地区获得显著成绩。如赤城县自发生牛瘟后，立即引起领导上的高度重视，按照省府、专区指示：迅速动员各村，号召党员起保证作用，规定了奖惩纪律，组织检查团深入检查，严格管理岗卡，认真隔离瘟牛，并加紧医疗，因而大部地区迅速停止蔓延，逐渐扑灭。但有的地区领导上，仍有若干严重缺点和错误，截至上月二十五日止，宝源城内牛市尚未解散，死牛的生肉仍任意出卖；平定堡至宝源线的疫区与非疫区牛车仍然往来不断，皮骨粪。到处抛弃，有的群众不接受科学的医疗方法，加之医疗队本身登记注射也不彻底，致使遗漏防治者为数不少。如勃落蔓布村有一百头牛拒绝防治，大展图等三村七十九头牛只注射四十七头，以致未能收到预期效果。这种严重情况，如再继续发展下去，仍会演成巨灾。为此，省府再次发出紧急指示，除重申前令动员疫区干部群众集中全力隔离病畜等防治办法外，这次指示中特别强调工作人员要坚定认真实行，耐心说服强迫免疫注射，防止遗漏者，不得迁就落后思想，以免损害多数群众利益。疫区与接近疫区的地方，应发动群众以村为单位订立“牛瘟防治公约”，由群众民主讨论实行。
