　　Introduction to the North China Health School
    Xin Fu
    In order to carry out mass health campaigns and to make health work widespread and deeply rooted in rural areas, the North China People's Government decided to establish the North China Health School to train a large number of medical technicians and health work cadres. This school officially opened on February 1st, with a total of more than 270 students. They come from different regions and different work positions. Among them are old traditional Chinese medicine practitioners in their forties and fifties, Western medicine practitioners with more than ten years of work experience, nurses, midwives, as well as district and village cadres and a small number of rural women. When they first came, each person held different ideas and requirements. Some Western medicine practitioners wanted to pursue advanced studies and learn profound theories and techniques, so that they could open regular hospitals in big cities in the future. Some traditional Chinese medicine practitioners were afraid of being eliminated in the future and wanted to find a way out through this. District cadres wanted to learn a little skill in their studies so that they could connect with the masses in their work.
    In order to solve this problem, the school first researched and analyzed these ideas, and held group chat meetings. First, let the students from the countryside talk about the various misfortunes of their relatives and friends. When some people talked about infants being torn apart by midwives during childbirth, pregnant women being torn apart and committing suicide during dystocia, and some unbearable pains, as well as the lack of medical technology, which caused some pregnant women or infants to die tragically or prematurely in the countryside, the students were deeply moved and inspired to serve the people out of diseases and suffering. They strengthened their view of learning medical skills to serve the countryside.
    According to the students' level and technical skills, the school is divided into doctor, acupuncture, and midwifery classes. The acupuncture class has a total of 73 people, most of whom have been engaged in medical work. At the beginning, some Western medicine practitioners assigned to the acupuncture class had preconceived notions about traditional Chinese medicine and thought that acupuncture was unreasonable. However, after listening to Principal Zhu's introduction on acupuncture treatment methods, they began a new transformation, realizing that it is a simple and easy treatment method very suitable for rural China and a valuable legacy in Chinese medicine. Under the conditions of lack of medical technology in rural China, it is often more effective than drugs in many diseases. After scientific research, acupuncture not only simply stimulates nerves, but also enhances the function of antitoxins and blood cells in the human body. It transformed the antagonistic thinking of some students and improved everyone's enthusiasm for learning. In addition to acupuncture, the acupuncture class also includes physiology, anatomy, infectious disease, cytology, and pathology. In these courses, the past so-called "Yin-Yang Five Elements" of traditional Chinese medicine and the wrong understanding of the human physiological structure were criticized. A traditional Chinese medicine practitioner said: "Traditional Chinese medicine books tell me: 'If the disease is on the left, prick the right; if the disease is on the right, prick the left.' It turned out to be due to the principle of nerve crossing. I was confused for a lifetime, and now I understand." Secondly, there are more than 70 students in the midwifery class, and more than 50 students in the doctor class. Most of these students have some experience and knowledge in medical work. There are doctors, nurses, head nurses, etc. Their main purpose is to improve their skills so as to better serve the countryside. In addition to the more than 190 students in the above three classes who are currently studying, the remaining more than 80 people have been assigned to work in the countryside after short-term training.
    In education, the school paid attention to the following points: (1) Strengthening ideological education so that every student truly recognizes the importance of rural health work and is determined to dedicate themselves to this great cause; (2) Starting from the existing material conditions and level of the countryside, paying attention to promoting China's acupuncture treatment method, and combining it with scientific theories to research and improve it; (3) Grasping production and childcare work, cultivating production workers, and transforming the past backward and unscientific delivery methods to reduce the infant mortality rate; (4) In teaching methods, starting from reality, teaching what is needed, teaching what is important, and being easy to understand.
    In learning, the method of "mutual teaching" and "mutual learning" is adopted to contribute all kinds of different experiences. At the beginning, some experienced doctors had conservative ideas and were unwilling to introduce their experiences. For example, Mr. Zhang Jiulian, who had been a traditional Chinese medicine practitioner for more than 20 years, was initially unwilling to talk about his experience. However, after studying and discussing, he realized the error of this conservative thinking and realized that in the new society, all technologies and experiences should serve the entire people. His thinking changed, and he enthusiastically helped everyone learn and introduced his acupuncture method to everyone, which further encouraged everyone's enthusiasm for learning. Mr. Zhang also received more respect from all the students.
    The health school is advancing towards a new road. In its continued efforts, we will see that it will bring new hope to the rural people, and people will be happier and healthier because of it.

　　华北卫生学校介绍
    辛夫
    华北人民政府为了开展群众性的卫生运动，使卫生工作普遍与深入农村，决定成立华北卫生学校，培养大批医疗技术人员与卫生工作干部。这个学校于二月一日正式开学，共有学员二百七十多名。他们来自不同的地区和不同的工作岗位。其中有四五十岁的老中医，也有十多年工作历史的西医，有护士、助产士，也有区村干部和少数的农村妇女。他们初来时，每个人都抱着不同的思想和要求，有的西医要求深造，学习高深的理论和技术，将来好到大城市开正规医院，有的中医则怕将来被淘汰，想借此找到一条出路；区干部则想在学习中学到一点本领，以便于在工作中联系群众。
    为了解决这个问题，该校首先对这些思想作了研究和分析，分组举行漫谈会，先让来自农村的学员讲述自己亲戚朋友的种种不幸遭遇；当有的人谈到婴儿在生产时被接生婆撕掉四肢，产妇在难产中被撕破脂肠和一些不能忍受的痛苦而自杀，以及由于医药技术的缺乏，而致农村中有的产妇或婴儿惨死或夭亡，当谈到这些时，使学员们受到了深刻的感动，激发了他们从疾病与苦难中去为人民服务的决心与热情。坚定了他们学好医术为农村服务的观点。
    根据学员的程度和技术水平，学校共分为医生、针灸、助产三班。针灸班共七十三人，其中大部分都曾从事过医务工作。开始时分配在针灸班的一部分西医对中医原来就抱有成见，认为针灸是不合理的，但听过朱校长关于针灸治疗法的介绍以后，开始了一个新的转变，认识到它是中国农村很适用的简便易行的治疗方法，是中国医学上的宝贵遗产，在中国农村医药技术缺乏的条件下，在许多病症上它往往比药物更为有效。经过科学的研究，针灸不仅单纯的刺激神经，并且还有增强人体内抗毒素与血球的功能。转变了某些学员互相敌视的思想，提高了大家学习的热情。针灸班除针灸以外并附有生理解剖、传染病学、细胞学及病理学等，在这些课程中，批判了中医过去的所谓“阴阳五行”及对人体生理结构的错误认识。一个中医说：“中医书告诉我：‘病在左则刺右，病在右则刺左’，原来是由于神经交叉的原理，糊涂了一辈子，这一下才明白了。”其次是助产班有学员七十多名，医生班有学员五十多人，这些学员中大都有一些医务工作的经验和知识，这里面有医生、护士，看护长等，他们主要是提高技术以便更好的为农村服务。除以上三班正在学习中的一百九十多人之外，其余八十多人，经短期训练后已分配到农村进行工作。
    在教育上，学校注意了以下几点：（一）加强思想教育，使每一个学员真正认识到农村卫生工作的重要，决心献身于这一伟大事业；（二）从农村现有的物质条件和水平出发，注意推动中国的针灸治疗法，并结合科学的理论，加以研究提高；（三）抓紧生产保育工作、培植生产工作者，改造过去那些落后的、不科学的接产方法，以减低婴儿的死亡率；（四）在教学方法上从实际出发，需要什么讲什么，什么重要讲什么，要通俗易懂。
    在学习上则采取“互教”、“互学”的方式，把各种不同的经验都贡献出来。开始时有些有经验的医生，存着保守的思想，不愿将自己的经验介绍出来，如曾当过二十多年中医的张久廉老先生，开初不肯谈出他的经验，但经过学习讨论，使他认识到这种保守思想的错误，认识到在新的社会中一切技术和经验都应该为全体人民服务。他的思想转变过来了，他热心的帮助大家学习，向大家介绍了他的针灸法，这更鼓舞了大家的学习热情。张老先生也更加得到了全体同学的尊敬。
    卫生学校正在向着新的道路前进，在它的继续努力中，我们行将看到它将给农村人民带来新的希望，人们将会因它更加幸福和健壮。
