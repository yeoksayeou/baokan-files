Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 22nd: Reports from various sources: World progressive public opinion is exposing the aggressive nature of the North Atlantic Treaty.

*Italian Communist Party "Unità"*

In Italy, the Communist Party newspaper "Unità" commented on the full text of the North Atlantic Treaty, pointing out that it exceeded all the speculations in the Western newspapers. The openly aggressive purpose of the treaty is manifested in its Articles 4, 5, 6, 9, 10, and 11. Article 4 reaffirms that the Atlantic countries will consult on the domestic problems of each country. This clause allows the United States to believe that it can authorize all kinds of Gasperis to interfere in the internal affairs of European countries. Article 5 states that the Atlantic countries can arbitrarily decide on the issue of aggression without going through the Security Council. In this way, the principle that the Security Council should be appealed to first in the event of war is violated. Article 6 emphasizes the aggressive nature of the treaty. Any signatory to the treaty only needs to provoke whenever and wherever it pleases, sink a ship or shoot down a plane, and can use it as an excuse to take the "security" measures stipulated in the treaty, and thus launch a war of aggression. Article 9 of the treaty stipulates the establishment of a council and various "auxiliary" bodies subordinate to it, especially the Defense Committee, which constitutes a real war weapon in the hands of Western militarists. These imperialists subordinate the interests of the contracting states to the military and strategic interests of the most powerful among them.

*Italian Socialist Party "Avanti!"*

The Socialist Party newspaper "Avanti!" stated: "Now that the treaty has been published, its articles are before the eyes of all Italians. What else can people find in it besides stimulating a mad arms race? Italian financial newspapers have already said that the most profitable investment is investment in heavy industry. This is said when the wounds of the last war have not yet healed! Mothers, wives, and sisters of the working people! This is the prospect that those who rule Italy are unfolding before you! It is your duty to fight by all means against the realization of these goals. The future of the motherland demands this, your right to survival demands this."

*Danish Communist Party "Land og Folk"*

The Danish Communist Party newspaper "Land og Folk" wrote that no article of the North Atlantic Treaty conforms to the interests of the Danish people. It gives us only sweat, tears, and blood. We will not be able to independently solve problems such as peace and war. Because of this treaty, we are losing our military and economic independence. It deprives Denmark of its sovereignty over Greenland. The Danish people do not want to be slaves of American imperialism.

*Chicago Sun*

Several observers in New York emphasized that the North Atlantic Treaty negotiations were conducted in secret, and the US government tried to impose the treaty on the people without giving Americans a democratic opportunity for discussion. Commentator Landis revealed some facts in the "Chicago Sun" on March 15, saying: The Senate has so far only held a brief discussion on the treaty, and at that time only procedural issues were discussed, and there was no debate on "whether we are preparing for peace or war, survival or death." But Landis emphasized that even this brief discussion in the Senate aroused protests from most newspapers. Landis continued: If the Senate and the American people really debated this treaty, the Pentagon (referring to the roof where the US Department of the Army is located) would be shaken off.

### 世界进步舆论揭破  北大西洋公约侵略面目

　　世界进步舆论揭破
    北大西洋公约侵略面目
    【新华社陕北二十二日电】各方报道：世界进步舆论纷纷揭破北大西洋公约的侵略实质。
    意共“团结报”
    在意大利，共产党“团结报”评论北大西洋公约的全文时指出，它超过了西方各国报章的一切臆测。公约的公然侵略目的在它的第四、五、六、九、十与十一各条中表现出来。第四条重申大西洋各国将在每个国家的国内问题上进行磋商。这一条款使美国认为可以授权各色各样的加斯贝利们去干涉欧洲各国的内政。第五条表明，大西洋各国可以不经由安理会随意地决定关于侵略的问题。这样，规定一旦战争爆发时应首先向安理会呼吁的原则就被破坏了。第六条强调公约的侵略性质。公约的任何签署国只须在高兴什么时候，高兴什么地方挑衅，打沉一艘船或击落一架飞机，就可以作为借口采取公约中规定的“安全”措施；并从而发动侵略战争。公约第九条规定成立理事会与隶属于该会的各“辅助”机构，特别是防卫委员会，这构成西方军国主义者手中的真正战争武器。这些帝国主义者们使缔约国的利益从属于他们中间最强有力者的军事与战略利益。
    意社会党前进报
    社会党“前进报”称：“现在公约已经发表了，它的各项条款已摆在一切意大利人的眼前。除了刺激疯狂的军备竞赛以外，人们还可以从里面找到什么呢？意大利金融界报章已经说过，最有利可图的投资是对重工业的投资。说这话的时候，正是这次大战的创伤未愈的时候！劳动人民的母亲、妻子与姊妹们！这就是统治意大利的人们在你们面前展开的前景！你们的责任是用一切办法进行战斗，反对这些目的的实现。祖国的前途要求这样，你们的生存权利要求这样。”
    丹共“人民园地”
    丹麦共产党“人民园地”报写道，北大西洋公约没有一条条文符合丹麦人民的利益。它给予我们的只是汗、泪与血。我们将不能独立地解决和平与战争这类问题。由于这个公约，我们正在丧失我们的军事上与经济上的独立。它剥夺了丹麦对于格陵兰的主权。丹麦人民不愿当美帝国主义的奴隶。
    芝加哥太阳报
    纽约若干观察家强调指出，北大西洋公约谈判是秘密进行的，美国政府力图把公约强加于人民，不给美国人以民主讨论的机会。评论员兰地斯于三月十五日在“芝加哥太阳报”上披露了一些事实，他说：参院迄今仅曾就公约作简短讨论，当时仅仅讨论程序方面问题，没有辩论“我们在准备和平还是战争，生存还是死亡”。但兰地斯强调称，甚至参院的这一简短的讨论也引起了大多数报纸的抗议。兰地斯继称：如果参院与美国人民真正进行关于这个公约的辩论，五角大厦（指美国陆军部所在地的屋顶）就会被震掉。
