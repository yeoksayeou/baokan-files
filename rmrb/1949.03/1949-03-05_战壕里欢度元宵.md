　　Celebrating the Lantern Festival in the Trenches
　　Shang Yi
　　The terrain of the Nuoma position outside Taiyuan City resembles a staircase, with Taiyuan City at the foot of the stairs. We are as if on the upper floors, with a clear view of the city, the outside of the city, the Fen River in the west of the city, and the factory area outside the North Gate.

　　Before the Lantern Festival, in the trenches near Nuoma, the civilian labor brigades and the frontline troops that could be gathered were joyfully celebrating the liberation of Beiping with boiling hearts.

　　Red and green small slogans were universally hung on the crossbeams in the trenches, reading: "The People's Liberation Army is strong, only then can Beiping be liberated!" "Continue to advance, eliminate the Chiang bandit army!" ... Cloth posters, door-panel posters, frontline small newspapers, trench life, special issues celebrating the liberation of Beiping ... all kinds of company soldier newspapers appeared in the trenches. Various cartoons depicted the People's Liberation Army entering Beiping in a mighty procession. The content was simple and unadorned, immediately exciting people. The bright spring sunshine penetrated into the shelters from the exposed tops of the covered trenches. Red and green slogans, wall posters, and paper strips fluttered in the wind. How delightful it was to see the soldiers knocking on shovels and pickaxes, patting their steel helmets, and singing their self-composed ditties!

　　On the morning of the Lantern Festival, in the East Ditch of Nuoma, the cadres of the "Tianjin" Headquarters performed Yangge dances and short skits. The embarrassing appearance of Chiang Kai-shek and his foreign fathers evoked laughter everywhere. The brigade propaganda team also performed square Yangge, and the regimental propaganda team exhibited "How Beiping Was Liberated" in a series of large paintings, all of which were fascinating.

　　In the afternoon, the wave of celebration turned to the frontline positions. Each unit, by company, platoon, or squad, held celebratory ceremonies. Free speeches were made in a rush to be first. Zhao Yueliang, a new soldier who had only been in the army for seven or eight days, said: "The Kuomintang army in Beiping was beaten so badly that they had no choice but to negotiate peace. I joined the army to resolutely carry the revolution to the end and strive for lasting peace ..." Xu Keren, a newly liberated soldier, said: "The People's Liberation Army is very powerful. I was liberated from Jinan. Jinan was taken in eight days. I know that taking Taiyuan is not a problem." Yang Dabing performed drum song, and Liu Jincai sang local operas, all self-composed and self-performed. The moon was already shining in the trenches; the joyous mood of the people was still unstoppable. The one-meter-wide communication trench did somewhat restrain everyone's singing and dancing. Wang Laiyou, on sentry duty, was so anxious that he sang a few lines of improvised lyrics: "We celebrate the New Year with joy, Chiang and Yan bandits have nothing to eat and drink, drooping their heads in dejection..." He looked towards the enemy's position and saw that the streetlights in Taiyuan City were dim and lifeless, obviously Yan bandit's life was not long. "Humph! Yan Xishan! Let's see how many days you have left!"

　　The bright moon was extraordinarily bright. In the trenches, the songs, laughter, applause, and speeches celebrating the liberation of Beiping vibrated the open sky and spread to all parts.

　　战壕里欢度元宵
    尚毅
    太原市门外的淖马阵地的地形象个楼梯，太原城就在梯脚下。我们象在楼上，城里、城外、城西汾河、北门外工厂区，一眼望去，都看得清清楚楚。
    元宵节前，淖马附近的战壕里，民工大队、能集合的不能集合的前沿部队，都以沸腾的心情欢庆北平的解放。
    战壕里的横梁上，普遍地吊着红绿小标语写着：“人民解放军力量强，北平才能得解放！”“继续向前进，消灭蒋匪军！”……布面报、门板报、阵地小报、战沟生活、庆祝北平解放特刊……各种名堂的连队战士报纸都在战壕里出现了。各种漫画画着人民解放军浩浩荡荡涌进北平的行列各种内容简单质朴，一看就叫人很兴奋。明媚的春光，从盖沟的露顶处透进掩蔽部里，红绿标语，墙报纸条，随风飞舞，战士们敲着洋锹洋镐，拍着钢盔，唱着自己编的小调子，是何等痛快啊！
    元宵节上午，在淖马东沟里，“天津”部司令部干部们演秧歌、活报，蒋介石和他洋爸爸的那种狼狈相，处处引人轰笑。旅宣传队也扭广场秧歌，团宣传队展览“北平是这样解放的”，连环大画，样样引人入胜。
    下午欢庆的浪潮转到了前沿阵地了，各单位，以连以排以班，都举行着庆贺仪式，自由讲话争先恐后，才到部队七八天的新战士赵月亮讲：“北平国民党军是打的他无法了，才和平谈判的。我参军就是为了坚决革命到底，争取永久的和平……”新解放战士徐克仁说：“人民解放军力量大得很，我是济南解放过来的，济南八天就打下来了。我知道，打太原不成问题”。杨大宾说大鼓，刘进才唱＠＠都是自编自唱。月亮已经射在战壕了；大家欢腾的情绪还是不可遏止。一米宽的交通沟诚然有些抑束大家的歌舞。岗哨上的王来有急得也唱了几句乱弹：“我们过新年欢天喜地，蒋阎匪没吃喝垂头丧气。……”他对着敌人阵地望去，看见太原城里的路灯黯淡无光，显然阎匪的寿命不长了。“哼！阎锡山！看你还有几天！”
    皎洁的月亮，分外光明，战壕里庆祝北平解放的歌声、笑声、手掌声、讲话声，振荡着豁朗的天空又散播到各地。
