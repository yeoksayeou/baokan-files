Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, March 16th: Reports from various sources: The Italian people, in opposition to the reactionary Gasperi government's decision to join the North Atlantic Treaty aggressive bloc, are successively launching large-scale demonstrations and strikes. According to TASS, Rome: In Rome, approximately several thousand young men and women gathered from various locations in the city center on March 12th to demonstrate in front of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, blocking the entrance to the Ministry to protest the war-provoking conspiracy. Demonstrators shouted: "We want peace!" "Down with Sforza!" "Go fight the war yourselves!" The Youth League also distributed leaflets, stating in part: "The ruling party wants to make Italy participate in the North Atlantic Treaty, thereby dragging our country into a new war for the benefit of American imperialism. Young men and women of Rome, we remember very clearly what disasters Mussolini's Pact of Steel brought us. We will say 'no!' to those who want to send us to the slaughterhouse again! Let us unite and strive for peace and independence." Because vicious anti-Soviet and anti-democratic slogans of the Christian Democratic Party appeared in the streets, and especially after hearing the news of Gasperi's decision to join the North Atlantic Treaty, the indignation of the demonstrators increased even more. As soon as the demonstrators arrived in front of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, police on motorcycles attacked them. Police using batons and rifle butts engaged in sporadic battles with the dispersed young people. The police attacked demonstrators and pedestrians on the street. Many demonstrators and pedestrians were beaten, and dozens were arrested. On the same day, there were similar demonstrations in Naples. According to United Press Rome: Flash protests and strikes have already broken out in the industrial area of ​​northern Italy.

　　反对参加“北大西洋公约”
  　意大利人民继续罢工示威
    【新华社陕北十六日电】各方讯：意大利人民为反对加斯贝利反动政府决定参加北大西洋公约侵略集团的政策，正陆续开展大规模示威罢工运动。据塔斯社罗马讯：在罗马，男女青年约数千人于三月十二日自各地齐集市中心，在外交部前面举行示威，并封锁外交部入口，以表示抗议挑拨战争的阴谋。示威者高呼：“我们要和平，”“打倒史佛卓，”“你们自己去打仗吧！”青年联盟并散发传单，略称：“执政党要使意大利参加北大西洋公约，从而将我们国家卷入为美帝国主义的利益而进行的新战争中。罗马男女青年们，我们记得很清楚，墨索里尼的钢约给我们带来了何种灾难。我们将对那些想再度把我们送上杀场的人们说“不！”让我们团结起来，争取和平与独立。”因为街头出现基督教民主党的恶毒的反苏反民主标语，特别是听到加斯贝利决定参加北大西洋公约的消息，示威者的义愤就更增长了。示威者刚一到外交部前面，乘摩托车的警察就向示威者进攻。使用警棒和枪托的警察和分散的青年群众发生零星战斗。警察攻击示威参加者，并攻击街上行人。许多参加示威的人员、行人遭殴打，数十人被捕。同日，在那不勒斯，也有同样的示威。另据合众社罗马讯：在意北工业区已在爆发闪电式的抗议罢工。
