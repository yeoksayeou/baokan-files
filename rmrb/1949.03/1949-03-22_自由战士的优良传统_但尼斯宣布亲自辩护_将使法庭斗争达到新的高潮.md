Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, March 20th. TASS, New York, March 18th: General Secretary of the American Communist Party, Dennis, announced during his "trial" on March 17th that in all future "trials," he would not require representation by a lawyer but would defend himself personally. Dennis declared that he believes this is the best way to defend the Communist Party's doctrines and practical actions. The National Committee of the American Communist Party has issued a statement saying that Dennis's actions mark a new stage in the "trial." The statement points out that his self-representation inherits the finest traditions of American freedom fighters, and at the same time, it will be a defense of our party, the American working people, and American democracy. The statement further points out that there is no doubt that freedom-loving people all over the world will applaud this decision. This will bring the entire struggle inside and outside the courtroom to a new climax, in order to smash the conspiracy of those who oppose American democratic rights and oppose the people fighting for peace, progress, and security.

    将使法庭斗争达到新的高潮
    【新华社陕北二十日电】塔斯社纽约十八日电：美国共产党总书记但尼斯在三月十七日的“审讯”中宣布在今后一切“审讯”中，他不需要由律师代表，而由自己亲自进行辩护。但尼斯宣称：他相信这是为共产党的主义与实际行动而辩护的最好办法。美共全国委员会已发表声明称：但尼斯的做法标志着“审讯”的新阶段。该声明指出：他的自行辩护，继承着美国自由战士的最优良传统，同时这将是我们党、美国劳动人民和美国民主的辩护。声明进而指出：毫无疑问地世界各地爱好自由的人们，都将赞扬这个决定。这将使法庭内外的整个斗争达到新的高潮，以粉碎那个反对美国民主权利，反对为和平进步与安全而战斗的人们的阴谋。
