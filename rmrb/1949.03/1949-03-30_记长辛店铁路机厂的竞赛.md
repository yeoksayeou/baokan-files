　　A Record of the Competition at the Changxindian Railway Machinery Plant

　　Li Lianshan, an old worker of the "February 7th" at Changxindian, said at this year's February 7th Commemoration and the celebration of the liberation of Peiping: "We must step up production to support the front lines. Wherever the People's Liberation Army fights, we will build the railway there." The workers of the Changxindian Railway Machinery Plant have responded to Li Lianshan's call with facts. This was clearly seen in the plant's first production competition shock week after liberation, from the 14th to the 20th of this month.

　　The task was to rush-produce 10,000 fishplates in seven days and cut 2,250 meters of railway track per day. When this task was initially assigned on the evening of the 13th, Zhang Songsen, the director of the furnace workshop, was so anxious that he couldn't sleep half the night. How could seventy people cut two hundred meters of railway track a day? In the past, a team of six could only manage eighteen meters at most! But the workers were preparing one after another, determined to complete this arduous task. The next day, the director of the furnace workshop braced himself and divided the seventy-one people into twenty-five groups, stipulating that each group would complete ten meters per day; he was still not confident that they could complete it. But in the evening, the workers completed 341.05 meters, which gave him a great shock. During the summary, he was so happy that he didn't know what to say. By the 16th, the number had increased to 491.41 meters, an increase of 150.36 meters compared to the 15th. Zhang Songsen ran to the work group and said, "It's really unexpected! In the past, there was never such a thing!" The entire plant's task of cutting and chopping was originally scheduled for five days, but it was completed in three and a half days. Workers Liu Baorong, Zhao Ruiheng, and Xiao Huisan of the established field chopping team were originally only required to chop twenty or thirty meters per day, but the next day they reached 51.4 meters, and later continued to increase to more than sixty meters, with a maximum of 80.2 meters.

　　Workers Zhou Fengxiang and Wu Xien, who use the M50-502 gantry planer in the machine shop, competed to cut railway tracks, determined to cut one hundred meters per day; after work began on the morning of the 16th, they went to carry the materials themselves because the materials were not delivered in time. Zhou Fengxiang accidentally broke his hand, and blood flowed freely. Others advised him to go to the hospital to apply some medicine, but he was afraid of delaying time, so he just put some soil on the wound and continued to work. When he calculated at the end of the evening shift, he had cut thirty-six pieces, 107.4 meters long.

　　The task of the semi-finished products yard was to cut 600 meters of railway track per day. Initially, there were only twenty-four people, but in the last four days, it increased to twenty-eight people. In just three days, they cut 1207.9 meters per day. Su Hai, Sun Youting, Bao Guanghai, Ma Shan, and others were injured, but they persisted until the end of the shift.

　　As for making fishplates, during the Kuomintang rule, the highest daily record was 600 pieces; after this competition began, the daily output of fishplates reached 1,430 pieces in just one week, and each piece was twice as large as in the past. In one week, 120 tons of scrap iron were turned into solid and neat fishplates.

　　The winding group and locomotive group of the electrical shop, in addition to undertaking emergency repairs of motors and timely oiling, also automatically completed a 60-ton crane coil. The stoker team, Liu Fenghong, Zhao Zhenshan, and others, added coal, cleaned the furnace, and added water non-stop. The steam pressure gauge on the boiler always pointed between 7,000 and 8,000 kilowatts. The blue furnace fire shone on their faces covered with sweat and coal dust, but no one complained.

　　What is especially worthy of praise is the high degree of mutual assistance and cooperation displayed by the workers in various departments. In the past, the workers in the repair shop always waited for a certain department's parts to break down and need repair before going to repair them, and it would take several hours to open a slip and wait for approval. But this time it was completely different: they wrote letters to various factories, guaranteeing not to let the machine stop for even a second. This gave everyone great encouragement.

　　The reason why 10,000 railway track fishplates could be successfully completed in seven days was based on the workers' high labor enthusiasm.

### 记长辛店铁路机厂的竞赛

　　记长辛店铁路机厂的竞赛
    长辛店的“二七”老工友李连山在今年二七纪念及庆祝北平解放的大会上曾说：“我们要加紧生产，支援前线，解放军打到那里，我们就把铁路修到那里。”长辛店铁路机厂的工友们用事实回答了李连山这一号召。这在本月十四日至二十日该厂解放后第一次生产竞赛突击周中看得很清楚。
    七天要赶造一万块夹板，每日截铁道二二五○米。这一任务在十三号晚间初分配下来时，制炉主任张松森急得半夜睡不着。七十人一天要剁断二百米铁道，这怎能办到？从前六人一班，最多也只能打十八米呀！但工人们却在纷纷准备，决心完成这一艰巨任务。第二天，制炉主任硬着头皮把七十一人编成二十五组，规定每组每天十米；能否完成，他还是没有把握。可是到了晚上，工人们完成的数字却是三四一·○五米，把他吓了一大跳。总结时他高兴的不知说什么好。到了十六日，数字竟增到四九一·四一米，比十五日超过了一五○·三六米。张松森跑到工作组面前说：“真是想不到呀！过去，从来也没有这样的事啊！”全厂截断、剁头的任务，本来预定五天的，三天半就完成了。建立场剁头小组刘保荣、赵瑞衡、萧惠三工友，原定每人只须每天剁二三十米即可，但第二天即达到五十一米四，后来继续增加到六十多米，最高达到过八十米点二。
    机器场使用Ｍ５０—５０２龙门刨床的工友周凤祥、吴锡恩突击竞赛截铁轨，立志每天截一百米；十六日早晨上班后，因材料一时运不到，他们便自己去搬取。周凤祥一不小心，碰破了手，鲜血直流。别人劝他去医院上点药，他怕耽搁时间，只在伤口上弄点土，又继续去工作。晚上放工时计算一下，竟截到三十六根，长一○七·四米。
    在制品场的任务是每天截断铁轨六百米。初时只二十四人，后四天增加到二十八人。只三天，他们就截到每天一千二百零七点九米。苏海、孙友庭、鲍广海、马山等受了伤，仍坚持到下班。
    至于制夹板，在国民党统治时期，每日最高纪录是六百块；这次竞赛开始后，仅一星期，鱼尾夹板每日即出到一千四百三十块，而且每块都有过去的两块大。一星期内就把废铁一百二十吨变成了坚实整齐的夹板。
    电机场的卷线组、机车组，除担任急修电机及时浇油外，还自动地搞好一个六十吨起重机线圈。司炉班刘凤红、赵振山等投煤、清炉、上水，片刻不停。锅炉上的汽压表针，总是指在七千瓦至八千瓦之间。发蓝的炉火照在他们涂满汗和煤烟尘土的脸上，但没有一人叫苦。
    尤其值得赞扬的，是各部门工友高度发挥了互助合作的精神。修配厂的工友过去总是要等着某一部门机件坏了需要修配时才去修配，而且修配时开条、等批准，就得花上好几个钟头。但这次可完全不同了：他们写信给各厂，保证不让机器停一分一秒。这给了大家很大的鼓励。
    一万块铁轨夹板所以能在七天内胜利地突击完成，就是以工人们这种高度的劳动积极性为基础的。
