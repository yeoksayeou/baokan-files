　　How to explain "Labor-Capital Both Benefit"?

    Q:
    Before the July 7th Incident, my relative opened a small marble mine (covering 30 ares) in Miyun County, Hebei Province. After the Japanese invasion, mining was suspended in the 30th year of the Republic of China. Now that the great liberation cause is about to be completed, my relative still wants to resume operations with the qualifications of the original miner (mine license registration certificate and related documents are all kept). However, he is unclear about the procedures for reporting resumption of operations. Please provide guidance on: (1) What are the reporting procedures? What are the procedures for renewing the license? (2) What is the annual mining tax? (3) How to explain "Labor-Capital Both Benefit"? (4) Which department is in charge of mineral resources?
    Yang Fengqi
    A:
    Here are brief answers to the questions you asked:
    1. State-owned and publicly-owned industrial and mining enterprises in the North China region are under the leadership of the Enterprise Department of the North China People's Government, while private industrial and mining enterprises are under the leadership of the Department of Industry and Commerce; however, specific local issues must first be resolved through the local Administration of Industry and Commerce, and then reported to the Department of Industry and Commerce or the Enterprise Department. Regarding the issues of resuming operations and renewing the license you inquired about, you can directly request and complete the procedures at the Miyun County Industrial and Commercial Section. The Finance Department of the North China People's Government is still studying the mining tax.
    2. "Labor-Capital Both Benefit" is the basic principle of the People's Democratic Government in handling labor-capital relations. The so-called "both benefit" means that, in order to achieve the goal of "developing production and promoting economic prosperity," the interests of both labor and capital must be taken into account, and the freedom of contract between labor and capital must be guaranteed. On the one hand, appropriately improving workers' treatment, improving workers' lives, and protecting all legitimate rights and interests of workers is necessary. Naturally, simply emphasizing the temporary interests of workers, such as excessively high labor conditions or forced employment, is also wrong. On the other hand, appropriately taking care of the interests of capital, so that all private industrial and commercial enterprises that are beneficial to the national economy can be profitable. However, the capital side must abide by the contract between the two parties, respect the legitimate political and economic rights of workers and apprentices, and must not illegally infringe upon them, such as unreasonably deducting wages, arbitrarily dismissing workers, or even arbitrarily interfering in workers' political activities (such as prohibiting workers from joining trade unions). If there are these illegal acts, the government or relevant authorities shall, according to the severity of the case, take effective measures.

### “劳资两利”如何解释？

专栏：询问与答复

　　“劳资两利”如何解释？问：
    鄙亲于七七事变前在河北省密云县境开采有小型大理石矿一座（面积三十公亩）。日寇入侵后，于民国三十年停采。今解放伟业即庆告成，鄙亲仍欲以原开采人之资格进行复业（矿照登记证及来往文件俱存），惟以不明呈报复业手续，请分神答复。（一）呈报手续如何？换照手续如何？（二）矿税每年若干？（三）劳资两利之解释如何？（四）矿产属于何部分管辖？
    杨凤起
    答：
    兹将所询问题，简复如下：
    一、华北区的国营、公营工矿业，统归华北人民政府企业部领导，私营的工矿业归工商部领导；但各地的具体问题必须首先经过当地工商局解决，然后呈报工商部或企业部。所询复业，换照问题，可直接向密云县工商科请求及办理手续，至矿业税华北人民政府财政部正在研究中。
    二、“劳资两利”，是人民民主政府处理劳资关系的基本方针。所谓“两利”，就是说，为达到“发展生产，繁荣经济”的目的，必须兼顾劳资双方的利益，保障劳资双方契约自由。一方面适当提高工人待遇，改善工人生活，保障工人一切正当权益，自然单纯强调工人的暂时利益，如过高的劳动条件，强迫雇佣也是错误的。另一方面适当照顾资方利益，使一切有益于国民经济的私营工商业都有利可图。但资方必须遵守双方契约，尊重工人学徒政治上经济上的正当权利，不得非法侵犯，如无理克扣工资，随便解雇工人，甚或任意干涉工人的政治活动（如禁止工人参加工会）等。如有这些违法行为，政府或有关机关当分别轻重，予以有效处置。
