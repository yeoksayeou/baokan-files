  　贫中农获得帮助
    【新华社陕北九日电】塔斯社华沙讯：波兰全国正在准备春季播种工作。今春计划播种八百五十五万公顷，其中三百七十四万五千公顷播种谷物。加上本年度冬季作物种植的面积，则耕种总面积将为一千四百六十八万公顷，较去年多六十万公顷。贫农与中农在准备春播的工作中获得一切帮助。政府已供给农民六十五万八千吨肥料。农民们将收到优良品种二万一千吨。今春将约有一万五千架拖拉机在田间工作。贫农与中农获得了政府发给六亿波币购买种子与肥料的贷款。此外，波兰正进行广泛供应农村电力的工作。战前每年约有三十个村庄用电，而一九四七年则有五百七十个村庄获得电力供应，一九四八年用电村庄达一千二百个。今年国家计划规定使一千三百七十座村庄电气化。
