　　Changxindian Workers' Emulation Drive
　　Zhang Lao
    Starting from March 15th, 1949, it has been five days, and the workers of Changxindian have been laboring intensely, no, practically fighting, to accomplish a glorious task.
    The task is simply a number: to complete ten thousand fishplates within a week to rush the repair of the Tianjin-Pukou Railway. However, what a heavy and arduous task this is!
    In the early morning, the tall chimneys of the Changxindian locomotive section spew thick white smoke. When it shakes off the fatigue of a night of hard work and roars comfortably in the dawn sky, workers from all directions within a dozen miles converge on it. Everyone is calculating this heavy number in their hearts, but it does not cause worry, but rather breeds honor in their hearts, full of hope for the victory of the competition. Who isn't thinking: Today everything has changed, as long as you do a bit of work, everyone will know about it! It will never again be like the past, where those high-ranking officials took all the credit.
    The locomotive pants, its heavy breathing bringing a long line of winding freight cars, lined up along rows of dark red rails, materials transported back from Fengtai in the dead of night. In the cars, the workers' tired, bloodshot eyes flash with a cheerful look. Before the train has even come to a complete stop, people are swarming around waiting. Due to the anxiety of waiting, they can't help but climb onto the cars as if churning, hoping to increase their own achievements by even a single digit, even a second of speed is valuable. A long line, thousands of moving iron rods, unfolds into a boiling crowd, pushing back and forth. The sound of the rails falling from the cars drowns out everything. A rail weighing over two hundred catties is carried by a worker, who sways his body and pushes it through the crowd.
    It is not difficult to recall the workers' own experiences. Under Kuomintang rule, twelve people could only unload two cars a day. Today, eighteen people unload eleven cars a day. This is not an improvement in machinery, it is a fourfold increase in manpower.
    On the open ground, next to rows of dilapidated locomotives, groups of people surround piles of rails. A rail lies flat, and when the bending machine is engaged, shouts rise from the group. Five or six pairs of strong arms pull on a straight iron bar. When the bending machine cuts the rail with a clang, the group collapses to the ground. But they quickly get up, pat the dust off their buttocks, and run over to set up the second rail. At the same time, another clang sounds even crisper, echoing each other, vibrating with a kind of joy. This joy is a kind of heat, and this heat is driving a number upward. The five-day task is completed in three and a half days. From the original requirement of cutting six hundred meters per day, they automatically achieve cutting one thousand two hundred and seven point nine meters per day.
    Inside the workshop, countless teams are laboring, wielding countless hammers. Thin shirts reveal strong, bulging chests, and sweat drips from the corners of smiling eyes down the cheeks. The strong posture forms a picture of the "dance of strength." The hammers strike the drill pins, a sound of metal vibrating, "Dong! Qiang!" chanting a natural melody. No one wants to say a word in this harmonious sound, only occasional bursts of laughter.
    Each rail is hammered with a deep groove, removing the small head of the soil surface, and then it can be sent to another department to be cut into steel blocks the size of fishplates.
    It is beyond imagination. In the era of Kuomintang rule, six people could only hit at most eighteen meters a day, but today! Only three people in a group, on the same day, achieve eighty point two meters. This is not an ordinary thing. The names of these three people are published in the Changxindian Workers' Small Newspaper: Liu Baorong, Zhao Ruiheng, and Xiao Hui, from the founding workshop.
    A bow spring compressor is being fully utilized. It emits great pressure. As long as it gently squeezes, a long rail goes in one end, and the other end becomes a billet of the right length. It chews day and night, and the person watching it also shares its pride in success. Originally, it was only used to compress the bow springs under the carriages, but today, before the new task at night, it also participates in the competition.
    The steam hammer, tearing its big mouth, roars as the running workers pull the red-hot billet from the blazing furnace to its feet, letting it embrace it hotly, kissing it madly! This turns it into a flat fishplate with six round and neat holes drilled in it.
    The Changxindian locomotive section is seething!
    A worker's poem says: "Labor creates the world!" Here, labor is creating glorious victory!

　　长辛店工人竞赛潮
    章烙 
    从一九四九年三月十五日起，已经是五天了，长辛店工人在为着实现一次光荣的任务而紧张的劳作，不，简直是在战斗着。
    任务只是一个简单的数字，一个星期之内完成一万块夹板，抢修津浦路。然而这该是一个多么繁重而艰苦的任务啊！
    清晨，长辛店机场组大高丛的烟筒，喷吐着浓密的白烟。当它摆脱了一夜辛勤疲劳，舒畅地在晓空长啸的时候，远近十几里的工人又从四面八方向它集结了。每个人的心里都在盘算着这个繁重的数字，但它并没有在人们心里引起忧愁，反而在内心滋生着荣誉。满含着希望竞赛的胜利。谁不在想：今天这一切都变了，只要你作出一分活，都能被人们知道的啊！决不再是过去那样，都让那些高官贵人们去报功求赏。
    火车头喘息着，沉重的鼻息带来了一长列蜿蜒的车皮，平列着一条条暗红色的钢轨，那是星夜从丰台运回来的材料。在车上，工友们疲劳腥红的眼里，闪动着愉快的神色，还没有来得及让车平稳的停下，四面就有人拥护着等待了。因为等待的焦灼，情不自禁的翻腾似的爬上车去，那怕在自己的成绩里高出一个数目字也是好的，那怕快速一秒钟，也成为可贵的时间了，一长列，千百根翻动着的铁棍，展开的是一条沸腾了的人群，来来去去的推拥着。钢轨从车上翻下来的声音，掩盖了一切，有条二百余斤的被一个工人扛起来了，他摇摆着身子硬从人群里搬了过去。
    不难记得，工友们自已有过的切身经验，在国民党统治时期，十二个人一天只能卸两车，今天，十八个人一天卸了十一车。这并不是机件的改良，这是人力的四倍的增加。
    旷场上，在一列列破旧的机车旁边，一组组的人群，环绕在一堆堆铁轨的周围。一根铁轨平躺着，当湾道机卡上去以后，吆喝的声音就从这一组里升腾了起来，五六双粗壮的臂膀，牵引着一根直立起来的铁棍。当湾道机压力把铁轨铛锒一声切断了的时候，人堆倾斜着跌倒地上去了。但是，赶紧爬起来拍打着屁股上的灰尘，跑过去，再立上第二根。就在这同时，另一个铛锒的声音响的更脆，就这样此起彼落，呼应着，震荡着一种欢悦。这欢悦是一种热力，这热力在推动着一个数目字上升，五天的任务，三天半完成了，从每天截断六百米的要求，自动的就做到每天截断一千二百零七点九米。
    屋里，罗布着无数的小组，挥动着无数的锒头，单薄的衣衫，坦露着结实突起的胸脯，汗珠从微笑的眼角顺着面夹流下去了。那健壮的姿势，构成了一幅“力”的舞蹈的图画，锒头敲打着钻钉，是一片金属震动的声音，咚！锵！和唱着自然的旋律。谁也不想在这和谐的声音里说一句话，只有偶尔一阵哄然的笑声。
    一根根的铁轨，一锤一锤的剁出一条深槽，把土面的小头去掉，然后就可以送到另外一个部门，裁断成为夹板大小的钢块了。
    决不是想象所能及的，从前在国民党统治的时代，六个人一天最多打十八米，而今天啊！仅仅只是三个人一组，一天，是完全相同的一天，却是八拾点二米。这不是一件平凡的事情，在长辛店工人小报上刊登这三个人的名字。是建立场的刘宝荣、赵瑞衡、肖惠。
    一架弓簧压缩机，被充分的使用了，它发出重大的压力，只要他轻轻的一挤，一根长长的铁轨，从这头进去，那一头就成为坯子长短的料了。它日以继夜的咀嚼着，看守它的人，也分享着它成功的骄傲，原来它只是压缩车箱下面的弓簧的。而在今天夜里新的任务之前，他也参加了竞赛。
    汽锤，呲裂着大嘴，吼叫着奔跑着的工友，从烈火熊熊的炉子里，把通红的坯子拉到它的脚下，让它火热的抱起来，狂吻啊！这样就成为一块平板的，钻了六个圆形而整齐的眼儿的夹板。
    长辛店机场翻腾起来了！
    一个工人的诗里说：“劳动创造世界”！这里，劳动在创造着光辉的胜利！
