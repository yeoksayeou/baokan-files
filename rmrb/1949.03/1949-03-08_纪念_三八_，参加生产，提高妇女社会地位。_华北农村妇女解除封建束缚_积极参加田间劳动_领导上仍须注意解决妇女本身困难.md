　　Commemorate "March 8th," Participate in Production, and Enhance Women's Social Status.
    North China Rural Women Break Free from Feudal Shackles
    Actively Participate in Field Labor
  　Leaders Still Need to Pay Attention to Solving Women's Own Difficulties
    [Our Newspaper] From the recent year's of rural construction in North China, women have made significant contributions to production, especially when male labor is scarce due to busy war efforts, women have become a great force on the production front. In terms of agricultural production: Among the region's more than 6.8 million female full-time laborers, many are fully capable of participating in all agricultural labor. According to some incomplete statistics: in Shahe, Xiyang three districts, Taiyue more than 20 villages, Jinnan three villages, Xingtai one district, Beiyue four special districts and other places, women participating in agricultural production throughout the year account for about 22% of the total female labor force. In individual places such as Nansixima Village in Raoyang, those who regularly participate in agricultural production account for more than 89% of the total female labor force. The proportion of women participating in summer hoeing and autumn harvesting is generally larger. In Yi County, Lingqiu, Gaoyang, Tang County, one village in Changzhi, and six districts in Pingtong, the proportion of women participating in summer hoeing and autumn harvesting accounts for 50% to over 84% of the total female labor force. Participating in labor is most glorious, and being lazy is most shameful has become a general public opinion. In order to improve labor efficiency, many women voluntarily form small agricultural labor mutual aid groups, and some participate in men's labor exchange groups, dividing labor with men and exchanging labor to participate in labor. This not only further enhances the labor efficiency of women, but also helps the families of martyrs and cadres who have no labor force to overcome difficulties in production: In Dongfushe Village, Lingshou, 21 of the 151 households in the village are families of martyrs and cadres, and the labor force is relatively scarce. The 27 full-time and 12 part-time laborers among the women participate in the labor exchange groups and work with men to overcome the famine. As a result of women's labor in the past year, agricultural production income accounts for about 44%, and sideline production income accounts for 78%. Because this kind of mutual assistance is based on voluntary association and equivalent exchange, it is also relatively stable. Women's labor exchange groups in Shangqing Village, Baodu, Sandi Village in Wanping, and Fanliang Village in Dacheng have persisted for four or five years. In sideline production: women also make great contributions. Most rural women participate in weaving. In many villages in the plains, every household weaves, which has become a major source of income throughout the year. According to incomplete statistics in Yi County and 153 villages in Raoyang: there are 34,738 spinning wheels in constant operation, and more than 30 women have learned new weaving techniques. In eleven villages in Guantao and Shenze counties, 244 spinning wheels earned 37,593 yuan (RMB) in twenty days. In other sideline productions such as raising livestock, digging medicinal materials, weaving mats, making and selling shoes, wool weaving, porcelain industry, and boiling saltpeter, there are also major contributions; statistics from 19 villages in Chahar Province show that 216 people made 9,607 pairs of shoes, earning 139,485 square feet of cloth, which can be used by 1,268 people based on two bolts per person per year. In Xiabajian Village, Cixian County, Zhang Aiqing's family of three women worked in the porcelain kiln. Over the years, they have bought more than ten mu of land, two mules, and built several new houses this year. Their enthusiasm for getting rich through production is very high. In some villages in Central Hebei, every family weaves pockets and belts to maintain the family's daily expenses. As a result of the support of the Party in various places for the women's liberation movement in the vast rural areas and the active participation of women themselves in production, the social and political status of many women has gradually improved. Some women have been elected as representatives of districts and villages, and family harmony and unity have also undergone unprecedented changes. Public opinion has also changed. Many people say: "Women are very active in participating in production! We can't do without them in fighting Chiang Kai-shek!" Others say: "If it weren't for my wife working with me in production, I couldn't do it alone."
    What are the main problems currently existing on the road of women's participation in production? First, many cadres do not have a sufficient understanding of the importance of mobilizing and organizing women to participate in production. Even when some work is done, it is only temporary, completing tasks for the sake of completing tasks, rather than conducting systematic and planned leadership. Some organized working women are also abandoned, so they cannot meet the requirements of women's active participation in production. For example, in Pengcheng, Cixian County, a large number of women requested to work in porcelain kilns. Participating in the porcelain industry is more suitable and interesting for them, but the leaders insisted that they engage in agricultural labor, and as a result, nothing was accomplished. In Dongshu and Taihua villages in the third district of Shexian County, women requested to be organized for production, but there was a lack of leadership, forming a phenomenon of only calling for action but no one paying attention. Some working women said: "No one tells us anything, we just produce on our own." Second, many areas regard leading production as the only content of mobilizing women and women's work. Therefore, in the context of feudal shackles not yet being completely removed, the suffering suffered by women has not been earnestly resolved. Incidents of suicide due to lack of freedom in marriage and oppression by in-laws and men continue to occur in individual places. Some women have become important labor members in the family, but they still do not have the right to participate in political activities, and are still in an oppressed position in the family. There is such an example in Xiabajian Village, Cixian County: Wu Guihua's wife worked in the porcelain kiln for more than four months, and all her wages were handed over to the family, but she could not wear a complete piece of clothing. Her husband and mother-in-law not only restricted her participation in various village meetings and activities, but also often beat and scolded her. If women who encounter this situation are not helped to coordinate their relationship with their families, their labor enthusiasm cannot be fully utilized. In this year's production plans in various places, mobilizing women to participate in labor is regarded as one of the important contents, but it must be noted that only by properly solving the above problems can mobilizing women to participate in labor not become "empty talk on paper", and this labor army, which accounts for half of the population, can play a greater role on the production front.

　　纪念“三八”，参加生产，提高妇女社会地位。
    华北农村妇女解除封建束缚
    积极参加田间劳动
  　领导上仍须注意解决妇女本身困难
    【本报讯】从最近一年来的华北农村建设中看，妇女在生产上的贡献极大，特别是在战勤繁忙男劳动力缺乏的情况下，妇女便成了生产战线上的一支伟大力量。在农业生产方面：全区六百八十多万的妇女全劳动力中，有不少是可以参加全部农业劳动的全手。据一些不完全统计：沙河、昔阳三个区、太岳廿多个村、冀南三个村、邢台一个区、北岳四专署等地，全年参加农业生产的妇女占妇女全劳动力总数的百分之廿二左右。在个别地方如饶阳南许司马村经常参加农业生产的占妇女全劳动力的百分之八十九以上。参加夏锄与秋收的妇女比例一般较大。易县、灵邱、高阳、唐县、长治一个村、平定六个区，妇女参加夏锄秋收的占妇女全劳动力的百分之五十——百分之八十四强。参加劳动最光荣，好吃懒作最耻辱，已成为一般的舆论。为了提高劳动效率，有很多妇女自愿结合组成小型的农业劳动互助组，还有的是参加男子的变工组，与男子分工，变工参加劳动。这就不但更加发挥了妇女的劳动效能，而且还可以帮助完全没有劳力的烈军干属克服生产中的困难：灵寿东富舍村，全村一百五十一户中就有廿一户烈军干属，劳力较为缺乏，妇女中的廿七个全劳动力与十二个半劳动力，都参加了拨工组和男人一起分工劳动，渡过荒灾。去年一年中，妇女劳动的结果，在农业生产收入上约占百分之四十四，副业生产收入占百分之七十八。由于这种互助是从自由结合、等价交换的基础上建立起来的，所以也较为巩固，宛平上清村、宝都、三堤村，大城樊良村等地的妇女拨工组，已坚持了四、五年之久。在副业生产上：妇女的贡献也很大，大部农村妇女都参加纺织，平原的不少村子是家家纺织，成为全年生活中的一大收入。易县全县及饶阳一百五十三个村子不完全统计：有三万四千七百三十八辆纺车经常动着，有三十多个妇女学会了新的纺织技术。馆陶、深泽两县十一个村二百四十四个纺车二十天中，赚洋三万七千五百九十三元（人民币）。其他在饲养、刨药材、编席、做鞋卖鞋、毛织、瓷业、熬硝等副业生产上，都有大的贡献；察省十九个村统计，二百一十六人做鞋九千六百零七双，赚布十三万九千四百八十五方尺，按每人每年用二匹计，可供一千二百六十八人用。磁县下拔剑村张爱清一家三个妇女在瓷窑上作工，几年来她们买了十多亩地，两个骡子，今年又盖了几间新房子，发家致富的生产热情非常高。冀中一部分村子家家妇女织口袋、织带子，维持全家零化。由于各地党对广大农村妇女解放运动的支持与妇女自身积极参加生产的结果，许多妇女在社会上、政治上的地位逐渐得到了提高，有些妇女当选为区村代表，家庭中的和睦与团结也有了空前转变。社会舆论也有变化，有许多人说：“妇女们参加生产可积极哩！打老蒋可离不了她们！”还有的说：“要不是俺孩子娘和俺一道生产，光靠俺可不行。”
    在妇女参加生产的道路上，目前存在着一些什么主要问题呢？第一是不少干部对于发动与组织妇女参加生产的重要性认识不够，即使有时进行一些工作，也只是一时的，为完成任务而完成任务，而不是进行有系统的有计划的领导。对有些已组织起来的劳动妇女也放弃领导，因而也就不能满足妇女积极参加生产的要求。如磁县彭城附近大批妇女要求上瓷窑做工，她们参加瓷业劳动是比较适宜而且有兴趣的，但领导上却硬要她们进行农业劳动，结果啥都没弄成。涉县三区东戍、台华等村，妇女要求组织起来生产，但缺乏领导，形成光有号召而无人过问的现象。一些参加劳动的妇女说：“没有人给咱说个啥，自己生产好了”。第二是有不少地区把领导生产当作是发动妇女与妇女工作的唯一内容，因而对于在封建束缚尚未彻底解除的情况下，妇女所受的痛苦，未加以认真的解决。因婚姻不自由受公婆男人压迫等而自杀的事件还不断在个别地方发生，有的妇女虽然已成了家庭中一个重要的劳动成员，但仍然没有参加政治活动的权利，在家庭仍处于被压迫的地位。磁县下拔剑村就有这样的例子：吴贵花老婆在瓷窑上做活四个多月，工资全交了家庭，但个人却穿不上一件完整衣裳，丈夫婆婆不只限制参加村中各种会议活动，而且还时常遭到打骂。遭遇到这种情况的妇女，如果不帮助她协调与家庭的关系，她们的劳动热情是不能充分发挥的。今年各地的生产计划中，将发动妇女参加劳动当成重要内容之一，但必须加以注意的是：只有适当地解决上述问题，发动妇女参加劳动才不会成为“纸上谈兵”，这支占有半数人口的劳动大军，才能在生产战线上发挥更大的力量。
