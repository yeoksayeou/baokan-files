　　Xinhua News Agency, Beiping, March 29th: Reports from various sources indicate that the French County Council elections concluded on the 27th. Due to the unreasonable non-proportional representation system employed in the election methods, and the collusion of various reactionary parties to jointly obstruct the Communist Party from obtaining the seats granted by voters, the ruling parties (Socialist Party, Popular Republican Movement, Radical Party) and the Gaullists respectively obtained 699 and 389 seats. The Communist Party, despite receiving 25% of the total votes, only secured 37 seats.

　　This non-proportional election system fully reveals the undemocratic nature of this election, resulting in a significant disparity between the seats obtained by each party and the number of votes they received. For example, in the first round of voting on the 20th (this election was originally scheduled for the 20th, but because the candidates for 785 seats failed to obtain a majority of votes, a supplementary election was held on the 27th, where the candidate with the most votes would be elected), only 17 Communists were elected, with each receiving 100,000 votes. The Socialist Party obtained 108 seats, with an average of only 11,000 votes per person, and Radical Party candidates elected 177 people, with an average of only 500 votes per person.

　　However, in Issy-les-Moulineaux, a suburb of Paris, due to the adoption of a proportional system different from the county election, the Communist Party, in alliance with the United Socialist Party and progressive Christian Democrats, won an overwhelming victory over the anti-communist bloc. They have increased from 39% of all votes in the last election (1947) to approximately 46%. They won 16 of the 33 seats, an increase of two seats, while the Socialist Party and the Gaullists each lost one seat and lost many votes.

　　Because of the adoption of a non-proportional representation system, although the Communist Party received 25% of the total votes, the most of any single party, it only has 37 of the 1,058 seats. The Socialist Party received half as many votes as the Communist Party, but received 279 seats.

　　In addition, in many areas, the Socialist Party, the parties of the so-called "Third Force," and the Gaullist movement colluded with each other, also preventing the Communists from obtaining the seats the people voted for them.

### 法县议会选举不民主　阻碍共产党人获选

　　法县议会选举不民主
    阻碍共产党人获选
    【新华社北平二十九日电】各方报导：法国县议会选举已于二十七日结束。由于选举办法是采取不合理的非比例代表制，而且各反动党派又互相纠合，共同阻碍共产党获得选民所给予的席位，以致执政党（社会党，人民共和党，激进党）和戴高乐派分别获得六百九十九席及三百八十九席，而共产党虽得票占总票数百分之二十五，却仅获三十七席。
    这种非比例制的选举法，充分的显露了此次选举的不民主，以致各党所得席位和它所获得的票数极不相称。例如在二十日第一次选举中（这次选举原定二十日举行后来因为其中有七百八十五席的竞选人未能获得过半数票，又于二十七日补行选举：只要得到最多数票即可当选），共产党人当选的只有十七人，每人得票则为十万，而社会党所得的是一百零八席，每人平均却只有一万一千票，又激进党候选人当选一百七十七人，每人平均仅有五百票。
    可是，在巴黎近郊的伊西镇，由于采用与县选举不同的比例制，共产党与左翼单一社会党及进步基督教党人联合，就赢得了对反共集团的压倒胜利。他们已自上次选举（一九四七年）中所得全部票数的百分之三十九，增至约百分之四十六。他们获得了三十三席中的十六席，增加了两席，社会党与戴高乐派各失去一席，并失去了许多选票。
    因为采取非比例代表制，所以共产党虽然获得了百分之二十五的总票数，就单个政党来说，是得票最多的，但在一千零五十八席中，却只有三十七席。社会党所得票数比共产党少了一半，却分得二百七十九席。
    此外，在许多地区，社会党和所谓“第三种力量”的政党，以及戴高乐旅互相串通，也使共产党人不能得到人民投给他的席位。
