　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 17th: Reports from various sources: On March 15th, thirty thousand laborers in the Japanese capital held a demonstration in the rain in the square in front of the Imperial Palace, protesting against the Yoshida government. The assembly was hosted by the Japanese Federation of Labor, the Government and Public Corporation Employees' Union, the National Railway Workers' Union, and other democratic organizations. Its scale was the largest since the May Day million-worker demonstration in Tokyo last year. In a sea of fluttering, bright red flags, demonstrators roared out thunderous slogans: Oppose massive layoffs of workers, oppose amending labor laws to the disadvantage of workers, and oppose levying heavy taxes. These reactionary measures are all required by the "Nine-Point Plan for Stabilizing the Japanese Economy" announced by the United States in mid-December last year, and are now being implemented step by step by its agent, the Yoshida government. Speakers at the meeting strongly protested against the reactionary policies aimed at destroying the Japanese economy for the benefit of monopoly capital, and called on all Japanese workers to unite and fight to protect their right to exist. The American military police prohibited the assembly from passing a petition and telegram to the Allied Council for Japan.

    抗议吉田执行美帝反动的政策
    号召全体职工为生存权利斗争
    【新华社陕北十七日电】各方报导：三月十五日，日本首都三十万劳工于细雨中在皇宫前面的广场上，举行了反对吉田政府的示威大会。大会系由日本产联、政府与公共机关员工职工会、国营铁道工人工会及其他民主团体所主持，其规模是去年五一东京百万工人大示威以来最大的一次。在迎风招展、鲜艳夺目的红旗大海中，示威者吼出了一阵阵雷动的口号：反对大批解雇工人、反对将劳工法作不利于工人的修改，反对征课重税。这些反动措施都是美国于去年十二月中旬所公布的“稳定日本经济九点计划”所要求的，现正由其代理人吉田政府着着实行中。会上的演说者均强烈抗议旨在为独占资本的利益而破坏日本经济的反动政策，号召日本全体职工联合起来，为保护他们的生存权利而斗争。美国宪兵禁止大会通过致盟国对日管制委员会的申请书与通电。
