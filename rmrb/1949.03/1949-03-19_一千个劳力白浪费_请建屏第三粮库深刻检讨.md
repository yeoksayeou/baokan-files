　　A Thousand Laborers Wasted in Vain
  　Please, Jianping Third Grain Depot, Conduct a Thorough Self-Criticism
    A certain agency, through the Jianping County Armed Forces Department, requisitioned laborers to transport 53,000 jin of grain straw from the Jianping Third Grain Depot to a village in the Eighth District. To avoid wasting labor, the Armed Forces Department had sent personnel in advance to complete the procedures with Luo Rufeng, the accountant of the Third Grain Depot. Both parties agreed that the Grain Depot would be responsible for distributing the straw on the 11th, 12th, and 13th days of the twelfth lunar month. However, when the County Armed Forces Department mobilized the laborers and arrived punctually at 8:00 AM on the 11th, no one at the Third Grain Depot was responsible for distributing the straw. They waited until dark, but the person in charge of distributing the straw still hadn't arrived, so the people and animals had to return home. The masses serving in the effort discussed the matter and expressed their dissatisfaction. This mobilization involved 370 donkeys, 17 mules, and 405 laborers. Counting one donkey as two laborers and one mule as three laborers, a total of 1,196 laborers were wasted. Afterwards, the Armed Forces Department negotiated with the Third Grain Depot to investigate the cause. Luo Rufeng, the depot accountant, said, "We estimated that even though the transport was scheduled to start on the 11th, the laborers wouldn't be able to come on the 12th anyway, and we were busy, so we didn't bother to distribute the straw." He also said, "Let's take this as a learning experience." Luo Rufeng's nonchalant and irresponsible attitude seriously harmed the interests of the people and should be severely criticized. It is hoped that the Jianping County Committee will help him deeply reflect on this and recognize the seriousness of his mistake to strengthen his sense of responsibility in serving the people in the future.

    Editor's Note: Zhang Ziliang's opinion was forwarded to the Jianping County Committee by the readers' service group of this newspaper. The County Committee has replied. We are publishing the original letter below:
    Regarding the responsibility issue in the Third Grain Depot's grain transportation, the original plan was to transport 53,000 jin in three days. The maximum amount to be transported on the first day should have been 18,000 jin. However, the Armed Forces Department mobilized 1,196 laborers. This many laborers could have transported 71,100 jin, exceeding the one-day transport volume by 54,000 jin. The Armed Forces Department should be held responsible for mobilizing such a large number of excess laborers.
    The details will be reported after a joint inspection by the Third Grain Depot and the Armed Forces Department.　　 Jianping County Committee

### 一千个劳力白浪费　请建屏第三粮库深刻检讨

　　一千个劳力白浪费
  　请建屏第三粮库深刻检讨
    某机关由建屏县武装部代拨劳力，自建屏第三粮库起运谷草五万三千斤至八区某村。为了不致浪费劳力，武装部曾事先派员与第三粮库会计罗如峰办妥手续，并经双方商定于旧历十二月十一、十二、十三三日由粮库负责将草发完。但当县武装部动员好劳力于十一日上午八时准时到达时，第三粮库却无人负责发草，直等至天将黑发草人仍未到，人、畜力只好返家。服勤群众纷纷议论，表示不满。此次动员牲口为毛驴三百七十头，骡子十七头，人力四百零五个，以一毛驴折二劳力，一骡子折三劳力计算，共浪费劳力一千一百九十六个。事后武装部即与第三粮库交涉追查原因，该库会计罗如峰说：“我们估计虽然规定十一号起运，十二号劳力也来不了，我们又忙，顾不上去发草”。又说：“这回作为一次经验教训吧。”罗如峰这种轻描淡写不负责任的态度，严重地危害了人民利益，应受到严厉的批评，希建屏县委帮助其深刻反省，认识其错误的严重性，以加强该同志今后对人民服务的责任心。

    编者按：张子良的意见经本报读者服务组转建屏县委会后，该县委已来回信，兹将原信一并发表于下：
    第三粮库运粮谈到责任问题，因为原订三日运五万三千斤，第一日最多应运一万八千斤，而武装部动员了劳力一千一百九十六个，这样多的劳力可运七万一千一百斤，超过了一天运送数的五万四千斤，这样多的超数动员劳力，武装部应负责任。
    这件事待三粮库与武装部共同检查后，详情再报告。　　建屏县委会
