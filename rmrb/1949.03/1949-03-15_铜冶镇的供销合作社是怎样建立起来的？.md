　　How the Supply and Marketing Cooperative in Tongye Town Was Established
    Xiao Li
    Tongye is a large town in Huolu County, with more than 700 households. Because it is backed by mountains on one side and only 30 miles away from Shijiazhuang on the other, it has always been a place for the exchange of mountain products and urban industrial goods. It was very lively before the July 7th Incident. Mountain products from Huolu, Jingxing and other counties, such as almonds, white melon seeds, medicinal materials, and stone products, were first concentrated here, and then transported to Shijiazhuang and other places for trading. After the July 7th Incident, it gradually declined due to enemy destruction. There are currently more than 120 businesses of all sizes (including resident merchants and fixed vendors in the village). A market is held every five days. Farmers from dozens of nearby villages rely on this market to sell their agricultural products and exchange them for the industrial goods they need. Therefore, commerce is quite developed.
    At the beginning of this year, the North China Supply and Marketing Cooperative Committee decided to set up a supply and marketing cooperative in the town on a trial basis to help farmers produce and reduce the exploitation of middlemen. The town was liberated in November of the year before last, and the masses have undergone preliminary mobilization and implemented land reform. However, because the Japanese and the Kuomintang reactionary government had forced farmers to buy shares in cooperatives in the past, the results were not only not beneficial, but even the shares were lost. When the democratic government called for the establishment of a supply and marketing cooperative this time, the masses were unwilling to buy shares as soon as it was mentioned. They all wanted to let others set it up first and then take a look. Therefore, the Supply and Marketing Cooperative Committee decided to find a way to operate first and then recruit members. According to the resolution of the Shijiazhuang Cooperative Conference, a loan of 300,000 yuan was first obtained from the bank as capital, and a batch of the main necessities of farmers, such as salt, alkali, and kerosene, were purchased from the trading company according to the preferential treatment measures for supply and marketing cooperatives by state-owned commercial enterprises (about 3% to 5% lower than the wholesale price of the same quality commodities in the local main market). Some towels and socks were also purchased, but in small quantities. Because the town lacks land and the harvest was not good last year, many farmers need to buy food, so some millet and white flour were also prepared.
    Before starting business, the differences between the supply and marketing cooperative and the previous cooperatives, its purpose and practices, were widely publicized among the masses. Business started on January 17th. The cooperative's listed prices were lower than the market prices on the market (such as 2 yuan cheaper for a pack of matches), and no saltpeter was mixed in the salt. On that day, more than 600 people bought things. In the evening, the cooperative sent people out to listen to the opinions of the masses, and they generally believed that this was a very good thing to do.
    Three days later, the supply and marketing cooperative began to recruit members. It was stipulated that share purchases were absolutely voluntary, based on individuals, with each person holding a share of 50 yuan (which could buy 5 kilograms of millet at the time), and future transactions were limited to members. During the initial period, it was temporarily stipulated that each member could buy 2 kilograms of salt, half a kilogram of kerosene, and half a pack of matches per month, and each could buy one pair of socks and one towel at a time. As a result, the number of people joining was very enthusiastic. Within ten days, 960 people bought shares. If it weren't for the fact that farmers needed money during the Lunar New Year, there would have been even more. In order to take care of the truly poor households, the supply and marketing cooperative specially decided that they could pay the shares in three installments, but no more than one month for the three installments. Because the purpose of the supply and marketing cooperative is to serve its members, and it is supported by national commerce and banks, the price of the cooperative's goods can be 10% lower than the market price at the lowest, and 3% lower than the market price at the highest. Therefore, as of February 14, more than 1,000 people had bought shares, including more than 30 nearby villages, and the number continues to increase. The cooperative is also preparing to establish village branches soon to wholesale goods from the town cooperative, which will further reduce the trouble for members in each village to buy goods or go to the market.
    This supply and marketing cooperative currently has six people operating it: one manager, one deputy manager, one accountant, two salesmen, and one instructor stationed in the cooperative by the North China Supply and Marketing Cooperative. These personnel all receive salary treatment, divided into three grades: 150 kilograms, 130 kilograms, and 110 kilograms of millet per month. Because it is a trial, only the "supply" part has been done. In the future, the "sales" part is also planned, that is, to buy the members' products at a price higher than the market price, supply them to state-owned commercial enterprises and other cooperatives, and then buy back production raw materials and tools to help members produce.
    During the trial period, the cooperative encountered the following problems.
    (1) Share capital issue: The original regulation was 50 yuan per share, which could buy 5 kilograms of millet at the time, but later prices rose. If 50 yuan was still taken, those who bought shares earlier would suffer. Later, it was changed to calculate uniformly based on 5 kilograms of millet, and it could also be converted into money at the market price. The refund would also be calculated according to millet.
    (2) The issue of buying shares on an individual basis: Because some things such as salt, alkali, and oil are needed by peasant families, some people asked to take the household as a unit and write the name of one person to represent the family; but many things are indeed needed by individuals. Especially women, many necessities are not taken care of by their parents, and they rely on their own money to buy them. If the household is taken as a unit, it will be restricted. Moreover, taking individuals as a unit can stimulate the role of buying shares. Therefore, in the end, it was decided to take individuals as a unit, but it can be flexibly changed.
    (3) The issue of fighting against private merchants: After the establishment of the supply and marketing cooperative, it aroused great resistance from private merchants, and the struggle was quite sharp. Because the operation of the supply and marketing cooperative hindered their high degree of exploitation of farmers. Individual merchants attempted to sabotage the operation of the supply and marketing cooperative. The cooperative sincerely and frankly explained the policies of the supply and marketing cooperative to them, that is, to reduce the high degree of exploitation of the people by merchants, so as to facilitate the development of production. They were advised not to speculate and disrupt the market and harm the national economy.
    From the trial operation of the supply and marketing cooperative in Tongye Town, the following preliminary experiences have been obtained:
    (1) First establish supply and marketing cooperatives with large commercial market towns as the center, and then gradually establish the supply and marketing network in nearby villages. It is easier and more effective than doing it village by village.
    (2) If the supply and marketing cooperative is not managed well, it is easy to lose money. The Tongye supply and marketing cooperative lost money because it had no plan and no investigation at first, and some goods were stuck and could not be sold. Therefore, it is necessary to understand the situation in advance and have a plan. It is best to calculate the consumption of members within ten days so that the capital can be turned over three times a month without losing money. The faster the turnover, the more things members can buy and the greater the benefits they can enjoy.
    (3) The supply and marketing cooperative should focus on seeking daily welfare for its members, and do not emphasize profit sharing. The masses can see from the comparison that this approach is much better than sharing dividends.

　　铜冶镇的供销合作社是怎样建立起来的？
    萧力
    铜冶是获鹿的一个大镇，有七百多户人家，因为一面靠山，一面离石家庄仅三十里地，所以一向是山货与城市工商品交换的地方。七七事变前非常热闹，获鹿、井陉等县的山货，如杏仁、白瓜子、药材、石货等，均先集中于此，然后经过交易运往石家庄等地。七七事变后因受敌人摧残，已日渐萧条。现共有大小商业（包括座商及本村固定的摊贩）一百二十多家。每五天逢集一次。附近几十个村的农民，全要靠这个集市售出自己的农产品，换回所需的工商品。因之商业相当发达。
    华北供销合作委员会今年初决定在该镇试办一个供销合作社，扶助农民生产，减少商人的中间剥削。该镇前年十一月解放，群众已经过初步发动，并实行了土地改革；但由于过去日本人与国民党反动政府都曾强迫农民入股办过合作社，结果非但未得到好处，连股金也没有了。这次民主政府号召成立供销合作社时，一提到入股，群众都不愿意，都想让别人先办起来看一看再说。于是供销合作委员会决定先设法营业，后招收社员。根据石家庄合作会议决议，先向银行贷款三十万元做资金，按国营商业对供销合作社优待办法（低于当地主要市场同一质量商品的批发价百分之三至百分之五左右），从贸易公司买了一批农民主要的必需品，如盐、碱、煤油等，也附带买了一些毛巾、袜子之类的东西，但为数不多。因该镇土地缺乏，去年收成不好，许多农民需要买粮，所以也准备了一些小米和白面。
    营业之前，即把供销合作社和以往合作社的区别，它的目的和做法，在群众中进行了广泛的宣传。一月十七日开始营业，合作社的牌价都低于集上的市价（如一包火柴便宜两元），盐里不掺硝盐。当日就有六百多人买东西。晚上该社派人出去倾听群众的意见，一般都认为这样做很好。
    三天后，供销社即开始招收社员。规定入股绝对自愿，以人为单位，每人股金五十元（当时能买小米五斤），以后交易只限于社员。在开始期间，暂定每个社员一月能买盐二斤，煤油半斤，洋火半包，袜子、毛巾一次每样限买一件。结果加入者非常踊跃。十天内入股的即有九百六十人。如果不是旧历年关农民需钱，还会更多。供销社为了照顾真正的贫苦户，又特别决定他们可以分三次缴纳股金，但三次不得超过一个月。因为供销社以服务社员为目的，又有国家商业与银行的支持，因之该社的物品，最低的可较市价低百分之十，最高的也较市价低百分之三。所以截至二月十四日止，入股者已超过一千人以上，包括了附近的三十多个村庄，并在继续增加。该社并准备很快成立村分社，从镇社批发东西，这样可更进一步减少各村社员买东西或赶集的麻烦。
    这个供销社，现共有六个人经营，经理、副经理各一人，会计一人，营业员二人，华北供销合作总社驻该社的指导员一人。这些人员一律薪金待遇，分每月小米一百五十斤，一百三十斤，一百一十斤三等。因是试办，所以只做了“供”的一部份，今后还准备办“销”的一部份，即高于市价收买社员的生产品，供给国营商业及其他合作社，然后再买回生产原料与工具等，帮助社员生产。
    该社在试办期间，曾遇到以下一些问题。
    （一）股金问题：原规定每股五十元，在当时可买小米五斤，但以后物价涨了，如仍拿五十元，早入股的人就要吃亏。以后遂改为一律按五斤小米计算，也可以按市价折钱，退股时亦照小米算。
    （二）以人为单位入股的问题：因为有些东西如盐、碱、油之类为农民家庭所需，所以有些群众要求以户为单位，写一个人的名来代表一家；但有许多东西又的确是个人需要的。尤其是妇女，很多必需的东西家长不管，全靠她们用自己钱来买。如果以户为单位，即会受到限制。而且以人为单位可起刺激入股的作用，因此，最后仍决定以人为单位，不过可以灵活变通。
    （三）与私商斗争的问题：供销社成立后，引起私商极大抵抗，斗争相当尖锐。因为供销社的营业使他们高度剥削农民受到阻碍。个别商人企图破坏供销社的营业。合作社对他们诚恳坦白的解释供销合作社的政策，就是要减轻人民所受商人的高度剥削，以利生产的发展。劝他们不要投机取巧，扰乱市场，危害国民经济。
    从铜冶镇供销合作社的试办里，初步得到下面几点经验：
    （一）先以大的商业集镇为中心，建立供销合作社，然后逐渐建立附近村庄的供销网，比一个村一个村的去做，既省力又容易获得成绩。
    （二）供销合作社如果经营得不好，很容易赔钱。铜冶的供销社即因为最初没有计划，没有调查，有些物品压着卖不出去，赔了钱。所以事先必须了解情况，有计划，最好计算出社员十天内的消费量，使资金一个月能周转三次即不致赔钱。周转得愈快，社员可以多买东西，享受的利益也就愈大。
    （三）供销社应着重给社员谋取日常福利，不要强调分红，群众可以从比较中看出这种做法比分点红利强得多。
