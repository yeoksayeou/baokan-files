　　Experiences in Transforming Newly Liberated Soldiers
    How to transform and improve newly liberated soldiers ideologically and in military techniques, so that they quickly become strong people's fighters—this is a major issue in the current military construction of the People's Liberation Army. The main experiences gained by the East China People's Liberation Army in this regard are as follows:
    (1) Unite newly liberated soldiers through Party members, cadres, and veteran soldiers in the company, starting from their daily lives and emotional needs. Influenced by the exemplary actions of Deputy Squad Leader Zhao Jingshui in the Sixth Company, Eighth Squad of a certain regiment, the new and veteran comrades in the entire squad were united as one. Once, the squad was traveling in the rain, and Deputy Squad Leader Zhao helped the newly liberated soldier Qu Ruiwu carry his gun and backpack all the way. When they arrived at the campsite, he immediately helped him dry his wet clothes. Qu Ruiwu said with emotion, "The squad leader treats me like a real brother, and I will work hard in the future." When the squad was building fortifications after continuous marching, the newly liberated soldier Guo Xianglin was unwilling to work and lay down to sleep. Deputy Squad Leader Zhao silently picked up his shovel and dug for him under the moonlight. When Guo Xianglin woke up and saw this, he felt very uneasy and immediately snatched the shovel to dig himself. During the battle of Li Lou, Deputy Squad Leader Zhao gave his own anti-artillery cave to Zhu Huangchun, a newly assigned soldier to the squad, and brought him food and water, and introduced him to the internal situation of the People's Liberation Army. Zhu Huangchun was greatly moved and firmly stated that he would also care for and love new comrades in the future. The veteran soldiers of the squad also cared for and took care of the newly liberated soldiers in every way. For example, when distributing daily necessities, the veteran soldiers let the new liberated soldiers choose first. When encountering small houses at the campsite, the veteran soldiers automatically slept outside. This spirit of unity and fraternity, with Zhao Jingshui as its core, has become the squad's excellent style.
    (2) After initially establishing an emotional relationship with the newly liberated soldiers, individual ideological assistance should be carried out to improve their political understanding. The Seventh Squad Leader of a machine gun company of a certain unit used examples to compare and educate the newly liberated soldiers. Once, a group of civilian workers were transporting bullets and food to the front, and when they passed the Seventh Squad's station, the Seventh Squad Leader asked the newly liberated soldier Mo Bochun, "Have you ever seen ordinary people helping in the Kuomintang side?" Mo replied, "The Kuomintang side has ghosts to help. Wherever they go, the people run away." The squad leader then said, "Because our troops are fighting for the people, the people are willing to support the front line. We have the help of the people, so we win battles everywhere." When distributing allowances, the Seventh Squad Leader started with the fact that officers and soldiers of the Liberation Army receive the same allowances, and explained the relationship between officers and soldiers in the Liberation Army to Mo. When he saw many prisoners, he explained the current situation starting from the fact that the Liberation Army won the battle. After listening, Mo Bochun said to the Seventh Squad Leader, "I am determined to follow the Liberation Army to the end." Sui Jingming, Deputy Squad Leader of the Ninth Squad of the First Company of a certain regiment, was studying combat movements with the newly liberated soldier Tan Changyu in an air-raid shelter. Tan said to Sui, "Why do we need to study this? The officer tells us how to fight, and we just fight." Sui immediately explained to him, "This is the glorious democratic tradition of our People's Army. The superiors care about us and ask everyone to think of ways to win battles and shed less blood." Tan listened and said, "The Kuomintang is completely different." Sui then used this to conduct a comparative education on the different styles of the two armies to Tan. Whether in the station, marching, or combat, cadres and veteran soldiers actively used the gaps to conduct individual talks with the newly liberated soldiers, which was very effective. At the same time, the positive elements among the newly liberated soldiers played a certain role in providing ideological assistance to other newly liberated soldiers. For example, Zhang Chengqian, a newly liberated soldier from the Eighth Squad of a certain regiment, said to the newly liberated soldiers who had just been liberated, "In the past, we worked for the Kuomintang, and we did whatever the squad leader said. It's different here. Everything must be done consciously and automatically." After hearing what he said, the new soldiers did all the duties very automatically.
    (3) After the newly liberated soldiers have initially improved their political understanding through individual ideological assistance, they are then subjected to grievance education to help them clearly establish the basic concept of "for whom to be a soldier, for whom to fight." Due to the environment of continuous combat, many units adopted small-scale torch grievance meetings at the squad level (to make it easier for the newly liberated soldiers to accept, they were also called "introduction meetings" or "discussion meetings"). At the meeting, methods such as asking questions, chatting, and introducing each other's experiences were used to encourage the newly liberated soldiers to express their grievances. For example, asking the new soldiers, "Where are you from? How many people are in your family? How much land do you have? How was your life? How did you become a Kuomintang soldier? Are the Kuomintang officials good to you?" At the discussion meeting of the Seventh Squad of the First Company of a certain unit, soldier Zhang Deyuan first narrated the pain of his father, who was over sixty years old, being driven out by the landlord three times because he could not work hard, and his mother attempting suicide three times by taking poison because she had no food. Then he talked about the land reform in the liberated areas, his family being allocated land and houses, and he voluntarily joined the army. After Zhang Deyuan introduced himself, many newly liberated soldiers then expressed their grievances, telling all kinds of pains they had suffered from the oppression and exploitation of the Kuomintang army, the old regime, and the feudal landlords. After the meeting, the newly liberated soldiers unanimously believed that the suffering people can only rely on the leadership of the Communist Party and the victory of the Liberation Army to turn themselves over. The artillery company of a certain unit held small-scale grievance meetings during the time of alternating rest while building fortifications, and the veteran soldiers led from talking about family matters to their past suffering, inspiring the newly liberated soldiers to express their grievances. The characteristic of this kind of grievance expressed in the form of "introduction meetings" is that the general introduction of suffering and grievance is completed in a short period of time, and at the same time, the root cause of the pain is initially traced. The leading organs of various units then used the grievance materials of each squad as examples to carry out the education of "for whom to be a soldier, for whom to fight," and then conducted in-depth chats in each squad, which aroused the revenge emotions of the newly liberated soldiers. For example, after the Second Company of a certain regiment carried out grievance, Wang Zhizhong, a newly liberated soldier from the Fourth Squad, said, "I only thought about home when I was first liberated, but I don't want to after expressing my grievances. If everyone wants to go home, who will overthrow the Kuomintang reactionaries and avenge the poor!" After expressing their grievances, many newly liberated soldiers voluntarily told the organization their true names and positions in the Kuomintang army that they had concealed in the past.
    (4) After the newly liberated soldiers have a high fighting spirit of revenge, they should be actively helped to learn and improve their military skills in order to further consolidate their fighting spirit and confidence. For example, a certain regiment established a short-term blasting training class, and in three days, thirty-seven newly liberated soldiers learned blasting. Xiao Shijun, a newly liberated soldier from the Seventh Squad of the Third Company of a certain regiment, voluntarily requested to participate in blasting training after expressing his grievances. He said, "I didn't fight for myself in the Kuomintang, and I didn't want to learn anything. Now I am fighting for myself, so I want to quickly learn the skills of revenge, defeat the Kuomintang reactionaries, so that everyone will not suffer from it again." In military training, a certain unit also enabled some newly liberated soldiers with certain military skills to teach their skills to other comrades and carry out military mutual assistance. When the newly liberated soldiers directly participated in the war, they were also taught while fighting. For example, before each battle, the Sixth Company of a certain regiment appropriately equipped the composition of new and veteran soldiers and put forward the slogan "The battlefield is the classroom." During the defense battle of Guo Lou, the deputy platoon leader of the First Platoon explained to Chen Fugeng, a newly liberated soldier from the Third Squad, how to fight enemy tanks and use explosives. Yan Ai, a veteran soldier from the Third Platoon of the Fourth Company, explained the use of incendiary bombs to newly liberated soldiers. Many newly liberated soldiers quickly learned.
    (5) When the newly liberated soldiers gradually progress ideologically and in military skills, the company cadres encourage and commend them, and when they perform well, they also evaluate their merits. This greatly improves the enthusiasm of the newly liberated soldiers. In battle, many newly liberated soldiers strive to perform meritorious service.

　　改造新解放战士的经验
    如何从思想上、军事技术上改造与提高新解放战士，使他们迅速成为一个坚强的人民战士——这是人民解放军当前军事建设中的重大课题。华东解放军在这方面所获得的主要经验如下：
    （一）通过连队中的党员、干部、老战士，从生活上、感情上团结新解放战士。某团六连八班在副班长赵景水的模范行动影响下，全班新老同志团结无间。有一次，该班在雨天行车，赵副班长一路上帮助新解放战士曲瑞五扛枪和背背包，到了宿营地又立刻替他烤湿衣服。曲瑞五感动地说：“班长待我象亲兄弟，我以后要好好干。”当该班于连续行军后接着又筑工事时，新解放战士郭相林不愿干，倒下来就睡觉。赵副班长一声不响地拿起铁锹在月光下代替他挖。郭相林醒来一看，心里十分不安，马上夺过铁锹自己挖了。在李楼作战时，赵副班长把自己的防炮洞让给才编进班里来的新解放战士朱黄春，又把饭水送到他手里，并向他介绍了解放军的内部情形。朱黄春大受感动，坚决表示：以后也要关心和爱护新同志。该班老战士亦处处关心与照顾新解放战士。如发日用品时，老战士让新解放战士先拣。宿营遇到房子小时，老战士便自动睡在屋外。以赵景水为核心的这种团结友爱的精神，已成为该班的优良作风。
    （二）当对新解放战士初步建立了感情关系之后，就应展开个别的思想互助，提高新解放战士的政治认识。某部机枪连七班长以实例对比教育新解放战士。有一次一群民工往前方运送子弹、粮食，经过七班的驻地时，七班长就向新解放战士莫博春问道：“你过去在国民党那边看到有没有老百姓帮忙？”莫答：“国民党那边有鬼帮忙，他们走到那里，那里老百姓都跑光了。”班长接着说：“因为我们部队是为老百姓打仗的，老百姓都自愿支援前线。我们有老百姓帮助，所以到处打胜仗。”七班长在发津贴时，从解放军官兵发一样的津贴说起，向莫讲解解放军的官兵关系；在看到许多俘虏时，从解放军打胜仗说起讲解了目前形势。莫博春听后，对七班长说：“我决心跟着解放军干到底。”某团一连九班副班长隋京明在防空洞里与新解放战士谭长玉摆沙包研究战斗动作时，谭向隋说：“这怎么还用研究？官长叫怎么打就怎么打。”隋即向他解释说：“这是咱们人民军队民主的光荣传统。上级爱护咱，叫大家想办法打胜仗，而又少流血。”谭听了说：“国民党那里就完全两样。”隋便以此向谭进行了两种军队的不同作风的对比教育。不论在驻地、行军或作战中，干部与老战士积极和用空隙与新解放战士进行个别谈话，收效甚大。同时，通过新解放战士中的积极分子，对其他新解放战士进行思想互助，也曾起了一定作用。如某团八班新解放战士张成千对刚被解放的新解放战士说：“过去我们在国民党那边干，班长说一点我们干一点，这里就不同了，什么事情就要自觉自动。”新战士听他说后，以后对一切勤务都很自动地做。
    （三）新解放战士经过个别思想互助，初步提高了政治认识后，这时又对他们进行诉苦教育，使他们明确树立“为谁当兵，为谁打仗”的基本观念。由于连续作战的环境，许多单位采取了以班为单位的小型火炬诉苦会（为使新解放战士容易接受，或称“介绍会”或“恳谈会”）。在会上询问、漫谈、互相介绍经历等方法启发新解放战士诉苦。如问新战士：“你是那里人？家有多少人口、田地？生活过的怎么样？怎样当了国民党军？国民党军当官的对你好吗？”某部一连七班的恳谈会上，参军战士张德元首先叙述过去自己六十多岁的父亲因不能大力干活，被地主赶出三次、母亲因没有饭吃，三次服毒自杀未成等痛苦后，又谈到解放区进行土地改革、他家分到了土地、房子，他是自动参军的。当张德元自我介绍后，许多新解放战士接着就纷纷诉苦，说出他们过去所受国民党军队、旧政权及封建地主的压迫剥削的各种痛苦。会后，新解放战士一致认为，受苦的人只有依靠共产党的领导、依靠解放军打胜仗，才能翻身。某部炮兵连在紧张筑工事时乘轮流休息的时间举行小型诉苦会，老战士从谈家常中连续到自己的过去苦处，启发新解放战士诉苦。这种以“介绍会”等形式诉苦的特点，即是将一般引苦、诉苦在一个短促的时间内完成，同时又初步地追寻痛苦的根源。各部领导机关是时即以各班诉苦材料为实例，进行了“为谁当兵，为谁打仗”的教育，然后再在各班深入漫谈，掀起了新解放战士的复仇情绪。如某团二连进行诉苦后，四班新解放战士王志忠说：“我才解放时光想家，诉苦后不想了。如果大家都想回家，叫谁去打倒国民党反动派，为穷人报仇！”许多新解放战士诉苦后，自动向组织上说出过去隐瞒的真实姓名和在国民党军中的职务。
    （四）当新解放战士有了高涨的复仇战斗情绪后，就应积极地帮助他们学习提高军事技术，以便进一步巩固他们的战斗情绪与信心。如某团成立了短期爆破训练班，在三天中就有三十七个新解放战士学会了爆破。某团三连七班新解放战士萧世俊经过诉苦后，自动要求参加爆破学习，他说：“我在国民党那边不是为自己打仗，我什么都不想学，现在是为了自己打仗，所以我想赶快学会报仇的本领，打垮国民党反动派，好叫大家再不受它的罪。”某部在军事学习中，又使一部分在军事技术上有某些特长的新解放战士，将其技术教给其他同志，开展军事互助。当新解放战士直接参战的时候，又对他们进行边打边教。如某团六连在每次战斗前适当配备了新老战士成份，提出“战场就是课堂”的口号。某团八连在郭楼守备战中，一排副排长即向三班新解放战士陈富更讲解怎样打敌人坦克及使用炸药的办法。四连三排老战士燕埃启新解放战士讲解燃烧弹的用法。许多新解放战士很快便学会了。
    （五）当新解放战士在思想上、军事技术上逐渐进步的时候，连队干部便鼓励与表扬他们，而当他们有较好的表现时，又替他们评功。这样就大大地提高了新解放战士的积极性。在战斗中，许多新解放战士争相立功。
