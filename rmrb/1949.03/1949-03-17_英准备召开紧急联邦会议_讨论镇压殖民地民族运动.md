In addition to Eden and Listowel, according to a United Press report from London: Under-Secretary of State for Commonwealth Relations, Walker, is about to go to India, Pakistan, and Ceylon; Permanent Under-Secretary of State for Commonwealth Relations, Ritchie, is going to South Africa; and Cabinet Secretary Brooke will go to Canada.
    Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 15th: The British authorities are actively preparing to convene an emergency Commonwealth conference to discuss joint measures to suppress national revolutionary movements in British colonies. According to an Associated Press report from London: British government officials announced on the 7th that the British authorities are conducting emergency consultations with the governments of Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, Canada, India, Pakistan, and Ceylon, and may convene this conference in London before the end of March. Attlee and Bevin have successively consulted with Australian Foreign Minister Evatt. According to someone close to Australian Foreign Minister Evatt, the conference may discuss organizing a "Pacific Anti-Communist Alliance" similar to the "North Atlantic Treaty Organization." The "Times," which often reflects the official opinions of the British, recently revealed in an editorial that British imperialists and their accomplices are planning to intensify their efforts to buy off reactionaries in Southeast Asian countries in order to further divide the anti-imperialist national camps in the colonies.

　　英准备召开紧急联邦会议
  　讨论镇压殖民地民族运动
    【新华社陕北十六日电】新加坡讯：英国保守党党魁之一艾登与不列颠联邦关系部大臣李斯多威尔于十二日分别抵达新加坡。艾登系由澳洲转新加坡，并将在马来亚巡视一周。李斯多威尔则将前往澳洲与澳总理会谈。他们的出巡系与准备举行的英帝国联邦会议直接相关。这会议的召开是为了讨论联邦各国共同加强对东南亚民族革命运动的镇压。除艾登与李斯多威尔外，据合众社伦敦讯：英国联邦关系部国会次官瓦尔寇即将前往印度、巴基斯坦与锡兰；联邦关系部常任次官里钦赴南非，英内阁秘书长勃鲁克将到加拿大。
    【新华社陕北十五日电】英国当局正在积极准备召开紧急联邦会议，讨论共同镇压英属各殖民地民族革命运动措施。据美联社伦敦讯：英国政府人士于七日宣称：英国当局正在与澳大利亚、新西兰、南非、加拿大、印度、巴基斯坦与锡兰各国政府进行紧急咨商，可能于三月底以前在伦敦召开此项会议。艾德礼、贝文曾先后与澳外长伊瓦特会商。据接近澳外长伊瓦特的人承认，会议可能讨论组织一个类似“北大西洋公约”的“太平洋反共同盟”。经常反映英国官方意见的“泰晤士报”最近在一篇社论中，透露英帝国主义分子及其帮凶，正在计划加紧收买东南亚各国的反动分子，实行进一步分化各殖民地反帝民族阵营的阴谋。
