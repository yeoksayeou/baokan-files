    I. Liquidate the funds of cooperatives collected by the pseudo-Social Bureau
    II. Please the government to determine the city's rent
    III. Suggest that the Public Security and Health Bureaus pay attention to hygiene inspections
                                                  To the Editors:
    I have found three problems in this city. Please trouble yourselves to inform the relevant authorities to pay attention to handling them:
    I. Please liquidate the funds of cooperatives collected by the pseudo-Social Bureau. In February of the 37th year of the Republic (1948), the pseudo-Social Bureau announced the establishment of cooperatives in various districts and bao. At that time, hundreds of thousands of households in the city joined, each paying a share of 25,000 法币 (legal tender) (the price of which could buy a bag of white flour at the time). Various banks collected the money, forming long queues from morning to night, crowded and packed, which shows how large the amount of money collected by the cooperatives was. Unexpectedly, there was no news afterwards, and the welfare of the members was not seen at all. The use of this huge sum of money was also not announced. It is obvious that the person in charge (Bureau Chief Wen) embezzled it. It is proposed to inform the Military Control Commission to investigate and liquidate it.
    II. Please determine the city's rent. Six or seven out of ten citizens in this city live in rented houses. For several years, the currency has depreciated daily, and litigation has been delayed (a case can be delayed for two or three years), which has led to the inability to resolve rent disputes. After the liberation of this city, the interests of both parties should be taken into account, and reasonable standards should be determined as soon as possible. Otherwise, if the landlord cannot collect rent or the amount collected is not enough for repairs, then six or seven out of ten houses in this city will soon be left unattended and collapse. This is indeed a major issue for the national economy. Please forward this letter to the municipal government for verification and handling immediately.
    III. It is gratifying to read in the newspaper that a method for clearing garbage has been determined in this city. However, it is hoped that the People's Government will pay close attention to inspection and not be like the Kuomintang bureaucratic organs in the past, letting the earth diggers fill the alleys, resulting in the foundation of the houses becoming increasingly low, and rainwater pouring in, which greatly affects safety and hygiene. It is proposed to forward this letter to the Health and Public Security Bureaus, urging them to pay attention and restore the earth roads in each alley to their original height and not arbitrarily fill them higher.

　　读者建议
    一、清算伪社会局所收合作社资金
    二、请政府确定本市房租
    三、建议公安卫生两局注意卫生检查
                                                  编辑同志：
    查本市有三个问题，请费神转知有关机关注意办理：
    一、请清算伪社会局所收合作社资金。卅七年二月间，伪社会局公布各区、保组织合作社，当时市民加入者当在数十万户以上，每户均缴纳股金法币二万五千元（当时币价可以购白面一袋），由各银行代收，排成长队，自朝至暮，拥挤万分，可见合作社所收款项之多。不料事后消息杳然，社员福利丝毫未见，该项巨款究作何用，亦未见公布，显系主持人（局长温某）吞没，拟请转知军管会饬查清算。
    二、请确定本市房租。本市市民租房居住者占十分之六、七，数年以来，币价日跌，诉讼迟延（一案可拖延二、三年不等），遂致房租纠纷无法解决。本市解放后，应顾及双方利益，早日确定合理标准，否则房主不能收租或所收不够修理之费，则本市房屋十分之六、七即将无人负责修理而倒塌，此实国民经济上一个重大问题，请即转函市政府核办。
    三、报载本市垃圾已定清除办法，不胜欣慰。但希望人民政府切实注意检查，不要象过去国民党官僚机关那样，一任土夫填补各胡同，以致房基日洼，雨水倒注，安全卫生大受影响，拟请转函卫生、公安两局，务必注意，将各胡同土道恢复原来高度，不得任意填高。
