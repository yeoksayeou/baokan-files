Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, March 29th: Moscow Dispatch: An observer in the News reported on the 27th that the people's movement to support peace and oppose warmongers is expanding and strengthening daily. This has startled the instigators of a new war and shattered their plans. The frantic and rapid abandonment of the basic principles of parliamentary democracy is a characteristic of the British, Italian, French, Danish, Belgian, and Luxembourg parliaments' discussions of the North Atlantic Treaty, but they have all been unable to prevent the storm of popular protests against the aggression plan. The masses of people protesting the preparations for a new war are now protesting the North Atlantic Treaty because this treaty is the most concrete manifestation of the aggressive policy pursued by the US-British ruling clique.

Terrified by the powerful movement to defend peace, the instigators of a new war are trying to save their fate by resorting to increasingly unrestrained police violence. The United States excels in this regard. The banning of renowned French progressive leaders and representatives from Britain, as well as cultural workers from Italy, Romania, and Brazil, from attending the World Peace Conference for Science and Culture in New York is an indication of the US authorities' intention to prevent the conference from proceeding and to encourage American reactionary organizations to provoke progressive Americans who stand with progressive people worldwide against the enemies of peace.

The observer emphasized that US officials grandly welcomed Churchill—a leading warmonger. However, the protest demonstrations organized by local women upon Churchill's arrival in New York showed that this welcome did not reflect the sentiments and desires of the average American. The British people, who already distrust Churchill, are increasingly convinced that the Labour Party is continuing to implement Churchill's policies, which have been condemned by the people, and they are rising up more resolutely to oppose the policy of preparing for a new war.

The British ruling clique, substituting "guns for butter," is trying to strip the people of any possibility of protesting through action. It is precisely for this purpose that the Labour Home Secretary announced in the House of Commons on the 21st a ban on any political demonstrations in London. This has aroused great indignation among British progressives. This move by the British government shows that the British rulers have nothing in common with true democracy and that they fear the increasingly loud calls for peace from the masses of people in all countries (including Britain). But what can stop this call?

    消息报评述世界和平运动
    【新华社北平二十九日电】莫斯科讯：消息报观察家二十七日指出，拥护和平与反对战争贩子的人民运动正日益扩大与加强。这使新战争的挑拨者震惊失色，而且击破了他们的计划。疯狂地急剧地背弃议会民主的基本原则，乃是英、意、法、丹、比、卢议会讨论北大西洋公约时的特点，然而他们都不能阻止人民反对侵略计划之暴风雨般的抗议。抗议新战争准备的人民群众，现正在抗议北大西洋公约，因为这个公约是美英统治集团所奉行的侵略政策的最具体表现。为强有力的保卫和平运动所震骇的新战争挑拨者，力图以日益放肆的警察的暴力统治来挽救其命运。在这方面，美国干得最出色。禁止闻名的法国进步领袖与英国代表和意大利、罗马尼亚、巴西的文化工作者出席纽约科学与文化世界界和平大会，是美国当局意图阻止大会工作的进行，并鼓励美国反动组织向与全世界进步人类一起反对和平之敌的美国进步人民挑衅。观察家强调指出，美国官方人士盛大地欢迎邱吉尔——这一个头号战争贩子。但是，邱吉尔乘船抵达纽约时，当地妇女所组织的抗议示威，表明这种欢迎并不符合美国一般人的心情与愿望。已经不信任邱吉尔的英国人民，愈益相信工党是在继续执行为人民所谴责的邱吉尔政策，他们愈来愈坚决地起来反对准备新战争的政策。英国统治集团“枪炮代替牛油”，力图剥尽人民以行动来抗议的可能性。正是为了这个目的，工党内政部部长于二十一日在下院宣布禁止在伦敦举行任何政治示威。这激起英国进步人士的极大义愤。英国政府的这一举措，表明英国统治者与真正的民主毫无共同之处，表明他们害怕各国（包括英国在内）人民群众愈来愈响亮的拥护和平的呼声。可是，有什么东西能够阻止这个呼声。
