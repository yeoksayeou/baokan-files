Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, March 6th: According to a Telecommunications Agency report from Toronto on the 3rd: The Labor Progressive Party of Canada (i.e., the Communist Party) held a conference here and adopted a resolution on the party's basic policy. The resolution first pointed out that Wall Street's agitation for imperialist war has put world peace and Canada's national security and independence in danger. The central policy of the Labor Progressive Party of Canada is to mobilize a mass people's movement to defeat the agitation for war, especially to defeat the North Atlantic War Pact. The resolution stated that Canada's feverish prosperity is about to collapse and turn into a critical economic crisis. Canada's export industry, on which the jobs and livelihoods of millions of Canadians depend, is completely subject to American policy and American companies. Canada's ruling class has shamelessly colluded with Wall Street. In return for our country's export of raw materials to the United States, Wall Street is using the Marshall Plan to strangle our industry and agriculture. Canada's independence in foreign policy has fallen into the hands of the US State Department. The resolution guarantees that Canadian communists will fight against the running dogs of Wall Street, the Liberal Party and the Conservative Party, and Canadian monopoly capital in the next federal election. The resolution exposes the reactionary behavior of the Canadian right-wing social democrats in creating chaos, deception, and division in the labor movement. The resolution stated that on those fundamental issues of capitalism, the right-wing socialists are standing with the blatant imperialist politicians.

　　加共决定动员群众
  　击败北大西洋战争公约
    【新华社陕北六日电】据电通社多伦多三日讯：加拿大劳工进步党（即共产党）在此间举行大会，通过关于党的基本政策的决议。该决议首先指出：华尔街之鼓动帝国主义战争，已使世界和平及加拿大的国家安全与独立处于危险中；加拿大劳工进步党的中心政策，在于动员群众性的人民运动，以击败战争的鼓动，特别是要击败北大西洋战争公约。该决议称，加拿大的发热病式的繁荣行将崩溃并转为危急的经济危机。加拿大千百万人的职业及生计所系的加拿大出口业，是完全听命于美国政策和美国公司的。加拿大的统治阶级，已无耻地与华尔街结伙。为了酬报我国向美国所输出的原料，华尔街正在用马歇尔计划来绞杀我们的工业和农业。加拿大在外交政策上的独立性，已沦入美国国务院的手中。决议保证加拿大共产党人将在下届联邦大选中对华尔街的走狗自由党及保守党以及加拿大垄断资本进行斗争。决议揭发加拿大右翼社会民主党人在劳工运动中制造混乱、欺骗和分裂的反动行为。决议称，在那些对资本主义具有根本性的各项问题上，右翼社会党人是和明目张胆的帝国主义政客站在一边的。
