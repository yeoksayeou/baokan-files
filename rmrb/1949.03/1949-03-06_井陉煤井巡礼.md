A Pilgrimage to the Jingxing Coal Mine
By Our Reporter Wéi Jìn

The steam hoist (note) started, and the cage (a tool for transporting coal), suspended by the two steel cables of the steam hoist, sped down from the mouth of the steel well. I stood in the cage and suddenly everything went black. I only heard the echo of the cage descending with a loud whoosh. After a speed of more than thirty seconds, the cage descended to a depth of 184 meters underground. After taking another cage from a small well opening underground and descending more than 40 meters, we reached the bottom of the well. Here is the most famous coal-producing area of the Jingxing Coal Mine, the New Well, which once produced two to three thousand tons of coal every day.

Under the bright electric lights, one can see the arched, interconnected roadways laid with rails. Every roadway, no matter where it is opened, is tunneled through the black, oily coalfield. Even the roadway that circles the coal mine for about four or five *li* is no exception.

Working underground is dangerous. The combustion of methane gas (a toxic gas emitted by the coal seam, which burns at a rate of one thousand feet per second once ignited), the collapse of coal seams, and the influx of groundwater can take the lives of workers at any time. As Yang Changchun, the head of the underground works section, said: "Leading the work underground is like commanding soldiers in battle on the front line." Therefore, the primary task of working underground is to find ways to protect the safety of workers.

I walked from the main roadway through the small roadways toward the coal dust-filled coal cave, chatting with the workers who were mining coal, loading cars, and repairing roads along the way. They spoke with two distinctly different feelings: "During the rule of the Japanese invaders and the Chiang bandits, our safety was not guaranteed at all. The coal supervisors and foremen were very irresponsible in managing the projects. Our lives were like gambling every day we went down the well: the lucky ones worked hard all day and got some money to take back; the unlucky ones were burned to death by methane gas, crushed to death by coal seams, or suffocated to death by hot air, and were permanently buried in the dark coal pits. It was very common. In the past (referring to the period of the Japanese invaders and the Chiang bandits, same below), going down the well was as terrifying as going to hell! Now it is not like this. The superiors are indeed responsible for ensuring the safety of the workers. For example, when work starts, the section chiefs, team leaders, etc., are not like those coal supervisors or foremen in the past, who would run off after wandering around the well for a few hours. They work with the workers for eight hours, constantly running around to check the project, and immediately take preventive measures when they discover danger. The mine manager also goes down the well to check the project every two or three days. In the past, the mine manager rarely went down the well even once a month." Indeed, the work of protecting the safety of workers is now obviously different from the past. As roadways for transportation, sturdy canopies have been built (that is, using wooden pillars to build a frame to support the coal seam above), unlike the remaining roadways from the past, where the canopies were very sparse. A small wooden pillar was used to build a canopy only at a distance of one meter, and the heavy coal blocks could easily break the wooden pillars of the canopy, and many roadways collapsed in this way. Transportation workers did not know how many dangers they encountered in these places. Now, the restored roadways have three canopies built at a distance of one meter, and the wooden pillars are thick and strong. Even so, the management personnel still check frequently, and if they find that one of the wooden pillars is damaged, they immediately replace it. Therefore, the workers call the current roadways "insurance roads." When digging coal caves near places where methane combustion has been discovered, experienced leading comrades first risk drilling holes to probe. If fire and smoke are found to emerge, they are immediately blocked, proving that there is methane inside, and workers are never allowed to dig holes here. Sometimes, methane combustion is also encountered during coal mining, and the foul-smelling fire and smoke often make people cough, vomit, or faint on the ground. However, for the safety of the vast number of workers, the section chiefs, team leaders, etc., always show a fearless spirit and step forward one after another to block the fire and smoke with mud.

The leading comrades of the mine attach great importance to the ventilation work, which is vital to the life and death of all underground employees. In these places, section chiefs, team leaders, etc., often check the degree of air circulation. If the air circulation is slightly insufficient, they immediately find ways to repair the ventilation ducts or open new ventilation ducts. Therefore, there is no stuffy, hot phenomenon that makes people unable to breathe in the coal caves, and there is often a cool air circulating in the roadways. This good phenomenon did not exist in the past. As the workers said: "At that time, who cared whether the air was circulating or not?! Anyway, it was the workers who suffered. In the entire coal mine, it was often so hot that people could not breathe, and everyone's sweaty smell and the smell of feces and urine were simply disgusting and nauseating. Wasn't it common to get sick? This is not the main thing. If the air is not circulating, the methane gas will be more likely to burn, which is terrible." Indeed, if the air does not circulate, the methane gas in the coal seam will combine with hot air and coal dust and burn. In 1943, when the Japanese ruled, a coal cave was not well ventilated, and suddenly the methane gas burned violently, killing five or six hundred people in a few seconds!

Another guarantee for the safety of workers is that, under the education of the factory, everyone has general knowledge of preventing danger. The workers automatically set rules and supervise each other.

Workers are no longer as afraid of diseases as they used to be. In the past, when workers were sick, the management personnel would not allow them to take leave. Even if they were lying in the coal cave or roadway moaning and groaning, the management personnel would not care. The spread of diseases and the increase in the number of patients meant that the moans of patients could be heard everywhere. Now, if anyone feels unwell or injures their hands or feet, the section chief immediately approves leave to go up the well for free diagnosis and treatment; if it is a minor illness, they take a few days of rest; if it is serious, they stay in the hospital.

Now, the workers do not feel as terrified as if they were "going to hell" when they go down the well to work. They are at ease and happy. Dominated by this mood, they work with a high degree of labor enthusiasm. Half an hour before starting work, they prepare for work such as wiping the lampshades and filling the lamp oil. They are unwilling to put these tasks in the official working hours. During working hours, I did not see a worker being lazy for a moment. Even the most hardworking coal miners, when they were resting, would help the coal loaders next to them who were too busy, regardless of their fatigue. Their intense work is because they never forget a glorious goal: to strive to improve production efficiency! Now, the average efficiency of coal production per person per day underground is 0.786 tons, which is a great improvement compared to the average efficiency of coal production per person per day in the past (during the Chiang bandit period) of 0.45 tons!

(Note) Steam hoist: a machine erected at the mouth of the well, driven by a steam engine to drive the wheels to hoist coal from the bottom of the well.

　　井陉煤井巡礼
    本报记者  维进
    汽高车（注）开动了，被汽高车的两条钢丝绳吊着的罐笼（运煤的工具）离钢井口飞速而下。我站在罐笼里忽然一阵黑漆，只听得罐笼降落的回音哗啦地响着，经三十余秒钟的速度，罐笼降落到一百八十四米深的井下。从井下另一个小井口再乘一次罐笼，降落四十余米深后，便到达井底。这里，就是井陉煤矿最著名的产煤区、曾经每天产煤二、三千吨的新井。
    在明亮的电灯下，可以看见弓形的铺着铁轨的四通八达的巷道。每一条巷道不管从那里开辟，都是从黑油油的煤田穿凿过去的，即使绕煤井一周的长约四五里的巷道也不能例外。
    井下的工作是带着危险性的，沼气的燃烧（煤层发出的一种有毒气体，只要一着火，一秒钟燃烧一千尺），煤层的倒塌，地下水的涌出，随时可以夺去工人的生命。正如井工股长杨长春说的：“领导井下的工作，好象在前线指挥士兵作战。”因此井下工作的首要任务就是设法保护工人的安全。
    我从大巷道穿过小巷道向煤尘飞舞的煤洞走去，沿途和刨煤的，装车的，修道的工人攀谈：他们带着两种显著不同的感觉说：“在日寇、蒋匪统治的时候，咱们的安全是毫无保障的。煤师，监工等对于工程的管理很不负责任。咱们每天下井工作，性命好象赌博一样：幸运的，辛苦一天，拿到几个钱回去；不幸运的，给沼气烧死，煤层压死，热气闷死，永远埋在黑洞洞的煤坑里，是很普通的事情。过去（指日寇、蒋匪时期，下同）下井工作就好象进地狱一样使人可怕呀！现在不是这个样子了，上级确实负责保障工人的安全。比方说，上工的时候，股长、班长等都不象从前那些煤师或监工，在井里转上几个钟头就跑掉了，他们和工人一直工作八个钟头，两条腿不停的跑到各处检查工程，发现危险，随即设法预防。矿长也是三两天下井一次检查工程的，从前的矿长一个月也难得下井一次。”的确，现在保护工人安全的工作较之过去显然不同了，作为交通运输的巷道，都搭起了坚固的棚子（即以木柱搭起架子顶住上面的煤层），绝不象过去所残存的巷道那样，那些棚子非常稀松，要一米达的距离才用细小的木柱搭一个棚子，沉重的煤块很容易就把棚子的木柱压断，许多巷道就这样倒塌下来了。运输工人在这些地方不知碰过多少危险。现在修复起来的巷道，一米达的距离就搭起三个棚子，木柱是粗大结实的，即使这样，管理人员还经常检查，如发现有一根木柱损坏，随即更换，因此工人都把现在的巷道叫作“保险道”。当在曾经发现过沼气燃烧的地方附近打煤洞时，有经验的领导同志，便首先冒险凿眼试探，如发现冒出火烟即加堵塞，即证明里头有沼气，决不让工人在这里打洞子。在刨煤当中，有时也会碰见沼气燃烧的，恶臭难闻的火烟味气，时常把人熏得咳嗽作呕或晕倒于地，但是股长、班长等为了广大工人的安全，每次都拿出大无畏的精神前仆后继的用泥土把火烟堵住了。
    矿厂的领导同志对于井下全体职工生死攸关的通风工作非常重视。在这些地方，股长班长等经常检查风气流通的程度，如果风气稍为不足，随即设法修理风道或另开风道。因此在煤洞里没有闷热得使人喘不过气来的现象，在巷道里经常有一股清凉的空气在流通。这种良好的现象在过去是没有的，正如工人们说的：“那时候，风气通不通谁关心呢？！反正受罪的是咱们工人。在整个煤井里，时常热得使人喘不过气来，大家的汗臭味和大小便的臭味简直使人恶心欲呕，病倒还不是经常的事情？这还不要紧，空气不通，沼气也会更易燃烧，才可怕哩。”的确，风气不流通，煤层中的沼气就要结合热空气和煤尘燃烧起来的。民国三十二年日本统治时，有一片煤洞没有很好通风，忽然沼气猛烈燃烧起来了，几秒钟就烧死了五六百人！
    工人的安全得到另一种保障的，就是在厂方教育下，每个人都具备着预防危险的一般知识。工人自动定出纪律，互相监督。
    工人对于疾病再不象过去那样可怕了，过去工人有病，管理人员不准请假的，躺在煤洞或巷道呻吟打滚，管理人员也不理的。疾病的传染，病人的增加，随处都可以听见病人的呻吟。现在谁要身体不大舒服或碰伤手足，股长随即准假上井免费诊治；轻则休养几天，重则住在医院。
    现在工人对于下井工作，完全不象过去如“进地狱”那样恐怖了，他们是安然的愉快的。在这种心情支配下，他们以高度的劳动热忱进行工作。当距上工还有半点钟时，他们就作好擦灯罩、灌灯油等准备工作，他们不愿意把这些工作放在正式工作时间里。在工作时间里，我没有看见一个工人有片刻偷懒的，即使最辛苦的刨煤工人，当他休息时，看见旁边装煤的忙不过来，便不顾疲倦帮他干起来了。他们这样紧张的工作，乃是时刻不忘为着一个光荣的目标：为提高生产效率而奋斗！现在井下产煤每人每天平均效率零点七八六吨，较之过去（蒋匪时期）产煤每人每天平均效率零点四五吨已经大大提高了！
    （注）汽高车，是耸立井口用蒸气机推动车轮以从井底吊煤的机器。
