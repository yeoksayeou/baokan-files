[Jiluyu Telegram] In active preparation for this year's great production movement, the Jiluyu Administrative Office Farm, in mid-last month, convened 19 farmers from nearby villages such as Huanggangji with rich production experience to exchange experiences in weeding wheat, planting cotton, and planting "811 millet."

First, talking about weeding wheat, Han Dafan from Huanggangji said, "I weed my wheat every year, and each mu can increase the yield by two sheng, and the weight of each dou increases by two or three jin, and there is more flour produced. Weeding wheat depends on the solar terms; you can start hoeing when the wheat grows to three or four fingers high." Chen Yukun from the farm said, "Wheat that has been weeded has fuller grains and a higher yield, but don't weed it too late. Wait until it has grown a bit longer before weeding, as it is easy to damage the roots." Everyone agreed that weeding wheat has a hundred benefits and no drawbacks.

Regarding cotton planting, Zhang Changcun from the farm said, "I plant cotton every year, and I put in a lot of effort, and I also get a lot of harvest. Last year, the foreign cotton (American cotton) I planted yielded 70 jin of cotton per mu, and each jin can be exchanged for 8 jin of rice. Each mu can be exchanged for 560 jin of rice, and one mu of cotton is worth the income of three mu of grain." His planting method is: "Thin planting for more bolls, dense planting for more picking." The rows should be 2.1 chi wide, and the plants should be 1.8 chi apart. Thin planting results in more bolls, but they will not open after the frost. Dense planting results in fewer bolls, and they may all fall off at the time of frost, so there is more picking. Liu Yiyi from Huanggangji said, "Planting foreign cotton not only yields more cotton, but the cottonseed is also good. Every 81 jin can produce one batch of oil, with each batch yielding 11 jin of oil, while local cotton only yields 9 jin. The oil pressed from foreign cotton seeds also tastes better than local cotton, and can be used as food next year."

Regarding planting "811 millet": Since 1939, trials have been conducted in Shenyang, Fanxian, Qingfeng, Lincheng, and other places, and the results have all shown that the yield per mu is on average one-third higher than local millet. This proves that "811 millet" can be promoted for cultivation.

As for general farming methods, Han Dafan's experience is the richest. He said, "To grow crops well, to ensure the soil is neither too dry nor too wet, and that the seedlings grow well, you must plow hard soil, harrow dry soil, sow in yellow soil, hoe loose soil, and add manure. To ensure the crops take root, you must spring sow (deep plowing), summer mud (shallow hoeing), and autumn smooth (even shallower hoeing)." Regarding selecting land and selecting seeds, he also said, "Sparse land requires cleverness, fertile land requires diligence, and you will harvest granaries full of grain." This means that sparse land has little power, so choose early-maturing crops, while fertile land has power, so choose late-maturing crops, and naturally you can harvest more grain.

After this meeting, after exchanging experiences, everyone has more confidence and assurance in increasing the yield of cotton and grain. In the future, such symposiums will continue to be held widely.

　　锄麦百利无一害
    一亩棉顶三亩田
    冀鲁豫农场请老农谈经验
    【冀鲁豫电】积极准备今年大生产运动，冀鲁豫行署农场，于上月中旬召集附近黄岗集等村富有生产经验的农民十九人，交流锄麦、种棉、种“八一一谷”的经验。先谈锄麦，黄岗集韩大凡说：“我的麦子年年锄，每亩可增收二升，每斗重量增加二、三斤，出面又多。锄麦子看节气，麦长到三、四指高就可动锄。”农庄陈玉坤说：“锄了的麦子，粒又饱又多收，但不要锄得晚，要扎长长后再锄，容易伤根。”大家都认为麦子锄后，有百利而无一害。关于种棉，农庄张长存说：“我年年种棉，功夫下得大，收得也多。去年种的洋棉（美棉）每亩收花七十斤，每斤折米八斤，每亩可折米五百六十斤，一亩棉可顶三亩谷的收入”。他的种法是：“稀看疙瘩稠拾花”，行要二尺一寸宽，棵一尺八寸远。稀了结的桃多，霜降就开不了，稠了结的桃少，霜降时可掉光，所以拾花多。黄岗集刘一一说：“种洋棉不光多拾花，棉子也好，每八十一斤可打一槽油，每槽出油十一斤，柴花只出九斤；洋花籽榨的油又比柴花好吃，明年可当粮食吃。”关于种“八一一谷”：自民国二十八年起，在沈阳、范县、清丰、临城等地试种，结果都比当地谷子每亩产量平均多收三分之一。证明“八一一谷”可以推广耕种。至于一般种地的方法，韩大凡的经验最丰富。他说：“要把地种好，要使地不干、不湿，苗长得好，必须犁硬土、耙干土、耩黄土、锄浮土、加粪土。要庄稼扎根，必须春播（即深耕）、夏泥（即浅锄）、秋打滑（更浅锄）”。对于选地、选种，他又说：“薄种巧，肥种笨，收得粮食满满囤”。是说薄地无力，选种早熟庄稼，壮地有力，选种晚熟庄稼，粮食自然可以多收。经这次会议，交流了经验以后，大家对提高棉粮的产量都有了信心和把握。今后此种座谈会还将继续广泛地举行。
