Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 22nd. Li Zongren, the puppet acting president of the Nanjing Kuomintang government, appointed the members of He Yingqin's puppet cabinet on the 21st, with Jia Jingde as the puppet vice president of the Executive Yuan, Zhang Qun, Mo Dehui, Zhang Zhizhong, Zhu Jiahua, and He Yaozu as puppet political affairs committee members, Li Hanhun as the puppet Minister of the Interior, Fu Bingchang as the puppet Minister of Foreign Affairs, Xu Shuichang as the puppet Minister of National Defense, Liu Gongyun as the puppet Minister of Finance, Hang Liwu as the puppet Minister of Education, Zhang Zhiben as the puppet Minister of Justice, Sun Yueqi as the puppet Minister of Economic Affairs, Duanmu Jie as the puppet Minister of Communications, Bai Yunti as the puppet Chairman of the Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission, Dai Kuisheng as the puppet Chairman of the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission, Pang Songzhou as the puppet Director-General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics of the Executive Yuan, and Huang Shaoju as the puppet Secretary-General of the Executive Yuan. It is reported that He Yingqin once declared at a reception of the Nanjing puppet Supervisory Yuan on the 18th: "To relieve the people's suffering, peace is the only way. Therefore, my cabinet formation this time can be called a peace cabinet." However, whether He Yingqin's judgment conforms to the facts cannot be verified from his "cabinet" list, nor can it be verified from his declaration. Since January 1st of this year, Chiang Kai-shek, Sun Ke, Zhang Qun, Zhu Jiahua, Li Zongren, Bai Chongxi, and He Yingqin, no one has not claimed to be an enthusiast for peace, but so far no one has been able to prove their declaration with action. The fact that the Chinese people know is that American imperialism is continuing to aid and instigate all Kuomintang reactionaries, and all Kuomintang reactionaries, especially the bandit leader Chiang Kai-shek and his diehards, are continuing to oppress the people and continue to organize wars. Will Li Zongren and his He Yingqin cabinet truly accept and implement the eight peace conditions of the Chinese Communist Party, implement the peace that the people need, and thereby give themselves the opportunity to repent and atone for their crimes? Or will they use the name of so-called "reasonable, fair, and comprehensive peace" to preserve the counter-revolutionary forces and cover up their continued war? The time to prove this is now approaching, and it will be clear once peace negotiations are held. The people of the whole country are watching the upcoming peace negotiations, and they want to see what role the Nanjing Kuomintang reactionary government will play in this negotiation.

　　南京伪内阁名单公布
    【新华社陕北二十二日电】南京国民党政府伪代总统李宗仁二十一日任命了何应钦伪内阁的阁员，以贾景德为伪行政院副院长，张群、莫德惠、张治中、朱家骅、贺耀祖为伪政务委员，李汉魂为伪内政部长，傅秉常为伪外交部长，徐水昌为伪国防部长，刘攻芸为伪财政部长，杭立武为伪教育部长，张知本为伪司法部长，孙越崎为伪经济部长，端木杰为伪交通部长，白云梯为伪蒙藏委员会委员长，戴愧生为伪侨务委员会委员长，庞松舟为伪行政院主计长，黄少谷为伪行政院秘书长。按何应钦在十八日南京伪监察院招待会上曾宣称：“欲解除人民痛苦，唯有和平一途。故本人此次组阁，可谓和平组阁。”但是何应钦断语是否符合事实，既不能从他的“内阁”名单来证实，也不能从他的宣言来证实。从今年一月一日起，蒋介石、孙科、张群、朱家骅、李宗仁、白崇禧到何应钦，没有一个人不自称为和平的热心家，但是至今还没有一个人能用行动来证明自己的宣言。中国人民所知道的事实是美国帝国主义在继续援助和策动一切国民党反动派，而一切国民党反动派，尤是匪首蒋介石及其死党，无一不在继续压迫人民和继续组织战争。李宗仁及其何应钦内阁，今后究竟是确实的接受并执行中国共产党的八项和平条件，实行人民所需要的和平，并借此使他们自己获得悔过自新、将功折罪的机会呢？还是假借所谓“合理的、公平的、全面的和平”的名义，求得保存反革命势力，并掩护其继续战争呢？证明这一点的时机，现已日益迫近，只待举行和平谈判就可以见分晓。全国人民正在注视即将举行的和平谈判，他们要看一看南京国民党反动政府在这个谈判中扮演什么样角色。
