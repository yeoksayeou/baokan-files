[Jizhong Dispatch] Xinji City held a mass rally on the 13th of this month to expose the crimes of bandits and special agents using the "Yiguandao" organization to collude with the enemy, spread rumors, and carry out sabotage. The democratic government sentenced the principal culprit, Yang Zesheng, to imprisonment. At 12:00 noon that day, Comrade Wen Gang, Director of the Municipal Industry and Commerce Bureau, representing the government, announced the significance of the meeting. Liu Zhifang (a landlord's wife) of "Yiguandao" reported the deceptive tricks used to deceive the people. She said, "In order to deceive the people and sabotage the liberated areas, we pretended to be gods and ghosts to confuse people. This was all fake; we conspired in advance to fabricate it." The principal culprit, Yang Zesheng, confessed to his heinous crimes of colluding with the enemy to carry out sabotage, stating, "After the liberation of Xinji in 1945, I was arrested for spreading rumors and carrying out sabotage. After being educated and released, I fled to Shijiazhuang and accepted secret missions from Zhao Xuewu and Feng Zhenji of the Kuomintang. After returning, I immediately began collecting intelligence on the People's Liberation Army's troops, as well as the addresses and numbers of personnel of government organs, and supplied them to Yu Zhishui, the enemy garrison commander in Shijiazhuang, and the Xintai Shoe Store (special agent organ) in Beiping. Furthermore, during several land reforms and army recruitment campaigns, I systematically carried out a series of rumors, incitements, and intimidation of the masses." Director Yang of the Municipal Public Security Bureau exposed the crimes in the "Yiguandao" documents he had seized. In order to stabilize social order, he filed a public prosecution with the democratic government in his capacity as prosecutor. The government immediately sentenced the principal culprit, Yang Zesheng, to two and a half years of imprisonment based on the crimes of the accused. Liu Zhifang, Zhang Xiaoduo, Wu Chou, and Liu Xiaomian (all women) were released on bail on the spot after confessing to the masses, as they were young and ignorant and had been deceived and misled. Finally, the government announced that all feudal and backward religious sects are illegal and must immediately cease their activities. It also called on all those involved in the sect to confess and register with the government, repent, and make a fresh start. Those who insist on carrying out sabotage will be severely punished according to the law.
