Beining Railway Fengtai Locomotive Depot
    Promotes Crew Responsibility System, Greatly Improving Work Efficiency
    [This Newspaper Reported] The Fengtai Locomotive Depot has implemented a crew responsibility system, leading to an unprecedented increase in work efficiency. On March 17th, the depot began to change from the past shift system. Twenty-eight locomotives are now under the crew responsibility system. In order to be responsible for the safekeeping, driving, and cleaning of the locomotives from the beginning and gradually fulfill the responsibility of simple repairs, the following requirements are set based on the existing conditions of the crew members: those with more than five years of experience will learn "Grade C Inspection" within six months; those with two to five years of experience will learn it within one year; and those with less than two years of experience will learn it within one and a half years. Each locomotive is assigned nine people (three drivers, six assistant stokers), divided into three groups, taking turns driving, resting, and studying. Since then, the workers have shown great care for their locomotives. Especially since the 24th, workers have demonstrated collective creativity, repairing locomotive ㄇㄎ·一·七七二 as a model for Fengtai locomotives, emblazoned with the words "Advancing Happily Under the Banner of Chairman Mao." Workers, day and night, whenever they have a small break, even during a few minutes of stopping at a small station, are busy scraping the rust that has accumulated on the locomotive for many years and wiping off the congealed grease. Due to a shortage of materials, lacking black cotton wicks, they buy linen thread with their own money, or use their own worn-out clothes. Some locomotive motors were damaged, so they offered the wires they had hidden during the enemy puppet period to install lights. In order to keep the locomotive tender clean, they bought brooms with their own money; and actively learned from the craftsmen to treat the locomotives, sometimes borrowing a brick from the square to replace sandpaper for learning. Stoker Song Quanfu, who used to be a notorious "time-waster," is now also proactive. Under the everyone's earnest implementation of the plan to thoroughly clean the locomotives, the locomotive condition is getting better day by day. As of now, all locomotives going out are bright and clean, with "steel" and "copper" clearly distinguishable (meaning clean). As driver Wang Yaolong of locomotive ㄇㄎ八三八 said: "In the past, we were so-so, but now the workers have become the masters of the new enterprise, and the locomotive is their closest partner, who would be willing to work without enthusiasm!"

　　北宁路丰台机务段
    推行乘务负责制工作效率大提高
    【本报讯】丰台机务段，实行乘务负责制，工作效率空前提高。该段于三月十七日开始改变过去的轮班制，二十八台机车实行乘务负责制；为了对机车从开始负责保管、驾驶、清扫并逐渐尽到简单修理的责任，根据现有乘务员的条件，规定五年以上者，半年学会“丙检”；五年以下二年以上者，一年内学会；二年以下者，一年半学会。固定每辆机车九人（司机三，正副司炉六），分为三组，轮流驾驶、休息和学习。从此，工人对自己的机车，表现非常爱护。特别是从二十四日，发挥工人集体创造，修理ㄇㄎ·一·七七二号机车为丰台机车的榜样，上面装制着“在毛主席旗帜下愉快前进”的字。工人们白天夜里只要有个小空，甚至在小站停车几分钟，都忙着刮机车上多年的生锈和揩擦凝结的油垢，因材料缺，没有黑绵丝，便自己拿钱买线麻，或用自己的破单衣，有些机车电机破损了，他们便献出在敌伪时代隐蔽的电线装制电灯，为了保持机车篓的清洁，自己拿钱买条帚；并积极向工匠学习给机车治病，有时借广场找块砖头代替砂纸来进行学习。学习司炉宋全福过去是有名的“磨洋工”，现在也积极了。在大家认真执行彻底清扫机车的计划下，机车状态日趋良好，至此，凡包乘出去的机车，没有不带亮的，没有不是“钢”，“铜”分明的（即干净）。正如ㄇㄎ八三八号机车司机王耀隆所说：“过去是马马虎虎，现在工人成了新企业的主人，机车是自己最亲密的伙伴，谁肯干着不积极！”
