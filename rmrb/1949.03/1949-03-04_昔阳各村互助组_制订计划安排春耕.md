　　Mutual Aid Teams in Xiyang County
  　Make Plans for Spring Plowing
    [Taihang News] After the land reform in Beisixian Village, Xiyang County, the masses' enthusiasm for production has greatly increased. The Chen Siyou mutual aid team in the village carried out rectification during the gap in the first month of the lunar calendar, reviewed past achievements and shortcomings, and formulated this year's production plan. The team was established in 1945. Thanks to Chen Siyou's democratic leadership and fair and reasonable equal value setting and the use of labor according to the strength and skills of the workers, it has become increasingly consolidated. Daily work is discussed by everyone: what is urgent and what to do first, how many people are needed, what kind of people are needed, so as to avoid waste of labor. For example, the 66-year-old Yin Zhongsheng can only top five points for other work, but if he cultivates the land, he can top a full labor force (ten points). In this way, he can cultivate the land well and earn more points, which is beneficial to both parties, so everyone is satisfied. Old man Zhongsheng said: "If I hadn't been organized, I would have suffered." Then he asked: How should we work this year? Chen Siyou first told everyone about his plan, which he had already made: "The whole family of five people cultivates a total of nineteen mu of land. The plan is to plant seven mu of corn, strive to cultivate three times (including autumn plowing), apply 25 loads of fertilizer per mu (five loads more per mu than last year, the same for rice fields), and ensure three hoeings. Plant eight mu of millet, cultivate twice, apply 25 loads of fertilizer per mu, and ensure two hoeings. Plant two and a half mu of Chinese yams, melons and vegetables, and build the four-way intersection, five feet high and one zhang long, this spring. In this way, if we have a normal year, each mu can harvest one big stone, a total of nineteen stones, with a surplus after eating. In terms of sideline production: the 13-year-old girl spins ten catties of cotton throughout the year, which can supply the whole family's clothing. Raising six chickens, the money from selling the eggs is enough to buy flowers. And plant six fruit trees." After this plan was made, the whole team launched a discussion. Everyone said it was well made! At this time, everyone was making their own plans, and finally, based on the plans of each household, a plan for the whole team was made, and the current work was arranged. In addition to continuing to accumulate fertilizer, firewood should be enough for the whole year in the first month of the lunar calendar, and in the second month, we will carry out work such as sending manure, applying it to the fields, building soil, adding canals, and widening them. Women mainly carry out spinning and weaving. Activities have now begun.
    Also reported: The Guo Youjun mutual aid team in Bazhou, District 1, grew up in 1945 under the principle of voluntariness. The whole team has thirteen households, ten people, one hundred and twenty mu of land, seventeen full and half labor forces, three donkeys, and two oxen. The characteristic of the team is that it is combined with families, relatives, friends, and those who are compatible. The main work every day is exchanging labor. After the lunar New Year, the Guo Youjun mutual aid team began to actively carry out production and spring plowing preparations. First, they calculated the total assets of the team, which were still short of sixteen shi and six dou of grain. The production last winter solved part of it, and the rest can be solved by combining spring plowing preparations with transportation, handicrafts, commerce and other productions. The team currently has 1,173 loads of fertilizer, an average of ten loads per mu. The plan is to reach thirteen loads per mu by using methods such as picking up fertilizer and fumigating the soil. Most of the coal burned is enough for the whole year, and the least is enough for half a year. There is no difficulty in agricultural tools and animal power, only a few pieces can be repaired. In the second month of the lunar calendar, the plan is: labor to build soil, livestock to send manure, in preparation for spring plowing. (Xiyang County Small Newspaper)

　　昔阳各村互助组
  　制订计划安排春耕
    【太行讯】昔阳县北思贤村结束土地改革后，群众生产情绪大为提高。该村陈四有互助组，在旧历正月的空隙中进行了整顿，检查了过去的成绩与缺点，并订出今年的生产计划。该组是在一九四五年成立的，由于陈四有的民主领导与公道合理的等价订分及按劳力强弱技术不同的劳力使用，因此越来越巩固，每天的营生要经大家商量：什么当紧先做啥，需要多少人，需要什么人，这样就避免了劳力的浪费。如六十六岁的尹中生老汉，做其他活只能顶五分，如果耕地即能顶个全劳力用（十分），这样，既能耕好地，又能多顶分，双方都有利，所以大家都满意。中生老汉说：“要不是组织起来我可受了罪啦。”接着又提出：今年怎样干？陈四有把他早已订好的计划，首先告给大家说：“全家五口人，共种地十九亩。计划种玉茭七亩，争取耕三遍（秋耕在内），每亩上肥二十五驮（每亩比去年多上五驮，谷田同），保证锄三遍，种谷八亩，耕两次，每亩上肥二十五驮，保证锄两遍，种山药瓜菜二亩半，并要把五尺高一丈长的四道岔，今春一定要垒起。这样，如给个平常年景，每亩也能收一大石，共收十九石，除吃还有余。副业方面：十三岁的小女孩全年纺花十斤，即可供给全家人的穿衣。养鸡六只，下蛋卖的钱足够买花之用。并植果木树六棵，”这一计划订出后，全组开展了讨论。大家都说订的好！这时各自都在订定自己的计划，最后根据各户计划，又订出了全组计划，并安排了目前的营生，除继续积肥外，正月打柴要够全年烧，二月进行送粪、上地、垒土、加渠、展宽等营生，妇女们主要开展纺织。现在已经开始活动。
    又讯：一区巴洲郭有俊互助组，是在一九四五年在自愿原则下生长起来的。全组十三户，人口十口，地一百二十亩，男女全半劳力十七个，驴三头，牛两个。该组特点是以家族、亲友、相好、对眼结合的，每天营生主要是变工。旧历年后郭有俊互助组，便开始积极进行生产和春耕准备工作。首先算了全组家当，尚差粮十六石六斗，去冬生产即解决了一部，其余结合春耕准备进行运输、手工业、商业等生产亦能得到解决。全组现有肥料一千一百七十三驮，每亩即平均十驮，计划用拾肥、熏土等办法要达到每亩十三驮。烧煤大部够全年用，最少的亦够半年烧。农具畜力都不困难，仅有几件可以修理，在旧历二月计划：劳力垒土，牲口送粪，准备春耕。　　　（昔阳县小报）
