Xinhua News Agency, Beiping, 27th: Mr. Shen Junru, Standing Committee Member of the Central Committee of the China Democratic League, delivered a speech at the welcome meeting in Beiping on the 26th: Chairman, distinguished guests, on behalf of the China Democratic League, I feel extremely honored and excited that the Headquarters of the People's Liberation Army's Pingjin Front, the Beiping Military Control Commission, the Beiping Municipal People's Government, and the Beiping Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China are holding such a grand welcome meeting to welcome us today. I would like to extend my warmest respects to the leaders of the four party, government, and military organs, as well as all the working comrades present.

As everyone knows, Beiping has been the capital of autocratic emperors for thousands of years. After the autocratic emperors fell, it became the capital of reactionary rule under the Northern Warlords such as Yuan Shikai, Wu Peifu, Duan Qirui, and Zhang Zuolin. After the Northern Warlords fell, a Kuomintang fascist tyrant, Chiang Kai-shek, who was "later in coming" and whose reactionary brutality surpassed all past autocratic emperors, imposed a bloody rule. Thus, Beiping has always been a fortress of darkness and autocracy, a symbol of the prison of 400 million people.

However, thanks to the arduous and outstanding struggle and correct and firm leadership of the Communist Party of China, the savior of the people, and more importantly, thanks to the invincible power of the great revolutionary People's Liberation Army, a bright day has finally arrived. This is the great festival of January 31, 1949, when the former capital, Beiping, was transferred to the hands of the people.

The liberation of Beiping symbolizes the destruction of the entire autocratic fortress in China and heralds the complete elimination of the Kuomintang's reactionary rule of betraying the country and harming the people.

Here, we must recognize two points: First, Beiping was achieved through peaceful negotiations, not by force like Tianjin. However, if it were not for the close encirclement of hundreds of thousands of People's Liberation Army soldiers under the command of Generals Lin Biao and Nie Rongzhen, if it were not for the living example of the liberation of Tianjin, and if the reactionaries felt there was still room for struggle, it would be unimaginable to achieve liberation through negotiations. We should recognize that the main reason why liberation could be achieved through negotiations is the power of the people's revolution, especially the revolutionary power of the People's Liberation Army.

The second significance of the peaceful liberation of Beiping is that although the liberation of Beiping was achieved through peaceful negotiations, and the administrative organs were taken over peacefully, and the original system should be maintained as much as possible for the time being, this absolutely does not mean that the liberation of Beiping has a reformist or compromising meaning. Absolutely not, the liberation of Beiping must be an uncompromising revolutionary liberation. Such a revolution through negotiations can only be realized by strictly adhering to the Eight Peace Proposals of the people's leader, Mr. Mao Zedong. The China Democratic League has always advocated that true and thorough peace must be democratic peace, and it must be revolutionary peace. Therefore, we resolutely, sincerely, and enthusiastically support Mr. Mao Zedong's Eight Peace Proposals. All peace talks can only achieve the true peace that the people of the whole country demand—thorough, democratic, and revolutionary peace—if these Eight Peace Proposals are used as the minimum prerequisite.

But Chiang Kai-shek and Li Zongren are also talking about peace, saying it is to "save the people from fire and water." We have long seen through their tricks and pointed out that they are playing the conspiracy of fake peace. The facts of the past month or so have fully proved that our judgment is not wrong. The history of the past three years has fully proved that the likes of Chiang Kai-shek and Li Zongren are experts in creating fire and water for the people. They are the culprits who destroyed peace, launched the civil war, and sold out the motherland three years ago. In the past month or so, Li Zongren has been singing a peace opera on the stage, while Chiang Kai-shek has been actively deploying a counter-revolutionary military force to resist the People's Liberation Army behind the scenes. Sun Ke shamelessly invited international imperialists to interfere in China's internal affairs, and American imperialism is still actively supporting Chiang Kai-shek and Li Zongren either overtly or covertly. Under such circumstances, we should thoroughly smash the Kuomintang reactionaries' conspiracy of fake peace!

But especially important is that we must never forget the other conspiracy of US imperialism, that is, in addition to actively supporting all the remaining counter-revolutionary forces, it is also desperately infiltrating the revolutionary camp to deploy various conspiracies and tricks. Especially important is that US imperialism is relentlessly looking for opportunities to create an "opposition party" or "opposition faction" to undermine the victory of the Chinese people. We, the democratic parties and democrats, must unite to resolutely and thoroughly smash this kind of conspiracy!

Finally, I want to shout:
Resolutely support Chairman Mao's Eight Peace Proposals!
Thoroughly smash the counter-revolutionary fake peace conspiracy!
Long live the liberation of the Chinese people!

　　沈钧儒先生的演词
    呼吁民主人士和党派团结起来
    粉碎美帝制造“反对派”的阴谋
    【新华社北平二十七日电】中国民主同盟中央常务委员沈钧儒在二十六日北平欢迎会上的演词：主席，各位先生：钧儒代表中国民主同盟，对于今天中国人民解放军平津前线司令部北平军事管制委员会、北平市人民政府和中国共产党北平市委员会举行这样一个盛大的欢迎会来欢迎我们，感觉到万分的荣幸和兴奋。钧儒特先向四个党政军机关的领导者及全体与会的工作同志们致热烈的敬礼。
    大家知道，北平是一个千百年来专制帝王建都的所在；专制帝王倒了之后，变成了袁世凯、吴佩孚、段琪瑞、张作霖等北洋军阀反动统治的首都；北洋军阀倒了以后，却来了一个“后来居上”，反动残暴压倒过去一切专制帝王的国民党法西斯暴君蒋介石的血腥统治。这样，北平一直是一个黑暗专制的堡垒，是一个四万万人民牢狱的象征。
    然而，由于中国共产党这个人民的救星，实行了艰苦卓绝的奋斗，正确坚定的领导，更由于伟大的革命的人民解放军具有所向无敌的强大威力，一个光明的日子，终于到来了。这就是一九四九年一月三十一日故都北平转到人民手里来的伟大节日。
    北平的解放，象征着全中国专制堡垒的被摧毁，预示着卖国殃民的国民党反动统治的整个被消灭。
    这里我们必须认清楚两点：第一，北平是通过和平谈判的方式来达到的、而不是象天津那样用武力来获得的。然而，假若没有林彪聂荣臻两位将军指挥下的几十万人民解放大军的紧密包围，假如没有天津解放的活生生的例子摆在面前，假如反动派感觉到还有可挣扎的余地的话，通过和谈方式来达到解放，是不能想象的。我们应当认清楚，用和谈方式能够得到解放的主要原因，就是人民革命的力量，尤其是人民解放军的革命力量。
    北平和平解放第二点意义，是北平解放虽然用和平谈判方式来达到，用和平的方式来接收政权机构，而且暂时尽量要保持原来的系统。但这绝对不是说北平的解放，是带有改良意味或带有妥协意味的。绝对不是的，北平的解放必然是一次不折不扣的革命的解放。这样的通过和谈方式的革命，只有切实依据人民领袖毛泽东先生的八项和平主张，才能实现。我们民主同盟一向主张真正的彻底的和平必然是民主的和平，必然是革命的和平。因此我们坚决、诚恳、热烈地拥护毛泽东先生的八项和平主张。一切和谈，只有根据这八项和平主张作为最低限度的先决条件，才能达到全国人民所要求的真和平——彻底的、民主的、革命的和平。
    但是蒋介石、李宗仁也在来谈和平，说为的是要“救人民于水火”。我们老早洞烛其奸，指斥他们玩的是假和平的阴谋。最近一个多月来的事实，完全证明我们的判断没有错误。三年来的历史，充分证明了蒋介石李宗仁之流正是替人民制造水深火热的专家，他们是三年前破坏和平、发动内战、拍卖祖国的罪魁。这一个多月来，李宗仁在幕前唱和平戏，蒋介石在幕后积极布置抵抗人民解放军的反革命军事；孙科又厚颜无耻地邀请国际帝国主义者出来干涉中国内政，美国帝国主义仍在或明或暗地积极支持蒋介石李宗仁。在这样的情势之下，对于国民党反动派的假和平的阴谋，我们应予彻底粉碎！
    但是尤其重要的是，我们一刻也不能忘记美帝国主义的另一套阴谋，那就是他除积极支持一切反革命残存势力之外，更在拚命侵入革命阵营内部来布置各式各样的阴谋诡计。特别重要的一着，就是美帝国主义无孔不入地在找寻机会，制造一种“反对派”“在野派”之类的组织，企图来破坏中国人民的胜利。对于这类阴谋，我们民主党派，民主人士，必须团结起来，坚决彻底粉碎它！
    最后我要高呼：
    坚决拥护毛主席的八项和平主张！
    彻底粉碎反革命的假和平阴谋！
    中国人民解放万岁！
