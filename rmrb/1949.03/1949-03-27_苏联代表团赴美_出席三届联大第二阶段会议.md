    [Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 24th] TASS Moscow: The Soviet delegation to the second stage of the Third United Nations General Assembly has been appointed by the Soviet Council of Ministers and departed from Moscow for New York on the 22nd.

The delegation of the Belorussian Soviet Republic, headed by Kiselev, also left for New York on the same day. The Ukrainian Soviet Republic has appointed Tarasenko, currently in New York, as the head of its delegation.
    Note: The Third United Nations General Assembly was held in Paris on September 21st last year and adjourned on the evening of December 12th. Due to the US-British bloc forcibly including many issues that violated the Charter and should not have been included on the agenda, several minor issues remained undiscussed at the end of the meeting. By decision of the General Assembly, these issues will be discussed at the second stage of the Third General Assembly, which will reconvene at the United Nations Headquarters in New York on April 1st.

　　苏联代表团赴美
  　出席三届联大第二阶段会议
    【新华社陕北二十四日电】塔斯社莫斯科讯：苏联出席联合国第三届大会第二阶段会议的代表团，业经苏联部长会议派定，并已于二十二日自莫斯科首途赴纽约。代表团团长为苏联第一副外长葛罗米柯，团员为苏外次兼驻安理会代表马立先、驻英大使查鲁滨、驻美大使潘友新及苏联驻安理会副代表萨拉普金。以基塞列夫为首的白俄罗斯苏维埃共和国代表团亦于同日启程赴纽约。乌克兰苏维埃共和国已任命刻在纽约的塔拉森科为其代表团团长。
    按：联合国第三届大会于去年九月二十一日在巴黎举行，至十二月十二日晚停止工作。由于美英集团以许多违犯宪章不应列入议程的问题强行列入议程，以致在会议结束时，尚有若干次要问题未被讨论。经大会决定，这些问题交由四月一日在纽约联合国总部复会的第三届大会第二阶段会议讨论。
