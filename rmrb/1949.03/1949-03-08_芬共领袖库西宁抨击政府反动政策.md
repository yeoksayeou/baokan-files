　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, March 6th: TASS, Helsinki: On February 23rd, the Finnish Parliament held a debate on the Agrarian League's interpellation regarding the land policy pursued by the Social Democratic Party's Fagerholm government.

　　Ms. Kuusinen, leader of the Finnish People's Democratic League (note: composed of the Communist Party and the Social Unity Party) parliamentary group, delivered a speech during the debate, not only sharply criticizing the Social Democratic government's land policy, but also sharply criticizing its entire policy, and demanding a change in this policy. She said: The government is in fact unwilling or unable to explain what responsibilities it intends to undertake to improve the living standards of workers, peasants and other working people. Kuusinen further emphasized: At present, the shadow of economic crisis is looming again in various capitalist countries. Promoting political and trade relations with countries beyond the economic crisis on the basis of mutual trust is very important not only for Finnish agriculture but also for the entire Finnish national economy. Kuusinen concluded her speech by saying: Broad sections of the people demand a democratic economic policy, which includes increasing the purchasing power of working people, stopping wage cuts, stopping price increases for manufactured goods, eliminating unemployment, implementing economic plans, expanding construction plans, reducing capitalists' profits, increasing the income of small farmers, regulating prices, and guaranteeing the sale of agricultural products.

　　After the debate, the Parliament held a vote and "passed" a vote of confidence in the government. The Finnish Communist Party's newspaper "Kansan Sanomat" pointed out: In fact, the vote of confidence in the government was passed by cabinet members who are also members of parliament. The parliamentary presidium arbitrarily invalidated two votes of no confidence. If the votes cast by government cabinet members who are also members of parliament are deducted, then only eighty-nine votes were in favor of the government, while ninety-six votes were against. The Fagerholm cabinet is actually a minority party cabinet.

　　芬共领袖库西宁抨击政府反动政策
    【新华社陕北六日电】塔斯社赫尔辛基讯：芬兰议会于二月二十三日就农民党对社会民主党法吉荷尔政府所奉行的土地政策提出质问，展开辩论。
    芬兰人民民主联盟（按系由共产党与社会统一党组成）议会党团领袖库西宁女士在辩论时发表演说，不仅尖锐抨击社会民主党政府的土地政策，并且还尖锐抨击它的全部政策，而且要求改变这种政策。她说：政府事实上不愿或不能说明它打算承担些什么责任，以改进工农及其他劳动人民的生活水平。库西宁进一步强调称：目前，经济危机的阴影又在各资本主义国家隐约出现。与超乎经济危机之外的国家在互相信任的基础上促进政治与贸易关系，不仅对芬兰农业而且对芬兰的全部国民经济都是很重要的。库西宁在其演说的结语中称：广大阶层的人民，要求民主的经济政策，这种政策包括提高劳动人民的购买力，停止减低工资，停止提高制造品的价格，消除失业，实行经济计划，扩大建设计划，减少资本家的利润，提高小农的收入，调节物价，以及保证农产品的销路。
    议会在辩论后举行表决，“通过”了对政府的信任票。芬共机关报“杜坎森·杉诺玛”报指出：实际上，对政府的信任票是由阁员兼议员通过的。议会主席团曾专横地使两张不信任票作废。如果把政府阁员兼议员所投的票扣除，那么，就只有八十九票赞成政府，而反对的便有九十六票。法吉荷尔姆内阁实际上是少数党内阁。
