　　Five Hundred Special Agents in Beiping Register: Lenient Treatment for Those Who Repent and Start Anew; Those Who Persist in Their Errors Will Not Escape the Net of Justice
　　[Report from this newspaper] Since the Beiping Municipal People's Government announced the "Measures for Registration of Self-Renewal by Kuomintang Special Agents," more than 500 people have gone to various sub-bureaus to register in the past ten days or so. They expressed their willingness to bow their heads to the people, confess their guilt, repent, and start anew, and reported their past evil deeds to the People's Government, surrendering their credentials. It is reported that the People's Government is beginning to grant lenient treatment based on the frankness and degree of repentance of the special agents who have registered for self-renewal. On the other hand, the broad masses of citizens are helping the People's Government to expose special agents, and many letters of exposure are received every day, making it difficult for those who evade registration and persist in their errors to escape the net of justice.

　　平市五百特务登记  悔过自新从宽处理  执迷不悟难逃法网
    【本报讯】平市人民政府公安局公布了“国民党特务人员自新登记办法”以后，十余日前往各分局登记的人已有五百人。表示他们愿意向人民低头认罪悔过自新，并且向人民政府报告他们过去的罪恶行为，交出了证件。据息人民政府正在着手根据特务自新人员的坦白及悔过程度分别予以从宽处理。另外方面，广大市民帮助人民政府检举特务分子，每日收到检举信件多封，这使逃避登记及执迷不悟者决难逃法网。
