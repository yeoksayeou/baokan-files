　　From the coasts of England to the three islands of Japan, from Sydney in Australia to Narvik in Norway, the movement of hundreds of millions of people against war and in defense of peace continues to surge and expand. This is the most important political event in the world today.
　　Peace-loving people around the world have mobilized, and two international peace conferences, one about to open and one in progress, are underway. The largest "World Congress of Defenders of Peace" is scheduled to open in Paris on April 20th. As of March 25th, democratic and peace groups representing 300 million organized masses have expressed their support for this congress and will send representatives to participate. Preparing to participate in this conference are not only delegations from the Soviet Union, China, and all New Democratic countries, but also numerous delegations from important capitalist countries. Another conference, called the "Scientific and Cultural Conference for World Peace," convened in New York, USA, and opened on March 25th. This conference was initiated by 600 American scientists, university presidents, artists, writers, etc., who invited renowned artists and scientists from more than twenty countries to the United States to participate. On the eve of the conference, the U.S. State Department suddenly announced that it would refuse to issue passports to representatives from Britain, France, Italy, and other countries to go to the United States. This reactionary move by the U.S. government actually demonstrates its fear in the face of the peace-loving forces of the people of the world.
　　The peace movements around the world are closely linked to the mass movements against the signing of the North Atlantic Treaty, and the purpose of these movements is to prevent the outbreak of a new war of aggression. The North Atlantic Treaty, planned by U.S. imperialism, has been fiercely opposed by peace-loving people all over the world, but after lengthy negotiations with representatives from the United Kingdom, France, Canada, Belgium, the Netherlands, Luxembourg, and Norway, U.S. imperialism announced it on March 18th and scheduled it to be signed in Washington on April 4th. The announcement of this infamous treaty has aroused fierce opposition from progressive groups and progressive public opinion in various countries, especially within the countries preparing to participate in this treaty. The struggle against joining the North Atlantic Treaty is most prominent in France and Italy. France has become the center of activities for the people of capitalist countries to oppose the North Atlantic Treaty and oppose new wars. In Italy, when the parliament discussed whether to join the North Atlantic Treaty, as Communist Party member of parliament Arrigata said, "The voices of millions of Italian citizens resounded in the parliament hall, opposing the government's decision to join the North Atlantic Treaty." The debate in the Italian lower house was unprecedentedly fierce, with more than 150 members of parliament speaking out against joining the North Atlantic Treaty.
　　The eagerness of the American reactionaries to sign the North Atlantic Treaty exposes the deep crisis of American capitalism. There are more and more signs that the American economic crisis is coming, not only relative overproduction, but also a sharp decline in industrial and commercial activity, a decline in total wages, and a continued increase in unemployment. The sharp decline in industrial and commercial activity is particularly noteworthy. According to U.S. News magazine, non-metallic production has fallen by 11 percent compared to its post-war high, machine manufacturing has fallen by 7 percent, coal production has fallen by 16 percent, railway freight volume has fallen by 13 percent, and new orders in industry have fallen by 12 percent. The most resilient parts of post-war industrial production—the steel and automobile industries—are also beginning to show signs of weakness. (Xinhua News Agency, March 30th)

专栏：国际一周

　　国际一周
    从英伦海岸到日本三岛，从澳洲的悉尼到挪威的那维克，千百万人民反对战争与保卫和平的运动，继续汹涌澎湃地扩大。这是世界今天最重要的政治事件。
    世界各地爱好和平的人民，已经动员起来，两个国际性的和平会议，一个即将开幕，一个正在举行。规模最大的“世界拥护和平大会”，定于四月二十日起在巴黎举行。到三月二十五日为止，已经有代表三万万有组织群众的民主团体与和平团体，表示支持这一大会，并将派遣代表参加。准备参加这一会议的，不仅是苏联、中国和所有新民主主义国家的代表团，而且有重要资本主义国家众多的代表团。另一个会议在美国的纽约召开，叫做“科学文化界保卫世界和平大会”，已于三月二十五日开幕。这个会议是由美国六百个科学家、大学校长、艺术家、作家等发起，他们曾邀请二十几个国家的著名艺术家和科学家赴美参加。在会议前夕，美国国务院突然宣布拒发护照给英、法、意等国赴美的代表。美国政府的这种反动的举动，实际上正是表示了它在全世界人民和平力量面前的恐惧。
    世界各地的和平运动和反对签订北大西洋公约的群众运动密切地联系着，这些运动的目的，都是为了阻止新的侵略战争的爆发。由美帝国主义策划的北大西洋公约，虽然遭到全世界爱好和平人民的反对，但美帝国主义经与英、法、加、比、荷、卢、挪诸国代表长时期的谈判之后，已于三月十八日宣布，并订于四月四日在华盛顿签字。这个臭名远扬的公约的公布，更引起了各国进步团体和进步舆论的猛烈反对，特别是在准备参加这一公约的国家之内。反对参加北大西洋公约的斗争，在法国和意大利最为突出。法国成为资本主义国家人民群众反对北大西洋公约，反对新战争的活动的中心。在意大利，当议会讨论是否参加北大西洋公约的时候，象共产党议员阿里加塔所说的，“议会厅里发出了意大利千百万公民的呼声，反对政府参加北大西洋公约的决定。”意大利下院的辩论空前激烈，陆续发言反对参加北大西洋公约的国会议员在一百五十名以上。
    美国反动派之急于签订北大西洋公约，暴露美国资本主义危机的深重。美国经济危机将要到来的征候已经越来越多，不只是生产相对过剩，而且工商业活动急剧下降，工资总数也已下降，失业者仍在增多。工商业活动的急剧下降特别值得注意。据美国新闻杂志说：目前，非金属的生产与战后的高度相比已下降百分之十一，机器制造已下降百分之七，煤产已下降百分之十六，铁路运货量已下降百分之十三，工业中的新定货已下降百分之十二。战后工业生产中最坚挺的部分——钢工业和汽车工业，也开始显露疲弱的迹象。（新华社三十日电）
