　　1. The division headquarters of the annihilated 20th Division and its subordinate 58th, 59th, and 60th Regiments, as well as the remnants of the 40th Regiment of the 14th Division. Captured alive were Chu Jingya, commander of the 20th Division, Zhang Linghan, chief of staff of the division (previously mistaken for Zhang Qinghan), Liu Fengxue, commander of the 58th Regiment, Li Zixun, commander of the 59th Regiment, Shi Yi, deputy commander of the 60th Regiment, and Li Guangjun, acting commander of the 40th Regiment of the 14th Division, and other officers and soldiers totaling 1,563; 260 enemy troops were killed or wounded, for a total of 1,823 enemy troops killed, wounded, or captured.
　　2. Seized: 7 82mm mortars, 13 60mm mortars, 26 heavy machine guns, 45 light machine guns, 533 rifles and carbines, 23 short guns, 10 Sten submachine guns, 2 carbines, 810 shells of various types, 123,000 rounds of rifle and machine gun ammunition, and some other military supplies. Note that the 20th Division was completely annihilated for the third time by the People's Liberation Army in Yongfeng Town last November. The Hu bandits barely pieced it together with security forces, so both men and weapons were understrength.

　　陕中泾阳口头镇之战
  　我军歼敌一千八百
    【新华社陕中前线五日电】人民解放军西北野战军司令部公布本月一日在泾河北岸泾阳县属之口头镇附近地区歼灭敌七十六军之二十师（敌对外称三十三师）及十四师之四零团残部之战果如下：
    一、歼敌廿师师部及所属之五十八、五十九、六十等三个团及十四师之四零团残部。生俘二十师师长褚静亚，师参谋长张凌汉（前误为张清汉），五十八团团长刘奉学，五十九团团长李子勋，六十团副团长史镒及十四师之四零团代理团长李光军等以下官兵一千五百六十三名；毙伤敌二百六十名，共计毙伤俘敌一千八百二十三名。
    二、缴获：八二迫击炮七门，六○炮十三门，重机枪二十六挺，轻机枪四十五挺，步马枪五百三十三支，短枪二十三支，司登式冲锋枪十支，卡宾枪二支，各式炮弹八百一十发，步、机枪弹十二万三千发，其他军用品一部。按二十师去年十一月在永丰镇被解放军第三次全歼，胡匪以保安部队勉强拼凑编成，故人枪均不足额。
