　　Central Plains Field Army Unit
    Studies and Implements Urban Policy
    [Xinhua News Agency, Central Plains, 22nd] A unit of the Second Field Army of the People's Liberation Army convened a meeting of regimental and battalion political work cadres on the 7th of this month to study the implementation of urban policies, discipline, and urban takeover issues. During the meeting, the unit's leaders reported that the Chinese revolutionary struggle had changed from liberating the countryside first and then the cities to liberating the cities first and then the countryside. Therefore, the People's Liberation Army must learn to take over and participate in urban work. During the meeting discussions, the representatives believed that in the past, some personnel had a lack of understanding of the situation and a lack of correct understanding of the Party's urban policies, which had led to the phenomenon of damaging cities. In the future, education should be carried out among cadres and soldiers to make them clearly realize that the cities liberated in the future will always belong to the people. The people's cities are of great significance in supporting the revolutionary cause and carrying out economic construction. In the liberated cities, urban discipline such as keeping everything intact, strict guarding, confiscating and turning over to the public, and unified distribution should be strictly enforced.

　　中原野战军某部
    研究执行城市政策
    【新华社中原二十二日电】人民解放军第二野战军某部于本月七日召开团营政治工作干部会议，研究执行城市政策、纪律及接管城市等问题。会中该部首长报告称：中国革命斗争已经由过去先解放乡村后解放城市，而改变为先解放城市后解放乡村，因此，解放军必须学会接管和参加城市工作。在会议讨论中，与会代表认为过去部分人员由于对形势认识不足，对党的城市政策缺乏正确认识，曾产生了破坏城市的现象。以后应在干部与战士中进行教育，使他们明确认识到今后所解放的城市将永远是人民的。人民的城市在支持革命事业和进行经济建设方面有很重要的意义。在解放的城市应严格执行原封不动、严格看守、及缴获归公、统一分配等城市纪律。
