　　North China Transportation Conference Concludes, Decides to Strengthen Road Maintenance Work
    Emphasizes Relying on the Masses to Manage Highways
    [This newspaper's report] The first North China Transportation Conference concluded on the 29th after lasting for half a month. Attendees included: the North China Highway General Bureau, the Postal General Bureau, the Hebei-Central, Hebei-Shandong-Henan, and Hebei-South Transportation Offices, the Taihang, Taiyue, and Jinzhong Transportation Sections, the Hebei-East Transportation Bureau, the Chahar, Changzhi, Shexian, Handan, Xingtai, Shijiazhuang, Hebei-Central, Hebei-South, and other transportation companies, and the Dezhou, Linqing, and Hengshui shipping companies, totaling more than twenty units. This transportation conference began by pointing out that, due to the expansion of the North China region, the leadership was not providing timely leadership to local transportation departments, and the integration of transportation companies with industrial and commercial enterprises was not close enough. Road repair was mainly for military tasks (which was completely correct), but once the military tasks were over, no one paid attention to it, and repairing them again when needed resulted in a serious waste of manpower and resources. In the past, during wartime, various places also built a lot of highways. Now that North China has entered the stage of production and construction, based on the above situation, the transportation conference emphasized the issue of road maintenance in the future. The conference unanimously agreed that it is necessary to organize and lead the masses to manage highways. In order to ensure the integrity of the highways and prevent damage, it is strictly forbidden for iron-wheeled carts to travel on the highways. In order to reduce the burden on the people, automobiles and horse-drawn carts must pay a road maintenance fee of 5% to 8%, which will be uniformly managed by the North China Highway Transportation General Bureau to organize road management stations. In addition, at this conference, it was proposed to transportation companies in various places: further enterprise management, economic accounting, business policies, the integration of transportation with mass production, bus transportation networks, and management system methods, all of which were discussed by small groups, individual talks, and general discussions, and unanimous opinions were obtained. Regarding postal transportation issues, in the future, the transportation of mail on bus routes and highway trunk lines throughout the region, those under 100 catties will not be charged transportation fees, in order to reduce postal expenses. Rural postal and telecommunications will temporarily maintain the status quo, and rural postal services will still be supplied and led by local authorities. Zhang Wen'ang, Deputy Minister of Transportation, emphasized in his closing remarks that issues such as road construction, road maintenance, and transportation must be combined with the broad masses of the people. He also called for overcoming the tendency of enterprises to become bureaucratic and establishing a people-serving perspective in thought and style.

　　华北交通会议结束决定加强养路工作
    强调依靠群众管理公路
    【本报讯】华北首次交通会议历时半月于二十九号结束。出席会议者有：华北公路总局，邮政总局，冀中、冀鲁豫、冀南交通处，太行、太岳、晋中交通科，冀东交通局，察哈尔、长治、涉县、邯郸、邢台、石家庄、冀中、冀南等地运输公司，德州、临清、衡水船运公司等二十余单位。这次交通会议着手指出：由于华北地区的扩大，领导上对各地交通部门领导不够及时，运输公司与工商企业部门，结合不够密切。修路主要是为军事任务（这是完全对的），一旦军事任务过去，就没人过问，再用时再修严重的浪费了人力物力。过去在战争情况下各地亦修了不少的公路。现在华北已进入生产建设阶段，根据以上情况，交通会议强调提出了今后养路问题，大会一致认为必须有组织有领导依靠群众去管理公路，为了保证公路完整与不受损害，严禁铁轮大车在公路上通行。并为减轻人民负担，汽车马车须缴纳百分之五到百分之八的养路费，该费由华北公路运输总局统一掌握，组织管路栈。此外在此次会议上对各地运输公司提出：进一步的企业化、经济核算、经营方针、交通与群众生产结合，班车交通网，及管理制度办法等，均经小组酝酿、个别交谈、大会讨论，均获得一致意见。关于邮政运输问题，今后全区的班车、公路干线上的邮件运输，百斤以下者不拿运费，以减轻邮政的开支。乡邮、电讯、暂维持原状，乡邮仍由地方供给领导。交通部张文昂副部长在大会的结束语中，强调的指出，修路、养路、运输等问题，必须与广大的群众相结合。并克服企业机关化，从思想上、作风上树立为人民服务的观点。
