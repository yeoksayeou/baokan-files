[JiluYu Telegram] To solve the urgent need for textbooks in schools throughout the region, workers at the JiluYu Xinhua Bookstore Printing Plant enthusiastically launched a major production competition. After the Xinhua Bookstore Printing Plant was assigned the task of printing 200,000 copies (i.e., 2.7 million impressions) of textbooks for senior and junior elementary and middle schools within one month and five days, the workers calculated that, working nine hours a day with three machines, they could only print 36,000 impressions per day. In one month and five days, they could print 1.26 million impressions, leaving a huge number of 1.24 million impressions unfulfilled. Under these circumstances, after everyone's deliberation and discussion, the workers voluntarily proposed a competition, increasing the daily working hours from nine to twelve. The workers set their own plans. After the campaign was launched, the Wang Hanping team exceeded the standard number by 5,300 impressions. The Li Peichang team printed 12,000 impressions, reaching an unprecedented standard, increasing production to double the initial plan. Based on these figures, more than 70,000 impressions can be printed every day, and there is complete confidence that the task will be completed as scheduled.

  　日夜加工赶印课本
    【冀鲁豫电】冀鲁豫新华书店印书厂工人为解决当前全区学校对课本的迫切要求，热烈展开生产大竞赛。新华书店印书厂，在分担了必须在一月零五天印出的高、初小学及中学二十万册（即二百七十万印）课本的任务以后，工人们即计算按每天以九小时的工作时间，三部机子，每天只能印刷三万六千印，一月零五天，能印一百廿六万印，还有一百廿四万印的庞大数目不能完成。在此种情形之下，经过大家的酝酿讨论，工人们就自动提出竞赛，每天工作时间由九小时增加到十二小时，工人们纷纷定出自己的计划。运动展开后，工人王汉平班，已超过了标准数的五千三百印。李培常班印到一万二千印，达到空前标准。提高生产达最初计划的一倍。根据此种数字计算，每天可印到七万多印，如期完成任务已有完全把握。
