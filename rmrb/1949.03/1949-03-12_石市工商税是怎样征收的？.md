How is the Shijiazhuang Municipal Industrial and Commercial Tax Collected?
　　　　Xin Ru

　　Shijiazhuang's industrial and commercial tax collection work in the second half of 1948, after learning from the experience and lessons of the first half of the year, smoothly completed the task of collecting 10,000 dan of millet as expected.

　　The collection of industrial and commercial tax in the first half of the year was a new task after the liberation of the city. There was a lack of understanding of the situation. For example, when distributing tax quotas to the cooked food industry, only 33 households were reported, but 128 households were found. For the cotton weaving industry, the distributed quota was 295 households, but there were only 147 households. Cadres lacked experience and easily believed the lies of merchants. They did not have enough assessors, and unevenness occurred. This time, after careful planning and full preparation, there were significant improvements in the collection.

　　This collection work began on November 27th of last year. First, a meeting of managers of industrial and commercial households throughout the city was convened to conduct propaganda, clarify the significance of taxation, and review the shortcomings of the tax collection work in the first half of the year. At the same time, it was emphasized that the election of assessors and the investigation of actual number of households are the key to achieving reasonable burden. These two tasks were completed within a week. Cadres participating in various industries reported to the tax commission every other day. Leaders exchanged experiences based on various situations and solved problems at any time.

　　The qualifications of assessors should be good character and familiarity with the industry. It is best to have representatives from large, medium, and small households elected. According to the size or nature of the industry, the following methods were adopted for election: (1) Nominating candidates at the general meeting; (2) Nominating candidates in each group; (3) Combining election and appointment; (4) Appointing all members in industries where the masses were not mobilized.

　　The lessons learned from the tax collection in the first half of the year made merchants recognize the work better. For example, the cart industry had 59 households, eight groups, and was divided into four grades and twenty-one levels. Because individual large households manipulated the distribution as assessors, the burden was extremely unreasonable. This time, the assessors were elected fairly. Everyone had experience and launched a heated discussion. Some rose from Grade C to Grade A, and some fell from Grade B to Grade D. Such a large change corrected the bias of the previous time. Some merchants were afraid of trouble, afraid of offending people, or behaved like old rulers trying to take the lead and gain advantages, which was also very common. For example, Yongxinxing Restaurant, the largest restaurant in the city, manipulated and acted arbitrarily as an assessor in the first half of the year, increasing the burden on small and medium-sized households, and as a result, the allocated quota was not fully collected. Because the small households in the industry were not awakened, he was elected again this time. There were more than 200 restaurants in the industry. The leadership found the cause of the election failure, divided the industry into two groups, exposed the reasons for the unfair burden in the first half of the year, and changed to using the method of each group nominating candidates. After three reviews, his conspiracy finally failed.

　　In order to evade taxes, merchants did not hesitate to use deceptive methods such as false industry changes, closures, and new openings to deceive the government. For example, Renhe Department Store claimed to be newly opened by changing to the cigarette business. A grocery store in the Garden Market obtained both large and small business licenses. When collecting taxes from large businesses, they claimed to be small businesses, and when collecting taxes from small businesses, they claimed to be large businesses. Some opened half a door and posted a sign saying "Closed for Business," but still traded as usual inside. Exposing these tax-evading or downplaying merchants mainly relied on mobilizing the masses to report. However, most merchants were afraid of offending people or believed that increasing the number of households would increase the tax burden of the entire industry, which would not benefit them. For example, someone in the grocery industry said, "Squeezing out small households will offend people and hurt yourself." Because these ideological obstacles were not eliminated, the masses were not easily mobilized, and the effect was less.

　　The assessment work was distributed to the industry and municipal levels. The tax amount was not announced in advance, but was tentatively assessed at 1,000 points, and then combined into millet. The assessment standards in the industry were generally based on the tax amount of each household in the first half of the year and the business situation in the second half of the year. However, because the nature and management methods of each industry were different, several special circumstances had to be taken into account: (1) Comparing size: comparing business size, number of people, location, duration, amount of capital, etc. This type is suitable for industries that are generally not easy to account for, such as groceries, department stores, grain, cloth, etc. (2) Assessing quantity: Warehouses, hotels, inns, cart inns, and butcher shops rely on commissions from guests, buying and selling on behalf of guests, or doing business themselves. (3) Assessing tools, output, and sideline occupations: Used in industries such as textiles, electric mills, ironworks, and soap making. (4) Assessing net profit: With regular reports and sound accounts, only the banking industry uses this method. Based on the above common and special conditions, the assessors or groups drafted a draft of the industry's score and discussed it repeatedly. At the same time, cadres consulted individual households to remedy the defects that merchants were afraid to speak up in meetings. Reducing one's own burden and increasing others' is a concentrated manifestation of merchants' selfishness. For example, the warehouse industry had 58 households, divided into seven groups and fifteen assessors. In the first discussion of the draft by each group, only groups two and three spoke, and the remaining five groups were silent with protests. Later, the assessors decided at a meeting to transfer the assessors of each group to participate in other groups to urge them to speak. In the second discussion, four or five more groups formally raised opinions, and groups one, six, and seven remained silent. Only after the assessment was made did they realize that the assessors had assessed themselves. The manager of Jiyisheng Tannery was honest and did not like to talk, so everyone saw that he was easy to bully and increased his burden. Liang Cunshan, the representative of the electrical materials store, was upright and worked actively, and everyone hated him and deliberately increased his burden, ironically saying, "Old Liang will never think it's too much." For these relatively good merchants, the cadres generally supported them and relied on them as the backbone. From the two tax collection works, the general cadres experienced a better way to control the meeting: before the meeting, they should enlighten more and start discussions, listen more and talk less after everyone has talked enough, and then draw conclusions, and organize and summarize the merchants' disordered opinions to tell them what to do.

　　Understanding the situation of various industries from industry assessments laid the foundation for the municipal assessment work. The Municipal Assessment Committee hired 20 members, 15 from private industrial and commercial sectors and 5 from relevant agencies and organizations. The Municipal Assessment Committee announced that the total tax amount was 10,000 dan of millet. In advance, the leadership drafted a tax quota allocation plan for each industry. When announcing the draft at the meeting, it explained the basis, changes in the number of households in each industry (closures, openings, increases and decreases in large and small households), and business conditions: including the size of profits and the speed of capital turnover, and adjusted the parts where the tax amounts of each industry were uneven in the first half of the year. Because of the consideration of the situation of industry, etc., the total tax amount in the draft was increased to 10,400 dan to ensure that the original tax amount would not be reduced. Because the leadership accurately estimated the affordability of each industry, the assessors passed it with very little modification after discussion. The masses also reflected that this time was relatively fair and reasonable.

　　Promoting the development of industry and commerce that are beneficial to the national economy and people's livelihood through tax work is an important policy of the New Democratic economy. According to the provisions of the draft industrial and commercial tax of the North China Taxation Bureau, which reduces 1/5 to 3/5 of various light and heavy industries, only one iron factory that also makes machines and two alkali cooperatives in the city can receive reductions. Similar iron industries that manufacture agricultural tools are still closely related to the national economy and people's livelihood under the current circumstances. Based on this specific situation, appropriate care was given to general industry and independent laborers in the municipal assessment. Some who had heavy family burdens or other reasons for living difficulties (such as being bombed by Chiang Kai-shek's planes) were also given appropriate reductions and exemptions.

　　石市工商税是怎样征收的？
    辛茹
    石市一九四八年下半年工商税征收工作，在接受上半年经验教训之后，很顺利地预期完成了一万大石小米征收的任务。
    上半年征收工商税是本市解放后一个新工作，不了解情况，如熟食业在分配税额时只报了三十三户，结果查出一百二十八户，棉织业分配时是二百九十五户，结果只有一百四十七户。干部缺乏经验。轻易相信商人谎言；掌握评议员不够，曾发生轻重不匀的现象，这次经过周密的计划和充分的准备，在这次征收中就有了很大的改进。
    这次征收工作于去年十一月二十七日开始，先召集全市工商户经理开会，进行宣传，阐明征税意义，检讨上半年征收工作缺点；同时提醒选举评议员及调查确实户数，是使负担达到合理的关键，这两项工作在一周内完成了，参加各行业工作的干部，隔天向征委会汇报一次，领导上根据各种情况交换经验，随时解决问题。
    评议员的条件要为人正派并熟悉全行情形，最好是大、中、小户都有人当选，根据行业大小或性质不同，采取了以下几种方式进行选举：（一）大会提出候选人；（二）各小组中提出候选人；（三）选举与聘请兼施；（四）群众没有发动起来的行业全部聘请。
    从上半年税收的教训中，使商人对这个工作在认识上进了一步。如大车业五十九户，八个小组，分四等二十一级，因为个别大户评议员操纵分配，负担极不合理，此次评议员选得公正，大家有了经验，展开热烈讨论，有的从丙等升到甲等，有的从乙等降到丁等，这样大的更动，纠正了上次的偏向。有的商人怕麻烦怕得罪人或以旧的统治者姿态出现的抢领导占便宜的现象也很普遍。如饭业永信兴，是全市最大的饭馆，上半年担任评议员操纵专断，加重了中小户负担，结果没有征足分配数量，因该业中小花户没有觉悟，这一次他又当选了，饭业共有两百多户，领导上找出选举失败症结，把该业分成两股，揭穿上半年负担不公平的原因，并改用各组提候选人的方式，经过三次审查，终于使他的阴谋失败。
    商人们为逃避纳税不惜用假转业、歇业、新开业等欺骗政府的方式，如人和百货店借改业纸烟说是新开张，花园市场一家杂货店领了大商小商两种营业证，大商征税他是小商，小商征税他又在大商，有的开着半扇门贴着“停止营业”的条子，里面却照常交易。揭露这些漏税或大化小的商户主要靠发动群众检举，但一般商人都怕得罪人或认为户数增加，全行税额也要增加与自己无好处，比如杂货业有人说：“把小户挤出来，得罪了人自己还要吃亏。”因为有这些思想上障碍，没有得到消除，群众不易发动起来，收效较少。
    评议工作分布与行业两级，专前未宣布税额，暂且按一千分评定，然后再合成小米，行业中评议的标准；一般的是根据上半年各户的税额及下半年营业情况，但因为各行业性质及经营方法不同；同时还得照顾几种特殊情况：（一）比个子：比业务大小、人数多少、地址好坏、时间长短、资金多少等，此类适用一般不易算帐的行业如杂货、百货、粮食、布匹等等。（二）评数量：货栈、旅馆、客店、大车店、肉铺等行业是靠住客抽佣钱、代客买卖或自己兼做买卖。（三）评工具、产量、副业：用于纺织、电磨、铁工、造胰等工业。（四）评纯利：有定期的报表，健全的帐目，只有银行业采用此法。根据以上共同的及特殊的条件，由评议员或小组拟订出全行业分数草案反复讨论。同时干部从旁征询个别花户意见，以补救商人们怕在会议中说话得罪人的缺陷。减轻自己加重旁人，是商人自私自利的集中表现。如货栈业五十八户，分七个小组，十五个评议员，第一次各小组分别讨论草案只有二、三两个组有人发言，其余五个组沉默中有抗议，事后评议员开会决定各组的评议员互相调开参加别个小组督促发言，第二次讨论，正式提意见的多了四、五两组一、六、七三组仍然沉默，到评定以后才发觉是评议员们把自己评住了。积义盛制革厂经理很老实不爱说话，大家见他好欺负就加重他的负担。电料行代表梁村山为人正派工作积极，大家痛恨他故意给他加重，反讽刺的说：“老梁绝不会嫌多。”对这些比较好的商人，干部们一般都支持他们，依靠他为骨干，从两次税收工作中，一般干部都体验到一个掌握会场比较好的方法：在开会之前要多启发，展开讨论以后多听少说，大家谈得差不多了再做结论，把商人缺乏次序的意见组织归纳起来告诉他们怎样做。
    从行业评议中了解了各行业的情形，给市评议工作奠定了基础，市评议会聘请了二十个委员，私人工商业十五人，有关机关团体五人，市评议会宣布总税额为一万大石小米，事前领导上拟出各行业税额分配草案，会议上宣布草案时并说明根据，各行业户数变动情形（歇业开张，大小户增减）及营业情况：包括利润大小及资金运转速度，并将上半年各行业税额轻重不匀的部分加以调剂；因为有照顾工业等情形，草案中总税额提高为一万零四百大担，以保证了原定税额不致减少。由于领导上估计各行业负担能力的准确，评议员讨论经过很少修正就通过了。群众反映也认为这次是比较公平合理的。
    通过税收工作，奖励发展有益国计民生的工商业，是新民主主义经济的重要方针，按照华北税务总局工商税草案中各种轻重工业减五分之一到五分之三的规定，本市能受减免的只有一家兼制机器的铁工厂和两家酸碱合作社，类似制造农具的铁工业在目前情形下，还是密切地关系着国计民生，根据这种具体情形，在市评议中对于一般工业和独立劳动者都给了适当的照顾。有些因家庭负担重或其它原因生活困难者（如遭蒋机轰炸），也酌予减免了。
