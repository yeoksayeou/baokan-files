Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, March 16th: TASS reported on the 13th that Wallace, on the second anniversary of the implementation of the "Truman Doctrine," issued a statement stating that the "Truman Doctrine" has failed in Greece and Turkey, just as it has suffered an even greater failure in China. He pointed out that under the "Truman Doctrine," aid given to the reactionaries in Greece and Turkey has reached more than ten billion dollars. Wallace said: The "Truman Doctrine" once misrepresented this as essential for Greece and Turkey in military and economic terms. However, the truth is that the so-called "rebels" in Greece—leaders of the anti-Nazi resistance movement—are becoming increasingly strong in a military sense. The true situation in Turkey is also similar. Therefore, the military and economic aspects of the "Truman Doctrine" have failed in both of these countries, just as it has suffered a greater failure in China. Wallace declared: Now is the time to stop this policy, which demands that more and more American gold and dollars be thrown into the bottomless pit of militarism to support increasingly corrupt regimes, depriving the people of the world of security and peace. Now is the time for the American people to demand that the government end this foreign policy, which only means more and more waste of national expenditure, buying neither security nor peace. The timing is even more urgent now because the government is trying to fool American taxpayers in order to carry out a new massive plan to turn Europe into a military camp. Wallace called for an end to the "Cold War" and for a resolution of the differences between the two countries with the Soviet Union, so that the two countries can work together for peace and world construction.

　　华莱士发表声明
    指出“杜鲁门主义”已失败要求政府改变外交政策
    【新华社陕北十六日电】塔斯社十三日讯：华莱士今日在“杜鲁门主义”实施两周年发表声明称：“杜鲁门主义”正如它在中国遭受更大规模的失败一样，它在希土两国中也同样失败了。他指出，在“杜鲁门主义”下给予希腊与土耳其反动派的援助已达十余亿元。华莱士说：“杜鲁门主义”曾经曲解这为希腊和土耳其这两个国家在军事与经济上之所必需。但是，真实的情况是希腊的所谓“反叛者”——反纳粹的抵抗运动领导者——在军事意义上正日益增强中。土耳其的真情也是如此。所以军事与经济的“杜鲁门主义”在这两个国家中都失败了，正如它在中国遭受到更大规模的失败一样。华莱士宣称：现在是制止这个政策的时候了，这政策要求将愈来愈多的美金和美元投进军事的无底洞里，来支持日趋腐烂的政权，剥夺全世界人民的安全与和平。现在是美国人民要求政府结束政府该项外交政策的时候了，这种外交政策只是意味着愈来愈多的浪费国家开支，而所买的既不是安全，也不是和平。现在的时机更加紧迫了，因为政府正在试图愚弄美国纳税人，借以进行一个新的庞大计划，将欧洲变成一个军营。华莱士号召结束“冷战”，并和苏联解决两国的纷歧，这样，两国才能同为和平与世界建设而奋斗。
