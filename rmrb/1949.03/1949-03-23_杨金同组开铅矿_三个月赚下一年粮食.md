　　Yang Jintong's Group Opens Lead Mine
    Earns Next Year's Grain in Three Months
    [Our Dispatch] Near Baijiazhuang in Jianping First District, after the discovery of a lead mine, the masses of Baijiazhuang and Heishankou were the first to start mining. Due to the government's large-scale purchases, the profits were huge, which aroused the enthusiasm of the villagers of Shagou to mine. Twelve households in the village jointly opened a lead mine, but due to lack of experience, they spent more than thirty workdays digging one kiln without much gain, and everyone's morale was very low. Yang Jintong, a poor peasant, sixteen years old, had worked as a worker in Shanxi and mined minerals. He joined the group to help everyone dig elsewhere. Following the lead ore veins of other kilns, he led everyone to dig for two days and unearthed lead ore. After that, everyone trusted and supported him even more, and elected him as the team leader. After Yang Jintong took office as the team leader, he became even more active. Although he was young, he did not lag behind in production at all. Everyone said, "With Team Leader Yang in our team, production is going well." Under the leadership of Yang Jintong, everyone mined more than 200,000 catties of lead ore in three months, earning 80,000 yuan in People's Currency, which was equivalent to 32 large shi of rice at the then-current grain price. This solved the problem of livelihood for the whole year.

　　杨金同组开铅矿
    三个月赚下一年粮食
    【本报讯】建屏一区白家庄附近，自发现铅矿以后，白家庄、黑山口群众首先开掘。由于公家大量收买，获利巨大，激起了沙沟村民开矿的积极性。该村有十二户自行合伙去开铅矿，但由于经验少，开掘了一个窑，化费了三十多个工，也没有什么收获，大家情绪很低落。贫农杨金同，十六岁，已往在山西当过工人，开掘过矿物，他便入伙，帮助大家另地开掘。他按着其他窑洞的铅矿脉线、领导大伙开掘了两天，就挖出了铅矿，此后大家更加信任与拥护他，公举他当组长。杨金同自任组长后，更加积极，他虽然年岁小，但在生产上，一点也不落人后。大家都说：“俺们组里有了杨组长，生产闹好了。”大家在杨金同领导下，三个月挖出铅矿二十余万斤，得人民币八万元，按当时的粮价折米三十二大石。解决了全年生活问题。
