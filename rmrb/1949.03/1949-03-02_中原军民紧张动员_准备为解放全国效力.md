Xinhua News Agency, Central Plains, 27th—The military and civilians in the Central Plains Liberated Area are intensively carrying out various preparations in order to serve the liberation of all of China. The People's Liberation Army units are now stepping up their training, and conducting education on urban policies and new area policies. The newly liberated soldiers in the various units have greatly improved their political awareness after receiving grievance education. They have successively proposed that they will make better contributions to the people in the future. All officers and soldiers of the uprising unit, the 110th Division, are responding to Chairman Mao's call, striving to study, improve their political awareness and military skills, so as to quickly reach the level of the people's army. Local armed forces in various places, under the slogan of "Making contributions to the liberation of all of China," are requesting to be upgraded to the main force. In the three districts of Yu-Wan-Su, more than 8,500 local armed forces were honorably promoted to the main force in January. More than 1,000 local armed forces in western Henan have also gloriously entered the field army. At the same time as the local armed forces are being upgraded to the main force, mass voluntary military service movements are being carried out enthusiastically in various regions. According to extremely incomplete statistics, in the past three months, more than 13,000 young people in the three districts of Yu-Wan-Su, western Henan, and Tongbai have joined the People's Liberation Army. In Huaiyang, influenced by 30 cadres taking the lead in joining the army, more than 500 young people have poured into the People's Liberation Army. Schools in various places have also launched a mobilization upsurge of "liberating all of China." The first batch of graduates from the Central Plains Military and Political University, hundreds of people, have arrived at the front line and formally participated in the work of the troops. Students and teachers from the Yu-Wan-Su Construction College and Luoyang Public School have also jointly requested to participate in the work of the troops.
    
Xinhua News Agency, Central Plains, 28th—In order to victoriously welcome the great task of liberating all of China, all personnel of the direct units of the Central Plains Field Army are stepping up their study of current affairs and various policies of the Chinese Communist Party. The Party Committee of the direct units of the Central Plains Field Army convened an enlarged meeting of the Party Committee on February 7 to deploy the study tasks for the entire team. The meeting decided that all cadres should study "Carry the Revolution Through to the End," Chairman Mao's statement on the current situation, and various documents of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China on urban and rural policies. Education on observing discipline and implementing policies should be strengthened for soldiers. The meeting instructed all units that in study and education, (1) cadres and soldiers should be repeatedly and deeply explained the various favorable conditions for liberating all of China, and at the same time, it should be explained that in order to liberate the suffering people in the Kuomintang-ruled areas, they should be ideologically prepared to endure hardship and overcome various difficulties. (2) Expose the Kuomintang reactionaries' fake peace conspiracy, educate soldiers to improve their vigilance and strengthen their political sense of responsibility, and carry the revolution through to the end. (3) Thoroughly liquidate and overcome the erroneous ideas that may arise at the critical juncture when the revolution is about to win a nationwide victory, such as personal enjoyment, fear of difficulties, indifference to and sabotage of the party's policies and discipline, and uneasiness in work, and overcome various anarchist and undisciplined thoughts and actions.
