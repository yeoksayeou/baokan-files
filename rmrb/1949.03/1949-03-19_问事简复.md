　　Brief Replies to Inquiries

　　Ji Yang: You are a worker, but your family background is that of a landlord. After the purge, no one in your family can work, and you have difficulty making a living. You wish to return home and participate in agricultural production. If the land rights in your village have not been finalized, you can ask the factory where you work to issue a certificate and apply to the village farmers' association for land distribution. Additionally, if you wish to use small loans to organize your family to engage in domestic industrial production, you can apply directly to the Cooperative Bank. (The address of the Cooperative Bank is the former site of the China Farmers Bank, and it will be open for business soon.)

　　Wang Zhiwen: Overseas trade and shipbuilding are now under the management of the Tianjin Foreign Trade Administration. If you wish to engage in the repair and maintenance of fishing boats, please contact the Administration directly.

　　Mr. Haixiao: Regarding the marriage issue you raised, if it is indeed as you stated, "the relationship between the two parties has deteriorated, and they cannot live a happy married life," either party can apply to the government for divorce.

　　Mr. Gong Yinqiu: Regarding the five questions you asked, questions two, four, and five cannot be answered because the information you provided is not clear enough, and it is also unclear whether it is true. The other two questions are answered briefly as follows:

　　(1) The policies for industry and commerce are consistent in both old and new areas. However, in terms of land reform, the implementation in new areas differs from that in old areas, depending on the specific circumstances at the time and place. Please refer to the "Instructions of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China on Ending Land Reform and Party Consolidation Work in 1948" dated May 25, 1948.

　　(2) If it is indeed a friendly interest-free loan, rather than a loan relationship between a landlord and a farmer, it should be decided by both parties. If the two parties cannot decide, it can be decided by the local democratic government.

　　Mr. Zhao Xiong: A certain coal mine in Mentougou owes you coal and has been delaying repayment for a long time. You can file a lawsuit with the local People's Government. The People's Government works for the people and does not charge any fees.

　　Ms. Jiang Wei: The answers to the questions you raised in your letter are as follows:

　　(1) The eight conditions for peace talks in Chairman Mao's statement on the current situation on January 14th are: 1. Punish war criminals; 2. Abolish the pseudo-constitution; 3. Abolish the pseudo-legal system; 4. Reorganize all reactionary troops according to democratic principles; 5. Confiscate bureaucrat-capital; 6. Reform the land system; 7. Abolish traitorous treaties; 8. Convene a political consultative conference without the participation of reactionary elements.

　　(2) You asked what is New Democracy, Socialism, and Communism. Please refer to the "Study and Discussion" column on the third page of the Beijing Liberation Daily on March 15th, which contains a relatively concise explanation.

　　(3) Young people who are out of school and unemployed can apply to the North China People's Revolutionary University, the North China Military and Political University, the North China University, the Southbound Work Group, and other technical schools.

　　(4) After being admitted to the Revolutionary University, students are of course allowed to go home to visit on Sundays, but going home too frequently without important matters is not good for studying. As for the treatment, it can only be in accordance with the provisions in the enrollment brochure, and family members cannot be treated as military dependents.

　　(5) The address of North China University has not been determined yet. You can go to No. 38, Dongsi Liutiao, Ping City, to inquire about the temporary address.

　　Mr. Yu Qingchi: Private mining of minerals should be registered with the local government's Industry and Commerce Section and procedures should be completed. If there are indeed difficulties in resuming work, the People's Bank can grant loans depending on the situation. You can directly contact the Industry and Commerce Section of the Fangshan County Government and the County Bank.

　　Wu Xiaonan, Wang Naili, Tan Zhijun: Air Force technical personnel can still register with the Aviation Department at the former site of the Austrian Embassy in Dongjiaominxiang.

　　Chen Zhujiu, Wang Ren, Xu Yongchang, Wei Shijie, Zhang Chuanrong, Wang Kechang, He Dianchun, Wang Zhenduo, Han Yongxing, Lu Changqing, Ding Yi, Zhao Qimin, Zhao Shiqin, Li Guisheng and other gentlemen:

　　If you are returning home through the liberated areas within the customs, you can go to the district public security sub-bureau where you currently reside to complete the procedures. If you are going out of Shanhaiguan or to the KMT-controlled area, you must first apply to the district public security sub-bureau where you currently reside, and then take the sub-bureau certificate to the municipal public security bureau to obtain a pass.

### 问事简复

专栏：社会服务

　　问事简复
    吉羊：你本人是工人，你家庭成份是地主，被清算后无人劳动，生活困难，你本人愿回家参加农业生产，若你村地权尚未最后确定，可请所在工厂开列证明信件，向你村农会申请分田。另外你若愿用小宗贷款，组织你家人从事家庭工业生产，可直接向合作银行申请（合作银行地址为原中国农民银行旧址，不日即将开始营业。）
    王志文：关于海外贸易及造船事业，现在统归天津对外贸易管理局管理，你如愿从事渔船修装事业，请迳向该局接洽即可。
    海啸先生：你提出的婚姻问题，如果确实象你所说的，“双方感情恶化，不能过夫妇的美满生活，”任何一方都可向政府申请离婚。
    龚吟秋君：你询问的五个问题，其第二、四、五三个问题，因你介绍的情况不够清楚，同时，也不了解是否属实，故不能答复。另外两个问题，简复如下：
    （一）工商业政策，不管老区、新区，在执行中皆是一致的。但在土地改革方面，新区与老区，在执行中，依据当时当地的具体情况，有所不同。希你参看一九四八年五月二十五日，中共中央关于一九四八年结束土改与整党工作指示。
    （二）如果确实属于友好的无息借款、而非地主同农民的借贷关系者，当由双方决定。如果双方不能决定者，可由当地民主政府决定。
    兆熊君：门头沟某煤窑欠你煤炭，长期施延不还，可向当地人民政府进行诉讼。人民政府是为人民办事情的，不收任何手续费。
    姜薇君：今将你来信所提的几个问题，答复如下：
    （一）毛主席于一月十四日关于时局声明中的八项和谈条件是：一、惩办战争罪犯；二、废除伪宪法；三、废除伪法统；四、依据民主原则改编一切反动军队；五、没收官僚资本；六、改革土地制度；七、废除卖国条约；八、召开没有反动分子参加的政治协商会议。
    （二）你问什么是新民主主义、社会主义、共产主义，请参看三月十五日北平解放报第三版学习讨论栏，其中有比较简明的解释。
    （三）失学失业的青年，可以去投考华北人民革命大学、华北军政大学、华北大学、南下工作团，以及其他技术学校等。
    （四）考入革命大学后，星期日当然允许学生回家看看，不过没有要紧事情，回家太频繁对学习上也没有好处。至于待遇，只能按招生简章上所规定的，家属不能按军属待遇。
    （五）华北大学地址尚未确定，临时住址你可到平市东四六条三十八号去探询。
    于清池君：私开采矿产，应向当地政府的工商科呈请登记，并办理手续，如确系复工有困难者，人民银行可斟酌情形给予贷款，你可直接向房山县政府工商科及县银行接洽。
    吴效南、王乃立、谭致君：空军技术人员，仍可到东交民巷奥国大使馆旧址航空部进行登记。
    陈铸九、王仁、徐永昌、魏时杰、张传荣、王克常、何殿春、王振铎、韩永兴、陆长卿、丁一、赵启民、赵世琴、李贵生诸君：
    你们回家，如经关内解放区，可向你现住地的区公安分局办理手续即可；假若出山海关或到蒋管区去，则须先至你现住地区公安分局申请，然后持分局证件，再到市公安局领取通行证。
