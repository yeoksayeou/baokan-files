　　Enthusiastic Southern Expedition
  　Brief News of Welcoming Southern-Bound Cadres from Various Regions
    ◇ On the morning of the 25th of last month, all the agencies and organizations of the Taihang First District held a meeting at the Xingtai People's Grand Theater to welcome more than 300 cadres heading south. The entire meeting proceeded in a solemn, joyful, and cordial atmosphere. First, Deputy Commissioner Sun delivered a welcoming speech, followed by a speech by Comrade Liu Zhenbang from the District Committee. In their speeches, they offered earnest words of encouragement, from concrete life issues to the study of theoretical policies, with meticulous care. Comrade Chang Huazhi, the former District Committee member, said in his reply as a representative of the southern-bound cadres: "This kind of warm and great encouragement makes me deeply feel the love and warmth of the great revolutionary family." After the meeting, the yangko teams from various streets performed programs such as "Crushing Chiang Kai-shek's False Peace Conspiracy," "Little Flower Play of Zuoquan," "Crossing the Yangtze River," "Congratulatory List," and "Victory Dance."

    ◇ Thirty-two cadres from Shahe heading south set off on the 15th of last month. All the personnel of the county government and the villagers stationed in the villages gathered in the streets, beating gongs and drums to see them off. Everyone sincerely entrusted and encouraged each other. Secretary Jia said in his farewell message: "Comrades have accepted the glorious task given by the Party to go south. I hope that you will closely connect with the local masses, help the elders and folks in Jiangnan to stand up, and bring our consistent hard-working style to Jiangnan..." The Deputy Secretary of the County Party Committee said: "Whether going south or north, we must carry the revolution through to the end. Everyone must remember: do not take credit, do not be complacent, learn with an open mind, and improve your theory." In the speeches, both sides shouted slogans to each other: Ensure that the families of the cadres going south do not suffer difficulties…Serve the people wholeheartedly, and resolutely help the elders and folks in Jiangnan to stand up…Take care of your health…

    ◇ After two days of current affairs study and mobilization, Jingxing County convened a mobilization meeting for all cadres heading south on the 6th of last month. The County Party Secretary called on everyone to firmly establish a revolutionary outlook on life and to carry the revolution through to the end throughout the country. The cadres heading south all happily expressed their attitudes one by one. For example, Deputy County Chief Ma Ziqing said: "I am very happy. The task given to me by the Party is glorious. I will definitely complete it resolutely, and I am willing to carry out the revolution to the end together with all the comrades present!" At the end of the meeting, everyone stood in silence and solemnly swore an oath to the Party in front of a huge statue of Chairman Mao.

    ◇ At the self-registration meeting for cadres heading south in Xingtang, everyone was very excited and volunteered to register. For example, Yang Anju, the director of the Women's Federation of the Second District, said: "In the past, women were not allowed to join the army. This time I must go south!" More than 50 people volunteered, all willing to take on the glorious task of going south.
　(Jia Zemin, Huo Lingcheng)
    ◇ After Comrade Yang Lufeng of the Dongming County Government in the Hebei-Luyu region volunteered to go south, he went home the next day to inform his family. Who knew that his father already knew. As soon as he saw him, he said: "I have already heard that you are going south. I am very happy. I have told everyone at home, and they all agree." When he returned to the county, the old man sent him out of the village and told Lufeng: "Help the people of Jiangnan stand up well, don't worry about the family, take care of your health..."

    ◇ Seven cadres from the Fourth District of Cixian County are heading south, and their morale is very high. They have all studied current affairs and documents such as "Carry the Revolution Through to the End" in the county, and everyone's thinking has improved a step. Armed Committee member Zhang Qi came from a background as a hired laborer. This time, he vowed to resolutely fight against the landlord and feudal forces in Jiangnan and help the poor to stand up. He said: "Family is a small matter, nothing is more important than revolution." Zhang Zicang said excitedly: "Nothing else, I will not return to my hometown until the Kuomintang reactionaries are eliminated!"
