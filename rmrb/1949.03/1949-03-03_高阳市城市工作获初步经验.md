Gaoyang City Obtains Preliminary Experience in Urban Work

　　Since its establishment, the Gaoyang City Party Committee has transformed its rural viewpoint and old leadership methods in leading mass work. Preliminary achievements and experiences have been gained in workers' work.

　　In the five months after its establishment, due to unfamiliarity with urban work, certain deviations existed in the understanding of urban characteristics, policies, and organizational leadership. Seeing that the citizens ate and dressed well, were polite, and unwilling to accept land, the cadres thought that they were feudal, backward, leading corrupt lives, politically inactive, and merchant-minded, and were unwilling to approach them. Some cadres (especially female cadres), seeing that the flower-printing female workers dressed well while they themselves dressed poorly, were unwilling to lead them. They did not realize that they were all working people and the basic forces for building the city. In mobilizing and organizing workers, the workers' immediate interests were not resolved, but rather simply emphasizing organization; therefore, they were organized in the front, and collapsed in the rear. Comrade Zhao of the Women's Federation organized two female worker groups in the printing factory, but they collapsed without playing any role. Departments were acting independently, without close coordination. For example, the trade union only focused on the organization and leadership of factory workers (which was correct), while neglecting and relaxing the leadership of street odd-jobbers and contracting workers. Youth and women cadres only paid attention to street youth and women, and rarely went to factories to organize youth and women workers. Because youth and women workers had all gone to the factories, even street youth and women organizations could not be established. Due to the existence of these problems, many cadres, although busy all day, did not make significant achievements.

　　The City Party Committee immediately conducted a review based on the above situation. First, it convened a meeting of cadres from various departments to unify the cadres' thinking, clarified the importance of workers' work in the city, and strengthened the connection between the work of various departments. The City Party Committee decided that one youth cadre and one woman cadre should participate in the Workers' Union Committee. The Women's Federation absorbed women cadres from the government's Civil Affairs Section, the bank, and the Public Security Bureau to jointly study women's work.

　　In order to ensure that workers' lives were not affected by price fluctuations and to implement the policy of benefiting both labor and capital, all wages were changed to in-kind wages. Contracts were signed under the voluntary agreement of both labor and capital, and the workers' lives were guaranteed. For example, Tian Guiting in Xiguan had three young female flower-printing workers in her family, who received 200 jin of millet, which solved the family's livelihood problem. Worker Zhang Di said: "This time, with the implementation of in-kind wages, my family's life will no longer be a problem." The workers' lives were guaranteed, and their awareness was also improved. The workers recognized that the trade union was their own organization, and the workers' production enthusiasm was also improved.

　　Due to caring about the interests of the masses and helping them solve problems, as well as the close cooperation of various departments, women's work and youth work have also been carried out. The Women's Federation organized 172 female flower-printing workers. Thirty-eight female flower-printing workers in Nanjie also joined the trade union. The Youth League organized 55 young workers in the Jianhua Factory, and 23 people have already filled out applications to join the League. The Fifth Street also established a Youth League Preparatory Committee and is preparing to build the League.

### 高阳市城市工作获初步经验

　　高阳市城市工作获初步经验
    高阳市自建立以来，市委对群众工作的领导上，转变了农村观点和老一套的领导方法。工人工作获得了初步的成绩和经验。
    在成立后的五个月当中，由于对城市工作的生疏，对城市特点的认识上、方针上以及组织领导上，都存在着某些偏差。看到市民吃的好，穿的好，对人客气，不愿要土地等，干部就认为他们是封建落后，生活腐化，政治不开展，商人意识，而不愿意接近他们。有的干部（特别是妇女干部）看见刷花的女工穿的好，自己穿的不好，就不愿去领导。没有认识到他们都是劳动人民，是建设城市的基本力量。在发动与组织工人中，没有解决工人的切身利益，而是单纯强调组织；所以前边组织，后边垮台。妇会赵同志到印花厂组织了两个女工组，丝毫没起作用就垮了。在各部门各自为政，没有密切结合，如工会只着重了对工厂工人的组织领导（这是对的），而忽视和放松了对街关散工和包工工人的领导。青年和妇女干部，只注意了街关青年与妇女、很少到工厂去组织青年和妇女工人。因为青、妇女工人都到工厂去了，以致街关青妇组织也没有建立。由于以上这些问题的存在，许多干部虽整天忙，也没有做出显著成绩。
    市委即根据以上情况，进行检讨，首先召开了各部门干部会议，统一了干部思想，明确了城市中工人工作的重要性，加强了各部工作的联系。市委确定青妇干部各一人参加职工会的委员会。妇会吸收政府民政科、银行、公安局的妇女干部共同研究妇女工作。
    为了保证工人生活在物价波动中不受影响，贯彻劳资两利方针，一律改为实物工资。在劳资双方自愿下，订立了契约，工人生活得到了保证。如西关田桂庭家里有三个刷花青年女工，即得小米二百斤，解决了全家生活问题。工人张弟说：“这次实行实物工资，我家生活就不成问题了。”工人在生活上得到了保障，觉悟也提高了。工人认识了工会是自己的组织，工人生产情绪也提高了。
    由于关心群众利益并帮助他们解决了问题，以及各部门工作密切配合，妇女工作和青年工作也开展起来。妇会组织起了刷花女工一百七十二人。南街三十八个刷花女工也参加了工会，青年团在建华工厂组织起青年工人五十五人，已有二十三人填了入团志愿书。五街也建立了青年团筹委会正在准备建团。
