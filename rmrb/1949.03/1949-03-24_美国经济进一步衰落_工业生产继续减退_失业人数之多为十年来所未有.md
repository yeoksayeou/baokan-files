　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, March 23rd: TASS, New York, March 21st dispatch. The U.S. economic situation in the past week reflects a further decline in the U.S. economy. Production in many industrial sectors continues to decrease. According to U.S. newspaper reports, coal production from January 1st to March 12th decreased by 23 million tons compared to the same period last year. In the week ending February 12th, electricity production also decreased by approximately 21 million kilowatt-hours. Railway freight car loadings in the same week decreased by 87,100 cars compared to the same period last year, and 131,800 cars compared to the same period in 1947. The situation for automobile production is similar, with some independent automobile manufacturers, such as "Kaiser-Frazer" and "Hudson," already reducing production. The domestic market continues to shrink, with sales volume significantly lagging behind last year's levels. According to the Federal Reserve Board's estimates, department store sales in the week ending March 12th decreased by 8% compared to the same period last year. Sales of some consumer goods show catastrophic declines. Despite the Marshall Plan, the export market continues to shrink. According to a report from the U.S. Department of Commerce, total exports in January were $1,008,500,000, while in December of last year, they were $1,283,000,000. The continuous shrinking of the market has made the prices of many industrial products increasingly unstable. Newspapers report almost daily on various industries continuing to lay off workers. General Electric estimates that it has laid off nearly 4,000 workers since the beginning of this year. A Detroit correspondent for a business magazine reported that there are currently 81,000 unemployed in the area, compared to 36,000 in December of last year. According to a United Press dispatch from San Francisco, a delegation from the San Francisco CIO Council met with the mayor to request an increase in unemployment benefits. The committee representatives told the mayor that in all the industrial sectors they represent, the number of unemployed is the highest it has been in ten years.

　　美国经济进一步衰落
    工业生产继续减退
    失业人数之多为十年来所未有
    【新华社陕北二十三日电】塔斯社纽约二十一日讯，过去一周中，美国经济情势，反映出美国经济的进一步衰落。许多工业部门的生产，继续减退。据美国报纸消息，自一月一日至三月十二日，煤产量较去年同期减少了二千三百万吨。在截至二月十二日为止的一周年中，电力生产也减少约二千一百万千瓦。同一周中的铁路货车载运量，较去年同期减少八万七千一百节车厢，较一九四七年同期减少十三万一千八百节车厢。汽车生产的情形也是一样，某些独立的汽车制造商，如“凯塞·佛莱塞”、“哈德逊”等公司，已经减少生产。国内市场继续缩小，货物的销售量大大落后于去年水平。据联邦储备局的估计，百货公司售货量，在截至三月十二日为止的一周内，较去年同期减少了百分之八。某些消费品的出售量，显示出灾难性的下跌。虽有马歇尔计划，出口市场仍继续缩小。据美商务部报告：一月份出口总值为十亿零八千五百万元，而去年十二月份，则为十二亿八千三百万元。市场的不断缩小，使许多工业品的价格日益不稳。报纸几乎每日均报导有各工业继续解雇工人的事情。通用电气公司估计，该公司自今年初以来，几已解雇工人四千名。商业杂志底特律访员报导，该区现有失业者八万一千，而去年十二月则为三万六千。据报业联合通讯社旧金山电，旧金山产联委员会代表团曾往见市长，要求增加失业者的救济金。委员会代表告市长称，在他们所代表的一切工业部门中，失业人数为十年来所未有。
