The Northeast Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, the Northeast Administrative Committee
Instructions on Strengthening Political and Cultural Education Among Workers

    With the liberation of Northeast China and the establishment of the New Democratic regime, the working class has transformed from an oppressed class to the leading class of the people's regime. In state-owned enterprises, they have changed from wage slaves to masters of the enterprise. To consolidate their hard-won victory and advance the complete victory of the national revolution, and to shoulder the responsibility of leading the entire people in building a prosperous and happy new Northeast and new China, the working class must greatly enhance their class consciousness and cultural and technical level. Only by mastering advanced human science and culture and technology can the working class lead the country further forward. Especially at present, in all aspects of economic, political, and cultural construction, the participation of numerous worker cadres is necessary to ensure the smooth progress of various New Democratic construction works, especially economic construction. Therefore, strengthening political and cultural education among the working masses and cultivating worker cadres is an urgent and important task.

    Due to the great victory of the Northeast Liberation War, the liberation of all industrial cities in Northeast China, economic construction, and primarily the recovery and construction of industry, is the overriding central task for the future. Therefore, how to organize the working masses and improve the class consciousness and political, cultural, and technical level of the working class is an immediate and significant task. Therefore, the Party's cultural and educational work should pay special attention to this aspect and plan to genuinely improve the cultural level of the working class in three to five years. From among the working masses, we must cultivate thousands upon thousands of cadres with high class consciousness and considerable cultural level to participate in government organs and economic management organs in order to victoriously complete the great construction tasks before us.

    To unfold political and cultural education among the working masses, the trade union should bear the primary responsibility. At the same time, it is also the task of all Communist Party organizations in the city. The Party should mobilize organs, organizations, and schools in the city to vigorously assist the trade union in carrying out this work. It should guide Party members organized in all organs and school branches to take turns going to factories and among the working masses to work and learn from the working masses. Literary and artistic work groups and literary and artistic workers should take organizing and improving worker culture as their glorious task and go among the workers to develop worker literature and art. Only when the entire Party strengthens this work from all aspects can this work be rapidly developed. Therefore, the following instructions are hereby made:

    I. Develop spare-time education for workers and staff

    (A) In the past, the education work carried out by trade unions in various factories and enterprises focused on large lectures, explaining class viewpoints, current affairs, and policies. This was entirely necessary for conducting preliminary political education among workers in all newly liberated cities and was successful in initially enlightening workers and staff. However, at present, this alone can no longer meet the needs of the broad masses of workers. Many workers now demand more systematic political knowledge and improved cultural and technical learning. Therefore, spare-time education should be systematically managed in the future. This can be roughly divided into the following types:

    (1) Workers' remedial night schools. Enroll workers with a certain level of education to study courses such as political common sense, social science common sense, modern revolutionary history, and world knowledge. Responsible personnel from the Party, administration, and trade union in the factory will serve as teachers.

    (2) Spare-time technical training classes. Enroll young technical workers to teach them basic and practical technical theories, with technicians from the enterprise serving as teachers.

    (3) Literacy classes. Focus on teaching workers to read and eliminate illiteracy. Teach basic arithmetic, revolutionary history, geography, and other knowledge, with staff members from the enterprise or other enthusiastic worker educators serving as teachers. All three of the above can be universally implemented in all cities, counties, districts, industries, and enterprises with workers, according to the needs of the working masses.

    (B) In larger factories, clubs should be established under the leadership of the trade union to organize after-work singing teams, theater troupes, Yangko dance groups, and various sports teams, and to try to absorb workers and staff to participate. Various educational small-scale entertainment evenings should also be organized regularly.

    (C) In major cities, worker clubs should be established in worker areas to regularly organize lectures, evenings, and singing competitions, and various study groups should be organized to attract workers to participate and invite experts to guide them.

    (D) Small libraries should be established in trade union clubs in various factories and urban areas for workers and staff to borrow and read.

    (E) Establish a system of joint celebrations between organs, schools, and factories. Cadres and staff of each organ and school have the obligation to help nearby factories conduct political and cultural education. Cadres with a certain level of education should take turns going to factories in their spare time to help workers study and carry out entertainment activities.

    (F) The education bureaus of various cities should instruct their affiliated schools to make use of their teachers and classrooms to hold large numbers of worker night schools and to conduct literacy campaigns in worker residential areas.

    (G) The administrative departments of various enterprises should allocate a sum of money equal to 1.5% of the total wages of workers and staff each month to the trade union as education funds, starting from March of this year.

    (II) School Education

    (A) The Northeast Administrative Committee, in collaboration with the Northeast Federation of Trade Unions, will establish a Workers' Political University to enroll industrial workers with more than four years of work experience, a certain level of education (able to read the Northeast Daily and take notes), and progressive thinking. The first phase will tentatively enroll 1,000 students for a tentative study period of three months.

    (B) Cities such as Shenyang, Harbin, Changchun, Andong, Anshan, Fushun, Benxi, Xingshan, and Fuxin may, depending on the situation, establish worker political schools equivalent to the middle school level, or attach worker classes to existing middle schools or vocational schools, to be managed by the provincial and municipal governments in collaboration with the provincial and municipal federations of trade unions. Primary school graduates (able to read popular books and newspapers) will be recruited to study. The curriculum will focus on improving cultural, political, and social science knowledge, and graduates will be able to understand various basic tenets and policies of the New Democracy.

    (C) Vocational schools should be attached to major enterprises and factories to recruit children of workers and staff who have graduated from primary school to study technology and culture. They will work four hours a day and study four hours a day, graduating in four years to become junior technicians and skilled workers.

    (D) Schools for workers' children (complete primary schools) should be established in major enterprises and factories. The schools will provide books and supplies, and tuition will be free. Families with special difficulties will also be given considerable food subsidies.

    (E) City and county governments should establish more primary schools in industrial areas and near large factories and enterprises, and give preferential treatment to workers' children.

    (F) Various technical colleges and specialized schools run by government departments at all levels should give as much preferential treatment as possible to worker students so that workers can maximize their learning opportunities.

    (G) Students of the Workers' Political University and Workers' Political Schools will be provided with free food, lodging, clothing, books, and stationery by the school, and their original enterprises will pay two-thirds of their original wages to support their families until they graduate and determine their new jobs. Workers and workers' children who enter other schools run by the government will be exempted from tuition fees, and those with special difficulties will be given appropriate care.

    It is hoped that all localities will specifically discuss the above items, develop plans, and implement them step by step.

    (III) Compile and print books and reading materials for workers

    (A) Newspapers, news agencies, radio stations, and other news reporting agencies should appropriately increase the coverage and content of reports on workers and educating workers. In industrial cities, newspapers should be published primarily for workers, and worker correspondents should be developed in large numbers to improve their writing skills.

    (B) The Ministry of Education, in collaboration with the Northeast Federation of Trade Unions, will organize a textbook editing committee for workers, absorbing experienced personnel to compile textbooks for various vocational schools and popular readings on politics, economics, history, science, and other subjects.

    (C) The Northeast Federation of Literary and Art Circles and other cultural organizations should organize and mobilize literary and art workers to go deep into the working masses with the assistance of trade unions to guide workers' cultural and recreational activities, and to write works about workers, such as novels, dramas, songs, Yangko dances, comic strips, and cartoons reflecting workers' labor, struggle, and life. Efforts should be made to make them popular and to help workers establish literary and art groups to read progressive books, newspapers, and works, and to learn to write.

    (D) The Northeast Bookstore should include the publication of worker reading materials in its publishing plan and try to organize forces to rewrite existing works into popular versions. The prices of worker reading materials must be particularly low.

　　中共中央东北局、东北行政委员会
    关于加强工人群众中政治文化教育工作的指示
    东北解放，新民主主义政权确立，工人阶级已从被压迫地位变为人民政权的领导阶级，在国营企业中已从工钱奴隶变为企业主人。工人阶级要巩固其已得的胜利并推进全国革命的彻底胜利，要负起领导全体人民建设繁荣幸福的新东北与新中国的责任，就必须大大提高自己的阶级觉悟与文化技术水平。工人阶级只有掌握了人类先进的科学，只有掌握了人类先进的文化技术，才能领导国家更进一步的向前发展。特别在目前经济、政治、文化各方面建设，均须有众多的工人干部参加，才能使新民主主义的各项建设工作特别是经济建设工作顺利进行。因此，加强在职工人群众中的政治文化教育工作，培养工人干部是目前迫切的重大任务。
    由于东北解放战争的伟大胜利，全东北一切工业城市的解放，经济建设，首先是工业的恢复和建设是今后压倒一切的中心任务。因此如何组织工人群众，提高工人阶级的阶级觉悟与政治文化技术水平是目前刻不容缓的、具有重大意义的工作。所以党的文化教育工作也就要特别加强对这一方面的注意，要有计划地在三五年内把工人阶级的文化水平确实地提高一步，从工人群众中，培养出成千成万有高度阶级觉悟与相当文化水平的干部参加政权机关与经济管理机关，才能胜利地完成摆在我们面前的伟大的建设任务。
    展开在工人群众中的政治文化教育工作，首先是职工会应负的任务，但同时也是一切城市中共产党组织的任务。党应动员城市中机关、团体、学校，用大力来协助职工会进行这一工作。应指导一切机关、学校支部组织的党员轮流到工厂中到工人群众中进行工作，并向工人群众学习。文艺工作团体及文艺工作者，应以组织并提高工人文化为自己光荣的任务，到工人中去开展工人文艺。只有全党从各方面去加强这一工作，才能使这一工作迅速的开展起来。因此特作下列各项指示：
    一、开展职工业余教育工作
    （甲）职工会过去在各工厂企业中进行的教育工作，偏重于上大课，讲解阶级观点与时事、政策等。这对于在一切新解放的城市工人中进行初步的政治教育是完全必要的，对于初步启发职工觉悟是有成绩的。但目前仅仅如此，已不能满足广大工人群众的需要了。目前许多工人要求比较有系统的政治知识与提高文化技术的学习，因此今后业余教育要有系统地来办理。这大致可分为下列几种：
    子、工人补习夜校。招收有相当文化程度的工人学习，教以政治常识、社会科学常识、近代革命史、世界知识等课程。由工厂中党的、行政的、工会的负责人员担任教员。
    丑、业余技术补习班。招收青年技术工人教以粗浅的切于实用的技术理论，由本企业中的技术人员担任教员。
    寅、识字班。以教工人识字，扫除文盲为主。教以粗浅的算术，革命历史、地理等知识，由本企业中的工作人员或其他热心工人教育者担任教员。以上三项在凡有工人的城市及县区与产业及企业中，均可根据工人群众的需要，普遍实行。
    （乙）在较大的工厂中均应成立俱乐部，在职工会领导下，组织工余的歌咏队、剧团、秧歌、各种球队，尽量吸收工人职员参加，并应经常组织各种有教育意义的小型娱乐晚会等。
    （丙）在各大城市应在工人区域设立职工俱乐部，定期组织讲演会、晚会及歌咏比赛会等，并应组织各种学习小组，吸收工人参加，聘请专人指导。
    （丁）在各工厂及市区之职工俱乐部内均应设立小型图书馆，供职工借阅。
    （戊）建立机关、学校与工厂职工联欢制度。每个机关、学校的干部及工作人员，都有义务帮助其附近的工厂进行政治、文化教育工作。有文化程度之干部，要在工余之暇轮流到工厂中去帮助工人学习，进行娱乐活动。
    （己）各城市教育局应责成所属学校，利用其教员、教室、大量举办工人夜校，在工人住宅区亦应举办夜校，进行扫除文盲运动。
    （庚）各企业行政方面，应按月拨出等于职工工资总额百分之一·五的款项，交给职工会作为教育经费，从今年三月份起，开始实行。
    （二）学校教育
    （甲）由东北行政委员会协同东北战工总会开办工人政治大学、招收四年以上工龄、具有相当文化程度（能看东北日报、能写笔记）思想、进步的产业工人入学。第一期学生暂收一千人，学习期间暂定三个月。
    （乙）沈阳、哈尔滨、长春、安东、鞍山、抚顺、本溪、兴山、阜新等城市，可酌量情形举办相当于中学程度之工人政治学校，或在原有之中学或职业学校中附设工人班，由各省、市政府协同省、市职工总会办理，招收小学程度（能看通俗的书报）的工人入校学习。课程以提高文化、政治知识和社会科学知识为主，一年毕业，培养能明了新民主主义各种基本论点和各种政策的干部。
    （丙）在各大企业工厂中均应附设职业学校，招收小学毕业之职工子弟，半习技术，半习文化。每日工作四小时，学习四小时，四年毕业，以养成初级技术人员与技术工人为目的。
    （丁）各大企业工厂均应设立工人子弟学校（完整小学），由学校供给书籍用品，不收学费，家庭特别困难者，并予以相当之伙食津贴。
    （戊）各市、县政府，应在工业区及大工厂企业附近增设小学＜尽可能招收工人子弟上学，予以优待。
    （己）各级政府部门所办之各种技术专科学校，对工人学生应尽量予以优待，使工人能最大限度地获得学习机会。
    （庚）工人政治大学及工人政治学校之学生，均由校方免费供给膳、宿、服装、书籍、文具，并由本企业发给原有工资三分之二为供养家属费用，至毕业后确定新工作时为止。工人及工人子弟入政府所办之其他学校者，一律免收学费，特殊困难者，另予适当照顾。
    以上各项望各地具体讨论，定出计划，有步骤地贯彻执行。
    （三）编印工人书籍读物
    （甲）报纸、通讯社、广播电台等等新闻报道机关，应酌量增加报道工人与教育工人的篇幅和内容。在工业城市，应出版以工人为主要对象之报纸，并大量发展工人通讯员，提高工人写作的能力。
    （乙）由教育部协同东北职工总会组织工人教科书编辑委员会，吸收有经验的人员参加，编辑专供各种职工学校采用的教科书和政治、经济、历史、科学等通俗读物。
    （丙）东北文艺协会及其他文化团体应组织并动员文艺工作者，在工会协助下深入工人群众中指导工人文化娱乐工作，并编写有关工人的作品，如反映工人劳动、斗争与生活的小说、戏剧、歌曲、秧歌、连环画、漫画等，应力求通俗并帮助职工成立文艺小组，阅读进步书报、作品，学习写作等。
    （丁）东北书店应把出版工人读物列入出版计划之内，并尽可能组织力量将已有之作品改写为通俗本。工人读物定价须特别低廉。
