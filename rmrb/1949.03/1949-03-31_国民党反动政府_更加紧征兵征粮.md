　　The Kuomintang Reactionary Government
    Intensifies Conscription and Grain Collection
    After shouting an empty slogan of "quickly stopping conscription and grain collection," the Nanjing puppet Legislative Yuan is now replacing it with the formulation of practical steps to strengthen conscription. The subcommittee of the puppet Legislative Yuan responsible for reviewing the "Proposal to Quickly Stop Conscription and Grain Collection" submitted by several puppet legislators on the 8th of this month, passed eight principles for strengthening conscription on the 23rd, including measures to "abolish deferments," "completely prevent desertion," "reduce non-combatants," concentrate training, and forcibly upgrade local reactionary armed forces to supplement the reactionary regular army. In reality, the Kuomintang reactionaries' conscription and grain collection work in their controlled areas has not only never stopped, but has only intensified. As early as the 9th of this month, the Conscription Bureau of the puppet Ministry of National Defense had already announced that it would forcibly conscript two million able-bodied men this year. The passage of the resolution to strengthen conscription by the subcommittee of the puppet Legislative Yuan merely demonstrates to the people that, on the basic stand of continuing the counter-revolutionary civil war, they are no different from other Kuomintang reactionaries, including the puppet Ministry of National Defense.

　　国民党反动政府
    更加紧征兵征粮
    【新华社北平三十日电】南京伪立法院在发过一项“迅速停止征兵征粮”的空喊之后，现在正代之以制定加强征兵的实际步骤。伪立法院负责审查本月八日若干伪立委所提出的“迅速停止征兵征粮案”的小组委员会，已于二十三日通过加强征兵的八项原则，其中包括“取消缓役”、“彻底防止逃亡”、“缩减非战斗员”、集中训练及强迫地方反动武装升补反动正规军的办法等项。在实际上，国民党反动派在它的统治地区的征兵征粮工作，不但从未停止，而且只有日益加紧。早于本月九日，伪国防部兵役局即已宣布将于本年内强抓壮丁二百万人。伪立法院的小组委员会通过加强征兵决议，不过向人们说明，在继续反革命内战的基本立场上，他们与国民党其他反动分子，包括伪国防部在内，并无二致。
