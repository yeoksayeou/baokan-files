Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 2nd: Tokyo dispatch: Forty Japanese trade union leaders, including several leaders of the All-Japan Federation of Labor Unions and leaders of government employees' and private railway workers' unions, decided on February 24 to establish a central and local joint strike committee. The establishment of this organization is to resist the Yoshida government's anti-labor measures to decide on large-scale layoffs. The Yoshida Cabinet, at its cabinet meeting on February 25, decided to lay off 30 percent of its employees in the fiscal year beginning this April, namely 570,000 government employees and 300,000 public enterprise employees (currently, there are 2.9 million employees in government agencies and enterprises). The pretext is "administrative adjustment" and "industrial adjustment." Several large private companies have already begun large-scale layoffs in the past few weeks. The Japan Radio Corporation laid off 1,200 of its 3,600 employees. Japan Victor Record Company laid off 700 workers. Anda Electric Company laid off 1,000 workers.

    【新华社陕北二日电】东京讯：四十名日本职工会领袖，包括若干全日劳动组合联合会的领袖以及政府机关员工与私营铁路工人工会的领袖，已于二月二十四日决定建立中央与地方联合罢工委员会。这一组织的建立，是为了抵抗吉田政府决定大批裁员的反劳工措施。吉田内阁在二月二十五日的内阁会议上，已决定于今年四月开始的会计年度中解雇百分之三十的员工，即五十七万政府机关员工与三十万公共企业的员工（现在政府机关与企业的员工共有二百九十万人）其名义是“行政调整”与“工业调整”。若干私营大公司在过去数周内已开始大批解雇员工。日本无线电公司在其三千六百名职工中解雇了一千二百名。日本胜利唱片公司解雇了工人七百名。安达电气公司，解雇了工人一千名。
