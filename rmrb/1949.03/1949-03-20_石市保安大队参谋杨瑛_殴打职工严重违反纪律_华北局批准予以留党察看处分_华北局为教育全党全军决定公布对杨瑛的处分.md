Shijiazhuang Security Brigade Staff Officer Yang Ying
　　Severely Violated Discipline by Beating Employees
　　The North China Bureau Approved the Punishment of Probation Within the Party
　　The North China Bureau Decided to Publicize Yang Ying's Punishment to Educate the Entire Party and Army; the Factual Details of the Incident
　　[This newspaper] News: Yang Ying, a staff officer of the Shijiazhuang Security Brigade, and others illegally led armed forces to surround the city's Railway Factory, arresting and beating the factory's cadres, which was severely punished by the Shijiazhuang Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China. On the evening of January 8 this year, a few employees of the Shijiazhuang Railway Factory had an altercation with a teahouse attendant at the Xin Xin Theater due to rushing out first after the show ended, and the teahouse attendant was beaten. The platoon leader of the Second Platoon of the Security Third Company, who was on duty at the theater, went to stop them and wanted to take the fighting workers away, but the workers refused and beat the platoon leader. Secretary Zhang of the Railway Factory was also present at the time. Fearing an accident, he immediately stopped them and suggested resolving the matter at the Public Security Bureau. Two worker militia members and the security platoon leader went to the Public Security Bureau together. At this time, the duty member who followed the platoon leader ran back to the Third Company headquarters and exaggeratedly reported: "The platoon leader has been beaten to death and taken away by the workers." The company headquarters immediately reported to the brigade headquarters and assembled a platoon. Because it was late at night, only Staff Officer Yang Ying was awake when the brigade headquarters received the report. Yang briefly reported the incident to the brigade commander, who did not handle it himself at the time and told Yang, "The matter of the fight should be resolved by the Public Security Bureau. Go and investigate in detail yourself." At this time, the platoon leader and the two worker militia members who went to the Public Security Bureau did not go to the Public Security Bureau, but went to the Security Company first. When they arrived at the company headquarters, they encountered the platoon that had already assembled. The two worker militia members who came with them had their guns confiscated. Yang Ying and Song Fenglin, the captain of the Third Company, led a platoon of security guards to the Railway Factory, as if facing a formidable enemy, and implemented a blockade. Yang Ying also ordered: "If the workers resist, then fight!" "If Secretary Zhang (who had mediated the dispute in the theater) does not come, tie him up. If he resists, beat him, beat him to death, I'll take responsibility!" Song Fenglin, the captain of the Third Company, led his men to search everywhere but could not find Secretary Zhang. Instead, they found Comrade Kang Ruihua, the political commissar of the factory, and accused him of "organizing workers for counter-revolution!" They took Kang to the Third Company headquarters of the Security Brigade and detained him. Kang's communication officer who came with him was also disarmed, and Kang was forbidden to make phone calls or talk to the workers who were also detained. At this time, Secretary Zhang was returning to the factory when he was tied up by the security guards, beaten along the way, and taken back to the Third Company headquarters. They falsely accused Zhang of "organizing counter-revolution." Comrade Tan Yi, the secretary of the trade union, requested to come along to clarify the situation, but was also refused. By this time it was two o'clock in the morning. The Second Sub-bureau of the police station reported the matter to the Municipal Public Security Bureau. Wang Yingci, the director of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, immediately ordered Kang and Secretary Zhang to be released immediately and come to the Municipal Bureau, and telegraphed Cai Shengfu, the platoon leader leading the blockade of the Railway Factory, to immediately lift the blockade. At 3:00 AM on January 9th, Zhang, Kang, and the two worker militia members were sent to the Municipal Public Security Bureau. The Municipal Bureau immediately apologized to Comrades Kang, Zhang, and others, and dismissed and detained Yang Ying, Song Fenglin, and others, and went to the Railway Factory the next day to apologize to all the employees. After learning of this matter, the Shijiazhuang Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, after detailed investigation and serious discussion, considered that Yang Ying's actions exceeded the extreme and egregious criminal behavior of anarchism and lack of discipline. He should be severely punished, but Yang had admitted his mistakes and was willing to correct them through multiple interviews and education during detention. A lenient punishment of probation within the Party for half a year was given; and it was suggested that the Municipal Government dismiss the member and send him to the People's Court for sentencing. At the same time, Company Captain Song Fenglin and Platoon Leader Cai Shengfu were each given a demerit.
　　Municipal Party Committee Decision
　　[Another news] The Shijiazhuang Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, after a month of investigation and discussion on the illegal armed encirclement of the Railway Factory and the arrest and beating of the factory's cadres by Yang Ying, a staff officer of the Security Brigade in the city, made a decision on February 2nd, with the following key points:
　　The Municipal Party Committee believes that Yang Ying's actions were extremely egregious criminal acts that seriously exceeded general anarchy and lack of discipline. The Railway Factory is a state-owned factory, Political Commissar Kang is our Party's representative in the factory, Secretary Zhang is a revolutionary cadre, and the worker militia is the people's armed force. When a dispute occurred between the workers and the security team, Yang Ying and others dared to falsely convey orders without investigation, and arbitrarily directed the security team to surround, arrest, disarm, insult, detain, and even beat them, as if treating them as counter-revolutionaries. This is a warlordist act that completely loses the Communist Party's position, and is a crime that the Party cannot tolerate. All of our Party's work in the city must rely on the working class. Beating the masses of our own class and revolutionary cadres will inevitably and most seriously damage the relationship between the Party and the masses of our own class, causing irreparable losses to the revolution. In order to educate the entire Party and Yang, Song, and others themselves, the Municipal Party Committee decided:
　　1. Yang Ying is the main person responsible for this incident and should be given the most severe punishment. However, through multiple interviews and education during detention, he has admitted his mistakes and is willing to correct them. A lenient punishment of probation within the Party for half a year is given; and it is suggested that the Municipal Government dismiss the member and send him to the People's Court for sentencing.
　　2. Song Fenglin and Cai Shengfu are each given a demerit.
　　3. Conduct in-depth education in the Security Brigade and the Police Brigade, especially among cadres, to make all personnel more aware of their responsibility to defend the revolution and oppose counter-revolution, to recognize the flesh-and-blood relationship with the working people, to raise class consciousness, to strengthen revolutionary discipline, and to oppose the warlordist tendencies of Yang Ying and others.
　　4. Conduct education among the employees to point out that they are already the leading class in the new society, and that the establishment of revolutionary order in this society is not only necessary and indispensable, but also relies primarily on our working class. Failure to comply with revolutionary order is wrong, and the Security Brigade, Police Brigade, etc., are all our people's armed forces, and beating and surrounding the troops is also wrong. Comrades Kang Ruihua, Zhang Secretary, etc., were correct in remaining calm in the face of events and adhering to their positions.
　　5. Publish this decision in the newspapers and continue to launch a struggle against anarchy and lack of discipline throughout the Party, strengthen discipline, and strengthen the idea of relying on the proletariat.
　　After reading the "Decision of the Shijiazhuang Municipal Committee on the Illegal Encirclement of the Railway Factory and the Arrest and Beating of the Factory's Political Commissar, Secretary, and Workers by Yang Ying, a Staff Officer of the Shijiazhuang Security Brigade, and Others," the North China Bureau of the CPC Central Committee believed that it was completely correct and hereby approved it. In order to educate the entire Party and army, it was decided to publish the course of events and the decision of the Shijiazhuang Municipal Committee on the punishment of Yang Ying and others in the People's Daily.

　　石市保安大队参谋杨瑛
  　殴打职工严重违反纪律
    华北局批准予以留党察看处分
    华北局为教育全党全军  决定公布对杨瑛的处分事实经过
    【本报讯】石家庄市保安大队参谋杨瑛等非法带领武装包围该市铁路大厂、逮捕殴打该厂干部，受到该市中共市委会之严厉处分。今年一月八日，石市铁路大厂个别职工在新新戏院晚间散戏时，因抢先外出，与戏院茶役发生口角，茶役被打。保安三中队二排长在该院值勤，前去制止，要将打架工人带走，工人不允，并将排长打了。铁路大厂张秘书当时也在场，恐生意外，即立刻制止，提出到公安局解决。工人纠察队员二人与该保安排长同到公安局。此时随该排长之值勤队员却跑回三中队部报告，夸大地说：“排长被打死了，被工人带走了。”中队部当即一面报告大队部，一面集合了一个排。因时已夜深，大队部接到报告时，只有参谋杨瑛未睡，杨遂将此事向大队长简单报告，大队长当时未亲自处理，告杨说：“打架的事由公安局解决。你亲自去详细调查一下罢。”此时，到公安局的那个排长与两工人纠察队员，在事未到公安局，而却先到了保安中队，在到达中队部时，正遇已集合的那个排，随来之工人纠察队员二人枪支当被解除。杨瑛及三中队长宋凤林并带领保安队一个排，前往铁路大厂，如临大敌，实行警戒封锁。杨瑛并命令：“如果工人反抗就干！”“张秘书（他曾在戏院调解纠纷）不来，就绑他，如果他要反抗，就打他，打死他，我负责！”三中队长宋凤林带领队员四处寻找，都没有找到张秘书，却找到了大厂政治委员康瑞华同志，说他“组织工人反革命！”将康带至保安大队三中队部拘禁，康政委随来通信员亦被解除武装，并禁止康与外打电话，禁止与同押之工人谈话。此时张秘书正返回厂，当被保安队绑起来，沿路将张打了一顿，带回三中队部，并诬赖张“组织反革命”。职工分会秘书谭毅同志要求随来，以明究竟，也遭拒绝。时已晚上两点钟，经派出所二分局将此事报市公安局，市公安局王应慈局长一面严令立即释放康政委及张秘书，同来市局，一面电令封锁铁路大厂之带队排长蔡生福立即撤消封锁。一月九日三时、张、康及工人纠察队员二人被送到市公安局，市局当场向康、张等同志道歉，将杨瑛、宋凤林等撤职扣押，并于翌日至铁路大厂向全体职工道歉。中共石市市委会获悉此事后，经详细调查与郑重讨论后，认为杨瑛等的此种超出了一般无政府无纪律的极端恶劣的犯罪行为。应受严重处分，但杨在拘押中经多次谈话教育已承认错误，愿意改过，特从轻给以留党察看半年的处分；并建议市政府将该员撤职，送人民法院判处。同时，给中队长宋凤林，排长蔡生福各记大过一次的处分。
    市委决定
    【又讯】中共石家庄市委，对该市保安大队参谋杨瑛等，非法带领武装包围铁路大厂、逮捕殴打大厂干部事件，经过一个月的调查与讨论，于二月二日作出决定，要点如下：
    市委认为：杨瑛等的行为是严重地超出一般无政府、无纪律的极端恶劣的犯罪行为，铁路大厂是国家的工厂，康政委是我党在该厂的代表，张秘书是革命干部，工人纠察队是人民武装，遇到工人与保安队间发生纠纷，杨瑛等不加调查，竟敢假传命令，擅自指挥保安队，将其包围、逮捕、解除武装、辱骂扣押，以致殴打，如同对待反革命一样，这是完全失去共产党员立场的军阀主义行为，是党决不能容忍的罪行。我党在城市中的一切工作，都必须依靠工人阶级，殴打本阶级的群众和革命干部，必然最严重地破坏党与本阶级群众的关系，给革命以无可补偿的损失。为教育全党和杨、宋等本人，市委决定：
    一、杨瑛是此一事件的主要负责者，应受最严重处分。但在拘押中经多次谈话教育，已承认错误，愿意改过。特从轻给以留党察看半年的处分；并建议市政府将该员撤职，送人民法院判处。
    二、给宋凤林及蔡生福各记大过一次的处分。
    三、在保安大队及警察大队中，特别在干部中进行深入的教育，使全体人员更加认清自己保卫革命，反对反革命的职责，认清与劳动人民的血肉关系，提高阶级觉悟，加强革命纪律，反对杨瑛等的军阀主义的倾向。
    四、在职工中进行教育，指出自己已是新社会的领导阶级，这个社会革命秩序的建立不但是必要的，不可少的，而且首先依靠我们工人阶级来建立。不遵守革命秩序是错误的，保安大队、警察大队等都是我们人民的武装，殴打包围部队也是错误的。康政委张秘书等同志遇事镇静，坚持立场，是正确的。
    五、将此决定在报纸上公布，在全党继续展开反无政府无纪律的斗争，加强纪律性，加强依靠无产阶级的思想。
    中共中央华北局看了“石家庄市委关于石家庄保安大队参谋杨瑛等非法包围铁路大厂逮捕殴打该厂政委秘书及工人的决定”后，认为完全正确，特予以批准。为了教育全党全军，并决定将该事件发生的经过和石家庄市委对杨瑛等的处分决定，一并在人民日报上公布。
