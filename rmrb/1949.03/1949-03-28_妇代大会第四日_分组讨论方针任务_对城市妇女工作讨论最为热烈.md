　　Fourth Day of the Women's Congress
  　Group Discussions on Guiding Principles and Tasks
    Most Enthusiastic Discussions on Urban Women's Work
    [Reported by this newspaper] The First National Congress of Chinese Women held its fourth day (March 27th). Each delegation held group meetings to discuss the issue of "The Current Guiding Principles and Tasks of the Chinese Women's Movement." Based on the reports given by Comrade Deng Yingchao and Mr. Li Dequan on the 26th, they discussed mobilizing women in the liberated areas to participate in production and construction, as well as focusing on urban women's work while not neglecting rural women's work. The discussion on urban women's work was the most enthusiastic. Li Xingge, a model for supporting the army from the North China delegation, initially couldn't understand, saying, "The female workers in the cities have just been liberated, how can they lead us?" After discussion, she understood, and said, "The cities now are not what they used to be. Beijing is our Beijing, Tianjin is our Tianjin. To improve national production, relying solely on rural handicrafts is not enough. We must get the machines in the factories running, producing more, and making the country rich so that we can live a good life." The Northeast delegation provided important experiences and methods when discussing the issue of urban female workers' work. Representatives from the Kuomintang-controlled areas focused on discussing the future direction and tasks of women's struggle in the Kuomintang-controlled areas, unanimously resolving to intensify their studies and transform themselves to catch up with the victorious revolutionary situation. Each group also unanimously recognized that the women's movement must be integrated with the entire mass movement. Past experience has proven that conducting women's work in isolation is not feasible. Furthermore, it was believed that any revolutionary movement cannot be completed without women.
    [Another dispatch] Today (March 28th), the congress continued at Huairentang. From 9:00 AM to 12:00 PM, Comrade Cai Chang reported on the international democratic women's movement. From 3:00 PM to 5:00 PM, there was a report on the review of delegate qualifications and a report on the congress's constitution.　　　　　(Ji Qing)

　　妇代大会第四日
  　分组讨论方针任务
    对城市妇女工作讨论最为热烈
    【本报讯】中国妇女第一次全国代表大会第四天（二十七日）、各代表团召开小组会，讨论“中国妇女运动当前的方针与任务”问题，根据廿六日邓颖超同志及李德全先生的报告讨论了发动解放区妇女参加生产建设，以及在不忽视乡村妇女工作条件下应以城市妇女工作为重心等问题。对城市妇女工作问题的讨论最为热烈。华北代表团拥军模范李杏阁，起初想不通，说：“城市女工才解放，她怎么能领导咱们呢？”经过讨论后，她又想通了，她说：“现在的城市不比以前，北平是咱们的北平，天津是咱们的天津。要提高国家生产，仅靠乡下手工业是不成的，必须要工厂的机器轧轧地动起来，出产多，国家富，我们才能过好日子。”东北代表团在讨论了城市女工工作问题时，提供了重要的经验和办法。国统区代表更着重讨论国统区妇女今后奋斗的方针与任务，一致要加紧学习改造自己，赶上革命的胜利形势。各组并一致认识到妇女运动必须和整个群众运动结合起来，过去的经验证明，孤立地进行妇女工作，是行不通的。并且认为任何革命运动离开妇女也是不能完成的。
    【又讯】今日（二十八日）大会继续在怀仁堂进行，上午九时至十二时由蔡畅同志报告国际民主妇女运动。下午三时至五时代表资格审查报告，及大会章程报告。　　　　　（纪青）
