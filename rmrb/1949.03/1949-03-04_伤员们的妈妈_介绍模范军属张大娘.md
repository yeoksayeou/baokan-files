The Wounded Soldiers' Mother
——Introducing Model Military Family Member Zhang Da Niang
	Zhang Jingchun Da Niang from Xujiayu, Fifth District of Pinggu, is respectfully called "Mom" by more than 600 wounded soldiers in the × Unit Hospital. Zhang Da Niang is 55 years old this year, with her old husband, two sons, and two daughters at home. In the past, life was very difficult for her family. They didn't own a single room or a single piece of land. They lived in tears, constantly lacking food and clothing. Her husband went to the Tangshan coal mine to work as a laborer when he came of age. Her eldest son worked for the landlord from a young age. Her youngest son was sent to a temple as a monk at the age of three, and her two daughters were given away as child brides. She worked as a servant for a wealthy family. Poverty forced her whole family to be scattered. In the 32nd year of the Republic of China, the heartless landlord嫌弃ed her for being old and didn't want her anymore. The daughter who had been given away as a child bride and the son who had become a monk were also returned. She had no choice but to lead her children to beg for food in the wind and snow. She lived through these sorrowful days. In the 35th year of the Republic of China, the Communist Party implemented land reform, and the poor were given houses and land. Only then did Zhang Da Niang stand up. She often said, "Don't forget the well-diggers when you drink water, and never forget Chairman Mao!" After turning over, she sent her eldest son to join the army. She was elected as the director of the Women's Association in the village and was actively responsible for her work, especially in supporting the army, setting a good example for the whole village. On November 12th last year, the × Unit Field Hospital came to this village. Zhang Da Niang loved the wounded soldiers as if they were her own children. When the wounded soldiers first arrived, she served them for ten days and ten nights without rest. That day, it was late at night when she went back to sleep, so tired that several blisters had formed on her feet, but she never complained about the trouble or said she was tired. From this ward to that ward, she helped the seriously wounded with their bowel movements, urine, wiping pus, wiping blood, catching lice, washing wounds, feeding water, and feeding food. Every time, she would test the temperature herself before feeding it to the wounded soldiers' mouths. One night, almost at the crack of dawn, the weather was very cold and dark. She had just lied down to sleep when she heard a seriously wounded soldier living in Chen Zhiyou's house asking for water. She quickly got up and boiled two pots of boiling water, personally brought it over, and fed it to him sip by sip. The wounded soldier was so moved that he shed tears and said, "You are even closer than my own mother!" She was afraid that the wounded soldiers would be homesick, so she always comforted them gently whenever she went to any ward. The wounded soldiers were always happy to see her and reluctant to let her leave. Zhang Da Niang often brought fresh food from her home to the wounded soldiers or invited them to her home to eat. On the sixteenth day of the twelfth lunar month, her family slaughtered a small pig to prepare for the New Year. She divided the cooked pig trotters and fatty cheeks, etc., and sent them to the wounded soldiers to eat. On the twenty-eighth day of the twelfth lunar month, she invited five wounded soldiers to her home for dumplings. The three bags of peanuts in her house were not sold, but were given to the wounded soldiers to eat little by little. She always lived frugally and was reluctant to spend money, but she didn't feel bad at all about spending money to buy things for the wounded soldiers to eat. She was afraid that the wounded soldiers' mouths would be tasteless, so she twice took out money to buy candied haws and hawthorn cakes for the wounded soldiers to eat. One day, two wounded soldiers wanted to eat black bean noodles, and she immediately took out half a liter of black beans to the flour mill to exchange for black bean flour.
	Her home is just like the home of the wounded soldiers. She and her two daughters sew and wash clothes for the wounded soldiers every day. Just in the middle of the twelfth lunar month last year, the mother and daughters拆洗ed more than forty pieces of bloody clothing for the wounded soldiers, knitted more than thirty pairs of socks, made more than one hundred collar covers, more than twenty quilt covers, and also six hats and five pairs of shoes. On the night of the thirtieth day of the twelfth lunar month, she even made a pair of cotton trousers for a wounded soldier and mended three pairs of socks. Zhang Da Niang said to the villagers, "If it weren't for the Communist Party who saved me, if it weren't for them (referring to the wounded soldiers) fighting, getting injured, and bleeding, I would still have to beg for food; my family would never be reunited."
	Because of her concern and care for the wounded soldiers, more than 600 wounded soldiers in the two recuperation centers affectionately called her "Mom"! During the lunar New Year, she unfortunately fell ill from exhaustion. All the working convalescents sent representatives to visit her, bringing snacks, noodles, persimmons, and pears. The doctor in the hospital heard that she was sick and came to treat her without even eating. On the first day of the New Year, all the comrades from top to bottom in the hospital came to pay New Year's greetings to Zhang Da Niang. This year, in the first month, a group of wounded soldiers who had recovered and were discharged from the hospital were returning to the front line. Before leaving, they bid farewell to her and said, "This time, when we return to the front line, we will definitely kill the enemy and perform meritorious service to repay you!"
	Zhang Da Niang is not only a model of caring for the wounded soldiers, but also a labor model. The work at home has never used village代耕. The thirteen mu of land that was distributed were all cultivated and hoeed by her and her daughter. In her spare time, she and her two daughters and youngest son spun thread. The four spinning wheels spun an average of one and a half catties a day. In the year before last alone, they spun more than 140 catties of thread. Last summer, they made and sold more than forty pairs of large shoe soles. Her name has spread throughout Pinggu County, and no one doesn't know her when she is mentioned. She has received the respect and love of the broad masses of people. At this county-wide women's representative conference, she was elected as a representative to attend the Eastern Women's Representative Conference and as an executive member of the County Women's Federation.

　　伤员们的妈妈
  ——介绍模范军属张大娘
    平谷五区许家坞的张景春大娘，×部医院六百多个伤员都尊敬地管她叫：“妈”。张大娘今年五十五岁，家里老两口子，两个儿子和两个闺女，过去家里的日子很难过，房无一间地无一垄。整天缺吃少穿的在泪水中生活。男人成年去唐山下煤窑，卖苦力，大儿子从小就给地主扛活，小儿子刚三岁就送给庙里当和尚，两个闺女童养出去，她给财主家当老妈；穷苦的日子逼得他全家骨肉离散。到了民国卅二年狠心的地主嫌她年老不要她了，童养出去的闺女和当和尚的儿子也都被退回来，她只得领着几个孩子在风雪里去要饭吃；她这愁死愁活的日子就这样熬着过。到了民国三十五年，共产党实行土地改革，穷人分了房子分了地，张大娘这才翻了身。她常说：“吃水可别忘挖井的，万古千秋不能忘毛主席！”翻身后便送她大儿子参了军，她在村当选为妇女会主任，对工作积极负责，尤其在拥军工作上，作了全村的好榜样。去年十一月十二日，×部野战医院来到这村中，张大娘象爱自己儿女一样热爱伤员，当伤员刚来时她整整伺候了十天十夜没休息，那天全是三星大偏西才回去睡觉，累的她两只脚磨出好几个大泡，可是她从来也没有嫌过麻烦说过累，从这个病房到那个病房，给重伤员接屎、接尿、擦脓、擦血、拿虱子、洗伤口喂水喂饭，每次都是自己先试试凉热再送到伤员的嘴里。有一天夜里快鸡叫了，天气很冷漆黑天，她刚躺下要睡，就听见住在陈治友里家的重伤员要水喝，她赶紧起来烧了两壶开水，亲身送去一口一口的喂下去，感动的那个伤员落了泪说：“你真比我妈还亲！”她怕伤员们痛苦想家，不论到哪一家病房时都是婉言安慰，伤员见了她都是欢天喜地的舍不得她走。张大娘经常把她家里的新鲜食物给伤员送去或请来家吃。在腊月十六那天，家里杀了一口准备过年的小肥猪，她把煮好的猪蹄、肥脸等，分送给伤员吃，腊月二十八又请五个伤员到家里吃饺子。她家里的三口袋花生一点没卖，都是零碎给伤员们吃了。她从来省吃俭用舍不得花钱，可是给伤员们花钱买东西吃却一点也不心疼。她怕伤员嘴里吃东西没味，自己曾两次掏出钱来给伤员买糖葫芦和熬山渣糕吃。一天有两个伤员想吃黑粉，她马上拿出半升黑豆到粉房去换黑粉。
    她的家就好象伤员的家，她和两个闺女天天给伤员们缝洗，就在去年腊月当中，母女三人就给伤员拆洗了四十多件血衣服，织袜子三十多双，作领套一百多条，被套二十多床，还有帽子六顶，鞋子五双，腊月三十的晚上她还给伤员作了一条棉裤，补了三双袜子。张大娘对庄里人说：“要不是共产党救我，要不是他们（指伤员）打仗，挂花流血，我还得要饭吃；一家永远也团圆不了。”
    由于她对待伤员这样的关心爱护，感动的两个休养所六百多个伤员都亲切的管她叫“妈妈”！在旧历年根她不幸累病了，全体的工作休养员，都派来代表看望，送来点心，挂面、柿子和梨；所里的医生听说她病了，连饭都没吃赶来治病；大年初一的那天全所上下的同志们都给张大娘来拜年。今年正月有一部养好的伤员出院回前线，临走向她告别说：“这次回前线一定杀敌立功来报答你！”
    张大娘不但是爱护伤员的模范，还是一个劳动模范，家里的活计从来没用过村中代耕。分得十三亩地都是她和闺女耕种锄榜，闲时候就和两个闺女和小儿子纺线；四辆纺车平均每天纺一斤半，只前年一年就纺了一百四十多斤线，去年夏天钉大鞋底子卖了四十多双。她的名字传遍了平谷县，提起她来没有不知道的。他已受到了广大群众的尊敬与爱戴，这次在全县妇女代表大会上，被选为出席东妇代大会的代表和县妇联执行委员。
