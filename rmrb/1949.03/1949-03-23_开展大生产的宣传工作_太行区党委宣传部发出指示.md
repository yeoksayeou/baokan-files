　　Carrying out Propaganda for the Great Production Campaign
    Taihang District Party Committee Propaganda Department Issues Instructions

    [Taihang Electric Dispatch] In order to carry out the great production movement, the Propaganda Department of the Taihang District Committee of the Communist Party of China issued instructions on propaganda and mobilization work on the 6th of this month, requesting the propaganda departments of the party at all levels to promptly develop plans for propaganda and mobilization for the great production movement and deploy them downwards. The instructions stated: This year's propaganda and mobilization work should determine the content and methods of propaganda based on different regions, different targets, different stages of the movement, and the degree of awareness of the masses. The past phenomena of uniformity, simplicity, and even inappropriate propaganda of the socialist and communist production prospects among the masses in some places, which caused unnecessary ideological confusion among the masses, must be corrected. All cadres must be educated to learn how to do propaganda work.

    The primary task at present is to immediately involve party members, cadres, and the masses in the great production movement. To this end, on the basis of ending land reform, it is necessary to focus on publicizing the guiding principle and task of "one inch of production growth" and the significance of completing land reform for the masses to become rich and support the war and build the country. Publicize the party and government's various policies on rewarding the development of production after the land reform (such as issuing land certificates, determining land rights, allowing hiring labor, lending money, and free trading of land), and current laws and regulations (such as the North China People's Government's new agricultural tax regulations and loan measures) to break the masses' concerns and improve their enthusiasm for production. Among party members and cadres, it should be emphasized that the party's basic task after land reform is to lead the people to develop production and build the country. The laissez-faire thinking of cadres who do not pay attention to leading production must be corrected. Every cadre must understand that liberating productive forces is the most basic task of the revolution. Secondly, on the basis of the masses' active production, we should first focus on publicizing the benefits of organizing and the voluntary and mutually beneficial policies of mutual assistance to improve the masses' understanding of organizing; absorb the masses to organize and develop production from the education of production prospects and actual interests, gradually improve the masses' awareness, and gradually expand mutual aid organizations. But this is not to say that we should clearly divide the stages and not connect them.

    The current propaganda and mobilization must focus on the following two links: First, combine the issuance of land certificates to universally hold grand celebrations to mark the end of the land reform and carry out great production mobilization. This is the best form of land reform turning to production. If attention can be paid to its use, it will have a great effect. In the past, some areas treated the issuance of land certificates only as a simple technical task, which was wrong. Second, carrying out centralized propaganda and mobilization through the upcoming regular meetings in various places also has a great effect. Propaganda work should be organized for all old temple fairs. As for systematic education, it should be carried out regularly in conjunction with current affairs education and branch teaching materials in branch party members and various mass organizations (literacy classes, mutual aid groups, etc.).

    The propaganda and mobilization of this year's great production movement must create a craze and form a mass movement. The slogan "one inch of production growth" must be deeply rooted in the hearts of the people and known to every household. All propaganda tools (mass blackboards, radio stations, slides, foreign films, etc.) must be used to mobilize and organize various propaganda forces (theater troupes, ballad teams, schools, community education centers in market towns, rural clubs, etc.) to adopt various propaganda methods (written, oral, artistic, etc.) to repeatedly carry out propaganda, so as to make the center clear and prominent and make it easy for the masses to accept. Otherwise, the completion of the "one inch of production growth" task will be greatly affected. In order to carry out propaganda and mobilization for the great production movement, creative activities should still be launched in various places. The Taihang Writers Association will soon issue a "call for submissions," and various places should respond in an organized manner.

　　开展大生产的宣传工作
    太行区党委宣传部发出指示
    【太行电】为了开展大生产运动，中共太行区党委宣传部于本月六日发出宣传动员工作指示，要求各级党的宣传部及时作出开展大生产运动宣传动员的计划，布置下去。指示称：今年的宣传动员工作，要根据不同地区，不同对象，运动的不同阶段，以及群众的觉悟程度，决定宣传内容与方式。过去那种千篇一律、简单了事，甚至有些地方在群众中不适当地宣传社会主义、共产主义的生产前途，引起群众不必要的思想混乱等现象，必须纠正，要教育全体干部学会做宣传工作。
    目前首要的任务是使党员、干部、群众都立即卷入大生产运动。为此，必须在结束土改的基础上，在群众中，着重宣传“生产长一寸”的方针任务与土改完成对群众发家致富，对支援战争、建设国家的意义。宣传党和政府在土改后关于奖励发展生产的各项政策（如发土地证、确定地权、允许雇工、放帐，自由买卖土地等），和现行法令（如华北人民政府的新农业税则、贷款办法等），以此打破群众顾虑，提高群众的生产积极性。在党员和干部中则应着重说明：土改后党的基本任务，就是领导人民发展生产建设国家。纠正干部不重视领导生产的自流思想，必须使每个干部都懂得：解放生产力，是革命最基本的任务。其次，在群众积极生产的基础上，首先着重宣传组织起来的好处与互助的自愿两利政策，提高群众对组织起来的认识；从生产前途的教育与实际利益中，进一步吸收群众组织起来发展生产，逐步提高群众觉悟，逐步扩大互助组织。但这也不是说，要截然划分阶段，互不连贯。
    当前的宣传动员必须抓紧以下两个环节来进行：一、结合发土地证普遍地召开隆重的庆祝结束土改大会，进行大生产动员，这是土改转向生产的一种最好的形式，如能注意运用，必有很大效果。过去有些地区把颁发土地证只作为一种简单的技术工作是不对的。二、通过各地即将到来的例会，进行集中的宣传动员，亦有很大的作用。凡旧有庙会都应组织宣传工作。至于系统教育，则应经常结合时事教育和支部教材，在支部党员和群众的各种组织（识字班、互助组等）中去进行。
    今年大生产运动的宣传动员，必须造成热潮，形成群众性的运动。“生产长一寸”的口号，必须深入人心，做到家喻户晓。必须利用一切宣传工具（大众黑板、广播台、幻灯、洋片等），动员和组织各种宣传力量（剧团、鼓书队、学校、集镇民教馆、农村俱乐部等），采取多种多样的宣传方式（文字的、口头的、文艺的等），来反复进行宣传，务使中心明确突出，使群众易于接受。否则“生产长一寸”任务的完成，就要受到很大影响。为了开展大生产运动的宣传动员，各地仍应发动创作运动。太行文协即将发出“征稿启事”，各地应有组织地响应。
