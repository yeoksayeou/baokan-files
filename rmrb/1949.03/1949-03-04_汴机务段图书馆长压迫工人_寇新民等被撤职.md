Xinhua News Agency, Kaifeng, 26th. Kou Xinmin and Xu Wenxue, the head and deputy head of the library of the Kaifeng Locomotive Depot of the Longhai Railway, took advantage of their positions to oppress and numb workers, arousing public outrage among all the workers of the depot, and have been dismissed from their posts. The establishment of the Kaifeng Locomotive Depot Library was originally intended to provide cultural education for all the workers of the depot, but Kou Xinmin and Xu Wenxue used the library to divide the workers' solidarity and oppress the workers. More than 20 employees were placed in a small library, most of whom were Kou and Xu's cronies. The funds for purchasing books and newspapers for the library were deducted from the workers' wages, but the workers could not even see newspapers at ordinary times. Most of the books purchased were erotic novels with obscene content, in an attempt to numb the will of the working masses. Wang Chengzhang, the coordinator of the locomotive depot, once suggested to Xu Wenxue that more revolutionary books should be bought for the workers to read in order to help the workers progress. Xu not only did not humbly accept the suggestion, but also treated him maliciously; and convened a library meeting to threaten Wang Chengzhang, saying: "We don't know how to run a library, let the coordinator tell us what to do!" When Wang Chengzhang reflected to Xu Wenxue that the workers were dissatisfied with deducting book purchase fees from their wages, Xu Wenxue hurriedly took out his notebook and asked aggressively: "Who said it, who said it?" to intimidate him. Xu Wenxue maliciously slandered Liu Hengxin, a technical worker from the Kaifeng Municipal Trade Union representative locomotive depot, saying that he was a troublemaker, and publicly attacked him at the meeting. Xu also adopted a hostile attitude towards other progressive workers. In addition, Kou and Xu usually squandered the public funds of the library paid by the workers with their blood and sweat, eating and drinking lavishly, and living extravagantly. Although the above-mentioned bad behavior was exposed and criticized by the Kaifeng Daily, Kou and Xu did not repent in the slightest. More than 400 workers in the entire section held a meeting on the 14th of this month to criticize Kou Xinmin and Xu Wenxue. Because they were unable to defend themselves, they had to admit their mistakes to the workers. Song Zhaoxun, the special commissioner of the Kaifeng Military Control Commission stationed in the Longhai Railway, in order to enforce work discipline and follow the public opinion of the workers, announced on the spot the removal of Kou Xinmin and Xu Wenxue from their positions in the library.

　　汴机务段图书馆长压迫工人
  　寇新民等被撤职
    【新华社开封二十六日电】陇海铁路开封机务段图书馆正副馆长寇新民、许文学，利用职务便利，压迫和麻痹工人，激起全段工人的公愤，业已受到撤职处分。开封机务段图书馆的设立，原是为了对于全段工人进行文化教育，寇新民、许文学却利用图书馆来进行分化工人团结和压迫工人的活动。一个小型图书馆内，安置了二十多个职员，多数是寇、许两人的亲信。图书馆购置书报的费用，系从工人工资中扣除得来，但工人平时连报纸都看不到，所买书籍大部分都是内容猥亵的言情小说，企图借此麻痹工人群众的意志。机务段协理员王成章曾向许文学建议应多买革命的书籍给工人阅读，以帮助工人进步，许不但不虚心接受，反而恶毒相向；并召开图书馆会议，威胁王成章说：“我们不会办图书馆，让协理员指示我们怎么办吧！”当王成章向许文学反映工人不满意从工资中扣除买书费时，许文学急忙掏出笔记本，气势汹汹的问：“哪个说的，哪个说的？”以事恫吓。许文学对于开封市职工会代表机务段的技术工人刘恒信、恶意诋诲，说他是捣乱分子，公开在会上打击他。对于其他进步工人，许亦采取仇视态度。此外，寇、许两人，平时又任意挥霍工人以血汗缴纳的图书馆的公费，大吃大喝，生活奢侈。以上种种恶劣行为。虽经开封日报予以揭露批评，寇、许两人仍不稍悔改。全段四百多工人乃于本月十四日召开会议，对于寇新民、许文学进行批评，他们因为理屈词穷，不得不向工人承认错误。开封市军事管制委员会派驻陇海铁路特派员宋兆勋，为执行工作纪律，顺从工人公意，当场宣布了撤销寇新民、许文学在图书馆的职务。
