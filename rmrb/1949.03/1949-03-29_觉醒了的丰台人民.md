[Ping Shi News] After the liberation of Fengtai, the political consciousness of the masses has been raised through education and mobilization. In recent times, many activists have emerged. Their class vigilance and political sense of responsibility have been heightened, and they are actively assisting the People's Government in construction in all aspects. Zhang Deming, the leader of a small vendor group, noticed a suspicious person in his courtyard who had not registered his household for three days and had blocked all the windows of his house. After discovering this, he immediately notified the head of the residents' group, asking him to report the household registration; but there was no response because this group leader was a former old head of the Baojia system. Coincidentally, comrades from the work team came to Zhang Deming, and he immediately reported the matter again. After investigation, this person turned out to be a special agent named Feng from the pseudo-garrison headquarters.

A few bad people came to the courtyard of group member Lu Jincheng to gamble, and he immediately ran to warn them: "This is not the Kuomintang era! The People's Liberation Army does not allow gambling! You cannot gamble in this courtyard, otherwise I will report it!" Those people then dared not gamble.

On the morning of March 15, a worker named Feng Guozhong voluntarily brought three money scalpers who were disrupting the financial market to the work team. He told the working comrades of the People's Government: "I know that we ordinary people do not have the right to arrest people, but only the obligation to report to the government. But I was afraid they would run away, so I had to trick them by saying I wanted to exchange money. You can ask them carefully, check them out, see what problems they have, educate them well, and then let them go. Tell them that what they are doing is contrary to government decrees and is detrimental to the common people." He gave these instructions before leaving.

Recently, several theft cases have occurred in Fengtai. After the activists learned about it, they automatically reported to the Public Security Bureau and exposed several idlers who specialize in stealing for a living. The public security in Fengtai has gradually become more stable.

At the beginning of the Great Production Movement launched by the Fengtai District Committee, the masses had a simple idea of relying solely on loans for relief. The work team first convened small production symposiums for activists to correct this idea; then, with them as the backbone, they led various groups to hold discussion meetings to prepare for the organization of production mutual aid. Group leader Feng Guozhong said to everyone: "Relying solely on the government to provide us with food is not a long-term solution. If we want to live well, we must organize ourselves to help each other, discuss, offer ideas, and solve difficulties together in order to solve the problem and truly stand up."

In this way, the farmers of Fengtai began to actively engage in spring plowing. The small vendors also organized themselves, pooled funds to discuss, and tried their best to use existing furniture to plan how to open a tofu shop, how to run a vegetable shop, and how to help each other. They firmly believe that as long as they are not afraid of difficulties and discuss everything together, production will surely improve.

　　觉醒了的丰台人民
    邓林　袁献亭　嘉尔
    【平市讯】丰台解放后，群众经过教育与发动，政治觉悟提高。在最近一段期间，已出现了不少积极份子，他们的阶级警惕性与政治责任心提高了，正积极从各方面协助人民政府进行建设。有一个小商贩小组的组长叫张德明的，院中来了一个人，鬼鬼祟祟，三天没有报户口，而且把住房的窗户全堵上了。他发觉后，立即通知居民小组长，叫他报户口；但没有反应，因为这个小组长是个旧甲长。赶巧工作组的同志去找张德明，他立刻又反映了这件事。经过查询，这个人原来就是伪警卫处一个姓冯的特务长。
    组员卢金城院中来了几个坏人打牌，他立刻就跑去警告他们：“这不是国民党时代了！人民解放军是不许赌博的！你们不能在这院里打，不然我就要报告去！”那些人就不敢打牌了。
    三月十五日的早晨，有一个工人叫冯国忠，自动的送到工作组来三个扰乱金融市场的钱贩子。他告诉人民政府的工作同志们说：“我知道我们老百姓没有捕人的权利，只有向政府报告的义务。可是我又怕他跑了，只好骗他说我要换钱。你们可以好好的问问他，检查他一下，看他有些什么问题没有，好好的教育他一下再放他。告诉他说他们干的这行子是与政府法令相反，对于老百姓是不利的。”他这样叮咛了一番才回去了。
    最近丰台连续出了几件偷窃案，积极分子知道后，自动的报告到公安局，检举了几个不务正业，专门偷人为生的小偷，丰台的治安就逐渐安定多了。
    丰台区委发动大生产运动之始，群众存在一种单纯依靠贷款救济的想法；工作组便先召集积极分子开小型生产座谈会，纠正这种想法；然后又以他们为骨干去领导各小组召开讨论会，酝酿组织生产互助。小组长冯国忠向大家说：“光依靠政府救济我们粮食，这不是一种长期办法；我们要生活得好，必须自己组织起来互相帮助，商讨，出主意，互相解决困难，才能解决问题，才能真正翻身。”
    这样，丰台的农民们开始积极从事春耕；小摊贩们也组织起来，大家集资讨论，尽量利用原有家具，计划怎样开个豆腐房，怎样搞个青菜铺，怎样大家互相帮助。他们坚信，只要不怕困难，事事大家商讨，生产一定会搞好。
