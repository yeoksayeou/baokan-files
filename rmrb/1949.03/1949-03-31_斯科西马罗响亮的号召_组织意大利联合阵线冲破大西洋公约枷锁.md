　　Xinhua News Agency, Beiping, 29th: Reports from various sources: The Italian Senate's fierce debate on the North Atlantic Pact, after lasting for fifty hours, concluded on the evening of the 27th.
    Before the end of the debate, Scoccimarro, leader of the Communist Party faction in the Senate, delivered a lengthy speech. He first analyzed the content of the North Atlantic Pact, saying: The preamble to this pact mentioned the desire to "live in peace with all peoples and all governments." But if this is really the case, why has the United States twice refused to discuss the Soviet Union's peace proposals? Why did Norway reject the Soviet proposal to conclude a mutual non-aggression treaty? Article 1 of the pact states that the contracting parties will "refrain in their international relations from the threat or use of force, in any manner inconsistent with the Purposes of the United Nations." But if this is really the case, why are the contracting parties using force against the people of Vietnam, Indonesia, Malaya, and Greece? Does the establishment of military bases in Europe not mean the threat of the use of force? Scoccimarro emphasized: Article 3 of the pact obliges the contracting parties to grant military bases to the armed forces of the United States. Article 4 allows the United States to interfere in the internal affairs of countries participating in the North Atlantic Pact. According to Article 5 of the pact, Italian territory will become a military springboard and air and naval base for the United States, and will inevitably become a dependency. Scoccimarro then declared to the government: "We call on all Italians, all political parties, and all classes to unite in a great united front to shatter the shackles that you want to use to bind the Italian people. We know that you will do everything possible to oppose us, and the spearhead of your pact first threatens us. The more barbaric your persecution of us according to the orders of your masters, the more resolute our actions will be! (Opposition senators burst into stormy cheers.) You sign this pact that divides the country, and you will be cursed by the people. This will mark the beginning of a new stage of enslavement of Italy, and at the same time, the beginning of a new stage of the liberation movement."

　　斯科西马罗响亮的号召
    组织意大利联合阵线冲破大西洋公约枷锁
    【新华社北平二十九日电】各方报道：意大利参议院关于北大西洋公约的激烈辩论，在持续五十小时之后，已于二十七日晚结束。
    参院共产党党团领袖斯科西马罗在结束辩论之前发表长篇演说。他首先分析北大西洋公约的内容说：这个公约的序言曾谈到和“一切民族与一切政府和平相处”的愿望。但如果真是这样，美国为什么两次拒绝讨论苏联的和平建议呢？为什么挪威拒绝苏联所提缔结互不侵犯条约的建议呢？公约的第一条有云：缔约国将“避免采用与联合国目标不符之威胁或武力”。但如果真是这样，缔约国为什么对越南、印尼、马来亚和希腊的人民施用武力呢？在欧洲建立军事基地，难道不意味着施用武力的威胁吗？斯科西马罗强调指出：公约的第三条责成缔约国以军事基地给予美国的武装部队。第四条则使美国得以干涉参加北大西洋公约国家的内政。依照公约的第五条，意国的领土将变成美国军事跳板和海空军基地，从而不可避免地将变成附庸国。斯科西马罗继而向政府方面宣称：“我们号召一切意大利人，一切政党和一切阶级团结成伟大的联合阵线将粉碎你们想用来束缚意大利人民的枷锁。我们知道，你们将尽一切努力反对我们，你们的公约的矛头，首先威胁着我们。你们遵从你们主子的命令对我们的迫害愈野蛮，我们的行动就会愈坚决！（反对党参议员发出暴风雨似的欢呼。）你们在这一分裂国家的公约上签字，你们将遭到人民的咒骂。这一点，将表示奴役意大利的新阶段的开始，同时也是解放运动的新阶段的开始。”
