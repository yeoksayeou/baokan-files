Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, March 5th: The Tanggu Alkali Plant, belonging to the nationally renowned private Yongli Chemical Company, has begun to resume production under the protection and support of the People's Government. This plant is the only factory in the country using the Solvay process for alkali production, with excellent equipment and over a thousand employees. Its main product is soda ash (sodium carbonate), and the by-product is caustic soda, both of which are important industrial materials. The company's main raw material is Changlu salt. Before liberation, the Kuomintang bandit gang transported large quantities of Changlu salt to Japan, greatly affecting its production and business. In addition, the sharp drop in enemy currency value led to even greater losses, resulting in a temporary shutdown. During the Battle of Tanggu, the Kuomintang bandit army also extensively damaged the plant, forcibly occupying part of the factory buildings as positions and destroying most of the facilities. More than 200,000 hemp sacks and over 100,000 cubic feet of wood were looted to build bunkers. Fortunately, thanks to the protection of the People's Liberation Army, its main equipment was preserved. After liberation, the People's Government, to help the plant solve the difficulties in resuming work, allocated thirteen train carriages to transport its inventory to the Ping, Tianjin, and Tangshan areas for sale. Now that the plant has resumed operation, the daily output of Double A soda ash has reached one-third of the previous normal daily output of 125 tons, and the first batch of 16 tons of the by-product, caustic soda, has been produced. The resumption of production is continuing.

  　塘沽硷厂恢复生产
    【新华社天津五日电】全国著名的私营永利化学公司所属的塘沽制硷厂，在人民政府保护与扶植之下，已开始恢复生产。该厂为全国唯一用苏尔维法制硷的工厂，设备甚佳，职工达千余人。其出品主要为纯硷（炭酸钠），副产品为烧硷，均为重要工业用品。该公司所需主要原料，系采用长芦盐。解放前，国民党匪帮将长芦盐大量输日，致使其生产营业大受影响，加以敌币值猛跌，赔累更巨，以是曾一度停工。塘大战争中，国民党匪军又大肆破坏该厂，厂房一部被强占为阵地，模样大部被毁，二十余万条麻袋和十余万立方尺木材均被抢去修筑碉堡。幸赖人民解放军之保护，其主要设备得以保全。解放后，人民政府为助该厂解决复工中的困难，曾先后拨给车皮十三辆使其运存货至平、津、唐山一带销售。现该厂复工后，每日所出的双甲硷达已往正常的日产量一百二十五吨的三分之一，副产品烧硷第一锅已出十六吨。现仍继续恢复生产中。
