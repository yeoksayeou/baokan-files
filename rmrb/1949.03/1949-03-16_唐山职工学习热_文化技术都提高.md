　　Tangshan Workers' Study Craze:
　　Culture and Technology Both Improved
　　[Tangshan Electric] An unprecedented upsurge of learning is sweeping through factories and mines in Tangshan. Workers have spontaneously formed study groups and study committees, established libraries and reading rooms, and are carrying out political, cultural, and technical studies during their spare time. The workers' preparatory committee is also providing assistance in many ways. The first term of the Kailuan Tangshan Mine Workers' Half-Day School concluded on the 18th of last month, and the second term began on the 22nd. Each term has about two hundred students. The study period is set at half a month per term. The teaching materials are divided into three types: current affairs, labor movement, and party building. The current affairs course includes the "New Year's Message" and "Chairman Mao's Statement on the Current Situation," etc. The labor movement course includes the Labor Congress resolution, the "February 7th" editorial, etc. The party building course covers the Communist Party Constitution, etc. The school affairs committee is organized by comrades from the workers' preparatory committee to provide planned leadership. The Zhaoge Zhuang Mine organized a workers' literacy class. One hundred and forty workers from the mine's third division are divided into twenty-seven groups, divided into six o'clock, two o'clock, and ten o'clock shifts according to work hours, and study for two hours every day. The underground mining technicians of the five major factories organized a "Mining Technology Research Class" to specifically study and research mining technology. They are divided into intermediate and beginner groups according to their level. The intermediate level focuses on the study of scientific principles, and technicians from various factories are invited to give lectures, studying once a day, with extremely high enthusiasm. The Linxi and Tangjiazhuang mines have also established workers' evening schools. The workers in Linxi have also created a public reading room, purchasing more than two hundred kinds of new books. The railway machinery factory workers have a higher cultural level. Their study class brings together more than one hundred workers from various stations and sections to collectively discuss the current situation and factory management, which has achieved great results. Their previously opened spare-time school has also recently resumed, with classes held for two hours every night from five to seven o'clock, divided into three classes: management class first year, technology class first year, and technology class second year. The study period is two years. The technical class courses are divided into drawing, engineering materials, engineering drawing, and political common sense. The management class is divided into official document formats, bookkeeping mathematics, and factory overview. They also established study committees with each station section and the various departments of the South Factory Repair Shop as independent units, conducting studies separately. The Railway Bureau recently purchased more than two thousand books from Shenyang and distributed them evenly to various units. In addition, workers from the Telecommunications Bureau, the Military Control Hebei Electric Power Tangshan Branch, Qixin, and Huaxin all have similar study organizations and libraries. A worker in the Telecommunications Bureau who was illiterate was determined to recognize four to six new characters every day and proposed to ensure that he could do three things: read, write, and speak. The Hebei Workers' School, sponsored by the Jidong Administrative Office, recruited in Tangshan. Workers from various mines and factories competed to go, but because they could not leave their work, each factory had to put forward only a few people to apply. A total of seven hundred and twenty-five people applied. The exam was held on the 1st, and the results were released on the 7th, with five hundred and thirty-seven people admitted. The school is now scheduled to open on the 10th in Linxi, and workers from various mines and factories warmly welcome the admitted students to enroll.

　　唐山职工学习热
  　文化技术都提高
    【唐山电】唐山各厂矿职工掀起空前高涨的学习热潮。职工们先后自动成立了学习小组和学习委员会，主办图书馆和阅览室，开展工余的政治、文化和技术学习。职工筹委会也在多方面予以协助。开滦唐山矿职工半日学校第一期已在上月十八日结业，第二期又于二十二日开课，每期都有二百名上下学员。学习期限，定为半月一期。教材分时事课、工运课、党建课三种。时事课包括“新年献词”和“毛主席对时局声明”等。工运课包括劳大决议、“二七”社论等。党建课则为共产党党章等。由职工筹委会同志组织校务委员会，作有计划的领导。赵各庄矿组织了工人识字班，矿井三分处一百四十名工友，编成二十七个小组，依工作时间分六点班、两点班、十点班三班，每日学习两小时。五大厂的井下采矿技术人员，组织了一个“采矿技术研究班”，专门学习和研究采矿技术。按程度高低分为中、初两组。中级着重科学原理的学习，聘请各厂技师讲课，每天学习一次，情绪极高。林西和唐家庄两矿也设立了职工补习学校。林西的职工们还创办了一个大众阅览室，购有新书二百多种。铁路机厂职工文化水准较高，他们学习班集中了各站段职工百余人，集体讨论目前形势和工厂管理，收到很大效果。他们过去开办的工余学校，亦于近日恢复，每晚自五点到七点上课两小时，分管理班一年级、技术班一年级、技术班二年级等三班。修业期为两年。技术班课程分制图、工程材料、工程画、政治常识等。管理班分公文程式、簿记数学、工厂概况等。他们还以各站段及南厂修理厂各系所为独立单位，成立学习委员会，分别进行学习。路局最近已从沈阳购来书籍二千多册，平均分配给各单位。此外如电讯局、军管冀北电力唐山分公司、启新、华新职工们，都有同样的学习组织和图书馆。电讯局有位工友不识字，下决心每天认四个至六个生字，并提出一定做到三会：会念、会写、会讲。冀东行署主办的冀东职工学校在唐山招考，各矿厂职工人员争着要去，但因工作离不开，每个厂都只得推出少数人去投考。计投考七百二十五名。一日举行考试，七日放榜，录取五百三十七名。现该校定十日在林西开学，各矿厂职工都以热烈的心情欢迎录取的学员们入学。
