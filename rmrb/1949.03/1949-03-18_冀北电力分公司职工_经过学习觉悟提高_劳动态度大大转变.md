　　Hebei Electricity Branch Employees Improve Awareness Through Study, Significantly Changing Work Attitude

　　[This newspaper reports] The employees of the Beiping branch of the Hebei Electricity Company, after a month of study, have gradually established a new work attitude, sweeping away the perfunctory and procrastinating style of the Kuomintang rule in the past, treating work as their own business, and earnestly and conscientiously taking on their due responsibilities. During the rule of the Kuomintang reactionaries, when the power plant transported fuel coal from Tangshan to Shijingshan, it was always lost, with an average loss of about 6%. Now, however, whatever is bought is transported, with almost no loss at all. During the siege of Beiping by the People's Liberation Army, 800 electric poles and 40 tons of electric wire on the outskirts were destroyed by the Kuomintang army, and most of them were used for fortifications. After the liberation of Beiping, the workers of the electricity company worked day and night to repair them, and gradually restored the past power transmission system. More than 90% of the lines in the suburbs have now been restored to power, and the electric wires and equipment scattered among the people have also been recovered by the workers. From February 17th to 21st alone, when the workers were working in the suburbs, they found 40 kilograms of lead wire, 2850 kilograms of lead wire, 1403 kilograms of iron wire, 415 and a half kilograms of copper wire, and 489 kilograms of copper core, totaling 5199 and a half kilograms. The 26 employees of the business section handled nearly 600 power restoration tasks in three days. They voluntarily worked overtime, and the day shift wiring workers often did not stop working until 11 o'clock in the evening. The 55 employees of the accounting section simultaneously calculated the electricity bills for February and March, and the work was very intense. During the lunch break, most of them continued to work. Some even automatically cancelled their weekly holidays. When dealing with each case of electricity theft, the employees of the inspection section not only earnestly performed their tasks, but also carried out persuasion and explanation work. This was something that had never happened in the past. (Zhong)

　　冀北电力分公司职工  经过学习觉悟提高　劳动态度大大转变
    【本报讯】冀北电力北平分公司职工，经过一个月的学习，逐步树立了新的劳动态度，一扫过去国民党统治时期敷衍、拖延作风，把工作当成自己的事情，切实认真地负起应有的责任。在国民党反动派统治时期，发电厂由唐山往石景山运燃煤，每运必丢，平均损失约百分之六。现在则是买来多少，便运到多少，几乎一点损失都没有。在解放军包围北平期间，四郊线路被国民党军队破坏了八百根电杆，四十吨电线，大部被利用做了工事。北平解放后，电力公司工人昼夜尽力抢修，已逐渐恢复了过去的输电系统，现四郊关厢线路已有百分之九十以上恢复送电，散失在民间的电线器材，也被工人们自动找回许多。仅二月十七日至二十一日工人们在郊外做活时，就寻回铅丝四十公斤，铅线二八五○公斤，铁线一四○三公斤，铜线四一五公斤半，铜心四八九公斤。共五一九九公斤半。营业股二十六个职工，三天内处理了将近六百件的复电工作。他们自动加班，日班接线工人，往往到晚上十一点钟才停工休息。核算股五十五个职工同时计算二、三两个月份的电费，工作十分紧张。在中午休息时间，大多数还继续工作。有的把星期例假也自动取消了。稽查股的职工们，在处理每件窃电问题时，除认真执行任务外，还进行了说服和解释工作。这是过去一向所没有的。（仲）
