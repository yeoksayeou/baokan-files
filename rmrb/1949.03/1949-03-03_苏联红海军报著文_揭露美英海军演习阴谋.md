Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, February 1st: According to TASS, Moscow, February 25th: A Soviet Red Navy Newspaper observer pointed out that the current US naval exercises in the Caribbean Sea are of a brazenly aggressive nature. A total of 120 warships, hundreds of aircraft, and 35,000 British and Canadian landing troops participated in this exercise. The observer stated: American newspapers are heavily publicizing that such exercises will also take place in the Atlantic. Subsequently, Britain echoed this sentiment. British broadcasts and newspapers declared that at the beginning of March, the British Navy's Home Fleet would leave its home waters, pass through the Atlantic, and head to the Mediterranean to participate in exercises with the British Mediterranean Fleet. On its return journey, the Home Fleet will continue exercises in the Atlantic, which will coincide with the US Navy's exercises in the same area.

It is easy to infer that this entire demonstration is directly related to the impending conclusion of the "North Atlantic Treaty," which serves as the foundation for the aggressive bloc of reactionary forces led by the United States. The US-British bloc is relying on this saber-rattling action as a tool to bolster their prestige in front of those European countries being driven into this bloc. However, this policy of military expansion by the US-British ruling groups, manifested in the expansion of naval equipment and demonstrative exercises utilizing the atomic specter, is absolutely not approved by the working people of their own countries. The statement of the British Trade Union, representing 950,000 workers, proves this, stating that the British working people are greatly shocked by the preparations for a new war and demand improved relations with the Soviet Union. At the same time, the increasing movement in Norway against joining the North Atlantic Treaty further illustrates this. Finally, the difficulties encountered in the US Senate's review of the initial draft of the treaty similarly reflect that the policy of aggression, arms race, and saber-rattling is extremely unpopular among broad sections of American society.

### 苏联红海军报著文　揭露美英海军演习阴谋

  　揭露美英海军演习阴谋
    【新华社陕北一日电】据塔斯社莫斯科二月二十五日讯：苏联红海军报视察家指出，美国海军目前在加勒比海的演习，是有明目张胆的侵略性质。在此次演习中，共有一百二十艘战舰，数百架飞机及英国、加拿大的登陆部队三万五千名士兵参加。观察家称：美国报纸大事宣传在大西洋也将有这种演习。其后，英国也随声附和。英国的广播与报纸宣称：三月初，英国海军的国内舰队将驶离本国海面，经过大西洋开赴地中海，参加英国地中海舰队的演习。国内舰队在归途中，将继续在大西洋演习，那时，也恰恰就是美国海军将在该地演习的时候。
    很容易推测到这种整个的示威行动，是直接关系于即将缔结的“北大西洋公约”的，这一公约是作为以美国为首的反动势力侵略集团的基础的。美英集团凭借这种挥戈舞刀的行动，作为在这些正被驱入这一集团的欧洲国家前面支持他们威信的工具。但是，美英统治集团的这种穷兵极武的政策，以扩大海军装备及利用原子妖魔的示威性的演习而出现的这一政策，是绝对不能获得他们本国劳动人民的赞同的。代表九十五万工人的英国工会的声明即是证明，该声明称：英国劳动人民对准备新战争大为震惊，并要求改善对苏关系。同时，挪威反对参加北大西洋公约运动的日益增加，也进一步地绘了证明。最后，当美国参院审议公约初步草案时所遇到的困难，也同样反映了侵略、军备竞赛及刀光霍霍的政策，在美国社会广泛阶层中是极不得人心的。
