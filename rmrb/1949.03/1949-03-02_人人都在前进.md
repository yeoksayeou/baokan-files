　　Everyone is Moving Forward
    Jin Tuochen, Shijiazhuang Electric Company
    Due to the rapid development of the situation, many large cities have been liberated one after another, and a large number of excellent cadres have been transferred there to take on new construction tasks. Under such circumstances, all departments have a feeling of lacking cadres, but along with it, many new activists have emerged to replace the work of the former. Take a few comrades from our Electric Company as an example! Comrade Liang Bingjun of the Materials Section, for instance, has been working for more than ten years and has a wealth of experience in material management. He is responsible and knows how to unite people. Therefore, he was promoted to head of the Materials Section this time. Dong Baishun and Ren Baiyu also have considerable experience in their respective jobs and have been particularly active in war preparation and production competitions. This time they were also promoted to heads of the Accounting Section and the Business Section. Cook Li Congshun was promoted to staff member and is now doing statistical work in the General Affairs Section because he is active in his work and educated. Correspondant Ren Wuzi and attendant Zhao Yunshi automatically requested to study specialized technology in the laboratory, and the administration has satisfactorily responded to their requests based on their usual responsible and hardworking spirit.
    Due to the above facts, people have realized that only under the leadership of the Communist Party will talents not be buried, and everyone is moving forward.

　　人人都在前进
    石市电灯公司  金脱尘
    由于时局的迅速发展，许多大城市都相继解放了，大批优秀的干部，都被调往那里担任新的建设任务。在这样情况下，各部门都有缺乏干部的感觉，可是随着也产生了不少新的积极分子，来代替前者的工作。拿我们电灯公司几位同志来说吧！象材料科的梁炳均同志，工作已十几年了，对材料保管有很丰富的经验，肯负责并且能团结人，因此这次被提升为材料科科长。董百顺、任白玉，对他本职工作中也有相当经验，备战及生产竞赛中特别卖力气，这次也提升为会计科和营业科的科长。炊事员李从顺，因工作积极又有文化，升为职员现在总务科做统计工作，通讯员任五子、勤务员赵韵诗二同志自动的要求到试验室学习专门技术，行政上根据他们平日对自己的工作负责耐劳的精神，已满意的答复了他们的要求。
    由于以上的事实，使人们认识了，只有在共产党的领导下，才不会埋没人才，每一个人都在前进着。
