　　Female Warriors Marching Towards Chahar South
    Li Yanlian
    Last winter, the column of the Jin-Cha-Ji Expeditionary Field Army marched from the liberated areas towards Chahar South.

    In this marching column, some female warriors often attracted people's attention. They were praised: "Long hair, not simple, climbing high mountains, crossing great rivers, not afraid of the sun, wind, and rain, acting the same as male comrades."

    These female warriors were scattered in the various work posts of the Field Army Drama Troupe, Propaganda Team, and Field Hospital. They had all been tempered by the War of Resistance Against Japan and the land reform movement, and grown up in the embrace of the Party, in the struggle of revolutionary practice. In order to liberate themselves and completely eliminate the enemy, they left their hometowns, abandoned everything personal, and joined the Field Army and the expedition.

    Like the male warriors, they participated in a 120-li forced march and a 130-li surprise attack. Regardless of the raging wind and rain, the dark night, crossing thousands of mountains and ridges, walking along rugged cliffs, wading through the Sanggan River, Yongding River, Luan River, Bai River, and other rivers large and small. They had neither horses nor donkeys, carrying a certain amount of supplies and food on their own. Sometimes they rushed to the front of the troops with the marching propaganda team, did propaganda, and then rushed back to the camp. When there were no villages or houses, they, like everyone else, gathered around in groups of several female warriors, camping in the wild, under tree roots, in rock crevices, or under the eaves of houses. Since entering Chahar South, they have traveled from south to north, from north to east, from east to west, covering as much as ten thousand li.

    When stationed, they also carried out local women's work, publicizing the Party's policies and the victory of the People's Liberation Army, investigating the local women's situation, and helping to teach songs in local primary schools. They also helped the companies teach songs in the army, organized company cultural and recreational activities, and participated in performances and costumed propaganda. Usually, they participated in studies, classes, and discussions, and drills and exercises were no exception.

    During combat, they also participated in wartime propaganda stations, bandage stations, and comforting the wounded. When the troops finished fighting and occupied towns, they also participated in discipline inspections, especially the implementation of women's policy discipline. During wartime, when there were female prisoners, they participated in the handling of female prisoner work.

    In the field, at work, in labor, and in study, they transformed themselves and trained themselves. They became strong and brave. Among them, some became glorious Communist Party members, some were selected as model workers, and made meritorious contributions. Some were promoted to be the head of the drama troupe. They have personally experienced that women can only achieve true, lasting, and complete liberation by actively participating in practical revolutionary activities.

　　向察南挺进的女战士
    里燕联
    去年冬，晋察冀远征的野战军行列，从解放区向察南挺进。
    在这远征的行列里，常引起人们注目的一些女战士，她们被称赞着：“长头发，不简单，爬高山，跨大河，不怕太阳晒，风雨打，和男同志一样行。”
    这些女战士是散布在野战军剧社、宣传队和野战医院各方面的工作岗位上，她们都是经过了抗日战争的锻炼和土地改革运动，在革命实践的斗争中，在党的怀抱里成长起来的。她们为了解救自己，为了彻底消灭敌人，远离了家乡，抛弃了个人的一切，参加了野战军和远征。
    和男战士们一样，她们参加过一百二十里的急行军，一百三十里的奔袭战。无论狂风暴雨，漆黑的深夜，跨过千山万岭，走过崎岖悬崖，徒涉过桑乾河、永定河、滦河、白河等大小河川。她们没有马也没有驴，自己背着一定定量的东西和粮食，有时随着行军鼓动棚赶到部队前面，做了鼓动之后，又赶回宿营地。在没有村庄房子的时候，她们和大家一样，几个女战士围在一团，在野地里，树根下，石缝里或在房沿下露营。她们从进军察南以来，由南到北，由北到东，由东到西，走了足有万里。
    驻军的时候，她们还进行当地的妇女工作，宣传党的政策和解放军的胜利，调查当地妇女情况，到当地小学校帮助教歌子。在部队中也帮助连队教歌子，组织连队文化娱乐活动，参加演出和化装宣传。平时她们参加学习、上课和讨论会，而出操、演习等也不例外。
    作战的时候，她们还参加战时鼓动棚、绑带所、慰抚伤员等工作。当部队战斗结束占领城镇后，她们又参加纪律检查，特别妇女政策纪律的执行。战时有女俘虏的时候，她们参加处理女俘工作。
    她们在野战中，在工作中，在劳动中，在学习中，改造了自己，锻炼了自己，她们变得坚强勇敢了。她们之中，有的成为光荣的共产党员，有的被选为模范工作者，立了功。有的被提拔当了剧社社长。她们已经亲身体验到：妇女只有自己积极参加革命的实际活动，才能得到真正的永远彻底的解放。
