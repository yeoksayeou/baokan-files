　　The Beiping Military Control Commission Sends Personnel to Take Over the Pseudo-Judicial Institutions
　　Beiping People's Court is Established Simultaneously
[This Newspaper's dispatch] The former Kuomintang Beiping District Court and its Procuratorate, the Hebei High Court and its Procuratorate, the Supreme Court's Beiping Provisional Civil and Criminal Tribunal and its Procuratorate Branch, and the reactionary institutions affiliated with these judicial organs, such as prisons and detention centers, were officially taken over yesterday (the 18th) by personnel sent by the Beiping Military Control Commission. The above-mentioned reactionary judicial institutions have been abolished from the 18th onwards, and the Beiping People's Court was officially established on the 18th. Wang Feiran, the President of the Beiping People's Court, summoned all personnel of the above-mentioned institutions at the former High Court Garden at 9:00 a.m. yesterday for a speech. After Wang Feiran announced the significance of the takeover and the instructions from higher authorities, the takeover personnel carried two wooden plaques with the words "North China People's Court" and "Beiping People's Court" to the front of the gate, removed the old ones, and replaced them with the new ones. The atmosphere was extremely solemn for a time, and the onlookers were very excited. After the abolition of the pseudo-judicial organs, affairs are temporarily handled by the North China People's Court.

    【本报讯】前国民党北平地方法院及其检察处、河北高等法院及其检察处、最高法院北平临时民刑庭及其检察分署，和隶属于这些司法机关的监狱、看守所等反动机构，已于昨日（十八日）由北平军管会派员正式接管，上述反动司法机构从十八日起一律废除，北平市人民法院即于十八日正式成立。北平市人民法院院长王斐然于昨日上午九时，在原高院花园召集上述机构中全体人员讲话。王斐然宣示接管意义与上级训示后，接管人员将书有“华北人民法院”与“北平市人民法院”木牌两张抬至门首，撤掉旧的，换上新的，一时空气极为严肃，往观群众均甚兴奋。伪司法机关废除后，事务暂由华北人民法院处理。
