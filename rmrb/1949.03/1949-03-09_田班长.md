　　Squad Leader Tian

    Six o'clock in the morning, it was Squad Leader Tian's shift again.

　　The motor of a certain chemical factory throbbed, its sound exceptionally loud in the clear morning. Squad Leader Tian nodded, everything was fine: everyone in her squad had arrived on time, and the workers from the previous shift had quickly handed over the work. She secretly felt grateful to Da Chen; Da Chen was the squad leader of the previous shift, a strongly built man. She thought: how convenient it would be if she could always take over his shift!

　　Squad Leader Tian hadn't had enough sleep and just wanted to yawn, but she tried her best to restrain herself. She was a brave and resolute woman. This morning, her eyes were swollen like two small red peaches; it seemed she should have rested well, but she worked even harder than before.

　　Her regular job was to oversee all the chemical changes in the workshop. Chemical changes were untouchable and invisible from the outside. Apart from a few specific phenomena, experience could be said to be the workers' only basis. Based on this, Squad Leader Tian directed the work of the entire squad.

　　The chemical reaction had to go through six tall towers to be completed. And in the first tower, the reaction was the most complex. At the top of that tower, there were intermittent bursts of gas that could erode skin and respiratory organs; those who worked there needed to be as tough as hard rubber stoppers.

　　"Be a rubber stopper!" This phrase had become a common saying here. Except for the newcomers, everyone said it with a smile. After saying it, they almost all jumped and climbed up the tower to work, and they seemed to work very easily.

　　But going up to work on this tower wasn't too common either; it only happened when the squad leader thought there was a malfunction or a problem.

　　New workers, unfamiliar with the work, were always afraid to work there. Zhang Xiaocheng was one of the new workers, and he often thought in his head: going to that first tower was such a hard task! But he had never been assigned to the tower in Da Chen's squad.

　　Today's early shift, because Squad Leader Tian's squad had sick personnel, the work group temporarily transferred Zhang Xiaocheng from Da Chen's squad to fill in. Zhang Xiaocheng and another veteran worker, Comrade Lao Duan, were assigned to guard the first tower.

　　Squad Leader Tian came to inspect. Zhang Xiaocheng glared at her with dissatisfaction: she squatted down, focusing all her attention on first checking the temperature, then sticking to the glass window to examine the color of the gas, nodding, and then silently walking away to measure the specific gravity and make records.

　　Nothing happened! But Zhang Xiaocheng was extremely upset. He stared intently at the piston valve at hand, mentally reversing and misremembering the two sentences: "To increase it a bit, open ten degrees to the left!"

　　Lao Duan, however, became happy:

　　"Comrade, what are you staring at!"

　　"..." Zhang Xiaocheng shook his head and glared fiercely at Lao Duan, without answering.

　　"What's wrong? Swallowing water hyacinth, feeling stifled!"

　　"..." Zhang Xiaocheng ignored him.

　　"Comrade, headache, isn't it?" Lao Duan walked over seriously and gave him a tug.

　　"Hey, Lao Duan, labor discipline!" Zhang Xiaocheng jumped away as if ignited.

　　And over there, someone was shouting, it was Squad Leader Tian's voice:

　　"First tower, increase it a bit!"

　　Then came a repetition, two repetitions, but for two minutes, three minutes, the order was just an order, not immediately executed.

　　Zhang Xiaocheng left his post and stood in a daze. Because he was unfamiliar with the work and couldn't remember the two sentences, he became more anxious and didn't know what to do. Lao Duan also became more and more clueless; what to do, how to help this new comrade?

　　The nearby workers all ran over to them. The abnormal operation of the first tower quickly and sensitively affected all their work.

　　"Zhang Xiaocheng, hurry up!" Squad Leader Tian, who had rushed over, had dense beads of sweat on her forehead, the beads gradually thickening and shining. "Open forty degrees to the left!... Too much, ah, too much! What are you doing!... No, too little again! That's only twenty-five degrees!"

　　Probably the emergency measures wouldn't work, Squad Leader Tian instead became calm as a stone. Finally, she opened her mouth to ask:

　　"Zhang Xiaocheng, are you a new comrade?"

　　Zhang Xiaocheng stared with wide eyes, truly feeling stifled, no, he half-opened his mouth, trying hard, but couldn't answer.

　　"He's a new one!" Lao Duan answered for Zhang Xiaocheng from the side.

　　As all the workers had expected: the top of the tower began to spew out large plumes of gas, eroding people's skin and respiratory organs.

　　"Everyone back to your posts!" Squad Leader Tian tried her best to flatten her upper lip and ordered everyone. Then, to Lao Duan:

　　"Get a mask!"

　　Zhang Xiaocheng's eyes widened. The mask was quickly put on the female squad leader's mouth. She gestured, telling Lao Duan to take care of her temporary new partner, and then jumped and climbed up the first tower.

　　The white column of gas eroding human skin became thicker and thicker, fiercely enveloping Squad Leader Tian's entire body. The people below could vaguely see her bending down in a struggle; she was doing the work of plugging the leak so skillfully. Because the damage was too severe, the work seemed much more arduous. Several times, she had to stick her head out of the poisonous gas; it was a bright red face, her eye sockets full of tears, her eyeballs seeming larger and larger, and Zhang Xiaocheng almost burst into tears looking at it. How dangerous this situation was!

　　But Squad Leader Tian's struggle finally triumphed. The gas's rampage was only like the morning mist temporarily obscuring the sun. Look, that mist was getting thinner and thinner, until finally, the resolute and brave Squad Leader Tian who had conquered the poisonous gas was clearly visible.

　　And Zhang Xiaocheng? His throat choked, thinking "What a female squad leader!" in his mind: "If I have the chance, I must become a rubber stopper!"

　　田班长
    胡浣
    早晨六点，又是田班长这一班值班的时间了。
    某化学工厂的马达在蒲达蒲达地响，在清醒的早晨，它的声音显得分外的宏亮。田班长点点头，一切都很好：自己的班里都已按时到齐，上一班的工友也迅速地都把班交好。她心中暗自感激大陈，大陈是上一班的班长，人长得结实。她想：如果永远接他的班干活，该多么便当呀！
    田班长的觉还没睡足，只想打呵欠，但她尽力抑制住自己。她是一位勇敢刚毅的女人。今天早晨，她的眼睛肿得象两枚小红桃，看情形，她本该好好休息休息的，然而她却比以前做得更硬了。
    她经常的工作，是掌握全部工作室的化学变化。化学变化是外面摸不着、看不到的。除了极少的某些现象外，经验可以说是工作者的唯一的依据了。田班长便根据这，支配着全班工友的工作。
    化学变化的反应，要经过六个高大的塔才能完成。而在第一塔里，反应是最复杂不过的。在那塔顶上还间或有侵蚀人皮肤和呼吸器官的气体大量涌出，那儿工作的人，是需要象硬橡皮塞一样的顽强的。
    “作一个橡皮塞！”这句话，在这里已成为一句口头语了，除了新来的人外，大家都差不多是笑着说这句话的，说完，差不多也都是连跳带爬地上塔去工作的，他们工作得似乎非常轻松。
    而上到这个塔上去工作，也并不是太常见的事，那只是当班长认为有什么故障或毛病出来了的时候。
    新来的工人，因为对工作生疏，总是畏惧到那儿去工作。张小成就是新工人之一，常是在头脑里想着：上那第一塔是多么苦的差使啊！但是他在大陈班里一直没有被分配上过塔。
    今天早班，因为田班长班里有病号，上组便将张小成临时从大陈的班里调来补充。张小成就和另外一位老工人同志老段被分派去守第一塔。
    田班长来巡视了，张小成不满意地瞅着她：她蹲下去，全神贯注地先看温度，接着，贴到玻璃窗审察气体的颜色，点点头后，便默默走开量比重、作记录去了。
    没有事！然而张小成却心烦得紧。他瞪着眼，死瞧着手边的活塞门，心里颠倒地错记了那两句话：“要大点，便向左边开十度！”
    老段却开起心来：
    “同志，死瞅什么呀！”
    “……”张小成摇摇头，狠狠地回瞪了老段一眼，没有答话。
    “怎么？老太太吃水葫芦，闷起哪！”
    “……”张小成不理。
    “同志，头痛不是？”老段正色地走过来拉了一把。
    “嗨，老段，劳动纪律！”张小成却象点着火炸开一样地跳开来。
    而那边却也在喊，是田班长的声音：
    “第一塔，要大点！”
    又接着是一句重复，两句重复，然而两分钟、三分钟，命令只是命令，没有立即被执行。
    张小成离开岗位站着在发呆，由于工作不熟练，又记不住那两句话，就越急越不知怎样是好了。老段也越想越摸不着头脑，怎么办呢，怎么才能帮忙这位新来的同志呢？
    附近的工人们都跑到他们这儿来了，第一塔的不正常的操作，很快，很灵敏地影响了所有他们的工作情况。
    “张小成，快点呀！”赶来的田班长，额上冒出了密密的汗珠，汗珠渐渐凝大而且在发亮。“向左开四十度！……多了，啊，多了！你怎么的呀！……不行，又少了！那才二十五度呀！”
    大概急救也不成了，田班长反而镇静得象石头。终于开口问：
    “张小成，你是新来的同志？”
    张小成却瞪着眼，真个闷起嘴巴来，不，他半张着嘴，使劲，却答不出话。
    “他是新来的！”老段在旁替张小成回答了。
    如一切工人所预料的：塔顶腾腾地开始冒出了大股大股的气体，侵蚀着人皮肤和呼吸器官。
    “大家各归岗位！”田班长尽力拉平上唇下令给每一个人。然后对着老段：
    “拿口罩来！”
    张小成瞪圆了眼珠。口罩迅速套在女班长的嘴上，她打着手势，叫老段多照顾他那临时的新来的伙伴，便连跳带爬地上了第一塔。
    那侵蚀人肌肤的气体的白柱，越来越浓了，恶狠狠地卷住了田班长的全身，下面的人隐约可以看到她奋身地蹲了下去，她是如此熟练地作着堵口的工作。这工作，因为破坏的过于严重，显得是繁重得多了。好几次，她都不得不从恶毒的气体中伸出头来，那是一付鲜红的脸孔，眼眶里全是泪水，眼珠儿越来越显得大多了，张小成看着也几乎掉出了泪。这情景是多么危险啊！
    但是田班长的奋斗终于胜利了。气体的肆虐只象暂时遮隐太阳的晨雾，瞧啊，那雾是越来越稀薄，越稀薄，终于晴朗地看清了战胜毒气的刚毅勇敢的田班长。
    张小成呢？喉咙口哽住了“好一个女班长”地在思索着：“有机会，我一定要去作一个橡皮塞！”
