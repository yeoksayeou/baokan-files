　　The Steam Turbine Rotates Again
　　Meng Lian
　　Fan Chengze, a worker at the Shijiazhuang 310 Factory, started working in the factory at the age of thirteen. He now has twenty years of seniority. He is meticulous and responsible in his work. Every time he takes over the shift, he patiently checks the steam turbine's bearing bushes, thermometers, etc. He says that after the inspection, he feels more at ease when working. Comrade Yin Qingfa (nicknamed Da Yin) used to pull rickshaws for people. Later, he learned to be a worker. His hand was once injured by the steam turbine's fan blades, but through patient research and learning, he is now able to master the technology. He is consistently in good spirits when on duty, and sometimes he finds work outside of his job description to do. Once, the belt of the No. 2 well broke. He automatically used a belt buckle to fix it, saying, "This belt, which is more than four meters long, has broken five or six sections. If we can manage to use it for a longer period, we can save some expenses. Today the factory belongs to the workers themselves, and we shouldn't waste anything." On Tuesday morning at eight o'clock, after Lao Fan and Da Yin took over the shift, they found that the steam turbine was leaking oil, and the oil float (oil regulator) was sinking, which they found strange. They checked it at the time but could not find the cause. During the shift change, they told the other two shifts to pay attention and check together. The next day, some comrades thought that the oil float was leaking a bit, so the oil float was sinking, rather than the oil leaking out. But after they took over the shift, they found that the oil float was continuing to sink, and they became even more anxious. They planned to add some more oil. However, the warehouse didn't have any of this turbine oil in stock, and it couldn't be bought on the market. If they couldn't find where the oil was leaking, then even if they added oil, it would leak out, and the factory's losses would be great. During the three days of inspection, Lao Fan and Da Yin couldn't even eat their meals in peace. Once, Da Yin was eating when he suddenly threw his rice bowl aside and said, "I'm not eating it, let's go check again." They used flashlights to shine on all the oil pipes and related places, and after careful consideration and research, they finally discovered that because the steam valve was not tight, the oil climbed up the bottom of the steam blades along the central shaft bracket, and the oil hole on the outer sleeve of the central shaft was blocked due to its age, so the oil could not return to the oil tank from there. In this way, it ran out of the steam pump's exhaust pipe into a cement pool outside (according to theory and experience, it would not run out from this place, which is the main reason why it was not easy to find the fault). When they found more than a hundred pounds of oil in the cement pool on the third day, they excitedly shouted, "We've found it! Now we can feel at ease! If we couldn't find the cause, and the oil continued to leak, and the steam turbine's bearing bushes burned, the city's electricity supply would be greatly affected!" Afterwards, everyone collected the oil in the pool, filtered it, and put it back into the steam turbine, then repaired the steam valve, and the steam turbine started rotating again without stopping.

　　汽机又转动起来了
    孟廉
    石家庄三一○厂工人范成泽从十三岁起就到工厂作工，他现在已有二十年的工龄了；他对工作细心负责，每次接班时对汽机轴瓦、温度表等都要耐心的检查一遍，他说经过检查，工作起来心里就踏实了。尹庆发同志（号大尹）开始给人家拉包车，后来学了工，他的手曾被汽机风叶打伤过，但由于他耐心研究和学习，现在已能掌握技术。他值班时一贯精神很好，有时还找些本职以外的工作干，一次二号井的轮带断了，他自动的用皮带卡子把它接好，并说：“这四米多长的皮带已断了五、六节了，我们能凑合着多用一个时期，就可节约些开支，今天工厂是工人自己的，一点也不应浪费才对”。星期二上午八点，老范和大尹接班后发现汽机漏了油，油漂（制油器）向下沉，感到很奇怪，当时就检查，但没有找出原因，在换班时，又告诉另外两班注意共同检查。第二天，有的同志认为油漂有点漏所以油漂向下沉，而不是油漏跑了。但他们接班后，发现油漂在继续向下沉，这一下子他们可更着急了，计划着再添进一些油吧。这种透平油，库里既没有存的；市面又买不到，若找不出漏油的地方，就是有油随添随漏，厂子的损失可就大了。在三天的检查中，老范和大尹连饭都吃不安心，一次大尹正吃着饭，忽把饭碗扔在一边说：不吃它了，我们还去检查，他们用手电照遍了各个油管和有关的地方，并经过细心思考研究，终于发现了因汽门不严，油顺中心轴架爬上汽叶的下边，而中心轴外套的油眼又因年久被堵，油不能从那里返回油箱，这样就顺着汽泵乏气管跑到室外一个洋灰池子里（按道理和经验讲，是不会从这个地方跑出的，这是不易找出故障的主要原因）。当他们第三天找到洋灰池内的百余斤油时，高兴的叫：“这一下可找到了，我们心里可就踏实了，我们如果找不到原因，油再继续漏，烧了汽机轴瓦，全市用电将受到很大的影响呢！”之后，大家收起池内的油，过滤后又装入汽机，再把汽门修，汽机又在不停的转动起来。
