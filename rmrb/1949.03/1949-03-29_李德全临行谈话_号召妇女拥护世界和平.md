Li Dequan's Farewell Speech
Calling on Women to Support World Peace

[This Newspaper Reported] Mr. Li Dequan, who is about to attend the World Peace Congress, recently made a statement to reporters, which is summarized as follows:

The World Peace Congress has decided to convene in Paris, France on April 20th. What should China do about such a conference? Currently, China is at the height of its struggle for peace and democracy, and the liberation of all of China is imminent. The entire Chinese people love peace, and the entire Chinese people are willing to complete the new democratic revolution under the leadership of the Communist Party. The reactionary bloc headed by US imperialism realized their own domestic crisis immediately after the end of World War II, so as soon as the war ended, they wanted to launch a new war. On September 2, 1947, they initiated the "Inter-American Treaty of Reciprocal Assistance," on March 17, 1948, they initiated the "Western European Union," and recently signed the "North Atlantic Treaty Organization." These three things are essentially the same thing, mainly driven by US imperialist monopoly capitalists to instigate a new war.

Since the end of World War II, US imperialism has supplied the Kuomintang reactionaries with a lot of weapons, supporting the enemy of the entire Chinese people—the Kuomintang reactionaries led by Chiang Kai-shek! How many people have died in China! Can we forget US imperialism's devastation of the Chinese people?

Although the North Atlantic Treaty has been signed, this plan cannot be realized now. The people of the world, all peace-loving and democratic countries, must unite and strike a blow to the reactionary forces headed by US imperialism.

We women absolutely do not want our husbands, our brothers, our sons and daughters to be used as cannon fodder under the devastation of these imperialists. We should rise up and tell all the women of China: today the world is divided into two major camps, one is the camp led by the Soviet Union, fighting for democracy and peace, and the other is the imperialist bloc that aims to undermine the interests of the people. We women have a responsibility, no matter what, to prevent the poisonous plan of US imperialism to devastate the people from being realized! Sisters, let's mobilize and fight the enemy! We must join hands with all peace-loving and democratic people, together with the Soviet Union, to attack and oppose the executioners who devastate the people, the imperialists headed by the United States!

　　李德全临行谈话
    号召妇女拥护世界和平
    【本报讯】行将出席世界拥护和平大会的李德全先生，顷对记者发表谈话，兹摘要如下：
    拥护和平大会决定四月二十号，在法国巴黎开会了。中国对于这样一个大会，应该怎样呢？目前中国正处在一个为和平为民主斗争的最高潮，全中国的解放，眼看就要来到。全中国人民是爱好和平的，全中国人民愿意在共产党领导之下，要完成新民主主义的革命任务。以美帝国主义为首的反动集团，在第二次世界大战刚完了，就了解到自己本国的危机，于是战争结束，就想马上发动新的战争。在一九四七年九月二日，发起了“泛美公约”，一九四八年三月十七日，发起了“西欧联盟”，以及最近签订的“北大西洋联盟”，这三个东西根本是一个东西，主要的是美帝国主义独占资本家在鼓动新的战争。
    从第二次世界大战结束以后，美帝国主义供给国民党反动派很多武器，支援了全中国人民的敌人——蒋介石为首的国民党反动派！我们中国死了多少的人！我们能忘掉美帝国主义来摧残中国人民吗？
    北大西洋公约虽然订了，但是这个计划，现在不可能实现，全世界的人民，一切爱好和平民主的国家，大家都要联合起来，给美帝国主义为首的反动势力一个打击。
    我们妇女们，绝不愿我们的丈夫，我们的弟兄们，我们的儿女们，在这些帝国主义摧残之下当炮灰，我们应当起来告诉我们全中国的妇女们：今天世界是两个大营垒，一方面是以苏联为首的，为民主为和平而奋斗的大阵营，另一方面以摧残人民利益为目的的帝国主义集团，我们妇女有责任，无论如何绝不能让美帝国主义摧残人民的毒恶计划实现！大家姊妹动员起来，和敌人干！我们要和一切爱好和平民主的人民携起手来，和苏联一起，向摧残人民的刽子手以美国为首的帝国主义进攻，反对它们！
