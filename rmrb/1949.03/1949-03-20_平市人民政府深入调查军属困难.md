The Ping Municipality People's Government Conducts In-depth Investigation into the Difficulties of Military Families
[This Newspaper] In order to establish measures to provide preferential treatment to revolutionary military families and resolve the difficulties of military families in the city, the Ping Municipality People's Government is conducting in-depth investigations into specific situations, with the aim of formulating sound regulations for the preferential treatment of revolutionary military families as soon as possible. Revolutionary military families in Ping City have long been under the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang, suffering all kinds of persecution, unable to solve their livelihood difficulties, and even becoming displaced, fleeing to beg for food, and families separated. In the past month, in order to completely solve this problem, the Municipal Government has instructed the Civil Affairs Bureau's Preferential Treatment Section to actively handle it. In addition to dispatching working groups to conduct in-depth investigations, each district has been instructed to hold forums for military families to listen to their opinions and demands.

　　平市人民政府深入调查军属困难
    【本报讯】北平市人民政府为确立优待革命军人家属办法，解决本市军属困难，正深入调查具体情况，以期早日制定妥善的革命军人家属优待条例。平市革命军人家属长期处于国民党反动统治下，受尽各种迫害，生活困难无法解决，甚至流离失所，外逃乞食，妻离子散。月来市府为彻底解决这一问题，特责成民政局优抚科积极办理。除派遣工作组深入调查外，并分由各区召开军属座谈会，听取军属意见与要求。
