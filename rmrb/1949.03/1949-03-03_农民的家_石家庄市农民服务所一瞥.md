"The Farmer's Home"
　　A Glimpse of the Shijiazhuang City Farmer Service Center
    Xia Jingfan
    Since the news of the establishment of the Farmer Service Center by the Shijiazhuang Cooperative General Office spread to the ears of farmers in nearby villages, they all said, "It will be much easier to do business in the city in the future!" This sentence also shows the separation they had with the city in the past. Now that the city belongs to the people, they show kind smiles.

    The service center is located at No. 3 Daxing Street, Qiaodong. The large courtyard is cleaned up everywhere. One-third of the courtyard is piled with various types of coal specially prepared for farmers. At the entrance, there is a red couplet that reads "Think More for Farmers, Expand Material Exchange." The comrades working inside are waiting attentively for the villagers who come to the city with a concentrated attitude.

    This is an unprecedented new work to improve urban-rural ties. They first went deep into the countryside to promote it. The farmers were very happy to hear it, saying, "The current government is really thoughtful for us ordinary people." The farmers who come to the service center and receive care are all satisfied, praising the Farmer Service Center for truly serving the farmers, and praising it as "the farmer's home."

    However, some of the villagers who received care in ten days had quite a difficult experience. For example, the old farmer Pan Lao Zhong and his party of four from Side Village, Zhao County, drove two large carts loaded with 1,000 catties of sweet potatoes to the city to sell. Since the four of them rarely went to the city, they inquired about the vegetable market as soon as they entered the city. They inadvertently heard that the Farmer Service Center could handle matters for them. When they passed the entrance of the service center, they detoured in and asked in a curious tone: What exactly does this place do? The comrades who worked there diligently explained the task of the service center to him. Perhaps this made him feel too thoughtful, but he was hesitant and did not dare to try it rashly. After hesitating for a while, he finally said: "Let’s go to the city and take a look first." Before leaving, the working comrade responsibly told him again: "If you have anything you can't handle, come here, and we will definitely handle it for you." They continued to inquire about the address of the market and left. The four of them waited in the market from morning to night, and there were still more than 400 catties left unsold. Their hearts were concerned about the affairs at home. Although they shouted for a cheap sale, no one wanted to buy them. In the end, they had no choice but to think about trying the service center. As soon as they entered the service center, they quickly sold the remaining 400 catties of sweet potatoes at the market price. This made him feel that it was enough help, and he still needed to buy some other things. Without telling the people at the service center, he went out on the street by himself. He ran around many places to buy a pair of "wheel rims" and only found one store. When he asked, it cost 300 yuan in new currency for a pair, and he thought it was too expensive and didn't buy it. When he came back, he told the situation. The working comrade comforted him and said, "You should have entrusted this matter to us." While saying that, he picked up the phone and called the iron factory where he had already had contact. The reply he got was that it only cost 150 yuan a pair. The villager was very happy when he heard it and immediately asked him to buy it. He then automatically said that he wanted to buy some kerosene. The service center immediately took care of it for him, and the food and lodging for the night were also arranged for him. They seemed a little embarrassed and said: "It is so convenient for you to handle things for us. Otherwise, I would have to delay another day tomorrow—" His words seemed to imply regret for not believing the advice here in the morning.

    The next morning, a cart of coal was loaded at the service center, and the price was cheaper than in the market. They saved money here and solved their difficulties. Before leaving, they insisted on opening a few more meal tickets to express their gratitude. After repeated explanations that this place was specially for the villagers, they still refused. After pushing back and forth for a while, they took back the extra money, put the money in their waists with one hand, and patted the working comrade's shoulder with the other, saying: "You are really doing things for our farmers. We must publicize it to others when we go back and ask them to come to you when they come to the city."

    Seven farmers from Yang Village, Chenwei Village, Bocun Village, etc. in Shu County pulled five carts of seed cotton to the city to sell. They ran all over the flower shops, and they all said that they were not purchasing goods these days. In the absence of any other alternative, they pulled it into the service center. Four thousand catties of white seed cotton were immediately sold on their behalf at the market price. The remaining ninety-seven catties of purple flowers, because he wanted too high a price, could not be sold for a while, so he automatically requested to store them in the center and entrusted them to sell on his behalf. They were received with cordial and thoughtful service. Before leaving, they said gratefully: "From now on, consider this place as our home. We must come here when we come to the city to do business."

    For example, two farmers from Xinxin Village, Anguo County, pulled more than 400 catties of edible salt to the service center, requesting that it be sold quickly, saying that there were still things waiting to be done at home. The service center immediately introduced a buyer at the market price of four yuan and four jiao per catty, but he thought the price here was five yuan and one jiao when he came. Therefore, fearing that he would be deceived, although he repeatedly explained to him that this was the market price, he still did not believe it, so he pulled the salt away again. He spent half a day looking for it in the market, and those peddlers were unwilling to buy it even at the price of four yuan and four jiao. There was no other way but to return to the service center. As soon as he entered the door, he apologized and said: "I'm sorry, you are sincerely doing things for us, but I didn't dare to believe it. This time I understand it clearly." The service center still sold it on his behalf at the price of four yuan and four jiao. He finally said happily: "Next time I come to the city to do business, I will come here. It is so convenient for you to do things for farmers. Our government is really thoughtful for the people."

    From these farmers' interactions, they have actually experienced the benefits of the Farmer Service Center. We extend our heartfelt congratulations to this "farmer's home."

### “农民的家”　石家庄市农民服务所一瞥

　　“农民的家”
  　石家庄市农民服务所一瞥
    夏景凡
    石家庄合作总社举办的农民服务所，自成立的消息传到附近村庄农民的耳朵里后，都说：“这以后进城办事可方便了！”从这句话里也可看出他们过去对城市所存在的隔阂。现在的城市是人民的了，他们露出了亲切的微笑。
    服务所设在桥东大兴街三号内，大大的院子里到处都收拾得很整洁，院内三分之一的地方都是堆着专为农民预备的各种煤炭。门口写着“多为农民打算，展开物资交换”的红对子。在里边工作的同志都以聚精会神的态度殷勤的等待着进城的老乡们。
    这是改进城乡联系的一项史无前例的新工作。他们首先深入农村的宣传，农民们听到都非常高兴的说：“现在的政府为咱老百姓打算的真周到。”前来服务所受到照顾的农民，都心满意足的夸赞着农民服务所是真正为农民服务的，并誉为这是“农民的家”。
    但是在十天内受到照顾的老乡，有的是颇费周折的。象赵县三区四德村老农民潘老忠一行四人，赶着两辆大车装了一千斤红薯来本市卖，由于他们四个人都很少进城，一进市就打听菜市场，无意中打听到农民服务所可以为他们办事的消息，当经过服务所门口时便绕了进去，以新奇的口吻问：这里究竟是干什么的？工作的同志殷勤的向他说明服务所的任务，也许这使他感到太周到了，却半信半疑地不敢冒然尝试，犹豫了一会最后说：“我们还是到市上去看看再说罢。”临走时工作同志又向他负责的说：“你回头有什么办不了的事找到这里，我们一定为你办。”他们又继续打听着市场的地址走了。他们四个人在市上从早守候到晚，还剩下四百多斤没有卖完，家里的事牵连着他们的心，虽大叫贱卖，仍无人要买，最后没有办法，才想到尝试一下服务所。进到服务所很快的把他剩下来的四百多斤红薯照着市价推销了，这使他感觉到已经够帮忙了，还需要买些别的东西，没告诉服务所的人就自己出街了。要买一对“车圈”跑了许多地方才找着了一家，一问要新币三百元一对，他嫌太贵没有买成。回来才把这情形说了，工作同志向他安慰着说：“这事你该交给我们办。”一面说一面拿起电话叫到事先已经有过接头的铁工厂里。得到的回信是只要一百五十元一对，老乡一听高兴了，立刻叫帮他买下来。跟着自动的说还要买点煤油，服务所立刻给他照办了，晚上的食宿也为他安置好了。他们有些过意不去似的说：“你们这样为我们办事，真太方便了，要不然，明天我还得耽误一天功夫——”言下对于早上没有相信这里的忠告似有不胜遗憾之感。
    次晨在该所装了一车煤炭，价钱又比市上便宜，他们在这里省了钱又解决了困难，临走时一定要多开几个饭钱来表示他们的谢意，经一再解释这里就是专门为老乡们办事的，他们仍不肯，推让了一阵，他们才把多付的钱收起来，一手往腰里装钱，一手拍着工作同志的肩膀说：“你们真是为咱农民办事的，回去一定宣传给别人，要他们进城来都找你们。”
    束县杨村、陈位村、泊村等村七个农民拉了五车籽棉到市上卖，跑遍了花行，都说这两天不进货。在没有办法的情形下拉进服务所，四千斤的白籽棉照着市价立即为他们代销了，下剩九十七斤紫花，因为他要的价太高，一时卖不掉，自动请求存在该所并托以代销。他们被殷勤而又周到的招待着。临走时感激的说：“以后这里算我们一个家吧，进城办事一定到这里来。”
    又如安国县徐新村的两个农民拉了四百多斤食盐到服务所，要求快快卖掉，说家里还有事情等着要做，服务所立刻以市价每斤四元四角介绍了买主，但是他来时是以为这里五元一角的价钱。因此怕上当，虽然一再给他解释这是市价，他仍不信，就把盐又拉走了，在市上整整找了半天，那些小贩们连四元四角的价钱也不愿买，没办法又回到服务所，一进门便抱歉的说：“对不起你们了，你们真心为我们办事，我还不敢相信，这一次我可弄清楚了。”服务所仍然照着四元四角的价钱为他代销了。他最后高兴地说：“下次进城办事我就到这里，你们这样给农民办事，对我们太方便了。咱政府跟老百姓打算的真周到。”
    从这些农民的来往中，他们已实际体验到农民服务所的好处。我们向这“农民的家”致以衷心的庆贺。
