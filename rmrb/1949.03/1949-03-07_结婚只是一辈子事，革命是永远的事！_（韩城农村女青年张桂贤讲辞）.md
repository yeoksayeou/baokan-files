Xinhua News Agency editor's note: The following is a speech given by Zhang Guixian, a rural young woman from Hancheng County, Shaanxi Province, at the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region Women's Representative Conference held on January 26. She is twenty years old this year, has had half a year of schooling, and her family is a well-to-do middle peasant family. Zhang Guixian's speech vividly demonstrates the real changes in women in the liberated areas. This kind of material is much more convincing than many exaggerated arguments and dry reports. Her speech is now published as follows:

I am a representative of rural women in Hancheng County.

After Hancheng was liberated, the county sent a work team to our village. At that time, I wanted to participate in revolutionary work. But at that time, my mind was still somewhat feudal, and I was embarrassed to ask male comrades about the situation of the revolution, and I was very distressed. Later, Comrade Wei Yuling, a female member of the work team, came, and I was happy to invite her to live in my house. I kept her company, and she told me about the Communist Party's policies. One day, the work team was holding a meeting for war support work. I stood outside the door and quietly watched from the crack in the door as everyone discussed issues and raised opinions with great enthusiasm. When I thought about the Kuomintang being here, who would dare to make a sound at a single command? Thinking of this, I felt more and more that the People's Liberation Army was good.

A few days later, Comrade Yuling asked me if I would like to join the New Democratic Youth League, and I said I would. She brought me a form to fill out. Because I couldn't write, I said it, and she wrote it for me. She also told me how to develop new members. When Comrade Yuling was transferred away, I was so sad that I cried, fearing that after she left, my studies and work would be without direction. Later, a literacy class was set up in the village. Twenty-four people participated, divided into four groups. Each group elected a leader. Everyone elected me as the director. Some old women spread rumors saying, "The teacher holds the girl's hand to write." I explained to everyone, "It's a female teacher, not a male teacher!" The girls who attended the literacy class were no longer illiterate, and they worked even harder when they went home.

The People's Liberation Army passed through the village, and I saw that they were suffering and abiding by discipline, and they did not try to chat up young women, which made me very moved. Once, the public assigned the task of making cotton uniforms for the soldiers of the People's Liberation Army at the front line. There were two extra pieces that no one wanted to do, so I volunteered. I said, "It doesn't matter if I wear my own cotton clothes later, let the soldiers at the front wear them first, they have to resist the enemy for us!" When the comrade who collected the cotton clothes came, he asked, "Who made this? It's made so well?" They hung a sign on the clothes with my name written on it, and I was so happy! I told the students in the literacy class and asked them to learn from me.

The deputy township chief was corrupt, and we held a township meeting to replace him. The comrades of the work team said, "Women account for half of the population, you have to speak." So I made a suggestion, saying, "It is not good for the deputy township chief to be corrupt. In the future, when we elect the township chief, we must elect someone who is fair and can work for the people!" After the meeting, my uncle scolded me, saying, "None of the women in our village are as wild as you. Our Zhang family has never produced a woman like you!" I said, "If I want to make revolution, I have to be like this. As long as I don't mess around, as long as I do the right thing, I'm not afraid of anything!"

When I came to Yan'an to attend the meeting, my mother was afraid that I would not go back, and she cried very hard. I persuaded her not to be sad. I said, "You can raise a daughter who serves everyone, I am honored, and you are also honored." My mother said that I had lost my conscience and wanted to leave her. I said, "Mom! I haven't lost my conscience at all. While I am serving everyone, I am also taking care of you. You are also one of the masses!" My mother said, "What can you do by yourself!" I said, "When everyone gathers firewood, the flames are high. If all the women do as I do, the revolution will succeed quickly." I am engaged, and later, my mother asked me to get married first and then leave, saying, "Marriage is a major event in a lifetime." I said, "Marriage is only for a lifetime, revolution is forever! If the revolution succeeds, that is forever good!"

Seeing at the meeting that the Communist Party attaches so much importance to women's work, I am truly moved. Some comrades say that women's work is looked down upon. I would like to offer some advice to the comrades: as long as we respect ourselves, men will definitely respect us too. When I go home, I will not only publicize what the leaders said to them, but also bring back the issues we have studied and tell them, and encourage them to do women's work. I don't have the ability now, but I will study for a period of time when I go back, and I will work hard on women's work for the rest of my life. (Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 5th)

### 结婚只是一辈子事，革命是永远的事！  （韩城农村女青年张桂贤讲辞）

　　结婚只是一辈子事，革命是永远的事！
    （韩城农村女青年张桂贤讲辞）
    新华社编者按：下面是陕西韩城县农村女青年张桂贤在出席一月二十六日举行的陕甘宁边区妇女代表会议上的讲话。她今年二十岁，念过半年书，家庭是富裕中农。张桂贤的讲话，生动地表现了解放区妇女的真实变化。这种材料比许多夸张的议论和干燥的报道有说服力得多。现发表她的讲辞如下：
    　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　
    我是韩城县农村妇女的代表。
    韩城解放以后，县里派了个工作团到我们庄上。当时我就想参加革命工作。可是那时候我的脑筋还有些封建，不好意思向男同志问革命的情形，心里很苦恼。后来，工作团女同志卫玉玲来了，我高兴地请她住在我家。我给她做伴，她给我讲共产党的政策。有一天，工作团为了战勤的事在开会，我站在门外边，悄悄地从门缝里看见大伙讨论问题，提意见，可起劲啦。想起国民党在这的时候，一声号令，谁敢啃声？想到这儿，我就越发觉得解放军好。
    过了几天，玉玲同志问我愿不愿意入新民主主义青年团，我说愿意。她拿来了一张表让我填。因为我不会写，就由我说，她代我写。她还告诉我怎样去发展新团员。玉玲同志调走的时候，我难受得哭了，生怕她走了以后，自己的学习和工作没着落。后来村里办了个识字班。参加的有二十四个人，分了四个组。一组选一个组长。大家选我做主任。有些老婆子造谣说：“先生把女娃子的手抓住写字。”我就向大家解释：“是女先生，不是男先生！”女娃们上了识字班，就不当睁眼瞎了，回家做活还更起劲。
    解放军打庄头上过，我看见他们又吃苦又守纪律，也不找年轻女人拉话，使我很感动。有一次，公家分配替前线解放军做棉军衣，多了两件没人做，我就应承下来了。我说：“自己棉衣晚穿些不要紧，先叫前方战士穿上，他们要替我们抵挡敌人哩！”收棉衣的同志来了问：“这是谁做的？做得这样好？”他们在衣服上挂了个牌牌，写上我的名字，我心里可高兴透啦！到识字班讲给同学们听，叫她们都照我学。
    副乡长贪污，我们开乡民大会换掉他。工作团的同志说：“妇女占人数一半，你要发言。”我就提意见说：“副乡长贪污不好，今后咱们举乡长，一定要公正的、能给老百姓干事的才举！”开过会，我叔叔把我骂了一顿说：“咱们村的女子，没一个象你这样野。咱张家没出过你这样的女子！”我说：“我要革命就要这样。只要我不胡来，只要我干正当事，心不邪啥也不怕！”
    我来延安开会时，我妈怕我不回去，哭得很厉害，我劝她不要难受，我说：“你能养下一个为大家服务的女儿，我光荣，你也光荣。”妈说我丧了良心，要离开她。我说：“妈！我一点没丧良心，我一面为大家服务，一面还照顾你，你也是群众里的一个人呀！”我妈说：“你一个还能干出啥来！”我说：“大家拾柴火焰高，假使妇女都照我这样做，革命很快就成功了。”我是订了婚的，后来，妈又叫我先结婚再走，说：“结婚是一辈子的大事。”我说：“结婚只是一辈子的事，革命是永远的事呀！革命成功了，那是永远的好事！”
    在会上看到共产党把妇女工作看得这样重，我心里真感动。有同志说妇女工作人家看不起，我向同志们提点意见：只要我们自己看得起，男人一定也看得起。我回到家，不但要把首长讲的话给她们去宣传，还要把咱们研究的问题，带回去给她们说，宣传她们都做妇女工作。我现在没本领，回去学习一个时期，将来一辈子都要好好地做妇女工作。（新华社延安五日电）
