　　A Military Family School
    A certain column of the Central Plains Field Army established a revolutionary military family school. Over the past year, the students' thinking has greatly improved, and their cultural level has also generally increased, proving that this is one of the effective ways to help revolutionary military families and cultivate female cadres. The school is divided into six teams based on the families of each brigade and the directly subordinate units of the column, with a total of 1,214 family members and 688 children, plus a staff of 2,358 people. Most of the students are rural women who have just left their families. Because they have long been accustomed to scattered individual lives, some of them initially had more or less backward ideas such as selfishness, conservatism, and dependence on their husbands. In response to this situation, the school authorities decided to start with ideological education. As a result of the study, they initially distinguished the boundaries between the landlord class and the peasant class, recognized the pain and harm that the feudal system had inflicted on them, and were determined to remove the backward ideas brought from the old society and establish new proletarian ideas. In the past, many family members looked down on labor, but now they have generally changed this wrong attitude. In addition to consciously carrying out labor related to their own lives, they also helped the local farmers with the summer harvest, contributing more than 600 workdays. They also made more than 1,500 pairs of military shoes and more than 3,200 pairs of socks for the front-line troops. After this study movement, many students who had not joined the Communist Party requested to join the Chinese Communist Party. In less than a year, the school's party organization nearly doubled in size due to the absorption of many progressive elements. On the basis of ideological and political study, a cultural study movement was then launched. Before studying, illiteracy accounted for 41.9% of the students in the Fifth Team (the team with the lowest cultural level). After two months of cultural learning, even those with the least literacy knew 100 characters, and many people could write simple letters. For example, Yang Rui Jing, who is already in her thirties, started in the first grade. After two months, she was promoted to the second grade, and soon after to the third grade. Her diary, clapper talk, and letters of sympathy to the front lines were all very good and were praised by the higher authorities. Their learning enthusiasm is very high, and many students stay up late to study.
    Their children also received good education and care. In addition to 123 older children over the age of seven attending children's schools, the rest went to nurseries. The nursery staff is made up of students. After a short period of training, they are able to understand children's psychology and know common sense of child care. Therefore, the children are growing well and are very lively, which makes their mothers even more at ease with their studies.　　　(Xinhua News Agency)

　　一个军人家属学校
    中原野战军某纵队举办了一个革命军人家属学校，一年以来，在校学员思想有了很多进步，文化水平也普遍提高，证明这是帮助革命军属和培养妇女干部的有效办法之一。该校以各旅和纵队直属队的家属为单位，编为六个队，计家属一千二百一十四名，孩子六百八十八名，连同工作人员共二千三百五十八名。学员多数是刚离开家庭的农村妇女。因为他们长期习惯于分散的个体生活，因此开始时一部分人或多或少地存在着自私、保守及依赖丈夫等落后思想。针对这种情况，学校当局决定从思想教育作起。学习结果，她们初步地分清了地主阶级与农民阶级的界限，认识了封建制度所给予自己的痛苦与损害，决心去除从旧社会带来的落后思想，建立新的无产阶级思想。过去很多家属轻视劳动，现在一般地都改变了这种错误态度。大家除了自觉地进行有关本身生活的劳动以外，还帮助了驻地农民夏收，共帮了六百多个工。又给前方部队做了一千五百多双军鞋，三千二百多双袜子。经过这个学习运动以后，许多没有加入共产党的学员要求加入中国共产党。不到一年时间，学校党的组织由于吸收了许多进步分子，而扩大了近一倍半。在思想和政治学习的基础上，接着展开了文化学习运动。第五队（文化程度较低的一队）学员在学习以前，文盲占百分之四十一点九。经过两个月文化学习以后，识字最少的也识了一百个字，许多人会写简单的信件。如杨蕊精，已经三十多岁，开始时在一年级。两个月以后升到二年级，不久又升到三年级，她写的日记、快板和给前方的慰问信都很好，受到上级表扬。她们的学习情绪很高，许多学员深夜不睡觉进行学习。
    她们的孩子也得到了很好的教育和保育。除一百二十三个七岁以上的大孩子进子弟学校以外，其余的都进托儿所。托儿所的工作人员是由学员来担任的。她们经过了短期训练，所以能体会儿童心理，懂得护理儿童的常识。因此，孩子们长得很好，也很活泼，也就使得母亲们更加安心于学习。　　　（新华社）
