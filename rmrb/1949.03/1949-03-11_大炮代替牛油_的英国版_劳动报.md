Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 9th. TASS reports: The Labor News recently published an article entitled "The British Version of 'Guns Instead of Butter'," stating that the aggressive policies of the US-British bloc are inextricably linked to the new arms race. The White Paper on British armaments published in mid-February is a clear proof of this. The total military expenditure of the United Kingdom in the fiscal year 1949-1950 is set at £760 million, an increase of £107 million compared with the previous year. In addition, there is a huge and growing portion of military expenditure hidden under items such as non-military budgets and local colonial budgets. The degree of British militarization can be seen from a comparison of the current military budget with that of peacetime. In the fiscal year 1937-38, £726 million was used for military needs, while in the four years after World War II, officially announced military expenditure reached £3.967 billion. The Labor government is currently spending five and a half times more on the arms race than it did on the eve of World War II. The number of armed forces is projected to be 750,000 in 1949-50, about three times the number of British armed forces on the eve of World War II. In addition to these 750,000 people, there will be 100,000 local troops. The Labor government has passed laws enforcing compulsory military training in peacetime, and recently passed a law extending the training period from twelve months to eighteen months. Plans to expand military production are also being implemented. Secretary of Defense Alexander stated last September that the production of Britain's latest fighter planes has doubled, and the production of munitions, especially the latest tanks, has also doubled.
    The US-British bloc is dragging British dominions and colonies into the arms race. Military spending in Canada's new fiscal year has increased by $350 million compared to the previous year. Australia has been implementing a five-year plan to expand its military since 1947. The British government announced a new plan on February 23 to expand its armed forces, especially the navies of British colonies, with Africa and Southeast Asia taking the lead. British East Africa is considered a highly important strategic base for the British Empire and the US-British bloc.
    The author emphasizes that the scale of British armaments plans and the trend of military development are of a definite aggressive nature. The White Paper does not hide the fact that increased armaments are related to the obligations stipulated by the Western European Union and the North Atlantic Treaty. Britain's arms race is by no means for the defense of the British homeland or the British Empire, but for the US-British bloc's desire to dominate the world. Extensive armaments plans are militarizing the entire British economic life. Even British bourgeois figures point out that Britain is unable to cope with the arms race and will have to act according to the principle of "guns instead of butter, tanks instead of tractors." Huge military expenditures are exacerbating the tendency towards inflation. The total amount of currency in circulation is now three times what it was before the war. Prices have risen. If the price index for 1938 is 100, then the price index for November 1948 has jumped to 217 and is still continuing to rise. Britain's "Four-Year Plan" also bears the mark of a war economy. This plan focuses on developing those industrial sectors related to the production of armaments. By the end of 1948, the production of armaments, steel, chemicals, and copper consumption had exceeded pre-war levels, while the production of wool, food, and other items had lagged far behind pre-war levels.
    The huge military expenditure makes Britain more dependent on Wall Street. Aggressive foreign policies and the arms race will inevitably be followed by an attack by monopoly capital on the living standards of the British people. This attack is being carried out along various lines: inflation, reduced consumption, deterioration of living standards, and higher taxes. In 1938, taxes and insurance premiums paid by workers and staff were £109 million. In 1947, this figure reached £554 million. The entire British press cannot hide the decline in living standards in 1948. The bourgeois newspapers are calling on the people to tighten their belts, reduce consumption, and not resist the system of intensified labor intensity in industrial enterprises. All the sophistry propagated by capitalists about "equal sharing" of military expenses cannot deceive the British workers. The situation of the working people is getting worse and worse, while the capitalists are reaping huge profits from the "Cold War" and the arms race. The income obtained by the British bourgeoisie from profits and rents was £1.95 billion in 1938, while in 1947 it had reached £3.642 billion, almost doubling. There was even more increase in 1948.
    The author concludes by saying: The British working people are giving a clear and unambiguous answer to the aggressive conspiracy of monopoly capital. A declaration from Lancashire and Cheshire trade union representatives of nearly one million industrial workers delivered to the Soviet representative said: "We don't want an arms race, we don't want war, we want friendship and peace with the Soviet Union."

### “大炮代替牛油”的英国版　劳动报

　　“大炮代替牛油”的英国版
    　劳动报
    【新华社陕北九日电】塔斯社讯：劳动报顷刊载列明所作“‘大炮代替牛油’的英国版”一文称：美英集团的侵略政策与新的军备竞赛，有不可分离的关联。二月中旬发表的关于英国军备的白皮书，就是一个明证。英国在一九四九——一九五零年会计年度的军费总额，定为七亿六千万英镑。与前一年的军费相较，增加了一亿零七百万镑。此外，军费中还有巨大的、日益增长的部分，掩盖在非军事预算、殖民地本地预算等项目下。英国军事化的程度，可以从目前的军事预算与和平时期的军事预算的比较中看出来。在一九三七——三八年会计年度中，用于军事需要的为七亿二千六百万英镑，而在第二次世界大战后的四年间，官方宣布的军费已达三十九亿六千七百万英镑。工党政府目前用于军备竞赛的费用，为第二次世界大战前夕的五倍半。武装部队的人数，在一九四九——五零年预定为七十五万人，约为第二次世界大战前夕英国武装部队人数的三倍。除了这七十五万人以外，还得加上地方军十万人。工党政府通过了在和平时期实行强迫军训的法律，最近并通过将训练期由十二个月延长到十八个月。扩大军事生产的计划，同样也在实行。国防大臣亚历山大去年九月的声明指出：英国最新式战斗机的生产已增加了一倍，军火特别是最新式坦克的生产，也增加了一倍。
    美英集团正在把英国自治领和殖民地拖入军备竞赛中。加拿大新的会计年度中军事经费较前一年度增加了三亿五千万美元。澳大利亚自一九四七年起就一直在实行扩充军备的五年计划。英政府于二月廿三日宣布新的计划，扩充武装部队，特别是扩充英国殖民地的海军，非洲和东南亚居其中的首位。英属东非被认为是大英帝国和美英集团具有高度重要性的战略基地。
    作者着重指出：英国军备计划的规模和军事发展的趋势，具有确定的侵略性质。白皮书并不掩盖军备增加与西欧联盟和北大西洋公约所规定的义务有关。英国的军备竞赛，决不是为了英国本土或大英帝国的防御，而是为了美英集团统治世界的要求。广泛的军备计划，使得英国整个经济生活军事化。甚至英国资产阶级人士也指出：英国无力应付军备竞赛，而将不得不依照大炮代替牛油，坦克代替拖拉机的原则行事。巨额的军事费用，正使通货膨胀的倾向为之加剧。目前流通中的货币总数，为战前的三倍。物价上涨了。假如以一九三八年的物价指数为一百，则一九四八年十一月的物价指数已跃至二百一十七。如今仍在继续上涨中。英国“四年计划”也标明了战争经济的标记。这一计划着重在发展那些与生产军火有关的工业部门。至一九四八年年底，军备、钢、化学品生产以及铜的消费量，超过了战前的水平，而羊毛、食物等的生产，则大大落后于战前水平。
    大量的军费使英国更加依附华尔街。侵略性的外交政策和军备竞赛不可避免地将随之以独占资本对英国人民生活水平的进攻。这一进攻是沿着各种不同的路线进行的：通货膨胀、消费减少和生活程度的恶化以及更大的税额。在一九三八年，工人和职员所付的税款和保险费是一亿零九百万英镑。在一九四七年，这数目达到了五亿五千四百万镑。全英国报界无法掩盖一九四八年生活水平的下降。资产阶级报纸叫人民勒紧裤带、减少消费，而不要抗拒工业企业中更加加强劳动强度的制度。资本家宣传的关于“平等担负”军费的一切诡辩，都欺骗不了英国工人。劳动人民的情况正越来越坏，而资本家却从“冷战”和军备竞赛中搜刮巨大利润。英国资产阶级自利润和租金中取得的收入，在一九三八年为十九亿五千万英镑，而在一九四七年，则已达三十六亿四千二百万英镑，几乎增加了一倍。一九四八年更有增加。
    作者结语说：英国劳动人民正绐独占资本的侵略阴谋以明确而毫不含糊的回答。兰开夏和柴夏各工会代表将近百万产业工人递交苏联代表的宣言说：“我们不要军备竞赛，我们不要战争，我们要对苏友谊与和平。”
