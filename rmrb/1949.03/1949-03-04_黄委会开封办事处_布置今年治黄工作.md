Xinhua News Agency, Central Plains, 2nd. In order to deploy this year's Yellow River management work, the Kaifeng Office of the Yellow River Conservancy Commission convened a Yellow River conference in the middle of last month. More than 30 representatives from relevant special districts and counties attended the meeting. Zhao Mingfu, director of the Yellow River Commission Office, reported on the situation of the Yellow River project in Henan Province and the Yellow River management plan at the meeting, saying: From Guangwu, passing through Zheng County, Zhongmu, Kaifeng, Chenliu, Lanfeng and other counties to Simingtang in Kaocheng, a 156-kilometer-long Yellow River bank, is full of dangerous works. Due to the destruction by the Chiang Kai-shek bandits in the past, it is riddled with holes and very dangerous. According to our current manpower, material resources and technical conditions, the main task is to carry out temporary measures such as restoring embankments, repairing dangerous sections, and preventing breaches. However, we will still do our best to adopt fundamental solutions such as fixing the river channel and cutting bends to straighten the river. He emphasized that for seasonal work such as collecting materials in winter and flood prevention in summer, we must strive to take the initiative to ensure the main embankment and prevent breaches. He proposed that two sections of the embankment must be vigorously repaired, one is Huayuankou in Zhongmu, and the other is Simingtang in Kaocheng. The repair project should be completed by the end of May. The engineering work of repairing dangerous sections and collecting materials will be carried out in two phases: the first phase should be completed before the end of March, and the second phase should be completed before the end of July. In total, each section needs to prepare 23,840 cubic meters of stone (each cubic meter weighs about 3,600 kilograms), 4,600 cubic meters of bricks (each cubic meter weighs about 3,500 kilograms), more than 4.14 million kilograms of willow branches, 794 various wooden stakes, 3,748 kilograms of lead wire, and more than 44,000 kilograms of hemp rope. Note: The organization of the Yellow River Conservancy Commission is divided into three levels: branch, office, and section. The Central Plains Liberated Area has established the First Repair and Defense Office, which has four Repair and Defense Sections under its jurisdiction, namely Guangwu Zheng County Section, Zhongmu Section, Kaifeng Section, and Chen Lan Section. Engineering plans, supplies, and cadre transfers are led and supervised by the Yellow River Commission. The local government is responsible for flood prevention organization and the mobilization of manpower and materials.
