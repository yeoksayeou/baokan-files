Zhang Suo Buys an Ox
    Wang Yaping
    In the third year of the Liberation War,
    Victorious news spread everywhere,
    National victory is not far off,
    The rear is stepping up production.
    Let's start by singing about Hebei, Shandong, and Henan,
    This is a large plain,
    Good harvest of grains,
    The Yellow River runs through the middle.
    There are many villages north and south of the Yellow River,
    Farmers have suffered for thousands of years,
    The Communist Party's policies are good,
    Leading the poor to turn themselves over.

    There is a village called Yanjiadian,
    This village is by the river,
    After Double Reduction and liquidation,
    Land reform has been going on for a year or two,
    The village has three hundred households,
    The status of the poor has changed.
    How many heroes and models have emerged,
    Let me tell you a little story.

    There are many poor people in the southwest corner of the village,
    Living tenant farmer Zhang Qingan,
    Working hard for thirty years,
    Not enough to eat, not enough to wear.
    His son is called Zhang Suo,
    Begging with his mother and suffering from hunger and cold.
    He went to herd cattle at the age of ten,
    Learned to farm at thirteen or fourteen.
    After turning over after land reform,
    His thinking has changed,
    Joined the militia at fifteen or sixteen.
    He was the first to fight the landlords.

    His body is strong,
    With rough hands, big feet, and broad shoulders,
    Raw iron is refined in the fire,
    He suffered pain and torment,
    Land reform distributed nine mu of land,
    And three large rooms in the main house.
    It's like a traveler hurrying home on a snowy road,
    Receiving joy and warmth.

    The young farmer works hard,
    He lives a happy life.
    Second Aunt introduces him to a family,
    The daughter was born in Hujiazhuang,
    Born as a tenant farmer, she loves thrift,
    Her father's name is Hu Tingyuan,
    The daughter is talented and beautiful,
    Weaving cloth and working hard in the fields.

    One day at dusk after dinner,
    The stars in the sky had just come out,
    Zhang Suo's mother was sitting in the yard,
    Thinking of an important matter,
    This matter should be prepared early,
    She hurriedly called her son,
    Zhang Suo heard his mother calling,
    And stepped up to his mother.

    His mother said: "We used to suffer from hunger.
    Holding sticks to beg for food.
    It's a pity your father died early,
    And didn't see these new things.
    Our harvest is not bad,
    We have food, clothing, and pocket money,
    I plan to get you a wife,
    Sooner or later you will have companionship,
    My old hands and feet are not working well,
    And my eyes are blurred and I can't do needlework."
    Zhang Suo lowered his head and didn't answer,
    He had a plan in his heart——
    "Although marriage is not a business now,
    Adding people to the family always costs money.
    It is better to buy a cow first,
    Buying a cow to farm is good for production,
    Borrowing livestock requires exchanging labor,
    Plowing the land and pulling carts is really difficult."
    Young Zhang Suo raised his head and spoke,
    And told his mother his thoughts:
    "Our family has just turned over,
    Like a small tree with incomplete roots,
    Who doesn't want to marry a good wife,
    So as not to be a bachelor again,
    But production is more important,
    Buying a cow cannot be delayed any longer,
    The girl is only seventeen this year,
    Waiting another year is not too late.
    Our family has never had a cow,
    Working for others and sweating in vain,
    My father suffered all his life:
    All because the landlord oppressed us.
    Landlords kill people without shedding blood,
    And still can't pay off the rent and interest,
    Catching up with famine years and floods,
    My father starved to death on the road.
    To grow a big tree, you must first have roots,
    We must plan for the long term,
    Buy a cow to farm and get rich,
    Then marry a wife and settle down."
    Thinking of the suffering, he felt heartbroken,
    Mother and son both shed tears,
    Wiping away their tears and speaking,
    "I feel relieved after listening to you, son.
    That year we went to Li Jin to escape the famine,
    In the cold of winter in the twelfth lunar month,
    Your father pushed the luggage cart,
    Hungry in his stomach and cold on his body,
    Taking one step and falling one step,
    How can we keep warm without fire,
    He fell down in the middle of the night,
    Your father died on the road.
    I went to the village to beg the landlord,
    The landlord drove me out the door,
    The landlord said: 'It's your family's short life if you freeze to death.
    Don't bother me here!'
    Holding you in my arms, I guarded the corpse,
    Crying all night and another day,
    I sold the cart and bought a mat,
    And buried him in the Yellow Earth Mountain.
    Thinking of the landlord's great sins,
    I can't finish talking about them in ten days and a half.
    Now we have just turned over,
    It's difficult to make ends meet without a foundation,
    If you want to get rich,
    First buy livestock, hoes and sickles,
    In a year and a half,
    Buy all the clothes, beds and cabinets,
    Then I will get you a wife,
    So that the family is presentable inside and out."

    Zhang Suo's mother agreed to buy a cow,
    And went to the market to sell rice to exchange for money,
    His mother spins and weaves cloth to sell,
    And also takes time to weave straw hats.
    At the end of the year, she earned over a hundred thousand,
    And bought a calf and led it in her hand,
    Leading the calf home,
    Zhang Suo was very happy in his heart,
    Singing a ditty along the way,
    Singing about great production for prosperity,
    In the past, herding cattle for the landlord,
    Suffering from hunger and cold all year round;
    Today, buying a cow for myself,
    Grinding flour and farming is not difficult.
    Thinking and singing along the way,
    He soon came to his door,
    And hurriedly called his mother,
    "See if this calf is good?"
    His mother was spinning cotton thread,
    And hurriedly greeted him outside the door,
    Touching the calf's tailbone,
    And praised the calf:

    "The calf is born like a fierce tiger,
    Only two small teeth have come out,
    Sharp horns and black hooves,
    The whole body is golden yellow,
    Four small legs like wooden pillars,
    Can carry heavy loads without bending,
    It has strength for grinding flour and plowing the land,
    With flat shoulders, a long body, and a round butt.
    Good, good, really good,
    I like this calf."
    Zhang Suo worked even harder,
    And was happy in his heart without saying it,
    He moved the rice and beat the straw,
    And cleaned the manger to tie it up.

    Zhang Suo feeding the cow is not described,
    Let's talk about the neighbor to the west, Huang Dachuan,
    His father was also an old tenant farmer,
    Suffering from hardship since childhood.
    He joined the army at the age of sixteen,
    And served as a liaison in the company headquarters,
    He became a soldier at the age of nineteen,
    And was the first to charge into battle and kill the enemy,
    He was wounded in the Battle of Yanghu,
    And honorably retired to the village to resume production.
    He participated in land reform to fight the landlords,
    And led the masses to turn themselves over,
    He was given an old yellow cow,
    Ten mu of good land and nine rooms,
    He married a wife who was skilled,
    And raised pigs, fed cattle, and spun cotton diligently.
    He loves to work all year round,
    And is fair and impartial in his work.
    The masses elected him in a meeting,
    And elected him as a worker.
    One day he was sitting in the house,
    When Zhang Suo came to him to discuss something,
    The two had been together since childhood,
    Playing naked in the streets,
    They were very close when they met,
    And chatted about production.

    He saw Zhang Suo entering the door,
    And hurriedly moved a chair for him,
    Zhang Suo sat on the chair,
    And talked about buying a cow again.
    Dachuan said: "Your calf is well bought,
    And you will have a support for farming in the future,
    Although I have a cow, it has a weak body,
    And I haven't learned all the heavy work in the fields,
    The higher authorities advocate mutual aid,
    And it is better for more people to work together."
    Zhang Suo heard his words,
    And was happy in his heart and replied:
    "I came to you precisely for mutual aid,
    I was going to talk about it if you didn't mention it,
    My family has a calf,
    Plus your old cow,
    Both livestock are strong,
    It is more convenient for farming and pulling carts,
    You can do the light work in the fields,
    And I will take on the heavy work."
    Dachuan said: "Mutual aid is for our own benefit,
    It is easier to plan production with more people,
    Let's find Dazhu and Wang Wu again,
    It's not difficult for four families to work together."
    The two finished talking and made a plan,
    And in a blink of an eye, it was spring.

    The spring breeze blows the river open,
    The spring breeze blows the land soft,
    The willow branches have turned green,
    The farmers are plowing the land and cracking their whips,
    Zhang Suo put on the calf,
    And also Dachuan's old cow,
    Four families work together for mutual aid,
    Plowing the land and sowing seeds for production.

    Zhang Suo works hard and does his best,
    Not smoking, drinking, or spending money,
    Carrying a manure basket every day,
    Sweeping ashes and working hard without rest,
    Raising a pig to accumulate more fertilizer,
    The manure piles are like mountains,
    Spreading them on the ground cart by cart,
    Spring plowing is for hoping for autumn.

    A spring rain falls on the plain,
    The seedlings have all come out green,
    Zhang Suo was happy to see it,
    Cutting grass to feed the cattle until dark,
    Putting dry soil in the pen every day,
    The cattle do not get sick and there is more manure,
    People drink water from the pit to water the cattle,
    Zhang Suo carries water from the well to water the cattle,
    Adding more fodder to the trough,
    Feeding the calf until it is fat.

    In May, the wheat turns yellow,
    Zhang Suo cuts wheat to the front of the village.
    Dachuan and Wang Wu help him harvest,
    Holding small sickles in their hands,
    Cutting quickly with each sickle,
    Talking while cutting:
    Dachuan said: "Your wheat is growing well."
    Zhang Suo said: "It's all because of mutual aid for production."
    Dachuan said: "In the past, there were no cows to pull carts,
    And we had to harvest and carry it ourselves."
    Zhang Suo said: "One calf can't pull it,
    And we have to help it drag the back of the cart,
    When going uphill and downhill,
    Pulling with all our might is like pulling lead.
    Now pulling the cart is really easy,
    With a calf and an old cow,
    Rolling back home,
    Then use the accumulated manure in the field."
    Wang Wu said: "Production is not good without a cow,
    Production is more than half with a cow."
    Talking and laughing happily,
    The wheat was harvested in less than three days.

    Hoeing the ground shoulder to shoulder in summer,
    Zhang Suo follows Huang Dachuan,
    Carefully weeding and the seedlings are good,
    Hoeing the grass two or three times,
    The sorghum grows to ten feet tall,
    The millet ears are yellow and fresh,
    Planting green beans in the corn field,
    Planting red radishes at the edge of the field.

    Before we know it, autumn arrives,
    The farmers are as happy as celebrating the New Year,
    Dachuan and his wife harvest the millet,
    Zhang Suo comes to help,
    Taking off their shirts and working together,
    Like charging into battle,
    Working together to harvest,
    The piles of crops are placed all over the field,
    Their grain harvest is good,
    Yielding nine dou three per mu.

    The village inspects the mutual aid groups,
    And Zhang Suo and Dachuan are models.
    After harvesting the autumn, plowing the land early,
    And engaging in sideline occupations for the winter,
    Buying a few bundles of willow branches,
    Learning to weave manure baskets and baskets.
    Again, one evening after dinner,
    The stars in the sky are twinkling,
    A bright moon rises in the east,
    Shining on Zhang Suo's small courtyard.
    There is a wheat straw stack under the south wall,
    The straw stacks are piled up next to the house,
    There is hay hidden in the small alley,
    And sheep grass is built under the window,
    Chili peppers are hung on the poplar branches,
    A string of red and beautiful peppers.

    Mother and son sit opposite each other,
    And discuss their thoughts in detail:
    His mother said: "Seeing the good harvest this year,
    I won't have a hard time in the future,
    Mutual aid in farming leads to good harvests,
    Having enough food and clothing,
    Thinking of the suffering in the past,
    Who dreamed of having today,
    This is all because the Communist Party's policies are good,
    Leading the people to turn over and engage in production,
    Comparing this year with the past,
    It's like heaven and earth."
    Zhang Suo hurriedly replied:
    "From now on, the land belongs to ourselves,
    We live a happy life.
    Working hard brings food and clothing,
    After plowing the autumn land, go and make adobe,
    And build two or three new houses.
    Raise the calf quickly,
    And buy all the carts, hoes and plows."

    His mother clapped her hands happily,
    And interrupted before her son could finish speaking:
    "Our life is rising,
    Like the sun at noon,
    Marry a wife after harvesting the autumn,
    Start a family and do a good job,
    You work hard in the fields,
    And I and my daughter-in-law will spin more cotton.
    Next year, I will hold a grandson in my arms.
    My old age will not be lonely."
    While the mother and son were talking,
    Huang Dachuan came outside the door,
    Pulling a bench for him to sit on,
    He sat on the bench and smoked,
    Dachuan spoke slowly,
    And had a piece of news to tell him:
    "The village has established a cooperative,
    For grinding flour, pressing oil, and boiling saltpeter,
    In order to get rich and engage in sideline occupations,
    Everyone manages well and makes money,
    We should all buy shares.
    Learn some skills and increase production."

    The mother and son listened to his words,
    And strengthened their spirits and courage:
    "This method is good,
    We must buy shares and become members,
    As the saying goes, 'One thread is easy to break,
    A thousand threads cannot be pulled apart.'
    Rely on ourselves for working hard,
    And work together for cooperative production,
    After planting the fields, engage in sideline occupations,
    Our situation will greatly change."

    Dachuan said: "Our situation is really improving,
    And we must get rich and add people to the family,
    Zhang Suo is almost twenty years old,
    And should get married and start a family."
    Zhang Suo laughed in his heart when he heard this,
    And his mother was beaming,
    And hurriedly lit the lamp in the house,
    Pulling Dachuan to listen carefully:
    "Preparations for the wedding are ready,
    We have made quilts and clothes,
    And made a pair of floral pillows,
    Thanks to Daju for helping.
    Swallows fly in pairs,
    A good woman should be matched with a model man,
    Zhang Suo is a clumsy child,
    But he happened to find a beautiful girl.
    Quickly find your second aunt,
    And notify the Hu family to prepare the dowry,
    Let's settle the engagement tonight,
    And marry the bride on the fifteenth of October."
    Before we knew it, the day arrived,
    Zhang Suo got married and celebrated in the new house,
    Neighbors and relatives came to congratulate,
    With drums and music and loud trumpets,
    Little San called Big Wu, Lao Li called Lao Wang,
    Daju called Little Feng, Second Aunt called Big Aunt,
    Pushing me, pulling you, making noise inside and outside the door,
    Everyone says this daughter-in-law works hard,
    From now on, Zhang Suo's life will rise,
    And he is a good example of turning over and getting rich.

　　张锁买牛
    王亚平
    解放战争第三年，
    胜利消息到处传，
    全国胜利已不远，
    后方加紧闹生产。
    开腔要唱冀鲁豫，
    这是一块大平原，
    五谷杂粮收成好，
    一条黄河流中间。
    黄河南北村庄多，
    农民受苦几千年，
    共产党的政策好，
    领导穷人把身翻。
　
    有一个村庄颜家店，
    这个村庄靠河边，
    经过双减和清算，
    土地改革一两年，
    全村人口三百户，
    穷人的地位都改变。
    英雄模范出多少，
    有一件小事对您谈。
　
    村西南角穷人多，
    住着佃户张庆安，
    出力流汗三十年，
    吃不饱来穿不暖。
    他的儿子叫张锁，
    随母讨饭受饥寒。
    长到十岁去放牛，
    十三四岁学种田。
    土地改革翻身后，
    他的思想有转变，
    十五六岁上当民兵。
    斗争地主他当先。
　
    他的身子长的壮，
    手粗脚大膀子宽，
    毛铁投在火里炼，
    他受痛苦和熬煎，
    土地改革分了九亩地，
    分到堂屋三大间。
    道好似风雪路人赶回家，
    得到欢喜和温暖。
　
    年青农民劳动好，
    他的日子过的欢。
    二婶给他提亲家，
    闺女生在胡家庄，
    佃户出身爱勤俭，
    父亲名叫胡庭元，
    闺女人材长的俊，
    织布下地勤生产。
　
    有一天黄昏吃过饭，
    天上的星星刚出全，
    张锁娘正在院中坐，
    想起重要事一端，
    这事就该早准备，
    忙把儿子来呼唤，
    张锁听到娘来喊，
    一步走到娘跟前。
　
    他娘说：“咱们从前受饥饿。
    抱着棍子要饭餐。
    可怜你爹死的早，
    看不到这些新事面。
    咱的收成还不错，
    有了吃穿有零钱，
    我打算给你娶媳妇，
    早晚你也有陪伴，
    娘老手脚不灵便，
    眼花不能做针线。”
    张锁低头不答话，
    他心里有数暗盘算——
    “虽说如今婚姻不买卖。
    添人进口总花钱。
    不如把钱先买牛，
    买牛种地好生产，
    借人牲口要换工，
    犁地拉车真叫难。”
    小张锁抬头说了话，
    儿把心事对娘言：
    “咱的家里才翻身，
    好象小树根不全，
    谁不愿娶个好媳妇，
    免得再当光棍汉，
    只是生产更当紧，
    买牛不能再迟延，
    女家今年才十七，
    再等一年不算晚。
    咱家祖辈没有牛，
    给人种地白流汗，
    俺爹一生受穷苦：
    都只为地主压迫咱。
    地主杀人不见血，
    还不清租粮和利钱，
    赶上荒年上大水，
    俺爹饿死大路边。
    要长大树先生根，
    日子打算要长远，
    买牛种地发了家，
    再娶媳妇把家安。”
    想起受苦好心酸，
    娘儿两个泪不干，
    擦罢眼泪来说话，
    “听儿说罢娘心安。
    那年利津去逃荒，
    北风大雪腊月天，
    你爹推着行李车，
    肚里饥饿身上寒，
    走一步来跌一步，
    没有烟火怎取暖，
    赶到半夜人栽倒，
    你爹死在大路边。
    我到村里求地主，
    地主赶我门外边，
    地主说：‘你家冻死是命短。
    别到俺这里打麻烦！’
    怀里抱你守尸骨，
    哭了一夜又一天，
    卖了小车买席片，
    把他埋在黄土山。
    想起地主罪恶大，
    十天半月说不完。
    如今刚刚翻了身，
    没有根底难周转，
    要想发家来致富，
    先买牲口买锄镰，
    过个一年零半载，
    衣服床柜都买全，
    那时给你娶媳妇，
    家里外头都体面。”
　
    张锁买牛娘同意，
    赶集卖米去换钱，
    他娘纺花织布卖，
    抽空还把草帽编。
    年底赚了十几万，
    买个小牛手里牵，
    牵着小牛回家转，
    张锁心里多喜欢，
    一路之上唱小曲，
    唱个发家大生产，
    从前放牛为地主，
    一年四季受饥寒；
    今天买牛为自己，
    磨面种地不作难。
    一边想来一边唱，
    不远来到家门前，
    忙把亲娘来叫喊，
    “看这小牛沾不沾？”
    他娘正在纺棉线，
    急忙迎到门外边，
    摸住小牛尾巴骨，
    就把小牛夸一番：
　
    “小牛生的猛虎样，
    两个小牙才出全，
    尖尖角来黑蹄子，
    全身皮毛黄闪闪，
    四条小腿象木柱，
    能载重量腰不弯，
    磨面犁地有力气，
    肩平身长屁股圆。
    好好好来真正好，
    这个小牛我喜欢。”
    张锁忙的更有劲，
    嘴里不说心喜欢，
    搬过米来打谷草，
    收拾牛槽把它拴。
　
    张锁喂牛且不表，
    再说西邻黄大川，
    他爹也是老佃户，
    从小受苦受艰难。
    十六岁上去参军，
    当过连部通讯员，
    十九岁上当战士，
    杀敌冲锋他当先，
    大战杨湖挂了彩，
    荣退回村再生产。
    参加土地改革斗地主，
    领导群众把身翻，
    分子一只老黄牛，
    十亩好地屋九间，
    娶个媳妇身手好，
    养猪喂牛勤纺棉。
    他一年四季爱劳动，
    做事公正人不偏，
    群众开会来选举，
    选他担任工作员。
    这一天正在屋里坐，
    张锁找他来商谈，
    俩人从小在一起，
    光着屁股满街玩，
    碰到一起好亲热，
    不啦闲呱谈生产。
　
    他见张锁走进门，
    忙把椅子给他搬，
    张锁坐在椅子上，
    又把买牛说一番。
    大川说：“你的小牛买的好，
    以后种地有靠山，
    我虽有牛身子软，
    地里重活没学全，
    上级提倡搞互助，
    人多合伙好生产。”
    张锁听了他的话，
    心里喜欢忙答言：
    “找你正是为互助，
    你不说来我要谈，
    我家有个小黄牛，
    加上你的大老牛，
    两个牲口都有力，
    耕田拉车多方便，
    地里轻活你去做，
    出力重活我来担。”
    大川说：“互助合作为自家，
    人多生产好盘算，
    再找大柱和王五，
    四家合伙不费难。”
    俩人说罢订计划，
    日子一转到春天。
　
    春风吹的河水开，
    春风吹的土地软，
    杨柳树枝都发青，
    农民耕地打响鞭，
    张锁套上小黄牛，
    还有大川的老牛，
    四家合伙搞互助，
    耕地下种搞生产。
　
    张锁劳动加油干，
    不吃烟酒不花钱，
    天天背着粪箕子，
    打扫灰土忙不闲，
    养个小猪多积肥，
    粪堆攒的象土山，
    一车一车撒下地，
    春耕为了盼秋天。
　
    一场春雨落平原，
    小苗青青都出全，
    张锁看了心欢喜，
    割草喂牛忙黑天，
    圈里天天垫干土，
    牛不生灾粪多多，
    人家饮牛用坑水，
    张锁饮牛井上担，
    槽里多多加草料，
    喂的小牛肥团团。
　
    五月里来小麦黄，
    张锁割麦到村前。
    大川王五帮他收，
    手里拿着小镰刀，
    一镰一把割的快，
    一边割来一边谈：
    大川说：“你的麦子长的好”。
    张锁说：“都只为互助搞生产”。
    大川说：“从前拉车没有牛，
    自己收割自己担”。
    张锁说：“一个小牛拉不动，
    还得帮它拖车尾，
    等到上岗下坡路，
    出力拔筋象拉铅。
    现在拉车真容易，
    有了小牛和老牛，
    骨骨碌碌拉回家，
    再到场里用积粪。”
    王五说：“没牛生产搞不好，
    有牛生产多一半。”
    说说笑笑真快乐。
    三天不到麦收完。
　
    夏天锄地肩并肩，
    张锁跟着黄大川，
    细工除草苗子好，
    两遍三遍地锄草，
    高粱长到丈把高，
    谷子出穗黄鲜鲜，
    棒子地里带绿豆，
    红萝卜种在地头边。
　
    说话不及秋天到，
    农民欢喜象过年，
    大川夫妇割谷子，
    张锁跑来助一番，
    脱掉汗衫齐下手，
    好比冲锋到阵前，
    齐心互助收割罢，
    成垛的庄稼满场放，
    他们粮食打的好，
    一亩要合九斗三。
　
    村里检查互助组，
    张锁大川是榜样。
    收罢秋来早犁地，
    再搞副业过冬天，
    买来几捆柳条子，
    学编粪箕和筐篮。
    又是一天晚饭后，
    天上的星星打闪闪，
    一轮明月东方升，
    照到张锁的小当院。
    南墙底下麦秸垛，
    杆秸堆的到屋旁，
    小夹道里藏谷草，
    窗户底下砌羊草，
    杨树枝上挂辣椒，
    一串一串红艳艳。
　
    母子两人对面坐，
    又把心事细细谈：
    他娘说：“看见今年收成好，
    今后日子不作难，
    互助种地收成好，
    丰衣足食有吃穿，
    想起从前受苦罪，
    做梦谁望有今天，
    这都是共产党的办法好，
    领导翻身搞生产，
    拿着今年比往年，
    天上地下不一般。”
    张锁一旁忙答言：
    “从今土地归自己，
    咱的日子过的欢。
    劳动出力有吃穿，
    犁完秋地去打坯，
    再盖新屋两三间。
    快把小牛抚养大，
    车套锄犁都买全。”
　
    他娘喜的拍拍手，
    不等儿说忙插言：
    “咱的日子向上升，
    好似太阳到中天，
    收罢秋来娶媳妇，
    安家立业干一番，
    你到地里多劳动，
    俺和媳妇多纺棉。
    娘明年怀里抱个小孙孙。
    俺的老年不孤单。”
    母子两人正说话，
    门外来了黄大川，
    拉条板凳给他坐，
    坐在凳上就吃烟，
    大川说话慢吞吞，
    一件消息要他传：
    “村里成立合作社，
    磨粉打油熬硝盐，
    为了发家搞副业，
    大伙经营好赚钱，
    咱们都该入股。
    学点本领多生产。”
　
    母子听罢他的话，
    壮了精神壮了胆：
    “这个办法就的好，
    咱得入股做社员，
    常言道‘一条线来容易断，
    千条线来拉不断’。
    劳动出力靠自己，
    合作生产大伙干，
    种罢田地搞副业，
    咱们的光景大改变。”
　
    大川说：“咱的光景真好转，
    还要发家添人烟，
    张锁快到二十岁，
    就该娶亲成家眷。”
    张锁听了心里笑，
    他娘听了喜洋洋，
    忙到屋里点上灯，
    拉着大川听端详：
    “娶亲之事准备好，
    做了被褥和衣衫，
    做成一对花枕头，
    多亏大菊来帮忙。
    燕子飞来一双双，
    好女要配模范汉，
    张锁是个笨孩子，
    可巧找到一个俊姑娘。
    赶快找你二婶子，
    通知胡家做嫁妆，
    今晚说话算定亲，
    十月十五娶新娘。”
    说话不远日子到，
    张锁娶亲闹新房，
    四邻亲友来贺喜，
    鼓乐喧天喇叭响，
    小三喊大五，老李喊老王，
    大菊叫小凤，二婶叫大娘，
    你推我，我拉你，门里门外闹嚷嚷，
    都说这个媳妇劳动好，
    从今后，张锁的日子向上升，
    他是翻身发家的好榜样。
