　　Cheers of Victory
    ——Communication from the National Student Congress
    Liu Baiyu
    On March 1st, a group of young students, holding high the bright red flag, sang songs and marched freely and happily on the streets of Beiping, heading towards the auditorium of the Beiping Art College in Shuai Fu Yuan. The Fourteenth National Student Congress opened there. This was an extraordinary day, as one student said: "The days we longed for, pursued, and fought for with our blood have finally arrived." In front of the venue, the red banner "Students Nationwide, Unite!" fluttered in the wind. Hanging high in the venue was the congratulatory message from the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party. Another silk banner was a gift from the million heroic soldiers of the Pingjin Front, which read "Standing at the Forefront of the Struggle." The stage was piled with flowers, and the walls were decorated with commemorative badges of the congress in the shape of a historical giant wheel. Look! Representatives from all over the country marched in with their flags, and the band immediately struck up the Democratic Youth March. When the presidium walked onto the stage, cheers erupted, music played, and all the representatives sang "We are democratic youth, the vanguard of the people, led by Mao Zedong, wholeheartedly serving the people..." When it was proposed on stage to pay tribute to the leader of the Chinese people, Mao Zedong, the faces of the young students revealed their infinite love for their leader. Then, the entire audience stood up again to observe a moment of silence for the students who died in the struggle for people's liberation. The hall was so quiet that there was not a sound. In that moment, it made people think of the past days and nights, the sorrow and hatred, but also made us more aware of the precious value of today's victory. From the presidium, a young man walked calmly to the microphone. This was Chen Zhenzhong. He smiled and said: "The congress has opened victoriously today, in the birthplace of the student movement, in the ancient capital of victorious liberation." He then reported a series of names of delegations. Two hundred and four representatives, from the Yalu River to the Pearl River, this is the victorious meeting of Chinese students, a symbol of victory, a symbol of unprecedented unity.
    From the second day, the congress entered into a discussion of the "Draft of the Current Tasks of the Chinese Student Movement" and the "Constitution of the All-China Student Federation." In order to accomplish this historic task on their shoulders, the representatives worked until one or two o'clock in the morning every day, from group discussions to general assembly discussions, and made resolutions. By the fifth day, a brand-new leading body of the national student movement – the All-China Student Federation – was solemnly born. The sixth day was the day of the grand closing of the congress. On this clear morning, the students of the Northeast presented a flag to Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu at the congress. One side dedicated to Chairman Mao read: "We will always be your good students." One side dedicated to Commander-in-Chief Zhu read: "Without the People's Army, there would be nothing for the people." Amidst the solemn and majestic music, General Ye Jianying accepted the flag on behalf of them. Finally, Cheng Ting, a representative of the congress, delivered the closing speech, and he firmly announced: "Take all the resolutions to every corner of the country, ...students all over the country unite closely under the leadership of the All-China Student Federation to fight together." The congress completed its historical mission and announced its closing amidst cheers. However, the wave of victorious joy did not end. A scene symbolizing the infinite light in the progress of the new China's youth, a scene of fiery passion, appeared finally on the afternoon of the sixth day, which was the grand bonfire party held in the Democratic Square of Peking University.
    Democratic Square has truly become a place to radiate democratic light to all of China and the world. Countless student ranks rushed to the field, everywhere flags, everywhere cheers, a red cloth hanging from the top of the building read "Plant the victory flag all over China!" More than a dozen bright red flags on the top of the building fluttered in the wind. Hanging high on the rostrum was a huge portrait of Chairman Mao surrounded by electric lights. The intense light of the mercury lamps moved, illuminating - a sea of people, a sea of flags, and the smoke rising into the sky. When it got dark, the National Student Delegation entered the venue amidst the cheers of 50,000 people, circling the field. Suddenly a spark blazed up, it was the first torch, and the people around it showed a flower-shaped silhouette. But immediately the second, the third,... the torches in the hands of twenty people were lit. In the blink of an eye, the light torches formed a long ring, and the flames fluttered in the wind and entered the crowd. This was the sound of people roaring and drumming, their hearts were smiling, and the song "Ode to Light" shook the night sky. The torch circled the field and was thrown into the straight wood frame built in the center of the square, and the raging fire immediately soared into the air, illuminating every young face in the entire field. The voice of a young speech came from the loudspeaker, this voice contrasted with a bonfire in this square last March, when the square was surrounded by reactionary thugs and agents, and today,... "Fire, summons more partners, so that we and students from all over the country can meet here; fire, makes our young hearts melt stronger! And towards the blazing fire, we, representing 40,000 students in Tianjin, sincerely wish our National Student Federation Congress a successful completion, and hope that partners from different corners of the country will lead the fire of this congress to burn all over the country Different corners, especially those partners who are still fighting hard in Jiangnan, the torches in their hands are even more waiting for us to ignite each other. ..." The band played repeatedly, and the flames flew to the high sky like ten thousand stars, and next to this bonfire, dozens of red flags fluttered, gongs and drums clanged, countless young songs, accents, jumped up and sang, one team was in the north of the fire, and another team was in the south of the fire. , they smiled at the fire, and the fire smiled at them. I know that Chinese youth will always be as enthusiastic as fire, as heroic as fire, and as bright as fire. Let us remember the singing at the bonfire party! - "The darkness has been eliminated, and the red light is ahead."

　　胜利的欢呼
    ——全国学生代表大会通讯
    刘白羽
    三月一日，一群青年学生高举着鲜红大旗，唱着歌，自由、愉快地在北平街道上前进，走向帅府园北平艺术专科学校大礼堂。全国学生第十四届代表大会在那里开幕。这是不平凡的一天，如同一位学生所说：“我们过去所渴望的、追求的、并且不惜以鲜血来争取的日子，终于来到了。”会场门前迎风飘舞着“全国学生团结起来”的红幅。会场上高悬着中国共产党中央委员会的贺词，另一幅锦旗是平津前线百万英雄的解放军赠送的礼物，写着“站在斗争的最前列”。台上堆着鲜花，墙壁上装饰着历史巨轮形的大会纪念章。看啊！各地代表打着大旗走进来，乐队立刻锵然鸣奏起民主青年进行曲。会议开始，当主席团走上台时，欢声雷起，奏乐，全场代表高唱“我们是民主青年，是人民的先锋，毛泽东领导着我们，全心全意为人民………”。当台上提出向中国人民领袖毛泽东致敬时，青年学生们的脸上都流露出对自己的领袖的无限热爱。接着，全场再次起立向为人民解放斗争而死难的同学默哀、礼堂内肃静得一点声音没有。这一刹那间，使人想起了以往的多少日夜，多少悲哀与仇恨，但由此也使得我们更认识今天胜利的宝贵价值。从主席团里，一个青年沉静的走上扩音器前，这是陈震中。他微笑着说：“大会今天胜利地开幕了，是在学生运动发祥地，是在胜利解放的古都。”他接着报告出一连串的代表团名字。二百零四个代表，从鸭绿江到珠江，这是中国学生胜利的会合，是胜利的标志，是空前团结的标志。
    大会从第二日，便进入对于“中国学生运动的当前任务草案”与“中华全国学生联合会章程”的讨论。代表们为了完成双肩上这一历史重任，每天到深夜一两点钟还在工作，从小组发展到大会讨论，并且做出了决议。到第五日，一个崭新的全国学生运动的领导机关——中华全国学生联合会就庄严地诞生了。第六日，是大会隆重闭幕的一天。在这一个晴明的上午，东北学生在大会上向毛主席、朱总司令献旗，献给毛主席的一面上写着：“我们永远当你的好学生。”献给朱总司令的一面上写着：“没有人民军队便没有人民的一切。”在隆重而庄严的乐声里面，由叶剑英将军代表受旗。最后由大会代表程挺致闭幕词，他坚决的宣布：“将一切决议带到全国每一个角落里去，……全国同学紧密团结起来在全国学联领导下，共同奋斗。大会完成了自己的历史使命而在欢呼声中宣布闭幕了。可是，胜利的欢悦的浪潮并未完结，象征着新中国青年前进中无限光明的一幕，火一样的热情奔腾的一幕，却在六日下午最后出现，那就是在北京大学民主广场上举行的盛大的营火晚会。
    民主广场，真正成为向全中国、全世界发射出民主光芒的地方。无数学生行列向场上奔来，到处是旗，到处是欢声，从楼顶垂下的一条红布上写着“把胜利旗帜插遍全中国！”楼顶上十余面鲜红大旗，在风中猎猎飘动。主席台上高悬用电灯所环绕的毛主席巨像，水银灯光强烈的移动着，照射着——人的海，旗的海以及向天上腾起的烟雾。天黑的时候，全国学生代表团高举红旗，在五万人欢呼声中进入会场，绕场一周。突然一点火光熊熊燃起，那是第一把火炬，围绕它的人，现出花形的黑影。可是立刻把第二把第三把，……二十人手上的火炬都亮了。一转眼，光炬拉成一条长环，火焰迎风飘荡着走入人群。这是人声呼啸鼓噪，心都笑开了花，“光明颂”歌声震动着夜空。火炬绕场一周，投入广场中心搭好的直柴架，烈火立刻腾空而起，映红了全场每一副年青的面孔。扩音器里传出年青的致词的声音，这声音对比了在这广场上，去年三月的一次营火，那时广场四周布满了反动派的打手、特务，而今天，………“火，召唤来更多的伙伴，使我们和全国各地同学在这儿会师；火，使我们青年的心溶结得更坚强！而向着烈焰冲天的火，我们代表天津市四万同学，谨祝我们全国学联大会胜利的完成，并希望来自全国不同角落的伙伴，引着这次大会的火种，燃遍全国不同的角落，尤其是那些尚在江南艰苦奋战的伙伴们，他们手中的火炬，更有待我们互相点燃。……”乐队连番的鸣奏，火焰向高高的天空有如万点繁星鼓舞飞腾，就在这火堆旁，几十面红旗招展，锣鼓铿锵，无数年青的歌声、腔手，跳起来，唱起来，火的北面是一队，火的南面又是一队，他们对着火笑，火对着他们笑。我知道，中国青年是永远象火一样热烈，火一样英勇，火一样光明。让我们记下营火晚会上的歌声吧！——“黑暗已消灭，红色的光在前头。”
