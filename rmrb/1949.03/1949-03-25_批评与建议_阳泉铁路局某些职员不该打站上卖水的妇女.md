Criticism and Suggestions
Some Staff Members of the Yangquan Railway Bureau Should Not Hit Women Selling Water at the Station

To the Editorial Comrade:

    There are many poor citizens in the Third Street of the First District of Yangquan City, and more than seventy people make a living by selling water at the railway station. This year, the railway bureau forbade poor people from selling water at the station. This group of poor people then went to the street cadres every day to seek a solution. When the street cadres contacted the station, the police section chief said: The reason for not allowing citizens to sell water is to avoid disorder and prevent danger. However, the staff cooperative selling water was not interfered with. The poor people were somewhat dissatisfied.

    On February 1st, several poor people came to the station to sell water with pots. The guard asked: "Who told you to come and sell water?!" One of the women, Dong Sanni, said: "My stomach told me to come and sell water." The guard thought what she said was a bit harsh, so he casually broke one of her pots and took her to see the captain. Upon seeing the captain, she was immediately detained. From 12 o'clock at night until dawn, after pleading, she was released and warned not to come to sell water again. The next day, a thirteen-year-old girl, Hu Jinsheng, had her arm dislocated, and she still cannot move. She also has no parents to take care of her. On several other occasions, the poor people had already sold water to customers and received the money, but they forcibly made the customers return the water. In total, they broke more than thirty pots belonging to water sellers. We feel that this is really inappropriate. The railway bureau should conduct a thorough investigation and stop such illegal behavior.

### 批评与建议  阳泉铁路局某些职员不该打站上卖水的妇女

　　批评与建议
    阳泉铁路局某些职员不该打站上卖水的妇女编辑同志：
    阳泉市一区三街贫苦市民很多，有七十余人就以车站卖水为生。今年正月铁路局禁止贫民到站卖水，这一批贫民便每天找街干部解决。当街干部到站接洽的时候，警务段队长说：不让市民卖水是为的避免秩序紊乱和防止出危险。但职工合作社卖水却没有受干涉。贫民就有些不满。
    二月一日那天，有几个贫民，提着壶到站卖水，站岗的问：“谁叫你们来卖水？！”其中有个妇女董三妮说：“我的肚子叫我来卖水。”站岗的嫌他说的有点难听，便随手打坏了她一个壶，拉着他去见队长去了，见了队长，即把她扣起来啦。从晚十二点到天亮，经过他的恳求，才放回去，并警告她再不能来卖水。第二天又把一个十三岁的小女孩胡金声的胳膊甩挫了骨，现在还不能动，又没父母照管。还有几次是贫民已将水卖给客人，钱也收了，但他们硬让客人把水退回，共计打了卖水人的壶三十多个。这件事我们觉得实在不合适，铁路局应作深刻检查，并制止在此种违法行为。
