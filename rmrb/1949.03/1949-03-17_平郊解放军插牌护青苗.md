PLA in the Suburbs of Beiping Plants Signs to Protect Seedlings

[Beiping News] A transport battalion of a certain unit of the PLA in the suburbs of Beiping cherishes seedlings. All comrades in the battalion spent an afternoon investigating all the wheat fields in the surrounding garrison area that had been trampled into paths. They immediately used shovels and picks to turn over the hardened soil. The Third Company's garrison area had many wheat fields near the main road. After turning over the hardened soil, they also used bricks to build a row of garden bed-like edges along the fields, and inserted wooden signs reading "Protect Seedlings" on the edges. The Second Company turned over hardened soil and planted signs in 39 places. In order to correct the habit of the people taking small paths and trampling on wheat fields, the battalion also convened meetings of Bao and Jia heads by village unit, and universally carried out propaganda to protect seedlings among the masses, telling them that the army had notified all units not to take small paths, and requested that the people also not walk on wheat fields.

　　平郊解放军插牌护青苗
    【平市讯】平郊解放军某部辎重营爱护青苗，全营同志以一个下午的时间，调查清楚了周围驻区所有被人踏成道路的麦地，立即用锹镐把死土都翻了起来。三连驻区靠大道的麦田多，他们在翻起死土后，并用砖头砌成了象花池子似的一溜地沿，在地沿上插上了“爱护青苗”的木牌。二连翻死土、插牌子达三十九处。该营为改正老百姓走小道、踏麦田的习惯，又以驻村为单位召集保甲长会，并普遍向群众进行保护青苗的宣传，告诉群众：军队已通知各部都不走小道，要求老百姓也不走麦田。　　　　（李决、于云盛）
