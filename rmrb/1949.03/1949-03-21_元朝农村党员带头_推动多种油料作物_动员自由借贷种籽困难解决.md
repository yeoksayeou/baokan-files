(Jinan Electric Dispatch) Rural branch members in Yuanchao County are actively promoting the planting of oil crops to ensure the completion of the county's plan to increase the planting of oil crops to 20% of the total cultivated land. At the Party member village cadre conference in the seventh district, in order to overcome seed difficulties, an appeal was made to Party members and village cadres to voluntarily lend seeds to others and mobilize farmers to freely lend to one another. After the meeting, Liu Tingzhong, the branch secretary of Zhangluji, said: "After returning this time, I will correct the problems of boasting and retreating in the face of difficulties. I am determined to complete the task." The Yuanzhuang area in the third district plans to increase the planting of peanuts, sesame, and other crops to 30% of the cultivated land. It also plans to add 32 livestock, plow the land four inches deep, harrow and hoe four times each, and apply four large carts of fertilizer per mu. After discussions by the village branches, Party members went to the farmers to mobilize them. Some farmers in Nantoutou said: "There is no idle land, so there is no way to plant." Party members explained that planting peanuts could be exchanged for more grain, and the farmers then accepted the planting plan. He Dongfa, a farmer in Zhangluji, was afraid that planting peanuts would be labor-intensive. Party member Yang Huaitang mobilized him, saying: "If you plant two mu of peanuts, the seedlings alone will be enough to feed the calves. Otherwise, you will have to spend so much money on buying grass, just like you did last year." After calculating the costs, Dongfa realized that he was right and decided to plant three mu of peanuts. In this way, 11 households in the village, which originally planned to plant 14 mu of peanuts and 18 mu of sesame, now plan to plant 20 mu of peanuts and 23 mu of sesame. The Qian Shalu branch in the fourth district found that many families lacked peanut seeds. After discussion, Party members Ren Jingxiang and others lent seeds to the masses at an interest rate of five percent. At the same time, because Party members Feng Xianglian and others planted 23 mu of peanuts, they influenced the masses to change their planting plans and increase the planting of oil crops. They also proposed to process more, collect more manure, and ensure a yield of 280 jin per mu.

　　元朝农村党员带头
    推动多种油料作物
    动员自由借贷种籽困难解决
    【冀南电】元朝县农村支部党员，积极推动种植油料作物。保证完成全县争取种植油料作物达耕地总数百分之二十的计划、七区的党员村干大会上，为克服种籽困难，号召党员及村干部自愿向外借贷，并动员农民自由借贷。会后，张鲁集支书刘廷忠说：“这次回去，纠正挑战说大话、遇到困难向后转的毛病，决心完成任务。”三区元庄小区计划争取种花生芝麻等达耕地百分之三十。并计划增添三十二个畜力，地犁四寸深，耙锄各四遍，每亩上肥四大车。各村支部经过讨论，党员分头深入农民中动员。南安头有的农民说：“没有闲地，没法种。”党员即说明种花生能多换粮食，农民才接受了种植计划。张鲁集农民何东法，怕种花生费工，党员杨怀堂动员他说：“你种二亩花生，光秧子就够小牛吃的。要不，就象你去年一样，光买草就花那么多钱。”东法一算帐，果然不差，决心种三亩花生。就这样，该村有十一户原计划种十四亩花生、十八亩芝麻，现改为二十亩花生、二十三亩芝麻。四区前沙路支部，发现有很多家缺花生种籽，随即作了讨论，党员任景象等便以五分利息贷给群众。同时，由于党员冯香连等四人种了花生二十三亩，影响群众纷纷改订种植计划，增种油类作物，并提出多加工多拾粪，每亩保证收二百八十斤。
