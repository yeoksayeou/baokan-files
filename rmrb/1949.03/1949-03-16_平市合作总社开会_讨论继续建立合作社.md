　　Meeting of the Ping City Cooperative General Society
  　Discussing Continuing to Establish Cooperatives
    [Report from this newspaper] The Beiping City Cooperative General Society convened a meeting of cadres from employee cooperatives of various public factories in the city on the 15th to discuss how to continue establishing factory consumer cooperatives and how to ensure the supply of daily necessities for employees when paying wages in the first half of March. At the meeting, Director Wang of the society first reported on the situation of the cooperatives in the past half month, pointing out that 10 factories have established consumer cooperatives among the 27 public factories in the city. According to statistics from eight factory cooperatives such as the Telecommunications Bureau: there are more than 55,000 members, supplying more than 1.33 million catties of food grain (other oil, salt, etc. are not included in the statistics), which has played a significant role in guaranteeing the supply of employees' daily necessities and reducing exploitation by middlemen. However, many factories have not yet established cooperatives, and many problems in the existing cooperatives have not been properly resolved. Therefore, factories that have not established cooperatives should quickly select preparatory personnel, prepare cooperative furniture, publicize the significance of organizing cooperatives to employees, and formally establish cooperatives by recruiting members. Existing cooperatives, in addition to continuing to expand membership, should convert each share of 50 yuan into 4.5 catties of millet. From the 16th of this month, each share will be re-set to 5 catties of millet. Those who joined the cooperative in the past but have not paid the share capital should quickly collect it to ensure capital turnover and guarantee supply. Regarding how to guarantee the supply of daily necessities for employees when paying wages, after discussion, everyone decided that each factory should first conduct a statistics of the number of food grain and sundries needed by employees, and quickly report to the General Society for allocation. In addition, a specific supply plan should be made and announced to employees and members, so that they can purchase in a planned and organized manner, not only to prevent members from delaying production, but also to ensure that members can buy things immediately after receiving their wages.

　　平市合作总社开会
  　讨论继续建立合作社
    【本报讯】北平市合作总社于十五日召开市内各公营工厂职工合作社干部会议，讨论了如何继续建立工厂消费合作社，以及怎样在发三月份上半月工资时，保证职工生活必需品的供给问题。会上，首由该社王主任报告半月来合作社的情况，指出本市内二十七个公营工厂已有十个厂建立了消费合作社。据电信局等八个厂社的统计：拥有社员五万五千余人，共供给食粮一百三十三万余斤（其他油、盐等未统计），在保证职工生活品的供给上，减少职工被中间剥削上、起了很大作用。但还有不少工厂未建立起合作社，已有的合作社，还有不少问题没有得到适当解决。因此，合作社的工厂，应迅速选出筹备人员，准备合作社的家具，向职工宣传组织合作社的意义，吸收社员正式建立。已有合作社的，除继续扩大社员外，应将每股金五十元折合小米四斤半计算，从本月十六日起，每股股金改定为小米五斤。过去入社而未交纳股金者，应迅速收集起来，以便资金周转、保证供给。如何在发工资时保证职工生活必需品的供给问题，经大家讨论决定各厂首先进行职工需要食粮和零用品的数目统计，迅速报总社以便拨付。另外应作出供应具体计划，向职工社员宣布，使其有计划有组织的进行购买，不但使社员不误生产，而且能保证社员发下工资后即时能买到东西。　　（赵刚）
