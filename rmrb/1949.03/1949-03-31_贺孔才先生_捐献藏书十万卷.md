【Ping City News】Mr. He Kongcai, a resident of Beiping (formerly the Secretary-General of China University, whose three sons have all joined the revolutionary work), recently unconditionally donated his family's collection of 100,000 volumes of books, accumulated over 200 years, to the People's Beiping Library. He said, "In the past feudal era, the government and the people were opposed to each other, exploitation was everywhere, and corruption was rampant. If I had given it to them, it might have been secretly given to foreigners long ago." Now that Beiping is liberated, he feels relieved and boldly dedicated them. He entrusted someone to negotiate with the Cultural Takeover Committee and sent the catalog he had spent more than a year compiling. After the Cultural Management Committee reported this to the Military Control Commission and obtained approval, the Cultural Management Committee, together with the Beiping Library, went to count the books on the 25th and expressed their deep respect for Mr. He's loyalty to the people's cause. Among the books, there are dozens of Yuan and Ming dynasty editions, and the collection of seal manuals is particularly rich, including many original rubbings that are extremely difficult to obtain. While counting the books, Mr. He said, "My long-cherished wish has come true, the time is right, I can put down the burden, and move forward happily!" He also expressed: Only the Communist Party's theory is truly thorough, penetrating, comprehensive, and has effective methods and results. He is willing to be an anonymous and practical worker, a primary school student of the masses.

　　贺孔才先生
    捐献藏书十万卷
    【平市讯】北平市民贺孔才先生（曾任中国大学秘书长，三个儿子均已参加革命工作）近以二百年来家藏图书十万卷无条件的捐赠给人民的北平图书馆。他说：“在过去的封建时代，政府和人民是对立的，无处不在剥削，无处不是私弊，我送给它，也许早已偷送给外国人了。”今天北平解放了，他才放心大胆地把它献了出来。他托人向文化接管委员会商洽，并送来他费时年余才写定的书目。经文管会呈报军管会获得同意，乃于二十五日由文管会会同北平图书馆前往点收，并对贺先生之忠于人民事业深表敬意。图书中元刻本、明刻本多至数十种，印谱收藏尤富，内多极不易得的原拓印本。贺先生一面点书，一面说：“多年心愿，时机已到，放下包袱，痛快前进！”并表示：只有共产党的理论才真是彻底的、透辟的、周详的、有办法有实效的。他愿意做一个无名的切实的工作者，做一个群众的小学生。
