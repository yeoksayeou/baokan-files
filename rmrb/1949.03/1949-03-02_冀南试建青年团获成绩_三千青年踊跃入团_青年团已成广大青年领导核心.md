　　Successful Pilot Program for Youth League in Southern Hebei
  　3,000 Young People Enthusiastically Join
    Youth League Becomes Leading Core of Broad Masses of Youth
    [Reported by This Newspaper] The pilot program for establishing the New Democratic Youth League in various parts of Southern Hebei, from the end of October last year to the end of January this year, has resulted in the establishment of 200 rural Youth League branches and 20 Youth League branches in schools and government offices, with 3,000 members. In Yuancheng County alone, there are 61 Youth League branches with 1,978 male and female members. The majority of the Youth League branch members are able to unite the broad masses of young people outside the League to actively participate in various tasks, becoming the core of the broad masses of young people, and have won the enthusiastic support of the broad masses and young people. When the Youth League was first established, some young people and the masses did not understand the Youth League and had concerns. However, after in-depth publicity and education, their doubts and concerns were dispelled. For example, the mother of Xue Zeng from Huazhuang initially did not want her son to join the Youth League, but after it was explained that the Youth League educates young people to do good deeds and to go in the right direction, and especially after seeing the Youth League members buying manure baskets from Zhangluji, she said, "If I had known earlier that the Youth League calls for learning well and engaging in production, I would have told my Xue Zeng to join earlier." Huang Meihai said about his brother: "My Guihai used to be idle and undisciplined, but since joining the Youth League, his performance has been really good. During the day, he works when there is work to do, and gathers manure when there is no work. He learns to read at night." Many rural young people are actively requesting to join. For example, Huang Guijuan said: "I have applied to join the Party several times and was not allowed, but this time I must resolutely join the Youth League." Some of the young people in the Southern Hebei Cultural Troupe have made plans to overcome their shortcomings and are asking the Youth League for help in order to strive to join. After young people are organized into the Youth League, their revolutionary enthusiasm and work enthusiasm are further enhanced. For example, in Qianxiancheng, Huazhuang, and other villages in Yuancheng County where the Youth League has been established, youth winter schools or literacy classes were quickly established. Ma Zhangyu from Shanyue Village learned 60 characters in ten days, and seven models who helped others learn emerged. As soon as the Huazhuang Youth League was established, each person made a production plan. Han Yuxiang, the young women's committee member from Qianbaozhuang, leads several young women to spin cotton collectively every night. In villages with the Youth League, young people dare to speak and act in all aspects of class division, replenishment, and Party rectification, and are very active. After joining the League, Wei Honglin immediately stopped smoking cigarettes and resolved not to raise pigeons to avoid delaying production. The members decided to get up early every day to collect manure. Due to the active exemplary actions of the members, the League is gradually forming into the leading core of the broad masses of young people.

　　冀南试建青年团获成绩
  　三千青年踊跃入团
    青年团已成广大青年领导核心
    【本报讯】冀南各地试验建立新民主主义青年团从去年十月底到今年一月底三个月中，已建立起二百个农村团支部、廿个学校与机关团支部，有团员三千人。其中仅元朝一县即已有团支部六十一个，男女团员一千九百七十八人。大多数团支部的团员都能团结团外广大青年积极参加各种工作，成为广大青年的核心；并获得了广大群众和青年的热烈拥护。在青年团初建立时，有部分青年和群众对青年团不了解，存有顾虑，但经过深入宣传教育后，他们的怀疑和顾虑打破了，如化庄学增他娘开始不愿她儿子入青年团，经过说明青年团是教育青年办好事、往正道上走、特别是见到青年团员从张鲁集买了粪篮回来，她说：“早知道青年团叫学好、叫生产，早叫俺学增参加了。”黄梅海说他兄弟：“俺桂海吊儿浪当，自在青年团后表现真不错了，白天有活干活，没活拾粪，晚上识字。”好多农村青年都积极要求参加，如黄桂卷说：“我要求好几次入党没允许，这回成立青年团要坚决参加。”冀南文工团的青年，有的订出计划，克服缺点，要求青年团给予帮助，以便争取入团。青年们被组织到青年团之后，革命热情与工作积极性更加提高。如元朝县的前现城、化庄等建了团的村庄，很快就成立了青年冬学或识字班，山岳村马章玉十天学会六十个生字，并出现帮助别人学习的七个模范。化庄青年团刚成立，每人就订了生产计划；前鲍庄青年妇女委员韩玉祥，每晚带领几个青年妇女集体纺花。有了青年团的村庄，青年在划阶级、抽补、整党各方面都敢说敢做，十分积极。魏洪林入团后马上不抽纸烟了，并决心不玩鸽子以免耽误生产。团员们决定每天早起拾粪，由于团员们的积极模范行动，团逐渐在形成为广大青年的领导核心。
