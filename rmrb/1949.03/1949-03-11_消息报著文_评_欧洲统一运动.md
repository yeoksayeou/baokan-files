　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, March 8th: TASS Moscow dispatch: A commentator in the News Report mocked the so-called "European Unity Movement" Brussels conference, saying: Although this Brussels farce, in which the number one warmonger Churchill participated, was staged in the beautiful Palais des Beaux-Arts in Brussels, it was unable to conceal the crudeness of the farce, thanks to the mockery of fate. At this meeting, Churchill gave two speeches in one day as an enticement to the public, but the public expressed their attention to this Fulton hero in a rather peculiar way. At the rally held in the square in front of the Brussels Stock Exchange, Churchill, Spaak, and other speakers were scorned by the public. Churchill left the venue under the protection of armed motorcycle teams. The News Report commentator pointed out: "The characteristic of all the 'representatives' gathered in Brussels, starting with Churchill himself, is that they have completely lost the trust of the democratic forces in their own countries and in the world." This can also be applied to the traitors of Eastern European countries, for example, the Bulgarian traitor Kimito, the Polish reactionary Racinsky, the French right-wing socialist Stonehouse, the British Conservative Dunkin, and people who have no other "social" significance other than being Churchill's son-in-law. So, why did Belgian Prime Minister Spaak preside over this meeting, and why did Harriman, the roving ambassador of the European Marshall Plan, also attend the meeting as a guest of honor? The answer is simple and clear. Churchill's "European Unity Movement" is fully in line with the aggressive policies pursued by the reactionary leaders of the United States and Britain, and it serves them as a special laboratory, the largest part of which subsequently becomes a practical political "business." Churchill's anti-Soviet and anti-People's Democratic countries' remarks once again revealed the true purpose of the initiators and instigators of all kinds of covenants and groups. The News Report commentator concluded: Churchill's "United Europe" is deeply hostile to the people. Even the clumsy design of electing French socialist Stonehouse as chairman of the "European Movement International Committee" cannot help Churchill and his lackeys to conceal this hostility. Socialist traitors are "qualified" to work side by side with warmongers.

  　评“欧洲统一运动”
    【新华社陕北八日电】塔斯社莫斯科讯：消息报评论员嘲笑所谓“欧洲统一运动”的布鲁塞尔会议说：这个有第一号战争贩子邱吉尔参加的布鲁塞尔丑剧，虽然是在布鲁塞尔的优美艺术宫里上演的，但是，由于命运的嘲笑，并没有能够掩饰得住这个丑剧的粗制滥造。在这个会上，邱吉尔一天发表了两次演说，作为对公众的引诱，可是，公众却以颇为特别的方式表示了他们对于这位福尔顿英雄的注意。在布鲁塞尔证券交易所门前广场举行的大会上，邱吉尔、斯巴克和其他演说人，遭到了公众们的鄙弃。邱吉尔在武装摩托车队的保护下离开会场。消息报评论员指出：“从邱吉尔自己算起，聚集在布鲁塞尔的所有“代表们”的特点，就是他们已经完全失去了其本国和世界民主力量的信任”。这也可以应用到东欧国家的叛徒们，举例说，保加利亚卖国贼基米托、波兰反动派拉辛斯基，法国右翼社会党人石屋，英国保守党人邓金和除了是邱吉尔的女婿以外没有其他“社会”意义的人们。那么，为什么比利时总理斯巴克来主持这个会议，欧洲马歇尔计划巡回大使哈里曼也作为贵宾参加这个会议呢？答案是简单而清楚的。邱吉尔的“欧洲统一运动”完全符合美国和英国的反动领袖们所奉行的侵略政策，它作为一种特别的实验室来给他们服务，这个实验室的最大部分，随后就变成了实际的政治“买卖”。邱吉尔的敌视苏联和人民民主国家的发言，再度泄露了一切种类的公约和集团的发起者、鼓动者们的真正目的。消息报评论员结语称：邱吉尔的“统一欧洲”，对人民是深怀敌意的。即使是选举法国社会党人石屋担任“欧洲运动国际委员会”主席的设计拙劣的办法，也不能够帮助邱吉尔和其奴仆们把这种敌意掩盖起来。社会党叛徒们是“够格”和战争贩子并肩共事的。
