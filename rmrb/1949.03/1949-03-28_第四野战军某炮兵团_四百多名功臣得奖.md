Xinhua News Agency, Peiping, March 26th: A certain anti-aircraft artillery regiment of the special forces of the People's Liberation Army's Fourth Field Army held a celebration and commendation conference during its training period. Ten units and more than 480 heroes received award banners and medals. Since its establishment, the regiment has participated in famous battles such as Changchun, Jinzhou, and Tianjin, achieving repeated successes and shooting down as many as six enemy aircraft. In terms of political work, the 2nd Company of the 1st Battalion of the regiment maintained high morale throughout the march into the customs, ensuring that the entire company entered the customs with a full complement of personnel, vehicles, and weapons. At the celebration conference, the regimental leaders called for "striving to study politics diligently, improve skills, and strive for even greater achievements in the consolidation and training." The heroes all expressed that they would never be arrogant and that they would work harder to study in the future and help those who had not yet made contributions to do so.
