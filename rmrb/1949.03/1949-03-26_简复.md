	The quality of the relationship between husband and wife cannot be evidenced by the presence or absence of children.
    Mr. Xiaohan: (1) The quality of the relationship between husband and wife cannot be evidenced by the presence or absence of children, and third parties have no right to interfere. (2) If the parents of both parties disagree after the divorce, and the woman does not leave her husband's family, she can be persuaded to remarry. If the woman raises the issue of bringing property, she should be given a share according to the principle of equal division of land per person, and a share should also be given to the child if she brings the child.

　　　　The "divorce requires mutual consent" law has no such provision.
    Mr. Zhou Yixin from Yongbi Village, Seventh District, Huolu: Your mother, believing rumors, forced you to marry Liu Shu. Now that the relationship is not good and you cannot continue to maintain the marital relationship, you can file for divorce. However, the man cannot use returning wheat or millet as a condition for divorce. The Zhentou District Government said: "Divorce requires mutual consent," but the law has no such provision.

If you have any questions in the process of learning, please raise them as much as possible for joint research. Mr. Li Tao:
    You are preparing to set up a stall on the street to sell daily necessities. If it is temporary, we have asked the Public Security Bureau, and it is not necessary to register or pay any fees. (This is a temporary regulation.) If you are doing business without a storefront, you should register with the Municipal Administration for Industry and Commerce.
    Mr. Lu Xing: The Beijing Municipal People's Court has begun to work. You can go directly to ask about property litigation issues. Regarding the sale and transfer of house ownership, you must register with the Beijing Municipal People's Government Land Administration Bureau to be considered valid.
