　　CPC Central Committee North China Bureau
  　Instructions on Launching Agricultural Production
    (March 1949)
    The Central Committee pointed out in the autumn of last year, when the land reform was completed, that launching a large-scale production movement would be the overriding central task from now on. Now that the spring plowing has begun, the Party committees at all levels should, on the basis of last winter's production, focus on spring plowing and lead and launch the agricultural production movement.

    The favorable conditions for developing agricultural production in our region this year are: land has been completely and equally distributed, land ownership certificates have been issued, land rights have been determined, the people have a high enthusiasm for production, the revolution is increasingly approaching national victory, large and medium-sized cities have been successively recovered, and the sales of grain and various raw materials (such as cotton, peanuts, fur, pig bristles, etc.) have increased. The unfavorable conditions are: insufficient labor and animal power, lack of fertilizer and farm implements, some middle peasants still have concerns about getting rich through production, the number and quality of Party and government cadres are low due to the large-scale transfer of personnel, and severe spring famine in some areas. We must give full play to the favorable conditions, overcome the unfavorable conditions, mobilize and organize people of all classes to strive to complete the spring plowing, and truly increase agricultural production by an inch on the existing basis.

    To this end, in addition to implementing the agricultural production plan and technical improvement instructions issued by the North China People's Government, all localities must also solve the following problems:

    (1) Universally publicize the idea of ​​developing production and getting rich through labor, overcome various concerns that hinder production (such as fear of "cutting leeks," fear of "sticking out," fear of "heavy burdens," and the idleness of hooliganism, etc.). Individual land property shall not be violated, encourage labor, criticize laziness, labor is glorious, and resolutely reform hooligans.

    (2) According to the principles of voluntariness and equivalence, organize the scattered and individual small peasant producers under necessary and possible conditions, and absorb a large number of women and children to participate in production. Under necessary and possible conditions, supply and marketing cooperatives should also be organized so that industrial and agricultural products and urban and rural exchanges can be connected through supply and marketing cooperatives, and small producers can be gradually combined with the state-owned economy, so that agricultural and industrial production can be developed smoothly, and the state-owned economy has the strength to fight against all kinds of speculation and manipulation that undermine the new democratic economy, thereby ensuring the victory of the new democratic economic construction.

    (3) Implement various correct policies for developing production:

    (A) After the land ownership certificates are issued, the ownership of land property of all classes in the rural areas after the land reform should be effectively protected and shall not be violated.

    (B) Implement the new agricultural tax regulations.

    (C) Strive for fairness and reasonableness in joining the army and participating in the war in order to save manpower; use manpower without violating farming seasons; and distribute substitute farming reasonably.

    (D) Provide loans to all those in rural areas who are actively engaged in production to solve the difficulties of the working people in production (such as purchasing production tools, buying draft animals, etc.), with borrowing and repayment, and oppose the idea of ​​bestowing favors.

    (E) Implement production incentive policies, breed livestock, cultivate intensively, select improved varieties, reclaim wasteland, build water conservancy projects, reward labor heroes and model workers, reward the development of sideline occupations, and reward the improvement of various technologies in agricultural production.

    (F) Strengthen production education and popularize agricultural production knowledge.

    (G) Promote the large-scale production of commodities, grains, and cash crops to help the economic construction of cities and exchange for daily necessities. Cities should plan to produce the daily necessities needed by farmers. The countryside supplies cities with grain and industrial raw materials, so as to combine urban and rural areas and combine workers and peasants.

    Spring plowing has begun. Mobilize quickly and strive to complete the spring plowing task and win the victory on the agricultural production front in 1949.

　　中共中央华北局
  　关于开展农业生产指示
    （一九四九年三月）
    开展大生产运动，中央局在去年秋季结束土改时就指出过是今后压倒一切的中心工作。现春耕已经开始，各级党委目前应即在去年冬季生产的基础上，以春耕为中心，加以领导，开展农业生产运动。
    今年我区发展农业生产的有利条件是：土地已经彻底平分，发过土地证，地权已经确定，人民生产情绪很高，革命日益迫近全国胜利，大中城市相继收复，粮食和各种原料品（如棉花、花生、皮毛、猪鬃等）的销路增加等。不利条件是：劳力、畜力不足，肥料、农具缺乏，部分中农对生产致富仍有顾虑，党政干部由于大批调出，以致数量少，质量弱，及不少地区春荒严重等。必须充分发挥有利条件，克服不利条件，动员组织各阶层人民，为完成春耕而努力，真正做到在现有基础上，把农业生产提高一寸。
    为此，各地除按华北人民政府所颁布的农业生产计划与改良技术指示执行外，还须解决以下问题：
    （一）普遍地宣传发展生产，劳动致富的观点，克服障碍生产的各种顾虑（如怕“割韭菜”，怕“冒尖”，怕“负担重”和不事生产的二流子思想等），个人土地财产不得侵犯，鼓励劳动，批评懒惰，劳动是光荣的，坚决改造二流子。
    （二）把分散的、个体的农民小生产者，根据自愿与等价的原则，在必须与可能的条件下，组织起来，大量吸收妇女、儿童参加生产。在必需与可能的条件下，还应组织供销合作社，以便经过供销合作社，沟通工业品与农业品、城市与乡村的交换，逐渐地把小生产者与国营经济结合起来，使农工业生产都能得到顺畅的发展，使国营经济有力量去同各种破坏新民主主义经济的投机操纵作斗争，从而保证新民主主义经济建设的胜利。
    （三）执行正确的发展生产的各种政策：
    （甲）在土地证发过后，应确实保护土地改革后农村各阶层土地财产的所有权，不得侵犯。
    （乙）贯彻新农业税税则。
    （丙）参军、参战力求公平合理，以便节省民力；使用民力，不违农时；代耕必须合理分配。
    （丁）贷款给农村中一切积极从事生产的人，解决劳动人民生产中的困难（如添置生产工具，购买耕畜等），有借有还，反对恩赐观点。
    （戊）实行生产奖励政策，繁殖牲畜，精耕细作，选择优良品种，开荒，兴修水利，奖励劳动英雄与模范工作者，奖励发展副业，奖励提高农业生产上的各种技术。
    （己）如强生产教育，普及农业生产知识。
    （庚）提倡大量生产商品、粮食与经济作物，以帮助城市的经济建设，并换得日用必需品。城市应有计划地生产农民所需要的日用必需品。乡村供给城市以粮食和工业原料品，做到城乡相结合，工农相结合。
    春耕已经开始，迅速动员起来，为完成春耕任务与争取一九四九年农业生产战线上的胜利而奋斗。
