　　Battle-Hardened Women Heroes
　　Introduction to the Northwest Women's Delegation

　　The Northwest Women's Delegation emerged from the women's mass movement in the Northwest Liberated Areas. They, together with the broad masses of women in the Northwest, experienced the three revolutionary periods of the Soviet Land Revolution, the War of Resistance Against Japan, and the People's Liberation War. On the extremely backward social and economic foundation of the Northwest, they broke free from heavy feudal traditions, overcame unparalleled difficulties, enthusiastically supported the revolutionary war, and actively participated in various constructions of the Northwest Liberated Areas.

　　When Hu Zongnan's bandit troops attacked the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Liberated Area in 1946, all the women in the Northwest fully supported the Northwest People's Liberation Army. 750,000 women in the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Liberated Area saved on food and clothing, endured hunger, and supported the front lines. In the first half of 1948, they contributed 930,000 pairs of military shoes, sewed 34,000 sets of military uniforms, and 10,000 quilts. In the Shanxi-Chahar-Hebei Liberated Area, just the Northwest Shanxi region, 550,000 women made 890,000 pairs of military shoes, 18,000 shoe soles, 135,000 pairs of single trousers, 136,000 quilts, and 253,000 pairs of military socks in the past year alone. The number of military shoes alone exceeded three times the total number of shoes made by women in the four years from 1939 to 1943. Not only that, wherever the People's Liberation Army went, they ground military grain, delivered tea, took care of the wounded soldiers, washed and mended cotton clothes, stood guard, sent messages, and participated in the logistics work on both sides, becoming good assistants to the People's Liberation Army. When Hu's bandits attacked the Northwest in June of the year before last, the Linchi Wounded Soldiers Hospital could not be transferred in time. More than 1,000 wounded soldiers were scattered in Baima Village, which had only 800 households, with an average of one to two wounded soldiers cared for by each household. The women did their best to feed them, look after their wounds, and take care of their needs until they were completely healed. The women treated the wounded soldiers of the People's Liberation Army like their own relatives. Women in the breastfeeding period in Baode Village took turns squeezing their own milk to feed the wounded soldiers who could not eat, saving their lives. When they faced the enemy, they were unyielding and unwavering. Liu Guiying (Grandma Liu), a textile heroine in the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region, was buried alive by bandits. Liu Hulan, a female hero in Shanxi-Suiyuan, was arrested by Chiang's bandits. With the spirit of "neither yielding to coercion nor being moved by money," she bravely sacrificed herself. Wang Daniu, a woman from Shangguolin in Wenxi, Southern Shanxi, was a Communist Party member who led women in the struggle against traitors and bullies. When Hu Zongnan's bandit troops attacked Southern Shanxi, a landlord informed on her. She was captured by Hu's bandits, who used severe torture, pouring cold water into her nose to force her to reveal military secrets, but she never said a word from beginning to end, and finally she was heroically sacrificed by Hu's bandits who nailed her to the wall with iron prongs. In the Northwest Women's Delegation, there are four comrades who personally led the masses in emptying the villages and receiving wounded soldiers during Hu's bandit attacks, and participated in supporting the front lines, and Comrade Liu is particularly exemplary.

　　With the great victory of the Northwest People's Liberation Army, which annihilated a large number of Hu's bandit troops, and the recovery of the original Hu areas, greatly expanding the liberated areas, the urban and rural women in the new and old liberated areas, together with the people of the Northwest, on the one hand, continued to actively support the war as in the past, and on the other hand, vigorously participated in various construction works to rebuild their homes. Their contribution to the production sector is particularly significant. The textile industry in the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Liberated Area has been carefully managed for many years, developing from hand-braided thread to hand-spun thread, and expanding from individual areas to the entire area. Before Hu's bandits attacked Yan'an, the cloth woven by women themselves was able to provide one-third of the cloth needed by the military and civilians in the entire area. After Hu's bandits carried out armed parades, tools were destroyed, and cotton fields were ruined. After the People's Liberation Army recovered the area, the People's Government vigorously restored the civilian textile industry. This spring, the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region Government organized 500,000 jin of cotton to be distributed to the countryside and loaned to the masses. The masses also bought 500,000 jin of cotton themselves and remade a part of the textile tools. In the three districts of Yongping in Shaanxi Yan'an and the seventh district of Ningxia Northwest, 728 new spinning wheels were made, so civilian cloth was gradually increased. In the Sui, Shaanxi, Yan'an, and Ningxia regions, from November 1947 to July 1948, 320,000 bolts of cloth had been produced, restoring 50% to 60% of the pre-war level (before Hu Zongnan's bandit troops attacked, the annual output of cloth in these two regions was 72,000 bolts). In terms of agricultural production, there have also been significant achievements. In the Shanxi-Suiyuan Liberated Area in 1948, women participating in agricultural production accounted for about 30% to 40% of the female labor force during the spring plowing, about 50% to 70% during the summer hoeing, and even increased to about 90% during the autumn harvest. Therefore, Shanxi-Suiyuan's agricultural production not only did not suffer losses due to the large number of male farmers supporting the Sui-Meng and Central Shanxi campaigns, but on the contrary, made last year's autumn harvest more suitable for the farming season and ended earlier. Some areas were even able to extract more male labor to carry out autumn plowing, deep plowing and meticulous cultivation. The women of Shanxi-Suiyuan, following in the footsteps of the sisters in the old areas, poured into the production front in large numbers, making considerable contributions. In this widespread large-scale production movement, many labor heroes and production models have emerged, especially the families of revolutionary soldiers, who have made even greater achievements in this regard. Comrades Zhang Qiulin and Liu Jinying of the Northwest Women's Delegation are labor heroes who have been famous in the Northwest Liberated Areas for many years. They are typical representatives of rural working women in the Northwest.

　　Under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, the women of the Northwest have undergone more than ten years of revolutionary training. Especially after the land reform, their political consciousness has been further improved, and their past state of oppressed slavery has been fundamentally changed. Their status in society and in the family has been greatly improved. Many rural working women have participated in the work of managing the country and social construction, becoming the masters of the new China. In the party, government, and military departments at the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region level, there are 368 female cadres. There are 229 female cadres working in the Northwest Field Army. In the various agencies above the district level in the Shanxi-Suiyuan Liberated Area, there are 615 female cadres. In the village-level people's representative conferences, female representatives account for about 15% of the number of representatives. Generally, they can closely contact the masses, work actively and enthusiastically, and are loved by the masses. Some women have also participated in childcare work and maternal and child health work, and have achieved remarkable results. Among the 32 representatives from the Northwest, there are as many as six who started participating in work since the Soviet Land Revolution. At the same time, there are also new cadres who have emerged after the land reform. Comrade Yuan Xiuying in our delegation is an activist who has turned over a new leaf. Therefore, the members of the Northwest Women's Delegation include various types of people: female cadres who have been tempered in the Soviet Land Revolution in Northern Shaanxi, female soldiers who have gone through the 25,000-mile Long March and have consistently followed the army in the north and south, female revolutionary professionals who have struggled hard in enemy prisons for many years, cadres who have been engaged in women's work for a long time, women heroes from Hui and Mongolian ethnic minorities, women heroes on the textile cooperation and agricultural production fronts, model childcare workers, model rural maternal and child workers, and rural women activists who have just grown up in the land reform. They come from the masses and attend the conference with the voices of the masses. They will accuse Hu Zongnan's bandit troops of their heinous crimes in invading the Northwest Liberated Area at the National Women's Congress, and demand that war criminals be severely punished. Luo Yufang, deputy director of the Yan'an Municipal Women's Federation, specially ran to Lu Zhiliang to say: "Go and accuse those devils and grandchildren. We demand that when Hu Zongnan is captured in the future, he will be sent to Yan'an and handed over to us for public trial." They demand that Chairman Mao Zedong's eight peace conditions be fully implemented and that the entire Northwest and China be completely liberated. They hope that the women representatives from various liberated areas can fully exchange experiences in mobilizing women to participate in production and various social constructions, rebuild the Northwest, and welcome the national victory.

　　久经锻炼的妇女英雄们
    西北妇女代表团介绍
    西北妇女代表团，是从西北解放区妇女群众运动中涌现出来的，她们和西北广大妇女在一起，经历了苏维埃土地革命，抗日战争和人民解放战争的三个革命时期，在西北极端落后的社会、经济基础上，挣脱了重重的封建传统，克服了无比的困难，热烈支援了革命战争，积极参加了西北解放区的各种建设。
    当一九四六年胡宗南匪军进攻陕甘宁解放区的时候，全西北妇女全力支援了西北人民解放军，陕甘宁解放区七十五万妇女，节衣缩食，忍饥挨饿，支援前线，于一九四八年上半年献出了军鞋九十三万双，缝制了军衣三万四千套，棉被一万条。晋区解放区只晋西北地区，五十五万妇女在去年一年中做了军鞋八十九万双，鞋底一万八千双，单裤十三万五千余条，棉被十三万六千余床，军袜二十五万三千双，仅军鞋一项，即超过一九三九年到一九四三年四年中妇女制鞋总数的三倍之多。不仅这样，解放军走到那里，她们就在那里磨军粮，送茶水，看护伤兵，洗补棉衣，放哨站岗，送信联络，参加双方的勤务工作，成为人民解放军的好助手。前年六月胡匪进攻西北时，临池伤兵医院不及转移，一千余伤员，分散在仅有八百户的白马村里，平均一户养护一个至两个伤员，妇女们尽心尽力，喂饭，看伤口，倒屎倒尿，直到伤完全好为止。妇女们对待人民解放军的伤员，和自己的亲人一样，保德村哺乳期妇轮流挤自己的奶，喂无法进食的伤员，挽救了伤员的生命。当她们面对着敌人的时候，不屈不挠，毫不动摇。陕甘宁边区纺织英雄刘桂英（刘老婆）被匪活埋，晋绥女英雄刘胡兰被蒋匪逮捕，以“威武不能屈，金钱不能移”的精神，慷慨就义。晋南闻喜上郭林妇女王大牛，她是共产党员，领导妇女进行反奸霸斗争，胡宗南匪军进攻晋南时，地主告密，被胡匪捉住，敌人用严刑拷打，从鼻子里灌凉水，逼她暴露军情，但她自始至终没有讲出半个字，最后终于被胡匪用铁氏把在钉在墙上而英勇牺牲了。在西北妇女代表团里，在胡匪进攻时，曾经亲自领导群众空室清野招待受伤伤员，参加支前工作的就有四位，而刘同志尤为典范。
    随着西北人民解放军的伟大胜利，大量歼灭了胡匪全部的部队，光复了原有的胡区，大大扩展了解放区，于是新老解放区的城乡妇女们，又和西北人民在一起，一面和过去同样地积极地支援战争，另一方面又大力参加各种建设工作，重建家园。对生产事业的贡献，尤为巨大。陕甘宁解放区的纺织业是经过多年苦心经营，从手编线发展到手纺线，从个别地区扩大到整个地区，在胡匪进攻延安以前，妇女自纺自织的布匹，已能自给全区军民所需布匹的三分之一，等到胡匪武装大游行了以后，工具破坏，棉田摧毁，当人民解放军光复以后，人民政府大力恢复民间纺织业，今春陕甘宁边区政府组织了五十万斤棉花下乡，贷给群众，群众又自买了棉花五十万斤、重制了一部分纺织工具、陕延属永坪等三区及宁下、西北七区，新制了纺草七百二十八架，因此民间布匹得以逐渐增加。绥陕延宁两地区，从一九四七年十一月到一九四八年七月，已产布匹三十二万匹，恢复战前水平百分之五十到六十（胡宗南匪军进攻前该两区年产布匹七万二千匹。）在农业生产方面，也有重大成就，一九四八年一年中，晋绥解放区参加农业生产的妇女，在春耕中约占妇女劳动力的百分之三十到四十，在夏锄中约占百分之五十到七十，在秋收中竟增至百分之九十左右。因此，使晋绥的农业生产不仅没有因大批男农民支援绥蒙及晋中两大战役而受到损失，相反地，使去年的秋收更适合农时，更结束得早。甚至有些地区尚能抽出更多的男子劳动力，进行秋耕，深耕细作。晋绥妇女，步着老区姊妹的后尘，大量涌入了生产战线，贡献颇大。在这样普遍的大生产运动中，涌现了很多劳动英雄，生产模范，尤其是革命军人家属，在这方面的成就更大。西北妇女代表团里张秋林、刘金英等同志，就是多年来驰名西北解放区的劳动英雄，她们已是西北农村劳动妇女的典型代表。
    西北妇女，在中国共产党的领导之下，经过了十余年来革命的锻炼，特别是土地改革以后，更加提高了政治觉悟，根本改变了过去受压迫的奴隶状态，在社会上，在家庭里，其地位大大的提高了，很多农村劳动妇女，参加了管理国家的工作，社会建设工作，成为新中国的主人。在陕甘宁边区一级的党政军各部门中，就有妇女干部三百六十八人，在西北野战军工作的女干部有二百二十九人，在晋绥解放区区级以上的各种机关中，就有妇女干部六百十五人，在村级人民代表会中，女代表约占代表人数百分之十五，一般地都能密切联系群众，积极热烈的工作，得到群众的爱戴。还有些妇女参加了儿童保育工作，妇婴卫生工作，都有着显著的成绩；在西北三十二位代表中，从苏维埃土地革命就开始参加工作的就有六位之多，同时也有土改后涌现出来的新干部，我们代表团中袁秀英同志就是翻身的积极分子。所以西北妇女代表团的成员就包含着各种不同类型的人物：有从陕北苏维埃土地革命中锻炼出来的女干部，有经过二万五千里长征，一贯随着军队南征北战的女战士，有多年来在敌人监狱中艰苦奋斗的女革命职业者，有长期从事妇女工作的干部，还有回蒙少数民族，有纺织合作及农业生产战线上的女英雄，有模范保育工作者，有农村妇婴模范工作者，有土改中刚生长起来的农村妇女积极分子，她们从群众中来，带着群众的心声出席大会，她们要在全国妇女代表大会上，控告胡宗南匪军侵占西北解放区的滔天罪行，要求严厉地惩办战争罪犯。延安市妇联副主任罗玉芳特地跑去找路志亮同志说：“去控诉那些鬼子孙，我们要求将来把胡宗南捉到，送到延安，交给我们公审”。她们要求，完全实现毛泽东主席的八项和平条件，完全解放全西北、全中国。她们希望各解放区妇女代表能充分交换发动妇女参加生产及各种社会建设的经验，重建西北，迎接全国胜利。
