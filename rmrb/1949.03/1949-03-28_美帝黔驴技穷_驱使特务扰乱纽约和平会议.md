　　American Imperialism is at its Wit's End
  　Driving Special Agents to Disrupt the New York Peace Conference
    [Xinhua News Agency, Peiping, 27th] American imperialism, terrified by the great force of the world's people demanding peace, is painstakingly working to sabotage the New York World Peace Conference. Hours before the conference opened on the 25th, American special agents organized a so-called "protest demonstration" outside the venue, and threatened to organize such "demonstrations" every day during the conference. American special agents even began tailing representatives planning to attend the conference in Britain long ago. Although British law prohibits foreigners from conducting police activities on British territory, this action by American special agents has been approved by the British Home Office. American special agents also demanded samples of the yet-to-be-published book "Science Versus War" by the famous physicist Bernal from British publishers. Bernal was, in fact, a British representative who was unable to attend the New York Peace Conference because the US State Department refused to grant him a visa. The Minister of Justice of the Provisional Democratic Government of Greece, Bofilokinis, who was invited to attend the New York Peace Conference, was also unable to attend because the US State Department refused to issue him a visa.

　　美帝黔驴技穷
  　驱使特务扰乱纽约和平会议
    【新华社北平二十七日电】为世界人民要求和平的伟大力量所震恐的美帝国主义，正处心积虑地进行破坏纽约世界和平大会的工作。在二十五日大会开幕前数小时，美国特务在会场外组织了所谓“抗议示威”，并扬言将在大会开会期间每天组织这样的“示威”。美国特务甚至在很久以前即在英国对拟出席大会的代表钉梢。虽然英国法律禁止外国人在英国领土上进行警察活动，美国特务的这种行动却得到英国内政部的认可。美国特务并向英国出版商要索尚未出版的著名物理学家贝奈尔所著“科学反对战争”一书的样本，而贝奈尔正是为美国国务院拒绝给予签证因而不能参加纽约和平大会的英国代表。被邀参加纽约和平大会的希腊临时人民民主政府司法部长玻非罗金尼斯也因为美国国务院拒发签证而未能成行。
