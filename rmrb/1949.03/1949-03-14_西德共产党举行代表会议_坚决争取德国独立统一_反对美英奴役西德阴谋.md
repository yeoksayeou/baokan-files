Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 12th: TASS reports: The First Delegates' Meeting of the West German Communist Party opened on March 5th in Solingen (southeast of Dusseldorf). Over a thousand delegates and guests attended. Max Reimann delivered a speech to the meeting, stating: If the peace-loving forces fight resolutely and bravely, a third world war can be avoided; this struggle is the task of the German people, and first and foremost, the entire German working class. As a result of the "Trusteeship Law," West Germany's coal mines and steel industry will once again revert to the hands of German monopoly capitalists. Reimann emphasized: The Ruhr Statute signifies the economic and political annexation of the Ruhr. The "Basic Law" being discussed in Bonn is merely a fig leaf for the occupation statutes. The "Joint Export-Import Agency" is doing everything possible to hinder the development of West German manufacturing. As a result, the ranks of the unemployed in West Germany are constantly increasing. Reimann continued: The struggle for an independent, unified, and democratic republic is not only in the interests of the working class but also in the interests of the entire German nation. The Communist Party calls on the German people to fight together with it to achieve this goal, to strive for a just peace treaty, the withdrawal of occupying forces, and the abolition of the Export-Import Agency, and to oppose the Ruhr Statute and the occupation statutes. In this struggle, the German people enjoy the support of all democratic forces worldwide, especially the Soviet Union.
    After a lively discussion of Max Reimann's report, the delegates' meeting unanimously passed a resolution regarding the memorandum from the military governors to the Bonn "Parliamentary Council," strongly denouncing the deceptive nature of the military governments regarding the so-called independence of the West German alliance. It pointed out that the future West German state established in accordance with this "memorandum" would be ruled along colonial lines. The German Communist Party calls on all patriotic Germans to unite to save the most precious thing they have lost: German unity and independence.
    The Solingen Party Congress of the German Communist Party sent a congratulatory telegram to the German Socialist Unity Party and received a congratulatory telegram from the German Socialist Unity Party signed by Pieck and Grotewohl.
    Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 12th: TASS reports: Leipzig recently held a grand rally for unity, democracy, and peace hosted by the German People's Council on March 7th. Many representatives from the West German occupation zone attended. Pieck, Professor Kassner, Nuschke, as well as the chairman of the German National Democratic Party, Holz, and the chairman of the Democratic Farmers' Party, Goldenbaum, delivered speeches to the congress.
    The congress unanimously passed a resolution demanding: a return to the Potsdam Agreement, a cessation of anti-democratic and anti-Soviet slander, and striving to achieve peace and German unity.

　　西德共产党举行代表会议
    坚决争取德国独立统一
  　反对美英奴役西德阴谋
    【新华社陕北十二日电】塔斯社讯：西德共产党第一次代表会议三月五日在索灵根（杜塞尔多夫东南）开幕。到会的有代表和来宾共千余人。马克思·雷曼向会议发表演说，他说：如果爱好和平的力量坚决勇敢地战斗，第三次世界大战便能避免，这个斗争是德国人民，首先是整个德国工人阶级的任务。由于“托管法”的结果，西德的煤矿和钢铁工业会再度转到德国垄断资本家的手里。雷曼强调：鲁尔法规意味着在经济上和政治上并吞鲁尔。波恩所讨论的“根本法”，只是占领法规的遮羞物而已。“联合进出口局”正尽一切可能来阻止西德制造工业的发展。其结果，就是西德失业队伍的不断增加。雷曼继称：争取独立统一民主共和国的斗争，不止是合乎工人阶级的利益，它同时也合乎整个德国民族的利益的。共产党号召德国人民和它一起进行斗争，争取达到这个目的，争取公正的和约、撤退占领军和取消进出口局，反对鲁尔法规和占领法规。在这个斗争中，德国人民享有全世界一切民主力量的支持，特别是苏联的支持。
    代表会议在生动地讨论了马克思·雷曼的报告以后，一致通过了关于军事总督们致波恩“议会委员会”的备忘录的决议。力斥各军政府关于所谓西德联盟的独立的欺骗性。并指出，依照这一“备忘录”建立的未来的西德国家，将按照殖民地的路线来统治。德国共产党号召一切爱国的德国人，必须联合起来，去挽救最宝贵的、他们已经失去了的德国的统一和独立。
    德国共产党索灵根党代表大会曾电德国统一社会党致敬，并接到由皮克与格罗提渥签名的德国统一社会党的贺电。
    【新华社陕北十二日电】塔斯社讯：莱比锡顷于三月七日举行了德国人民委员会所主持的统一民主和平盛大集会。德国西占区很多代表都来参加。皮克、卡斯纳教授、努舍克以及德国国民民主党主席霍茨，民主党民党主席果尔登豪姆曾向大会发表演说。
    大会一致通过决议，要求：回到波茨坦协议，停止反民主和反苏的诽谤，争取达到和平和德国的统一。
