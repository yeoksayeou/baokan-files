The responsible comrade of the Ping City Public Security Bureau stated to our reporter: Recently, the bureau has received a large number of letters accusing bandits and special agents of their crimes. The masses unanimously demand that the government severely punish Kuomintang bandit and special agent elements who endanger the people and disrupt social order. The bureau welcomes the citizens' enthusiastic assistance to the government in reporting bandits and special agents, and has achieved great results from this. It hopes to continue to cooperate closely with the government to achieve the goal of thoroughly eliminating bandits and special agents, stabilizing social order, and protecting the interests of the masses. However, in some of the letters received by the bureau, although the materials are good, they are not specific enough, making it impossible to further understand them in depth. The bureau hopes that all letters reporting bandits and special agents will include the real name and detailed address for contact purposes. The bureau will absolutely keep them confidential. Those who have made meritorious contributions in reporting bandits and special agents will be rewarded. Kuomintang bandit and special agent elements who have already registered to turn over a new leaf or have shown meritorious service will be treated leniently depending on the actual situation. Those who conceal their identities, refuse to register and surrender, persist in their evil ways, and continue to conspire to undermine the interests of the people will be arrested and severely punished according to law.

  　人民检举匪特获得成效
    对继续作恶匪特将予严惩
    【本报讯】北平市人民政府公安局负责同志对本报记者发表谈话称：该局近日接获大批控诉匪特罪行之函件，群众一致要求政府严惩危害人民、破坏社会秩序之国民党匪特分子，该局对市民踊跃协助政府检举匪特之举动，深表欢迎，且由此获得很大成效，并望继续与政府密切合作，以达成彻底肃清匪特，安定社会秩序保卫群众利益之目的。惟在该局所收到函件中的一部份，材料虽好，但因不够具体，以致无从进一步作深入了解。该局希望凡属检举匪特之函件，均注以真实姓名及详细住址，以便联系，该局绝对代守秘密。检举匪特有功者，并将予以奖励。对国民党匪特分子，凡已登记自新悔过或已有将功赎罪表现者，将视现实情况予以宽大处理；对隐匿不登记投案，怙恶不悛，继续阴谋破坏人民利益之死心踏地的匪特分子，决将依法拘捕严惩。
