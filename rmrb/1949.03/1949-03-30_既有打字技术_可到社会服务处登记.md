　　Has Typing Skills?
    Register at the Social Services Office
    Ms. Gao Ping: It is very good that you are determined to serve the people after losing your job and leaving school. Of course, you can also register for the training class of the Health Department of the North China People's Government. But since you have typing skills, you can register at the Social Services Office at Damochang, Qianmenwai. They can help you find a job. Please also provide your mailing address.

　　既有打字技术
    可到社会服务处登记
    高萍女士：你失业失学后愿决心为人民服务，这是很好的，不过你愿投考华北人民政府卫生部训练班，当然也可以去报名考试。但你个人会打字技术，你可到前门外打磨厂社会服务处进行登记，他们可以帮助你找职业。并请告知你的通讯地址。
