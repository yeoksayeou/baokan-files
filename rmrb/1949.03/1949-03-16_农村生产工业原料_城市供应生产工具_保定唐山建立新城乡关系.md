Rural Areas Produce Industrial Raw Materials
　　Cities Supply Production Tools
    Baoding and Tangshan Establish New Urban-Rural Relationship
    [Jizhong Dispatch] After the liberation of Baoding City, under the unified leadership of the Party, nearby rural areas supplied the city dwellers and industrial production with food and industrial raw materials. At the same time, the city supplied the nearby rural areas with industrial products necessary for people's lives and production, beginning to establish a new economic relationship of mutual integration and development between urban and rural areas.

    Before the liberation of Baoding City, it was always a market where imperialist and bureaucratic comprador capitalists plundered farmers' grain, cotton, and other industrial raw materials with inferior commodities. The Kuomintang reactionaries used the city to attack the countryside and implement blockades against rural areas, causing the city to lose its reliance on the countryside, leading to industrial bankruptcy and worker unemployment. The ironware industry in Baoding City decreased from more than 70 firms to 42, and even those were struggling to survive. The apprentices at Fuhexing Iron Factory decreased from more than 30 to only three.

    Since the liberation of Baoding City, the People's Government has actively carried out various tasks to restore and initially develop urban construction. First, it supplied a large amount of raw materials for urban industrial production and food. According to statistics from December of last year to February 22nd of this year, the following were imported from rural areas to the city: 3.98 million jin of grain; 450,000 jin of cotton, flax seeds, and peanut kernels; and more than 60,000 jin of scrap iron. On the other hand, workers in Baoding City have manufactured 37 waterwheels, 7 textile machines, 3 wind bows, 450 pots, 1,550 jin of iron nails, as well as 6,804 pieces of agricultural tools such as iron picks, saw blades, hoes, and sickles; and 211,395 jin of fertilizer such as bean cake, to supply the production needs of farmers in nearby areas, which greatly contributes to this year's great production movement. Due to the fair prices of industrial products, liberated peasants from all over are bringing their grain, cotton, peanuts, fruits, etc., to Baoding City to exchange for necessities.

    [Tangshan Dispatch] The Tangshan Ordnance Repair Shop has been converted into an iron factory after being taken over by us, preparing to manufacture agricultural tools. Before the liberation of Tangshan City, Wang Chunzheng, the director of the Ordnance Repair Shop, carried away the wages of more than 150 people for three months and fled. The factory was completely shut down on December 1st as a result, and most of the workers became unemployed, leaving only more than 80 people. When the Chiang bandits collapsed, the workers organized themselves to protect all the machinery and equipment in the factory with weapons and handed them over intact to the democratic government. On the third day after liberation, more than 80 workers started all the machines. The democratic government promptly issued each person more than 100,000 to 600,000 Changcheng coupons to subsidize them. Their work enthusiasm is very high, and production efficiency has reached the previous level. In order to further serve the people and develop production, the factory has decided to change its name to Tangshan Iron Factory, preparing to manufacture a large number of agricultural tools to supply the needs of farmers in various places for the great production. Currently, it plans to manufacture a batch of looms, etc. (Note: The Tangshan Ordnance Repair Shop was established in the 32nd year of the Republic of China. It was divided into eight factories internally. During the Kuomintang rule, it specialized in manufacturing various guns, cannons, and various machines.)

### 农村生产工业原料　城市供应生产工具  保定唐山建立新城乡关系

　　农村生产工业原料
  　城市供应生产工具
    保定唐山建立新城乡关系
    【冀中电】保定市解放后，在党的统一领导下，附近乡村以食粮及工业原料供给了市民和工业生产的需要；同时又以城市的工业品供给了附近地区农民生活生产必要的资料，开始树立城市与农村互相结合发展的新的经济关系。
    保定市在解放前，始终是帝国主义及官僚买办资本主义用低劣的商品，掠夺农民的粮食棉花等工业原料的市场。国民党反动派用城市进攻农村和实行封锁农村的结果，使城市失掉了农村的依托，造成工业破产，工人失业。保定全市的铁货业，由七十多家减少到四十二家，并都是勉强维持；福和兴铁工厂的徒工由三十多人减少到只剩了三个人。
    从保定市解放后，人民政府积极进行了各种恢复和初步发展城市建设工作。首先大量供给了城市工业生产原料及食粮，从去年十二月到今年二月二十二日的统计，由农村输入到城市的计有：粮食三百九十八万斤；棉麻籽、花生仁共四十五万斤；碎铁六万多斤。另一方面保市的工人已经制造出水车三十七架、纺织机七架、风弓三架、锅四百五十口、铁钉一千五百五十斤，另外还有铁镐、锯条、锄、镰等农具六千八百零四件；豆饼等肥料二十一万一千三百九十五斤，供给了附近地区农民生产的需要，这就大大有助于今年的大生产运动。由于工业品价格公道，各地翻身农民，正以自己的粮食、棉花、花生、水果等，运到保市，以换回必需品。
    【唐山电】唐山修械所为我接收后，已改为铁工厂，准备制造农具。唐市解放前，修械所所长王纯正将全厂一百五十余人三个月的工资携带逃跑，该厂于十二月一日遂全部停工，因此工人大半失业，只剩八十余人。蒋匪溃退时，工人们组织起来武装保护了工厂里的一切机器设备，完好地移交给民主政府。在解放后第三天八十余工人就全部开动了机器，民主政府及时发给每人十多万至六十万元长城券，补助他们，工作情绪很高，生产效率已达到以往水平。该厂今后为更进一步为人民服务及发展生产起见，已决定改为唐山铁工厂，准备制造大批农具，以供给各地农民大生产之需要。目前正拟制造一批织布机等。（按唐山修械所成立于民国三十二年，内部共分八厂，国民党统治时，专造各种枪炮及各种机器。）
