[Jizhong News] The Jizhong Administrative Office, in order to specifically implement the breeding and promotion tasks proposed at the agricultural conference in this year's great production movement, convened a breeding farm director conference on February 12th. The conference focused on studying the key points and methods of promotion work for this spring, and resolutions were made on all tasks. 1. Establish a promotion network before the vernal equinox, focusing on the prevention and control of pests (mainly jujube leaf beetles and pear psyllids). In areas with a tradition of growing barley, promote barley seed soaking. The Eighth Administrative Region encourages burning or chopping corn stalks to prevent corn borers from pupating, and carry out spring afforestation. 2. Before Grain Rain, promote millet and sorghum seed soaking and livestock mating. 3. Before the Beginning of Summer, promote weeding wheat to prevent jaundice, and promote large ridge cultivation for cotton planting and control pear and jujube leaf beetles. 4. Before the Lesser Fullness: remove wheat loose smut and wheat nematode disease (i.e., wheat gall). Control aphids on cotton and beans, guide cotton thinning and setting seedlings, collect elm seeds, and sow tree seedlings, and continue livestock mating. To complete the above tasks, all farms must complete various preparatory work before the vernal equinox. First, continue to complete seed adjustment and seed disinfection. Improved varieties of cotton and grain should be distributed to the masses before Qingming Festival. Agricultural medicines should be appropriately distributed to county farms, repair agricultural tools, prepare fertilizers, improve the organization, adjust cadres, and establish and improve various systems. Detailed records should be kept of the work. Breeding farms should establish agricultural management committees and strengthen business and political study.

On working methods: 1. For promotion work, it is necessary to conduct a survey of local farmers' planting habits in advance and promote according to the needs of farmers. Survey and summary work should also be done after the work is completed. 2. Participate in production meetings at all levels to introduce technology, and hold small and large-scale seminars and exhibitions for publicity (using fairs and temple fairs). Closely combine with administrative and economic departments to exchange information with each other. 3. The farm itself must focus on cooperating with the administration to establish a promotion network, mainly focusing on labor models, technical research groups, and good mutual aid teams. Continue to guide the good promotion households of last year, and comprehensively introduce them through key experiences. General promotion projects are mainly carried out through administrative mobilization of the masses and mobilization of all cadres. The farm should provide timely technical advice and promotion experience. 4. The promoted seeds should be appropriately concentrated, with different focuses according to the habits of different regions, and designated personnel should be responsible for timely guidance. However, for large-scale pest control, forces can be concentrated and used uniformly. Each farm should also plan to find enthusiastic agricultural technicians or mutual aid groups to set up agricultural situation reporters to reflect the agricultural situation in various places, so as to facilitate guidance work. 5. The breeding farm's leadership over the promotion farm focuses on grasping the breeding and promotion plan of the promotion farm, and providing timely technical and methodological guidance according to the season to realize the plan. Give full play to the role of the promotion farm, and each should determine a key promotion farm (Jian'guo in the Eighth Administrative Region, Ding County in the Ninth Administrative Region, and Jin County in the Eleventh Administrative Region) to strengthen leadership, learn from experience, guide other promotion farms, and provide the administration with a basis for guiding the technical improvement movement in the entire region. 6. Strengthen reporting work and introduce experience. The Agricultural Department of the Administrative Office introduces general technical methods and exchanges local experiences through newspapers according to the season; breeding farms and promotion farms should organize communication groups and assign personnel to be responsible for writing reports. 7. In order to complete a large amount of cotton planting this year and ensure cotton production, strengthen the promotion of cotton aphid control methods. Therefore, it is necessary to plan and organize sprayers and pesticides, focusing on cotton areas. When insects occur, the county farm will lend the sprayers to the masses in an organized manner, and teach the masses the preparation method of medicines and the use of sprayers. The farms should immediately repair damaged sprayers. According to this resolution, each breeding farm and promotion farm should conduct specific research according to the situation of its own region and formulate more specific methods, so as to achieve results in this year's technical work in the production movement.

　　冀中召开农场场长会议
    决大力改良农业技术
  　春季着重种籽消毒防除虫害
    【冀中讯】冀中行署为了在今年大生产运动中具体贯彻农场会议所提出的繁殖、推广任务，二月十二日召开繁殖场场长会议，着重对今年春季推广工作重点及工作方法等进行了研究，各项工作均获得决议。一、春分前要建立推广网，着重防除虫害（主要是枣步曲、梨狗子）。种大麦有习惯地区提倡大麦浸种，八分区提倡把棒子秸烧完，或铡碎，防止卷心虫变蛹，开展春季造林。二、谷雨前提倡谷子高粮浸种和交配牲口。三、立夏前提倡锄麦防黄疸，种棉花提倡耕大垄，治梨枣步曲。四、小满前：拔除小麦黑穗病，及线虫病（即麦由子）。治棉、豆上的蚜虫，指导棉花间苗、定苗，收榆树籽，树秧播种，继续配交牲口。为完成以上任务，各场必须在春分前完成各项准备工作。首先继续完成种籽调剂和种籽消毒，棉、谷良种要在清明前发到群众手中，农业药品适当分配到县场，修理农具，预备肥料，并健全组织，调整干部，树立与健全各种制度，工作中要作详细记载，繁殖场建立农场管理委员会，并加强业务与政治学习。
    工作方法上：一、推广工作，事先必须对当地农民的种植习惯进行调查，根据农民需要去推广，工作完了也要作调查总结工作。二、参加各级生产会议，介绍技术，并召开小型大型的各种座谈展览宣传（利用集市庙会），和行政及经济部门密切结合，相互交换情况。三、农场本身必须有重点的配合行政建立推广网，主要是抓住劳动英模技术研究小组，好的互助组等。对去年好的推广户仍须继续领导，通过重点吸取经验，进行全面介绍。一般的推广项目，主要是通过行政发动群众和动员全体干部来作，农场及时提供技术意见与推广经验。四、推广的种籽要适当集中，根据不同地区的习惯有不同的重点，并确定专人负责及时指导。但对大规模的治虫，力量可以集中统一使用，各场并有计划的找热心农业技术的群众或互助组，设立农情报告员，反映各地农情，便于指导工作。五、繁殖场对推广场的领导，着重掌握推广场的繁殖与推广计划，并按季节及时在技术和工作方法上指导，以实现计划。充分发挥推广场的作用，各确定一重点推广场（八分区以建国、九分区以定县、十一分区以晋县推广场），加强领导，吸取经验，指导其他推广场，提供行政上作为指导全区技术改良运动的根据。六、加强报导工作，介绍经验。行署农业处通过报纸，按季节介绍一般技术方法和交流各地经验；繁殖场和推广场，要组织通讯小组，分工负责写报导。七、为完成今年大量种棉，保证棉产，加强棉蚜的防除方法的推广。因此要有计划的组织喷雾器和农药，重点放到棉区。喷雾器在虫子发生时，由县场有组织的借给群众，并教给群众药品的配制法和喷雾器的用法。坏的喷雾器，各场应即进行修理。根据这个决议，各繁殖场推广场要按照本地区情况具体研究，订出更具体的办法，务使今年的技术工作在生产运动中获得成绩。
