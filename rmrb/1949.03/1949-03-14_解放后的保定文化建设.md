Cultural Construction in Baoding After Liberation
    Jizhong Branch
    The social education and artistic work in Baoding City have achieved initial success after three months of development and construction. Under the leadership of the People's Education Center, 97 blackboard newspapers have been established throughout the city (excluding factories and schools). The current situation and policies have been publicized and explained to the citizens through blackboard newspapers. During the mass collection of public materials from the enemy and puppets, the exemplary deeds of merchants in 44 streets in the third district who voluntarily reported the enemy's hidden large guns were promptly reported, quickly spreading throughout the city and inspiring the citizens to hand over public property. Because the blackboard newspapers are connected to the masses, they have a large number of readers. According to statistics from 15th Street in the 5th District, each of the two blackboard newspapers in that street is read by no less than 100 people every day. The three large blackboard newspapers in front of the People's Education Center are often surrounded by seven or eight people. In order to provide timely materials for the blackboard newspapers, the People's Education Center publishes a People's Bulletin, which is issued every one to two days. Twenty-three issues have been published, mainly covering current affairs policies and local news. The library (more than 95,000 old and new books) and the museum exhibition hall, which belong to the People's Education Center, were vandalized when Chiang Kai-shek fled. After being reorganized, they have been open for more than two months. More than 500 new books, 51 kinds of magazines, and 8 kinds of newspapers have been added. The number of readers has increased from more than 10 people per day in the past to 40 to 50 people. From February 1st to 15th, the daily average was 70 to 80 people. In order to make it convenient for students and teachers to read, the library has set up a mobile library. Students and teachers can borrow books directly through the Municipal Youth Federation.
    In order to implement policies, the center held lectures on industrial and commercial policies and housing issues on February 17th. In addition, two amplification broadcasts were established, glass plates showing current affairs policies and local news were played before film screenings in cinemas, and mass inquiry boxes were added.
    In order to meet the needs of workers and poor citizens to further improve their political culture, the Municipal Education Bureau and the district and street governments, combined with the citizens' production, organized various forms of study groups, and established people's schools with a focus. According to statistics on January 25th, a total of eight people's schools have been established, with more than 300 people participating in the study, and a total of 43 study groups in various forms, with 468 people. The content of study in the people's schools mainly focuses on central work, current affairs, and cultural learning, while the study groups mainly focus on reading newspapers and literacy. The learning enthusiasm is very high. For example, in the people's school on 19th Street in the 5th District, the number of people participating in the study increased from 54 on the first day to 79 on the second day, and some even requested to learn abacus. In order to strengthen the management of the people's schools, the district and street cadres, teachers, and activists among the students organized a management committee for the people's schools.
    The education and transformation of old artists has also achieved considerable results. Under Chiang Kai-shek's rule, they suffered all kinds of oppression and humiliation. In order to maintain their livelihoods, they had to perform some feudal, superstitious, and obscene ballads and local operas. In order to change their direction of development and make them people's art, the Municipal Education Bureau held a forum for old artists and a forum for female artists on December 22nd last year, explaining the status of old artists under the democratic regime and pointing out the programs that should be performed in the future. Many artists accused Chiang Kai-shek of the pain he inflicted on them. Cai Baoguang's self-compiled new ballad about Liu Huanan's persecution of the people is very popular. The old theaters were helped to overcome management problems, and the exploitation of the backstage by the front desk, managers, and actors was corrected, so that the actors' lives gradually improved. The old scripts were also reviewed and rewritten. Those who spread feudal, superstitious, reactionary, and obscene elements were either banned or rewritten, and the People's Theater and Jixiang Theater were helped to rehearse new plays such as "He Bo Marries a Wife" and "Farmers' Tears," and the "Poor Girl's Tears" and the seven-volume "Golden Whip Record" were transformed. After performing new plays, business gradually improved, with no less than a thousand spectators every day.
    Mass cultural and artistic activities were widely carried out during the Spring Festival, and a recreational competition was held. There were 17 men's and women's teams of various types, as well as 17 Yangko teams composed of teachers, students, and citizens from 37 units in various districts and streets. A total of 41 programs were performed, and 14 groups and individuals won awards. The forms and contents of the performances have also changed from the past, and various programs welcomed by the people have been performed. For example, the stilt walkers on 19th Street performed "Multiple Merits" and created more than ten scenes of "A Family's Tears" and a small quick-board about democratic construction. The land boat on 7th Street performed "Soong Mei-ling Escapes," and 27th Street created a magic lantern word exposing Chiang Kai-shek's peace conspiracy. On the third and fourth days of the Lunar New Year, citizens filled the public stadium, vying to watch.
    The social education and cultural activities in Baoding City still have shortcomings, mainly in that the connection with the current political tasks is not close enough, and artistic creation is not universal enough. In particular, it is very poor to strengthen contact with workers, guide them, and express them. This must be corrected in the future.

　　解放后的保定文化建设
    冀中分社
    保定市的社会教育与文艺工作，经三个月来的开展建设，已获得了初步成绩。在民众教育馆领导下，全市已建立黑板报九十七块（工厂学校未计在内），通过黑板报对目前形势和政策向市民进行了宣传解释，在进行群众性的归集敌伪的公家物资时，及时的把三区四十四街商民自动报出敌人藏的大枪模范事迹通报出去，迅速的传遍全市，启发了市民的缴纳公物的情绪。由于黑板报联系群众，因之拥有大量读者，据五区十五街的统计，该街两块黑板报，每天阅读者不下百余人，民教馆门前的三块大黑板报，经常有七、八人围看。民教馆为了及时供给黑板报材料，出版民众简报，每隔一天至二天发行一次，现已出版二十三期，其中内容，主要为时事政策与本市消息。民教馆所属之图书馆（新旧书九万五千余册）、博物展览室，蒋匪逃窜时曾被捣乱，经整理后已开馆两月余，增加新书五百余册，杂志五十一种，各种报纸八份，阅览人数由过去每日十余人增至四、五十人。由二月一日至十五日每日平均七、八十人。为了使学生、教师读书方便，该馆设立一巡回文库，学生与师生可通过市青联直接借书阅读。
    该馆为了贯彻政策，于二月十七日举行了工商业政策和房子问题的讲座。此外，并建立了两处扩音广播，与电影院放映前放映时事政策与本市新闻之玻璃板和增设群众问事箱等。
    为了满足工人、贫苦市民政治文化提高一步的要求，市教育局与各区街政府，结合市民生产，组织各种不同形式的学习小组，并有重点的建立了民校。一月二十五日的统计共建立民校八座，三百余人参加了学习，各种学习形式的学习小组共四十三个，四百六十八人。民校学习内容，以中心工作、时事、文化学习为主，学习小组以读报识字为主。学习情绪都很高，如五区十九街民校，第一天参加学习的五十四人，第二天便增到七十九人，有的并要求学习珠算。为了加强民校的管理，由区街干部、教师、学员中的积极分子，组织了民校管理委员会。
    对旧艺人的教育改造也收到相当成绩。他们在蒋匪统治下，受尽了压迫凌辱，为了维持生活，只得演出一些封建、迷信、淫荡的鼓词、落子等。为了改变其发展方向，使之成为人民的艺术，市教育局于去年十二月二十二日召开了旧艺人座谈会及女艺人座谈会，说明旧艺人在民主政权下之地位，指出今后应演出的节目，不少艺人控诉了蒋匪给予他们的痛苦。蔡保光自编刘化南残害人民的新鼓词，很受欢迎。对旧剧院则帮助其克服了管理上的毛病，纠正了前台对后台、经理与演员的克扣现象，使演员生活逐渐得到改善。旧剧本亦进行了审查改写工作，对散布封建、迷信、反动、淫乱因素者有的禁演，有的改写，并帮助人民剧院、吉祥剧院排演了“河伯娶媳”“农民泪”等新剧，改造了“贫女泪”与七大本“金鞭记”，从演出新剧后，营业逐渐好转，每日不下千余观众。
    在春节普遍开展了群众文艺活动，召开了游艺比赛大会，共有各种男女球队十七队，以及各区街教师、学生、市民三十七个单位组成的十七个秧歌队，共演出四十一个节目，十四个团体及个人得了奖。演出的形式内容也改变过去的一套，而出演了为人民大众所欢迎的各种节目。如十九街的高跷演出了“多功劳”并创作了十余场的“一家泪”和民主建政的小快板，七街的旱船演出“宋美龄逃跑”，二十七街创造了揭发蒋匪和平阴谋的洋片词，大年初三初四市民充塞了公共体育场，争相观览。
    保定市的社教与文艺活动，尚存在其缺点，主要表现在与当前政治任务联系还不够密切，文艺创作上还不普遍，尤其对工人，加强对他们的联系、引导他们、表现他们尤其差，这是今后必须注意改正的。
