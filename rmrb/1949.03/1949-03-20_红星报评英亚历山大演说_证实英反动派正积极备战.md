Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 18th. The commentator of the Soviet Red Star newspaper commented on the 12th on the British Minister of Defense Alexander's recent special speech on military issues in the House of Commons, saying: Alexander's speech once again confirms that powerful groups in Britain are continuing to take measures to prepare for a new war. Everyone knows that Britain is not threatened by any country, but the Ministry of Defense is demanding huge sums of money for a frantic arms race. Alexander's speech in the House of Commons also led people to another important conclusion, that is, Britain seems extremely alarmed by the growth of the national liberation movement in the colonies. Alexander called this movement "dangerous." In order to suppress this movement, he suggested organizing new detachments and strengthening the existing "local armies" to be responsible for maintaining "internal security" in the colonies. Alexander's speech was enthusiastically praised by the Conservative Party. The Conservative Party does indeed have every reason to "praise" the Labor government, because the Conservative Party's arms race plan and the new war plan against the democratic camp have found such enthusiastic executors. However, the Conservative Party's praise for the Labor leaders is the most acute rebuke for the British working people, because the Labor leaders are now pursuing a policy of participating in a new war.

　　红星报评英亚历山大演说
  　证实英反动派正积极备战
    【新华社陕北十八日电】苏联红星报评论员于十二日评论英国防部长亚历山大最近在下院发表关于军事问题的专篇演说称：亚历山大的演说，再度证实英国有势力的集团正在继续采取准备新战争的措施。大家知道，英国并未受到任何一个国家攻击的威胁，然而，国防部却要求巨量金钱进行疯狂的军备竞争。亚历山大在下院的演说还使人们得到另一个重要的结论，即英国对于殖民地的民族解放运动的增长似乎极为惊恐，亚历山大称这一运动是“危险”。为了镇压这一运动，他建议组织新的分遣队，加强现有的“地方军”，令他们负责维持殖民地的“内部治安”。亚历山大的发言受到保守党狂热的嘉奖。保守党的确有一切理由“赞美”工党政府，因为保守党军备竞赛的计划以及反对民主阵营的新战争计划，已经找到了这样热心的执行人。然而，保守党给予工党领袖的赞美，对于英国劳动人民说来，正是最尖锐的斥责，因为工党领袖现在正在奉行参加新战争的政策。
