Implementing a Crew Responsibility System
    Greatly Improves Administrative Efficiency

    Further News: The Pingjin Railway Administration is actively improving operational efficiency. The various locomotive depots under the Tianjin Branch have implemented a crew responsibility system, which has yielded good results, with locomotive daily mileage gradually increasing; the Tianjin East Station Locomotive Depot's locomotive daily vehicle mileage has reached 229.1 kilometers. The Guye Locomotive Depot has also reached 222.3 kilometers, exceeding the original preliminary target of 200 kilometers. In order to fully enhance operational efficiency, the Pingjin Railway Administration will call on locomotive depots on all lines to learn from Tianjin East Station and Guye Locomotive Depot. Due to the bureau's efforts to improve transportation management, loading and unloading speeds have increased, and scheduling has gradually become faster. The total daily volume of military and freight transportation on all lines under the bureau reached 33,924 tons on the 15th, a further increase in transportation volume compared to before. They are now striving to complete the transportation task of one million tons in March. (Chen Ji)

    Further News: In order to improve the quality of locomotives, the Pingjin Railway Administration has recently changed the maintenance standard from the past calculation based on locomotive operating time to calculation based on mileage traveled. This regulates maintenance according to the actual operating degree of the locomotive, which meets the needs of maintenance. The standards are set as follows: (1) Passenger locomotives: Overhaul - 360,000 kilometers. Medium repair - 120,000 kilometers. Class A inspection - 40,000 kilometers. Class B inspection - Inspection mileage is determined separately based on different water quality. (2) Freight locomotives: Overhaul - 315,000 kilometers. Medium repair - 105,000 kilometers. Class A inspection - 35,000 kilometers. Class B inspection - Inspection mileage is determined separately based on different water quality. The bureau also has new regulations for maintenance man-hours: Class A inspection: Usually, large locomotives with water tanks require 1,500 man-hours for inspection, with a maximum not exceeding 1,600 man-hours. Small locomotives are set at 1,300 man-hours, with a maximum not exceeding 1,400 man-hours. Class B inspection: Large locomotive repair is 150 man-hours. Small locomotives are 120 man-hours. Large Ma-Lie type locomotives are 200 man-hours. Class C inspection: Ordinary large locomotive repair is 110 man-hours. Small locomotives are 100 man-hours. Extra-large locomotives are 160 man-hours.

　　推行乘务负责制
    行政效率大提高
    又讯：平津铁路管理局积极提高行车效率。天津分局所辖各机务段推行乘务负责制，收到良好效果，机车日程公里逐步增高；天津东站机务段机车日车公里已达二百二十九点一公里。古冶机务段亦达二百二十二点三公里，超过原规定二百公里的初步努力目标。平津铁路管理局为了充分增强行车效率，将号召各线机务段向天津东站及古冶两机务段看齐。由于该局努力改善运输管理，装卸速度提高，调度亦渐迅速，该局所辖各线十五日一天军运货运总量曾达三万三千九百二十四吨，运输量较前再度增高，现正为完成三月份一百万吨的运输任务而奋斗。（陈迹）
    又讯：平津铁路管理局为提高机车质量，近将过去以机车运用时间为计算检修标准，改为以走行公里为检修标准。这是按机车真正运用程度而规定检修，合乎检修的需要。其标准定为：（一）旅客机车：大修——三十六万公里。中修——十二万公里。甲检——四万公里。乙检——根据水质不同分别定出检修里程。（二）货运机车：大修——三十一万五千公里。中修——十万零五千公里。甲检——三万五千公里。乙检——根据水质不同分别定出检修里程。该局对于检修工时，亦有新规定：甲检：通常带水柜大型机车检修一千五百工时，最大不能超过一千六百工时。小型机车定为一千三百工时，最大不能超过一千四百工时。乙检：大型机车修检为一百五十工时。小型机车为一百二十工时。大马列型机车为二百工时。丙检：普大型机车修检为一百一十工时。小型机车为一百工时。特大机车为一百六十工时。（陈迹）
