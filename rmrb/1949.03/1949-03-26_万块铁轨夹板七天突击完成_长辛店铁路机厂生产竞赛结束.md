　　10,000 Railroad Fishplates Completed in Seven-Day Blitz
    Changxindian Railway Machinery Plant Production Competition Concludes
    [This Newspaper's Dispatch] The Changxindian Railway Machinery Plant launched its first production competition after liberation on the 14th, successfully concluding on the 20th. The purpose of this competition was to fulfill the task assigned by the Pingjin Railway Bureau to the plant: to rush-produce 10,000 railroad fishplates within seven days to expedite the repair of the Jinpu Railway. To mobilize this competition, the plant convened a meeting of responsible persons and group leaders from all production units beforehand, specifically assigning tasks. Workers enthusiastically participated in this movement. The materials section and foundry were responsible for transporting materials, ensuring supply. The Li Changqing group put forward the slogan, "Don't look at our group being old and young, we can't do less work!" The nine members transported 848 times on the first day alone, equivalent to 424 scrap rails. Comrades Han Jin and Liu Fengqi continued working with their fingers bandaged after they were smashed. Thanks to everyone's active efforts, daily production exceeded the plan. For example, on the 17th, the Jianli field increased the standard of chopping and planing 300 meters of steel rail backs to 741 meters. The forging shop was the main force in this movement. Out of 195 employees, except for nine who were left to repair military equipment, the rest were all投入 to the blitz production. Based on the steam hammer equipment, they were divided into eight production groups. Besides two groups responsible for the cutting task, three groups were responsible for the night shift of making blanks, producing an average of about 1,500 pieces per day. Three groups were responsible for the day shift of punching holes, ensuring about 840 pieces, all exceeding the planned targets by more than 10%. In the intense production movement, the workers who did not directly participate in making the fishplates also automatically rose up and worked actively. The passenger and freight car field, with 243 employees, had 55 people participate in making fishplates, yet still maintained their daily work. Li Xi of the screw班, in addition to carefully taking care of his own windmill, also took time to help others pull iron into the furnace. Many indoor staff also helped the groups with recording and physical labor. Most worthy of promotion is that the workers, in the tense movement, promptly wrote moving poems based on their personal experiences, ensuring a constant stream of publications for the blackboard newspaper and staff newspaper, promoting the advancement of the movement. After everyone's concerted efforts, the task was successfully completed on the 20th. (Xing Jun)
    [Also from this Dispatch] In order to cooperate with the railway machinery plant in rushing to produce 10,000 railroad fishplates, the Changxindian Motorcycle Repair Shop voluntarily requested to undertake the task of cutting 1,000 pieces of material, scheduled to be completed in five and a half days. With few people (only ten forgers) and incomplete tools, they redoubled their efforts and completed it on the 17th, using only three and a half days.

　　万块铁轨夹板七天突击完成
    长辛店铁路机厂生产竞赛结束
    【本报讯】长辛店铁路机厂十四日展开解放后首次生产竞赛，于二十日下午胜利结束。这次竞赛的目的，是完成平津铁路局为抢修津浦路而给与该厂的七日内赶制一万块铁轨夹板的任务。该厂为发动此次竞赛，曾在事前召开全厂各生产单位负责人、小组长会议，具体做了分工，工人热烈参加这一运动，材料股、铸工场担负搬运材料，保证供给；李长庆组提出“别看俺组老和小，干起活来不能少”的口号，九个人头一天就搬运八百四十八次，合废钢轨四百二十四根。工友韩进、刘凤岐砸破了手指，用布包起继续工作。在大家积极努力下，每天均超过计划。如建立场十七日一天，即由预计剁刨钢轨背三百公尺的标准，增至七百四十一公尺。锻工场是这次运动中的主力，一百九十五个员工，除留九人修理军械外，其余全部投入突击生产。并根据汽锤的设备，分为八个生产小组。除两组负责截断任务外，三组负责夜班打坯子，平均每天出品一千五百块左右。三组负责日班打眼，每天可保证八百四十块上下，均超过预定计划的百分之十以上。在强烈的生产运动中，没有直接参加打夹板的工友，也都自动起来积极工作。客货车场二百四十三个员工，五十五人参加打夹板，仍可坚持日常工作。螺丝班的李喜，除细心照顾自己的风车外，还抽空帮助别人拉铁装炉。不少室内职员，也帮助小组作纪录和参加体力劳动。最值得发扬的是工人在紧张的运动中，及时将自己的亲身体验，写出动人的诗歌，保证黑板报和职工小报源源出版，推动着运动的前进。经过大家齐心努力二十日胜利完成任务。（邢军）
    【又讯】长辛店摩托修理厂为配合铁路机厂赶制万块铁道夹板，曾自动要求负担截断一千块料子的任务，预定五天半完成。他们在人力少（只有十个锻工），工具又不全的情况下，百倍努力，竟于十七日就完成了。只用了三天半时间。
