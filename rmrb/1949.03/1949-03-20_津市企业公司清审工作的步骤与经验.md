Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, March 18th: After completing the inventory work, the Tianjin Enterprise Company and its affiliated factories, including the Machinery Factory, Nail Making Factory, Ice Making Factory, Chemical Factory, Textile Factory, Soy Sauce Factory, and Ink Factory, began a clean-up and audit on the 4th of last month, which lasted for three weeks and has now come to an end. The factories have investigated more than 500 kinds of materials, such as secret machine parts and products, that were either omitted from the accounts or embezzled. For example, the Textile Factory found that the materials omitted from registration included 125 batches of cotton gin saw blades, 106 steel wire needles, 51 large and small gears for combing, 521 yards of white shoe cloth, 21,071 feet of raising fillet, and 8,515 feet of opening fillet. Embezzled materials included 1,346 pounds of "17-count yarn" and 4,500 catties of cloth strips. The Machinery Factory found that the materials omitted from registration included valuable eight-horsepower internal combustion engines, small grinders, etc.

The clean-up and audit work is a re-examination after the takeover and inventory are completed to clarify any omitted accounts, unclear figures, and other suspicious matters. This is a very meticulous task. The steps taken by the Tianjin Enterprise Company in carrying out this work are as follows: Before the clean-up and audit, all factories carried out ideological and organizational preparations. Clean-up and audit committees were formed within the company and each factory, with the participation of military representatives, assistants from the military control commission, and work team comrades, as well as workers (with emphasis on absorbing workers). The workers absorbed into the clean-up and audit committee should be loyal, honest, active, and familiar with the factory's situation. The First Textile Factory took the following steps in organizing the clean-up and audit committee: 1. First, convene a temporary workers' representative meeting to explain the significance of the clean-up and audit and the attitude that workers should have in the clean-up and audit. Explain that workers will be absorbed to participate in this clean-up and audit, propose the conditions for participants, and ask them to bring it to the workers' masses for deliberation. 2. Convene temporary workers' representatives to report the opinions of the masses and solicit the opinions of the representatives. 3. Based on the reports and other investigations, convene a workers' congress to explain the significance and purpose of the clean-up and audit, eliminate certain incorrect ideas existing among the workers, and further stimulate their sense of ownership. 4. Convene a staff meeting, clearly pointing out that many materials were found during the inventory, some were not on the books, and some did not match the inventory in quantity or quality. Tell them that this handover was rushed, and omissions or errors were inevitable. Ask everyone to think carefully and report them quickly. If they do not report now, it will be bad if they are found out later. 5. After careful deliberation, convene a general meeting of employees to elect the clean-up and audit committee. At the same time, key investigations and research were carried out. The clean-up and audit work of each factory is generally carried out from three aspects: (1) Reviewing the accounts to see whether the "previous stock," "purchases," "sales," and "current stock" (i.e., what is reported on the current inventory) are consistent. When checking accounts, pay attention to the ledgers of dealings between factories and the company, between factories, and between the company, factories, and outside firms. (2) Investigating and researching among the employees – this is the main link in the clean-up work. (3) Understanding the existing production process by comparing the current output of finished products, raw material consumption, and capital utilization with the past. The above three aspects should be closely coordinated and used flexibly. There are approximately two ways of coordinating: One is to first find clues from the masses, then compare them with the inventory, and then return to the masses for further understanding; the other is to first understand from the accounts, find suspicious points, then collect materials from the masses, and then further understand from the accounts. For example, after the establishment of the Clean-up and Audit Committee of the First Textile Factory, it reviewed the accounts and learned about the situation at the same time. Starting from the finished product warehouse, it was immediately discovered in the accounts that 133 bundles (10 pounds per bundle) of "17-count yarn" were short. At the same time, a dug-out gap was found on the wall of the back room. According to the factory director, the "17-count yarn" was stolen by the Kuomintang army from this gap before liberation. However, the inspection of the gap did not look like it was dug in from the outside. The Clean-up and Audit Committee investigated among the workers and found that the gap was originally dug by the factory director before the liberation. The Clean-up and Audit Committee conducted further in-depth investigations among the masses and successively discovered many important clues. Then, they talked to the staff individually to confirm that the "17-count yarn" had actually been embezzled, and then talked with the factory director to resolve the issue. (2) The preliminary experience of this clean-up and audit work by the Enterprise Company and its seven affiliated factories is: First, the main key to the entire clean-up and audit work lies in mobilizing the masses of employees. Often, less is learned about a problem from files and accounts, and more is learned from the masses. If the employee work at this stage is not done well and the masses cannot be mobilized, the clean-up and audit work will not be done well. For example, the First Soy Sauce Factory elected temporary employee representatives, but because there was not enough preparation beforehand and the workers were not sufficiently aware, two of the three representatives elected were heads of the Kuomintang district branch, and one was a puppet trade union cadre. They secretly threatened those participating in the clean-up and audit work, telling them not to reveal the truth to the takeover personnel, which greatly hindered the clean-up and audit work. After the takeover personnel discovered this, they strengthened worker education on the one hand, and exposed the specific facts of the puppet trade union's past oppression of workers at the conference, and then had the workers discuss the qualifications that representatives should have. After repeated deliberations, the representatives were solemnly re-elected. After the representatives were re-elected, the clean-up and audit work went smoothly. Second, promptly dispel the concerns of the masses. Due to the Kuomintang's long-term deceptive propaganda, most employees were initially somewhat apprehensive about us and dared not boldly offer opinions to us. Some even held a skeptical attitude, while others had thoughts of being afraid of offending people. In addition to strengthening propaganda and education for these thoughts of employees, we must also check at any time whether there are deviations in our implementation of policies and whether there are any inappropriate aspects in our work style. Third, the clean-up and audit should have a focus. In terms of time, pay attention to whether there were "taking advantage of the chaos" phenomena during the chaotic period before liberation. In terms of assets and equipment, generally first review various valuable and easily movable machines, raw materials, and finished products, such as yarn in textile factories, high-speed steel in machinery factories, and valuable machines in the laboratories of chemical factories. The difference between the number of items inventoried and the number reported on the inventory should be investigated first. Fourth, pay attention to coordination between higher and lower levels, contact between factories, and coordination between the company and the factories. For example, in the Textile Factory, it was found that temporary wages for December were paid with red shirts and white shoe cloth, supposedly because the company could not pay wages at the time; however, it was learned from the company that wages had been subsequently paid. From this, it was found that Textile Factory employees had embezzled. Secondly, those who check accounts and files in the company's factories should also closely cooperate with those who understand the situation from the masses. Furthermore, the factories should also maintain contact. For example, the Soy Sauce Factory did not find anything at the beginning of the clean-up and audit. Later, it was learned from the employees of the Textile Factory that the factory had privately distributed soy sauce, so the clean-up and audit found a focus. Fifth, make more comparisons, especially compare housing and land and their interrelationships with the past. Sixth, do not neglect to understand the situation from the staff. Workers' understanding of the problem often only gives an impression and can only provide clues. Detailed and specific information must be understood from the staff (mainly middle and lower-level staff). The best way to understand is to have individual conversations. Seventh, during the clean-up and audit, do not wait until a lot of data has been collected before studying it. Investigate and research at any time. After the research, conduct further investigations. The investigation and research should first focus on one point to break through and go deep, and connect from one thing to many things.

　　津市企业公司清审工作的步骤与经验
    【新华社天津十八日电】津市企业公司及其所属机器、制钉、制冰、化学、纺织、酱油、油墨等七厂于完成清点工作后，上月四日开始又进行清理审查工作，历时三星期，现已告一段落。各厂共审查出被漏帐或贪污的各秘密机器零件、产品等物资达五百余种。如纺织厂查出遗漏登记的物资有制棉锯条一百二十五批，钢丝针梭一百零六根，梳毛用大小牙轮五十一个，白鞋料布五百二十一码，起毛针布二万一千零七十一英尺，开口针布八千五百一十五英尺及被贪污的物资有“十七支纱”一千三百四十六磅及布条四千五百斤等。机器厂查出遗漏登记的物资中有贵重的八匹马力内燃机、小磨床等。
    清理审查工作，就是在接管清点完毕以后，重新进行一次审查，将遗漏的帐目，不清楚的数字和其他可疑事项审查清楚，这是一件极细致的工作。津市企业公司进行这一步工作的步骤是：在清审前，各厂都进行了思想上和组织上的准备工作，在公司及各厂内，分组清审委员会，除军管会的军事代表、助理员与工作组同志参加外，并吸收职工（着重吸收工人）参加，被吸收参加清审委员会的职工要忠诚老实，工作积极，熟悉厂内情况者。第一纺织厂在组织清审委员会时采取了以下的步骤：一、首先召开工人临时代表会，说明清审意义及职工在清审中应有的态度，并讲明这次清审要吸收工人参加，提出参加者的条件，由他们带到工人群众中酝酿。二、召集工人临时代表汇报群众的意见，并征求代表们的意见。三、根据汇报及其他方面的调查，召开工人大会，说明清审工作的意义和目的，消除工人中存在着的某些不正确的观念，进一步启发其主人翁思想。四、召开职工大会，明确指出：清点中发现许多物资，有的不在帐，有的在数量或质量上与清册不符，告诉他们这次交代仓促，不免有遗漏或错误的地方，大家回去仔细想想赶快补报上来，现在不报，以后查出就不好。五、酝酿成熟后，召开全体职工大会，选举清审委员会。与此同时，并进行了有重点的调查研究工作。各厂清审工作一般是从三方面进行：（一）从帐目上审查“前存”、“购入”、“卖出”与“现在结存”即现在清册上造报的是否相符。查帐时注意工厂与公司间、工厂与工厂间、公司、工厂与外面行号间的来往帐簿。（二）从职工群众中调查研究——这是清查工作中的主要环节。（三）从现有生产过程中进行了解，拿现在的成品产量、原料消费、资金运用等与过去比较。以上三方面要密切配合，灵活运用。配合的方式约有下面二种：一种是先从群众中找寻线索，再对照清册，然后回到群众中作进一步了解；另一种是先从帐册上了解，找出可疑之点，再到群众中收集材料，然后进一步从帐册上了解。如第一纺织厂清审委员会成立以后即一面审阅帐目，一面了解情况。首先从成品库查起，当时即在帐目上发现“十七支纱”短一百三十三捆（每捆十磅），同时在后房墙上发现一挖开的缺口。据厂长说，该项“十七支纱”是解放前被国民党军队从这个缺口偷去的。但是检查缺口，不象是从外面挖进来的。清审会到工人中调查，结果发现缺口原来是厂长在解放前二日派人挖的。清审委员会再到群众中去进行深入调查，又陆续发现许多重要线索，然后找职员个别谈话证实此项“十七支纱”实系被贪污后，再与厂长谈话解决。（二）此次企业公司及其所属七个厂的清审工作，其初步经验是：第一、整个清审工作的主要关键在于发动职工群众，往往一个问题从卷宗帐册上了解到的较少，而从群众中了解到的较多，如果这一阶段的职工工作没有做好，群众发动不起来，清审工作就做不好。如第一酱油厂选举临时职工代表，因事前没有充分准备，工人觉悟不够，选出的三个代表中，有两个是国民党区分部负责人，一个是伪工会干事，他们暗中威胁参加清审工作的人，叫不要给接管人员透露真情，因而使清审工作受很大阻碍。接管人员发现以后，便一面加强工人教育，一面在大会上揭露伪工会过去压迫工人的具体事实，再由工人讨论代表应具备的条件。如此经过反复酝酿后才郑重改选代表。代表改选以后，清审工作也就顺利了。第二、及时解除群众顾虑。由于国民党长期的欺骗宣传，一般职工最初对我们多少有些顾虑，不敢大胆向我们提意见，有的甚至还抱着怀疑观望态度，有的则存在着怕得罪人等思想。对于职工们的这些思想，除加强宣传教育外，还要随时检查自己执行政策时有无偏向，在作风上有无不妥当的地方。第三、清审要有重点，在时间上，要注意解放前的一段混乱时期是否有“趁火打劫”的现象。在资产设备上，一般先审查各种贵重而易移动的机器，原料和成品，如纺织厂的纱线，机器厂的锋钢，化学厂试验室的贵重机器等。清点数与清册上造报数差额大的要先追究。第四、要注意上下配合，各厂联系，公司与各厂的配合等，譬如在纺织厂发现十二月份临时工资发红衬衫与白鞋料布，据说因当时公司发不出工资；但从公司方面了解，知道后来已补发了工资，由此查出纺织厂职员有贪污情事。其次，公司各厂内查帐册卷宗的与向群众了解情况的也要密切配合，再则各厂间也要保持联系。如酱油厂在开始清审时什么也没查出来，后来从纺织厂职工中知道，该厂曾私分酱油，因此清审便找到了重点。第五、多作比较，特别是审查房地及其间相互关系要与过去比较。第六、不要忽视从职员中了解情况，工人了解问题往往只有一个印象，只能供给线索，详细具体情况还要从职员中了解（主要是中下级职员），了解方式最好采取个别谈话。第七、清审时，不要等收集到许多资料后再研究，要随时调查随时研究，研究以后，再作进一步调查，调查研究要先抓住一点突破深入，由一件事情联系到许多事情。
