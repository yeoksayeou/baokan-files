　　North China People's Government Instructs Jinzhong:
    Pingyao and Yuci Establish Chengguan Districts
  　People's Representative Conferences May Be Established
    [Pingshi News] The North China People's Government issued instructions to the Jinzhong Administrative Office on the 10th, abolishing the cities of Pingyao, Yuci, Fenyang, etc., and establishing Chengguan Districts instead. The instructions stated: At present, there are two types of city establishments in the North China region: one is municipalities directly under the North China region, such as Ping, Tianjin, and Shijiazhuang; the other is municipalities directly under the province or administrative region, such as Baoding and Zhangjiakou; special district-level cities and county-affiliated cities should all be abolished and replaced with Chengguan Districts or towns. Your district's Pingyao, Yuci, Fenyang, etc., should also be replaced with Chengguan Districts. Chengguan Districts are different from ordinary county-administered districts. Chengguan Districts are mainly industrial and commercial in terms of economy, while county-administered districts are agricultural. Chengguan Districts are political power units with people's representative conferences and district governments, while ordinary county-administered districts are only established for the convenience of county government leadership. District offices are auxiliary organs of the county government's administration and are not a level of political power, so they do not have people's representative conferences. After Pingyao, Yuci, Fenyang, etc., in your district are changed to Chengguan Districts, they will still be political power units. At present, representative conferences from all walks of life can be convened, and after the work has a certain foundation, people's representative conferences will be established. As for the organizational structure of the Chengguan District government, it should also be different from that of ordinary district offices depending on the specific circumstances. If necessary, sections or units may be established according to the nature of the work. The number of personnel should be determined based on the size of the population in the jurisdiction and the size of the economic tasks (referring to industry and commerce), which may be the same as or appropriately increased from that of ordinary district offices (the number of personnel in general Chengguan Districts or towns can be the same as that of district offices), but it is essential to avoid a large organization and superfluous personnel, so that the effort expended is not commensurate with the role played.

　　华北人民政府指示晋中
    平遥榆次设城关区
  　可成立人民代表会议
    【平市讯】华北人民政府十日向晋中行政公署发出指令，撤销平遥、榆次、汾阳等市，改设城关区。指令略称：目前华北区市的建制分两种：一为华北区级直辖市如平、津、石家庄等市；一为省或行政区直辖市如保定、张家口等市；专属市与县属市一律撤销，改设城关区或镇。你区平遥、榆次、汾阳等市，亦应改设城关区。城关区与一般县辖之区不同，城关区在经济上主要为工商业，而县辖之区为农业。城关区为一政权单位设人民代表会议与区政府，而一般县辖之区仅为县政府领导便利而设，区公所为县政府行政之辅助机关，并非一级政权，不设人民代表会议。你区平遥、榆次、汾阳等市改设城关区后，仍各为政权单位，目前可召开各界代表会，俟工作有一定基础后，即成立人民代表会议。至于城关区政府之组织编制，亦视具体情况与一般区公所有所区别，必要时得按工作性质设科、或股。编制人数视辖区人口之多少，经济任务（指工商业）之大小，可与一般区公所相同或适当增加（一般城关区或镇，其编制人数可与区公所同），但切忌编制庞大，浮设人员，致所花费之力量与所起作用不相称。
