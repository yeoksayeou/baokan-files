　　Xuzhou Former Police Officers

  　After Education, Thinking Begins to Change

    [Xinhua News Agency, East China, 14th Dispatch] Former police officers employed by the Xuzhou Public Security Bureau have begun to change their old ideology and work style after education and transformation. Many former police officers have shown good results in solving robbery cases, uncovering bandits in hiding, and maintaining public order. For example, Chen Jizhe, a former police officer, has been working actively after reflecting on his past. After learning that enemy weapons were hidden in a well, he disregarded the cold and personally went down the well to retrieve four guns and 140 bullets, and assisted in solving two robbery cases. Other former police officers have also been able to fulfill their duties in checking household registrations and taking care of lost children. During the Lunar New Year, police officers who were invited to dinner by merchants were generally able to politely decline. As a result, citizens' perceptions of police officers have also begun to change. There is such discussion among citizens: "The current police dare not eat privately or be corrupt, and they give people money when they buy things! They have learned well under the education of the People's Government."

    [Another Dispatch] The East China Police Academy has opened in Jinan City last month to train a large number of people's police cadres. The school is divided into officer and police departments. The first batch of students has more than 1,100 people, most of whom are high school, junior high school, and elementary school students from various places, and a small number of former police officers.

　　徐州旧警察人员
  　经过教育思想开始转变
    【新华社华东十四日电】徐州市公安局录用的旧警察人员，经过教育改造后，旧的思想作风已开始转变。不少旧警察人员，在破获抢案与藏匪，维持治安方面，表现出很好的成绩。如旧警察人员陈继哲经过反省后，工作积极。他获悉在井里藏有敌人武器后，便不顾寒冷，亲自下井捞出枪四支，子弹一百四十发，并协助破获抢案两起。其余旧警察人员在清查户口照顾迷路小孩等方面，也能尽忠职责。在过旧历年时，被商人请吃饭的警察人员，一般均能婉言谢绝。因此，市民对于警察人员的观感也开始改变。市民中间发生这样的议论：“现在的警察，不敢吃私、贪污了，买东西也给人家钱啦！他们在人民政府教育下学好了。”
    【又讯】华东警官学校为培养大批人民警察干部，已于上月在济南市开学。该校共分警官、警士两部，第一期学员有一千一百余，大部份为来自各地之高、初、中学生，小部份为旧警察。
