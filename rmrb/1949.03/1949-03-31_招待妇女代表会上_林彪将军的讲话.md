　　Reception for Women Representatives
    General Lin Biao's Speech
    [This newspaper's dispatch] The Headquarters of the Chinese People's Liberation Army's Pingjin Front hosted a banquet at the Beijing Hotel at 7 p.m. the night before last (the 29th) to welcome all the representatives of the First National Women's Congress of China. General Lin Biao delivered a speech. He first explained that Chinese women have made significant contributions to the anti-imperialist and anti-feudal revolutionary struggles over the years, and have especially enthusiastically supported the People's Liberation War, giving the soldiers great help and encouragement. Therefore, the liberation of the Chinese people and the construction of a new China must have the participation of women in order to succeed. Regarding the issue of the liberation of Chinese women, General Lin Biao pointed out that Chinese women have suffered the deepest oppression and have the strongest revolutionary spirit. Those who oppress Chinese women are the feudal forces, imperialism, and bureaucratic capitalism that oppress the Chinese people. Therefore, the liberation of Chinese women must thoroughly overthrow the feudal forces, imperialist forces, bureaucratic capitalist forces, and the Kuomintang reactionary government that represents all these evil forces. The further liberation of Chinese women in the future must advance with the liberation of the entire society. Now we must build a new democratic society, and in the future, we must prepare to enter a socialist and communist society, so that women can be thoroughly liberated. Then he talked about the fact that the Chinese people's revolution against imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism is about to succeed, but the Kuomintang reactionaries, under the instigation of American imperialism, still want to play with false peace and seek a chance to breathe. We must not be deceived by him! We must carry the revolution through to the end! If the enemy is willing to surrender, we will accept it; otherwise, we will completely, thoroughly, and entirely eliminate them in the Tianjin way. Finally, he emphasized: The national victory is coming soon, and Chinese women must more closely participate in the construction of the new China!

　　招待妇女代表会上
    林彪将军的讲话
    【本报讯】中国人民解放军平津前线司令部前晚（二十九日）七时在北京饭店设宴招待中国妇女第一次全国代表大会全体代表时，林彪将军致词。他首先说明中国妇女历年来在反帝反封建的革命斗争中，有重大的贡献，特别热烈支援了人民解放战争，给战士们很大的帮助和鼓励；所以，中国人民解放和新中国的建设，必须有妇女参加才能成功。关于中国妇女解放的问题，林彪将军指出中国妇女所受压迫最为深重，革命性甚为强烈，压迫中国妇女的，也就是压迫中国人民的封建势力，帝国主义和官僚资本主义，所以中国妇女的解放，必须彻底推翻封建势力，帝国主义势力，官僚资本势力和代表这一切恶势力的国民党反动政府。中国妇女将来更进一步的解放，须随着整个社会的解放而向前推进，在现在要建设新民主主义社会，在将来要准备走进社会主义、共产主义的社会，妇女才能澈底的得到解放。接着他谈到目前中国人民对反帝、反封建、反官僚资本主义的革命快要成功了，但是国民党反动派在美帝国主义策动下，还想玩弄虚伪和平，争取喘息机会。我们决不可受他的欺骗！我们一定要把革命进行到底！如果敌人愿意投降，我们接受，否则，就以天津方式彻底干脆全部消灭之。最后，他强调指出：全国胜利即将到来，中国妇女要更加紧参加新中国建设工作！
