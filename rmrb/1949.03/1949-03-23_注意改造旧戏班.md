Pay Attention to Transforming Old Opera Troupes

Editor:
    I have seen that many villages are staging old operas for entertainment. The content of these operas is all old feudal and superstitious things. For example, in the second and third districts of Jingxing County and in Luoyang, Baihua, and other villages, the content of the operas being performed is either about ghosts or gods, or about men and women flirting. Such operas not only fail to educate and inspire the masses but also sow poison among them. For example, saying that "human life is determined by fate" is simply speaking for the feudal rulers.
    At present, the people in the liberated areas have universally improved their political consciousness and do not like these old operas that spread feudal superstition. However, because there are not many new dramas with vitality in some places, some old operas have to be performed. In the future, I hope that all regions, especially the newly liberated areas, will strengthen the inspection and leadership of old opera troupes, transform them, and prohibit the performance of old operas that praise feudal superstition among the masses. I also suggest that all writers engaged in creating songs and dramas create more scripts, clapper talks, and songs that are popular with the rural or urban masses.

### 注意改造旧戏班

　　注意改造旧戏班编辑同志：
    我看到有好多村子，为了娱乐而唱旧戏。唱的内容都是从前封建迷信的东西，如井陉县二、三区及洛杨、白化等村，唱的戏的内容，不是鬼就是神。或者是男人女人吊膀子。象这样的戏，不但不能教育鼓舞群众，反而在群众中种下毒素，如说“人命由天定”，这简直是替封建统治者说话。
    目前解放区的人民，政治觉悟普遍提高，并不喜爱这种散布封建迷信的旧戏，但由于目前有些地方富有生命力的新剧，还不多，有些旧戏又不得不唱。今后，我希望各地，特别是新解放区对旧戏班应多加检查领导，进行改造，禁止在群众中演唱歌颂封建迷信的旧戏。并建议所有从事创作歌曲、戏剧的作家，多多创作些农村或城市群众爱好的剧本、快板及歌曲。
