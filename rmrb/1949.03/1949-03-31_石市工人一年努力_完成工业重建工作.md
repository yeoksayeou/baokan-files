Shijiazhuang Workers' One Year of Effort
　　Completes Industrial Reconstruction

[Report from this newspaper] The Shijiazhuang First Staff and Workers' Congress, which grandly opened on the 15th of this month, in its report on the staff and workers' movement in Shijiazhuang since liberation, stated the glorious achievements made by the working class of Shijiazhuang in restoring and reconstructing the people's industry: When Shijiazhuang was first liberated in November 1947, all the city's industries and construction had been devastated by the Chiang bandits, such as the city's largest Daxing Yarn Factory, which was continuously bombed by enemy planes, leaving almost no intact warehouses and factory buildings, and the machines were either destroyed or damaged; the water supply, automatic telephones, and electric lights were also largely destroyed. However, the victory of the people encouraged all the staff and workers of Shijiazhuang, who bravely protected their factories and machines during the liberation and rapidly resumed production after the liberation. Railway workers escorted 45 locomotives to safety under enemy bombing; electric light workers completed two months of resumption plan in one month and five days, illuminating the whole city; the Daxing Yarn Factory rebuilt the factory from the ruins in just two months. Last winter, after the military and civilians of North China repelled the Chiang bandits who raided Shijiazhuang, the city's state-owned factory workers launched a production increase and loss compensation campaign to make up for the losses caused by the work stoppage for war preparedness, which further highlighted the enthusiasm and creativity of the Shijiazhuang working class in building the people's industry. Workers at the Third Power Plant improved coal-burning methods, saving more than 1 million catties of coal every day. The railway machinery factory had more than 100 valuable inventions in a month and a half of competition; electric light workers made their own transformers in the case of extremely scarce raw materials; the staff and workers of Daxing Yarn Factory found substitutes for the British-dominated "leather shaft ne". Before February, the staff and workers of all state-owned factories in the city had completed their factory's production increase and loss compensation production plans one after another, and most factories had exceeded the plans: for example, the railway machinery factory not only made up for the losses caused by the work stoppage for war preparedness, but also increased the state's income by 400,000 catties of rice, and the production level of locomotives and passenger and freight cars has exceeded that of the enemy puppets and the Kuomintang era. The Daxing Yarn Factory, which started work on January 18 last year with only 400 spindles, has, through the active efforts of its staff and workers over the past year, reassembled the dilapidated machines, and now has more than 11,000 spindles in operation, and the output of fine yarn has exceeded that before the war. Now, Shijiazhuang's people's industry, relying on the city's working class, has victoriously completed the restoration and reconstruction work.

　　石市工人一年努力
    完成工业重建工作
    【本报讯】于本月十五日隆重开幕的石家庄首届职工大会，在关于解放以来石市的职工运动的报告中，陈述了石市工人阶级在恢复与重建人民的工业上作出了光荣的业迹：一九四七年十一月石家庄刚解放时，全市所有的工业和建设，已被蒋匪毁坏得破烂不堪，如本市最大的大兴纱厂经敌机连续轰炸，几乎没留下一间完好的仓库和厂房，机器都已炸毁或震坏；自来水，自动电话，电灯亦大部被毁。但人民的胜利，鼓舞着石家庄的全体职工，他们在解放时英勇保护自己的工厂和机器，解放后迅速恢复生产。铁路工人在敌机轰炸下，将四十五台机车护送到安全地带；电灯工人一个月零五天完成了两个月的复工计划使全市大放光明；大兴纱厂仅仅两个月内把工厂从废墟上重建起来。去年冬天华北军民击退偷袭石市的蒋匪以后，全市公营工厂职工为弥补备战停工的损失而展开的增产补损竞赛运动，更高度发挥了石市工人阶级在建设人民的工业中的积极性与创造性，第三发电厂工人改善烧煤办法，每日节省煤一百余万斤。铁路机厂在一个半月的竞赛中，有价值的创造发明达百件以上；电灯工人在原料异常缺乏的情况下，自制了变压器；大兴纱厂职工找到了代替英国专制的“皮轴呢”代用品。全市各公营工厂的职工，在二月以前，都先后完成了自己工厂的增产补损生产计划，大多数工厂并超过了计划：如铁路机厂不仅弥补了备战停工的损失，还增加了国家收入四十万斤米，机车和客货车的生产水平已经超过了敌伪与国民党统治时代。去年一月十八日开工时仅有四百枚纱锭的大兴纱厂，经过一年来职工们的积极努力，把残破的机器重新装配起来，现在已开动一万一千余枚纱锭，细纱的产量已超过战前。现在石家庄的人民工业，依靠着全市工人阶级已经胜利的完成了恢复和重建工作。
