Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 27th. TASS, Berlin, 22nd: The Press Office of the Soviet Military Administration in Germany issued the Deputy Director of the Military Administration's Finance Department's response to questions from reporters regarding the currency circulation situation in the Soviet Zone of Germany: Since the implementation of currency reform in June 1948, the total amount of new currency issued in the entire zone was 4.112 billion Deutsche Marks. Since then, no new currency has been issued, and the total amount of currency in circulation has remained at 4.112 billion Marks. According to statistics on February 1st, credit institutions held 814 million, and residents, enterprises, and organizations held 3.298 billion. The Soviet representative pointed out that due to the implementation of various economic measures, the purchasing power of the New Mark (Deutsche Mark) has greatly increased in the past six months. The sound currency circulation situation in the Soviet Zone is also closely related to financial measures that prevent budget deficits. Not only that, but after six months, budget revenues exceeded expenditures by 221 million Marks. The currency system in the Soviet Zone is very stable and is becoming more consolidated month by month. In this situation, the absurdity of the news published in many newspapers in the western occupied areas of Berlin about the non-existent plan of the Soviet Zone to implement currency reform again is very obvious.

　　德境苏占区货币稳定
  　新马克购买力已提高
    【新华社陕北二十七日电】据塔斯社柏林廿二日讯：德境苏联军政府新闻处发表军政府财政处副处长对新闻记者所提关于德境苏占区货币流通情形问题的答复：自一九四八年六月实施货币改革以来，全区发出的新币数量为四十一亿一千二百万德国马克。以后，就再没有增发过新币，流通中的货币总额始终保持着四十一亿一千二百万马克的数量。根据二月一日的统计，信用机关存有八亿一千四百万，居民、企业及团体持有三十二亿九千八百万。苏联代表指出：由于实施了各种经济措施，新马克（德国马克）的购买力在半年来已大大提高。苏占区货币流通情况之良好，与防止预算亏绌的财政措施，亦有密切关系。不仅如此，半年的结果，预算中的收入，还超出开支二亿二千一百万马克。苏占区货币制度十分稳定，并且逐月益趋巩固。在这种情形之下，柏林西部占领区不少报纸所发表的关于莫须有的苏占区打算再次实行货币改革的消息，其荒谬就十分明显。
