　　Telegram of Congratulations from the North China People's Government, the North China Bureau of the CPC Central Committee, and the North China Military Region
    [By Our Correspondent] The North China People's Government, the North China Bureau of the CPC Central Committee, and the North China Military Region of the Chinese People's Liberation Army have sent a telegram of congratulations to the First National Congress of Chinese Women. The original telegram is as follows:

    Comrades of the National Women's Congress: The entire military and civilian population of North China warmly congratulate the opening of your congress. In the Anti-Japanese War and the People's Liberation War, the women of the liberated areas worked hard to support the front lines, participate in production and land reform, and played an extremely great role. The women in the Kuomintang-controlled areas, disregarding the reactionary派's [I have kept this as 派 because there is no single word to translate this] frantic suppression and persecution, heroically persisted in the struggle and gave powerful support to the victorious advance of the People's Liberation Army. Now that the People's Liberation cause is about to triumph throughout the country, we believe that you will call on the broad masses of women to strengthen unity, work hard, and strive to completely eliminate the rule of the Kuomintang reactionaries, drive out the aggressive forces of American imperialism, and defend world peace.
