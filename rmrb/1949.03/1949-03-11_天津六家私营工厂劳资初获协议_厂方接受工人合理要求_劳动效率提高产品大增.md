Tianjin Electric News: After the factory owners of six private factories, including the New Tianjin Rubber Factory in Tianjin, accepted the reasonable demands of the workers to improve working conditions, production efficiency has significantly improved. Workers at Hengxingtai Iron Factory used to work up to 11 and a half hours a day, eating only two meals of sorghum noodles. The highest wage was only 60 jin of corn flour per month, making it impossible to maintain a family life. Moreover, the factory often delayed paying wages, and the wages for October of last year had not been received by the end of the year. Working hours at Baofeng Flour Machine Manufacturing Factory also reached 11 hours. At the New Tianjin Rubber Factory, each worker's daily wage was only between two and a half to five jin of corn flour. Under these circumstances, workers faced hardship and had very low morale. After liberation, the workers understood the "Labor-Management Both Benefit" policy, and they spontaneously organized to demand improved working conditions from the factory owners. Workers from New Tianjin, Baofeng, and Huazhong Printing Factory elected representatives to request the factory owners to adjust wages, while also expressing that they would continue to obey the factory owners' management in production to eliminate the factory owners' concerns. Workers at Hengxingtai Iron Factory requested the factory owners to quickly pay the overdue wages, improve living standards, and appropriately reduce working hours to take care of the workers' health. After mediation by the work teams in each district based on the principle of benefiting both labor and management, the factory owners accepted the workers' reasonable demands, changing the working hours from 11 hours to 10 hours and making reasonable adjustments to wages. For example, wages at Huazhong Printing Factory have increased from five to thirteen jin of corn flour per person per day in the past to seven to sixteen jin. The New Tianjin Rubber Factory even formed a wage assessment committee jointly by workers and the factory, making appropriate assessments of each worker's wage based on technical skill, labor strength, and the weight of responsibility. After the workers' living conditions were guaranteed to a certain extent, production morale improved, and production efficiency also increased daily. In the past, the New Tianjin Rubber Factory produced 40 defective tires for every 100 tires produced, while now there are only four or five. Hengxingtai Iron Factory's output (nails, wire) was less than 70 jin per day in the past, but now it reaches 120 jin. In the past, 80 workers at Baofeng Flour Machine Factory could only manufacture three or four flour machines a month, but now 26 people can manufacture one or two. The daily printing volume of the offset press at Huazhong Printing Factory has increased from 9,000 sheets to 10,000 sheets. Workers at the New Tianjin Rubber Factory said with satisfaction: "This is almost right. In the past, only labor or management benefited (referring to the capitalist), but this time it is truly benefiting both labor and management." The factory owner of Baofeng Factory also said with satisfaction: "This is even more cost-effective than before. Ten hours a day produces more than eleven hours in the past."

　　天津六家私营工厂劳资初获协议
    厂方接受工人合理要求
    劳动效率提高产品大增
    【天津电】天津市新天津橡胶工厂等六个私营工厂的厂主，接受工人所提出的改善劳动条件的合理要求后，生产效率业已显著提高。亨兴泰铁工厂的工人过去每天工作达十一小时半，仅吃两顿高粱面，工资最高的，每人每月仅玉米面六十斤，家庭生活根本无法维持。而厂方发放工资又经常拖延，去年十月份的工资到年底还未领到。保丰面粉机器制造厂工作时间亦达十一小时。新天津橡胶工厂每人每天工资只有二斤半到五斤玉米面。在这种情形下，工人生活困难，生产情绪极低。解放后，工人们明白了“劳资两利”的政策后，便自动的组织起来向厂方要求改善劳动条件。新天津、保丰及华中印刷厂等工人均推选代表要求厂方调整工资，同时表示在今后生产上，仍服从厂主的管理以消除厂主的顾虑。亨兴泰铁工厂工人向厂方提出迅速发放拖欠工资，改善生活待遇，并为照顾工人健康，适当的缩减工时。各区工作组根据劳资两利原则，进行调解结果，厂方均接受了工人的合理要求，将工作时间由十一小时改为十小时，并对工资作合理调整，如华中印刷厂的工资，已由过去每人每日玉米面五斤到十三斤，增至七斤到十六斤。新天津橡胶工厂更由工人厂方合组评定工资委员会，根据技术高低，劳动力强弱，责任的轻重，对每人工资作适当评定。工人生活条件获得一定保障后，生产情绪随之提高，生产效率也日见增强。新天津橡胶工厂过去每出产一百付带里有四十付残带，而现只有四、五付。亨兴泰铁工厂过去出品（铁钉、铁丝）每日不足七十斤，现在达一百二十斤。保丰面粉机器厂过去八十个工人一个月只能制面粉机三、四部，现在二十六个人就能制造一至二部。华中印刷厂的胶版机每日印刷量由九千张增到一万张。新天津橡胶工厂工人满意的说：“这回可差不多了，过去是劳资一利（指资方），这回可是真正的劳资两利了。”保丰厂的厂主也满意的说：“这比以前还合算，每天十个钟点比过去十一个钟点干活还多。”
