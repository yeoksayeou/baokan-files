　　What is the difference between the profits of enterprises in socialist countries and the profits pursued by capitalism?
To the Editor:
    In the article "On the Great Significance of Socialist Competition" published on page three of the People's Daily on January 28th, there are phrases such as "making socialist enterprises obtain more profits" (in the past, news about Soviet enterprises' competition often mentioned "increasing profits"). I don't understand: how are the profits of socialist enterprises mentioned here generated? What is the difference between them and the profits pursued by capitalists in capitalist society? I hope you can explain this to help us understand the actual situation of socialist production competition in the Soviet Union.

Comrade Wenyuan: Here is a brief reply to your question:
    The profits obtained by socialist enterprises and the profits obtained by capitalists in capitalist society differ primarily in their sources: In capitalist society, capitalists own the means of production, and the products produced also belong to the capitalists. The sole purpose of capitalists employing workers for production is to exploit the surplus value created by workers' labor; or in other words, to pursue profits. Suppose a capitalist hires one hundred workers to produce for one day, and they produce goods worth one million yuan. The value of these one million yuan worth of goods is created by the workers' labor. The capitalist does not lift a finger. If we deduct ten thousand yuan (hypothetically) for the depreciation of factory buildings and machinery, and thirty thousand yuan for purchasing raw materials, fuel, and electricity from this one million yuan, then the remaining six hundred thousand yuan should belong to the workers. However, the distribution in capitalist society is not like this at all. After deducting the depreciation of production tools and the cost of raw materials, the capitalist only pays the workers the living expenses necessary to prevent them from starving to death and to continue producing for him from the remaining six hundred thousand yuan. This expense is only half or even less of the six hundred thousand yuan, and the rest is exploited by the capitalist. The capitalist's profit comes from exploiting the labor value created by the workers. The labor value taken away by the capitalist is called surplus value. From this, we can know that the profit obtained by capitalists in capitalist society comes from exploiting the surplus value of workers.
    The source of profits for socialist enterprises is completely different from this. In socialist society, the means of production belong to all the working people, and all the value created by all the working people is enjoyed by the working people themselves. Under the socialist system, because labor value is distributed according to the principle of "from each according to his ability, to each according to his work," the wage system still exists. Workers receive a certain wage based on the amount of value they create through labor. The products produced are still taken to the market for sale by the state's trading organs. Although the amount of wages a worker receives in a day may not necessarily be equal to the value of the goods he produces in a day, the total amount of cultural education, social security, entertainment, and other welfare benefits they can enjoy, plus the material enjoyment that wages can buy, must be equivalent to the total value of their labor. In socialist society, as workers' cultural level, scientific knowledge, and awareness rapidly improve, they continuously improve technology, improve organization, and save raw materials, fuel, electricity, and labor in the production process, which improves the quality of products while reducing costs. Such products are not only welcomed by consumers when sold in the market, but also generate higher profits. From this, we can know that the profits of socialist enterprises come from workers consciously improving production technology, creating tools, increasing production, and saving raw materials. Of course, this kind of profit is also generated by workers' labor, but this kind of profit, unlike the profit privately owned by capitalists, is not only used for the luxurious and extravagant parasitic life of a few capitalists; or to transform a part of the profit into capital to engage in expanded reproduction, in order to exploit workers more. Socialist society is based on the principle of "he who does not work, neither shall he eat." No one lives a parasitic life. The profits obtained by socialist enterprises still belong to all the working people and are used for the continuous development of production and the improvement of people's living standards. Therefore, the greater the total profit of capitalists in capitalist society, the more it signifies the increasingly cruel exploitation of workers by capitalists, and the more impoverished the lives of the working people will inevitably become. The more profits various enterprises in socialist countries have, the more it signifies the increasing improvement of production technology, the increasing reduction of production costs, and the inevitable rise in the living standards of all the people.

### 社会主义国家企业的利润与资本主义追逐的利润  有何区别？

专栏：询问与答复

　　社会主义国家企业的利润与资本主义追逐的利润  有何区别？编辑同志：
    一月二十八日人民日报三版所载“论社会主义竞赛的伟大意义”一文中，有“使社会主义企业取得更多的利润”（以前所发表的关于苏联企业竞赛的消息中，也常有“增多利润”的说法）等词句，我不明白：这里所说的社会主义企业的利润是怎样产生的？与资本主义社会中资本家所追逐的利润有什么不同？希望你们解释一番，以帮助我们理解苏联社会主义生产竞赛的实际情况。
    　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　读者　李文渊文渊同志：你所提出的问题，我们简复如下：
    社会主义企业中所获得的利润与资本主义社会资本家所获得的利润，首先是来源不相同：资本主义社会中，资本家占有生产资料，生产出来的东西，也归资本家所有。资本家之所以要雇用工人从事生产的唯一目的，就是为了剥削工人劳动创造出来的剩余价值；或者说就是为了追逐利润。假定一个资本家雇用了一百个工人进行了一天的生产，就产生了价格一百万元的物品的话，这一百万元物品的价值是工人劳动创造出来的，资本家并没有动手，在这一百万元里除去了厂房、机器的折旧（假定）十万元，买原料、燃料、电力三十万元，那末所剩下的六十万元，就该是工人所有了。但是资本主义社会里的分配完全不是这样的，除去生产工具的折旧，除去原料的成本，所剩下的那六十万元，资本家只付给工人以不致饿死而能够替他继续生产所必需的生活费用，这费用只是这六十万元的一半或者更少，其余就被资本家所剥削了，资本家的利润就是这样剥削工人创造的劳动价值而来的。被资本家占去的劳动价值，就叫做剩余价值，由此可知，资本主义社会资本家所获得的利润是从剥削工人剩余价值而来。
    社会主义企业的利润的来源，与此丝毫不相同。社会主义社会中，生产资料，归全体劳动人民所有，一切劳动人民所创造出来的价值，都归劳动人民自己享受。在社会主义制度下，因为是依照各尽所能，各取所值的原则分配劳动价值，所以工资制度还存在，工人凭劳动所创造的价值的大小，取得一定的工资，生产出来的物品还是由国家的贸易机关拿到市场上出售，工人一天所得到的工资数目，虽然不一定就等于他一天所生产物品的价值，但是他们所能够享受到的文化教育、社会安全、娱乐等福利与工资所能购买物质享受的总和，一定是相当于他们劳动价值的总和。在社会主义社会中，由于工人的文化水平、科学知识以及自觉程度迅速地提高起来，在生产过程中就不断的改进技术，改进组织，节省原料、燃料、电力、人力，使生产品的质量提高了，但成本却减低下来。这样的产品在市场出售，不仅受到了消费者的欢迎，而且也获得了更高的利润。由此可知，社会主义企业的利润是由于工人自觉的改进生产技术，创造工具，增加生产品，及节省原料而来。当然这种利润也是由工人劳动产生的，但这种利润，不是如资本家私人占有的利润那样，只用之于资本家少数人的奢侈淫逸的寄生生活；或者把一部分利润转化为资本，从事扩大再生产，以便更多的剥削工人。社会主义社会是“不劳动者不得食”，没有一个人过着寄生生活，社会主义企业获得的利润，仍为全体劳动人民所有，用之于继续发展生产，提高人民生活水平。所以，资本主义社会中资本家的利润总和越大，就标志着资本家对工人的剥削越发残酷，劳动人民的生活就必然越发穷困。社会主义国家各种企业的利润越多，就标志着生产技术的愈益提高，生产成本的愈益减低，全体人民的生活就必然越发上升。
