Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 24th—The officers and men of the mutinied cruiser Chongqing, led by Captain Deng Zhaoxiang (Colonel), arrived safely in Shenyang on the morning of the 19th, where they were warmly received by the leaders of the Northeast Military Region of the People's Liberation Army, the Northeast People's Government Committee, and the Northeast Bureau of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party. Captain Deng and all officers and men expressed their willingness to serve the construction of the People's Navy to the end.

Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 25th—The cruiser Chongqing, the largest vessel in the Kuomintang Navy, staged a mutiny on February 25th, breaking away from the reactionary Kuomintang government. It sailed to Yantai on the 26th and then to Huludao on the 4th of this month. In both locations, it received a warm welcome from the local People's Liberation Army, the People's Government, and the masses. The vicious and determinedly anti-China American imperialists and the reactionary traitorous Kuomintang government, in order to prevent the Chinese people from establishing their own maritime defenses, dispatched multiple B-24 heavy bombers with American insignia in shifts over Huludao on the 17th, 18th, 19th, and 20th of this month, bombing the ship continuously. On the 19th, they finally destroyed the ship and sank it on the 20th. To prevent the ship from being transferred, the U.S. Navy dispatched three submarines to the Huludao sea area on the 19th. The Chongqing incident once again exposed the crimes of American imperialists in armed intervention in China's civil war, and once again made the Chinese people and peace-loving countries around the world recognize the hideous face of American imperialists. The means by which American imperialists and the reactionary Kuomintang dealt with the Chongqing are reminiscent of the same methods they adopted against Liu Shanben's B-24 heavy bomber that flew to Yan'an in 1946. They destroyed one of Liu Shanben's planes, but they could not stop more than a dozen other planes from continuing to mutiny.

　  重庆号巡洋舰起义
    邓兆祥舰长率官兵抵沈美蒋勾结竟将该舰炸沉
    【新华社沈阳二十四日电】起义的巡洋舰重庆号官兵在舰长邓兆祥上校率领下，已于十九日晨安抵沈阳，受到人民解放军东北军区、东北政务委员会、中国共产党中央东北局各首长的热烈招待。邓舰长及各官兵表示今后愿为建设人民海军而服务到底。
    　　　　美蒋破坏重庆号引起人民痛恨
    【新华社沈阳二十五日电】国民党海军中最大的舰只巡洋舰重庆号，于二月二十五日举行起义，脱离国民党反动政府，于二十六日驶抵烟台，本月四日驶抵葫芦岛，在两处都受到当地人民解放军、人民政府和人民群众的热烈欢迎。穷凶极恶决心与中国人民为敌的美帝国主义者和国民党反动卖国政府，为了禁止中国人民建立自己的海上的国防，竟于本月十七日、十八日、十九日、二十日连续出动有美国国徽的Ｂ２４式重轰炸机多架前往葫芦岛上空轮番狂炸，至十九日终将该舰炸毁，并于二十日将其炸沉，为了阻止该舰转移，美国海军曾于十九日出动潜水艇三艘到葫芦岛海面。重庆号事件，又一次暴露了美帝国主义者武装干涉中国内战的罪恶，使中国人民和全世界爱好和平的国家又一次认清了美帝国主义者的狰狞面目。美帝国主义者和国民党反动派对付重庆号的手段，使人回想起他们在一九四六年对付刘善本驾到延安的Ｂ２４式重轰炸机所采取的同样办法。他们炸毁了刘善本的一架飞机，但是都无法阻止十几架飞机继续起义。
