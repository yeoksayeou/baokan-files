Xinhua News Agency, East China, 28th: The East China Support-the-Front Committee has successfully completed the merit evaluation and demobilization of over 20,000 civilian laborers from the Jiaodong, Bohai, and Lu Zhongnan regions. This demobilization effort, which lasted for a month, began on January 10th and ended on the 10th of this month. All civilian labor teams rewarded all heroes and model units. Through merit evaluation and work review, a large number of Party members were developed, and a large number of cadres were promoted.

During the merit evaluation, the East China Support-the-Front Committee, based on the characteristics of each region, organized four civilian laborer management offices to lead the merit evaluation work separately. In order to complete the evaluation in the shortest possible time, various localities adopted the method of evaluating civilian laborers as they arrived. As a result, the merit evaluation work was completed quickly. According to the statistics of the Fourth Civilian Laborer Management Office, among the 61,000 civilian laborers in the Jiaodong and Bohai labor teams, 50,596 were rated as heroes, including 129 special-class heroes. The stretcher teams of the First and Fourth Sub-districts of Bohai, the Beizhao (newly established Beizhao County in Zhaoyuan) stretcher team of Jiaodong, the Rudi stretcher team, the Haiyang porter team, the Weihai porter team, the Hainan stretcher team, the Yinan stretcher team, and the Sishui transportation team were all rated as model units, receiving more than 70 award banners. Special-class heroes and model cadres leading civilian laborers were awarded round badges with Chairman Mao's image. During the merit evaluation and work review, the civilian labor teams also carried out the work of developing Party members and evaluating cadres. According to incomplete statistics, the Jiaodong and Bohai civilian labor teams alone developed 7,259 Party members and promoted 2,046 cadres, including 554 township-level cadres, 222 district-level cadres, and 4 county-level cadres.

After the merit awarding, each team arranged for returning to their villages and held celebration meetings. At the meeting, most of the heroes put forward guarantees and challenges, stating that they would definitely do a good job in propaganda and support-the-army work after returning to the village, and strive to make contributions in production in the future. For example, Yu Chuanzhi, a special-class hero of the Third Squadron of the Haiyang Porter Team, recalled his personal transformation at the celebration meeting and said that he would definitely unite the village cadres and take the lead in organizing the employee groups after returning to the village. Qi Caifang of the Second Platoon of the Third Company of the First Battalion of the Yiyuan Stretcher Team challenged the villages at the celebration meeting: "Organize all the full laborers and semi-laborers after returning to the village. Reclaim the wasteland and help the military families plant the land first." The civilian laborers from various places have returned to their hometowns with glory in early February.

　　华东完成民工评功复员
  　各队回村生产立功
    【新华社华东二十八日电】华东支前委员会已顺利完成胶东、渤海、鲁中南三个地区二十余民工的评功复员工作。此次复员工作自一月十日起至本月十日止，共历时一月。各民工团队均奖励了所有的功臣与各模范单位，并通过评功、审工，发展了大批党员和提拔了大批干部。
    在评功中，华东支前委员会根据各区特点，共组织了四个民工管理处，分头领导评功事宜。为争取在最短时间内评完，各地采取了民工随来随评的办法。这样实行的结果，使评功工作很快完成。据第四民工管理处统计，仅胶东、渤海民工队六万一千余人中，即有五万零五百九十六人被评为功臣，其中特等功臣即有一百二十九人。渤海一分区和四分区担架团、胶东北招（招远北新设县）担架团、乳地担架团、海阳挑工队、威海挑工队、海南担架团、沂南担架团、泗水运输团等均被评为模范单位，共得奖旗七十余面，特等功臣及带领民工的模范干部均被奖以上有毛主席像的圆形奖章。在评功审功中民工团队还进行了发展党员和鉴定干部的工作。据不完全统计，仅胶东、渤海民工团队即发展了党员七千二百五十九人；提拔干部二千零四十六人，内乡级干部五百五十四人，区级干部二百二十二人，县级干部四人。
    评功奖功后，各团队即布置了回村工作，并召开了庆功会。会上，大多数功臣又提出了保证与挑战，表示回村后一定好好宣传和作好拥军、生产工作，求得今后在生产中立功。如海阳挑工三中队特等功臣于传志在庆功会上回忆了个人的翻身经过，表示回村一定好好团结村干，带头把员工组组织起来。沂源担架团一营三连二排齐才方，在庆功会上向各村挑战：“回村把全劳力半劳力全组织起来。把荒地开起来，先帮助军属种上地。”现各地民工已于二月初先后荣归故里。
