　　The Broad Masses of the People of Beiping City Gather to Discuss and Resolve to Defend World Peace

　　[This Newspaper] The movement against the instigators of new wars and to defend world peace has gradually unfolded in Beiping City. Over 150 people in the study class of the First Branch of the Preparatory Committee of the Beiping-Tianjin Clothing Factory held enthusiastic discussions on the issue of defending world peace and opposing the war conspiracy of American imperialism on the 22nd. They unanimously agreed that American imperialism is the instigator of war, and the Soviet Union is the pillar of defending world peace, and a friend of peace-loving people all over the world. During the discussion, the workers spoke very actively. Female worker Liu Shulan said: "The Americans don't respect us Chinese. They harass women, rape women, and help the Kuomintang massacre the Chinese people. Therefore, we must unite with peace-loving people all over the world and fight American imperialism to the end." Ye Yunkun said: "The Soviet Union aided us during the Anti-Japanese War. We must unite with the Soviet Union to stop the war." Zhang Shuqin said: "The Chinese people can only defend peace more effectively by carrying the revolution through to the end!" Li Chengshi said: "We proletarians must unite strongly to prevent world war from breaking out."
　　　　“We must work hard, support the front, and enrich our national strength!”
Zhao Guangjian and others said: "We must stick to our posts, support the front, work hard, learn from the People's Liberation Army, establish a new attitude toward labor, and enrich our national strength!"
　　　　“Don’t make weapons of murder for the aggressors.”
The Beiping Post Office Workers Study Group spent all its time yesterday (23rd) discussing the Xinhua News Agency's editorial on the 19th, "All the Peace Forces of the World Mobilize to Crush the Conspiracy of the War Provocateurs." Every worker who participated in the study spoke actively, and finally unanimously agreed to unite the world's peace forces and defend world peace. Domestically, we must carry the revolution through to the end and defeat the reactionary forces. In order to accomplish this goal, we must work together to support the front. Huang Zhongmin of the Postal Remittance Bureau said: "We must broadcast to workers and peasants all over the world, not to directly or indirectly manufacture weapons of murder and military supplies for the imperialist aggressors, and to unite all oppressed and small nations in the world to protest the consistent aggression of the imperialist aggressors."
　　The Jibei Power Company pointed out in its wall newspaper yesterday (23rd): We can assert from the experience of mankind's two world wars that the aggressors who launch wars will eventually fail. The closer the American imperialists are to launching a world war, the closer they are to their demise. Wang He of the company said: "We have absolute confidence that we will defeat the few with the strength of the majority. The most important issue now is how to expose the conspiracy of the provocateurs and make the people recognize their own strength. We must awaken the people of the world to see clearly who is the enemy and who is the friend, stand with the friend, and not fall into the tricks of the imperialists."
　　The workers' study group of the Long Distance Station of the Beiping Telecommunications Bureau responded to the world peace movement and jointly issued a statement saying: "We workers are a powerful mainstay in the ranks of opposing the danger of a new war. We must exert collective strength to smash the conspiracy of the war provocateurs. Worker representatives must bring this will to Paris."
　　[This Newspaper] More than 1,400 railway workers in the Beiping District (including railway worker representatives from Changxindian, Fengtai, Beiping-Tianjin Railway Administration, Beiping-Hankou Railway Bureau, etc., and railway workers from Xizhimen, Qianmen, etc.) held a rally at 6 pm yesterday (23rd) in the auditorium of the Beiping-Tianjin Railway Administration to support the convening of the World Peace Congress. At the meeting, Comrade Liu Jianzhang, First Deputy Director of the Beiping-Tianjin Railway Administration, delivered a speech, hoping that the railway workers in the Beiping District would widely carry out the movement to defend world peace, which was warmly welcomed by the workers attending the meeting.
