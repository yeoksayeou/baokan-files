    Inquiries and Replies
　　What is the legal age for marriage?
To the Editors:
    In the Inquiries and Replies column of the People's Daily on December 31st of last year, there was an item about whether a large age gap between a man and a woman would affect the ability to marry? The reply mentioned that: legally, the marriage age has no restrictions other than that men under 20 and women under 18 are not allowed to marry.
    However, Article 11 of the Provisional Marriage Regulations in the "Compilation of Laws and Decrees" states that "men under 18 and women under 16 shall not marry." Which of these is correct? Hoping for a reply.
　　　　Xu Huaigong

Xu Huaigong Comrade:
    Currently, there is no unified regulation on the age of marriage. In the Jin-Cha-Ji area, it is stipulated as 20 for men and 18 for women; in the Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu area, it is stipulated as 18 for men and 16 for women. Before a unified regulation is promulgated, it should be handled according to the regulations of the area in which you reside.

　　Returning “Betrothal Gifts” Cannot Be a Condition for Divorce
To the Editors:
    We have a question we hope you can answer.
    There is a divorce case: The woman is 22 years old this year, and the man is 30 years old. They met through an matchmaker, and got married on February 28th last year. Their relationship soured within a month of the marriage, and the man repeatedly beat the woman, leading her to live with relatives. The woman also stopped engaging in production. The situation remains the same. Therefore, the woman filed for divorce with the government last October, with the following conditions: (1) The relationship between the two parties is fundamentally incompatible. (2) The man constantly beats and verbally abuses her, making it impossible to live a good life. (3) The woman is determined to divorce, but the man disagrees. At the government office, the man demanded that the woman return the betrothal gifts from their marriage before he would agree to a divorce. The woman refused to return them, arguing that the betrothal gifts were given voluntarily by the man at the time of the engagement and have already been used up. Ultimately, the judicial section ruled: (1) Divorce is granted. (2) The woman must return three bolts of small cloth to the man.
    Is this handling appropriate?
　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　Jianping County Women's Federation

Jianping County Women's Federation:
    The woman's request for divorce due to the man's abuse should be approved. "Betrothal gifts" are a type of donation, and returning them cannot be a condition for divorce.

　　Women Should Take Their Due Property When Divorcing
To the Editors:
    If a woman files for divorce before receiving a land ownership certificate and does not explicitly request to take her property (not because she is willing to give up her property rights, but because she is unaware of the policy), can it be stipulated in the divorce decree that she can take her due share of the property?
    In the case of Li Laigou and Li Canglian from Zheng Village, the woman is determined to take her property with her after divorce. The man and his father went to the county and special district offices and cried, adamantly refusing to let her take it. If the ruling allows the woman to take her property, it may be difficult to enforce, but we cannot accommodate the man's wishes and deprive the woman of her property rights. How should this be resolved?
    Wang Qiujie from Beibaizhuang in the Second District and Li Yun from Xibaizhuang have been constantly arguing and fighting since their marriage. Last September, Wang Qiujie filed for divorce with the district, but after several attempts at mediation by the district and village, it was ineffective (the woman is determined to divorce, but the man is adamantly opposed). They were referred to the county, but due to a heavy workload, the issue was not resolved in time. Now, the man has joined the army, and the woman is requesting a divorce from the county. Should the divorce be granted?
　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　Zhao Jianmin, Judicial Section of Huolu County

Zhao Jianmin Comrade:
    The answers to your questions are as follows: (1) When approving a woman's divorce, she should take her own property with her. If the woman is not aware of the policy and does not express an intention to take her property, we should explain the policy to her and seek her opinion. Regarding the issue of Li Laigou and Li Canglian, village cadres and the masses can be mobilized to persuade the man and his father. (2) Regarding the issue of Wang Qiujie and Li Yun from the Second District, cases filed before Li joined the army should be treated as general marriage cases. If the relationship between Wang and Li is broken and they cannot continue to live together, the divorce should be granted. If a divorce was requested but not adjudicated before the man joined the army, it should be handled according to the specific circumstances before he joined the army.

专栏：询问与答复

    询问与答复
　　结婚年龄到底多少岁为合法？编辑同志：
    去年十二月三十一日人民日报上询问与答复栏内，有一项是男女年岁悬殊是否能结婚？答复最后提到：结婚年龄在法律上除男不满二十岁，女不满十八岁不得结婚外，没有其他的限制。
    但“法令汇编”上婚姻暂行条例上第十一条是“男不满十八岁，女不满十六岁者不得结婚”，这两个到底那个对？希答复。　　　　　　
　　　　徐怀功徐怀功同志：
    目前结婚年龄尚未统一规定，晋察冀规定为男二十岁，女十八岁，晋冀鲁豫规定为男十八岁，女十六岁。在统一规定公布以前，应按所在地区规定处理。

　　退“采礼”不能作为离婚条件编辑同志：
    我们有一个问题希望答复。
    有一个离婚的事情：女方今年二十二岁，男方三十岁，他俩是经介绍人介绍后，双方见了一面，在去年二月二十八日结的婚。结婚不过月余双方感情就不合了，后来男方不断的打女方，以致女方常住亲戚，女方也不从事生产了。现在还是如此。因此女方在去年十月向政府提出离婚，条件是：（一）双方感情根本不合。（二）男方不断打骂，不能好好的过日子。（三）女方坚决离，但男方不离，到政府后男方提出叫女方把他俩结婚时的采礼给交出才离，女方坚决不交出，其理由是因为采礼是订婚时男方自愿给的。而且现已全部用完。最后司法科处理：（一）准予离婚。（二）女方给男方退出小布三匹。
    这样处理是否合适？　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　建屏县妇联建屏县妇联：
    女方因不堪男方虐待请求离婚，应该批准。“采礼”是一种赠与关系，不能以退“采礼”作为离婚条件。

　　离婚时女方应带走应得财产编辑同志：
    在领工地证前妇女提出离婚，并未提出带产（她不是愿意放弃财产权，而是不了解），在判决离婚时，是否可以注明带走应得的一份财产呢？
    郑村李来狗和李仓莲离婚，女方要坚决带产，男方父子二人到县、专署哭哭啼啼，坚决不给她，如果判决让女方带走财产恐执行不通，又不能迁就男方去剥夺女方的财产权，应如何解决？
    二区北鲍庄王秋姐与西鲍庄李云结婚后，不断吵嘴打架，去年九月王秋姐曾到区提出离婚，经区村数次劝解无效（女方一定要离，男方坚决不离），介绍到县后，因工作繁忙未能及时解决，现男方已参加部队，女方到县要求离婚，是否准许离婚请答复。　　　　　　　　　　　　
　　获鹿县司法科赵健民赵健民同志：
    所提问题解答如下：（一）批准女方离婚，应将她自己的财产带走，如女方不明白政策，没有提出带财产的意见，我们应向她讲明政策，征求她的意见。至于李来狗与李仓莲的问题，可动员村干、群众向男方父子进行说服。（二）二区王秋姐与李云的问题，在李军前起诉的应以一般婚姻案处理，如王、李二人感情破裂不能继续同居，应准其离婚。如闹离婚未经判决而男方参了军，按其参军前具体情况处理。
