To Mr. Guan Zhizhi:

　　Since your brother joined the Northeast Liberation Army and was issued a revolutionary soldier certificate, your family should naturally be treated as a military family. You can take this certificate to the comrade in your district government who is responsible for civil affairs to resolve the issue. If you want to buy daily necessities like coal and grain, you can go to the North China Trade General Coal Company at No. 4 Dongjiaominxiang Xinghua Road and the Grain Branch Company at No. 22 Xuanwumenwai, respectively. The prices of grain and coal are relatively low there.

To Mr. Cheng Zhiyu:

　　Pre-war deposits have been almost completely devalued due to the Kuomintang government's several fraudulent currency reforms. The Banking Association is currently studying specific solutions on how to handle this situation, and an announcement should be made soon.

To Mr. Xu Zuhan:

　　Regarding whether your distillery can be returned, we have forwarded your letter to the Su County government and asked them to investigate and handle it. You can contact the county government directly.

To Mr. Tian Kungang:

　　The issue of merchants carrying banknotes, as mentioned in your letter, is indeed a problem that needs to be resolved. We have forwarded your letter to the relevant departments and asked them to study and resolve it.

To Mr. Ma Keqiang and Mr. Ji Hong:

　　Your suggestions to the Pingjin Railway Bureau regarding railway construction have been forwarded to the bureau's office for study.

To Mr. Zhang Qiliang and Mr. Li Enpu:

　　Your letter has been received. Please come to the social service group of this newspaper for a talk.

To Mr. Wang Wei and Mr. Zhang Xiangqi:

　　We do not know which school your letter refers to, so we cannot answer.

To Mr. Dong Xiaoling of the Social Service Group:

　　After seeing this notice, please come to the social service group of this newspaper between 1:30 PM and 4:00 PM to discuss everything in person. We will do our best to help you solve your difficulties.

To Mr. Zhang Gong:

　　The question about elementary school textbooks has been forwarded to the Education Department of the North China People's Government for resolution.

To Mr. Tian Miao:

　　Regarding your discovery of contradictions in the draft elementary school curriculum's time allocation and the actual situation in rural areas, we have forwarded the original letter to the Education Department of the North China People's Government.

　　社会服务关葸芝先生：
    你兄参加了东北解放军，并发给了革命军人证，家中当然应按军属待遇，可持此证到你区区政府找负责民政工作的同志解决。你想买日用煤粮，可分别到东交民巷兴华路四号，华北贸易总煤炭分公司，与宣武门外二十二号粮食分公司去买，那里粮炭价格比较低廉。程智宇先生：
    战前存款，因为国民党政府几次骗人的币制改革，折来折去，已经折得差不多没有了。现在究竟如何处理，银行公会正在研究具体办法，大约不久即可公布。许组翰先生：
    关于你的烧锅坊是否可退还？我们已将来信转苏县县府，请他们调查处理，你可迳向该县府接洽。田昆岗先生：
    来信所提商人携带钞票问题，确是应当解决的一个问题，我们已把你的信转到有关部门，请他们研究解决。马克强、纪宏先生：
    你对平津铁路局关于铁路建设方面的建议，已转该路局办公室研究。张启良、李恩浦先生：
    来信已收到，请来本报社会服务组一谈。王伟、张翔起先生：
    来信不知指的那个学校，无法作答。　社会服务组董小岭君：见报后，请于下午一点半到四点前来本报社会服务组面谈一切，我们尽量帮你解决困难。张恭先生：所问小学课本问题，已转华北人民政府教育部解决。田苗先生：你发现小学草案中，关于时间分配与农村实际情况有矛盾的地方。我们将原信已转华北人民政府教育部。
