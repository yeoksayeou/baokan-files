　　About the Atmosphere
　　Yi Feng

　　The Earth's surface is surrounded by an extremely thick layer of air. Due to the increasing development of science, not only do meteorologists need to study this atmosphere to predict weather and even further control weather changes in the future, but also radio communication specialists, aviators, and scientists studying cosmic rays are all working hard to study the atmosphere in order to solve many important problems related to cosmic rays, high-altitude flight, space travel, radio wave reflection, and so on. For many centuries, scientists have been working tirelessly, striving to fly higher and higher, but until now, the latest aircraft can only reach a height of about fourteen kilometers, stratospheric balloons can reach a height of just over twenty-two kilometers, and unmanned radio sounding balloons can only fly to about forty kilometers (based on 1937 materials). If even the extremely thin air is included, the thickness of the entire atmosphere is more than two thousand kilometers!

　　In recent years, scientists have obtained a new weapon in studying the high-altitude atmosphere—rockets. These rockets can carry measuring instruments to very high altitudes. The latest V-2 rockets have reached a height of one hundred and seventy-seven kilometers, which is naturally much higher than other tools. As a result of using high-altitude rockets for exploration, much new material has been obtained about the atmosphere.

　　It can now be considered that the entire atmosphere is divided into three layers: below eleven to sixteen kilometers is the troposphere, where drastic weather changes such as sunshine, clouds, wind, and rain occur; above the troposphere and up to seventy to ninety kilometers is the stratosphere, or isothermal layer. In fact, the temperature is not constant in this layer, but because water vapor is very scarce here, the weather is relatively calm, making it a very suitable area for high-speed flight; the highest layer is called the ionosphere, extending up to about two thousand kilometers, but the exact limit of this ionosphere is still not known. The air in the troposphere accounts for ninety percent of the total air weight, and its density and pressure are constantly undergoing drastic changes. Above the stratosphere, the air becomes very thin.

　　The entire atmosphere is a mixture of many gases, the main ones being oxygen, nitrogen, hydrogen, carbon dioxide, water vapor, and small amounts of many other gases: helium, argon, neon, krypton, and xenon, etc. In the troposphere, the air, not counting carbon dioxide and water vapor, contains about seventy-five percent nitrogen and twenty-one percent oxygen. As altitude increases, oxygen gradually decreases. Above sixteen kilometers, some oxygen molecules begin to split into atoms under the irradiation of sunlight. At an altitude of twenty to forty kilometers, oxygen atoms combine with unsplit oxygen molecules to form a molecule with completely different properties—ozone. Ozone forms an entire ozone layer in the atmosphere (twenty to forty kilometers above the ground). This layer plays a decisive role in protecting the Earth, filtering out strong ultraviolet rays from the sun's light like blotting paper, so that the ultraviolet rays that penetrate down do not cause damage to living organisms. Without this ozone layer, the entire Earth would become a desert.

　　It was previously thought that various gases in the atmosphere were arranged in height according to their atomic weight, with nitrogen and oxygen in the lower layer and hydrogen and helium in the upper layer, but this has now been proven not to be the case. The entire atmosphere is mixed together from top to bottom, and the upper atmosphere is mainly composed of nitrogen and oxygen, because the helium and hydrogen in it have been decomposed under the action of sunlight.

　　In the air, there are also large amounts of electrons, neutrons, protons, and others. To this day, people still do not fully understand what effect these particles have on the properties of the atmosphere. However, it is already known that changes in these particles affect the atmosphere's charge, and therefore have a great impact on radio wave reflection. Sunlight has a significant meaning for the Earth and the entire atmosphere. Sunlight contains huge amounts of inexhaustible energy. As a result of solar irradiation, many layers with different characteristics are formed in the atmosphere.

　　It was previously thought that the higher the altitude, the colder the temperature. In fact, this is only true to a certain extent. In the troposphere, the temperature can drop to a degree of 55 degrees Celsius from bottom to top. However, going up from twenty kilometers, the temperature rises rapidly, because a large amount of solar heat energy is stored in the ozone layer. After passing the ozone layer, the temperature drops sharply again, until entering the ionosphere, where the temperature gradually and continuously rises again.

　　关于大气层
    毅风
    地球表面包围着一层极厚的空气。由于科学的日渐发达，不仅气象学家需要研究这一大气层，以便预测天气以至将来进一步掌握天气的变化，而且无线电通讯家、飞行家、研究宇宙射线的科学家们也都极力在研究着大气层，以便解决有关宇宙线、高空飞行，宇宙旅行，电波反射等等方面许多很重要的问题。许多世纪来科学家们不倦地工作着，努力想要飞得更高，但是直到如今最新式的飞机所能达到的高度是十四公里左右，成层圈气球所能达到的高度是二十二公里多一些，不带人的无线电探测气球也只能飞到四十公里左右（以上是根据一九三七年的材料）。而如果连极稀薄的空气也计算在内的话，则整个大气层的厚度，竟有二千公里以上之多！
    近年来科学家在研究高空大气层方面，又已经获得了一种新的武器——火箭。这种火箭可以带着测量仪器升到极高的高空去。最新的Ｖ二式火箭已经达到了一百七十七公里的高度，这比起其他工具来，自然是高得多了。由于使用高空火箭来进行探测的结果，关于气层就获得了许多新的材料。
    现在已可以认为，整个大气分为三层：十一到十六公里以下为对流圈，或叫对流层，在这一层中进行着晴阴风雨等剧烈的天气变化；在对流圈上面直到七十至九十公里为成层圈，或叫同温层，事实上在这一层上并不同温，不过因为这里水蒸气非常稀少，所以天气是较平静的，是一个很适合于高速度飞行的地区；最高一层叫做离子圈直到二千公里左右，但这一离子圈究竟到哪里为止，至今还不能确实知道。在对流圈中的空气占全部空气重量的百分之九十，而且其密度与压力时时在进行着剧烈的变化。由成层圈以上，空气就非常稀薄了。
    整个大气乃是许多气体的混合物，其中主要的是氧气，氮气，氢气，炭酸气，水蒸气及少量的其他许多种气体：氦气，氩气，氖气，氪气及×气等，在对流圈中的空气，如不算炭酸气和水蒸气，约含百分之七十五的氮气，和百分之二十一的氧气，随着高度的增加，氧气也逐渐减少。到了十六公里以上，一部分氧气分子在太阳光的照射之下才开始分裂为原子。在二十到四十公里的高度上，氧气原子与尚未分裂的氧气分子结合成为一种性质完全不同的分子一臭氧。臭氧在大气层中形成了整个一个臭氧层（地面上由廿到四十公里）。这一气层对于保护地球起着决定的作用。尤如泸纸一般的太阳光中泸去强烈的紫外线，使穿透下来的紫外线，对生物不致有所损害。如果没有这个臭氧层？整个地球就成一片沙漠了。
    从前认为大气中各种气体依其原子量大小而排列高低，氮气、氧气等在下层，氢气、氦气等在顶层，现在证明并非如此。整个大气层由上到下乃是混杂一体，而高层大气主要由氮氧气所构成，因为其中的氦气和氢气在太阳光的作用之下都已分解了。
    在空气中还存在着大量的电子，中子，质子及其他等等。至今人们还不十分了解这些粒子对大气性质有何影响。但是已经知道这些粒子的变化影响到大气的带电量，因而对于无线电波反射有着很大的影响。太阳光对于地球及整个大气层有着重大的意义。太阳光中含有巨量的，取之不尽的能。由于太阳照射的结果，使大气中形成了许多具有不同特性的层。
    过去曾认为气温愈高愈冷。事实上这只是在一定的程度上是对的。在对流圈中，由底到顶，气温可以下降摄氏五十五度的程度。但是由二十公里再往上去，气温就很快的上升，这是因为在臭氧层中储存了大量的太阳热能。过了臭氧层以后，气温又急剧下降，直到进入离子圈，气温又逐渐不断上升起来。
