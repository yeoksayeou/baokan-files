　　Ping City Library Readers Extremely Numerous; Additional Mobile Library Stations Established - Serving Workers Exclusively
    [This newspaper reports] The readers of the Beijing City Library and the People's Education Center are extremely enthusiastic, demonstrating the eagerness of the people of Beijing for the new democratic culture and knowledge. In order to further satisfy the demands of the citizens, the Education Bureau of the Beijing Municipal People's Government has successively purchased more than 2,000 new books and distributed them to its affiliated units. Among the books, the most widely read are theoretical works such as "On New Democracy," "On Coalition Government," and "The Chinese Revolution and the Chinese Communist Party." Next are books related to various policies of the Party. Original works of Marxism-Leninism have also begun to be widely read. However, the current readers are mostly limited to students, general intellectuals, and citizens. Workers and other working people are still restricted by production and time, and cannot have sufficient reading opportunities. In order to remedy this defect, the Municipal Library is rapidly establishing mobile library stations to bring books to the hands of the workers. Among the twenty-seven applying units, the preparatory committee of the Pingjin Railway Qianmen District Workers' Union, the Telecommunications Machinery Repair Factory, and the Pingjin Clothing General Factory, among other thirteen worker groups, have established stations first. The Municipal Education Bureau is currently working on establishing people's education centers in worker areas such as Mentougou, Changxindian, and Shijingshan, and plans to establish worker literacy schools and half-day schools for workers' children in concentrated areas of workers and poor people in the city. Adult literacy classes and half-day schools for children in the Second District have already been established. The Municipal Library, People's Education Center, and Municipal Reading Room are also seeking to further directly serve the working class. The new democratic culture led by the proletariat will be more closely integrated with workers and the working people.　　　(Wan Zhongmin)

　　平市图书馆读者极多　添设巡回图书站  专为工人们服务
    【本报讯】北平市图书馆和民教馆的读者极为踊跃，表现了北平人民对于新民主主义文化求知的热切。北平市人民政府教育局为进一步满足市民的要求，特陆续添购新书二千多册分配各所属单位。书籍中，阅览人数最多的是新民主主义论、论联合政府、中国革命与中国共产党等理论书籍。其次是有关党的各种政策书籍，马列主义原著也开始为人们广泛阅读。但现有的读者中仍多限于学生、一般知识分子和市民。工人其他劳动人民还受着生产和时间限制，不能有充分的阅读机会。市立图书馆为弥补这一缺陷，正迅速举办巡回图书站，把书送到工人们的手里。在二十七个申请单位中，首先成立了平津铁路前门区职工筹备会、电信机械修理厂、平津被服总厂等十三个工人团体站。市教育局刻正着手建立门头沟、长辛店、石景山等工人区的民众教育馆，计划在城内的工人贫民集中地区成立工人补习学校和工人子弟半日学校。第二区成人识字班和儿童半日学校则已经建立。市立图书馆、民众教育馆和市立阅书报处亦正谋进一步直接服务于工人阶级。无产阶级所领导的新民主主义文化，将更益密切的和工人及劳动人民结合。　　　（万钟民）
