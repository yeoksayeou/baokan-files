Xinhua News Agency, Beiping, March 7th: After the Peiping Military Control Commission issued a proclamation on February 28th prohibiting the circulation and sale of silver dollars, the relevant departments conducted several days of persuasion in various silver dollar markets throughout the city. The majority of small-scale silver dollar vendors have largely complied with the measures set by the Military Control Commission and have voluntarily changed their professions. However, a small number of shops and silver dollar dealers have refused to repent and continue to engage in clandestine activities. In order to implement the ban issued by the Military Control Commission, the Peiping Public Security Bureau began to crack down on these activities on the 2nd. As of the 4th, 116 silver dollar vendors who refused to heed the warnings have been detained. After registration and persuasion by the bureau, they have been released. The confiscated silver dollars have been temporarily taken into custody by the Peiping branch of the People's Bank of China.

    【新华社北平七日电】平市军管会于二月二十八日布告禁止银元流通买卖后，经主管部门数日来在市内各银元市场进行劝导，一般零星贩卖银元者，大部已遵照军管会所定办法自动改业，但仍有少数商号和银元贩子不知改悔，暗中进行活动。平市公安局为了贯彻军管会所颁禁令，乃于二日起开始实行取缔，截至四日止，已先后拘获不听劝告的银元贩子一百十六人。他们经该局登记劝导后，已被释放。查获的银元则交由人民银行北平分行暂行保管。
