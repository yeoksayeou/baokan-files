Xinhua News Agency, East China, 9th. The East China Bureau of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the Political Department of the East China Military Region of the People's Liberation Army recently issued instructions calling on all government offices, troops, and schools to immediately mobilize and organize to actively help peasants with spring plowing and develop the spare-time labor production of government offices and troops. Government offices and troops in or near disaster areas should especially help peasants with production for disaster relief. Frontline combat troops should, without hindering combat, study, and action preparations, help local peasants with production as much as possible. The instructions further pointed out that six things must be paid attention to in helping with plowing and planting and disaster relief: (1) Conduct investigation and research around the stationed area. Cooperate with the local Party to formulate specific plans to help peasants with spring plowing and production for disaster relief. First, help the families of revolutionary martyrs, the families of revolutionary soldiers, the families of revolutionary workers, the families of cadres working in new areas, and the families of civilian laborers supporting the front lines. Secondly, help childless and widowed elderly, village cadres, and other ordinary peasants who lack labor. (2) Assist the local Party in conducting propaganda and mobilization work in stationed villages, improving peasants' enthusiasm for this year's spring plowing and their belief in production for disaster relief, and formulate practical production plans. (3) Organize the manpower, animal power, and vehicles of the unit, under the unified leadership of the local Party, to directly help peasants with delivering manure, weeding, and plowing the land, and, when necessary, use people instead of animals. (4) Government offices and troops in disaster areas and neighboring disaster areas must also carry out saving for disaster relief, help disaster victims solve the difficulties of food and seeds, and, where necessary and possible, organize special expedition teams to help solve the difficulties of spring plowing and spring planting in severely affected areas. (5) During the spring plowing period, it is strictly forbidden to arbitrarily assign corvée, abuse civilian labor and animal power, and damage peasants. Promote the past spirit of grinding and transporting military grain by ourselves. All personnel helping peasants with spring plowing and production must not solicit or accept any remuneration. (6) In areas bordering the enemy or edge areas, armed protection should also be organized for peasants to rush to plow and plant.
