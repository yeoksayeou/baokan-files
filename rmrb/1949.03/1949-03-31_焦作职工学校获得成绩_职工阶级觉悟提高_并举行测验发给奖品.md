Strengthen the Organization of Workers' Study

    【Taihang News】 Jiaozuo Workers' School has achieved great results since it opened three and a half months ago. When Jiaozuo was first liberated, the Propaganda Department of the Sub-district Federation of Trade Unions, in order to strengthen the education of workers, led everyone to establish the Workers' School. A total of 372 workers participated in the study, with classes held twice a week. Initially, they explained current affairs and policies, so that everyone realized the basis for defeating the Kuomintang reactionary government in about a year, which further boosted their enthusiasm for learning. Then, they lectured on Comrade Li Lisan's opening speech at the Labor University and the resolution on the workers' movement in the Liberated Areas passed by the Labor University. In the process of learning, the workers' consciousness gradually increased. For example, they said: "In the past, we took the enemy's coal to fight against the enemy. Now, do you see anyone taking coal? "The workers are carrying out production with the attitude of masters, and the output has greatly increased. Initially, although a small number of workers had a "support the differences" viewpoint in their minds, they slowly changed. Now, every time they have class, they compete to sit in the front, and the number of people who can take notes has increased to more than 50.
    In order to further strengthen learning and improve everyone's ideological awareness, the factory's school committee conducted a test on March 9th. A total of 239 workers from the Machine and Electrical Factory, Printing Factory, and Repair Shop participated in the exam, but two-thirds of them could not write. Except for a few who used written tests, oral tests were used.
    Each worker who took the test treated this test with extreme seriousness and caution. An old worker said: "I have been a worker all my life, and this is the first time I have taken an exam. In the old society, the factory manager only knew how to tell us to work hard, how could he ask us to study and take exams?" From the workers' answers, it can be seen that they have the most accurate understanding of the face of the Kuomintang Chiang Kai-shek. When asked about the purpose of the Kuomintang's peace conspiracy, they all unanimously replied that it was to catch their breath and reorganize to fight the People's Liberation Army again, and they would cite examples they had personally seen to prove it: For example, the day the Chiang bandit army attacked Jiaozuo in 1946, it was only a few days after the Kuomintang and American peace execution team left. Can we still be fooled by him today? When asked about the basis for our victory in about a year, in addition to stating the reasons, they also told of their personal suffering from the Kuomintang's oppression to prove that Chiang Kai-shek's military, political, and economic collapse was so rapid that it was simply expected. They are best at using the facts of comparison before and after liberation to prove that their beliefs are firm.
    On the evening of March 13th, a learning summary meeting of all workers was held, and the results of the test were presented.
    After the summary, the award results were announced and prizes were awarded. The award recipients received their prizes in the warm applause of the masses, and the meeting ended in enthusiastic cheers.
    The Jiaozuo Workers' Night School has started a new stage of learning.

    焦作职工学校获得成绩
    职工阶级觉悟提高
    并举行测验发给奖品
    【太行讯】焦作职工学校，开办三个半月以来，已经获得很大成绩。焦作刚解放时，分区职工会宣传部为加强对工人的教育，就领导大家成立了职工学校。参加学习的共有职工三百七十二人，每礼拜上课两次，开始讲解时事与政策，使大家都认识到一年左右打垮国民党反动政府的根据是什么，从而学习情绪更高涨起来，接着就讲授了李立三同志在劳大开幕词，劳大通过的解放区职工运动决议等，在学习中工人觉悟逐步提高，如说：咱们过去拿敌人的炭，是为了和敌人斗争，现在你看咱们还有一个人拿炭吗？工人都以主人翁的地位进行生产，产量大大提高。最初虽在一小部工人思想上存在着支差观点，以后慢慢的都改变了，现在每次上课，都争着往前边坐，能记笔记的人增加到五十余人。
    为了进一步加强学习，提高大家思想觉悟，该厂学委会于三月九日进行一次测验。机电厂、印刷厂、修械所的工友们参加考试的共二百三十九名，但不能写的就占三分之二，除了少数人用笔试外，都用口试的方法。
    每个应试的工人，都是极严肃而慎重的对待这次测验。一个老工人说：干了一辈子工人，下考场是头一回，旧社会厂长只知叫咱死力干活，哪里还叫咱们学习考试呢？从工人们的答案中，可以看到他们对国民党蒋介石的面貌认识得最为确切，在问到国民党玩弄和平阴谋的目的是什么时，都一致的回答是想喘喘气休整休整，再来打解放军，而且要引出他亲眼见到的例子来作证明：比如一九四六年蒋匪军向焦作进攻的那一天，正是国民党和美国人的和谈执行小组走了没有几天，难道我们今天还能再上他的当吗？问到我们一年左右胜利的根据时，他们除说出道理外，都还诉说了个人身受国民党压迫的痛苦以证明蒋介石在军事、政治、经济上崩溃之迅速，简直是意料中的事。他们最善于用解放前后对比的事实，来证明他们的信念是坚定不移的。
    三月十三日晚召开全体工人的学习总结大会，提出了在测验中的成绩。
    总结完毕后，便宣读评奖结果与发奖。受奖者在群众的热烈的掌声中领取了奖品，会议在热烈的欢呼中结束了。
    焦作职工夜校又开始了一个新的学习阶段。
