Care for the working people has always been the central focus of the Bolshevik Party. It is precisely this noble idea of ensuring that laborers live a truly human life that inspired the Bolsheviks to engage in a selfless struggle to overthrow landlords and capitalists, and guided laborers to overcome incredible difficulties in order to build a powerful socialist state from a formerly oppressed and backward Russia, and to lead laborers onto the broad path of a happy socialist life. There is no party in history that has consistently and selflessly fought for the interests of the working people and made such great contributions to our country's development as our Bolshevik Party and its great leaders—Lenin and Stalin.

"If," Comrade Stalin said in 1931, "every step in my life's work to improve the working class and consolidate the socialist state of this class was not aimed at consolidating and improving the position of the workers, then I would consider my life meaningless."

Constant concern for industrial and agricultural laborers, for scientific and artistic workers, and for the defenders of the sacred borders of the socialist motherland is the law of the Soviet state.

The Bolshevik Party, Lenin, and Stalin have always shown extraordinary concern for the men and women of the Soviet Army and Navy. When Lenin discovered that a Soviet serviceman or his family was not guaranteed their legal supplies and provisions, he took the strictest measures and unhesitatingly dealt with violators of Soviet law. Comrade Stalin was extraordinarily concerned about the difficulties of the military. Last year, when Comrade Stalin arrived at the cruiser "Molotov," he said to Kosygin, Deputy Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union, who was accompanying him: "Become more familiar with the life, food, clothing, and living conditions of the sailors. They are worthy of our good care."

The men and women of the Soviet Armed Forces feel the Bolshevik Party, the Soviet government, and Comrade Stalin's concern for them every day in practice.

The Soviet state has provided a large amount of material resources to ensure all the necessities of the Army, Navy, and Air Force, who are guarding the peaceful and creative labor of the Soviet people and guarding peace throughout the world. The responsibility of leaders and political organs at all levels lies in correctly utilizing these resources to ensure the normal life and study of the personnel of all units and schools, and to continuously improve the combat power of the Soviet Armed Forces.

Naturally, concern for subordinates should be expressed and primarily manifested in concern for their combat skills and political education. It is absolutely correct for commanders and political workers to show an unwavering spirit of strict demands when educating soldiers to fight according to all the teachings of advanced Soviet military art. A well-trained soldier is always sincerely grateful when he thinks of the strict commander who taught him to strike the enemy hard. However, concern for subordinates is not limited to training and education issues. Commanders, political organs, Party and Communist Youth League organizations should make the greatest efforts to ensure that Soviet soldiers feel cared for in all aspects (including the guarantee of material life) at all times. "All commanders and leaders must, when educating and training subordinates, care about their lives, food, equipment, and clothing, and ensure that soldiers can enjoy all the items and provisions they are entitled to in a timely and full manner." (Stalin)

Our regulations require daily concern for subordinates. "The leader," it says in the Internal Service Regulations, "should care about maintaining the health of his subordinates, understand their living conditions and needs; supervise whether all the supplies and provisions stipulated by the state are fully issued to them, and what the quality is; and help subordinates find solutions when necessary, and put forward suggestions for improvement to higher leaders."

The vast majority of commanders and political workers are truly fighting to ensure the accurate implementation of these regulatory requirements. They take timely and constant care to ensure that everyone lives comfortably in barracks and tents, and receives the stipulated supplies and provisions without interruption, so that the life of subordinates is very good. For example, Colonel Lavrentiev, the commander of a certain unit, is a leader who cares for his subordinates. After the troops arrived at the encampment, he paid great attention to the life, living conditions, and cultural and recreational work of the personnel. Everything is in good order in his barracks; the tents, classrooms, and political education studios are all equipped to make people feel comfortable; soldiers and non-commissioned officers are able to systematically read newspapers, magazines, and books; the dining hall is well-lit, comfortable, and clean, and the meals are prepared on time and are palatable.

Unfortunately, this situation is not the case everywhere. Inspections of the work situation in various places show that in some units and corps, there is a formalistic and indifferent attitude towards the life needs of the military and towards guaranteeing their stipulated supplies and provisions. In some places, inferior food is arbitrarily used to replace the stipulated food, and usually, this is without any sufficient reason. If it was sometimes necessary to make this substitution during the Great Patriotic War, then it is not permissible now.

Commanders, political organs, and Party organizations cannot take an indifferent attitude towards any aspect of the military's life. It must be understood that caring for the military is caring for the combat effectiveness of the troops and caring for the high political and spiritual mood of the personnel.

The conditions in which personnel live in tents or barracks must fully comply with the requirements of the Internal Service Regulations of the Soviet Armed Forces. "In the schedule of daily activities," the Internal Service Regulations state, "there should be seven hours of sleep, one and a half hours of rest during the day, and at least one hour of free time."

Soldiers, non-commissioned officers, and officers should be able to receive all stipulated supplies and provisions in a timely and complete manner. Every meal must not be delayed, nor can it be made unpalatable. The time between two meals should usually not exceed six hours. Commanders, administrators, and political workers must keep the kitchen and dining hall clean, hygienic, and orderly, and must systematically check the quality of meals, that is, they must resolutely implement the requirements of the Internal Service Regulations. Lack of organization in food management work often disrupts the internal order of the troops and hinders the completion of the study plan.

We must resolutely enhance the sense of responsibility of the troops' management personnel for their work. It is the sacred duty of the logistics organs to ensure that the troops have all the necessary supplies in a timely manner. The duty of the deputy commander in charge of supply and the quartermaster of the troops lies in being good at organizing the material guarantee for the personnel, paying constant attention to the condition of the warehouses, maintaining the integrity of the supplies, and properly arranging bathing facilities for the military. They must ensure that the personnel can eat on time and that the meals are palatable, and that the grain is properly conserved and stored. The Internal Service Regulations state that management personnel must constantly lead the work of the kitchen, dining hall, granary, bakery, and icehouse, and must also pay attention to the weighing and storage of items, organize the purchase, transportation, and acceptance of items; supervise the consumption of grain; conduct calculations of food supply, and pay attention to the timely and prepared submission of the accounts.

In organizing the daily life of the troops, as in daily service, it is not a small matter. Do not spare time and energy in caring for the normal living conditions of the troops. All management departments should do their work very successfully, and constantly supervise the work of cooks, warehouse directors, and odd-job personnel. Remember that the management platoon—this is not an "appendage," but the most important link in the entire troop organization. The life and study of the military depend heavily on their proficiency and initiative in their work. We must tirelessly educate the military personnel engaged in management work with iron military discipline and the spirit of faithfully fulfilling their duties. We must constantly care for the soldiers and non-commissioned officers in this department and not allow them to be separated from military and political study, and not allow them to be left unattended.

However, the guarantee of the material life of the personnel is not only the responsibility of the management staff. Commanders at all levels must personally understand all the details of the lives of soldiers, non-commissioned officers, and officers every day, and lead the work of material supply for the troops.

In ensuring the daily needs of Soviet soldiers, the squad leader, especially the quartermaster, plays a huge role. They live among the soldiers at all times and are the first to understand all their needs. Their duty lies in immediately taking measures to overcome all shortcomings and ensure that soldiers receive the stipulated supplies and provisions, or reporting any shortcomings discovered to higher levels.

The political organs, Party, and Communist Youth League organizations have a major responsibility for ensuring the material life and cultural and recreational activities of the personnel. They have a responsibility to use their entire work organization to help the commanders ensure all the necessities for the troops' normal study without interruption. The responsibility of the political organs and Party organizations is to deeply understand the various problems in the material living conditions of the personnel and to constantly discuss them at Party meetings. Political workers should be more in contact with the lives of the soldiers and masses, listen to their opinions, and take decisive measures to correct any shortcomings discovered.

The cultural and recreational work of the military and the extracurricular activities of the personnel during their free time, especially on rest days, are of particular importance. The Internal Service Regulations require that during this time, "mass political activities and cultural education work, as well as sports competitions and games," be conducted. Our military should be able to watch movies and dramas, as well as programs they perform themselves, be able to listen to reports, lectures, and discussions, read newspapers, magazines, and books, send letters, and participate in sports games and competitions. The political organs and Party organizations are fully responsible for organizing and conducting all cultural and educational activities in the troops, and are responsible for the work of the club and the political education studio.

The armed forces are now conducting summer training, which is the most important period of military training. All field exercises should be as close to actual combat as possible. These exercises, such as completing combat missions by long marches, require extreme physical and mental exertion from the troops. Therefore, ensuring that the personnel get adequate rest and are well-fed requires special concern and special flexibility in dealing with these issues from the management departments and all military officers. No matter where—on the march, during combat exercises, or in the field camp—they should always be guaranteed hot meals and all other stipulated items. The large amount of materials supplied by the Soviet state to the armed forces personnel must be truly spent according to the prescribed quota.

Genuine concern for the Soviet military is the most important responsibility of every commander and political worker, and every Party and Communist Youth League organization. It is the most important condition for completing the military and political education of the troops, and it is the guarantee for further improving the power of the Soviet Armed Forces.

### 对下级日常的关心是指挥员和政治工作人员的头等职责

　　对下级日常的关心是指挥员和政治工作人员的头等职责
    对劳动人民的关怀，经常是波尔什维克党注意的中心。正是保证劳动者过着真正人的生活这一崇高的意念，鼓舞了波尔什维克去进行推翻地主和资本家的奋不顾身的斗争，引导了劳动者克服难以置信的困难。以便从过去一个受压迫和落后的俄国，建立成强大的社会主义国家，以便引导劳动者走向幸福的社会主义生活的宽阔的大道。历史上没有这样一个党，它能象我波尔什维克党及其伟大的领袖——列宁和斯大林，那样一贯地与奋不顾身地为劳动人民的利益而斗争，为我国发展作了极大的贡献。
    “假使，——一九三一年斯大林同志说道，——在我生平为提高工人阶级和巩固这一阶级的社会主义国家的工作中的每一步骤，不是为着巩固和改善工人的地位，那末我认为自己的生活是毫无目的的了。”
    对工业与农业劳动者，对科学与艺术工作者，以及对社会主义祖国神圣边疆的保卫者的经常关心，乃是苏维埃国家的法律。
    波尔什维克党，列宁和斯大林，任何时候都对苏维埃陆海军军人们表现了异常的关心。当列宁发现某一苏维埃军人或其家庭没有保证其法定的用品和给养时，他便采取最严格的手段，毫不姑惜地对待苏维埃法令的破坏者。斯大林同志异常关心军人的困难。去年斯大林同志到达“莫洛托夫”巡洋舰，向其同行的苏联部长会议的副主席科西金说道：“要更熟悉水兵们的生活、给养、服装和起居条件。他们是值得我们很好地去关心的。”
    苏联武装部队的军人们，每天都实际地感到波尔什维克党、苏维埃政府和斯大林同志对自己的关心。
    苏维埃国家拿出了大批的物质资材来保证海陆空军的一切必需品，他们在警卫着苏维埃人民的和平的创造的劳动，警卫着全世界的和平。各级首长和政治机关的责任，在于正确地利用这些资源来保证各部队和学校人员的正常生活与学习，来不断提高苏维埃武装部队的战斗威力。
    自然，对下级的关心应当表现和首先表现在关心他们的战斗素养和政治教育。指挥员和政治工作人员在教育士兵按照先进的苏维埃军事艺术的一切教范作战时，应表现出不屈不挠的要求严格的精神，这是绝对正确的。受过优良训练的军人，一想起曾教会他痛击敌人的要求严格的指挥员时，总是衷心感激的，然而对下级的关心，不只是限于训练和教育的问题。指挥人员、政治机关、党和少共组织，应以最大的努力，使得苏维埃军人时时刻刻感到在各方面（其中亦包括物质生活的保证）都对自己关心。“一切指挥员和首长，教育与训练下级时，必须关心他们的生活、给养、设备和服装，关心军人们能及时与充分享受到一切规定发给他们的物品和给养。”（斯大林）
    我们的条令要求对下级做到日常的关心。“首长，——在内务条令里说道，——应当关心保持自己下级的健康，了解他们的生活状况和需要；国家规定给他们的用品和给养是否全部发给，及其质量如何，应实行监督；必要时要帮助下级想办法，并在上级首长面前提出改进的意见。”
    绝大多数的指挥员和政治工作人员，是真正为确切的执行此等条令的要求而斗争的。他们及时地与经常地关心着，使每个人员在营房和帐篷里住得舒适，不间断地领到规定的用品和给养，使下级的生活起居很好。例如，某部队指挥员拉夫廉基耶夫上校，他就是一个关心下级的首长。部队到达宿营地后，他极注意人员的生活起居和文化娱乐工作。在其营房里一切都是井井有条；帐蓬、教室及政治教育工作室都是设备得令人感觉舒适；战士和士官能够有系统地阅读报纸杂志和书籍；食堂里光线充足，舒适整洁，饭菜到时作好而又适合口味。
    可惜是，此种状况并不是到处都是如此。对各处的工作状况的检查，说明着在某些部队和兵团中，对军人的生活需要，对保证他们的规定的用品和给养上，存在着形式主义的与漠不关心的态度。某些地方随意用恶劣的食物代替规定的食品，同时，通常这是没有任何充足的理由的。如果说在伟大的爱国战争时期，有时这种代替是必要的话，那么现在是不能允许的。
    指挥员、政治机关和党的组织，对军人生活的任何一面，都不能持漠不关心的态度。必须了解，关心军人乃是关心部队的战斗力，关心人员的高度的政治精神的情绪。
    人员住在帐篷或营房中的条件，要完全符合于苏联武装部队内务条令的要求。“在起居时间表中，——内务条令里说道，——应有七小时的睡觉时间，一点半钟的白天休息时间，至少有一小时的自由支配的时间。”
    士兵、士官和军官们应能及时地全部领到一切规定的用品与给养。每顿饭不能迟误时间，也不能作得不好吃。前后两餐的时间，通常不应超过六小时。指挥员、管理人员和政治工作人员必须使厨房、食堂清洁卫生，井然有序，有计划地检查饭菜的质量，即是要坚决执行内务条令的要求。在伙食管理工作中的缺乏组织性，经常会使部队的内部秩序凌乱，妨害学习计划的完成。
    必须坚决提高部队管理人员对自己工作的责任心。后勤机关的神圣职责，是要适时保证部队有一切的必需品。部队管供给的副指挥员和辎重粮秣员的职责，在乎善于组织对人员的物质保证，经常注意仓库的状况，保持辎重物品的完好无损，好好地给军人安置洗澡的设备。他们必须使人员能按时用餐和菜饭可口，对粮食作适当的爱惜和保管。内务条令里载明，管理人员必须经常领导厨房、食堂、粮库、面包房及冰室的工作，还要注意物品的过秤和放存，组织物品采买、运送和收纳；监督粮食的消费；进行对食品供给的计算，并注意及时与准备的呈报本金的帐目。
    在组织部队日常生活上，通常亦如日常勤务一样，不是一件小事情。在关心部队的正常的生活状况上，不吝惜时间与精力。一切管理部门，都应把工作做得很有成绩，经常监督炊事员、仓库主任和勤杂人员的工作。要记住，管理排——这不是一个“附属物”，而是整个部队组织里的最重要的一环。军人的生活起居以至于学习，多有赖于他们工作上的熟练和主动性。要不疲倦地以铁的军事纪律与忠实履行自己的职务的精神，教育作管理工作的军人们。必须经常关心这一部门的士兵与士官不要脱离了军事政治学习，不要对他们放任不管。
    然而人员物质生活的保证，不只是管理工作人员的事情。各级指挥员每日都要亲自了解战士、士官和军官们的一切生活细节，领导部队的物质供给工作。
    在保证苏维埃士兵日常需要上，班长特别是司务长，起着巨大的作用。他们时刻生活在士兵中，是第一个能了解他们一切需要的人。他们的职责，在于立即采取办法，克服一切缺点，保证士兵得到规定的用品和给养，或把所发现的缺点按级报告。
    对人员的物质生活与文化娱乐活动的保证，政治机关、党与少共组织皆负有重大的责任，他们有责任以其工作的整个机构，帮助指挥员不间断的保证部队正常学习的一切必需品。政治机关和党的组织的责任，是深刻了解了员物质生活状况中的各种问题，经常在党的会议上来讨论它们。政治工作人员，应多接触士兵群众的生活，倾听他们的意见，采取坚决的办法改正一切发现的缺点。
    军人的文化娱乐工作，人员自由时间的课余活动，特别是在休息日中，有特殊重要的意义。内务条令要求在这一时间里进行“群众政治活动和文化教育工作，以及体育竞赛与游戏”。要使我们的军人能够看上电影、话剧以及自己扮演的节目，能听上报告、讲演和座谈，阅、读报纸，杂志和书籍，寄信，参加体育游戏与竞赛。政治机关和党的组织、完全负责组织和进行部队中的一切文化教育活动，负责俱乐部与政治教育工作室的工作。
    现在武装部队进行和夏季学习，正是军事训练的最重要的时期。一切野外演习应最低限度里近乎实战情况。这些演习，作长途行军来完成战斗任务等，要求部队在体力与精神上都极端紧张，因此要使人员得到适当的休息和吃的饱，这就要求管理部门，要求一切军官人员特别关心，特别灵活的处理这些问题。无论在什么地方——在行军中，在战斗演习时或在野营里——经常应保证他们吃到热饭热菜，得到其他一切规定的东西。要使苏维埃国家供给武装部队人员的大批物质，确实地按照规定额开支。
    对苏维埃军人的真正关怀，是每个指挥员和政治工作人员，每个党与少共组织的最重要的职责，是完成部队军事政治教育的最重要的条件，是进一步提高苏维埃武装部队威力的保证。（朱允一译自苏联武装部队总政治部出版的“宣传者和鼓动者”杂志。）
