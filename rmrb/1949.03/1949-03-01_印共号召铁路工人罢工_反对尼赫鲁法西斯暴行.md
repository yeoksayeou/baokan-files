　　Indian Communist Party Calls for Railway Workers' Strike
    Against Nehru's Fascist Atrocities
    Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 27th – Agence France-Presse, Bombay: The Indian Communist Party issued a statement on the evening of the 24th, denouncing the Indian government's nationwide arrest of communists as a "fascist suppression" of workers' and trade union rights. The statement said: "Indian Prime Minister Nehru and Deputy Prime Minister Patel are attempting to obtain loans from the United States through an anti-communist movement and to obtain the leadership of an Asian group under the protection of imperialism." The Indian Communist Party urged millions of railway workers to go on strike on March 9. The statement also claimed that the Indian government is preparing to openly and shamelessly participate in the Asian version of the Atlantic Pact - the so-called Pacific Pact and the Anglo-American military alliance - in order to oppose the Soviet Union and New Democratic China.

    反对尼赫鲁法西斯暴行
    【新华社陕北二十七日电】法新社孟买讯：印度共产党于二十四日晚发表声明，痛斥印度政府对共产党人所发动的全国规模的逮捕，是对工人及工会权利的“法西斯镇压”。声明称：“印度总理尼赫鲁及副总理巴特尔企图借反共运动来使自己能获得美国的贷款，并取得一个在帝国主义庇护下的亚洲集团的领导资格。”印共敦促百万铁路工人在三月九日实行罢工。声明同时声称，印度政府已在准备公开无耻地参加大西洋公约的亚洲版——所谓太平洋公约及美英军事联盟，借以反对苏联及新民主的中国。
