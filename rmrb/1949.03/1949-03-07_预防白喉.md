　　Preventing Diphtheria

　　Diphtheria has now been discovered in the Jianping area, and one child has already died. As spring arrives and the weather is dry, this disease is most likely to spread and become epidemic. Nearby residents should pay close attention to prevention.
　　Diphtheria is an acute infectious disease. White membranes form in the patient's throat, which may seem similar to common tonsillitis. However, diphtheria is absolutely different from tonsillitis. Diphtheria is caused by a special pathogen called "diphtheria bacillus." Its inflammation can not only invade the tonsils, but also invade the nose upwards and the throat downwards. Therefore, diphtheria can cause children to suffocate and die because they cannot breathe through their throats. Moreover, the toxin of diphtheria bacillus is very strong. Once a child is infected with diphtheria bacillus, although the fever is sometimes not as high as in severe tonsillitis, the symptoms of systemic poisoning are very obvious, especially prone to affecting the circulatory system. Therefore, diphtheria can also cause children to die from systemic poisoning due to heart paralysis.
　　Diphtheria is particularly likely to invade children. Children under six months old often have a certain degree of short-term immunity, so the incidence rate is relatively low. After six months, the incidence rate gradually increases. Children aged one to seven have the highest incidence rate. People over fifteen years old rarely suffer from diphtheria. Among children suffering from diphtheria, the younger the age, the more likely it is to cause suffocation and heart failure. Among children suffering from diphtheria, the earlier the diagnosis and the earlier the treatment, the greater the hope of recovery. To diagnose diphtheria, doctors must not only quickly judge from local and systemic symptoms, but sometimes also quickly perform bacterial examinations on throat secretions. The most important (and arguably only) way to treat diphtheria is to inject diphtheria antitoxin serum. Sulfa drugs and penicillin have no therapeutic effect and can only prevent complications. Recovered children should also rest well for several weeks, because there is often a risk of heart failure during the recovery period.
　　Diphtheria is transmitted, firstly, through direct contact with patients; secondly, through contact with things that patients have only used recently; and thirdly, it can also be transmitted by milk contaminated with diphtheria bacilli. The most troublesome thing is that some people are called "carriers." Their mouths carry diphtheria bacilli, but they do not get sick themselves, but can transmit the bacteria to others.
　　To prevent diphtheria, "diphtheria toxoid" can be injected, but it does not take effect as quickly as vaccination. It often takes several months after injection for it to develop resistance to diphtheria. During a diphtheria epidemic, in addition to a few children who have had direct contact with children with diphtheria who can be injected with diphtheria antitoxin serum for prevention, the main thing is to strictly avoid infection. This requires: First, children who have developed diphtheria must be strictly isolated until the throat secretions are free of diphtheria bacilli (approximately three weeks after recovery). Second, people who have been in contact with sick children should not come into contact with others, especially not with other children. Third, in agencies where diphtheria has occurred, agency nurseries should be temporarily dissolved and live scattered in their respective homes. In nearby agencies where diphtheria has not occurred, it is best for children to also be dispersed in their respective homes and temporarily stop children's group activities. Fourth, kindergartens and elementary schools should strictly cut off contact with the outside world, stop receiving guests, and all staff members should not go out except for purchasing personnel. No one except childcare workers should be allowed to approach children. Purchasing personnel should be strictly prohibited from approaching children. Childcare workers should wear masks and change and wash them frequently. Fifth, things used by sick children should be strictly disinfected. Sixth, prevent children from suffering from colds, tonsillitis, measles, whooping cough, etc., because when children have diseases of the throat or upper respiratory tract, diphtheria bacilli can easily enter. Seventh, for children who have been in contact with sick children, fine salt powder can be sprinkled in the throat area once a day, which is beneficial and harmless. Eighth, any discovery of diphtheria should be reported to the local health authorities at any time.

### 预防白喉

　　预防白喉
    梁桐
    建屏一带现在发现白喉病，并已有一小儿死亡。时届春令，气候干燥，此病最易蔓延流行，附近居民，应加紧注意预防。
    白喉是一种急性传染病，从病人嗓子发生白膜，看来似乎和一般常见的扁桃腺炎有些相象。但是白喉与扁桃腺炎有绝对的不相同处。白喉是由一种特殊的病原体叫做“白喉杆菌”所引起的，它的炎症不仅能侵犯扁桃腺，而且可以向上侵犯到鼻子，向下侵犯到喉咙，所以白喉病可以使小儿因喉咙透不过气而窒息致死。并且白喉菌的毒素很强，小儿一旦被白喉菌所传染，虽然有时候发热不及重症扁桃腺炎那样高，但是全身中毒的症状很明显，特别是容易侵犯到循环系统，所以白喉病又可以使小儿因全身中毒而致心脏麻痹死亡。
    白喉特别容易侵犯小儿，半岁以下的小儿，常因带有相当程度的短时免疫，发病率较小，半岁以后，发病率逐渐增高，一岁到七岁的小儿，发病率最高，十五岁以后患白喉的人就很少了。在患白喉的病儿当中，年龄愈小，愈容易发生窒息，发生心脏衰弱。在患白喉的病儿当中，诊断愈早，治疗愈早，治愈的希望亦愈大。诊断白喉，医生不仅要很快地从局部症状和全身症状来判断，有时候还需要很快地将嗓子的分泌物做细菌的检查。治疗白喉，最主要的（也可以说是唯一的）办法是注射白喉抗毒血清；磺胺和青霉菌素都没有治疗的效果，仅能防止合并症。已治愈的小儿还应好好休息数星期，因为在恢复期中，往往还有心脏衰弱的危险。
    白喉的传染，第一是由于直接和病人接触；第二是由于接触了病人才用过不久的东西；第三也有由被白喉菌污染了的牛乳传染的。最麻烦的事是有一部份人叫做“带菌者”，他们的口腔里，携带着白喉菌，他们自己不得病，可是能够把菌传给别人。
    预防白喉，可以注射“白喉类毒素”，但是它不象种痘那样会短时生效。它发生抵抗白喉的作用，常常要在注射的几个月之后。在白喉流行期间，除少数和白喉病儿直接接触过的儿童可以用白喉抗毒血清注射预防外，主要还是靠严格地避免传染。这就需要：一、把已发生白喉的小儿要严格地隔离起来，直到嗓子的分泌物已经查不到白喉菌时为止（大约病愈后三星期左右）。二、接触过病儿的人不要和别人接触，特别是不要和别的小孩子接触。三、在已发生了白喉的机关，机关托儿所应该暂时解散；分散地在各自家里生活。没有发生白喉的附近机关，小儿也最好做到分散在各自家里，短时停止小儿集体活动。四、保育院、小学校应严格与外界断绝来往，停止会客，除采买人员外，所有工作人员都不准外出。除保育员外，别人都不让接近小儿。采买人员更应严禁接近小儿。保育员应戴口罩，勤于换洗。五、病儿用过的东西都应严格消毒。六、要防止小儿患感冒、扁桃腺炎、麻疹、百日咳等，因为当小儿的嗓子或上气道有病时，白喉菌易于乘虚而入。七、对于接触过病儿的小孩子，可以用精盐粉末，散布在嗓子的地方，每日一次，有益无损。八、凡有白喉发现，应随时报告当地卫生机关。
