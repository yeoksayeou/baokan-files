The Parliament finally voted on the ruling party's proposal, that is, the declaration approving the government's decision to join the North Atlantic Treaty, at 6 a.m. The result was as follows: 531 members of parliament participated in the voting, of which 342 voted in favor of the government's proposal, 170 opposed, and 19 abstained.

After several incidents occurred between opposition and ruling party members, the Parliament resumed meeting to vote on the following motion proposed by Togliatti: After the vote on the new government proposal, the Lower House recommends that no foreign government be given the right to use Italian territory to establish military bases. Gasperi demanded that the Lower House reject this proposal: Togliatti's proposal was rejected by 317 votes to 175.
