    [Jidong Telegraph] Through rural branches, female party members, and activists mobilizing the broad masses of women to participate in agricultural and sideline production, achievements have been made in the Ninth District of Baodi. Most women in the district not only participate in general agricultural and sideline production labor, but also participate in major labor such as plowing, sowing, filtering manure, and autumn harvesting. For example, in Banjiegou Village, with 32 households, female party members Sun Guiqing and Sun Fengyan led women to compete with men in agricultural production. During the slack season, they also organized 14 women to open a tofu workshop, earning more than ten shi (each shi is 200 jin) of beans and three fat pigs in two months. Among the 127 young and middle-aged women in Shihuangcao Village, except for 38 young girls who were too weak, all participated in agricultural mutual aid teams. Female party members Qian Guilan and others have learned techniques such as plowing, sowing, and filtering manure. In Wangjianzhuang Village, under the leadership of female party members Zhang Sulan and Zhang Guilan, 80 percent of women participated in spring plowing and autumn harvesting. In addition, 31 women went into the water to fish (women in this area have never had this custom) twice, catching 370 jin of fish, buying nine shi of red grain, and subsidizing the shortage of food before the autumn harvest.
