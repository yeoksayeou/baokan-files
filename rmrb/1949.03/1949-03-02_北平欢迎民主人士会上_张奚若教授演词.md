Xinhua News Agency, Beiping, February 28th. Professor Zhang Xiruo of Tsinghua University delivered a speech at the Beiping welcome meeting on the 26th: Today's gathering can be said to be a grand reunion of various democratic parties and many non-party democratic personages in China today. This grand reunion is also a kind of great unity. In the past, we were scattered in various places, and it was not easy to discuss matters, so our actions could not help but be slow. From today onwards, everyone can live together, and everything will naturally be easier to discuss, easier to coordinate, and easier to take common action. This is a necessary condition for establishing a new social order today. We did not have this condition before, but we have it today, which is naturally worth celebrating.

Now I want to talk about what I personally particularly admire about the many democratic fighters who have come to Beiping from various places today. What I want to say is entirely sincere and from the bottom of my heart. I hope everyone will not regard it as ordinary "courtesy" or "social talk."

First of all, what I want to say is that I personally admire the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang and its leader, Mr. Li Renchao, very much. My admiration has a special reason: the Kuomintang has been enslaved and exploited by that big rogue Chiang Kai-shek for the past twenty years, which is truly a great shame for Kuomintang members with personality, blood, and conscience. This shame has been somewhat washed away only since the emergence of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang. This washing away is worthy of our admiration.

Secondly, needless to say, the China Democratic League is also something I have always admired. This is because it has been able to cooperate with the CCP's policies in general since the Political Consultative Conference a few years ago. This is where it has worked hard in the past, and it is probably its future policy as well. We should all be grateful. Mr. Shen Hengshan, as an old man of seventy-six years old, braves the cold and heat, fears no hardships, travels across mountains and rivers, and dedicates himself to national affairs, which is especially worthy of respect from us younger generations.

In addition, there are several other democratic political groups, such as the China Association for Promoting Democracy led by Mr. Ma Yichu and the China National Democratic Construction Association organized by many friends, which I have also greatly admired for many years. They have always been active in places where Chiang Kai-shek's rogue claws were the most numerous, secret agents were the most rampant, and danger was the greatest. Their fearless spirit is indeed admirable.

Finally, of course, I would also like to pay tribute to many friends who have no party affiliation or organizational affiliations. Mr. Guo Moruo's efforts in the academic field and Mr. Mao Dun's efforts in the literary field for the democratic revolution have been praised unanimously, regardless of north or south, old or young. It is not surprising that I have never met these two famous revolutionary giants in the academic and literary circles before. This opportunity to meet them is a great pleasure for me. There are many non-party democratic personages present today, but due to time constraints, I cannot mention them all. I will just take Mr. Guo Moruo and Mr. Mao Dun as representatives.

Finally, I would like to thank the organizers of today's meeting for giving us all this opportunity for a grand reunion. Needless to say, this grand reunion is built on the three great victories. Without the victories of the three major battles of Northeast China, North China, and Huaihai, today's grand reunion would be unimaginable. Therefore, I would like to especially thank the organizers of today's welcome meeting, especially the armed comrades among them.

　　北平欢迎民主人士会上
  　张奚若教授演词
    【新华社北平二十八日电】清华大学教授张奚若在二十六日北平欢迎会上演词：今天这个聚会，可以说是中国今天各民主党派及许多无党无派的民主人士的大团圆。这个大团圆同时也就是一种大团结。以前我们大家分散在各处，遇事商讨不易，行动时也就不能不迟绥。今天以后大家可以同居一处，一切自然比较容易商量，容易配合，容易采取共同行动。这是今天建立新社会秩序的必要条件，这个条件我们以前没有，今天有了，自然值得庆幸。
    现在我要说说我个人对于今天由各处来到北平的许多民主战士特别钦佩的地方。我所要说的完全是十分诚恳的由衷之言，希望大家不要当作平常“客套”看，不要当作“应酬话”看就好了。
    首先，我所要说的是，我个人对于中国国民党革命委员会和它的领导人李任潮先生是非常钦佩的。我的钦佩有一个特别理由：国民党在最近二十年来被蒋介石那个大流氓所奴役所利用，这实在是有人格有血性有良心的国民党党员一种莫大的耻辱。这种耻辱，自有中国国民党革命委员会出现，才多少洗刷掉一点。这个洗刷是值得我们钦佩的。
    其次，用不着说，中国民主同盟也是我向来所敬佩的。因为它从几年前政治协商会议以来在大体上都能和中共的政策配合。这是它已往努力所在的地方，这大概也是它将来的政策，我们都应该感谢。沈衡山先生以七六高龄的老人，不避寒暑，不畏艰险，跋山涉水，奔走国事，尤其值得我们后辈的人钦敬。
    此外，还有几个民主政治团体，例如马夷初先生所领导的民主促进会和许多朋友所组织的民主建国会，也是我数年来非常敬佩的。它们向来都是在蒋介石那个大流氓爪牙最多、特务最厉害、危险性最大的地方活动，其大无畏的精神确实使人佩服。
    最后，我当然还要向许多没有党派、没有团体组织的朋友们致敬。郭沫若先生多年来在学循界、茅盾先生在文艺界，对于民主革命的努力，是无问南北，不分老少，一致赞扬的。说来不奇怪，我和这两位大名鼎鼎的学术界和文艺界的革命巨子是素昧平生的。这次得有机会见面，在我一方面，真是愉快万分。今天在座的无党无派的民主人士很多，因为时间关系，不能多举，只拿郭沫若茅盾两先生作为代表罢了。
    末了，我要感谢今天这个会的主持人，感谢他们给我们大家这个大团圆的机会。这个大团圆，用不着说，是建立在三大胜利之上的。没有东北、华北、淮海三大战役的胜利，今天这个大团圆是根本不能想象的。所以我最后还是要特别谢谢今天这个欢迎会的主持人，尤其是其中的几位武装同志。
