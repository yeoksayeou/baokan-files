　　[Beiping Telegram] Since liberation, workers in Beiping City have begun to establish new work attitudes, resulting in widespread improvements in production efficiency in many factories and the emergence of a large number of activists. In the forging workshop of the Changxindian Railway Machinery Factory, workers used to require at least 0.1312 work-hours per fishplate under Kuomintang rule, but now only 0.095 work-hours are needed. Before liberation, manually driving in 1,000 track spikes required 5.5 work-hours, but now only 5 work-hours are needed. Workers in the equipment protection section of the Shijingshan Power Plant completed the major overhaul and cleaning of No. 1 mercury pump in just two hours, five hours less than the fastest time before liberation. More than ten workers in the section refused to stop working when it was time to get off work while rushing to repair the No. 2 coal extractor, and as a result, they completed eight hours of work in a four-hour blitz. Three employees of the civil engineering section traveled eleven kilometers on foot within three hours to inspect the Sanjiadian water channel, and they declared that they did not want travel allowances. The power generation of the plant on February 4 was 30,000 kilowatts, which had increased to 33,500 kilowatts by February 23, thus ensuring that the lights throughout Beiping City could shine brightly. Workers at the 70th Arsenal also launched a production competition movement under the slogan of "Production must be fast, materials must be saved, and dimensions must be accurate." Worker Lei Hengbao's output on the 17th exceeded the highest quantity designated by the factory under Kuomintang rule by 38.1%. In some departments of the factory, not only did the production quantity increase compared to before liberation during this production competition, but the quality also greatly improved. For example, in a certain department under Kuomintang rule, out of 8,000 items shipped, there would be 1,500 defective items, but now it has been reduced to just over ten. On the 18th, the number of defective items produced by worker Hou Shaofeng was reduced from the original 300-plus to four. Currently, the workers of the factory have put forward the slogan of "Surpassing the highest record of productivity under Kuomintang oppression" to ensure the completion of the production plan.
　　Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, March 3rd. Many enterprises and factories in this city that have been taken over by the Military Control Commission and have resumed work have seen their productivity exceed pre-liberation levels over the past month, and in many cases even exceed the highest records during Kuomintang rule. The maximum power generation of the First Power Plant of the Tianjin Branch of the Jibei Electric Power Company reached the safety limit of the generator - 21,500 kilowatts - on February 22, exceeding the highest record before liberation. Most of the important factories using the plant's electricity have resumed work, and the use of power by small factories in the eastern district of Tianjin is no longer restricted. Less than a week after resuming work on the day after the liberation of Tianjin, the output of the Tianjin Paper Company's Second Factory increased from 1.5 tons per day before liberation to two tons. The daily output of fishplates at the Iron and Steel Fittings Factory No. 1 has surged to more than ten tons, greatly exceeding the highest record of six to seven tons per day before liberation, and the quality is also better than before. The daily output of car tires, bicycle tires, inner tubes, car fan belts, storage battery casings, and car belts produced by the Rubber Fittings Factory has increased by 40% to 76% compared to before liberation; the proportion of first-class finished products in the total output has increased from 85% before liberation to 95%. Before liberation, the Tianjin Oxygen Plant averaged 80 barrels of oxygen per day, but in the first three days of resuming work after liberation, it averaged 133 barrels of oxygen per day. The Tianjin Municipal Enterprise Company Nail Factory produced only 716 jin of iron wire on December 1 last year before liberation, while on the 5th of last month, it reached 1,045 jin. On the third day of resuming work, the Tianjin Chemical Company broke the highest record of 72 jars (25 liters per jar) under Kuomintang rule by producing 73 jars of hydrochloric acid per day. On January 25, the Dongya Cigarette Factory started 12 cigarette-making machines and produced only 26 boxes of cigarettes (50,000 cigarettes per box), but by February 11, it started 16 cigarette-making machines and produced 57 boxes of cigarettes. From February 15 to 17, the total daily output of the Dongya Flour Mill increased from 6,185 bags (22 kilograms per bag) to 6,312 bags in three days.
　　The high level of labor enthusiasm shown by the workers of the aforementioned public enterprises in resuming production is an important reason for the increase in production efficiency. The phenomenon of workers arriving late and leaving early in many factories has gradually disappeared. Some even try not to waste a minute of time in production. Workers at the Iron and Steel Fittings Factory now light the furnaces before starting work, ensuring that work starts on time and overcoming the phenomenon of delayed start-up due to lighting the furnaces after starting work in the past. In order to keep the machines running during lunch breaks, the Rubber Fittings Factory changed the method of all workers resting and eating at the same time to rotating meals. Some factories also try to closely coordinate various departments in the production process to overcome disconnections, which is also a factor in increasing production.

　　平津不少公营企业
  　生产率超过解放前
    工人表现高度劳动热诚　误时浪费现象逐渐消灭
    【北平电】解放后的北平市工人已开始树立新的劳动态度，因而在不少工厂，已普遍提高了生产效率，涌现出大批积极分子。长辛店铁路机厂锻工场工人，在国民党统治时每块夹板至少需用零点一三一二工，现在只要零点零九五工。解放前人工打尖道钉每千个需用五点五工，现在只要五个工即可。石景山发电所经护股工人，在大拆清洗一号给汞时，仅二小时就完了工，比解放前最快的工时少五小时，该股十多个工人，在赶修二号抽煤机时，到了下班时间都不肯停工，结果四小时突击完成了八小时的工作。土木股的三个职工，为了检查三家店来水沟，曾在三小时内徒步往返十一公里。声明不要外勤费。该厂在二月四日的发电量是三万基罗瓦，到二月二十三日已增高至三万三千五百基罗瓦，因此保证了全北平市的电灯能够大放光明。七十兵工厂的工人，在“生产要快，材料要省，尺寸要准确”的口号下，也展开了生产竞赛运动。工人雷恒宝在十七日一天内的生产量超过了国民党统治时厂方指定的最高数量百分之卅八点一。该厂某些部门，在这次生产竞赛中，不仅生产数量上比解放前增加，而且品质也大大提高了。譬如某部门在国民党统治时，出货八千个中，即有废品一千五百个，现在已减少到十多个。十八日那天，工人侯少峰在生产的货品中，废品即由原来的三百多个减到四个。现在，该厂工人，已提出了“超过国民党压迫下生产率的最高纪录”口号，以保证生产计划的完成。
    【新华社天津三日电】经本市军管会接管并已复工的许多企业工厂，一个多月来生产率均超过解放以前甚至不少超过国民党统治时期的最高纪录。冀北电力公司天津分公司第一发电厂的最高发电量，二月廿二日已临到发电机的安全界限——二万一千五百千瓦，超过了解放前的最高纪录。现使用该厂电力的重要工厂，已大部复工，津市东区的小工厂使用动力亦不再受限制。天津纸业公司第二厂从津市解放翌日复工后不到一周，产量由解放前每日一吨半，增至两吨。钢铁配件厂一厂鱼尾板的日产量，已激增至十吨以上，大大超过了解放前日产六、七吨的最高纪录，质量也较前优良。橡胶配件厂所出产的汽车外带、自行车外带、内带、汽车风扇带、蓄电瓶外壳、汽车皮带等日产量均比解放以前增加百分之四十至七十六；所产一等成品在总产量中的比例，由解放前的百分之八十五升到百分之九十五。天津养气厂解放前平均日产养气八十桶，解放后复工的最初三天中，就平均日产养气一百三十三桶。天津市企业公司制钉厂，去年十二月一日解放前铁丝的产量仅七百一十六斤，而上月五日则达一千零四十五斤。天津化学公司复工的第三天，就以日产盐酸七十三坛（每坛二十五公升），打破国民党统治时七十二坛的最高纪录。东亚烟厂一月二十五日开动卷烟机十二台，只产烟二十六箱（每箱五万支），到了二月十一日，开动卷烟机十六台，产烟五十七箱。东亚面粉厂二月十五日到十七日三天内，全厂每日总产量由六千一百八十五袋（每袋二十二公斤）增到六千三百一十二袋。
    上述公营企业的工人在复工生产中表现的高度劳动热忱，是使生产效率提高的重要原因。许多工厂中工人迟到早退的现象，已逐渐消灭。有的更在生产中尽量不浪费一分钟时间。钢铁配件厂工人在上工前先生好炉子，做到按时做工，克服了过去上工后生炉子以致开工延迟的现象。橡胶配件厂为了中午休息吃饭时不停机器，将全体休息吃饭的办法改为轮流吃饭。有些厂在生产过程中尽量使各部门密切配合，克服脱节现象，也是使生产提高的因素之一。
