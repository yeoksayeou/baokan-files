Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 4th -- Reports from various sources: The Dutch government simultaneously issued communiqués in The Hague and Batavia on February 26th, announcing its new plan to ensure the colonial enslavement of the Indonesian people. The communiqué announced that the Dutch government had decided to release Indonesian Republic government leaders such as Hatta and Sukarno, who had been captured by the Dutch military, in order to use Hatta and others to divide the guerrillas, based on the plan proposed by the United States. The communiqué also announced an invitation for Hatta and others to go to the Netherlands to participate in the "Round Table Conference" scheduled for March 12th in The Hague; it announced that the Netherlands would transfer "sovereignty" to the "Federal Government of Indonesia," including Hatta, "earlier" than the American plan adopted by the Security Council on January 28th, and invited "all relevant parties, including members of the United Nations Indonesian Committee," to attend the "Round Table Conference" in The Hague. However, the Dutch government also announced that the agreement of the "Round Table Conference" must be passed "unanimously" to be valid.

　　The Dutch government's plan for the Indonesian issue is the result of recent discussions between the Dutch High Commissioner to Indonesia, Beel, and the Dutch cabinet after Beel returned to the Netherlands. Beel is one of the representatives of the Dutch colonialist group in Indonesia. He hurriedly returned to the Netherlands in mid-February, after the Dutch Minister of Overseas Colonies, Sassen, resigned under pressure from the United States. According to Agence France-Presse on February 16th, Beel "did not entirely agree" with the Dutch government's concessions to the U.S. policy towards Indonesia. At the same time as Beel's return to the Netherlands, while the Dutch parliament held fierce debates on the Indonesian issue, "hard-line" members of the Catholic Party in parliament heavily attacked the Dutch cabinet's concessions to the United States. Party member Weert stated: "Dutch troops are fighting for a cause that is no longer our own" (TASS).

　　According to Agence France-Presse on February 26th, citing the views of so-called well-informed sources in The Hague, the Dutch government's new decision is intended to satisfy the American-controlled Security Council, while keeping the power to initiate and control future "negotiations" in the hands of the Netherlands. However, according to a United Press International dispatch from Batavia on February 26th, the American-controlled Indonesian Committee expressed dissatisfaction with the Dutch new plan. A spokesman for the committee stated: "The Indonesian Committee will hand the entire issue back to the Security Council for handling on March 1st." After the U.S. expressed its attitude, Sukarno and Hatta, who were detained on Bangka Island, also refused the Dutch invitation on the 28th.

### 根据美帝意见　荷公布奴役印尼新计划

　　根据美帝意见
  　荷公布奴役印尼新计划
    【新华社陕北四日电】各方报导：荷兰政府于二月二十六日同时在海牙与巴达维亚两地发表公报，公布其确保对印尼人民的殖民地奴役的新计划。公报宣布，荷政府决定释放哈达、苏加诺等被荷军俘掳的印尼共和国政府首脑，以根据美国方面提出的计划，利用哈达等人来分裂游击队。公报又宣布邀请哈达等人到荷兰去，参加订于三月十二日举行的海牙“圆桌会议”；宣布荷兰将比安理会一月二十八日通过的美国计划，“更早地”将“主权”移交给包括哈达在内的“印尼联邦政府”，并邀请“一切有关方面，包括联合国印尼委员会人员”在内，列席海牙的“圆桌会议”。然而，荷政府却又宣布：“圆桌会议”的协议，必须经过“一致”的通过，方属有效。
    荷兰政府对印尼问题的这一计划，是荷驻印尼高级专员比尔最近返荷与荷内阁商讨的结果。比尔是荷兰在印尼的殖民者集团的代表之一，他于二月中旬，当荷海外殖民部长沙逊在美国压力之下辞职后，由巴达维亚匆匆返荷。据法新社二月十六日披露，比尔“不完全同意”荷政府向美国对印尼的政策让步。与比尔返荷同时，荷兰议会对印尼问题举行激烈辩论之际，天主教党“强硬”派议员对荷内阁对美国的让步大加攻击。该党议员维尔脱称：“荷兰军队正在为了已经不是我们自己的事业而战”（塔斯社）。
    据法新社二十六日引海牙的所谓消息灵通人士的见解称：荷政府的新决定，乃图使美国控制的安理会表示满意，同时将未来“谈判”的发起权与控制权操在荷兰手里。但据合众社巴达维亚二十六日电披露，美国控制的印尼委员会对荷兰的新计划表示不满，该委员会的发言人称：“印尼委员会将于三月一日把整个问题交回安理会处理”。在美方表示了态度之后，被拘禁于邦加岛的苏加诺与哈达，亦于二十八日表示拒绝荷兰邀请。
