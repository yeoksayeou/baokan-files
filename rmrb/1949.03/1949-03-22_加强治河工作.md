　　Strengthening River Management Work

    The North China Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, in its instructions on launching agricultural production, pointed out that launching a large-scale production movement is the overriding central task for the future. We must do a good job in production from all aspects, and river management is a very important part of this.

    In the past for a considerable period, due to the enemy and puppet regime's division and blockade, control of rivers, and destruction of embankments, using water as a weapon, our river management work suffered severe restrictions and difficulties. However, under the correct leadership of our Party and the People's Government, relying on the broad masses, and overcoming various difficulties, we have achieved great success, especially in rescuing and repairing the Yellow River. This prevented the Yellow River, which had been a scourge for thousands of years, from causing a major disaster under the malicious sabotage of the bandits, and the lives and property of millions of people were preserved. Now North China has been basically completely liberated, which gives us more favorable conditions for river management work than in the past ten years. But on the other hand, because the war environment still exists nationwide, vigorously supporting the national liberation war is still a major task at present. Therefore, today it is still impossible to devote more manpower and material resources to river management projects. The North China Water Conservancy Committee's policy of selecting dangerous areas for repair and strengthening defense during the flood season is completely correct.

    It must be pointed out that some areas have neglected the war environment and the specific conditions of their regions, made huge plans, hoping to accomplish everything at once, or emphasized local interests while ignoring overall interests. These are all unrealistic and inappropriate. The plan formulated by the North China Water Conservancy Committee includes the embankment restoration and risk repair projects of major rivers in North China. As long as it is earnestly completed according to the plan, the dilapidated situation of the past will be greatly improved. In addition, with the efforts of flood season defense, the fruits of large-scale production can be protected from damage.

    Now that the spring thaw has passed and spring plowing is about to begin in various places, Party and river management organs at all levels must, under unified leadership, scientifically organize time and manpower, and list it as a shock work when necessary, so as to ensure that agricultural work is not delayed and water conservancy plans can be completed on schedule. Secondly, improvements are also required in terms of engineering quality and work efficiency. Necessary reward and punishment methods should be stipulated, challenges and competitions should be launched, and inspection and acceptance systems should be established to ensure the reliability of the project. Attention should be paid to the storage and safekeeping of engineering materials, advocating frugality and opposing waste. In particular, we must rely on the masses and give play to the creativity of the masses, so as to make more efforts than in any previous year and achieve more achievements than in any previous year!

### 加强治河工作

　　加强治河工作
    中共中央华北局在关于开展农业生产的指示里，指出开展大生产运动是今后压倒一切的中心工作。我们必须从各方面把生产搞好，治河工作就是很重要的一环。
    过去相当长的时期，由于敌伪的分割封锁，控制河流，破坏堤防，以水代兵，使我们的治河工作遭受到严重的限制和困难，但在我党和人民政府的正确领导下，依靠广大群众，克服各种困难，曾获得了很大的成绩，特别是抢修黄河，使数千年来为患的黄水，在匪帮恶毒破坏下，未致酿成巨灾，千百万人民生命财产获得保全。现在华北基本上已全部解放，这给我们治河工作增加了十余年来所未有的有利条件；但另一方面，由于全国范围内还是战争环境，大力支援全国解放战争还是当前重大的任务，因此今天还不可能拿出更大的人力物力进行治河工程。华北水利委员会提出择险修整，汛期加强防守的方针，是完全正确的。
    必须指出有些地区忽视了战争环境和本地区的具体条件，做出庞大计划，希图百废俱举，一蹴而成，或强调局部利益而忽略全局利益，这都是不合实际、不妥当的。华北水利委员会所订的计划，包括了华北各主要河流的复堤修险工程，只要按计划切实完成，过去残破的局面就会有很大的改善，再加上汛期的努力防守，就可以保护大生产成果不被损害。
    现在春融已过，各地即将开始春耕，这就须要各级党政治河机关在统一领导下，科学地组织时间、人力，必要时列为突击工作，作到既不耽误农时，又能按期完成水利计划。其次，在工程质量上、工作效率上，也要求提高一步，规定必要的奖惩办法，发动挑战竞赛，建立检查验收制度，以保证工程的可靠性；工程器材注意保管收藏，提倡节约，反对浪费。尤其要依靠群众，发挥群众的创造性，以超过以往任何一年的努力来作出超过以往任何一年的成绩！
