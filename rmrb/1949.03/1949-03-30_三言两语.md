　　Three Words and Two Phrases
            The Direction of Competition
    The revolutionary competition in state-owned factories is one of the signs of new labor. Competition has stimulated the enthusiasm of employees for collective labor and awakened the sense of responsibility of the working class as masters of their own affairs. Raising standards for output and quality, should be greatly promoted in various places in the future as long as conditions are ripe. However, to launch competition, it is first necessary to raise workers' awareness and care about workers' lives, instead of blindly pursuing processing, even to the point of making workers too busy to sleep or eat, thereby harming their health. In the competition, Jiaozuo, Shijiazhuang and other places have promoted the creative spirit of workers, allowing them to sum up their own experiences, inspire their wisdom, find ways to transform production tools, improve the production process, improve efficiency, and save time and raw materials. This is a correct direction. Simply emphasizing "shock work," even if it increases output, will reduce quality, and production improvements will not be consolidated.
    　　　　
    Specifically Care for the Daily Life of Employees
    To seek workers' welfare, we must truly care about the daily life of employees. The Shijiazhuang Railway Bureau's solution to the difficulties of single men's food and lodging is a good example. Don't think that providing an auditorium, establishing a club, organizing a troupe, and a singing team completely solves the problem of workers' welfare. No, we still have a lot of work to do. We must care about the daily life of all kinds of employees, solve all kinds of specific difficulties that can be solved, and improve their living conditions as much as possible.
    　　　　
    Zhangjiakou Strengthens Political Education for Employees
    It is very important for employees of state-owned factories in Zhangjiakou to work hard to study politics. Only through political education can the working class understand the laws of social development, the creation of the world through labor, the basic principles of class and nation, the basic problems of the Chinese revolution, and the party's policies, etc., in order to raise their awareness and place themselves in the position of social and political leaders. Since the Party wants to unite the entire working class, the entire peasant class, and the broad revolutionary intellectuals as the leading force and leading foundation of the people's democratic dictatorship, it must give them the necessary political education and arm them with Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought.

　　三言两语
            竞赛的方向
    公营工厂的革命竞赛，是新劳动标志之一，竞赛激励了职工集体劳动的热忱，唤起工人阶级主人翁的自觉。提高标准产量和质量，今后只要条件成熟，各地都应大大推广，但要发动竞赛首先必须提高工人觉悟，关心工人生活而不应盲目追求加工，甚至让工人忙的不睡觉不吃饭，以致损害工人健康。焦作、石家庄等地在竞赛中发扬工人创造精神，让工人自己总结经验，启发他们的智慧，想办法改造生产工具，改进生产过程，提高效率、节省时间原料，这是一个正确的方向。单纯强调“突击”，即使增加了产量，质量也会降低，生产提高无法巩固。
    　　　　具体关心职工日常生活
    谋工人福利，必须真正关心职工的日常生活，石市铁路局解决单身汉食宿困难便是一个好的例子、切不要以为备了礼堂、成立了俱乐部，组织了剧团、歌咏队，工人福利便算完全解决了，不是的，我们还有很多工作要做，一定要关心各种职工的日常生活，解决各种可能解决的具体困难，尽可能地改善他们的生活条件。
    　　　　张家口加强职工政治教育
    张家口公营工厂职工努力学习政治，非常重要，工人阶级只有经过政治教育，懂得了社会发展规律、劳动创造世界、阶级和国家、中国革命基本问题以及党的政策等等基本道理才能提高觉悟，使自己处于社会上和政治上领导者的地位。既然党要团结全体工人阶级，全体农民阶级，和广大革命知识分子作为人民民主专政的领导力量和领导基础，那就必须给予他们以必要的政治教育和以马列主义毛泽东思想武装他们。
