Xinhua News Agency, Central China, 13th:  Water and land transportation and postal and telecommunications links have gradually been restored in the newly liberated cities along the river, such as Nantong, Yangzhou, and Taizhou. When the Kuomintang troops fled to the south of the Yangtze River, they sabotaged various transportation facilities. The Wanfu Bridge on the Yang (zhou) Jing (jiang) highway, which was one mile long, was blown up for twenty zhang [approximately 67 meters], and three other bridges, each half a mile long, were also destroyed, causing the interruption of highway traffic between Yangzhou and Huaiyin. The Da Rong Bridge and Tong Yang Bridge on the canal were also burned down. All important documents and archives of the Nantong Post Office were taken away, and ten important electric wires and sixty other electric wires of the private Dasheng Telephone Company were also destroyed. After the liberation of these cities, the democratic government actively led the restoration work. The Nantong Dasheng Power Plant continued to generate electricity on the night of the liberation. Four linemen from the plant braved the danger of shelling from enemy ships to repair a 22,000-volt high-voltage line in Tianshenggang, enabling the factories in the Tangjia闸 industrial area to resume work as scheduled. Workers from the Dasheng Telephone Company also quickly repaired the wires and restored telephone service throughout the city. Employees of the Yangzhou Telecommunications Bureau connected all the telephones in the city within two hours after the Kuomintang bandit troops withdrew. Thanks to the democratic government's organization of farmers to repair the highways, the cars of various private automobile companies have been running between the cities. Currently, Nantong has more than ninety cars traveling to and from various places, directly reaching Huaiyin and Xuzhou. The private Hezhong Automobile Company in Yangzhou has also repaired more than sixty cars to travel to various places in northern Jiangsu. The democratic government also loaned four million Central China currency to help the Taizhou private Taiyang Automobile Company, which suffered heavy losses from the bombing, to resume operations. In terms of water transportation, dozens of steamers and more than a hundred fast boats have been traveling between the cities along the river. The work of the post offices in each city has been restored extremely quickly, and the postal routes with the liberated areas have been smoothly opened.

　　民主政府积极领导恢复工作
  　苏中新区水陆畅通
    【新华社华中十三日电】新解放区的南通、扬州、泰州等沿江城市，水陆交通和邮电联络已逐渐恢复。这些地区的国民党军队逃往江南时，曾对各项交通建设进行破坏。扬（州）靖（江）公路上长达一里的万福桥即被炸毁二十丈，另有各长半里的桥梁三座亦被毁，致扬州与淮阴间公路交通断绝。运河上的大荣桥、通扬桥也被烧毁。南通邮局的重要文件档案全被带走，私营大聪电话公司的重要电线十根及其他电线六十根亦被破坏。这些城市解放后，民主政府便积极领导恢复工作。南通大生电厂在解放当晚便照常发电，该厂外线工人四人冒着敌舰炮击的危险，在天生港修理一根二万二千伏的高压线，使唐家闸工业区各工厂能如期复工。大聪电话公司工人也迅速修好电线，恢复全城通话。扬州电信局员工，在国民党匪军撤走后两小时就将全市电话接通。由于民主政府组织农民将公路修好，各私营汽车公司的汽车已行驶于各城之间。刻南通已有九十余辆汽车往来各地，可直达淮阴徐州。扬州私营合众汽车公司也已修好汽车六十余辆行驶淮南各地。民主政府还贷出华中币四百万元帮助被炸损失甚重的泰州私营泰扬汽车公司复业。水路交通方面，数十只轮船汽船与百余只快船已在沿江各城市间来往。各城邮局工作恢复极快，与各解放区邮路业已畅通。
