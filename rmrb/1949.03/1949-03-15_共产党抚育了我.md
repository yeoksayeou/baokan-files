　　The Communist Party Nurtured Me
　　Hua Zhen
　　In the old society, the school gates were open, but children without money couldn't enter. A family like mine, the money my father earned and my mother's income from washing, embroidering, and sewing clothes, couldn't support our eight siblings. My older brother was sent to work as an apprentice in a cloth shop at the age of fourteen. I was only eleven and a half when I became an apprentice in a printing factory, having barely managed to study for two and a half years in primary school. Moreover, if it hadn't been for a slight family connection, that printing factory wouldn't have taken me in either.

　　When I started working in the printing factory, I was in the day shift typesetting room. Soon after, I was transferred to the night shift typesetting room (that is, newspaper layout). Here, I couldn't sleep all night, and during the day I had to take care of all the miscellaneous tasks for the entire room and disassemble the layouts. This work was originally done by adults, but it was shouldered by me, an eleven-year-old child. At that time, when I was disassembling the newspaper layouts, I couldn't even reach the workbench, and I often had to put two bricks under my feet. When the technicians rested during work breaks, they would wake me up from my drowsiness and talk to me to avoid the foreman seeing me dozing off and beating me. They often said to me in a sympathetic tone: "You are so pitiful. Children from wealthy families are still sleeping in their mothers' arms at your age, but you are standing here. It's good enough if you don't doze off, but if you do, you'll get slapped!" At that time, although I didn't understand much, these words often pricked my heart like needles, and I shed bitter tears, washing the ink-stained cheeks into patches of white and black grime.

　　A young child away from home, a mother's heart cannot be at peace. In the third month after I left home, my mother came to see me. I think she must have been very happy at the time. Who knew that when my black face, disheveled hair, and a pair of chicken claw hands appeared before her, she didn't say a word and left. Later, I heard others say that my mother cried for several days after she returned, and my father also shed old tears. But their tears were shed in vain. Besides letting me continue to stay in that factory, what else could be done? Only the owner of the factory had that power. When my father died and I asked for leave to go home, he sent me a letter telling me not to go back to work there anymore.

　　With my father's death, the family became even more difficult. I couldn't stay at home, so I entered a second printing factory to continue my life that was worse than that of a beast of burden. However, the experience of the first unemployment made me pay more attention to not being fired again in my work. I gritted my teeth and endured any hardship. Originally, my work was already very heavy, but the factory owner just happened to lay off two or three apprentices and added their work to me as well. I remember very clearly that this caused me to not sleep in a bed for seven days. Once, when I was so sleepy that I couldn't stand it, I secretly went to a dark and damp corner and curled up there like a stray dog ​​to sleep for a while. It happened that the work director came back and woke me up with a series of fists and slaps. I don't know how many grievances I had in my heart! But, I was afraid of being fired, I dared not resist him, and I couldn't even cry out. I just looked at him with tearful eyes!

　　More than a year later, I completed my apprenticeship, followed by unemployment and starvation... It was not new to me to spend a day with a sesame cake and a bowl of boiled water. But after all, I had worked in an industry for four or five years, and the fate of many typesetting workers was similar to mine. Because of hunger, cold, hardship, and illness, I often saw or heard that this colleague died in the toilet, that colleague died in a cheap inn... I saw the tragic end of my colleagues, but I and many, many other workers still had to continue living!

　　In 1942, because of the death of my mother and brother, I couldn't find employment in Chengdu no matter what, forcing me to leave my hometown and go to Chongqing to seek a way out! Here, I entered the New China Daily, I found her - the Communist Party, and I threw myself into her embrace!

　　October 12th is the most unforgettable day for me. The comrades' warm hospitality and comfort made me immerse myself in the sea of ​​humanity's great love for the first time in my life. What moved me the most was the care the director of the printing department took of me. Even when I was already asleep, he would come and tuck me in... Lying in bed, I compared that time when I hadn't taken off my clothes to sleep for seven days due to heavy work, and secretly rejoiced and thanked myself.

　　The next day, a comrade from the academic affairs office called me in. He firmly held my hand and asked kindly, "Comrade Hua Zhen, how old are you?" "How many years have you studied?" Then he introduced me to the work situation and study situation here. In my conversation with him, I discovered an unexpected miracle. I, a child who had been out of school for many years - here, not only found a job, but also had the opportunity to study.

　　More than four years have passed. In this place dedicated to serving the people - any place led by the Communist Party is the same - I have been nurtured and grown. In terms of technology, because there is no threat of unemployment, I can concentrate on improving my skills. With the guidance of my comrades, I have made great progress. Many things that I couldn't do before, I can do now. I used to be able to typeset only a thousand characters per hour, but later I improved to fourteen or fifteen hundred characters. I used to make ten or so mistakes per thousand characters, but later I reduced it to an average of only four or five mistakes every three months. In terms of cultural level, I can talk about theory and major events at home and abroad... and I can write rough drafts. When I see my monthly production statistics and the drafts published in the newspaper, I often recall the mood of the first night I joined the New China Daily: "Secretly rejoicing, secretly grateful," and encouraging me to move forward.

　　On February 28, 1947, the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang was conducting a large-scale civil war, forcing the Chongqing New China Daily to cease publication with 5,000 military police, secret agents, and special agents. Therefore, I followed everyone back to the liberated area. Here, I entered North China University. During my studies at North China University, I became a member of the Chinese Communist Party!

　　共产党抚育了我
    华真
    在旧社会里学校门是敞开的，但是，没有钱的孩子却进不去。象我的那个家庭，父亲赚来的钱和母亲洗衣、绣花、缝衣服的收入，怎么也不能养活我们姊妹八个，哥哥十四岁上便送进一家布店里去当学徒。我当一个印刷厂里的学徒时，才十一岁半，只是勉勉强强的在初级小学里念了两年半的书。而且那家印刷厂要不是沾点亲戚关系，人家也是不会收容下去的。
    在印刷厂里工作开始我是在日班排字房，不久就调在晚班排字房（也就是报版），在这里夜里澈夜不能睡觉，白天还要负担整个房的杂事和拆版子的工作。这工作本是成年人作的，却由我十一岁的孩子担负。那时候，我拆报版时，还够不着案板，脚下经常要垫两个砖；当技工们在工作空隙中休息时，把我从瞌睡中叫醒，跟我说这说那，避免工头来看见我打盹时又要打我。他们经常用同情的口吻对我说：“你太可怜了，有钱人家的孩子，象你这么大还在娘怀里睡觉哩，你却在这里站着，不打瞌睡还好，一打瞌睡你还得挨耳光！”那时，我虽懂事不多，可是这些话常象针刺在我的心里，流出辛酸的泪水来，把我被油墨涂黑的脸颊上，洗成白一块黑一块的垢渍。
    小小孩子离家在外，母亲的心是不能安然的，在我离家的第三个月上，母亲来看我了，我想当时她应该是很高兴的。谁知，当我一副乌黑的脸，蓬松的头发和一双鸡公爪手出现在她的面前时，她没有说一句话就走了。后来我才听别人说，母亲那次回去整哭了几天，父亲也流了老泪。但是他们的泪是白流了，除了让我在那个工厂里继续再待下去以外，还有什么办法呢？只有工厂的主人有这个权力。当我死了父亲请假回家的时候，给我来了一封信，叫我不要再去他们那里工作了。
    父亲一死，家里更困难，我没法在家待下去，又进了第二家印刷厂继续我那牛马不如的生活。但是，第一次失业的经验，使我在工作中更注意到不要再给人家开除，我咬着牙忍受着任何艰苦。本来我的工作就很繁重了，但厂主偏偏又裁了两三个学徒，并把他们的工作也加在我身上。我还记得很清楚，曾因此使我七天没有上过床睡觉，有一次困得不行了，偷偷地到阴暗而潮湿的角落里象野狗似的蜷在那里睡一会儿，恰巧工务主任回来了，一阵拳头巴掌把我打醒，我心里就不知道有多少委屈啊！但，我怕开除，我不敢反抗他，我也哭不出声，我只用含满泪水的眼睛看着他！
    一年多之后我就满了师，随着而来的失业和饿肚子………一个烧饼、一碗开水过一天，在我的经历中就不是新鲜的事情了。但总算是我在一个行业中混过了四五年，许多排字工友们的命运也是和我差不多的，因为饥寒、困苦和疾病的原故，我经常看到或者听说，这个同事死在厕所里了，那个同事又死在鸡毛店里………我看到工友们的悲惨的下场，但是我和其他很多很多的工友们，还得要继续生活下去！
    一九四二年，因为母亲和哥哥的死，在成都我无论如何不能就业，迫使我不能不离开我的故乡而到重庆去找寻我的生路！在这里，我进了新华日报，我找到了她——共产党，我就投入了她的怀抱！
    十月十二号，是我最难忘的一天。同志们对我那样的热忱招待和慰问，使我有生以来第一次沈浸在人类伟大的爱的海里。最使我感动的是印刷部主任对我的照顾，甚至，在我已睡觉的时候，还来给我盖好被子……。睡在床上，我曾把那次因工作繁重到七天没有脱衣睡觉的情景对照起来，心里暗自庆幸，暗自在感谢。
    第二天，教务处的一个同志把我叫去了，他紧紧的捏着我的手，亲切地问着：“华真同志，你多大？”：“你读了几年书？”接着就给我介绍这里的工作情形和学习情形。和他的谈话中，使我发现了一个意想不到的奇迹，我一个失学多年的孩子——在这里，不仅是找到了工作，而且还有了学习的机会。
    四年多的光景过去了，在这以为人民服务为己任的地方——共产党领导的任何的地方都是一样，我被抚养成长着。在技术上，由于没有失业的威胁，可以专心提高自己的业务，加上同志们的指导，我有很大的进步，从前好多不会作的事，现在会作了；以前我每小时只能排一千字，后来提高到一千四五百字；以前每千字中要错十来个字，后来减少到每三个月平均只错四、五字。在文化程度上，我能谈谈理论和国内外大事情……，并且会写粗糙的稿子。当我看到我每月的生产比例表和在报上发表了的稿子时，我心里往往是回味着参加新华日报工作的第一个晚上的心情：“暗自幸庆，暗自感谢”，并且鼓舞着我的前进。
    一九四七年二月二十八日，蒋介石匪帮正在进行着大规模内战，以五千军警宪特迫使重庆新华日报停了刊，因此，我就跟着大家回到了解放区，在这里我进了华北大学。在华北大学的学习期间，我又成了中国共产党的党员！
