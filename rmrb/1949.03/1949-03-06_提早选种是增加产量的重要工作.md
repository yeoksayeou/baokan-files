　　Early Seed Selection is an Important Task to Increase Production
　　The occurrence of various crop diseases in the Taihang Second District last year was quite serious, especially the head smut disease of millet, which was most prevalent. According to investigations in various parts of the Second District, millet diseases accounted for approximately 15% of the total average. According to the survey of Shixia Village in Zuoquan and Xiayu Village in Xiangyuan alone, 25% of the crops were diseased, and the most serious cases reached 35% to 40%, causing incalculable losses to the masses. In order to reduce the occurrence of diseases and achieve the goal of increased production this year, the Second District instructed various counties to make full preparations for this as soon as possible, and suggested that all localities mobilize and organize the masses to select and replace improved varieties before sowing, so as to create a mass and conscious seed replacement movement. At the same time, the results of our investigation and research in Xiayu Village, Xiangyuan County, can powerfully illustrate that seed replacement is the main way to reduce diseases and increase production. There is a kind of millet in the village called "White Hen's Beak". This millet has been planted in the village for fifteen or sixteen years. At that time, the seeds were exchanged from Gangli Village, five miles away from the village. The yield was very large, with an average of one stone and eight dou (city stone) per mu, which became an excellent variety in the village. Therefore, the masses had a saying: "If you want to eat rice, White Hen's Beak; sharp dou of millet, level dou of rice". Since then, the masses have planted it in large quantities, and now the planting area of White Hen's Beak accounts for about 70%. This kind of millet began to suffer from diseases five years ago, and it was most serious last year. For example, Li Yancheng in the village planted White Hen's Beak seven or eight years ago, with an average yield of one stone and five dou per mu. Now, in the same plot of land, one-third of the crops suffered from head smut disease last year, with an average yield of only eight dou per mu, a difference of seven dou. Another example is Lin Goudan, who planted eight mu of White Hen's Beak last year. Because this plot of land used to be wheat field, it was the first time to plant millet last year. There were fewer diseases and the yield was large. The normal grain yield of this land is one stone and one dou, and the actual yield per mu is one stone and four dou, exceeding the normal yield by three dou. Another kind of millet called Golden Club has only been planted in the village for two years. Last year, it was only developed to more than ten mu. It did not suffer from diseases and the yield was also very large. For example, Guo Guiyun planted four mu of this millet, with a normal yield of one stone and one dou per mu, and an actual yield of one stone and five dou per mu, exceeding the normal yield by four dou. However, in some villages where this kind of millet has been planted for a long time, the diseases are also very serious. The above materials show that no matter how good a crop is, if you do not often prevent and control diseases, after a long time, there will be extremely serious diseases. The masses also have the same experience: seeds must be exchanged frequently in order to reduce diseases and increase yield. Therefore, leaders in various places must pay attention to this and regard it as a major part of increasing production. All localities should first understand the disease-stricken areas and disease-free areas, as well as the disease-free area, and how many seeds can be exchanged. At the same time, they can mobilize and organize the masses to restore the masses' old habits, tell the masses where the seeds are disease-free, and use the masses' private friendship to carry out exchanges between households, groups, and villages. Cooperatives in various villages can do this work well. This work is a very urgent work and should be carried out as soon as possible, so that this work can form a mass and universal movement.

### 提早选种是增加产量的重要工作

　　提早选种是增加产量的重要工作
    太行二专区去年各种作物病害的发生是相当严重的，尤以谷子的白发病最为普遍，从二专区各地调查谷子的病害要占总平均百分之十五左右。仅按左权的石匣村和襄垣的下峪村调查，要有百分之二十五发生了病害，最严重的即达百分之三十五到四十，群众受到了不可计算的损失。我们为减少病害发生，达到今年增产的目的，二专区指示各县及早对此做充分准备，并建议各地在下种前动员与组织群众选换优良品种，使这一工作造成群众性自觉的换种运动。同时我们从襄垣县下峪村一个村调查研究的结果，可以有力的说明换种是减少病害增加产量的主要办法。该村有一种谷叫“白母鸡嘴”，此谷子在该村种植已有十五六年之久，当时由距该村五里路的港里村换来的种籽，产量很大，每亩平均打一石八斗（市石），成为该村的优良品种，因此群众即有句话说：“想吃米，母鸡嘴，尖斗谷，平斗米”。从此群众即大批种植，直到现在白母鸡嘴的种植面积约占百分之七十左右。这种谷在前五年即开始发生病害，去年最为严重，如该村李炎成在七、八年前种的白母鸡嘴，每亩平均打一石五斗，现在同一块地去年即发生白发病的达三分之一，每亩平均只打八斗，相差七斗。又如蔺狗旦，去年种有八亩白母鸡嘴，因这块地过去是麦地，去年第一次种谷，病害少产量大，该地常年产粮一石一斗，每亩实打一石四斗，超过产量三斗。另有一种叫金棒锤，在该村种植才有两年之久，去年刚发展到十余亩，没生病害产量亦很大，如郭贵云种有此谷四亩，应产量每亩为一石一斗，每亩实产一石五斗，超出产量四斗。但有些村种这种谷子的因年代很长，发生病害也很严重。从以上材料可说明：一种作物不管它怎样优良，如果你不经常对病害加以防治，年代长了，即要有极严重的病害发生。群众也同样有这样经验：必须经常调换种籽，才能减少病害，产量亦才能增加。所以各地领导上必须对此重视起来，应视为是增加产量的主要部分。各地首先应把发生病的地区和无病地区，及无病的面积，可换多少种籽，具体了解；与此同时，可动员与组织群众，恢复群众旧有习惯，告诉群众那些地方种籽无病，利用群众的私人亲友关系，户与户、组与组、村与村实行调换，各村合作社可以把这件工作做好，这个工作是一件很迫切的工作，应及早进行，使这一工作形成群众性的普遍运动。
