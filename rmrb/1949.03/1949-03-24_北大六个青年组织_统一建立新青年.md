　　Peking University's Six Youth Organizations
    Unite to Establish New Youth
    [This Newspaper's Report] During the reactionary rule of the Chinese Democratic League, Peking University, in its struggle, produced six revolutionary youth organizations: "Democratic Youth League," "Democratic Youth Alliance," "Democratic Revolutionary Youth League," "Democratic Progressive Youth Alliance," "Agricultural Youth Alliance," and "Progressive Youth League Association." After liberation, youth obtained full freedom to engage in revolutionary work, and the restrictions of the past no longer exist; the political and organizational defects of the Democratic Youth League and other organizations are no longer suited to the current situation and the requirements of the members. After the CCP Central Committee's resolution on establishing the Youth League was announced, the Preparatory Committee of the New Democratic Youth League of China in Beiping City was also established. The six groups, including the Peking University Democratic Youth League, decided to respond to the call to establish the League and scheduled a general meeting of members at 7:00 p.m. today to actively carry out the work of establishing the League.

　　北大六个青年组织
    统一建立新青年
    【本报讯】中国民盟反动统治时期，北京大学在斗争中产生了“民主青年同盟”、“民主青年联盟”、“民主革命青年联盟”、“民主进步青年联盟”、“农业青年联盟”及“进步青年联盟会”等六个革命青年组织。解放后，青年获得了从事革命工作的充分自由，过去各种条件的限制已不复存在；而民青等组织在政治上组织上的缺陷也已不适合目前形势及盟员的要求。中共中央建团的决议公布后，中国新民主主义青年团北平市筹委会亦已成立，北大民青等六团体乃决定响应建团号召，定于今天下午七时召开盟员大会，积极展开建团工作。
