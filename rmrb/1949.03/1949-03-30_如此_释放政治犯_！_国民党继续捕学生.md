　　Such "Release of Political Prisoners"!
    The Kuomintang Continues to Arrest Students
    【Xinhua News Agency, Beiping, 27th】The reactionary Nanjing Kuomintang government continues to trample on human rights and arrest students. Most of the students arrested previously have not been released, and new arrests are underway. It is reported that the Nanjing student delegation petitioned the pseudo-Supervisory Yuan on the 23rd, demanding the immediate release of student political prisoners. The delegation's petition shows that the so-called order by pseudo-Acting President Li Zongren to release political prisoners is completely a deceptive empty check. The petition stated: Two more students from the Frontier College have recently "disappeared." Most of the students arrested previously have not been released, and some of the few students who were released have "disappeared" again, some have been summoned again, and some guarantors have been detained.

　　如此“释放政治犯”！
    国民党继续捕学生
    【新华社北平二十七日电】南京国民党反动政府继续摧残人权，逮捕学生。以前被捕的学生大多数没有释放，而新的逮捕又正在进行。据悉：南京学生代表团二十三日曾向伪监察院请愿，要求立即释放学生政治犯。代表团的请愿书显示出伪代总统李宗仁所谓释放政治犯的命令，完全是欺骗人的空头支票。请愿书称：边疆学院最近又有学生二人“失踪”，以前被捕的学生，大多数都没有释放，而少数被释放的学生，有的重新“失踪”，有的又被传讯，有的保人被押。
