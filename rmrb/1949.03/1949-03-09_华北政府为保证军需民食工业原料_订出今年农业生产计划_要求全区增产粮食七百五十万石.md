The North China Government Formulates Agricultural Production Plan for This Year to Ensure Military Supplies, Civilian Food, and Industrial Raw Materials

Requires the Entire Region to Increase Grain Production by 7.5 Million Shi

[Reported by this newspaper] In light of the new situation of complete liberation and the people's enthusiasm for production after the land reform, the North China People's Government has formulated the 1949 agricultural production plan for the North China Liberated Area (separate plans for the Eastern Hebei Region) to guarantee military supplies, civilian food, and industrial raw materials. This plan makes thorough arrangements to restore and develop production, raising it one step further from the existing foundation. The full text is excerpted below:

In 1949, the requirement is to increase grain production by five sheng (市升, calculated based on original harvests) per mu, totaling an increase of 7.5 million shi for the entire region (including the increase from converting dry land to paddy fields and eliminating wasteland). This is to ensure the supply of military needs and civilian food in the liberated areas and to prepare to supply sufficient food to major cities after liberation. It also aims to increase the production of industrial raw materials to ensure the operation of urban factories and to exchange for urban industrial products to meet the needs of farmers' lives and production. To this end, it is required to increase cotton production by 130 million jin (ginned cotton), which means expanding cotton fields by 60 percent, planting a total of over 12 million mu of cotton, and achieving an average yield of 35 jin of ginned cotton per mu, for a total production of 300 million jin.

Increase the production of oil crops. Universally promote the planting of peanuts in sandy soil areas, requiring the planting of 4 million mu this year to achieve a production of 900 million jin of peanuts. Plant a large amount of hemp on the edges of fields, embankments, ditches, and small plots of land. The entire region is required to produce 33 million jin of hemp seeds. The planting of other various oil crops should also be universally promoted. Efforts should be made to increase the production of hemp fiber on the existing basis.

In order to compensate for the reduction in grain quantity due to the land occupied by increased industrial raw material production, the planting of high-yielding crops such as sweet potatoes and potatoes should be promoted. Plant alfalfa, purple acacia, lespedeza, and other forage crops on small plots of sandy and alkaline land to develop animal husbandry.

Based on this plan, strive to reach pre-war levels within three years.

In order to achieve the above production increase requirements, the following effective measures must be taken:

Increase Cotton Production by 130 Million Jin; Produce 930 Million Jin of Oil Crops

First, effectively solve the difficulty of insufficient labor. Promote labor mutual aid and require more than 50 percent of women with full labor capacity to participate in the main labor of agricultural production. Ensure more plowing and hoeing. Old areas should plow more than twice, and harrowing should be restored to pre-war levels. New areas should not plant bare fields and should hoe at least two to three times. Reward the masses for breeding livestock in large numbers, absorbing livestock population, organizing breeding stations, cultivating veterinary talents, transforming old veterinarians, and establishing veterinary stations. In the Wutai Mountain area, the Heshun Mountain area, the Huo Mountain area, and the Huxi area of ​​the Hebei-Shandong-Henan region, special Forestry and Animal Husbandry Bureaus or Animal Husbandry Management Offices should be set up to be responsible for organizing the masses to breed 242,000 heads of livestock. Based on this, strive to restore the number of draft animals to pre-war levels within five years.

Second, vigorously prevent floods (plans have been formulated by the Water Conservancy Committee) and reduce droughts. Build water conservancy projects and convert 2 million mu of dry land into paddy fields.

Increase paddy fields by 1 million mu by opening canals. The Shijiazhuang-Jinan Canal should establish a specialized enterprise management organization. Other large irrigation projects must first be surveyed and engineering plans formulated.

Increase paddy fields by 1 million mu by utilizing wells and springs. Establish water conservancy promotion societies in Shijiazhuang, Anguo, Tangxian, Xingtai, and Handan to restore and develop water wells and waterwheels. Require the repair of one-half of old waterwheels (approximately 50,000 vehicles) and the development of 16,000 new waterwheels.

Third, increasing fertilizer is one of the decisive conditions for increasing production. Promote the masses' old habits of accumulating fertilizer and accumulate fertilizer in large quantities. Based on 1948, require: areas with a foundation to increase fertilizer by 20 percent, and areas with a poor foundation to increase fertilizer by 15 percent (each region should propose specific figures based on this requirement). Areas with a foundation in the plains should require one pig per household, areas with a poor foundation should require one pig per two households, and the worst areas must also achieve one pig per ten households, and require pigs to have sties. Promote the use of swine fever serum. Major farms should breed piglets. In addition to promoting green manure and smoked manure and raising pigs in mountainous areas, focus on developing sheep raising. Increase by one-third on the existing number (approximately 1.5 million heads in Taihang, Taiyue, and Beiyue), and resolve the sales of wool.

Fourth, in addition to preventing harm from diseases, insects, birds, and beasts and promoting improved varieties, ensure that locusts, armyworms, cutworms, aphids, pear and jujube leaf beetles, and the Colorado potato beetle in potato-producing areas, and rice stem borers in rice-producing areas do not become disasters. Use slack farming seasons to catch birds and beasts, encircle mountains for hunting, and purchase a portion of DDT and 500,000 jin of arsenic, promote local pesticides, promote local methods, and organize the use of sprayers.

Organize the masses to select and change seeds, and promote improved varieties. Focus specifically on promoting: 180,000 mu of improved wheat seeds, 130,000 mu of improved millet seeds, 49,000 mu of S-series cotton (2B, 4B), 2,400 mu of Victory Rice, and 2,400 mu of Victory Sweet Potatoes. Pay attention to breeding and collecting seeds to prepare for large-scale promotion in 1950.

The North China Farm will concurrently operate agricultural necessities such as seeds, pesticides, and fertilizers, and will contact local farms, production promotion societies, and county federations to facilitate promotion.

Increase Fertilizer and Add Agricultural Tools; Eliminate 600,000 Mu of Wasteland

Fifth, increase and repair agricultural tools. Require the production of 1 million hoe blades, 150,000 plowshares, 1 million shovels, 500,000 rakes, and 1.5 million sickles. Universally organize agricultural tool repair stations and blacksmith shops to repair old agricultural tools. Restore large carts in flat areas. In areas where it is difficult to travel with large carts, gradually utilize handcarts.

Establish an agricultural tool factory to research and improve agricultural tools and gradually manufacture new-style agricultural tools.

Sixth, expand the cultivated area and eliminate a total of 600,000 mu of new wasteland and land with better soil quality among old wasteland. Promote the construction of terraced fields in mountainous areas. In the vast, long-abandoned wasteland in southern Hebei and the Hebei-Shandong-Henan region, try using tractors for reclamation. The Ministry of Agriculture plans to establish a state-owned farm in Qianqingwa in southern Hebei to gain experience and cultivate tractor drivers and repair personnel.

Seventh, protect existing mountain forests, restore closed mountains, and organize the masses to plant more than 24 million trees (especially fruit trees) in major forest areas and throughout the region, strengthen technical guidance and organization management, and ensure a survival rate of over 70 percent.

In mountainous forest areas, require the cultivation of 2,700 mu of nurseries.

Eighth, rural sideline occupations are not only an important source of income for farmers but also very important for promoting agricultural production, supplying industrial raw materials and semi-finished products, and certain consumer goods and utensils for urban and rural areas. They should be promoted according to local conditions.

The textile industry is currently the main production of many women in various regions. In addition to meeting rural needs, it can also ensure military cloth and adjust supplies to neighboring regions. The quality should be improved and sales channels opened on the basis of existing production. The existing production level of 2.2 billion square feet of native cloth should be maintained.

The oil pressing industry is an important production for supplying edible oil, ensuring industrial needs, and increasing fertilizer, and it is also an important export item. Technology should be improved, tools should be improved, and large-scale development should be carried out. The required oil production is 340 million jin, and the oil cake production is 1.4 billion jin.

Sheepskins, wool, and bristles are necessary for export and industry. Sales channels must be opened and profits increased to stimulate the development of pigs and sheep and ensure increased agricultural production. The required production and sales are 1.5 million jin of wool, 2 million various skins, and 310,000 jin of bristles.

Mountain goods and medicinal materials are an important source of income for farmers, especially in mountainous areas. Production should be organized and processing promoted (such as jujube liquor and medicinal material manufacturing). Open up sales channels and protect the existing production base to seek gradual development.

Various local specialties, such as straw braided hats, reed mats, and bamboo products, should improve quality and open up sales channels according to existing conditions to restore production.

The transportation industry must strengthen organization and develop cart transportation to ensure smooth flow of goods.

Promote the development of small-scale agricultural and sideline combinations, and organize the labor and capital of the masses according to the principle of voluntary mutual benefit. Restore various workshops (such as oil mills, flour mills, cotton gins, leaching saltpeter, etc.) and gradually organize various specialized production cooperatives, such as oil production promotion societies, transportation tool promotion societies, and transportation cooperatives.

In order to solve the sales problem, supply and marketing cooperatives and state-owned trading enterprises are required to be responsible for organizing adjustment and export.
