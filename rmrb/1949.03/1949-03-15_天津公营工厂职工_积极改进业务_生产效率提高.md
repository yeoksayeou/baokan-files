　　Tianjin Public Factory Workers
  　Actively Improve Operations, Increasing Production Efficiency
    [Tianjin Electric] Workers in Tianjin's public factories are leveraging the wisdom of the working class to improve their operations. In terms of management, the Tianjin Rubber Factory No. 2 of the Pingjin Clothing General Factory has changed from working independently in the past to a collaborative approach, increasing work efficiency by more than double. When making rubber shoes, in the past, each person brushed glue and attached the sole, and had to wait for the glue to dry each time before attaching the sole. Now, there are dedicated people for brushing glue and attaching the sole, so no one has to wait anymore. In the hemp spinning workshop of China Textile Factory No. 4, when organizing the machines, they also reasonably divided the work, with dedicated personnel in charge of changing needles, installing needles, and cleaning machine parts. As a result, they repaired a coarse carding steel wire machine, which would have taken four weeks in the past, in five days. In the past, when workers at the electrical repair shop of the Railway Bureau received materials, the procedures were cumbersome, delaying time and often affecting work. After discussion at a meeting, a method of improvement was decided. Regarding the allocation of workers, the workers at the No. 2 Power Plant of the Jibei Electric Power Company saw that there was not much work in the second half of the night shift, but the number of workers was the same as the day shift, so they voluntarily requested a reduction. After adjustments, eight temporary workers are saved every day. The Central Machinery Factory also reassigned surplus employees from departments such as steel wire rope and hemp rope to departments such as rope pulling and strip washing, reducing manpower waste. In order to save the electricity and heat wasted by "furnace starting" and "furnace stopping", the Electric Equipment North Factory changed to a three-shift system to ensure that the furnace does not stop when people rest. In the process of improving operations, engineers and workers learn from each other's strengths to make up for their weaknesses, combining the theoretical knowledge of engineers with the practical experience of workers, so that production is improved. Engineer Luo of the Rubber Parts Factory accepted the opinions of the workers and revised the drawings. When formulating the production plan, engineers and worker foremen at the Central Machinery Factory No. 2 participated in the discussion together. After they fully exchanged their opinions, they unanimously agreed that the current monthly output of 700 vehicles could be increased to 800 vehicles.

　　天津公营工厂职工
  　积极改进业务  生产效率提高
    【天津电】天津市各公营工厂的职工们，发挥工人阶级的智慧，来改进自己的业务。在管理上，平津被服总厂天津橡胶二厂，把过去独自工作改为分工合作的办法，使工作效率提高了一倍以上。在制造胶鞋时，过去都是各自刷胶粘底，每次都要等胶干了才能上底。现在刷胶、粘底都有专人，谁也不用再等了。中纺四厂麻纺间，在整理机器时，也合理的分了工，管换针的、上针的、擦洗机件的，都用专人经管，因此在五天当中，修整了一部在过去要用四星期才能修好的粗梳钢丝机。铁道处电气修理厂过去工人领料时，手续繁琐，拖延时间，常常影响工作。经会议研究决定了改进办法。在工人的配置上，冀北电力公司第二发电厂的工人见到后半夜的一班工作不多，工人人数却与日班相同，便自动的请求减少。经调整以后，每日节省八个临时工。中央机器厂也把钢丝绳、麻绳等部门多余的职工分别安插到拔绳、洗条等部减少了人力浪费。电工器材北厂为了节省“合炉”、“停炉”所浪费的电热，改为三班工作制，做到歇人不歇炉。在改进业务当中，工程师与工人共同彼此取长补短，使工程师们的理论知识与工人实际经验相结合，使生产得到改进。橡胶配件厂罗工程师，接受工人意见，修正图样。中央机器二厂，在订定生产计划时，工程师与工人领班一同参加了讨论，当他们充分的交换了意见以后，一致认为可将目前月产量七百辆提高到八百辆。
