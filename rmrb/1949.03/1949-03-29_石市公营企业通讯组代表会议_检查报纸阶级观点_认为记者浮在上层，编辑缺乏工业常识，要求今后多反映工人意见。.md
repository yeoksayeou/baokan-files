　　Shijiazhuang Public Enterprise Correspondence Group Representative Meeting
  　Examining the Class Standpoint of the Newspaper
    Believes reporters are floating at the top, editors lack industrial common sense, and requests more reflection of workers' opinions in the future.
    [Shijiazhuang News] The Shijiazhuang Daily recently held a representative meeting of the Public Enterprise Correspondence Group to examine the newspaper's connection with the masses. The thirty representatives from the eighteen participating public enterprise correspondence groups frankly criticized the newspaper staff. They said: The newspaper has published many reports on enterprises, which have greatly encouraged the production enthusiasm of employees; however, many reports lack vivid content. The report on Ji Gensheng, an old worker from the "February 7th" strike, was considered bland by the railway machinery factory workers who worked with him because it did not write about his vivid details in daily production. Reporters only ask the leaders of enterprises or talk to the person himself, and it is not easy to know many vivid facts; only by delving into the production process, personally experiencing it among the workers, or mobilizing workers and staff to write, can the vivid content be reflected. The second shortcoming is the lack of self-criticism, "reporting only good news and not bad." The newspaper rarely sees workers reflecting on difficulties and their opinions, reporters rarely write critical reports, and correspondents are unwilling to expose the shortcomings of the leadership in their own units, fearing that it will incur dissatisfaction from the leadership. The third shortcoming is the lack of industrial production common sense and a lack of understanding of production conditions. Li Yufeng's article on repairing the locomotive that "couldn't be started for eleven years" was published as a front-page news item. In fact, this locomotive had been driven during the Japanese occupation era, the Kuomintang era, and even after liberation. The "handle" being difficult to operate was indeed a fact. Li Yufeng repaired it with high labor enthusiasm, and he certainly deserved praise, but the article regarded the usability of a locomotive solely as a relationship with "a spring on the handle," which was ridiculous. On another occasion, "the return of flour work was affected" in a flour mill was changed to "flour production was affected." This all shows that both the interviewing and editing staff lack industrial common sense. The fourth shortcoming is the lack of a wholehearted spirit of cultivating correspondents and serving them. Many manuscripts sent to the newspaper simply disappear like a clay ox entering the sea, never to be published or returned. Some reporters go to factories without specifically organizing correspondents to write articles, without contacting correspondents, and just write one article themselves. Sometimes there are conflicts between correspondents and reporters in writing articles. In the past, the newspaper published more articles by reporters and fewer articles by correspondents, and even fewer articles by worker correspondents. Dong Liangen, a worker from the inspection section, said: "Many workers in our area want to write articles, but no one tells us how to write, or even how to send them." Summarizing the above shortcomings, everyone believes that there is only one root cause: the newspaper staff lacks a class standpoint. In addition, the correspondents themselves also reviewed that writing articles irregularly and having little initiative in contacting the newspaper were the responsibilities of the correspondents themselves.
    Regarding future correspondence work, everyone put forward suggestions for improvement: First, party branches, administrations, and trade unions should attach importance to reporting work and regularly mobilize employees. Don't just designate some people as correspondents and be done with it. In the future, leaders should encourage everyone to write; moreover, writing articles can be used as one of the conditions for assessing academic performance. Secondly, vigorously organize and cultivate worker correspondents. At the beginning, worker correspondents should not be required to write complete news or communications, but should publish more of their voices, opinions, criticisms, suggestions, problem discussions, feelings, etc., related to production and the workers' vital interests. Third, the newspaper must ensure that manuscripts are returned if they are not published, tell the correspondents why they cannot be used, and provide them with regular guidance. When reporters go to factories, they should contact correspondents more often, specifically organize and help correspondents to write, and regard this as their own responsibility. Fourth, implement appropriate rewards for correspondents.

　　石市公营企业通讯组代表会议
  　检查报纸阶级观点
    认为记者浮在上层，编辑缺乏工业常识，要求今后多反映工人意见。
    【石家庄讯】石家庄日报近召开公营企业通讯组代表会议，检讨报纸联系群众问题。与会的十八个公营企业通讯组的三十个代表直率地批评了报纸工作人员。他们说：报纸曾经发表过许多企业报导，曾大大鼓励职工的生产热情；但有许多报导缺乏生动内容。“二七”老工人计根生的报导，和他在一起生产的铁路机厂工人看了，觉得平淡无味，因为他平日在生产中的生动情节并没有写出来。记者只问一问企业的领导人，或和本人谈一谈，很不容易知道许多生动的事实；只有深入到生产过程里，在工人群众中亲自体察，或是发动工人职员来写，才能够反映生动的内容。第二个缺点是缺乏自我批评，“报喜不报忧”。报上很少看到工人反映有那些困难和他们提出的意见，记者很少写批评报导，通讯员也不愿意揭露本单位领导上的缺点，怕招致领导上对自己不满。第三个缺点是缺乏工业生产常识，不了解生产情况。李裕丰修理“十一年开不动”的机车一稿，报上以头条新闻登出，事实上这个机车在日寇统治时代驶过，国民党时代也驶过，解放以后也曾经驶过，“手把”费劲确是事实。李丰裕以高度的劳动热情把它修理好，他的确值得表扬，但是稿里把一个机车的能用与否仅看成“手把上一个弹簧”的关系，未免可笑。另一次把面粉厂“回粉工作受影响”，改为“面粉生产受影响”。这都说明采访编辑人员都缺乏工业常识。第四个缺点是缺乏全心全意培养通讯员、为通讯员服务的精神。许多稿件寄到报社就简直象泥牛入海不见发表，也不见退稿。有的记者到厂里不去具体组织通讯员写稿，不和通讯员联系，自己写上一篇就算。有时通讯员与记者写稿发生矛盾，过去报上是记者的稿件多，通讯员稿件少，工人通讯员的稿件更少，检车段工人董连根说：“我们那里许多工人想写稿，但没人告诉我们怎样写，甚至连怎样寄也摸不清。”总结以上缺点，大家认为根源只有一个：报社工作人员缺乏阶级观点。另外，通讯员自己也检讨出写稿不经常、主动的和报社联系少是通讯员本身的责任。
    关于今后的通讯工作，大家提出改进意见：第一，党的支部、行政、工会应该重视报导工作要经常在职工中进行动员。不要光是指定一些人当通讯员就完事，今后，领导上应鼓励大家写；并且，可以把写稿当作考察学习成绩的条件之一。其次，是大力的组织培养工人通讯员，对工人通讯员，开始时不能要求他们写完整的新闻或通讯，应该多发表他们写的有关生产和工人切身利益的呼声、意见、批评建议、问题讨论、感想等等。第三，今后报社一定要做到稿件不登即退，告诉通讯员为什么不能用，并且给以经常的指导，记者到工厂，要多和通讯员联系。具体的组织和帮助通讯员写，把这一点应看成自己的责任。第四，对通讯员要实行适当奖励。
