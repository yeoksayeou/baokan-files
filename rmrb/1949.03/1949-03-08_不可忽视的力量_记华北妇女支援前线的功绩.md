　　An Unignorable Force
    ——Remembering the Contributions of North China Women in Supporting the Front Lines
    Compiled by: Mao Shulan, Newspaper Archives
    Women, who make up half the population of North China, have made indelible contributions to the North China Liberation War. Although they did not fight the enemy with bayonets or shed blood, their contributions were necessary and indispensable to the war. What is presented below is only a fragment of a silhouette, but from these silhouettes, we can also be enlightened: In supporting the front lines, women are an unignorable force.

    Thousand-layer soles, stitched with meticulous care. Sturdy and durable, to please the soldiers.
    When it comes to sewing military shoes and clothing, every woman, young and old, contributes. The soldiers wear them on their feet, hang them on their bodies... none of it is possible without the women's needlework. More than four hundred women in Huangdong Village, Qi County, have completed their annual military shoe assignments early and without fail since 1942. They say, "The army is fighting to the death in the front, isn't it all for us? What's it to make a few pairs of military shoes?" This spring, when making victory shoes, both the speed and quality exceeded any previous time. Two hundred and thirty-one of them made 170 pairs of military shoes in seven days. The soles were all thousand-layered, even sturdier and more meticulously made than the shoes they made for their own families. They processed them according to the soldiers' preferences – sturdy and beautiful. This year, women from nine villages in two districts of Meng County made 220 pairs of military shoes, 281 pieces of clothing, 354 hats, and 105 rice bags in one week, and also washed 288 pieces of clothing. Women in Anping Chengguan, Jizhong, heard that they were making military clothes for the soldiers in the front, and went to fetch them on their own without waiting for the village to assign them. Three hundred people in Wodi Village, Raoyang County, made more than 18,000 military clothes in seven days and 500 pairs of military socks in ten days. When military socks were distributed, the women scrambled to make them. Zheng Da Niang, who was over sixty years old, couldn't see well, but she said, "I have to do the same as others, even if I have to exchange labor with others." Many women disliked the public cloth and took out their own good cloth to replace it. Zhao Yu, a woman from Huangpu Village in Qingcangjiao (newly established county), was assigned a pair of socks by the village cadre, and she made nine pairs in ten days. She thought that the soldiers in the front were shedding blood and fighting the enemy to the death, and felt that she could only feel at ease if she put in more effort.

    Pounding rice and grinding flour, busy day and night, wholeheartedly for the front.
    "Pounding rice and grinding flour, for the sake of the front," has already become the historical consciousness and historical habit of women in the liberated areas. In any year and in any village, the public grain is rarely not pounded by women overnight, and some even personally participate in the transportation. This time, to support the Pingjin campaign, most of the women in Jizhong tirelessly pounded rice and ground flour day and night to ensure supply. Most of the men in Li'enhe Village, Dacheng, had gone to the Pingjin front, so the women and a few men divided into shifts to pound rice day and night. The women of twenty-seven households pounded 820 catties of grain in two days and two nights. Women from Jiankou Huaizhen and other villages pushed the mill themselves, freeing up livestock to transport grain. Shao Da Niang, a woman who turned over in Nanbei Village, heard that she was going to grind flour for the front, and quickly ground the four dou of wheat she had prepared for the New Year, and said, "Don't say that the superiors will return it, even if they don't, it will be a pleasure for the soldiers in the front to eat it." Thirty women in Koutou Village, Fourth District of Lingqiu, had transported 700 catties of grain to a place thirty miles away during the Ping-Sui campaign last year. The women in Xiaguan, First District of Lingqiu, carried a box of bullets each and carried them for eight miles, quickly supporting the needs of the front-line war. Last spring, when the enemy attacked Mancheng, the situation was very urgent. When the enemy situation was urgent in Dongloushan Village, Yixian County, the men went to war, and the women were afraid that the public grain would be lost, so they transported more than 6,000 catties of public grain to Jie'an twice overnight. During the large grain transport in December, a large number of children and women, regardless of hunger and cold, drove small donkeys to deliver public grain to Zhuozhou....

    Women in villages near the front line brave the rain to carry stretchers and transfer the wounded.
    In many places close to the front lines, due to the huge manpower required, women often directly participated in the war. In September 1948, the Second District of Yutian, Jidong, organized fifty-four women's stretchers to transfer the wounded in the rain. Women also took on many jobs such as sentry duty and delivering letters along the way. In Shunjiao and Digu Villages, Baodi, fifty-eight women automatically participated in destroying the enemy's transportation at one time. During the battle of Yanggezhuang in Leting, more than forty women from Bianliuhe, Liuzhuang and other villages automatically went to the front line to rush and transport the wounded and insisted on working on the front line to deliver water and food. During the two Pingbao campaigns, each village in Yixian organized a consolation group. Under the leadership of the director and deputy director Lian Yimei and Zhao Guizhi, all the women in Baibao Village received the wounded at the supply station and stayed up for three days and nights. Liu Yuhua (community member) of Shanbei Village led the women of thirteen villages to comfort the wounded, braving the pouring rain and wading through the flood to deliver things to the wounded....

    Women actively participate in these activities because they have realized that the army's fighting is entirely for the people, and also for themselves. Many women who have suffered under the oppression of landlords in the old society always constantly and unforgettably compare the two societies. Zhang Da Niang, a model military dependent in Pinggu County, said it well: "Thinking of the bitter days in the past, I will never forget today's benefactors for thousands of generations." Zhang Da Niang is just one of the women, and there are more than tens of millions who have the same ideological awareness as her. This is the source of combat power.

　　不可忽视的力量
    ——记华北妇女支援前线的功绩
    本报资料室  毛舒蓝 整理
    占有人口半数的华北妇女，在华北解放战争中有着不可磨灭的功绩；她们虽未与敌人拼刺刀，没有流血，但她们的贡献却是战争中必需的与不可缺少的一部份，下边所介绍的，只能说是一些片断的剪影，从这些剪影中，同样可以启示我们：支援前线中，妇女是一支不可忽视的力量。

    千层底，针针仔细缝。结实耐穿，要叫战士喜欢。
    提起缝军鞋做军衣来，闺女、媳妇、老的、少的，那一个妇女都有一份功劳。战士们脚上穿的，身上挂的……那一样也离不开妇女的针线。淇县黄洞村的四百余妇女，自一九四二年以来，年年的军鞋任务，都是不打折扣的早日完成。她们说：“军队在前方拼死拼活的，还不是为了咱们吗？做几双军鞋算个啥？”今春做胜利鞋时，无论速度上质量上，都超过以往任何一次，她们二百三十一人，七天就做成军鞋一百七十双，鞋底全是千层的，比给自己家中人穿的鞋还做得结实细致。她们是按照战士所喜受的——结实又漂亮的要求来加工的。今年孟县二个区九个村的妇女，一礼拜就做军鞋二百二十双，衣服二百八十一件，帽子三百五十四顶，米袋一百零五条，还洗了衣服二百八十八件。冀中安平城关妇女，听说给前方战士做军衣，没等村中分派就自动去取，饶阳县窝堤村三百人，七天做好军衣一万八千余件，十天做好军袜五百双。分配军袜时，妇女们都是抢着做，六十多岁的郑大娘，自己看不见做事，她说：“我和别人变工也要做一样”。好多妇女嫌公家的布不好，把自己的好布拿出来换上。青沧交（新设县）黄铺村干部分配妇女赵玉一双，她十天做成了九双。她想到前方战士流着血和敌人死拼，就觉得只有多拿出些力量才安心。
    碾米磨面昼夜忙，全心全意为前方。
    “碾米磨面，为的是前方。”这已经是解放区的妇女历史意识与历史习惯了。无论那一年无论那个村庄，公粮很少不是妇女连夜碾的，有的甚至亲自参加运送。此次支援平津作战，冀中大部的妇女，昼夜不闲地碾米碾面，保证了供给。大城李恩河村多数男子都到平津前线去了，妇女们就与少数男子，分班昼夜碾米，二十七户人家的妇女，两天两夜就碾了八百二十斤粮。建口淮镇等村，妇女自己推磨，腾下牲口运粮。南北村翻身妇女邵大娘听说要给前方磨面，很快的先磨了自己准备过年的四斗麦子，还说：“不用说上级还归还，就是不还，给前方战士吃了，也痛快。”灵邱四区口头村三十个妇女，在去年平绥战役时，曾运粮七百斤到三十里远的地方。灵邱一区下关的妇女每人背一箱子弹，背了八里地，很快的支援了前线战争的需要。去春敌人进攻满城时，情况非常紧急，易县东楼山村在敌情紧急时，男子参战走了，妇女们怕公粮受到损失，一夜往返两次，将六千余斤公粮运到界安。十二月大运粮中，大批儿童妇女不怕饥饿寒冷，赶着小驴送公粮到涿州……。
    接近火线村庄妇女冒雨抬担架转运伤员
    在接近火线的不少地方，由于需用的人力庞大，妇女往往直接参战。冀东玉田二区在一九四八年九月间，曾组织了妇女担架五十四付，冒雨转送伤员，沿途站岗放哨送信等工作也多由妇女担任。宝抵的瞬角、抵古二村，一次有五十八名妇女自动参加破击敌人交通。乐亭杨各庄战斗时，边流河、刘庄等村，四十余名妇女自动上火线抢运伤员，送水送饭在火线上坚持工作。在两次平保战役中，易县各村组织了慰问组，白堡村全体妇女在正副主任廉衣梅、赵桂芝领导下，在兵站招待伤员，接连三昼夜不睡觉。山北村刘玉华（小区委员）领导十三个村的妇女慰问伤员，冒着倾盆大雨，涉过大水，给伤员送东西……。

    妇女积极参加这些活动，是由于她们已经觉悟到军队打仗完全是为了人民，同时也是为了自己，有许多在旧社会地主的压榨下受过酸辛的妇女，她们总是念念不忘的经常的拿两个社会来对比。平谷县的模范军属张大娘说得好：“想起过去的苦日子，千秋万世也忘不了今天的恩人。”张大娘只是妇女中的一个，和她具有同样的思想自觉的，何止千万个？这就是战斗力量的源泉。
