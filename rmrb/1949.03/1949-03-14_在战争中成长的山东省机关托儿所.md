The construction of the liberated areas is the result of countless times of persisting in overcoming difficulties—this rule is no exception for nurseries. The Shandong Provincial Government and the three administrative offices of Jiaodong, Bohai, and Lucentral-Southern Shandong each have a nursery, caring for more than 380 children. Many of the cadres and nursery workers who bury themselves in their work in these nurseries are worthy of being called heroes; their perseverance in the face of serious difficulties is not easily imagined by ordinary people.

The provincial nursery cares for more than 80 infants and young children aged six months to seven years. This nursery has moved nine times in fourteen months in Lucentral, Lusouth, Jiaodong, and Northeast China. During the most tense period when the Kuomintang bandit army launched a key offensive against Shandong, the nursery scattered the children in the homes of farmers within a 70-mile radius. Cadres and nursery workers diligently helped their landlords with various tasks such as carrying water, grinding mills, and digging sweet potatoes, establishing close relationships with the residents, so that the children in their care received good protection and care.

During marches, the nursery was organized into several squadrons, which were further divided into groups, with each nursery worker caring for one nursing child or two non-nursing children. Their slogan was: "Everything for the protection of the children." When crossing the Wen River in Lucentral, the water was waist-deep and handcarts could not be pushed across. The nursery workers carried the carts and children on their backs across the river. Some physically weak female nursery workers became dizzy when they reached the middle of the river, and were helped by others, but they still carried the children on their backs. When there were few civilian laborers, the physically strong nursery workers personally pushed the carts. In Northeast China, on the section of road from Andong to Tonghua, the temperature was minus 40 degrees Celsius, and heavy snow was falling. They marched through two feet of snow. After arriving at their lodgings, they quickly washed the children's hands and faces with salt water. Although many cadres and nursery workers had frostbite on their hands and feet, none of the children suffered from frostbite or serious illnesses. No matter how tired or cold they were during the march, they persisted in the system of day and night duty, doing everything possible to ensure that the children were fed and watered on time. During the march, when they could not find boiled water, the staff went everywhere to collect firewood to boil water. When camping, no matter how far away they were from the market, they tried to buy fresh food for the children. Sometimes when they could not buy fresh vegetables, they gathered wild vegetables.

The Jiaodong Nursery was founded in 1941 in the wartime environment of enemy mopping-up operations and counter-mopping-up operations behind enemy lines. At the beginning of its establishment, all the children were scattered in more than 50 villages around Muping. There were nine inspectors in the nursery, who took turns inspecting and constantly educating the nursery workers and wet nurses. Therefore, in any tense and harsh environment, they could be vigilant and flexible in evading the enemy and protecting the children. During the Japanese army's mopping-up operation in the winter of 1942, two nursery workers, Li Yuhua and Guan Yuanhua, were surrounded in the enemy's encirclement and could not break through. They were determined to live and die with the children, wrapped the children in their arms, and hid in the bushes. The children's urine and feces flowed into their waistbands. They were shivering with cold, but they endured and persisted for a whole day and night until the enemy withdrew. The nursery worker Li Xiuzhen was captured by the Japanese army, but she still held the child tightly. Taking advantage of the enemy's busy gathering, she bravely escaped from the tiger's den.

On the way from Boshan to Yiyuan (a newly established county in the mountainous area north of Yishui) for the Lucentral-Southern Shandong Nursery, there was a shortage of civilian laborers and they encountered torrential rain. The nursery workers pushed the carts themselves and continued to advance. When transferring to Mengyin, Kuomintang planes actually used machine guns to strafe this group of young and weak children. With the nursery workers' resourceful cover, the children were safe. When crossing the Yellow River to the Bohai Sea area, there were strong winds and heavy rain that night, and it was so dark that you could not see your fingers. To prevent the children from falling off the cart, the nursery workers followed closely beside the cart. In this difficult and arduous march, they safely arrived on the west bank of the Yellow River.

### 在战争中成长的山东省机关托儿所

　　在战争中成长的山东省机关托儿所
    解放区的各项建设都是无数次坚持战胜困难的结果——这个规律对于托儿所也不是例外。山东的省政府和胶东、渤海、鲁中南三个行政公署各有一个托儿所，保育着三百八十多个儿童。在这些托儿所中埋头工作的干部和保育员们有许多是足够称为英雄人物的；她们在严重的困难面前所表现的坚毅精神，是普通人所不容易想象的。
    省立托儿所保育着八十多个半周岁至七岁的婴儿和幼孩。这个托儿所曾于十四个月中在鲁中、鲁南、胶东和东北转移过九次。在国民党匪军向山东作重点进攻的最紧张的时期，托儿所把孩子分散在四周七十多里以内的农民家里，干部和保育员们勤劳地替房东作担水、推碾磨、刨地瓜（红薯）等各种劳动，和居民建立了密切的感情，使被托托的孩子们得到很好的掩护和照顾。
    托儿所在行军中，编成为几个中队，在中队里面又分别地编成小组，每个保育员照顾一个吃奶的孩子或者是两个不吃奶的孩子。他们的口号是：“一切为了保护孩子。”在鲁中渡汶河时，水深齐腰，手车子无法推过，保育员们便抬着车子背着孩子渡过河水。有些身体弱的女保育员走到河中间时头发晕了，由其他人扶着走，但是仍然把孩子背在背上。民工少的时候，身体强壮的保育员就亲自推小车。在东北时，自安东至通化的一段路上，气温在零下四十度，大雪纷飞，他们踏着二尺深的积雪前进。到住地后，很快就用盐水给孩子们洗手洗脸，虽然很多干部和保育员手脚都冻坏了，而孩子们却没有一个患冻疮或患重病的。不管行军如何疲劳、寒冷，她们一直坚持了日夜值班的制度，尽一切可能保证按时给孩子们吃、喝。行军途中因找不到开水，工作人员们就遍地去拾柴草烧水。宿营时不管离集市多远，都要设法买新鲜的食物给孩子们吃。有时买不到新鲜菜蔬，便动手采野菜。
    胶东托儿所创立于一九四一年敌后扫荡与反扫荡的战争环境中。创办时，孩子全部被分散在牟平一带的五十多个村庄里。所内有九个巡视员，轮番检查，经常教育保育员奶母们，因此在任何紧张恶劣的环境下，都能机警灵活地躲过敌人保护了孩子。一九四二年冬日寇扫荡时，李玉华、官元华两个保育员被包围在敌人的合击圈里，无法突围，他们就下定决心与孩子共生死，将孩子裹在自己怀里，隐蔽在树丛中，孩子的尿和屎都流在她们的裤腰里，她们冻得发抖，但始终忍耐着坚持了一天一夜，直至敌人撤走。保育员李秀珍被日寇俘去，仍然一直抱着孩子不放，乘敌人集合忙乱时，勇敢地逃出了虎穴。
    鲁中南托儿所从博山撤向沂源（新设县，位沂水北部山区）的中途，缺少民工，又遇了倾盆大雨，保育员们便自己动手推小车，继续前进。向蒙阴转移时，国民党飞机竟用机枪对着这一群幼弱者扫射。有了保育员们的机智掩护，孩子们才得到了安全。转向渤海区过黄河时，当夜狂风暴雨，天黑得伸手不见五指，为预防孩子们从大车上摔下，保育员们紧跟在车旁。她们就在这样困难重重的行军里，一直安全地抵达黄河西岸。（新华社华东十日电）
