Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, March 13th: The Indian government has adopted several fascist-style extraordinary military measures to destroy the democratic movement and attempt to suppress the impending general strike of railway workers. According to a TASS dispatch from Delhi on the 10th: Martial law has been imposed in Indian cities and stations. Calcutta and Mumbai are heavily guarded by troops, and armed forces guard stations, telephone bureaus, telegraph bureaus, power stations, and parking lots. Arrests of communists and democrats continue across India. According to an Associated Press report: Mumbai authorities issued "emergency security measures" on the 6th to bloodily suppress strikes, stipulating that "police and guards should immediately shoot anyone found attempting to interfere with railways and other necessary public utility assets."
