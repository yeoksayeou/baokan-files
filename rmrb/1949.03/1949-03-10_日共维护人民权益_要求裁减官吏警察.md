Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 8th. TASS, Tokyo, 4th: A delegation of the Japanese Communist Party (JCP) led by Shiga Yoshio, a member of the JCP Politburo, visited the official residence of Japanese Prime Minister Yoshida to hear the government's explanation of its plan to reorganize government agencies and reduce staff. After meeting with Cabinet Secretary-General Masuda Kojiro (erroneously reported previously as Masuda Kineji), Shiga told reporters: The main purpose of the Japanese government's so-called "administrative organization reorganization plan" is to weaken Japanese labor unions. Formal staff reductions in local government agencies will allow local magnates to maintain their power. Shiga declared: We demand a major reduction in personnel in the police and prisons and other agencies that suppress the people, and the expulsion of senior officials from the bureaucracy. Refuting the claim that the "administrative reorganization plan" is intended to reduce the burden on the people, Shiga said: Since the government is strengthening the police force and intensifying tax collection agencies, the people's tax burden will become even heavier. Shiga said: Government representatives insisted that unemployment relief funds are 1,400 yen per person per month, but in reality, it is only 200 yen. Shiga then said that the government claims that the number of unemployed will reach 1.6 million, but the actual number of unemployed will exceed 10 million, because those who are currently partially employed will soon become completely unemployed. If the families of the unemployed are included, the total number of unemployed in Japan will reach 25 percent of the total Japanese population. (Note: According to official Japanese statistics at the end of last December, the Japanese population was 80 million.)

　　日共维护人民权益  要求裁减官吏警察
    【新华社陕北八日电】塔斯社东京四日讯：日共政治局委员志贺义雄所率领的日共代表团，曾访日首相吉田的官邸，听取政府方面解释政府重整政府机关及裁员的计划。志贺在与内阁书记长增田甲子七（前误为增田杵七）会谈后告记者称：日政府所施行的所谓“行政机构重整计划”的主要目的，乃在削弱日本工会。地方政府机关的正式裁员，将使地方豪绅能保持其势力。志贺宣称：我们要求大事裁减警察及监狱等镇压人民的机关中的人员，并把高级官员从官僚机关中驱逐出去。志贺于驳斥所谓“行政重整计划”是为了减轻人民负担时称：既然政府增强警察力量并加强税收机构，则人民的赋税负担，将更加沉重。志贺说：政府代表硬说每月每人的失业救济费为一千四百日元，而实际上仅二百日元。志贺接着说，政府声称，失业人数将达一百六十万，但实际的失业人数将超过一千万，因为目前部分就业的人，即将变成完全失业者。如果计入失业者的家属，则日本失业总数，将达日本人口总数的百分之二十五（按：据日本官方去年十二月底统计，日本人口为八千万。）
