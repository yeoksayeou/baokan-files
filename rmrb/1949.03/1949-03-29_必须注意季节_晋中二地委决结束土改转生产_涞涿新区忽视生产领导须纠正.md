　　Must Pay Attention to the Season
　　Jinzhong Second Prefectural Committee Decides to End Land Reform and Shift to Production
　　Neglecting Production Leadership in Laizhuo New District Must Be Corrected
　　[Chahar News] In Laizhuo's second, third, fourth, and sixth districts, and Laishui Township, 76 villages undergoing land reform had largely completed land distribution in 62 villages by the 17th of this month and transitioned to production. The other 14 villages are also preparing for distribution to avoid delaying agricultural work. Simultaneously with land reform, the aforementioned villages thoroughly destroyed the Baojia system and established peasant representative assemblies, further boosting the peasants' enthusiasm for production. On the 15th of this month, after land distribution in Chengguan, households rushed to plant hemp on the former Kuomintang bandit army's trenches and blockhouses. Zhang Ying'er, a 13-year-old girl in Chengdong Street, planted over 270 hemp seedlings in one day. The peasant organization's work exchange group three in the city, along with two women's work exchange groups, began cultivating the land. In Xujiazhuang and Zhuangding villages, 38 people organized five work exchange groups, dug four wells, and planted 35 mu of barley. In other villages, such as Wangzhuang village, peasants are adding vehicles and transporting manure. Local women generally lacked the habit of labor, but a few women in Sanlipu and Changding villages are carrying soil together with men to build pigsties. In addition, peasants have shown a high degree of production enthusiasm after being emancipated, whether in preparing seeds or increasing the purchase of agricultural tools. However, county and district cadres have shown spontaneity and insufficient attention to production work. For example, in six villages in Laishui Township, and over ten villages including Dongchangtie in the third and second districts, land has basically been evenly distributed. The higher authorities had already pointed out that these villages should focus on production and solve the problem of land replenishment in conjunction with production; however, the work teams are still stubbornly focusing on land reform, neglecting production leadership. Other villages are also only concerned with land reform or distributing floating wealth first without seizing the time to distribute land. (Fang Shu)

　　[Jinzhong Electric] The Jinzhong Second Prefectural Committee convened a joint meeting of county party secretaries, determining that spring plowing and production should be the central task, rapidly concluding land reform, and vigorously leading the masses in spring plowing. Currently, among the 825 new district villages in the entire sub-district, the first batch of 365 villages undergoing land reform has been fully completed and transitioned to production. Among the second batch of 273 villages undergoing land reform, 257 villages have been completed or are in progress, and the others are villages adjusting land or not carrying out land reform. Based on this, the prefectural committee convened a joint meeting of county secretaries on the 15th of this month, deciding as follows: (1) To rapidly and cautiously end land reform by the end of March, adopting four working methods according to the different progress: 1. Villages that have completed land reform should immediately shift to production. 2. Villages that are in progress should be completed as soon as possible, and the distribution of floating wealth should prioritize livestock, agricultural tools, and grain related to production to solve difficulties in production. 3. Villages adjusting land should only adjust public land such as temples, societies, schools, and households, and the land of other classes should not be touched. It should be announced to maintain the status quo, with whoever plants reaping the harvest. 4. Villages that have been adjusted in the past or are not planning to adjust will no longer be touched; villages in the old areas that have not completed land reform will also be announced to be untouched. In particular, in villages that have suspended land reform and land adjustment, cadres, the masses, especially poor and hired peasants, should be informed that this is being done to avoid hindering production.

　　必须注意季节
    晋中二地委决结束土改转生产       
    涞涿新区忽视生产领导须纠正
    【察哈尔讯】涞涿二、三、四、六区及涞水城厢区，七十六个进行土地改革村庄，截至本月十七日止，已有六十二个村土地大体分妥，转入生产。其他十四个村庄亦正准备分配，做到不误农时。上述村庄，与土改同时，彻底摧毁了保甲组织，建立了农民代表会，农民生产情绪越加高涨。本月十五日城关分配土地后，各户抢着在过去国民党匪军壕沟、碉堡占地上点种大麻子，城东街十三岁的女孩子张英儿一天点种二百七十余棵。城内农民组织拨工组三组，另有两个妇女拨工组，开始耕地；许家庄、庄町两村三十八人组织五个拨工组，打好水井四眼，并种大麦三十五亩。其他各村如王庄村农民正在添购车辆，拨工送粪。当地妇女素无劳动习惯，但三里铺、长町等村少数妇女却与男子一起抬土垫圈。此外，无论在准备籽种，增购农具等方面，都表现了农民翻身后的高度生产积极性；但县、区干部对生产工作的领导却表现了自流和不够重视。如涞水城厢区六个村，三、二区东常贴等十余村，土地基本上已经平分，上级早已指出这些村庄要以生产为主，结合解决土地抽补问题；但工作组仍是硬钻土改，忽视生产领导，其他村亦有只顾土改或先分配浮财而不抓紧分配土地的现象。

    【晋中电】晋中二地委召开县委书记联席会议，确定以春耕生产为中心工作，迅速结束土地改革，大力领导群众进行春耕。目前全分区的八百二十五个新区的村庄中，第一批进行土改的三百六十五个村，已全部完成，转入生产；第二批开展土改的二百七十三个村中，已有二百五十七个村结束或正在进行中，其他皆为调剂土地或不进行土改的村。据此，地委于本月十五日召集县书联席会议，决定如下：（一）迅速而慎重的于三月底结束土改，以进度不同的情况，采取四种工作方法：一、已结束土改的村庄，立即转入生产。二、正在进行的村庄，要尽快完成，分配浮财要先分与生产有关的牲畜、农具、粮食等，以解决生产中的困难。三、调剂土地的村庄，只调剂公庙、社、学、户等公共土地，其他各阶层土地一律不抽动，宣布维持现状，谁种谁收。四、过去经过调剂或不计划调剂的村庄则不再动；老区未结束土地改革的村庄也宣布不动。特别是在中止土地改革与调剂土地的村庄、要向干部、群众，尤其是贫雇农说明是为不妨碍生产才这样作的。
