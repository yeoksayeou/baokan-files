　　Xi Wendian's Communications Group
　　——Introducing a New Approach to Political Work in the Military
　　Ke Ren
　　Xi Wendian's communications group conducts external reporting, organizes internal reading of newspapers, and organizes blackboard newspapers. During the Jinan Campaign, his company published more than sixty issues of blackboard newspapers and wall newspapers, and the platoons published one hundred and forty issues. During marches, they also created forms such as newspaper relays, so that everyone could know the day's news on the same day. Closely integrated with ideology, work, study, and life, it became the soldiers' most beloved garden. During breaks in combat or marches, small groups of literate people would sit together to write articles, while those who could not read would conduct interviews or draw pictures, so that those who could write and those who could not would cooperate. Everyone was busy, and in order to report a material completely, everyone would study it specifically, supplement the material, and write separately. They wrote articles in a timely manner, often finishing battles in the middle of the night and sending batches of articles to the company headquarters in the morning. In three months, the blackboard newspapers and external reports (including those for the regiment and brigade newspapers) totaled 282 articles. With the active development of communication work, their barracks became a school.
　　The development of the Xi Wendian Communications Group was not smooth sailing, but was consolidated by constantly solving practical problems. At the beginning, everyone thought it was "just propaganda" and felt it was "not important," "no time," "a waste of effort," and some even thought it was "selling dog skin plaster." "Writing articles can't replace fighting; you throw a grenade twenty meters, and writing an article doesn't make it any further." This caused soldiers who were enthusiastic about writing to be ridiculed when they picked up a pen, so they stopped writing. Xi Wendian did not complain about others, but felt that "this is our work not being thorough enough." At this time, he first started by clearing the communicators' minds. After He Jinxiang was ridiculed by others, he also felt that "the communications group has no effect." Xi Wendian first enlightened him: "Are you happy when you are praised?" He Jinxiang said, "Happy!" Then Xi Wendian said, "Praise can improve morale. Can you do a good job without morale?" This cleared the communicators' minds. Xue Gou'lai and Liu Guangwang of the first squad felt more motivated after being published in the newspaper. Jiang Qiyun, who used to lag behind, said after being praised, "Since I've been praised, I dare not lag behind anymore." Lü Wujin automatically threw a grenade during a break, and after being published in the newspaper, he soon threw it from thirty-five meters to fifty meters. Everyone discussed, "Look, does writing articles replace throwing grenades?" Many people changed from opposition to support. Yang Baofu, the deputy platoon leader of the first platoon, used to disagree with everyone writing articles, but later urged everyone to write articles. At this time, the quartermaster and cook also joined the communications group, and it quickly grew from twenty-six people to fifty-three people.
　　With the development of the communications group, the number of articles also increased, but the quality decreased. The regiment repeatedly returned many articles, and the company's blackboard newspaper could not use them all, so the articles had no outlet. Xi Wendian discovered this problem and sought the opinions of the communicators. Everyone said, "Writing a lot is useless." He quickly asked everyone to come up with ideas. Li Guilin and Zhang Desheng proposed increasing the platoon blackboard newspapers. The soldiers shouted, "Our platoon has a blackboard newspaper; quickly put it on our blackboard newspaper." After the mass commendation was carried out, everyone became more active, and the company's atmosphere became more lively. Because Xi Wendian's communications group combined communication reporting with commending models, cultural learning, and cultural entertainment, it became one of the main components of the company's political work. At the same time, the communications group also established a solid foundation in the company. Its main experiences are as follows:
　　(1) Starting from commendation: At that time, Xi Wendian seized the opportunity to give full play to the positive factors of the masses and proposed "whoever is good, write about them," boldly letting go. Some people doubted that backward elements would not change after being commended, but the facts developed in the opposite direction. Old soldier Song Ping'an, who used to be a soldier that no squad wanted, became an active element after being commended for enforcing discipline, and performed meritorious service in the Jinan Campaign. Xi Wendian stipulated that soldiers should recognize three characters every day, and they insisted on learning five characters, hoping to be able to read the newspaper soon. People who were literate also made progress because they often wrote articles and paid attention to the advantages of others. After the Xiangling battle, 56% of the communicators performed meritorious service, and sixteen backward elements made progress. Many people clamored to join the communications group, and those who were illiterate also used drawing to replace writing, all vying to be reported.
　　(2) Closely combining with the central work of each period: They wrote about whatever they did. Whenever a central task arrived, they would arrange for the communicators to collect materials, report in a timely manner, and clarify the task. During the Quwo battle, Company Commander Jing Laifa proposed, "Strive to be a model unit of discipline and policy." After everyone responded, the communications group immediately wrote an article and published it in the newspaper. The soldiers saw the newspaper and said, "Our affairs are mentioned in the newspaper; it would be a shame if we couldn't do it." Everyone was determined to say, "We will definitely do it well," and quickly improved everyone's morale. They promoted the work by closely combining with reality and mastering reality.
　　(3) Promote work by promoting typical examples: In addition to general reporting, Xi Wendian's communications group paid more attention to what the troops needed and wrote about it. Need was their measure for promoting typical examples. This year, the troops were engaged in a campaign to pour out grievances, but the campaign could not be carried out in depth. At that time, the typical example of Li Jihai's pouring out grievances was found and reported, and forms such as quick talk were adopted. After hearing it, liberated soldier Cai Zhongjiang said with emotion, "Because he fed a landlord's ox and made it sick, the landlord made the whole family like this." "I also have such suffering." The entire company's pouring out grievances went in depth.

　　席文殿的通讯组
    ——介绍一个部队政治工作的新方式
    克仁
    席文殿通讯组，对外进行报导，对内组织读报，并组织了黑板报，在晋南战役中，他连内的黑板报、墙报出版了六十余期，班里出了一百四十期，行军时还创造了传达报等形式，使大家当天能知道当天的消息，密切结合着思想、工作、学习、生活，成为战士们最热爱的园地；在战斗或行军的空隙，识字的三五成群坐在一起写稿，不识字的就采访或画画，使会写的与不会写的都合作起来。大家都忙个不止，为了把一个材料报导完整，大家具体研究，补充材料，分头去写。他们写稿很及时，常常是半夜结束战斗，早晨就有成批的稿子送到连部，三个月中，黑板报和对外报导的稿子（包括给团、旅报纸）达二百八十二篇之多，在通讯工作的积极发展中，他们的兵营变成了学校。
    席文殿通讯组的发展并不是一帆风顺的，而是在不断解决实际问题中得到巩固，开始时大家认为“宣传宣传罢了，”都觉得“不重要”。“没时间”、“白费工”、有的还认为“这是卖狗皮膏药”，“写稿不能顶打仗，你投弹二十米，写了稿还不是二十米。”致使有热情写稿的战士提起笔来，被别人嘲笑，而不写了。席文殿没有埋怨别人，只觉得“这是咱的工作不到”——这时，他首先从打通通讯员的思想着手，何金祥受到别人讽刺后，也觉得“通讯组没啥作用”。席文殿先作了启发：“你受了表扬高兴不高兴？”何金祥说：“高兴！”接着席文殿又说：“表扬能提高情绪，没情绪还能够作好工作？”这样打通了通讯员的思想。一班的薛狗来、刘光旺登报后情绪高了。爱掉队的蒋启云，经过了表扬，他说：“表扬了咱，可不敢再掉队了。”吕五斤在休息时自动投弹，登报后，不久由三十五米投到五十米，大家议论着：“你看写稿顶不顶投弹。”许多人由反对变为拥护了。一排副杨保福，过去不同意大家写稿子，以后却督促大家写稿，这时，事军长、炊事员也参加了通讯组，很快就由二十六人发展到五十三人。
    随着通讯组的发展，稿件也增多了，质量却减低了，团里屡次打回不少的稿子，连里的一块黑板报也用不完，稿子没有出路。席文殿发现了这个问题，就征求通讯员的意见，大家说：“写的多没用处。”他很快找大家想办法。李桂林、张德胜提出增加班、排黑板报。战士们嚷着：“咱班有了黑板报，快上咱的黑板报。”群众性的表扬开展后，大家更积极了，连队空气更活跃了。因为席文殿通讯组把通讯报导与表扬模范、文化学习、文化娱乐等工作结合进行，所以它成了连队政治工作中主要组成部分之一。同时，通讯组在连队里，也树立了巩固的基础。它的主要经验有以下的几点：
    （一）从表扬出发：当时席文殿抓紧了发挥了群众的积极因素，提出了“谁好就写谁”，大胆放手。有些人怀疑落后分子受到表扬后也不会转变，可是事实发展却相反。老战士宋平安，过去是哪一班也不要的战士，在执行纪律上得到表扬后，就一变为积极份子，在晋南战役中立了功。席文殿规定战士每天认三个字，他们定要学会五个字，希望很快能看清报纸。识字的人由于经常的写稿，注意别人的优点，也有了进步。襄陵战斗以后，通讯员立功的有百分之五十六，有十六个落后份子进步了。许多人闹着要参加通讯组，不识字也要用画画代替写稿，都争着上报。
    （二）紧紧结合各个时期中心工作：他们干什么就写什么，每当一个中心任务到来，就布置通讯员搜集材料，及时报导，明确任务。曲沃战斗中，连长荆来发提出：“争取纪律政策的模范单位”。大家响应后，通讯组马上写了稿子在报上登出，战士们看到报纸说：“咱们的事却提到报纸上了，作不到可丢人。”大家都下决心说：“保险作得好，”迅速提高了大家的情绪，他们在紧紧结合实际，掌握实际中，推动了工作。
    （三）发扬典型推动工作，席文殿的通讯组，除了一般报导，更注意到部队需要什么就写什么，需要就是他们发挥典型的尺度，今年部队在诉苦运动中，运动深入不下去，当时找出李计孩的典型诉苦进行报导，并采取快板等形式，解放战士蔡中江听到后感动的说：“因为把地主一个牛喂病了，就被地主把一家人弄成这个样子”，“象这样的苦我也有。”全连的诉苦就深入了。
