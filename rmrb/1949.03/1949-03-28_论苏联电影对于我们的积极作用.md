　　On the Positive Role of Soviet Films for Us

　　There was a considerably long period when we had little chance to see Soviet films in Beiping, Tianjin, and other cities under the rule of the Kuomintang reactionaries. Soviet films were imprisoned for many years. The reason is simple: because it serves the revolution and the people, and is needed by the vast oppressed classes of China, because it is completely different from the Hollywood films that spread American imperialist culture. Now, wherever the people's armed forces reach, the shackles that imprisoned Soviet films have been shattered. We are now completely able to watch "Zoya," "The Village Teacher" ("The Paragon of Teachers"), and "The Vow" as we please.

　　What kind of films are "Zoya," "The Village Teacher," and "The Vow"? Why are such films needed by us? Among general audiences, or many who are infatuated with "Arabian Nights," "Bathing Beauty," "Spring in a Small Town," and "Atomic Bomb Secret," there may be another kind of view and thought; but the vast majority of the audience, I believe, are willing to understand such questions. And it is necessary to understand such questions so that we can thoroughly distinguish what is good for us from what is harmful to us, so that we will not enter a treasure mountain empty-handed.

　　The development of Soviet cinema has been accompanied by the development of the proletarian socialist revolution from the beginning, and has been based on the principle of thoroughly serving the proletarian socialist revolution, and has been developed under the correct guidance and active support of the Lenin-Stalin Party. Like other departments of art, for thirty-two years, Soviet films have always been truly people's films, revolutionary art, and the most progressive culture in the world. With clear ideological principles and Party spirit, taking the patriotism of the Soviet people as the basic theme, mastering the creative method of socialist realism, and reflecting the real life of the Soviet people (present and historical) through the form of film, it has created the image of typical people's heroes. Zoya, who was brutally murdered by the Hitler bandits, Varvara Vasilyevna, who devoted her life to education, and Varvara, who persisted to the final victory of the Battle of Stalingrad, are such figures. Such characters and their ordinary but heroic deeds could not have arisen in countries ruled by a few reactionary groups, and would never appear in films produced in such countries.

　　Although we have only seen a few films such as "Zoya," "The Village Teacher," and "The Vow" so far, even these few films have had a very significant positive effect on us, on the Chinese people who are carrying out the War of Liberation.

　　This positive effect is, first of all, to educate the audience (as far as cities like Beiping and Tianjin are concerned, the audience includes workers, students, intellectuals, petty citizens, general laborers, and housewives), making it possible for them to liberate themselves from the influence of imperialist (mainly American) culture and from the influence of semi-colonial and semi-feudal culture. As is well known, taking Beiping or Tianjin as an example, nine out of ten of the foreign films shown in the past three years spread American imperialist culture, and seven or eight out of ten of the domestic films were products influenced by Hollywood. Love, detective stories, spies, martial arts, myths, songs, and dances are needless to say, even the "A-level films" once praised by some petty-bourgeois intellectuals, as Jin Feng pointed out in his article "The True Face of Hollywood": "War propaganda films made in the United States (against Germany and Japan)... in essence, instigate narrow patriotism to drive the masses to war, exaggerate the strength and achievements of the United States, use 'American' viewpoints to understand the Allied countries and write out unrealistic situations, use vulgar love stories to dilute the bloody nature of war, and use limited and trivial views to distort the true meaning of war..." As for "film companies spending high prices every year to buy dozens of literary 'masterpieces' to make films... most of them cater to the tastes of petty citizens, 'popular' works that are difficult to jump out of the circle of eroticism and romance, and are nothing more than decadent and mysterious." It is not difficult for us to imagine that when the audience is immersed in such films for a long time, they will inevitably be blurred in their correct understanding of real life and the surrounding world, and will be intentionally or unintentionally captured by such films and become prisoners of the reactionary ruling class, making it difficult to extricate themselves. After the liberation of cities such as Beiping and Tianjin, we must demand the ideological liberation of the people, and liberating the general audience from the influence of American films (almost all of them) and some bad domestic films cannot but be a matter of urgency, because this is a part of the people's ideological liberation. Cooperating with the screening of Chinese people's films (such as the various episodes of "Democratic Northeast" produced by the Northeast Film Studio in Pingjin), Soviet films cannot but be a strong allied force. Moreover, through Soviet films, many people who have been deceived by the anti-Soviet propaganda of the Kuomintang reactionaries will correctly understand what kind of country the Soviet Union is, and why only the Soviet Union is the first "nation to treat me with equality." It is also a strong guarantee for the friendship between the socialist Soviet Union and the New Democratic China in the future.

　　This positive effect, secondly, is to educate the intellectuals who have participated in and are preparing to participate in the New Democratic Revolution, inspire and strengthen their determination to serve the people. Yes, Zoya is a member of the Communist Youth League, and isn't that Varvara Vasilyevna who taught in Siberia for thirty years an ordinary intellectual? The question is not who they are, but in what era and under what kind of social system they are, that they have such achievements. Without the correct leadership of the Soviet Communist Party, the socialist Soviet Union would not have been established, a generation of young people like Zoya would not have been cultivated, and the final victory of the Patriotic War would not have been achieved. Without the socialist Soviet Union, Varvara Vasilyevna would have had difficulty developing in the last twenty years. "The Village Teacher" has clearly compared the significant difference between education under the Tsar and education in the Soviet Union! As early as the reactionary era of Stolypin in Tsarist Russia, the Bolsheviks pointed out that without overthrowing the Tsarist system, there could be no era of cultural upsurge. "The Village Teacher" precisely confirms this conclusion. Today, we Chinese intellectuals are standing under the banner of New Democracy, on the one hand, the revolution requires intellectuals to serve the people, and on the other hand, the victory of the revolution has prepared the necessary conditions for serving the people, that is, there is a full guarantee for intellectuals to better serve the people. Not only that, but in the period of the Agrarian Revolution, in the period of the War of Resistance Against Japan, and in the period of the People's Liberation War, in fact, we already have people's heroes like Zoya, like Varvara, and like Varvara Vasilyevna.

　　This positive effect, finally, is to educate progressive film, drama, and art workers, and explain the creative method of revolutionary art—people's art with concrete examples: including the unity of content and form, and the combination of thought and technology. Because, as mentioned earlier, in fact we already have people's heroes like Zoya, like Varvara, like Varvara Vasilyevna, in fact we have many ordinary but heroic deeds, as we read and hear in communications and reports, which need to be reflected in various creations by film, drama, and art workers. Soviet films, because they are also people's films, give us the richest and most valuable reference, which no Hollywood "blockbuster" can compare with.

　　Because Soviet films have such a significant positive effect on us, as a Chinese people, as an intellectual, as a drama and film art worker, we urgently need a wider and more universal screening of Soviet films. At the same time, we more urgently hope for the long-term development of China's people's film industry, which will undoubtedly more effectively fulfill the above-mentioned positive effects and complete the task of Chinese people's films.

### 论苏联电影对于我们的积极作用

　　论苏联电影对于我们的积极作用
    曾经有过一个相当长久的时期，在被国民党反动派统治下的北平、天津和其他城市里，我们很难有机会看到苏联电影。苏联电影多年来被困禁着。这理由很简单，因为它是服务于革命与人民，而为中国广大被压迫阶级所需要的电影，因为它是完全不同于那种传播美帝国主义文化的好莱坞出品的电影。现在，在人民武装力量所及的地方，这困禁着苏联电影的枷锁被粉碎了。我们已经完全可能随心所欲的看到了“丹娘”、“乡村女教员”（“万世师表”）和“宣誓”了：
    苏联电影：“丹娘”、“乡村女教员”、“宣誓”，是怎样的电影呢？这样的电影为什么是我们所需要的呢？在一般观众中，或不少迷恋于“天方夜谭”、“出水芙蓉”、“春风化雨”、“原子弹秘密”的人吧，他们另有一种看法与想法；而绝大多数的观众，我相信，是愿意理解这样问题的。也必须理解了这样问题，我们才可以彻底分清什么是于我们有好处的，什么是于我们有害处的，我们才可以不至于空入宝山。
    苏联电影发展的历程是由一开始就是伴结着无产阶级社会主义革命发展着的，就是基于彻底服务于无产阶级社会主义革命这一原则而发展着的，也就是在列宁——斯大林党的正确指导和积极扶植之下发展着的。和其他部门的艺术一样，三十二年来，苏联电影始终是真正的人民的电影，革命的艺术，全世界上最进步的文化。具有明确的思想原则、党性，以苏联人民的爱国主义为基本主题，掌握了社会主义现实主义的创作方法，通过电影这一种形式，正确的反映了苏联人民的现实生活（现在的和历史的），从而创造了典型的人民英雄的形象。被希特勒匪徒惨杀了的索亚，毕生从事教育的华尔华娜·华西里芙娜和坚持到斯大林格勒保卫战最后胜利的瓦尔瓦娜，就是这样的人物。这样的人物及其平凡而英勇的事迹，不可能产生于那些被少数反动集团统治的国度中，也就永远不可能出现于那种国度所产生的电影里。
    虽然目前我们只不过看到了如“丹娘”、“乡村女教员”和“宣誓”少数几部，而就是这少数几部，对于我们，对于进行解放战争的中国人民，已是有着非常显著的积极作用的。
    这种积极作用，首先是教育了观众（就如北平、天津这样的城市来说，观众的成份包括了工人、学生、知识分子、小市民、一般劳动者及家庭妇女），使他们有可能从帝国主义的（主要的是美国的）文化的影响下，从半殖民地半封建的文化影响下解放出来了。如所周知，以北平或天津为例，过去三年所放映过的电影，外国影片十之九是传播美帝国主义文化的，国产影片十之七八是好莱坞影响下的产物。爱情、侦探、间谍、武打、神怪、歌舞之类，不必说了，就是曾为某些小资产阶级知识分子所赞许的“Ａ级片”，正如金锋在“好莱坞真面目”一文中所指出的那样：“美国摄制的（对德意志、日本的）战争宣传片……实质上，鼓吹狭隘爱国主义去驱使大众走向战争，夸张美国的力量和功绩，用‘美式’观点去了解盟国而写出不符实际的情形，用庸俗的恋爱故事去冲淡了战争的血腥，用局限的琐碎的看法去歪曲战争的真实意义……”至于“电影公司每年都会出高价收买几十本文艺‘名著’来摄制影片……大都是迎合小市民脾胃的‘流行’的作品，难以跳出色情与浪漫的圈子，也不外是颓废与神秘。”我们不难想象，当观众长久的浸沉于这样的电影之中，必然的被模糊了对于现实生活与周遭世界的正确认识，有意无意的由这样的电影的俘虏成为反动统治阶级的俘虏，难于自拔自脱了。当北平、天津等城市解放之后，我们必然要求人民思想上的解放，而使一般观众从美国电影（差不多是全部）与某些恶劣的国产电影的影响下解放出来，不能不是当务之急，因为这正是人民思想解放中的一部份。配合着中国的人民电影（如东北电影制片厂在平、津放映的“民主东北”各辑）的放映，苏联电影不能不是一支强有力的友军。并且，通过苏联电影，将使许多曾被国民党反动派的反苏宣传所蒙蔽的人民，正确的理解了苏联是怎样的国家，何以只有苏联才是第一个“以平等待我之民族”。对于今后社会主义的苏联与新民主主义的中国这两大民族的友谊，也是一个有力的保证。
    这种积极作用，其次，是教育了已经参加和准备参加新民主主义革命事业的知识分子，激发了并且加强了他们为人民服务的决心。是的，索亚是一个共产主义青年团团员，而那个三十年来在西伯利亚教书的华尔华娜·华西里芙娜，不是一个普普通通的知识分子吗？问题不在于他们谁是怎样的人，而在于他们处于怎样的时代、处于怎样的社会制度之下，才有这样的成就。没有苏联共产党的正确领导，不会建立了社会主义的苏联，不会培育了如索亚这样一代青年，也不会有卫国战争的最后胜利。没有社会主义的苏联，华尔华娜·华西里芙娜就难有后二十年的发展。“乡村女教员”已经明白的比较出来，在沙皇统治下的教育与苏联的教育有着何等显著的区别！还在沙俄历史上的斯托雷平反动年代，布尔什维克党人就指出了，不推翻沙皇制度，不可能有文化高涨的时代。“乡村女教员”恰好证实了这一论断。今天，我们中国的知识分子正站在新民主主义的旗帜下行进着，一方面革命要求知识分子为人民服务，一方面革命胜利已经给为人民服务准备了必要条件，即有着充分的保障使知识分子更好的为人民服务了。不仅如此，在土地革命时期，在抗日战争时期，在人民解放战争时期，事实上我们已经有了如索亚，有了如瓦尔瓦娜，有了如华尔华娜·华西里芙娜那样的人民英雄。
    这种积极作用，最后，是教育了进步的电影、戏剧、艺术工作者，以具体的例证解释了革命艺术——人民艺术的创作的方法：包括了内容与形式的统一，思想与技术的结合。因为，如前所说，事实上我们已经有了如索亚，如瓦尔瓦娜，如华尔华娜·华西里芙娜那样的人民英雄，事实上我们有了多少平凡而英勇的事迹，如我们在通讯与报告中所读到的以及耳闻目击的，正需要电影、戏剧、艺术工作者反映在各种创作里。苏联电影，由于它也是人民的电影之故，恰恰给与我们最丰富的、最有价值的参考，而是任何好莱坞的“巨片”所不能与之比拟的。
    由于苏联电影对于我们有这样显著的积极作用，做为一个中国人民、做为一个知识分子、做为一个戏剧、电影艺术工作者，我们是迫切需要着苏联电影的更广泛的、更普遍的放映的。同时，我们更迫切的希望着中国的人民电影事业的长足发展，无疑的，它将更有力的尽到了上述的积极作用，完成了中国人民电影的任务。
