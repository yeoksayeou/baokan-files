　　First Group of New Students at North China University Officially Begin Classes
    [Ping City News] The first group of over one thousand new students enrolled by North China University in Ping City officially began classes on the 15th. At 1 PM, the opening ceremony for the thirty-first, second, third, fourth, and fifth classes was held in the First District Team Headquarters of the university's First Division (formerly the Engineering Institute of Northeastern University). Vice President Fan Wenlan explained that intellectuals possess great revolutionary potential, while also pointing out shortcomings such as some people looking down on workers and peasants and being able to talk but not act. He encouraged the students to resolve to transform themselves and cure these problems. Finally, new students from each class performed entertainment programs. Many faculty and students joined in a Yangge dance, and the conference ended in joyful singing and dancing. (Bai Jin)

　　华大首批新生现已正式开学
    【平市讯】华北大学在平招收的首批新生一千余人，已于十五日正式开学。下午一时在该校第一部第一区队部（原东北大学工院）举行三十一、二、三、四、五等五个班开班典礼。范文澜副校长一方面说明知识分子有很大革命性，一方面也指出有些人看不起工农大众，能说不能行等缺点。他勖勉同学们下决心改造自己，治好这些毛病。最后，由各班新同学演出余兴节目，好些教职员和同学们一起扭大秧歌，大会在欢腾的歌舞中结束。　（白金）
