The delegates attending the congress came from the five major liberated areas of Northwest, Northeast, East China, North China, and Central Plains, as well as the Kuomintang-controlled areas, including female workers, rural working women, scientific experts, combat heroes, long-time leaders of the women's movement, and representatives from other fields, totaling 411 people.

More than 160 women from all walks of life attended as observers. The venue prominently displayed a huge portrait of Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu, along with three large banners that read: "Unite all Chinese women, and strive for genuine peace and women's liberation," "Organize the vast number of women in the liberated areas, actively develop production, support the front lines, and participate in various construction projects," and "Unite democratic women worldwide to stop new aggression and protect the lasting peace of mankind," expressing the direction of Chinese women's efforts in the future. The brocade banners sent to the congress from all sides were dazzling. Chairman Mao's inscription read: "Strive to increase production and fight for democratic rights." Commander-in-Chief Zhu's inscription was: "At present, the focus of women's work should shift to the cities, to do female worker work, and women's united front work," becoming the central guidance of the congress.
