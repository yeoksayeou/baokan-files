　　【Our News】Thanks to the efforts of workers in rushing repairs, most of the lines under the jurisdiction of the Pingjin Railway Administration have been opened to traffic. The average number of passengers boarding and alighting trains per day is approximately 70,000, with peak days exceeding 80,000. The daily military and freight traffic of the Bureau reaches over 30,000 tons, with a total of 971.7 kilometers of railway lines in operation. The following is a summary of the traffic conditions on the Pingjin, PingSui, PingHan, Jinpu, and PingGu lines:
 
　　1. Beining Line: Beijing to Shanhaiguan, a total of 432.5 kilometers, including: (1) Between Pingjin (139.4 kilometers), there are three pairs of express trains daily (travel time requires 3 hours and 5 minutes), departing from Pingjin at 8:00, 13:00, and 18:00 respectively. In addition, there are two pairs of ordinary express trains and one pair of mixed trains departing from the West Station. (2) Between Pingyu: One pair of ordinary express trains daily (travel time requires more than 12 hours due to train crossings), and one pair of mixed trains. (3) Between Jinyu: One pair of ordinary express trains daily. (4) Between Jintang: One pair of mixed trains daily.
 
　　2. Pingsui Line: Beijing to Zhangjiakou, transport vehicles can reach Yongjiabao, a total of 275.9 kilometers. Engineering vehicles have passed Yanggao and can reach Wangguanrentun. Including: (1) Between Pingzhang: Two pairs of ordinary passenger trains daily, and one pair of mixed trains departing from the West Station. (2) Between Beijing and Nankou: There is one pair of mixed trains daily.
 
　　3. Pinghan Line: Transport vehicles can reach Gaobeidian. Including: (1) Between Beijing and Zhuoxian: Three pairs of ordinary passenger trains daily (departing at 6:50, 8:24, and 10:10 daily, reaching in 3 hours). (2) Between Beijing and Changxindian: One pair of ordinary passenger trains daily.
 
　　4. Jinpu Line: Passenger trains reach Jinghai (47.7 kilometers), and engineering vehicles can reach Dongguang (180.6 kilometers). There is one pair of mixed trains daily between Jinjing. The original pair of ordinary passenger trains has been temporarily suspended due to construction.
 
　　5. Pinggu Line: (1) Beijing to Miyun (88.9 kilometers), one pair of mixed trains daily. (2) Between Beijing and Shunyi, one pair of mixed trains daily.
 
　　In addition to the above five major trunk lines, there are also the Pingmen, Pingtong, Nanyuan, Xigu, and Tanggu branch lines, as well as the ring line. The western suburbs can reach Xizhimen. All lines are open to traffic.
 
　　In addition, starting from April 15th, the Bureau will comprehensively implement the crew responsibility system (i.e., contract crew system), abolishing the old "big wheel crew system." All sections of each line will complete all preparations for the crew responsibility system before April 15th. This crew responsibility system involves a fixed number of crew members being assigned to a specific locomotive, and they are responsible for the entire locomotive's maintenance, driving, cleaning, and simple repairs. This crew responsibility system has been widely implemented in Northeast China and has achieved remarkable results: it not only improves the political awareness and technical level of the workers, but also increases the crew's sense of responsibility, care, and creativity towards the locomotive, enhances the locomotive's traction and work efficiency, thereby greatly improving the overall transportation capacity.

　　平津铁路各干线通车  军运货运日达三万吨
    各线决定全面推行乘务负责制
    【本报讯】平津铁路管理局所辖各线，在职工努力赶修下，已大部通车，一天上下乘车旅客平均约七万人，最高达八万人以上。该局军运货运每天计达三万余吨，通车里数共为九百七十一点七公里。兹将平津、平绥、平汉、津浦、平古各线通车情况志次：
    一、北宁线：北平至山海关，共四百三十二点五公里，其中包括：（一）平津间（一百三十九点四公里）每天特快车三对（行车时间需三小时五分）每天八时、十三时、十八时平津对开，此外尚有普快车两对，并由西站发混合一对。（二）平榆间：每天普快车一对（行车时间，因错车故，需十二小时余），混合车一对。（三）津榆间：每天普快车一对。（四）津唐间：每天混合车一对。
    二、平绥线：北平至张家口，交通车可到永嘉堡，共二百七十五点九公里，工程车已过阳高，可达王官人屯。其中包括：（一）平张间：每天普客两对，并自西站发混合车一对。（二）北平南口间：每天有混合车一对。
    三、平汉线：交通车可到高碑店。其中包括：（一）北平涿县间：每天普客三对（每天六时五十分，八时二十四分，十时十分，三小时可达）。（二）北平长辛店间：每天普客一对。
    四、津浦线：客车达静海（四十七点七公里），工程车可到东光（一八零点六公里），津静间每天混合车一对，原有之普客车一对，因工程暂停。
    五、平古线：（一）北平至密云（八十八点九公里），每天混合车一对。（二）北平顺义间，每天混合车一对。
    除上列五大干线外，尚有平门、平通、南苑、西沽、塘沽各支线以及环城线，西郊可至西直门。全部通车。
    又讯：该局自四月十五日起全面推行乘务负责制（即包乘制），一律废除旧有的大轮乘制。各路各段在四月十五日前完成乘务负责制的一切准备工作，这种乘务负责制度是由一定数量的乘务员，固定使用一台机车，由他们负责全部机车的保管、驾驶、清扫及简单修理等工作。这种乘务负责制在东北已普遍推行，得到了显著的成绩：它不但提高了职工的政治觉悟和技术水平，而且增加了乘务员对于机车的责任心，爱护心和高度的创造性，增强机车的牵引力和工作效率，整个运输力因而大大提高。
