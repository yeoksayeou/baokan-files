　　【Taihang Dispatch】 As Qingming Festival approaches, it is the season for planting trees and afforestation. Various special districts and counties in Taihang have successively issued calls, and some have organized special forces to specifically lead this work. The tree planting and afforestation movement is initially unfolding throughout the region. Linxian, in its call to launch a tree planting and forest protection movement, pointed out that after the end of land reform, farmers have the idea of long-term production, construction, and prosperity, so tree planting and forest protection has become a common demand of the masses. It called on the entire county to launch a campaign to plant one million trees before Qingming Festival. The Xingtai Production Committee called on everyone to plant a "Victory Tree" and pointed out that this is a century-long plan for production and prosperity, and the masses should be mobilized to carry it out well. In order to strengthen the protection of forests, the Fifth Special Administrative Office pointed out that in the past, due to a purely task-oriented viewpoint, only planting trees without protection resulted in a phenomenon of planting trees every year without seeing forests in some places. In order to ensure the success of tree planting, it specifically instructed that mass forest protection and management work must be carried out.
　　【Taihang Dispatch】 The Xingtai Agriculture and Forestry Bureau, in order to specifically guide and promote the masses to carry out spring tree planting, has sent two teams to Shahe and Xingtai to provide tree planting guidance.
　　After the Xingtai team arrived in the villages along the Baima River, the tree planting movement in each village developed rapidly through publicity and education. In Xishawo Village, all 151 households were organized, and there were 241 male and female laborers participating in tree planting, planting a total of 1,651 trees in half a day. Dongshawo Village organized 123 people, men and women working together, and planted a total of 15,000 trees in two days. In order to ensure the survival of the planted trees, the masses in each village also stipulated management covenants and protection disciplines.
　　【Jizhong Dispatch】 In order to realize the plan of planting 2.6 million trees in the spring afforestation campaign, the Jizhong Administrative Office has organized an afforestation team of 30 people, divided into three teams, to go to the counties with sandy wasteland in the 9th, 10th, and 11th Special Districts respectively. In conjunction with the local party and government leading organs and farms, they will mobilize and organize farmers to carry out tree planting and afforestation activities; and inspect the survival rate of trees planted last year. According to the unified deployment of the North China Afforestation Bureau, it is planned to build windbreak belts in the wasteland areas such as the Shahe Shendao beach and Mudao ditch in Wuji, Xinle and other counties. In the newly liberated areas of the Tenth Special District, the afforestation work was very poor in the past, so for the time being, only certain areas in the sandy areas along the Yongding River on both sides of Yongqing, Gu'an, Wanping, and Anci will be selected for key afforestation, and the sandy wasteland situation will be investigated and understood in preparation for a comprehensive launch next year. In the Eleventh Special District, in the old course of the Hutuo River in Jin County, Shulu and other counties, farmers are mobilized to plant a large number of windbreak forests, striving to complete the afforestation task before the Qingming Festival, and then go to various farms to help with seedling cultivation work.

　　清明节将到
  　太行加紧植树护林
    冀中派出造林队建造防风林带
    【太行电】清明将至，正是植树造林季节。太行各专县已先后发出号召，有的并组织专门力量，具体领导这一工作，植树造林运动在全区范围内初步展开。林县在开展植树护林运动的号召中指出，结束土改后，农民有了长期生产建设发家致富的思想，因而植树护林已成为当前群众的普遍要求。号召全县在清明节前开展植百万棵树的运动。邢台生产委员会号召：每人栽活一棵“胜利树”，并指出这是生产致富的百年大计，应很好发动群众进行。五专署为加强对林木的保护，指出已往由于单纯任务观点，光植树不保护，某些地方形成年年栽树不见林的现象。为了保证植树成功，特指示必须开展群众性的护林管理工作。
    【太行电】邢台农林局为具体指导与推动群众进行春季植树，特派两个小组，分赴沙河邢台进行植树指导。
    邢台小组到达白马河沿岸各村后，经过宣传教育，各村的植树运动迅速开展。西沙窝村全村一百五十一户，组织起来参加植树的男女劳力即有二百四十一个，半天时间共植树一千六百五十一棵。东沙窝村组织起来一百二十三人，男女一齐动手，两天时间共栽树一万五千棵。为了保证植树成活，各村群众并规定了管理公约与保护纪律。
    【冀中电】为实现春季植树造林二百六十万株的计划，冀中行署特组织造林队，共三十人，分别组成三队，分赴九、十、十一专区各个有沙荒的县份，结合当地党政领导机关和农场，发动与组织农民开展植树造林运动；并检查去年栽树的成活程度。根据华北造林局的统一布置，计划在无极、新乐等县沙河神道滩、木刀沟等荒地区建造防风林带。十专区新解放地区，过去造林工作很差，故暂时只在永清、固安、宛平、安次、永定河两岸的沙区选择一定地区重点造林，并调查了解沙荒情况，准备明年全面开展。十一专区在晋县、束鹿等县滹沱河故道，发动农民大量栽造防风林，争取在清明节以前完成造林任务，然后到各农场帮助育苗工作。
