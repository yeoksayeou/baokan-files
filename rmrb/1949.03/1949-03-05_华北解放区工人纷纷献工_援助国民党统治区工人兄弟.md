Workers in North China Liberated Areas Actively Donate Work
    To Help Worker Brothers in Kuomintang-Controlled Areas

    [Reported by this newspaper] Workers in state-owned factories in the North China Liberated Areas have launched a warm "donate work" movement to help worker brothers in Kuomintang-controlled areas who are suffering from hunger and cold. At the "February 7th" Congress held on the 11th of last month by the General Trade Union of the Gebei Mining Area in Lingshan Town, Quyang County, Chahar Province, and all staff and workers of the mining area, after Sun Yuhui, an old worker representative of the Sixth Labor Congress who had just returned from Harbin, conveyed the resolutions and spirit of the Labor Congress, and spoke about the suffering of worker brothers in the Kuomintang-controlled areas, who were unable to get enough to eat and were brutally murdered under the rule of the reactionaries, the workers below the stage burst into tears. Worker Xiao Zhang shouted loudly: "Comrades, we must not forget the worker brothers in the Kuomintang-controlled areas who are still being oppressed, freezing and starving. We must help them so that they can achieve liberation as soon as possible!" At this time, the presidium proposed: "Donate one day of voluntary labor to help worker brothers in the Kuomintang-controlled areas." Hundreds of workers' hands were raised in unison, and this proposal was passed. They also proposed to actively support the front line with practical actions to increase production in order to liberate all of China as soon as possible! In addition, workers at the farm implement factories in the Ninth Special District of Central Hebei also launched a processing movement to support the workers' movement in the Kuomintang-controlled areas. Workers in each factory increased production time according to the specific situation, with an average increase of more than one day of voluntary work per person. All workers in the three factories donated 41,870 yuan (People's Currency) in wages, which has been entirely sent to the Central Hebei General Trade Union as a fund to support the workers' movement in the Kuomintang-controlled areas. Workers at the Shigijie Liberated Coal Mine in Taihang also actively launched donations. A total of 1,322 staff and workers participated throughout the mine, donating a total of 43,747 yuan in People's Currency, which has been handed over to the General Trade Union for transfer.
