The attendees included Cai Chang, Director of the Preparatory Committee, Vice Directors Deng Yingchao and Li Dequan, Secretary-General Zhang Qinqiu, Sun Wenshu, Luo Shuzhang, Zeng Xianzhi, and others, totaling sixty people. This was the largest gathering during the preparatory period. Chairman Cai Chang announced the significance of the meeting and the meeting agenda. Next, Deng Yingchao reported on the progress of the conference preparations, recounting the various tasks since the establishment of the preparatory committee. Currently, three reports, "The Guiding Principles and Tasks of the Chinese Women's Movement," "The Democratic Women's Movement in the Kuomintang-controlled Areas," and "The International Democratic Women's Movement," have been drafted, as well as important documents such as the "Draft Resolution on the Current Tasks of the Chinese Women's Movement" and the "Draft Constitution of the All-China Women's Federation." Vice Director Deng also emphasized calling on all preparatory committee members to consult with each other on issues, help and understand each other, concentrate their efforts, and welcome the upcoming First National Congress of Chinese Women. Subsequently, Secretary-General Zhang Qinqiu informed the meeting of the current state of preparations. To date, 383 representatives have registered, over 1,000 photos and over 1,000 physical objects have been received for the exhibition, 71 congratulatory banners have been received from various regions, and 20 types of gifts, fully demonstrating the enthusiastic support of women from various regions for the conference. All male and female comrades participating in the preparatory work are working day and night to actively carry out preparations. Finally, Vice Director Li Dequan reported on the number of representatives from the Kuomintang-controlled areas and how they were selected. A lively discussion then unfolded in the venue, and the following matters were decided: (1) In order to ensure that the National Women's Congress can include representatives from all fields, it was decided to invite female cadres of the People's Liberation Army on the Pingjin front, and representatives from the national literary, theatrical, and musical circles to participate, and approved requests from individual regions to increase the number of representatives, thereby increasing the number of representatives by 25, and authorizing the Standing Committee to specifically allocate them. (2) Under possible conditions, relevant women comrades from all fields will be invited to participate in the audience, and the number and distribution method will be fully handled by the Secretariat. (3) Organize an important document review committee and a constitution draft review committee to review various documents. The personnel will be jointly organized by one or two comrades from each delegation and the original drafters. Finally, Comrade Yang Zhihua proposed issuing a declaration in response to the upcoming World Congress for the Defense of Peace, and representatives will be elected by the First National Congress of Chinese Women to attend, which was unanimously approved by all members of the preparatory committee.
    [This Newspaper's Report] The First National Congress of Chinese Women is about to open, and women representatives from all over the country are gathering in Beiping. As of yesterday (the 19th), 383 representatives from various regions have registered, including women representatives from the five major liberated areas of Northwest, East China, Northeast, Central Plains, and North China, as well as the Kuomintang-controlled areas and overseas Chinese. According to preliminary statistics of the registered representatives from the four major liberated areas of Northwest, East China, Northeast, and Central Plains: there are 24 female workers, 42 rural working women, and 113 intellectual women. Among them are hero models of production and support for the front lines, female cadres who have persisted in revolutionary struggles for a long time, intellectual models who have gone deep into the workers and peasants to serve the workers and peasants, female soldiers working in the army, and female workers and professional women and female students in various work positions. These representatives were carefully and earnestly elected through women's congresses in various liberated areas (such as Northeast, East China, and Central Plains) or divisional women's congresses in various liberated areas (such as Northwest and North China). Representatives attending women's congresses in various liberated areas or divisions were elected by women's congresses of cities, counties, or organizations above the county level. The emergence of each representative was preceded by detailed introductions and heated discussions, and then elected by direct, secret ballot. For example, when female workers in Shenyang discussed the qualifications of candidates, they proposed: "They must have a clean history, not those who used to ride on the heads of workers"; "They must be active in production and fair in their work." Rural women also similarly elected those who were good at labor and could lead their own production as representatives. Many places conducted heated elections. The election itself became a very good education for the broad masses of women.

    【本报讯】中国妇女第一次全国代表大会即将揭幕，各地妇女代表群聚北平，迄昨（十九）日止，各地报到代表已达三百八十三名，包括西北、华东、东北、中原、华北五大解放区及国统区与海外华侨等妇女代表。据西北、华东、东北、中原四大解放区已报到的代表的初步统计：计有女工二十四名，农村劳动妇女四十二名，知识妇女一一三名。其中有生产，支援前线的英雄模范，有长期坚持革命斗争的妇女干部，有知识分子深入工农群众为工农服务的模范，有在军队中工作的女战士，有各个工作岗位上的女工作者和职业妇女、女学生。这些代表都是经过各解放区妇女代表大会（如东北、华东、中原）或各解放区的分区妇女代表大会（如西北、华北）慎重、认真地选举出来的。出席各解放区或各分区妇女代表大会的代表，则经各市、县或县级以上的机关团体的妇女代表大会所选出。每个代表的产生都是先经过详细介绍和热烈的讨论，然后以直接的不记名的票选法选举。例如沈阳女工们讨论候选人条件时，就提出：要“历史清白的，不要那些过去骑在工人头上的人”；“要生产积极，做事公平的”。农村妇女也同样的选举劳动好的，能领导自己生产的为代表。许多地方都进行了热烈的竞选。选举本身就成为对广大妇女的一个很好的教育。
