　　The Working Class of Beiping
    A New Attitude Towards Labor
    Breaking Old Habits
    Processing and Unloading

    The workers of the Shijingshan Power Plant, in order to quickly sort out the materials scattered outside the warehouse, spent their days drilling through piles of iron. Their hands were worn red, but they did not complain at all. On the afternoon of the 14th, a little after 5 o'clock, the workers were busy sorting iron when a material truck arrived from the branch company, loaded with materials. "Unload the truck, it's almost time!" the escort shouted. According to past practice, no matter how you shouted, people would leave when the time came, because everyone was afraid of having to work overtime if they finished early. But now it was different. Without the section chief giving an order, the workers automatically ran out quickly. The office was bustling. The clock was still ten minutes away from the whistle. "Let's do it, unload it quickly!" the workers said automatically. Zhang Jintang and others were sweating profusely, some carrying, some lifting, loading materials, writing material tags, weighing, measuring dimensions... Everyone was mobilized. In an instant, the entire truckload of materials was brought into the office. The workers' faces turned black, and they didn't leave work until all the materials were sorted out.

    Even Small Screws are Picked Up

    During the Kuomintang era, all kinds of American-made motors and equipment in the communications equipment warehouse were thrown haphazardly into the warehouse, exposed to moisture and rust, becoming waste products. No one ever inspected or repaired them. After the takeover, the workers, after being educated, realized that the things belonged to them. Many pieces of equipment were automatically inspected, sorted, and boxed, making everything neat and tidy. Even a small screw that fell on the ground was picked up.

    Rain and Snow Cannot Stop Work

    Rain and snow came down in a mix. At the 41st Army Ordnance Repair Shop, there was no building for repairing cannons, and the workers were all working in the courtyard. Their clothes were soaked, but no one avoided it, and they continued to work as usual. Comrade Qi Zhengjia got hot from working and took off his cotton coat, working in a single layer, with steam constantly rising from his body. The hands of Comrade Su Lian, and the feet of Comrade Han Maotang, were injured by the machines, but they did not stop working.

　　北平工人阶级
    新的劳动态度
    打破旧习惯
    加工卸车
    石景山发电厂的工人们为了很快把散在库外的材料整理好，整日在铁堆里钻。手都给磨红了，而没有丝毫怨言。十四日下午五点多钟，工人们正在忙于整理铁料，适由分公司开来材料车，上面装满材料。“卸车吧，快到点了！”押运人喊着。按以往的惯例，无论你怎么喊，反正到点就走，因为大家怕早干完了要加班。可是现在不同了，不等股长下命令，工人们就自动的很快的跑出来。办公室里忙碌了。钟表还差十分钟拉笛。“干吧，快点搬卸！”工友们自动说。张金堂等累的满头是汗，搬的搬，背的背，上料、写料牌、过磅、量尺寸，……全体总动员，一刹那间，满车材料都进了办公室。工友们的脸变成了黑底锅，直到把材料清理完才下班。

    小小螺丝钉也被拣回来
    通信器材库在国民党时代，各种美式电机、器材都乱抛在库房里，受潮生锈，成了废品，从来没人检查修理。接管以后，工人们经过教育，认识到东西是自己的了，许多器材都自动经过检查、整理、装了箱，闹得整整齐齐，就是一个小螺丝钉掉在地上，也被拣了回来。

    雨雪交加挡不住工作
    雨雪交加的降下来了，四十一军修械所，修炮没有屋子，工人们都在院子里工作。他们的衣服被淋湿了，但没有一个人躲避，仍旧照常工作。祁正家同志工作得热了，把棉衣脱掉，穿着单衣干，热气从身上不断的冒出来。苏联升同志的手，韩茂堂同志的脚，都被机器打坏了，都不停止工作。
