　　Workers' Lives are Guaranteed
　　No Need to Return Home to Divide Land
　　Question: We are workers from the Second Sewing Department of the Beiping Clothing Factory, and our original homes are in the countryside, also in the liberated areas. Some of us have received letters from our families asking us to return home to divide the land. If we don't return before the Qingming Festival, there will be no land for us. Our families originally had less than twenty-five mu of land, and there are three people in the family. The whole village has five mu of land per person, so if we don't return home, we can only divide fifteen mu. Some of us want to return home to divide some land because our families have little land. However, if we ask for leave, we cannot work in the factory, and the administrator will not approve the leave. We are in a dilemma. Since we are serving the country, the country should naturally use reasonable methods to protect us. If we should also be allocated land, the higher authorities should also think of a way for us. We look forward to your answer!

　　Answer: Workers do not participate in agricultural labor, but rely on wage income as their entire or main source of livelihood, so they do not need and should not be allocated land. However, the small pieces of land originally occupied by workers' families in the countryside will not be touched. As mentioned in the letter, the fear that only fifteen mu of land can be divided if one does not return home is actually the fear of further land being taken away. This concern is unnecessary. As long as your family is not a landlord or rich peasant, whether you return or not, the original land will not be touched, and you should work in the factory with peace of mind. Perhaps some workers will feel that: land reform is to enable the poor to turn over, farmers can divide the land, workers are proletarians, shouldn't they be able to divide the land? If you think this way, then it is wrong. Land reform is to eliminate the feudal and feudal-exploitative land system, so that landless and land-poor peasants can obtain the means of production, and improve agricultural technology to develop agricultural production, laying the foundation for China's industrialization. The improvement of agricultural technology must rely on the rapid recovery and development of industrial production to supply rural areas with production tools and various industrial products. If the workers all ask to return home to divide the land at this time, as the letter says, they will not be able to work in the factory if they return, then who will shoulder the huge industrial production tasks? Therefore, in fact, this is a backward petty-bourgeois idea that hinders the development of industry and commerce, and is not what an advanced proletariat should have. At the same time, in the liberated areas, workers' lives have not only been fully guaranteed, but will also be improved day by day with the development of production and construction, so there is really no need to return home to divide a few more mu of land.

　　However, some workers may have specific difficulties in proposing to divide the land, such as some families living in the countryside with a large population, and the wages of the worker alone are not enough to maintain their lives. Naturally, they can, according to the specific situation, consult with the local peasant association and give their families a certain amount of land. The individual himself has wage income to maintain his life, so there is no need to divide the land again. If you have any other questions, please raise them for discussion.

### 工人生活有保障　勿须回家分土地

　　工人生活有保障
    勿须回家分土地
    问：我们是北平被服厂第二缝纫部的工人，原籍是乡里，也是解放区。我们有个人家里给他来了信，叫他回家分地，在清明节前如不回家，就没有地了。他家原有地不足二十五亩，家里有三口人，全村每人合五亩地，要不回家，就只能分十五亩。我们有的人是想回家分点地，因为家里地少。可是要请假，就不能在厂工作了，管理员也不准假。我们进退两难。我们既在国家服务，国家当然要用合理方法保障我们的。如果我们也应该分地，上级当然也要替我们想办法。请劳神解答为盼！
    　　　　　　　　　第二缝纫部的十六名工人
    答：工人不参加农业劳动，而是依靠工资收入作为全部或主要生活来源，所以不需要也不应该分得土地，但工人家在农村原来占有的小块土地，则不予抽动。如来信中所说，怕不回家只能分十五亩地，实际上是怕再抽出土地，这顾虑是不必要的，只要你家庭不是地主或富农，你回不回去，原来土地都不抽动，应该在厂安心工作。也许有一部份工友会觉得：土地改革要使穷人翻身，农民可以分土地，工人是无产阶级，给道还不能分地吗？假如这样想，那就不对了。土地改革是要消灭封建性和被封建性剥削的土地制度，使无地少地的贫苦农民获得生产手段，并改进农业技术发展农业生产，为中国的工业化奠定基础。而农业技术的改进，又一定得依靠工业生产的迅速恢复与发展，以供给农村生产工具与各种工业品。这时候工友们都要求回家分土地，正如来信所说，回去了就不能在厂工作，那么巨大的工业生产任务将由谁担负呢？所以，实际上这是一种有碍工商业发展的落后的小农思想，不是先进的无产阶级所应有的。同时，在解放区工人生活不但已获得充分保证，并将随着生产建设事业的发展而日益改善，实在也没有回家再分几亩地的必要。
    但有些工友们提出要分土地，也许有其具体困难，比如有的家在农村，家庭人口很多，靠本人工资不足维持生活的，自然可以根据具体情况，商得当地农会同意，酌量分给其家属土地。其本人，有工资收入可以维持生活，即无须再分土地。不知大家还有什么疑问，望再提出讨论。
