    Communist Party of Great Britain – The Communist Party of Great Britain was founded in 1912, a union of many small Marxist groups. The current General Secretary is Pollitt. Before World War II, it had 18,000 members, which increased to 60,000 in 1948. It has two members in the House of Commons, Gallagher and Piratin. The prestige of the Communist Party of Great Britain is increasing daily among the British working class, causing workers influenced by the right-wing elements of the Labour Party to gradually lean towards the Communist Party. In December 1947, the right-wing leaders of the Labour Party launched an "anti-communist crusade," vainly attempting to use the opportunity of trade union re-elections to exclude communists from various trade union organizations. However, the result of the re-election was the opposite of the wishful thinking of the Labour Party's right-wing elements. The Communist Party gained important positions in many important trade union organizations. According to estimates at the time, more than 1.5 million organized workers were directly under the leadership of the British Communist Party.
    Gestapo – A type of special agent organization, created by the Nazi German bandit leader Hitler and his secret police chief Himmler before World War II. It was then called the "secret police," scattered at home and abroad, specializing in cruel assassinations, kidnappings, and assaults as a means to create extreme terror. Chiang Kai-shek's use of special agent tactics was learned from Himmler.
    Choibalsan – The current Premier of the Mongolian People's Republic and one of the leaders of the Mongolian Communist Party. In 1924, after the Mongolian people, under the leadership of the Mongolian Communist Party, overthrew the feudal system and established a democratic regime, he became the Chairman of the Mongolian People's Republic. He led the people in building their own country, and the original vast grasslands were gradually developed into large farms using machines; and modern industry began to emerge, with railways, airplanes, generators, and radios. In January 1948, he formulated the first five-year plan for the Mongolian People's Republic, aiming to gradually make Mongolia a modern, prosperous, and happy country.
    Mexico – Located in the southern part of North America. It borders the United States to the north and northeast; the Gulf of Mexico to the east; Guatemala to the southeast; and the Pacific Ocean from the south to the northwest. It covers an area of approximately 1.97 million square kilometers, with a population of over 19 million. Agriculture is very developed, with the main products being maize, wheat, and cotton. Mexico's silver mines are world-renowned, and coal production is also abundant. The production of antimony, lead, mercury (quicksilver), gold, and oil is also considerable. However, Mexico's heavy industry is not developed. Every year, a large amount of mineral products are exported to the United States to become industrial raw materials for the United States, and then a large number of manufactured products are imported from the United States. In recent years, the Mexican government has paid attention to the development of industrial construction, especially the refining of oil. However, they have not completely broken away from their dependence on the United States. Mexico has a long coastline, holding the throat of the Pacific Ocean and the Gulf of Mexico, which has long been coveted by American imperialism. Now, American imperialism has openly put forward the demand for military bases. The Mexican people, the Mexican Communist Party (which had 25,000 members at the end of 1947), and other democrats will rise up and resist this aggression.

    英国共产党——英国共产党成立于一九一二年，是许多马克思主义的小团体联合起来的。现在的总书记是波立特。第二次世界大战前有党员一万八千人，一九四八年增至六万人。在国会下院中有两名议员，即加拉赫与皮拉丁。英共在英国工人阶级中，威信日益增加，使受着工党右翼分子影响下的工人逐渐倾向了共产党，一九四七年十二月工党右翼首领发起“反共十字军”运动，妄想借工会改选的机会从各工会组织中排斥共产党人，但改选的结果恰与工党右翼分子的妄想相反，共产党在许多重要工会组织中获得了重要的地位，据当时估计，直接在英共领导下的有组织的工人有一百五十万以上。
    盖斯特波——一种特务组织，首创人是第二次世界大战以前纳粹德国的匪首希特勒及其秘密警察厅长希姆莱，当时被称为“秘密警察”，散布在国内外，专以残酷的暗杀、绑架、打人为手段，造成极端的恐怖。蒋介石用特务的手法就是跟希姆莱学的。
    却伊巴桑——是现任蒙古人民共和国总理。蒙古共产党领袖之一。一九二四年蒙古人民在蒙共领导下推翻了封建制度，建立了民主政权以后，他即出任蒙古人民共和国的主席。他领导着人民建设自己的国家，原来的大草原，渐渐的开辟成使用机器的大农场；并且开始有了现代化的工业，有了铁路、飞机、发电机、无线电。一九四八年一月，他制定了蒙古人民共和国的第一个五年计划，要使蒙古逐渐成为一个现代化的富强康乐的国家。
    墨西哥——在北美洲的南部。北、东北接连美国；东濒墨西哥海湾；东南邻危地马拉；南到西北均滨太平洋。面积约一百九十七万方公里，人口一千九百多万。农业很发达，主要产品为玉蜀黍、小麦及棉花；墨西哥之银矿闻名世界，煤产亦丰富，锑、铅、汞（水银）、金、石油等产量也很可观。但是墨西哥国家，重工业并不发达，每年把大量的矿产都输出到美国，成为美国的工业原料，然后又从美国输进大量制成品。这几年来，墨西哥政府虽然已经注意到发展工业建设，尤其是石油的开炼，但是，他们并没有完全脱离对美国的依赖。墨西哥海岸线很长，扼着太平洋与墨西哥湾的咽喉，早为美国帝国主义所觊觎，现在美帝国主义公然提出军事根据地的要求了，墨西哥人民、墨西哥共产党（一九四七年底有党员二万五千人）及其他民主分子，是会起而反抗这种侵略的。
