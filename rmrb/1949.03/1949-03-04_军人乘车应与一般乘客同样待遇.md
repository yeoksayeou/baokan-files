Criticism and Suggestions

　　Soldiers Should Receive the Same Treatment as Regular Passengers When Traveling
　　Editor:
    Regarding the frequent disputes between comrades in the army and comrades in the railway bureau, in addition to agreeing with what was published in the Criticism and Suggestions column of your newspaper on January 20th, that comrades in the army should pay attention to complying with the railway bureau's travel regulations, I have one more suggestion for the railway bureau's reference. That is, general passengers all sit in the pre-war third-class carriages, which have lights and stoves, and are relatively comfortable; while soldiers are assigned separate iron-doored carriages, which have neither lights nor stoves. The weather is so cold, and of course the comrades in the army will have opinions if they are made to sit in them. I think this is unreasonable. I wonder if the comrades in the railway bureau treat soldiers differently because they pay half price? If so, the vast majority of army comrades traveling back and forth on the railway lines are busy with frontline work and should enjoy the same treatment as general passengers. Therefore, I suggest that, except in special circumstances, don't set up special iron-doored carriages for soldiers anymore. Please consider whether this is appropriate.

### 军人乘车应与一般乘客同样待遇

专栏：批评与建议

　　军人乘车应与一般乘客同样待遇编者同志：
    关于部队同志常和铁路局同志发生争执问题，除同意一月二十日贵报批评与建议栏所载，部队同志应注意遵守铁路局乘车规定外，尚有一点建议，供铁路局参考。即一般乘客都是坐着抗战前的三等客车，里面有灯也有火，比较舒适；而军人则另设铁门子车，里面既没有灯又没有火，天气这样冷，让部队同志坐进去，当然会有意见。我觉得这样不够合理，不知铁路局同志是否因为军人打半票，就应该另眼看待？如果这样，往返于铁路线上的部队同志，绝大部份都是忙于前线工作的，更应该享受与一般乘客相等的待遇。因此建议除特殊情况外，不要再给军人专设铁门子车。是否恰当，请考虑。　　　　一兵团司令部通讯科　韩黎
