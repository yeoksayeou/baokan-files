Transportation and telecommunications in the Taihang Mountain area were very underdeveloped in the past. Before the War of Resistance, feudal rule prevented the construction of many roads that could have been built, hindering the exchange of goods across natural landscapes like the Zhang River. During the War of Resistance, the Japanese blockade severely hampered transportation. After the Japanese surrendered in 1945, the liberated areas were largely connected, and with the completion of land reform, industrial and agricultural production rapidly developed. The broad masses urgently demanded the development of transportation. Over the past three years, under the leadership of the democratic government, arduous transportation construction has been carried out, breaking through the natural barriers of the Taihang Mountains and the Zhang and Qin Rivers, allowing smooth transportation between the mountains and the plains. This has played a significant role in supporting the People's Liberation War and facilitating the exchange of goods between the mountains and the plains.

In terms of the restoration and construction of highways, since the liberation of Jinzhong and northern Henan in the summer of 1948, a total of 3,955 li of main and branch lines have been repaired. The four major arteries within the region—the Baijin Line (from Taigu to Jiaozuo, 760 li long in total, with 200 li under the jurisdiction of Taiyue), the Hanzhang Line (from Handan to Changzhi, 350 li long), the Pinghan Line (the section from Shijiazhuang to Xinxiang, 1,000 li long, with 100 li under the jurisdiction of the Jinnan District), and the Daoqing Line (the section from Qinyang to Ji County, 300 li)—totaling more than 2,100 li, are now open to traffic and connected. Changzhi City is the highway center of the western Taihang area, while Qinyang is the center of the southern line. In addition to the Daoqing Highway, three branch lines directly reaching the north bank of the Yellow River have been built: one from Qinyang via Meng County to Baipo Ferry; one from Qinyang via Wen County connecting with Sishui Estuary on the south bank of the Yellow River; and one from Xiuwu Muluandian Xiaojizhen (under Xinxiang) directly to Laotian'an Ferry on the north bank of the Yellow River. The eastern line has the Pinghan Road running directly north and south. Besides these main lines, 15 highways connecting various counties in the interior have been repaired, including Shuihui (from Shuiye Town in Anyang via Lin County to Huixian), Pingliao (from Pindin via Heshun to Liaoxian), Lingjin (from Lingchuan to Jincheng), Lingchang (from Lingchuan to Changzhi), Linggao (from Lingchuan to Gaoping), and Xingguan (from Xingtai via Wu'an, Cixian Pengcheng Town to Guantai Town in Anyang), totaling 1,835 li. The masses in various places showed great enthusiasm in repairing the highways. When repairing the Qihe Bridge in Qixian, northern Henan, the masses transported wood and stones in the nearly freezing water, completing the project in two days instead of the planned four. In terms of transportation, in addition to many rubber-wheeled horse carts owned by the masses in various places, the Changzhi Jinfeng Automobile Company has four heavy-duty gasoline trucks and 24 charcoal trucks. Starting from Changzhi, an average of five charcoal trucks per day travel to Jincheng and Xiangyuan, each carrying 3,500 jin of goods. Gasoline trucks frequently travel to Taigu, Jiaozuo, and Shexian, with each truck carrying an average of 5,000 jin per day. This has greatly changed the obstructed state of natural transportation in the mountains.

In terms of railways, the Handan-Shexian light railway (from Handan in the east to Shexian in the west), with a total length of 200 li, was built. Construction of the railway began at the end of 1946, and after more than two years of effort, including opening mountains and building bridges, the entire line was opened to traffic at the end of last autumn after extremely arduous work. This railway is of great significance for connecting the exchange of goods between the mountains and the plains. It can now transport more than 200 tons of goods per day.

In addition to railways and highways, several new cart roads have been built. This is also a great achievement of the people of the Taihang area. The first is from Wangyang to Zanhuang, 200 li long; the second is from Xingtai to Heshun, 180 li; the third is from Lingchuan to Huixian, 320 li; and the fourth is from Huguan to Linxian Herun, 180 li. All four roads are important routes from the Taihang Mountains eastward to the plains, all involving arduous mountain excavation. In addition, new cart roads built in the Taihang Mountains include the 80-li road from Shexian to Xijing Town in Licheng, and the 250-li road from Zuoquan via Yushe, Wuxiang, and Xiangyuan to Changzhi. These cart roads have increased the convenience of urban-rural connections and reduced the enormous costs of transportation in the mountains.

Significant progress has also been made in the construction of postal services. Since the slogan of enterprise management was put forward at the beginning of 1947, it has gradually become standardized. According to statistics from February of this year, the entire area has 40 county and city post offices, 10 simple branch offices, 4 postal stations, and 246 agency offices and sales points, scattered throughout the large and small towns of the area. Since the widespread development of rural postal services in 1947, postal work has penetrated from the towns to all remote rural areas in the region, with more than 800 rural post offices and postal points. According to summer statistics of 1948, the total length of postal main and branch lines and county and district main lines in the region was 22,935 li, and the length of rural postal lines was 43,393 li. There are 306 postal workers and 430 postal laborers. The development of rural postal services has further linked postal work with the broad masses of peasants. This is the case in the liberated areas, and our postal work is also very active in areas occupied by the Chiang bandits. For example, when Xiuwu and Jiaozuo were occupied by the Chiang bandits in 1947, postal workers braved wind and rain to cross enemy blockade lines and established many secret postal offices behind enemy lines, delivering continuous news of the People's Liberation Army's victories at the front and letters and newspapers from the liberated areas to military families and the broad masses behind enemy lines. In addition, mobile post offices were established in our army units, making postal work serve the soldiers. The rapid mutual dissemination of news of victories in various liberated areas and news of the people in the rear working hard to support the front was achieved. In particular, the exchange of letters between the People's Liberation Army and military families directly encouraged the soldiers at the front and comforted the military families. With the liberation of major cities and the recovery and development of transportation and industry and commerce, postal services have also greatly developed. On average, each post office in the region handles more than 448,000 forwarded mail items (including registered mail) per month; more than 1,600 jin of parcels; and more than 37 million yuan (People's Bank notes) in remittances. At present, Taihang postal services can exchange ordinary mail with all liberated areas north of the Yangtze River, and registered letters can be exchanged with the three major liberated areas of Northeast, Northwest, and East China. Remittance and parcel services had already been restored in the North China liberated area. Last December, official remittance services were established on February 25, 1949, with the post offices of various counties under East China and the cities of Jinan, Xuzhou, Dezhou, Yantai, Weifang, Xinhai, and Jining, as well as the cities of Tianjin, Beiping, and Zhangjiakou. In terms of postal tools, there has also been some improvement. On the main lines, except for some mountainous areas with inconvenient transportation where human labor is still used, most mail is transported by automobiles, trains, carts, or bicycles.

The telecommunications business was almost entirely built by ourselves. At present, party, government, military, and civilian organizations above the district level have all restored and established long-distance telephones, and some county and city organizations also have telephone equipment. Commercial telephones have also been constructed in Changzhi City and can be used to communicate with commercial telephones in Handan.

　　太行山区的交通邮电建设
    太行分社
    太行区的交通邮电事业，过去是很不发达的。抗战前，由于封建的统治，许多本可修通的道路则不能修通，使自然的山河（如漳河）阻碍了物资的交流。抗战中，由于日寇的封锁，交通也受到了极大障碍。一九四五年日寇投降后，解放区大片连接起来，又由于土地改革的完成，工农业生产迅速发展，广大群众迫切要求发展交通。三年来在民主政府领导下，进行了艰巨的交通建设，冲破了太行山与漳河、沁河等自然障碍，使山地与平原的交通得以畅通。对于支援人民解放战争以及山地与平原物资交流，起了重大作用。
    在公路的恢复与修建上，自一九四八年夏，晋中、豫北全境解放后，共修复干、支线三千九百五十五里。本区境内之白晋（太谷至焦作，全长七百六十华里，内有太岳管辖二百里）、邯长（邯郸至长治全长三百五十里）、平汉（石家庄至新乡段，全长一千里，内有冀南区辖一百里）、道清（沁阳至汲县段，三百里）等四大干线共长两千一百余里，现在都已通车，并且联接在一起。长治市是太行西线的公路中心，在南线则以沁阳为中心。除道清公路外，又修了三条直达黄河北岸的支线：一条从沁阳经孟县直达白坡渡口；一条从沁阳经温县与黄河南岸泗水口相结；一条从修武木栾店小冀镇（新乡属）直达黄河北岸老天岸渡口。东线则有平汉路直贯南北。除这些干线外，内地各县相联之公路已修复的有水辉（安阳水冶镇经林县至辉县）、平辽（平定经和顺至辽县）、陵晋（陵川至晋城）、陵长（陵川至长治）、陵高（陵川至高平）、邢观（邢台经武安、磁县彭城镇至安阳观台镇）等十五条，共长一千八百三十五华里。各地群众在修复公路中表现十分积极，在修复豫北淇县的淇河大桥时，群众在将要结冰的水中转运木石，原计划四天，但两天即完成。在运输上，除各地群众有不少胶皮轮马车外，长治晋丰汽车公司有载重汽油车四辆。木炭车二十四辆。以长治为起点，木灰车每日平均有五辆开往晋城与襄垣两地，每辆运货三千五百斤。汽油车则经常驰赴太谷、焦作、涉县三地。各路每日平均每辆可载重五千斤。由此大大改变了山地自然交通的阻塞面貌。
    铁路方面，建筑了邯涉轻便铁路（东起邯郸、西至涉县），全长二百华里。该路于一九四六年年底开始建筑，经二年余努力，开山、筑桥，经历了极艰巨的工程，已于去年秋末全线通车。该路对沟通山地与平原物资交流，有极大意义。现每日可运输物资二百余吨。
    除铁路、公路外，又新修建了几条马车路。这也是太行区人民的伟迹。第一条是旺阳至赞皇，长二百华里；第二条邢台至和顺，共一百八十里；第三条是陵川至辉县，长三百二十里；第四是壶关至林县合润，长一百八十里。四条路都是从太行山上向东通平原的重要道路，中间都经过了艰苦的凿山过程。其次，在太行山上新修通的马车路有涉县至黎城西井镇八十里，及左权经榆社、武乡、襄垣至长治共长二百五十余里。这些大车路均给城乡联系增加了便利，同时减少了山地过去在运输中的巨大耗费。
    在邮政事业的建设上，成绩也十分可观。自一九四七年初，提出企业化口号后，便逐渐走向正规。据今年二月份统计：全区有县市邮局四十个、十个简易支局、四个邮站、二百四十六个代办所与代售处，散布在全区大小城镇。自一九四七年普遍开展乡邮工作后，更使邮务工作从城镇深入到全区所有偏僻农村，现共有乡邮局与乡邮点八百余处。据一九四八年夏季统计：全区邮政干、支线及县区干线共长二万二千九百三十五华里，乡邮线四万三千三百九十三华里。共有邮务工作人员三百零六人，邮工四百三十人。乡邮的开展使邮政工作进一步与广大农民联系起来。这在解放区内地是如此，而在蒋匪占据的地方，我邮政工作也很活跃。如一九四七年修武、焦作被蒋匪占据时，邮务员工都不避风雨，越过敌人封锁线，在敌后建立了不少秘密邮务所，将解放军在前线连续不断的胜利消息和解放区的信件书报，转递到敌后军属和广大群众手中。并且在我军部队中，也成立了随军邮局，使邮务工作做到了为兵服务。对各解放区的胜利消息，和后方人民努力生产支援前线的各种消息，做到了迅速的相互传播。特别是解放军与军属之间互通信件，直接鼓舞了前线战士，和安慰了军属。随着各大城市的解放，交通及工商业的恢复发展、使邮政业务也有很大发展。全区所属邮局一般每月平均要办理转寄邮件（挂号在内）四十四万八千余件；包裹一千六百余斤；汇款三千七百余万元（人民票）。现太行邮政，对长江以北所有解放区普通邮件，皆可互通，与东北、西北、华东三大解放区，可通挂号信件。在办理汇兑、包裹方面，在华北解放区早已恢复。去年十二月又与华东所属各县邮局及济南、徐州、德州、烟台、潍坊、新海、济宁等市与天津、北平、张家口等城市，也于一九四九年二月二十五日正式通汇。在邮政工具方面，也较前有所改善。干线上除一部份交通不便的山区，尚以人力担挑外，大部以汽车、火车、马车、或自行车转送。
    电讯事业几乎全部是我们自己建设起来的，现分区以上的党政军民机关，均已恢复和建立了长途电话，一部份县、市机关，也均有电话设备。长治市商用电话也已建设，并可与邯郸商用电话通话。
