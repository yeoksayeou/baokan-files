　　Need Upper-Level Approval to Work in the South
　　To Comrade Wang Suirong:
　　After your graduation from North China University, you have now been assigned to work in the 14th district of the suburban area of ​​Peiping. If you must go to the South, you can submit your opinions to the higher authorities. If the higher authorities believe that it is not necessary and do not approve it, do not let it affect your work mood. South or North, it is all revolutionary work, isn't it the same?

　　要到南方工作须要上级批准王绥戎君：
    你于华大毕业后，现已分配到平郊十四区工作。如必欲南下，可向上级提出自己意见，如上级认为没有必要而不予批准时，也不要因此而影响工作情绪，南方北方，反正都是革命工作，还不是一样吗？
