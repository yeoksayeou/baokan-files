　　Should Gravesites Also Be Divided Equally?
    Question: I have several questions regarding land distribution, please answer:
    1. Should the ancestral gravesites of People's Liberation Army soldiers, as well as the land nearby, be preserved or distributed to others? Are there any special considerations?
    Also, during land redistribution, regardless of whether they are rich, middle, poor, or landless peasants, should the land occupied by their ancestral gravesites be given to them first?
    2. If a village has farm households with one thousand mu of land, or four or five hundred mu, or two or three hundred mu, or twenty mu, what are the criteria for classifying them as rich, middle, or poor peasants?
    　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　Dou Zhixian
    Answer: Here are the answers to the questions in your letter (the question about middle peasants cannot be answered due to insufficient information):
    1. The land occupied by anyone's ancestral gravesites should be preserved and not divided equally. As for the land near the gravesites, if it belongs to the landlord class, according to Article 2 of the Land Law Outline of China: all landlords' land ownership shall be abolished, but when they are allocated the same share as the peasants, whether to allocate the land near the gravesites to them should be decided based on the discussion and decision of the peasant congress.
    In addition, for middle, poor, and landless peasants, there is no need to change the land near their gravesites. After rich peasants hand over their surplus land, they can also retain the land near their gravesites.
    2. According to the 1933 class division document and Comrade Ren Bishi's report, the determination of class should not be based solely on the amount of land occupied, but on the different relationships people have with the means of production to determine their class composition. The various exploitation and exploited relationships arising from the possession or non-possession of the means of production, the amount possessed, what is possessed, and how it is used are the only criteria for class division.
    The main class components in rural areas can generally be divided as follows:
    (1) Those who occupy a large amount of land, do not work themselves, and rely solely on exploiting peasants' land rent, or who also engage in usury for unearned income, are landlords.
    (2) Those who occupy a large amount of land, livestock, and farm tools, participate in major labor themselves, and at the same time exploit peasants' hired labor or rent out land, or also engage in usury, with their exploitation income exceeding 25% of their total income, are rich peasants.
    (3) Those who occupy land, livestock, and farm tools, work themselves, and do not exploit other peasants, or only engage in slight exploitation, are middle peasants.
    (4) Those who occupy a small amount of land, farm tools, etc., work themselves, and also sell a part of their labor, are poor peasants.
    (5) Those who do not occupy land, livestock, and farm tools, and sell their labor, are landless peasants. For detailed regulations, please refer to the 1933 class division document and Comrade Ren Bishi's report on several issues in land reform.

### 坟地是否也要平分？

专栏：询问与答复

　　坟地是否也要平分？
    问：我对土地分配有疑问数点，请解答：
    一、解放军人之先人坟墓占用地，以及左近土地，是否予以保留，或分配给别人？并有无特殊待遇？
    又在平分土地时，不论富、中、贫、雇农，其先人坟墓是否尽先将坟墓占用地分与之？
    二、如某村有一千亩之农户、或四五百亩、或二三百亩、或二十亩之农户，以何标准分为富、中、贫农？
    　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　窦志仙
    答：来信所询问题（其中有关中农问题，因情况介绍不清，不能予以解答。）答复如下：
    一、任何人先人之坟墓占用地均予保留，不应平分。至坟墓左近土地，如属地主阶级，应依照中国土地法大纲第二条：废除一切地主的土地所有权，但在其分得与农民同样一份时，是否将坟墓左近土地分给他，应依据农民大会讨论决定之。
    另外，中、贫、雇农，坟墓左近土地，自可不必变动。富农拿出其多余土地后，亦可保留坟墓左近土地。
    二、依据一九三三年划阶级文件，及任弼时同志报告规定，确定阶级，不应单纯以占有土地亩数多少为标准，而应以人们对于生产资料关系的不同，来确定其阶级成份。由于对生产资料的占有与否，占有多少，占有什么，如何使用，而产生的各种不同的剥削与被剥削关系才是划分阶级的唯一标准。
    农村中的主要阶级成份，一般可划分如下：
    （一）占有多量土地，自己不劳动，专靠剥削农民地租，或兼放高利贷不劳而获的，就是地主。
    （二）占有多量土地、耕畜、农具，自己参加主要劳动，同时剥削农民的雇佣劳动或出租土地，或兼放高利贷，其剥削收入超出其总收入百分之二十五以上者，就是富农。
    （三）占有土地、耕畜、农具，自己劳动，不剥削其他农民，或只有轻微剥削的，就是中农。
    （四）占有少量土地、农具等，自己劳动，同时又出卖一部份劳动力的，就是贫农。
    （五）不占有土地、耕畜、农具，出卖自己劳动力的，就是雇农详细规定可看一九三三年划阶级文件及任弼时同志关于土地改革中的几个问题的报告。
