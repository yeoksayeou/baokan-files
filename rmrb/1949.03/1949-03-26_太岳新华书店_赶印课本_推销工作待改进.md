　　Taiyue Xinhua Bookstore
　　Rush Printing of Textbooks
　　Sales Work Needs Improvement
　　[Taiyue Electric] The Taiyue Xinhua Bookstore has recently rushed to print a large number of elementary school textbooks. Currently, 165,879 copies of junior elementary school textbooks and 12,000 copies of senior elementary school textbooks have been printed. Active efforts are being made to organize sales, and they have been quickly transferred to the students. The principals of the five districts of Yangcheng have wholesaled in bulk from the bookstore, so that students can also receive preferential treatment. However, some places have not paid enough attention to this, and as of now, there are still 86,500 copies of textbooks that have not been transferred to the students, so that the difficulty of textbook shortage has not been completely resolved.

  　赶印课本
  　推销工作待改进
    【太岳电】太岳新华书店近赶印大批小学课本。现已印出初小课本十六万五千八百七十九本，高小课本一万二千册。并积极组织推销，已很快转到学生手里。阳城五区各中心校长，到书店整批批发，使学生还能得到优待。但有些地方就注意不够，截至目前为止，还有八万六千五百册课本，没转到学生手里，使课本缺乏的困难，还没有完全的得到解决。
