　　A Visit to the Forbidden City
　　Cao Ming

　　On the 19th, the East China and Northeast China delegations attending the First National Women's Congress visited the Forbidden City. The Meridian Gate was suddenly filled with the shadows of women representatives. Among them were production activists from various factories, labor heroes from rural areas, combat models, model military dependents, writers, engineers, doctors, students, and cadres who had been tested by more than a decade or two of long-term revolutionary struggle. They were representatives of tens of millions of female compatriots and outstanding figures in various work positions.

　　The guide pointed to the stone path and explained: "The emperor was afraid that someone would dig a tunnel to harm him, so the eight layers of bricks laid under the path are all standing bricks."

　　An old woman listened and stuck out her tongue, saying, "How much manpower did it take to build this!"

　　Liu Guizhen, a female worker from the Shenyang Rubber Factory, had been a worker for sixteen years and suffered from the oppression and exploitation of the Japanese devils and the Kuomintang. Last year, she was liberated with the liberation of Shenyang and was now elected as a representative. When she saw the Forbidden City, she exclaimed with joy:

　　"If Chairman Mao hadn't liberated us, how could we have ever come to such a great place?"

　　Everywhere were vermilion palace walls, exquisite glazed tiles, and magnificent palaces. There was no end to the exquisite carvings and magnificent splendor. The representatives sighed as they looked:

　　"How much money did this cost? The money for carving just one pillar is enough for our common people to live on for a lifetime!" said an agricultural labor hero.

　　"That's right, there are so many things that cost money. There are plenty of jewels and jade inside, aren't they all the blood and sweat of the people!" added a cadre familiar with Beiping.

　　A female worker representative indignantly cursed: "Those feudal ruling classes really knew how to enjoy themselves, only knowing how to exploit the common people. Weren't these beautiful palaces built by the workers? But those who lived in the palaces were those hateful emperors and imperial relatives!"

　　When visiting the "Foreign Guest Reception Room" of the "Empress Dowager Cixi," the image of its luxuriousness, flattery towards foreigners, and tyranny towards its own people immediately aroused lively discussions among these working women. There were many stories about this old demon. It is said that the Summer Palace was a place where she, under the pretext of training the navy and building river embankments, spared no effort in wasting money and manpower to build a place to imitate West Lake for her own amusement. Her absurdity and shamelessness had reached the extreme. The women representatives severely criticized her behavior of only caring about personal enjoyment and disregarding the country's survival.

　　On the way back, although everyone felt a little tired, their spirits were still high. The representatives excitedly and happily sang: "...We will cross the Yangtze River,...Liberate all of China!"

　　故宫参观记
    草明
    十九日，出席全国首届妇女代表大会的华东、东北两个代表团，前往故宫参观。午门前，顿时充满了妇女代表们的影子。她们中，有来自各工厂的生产积极分子，有农村的劳动英雄，有战斗模范，有模范军属，有作家、工程师、医生、学生，和经过十几二十年长期革命斗争考验的干部，她们是千万女同胞的代表者，也是各种工作岗位的优秀人物。
    向导指着石道解释说：“皇帝怕人凿隧道陷害他，所以道下铺的八层砖，都是立砖。”
    一位老大娘听了，吐出舌头说道：“这要花多少人工才能修成！”
    沈阳橡胶厂女工刘桂珍，当了十六年的工人，备受日本鬼子和国民党底压迫剥削，去年随着沈阳的解放而翻了身，现被选为代表；她看见了故宫，高兴得叫起来：
    “要不是毛主席解放了咱，咱还能到得了这大地方？”
    到处是朱红的宫墙，出色的琉璃瓦，金碧辉煌的宫殿。说不尽的精雕细琢，堂皇富丽，代表们一面看一面啧啧叹息：
    “这要花多少钱啊，光是雕一条柱子的钱，就够咱老百姓生活一辈子！”一位农业劳动英雄说。
    “可不是，花钱的东西多啦，里面珠宝玉石有的是，还不都是人民的血汗！”一位熟悉北平的干部接上说。
    一位女工代表愤慨地发恨：“那些封建统治阶级真会享福，只晓得剥削老百姓。这样漂亮的皇宫，还不是工人造的？但是住皇宫的却是那些可恨的皇帝呀、皇亲国戚呀！”
    参观到“慈禧太后”的“外宾接待室”时，那种富丽堂皇、对外献媚对内专横的影子，立即引起这些劳动妇女的议论纷纭，关于这位老妖精的故事很多，据说颐和园，是她借口操练海军、修建河堤，不惜劳民伤财来修造的一个摹仿西湖游玩的去处，其荒淫与无耻已到极点。她的这种只顾个人享受，不惜国家危亡的作为，妇女代表们都给了她以严厉的批判。
    在归途中，大家虽感到有点疲乏，但精神仍很饱满，代表们兴奋愉快地高唱着：“……我们要打过长江去，……解放全中国！”
