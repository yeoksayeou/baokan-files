　　Catching Up with Award-Winning Comrades
    By a Worker of This Newspaper, Ning Shen

    Since our factory checked on the lack of organization and discipline, there has been an improvement in work and leadership. In the past, the leadership lacked praise and punishment. Now, the cadres of the Party branch, administration, and trade union have established new leadership, and administrative management is gradually becoming more standardized. On the worker side, some comrades were passive and slacked off before the study, and some did not obey the leadership. For example, trainee Comrade Du Sanchuan refused to do the work assigned by the section chief and wanted to work in other groups. After this study, he not only obeyed the leadership, but even if he was transferred from day to night work, he had no objections. Moreover, after completing his own task, he also helped the second and third groups with typesetting. Through this study, the cultural level of the worker comrades has been significantly improved. In terms of politics, the class consciousness and labor enthusiasm have also been strengthened, and a new labor attitude has been established. In this short period, many comrades have demonstrated heroic and exemplary deeds. For example, at the commendation meeting held on the afternoon of March 1st, Comrade Zhu Qifa truly realized that the factory was his own and could overcome all difficulties. In particular, when enemy aircraft frantically harassed the factory last September, he took the lead in completing the guard duty without fear of sacrifice, ranking first. More than a dozen people also won second prizes, such as Comrade Cui Fengxiu, who has always been active and responsible in his work, not afraid of hardship, and supported by the masses. More than 30 other people were awarded and commended. Comrades who made mistakes were also punished, some were demoted, and some were warned in person. During the free speech, many comrades said: "In the future, we must work hard to make progress and learn from the award-winning comrades, and strive to win awards next time." At this time, I was both happy and ashamed, thinking over and over in my mind: "How glorious it is for others to win awards! Why didn't I get an award? There must be shortcomings, and I am not active enough in my work. In the future, I must learn from them, work practically and diligently, overcome all difficulties, and catch up with those award-winning comrades."

　　赶上受奖的同志
    本报工人  宁身
    本厂自从检查了无组织无纪律后，工作上、领导上都改进了一步。以前领导上缺少表扬与处分，现在支部、行政及工会各干部都树立起了新的领导，行政管理上也渐渐走向正规。工人方面，在学习前有的同志消极怠工，有的不服从领导。如练习生杜三川同志，股长分配的工作，他不干，要到其他组工作。经过这次学习，不仅服从领导，就是由白天调到黑夜工作，他也没有意见，而且完成自己任务后还帮助二、三组分字。经过这次学习，工人同志文化更有显著的提高。政治方面也加强了阶级觉悟和劳动热情，树立起新的劳动态度。在这短短的期间，很多同志都表现出英雄模范的事情。如三月一日下午召开的奖惩大会，朱启发同志由于真正认识到工厂是自己的，一切困难都能克服，特别是去年九月间敌人飞机疯狂袭扰时，他以身作则不怕牺牲的完成了警卫任务，占第一名。得二等奖的也有十几人，如崔峰秀同志，他在工作上一贯积极负责，不怕吃苦，群众都拥护他。其他得奖受表扬的共有卅多人。犯错误的同志也受到处分，有的降级，有的当面警告，在自由讲话时许多同志都说：今后一定要在工作上努力进步，向得奖同志看齐，争取下次受奖。这时，我又高兴，又惭愧，脑子里想来想去：人家得了奖多么光荣呀！自己为何不受奖呢？必定有缺点，工作上还不积极。今后一定要向他们学习，脚踏实地的工作，埋头苦干，克服一切困难，赶上那些得奖的同志。
