　　Huada Shishi Veterinary Station
　　Going to the Countryside to Treat Livestock
    [Our Newspaper] The Shijiazhuang Veterinary Education Work Station of Huada Agricultural College recently sent fifteen students and two Chinese and Western medicine veterinarians to form two medical teams to actively treat livestock for the masses in Zhentou Village and other places. They also publicized common knowledge about livestock feeding and management, which was welcomed by the local people. In addition to the existing students, the station added twenty-one new students in March. In February, they had already cured eighty-one head of livestock, mostly suffering from conditions such as not eating grass, cold spleen and stomach, and leg lameness. The station now employs Chinese and Western medicine veterinarians to actively cultivate veterinary technical personnel.
