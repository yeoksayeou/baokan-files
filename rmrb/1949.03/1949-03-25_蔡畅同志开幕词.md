Comrade Sisters, Esteemed Guests:

　　The First National Congress of Chinese Women opens today in the newly liberated ancient cultural city of Peiping. This is the first national-scale grand meeting in the history of Chinese women. The delegates present come from liberated areas and KMT-controlled areas, from border provinces and overseas regions. There are urban female workers, rural working women, female soldiers in the army, revolutionary technical personnel and intellectuals, professional women in various work positions, women of various religions and democratic parties, and women of ethnic minorities. Some of them were oppressed and enslaved working women in the Kuomintang-controlled areas yesterday, but today they have been liberated and become masters of the new society; some are outstanding heroes and models in various industries and revolutionary professionals who have experienced various periods of the Chinese revolution, truly representing the excellent daughters of the Chinese nation. What is particularly proud is that our representatives from the liberated areas are all elected by women's congresses at all levels in various regions, with a solid foundation of millions of women, and are truly representatives of the masses. Even the representatives from the Kuomintang-controlled areas, although they could not be openly elected due to environmental restrictions, were also produced through various democratic means.

　　The reason why our delegates can gather in the ancient cultural city of Peiping today to hold such a grand meeting is entirely due to the wise leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, the unprecedented and great victory of the Chinese People's Liberation War, and the result of the persistent struggle of millions of people and women. For this, on behalf of all the comrades present, I would like to pay tribute to Chairman Mao Zedong, the leader of the Chinese Communist Party, pay tribute to Commander-in-Chief Zhu De of the Chinese People's Liberation Army and all its commanders and fighters, pay tribute to the heroic men and women compatriots who fought bravely, and express our condolences to the revolutionary martyrs who sacrificed for the revolution.

　　Comrades! The opening of our congress comes at the eve of the Chinese people's revolution achieving its final victory throughout the country. The Kuomintang reactionaries are about to completely collapse, and national liberation is just around the corner. However, the Kuomintang reactionaries, under the instigation of American imperialism, are playing tricks of false peace to cover up their reorganization of the remaining military forces, attempting to continue to resist and stage a comeback. If the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang is not eliminated for a single day, our women will not be completely liberated. Therefore, our congress must call on women of all strata across the country to further strengthen their unity, smash the Kuomintang reactionaries' conspiracy of false peace, resolutely support Chairman Mao Zedong's eight peace conditions, carry the revolution through to the end, completely eliminate the reactionary forces of the Kuomintang, and build a unified people's democratic republic. We must call on the masses of women throughout China to warmly respond to the call of the Preparatory Committee of the World Congress for the Defence of Peace, and unite with international peace-loving people to fight for the defense of human peace and against new war instigators.

　　The purpose of our congress is to clearly formulate the current principles and tasks of the Chinese women's movement, establish a leading organization for the national women's movement, strengthen the unity of women across the country, review the strength of women across the country, exchange work experience in various regions, and promote the national women's movement, so that Chinese women can make greater contributions in the struggle against imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism.

　　Comrades! We are here entrusted by the masses of women. We must faithfully represent the opinions of the masses of women, care about the interests of the masses of women, wholeheartedly serve the masses of women, carefully study the various reports and resolutions of the congress, and formulate practical work programs in order to greatly push the women's movement forward. Comrades! Our title is glorious, our responsibility is great, and I believe that everyone will be able to successfully complete the tasks of the congress in an atmosphere of democracy, unity, and harmony. I wish the congress a complete success! (Attached picture)

　　蔡畅同志开幕词诸位姊妹诸位来宾：
    中国妇女第一次全国代表大会，今天在新解放的文化古都北平开幕了，这是中国妇女有史以来的第一次全国规模的盛大会议。到会的各位代表，来自解放区和国统区，来自边疆各省和海外各地。有城市女工，农村劳动妇女，有军队的女战士，有革命的技术人员和知识分子，有各个工作岗位上的职业妇女，有信仰各种宗教及各民主党派的妇女，还有少数民族妇女。其中有些昨天还是国民党统治区被压迫的受奴役的劳动妇女，今天得到了解放，成为新社会的主人；有些是各行各业出色的英雄模范和经历过中国革命各个时期的革命职业者，真正集中了中华民族的优秀的女儿。特别值得骄傲的，我们解放区的各位代表，都是各地区各级妇女代表大会选举产生的，有着千百万妇女群众坚实的基础，是名符其实的群众代表。就是国民党统治区的代表，虽然因为环境限制，不能公开选举，也是经过各种各样民主方式产生的。
    我们各位代表，今天所以能聚集在文化古都北平举行这样盛大的会议，完全由于中国共产党英明的领导，中国人民解放战争空前伟大的胜利，千百万人民和妇女坚持奋斗的结果；为此，我代表到会的全体同志，向中国共产党领袖毛泽东主席致敬，向中国人民解放军朱德总司令及全体指战员致敬，向英勇奋斗的男女同胞致敬，向为革命牺牲的男女先烈们致哀。
    同志们！我们这次大会的开幕，正是处在中国人民革命即将在全国取得最后胜利的前夜，国民党反动派即将完全崩溃，全国解放，为期不远，但是国民党反动派，在美帝国主义策动之下，玩弄虚伪和平，以掩护其重新组织残余的军事力量，企图继续抵抗，卷土重来。如果国民党反动统治一天不消灭，我们妇女便不能获得彻底的解放。因此我们这次大会要号召全国各阶层妇女，更加强自己的团结，粉碎国民党反动派假和平的阴谋，坚决拥护毛泽东主席的八项和平条件，把革命进行到底，完全肃清国民党反动势力，建设统一的人民民主共和国。我们要号召全中国妇女群众，热烈响应世界拥护和平大会筹委会的号召，和国际爱好和平人士在一起，为保卫人类的和平，反对新的战争挑拨者而奋斗。
    我们这次大会的目的，要明确制订中国妇女运动当前的方针任务，成立全国妇女运动的领导机构，加强全国妇女的团结，检阅全国妇女的力量，交流各地工作经验，推进全国妇女运动，使中国妇女在反帝反封建反官僚资本主义的斗争中，能有更大的贡献。
    同志们！我们是受了妇女群众的委任而来的，我们要忠实代表妇女群众的意见，关心妇女群众的利益，全心全意为妇女群众办事，仔细研讨大会各种报告及决议，制订切合实际的工作纲领，以便把妇女运动大大推向前一步。同志们！我们的称号是光荣的，我们的责任是重大的，我相信，大家一定能在民主团结和洽的空气里，胜利地完成大会的任务，谨向大会预祝成功！（附图片）
