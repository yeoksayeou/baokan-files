　　【Taiyue Telegraph】Yongtai Village, in the Second District of Jiyuan, has transformed 700 mu of low-lying, wet land into fertile fields by dredging ditches and draining water. This village has already completed land reform and party rectification, and the cadres and masses have a high level of enthusiasm for production, urgently demanding to engage in production. To the north of the village, there were originally 700 mu of good land, but because the terrain was low and wet, the land would flood during the rainy season, sometimes making it impossible to even plant wheat. Last autumn, there was a lot of rain, which flooded the lush autumn seedlings, resulting in a significant reduction in the grain harvest. After the Lunar New Year, on the fifth day of the first month, the county government convened a meeting of village cadres to discuss water conservancy issues. Zhang Wenxiang, the village chief of Yongtai Village, returned to the village after the meeting and convened a village-wide meeting on the seventh day to give the masses a detailed account, explaining that the 700 mu of land had yielded 560 shi less grain last year, which was a great loss. Everyone agreed to start work immediately. Li Tangming said, "There's no need to mobilize for this; everyone is willing, and I guarantee everyone will go tomorrow!" Work began on the ninth day and was completed by the sixteenth. Originally, it was planned that each worker could dredge 1.2 zhang per day, but because everyone was so enthusiastic, each worker averaged 2 zhang, for a total of 480 zhang of ditches dredged; the river mouth was also widened by 5 chi, and the riverbed was widened by 3 chi, so that the water could seep into the river, and more than 700 mu of low-lying, wet land became fertile fields. The county government specially awarded them a banner, which read: "Actively respond to the government's call and are a model for reclaiming low-lying land."

　　永太村积极挑渠疏水
  　七百亩水淹地变成良田
    【太岳电】济源二区永太村由于挑渠疏水，已使七百亩下湿地变成了良田。这村土地改革整党已经完成了，干部和群众生产情绪很高，迫切要求进行生产。村北面原有七百亩好地，但因地势下湿，一到雨季地里水就聚成泊地，有时连麦子也不能种了。去年秋天雨水多，就把绿油油的秋苗都淹了，少打了很多粮食。过了旧历年正月初五，县政府召集各村干部开会讨论了水利问题。永太村村长张文香同志开完会回村，初七就召开了全村大会，给群众详细算了一下帐，说明去年七百亩地共少打了五百六十石粮食，是个大损失。大家都赞成当下就动工。栗棠明说：“这个就不用动员，谁也愿意，明天保证大家都去！”初九动工，到十六便完成了。原来计划每工每天能挑一丈二尺，但因大家热情很高，每工平均挑了两丈，总共挑开渠道四百八十丈；又把河口挖宽了五尺，河底挖宽三尺，使水能够渗到河里去，七百多亩下湿地就变成良田了。县政府特奖给他们一面锦旗，上写着：“积极响应政府号召，是开垦下地的模范。”
