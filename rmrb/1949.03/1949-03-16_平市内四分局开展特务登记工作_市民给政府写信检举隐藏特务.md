　　The Fourth Precinct of the Public Security Bureau of the People's Government of Beiping Municipality has actively launched the work of registering Kuomintang special agents. Since the Municipal Public Security Bureau issued Public Notice No. 1 on the 5th of this month, strictly ordering special agents to register as soon as possible, the bureau has convened a bureau affairs meeting to study the instructions from higher authorities and make arrangements. The District Working Committee also issued instructions, mobilizing all party, government, and civilian organizations in the district to cooperate effectively. In addition to conducting extensive publicity to the masses through the street working groups, mobilizing the masses to urge special agents to register and report, the sub-bureau also organized a special working group to go deep into various sub-stations and police stations to supervise the work and investigate the situation. The registration office of the sub-bureau started work on the 8th, and the number of registrants has gradually increased in recent days. Some of these elements still do not have a sufficient understanding of the lenient policy and the bright future after registering and starting anew, and therefore their confessions are not thorough enough. Some only admit that they are members of special agent organizations, but have not sincerely talked about their situation; others only hand over some weapons, radios, documents, etc., and hide the rest. The registration office will further explain the policy to them and urge them to continue to confess thoroughly. There are also many who truly understand the lenient policy and see the bright future after registering and starting anew. For example, Ma Yi, a secret agent of the Military Statistics Bureau, described in detail his past evil deeds as a special agent during registration. He said: "The People's Government allows us to repent and start anew. As long as we correct our evil ways and become good people in the future, our future is still bright." Zhang Shihe, a secret agent of the Military Statistics Bureau, after registering himself, went to persuade other special agents to register. Since the beginning of registration, although the masses in the district have unanimously hated the criminal acts of special agents, some of them still have concerns, so extensive mass reporting activities are still in the initial stages, and some of the reporting letters received by the registration office in recent days are unsigned. These masses still need further enlightenment. On the other hand, there are also many masses who dare to take responsibility for reporting. For example, Wang Yan, a resident of Xinjiekou, wrote at the end of his reporting letter: "The above are all facts. If there is any falsehood, the reporter is willing to surrender himself to the authorities for the crime of false accusation, and please investigate." Wang Zikuan, a resident of Dongtangzi Street, also wrote at the end of his reporting letter: "The above is indeed the truth, and there is absolutely no falsehood... The People's Government handles affairs very thoroughly, and I dare not make false reports. Now, the people are lenient towards those who repent and start anew, but those public enemies who are stubbornly clinging to their views and waiting for an opportunity to act must be eliminated. Reporting is the responsibility of the people..." Li Guan, a tricycle driver from Xiaozhulian Hutong, who could not write a reporting letter himself, reported verbally to the registration office. After receiving the reporting letters, the registration office, in order to prevent special agents from using the name of mass reporting to write blacklists and disrupt the registration work, conducts detailed investigations before handling them. In the registration work, it is actively enlightening incumbent former police officers to recognize that this is a practical test to actively transform themselves and serve the people, because they have a better understanding of the past situation, and once they are awakened, they can achieve considerable work results. For example, Sun Naijing and Wu Shifu, former police officers of the 14th and 19th police stations in the district, are examples of this.

　　平市内四分局开展特务登记工作
    市民给政府写信检举隐藏特务
    【本报讯】北平市人民政府公安局内四分局办理国民党特务登记的工作已积极展开。自本月五日市公安局发布公字第一号布告，严令特务分子从速登记后，该局即召开局务会议，研究上级指示，进行布置。区工委亦发出指示，动员全区党政民各机关团体作有力配合。除通过各街工作组向群众广泛宣传，发动群众督促特务登记并检举外，分局也组织了一个专责工作组，深入各分所、派出所督促工作，调查了解情况。分局登记处自八日开始办公，连日来登记者逐渐增多。其中若干分子对宽大政策及登记自新后之光明前途认识尚有不足，因而坦白不够澈底。或只承认自己是特务组织的分子，但并未真诚谈出自己情况；或只缴出一部武器、电台、文件等，而隐蔽其余部分。登记处当进一步向其解释政策，劝令其继续彻底坦白。而真正了解宽大政策及看出登记自新后之光明前途者也不少，如军统特务马毅，登记时即详述了自己以往的特务恶迹，他说：“人民政府允许我们悔过自新，只要今后改邪归正，作一个好人民，我们的出路还是光明的。”军统特务张世和，他自己登记后，又去劝说了其他特务进行登记。自开始登记以来，该区群众虽对特务分子的罪恶行为一致痛恨，但部分群众仍有顾虑，因之广泛的群众检举活动尚在开始，登记处连日收到的检举信中也就有些是未署名的。这些群众尚待进一步的启发。而另一方面，大胆负责检举的群众也不少，如新街口住户王炎的检举信末就写有：“以上皆系事实，如有虚伪，报告人愿自投案处诬告罪，并请调查。”等语。东堂子街住户王子宽的检举信末也写道：“以上确系事实，确无私毫虚伪，……人民政府办事又很彻底，绝不敢虚报。现在人民宽大的是悔过自新的人，对这些执迷不悟待机活动的公敌，一定要肃清，检举是人民责任……”。小珠帘胡同三轮车夫李冠，自己不会写检举信，便口头报告登记处进行检举。登记处接到检举信后，因防特务分子假借群众检举之名而滥写黑名检举信捣乱登记工作，均经详细调查始行处理。在登记工作中，积极启发现职旧警察认识这是积极改造自己、为人民服务的一个实际考验，因为他们对过去情况比较了解，一经觉悟，就能收到颇大的工作效果。如该区十四、十九派出所旧员警孙乃精、吴世富等即为此种范例。
