　　Tianjin Completes Spring Cleaning
    [Tianjin Electric] Tianjin City has successfully completed its spring cleaning campaign. All 50,000 *fang* (each *fang* being 27 cubic feet, or about 1,500 *jin*) of filth accumulated during the Kuomintang rule have been transported out of the city. This work began in mid-February. The People's Government Health Bureau, Civil Affairs Bureau, and district governments universally mobilized male and female residents to participate in the cleaning. The Public Security Bureau's Cleaning Team also extracted some members from each detachment to form a 291-person shock force, concentrating ten trucks, eighteen horse-drawn carts, and ninety-five rickshaws to participate in transportation, assisting in the successful completion of the cleaning campaign. In the future, the Cleaning Team will transport the day's filth daily, so that garbage will no longer accumulate in the city.
