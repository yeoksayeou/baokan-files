　　A Painful Memory
　　Driver Lu Kui Exposes the Reactionaries' Heinous Crime of Massacring Thirty-Odd Workers
　　Lu Kui, a truck driver of the 3rd Transportation Company of the 41st Army, used his personal experiences of three years ago to expose the "peace" conspiracy of the Kuomintang reactionaries during his current affairs study.

　　In the spring of 1946, I was driving for the automobile team of the Second War Area of Chiang Kai-shek's bandits in Datong Prefecture, Shanxi Province. Although Japan had surrendered half a year earlier, we still often went out of the city to fight the Eighth Route Army. At that time, I heard that the United States and China were "friendly" and wanted to "help" China "mediate the civil war." I was really happy at that time, "This is great, China is at peace, and the people should have a good life!" But the war became more and more intense. While the "three-person teams" were flying all over the place (note: meaning "mediating" everywhere), the Kuomintang's secret killings became more and more ferocious. When I think about these things now, my scalp still tingles.

　　That night was cloudy, and the wind was very cold. In the middle of the night, the captain told me to start the car, saying, "Go to the special prison of the police station at 4:30 to pick up 'prisoners'." I started the car. A group of people in plain clothes carrying guns came in from outside. I recognized them as "field personnel" from the county party headquarters. They whispered a few words to the captain, and then told me to drive.

　　When we arrived at the prison gate, a person holding a small, pointed knife (about twenty centimeters long) in his right hand, stuck behind his back, greeted the "prisoners" with his left hand, asking them to come out one by one. After calling the "prisoners" in front of him, he would say with a fake smile, "Please open your mouths and let me see what's in them?" Those simple-minded "prisoners" would actually open their mouths. Who knew they were hiding a knife behind their smiles, and taking advantage of their unguardedness, they would viciously stab the "prisoners" in the throat with the pointed knife in their right hand. After a "prisoner" was stabbed, another person would immediately stuff cotton into their throat with force, and then throw them into the truck. Oh! I crouched in the shadows, my eyes flashing with fire, and my body tingling. I felt like my head was bigger than a bucket...

　　While they were committing the crime, I saw one of my friends among the "prisoners." He was a train repairman in the Datong Locomotive Depot workshop. I knew he was a very good and honest person. He was friendly to everyone, and everyone said he was a good old man. But what "crime" did he commit? When I saw his throat being pierced by the murderer, oh! My soul left my body! Then I heard people being pulled out of the prison shouting, "Why are you harming people for no reason!" "We are coal mine workers. Is digging coal a crime too?" The murderers still said, "Don't be afraid, just open your mouth and let me see!" Then I heard the last one coming out say, "@ Your mother! I don't have anything in my mouth, you don't need to look! If you want to kill, just do it!" He refused to open his mouth, so the murderers pressed his head down, one using his knee to push his buttocks, two holding his arms and pulling them back, and one holding a knife in his right hand, stabbing wildly at his head, face, mouth, nose, and eyes, without discrimination. Then I heard the "prisoner's" painful curses and screams... Oh! Until the "prisoner's" head became a pile of mush and there was no sound at all, they threw him into the truck. My heart felt like it was about to jump out of my mouth, and my soul had long gone to hell. I wanted to run but I couldn't move...

　　Outside the west gate, on the north side of the dry well, stood a menacing team with bayonets. As soon as I stopped the car, the murderers pushed the "prisoners" down from the truck one by one. The team on the ground went up and stabbed them in the back with a bayonet, throwing them into the dry well. More than thirty innocent workers died under the butchers' knives.

　　Now, the reactionaries are shouting about "peace" again. We want "peace" under Chairman Mao's eight conditions, and we will never accept the kind of "peace" that allows the reactionaries to slaughter our worker brothers and the people of the whole country. We must never be fooled.

　　一个沉痛的回忆
    驾驶员陆奎揭露反动派  惨杀三十多个工人的罪行
    四十一军辎三连，汽车驾驶员陆奎在时事学习中，他以三年前亲身经历的事实来揭露国民党反动派的“和平”阴谋。
    一九四六年开春的时候，我在山西省大同府蒋匪第二战区汽车队开车，那时虽然日本投降半年了，可是还常出城和八路军打仗。就在这个时候，听说美国和中国“友好”，要“帮助”中国“调处内战”。我那时心里真高兴呵，“这可不错，中国和平了，老百姓可该过好日子啦！”可是仗倒越打越大了，就在什么“三人小组”满天飞（按：即到处“调处”的意思）的时候，国民党偷着杀人的事情也越来越凶，这些事我现在想起来还觉头皮一炸一炸的呢。
    那天黑夜是阴天，风刮的很凉，半夜三更队长叫我把车发动好，说：“四点半到警察局特别监狱拉‘犯人’去”。我把车发动好了，从外面进来一群穿便衣扛枪的人，我认识那是县党部的“外勤”人员，他们和队长嘴对耳朵说了几句话，就叫我开车。
    到了监狱门口，右手拿着一把“一那”（约二十生的）多长的小尖刀子插在背后，左手打招呼，要“犯人”一个个的出来，把“犯人”叫到眼前以后，满脸假笑的说：“请你们把嘴张开我看看，嘴里含着什么？”那些实心眼的“犯人”们就真的把嘴张开了。哪知他们是笑里藏刀，趁人不防备，把右手里的尖刀子恶狠狠的插进“犯人”的嗓子。“犯人”被插倒了，另一个就马上用棉花使劲塞到嗓子里，再扔到车上。嗳呀！我蹲在黑影里，眼里直冒火星，身上一阵阵的发麻，我觉着脑袋比斗还大……
    正在他们行凶的时候，我看见“犯人”中有我的一个朋友，他是大同机务段工场火车修理工，我知道他是个非常好的老实人，他没有交不来的朋友，谁也说他是个老好人。可是他犯了什么“法”呢？当我看见他嗓子里被凶手通上刀的时候，啊呀！我的魂都走了！又听到监狱里正往外拉的人喊着：“你们为什么无故害人哪！”“我们是煤洞的工人，挖煤还挖出罪来吗？…”凶手们还是说：“别害怕，你张开嘴我看看就行了！”我又听到最后出来的那个说：“＠你妈！我嘴里没有东西，不用你看！要杀就干脆些！”他说什么也不张嘴，凶手们就一个把着头往下压的，一个用膝盖顶着庇股，两手把着膀子往后扯的，一个就右手执刀不分头、脸、嘴、鼻、眼的乱插，再听到那“犯人”的痛骂，惨叫……嗳呀！直到“犯人”那个脑袋成了肉酱、一点声音没有了，才扔到车上。我的心就象要跳到嘴里去，我的魂早到地狱里去了，我想跑也跑不动了……。
    西门外北边的枯井，周围站着恶狠狠端着刺刀的队伍，我刚把车停下，凶手们就把“犯人”一个个的从车箱上推下来了，地下的队伍上去照背后就是一刺刀通到枯井里。三十多个无辜的工人，就这样死在屠夫们的屠刀下了。
    现在，反动派又喊起“和平”了。我们要毛主席八项条件下的“和平”，决不要反动派屠杀我们工人弟兄全国人民的那种“和平”，我们绝不能上当。
