Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, March 21st: TASS, Paris - The Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the French Communist Party passed the following resolution at its meeting on March 17th: The Political Bureau solemnly protests the government's decision to sign the North Atlantic Treaty, a decision that presents the parliament and the nation with a fait accompli. The organizers of the North Atlantic Treaty dare to call it a defensive treaty, but in reality, it is a weapon of aggression against our ally, the Soviet Union, and the People's Democracies. If the criminal plans of the warmongers were to be realized, France would be turned into a dueling ground for atomic warfare by American imperialists, and the French people would become the infantry of the West, destined to be destroyed for the maximum benefit of British, American, and French capitalists.

The Political Bureau calls on all French men and women who desire peace, regardless of political or religious belief, to unite and fight together against the North Atlantic Treaty that the French government is preparing to sign.

The Political Bureau authorizes the Communist parliamentary group to demand that the Speaker of the National Assembly debate the North Atlantic Treaty at the meetings on March 22nd and 23rd.

　　法共中央通过决议
    抗议签字北大西洋公约
    【新华社陕北二十一日电】塔斯社巴黎讯：法国共产党中央委员会政治局三月十七日会议通过决议如下：政治局宣告郑重抗议政府的签字北大西洋公约的决定，这一决定置议会与国家于既成事实之前。北大西洋公约的组织者居然把该约说成是防御性公约，实际上该约乃是对我们的同盟者——苏联以及对人民民主国家的侵略武器。如果战争挑拨者的犯罪计划竟得实现，就会把法国变成美国帝国主义者进行原子战争的决斗场，法国人就将成为西方的步兵，注定了要为英美和法国资本家的最大利益而归于毁灭。
    政治局号召一切愿望和平的法国男女，不分政治和宗教信仰，团结起来，共同进行斗争，反对法国政府正在准备签字的北大西洋公约。
    政治局授权共产党议会党团要求国民议会议长在三月二十二、二十三日会议上辩论北大西洋公约。
