　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 19th: Moscow dispatch: Panfyorova, one of the chairpersons of the Soviet Women's Anti-Fascist Committee, delivered a speech at the congress of primary and secondary school teachers' union here, introducing the International Federation of Education Workers, which Soviet teachers and workers in higher education institutions joined last December. Panfyorova said that the main purpose of this organization is for peace, to cooperate with the working class, and to fight for the democratization of schools and the improvement of teachers' status. Panfyorova said that the purpose of the International Federation of Education Workers is to unite all ideologically progressive teachers in the world and to educate children and young people in a democratic spirit. Panfyorova cited facts to illustrate the situation of schools and teachers in various countries. She said that the Soviet Union's good example in children's education has many followers. In the people's democratic countries of Southeast Europe, the interests of mothers and children are now protected by law, and the network of various children's institutions is expanding. Thanks to the government's concern, the child mortality rate in the people's democratic countries has been reduced by 50 percent in the past year alone. After the school reforms were completed, 50 to 60 percent of middle school students are children of working people. The Mongolian People's Republic, which used to have only one middle school, now has hundreds of such schools. The situation is similar in North Korea. In countries ruled by capitalist forces and reactionaries, the situation is completely different. According to official statistics, 500,000 teachers in the United States have abandoned their professions, and 6 million children have been deprived of the opportunity to attend school. The Education Act passed in the United Kingdom in 1944 has not been implemented. In the past four years, only sixteen schools have been built there. The situation of children and teachers in colonies and dependent countries is particularly serious. Among the 500 million children in the colonies, 480 million have never been to school. The International Federation of Education Workers issued an appeal to educational groups in various countries that have not joined the federation, inviting them to participate in order to jointly fight against imperialism and strive for school democratization and universal peace.

　　潘菲诺娃发表演说
    国际教育工作者联合会
    决争取和平与学校民主化
    【新华社陕北十九日电】莫斯科讯：苏联妇女反法西斯委员会主席之一潘菲诺娃在此间中小学教师联合会代表大会上发表演说，介绍苏联教师与高级教育机关的工作者去年十二月加入的国际教育工作者联合会。潘菲诺娃说：这个组织的主要目的是为了和平，与工人阶级合作，并为学校民主化与教师地位的改善而奋斗。潘菲诺娃说：国际教育工作者联合会的目的，是团结世界上一切思想进步的教师，本着民主精神来教育儿童和青年。潘菲诺娃援引事实，说明各国学校与教师的状况。她说：苏联在儿童教养问题上的好榜样，现有许多追随者。东南欧人民民主国家中的母亲和儿童的利益，现在受到法律的保护，各种儿童机关网正在扩大中由于政府的关怀，单在去年一年中，人民民主国家儿童死亡率就减少了百分之五十。在学校改革完成后，百分之五十到六十的中学生是劳动人民的子弟，蒙古人民共和国过去只有一个中学校，现在有着几百个这种学校。北朝鲜的情形也是如此。在资本主义势力和反动派统治的国家里，情形则完全不同。根据官方统计，美国有五十万教师抛弃了他们的职业，六百万儿童被剥夺了上学的可能。英国在一九四四年通过的普及中学教育法案一直没有实行。在过去四年中，那里只建立了十六座学校。殖民地和附属国家里的儿童与教师情况尤其严重。在殖民地的五亿儿童中，就有四亿八千万人没有进过学校。国际教育工作者联合会向各国没有参加联合会的教育团体发出呼吁，邀请它们参加，以便共同进行反对帝国主义，争取学校民主化与普遍和平的斗争。
