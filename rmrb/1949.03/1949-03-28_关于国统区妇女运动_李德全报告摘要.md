Xinhua News Agency, Beiping, March 27th: The First National Congress of Chinese Women listened to Li Dequan's report on "The Democratic Women's Movement in the Kuomintang-Controlled Areas" yesterday afternoon.

　　Li Dequan first paid tribute to the congress on behalf of the oppressed women in the Kuomintang-controlled areas. She said that the democratic women's movement in the Kuomintang-controlled areas was consistent with the anti-imperialist, anti-feudalist, and anti-bureaucratic capitalist democratic movement in the Kuomintang-controlled areas, and coordinated with the women's movement in the Chinese Liberated Areas. She condemned the Kuomintang reactionaries for selling out national interests and colluding with American imperialism to carry out an anti-people civil war, which made women in the Kuomintang-controlled areas live a life worse than slaves, and many women suffered the humiliation of being raped by American soldiers. She cited the case of Shen Chong, a female student at Peking University, being raped by an American soldier, the case of Zhao Xunzhi and more than 30 other female students at Nanjing Central University being beaten and injured by Kuomintang military police for participating in the anti-hunger movement, as well as the Shen Jiu Textile Factory massacre and the Shanghai dance hall girl struggle massacre. She said: These bloody facts have educated the oppressed women in the Kuomintang-controlled areas, making them gradually realize that only by completely eliminating the Kuomintang reactionary rule of imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism, can they be liberated from oppression. Then, she described the struggles of women from all walks of life in the Kuomintang-controlled areas. First, she recounted the glorious tradition of the female workers' struggle since the "May 30th" Movement. She said: On June 23, 1946, 100,000 Shanghai citizens held a large anti-civil war demonstration, 60 percent of whom were female workers. In the Shen Jiu Textile Factory massacre on February 2, 1948, more than 6,000 female workers waged a resolute struggle against the Kuomintang reactionary government's armored forces. Secondly, she talked about the heroic deeds of female students in the movement protesting the Shen Chong incident, the anti-hunger movement, the anti-civil war movement, the anti-persecution movement, and the anti-American support-Japan movement. After describing the participation of some professional women in the anti-hunger movement, she described in detail the democratic activities carried out by various democratic women's organizations. She talked about the democratic movements carried out by the China Women's Association and its five branches in Shanghai, Chongqing, Nanjing, Beiping, and Hong Kong, as well as women's federations in Yunnan, Chengdu, Guilin, Hong Kong and Kowloon, and other places. She particularly mentioned that on the "March 8th" International Women's Day in 1946, the Shanghai Women's Federation mobilized 60,000 women to hold an anti-civil war demonstration. The members of the women's federations who were forced to flee to Hong Kong launched a women's signature campaign in response to the CCP's "May 1st" call for a new political consultation conference. She also praised the contributions of the rural women near the South China Guerrilla Area in supporting the guerrillas. Finally, she analyzed the current revolutionary situation and said: The People's Liberation Army has shattered the Kuomintang reactionary rule. However, the reactionaries are still playing tricks with fake peace conspiracies. Therefore, she called on the democratic women in the Kuomintang-controlled areas to strengthen the unity of the broad masses of oppressed women, unite with the people of the whole country, closely coordinate with the women's movement in the Liberated Areas, respond to the eight peace conditions put forward by the people's leader Mao Zedong, carry the revolution through to the end, cooperate with the People's Liberation Army, eliminate the reactionary forces, and establish a New Democratic coalition government.

　　关于国统区妇女运动
  　李德全报告摘要
    【新华社北平二十七日电】昨天下午，中国妇女第一次全国代表大会听取了李德全所作“国民党统治区民主妇女运动”的报告。
    李德全首先代表国民党统治区被压迫的妇女，向大会致敬。她说国民党统治区的民主妇女运动是和国民党统治区反帝国主义，反封建主义，反官僚资本主义的民主运动一致的，是和中国解放区妇女运动相配合的。她谴责国民党反动集团出卖国家民族利益，勾结美帝国主义进行反人民的内战，使国民党统治区的妇女过着奴隶不如的生活，不少妇女并蒙受了美军强奸的耻辱。她列举了北大女生沈崇被美军强奸事件，南京中大女生赵巽之等三十多人参加反饥饿运动被国民党军警毒打受伤的事件，以及申九纱厂的惨案，上海舞女斗争的惨案等。她说：这些血的事实教育了国民党统治区被压迫的妇女，使她们逐渐的认识了只有彻底消灭这个帝国主义、封建主义、官僚资本主义三位一体的国民党反动统治，自己才能从压迫之下解放出来。接着，她分别的叙述国民党统治区各阶层妇女斗争的情况。首先，她历述自“五卅”以来有光荣传统的女工斗争，她说：一九四六年六月二十三日上海十万市民反内战大示威游行，其中有百分之六十是女工。一九四八年二月二日申九纱厂的大屠杀中，六千多女工和国民党反动政府的装甲武装作了坚决的斗争。其次，她讲到女学生在抗议沈崇事件的运动中，反饥饿，反内战运动，反迫害运动，反美扶日运动等运动中所表现的英勇事迹。她在叙述了部分职业妇女参加反饥饿运动的情况以后，详细地叙述了各民主妇女团体所做的民主活动。她讲到中国妇女联谊会和她的上海、重庆、南京、北平、香港五个分会以及云南、成都、桂林、港九等各地妇联等所作的民主运动。她特别提到一九四六年“三八”节上海妇联曾号召了六万妇女群众，举行反内战示威。各地被迫逃到香港的妇联会员，曾发动了一个响应中共“五一”新政协号召的妇女签名运动。她并赞扬了华南游击区附近的农妇，支持游击队的各种贡献。最后，她分析目前的革命形势说：人民解放军已经把国民党反动统治打击得支离破碎，土崩瓦解了。可是，反动派还在玩弄假和平阴谋。因此，她号召国民党统治区的民主妇女加紧团结广大被压迫的妇女群众，和全国人民在一起，密切配合解放区的妇女运动，响应人民领袖毛泽东所提的八项和平条件，把革命进行到底，配合人民解放军，把反动势力消灭干净，建立新民主主义的联合政府。
