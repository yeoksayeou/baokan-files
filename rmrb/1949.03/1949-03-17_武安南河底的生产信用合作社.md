　　I. The Collapse and Reorganization of the Cooperative

　　The cooperative in Nanhedi Village, Wu'an County, was established in the famine year of November 1942. At that time, it mainly engaged in buying and selling to earn some money. After the summer harvest of 1944, the cooperative director, Comrade Zhang Xigui, accepted the demands of the masses and shifted the focus to supporting mass production. By consulting with cadres and the masses in everything, he gradually won the support of the masses.

　　II. The Integration of Cooperative Undertakings with Agricultural and Sideline Production

　　After the summer harvest of 1945, the cooperative purchased 7,000 jin of coal and sold it to the masses at a low price, solving the fuel problem during the busy summer hoeing season and saving labor for weeding. In July of the same year, the cooperative discovered that the crops in the fields plowed by human-pulled plows were not growing well, and the autumn harvest would obviously be reduced. After discussion with the masses, the cooperative allocated 14,000 yuan to purchase four oxen and two plows to cultivate 210 mu of wheat fields and 200 mu of autumn fields. It provided free cultivation for the land of poor military families and charged 10 yuan per mu for poor peasants and 15 yuan per mu for middle peasants. As a result, the cultivated land saved a total of 16,000 yuan compared to the market price, and the cooperative also earned 4,000 yuan. At the same time, the cultivated land yielded an additional 20 dan of wheat and 30 dan of autumn grain in the second year (1946). Under the promotion of the cooperative, the number of livestock in the village increased from 47 to 91 in 1946, including 15 purchased directly with the help of the cooperative.

　　In 1945, the cooperative inspected the cotton harvest and found that the average yield was only 33 jin per mu (using a 24-liang scale), so the masses were not enthusiastic about the government's call to plant more cotton. After research, the cooperative found that the low cotton yield was due to poor seeds. The cooperative called on the masses to adjust good seeds and purchased good seeds to exchange for the masses, totaling 4,000 jin of good seeds for planting more than 1,000 mu. As a result, the 1,200 mu of cotton fields in the village yielded an additional 4 jin of cotton per 100 jin in the same year (1946), totaling more than 2,000 jin. In the spring of 1946, the agricultural mutual aid group held a meeting to discuss how to save labor and money and solve the difficulty of agricultural tools, and requested the cooperative to solve this problem. After accepting the task and requirements given by the masses, the cooperative counted that the village was short of 70 agricultural tools, requiring 200 jin of iron. It then purchased iron and handed it over to Xiazhuang Village to make, but only 40 pieces were made, which was not enough. After the autumn harvest, the cooperative established an iron furnace in the village, and in the spring of 1947, when there was a lot of rain and the ground was wet and could not be worked, it organized more than 60 people to reclaim 170 mu of wasteland, which yielded 34 dan of grain in the autumn.

　　In May 1947, the cooperative took stock of the accumulated fertilizer. Among the 32 qing and 7 mu of land in the village, 12 qing were wheat fields, and the manure was only enough for 6 qing. Therefore, it launched a movement to cut artemisia, dig raw soil, and irrigate with manure, resulting in an additional 3 qing of land being fertilized. Later, after the cooperative calculated, 15 loads of manure per mu required 5 workdays to collect one load. Fertilizing 12 qing of wheat fields would require 5,000 workdays. Therefore, it was considered necessary to establish an oil mill. The oil mill employed three people and worked for seven months a year, requiring only 630 workdays. In addition, the village's cotton could produce 49,600 jin of cottonseed, and hemp could produce about 20,000 jin, which could produce 60,000 jin of oil cake, which could solve the shortage of fertilizer. After such precise calculations, the masses' thinking was cleared, and an oil mill and a cotton gin were established. There are now two cotton gins and one cotton carding machine, which are beneficial to textile production, increase oil production and fertilizer accumulation, and solve the needs of the farmers.

　　III. Supporting Textile Production and Small-Scale Cooperative Movements

　　In the winter of 1944 and the following spring, the cooperative organized eight textile groups with 85 women. It borrowed 1,100 jin of cotton from the county cooperative, and including the cotton in the village, it lent a total of 1,800 jin to the women. As a result, the women earned 23,400 jin of rice in wages, 13 jin of rice per jin of cotton. Later, it organized the weaving of military cloth for the supply department, but the women were unwilling to do it because the wages were low. The cooperative used accounting methods to explain and mobilize the women. The village was short of 52,000 jin of grain. If the 2,400 jin of military cloth were completed, it could buy 36,000 jin of rice; otherwise, they would have to go hungry. This mobilized 144 women in the village to complete the task and used the commission from the cotton loan as a reward fund. The first prize was 3,000 yuan for textile models, and it was stated that the next reward would be 5,000 yuan. This improved the women's enthusiasm, and the military cloth task was completed in three months, and more than 1,000 jin were woven, earning a total of 409,600 yuan. At the then market price, this could buy 31,200 jin of millet, supplementing the shortage in agricultural production.

　　Secondly, in order to organize winter production during the agricultural slack season and supplement the shortage of agricultural products, the cooperative used accounting methods to mobilize the masses. The village's cotton production, in addition to the 5 jin needed per person (723 people in the village), could also have a surplus of more than 20,000 jin, which could make up for the shortage of 89,000 jin of millet, so the whole village could have enough to eat. However, the village's expenses for fuel, oil, salt, and dyes amounted to more than 730,000 yuan, which had not yet been settled, leaving a gap. After this calculation, the cadres and the masses became clear-headed. The cooperative used 100,000 yuan to help organize five or six small cooperatives, including a woodworking factory, a hemp gin, a sheep-buying and herding cooperative, a firewood-cutting cooperative, a brick-burning shop, and a mill.

　　Up to around the time of the Second Taihang Regional People's Heroes Conference in 1946, the Nanhedi Cooperative, due to its correct business direction, good connection with mass production, and the mass line leadership method of Comrade Zhang Xigui, expanded from an initial capital of 2 yuan to 960,000 yuan, with 353 members. It had oil mills, blacksmith shops, cotton gins, and retail departments. Since then, the past council system has been reformed, and nine people elected by the members' congress have formed a cooperative committee, which has determined the division of labor and meeting system within the cooperative.

　　IV. The Creation of the In-Kind Production Credit Department

　　Due to the fluctuating market prices, the production enthusiasm and daily life of the masses were not stable enough, and the Nanhedi Cooperative began to explore new paths. Starting in the winter of 1947, a production credit department was established. At that time, the biggest difficulty for the masses was the lack of livestock, which prevented them from engaging in transportation. Zhang Xigui went to the bank to borrow money, but the bank's loans had all been lent out; even if he could get a loan, the amount would be limited and could not solve the problem. He then called on the masses to buy shares and organize a "credit cooperative." However, the masses were unwilling to buy shares because the small cooperatives in the spring had lost money when calculated in kind. Zhang Xigui then carefully studied and proposed the method of "depositing in kind and lending in kind." He discussed it with the village cadres, and everyone agreed. When he publicized the method of depositing in kind to the masses, the masses were also very satisfied. However, they were worried that people would say they had too much grain and that the grain would be controlled and could not be freely used. Comrade Zhang Xigui patiently explained the nature of the credit cooperative and announced two principles: 1. Shareholding and withdrawal of shares are completely voluntary and will never be forced. 2. Interest is also calculated in kind. Dividends are distributed and accounts are settled every three months, with a monthly interest of 1.5 or 2 jin per 100 jin lent. The villagers said, "We can't eat the grain at home, and the rats will spoil it, so it's better to deposit it in the credit cooperative, and we can get some interest." So they all deposited grain. A total of 63 households deposited 1,700 jin of millet and 2,000 jin of corn.

　　When the credit cooperative lent grain out, the masses did not dare to borrow because they had no habit of borrowing grain in the past and were afraid that the price of grain would rise in the future, resulting in a loss. Zhang Xigui organized villagers Liu Niushan, Zhang Dama, and Zhang Sanchou to take the lead in experimenting, and they all made money. Liu Niushan borrowed 100 jin, exchanged it for salt in the city, and then exchanged it for hemp heads. In five days, he earned a net profit of 5,000 yuan in foreign currency after deducting expenses. Under their influence, the masses came to borrow grain. According to six-month statistics, a total of 40 households borrowed grain, lending out 10,085 jin of grain. In three months, all the grain-borrowing households made money, some earning 20,000 or 30,000 yuan, and some earning 60,000 or 70,000 yuan. In this way, the village increased by 21 livestock last year. The credit cooperative distributed dividends on time, and after the autumn harvest, each jin of wheat was given a dividend of 5 jin, so the number of grain depositors also increased. The Zhang Xinyue family alone deposited 500 jin of wheat. Another 2,000 jin of millet and 700 jin of wheat deposited by the cooperative were also completely lent out.

　　Before the autumn harvest, women began to weave, but there was no cotton. The production credit department bought 500 jin of cotton from the county cooperative and lent it to the masses, solving the raw material problem in weaving. In order to improve weaving efficiency, 50 accelerating wheel cars were manufactured, which were well received by the masses.

　　When planting wheat, Zhang Xigui patiently mobilized the masses to strive to apply fertilizer to all the wheat fields. In order to solve the fertilizer difficulty of the masses, the production credit department purchased 5,600 jin of sesame cake and sold it to the masses, and launched a campaign to collect elm tree seeds, with one dou of seeds fertilizing one mu of land. The elm tree seeds alone fertilized 30 mu of land. All of the village's 1,250 mu of wheat fields were fertilized this year. In addition, it also lent cotton, wheat, cash, etc., to several nearby villages.

　　The Nanhedi Production Credit Cooperative can absorb the idle funds of the masses, support the agricultural and sideline production of the masses, and truly achieve mutual benefit for both labor and capital, so it is developing rapidly and has a solid foundation.

　　The experience of the Nanhedi Production Credit Cooperative tells us that the masses are eager to develop production, but they lack capital. Where does the capital come from? There is a lot of idle capital among the masses, and organizing a "production credit cooperative" is the best way to absorb idle capital and invest it in production.

　　The Nanhedi Credit Cooperative should still pay attention to the following: First, it must establish contact with the state-owned economy. Only with the support of the state-owned economy can the credit cooperative develop further and the foundation become more solid. Second, there are supply and marketing factors in the credit cooperative, but they have not been fully utilized. In the future, it should continue to utilize them and turn them into strength, so that the credit cooperative can have a greater future. Third, it should further serve the members and the masses, so that the credit cooperative can be established on a deep-rooted foundation.

　　武安南河底的生产信用合作社
    太行区党委办公室整理
    一、合作社的垮台与整理
    武安县南河底村的合作社是一九四二年十一月灾荒年成立的。当时主要是做些买卖赚几个钱。一九四四年夏收后，社长张喜贵同志接受群众要求，转以扶植群众生产为方针，遇事和干部群众商量着干，便逐渐获得群众拥护。
    二、合作事业与农副业的结合
    一九四五年夏收后，合作社收买了七千斤煤，廉价出售给群众，解决了夏锄农忙时期的燃料困难，节省了工，用到锄苗上。当年七月，合作社发现了人拉犁耕耘的田禾长的不很好，显然秋后收成要减少，就和群众商量，由合作社抽出一万四千元买了四头牛，配置两犋犁，代耕麦田二百一十亩，秋垡二百亩，给贫苦军属应代耕的地不要钱，给贫农代耕每亩十元，给中农代耕每亩十五元，结果代耕的地，合计比市价省一万六千元，合作社还赚了四千元。同时代耕的土地，在第二年（一九四六年）麦秋多收二十大石，秋田多收三十大石。在合作社推动下，一九四六年全村由四十七头牲口增加到九十一头，其中经合作社直接帮买的有十五头。
    一九四五年合作社检查了棉花收成，平均每亩只收三十三斤（二十四两秤），因此群众对政府号召多种棉花情绪不高；经合作社研究，棉花产量低，是因种籽不好，合作社一面号召群众调剂好籽，一面收买好籽换给群众，共计连调剂带换回四千斤好籽，种植一千余亩，结果全村一千二百亩棉田，当年（一九四六年）每百斤多出花四斤，总计多出二千多斤。一九四六年春农业互助组开会，讨论了如何省工省钱又能解决农具的困难，给合作社提出要求，要合作社解决这个问题。合作社接受了群众给的任务和要求后，统计了一下，全村共缺农具七十件，需铁二百斤，于是收买了铁，交给下庄村去打造，结果只打成四十件，赶不上用。秋后合作社就在本村建立了一座铁炉，又在一九四七年春雨多，地湿不能上地的空隙中，组织了六十多人开荒一百七十亩，秋收谷子三十四大石。
    一九四七年五月，合作社把积肥统计了一下，全村三十二顷零七亩土地中，十二顷麦田，粪只够上六顷。因此就发动割蒿、刨生土灌粪运动，结果又多上了三顷地的肥料。以后经合作社计算了一下，每亩地上十五驮粪，拾粪一驮，须用工五个。十二顷麦田的肥料，就得五千个工。于是认为有成立油房的必要。油房用上三个人，一年干上七个月，才费工六百三十个，另外全村棉花能出花籽四万九千六百斤，大麻约出两万斤，二者即可出油饼六万斤，即能解决了肥料的不足。经过这样的精确计算，打通了群众思想，并设了油房，又填设了花房。现有轧花车两个，弹花车一个，这样即有利于纺织，又增加了打油积肥，解决了农民的需要。
    三、扶助纺织与小型合作运动
    一九四四年冬及次年春，合作社组织了八个纺织小组，有八十五个纺妇，向县联社贷花一千一百斤，连本村花在内，共贷给纺妇一千八百斤，结果，纺花赚工资米二万三千四百斤，每斤工资米十三斤。以后又组织给供给部纺织军布，妇女嫌工资低，不愿干，合作社又用算帐的方法，向妇女解释动员，全村缺粮食五万二千斤，若把二千四百斤的军布完成，即能购米三万六千斤，否则自己就得挨饿，这样便动员了全村一百四十四个纺妇来完成这个任务。并用贷花手续费做为奖励基金。第一次奖给纺织模范者三千元，并申明下次还要奖励，奖金为五千元，这样提高了纺妇的情绪，三个月完成了军布任务，并继续多纺织了一千多斤，共赚钱四十万九千六百元。按当时市价能买三万一千二百斤小米，补助了农业生产上的不足。
    其次，为了组织农闲冬季生产，补助农产的不足，合作社用算帐方法动员群众，全村棉花产量，除每人（全村七百二十三人）需用五斤外，还可剩余两万多斤，能弥补八万九千斤小米的不足，这样全村可以够吃。但是全村烧的和油盐染料等项开支，约需七十三万余元，还没有着落，是个空子。经过这样计算，清醒了干部与群众的头脑。合作社用十万资金，帮助组织了五六个小型合作社。计有开木厂一个，麻轧花一个，买卖羊群踩圈的一个，割柴的一个，烧砖开店开磨房等。
    截至一九四六年太行二届群英会前后，南河底合作社由于营业方向正确，与群众生产联系得好，加上张喜贵同志群众路线的领导方法，合作社由成立时的二元资金扩大到九十六万元，社员达到三百五十三人。开设有油坊、铁匠炉、花房及门市部等。从此改造了过去的理事会制度，由社员大会选出九人，组成了合作委员会，并确定了社内的分工及会议等制度。
    四、实物生产信用部的创造
    由于市场物价时涨时落，群众的生产情绪及日常生活不够稳定，南河底合作社又开始摸索新的道路。一九四七年冬开始，又有生产信用部的创立。当时群众最大的困难是没有牲口，不能搞运输。张喜贵便到银行去贷款，但银行的贷款都贷下去了；即使贷上，款数也有限，解决不了问题，他便号召群众入股，组织“信用社”。但群众因春天的小型社按实物计算赔了钱，不愿入股，张喜贵便用心研究，提出了“存实物贷实物”的办法。和村干部研究，大家都很同意。向群众宣传存实物的办法，群众也很满意。但顾虑是怕人家说自己粮食多，怕把粮食管制起来不能自由。张喜贵同志耐心解释，说明信用社的性质，并宣布两条：一、入股抽股完全自愿，绝不强迫。二、利息也以实计算。三个月分红结帐一次，贷百斤月息一斤半或二斤。村民说：“粮食在家吃不着，老鼠还糟踏，不如存到信用合作社，多少还能得个利。”于是都纷纷存粮。计有六十三户，存入小米一千七百斤，玉米两千斤。
    信用社往外贷粮时，群众因过去没有贷粮的习惯，不敢贷，怕现在贷上将来粮食涨价，赔钱，张喜贵便又组织村民刘牛山、张大马、张三丑三人带头试验，结果都赚了钱。刘牛山贷来一百斤，到城里换成盐，又换成麻头，来回五天，除吃用开支外，净赚洋五千元。在他们影响下，群众都来贷粮了。据六个月统计，贷粮者共四十户，贷出粮一万零八十五斤。在三个月中，各贷粮户都赚了钱，有赚两三万或六七万的不等。这样，去年全村增加了二十一头牲口，信用社按时分红，秋后每斤麦子分红五斤，因之入粮户也增加了。村民张心月一户就入麦子五百斤。又吸收了两千斤小米，及合作社存的七百斤麦子，也完全贷出去了。
    秋前妇女纺织开始了，但没有棉花，生产信用社即到县联社购买棉花五百斤，贷给群众，解决了纺织中的原料问题。为了提高纺织效率，又制造加速轮车五十辆，群众颇为欢迎。
    种麦时，张喜贵耐心动员群众争取麦地都要上粪。生产信用社为了解决群众肥料困难，收买麻饼五千六百斤，卖给群众，并发动打椿树籽，一斗籽能上地一亩，光椿树籽即上地三十亩。全村麦地一千二百五十亩，今年全部都上了肥料。另外还贷给附近数村棉花麦子现款等。
    南河底的生产信用社能吸收群众的游资，扶植群众农副业生产，真正做到劳资两利，所以发展很快，而且基础稳固。
    南河底生产信用社的经验告诉我们：群众要求发展生产很迫切，但资本缺乏；资本从哪里来呢？群众中的游资很多，组织“生产信用社”就是吸收游资投入生产的最好形式。
    南河底信用社目前仍应注意的：第一、是必须与国营经济取得联系。只有得到国营经济的扶助，信用社才能进一步的发展，基础才能更坚固。第二、信用社内存在着供销因素，但发挥不够，今后应继续发挥它，使之变为力量，才能使信用社发展前途更远大。第三、更进一步的为社员群众服务，使信用社建立在根深蒂固的基础上。
