Criticism and Suggestions

　　Please Be More Careful, Yi County Post Office
    Dear Editors:
    We have a suggestion:
    The Yi County Post Office is not careful enough in forwarding letters. One of our comrades is from Sanhe Village, Fourth District, Yi County. When he wrote a letter home, the envelope clearly stated "Zhang Luoxiang, Sanhe Village, Fourth District, Yi County, to be received," but the county post office did not look carefully at the recipient's address and mailed the letter to the Third District (probably mistaking "Sanhe" for something similar). After investigation, the Third District found that there was no Sanhe Village, so they wrote "This village is in the Fourth District" on the back of the original letter and returned it to the Yi County Post Office. The post office did not pay attention to the note on the back and returned the letter to the troop. Another letter was returned in a similar situation. We hope that in the future, comrades in the post office will improve their sense of political responsibility so that the letters of the soldiers can be delivered smoothly. Many comrades in the army have written letters home but have not received replies. Of course, this cannot be said to be entirely due to the comrades in the post office, but based on the above situation, we believe that it is more or less related.

### 请易县邮局更细心些

专栏：批评与建议

　　请易县邮局更细心些编辑同志：
    我们有一个建议：
    易县邮局转送信件太不注意。我们有一位同志是易县四区三合庄村人，他写信回乡时，信封上明明写着“易县四区三合庄村张洛相收”，但该县邮局不看清楚收信人地址，而将该信邮到三区（大概是将三合庄看错了），三区经查明没有三合庄村，就在原信背面批上“此村在四区”，而将原信退回易县邮局，该邮局又不注意看背面的批字，而将此信退回到部队来了。另外一封信也在类似的情况下打了回来。我们希望今后邮局同志应提高政治责任心，使战士们的家信能够顺利地寄到。现部队里很多同志都写了家信没得到回复，当然这不能说是由于邮局同志们所造成，但以上述情况来说，我们认为或多或少总是有些关系的。
