　　Former Kuomintang Soldiers Joining Our Army
    Class Consciousness Begins to Improve
  　Determined to Make Meritorious Contributions for the People Through Revolution
    【Xinhua News Agency, Peiping, 10th】Former Kuomintang soldiers who have joined the People's Liberation Army in the Peiping-Tientsin area have initially raised their class consciousness through political rectification and are determined to carry the revolution through to the end in the People's Liberation Army. When the commanders and fighters of the People's Liberation Army educated them, they used a comparative approach, first asking about their family circumstances and how they were forced into the army, and then asking about the relationship between officers and soldiers and between the army and the people in the Kuomintang army, what kind of life they lived in the Kuomintang army, and for whom they fought when they served in the Kuomintang army. On the other hand, they introduced the situation of the PLA soldiers' families being allocated land and receiving preferential treatment from the government, the voluntary participation of young and middle-aged peasants who had turned over a new leaf in the army, and the relationship between officers and soldiers and between the army and the people in the PLA, and the purpose of the People's Liberation War was to liberate the people, and so on. This enlightened the class feelings and political awakening of the new fighters. They angrily denounced the facts that landlords, bureaucrats, and reactionary armies harmed themselves and their families. Luo Ruiyuan, a fighter liberated from Huailai, couldn't help but burst into tears when he told how he was kidnapped into the army by the Kuomintang and how his mother died tragically. A fighter liberated from the 13th Army drew his past persecution and suffering by the landlord into comic strips and posted them on the wall newspaper, so that everyone would know his suffering. After giving them cordial comfort, the old comrades of the People's Liberation Army studied with them the root causes of their past poor lives, calculated the detailed accounts of the landlords exploiting their labor, and discussed the questions of "Who is the common enemy of the suffering people?" "Why does the Kuomintang reactionary group persecute us?" etc., and then linked it to the current situation, exposing the Kuomintang reactionaries' false peace conspiracy. At this point, everyone knew that the people's suffering could not be relieved unless the reactionary forces were eliminated, and they realized that joining the People's Liberation Army was a glorious task. The fighters liberated from a certain company generally wrote letters home, telling their relatives the good news that they had joined the People's Liberation Army. Comrade Du Cunxin of a certain class said in a letter to his father: "Only by being a soldier of the Liberation Army can we avenge ourselves. Now I know that if we don't overthrow the Kuomintang reactionary forces, we can't live and work in peace even if we return home." Yang Xiuchang, a fighter liberated from Yixian, said: "In the team led by the Communist Party, I spit out the bitterness that I couldn't spit out in the past and brightened my eyes. From now on, I must make meritorious contributions for the people."

　　参加我军的前国民党军士兵
    阶级觉悟开始提高
  　决心革命为民立功
    【新华社北平十日电】已在平津地区参加人民解放军的前国民党军士兵，在政治整训中初步提高了阶级觉悟，决心在解放军中革命到底。解放军的指战员们向他们进行教育时，是用对比的方式，首先问他们的家庭情况和被抓当兵的经过，再问国民党军队里的官兵关系、军民关系、他们在国民党军队中过着怎样的生活，以及干国民党军队是为谁打仗等。另一面则介绍解放军战士的家中分得了土地、受到政府优待的情形，翻了身的青壮年农民自愿参军的情形，和解放军里的官兵关系、军民关系、以及人民解放战争的目的是为了解放人民等等。这样便启发了新战士们的阶级感情和政治觉醒。他们纷纷愤激地控诉大地主、官僚、反动军队残害自己及家庭的事实。从怀来解放过来的战士罗瑞原诉说自己被国民党绑去当兵、母亲悲惨死去的情形时，不禁痛哭失声。一个从十三军解放来的战士，把自己过去所受大地主的迫害和痛苦画成了连环画，贴在墙报上，让大家知道他的受难情形。解放军的老同志们给予他们亲切的抚慰后，和他们一起研究过去生活贫苦的根源，计算了大地主剥削他们劳动力的细帐，讨论了“受苦人的共同仇人是谁？”“为什么国民党反动集团迫害我们？”等问题，又联系到目前形势，揭穿了国民党反动派的假和平阴谋。至此，大家知道了反动势力不消灭，人民的痛苦决不能解除，并认识了参加解放军是一个光荣的工作。某连解放来的战士普遍写信回家，为自己参加了人民解放军而向亲人报喜，某班杜存信同志给他父亲的信上说：“只有当了解放军才能报仇，而今知道不打倒国民党反动势力，就是回了家也不能安居乐业。”义县解放来的战士杨秀昌说：“我在共产党领导的队伍里吐出了过去不能吐的苦水，擦亮了我的眼睛，此后一定要为人民立功。”
