　　Traffic Police Must Fulfill Their Duties

  　Please relevant authorities take note, Editor Comrade:
    Recently, on some traffic crossroads in Ping City, traffic police officers are often absent from their posts, often causing traffic order to fall into chaos. There are also some intersections where, although traffic police are present, they sometimes leave their posts to stand on the sidewalk and chat with people, neglecting to direct traffic and forgetting their responsibilities. This situation has a direct impact on the safety of vehicles and pedestrians.
    A few days ago, when I was driving through the intersection in front of Jingshan (East) Street, because there was no traffic police officer to direct traffic, I almost collided with another vehicle. While trying to let each other pass, we almost ran over a pedestrian.
    For the safety of vehicles and pedestrians, I have the following suggestions:
    (1) Traffic police officers at important intersections must not leave their posts without authorization during their duty hours.
    (2) The garrison military police and all traffic police officers should order vehicles (cars) exceeding the speed limits in the city to stop at any time and place, and advise the drivers.
    (3) Traffic police officers on duty should constantly direct pedestrians, bicycles, and pedicabs to stay close to the right side of the road to avoid obstructing the passage of cars and prevent accidental dangers. I request that you forward the above three points to the Municipal Public Security Bureau for careful deployment of officers, strengthened organizational discipline education, and orders to all traffic police officers to strictly adhere to their duties.

### 交通警察须克尽职责　请有关当局注意

　　交通警察须克尽职责
  　请有关当局注意编者同志：
    最近平市有些交通要道的指挥岗亭上，往往不见有交通警员，以致常使交通秩序陷于混乱。还有些道口虽有交通警员，但有时却离开岗位，而站在人行道旁与人闲聊，对车辆通过时不予指挥，竟忘其本身所负的责任。象这样情形，对行车和行人的安全是有切肤关系的。
    前几天我开车经过景山前（东）街的岔道口时，因为没有交通警员指挥行车，我几乎和别的车辆互撞，因为互相让车又几乎碾伤行人。
    为了行车行人的安全，我有以下几点建议：
    （一）各重要道口之交通警员，在值岗时间内，不能擅自脱离指挥岗位。
    （二）卫戍纠察队及各交通警员，对超市区规定行车速率之车辆（汽车）应随时随地责令其停车，对其驾驶者应进行劝告。
    （三）对往来行人自行车及三轮车等，值岗交通警员应随时指挥他们靠近路右边行走，以免妨碍汽车行驶，避免发生意外危险。以上三点请代转本市公安局周密布置岗警，加强组织纪律教育，并饬令各交通警员严格职守。
