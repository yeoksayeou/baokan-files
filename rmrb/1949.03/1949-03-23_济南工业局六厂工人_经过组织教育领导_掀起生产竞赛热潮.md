Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, 18th. Workers in the six factories of the Jinan Industrial Bureau, under the leadership, organization, and education of the People's Government since May, have significantly improved their level of awareness and have recently launched a production emulation upsurge. Before the "February 7th" Memorial Day, workers in the First Factory's lathe department produced approximately 50 large finished products, 90 second-class finished products, and 30 other finished products per person in eight hours. After the holiday, working ten hours a day, they produced approximately 100 large finished products, 140 second-class finished products, and 50 others, while maintaining the original quality. After receiving a certain task in the middle of last month, workers at the Second Factory all chose to do the most difficult repairs. Some, originally requiring two people to repair, volunteered to do it alone. The factory organized its forces, assigned work, and formulated competition plans based on the strengths of the employees' skills and the condition of the tools, emphasizing individual responsibility and close coordination between departments. As a result, in addition to completing the established number of pieces within the time limit, they exceeded it by 27 pieces. After the "February 7th" Festival, 66 female workers in a certain department of the Third Factory rapidly increased production. For example, for a certain finished product, calculated at eight hours per person, 1,200 pieces were rolled in January, and 1,700 pieces were rolled in February. Recently, they have automatically increased their working hours by two hours per day, and the output has more than doubled, that is, 3,700 pieces can be rolled every day. In the Fourth Factory, during the competition, it was found that the distribution of manpower was inappropriate and the coordination between work departments was poor, so adjustments were made immediately, and work efficiency was improved. The steelmaking team of the Fifth Factory used to melt 1,200 jin per furnace per day, but recently increased it to 2,000 jin. The engineering staff is also actively grasping the temperature of the steelmaking to ensure quality. A production increase plan for March, aiming to complete the total production of the past four months, has been jointly formulated by the factory and its employees. Many methods for adjusting forces, improving tools, and improving work systems have been studied, giving confidence to a few employees who were worried about not being able to complete the task. The Sixth Factory's shock plan has also been formulated, and new workers will be recruited to expand work.

　　济南工业局六厂工人
    经过组织教育领导
    掀起生产竞赛热潮
    【新华社济南十八日电】济市工业局六个厂的工人，经人民政府五月来的领导、组织与教育，觉悟程度显著提高，最近掀起了生产竞赛热潮。一厂车工部工人在“二七”纪念节前每人八小时出大成品约五十个，二等成品约九十个，其他成品约三十个。节日后每天十小时，出大成品约百个，二等成品约一百四十个，其他五十个，并且保持了原有的质量。二厂自上月中旬接到某种任务后，工人们都挑最难修理的活干，本来要两个人修的，有些都自报独自修。厂方即按职工技术强弱和工具情形，组织力量，分配工作，各组又具体分工，订出竞赛计划，著重个人负责与部门间的密切配合。这样，在限期内除完成既定件数外，并超过二十七件。三厂某部六十六名女工在“二七”节后迅速增产，如某种成品按每人八小时计，一月份轧一千二百个，二月份即轧一千七百个，最近更自动每天增加工作二小时，产量已超过一倍，即每天可轧三千七百个。四厂在竞赛中，发现人力分配不适当，工作部门与部门间配合不好，立刻进行调整，工作效率就提高了。五厂化钢组以前每盘炉日化一千二百斤，最近增至二千斤，工务员并积极的掌握化钢热度，保证质量。日前厂方并与职工拟定了三月份完成过去四个月生产总数的增产计划，并研究出许多调整力量、改良工具、改进工作制度等办法，使少数怀着完不成任务的职工也有了信心。六厂的突击计划亦已订出，且将增收新工人以扩展工作。
