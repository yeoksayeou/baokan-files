　　Short Comments
　　　　Grasp Large-Scale Production

　　It is essential to pay attention to the seasons and shift to production without missing the farming season. This is an issue that leaders in the new areas should pay close attention to. As far as we know, many areas are still engaged in equal distribution or ending land reform, just like the work teams in some villages of Laiyuan and Zhuozhou, clinging to land reform and forgetting about this year's large-scale production movement. They have forgotten that the farmers' urgent need is to prepare for spring plowing. Even if it is necessary to solve some remaining issues of land reform, it must start from meeting the farmers' most urgent needs. They believe that spring plowing does not need leadership, while land reform needs to be "handled carefully." Some cadres even think that engaging in land reform can "improve" themselves, while engaging in spring plowing has no "flavor." This kind of thinking completely violates the North China Bureau's policy of carrying out a large-scale production movement and neglects the demands of the masses, which is extremely wrong. Now that spring plowing is approaching, all work must revolve around large-scale production. Anything that hinders spring plowing and production must be resolutely stopped. Party leaders in various regions should make up their minds, firmly grasp the season, and concentrate all their efforts on launching a large-scale production movement.

　　　　Have Closer Ties with Workers

　　The Shijiazhuang Daily's convening of a meeting of representatives of communication groups from public enterprises to review the newspaper's connection with workers is a very good experience. In urban work, the Party newspaper must first and foremost resolutely rely on the working class. Currently, the biggest shortcoming in our reporting is the lack of in-depth understanding of workers' lives. The newspaper extremely lacks news and communications that systematically introduce workers in various industries, and rarely sees a large number of workers' opinions and voices. The Shijiazhuang Daily's review believes that the class viewpoint of journalists is not clear, which is completely correct. Many of our reporters only like to chase after some fragmented news, floating on the upper level, and do not know how to make friends with workers. They like to report on meetings and do not write about the lives and struggles of the people, especially the workers. They can write things summarized by the leadership, but they cannot extract materials from actual life for analysis and synthesis, and propose solutions to problems. The same situation exists in editorial work. The key to solving this problem is to strengthen the education of the class viewpoint of journalists. The Shijiazhuang Daily's convening of a meeting of representatives of communication groups from public enterprises is a relatively good method, which can be appropriately adopted by Party newspapers in various cities.

　　三言两语
            抓住大生产
    必须注意季节，不误农时地转入生产，这在新区是一个值得领导上十分注意的问题。据我们所知，现在有很多地区还在搞平分或结束土改，象涞涿某些村庄工作组一样，死死抓住土改不放，忘掉了今年的大生产运动，忘掉了目前农民的迫切要求是准备春耕，即使须要解决土改若干遗留问题，也必须从满足农民最迫切的要求入手，他们认为春耕不必领导，土改则须要“把着干”。甚至有些干部认为搞土改可以锻炼自己“进步”，搞春耕没有“味道”。这种思想，根本违背了华北局开展大生产运动的方针，忽视了群众要求，是十分错误的。现在春耕迫近，一切工作必须围绕大生产来进行，凡是妨碍春耕生产的事情均须坚决地停止下来，各地党的领导者应下定决心，毫不动摇地掌握季节，集中全力，开展大生产运动。
    　　　　和工人联系的更紧些
    石家庄日报召集公营企业通讯组代表会议检讨报纸同工人的连系，是一个很好的经验。党报在城市工作中必须首先坚决依靠工人阶级。目前我们报导的最大的缺点也正是深入工人生活不够，报上极端缺少系统介绍各业工人的新闻通讯，也很少看到大量的工人意见和呼声。石家庄日报的检讨认为是新闻工作者阶级观点不明确，是完全正确的。我们有不少记者只喜欢追逐一些零碎新闻，浮于上层，不会同工人交朋友，喜欢报导会议，不会写人民特别是工人的生活和斗争，能写领导上总结起来的东西，不会从实际生活中汲取材料进行分析综合，提出问题解决问题。编辑工作上也同样存在上述情况，解决这一问题的关键是加强新闻工作者阶级观点的教育，石家庄日报召开公营企业通讯组代表会议是其中较好的一个方法，各城市党报均可适当采用。
