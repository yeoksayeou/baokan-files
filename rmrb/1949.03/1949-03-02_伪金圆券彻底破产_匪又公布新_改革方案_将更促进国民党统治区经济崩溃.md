　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 28th. Due to the complete collapse of the fake Gold Yuan, the fleeing Executive Yuan of the Kuomintang reactionary traitorous government passed a "Financial Reform Plan" in Guangzhou on the 23rd, which was announced by Xu Kan, the fake Minister of Finance, in Guangzhou on the 24th. This so-called "reform plan" on the one hand formally declared the complete bankruptcy of the fake Gold Yuan, and on the other hand attempted to continue to cruelly plunder the people in the Kuomintang-controlled areas and maintain its huge military expenditure through new methods. The main content of this plan includes the following points: First, the salaries and supplementary food expenses of the Kuomintang reactionary army will be calculated in silver dollars. Second, in terms of taxation, import tariffs will be calculated in so-called "Customs Yuan" at a rate of one yuan equals four U.S. cents, imitating the former Customs Gold Unit system. It is stipulated that people must exchange gold, silver, and foreign currency for "Customs Yuan" from the Kuomintang Central Bank, which will be used exclusively for paying customs duties. For commodity taxes on cotton yarn, matches, cement, cigarettes, and sugar, the actual goods will be taxed according to regulations. If it is inconvenient to collect actual goods, the price of the actual goods will be converted into Gold Yuan for payment. In addition to collecting actual goods for salt taxes, it is stipulated that the Kuomintang government "may handle a part of the official collection and transportation." These methods are used to directly plunder money and materials from the people. Third, the Kuomintang "Central Government" will stop subsidizing the finances of provinces, cities, and counties, and will allocate 30% of the original "Central" land tax, opium and liquor tax, and special business tax to local governments, and "relax" the restrictions on local taxation, encouraging the Kuomintang local governments to extract even more fiercely from the people. Fourth, the free trading of silver dollars, gold, and silver is allowed, and the free circulation of silver dollars is permitted.
　　It can be seen from the above provisions that although this "reform plan" of the Kuomintang bandit gang actually cancels the provision made by the Kuomintang government when it "reformed the currency system" on August 19 last year, which took the Gold Yuan as the standard currency, and even the Kuomintang government itself has refused to use it in its main financial revenue and expenditure, knowing that it will soon become waste paper, it still allows it to continue to circulate in the market, allowing the people in the Kuomintang-controlled areas to continue to be plundered by it.
　　Since the Kuomintang "reformed the currency system" and issued the fake Gold Yuan, it has been only half a year. Taking Shanghai as an example, according to official statistics published by the Kuomintang, the general price index in the area had risen by 1,346 times by the 23rd. Compared with the 62-fold increase in Shanghai's prices during the nearly eight months from the beginning of last year to the "currency system reform" in August, when the depreciation of the fake legal tender was the most severe, it can better show how quickly the fake Gold Yuan collapsed and how severe the disaster was. In order to cope with this economic collapse, the Kuomintang bandit gang once again used the name of "reform" to carry out further plunder of the people. Xu Kan, the fake Minister of Finance, deceived the people by saying: "After the new plan is implemented, the issuance of Gold Yuan will be stopped." He also said: "The government will mint a large number of silver dollars as a preparation to stabilize the current Gold Yuan and reissue silver dollars in the future." However, on the second day of the announcement of the "reform plan," the value of the fake Gold Yuan in Shanghai depreciated again in a "dizzying" manner, with the ratio to the U.S. dollar falling from 2,950 yuan to one to 3,700 to one. Rice rose from 12,000 yuan per dan on the 26th to 16,000 yuan. This proves that Xu Kan's words cannot deceive anyone. It can be asserted that this so-called "reform" of the Kuomintang bandit gang will not improve its economic situation in the slightest, but will only further promote the chaos in the economy of the Kuomintang-controlled areas and further promote its collapse. Just like the Kuomintang bandit gang's military and political situation, the Kuomintang bandit gang has already reached the end of its economic rope.

　　伪金圆券彻底破产
    匪又公布新“改革方案”
    将更促进国民党统治区经济崩溃
    【新华社陕北廿八日电】由于伪金圆券的完全崩溃，国民党反动卖国政府的流亡行政院又于二十三日在广州通过了一个“财政金融改革案”，由伪财政部长徐堪二十四日在广州公布。这个所谓“改革方案”，一方面正式宣告了伪金圆券的彻底破产，一方面企图以新的办法继续对国民党统治区人民实行残酷掠夺，维持其庞大的军事开支。这个方案的主要内容包括下列各点：第一，国民党反动军队的薪饷和副食费改以银元为计算标准。第二，税收方面，海关进口税仿照从前海关金单位制，改以每元等于美金四角的所谓“关元”为计算单位，规定人民须以金、银、外币向国民党中央银行兑换“关元”，专充缴纳关税之用。货物税中，棉纱、火柴、水泥、卷烟、食糖等，照规定税照征收实物，不便征收实物者，亦以实物价格折算金圆券缴纳。盐税除征收实物外，并规定国民党政府“得办理一部分官收官运”。用这些办法直接从人民手中掠取金钱、物资。第三，国民党“中央”停止对各省市县财政的补助，将原属“中央”之田赋三成及土烟土酒税、特种营业税划归地方，并“放宽”地方征课税捐之限制，鼓励国民党地方政府更凶狠地榨取人民。第四，允许银元、黄金、白银自由买卖，并准许银元自由流通。
    从上面这些规定中可以看出，国民党匪帮这个“改革方案”，虽然实际上是取消了去年八月十九日国民党政府“改革币制”时所作的以金圆券为本位币的规定，虽然连国民党政府自己的主要财政收支中也已拒绝使用它，明知它会很快成为废纸，但却仍然让它在市面继续流通，让国民党统治区人民继续受它的洗劫。
    自从国民党“改革币制”发行伪金圆券以来，为时不过半年，国民党统治区的物价，以上海为例，据国民党官方发表统计数字，至二十三日为止该地物价总指数即已上涨了一千三百四十六倍。这个倍数，与伪法币贬值最厉害的去年初至去年八月“改革币制”时的近八个月中，上海物价上涨六十二倍相比较，就更能显出伪金圆券崩溃之快，为祸之烈。为了应付这种经济大崩溃的局面，国民党匪帮乃又一次假借“改革”的名义对人民实行其进一步掠夺。伪财政部长徐堪欺骗人民说：“新方案实行后，金圆券即停止发行。”又说：“政府将大量铸造银圆，作为稳定目前金圆券和将来改发银圆的准备”。但就在“改革方案”公布的第二天，伪金圆券又在上海作了“令人晕眩”的贬值，与美金的比值从二千九百五十元比一跌为三千七百比一。大米二十六日则由每担一万二千元上涨为一万六千元。这证明徐堪的话是骗不了任何人的。可以断言，国民党匪帮这个所谓“改革”，不但不会丝毫改善其经济情况，只会是更加促进国民党统治区经济的混乱，更促进它的崩溃。正如同国民党匪帮在军事上和政治上的处境一样，国民党匪帮在经济上也早已山穷水尽了。
