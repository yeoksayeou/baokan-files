[Jinan Telegram] The Handan Municipal People's Government has decided to restore the egg yolk industry and is calling for private investment. Currently, the Tongren Cooperative is taking the lead in preparing for the resumption of operations: surveying factory sites and formulating plans. The new factory's capital is tentatively set at 9 million yuan, with 135 workers. In order to start production as soon as possible, it has been decided to start with manual manufacturing, and then gradually transition to machine manufacturing in a planned way. It is expected to start operations in mid-April. It is understood that there were originally five egg yolk factories in the city, including Yilong, Zhongfu, and Hengyu. Yilong has the longest history, established in the fifth year of the Republic of China (1916), while Hengyu has a larger scale, with a capital of approximately 30 million yuan in Renminbi, 200 workers, and processing 100,000 eggs per day. After the Anti-Japanese War, the Japanese and puppet regime destroyed them, and all factories collapsed. Based on the historical situation of the egg yolk industry in the city, as well as the existing transportation and other conditions, the restoration of this industry will solve the problem of egg sales in large rural areas and provide chemical industrial raw materials to large cities.

　　邯市恢复蛋黄工业
    ……四月中旬可望开工
    【冀南电】邯郸市人民政府决恢复蛋黄工业，并号召私人投资。现正以同仁合作社为首进行复业准备工作：测划厂址，制订计划。新厂资金暂定为九百万元，工人一百三十五人。为谋早日开工，决定先用人工制造，然后有计划地转为机器制造。预计四月中旬即可开工。按该市蛋黄工厂，原有义龙、中孚、恒裕等五家。以义龙历史最久，建立于民国五年，以恒裕规模较大，资金约合人民币三千万元，工人二百名，每日打蛋十万个。抗战以后，日伪摧残，各厂全部垮台。根据该市蛋黄工业历史情况，以及现有交通等条件，该项工业的恢复，将可解决大片乡村的鸡蛋销路问题，并供给大城市以化学工业原料。
