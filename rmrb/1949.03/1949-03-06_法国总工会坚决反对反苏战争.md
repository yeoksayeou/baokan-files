Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 4th. TASS, Paris, February 28th: The National Committee of the French General Confederation of Labor held a meeting. The meeting first heard a report from the General Secretary of the General Confederation of Labor, Le Leap, on the activities of the World Federation of Trade Unions and the struggle to defend peace. In talking about the last meeting of the Executive Bureau and the Executive Committee of the World Federation of Trade Unions, Le Leap mentioned, on the one hand, the willingness to reconcile expressed by the majority, and on the other hand, the efforts of the United States and Britain to undermine the international unity of workers. Le Leap said: The leaders of the Congress of Industrial Organizations in the United States accused the World Federation of Trade Unions of not understanding the "generosity" of the "Marshall Plan" to provide "aid" to Europe. The representative of the CIO, Carey, even insisted that the CIO was the author of the "Marshall Plan." Indeed, the World Federation of Trade Unions is a stumbling block for those who want to pursue reactionary policies and are preparing for a third world war. Le Leap emphasized: "The people of no country in the world want war."

　　The General Secretary of the Miners' Union said at the meeting: The miners fully agree with the talks given by Duclos in the National Assembly.

　　Another General Secretary of the General Confederation of Labor, Frachon, summarized the achievements of the work of the National Committee of the General Confederation of Labor, saying: It is necessary to carry out effective struggles against imperialism, without being affected by threats, clamor, and slander. We declare: We will do everything in our power to prevent the outbreak of a new anti-Soviet war that imperialism is preparing; we declare this, expressing the sentiments of the working people of our country, who are realizing their unity by opposing war and striving to satisfy their demands. Our enemies want to destroy the French General Confederation of Labor, but they have broken their teeth.

　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 4th. According to the Electric Communications Agency, Paris, 1st: The National Committee of the "Warriors for Peace and Freedom Society" has sent a letter to Truman, declaring that the French people oppose joining the North Atlantic Treaty. The letter has been endorsed by tens of thousands of signatures. The letter pointed out: "Our government has hinted that the French people will agree to an anti-Soviet war of aggression under the guise of the Atlantic Treaty. Our government has deceived you. The French Constitution explicitly prohibits France from participating in wars of aggression." The letter pledged allegiance to the United Nations Charter and the Franco-Soviet Alliance Treaty. The letter stated: "We will keep our territory free from use by any foreign country as a base or for stationing troops. We will maintain the freedom not to participate in what we consider to be an evil war."

　　法国总工会坚决反对反苏战争
    【新华社陕北四日电】据塔斯社巴黎二月二十八日讯：法国总工会全国委员会举行会议。会议首先听取了总工会总书记勒里普关于世界工联的活动和保卫和平的斗争的报告。勒里普在谈到世界职工联盟执行局和执委会上次的会议时，提到一方面是大多数所表示的和解的意志，另一方面是美英破坏工人国际团结的努力。勒里普说：美国产业工会联合会领袖们责备世界工联，说它不了解予欧洲以“援助”的“马歇尔计划”的“慷慨”。产联的代表加莱甚至坚称：产联是“马歇尔计划”的作者。的确，世界工联对于那些想奉行反动政策和正在准备第三次大战的人们说来，是一个绊脚石。勒里普强调指出：“全世界没有一个国家的人民想要战争。”
    矿工工会总书记在会上说：矿工完全同意多列士在国民议会所发表的谈话。
    总工会另一位总书记佛拉商总结总工会全国委员会工作的成果称：必须进行反对帝国主义的有效斗争，而不要受到威胁、叫嚣和诽谤的影响。我们宣告：我们将以一切努力，来防止帝国主义正在准备的新的反苏战争的爆发；我们这样宣告，说出了我国劳动人民的情绪，劳动人民以反对战争和争取满足他们的要求，实现着他们的团结。我们的敌人想破坏法国总工会，但是，它们却碰碎了自己的牙齿。
    【新华社陕北四日电】据电通社巴黎一日讯：“和平与自由战士社”全国委员会，顷致函杜鲁门，声明法国人民反对参加北大西洋公约。该信已有数万人签名拥护。该信指出：“我们的政府曾经暗示：法国人民将同意在大西洋公约掩盖之下的反苏侵略战争。我们的政府骗了你。法国宪法明确禁止法国参加侵略战争。”该信宣誓忠于联合国宪章和法苏同盟条约。该信称：“我们将保持我国领土不供任何外国作基地或驻兵之用。我们将保持不参加我们认为是罪恶战争的自由。”
