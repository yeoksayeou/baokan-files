【Taihang Telegram】After the news that the Zhang Yinwu counter-revolutionary massive military espionage case in Beiping was cracked by the Beiping Municipal People's Government Public Security Bureau reached this area, the Taihang Jixi Special District (First Special District) Commissioner's Office, the CCP First District Committee, the People's Armed Forces Department, the Trade Union, the Women's Federation, the New Democratic Youth League, the Trading Company and other party, government and civil organizations, representing the million people in the Yuan (氏), Gao (邑), Zan (皇), Lin (城), Nei (邱), Xing (台) and Sha (河) areas of Jixi, filed a complaint against traitor Zhang, stating: Zhang Yinwu, in the early autumn of 1939, led his so-called "Hebei People's Army" from the southern Hebei and central Hebei areas to our Jixi, openly colluded with the Japanese invaders, clamoring for "saving the country through a roundabout route," and propagating "anti-communism" and anti-people, and actively cooperated with the Japanese invaders in attacking our Jixi area, brutally murdering the loyal and brave anti-Japanese soldiers and civilians who persisted in this area, and single-handedly creating the massive massacre incidents in Zhongmayu, Zanhuang, Yehuchuan, Neiqiu, Motiangling, Gangdi, and Yuanshi. Wherever Zhang's iron hooves reached, he extorted and assassinated wantonly, causing the people to live in misery and creating a terrifying world in the Jixi area in 1939 where roads were cut off and people were scarce. Looking back now, how long ago it seems, the executioner who poisoned the people has now fallen into the people's net. Now, on behalf of the million people in the Jixi area of the Taihang Liberated Area, we file a complaint, hoping that the highest People's Government of Beiping will give the bloodthirsty demon Zhang Yinwu, who owes the people blood debts, the severe punishment he deserves, in order to relieve the grievances of a million people.

　　元氏等县百万人民要求严惩张逆荫梧
    【太行电】张逆荫梧在北平组织巨大军事特务案，为平市人民政府公安局破获的消息传至此间后，太行冀西专区（一专区）督察专员公署、中共一地委、人民武装部、职工会、妇联会、新民主主义青年团、贸易公司等党政民机关团体组织，代表冀西元（氏）、高（邑）、赞（皇）、临（城）、内（邱）、邢（台）沙（河）地区百万人民，特向张逆提起控诉，控诉书略称：张逆荫梧于一九三九年秋初，率领其所谓“河北民军”由冀南、冀中地区窜抵我冀西后，即公开勾结日寇，大肆叫嚣“曲线救国”，宣传“反共”反人民，并积极配合日寇进攻我冀西地区，惨杀忠勇坚持该地区的抗日军民，一手制造了赞皇中马峪、内邱野虎川、摩天岭、岗底、元氏等巨大惨杀事件。张逆铁蹄所至，大肆勒索暗杀，民不聊生，造成了一九三九年冀西地区路断人稀的恐怖世界。追今思昔，曾几何时，荼毒人民的刽子手今已落入人民法网。现谨代表太行解放区冀西地区百万人民提起控诉，万望北平市最高人民政府给欠有人民血债的杀人魔王张逆荫梧以罪有应得的严惩，以纾百万民冤。
