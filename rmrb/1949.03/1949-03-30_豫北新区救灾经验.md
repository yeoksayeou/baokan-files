Disaster Relief Experience in the Northern Henan New District

	The four counties of Xiuwu, Huojia, Wuzhi, and Jiaozuo in the Fourth Prefecture of Taihang are newly liberated areas with a total population of 439,937, of which 181,729 are disaster victims, accounting for more than 41 percent of the total population of the four counties. The disaster began in July 1947, when the Qin River breached at Dafan Village in Wuzhi. The Kuomintang bandits obstructed the closing of the breach, causing the Qin River to flood. More than 300,000 mu of farmland in the four counties were flooded. Some villages were like islands in the water, and no grain was harvested for three consecutive seasons, causing extreme hardship for the people.

	After the liberation of the area last November, the people's government actively led the masses in production for self-relief. First, work relief was used to close the breach in the Qin River. Starting from the beginning of January this year, disaster victims transported stone and straw materials to the breach closing construction site. In one month, by early February, the masses earned 135,337 jin of wheat from transportation fees alone. In addition, each jin of sorghum stalks (a total of 883,530 jin) was priced at two jin of coal, and the masses exchanged them for a total of more than 1.76 million jin of coal. After deducting what the masses used themselves, it is estimated that more than 1 million jin remained, which could be exchanged for 100,000 jin of wheat. From February 26th, 4,000 disaster victims have been organized to dig diversion canals, repair dikes and build dams, etc., with an average daily wage of five jin of wheat per person. In total, the breach closing project requires about 60,000 laborers, and the masses can earn more than 300,000 jin of wheat.

	After the Dafan breach is closed before the end of March, more than 300,000 mu of cultivated land can be freed up. At least 250,000 mu of autumn crops can be planted this spring, including 110,000 mu in Xiuwu, 100,000 mu in Huojia, 35,000 mu in Wuzhi, and 5,000 mu in Hui County. Assuming a yield of seven dou of grain per mu, the total grain production can be increased by 175,000 shi.

	Secondly, in conjunction with supporting the front lines, the masses were organized to transport coal from the Jiaozuo Coal Mine to the troops. From December last year to March this year, a total of 5.58 million jin of coal were transported to the troops. This time, the Dihua Store organized the masses to transport 600,000 jin of coal to Zhonghe Town in Huojia. The masses earned a total of more than 625,000 jin of wheat. Because Xiuwu suffered the most severe disaster, the county transported the most, accounting for more than 530,000 jin of wheat. In order to take care of the particularly poor disaster victims, it was stipulated that for transporting coal from the Jiaozuo Coal Mine to Xiuwu City, people pushing carts would receive 1.5 liang of wheat for every jin of coal transported, and large carts pulling coal would receive 1.2 liang of wheat for every jin of coal transported. This not only solved the fuel difficulties of the front lines, but also increased a large amount of income for the disaster victims.

	Thirdly, in conjunction with construction, restoring railways, highways, bridges, etc., supports the masses in production to overcome famine. In Xiuwu County alone, the masses received more than 200,000 jin of millet in the form of rewards, purchase prices, and transportation fees issued by the Railway Bureau for paying contributions and transporting railway equipment. The repair of highways was also partly based on work relief, with a total of 11,680 jin of wheat being paid as wages. Because the roads in the flooded areas were quickly organized by the masses to be repaired after the liberation of the new area, and the mass transportation production was launched, many large cart inns, coal yards, and small vendors were restored and newly added along the highways, reaching 276 in Xiuwu alone. The masses in the disaster area unanimously reflected: "Repairing the roads so that transportation is possible is better than the government giving the people two rounds of disaster relief!"

	There are two main experiences in leading the masses in the new district to produce for self-relief during this period.

	First, in the new district with severe disasters, leading the masses in production to overcome famine is the best way to unite and mobilize the masses and can quickly eliminate the remaining forces of the enemy and puppets. For example, in Huojia, through production for self-relief, by December of last year, more than 100 activists had been cultivated in 20 villages, exposing the crimes of the remaining forces of the enemy and puppets and local bullies, and actively connecting the masses, so that the government and the masses were closely linked.

	Second, attention must be paid to grasping and correcting the condescending views that cadres are most likely to produce; otherwise, production for self-relief will not achieve success. (Communication Group of the Cooperative Section of the Fourth Administrative Office of Taihang)

　　豫北新区救灾经验
    太行四专区修武、获嘉、武陟、焦作四县是新解放区，人口共四十三万九千九百三十七人，其中灾民十八万一千七百二十九人，占四县总人口的百分之四十一以上。灾情始于一九四七年七月，当时沁河于武陟大樊村决口，国民党匪帮阻挠堵口，致沁水泛滥成灾。四县被淹耕地三十多万亩，有的村庄如居水岛，一连三季粒米未收，人民生活极苦。
    去年十一月该地区解放后，人民政府积极领导群众生产自救。首先是以工代赈进行堵沁河决口。从今年一月初开始，灾民给堵口工程处运送石料秸料，至二月初，一个月中，仅运费一项，群众即得小麦十三万五千三百三十七斤。此外，每斤高粱杆（共八十八万三千五百三十斤）发价二斤煤，群众共换煤一百七十六万多斤，除群众自用外，估计可余一百万斤，可换小麦十万斤。从二月二十六日起已开始组织灾民四千人挖引河、补堤筑坝等，平均每人每日赚工资小麦五斤。总计堵口工程共需用民工六万左右，群众可赚小麦三十余万斤。
    大樊堵口于三月底前完成后，可空出耕地三十多万亩。今春至少可下种秋苗二十五万亩，计修武十一万亩，获嘉十万亩，武陟三万五千亩，辉县五千亩。每亩以收粮七斗计，共可增产粮食十七万五千石。
    其次是结合支援前线，组织群众从焦作煤矿给部队运煤。从去年十二月至今年三月份共给部队运煤五百五十八万斤。此次大华商店组织群众运往获嘉中和镇煤六十万斤。群众共赚小麦六十二万五千多斤。因修武灾情最为严重，该县运的最多，计可得小麦五十三万余斤。为了照顾特别贫苦的灾民，规定从焦作煤矿运煤到修武城，人推车每推煤一斤发运费小麦一两五钱，大车拉煤一斤发运费小麦一两二钱。这样既解决了前方燃料困难，又使灾民增加了一大笔收入。
    第三是结合建设，恢复铁路公路桥梁等，扶植群众生产渡荒。仅修武一县，群众因缴献、运送铁路器材，即得铁路局所发之奖励金、购价、运费合小米二十万斤以上。修复公路也有一部份是以工代赈，共发工资粮一万一千六百八十斤小麦。由于在新区解放后，即抓紧组织群众修通了泛区的公路，开展了群众的运输生产，因之公路两旁恢复与新增了大车店、煤厂、小摊贩甚多，仅修武境内即达二百七十六座。灾区群众一致反映：修通路能运输了，比政府给老百姓放两次赈还强！
    在这段领导新区群众生产自救中有两个主要经验。
    第一、在灾情严重的新区，领导群众生产渡荒是团结、发动群众的最好方式，能很快的肃清敌伪残余势力。如获嘉通过生产渡荒，至去年十二月份时已在二十个村培养了一百多个积极分子，揭发了敌伪残余、地主恶霸分子的罪恶，并积极串连群众，使政府与群众密切联系起来。
    第二、必须注意抓紧纠正干部最容易产生的恩赐观点，否则，生产自救就不会做出成绩。（太行四专署合作科通讯小组）
