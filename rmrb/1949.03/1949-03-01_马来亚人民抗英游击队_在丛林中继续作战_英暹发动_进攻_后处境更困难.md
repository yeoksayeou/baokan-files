Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 26th. Despite launching a so-called "largest offensive" on the 9th against the Malayan People's Anti-British Guerrilla Force on the Siamese-Malayan border in collusion with the Siamese fascist government, British reactionaries have failed to improve Britain's difficult situation in Malaya. According to an Agence France-Presse dispatch from Singapore on the 18th, "Malayan political and military leaders, in recent talks, have expressed very little hope for an improvement in the situation." British High Commissioner for Malaya, Gurney, said ruefully, "The problem remains serious." He also revealed that the so-called "Federation of Malaya" authorities have requested the British government to finance military expenses against the Malayan people. This expense already requires the "Federation of Malaya" to pay 35,000 pounds daily. British Major General Dunlop, commander of British forces in the Singapore area, revealed that the People's Anti-British Guerrilla Force in Johor, southern Malaya, is continuing to fight against the British army in the jungle. The guerrillas are adopting tactics of dispersing into smaller units and frequently "ambushing" the colonialists. On the Siamese side, after the Luan Phibuns government openly participated in the imperialist British offensive against the Malayan people, its fascist rule has become increasingly unstable. On the 23rd, Luan Phibuns signed a "martial law" decree, declaring a nationwide "state of emergency," and is about to implement new censorship of newspapers "published in any language" to prevent the leakage of information unfavorable to the Siamese authorities. The internal factional contradictions within the Luan Phibuns government are also intensifying. On the same day (9th) that the Siamese army began its offensive against the Malayan guerrillas, an incident occurred in Bangkok in which the army and navy took precautionary measures against each other, causing a period of political tension in Bangkok (Agence France-Presse). The London Times also stated on the 19th that "Due to disgruntled factions in the army, Luan Phibuns' position is weaker today than before."

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 26th. According to an Agence France-Presse dispatch from London: The British magazine "New Statesman and Nation" recently expressed pessimism when discussing the prospects of the British army's operations against the people's guerrillas in Malaya. The magazine stated that the expectation that the guerrillas "would be wiped out within a few months has been denied." "Unexpected incidents" continue to occur. The magazine admitted that most overseas Chinese are still unwilling to cooperate with the British authorities. The magazine pointed out that the British authorities' massacre of innocent overseas Chinese residents in Batu Arang and Kalis "has increased the people's sympathy for the guerrillas." The magazine concluded that the future of Britain's protracted and fruitless war in Malaya is bleak.

  　在丛林中继续作战
    英暹发动“进攻”后处境更困难
    【新华社陕北二十六日电】英国反动派勾结暹罗法西斯政府，于九日对暹罗马来亚边境的马来亚人民抗英游击队发动所谓“最大的一次进攻”以后，仍未能改善英国在马来亚的困难处境。据法新社新加坡十八日电称：“马来亚政界及军界领袖在近来的谈话中，都表示对于情势的改进抱极少希望”。英驻马来亚高级专员格尔奈懊丧地说，“问题仍然严重”。他又透露，所谓“马来亚联邦”当局，已要求英政府资助反马来亚人民的军事费用。这笔费用已使“马来亚联邦”每日须付出三万五千英磅。新加坡区英军司令登洛普少将透露，马来亚南部柔佛州的人民抗英游击队，正在丛林中继续对英军作战。游击队采取化整为零的战术，并经常予殖民者以“伏击”。暹罗方面，銮披汶政府在公开参加英帝国主义对马来亚人民的进攻后，其法西斯统治已日趋不稳。二十三日，銮披汶签署“戒严”令，宣布全国处于“紧急状态”，并即将实施其对“不论以何种文字出版”的报纸的新闻检查，以防不利于暹罗当局之消息的泄露。銮披汶政府内部派系的矛盾，亦在加剧。与暹军开始进攻马来亚游击队同一天（九日），曼谷海陆军之间曾发生了互相采取防范措施的事件，使曼谷政治空气一度紧张（法新社）。伦敦泰晤士报十九日亦称：“由于军队中有心怀不满的派系，銮披汶今天的地位已较前削弱了。”
    【新华社陕北廿六日电】据法新社伦敦讯：英国“新政治家与民族”杂志，日前在论及英军在马来亚对人民游击队作战的前途时，表示悲观。该杂志称：游击队“在数月内被剿清的预料，已被否定”。“意外事件”继续发生。该杂志承认：大多数华侨仍不愿与英国当局合作。该杂志指出：英国当局在巴丹与卡里屠杀无辜华侨居民的事件，“已增加了人民对游击队的同情”。该杂志的结语认为：英国在马来亚绵延无结果的战争，前途是可悲的。
