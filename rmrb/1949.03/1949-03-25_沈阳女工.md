　　Shenyang Female Workers
    After liberation, the female workers of Shenyang City engage in production with a new labor attitude in public enterprises, so the production efficiency is increasing day by day, and their lives have also been improved.
    In the many military supply factories in Shenyang, such as clothing and rubber factories, the production tasks are often heavy and need to be completed within a time limit. In production, female workers not only do not lag behind male workers, but some even exceed male workers in quantity and quality. They say: Our happiness is given by the Communist Party, and the work we do is for ourselves, so we must not delay work, but do more. Female workers in clothing factories generally exceed the standard operation rate by one-third, and some have even completed twice the original production volume. When the task is urgent, they supervise each other to work overtime voluntarily. In the Kuomintang bandit regime, the production volume completed by 130 female workers in the hand-sewing group now only requires 50 people to complete. Song Jinying, a well-known fast producer among the female workers in the rubber factory, can glue 150 pairs of shoes a day. Zhou Lianzhi, a female worker in the brushing department, can brush an average of more than 700 pairs of inner shoe uppers every day, and the highest is 800 pairs, while the general production volume is at most more than 400 pairs.
    When the employee representative conferences were established in various military supply factories, the female workers also actively participated. Among the 44 employee representatives in the rubber factory, there were 14 female representatives, one of whom also served as a member of the factory management committee. Among the 63 employee representatives in the No. 1 Clothing Factory, female representatives accounted for 10. All 16 group leaders in the 16 workshops of the factory are also women workers. The leader of the hand-sewing group of the No. 3 Clothing Factory has to delay half of her production volume every day because she is busy with tasks such as receiving work, sending thread, and attending meetings. The members of the group decided to increase the collective production efficiency to complete the total production task of the entire group. As a result, not only did everyone do half of the work delayed by the group leader for her, but the entire group also exceeded the task by one time.
    Due to the correct wage policy implemented by the People's Government and the increased production efficiency of the laborers, the economic life of the female workers has been greatly improved. During the rule of the Kuomintang bandit gangs, no matter how hard they worked, they could not even guarantee more than 40 kilograms of sorghum rice per month, and they could not even support themselves. Female workers would have their jobs taken away when they had children, so they often had miscarriages in the workshops due to overwork. Now men and women are paid equally for equal work, and the work is recorded by piece. The more production, the higher the salary. For example, for Zhou Lianzhi of the rubber factory, the factory stipulates that she brushes an average of 290 pairs of shoe uppers per day, and her monthly salary is 105 points (points are the common wage calculation unit in the Northeast Liberated Area, and each point is calculated based on the total value of 1.63 kg of local mixed grain, 5.5 kg of coal, 0.035 kg of soybean oil, 0.045 kg of sea salt, and 0.2 square feet of white liberated cloth). According to her current highest output, she can earn about 290 points per month, of which sorghum rice alone is about 400 kg, in addition to cloth, coal, oil, salt, etc. In addition to her own consumption, it is enough to maintain the lives of two people. The lowest salary for female workers in clothing factories can also reach 70 points, which is more than enough to support themselves. Therefore, the lives of female workers are very active. Nearly 80 female workers in the rubber factory have participated in the Yangko team. Female workers account for half of the 100 students in the factory's staff night school. Now, various factories are actively preparing to set up nurseries, so as to completely liberate the female workers in the factory from family burdens and give more working women the opportunity to participate in production and construction.

　　沈阳女工
    解放后的沈阳市女工，在公营企业中以新的劳动态度从事生产，因此生产效率日趋增高，她们的生活也得到了改善。
    沈市女工众多的被服、橡胶等军需工厂中，生产任务经常是繁重而且需要限期完成的，女工们在生产中不但不落后于男工，有的甚至在数量与质量上超过了男工。她们说：我们的幸福是共产党给的，做的活计是给自己做的，所以决不能误工，而且要多做。被服工厂的女工一般都超过了标准作业率的三分之一，有的且完成了原定生产量的两倍。任务紧急时，她们就互相督促自动加班加点。在国民党匪邦统治时期手缝组一百三十名女工完成的生产量，现在只需五十人就可完成。橡胶厂的女工中有个出名的生产快手宋金英，她每天可粘鞋一百五十双，刷帮部的女工周连芝每天平均能刷七百多双里鞋帮，最高时达到八百双，而一般的生产量最多是四百多双。
    当各军需工厂建立职工代表会时，女工们也普遍地积极参加了，橡胶厂四十四名职工代表中，有十四名女代表，其中并有一个女工担任了工厂管理委员会的委员。被服一厂六十三名职工代表中女代表占了十名。该厂十六个工房的十六个组长，也全部由女工担任。被服三厂手缝组组长因为忙于领活、送线、开会等工作，每天平均要耽误生产量的一半，该组全组组员便开会决定以提高集体的生产效率来完成全组的总生产任务。实行结果，不但组长所耽误的一半活大家替她做了，而且全组还超过了任务一倍。
    由于人民政府实行了正确的工资政策以及劳动者提高了生产效率，女工们的经济生活得到了很大的改善。当国民党匪帮统治时期，她们不论怎样拚命，每月四十多斤高粱米还得不到保障，连自己也养不活。女工生了孩子饭碗就被打碎，所以常常有因劳动过度而流产在工房里的。现在男女同工同酬，按件记工，产量越多，工资越高。如橡胶厂周莲芝，厂方规定每天平均刷二百九十双鞋帮，每月工资就有一百零五分（分为东北解放区通行的工资计算单位，每分系按当地混合量一·六三斤，煤五·五斤、豆油零·零三五斤、海盐零·零四五斤，白解放布零·二方尺的总值计算）。按她现在的最高产量每月就可挣二百九十分左右，其中光高粱米便有四百斤左右，此外还有布、煤、油、盐等。除她本人吃用外，足可维持两个人的生活。被服厂的女工最低也能得到工资七十分，养活自己绰绰有余。因此，女工们的生活非常活跃，仅橡胶厂就有近八十名女工参加了秧歌队。该厂职工夜校一百名学生中女工占一半。现各厂正积极筹设托儿所，以便使在厂女工从家庭拖累中完全解放出来，并给更多的劳动妇女参加生产建设的机会。
