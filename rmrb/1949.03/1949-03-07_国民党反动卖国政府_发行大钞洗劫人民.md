　　Kuomintang Reactionary Traitorous Government
  　Issues Large Denomination Banknotes to Plunder the People
    Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 5th. The Kuomintang reactionary and traitorous government is once again issuing large denomination counterfeit Gold Yuan notes with denominations of 500 and 1000 yuan in order to plunder the people. Xu Kan, the puppet Minister of Finance, deceived the people when he announced the "Financial and Monetary Reform Plan" in Guangzhou on the 24th of last month, saying: "After the implementation of the new plan, the issuance of Gold Yuan will come to an end." He also said that "the government will mint a large number of silver dollars as preparation for stabilizing the current Gold Yuan and for future reissuance of silver dollars." These lies were completely bankrupt only four days after they were spoken. Liu Gongyun, the puppet Governor of the Central Bank, emphasized at a reception for the financial community in Shanghai on February 28: "The Gold Yuan will continue to be issued." On March 1, large denomination Gold Yuan notes with denominations of 1,000 yuan and 500 yuan, printed by the Kuomintang Central Printing Plant and the Shanghai Zhonghua Book Company, were circulated on the market. As soon as the large denomination banknotes were released, prices in Shanghai soared, and the counterfeit Gold Yuan depreciated by another 30 percent in one day on the 2nd. The Kuomintang Central News Agency also admitted that prices in Shanghai generally rose by 10 percent on the 2nd, and market fluctuations in other places were also severe. Public utilities operated by the Kuomintang government took the lead in raising prices, with railways and airlines increasing prices by 30 to 124 percent on the 2nd.

　　国民党反动卖国政府
  　发行大钞洗劫人民
    【新华社陕北五日电】国民党反动卖国政府又在增发五百元和一千元票面的伪金圆券大钞，用它来洗劫人民。伪财政部长徐堪上月二十四日在广州公布“财政金融改革案”时，曾欺骗人民说：“新方案实施后，金圆券即结束发行。”并说什么“政府将大量铸造银元，作为稳定目前金圆券及将来改发银元之准备。”这些谎话刚刚讲过四天，就全部破产了。伪中央银行总裁刘攻芸二月二十八日在上海招待金融界时强调声明：“金圆券将继续发行。”三月一日，国民党中央印制厂和上海中华书局承印的一千元和五百元票面的金圆券大钞即在市面流通。大钞出笼后，上海物价立即飞涨，伪金圆二日一天内又贬值了百分之三十。国民党中央社也承认二日上海物价普涨一成，其他各地市场波动亦烈。国民党政府经营的公用事业更是带头涨价，铁路及航空等皆于二日加价百分之三十至百分之一百二十四不等。
