　　Road Maintenance Workers Should Take Responsibility: Digging Up Spring Soil to Repair Roads Should Be Reviewed
To the Editor:
　　The North China Highway Bureau’s "highway maintenance workers" should conscientiously protect and repair highways. However, from what I have seen on the Neiqiu to Xingtai section of the highway, although they come and go every day, their maintenance of the highway is insufficient. Take the smaller potholes on the road, for example; they should fill them properly. Some places require adding water before filling with soil to ensure firmness, but they always just throw two shovels of soil or lift two small baskets of soil into a small pit and consider it done. After filling with soil, not to mention cars driving over it, sometimes after two gusts of wind it's gone, and the pit is still a pit. As for the small stones on the road, they see them and pass by without picking them up. Not only is it inconvenient for vehicles to travel, but sometimes vehicles hitting the stones can damage the road surface. Some of them, when digging soil to repair the road, not only dig spring soil, but also dig soil from the wheat fields of the masses near the Iron-Top Tomb. I feel that this kind of practice that harms the interests of the masses is very wrong and should be overcome and corrected.

　　护路员要负起责任来挖春地垫路应该检讨编辑同志：
    华北公路局“护养公路员”应当认真负责保护和修补公路。但就我所见到的，内邱到邢台段公路，他们一天虽来来往往，对公路的护养就不大够。就拿路上的一些较小的坑凹来说吧，他们应当好好垫补，有些地方须要加点水再垫土才能结实，可是他们总是见一个小坑扔两锨土或抬上两小筐土就算了。垫上土后别说汽车轧，有的刮两阵风就刮没了，坑还是坑。对路上的小石头，见了也不拣就过去了，不但车辆行走不便，有时车辆碰上石头就会触坏路面。他们有的在挖土垫路时，挖春地还不算，在铁顶墓南边还从群众的麦苗地挖土，这样妨害群众利益的作法我感到是很不对的，应克服纠正才好。
