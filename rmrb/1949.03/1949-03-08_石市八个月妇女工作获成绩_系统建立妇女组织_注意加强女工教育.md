Shijiazhuang News: In the eight months since the establishment of women's work in Shijiazhuang, various organizations have been initially established, and women have been mobilized to carry out various tasks such as production and supporting the front lines. The Preparatory Committee of the Shijiazhuang Women's Federation was established in June of last year, and the leading body of the Shijiazhuang Democratic Women's Federation was formally established in February of this year. In addition, three branch associations were set up: one for the Railway Bureau, one for the Shijiazhuang Branch of the People's Bank, and one jointly formed by staff from other agencies. Women's federations have been established in various districts and streets. In the past eight months, a total of more than 8,200 citizens and workers' family members in the urban districts have been organized to participate in production, making a total of more than 137,000 sets of winter military uniforms and spinning 9,891 catties of thread, earning a total of more than 360,000 catties of millet in wages, which can solve the half-year living expenses of more than 1,000 people. In November and December of last year, more than 20 women were introduced to employment. After the land reform, rural women in the suburban areas of the city have been allocated an average of 1.57 mu of land per person, and many women have shown more enthusiasm in participating in labor. From the process of mobilizing women to participate in production, the awareness of women in Shijiazhuang has been greatly improved. Of the 1,508 female workers in the city, 933 have joined the trade union. All 222 female students in girls' middle schools and normal schools have joined the student union. Of the 454 female staff members in the city, excluding female factory workers who have joined the trade union, 319 have joined the staff branch association. At the same time, 259 female cadres have been trained and promoted in six units of the women's federations in various streets and districts. In addition, women in factories and schools are constantly writing newsletters and poems and submitting them to newspapers. In terms of cultural learning, 60% of the female workers in Da Xing Yarn Factory participate in learning. Now, the most knowledgeable can recognize more than 2,000 characters, and the least knowledgeable can recognize 200 characters.

Currently, the biggest problem in the work is that due to the old-fashioned rural perspective in the leadership of women's work, the current work is still limited to a narrow circle. There is a lack of education and ideological transformation for female students, female teachers, and unemployed female intellectuals. In addition, specific issues for women such as marriage and nurseries have not been addressed with planned and step-by-step education and publicity, and temporary solutions are only sought when problems arise.

Based on the above situation, the Shijiazhuang Women's Federation has decided to carry out three tasks in the future: (1) Mobilize and organize women to participate in production and work hard; (2) Support the front lines; (3) Strengthen learning. And systematically and step-by-step oppose certain remaining feudal restrictions that oppress women. And specifically strengthen the education of female workers, and establish a job placement agency to protect women's employment issues.

　　石市八个月妇女工作获成绩
    系统建立妇女组织
  　注意加强女工教育
    【石家庄讯】石市建立妇女工作以来的八个月中，已初步建立各种组织，并发动妇女进行了生产及支援前线等各项工作。石市各界妇女联合筹备会系于去年六月成立，今年二月又正式建立石家庄市民主妇女联合会领导机构。另设三个分会：计铁路局一个，人民银行石家庄分行一个，其他各机关职员合组一个。各区街设有妇联会。八个月来，市内区共组织了市民及工属八千二百多人参加生产，共计缝制冬季军装十三万七千多套，纺线九千八百九十一斤，共得工资三十六万多斤小米，可解决一千多人的半年生活。在去年十一、十二两月中介绍了二十多个妇女就业。市郊区农村妇女经过土地改革，平均每人分得一亩五分七土地，不少妇女在参加劳动上表现得更积极了。从发动妇女参加生产的过程中，石市妇女的觉悟大大提高了，全市一千五百零八个女工，参加工会的有九百三十三个。女中、师范共二百二十二个女学生，全体参加了学生会。全市女职员除工厂女职员参加工会以外，其他四百五十四人中参加了职员分会的有三百一十九人。同时，各街区妇联会的计六个单位中培养与提拔了二百五十九名妇女干部。此外在工厂、学校中都不断有妇女写通讯、写诗歌，投寄报纸。在文化学习方面，大兴纱厂有百分之六十的女工参加学习，现在最多的能识到二千多字，最少的也识二百字。
    目前工作中最大的问题是：由于在妇女工作的领导上，存在老一套的农村观点，因此目前工作还只限于狭小的圈子里。对女学生、女教职员和失业的女知识分子等缺乏教育和思想改造。其他，对于妇女的一些具体问题如象婚姻、保育院等问题未作有计划、有步骤的教育与宣传，发生问题才临时设法去解决。
    根据以上的情况石市妇联决定今后应进行三项工作：（一）发动与组织妇女参加生产，努力劳动；（二）支援前线；（三）加强学习。并有计划、有步骤的去反对某些残余的封建束缚给妇女的压迫。并具体加强对女职工的教育，为保障妇女的职业问题，设立职业介绍所。
