Train

Wen Jize

A train was invented by a British worker. His name was Stephenson. As a child, he was a shepherd, and when he grew up, he was a groom. Later, he worked as a machine worker in the mining area for many years. He painstakingly studied the ore-transporting vehicles, thinking over and over, and trying to improve them. By 1825, he invented the train. He first started the train on September 25, 1825, from Stockton in central England to Darlington. It dragged seven carriages, loaded with ninety tons of coal and flour. During the process of his inventing the train, many conservatives did not believe that he would succeed. Even when the train was about to start, a person who was good at riding horses did not believe that the train could run faster than a horse. He insisted on riding a horse and racing against the train. Who knew that in the blink of an eye, the train left him behind by several miles? He could no longer catch up and had to admit defeat dumbfounded.

Before the invention of the train, vehicles were pulled by animals, such as horse-drawn carriages, mule-drawn carts, and ox-carts; or they were pushed or pulled by people, such as wheelbarrows. Compared with these vehicles, trains not only run faster, but also can run day and night without stopping, and can carry a large weight. The fastest horse-drawn cart can only run about ten miles per hour, while a train can run more than one hundred miles per hour. Things that would take hundreds of carts and a month to transport can be transported by train in one day and one night. Some people think that using science and machines costs more money than using old-fashioned backward tools, but this is completely wrong. Using those hundreds of carts, people have to eat grain, and mules have to eat fodder, which would require at least a thousand shi of grain. Using a train only requires a car of coal, which is a hundred times more economical than carts! Therefore, the invention of the train was a great revolution in the history of transportation development.

What force makes the train run so fast and carry so much weight?

The train has a locomotive. It has several important parts: one part is for holding water; one part is for burning coal; and one part is called the cylinder, which extends a long iron rod that is connected to the wheels. When the coal burns, the water is heated and turns into a large amount of steam, which enters the cylinder. The cylinder has a more complex device that can use the force of the water steam to push the long iron rod back and forth, causing the wheels to rotate. When water changes from liquid to steam, its volume expands by 1,600 times. In the cylinder, a very, very large force is generated, which is greater than the force of tens of millions of horses combined. Therefore, the train can carry the weight of tens of millions of horses and run very fast.

However, with just these parts, the train cannot run. There is another part of the mechanism called the brake, which controls the train's starting or stopping. The brake is in the driver's cab, and it has a long handle that extends next to the driver's seat; it also extends a pipe that leads to the bottom of each car. Each car has a branch pipe from this pipe that controls the brake shoes next to each wheel. The brake shoes control the wheels.

The person who drives the train, after the coal fire has burned enough and the cylinder has the power to drive the wheels, can start the train by pushing the long handle next to his seat, causing the brake shoes to move away from the wheels. The locomotive can then drag the train behind it and run forward at high speed. To stop the train, the person who drives the train must release the steam in the cylinder and push the long handle next to his seat to another position, causing the brake shoes to press on the wheels.

China's first railway, from Wusong to Shanghai, the Songhu Railway, began construction in 1868 and opened to traffic in 1876. Later, more than one hundred railway trunk lines and branch lines were successively built, such as Jinghu (Nanjing to Shanghai), Pinghan (Beiping to Hankou), Jinpu (Tianjin to Pukou), Yuehan (Guangzhou to Wuchang), Beining (Shenyang to Beiping), Pingsui (Beiping to Baotou), Zhengtai (Zhengding Shijiazhuang to Taiyuan), Longhai (Haizhou to Lanzhou, not completed), Jiaoji (Qingdao to Jinan), Middle East (Manzhouli to Changchun), and South Manchuria (Changchun to Dalian) (the Sino-Soviet Treaty combined the Middle East and South Manchuria railways into the Chinese Changchun Railway), totaling more than 20,000 kilometers. These railways were once used by the Manchu emperors, the Northern Warlords, and the Kuomintang reactionaries as tools for transporting troops to slaughter the people and to extract the people's blood and sweat. The Kuomintang reactionaries and Japanese imperialism also used these crisscrossing railways to divide our liberated areas into pieces. However, now things are fundamentally different. The liberated areas have been united into one, and are expanding. Transportation construction is also developing. In the Northeast, at the end of last year, 9,000 kilometers of railways were open to traffic. Within the customs, several railways, such as the western section of the Pingsui Railway, the Yangde Railway (Yangquan, Shanxi to Dezhou, Shandong), the Jinan Zhuozhou section of the Jinpu Railway, the Hanshe Railway, and the Daoqing Railway, have also been opened to traffic one after another. These railways now belong to the people.

　　火车
    温济泽
    火车是一个英国工人发明的。他的名字叫做斯蒂芬生，小时候当过牧童，长大了当过马夫，以后作了好多年矿区的机器工人。他刻苦研究运输矿石的车子，想来想去，想法子改良它，到了一八二五年，发明了火车。他第一次开动火车，是在一八二五年的九月二十五日，从英国中部斯托克顿开到达林顿。拖了七节车，装了九十吨煤炭和面粉。他发明火车的过程中，好多保守的人，不相信他会成功。一直到开车的时候，还有一个擅长骑马的人，不相信火车比马跑得快，硬要骑着马和火车赛跑，谁知道，转眼的功夫，火车把他丢在后面好几里，他再也追不上，才只好呆呆的认输了。
    在火车发明以前，车子都是牲口拉的，如马车、骡车、牛车；或者是人推或人拉的，如独轮车等。火车和这些车子比起来，不但跑得快，而且能够日夜不停地跑，又能够装载很大的重量。用最快的马拉大车，一点钟最多跑十多里，火车一点钟却能够跑一百多里。要用几百辆大车、要经过一个月才能运到的东西，装上火车，一天一夜就可以运到了。有人以为，用科学用机器要比用旧式落后工具花钱多，其实这完全想错了。用那几百辆大车，人要吃粮，骡子要吃料，起码得用一千石粮食，用火车，只要一车煤就够了，比大车要节省百倍！因此，火车的发明，在交通发展史上，是一个大革命。
    是什么力量使火车跑得这么快又能载重呢？
    火车有个火车头。它有几个重要部分：一部分是装水的；一部分是烧煤炭的；一部分叫做气缸，伸出很长的铁杆，连接着车轮。煤炭燃烧起来，水受了热，就变成大量的蒸汽，进到汽缸里。汽缸里有较复杂的装置，能够利用水蒸汽的力气，往返推动长铁杆，使车轮转动，当水由液体变成蒸汽的时候，体积膨胀增大一千六百倍。在气缸里，就产生很大很大的力气，比千万匹马的力气加在一起还要大。因此，火车就能够装载千万匹马驮的重量，并且跑得飞快。
    但是，仅仅有了这些部分，火车还不能够开行。另外还有一部分机关，叫做制动机，管制着火车的开动或停止。制动机在司机室里，它有一根长柄，伸在司机座位的旁边；它又伸出一根管子，通到各车底下，各车底下都由这根管子分出一个支管，控制着各车轮旁边的制动机蹄，制动机蹄是控制车轮的。
    开火车的人，等煤炭火力烧得足够了，汽缸有力气推动车轮了，要开动火车，就可以推动他座旁的长柄，使制动机蹄离开车轮，火车头就能拖着后面的列车，向前飞跑。要使火车停止，开火车的人，要放出汽缸里的蒸汽，并且要推动座旁的长柄到另一个位置，使制动机蹄压在车轮上。
    我国第一条铁路，从吴淞到上海的淞沪路，是一八六八年开始建筑，一八七六年开始通车的。以后陆续又筑成京沪（南京到上海）、平汉（北平到汉口）、津浦（天津到浦口）、粤汉（广州到武昌）、北宁（沈阳到北平）、平绥（北平到包头）、正太（正定石家庄到太原）、陇海（海州到兰州，未竣工）、胶济（青岛到济南）、中东（满洲里到长春）、南满（长春到大连）（中苏条约把中东南满两条铁路合称中国长春铁路）等铁路干线和支线一百多条，一共长两万多公里。这些铁路，曾经被满清皇帝、北洋军阀和国民党反动派用作运兵屠杀人民的工具，和榨取人民血汗的工具，国民党反动派和日本帝国主义还利用过这些纵横交错的铁路，把我们解放区分割成一块一块的。但是，现在根本不同了。解放区已经打成一片，并且正在扩大，交通建设也正在发展，在东北，去年底，有九千公里铁路通车；关内有好几条铁路，如平绥西段、阳德铁路（山西阳泉到山东德州）、津浦铁路的济南涿州段，邯涉铁路，道清铁路等，也先后通车。这些铁路，已经是属于人民的了。
