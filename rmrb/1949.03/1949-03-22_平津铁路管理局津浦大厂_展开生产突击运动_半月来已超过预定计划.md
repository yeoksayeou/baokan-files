　　Tianjin-Pukou Railway Factory of the Pingjin Railway Administration
    Launches Production Surge Campaign
    Exceeding Planned Targets in Half a Month
    [Tianjin Telegraph] Workers at the Tianjin-Pukou Railway Factory, under the Pingjin Railway Administration, have launched a production surge campaign to strive to complete the March production plan. In the first half of March, the factory has already repaired eight passenger cars, forty-nine freight cars, and six automobiles, completing more than half of the original full-month plan to repair ten passenger cars, one hundred freight cars, and ten automobiles. When discussing the full-month plan at the beginning, some workers lacked confidence because, during the period of Japanese puppet rule, with more than a thousand workers, the monthly car repair volume never exceeded one hundred vehicles; while now there are only eight hundred workers. The achievements of the first half of the month have greatly increased their confidence in completing the plan. The main reason for this achievement is that the lives of the workers have been guaranteed to a certain extent, coupled with the improvement of their political awareness through study, and their active efforts in formulating production plans and striving to complete them. After work, the forging worker Li Fulai took the initiative to ask the foreman for work to do; when the foreman was not there, he automatically went to work according to the "urgent" work order written on the foreman's desk. In order to rush the connection of the two-hundred-centimeter-heavy traction drawbar between the locomotive and the water tank, the forging department continued to work after get off work. A job that used to take one hundred and eighty man-hours to complete now only took seventy man-hours.

　　平津铁路管理局津浦大厂
    展开生产突击运动
    半月来已超过预定计划
    【天津电】平津铁路管理局所属津浦大厂的职工们展开生产突击运动，争取完成三月份的生产计划。在三月前半个月该厂已修好客车八辆、货车四十九辆、汽车六辆，完成了原定全月修客车十辆、货车一百辆、汽车十辆计划的一半以上。开头讨论全月计划时，有些职工还缺少信心，因在日伪统治时代，一千多工人，每月修车量从未超过一百辆；而现在只有八百多工人。半个月的成绩，已使他们完成计划的信心大大提高。这个成绩的获得，主要原因是职工们的生活得到了一定保障，加以在学习中提高了政治觉悟，积极订出生产计划，并且努力争取完成。锻工匠李富来工作之后，主动的向领班要活做；领班不在他就按着领班桌上写着“紧急”的工作单自动的去工作。锻工部为着赶接机车与水柜间二百公分重的牵引拉杆，在下班以后还继续工作着。这一个在以前需要一百八十个工时才能完成的工作，这次只用了七十个工时。
