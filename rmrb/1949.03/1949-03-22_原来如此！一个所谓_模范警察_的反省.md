So That's How It Is!
A Reflection from a So-Called "Model Policeman"
It is said that the police in Beiping are the "model" police in the whole country, with the reputation of "model policemen." But are they really "model"? Let's see the reflections of the police from the Internal Sixth Bureau of Public Security during their training!

Squad Leader Wang Yongzhi told a story about stealing coal:

"Once winter arrived, the superiors deducted our coal rations, which wasn't enough to burn. When the coal ran out, we were unbearably cold, and no one was willing to chip in to buy more, so we had to resort to stealing. At night, we'd send one or two people to the coal shops of the common people, jumping into their yards. The dogs would bark wildly, and the people would rush out to see what was happening. But as soon as they saw it was people in black uniforms stealing coal, they knew it was best not to provoke them, and they'd silently retreat back into their houses. Afterwards, we frequently went to steal coal, and a saying even spread among the masses: 'When you hear a dog barking at night, it's the police stealing coal!' We stole so much that the coal shops couldn't bear it anymore. One day, a coal shop reported to the squad: 'Police officers, please don't steal my coal anymore. How much do you need? I'll deliver it to you!' 'We want two hundred catties a day!' And so the coal shop delivered coal to us for free for several days. Later, they reported to the squad again: 'Police officers, we can't afford to supply you anymore...' 'No! You still have to deliver it. What's the price? We'll give you money!' -- But the money we paid was only one-third of the official price, so the people had to do business at a loss."

A traffic policeman said: Several times, in the "scorching heat of midday," he would walk, drenched in sweat, to the fruit stalls near the road, pick up some fruit, eat it, wipe his mouth, and leave. The vendors didn't dare ask him for money, otherwise, he would use the excuse of "banning stalls by the main road" to drive them away. Sometimes, the superiors would distribute batches of theater tickets, forcing the police officers to sell them to the citizens, but ordinary citizens, who could afford them, who even valued them? However, the police are the people's "military advisors" and "nannies," so the people had no choice but to comply. In order not to offend the police officers and not to disappoint the police officers' "good intentions," they had to give the police five or ten yuan, saying they couldn't afford to watch the play, asking them to take the tickets to sell elsewhere. Some people simply said: "How much for a ticket? Here's the money, we don't have time to watch the play."

Police officer Zhang Min said: "One family had a vacant house, and I asked them to rent it to my friend, but they refused. Later, I asked a 'wife' of a friend who worked in the Bandit Suppression Headquarters to move in, and they didn't even pay rent. There was nothing they could do about it."

At night, the police would use "checking lights" at the crossroads as an excuse to deal with rickshaws, bicycles, and pushcarts. Those without lights were not allowed to pass, but in fact, when encountering military personnel, military police, or important figures like "National Assembly Representatives," the police didn't even dare to utter a word.

There were also many "model policemen" who protected gambling dens and profited from them, protected prostitutes and took advantage of them. Accepting gifts during the New Year, accepting bribes, controlling "pulling room money" (meaning when someone wanted to rent a house, the police would act as a middleman and take a cut), and infringing upon the interests of the masses were countless. In the second training session of sixty-one people alone, a rough count showed that fifteen people frequented prostitutes, thirty-four gambled, thirty-four beat people, thirty received gifts (twelve received gifts individually, thirteen received gifts collectively, and five forced the masses to give gifts), and only three had not done anything seriously bad.

### 原来如此！一个所谓“模范警察”的反省

　　原来如此！
    一个所谓“模范警察”的反省
    据说，北平的警察是全国警察的“模范”，有“模范警察”之称。但是，到底是不是“模范”呢？请看公安内六分局警察在轮训中的反省吧！
    三段警长王永志说了一个偷煤的故事：
    “一到冬天，上级克扣我们的煤火，不够烧。煤烧完了，冷得难受，大家又不肯凑钱买，于是只好去偷。夜里，就叫一两个人到老百姓的煤铺子里去，跳进院子里，看房狗汪汪地吠起来，老百姓赶紧出来看，一看啊，原来是穿黑制服的人来偷煤，知道不好惹，便一声不响地又缩回屋子里去了。往后，我们经常地去偷煤，群众中还流传着这样一句话：‘晚上一听见狗吠，就是警察来偷煤！’偷得太多了，煤铺子受不了，有一天，煤铺子便到段上来报告：‘警察先生们，你们不要再偷我的煤了，你们要多少，我给你们送来吧！’‘我们要二百斤一天！’就这样煤铺子白白给我们送了几天，后来又到段来报告：‘警察先生，我们供不起你们了……’‘不行！还得送来，什么价钱？我们给你钱！’——但是，钱是按官价的三分之一付的，老百姓也得做亏本生意。”
    一个交通警说：有好几次，在“夏日炎炎日当午”的时候，他汗流浃背地走到马路附近的水果摊前，拿起水果就吃，吃完了，抹抹嘴巴起身就走。小贩不敢向他要钱，否则他就会拿“大马路旁取缔摊贩”的理由来骗逐他。有时，上级分下来一批戏票，强迫警士向市民推销，但是普通市民，谁看得起，谁又买得起呢？然而警察是百姓的“军师”、“保姆”呵，百姓不得不照办，为了不得罪警察先生，不辜负警察先生的“好意”，只好送五块、十块给警察，说看不起戏，请他把票子拿到别家去卖。有的百姓干脆说：“多少一张？给你钱，我们没有时间去看戏。”
    警士张敏说：“有一家老百姓有空房子，我请他租给我的朋友住，他不肯，后来，我叫一位在剿总做事的朋友的‘太太’进去住，连房租也不付，他对我也没有办法。”
    晚上，警察在马路口借用“查灯火”来对付三轮车、自行车和排子车的，凡是没有灯的不许通行，但事实上，遇见军人、宪兵、什么“国大代表”之类的大人先生，警察连气也不敢哼一声。
    还有许多“模范警察”，他们包庇赌场从中取利，包庇暗娼，占些便宜。年节收礼，接受贿赂，掌握“拉房钱”（即有人要租房子时，警察便从中拉线吃二毛），侵犯群众利益的事实，举不胜举。仅在第二期六十一人的轮训中粗略统计的结果：宿娼者十五人，赌博者三十四人，打人者三十四人，收礼者三十人（其中，个人收礼者十二人，集体收礼者十三人，强迫群众送礼者五人），没有做大坏事的仅仅三人。
