To overcome the phenomenon of spontaneous production, Yangcheng Strengthens Spring Farming Leadership. Resolve Cadres' Ideological Concerns, and Formulate Specific Leadership Plans.

[Our Newspaper’s Report] The Yangcheng County Government convened a meeting of village cadres from across the county to resolve their ideological concerns and encourage them to actively lead spring farming production. Although significant progress was made in production last winter, most of it was spontaneously initiated by the masses, with village cadres not providing active leadership, resulting in a state of spontaneous development, except in a few villages or by a few village cadres who played a considerable leading role. In particular, preparatory work for agricultural production was poorly executed. Less than half of the manure accumulated throughout the county was delivered to the fields. Regarding the preparation of agricultural tools, the original plan was to establish a farm tool factory in each district. However, due to a lack of attention in leadership thinking, it has not yet been organized. Village cooperatives rarely provide planned leadership and support for private iron and wood craftsmen, leading to a reluctance to produce tools for fear of not being able to sell them. The construction of dams was even worse. In light of the above situation, and to prepare for this year's major production campaign, the current primary production task is to urgently strengthen leadership, organize the masses to seize the time, and immediately take action to make up for the shortcomings in the preparatory work for spring farming last winter. To this end, from February 3rd to 8th, a meeting was held with more than 100 village cadres from villages that have completed party rectification and those that have not (excluding the second phase of party rectification villages) to discuss how to proceed. The meeting identified several major ideological problems among cadres that were hindering their leadership in production: Firstly, although many village cadres had not abandoned the idea of leading and organizing the masses in production, they struggled to find new methods. Secondly, cadres feared making mistakes and were timid in leading the masses. Village cadres in villages that had not undergone party rectification were waiting for party rectification to occur. Liang Tianshu, the manager of Baisang Suanyao, said, "The masses may not want us after party rectification. If they do, then we will do it!" Some village cadres also adopted an attitude of "the less trouble, the better." As for villages that had completed party rectification, it was found that some comrades feared being criticized by the masses if they did things wrong, while some newly appointed cadres felt that they lacked experience and were afraid of being laughed at by the old cadres, leading them to be hesitant, unenterprising, and inactive in providing leadership. In addition, some village cadres felt that their personal production had been "ruined" (presumably because their work was not done well) due to their work and wanted to stay home to reorganize their household affairs. The conference criticized the above ideas and clearly pointed out that if we abandon leadership in production and fail to organize individual farmers to help them solve difficulties, improve productivity, and become prosperous, the poor will not be able to completely turn over, and our struggle against feudalism and the elimination of landlord exploitation will be in vain. If most people do not live well, it will be difficult for cadres to live well. From the perspective of the relationship between the Party and the people, it is the same: if the Party leads production well, organizes the masses, and ensures that every household has full granaries and abundant livestock, will the people not support us? To achieve this, the method of administrative orders will not work. Administrative orders cannot lead the masses to organize themselves, nor can they make them prosperous. We must understand the benefits of organization based on the needs of the masses, inspire them to be conscious and voluntary, and organize mutual assistance. As the cadres present at the meeting gained a new understanding of these issues, they unanimously stated: "After returning to the village, we must not weaken when encountering difficulties, but must find all possible ways to strengthen production leadership." The conference concluded by arranging the agricultural production work for the first and second months of the lunar calendar: Firstly, manure collection, requiring 80% of the manure for grain fields to be collected during the first month, and all spring fertilizer to be transported during the second month, with a requirement of increasing fertilization by five dan per mu. Secondly, before spring ploughing, the newly collapsed dams (referring to those from last year) must be rebuilt, and efforts should be made to rebuild a portion of the old dams. Thirdly, based on the actual situation, each village is required to organize wood and iron workers to manufacture agricultural tools as needed. In addition, arrangements were made for harrowing spring fields, selecting seeds, repairing canals, selecting coal, chopping firewood, and women's textile work. Cadres were required to proceed in an orderly and step-by-step manner and to pay attention to inspections at all times.

### 克服生产自流现象　阳城加强春耕领导  解除干部思想顾虑具体订出领导计划

　　克服生产自流现象
  　阳城加强春耕领导
    解除干部思想顾虑具体订出领导计划
    【本报讯】阳城县府召集全县村干会议，解除干部思想顾虑，让其积极领导春耕生产。该县去冬生产虽有不少成绩，但除个别村庄或个别村干起了相当的领导作用外，大部是群众自发搞起来的，村干没有积极领导，以致陷于自流状态，特别是在农业生产的准备工作上作的很差。全县积肥送到地的不够一半。农具准备上，原计划每区建立一个农具厂，由于领导思想上没了注意，至今仍没组织，村合作社很少去有计划的领导和扶植私人铁木匠工，致铁木匠工怕造下农具卖不出去，不造农具。在垒堰上成绩更差。根据以上情况，为了有准备的进入今年的大生产运动，目前生产工作主要是急需加强领导，组织群众抓紧时间，立即动手，来弥补去冬春耕准备工作的不足。为此，二月三日到八日，召开了全县已整党村与未整党村（二期整党村没有）村干一百余人的会议，研究怎样进行。会上发现了干部放松领导生产的几个主要思想问题：一、不少村干思想上虽没放弃领导群众组织群众进行生产，但苦于没有新的办法。二、怕犯错误，胆怯地不敢领导群众，没整党的村干思想上是等待整党，白桑磺窑经理梁天书说：“整党时群众还不定要不要，要啦，咱再干！”还有些村干抱着多一事不如少一事的态度：至于整过党的村，发现有些同志是怕办错了群众提意见，有些新任干部觉着自己办法少，怕旧干部笑话，以致不敢大胆主动积极领导。此外，有的村干认为因为工作（应该是因为工作没搞好）把个人生产“搞垮”了，想在家整顿家务。大会对以上思想作了批判，明确指出：如果放弃领导生产，不去将个体的农民组织起来帮助他们解决困难，提高生产力，发家致富，穷人就无法彻底翻身，那么我们斗争了封建，消灭了地主剥削，就算白搭了。多数人日子过不好，当干部的日子也就难过得好。从党员和人民的关系上讲，也是一样的，党把生产领导好了，群众组织起来了，家家粮食满囤，猪羊满圈，人民还有不拥护的吗？要做到这些，行政命令的办法是走不通的，行政命令不能领导群众组织起来，也不能使他们发家致富。一定要根据群众要求，启发群众懂得组织起来的好处，自觉自愿，组织互助。由于到会干部对这些问题做了新的认识，因此一致表示：“回村后不能碰到困难就软了，一定要想一切办法，加强生产领导。”会议最后布置了阴历正、二月的农业生产工作：一、担粪，要求在正月里担起谷地粪百分之八十。二月完全运起春肥。要求每亩增肥五担。二、春耕前要把新塌堰（指去年）垒完，并争取垒旧堰一部。三、根据实际情况，要求各村组织木铁工人按需要制造农具。此外，对耙春地、选种籽、修渠道、选煤、砍柴和妇女纺织等都作了布置。要求干部有次序有步骤的进行，并随时注意检查。
