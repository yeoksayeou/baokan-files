[Jizhong Electric] Under the leadership of the democratic government, Shengfang City has developed various production cooperatives, organizing a large number of citizens and achieving good results. The city is located ninety li west of Tianjin and was liberated for the fourth time one month before the liberation of Tianjin. It has a population of over 40,000 (over 7,000 households). The production of ordinary citizens is mainly based on mat weaving and fishing. Mat weavers number about 15,000, while fishermen are mostly combined with agriculture, numbering about 5,000. Before liberation, due to the enemy's control of fish and mat exports and the exploitation of unscrupulous merchants, most people could not maintain their livelihoods. With the decrease and shrinking operations of industrial and commercial households, the number of unemployed workers increased. According to initial statistics after liberation, there were about 1,200. After the city was recovered, in addition to providing relief to more than 3,000 poor citizens who could not maintain their lives, the government allocated 500,000 yuan in People's Currency to assist in organizing mat weavers' supply and marketing cooperatives to provide them with living materials and promote the sale of members' products, thereby reducing intermediate exploitation by merchants. The city committee convened all cadres to convey the cooperative's guidelines and tasks, and conducted propaganda work at the neighborhood cadre and civilian congresses, organizing mat weavers to establish cooperatives and clarifying that share capital should be determined according to labor, with each household weaving one "ling" of large mats per day contributing 13 jin of corn as share capital, and increasing accordingly for those who weave more. Share capital is maintained in kind and does not distribute dividends. In the future, 10% of profits will be used as public accumulation fund, and 90% will be distributed according to the value of the mats and the number of shares. Members freely combine into groups of five to seven, with each group having a leader. Every four or five groups have a representative, and two or more representatives can establish a distribution branch. The cooperative officially started business on February 10. As of the 15th, it had collected 824 "ling" of coarse and fine mats and transported a large number of necessities such as coal, oil, matches, foreign cloth, and salt from Tianjin, supplying them to members at prices lower than the market price. Therefore, members have a good impression of the cooperative. Wang Xiao's mother said, "In the past, I thought the cooperative was useless, but now the cooperative benefits everyone." Xing Fuzeng said, "With the cooperative, we don't have to worry about not being able to sell mats." As a result, the number of shareholders is increasing daily. Statistics for the 15th show that more than 1,500 households of mat weavers have joined the cooperative. While organizing the mat weavers' cooperative, the city committee and the trade union convened a city-wide workers' meeting, calling for the organization of cooperatives. Shoe worker Lu Jiuheng conducted brewing among the unemployed workers. With their active efforts and government assistance, thirty unemployed workers have been organized, and they have democratically discussed the method of converting wages, such as 2.5 jin of millet for sewing soles, 1.5 jin of millet for upper shoes, and the total wage for each pair of shoes is 4.13 jin, with 5% of the profits awarded to those with outstanding achievements, 10% for the public accumulation fund, and the rest distributed according to the amount of labor (number of shoes made). Under the influence of government support and the mat and shoe industry cooperatives, unemployed ironworkers have also organized a "Gongsheng Cooperative." Twelve people have now organized four furnaces. Over six thousand households in the fishing industry cooperative have applied for shares, and the carpentry cooperative is also actively preparing.

    许多失业铁工席工找到生产门路
    【冀中电】胜芳市在民主政府领导下，发展各业生产合作社，组织大批市民，已获良好成绩。该市位于天津西九十华里，系在天津解放前一个月第四次解放，有人口四万余（七千余户），一般市民的生产以织席和制鱼业为主。席民约一万五千人，渔户则多与农业相结合，约五千余人。未解放前，由于敌人对鱼、席出口的统治及奸商的剥削，致使生活大都不能维持。随着工商户的减少与缩小经营，失业职工人数增多，仅据解放初期统计，约一千二百人左右。该市收复后，政府除对三千余无法维持生活之贫苦市民救济外，并拨人民券五十万元协助组织席民供销合作社，以供给他们生活资料与推销社员之制成品，以减少商人的中间剥削。该市市委会召集全体干部传达合作社的方针和任务，并在闾干部闾民大会上作了宣传工作，组织席民成立合作社，并阐明股金应按劳动力规定，每户每日织大席一“领”者，折入股金玉米十三斤，多者递增，以此类推。股金保持实物不分红利。将来盈利除百分之十为公积金外，百分之九十按席价值多少，按股分配。社员以五人至七人为一组，自由结合，每组设组长一人，每四组或五组设代表一人，两个代表以上者，可成立一分销社。二月十日正式开始营业、截至十五日的统计，收粗细丈席八百廿四“领”，并从天津运来大批煤、油、火柴、洋布、食盐等必需品，低于市价供给社员。因此，社员对合作社都有了好感，王小发的娘说：“过去以为合作社没啥用，现在合作社给人们都沾光了。”邢福增说：“有了合作社，就不怕席卖不了。”因之入股者逐日增加十五天的统计：席民入社者已达一千五百余户。组织席民合作社的同时，市委会及职工会召开了全市职工会议，号召组织合作社。鞋业工人卢九恒在失业工人中进行酝酿，他们积极活动与政府帮助，已有三十个失业工人组织起来，并民主讨论工价折合办法，如纳底子二斤十两小米，上鞋一斤五两小米，每双鞋总工资为四斤十三两，以红利的百分之五奖励有显著成绩者。以百分之十为公积金，其余按劳动数额（作鞋数）分红。在政府扶助和席业鞋业合作社的影响下，铁业失业工人也组织了“工生合作社”。现已有十二人组织了四盘炉。渔业合作社已有六千余户要求入股，木工合作社亦正积极筹备中。
