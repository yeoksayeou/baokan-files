　　How Should Shijiazhuang Carry Out Urban Women's Work?
　　Zhao Junqing
　　When we began women's work in Shijiazhuang, most of our women cadres came from rural areas. They were unfamiliar with the living habits of urban women and brought with them the old methods and narrow experiences from rural work. As a result, we encountered many difficulties and thought that urban women's work was difficult to carry out. However, based on a year of experience, if we change our fixed views from rural areas, proceed from the actual situation of urban women, analyze and research, and carry out work flexibly, urban women's work can and will open up and proceed smoothly.
　　The actual situation of urban women is different from that of rural areas. Urban women include female workers, female students, female teachers, female doctors, female performers, family members of workers, impoverished urban women, and general urban women. Among impoverished urban women, there are peddlers, small handicraft workers, coolies, night soil collectors, and rickshaw pullers. These people are not fixed in their occupations and often move around. For example, if a peddler does not make money selling malt sugar today, tomorrow he may go to the garden to sell scrap. They are also not fixed in their addresses. They may live on Chaoyang Road today and move to the east of the bridge tomorrow. They are in such a changing environment, and their long-term planning habits are naturally poor. The various women mentioned above also have their own requirements and living habits. For example, coolie women are eager to find suitable work to solve their living difficulties, are relatively good at labor, and live a relatively hard life; small vendors earn money more easily, live a richer life, and are not very accustomed to labor; female workers require improved skills and job security; female students require peace of mind to study and improve their cultural level; female teachers, female doctors, female staff members and other women also have different requirements according to their own economic living conditions. Therefore, among these different objects, different requirements, and different characteristics of women and young people, our work content, methods, and requirements cannot be uniform. In terms of organizational form, it cannot be the same as in rural areas, but must be organized according to production units in order to lead them.
　　After analyzing the actual situation clearly, we must, according to different objects, different requirements, and different ideological emotions and living habits, be good at approaching them, integrating with them, and enlightening and guiding them in ideology and life to change their views on us, and help them solve difficulties in production, occupation, and learning, so that they trust us to serve women and seek welfare for them and approach us. In this way, their enthusiasm and organizational requirements will be brought into play and improved. For example, when we first arrived in Shijiazhuang, we were most afraid of doing educational work for female intellectuals, but after the forum for intellectuals, we changed this fear and had a more correct understanding of female intellectuals, and gradually became close and opened up the work situation.
　　Now, although we still lack experience in urban women's work, as long as we are determined to start from one street, one neighborhood, one school, and one factory, understand clearly, and sincerely solve some problems of one neighborhood, one factory, or one school, then urban women's work can obtain preliminary experience, and then use these experiences to promote and carry out, so that the entire urban women's work can be universally carried out and gain more experience, and make the work move further forward.

　　(Editor's note: This article provides an experience for urban women's work; that is, we cannot mechanically transport the old methods of rural areas, but must proceed from the actual situation of urban women and enlighten women's consciousness according to the different requirements of various women, which is correct, but this article does not raise the work of female workers to the most important position, which is a great defect. It must be recognized that the female workers in the liberated areas, like male workers, are already in a leading position politically and socially. In cities like Shijiazhuang, women's work must go deep into factories, learn from female workers, serve female workers, and rely on them to unite and lead rural working women and other democratic classes of women to jointly participate in the construction of the new democratic state.)

　　石市怎样开展城市妇女工作？
    赵俊卿
    在石家庄开始进行妇女工作时，由于我们的妇女干部大部来自农村，不熟悉城市妇女的生活习惯，又带来了农村工作中的老一套作法与狭隘经验，因之碰到不少困难，而认为城市妇女工作很难开展。但是根据一年来的体验，如果改变了从农村带来的固定观点，从城市妇女的实际情况出发，分析研究，灵活的进行工作，城市的妇女工作是能够而且必然会打开局面、顺利开展的。
    城市妇女的实际情况，是与农村不同的。城市妇女中，包括女工、女学生、女教职员、女医生、女艺人、工人家属、贫苦市民妇女、以及一般市民妇女。而在贫苦市民妇女中、有小贩、小手工业者、苦力、粪夫、车夫等。这些人，在职业上是不固定的，常常会流动，比如一个小贩今天卖麻糖不赚钱，明天，他就可能到花园去卖破烂；在住址上，也不固定，今天在朝阳路住，明天可能就搬到桥东。他们处在这样变化的环境里，长期打算的习惯自然是较差的。而上述各种妇女，也各有她们的要求和生活习惯，如：苦力妇女是迫切要求找到适当的活做，解决生活的困难，在劳动上比较好，生活上也较艰苦；小商贩因为钱来的较易，生活上就较富裕，对于劳动就不大习惯；女工的要求则是提高技术，职业有保障；女学生的要求是安心就学，提高文化水平；女教员、女医生、女职员及其他妇女，也各按自己的经济生活条件有不同的要求。所以在这样不同对象，不同要求不同特点的妇女青年中，我们的工作内容方式与要求，就不能千篇一律，在组织形式上，也就不能和农村一样，而是必须按生产单位，进行组织，以便领导。
    在分析清楚了实际情况以后，就须根据不同对象不同要求与不同的思想情绪、生活习惯，善于接近她们，和她们打成一片，在思想上、生活上启发与诱导她们转变对我们的观点，并在生产上、职业上、学习上帮助她们解决困难，使她们信任我们是为妇女服务、为她们谋福利而靠拢我们。这样，她们的积极性与组织要求就会发挥和提高起来。如我们初到石家庄时，最害怕作的是女知识分子的教育工作，但在知识分子座谈会后，就改变了这种畏惧思想，而对女知识分子有了比较正确的认识，也就逐渐接近亲密起来，打开了工作的局面。
    现在，虽然城市妇女工作，我们还很缺乏经验，但是只要我们下定决心，从一街、一闾、一个学校、一个工厂开始，了解清楚，真心解决了一个闾、一个工厂或一个学校的某些问题，那么城市妇女工作即可得到初步的经验，再用这些经验，推广进行，就可能使整个城市妇女工作普遍开展起来而取得更多的经验、使工作更向前推进。
    　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　
    （编者按：这篇文章提供了城市妇女工作一个经验；即不能机械地搬运农村的老一套作法而要从城市妇女实际情况出发，按照各种妇女不同的要求去启发妇女觉悟，这是对的，但这篇文章没有把女工工作提到最重要地位，则是一个极大的缺陷。必须认识到：解放区的女工，同男工一样，在政治上和社会上已经处在领导者地位，象石家庄这样的城市，妇女工作必须深入工厂，向女工学习，为女工服务，依靠他们团结并领导农村劳动妇女以及其他民主阶层妇女共同参加新民主主义国家建设工作。）
