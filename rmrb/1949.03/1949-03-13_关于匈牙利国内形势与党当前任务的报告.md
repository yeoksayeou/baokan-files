　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 11th: The Electric News Agency of Budapest reported: The Central Committee of the Hungarian Working People's Party listened on the 5th to a report by the party's General Secretary and Deputy Prime Minister, Lakosi, on the domestic situation in Hungary and the party's current tasks.

　　Lakosi's report declared: The Hungarian People's Independent Front has expanded due to the participation of the former opposition parties, the Independent Democratic Party and the Radical Party. Both parties recognize that anyone in Hungary who opposes the people's democracy can only serve the enemies of the people, serve the reactionaries, and only add fuel to the flames of imperialism.

　　When discussing the case of Cardinal Mindszenty, Lakosi recalled that the Hungarian government and the Working People's Party had tried for the past four years to establish an agreement with the Catholic Church similar to those already concluded with other religious groups in Hungary. An agreement with the Catholic Church was not reached because the Vatican colluded with American imperialism, and American imperialism attempted to rule the world.

　　Lakosi continued: The rampant imperialists' plan in Central Europe is to merge Bavaria, Austria, and Hungary under the reign of St. Stephen – the Habsburg regime (referring to the former Hungarian reactionary regime). One fighter who works for this regime is Cardinal Mindszenty, and the US government's support for the Habsburg plan is now confirmed by the evidence that Otto von Habsburg was even able to establish an Austrian Legion within the US Army during the war.

　　The agreement written by the Hungarian fascist military mission upon meeting the Pope explained the Vatican's support, stating that the Pope's support was for "a united Catholic monarchy in the Danube region to counter the Soviet Union." This was the topic discussed by the Pope and Hungarian fascist General Zombathelyi, who agreed that a group consisting of Bavaria, Austria, Hungary, Croatia, and parts of Czechoslovakia would serve as a strong anti-Soviet wedge.

　　Lakosi stated definitively: In this situation, reaching an agreement between Hungary and the Vatican is truly difficult. To achieve its goals, the Vatican does not spread the seeds of peace but rather spreads the seeds of suspicion and discord. The Vatican was able to reach agreements with Mussolini and Hitler but could not reach an agreement with the Hungarian People's Democratic Republic because this agreement went against its own plans and the plans of American imperialism. This is why the Vatican continued to support and encourage Mindszenty even after the Hungarian government published evidence of his illegal activities.

　　Lakosi then presented two documents proving that the Catholic bishops and Mindszenty were engaged in internationally hostile actions against the people's democracy and proving that the verdict against his crimes was not only necessary to defend the Hungarian people's democracy but also necessary to defend the people's democracy internationally.

　　Lakosi then pointed out the hypocrisy of Western imperialists and their Labour Party lackeys in the anti-Hungarian movement. He said: Just as Bevin was accusing the Hungarian Democratic Republic of violating human rights by trying Mindszenty, head-hunting savages from Borneo were being transported by British special planes to Malaya to oppose the national liberation movement. The head-hunting savages used poisoned arrows to kill freedom-loving Malayans and cut off their heads, thereby receiving special rewards from British humanitarians. Lakosi said: "It is clear that we are unwilling to accept the opinions put forward by these people who use such means to maintain their colonial exploitation."

　　When discussing the socialist construction of Hungary, Lakosi stated: The Hungarian working class is growing, and its tasks are also increasing. The progress of the working peasants has been demonstrated in the elections of the Farmers' Alliance, in which not only small peasants but also middle peasants participated in the democratic front. Throughout Hungary, the cooperative movement is taking root. In particular, production cooperatives are becoming increasingly common. Lakosi then criticized the Party's work in the countryside. He used the Soviet Union as an example, pointing out how the Party's work should be carried out and how errors in rural policy should be avoided in Hungary. He said: The main error of the Hungarian Working People's Party is the lack of distinction between small peasants, middle peasants, and rich peasants, feudal landlords. Although the people's democracy has the greatest support of agricultural workers and small peasants (i.e., poor peasants) as well as new landowners, this does not mean that all these people always and in all circumstances support the Hungarian Working People's Party. This is especially evident during elections. At that time, not all the people of Hungary voted for the Working People's Party. The majority of our people are won over to the cause of socialism through daily work, examples, education, and persuasion. He said: In 1947, the Party carried out the task of winning over the middle peasants. This task has been accomplished. First, by neutralizing the middle peasants, so that they do not combine with our class enemies, and then by persuading the middle peasants and a part of the working peasants, so that the struggle against the rich peasants can begin. Organizations uniting small peasants, middle peasants, and agricultural workers have been established.

　　Lakosi stated: Here, our main error is reflected in: we issued the slogan of winning over the middle peasants, thus neglecting the small peasants - our best allies. As a result, in many places, middle peasants and even rich peasants have gained positions in the organizations of the Working People's Party. Thus, this situation has occurred: not only has the Party's line been violated, but the class enemies have benefited from our mistakes. As a result, we have not helped the middle peasants to overwhelm the arrogance of the rich peasants, but we have gone astray. Lakosi then said: Only by correcting these mistakes can the agricultural part of the Five-Year Economic Plan be completed.

　　Due to the implementation of the Five-Year Economic Plan, the Hungarian national economy will increase by 60 percent, while the iron, machine, and chemical industries will increase by 200 percent. Lakosi said that in these three industrial sectors alone, 300,000 new workers will be needed. The entire structure of the Hungarian national economy is changing. After the completion of the Five-Year Plan, Hungary will be transformed from an agricultural country into an industrial country. In five years, another 1.5 million people in Hungary will use electricity, and every village will have telephone communication. Five hundred machine stations with 21,000 tractors will be established, requiring 50,000 new technicians. Two hundred thousand cultural centers will intensify the education of the Hungarian people.

　　During the review of Party members, the Hungarian Working People's Party purged 170,000 citizens who did not meet the qualifications of members of the Working People's Party. Currently, the Party's strength is just over one million.

　　关于匈牙利国内形势与党当前任务的报告
    匈劳动人民党总书记  拉科西
    【新华社陕北十一日电】电通社布达佩斯讯：匈牙利劳动人民党中央委员会五日听取了该党总书记、副总理拉科西关于匈牙利国内形势与党当前任务的报告。
    拉科西的报告宣称：匈牙利人民独立阵线因前反对党独立民主党与激进党的参加而扩大了。两党都认识到：凡在匈牙利反对人民民主的人只能为人民的敌人，为反动派效劳，只能给帝国主义火上添油。
    拉科西谈到红衣主教明曾蒂案时追述说：匈政府和劳动人民党过去四年曾试图与天主教教会成立业已与匈牙利其他宗教团体缔订的相似协议。与天主教教会的协议没有达成，因为梵蒂冈与美帝国主义勾结，而美帝国主义则企图统治世界。
    拉科西继称：猖狂的帝国主义者在中欧的计划是要把巴伐利亚、奥地利与匈牙利合并在圣·斯蒂芬王朝——哈布斯堡政权（按即前匈牙利反动政权）之下。为这种政权卖力的一个斗士便是明曾蒂红衣主教，而且美国政府之支持哈布斯堡计划现在已为奥图·哈布斯堡战时竟能在美军中建立奥地利军团这一证据所证实。
    匈牙利法西斯军事使团在谒见教皇后所写就的协议讲到梵蒂冈的支持，解释教皇这一支持是为了“一个对付苏联的多瑙河地区统一的天主教大君主国”。这便是教皇与匈牙利法西斯将军佐姆巴塞利所讨论的主题，佐姆巴塞利同意由巴伐利亚、奥地利、匈牙利、克罗提亚与捷克斯洛伐克的某些部分组成的集团，将为强固的反苏楔子。
    拉科西确定地说：在这种情况下要达到匈牙利梵蒂冈的协议实在是困难的。梵蒂冈为了实现它的目的，不散布和平的种子，反而散播猜忌与纠纷的种子。梵蒂冈曾经能够和墨索里尼和希特勒达成协议，但是却不能和匈牙利人民民主国达成协议，因为这协议是与它自己的计划和美帝国主义的计划背道而驰的。这便是为什么梵蒂冈甚至在匈政府公布了明曾蒂非法行为的证据之后还支持与怂恿他的缘故。
    拉科西于是出示两个文件，证明天主教的主教们与明曾蒂在国际上反人民民主的敌对行动，并且证明对其罪行的判决，不仅为保卫匈牙利人民民主所必需，而且也是在国际上保卫人民民主所必需。
    拉科西然后指出西方帝国主义者及其工党奴才在反匈运动中的伪善态度。他说：正当贝文责难匈牙利民主国因审判明曾蒂而侵害人权时，婆罗洲的猎取头颅的野人被英国专机运到马来亚，用来反对民族解放运动。猎取头颅的野人用毒箭杀害爱好自由的马来亚人，砍掉他们的头颅，因而得到英国人道主义者的特别奖赏。拉科西说：“很明白，我们不愿接受这些为了维护他们的殖民地剥削而运用这种手段的人们所提出的意见”。
    拉科西谈到匈牙利社会主义建设时称：匈牙利工人阶级正在成长着，其任务也在日益增大。劳动农民的进步已在农民联盟的选举时表现出来，其中不仅小农而且中农也参加了民主阵线。在全匈牙利，合作社运动正在扎下深根。特别是生产合作社正越来越普遍。拉科西于是对农村中党的工作进行批评。他以苏联为例，指明党的工作应该怎样进行，应该怎样在匈牙利避免农村政策上的错误。他说：匈牙利劳动人民党的主要错误是在对待小农、中农与富农、封建地主这两方面之间缺少区别。虽然人民民主有着农业工人与小农（即贫农）以及新的土地所有者的最大的支持，然而这并非意味着所有这些人民经常而且在一切情况下都支持匈牙利劳动人民党。这特别在选举时看出来。那时并非匈牙利一切人民都投了劳动人民党的票。我国人民的多数是经过日常的工作、例子、教育和说服等努力，而被争取到社会主义事业方面来了。他说：一九四七年党曾执行争取中农的任务。这个任务已经达成。首先是经由中立中农，以使他们不与我们的阶级敌人结合，随后便做到了说服中农及一部分劳动农民，这样反对富农的斗争便可以开始了。吸收小农与中农的农民与农业工人的统一的联合会组织起来了。
    拉科西称：这里，我们的主要错误表现在：我们发出争取中农口号，因而忽略了小农——我们的最好的同盟者。其结果是在许多地方，中农甚至富农在劳动人民党的组织中取得地位。这样，便发生了这种情形：不仅党的路线被违犯了，而且阶级敌人从我们的错误中得到了利益。结果，我们就没有帮助中农使他们压倒富农的气焰，而恰恰走入歧途。拉科西于是说：只有改正了这些错误，五年经济计划的农业部分才能完成。
    由于履行五年经济计划，匈牙利国民经济将提高百分之六十，而铁、机器与化学工业则将提高百分之二。拉科西说，仅在这三个工业部门中，便需要三十万新的工人。匈牙利国民经济的整个结构正在改变中。在五年计划完成之后，匈牙利将由农业国变成工业国。在五年之后，匈牙利将由农业国变成工业国。在五年之后，匈牙利将另有一百五十万人使用电力，而且有电话联络每一个村庄。具有二万一千架拖拉机的五百座机器站将建立起来，需要五万名新的技师。二十万文化中心将加紧匈牙利人民的教育。
    匈牙利劳动人民党在审查党员期间，曾清除出十七万不合劳动人民党员条件的公民。目前党的实力刚刚超过一百万人。
