    Preventing Those Trying to Fish in Troubled Waters from Causing Trouble
    [Our Newspaper] Employees of the Pingjin Railway Administration actively participated in inventory, ensuring the smooth progress of the work. Under the leadership of the Military Control Commission representatives, the bureau formed an inventory committee in early March, with various departments and offices successively establishing inventory sub-committees and groups, attended by employee representatives from each department and office. During the inventory process, workers demonstrated a high level of enthusiasm: employee representatives from the Motive Power Department voluntarily increased their night shifts. Workers in the Traffic Department checked automobile parts one by one, saying, "In the past, we had no say in the Kuomintang's railway property; now the property belongs to the people, so we must carefully take inventory." The worker representatives taking inventory of the cloth stored by the "Employee Welfare Committee" were even more conscientious. They measured the cloth inch by inch and raised objections to the original supervisor's method of tightly pulling the cloth to measure more inches, saying, "You're not doing business, why do you have to do this!" Many workers submitted written suggestions, pointing out where to conduct spot checks, etc. This led to the discovery of many discrepancies between the inventories and the actual goods, as well as materials not listed on the inventories. For example, important items such as radios, transmitters, and generators in the Electrical Repair Department had not been registered, and have now been found. Four or five hundred doses of "Salvarsan 606" were missing from the Railway General Hospital and are currently being tracked down. A batch of medicines also disappeared, but after mobilization, those who had hidden them returned them. More than thirty bolts of silk were missing from the Xibianmen warehouse and are also being sought. This is because some people wanted to fish in troubled waters during the inventory, but their attempts were ultimately discovered thanks to the hard work of the employees.

　　平津铁路管理局职工
  　积极参加清点物资
    使混水摸鱼的人无法捣鬼
    【本报讯】平津铁路管理局职工积极参加清点，使清点工作顺利进行。该局在军管会代表领导下，于三月初组成清点委员会，各处室先后成立了清点分会与小组，由各处室职工代表分别参加。在清点过程中，工人表现了高度的积极性：机务处的职工代表自动增加夜班。车务处工人一件件的查点汽车零件，并说：“过去国民党的铁路财产，咱根本不能问；现在财产是人民的了，就得仔细清点。”清点“员工福利委员会”所存布匹的工人代表，更是认真。他们一尺一尺的量布，对原主管人量布时紧拉着布想多量出尺寸的办法，提出意见：“又不要你做买卖，何必这样！”不少工人提出书面建议，指明何处要抽查等。这样使不少清册与实物不相符合的现象，以及清册上没有的物资，都被发现。如电工修理部的电台、发报机、发电机等重要物件未曾登记，均已查出。铁路总医院的四五百支“六○六”不翼而飞，现正追寻中。还有一部药品不见了，经动员后，私藏者都送了回来。西便门仓库有三十多匹绸子漏了帐，亦在寻索中。这是因为有些人想在清点当中混水摸鱼，但在职工们的努力工作下，终被发觉。　　　　　　（陈迹）
