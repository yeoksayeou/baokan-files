　　Introduction to the Central Plains Women's Delegation
    The Central Plains Liberated Area encompasses a vast region with a population of fifty million across more than two hundred counties, the majority of which are newly liberated areas opened up successively after the People's Liberation Army crossed the Yellow River in July of the year before last. The rural areas of western Henan only cleared out bandits last October, and cities such as Zhengzhou and Kaifeng were only liberated last November. In the past, the vast number of sisters in the Central Plains suffered even more cruel and brutal torment at the hands of the Kuomintang reactionaries. Tens of thousands of women's husbands and sons were slaughtered and taken away. In Erzhuang Handian Village, Jia County, the farmer Zhang Zhong's husband and three brothers were all taken away. Her husband died in the barracks, and her younger uncle was beaten to death by Kuomintang bandit troops. Under the Kuomintang bandit troops' "three alls" policy (burn all, kill all, loot all), villages in ten districts of the Henan-Anhui-Jiangsu Third Sub-region were completely burned down, and in the Da Kang County Fifth and Sixth Districts of the First Sub-region, eighty percent of the young and middle-aged women were raped. The Kuomintang bandit troops shamelessly talked about "not minding if they are eighty and old, or twelve or thirteen and young." Many young girls aged twelve or thirteen, women in labor, pregnant women, and old women were gang-raped to death. Under the rule of the landlord, local tyrant, head of the baojia system, and bandits—a quadruple alliance—women were forcibly taken, sold, and raped. Forcing women to work for them without pay was even more commonplace. The sisters in the Central Plains suffered such inhuman torment that their desire for liberation was particularly urgent. Once they received the leadership of the Communist Party and the assistance of the People's Liberation Army, they quickly organized and bravely waged a resolute struggle against the enemy. During the Huaihai Campaign, the vast number of sisters in Henan, Anhui, and Jiangsu enthusiastically participated in supporting the front. Preliminary statistics from the First Sub-region alone show that they milled 97 million jin of flour. In Zongdian, @ County, six villages with 150 women made 910 sets of cotton clothes in three days. In Bozhou City, 162 women's groups completed 4,034 cotton quilts and 4,836 straw mats in 33 days. Comrade Liu Jianrong is one of many models of support for the front. She led 150 women in weaving 260 bolts of cloth, 300 pairs of leggings, sewing 108 coats, making 910 cotton clothes, 900 pairs of cotton socks, and 300 pairs of comfort shoes in seventeen days. She led by example in everything she did, earning the support of the broad masses. She is a very good Communist Party member and was also elected as a representative to this National Women's Congress. Others, such as Kang Li, who serves as the administrative village chief in Sui County, collected 1,500 jin of wheat in one day and night and completely loaded and transported it away within three days. All the grain delivered from her village was properly sifted, winnowed, and packed according to regulations. In addition, there are many models of supporting the army, such as Xu Xiuying, and many other outstanding sisters who are now scattered throughout the villages and cities of the Central Plains, diligently carrying out the work of supporting the front.
    Although the number of female workers in the cities of the Central Plains is small, they are the most quickly awakened. Comrades Li Guirong and Wu Muxiang, representatives to the National Women's Congress, are active members of the Zhengzhou Cigarette Factory's female workers. Because of their hard work in production and active learning, they enjoy high prestige among the masses. In the less than one month of work after the liberation of Kaifeng, more than sixty female workers joined the female workers' night school to study and automatically stipulated labor discipline. In addition, 20,400 poor working women participated in shoe-making groups, making 600,000 pairs of military shoes in three months, subsidizing the lives of 5,001 households. Zhang Dasao, who is attending the National Women's Congress this time, is a production model from Luoyang. She solved her family's livelihood by participating in shoe production.
    The vast number of rural sisters in the Central Plains actively participate in the democratic struggle against bandits and local tyrants. Their poignant accusations have become an important force in raising the class consciousness of the peasant masses, and they actively participate in peasant associations. When the Baofeng First District held its district peasant representative conference on December 10, there were 835 female members and 74 female representatives. Three women were elected as members of the district peasant association. By December 29, the number of female members had quickly grown to 3,306, exceeding the original number by three-quarters in less than twenty days, and the number of female village cadres reached 150. Zhang Zhong, a farmer in Handian, said excitedly: "Chairman Mao told me to stand up, so I will stand up. I am not afraid of anything in the future. My relatives and neighbors advised me not to come to the meeting, but I didn't listen. I want to attend the meeting and seek revenge..." Ma Lurong from Zhouying Township said: "We must do a good job. In the past, people called us poor people 'dead turtles,' but now the 'dead turtles' are alive, and the 'live turtles' are dead." Comrade Lu Zhilan, who is attending the National Women's Congress this time, is a female backbone of the peasant movement in the new district. Since childhood, she has suffered all kinds of oppression from the feudal landlord class and has been forcibly taken and sold twice by the bao head and landlord. Therefore, she urgently demanded liberation. At first, others dared not attend meetings, but she dared to go. In addition to mobilizing women in her own village, she also linked up farmers in the surrounding ten villages by sharing her suffering, organizing 750 women to join the peasant association in a very short period of time. She deeply understands the suffering of the poor and can help women solve problems well. She was elected as a member of the district and county peasant associations and as a representative to the National Women's Congress.
    The students, teachers, staff, and intellectual sisters in the Central Plains, after the liberation of Xuzhou and the victory of the Huaihai Campaign, enrolled by the hundreds and thousands in Zhongyuan University, Military and Political University, and Jianguo College, and participated in various revolutionary works, taking the initiative to accept revolutionary training and actively transforming their thinking. Many intellectual sisters eagerly signed up to go south. Among the 34 Central Plains representatives attending this National Women's Congress, six are newly emerged intellectual women from the local area.
    The medical workers and sisters in other positions who served on the front lines have even more heroic deeds. Unfortunately, because they were working intensely on the front lines when the Central Plains Women's Congress was held, they were unable to participate, which is a major shortcoming of this Central Plains Women's Delegation.
    Women's work in the vast new areas of the Central Plains is very weak. The area with the longest period of truly organized leadership has only been for three months. However, the vast number of sisters in the Central Plains have quickly organized and undertaken many heavy tasks of production and support for the front. Now, women's federations at all levels and in all cities, as well as the Central Plains Women's Federation Preparatory Committee, have been established one after another. The Communist Party's leadership and assistance, the great victory of the Liberation War, and the high morale of the masses are the decisive reasons for such rapid development. At the same time, the active and in-depth work of a group of female cadres who went from the old liberated areas, quickly blending in with the local masses and helping them to stand up, is also a major reason.

　　中原妇女代表团的介绍
    中原解放区包括了五千万人口二百多个县的广大地区，绝大部分是前年七月解放军南渡黄河后陆续开辟的新解放区。豫西农村去年十月才肃清土匪，郑州开封等城市去年十一月才解放。过去中原的广大姐妹曾经遭受了国民党反动派更多更残酷的摧残与蹂躏，千万妇女丈夫儿子被屠杀被抓走，郏县二庄韩店村农妇张仲丈夫弟兄三人全被抓走，丈夫死在兵营，小叔也被国民党匪军乱棍打死。在国民党匪军“十光”暴行下，豫皖苏三分区有十个区的村庄完全被烧毁，一分区大康县五六区青壮年妇女百分之八十被强奸，国民党匪军们无耻的谈论着“八十岁的不嫌老十二三岁不嫌小”，许多十二三岁的小姑娘、产妇、孕妇、老太婆被轮奸致死。在地主恶霸保甲长土匪四位一体的统治下强霸强卖强奸妇女，至于强迫妇女替他们无代价的劳动，更是普遍的现象，中原的姐妹们，遭受着这种惨绝人寰的摧残，翻身的要求特别迫切，一旦得到共产党的领导和人民解放军的援助，便迅速的组织起来英勇地和敌人进行了坚决的斗争。淮海战役中豫皖苏广大姐妹热烈地参加了支前工作，仅一分区的初步统计共磨面九千七百万斤，＠县宗店六个村一百五十个妇女三天中作了九百一十套棉衣。亳市一百六十二个妇女组三十三天中完成四千零三十四床棉被，四千八百三十六床草褥，刘建荣同志便是许多支前模范中的一个，她领导了一百五十名妇女在十七天中织布二百六十匹，织裹腿三百付，缝大衣一○八件，作棉衣九一○件，棉袜子九百对，慰劳鞋三百双。她处处以身作则，得到广大群众的拥护。她是很好的共产党员，又被选为出席这次全国妇女代大会的代表。其他如睢县担任行政村长的康李氏，一天一夜收齐一千五百斤小麦，三天内完全装好运走，凡她村的出粮，完全按规定筛好、簸好、装好。此外还有许多拥军模范如许秀英等许多优秀的姐妹，现在正散布在中原的乡村和城市，紧张地进行支前工作。
    中原城市的女工数目虽少，但觉悟最快，出席全国妇代大会代表李桂荣、吴木香二位同志便是郑州烟厂女工的积极分子，由于她们努力生产积极学习，在群众中有着很高的威信。在开封解放后不到一个月的工作过程中就有六十多个女工参加女工夜校学习，并且自动规定劳动纪律。还有两万零四百贫苦劳动妇女参加作鞋组，在三个月中作了六十万双军鞋，补助了五千零一户的生活。此次出席全国妇代大会的张大嫂是洛阳的生产模范，她因为参加作鞋生产解决了家庭生活。
    中原区广大的农村姐妹积极参加反匪反霸的民主斗争，她们沉痛的诉苦成为提高农民群众阶级觉悟的重要力量，并且积极参加农会。保丰一区在十二月十号开区农代大会时女会员有八百三十五名，女代表有七十四名，三个妇女被选为区农会委员，到十二月二十九日女会员很快发展到三千三百零六名，不到二十天中超过原数四分之三，女村干部达到一百五十名。韩店农妇张仲曾激动地说：“毛主席叫我翻身我就要翻身，以后什么都不怕了，亲戚邻家劝我不要来开会，我不听，我要开会，要报仇………”周营乡马路荣说：“我们要好好的干，过去人家叫咱穷人‘死鳖’，现在‘死鳖’活了，‘活鳖’死了。”这次出席全国妇代大会的卢志兰同志，就是新区农民运动的妇女骨干，她自幼受尽了封建地主阶级给她的种种压迫，曾被保长地主两次强霸强卖，因此她迫切要求翻身，起初别人不敢去开会，她敢去，除了发动本村妇女外，还以苦引苦把附近十村的农民串连起来，很短期间组织了七百五十个妇女参加了农会。她对穷人的苦处了解得深切，能很好帮助妇女解决问题，被群众选为区县农会委员和出席全国妇代大会的代表。
    中原的学生、教职员、知识分子姐妹们，在徐州解放和淮海战役胜利结束后，成百成千的考入中原大学、军政大学、建国学院，和参加各种革命工作，主动的要求接受革命的训练，积极改造思想，许多知识姐妹，争先恐后的报名南下。这次出席全国妇代大会的中原代表全体三十四人中就有六个新从本地起来的知识妇女。
    在前线服务的医务工作者和其他岗位的姐妹们有着更英勇的事迹，可惜因中原妇代开会时，她们正在紧张的前线工作中，没有能够参加，是这次中原妇女代表团的一个大缺点。
    中原广大新区的妇女工作是很薄弱的，真正有领导的开始最久的地区也只有三个来月的时间，可是中原的广大姐妹却迅速的组织起来担负了生产支前许多繁重工作。现在各地各市妇联会和中原妇联筹委会都相继成立，所以能够发展得这样快，共产党的领导与帮助，解放战争的伟大胜利和群众情绪的高涨是决定的原因，同时从老区去的一部分妇女干部积极深入工作很快的和当地群众打成一片，帮助她们翻身也是主要原因之一。
