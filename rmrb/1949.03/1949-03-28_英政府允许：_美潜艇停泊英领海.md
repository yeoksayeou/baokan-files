Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 26th: London dispatch: British Member of Parliament, Mr. Mikardo, who was expelled from the Labour Party for opposing the right-wing leadership of the Labour Party, strongly criticized the British government for following the war policy of the United States during a speech in the House of Commons on the 23rd. Mikardo described Britain as a "vassal of the United States" and denounced the British government for "conspiring with the United States to facilitate the occupation of Britain by the U.S. military" under an agreement with the United States. Mikardo questioned the Parliamentary Secretary to the Admiralty: Under what clauses and what treaties was the U.S. submarine "Cusk" able to dock in British territorial waters alongside the destroyers of the British Home Fleet for a month? Mikardo pointed out: If this action were publicly announced, it would inevitably arouse the resentment and opposition of millions of British people.

　　英政府允许：
  　美潜艇停泊英领海
    【新华社北平二十六日电】伦敦讯：因反对工党右翼领导而被开除出党的英国议员米尔斯廿三日在下议院演说时，严辞抨击英国政府追随美国的战争政策。米尔斯形容英国为“美国的附庸”，痛斥英国政府“在与美国协议下共同图谋便于美军占领英国的部署”。米尔斯质问海军部驻国会次官：究竟根据什么条款，什么条约，美国的“小鲸”号潜艇能在英国领海内与英国本海舰队的驱逐舰共同停泊一个月之久？米尔斯指出：如果这种行动被公开宣布，必将激起百万英国人民的愤恨和反对。
