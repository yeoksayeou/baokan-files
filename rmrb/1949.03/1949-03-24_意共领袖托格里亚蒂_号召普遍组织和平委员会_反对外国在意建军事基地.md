Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, March 22nd (TASS Rome, March 19th): The Italian Parliament's debate on the Gasperi government's decision to join the North Atlantic Treaty concluded at 4:00 PM on March 18th, forty-eight hours after the commencement of the previous parliamentary session. Italian Communist leader Togliatti and Socialist Party parliamentary group leader Nenni rose to speak; they were the last two of the one hundred and eighty speakers in this session. At the same time, newspaper extras carrying the North Atlantic Treaty were published in Rome. Several motorized police teams surrounded the parliament, and major thoroughfares in Rome were also blocked off.

　　Togliatti began by saying that this parliamentary session, contrary to usual parliamentary practice, continued for forty-eight hours in an atmosphere of tension and intensity. The constitution stipulates that the Italian Republic has no right to resort to war as a means of foreign policy. However, the ruling majority insists on concluding a war pact while refusing to submit the issue to a national referendum. Togliatti said to the government: You ghosts of "Munich," you are trying to deceive public opinion and prevent people from knowing that the Munich policy is to condone the forces preparing for war. It is the same thing as the North Atlantic Treaty.

　　Togliatti said that it is not enough to merely vote against this treaty. We will establish a great peace front in our country to coordinate with the peace fronts being formed in all countries around the world. We will form peace committees in every household, village, district, street, and among the working masses of all industries. If the constitution does not allow a national referendum on the ratification of this treaty, we will still seek all legal avenues to allow millions of Italian citizens the opportunity to express their desire for peace!

　　Togliatti proposed a motion requiring the government not to allow foreign countries to establish military strategic bases on Italian territory in accordance with the North Atlantic Treaty. Togliatti said that the establishment of military bases would mean inevitable war. Wherever there are aggressive imperialist military bases, war is brewing. This is the law of things. Furthermore, foreign troops maintaining bases on our territory will mean the beginning of our country's loss of independence, because it will mean foreign armed forces stationed in our country, and thus tomorrow they can interfere in Italian internal affairs and provoke conflicts with civilians. Togliatti concluded by emphatically declaring: "I demand that no foreign government be given the right to use any military base on our territory."

　　All opposition parliamentarians rose to cheer Togliatti. Christian Democratic parliamentarians remained silent and embarrassed.

　　Nenni then spoke, emphasizing that the decision the parliament intends to take "undermines all the foundations of the new Italian Republic's foreign policy and falls into the tradition of imperialism and fascism."

　　Nenni concluded by loudly saying that the struggle against the North Atlantic Treaty has only just begun! It begins with today's vote! We will make every effort to prevent you from using the treaty, we will use all our strength to create the most serious obstacles in your path, and we will do so because we are convinced that we are not only serving our own ideals, but above all serving the future of the country, the cause of peace, and the interests of our people!

    号召普遍组织和平委员会
    反对外国在意建军事基地
    【新华社陕北二十二日电】塔斯社罗马十九日讯：意大利议会对于加斯贝利政府决定参加北大西洋公约的辩论于三月十八日下午四时，即议会上次会议开始后的四十八小时结束，意共领袖托格里亚蒂和社会党议会党团主席南尼起立发言，他们是这次会议中一百八十名演说者中的最后两人，与此同时，载有北大西洋公约的报纸号外已在罗马出版。几营的摩托化警察队伍包围着议会，罗马市各通开大道也被封锁。
    托格里亚蒂首先说，这次议会和通常议事的情形相反，在紧张和激烈的空气中继续辩论了四十八小时。宪法中有一条规定意大利共和国无权采取战争作为外交政策的手段。然而，执政的多数党坚主缔结战争的公约，同时，更拒绝将这一问题付诸全民公决。托格里亚蒂对政府说：你们这些“慕尼黑”的幽灵，你们力图瞒过舆论不使人们知道：慕尼黑政策就是纵容准备战争的势力。它与北大西洋公约就是一个东西。
    托格里亚蒂说，仅仅投票反对这一公约是不够的，我们将在我国建立伟大的和平阵线，以配合正在全世界一切国家内形成的和平阵线。我们将在每家、每村、每区、每街以及各业劳动人民群众中组成和平委员会。如果说宪法不允许对这一公约的批准举行全民投票，我们仍将寻求一切合法的道路使意大利千百万公民有机会表示他们要求和平的意志！
    托格里亚蒂提出议案，要求规定政府不得依照北大西洋公约让外国在意大利领土上建立军事战略基地。托格里亚蒂说，因为建立军事基地将意味着不可避免的战争。那里有侵略性的帝国主义的军事基地，哪里就在酝酿着战争。这是事物的规律。此外，外国军队在我国领土保有基地，就将意味着我们国家丧失独立的开始，因为那将意味着外国武装部队驻地我国，这样，明天就可以干涉意大利内政，并挑起与平民之间的冲突。托格里亚蒂最后强调宣布说：“我要求：不给任何一个外国政府利用我国领土上的任何军事基地的权利。”
    一切反对党议员起立向托格里亚蒂欢呼。基督教民主党议员默不作声狼狈不堪。
    南尼随即发言，强调指出，议会打算采取的决定，“破坏了新意大利共和国外交政策的一切基础，堕入了帝制与法西斯主义的传统。”
    南尼最后高声说，反对北大西洋公约的斗争现在才开始！它是从今天的表决开始！我们将作一切努力使你们不可能使用公约，我们将用一切力量在你们的道路上造成最严重的障碍，我们将这样作，因为我们深信我们不仅是为自己的理想服务，而且首先是为国家的未来，和平事业和我国人民的利益服务！
