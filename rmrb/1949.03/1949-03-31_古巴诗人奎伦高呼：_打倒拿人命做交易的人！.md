　　Cuban poet Guillén delivered a moving speech. He said: "War is not spontaneous; it is man-made. War is a big business, a business that makes a fortune from the blood, bones, and lives of the people. Those who profit from war never lie in the trenches, never go to the battlefield. The forces of cruelty, ignorance, and selfishness, or those who are willing to trade in human lives on the exchange, are inciting a Third World War." This protest raised by the representative of the Cuban people, who are oppressed by imperialism, received a strong response from the entire audience.
　　John Roche, one of the leaders of the American Progressive Party, then addressed the audience through a loudspeaker. Roche said: "I am speaking to you as an American who is very disturbed by what is happening now within his country and beyond its borders." He said, "As far as I know, people are disgusted with war, atrocities, and destruction. I am convinced that the people of Europe do not want to participate in war. The rulers of European countries can promise to pay a lot for Marshall Plan dollars. But I am convinced that they will not be able to deliver. The United States can temporarily buy some allies by spending millions of dollars. However, the United States will not get real friends. The people of Europe need change. They will not maintain a corrupt autocratic system or a corrupt capitalist system. Our guns, our money, and our pressure may hinder this inevitable process of progress for a year, two years, or five years. But they cannot stop progress itself. I believe that our two different systems can coexist on one earth. Our peace conference must call for the establishment of a united front. It should be composed of all peace-loving people, regardless of their party affiliation, as long as they participate in efforts to stop the United States from heading towards war. This united front can force a change in our current policies. When Stalin announces that he is willing to conduct peace talks, the American people must tell Truman that the time for progressive peace talks has arrived."
　　Saxe Commins, the editor of the New York Post, said in his speech: The United States is rapidly heading down the road to war. The main factor making war even closer is the constant departure of American foreign policy from the United Nations, and the verbal praise of the United Nations Charter, while in practice undermining the United Nations institutions through the North Atlantic Treaty. The North Atlantic Treaty "is a war alliance created by the U.S. State Department," and "this treaty is the most dangerous treaty to peace among all the political treaties carried out in the halls of the United Nations institutions in history."
　　The first meeting of the plenary session of the conference ended after Saxe Commins's speech.

### 古巴诗人奎伦高呼：　打倒拿人命做交易的人！

　　古巴诗人奎伦高呼：
    打倒拿人命做交易的人！
    古巴诗人奎伦发表了动人的演说。他说：“战争不是自发的；它是人造的。战争是一笔大生意，是靠人民的鲜血、尸骨与生命来发财的生意。发战争财的人，从来不躺在战壕里，从来不上战场。凶残、愚恨与自私的力量，或那些愿意在交易所中做人命交易的人，正在煽动第三次世界大战。”受帝国主义压迫的古巴人民的代表所提出的这一抗议，受到了全场强烈的响应。
    美国进步党领袖之一的约翰·罗奇，继而在扩音器前致词。罗奇说：“我是作为这样一个美国人来向你们讲话的，这个美国人对于他的国家之内以及国境之外现在所发生的情况，感到非常不安。”他说，“据我所知，人民对于战争、暴行与破坏是厌恶的。我深信，欧洲人民不想参加战争。欧洲各国的统治者为了换取马歇尔计划的美元，可以答应付出许多东西。但我深信，他们将无法兑现。美国花成百万的美元，暂时还能够收买一些盟友。但是，美国是得不到真正朋友的。欧洲人民需要变革。他们将不维护腐朽的君主专制制度或腐化的资本主义制度。我们的枪炮、我们的金钱与我们的压力，可能阻挠这一必然的进步过程达一年，两年或五年。但是，它们阻止不了进步本身。我相信，我们两种不同的制度能够在一个地球上共存。我们的和平大会必须号召成立一个联合阵线。由一切爱好和平的人民组成，不问他们的党派，只要他们参加阻止美国走向战争的努力。这种联合阵线能够迫使我们目前的政策发生改变。当斯大林宣布他愿意进行和平谈判的时候，美国人民必须告诉杜鲁门说：进步和平谈判的时刻已经到了。”
    纽约邮报主编萨克雷致词说：美国已迅速走向战争的道路。使得战争更加深近的主要因素，是美国外交政策之不断背离联合国，以及在口头上赞扬联合国宪章。在实际行动上破坏联合国机构的北大西洋公约。北大西洋公约“是美国国务院制造的战争联盟”，“这个公约是历来在联合国机构之大厅进行的政治条约中对和平最危险的一个条约。”
    大会全会的第一次会议于萨克雷演说后结束。
