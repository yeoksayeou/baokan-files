To the Editor:

I have several questions I would like answered: ① Since the liberation, our shop's original manager has returned to his hometown, and the shop needs to replace the manager. I don't know which authority to apply to and what procedures to follow? ② How should we apply to change the original business's mark (such as Tong Shun Hao × mark)? ③ How should we apply for a new business license?

Mr. Hao Ran:

According to the "Provisional Measures for Industrial and Commercial Enterprises in the North China Region to Apply for Business Registration" promulgated on December 18, 1948, the following articles apply:

Article 2: Industrial and commercial enterprises must, twenty days before starting business, fill out an application form and apply for registration with the local county (city) industrial and commercial authority. After verification, a business license will be issued before business is permitted. However, if the aforementioned industrial and commercial enterprise is a company, the application for registration must be submitted to the local government for review by the administrative office (city) and then forwarded to the Industrial and Commercial Department of the North China People's Government for approval.

Article 3: The application form must state the following items:

	I. Name
	II. Type (sole proprietorship, partnership, company—limited, limited partnership, joint stock limited partnership, cooperative)
	III. Address
	IV. Manager
	V. Shareholders and shareholders' meetings
	VI. Manufacturing or business items
	VII. Date of establishment

If it is a company, the applicant must truthfully report the amount of capital. If there is an increase or decrease in the amount of registered capital after registration, a similar report must be submitted at any time.

Article 6: Those who cease business due to any reason must report to the industrial and commercial authority for approval in advance and return the original certificate for cancellation.

According to the above regulations, you can take the original business license to the Municipal Government's Bureau of Industry and Commerce to go through the procedures for cancellation and application for a new license.

　　新经营工商业户须向主管机关登记编辑先生：
    我现在有几个问题请答复：①解放后敝号因原铺长回他地，小号铺长需要更换，不知应向什么机关用什么手续呈请办理？②原商号记号（如同顺号×记）如何呈请更换？③新营业执照怎样呈请具领？　　　　
　　　　　浩然浩然先生：
    根据民国三十七年十二月十八日颁布的“华北区工商业申请营业登记暂行办法”有如下几条：
    第二条：工商业须于开业之二十日前填具申请书，向当地县（市）工商主管机关申请登记，经审查属实，发给营业证，方准营业。但前项工商业如系公司经营，申请登记时，须经当地政府呈请行署（市）复核后，转请华北人民政府工商部核准。
    第三条：申请书须载明左列事项：
    一、名称
    二、类别（独资、合伙、公司——有限、两合、股份两合、合作。）
    三、地址
    四、经理人
    五、股东与股东会
    六、制造或营业项目
    七、创设年月
    如系公司经营，申请人须将资本额具实呈报。登记后之资本额遇有增减情况发生时，亦须随时为同样之呈报。
    第六条：因故歇业者，须于事前呈报工商主管机关批准，并缴销原证。
    根据上项规定，你持原号营业证，前往本市市政府工商局办理缴销与申请登记新号手续即可。
