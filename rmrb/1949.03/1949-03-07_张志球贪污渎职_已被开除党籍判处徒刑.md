　　Zhang Zhiqiu Embezzled and Neglected His Duty
    Has Been Expelled from the Party and Sentenced to Imprisonment
    [Xinhua News Agency, Kaifeng, 5th] Zhang Zhiqiu, Deputy Section Chief of the Investigation Section of the Kaifeng Municipal Materials Management Committee, was given the penalties of expulsion from the Party and imprisonment for embezzlement, dereliction of duty, corruption, and degeneration in his work. Zhang Zhiqiu is from Liu'an County, Anhui Province, is 29 years old, of middle peasant background, and from a small merchant family. He joined the Chinese People's Liberation Army in 1939 and the Chinese Communist Party in 1940. He successively held positions in the army as squad leader, political instructor of a company, deputy section chief of the Mass Movement Section of the Political Department of a brigade, director of the supply department of a regiment, and deputy director of a county industry and commerce bureau. In 1942, he received a warning from the Party for embezzlement and prostitution. In 1946, he again showed independence from the Party and disobeyed the organization, for which he was punished with suspension of Party membership. Last November, Zhang Zhiqiu was transferred from the Central Henan-Anhui-Jiangsu Sub-bureau of the CPC to Kaifeng, where he served as Deputy Section Chief of the Investigation Section of the Materials Management Committee. In his work, he again seriously violated the discipline of the Chinese Communist Party and the laws of the People's Government, embezzling 1.6 taels of gold, more than 50 silver dollars, 2,700 yuan of Zhongzhou banknotes, as well as quilts, leather shoes, thermos bottles, cigarettes, and many other items. At the same time, he had no class standpoint or political vigilance in his work and even had an affair with the woman of a Kuomintang secret agent, frequented prostitutes; and was often drawn in by others, drinking, watching operas, giving gifts to each other, and living a corrupt life. Another mistake of Zhang Zhiqiu was that he was arrogant and conceited in his work, disregarding the organization, such as confiscating private cars without authorization, neither consulting with colleagues at the same level nor asking for instructions from superiors, acting arbitrarily. After these serious errors occurred, the superiors immediately suspended Zhang Zhiqiu's work, and the CPC Kaifeng Municipal Party Committee Directly Subordinate Organs Committee and the administrative负责人of the Materials Management Committee talked to him many times, urging him to reflect and educating him to recognize his mistakes. However, he instead made excuses and argued strongly, showing no remorse, until the superiors produced evidence, after which he was forced to admit his mistakes. The CPC Kaifeng Municipal Committee believes that the mistakes made by Zhang Zhiqiu are extremely serious, and they have damaged the political influence of the Chinese Communist Party. In order to strictly enforce Party discipline and purify the Party ranks, it was decided to expel Zhang Zhiqiu from the Party, dismiss him from his post, and hand him over to the People's Court for punishment according to law. The above decision has been approved by the Central Henan-Anhui-Jiangsu Sub-bureau of the CPC and the Central Plains Bureau of the CPC. Zhang Zhiqiu was interrogated by the Kaifeng Municipal People's Court last month and has been sentenced to two years of imprisonment and one year of deprivation of political rights. Most of the embezzled funds and items have been returned to the Materials Management Committee.

　　张志球贪污渎职
    已被开除党籍判处徒刑
    【新华社开封五日电】开封市物资管理委员会调查科副科长张志球，在工作中贪污渎职，腐化坠落，受到开除党籍和判处徒刑的处分。张志球是安徽省六安县人，现年二十九岁，中农成份，小商人出身。他于一九三九年参加中国人民解放军，一九四○年加入中国共产党。他在军队中历任班长、连政治指导员、旅政治部民运科副科长、团供给处主任、县工商局副局长等职，一九四二年他因为贪污嫖妓，曾经受党的警告处分。一九四六年又向党闹独立性，违抗组织，受过停止党籍的处分。去年十一月，张志球从中共豫皖苏中央分局调来开封，担任物资管理委员会调查科副科长职务。他在工作中又严重地违反了中国共产党的纪律和人民政府的法令，贪污黄金一两六钱、银元五十多枚，中州钞二千七百元，以及花被单、皮鞋、热水瓶、纸烟等许多东西。同时，他在工作中毫无阶级立场和政治警惕性，竟和国民党特务分子的女人勾搭，嫖妓女；并经常受人拉拢、喝酒、看戏、互相送礼，生活腐化。张志球的另一错误，是在工作中自高自大，目无组织，如私自没收私人汽车等，既不和同级商量，也不向上级请示，任意胡为。上述这些严重错误发生后，上级即停止张志球的工作，并由中共开封市党委直属机关委会和物资管理委员会行政负责人多次和他谈话，督促他反省，教育他认识自己的错误。但他反而推诿强辩，毫无悔悟之心，直至上级拿出证据之后，他才被迫承认自己的错误。中共开封市委认为张志球所犯错误是极其严重的，它损害了中国共产党的政治影响。为了严肃党的纪律，纯洁党的队伍，乃决定开除张志球的党籍，撤消他的职务，并送交人民法院依法处罪。上述决定，业经中共豫皖苏中央分局和中共中原中央局批准。张志球于上月经开封市人民法院提审后，已判处有期徒刑两年，褫夺公权一年。至贪污款物，大部已归还物资管理委员会。
