Xinhua News Agency, North China, 24th—The grain and flour industry in Zhangjiakou City has achieved great development since liberation. The daily input of grain and flour output now exceeds the city's previous record high. The grain and flour industry is a major industry in Zhangjiakou City, and most of the grain from rural areas in Chahar Province is transported to Zhangjiakou City to exchange for daily necessities for farmers. Currently, the average daily grain input from Chahar Province to Zhangjiakou City reaches 5,000 shi. The city has six state-owned electric flour mills and 123 private flour mills (64 of which are electric mills, producing more than 90,000 catties of flour daily). Before the "July 7th" Incident, the city's annual grain input was about 800,000 to 1,000,000 shi, averaging about 2,700 shi per day. There were more than 30 large and small flour mills, with a daily output of more than 50,000 catties of flour. During the period of Japanese invaders and Kuomintang reactionary rule, the maximum annual grain input was 300,000 shi. The flour output was 30,000 catties per day.

　　张市粮面业获巨大发展
    【新华社华北二十四日电】解放后的张家口市之粮面业获得巨大发展，现每日输入粮及面粉产量均超过该市以往的最高纪录。粮面业为张市主要行业，察北各地农村粮食大部均运往张市交换农民日用品。现察北粮食输入张市者，每日平均达五千市石。全市有公营电磨面粉厂六家、私人面粉厂一百二十三家（其中六十四座为电磨，每日共产面粉九万多斤）。“七七”事变前，该市全年输入粮约八十至一百万市石，平均每日约为二千七百余市石。大小面粉厂有三十余家，日产面粉五万多斤。在日寇及国民党反动统治时，每年输入粮最多则为三十万市石。面粉产量则为每日三万斤。
