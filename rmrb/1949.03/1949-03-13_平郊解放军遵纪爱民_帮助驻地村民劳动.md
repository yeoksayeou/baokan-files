Xinhua News Agency, Beiping, March 9th: A certain unit of the North China Liberation Army stationed in the suburbs of Beiping actively helps local villagers with labor and assists in household construction. The Sixth Squad of the Special Service Company directly under a certain division carried 120 loads of manure in one day. Chen Laodong, a soldier from another company, made two spinning wheels for his landlord. The troops stationed in Changle Village repaired a pigpen and stacked hay for the villager Old Lady Li. Most families housing soldiers received water carried by the troops. Li Fengxian, a soldier from the Ninth Company of a certain regiment, carried water for his landlord 140 times in over a month. In order to respect local customs, each squad and platoon established military toilets, vacated rooms for landlords during the New Year, paid New Year visits, and invited military dependents and landlords to meals. Because of the Liberation Army's actions of observing discipline and loving the people, they have earned the love of the local people, who regard the troops as their own family. When Hou Weizhen, a communication员 from the First Company, fell ill, his landlady not only personally brought water and cooked food but also went to other villages to find medicine; while Kang Leshan, the deputy captain of the propaganda team, was away working, his landlord secretly took apart and washed his overcoat. During the Lantern Festival, the Third Battalion held a large meeting, and the villagers from Xilitun, where they were originally stationed, also came to participate. At the meeting, village representatives presented the troops with a banner that read "Model People's Liberation Army." When the meeting ended late into the night, many younger villagers from Xilitun still held onto the soldiers' hands, reluctant to leave. Zhao Baokui, the child of the landlord of the Machine Gun Third Company, climbed into the arms of squad leader Li Taiyu and pulled out the four gifts his grandmother had sent him one by one: two bundles of thread, two boxes of matches, two needles, and three packs of cigarettes, insisting that the soldiers visit his home often when they had time.

　　平郊解放军遵纪爱民
  　帮助驻地村民劳动
    【新华社北平九日电】驻防北平郊外的华北解放军某部，积极帮助驻地村民劳动，协助建设家务。某师师直属队特务连六班一天起粪一百二十担。另一个连战士陈老东给房东做了两架纺车。住在常乐村的部队，给村民李老太太修了猪圈，又垒了草堆。凡住有军队的人家，大多都吃上了部队给担的水。某团九连战士李凤贤一个多月给房东担水达一百四十担。为了尊重当地风俗习惯，各班排都建立了军人厕所，过年都给房东腾房子，拜年，请军属和房东吃饭。由于解放军的遵纪爱民的行动，得到了当地人民的热爱，他们都把部队看做自家人。一连通讯员侯维珍患病，房东老太太不但亲自送水，做饭，还到外村去找药；宣传队副队长康乐善的大衣放在家里，房东在他外出工作的几天里偷偷地给拆洗了。元宵节三营开大会，原先驻村西里屯的老乡也赶来参加，会上村代表给部队献上一面写着“模范人民解放军”的旗子，大会开到天黑时，好多西里屯村民小弟弟还拉住战士们的手不肯散开。机枪三连的房东小孩赵保奎，爬在一班长李太玉的怀里，一件件的掏出他祖母派他送来的四色礼物：两结线、两盒洋火、两个针、三包纸烟，临走时还要战士们有空常去他家玩。
