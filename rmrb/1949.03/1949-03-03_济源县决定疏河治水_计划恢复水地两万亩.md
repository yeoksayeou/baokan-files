[Taiyue Electric] The Jiyuan County government has formulated this year's water conservancy construction plan, which aims to restore 20,000 mu of irrigated land throughout the county, transform 1,600 mu of waterlogged land, and increase grain production by 20,000 shi from the irrigated land. Jiyuan County has a network of rivers and many canals. The masses have rich water conservancy experience. Before the War of Resistance, there were more than 58,400 mu of irrigated land. However, it was severely damaged by the Japanese invaders and Chiang Kai-shek bandits during the war. Although the democratic government has led the masses to rush repairs over the years and restored and preserved more than 30,000 mu of irrigated land, due to objective conditions and imperfect organizational structure, many canals have not been thoroughly dredged. Currently, approximately 28,100 mu of the original irrigated land cannot be used for irrigation. At the same time, due to the silting of river channels, whenever there is heavy rain, the river water overflows and floods crops. For example, the Yongli and Guangji rivers overflowed the banks the year before last, flooding more than 6,700 mu of autumn crops. Therefore, the government has decided this year to vigorously repair rivers and canals, divert water for irrigation, and prevent flooding and scouring. The specific engineering plan will first focus on repairing the Yongli River canal, planning to excavate the riverbed to a bottom width of 12 feet, a height and depth of 7 feet, and a length of 8,200 zhang. At the same time, the original river mouth will be repaired, and a new intake will be built to allow a large amount of water to be drawn. In this way, 15,210 mu of irrigated land can be increased. Secondly, the Lifeng River, Guangji River and other canals will also be repaired, with a plan to increase irrigated land by 3,490 mu on the original basis. In addition, it is also necessary to restore and develop water conservancy undertakings such as waterwheels, pulley wells, lever-operated water carrying for irrigation, water mills, water-powered cotton fluffing, and cotton ginning. It is required that the county increase the area irrigated by waterwheels and pulley wells by 2,000 mu this year. Upon completion of the above plans, calculated at 5 dou per mu, the irrigated land can increase grain production by 20,000 shi this year. In addition, there are specific plans for flood and erosion prevention, which can save 3,000 mu of flooded land and expand cultivated land by 10,000 mu. The government has now decided to issue 1,041 shi of grain loans to mobilize the masses to carry out the work.

　　济源县决定疏河治水
  　计划恢复水地两万亩
    【太岳电】济源县政府订出了今年水利建设计划，计划全县恢复水地两万亩。改造泊地一千六百亩，水地增产粮食两万石。济源全县河流纵横。渠道很多，群众有丰富的水利经验，在抗战以前，有水地五万八千四百多亩，但在战争中，被日寇和蒋匪破坏的很厉害，民主政府历年领导群众抢修，虽恢复保存了水地三万多亩，但因客观条件限制，和组织机构不健全，好多渠道没有彻底疏通，现在约有二万八千一百亩原来的水地，还不能引水浇地。同时，因河道渠道的淤塞，每遇大雨，河水出岸就要淹没庄稼。如前年永利、广济两河出岸，就淹没了六千七百多亩秋禾。因此，政府今年决定：大力修复河道和渠道，引水浇地，防淹防冲。具体工程计划，首先着重修复永利河渠道，计划要挖通河身，做到底宽一丈二尺，高深七尺，挖长八千二百丈。同时要修理原河口，再新筑一个吃水口，使能大量吃水。这样，就可增加水地一万五千二百一十亩。其次，对利丰河、广济河等渠道，也要进行修治，计划在原有基础上，增加水浇地三千四百九十亩。另外，还要恢复发展水车、辘轳井、压杆挑水浇地、水磨、水打弹花、轧花等水利事业。要求全县今年增加水车辘轳浇地两千亩。完成以上各项计划，每亩以五斗计算，今年水地就可增加粮食两万石。此外，防水防冲，亦订有具体计划，可以救出水淹地三千亩及扩大良田一万亩。现政府决定发放贷粮一千零四十一石，发动群众进行。
