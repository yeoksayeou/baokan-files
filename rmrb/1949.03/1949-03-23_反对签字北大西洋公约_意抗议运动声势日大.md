Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, March 21st: TASS, Rome, March 17th: The protests against the government's decision to join the North Atlantic Treaty are gaining momentum among the Italian people. All major industrial enterprises in Rome went on strike on March 16th to protest the North Atlantic Treaty. All factory committees of each enterprise participated in signing the declaration of the Italian General Confederation of Labour (CGIL) Executive Committee. Temporary protest rallies against the North Atlantic Treaty were held in the markets of Rome on March 16th and 17th. Leaflets against war preparations and the North Atlantic Treaty were distributed in movie theaters. Fearing further development of mass demonstrations, 500 soldiers and motorcycle police teams were ordered to guard all streets and squares adjacent to the parliament, where the North Atlantic Treaty is currently under discussion. A delegation representing 200,000 metalworkers from Milan has arrived in Rome to visit the Speaker of the Chamber of Deputies, Gronchi, and the Speaker of the Senate, Bonomi, to deliver a statement protesting participation in the North Atlantic Treaty. The delegation includes two Christian Democratic worker party members.

Workers at the Venziti factory in Milan delivered the following letter to the U.S. Ambassador to Italy, Dunn. The letter stated: "Report to your government that the workers of the Venziti factory oppose the North Atlantic Treaty, a treaty of war. We will never recognize the validity of the government's signature. We will never sign this treaty."

A rally protesting the North Atlantic Treaty was held in Pavia (northwest of Turin), attended by over 30,000 people. A women's demonstration was held in Florence. Protest strikes were held in many industrial centers in Tuscany. Large-scale mass rallies protesting participation in the North Atlantic Treaty were held in Salerno (southeast of Naples) and Bari.
