Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, 12th: The more than 4,500 employees of China Textile Company's No. 7 Factory were left without work due to the factory's destruction by the Kuomintang bandit troops during the Tianjin Campaign. The People's Government has now provided appropriate resettlement. Bandit Chief Chen Changjie forcibly requisitioned the factory's materials to build fortifications and constructed artillery positions within the factory, resulting in severe damage, making full restoration impossible within six months. Since liberation, among the 4,500+ employees, except for the 300+ who have been transferred to other China Textile factories and the small number that the partially restored No. 7 Factory can accommodate, the majority have become unemployed. The People's Government is extremely concerned about them. Since liberation, the remaining employees have been receiving half their monthly salary to maintain their livelihood. It was originally planned to assemble the remaining 15,000 spindles from China Textile Factories No. 1 and No. 2, along with the 10,000 spindles and 500 looms that No. 7 Factory can repair, which could accommodate over 1,200 people. However, the renovation work will take another six months. To ensure the long-term stability of the workers' lives, the People's Government and the Tianjin Office of the Preparatory Committee of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions have determined the following resettlement measures: Those willing to change professions will receive three months' wages. If the total is less than 1,000 jin of corn, it will be raised to 1,000 jin. Whether they engage in small businesses or return home to farm, the government will be responsible for introducing them to the local government for assistance. The factory will also issue certificates, allowing them to return to work at the factory after it is rebuilt in the future. Other factories under China Textile Company will also prioritize hiring them when increasing their workforce. Huang Kecheng, Director of the Military Control Commission, and Huang Jing, Mayor, visited the factory on the 3rd of this month to express their sympathy to the employees, explaining the current difficulties faced by the government and the reasons why No. 7 Factory cannot be restored immediately. They told them that not only will No. 7 Factory be restored, but more factories will be built in the future. They hoped that after returning home, they would use the three months' wages they received to engage in production and maintain close contact with the factory, so that the factory could notify them as soon as there was work available. The workers expressed their appreciation for these reasonable measures taken by the People's Government.

　　天津市人民政府妥善安置中纺七厂工人
    【新华社天津十二日电】中国纺织公司第七厂职工四千五百余人由于该厂在天津战役中被国民党匪军摧毁因而无工可做，刻人民政府已予适当的安置。陈匪长捷于天津战役中，强制征用该厂物资修筑工事，并在该厂构筑炮兵阵地，致该厂遭受严重摧毁，半年内已无全部恢复可能。解放以来，该厂四千五百余职工中，除三百余人已转入中纺其他各厂、及七厂已恢复部分可容纳少数职工外，大部均告失业。人民政府对他们极为关怀。解放以来，对留厂职工仍按月发给半数薪金维持生活。原拟中纺一厂、二厂所余的一万五千纱锭和七厂尚能修复的一万纱锭及五百台布机装配以后，将可容纳一千二百余人，但装修工程又需时半年。为了安定工人的长期生活，人民政府与华北总工会筹委会天津办事处已确定安置办法如下：愿转业者发放三个月工资，其总合不足千斤玉米者，一律发给千斤，无论其经营小本生意或回家耕种，政府均将负责介绍当地政府予以协助。厂方并发给证明文件，俟将来工厂重建后，仍可返厂工作。中纺公司所属其他厂增加职工时，亦将尽先吸收。军管会主任黄克诚与市长黄敬曾于本月三日亲临该厂慰问职工，向他们解释政府目前的困难及七厂一时不能复工的原因，告诉他们：不但七厂要恢复，而且将来要建设更多的工厂，希望他们散回家后，将所发的三个月工资去好好进行生产；并多与工厂保持联系，以便工厂方面一有工作就通知他们。工人们对人民政府此种合理措施均表赞扬。
