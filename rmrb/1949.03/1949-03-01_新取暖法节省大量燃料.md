TASS, Moscow, 4th—Approximately three hundred buildings and schools in the capital will soon be supplied with heat from the central power station. This heating method on a large scale was proposed more than twenty years ago. The hot water discharged from the boilers of the city's power stations used to flow into the river, but now it can be used for heating. Water heated to 150 degrees Celsius will flow from the power station to the buildings through pipes under high pressure. The new heating method will save a large amount of fuel. This year, the use of this heating method in three hundred buildings will save approximately 40,000 tons of coal, the transportation of which requires two thousand railway cars. This heating method is three times cheaper than other central heating methods. By the end of this year, one thousand buildings in the Soviet capital will adopt this new method.

　　新取暖法节省大量燃料
    【塔斯社莫斯科四日电】首都的大楼及学校约三百处不久即将得到中央发电站的热力供应。早在二十多年前就有人提议大规模采用这种取暖方法。从本市各电站汽锅里放出来的热水从前都流到河里去了，但现在却可用来取暖。热至摄氏一百五十度的水将在高压力下沿着水管从电站流到建筑物里。新取暖法将节省大量燃料。今年在三百座大楼里采用这种取暖法将节省煤炭约四万吨，其运输需要两千个火车厢。这种取暖法较别的中心取暖法便宜三倍。截至今年末，苏联首都将有一千座建筑采用这种新法。
