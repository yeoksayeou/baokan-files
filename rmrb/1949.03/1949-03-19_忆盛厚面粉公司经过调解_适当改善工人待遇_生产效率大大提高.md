　　Yishenghou Flour Company Improves Workers' Treatment Appropriately After Mediation; Production Efficiency Greatly Increased
　　[Our Newspaper] Recently, the Yishenghou Flour Company in Ping City reasonably resolved a labor-capital dispute. Workers' treatment was appropriately improved, boosting production morale and increasing output. The factory owner also gained more profit than before. In the past, the company's methods for profit-sharing, wages, and working hours were all unreasonable. For example, regarding profit-sharing, it was originally stipulated that bonuses would be issued three times a year: during the Dragon Boat Festival, the Mid-Autumn Festival, and the New Year. At the end of last year, the factory did not distribute bonuses, nominally letting the workers become shareholders, using the bonuses to buy shares. In reality, only those with more than 40 shares had the right to inspect the accounts, while the total number of shares held by the workers was less than 20. This was clearly the factory owner's attempt to deceive the workers. After the liberation of Beiping, the workers resolutely demanded the return of the year-end bonus, and the factory owner then returned the bonus to the workers. The factory's wages were extremely low in the past. In July of last year, the foreman's monthly income was 5 million pseudo-currency, which could only buy half a bag of flour. By November, the highest-paid worker could only buy 0.7 bags of flour, and the lowest-paid could only buy 1.5 jin (0.75 kg). The workers' lives were too hard, and they were very dissatisfied. At the time of liberation, the factory owner proposed that all workers receive half a bag of flour, regardless of their rank, but the workers did not accept this. After mediation, it was stipulated that skilled workers would receive 1.5 bags of flour per month, and workers and apprentices would receive one bag each. Working hours were reduced from 16 hours a day to 12 hours. After this reasonable adjustment, the workers' work morale increased, and production increased. In 1948, the factory's highest daily output was 70 bags of flour, with an average of 60 bags. Now, the minimum output is 70 bags, the average is 87 bags, and the maximum is 90 bags. Daily output has increased by 47% compared to before. From the Dragon Boat Festival to the Mid-Autumn Festival in 1948, the ratio of the factory's net profit to the total cost was 8.7%. After the wage adjustment, the ratio increased to 9.2%. This fact demonstrates that the New Democratic economic policy of benefiting both labor and capital is beneficial to both parties.

　　忆盛厚面粉公司经过调解
    适当改善工人待遇　生产效率大大提高
    【本报讯】平市忆盛厚面粉公司最近合理解决了劳资纠纷，工人待遇适当改善，生产情绪提高，产量增多，厂主较前也获得了较多的利润。在过去，该厂所订的分红、工资及工作时间等办法，均有不合理的地方。譬如分红，原规定每年分端午、中秋及年节三次发给，去年年底该厂未分红利，名义上让工人作股东，以红利入股，实际上超过四十股的才有查帐权，而工人的红利总数还不到二十股，显然是厂主想欺骗工人。北平解放后，工人坚决要求发还年底红利，厂主才把红利发还给工人。该厂工资过去极低：去年七月时，工头每月收入伪法币五百万元，仅能买半袋面，到十一月，工资最高的才能买到百分之七袋面，最低的只能买一斤五两。工人生活太苦，非常不满。解放时，厂主提出工人一律半袋面，不分等级，工人未接受。调解后，规定技工每月一袋半面，工人学徒每人一袋。工作时间从每日十六小时，改为十二小时。经过此次合理调整，工人工作情绪增高，产量增加，该厂一九四八年度每日最高出产七十袋面粉，平均为六十袋；现在起码出七十袋，平均为八十七袋，最高为九十袋。日产量较前提高百分之四十七。在一九四八年端午节到中秋节厂方净利与总成本的比例为百分之八点七；工资调整后，比例增加为百分之九点二。这一事实，说明了劳资两利的新民主主义经济政策对劳资双方都是有利的。
