    Red Navy News Comments on the "Mediterranean Group"
    [Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 24th] TASS, Moscow: Red Navy News, in a commentary on the American-engineered "Mediterranean Group" plan, declared: The United States' recent military and diplomatic activities in the Mediterranean have become even more intense. The American rulers are attempting to expand and strengthen their economic, political, and military positions in the Mediterranean, while also intending to further penetrate Africa, which possesses vast strategic resources. American military adventurers regard the Mediterranean as a springboard for aggression against the Soviet Union and the People's Democratic countries of Eastern Europe. According to the plans of the "Mediterranean Group" creators, Franco's Spain and Turkey will assume the tasks of maritime "bridgehead fortresses" in the western and eastern Mediterranean. Turkish seaports are being rapidly renovated, and the United States has military advisors and instructors stationed in Turkey. All of this is to turn Turkey into an outpost of the United States in the eastern Mediterranean. To realize America's conspiracy in the Mediterranean, Italy will also be assigned special tasks. The author concludes: However, this American aggressive conspiracy will encounter growing resistance from the people of the Mediterranean countries. The people of the Mediterranean coast do not want the Mediterranean to become an "American Lake."

    红海军报评“地中海集团”
    【新华社陕北二十四日电】塔斯社莫斯科讯：红海军报在评论美国策动的“地中海集团”计划时宣称：美国最近在地中海的军事与外交活动，已更加紧张。美国统治者企图扩大并加强他们在地中海的经济、政治与军事阵地，同时打算进一步深入拥有大量战略资源的非洲。美国军事冒险家把地中海看作是侵略苏联和东欧人民民主国家的跳板。根据“地中海集团”制造者的计划，佛朗哥西班牙与土耳其将担负地中海西面与东面海上“桥头堡垒”的任务，土耳其的海港正被急促地修整，美国在土耳其驻有军事顾问和教官。这一切都是为着变土耳其为美国在地中海东部的前哨。为了实现美国在地中海的阴谋，意大利亦将被赋以特殊的任务。作者结语称：然而，美国这种侵略阴谋，将遭到地中海国家人民日益增长的抵抗。地中海沿岸的人民，不愿意地中海变成“美国湖”
