　　North China to Vigorously Afforest This Year, Planning to Plant 20 Million Trees
　　North China People's Government Department of Agriculture and Forestry Formulates a Plan
　　[This Newspaper's Report] The North China People's Government's Department of Agriculture has formulated a plan: This year, forestry construction will be carried out with greater force than in previous years. The entire region plans to plant a total of 24.45 million trees (requiring a survival rate of over 70%), focusing on establishing windbreak forest belts and carrying out sand control afforestation with 2.6 million trees. In addition, over 10,000 mu of barren mountains will be afforested by seeding, gradually transforming poor mountains into prosperous forestry and pastoral areas. This marks the beginning of a planned and organized struggle against sand and mountain wastelands, aiming to gradually overcome wind and sand, flooding, and improve the people's well-being. At the same time, it is required to establish over 2,700 mu of nurseries to supply seedlings needed for afforestation. In order to effectively complete the afforestation plan, North China will set up six specialized organizations to lead and manage forestry, strengthen forestry administration, and issue forestry loans of 100 million yuan (People's Currency), specifically for sand control afforestation, nurseries, and forestry companies (collecting medicinal materials, mushrooms, dry distillation, manufacturing agricultural tools, hunting, etc.) to support the masses in developing forestry. It also emphasizes implementing afforestation in three seasons (spring, summer, and autumn) throughout the year. If the masses have afforestation demands, as long as there are dedicated personnel in charge of leadership (such as the Hebei Central Afforestation Team), solving technical, seedling, and forest protection issues, and carrying out in-depth organizational work (making more use of cooperative forms and rational old organizations such as forestry associations), the mass afforestation movement can be widely carried out, and the survival rate can also be improved.

　　华北今年大力造林　计划植树两千万株
    华北人民政府农林部订出计划
    【本报讯】华北人民政府农业部已订出计划：今年以超过往年的力量进行林业建设。全区计划重点与一般造林共二千四百四十五万株（要求成活率在百分之七十以上），其中计划建立防风林带的起点，进行砂荒造林二百六十万株，另荒山播种造林一万余亩，使穷山逐步变成富庶的林牧区。这是有计划有组织地与砂荒、山荒进行斗争的开端，以期逐渐克服风砂水泛，增进人民的福利。同时要求建立苗圃二千七百余亩，供给造林所需苗木，为了切实完成造林计划，今年华北区分设六个领导管理林业的专门组织，加强林业行政，发放林贷一亿元（人民券），专用于砂荒造林、苗圃、林产公司（采药材、蘑菇、干镏、农具制造、狩猎等），以扶助群众发展林业。并强调贯彻一年三季（春、夏、秋）造林。群众有造林要求，只要有专人负责领导（如冀中造林队），解决技术、林苗、护林等问题，进行深入的组织工作（多利用合作形式及合理的旧组织如林会等），群众的造林运动即可广泛开展，成活率亦可提高。
