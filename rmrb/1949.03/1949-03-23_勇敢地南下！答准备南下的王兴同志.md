　　Bravely Go South!
    Reply to Comrade Wang Xing Who is Preparing to Go South

To the Editor:
    I am still hesitating whether to resolutely sign up to go south. I would like to share my thoughts and hope you can help me. I am a young man in my twenties, a poor peasant who has just been liberated, and I have now been promoted to a district cadre. My family has enough to eat and drink, and there are people to take care of them. I have also studied to the equivalent of upper primary school level in the past few years. In this situation of national victory, I am very willing to sign up to go south to help liberate the people of Jiangnan. However, I have heard rumors that northerners who go to the south suffer from acclimatization and get sick. There are many mosquitoes in the summer, like horseflies, and I don't understand the language, which has shaken my resolve. I would like to ask: are these rumors true?
　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　Wang Xingqi

Comrade Wang Xing:

    It is good that you frankly stated your wishes and difficulties. There may be others who have the same thoughts as you. We are very moved by your willingness to help liberate the laboring people of Jiangnan. This is a concrete manifestation of the increased awareness of our peasants after liberation. We hope you will bravely go south! The people of Jiangnan are eagerly awaiting your help to liberate them. As for your inquiry about the rumors about Jiangnan, we reply as follows, based on what we know:

    Some northerners who go to the south do get sick due to acclimatization, but it is by no means as terrible as people say. This is just like the rumors that southerners heard before coming to the north, such as: the north is so cold that you can't show your face, you wear fur coats in the summer, and there are big sandstorms. But when they came, it wasn't that serious, and they gradually got used to it. Aren't there many of our old comrades who are southerners who persevered through the eight years of the War of Resistance and the three years of the Liberation War, and are still living well? It is also true that there are many mosquitoes in the south, but they are not as scary as they say. At the same time, mosquito nets and mosquito coils can be used for protection. Generally speaking, when you first arrive in a place, you have to change your living habits to adapt, and you will gradually get used to it over time. Didn't the southern comrades in the north eat millet and endure the cold weather? Not understanding the language is also temporary. If you have more contact with the masses, you will soon understand. The people in the new areas have been oppressed and exploited for a long time, and they are eagerly hoping for your help. Therefore, as long as we are determined to serve the people, we will definitely be able to overcome everything. As long as everyone learns with an open mind and works hard, we will only be welcomed. How could there be any reason to be looked down upon? What do you think?

### 勇敢地南下！答准备南下的王兴同志

专栏：询问与答覆

　　勇敢地南下！
    答准备南下的王兴同志编辑同志：
    我现仍在犹豫，是否我坚决的报名南下。我把个人的思想谈一下，希望能帮我解答。我是个二十多岁的青年，刚翻身的贫农，现已被提拔为区干部；家里够吃够喝，也有人照顾，几年来也学习的相当于高小的文化程度。在这样全国胜利的形势下，自己很愿意报名南下，帮助解放江南的人民。但听传说：北方人到了南方水土不服光生病。夏天蚊子很多，象大头苍蝇样，说话又不懂，这样又动摇了我的决心。请问：这种传说对不对呢？
    　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　王兴启王兴同志：
    你坦白地说出了你的志愿和困难，这是很好的，象有你这样想法的人可能还有的，你愿意帮助解放江南的劳动人民，我们很受感动，这正是我们翻身后农民觉悟提高的具体表现。希望你勇敢的南下吧！江南的人民正渴望着你们前去帮助解放。至于所询关于江南的传说，据我们所知答复如下：
    北方人到南方有因不服水土而生病的，但这决不象人们所传说的那样了不起。这正如南方人来到北方以前，也有一种什么传说一样。如说：北方冷得露不出脸来，夏天穿皮袄，风沙大等。但他们来到后，并不那样严重，而且慢慢地也习惯了。咱们的老同志中不是有很多南方人，坚持了八年抗战、三年解放战争，而且现在生活得很好吗？南方蚊子多也是事实，但却没有说的那么可怕，同时有了蚊帐蚊烟等设备也可以防御。一般的说，初到一个地方，生活习惯总得有些改变方可适应，日久也便习以为常；在北方的南方同志不是小米也吃了，冷天也过了吗？语言不懂也是短时的，多和群众接触，不久就会懂的。新区人民长期受压迫剥削，正殷切地希望你们帮助，因此，只要我们下定为人民服务的决心，便一定可以战胜一切。只要大家虚心学习，努力工作，只有被人欢迎，那有被人轻视的道理？不知你以为如何？
