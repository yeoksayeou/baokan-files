　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 16th: TASS, Paris: The peace movement in France has become a truly national people's movement. The broadest strata of people, of different faiths, are uniting around the Communist Party, the mainstay in the struggle for peace. In many cities, workers have staged short strikes, passing resolutions demanding peace. The recently established National Committee of Cultural Workers of France has published an open letter to intellectuals nationwide, calling on them to participate in the Peace Defense Congress. Local committees of French cultural workers have begun electing delegates. French scientists, writers, and artists have organized a national movement, signing letters to US President Truman expressing opposition to the US military adventure policy. Parisian women have launched a signature campaign for a "Peace Handbook." Parisian students held a demonstration on the central square on the 11th. The main slogan of the demonstration was "Peace for Vietnam!" On the 12th, the National Association of Veterans of the People's Relief Society (representing over 20,000 members), the General Association of Engineers and Administrative Staff, the FAXI (Spanish) Association, and many other groups, along with many prominent French intellectuals, expressed their desire to participate in the upcoming Peace Defense Congress.
