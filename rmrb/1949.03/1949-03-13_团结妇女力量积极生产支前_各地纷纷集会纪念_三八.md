　　Uniting Women's Strength to Actively Produce and Support the Front
    Various Regions Hold Gatherings to Commemorate "March 8th"
    Zhangjiakou
    [Zhangyuan Electric] Under the leadership of the Zhangjiakou Municipal Women's Federation, women from all walks of life in Zhangjiakou City held gatherings from the 27th of last month to the 3rd of this month to discuss how to greet the first "March 8th" festival after the liberation of Zhangjiakou with practical actions. During the five days, the Municipal Women's Federation held 26 symposiums and mass meetings in different forms, including female workers, workers' families, families of revolutionary martyrs and soldiers, hospitals, and citizens. Women in government offices enthusiastically discussed how to study diligently, do their jobs well, strengthen their self-cultivation and exercise to improve themselves, and overcome others' underestimation of them from a positive perspective. They also put forward many suggestions for improving their work. Female workers, workers' families, and citizens discussed how to actively labor, work hard, and improve their family and social status. Families of military industrial workers were preparing to write letters to their sons or husbands, urging them to bravely kill the enemy, work with peace of mind, and eliminate the Kuomintang reactionaries to achieve true peace as soon as possible. After the symposium, the enthusiasm for learning and work of all women cadres in the trading company has been significantly improved.
    Shijiazhuang
    [Shijiazhuang News] More than a thousand women from all walks of life in Shijiazhuang City held a grand commemoration at the Shijiazhuang Cinema on March 8th. Comrade Gan Tang, Director of the Municipal Women's Federation, delivered an opening speech. After elaborating on the brief history of "March 8th," she explained that it is necessary to vigorously strengthen the work of female workers and further rely on female workers today. She also called on female workers in various public factories to actively produce, help each other and unite, strengthen learning, improve skills, improve quality, and increase quantity. Female staff should strengthen their professional study, improve their cultural and political level, strengthen their ties with the masses, and better serve the people. Mayor Ke pointed out in his speech: "Women must rise up to liberate themselves, but men also have a responsibility. The government must also strengthen women's work in the future and effectively guarantee women's democratic rights." Zhao Jinzi, a female worker from Da Xing Yarn Factory, and others described how they had suffered from feudal bondage, beatings, and scolding in the past, but today it has been reasonably resolved. Chen Huiying, a student who had just arrived from the KMT-controlled area, said: "Female workers and students in the KMT-controlled cities are unemployed and out of school, living a dark life, and even forced to sell their bodies, and are looking forward to the People's Liberation Army to rescue them as soon as possible." Finally, everyone responded to the call of the Municipal Women's Federation, determined to study hard, work hard, and actively support the front.
    [Another News] Women from various districts inside and outside Yangquan City held gatherings to solemnly commemorate their festival and passed a telegram of salute to Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu.
    Jinan
    [Jinan Electric] The female workers of the Third Factory of the Jinan Military Region Clothing Bureau celebrated "March 8th" Women's Day by actively producing and increasing production. In the tense production atmosphere, the factory educated the female workers about the relationship between the revolutionary war and the interests of women, and the obligations that women should fulfill in the war to carry the revolution through to the end. The female workers have taken a step forward in their thinking. For example, Li Fuyu, Guo Shuangting, etc., not only worked more carefully and patiently, but also encouraged others to work hard. They said to their fellow workers: "The soldiers at the front are bravely killing the enemy, so that our women can be liberated. If we don't do a good job, we will be sorry for them." Under their leadership, the work efficiency of all 96 female workers in the factory has been significantly improved.
    Health Department of the North China Government
    [Reported by this newspaper] The Health Department of the North China Government and the North China Health School held a forum on "March 8th" Women's Day, with 130 people attending. After Comrade Chen Jingru, the representative of the "March 8th" Preparatory Committee, reported on the brief history of "March 8th," everyone enthusiastically discussed what was hindering the progress of women cadres themselves in their work and study. Bai Guoyun said: "Some female comrades don't want to work after marriage and depend on their spouses. This is a 'housewife' mentality and they don't seek progress, which is wrong." Zhang Wenlan, a nurse in the outpatient department, reflected on her past unwillingness to do women's work, her willingness to do political and party affairs work, her willingness to study politics and culture, and her unwillingness to study health work, let alone obstetrics, fearing that people would call her "midwife." But today she realizes that any work is for the revolution. She said that she will definitely overcome these incorrect views in the future. In addition, other comrades also expressed their feelings in work and study. The meeting lasted for four hours and adjourned in an exciting and pleasant atmosphere.

　　团结妇女力量积极生产支前
    各地纷纷集会纪念“三八”
    张家口
    【张垣电】张家口市各界妇女在市妇联领导下，自上月二十七日至本月三日纷纷集会讨论以实际行动迎接张市解放后的第一个“三八”节。五天中市妇联召开了女工、工人家属、烈军工属、医院、市民等不同形式的二十六个座谈会和群众大会。机关妇女热烈地讨论了如何努力学习，做好工作，加强修养锻炼提高自己，从积极方面来克服别人对自己的轻视，并提出了很多改进工作的意见；女工、工人家属、市民则讨论了如何积极劳动，努力生产，提高自己的家庭与社会地位；军工家属们都准备写信给儿子或丈夫，劝他们勇敢杀敌，安心工作，早日消灭国民党反动派实现真正的和平。贸易公司在座谈后，全体妇女干部的学习和工作热情已有显著提高。
    石家庄
    【石家庄讯】石市各界妇女千余人，于三月八日，假石家庄电影院，举行隆重纪念。市妇联主任甘棠同志致开会词，她阐述“三八”简史后，说明今天必须大力加强女工工作，进一步依靠女工。并号召各公营工厂女工积极生产，互助团结，加强学习，提高技术，提高质量，增加数量。各女职员们要加强业务学习，提高文化、政治水平，加强与群众联系，更好的为人民服务。柯市长讲话中指出：“妇女必须自己起来解放自己，但男子也有责任。政府今后一定也要加强妇女工作，切实保障妇女民主权利。”大兴纱厂女工赵金子等陈述了自己以往遭受封建束缚，挨打受骂，但今天已得到合理解决。新从蒋管区来的学生陈惠英说：“蒋管区都市的女工、学生，失业失学，过着暗无天日的生活，甚至被迫出卖自己的肉体，正盼望着解放军早日去搭救她们。”最后大家都纷纷响应市妇联的号召，决努力学习、工作和积极支援前线。
    【又讯】阳泉市内外各区妇女分别集会，隆重纪念自己的节日，并通过向毛主席、朱总司令致敬电文。
    冀南
    【冀南电】冀南军区被服局第三厂女工，以积极生产、提高产量，来欢庆“三八”妇女节。在紧张地生产气氛中，该厂对女工进行了革命战争与妇女的利害关系、与妇女在将革命进行到底的战争中应尽的义务的教育。女工们在思想上提高了一步，如李富玉、郭双亭等，不但工作更加细心耐心，而且鼓励别人努力，她们对工友说：“前方战士英勇杀敌，使咱妇女得到解放，做不好活便对不起他们。”在她们带头下全厂九十六名女工的工作效率都有显著的提高。
    华北政府卫生部
    【本报讯】华北政府卫生部与华北卫生学校，在“三八”妇女节举行了座谈，到会的有一百三十人。“三八”筹委会代表陈静茹同志报告了“三八”简史后，大家就热烈地讨论起关于妇女干部本身在工作和学习中障碍自己进步的是什么的问题。白国云说：“有的女同志，结婚后就不想工作，依赖爱人，是一种‘太太’思想，不求进步，这是不对的。”门诊部护士张文兰反省了自己过去不愿作妇女工作，愿作政权、党务工作，愿学政治文化，不愿学卫生工作，更不愿学助产，怕人家叫“接生婆”。但今天她认识了：任何工作也都是为了革命。她表示今后一定克服这些不正确的观点。此外，其他同志均纷纷发表了自己在工作与学习中的感想，大会共进行了四个钟头，在兴奋愉快的气氛中散会。
