　　Democracy in Soviet Trade Unions
    In the life of Soviet trade unions, there exists a deeply rooted democratic foundation. All positions are filled through elections, and a secret ballot election system is carefully implemented. Trade union leaders must regularly report on their work to all members. At the same time, all members have the right to freely criticize leaders, and if the criticism is correct, leaders have no "right" to argue against it. This fundamental principle must be strictly observed not only by ordinary members of the trade union, but also by members of the trade union central committee, and even the All-Soviet Union Central Council of Trade Unions.
    Every year, trade union members in factories and institutions of all sizes gather to hear reports on the work of their leaders, and new leaders are elected at this meeting. Everyone would be amazed to see the strictness with which workers regard their trade union representatives. All members must have a "lively day" in which they can discuss and criticize the work of their leaders in public gatherings or individual committees.
    The Central Committee of the Canned Food Industry Trade Union recently investigated the election work in canned food factories from the second half of last year to the first half of this year. They learned that an average of 86.1 percent of members participated in the election meetings in 63 canned food enterprises.
    Nine factory committees were severely criticized for failing to meet the requirements of all members in managing trade union affairs. Some failed to properly resolve issues related to improving workers' housing and other material living conditions, others failed to properly organize socialist competitions (which, of course, affected workers' incomes), or failed to broadly use the state funds received for improving labor conditions in all aspects, and some failed to carry out mass cultural work effectively. Therefore, the work of these nine factory committees was judged unsatisfactory, and the committee members responsible for these shortcomings were not re-elected.
    The general results of the Canned Food Industry Trade Union elections are also of great interest. At the election meeting, the work of 54 of the 63 factory committees was considered perfect, and 35 percent of the members of these factory committees were replaced, but only 30 percent of the chairmen were re-elected. The reason for this re-election was not because the work of the local trade union leaders was poor, but mainly because a large number of new leaders grow up among the members every year. Everyone believes that this is a good opportunity for young members to develop. There are no "lifelong" positions in Soviet trade unions, and their leaders are also "replaced" frequently. This method is, of course, conducive to close ties between leaders and the masses.
    Nevertheless, this does not mean that trade union staff never violate their internal democracy. However, once there is a mistake, they will immediately be reprimanded by all members or higher trade union organizations.
    For example, the Kirov Provincial Committee of the Textile Workers' Union once recommended a representative from the chairmen of the factory committees to serve as a member of the provincial committee in order to "strengthen" the work of the committee. However, the Central Committee of the Textile Workers' Union canceled this resolution of the Kirov Provincial Committee because the committee member violated the trade union's democratic principle that all positions must be selected by secret ballot.
    The Central Committee of the Textile Workers' Union strictly enforces a rule that there must be a quorum of two-thirds of the total number of members at all member and committee meetings. The resolution of the meeting is invalid if it is not passed by an appropriate number of votes.
    Recently, the Central Committee of the Higher Education Staff Union found that only 20 of the 46 members attended the last plenary session of the Irkutsk Provincial Committee. Therefore, the Central Committee advocated reconvening the plenary session. A similar phenomenon also occurred this year in the Committee of the "North Ossetian" (in the Caucasus) Flour Milling Workers' Union.
    Soviet trade unions have developed and continue to develop a group of active members who, although they did not previously hold trade union positions, have spent some of their time and energy on trade union affairs. Their service is voluntary. There are now more than eight million of these "active members." Each factory committee benefits from no less than twenty or thirty of these active members to help them work, while larger factories have hundreds to help them. These active members are the living link between trade union leaders and all members. They undertake many tasks for the committee and help the committee with countless tasks, all of which are provided as unpaid services.
    Soviet workers all know that their trade unions support their own rights and interests. They all trust their own trade unions and can see or personally experience the benefits of trade union organizations every day. This is why energetic people among the workers are willing to be "active members."
    The prestige of Soviet trade unions in the eyes of workers is built on a democratic management style, which is reflected in strict adherence to election rules, free criticism and self-criticism, and regular and close contact between leaders and members.

### 苏联职工会的民主

　　苏联职工会的民主
    在苏联职工会生活里，存在着一种根深蒂固的民主基矗那里所有的职责都是选任的，并且慎重地施行着秘密投票选举制。职工会领导者得经常地对全体会员做工作报告。同时，全体会员也有自由批评领导者的权利，如果所批评的事情是正确的话，领导者就没有任何“权利”来抗辩的。应严格遵守这种基本原则的，不仅是职工会的普通会员，并且是职工会中央委员以至全苏联职工会中央委员会。
    每年，各大小工厂或各机关的职工会会员要集合在一起听他们领导者的工作做报告，同时在这大会上又要选出新任的领导者。如果大家看到那里工人对他们的职工会代表的严格情况一定会惊讶的。全体会员必有一个“热闹的日子”，在这日子中他们可在公共集会或个别委员会上讨论与批评他们的领导者的工作。
    罐头工业职工会中央委员会，近来在各地罐头制造工厂里调查了自去年下半期到今年上半期之间的选举工作。他们得知在六十三家的罐头企业选举大会上，平均竞有百分之八十六点一的会员参加了选举。
    有九家工厂委员会，因为它们在管理职工会业务上未能满足全体会员的要求，而受到了严格的责备。有的是因为它们在改善工人住宅与其他生活上的物质条件问题上，未能予以很好的解决，也因为它们没能适当地组织起社会主义竞赛（这种社会主义竞赛对工人收入上，当然要有影响的）或者因为它们未能把为改善劳动条件而领来的国家基金广泛地使用在各方面，也有的是因为它们未能很好地进行群众文化工作。因此，该九家工厂委员会的工作被审定为不能令人满意，所以对这些缺点应该负责任的委员，则都未能再被选上。
    罐头工业职工会的选举一般结果，也是一件极有兴趣的事情。在该选举大会上，六十三家工厂委员会中有五十四家工厂被认为它的工作是完善的，这些工厂委员会的委员，更换了百分之三十五，但在主席方面只有百分之三十受到了再选。这种改选的原因，并不是因为地方职工会各领导者的工作不佳，主要的是因为在会员中每年都要生长出一大批新的领导人才。大家认为这是给青年会员一个很好的发展机会。在苏联职工会中并没有“终生的”位置，它们领导者也是经常“更换”的。这种办法，当然是有利于领导者与群众之间的密切联系。
    虽然如此，但这并不是说职工会职员们就一点也不违犯他们的内部民主。然而一旦有了错误，马上就要受到全体会员或高级职工会团体的斥责。
    比如说，纺织工人联盟基洛夫省委员会一次为有必要“加强”委员会的工作，而由工厂委员会的主席里互推一名代表来做为省委员会的委员。但是，纺织工人联盟中央委员会却取消了该基洛夫省委员会的这一项决议，因为该委员违犯了一切职位都必须用秘密投票来选定的这种职工会的民主原则。
    纺织工人联盟中央委员会，很严格地执行着一个规则，即是在全体会员与委员会的大会上，总得有全体人数三分之二的出席人数。大会的决议如果没通过适当人数的表决则作为无效。
    最近，高等学校工作人员联盟中央委员会在伊尔库茨克省委员会的上次全体委员会议中，发现了四十六名委员中仅有二十名参加。因此，该中央委员会就主张了重新召开全体委员会议。类似这种的现象，今年在“北俄塞切昂”（在高加索）制粉工人联盟者委员会里面也发生过。
    苏联职工会曾发展了并且继续发展着一批以前虽不担任职工会工作但为职工会事务上花费了他们的一些时间与精力的积极会员。他们这种效劳都是自愿的。这种“积极会员”现在竞有了八百多万名。各工厂委员会得利不下二三十名的这些积极会员来帮助他们工作，而在较大的工厂则有数百名来帮助他们。这些积极会员乃是职工会领导者和全体会员之间的活的接合者。他们替委员会担负着许多的任务，又帮助委员会做着无数的工作，而这些任务与工作都是以无报酬效劳的。
    苏联的工人都知道他们的职工会是拥护他们自己的权利和利益的。他们都相信着他们自己的职工会，并且每天又可以看到或者亲身体验到职工会组织给他们的利益。这就是在工人之中有精力的人都愿意做个“积极会员”的原因。
    苏联职工会在工人眼中的威信是成长在民主管理方式之上，这种民主方式表现在严守选举规则、自由批评与自我批评以及领导者和会员之间有经常密切接触机会的生活上。
