【Chahar News】In order to restore and rebuild the industry of Zhangjiakou and Xuanhua, the North China People's Government decided to transport all the machines from the former Zhangjiakou General Machinery Factory, which were withdrawn by the Kuomintang bandit troops to Tianjin, back to Zhangjiakou. Through the efforts of all the employees of the factory, the machines have been completely moved, and they are now resuming their original positions to start work. The original plan for the transportation of all machines was to start loading them onto trains in Tianjin on the 1st of this month, complete the loading by the 22nd, and only then be able to transport them into the factory by the end of this month. However, due to the active loading and unloading by all employees, all the machines were transported into the factory by the 16th of this month, shortening the original plan by half. The original plan was to load the trains from 8:00 AM to 6:00 PM every day, but for two or three days, the train cars were delayed and did not arrive until 2:00 PM. Since the loading time could not be extended, the workers immediately mobilized and competed in each group, encouraging each other to carry out crash tasks and still complete the original plan on time. The employees who came to Zhangjiakou with the train immediately formed groups to carry out the transportation work. During this transportation work, many model workers emerged in the factory. The factory is now having each group submit a list, which will be discussed and reviewed by everyone, and awards or commendations will be given separately.

　　原张市总合机器厂机器
    由津运张
    【察哈尔讯】为恢复与重建张家口、宣化工业，华北人民政府决定将国民党匪军撤至天津之原张市总合机器厂全部机器运回张市后，经该厂全体员工的努力，已搬运完毕，现在各就原职展开工作。全部机器之搬运原计划订为本月一日开始在天津装车，二十二日装车完毕，至本月底始可能搬运进厂，但由于全体员工积极抢装、抢卸，截至本月十六日止，即全部搬运进厂，缩短了原计划二分之一的时间。装车原订每日上午八时至下午六时，但有两三天车皮误点，直至下午两点到站，装车时间又不能延长，工人们立刻在各组进行动员、竞赛，相互鼓励，突击任务，仍然按时完成了原订计划。随车来张的员工们，下车后立刻分组展开搬运工作。在此次搬运工作中，该厂涌现了不少工作模范，现该厂正由各组提出名单，经大家讨论评论后，将分别予以表扬或奖励。
