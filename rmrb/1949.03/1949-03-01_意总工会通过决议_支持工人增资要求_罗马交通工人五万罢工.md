Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 27th: Reports from various sources: The Italian General Confederation of Labor (CGIL) steering committee passed a resolution on the 22nd, authorizing each trade union to "adopt all methods to promote a general increase in wages" in order to support the wage increase demands of workers in various industries. After the Italian public transport workers' demand for wage increases was rejected by the government, they held a 24-hour protest general strike on the 21st. In Rome, 50,000 transportation workers and staff in the southern and suburban districts went on strike. Trams and buses disappeared from the streets of Rome. The government and right-wing trade unions carried out various activities to undermine the strike, but all failed. Municipal employees also went on strike in solidarity with striking employees of private enterprises. In order to cope with this strike by transportation workers across Italy, the Italian government had no choice but to transport passengers by truck in Rome, Milan, Florence and other places. In addition, in the city and province of Florence, printing workers were scheduled to strike from the 23rd.

  　支持工人增资要求
    罗马交通工人五万罢工
    【新华社陕北二十七日电】各方报导：意总工会指导委员会廿二日通过决议，援权各工会“采取一切方法促进普遍增加工资”，以支持各业工人的增资要求。全意公共交通工人在政府拒绝他们的增资要求以后，于二十一日举行了二十四小时的抗议总罢工。在罗马，南区和郊外区交通工人职员罢工者达五万人。罗马街头，电车和公共汽车均告绝迹。政府与右翼工会曾进行种种破坏罢工活动，但均告失败。市政雇员也举行罢工，以声援私营企业罢工雇员。意政府为应付全意交通工人的这一罢工，曾不能不在罗马、米兰和佛罗伦萨等地以卡车载运乘客。此外，在佛罗伦萨市和佛罗伦萨省，印刷工人已定于二十三日起罢工。
