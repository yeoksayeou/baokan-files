Xinhua News Agency, Beiping, 1st: At the Beiping Democratic Personages Congress on February 26th, a total of eighteen people from both the hosts and guests delivered speeches. In addition to the full texts of the speeches by Lin Biao, Li Jishen, Shen Junru, Ma Xulun, Guo Moruo, and Zhang Xiruo, which were published in the previous two days, the main points of the remaining twelve speeches are recorded below in order:

Comrade Peng Zhen:

Peng Zhen, Secretary of the Beiping Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, after exposing the fake peace conspiracy being played by the Kuomintang reactionary clique under the instigation of American imperialism, said: "All our people and all democratic parties and groups must unite as tightly as a steel plate, so that the enemy has no gaps to exploit and is given a resolute rebuff." He said: "What the people need is democratic peace, peace like that of Beiping. The so-called Beiping-style peace is peace that implements Chairman Mao's eight conditions. We must call on the people of the whole country to strive to achieve Beiping-style peace in other regions and cities." Regarding the issue of building a new democratic Beiping in the future, he believes that the political power of Beiping has been completely taken into the hands of the people. This has solved the fundamental problem of the revolution. However, this is only the completion of the first step. The task for the future is how to mobilize the masses, continue to eliminate reactionary remnants, and carry out various democratic constructions. He said that all Communist Party members in Beiping are extremely willing to listen attentively to and accept valuable opinions and criticisms of the work from all democratic personages. He hopes that everyone can say everything they know and say it without reservation in the future, and work together to build a new Beiping of people's democracy.

Tan Pingshan:

Tan Pingshan, the leader of the Kuomintang Three People's Principles Comrades Association, said: The old China will be overthrown, and a new China is being born. However, although the reactionary government has been split into pieces, it will still use various open and secret peace conspiracies to attack the democratic camp. The democratic forces must be more united and resolutely smash these conspiracies so that the revolution can be victorious throughout China as soon as possible.

Li Dequan:

Li Dequan of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang said: This gathering represents the unprecedented great unity of democratic forces throughout the country, and it represents that the democratic forces of all China are willing to work together under the leadership of Mao Zedong, the wise leader of the Chinese proletariat, the Communist Party of China, and the Chinese revolution, to thoroughly complete the revolution. She said: The Kuomintang reactionary regime is now attempting to buy time with fake peace to redeploy the war. At the same time, warlords in many places have put up the slogan of "protecting the territory and securing the people" to pretend to be different from the number one war criminal Chiang Kai-shek in order to preserve their strength, dominate one side, and continue to enslave the people. The people of the whole country must use their strength to shatter the illusions of these local warlords and strive for a Beiping-style peaceful resolution. She especially mentioned the women in the liberated areas she had contacted, saying that they participated in production, supported the front lines, supported Chairman Mao's eight peace conditions, and resolutely strived for peace. The National Women's Congress will be held in Beiping soon. I dare to predict that the sisters of the whole country will work harder to strive for true peace.

Zhang Bojun:

Zhang Bojun, Chairman of the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party, when mentioning the so-called "glorious peace" of the pseudo-Executive Yuan President Sun Ke, said: Sun Ke's so-called glorious peace should be changed to glorious surrender. Because surrendering to the workers, peasants, and the people of the whole country is glorious. As long as they accept Mr. Mao's proposals and the proposals of the various democratic parties, as long as they serve the people, we welcome them to come together, except for the war criminals.

Zhou Jianren:

Zhou Jianren, a director of the China Association for Promoting Democracy, believes that the enthusiastic support of all parties for Chairman Mao's eight peace conditions powerfully demonstrates that the proposals of the democratic parties and democratic personages who came to Beiping and the Communist Party of China are the same on the current situation. This also shows that the democratic camp can unite and carry the revolution through to the end. He said: The victory of the People's Liberation War and other series of successes prove the correctness of the leadership of the Communist Party of China and Chairman Mao Zedong. The people of the whole country should follow the path indicated by the CCP.

Zhu Xuefan:

Zhu Xuefan, one of the leaders of the Kuomintang Revolutionary Committee and Vice Chairman of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, said: The decades of struggle experience of the Chinese working class proves that only under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, by completely expelling imperialism and completely destroying the traitorous and dictatorial rule of the Kuomintang reactionaries, can we achieve true liberation. If one of Chairman Mao's eight proposals is not realized, it is not true peace, but fake peace. The working class is determined to fight with a spirit of self-sacrifice in this democratic revolutionary struggle, striving to produce and support the front lines in the liberated areas. We have decided to take the Shanghai and Nanjing locomotives that we manufactured across the Yangtze River.

Zhu Junxin:

Zhu Junxin, Executive Committee member of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, said: When the Kuomintang launched an all-out civil war after the end of the Anti-Japanese War, it completely ignored the peace demands of the people of the whole country. In June 1946, people's organizations in Shanghai petitioned the Nanjing government, demanding peace. As a result, the representatives were beaten, and Mr. Ma Xulun was one of those injured. Now they are putting up the signboard of "peace," but the people have already seen through it. Recently, three Shanghai transportation workers were massacred, once again proving that the reactionaries' peace is fake. Democratic personages across the country should unite and carry the revolution through to the end, and avenge the dead.

Zhang Naiqi:

Zhang Naiqi, a director of the Democratic National Construction Association, said that in his more than 30 years in the business community, he had not solved two problems: The first problem is how, as an industrialist and businessman, can he obtain profits while also making his work beneficial to the people and the country; the second problem is how labor and capital can cooperate under these conditions. These two problems cannot be solved under the rule of imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism. He said: Only in the liberated areas is it possible to achieve "both public and private interests, and benefits for both labor and capital."

Xu Deheng:

Xu Deheng, a professor at Peking University, said: I hope that Yan Huiqing, Shao Lizi, Zhang Shizhao, Jiang Yong and other four people who attended this meeting will honestly bring the real situation after the liberation of Beiping back to the South, so that the South will know how free the workers, peasants, soldiers, students, and merchants are after the liberation of Beiping. The Chinese people do not want anything but peace, but what they want is peace without imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism. This is Chairman Mao's eight peace conditions. The four gentlemen should honestly bring this situation back, which is truly coming for peace.

Xiao Caiyu:

Xiao Caiyu, a professor at Nankai University, said: After the liberation of Tianjin and Beiping, we can say what we want to say and do what we want to do, which is impossible under the rule of the Kuomintang. He believes that the resolution of the Beiping issue is a good way to achieve true peace.

Comrade Dong Biwu:

Dong Biwu, Chairman of the North China People's Government, said: The Communist Party of China and the People's Liberation Army have received the support of democratic personages from all parties in carrying out the liberation war, and have now achieved a decisive victory. Today, you all unanimously and firmly advocate the realization of Chairman Mao's eight peace conditions, demand the thorough destruction of the Kuomintang reactionary regime, and strive for true peace. This is our common political goal today, and it is also the political foundation for our close unity. At present, in addition to the revolutionary war, we are also faced with the extremely arduous task of building a new democratic country. We should unite even more, we should formulate political programs and policies that are beneficial to the people of the whole country, and on the basis of these programs and policies, strive for the complete victory of the Chinese people's democratic revolution.

　　北平欢迎民主人士大会一致表示
    人民需要北平式的和平
    要求彻底摧毁国民党反动政权
    【新华社北平一日电】在二月二十六日北平欢迎民主人士大会上，主客双方共有十八个人发表演说。除林彪、李济深、沈钧儒、马叙伦、郭沫若、张奚若等六人的演说全文已于前昨两日发表外，兹将其余十二人的演说要点依次分志如下：
    彭真同志：
    中国共产党北平市委员会书记彭真，在揭露国民党反动集团在美帝国主义主使下正玩弄的假和平阴谋之后，说道：“我们全体人民，所有民主党派团体必须紧密地团结得象一块钢板一样，使敌人无孔可钻，并给以坚决的回击。”他说：“人民所需的是民主的和平，象北平这样的和平。所谓北平式的和平，就是执行毛主席的八项条件的和平。我们要号召全国人民，在其他各个地区，各个城市，争取实现北平式的和平。”对于今后建设新民主的北平问题，他认为北平的政权已完全拿到人民手中了，这解决了革命的根本问题，就这还只是完成第一步工作，今后的任务是如何发动群众，继续扫除反动残余和进行各项民主建设。他说，在北平的全体共产党员极愿意用心地听取和接受各方民主人士对工作的宝贵意见和批评，希望今后大家彼此都能知无不言，言无不尽，共同努力来建设人民民主的新北平。
    谭平山：
    国民党三民主义同志会的领导者谭平山说：旧中国就将被推倒，新中国正在诞生。但是反动政府虽已四分五裂，还会用种种公开的和秘密的和平阴谋等花样，向民主阵营进攻。民主力量要更加团结，坚决粉碎这些阴谋，使革命快点在全中国胜利。
    李德全：
    中国国民党革命委员会李德全说：这次集会表示着全国民主力量空前的大团结，表示着全中国的民主力量愿意在中国无产阶级、中国共产党、中国革命的英明领袖毛泽东先生的领导之下，齐心协力来彻底完成革命。她说：国民党反动政权现在企图用假和平来争取时间，重新部署战争，同时，许多地方的军阀则打出了保境安民的口号，假装与第一号战犯蒋介石不同，以图保存力量，独霸一方，继续奴役人民。全国人民要拿出力量来，打破这些地方军阀的幻想，争取北平式的和平解决。她特别提到她所接触到的解放区的妇女时说，她们参加生产，支援前线，拥护毛主席的八项和平条件，坚决为着和平而努力奋斗。全国妇女代表大会不久将在北平召开，我敢预言，全国的姐妹们必将更加努力地来争取真正的和平。
    章伯钧：
    中国农工民主党主席章伯钧，在提到伪行政院长孙科的所谓“光荣的和平”时说：孙科所谓光荣的和平，应该改为光荣的投降。因为向工农及全国人民投降是光荣的。只要接受毛先生的主张和各民主党派的主张，只要为人民服务，除开战犯，我们都欢迎他们一齐来。
    周建人：
    中国民主促进会理事周建人认为各方对毛主席的八项和平条件的热烈拥护，有力地说明了此次来平的各民主党派与民主人士和中国共产党对目前时局的主张是相同的。这也就说明民主阵营能团结一致，将革命进行到底。他说：人民解放战争的胜利以及其他一连串的成功，证明中国共产党与毛泽东主席领导的正确，全国人民应当跟着中共所指示的道路走。
    朱学范：
    国民党革命委员会的领导人之一中华全国总工会副主席朱学范说：中国工人阶级数十年来的斗争经验证明；只有在中国共产党领导之下，彻底驱逐了帝国主义；彻底摧毁卖国独裁的国民党反动统治，才能得到真正的解放。毛主席提出的八项主张，一条不实现，就不是真正的和平，便是假和平。工人阶级在这次民主革命斗争中，抱定了自我牺牲的奋斗精神，在解放区里努力生产，支援前线。我们已决定要拿自己制造出来的上海号、南京号火车头开过长江去。
    朱俊欣：
    中华全国总工会执委朱俊欣说：国民党在抗战结束后发动全面内战时，全不理会全国人民的和平要求，一九四六年六月上海人民团体曾向南京政府请愿，要求和平，结果代表被殴打，马叙伦先生就是被打伤的一个。现在他们挂起“和平”的招牌了，但早已被人民识破了。最近上海交通工人三人被屠杀，又一次证明了反动派的和平是假的，全国民主人士应团结起来，将革命进行到底，为死者复仇。
    章乃器：
    民主建国会理事章乃器说，他在工商界三十多年来没有解决的两个问题：第一个问题是作为一个工商业家，怎样可以一面得到利润，一面又使自己的工作还能够对人民与国家有些好处；第二个问题是劳资怎样在这种条件之下合作。这两个问题在帝国主义、封建主义、官僚资本主义的统治之下不可能解决。他说：只有在解放区，才有可能做到“公私兼顾，劳得两利”。
    许德珩：
    北京大学教授许德珩说：我希望参加这次会的颜惠庆、邵力子、章士钊、江庸等四位回去以后，老老实实地把北平解放后的真实情形带到南方去，让南方知道北平解放后的工农兵学商是怎样的自由。中国人民没有不希望和平的，但要的是没有帝国主义、封建主义、官僚资本主义的和平，这就是毛先生提出的八项和平条件，四位先生应该老老实实把这个情形带回去，才是真正为和平而来。
    萧采瑜：
    南开大学教授萧采瑜说：平津解放后，能说所要说的话，能做所要做的事，这在国民党统治下是不可能的。他认为北平问题的解决是达到真和平的好方式。
    董必武同志：
    华北人民政府主席董必武说：中国共产党和人民解放军在进行解放战争中，曾得到各方民主人士的支持，现在已取得了决定性的胜利。今天，诸位又一致坚决地主张实现毛主席的八项和平条件，要求彻底摧毁国民党反动政权，争取真正的和平，这是我们今天共同奋斗的政治目标，也是我们能亲密团结的政治基础。目前除了革命战争以外，我们还面临着建设新民主主义国家的极繁重的任务。我们更应团结起来，我们应当制定有利于全国人民的政治纲领和政策，在这种纲领和政策的基础上，为中国人民民主革命的彻底胜利而奋斗。
