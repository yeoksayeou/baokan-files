　　Central Plains Trade Corporation Holds Meeting
　　Summarize Work and Determine Policy
　　【Xinhua News Agency, Central Plains, 5th】The business meeting of the Central Plains Trade Corporation, convened with its subordinate units, concluded the other day. Attending the meeting were the managers of fourteen units, including the Yuxi and Yu-Wan-Su branch companies, the Kaifeng, Zhengzhou, Luoyang, Xuchang, Luohe, and Nanyang city companies, the Yuxian, Xiangxian, Lushan, and Wuyang county state-owned stores, as well as the Yu-Tai Import and Export Trading Company and the Taifeng Tobacco Company. At this meeting, experiences were exchanged, work was summarized, and the trade policy of "consolidating currency value, stabilizing prices, developing production, and ensuring war supply" was determined.
　　The Central Plains Trade Corporation was established in December of last year. Prior to this, the trade organization systems in various parts of the Central Plains were complex and fragmented, their strength was dispersed, and their steps were very inconsistent, failing to play their due role in regulating materials, controlling the market, and fighting the enemy's economic warfare. Since its establishment more than two months ago, the company has achieved remarkable results. In terms of supporting the war, it completed the procurement tasks of 500,000 pairs of military shoes, 600,000 bars of soap, 400,000 towels, and 2,000,000 square feet of native cloth and oilcloth. At the same time, it enabled the extensive household sideline production and handicraft production in the cities of Zhengzhou, Kaifeng, Luoyang, and Lushan to achieve a certain degree of development. In terms of foreign trade, it purchased 8,000,000 jin of tea, 2,000,000 jin of cotton, and peanuts, and organized exports, obtaining favorable exchanges in foreign trade, and appropriately solving the production and livelihood problems of tea and tobacco. In order to promote the sales of tung oil, oak shells, silk, and other mountain products from the Baofeng, Jiaxian, Linru, Nanzhao, and Yi-Lu-Song areas of western Henan, and to supply the local people with grain and other daily necessities, the company established the Yufeng Store in the Lushan area, handling mountain goods and grain, and regulating the market. In terms of leading the market, the Zhengzhou, Luoyang, Kaifeng, and Xuchang trading companies respectively established retail departments, and systematically supplied grain, oil, salt, coal, and other daily necessities to the employees of various agencies and state-owned enterprises, so that prices could be kept relatively stable.

　　中原贸易总公司召开会议
  　总结工作确定方针
    【新华社中原五日电】中原贸易总公司召集所属各单位举行之业务会议，已于日前结束。出席会议者有豫西、豫皖苏两个分公司，开封、郑州、洛阳、许昌、漯河、南阳六个市公司，禹县、襄县、鲁山、舞阳四个县公营商店，及豫泰进出口贸易公司，泰丰烟草公司等十四个单位的经理人员。在这个会议上，交流了情况，总结了工作，确定了“巩固币值，稳定物价，发展生产，保证战争供给”的贸易方针。
    中原贸易总公司系于去年十二月成立。在此以前，中原各地原有之贸易机构系统庞杂，力量分散，步调很不一致，对调剂物资、掌握市场以及对敌经济斗争，未能起应有的作用。该公司成立两月多以来，已获得显著成绩。在支援战争方面：完成了五十万双军鞋，六十万条肥皂，四十万条毛巾，二百万方尺土布及油布等的收购任务，同时使郑州、开封、洛阳、鲁山各城市的广大家庭副业生产、手工业生产，有了一定的发展。在对外贸易方面：收购了八百万斤茶叶、二百万斤棉花及花生米等，并组织出口，获得对外贸易的有利交换，适当解决了茶叶、烟的生产和生活问题。为推销豫西的宝丰、郏县、临汝、南召、伊鲁嵩一带的桐油、橡壳、蚕丝等山货，及供应当地人民的粮食等生活必需品，该公司在鲁山境设立豫丰商店，吞吐山货粮食，调剂市场。在领导市场方面：郑、洛、汴、许市贸易公司、分别设立门市部、有计划的供应了各机关、公营企业员工们的粮、油、盐、煤等生活必需品，使物价得以保持相对稳定。
