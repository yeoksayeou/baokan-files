Xinhua News Agency, Beiping, March 28th, TASS Moscow, March 27th: An Izvestia observer commented on the order issued by the Western Three Powers Command in Berlin to discontinue the German Mark in the Western districts, stating: The damage caused to the working people in West Berlin by this event can be seen from the following facts: many people living in the Western districts work in the Eastern districts, and some people living in the Eastern districts work in the Western districts, while the municipal affairs of the city are managed by the occupying power of the area where they are located. The Western authorities' order discriminates against residents living in the Western districts who work and receive rations in the Eastern districts. Residents of the Western districts have also been deprived of some money, as only fifteen German Marks from each deposit can be exchanged, and no revaluation will be made for current accounts and deposits. The observer said: This monetary conspiracy cannot undermine the currency circulation in the Soviet zone. Its significance lies mainly in further dividing the German capital and creating artificial contradictions among the people in various districts of Berlin, in order to divert the dissatisfaction of the residents of the Western districts with the Western occupying authorities and the puppet municipal government. This is closely related to their policy of splitting Germany, which is deeply hostile to the cause of peace and the interests of all countries, including Germany.

    柏林西区停用德国马克造成对劳动人民的损害
    【新华社北平二十八日电】塔斯社莫斯科二十七日讯：消息报观察家评柏林西方三国司令部所发西区停用德国马克称：这件事对于柏林西区劳动人民所引起的损害，可从下述事实看出来，即很多住在西区的人在东区工作，同时又有些住在东区的人在西区工作，而该市市政事业则各由所在地占领国营制。西方当局的命令，使住在西区而在东区工作和获取配给的居民遭到歧视待遇。西区居民并被剥夺了一些钱，因为每笔存款中将仅有十五个德国马克可以兑换，且对现在的帐目和存款不作任何重新估价。观察家说：这种货币阴谋丝毫不能破坏苏联占区的货币流通。其意义主要在于进一步分裂德国首都，在柏林各地区人民之间造成人为的矛盾，以便转移西区居民对西方占领当局及傀儡市政府的不满。这与他们对德国问题的分裂政策是密切关联者的，而这个政策是深深敌视和平事业和包括德国在内的一切国家的利益的。
