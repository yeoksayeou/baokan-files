　　"Poor People in Charge" is a Wrong Practice
    Taihang Branch Criticizes the Work of Xiuwu Chengguan District as Being Biased
    [Taihang Electric] In the newly recovered Chengguan District of Xiuwu, northern Henan, during the movement to thoroughly mobilize the masses to suppress bandits and closely integrate with organizing production for self-salvation in December of last year and January of this year, a saying and practice of "poor people in charge" emerged. According to the county party committee office's report on the work summary of the district in December, although it was pointed out that some areas had a bias of "drilling into the circle of the poor, lacking comprehensive mobilization of the masses," which led to "setbacks in the development of the movement," the practice of "poor people in charge" continued to develop in the district since January. In late January, poor people's associations were established in Dongguan and four other administrative villages. According to the Dongguan Poor People's Association's investigation, it included poor people, merchants, handicraft workers, and independent laborers, and workers were also absorbed and led by the poor people (What classes do the poor people include? How can they lead everything? - Editor). In early February, the Fourth District Committee and the County Party Committee Office successively reported on the achievements and experiences of Dongguan in suppressing remnants, but did not criticize this, but praised it, saying: "The poor people's association organizes militia and transforms the village government, playing a leading role in the village." The county's work summary for January also stated: "The poor people's association has the power and responsibility to lead production and thoroughly suppress bandits." In addition, the County Party Committee Office, in its notification of the general completion of bandit suppression in Chengguan District, also praised the role of poor people's activists and proposed the mobilization slogan of: "Unity is strength, the poor people rule the world," and emphasized "Enhancing the confidence of the poor in being in charge." The county party committee consciously used the poor people's association of Dongguan as a model for the whole county. In the summary of grain borrowing work in Da Han of the Seventh District, it was also proposed that "With the poor people in charge, everyone can handle everyone's affairs, which is really enjoyable." The branch believes that this erroneous slogan of "the poor people ruling the world" and the work line of "poor people in charge" is a principle error and violates the party's general policy and general line. The above-mentioned bias is a disguised appearance of the "poor and hired peasant line" in the previous rural land reform. If it is not quickly and strictly checked and resolutely and timely corrected, its development will inevitably cause serious errors in the work.

　　“贫民当家”是错误的作法
    太行分社批评修武城关区工作偏向
    【太行电】豫北新收复之修武城关区，在去年十二月与今年一月深入发动群众肃匪并紧密结合组织生产自救的运动中，出现了一种“贫民当家”的说法和作法，据县委办公室在报导该区十二月份工作总结中，虽曾指出部分地区有“钻向贫民圈，欠缺全面发动群众”的偏向，致使“运动发展受到挫折”，但在一月份以来，“贫民当家”的作法在该区仍继续发展。一月下旬，东关等五个行政村先后成立贫民会，据东关贫民会调查，其中包括贫民，商贩、手工业者、独立劳动者，而工人亦被吸收，受贫民领导（贫民包括些什么阶层？何以能领导一切？——编者）。据四地委与县委办公室二月上旬先后通报东关肃残成绩与经验中对此亦未加批评反予表扬称：“贫民会组织民兵，改造村政权在村中起着领导作用”。该县一月份工作总结中亦称：“贫民会有职有权，领导生产彻底肃匪”另外，县委办公室在通报城关区肃匪大体完成中，还表扬了贫民积极分子串通作用，提出：“团结力量大，贫民坐天下”的动员口号，并强调指出“贫民当家，敌伪低头”，以及“提高贫民的当家信心”等。县委并有意识的以东关的贫民会作为全县示范。在七区大韩总结公粮借征工作中，亦提出“贫民当家，大家事大家办真痛快”。分社认为：这种错误的“贫民坐天下”的口号与“贫民当家”的工作路线是原则上的错误，与党的总政策总路线相违背的。上述偏向是以往农村土地改革中“贫雇路线”的变相出现。如不迅速严格检查，并坚决及时纠正，发展下去，将必造成工作中的严重错误。
