　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 4th – According to a report from Diantong News Agency, London, February 27th: While the British Communist Party held an expanded executive committee meeting to discuss the struggle to defend world peace, the British Labour Party Executive Committee convened an enlarged meeting at the Isle of Wight, near Portsmouth in southern England. Certain cabinet ministers and high-ranking officials attended the meeting. The meeting place was heavily guarded. On the table of the Labour Party Executive Committee was a draft political program as secret as the meeting itself, unknown to the broad masses of the Labour Party and the British working people. The basis of this draft is to strengthen the anti-Soviet "Cold War," increase the amount of military spending, and intensify the exploitation of British colonies and the British working people in the movement demanding more weapons, more soldiers, and more war maniacs.

　　英工党召开执委会  秘密讨论增加军备
    【新华社陕北四日电】据电通社伦敦二月二十七日讯：当英国共产党举行扩大执委会讨论为保卫世界和平而斗争的时候，英国工党执行委员会在英国南部朴资茅斯附近的威地岛召开了扩大会议，某些内阁部长和高级官僚出席了这一会议。会场周围警卫森严。摆在工党执委会桌上的，是一个正如会议本身一样秘密的、为工党广大群众和英国劳动人民所不知道的政纲草案。这一草案的基础，是加强反苏“冷战”，增加军备经费的数目，在要求更多武器、更多兵员和更多战争狂的运动中，加强对英国殖民地和英国劳动人民的剥削。
