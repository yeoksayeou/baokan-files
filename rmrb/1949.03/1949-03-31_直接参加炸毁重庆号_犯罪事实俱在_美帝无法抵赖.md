Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, March 29th: The American imperialists who directly participated in bombing the Chongqing cruiser have remained silent since this agency published the truth about the Chongqing incident. Only the Associated Press, the mouthpiece of American imperialism, mentioned in a Shanghai dispatch on the 26th an ambiguous statement by a certain irresponsible U.S. Navy personnel stationed in Shanghai: "There have been no American submarines in Chinese waters since last month." But the falsity of this statement cannot be compensated for even by the Associated Press. In the same report, the agency stated: "Despite the Navy's denial, some observers still point out that it would be unusual if the U.S. Navy did not monitor such a powerful ship." It is worth noting that in the aforementioned dispatch, the U.S. Navy in Shanghai did not deny that the "B29" bomber with U.S. insignia bombed the Chongqing, which means that they have already acquiesced to the main part of the crime committed by the American imperialists in this incident. But in fact, the other part of their criminal behavior is absolutely undeniable. Everyone knows that the weak navy of the Kuomintang reactionaries did not possess any submarines, and even the U.S. Navy cannot say that the submarines that appeared on the sea off Huludao belonged to the Kuomintang. The Associated Press's observer claimed: "The submarine might be Soviet?" This is truly a case of "trying to cover up something when it is already exposed," as the ancient Chinese saying goes. Any quibbling by the American aggressors is futile. The Chinese people will firmly remember the Chongqing incident, which demonstrates that the American aggressors directly participated in the counter-revolutionary civil war of the Kuomintang reactionaries, bombed the Chinese people's naval vessels, destroyed the Chinese people's coastal defense forces, and invaded China's territorial airspace and waters. Although the American aggressors bombed a Chongqing cruiser, they cannot prevent the Chinese people from building their own navy, just as they exhausted all their efforts to help the Kuomintang reactionaries but could not stop the Chinese people from winning today's victory.

### 直接参加炸毁重庆号　犯罪事实俱在　美帝无法抵赖

　　直接参加炸毁重庆号
    犯罪事实俱在
    美帝无法抵赖
    【新华社北平二十九日电】直接参加炸毁重庆号巡洋舰的美帝国主义者，在本社公布重庆号事件真相后，默不作声。只有美国帝国主义的通讯社美联社二十六日上海电，提到某一不负责任的美国驻上海海军人员的暧昧的谈话：“自上月以来中国海面上即无美国潜艇。”但是这句话的虚伪性连美联社也无法代为弥补。该社在同一报道中说：“尽管海军否认，若干观察家仍指出，如果美国海军不注视如此强大的船舰，那才是不平常的”。值得注意的是：在上述电讯中，上海美国海军方面并不否认美国国徽的“Ｂ２９”式轰炸机轰炸重庆号，这就是说已经默认了美帝国主义者在这次事件中所犯罪恶的主要部分。但实际上，他们的犯罪行为的另一部分，也是绝对不容抵赖的。谁都知道，国民党反动政府的薄弱的海军并未拥有任何潜水艇，就连美国海军方面也不能说葫芦岛海面上出现的潜水艇是属于国民党的。美联社的观察家宣称：“潜艇可能是苏联的？”这真正是中国古话所说的欲盖弥彰。美国侵略者的任何狡辩是徒劳无功的。中国人民将牢牢地记住重庆号事件，说明美国侵略者直接参加国民党反动派的反革命内战，炸毁中国人民的海军舰船，破坏中国人民的海防力量，侵犯中国领空领海的罪恶事件。美国侵略者虽然炸毁了一艘重庆号巡洋舰，却不能防止中国人民建设自己的海军，正象他们竭尽一切力量帮助国民党反动派，却无法阻止中国人民赢得今日的胜利一样。
