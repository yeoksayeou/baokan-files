[Jizhong News] In Fanliang Village, Dacheng County, the agricultural production mutual aid group organized by three women, Liu Fengming, Hao Mingyue, and Chen Yuzhen, all military dependents, has persisted for a full five years. All three families are dependents of military cadres, with only one or two people in each household, cultivating a total of 41 mu of land and jointly raising a donkey. Although all three families lack labor, since they organized, they have rarely needed help from the village. Except for planting, which requires asking for help, they do everything themselves. The three families are very united. During the busy farming season, they not only work together but also cook and eat together. Hao Mingyue's mother is in charge of taking care of the children and cooking at home, while the three of them go to the fields to work. Because they work hard, they do everything in an orderly manner and don't lag behind. During the autumn harvest and wheat planting, they planted 16 mu of wheat early. The barren land was also quickly cultivated in the autumn. After the big autumn harvest last year, they organized three more military dependents women and one man to open a small restaurant, selling dumplings on market days. In three months, each person earned more than two dou of wheat and 120,000 border currency. On the sixth day of the first lunar month this year, Liu Fengming and the other two families made this year's production plan and have already started collecting and transporting manure.

　　樊良村三个军属妇女
  　互助生产不用村里代耕
    【冀中讯】大城樊良村，妇女刘凤鸣、郝明月、陈玉珍三个人组织的农业生产互助组，已经坚持整整五年。她们三家都是军干家属，各家都是一两口人，共种地四十一亩，伙养着一头驴。虽然三家都缺乏劳动力，但是自组织起来以后，很少用过村里帮助。除去耩地求人，一切活都是自己干。她们三家很团结，到农忙时，不但伙着做活，连饭都是伙着做伙着吃。郝明月她娘专管在家里抱孩子做饭，她们三人便下地做活，由于她们很努力，样样活做的很有次序，那样也不落后。秋收种麦时，早早伙耩了十六亩麦子，白地、也很快的秋耕过来。去年大秋完了以后，她们又组织了三个军属妇女和一个男的，开了一个小饭铺，逢集日便煮饺子卖。三个月每人赚了二斗多麦子，还有边币十二万元。今年阴历正月初六日，刘凤鸣她们三家，又作出了今年的生产计划，并已开始捣粪送粪。
