　　At the Party Public Congress
　　—A Typesetter's Diary
　　Northern Printing Bureau Jia Liye
　　At sixteen o'clock last December, while working intensely, someone whispered, "There's a meeting after dinner tonight." At first, I thought in my heart that it was just an "ordinary" meeting! I didn't feel anything special. But after hearing Wang Shibao and Wang Guanyi's private words, knowing what kind of meeting it was, my heart was in turmoil, both excited and happy, not knowing what to do.
　　After dinner, the sun went down. The assembly bell rang "dong, dong," and everyone gathered in a pre-arranged room. I walked back and forth, looking at the slogans on the wall. In the center of the rostrum were two bright red Party flags, under the flags were huge portraits of revolutionary leaders, and below was the oath for new Party members. On the large flag were the words "Branch Public Opening and New Party Member Swearing-in Meeting," and on the right was the list of Party members.
　　When everyone arrived, it was announced that the meeting was starting, and the room immediately quieted down. After the chairman reported the significance of the meeting, the fourth item was the speech by the new Party members: Comrade Xiao Wenhai happily walked onto the rostrum, with more than a hundred pairs of eyes fixed on him. He said, "In the past two or three years, I couldn't find the door to the Party, and I just worked with my head down. My political understanding was very poor. I received a great education in the Party rectification study, and at the same time, I gloriously joined the Communist Party. In the future, I will definitely work harder and completely overcome my shortcomings." Old Section Chief Niu Liansheng said, "I have lived for fifty-three years and have two mothers. The first is the mother who gave birth to me, who has passed away. The second is the Communist Party, she is my lovely mother. Today I have thrown myself into her arms, and I must work harder to serve the Party to the end and liberate all of China."
　　At this time, my heart was filled with envy and shame. I thought to myself, "How glorious it is to join the Party! Why can't I be approved to join the Party? Maybe it's because I have many shortcomings and I'm not very active in my work!" I asked myself, and a trembling heart jumped "thump, thump," and my face immediately started to burn. A burst of warm applause broke my reverie. It turned out that the meeting had proceeded to the free speech item. Comrade Wang Guanyi said, "In the past, I thought that Comrade Xiao Wenhai was just a dead honest person who worked with his head down and didn't like to talk, so I looked down on him. Today I know that this view was wrong. He joined the Party, but I fell behind him. In the future, I will learn more from him, work honestly, work hard, be loyal to the Party, and hope that the Party will investigate my history and absorb me into the Party."
　　Based on my experience in daily life and the performance in this meeting, there are really many comrades who have the same desire to join the Party as I do.
　　This conference gave me a great education that I will never forget! I am determined to work hard and continue to apply to join the Communist Party!

　　在党公开大会上
    ——一个排字工人的日记
    北方印刷局  贾立业
    十二月去年十六日下午，正在紧张工作的时候，有人低声说：“今天晚饭后开会。”我起初心里认为还不过是“平常”的一个会吧！并不感觉怎样。但在王士保和汪贯一二人的私语中，知道是怎样一个会议后，心里就纷乱不定了，又是激动，又是高兴，不知怎样才好。
    吃过晚饭，太阳落下山去。集合钟“当当”的响了，大家聚在一个预先布置好的屋子内，我转来转去，看着墙上的标语，正中主席台上有两面鲜红的党旗，旗下有革命领袖的巨像，再下面是新党员入党誓词，大旗上有“支部公开暨新党员入党宣誓大会”的字样，右边是党员的名单。
    人到齐了，宣布开会，屋子立刻安静了。主席报告开会意义后，第四项是新党员讲话：肖文海同志高兴的走上主席台，有百余对眼睛注视着他，他说：“过去的两三年中，我找不到党的大门，只是低着头工作，政治认识很差，在整党学习中，得到了很大教育，同时又光荣地参加了共产党，今后一定更加努力工作，把自己的缺点完全克服掉。”老股长钮连生说：“我活了五十三岁，有两个母亲，第一个是生我的母亲，她已去世。第二个就是共产党，她是我的一个可爱的母亲，今天我投入了她的怀抱，一定要更加努力，为党服务到底，解放全中国。”
    这时，我的心眼里非党羡慕、又很惭愧当时想到：“人家入了党，是多么光荣呀！自己为何就不能被批准入党？可能是缺点很多，工作又不大积极的原因吧！”自己问着自己，一颗颤抖的心“咚咚”的跳，立刻脸就发烧起来了。一阵热烈的掌声，打破了我的胡思乱想，原来会议进行到自由讲话一项了，汪贯一同志说：“我过去认为肖文海同志低着头干活，不爱说话是死老实，就看不起他，今天知道这个看法错了。他入了党，我却落在他后面了，往后要多向他学习，老老实实的工作。埋头苦干，对党忠实，并希望党根据我的历史考查我，吸收我入党。”
    根据日常生活上的体验，和这次会议中的表现来看；与我同样有入党要求的同志，实在多得很。
    这次大会给了我很大的教育，将使我永远不会忘掉！我决心努力，继续要求加入共产党！
