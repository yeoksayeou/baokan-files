　　Qinghe Woolen Mill Trade Union
  　Bids Farewell to Comrades Going South
    [Report from our newspaper] Workers Na Qixian and Zhu Wenyue from Qinghe Woolen Mill joined the Southward Work Group. Because they were leaving the factory for training, the Trade Union Preparatory Committee held a grand farewell meeting on the afternoon of the 12th, and presented each of them with a diary and a pen. Na Qixian originally planned to get married in April this year, but this time he resolutely decided to go south. At the farewell meeting, he declared: "I will not return until the reactionaries are defeated." Their enthusiasm moved all the staff and workers of the factory. At the meeting, many staff and workers eagerly spoke, everyone resolved to increase production and support the front line, and to learn from Na Qixian and Zhu Wenyue. (Huang Cheng)
