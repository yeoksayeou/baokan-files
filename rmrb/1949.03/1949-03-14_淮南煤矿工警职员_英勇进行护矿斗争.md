Xinhua News Agency, East China, 7th. The more than 10,000 workers, mine police, and soldiers of the famous Huainan Coal Mine in Jianghuai, before liberation, organized a heroic struggle to protect the mine, shattered the Kuomintang bandit gang's attempt to destroy and dismantle machinery and materials, and completely preserved the mine and all its assets. This heroic action to protect national wealth is worthy of emulation by mine workers in other areas that are about to be liberated. The mine is located north of the Huai River and south of the Huaiyang Mountains, covering an area of 470,000 mu. It is of great importance to industry and transportation in the Jianghuai area. Its mining history spans 20 years, and its output has been increasing daily, from an initial daily output of 10 tons to 2,000 tons. Since the full opening of the Huainan Railway, the Huainan Mining Bureau, which operates the mine, and the Datong Coal Mine Company in the same mining area have been merged into the Huainan Railway Corporation. The mine is well-equipped and has great potential for development, with an estimated maximum daily output of 10,000 tons. Because of its special status in the Jianghuai area, the Kuomintang attempted to destroy it before liberation. Since the liberation of Xuzhou, the Shanghai head office of the mine has specially prepared special trains to dismantle and transport all the mine's equipment to the south. The workers of the mine's machine shop immediately went on strike in protest, and blocked the railway with rails to prevent the train from leaving. Wang Kezhen, a worker in the west mine of the Jiulonggang mine, telephoned Liu Youxiang and Yuan Xiaoyun in the east mine. The two sides united and, under the slogan of "Don't break our rice bowls," called on 3,000 to 4,000 workers to strike at the same time, and more than 800 workers rushed to the station to guard the train. The workers surrounded the mine office, demanding three months' salary and six months' food, and cooperated with the staff to form a mine protection team, patrolling the mine, guarding equipment, preventing dismantling, and inspecting vehicles. The staff and workers were well-organized and closely linked, supporting each other in the struggle. Once destruction or dismantling was discovered, they jointly rose up to stop it. Because of the unity of the staff and workers in launching a struggle against the Kuomintang bandit gang and the head office, all their conspiracies were foiled. On November 24 last year, the factory sent another evacuation train. More than 3,000 workers from the Jiulong Mine immediately turned out to stop the train and sent people to guard the material warehouse. The Kuomintang bandit army sent a company to suppress them, firing more than ten shots and throwing four grenades, wounding worker Wan Jiafu. The workers fought back with stones, wounding one bandit soldier. The bandit army was forced to dare not interfere any further. With the support of the workers' strength and the influence of the Communist Party's policies and the victorious situation of the Liberation War, the mine's staff members protected the mine together with the workers, preserved archives and registers, and prepared to welcome the People's Liberation Army. On January 15, the puppet Ministry of National Defense transported four trains of explosives in an attempt to destroy the mine when the Kuomintang bandit army fled. All the nearly 10,000 workers, police, and staff members were on high alert. The workers and police of each mine and factory formed mine protection and factory protection teams. They armed themselves with hand grenades, rifles, spears, iron picks, axes, and other weapons, and closely guarded each mine and factory. After dark every day, they electrified the power grids to prevent the bandit army from entering and leaving at will. In the end, the Kuomintang bandit army was intimidated by the organized actions of the workers and fled without destroying the mine. The entire Huainan Coal Mine was completely preserved intact.

　　淮南煤矿工警职员
  　英勇进行护矿斗争
    【新华社华东七日电】驰名江淮的淮南煤矿的一万多工人、矿警与战员在解放前有组织地进行英勇的护矿斗争，粉碎了国民党匪帮破坏和拆运机器物资的企图，完整地保存了矿厂及其一切资财，这种保护国家财富的英勇行动值得其他快要解放地区的矿厂工人学习。该矿北滨淮河，南倚淮阳山麓，面积达四十七万公亩，对江淮一带的工业与交通关系至巨。其开采历史有廿年，产量日有增加，由最初之日产量十吨曾增至二千吨。自淮南铁路全线通车，经营该矿之淮南矿务局及在同一矿区之大通煤矿公司均合并统一于淮南铁路总公司之下。该矿设备颇具规模，发展前途极大，预计最高产量可日达万吨。因其在江淮地区具备特要之地位，故在解放以前，国民党曾图加以破坏。溯自徐州解放以后，该矿上海总公司即特备专车想要拆运全矿器材南迁。该矿机厂工人立即罢工反对，并以铁轨堵塞铁道，阻止火车开出。九龙岗矿场西矿井下工王可真打电话通知东矿井刘尤香、袁孝云，双方联合，在“不准打破我们饭碗”的口号下，号召了三四千工人同时举行罢工，并有八百多工人冲到车站，看守火车。工人们包围了矿厂办公室，要求发给三个月薪津，六个月粮食，并与职员合作，成立护矿队，巡逻矿厂，监守器材，防止拆卸，检查行车。职工组织严密，联系密切，在斗争中互相支援，一发现有破坏和拆卸，便共同起而制止。由于职工们团结一致向国民党匪帮及总公司展开斗争，使其历次阴谋均遭失败。去年十一月二十四日，厂方又开来一次疏散车，九龙矿工人三千余立即出动拦车，并派人监护材料库。国民党匪军派来一个连镇压、连放十余枪，投掷四枚手榴弹，打伤工人万家福。工人以石头抗击，打伤匪军一名。迫使匪军不敢再行干涉。该矿职员们在工人力量的支持和为共产党政策及解放战争胜利形势的影响下，与工人一同护矿，保存档案表册，准备迎接人民解放军。一月十五日伪国防部运送来四列车炸药企图在国民党匪军逃跑时进行破坏，全体近万工警与职员，即紧张地戒备起来。各矿各厂工警均组成了护矿、护厂大队。纷纷以手榴弹、步枪、长矛、铁镐、斧头等武装起来，严密护守各矿厂。每日天黑以后，便把各处电网通以电流，禁止匪军任意出入。最后，国民党匪军为工人有组织的行动所慑服，未及破坏即行逃逸，整个淮南煤矿即完整无损地保存下来。
