Having Seen "The White Haired Girl"
    Li

The "White Haired Girl," recently performed in Peiping by the First Troupe of the North China University's Performing Arts Troupe, is a famous drama that has caused a sensation everywhere. It is a work of epoch-making significance. The persecution of Chinese peasants by Chinese feudal rulers was extremely profound. The opposition between these two classes constitutes a bloody picture of three thousand years of history. The drama "White Haired Girl" uses the most economical and concentrated artistic means to carve it into a microcosm. Moreover, due to the Chinese Communist Party's leadership in the land struggle, this drama has jumped out of the historical circle. It is no longer just a tragedy like past dramas, simply calling for sympathy. It points out a clear path for the peasants, which is to organize themselves and turn themselves over under the leadership of the Communist Party, and from then on embark on a new historical journey, forever becoming the masters of Chinese society.

At the beginning of the play, the author chose a windy and snowy New Year's Eve as the background of the story. New Year's Eve should be a day for the whole family to be happy and reunited, but in the old Chinese custom, it was the day when landlords and usurers forced debts and rents most fiercely. The landlord Huang Shiren used this day to force Yang Bailao to death and rob his only beloved daughter, Xi'er. There is nothing more tragic than this in the world! After performing this peasant tragedy, the play immediately presents Huang Shiren's family's luxurious hypocrisy. Huang Shiren, this rogue, eats, drinks, and sings all day long, living an extremely lewd life. In his words, "A woman is like the mud on the wall, peeling off layer after layer." His mother chants Buddhist scriptures all day long, but treats Xi'er in every possible way, neither being able to get close nor stay away. What is especially vicious is that after Huang Shiren rapes Xi'er and she becomes pregnant, he fears exposure and ruining the "family reputation." Shiren's mother and son, and the running dog Mu Renzhi, then try to frame Xi'er. Fortunately, Aunt Zhang Er rescues her, escapes from the tiger's den, and hides in the deep mountains. Due to lack of sunlight and nutrition, her hair turns completely white, hence the name "White Haired Girl." These two scenes further show the focal point of the contradiction between the two classes of landlords and peasants. On the Huang Shiren mother and son side, there is a group of oppressors (such as Mu Renzhi, etc.). On the Xi'er and Yang Bailao side, there are Lao Zhao, Dachun, Dasuo, Aunt Er, etc. Running dogs flatter the rich, and the poor sympathize with the poor. The class lineup is very clear. Yang Bailao and Lao Zhao's refusal to be humiliated, and the death of Bailao due to being bullied by the landlord, all aroused the struggle of Dachun and Dasuo, who beat the running dog Mu Renzhi severely. The peasants always remember the day of "General Guan sharpening his knife" in the nineteenth year of the Republic of China, and that the arrival of the "Red Army" would bring revenge. The whole play runs through this line—class contradiction—and profoundly performs it with many focal points of contradiction, so it is deeply moving, and the audience sheds tears of sympathy for it.

Of course, this cannot satisfy the audience. Finally, the day of revenge arrives. Following the arrival of the Japanese devils, the Eighth Route Army also arrives. Dachun, since beating Mu Renzhi, escaped and joined the Eighth Route Army. This time, he also returned home with the troops. The day for the people to turn over has arrived, but the landlord class is not submissive. They are still colluding with the enemy and using the superstition of the "White Haired Immortal" to deceive the masses, intending to continue to rule the people. Fortunately, the district chief of the democratic government and Dachun, etc., exposed the rumors, traced the cave, and rescued Xi'er. Thus, the truth is revealed, thereby breaking the masses' superstition, mobilizing the vast number of male and female peasants to carry out a liquidation struggle against the tyrant Huang Shiren, canceling this debt of blood and sweat, and the people turned over.

The advantages of this play: First, it runs through an extremely clear class viewpoint, consistently runs through the class struggle from beginning to end, so that the oppressed finally achieved victory, rather than a tragic ending. Second, it implements the leadership of the Communist Party. The beginning of the play proposes that the peasants are looking forward to the Communist Party leading them in their liberation struggle, foreshadowing the later text. The ending is completed by realizing the leadership of the Communist Party and completing the liberation. In history, there have been many peasant movements over more than three thousand years, but they all failed because they did not have the leadership of the proletariat. This victory of the peasants proves the self-evident truth that they must be led by the proletariat. Third, the subject matter organization is also relatively complete and rigorous, surpassing other turn-over dramas in the liberated areas. The fact of the "White Haired Girl" itself is very typical, and the technical performances are also excellent and moving.

### 看了“白毛女”

　　看了“白毛女”
    笠
    华大文工团第一团最近在平出演的“白毛女”，是轰动各地的一部名剧，她是具有划时代意义的作品，中国的封建统治者对中国农民迫害至为深巨，这两个阶级的对立构成了三千年历史的血腥图景，白毛女这个戏剧就用了最经济最集中的艺术手腕把它刻成了一幅缩影。不仅如此，由于中国共产党的领导土地斗争，使这剧也跳出了历史的圈子，它已不是象过去的戏剧那样永远只是一个悲剧，叫人同情而已；它给农民指出了一条鲜明的出路，就是在共产党的领导下自己组织起来翻身，从此以后踏上新的历史日程，永远做中国社会的主人。
    这剧一开始，作者就选择了一个大风大雪的除夕日，作为故事的背景，除夕日应该是一个全家快乐团聚的日子，但是中国的旧例，却是地主、高利贷者逼帐逼租最凶狠的一天，地主黄世仁便利用这个日子逼死杨白劳，劫走他唯一的爱女喜儿，人间惨事莫过于此！在表演了这个农民悲剧之后，紧接着就演出黄世仁的家庭豪华伪善，黄世仁这个流氓整天大吃大唱，过着极度荒淫的日子，就他的说法，“女人好比墙上的泥，剥下一层又一层”。他母亲成天念佛，而对于喜儿则是百般荷待，近不得远不得。尤其毒辣的是黄世仁强奸喜儿怀孕之后，又怕泄露，败坏“家声”，世仁母子及走狗穆仁智，即设法陷害喜儿。幸得张二婶搭救，逃出虎口，遁居深山，由于缺乏日光及营养，头发全白，“白毛女”因以得名。在这两场，更显示了地主与农民两个阶级矛盾的焦点，在黄世仁母子这方面是有压迫者的一群（如穆仁智等），在喜儿、杨白劳这方面，则有老赵、大春、大锁、二婶子等，走狗是阿谀富人，穷人是同情穷人，阶级阵容非常鲜明。杨白劳和老赵等的不肯屈辱，以及由于白劳之被地主欺凌致死，均激起了大春、大锁的斗争，痛痛快快的把走狗穆仁智揍了一顿。农民们始终惦念着民国十九年“关老爷磨刀”的一天，将来“红军”的到来是会复仇的。全剧是贯串了这一条线——阶级矛盾，并用许多矛盾的焦点深刻的演出，所以感人很深，观众们都为之洒下一掬同情泪。
    当然这是不能满足观众的，终于复仇的日子来到了，紧跟着日本鬼子来到之后，八路军也来到了，大春自从打了穆仁智以后，逃出参加了八路军，这次也跟部队回了家，人民翻身的日子来到了，但地主阶级并不是驯顺的，他仍然在勾结敌人，利用“白毛仙姑”的迷信去欺骗群众，意图继续统治人民，幸经民主政府区长和大春等，揭穿谣言，追迹山洞，救出喜儿，于是真象大白，由此，得以打破群众迷信，发动了广大男女农民向恶霸黄世仁进行了清算斗争，勾销了这笔血汗债，人民才翻身。
    这个剧的好处：第一、是贯串了极明确的阶级观点，自始至终贯串了阶级斗争，使被压迫者终于获得了胜利，而不是悲惨的结局。第二、是贯彻了共产党的领导，戏剧的开始就提出农民盼望着共产党来领导他们闹解放，为后文做了伏笔，最后是以实现了共产党的领导完成了解放为结局，历史上三千多年来曾发生过多次的农民运动，但都因没有无产阶级的领导而失败，这次农民的胜利证明了必须以无产阶级领导的天经地义。第三、题材组织亦较完整严紧，是超过了解放区的其他翻身剧，“白毛女”这一事实本身就是很典型的，至于技术的演出也很出色动人。
