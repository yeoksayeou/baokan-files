[Ji Lu Yu Electric Dispatch] In Machang Village, Guancheng County, farmers obtained the means of production after the land reform, and the milling sideline has greatly developed. Due to the development of the sideline, the land yield has also greatly increased. Machang Village has more than 280 households with a population of approximately 1,300. The village does not have much land. According to calculations after the land reform, each person has less than two mu of land. The land quality is also extremely poor. The east of the village is flying sand, and the west is alkaline land. Only a small part of the south and north of the village have better soil quality. If these soils are not fertilized, they will not produce much grain. The masses call this kind of land "buying and selling land" (meaning that you cannot make money without investing capital). Before the War of Resistance Against Japan, there were only a few mills in the village. The vast majority of poor farmers knew that milling was very helpful to agriculture, but they could not operate due to a lack of capital. Therefore, many farmers were forced to leave their homes and work elsewhere as laborers. However, since the establishment of our democratic government, with the implementation of the policies of rent reduction and interest reduction and reasonable burden, the farmers of the whole village have gotten rid of the exploitation of usury, and their burden has been reduced. Therefore, the milling sideline has developed. Especially after the land reform, the land of all the farmers in the village was returned to their families, and the milling industry has made unprecedented progress. At the beginning, the whole village increased to eight millstones, each millstone taking care of the lives of thirteen or fourteen families. Up to now, there are thirteen workshops in the village with thirteen millstones, and more than 200 families are regularly milling flour. The raw materials for milling are mostly grain produced in their own fields. In addition to supplying each family with some for their own consumption, the mill residue is mainly used to feed cattle and livestock. Now there are 200 livestock and 500 pigs in the village. In addition to cattle and pigs accumulating manure for the land, the production of the village's sandy and alkaline land has greatly increased. In this way, the lives of the masses have improved. Some have risen from poor peasants to wealthy middle peasants. Ding Chaoxuan, a poor peasant, is one such example. He has now increased from eight mu of land to more than twenty mu of land, some of which he bought by milling flour. Now his family raises a big sow, more than ten piglets, a cow, and a donkey, and the manure accumulated each year is no less than sixty carts. In the past, the five mu of bad land he bought could only produce one bag of grain. After he bought it, he applied eighteen carts of manure a year and got seven bags of grain. Wang Tianbao applied ten carts of manure per mu, and the highest yield was more than three bags. Now the alkaline land in the west of the village, which used to be a white expanse, is now covered with fat, green wheat seedlings. Inside the village, there are piles of manure and manure ponds one after another. According to the masses, the problem of the sales of milling flour has not yet been resolved, and the leadership is trying to help solve it.

　　观城马厂村农民喂猪积肥
  　多上粪碱地变良田
    【冀鲁豫电】观城县马厂村，土地改革后农民获得生产资料，磨粉副业大大发展，由于副业的发展，又使土地产量大大提高。马厂村共二百八十余户，人口约一千三百多，村里的土地并不多，按土地改革后计算，每人还不足二亩地，且地质极坏，村东是飞沙，村西是碱窝，仅村南和村北有一小部分土质较好。这些土质如不施肥，就打不多粮食，对这种地群众称之为“买卖地”（即不下本钱不能赚钱的意思）。该村磨坊副业在抗日战争以前只有很少几家，广大的贫苦农民虽知磨粉极有助于农业，因缺乏资本，无法进行经营。因此许多农民被迫背乡离井逃往他处当苦工。但自我民主政府成立后，随着减租减息，合理负担政令的推行，全村农民摆脱了高利贷的剥削，并且负担减轻，磨粉副业因而得到发展，尤其至土地改革以后，全村农民的土地归家，于是磨粉业更有了空前的进展，开始全村增到八盘磨，每盘磨照顾着十三、四家的生活，到现在为止，全村已有十三个作坊，拥有十三盘磨子，经常磨粉的就有二百余家。磨粉的原料多半是自己地里生产的粮食，粉渣除供养各家自吃一部外，主要是饲养耕牛家畜，现在全村已有牲口二百头，猪五百口。又加牛猪积肥上地，该村沙碱薄地就大大增加了产量。就这样，群众的生活改善了。有的已由贫农上升为富裕中农，贫农丁朝选就是这样的一个，现在已由八亩地增加廿多亩地，其中一部是靠磨粉买来的。现在他家喂了一口大母猪，十多个小猪和一头牛、一头驴，每年积的肥不下六十车，过去他买的五亩孬地，当时只能收一布袋粮食，他买过来后，一年上粪十八车打了七布袋粮食。王天保每亩地上十车，最高产量打过三布袋。现在村西一带碱地，过去是雪白一片，而今都长满着肥绿的麦苗。村内是一个连一个的大小粪堆和粪池。据群众反映：在磨粉的销路问题上还没解决好，领导上正在设法帮助解决。
