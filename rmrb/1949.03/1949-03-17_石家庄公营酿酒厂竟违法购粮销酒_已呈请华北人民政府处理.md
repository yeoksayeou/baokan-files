　　Shijiazhuang Public Winery Illegally Purchases Grain and Sells Alcohol; Case Submitted to the North China People's Government for Handling
    [Jizhong News] After the North China People's Government explicitly prohibited public stores from purchasing materials in neighboring areas, the Shijiazhuang Public Winery still illegally purchased grain in Baoding City. The Baoding Municipal Government has investigated and verified this and submitted it to the North China People's Government for handling. Without the approval of the North China Trade Corporation and without going through the public stores in neighboring areas, the winery, under the guise of "Wanyuan Yong," purchased a total of 87 shi and 4 dou of wheat and 10 shi and 3 dou of sorghum from February 11th to 13th. After the Baoding State-owned Trading Company discovered this, they advised the winery to stop the purchase, but it was ineffective. It was not until the morning of the 13th that the winery's business agents, Liu Xuzhen and Liu Houxun, were found, and the grain purchase was stopped. The matter has now been forwarded by the Baoding Municipal Government through the Jizhong Administrative Office to the North China People's Government for handling.
    Furthermore, after the liberation of Baoding last November, the winery set up a sales point in Baoding to sell alcohol. At that time, the North China People's Government was ordering all regions to gradually abolish the distribution of alcohol, prohibit consignment sales, strictly prohibit sales on credit, and stipulate that the sale of alcohol should have a transport and sales license from the Tax Bureau of the North China People's Government; otherwise, sales would not be allowed. However, the winery continued to illegally sell alcohol without holding legal documents until January 15th. Moreover, the distribution point only had one person, and in reality, consignment sales and sales on credit were the main methods (out of the 20,216 jin of alcohol transported from last December to this January, 15,166 jin were sold on consignment by Wanyuan Yong). Because there were too few people, the alcohol payments could not be remitted to Shijiazhuang in time, so 200,000 yuan of Renminbi was deposited with Wanyuan Yong Commercial Firm for eight days. The winery's illegal sale of alcohol and failure to remit alcohol payments in a timely manner is also detrimental to the state-owned economy.

　　石家庄公营酿酒厂竟违法购粮销酒
    已呈请华北人民政府处理
    【冀中讯】华北人民政府明令禁止公营商店到邻区采购物资以后，石家庄公营酿酒厂，仍在保定市违法收购粮食，现已由保定市府查明，呈请华北人民政府处理。该厂未得到华北贸易总公司批准，亦未通过邻区的公营商店，假借万源涌名义，自二月十一日，到十三日共购小麦八十七石四斗，红粮十石零三斗。保市国营贸易公司发觉此事后，曾当面劝其停购，却未生效。直到十三日上午找到该厂业务员刘绪贞、柳厚勋，才停止购粮。此事现已由保定市政府转冀中行署呈请华北人民政府处理。
    又该厂于去年十一月保定解放后，即在保设人销酒，当时华北人民政府正饬令各区逐渐取消酒的分销，禁止代销，严禁赊销，并规定销酒应有华北人民政府税务局的运销酒证，否则不允销酒。但该厂直至一月十五日前，仍未持合法证件，并继续违法销酒。而且分销处只设一人，实际以代销、赊销为主，（从去年十二月到今年一月共运来的酒二万二百十六斤中，让万源涌代销者即占一万五千一百六十六斤）因人手太少，酒款无法汇寄石家庄，便把二十万元人民币寄放到万源涌商号八天。该厂这样违法销酒，又不能及时上解酒款，对国营经济也有妨害。
