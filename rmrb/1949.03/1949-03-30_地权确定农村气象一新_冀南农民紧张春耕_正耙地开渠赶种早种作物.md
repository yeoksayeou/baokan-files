The confirmation of land ownership following land reform has brought a fresh look to rural areas. Farmers in southern Hebei, under the active leadership and support of the Party and the democratic government, are intensifying their spring plowing with unprecedented enthusiasm. The pace and effectiveness of spring plowing are significantly higher compared to last year. Last year, after the start of spring, farmers were generally slow in delivering manure and plowing the land. Many farmers, despite having received land, adopted a wait-and-see attitude because land certificates had not been issued and land ownership was uncertain. This year, the situation is completely different. Since the beginning of spring, there has been a new atmosphere of intense labor everywhere – delivering manure, hoeing wheat, watering, plowing, planting trees, sowing hemp... The land in the Third Special District has now been completely plowed. Areas along the river are finding ways to irrigate. Pingxiang plans to irrigate 6,200 hectares, and has already completed 85 percent of the task. The Second District of Ningnan has irrigated over 20,000 mu of wheat fields and over 6,000 mu of autumn land. According to last year's experience in irrigating wheat in the district, irrigated wheat fields can increase production by 40 to 60 jin per mu. The already irrigated 20,000 mu of wheat fields are expected to increase wheat production by more than 900,000 jin. Statistics from 72 villages in Qinghe show that over 70,000 mu of spring land have been plowed and 5,700 large carts of manure have been delivered. Statistics from 14 villages in Guantao show that over 28,000 hemp seeds have been planted, averaging 67 seeds per person, which can yield about 10 jin, which, in addition to self-sufficiency, can be sold in large quantities.

The reasons for these achievements, in addition to the direct encouragement from the completion of land reform and the assurance of land ownership for farmers, are mainly due to the strengthening of leadership over spring plowing by Party and government at all levels. At the beginning of the spring plowing work, the idea among village and district-level cadres and Party members that did not value production leadership became the first obstacle to carrying out the production movement. They believed that "farmers will produce on their own as long as they have land, and there is no need for leadership." As a result, they only distributed production plans to the villages with a simple call to action, and only assigned numbers for increasing the planting of cotton, peanuts, etc., to each household. In response to this method, the Xin County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party proposed that it could not stop at paper arrangements, but must widely and repeatedly explain the Party's policy of rewarding production through various meetings—branch meetings, mass meetings... and pay attention to "not violating the farming season" and seize the organization to complete the task. In order to ensure the completion of the planting plan, the Baixiang County Committee and County Government of the Chinese Communist Party had made three arrangements based on different situations, advocating first opening branch meetings, all village cadre meetings, group leader meetings... step by step to clarify the ideas, and then open mass meetings. After the county party committee made arrangements, it proceeded to inspection, and thus completed the planting task. The second obstacle in the spring plowing work was how to fight against the rumors of a few bad elements.

　　　　Exposing Bandit and Special Agent Rumors Stabilizes Mass Sentiment
At the beginning of the spring plowing, it was discovered that young and middle-aged people were fleeing in some places, which was caused by bad elements spreading rumors that we were going to conscript soldiers. When assigning the task of planting cotton and peanuts, rumors such as "planting flowers will increase the burden" were also discovered. However, because the leadership of production has been strengthened everywhere, these rumors can be quickly discovered and quickly exposed. In response to the problem of the flight of young and middle-aged people, Yuanzhao held victory celebration meetings in various villages, and conducted propaganda through mass and village cadre meetings. It was explained that the national victory was about to be achieved, we had cities, and by planting cotton, we could exchange for necessities, and everyone's life could be improved. Party members of the Dongshi Village branch in Yuanzhao took the lead in lending peanut seeds and encouraged the masses to borrow and lend freely. As a result, the rumors were self-defeating.

The biggest problem at present is that there are still some places in the production leadership that have the phenomenon of laissez-faire and coercive commandism. The idea that "the masses will produce without leadership" still needs to be overcome. In the specific planting arrangements, there are still many village cadres who go to each farmer with account books and ask: "How many mu of flowers are you planting?" If the answer is too little, they will say: "No! You have to plant a few more mu." There are also those who simply take the method of issuing orders and assign a certain farmer to plant a few mu of flowers. In addition, there are individual places that do not understand that production is the central task that overrides everything, and continue to force the end of land reform and party rectification work with too much force. In response to this phenomenon, the Jinnan District Party Committee proposed: Now that sowing is about to be organized, we must strengthen the specific leadership in production work, and check the reasons why the task cannot be completed at any time. And always pay attention to exposing all kinds of rumors and break the various concerns caused by rumors among farmers. For the various difficulties faced by farmers in spring sowing—such as the lack of plowing cattle, seeds, fertilizers, etc.—we must help solve them through various methods such as mutual aid and labor exchange.

### 地权确定农村气象一新  冀南农民紧张春耕　正耙地开渠赶种早种作物

　　地权确定农村气象一新
    冀南农民紧张春耕
    正耙地开渠赶种早种作物
    【本报讯】经过土地改革确定地权后的冀南各地农民，在党与民主政府的积极领导扶助下，正以空前无比的热情，加紧进行春耕。春耕的速率与效果，与去年比较是大大提高了。去年开春后，农民一般是慢吞吞地去送粪耙地………不少农民虽然已经分得了土地，但因土地证未发，地权未确定，因此采取观望态度。今年的情形完全不同了，开春以来，送粪、锄麦、浇水、耙地、植树、种大麻……到处都是紧张劳动的新气象。第三专区土地现已全部耙完，沿河地区都在设法浇地，平乡预计浇地六千二百顷，现已完成百分之八十五；宁南二区已浇麦地两万余亩，秋地六千余亩。根据去年该区浇麦经验，经浇的麦田每亩可增产四十斤至六十斤，已浇之两万余亩麦田，计可增产麦九十余万斤。清河七十二村统计已将七万余亩春地耙完，送粪五千七百大车。馆陶十四个村统计，种大麻籽达二万八千余棵，每人平均种六十七棵，可收获十斤左右，除自给外，可大量售出。
    获得这些成绩的原因，除由于土地改革的完成，农民取得了地权保证的直接鼓舞作用外，最主要的还是由于各级党与政府加强了对于春耕工作的领导。春耕工作开始时，村区级干部党员中不重视生产领导的思想成为开展生产运动的第一个阻力。他们认为：“农民只要有了土地，自己就会生产，不需要领导。”因而也就产生了只把生产计划分配到村号召一下就完事，增种棉花、花生等给各个农户派个数就行了。针对这种方法，中共莘县县委提出不能停止于纸面的布置，要通过各种会议—支部会、群众会……广泛反复讲解党的奖励生产的政策，并要注意“不违农时”，抓紧组织力量突击完成等。柏乡中共县委及县政府为保证种植计划的完成，曾前后依据不同情况，做过三次布置，提倡先开支部会、全体村干会、小组长会…一步一步弄通思想，再开群众大会。县委在布置之后，接着进行检查，这样才完成了种植任务。春耕工作中的第二个阻力是如何与少数坏分子的谣言做斗争。
    　　　　揭破匪特谣言　群众情绪安定
    春耕开始有地方发现青壮年逃亡现象，这是由于坏分子造谣说我们要抓兵造成的。在布置植棉种花生的任务时也发现“种了花多出负担”—等谣言。但由于各地对生产领导加强了，这些谣言很快能发现，并很快揭破了，元朝针对青壮逃亡问题，各村召开了庆祝胜利大会，通过群众及村干等会，进行宣传。说明全国胜利快实现了，我们有了城市，种了棉花，就能换回必需品，大家的生活就能改善。元朝东时村支部党员，自己带头借出花生种籽，并鼓励群众自由借贷。这样一来，谣言不攻自破。
    目前的最大问题是在生产领导上还有一些地方存在自流放任现象与强迫命令作风。“群众会生产不用领导的思想”还需继续克服。在具体布置种植中还有不少村干部是拿着帐本子到每个农户去问：“你种几亩花？”如果回答得少了，便说：“不行！得再种几亩。”还有是干脆就采取下命令办法，分派某个农户种花几亩。此外，还有个别地方，不大了解生产是压倒一切的中心工作，而以过多力量继续迫行结束土地改革与整党的工作。冀南区党委针对此种现象提出：目前即将组织下种，必须加强生产工作中的具体领导，随时检查任务不能完成的原因。并随时注意揭破各种谣言，打破农民因谣言而引起的各种顾虑。对于农民在春播中的各种困难——如缺少耕牛、种籽、肥料等……必须以互助、变工等各种办法帮助解决。
