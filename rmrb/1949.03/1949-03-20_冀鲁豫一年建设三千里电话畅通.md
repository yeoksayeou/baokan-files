[Hebei-Shandong-Henan Telegram] The Hebei-Shandong-Henan area achieved remarkable results in telephone construction in 1948, providing strong support for the Liberation War. Since the People's Liberation War, the area has been constantly in a state of war, with telephone lines being erected and dismantled frequently. However, arduous construction work has been carried out tenaciously, resulting in a large number of model workers. For example, Liu Hanyun, a communications officer of the Telephone General Bureau, erected cross-river lines on the Yellow River three times last year and created the "sitting bottom drilling" method, which greatly reduced the difficulty of erecting electric poles in the Yellow River rapids, allowing thirty people to plant a seven-zhang (approximately 23 meters) high pole. In 1947, one hundred and twenty laborers and telephone operators could not erect a five-zhang high pole. The area has also greatly overcome the guerrilla style of work in telephone construction. In recent years, they have learned to plant electric poles by boat and can make preparations such as driving piles, connecting poles, and surveying the terrain in advance, so that temporary cross-river lines can be erected successfully at one go. At the same time, work efficiency has been improved by adopting methods such as shift work and line repair registration. Because most of the cadres have not received specialized training and the telephone soldiers are mostly farmers, they were not proficient in erecting long-distance and urban lines in 1947, and communication failures often occurred over distances of 150 li (approximately 75 kilometers). In 1948, there were many improvements. The line from Zhang to Daxuzhuang, a distance of 220 li, which was built with self-raised funds, had good communication. In 1947, line loss was 462 li; in 1948, due to the combination of mass line protection work, line loss was only 135 li, mostly due to dramatic changes in the war situation that made it impossible to withdraw in time. By the end of 1948, the Telephone General Bureau had 18 county bureaus and 8 central bureaus. The total length of trunk and branch lines in the area was 2,346 li (excluding the 500-li Yellow River line from Changyuan to Qiyu). This year, in addition to connecting the third, fifth and some county offices, the construction of urban telephones will be strengthened.

　　冀鲁豫一年建设三千里电话畅通
    【冀鲁豫电】冀鲁豫区一九四八年的电话建设获显著成绩，予解放战争以有力支援。该区从人民解放战争以来，经常处于战争情况下，电话线时架时撤，但艰苦的建设工作，始终顽强地进行着，并从而产生了大批模范工作者。如电话总局通讯干事刘汉云，去年三次在黄河上架设过河线，并创造了“坐底钻”法，大大减少了在黄河激流中竖立电杆的困难，使七丈高的杆子，有三十个人就可以栽好。但一九四七年时，一百二十名民工和电话员还立不起五丈高的杆子。而该区在电话建设中，对游击作风亦大大克服。年来学会了用船栽电杆，并能在事先做好打拉桩、接杆、看地形等准备工作，故在临时架过河线时，一举成功。同时采用轮流值班，修线登记等办法，提高了工作效率。由于干部多未受过专门训练，电话兵又多是农民，一九四七年间，对架长途线、市内线还不熟练，一百五十里的距离，通话就时常发生故障。一九四八年间中，则有很多改进。自筹张至大徐庄二百二十里的线路，通话良好。一九四七年线路损失是四百六十二里，一九四八年由于结合了群众性的保线工作，仅损失线路一百三十五里，还是多因战争情况剧变来不及撤收。到一九四八年年底，在电话总局下已设有十八个县局和八个中心局，全区干线与支线，共长二千三百四十六里（从长垣到齐禹五百里的黄河线在外），今年除再架通三、五专署和一部份县份外，将加强城市电话之建设。
