Beware of Counterfeits

　　Recently, a fashionable "commodity" has appeared on the market - that is, some nondescript pamphlets. Things like "Land Reform Law," "Detailed Explanation of Urban Land and Housing Sales and Leases," "Urban Policy," as well as "Unauthorized Biography of Mao Zedong," "Autobiography of Mao Zedong," "How Stalin Rose to Power," and so on, with many different titles. Some of these pamphlets are excerpts from original works, but the vast majority are plagiarized and excerpted from various sources, taking things out of context, incompletely, inappropriately, or fundamentally incorrectly narrating and explaining the various policies of the Communist Party and the People's Government and the history of the Party's leaders; some even pretend to be speaking in the tone of Communists (and teach booksellers to say they are published by Xinhua Bookstore), fabricating a set of "urban land policies" for the Communist Party, claiming that "houses should be distributed" in the cities, that "the maximum amount of land and housing owned should be stipulated," and "anything exceeding this amount must be taken over," that "all urban houses and land, together with their buildings, belonging to organs, groups, temples, and monasteries, should be taken over and nationalized," and that "industrial and commercial entrepreneurs should be compensated for factory buildings, shops, dormitories, and residences," and so on. These gentlemen are so remarkably capable that they can "decide" and announce in advance things that the Communist Party and the People's Government have never decided!

　　The manufacturers of these pamphlets can be roughly divided into three categories: The first type wants to do some revolutionary propaganda and explanation for the people, but their political theory level is low, and their explanations are incorrect. It should be said that these people's intentions are good, but their current conditions are not suitable for doing this work. The second type is purely speculative merchants. They take advantage of the people's enthusiastic admiration for the Communist Party and its leaders and people's eagerness to understand the Party and the government's various policies, thereby creating fake goods and passing off fish eyes as pearls. They only want "sensationalism," only want "stimulation," only want "inside news" to expand their market, and have no political standards at all. Their only purpose is to deceive people into buying those goods and collect the people's currency. The third type is some saboteurs with ulterior motives. Their counterfeits are provocative, attempting to disturb people's minds; or they deliberately put forward excessively high and unrealizable slogans, arousing people's various beautiful fantasies, so that when these fantasies cannot be realized, they can incite people's dissatisfaction with the Communist Party and the People's Government, in order to achieve their purpose of undermining and slandering the revolution. The starting points of these three types of people are different, but the pamphlets they produce are detrimental, even seriously detrimental, to the interests of the masses.

　　Therefore, our readers should beware of counterfeits when looking for books to study the theories and policies of the Communist Party. The current policies of the Communist Party in Tianjin and Beijing are the Eight Articles of Agreement of the Tianjin-Beijing Frontline Headquarters, and the proclamations of the Military Control Commission and the Beijing Municipal Government; the main decisions and instructions on land policy and urban policy can be found in the book "The Current Situation and Our Tasks" (standard edition) and the resolutions of the Sixth National Labor Congress; to understand the Communist Party, you can study the Constitution of the Communist Party of China, Comrade Liu Shaoqi's report on the revision of the Party Constitution, and On the Self-Cultivation of Communists, etc. There is no similarity whatsoever between these and those pamphlets. As for those pamphlets, it is obvious that they were neither compiled and printed by the Communist Party and the People's Government, nor have they been approved by them. Readers can easily see that they are fake goods with counterfeit names if they are a little careful. The Party, government, and people of Beijing are now vigorously carrying out a cleaning and sanitation campaign. The garbage in this batch of harmful publications should also be removed in this campaign to prevent its harm from spreading. We also suggest that the Beijing Military Control Commission specifically organize this cleanup and formulate measures for book publishing and reprinting to eliminate this chaotic counterfeit phenomenon.

　　谨防假冒
    近来市场上出现一种时髦的“商品”——这就是一些不伦不类的小册子。什么“土地改革法”，什么“城市土地房屋买卖租赁问题详细解释”、“城市政策”，以及“毛泽东外传”、“毛泽东自传”、“斯大林怎样起家的”等等，名目很多。这些小册子有些是选自原著，但绝大多数是东抄西摘，断章取义，不完全、不切当、或根本错误地叙述与解释共产党与人民政府的各项政策和党的领袖的历史；有的居然冒充共产党人的口气（并教给书贩子说是新华书店出版的）替共产党杜撰一套“城市土地政策”，宣称在城市中要“分配房屋”，要规定“拥有地皮房屋的最高数额”，“超过此数即须接收”，要对“机关、团体、庙宇、寺院、所有城市的房屋土地连同其本身建筑，一律予以接收归公”，要对“工商业家补足厂房、店铺、宿舍、住宅”等等。这些先生们居然如此神通广大，能够把共产党和人民政府从来没有作过决定的事情，事先替他们“决定”和公布出来！
    这类小册子的制造者，大体上可分三类：第一种是想给人民做一点革命宣传解释的工作，但是政治理论水平低，解释得不正确。应该说这种人的用心还是好的，只是他们现在的条件还不适宜于做这个工作。第二种是纯粹的投机商人。他们利用人民对于共产党及其领袖仰望的热情和人们极欲了解党与政府各项政策的心理，从而就大造假货，鱼目混珠。他们只要“轰动”，只要“刺激性”，只要“内幕新闻”，以扩大其市场，根本没有什么政治标准，其目的不过是把那些货色骗出去，把人民券骗进来。第三种是一些别有用心的破坏分子，他们的伪造品富有挑拨性，企图扰乱人心；或故意提出过高的不能兑现的口号，引起人们的各种美丽的幻想，以便在这些幻想不能实现的时候，煽起人们对共产党与人民政府的不满，以便于达到他们破坏与中伤革命的目的。这三类人的出发点不同，但是他们制造的这些小册子，对于人民群众的利益都有损害，甚至严重的损害。
    所以，我们的读者在寻找研究共产党的理论与政策的书籍时，应谨防假冒。共产党在平津的现行政策，有平津前线司令部的约法八章，和军管会与北平市政府的文告；关于土地政策与城市政策的主要决定和指示，可见于“目前形势和我们的任务”（标准本）一书与第六次全国劳动大会的决议；想了解共产党，可研究中国共产党党章、刘少奇同志关于修改党章的报告和论共产党员的修养等。这和那些小册子，没有丝毫相同之处。至于那些小册子，很明显的，既不是共产党和人民政府编印的，也决未经过它们批准。读者只要稍为细心，即可看出是冒名的假货。北平市的党政与人民，现在正用大力开展清洁卫生运动。对于这一批有害的出版物中的垃圾，也应当在这个运动中加以清除，以免其流毒为害。我们并建议北平军管会，具体组织这个清除工作，并制定书籍出版和翻印的办法，以消灭这种混乱的假冒现象。
