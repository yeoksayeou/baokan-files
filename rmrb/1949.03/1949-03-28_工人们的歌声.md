　　The Songs of the Workers
　　Collected by Hai Tao

　　Living in Tangshan, which is known as the "People's Coal Capital" and "Heavy Industrial Zone," makes me feel happy and proud because I can often live with the workers and have the opportunity to learn a lot from them.

　　Here, I have collected a few poems that I think are very good works by the workers.

　　Among these, five are written by themselves, and three are compiled by me based on the general idea of their oral accounts.

　　From these works, we can see how the workers' awareness is improving, how new labor attitudes and technologies are leaping forward and improving, and how the concept of being "masters of their own affairs" has been established in their hearts.

　　Yes, today, what is more worthy of praise than sacred labor? Listen: this is the song of their labor:

　　　　I. Two Worlds
　　"Hoe digging, shovel scraping, big lumps of coal, separated. I used to come to find you, and I was really scared in my heart. It was all black and I couldn't see anything, and a 'whack' sound meant my life was gone. Now the democratic government has come, there are lights all over the tunnels, and it's safe to go up and down the well. Three good meals a day, and also learning to read. No one calls us 'coal blacks' anymore, and we walk with our backs straight."

　　This piece is by Wang Liankui, a worker at the Kaiwan Coal Mine, who uses contrast to reveal the true face of two worlds and two kinds of lives.

　　　　II. "This is Our World"
　　A female worker named Li from the Huaxin Cotton Mill is very short and can't reach the machine when sitting. Before liberation, she asked the supervisor to allow her to put something under her seat, but the supervisor refused. She had to stand to work. Now, she speaks of her past suffering and her happiness after liberation. "Before, this spinning machine was like a coffin. I was afraid when I saw it. I am short, and the supervisor told me to stand and wind. Standing and winding was really hard. My legs ached and my back hurt like climbing a mountain of knives. I straightened my back and raised my head, but the supervisor didn't allow it. Since liberation, this spinning machine is like a bridal sedan, making people happy and loving. You connect the ends, and I wind. Several sisters come to thread, and four hundred spindles spin happily, completing the winding in twenty seconds. Everyone is vying to be a model worker, working hard to support the front, straightening their backs and daring to raise their heads. This is our world."

　　　　III. Transformed
　　"The car is good, the car is wonderful. The engine starts with a step on the gas pedal, and it runs when you shift gears. Transporting grain, transporting coal, transporting cement, transporting steel, more than a dozen trips back and forth a day. You are not afraid of getting lost on windy days, and you are not afraid of mud on rainy days. You work hard through the mud and water, and you don't complain about hardship or fatigue, all for supporting the front and fighting the enemy. From now on, I will take good care of you, check it often, wash it often, and fill it with gasoline, engine oil, and grease. When the task comes, I won't be in a hurry. Beep beep! With a press of the horn, I drive in the front."

　　This piece was written by a 19-year-old driver named Zhang. He worked at the Kailuan Mine. Before liberation, he was naughty and lazy. After liberation, he worked actively and cherished the car as his own life, truly achieving not wasting a drop of gasoline.

　　Xu Hancheng, a worker who used to sleep in the engine room of trains before liberation, now works doubly hard. He was involved in the assembly of the new "Tangshan" locomotive. After it was assembled, he made up a jingle: "New Tangshan, you are like a bridal sedan, assembled in three days and three nights, wiped bright, painted new, wholeheartedly transporting the People's Liberation Army. Going to Tianjin, going to Beiping, driving as fast as the wind, brothers, don't relax in making contributions!"

　　　　IV. "The Eight Immortals Cross the Sea" Show Their Skills
　　Zhang Shengming, a worker at the Jibei Power Company, was unwilling to use the technology he had learned before liberation. After liberation, he understood that the proletariat was the master of the new China, so he contributed all his skills: "Everyone listen to me, before liberation, the cook couldn't eat enough, the carpenter's house had no doors, the mason's house leaked, and the tailor wore ragged clothes. Our power company, often machines hurt our eyes, dark and without light. Since liberation, the generator hums, inside and out like a crystal world, 'The Eight Immortals Cross the Sea' show their skills, I will also work hard, because we are the masters of China!"

　　　　V. "We Are Steel"
　　Liu, an ironworker at the Tangshan Locomotive Factory, improvised a jingle by the furnace while holding a large iron hammer: "Forging! Forging! So lively! Big hammer on top, small hammer below, ding ding dang clang forming a 'Victory Chorus,' what does a sweat mean? A wash and it's clean. Sparks jump on the clothes, a burnt hole is even more glorious! Now it's a democratic government, give as much strength as you have, make things to fight the enemy!"

　　　　　　　　　×　　　　　　　×　　　　　　×

　　Old Yue, a worker at the Tangshan Steel Plant, even more actively called on everyone to work hard and increase production. He said in a jingle: "Hey! We're here to make steel. You stoke the fire, I operate the furnace, we want to melt the iron, we want to refine the steel. Each furnace bottom, we want to produce more furnaces of steel. We sweat, we still have to work harder. We are steel, steel will not be tired."

　　Yes, can steel be tired? This is a good example of the proletariat.

　　　　VI. Paint "Carry the Revolution Through to the End!" on the Teapot!
　　Li Xiangdong, a worker at the Tangshan Desheng Porcelain Factory, couldn't even finish reading the newspaper before liberation. After liberation, thanks to the factory's education, he can finish reading Chairman Mao's "On New Democracy": Before liberation, we were all like monks and nuns, sculpting Buddhas every day, with aching backs, sore legs, and blurred eyes, our heads filled with mud. Since liberation, we are no longer monks and nuns, learning to read, learning to read books, everyone vying to read "On Coalition Government." Everyone rushes to work, and the things we make are solid and simple. On the teapots, we no longer paint "Goldfish," "Beauties," and "Orchids," but write: "Carry the Revolution Through to the End!" and "Fight to Taiwan!"

### 工人们的歌声

专栏：

　　工人们的歌声
    海滔采辑
    生活在这被称为“人民的煤都”和“重工业区”的唐山，使我感到幸福和骄傲，因为我能经常地和工人们生活在一起，而有机会去向他们学习很多东西。
    这里，我搜集了几篇诗歌，我认为是很好的工人们的作品。
    这几篇当中，有五篇是他们自己写的，有三篇是我依照他们口述的大意而编写的。
    从这些作品中，我们可以看出工人们的觉悟是怎样地在提高，新的劳动态度与技术是如何地在飞跃的增长与改进，而做“主人翁”的观念，已在他们的心间树立了起来。
    是的，在今天，除了神圣的劳动还有什么更值得歌颂？听吧：这就是他们劳动的歌声：
    　　　　一、两个世界“锄头挖，铁铲扒，大煤块，分了家。从前我来把你找，心里实在怪害怕，乌黑一片看不见，哗嗒一声命就送。如今民主政府来，地道上面全有灯，上井下井都安全。一天美美三顿饭，还有学习把书念。没人再把煤黑子叫，走起路来也直起腰。”
    这一篇是开湾煤矿工人王连奎用对比的方式，道出了两种世界，两种生活的真面目。
    　　　　二、“这才是咱们的世界”
    华新纱厂一个姓李的女工，人长得很矮小，坐着够不上机子。未解放前，她要求监工准她坐的地方垫块东西，可是监工不答应，她只好站着做工，现在，她道出往日的痛苦和解放后的高兴。“从前这台纱车象棺材，见了它我就怕起来。我的个子矮又小，监工叫我站着络，站着络来真难过，腿疼腰酸象上刀山，直直腰来抬抬头，监工看见都不行。自从解放后，这台纱车象花轿，令人喜来又令人爱，你接头来我来络，好几个姐妹来上线，四百个锭子转的欢，二十秒钟就络完。大家纷纷争模范，努力劳动生产支前，腰也直起头也敢抬，这才是咱们的世界。”
    　　　　三、转变了“汽车好，汽车妙，马达一踩发动了，排档一换就开跑。运粮食，运煤炭，运洋灰，运铁钢，一天来回十几趟，刮风天你不怕迷了眼，下雨天你不怕路上澜。踏着泥水你拚命干，你不辞劳苦不怕累，都是为了支前打敌人。从今后，我要好好把你保管，常检查，多洗擦，汽油机油黄油都加满，任务来了我就不忙不乱。哔哔！喇叭一按，我开在最前面。”
    这一篇是一个十九岁的张司机写的，他在开滦矿服务，未解放前调皮，贪懒，解放后，他工作积极，把汽车当作自己的生命那样爱惜，切实做到了不浪费一滴汽油。
    　　　　　　　×　　　　　　　　×　　　　　　×
    未解放前，常在火车机头房睡大觉的工人徐汉成，现在做工也加倍努力，在装新唐山号机车时，就有他，装好后，他作了一个顺口溜：“新唐山号，你象个花轿，三天三夜就装好，擦的亮，漆的新，一心要运解放军。上天津，上北平，开起车来快如风，大家兄弟们，立功不要放松！”
    　　　　四、“八仙过海”显一手
    冀北电力公司工人张生明，未解放前他把所学的技术，不愿使出来；解放后，他明了了无产阶级才是新中国的主人翁，于是他把技能全贡献出来：“大家听我说一遍，没有解放前，厨子吃不饱饭，木匠屋里没有门，瓦匠房里漏着天，裁缝穿着破衣衫。我们电力公司，常常是机器害眼睛，黑暗黑暗没有光明。自从解放后，发电机突突叫，里里外外象水晶世界，‘八仙过海’显一手，我也要努力把工做，因为我们是中国的主人翁！”
    　　　　五、“咱们就是钢铁”
    唐山机车厂一个刘铁工在火炉旁，手中提着大铁棰顺口溜起来：打铁！打铁！真热烈！大榔头上，小榔头下，叮叮当当合成“胜利大合唱”，汗流一把那算啥？洗个脸来就干净。火星子跳到衣服上，烧个窟窿更光荣！如今是民主政府了，有多少力气出多少，制出来东西，好去打敌人！
    　　　　　　　　　×　　　　　　　×　　　　　　×
    唐山炼钢厂的工人老岳更积极地号召大家努力工作，提高生产量，他顺口溜道：“嘿！我们来炼钢。你烧火，我司炉，要把铁烧化，要把钢炼成。每一次炉底，要多出几炉钢。我们身上出了汗，我们还要加油干。咱们就是钢铁，钢铁不会有疲倦。”
    是的，钢铁能会有疲倦吗？这正是无产阶级的好榜样。
    　　　　六、茶壶上画上“将革命进行到底”！
    唐山德盛瓷厂工人李向东未解放前，还不能全看完报，解放后，由于工厂的教育，可以看完毛主席的“新民主主义论”：没有解放前，我们都象和尚和尼姑，天天在这塑菩萨，腰疼腿疼眼睛花，脑袋里面充满了稀泥巴。自从解放后，我们不再是和尚和尼姑，学识字，学看书，大伙儿争读“论联合政府”。上班大家都抢着做，做出的东西都结实朴素，在茶壶上面，我们不再画“金鱼”“美人”和“兰花”，而写上：“将革命进行到底！”和“打到台湾去！”
    　　　　　　　　　　　　　　一九四九、三月，唐山
