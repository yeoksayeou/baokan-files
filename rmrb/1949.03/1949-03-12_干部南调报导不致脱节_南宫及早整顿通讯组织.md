　　【Our Newspaper's Report】The Nangong County Committee attaches importance to communication work. At the joint meeting of district branch secretaries to arrange this year's production, communication work was also arranged. Each district was required to do a good job in rectifying and developing communication organizations, and to conduct reporting in a timely manner. Comrade Zhang Yang, the head of the County Committee's Propaganda Department, carefully studied how to carry out county-wide communication work and organize reporting in the current situation of cadre southward transfers and the changing of the guard. Regarding the rectification and future development of communication organizations, the County Committee proposed the following measures: (1) Each district should have at least three people writing articles to form a communication team and elect a team leader to be responsible for reporting on various tasks in the district. If there are people in the district with strong writing skills who have often written articles in the past, they can be temporarily assigned to be specifically responsible for the district's reporting work; (2) Many of the comrades going on the southward expedition this time are correspondents. Therefore, each district must re-register the existing correspondents; (3) Those with writing skills and those who have written articles in the past but are not correspondents should be developed into new correspondents; (4) For the registration meeting of new and old correspondents, the Propaganda Department should prepare the correspondent registration form in advance, distribute it to each district, and send it to the County Committee Propaganda Department immediately after registration. Reporting guidelines: Because this year's central task is large-scale production, reporting should also be centered on production. How each district deploys production work to the villages, the ideological mobilization of cadres and the masses, the masses' subscription to household plans, the addition of agricultural tools, the purchase of livestock, and the large-scale accumulation of fertilizer should all be reported in a timely manner. Other tasks, such as war support work and seeing off southward-bound cadres, should also be done well in reporting. In short, communication and reporting work should not be affected because some of the cadres who serve as correspondents are going south.

　　干部南调报导不致脱节
  　南宫及早整顿通讯组织
    【本报讯】南宫县委重视通讯工作，在布置今年生产的区支部书记联席会上，同时把通讯工作作了布置，要各区作好整顿、发展通讯组织，及时进行报导。县委宣传部长张扬同志，认真研究了目前干部南调、新旧交替的情况中，如何开展全县通讯工作和组织报导问题。关于通讯组织的整顿与今后发展问题，县委提出以下办法：（一）每区至少要三个人动手写稿，成立起一个通讯小组，并选出组长，负责本区各种工作的报导；区里如有写作能力强过去经常写稿的人，可以让他暂时专门负责本区的报导工作；（二）这次南征的同志中有好多是通讯员，因之各区要把现有的通讯员，作一次重新登记；（三）把有写作能力的及过去曾经写过稿子而不是通讯员的同志，要发展为新的通讯员；（四）进行新老通讯员登记会上，宣传部应预先划好通讯员登记表，分发到各区，登记后马上寄交县委会宣传部。报导方针：因为今年的中心工作是大生产，报导同样应以生产为中心。各区如何把生产工作布置到村里去，对干部群众的思想动员、群众订按家计划、添买农具、购买牲口、大量积肥等，都要及时报导。其他如战勤工作，欢送南征干部等，都要努力作好报导工作。总之，不要因为有一部分担任通讯员的干部南下，而影响了通讯报导工作。
