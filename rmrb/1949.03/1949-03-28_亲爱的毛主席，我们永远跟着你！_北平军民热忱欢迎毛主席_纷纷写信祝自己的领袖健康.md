　　Dear Chairman Mao, we will always follow you!
    The military and civilians of Beiping warmly welcome Chairman Mao
    Many write letters wishing their leader good health
    [This newspaper's dispatch] After Chairman Mao, Commander-in-Chief Zhu, and others arrived in Beiping, the military and civilians of Beiping expressed their warm welcome and felt boundless honor.
    Jiang Shifa, a soldier who participated in the review and received the Mao Zedong Medal for his bravery in the Battle of Tashan, thought during the review: "Wearing the Mao Zedong Medal is already glorious enough, but I never expected to see Chairman Mao himself. I must continue to perform meritorious service for the people." The liberation fighters of the Fifth Company of the 367th Regiment said: "We just joined the People's Liberation Army and already saw Chairman Mao, what an honor! We must work hard." Hu Guize, a cook in the Second Company of the Guard Battalion of the 41st Army, regretted not being able to participate in the review due to illness and couldn't sleep all night. The next morning, he ran to the street to buy two newspapers and asked others to read them to him. After hearing the news of Chairman Mao's arrival in Beiping, he excitedly said: "Great! This counts as seeing our leader!" Chairman Mao's simple and kind impression was deeply imprinted on everyone's hearts. Zhu Danan, a soldier of the First Company of the 367th Regiment, said with emotion: "Chairman Mao wears the same clothes as our soldiers, he is truly the leader of our people." When Chairman Mao got off the car at Xiyuan, Tian Yaotian, a guard, stood beside Chairman Mao and wanted to get closer to take a look, but Chairman Mao took the initiative to approach him and ask him questions. He returned and happily told others: "Chairman Mao is so kind."
    Many workers in Beiping have not yet met Chairman Mao, but they have written letters to Chairman Mao one after another, wishing him good health, expressing their respect and love for their leader. Wang Leqi, a worker in the Inspection Section of the 70th Arsenal, wrote: "Chairman Mao, our respected leader, yesterday you came to the ancient city of Beiping. We in Beiping have suffered twenty years of oppression, and the workers are liberated under the leadership of the Communist Party! After you come to Beiping, we are closer to our leader." The letter written collectively by the molding group workers said: "Chairman Mao, we are very happy and proud to have the opportunity to write to you today." At the end, they wrote: "We will stand at our posts, follow in your footsteps, and strive to produce according to what you said: 'More production, high quality, low cost, and good sales,' to support the liberation of all Chinese people." The workers of Qinghe Mud Factory held a grand "Celebration of Chairman Mao's Arrival in Beiping and Labor Army Mobilization Meeting" on the afternoon of the 26th, and rushed out a special bulletin board edition. The workers said: "We welcome our leader Chairman Mao to Beiping, and we must expand the labor army movement."
    More than a thousand students at Tsinghua University were watching the Soviet drama "The Rainbow" in the auditorium when they heard the news of Chairman Mao's arrival in Beiping. They immediately shouted "Long live Chairman Mao!" "Long live Commander-in-Chief Zhu!" and sang the song "Dear Chairman Mao Zedong, we will always follow you..."

　　亲爱的毛主席，我们永远跟着你！
    北平军民热忱欢迎毛主席
    纷纷写信祝自己的领袖健康
    【本报讯】毛主席、朱总司令等来北平以后，北平军民表示热忱欢迎，并感到无上光荣。
    参加检阅的战士姜世发，他是在塔山战斗中荣获毛泽东奖章的，在检阅时就想着：“我戴上了毛泽东奖章就够光荣了，想不到又看见了毛主席，我一定要为人民继续立功。”三六七团五连解放战士们说：“我们刚参加了解放军就看见了毛主席，多么光荣啊！我们一定要好好干。”四十一军警卫营二连炊事员胡贵泽因病没有参加检阅，他后悔的一夜没有睡着觉，第二天一早便跑到街上买了两张报纸，让别人念给他听，毛主席到北平的消息，他听了后兴奋的说：“好哇！这也就算我看了咱领袖了！”毛主席朴素亲切的印象，深深的印上了大家的心坎。三六七团一连战士朱大南感动的说：“毛主席穿的衣裳和我们战士一样，这真是咱人民的领袖。”警卫员田耀田当毛主席刚到西苑下车的时候，他站在毛主席身旁，很想靠近看一看，想不到毛主席却先走向他问话，他回来高兴的向别人说：“毛主席真亲热。”
    北平工人们很多还没有见过毛主席，但是他们纷纷给毛主席写信，祝毛主席健康，表现了对自己领袖的崇敬和热爱。第七十兵工厂检验课工人王乐齐写道：“毛主席我们敬爱的领袖，昨天你竟已来到古老的北平了，我们在北平受了二十年的压迫，工人是在共产党领导下解放啦！你来北平以后，我们更靠近我们的领袖啦。”营铸组工人集体写的信里说：“毛主席，我们今天有机会给你写信，觉得万分高兴和骄傲。”末尾并写道：“我们一定站在自己的岗位上，跟着你的脚步，按着你所说的‘生产多，品质高，成本低，销路好’的话努力生产，支援全中国人民的解放。”清河制泥厂的工人在二十六日下午开了个盛大的“庆祝毛主席来平及劳军动员大会”，并赶着出了壁报特刊。工人们说：“咱们欢迎领袖毛主席来北平，更要扩大劳军运动。”
    清华大学千余同学正在大礼堂看苏联名剧“虹”，听到毛主席来平的消息，立刻高呼“毛主席万岁！”“朱总司令万岁！”并唱起“亲爱的毛泽东主席，我们永远跟着你……”的歌来。
