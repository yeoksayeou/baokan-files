　　真理报著文评国家预算
    【新华社陕北十九日电】苏联一九四九年预算中收入与支出的增加，其主要来源是社会主义工业利润的增加。真理报在论预算的社论中称：一九四九年的国家预算最突出的特点之一，便是收入的进一步增加。预算规定一九四九年的收入比一九四八年增加百分之九，支出增加百分之十二点六。出入相抵以后，且将盈余三百零六亿五千三百三十万卢布。这种增加主要地是依靠苏联社会主义工业利润的递增。苏联一九四九年的工业利润将比一九四八年增加百分之七十七点二。这些利润的增加，是依靠加强成本计算，提高企业的利润率及加速货品与物资的流转来取得的。预算的执行将要求进一步改进国民经济一切部门的工作。按照规定，工业中的劳动生产率今年将增加百分之十四，建设中的劳动生产率增加百分之十二，生产成本至少将减低百分之六，工业生产质量的指数也将提高，社会主义资金积累也将进一步增加。莫斯科劳动人民又已发动了争取加速流动资金周转的运动。争取进一步增加社会主义工业利润，加强国家的财政力量。
