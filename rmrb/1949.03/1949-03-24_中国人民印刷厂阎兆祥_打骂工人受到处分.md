　　China People's Printing Factory Yan Zhaoxiang
　　Disciplined for Beating and Scolding Workers
　　[Our Newspaper] On the 15th, when the cooperative of the China People's Printing Factory in Peiping City was processing stock registration for employees and their families, a young ticket-drying worker, Feng Rong Sheng, over-reported one person and therefore entered one extra share (according to him, it was only his father and son, his father being a thirty-year veteran boiler worker in the factory who had already registered on his own, but Feng Rong Sheng registered his father again). Fearing that he would not receive food rations in the future, he went to the cooperative to ask Comrade Yan Zhaoxiang (a cadre sent by the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions) of the work team to withdraw the share. At the time, because he was busy with work, Comrade Yan Zhaoxiang's attitude towards the worker was poor, and the two had an argument. Yan, in a fit of anger, raised his hand and struck Feng's face. Feng dodged, and his face was scratched a little by Yan's fingernails. Afterwards, the workers persuaded them to stop.
　　Comrade Yan Zhaoxiang, working with the workers in the factory, should have patiently persuaded and resolved the problem, but instead raised his hand to hit people. This fully demonstrated his lack of class perspective, his loss of the nature of serving the people and the working class, violating Party discipline, and damaging the relationship between the Party and its own class. Therefore, Comrade Yan Zhaoxiang committed an error of principle. Regarding this error, the CCP Peiping Municipal Committee decided to give him a public warning within the Party, and to publicly and formally apologize to the workers, admitting his error. The Municipal Federation of Trade Unions also decided to remove him from his post.
　　Afterwards, Yan Zhaoxiang fully accepted the punishment given by the superiors. At 8:00 p.m. on the 18th, he convened a factory-wide workers' meeting (attended by approximately 1,000 people). At the meeting, Comrade Yan Zhaoxiang formally apologized to the workers, admitted his error, and guaranteed that he would never make such a mistake again. The next day, it was announced on the blackboard newspaper that he had been removed from his post. The worker comrades were very satisfied with the way Comrade Yan Zhaoxiang's problem was handled, and their understanding of the Communist Party's policy of not hitting or scolding people became clearer.
　　Decision of the Peiping Municipal Committee: Comrade Yan Zhaoxiang was working with the workers in the factory, and this time, disregarding the Party's policies and ignoring Party discipline, he beat and scolded Feng Rong Sheng, a ticket-drying worker in the factory, fully demonstrating his lack of class perspective and losing the stance that a Communist Party member should have. The Party decided to give him a public warning within the Party to educate Comrade Yan Zhaoxiang himself and to raise the vigilance of all Party members and cadres.
　　Decision of the Preparatory Committee of the Peiping Municipal Federation of Trade Unions: The Preparatory Committee of the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions believes that Comrade Yan Zhaoxiang's behavior of beating and scolding fellow workers is a serious manifestation of the bad style of bureaucracy and commandism, violating the Party's policies. In order to give Comrade Yan Zhaoxiang and all trade union cadres a profound education, the following decision is made: 1. Comrade Yan Zhaoxiang shall convene a workers' meeting at the factory and apologize to the beaten fellow worker Feng Rong Sheng and all workers, admitting his error. 2. Organizationally, Comrade Yan Zhaoxiang shall be given the punishment of removal from his post.

　　中国人民印刷厂阎兆祥
    打骂工人受到处分
    【本报讯】十五日平市中国人民印刷厂合作社，正在为职工及其家属们办理入股登记手续时，一个年轻的烘票组工人冯荣升，因其多报一人、而多入了一股（按其中只父子二人，父为厂内三十年之老锅炉工人，前已自行登记，冯荣升又将其父登上），后恐将来不发给他食粮，就进入合作社去找工作组的同志阎兆祥（市职工总会派往的干部）给他退股，当时因工作忙碌，阎兆祥同志对该工人态度不好，双方因此发生争吵，阎盛怒之下伸手就朝着冯的脸上打去，冯一躲，脸被阎的指甲划破了一点，后工人们就把他们劝开。
    阎兆祥同志在工厂内作工人工作，对工人不能耐心地说服和解决问题，反而张手打人，充分表现了没有阶级观点，丧失了为人民服务、为工人阶级服务的本色，违犯党的纪律，破坏了党与本阶级的关系。因此，阎兆祥同志是犯了原则性的错误。对于这一错误，中共北平市委决定党内给予当众警告处分，并公开的、正式的向工人群众道歉承认错误，市职工总会并决定撤销其工作。
    事后，阎兆祥完全接受上级给予的处分，在十八日晚八时，召集了全厂的工人大会（到会的约有一千余人），会上阎兆祥同志向工人正式道歉，承认错误，保证今后绝对不犯这样的错误，次日在黑板报上公布撤销其工作，工人同志对于这样处理阎兆祥同志的问题，感觉都很满意，对于共产党的不打人骂人的政策，在认识上更加明确了。
    北平市委处分决定：阎兆祥同志是在工厂内作工人工作的，此次不顾党的政策，漠视党的纪律，竟打骂厂内烘票组工人冯荣升，充分表现了没有阶级观点，丧失共产党员应有的立场，党内决给予当众警告处分，以教育阎兆祥同志本人并提高全党党员、干部的警惕。
    北平市职工总会筹委会处分决定：市职工总会筹备会，认为阎兆祥同志打骂工友的行为，是严重的脱离群众的官僚主义强迫命令的恶劣作风，违反了党的政策，为了给阎兆祥同志及全体职工工作干部以深刻的教育，特作如下决定：一、在该厂召集职工会大会由阎兆祥同志向被打工友冯荣升及全体职工道歉，承认错误。二、在组织上给阎兆祥同志以撤职的处分。
