Xinhua News Agency, Xing County, 1st -- The Third Jin-Sui Women's Congress was held in Xing County from the 12th of last month and closed on the 20th. Seventy-eight people attended, including Jin-Sui women labor heroes, cadres, reporters, students, and Mongolian ethnic representatives. During the nine-day session, the delegates enthusiastically discussed the CCP Central Committee's decision on the current work of rural women in the liberated areas, and summarized the achievements and shortcomings of women in Jin-Sui over the years in supporting the front lines, developing production, participating in political life, and striving for freedom of marriage. Comrade Zhang Ziyi, Deputy Secretary of the CCP Jin-Sui Branch, pointed out in his report to the congress: The future direction of Jin-Sui women's work is first and foremost to mobilize and organize all women to further participate in agricultural production and strive to complete the task of increasing grain production by 200,000 shi in the entire region in 1949. Only in this way can we practically break the bad habit of valuing men over women left over from the old society and achieve true equality between men and women. He called on Jin-Sui women to actively support the People's Liberation War, train a large number of women cadres, and strive to learn culture, policies, specialized knowledge, and skills. In order to adapt to the needs of the new victorious situation, the congress re-elected the executive committee of the Jin-Sui Democratic Women's Federation, elected 21 new formal executive committee members, and formed a new executive committee, with Gu Nan as chairman and Jiang Bao and Wu Ruzhen as vice-chairmen. The congress also elected Li Peizhi, Zhang Yuying, Gu Nan, Li Qing (Mongolian) and ten others as representatives to attend the National Women's Congress. The congress also unanimously passed a telegram of respect to Chairman Mao of the Chinese Communist Party, the leader of the Chinese people, and Commander-in-Chief Zhu of the Chinese People's Liberation Army.

　　晋绥妇代会选出代表
    【新华社兴县一日电】晋绥第三届妇女代表大会，于上月十二日在兴县召开，二十日闭幕。出席者有晋绥妇女劳动英雄、机关干部、记者、学生、蒙古民族代表等七十八人。在前后九天会期中，到会代表们热烈讨论了中共中央关于目前解放区农村妇女工作的决定，总结了历年来晋绥妇女在支援前线、发展生产、参加政治生活和争取婚姻自由等方面的成绩和缺点。在中共晋绥分局副书记张子意同志在大会上报告时指出：今后晋绥妇女工作的方向首先就是动员与组织全体妇女群众进一步参加农业生产，为完成一九四九年全区增产廿万石粮食的任务而斗争。只有这样，才能实际打破旧社会所遗留下来的重男轻女的恶习，达到男女真正的平等。他号召晋绥妇女积极支援人民解放战争，大批培养妇女干部，努力学习文化、政策、专门知识与技能。为了适应新的胜利形势的需要，大会改选了晋绥民主妇女联合会执行委员会，选出新的正式执委二十一人，组成新的执行委员会，以谷南为主席，姜宝、吴儒珍为副主席。大会并选出了李培之、张育英、谷南、李青（蒙古人）等十一人为出席全国妇女代表大会的代表。大会并一致通过向中国人民领袖中国共产党毛主席和中国人民解放军朱总司令驰电致敬。
