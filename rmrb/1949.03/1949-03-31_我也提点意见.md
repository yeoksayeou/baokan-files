　　I Also Offer Some Opinions
　　After the land reform, the desire of our broad masses of male and female peasants to establish happy and fulfilling families is very urgent. Therefore, it is very necessary for our liberated areas to promulgate unified marriage regulations. However, family relationships are also part of the superstructure of the socio-economic base. What kind of economic base there is, there will be what kind of family system. The family is built on a changing and developing economic base, not on moral concepts. Therefore, based on the opinions of Comrades Yang Yunyu and Tian Xiujuan on January 28th, I offer the following subjective views.
    One, Comrades Yang and Tian believe that: If married persons have poor feelings and cannot bear to live together, regardless of whether both parties or any one party insists on filing for divorce, and mediation proves ineffective, they should be granted a divorce.
　　My opinion: If married persons have poor feelings due to major reasons, are politically incompatible with each other, or have become hostile, and actually cannot bear to live together, and this has been the case for a considerable period of time (at least half a year), regardless of whether both parties or any one party insists on filing for divorce, and mediation proves ineffective, they should be granted a divorce.
　　We should resolutely oppose: people who use freedom of divorce as a shield to satisfy their desires for novelty and achieve their freedom to indulge in lust.
　　Two, Comrades Yang and Tian believe that: Regardless of whether there are abnormal male-female relationships, as long as the male and female parties or one party cannot live together anymore and insist on divorce, they can be granted a divorce. They should have complete freedom when remarrying after divorce.
　　My opinion: If the male and female parties or one party have abnormal male-female relationships, as long as they cannot live together anymore and insist on divorce, they should be subject to appropriate punishment (at least a fixed-term imprisonment of not more than half a year) before they can be granted a divorce. They should have complete freedom when remarrying after divorce.
　　We should resolutely oppose any irresponsible "free love" behavior.
　　In short, today's marriage problem in China is a very complex social problem. It must be based on our current socio-economic foundation, be conducive to the people's liberation war, and be based on the principles of independence and voluntariness of both men and women to solve the current love problems of young men and women.

### 我也提点意见

　　我也提点意见
    土地改革后，我广大男女农民要求建立美满幸福的家庭，是很迫切的；所以，我解放区公布统一的婚姻条例，是很必要的。不过，家庭关系也是社会经济基础的上层建筑的一部份；什么样的经济基础，就有什么样的家族制度，家族是建立在变化的发展的经济基础上，而不是建立在道德观念上。所以，根据一月二十八日杨蕴玉、田秀娟二同志的意见，提出下面几点主观的见解。
    一、杨、田二同志认为：已婚者因感情恶劣，不堪同居，无论双方或任何一方坚持提出离婚，且经调解无效时，都应准其离婚。
    我的意见：已婚者因重大原因而感情恶劣，政治上已互不相容，或形成敌视时候，实际不堪同居，且有相当时间者（最少半年），无论双方和任何一方坚持提出离婚，且经调解无效时，都应准其离婚。
    我们应坚决反对：利用离婚自由为护符来满足其喜新厌旧的情欲目的，而达到其逞欲自由的人们。
    二、杨、田二同志认为：男女双方或一方，不管有没有不正常的男女关系，只要无法再同居，而坚持离婚者，都可准其离婚。在已经离婚后再行结婚时，应有完全自由。
    我的意见：男女双方或一方，如有不正常的男女关系时，只要无法再同居，而坚持离婚者，都应受相当处分（最少半年以下的有期徒刑）后，才可准其离婚。在已经离婚后再行结婚时，应有其完全自由。
    我们应坚决反对不负责任的任何“杯水主义”的行动。
    总之，今天我们中国的婚姻问题，是很复杂的社会问题，必须依据我们现阶段的社会经济基础，有利于人民解放战争、基于男女双方的自主自愿等原则，来解决当前青年男女的恋爱问题。
