[Jizhong News] In order to correctly implement the labor movement policy of "both labor and capital benefit and develop production," the Hejian City Trade Union recently inspected thirteen "labor-management contracts" already signed by seven industrial and commercial households. It was found that when signing contracts, trade unions at all levels in the city, because they were eager to achieve results, did not fully mobilize the workers before starting to sign contracts, resulting in capitalists and master craftsmen depriving workers and apprentices of their right to speak in contract negotiations, generally forming employer or master-dominated contracts; in some cases, the workers who signed the contracts were not even aware of them. For example, the bosses of Ruixing and Luoquanpu privately wrote in the contract when the workers returned home: "Workers receive sixty jin of rice per month and are not allowed to leave the shop or raise wages within one year." The apprenticeship period was generally too long; for example, learning to make bicycle axles, three years is considered a short term, but learning to make felt strips at Yongqing Felt Factory was also written as three years in the contract, which is too long.

In the profit-sharing system of workers and capitalists jointly operating, the contract also stated: "One share per year, no advance or shortfall allowed by anyone," which increased many difficulties for the workers.

The city's trade union has already corrected or declared invalid the above unreasonable contracts, correcting the right-leaning erroneous thinking of some street trade union cadres. They are mostly handicraftsmen with apprentices, so when leading the signing of contracts, they did not consider the welfare of the workers at all, holding the idea of wanting the capitalists to gain more, and using the excuse of "accumulating capital and expanding operations." The union decided that in the future, it should vigorously mobilize workers to make them truly aware of and understand the correct policy of "both labor and capital benefit, and develop production," before signing reasonable contracts.

### 未经劳资协议所订合同　河间市职工会宣布无效  各地应注意检查资方包办合同现象

　　未经劳资协议所订合同
  　河间市职工会宣布无效
    各地应注意检查资方包办合同现象
    【冀中讯】河间市职工会为正确贯彻“劳资两利发展生产”的工运政策，最近对七家工商户已订立的十三张“劳资合同”进行了检查工作。发现本市各级工会在订立合同时，因为急于求成，没有把工人充分发动起来，就开始进行订立合同，致使资方与师傅剥夺了工人、学徒订立合同中的发言权，而一般形成资方或师傅的包办，甚至，订合同工人根本就不知道。如瑞兴和罗圈铺的老板在工人回了家去的时候，就私自在合同上写：“工人每月六十斤米，一年内不许离店，不许涨工钱。”学徒年限一般也订得过长，如学做自行车子轴，三年为期满，就不算短，可是象永庆毡厂学做毡条也在合同上写三年为满期，就太长了。
    工人和资方合伙经营的分红制，合同上也写着：“一年一分，不许任何人长支短欠”，这就增加了工人的不少困难。
    本市职工会对以上不合理的合同，业已进行纠正或宣布无效，纠正了某些街工会干部的右倾错误思想。他们多是些带有徒弟的手工业者，因此在领导订立合同时，根本没有考虑到工人福利，抱着是想叫资方多沾点光，而借口是“积蓄资本，扩大经营”。该会决定：今后应大力发动工人，使之真正觉悟与了解“劳资两利，发展生产”的正确政策，然后再订立合理的合同。（郭立平）
