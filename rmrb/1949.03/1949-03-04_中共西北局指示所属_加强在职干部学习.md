　　Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 1st. The Northwest Central Bureau of the CPC issued instructions on the study of on-the-job cadres this year on the 15th of last month, calling on Party committees at all levels under its jurisdiction to quickly establish and strengthen on-the-job cadre study committees headed by administrative leaders, and ensure that all on-the-job cadres have an average of two hours a day to study theory, policies, and culture. In order to urge on-the-job cadres to step up their studies, the instructions require that all learning units of Party committees at all levels must establish strict examination and inspection systems; the learning results of cadres should be included in the appraisal and used as one of the criteria for promoting cadres. The instructions pointed out that since the Northwest Bureau issued instructions on the study of on-the-job cadres on July 1 last year, in the past six months, the main responsible cadres of Party committees and military political organs at all levels personally led the study of on-the-job cadres, and conducted inspection work, inspection of thought, and inspection of leadership with the spirit of criticism and self-criticism. A relatively serious and earnest criticism was made of empiricism, anarchic indiscipline, individualism, and bureaucratic work styles, and considerable achievements were made. However, on the other hand, many cadres, including senior cadres with considerable long-term experience in revolutionary work, still lack theoretical knowledge of Marxism-Leninism, lack in-depth research on the basic issues of the Chinese revolution, and even lack the necessary cultural level. There are still bureaucratic, empiricist, and anarchic indiscipline phenomena in their work. Many cadres cannot or are not good at using the Marxist-Leninist stance, viewpoints, and methods to deal with various practical problems, so that the various policies stipulated by the Party Central Committee are sometimes not correctly implemented. To change this situation, it is necessary to vigorously strengthen the study of general on-the-job cadres and improve the ideological and political level of cadres at all levels. To this end, the Northwest Bureau instructed that cadres with general reading ability and considerable work experience must study "History of Social Development", "Political Economy", Mao Zedong's "On New Democracy", "The Chinese Revolution and the Chinese Communist Party", "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art", Liu Shaoqi's "Report on the Revision of the Party Constitution" and the General Program of the Party Constitution adopted by the Seventh National Congress of the Communist Party of China, and "A Short History of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks)" Chapter 4, Section 2 and other works and documents this year, in addition to studying policies. In order to gain a deep and systematic understanding of the Party's various policies, all cadres must carefully study "On New Democracy" and "The Chinese Revolution and the Chinese Communist Party." As for cadres with too low a cultural level, the instructions stipulate that regardless of their position, they should focus on learning culture.

　　中共西北局指示所属
  　加强在职干部学习
    【新华社延安一日电】中共西北中央局于上月十五日发布今年在职干部的学习指示，号召所属各级党委迅速建立与加强行政首长为首的在职干部学习委员会，保证所有在职干部每天平均有两小时时间学习理论、政策和文化。为督促在职干部加紧学习，指示要求各级党委一切学习单位，必须建立严格的考试制度及检查制度；干部学习成绩应列入鉴定，作为提拔干部的标准之一。指示指出：自从去年七月一日西北局发布关于在职干部学习的指示后，半年来由于各级党委和军队政治机关主要负责干部亲自领导了在职干部的学习，以批评与自我批评的精神，进行了检查工作、检查思想、检查领导，对经验主义、无政府无纪律状态、个人主义思想以及官僚主义作风，作了比较严肃认真的批判，获得了不少成绩。但是另一方面，许多干部，包括有相当长期革命工作经验的高级干部在内，至今仍然缺乏马列主义的理论知识，缺乏对中国革命基本问题的深刻研究，甚至于缺乏必要的文化水平，工作中还有官僚主义、经验主义与无政府无纪律现象存在，许多干部不能或不善于运用马列主义的立场、观点与方法去处理各项实际问题，使党中央所规定的各项政策有时未能正确贯彻。要改变这种情况，就必须用大力来加强一般在职干部的学习，把各级干部的思想水平政治水平提高一步。为此西北局指示规定凡具有一般阅读能力和相当工作经验的干部，除学习政策外，今年必须读“社会发展史”、“政治经济学”、毛主席所著“新民主主义论”、“中国革命与中国共产党”、“在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话”、刘少奇同志“关于修改党章的报告”及中共第七次全国代表大会通过的党章总则、“联共（布）党史简明教程”第四章第二节等著作与文件。为了求得对党的各项政策有深刻的系统的理解，所有干部必须精读“新民主主义论”和“中国革命与中国共产党”两书。至于文化程度过低的干部，指示规定不论职位高低，均以学习文化为主。
