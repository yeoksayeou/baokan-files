【Tianjin Electric】The Tianjin General Machinery Repair Factory has officially resumed operations. The factory was originally the Tianjin Automobile Manufacturing and Repair Factory under the Highway Administration Bureau of the puppet Ministry of Communications. After merging with the puppet "Bandit Suppression" General Machinery Repair Factory moved from Zhangjiakou in early December last year, it was renamed its current name. After the merger, the reactionary Kuomintang government forced the factory to produce munitions, disrupting the original production system for automobile manufacturing and repair technology, which caused strong dissatisfaction among the workers. After the factory was taken over this time, the Military Control Commission decided, based on the actual situation, that the machinery and workers of the original automobile manufacturing and repair factory would continue to produce automobile parts, and the organization for automobile manufacturing and repair technology, which had been disrupted by the Kuomintang, would be restored.

【Tianjin Electric】Workers at the No. 1 Factory of the Tianjin General Machinery Repair Factory, in an emergency situation of a sudden power outage during production, disregarded danger and used manpower to replace the electric crane, avoiding a great loss. In the foundry department of the factory, when a 1.5-ton electric furnace was melting iron on the 18th, a full furnace of molten iron was just ready to be transported to the molds of more than 200 piston rings to begin casting. Suddenly, the entire factory lost power, and all machines stopped working. If this furnace of iron juice, which was over 1,000 degrees hot, were to cool and solidify, not only would the fuel, electricity, and manpower be wasted, but also the electric furnace, which had just been fitted with 700 kilograms of magnesia, would be damaged, and it would take at least three or four days to repair and start work. Therefore, the factory employees immediately took action and replaced electric power with physical strength. Foreman Jie Zhenhe took the lead in picking up a large iron bar and led six workers to lift the heavy iron furnace package. Electrical worker Lan Shaoxiang also helped everyone to turn the large wheel on the iron furnace with great force, gradually letting the iron juice accurately flow into the small iron packages, which were alternately poured into the piston ring molds to be cast into finished products. After more than 20 minutes of intense work, this task was successfully completed.

【Tianjin Electric】The Tianjin Publicly-Owned China Match Factory, the largest in the Tianjin area's match industry, resumed operations on the 22nd of this month. The factory has 56 stem arranging machines, 24 stem unloading machines, and a 60-horsepower horizontal boiler. At its peak, it produced 2,000 boxes of Hengzi brand matches per month (based on 25 days per month).

【Tianjin Electric】Thanks to the efforts of the staff, the maximum power generation of the No. 1 Power Plant of Tianjin Ji-North Electric Power Company has exceeded the highest record before liberation. On the 22nd of this month, the instantaneous maximum power of the plant had reached the safety limit of the generator - 12,500 kilowatts. At the same time, the boiler department also increased the steam pressure, and the turbine department also worked hard to maintain a normal vacuum, jointly achieving this new peak load. Most of the important factories using the plant's electricity have resumed work, and the small factories in the eastern district of Tianjin are no longer restricted in their power supply.

Xinhua News Agency, Zhangjiakou, 1st - After liberation, the employees of the public enterprises such as the Xiahuayuan Power Plant, Zhangjiakou Power Plant and Zhangjiakou Telecommunications Bureau of the Ping-Sui Railway, under the leadership and education of the trade union, have initially established a new attitude towards labor and gradually improved their work efficiency. The coal transportation workers of the Xiahuayuan Power Plant have changed their "go-slow" attitude under the rule of the Kuomintang, and each person now transports coal in eleven trips per day (eight hours) instead of eight. The water tower of the plant was missing three impellers, and there were no replacements. After research by workers such as Xu Wenzhang, impellers were cast with copper, and the water tower was repaired. Workers at the Zhangjiakou Power Plant automatically repaired a batch of machines damaged during the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang government despite various difficulties, including two 800-kilowatt transformers, three hydraulic nozzles, an electric pump with a 3-inch diameter water channel, and a 685-horsepower induced draft fan. More than 40 workers from the Telecommunications Bureau rushed to repair the telecommunications line from Chaigoubao to Tianzhen in eight days, completing the work originally estimated to take fourteen days.

### 津市总合修理厂复工　公营中华火柴厂恢复生产

　　津市总合修理厂复工
  　公营中华火柴厂恢复生产
    【天津电】天津市总合修理机器厂，已于日前正式复工，该厂原为伪交通部公路总局汽车修配总厂所属天津汽车制配厂。去年十二月初伪“剿匪”总合修理机器厂，由张垣搬来与该厂合并后，改称现名。合并后，国民党反动政府迫令生产军火，因而打乱了原有汽车制配技术方面的生产系统，职工们对此深表不满。此次该厂被接管后，军管会根据实际情况，决定原汽车制配厂的机器职工仍生产汽车零件，并将已被国民党打乱的汽车制配技术方面的组织重新恢复。
    【天津电】天津总合修理机器厂第一工厂工人，于生产中骤然停电的紧急情形下，不顾危险，以人力代替了电动起重机，避免了很大的损失。该厂铸冶部，当十八日容量一吨半的大电炉熔铁时，满满一炉刚化成液体的铁汁，正准备用电动起重机运向二百多箱活塞环的模子处开始铸造，忽然全厂停电，一切机器都不能运转。这一炉达一千多度高热的铁汁，如果冷却凝固，不但这些燃料和电力、人力白白浪费，并且刚装配上七百公斤镁砂的电气炉，也将毁坏，至少三四天才能修复开工。因此该厂员工立即大家动手，以体力代替电力。领班工人解振和，第一个抄起大铁杠，领导六个工人抬起笨重的铁炉包。电气工人兰少乡也帮助大家用大力搬转了铁炉上的大轮盘，渐渐的让铁汁准确的流入一个个的小铁包，轮番倾入活塞环模子内铸成成品。经过二十几分钟紧张工作，此项工作始顺利完成。
    【天津电】天津一带火柴工业中规模最大的天津公营中华火柴厂已于本月二十二日复工。该厂拥有排梗机五十六台，卸梗机二十四台，六十匹马力卧式锅炉一部。产量最高时每月产恒字牌火柴达两千箱（每月以二十五天计算）。
    【天津电】由于职工的努力，天津冀北电力公司第一发电厂的最高发电量，已超过解放前最高纪录，本月二十二日该厂瞬时最大电量，已临到发电机的安全界限——一二五零零千瓦，同时锅炉部也加高汽压，汽机部也努力维持正常真空度，共同实现了这新的尖端负荷。现使用该厂电力的重要工厂，已大部复工，津市东区的小工厂，动力亦不再受到限制。
    【新华社张家口一日电】解放后的平绥路下花园发电厂、张家口发电厂及张市电讯管理局等公营企业职工，在工会领导教育下，初步树立了新的劳动态度，逐渐提高了工作效率。下花园发电厂的运煤工人已转变了他们在国民党统治下的“磨洋工”态度，每人每天（八小时）运煤由八趟增加到十一趟。该厂水塔坏了三个水轮，无代替品，经工人许文章等研究结果，以铜彷铸成了水轮，遂将水塔修好。张家口发电厂工人在种种困难下，自动修好了国民党反动统治时期损坏的一批机器，其中有八百基罗瓦特的变压机两部，水力龙头三个，水道直径三寸的电泵一部，六百八十五匹马力的引风机一部。电讯管理局四十余工人。抢修柴沟堡至天镇的电讯时，以八天时间突击，完成了原来预计十四天才能完成的工作。
