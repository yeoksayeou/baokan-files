　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, March 12th: TASS, Washington reports: At the Far Eastern Commission meeting on March 3rd, the Soviet representative to the Far Eastern Commission, Pan Youxin, requested the Far Eastern Commission to pay attention to the appeal of the Japanese labor union representatives on February 15th. They demanded that the Japanese government be prevented from implementing MacArthur's anti-democratic and anti-labor measures. After pointing out that MacArthur had no right to arbitrarily interpret and implement the resolutions of the Far Eastern Commission, Pan Youxin stated: According to MacArthur's directive of July 22, 1948, the Japanese government, in November of last year, formulated an amendment to the "Public Service Personnel Service Law," enacted the "Public Corporation Labor Relations Law" on December 11th, and announced draft amendments to the "Labor Dispute Resolution Law" and draft trade union laws on February 14th of this year. Because these laws deprive Japanese workers of their legitimate right to fight for the protection of their legitimate interests (rights granted in the Far Eastern Commission resolution), the Soviet representative specifically requested the Far Eastern Commission to pass the following motions: (1) Declare that the above-mentioned anti-labor measures of the Japanese government are aimed at depriving Japanese workers and staff of the possibility of safeguarding their legitimate rights, and are in violation of the Far Eastern Commission's resolution of June 19, 1947, on the "Basic Post-Surrender Policy Toward Japan" and the resolution of December 6, 1946, on the "Principles of Japanese Trade Unions." (2) The Supreme Commander of the Allied Powers in Japan must take necessary measures to abolish the Japanese amendments to the "Public Service Personnel Service Law" and the "Public Corporation Labor Relations Law" and to prevent the passage of the aforementioned draft labor dispute resolution law and draft trade union law. (3) Urge the Supreme Commander of the Allied Powers in Japan to pay attention to the need to take measures to prevent the Japanese government and the Japanese Diet from taking actions that violate the parts of the Potsdam Declaration relating to Japan and the political resolutions of the Far Eastern Commission. Discussion of the Soviet proposal has been postponed to the next meeting.

  　苏代表提议保护日工人利益
    【新华社陕北十二日电】据塔斯社华盛顿讯：远东委员会苏联代表潘友新，在远东委员会三月三日会议中，要求远东委员会注意二月十五日日本工会代表的呼声。他们要求阻止日本政府执行麦克阿瑟的反民主反劳工措施。潘友新在指出麦克阿瑟无权随意解释及随意执行远东委员会的决议之后，声称：依据麦克阿瑟一九四八年七月二十二日指令，日本政府于去年十一月间，订立了修正“公务职工服务法”，十二月十一日制定了“公营公司劳工关系法”，并于本年二月十四日公布了修正“劳工争议解决法”草案及工会法草案，由于这些法案是剥夺日本职工为维护其合法利益而斗争的正当权利（远东委员会决议中所许给的权利），因此，苏联代表特要求远东委员会通过如下议案：（一）宣布上述日本政府反劳工措施乃旨在剥夺日本工人及职员维护其合法权利的可能性，并系违背远东委员会一九四七年六月十九日关于“日本投降后的对日基本政策”的决议，及一九四六年十二月六日关于“日本工会原则”的决议。（二）驻日美占领军总司令必须采取必要措施，以废弃日本修正“公务职工服务法”及“公营公司劳工关系法”，以阻止前述劳工争议解决法草案及工会法草案之通过。（三）促使驻日美军总司令注意，必须采取措施以阻止日本政府及日本国会采取违背波茨坦宣言中关于日本的各部分以及远东委员会政治决议的行动。关于苏联建议的讨论，已延至下次会议进行。
