To the Editor: Cui Zhixuan of Zhuangtou Village, Fourth District, Xingtang, has ten mu of jointly owned land located in the North Gate of Xingtang, which has been rented and cultivated by Gao Weixin of the West Gate for many years. Last year, after Cui's land was confiscated during the land reform, he was allocated several mu of other land. The ten mu of land in the North Gate is still cultivated by Gao Weixin. However, when calculating the agricultural tax burden this year, Gao Weixin included the land in the North Gate under Cui's name. How should this problem be resolved? Who should bear the agricultural tax?

　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　De Lin, Fourth District, Xingtang

Answer: Regarding the issue of Cui Zhixuan's jointly owned land, your letter is somewhat ambiguous. Our understanding is that this is essentially a question of land ownership. Whoever owns the land bears the agricultural tax. If this land is still allocated to Cui Zhixuan, then he should bear the agricultural tax. If it has not been allocated to him, Cui Zhixuan should declare this to the village farmers' association and request a correction. After the district, village, or county government makes the correction, he will no longer bear the agricultural tax. If this land has not yet been allocated and is temporarily cultivated by Gao Weixin, then he should temporarily bear the agricultural tax, and the grain produced from the land should also belong to him.

　　地权属谁，谁出负担
    编辑同志：行唐四区庄头村崔智轩，有伙地十亩，座落于行唐北关，历年由西关高维新租种。去年土改时崔之土地被没收后又另分了几亩地，北关十亩地仍由高维新耕种，今年造农业税负担时，高维新却把北关之地造在崔的身上。这问题应如何解决？农业税该何人负担？　　　　　
　　　行唐四区德林
    答：关于崔智轩等之伙地问题，你的来函中说得有些含糊。我们的了解，基本上是个地权问题。就是土地属谁所有，农业税便归谁负担，如果这块地仍分给崔智轩所有，就该由他负担农业税。如果没有分给他，崔智轩就应向村农会声明，请求更正。经区村或县府改正以后，他便不负担农业税了。如果这块地尚未分配，暂由高维新耕种，农业税也暂由他负担，地里出产的粮食，也就归他所有。
