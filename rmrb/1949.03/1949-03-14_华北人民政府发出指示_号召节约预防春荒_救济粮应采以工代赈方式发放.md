The North China People's Government Issues Instructions
    Calling for Thrift to Prevent Spring Famine
   Relief Grain Should Be Distributed Through Work Relief

    [This newspaper dispatch] North China has been basically liberated, but the newly recovered areas have suffered heavily from enemy destruction, and the disaster situation is quite serious. Last year, some areas also experienced water, drought, and insect plagues. Therefore, preventing spring famine and carrying out disaster relief are of utmost importance. On February 22nd, the North China People's Government issued instructions on preventing spring famine and disaster relief to governments at and above the county level, pointing out that famine prevention and disaster relief should be planned comprehensively based on the principles of "thrift to prevent disaster, production for self-salvation, mutual assistance among the masses, and work relief." Whether in disaster areas or non-disaster areas, thrift should be universally promoted, waste should be opposed, and substitute foods should be preserved. The goal of striving for production should be based on the amount of grain shortage in each household before the wheat harvest. The instructions stated: These actual figures are especially important in disaster areas; and grain loans must be carefully allocated and production organized based on different local conditions. All industrial and commercial departments, trade companies, public stores, and cooperatives should make efforts to help the masses' sideline production, especially the sideline production of the masses in disaster areas, providing raw materials, purchasing finished products, organizing transportation, and opening up sales channels. The instructions also stated: Because of the shortage of rain and snow last winter, all localities should pay attention to preventing the prevalence of spring epidemics and insect plagues, and remove locust eggs as early as possible; if epidemics are found, they should be suppressed as early as possible. Wheat fields should be properly protected, and irrigation should be organized in a timely manner. In spring plowing work, the masses should be mobilized to help each other, adjust seeds, eliminate wasteland, and prepare properly. In severely affected areas, the planting of various early-maturing plants should be promoted.

    Regarding the organization of the masses to produce for disaster relief, the instructions also put forward specific measures, ordering special districts and counties in severely affected areas to establish production and disaster relief committees, absorbing relevant departments to participate, and unifiedly lead the disaster relief work. Overcome the masses' simple waiting for relief and reliance mentality, and call on them to organize and produce for self-salvation. Governments at all levels should earnestly help them find ways to produce. The issuance of relief grain and funds must be through production to achieve the purpose of relief; and because the amount is limited, it is only through production that the effectiveness of relief can be brought into play. Therefore, the issuance of grain and funds should first adopt the method of work relief, such as organizing disaster victims to repair canals, roads, dig ditches, and improve beaches; or adjusting war service, such as organizing disaster victims to transport grain and earn foot fees; secondly, there should be key points, and it should not be used equally. Villages that are severely affected by disasters should be issued as soon as possible; the objects of issuance should be the poor working class people. Poor and hard-working martyrs', soldiers', and workers' families and hard-working poor farmers who have been most severely affected by disasters should be given priority for relief.

    Finally, the instructions pointed out that in the past, there were many malpractices in the distribution of relief grain in various places, such as some cadres not understanding the system, or being afraid of trouble, spending at will, or having no standards and not taking care of the overall situation; some cadres had a granting point of view and egalitarianism; some cadres simply relied on government relief and did not pay attention to organizing mutual assistance among the masses, reducing the mutual assistance and mutual relief power among the masses; and even some cadres spoke of personal feelings and violated the principles of relief, etc. The instructions hope that all localities will pay strict attention to the distribution of relief grain in the future, so as to make the best use of everything and avoid waste.

　　华北人民政府发出指示
    号召节约预防春荒
  　救济粮应采以工代赈方式发放
    【本报讯】华北已经基本解放，但新收复地区，因遭敌人摧残，灾情颇重；去年部分地区亦有水、旱、虫灾，因之预防春荒，进行灾区救济，至关重要。华北人民政府于二月二十二日对县以上各级政府发出预防春荒及救灾指示，指出防荒救灾应以“节约防灾，生产自救，群众互助，以工代赈”为原则全盘筹划，无论灾区与非灾区，均应普遍提倡节约，反对浪费，保存代食品，并根据各家麦收以前缺粮数目，以为生产奋斗之目标。指示称：这种实际数字，在灾区尤为重要；并必须依据各地不同条件，认真分配贷粮，组织生产；各工商部门、贸易公司、公营商店及合作社，对于群众副业生产，特别是灾区群众副业生产，应努力帮助，供给原料，收买成品，组织运输，打通销路。指示又称：因去冬雨雪短少，各地应注意防止春疫及虫灾之流行，发现蝗卵，早日刨除；发现流行病，早日扑灭。对麦田尤应妥加保护，及时组织浇地。春耕工作，应发动群众互助，调剂种籽，消灭荒地，准备妥善。灾重地区，则提倡多种早熟植物。
    对于组织群众生产救灾，该指示并提出具体办法，令各灾重地区之专区、县成立生产救灾委员会，吸收有关部门参加，统一领导救灾工作。克服群众之单纯等待救济的依赖思想，号召组织起来，生产自救，各级政府则应认真帮助其找到生产门路。至救济粮款之发给，必须通过生产，以达救济目的；且为数有限，亦唯有通过生产，始能发挥救济效能。因此，粮款之发放，首先应采以工代赈方式，如组织灾民修渠、修路、挖沟、整滩等；或调剂战勤，如组织灾民运粮赚脚费等；其次，应有重点，不可平均使用，对于受灾严重之村庄，应尽先发放；发放对象，应为贫苦劳动阶层之人民，凡受灾最严重之贫苦烈、军、工属及勤劳贫苦农民，应优先救济。
    最后，指示指出过去各地发放救济粮，流弊甚多，如有的干部不明了制度，或怕麻烦，随意开支，或漫无标准，不照顾全局；有的干部存在恩赐观点，平均主义思想；有的干部单纯依赖政府救济，不注意组织群众互助，减低了群众间的互助互济力量；甚至有的干部讲私人情面，违反救济原则等等。指示希望各地今后对救济粮之发放，要严格注意，以求物尽其用，不致浪费。
