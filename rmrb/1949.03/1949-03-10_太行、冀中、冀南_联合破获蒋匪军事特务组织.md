　　Taihang, Jizhong, and Jinan
  　Jointly Cracked a Chiang Kai-shek Bandit Military Special Agent Organization
    The "Underground Army" 16th Division, 2nd Battalion, organized by the Kuomintang Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, was completely captured on January 17th after half a year of meticulous secret investigation by us. A total of six people were arrested, including Bai Yanling (also known as Bai Junling), the instructor of the 2nd Battalion Headquarters, and the heads of the three companies under his command. At the same time, three stations were uncovered, namely Gaoyi Station, Lincheng Town Station, and Neiqiu Station. These three stations were responsible for traffic liaison and forwarding intelligence, with each station having two or three people. The cracking of this case involved simultaneous arrests in Lincheng, Gaoyi, Yuanshi, and Neiqiu in Taihang, Zhao County in Jizhong, and Yao and Baixiang Counties in Jinan. After completing the arrest mission, the prisoners were separately escorted for trial. This organization was established in 1946 by Liu Yannian (former Kuomintang secretary-general of Longping before the incident, a native of Gongzicun, Longyao) under the name of "Huahua Dao." In February 1947, it was renamed "District," with three supply offices: the first supply office was responsible for liaison; the second supply office was responsible for sabotage; and the third supply office was responsible for preservation and relief. In April and May 1948, the Second Battalion was formally established, taking advantage of the relatively weak work in the triangular zone of Taihang, Jinan, and Jizhong to develop. The battalion headquarters had a battalion commander, a deputy battalion commander, and an instructor. In addition, there was an inspection room (currently with three people). The battalion had three companies, each with a company commander, a deputy company commander, and an instructor. The first company had 100 people, the second company had 103 people, and the third company had 89 people. Each company had three platoons, and each platoon was divided into three squads (teams). Their method of operation was to frequently use running a business as a cover to carry out assassinations, highway robbery, or nighttime looting. In May 1948, they robbed the Shanxingcheng tobacco shop in Xingtai; on May 13th, they killed a communication soldier from our Military and Political University and seized a Type 99 rifle; in July, Comrade Hao of Baixiang Lihua Store was robbed and killed, and a bicycle was stolen; in July, Niu Fan Li Qingxiu from Dataifu Village, Xingtai, was killed in Yage; and they constantly destroyed telephone wires (now more than 30 kilograms of telephone wires have been handed over). There were many similar cases. After the case was cracked, the local people were extremely excited. The case is currently being thoroughly tried in various places.
