(Hebei-Shandong-Henan Border Region Dispatch) The Hebei-Shandong-Henan Border Region Cultural Association recently held a drama symposium to study the issue of reforming old operas. Representatives from ten professional opera troupes, including Minyi, two rural opera troupes, and organizations such as the Art League, Cultural Work Troupe, Pingyuan Society, and bookstore editorial departments, totaling twenty people, attended. The Propaganda Department of the Regional Party Committee also sent personnel to provide guidance. At the meeting, discussions and deliberations were conducted in groups based on different opera styles such as Gao Diao, Ping Diao, Si Xian, Bangzi Opera, and Hengdi Bangzi. Erroneous thoughts were criticized, such as the idea that reviewing plays constitutes "lack of freedom," adopting a "perfunctory" attitude towards staging new plays, and attempting to rely solely on the leadership to solve the problems of selling tickets and livelihood. On the afternoon of the 7th, Wang Yaping of the Cultural Association made a concluding speech, pointing out that all opera troupes active in our region must be under the leadership of the government and the Cultural Association. The Cultural Association is responsible for political thought and professional leadership for all cultural and artistic activities in the region. All opera troupes must obey the leadership, abide by the approved programs, and gradually stage new plays. The old-fashioned troupe leader system and unreasonable profit-sharing system should be gradually reformed under necessary and possible conditions, to give play to the spirit of democratic centralism and raise the ideological awareness of the actors.

    冀鲁豫开座谈会
    【冀鲁豫电】冀鲁豫文协近召开戏剧座谈会，研究旧剧改革问题。到民艺等十个职业剧社、两个农村剧团，及艺联、文工团、平原社、书店编辑部等机关团体代表共二十人，区党委宣传部并派员出席指导。会上按高调、平调、四弦、梆子戏、横笛梆子等不同调门分组酝酿讨论。批判了认为审查剧目便“不自由”，对排演新剧采取“应付公事”态度，企图单纯依靠领导上解决卖戏和生活问题等错误思想。七日下午，由文协王亚平作总结，指出：刻在我区活动的剧团都要受政府和文协领导，文协对全区的各种文艺活动，要负政治思想及业务上领导的责任，各剧社必须服从领导，遵守准演节目，逐步排演新剧。老一套的掌班制度，不合理的分红制度，在必要与可能的条件下，逐步加以改革，发挥民主集中的领导精神，提高演员的思想自觉。
