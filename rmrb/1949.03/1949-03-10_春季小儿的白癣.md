Ringworm in Children in Spring

Symptoms: The shape is round, grayish-white, and the surface has bran-like scales. The boundary between the surrounding area and the healthy skin is clear. The number of affected areas ranges from one or two to ten or so, and they are slightly itchy. If it grows in the hair, the hair will become sparse, brittle, and easily broken. This disease is most common in boys, especially during school age.

Treatment and Prevention

One, keep the affected area clean and wash it frequently with warm water.

Two, do not scratch or touch to prevent the spread and migration of the affected area. Cover the affected area (apply ointment or use gauze).

Three, apply ointment. After washing with warm water or soap, it is generally effective to apply Dadsulph ointment or 5% salicylic acid alcohol.

Four, local remedies: (1) Rub with ginger slices. (2) Mix lead powder (rouge with high lead content) with black oil (hair oil) to form a paste and apply.
