Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 5th: Soviet newspapers have successively published editorials explaining the great significance of the new price reductions for consumer goods in state-owned retail trade. According to TASS: The editorial in *Pravda* stated: This new price reduction is based on the further improvement of the Soviet post-war economy. This once again makes the limitless benefits of the socialist system clear to the world and shows that the socialist system is incomparably better than the corrupt capitalist system. The editorial in *Trud* pointed out that while the welfare of the working people in Soviet cities and countryside is constantly improving, the situation in capitalist countries is very different. There, currency is increasingly inflated and devalued, consumer prices are constantly rising, and unemployment is rapidly increasing. These signs indicate that the working people in capitalist countries are becoming poorer day by day. The suffering of the working people is particularly great in Western European countries burdened by the "Marshall Plan." The number of unemployed people and their families in Western European countries now exceeds 25 million. As a pillar of capitalism, the United States is also facing an economic crisis, and the number of bankruptcies and closures of enterprises is increasing day by day, and the number of unemployed people is also increasing rapidly, and this mass unemployment is becoming increasingly widespread. These are ominous signs of an approaching economic crisis.

　　苏联战后经济进一步提高
    社会主义制度福利无穷
    苏报评论消费品减价伟大意义
    【新华社陕北五日电】苏联各报纷纷发表社论，说明国营零售贸易中消费品新减价的伟大意义。据塔斯社讯：真理报的社论称：这次新的减价，是在苏联战后经济进一步提高了的基础上实现的。这件事再一次让全世界清楚地看到社会主义制度无穷的利益，并说明社会主义制度比腐朽的资本主义制度，是好得无法比较的。劳动报的社论指出，当苏联城乡劳动人民的福利不断提高之时，资本主义国家的情况则十分不同。在那里，通货日益膨胀、贬值，消费品价格不断上涨，失业迅速增加，这些标志着资本主义国家劳动人民一天比一天地贫困化。在担负着“马歇尔计划”重荷的西欧各国中，劳动人民所遭受的困苦特别大。西欧各国的失业者和他们的家属，现在已经超过了二千五百万人。作为资本主义台柱的美国，经济危机也正无情地迫近，企业破产与倒闭的数目，正日益增加，失业的人数也在迅速增加，而且，这种失业的群众性正越来越大了。这些正是经济危机迫近的凶兆。
