Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 18th: TASS Moscow dispatch: The "Pravda" published an open letter from Varga on the 15th. The letter stated: Vicious anti-communist organs, radio broadcasts and magazines of new world war instigators, have recently spread all kinds of slanderous messages about me, saying that I am a person "leaning towards the West," a "supporter" of the Marshall Plan, and that I deny the possibility of overproduction crisis in the United States, and other similar fabrications.

Systematically spreading various fabricated rumors is a component part of the ideological preparation for a new war. Western warmongers are imitating the example of Hitler and Goebbels. The German fascist warmongers were accustomed to loudly proclaiming that once the war broke out, the Soviet peasants and non-Russians would stand on their side against the Soviet Union. The Second World War has proved the absurdity of fascist propaganda, proved the spiritual and political unity of all the Soviet people and their patriotism and heroism in defending the socialist motherland.

The new Anglo-American warmongers are actually repeating the stupid propaganda of the German fascist war instigators. They know that the politically conscious workers in their own countries resolutely oppose the war against socialist countries, and that these workers are ready, once a war breaks out for the benefit of the exploiters, to rise up and regard the Soviet army as the liberator who will free them from the shackles of the financial oligarchy, and to help the Soviet army. The new Anglo-American warmongers know that the bourgeois groups themselves are afraid of the material and ideological strength of the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries.

In order to deceive the people in their own countries, they imitate Hitler's "blitzkrieg" example and claim to be able to conquer the Soviet Union with atomic bombs alone.

They try to portray every scientific discussion in the Soviet Union as a struggle of hostile forces, and falsely assert that they have certain supporters in our country. They use the same method to slander me. But their slanderous assertions are full of loopholes. I have never supported the Marshall Plan. In the Soviet Union, I was the first scientist to publicly oppose the Marshall Plan. (See my booklet: "The Marshall Plan and Anglo-American Economy," a record of the speech on August 27, 1947). And I have never said that the United States in general or in 1949 did not have a crisis of overproduction. On the contrary, in an article published in "Pravda" in 1946, I predicted, based on an analysis of specific materials on the American economy, that the crisis of overproduction in the United States would begin no later than 1948, which has obviously proved to be correct.

The warmongers say that I am a person "leaning towards the West." I want to lodge the strongest protest against this despicable fabrication. In the current historical situation, "leaning towards the West" is tantamount to being counter-revolutionary, anti-Soviet, and betraying the working class.

I ask the editorial board to publish this letter of mine, so that the workers abroad and all honest people will not doubt my attitude under the influence of the slanderous propaganda carried out by the enemies of the working class and the instigators of new wars.

### 瓦尔加发表公开信　严斥战贩无耻诽谤

　　瓦尔加发表公开信
  　严斥战贩无耻诽谤
    【新华社陕北十八日电】塔斯社莫斯科讯：真理报于十五日发表瓦尔加的一封公开信。该信称：凶恶的反动机关报、新的世界战争挑拨者的无线电广播和杂志，最近散布了各色各样诽谤我的消息，据他们说，我是“朝向西方”的人，是马歇尔计划的“拥护者”，他们说我否认美国有生产过剩危机的可能性，还有其他类似的捏造的谰言。
    有系统的散布各种虚构的谣言，这是进行新战争的思想准备的一个构成部份。西方战争贩子模仿希特勒和戈培尔的榜样。德国法西斯战争贩子惯于大声嚎叫说，一旦战争暴发，苏联的农民和非俄罗斯人将站在他们方面反对苏联。第二次世界大战已证明了法西斯宣传的荒诞无稽，证明了苏联全体人民精神上政治上的团结和他们在捍卫社会主义祖国的爱国主义和英雄主义。
    新的英美战争贩子实际上是在重复着德国法西斯战争挑拨者的愚蠢的宣传。他们知道：他们国内的政治上已经觉悟了的工人们坚决反对对社会主义国家的战争，而且这些工人们已经准备着一旦爆发了剥削者借以谋利的战争，他们就起来，把苏军看作是将他们从财政寡头桎梏下解脱出来的解放者，来帮助苏军。新的英美战争贩子们知道资产阶级集团本身是害怕苏联与人民民主国家的物质力量与思想力量的。
    为了愚弄他们国内的人民，他们模仿希特勒“闪电战”的榜样，自命能够从这方仅用原子弹就能征服得了苏联。
    他们力图把苏联的每一次科学讨论都说成是敌对力量的斗争，并且虚妄地断言他们在我们国家里有某些支持者。他们用同样的方法来诽谤我。但是他们的诽谤断言是有漏洞的。我从未赞成过马歇尔计划。在苏联，我是第一个出来公开反对马歇尔计划的科学家。（请看我的小册子：“马歇尔计划与英美经济”，一九四七年八月二十七日讲演的纪录）。而我从来也没有说过美国一般的或在一九四九年不曾有生产过剩的危机。恰恰相反，在一九四六年，在真理报上发表的文章里面，我曾根据对美国经济具体材料的分析，预言美国生产过剩的危机之开始，将不会迟于一九四八年，这显然证明了是正确的。
    战争贩子们说我是“朝向西方”的人，我要对这一卑污的捏造提出最坚决的抗议。在目前历史情势下，“朝向西方”无异是反革命、反苏、背叛工人阶级。
    我请编辑委员会发表我这封信，以使国外的工人们和一切诚实的人民，在工人阶级的敌人、新战争挑拨者所进行的诽谤宣传的影响下，不曾怀疑我的态度。
