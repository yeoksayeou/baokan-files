[Jidong Electric] The entire Baodi County has now sown over 113,000 mu of spring wheat, exceeding half of the planned sowing area (200,000 mu). Thanks to the government's timely assistance in solving the difficulties faced by farmers, such as shortages of seeds, manpower, and animal power, coupled with the rapid receding of waterlogging in low-lying areas since the beginning of spring, freeing up a large amount of wheat land, it is expected that not only can the wheat planting plan be guaranteed, but it may also be exceeded. For example, the Thirteenth District has now sown 20,000 mu, completing this year's planned target and is estimated to be able to increase planting by another 9,000 mu. The Eleventh District originally planned to plant 42,000 mu and has now completed 26,000 mu. In addition to ensuring the completion of the plan, it can also increase planting by 2,500 mu. In the tense wheat planting campaign, the broad masses of women participate in various main labors just like men. In Damizhuang Village in the Eleventh District, most of the 200-plus women in the village participated in wheat planting.

　　广大妇女参加主要劳动
    宝坻种麦十一万亩
  　预定计划已超过一半
    【冀东电】宝坻全县现已种上春麦十一万三千余亩，达到预订播种亩数（二十万亩）一半以上。由于政府及时帮助农民解决了种籽及人、畜力缺乏等困难，加以开春以来洼地积水迅速退落，脱出了大量麦地，预料不但可以保证完成种麦计划，并且还可能超过。如十三区现已播种二万亩，已完成今年预定计划，估计还能增种九千亩。十一区原计划种四万二千亩，现已种完两万六千亩。除保证完成计划外，还可增种二千五百亩。在紧张的种麦运动中，广大妇女和男子一样参加各种主要劳动。十一区大米庄全村二百多名妇女大都参加了种麦。
