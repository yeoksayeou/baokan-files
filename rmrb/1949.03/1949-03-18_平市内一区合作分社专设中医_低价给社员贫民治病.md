　　First District Cooperative Branch in Ping City Establishes Traditional Chinese Medicine Department
  　Providing Low-Cost Medical Treatment for Members and the Poor
    [Our Newspaper's Report] The First District Cooperative Branch in Ping City has established a Traditional Chinese Medicine department, dedicated to serving impoverished members and citizens. It began providing treatment on March 1st, specializing in illnesses affecting children, women, and tuberculosis. To alleviate the financial burden on members and impoverished citizens, the registration fee for members is set at 15 yuan, and 30 yuan for non-members. Those who are extremely impoverished can receive free treatment with an introduction from the district work group. From the start of treatment to the 15th, the clinic has treated and made house calls for more than 60 people, with 24 people receiving free treatment through district introductions, all of whom have been cured. This has garnered unanimous support and praise from members and citizens. They said, "In the past, poor people had to spend 100 to 150 yuan for a registration fee to see a doctor elsewhere, but here, it only costs 15 or 30 yuan. The money saved can be used to buy medicine." (Zhao Gang)
