　　Shijiazhuang Old Opera and Acrobatics
    Propaganda Competition Awards
    [Shijiazhuang News] The Shijiazhuang City old opera circles and acrobatic performers held a joint Spring Festival competition to deeply promote to the masses using old forms, and awards were given on the 8th. This competition featured 25 remodeled and original programs. During the evaluation on the 24th of last month, reviews were conducted from the scripts to the individual performers. Everyone unanimously agreed that during this performance, artists from the entire city observed and learned from each other, and everyone was very united, overcoming the bad habits of the old society where "big troupes looked down on small troupes, and small troupes looked down on street performers." At the awards ceremony, the director of the Shijiazhuang City Drama Work Committee pointed out that the Spring Festival competition made the old opera circles and artists realize the importance of rehearsing new plays, laying the foundation for future reforms of old opera. The shortcomings were that it failed to better integrate with current political tasks, and there were too few programs reflecting the lives of the people in the city. He called on the city's artists to further strengthen their learning, raise their awareness, and better serve the people. The award winners included: Wang Zhenshan from the Shijiazhuang Innovation Opera Troupe, Li Baosheng from the Yihe Ping Opera Troupe, Liu Kuixue from the Longshunhe String Band, and Zhang Yongxi from the Acrobatics Hall.
