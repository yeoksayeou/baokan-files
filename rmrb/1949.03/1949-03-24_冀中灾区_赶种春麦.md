Central Hebei Disaster Areas
    Rush to Plant Spring Wheat
    [Jizhong Electric] Farmers in the waterlogged areas of Wen'an, Gaoyang, Renqiu, Jinghai, Jin, Ba, and Xian counties in central Hebei are currently rushing to plant spring wheat and barley. According to statistics from seventy-six waterlogged villages in Xian and Wen'an counties alone, 4,087 mu of spring wheat and barley have already been sown. During the planting, most disaster-stricken villages have mobilized their full and semi-labor forces to carry out a concentrated rush to plant. Cadres of districts and villages in Jinghai's eighth district led and organized mutual aid teams; thirty-six Party members from six villages led 364 households, organizing 65 mutual aid teams, and sowing 1,220 mu of spring wheat in three days. In Xian County, Wanjiazhai and eight other villages, under the slogan of "sowing one day earlier means harvesting ten days earlier," farmers across the villages actively rushed to transport fertilizer, harrow the land, and sow wheat; some villages organized mutual aid teams, planting each plot as soon as it was cleared of water. In five days, the eight villages planted 1,690 mu of wheat.
