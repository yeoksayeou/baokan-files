A Story of a Russian Woman (Continued from Yesterday)
    By Yelena Kononenko
    Translated from "Pravda" by Jun Qiang
    Olga Ivanovna, the worker from the local committee, learned about this. She thought about what might happen. At dusk, she came to the "Lenin Road" and talked with the peasant women. In the evening, she stayed at Anna's house, and in the morning, they both went to the fields. During the war, the Agulina group had received five terrible notices of misfortune, one of which was for Agulina herself – her son Vanya died from a severe abdominal injury.
    Agulina lay unconscious for two hours. Later, in a way that frightened the women, she found a newly made shirt of Vanya's from the box and held it tightly to her chest. She sat like that on the floor next to the box until late at night. The group was supposed to be stacking grain at night. Maria, the deputy leader of the group, came and sat next to her on the floor, saying, "Agulina, we are going to work. Don't worry, I will lead the group. You lie down and rest, please, we beg you." Agulina hid Vanya's shirt in the box, stood up, and said, "I'm going too, Masha, it will be easier that way!" After washing her face with cold water, she went to the field. It was a bright moonlit night. There was no color in Agulina's face. They worked for a long time in silence. In the morning, everyone was harvesting rice, and Agulina joined in. During the breakfast break, the female teacher Sidorina came and reported to everyone the news of the Red Army's victory on the front lines. The women were happy, and the children shouted "Long live the Red Army!" "Long live Stalin!" Agulina straightened up and said, "This is not the end! Let them suffer more blows, the cursed Fascist bandits! They dream of destroying us – try it. No, you don't understand Soviet Russia!" After Agulina finished speaking, she picked up her sickle again and continued to work enthusiastically, as if she were using the sickle to cut off the heads of the enemies. The old team leader saw this scene and said to the old man mowing the grass, "Where did they get so much strength from!"
    The "Lenin Road" farm sent out more than the planned amount of military grain more than once. Agulina was always on the first cart, holding the flag that said "Grain – to the front lines!" Even the horse's collar was painted with "Kill Hitler!"

    (III)
    After the victory against Fascist Germany, Stepan returned. He was not injured, but his temples had turned gray.
    Agulina was sitting there studying agricultural techniques with everyone when Lida ran into the reading room, shouting, "Dad is back, Dad is back!" Just like sad news, happiness can also paralyze people. Agulina couldn't stand up immediately or say a word. "Forgive us!" she whispered and ran towards the door.
    How much they had to talk about those nights!
    Stepan already understood that Agulina had changed a lot. Once he said, "It seems you won't abandon the group again, will you?" "No, Stepan, not now." "Can't you rest without the group?" "No, I can't leave it now," Agulina repeated, "You don't have to worry about things at home. Masha already knows how to walk, and Lida can help now too."
    The spring of 1947 was a difficult spring. The drought of 1946 brought poverty. The government helped with seeds and grain, but there was still not enough bread.
    If Agulina and the other women could endure these difficulties, could work so bravely in the fields, not succumb, and even consider all of this their duty in their souls, it was because they were true Soviet patriots.
    Their duty was to harvest at least 20 centners of rye per hectare, but on eight hectares, they had to harvest an average of 30 centners.
    The women went to the fields to store snow. They fought with the snowdrifts for five days, trying to store the snow to irrigate the fields. The snow was dry and loose, and when the wind blew, it all blew away. The group wasted a lot of effort.
    When it was about to get warmer, the wind stopped, and the snowfall became heavier. Agulina's group set off again to fight with the snow. This time, they piled the snow higher and more firmly. When the wind blew, the snow was preserved. They were very happy... In that eight-hectare area, "snow storage" was carried out three times. Fatigue and cold did not discourage them. In the end, they were victorious. Snow storage allowed them to harvest an additional four centners of surplus grain per hectare.
    When the snow began to melt, Agulina led her group to irrigate the fields with snow water. The rye turned green.
    The days were very tense because the group managed not only rye but also sugar beets. They had to succeed in everything. Agulina was very clear about the abilities of everyone in the group, so she was able to allocate strength skillfully.
    Clear, beautiful, windless days arrived. Although these silent days were happy during labor, they alarmed the group. They understood that windless weather was not good for crops that were flowering and needed pollination.
    "Let's spread pollen, it's better than this ghostly silence. What educated people write in books cannot be lies..."
    "People will laugh at us," Maria said hesitantly.
    "Let them laugh, Masha, this matter is really troublesome!"
    The group decided to pollinate the rye. They braided a long rope and took it to the fields at dawn. Masha and Anna walked on the ridges, pulling one end of the rope, and the rest of the women spread out, holding the rope in their hands and gently tapping the ears of rye. The ears of wheat tilted and collided, and thus the pollen was spread.
    "Good! Good!" Agulina encouraged them, "Hold the rope, hold it... The rye is all swaying."
    The rye flowers bloomed for ten days, and the artificial pollination work resulted in an additional four to five centners of rye per hectare.

    (IV)
    Ah, harvest! Harvest the sugar beets! Try not to lose a single cob! The mature, tall rye swayed like a green wave, the ears were heavy, full, and complete. How could we not try our best to preserve these grains! Especially when they are so needed to improve people's lives!
    How eagerly they were waiting for the total harvest! The amount that the Agulina group collected on the field was: an average of twenty centners per hectare on twenty-three hectares, but on that eight-hectare land, they collected an average of thirty-three centners.
    When collecting sugar beets, the Agulina group spent twenty-four days and nights in the fields, living in newly built huts. They dug sugar beets during the day and cleaned them under the moonlight at night. When there was no moon, they worked with the lights on.
    The Agulina group harvested 459 centners of sugar beets per hectare. After giving it to the state, each woman in the group received 26 poods of white sugar and 1,800 rubles.
    In this way, Agulina became a Hero of Socialist Labor, and the members of the group were also awarded medals.
    This year, Agulina and her group have set new production plans for themselves: at least 35 centners of rye and 600 centners of sugar beets per hectare.
    Soviet people, comrades! We should remember the heroic rural woman Agulina and her glorious girlfriends! Remember the great strength of our collective farm women – pay them deep respect.
    "Note": "Hectare" is 10,000 square meters. "Centner" is 100 pounds.

　　一个俄罗斯女人的故事　（续昨）
    耶林娜科诺宁克著
    君强译自“真理报”
    奥里加·依万诺夫娜那个地委会的工作者知道了这件事。她想到可能发生什么事情。黄昏时她来到“列宁之路”同农妇们谈话，晚上就住在安娜家里，早晨都到田里去了，安娜也去了。在战争期间，阿古林娜小组接到过五件可怕的不幸的通知，其中之一是给阿古林娜自己的——儿子瓦尼由于腹部重伤死去了。
    阿古林娜无知觉地躺了两小时，后来是那样奇怪，把女人们都吓住了，她从箱子中找出一件新做的瓦尼的衬衣，紧紧拥在自己胸前，就这样坐在箱子旁边的地板上直到深夜，夜里小组还应该去堆禾，小组的副组长玛丽亚来了，和她并排坐在地板上说：“阿古林娜，我们去工作了。你不用挂念着，我会领导小组的，你躺下休息休息，躺下，我们请求你。”阿古林娜把瓦尼的衬衣藏在箱子里，站起来说：“我也去，玛沙，这样轻快些！”用冷水洗过脸，到田地去了，是一个明朗的月夜，阿古林娜脸上没有一点血色，她们长久而沉默地工作着。早晨大家割稻，阿古林娜也参加了，在早饭的休息期间，女教师西多林娜来了，报告给大家前线红军胜利的消息。女人们都快乐起来，孩子们大喊“红军万岁！”“斯大林万岁！”阿古林娜站直了身子说：“这还不算完呢！让他们多受些打击吧，可咀咒的法西斯蒂匪徒们！他们梦想毁灭我们——试试看。不，你们不了解苏维埃的俄罗斯！”阿古林娜说完又拿起镰刀继续热心的工作。好象在用镰刀割敌人的头颅似的。队长老头子看见这种情形向刈草的老头说：“她们从哪儿来的那么大劲呀！”
    “列宁之路”农场不只一次的送出去超过计划的军粮。阿古林娜总是在第一辆荷车上。举着“粮食——往前线去！”的旗子。甚至在马的颈圈上都涂上“打死希特勒！”
    　　　　（三）
    对法西斯德国战争胜利后，斯契潘回来了。他没有受伤，只是两鬓添了白发。
    阿古林娜正坐在那里和大家研究农业技术，丽达笑着跑进读书室来喊：“爸爸回来了，爸爸回来了！”和悲苦的消息一样，快乐也可使人麻痹，阿古林娜不能立刻站起来，也说不出一句话，“原谅我们！”她小声说：跑向门口去了。
    那几夜里有多少谈不完的话啊！
    司契潘已经明白阿古林娜有了很大的变化，一次他说：“看起来，你不会再丢弃小组的吧？”“不会，司契潘，现在不能够了。”“没有小组你不是可以休息休息吗？”“不，现在我离不了它，”阿古林娜又重复着：“家里的事你不用挂心，玛沙已经会走了，况且丽达现在也能帮忙了。”
    一九四七年的春天是一个沉重的春天。四六年的旱灾带来了穷困，政府帮助种子和粮食，但是面包却还是不够。
    如果，阿古林娜和别的女人们能忍受这些困难，能那样英勇地在田地工作，不屈服，甚至在灵魂上都把这一切认为自己的义务，她们所以能这样，就因为她们是真正的苏维埃的爱国者。
    她们的义务是这样，从每“哥克塔尔”平均要至少收获二十兹特涅尔裸麦，可是在“八哥克塔尔”却平均要收获三十兹特涅尔。
    女人们到田野去储雪，她们和雪堆斗争了五天，想把雪储起来准备灌溉田地，雪是干散的，大风吹起时，都刮跑了，小组白费了很多力。
    天快要暖和时，风止了，降雪隙更大，阿古林娜小组又出发去和雪斗争。这次把雪堆得更高，更结实些，风吹起时，雪保存下了，她们非常高兴……在那“八哥克塔尔”耕区，“储雪”就进行了三次，疲乏，受冻都不曾使他们灰心。最后胜利了，储雪使她们在每哥克塔尔多收获了四兹特涅尔的剩余粮食。
    当雪开始融化时，阿古林娜领导自己的小组，用雪水灌溉田地，裸麦绿了。
    日子过得是非常紧张的，因为小组管理的不只裸麦，还有甜菜，无论在哪方面都应该成功的。阿古林娜对于小组中每个人的能力都很清楚，所以能够精妙的配置力量。
    晴朗美好无风的日子来临了，这种寂静的日子，虽然劳动时是幸福的，但却又惊起了小组，她们明白没有风的天气，对于开着花正需受粉的农作物却是不妥当的。
    “让我们去传播花粉去，总比这鬼也不响一声的静着好，有学问的人们，在书上写的总不会是谎话的……”
    “人们会笑话我们的。”玛丽亚犹疑着说。
    “让他们笑去，玛沙，这件事真麻烦！”
    小组决定了给裸麦传播花粉，她们编了一个长绳索，拂晓时就拿着到田里去了。玛沙和安娜在垄上走，拉着绳索的一端，其余的女人们都散开，用手拿着绳子轻轻叩打裸麦的穗，麦穗倾斜互撞，于是就传播了花粉。
    “好！好！”阿古林娜鼓励她们说：“拉住绳子，拉住了……裸麦都幌起来了。”
    裸麦的花开放了十天，人工的播粉工作使每哥克塔尔又多收获了四——五兹特涅尔的裸麦。
    　　　　（四）
    啊，收获！收获甜菜！尽量地不遗失一个穗！成熟的高大的裸麦象一片绿波似的闪动，穗是沉重、丰满、完整的，怎么能不尽力保存这些谷物呢！尤其在改善人民生活上，它们是这样需要的时候！
    是怎样在期待着收获的总量啊！阿古林娜小组收集在场上的数目是：在二十三哥克塔尔里平均每哥克塔尔收获了二十兹特涅尔，可是在那“八哥克塔尔”地郤平均收集了三十三兹特涅尔。
    收集甜菜时，阿古林娜小组曾在田野里过了二十四昼夜。住在新架起的小屋里。白天掘甜菜，夜晚在月光下清理，没有月亮的时候就点着灯工作。
    阿古林娜小组在每哥克塔尔收获了四百五十九兹特涅尔甜菜。在给了国家以后，小组的每个女人都分到了二十六朴特白糖和一千八百卢布。
    这样，阿古林娜就成为社会主义劳动英雄，小组的组员也都得到了勋章。
    今年阿古林娜和她的小组又给自己规定了新的生产计划，每哥克塔尔至少要收三十五兹特涅尔裸麦，六百兹特涅尔甜菜。
    苏维埃人民，同志们！我们应该记住乡村妇女阿古林娜女英雄和她的光荣的女友们！记住我们集体农场妇女们的伟大的力量——向她们致深深的敬礼。
    “注”：“哥克塔尔”为一万平方米。“兹特涅尔”为一百磅。
