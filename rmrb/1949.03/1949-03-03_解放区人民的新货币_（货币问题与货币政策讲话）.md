　　New Currency for the People in the Liberated Areas
 　（Speech on Currency Issues and Monetary Policy）
   Currently, various currencies are in circulation in the liberated areas, most of which originated during the Anti-Japanese War. At that time, the Kuomintang reactionaries and the puppet governments under Japanese rule all implemented reactionary fiscal and economic policies, indiscriminately issuing Chiang Kai-shek's currency and Wang Jingwei's currency. The value of Chiang and Wang currencies depreciated rapidly, and prices soared, causing huge losses to those who held them! At the same time, they dumped Chiang and Wang currencies into our liberated areas to absorb our various valuable resources. Chiang and Wang currencies flowed inward, while valuable resources such as grain and cotton flowed outward, causing even greater losses to the people in our liberated areas! Moreover, soaring prices led to market chaos, production stagnation, and no guarantee of people's livelihoods. In order to protect the people's wealth and economic development, the democratic governments of the liberated areas had no choice but to issue their own currencies, thereby expelling Chiang and Wang currencies and establishing an independent and autonomous new currency system.

    Our new currency was born in such a special environment. Our liberated areas were divided and blockaded by the enemy, forcing us to carry out decentralized guerrilla warfare. Economically, we could only be independent, self-sufficient, and self-reliant. There was little economic connection between the liberated areas. Therefore, the currencies of the liberated areas could only be issued regionally and could not be mutually issued. This did not cause any inconvenience at the time. However, after Japan's surrender, due to the rapid expansion of the liberated areas and their gradual connection, economic exchanges became increasingly frequent. At this time, the lack of currency unification gradually became an obstacle to the exchange of materials and economic development. Thus, we had to start the work of currency unification. For example, the Central China Liberated Area completely recovered five or six different local currencies and reissued the unified Central China currency. Shandong also unified the Beihai currency, which was originally circulated separately, and allowed it to circulate freely throughout the province. Other liberated areas also had similar measures.

    Another feature of the birth of the new currency was that we were then in remote rural areas. We had no gold or silver, and the people did not need gold or silver. What they needed were living materials such as grain, cloth, and cotton. Therefore, the new currency was not linked to gold and silver from the beginning, but used important materials such as grain, cloth, and cotton as a guarantee. At that time, Chiang's and puppet currencies were rapidly declining, and we had to break away from them. We had no connection with other foreign currencies, and were completely independent and autonomous. So what did our new currency use as a standard? We used prices as a standard, striving to maintain price stability. The democratic government carefully controlled the amount of new currency issued. At the same time, it controlled important materials such as grain, cloth, and cotton as issue reserves to regulate prices and the amount of currency in circulation at any time. The democratic government guaranteed that any people holding new currency in the liberated areas could exchange their currency for various important materials needed for their lives anytime and anywhere, without the need for price limits or panic buying. The new currency protected the interests of the broad masses of people in the liberated areas, and thus won the support of the broad masses of people in the liberated areas.

    After Japan's surrender, Chiang's currency continued to inflate. Due to Chiang Kai-shek's launching of a reactionary civil war, the financial and economic situation in the Chiang-controlled areas rapidly collapsed, and prices rose faster and faster. Therefore, we had to continue to expel Chiang's currency, depreciate the exchange rate of Chiang's currency, and carry out fierce currency struggles with Chiang's currency in order to maintain the relative stability of prices in the liberated areas. Of course, in such a tense war environment, it was impossible for prices in the liberated areas to be completely stable, because the scale of the war was unprecedented, the destruction of the war was very serious, and the supply of materials could not be without difficulties. This made our prices have to rise slowly as well. However, because we adhered to correct fiscal and economic policies, were able to regulate the amount of currency issued, and adjust the supply and demand of materials to maintain a relatively stable price level. Therefore, compared with the soaring prices and miserable lives in the Chiang-controlled areas, there was a world of difference! For example, last year, prices in the Chiang-controlled areas rose by thousands of times, while prices in our liberated areas rose by only one to three times. The exchange rate between Jinan currency and Beihai currency and Chiang's currency was 1:30 in December of the year before last, but it had become 1:30,000 (legal tender) by the end of December last year. This must be said to be a huge success of our monetary policy! This year, due to the victory of the war and the development of production, prices in the liberated areas will inevitably be more stable; and Chiang's currency will completely collapse with the disintegration of the Kuomintang reactionary rule.

    Why did Chiang's currency collapse rapidly despite relying on US aid, while the currency in our liberated areas was able to be increasingly consolidated by relying entirely on our own strength? Mainly because we and Chiang Kai-shek implemented diametrically opposed fiscal and economic policies. For example, (1) we oppose imperialist economic aggression, abolish feudal exploitation, and confiscate bureaucratic capital, so as to protect the interests of the people and encourage the development of production. Due to the resolute implementation of these correct policies, our currency in the liberated areas has gained a solid economic foundation and gained the support of the broad masses of people. (2) We implement the fiscal policy of "developing the economy and guaranteeing supply," oppose corruption and waste, save money and food to guarantee war supply, and strive for a considerable balance of financial revenue and expenditure. In this way, our currency issuance can be mainly used for economic construction, and will not fall into vicious inflation due to huge financial deficits. (3) We encourage the export of local products and restrict the import of foreign goods (oppose the dumping of American and Japanese goods), and strive for a trade surplus, so that our currency struggle is always in an active position. (4) Our state-owned enterprises are always considering the interests of the people and economic development, and adopt various methods to adjust supply and demand and maintain price stability, which is essentially different from the speculation and manipulation of Kuomintang bureaucratic capital.

    In the past year, due to our great victories in military, political and economic terms, we have not only maintained a considerable stability in prices, but also partially completed the work of currency unification. During this year, several major currencies in the interior (Jinan currency, Beihai currency, Central China currency, Jin-Cha-Ji Border Region currency, Northwest Agricultural currency), except for the recently issued Zhongzhou currency, have successively announced fixed exchange rates and are mutually universal, which makes trade between the liberated areas extremely convenient. However, various currencies are complex, and the exchange rates are different, so there are still some difficulties in mutual use. Therefore, in December, the "People's Bank of China" was established, and the People's Bank issued a unified new currency. When the new currency is sufficient for market circulation, various local currencies can be gradually recovered at the statutory exchange rate. Zhongzhou currency and the Northeast currency outside the customs will also be gradually replaced by the unified new currency, so that our currency unification work will be fully completed. After currency unification, the economic life of the liberated areas will be completely integrated, which will greatly help the development of production and the prosperity of the market. And make our currency system more sound, more consolidated, and suitable for future economic development needs.

    The above sections illustrate such a problem, that is, Chiang's currency and the new currency in the liberated areas have two completely different essences, and therefore there must be two completely different futures. Chiang's currency is the product of imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism. It is an important tool for the Kuomintang reactionaries to plunder the people, so it will inevitably collapse with the collapse of the Kuomintang reactionary rule. The new currency in the liberated areas is anti-imperialist, anti-feudal, and anti-bureaucratic capitalist. It is a product of the new democratic revolution. It protects the interests of the broad masses of people and is an important guarantee for the development of the new democratic economy. Therefore, it will inevitably be increasingly consolidated with the victory of the new democratic revolution. The development of facts in recent years has fully proved that there is no room for doubt.

### 解放区人民的新货币　（货币问题与货币政策讲话）

　　解放区人民的新货币
  　（货币问题与货币政策讲话）
    目前解放区通用各种货币，大多数诞生于抗战时期，当时国民党反动派和日本统治下的傀儡政府，均实行反动的财政经济政策、滥发蒋币汪币、蒋币汪币迅速跌价，物价飞跃上涨，使持有蒋币和汪币的人都受到了极大的损失！同时他们向我解放区倾销蒋币汪币，以吸收我们的各种珍贵物资；蒋币汪币滚向内流，粮食棉花等类宝贵物资滚滚外流，我解放区的人民所受损失更大！且因物价飞涨，以致市场混乱，生产停滞，人民生活丝毫没有保障。解放区的民主政府为着保护人民财富，保护经济发展，不得不自己发行货币，进而驱逐蒋币汪币，建立独立自主的新货币制度。
    当时我们的新货币是诞生在这样一个特殊的环境中。我们各解放区被敌分割封锁，不得不进行着分散的游击战争，经济上也只能独立自主，自足自给，各解放区之间很少经济上的联系。因此各解放区的货币也只能够分区发行，不能互相发行，这在当时并无什么不便利的地方。但到日本投降以后，由于解放区的迅速扩大，各解放区逐渐联接起来，经济上的来往日益繁密，这时货币的不统一，便逐渐成为物资交流和经济发展的障碍。于是我们不得不开始进行货币统一工作，如华中解放区把五六种不同的地方货币完全收回，改发统一的华中币；山东把原来分区流通的北海币也统一起来，在全省范围内自由流通；其它各解放区也有类似的措施。
    新货币诞生时的另外一个特点，是我们当时处于偏僻的乡村，我们没有金银，人民亦不需要金银，他们需要的是粮食布棉等类生活资料，因此新货币自始即没有与金银发生联系，是用粮食布棉等类重要物资作为保证。当时蒋币伪币已在迅速没落，我们必须与它脱离关系，与其他外国货币更无丝毫瓜葛，完全独立自主。那末我们的新货币究竟是把什么来做标准的呢？我们是把物价来做标准，努力保持物价的平稳。民主政府谨慎掌握新货币的发行数量；同时掌握粮食布棉等类重要物资作为发行准备，用以随时调节物价，调节货币流通数量。民主政府保证持有解放区新货币的任何人民，能够随时随地以其货币换回他们生活所需要的各种重要物资；既不需要限价，也不需要抢购。新货币保护着解放区广大人民的利益，因而就获得了解放区广大人民的拥护。
    日本投降以后，蒋币还是继续膨帐。由于蒋匪发动反动内战，蒋区的财政经济迅速破产，物价上涨愈来愈快。因此我们必须继续驱逐蒋币，贬低蒋币比价，与蒋币进行剧烈的货币斗争，这样才能保持解放区物价的相当的平稳。当然，在这样紧张的战争环境中，解放区的物价亦不可能完全稳定，因为战争规模空前巨大，战争破坏又很严重，物资供给不能没有困难；这就使我们的物价不得不也慢慢上涨。但因我们坚持着正确的财政经济政策，能够调节货币发行数量，调剂物资供求，以保持物价的相当的平稳。因此与蒋区的物价暴涨，民不聊生比较起来，确有天渊之别！如去年全年蒋区物价上涨了一千几百倍，而我解放区的物价则仅上涨了一倍到三倍。冀南币北海币与蒋币的比价，前年十二月还是一比三十，到去年十二月底已经变为一比三万（法币）。这不能不说是我们货币政策的巨大的成功！今年由于战争胜利，生产发展，解放区的物价必然更加平稳；而蒋币则将随着国民党反动统治的瓦解而彻底崩溃。
    为什么蒋币依靠美援仍然迅速崩溃，而我解放区的货币则能完全依靠自己的力量而日益巩固呢？主要由于我们与蒋匪执行了截然相反的财政经济政策。如（一）我们反对帝国主义的经济侵略，废除封建剥削，没收官僚资本，这样来保护人民利益，然励生产发展。由于这些正确政策的坚决执行，使我们解放区的货币获得了巩固的经济基础，并获得广大人民的支持。（二）我们实行“发展经济，保障供给”的财政政策，反对贪污浪费，节衣缩食保障战争供给，并争取财政收支的相当的平衡。这样我们的货币发行便可主要用于经济建设，不致于因巨大的财政亏空而陷入恶性的通货膨帐。（三）我们奖励土产输出，限制洋货输入（反对美货日货倾销），争取贸易出超，使我们的货币斗争经常处于主动地位。（四）我们的国营企业处处为人民利益和经济发展打算，采用各种办法来调剂供求，保持物价平稳，与国民党官僚资本的投机操纵显有本质上的区别。
    去年一年由于我们军事上，政治上，经济上的巨大胜利，我们不但保持了物价的相当的平稳，而且部分地完成了货币统一工作。在这一年中间，关内几种主要货币，（冀南币，北海币，华中币，晋察冀边币，西北农币）除最近发行的中州币外，均已先后宣布固定比价，互相通用，这使各解放区之间的贸易来往感到极大的方便。但各种货币种类复杂，比价高低不同，互相通用仍有若干困难。因此到十二月间又成立“中国人民银行”，并由人民银行发行统一的新货币。到新货币已足够市场流通需要时候，即可以按法定比价逐渐收回各种地方货币，中州币及关外的东北币也将逐渐被统一的新货币所代替，使我们的货币统一工作全部完成。货币统一以后，各解放区的经济生活即将完全打成一片，这将大有助于生产的发展和市场的繁荣。且使我们的货币制度更健全，更巩固，适合今后经济发展需要。
    以上各节说明这样一个问题，即将币与解放区新货币具有着两种完全不同的本质，因而就必然有两种完全不同的前途。蒋币是帝国主义，封建主义，官僚资本主义统治的产物，它是国民党反动派掠夺人民之一重要工具，所以它必然会跟随着国民党反动统治的崩溃而崩溃。解放区新货币则是反帝国主义，反封建主义，反官僚资本主义的，新民主主义革命的产物，它保护着广大人民的利益，且系新民主主义经济发展之一重要保证，所以它必然会跟随着新民主主义革命的胜利而日益巩固。几年来事实的发展，已经完全证明，丝毫没有怀疑的余地了。
