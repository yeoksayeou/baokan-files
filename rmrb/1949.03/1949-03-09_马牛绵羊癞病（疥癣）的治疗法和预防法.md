Treatment and Prevention of Mange (Scabies) in Horses, Cattle, and Sheep

A. Mange in Horses and Cattle (Equine and Bovine Scabies)

Mange, also known as scabies, is caused by tiny scabies mites that infest livestock, causing them to become thin and weak, and unable to work effectively. If left untreated, it can lead to death. This disease is highly contagious; one animal can quickly infect the entire herd. This significantly hinders our spring plowing and production. Below are several prevention and treatment methods for mange that are feasible in rural areas:

I. Treatment Methods

(1) Tobacco Stems (veins are best, tobacco leaves can also be used, but are less economical): 0.5 to 1 jin, Water: 10 jin.

Preparation: Put 0.5 to 1 jin of tobacco stems into 10 jin of water, boil for a few minutes, then remove the stems or leaves. The temperature of the tobacco stem water should be the same as or slightly higher than the animal's body temperature when used.

Usage: First, cut the hair around the affected areas of the animal and the surrounding area. Wash it clean with soapy water, then carefully wash it again with tobacco water. It is best to use a damp, torn sack dipped in tobacco water and apply it to the affected area for 2-3 minutes. On the second and third days, reapply tobacco water or a sack dipped in tobacco water to the itchy areas. Wash again on the fourth day. Repeat this process until new hair grows back. Washing should be done on a sunny day, and the animal should be dried afterward to prevent catching a cold.

The tobacco water should kill the scabies mites in one application, but it will not kill the eggs. These will hatch into mites after three days, so repeated washing is necessary.

(2) Mothball Powder (ball-shaped ones can be ground into powder): 1 liang, Lard: 1 jin. Mix the two ingredients above thoroughly to form a paste. Apply to the shaved and cleaned mange area until fully healed. If the mange is all over the body or covers more than half of the body, do not apply it all at once (as it can interfere with the skin's excretion). Apply to the left side one day, then to the right side the next day. After two consecutive days of application, rest for three days, then repeat the application until cured.

II. Prevention Methods

(1) Healthy and diseased cattle and horses must be raised and managed separately. Especially during inter-village labor exchange, do not yoke healthy and diseased animals together.

(2) Saddles, harnesses, bridles, brushes, etc., used on animals with mange should not be used on healthy animals. If it is absolutely necessary to exchange them, items that can withstand boiling water should be boiled. Those that cannot withstand boiling can be washed clean with tobacco water before use.

(3) Regularly washing the animal's body, cleaning the stable, and providing ample grass and feed to keep the animals healthy and fat are also good ways to prevent mange.

B. Mange in Sheep (Ovine Scabies)

I. Prevention of Mange in Sheep

The prevention method is the same as for horses and cattle, but the treatment method is slightly different. Method (1) is simpler and more economical than Method (2) and can be used frequently. However, when preparing the tobacco water, do not make it too strong. Use only 4 to 5 liang of tobacco stems with 10 jin of water, boil, and filter before use. When using it, you can use a wooden bucket, large iron pot, trough, etc., to hold the tobacco water. Then soak the sheep in the tobacco water for 2-3 minutes. If the bucket is small and cannot soak the whole body at once, you can wash one side first, then turn it over and soak the other side.

II. Lime-Sulfur Emulsion

This method can both treat and prevent mange and general skin diseases in sheep.

Usage: Add a little water to 1.5 jin of quicklime to form a mud-like consistency. Then slowly add 2.5 jin of sulfur and mix thoroughly. Add 20 jin of warm water and bring to a boil. After about 3-4 hours, when a yellow-green or dark amber color develops, stop heating. Let it stand and settle, then draw off the clear liquid (discard the sediment). Add 60 jin of warm water, and use this to bathe the sheep's entire body.

III. Precautions for Sheep Dipping

(1) The temperature of the bath solution should not be too high or too low to avoid colds.

(2) When bathing, care must be taken to prevent the solution from entering the sheep's mouth, eyes, or ears to avoid poisoning.

(3) Although the weather is currently cold, you can bathe the sheep during warm, sunny afternoons. However, after washing, be sure to expose them to the sun or place them in a warm room to ensure that their wool dries quickly (drying with a towel is even better).

(4) When bathing, it is best to wash healthy sheep first, followed by sheep with mange.

(5) For disease prevention, healthy flocks should also be regularly bathed two or three times a year in spring and autumn. Sheep with mange should be washed every 7-8 days and can be cured after two or three washes. Wash in the spring after shearing and in the autumn before winter.

　　马牛绵羊癞病（疥癣）的治疗法和预防法
    甲、马牛的癞病（马牛的疥癣）
    癞病又名叫疥癣，是一种很小的疥癣虫寄生在牲口身上，使牲口一天天的瘦下去，作活又没劲儿，不治就会死去。这种病最容易传染，一头得病，很快就传染全群。这对于我们的春耕和生产，都有很大的妨碍，今将农村可能办到的几种癞病的预防法和治疗法介绍如后：
    一、治疗法
    （一）烟梗子（叶脉最好，烟叶子也行，但不经济）半斤至一斤，水十斤。
    配法：把半斤至一斤的烟梗子，放到十斤水中，煮开几分钟后，将梗子或叶子捞出使用。用时烟梗子水温度须与体温相同或略高。
    用法：先把牲口长癞地方及其附近的毛剪去，用胰子水刷洗干净，再用烟水仔细刷洗一遍，最好用破麻袋蘸湿烟水贴在患部二、三分钟。第二、第三天，还发痒的地方，再用烟水或用麻袋蘸烟水贴患部，第四天再刷洗。这样反复的作直至新毛长出来。刷洗须找晴天，洗后擦干，以免受寒。
    本来烟水一回即可把疥癣虫杀死，但杀不死虫卵，三天后又会孵化成虫，所以需要反复的洗刷。
    （二）卫生球粉末（球状的可以研成粉末使用）一两，猪油一斤，将以上二者拌匀，制成膏状，涂抹于剪毛洗净之癞部，直至全好为止。如全身或全身过半长癞时，不可全部同时涂抹（因有碍皮肤之排泄），——头一天涂抹左边，第二天则涂抹右边，连续涂抹两天后歇三天，再反复涂抹直至痊愈为止。
    二、预防法
    （一）好坏牛马，务须分别饲养管理，尤其是在插犋换工时，不可把好坏牲口套在一起。
    （二）长癞牛马用的鞍、套、笼头、刷子等，不可再给好马使用。如果万不得已必须串换使用时，能抗住开水烫的就烫，抗不住烫的可以用烟水洗刷干净，然后使用。
    （三）应该时常洗刷牲口身体，把马圈打扫干净，加草加料，使牲口肥胖，也是预防癞病的好办法。
    乙、绵羊的癞病（棉羊的疥癣）
    一、棉羊的癞病预防法
    和马牛同样，惟其治疗法则略有不同。（一）法比（二）法子简便、经济，可常用，但（一）配法制烟水时不可使之过于浓厚，只用四两到五两的烟梗子，配合水十斤煮开过滤使用。使用时可用木桶或大铁锅、水槽等盛烟水，然后把羊泡于烟水内二、三分钟，如桶小不能全身同时泡时，可先洗一面，然后翻过来再泡另一面。
    二、石灰硫黄乳剂
    本法对绵羊的癞病及一般的皮肤病既能治疗又可预防。
    用法：以生石灰一斤半加水少许，合成泥状，再缓缓加入硫黄二斤半，充分拌匀，以温水二十斤煮沸，约经三、四小时，至发生黄绿色或深琥珀色后即停止加温，静置沉淀，将清液吸出（弃去沉淀物），加入温水六十斤，以此洗浴羊的全身。
    三、绵羊药浴时的注意
    （一）洗浴药液，温度不可过高或过低，以免感冒。
    （二）洗浴时须注意药液，不得使之浸入绵羊口中和眼边、耳内，以免中毒。
    （三）现下天气虽寒，如选择日光暖和之午间，亦可洗浴。但洗后须充分晒太阳或放置温暖室内，务使其毛迅速干燥（擦干更好）。
    （四）洗浴时最好先洗健康无病之羊，后洗癞羊。
    （五）没病的羊群，为了预防癞病，亦以每年在春秋两季定期洗浴二、三次为佳。患癞病的绵羊，隔七、八天洗一回，洗二、三回即可洗好，春季洗时在剪毛后，秋季在入冬前。
