Jinnan Administrative Office Deputy Director Gao Yuangui, Handan City Mayor Yuan Chongde
Violating Discipline Subject to Punishment

[Special dispatch from this newspaper] The North China People's Government issued a circular on March 1st, regarding the dispute between Jinnan Pharmaceutical Factory and the Nitre and Sulfur General Bureau over the occupation of the former Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu Border Region Assembly's property. The decision was to give a demerit punishment to Gao Yuangui, Deputy Director of the Jinnan Administrative Office, and Yuan Chongde, Mayor of Handan City. The facts of the case are as follows: The former Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu Border Region Assembly's property, owned by the North China People's Government and entrusted to the Handan Municipal Government for management, was decided by the North China Finance and Economics Committee in October last year to be allocated to the Nitre and Sulfur General Bureau for use. The North China Government's Ministry of Finance formally issued a letter for handover. However, the Handan Municipal Government, without prior consultation and reporting to the North China Government, arbitrarily allowed the Jinnan Pharmaceutical Factory to occupy the property. When the Handan Municipal Government learned of the decision, it still allowed the Jinnan Pharmaceutical Factory to lead workers to dismantle the Assembly's auditorium. At that time, Gao Yuangui, Deputy Director of the Jinnan Administrative Office, was in Handan. He not only did not stop the Jinnan Pharmaceutical Factory's erroneous behavior, but also refused to meet with the personnel sent by the Nitre and Sulfur Bureau for negotiation several times, which led to the Nitre and Sulfur Bureau intervening in the dismantling of the auditorium and causing disputes and conflicts. Later, the North China Government decided again to order the Handan Municipal Government to hand over the property. At the same time, Wang Li, Deputy Director of the People's Supervision Institute, who was in Handan inspecting work, was ordered to investigate the matter, and the Jinnan Administrative Office and relevant parties were instructed to jointly investigate and convene a review meeting. After repeated investigations by the People's Supervision Institute, the truth was clear. The People's Supervision Institute submitted a report requesting disciplinary action for violating administrative discipline. After deliberation by the North China People's Government Committee, in order to rectify the political atmosphere, enforce political discipline, and oppose a state of anarchy and disorganization, it was decided to impose the following punishments on Deputy Director Gao Yuangui and others:

　　1. Gao Yuangui, Deputy Director of the Jinnan Administrative Office, failed to stop the pharmaceutical factory from demolishing the building and refused to meet with the Nitre and Sulfur Bureau personnel for consultation, which clearly showed a deliberate defiance of orders from higher authorities, leading to disputes. He should bear administrative responsibility. It was decided to give him a demerit punishment for violating administrative discipline.

　　2. Yuan Chongde, Mayor of the Handan Municipal Government, was entrusted by the government to manage the property. However, when dealing with the entrusted property, he neither requested instructions in advance nor reported the facts truthfully afterward, intentionally ignoring the government's decision and evading responsibility. It was also decided to give him a demerit punishment.

　　3. Yang Shaoxian, Director of the Jinnan Pharmaceutical Factory, harbored the erroneous idea of seizing local property. After the instructions from the Ministry of Finance arrived, he rushed to move in and started demolishing the auditorium. When the Nitre and Sulfur Bureau intervened, he did not hesitate to cause disputes and forcibly carried out the relocation and demolition, completely disregarding the business interests of the two merchants renting the Assembly's site and the political impact among the broad masses of the people. This kind of land-grabbing behavior is highly inappropriate. His one-sided subjective thinking method and the means of handling problems with serious localism, although executing orders from his direct superiors, should also be strictly educated. The punishment is temporarily waived, and he is ordered to deeply reflect.

　　4. Wang Pengfei, Director of the Nitre and Sulfur Factory, initially followed the government's order to seek solutions through consultation. However, when the pharmaceutical factory moved in, he failed to calmly consider the problem and wait for the government to resolve it. Instead, he acted rashly by sending people to stop it and transporting in nitrate blocks, which aggravated the situation. This was also inappropriate, and the Ministry of Enterprise was ordered to educate him. (Hua Dong)

　　冀南行署副主任高元贵  邯郸市政府市长袁崇德
    违反纪律受到处分
    【本报专访】华北人民政府于三月一日发出通令，对冀南制药厂与硝磺总局争占前晋冀鲁豫边区参议会房产纠纷案，决定予冀南行政公署副主任高元贵，邯郸市政府市长袁崇德以记过处分。该案事实经过是：为华北人民政府所有而委托邯郸市政府代管之前晋冀鲁豫边区参议会房产，去年十月，经华北财经委员会决定，将上项房产划给硝磺总局占用，曾由华北政府财政部正式函令移交，而邯郸市政府事前未经请示报告华北政府，即擅自将该项房产允许冀南制药厂占用。当邯郸市府得悉上项决定后，仍听任冀南制药厂率领工匠拆卸参议会大礼堂。时冀南行署副主任高元贵正在邯郸，对冀南制药厂此种错误行为，不但未加制止，并对硝磺局派往交涉之人员数次均避不见面，以致硝磺局出面干涉拆卸大礼堂而发生纠纷冲突。后华北政府再次决定，令邯郸市府移交，同时令正在邯郸检查工作之人民监察院副院长王力对此事进行检查，并指示冀南行署与有关方面共同检查，召开检讨会，复经人民监察院屡次调查，事实真象已明，人民监察院以案关违反行政纪律签呈议处，经华北人民政府委员会决议，为整肃政风，执行政纪，反对无政府无组织状态，特决定对副主任高元贵等分别予以下列之处分：
    一、冀南行署副主任高元贵对制药厂拆房不加制止，对硝磺局派人会商又拒不见面，显系有意违抗上级命令，以致酿成纠纷，应负行政上之责任。决定予以违犯行政纪律的记过处分。
    二、邯郸市府市长袁崇德受本府委托代管房产，乃于处理该代管房产时，事前既不请示，事又不据实报告，有意忽视本府决定，诿避责任，亦决定予以记过处分。
    三、冀南制药厂厂长杨绍先抱抢占地方的错误思想，在财政部指示到后，抢先搬入，动工拆除大礼堂，及至硝磺局出面干涉，不惜酿成纠纷，积极强行搬拆，毫不顾及租用参议会会址之两家商人营业权益，与在广大人民中之政治影响，此种抢夺地盘式的行为殊不应有，其片面主观的思想方法与具有严重地方主义处理问题的手段，虽系执行直属上级命令，亦应严加教育，暂免处分，令其深刻反省。
    四、硝磺厂厂长王鹏飞开始虽遵照政府命令以协商态度谋求解决问题，但在制药厂搬入时，未能冷静考虑问题，听候政府解决，而鲁莽从事派人制止，并运入硝块，致使事态严重，亦属不当，决责成企业部予以教育。　（华栋）
