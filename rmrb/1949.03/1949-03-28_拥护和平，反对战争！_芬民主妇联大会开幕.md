　　Uphold Peace, Oppose War!
　　Finnish Democratic Women's Federation Congress Opens
    [Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 26th] TASS dispatch: The Second Congress of the Finnish Democratic Women's Federation opened in Helsinki on March 24th. The congress is proceeding under the slogan of "Uphold Peace, Oppose War." More than 400 delegates are attending, along with representatives from various Finnish democratic organizations and women representatives from Hungary and Czechoslovakia. Anna Őrevaara, Chairperson of the Finnish Democratic Women's Federation, reported to the congress on the work and tasks of the federation. She emphasized that, under the current circumstances, the focus of the federation's activities must be on striving for peace and democracy, and on opposing the reactionaries and the struggle against war. She sharply criticized the Fagerholm government of the right-wing Social Democratic Party for abandoning its post-war democratic policies and attempting to lead Finland down the counter-revolutionary road of fascism and war. She said: Today, as the aggressive Atlantic Alliance is expanding into the Scandinavian Peninsula and approaching the Finnish border, it is particularly important to establish a truly democratic government in Finland that defends the cause of peace not only in words but also in deeds. In her concluding remarks, she pointed out that the Finnish Democratic Women's Federation faces significant tasks: to fight for the complete equality of women, for the democratic transformation of school education, and for the universal improvement of the material well-being of the working people.

　　拥护和平，反对战争！
  　芬民主妇联大会开幕
    【新华社北平廿六日电】塔斯社讯：芬兰民主妇女联盟第二届代表大会已于三月二十四日在赫尔辛基开幕。大会在“拥护和平，反对战争”的口号下进行，出席代表四百余名，并有芬兰各民主组织的代表以及匈牙利与捷克斯洛伐克的妇女代表列席。芬兰民主妇联主席安娜·渥瓦雷宁向大会报告联盟的工作与任务。她强调指出，在目前情况下，联盟活动的重心必须放在争取和平与民主，反对反动派与战争的斗争上去，她尖锐批评右翼社会民主党的法吉荷尔姆政府，放弃战后的民主政策，力图把芬兰导向法西斯与战争的反革命的道路。她说：今天当侵略的大西洋联盟正在扩大到斯堪的纳维亚半岛并接近芬兰边界的时候，在芬兰成立一个不仅在口头上而是在行动上保卫和平事业的真正的民主政府，就成为特别重要。她在结语中指出，芬兰民主妇女联盟面临着重大任务，要为妇女的完全平等，为学校教育的民主改造，为劳动人民物质福利的普遍提高而斗争。
