　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 27th. TASS reports: In support of the Soviet Union's struggle for lasting world peace and democracy, the Democratic Women's League of Germany, starting from February 8th, launched a petition signature campaign in the Soviet-occupied zone of Germany and Berlin, demanding that the United Nations ban atomic weapons. In just a few days, 5,286,409 peace-loving and democratic German women had signed the petition. On February 17th, a delegation from the Democratic Women's League of Germany, led by General Secretary Runmeist, visited Smirnov, the political advisor to the Soviet military government in Germany, and presented a letter to Chairman Stalin of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union. When handing over the letter, Runmeist stated: "In support of the Soviet Union's struggle for universal democratic peace, women in the Soviet-occupied zone of Germany and Berlin have collected signatures for a petition to the United Nations demanding a ban on atomic weapons. In the Western-occupied zones of Germany, the occupying authorities, fearing that the German people would support peace, have prohibited the collection of signatures. However, women in the Western-occupied zones of Germany have recently begun this signature campaign as well. This movement of German women demonstrates the German people's struggle for peace, unity, and national independence. German women place their greatest hope for realizing their aspirations in the Soviet Union." When accepting the letter from the delegation, Smirnov stated: This letter will be forwarded to Chairman Stalin of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union without delay.

　　五百余万德国妇女要求禁用原子武器
    【新华社陕北二十七日电】塔斯社讯：为支持苏联争取世界持久与民主和平的斗争，德国民主妇女联盟，自二月八日起，在德境苏占区及柏林发动要求联合国禁用原子武器请愿书的签名运动。几天以后，已有五百二十八万六千四百零九个爱好和平民主的德国妇女签了名。二月十七日，德国民主妇女联盟的代表团，由总书记伦美斯特率领，往访德境苏联军政府政治顾问斯米尔诺夫，面交致苏联部长会议主席斯大林的信。伦美斯特在递交该信时称：“为支持苏联争取普遍民主和平的斗争，德境苏占区和柏林的妇女征集了向联合国要求禁止原子武器的请愿书的签名。在德境西占区中，害怕德国人民支持和平的占领当局不许收集签名。但德境西占区的妇女，近来也开始了这一签名运动。德国妇女的这个运动，表现了德国人民的争取和平、统一与国家独立的斗争。德国妇女把实现其热望的最大希望寄托在苏联身上。”斯米尔诺夫在自代表团手中接受该信时称：这封信将毫不延搁地转交苏联部长会议主席斯大林。
