　　Democratic Leadership in the Forward Factory
    Tian Liu, Zhang Shen

    This newspaper published an article on February 7th entitled "The Forward Factory is Advancing," which recounted the significant achievements of this factory in the enthusiastic production competition of workers. The increased production income not only compensated for the losses incurred during the half-month of work stoppage in October of last year due to war preparedness, but also resulted in an increased production equivalent to 420,836 jin of rice.

    The factory's achievement of such significant results was primarily due to the increased class consciousness and active production of all employees, while the factory's democratic leadership played an important guaranteeing role.

    Democratic Management in Production

    Before the launch of the increased production competition, the factory leadership first formulated an increased production competition plan based on the unprecedentedly high production enthusiasm of all employees in the war preparedness, demobilization, and factory construction, as well as the existing factory equipment and staffing. Subsequently, party member meetings, employee meetings, and meetings of directors and trade union cadres from each factory and workshop were convened to deliberate, mobilize, discuss, and study, so as to turn the plan into the employees' own plan. During the discussions, workers actively put forward many valuable opinions for revising and supplementing the plan. For example, the renovation workshop proposed that a "spare parts replenishment system" should be established, that is, commonly used parts should be cast in advance so that they can be repaired immediately upon arrival at the factory, so as to overcome the past practice of temporarily manufacturing parts after the locomotive entered the factory, which prolonged the time. After the implementation of this system, the repair time of locomotives in the factory was shortened from 24-28 days to 17 days. In the past, the warehouse only accepted finished products, resulting in the accumulation of many semi-finished products in various factories due to different production conditions, which made management cumbersome and cost calculation difficult, and still required processing when used, wasting labor. Hu Yulin, the work section chief of the production section, proposed the establishment of a "finished product and raw material delivery to warehouse system" to correct this problem. At the same time, the goods manufactured by various assisting factories and workshops were also changed to a "make-and-deliver system," which could reduce many unnecessary trips compared to the previous method adopted by the host factory. All of these were immediately accepted by the leadership and established as systems after being proposed by workers and staff.

    In the course of the competition, the factory's administrative cadres also implemented democratic management in daily production. For example, Guo Fengxiang, director of the repair workshop, consulted with workers' meetings in relevant departments to discuss and study methods for each specific production task. Therefore, the workshop completed its work quickly and well. However, he did not take credit for himself, but attributed the credit to the workers. He said, "The good completion of the repair workshop's work is entirely due to the workers' efforts. Everyone came up with ideas and everyone actively produced." Therefore, the workers were even more cordial and supportive of him.

    Secondly, the workers in each factory and workshop elected their own representatives to form the evaluation committee for the increased production competition period. This was an organization that was most closely connected with all employees and was highly valued by the workers. It collected model deeds, inventions, and production experiences in the competition every day and disseminated them in a timely manner. There were also two members of the evaluation committee who were specifically responsible for news reporting. They set up six blackboard newspapers, which reported the model deeds of advanced workers every day. In a month and a half of competition, more than 40 issues of blackboard newspapers were published, and the production enthusiasm of all employees in the factory was improved due to the introduction and dissemination of their model deeds by the blackboard newspapers.

    The third important improvement was the establishment of business meetings. According to the needs of the work, the production section regularly convened directors, foremen, and relevant personnel from various workshops to discuss the repair schedule and delivery date of each vehicle. This not only had the effect of collective leadership and collective wisdom, but also made the allocation to the workers doing that work more specific and appropriate because the discussion was thorough and detailed.

    Improvement of Production Organization

    Due to the democratic nature of production leadership, it also greatly promoted the improvement of production organization and implemented the "shift system": Before June of last year, the forging workshop had to start a fire to burn iron every time they started work, which took at least half an hour to actually start production. Half an hour before the end of the shift, they could no longer burn iron, because the iron was just burned well when it was time to get off work, so each shift wasted an hour. Since the implementation of the shift system, this shortcoming has been completely overcome. The previous shift gets off work, and the next shift immediately takes over. The iron burned by the previous shift is continued by the next shift, without having to start another fire, and there is no interval time in the middle. The establishment of this system alone increased production efficiency by 12.5 percent. The workers in the boiler making workshop who repair boilers also adopted the shift system, dividing the original number of people into day and night shifts for continuous production, shortening the boiler repair time, which provided an important guarantee for shortening the locomotive repair schedule in the factory. Furthermore, the vehicle entry inspection system was established. Before the competition, the inspection of locomotive boilers was carried out by external tapping to distinguish the inspection method. After the competition, the production enthusiasm of employees was improved and the sense of responsibility was greatly enhanced. Inspectors and workers from the boiler making workshop drilled into the dirty and dark interior of the boiler to check one by one; in the past, the inspection of passenger and freight cars was carried out by each production team after disassembly upon entry to the factory, and each production team inspected its own parts. Now, a special passenger and freight car entry inspection organization has been set up. After the vehicles are disassembled, the bad places are inspected one by one, and then each team is instructed to repair them according to the instructions, and the relevant assisting factories and workshops are notified in writing to repair and manufacture the missing parts in a timely manner, which improves the production quality and shortens the vehicle repair time in the factory. Secondly, the vehicle workshop also divided the workers in the workshop into groups, led by the group leader to strengthen the repair system. As a result, the number of vehicles leaving the factory increased significantly, from 38 vehicles per month before the competition to 68 vehicles during the competition. Furthermore, a central tool room was established. In the past (during the enemy-puppet Kuomintang occupation), each factory and workshop solved the tools they used by themselves, which caused problems such as inconvenient tool management, non-unified procurement, and tools could not be used flexibly. Since the establishment of the central tool room, the replenishment, repair, manufacturing, and purchase of tools have been rapid and timely, completely overcoming the above-mentioned shortcomings and directly improving the production efficiency of workers.

    Closer Relationship Among Employees

    As a result of the implementation of democratic production management, the relationship between the factory's administrative leaders and the workers has become closer. Liu Changfa, deputy director of the vehicle workshop, and foreman Xia Jun often help workers work. Duan Weibang, a worker in the repair workshop, said of the leaders of the workshop: "They are honest and kind, and the workers trust them." Before liberation, workers most opposed and hated inspectors. After liberation, the factory was the people's own, but some workers still thought that the inspectors were "picking bones" and "finding fault," but during the competition, the inspectors took the initiative to guide the workers technically and personally helped with the work. For example, when inspector Zhu Nian checked a locomotive and found a leaking screw support on the boiler, he immediately helped repair it. He did not eat lunch and did not get off work until it was repaired. Li Guanghui also often helped with the work, which made the workers realize that the current inspectors were of one heart with them and were all working to make the products better, and the unity was strengthened.

    The phenomenon of mutual concealment and waiting in the past among various factories and workshops has also decreased, and it has been replaced by mutual encouragement and help. For example, in order to strive to test the water pressure of two boilers on December 10, the workers in the renovation workshop helped the workers in the boiler making workshop repair the boilers after finishing their own work on the 9th, and successfully realized the plan to test the water pressure on the 10th. All the workers in the factory also organized a technical research association during the lunch break to teach each other technology, which not only significantly improved the technology of each employee, but also strengthened the unity of the workers.

### 前进工厂的民主领导

　　前进工厂的民主领导
    田流　张深
    本报于二月七日曾发表了“前进工厂在前进中”一文，记述了这个工厂在工人的积极生产竞赛中获得了很大的成绩，增产收益除弥补了去年十月间备战时停工半月的损失外，还增产折合四十二万零八百三十六市斤米。
    该厂所以获得如此巨大的成绩，除了主要是由于全体职工阶级觉悟提高积极生产外，工厂的民主领导是起了重要保证作用的。
    生产中的民主管理
    在增产竞赛运动开展之前，工厂领导上首先根据全体职工在备战复员建厂中空前高涨的生产情绪，和现有的工厂设备与人员配备情况，拟定增产竞赛计划。随后便分别召开了党员大会、职工大会、各厂所主任、工会干部会议，进行酝酿动员，讨论研究，使计划变成职工自己的计划。在讨论中，工人们都积极地提出不少修改和补充计划的宝贵意见，装修所在讨论中提出：应建立“备品补充制度”，即预先就把常用的机件铸造出来，车一入厂就能马上修理，以克服过去机车入厂后，再临时制造而延长了时间。这制度实行后，机车在厂修理时间，由过去的二十四日——二十八日缩短到十七日。过去仓库只收成品，造成各厂因生产情况不同，堆积着许多半成品，以致管理繁琐，成本计算困难，及至使用时仍须加工，浪费劳力。生产科工作股长胡玉琳为改正这一毛病，提出建立“成品原料交库制度”。同时，各协助厂所制造的物品，也改成“作好送交制”，这样可较以前由主办厂采取的办法，减少了好多不必要的往返。所有这些，由工人和职员们提出后，领导上立即接受，并订为制度。
    在竞赛过程中，工厂行政干部也贯彻了对日常生产中的民主管理，如修配所主任郭凤祥，对每个具体生产任务的进行，都是经过有关部门的工人会议，商量研究办法。因此该所完成工作又快又好。但他并不以功自居，而将功劳归于工人，他说：“修配所工作完成的好，全是工友的功劳，大家出主意，大家积极生产得来的。”因此工人就对他更亲热更拥护。
    其次是由各厂所工人自己选举代表，组织了增产竞赛期间的评功委员会，这是和全体职工联系最密切的、被工友非常重视的一个机构。它每天都在搜集着竞赛中的模范事迹、创造发明及生产经验，及时的传播出去。评功委员会里，还有两个委员，专门负责通讯报导工作。他们办了六块黑板报，每天都在反映着先进工人的模范事迹。在一个半月的竞赛中，黑板报出了四十期以上，有百名以上的职工，由于黑板报对他们模范事迹的介绍与传播，提高了全厂职工的生产情绪。
    第三个重要的改进是建立起业务会议，按照工作的需要，由生产科召集各所主任、领班及有关人员，经常讨论每一辆车的修理日程和出厂日期。这不但可以收到集体领导集思广益之效，还因为讨论的周到细致，分配到作那一工作的工人身上时，就更具体恰当。
    改进生产组织
    由于生产领导的民主，也大大推动了生产组织的改进，实行了“接班制”：锻工所在去年六月份以前，每班上工后都得生火烧铁，至少需要半点钟才能真正的开始生产。到下班前半点钟也就不能再烧铁了，因铁刚烧好就到了下工时间，这样每班就浪费了一个钟头。自从实行接班制后，这个缺点便完全克服了。前班下工，后班马上接着。前班烧好的铁，后班接着打，也不用再生一回火，中间没有一点间歇时间。仅仅这一制度的建立，就提高了生产效率百分之十二点五。制炉所修锅炉的工友也采用接班制，把原有人数分成日夜班，连续生产，缩短了修理锅炉时间，这就使全体机车在厂施修日程缩短得到了重要的保证，再就是建立了车辆入检制度，竞赛前，对机车锅炉的检查采用在外部敲音辨别检查法，竞赛后，职工生产情绪提高，责任心大大增强，检查员和制炉所工友钻到污黑的锅炉内部去一一检查；客货车的检查过去是入厂解体后，各生产班各自检查自己部分，现在专门设置了客货车入厂检查组织，车辆解体后，一一检查不良处所，然后指示各班照修，并以书面通知有关协助厂所及时修配制造所缺之机件，提高了生产质量，又缩短了车辆在厂施修时间。其次车辆所又将该所工友分别编成小组，由小组长领导工作，加强了修理制度，结果出厂车辆显著增加，由竞赛前的月出三十八辆增加到竞赛期的六十八辆。再是建立起总工具室，过去（敌伪国民党侵占时期）都是各个厂所使用的工具由其自行解决，发生工具管理不便，筹购不统一，工具不能活用等毛病，自总工具室建立后，对工具的补充、修理、制造及购置上迅速及时，完全克服了上述缺点，直接提高了工人生产效率。
    职工关系更密切了
    实行生产民主管理的结果，工厂行政领导人员同工人关系更加密切，车辆所副主任刘长发，领班夏峻经常帮助工人作活。修配所工友段维邦谈到本所领导人时说：“正直和气，工人们都信服。”在解放前工人最反对痛恨检查员，解放后，工厂是人民自己的了，但开始仍有些工人认为检查员是“挑刺”“找蹩扭的”，但竞赛中由于检查员在技术上主动指导工友，还亲自下手帮助工作，如检查员朱年在某机车点火试车时，检查出锅炉上一个螺撑漏水，就立即帮助修理。中午不吃饭，修好才下班。李广辉也是常常帮助工作，这样使工友们认识了现在的检查员和自己是一个心，都为了把产品作的更好，团结加强了。
    各个厂所问过去某些互相瞒怨等待的现象也少了，代之而起的是互相鼓励和帮助。如装修所为了争取在十二月十日试验两个锅炉压水，工友们在九日这天把自己的活作完后，又帮助制炉所工友们修理锅炉，胜利的实现了十日压水的计划。全厂工友们并利用中午休息时间组织了技术研究会，互相传习技术，不但使每个职工的技术有显著的进步，还加强了工友们的团结。
