　　Xinhua News Agency, Peiping, 10th—Public enterprise employees and public education personnel in Peiping have begun to receive their provisional wages and salaries for February, starting March 1st. The calculation standards for provisional wages stipulate that employee wages are calculated from the date of takeover, based on the average actual wages issued by the original agency in the three months of September, October, and November of last year. The principle of issuing wages is half in cash and half in grain. Within a certain period after the salary is paid, employees can purchase millet from the cooperative of their respective enterprise, agency, or school at the rice price at the time of salary payment. The aforementioned measures are temporary measures before the new wage standards are finally determined, and were determined after the Military Control Commission convened several discussions with relevant departments in Peiping and representatives of employee groups.

　　北平公营企业及学校发放二月份临时工薪
    【新华社北平十日电】北平市各公营企业职工及公教人员的二月份临时工资与薪金，已自三月一日开始陆续发放。临时薪资的计算标准办法规定：职工工资自接管之日起算，以去年九、十、十一三个月原机关所发实际工资的平均数计算。工资发放以钱粮各半为原则。在发薪后一定期限内，职工可按发薪时的米价向所属企业机关学校的合作社购买小米。上述办法为新的工薪标准尚未最后确定前的临时措施，系军管会数次召集平市有关部门及职工团体代表研讨后确定者。
