Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 7th. According to a Telecommunication Agency report from Copenhagen on the 4th: The great peace movement organized by the Danish Communist Party has spread throughout the country. Public rallies have been held in all towns and cities, large and small, with unprecedented participation. Prominent Danish intellectuals have also joined the Communist Party in issuing warnings to the war government. These intellectuals include Dr. Mogens Fog (Professor), a leader of the Danish resistance movement, Dr. Jørgen Jørgensen, Dr. Albert Olsen, and Dr. Stig Weibel. On the other hand, the Danish government announced on the 4th that Danish Foreign Minister Rasmussen would travel to Washington next week for direct contact with the U.S. government to seek a final decision on Denmark's attitude toward the North Atlantic Pact. The efforts of the Danish right-wing Social Democratic Party to drag Denmark into the Anglo-American war bloc have entered a new stage. The Central Committee of the Danish Social Democratic Party, meeting on February 27, effectively gave the government full power to sign the North Atlantic Pact. However, this does not mean that American war policy has won the support of the majority of the Danish people, or even the majority of the Social Democratic Party members. While the Central Committee of the Social Democratic Party was meeting, 1,200 representatives representing more than 100,000 workers from 300 factories and workshops in Copenhagen were also meeting. They passed a resolution condemning "attempts to bring Denmark into the North Atlantic or any other military bloc organization." The conference declared: "We believe that this bloc policy is in the most profound contradiction with the interests of peace and the interests of our country, because it can only increase the danger of war, accelerate the reorganization of armaments, and increase the burden of new taxes on the people."

　　丹共发起和平运动
  　丹麦全国集会反战
    【新华社陕北七日电】据电通社哥本哈根四日讯：丹麦共产党所组织的大和平运动，已经遍及全国。一切大小城镇都举行了公共集会，参加者空前地多。著名的丹麦知识分子，也和共产党一起发出了对战争政府的警告。这些知识分子中，有丹麦抵抗运动的领袖摩格斯·福格博士（教授），约根·约根逊博士，阿柏特·奥尔散博士，和斯提格·魏柏博士。另一方面，丹麦政府却于四日宣布了丹麦外长拉斯穆荪将在下周赴华盛顿和美国政府直接接触，以寻求决定丹麦对北大西洋公约的最后态度。丹麦右翼社会民主党之力图把丹麦拖入美英战争集团的努力，于此开始了一个新阶段。在二月二十七日开会的丹麦社会民主党中央委员会，实际上给了政府以在北大西洋公约上签字的全权委任状。但是，这并不意味着美国战争政策已经争得大多数丹麦人民，甚至争得大多数社会民主党党员群众的支持。在社会民主党中央委员会开会的同时，代表哥本哈根三百家工厂作坊十万以上工人的一千二百名代表也在开会，他们通过了决议，斥责“把丹麦带入北大西洋或任何其他军事集团组织的尝试”。大会宣称：“我们认为这种集团政策，是与和平的利益和我们国家的利益有最深刻的矛盾的。因为这只能增加战争的危险，加速整顿军备，给人民增加新的捐税负担”。
