　　Jizhong Water Conservancy Promotion Society Established
　　Dispatching Work Teams to Assist Farmers in Promoting Water Wheels
　　[Jizhong News] In accordance with the instructions of the North China People's Government and to meet the needs of production, the Jizhong Water Conservancy Promotion Society was formed on the 26th of last month by merging three water conservancy promotion societies to unify the leadership of water wheel and water well promotion in the entire Jizhong area. The society is located in Baoding and has three sections: business, production, and credit. It also has a distribution office in Anguo and Xinji to promote water wheels and well-drilling equipment. The society has already purchased 719 water wheels, 10,000 jin of palm fiber, 200 bamboo tubes, 6,000 jin of iron wire, and 30 iron hammers, and will continue to purchase raw materials for water wheels and water buckets, support water wheel factories, and study ways to improve the quality of water wheels to meet the needs of farmers. The society has recently dispatched three work teams to Jin County, Ding County, and Qingyuan County, three key water conservancy counties, to cooperate with local governments, using forms such as old peasant forums, to explain the benefits of turning dry land into paddy fields through accounting methods, carry out publicity and preparation, and mobilize farmers to repair, purchase, and dig water wheels and water wells. At the same time, it will organize smelting furnaces and well-drilling teams to solve the technical difficulties of farmers. To increase the enthusiasm of farmers in developing water conservancy, the work teams will work with the government to resolve disputes arising from the use of water wheels and water wells, clarify ownership, and democratically discuss and formulate public covenants for the protection of water wheels and water wells.
