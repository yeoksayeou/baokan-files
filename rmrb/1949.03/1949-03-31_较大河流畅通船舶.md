Larger Rivers Open to Navigation

The inland waterways now open to navigation include the Wei Canal, the Fuyang (upper reaches of the Ziya River), the Hutuo (upper reaches of the Ziya River), the Ziya River, the Daqing River, and the North Canal. According to existing statistics, the Fuyang River has a total of 300 ships, with a carrying capacity of 24 million catties. The Wei Canal has 500 ships from Daokou to Tianjin, with a carrying capacity of 32 million catties. Preparations are now underway to restore small steamboats capable of operating on inland rivers.

    内河航运已通航的计有卫运、滏阳（子牙河上游）、滹沱、（子牙河上游）、子牙、大清、北运诸河。据已有统计，滏阳河共有航船三百艘，载重二千四百万斤。卫运河从道口到天津有船五百艘，载重三千二百万斤。现并进一步筹备恢复能在内河行驶的小汽船。
