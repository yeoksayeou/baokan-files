　　Two Female Sharpshooters
    By Ye. Nesterovskaya, Translated by Gao Shikun
    Masha Bolivanova worked in a factory and was a Stakhanovite. She had hoped to become a construction engineer and also wanted to apply to the aviation academy, but Masha had only completed the seventh grade of middle school, and she needed to prepare many courses to get into the aviation academy. In a company, she met Natasha Ketianshaova. Natasha also hoped to enter the Moscow Aviation Academy.
    "Okay, let's prepare together, I'll help you," Natasha suggested. Natasha was a top student who had graduated from the tenth grade. She was able to help her girlfriend.
    Hope, work, and nightly studies brought the two girls closer together.
    After the war began, these two girlfriends entered a sharpshooter training class. In October 1941, they went to the headquarters of the Communist camp together. The political commissar of the camp recalled the scene at the time:
    "Two girls stood in front of me, the smaller one looking at the larger one, both of them fidgeting. Then the larger one said:
    'We are here to volunteer.'
    The smaller one quickly added:
    'We are both members of the Communist Youth League.'
    Their innocent appearance, so incompatible with the war, made the volunteers standing beside them laugh. In order to cope with the cruel battles, the camp was reorganized, so I rejected them. Who knew that in an instant they became as stubborn as men. The taller one raised her head and said:
    'Does that mean you won't accept us?'
    The smaller one added:
    'Then we are not convinced.'
    The taller one continued:
    'First, we are sharpshooters...'
    'Sharpshooters?' This was simply unexpected for me.
    'Yes, sharpshooters, we graduated from the training class,' they said confidently."
    Kovshova and Bolivanova were accepted into the camp. In the camp, they did not separate and did everything together. Soldiers and officers naturally treated these two young girls with fatherly care. Major Darasov recalled:
    "Whenever I got something delicious, I always wanted to treat these two girls."
    This made them a little unhappy, and they hoped not to be treated like this.
    After the camp sent rifles equipped with scopes, these two girls were assigned to train sharpshooters, and they proved to be very competent and strict instructors. They were both given the rank of sergeant. But the veteran soldiers still treated them politely like girls. Only later in the battle did everyone understand that Kovshova and Bolivanova were truly soldiers in every sense of the word.
    The time came for every soldier to fulfill their oath, and these two simple Soviet girls immortalized themselves by heroically fulfilling their obligations to the motherland.
    In a brutal battle, when Natasha Kovshova had to replace the sacrificed sharpshooter team commander, the Germans happened to launch a counterattack.
    "We should retreat..." Before a frightened soldier could finish speaking, he was stared back by the stern gaze of the female commander.
    "Of course, he's just joking," her female companion said in a low, disgusted tone. "If it's not a joke, then I personally will shoot him dead here!"
    Kovshova ordered that no one was allowed to fire without her command, and she only gave the order to fire when they could no longer wait. In this way, the German counterattack was repelled. The enemy then began to bombard the Soviet sharpshooters with mortars. After the mortar bombardment, the only people left under Kovshova's command were her loyal female partner, Masha. A seriously wounded Novikov was also lying next to them.
    "You should be carried down," Kovshova said, "but, you see, it's not possible anymore..."
    Later, Novikov recounted this incident in the military hospital:
    "Although she herself was also injured, she still wanted to help me. I saw them bandaging each other's wounds several times. They ran out of bullets and used grenades to fight the enemy. The Germans had completely crawled up close and shouted loudly: 'Russians, surrender!'"
    Novikov could not describe everything in detail, but he still remembered the last words of the two girls:
    "Dear Natasha," Bolivanova said, "I no longer have the strength to throw grenades."
    "There's no need to throw them," Natasha replied, "wait a moment and pull the pin..."
    At the same time, two explosions sounded. When the Germans who had crawled close jumped up, these two female partners pulled the pins of the grenades.
    Beside the bodies of the sacrificed heroines, lay many German soldiers' corpses.

　　两个女特等射手
    叶·涅捷勒斯卡  作  高世昆  译
    玛沙·包利瓦诺娃在工厂里做过工，是一个斯达哈诺夫者。她曾希望做一个建筑工程师，又想去考航空学院，但玛沙只读完了中学七年级，为了考进航空学院需要准备很多的课程。在一个公司里她认识了娜达沙·珂天少娃。娜达沙同样希望进入莫斯科航空学院。
    “好吧，咱们一块准备吧，我来帮助你。”娜达沙提议说。娜达沙是十年级毕业的优等生。她是能够帮助她的女友的。
    希望，工作和每天晚上的功课使这两个姑娘接近起来。
    战争开始后，这两个女友就进入特等射手训练班，一九四一年十月间她们俩就一块到了共产主义营营部。营政治委员回忆当时的情景说：
    “两个姑娘站在我的面前，小的看看大的，两个人都在局促不安。然后大的就说了：
    ‘我们是来参加志愿兵的。’
    小的就赶紧补充说：
    ‘我们都是少共团员。’
    她俩那一付天真的，与战争那么不相称的样子，站在旁边的那些志愿兵们都笑了。为了应付残酷的战斗，营进行了整编，因此我便拒绝了她们。谁知道一刹那间她们一下子变得男子那么倔强。那个大的昂着头说：
    ‘这就是说，你们不收我们吗？’
    小的补充说：
    ‘那我们是不服气的。’
    大的继续说：
    ‘第一，我们是特等射手，……’
    ‘特等射手？’这对我来说简直是想不到的。
    ‘是特等射手，我们是训练班毕业的。’她们肯定说。”
    珂夫少娃和包利瓦诺娃被收在营里了。在营里她们没有分开，什么都在一起做。战士和军官们自然地对这两个年轻的姑娘的态度，象父亲般的爱护她们。达拉索夫少校回忆说：
    “只要我搞到什么好吃的东西，我总愿意拿来款待这两个姑娘。”
    这使她们有些不痛快，她俩希望不要这样对待她们。
    营里送来了装有瞄准镜的步枪以后，就委派这两个姑娘训练特等射手，她们表现出是很称职的和严格的教官。她们俩个都给予了上士的军衔。但老战士们仍然象对待姑娘似的礼貌对待她们。只有以后在战斗中大家才明白了，珂夫少娃和包利瓦诺娃真正是名符其实的军人。
    每一个战士实现誓言的时候到来了，而这两个朴实的苏联姑娘是英勇地为祖国完成了自己的义务而永垂不朽。
    在残酷的战斗中，当娜达沙、珂夫少娃不得不代替牺牲了的特等射手组指挥官时，恰好德国人转入反扑。
    “应该往后退，……”一个害怕的战士的话还没说完，就给这个女指挥官的严厉的目光盯回去了。
    “当然他这是说玩笑，——她的女伴用低沉的厌恶的语气向她说——假如不是玩笑，那末我个人就把他打死在这里！”
    珂夫少娃命令没有她的口令不准开火，直到再也不能等的时候她才发出开火的口令，就这样德国人的反扑被打退了。敌人便开始用迫击炮向苏联的特等射手们轰击。迫击炮的轰击之后，珂夫少娃指挥之下的人就只剩下她的忠实的女伙伴玛沙了。旁边还躺着一个重伤的诺维可夫。
    “应该把你抬下去的，——珂夫少娃说，——只是，你看，不能够了……”
    以后诺维可夫在军医院里讲述这回事说：
    “虽然她自己也负了伤，但还想帮助我。我看到她们俩个互相包扎了好几次伤。她们打光了子弹，就用手榴弹抗击敌人。德国人已经完全爬到近前，并大声叫喊：‘俄国人投降吧！’”
    诺维可夫不能详述一切，但他还记得这两个姑娘最后的话：
    “亲爱的娜达沙，——包利瓦诺娃说——我已经再没有力量投手榴弹了。”
    “用不到投了，——娜达沙回答说，——等一下拉响……”
    同时响起了两声爆炸。当爬到跟前的德国人跳起来的时候，这两个女伙伴便拉响了手榴弹。
    在牺牲了的女英雄的身旁，躺着好多个德国兵的尸体。
