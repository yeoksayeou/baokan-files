Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 28th. TASS Moscow dispatch: On February 25th, the three major Soviet newspapers published articles by Czechoslovak political leaders commemorating the first anniversary of the purge of the traitorous plans of Czech reactionaries. *Pravda* published an article by Rudolf Slánský, General Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia, *Izvestia* published an article by Czechoslovak Foreign Minister Clementis, and *Red Star* published an article by Czechoslovak Defense Minister Svoboda.

Slánský's article stated: The February events were the culmination of the tenacious struggle of progressive forces against reactionaries. Since 1945, when the Soviet army liberated Czechoslovakia and the republic embarked on a new path of people's democracy, the reactionaries have gathered strength and conspired to revolt. To detach Czechoslovakia from the peace camp headed by the Soviet Union and, with the help of the Marshall Plan, turn it into a protectorate of the United States—this was the main goal pursued by Czechoslovak and foreign reactionaries. As for domestic affairs, the reactionaries were concerned with reversing Czechoslovakia's development, gradually returning it to capitalism, eliminating all democratic achievements, returning large estates to landlords, returning factories and banks to capitalists, and abolishing people's committees at all levels, replacing them with a capitalist bureaucratic police system. Slánský particularly emphasized: The February of 1948 confirmed the correctness of the general line of the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia and demonstrated the high level of political and organizational maturity of the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia. Due to the vigilance and preparedness of the Communist Party, the February conspiracy was extinguished as soon as it emerged. When discussing the process of democratic development after the February events, Slánský pointed out that industry, trade, and agriculture have achieved significant successes. Czechoslovakia's position in world politics has been strengthened since February 1948, and its economic relations with friendly countries, especially the Soviet Union, have become much closer.

　　苏联三大报纸
  　刊登捷共领袖论文
    【新华社陕北二十八日电】塔斯社莫斯科讯：二月二十五日，苏联三大报纸登载捷克斯洛伐克政治领袖的文章，纪念清除捷克反动派叛国计划的一周年。真理报刊载捷共中央委员会总书记斯兰斯基的论文，消息报登载捷外长克里门蒂斯的论文，红星报发表捷国防部长斯沃波达的论文。
    斯兰斯基的论文称：二月事件是进步势力对反动派的顽强斗争的顶点。自一九四五年苏联军队解放捷克斯洛伐克共和国走上新的人民民主的道路时起，反动派就集聚力量，阴谋作乱。使捷克斯洛伐克脱离以苏联为首的和平阵营，并借助于马歇尔计划使它变成美国的保护国，这就是捷克斯洛伐克的和外国的反动派所追逐的主要目的。至于内政方面，反动派则是关怀着倒转捷克斯洛伐克的发展，使它逐渐回到资本主义，消除一切民主成就，将大地产还给地主，将工厂和银行还给资本家，取消各级人民委员会而代替以资本主义的官僚警察制度。斯兰斯基特别强调地写道：一九四八年的二月，证实了捷共总路线的正确，表现了捷共在政治和组织方面的高度成熟。由于共产党的警惕和有准备，二月阴谋刚一露头即被扑灭。斯兰斯基论及二月事件以后的民主发展过程时指出，工业、贸易、农业都获得了重大成就。捷克在世界政治上的地位，自一九四八年二月以后益形强固，与友好国家特别是苏联的经济关系已大为密切。
