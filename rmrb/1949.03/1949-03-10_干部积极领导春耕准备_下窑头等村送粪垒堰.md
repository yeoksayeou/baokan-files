　　【Taiyue Telegram】In Jin City, after the completion of party rectification and land reform in 39 villages including Xia Yaotou and Liuquan Villages, the enthusiasm of the farmers for production has increased, and the party members and cadres are actively leading the work. They have generally started delivering manure and building embankments to prepare for spring ploughing ahead of time. Party members and cadres in Xia Yaotou Village in the Third District led the masses to deliver more than 1,500 carts of manure to the fields before the lunar New Year. In Dongtuhe in the Seventh District, party members Guo Jun, Chen Quansheng, Chen Liuxiang, Guo Renwang, and others used to only direct the masses without working hard themselves. Now they personally deliver manure and chop firewood with the masses, and have therefore been elected as mutual aid team leaders, gathering enough fuel coal for 45 households' spring ploughing in four days. Under the leadership and influence of party members and cadres, Liuquan Village and Shantouzhuang in the First District organized seven carts to pull manure to the fields as early as the fourth day of the new year. Yuan Shiqing and seven other newly-risen middle peasants in Shennanwan have delivered enough spring manure and built embankments, and are just waiting for the land to thaw before plowing. In Xiaotou Village, farmers are not only delivering manure but also rushing to repair fields and build embankments. Poor peasant Cheng Xiaodan has recently rebuilt old embankments that had been neglected for several years. Middle peasant Cheng Tianjun did not stop working on the thirtieth day of the twelfth lunar month, but continued to build embankments in the fields. In addition, all villages are actively adding to their livestock. According to statistics from eighteen villages in the seven districts that have completed land reform, a total of 166 heads of livestock have been purchased recently. For example, Liu Xudui, an old middle peasant from Dazhuang, and six other families bought seven heads of livestock, and middle and poor peasants pooled their resources to elect Chang Shuanrong and two others to go to Zhoujiakou in Henan Province and buy 46 heads of livestock. These villages, after completing land reform, have begun to show a new atmosphere. In Santou Village in the Fifth District, an old middle peasant, Song Guojun, said: "Last year, new clothes were worn inside during the New Year, but this year new clothes were bought and worn outside during the New Year. Last year it was 'covering up wealth', this year we will open our hearts and work harder to produce."

　　干部积极领导春耕准备
  　下窑头等村送粪垒堰
    【太岳电】晋城下窑头、柳泉村等三十九个村，整党结束土地改革完成后，由于农民生产情绪提高，党员干部积极领导，现普遍开始送粪、垒堰，提早准备春耕。三区下窑头村党员干部，领导群众在阴历年前，已把一千五百多车粪送到地里。七区东土河党员郭俊，陈全生、陈六祥、郭仁旺等，过去是光指挥群众，自己不好好劳动；现在都亲自和群众在一起送粪打柴，因而被推选成互助组长，四天就把四十五户车春耕的燃煤担够了。在党员干部的领导和影响下，一区柳泉村、山头庄，初四就组织了七辆车往地里拉粪。神南湾新中农原世庆等七户，已春粪送够、堰垒齐，专等地开就要犁地。小头村农民除送粪外，都赶着修地垒堰。贫农程小旦，最近还把好几年的旧堰都垒起来了。中农程天俊，在腊月三十那天，也不停工，在地里垒堰。另外各村又都积极添买牲口。据七个区十八个完成结束土地改革村的统计，最近共添买牲口一百六十六头。如大庄老中农刘绪堆等七家，买回牲口七头，中、贫农又集股推选常拴荣等三人下河南省周家口，买回来牲口四十六头。这些结束土地改革后的村庄，开始出现了新气象。五区三头村，中农宋国俊老汉说：“去年过年，新衣裳穿在里面，今年过年买新衣裳穿在外面。去年是‘遮富’，今年就放开心加劲生产了。”
