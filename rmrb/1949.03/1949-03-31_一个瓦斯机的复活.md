　　The Revival of a Gas Engine
　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　Yao Fu
　　On the streets of Xinji City, one light shines particularly bright among the countless lights. This is the gate of the Jizhong State-owned Julong Iron Factory. Their machine room, offices, and dormitories are all equipped with electric lights, illuminating the entire factory.

　　When the Julong Iron Factory was established in 1945, it only had one manual round car. With the development and expansion of the factory, three round cars were converted to be driven by diesel engines between January and February 1948. However, due to the shortage of kerosene, they were soon switched back to manual power. The young apprentices were busy there all day, complaining, "It's back to rocking the wheel again." Indeed, solving the power problem and increasing production was the most urgent requirement for all employees.

　　Everyone racked their brains, researching ways to overcome the difficulties. In the dark room next to the machine room, there was a monster—the remains of a gas engine—which had been lying there dead for more than ten years since the day the Japanese invaders occupied Xinji. The parts had long been dismantled, the body was incomplete, headless and without brains, truly a mess. Some people had previously suggested smashing it into scrap iron, but inspector Zhang Lingkun firmly opposed it. He proactively suggested to the factory director to repair this gas engine. At first, the factory director was somewhat hesitant, but the workers unanimously agreed, especially because Zhang Lingkun had participated in the manufacturing process of the gas engine. He recognized that this was a product of his original factory, and he was familiar with everything inside. Thus, the gas engine revival work began.

　　Zhang Lingkun found the old worker Zhou Kaiqian. They had worked together for six or seven years in the past, both guarding the machine, but neither of them knew how to drive it. Since the machine was converted to electric power, it had been left untouched for more than twenty years, so the dimensions and appearance of some parts were blurred. They had to painstakingly study, draw diagrams, and make models one by one, manufacturing or purchasing them. They bought electric boxes, spark plugs, and water pipes from Shijiazhuang, and made axle tiles, air conditioning valves, and air-conditioning pumps themselves, using broken tin @ to replace fuses. Workers, technicians, and staff all mobilized to participate in the repair work. Especially in the last four days before the final completion, it became even more intense. The entire machine crew automatically worked overtime, busy there day and night; the factory director stayed in the machine room all day, covered in oil and mud; the head of the engineering department, whose legs could not move, also leaned on crutches, personally inspecting, researching, and giving ideas. In more than two months, more than one hundred parts were configured, practically turning it into a brand new machine, although some were no longer the original appearance.

　　Everyone was very happy and wished for the success of the repair. They loaded coal, hung the belts, and lit a big fire. Everyone watched the rotation of the wheels, listening quietly to the sound of gas combustion. Unfortunately, after working hard for another two whole days, the machine still did not move. The first failure led to new repair work. A small hand-cranked generator was added, and the air-conditioning pump was re-organized. Seeing that the winter production campaign had begun, everyone was eager to get the car running. They lit the coal for the second time, and after more than a day of work, it failed again.

　　However, the workers were not discouraged. On the contrary, it aroused even greater perseverance in them. They found an old worker surnamed Chen nearby to help with the repair. Everyone jointly discussed, inspected, and researched where the problem lay. Was it the relationship of the coke? It was changed from small pieces to large pieces, but it didn't work; was it entirely the relationship of the large pieces? Half of the small pieces were replaced on top, but it still didn't work. In fact, the problem was not here. Oh! The problem was found. The voltage of the equipped electric box was too high, so it was changed to a low-voltage ignition method; the amount of cold air and gas was not harmonized, so the cold air door was opened wider and the amount of gas was reduced. Let's try again. Each person carefully guarded their post, tightly shaking the electric wheel a few times, and only heard three "pop pop pop" sounds before the wheel started to rotate. Zhou Kaiqian's words were a completely scientific attitude. He said, "I fully believe that it can be successful. The machine will not lie, nor will it be sentimental. If it doesn't start, there must be a problem." They finally found the problem.

　　The wheels of the gas engine were spinning fiercely, and the apprentices were so happy that they couldn't even sleep. They began technical learning. Zhao Jianfang, who was learning to drive, said with a smile, "No more rocking the wheel." When the car was turned off that night, seven or eight members of the machine crew went to the furnace room to carefully inspect it, simply not knowing what to say. Zhao Jianfang deliberately said, "Humph! There's a hole in the belt." Zhao Qinghai frightened everyone, "Look! The screw here is more than an inch longer." The head of the car group, Fang Jinsheng, quickly took a lamp and touched it with his hand, objecting, "Nothing of the sort, don't worry." They carefully put away the oil bottles, opened the flue, released the hot water, cleaned the boiler, and loaded the coal. They also carefully put the parts away one by one, preparing for use the next day. They were very concerned about the life of the machine. The gas stove was leaking water, the cold air pump was leaking air, and the axle tile was burned out. The whole team automatically worked overtime to repair it overnight. Once, communist party members Fang Jinsheng and Zhao Qinghai had just returned from the branch meeting, and the machine had a problem. In order to complete the task, they didn't sleep for two nights and one day. With the acquisition of thirty horsepower, the efficiency of production generally increased by one-third compared to the original. The work that originally took six riveters three days to complete only required four people one day to complete easily. Only five hundred pounds of coal are needed every day, and two people watching the stove can replace sixteen wheel-rocking apprentices, ensuring the rotation of six round cars, one washing bed, and one planing bed. Not only did the entire factory have lights, but water pumping, charcoal grinding, iron melting, and iron eye drilling all utilized electricity. The draft animals and the kerosene for melting iron were no longer needed. They also plan to install electric saws, thread setting beds, electroplating... so that the horsepower can be fully utilized. Factory Director Liu said to me in front of the gas engine, "Although it doesn't look good, it's moving. This is the result of the workers' labor, this is a major change in the history of the factory. In the future, we must run the factory even better."

　　一个瓦斯机的复活
    药夫
    辛集市的街头，无数灯光中有一处特别明亮。这就是冀中国营聚隆铁工厂的大门。他们的机房、办公室、宿舍都按装了电灯，光明照耀着整个工厂。
    聚隆铁工厂在一九四五年开办时，只有一部人工圆车，随着工厂的发展和壮大，一九四八年一、二月间三部圆车改用柴油机来带动，但不久，因煤油的缺乏又改用人力。年青的学员们整天在那里忙碌，他们烦恼的说：“又摇起轮来了”。的确，解决动力问题，提高生产，是全体职工最迫切的要求。
    大家都费尽心思，研究克服困难的办法。机房一旁的暗室里放着一个怪物——瓦斯机——的残骸，自日寇占领辛集的一天起，十几年来一直僵死在那里，零件早已拆散一空，肢体不全，没头没脑，实在不成样子。以前有的人主张砸成碎铁用了，但是检查员张凌昆坚决反对，他主动地向厂长建议，要修理这部瓦斯机，起初厂长还有些犹疑，可是工人们却一致赞成，尤其因张凌昆曾参加过瓦斯机的制造过程，他认得这是自己原来工厂的产品，他熟习内部的一切，于是瓦斯机复活工作开始了。
    张凌昆找到老工人周凯前，他俩过去在一起作工六七年，都守着机器，可是他们都不会开车，自机器改用电力发动后，已放下二十多年不动了，所以有些零件的尺寸与模样已模糊不清了，只得苦心钻研，一件一件的绘图、制模型，制造或采买，从石门买来了电盒子、电火嘴和水管，自己造了轴瓦、冷气门、冷风泵，利用破锡＠代替了保险丝。工人、技师、职员一齐动员了起来参加修理工作，尤其临到最后完成的前四天，更加紧张起来。机工组全体自动加了工，日夜在那里忙碌；厂长整天不离机房，满身都是油埿；两腿不能动弹的工务科长，也拄了双拐，亲自检查、研究、出主意。两个多月工夫配置了一百多个零件，简直成了一部崭新的机器，只是有些已不是原来的模样。
    大家高兴得很，都预祝修理的成功，装好了煤炭，挂好了轮带，又生起了大火，每个人都注视着车轮的转动，静听瓦斯的燃烧声，不幸得很，整整又忙了两天，机器仍然照样不动。第一次的失败，又开始了新的修理工作，添设了手摇轮小型发电机，重新整理了冷风泵，眼看冬季生产运动开始了，大家为急于开车，第二次生起煤炭，闹了一天多，又归失败了。
    但是，工人们并不灰心，相反引起他们更大的毅力。找到附近一个姓陈的老工人帮助修理，大家共同讨论、检查，研究毛病在哪里。焦炭的关系吗？由小块换成了大块，不成；完全都是大块的关系吧？上边再换上一半小块还是不成，其实毛病并不在这里。哦！毛病找到了，配的电盒子电压太高了，改成低压打火法；冷风与瓦斯量不够调和，便开大了冷风门，缩小了瓦斯量。再试试看，各自谨慎守着自己的岗位，紧紧摇了几下电轮，只听“叭叭叭”响了三声，轮盘才开始转动了。周凯前的话是完全科学的态度，他说：“我完全相信能够成功，机器不会撒谎，也不会讲人情，开不动就一定有毛病。”这毛病他们终于找到了。
    瓦斯机的车轮在猛烈的转动着，学员们高兴的连觉都不能睡着，他们开始了技术学习。学开车的赵建芳笑咪咪的说：“不再摇轮了”。当晚上关车的时候，机工组的七八个人，都到炉房细心检查，简直不知说什么好。赵建芳故意说：“哼！轮带有个眼儿。”赵清海吓虎大家：“你看！这里螺丝长上一寸多了。”车子组长房进生赶快拿灯照着用手摸着反对说：“没有的事、放心。”他们细心的收起油瓶，打开烟道，放出热水，清理锅炉，装好煤炭。又细心的把零件一一妥放起来，预备第二天再用。他们非常关怀机器的寿命，瓦斯炉漏水了，冷风泵跑了气，轴瓦被烧毁，全组都自动加工连夜修理。一次共产党员房进生、赵清海刚开支部会回来，机器出了毛病，为了完成任务两夜一天没有睡觉。随着三十个马力的取得，生产的效力一般比原来提高了三分之一。原来铆锅六人三天的活只需四人一天便从容的完成了。每天只需五百斤煤炭，两个人看炉，便能代替十六个摇轮学员，保证六部圆车和一部洗床部一部刨床的转动，全厂不但有了灯光，而且抽水、碾炭、熔铁、钻铁眼都利用电力，拉碾的牲口和化铁的煤油都用不着了。他们还计划按装电锯、套丝床、电镀……使马力能得到充分的运用。刘厂长在瓦斯机前对我说：“看样子虽不好看可是他动起来了，这是工人劳动的成果，这是工厂有史以来的大变化，今后，要把工厂办得更好。”
