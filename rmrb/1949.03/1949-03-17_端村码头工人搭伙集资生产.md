　　【Jizhong Telegraph】The Duancun Waterside Dock Workers' Union in Anxin, after undergoing education and organizational rectification by the Jizhong Federation of Trade Unions, has developed various forms of production and improved living standards. Before the land reform, the village had two waterside workers' unions on the east and west sides, with a total of sixty-eight workers who made a living by portering. During the winter and spring when the river was frozen or there was little freight to transport, they would get together to eat, drink, and gamble, and did not organize any other production. The year before last, when the Jizhong Federation of Trade Unions learned about the situation, it focused on educating them about production, thrift, and establishing households. Initially, they believed that with so many people, it would be difficult to unite and organize. Later, after several rounds of education by the Federation of Trade Unions, they planted ten mu of rice. After harvesting the grain, everyone simply divided it up and ate it, and production did not take off. Last spring, in conjunction with the land reform work, the Federation of Trade Unions reached a consensus with the village's poor peasant association, merged the two unions, strengthened unified leadership, and carried out organizational rectification and education. In February and March, due to impassable river routes, the workers again faced difficulties in their lives. The Federation of Trade Unions immediately seized the opportunity to conduct further education, starting with a profound self-criticism at the meeting of Party members and cadres, breaking their old mindset of relying solely on portering for a living, and implementing production education. Only then did they begin to realize the importance of organizing production. The state-owned Longchang Store located in the village then lent them some funds, and they organized a mill to grind flour.

　　After the mill started operating, it met the needs of the local people by selling flour at lower prices than the market, so there were many customers. It ground one stone of grain every day, selling out as soon as it was ground. Later, they added another millstone (for a total of two) and built four milling rooms. The lives of the sixty-eight workers were thus guaranteed. Through practical experience, their enthusiasm for expanding reproduction was greatly stimulated. The workers did not spend the money they earned, but saved it all to develop production. Last spring, after the river opened in April, they bought a boat and started river transportation. By the time it froze over last winter, they had earned one million yuan. In early summer, they planted sixty mu of rice and three mu of vegetable gardens, harvesting over seven thousand jin of rice. In addition to eating the vegetables themselves, they sold a large portion. During the autumn harvest, they drew manpower and animal power to help the people with the autumn harvest and threshing, and also took the time to cut wild grass. Including the compensation received for helping with the work, they obtained a total of more than 19,000 jin of rice straw. After winter came, they repaired thirty-five ice sleds and started ice transportation; they also cut 10,000 blocks of ice, ready to sell this summer. In the twelfth lunar month, they partnered with the village market committee to build seven rooms with the profits from production, opened a large cart inn, which was very well managed and made a profit of 10,000 yuan in one month, and now they have set up a branch inn. As a result, their lives have improved.

　　端村码头工人搭伙集资生产
    【冀中电讯】安新端村水上码头工会，经过冀中职工会教育与整顿组织，开展了各种生产，生活得到改善。该村在土地改革前，东西两头有两个水上工会，共有工人六十八人，靠扛脚维持生活。在冬春河冻或运货少时，即凑伙吃吃喝喝，或赌博，也不组织其他生产。前年土地改革时，冀中职工会了解到上述情况，则抓紧对他们进行生产节约、建立家务的教育。开始他们认为人多心不齐，组织不起来。后经职工会几次的教育，他们才种了十亩稻子。收粮后，大家即分着吃了，也没有开展起生产。去春结合土改工作，职工会与该村贫农团取得意见一致，把两个工会合并，加强统一领导，并进行了整顿组织与教育。计二、三月间，因河路不通，工人生活又发生困难。职工会当即抓紧再次进行教育，首先在党员干部会上进行深刻检讨，打破了他们专靠扛脚维持生活的旧思想，贯彻了生产教育，这时他们才开始对组织生产有了觉悟，设在该村的国营隆昌商店，即借予他们一部资金，组织起来了一个磨房，开始磨面。
    磨房开工以后，适应当地群众的需要，实行低于市价卖面，因此顾主很多，每天磨粮一石，都是磨完卖光。后又添了一盘磨（共两盘磨）盖了四间磨房，六十八个工人的生活，从此得到保障。经过实际体验，大大刺激了他们扩大再生产的情绪，工人挣了钱也不花了，都积存起来开展生产。去春四月开河后，又买了一只船，开展河运。到去冬结冻时，已赚洋一百万元，夏初又种了六十亩稻子，三亩菜园子，收稻七千余斤。菜蔬除去自吃外，还卖出一大部。秋收时抽出了人力畜力，助民秋收打场，并抽空割野草，连同帮工所得酬劳，共得稻草一万九千余斤。入冬以后，收拾起来三十五辆冰床子，开展了冰上运输；又拉了一万块冰，准备今夏卖。腊月里把生产中所得利润与该村集市委员会搭伙盖了七间房，开了一个大车栈，经营的很好一个月即得利一万元，现又设了一个分栈。因此生活得到改善。
