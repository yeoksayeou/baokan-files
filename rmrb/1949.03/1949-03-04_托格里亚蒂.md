　　Many foreign journalists who have visited Togliatti in Rome usually say that he seems like a scholar. Yes, he can be said to be a scholar. This is not because he graduated from the University of Turin with excellent grades and obtained a doctorate in linguistics and philosophy, but because he has consciously dedicated his life—Togliatti is now fifty-four years old—to making the doctrines of Lenin-Stalin the property of the Italian working class and working people, and successfully applying them to practice. He went through the rigorous school of proletarian revolution and lived in Fascist prisons. Although he is often busy solving major political problems, he considers compiling the works of Lenin and Stalin into Italian to be his most important task.

　　Togliatti is a knowledgeable person because he is a great revolutionary. A true revolutionary, an organizer of millions of people, cannot but be a knowledgeable person. Togliatti's audience is not limited by the walls of the auditorium. In the squares of Rome, Milan, Turin, and Naples, millions of people can hear his voice, and millions of readers can read his fiery articles in the Communist Party's publications.

　　Togliatti is an Italian patriot and also a proletarian internationalist. The enemies do not understand this, just as they do not understand the great shift that all mankind is now turning to communism. In every lengthy speech, he enthusiastically talks about Russia—the country that has victoriously realized socialism—and about Stalin. He often reminds the Italian people that only by being friendly with the Soviet Union can they guarantee true independence and sovereignty, and only then can they move forward along the path of true progress.

　　On October 10, three days before Togliatti's assassination, when the Italian parliament was discussing the ratification of the Italian-U.S. agreement signed under the "Marshall Plan," the reactionary representatives who occupied the majority of the parliament tried their best to show indifference and disregard for the speeches of the spokespersons of the democratic progressive camp. They openly stated that no matter how much opposition there was here to surrendering to U.S. imperialism, and no matter how correct and reasonable this opposition was, it would not shake their opinion. But Togliatti finally stirred up this "dead swamp" of the government majority. His opening remarks had already attracted their attention. Togliatti said that the democratic camp headed by the Soviet Union is fighting for peace, progress, and democracy. Some people want to turn Italy into a military camp for anti-Soviet wars. When Togliatti said the following words amid the thunderous applause of the leftist representatives, the representatives who occupied the majority in the parliament showed panic and were in complete chaos.

　　Togliatti said: "We communists are extremely hostile to that kind of hasty and indifferent attitude. When we talk about war, we know that we are talking about a serious matter, and we also know what our responsibilities are. Today, our responsibility is to call on all the Italian people to fight for Italy, for Europe, and for world peace. This is also the purpose of our struggle today. But if tomorrow our country truly embarks on the road of war, then we also know what our responsibilities are. Now, the answer to imperialist war is for all the people to rise up and defend peace, independence, and the future of the country."

　　Togliatti is one of the greatest activists of modern times. He is an excellent orator, a famous political commentator, and a brilliant strategist. His greatness lies in his infinite loyalty to the cause of socialism, the cause of Lenin and Stalin, in his boundless confidence in the power of the working class, and in his constant and close connection with the Party.

　　In February 1942, when Hitler and Mussolini were still proud of their victories, Togliatti wrote: "Fascist Italy is on the eve of collapse." Togliatti pointed out that Mussolini's linking of Italy's fate with that of German imperialism was doomed to Italy's failure. He also pointed out that Italy's historical path is the path of friendship with Slavic countries. Togliatti made a profound analysis of the current situation in Italy. When some people thought that the Italian working class had been completely destroyed and strangled, Togliatti still appealed to the Italian working class.

　　Togliatti wrote: "Just as they need bread, air, and the sun, the Italian working class needs to enable all advanced elements in the domestic large and small enterprises and in the agricultural proletariat to eliminate the mood of passivity and waiting, and immediately use all their energy and all their strength to restore the anti-fascist secret organization, because this organization is able to restore, organize and guarantee the leadership of the broad mass movement of the urban and rural proletariat."

　　In the article "The Crisis of the Italian Fascist Ruling Upper Class," published in April 1943, he foresaw that Mussolini's doomsday was approaching. He once again called on the Italian workers to become the vanguard of the entire nation and the entire country in the battle against the heinous fascist tyranny.

　　In 1944, Togliatti returned to Italy. The old communists—guerrilla leaders, secret workers, and former prisoners in Fascist prisons—united closely with him. Where did Togliatti start? He began to gather the strength of the Party and began to build a broad mass-based working-class party. He believed that this was the fundamental foundation of the Party. Time was running out. When the struggle of the Soviet army to completely smash the Fascists was intensifying, Togliatti organized the masses to participate in the anti-fascist war. But he never forgot the most important task of building the Party for a minute.

　　When the fruit was ripe and the real harvest season began, British and American troops occupied Italy, and they did not allow the Italian working class and laborers to implement any serious social and economic reforms. The land in the south remained in the hands of the landlords, and the enterprises still belonged to the Fascist business owners.

　　The situation did not change after the war. The U.S. occupation forces, which tried every means to obstruct the anti-fascist democratic movement of the masses, continued to stay in Italy. But the Communist Party grew stronger, with more than one million members. This number continued to grow and has now reached more than two million. Togliatti used every means to assist the anti-fascist movement of the masses. He tried his best to consolidate the unity of the working class. The united front between the Socialist and Communist parties, which had been formed long before the war, is now even more consolidated. Togliatti entered the cabinet. As a result, U.S. imperialists, domestic reactionaries, and the Vatican strengthened their struggle against the Communist Party. They removed the communists from the cabinet organization at the request of U.S. reactionaries. The Socialists also withdrew from the cabinet along with the Communists. At this time, the number of communists had exceeded two million. There were seven million employees participating in the Italian General Confederation of Labor.

　　Loyal to the doctrines of Lenin and Stalin, Togliatti is fighting to consolidate the worker-peasant alliance and to establish a broad people's democratic front.

　　The scene of the struggle between the People's Democratic Front and the international reactionaries in the parliamentary elections in April this year is still vivid in my mind. At that time, all domestic and foreign reactionary forces armed themselves to oppose the Italian democrats. Togliatti led the Party and the People's Democratic Front into the battle against the reactionaries, and he fought tirelessly. In those days, millions of people heard Togliatti's lectures, which hit the enemy's vital points, were full of firepower, and were full of revolutionary enthusiasm. Every one of his speeches hit Gasperi and Interior Minister Shellba, denouncing their despicable and shameless "American-style" election laws, insisting that this election was to distort the will of the people.

　　Even the enemy cannot but admit Togliatti's great talents in all aspects. British and American journalists call Togliatti the most capable leader in modern Italy.

　　One day, under the starry sky—the editor of the U.S. "Saturday Evening Post" wrote in the magazine published on January 17, 1948—I heard Togliatti lecture to 30,000 people densely packed in the old square of Rome. His voice spread to every corner of the square through the loudspeaker. That voice was so melodious, passionate, calm, and pleasant to hear. Needless to say, Togliatti is now an excellent speaker in Italy. ... Togliatti's very logical arguments attracted everyone's attention, even those who could not accept his opinions. This time, when he said that Italy's largest political party—the Christian Democratic Party—is working for millions of dollars, and said that "this Christian emblem is no longer the image of Christ being crucified, but a cross carried by the people!" the audience immediately responded with warm applause.

　　Another American journalist wrote about Togliatti in the March 1948 issue of "Prospects": "Many people believe that he is not only the highest political wisdom in Western Europe, but also in the entire Italy." This reporter said that he had seen Togliatti at a very close distance, saying that he was a very majestic man. In fact, Togliatti is a man of ordinary stature, but he does seem to be intimidating to those who fear him.

专栏：

　　托格里亚蒂
    米洛夫  
    许多在罗马访问过托格里亚蒂的外国记者，通常都说他好象一个学者。是的，他也可以说是一个学者。这样说，并不是因为他毕业于都灵大学，成绩优良，获得了语言学、哲学博士的头衔，而是因为他将自己的一生——托氏现年五十四岁——自觉地贡献于使列宁——斯大林底学说成为意大利工人阶级与劳动人民的财产，并顺利地将它运用于实际。他经过了严峻的无产阶级革命的学校，住过法西斯牢狱。虽然他经常忙于解决重大的政治问题，但他们认为将列宁、斯大林底著作编译成意大利文是自己最重要的任务。
    托格里亚蒂之所以是一个学识渊博的人，因为他是一个伟大的革命家。一位真正的革命家，一个千百万群众的组织者不可能不是一个学识渊博的人。托格里亚蒂的听众并不受礼堂墙壁的限制，在罗马、米兰、都灵、那不勒斯的广场上千千万万的人都可以听见他的声音，千百万读者都可在共产党的刊物上读到他火热的文章。
    托格里亚蒂是一个意大利的爱国者，同时也是一个无产阶级的国际主义者。敌人不了解这一点，正如他们不了解现在全人类都转向共产主义这一伟大转变一样。在每一次长篇演说中，他都带着热烈的讲述俄国——胜利地实现了社会主义的国家——，谈论斯大林。他经常叮咛意大利人民，只有与苏联友好，才能保证真正的独立主权，才能沿着真正进步的道路前进。
    十月十日，在托格里亚蒂遇刺前三天，在意大利国会中讨论根据“马歇尔计划”所签订之美意协定的批准问题时，占国会大多数的反动派代表竭力对民主进步阵营发言人的讲话表示冷谈与无视。他们公开表示，不管这里如何反对向美帝国主义投降，也不管这种反对意见如何正确与合理，反正是不能动摇他们的意见的。但托格里亚蒂终于搅动了这一政府多数的“死池沼”。他开头几句话就已经引起了他们的注意。托格里亚蒂说，以苏联为首的民主阵营正在为和平，为进步与民主而斗争。有些人想把意大利变成反苏战争的屯兵场。当托格里亚蒂在左倾代表雷动般的掌声中说到下面几句话时，在国会中占多数的代表们便表示惊慌失措，混乱一团。
    托氏说道：“我们共产党人对于那种草率与漠不关心的态度是极端仇视的。当我们说到战争的时候，我们知道，我们正在说道一件严重的事情，我们也知道，我们的职责何在。今天我们的职责，就是号召全意大利人民为意大利、为欧洲与全世界和平而斗争。这也就是我们今天斗争的目的。但是，如果明天我们的国家真正走上了战争的道路，那末我们也知道，我们的职责何在。现在对于帝国主义战争的回答，就是全体人民站起，保卫和平、独立与末来的国家。”
    　　　　×　　　　　　　×　　　　　　　　×
    托格里亚蒂是现代最伟大的活动家之一。他是一个优秀的演说家，著名的政论家；英明的战备战略家。他的伟大，就在于他对于社会主义事业，列宁斯大林事业的无限忠诚，在于他对工人阶级力量充满无限信心，在于他同党保持着经常不同的联系。
    在一九四二年二月，当希特勒与墨索里尼尚以自己的胜利而骄傲时，托格里亚蒂即写道：“法西斯意大利已处在崩溃的前夕。”托氏曾指出墨索里尼将意大利的命运与德帝国主义命运联结在一起，这就注定了意大利的失败。又指出意大利的历史道路，就是与斯拉夫国家友好的道路。托格里亚蒂对意大利现况作了深刻的分析。当着有人认为意大利工人阶级已被彻底摧毁与绞杀了的时候，托格里亚蒂仍是诉诸意大利工人阶级的。
    托氏写道：“如象需要面包、空气、太阳一样，意大利工人阶级需要使国内各大小企业中的，农业无产阶级中的一切先进分子，排除消极等待的情绪，立即用全部精力，用一切力量恢复反法西斯的秘密组织，因为这一个组织是能够恢复、组织并保证领导城乡无产阶级广大群众运动的。”
    在一九四三年四月发表的“意大利法西斯统治上层的危机”一文中，他预见到墨索里尼的末日快到了。便再次向意大利工人号召，要他们在反对万恶的法西斯暴政的战斗中，成为整个民族、整个国家的先锋。
    一九四四年，托格里亚蒂返意。老共产党人——游击队的领导者，秘密工作者，过去法西斯监狱里的囚徒都与他紧密地团结了起来。托格里亚蒂从何处着手呢？他开始集合党的力量，着手建设广大群众性的工人阶级政党。他认为是党的根本基础。时不及待。当苏军彻底粉碎法西斯的斗争正在日益猛烈地开展时，托格里亚蒂则组织群众参加反法西斯战争。但他一分钟也没有忘记建党这件最重要的任务。
    当果子已熟，真正的收获期开始时，英、美军占领了意大利，他们不准意大利工人阶级与劳动者实行任何认真的社会、经济改革。南方的土地仍留在地主手里，企业仍属于法西斯企业主。
    战争结束以后，情况并没有改变。千方百计阻挠群众反法西斯民主运动的美占领军仍继续留住意国。但共产党壮大了，它已有一百万以上的党员。这一数字还在继续增长，现已达到二百余万。托氏用尽一切方法协助群众的反法西斯运动。尽力巩固工人阶级队伍的统一。远在战前即已组成的社共两党统一阵线，现在更加巩固了。托氏进入内阁。于是美帝国主义分子、国内反动派、梵蒂冈便加强其反对共产党的斗争。他们根据美国反动派的要求将共产党人自内阁组织退出去。社会党人也与共产党人一起退出内阁。此时共产党的数量业已超过二百万。参加意大利全国劳动总同盟之职工已有七百万。
    忠实于列宁、斯大林学说的托格里亚蒂，正在为巩固工农联盟、为建立广泛的人民民主阵线而斗争。
    人民民主阵线与国际反动派在今年四月国会选举中的斗争情景，现在尤历历在目。那时一切国内外反动势力都武装起来反对意大利民主派。托格里亚蒂领导党与人民民主阵线进入反对反动派的战斗，他不疲倦地战斗着。在那些日子里，千百万人都听到了托格里亚蒂命中敌人要害的，充满火力、充满革命热情的讲演。他的每篇讲演都打到了加斯贝利与内政部长谢尔巴身上，斥责他们卑鄙无耻的“美国式”的选举法，硬说这种选举乃是为了歪曲人民的意志。
    连敌人也不能不承认，托格里亚蒂底各方面的巨大才能。英、美新闻记者称托氏为现代意大利最有能力的首领。
    有一天，星夜里——美国“星期六晚邮报”主编在一九四八年一月十七日出版的该杂志中写道——我听到托格里亚蒂向三万密集在罗马城旧广场的群众讲演。他的声音通过扩音器传播到广场的每个角落，那声音是如此的悠扬、热情、镇定而悦耳。不用说，托格里亚蒂是现在意大利的一个出色的演讲家。……托格里亚蒂那些非常有逻辑的论证吸引了一切人的注意力，就连那些不能接受他的意见的人也不例外。这次，当他说到意大利最大的政党——基督教民主党——是为数百万美元而工作的，说到“这一基督教的教徽已不是基督受刑像，而是一个由人民背起来的十字架！”时，听众当即报以热烈的掌声。
    另外一个美国记者在一九四八年三月份的“展望”杂志上关于托格里亚蒂写道：“许多人都认为他令不是整个西欧的，也是整个意大利的最高的政治智慧。”这位记者说，他曾在距离很近的地方看见过托格里亚蒂，说他是个身材很雄伟的人。其实托格里亚蒂乃是一个普通身材的人，但看起来，他确实是令那些怕他的人们生畏的。
