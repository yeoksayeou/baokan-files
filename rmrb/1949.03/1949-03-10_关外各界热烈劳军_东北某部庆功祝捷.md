Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, March 8th: The Northeast Field Army, currently undergoing training in the Tianjin-Beijing area, has recently received a large number of慰问品 (consolation goods) and letters of sympathy from all circles outside the pass. The慰劳品 (consolation goods) have been distributed to all units of the army, and each comrade has received a white shirt, a bar of soap, a towel, and several packs of cigarettes. The commanders and fighters were greatly encouraged upon receiving the慰劳品 (consolation goods) and letters of sympathy. They gathered in groups of three or five, reading the instructions of their elders from their hometowns word by word; those who were illiterate asked others to read to them. One soldier, after putting on his snow-white shirt, said: "There must be stitches sewn by my mother and sister in this. I cannot wear it in vain; I must respond to the high expectations of the elders in the Northeast with action." The commanders and fighters of a certain unit jointly wrote a reply, in which they thanked the elders of the Northeast and guaranteed: 1. To maintain past glory, create new glory, and strive to be a good soldier of Chairman Mao; 2. To remember the pain the old society inflicted on the masses and never forget our roots; 3. To resolutely carry the revolution through to the end and liberate all of China.

Tangshan Dispatch: The first celebration and commendation conference of the Third Branch of the Logistics Department of the Northeast Field Army was held in Tangshan on the 20th of last month. In the five months since its establishment, the department completed the major tasks of supporting the final battles in the liberation of the entire Northeast and in 平 (Beijing), 津 (Tianjin), and 唐 (Tangshan). They loaded and unloaded more than 1,800 railcars of supplies, transferred more than 3.1 million jin (1550 tons) by cart, and transferred more than 30 million jin (15000 tons) by truck. They completed the tasks of receiving and transferring seriously wounded and sick soldiers, managing more than 20,000 civilian laborers, more than 4,600 stretchers, and more than 1,280 carts, and hosted more than 4,200 passing soldiers. In carrying out their tasks, all units demonstrated a high level of work efficiency in extremely difficult circumstances. A certain unit at the Seventh Major Station, during the autumn offensive transportation, was constantly bombed by enemy aircraft. The transportation comrades defended against air raids during the day and rushed to transport supplies at night. They only needed four days to travel back and forth on the 800-li (400 km) transport line. The Eighth and Ninth Major Stations sometimes set up stations a few miles away from the enemy, truly achieving "the supply moves forward as the troops move forward." Medical staff members did not sleep for several days and nights during the Tianjin-Tangshan campaign, feeding the wounded, giving them water, and cleaning up their waste. The guard units ensured the safety of supplies and agencies, so that no materials were lost or damaged. Cadres and staff members of the agencies personally participated in the handling of goods during the rush to unload and transfer supplies, managed and educated the civilian laborers, and appropriately organized the transportation manpower. Therefore, they were able to create records of unloading more than 50 railcars overnight, unloading an entire train in four hours and nineteen minutes, unloading a railcar of ammunition in fifteen to twenty minutes, unloading a railcar loaded with 540 bags of grain in fifty minutes, and loading a truck in seven minutes. In completing these tasks, all work units launched a campaign to establish merit, and 1,245 meritorious individuals emerged from the Third Branch, including 153 with major merit. Their active leadership in the work promoted the overall effort. The celebration and commendation conference lasted for three days. The leaders gave speeches and awarded prizes. The meritorious individuals exchanged experiences in establishing merit, and finally, enthusiastically launched challenges, encouraging each other not to be arrogant or complacent, to continue to work hard, and to strive for even greater merit.
