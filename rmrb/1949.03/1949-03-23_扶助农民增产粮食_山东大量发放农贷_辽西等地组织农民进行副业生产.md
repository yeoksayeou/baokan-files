Xinhua News Agency, East China, 20th. The various branches and sub-branches of the Beihai Bank in Shandong have recently decided to issue agricultural loans of more than 69.66 million jin of grain and 140,000 yuan of Beihai currency to support farmers in increasing grain production and producing industrial raw materials. The Lunan Branch of the Beihai Bank stipulates that the distribution steps should be based on the production season, first issuing loans for farm tools and draught cattle to meet the needs of spring plowing, then issuing seed loans, and finally issuing loans for hoes and some seeds to solve the difficulties of hoeing and replanting seedlings. The branch also aims to help local cooperatives establish credit departments by issuing loans. The Bohai Administrative Office also issued instructions stipulating that loans should first be used to solve the difficulties of promoting the planting of cotton, peanuts and other fertilizers and seeds. The instructions of the Jiaodong Administrative Office specifically pointed out that when issuing loans for draught animals, the amount of loans should be controlled in accordance with the market supply, so as to avoid panic buying and stimulate livestock prices. The Administrative Office also pointed out that spring loans should be combined with the clearing of old loans in order to enrich the funds for spring loans.

Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 20th. The democratic governments of the newly liberated areas of Liaoning, Western Liaoning, and Rehe provinces are organizing farmers to engage in sideline production in preparation for spring plowing. The Liaoyang County Government has sent work teams to disaster-stricken areas to distribute disaster relief grain loans and organize disaster victims to use the loans for production such as panning for gold, logging, charcoal burning, and fishing. With the help of the government, farmers in the suburbs of Yingkou City have organized 594 production groups to engage in salt transportation, fishing, firewood collection, and transportation, which has initially solved the livelihood problems of more than 27,000 people. Some farmers have also purchased livestock and other items, and are actively preparing for spring plowing. According to the characteristics of the developed textile industry in Xinhe and other places in Rehe Province, the People's Government has provided disaster victims with grain loans and cotton seed loans as spring plowing capital. Meanwhile, local cooperatives have lent 17,500 jin of cotton and 29 looms, mobilizing more than 20,700 women to participate in spinning and weaving. The counties in western Liaoning have universally mobilized disaster victims to weave mats and spin, and most of the disaster victims in the area have solved the problem of food for three to four months.
