　　Jilu Yu District Organs Production Meeting
    Criticizing Cadre-Merchant Mentality
    Determining New Management Policies
    [This newspaper's dispatch] The Jilu Yu Administrative Office convened a district-wide organs production store meeting on February 16th. Fifteen units attended, lasting for four days. The meeting conveyed the spirit of the North China People's Government and the Ministry of Industry and Commerce's decisions and instructions regarding organs production and examined the main deviations in past management, such as a singular focus on profit and unorganized phenomena of each acting on its own. During price fluctuations, there was a general lack of concern for price stabilization work, with instances of panic buying and competitive selling, weakening the leading role of the state-owned economy in the market and providing opportunities for private merchants to speculate. Although individual stores sold some materials, the impact was limited due to inconsistent actions.

    However, during discussions, some comrades still held unclear views or even resisted emotionally the implementation of the North China People's Government's decisions. Questions were raised such as "Restrictions on organs production are too strict," "There's not much industry to do," "There's nothing to manage in the future," and "Private individuals have freedom, why doesn't organs production have freedom?" In order to achieve a consensus in understanding, studies were conducted separately. It was pointed out that this was a reflection of a merchant mentality, failing to recognize that the correct management policy for organs production was not solely for the supply needs of the unit, but also to abide by government policies and laws, cooperate with the state-owned economy, oppose speculation and manipulation, and strive for the economic construction of the New Democracy. After criticism and education, everyone recognized the importance of earnestly implementing the North China People's Government's decisions. Regarding the future management policies for organs production: To carry out agricultural, sideline, and handicraft production, it was decided that special commissioner's offices and above could operate industries. Existing stores would not be cancelled for the time being, nor could new stores be established. It is imperative that government laws and regulations be followed, accepting guidance from industrial and commercial trade organs, jointly opposing the manipulation and hoarding of speculative merchants, and supporting cooperatives. The three commodities of grain, cotton, and oil currently held should all be handed over to state-owned stores (except for those entrusted by state-owned stores). Stores outside the North China region should be immediately withdrawn. Those that cannot be withdrawn in time should immediately cease operations and begin liquidation. It was determined that organs stores should conduct exchanges of agricultural and industrial products under the leadership of state-owned commerce. To strengthen the management and leadership of organs production, unified organizational structures would be established. The administrative office would establish a general manager's office, the special commissioner's offices would establish manager's offices, and the Puyang, Heze, and Liaocheng would establish organs production management committees, all under the leadership of industrial and commercial departments. The personnel supplies of all organs production units in each district would be paid by the respective stores.

　　冀鲁豫区机关生产会议
    批判干部商人意识
    确定新的经营方针
    【本报讯】冀鲁豫行署于二月十六日召开了全区机关生产商店会议。到十五个单位，历时四天。会上传达了华北人民政府及工商部对机关生产的决定与指示的精神，并检查了以往经营中的主要偏向。如单纯利润观点，各自为政的无组织现象。在物价波动时，对物价平抑工作多漠不关心，抢购争售，削弱了国营经济在市场上的领导作用，给私商以投机空隙。虽有个别商店出售一部物资，又因步调不一，结果作用不大。
    但在讨论中，个别同志对执行华北人民政府决定思想上仍有不少糊涂观念，甚或在情绪上对抗。如提出“对机关生产限制太严”、“工业没啥办”、“今后没啥经营”、“私人有自由，为啥机关生产没自由”等问题。为了求得认识上的一致，分别进行了研究。指出这是商人意识的反映，没有认识到机关生产的正确经营方针，不单是为了本单位的供给问题，并应遵守政府的政策法令，配合国营经济，反对投机操纵，为新民主主义的经济建设而努力。经过批判教育之后，大家认识到认真执行华北人民政府决定的重要性。关于今后机关生产的经营方针：为进行农业、副业、手工业生产，决定专署以上可以办工业，已设之商店，暂不取消，亦不能再设新店，必须遵守政府法令，接受工商贸易机关的指导，共同反对投机商人的操纵囤积，扶助合作社。对现存的粮棉油三种商品，统交国营商店（国营商店委托者除外）。华北区以外之商店马上撤回，如不能及时撤回者，应立即停止营业，进行结束。确定机关商店应在国营商业的领导下，进行农产品和工业品交换。为加强机关生产管理和领导，建立统一组织机构。行署设总经理处，专署设经理处，濮阳、菏泽、聊城成立机关生产管理委员会，均由工商部门领导。各该区所有机关生产单位人员供给由各商店开支。
