Price Dynamics in Beiping City

　　Increased Grain Supply Weakens Grain Prices
　　Recently, grain prices have generally shown a trend of stability and weakness. This is because the supply of grain from outside the city has gradually increased, and the profits are very large. Grain from Zhangjiakou can earn about 180 yuan per dou (a unit of dry volume) for wheat and more than 80 yuan per dou for millet. According to some merchants, some brokers in the city are using scales to shortchange outside vendors, which should be stopped immediately.

　　Abundant Supply of Sundries Benefits Citizens
　　Recently, the prices of general merchandise have generally shown a downward trend. This is mainly due to the decline in grain prices. Secondly, there is an increase in goods from outside the city. For example, Tongshengxiang transported more than 200 boxes of soap from Tianjin the other day, and a large quantity of sesame oil and white oil was transported from Gaobeidian in Zhuoxian County, so prices have weakened, falling by three to four yuan per jin (a unit of weight) or more. The price of white sugar has also fallen by three yuan per jin.

　　平市物价动态　
    外来粮增加粮价呈疲落
    近日来粮价均现平疲，原因是外来粮食逐渐增多，且利润甚大，张家口来粮，小麦每斗可赚一百八十元左右，小米每斗可赚八十余元。据一些商贩反映，本市若干牙纪时用秤克扣外来小贩，应即予以制止。
    杂货来源富　市民好处多
    日来杂货一般都显疲落。主要是因为粮价下落的原故，其次是外来货物增多，如前日同升祥由津运来肥皂二百余箱，涿县高碑店运来大批香油、白油，故价疲落，每斤落价三至四元不等。白糖每斤亦落三元。
