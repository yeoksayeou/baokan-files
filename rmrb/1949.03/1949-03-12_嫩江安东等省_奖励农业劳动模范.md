　　Nenjiang, Andong and Other Provinces
　Reward Agricultural Labor Models
    [Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 1st] From January 5th to February 15th, the four provinces of Nenjiang, Hejiang, Heilongjiang, and Andong in the Northeast Liberated Area successively convened provincial agricultural labor model conferences, rewarding 1,774 model labor farmers. At the labor model conferences held in each province, many model labor farmers who were skilled in intensive farming, water conservancy construction, pest control, and exchanging labor for plowing reported various production experiences and announced their plans to lead farmers in their villages and townships to increase production this year. The provincial committees of the Chinese Communist Party and the provincial people's governments respectively sent personnel to the conferences to explain various policies related to agricultural production. The above-mentioned conferences in the four provinces have now concluded successfully, and the agricultural labor model conferences in other provinces, such as Songjiang, Jilin, and Liaobei, are also about to be convened.
