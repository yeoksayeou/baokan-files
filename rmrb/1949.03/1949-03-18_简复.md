　　Brief Replies

　　To Mr. Chen Zixin: Working in the puppet police bureau in the past does not necessarily mean being a secret agent. You can talk in detail about your past situation at the Public Security Bureau. If registration is required, then proceed with it without any worries. Doing so will be of great convenience to your future livelihood.

　　To Mr. Chen Lin: The People's Bank of China has recently organized a cooperative bank to handle industrial and commercial loans, which will begin operations soon. Detailed measures will be announced by this newspaper. If you need a loan, please pay attention to the announcements. The address is at the former Farmers Bank site on Dongjiaomin Lane.

　　To Mr. Wang Shaolun: What is your level of education and work skills? What kind of school is suitable for you to apply to and what kind of work is suitable for you to do? None of these were stated in your letter, so it is impossible to give a specific reply.

　　To Messrs. Yan Yi, Wang Hui, and Zhang Yongzhi: In the past, you were young people who were out of school and unemployed. After the liberation of Beiping, you are willing to enter school as soon as possible. Now, both North China University and the North China University Art Cadre Training Class have begun enrollment. You can go there to register and take the entrance examination. See the advertisement column in the Beiping edition of the People's Daily for details on the enrollment brochure.

　　To Mr. Li Yongfu: A People's Liberation Army soldier who received education in the officers' training regiment, and who cannot return home due to severe stomach illness, can register his household at a friend's house and stay for recuperation.

　　To Mr. Yang Dingyuan: Kuomintang officers and soldiers, whether currently employed or on extended leave, who are willing to resign and return to their hometowns, are permitted by the People's Government. You can register with the local government. As long as you abide by government laws and do not engage in counter-revolutionary activities, the government will not discriminate against you. Conversely, if you still engage in counter-revolutionary activities, the government will severely punish you without leniency. If your home is in the countryside, and you are willing to participate in agricultural labor and have no other occupation, you can apply to the local farmers' association and receive a share of land like the peasants.

　　To Mr. Wu Jing: Regarding the questions about whether the democratic government allows free love, and whether there will be legal sanctions if the other party is abused or framed by their parents, the brief replies are as follows:

　　The marriage system stipulated by the People's Government is a completely independent monogamous system for men and women, and resolutely opposes the feudal marriage system. For example, parental arrangements and monetary transactions. The government naturally allows young men and women to freely love.

　　In addition, if one party is abused or framed by their parents in order to fight for personal marriage autonomy, as long as that person files a complaint with the government, the democratic government can handle it according to law.

　　简复
    陈自新君：过去在伪警察局工作，并不一定就是特务。关于你过去的情况，可以到公安局去详细谈谈，如需要登记，就去进行登记，不必存在什么顾虑。这样做对于你今后的谋生，有很大便利。
    陈林君：中国人民银行为办理工商贷款，最近组织了一个合作银行，不日即开始营业，详细办法将由本报公布。你如贷款，请注意查看。行址在东交民巷原农民银行旧址。
    汪少伦君：你有何种文化程度与工作技能？适宜于投考什么学校与做何种工作？来信均未叙明，故无法做具体答复。
    颜毅、王惠、张永知君：过去你们是失学失业的青年，北平解放后愿意早日入学。现在华北大学与华北大学艺术干部训练班，均已开始招生，可以前去报名投考，招生简章详见人民日报北平版广告栏内。
    李永福君：在军官教导团受过教育的解放军人，因患严重胃病不能回家，可以在朋友家登记户口，暂住疗养。
    杨定远君：国民党军官兵，不管在职或已请准长假，愿意离职回乡，人民政府是允许的。可向当地政府办理登记手续。以后只要遵行政府法令，不再做反革命活动，政府即不会歧视他们。反之，若仍有反革命活动，政府将予严惩不贷。若家在乡村，自己愿意参加农业劳动，而无其他职业者，向当地农会申请后，可和农民一样分得一份土地。
    武静君：所问关于民主政府是否允许自由恋爱，以及如有对方被家长虐待，陷害，是否受法律制裁等问题，简复如下：
    人民政府所规定的婚姻制度是男女婚姻完全自主的一夫一妻制，坚决反对封建的婚姻制度。例如：父母包办，金钱买卖等。对青年男女的自由恋爱，政府自然允许。
    另外，如果有一方为了争取个人婚姻自主，而遭到家长的虐待或陷害，只要其本人向政府提出申诉，民主政府即可依法处理。
