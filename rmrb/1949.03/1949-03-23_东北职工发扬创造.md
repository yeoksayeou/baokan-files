Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 20th: Northeast workers have recently made many innovations in industrial technology:
	(1) Guo Jinshan, Yang Shuquan and other five workers from the sand casting group of the Third Branch of the Shenyang No. 1 Machine Tool Plant have converted the special drying furnace, which used to burn coke, to burn coal dust, which is 95% cheaper than burning coke. In terms of time, it used to take 15 hours to burn a furnace, but now it takes 7 and a half hours.
	(2) Guan Heqing, an electrical technician at the shoe-cutting factory of the Third Bureau of the Quartermaster Department, has developed a method of cutting shoe soles with electricity. One machine can cut 250 pairs per hour, which is equal to the amount of work done by ten people in one day in the past. Li Zhenping and other workers from the knitting factory of the same bureau transformed the original manual towel weaving machine into an electric towel weaving machine. Each machine can weave 90 to 100 towels per day, which is about twice the output of a manual towel weaving machine.
	(3) Li Gui, a worker at the Boketu locomotive section of the Qiqihar Railway Bureau, successfully developed an "automatic oil injector" that can automatically send oil when the water pump is running and stop the oil pump when the water pump stops, saving a lot of oil. In the past, each water supply station along the railway line had to use 4.5 taels of oil for every 100 tons of water supplied, while the automatic oil injector only used 2.25 taels of oil for every 100 tons of water supplied, saving half of the oil compared to before.
	(4) Ren Zhankui, a worker in the electromechanical section of the Fuxin Coal Mine, made an electric Kesi pliers, which can cut off No. 8 iron wire and can replace Japanese-made products.
	(5) After Zhou Tailing, a worker at the Fushun Coal Mine Lamp Factory, successfully created a model for the lamp head reflector and a model for the rubber pad, the output of the lamp head reflector increased from 200 per day to 1,000, and the rubber pad increased from 500 per day to 1,500.

　　东北职工发扬创造
    【新华社沈阳二十日电】东北职工最近在工业技术方面有不少创造：
    （一）沈阳第一机器厂三分厂翻沙组工友郭金山、杨树泉等五人，将一向烧焦炭之特制干燥炉改装为烧煤屑，价格较烧焦炭便宜百分之九十五。在时间上原先烧一炉需十五小时，现则需七时半。
    （二）军需部三局切鞋厂电工技师关贺卿研究出电力切鞋底的方法，每小时一架机器可切二百五十双，等于过去十个人工作一天的数量。该局针织厂工友李镇屏等将原用之人力织巾机改造成电力织巾机。每台机器每天可织巾九十条至一百条，较人力织巾机产量提高约一倍。
    （三）齐齐哈尔铁路局博克图机务段工友李贵研制“自动注油器”成功，能使水泵转动时油泵自动送油，水泵停止时油泵也停止，省油很多。以往该铁路沿线各给水站每上一百吨水须用四点五两油，而自动注油器每上百吨水仅用油二点二五两，可较前省油一半。
    （四）阜新煤矿机电股工人任占奎制成电器克丝钳子，该钳子能切断八号铁线，可代替日本制造品。
    （五）抚顺煤矿矿灯厂工友周太令创制灯头反射器模型和胶皮垫模型成功后，灯头反射器的产量由每天二百个增至一千个，胶皮垫由每天五百个增至一千五百个。
