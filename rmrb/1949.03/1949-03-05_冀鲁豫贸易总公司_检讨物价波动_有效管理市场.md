　　Jiluyu Trade Corporation
  　Reviews Price Fluctuations
    Effectively Manages the Market
  　Several Concrete Measures
    [Jiluyu Electric] The Jiluyu Trade Corporation reviewed the issue of price fluctuations and formulated specific measures to stabilize prices, preparing sufficient materials to supply the market and strictly preventing manipulation by speculative merchants. In the price fluctuations of the past month, in addition to objective reasons, serious weaknesses in our trade work were exposed: First, insufficient attention and research were given to the activities of speculative private capital and the development and changes in the market, so effective measures could not be proposed in a timely manner when prices fluctuated. Second, price controls were not unified; there was no unified leadership and close coordination in organization, administration, banking, and trade. After the abolition of various market exchanges, the market management committee did not take timely control of the markets, resulting in a laissez-faire phenomenon. Third, during the period of price fluctuations, our public stores failed to stabilize prices and even engaged in profiteering, demonstrating serious disorganization and indiscipline. Fourth, at the beginning of price fluctuations, the leadership overestimated objective difficulties, underestimated subjective forces, and believed that price fluctuations were insurmountable under such circumstances, thus abandoning subjective efforts, which prolonged the fluctuation time. Our trade corporation has conducted a comprehensive review of the above issues. In order to stabilize prices, stabilize the lives of the broad masses, and ensure this year's large-scale production campaign, we have formulated the following specific measures in conjunction with other relevant departments under the unified leadership of the administrative office: First, state-owned economic organs must regularly study market supply and demand changes, adjust materials, and prevent drastic price increases and decreases. Second, banking work must strictly implement the General Bank's Order No. 1. Branches and county sub-branches in various cities must first meet the needs of state-owned and public enterprises in their lending business. If there are surplus funds, they should be provided to the trade corporation and its affiliated stores for material adjustment and price stabilization. Public stores should deposit any surplus funds in the People's Bank, and both parties should maintain their credit. Loans to speculative merchants are strictly prohibited, otherwise, responsibility will be investigated. Private industrial, commercial, and transportation enterprises that are beneficial to the national economy and the people's livelihood may be supported as appropriate. During price fluctuations, all commercial loans should be suspended. Third, strengthen administrative management, and constantly understand the activities of speculative merchants, especially during periods of price instability. Strictly prevent their speculative manipulation. Those who are not grain merchants or private banks who illegally sell or hoard grain shall be punished or confiscated. Fourth, financial work should effectively cooperate with economic work, such as providing various conveniences for grain exchange, transfer, allocation, and borrowing based on market conditions. Fifth, concentrate efforts to take unified action and strictly manage the market. Financial and economic departments at all levels should closely cooperate, with the government taking the lead in organizing forces in a unified manner, convening meetings, formulating plans for unified action, and forming a special inspection team by the industry and commerce departments and banks to conduct inspections and sanction speculative and manipulative illegal elements. In the implementation of this regulation, all organs, production units, and stores must cooperate with public industrial and commercial departments to jointly complete the task. Sixth, study the Xinhua News Agency's editorial "The Linqing Incident" to examine our work. Improve policy viewpoints and overcome blindness and disorganization and indiscipline in our work.

　　冀鲁豫贸易总公司
  　检讨物价波动
    有效管理市场
  　几项具体办法
    【冀鲁豫电】冀鲁豫贸易公司检讨物价波动问题，并拟定平稳物价的具体措施，准备充足物资供应市场，并严防投机商人的操纵。上月物价波动中，除了客观原因外，暴露了我贸易工作业务上的严重弱点：一、对投机私人资本的活动，及市场的发展变化注意和研究不够，因而在物价动荡时，不能及时提出有效措施。二、对物价管制不统一，在组织上、行政上、银行、贸易均没有统一的领导和密切配合，各集市交易所取消后，集市管理委员会没有及时的把集市掌握起来，形成自流现象。三、物价波动时期，我公营商店未能平抑物价，甚而竟有趁火打劫，表现了严重的无组织无纪律现象。四、物价波动初期，领导思想上因为过多的看到客观的困难，对主观的力量估计不足，认为物价波动在此种情况下，是不可克服的困难，因而放弃了主观努力，以致延长了波动时间。以上问题，我贸易公司已经进行了全面检查。为了平抑物价，稳定广大群众生活，保障今年的大生产运动，特联合其他有关部门，在行署统一领导下，作出如下的具体措施：一、国营经济机关要经常研究市场供求变化，调剂物资，防止物价的暴涨暴跌。二、银行工作必须严格执行总行第一号指示，各城市之办事处、县支行，在放款业务中，首先要满足国营公营企业的需要，若有余款应供给贸易公司及所属之商店进行物资调剂，平稳物价。公营商店，如有余款亦应存于人民银行，双方互守信用。对投机商人严禁贷款，否则追究责任。对有利于国计民生私营工商运输事业，可酌情予以扶持。在物价波动时，应停止一切商业贷款。三、加强行政管理工作，对投机商人，应经常了解其活动，特别在物价不稳时要严防其投机操纵，对平时并非粮商，或者是私人银号等，如有盗卖囤积粮食者，要予以处分或没收。四、财政工作与经济工作要有力配合，如粮食之兑调拨借，根据市场情况予以各种便利等。五、集中力量统一行动，对市场进行严格的管理，各级财经部门要作到密切的配合，由政府为主统一组织力量，召开会议，制定计划统一行动，并由工商部门与银行组成专门检查小组，进行检查，与制裁投机操纵违法分子。在执行此规定中，各机关生产商店，必须同样协同各公营工商部门共同完成任务。六、学习新华社社论“临清事件”的文章，来检查工作。提高政策观点，克服盲目性和工作中的无组织无纪律现象。
