　　Female Workers of the Daxing Cotton Mill and the Problem of Female Workers
　　Dai Xinmin

　　(1) The Daxing Cotton Mill has 566 female employees, accounting for 35.8% of all employees; among them, 557 are female workers, accounting for 37.9% of all workers (the newly established cloth factory's machines are not fully operational, so the statistics are not precise). Among the female workers, 490 are spinning and winding female workers, 39 are weaving female workers, and 23 are carpet-making female workers (some are general workers in the carpet factory). The vast majority of female workers are in the spinning and winding shifts. Female spinning workers account for 54.4% of all spinning workers, and female workers play a decisive role in spinning and winding production. The focus of the cotton mill's female workers is also on the spinning and winding shifts. Therefore, the following discussion mainly concerns the situation of female spinning and winding workers.

　　(2) This time, 90 model workers were selected from the spinning and winding shifts, of which 57 were female workers, accounting for 64% of all model workers. The proportion is greater than the proportion of female workers to all spinning workers. They indeed have many outstanding deeds:

　　(1) During the red flag competition, many female workers were afraid of delaying work, so they did not eat or drink water during their shifts (one meal during an eight-hour shift). Administratively, fearing that it would affect their health, they were dissuaded, but doffing worker Wei Xiangni said: "As soon as I see the yarn clumps on the machine, I forget about eating and drinking." Some female workers also ate dry food while watching the machines; some even hid during air raid alarms and secretly started the machines after people left; many female workers also came to the factory early on Sundays to try to start the machines early... In short, they thought of many ways to strive for more production. Although the methods are not necessarily good, they can illustrate their production enthusiasm.

　　(2) For the convenience of work, many female machine operators and doffers have also learned some simple machine repair techniques. Originally, if a spindle tape broke on the machine, a special spindle tape worker would come to tie it, but finding someone was never as convenient as doing it yourself. Breaking a spindle tape stops four spindles, which greatly affects production. Therefore, many female workers run to push the spindle tape car themselves when they see a spindle tape break; some female workers, like Hao Dongjie, don't look for spindle tape workers and learn to tie spindle tapes themselves; some female workers also learn to repair leather rollers, add spindle oil, leather roller oil...

　　(3) In the air of the cotton mill, many cotton fibers are always flying around. With hard work, the hair of female workers turns white. In the past, every shift, female workers always combed their hair and looked in the mirror several times, which greatly affected production. Since the start of the competition, led by Party members and Youth League members, this phenomenon has been completely overcome.

　　(4) Crying because they couldn't get the red flag, being so anxious that they couldn't eat or sleep... are all very common situations; some individuals were so anxious that they grew bumps on their necks.

　　(3) Generally, young female workers are enthusiastic about learning. Many female workers were illiterate before liberation, but now they can write some simple letters. Some female workers have recognized more than a thousand characters; some female workers can also understand newspapers. Once, more than a dozen workers were sent to the workers' school to study, and many workers followed behind, shouting, "Why don't you let me study?" The majority of them were female workers. One female worker even cried until her eyes were red.

　　(4) Due to their increased political awareness, many female workers actively requested to join the Party and the Youth League. Fifty-six female workers have already joined the Party. Among them, nine have been transferred to Tianjin to participate in takeover work, and two have participated in local women's work. Their enthusiasm has been consistently high.

　　(5) Because they participate in production and construction, their status in the family has also changed. Generally, they are treated better at home. Many female workers eat "small pot meals," and some mothers-in-law even make "small pot meals" for their daughters-in-law because their families feel sorry for their hard work.

However, in the work of female workers, there are many problems that deserve our attention and efforts to solve.

First, even today, many feudal things are still binding and suppressing them. Female workers do not have the right to dispose of the wages they earn from their labor. After marriage, everything belongs to the husband's family, and wages must also be handed over to the husband's family. Therefore, some female workers dare not marry because their families need them to earn a living; some female workers want to marry, but their families do not allow them to marry because of their own lives. Many are delayed until they are twenty-four or five and still cannot marry. Many who are already married are also in a dilemma because of this problem, and some dare not even give part of their year-end bonus to their own mothers. As for free love, it is even more restricted by public opinion and family. If two unmarried men and women are too close, they will be despised and discriminated against, and the family also restricts them very strictly. Due to these unreasonable environments, it is also easy for incorrect relationships between men and women to occur.

Second, many female workers look down on labor, thinking that labor is lowly, and even some female workers who are good at labor also have the same contempt for labor. For example, when it comes to marriage, many female workers are unwilling to marry workers (now it has improved somewhat), fearing that they will be female workers for the rest of their lives. The idea of "climbing up" and finding someone to "support them" is still quite common. They are also unwilling to marry farmers, thinking that they will work a lot and live a hard life.

Third, the health problems of female workers:

　　(1) Female workers in cotton mills are prone to lung diseases - mainly because the air is too bad, and cotton fibers fly everywhere. Wearing masks can solve it a bit, but there are difficulties, such as needing to use saliva to twist the ends of the yarn; eyelashes get water vapor (the water vapor from breathing is blocked by the mask and hangs upwards on the eyelashes), which sticks to cotton wool, which affects seeing things. Therefore, it has always been difficult to get everyone to wear masks. Improvements are currently being studied.

　　(2) Due to the bad air, many people grow bumps (lymph node tuberculosis). In addition, female workers are too narrow-minded and easily get anxious, and doctors say that this is also a major cause of growing bumps.

　　(3) Many also suffer from menstrual diseases because they know too little about hygiene and are very feudal. They are unwilling to talk about their illnesses, let alone see male doctors, which leads to more and more serious problems.

　　(4) Indigenous methods of midwifery also cause no small suffering to female workers, resulting in many cases of puerperal fever and neonatal tetanus.

　　(5) In the past, during the enemy puppet era, female workers started working at too young an age and stood for twelve hours, so many people have bent legs.

Fourth, the future of female workers: First of all, after giving birth, if there is no one at home to take care of the children, they cannot go to work, especially female workers with many children, who have to go home to raise their children. We are currently unable to establish nurseries and kindergartens. At the same time, female spinning workers over the age of thirty-five are clumsy and have difficulty working. How to change careers is also a problem.

The above only briefly talks about some situations and raises some problems. How to understand and solve them still needs to be carefully studied in the work.

　　大兴纱厂的女工和女工问题
    戴新民
    （一）大兴纱厂有五百六十六个女职工，占全体职工的百分之三十五点八；其中女工为五百五十七人，占全体工人的百分之三十七点九（新设布厂机器未开全，统计数字不够精确）。女工中，纺纱运转女工为四百九十人，织布女工为三十九人，织毯子女子工（有些是毯子厂杂工）为二十三人。女工绝大部分是在纺纱运转班。纺纱女工占全体纺纱工人的百分之五十四点四，纺纱运转的生产，女工是起有决定作用的。纱厂女工工作重点也就在纺纱运转班了，因而，这里谈的主要的是纺纱运转女工的情况。
    （二）这次纺纱运转班选了九十个模范工，其中五十七名为女工，占全体模范工的百分之六十四，比例数是大于女工与全体纺纱工人的比例的。她们确实有不少出色的事迹：
    ㈠在争红旗竞赛中，许多女工怕误工，班上不吃饭、不喝水（八小时班中吃一顿饭）。行政上怕影响她们健康，劝阻她们，落纱工魏香妮说：“我一看车上纱疙疸，我就忘记了吃喝。”也有的女工拿着干粮一面吃，一面看车；还有的女工在拉防空警报时藏起来，等人走后偷偷的开车；也有不少女工星期日提前来厂，争取早开车………总之，她们想了许多办法争取多生产。虽然办法不一定好，但却可以说明她们的生产情绪。
    ㈡、为了工作方便，不少看车与落纱的女工还学会了一些简单的修理机器的技术。本来，车上锭带断了，专有扎锭带工人来扎，但找人总不如自己方便，断一根锭带即停四个锭子，影响生产很大，因此许多女工见锭带一断，即自己跑去推锭带车子；也有女工如郝东姐，不找锭带工，自己学会扎锭带；还有女工学修皮辊，会加锭子油，皮辊油……
    ㈢、在纱厂空气中，总是飞舞着许多棉花，上班工夫大，女工头发就要变白；过去每一个班，女工总是要梳几回头发，照几回镜子，相当影响生产。发动竞赛以来，由党员、团员带头，这一现象竟完全克服。
    ㈣、竞赛中因得不上红旗而哭、而急得吃不下饭、睡不着觉，……都是很一般的情形；还有个别的急得脖子上长疙疸的。
    （三）一般的青年女工都热情要求学习，不少女工解放前一字不识，现在可以写一些简单的信了。有的女工已认到一千多字；有的女工还能看懂报纸。有一次，送十几个工人到职工学校学习，后面便跟着不少工人嚷：“为什么不叫我学习？”其中女工是占多数的。还有一个女工把眼睛都哭红了。
    （四）由于她们政治觉悟的提高，很多女工均积极的要求参加党和团。已经有五十六个女工参加了党。其中还有九个被调到天津参加接收工作，还有两个参加本市妇女工作。她们的情绪都一直很高。
    （五）由于他们参加生产建设，因而在家庭中的地位也有改变，一般在家是比较优待的，不少女工吃“小锅饭”，还有婆婆给媳妇做“小锅饭”的。因为家里人都心疼他们的工作太辛苦。
    但是，在女工工作中，有许多问题，是值得我们重视和设法解决的。
    首先是直到今天，仍有不少封建的东西在束缚和压制着她们。女工们对于自己劳动挣来的工资，自己无权支配。结婚后，就一切都是婆婆家的了，工钱也就要交婆家。因而有的女工由于娘家需要她赚钱生活不敢结婚；也有的女工要求结婚，娘家因顾及自己的生活，不叫她结婚。这样耽误到二十四、五尚不能结婚的很多。已经结婚的也有不少人因为这个问题而左右为难，有的连年终奖金也不敢分一部给自己的娘。至于自由恋爱更受到舆论和家庭的限制，两个未婚男女稍多接近，即会受到轻视和歧视，家庭也限制的很严。由于这种种不合理的环境，因而也容易发生些不正确的男女关系。
    第二，许多女工看不起劳动，认为劳动是下贱，甚至有些劳动好的女工也同样有轻视劳动的情形。比如谈到结婚问题，许多女工均不愿跟工人结婚（现在有些进步了），怕当一辈子女工，“向上爬”，找个人“养起自己来”的想法，还是很不少的。也不愿和农民结婚，认为劳动不少，生活又苦。
    第三，女工的健康问题：
    ㈠纱厂女工容易得肺病——主要的是空气太坏，棉花纤维到处飞，戴口罩可以解决一下，但有其困难，如接头要用唾液捻；眼毛挂水气（呼吸的水气因口罩挡住而向上挂到眼毛上），粘棉毛，以致影响看东西。因此叫大家戴口罩：一向很难发动，现正研究改善中。
    ㈡由于空气不好的关系，长疙疸的不少（淋巴结核）。另外女工气量太窄，好发急，抵抗力差，医生说这也是长疙疸的一个重大的原因。
    ㈢还有不少生月经病的，因为卫生常识懂得太少，又都很封建，得病不肯说，更不肯找男医生治，以致越拖越重的也不少。
    ㈣土法接生，也苦害女工不小，因而得产褥热与小孩四、六风的很多。
    ㈤过去敌伪时代，女工因年岁太小便上工，一站十二小时，所以很多人两条腿是弯的。
    第四，女工前途问题：首先生孩子后，如果家里无人带孩子，即无法上工，特别孩子多的女工，便只好回家抚育小孩。保育院、托儿所的组织当下还无力建立。同时，纺纱女工超过三十五岁手脚笨，干活很困难。如何转业，也是个问题。
    以上只简单的谈一些情况和提一些问题，应该如何认识，如何解决，尚需在工作中认真研究。
