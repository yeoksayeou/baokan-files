　　Typhus and Lice
　　Wen Zhong
　　Typhus is an acute infectious disease: the whole body breaks out in rashes, there is a high fever, mental confusion, even madness. The contagiousness of this disease is particularly strong. Living with a patient, it is easy to be infected with the slightest carelessness. The pathogen: generally considered to be a small body with the scientific name "Rickettsia prowazekii." The transmission is entirely due to the lice on the patient. When the lice bite the patient and suck the patient's blood into their stomach, they also suck the pathogen into their stomach at the same time. If this louse runs to someone else and bites them, injecting the pathogen into their body, that person will also get sick. In this way, due to lice spreading from one to another, it spreads more and more, causing a large epidemic.
　　After being bitten by lice, the pathogen begins to multiply in the blood. In the beginning, for about ten days, people feel slightly heavy all over, have a headache, and do not want to eat; the joints ache. After these ten days, the original disease form appears. It can be roughly divided into three stages:
　　The first stage is called the onset stage. A sudden fever, chills, and within one or two days, the fever rises to 39 or 40 degrees Celsius, and the pulse is also fast, beating about 100 times per minute. The face is flushed, somewhat swollen, the eyeballs are red, there is a headache, body aches, mental confusion, and often insomnia. The urine is also less and becomes dark red, and some have a slight cough. At this time, the patient's liver and spleen are enlarged and somewhat painful.
　　The second stage is called the rash stage. Rashes appear four to six days after the onset of the disease. The rashes are light red and the size of peas, slightly raised from the skin surface, becoming indistinctly edged spots, with a slight seepage of blood in the middle. The chest and limbs are the most affected, and the palms and soles also have them. This is a characteristic of the disease, which is different from typhoid fever. During this period, the fever is erratic, between 39 and 40 degrees Celsius. The tongue coating is thick and dry, the patient talks nonsense, curses, and sometimes acts wildly and hits people.
　　The third stage is called the recovery stage. Fifteen to sixteen days after the onset of the disease, the fever drops little by little, or the fever breaks with profuse sweating, the color of the rashes darkens and gradually fades, the skin surface flakes off like chaff sugar, the pulse returns to normal, beating about 70 times per minute, and the mind becomes clear. The patient wants to eat and can sleep. After another ten days of recuperation, the patient is completely healed.
　　The most important thing for the patient is care. During the rash period, never leave the patient alone. Give the patient easily digestible foods such as thin porridge, rice soup, egg yolks, or milk. If thirsty, give them ice chips or drink cold boiled water. When they have a fever and headache, apply an ice pack or cool towel to the head. If the heart is weak, give a cardiotonic injection early. Injecting large amounts of physiological saline or Ringer's solution is also a good method.
　　In addition, there are several special medicines: such as Salvarsan, Toluylene Blue, 606, Vitamin C, etc., which can sometimes have unexpected effects when used in early treatment.
　　How can you avoid getting the disease? The problem is simple: first, eliminate lice. This disease is entirely transmitted by lice. Without lice, the bacteria will not enter our bodies. The basic way to eliminate lice is to pay attention to cleanliness. In collective living places such as factories, armies, and schools, more attention should be paid. The room should be cleaned regularly, and the body should be bathed frequently, or use one ounce of *Stemona japonica*, soaked in about one catty of alcohol (strong white spirit), and simmer over a gentle fire. After boiling, filter the water and use this water to dip cotton and wipe the whole body. Wiping for about ten days can guarantee that lice will not grow for three months.
　　Clothes, bedding, etc., should be washed and changed frequently. It is best to boil them in a pot when washing, or steam them in a steamer. Using two mace of *Xuehua* herb added to two catties of water, boil it, and use this water to wash clothes and bedding, which will also prevent lice from growing. Putting it in the sun for five or six hours will also kill the lice. If you soak it in 5% carbolic acid solution for four or five minutes, lice will not grow, and even the bacteria will die. In addition, there are two money-saving and labor-saving methods that can be introduced: one is to iron the lice to death with an iron. If you can't finish it once, you will definitely finish it twice, whether it is a single cotton garment or quilt. When ironing, pay attention to the seams of the clothes, collar, armpits, waistband of trousers, and other places. The second is to heat the *kang* (a heated brick bed) and put the clothes and bedding on the *kang* to bake the lice to death.
　　If a patient is found, they must be isolated, and the patient's clothing and bedding should be used to eliminate lice using the above methods. Not isolating patients is the most dangerous.
　　There is a way to avoid getting sick: injecting a preventative vaccine. The preventative injection is given in three doses: the first dose is half a watt, the second dose is one watt, and the last dose is one watt, with an interval of seven to ten days between each dose. There are no side effects, only a slight fever and headache, which will be fine in half a day. Getting a preventative injection can increase the body's resistance and reduce the chance of getting sick or not getting sick.

　　斑疹伤寒与虱子
    闻仲
    斑疹伤寒是一个急性传染病：全身出疹子，发高烧，精神错乱，甚至于发疯发狂。这个病的传染力特别强，和病人住在一起，稍微不加小心，就容易传染上，病原体：一般认为是一种学名叫做“里克甲，普罗瓦这基”的小体。传染完全是由于病人身上的虱子，当虱子咬了病人，把病人的血吸到胃里时，同时就把病原也吸到胃里去，这个虱子再跑到别人身上一咬别人，把那病原刺进身体里，那个人也就得病了。这样，就由于虱子一个传一个，越传越多，造成大的流行。
    叫虱子咬了后，病原体在血里开始繁殖，起初的十来天工夫，人稍微觉得全身发沉，头痛，不想饭吃；骨头节痛，过了这十来天，就现本来的病形了。大致可分三期：
    第一期叫做发病期。突然发热，打冷战，在一、两天间发烧到三十九度或四十度，脉也快，一分钟跳一百下左右。脸发潮红，有些浮肿，眼珠发红，头痛，全身痛，精神模糊，常常睡不着觉。尿也撒的少，变成暗红色，有的稍微有点咳嗽。这时病人的肝脏、脾脏都肿大，有些疼痛。
    第二期叫做发疹期。在发病后四天到六天就出现疹子，疹子是淡红色有豌豆大，自皮面稍稍隆起，成为故缘不明的斑状，中间象有点渗血似的。胸部及四肢最多，手心，脚心也有。这是本病的特点，和伤寒病不同。这个时期发热不定，在三十九度到四十度之间·舌苔厚并且干燥，说胡话，骂人，有时乱闹，打人。
    第三期叫恢复期。发病到第十五天，十六天头，热一点一点下降，或是出大汗退热，疹子色发暗，渐渐消褪，皮肤面象秕糖样掉渣，脉永恢复正常，一分钟跳七十下左右，精神也明白过来。想吃饭，也能睡着觉了。再养十来天就全好了。
    对于病人最主要的是看护。在发疹期千万不要离人，吃的给他稀粥、米汤或是鸡蛋黄、牛奶等容易消化的东西。口渴给吃点冰块或喝凉白开水。发烧头痛时，头部贴冰囊或凉手巾。心脏衰弱时，早期打强心药针。注射大量的生理盐水或林盖尔氏液也是很好的办法。
    另外还有几种特别药：比如象洒利汞、脱吕波夫拉文、六○六、维他命丙等等，在早期治疗的时候，有时可收到意外的效果。
    怎样能不得病？问题很简单，第一是扑灭虱子。这个病完全由虱子传染，没有虱子，病菌不会钻进我们人身体里，扑灭虱子的基本办法就是要注意清洁。在工厂、军队、学校等集体生活的地方，更应当注意。居室要经常打扫干净，身体要常洗澡，或用百部草一两，泡在一斤左右的酒精（老白干）里，用文火煮，煮过后过滤，用这水蘸棉花擦全身，擦十来天，可保证三个月不长虱子。
    衣服、被褥等应常洗常换。洗的时候最好是用锅煮一下，或是用笼屉蒸蒸。用二钱蓄花草加二斤来水，煮后用这水洗衣服、被褥，也不长虱子。放在曝日下晒五六小时，虱子也会死。如果用百分之五的石炭酸水泡四、五分钟，不长虱子，连病菌也死了。另外有两个既省钱又不费事的办法可以介绍：一是用熨斗（烙铁）熨死虱子。一次弄不完，二次定完，不论单棉衣被都可以。熨时要注意衣缝、领子、腋窝、裤腰等地方。二是烧热炕头，将衣被放在炕上烙死虱子。
    如果发现病人，必须隔离，将病人衣被用以上方法扑灭虱子。病人不隔离是最危险的。
    这有一个不得病的方法是注射预防药针。预防针分三次打，第一次打半瓦，第二次打一瓦，最后打一瓦，每次间隔七天到十天。没有什么副作用，只稍觉发烧、头痛，一半天就好。打预防针可以增加人体的抵抗力，减少得病或不得病。
