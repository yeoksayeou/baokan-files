　　Jinan First Prefectural Committee of Jilu Henan Province recently conducted a relatively systematic review and analysis of Linqing City's industrial and commercial work over the past year, pointing out achievements and proposing suggestions for the future.

　　In the past year, Linqing achieved considerable success in developing industry and commerce. The main manifestations are: basically implementing the policy of "developing production, promoting economic prosperity, benefiting both labor and capital, and taking into account both public and private interests." The number of industrial and commercial households in the city increased from 5,051 to 5,610 (an increase of 559 households), and the number of workers also increased accordingly. Some understanding has been gained on how to lead urban work. By correcting policies, efforts began to strengthen factory management and employee work. Lessons were learned in practical work, recognizing the importance of controlling market prices, and starting to learn how to control prices, manage trade, and fight against unscrupulous merchants. Therefore, in the work of the past year, the errors of the past practice of simply transplanting rural work methods have been corrected.

　　From the process of Linqing's industrial and commercial development, it can be seen that correcting policies is a key factor. In the past, during the crackdown on traitors and liquidation, it was not clear what constituted traitor property or enemy and puppet materials. When confiscating feudal property, it was not clear what constituted feudal property, thus mistakenly harming individual industrial and commercial households. The Municipal Party Committee's approach of carefully studying each case and resolving them separately was correct. However, due to the lack of clarity on some fundamental issues in guiding ideology, the following deviations and shortcomings were exposed in the work.

　　Regarding the leadership and development of industry and commerce, the Linqing City leadership had two confused ideas: First, they vaguely and unilaterally viewed "developing production, promoting economic prosperity, taking into account both public and private interests, and benefiting both labor and capital" as simply providing convenience for the development of private industry and commerce. Second, they mistakenly believed that the rectification campaign of the spring of the previous year was to remove obstacles to the development of industry and commerce. At the same time, the state-owned economy abandoned its leading position in industry and commerce, allowing private industry and commerce to develop freely. Therefore, the specific work manifested as: ① regarding simply making money as prosperity, without considering the overall future development of the new democratic economy; ② neglecting the management of private commerce and the struggle against unscrupulous merchants, even turning a blind eye to the speculative fraud of unscrupulous merchants in the cotton incident; ③ neglecting the development and support of the cooperative economy, failing to allow the state-owned and public economies to play their due leading role. This was a significant loss in the past year.

　　Regarding the need to rely on the working class to unite all working people, due to a one-sided understanding of the policy of developing industry and commerce, when correcting the "leftist" deviations in the workers' movement, only the interests of the capitalists, such as suppressing excessively high wages and opposing non-compliance with labor discipline, were emphasized, while neglecting how to protect the interests of workers and shop assistants, such as workers' political life, learning life, and necessary sanitary conditions. Due to an unclear stance and insufficient understanding of the Party's line, insufficient attention was paid to workers' work. Among the more than nine hundred workers in Linqing City, there were very few Party members, trade union organizations were not widespread, and workers' education was not carried out in a planned manner. Due to these reasons, it was not possible to fully mobilize the high degree of enthusiasm and creativity of workers in production.

　　Regarding how to overcome the above deviations and shortcomings and improve the future leadership and development of industrial and commercial work, efforts should be made in the following aspects.

　　First, strengthen the leadership and management of public enterprises and deeply develop the workers' movement.

　　In strengthening the leadership and management of public enterprises, the Municipal Party Committee needs to ensure the implementation of policies and the completion of plans prescribed by higher authorities by regularly helping, supervising, and inspecting the work of cadres in public enterprises and solving their problems. First, democratic management must be implemented in factories, a strong factory management committee must be established, plans must be formulated, and all employees must discuss and study them, consciously striving to complete these plans. Second, precise cost accounting, product inspection, and accounting leadership systems must be established to achieve the goal of increasing quantity and quality and reducing costs.

　　The workers' movement must be strengthened, trade union organizations must be established and improved, workers' awareness must be raised; under the principle of taking into account both public and private interests, the workers' own problems must be solved; workers' education must be deepened, production competitions must be launched to guarantee and promote the progress of production work.

　　In private factories and enterprises, workers' education and ideological mobilization should be strengthened, trade unions should be established, so that workers can participate in and organize themselves into their own trade unions, raise their ideological awareness, and concretely implement various policies such as benefiting both labor and capital, so that workers recognize their responsibility to complete the reasonable production plans of the capitalists. At the same time, they should assist and supervise the capitalists in implementing industrial and commercial policies, labor policies, and enforcing government decrees.

　　The organizational leadership of trade unions, such as collective workers in factories, or skilled workers and coolies who are easier to concentrate, can form trade unions by industry; scattered workers who are not easy to concentrate can organize street trade unions by street, and then divide them into groups by industry to facilitate leadership. The Municipal Federation of Trade Unions shall be produced by the congress of representatives elected by the street trade unions and industry trade unions, becoming a truly democratic centralist organization.

　　Second, strengthen industrial and commercial management and earnestly study and grasp prices. Past practical work has given us many lessons. Now we must (1) establish an Economic Committee, and the state-owned economic departments must strictly organize discipline. (2) Study market laws, grasp the surrounding situation, set up special personnel to investigate, regularly report the situation, and be able to actively prepare solutions whenever a change occurs. Resolutely crack down on the speculative activities of unscrupulous merchants, launch denunciations, or conduct inspections with a focus. (3) Take workers, independent laborers, workers' families, and poor urban residents as targets, vigorously organize supply and marketing, consumer cooperatives, and organize mass production.

　　Third, regarding Party building. First, take root among the workers and establish Party organizations. Linqing's past neglect of this work was wrong. In the future, Party education should be conducted openly among workers to raise workers' awareness, and in production and other movements, discover and cultivate objects for Party development, and cautiously absorb workers and young enlightened elements who have been working for many years and have pure thoughts to join the Party, and regard this work as the center of current Party building.

　　Fourth, regarding the combination of urban and rural areas: (1) expand and transform department stores, add markets for agricultural products and rural sideline products, and attach farmers' buying and selling information offices. (2) The city's production promotion society should establish warehouses for cotton, grain, oil, groceries, etc., to assist and replace farmers or rural cooperatives in promoting various products. (3) In conjunction with this year's large-scale production campaign, systematically help existing iron furnaces, bamboo ware industries, and wood factories to manufacture agricultural tools and some handicraft production tools. Regarding the required number of agricultural tools, production plans can be formulated based on surveys.

### 临清市一年工作检讨与今后意见

　　临清市一年工作检讨与今后意见
    冀南一地委近对临清市去年一年工商业工作，作了较系统的检查与分析，指出了成绩，并提出今后意见。
    去年一年中，临清在发展工商业方面，获得相当成绩。主要表现在：基本上贯彻了“发展生产，繁荣经济，劳资两利，公私兼顾”的方针。使该市工商业由五千零五十一户增加到五千六百一十户（新增五百五十九户），工人也随之增多。在如何领导城市工作的问题上，摸到一些门路，经过端正政策，开始加强工厂管理和职工工作。并在实际工作中接受了教训，认识到掌握市场物价的重要，并开始学习到如何掌握物价，管理贸易及与奸商作斗争。因此在一年来的工作中，对于过去搬运农村工作的一套做法的错误，也得到了纠正。
    从临清工商业发展的过程中，可以看出端正政策是一个重要关键。过去在反奸清算时，没有弄清那些算是汉奸财产或敌伪物资：在查封建时，没有弄清什么算是封建财产，因而误伤了个别的工商户。市委在处理这个问题时，采取慎重的逐户研究、分别解决的办法，是正确的。但是由于有些原则问题，指导思想上尚欠明确，故在工作中暴露出以下的偏向和缺点。
    在领导与发展工商业问题上，临清市的领导思想有两种糊涂观念：第一，把“发展生产，繁荣经济，公私兼顾，劳资两利”，笼统地片面地看成为单纯给私人工商业的发展以方便。第二，把前年春天的整党错误地认为是扫除发展工商业的障碍。同时，国营经济放弃了在工商业中的领导地位，放任私人工商业自流地发展，因而在具体工作中表现了：①以单纯的赚钱为繁荣，不从整个新民主主义经济的发展前途着眼；②忽视对私营商业的管理和对奸商的斗争，乃至对棉花事件中奸商的投机欺诈，熟视无睹；③忽视发展与扶助合作经济，未能使国营公营经济发挥其应有的领导作用。这是过去一年中一个很大的损失。
    在必须依靠工人团结一切劳动人民的问题上，由于对发展工商业的方针的片面了解，因此在纠正职工运动中左的偏向时，只强调了压低过高工资，反对不遵守劳动纪律等资本家利益的一方面，而忽视了应如何保护工人店员的利益，如工人的政治生活、学习生活、必要的卫生条件等等。由于立场不明确，以及对党的路线认识不足，因此对工人工作非常不够重视。临清市九百多工人中，党员很少很少，工会组织也不普遍，工人教育也没有有计划地进行。由于这种种原因，便没有能够充分地发动起工人在生产中高度的积极性创造性。
    关于如何克服上述偏向和缺点及改进今后领导与发展工商业的工作，应从下面几个方面，加以努力。
    首先应加强公营企业的领导与管理及深入开展职工运动。
    在加强公营企业的领导与管理上，市委需要从经常帮助督促和检查公营企业干部的工作及解决其问题中，保证执行政策和完成上级规定的计划。首先要在工厂中实现民主管理，建立强有力的工厂管理委员会，制定计划，并由全体员工讨论研究，自觉地为完成这一计划而奋斗。其次要建立精确的成本核算、成品检查以及会计领导等制度，达到提高数量、质量与减低成本的目的。
    职工运动必须加强，建立和健全工会组织，提高工人的觉悟；在公私兼顾的原则下，解决工人切身的问题；深入工人教育，发动生产竞赛，保证和推动生产工作的进展。
    在私营工厂企业中，则应加强工人的教育与思想发动，建立工会，使工人参加和组织到自己的工会里去，提高其思想觉悟，并具体实施劳资两利等各项政策，使工人认识有责任完成资方合理的生产计划，同时应协助和监督资方实现工商政策、劳动政策，执行政府法令。
    工会的组织领导，如工厂中的集体工人，或较易集中的手艺工人苦力工人，可以以行业为单位成立工会；不易集中的分散的工人，可以按街道组织街工会，再按行业分为小组，以便于领导。市职工会则由各街工会、行业工会选出代表组成的代表大会产生之，成为真正的民主集中制的组织。
    第二、加强工商管理，切实研究掌握物价。过去实际工作曾经给我们不少教训，现在必须（一）成立经委会，国营经济部门严格组织性纪律性。（二）研究市场规律，掌握周围情况，设专人调查，定期汇报情况，每遇一变化，即能主动准备处理办法。对于奸商投机活动，坚决予以打击，发动检举或有重点地进行检查。（三）以工人、独立劳动者、工人家属及贫苦市民为对象，大力组织供销、消费合作社与组织群众生产。
    第三、关于建党问题。首先在工人中扎下根子，建立党的组织。临清过去对这一工作的忽视是错误的。今后应在工人中公开进行党的教育，提高工人觉悟，并在生产等各种运动中，发现与培养发展党的对象，慎重地吸收长年劳动、思想纯洁的工人与青年觉悟分子参加党，并把这一工作当作目前建党的中心。
    第四、关于城市与农村结合的问题：（一）扩大与改造百货商场，增设农产品及农村副业生产品的市场，并附设农民买卖问事处。（二）市生产推进社应创办棉、粮、油类、杂货等货栈，协助和代替农民或农村合作社推销各种生产品。（三）结合今年的大生产运动，有计划地帮助现有的铁炉、竹货业、木厂，制造农具和某些手工业生产工具。关于农具的需用数量，可以根据调查，订出生产计划。
