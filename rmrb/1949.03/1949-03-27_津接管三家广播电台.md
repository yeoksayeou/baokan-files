　　Tianjin Takes Over Three Radio Stations
　　[Tianjin Electric] The former Kuomintang Tianjin Municipal Government Cultural Broadcasting Station, the Youth League Broadcasting Station, and the Tianjin Huasheng Broadcasting Station have been formally taken over by order of the Tianjin Military Control Commission after careful review. The Cultural Broadcasting Station was run by the Kuomintang Central Bureau of Investigation and Statistics and consistently engaged in anti-people espionage activities. The Youth League Broadcasting Station was funded by the Tianjin Secret Service Group of the Kuomintang Military Investigation and Statistics Bureau. Although it has been off the air for two years, it is still a secret service organization of the Bureau. The Huasheng Broadcasting Station was run by personnel from the Military Intelligence Bureau. In addition to conducting anti-people propaganda, it also assisted the Political Work Department of the pseudo-Tianjin Garrison Command in reconnaissance work and carried out anti-people activities for the "Loyalty and Relief Society," an external reactionary organization of the Military Intelligence Bureau. The Military Control Commission, considering that these stations had concrete evidence of reactionary activities, took them over. However, private shares in the Cultural and Huasheng Broadcasting Stations were returned to private individuals.

　　津接管三家广播电台
    【天津电】前国民党天津市政府文化广播电台、青联广播电台、天津华声广播电台，经天津市军管会周密审查后，已于日前正式下令接管。查文化广播电台系国民党中央调查统计局所经营，一贯作反人民的特务活动。青联广播电台系国民党军事调查统计局所属天津区保密组出资经营，虽已停播两年，但仍为该局特务活动机关。华声广播电台系军统局人员经营。除作反人民宣传外，尚协助伪天津警备司令部政工处作侦察工作，并为军统局外围反动团体“忠义普济社”进行反人民活动。军管会因该台等反动有据，当予接管，但文化、华声两广播电台中普遍私人股份，仍发还私人。
