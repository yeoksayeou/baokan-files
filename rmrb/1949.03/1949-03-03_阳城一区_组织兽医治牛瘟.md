【Taiyue Electric】Due to the recent severe outbreak of rinderpest, Yangcheng First District held a district-wide veterinary meeting on the 17th of last month, inviting everyone to study the current condition of the livestock and how to treat them. Eleven veterinarians attended, introducing the current condition of livestock, which included diarrhea, measles, and jaundice. They also researched prescriptions for treating various diseases, as well as seasonal medications for disease prevention. In addition, everyone proposed organizing doctors to go to the countryside for a major inspection, to treat the sick and prevent illness in those who are not sick. It was immediately decided to divide into four groups and immediately go to the countryside for inspection, reporting to the district office on the 1st and 15th of each month to exchange experiences. On the 18th, everyone collectively conducted an inspection in Pingtou. After this news spread, the masses brought their livestock for inspection. For a time, cattle and donkeys gathered in groups, and the eleven veterinarians checked them one by one. They found 29 large cattle and 4 small cattle that needed to take Qingfei San; 1 donkey and 1 horse that needed to take Yingchen San; 1 head of cattle with lung disease; and more than 40 healthy cattle.
