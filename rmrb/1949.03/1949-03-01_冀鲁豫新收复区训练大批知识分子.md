[Hebei-Shandong-Henan Telegram] In the vast newly liberated areas of Pei County and Dangshan County in the Third Sub-district, intellectuals are actively participating in work or study, and education in schools at all levels is rapidly recovering. At the initial stage of liberation in this area, most intellectuals showed signs of retreat and observation due to unclear understanding of our policies. After the democratic government explained the victorious situation of the national revolution and various policies, they actively requested to participate in work or study in the liberated areas. For example, after the symposium for intellectuals in Pei County, teachers from Pei County Middle School took the initiative to connect with other teachers to enroll students and resume classes. Eight hundred and fourteen students registered to take the entrance exam for Pei County Middle School. At the same time, higher and primary schools in various places have generally resumed. Up to the end of the twelfth lunar month of last year, Pei County had restored 204 schools (including one middle school and 36 higher primary schools); Feng County had 36 schools (including 12 higher primary schools); Huashan County had 32 primary schools and 4 higher primary schools; Yutai County had 5 primary schools and 2 higher primary schools; and Pei-Tong Middle School is also preparing to resume classes. Many people requested to study at the intellectual training class run by the Third Special Commissioner's Office. There are currently 184 students in the class. After a period of study, they have initially established the concept of serving the people and are in high spirits. In order to meet the needs of intellectuals in rural areas, the office has decided to continue to run training classes.
　　
[Another Telegram] The Changyuan County Government in the Fourth Sub-district has successively run three intellectual training classes, with a total of 324 students. The first class had only 39 students, the second class had 85 students, and the third class reached 200 students. 120 people have already participated in work.

　　冀鲁豫新收复区训练大批知识分子
    【冀鲁豫电】三分区沛县、砀山等县广大新解放区的知识分子，纷纷参加工作或学习，各级学校教育迅速恢复。该区初解放时，一般知识分子由于对我们政策认识不清，表现退缩和观望。经过民主政府讲解全国革命胜利形势与各种政策后，即纷纷要求参加解放区工作或学习。如沛县知识分子座谈会之后，沛县中学教员即主动串联教员招生复学，报名考沛中的学生即有八百十四人。同时各地高、初小学校亦普遍恢复，迄去年阴历十二月底止，沛县已恢复学校二百零四处（内中学一处、高小三十六处）；丰县三十六处（内高小十二处）；华山县初小三十二处、高小四处；鱼台县初小五处、高小二处；沛铜中学也正在准备复课。三专署办的知识分子训练班，很多人要求去学习，现在该班有学员一百八十四名，经过了一段学习，初步树立了为人民服务的观念，情绪极为高涨。该署为满足在乡知识分子的要求，决定继续开办训练班。
    【又电】四分区长垣县府曾连续开办知识分子训练班三期，学员总数三百二十四人。第一期学员仅三十九人，第二期学员即有八十五人，第三期则达二百名。现已有一百二十人参加工作。
