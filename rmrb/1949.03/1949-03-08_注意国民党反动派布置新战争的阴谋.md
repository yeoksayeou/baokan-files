　　Beware of the Kuomintang Reactionaries' Plot to Arrange a New War
　　The Kuomintang reactionaries are fanatically preparing for war. The Kuomintang "government" has already formulated a plan to recruit 2.5 million new soldiers, preparing to restore the Kuomintang army, especially Chiang Kai-shek's direct line troops, which have been annihilated by the People's Liberation Army. Most of the army and division commanders of these troops have already been appointed. The puppet Ministry of National Defense has also been ordered to establish twelve training headquarters, and some troops are undergoing retraining. American imperialist munitions and weapons continue to be shipped to the Kuomintang government, including a batch of rifles, bullets, and tanks recently sold cheaply by the U.S. Army Department. The Kuomintang is using these weapons to equip newly established troops. Bandit chieftain Chiang Kai-shek is issuing orders every day, busily directing the Kuomintang bandit gang to carry out combat deployments. The leaders of the Kuomintang die-hards are flying in and out of Xikou, asking Chiang Kai-shek for instructions on action plans. The Kuomintang is also conducting open war mobilization within its ranks under the slogan of "preparing for war to seek peace."

　　All of this indicates that what the Kuomintang reactionaries are currently implementing is not a "peace" policy of "shortening the war time," "reducing the people's suffering," and "taking saving the people as a prerequisite," as they have promoted, but is indeed a war policy of prolonging the war time, increasing the people's suffering, and taking saving the Kuomintang's counter-revolutionary rule as a prerequisite.

　　The "peace offensive" carried out by the Kuomintang reactionaries under the instigation of American imperialism serves this war policy. The reactionaries believe that all the elite divisions and main forces of their reactionary army have been annihilated by the People's Liberation Army, so it is necessary to obtain a period of respite in order to rebuild their counter-revolutionary military strength and continue the war. Bandit chieftain Chiang Kai-shek has indicated that he intends to use Li Zongren's peace talks to win three to six months to realize the arrogant plan of organizing 400 divisions with 2 million people. This plan of the Kuomintang die-hards is already an open secret.

　　The people of the whole country now clearly see that the Kuomintang reactionaries, who insist on carrying out the counter-revolution to the end, cannot coexist with true democratic peace. In order to realize true democratic peace, it is necessary to thoroughly eliminate the Kuomintang die-hards who insist on the counter-revolutionary war policy, arrest and severely punish the war criminals who resolutely carry out the counter-revolution to the end, and thoroughly reorganize all the remaining troops of the Kuomintang reactionaries in accordance with democratic principles. If this is not done, it will be impossible to achieve true democratic peace.

### 注意国民党反动派布置新战争的阴谋

　　注意国民党反动派布置新战争的阴谋
    国民党反动派正在狂热地准备战争。国民党“政府”已经制定了一个征募新兵二百五十万的计划，准备把已经被人民解放军歼灭的国民党军队特别是蒋介石的嫡系部队重新恢复起来，这些部队的军长师长大部分都已派定。伪国防部并已奉令成立了十二个编练司令部，一部分部队正在补训中。美国帝国主义的军火武器继续输送给国民党政府，其中包括最近美国陆军部廉价出售的一批步枪子弹及坦克等物，国民党正利用这些武器装备新建立的部队。匪首蒋介石每天都在发号施令，忙碌地指挥着国民党匪帮进行作战部署。国民党死硬派的首领们在溪口飞进飞出，向蒋介石请示行动计划。国民党并在所谓“备战以谋和”的口号下，对其内部进行公开的战争动员。
    这一切都指明，国民党反动派现在所实行的，不是什么象他们所宣传的那样“缩短战争时间”、“减轻人民痛苦”、“以拯救人民为前提”的和平方针，而确确实实地是延长战争时间、加重人民痛苦和以拯救国民党反革命统治为前提的战争方针。
    国民党反动派在美国帝国主义指使下所进行的“和平攻势”是为这个战争方针服务的。反动派以为他们的反动军队的所有精锐师团和主力，都已为人民解放军所歼灭，因此必需取得一段喘息的时间，才能重建其反革命的军事力量继续战争。匪首蒋介石已表示拟借李宗仁谈和，争取三个月到六个月的时间，以实现编组四百个师二百万人的狂妄计划。国民党死硬派的这个计划，已经是公开的秘密。
    全国人民现在已经清楚地看到：坚持反革命到底的国民党反动派，与真正的民主的和平是不能共存的。为了实现真正民主的和平，就必须彻底扫除坚持反革命战争方针的国民党死硬派，将坚决反革命到底的战争罪犯捉拿归案，加以严厉惩办，并根据民主原则彻底改编国民党反动派的一切残余军队。如果不这样做，那就不可能实现真正的民主的和平。
