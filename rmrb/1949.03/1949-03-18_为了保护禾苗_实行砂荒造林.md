　　To Protect Seedlings
　　Implement Afforestation in Sandy Wastelands
　　[Special Dispatch from this Newspaper] The North China Government's Ministry of Agriculture convened the Jixi Sandy Wasteland Afforestation Conference on the 15th of last month, determining a three-season afforestation plan. The large areas of sandy wasteland along the Pinghan Railway in Jixi, such as Lao Ci River and Shendao Beach (including Zhengding, Xingtang, Quyang, Xinle, Wuji, Gaocheng, and other six counties), cover an area of approximately 510,000 mu. The spring windblown sand is the most damaging, harming field seedlings, filling in good farmland, and destroying water wells. In Huangjiazhuang Village, Xinle County alone, 27 water wells have been filled in by sand in recent years, and nearly 1,000 mu of good land has been damaged. Therefore, afforestation in sandy wastelands has become an extremely important issue at present. Based on specific conditions, the counties of Jixi have formulated specific plans for afforestation in three seasons throughout the year. A total of 1,190,000 trees will be planted in 253 key villages in 26 districts of the six counties for sandy wasteland afforestation during the three seasons, including small protective forest belts and riverside forests, mainly consisting of poplar, willow, pear, and apricot trees. 620,000 trees will be planted in the spring, 350,000 in the summer, and 220,000 in the autumn. Including other afforestation efforts, the six counties will plant a total of 2,000,000 trees throughout the year. Regarding the organizational leadership for afforestation and forest protection at all levels, it was decided that before the official establishment of the Jixi Sandy Wasteland Afforestation Bureau, the Ministry of Agriculture and relevant local governments will jointly organize the Jixi Sandy Wasteland Afforestation Implementation Committee to provide unified leadership. At the county level, the original production committees will promote afforestation work in their respective counties; in each district, afforestation committees will be organized during the afforestation season, with the participation of district chiefs, industrial cadres, and local experienced farmers who are enthusiastic about afforestation. Each key village will organize afforestation and forest protection committees to provide year-round leadership for this work. Starting from the development of sandy wasteland afforestation this spring, efforts will be made to complete the inspection and summary work in the six counties before the end of March. At that time, democratic assessments will also be conducted, and counties, districts, and staff members with excellent performance will be rewarded by the respective counties and the Jixi Sandy Wasteland Afforestation Committee.

　　为了保护禾苗
  　实行砂荒造林
    【本报特讯】华北政府农业部上月十五日召开之冀西砂荒造林会议，确定一年三季造林计划。冀西的平汉沿线老磁河、神道滩等大块砂荒（包括正定、行唐、曲阳、新乐、无极、藁城等六县），面积约五十一万余亩。砂荒以春风砂为害最烈，损坏田苗填毁良田与水井，仅新乐黄家庄一村近年来即有水井二十七眼被砂子填毁，近千亩的好地被压坏。因之，砂荒造林成为当前极重要的问题。冀西各县根据具体情况，做出全年三季造林的具体计划。总计六县二十六个区二百五十三个砂荒造林的重点村，全年三季造林一百一十九万株，包括小型的防护林带与沿河的树林，以杨柳、杜梨、杏林为主，春季完成六十二万株，夏季完成三十五万株，秋后二十二万株。连其他造林，六县全年共造林二百万株。关于各级造林护林之组织领导问题，决定在冀西砂荒造林局未正式成立前，由农业部及有关地方政府共同组织冀西砂荒造林实施委员会统一领导，县级由原有生产委员会推动本县造林工作；各区在造林季节，组织造林委员会，由区长、实业干部与当地热心造林的老农参加，各重点村则组织造林保林委员会，常年领导该项工作。由今春开展砂荒造林，争取在三月底以前完成六县的检查与总结工作，届时并进行民主评定，对于成绩优良的县区与工作人员，由各县与冀西砂荒造林委员会予以奖励。
