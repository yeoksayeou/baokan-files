Criticism and Suggestions

    Oppose Illegal Acts of Hitting People! To the Editor:
    At 5:00 PM on February 11th, a train inspector hit someone at the Xing'an Station on the Shide Railway. The story is as follows: When the train approached, children were watching haphazardly. One of them, a thirteen-year-old, did not move away from the railway tracks, which was very dangerous. Fortunately, the train stopped. The responsible spirit of the worker comrades is commendable and should be praised. Logically, the inspector should have gotten off the train, criticized and educated the child, and told him to be careful in the future. However, the inspector beat the child severely. When the child's mother embraced her son, the inspector even asked, "What are you doing?" and tried to pull the child onto the train.
    Hitting people is an illegal act in the liberated areas and should be severely criticized.

　　Hoping to Take Care of Revolutionary Soldiers Mailing Letters To the Editor:
    Since the postal rates increased and free military postage was discontinued, it costs six RMB to send a letter. A soldier's monthly allowance is six jin of millet. After buying some tobacco and toothpaste, there is little left. However, when letters arrive from home or from comrades, one cannot avoid replying. It is common to see comrades worrying about postage, and some comrades write letters but have to put them away because the postage is too expensive. This makes everyone very critical of the military's postal situation. It is hoped that the responsible comrades of our North China People's Government and the post office will consider the above opinions and provide appropriate care and solutions.

　　Militia Should Not Search Prisoners' Pockets To the Editor:
    After our platoon completed its mission in Handan and returned to Shijiazhuang, at 2:00 PM on the 15th of this month, we encountered two captured soldiers on the road west of Shizhuang Village in the fourth district of Yuanshi County. They were wearing tattered civilian clothes and had tears in their eyes. They told us, "The militiamen on duty exchanged my overcoat." When we looked ahead, we saw three militiamen holding two rifles. They were all wearing leather hats, military overcoats, and hiding leather shoes in their waists. They were militiamen from Shizhuang Village in the fourth district of Yuanshi County, named Yin Sanyuan, Ren Shulin, and Gu Jiyin. They used the excuse of guarding the post to search the prisoners' pockets. I think this kind of action that violates revolutionary discipline should not exist. It is hoped that the Yuanshi County Armed Forces Department will strengthen the education of these villagers' militia and quickly and strictly stop this behavior.

专栏：批评与建议

    批评与建议
　　反对打人的非法行动！编辑同志：
    二月十一日下午五时在石德路兴安站西边，火车的检查员打了人。事情是这样：当火车过来时，小孩们乱看，其中有一个十三岁的小孩，在铁路上未曾躲开，很危险，幸而火车停住了。工人同志这种负责精神是很好的，应当表扬，按理：检查员下车给予批评教育让他以后注意就对了。但是检查员却将小孩痛打一顿。小孩的母亲将她的儿子抱住，检查员还问：“你是干什么的？”还要拉小孩上火车。
    在解放区里打人是非法行动，应给予严厉批评。

　　希望照顾革命军人寄信编辑同志：
    自从邮价增资以来，同时军邮免费也停止。寄一封信即要人民币六元，每个战士一个月的津贴是六斤小米，除了买点旱烟、买袋牙粉已所余无几。但是家里来了信，同志们来了信，又不能不回信，常见有的同志为寄信发愁，也见有的同志把信写好啦，因邮费贵只好又装起来。这样使得大家对军人邮寄上非常有意见，希望我华北人民政府和邮局负责同志根据以上意见，给以适当的照顾和解决才好。

　　民兵不应搜俘虏腰包编辑同志：
    我们排到邯郸执行任务完毕，返回石家庄时，于本月十五日下午两点，途经元氏县四区市庄村西，在汽车路上遇见了两个俘虏兵，身穿破便衣，眼里不住的流着泪，对我们说：“那站岗的民兵把我大衣给换了。”我们向前一看果然有三个民兵拿着两枝步枪，他们都是戴着皮帽子，穿着军大衣，腰中藏着一双皮鞋。他们是元氏县四区市庄村的民兵，名叫殷三元、仁树林、谷吉印。他们借口站岗盘查搜俘虏的腰包。我想这种违反革命纪律的行动是极不应当有的。希望元氏县武装部对该村民兵加强教育，迅速地严格制止。
