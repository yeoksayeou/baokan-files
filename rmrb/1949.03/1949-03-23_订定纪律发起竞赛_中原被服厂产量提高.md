Xinhua News Agency, Central Plains, 20th. After inspiring revolutionary consciousness and promoting democracy, the Second Sewing Factory of the Central Plains Uniform Factory organized and mobilized new workers who had just joined the factory, launching a campaign to perform meritorious service. The factory was established less than two months ago, with most of the workers coming from the cities of Zhengzhou, Luoyang, and Kaifeng. They originally operated independently and were not accustomed to collective life. In addition, the factory's various systems were not yet sound, so work was lax and scattered at the beginning. Although the working hours were stipulated as 7:30 AM, sometimes workers were not all present until 9:00 AM. The factory had fifty machines, and the normal output should be around 1,000 shirts per day, but they were only producing 750 to 800 shirts. To correct this phenomenon, the factory put forward the slogan of supporting the front line, encouraging workers to discuss it extensively to make them aware of the importance of active production. After the discussion, the workers established production teams and formulated production plans. The factory then proposed the establishment of a factory management committee, composed of three active workers elected by the workers, as well as the manager and a production inspector. The committee then determined working hours, established labor discipline, established a food management committee, and launched a campaign to perform meritorious service. After the education and rectification listed above, the workers' enthusiasm for production greatly increased, and the daily output of shirts increased to 1,450 pieces. The average daily output per worker increased from 15 pieces to 24 pieces.

　　订定纪律发起竞赛
    中原被服厂产量提高
    【新华社中原二十日电】中原被服第二厂的第二缝纫厂经过启发革命觉悟和发扬民主等办法，把新来厂工作的工人组织和发动起来，展开了立功运动。该厂成立不及两月，大部工人来自郑、洛、汴各城市，原系各自独立经营，不习惯集体生活，加以厂内各种制度尚不健全，所以开始时工作松懈散漫。上工时间虽规定为上午七时半，但有时到了九时工人还未到齐。全厂五十部机器，按正常产量每日应做衬衣一千件左右，但却只做七百五十件至八百件。为纠正此种现象，该厂乃提出支援前线的口号，启发工人广泛讨论，使他们认识积极生产的重要。工人们于讨论后纷纷成立生产小组，订出生产计划。厂方乃又提出组织工厂管理委员会，由工人选举积极分子三人，及经理与生产检查员各一人组成。该会当确定工作时间，订定劳动纪律，成立了伙食管理委员会，并发起立功运动。经过了上述所列的教育与整顿后，工人生产情绪大增，衬衣日产量已增至一千四百五十件。每个工人每日平均产量由十五件增至二十四件。
