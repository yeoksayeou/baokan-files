Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 7th: TASS, Bucharest, 4th: Since the implementation of land reform in Romania in 1945, landlords still owned as much as 50 hectares of land (one hectare equals sixteen Chinese acres). The so-called "model farms" all remained in private hands. Landlords and "model farm" owners have never taken any measures to make their land beneficial to Romania's national economy. They have been using these lands to exploit the laboring peasants. They deliberately damaged agricultural equipment, tools, and buildings, used inferior farming methods, and obstructed the laboring peasants from increasing the reproduction rate of livestock in various ways. In view of this, the Romanian government has promulgated a decree confiscating the land and farm implements of landlords and so-called "model farm" owners. The Romanian Communist Party's newspaper "Scanteia" published an editorial, pointing out that the decree will eliminate the landlords' sabotage and destruction in the countryside. The editorial cited many examples of landlords engaging in open sabotage and destruction. The editorial declared: This just step by the government will benefit the lives of the laboring peasants and raise the living standards of all working people. According to "Scanteia," when the peasants heard about this government decree, they immediately expressed their gratitude to the National Assembly and the Republic government.

　　Note: On March 22, 1945, the new Romanian People's Democratic Government, without the participation of reactionary parties, promulgated the Land Reform Law. The law stipulated the confiscation of all landlord land exceeding 50 hectares and distributed it to landless peasants and peasants with less than five hectares of land. Article 2 of the Land Law stipulated that certain lands should be reserved for industrial schools and model experimental farms. The Land Law originally stipulated that these lands should be managed by the state. After the implementation of the Land Law, as of September 1947, 726,000 peasants had received 1.4 million hectares of land from more than 1,100 large landlords.

　　罗民主政府颁布新法令
  　没收地主的土地和农具
    【新华社陕北七日电】塔斯社布加勒斯特四日讯：罗马尼亚自一九四五年实行土地改革以后，地主仍拥有多达五十公顷（一公顷合十六华亩）的土地。所谓“模范农场”全部留在私人手中。地主与“模范农场”场主根本没有采取过什么措施，使他们的土地有利于罗马尼亚的国民经济。他们一直在利用这些土地剥削劳动农民。他们故意毁坏农业设备、农业工具与建筑物，使用劣等耕种法并用种种方法阻碍劳动农民提高牲畜的生殖率。有鉴于此，罗国政府已颁布一项法令，没收地主与所谓“模范农场”场主的土地与农具。罗共机关报“斯堪提亚”报发表社论，指出该法令将消灭地主在农村中的怠工与破坏。社论援引了许多地主进行公开怠工破坏的事例。社论宣称：政府的这一正义步骤，将有利于劳动农民的生活，与提高全体劳动人民的生活标准。据“斯堪提亚”报报道，当农民们听到政府的这一法令时，立即表示感激国民议会与共和国政府。
    　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　
    按：一九四五年三月二十二日，没有反动政党参加的新的罗马尼亚人民民主政府，颁布了土地改革法。该法令规定没收一切超过五十公顷的地主土地，分给无地农民及土地少于五公顷的农民。土地法第二条规定，保留某些土地作为工业学校与模范实验农场之用。土地法本来规定这些土地应由国家管理。土地法实施后，截至一九四七年九月止，有七十二万六千农民从一千一百多个大地主手中分得了一百四十万公顷土地。
