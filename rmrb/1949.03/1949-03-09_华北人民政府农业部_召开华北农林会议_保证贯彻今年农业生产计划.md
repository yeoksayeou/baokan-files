　　North China People's Government Ministry of Agriculture
    Convened the North China Agriculture and Forestry Conference
  　To ensure the implementation of this year's agricultural production plan
    [Report from this newspaper] The Ministry of Agriculture of the North China People's Government convened the North China Agriculture and Forestry Conference on January 6th to discuss the 1949 agricultural production plan and agricultural technology work. More than 200 people attended the meeting, including the heads of agricultural departments of various administrative offices, the directors of various agriculture and forestry bureaus, farm managers, agricultural and forestry technical cadres, and cadres from various directly affiliated units of the Ministry of Agriculture, lasting for more than ten days. First, based on the reports of Minister Song and Deputy Minister Zhang, the conference studied the basic overview of agricultural production in the North China region and the environment in which the current large-scale production movement is located. It was believed that the large-scale production movement in 1949 was unfolding on the basis of the completion of land reform in basic areas, the basic victory of the war in the North China region, and the existence of large cities and modern industrial transportation. This was unprecedented in the past ten years. At the same time, we also have several years of production foundation and leadership experience, which provides full conditions for carrying out a large-scale production movement and increasing agricultural production by an inch. However, we are still in scattered rural areas with backward production technology. Especially after ten years of devastation and destruction by the Japanese invaders and the Kuomintang bandit army, agricultural production has decreased by more than 20% compared to pre-war levels. Therefore, the central task of our agriculture is still recovery, seeking development from recovery.
    Subsequently, based on the draft agricultural production plan drafted by the Ministry of Agriculture, and combined with the actual situation in various regions, the conference studied it in detail, proposing that agricultural production should increase grain production to ensure military and civilian food supplies and supply large cities. At the same time, it is necessary to increase the production of industrial raw materials to ensure the start of urban factories and exchange urban industrial products to supply the needs of farmers' lives and production. This year, the entire North China region is required to increase the average yield per mu by five sheng of grain (market sheng, calculated based on the original harvest), and areas with good conditions can appropriately increase it, while newly recovered areas can appropriately reduce it; increase cotton production, increase oil crop production, plant more and produce more crops, and increase the planting of feed crops. Strive to restore pre-war levels within three years.
    In terms of how to implement the plan and ensure increased production, in addition to discussing various effective measures in the agricultural production plan, it also focused on reviewing the problems existing in past production leadership and proposed the direction of future efforts:
    The conference first reviewed that in some aspects of agricultural production in the past, due to the lack of a long-term construction perspective and overall thinking, many mistakes had been made: such as unplanned land reclamation and beach repairs, which destroyed good land; advocating sideline occupations and calling for a large amount of charcoal burning and pine soot burning, cutting down tens of thousands of mature pine trees; areas without textile habits still planned to achieve textile self-sufficiency in three years; areas with low cotton yields still advocated cotton planting. This was correct during the Anti-Japanese War when it was blockaded and divided by the enemy for a long time, and a self-sufficiency policy was adopted. Now that the liberated areas have been connected into one piece and the situation has changed, we should not only understand the local situation, but also understand the overall situation, anticipate the future, pay attention to the production of industrial raw materials, ensure the development of industry, establish a long-term construction perspective and overall thinking, overcome blindness, and strengthen planning. Secondly, we also have a state of anarchy and lack of discipline in agricultural production. For example, the "straightening bends" of the Zhili River in southern Hebei has increased the flood control work in central Hebei. Reclaiming mountain wastelands in the northern Yue and Taihang Mountains has increased the floods in central and southern Hebei. Opening canals rashly without calculating the amount of water. Promoting to the masses when the experiment is not yet certain. Major policy decisions contradict the regulations of higher authorities without asking for instructions. This kind of bad phenomenon has made us suffer a lot. In the future, we should clarify responsibilities, stipulate discipline, and strictly correct the phenomenon of each doing its own thing and disregarding the overall situation. Secondly, the organizational work of strengthening agricultural production was also discussed, and it was decided to establish specialized management organizations for various specialized undertakings such as sand control and afforestation, breeding of draught animals, opening canals and digging wells, developing waterwheels, and improving agricultural implements, clarify tasks, and strictly define responsibilities, so that organizational work can be combined with agricultural management and technical guidance, to support undertakings with undertakings, and to develop undertakings with undertakings.
    The leadership of farmers to organize and mobilize women was also examined and studied. It was believed that the mutual aid and cooperation movement in the past had played a great role in ensuring cultivation, overcoming disasters, and resolving the contradictions between war service and production; however, due to the impatience of cadres and the mandatory orders in their work style, many detours were also taken. Therefore, the future approach should be: (1) Adhere to the principle of voluntary mutual benefit, allowing free joining and free withdrawal, and strictly prohibiting mandatory orders. (2) The organizational form should be small-scale and seasonal, and it is advisable to adopt the method of organizing when there is a need and disbanding when there is no need. On this basis, gradually improve it as much as possible. (3) Advocate small-scale cooperation combining agriculture and sideline occupations, and in some areas with conditions, professional cooperatives and promotion agencies can also be organized. (4) Mutual aid and cooperation organizations are strictly prohibited from being used as administrative organizations. (5) To mobilize and organize mutual assistance, we must use patient persuasion, typical demonstrations, and gradual promotion and gradual improvement methods. Compulsory orders are wrong, and laissez-faire is also wrong. (6) The leadership should not only study its organizational form, but also focus on studying its actual effects and experience. (7) Advocate short-term labor markets, organize the sale of livestock and tools to expand the adjustment of labor and animal power. The mobilization of women to participate in agricultural production and the organization of military dependents' production were also discussed. There are more than 6 million women with full labor force in the entire region. If more than half of them can be mobilized to participate in agricultural production, a strong force will be added.
    The conference also reviewed the past technical work, believing that we have achieved results in improving agricultural technology in the past few years, but due to the past neglect of technical work in production leadership in many areas and the failure to seriously organize the improvement of technology; many technical personnel also have a purely technical perspective, so the achievements are not great. In the future, we must have organized leadership to lead the masses to carry out improved technical work. This is not only a matter for technical personnel and professional organizations, but all rural organizations and rural workers should lead the masses to carry out agricultural technical improvement movements.
    The tasks of larger farms directly led by various administrative offices are defined as experimentation, promotion, breeding, and training of technical cadres. County farms are uniformly changed to promotion farms, with promotion work as the main focus, supplemented by breeding. Link up the large and small farms and promotion farms in various places to form a technical promotion network. Farm experiments and research should first solve the greatest and most urgent demands of farmers, have a unified plan, and clearly divide labor according to agricultural regions. The past promotion work was also reviewed, and it was believed that the promotion of improved varieties, prevention and control of diseases and insect pests, and three-season afforestation had all played a certain role, but it was far from enough, and there were serious shortcomings, such as insufficient organization and improvement of mass technology; the necessary techniques were not taught to the masses at the same time as the promotion of improved varieties; the pure breeding work of improved varieties was rarely done, and the mandatory order style in the promotion work should be strictly corrected. It is also stipulated that all levels of farms are uniformly led by the governments at all levels in administration, and accept the leadership of the higher-level farms in technology.
    In addition, the conference also conducted specialized technical discussions, exchanged experiences on various specialized technologies such as varieties, pests, forestry, animal husbandry, and water conservancy, and initially resolved the current technical disputes. Such as: (1) Should cotton be pruned? In the vast cotton-producing areas of the plains, Si-character cotton should not be encouraged to be pruned. In some cold areas, other cotton species should not be prevented from pruning if the masses have the habit of pruning. Special areas and special seeds can also be pruned, but should continue to be studied. (2) After debate, Jin Huanghou Yujiao was considered a very good variety, but it is easy to degenerate, and repeated hybridization reduces the yield. The Taihang area, which has been widely promoted, will no longer be promoted, but should pay attention to the breeding of purebred work. Jinzhong and Taiyue can be promoted on a small scale, and attention should also be paid to maintaining purebred and technical guidance. (3) Xinyu stone alkali surface and large gray water are temporarily decided not to be promoted if there is no certainty of mastering the technology. Under certain conditions, medicines can be promoted after testing without drug damage. (4) The comparison between 811 Valley and Huanong No. 4 Valley should continue to be tested, but both valleys are very good varieties and should be promoted.
    A reference room was also set up in the meeting, with charts of various plans, specimens of various improved varieties and pests, Chinese and Western insecticides, commonly used agricultural instruments, and photos of agricultural promotion team activities, which also greatly helped the conference.
    Finally, Deputy Minister Zhang made a summary report, emphasizing that the success of this conference was mainly due to sufficient preparation in advance. The Ministry of Agriculture and various administrative offices have done preliminary investigations and research, collected materials, and put forward draft plans, so that many problems can be solved in a short period of time. The conference officially closed on the 16th.

　　华北人民政府农业部
    召开华北农林会议
  　保证贯彻今年农业生产计划
    【本报讯】华北人民政府农业部，于一月六日召开华北农林会议，讨论一九四九年农业生产计划及农业技术工作，会议由各行署农业处长、各农林局长、农场场长、农林技术干部及农业部各直属单位干部二百余人参加，历时十余日。大会首先根据宋部长、张副部长的报告，研究了华北区农业生产基本概况及目前大生产运动所处的环境。认为一九四九年的大生产运动是在土地改革在基本地区已经完成、战争在华北区已基本上胜利；有了大城市及现代化工业交通的基础上展开的，这是十年来所未有；同时我们也有了几年来的生产基础与领导经验，这对开展大规模的生产运动，使农业生产提高一寸，有了充分的条件。但我们仍然处于分散的农村，生产技术落后，特别是经过十年来日寇及国民党匪军的摧残破坏，农业生产比战前降低了百分之二十以上，因而我们农业中心工作还是恢复，从恢复中求发展。
    大会随即根据农业部所草拟的农业生产计划草案，结合各地区实际情况，详加研究，提出在农业上应增产粮食，保证军需民食，并供给大城市；同时要增产工业原料以保证城市工厂开工，并换取城市工业品以供给农民生活及生产的需要。本年要求全华北区每亩平均增产五升粮食（市升，按原收获物计算），条件好的地区还可适当提高，新收复区可酌情降低；要求增产棉花，增产油料作物，多种多产作物，增植饲料作物。争取在三年内恢复战前水平。
    在如何贯彻计划保证增产方面，除讨论了农业生产计划中的各种有效措施外，并着重的检讨了过去生产领导上存在的问题，并提出今后努力的方向：
    大会首先检讨到过去在农业生产的某些方面上，由于缺乏长期建设观点与全局思想，曾犯了不少错误：如无计划的开荒修滩，冲毁了好地；提倡副业号召大量烧木炭、烧松烟砍伐了几万成材松树；没有纺织习惯地区仍然计划三年做到纺织自给；种棉收获量小的地区仍然提倡种棉，这在抗战时期长期被敌封锁分割，采取自给政策是正确的，现在各解放区已连成一片，形势已经改变，因此就不应只了解本地情况，也要了解全局，预计将来，注意生产工业原料，保证工业的发展，树立长期建设观点与全局思想，克服盲目性，加强计划性。其次我们在农业生产中也存在着无政府无纪律状态，如冀南治河“裁弯取直”，即加重了冀中的防水工作，北岳太行开垦山荒，冀中、冀南便加重了水灾。不计算水量即冒然开渠。试验尚无把握即向群众推广。重大政策决定与上级规定抵触亦不请示。此种不良现象已使我们吃亏不少，今后应当明确责任，规定纪律，严格纠正各自为政不顾全局的现象。其次对加强农业生产的组织工作，也做了讨论，决定在各种专门事业上如沙荒造林，繁殖耕畜，开渠凿井，发展水车，改良农具等方面，建立专管组织，明确任务，严格职责，使组织工作与农业经营技术指导结合起来，以事业养事业，以事业发展事业。
    对领导农民组织起来，发动妇女，也做了检查与研究，认为以往的互助合作运动，对于保证耕作，克服灾荒解决战勤与生产的矛盾，曾起了很大作用；但由于干部思想上的急性病与作风上的强迫命令，也走了不少弯路。因此今后的作法应是：（一）坚持自愿两利原则，允许自由加入自由退出，严禁强迫命令。（二）组织形式以小型的，按季节的分散的形式为宜，多采用有需要就组织，不需要就解散的办法。在这个基础上，加以可能的逐步的提高。（三）提倡农副业结合的小型合作，在某些有条件地区，并可组织专业性的合作社、推进社等。（四）互助合作组织严禁当作行政组织使用。（五）发动组织互助要用耐心说服，典型示范，逐步推广，逐步提高的方法。强迫命令是错误的，放任自流也是不对的。（六）领导上不只要研究其组织形式，更应着重研究其实际效果与经验。（七）提倡短工市，组织牲口卖犋以扩大劳畜力的调剂。在发动妇女参加农业生产与组织军属生产上也做了讨论。全区有女全劳力六百余万，如能发动半数以上参加农业生产，即增加一批强大的力量。
    大会对过去技术工作，也做了检讨，认为几年来我们在农业技术的提高上，曾获有成绩，但由于过去不少地区在生产领导上轻视技术工作，不认真组织技术的提高；不少技术人员又存在着单纯技术观点，因此成绩不大。今后要有组织的领导群众进行改良技术工作，这不仅是技术人员与专业组织的事情，一切农村组织与农村工作者均应领导群众进行农业技术改良运动。
    各行署直接领导的较大农场，其任务规定为试验、推广、繁殖与训练技术干部，县农场一律改为推广场，以推广工作为主，辅之以繁殖。把各地大小农场推广场联结起来，组织成为一个技术推广网。农场试验研究，应首先解决农民最大的最迫切的要求，要有统一的计划，依据农业区域明确分工，对过去的推广工作，亦做了检讨，认为在推广优良品种防除病虫害以及一年三季造林等技术的推广方面，都起了一定作用，但是十分不够，而且存在着严重的缺点，如组织与提高群众的技术不够；推广优良品种没有同时把必需的技术教给群众；繁殖优良品种的纯种工作做的很少，以及推广工作中强迫命令作风等，都是应该严格纠正的。并规定各级农场在行政上一律受各级政府领导，在技术上接受上级农场之领导。
    此外大会并进行了专门技术座谈，就品种、虫害、林牧水利等各种专门技术交流经验。并初步的解决了目前技术上的争论问题。如：（一）棉花是否应该整枝？在广大平原产棉地区斯字棉不应提倡整枝，在某些寒冷地区其他棉种群众有整枝习惯的不制止，特殊地区特殊种籽亦可整枝但应继续研究。（二）金皇后玉茭经过争论认为是很好品种，但容易退化，一再杂交就减低了产量，已推广普遍的太行区，不再推广，而应注意繁殖纯种工作，晋中、太岳可在小范围内推广，亦应注意保持纯种与技术指导。（三）信石硷面大灰水，暂决定在没有把握掌握技术的不推广，在一定条件下药品经过试验无药害的可以推广。（四）八一一谷与华农四号谷的比较应继续试验，但两种谷都是很好品种，都应推广。
    会中并布置有参考室，内有各种计划的图表及各种优良品种病虫害的标本及中西杀虫药剂，常用的农业仪器，和农业推广队活动的照片等，对大会亦有很大帮助。
    最后由张副部长做总结报告，着重指出这次大会的成功，主要由于事先有了充分准备。农业部及各行署都做了初步的调查研究，搜集材料提出计划草案，因此才能在短时期内解决了不少问题。大会于十六日正式闭幕。
