　　Tianjin Public Enterprises Mostly Complete Inventory
　　Military Control Commission Takes Over Puppet Agricultural and Forestry Institutions
Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, March 5th: The inventory of materials in various public enterprises taken over by the Tianjin Military Control Commission is now mostly complete. Due to the participation and assistance of employees in the inventory process, the work has generally been accurate and rapid, and a large amount of materials not included in the accounts has been identified. To prevent fraudulent practices such as the substitution of similar materials, the No. 1 Factory of the Tianjin China Textile Branch Company implemented classified handover procedures for all parts, tools, and machines, with important components being re-examined. The No. 2 Steel Factory adopted a method of checking materials against the inventory list and then checking the inventory list against the materials. Special attention was also paid to outstanding IOUs from various departments, eliminating loopholes where borrowers did not check and those who lent did not check either. Therefore, all materials in the factory, from the smallest gram weights to heavy iron blocks, were checked without any omissions. Employees demonstrated great enthusiasm in the inventory work. Under the precise inspection of "every item must be checked," some employees who attempted to be perfunctory or even cheat had to carefully correct the inventory list. Li Youzhi, a material clerk at the Tianjin Enterprise Company Machine Factory, said: "It has never been this clear before. We used to think that when the People's Liberation Army came to take over, it would be done haphazardly, but this time it is truly careful, and everything that was not entered into the accounts has been found and entered." Almost all units cleared out materials that were not included in the accounts. The No. 2 Steel Factory alone cleared out 1,349 kinds, including more important equipment such as compressors and electric clocks. The Zhangguizhuang Railway Factory cleared out materials that had been privately stored in the city branch for a long time and were not included in the accounts, even exceeding the amount on the books. Tools that had been lost for many years and were most needed by the factory were also found in this inventory. Some workers have already carried out preliminary sorting of the inventoried materials.
　　Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, March 5th: The agricultural and forestry institutions of the former Kuomintang in Tianjin have been completely taken over by the Agricultural and Forestry Department of the Tianjin Military Control Commission. These include ten units such as the Hebei Reclamation Farm of the Puppet Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry, the Hebei Provincial Bureau of Agricultural Land, the Junliangcheng Work Station of the Beiping Agricultural Experiment Station, the Tianjin Cotton Improvement Office, the Marine Fisheries Supervision and Fish Market of the Jidong District, the Chadian Cooperative Farm of the Hebei Provincial Department of Social Affairs, the Hebei Branch of the Mechanical Land Reclamation Management Office of the Relief and Rehabilitation Committee, the Tianjin Transfer Office of the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry, and the Hebei Representative Office of the Promotion Committee of the Puppet Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry. Among them, the Hebei Reclamation Farm, the Hebei Provincial Bureau of Agricultural Land, the Junliangcheng Work Station of the Beiping Agricultural Experiment Station, and the Chadian Cooperative Farm of the Hebei Provincial Department of Social Affairs, have a total of 81 farms, including 125,393 mu of paddy fields, 38,598 mu of dry land, and 4,582 mu of orchards. The main crop is rice, with a yield of 400 to 1,000 jin per mu. In terms of agricultural area equipment, the Xiaozhan agricultural area was originally the best, with complete modern water equipment and a large scale. However, under the rule of the Kuomintang bandit gang, the equipment of the fourteen farms in the agricultural area was completely destroyed. At present, the Junliangcheng agricultural area with six farms has the best equipment, including 22 electric motors, 23 water pumps, and other water conservancy equipment. In mid-February, the Agricultural and Forestry Department of the Military Control Commission convened a meeting of the heads of various taken-over units. At the meeting, it was unanimously requested that a unified leadership structure be established as soon as possible to unify the leadership of the agricultural institutions in the Tingu district. In order not to delay the farming season, the department has formulated a specific plan to launch spring plowing, which is about to be implemented.

  　军管会接收伪农林机构
    【新华社天津五日电】天津市军管会所接管各公营企业单位中的物资清点工作，现已大部完成。由于在进行清点中吸收职工们参加协助，清点工作一般地做到准确、迅速，并清查出大量漏在帐目外的资材。在清点中为防止同类物资前后顶替等舞弊现象发生，天津中纺分公司第一厂对一切零件、用具、机器等，均实行分类点交，重要的机件还进行复查。钢铁二厂则采用按物资对清册，再按清册对物资的办法，同时对各部门的借支票据等亦特别注意，消除了借者不点、被借者也不点的漏洞。因此，该厂一切资材从最小单位的法码到笨重的铁块，均无一遗漏地全部经过了查点。职工们在清点工作中表现非常积极。在“件件必点”的精密检查下，某些企图马虎了事、甚至想从中作弊的职员，不得不仔细地订正清册。天津企业公司机器厂的材料员李友智说：“过去从来没有这样清楚，我们从前想解放军来接管还不也是马马虎虎的，但这次却真是仔细，把没有入帐的都查出来入帐了。”几乎所有单位都清出了漏在帐外的物资，仅钢铁二厂即清出一千三百四十九种，其中有较重要的器材如压缩机与电钟等。张贵庄铁路工厂清出在市内分所中私存已久的漏在帐外的材料，甚至超过帐存数量。该厂遗失多年而且是工厂最缺的工具，在这次清点中也查出来了。工人们对于清点过的物资，有的已进行了初步整理。
