　　In Preparation for the Workers' Representative Assembly
　　Tangshan Factories and Mines Launch Elections
　　Handan-Shexian Railway Actively Prepares to Establish a Workers' Union
    [Tangshan Electric Dispatch] Under the assistance and promotion of the Tangshan Federation of Trade Unions Preparatory Committee's Provisional Committee, the workers' preparatory committees of various factories and mines in the city are actively carrying out the work of establishing workers' representative assemblies. The Qixin Cement Company Workers' Representative Assembly has been formally established. From the 24th of last month, all factory workers, after four days of enthusiastic elections, successfully completed the process by the 27th, electing a total of 35 worker representatives. Workers at the Kailuan Tangshan Mine are also enthusiastically conducting elections these days to elect their representatives and group leaders. The mine's workers' preparatory committee issued a notice on the 25th of last month, stipulating that elections should begin on the 26th and be completed by mid-March. Because the number of workers in various departments of the Kailuan Mine is large and the work is divided into above-ground and underground operations, making communication difficult, the election period was set at half a month to allow the elections to proceed in an unhurried manner. The 26th and 27th were designated for elections by workers in above-ground departments, March 1st to 10th for underground workers, and after the 10th for staff elections. A secret ballot method is used, and representatives and group leaders are elected according to each work unit. Each group of candidates must be approved by at least fifteen people, and then the candidate himself or a nominated person makes an election introduction before voting begins. Every day's election is tense, sometimes lasting from morning until sunset, and the workers' election enthusiasm is very high. Some workers spend money to buy red and green paper, write election slogans or leaflets, and post them everywhere. The election is still in progress and is expected to be completed smoothly before March 15th. Other factories and mines, such as the Railway Bureau, Steel Plant, and Porcelain Factory, are also preparing for elections.
    [Taihang Electric Dispatch] The Handan-Shexian Railway Workers' Preparatory Committee was formally established last month and is now actively working to establish a formal workers' union. The meeting was convened by the Provisional Preparatory Committee on the 9th of last month, with a total of 26 worker representatives from the entire section attending. At the meeting, Comrade Geng Zhenlin, director of the Provisional Workers' Preparatory Committee, first explained the significance of the meeting. Then, the participants broke into groups to discuss the resolution on the tasks of the workers' movement from the Sixth National Labor Congress. After two days of discussion, everyone clearly recognized that they have become masters of society in the liberated areas, have the right to participate in the operation and management of enterprises, and that the administrative leadership of state-owned enterprises is only a public-private relationship, not a labor-capital relationship, resolving many confused ideas. Everyone proposed: We should do everything possible to build our railway well and more effectively support the front line to strive for a swift victory in the national liberation war. In addition to warmly receiving the worker representatives, the administrative leadership also reported on the business, income, expenditure, and management situation, reviewed the insufficient work done in the past on welfare work, and accepted the suggestions and criticisms of the workers, proposing to strengthen this work in the future. Finally, the meeting studied in detail the issues of trade union organization, tasks, and worker welfare (cooperation, health, safety), elected thirteen preparatory committee members, and formally established the preparatory committee.

　　迎接职工代表大会
  　唐市厂矿开展竞选
    邯涉铁路积极筹备建立职工会
    【唐山电】在唐山职工总会筹委会临时委员会的协助推动下，全市各厂矿的职工筹委会都在积极进行成立职工代表大会的工作。启新洋灰公司职工代表会，已经正式成立，从上月二十四日起，全厂职工经过四天热烈选举，至二十七日已胜利完成，共选出职工代表三十五名。开滦唐山矿职工连日也正热烈进行选举，选出他们的代表和小组长。该矿职工筹委会于上月二十五日发出通知，规定二十六日开始选举，至三月中旬完毕。因为开滦矿各部门职工人数众多，工作又有井上与井下的分别，不易联系，所以定选举时间为半月，使选举得以从容进行。计二十六、七两日为井上各部门工友选举，三月一日至十日为井下工友选举，十日以后为职员选举、用不记名投票法，按各工作单位选出代表及小组长，各组候选人至少要十五人同意，然后由候选人本人或推举人作竞选介绍，才开始投票。每天的选举，有的从上午到日没，终日紧张，工人竞选情绪非常热烈；有的出钱买了红绿纸，写上竞选标语或传单，到各处去贴。现选举仍在继续进行中，预计于三月十五日以前，可以顺利完成。其他铁路局、制钢厂、磁厂等厂矿也分别在筹备选举中。
    【太行电】邯涉铁路职工筹委会已于上月正式成立，现正积极进行成立正式职工会的工作。会议由临时筹委会于上月九日召开，到会全段职工代表共二十六人。会上首由临时职工筹委会主任耿振林同志说明了开会意义后，随即分组对全国六次劳大关于职工运动任务的决议展开讨论，经过两天讨论，大家都明确认识了自己在解放区已成了社会的主人翁，有参加企业经营管理的权利，和国营企业行政领导上只是公私关系，并非劳资关系，许多糊涂思想都得到了解决。大家提出：应尽一切力量把自己的铁路建设好，更有效地支援前线，争取全国解放战争迅速胜利。行政领导上除对职工代表热情招待外，又将营业、收入、支出、管理等情况做了报告，过去对于福利工作做的不够也作了检讨，并接受了职工的建议和批评。提出今后要决心加强这门工作。会议最后详细的研究了工会组织、任务和职工福利（合作、卫生、安全）等问题，选举了十三个筹备委员，正式成立了筹委会。
