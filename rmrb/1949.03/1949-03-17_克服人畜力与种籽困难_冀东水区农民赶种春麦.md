　　Overcoming Difficulties with Manpower, Animal Power, and Seeds
  　Farmers in the Jidong Waterlogged Areas Rush to Plant Spring Wheat
    [Jidong Electric] Farmers in Yuutian, Baodi, Sanhe and other places are planting spring wheat. To overcome the shortage of manpower and animal power, they have joined together in mutual aid. A large number of women have also participated in the wheat planting labor. In Yucun Village, Yuutian District 8, farmers organized six mutual aid teams, and all 130 women in the village participated in the labor. Villager Gao Junmin, along with his mother and wife, used human power to pull a plow and plant 15 mu of wheat. In Yangjiabanqiao, District 9, more than 100 households without livestock formed mutual aid groups to plant wheat by pulling the "bentzi" (a type of farming tool) manually. The mutual aid group formed by Chen Hongqi and other four families completed planting 17 mu in three days. The entire district has planted 35,950 mu of spring wheat.
    Villages in Baodi District 12 were looted and burned by Chiang Kai-shek's bandit troops in 1946, resulting in a severe lack of agricultural implements and livestock. Under the leadership of the county production work team, farmers have voluntarily formed groups to plant wheat on the existing foundation. In Wuma Village, 47 households organized into 12 groups to rush the planting; all the women in the village participated. Seven villages in the district planted more than 2,000 mu of spring wheat in two days.
    In the eleven flood-affected villages near Xinji Town, Sanhe District 4, a large amount of wheat is being planted to prevent famine. The government has also issued loans of 450,000 yuan (Renminbi) to help solve the difficulty of obtaining wheat seeds. Currently, farmers in various villages are rushing to plant day and night. Incomplete statistics for Wangfuying and Longwan villages alone show that over 2,000 mu have been planted.
    [Jidong Electric] In order to expand the area of spring wheat planting in the waterlogged areas (areas often affected by floods along the banks of the Grand Canal) of Yutian, Baodi, Ninghe and other counties, the Fifteenth Special District continued to provide loans of 500,500 jin of wheat seeds on the 3rd of this month. It is estimated that the above counties will increase the planting of spring wheat by more than 36,000 mu. The public-owned stores in each county are responsible for supplying these wheat seeds. Each county and district has already received its allocation and is actively distributing it to the villages.
    Furthermore, farmers in the first and eleventh districts of Bitian are promoting the spirit of mutual assistance and fraternity, and are taking out surplus wheat seeds to lend to the waterlogged areas that lack wheat seeds. Farmers in the eleventh district have taken out a total of 5,000 jin. Farmers in the upland areas of the first district, in order to help farmers in the waterlogged areas of the district solve the difficulties of wheat planting, have also lent out 2,800 jin of wheat seeds and a portion of livestock to the waterlogged areas to help with wheat planting. Wages are freely negotiated between the two parties.

  　冀东水区农民赶种春麦
    【冀东电】玉田、宝坻、三河等地农民播种春麦中，为克服人、畜力的不足，纷纷搭伙互助，大批妇女也参加了种麦劳动。玉田八区于椿庄农民组织了六个互助组，全村一百三十名妇女全部参加了劳动。村民高俊民和母亲、妻子三人，用人拉犁种麦十五亩。九区杨家板桥百余户没有牲口的农民结成互助小组，用人拉坌子种麦。陈洪奇等四家结成的互助组，三天即种完十七亩。全区已播完了三万五千九百五十亩春麦。
    宝坻十二区一带村庄，于一九四六年曾遭蒋匪军抢掠焚毁，农具、牲畜都很缺乏，在县生产工作队领导下，农民已在旧有基础上自愿结组种麦。五麻村有四十七户组织成十二个小组抢种；全村妇女都参加了。该区七个村在两天内即播种春麦两千余亩。
    三河四区新集镇附近十一个水灾村，为防止粮荒，大量种麦。政府并发放贷款四十五万元（人民币）帮助解决了麦种困难。现各村农民正日夜赶种。仅王福营、龙湾二村不完全统计，即已播种二千余亩。
    【冀东电】十五专署为扩大玉田、宝坻、宁河等县水区（即运河两岸常遭水灾地区）种春麦面积，于本月三日继续贷放麦种五十万零五千斤。估计上述各县共增种春麦三万六千余亩。此项麦种由各县公营商店负责供给。现各县区均已支领完毕，正积极向各村发放中。
    又毕田一、十一两区农民发扬互助友爱精神，纷纷拿出多余麦种，贷给缺乏麦种的水区。十一区农民共拿出了五千斤。一区高地农民为了帮助该区水区农民解决种麦困难，亦借出麦种二千八百斤及一部份牲口到水区帮助种麦。工价由双方自由商订。
