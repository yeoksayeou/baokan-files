Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 10th. The Sun Ke cabinet of the Kuomintang puppet government submitted its "collective resignation" to the puppet acting president Li Zongren on the 8th, and it has been approved. In his resignation, Sun Ke admitted that the Kuomintang government's efforts on the peace issue "have lasted for two months without much success, and looking ahead, there are still many difficulties." Therefore, it should "take the blame," that is, it should confess its crimes. Among other items of confession, Sun Ke pointed out that the Kuomintang government's "conscription of soldiers and grain has deep-seated malpractices, which should be abolished early to alleviate the people's suffering." However, due to the continuation of the counter-revolutionary war, "these bad policies still exist, and the people are waiting and watching." Sun Ke also pointed out that due to the continuation of the counter-revolutionary war, "military expenditures are increasing daily, and the burden on the national treasury is heavy," and "the rise in prices is still severe, and the people's suffering has not been eliminated." Strangely, this reactionary "government," which considers itself to be hindering peace, continuing the war, oppressing the people, and exploiting the people, does not demand that the people give it the punishment it deserves after confessing its crimes, but continues to demand so-called "glorious peace." Although there is a power struggle between the Sun Ke group and the Li Zongren group, Sun Ke's absurd attitude represents most of the reactionaries in the Nanjing Kuomintang government. Sun Ke's resignation is not enough to indicate that the Kuomintang government has stopped being reactionary or reduced its reactionary nature. The Kuomintang's various reactionary forces are only trying their best to seek internal compromise under the direction of the United States, in order to raise their own status. To this end, puppet acting president Li Zongren and U.S. imperialism are maintaining close contact. On the 7th of this month, the day before Sun Ke announced his resignation, Li Zongren and Bai Chongxi held secret consultations with U.S. Ambassador to Nanjing Stuart, Commander of the U.S. Western Pacific Fleet Badger, and U.S. Navy Admiral Bogner, who recently arrived in Nanjing from Guam. According to reports, after Bai Chongxi arrived in Nanjing from Hankou on the 19th of last month, he immediately visited Stuart. Afterwards, four U.S. military attachés visited Bai Chongxi. Bai has obtained Li Zongren's consent and decided to send representatives to the United States to establish direct contact with the U.S. military.

　　在美帝指挥下寻求内部妥协
    孙科反动内阁“总辞职”
    南京伪政府并未减少反动性
    【新华社陕北十日电】国民党伪政府的孙科内阁已于八日向伪代总统李宗仁提出“总辞职”，并已被批准。孙科在辞呈中承认国民党政府对于和平问题“历时两月，尚鲜成就，盱衡前途，困难犹多”，因此应当“引咎”，就是说，应当认罪。孙科在其他的认罪的项目中，指出国民党政府“征兵征粮，积弊之深，允宜早予取消，以苏民困”，但是由于继续反革命战争，至今“秕政犹存，四民观望”。孙科又指出，由于继续反革命战争，“军费之支出日繁，国库之负担繁重”，“物价之上涨仍剧，民生之疾苦未除”。奇怪的是这个自认为妨碍和平、继续战争、压迫人民、剥削人民的反动“政府”，在招罪之后，却并不要求人民给以应得的惩办，而继续要求所谓“光荣的和平”。尽管孙科集团与李宗仁集团中间存在着权力的斗争，但是孙科的这种荒谬的态度却代表着南京国民党政府中的大部分反动派。孙科的下台并不足以表示国民党政府已经停止反动或减少反动。国民党各派反动势力只是在美国指挥下竭力寻求内部的妥协，以图借此抬高自己的身价。为此目的，伪代总统李宗仁与美帝国主义间正保持着密切接触。本月七日，即孙科宣布辞职的前一日，李宗仁和白崇禧一起与美国驻南京大使司徒雷登、美国西太平洋舰队司令白吉尔及新近由关岛来南京的美海军上将包纳尔举行秘密协商。据息，白崇禧上月十九日由汉口抵南京后，曾立即去拜访司徒雷登，事后美武官四人又赴白崇禧处访问。白已商得李宗仁同意，决派遣代表赴美，以便与美国军方取得直接联系。
