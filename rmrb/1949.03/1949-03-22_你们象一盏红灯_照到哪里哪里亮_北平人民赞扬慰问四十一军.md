　　【Beijing News】On the 17th of this month, the Forty-first Army, which is guarding the city of Beiping, received a total of 932 letters of appreciation from people from all walks of life in Beiping, including workers, students (including universities, middle schools, and elementary schools), and citizens. The letters fully expressed the sincere love of the broad masses of workers, students, and citizens of Beiping for their own army. They also resolutely expressed that they must actively support the People's Liberation Army, cross the Yangtze River, and liberate all of China. Especially the workers, expressed that they must work hard to produce and support the war, so as to wipe out the Kuomintang reactionaries as soon as possible. As worker Cui Zifeng from the Pingjin Railway Bureau said in his letter: "...Since you entered the city, whether it is discipline, dealing with people, etc., you have shown that you are an amiable and lovely people's army. In the future, we will definitely work actively in the rear to support you in crossing the Yangtze River." Zhang Guiqin, a worker from the towel department of the women's handicraft factory, said in her letter: "...You are the giant waves of the times, washing away the dirty and corrupt everywhere,... We will definitely work hard to produce and support you in the future." The workers of the Engineering Section of the Pingjin Railway Bureau even patiently drew four beautiful watercolor paintings, packed them in envelopes and sent them to the soldiers of the People's Liberation Army. One was "The banner of victory flying over the land of the whole country," the second was "The bugle of liberation resounding through the sky," the third was "A gift for the enemy—explosives," and the fourth was "Let the enemy's tanks and artillery turn to ashes." The students of major, middle, and elementary schools also expressed their condolences to the soldiers of the People's Liberation Army in an extremely affectionate and sincere manner. They talked about their feelings as if they were friends they had not seen for many years. Sun Shuxian, a student at Beijing Normal University, said in her letter: "We have been praying day and night, waiting for you to liberate us with eager anticipation. You have finally arrived. From then on, we jumped out of the tiger's den of the Kuomintang reactionaries, saw the light again, and breathed the air of true freedom." Liu Pusheng, a student at Tsinghua University, began by writing: "Dear comrades: Although we have never met, and I do not know your names, this does not diminish my respect for you, because I know that you are our own army—the soldiers of the heroic and good-fighting People's Liberation Army..." Wu Guozhuang, a student at the Fourth District Fourth Bao Elementary School, wrote: "Comrades of the People's Liberation Army: Your discipline is really good since you came here: sweeping the floor for the people, carrying water for the people, and being kind to people. It really makes me happy, so I want to write a letter to express my condolences to you." Li Ronglan, a fifth-grade elementary school student at the school, wrote: "Wherever you go, the people there are liberated; you are like a red lantern, shining light wherever you go." Everyone not only extended warm greetings, but also unanimously hoped that the soldiers of the People's Liberation Army would continue to work hard, cross the Yangtze River, and liberate all of China. Many university students wrote excitedly on the letters: "We have also joined the southward work group and will cross the Yangtze River with you!" When the soldiers of the People's Liberation Army saw these letters of appreciation, they also cheered excitedly, and resolutely expressed, "We will use practical actions to respond to the appreciation and hopes of the workers, students, and citizens of Beiping for us."
