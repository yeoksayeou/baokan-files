　　Labor Model Liu Luoyin of Shulu
  　Introduces Experience of "Nine Survivals Out of Ten Plantings"
    [Our Dispatch] Liu Luoyin, a labor model from the old city of Shulu, plants trees every year with a success rate of nine out of ten. He has accumulated some experience, and since tree planting is underway in various places, he is now sharing his experience:
    For spring planting, begin as soon as the ground thaws. This year the weather is dry, so planting should start even earlier. For fruit trees, dig a pit until you find moist soil, then bury the sapling well, firmly compacting the soil. Next, bend the tip of the tree down, dig a small trench, and bury the tip with soil. Wait until the beginning of summer to uncover it and expose it to the sun and wind, burying it with a thin layer of soil from time to time (do not compact the soil tightly), because the buds are very tender and cannot withstand wind and sun. Later, the leaves will gradually emerge from the soil on their own. For planting willow trees, dig a pit about two feet deep, and water the pit. After the water has seeped in, it is best to let it warm in the sun for one to two days before burying the sapling, compacting the soil firmly to prevent contact with the wind. If a strong wind arises, pay attention to timely inspection, and ensure that there are no cracks in the soil around the tree to prevent it from being exposed to the wind. For planting cypresses, poplars, locust trees, and other trees with roots, you may initially refrain from watering and water them after a few days. While watering, shake the tree trunk with your hand so that the water flows down to the roots. After the mud turns into moist soil, compact the soil firmly and cover it with a mound of dry soil.

　　束鹿劳模刘洛银
  　介绍十栽九活经验
    【本报讯】束鹿旧城劳动模范刘洛银，他年年种树十栽九活，积累了一些经验，现在各地都在植树，现在把经验介绍一下：
    春天植树，地一开冻即开始种。今年天气干燥更应早种，如植果木树坑刨出湿土即可，将树秧埋好，把土砸实，然后将树尖弯倒，刨一道小沟，用土埋上树尖。等到立夏刨开见一下太阳和风，随时埋上一层薄薄的土（不要把土砸好），原因是树芽很嫩，经不起风吹太阳晒，以后叶子渐渐的自己露出土皮。栽柳树坑刨二尺左右，用水浇坑，等到水渗完后，为了使树坑发暖，顶好晒一天至两天，再把树秧埋上，把土砸实，不让和风接触。如刮起大风可注意及时检查，树周围的土不要有纹道，以防受风。栽柏树、杨树、槐树等有根的树，先不浇水也可，过几天再浇。一面浇水，一面用手摇摆树身，水即顺树往下流到树根，等到泥变成湿土后，可用力将土砸实，再用干土封上一个土堆。
