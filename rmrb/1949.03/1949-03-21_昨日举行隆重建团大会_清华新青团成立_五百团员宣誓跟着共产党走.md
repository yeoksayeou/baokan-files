    Five Hundred League Members Swear to Follow the Communist Party
    [Our Newspaper] The Tsinghua University General Branch of the China New Democratic Youth League solemnly held its founding congress at the Tsinghua University Auditorium on the afternoon of the 20th. Five hundred and twenty-six league members took the oath to join the League. After the chairman delivered a speech, representatives from the Tsinghua Professors' Association, Teachers' Union, Trade Union, Student Self-Government Association, Women Students' Association, Housewives' Association, and the Preparatory Committee of the Yanjing New Communist Youth League delivered speeches in succession, jointly congratulating the establishment of the Tsinghua New Communist Youth League. They praised Tsinghua students' heroic struggle against American imperialism and Kuomintang rule in the past, and encouraged the Tsinghua New Communist Youth League members to carry forward their glorious tradition, fulfill the historical task of supporting the Liberation War, and building a New Democratic New China. Comrade Feng Wenbin gave a brief report to the congress on behalf of the Preparatory Committee of the National Congress of the China New Communist Youth League. Amidst the majestic military music of the Liberation Army March, the Tsinghua Trade Union, Teachers' Union, and Student Self-Government Association presented flags to the congress. Finally, five hundred and twenty-six league members raised their right hands under the portrait of Chairman Mao and gloriously swore: "To be humble and sincere, to be pragmatic, to always follow the Communist Party, to constantly study Mao Zedong Thought and cultural and scientific knowledge, to intensify our self-transformation, to be willing to sacrifice everything, to serve the working people loyally, to guarantee to make the greatest effort for revolutionary construction, and to fight to the end for the complete realization of New Democracy in China." An entertainment soiree was held after the meeting to celebrate.
