To Liu Haihan, Chao Xusheng, Wu Fengrui, Xun Chen, Jin Wu, and Li Zhenrong: Based on the situations you have described, if your marital relationship has been broken down for a long time and you cannot continue living together, as long as one party requests it, you can apply to the government for divorce proceedings. As for Zhenrong's concern about his uncle and aunt's disapproval, they have no reason to interfere.

To Dai Yushu: Regarding the men in your village who have married female famine refugees from other places, if they were all of legal marriage age at the time and it was voluntary, such marriages are fully protected by law. As for the woman's parents wanting to take her back, there is no reason for this. If the feelings between both parties are not good, and it is an arranged or mercenary marriage, then that's another matter.

To Mr. Liu Guigen: Regarding your marriage without obtaining a marriage certificate and the resulting dispute with your wife's former in-laws, we suggest that if both parties voluntarily married but did not obtain a marriage certificate, you can of course go through the procedures to obtain a supplementary certificate. According to what you have described, your wife's former in-laws have no right to demand that you divorce.

　　离婚结婚自己作主
    刘海汉、巢虚生、吴凤瑞、训臣、今吾、李振荣诸君：根据你们所说的情况，你们夫妻情感既已破裂很久，而不能再继续生活下去，只要有一方提出，即可向政府请求办理离婚手续。至于振荣君说叔婶不允许的问题，他们是没有理由干涉的。
    戴玉树君：你所提你村的男子，很多的与外来逃荒女子结了婚，他们当时都满结婚年龄，而又是自愿的，这种婚姻完全受法律保障。至于说女方家长要把女方带回去是没理由的。如果双方感情不好，又是包办的买卖婚姻，那又另当别论。
    刘桂根先生：关于你结婚而没有领结婚证，以及引起你妻的原婆家同你闹纠纷的问题，我们意见，双方自愿结婚后，没有领结婚证，当然可以办理补领手续。按照你所说的情形，你妻的原婆家是没有权利要求你们离婚的。
