　　Implementing Takeover by System
　　Avoids Confusion
    The second is the implementation of the method of takeover by system. Each department of the Property Management Committee took over the various units of the Kuomintang military, political, political-economic, logistical, health, transportation, telecommunications, and real estate industries in Peiping (such as the Ministry of Health taking over the health departments, and the Logistics Department taking over the logistics departments). First, they took over their important leading agencies and controlled important materials, and then took over according to the agency system. This was orderly and avoided confusion. For example, the takeover of ordnance work adopted the method of "sealing up weapons according to system." The "Joint Office" issued a circular ordering the original heads of various agencies to order the collection, and no problems occurred. This proves that takeover by system is a very good method for taking over materials in large cities. The third is the military representative system. For the takeover of each unit, the committee sent military representatives to be responsible for implementation. Military representatives generally had a high level of policy understanding and strong work ability, and formed military representative teams. The organization of the military representative team should be lean and efficient, and the number of people should not be too large. They were responsible for mastering and leading the takeover work, implementing policies, understanding the situation, and creating work experience. Under the military representatives, liaison teams or liaison officers were set up to assist the military representatives in carrying out the takeover. The liaison officers went deep into the masses, understood the internal situation of each unit to be taken over, discovered and cultivated activists, and assisted in the progress of the takeover work.

    第二是实行了按系统接管的方法，由物管会各部门按系统接管北平伪国民党军政、政经、后勤、卫生、交通、电讯、房地产业各单位（如卫生部接管卫生部门，后勤部接管后勤部门），先接管其重要主管机关，掌握重要物资，然后按机关系统进行接管，这样有条不紊，避免了混乱现象。如接管军械工作，采取“各按系统封存武器”方法，由“联办”通令各机关原负责人下令收缴，未发生什么问题，证明按系统接管是接管大城市物资的很好方法。第三是军事代表制度。接管每一单位，均由该会派出军事代表负责执行，军事代表一般政策水平较高、工作能力较强，组成军事代表小组。军事代表小组的组织要精干，人数不必过多，负责掌握与领导接管工作，执行政策，了解情况和创造工作经验。在军事代表之下设联络小组或联络员，协助军事代表进行接管，联络员深入群众，了解各接管单位的内部情况，发现和培养积极分子，协助接管工作的进行。
