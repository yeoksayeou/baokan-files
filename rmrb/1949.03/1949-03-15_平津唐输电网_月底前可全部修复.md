　　Tianjin-Beijing-Tangshan Power Grid
  　To be Fully Restored by the End of the Month
    [Reported by this newspaper] The Tianjin-Beijing-Tangshan power grid of the Northern Hebei Electric Power Company is expected to be fully restored by the end of this month. In the future, the three regions can flexibly use electricity and share resources. Currently, the Tangshan Power Plant can generate 19,000 kilowatts. In addition to supplying electricity to Tangshan, Tanggu, and Hangu, it can export 6,000 kilowatts to compensate for the shortage in Beijing and Tianjin, and save the transportation costs of Kailuan coal. The Beijing Shijingshan Power Plant can now generate up to 34,000 kilowatts, and can transmit more than 15,000 kilowatts to Tianjin during the day for industrial use. The electricity fees collected can supplement the financial shortfall of the Beijing branch of the Electric Power Company.
    The transmission line between Tianjin and Tangshan was restored as early as the 6th of this month. During the Liberation Army's attack on Tianjin, the Kuomintang army destroyed a six-kilometer section of 77,000-volt high-voltage line and all the utility poles from Nancang to Tianjin, resulting in heavy losses. The Northern Hebei Electric Power Company convened a meeting of the heads of the Tianjin and Tangshan electric power branches in Beijing on the 7th of this month to decide to actively overcome material difficulties and restore the grid as soon as possible. After a week of searching, exhausting all the resources of the electric power companies in Beijing and Tianjin, they finally found enough high-voltage lines and 60 pairs of utility poles and 180 strings (five each) of porcelain insulators and other important materials. The missing hooks have also been rushed to completion by the repair shop of Hebei Electric. The line repair workers are scheduled to depart on the 16th on an engineering crane truck and use machinery to speed up the repairs, which are expected to be completed before the end of the month.
    In addition, the boilers of the Beijing Shijingshan Power Plant are too old and may be damaged at any time. They can be washed in rotation when the power from Tangshan is transmitted to Beijing.

　　平津唐输电网
  　月底前可全部修复
    【本报讯】冀北电力公司平、津、唐输电网，本月底前可全部恢复，今后该三地电力即可灵活使用，互通有无，现唐山发电厂可发电一万九千千瓦，除供给唐山、塘沽、汉沽三地用电外，尚可余六千千瓦输出以补平津之不足，且能节省开滦煤的运输费用。北平石景山发电厂现可发电至三万四千千瓦，昼间可余一万五千千瓦以上输送天津、供工业用电，所收电费，可补电力公司北平分公司经济之不足。
    津、唐间之输电线早已于本月六日修复。平津间南仓至天津六公里长的一段七万七的高压线及所有电杆于解放军进攻天津时被国民党军队破坏，损失惨重。冀北电力公司于本月七日召集津、唐两电力分公司负责人来平开会，决定积极克服材料困难，尽速修复。经一周的搜集，穷平、津两地电力公司之所有，始搜足所需之高压线及高压线用的六十对电杆和一百八十串（每串五个）瓷瓶等重要材料，不足之挂钩也由冀电的修造厂赶制完毕。修线工人定于十六日乘工程起重卡车出发，利用机械赶修，预计月底以前完工。
    又北平石景山发电厂锅炉过于老旧，随时有损坏可能，俟唐山电能输送来平时即可轮流洗刷。
