[Jinzhong Electric] Yu County's state-owned stores have adopted measures such as maintaining consistent steps with local public stores and maintaining close contact with administrative management organs, enabling local prices to maintain a steady upward trend over the past year, providing preliminary experience in mastering prices in small cities. Yu County is an agricultural area, and the market mainly regulates farmers' necessities, such as cloth, cotton, oil, and salt. Due to the widespread crop failure in the county the year before last, grain prices gradually rose before the autumn of last year, and cloth, cotton, oil, and salt were all lower than grain prices. After the new grain was on the market in the fall, grain prices once plummeted, but from October, they showed an upward trend. For example, the rice price index was 100 in early October, 85 in late October; 103.3 in early November, 141.6 in late November; 150.5 in early December, 179.1 in late December; 164.4 in late January of this year; 244.5 in early February, and 229.4 in late February. The following are some experiences and lessons learned by state-owned stores in stabilizing prices: (1) The consistent steps of state-owned stores with various public stores and close cooperation with administrative management organs are the central key to stabilizing prices. In late November of last year, all public stores implemented physical capital preservation and controlled grain. As a result, Yangquan Baoxing Coal and Iron Store and Xinglonghao purchased grain in large quantities in Yu County. At that time, the state-owned store in Yu County was also responsible for purchasing grain, so a chaotic situation of competing for grain occurred in the market, causing grain prices to rise by 14% in one day. The state-owned stores and the Industry and Commerce Department of the Special Commissioner's Office immediately convened a joint meeting of public stores and banks to review the market competition phenomenon and decided that the state-owned stores would uniformly purchase and allocate a certain amount to Baoxing Coal and Iron Store and Xinglonghao during price fluctuations, thus stabilizing grain prices. Subsequently, the special district, the county industry and commerce section, state-owned and public stores, and banks jointly formed an economic committee, stipulating that the surrounding friendly neighboring areas' market conditions should be reported every half month, and the local price situation and the problems that occurred should be studied. (2) State-owned stores have strong economic strength to buy and sell, which is also an important factor in stabilizing prices. Because in market transactions, the main items are grain and cloth, and the price fluctuations of other items are transferred with the rise and fall of grain prices. At each market, the proportion of grain purchased by state-owned stores is generally more than 60%, which can control the market. When grain prices fluctuate, state-owned stores sell a certain amount of grain, which can stabilize grain prices. Because general speculative private merchants often temporarily piece together speculation in price fluctuations, they do not have long-term accumulation strength themselves. Therefore, during the two grain price fluctuations in late December last year and the Lunar New Year, speculative private merchants attempted to take advantage, but under the large-scale buying and selling of state-owned stores, they had to sell at a loss. With stable grain prices, general prices are also stable. (3) It is necessary to master market conditions and seasonality. Yu County's surplus grain is often supplied to the Yangquan industrial and mining area. Last winter, due to the special situation near the Shouyang war zone, the masses in the rear purchased grain near the battlefield to pay public grain. The main grain market was Shouyang. The grain prices in Yu County generally followed the grain prices in these two regions, taking into account the freight for transporters. This not only maintained the appropriate price of grain but also made it profitable for transporters, avoiding abnormal rises and falls; however, when the new grain was on the market after the autumn, attention was not paid to mastering it well, and grain prices fell by one-half, and private merchants profited from it, causing farmers to suffer undue losses. It was not until October that the Jinzhong District Trading Company arranged grain purchase tasks, and the time was already a bit late. (4) State-owned banks should promptly contract loans and tighten currency during price fluctuations. Banks used this method to play a significant role in stabilizing prices last winter. However, sometimes the steps between state-owned stores and banks are still not consistent enough, leaving speculative gaps for private merchants.

　　掌握市场打击奸商
  　盂县保持物价平稳上升获经验
    【晋中电】盂县国营商店采用与当地各公营商店步调一致，并与行政管理机关保持密切联系等办法，使当地物价一年来始终保持平稳上升趋势，提供了在小城市掌握物价的初步经验。盂县为农业区，市场多系调节农民必需品，如布、棉、油、盐等。由于前年全县普遍歉收，去年秋前粮价逐渐上升，布、棉、油、盐等均低于粮价。秋后新粮上市，粮价曾一度暴跌，但十月开始，即呈上升趋势。如十月上旬米价指数为一零零，下旬为八五；十一月上旬为一零三点三，下旬为一四一点六；十二月上旬为一五零点五，下旬为一七九点一；本年一月下旬为一六四点四；二月上旬为二四四点五，下旬为二二九点四。现将国营商店在稳价工作中的几点经验教训分述如下：（一）国营商店与各公营商店步调一致，并与行政管理机关密切配合，是稳定物价的中心关键。去年十一月下旬，各公营商店都实行实物保本，掌握粮食。于是阳泉宝兴煤铁店、兴隆号都在盂县城大批收购粮食。当时盂县国营商店也担负着收购粮食任务，因之市场上发生了争购粮食的混乱现象，致使粮价一日曾上涨百分之十四。国营商店及专署工商部门即召开公营商店及银行联席会议，检讨市场争购现象，并决定：在物价波动中由国营商店统一收购，分配给宝兴煤铁店、兴隆号一定数量，遂使粮价平稳下来。嗣后，专区与县工商科、国营、公营商店及银行合组经济委员会，规定半月一次汇报周围友邻区商情，与研究当地物价情况及所发生的问题。（二）国营商店在经济上拥有雄厚的吞吐力量，亦是稳定物价的重要因素。因市场交易中，主要是粮、布，其他物价均以粮价升降为转移。每集市，国营商店收购粮食比例一般在百分之六十以上，即可控制市场。在粮价波动的时候，国营商店抛售一定的粮食，便可使粮价稳定。因为一般投机私商往往是在物价波动中临时东拼西凑地投机倒把，其本身并没有长期积存力量。所以去年十二月下旬与旧历年关两次粮价波动，投机私商曾企图取巧，但在国营商店大量吞吐下，不得不赔价出卖粮食。粮价稳定，一般物价也就平稳了。（三）必须掌握行情与季节性。盂县剩余粮食常年是供给阳泉工矿区的，去年冬天又由于接近寿阳战区的特殊情况，后方群众在战地附近购买粮食交纳公粮，粮食主要市场是寿阳，盂县城粮价一般是随着这两地区的粮价，而照顾运销者运费，这样既保持了粮食的适当价格，也使运销者有利可图，避免发生不正常的涨落现象；但秋后新粮上市，没有注意很好掌握，粮价曾下降二分之一，私商从中取利，致使农民遭受了不应有的损失。直至十月间，晋中区贸易公司才布置了购粮任务，时间已经晚些了。（四）国营银行在物价波动中，应及时收缩贷款，紧缩货币。在去年冬季平稳物价中银行用这种办法，起了很大作用。但有时因国营商店及银行间步调仍不够一致，给私商留下投机的空隙。
