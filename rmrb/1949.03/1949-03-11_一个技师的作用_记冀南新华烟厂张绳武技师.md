　　The Role of a Technician
  　Remembering Zhang Shengwu, Technician at the Ji'nan Xinhua Cigarette Factory
    Lin Li
    Zhang Shengwu is a technician at the Xinhua Cigarette Factory. He understands electricity, mechanics, and basic chemistry. He operated large machines at the Yenching Paper Mill in Beiping, served as a professor in the Automotive Repair Department of a certain industrial university in Tianjin, and was an engineer at a certain Feihuang Factory (egg-beating factory) in Anyang. When he first arrived at the Xinhua Cigarette Factory, he often wondered, "How much can a cigarette factory technician contribute to the revolution?" He considered establishing a large-scale mechanical paper mill. However, he recalled the lessons of many years of impractical dreaming, "It's better to start from reality and existing conditions!" So, he planned to mechanize the main production links of the cigarette factory.
    At that time, the factory he was in was still in the stage of manual hand-cranked cigarette machines. Watching the workers strenuously crank the machines, taking turns every ten minutes or so, and still sweating profusely, with cigarettes coming out uneven in thickness... From his perspective of operating large machines, this was unbearable: "Power is a must!" He suggested that the factory equip power.
    "Power? That thing is so unruly! When it turns, it roars, and you can't even tell it to slow down." said some technical opponents who didn't understand power.
    "Power is the most scientific and obedient!" He explained to people: "Just change to a slow-speed wheel, and it will turn as many revolutions per minute as you want it to; if you want it to slow down, it can slow down; if you want it to stop, it stops immediately. It also produces more cigarettes and can overcome the problem of uneven thickness." The factory leaders supported his opinion and accepted his suggestion. Soon, a fifteen-horsepower diesel engine replaced human labor.
    "His proficiency with machinery goes without saying," Manager Zhou of the cigarette factory told me. "More importantly, it's his attitude towards work. He openly shares his technology, is never intimidated by difficulties, and doesn't use difficulties to scare people. He solved many problems himself, and we didn't even know it."
    He is good at thinking deeply and researching. Although he had the convenience of being familiar with machinery, he had never seen cigarette machines or cigarette factories at all. He wanted to mechanize every important production link of the cigarette factory, so he had to think about every problem from the most primitive starting point. For example, he saw that when the stems were removed from the tobacco leaves, the leaves were used to make cigarettes, and the stems were sold at ten times lower than the price of the leaves. So he thought: Are the stems useful? If they're useless, why does anyone buy them? His investigation revealed that large quantities of tobacco stems were transferred to Shanghai via Jinan and Qingdao. He didn't advocate selling the stems anymore, but how to turn something we considered useless into something useful? After considering and inquiring, he decided to manufacture a stem-pressing machine.
    Strangely enough, when he recently went to a certain city, he suddenly discovered the wreckage of a stem-pressing machine in a pile of various machines bombed beyond recognition by American-made Chiang planes, "That can save a lot of trouble!"
    The wreckage of the broken machine shortened his design and drawing time and served as his manufacturing roadmap. He borrowed the broken machine and automatically proposed to manufacture stem-pressing machines sufficient for all public cigarette factories in North China. Now, the new stem-pressing machine is operating at an efficiency of pressing 1,000 catties of stems per day.
    Technician Zhang once took me to the stem-pressing machine. He picked up a pressed tobacco stem and said, "Look, this is even thinner than tobacco leaves!" He then grabbed a handful of shredded tobacco leaves and asked me to compare the smell of the two. He said, "Can you smell it? The smell of the stem shreds isn't much different from the leaves, is it?" He laughed heartily. Then, pointing to the stack of tobacco stems in the yard outside the window, he told me that tobacco stems worth three or four hundred yuan per catty had turned into three or four thousand yuan. According to the current machine, pressing 1,000 catties of tobacco stems a day, that means that the people are earning an extra three or four million yuan every day in disguise. He called my name: "Comrade Lin, you calculate, how much is this pile of tobacco stems, which is taller than two rooms, worth? How many days can it be pressed? And how many such tall stacks of tobacco stems do all the public cigarette factories in North China have, you say?..."
    "Stem-pressing machines for all public cigarette factories in North China?..." I was afraid that he hadn't completed the task and was embarrassed to ask further, but he immediately continued, "It's already been successful, just waiting for them to come and transport them."
    Turning to the side of the tobacco shredding machine, he said that he always felt uncomfortable with the old shredding machine. The blade opening was an inch wide, protruding two or three inches from the machine body; judging from the rotational speed of the belt, it couldn't produce more finished products, yet it could only shred 200 to 300 catties a day, and it was always prone to clogging. He changed this situation, changing the blade opening to five inches wide, from a fixed blade to a live blade, and adding half-inch thick boards on both sides of the tobacco feeding channel. Since then, the problem of clogging has been overcome, and the output has increased to 400 to 600 catties per day.
    Every machine in the cigarette factory, large and small, contains Technician Zhang's hard work. Especially the large cigarette-making machine, which will soon be put into operation, is more like a new creation of Technician Zhang than an imported one. Because the machine was bombed beyond recognition and was incomplete in a certain place by Chiang's planes. This time, new parts accounted for the majority of the installation. The effect of his installation of the large cigarette-making machine will be many times greater than that of the stem-pressing machine and the improved shredding machine!

　　一个技师的作用
  　记冀南新华烟厂张绳武技师
    林里
    张绳武是新华烟厂的技师，他懂得电学、力学和普通的化学，开过北平燕京造纸厂的大机器，当过天津某工业大学汽车修理部的教授、安阳某飞黄厂（即打蛋厂）的工程师。当他最初到新华烟厂的时候，他总想：“一个烟厂的技师，对革命能有多大贡献？”想开办一个规模巨大的机械造纸厂。但他又回忆起多年空想的教训，“还是从现实与现有条件出发吧！”于是他就计划着要把烟厂的主要生产环节机械化。
    那时，他所在的工厂还处于人工手摇卷烟机的阶段。他看着工人用力地将机器摇动，每十多分钟换个人，还累得满头大汗，烟又出得粗细不匀。……以他开动大机器的观点看，这实在不能忍受：“非用动力不可！”他建议厂方设备动力。
    “动力，那家伙多不听指挥！转起来喔里轰隆，想叫它慢点也不能。”某些不懂得动力的技术反对者。
    “动力最科学，最听指挥了！”他向人们解释着：“只用改个慢速轮，要它每分钟转多少转，它就转多少；想叫它慢，它能慢；叫它停，它立刻停住。烟还出的多，又能克服粗细不匀的毛病。”工厂负责同志支持他的意见，并接受了他的建议。一个十五匹马力的柴油机，不久代替了人力。
    “他对机械的熟练，是用不着多说的。”烟厂周经理告诉我：“更重要的是他对工作的态度。他技术公开，从来不被困难吓倒，也不以困难来吓人。有许多困难他自己想法解决了，我们还不知道。”
    他善于深思和钻研，虽说他有熟悉机械的便利，但他对于卷烟机与卷烟厂是根本没有见过的，他要把烟厂每一重要生产环节机械化，因此，一切问题他就不能不从最原始的起点想起。比如，他看见烟叶去了梗，叶子做烟，梗子以低于叶价的十倍卖了。于是他想：梗子是否有用？假若没用，又为什么有人买？他调查的结果，一大车一大车的烟梗，都经济南、青岛而转上海了。他不主张再出卖烟梗，但是怎么把这我们看作没用的东西变成有用？他考虑与询问的结果，决定制造一架压梗机。
    说也奇怪，他于最近去某城，在一堆被美制蒋机轰炸得破烂不堪的各种机器里，他忽然发现一架压梗机的残骸，“还可节省了好多事！”
    破机器的残骸，缩短了他设计、绘图的时间，并做了他的制造路线。他把破碎的机器借来，并自动提出制造足供华北各公营烟厂的压梗机，现在，新的压梗机，已以每日压梗一千斤的效率在开动了。
    张技师曾带我到压梗机旁，他抓起压过的烟梗说：“你看，这比烟叶还薄哩！”他又抓起一把烟叶的丝，让我比较两者的味气，他说：“你可以闻得出来吧？梗丝的味气比叶子也不差甚呢？”他哈哈地笑着。随又指向窗外院里的烟梗垛，他告诉我，值三四百元一斤的烟梗，已变成了三四千元，就按目下的一架机器，一天压一千斤烟梗计，就是说，无形中每天给人民多收入了三四百万元。他叫着我的名子：“林同志你算算看，这一堆比两间房还高大的烟梗，该值多少钱？能压多少天？我们华北所有的公营烟厂，你说又有多少个这末高大的烟梗垛？……”
    “供给华北各公营烟厂的压梗机？……”我恐怕他没有完成任务，不好意思问下去，但他立时接过去：“已经成功了，只等他们来运了。”
    转过切烟丝的机器旁边，他说他对旧的切丝机，总看着不顺劲。刀口立寸宽，突出机身两三寸；从轮带的旋转速度看，它不能产出更多的成品的，然而一天只能切二百到三百斤，而且总好堵塞。他把这种情况改变了，刀口换成五寸宽，由死刀口变成活刀口，进烟道的两旁又镶了半寸厚的板，从此，堵塞的弊病克服了，产量每天提高到四百斤至六百斤。
    烟厂的大小机器，每一部上都有张技师的心血。特别是不久即将开动的大卷烟机，与其说是外来的，勿宁说是张技师新造的。因为机器曾于某地遭蒋机轰炸，破烂不堪，残缺不全。这次装置，新制零件占大半。他装置大卷烟机的功效，不知要超出设备压梗唆与改进过切丝机的多少倍！
