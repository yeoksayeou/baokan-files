　　The North China People's Government Issues
    Measures Regarding the Treatment of Students at Worker and Cadre Schools

    [Reported by this newspaper] The North China People's Government recently formulated regulations regarding the treatment of students at the North China Worker and Cadre Schools, and on the 21st of this month, instructed all administrative offices, provincial governments, directly-administered municipalities, and relevant departments to comply and implement them. The regulations are as follows: 1. All students of the North China Worker and Cadre Schools will uniformly enjoy the cadre supply system treatment stipulated by the North China People's Government. 2. In order to take care of the living conditions of the students' families, 60% of their original salary will be issued during the study period as a family subsidy. 3. All family subsidies for students will be paid by the state treasury, and the method of distribution is as follows:
    (1) Students from state-owned factories and enterprises whose families are near the original factory will be paid by the original factory or enterprise. (2) Students from state-owned factories and enterprises who voluntarily receive the subsidy at the school must hold a certificate from the factory or enterprise proving that their salary has been suspended, and the subsidy will be issued by the school to the student. (3) Students from private factories and enterprises will be issued the subsidy by the school, and they will send it to their families. (4) The time for receiving family subsidies for students will be calculated from the time they leave their production posts. Those who receive it from the original factory will be paid according to the original factory's pay schedule; those who receive it from the school will be paid by the school, once every half month. (5) For the convenience of calculation, all family subsidies received by the school will be converted into millet based on the original fixed salary at the time of arrival, and converted into Renminbi at the Tianjin market price each time the salary is paid. If the factory or enterprise adjusts the salary, the factory or enterprise shall notify the school of the adjustment result and pay it according to the adjusted amount. Those who receive it from the factories and enterprises will be handled according to the original factory's salary system. (6) The families of workers and employees from various factories and enterprises who come to the school to study will still be able to enjoy all the welfare benefits of the original factory or enterprise. (7) Young students who enter the school to study will not be eligible for family subsidy benefits. (8) These measures will be implemented from April, and the original treatment measures will be abolished.
