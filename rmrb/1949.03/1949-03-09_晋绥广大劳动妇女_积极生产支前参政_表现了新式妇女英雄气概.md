Xinhua News Agency, Xing County, 7th: The Third Women's Representative Conference of the Jin-Sui Liberated Area, convened on the 12th of last month, summarized the women's movement in the area over the past few years. After reviewing the history of the women's movement from the First Jin-Sui Women's Representative Conference in 1938 to the present, the conference believes that in the War of Resistance Against Japan, and especially in the People's Liberation War, the broad masses of laboring women in Jin-Sui have demonstrated the heroic spirit of new women in terms of production, support for the People's Liberation Army, and political participation.

(1) In terms of production: Since 1943, the broad masses of women in the region have launched a textile movement. In the harsh environment of the Kuomintang's economic blockade and the destruction by the Japanese invaders, they solved the problem of clothing for the military and civilians. In 1944, the women in the old textile areas of Lin County and Lishi produced 400,000 bolts of cloth (each bolt six zhang long), which were used by the local people themselves, with a surplus left over. In the new textile areas of Hequ and Baode counties, they also achieved self-sufficiency in clothing. The achievements of women's textile work can be illustrated by the following example. In Suodagan Village, where the women's textile hero Liu Nenglin lives, there are 244 households. In 1944, in addition to weaving cloth for their own use, the village wove 864 bolts of standard cloth for the public and earned 33,540 jin of wages in the form of grain. If they used the grain they earned to pay the village's public grain for the year, they would still have more than 10,000 jin left over. After the land reform in 1947, the broad masses of women farmers were allocated the same amount of land as male farmers, which further increased their enthusiasm for labor. In addition to continuing textile production, they also invested heavily in agricultural production. According to incomplete data, in the old and semi-old areas of Jin-Sui, the percentage of women participating in agricultural production last year was about 30 to 40 percent during spring plowing, 50 to 70 percent during summer weeding, and as high as about 90 percent during the autumn harvest. Because a large number of women participated in agricultural production, not only did the crops not suffer losses due to a large number of male farmers supporting the liberation wars on the Sui-Meng front and the Jin-Zhong front, but the autumn harvest was completed earlier than in any previous year, generally shortening the time by a quarter to a third compared to the past. As a result, a large number of male laborers were able to carry out autumn plowing, making last year's autumn plowing more extensive and faster than any previous year. Many women have learned general agricultural techniques, and some women have become production models, especially many family members of revolutionary soldiers. For example, Bai Zhaodi in Pianguan County and Li Fanzhuan in Hequ County both refused the help of the village farmers and cultivated all their land independently after their husbands joined the People's Liberation Army.

(2) In terms of supporting the People's Liberation War: After the land reform, rural women became more aware of the importance of defending their emancipation interests, so many women voluntarily sent their husbands and sons to join the People's Liberation Army. In the six counties of Lishi, Fangshan, and Shenchi, 30 percent of the new recruits who joined the People's Liberation Army last autumn were mobilized by women. They sewed military uniforms and made military shoes for the People's Liberation Army, ensuring the needs of the front lines. Last year alone, the women of the entire Jin-Sui Liberated Area made 890,000 pairs of military shoes, equivalent to three times the total number of military shoes made from 1939 to 1943, and also made 18,000 shoe soles, more than 135,000 single trousers, more than 136,000 cotton quilts, and 253,000 pairs of socks. In the villages along the way to the front lines, women warmly comforted the wounded and sick soldiers, providing tea, cooking meals, and washing and mending blood-stained clothes for the wounded. Women in Lishi County carried stretchers with lamps at night to transport wounded soldiers. In Yaowa Village, Baode County, there was a wounded soldier who was injured in the mouth and could not eat anything. The lactating women in the village squeezed their milk to feed the wounded soldier. Under their enthusiastic care, the army was greatly encouraged and comforted, and many wounded and sick soldiers were moved to tears.

(3) In terms of political participation: Women's political participation is the inevitable result of women's participation in production, support for the Liberation War, and the land reform struggle. After the land reform, 257 female cadres were elected to work in governments and organizations above the district level, bringing the total number to 615 including the original ones. Before the land reform, there were only 26 female cadres at the county level, but now there are 132. Female representatives account for about 15 percent of the general village people's representative conferences. These newly emerging female cadres and representatives were all elected by the masses because they were supported by the masses in their actual work. Therefore, they generally have a working style of closely contacting the masses, being democratic, and being hardworking, active, and enthusiastic. Many women have gloriously joined the Communist Party of China and the New Democratic Youth League. Before the land reform, female Communist Party members in the three counties of Lin, Pianguan, and Kelan accounted for only 4.38 percent of the total number of party members. After the land reform, although the proportion is still very low, it has increased by about one time compared to before. In all the villages and towns where the New Democratic Youth League has been established, there are female youths joining the League. According to statistics from the Lishi sub-district (covering Lishi, Lin, Fangshan and other counties), female League members account for 25.27 percent of the total number of League members, and the secretary of the Zhongyangcheng Youth League is a female League member. After overthrowing the feudal rule of the landlord class, the broad masses of peasant women have gradually raised their consciousness and actively opposed the oppression of residual feudal ideas, and opposed unreasonable phenomena such as arranged marriages, early marriages, and child brides. Secondly, they enthusiastically learn culture to overcome the shortcomings of ignorance caused by past poverty and the feudal idea of ​​"valuing men over women". Last winter, women attending winter school was a common phenomenon everywhere.

### 晋绥广大劳动妇女　积极生产支前参政  表现了新式妇女英雄气概

　　晋绥广大劳动妇女
  　积极生产支前参政
    表现了新式妇女英雄气概
    【新华社兴县七日电】上月十二日召开的晋绥解放区第三届妇女代表大会，总结了该区几年来的妇女运动。在回顾了自一九三八年晋绥第一届妇女代表会迄今以来妇女运动的历史以后，大会认为在抗日战争中，尤其是在人民解放战争中，晋绥广大劳动妇女无论在生产、支援解放军、参政等方面，都表现了新式妇女的英雄气概。
    （一）在生产方面：自一九四三年以来，全区广大妇女展开了纺织运动。在国民党经济封锁和日寇破坏的恶劣环境中，解决了军民的穿衣困难。一九四四年，临县、离石老纺织区妇女织的布，除本地人民自己穿用以外，还剩余了四十万匹（每匹六丈长）。在河曲、保德等县新纺织区也做到了穿衣自给。妇女纺织的成绩可以从下面这个例子得到说明。临县妇女纺织英雄刘能林所在的村庄——索达干村有二百四十四户人家，一九四四年该村除了织他们自己穿用的布以外，只给公家定织的标准布就织了八百六十四匹，赚得工资米三万三千五百四十斤。如果以她们所挣的工资米交当年全村的公粮，还能剩余一万多斤。一九四七年土地改革以后，广大的女农民分得了和男农民同等的一份土地，因之劳动热情更加提高，除了继续进行纺织以外，她们又大量地投入了农业生产。根据不完全的材料，在晋绥老区和半老区，去年一年中参加农业生产的妇女，在春耕中约百分之三十到四十，在夏锄中约百分之五十到七十，在秋收中则达百分之九十左右。由于广大妇女参加了农业生产，不仅没有因为大批男农民支援绥蒙前线和晋中前线的解放战争而使庄稼受到损失，反而使去年秋收结束得比任何一年都早，普遍地比过去缩短了四分之一到三分之一的时间。因此又使大量男劳动力可进行秋耕，使得去年秋耕比任何一年都多且快。许多妇女学会了一般的农业技术，有些妇女更作了生产模范，尤其是有许多革命军人家属。如偏关县白招弟，河曲县李反转，都是在男人参加解放军以后，谢绝了村中农民的帮助，独自耕种全部土地的。
    （二）在支援人民解放战争方面：经过土地改革以后，农村妇女更加认识了保卫翻身利益的重要，所以许多妇女自愿送夫送子参加解放军。离石、方山、神池等六县，在去秋参加解放军的新战士之中，有百分之三十是经过妇女动员的。她们为解放军缝军衣、做军鞋，保证了前方的需用。只在去年，全晋绥解放区妇女就做了军鞋八十九万双，等于一九三九年到一九四三年所作军鞋总数的三倍，又作了鞋底一万八千双，单裤十三万五千多条，棉被十三万六千多床，袜子二十五万三千双。在运往前线的沿途村庄，妇女们热情的慰问伤病员，为伤员烧茶、做饭、洗补血衣。离石县妇女在晚上也提着灯抬送伤兵。保德县窑洼村住有一个嘴上负伤不能吃东西的伤员，该村乳妇就把自己的奶挤下来给这位伤员吃。在她们这样热情爱护下，军队得到很大鼓舞和安慰，好多伤病员感动得流下泪来。
    （三）在参政方面：妇女参政是由于妇女参加生产、支援解放战争和土地改革斗争的必然结果。土地改革以后被选举到区以上政府和机关中工作的女干部有二百五十七人，连原有者共有六百一十五人。土地改革以前县级女干部只有二十六人，现在则有一百三十二人。一般村人民代表会议中女代表约占百分之十五。这批新起的女干部、女代表都是在实际工作中，为群众所拥护，被群众推选出来的，因此一般具有密切联系群众，办事民主和艰苦、积极、热情的工作作风。不少妇女光荣地参加了中国共产党和新民主主义青年团。土地改革以前，临县、偏关、岢岚三县女共产党员只占党员总数的百分之四点三八，土地改革以后，虽然比例还是很低，但是比以前却增加了约一倍。凡建立了新民主主义青年团的村镇，都有女青年入团，据离石分区（辖离石、临县、方山等县）统计，女团员占团员总数的百分之二十五点二七，中阳城青年团书记是由一个女团员担任的。广大农民妇女在打垮了地主阶级的封建统治以后，觉悟逐渐提高，都积极起来，反对残余封建思想的压迫，反对买卖婚姻、早婚和童养媳等不合理现象。其次，热情的学习文化，克服由于过去的贫困和“重男轻女”的封建思想所造成的盲昧无知的缺点。去冬妇女上冬学，已是各地普遍的现象。
