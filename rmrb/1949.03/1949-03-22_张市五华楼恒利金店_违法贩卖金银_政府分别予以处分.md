　　Zhangjiakou City Wuhualou Hengli Gold Shop
    Illegally Sells Gold and Silver
    Government Imposes Penalties
    [Zhangjiakou Telegram] The Wuhualou and Hengli Gold Shops in Zhangjiakou City were found to be selling silver and gold, disrupting the financial order. The People's Government has imposed penalties according to law. After Zhangjiakou City was liberated, the Zhangjiakou Military Control Commission issued a clear announcement, strictly prohibiting illegal activities such as buying and selling silver dollars and gold, which disrupt the financial order. On February 4th, the Chahar Branch of the People's Bank of China convened a meeting of managers of gold shops and silver houses in the city, reiterating that the business scope of gold shops was limited to the buying and selling of gold and silver jewelry. However, some speculators knowingly violated the regulations, undermining the policies and laws of the People's Government. On February 14th, during the first inspection of gold shops in Zhangjiakou City by the Chahar Branch of the People's Bank of China, it was discovered that Hengli Gold Shop had privately purchased two taels of gold. At that time, the manager of the shop was ordered not to move the gold and to await further action. Furthermore, on February 16th, during the second inspection, it was discovered that Wuhualou Gold Shop had sold one hundred silver dollars to Beiping at a black market price of 230 yuan in People's currency. After the Chahar Branch of the People's Bank of China reported the above situation to the Military Control Commission, the Military Control Commission decided on February 28th to confiscate the two taels of gold from Hengli Gold Shop. Zhang Ziheng, the manager of Wuhualou, as the chairman of the Gold Shop Association, knowingly violated the law and was handed over to the Zhangjiakou City People's Court for punishment according to the law. After the People's Court tried and ruled on the matter, Zhang Ziheng was fined 50,000 yuan in People's currency. In order to educate the managers of gold shops in the city with the above facts, the Chahar Branch of the People's Bank of China convened another meeting of managers of gold shops in the city on February 28th. In addition to announcing the criminal facts of Wuhualou and Hengli Gold Shops and imposing the due penalties, it reiterated the government's financial policies, stating that there would be no leniency for any further violations. The meeting also decided to remove Zhang Ziheng from his position as chairman of the Gold Shop Association.

    违法贩卖金银
    政府分别予以处分
    【张垣电】张家口市五华楼、恒利金店贩卖白银黄金，扰乱金融，人民政府依法分别予以处分。张市重获解放后，张市军管会曾明令通告，严禁买卖白洋、黄金等扰乱金融之非法行为。二月四日，中国人民银行察哈尔分行召集全市金店、银号业经理大会时也曾再三阐明：金店之营业范围，仅限于金银首饰之买卖。但仍有个别投机分子明知故犯，破坏人民政府政策法令。上月十四日，中国人民银行察哈尔分行，对张市全市金店业进行第一次检查时，发现恒利金店私购进黄金二两，当时除令该店经理不许移动黄金外，并听候处理。又上月十六日进行第二次检查时，又查获五华楼金店以人民券二百三十元之黑市价格，向北平卖出白洋一百块。经中国人民银行察哈尔分行将上述情况呈报军管会后，上月二十八日军管会决定予恒利金店没收二两黄金之处分，五华楼经理张子衡身为金店业理事长，知法犯法，送交张市人民法院按罪论处。经人民法院审理判决结果，予张子衡罚款人民券五万元之处分。为了拿上述事实教育全市金店业经理，人民银行察哈尔分行于二月二十八日再次召集全市金店业经理会议，除宣布了五华楼、恒利金店犯罪事实并予应得之处分外，又重复说明了政府金融政策，如有再犯，决不宽贷。会上并决定撤销张子衡金店业理事长之职。
