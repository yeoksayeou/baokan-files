　　Ma Xulun, Fan Wenlan, and Forty Others
    Hold Symposium on Reforming University Education
  　Advocate for Merging Departments and Reforming Curriculum
    [Our Newspaper] The Beiping Military Control Commission's Cultural Management Committee convened a "University Education Symposium" at the Beijing Hotel at 2:00 PM on the 14th. Attendees included: Ma Xulun, Fan Wenlan, Mao Dun, Sha Qianli, Zhou Yang, Huang Zhefu, Liu Qingyang, Wu Han, Yang Xiufeng, Shi Fuliang, Xu Deheng, Hong Shen, Li Jishen, Chen Shaoxian, Tian Han, Wang Kunlun, Chen Qiyuan, Hou Wailu, Sun Qimeng, Gao Chongmin, Kong De＠, Hu Zi'ying, Zhang Ximan, Zhou Jianren, Gao Zuwen, Yang Meizhen, Qian Xinbo, Huang Wei, Lei Jieqiong, Zhang Xiruo, Wang Shao, Deng Chumin, Zhang Manjun, Fu Dingyi, An E, Shen Zhiyuan, Lu Yudao, Xu Guangping, Chen Qiyou, Hu Yuzhi, Cao Mengjun, Zhang Pei, Hu Shouyu, Hao Renchu, and more than forty others. First, Comrade Qian Junrui, Director of the Cultural Management Committee, briefly clarified the New Democratic educational policy, explaining that the purpose of this symposium was to discuss: first, the curriculum reform and departmental adjustments of various national universities in Beiping; and second, the survival, abolition, and improvement of private universities. Subsequently, the attendees spoke enthusiastically. Ma Xulun recalled the history of running universities in China over the past thirty years. He believed that universities generally do not need to be private, and one place does not need many universities of the same nature; professors should be uniformly and systematically allocated by the state and can be used on a rotating basis. Hong Shen firmly advocated for the merger of universities, vehemently criticizing the feudal separatist phenomena such as small factions and gangs in schools under the rule of the Kuomintang reactionaries, and believed that the traditional concept of legalism must be thoroughly broken. Zhang Ximan believed that private universities with outstanding achievements in the past could exist, and courses in Party doctrine and theology in various schools must be abolished. Lei Jieqiong believed that the division of departments in the past was unreasonable and advocated for breaking the strict division of departments. Xu Deheng opposed the complete Westernization of education based on local culture, saying that this was feudal and comprador education; he advocated that engineering, agriculture, and medical colleges should also study social sciences, and that professor-led governance had played a progressive role in the past, but it is not necessary to emphasize it now. Shen Zhiyuan said: Merging departments can save manpower. He said: University should be completed in a maximum of three years, and the courses taken should not exceed thirty, and the class time should not exceed three hours per day. Sha Qianli believed that New China still needs its own people's laws, and the law department must be thoroughly reformed, but this does not mean that law is not needed. Xu Guangping advocated that education should concentrate its efforts on solving the illiteracy problem of more than 80% of the people in the country. Shi Fuliang believed that the law school should be renamed the Academy of Social Sciences, and the sociology department could be abolished; before graduation, students should have a period of internship, and professors should participate in some practical work in the future. Deng Chumin believed that education must completely obey politics. He believed that the slogan of professor-led governance is outdated and that students should be encouraged to participate in school governance. Immediately, Mao Dun stood up and said: The North China People's Government has stipulated that student representatives should participate in the school affairs committee of middle schools, which has already solved this problem. Chen Qiyuan immediately stood up and said in a firm tone: "Students must participate in the decision-making of school affairs. We do not advocate professor-led governance, but neither do we advocate student-led governance, but rather joint governance." At the same time, he believed that those who study natural sciences must also study politics. Zhou Jianren agreed with this view and advocated that students should study Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought. Finally, Comrade Qian Junrui proposed that the next discussion should continue under the general policy of New Democratic education, continue to discuss university curriculum issues, and the Cultural Management Committee should prepare the necessary reference materials and issue them to everyone in advance for reference. All attendees agreed.
