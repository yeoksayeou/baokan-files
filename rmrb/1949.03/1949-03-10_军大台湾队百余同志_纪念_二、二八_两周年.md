　　Military University Taiwan Team Over a Hundred Comrades
  　Commemorate the Second Anniversary of "February 28th"
    [Military University News] On February 28th, over a hundred comrades from the Taiwan Team of the North China Military and Political University held a meeting to commemorate the second anniversary of the "February 28th Incident." The meeting began with the singing of the "Taiwan Youth Song." First, Political Commissar Lin led all comrades in a meeting ceremony, then emphasized that the Taiwanese people have a glorious revolutionary tradition. This tradition must be summarized, promoted, and elevated using Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought combined with Chinese revolutionary practice, as the direction for future efforts. He also called on everyone to commemorate "February 28th," diligently study Mao Zedong Thought, and improve Marxist theory, in order to strive for the early victory of the Taiwanese people. Comrade Geng Xin, who participated in the "February 28th" revolutionary struggle, also pointed out that the "February 28th" revolution has four meanings: (1) The great struggle of the Taiwanese people against the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang is a part of the Chinese revolution. Its greatness is reflected in its large scale – island-wide; rapid development – occupying most of the island within eight days, fully demonstrating the greatness of the people's power. (2) It directly coordinated with the People's Liberation War and played a certain role, combining the Taiwanese people's liberation struggle with the Chinese People's Liberation War, striking the enemy from the rear. (3) It educated and trained the Taiwanese people to understand armed struggle and produced the people's armed forces, which are an important force for liberating the Taiwanese people. (4) It provided the Taiwanese people with many experiences and lessons – revolutionary struggle cannot be victorious without the strong leadership of the Party and correct policies and tactics; especially being blinded by victory, and not being vigilant enough against the enemy's conspiracies and deceptions, suffering an unprecedented massacre, which is a painful lesson. Finally, he emphasized: "Today, with the unprecedented victory of the Chinese People's Liberation War, the liberation of the Taiwanese people will also come soon. American imperialism and the remaining reactionary forces of the Kuomintang want to use Taiwan as the last base of counter-revolution. Therefore, the task of the Taiwanese people's struggle is even more arduous. They must study harder under the leadership of the Party, bravely shoulder the task of struggle, and destroy the conspiracy of the reactionaries." Finally, Comrade Zhou Ming, who came to the school from the south to study, spoke about his personal experience in leading armed forces to participate in the "February 28th" struggle. He recalled that the struggle failed due to the lack of experience in armed struggle and policy thinking. He expressed his determination to study hard in the People's Army school today, to avenge the 30,000 Taiwanese compatriots who were massacred, and to fight for the liberation of the 6.5 million Taiwanese compatriots.
    At the end of the meeting, a unanimous resolution was passed to issue a telegram to the people of the whole country, stating: "Under the leadership of the Communist Party, we will resolutely carry the revolution through to the end, we must realize the eight peace conditions put forward by Chairman Mao, implement true democratic peace, and strive for the liberation of Taiwan and the liberation of all of China!" That evening, a meeting was held to commend model workers, commend model comrades selected for half a year of study, and perform a historical drama of the "February 28th Revolution."

　　军大台湾队百余同志
  　纪念“二、二八”两周年
    【军大讯】二月二十八日，华北军政大学台湾队百余同志，集会纪念“二、二八”两周年，会议在高唱“台湾青年歌”声中开始；首先由林政委领导全体同志举行会议仪式后，着重指出台湾人民是有光荣革命传统的，这种传统，必须用马克思列宁主义和中国革命实践相结合的毛泽东思想，来总结发扬、提高，作为今后努力的方向。并号召大家，纪念“二、二八”，努力学习毛泽东思想，提高马克思主义理论，以争取台湾人民的早日胜利。参加“二、二八”革命斗争的庚辛同志也指出：“二、二八”革命有四个意义：（一）台湾人民反抗国民党反动统治的伟大斗争，是中国革命的一部分，他的伟大表现在规模宏大——全岛性的；发展迅速——八天内占领全岛的绝大部分，充分表现人民力量的伟大。（二）直接配合了人民解放战争并起了一定作用，他把台湾人民解放斗争和中国人民解放战争结合起来，从敌人后方打击了敌人。（三）教育和锻炼台湾人民懂得了武装斗争，并产生了人民的武装，这支武装是解放台湾人民一个重要的力量。（四）使台湾人民得到了许多经验教训——革命斗争没有坚强的党的领导和正确的政策和策略是不可能胜利的；尤其是被胜利冲昏头脑，对敌人的阴谋欺骗警惕不够，受到了空前的大屠杀，这是惨痛的教训。最后他强调说：“在中国人民解放战争空前胜利的今天，台湾人民的解放，也随着很快就要到来。美帝国主义和国民党反动残余力量要把台湾做为反革命的最后根据地，因此，台湾人民的斗争任务就更加艰巨了，必须在党的领导下，加倍努力学习，把斗争任务勇敢担负起来，摧毁反动派的这一阴谋。”最后由从南方来校学习的周明同志，谈他亲身带领武装参加“二、二八”斗争的经过。他回忆当时由于缺乏武装斗争的经验和政策思想，以致斗争失败；表示了今天在人民军队学校里学习，有决心一定学好，为被屠杀的三万台胞复仇，为六百五十万台胞解放而奋斗。
    会议最后，全体一致决议向全国人民发表“在共产党的领导下，坚决把革命进行到底，必须实现毛主席提出来的八项和平条件，实行真正的民主的和平，为解放台湾、解放全中国而奋斗”的通电。是晚，开立功表模大会，表扬这次选出半年学习的模范同志，并演出“二、二八革命”历史剧。
