　　Seeking Employment Editor:
　　I am nineteen years old this year, and I was a student at the Beiping Municipal First Girls' High School. I learned Chinese typing skills. After graduation, I became unemployed. My family life is now very difficult, and I have no job, which is extremely difficult. I sincerely hope that you, sir, can find me a job. I would be very grateful.
　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　阮耀兰

　　Editor:
　　I am an electric welding technician. Because there are many people in my family and making a living is a problem, I went to the factory to sign up, but the factory is not operating. Please, editor, point out a way out!
　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　Worker Zhuang Changfa

　　To Ruan Yaolan and Zhuang Changfa: We sympathize with you for being unemployed. The Social Affairs Section of the Municipal Civil Affairs Bureau is currently conducting unemployment registration. You can register there, and they may be able to introduce you to a job. The Municipal Civil Affairs Bureau is currently located on Fuyou Street. You can go there to find it.

　　Furthermore: Since Mr. Ruan has already studied at the high school level and has typing skills, he can also apply to the Old Revolutionary University. After graduation, he can also obtain suitable work.

　　代寻职业编辑先生：
    我今年十九岁，原在北平市立第一女子中学高中肄业，曾学过打华字技术，毕业后，就失了业，现在家庭生活很困难，又没有职业，异常为难，谨望先生，代为找下职业，我是非常感谢。
    　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　阮耀兰编辑先生：
    我是一个电焊技术工人，因家中人多生活成问题，到工厂去报名，工厂不开工，请编辑先生指一条出路！
    　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　工人庄长发
    阮耀兰、庄长发二君：你们没有职业，我们十分同情。现在市政府民政局社会科正在进行失业登记，你可去那里登记一下，他们是可能给你介绍到职业的。市政府民政局现住府右街，你可去那里找。
    再者：阮君既已在高中肄业，又有打字技术，还可去投老革命大学，毕业后，也可获得适当工作的。
