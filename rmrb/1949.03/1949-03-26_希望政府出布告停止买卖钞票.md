　　Hope the Government Issues a Notice to Stop Buying and Selling Banknotes
    Recently in Beijing, there are many people who, day and night, shout on the streets about buying Northeast Great Wall currency. Yesterday afternoon at five o'clock, I went for a walk and encountered six people. Most of them are city dwellers. According to citizen Yang Mengjie, about five hundred people are buying and selling in sacks under Qianmen Wupailou every day. Small vendors buy from citizens at 11 yuan of People's Bank Notes for 10,000 yuan of Great Wall currency, and then sell it to large vendors, making 2 yuan of People's Bank Notes for every 100,000 yuan. I feel that this is not good for stabilizing the market and prices. Therefore, I suggest that the government should issue a notice to stop buying and selling banknotes. Those who have Northeast currency can go to the bank to exchange it.

　　希望政府出布告停止买卖钞票
    近来在北平市有很多人，不分昼夜，在大街上高喊收买东北长城币。昨天下午五时我到街上散步，一次就碰着六人。大都是城里人，据市民杨梦杰谈：前门五牌楼下每天有五百来人成麻袋的买卖。小贩买市民的是按十一元人民券买长城币一万元，再卖给大贩时，每十万元赚人民券二元。我感觉这对稳定市场和物价不好。因此我建议政府应下布告，停止买卖钞票。存东北币者，可到银行去兑换。
