Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, 1st - Since the opening of the Pinghan Railway from Yancheng to Laotian'an, there have been two incidents in February, but both were safely resolved thanks to the heroic, resourceful, and dedicated employees. The first incident occurred at 10:00 AM on February 11th, when the No. 82 passenger train from Longping Railway heading north was passing the Yellow River Bridge. As the third carriage reached the 43rd bridge, a bale of hemp suddenly fell from the train, landing directly on the tracks. As the first wheel ran over it, the train body experienced violent shaking. Bridge workers Zhao Fulin and Qin, disregarding their own safety, urgently pulled the bale of hemp away, allowing the train to pass safely. The second incident occurred on the evening of February 20th, when the No. 1579 southbound train arrived at the railway bridge south of Xuchang. This bridge had been hastily constructed last winter and was not strong enough. Recently, due to the thawing of silt at the bottom of the river, the sleeper piers under the bridge gradually subsided. When the train reached the bridge, the bridge body lowered with the sleeper piers under the heavy pressure of the locomotive. The pilot touched the track, and the locomotive experienced a major jolt. The driver of the train, Wang Deyi, acted with resourcefulness and quickly opened the valve to pull the locomotive out of the bridge first, then immediately applied the brakes and stopped the train. All passengers disembarked, allowing the empty train to safely clear the bridge before re-boarding. The bridge workers, drivers, and others are currently being recommended by their respective departments for commendation by the Longping Railway Administration.

　　平汉路员工英勇机智
  　两次抢救遇险列车脱险
    【新华社郑州一日电】平汉铁路自郾城至老田庵段通车以来，在二月份中曾遇险两次，但均在英勇机智、忠于职守的员工们抢救之下，安然脱险。第一次是二月十一日上午十时，陇平铁路北上八十二次客车行经黄河大桥，第三辆客车驶至四十三号桥上时车上突然掉下麻袋一捆，正落在轨道上。当第一个车轮轧过时，车身即发生激烈簸动。桥工赵福林、秦＠为了行车及乘客的安全，不顾性命，急将麻袋捆抢出，列车乃得安全通过。第二次是在二月二十日晚，当一五七九次南行列车开抵许昌南之铁轨铁桥，该桥系在去冬中仓促架成，不够坚固，近又因河底淤泥解冻，桥底枕木墩逐渐下沉，待列车开抵该桥时，桥身受机车重大压力乃随枕木墩下降，排障器触及轨道，机车大受震荡，该车司机王德有情极智生，急开气门把机车先抢出桥头，赶忙上闸停车，乘客全部下车，使空列车安然脱险而后登车。现该桥工司机等正由各该部门分请陇平铁路管理局嘉奖中。
