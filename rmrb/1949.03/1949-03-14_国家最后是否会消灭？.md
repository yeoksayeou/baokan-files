Inquiry and Reply

To the Editor:

We encountered two questions while studying A Brief History of Social Development:

　　One, some comrades believe that freemen were exploiters, while others believe they were the exploited. Which type were they actually? Two, in the discussion on the relationship between the state and class, some comrades believe that the state is a tool for ruling the people and that the state will be abolished in future communist society. Some comrades believe that the state itself is not a tool of rule; rather, it depends on who holds state power. If it is held by the rulers and exploiters, the state is a tool of rule, used to rule and exploit the people. If it is held by the people, it is the people’s organizational system and institution. Which of these two statements is correct? Please provide a detailed answer!

Comrade Dong Xu:

Regarding the questions you raised, here are brief answers respectively:

　　One, freemen were a product of the slave era. At that time, due to wars between tribes, the victorious tribes took the captives as slaves and made them participate in production. In this way, society began to split into the exploiters and the exploited, i.e., the master and the slave classes. "Freemen" were members of these victorious tribes. Like the slave owners, they were parasites who lived off the labor of slaves, and as a result, they inevitably tended to corruption and decline.

　　Two, the state is a product of social development to the point where private property systems arose and class society was established. It is a tool for one class to oppress another.

　　In the course of historical development, the state has always been in the hands of the class that owns the major means of production. There have been states of slave owners, states of feudal lords, and states of the bourgeoisie (these states have forms such as monarchical autocracy, constitutional monarchy, republic, and fascism), states of joint dictatorship of the revolutionary classes led by the proletariat (i.e., the New Democratic state), and states of the dictatorship of the proletariat (i.e., the Soviet Union).

　　In the above forms of the state, although the state is a tool of class oppression in all cases, there is an essential difference between the first three and the last two. That is, the power of the first three is in the hands of a few exploiting classes, who use this organization to oppress and exploit the broad masses of people and use it as a tool to rule the people; the fourth is the revolutionary people's democratic dictatorship, which uses it to suppress the activities of counter-revolutionaries in order to build a New Democratic society and transition to socialism in the future; and the last is used to suppress and eliminate the exploiting classes in order to build socialism, to achieve the final elimination of classes, the realization of communism, and the final elimination of the state as a tool of rule. Therefore, the state as a tool is to be abolished.

### 国家最后是否会消灭？

专栏：询问与答复

　　国家最后是否会消灭？编辑同志：
    我们在学习社会发展简史里遇到两个问题：
    一、自由民，有的同志认为是剥削者，有的同志认为是被剥削者。到底属于哪种人？二、在讨论国家与阶级的关系一题中，有的同志认为国家是统治人民的一种工具，到将来的共产主义社会里，即要取消国家。有的同志认为国家本身不是统治工具，而是看国家政权掌握在谁手里的，掌握在统治者与剥削者手里，国家即是统治工具，用来统治与剥削人民；而掌握在人民手里，即是人民的组织系统与机构。此两种说法究竟哪个正确？请详细答复！
    　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　榆次北车站　东旭东旭同志：
    关于你所提的问题，兹分别简答如下：
    一、自由民是奴隶时代的产物，当时由于各部落的战争，胜利的部落，便将所得的俘虏作为奴隶，使其参加生产。这样，社会便开始分裂为榨取者与被榨取者，即主人与奴隶二阶级。“自由民”是这些胜利部落中的成员，他们是与奴隶主同样依赖于奴隶的劳动而生活着的寄生者，结果便不得不趋于腐败没落。
    二、国家是社会发展到私有财产制度产生、阶级社会确立的产物。它是一个阶级压迫别一个阶级的工具。
    在历史的发展过程中，国家都是掌握在拥有主要生产手段的阶级的手里，它有着奴隶主的国家，封建主的国家，资产阶级的国家（这几种国家中有君主专制、君主立宪、共和制、法西斯等形式），无产阶级领导的、各革命阶级联合专政的国家（即新民主主义的国家），以及无产阶级专政的国家（即苏联）。
    在以上诸种形态的国家中，虽然国家都是阶级压迫的工具，但前三者与后二者却有着本质的区别。即前三者的政权是掌握在少数剥削阶级的手里，他们都是利用此一组织，进行对广大人民的压迫与剥削，用它来作为统治人民的工具；第四种是革命的人民民主专政，用它来镇压反革命份子的活动，以建设新民主主义社会，在将来过渡到社会主义；最后一种是用以镇压、消灭剥削阶级，以建设社会主义，以达到最后消灭阶级，实现共产主义，最后消灭国家这制统治工具。所以国家这工具是要被取消的。
