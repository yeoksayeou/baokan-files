Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 16th. The Agricultural Department of the Northeast Administrative Committee convened a conference of directors of agricultural experiment farms late last month. Twenty-six people attended, including directors and technicians from farms directly under the department and provincial farms. At the meeting, Zhang Kewei, director of the Agricultural Production Department of the Agricultural Department, first reported on the guidelines and tasks for establishing agricultural experiment farms at all levels. He emphasized that the experimental work of agricultural experiment farms should focus on research and experimentation on things that have a significant impact on improving agricultural production and can be universally achieved, based on the needs of improving agricultural production and the currently available technical conditions, to achieve gradual popularization and improvement. The business policy of the experiment farms is to focus on crops, and each region focuses on several major crops that are suitable for local conditions. For example, Liaoning Province has 1.5 million apple trees, and the Xiong Yue Agricultural Experiment Farm in the province focuses on cultivating fruit tree varieties and overcoming apple rot. Keshan in Heilongjiang is rich in wheat, and the local agricultural experiment farm focuses on wheat as the experimental focus, and plans to test various farm tools pulled by horses in the Heihe area, and promote the excellent ones. The Ministry of Agriculture has decided to establish two central experiment farms in southern and northern Manchuria respectively, one central experiment farm in each province, and seed collection farms or seed breeding farms combined with production in larger counties. The experiment farms of the Ministry of Agriculture, provinces, and counties should also have a division of labor and different work focuses. Wei Zhenwu, Minister of Agriculture, specifically stated in his summary that the main tasks of the farms directly under the Ministry of Agriculture are seed selection, breeding, disease prevention and control, new agricultural machinery testing, and livestock breed improvement testing. Provincial experiment farms should focus on testing regional varieties and preventing and controlling diseases. Counties should establish variety breeding farms or seed collection farms, mainly to breed existing excellent varieties and use existing technical experience for demonstration and promotion. According to the above guidelines and tasks, the directors of each farm checked their work plans at the meeting and found that the plans of some experiment farms were practical. For example, the Jiamusi Agricultural Experiment Farm was preparing to collect ploughs created by local farmers for testing and promote the good ones; the experiment farms in Andong and Tonghua in Andong Province had already begun investigating the farming habits of farmers in various places last year. The Xiong Yue Experiment Farm produced some medicines for preventing apple diseases last year and sold them to farmers at low prices. However, the plans of some experiment farms were more or less divorced from reality. For example, the Heilongjiang Experiment Farm planned to experiment with cotton planting in the province, abandoning the flax cultivation experiment suitable for the province; the Xiong Yue Experiment Farm divorced from reality and prepared to conduct various soil analyses and other chemical experiments. There are also some experiment farms with too many plans and no clear focus.
The Northeast Daily, in an editorial entitled "Take a Step Forward in Improving Agricultural Production Technology," emphasized that improving agricultural production technology has become an important issue in developing rural productive forces. Improving agricultural production must be combined with the masses of farmers. Agricultural experiment farms must conduct experimental research with emphasis under a unified policy and a unified plan, distinguishing regions and the nature of experiment farms. The practice of trying to create a botanical garden with all kinds of plants is not practical. Regarding the two issues of promotion and improvement, the editorial pointed out: Promotion must be to promote to the masses, and improvement must also be from the masses. Regardless of promotion and improvement, we must be good at absorbing and summarizing the production experience of the farmers and the masses, and should improve from the existing technical level of the farmers, and then promote it to the masses of farmers.

### 东北各农场场长会议　研究逐步提高农作技术

　　东北各农场场长会议
  　研究逐步提高农作技术
    【新华社沈阳十六日电】东北行政委员会农业部曾于上月下旬召开农事试验场场长会议，到会者有该部直属农场及各省立农场场长和技术人员共二十六名。会上，首由农业部农产处处长张克威报告建立各级农事试验场的方针与任务，他着重说明，农事试验场的试验工作，应根据提高农业生产的需要与目前可能利用的技术条件，抓紧对提高农业生产作用大的、而且可以普遍作得到的事情，进行研究试验，求得逐渐的普及与提高。试验场的业务方针，是以农作物为主，每个地区又以适合于当地条件的几种主要农作物为主。如辽宁省有苹果树一百五十万棵，该省熊岳农事试验场即以培养果树品种及克服苹果腐烂病为研究的重点之一。黑龙江克山盛产小麦，该处农事试验场即以小麦为试验重点，并计划将黑河一带马拉的各种农具加以试验，对其优良者加以推广。农业部决定在南满和北满分别建立两个中心试验场，每省建立一个中心试验场，较大的县份建立与生产相结合的采种场或种籽繁殖场。农业部的、省的，县的试验场也应有分工，有不同工作的重点。农业部部长魏震五在总结中具体的说明农业部直属各场的主要工作是选种、育种、防治病害、新式农具试验、改良家畜品种试验等。各省立试验场应偏重试验地域性的品种、防除病害等。县设品种繁殖场或采种场，主要是繁殖已有的优良品种及使用已有的技术经验，作示范和推广工作。根据上述方针任务，各场场长分别在会上检查了自己的工作计划，发现部份试验场的计划是切合实际的，如佳木斯农事试验场准备收集当地农民创造的犁杖，进行试验，把好的加以推广；安东省安东、通化等地试验场去年即已开始调查各地农民的耕种习惯。熊岳试验场于去年制出部分预防苹果病害的药剂，贱价售与农民。但是，部份试验场的计划中，或多或少有脱离实际的偏向。如黑龙江试验场计划在该省试验殖棉，而放弃了适宜该省的亚麻培植试验；熊岳试验场脱离现实地准备进行各种土壤分析及其他化学试验等。还有一些试验场存在着计划繁多，中心不明的偏向。
    东北日报在题为“把农业生产技术提高一步”的社论中着重地指出：改进农业生产技术，已成为发展农村生产力的一个重要问题。而提高农业生产必须与农民群众结合。农事试验场必须在统一的方针、统一的计划之下，分别地区，分别试验场性质，有重点地进行试验研究。企图百卉俱全造成植物大观园的作法，是不切合实际的。关于推广与提高两个问题，社论指出：推广必须是向群众推广，提高也必须是从群众提高。无论推广与提高，必须善于吸收并总结农民民众的生产经验，应从农民的现有的技术水平基础之上去提高，然后把它再向农民群众推广。
