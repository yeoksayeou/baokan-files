　　Anniversary of Clearing Out the Traitorous Reactionaries
  　Czechoslovakia Commemorates the February Events
    Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, February 28th: TASS, Prague - The Central Committee of the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia convened a meeting in Prague on February 24th to commemorate the first anniversary of the February 1948 events. Rudolf Slánský, General Secretary of the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia, pointed out in his report that the great significance of the February events lies in the fact that it definitively and irreversibly determined Czechoslovakia's development towards socialism. Slánský emphasized that without the Communist Party, this victory of the Czechoslovak people and the establishment of the new Czechoslovak People's Democratic Republic would have been impossible.
    In recent days, Prague newspapers have devoted considerable space to commemorating the February 1948 events. The newspapers all published a letter from the Presidium of the Central Action Committee of the National Front to the President of the Czechoslovak Republic, Klement Gottwald. The first anniversary of the February events coincides with the 20th anniversary of Gottwald's leadership of the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia. An exhibition commemorating last year's victory over the Czechoslovak reactionaries and Gottwald's revolutionary activities opened in Prague on February 19th.
    Note: Last year, on February 20th, the remaining reactionary forces in Czechoslovakia, with the support of American and British imperialism, attempted to seize power and restore the bourgeoisie by creating a government crisis through the resignation of twelve right-wing ministers in the cabinet, in order to prevent the people from moving towards socialism. However, under the counterattack of the workers and peasants led by the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia, the government crisis was overcome within five days, and Gottwald formed a new government. The government, the National Assembly, and the National Front were consolidated by purging the reactionaries.

　　清除叛国反动派一周年
  　捷克纪念二月事件
    【新华社陕北二十八日电】塔斯社布拉格讯：捷克斯洛伐克共产党中央委员会，二月二十四日在布拉格召集一九四八年二月事件一周年纪念会。捷共总书记斯兰斯基在其报告中指出，二月事件的伟大意义，在于它最后无可变更地决定了捷克斯洛伐克向社会主义的方向发展。斯兰斯基强调称：要是没有共产党，捷克斯洛伐克人民的这个胜利与新的捷克斯洛伐克人民民主共和国的建立，就会成为不可能。
    布拉格各报日来均已相当大的篇幅纪念一九四八年的二月事件。各报均刊登民族阵线中央行动委员会主席团给捷克斯洛伐克共和国总统哥特瓦尔德的信。二月事件一周年纪念，适逢哥特瓦尔德领导捷克斯洛伐克共产党二十周年纪念，纪念去年二月战胜捷克斯洛伐克反动派的胜利与哥特瓦尔德革命活动的展览会，于二月十九日在布拉格开幕。
    按：去年二月二十日，捷克斯洛伐克残余的反动势力，在美英帝国主义的支持之下，曾以内阁中十二个右翼部长的辞职，造成政府危机，企图夺取政权，使资产阶级复辟，阻止人民走向社会主义，但在为捷共所领导的工农群众的反击下，政府危机在五天之内克服了，哥特瓦尔德并组成了新政府。政府、国民议会与民族阵线因为清洗了反动派而巩固起来。
