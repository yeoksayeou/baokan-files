　　Over Two Thousand Villages in Central Hebei Newly Liberated
    Peasants Eagerly Demand Land to Resume Production
    Currently the First Priority Should Be to Eliminate Bandit and Puppet Remnants and Establish Revolutionary Rule
    [This Newspaper's Report] After the Pingjin Campaign, approximately two thousand villages in the Central Hebei region were newly liberated. The local people urgently demand land and the resumption of production. The population of the new areas, according to current known estimates, is 1.6 million to 1.9 million, accounting for about one-fifth of the total population of the Central Hebei region (the number of villages also accounts for about one-fifth of the total). Currently, the enemy's overt armed forces have been annihilated, and social order is gradually stabilizing. However, feudal reactionary forces still lurk with a certain amount of strength in the villages. Some reactionary landlords and rich peasants still control political power, oppressing the people, and the old puppet regime has not yet been destroyed. Due to the long-term rule of the reactionary Kuomintang government in the area, there are many secret agents, bandits, scattered soldiers, and roving bandits. There are also a significant number of Kuomintang members and Three People's Principles Youth League members. Most of the personnel in these organizations and scattered soldiers and roving bandits have not yet registered, and some unawakened bad elements are still continuing their activities, posing a certain degree of threat to the people. Due to the Kuomintang bandit army's forced conscription, there are quite a few pseudo-affiliates in some places (such as Xincheng).
    The suffering of the peasants during the Kuomintang rule was great: land was completely concentrated in the hands of a few large landlords, and there are still landlords who own dozens, hundreds, or even thousands of hectares of land, and they possess arms. The landless poor peasants and farm laborers in these areas account for as much as 60 to 80 percent of the total population. Landlords and rich peasants who own large amounts of land, however, only account for 4 to 5 percent of the population. A portion of the newly liberated areas are regions that had previously established democratic regimes, and the peasants had participated in struggles such as rent reduction, interest reduction, liquidation of grievances, and land reform. With the support of the democratic government, they obtained land from the landlords. However, after the reactionary Kuomintang government forcibly took control, some reactionary landlords carried out reversals of these gains, and land changes were very drastic. Some cultivated the land themselves after reversing the gains, while others re-rented, pawned, or transferred it. Judging from the current situation, land is dispersed, but because the reactionary Kuomintang government adopted a method of apportioning taxes based on acreage, some land is left uncultivated because no one dares to cultivate it. Landlords and rich peasants conceal their land holdings to a serious extent. In addition, the reactionary government's "care" for them through the "first the poor, then the rich" method (that is, first let the poor bear the burden, and then it is the rich's turn), resulted in "the poor becoming poorer and the rich becoming richer," and the miserable situation of the poor peasants can be imagined.
    Under the combined oppression of the reactionary Kuomintang rule and the reactionary landlords, the peasants have a deep hatred for the enemy. After our democratic government entered the area, the peasants automatically demanded the liquidation of grievances, the elimination of scattered soldiers and roving bandits, and the destruction of the landlords' regime that oppressed the peasants, replacing it with a people's democratic regime. They demanded the resolution of land issues, the resolution of means of production and means of livelihood. However, at the same time, there were also some concerns: concerns about secret agents and landlord elements committing sabotage and assassinations.
    The Central Hebei District Party Committee has now, based on this situation, set out a policy, believing that before the remnant forces of the enemy and puppets are thoroughly eliminated, before the landlords and rich peasants have bowed their heads to the peasants, and before the peasants have obtained certain means of production and means of livelihood, even the conditions for peasants to urgently carry out production to solve their livelihood difficulties are not easy to achieve. Currently, the most important thing is to rely on the masses, initially mobilize the masses, destroy enemy and puppet organizations, establish revolutionary organizations, eliminate production obstacles as much as possible, stabilize the peasants' production mood, and specifically organize and solve production difficulties, ensure sowing, and prevent land from being left uncultivated.

　　冀中两千余村庄农民新获解放
    迫切要求土地恢复生产
    当前首应肃清匪伪残余树立革命统治
    【本报讯】平津战役结束后，在冀中区约有二千余个村庄新获解放，当地人民迫切要求土地、恢复生产。新区人口数目，目前已知悉的概略统计为一百六十万至一百九十万，约占冀中区总人口数的五分之一（村庄数目亦占总数五分之一左右），目前敌人之公开武装力量已被歼灭，社会秩序亦渐趋稳定，但村中封建反动势力仍潜伏一定力量，有些反动的地主、富农仍操持政权，压迫人民，旧的伪政权仍未摧毁。由于反动的国民党政府对该地的长期统治，特务土匪、散兵、游匪很多，国民党员、三青团员在数量上也不少，这些组织及散兵游匪等分子，其中多数人员至今仍未登记，部分不觉悟的坏分子，仍在继续活动，对人民有一定程度的威胁作用。由于国民党匪军强拉壮丁，有些地方（如新城）伪属相当多。
    农民在国民党统治期间所受的痛苦是很大的：土地完全集中在一些大地主的手中，现尚有拥有土地几十顷、几百顷、甚至千顷以上的地主，且拥有武装。失掉土地的贫农、雇农在这类地区竟达总人口百分之六十至八十。而拥有大量土地的地主与富农却只占人口的百分之四至百分之五。新解放的地区中有一部是曾经建立过民主政权的地区，农民曾经参加过减租、减息、清算复仇与土地改革等斗争。在民主政府的支持下，从地主手中取得了土地。但自为国民党反动政府强行统治后，某些反动地主进行了倒算，土地变动十分剧烈。有的倒算后自种，有的倒算后转租转当或转让人。土地就目前的情况看，是分散的，但由于国民党反动政府采取按亩摊差的办法，有些土地，任其荒芜也无人敢耕种。地主富农瞒地的情况很严重，加以反动政府对他们在“先穷后富”的办法（即先让穷人负担以后才轮富人负担）上的“照顾”，因此“穷人更穷，富人更富”，贫苦农民的悲惨状况是可以想见的。
    在国民党反动统治与反动地主结合压榨下，农民对敌人的仇恨是很深的，当我民主政府进入该地后，农民自动要求清算复仇，要求肃清散兵游匪，要求摧毁地主压榨农民的政权而代之以人民民主政权，要求解决土地问题，解决生产资料与生活资料；但同时却又存在着一些顾虑：顾虑特务和地主等作恶分子暗害暗杀。
    冀中区党委现已依据这一情况，定出方针，认为在敌伪残余势力未彻底肃清，地主、富农尚未向农民低头，农民尚未取得一定的生产资料与生活资料之前，连农民急需进行生产以解决生活困难的条件，都不易进行。目前最主要的应该是依靠群众，初步发动群众，摧毁敌伪组织，树立革命组织，尽可能扫除生产障碍，稳定农民生产情绪，并具体组织与解决生产上的困难，保证下种，不荒土地。
