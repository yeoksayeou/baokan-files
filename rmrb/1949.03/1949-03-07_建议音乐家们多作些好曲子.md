Criticism and Suggestions

To the Editor:

During the New Year and the celebrations for the liberation of Peiping and Tientsin, some schools only performed dances without singing, or they were outdated old tunes. The masses love to listen to and watch new operas, but most teachers can't write or write them well, and there are very few rural artists. Under these circumstances, the masses have to listen to them reluctantly. Therefore, I suggest that our artists create more marches, dance music, and general music theory and composition methods and publish them in newspapers. This will help to develop rural cultural and entertainment activities. However, the songs in the newspapers before were mostly Shanxi tunes, which are not accustomed to singing in the Jinnan area. Therefore, I hope that songs can be composed according to the customs of the masses in various places.

### 建议音乐家们多作些好曲子

专栏：批评与建议

　　建议音乐家们多作些好曲子编辑同志：
    今年年关及庆祝平津解放开展文化娱乐的时候，有部份的学校跳舞，只是不带唱的单纯表演，即或有也是早已过时的老调。群众是爱听爱看新歌剧的，但一般的教员，编不了或编不好，农村艺人又很少，在此情况下，群众只得勉强地听着。因此我建议咱们的艺术家们多创作一些进行曲、舞谱以及一般乐理、作曲法等登在报上，这对开展农村文化娱乐运动是有帮助的。但以前报纸上的歌子多是山西调，在冀南区里唱起来不习惯，因此更希望能够根据各地群众的习俗作一些歌曲才好。
