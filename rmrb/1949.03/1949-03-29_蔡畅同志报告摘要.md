Summary of Comrade Cai Chang's report on "The Current Situation and Tasks of the World Democratic Women's Movement":

    She first described the emergence and tasks of the core of the World Democratic Women's Unity—the Women's International Democratic Federation (WIDF). She said: The tasks of the WIDF are very clear: "(1) To completely eliminate Fascism, eradicate Fascist ideas, support close cooperation among all countries in the world in political, economic, and cultural aspects, establish lasting and solid peace, and prevent the recurrence of aggressive wars; (2) To organize women in all countries of the world to defend their political, economic, legal, and social rights in order to achieve social progress; (3) To protect the health of children and the normal physical development of young people; (4) To strengthen the friendship and unity of women all over the world."

    Next, she briefly introduced the current situation of this most authoritative international democratic women's organization, composed of fifty-six member countries and possessing more than eighty million organized women. She said: It is closely linked to the World Federation of Trade Unions and the World Federation of Democratic Youth, and is a main force in the world democratic movement. The Women's Federation of the Chinese Liberated Areas joined the WIDF at the end of 1945 and is one of its strong members.

    The report especially cited many vivid examples to illustrate the different lives and struggles of women in the four types of countries in the world.

    She said: Women in the socialist Soviet Union have truly achieved equality in all aspects of politics, economy, and culture. In the work of managing the country, 480,000 women have been elected to local Soviets (women account for one-third of the total number of 2,000 representatives to the Supreme Soviets of the federal and autonomous republics), and 277 women are representatives to the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union, which is more than all the female parliamentarians in the world combined. Women participate particularly widely in the management of industry and agriculture. In industry, transportation, and construction alone, there are 280,000 female engineers, factory directors, and technicians, 350,000 female team leaders in collective farms, and 15,000 female farm chairpersons. This March, the resolution of the Central Committee of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) proposed to further call on various leading organs to promote women to leading positions. The efforts of Soviet women should be an example for women in all countries. At this point, Comrade Cai Chang called on all representatives at the conference to learn from Soviet women, which was immediately met with enthusiastic applause from the audience.

    Next, she spoke about the women of the New Democratic countries. She said that the new constitutions of these countries stipulate equal rights for women. Moreover, the people are working hard to implement these provisions. For example, Romania already has thirty-three women elected as members of parliament and thirty women as mayors. The women of these countries are now participating fully in the construction of the country and striving to complete the country's economic plan.

    Speaking of women in capitalist countries, Comrade Cai Chang pointed out that they do not enjoy equality with men. For example, in the 1949 British Parliament, there were only seven women among nearly seven hundred members, less than two percent. But she pointed out that the broad masses of women in capitalist countries have united around the Women's International Democratic Federation, readily responding to its call, holding marches and demonstrations, opposing aggression, opposing war, and opposing the reactionary measures of their own governments.

    When talking about the tragic situation of women and children in colonial and semi-colonial countries and the vigorous development of national liberation revolutionary struggles in these countries, she pointed out: Our China is approaching nationwide victory and is a shining example in the liberation struggle.

    Comrade Cai Chang spoke about the position of the Chinese women's movement in the world women's movement. She said that the Chinese revolution will soon achieve nationwide victory, which means a decisive blow to US imperialism and the demise of the Kuomintang reactionary rule supported by US imperialism. In Asia, a New Democratic country with nearly 500 million people will emerge, which will have a profound impact on the world, especially on Asian countries! Our victory provides a clear example for the people enslaved by US imperialism in the world. Thirty-two years after the victory of the socialist revolution in the Soviet Union, the road of China's liberation is the road to liberation for all colonial and semi-colonial countries. She then went on to say that China is a large country in Asia, and the All-China Democratic Women's Federation is a strong member of the Women's International Democratic Federation. Delegates from various countries at the Second Congress of the WIDF warmly hoped that the Asian Women's Conference would be held in the liberated areas of China, and China is primarily responsible for the Asian Conference Preparatory Committee. Therefore, strengthening the ties between Asian women and pushing the Asian women's movement forward to increase the strength of the Women's International Democratic Federation in Asia is our unshirkable responsibility.

    Finally, she encouraged everyone: We should gloriously shoulder this responsibility and strive to complete the task. We must combine this with the Chinese revolutionary struggle, strengthen our ties with the world democratic and peace movement, warmly respond to the World Peace Congress to be held in Paris, and stand together with democratic women around the world to support women in all countries in defending peace and opposing the instigators of new wars.

　　蔡畅同志报告摘要
    蔡畅同志在妇代大会上关于“世界民主妇女运动的现状及其任务”报告摘要：
    她首先叙说了世界民主妇女团结的核心——国际民主妇联的产生及其任务。她说：国际妇女的任务很明确：“（一）彻底消灭法西斯主义，根绝法西斯观念，拥护世界各国在政治、经济、文化各方面的密切合作，建立持久与巩固的和平，阻止侵略战争再度爆发；（二）组织世界各国妇女，保卫她们政治、经济、法律和社会的权利，以实现社会的进步；（三）保护儿童的健康及青年生理上的正常发展；（四）加强全世界妇女的友谊和团结。”
    接着，她简单地介绍了这个五十六个会员国组成，而拥有八千万以上有组织妇女的最有权威的国际民主妇女团体的现状。并说：它和世界职工联盟，世界民主青联紧密的联系着，同为世界民主运动中的主力军。中国解放区妇联是一九四五年底加入国际妇联的，为其强大的会员之一。
    报告中特别引用了很多生动的例子，来说明世界四种类型国家里妇女不同的生活和斗争。
    她说：在社会主义苏联的妇女，才真正得到了政治、经济、文化各方面的平等。在管理国家的工作中，有四十八万妇女被选入地方苏维埃（二千联邦和自治共和国最高苏维埃代表中，妇女占总数三分之一），二百七十七名妇女为苏联最高苏维埃代表，这比全世界所有女议员还多。在管理工业农业的工作中，妇女尤其普遍参加，单就工业、运输业、建筑业中的女工程师、女厂长、女技师，就有二十八万人，集体农庄中有三十五万女耕种队长，一万五千女农庄主席。今年三月联共中央决议提出，要更进一步号召各种领导机关，把妇女提升到领导职位上来。苏联妇女的努力，应当是各国妇女的榜样。至此，蔡畅同志号召大会全体代表，向苏联妇女学习，当即得到全场热烈鼓掌响应。
    接着，她说到新民主主义国家的妇女。她说，这些国家，新的宪法规定了妇女的平等权利。而且人民正努力实行这些规定，例如罗马尼亚已经有三十三位妇女当选为国会议员，三十位妇女当了市长。这些国家的妇女，现正以全力参加国家的建设工作，为完成国家的经济计划而奋斗。
    讲到资本主义国家的妇女，蔡畅同志指出，她们并不能与男子享受平等。例如一九四九年的英国国会，将近七百个议员里只有七个妇女，还不到百分之二。但她指出，资本主义国家的广大妇女群众，已经团结到国际民主妇联的周围来，随时响应它的号召，举行游行示威，反对侵略，反对战争，反对其本国政府的反动措施。
    在讲到殖民地半殖民地国家妇女儿童的悲惨境遇和这些国家民族解放革命斗争的蓬勃发展时，她指出：我们中国已接近于全国胜利，是解放斗争中一个光辉的例子。
    蔡畅同志讲到了中国妇运在世界妇运中的地位。她说，中国革命很快就会得到全国胜利，这就意味着美帝国主义受到决定性的打击，意味着美帝国主义支持下的国民党反动统治的灭亡。在亚洲领土上，将出现一个将近五亿人口的新民主主义国家，这将给世界，特别是亚洲各国多么严重的影响！我们的胜利给世界被美帝国主义奴役下的人民以明显的榜样。在苏联社会主义革命胜利三十二年的现在，中国解放的道路，就是一切殖民地半殖民地国家解放的道路。她接着又说，中国是亚洲的大国，中国妇联又是国际民主妇联的有力会员，国际妇联二次代表大会的各国代表，都热烈希望亚洲的妇女会议在中国解放区召开，而亚洲会议筹备会，中国是主要的负责人。因此，加强亚洲妇女的联系，把亚洲妇女运动向前推进一步，以增长国际民主妇联在亚洲的力量，我们是责无旁贷的。
    最后，她鼓励大家说：应当光荣的担起这个担子，努力完成任务。我们要结合着中国革命斗争，加强我们与世界民主、和平运动的联系，热烈响应即将在巴黎召开的世界拥护和平大会，与世界民主妇女在一起，声援各国妇女保卫和平，反对新战争的挑拨者。
