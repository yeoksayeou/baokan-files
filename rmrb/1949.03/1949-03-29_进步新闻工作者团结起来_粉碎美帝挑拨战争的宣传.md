Progressive Journalists Unite
Crush the Propaganda of American Imperialism Inciting War
(Declaration jointly issued by the Liberated Area Journalists Association and the China Youth Journalists Society)

[Our Newspaper Despatch] The China Liberated Area Journalists Association and the China Youth Journalists Society met in this city on the 24th of this month. At the meeting, they unanimously responded to the call for a World Congress for Peace and decided to send representatives to participate. They also issued a declaration, the original text of which is as follows:

The journalists of the Chinese Liberated Areas, as well as peace-loving and democratic journalists in the Kuomintang-controlled areas, warmly welcome the suggestion of the World Congress of Intellectuals in Defense of Peace and the International Democratic Women's Federation, and other organizations, to convene a World Congress for Peace in Paris in late April. We have decided to send representatives to participate along with representatives from Chinese workers, peasants, women, youth, cultural and academic circles.

Chinese journalists deeply understand that a sharp struggle is unfolding today between the international peace, democracy, and anti-imperialist camp led by the Soviet Union, and the international war, anti-democratic, and imperialist camp headed by American imperialism. In recent months, American imperialism has orchestrated the so-called North Atlantic Treaty, brewing the so-called "Pacific Group" and "Mediterranean Group," manufacturing instruments of aggression, and deploying aggressive bases, plotting to launch a new world war. This sinful war plan of American imperialism must be crushed and can be crushed.

The great leader of the Chinese people, Mao Zedong, has told us: Imperialism is just a paper tiger, and any "powerful" imperialism can be defeated. We have not only verified this truth in the Second World War but have also gained a deeper understanding of this truth from the process of the Chinese People's Revolutionary War. In the less than three years of the Liberation War, we have already used our own strength to defeat a Kuomintang counter-revolutionary military machine armed to the teeth by American imperialism. Therefore, as long as the democratic forces of the world unite under the leadership of the Soviet Union, they will surely be able to defeat any imperialist enslavement plans and war conspiracies.

The Chinese people demand lasting world peace and resolutely oppose a new world war. If American imperialism and its servants dare to launch new adventures, we will defeat them just as we defeated Japanese imperialism and the Kuomintang supported by American imperialism. The Chinese people deeply know that American imperialism is the mortal enemy of the Chinese people, while the Soviet Union has always been, is now, and will always be the great and loyal comrade-in-arms of the Chinese people. The Chinese people vow to stand firmly with the Soviet Union against our common enemy. The convening of this World Congress for Peace is very important and urgent for mobilizing the vast masses of hundreds of millions of people around the world who love peace and hate war to rise up against the American imperialist war plan. This congress has been wholeheartedly supported by all peace-loving people around the world, which makes American imperialism increasingly isolated and more and more terrified. However, it must be noted that the greater the difficulties of imperialism, the more it conspires and seeks "a way out" through adventures. Therefore, the world's peace and democratic forces must be even more vigilant in the future, consolidate their unity around the Soviet Union, the cornerstone of world peace, raise our banners even higher, and work harder in our struggle to defend peace, democracy, and national independence.

In all capitalist countries, the vast majority of journalists and news organizations are being used by warmongers as tools to incite war, destroy culture, and undermine peace. They are spreading a large number of lies and slanders against the Soviet Union and various new democracies, disseminating hostility and contempt for the Chinese revolution and other colonial and semi-colonial national liberation movements, advocating a "Third World War," and promoting the reactionary heresies that deliberately divide culture into "Eastern culture" and "Western culture." This absurd propaganda has fueled the imperialist threat to human culture and world peace.

Chinese journalists believe that there are two very important tasks for journalists around the world that must be done by everyone. First, all journalists who are loyal to the cause of human peace and democracy should use various means to constantly denounce the reactionary words and deeds of the reactionaries that undermine friendship, exchange, and peaceful coexistence among the peoples of all countries; they should expose and oppose the brutal plans of imperialist warmongers who incite war, organize war, and expand armaments without limit to cruelly attack the people's living standards; they should resolutely refuse to serve the warmongers. On the other hand, they should spread as much news as possible that is conducive to world peace, democracy, and progress, and promote mutual understanding and economic and cultural exchanges between nations. Second, journalists in socialist countries and people's democratic countries should establish broad, close, and regular contacts with all progressive journalists in capitalist countries who love peace and support democracy, and work together to jointly defend the glorious cause of peace and democracy. Reactionary elements in the press, such as Henry Luce, Hearst, and McCormick, should be resolutely attacked. In order to accomplish the above tasks, Chinese journalists are willing to follow in the footsteps of democratic journalists around the world, work together, and strengthen the struggle!

### 进步新闻工作者团结起来　粉碎美帝挑拨战争的宣传

　　进步新闻工作者团结起来
    粉碎美帝挑拨战争的宣传
    （解放区新闻记者联合会中国青年记者学会联合发表宣言）
    【本报讯】中国解放区新闻记者联合会、中国青年记者学会，于本月二十四日在本市集会，会上一致响应召开世界拥护和平大会，并决定派代表出国参加，同时发表宣言。其原文如下：
    中国解放区的新闻工作者，以及国民党统治区内爱好和平民主的新闻工作者，热烈欢迎世界文化工作者保卫和平大会及国际民主妇联等团体的关于四月下旬在巴黎召开世界拥护和平大会的建议，并且决定推派代表，随同中国工农妇女青年文化学术各界的代表，届时前往参加。
    中国的新闻工作者深切了解：以苏联为领袖的国际和平民主反帝阵营，与以美帝国主义为首脑的国际战争反民主帝国主义阵营之间，今天正展开着尖锐的斗争，最近几个月来，美帝导演了所谓北大西洋公约，酝酿着所谓“太平洋集团”和“地中海集团”，制造侵略工具，布置侵略基地，阴谋发动新的世界战争。美帝国主义这个罪恶的战争计划是必须加以粉碎而且可以粉碎的。
    伟大的中国人民领袖毛泽东告诉过我们：帝国主义只是一只纸老虎，任何“强大”的帝国主义都是可以战胜的。我们不仅从第二次世界大战中，证实了这个真理，特别从中国人民革命战争的过程中，更深切地认识到了这个真理。在不及三年的解放战争中，我们已经用自己的力量打败了一个由美帝国主义武装到牙齿的国民党反革命军事机构。因此，只要全世界民主力量在苏联领导之下团结一致，就一定能够击溃任何帝国主义的奴役计划和战争阴谋。
    中国人民要求持久的世界和平，坚决反对新的世界战争。假如美帝国主义及其仆役们胆敢发动新的冒险，我们也将如打败日本帝国主义和打败美帝国主义支持的国民党一样，打败它们。中国人民深知：美帝国主义是中国人民的死敌，苏联则无论过去现在和将来始终是中国人民伟大的忠实的战友。中国人民誓与苏联坚决站在一起反对共同的敌人。这次世界拥护和平大会的召开，对于动员全世界亿万爱和平恨战争的广大群众，起来反对美帝国主义战争计划，是非常重要和迫切的。这个大会已得到全世界一切爱好和平的人民衷心拥护，这就使得美帝国主义，愈加孤立与愈加惶恐。可是，必须注意，帝国主义的困难愈大，它就愈加阴谋，愈要从冒险中找“出路”。所以，世界和平民主力量今后必须加倍警惕，巩固地团结在世界和平的柱石苏联的周围，更高举起我们的旗帜，更努力于我们保卫和平、民主与民族独立的斗争。
    所有资本主义国家中，绝大多数的新闻工作者和新闻事业，正被战争贩子们用作挑拨战争、毁灭文化、破坏和平的工具。他们正在大量散布对苏联及各新民主主义国家的谎言与诽谤，传播对中国革命和其他殖民地半殖民地民族解放运动的敌意与侮蔑，鼓吹“第三次世界大战”，提倡那些故意把文化分为“东方文化”和“西方文化”的反动邪说。由于这种荒谬绝伦的宣传，助长了帝国主义对于人类文化与世界和平的威胁。
    中国新闻工作者认为，当前世界新闻工作者有两件非常重大的任务，必须大家来做。第一，所有忠实于人类和平民主事业的新闻工作者，应当运用各种方式经常痛斥反动派破坏各国人民之间友谊交往与和平共存的反动言行，应当随时随地暴露与反对帝国主义战争贩子挑拨战争、组织战争、无限制扩充军备、残酷进攻人民生活水准的凶暴计划；应当坚决拒绝替战争贩子服务。另一方面，则应尽量传播有利于世界和平、民主、进步的消息，促进民族间的相互谅解与经济文化交流。第二，社会主义国家以及人民民主国家中的新闻工作者，要同资本主义国家中一切爱好和平拥护民主的进步新闻工作者，取得广泛、密切而经常的联系，大家齐心协办，共同保卫和平民主的光荣事业。对于新闻界中的反动分子，如亨利鲁斯、赫斯特、麦考密克之流，应坚决加以打击。为了实现上述任务，中国的新闻工作者愿意追随世界民主新闻工作者之后，共同努力，加强奋斗！
