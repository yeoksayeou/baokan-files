　　Xinhua News Agency, Beiping, 27th. The political representatives of the American big capitalists have recently proposed anti-communist bills in many meetings and conferences, which have been opposed by the broad masses of people. On March 12th, when the New York State Senate discussed the Camlin Bill, which would deprive the Communist Party of all political rights, three hundred representatives of the American Labor Party sat in the audience to protest. Therefore, after sharp debate, the state senate had to postpone the vote on the reactionary bill.

　　美国资本家的御用议员
    提出“反共法案”　遭到广大人民反对
    【新华社北平二十七日电】美国大资本家的政治代表们，近在许多会议会中提出反共法案，遭到广大人民的反对。三月十二日，当纽约洲参议院讨论剥夺共产党一切政治权利的坎林法案时，美国劳工党的三百位代表，列坐旁听席上，进行抗议。因此，在经过尖锐辩论后，该州参议院不得不延期表决该项反动法案。
