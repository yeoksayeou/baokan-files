　　Counter-revolutionary Agent Tong Baogong Continues to Do Evil
　　Ping City Public Security Bureau Arrests and Prosecutes According to Law

[Reported by this newspaper] After the liberation of Beiping, Kuomintang bandit gang secret agent Tong Baogong remained incorrigible and continued to persecute the people and disrupt social order. In order to maintain revolutionary order in the city and protect the interests of the people, the Beiping Municipal People's Government Public Security Bureau has arrested and prosecuted him according to law. Counter-revolutionary agent Tong Baogong was a member of the pseudo "North China Technical Corps." As early as 1946, he joined the Kuomintang pseudo "Military Statistics Bureau Tangshan Action Team," and served as a "preparatory committee member of the Workers' and Miners' Special Party Department" in Kailuan, persecuting workers and suppressing the workers' movement. After liberation, he not only refused to register, but secretly colluded with bandits Wang Xiyun (female), Yang Yinquan, Huang Jian and others in Ping to commit armed robbery. On March 4th, at Zhang's residence at No. 59 Bicai Hutong, Xidan, they robbed under the guise of scattered Kuomintang soldiers. On March 9th, they again committed armed robbery at Zhao Jianru's home at No. 29 Nanchenggen, Chongnei. After investigation by the Beiping Municipal People's Government Public Security Bureau, the facts were confirmed. On the 17th and 24th of this month, the principal offenders Tong Baogong, Wang Xiyun, Yang Yinquan, Huang Jian and others were arrested and brought to justice, and two pistols and stolen goods such as cloth and clothing were seized on the spot.
