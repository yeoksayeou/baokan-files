Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, March 21st: TASS, Berlin, March 18th: The People's Committee, under the German People's Congress, held its sixth plenary session in Berlin on the 18th. Attending the meeting were members of the People's Committee from the Soviet occupation zone and the western occupation zones, as well as representatives from various enterprises, institutions, and public organizations in Greater Berlin. Among the guests were: Semenov, political advisor to the Soviet Military Administration; the heads of delegations from People's Democratic countries stationed in Berlin; and representatives from several authorities in the western occupation zones. Nuscheke, one of the chairmen of the Presidium of the People's Committee, pointed out in his report that, as a result of the policies adopted by the Western countries, the internal situation in Germany is at its most difficult period in history. The threat to national survival and the threat of war are looming over the German people. The unfortunate situation of the country will be overcome by the national self-help of all the German people. The task of national self-help is to strive for the participation of the broad masses of people from all classes in Germany in the movement initiated by the People's Committee, to complete and exceed the tasks of the two-year economic plan in the Soviet occupation zone, and to oppose those who provoke war. Nuscheke concluded by saying that the German people will respond to the danger of splitting Germany coming from the West with Goethe's famous saying: "Strength will rise against strength, and we shall taste the joys of peace." Pieck, Chairman of the Presidium of the People's Committee, on behalf of the parliamentary group of the German Socialist Unity Party, made another effort to prevent the final split of Germany. Pieck suggested that the People's Committee send a letter to the Bonn Parliamentary Council and the Frankfurt Economic Council, proposing a joint meeting of the three parties' representatives in Braunschweig (American occupation zone) on April 8th. The People's Committee unanimously adopted Pieck's proposal and unanimously adopted the letter to Adenauer, Chairman of the Bonn Parliamentary Council, and Köhler, Chairman of the Frankfurt Economic Council, proposed by the parliamentary group of the Socialist Unity Party.

    【新华社陕北二十一日电】塔斯社柏林十八日讯：德国人民代表大会所属人民委员会十八日在柏林举行第六届全会。出席会议的有苏占区及西部占领区人民委员会委员及大柏林各企业、机关与公共团体的许多代表。来宾中有：苏联军政府政治顾问塞米诺夫、人民民主国家驻柏林的代表团团长，及几个西部占领区当局的代表。人民委员会主席团主席之一努舍克在他的报告中指出；由于西方国家所采取的政策的结果，德国内部情势正处在历史中最困难的时期。对国家生存的威胁及战争的威胁正笼罩着德国人民。国家的不幸情势将会由全德国人民的民族自助而克服。民族自助的任务就是：争取全德各阶层广大人民参加人民委员会所发起的运动，完成并超过苏占区两年经济计划的任务，反对战争挑拨者。努舍克最后说，德国人民将以哥德的名言：“力量将起来反对力量，我们将尝到和平的欢乐”，来回答出自西方的分裂德国的危险。人民委员会主席团主席皮克代表德国统一社会党党团会议再作一次阻止德国最后分裂的努力。皮克建议以人民委员会名义致函波恩议会委员会及法兰克福经济委员会，建议于四月八日在布劳苏威格（美占区）举行三方代表的联席会议。人民委员会一致通过皮克的建议，并一致通过统一社会党党团所提出的致波恩议会委员会主席阿登纳和法兰克福经济委员会主席柯斯勒的信。
