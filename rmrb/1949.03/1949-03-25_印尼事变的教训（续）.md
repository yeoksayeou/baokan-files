　　Lessons of the Indonesian Incident (Continued)
    Only under the independent and correct leadership of the proletariat, and by establishing a broad national united front, can the foundation for victory over imperialist aggression be laid!
    The reactionary ruling class of the Republic does not believe in the anti-imperialist forces of its own people and the people of the world, and moreover, it fears the anti-imperialist forces of its own people and the people of the world. Therefore, this reactionary ruling class is not only incapable of undertaking the great cause of national liberation, but also has no possibility of maintaining its own rule, so as to avoid being eliminated by the Dutch aggressors. They single-mindedly regard American and British imperialism as "saving bodhisattvas." Their view is the same as that of Nehru, Jinnah, Ba Swe, Phibunsongkhram, Quirino, Syngman Rhee, and all the representatives of the weak bourgeoisie in Eastern countries, who believe that weak nations cannot achieve independence without relying on imperialism. Even if "independence" is achieved, it is extremely difficult to survive without "U.S. aid" for economic construction. The Linggadjati Agreement signed in November 1946 due to the "mediation" of Britain and the United States, and the Renville Agreement signed in January 1948 due to direct American interference, were both accepted and signed due to this capitulationist view of the bourgeoisie.
    The Linggadjati Agreement, which gave the Netherlands an opportunity to increase its troops, and the Renville Agreement, which completely deprived Indonesia of its independent status, were both unacceptable to the Indonesian people. However, Sukarno, Hatta, and the bureaucrats of the Yogyakarta government accepted them. They betrayed the people and betrayed Indonesia's national independence, and what they gained in return was only a few months of local truce and peace. They neither drove the Dutch imperialist wolf out the front door, but welcomed the more ferocious tiger of American imperialism in through the back door.
    After the signing of the Renville Agreement, American imperialism used two magic weapons to swallow Indonesia. On the one hand, it used the Marshall Plan to buy off the Netherlands, in order to equip the Dutch army to launch a new war of aggression against Indonesia, preparing to use this to kill with a borrowed knife; on the other hand, it used another unpublicized Marshall Plan to buy off the Republic's government to eliminate the people's revolutionary forces within Indonesia. This unpublicized Marshall Plan was the agreement signed by the American Fox Company and the Yogyakarta government, through which the Indonesian Republic loaned US$100 million to purchase military supplies and other materials needed by the Indonesian government, mainly used to suppress its own people. At the same time, the Indonesian government recognized that all agricultural and mineral exports within the Indonesian Republic would be monopolized by the American Fox Company for ten years.
    This Fox Agreement, although not bearing the name of the Marshall Plan and still not public to this day, is no different in nature from the European Marshall Plan and the American military and economic aid to the reactionary governments of China, Greece, and Turkey. The Renville Agreement and the Fox Agreement took the direct interference of the United States in the internal affairs of the Indonesian Republic as an attached political condition. In order to fulfill this political condition and carry out the orders of American imperialism, the Hatta cabinet took anti-communist and anti-people actions within the Republic in September 1948, first by excluding the Communist Party, the Socialist Youth Party, the Labor Party, and other left-wing revolutionary parties from the Republic's government. Afterwards, it carried out open arrests and massacres of the Communist Party and all progressive people, and implemented military encirclement and suppression. In September and October, 35,000 workers, peasants, and youth in the Yogyakarta and Solo areas were imprisoned, and many people's leaders were brutally murdered. From this time on, in order to carry out the orders of American imperialism, the Republic's government army was no longer used to defend against Dutch aggression, but was used to attack its own people.
    In order to carry out the orders of American imperialism, the Hatta cabinet even refused to establish friendly relations with the Soviet Union and refused to exchange consuls and diplomats with the Soviet Union. In this way, the Yogyakarta government, like the bourgeois reactionary governments of India and Burma, not only adopted an anti-people line domestically, but also was unwilling to deal with the world's people's democratic forces.
    After the signing of the Renville Agreement, the Republic's government led by Sukarno and Hatta no longer represented the Indonesian people at all, but only represented the interests of imperialism. Especially since the Yogyakarta government, after the left-wing parties were forced to withdraw in September 1949, had become a puppet regime, it was completely isolated among the people at home and abroad. Although the Dutch aggressors had troops stationed on the border, preparing to attack at any time, the Hatta cabinet thought that as long as they held on to the thigh of Wall Street monopoly capital, they could survive for a while. But the foolish Yogyakarta bureaucrats did not realize that after they had let the wolf and the tiger into the house, no matter what the result, one thing was certain: that they themselves would be eaten. When the Netherlands began its full-scale offensive, American imperialism pretended on the surface that it did not completely agree with the Netherlands' actions, but in reality, it thoroughly encouraged and supported the Dutch aggressors in completing the military occupation of the Indonesian Republic. The shameless and foolish Indonesian bourgeois rulers first separated themselves from the people, then threw themselves into the arms of imperialism, and completely opposed themselves to the people's forces at home and abroad, and finally allowed imperialism to devour them without resistance. This is the most recent example of the reactionary bourgeoisie in Eastern nations bringing about a shameful end by their own doing.
    From the birth of the Indonesian Republic, the Indonesian proletariat has strived to unite the entire Indonesian nation to jointly resist imperialist aggression. However, before the reorganization of the leading organs of the Indonesian Communist Party in the second half of 1948, the Indonesian Communist Party did not pay enough attention to the serious and fundamental political task of establishing its own independent leadership over the anti-imperialist struggle. Although the Indonesian bourgeois government adopted a reactionary policy of obliterating the political role of the Indonesian proletariat and its party from the very beginning, this reactionary policy did not encounter the Indonesian Communist Party's timely vigilance and strong counterattack for a long period. The Indonesian Communist Party's weak attitude towards bourgeois reactionaries could not but lead to weakness and powerlessness towards imperialist aggressors at the same time. The Dutch government not only took advantage of the Indonesian bourgeoisie's capitulationism, but also took advantage of the Indonesian Communist Party's weak attitude for a long period of time, in order to restore its own strength and launch two full-scale offensives. After the second half of 1948, the Indonesian Communist Party recognized and corrected this past mistake.

　　印尼事变的教训（续）
    只有在无产阶级的独立的正确的领导之下，建立广泛的民族统一战线，才能奠定战胜帝国主义侵略的基础！
    共和国的反动统治阶级，不相信本国人民和世界人民的反帝力量，而且害怕本国人民和世界人民的反帝力量。因此，这个反动统治阶级不但不能担当起民族解放的伟业，而且也没有可能保持自己的统治权，以避免为荷兰侵略者所消灭。他们一心一意只是把美英帝国主义看作“救命王菩萨”，他们的看法，正和尼赫鲁、金纳、达钦努、銮披汶、季里诺、李承晚，以及所有东方国家软弱的资产阶级的代表们的看法一样，认为弱小民族不依靠帝国主义是不能获得独立的。即使获得了“独立”，汉有“美援”以进行经济建设，也断难生存下去。一九四六年十一月，由于英美等国“调停”而签订的林牙椰蒂协定，一九四八年一月由于美国一手干涉而签订的愉维尔协定，都是由于这一资产阶级的投降主义看法而被接受签字的。
    使荷兰获得了增兵机会的林牙椰蒂协定，使印尼完全丧失了独立地位的伦维尔协定，都是为印尼人民所不能接受的。但苏加诺、哈达及日惹政府的官僚们，却接受了。他们出卖了人民，出卖了印尼的民族独立，而换来的只是几个月的局部的停战和平。他们既没有从前门把荷兰帝国主义这条狼赶跑，却又从后门迎接进来了美帝国主义这条更凶恶的虎。
    伦维尔协定签字以后，美国帝国主义是使用了两个法宝来吞食印尼的。它一方面用马歇尔计划收买荷兰，以装备发动侵略印尼的新战争的荷兰军队，准备藉此借刀杀人；一方面则用另一个不公开的马歇尔计划，收卖共和国政府以消灭印尼内部的人民革命力量。这个不公开的马歇尔计划，就是由美国福克斯公司和日惹政府签订协定，经印尼共和国贷款十万万美元，用以购买印尼政府所需要的主要用来镇压本国人民的军火及其他物资。同时，印尼政府则承认印尼共和国境内一切农矿产物的输出贸易，在十年内，由美国福克斯公司垄断独占。
    这个福克斯协定，虽然不用马歇尔计划的名称，而且至今还是不公开的，但其性质和欧洲的马歇尔计划，以及美国对中国、希腊、土耳其反动政府的军事经济援助，并无二致。伦维尔协定和福克斯协定，是以美国直接干涉印尼共和国内政作为附带的政治条件的。由于履行这一政治条件，执行美帝国主义的命令，哈达内阁乃于一九四八年九月，在共和国内部，采取反共反人民的行动，首先是从共和国政府中，排斥共产党、社会主义青年党、劳工党以及其他左翼革命党派。其后，又对共产党及一切进步人士，进行公开逮捕屠杀，并实行军事围剿。在九、十月间。日惹、梭罗一带，工农青年有三万五千人被押入监狱，有不少人民领袖遭受惨杀。从这时候起，为了执行美国帝国主义的命令，共和国政府军队已不再被用以防卫荷兰侵略，而被用以进攻本国人民了。
    为了执行美帝国主义的命令，哈达内阁中甚至拒绝与苏联建立友好关系，拒绝与苏联交换领事和外交官。这样，日惹政府和印度、缅甸的资产阶级反动政府一样，不但在国内采取反人民的路线，而且也不愿和世界人民民主力量打交道。
    伦维尔协定签字后，苏加诺、哈达领导的共和国政府，已经完全不再代表印尼人民，而只代表帝国主义的利益了。特别自从一九四九年九月左冀政党被迫退出以后的日惹政府，已变成傀儡政权，在国内外人民中间，已完全陷于孤立。虽然荷兰侵略者陈兵边境，准备随时进攻，但哈达内阁以为只要捧住了华尔街垄断资本的一条大腿，就可以苟安一时。但愚蠢的日惹官僚们全然没有想到，当他们把狼和虎引进屋子以后，不管结果怎样，有一件事是可以确定的：那就是他们自己被吃掉。当荷兰起始全面进攻以后，美国帝国主义在表面上装着并不完全同意荷兰的行动，但实际上却澈头澈尾地鼓励和支援了荷兰侵略者，以完成对印尼共和国的军事侵占。无耻而愚蠢的印尼资产阶级统治者们，他们首先使自己和人民脱离，其后是投入帝国主义怀抱，而使自己和国内外的人民力量完全对立起来，最后是毫无抵抗地让帝国主义吃掉自己。这就是东方民族中反动的资产阶级自作自受造成可耻结局的一个最近的例子。
    印尼的无产阶级从印尼共和国诞生的时候起，就努力从事于团结全印尼民族以共同抵抗帝国主义的侵略。但是在一九四八年下半年印尼共产党领导机关改组以前，印尼共产党在建立自己对于反帝国主义斗争的独立领导这个严重的根本的政治任务上，没有给予足够的注意。虽然印尼资产阶级政府一开始就采取抹煞印尼无产阶级及其政党的政治作用的反动方针，但是这种反动方针在一个长时期内并未遇到印尼共产党的及时警惕和坚强的反击。印尼共产党对于资产阶级反动分子的软弱态度，不能不同时引导到对于帝国主义侵略分子的软弱无力。荷兰政府不但利用了印尼资产阶级的投降主义，而且利用了印尼共产党在一个长时期内的软弱态度，才得以恢复自己的力量，并且举行了两次全面进攻。在一九四八年下半年以后，印尼共产党是认识了并且纠正了过去的这一个错误。
