　　Australian Communist Party Supports Thorez Declaration
  　Will Use Force to Repel Aggressive Force
    [Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 8th] TASS, Sydney, 5th: Sydney newspapers in Australia have recently published a statement by Sharkey, General Secretary of the Communist Party of Australia, which states: "I support the declaration of Thorez, leader of the French Communist Party. The Soviet Union is a peace-loving country and will not declare war on any country. The Soviet Union will only rise up to fight when it is attacked." Sharkey pointed out: "If Soviet troops come to Australia while pursuing aggressors, the Australian working class will welcome them, just as the people of Europe welcomed the Soviet troops when they were liberated by them. The task of the Communist Party is to fight to prevent war and to strive to educate the masses of the people against war. But if the fascists in Australia use force to stop the workers from striving for this goal, the Communists will tell the workers to use force to repel force."

　　澳共支持多列士声明
  　将用武力来迎击侵略武力
    【新华社陕北八日电】塔斯社悉尼五日讯：澳大利亚悉尼报纸顷登载澳大利亚共产党总书记夏基的声明，内称：“我支持法共领袖多烈士的声明。苏联是爱好和平的国家，它不会对任何国家宣战。苏联只有在它自己受攻击时才会起而作战。”夏基指出：“如果苏军在追赶侵略者时来到澳大利亚，澳洲工人阶级就会欢迎他们，正如欧洲人民在被苏军解放时欢迎苏军那样。共产党的任务是在为阻止战争而斗争，为教育人民大众反对战争而努力。但是如果澳洲的法西斯分子用武力来阻止工人争取这一目标，共产党人就将告诉工人们要用武力来迎击武力。”
