[Hebei Central News] Workers in Baoding, Botou, Gaoyang and other cities, freed from the threat of hunger and unemployment, are enthusiastically seeking education and actively participating in worker after-school programs and people's schools. Workers account for more than 80 percent of those participating in the people's schools in 45th Street and 48th Street in Baoding City. Zhang Yusheng, a porter, said: "I've been eager to learn for a long time, and I have to learn ten characters a day!" Thirty-two porters organized a literacy class, and they themselves set out six learning rules, such as arriving at school on time, asking for leave if something comes up, and not making loud noises in class.

When the Botou City Federation of Trade Unions called on workers to study, the third branch of the dock workers' union in the city organized all its members to read newspapers and learn to read. During the enemy and puppet rule, these dock workers were subjected to years of hunger and were deprived of their right to education. After liberation, the lives of the workers have been improved. They are all very happy when they are told to study. They immediately made a blackboard and wrote a few characters on it every day for everyone to learn to write and read. When there are more people, they read the newspaper, and their mood is very high. Recently, Chiang Kai-shek made a false peace, and Chairman Mao put forward eight peace conditions. The workers understood it very well from reading the newspaper. Ma Wanliang, an old worker in his fifties, did not know a single character, but he could recite these eight conditions. He and another worker, Jiao Huade, composed several songs, including an anti-fake peace song with these sentences: "The war has been fought for two and a half years, eliminating four million Kuomintang troops, liberating Northeast and North China, and the army is about to attack south of the Yangtze River. When the Chiang bandits saw that things were not going well, they wanted to play tricks and make a false peace, to rest and breathe, and come back to kill the people..." Worker Xu Hongsheng does not know how to read, he said: "It's suffocating not knowing how to read!" Therefore, he is very active in learning. Whenever he has time, he looks at the worker's textbook and writes. At night, lying in bed, he still ponders how to write that character. Yang Fushun, an old worker of 49 years old, is very attentive in his studies. He used to be illiterate, but now he knows almost everyone's name in the trade union.

The Botou Zhonghe Tobacco Factory, Jushengquan Winery, and Electric Light Company have also established worker after-school programs one after another, and all the employees of the factory have participated in the study. At the Zhonghe Tobacco Factory, when the learning whistle blows, everyone arrives quickly. Worker Li Changfa studies hard every night after everyone else has gone to bed. Xie Baoheng, a worker at the winery, made a blackboard himself, wrote the characters he learned during the day on the blackboard, and put it in the dormitory. After he learned it, he taught it to others. Now, the learning of ordinary workers has achieved results. For example, Li Changfa, a worker at Zhonghe, can almost read the entire worker's textbook; Yu Xihai studied for half a year when he was a child, and can now read the newspaper after this period of study.

The 120 employees of the Gaoyang Jianhua Dyeing and Rolling Factory established a study committee led by the trade union and established a worker after-school program. Every night, employees go to after-school programs to study. After studying for two months or so, the class consciousness of the workers in the factory has been improved, and they have overcome some bad phenomena in their thinking and work style in the past, strengthened their organization and discipline, and become more active in production. For example, worker Cui Qingliu said: "In the past, I didn't know what the conditions were for joining the Communist Party, but now I understand, I must strive for these conditions to join the Communist Party!" Through study, the workers have understood the fundamental difference between the current state-owned factories and the factories of the Kuomintang bureaucratic capitalists in the past, and realized that state-owned enterprises are the cause of the people and the workers are the masters of the factory. Not only have they improved politically, but they have also made great achievements culturally. They have studied seventeen or eighteen lessons in the textbook. Worker Qi Baisui used to be illiterate, but now he has learned 350 characters. Dai Guanying and Cui Lizhi used to be unable to do abacus calculations, but now they can calculate simple accounts. The workers also created a question-and-answer learning method to promote the progress of learning.

　　保定等地工人努力学习
  　积极参加业余学校
    【冀中讯】摆脱了饥饿和失业威胁的保定、泊头、高阳等市工人，热烈要求学习，积极参加工人业余学校与民校。保定市四十五街、四十八街的民校，参加学习者工人占百分之八十以上。脚行工人张玉生说：“我早就蹩着劲学习，我一天非学十个字不行！”有三十二个脚行工人组织了识字班，他们自己并订出了按时到校，有事请假，上课不大声喧哗等六条学习纪律。
    泊头市当市工会号召工人学习时，该市码头第三分工会即组织全体会员进行读报和识字。这些码头工人在敌伪统治时，长年累月受着饥饿的压迫，学习权利全被剥夺。解放后工人生活已得到改善，一提学习都非常高兴，立即制了块黑板，每天写上几个字大家学写学念，人多了就念报，情绪很高。最近蒋介石闹假和平，毛主席提出八项和平条件，工人们从读报中都很明白，五十多岁的老工人马万良一字不识，可是这八项条件他都能背过来。并且和另一个工人焦化德编了好几个歌子，其中有一个反假和平歌有这样几句：“战争打了二年半，消灭国民党军四百万，东北华北全解放，大军就要打江南，蒋匪一见事不好，要耍花样闹假和平，歇歇喘喘换口气，卷土重来杀人民……”工人徐鸿升不识字，他说：“不识字活闷死！”因此，他学习非常积极，一有空就看着工人课本写起来，晚上躺在被窝里，还捉摸那个字怎么着写。四十九岁的老工人杨福顺学习很用心，过去一字不识，现在工会里每个人的名字，认的差不多了。
    泊头中和烟厂、聚盛泉酒厂、电灯公司也都先后建立了工人业余学校，厂里的职工都参加了学习。中和烟厂工人，学习哨一响，很快就到齐了。工人李长法每天晚上别人都睡了，他还在认真学习。酒厂工人谢宝恒自己制了块黑板，白天学的字写在黑板上放到宿舍里，自己学会了还教给别人。现在一般工人的学习均已获得成绩，如中和的工人李长法差不多把工人课本全能念下来；于西海小时念过半年书，经过这一时期的学习已能看报。
    高阳建华染轧工厂的一百二十个职工，建立了以工会为主的学习委员会，并成立了工人业余学校。每天晚上职工们都上业余学校学习。学习了两个来月，全厂工人提高了阶级觉悟，克服了过去在思想作风上一些不良现象，加强了组织性、纪律性，生产上也积极起来。如工人崔清流说：“过去我不知道加入共产党有什么条件，这回可明白了，我一定要争取这些条件好参加共产党！”经过学习工人们都了解了现在的国营工厂与过去国民党官僚资本家工厂的根本不同，认识到国营企业是人民的事业，工人是工厂的主人。不但在政治上提高了，文化上也有很大成绩，课本都学习了十七八课。工人祁百岁过去不识字，现在已学会三百五十个字。戴冠英、崔礼祉过去都不会珠算，现在已能算简单的帐。工人们还创造了互问互答的学习方式以促进学习的进步。
