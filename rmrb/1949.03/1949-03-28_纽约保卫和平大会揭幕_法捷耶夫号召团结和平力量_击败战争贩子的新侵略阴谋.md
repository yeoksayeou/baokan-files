Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, March 27th: TASS, New York dispatch: The World Congress of Intellectuals in Defense of Peace, held in New York, opened on the 25th. The Soviet and other national delegations attending the congress, as well as the Americans who initiated the congress, held a large-scale press conference before the meeting. The chairman of the congress, Shapley, first gave a speech, expressing his belief that understanding between the Soviet Union and the the United States is a necessary condition for achieving lasting peace. The work of the congress is to hope to contribute to seeking solutions to peace issues. He said that the State Department should be fully responsible for the absence of representatives from some countries at the congress because it refused to issue passports and prohibited them from coming to the United States. He pointed out: The congress has received enthusiastic response from progressive American intellectuals, and is "opposed and resisted by those who profit from war and war preparations." Fadeyev, the head of the Soviet delegation, said: Millions of people who participated in or witnessed World War II still feel the horror of war. But in some countries, there are also some people who think that international problems can be solved by force. Armies and armaments have not decreased, but have increased. Military blocs that threaten the peaceful coexistence of the world's people are being established. But as shown by the peace movements in various countries, the majority of people around the world yearn for peace. Most importantly, the forces of all sincere friends of peace should unite, regardless of political beliefs, because only the joint efforts of all true peace advocates can defeat the enemies of peace. The head of the Polish delegation, Goffman, and the head of the Czechoslovak delegation, Grannik, then made brief speeches. British representative, the philosopher Stapleton, criticized the State Department for refusing to grant passport visas to British representatives. West African representative, scientist Amedon, fiercely criticized the insulting entry procedures of the US Immigration Bureau, which forced him to fingerprint and sign a written statement. Cuban representative, literary professor Marinello, also protested the US State Department's refusal to issue visas to representatives from other Latin American countries.

　　纽约保卫和平大会揭幕
    法捷耶夫号召团结和平力量 
    击败战争贩子的新侵略阴谋
    【新华社北平二十七日电】塔斯社纽约讯：在纽约召开的世界科学文化界拥护和平大会已于二十五日开幕。出席大会的苏联与各国代表团，以及发起召开大会的美国人士在会前举行了大规模的记者招待会，大会主席沙普莱首先致辞，表示相信苏美之间的谅解是达到持久和平的必要条件。大会的工作就是希望在寻求解决和平问题上有所贡献。他说国务院对若干国家之没有代表出席大会，应负完全责任，因为它拒发护照、禁止他们来美。他指出：大会得到美国进步知识分子的热烈响应，而“为那些从战争和战争准备中获利的人们所反对、所阻抗。”苏联代表团团长法捷耶夫说：成百万的参加过或看见过第二次世界大战的人们，还对战争感觉到可怕。但是在某些国家中也存在着一些人，以为可以用武力来解决国际问题。军队和军备没有减少，反而增加了。威胁世界人民和平共存的军事集团正在建立。但是在如各国和平运动所显示的那样，全世界大多数人民渴望和平，最重要的是：一切真诚的和平之友的力量应不分政治信仰，团结一致，因为只有一切真正和平拥护者的联合努力，才能击败和平的敌人。波兰代表团团长高夫曼和捷克斯洛伐克代表团团长格朗尼克等接着发表简短谈话。英国代表哲学家斯塔波顿斥责国务院拒绝予英国代表以护照签证。西非代表科学家阿梅敦猛烈抨击美国移民局侮辱性的入境手续，强迫他按手印签写书面声明。古巴代表文学教授马林吉奥亦抗议美国务院拒发签证与拉丁美洲其他国家代表。
