　　Inner Mongolia Government Organizes Mountainous Area Masses
    Actively Engage in Hunting Production
  　Trade Bureaus in Various Regions Fairly Purchase Furs
    [Xinhua News Agency, Ulanhot, 9th] The Inner Mongolia Autonomous Government is actively organizing the masses in mountainous areas to engage in hunting production. Hunting is one of the important sideline productions for the people of the Inner Mongolia region. In the past two months of winter, the people of Keerqin Middle Banner hunted 62 wolves, 8 wild boars, 890 foxes and raccoon dogs, and more than 7,500 lynx, badgers, weasels, and rabbits. The League government is continuing to organize hunting and has instructed trade bureaus in various regions to purchase various animal furs at the fairest prices, provide food and various necessities according to the needs of hunters, and has selected several central areas to provide targeted loan support for hunting. Hunters in areas such as the Nawen Muren League (province) and Bayan Banner (county), who rely solely on mountain forest hunting for a living, have organized many hunters' mountain forest teams, which, in addition to protecting the mountain forests, also engage in hunting. The mountain forest teams also regularly convene meetings to study and improve hunting techniques. Hunters in the semi-nomadic hunting areas of the League have generally been allocated land and houses during the land reform movement, and many have also engaged in both agriculture and hunting. Animals that can be hunted in the Inner Mongolia region include deer, otters, bears, and beavers, which can be used as valuable medicinal materials. According to a survey by the Nawen Muren League, hunters are divided into two types: those who live in the mountains and forests and those who live in the countryside. Those who live in the mountain forest areas rely on hunting for a living and often migrate with their prey. However, during the period of the puppet Manchukuo regime, the Japanese invaders blockaded the mountain forests, prohibited them from migrating, and deprived them of all valuable prey, making life very difficult. Among the hunters living in rural areas, some were driven down from the mountains by the Japanese invaders in the past. During the puppet Manchukuo regime, they were subjected to double exploitation. On the one hand, the Japanese invaders demanded grain from them, and on the other hand, they still forced them to hunt deer fetuses or furs, and the prey was not given any compensation and was completely deprived. Because during the period of Japanese puppet rule, hunting required a guarantor, coupled with a lack of firearms and ammunition, some of the hunters had switched to agricultural production. It was not until after the liberation of Inner Mongolia on "August 15th" that, under the leadership of the Communist Party, a democratic government was established, and the hunters gained the freedom to hunt and received various encouragements and help. The democratic government also pays attention to appropriately combining hunting and agriculture to develop production and protect the livelihood of hunters.

　　内蒙政府组织山区群众
    积极进行打猎生产
  　各地贸易局公平收买毛皮
    【新华社乌兰浩特九日电】内蒙自治政府正在积极地组织山区群众进行打猎生产。打猎是内蒙地区人民重要的副业生产之一。科尔沁中旗人民在去冬两个多月中，猎获狼六十二只，野猪八口，狐狸、貉子八百九十只，猞猁、獾子、黄鼠狼、兔子等七千五百余只。该盟政现仍继续组织打猎，并已责成各地贸易局以最公平的价格收买各种猎物毛皮，根据猎户需要，供以食粮及各种应用物品；并选择了几个中心区，进行有重点的贷款扶助营猎。纯靠山林打猎为生的纳文慕仁盟（省）巴彦旗（县）等地猎民，组织了许多猎民山林队，除保护山林之外，并进行打猎。山林队还经常定期召集会议，研究改进打猎技术。该盟半游猎区的猎民，在土地改革运动中普遍地分得了土地、房屋，许多都已兼营农业和狩猎。内蒙地区可以猎获之动物，有可作贵重药材的鹿、水獭、和熊、悍獭等。根据纳文慕仁盟的调查，猎人分居住于山林与农村的两种。住山林区者，依靠狩猎为生，常把猎取物迁移。但在伪满统治时期，日寇封锁山林，禁止他们迁移，并且剥夺了他们一切贵重的猎物，生活非常困苦。住农村之猎民中，有一部分是过去被日寇赶下山来的。在伪满统治时他们受双重剥削，日寇一方面向他们要粮，另一方面仍然强迫他们去打鹿胎或皮张，猎获物不给任何代价，全部加以剥夺。因为在日伪统治时，打猎必须有保人，加以枪械弹药缺乏，所以猎民中有一部分已转营农业生产。直到“八一五”内蒙解放后，在共产党领导下，成立了民主政府，猎民才获得了打猎的自由，并且得到了各种鼓励和帮助。民主政府并注意使打猎与农业适当结合，以发展生产，保障猎民的生活。
