Rao Yang Convenes Experienced Farmers to Discuss Cotton Planting Experiences

[Ji Zhong Electric] The Rao Yang County Party Committee convened more than twenty experienced veteran farmers on February 23rd to discuss field production experiences. At the meeting, everyone introduced cotton planting methods, which are summarized below:

1.  Select soil and cultivate the land well: Old white soil (sandy loam) and mixed soil (a mixture of loam, sand, and clay) are most suitable for planting cotton. In addition, saline-alkali land is more resistant to alkali when planting cotton than other crops. Meng land (surface sandy block soil, lower layer clay core soil) grows large cotton bolls. Before sowing, the land should be cultivated well, preferably harrowed several times, each time shallower than the last, so that the surface soil is looser (to retain moisture and withstand drought) and the lower layer is firmer, which is good for seedling emergence.

2.  Seed selection and soaking. Plant more foreign cotton, as foreign cotton has a higher yield. Tuozi cotton is the best variety, with an even higher yield than general foreign cotton, longer fiber, and is also suitable for spinning. Cotton seeds must be soaked: generally, the cotton seeds are placed in a basin or urn (first wash the basin and urn clean, avoid oil, salt, and uncleanliness), and the water is boiled to scald the seeds. After scalding, stir the seeds to make the seed heat evenly. The germination of seeds is affected by the different cotton varieties, different seed coat thicknesses, different old and new cotton seeds from previous years and within one year, and different cold and warm weather during seed soaking. Generally, they germinate in about three days. If it has not germinated by this afternoon for tomorrow's planting, the seeds can be taken out and piled on the ground, and the cotton seeds should be tightly covered with a quilt or several layers of flower wrap. They can germinate overnight. If they have germinated in the urn, and the land has not been harrowed, and planting cannot be done today, pour cold water into the urn to soak the cotton seeds, and then take them out for use when sowing.

3.  There are two simple and easy methods of sowing: One is to mix the seeds with ash or sandy soil after soaking, and use a drill to plant one seed every other hole. The depth of planting should be determined according to the wetness of the land. If the ground is wet, wait for it to dry a little before rolling, and roll it well; if it is not rolled well, it is afraid of wind drying. If the ground is dry, it is necessary to plant with a hoe and sow, and then hoe it with a rake six or seven days later, so that it will come out completely. But don't wait too long to hoe, as it is often said: "Hoe on the seventh, not on the eighth." Another method is to use a drill to remove the dry soil, remove the wet soil, and then press the seeds in piles, and then roll it with a roller. This method saves more seeds than the previous method and is easier to emerge, but it is necessary to grasp the uniformity of depth to ensure complete emergence. The time for planting cotton starts after the Grain Rain solar term. There is an agricultural saying: "Plant cotton early in Grain Rain, late in Lesser Fullness, and just right in Start of Summer." Or "When the jujube buds sprout, plant cotton." Generally, it is better to be early than late.

4.  Management methods: The main thing in planting cotton is management. If it is not managed well, it will grow crazy branches and produce less cotton. Management is divided into two aspects. One is to pinch off branches and tips. After the cotton seedlings emerge completely, it is best to first remove the crowded seedlings. After growing two or three small leaves, leave seedlings according to the strength of the soil, leaving one strong seedling every foot, foot and a half, two feet, or more than two feet, to prevent the seedlings that were set too small from being damaged and lacking seedlings. Second, when it grows more than half a foot high, remove the crazy branches (branches that do not grow bolls), especially after the beginning of autumn, check every two or three days, and do not consider it finished after one check. According to the strength of the soil and the development of cotton seedlings, pinch off all the cotton tips around the Start of Autumn. "Hoe cotton seven or eight times, bolls like eggs." Cotton must be hoeed many times, and it must be hoeed every time after watering or raining, so as to avoid the water vapor steaming off the bolls. It is considered finished only after hoeing until the cotton bolls grow large.

When is the Best Time to Sow Barley?

[Our Newspaper] The Agricultural Extension Station of Jianping Special District, Chahar Province, reported the experience of sowing barley early. The original report said: There are different opinions on the issue of the time of sowing barley. We have done an experiment and now introduce the situation of the experiment as follows: We took the Spring Equinox as the standard, planting once on the Spring Equinox, once five days before the Spring Equinox, once ten days before the Spring Equinox, once five days after the Spring Equinox, and once ten days after the Spring Equinox, for a total of five periods of sowing. The results showed that the best planting was ten days before the Spring Equinox, and the worst planting was ten days after the Spring Equinox. The growth situation is: The ones planted ten days earlier grow relatively short, with harder stalks, are not easy to fall over, mature earlier, have the highest yield, and the grains are large and full. The ones planted ten days after the Spring Equinox are the opposite. The others gradually decreased from the previous ten-day period.

    饶阳召集老农座谈植棉经验
    【冀中电】饶阳县委于二月二十三日，召集了二十多个有经验的老农，座谈田间生产的经验、会上大家介绍了种棉的方法，现摘记如下：一、先择土质，将地耕好：老白土地（沙性较大的壤土）和两合土地（壤土、沙土、粘土的混合土）种棉花最适宜。另外青硷地种棉花比种别的庄稼更耐硷，蒙地（表层沙块土下层粘心土）种棉花长的桃大。播种前要把地耕好，最好打耙几次，一次比一次耙的浅，使土质表层较松（保持水分，能耐旱）下层较实这样好出苗。二、选种与浸种。要多种洋花，洋花产量大，如脱字棉就是最好的一种，它比一般洋花产量还大，绒性又长，也适合纺纱用。种棉花必须浸种：一般是将棉籽放在盆里或瓮内（先把盆瓮洗刷干净，切忌油性盐性不洁净），把水烧开，用水烫籽，烫后搅籽，使籽热度均匀。俟后每隔二、三小时将籽搅拌一次。棉籽因棉种不同、籽皮厚薄不同、往年陈棉籽和一年内新棉籽不同、浸籽时天气冷暖等不同，致影响种籽发芽。一般的在三数天左右发芽。如明天播种今天下午还未出芽，可将籽捞出，堆于地上，用被子或用几层花包将棉花籽遮护严密，一夜即能出芽；如在瓮内已出牙，地未打耙好，今天不能耩，即在耩内灌上冷水，使水浸透棉籽，播种时再捞出使用。三、播种有两种简便易行的方法：一种是浸泡种后，用灰或用沙土把籽种拌好，用耧隔一个眼耩一个眼。耩深耩浅须根据地的湿干而定。如地皮湿，等干一下再砘，要砘好；不砘好怕风干。地干要耩挑，撒种后隔六七天再用耙挑一下，这样出来的齐全。但不要过了日子再挑，常说：“挑七不挑八”。再一种是用耧把干土挑去，挑出湿土后再把种籽一堆一堆的按上，再用砘子砘一下，这样比前一种方法省籽又好出来，不过要掌握深浅一律，以便出苗齐全。植棉的时间，在谷雨后即开始，农谚有：“谷雨早，小满迟，立夏的棉花正当时。”或“枣芽发，种棉花。”一般宜早不宜迟。四、收拾的方法：种棉花主要的在收拾，收拾不好就要长疯杈，棉花就产的少。收拾分两方面。一是拿杈打尖。棉苗出齐后，最好先把堆挤的提开，等长到二、三个小叶后，按地质强弱留苗，间隔一尺、一尺五、二尺或二尺以上留一棵强壮的，定好棵，以防太小时定好的棵尖受损害缺了苗。二是长到了半尺多高将疯杈（不长桃的杈）掏掉，特别是入秋后每隔两三天要检查一次，不能拿一次就算完事。按照地质强弱，棉苗发育情形在立秋前后，把棉尖一律掏下。“棉锄七八遍，桃子象鸡蛋。”棉花必须要多锄，每次浇地或下雨后就必须锄一遍，以免被水蒸气将桃蒸掉。至锄到棉桃长大后才算完事。
    大麦播种何时最适宜
    【本报讯】察省建屏专区农业推广场，报导提早种大麦经验。报导原文称：大麦播种时间的早晚问题，纷说不一，我们曾作了一试验今将试验的情形介绍如下：我们是以春分节为标准，春分种一次，春分前五天种一次，前十天种一次，春分后五天种一次，后十天种一次，共分五个时期播种。结果春分前十天种的最好，后十天种的最坏。生长情形是：前十天种的比较长的矮，秆较硬，不容易倒，成熟较早，产量最高，粒大而充实。在春分后十天种的则与此相反。其他都是从前十天一期一期减退下来的。
