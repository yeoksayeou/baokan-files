　　The Ping Municipal Government Accepts People's Accusations and Arrests the Arch-Tyrant Liu Dehai
    [This Newspaper's Dispatch] The Public Security Eleventh Sub-bureau of the Beiping Municipal People's Government, having accepted accusations from the people, arrested Liu Dehai, an old tyrant with the nickname "Living阎王" who had been running rampant in the Guang'anmen area of Ping City for more than 40 years, on the 21st. He is currently under interrogation.
    Liu Dehai, a native of Beiping, is 67 years old and resides at 45 Dachuandian, Outer Fourth District, Beiping. According to accusations from the masses, his crimes include: (1) Forcing neighbors to give him gifts every year and on holidays. (2) Harboring thieves. The famous pickpockets "Little Li Zi" and "Little Korean" often lurked in his home, and he would take a cut from their earnings. (3) An old woman, the lonely Granny Guan, died of a serious illness in 1943. He immediately stripped off all of Guan's clothes, leaving her naked, and buried her with only a straw mat. Guan's family property was all swallowed up by him. In the same year, a family of three surnamed Wang who lived at 42 Dachuandian died, and a family of two surnamed Li in the same courtyard died. Their family property was all seized by him. (4) After liberation, when the People's Liberation Army was clearing landmines in the suburbs of Ping, he spread rumors to the masses, saying, "The cannons are booming, how long can the Eighth Route Army stay? At most a few more months!" (5) The Eleventh Bao work team held a mass meeting in February of this year, and he also attended. When the masses reported to the work team that he had done bad things, he threatened the masses, saying, "How many days can the Eighth Route Army stay? We'll settle accounts after they're gone! Be careful, I'll slaughter you one by one!"
