　　Prevent Flooding and Sand Encroachment
  　Planting Trees Along Rivers in Xingtai
    [Our Newspaper] Xingtai has two major rivers: the Baima River and the Qili River. The areas along the rivers are mostly sandy beaches, which are of little benefit to the people. (In the past, there was a grove of willow trees covering more than 300 mu, but they were all cut down by the Japanese devils during their occupation.) Therefore, when there is heavy rain, the land is either flooded or covered by sand. To prevent the above situations, the Bureau of Agriculture and Forestry has sent Comrade Wang Tai and two others to assist the county government in mobilizing the masses to plant trees. The focus is initially on the Dongxi Shawo Village and Liu Huliangshe Village along the Baima River. Within two days, a total of 34,766 trees were planted. The enthusiasm of the general public is extremely high, and they rush to the planting site as soon as they hear the sound of gongs. This planting is based on the nature of the sandy land, with a focus on planting small-leaf poplars (also known as Qiuliang trees) and willows. Pear, peach, and apricot trees are planted in mixed sandy soil. On the riverbank, they have created a "mother forest" that can block wind and prevent floods. The method is as follows: Use a willow branch that is more than one or two years old and press the middle of it into the soil, leaving the two ends exposed. It is best to press one end, burying the root and exposing one tip, using four to seven branches per pit. For thicker branches, they can be cut into sections of two to three chi, with half a chi exposed above the ground. 　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　(Wang Tai, Mei Yu)

　　防止水淹沙盖
  　邢台沿河植树
    【本报讯】邢台有两条大河：白马河和七里河，河旁尽是些沙滩，对老百姓没有什么好处，（过去这里有一片三百多亩地的柳树，但都被日本鬼子在时砍光了。）所以现在下大雨时，不是水淹地，就是沙盖地。为防止上述情况，农林局特派王泰同志等三人协助县府发动群众造林。首先以白马河沿岸的东西沙窝村及刘胡良舍等村为重点进行，两天内共栽树三万四千七百六十六棵，一般群众情绪极为高涨，听见锣声即争相前往。此次栽种系依沙地性质，多栽小叶杨（又名秋凉树）和柳树，在沙土混合地则种梨、桃、杏树。在河岸他们造了一种“母林”，能挡风，又能防水。其方法是：用一根长过一、二年的柳条，用土压住当中，使两头露尖；最好是压住一头，把根压住，露一个尖，一坑可用四至七根。粗的可截成二尺至三尺为一节，地面露半尺即可。 　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　（王泰、美玉）
