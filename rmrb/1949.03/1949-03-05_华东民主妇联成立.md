　　Xinhua News Agency, East China, 27th: The First East China Women's Congress was held on the 12th of this month and successfully concluded on the 17th, lasting five days. In addition to summarizing the achievements and experiences of women's work in East China over the past decade, listening to various reports from women's representatives from various regions, and formulating resolutions on the future direction of women's work in East China, the congress also formally established the East China Democratic Women's Federation. The Women's Congress elected Chen Shaomin, Li Jianzhen, Zhang Yun, Cao Yichou, Lu Cui, Qiu Yihan and other thirty-nine people as executive committee members of the East China Democratic Women's Federation. It also elected Chen Shaomin, Li Jianzhen, Qiu Yihan, Zhang Qinqiu, Wang Yuecun, Cao Haimin, Kang Ying and other fifty-six people as women's representatives from East China to attend the National Women's Congress. The congress exchanged heroic deeds and work experiences of women in rural areas, cities, the front lines, and the rear in developing production and supporting the People's Liberation War. The congress decided that the specific tasks of women's work in the East China region in the future are: to organize and lead the vast number of rural women to complete this year's agricultural production tasks in the East China region, to cultivate a large number of women labor models, and to strengthen the leadership of women's literacy classes. In the countryside, while completing the tasks of developing production and supporting the front lines, attention should be paid to appropriately relieving the immediate suffering of rural women, such as abolishing feudal systems such as arranged marriages, foot-binding, and beating women. In newly liberated areas, women should be mobilized to actively participate in the anti-feudal struggle. In cities, the work of female workers should be strengthened, and poor women should be united and educated, and the labor concept of women intellectuals should be improved.
