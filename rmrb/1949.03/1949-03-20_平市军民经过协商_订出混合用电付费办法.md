(Ping City News) Since the North China Electric Power Company's Beijing branch took over, business has been actively expanding. Recently, many users have enthusiastically come to the company to pay their bills. Regarding the payment method for mixed military and civilian electricity usage, due to the difficulty in separating the electricity costs for both parties, a provisional regulation has been established after several days of negotiation between the military and civilians: For troops stationed in civilian houses in the city who share an electricity meter with the residents, the Political Department of the 41st Army will issue "Ping City Garrison Troops Electricity Consumption Vouchers," which will specify the type and number of lights, the daily hours of electricity usage, and the number of days of electricity usage. These vouchers will be given to the users for safekeeping, and the collectors will use these vouchers to calculate the electricity bill. This method reasonably solves the difficulty of charging for mixed military and civilian electricity usage. A company employee said: "In the past, the Kuomintang troops often did not pay their bills according to regulations and even caused trouble for us. After liberation, everything is easy to handle." The masses are also very satisfied.

　　平市军民经过协商
  　订出混合用电付费办法
    【平市讯】冀北电力公司北平分公司自接管以来，业务积极展开。近日来各用户住公司交款者非常踊跃。关于军民混合用电付费办法，因双方电费难以划分，经军民多日商讨，暂行规定：凡借驻本市民房之部队与用户混合使用电表者，统由四十一军政治部印发“平警部队用电量凭单”，上开电灯种类、盏数、每日用电小时数、用电日数，交用户收执，收费员即依此凭单核计电费。这办法合理的解决了军民混合用电收费的困难。该公司职工说：“以前国民党的军队，时常不按章交费，还要找咱麻烦；解放后一切事情都好办了。”群众亦很满意。
