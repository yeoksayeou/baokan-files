　　Knowing the Law and Breaking the Law by Selling Silver Dollars
    Policeman Wang Youxiang Will Be Disciplined
    [Ping City News] Wang Youxiang, a police officer from the First Police Station of the Seventh Precinct, removed his police collar badges and hat at approximately 1:00 PM on the 18th of this month and sold silver dollars in Rou Shi Hutong outside the Front Gate. He was caught on the spot by personnel from the Northern District People's Government while engaging in illegal trading. After being taken back to the district for questioning, besides confiscating the five silver dollars, he was ordered to return to the precinct to await further handling. The district immediately informed the Seventh Precinct District Government of the matter. They believe that Wang Youxiang, as a policeman, knew the law but broke it, undermining the law. His old bad habits have not been corrected, and he will be given the punishment he deserves. (Sha Ning)
