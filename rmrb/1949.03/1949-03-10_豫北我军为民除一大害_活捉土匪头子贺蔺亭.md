Xinhua News Agency, North China, 7th -- A unit of the People's Liberation Army in northern Henan, in coordination with local armed forces and the masses, captured bandit chief He Linting, his staff officer Zhao Wangfu, and 19 others alive at Zhuangyan, southeast of Xinxiang, last month on the 23rd. They also seized ten handguns, two carbines, and three rifles. Bandit leader He Linting was a notorious bandit chief most hated by the people of northern Henan. Under the direction of the Kuomintang bandit army in Xinxiang, he engaged in robbery, looting, and the slaughter of the people, bringing disaster to over a hundred villages southeast of Xinxiang. The bandit has now been handed over to the local People's Government for legal action.

Furthermore, twenty-seven members of the Wangling Township militia stationed in Muye Village, north of Xinxiang, led by the deputy leader Feng Guo, surrendered to the People's Liberation Army on the evening of February 12th, bringing with them one light machine gun and fifteen rifles.
