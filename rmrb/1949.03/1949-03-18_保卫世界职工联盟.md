　　Defend the World Federation of Trade Unions
    Zhu Xuefan, Vice-President of the World Federation of Trade Unions

    I. American and British Labor Traitors Split the World Federation of Trade Unions

    Mr. Carey of the Congress of Industrial Organizations (CIO) of the United States and Mr. Deakin of the British Trades Union Congress (TUC) have been busy promoting the so-called Marshall Plan. This promotion was not very successful within the World Federation of Trade Unions (WFTU), and after being rebuffed, they became resentful and withdrew from the WFTU. After their withdrawal, they insisted that the Soviet trade unions had obstructed the discussion of the plan within the WFTU, using this as a pretext to split the WFTU.

    In fact, people still clearly remember that before these divisionists convened a trade union meeting in London to discuss the Marshall Plan in early March last year, behind the back of the WFTU, the Soviet trade unions had issued a warning, hoping that the plan could be submitted for discussion at the WFTU Executive Bureau meeting. However, at that time, the heads of these divisive, reactionary trade unions did not heed this warning, and now they claim that others are obstructing the discussion of the plan within the WFTU. This is clearly a conspiracy to wave the flag for U.S. imperialism, create pretexts, and undermine the unity of the world's workers.

    II. What Has the Marshall Plan Brought to the Workers of the "Assisted" Countries?

    What exactly is this Marshall Plan? Is it really, as they say, "reviving the economic foundations of European countries afflicted by disaster," or "using it to aid Europe suffering from the ravages of war?"

    We do not intend to elaborate on this "benevolent" plan here. Let's look at the situation in the countries "assisted" by the Marshall Plan.

    According to incomplete reports, in France: automobile manufacturing is restricted, aircraft factories are being reduced, and Ford cars and American aircraft are being imported in large quantities. The market is flooded with American goods, and Parker pens, glass raincoats, and American-made watches can be seen everywhere. Some factories in France have reduced production, and some have closed down, which has led more than two million French workers to unemployment and poverty. The situation in Italy is similar. Last October, Vittorio, Secretary-General of the Italian General Confederation of Labour, stated: "There are currently more than three million unemployed people in Italy, accounting for almost three out of every ten workers." Belgium is being forced to purchase manufactured textiles from the United States, while its own textile factories are working only four days a week. According to statistics from January this year, the number of unemployed has reached 300,000.

    As for Britain, this same Anglo-Saxon nation, their Labor Party government and the reactionary heads of the trade unions are so loyal to the Marshall Plan, should they not receive some special pity? However, no. After the "relief" of the Marshall Plan, the lives of ordinary British people are even harder than they were at the end of the war. According to statistics, from January to the end of August last year, prices generally rose, such as the price of textiles and shoes rose by 30%, while wages increased by only 3%. What Britain needs are mining machines, but the Marshall Plan stipulates that tobacco worth £12.3 million should be provided. Furthermore, it also stipulates that Britain must reduce its shipbuilding plan by 20%. This not only provides an outlet for the surplus broken ships of the United States; but on the other hand, it also throws 20% of British shipbuilding workers onto the streets.

    The simple statistics mentioned above are enough to explain what this "benevolent" plan will bring to the working class of various countries. Who can afford such "relief"? Thank you, Mr. Carey, Mr. Deakin, and all the salesmen. The workers really dare not welcome this treasure plan.

    III. Countries in Eastern Europe Without Marshall Plan Aid Are Gradually Recovering

    While Western Europe is trapped in the Marshall Plan and is increasingly in a state of poverty and unemployment, the lives of the Soviet people are becoming increasingly prosperous. Poland, which was destroyed and full of ruins, has also begun to be rebuilt. These countries, which were most severely destroyed in the war, do not have the "aid" of the Marshall Plan, but their lives are getting better. In the Soviet Union, according to statistics from 1947, the actual income of workers increased by 23%, the national income exceeded the pre-war level by 38%, and prices fell significantly. As a result of the price drop, the purchasing power of the ruble increased by 41%. This has further increased the actual wages of the people, and their lives have become more prosperous. The industrial production of other new democratic countries last year also far exceeded the pre-war level. According to statistics: Poland increased by 152%, Bulgaria increased by 134%, Hungary increased by 27%, and Czechoslovakia increased by 10%. Due to the increase in production and the stability of the currency, the lives of the working people have been widely improved. At the same time, due to the implementation of planned economy, unemployment has been eradicated, and the surplus labor force is rapidly being absorbed into the expanding industry.

    IV. What Benefits Have the American Worker Brothers Received?

    Imperialist countries have no morality to speak of. The Marshall Plan exchanges the growth of unemployment and famine in European countries for their high profits, which is not surprising. However, what are the reactionary trade union bosses of the CIO busy doing, tirelessly promoting the Marshall Plan, and asking workers to abandon strikes and obey the interests of the Marshall Plan? Do they think that after the capitalists earn more money, they will be merciful and give them a few more potatoes or a few more slices of bread? Last year, the American capitalists did earn a lot of money. According to the U.S. Department of Commerce, in 1948, the net profit of major companies reached a record of 21.7 billion U.S. dollars. Compared with 12.8 billion U.S. dollars in 1946, it has almost doubled (even more than before the war). However, how do they treat the workers? Their major enterprises all clearly declared at the beginning of last year that they did not intend to make any concessions to the workers. Wilson, the representative of the management of General Motors, even emphasized: "Under the current conditions, there is no reason for workers to increase wages and improve living conditions." Now, under the various oppressions of capitalist foremen, the lives of the American worker brothers have not only not improved, but have become even worse than before. According to statistics, although the nominal wages of American workers in the second half of 1948 increased by 10% compared with the same period in 1945 (excluding damage tax), due to the rise in prices, the actual wages in terms of purchasing power decreased by 20%. As for the number of unemployed, the official statistics in December last year were 2 million, and in the one and a half months from January to the first half of February this year, another one million were added.

    V. Mr. and Mrs. of the British and American Trade Unions, to What Extent Have You Fallen Today?

    Regardless of whether the Marshall Plan brings poverty and unemployment to the working class in other countries, now, even the American worker brothers themselves are suffering such a situation. However, the so-called worker leaders of the CIO and AFL in the United States still shamelessly say: "Workers should sacrifice, if it is needed for the Marshall Plan." Here, we can't help but ask: Are you gentlemen planning for the workers? Or are you planning for the Wall Street monopoly capitalists? Not only that, after these gentlemen failed to promote the Marshall Plan in the WFTU, they also proposed that the WFTU stop its activities or dissolve. Such a naked request for the WFTU to stop its activities is astonishing! Gentlemen! To what extent have you fallen today!

    VI. The World Federation of Trade Unions – The Reactionaries Want to Resolutely Destroy It, We Must Resolutely Defend It

    It is precisely because the WFTU is a powerful organization for the working class of the world to strive for their peace, democracy, unity, and higher living standards, precisely because it resolutely defends the interests of the working class of the world, precisely because it points out the facts of all enemies in front of the working class of the world and calls for continuous struggle against them, that it is envied by all reactionaries and their accomplices. As early as before the birth of the WFTU, U.S. imperialism tried its best to make it difficult to be born. Last year, it instructed the American Federation of Labor (AFL) and all the divisionists to go to London to convene a meeting. In short, it wants to use all kinds of pressure to split and weaken the WFTU. They further threatened the WFTU through figures such as Carey and Deakin, and asked it to stop its activities. This shows all the conspiracies of imperialism and also shows their fear of the international solidarity of the working class. However, their conspiracy to split the WFTU was seen through. It is precisely because of this that our working class brothers and sisters cherish this fortress of the working class even more and defend it more strongly. This time, with the support of the working class of the world, the WFTU has not been affected by the withdrawal of the British and American trade unions. On the contrary, the withdrawal of Carey and Deakin from the WFTU has been opposed by the working class of the world, including the democratic trade unions in their own countries. They are isolated, they have failed. At the same time, the Executive Committee of the WFTU, which was held in Paris, decided to hold the Second World Congress of the WFTU in Italy in June of this year, which shows that our working class organization is becoming increasingly strong. We express our heartfelt support for this unwavering decision of the leadership of the WFTU. In the future, the working class of the world will unite more closely under the banner of the WFTU and fight all reactionary forces to the end. Let us congratulate the victory of the unity of the working class of the world, and let all reactionary forces and their accomplices curse!

　　保卫世界职工联盟
    世界职工联盟副主席  朱学范
    一、美英工贼分裂世界工联
    美国产业工会联合会的加莱以及英国职工大会的狄金先生们，为着所谓的马歇尔计划而到处张罗，这种张罗在世界工联进行得不大如意，于是在碰了一回钉子之后，便羞恼成怒地退出了世界工联。在他们退出之后，便硬说苏联职工会曾阻挠把计划在世界工联中讨论，以作他们分裂世界工联的口实。
    其实，人们都还清楚的记得，去年三月初，这些分裂主义者背开世界工联，在伦敦召开讨论马歇尔计划工会会议之前，苏联职工会即曾发出劝告，希望能够将该项计划提出在世界工联执行局会议中讨论。但在当时，这些分裂主义反动工会的头子，并没有倾听这个劝告，而今天却反说别人在阻挠该计划在世界工联中讨论了，这显然是替美帝国主义摇旗呐喊制造口实，来破坏世界工人团结的阴谋。
    二、马歇尔计划给被“援助”国家的工人们带来了什么？
    马歇尔计划究竟是怎样一个宝贝呢？是不是象他们所说的一样：“复兴欧洲灾馑国家的经济基础”，或者说：“要用它来援助饱受战争灾难的欧洲”呢？
    这个“好心”的计划，在这里，我们不拟论列，我们且看被马歇尔计划“援助”后的国家是如何的情况吧。
    据不完全的报导，在法国：汽车制造受限制了，飞机工厂在缩减了，福特汽车和美国飞机则大量输入了，在市面上，则呈现了大量美货的倾销，到处都可以见到派克自来水笔，玻璃雨衣或者是美制的手表。法国的一般工厂，有的减产，有的关门，这使二百多万法国工人走上了失业和贫困的道路，意大利是同样的情形，去年十月，意大利总工会总书记维特瑞奥称：“意大利现有三百多万人失业，几乎每十个工人中就占三个”。比利时正被迫自美国购买制成的纺织品，而本国的各纺织厂，已经每周仅工作四天。据今年一月统计，失业人数已达三十万。
    至于英国这个同种的盎格鲁撒克逊民族国家，他们的工党政府、职工会反动头子又这样忠心耿耿于马歇尔计划，该应当得到一些特别的怜悯了吧？然而不然，经过马歇尔计划一番“救济”之后，英国一般平民的生活却比战争结束时候还要来得苦。据统计，自去年一月至八月底，物价普遍上涨，如纺织和鞋子价格上涨百分之三十，而工资则仅增加了百分之三。英国所需要的是开矿机器，但马歇尔计划却规定了给予价值一万二千三百万镑的烟草。并且根据规定还要英国缩减造船计划百分之二十。这不仅使美国剩余下来的破船有了出路；而且另一方面，却还使百分之二十的英国造船工人被抛在街头上。
    只是上述简简单单的统计，已经够说明这个“好心”计划会给各国工人阶级带来一些什么了。这样的“救济”，谁又承担得起？谢谢加莱、狄金以及诸位推销员先生们。这个宝贝的计划，工友们实在不敢欢迎。
    三、东欧没有马歇尔计划援助的国家都逐渐地恢复起来了
    当西欧正套在马歇尔计划而日益处于贫困和失业的灾难中，苏联人民的生活是日渐地繁荣了。被毁坏得到处是废墟的波兰，也开始建设起来。这些在战争中被毁坏最烈的国家，没有马歇尔计划的“援助”，可是，他们生活过得更好了。在苏联，据一九四七年统计，职工实际收入增加了百分之二十三，国民收入比战前超过百分之三十八，而物价则大大下降。物价下降的结果，卢布购买力提高了百分之四十一。这使人民的实际工资更形增加，生活愈益丰裕。其他新民主主义的国家，去年的工业生产亦远超过战前的水平。据统计：波兰增加了百分之一百五十二，保加利亚增加了百分之一百三十四，匈牙利增加了百分之二十七，捷克斯洛伐克增加了百分之十。由于生产的增加与货币的稳定，劳动人民的生活，已获得广泛改善。同时，更因计划经济的实施，则已根除了失业，剩余劳动力正迅速地被吸收到扩展中的工业中来了。
    四、美国的工人弟兄们又得到了些什么恩惠呢？
    帝国主义国家原就无所谓道德的，马歇尔计划以欧洲各国失业的增长与饥荒的代价，来换取他们的高额的利润，自是无足可怪。不过，产联的反动工会头子们，忙碌不休地在对马歇尔计划作辛苦的推销，并且还要工人们放弃罢工，来服从马歇尔计划的利益，究竟是为的什么？是不是想资本家将钱赚多之后，还能大发慈悲多恩赏几个马铃薯，或多赐给几片面包呢？去年，美国资本家钱确实赚得不少了。据美国商务部估计：一九四八年，各大公司纯利可达二百一十七亿美元的纪录。就和一九四六年一百二十八亿元比起来，几乎增加了一倍（比起战前更多了）。然而，他们怎样来对待工人们呢？他们的各大企业全在去年初即明白宣示，他们不打算对工人作任何的让步。通用汽车公司经理部的代表威里逊更强调说：“在现在的条件下，工人没有提高工资及改善生活待遇的理由。”现在，在资本家工头的种种压迫下，美国的工人弟兄们的生活不仅没有得到上升及改善，反比以前更苦了。据统计，一九四八年下半年，美国工人们的名义工资比起一九四五年同期虽然增加了百分之十（除损税以外），但由于物价的上涨，以购买力计算，实际工资反减少了百分之二十。而失业人数，去年十二月官方统计就有二百万，今年一月至二月上半月的一个半月内，又增加了一百万。
    五、英美工会的先生们，你们今天已经坠落到什么样的地步了？
    姑不论马歇尔计划是给其他国家的工人阶级带来贫困和失业，现在，就是连美国自己的工人弟兄们，也受到这样的境遇。而美国所谓产联、劳联的工人领袖们，却还无耻地说着：“工人们应当牺牲，如果对马歇尔计划需要的话”。这里，我们不由得问一声：你们这些先生们究竟是在为工人们作计划呢？还是为着华尔街垄断资本家作计划呢？不仅这样，这些先生们对马歇尔计划在世界工联张罗不遂之后，还提出要世界工联停止活动，或者解散的要求。这样赤裸裸地要世界工联停止活动，令人惊叹！先生们！你们今天已经坠落到什么样的地步了！
    六、世界职工联盟——反动派要坚决地破坏它，我们要坚决地保卫它
    正因为世界工联是世界工人阶级为争取他们和平、民主、团结和更高的生活水平的有力组织，正因为它坚决地保卫着世界工人阶级的利益，正因为它在世界工人阶级面前指出一切敌人的事实，而呼吁对它们作不断的斗争，所以它也就受到一切反动派以及他的同谋者的嫉视。早在世界工联诞生之前，美帝国主义便力争使它难产。去年，又指使美国劳联以及一切分裂者派去伦敦召集会议。总之，想利用一切压力来分裂和削弱世界工联。他们是进一步通过加莱狄金等人物，来威胁世界工联，而要他停止活动。这表示出一切帝国主义的阴谋，也说明了他们对于工人阶级国际团结力量的惧怕，但是，他们分裂世界工联的阴谋被看破了。也正因为此，所以我们工人阶级弟兄们对这个工人阶级的堡垒，也更加意地爱护它，更坚强地保卫它。这次世界工联在世界工人阶级的支持下，不仅没有因为英美职工会的退出而受到任何的影响，相反的，加莱和狄金的退出世联，则受到全世界工人阶级包括其本国民主工会的反对，他们孤立了，他们失败了。同时，在巴黎召开的世界工联执行委员会中，决定了本年六月在意大利召开第二届世界工联代表大会，这说明我们工人阶级的组织已日益坚强。世界工联领导上这种不动摇的决定，我们表示衷心的拥护，全世界工人阶级，今后将更加团结在世界工联旗帜下，和一切反动力量斗争到底，让我们来祝贺全世界工人阶级团结的胜利，让一切反动力量以及他的同谋者去咀咒吧！
