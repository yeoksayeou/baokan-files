Brief Replies

　　To Messrs. Yuan Zhong, Yuan Zhi, and Fu Xiao: Regarding the handling of the land occupied by your family's ancestral graves, this newspaper published it on the second page of the March 18th edition. If the family is classified as landlords, the matter should be discussed and appropriately handled by the farmers' association. If they belong to other classes, of course, the land cannot be confiscated.

　　To Mr. Zhao Minghua: Regarding your marital issue, since the Kuomintang Beiping District Court has already ruled for divorce, but without clear follow-up, you can still appeal to the People's Government, requesting reconsideration so that divorce procedures can be processed. As for the issue of damage to the dowry, it can be appropriately resolved based on the specific circumstances.

　　To Ms. Yan Yinglan: Since you and your husband have a poor relationship, and he has been working for the enemy for more than three years without any news, if you are determined to file for divorce, you can go to the local district government to process the divorce.

　　To Comrade Li Yuanbi: Regarding the issue of a poor relationship with your wife affecting your work as mentioned in your letter, we believe that if you genuinely cannot continue living together, this should not be forced. You can request the government to approve the divorce, but this should not affect your work.

　　To the Shouyang County Government Study Group: Regarding the issue of study subsidies for cadres, we have forwarded it to the North China People's Government Finance Department for handling.

　　To Mr. Shi Shuican: Your suggestions for the work in this city are very good. We have forwarded your original letter to the Municipal Government for their adoption and implementation. We hope that in the future, you will offer more suggestions for improvement regarding the things that should be promoted and reformed in this city, so that the various tasks of this city can advance by leaps and bounds, making rapid progress.

　　To Messrs. Cui Changxing and Wu Jintang: We have forwarded the questions you raised to the Xingtai County Committee. We have told them to study and resolve your problems.

　　To Mr. Sun Loli: We have forwarded your class status issue to the Quyang County Committee. If what you stated is true, it should be corrected.

　　To Mr. Du Jiuchang: Regarding your settlement issue, we have forwarded your original letter to the Jingxing County Committee. If your village truly has no land, the government should find other ways to resolve it for you.

　　To Mr. Li Tieling: Your suggestion regarding the land reform is very good. We have forwarded your original letter to the Pingshan County Government for appropriate resolution.

　　To Mr. Zhao Tonglian: Regarding your request to revise your class status, we have forwarded your original letter to the Huolu County Committee for appropriate handling.

　　To Mr. Li Liren, Ms. Yanhua: Please come to the Social Service Group of this newspaper for a discussion.
