　　Mother's Letter
    A wounded soldier, Wang Dashui, in a certain hospital on the Taiyuan front, sat up from his sickbed, opened the letter from his mother, and asked the instructor to read it to him:

    Dashui: Receiving your letter and learning that you were wounded, mother's heart is both happy and worried! Happy because you shed blood for the great cause of the people's liberation: this is the eternal glory of our Wang family, it is my glory, and it is your own glory; but I am also worried because I am so far away from your hospital, and my feet are small and I can't walk, so I can't come to see you. But then I thought: it doesn't matter, I know that our hospital takes better care of you than at home! There won't be any difficulties. Your wife heard that you were wounded, and she took out the 100,000 yuan she earned from spinning thread, and asked me to send it to you, and told me to tell you to take good care of your wounds, and when you are well, go back to the front line quickly and kill more enemies! The Kuomintang reactionaries will soon be overthrown, if you don't put in the effort now, when will you! Because the work at home and in the village is very busy, she can't come to see you either, please forgive her! Your land that we were allocated, your wife and I have discussed it! Now is the time to support the front line! We don't need the village to cultivate it for us, we can do it well ourselves, and guarantee that we will harvest a lot of grain.

    Everything is fine at home, don't worry! I hope you recover soon!

　　Mother　Tian Shi

    After the instructor finished reading Dashui's letter, applause and shouts also rang out from the surrounding beds: "What a progressive mother! Ah, Old Wang! Your wife sent money, treat us!" Everyone was excited by the letter and clamored, Comrade Wang Dashui also squinted his eyes with joy and was immersed in laughter.

　　母亲的信
    太原前线某医院，伤员王大水从病床上坐起来，拆开他母亲给他来的信，请指导员念给他听：大水：接到你的来信，知道你负了伤，娘的心中是又喜又急！喜的是你为了人民的翻身解放大事流了血：这是咱王家门上永远的光荣，是娘的光荣，也是你自己的光荣；可是我又着急的是离你们医院这么远，娘脚小走不动，不能去看看你。但是我又想：这也没什么，我知道咱们医院比家里照管的还好呢！不会有什么难处。你媳妇听说你负了伤，就拿出他纺线赚下的十万块钱，叫我给你寄去，并叫我告诉你好好养伤，好了之后再快回前线多杀敌人！国民党反动派就快被打倒啦，这时不出力气，还等什么时候呢！因家中和村中工作都很忙，她也不能看你去，叫你原谅！咱分的地，我和你媳妇商量好啦！现在正是支援前线要紧！咱们不用村里给代耕，个人努把子劲就能把它种的好好的，保证不少打粮食。
    家中一切都好，不用惦念！愿你早日恢复健康！
　　母　田氏
    指导员把大水的信念完了，四周病床上的掌声喊声也一齐响起来：“真是好进步的娘啊！啊，老王！老婆捎钱来啦，请客吧！”大家被这封信激动的吵着嚷着，王大水同志也喜的眯缝着两个眼沉浸在笑声里。
