Thirty-three KMT Generals
　　函劝蒋军流散军官　赶快登记交出枪支
    [This newspaper’s report] Thirty-three dispersed KMT military officers at the rank of general, including Lü Ruji, who have registered at the Reception Center of the Dispersed Military Personnel Handling Committee of the Beiping Garrison Political Department, recently jointly published an open letter to dispersed military personnel in Beiping, introducing their registration experience under the Communist Party's lenient policy, and advising KMT military personnel dispersed in Beiping to dispel their fears about registration and promptly go to designated locations to register. The letter stated: "We are all dispersed KMT generals residing in Districts 1, 3, 5, 6, 7, and Outer District 3 of the city. On the afternoon of February 23rd at 2 PM, we all gathered at the Fangjia Hutong Dispersed Military Personnel Reception Center one after another. After completing the registration procedures in accordance with the regulations, we all returned to our homes that evening. We specifically inform you and ask you to tell all your former military colleagues to quickly go to the designated locations to register. If you have any firearms or weapons, you must hand them over quickly. For the sake of your own future, please do not continue to wait and see or doubt, as that is merely foolish worrying." The letter was signed by: Lü Ruji, Xing Shutian, Chen Wenhong, Cao Jiwu, Guo Xipu, Wang Laqing, Chen Peiran, Yi Wenshen, and thirty others.
