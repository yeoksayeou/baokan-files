　　Everything for the Comfort of the Wounded and Sick
  　A Record of the Work of the Frontline Hospital on the Western Front

    During the Taiyuan Campaign, the Second, Fifth, and Sixth Mobile Hospitals, the Fifth Rear Hospital, and the Station Hospital on the western front, launched a fervent emulation campaign under the slogan "Everything for the comfort and satisfaction of the wounded and sick." They deeply understand, as Minister Qian said: "A hospital is not only a treatment facility, but also has an important significance in cultivating the fighting backbone of the troops (because a soldier gains more combat experience with each injury), and in making the hospital the most noble class family for the wounded and sick to recuperate." Therefore, the hospital staff forgot all the hardships and difficulties in their work, and only thought about "how to better ensure the comfort and satisfaction of the wounded and sick" all day long. They showed boundless love and loyalty to the wounded and sick.
    The frontline hospitals faced many difficulties. First, they were in a combat environment. The hospital had to frequently move its location or change its tasks according to changes in the battle situation. Sometimes, they had just tidied up the house when they received an order to leave immediately. However, all hospital staff agreed that they were not annoyed by these moves. Once, the fourth unit of the Station Hospital received the task of taking in 600 seriously wounded soldiers. Because the situation at the front was uncertain, everyone put up and took down the beds again and again, working for three days and three nights to make more than 1,000 beds. All comrades not only had no complaints, but also actively tried to make the ward even better.
    "If we move our hands a little more, the wounded will suffer a little less." Therefore, they relied on enthusiasm and effort to create many valuable methods to improve the hospital environment and reduce the suffering of the wounded and sick. For example, in the countryside, it is not easy to ensure that the wounded and sick can take a bath once or twice a week. The sixth unit of the Fifth Mobile Hospital and the first unit of the Station Hospital used the broken bricks and lime of the blockhouse, plus their own labor, to build a bathhouse. Each person also took time to cut some yellow artemisia to boil water every day, so that the patients could take a bath. The fifty or sixty scabies patients in the sixth unit could take a bath twice a week, and the more than one hundred and fifty staff and patients in the first unit could take a bath once a week. Of course, the patients were satisfied. Also, in order to make the wounded sleep well, a layer of dry grass was placed under the beds (an average of ten catties per person in the ninth unit of the Fifth Mobile Hospital), and then covered with straw mats, straw bags, and cotton quilts, which were thick and soft. But all this grass was cut by the staff or lightly wounded soldiers themselves. According to incomplete statistics from the Fifth Mobile Hospital headquarters, the sixth unit, and the ninth unit, more than 130,000 catties of artemisia grass were cut during the Taiyuan Campaign. Generally speaking, the kitchen staff is the busiest, but the Sixth Mobile Hospital cut the most. Comrade Wang Youcai, a nurse, cut more than 130 catties of grass a day while sick. Their slogan was: "Lay it thick, sleep warm, we feel at ease when the wounded are comfortable." In addition, the third cooking team of the first unit of the Fifth Rear Hospital, despite their busy schedule, did not feel tired and squeezed out time to break up pig bones and boil oil to improve the diet of the wounded and sick, boiling more than 60 catties of oil in more than a month. The staff of the ninth and sixth units of the Fifth Mobile Hospital took time to wash more than 920 pieces of clothing for the wounded during the Taiyuan Campaign.
    In terms of medical care, the medical staff of each hospital were equally patient. For example, Comrade Kong Shengchun of the Station Hospital took care of 20 seriously wounded soldiers, and did not rest well for seven days and seven nights, injecting as much as 11,000 CC of saline solution in one day. Under the personal supervision of Deans Ou and Zeng, the surgical team of the Sixth Mobile Hospital performed surgery on 132 people in thirteen days, and went deep into the wards after the surgery to care about changes in the condition. Once, Vice Dean Zeng entered the ward in the morning and did not have breakfast until 2:00 pm.
    The hospital staff's high degree of love for the wounded is even more manifested in extreme tension, and meticulous care for the wounded and sick, just as the challenge book from the first branch of the Sixth Mobile Hospital to the third branch stipulates: "All staff members must ensure a high degree of understanding of the pain of the wounded and sick, understand the feelings of the severely wounded, and provide more attentive care to the wounded who cannot speak."
    When the wounded and sick are admitted to the Station Hospital, the head of the cooking team and the head of the nursing team organize a comfort group to go deep into the wards to comfort the wounded as soon as they arrive. On the one hand, they learn about the patient's condition, ideological situation, and solicit opinions. On the other hand, they introduce the hospital's situation and relevant systems and regulations to enhance mutual feelings. In order to more subtly understand the feelings of the wounded, the nurses go to the wards to talk with the wounded, asking them to talk about their painful experiences and ideological situation since being injured, and improve their nursing work based on these.
    Because the hospital staff are actively responsible for caring for the wounded and sick, the wounded and sick are very moved, so they automatically think of many ways to reduce the workload of the staff, such as organizing recuperation committees, ideological mutual aid groups, outing mutual aid groups, family committees, contribution mutual aid groups, mutual aid groups for lightly and seriously wounded, cultural and entertainment mutual aid groups, etc. to help each other, educate each other, and further achieve self-management. In this way, the wounded and staff are truly closely united and work together to forge ahead, and everyone tries to improve their hospital. Comrade Zhou Yaohan, a nurse at the Sixth Mobile Hospital, patiently and thoughtfully cared for 20 seriously wounded soldiers, and often comforted them: "You were injured at the front, and we will definitely take good care of you." The wounded said: "You are very good to me, and I will definitely fight well when I return to the front." The wounded at the rear hospital automatically presented flags and flowers to the comrades of the third cooking team. A staff member of the sixth unit of the Fifth Mobile Hospital has been commended as many as 19 times since the Taiyuan Campaign.

　　一切为了伤病员舒服
  　记西线前方医院工作
    梅岭
    在太原战役中，西线第二、五、六机动医院，第五后方医院和兵站医院，在“一切为了伤病员舒服满意”的号召下，展开了热烈的立功竞赛运动。他们深知，正象钱部长所说：“医院不仅是个治疗机关，还有个重要的意义，就是培养部队的战斗骨干（因为一个战士负一次伤就多一次战斗经验），并使成为伤病员休养的最高尚的阶级家庭。”因此，医院工作人员，在工作中忘掉了一切艰苦困难，成天只盘算着“如何才能更好的使伤病员舒服满意。”对伤病员表现了无限热爱与忠诚。
    前方医院的困难是很多的，首先是处在战斗环境，医院必须跟着战斗情况的变化而时常转移驻地或改变任务，有时房子刚收拾好，接到命令马上就得走，但是全体医院工作同意，对这些往返，毫不厌烦。一次，兵站医院第四所，接到任务：收重伤员六百名。因前方情况不定，大家刚把床位搭上又拆，拆了又搭，整整忙了三天三夜，共做床位达一千余个，全体同志，不仅毫无怨言，反而进一步的积极设法，去把病房收拾得更好。
    “咱们多动一下手，伤员少受一点罪。”因此，他们依靠热情与努力，创造了许多宝贵的办法，改进医院的环境，减少伤病员的痛苦。比如在农村里，要做到伤病员每星期洗一、二次澡，是不容易的。机动五院六所和兵站医院一所，就利用炮台的破砖。青灰加上自家的劳动，建造起澡塘来。每人每天再抽空割些黄蒿烧水，病号就可以洗澡了。六所五六十个疥号，每星期每人能洗澡两次，一所工作人员病员兵一百五十余人，能每星期洗澡一次，病号当然满意。又如为了使伤员睡的好，在床位底下都垫一层干草（机动五院九所每人平均十斤），再铺上草帘、草包、棉被，又厚又软。但这些草，都是工作人员或轻伤员自己割来的。据机动五院院部、六所、九所的不完全统计，在太原战役中所割的蒿草，即达十三万多斤。一般的说炊事班工作最忙，但是六机动医院，数他们割的多。护士王有才同志带着病，一天割草一百三十余斤，他们的口号是：“铺的厚，睡的暖，伤员舒服咱心安。”另外，后方五院一所炊事第三班，在百忙中还不顾疲劳，挤出时间，把猪骨头打碎熬油，来改善伤病员伙食，一个多月中，熬油达六十斤之多。机动五院九所六所工作人员在太原战役中抽空为伤员洗衣服达九百二十多件。
    在医疗上，各医院医务人员同样是十分耐心的。如兵站医院孔胜春同志，一个人护理二十个重伤员，七天七夜没有好好休息，一天之中，注射食盐水达一万一千ＣＣ之多。机动六院手术组，在欧、曾院长亲自主持下，十三天做了一百三十二个人的手术，并且手术后深入病房，关心伤情变化。曾副院长有一次，早晨进到病房，直至下午二点钟，还没有吃早饭。
    医院工作人员的高度对伤员的热爱更表现在极度的紧张中，对伤病员的体贴入微，正象机动六院一分院给三分院的挑战书中规定：“全体工作人员，保证做到高度体贴伤病员的痛苦，理解特重伤员的心情，对不能说话的伤员护理更要周到。”
    兵站医院在伤病员的入院时，并由炊事班长，护士班长等组织慰问组，伤员一来，即深入病房慰问，一方面了解伤员病状，思想情况、征求意见，另一方面，介绍医院情形和有关制度及规定，以互相增进感情。护士同志，为了更细微体贴伤员的心情，到病房去与伤员座谈，要求伤员讲自己负伤以来的痛苦经过与思想情形，并根据这些来改进自己的护理工作。
    由于医院工作人员积极负责的爱护伤病员，使伤病员非常感动，因而他们自动地想很多办法，来减轻工作人员的工作，如组织休养委员会、思想互助组、外出互助组、家属委员会、投稿互助组、轻重伤员互助组、文化娱乐互助组等以互相帮助，互相教育，并进而做到自己管理自己。这样伤员与工作人员真正亲密的团结起来，共同奋力前进，大家设法把自己的医院搞好。机动六院护士周摇汉同志，护理二十个重伤员，耐心周到，并经常向他们安慰：“你们在前方受了伤，我们一定好好照顾你。”伤员说：“你们对我很好，回前方一定好好打仗。”后方医院的伤员自动给炊事第三班同志献旗带花。机动五院六所某工作人员，自太原战役以来，被表扬即达十九次之多。
