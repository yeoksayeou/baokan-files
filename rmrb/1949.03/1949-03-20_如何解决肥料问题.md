How to Solve the Fertilizer Problem
    Tian Huonong, Lin Ning

    This year, the North China region is required to increase grain production by 7.5 million shi over last year, increase cotton production by 130 million jin (excluding Jidong figures), and also greatly increase oilseed production. It is also required to generally restore pre-war production levels within three years. One of the important links to accomplish this task is to increase fertilizer.

    Farmers are very clear: "Planting land without manure is just messing around," "With enough manure and diligent watering, you don't need to ask anyone." As Lu Defa from Ding County said: "My land is fertilized with ten cartloads of manure per mu, yielding one shi and two dou of grain. The neighbor's land is the same as mine, but fertilized with five cartloads of manure per mu, yielding only seven dou of grain; one more cartload of manure yields one more dou of grain." Liu Runtian from Wangdu said: "One more load of manure will definitely yield half a sheng more grain."

    Obviously, the amount of fertilizer applied is an important factor affecting yield, and it has a significant impact in the current year. According to many surveys, the largest decrease compared to pre-war levels in rural North China is in fertilizer, a reduction of about 25% to 50%.

    According to a survey of four villages in Yuping (Yu County and Pingding Joint County), in 1944, pen manure decreased by 9.5% compared to 1937, green manure increased by 26%, human waste was equal, oil cake decreased by 25%, black beans decreased by 25%, and asphalt decreased by 50%. Furthermore, according to a survey of nine villages in five counties, Fanshi, Shanyin, Hunyuan, Lingqiu, and Yingxian, sheep manure in 1944 decreased by 71% compared to pre-war levels. The fertilizer situation in mountainous areas is still similar to the above survey today, and some villages even have unfertilized barren land. As for the fertilizer situation in the plains, according to a 1948 survey, the proportion of green manure, kang soil, and smoked fertilizer increased significantly. Livestock manure decreased by about half compared to pre-war levels, and oil cake and human waste were greatly reduced.

    The reasons for the reduction in fertilizer: (1) The number of draft animals has decreased by about half, sheep flocks have decreased by about 80%, and pigs have also greatly decreased compared to pre-war levels. This is the fundamental reason for the reduction in fertilizer. (2) The lack of labor has led to a decrease in the accumulation and production of fertilizer. Fertilizer from towns and cities cannot be fully transported to rural areas for use. (3) The lack of fuel. Because transportation is inconvenient and coal transportation is difficult, sorghum stalks and weeds are all used as fuel and cannot be used to line pens and make compost. (4) The reduction in oilseed crops. For example, cottonseed, peanuts, and rapeseed have all decreased compared to pre-war levels, so there is a shortage of oil cake. (5) Farmers still have difficulties in expanding reproduction. As for the increase in the proportion of green manure, kang soil, and smoked fertilizer, it is the result of the organization and leadership of Party and government at all levels and farmers' associations in the liberated areas, which have been improved and promoted on the basis of the masses' old practices.

    In order to complete the task of increasing production, the Agricultural and Forestry Conference requires that fertilizer be increased by 15% to 20% this year compared to last year. Increasing fertilizer is a universal and large-scale task that every household must complete. It is a powerful guarantee for increasing production, and the leadership must pay special attention to mobilizing the masses to implement it. The methods of accumulating fertilizer can be divided into the following types:

    1. Develop animal husbandry: In the plains, focus on raising pigs. Areas with a good foundation require one pig per household, areas with a poorer foundation require one pig per two households, and even the worst areas must achieve one pig per ten households. It is required that "there are pigs if there are pens, and there are pens if there are pigs." Currently, piglets are scarce and expensive. The leadership must support the development of sows to breed piglets. At the same time, pig cholera serum must be promoted to reduce pig losses. Local trade departments and cooperatives must be responsible for promoting the sale of bristles to increase income from pig raising. It is advocated to feed the oil cake used for fertilizing fields to pigs first, and then use the pig's manure as fertilizer. This is almost as effective as directly using oil cake to fertilize fields and can achieve two goals at once. Establishing pig pens requires concrete solutions to various difficulties and in-depth publicity. A pig pen can produce more than 100 large cartloads of manure a year, fertilizing 20 mu of land. If the pig pen is connected to the latrine, even more fertilizer can be produced. Pens can prevent the spread of swine fever and avoid damage to crops. Some villages have made public agreements: households without pigs should dig a manure pit (a common practice in many places in southern Hebei) and pour garbage, dirty water, and weeds into the pit. One or two dozen large cartloads of fertilizer can be produced in a year, which is also a way to solve the fertilizer problem.

    In mountainous areas, focus on developing sheep flocks. This year, it is required to increase by one-third (and strive to develop pigs as well), and organize sheep to lie on the ground. To develop sheep flocks, it is necessary to solve the sales problem of hides, wool, and down, prevent the spread of anthrax (serum is already available for use in various places), and improve sheep-raising techniques.

    2. Widely promote green manure and smoked fertilizer. In many mountainous areas, these fertilizers account for 50%. This year, green manure should be promoted during the dog days of summer, and smoked fertilizer should be developed in autumn and spring (a common practice in Taihang, Taiyue, and western Hebei). In some places, soil blocks are placed in the stove pit and changed every three or four days. This has the same effect as smoked soil. In the plains, where firewood is scarce, state-owned stores, county cooperatives, or production promotion agencies should organize coal stations, and transportation departments should also help solve the problem of coal burning for the masses, so that weeds and sorghum stalks can be used as fertilizer. In waterlogged areas where there is a lot of grass but no habit of fertilizing, it is necessary to encourage cutting grass for fertilizer. In areas with wheat fields, it is advocated to plant black beans or mung beans, sowing one sheng of beans per mu. When the bean seedlings bloom, the bean seedlings are pressed into the ground, and when they rot by the time of wheat planting, they can become excellent fertilizer, which is equivalent to 3,000 jin of pen manure, and requires very little labor and capital. The masses in colder regions believe that green manure does not rot and has little effect. This is incorrect. Fertilizer pressed into the ground during the dog days of the previous year can rot and be used in the second year. If there is lime, pouring some lime water on the green manure will make it rot faster. Green manure has a great effect: it can increase fertilizer efficiency, improve soil, and retain moisture to resist drought.

    3. Make adobe bricks to exchange for kang soil and scrape old wall plaster. This is a common practice in most areas and should continue to be promoted.

    4. Develop silt deposition and mud digging. In areas along rivers or in earthen mountain areas (such as southern Chahar), floodwaters can be used for silt deposition; in plain areas near waterlogged areas and villages with water pits, mud can be dug for fertilizer, which is very fertile. In many other places, it is possible to encourage digging pits (or setting up livestock latrines) along village roadsides to accumulate water and silt.

    5. Combine with sanitation. Organize manure yards in towns and cities, sweep streets and courtyards in rural areas, diligently collect manure, diligently line pens, and utilize bran, straw, chicken feathers, chicken manure, hair, animal hooves, goose manure, blood from slaughterhouses, or collect the seeds of stinky trees, locust trees, and forest banyan trees as fertilizer. Although these are scattered, they can solve considerable problems by accumulating small amounts. Some places believe that using chicken manure will produce grubs (black-headed worms), so they dare not use it as fertilizer. According to the experience of old farmers, pouring boiling water on chicken manure can prevent the occurrence of grubs. This method can be promoted. Furthermore, chicken feathers, hair, and animal hooves can be soaked in water for a few days, preferably with some lime added to make them rot into excellent fertilizer, or they can be used directly as base fertilizer without soaking, which is also very effective.

    6. Encourage the planting of yellow and black beans (which can be intercropped with sorghum and corn) so that farmers have beans to exchange for oil cake or use beans directly on the land. Promote rational crop rotation (adjust planting), and fully utilize the land's fertility.

    7. Promote bringing in outside soil to build embankments. As the saying goes, "Soil for soil brings ten shi." Putting some sand on sticky soil and alkaline land, and adding some black and red soil to white soil can improve the soil. On the other hand, encourage building embankments to avoid soil erosion, and also to deposit new soil, conserve rainwater, and increase land fertility.

    8. Purchase and promote chemical fertilizers (ammonium sulfate and phosphate lime). Before the war, the custom of using chemical fertilizers was common in irrigated areas along the Pinghan Railway, and the effect was very good. There are still about 500,000 jin of phosphate lime in central and southern Hebei this year, which must be fully utilized. According to the experiment of the Beiyue Quyang Farm, mixing one part of phosphate fertilizer with two parts of cottonseed cake and applying 80 jin per mu twice to the wheat stubble eight-one-one valley can yield four shi of grain per mu. Applying 60 jin of mixed fertilizer to one valley along the wheat stubble can yield two shi and two dou of grain per mu, with full grains and very few shriveled grains. Beipinggu Village in Ding County once used Bennett's fertilizer powder, applying about 15 jin per mu, which is equivalent to three shi of black beans or seven cartloads of straw manure, but it is not as long-lasting as black beans. Zhengding Wanminzhuang also used chemical fertilizers, applying 25 jin per mu, and the effect was very great, and it saved manpower and animal power, but it required more watering. Many farmers believe that the use of fertilizer powder needs to be increased year by year, and some people say: "Using fertilizer powder is bad for the land, like a person taking morphine shots." But this shortcoming can be overcome by mixing fertilizer powder with other fertilizers (but not with plant ash) and applying it in two or three applications. This can overcome the problem of fertilizer efficiency disappearing easily, being short-lived, and being bad for the land.

    Generally speaking, North China's soil is most deficient in nitrogen, and phosphorus is also quite deficient, so the use of ammonium sulfate and phosphate lime is very necessary; at the same time, bone meal should also be promoted. Bone meal is manufactured in Tianjin, Shijiazhuang, and Xingtang. According to farmers' use, it is more effective than oil cake and cheaper. Bone meal is a slow-release fertilizer and can be used as base fertilizer. If it is used as top dressing, it must be fermented first (that is, added with water to make black mud), and then applied green, requiring about 60 jin per mu. Bone meal has a simple composition and also needs to be mixed with other fertilizers for application.

    9. Promote black alum (ferrous sulfate) and brine as fertilizers in suitable areas. These are both stimulating fertilizers. Black alum is produced in Pingding Guangling, Wutai, and other places. The masses in this area are accustomed to using it, and the effect is very good, and it can also improve alkaline land. According to a survey in Pingding: mixing black alum, kang soil, and manure and applying it to grain and corn fields can prevent mole crickets, black-headed worms, and badgers. Use 20 to 30 jin per mu of dry land, and more for paddy land. The same land using black alum can produce more than three dou of grain per mu, and it is cheap. But black alum is not suitable for planting melons, radishes, onions, and cabbage. The disadvantage is that land is not drought-resistant after using black alum. Brine is suitable for black clay land or vegetable gardens and works well, about 30 jin per mu, but it should not be used continuously for many years, otherwise the land will easily become alkaline.

    10. Advocate separate storage of plant ash (small ash) and human waste to avoid loss of fertilizer efficiency. It is necessary to add more soil to the latrine, especially in the areas of southern Chahar and northern Yanbei. In central and southern Hebei along the Grand Canal, alkaline areas do not use human urine because they believe that the land becomes more alkaline after using urine, which is not correct. Using urine as fertilizer only has benefits and no harm. In terms of fertilization methods, it is advisable to promote manure placement in nests (manure in pits), manure drills (seed manure), and reduce the use of "spreading manure all over." For crops such as wheat, corn, sorghum, millet, and cotton, in addition to applying base fertilizer, it is advocated to apply top dressing (supplemental fertilizer) to overcome the phenomenon of crops being strong first and then weak.

    In order to effectively increase fertilizer, the leadership must specifically organize and support the restoration and expansion of oil mills and flour mills, purchase oil cake, fertilizer powder, black alum, etc. for sale or loan to farmers. County cooperatives and production promotion agencies must work hard to complete this task and organize and lead the masses to create a fertilizer production and accumulation movement. Especially in spring, seize the time to transport soil, smoke manure, build pig pens, build dikes, bring in outside soil, and combine with the development of spring sanitation. Organize farmers around cities to transport manure, urine, and dirty soil to the cities. Call on farmers to take advantage of the lower oil cake prices and higher grain prices to exchange grain for oil cake. In areas lacking the habit of fertilization (Anping, Raoyang often flooded areas, and northern Chahar), persuade the masses to fertilize and adopt effective measures to promote fertilizer accumulation, such as the Ningnan County Production Promotion Agency, which set up two manure yards to buy the manure from the masses and then lend it to the farmers. This has driven the masses to pick up manure and fertilize. These are all tasks that must be seized and completed this spring, and only by completing these tasks can this year's production increase be guaranteed.

　　如何解决肥料问题
    田活农　林宁
    华北区今年要求较去年增产食粮七百五十万石，增产棉花一亿三千万斤（未包括冀东数字），油料亦需大量增产，并要求三年内普遍恢复战前生产水平。完成这个任务的重要环节之一是增加肥料。
    农民都很清楚：“种地不上粪，就是瞎胡混”，“粪大水勤不用问人。”正如定县的路德法说：“我的地每亩上十车粪，打一石二斗粮，地邻的地和我的一样，每亩上五车粪，只打七斗粮；多上一车粪，就多打一斗粮。”望都的刘润田说：“多上一驮粪，准能多打升半粮。”
    显然，施肥多少是影响产量的重要因素，而且当年即有很显著的表现。据许多调查，华北农村各项耕作中较战前降低最多的是肥料，约减少百分之二十五至百分之五十。
    据盂平（盂县平定联合县）四个村调查一九四四年较一九三七年圈肥减少百分之九点五，绿肥增加百分之二十六，人粪尿相等，油饼减百分之二十五，黑豆减百分之二十五，柏油减少百分之五十。又据繁峙、山阴、浑源、灵邱、应县五县九个村调查，一九四四年羊粪较战前减少百分之七十一，山岳地区的肥料情况，直到今天仍与上述调查相仿，甚至有的村还有不上粪的白地。至于平原地区的肥料情况据一九四八年调查在比重上升的主要是绿肥，炕土和熏肥，牲口屎尿较战前减少约一半，油饼和黑豆人粪均大为减少。
    肥料减少的原因：（一）耕畜减少约二分之一，羊群减少约百分之八十，猪较战前亦大减，这是肥料减少的基本原因。（二）劳力缺少，积肥造肥随之减少，城镇肥料亦不能充分运到农村使用。（三）燃料缺乏。因为交通不便，煤炭运输困难，秫秸杂草均用去作了燃料，不能用以垫圈沤肥。（四）油料作物减少。如棉籽、花生、菜子等均较战前减少，故油饼缺乏。（五）农民扩大再生产尚有困难。至于绿肥、炕土、熏肥在比重上所以增加，是由于解放区各级党和政府、农会的组织领导，在群众旧有的基础上加以提高和推广的结果。
    为了完成增产，农林会议要求今年在去年的基础上增加肥料百分之十五至百分之二十。增加肥料是要家家户户普遍大量完成的工作，它是增产的有力保证，领导上要特别注意发动群众去实行。至于积肥的方法可分为如下几种：
    一、发展畜养：平原着重养猪，有基础地区要求一户一猪，基础较差地区要求二户一猪，最差地区也须作到十户一猪，要求“有猪有圈，有圈有猪”。现在小猪缺少，价昂，领导上要扶助发展母猪，繁殖小猪，同时要推广猪瘟血清，减少猪的损失，各地贸易部门合作社要负责推销毛鬃，增加养猪的收入，提倡把肥田用的油饼先喂猪，再利用猪的粪尿作肥料，这样与直接用油饼肥田效力差不多，可一举两得。建立猪圈要具体解决各种困难，深入宣传。一个猪圈一年可出粪一百大车以上，肥田廿亩，如果猪圈与茅厕联在一起，则造肥更多。圈可防止猪瘟传染，避免损失庄稼。有的村庄订出公约：无猪者一家挖一个粪坑（冀南不少地方有这个习惯）将垃圾脏水杂草倒入坑中，一年可造肥一、二十大车，亦是解决肥料的办法。
    山地要着重发展羊群，今年要求发展三分之一（猪也力求发展），组织羊卧地。发展羊群，要解决皮毛绒的销售问题，防止羊炭疸病的传染（已有血清可供各地使用），提高养羊技术。
    二、广泛提倡压绿肥及熏肥，许多山地这种肥料占百分之五十，今年伏天要开展压绿肥，在秋后及春季发展熏肥（在太行、太岳、平西均有此习惯），有些地方在灶坑中放土块，每隔三、四天换一次土。这和熏土是一样的作用。平原地区烧柴困难，各公营商店、县联社或生产推进社，要组织煤站，交通部门也要协助共同解决群众烧煤的困难。使杂草秫秸用作肥料。水淀地区草多，无压肥习惯，要提倡割草压肥。有留麦田地区，提倡种黑豆或绿豆，每亩播种一升豆子，待豆苗开花时，将豆苗压地中，至种麦时腐烂可成为极好的肥料，可顶三千斤圈肥，而且所费劳力资本极少。比较寒冷地区的群众认为绿肥烂不了，作用不大，这是不对的，头年伏天压的肥到第二年用，是可以腐烂的。如有石灰，在绿肥上泼些石灰水则腐烂更快。绿肥的作用是很大的：可增加肥效，改良土壤，保持水分耐旱等。
    三、打坯换炕，刮老墙皮。一般地区多有此习惯，今后仍需提倡推广。
    四、发展放淤挖淤泥。沿河地区或土山地区（如察南）可利用洪水放淤；靠近水淀地区及村边有水坑的平原地区均如此挖淤泥作肥料，是很肥沃的。尚有许多地方村边道旁可提倡挖坑（或设牲口茅坑）积水淤泥。
    五、与卫生相结合。在城镇组织粪场，在农村中打扫街院，勤拾粪，勤垫圈，利用糠皮秸秆、鸡毛、鸡粪、头发牲口蹄、雁粪、屠宰坊的血水，或采集臭椿、槐树、林榔树的种籽作肥料，这些虽零散，但积少成多，也能解决相当的问题。有些地方认为上鸡粪生蛴螬（黑头虫），因之不敢用作肥料。据老农的经验；用开水泼鸡粪，即可防止蛴螬的发生，这个办法可以推广。再就是鸡毛、头发、牲口蹄用水泡几天，最好加些石灰使其腐烂即变成极好肥料，或不泡直接作底粪也很有效。
    六、提倡多种黄黑豆（可与高粱玉蜀黍间作），使农家有豆子换油饼，或用豆子直接上地。提倡合理的轮作（调槎），充分利用地力。
    七、提倡客土垒埝。农谚云：“土换土，打石五”，黏土地碱地上些砂子，白土地垫些黑红土，均可改良土壤。另方面提倡垒埝，以免沃土冲刷，又可淤新土，保存雨水，增加地力。
    八、采购与推广化学肥料（硫酸ｙà＠①与磷酸石灰）。战前在平汉沿线的水浇地，多有使用化学肥料的习惯，效果颇佳，现在冀中、冀南尚存磷酸石灰约五十万斤，今年要充分利用，据北岳曲阳农场试验，用磷肥一份与棉籽饼二份混合，每亩施八十斤，分二次用于麦槎的八一一谷，一亩可收谷四石。用混合肥料六十斤上于麦槎边一谷。每亩可收谷二石二斗，籽粒丰满，秕子很少。定县北平谷村曾用过卜内门肥田粉，每亩施十五斤左右，可顶三市斗黑豆或七车草粪，不过不如黑豆有后劲。正定完民庄也曾用过化学肥料，每亩用二十五斤，效果很大，且省人力畜力，但需多浇水。许多农民认为用肥田粉，需连年递增，且有的人说：“用肥田粉坏地，好象人打吗啡针一样”。但这缺点是可以克服的，其办法是：使用肥田粉必须混合其他肥料（但不要与草木灰混合），分二、三次施用，即可克服肥效容易消失无后劲、坏地的毛病。
    华北土壤一般的说，氮素最缺，磷质也相当缺少，故使用硫酸＠、磷酸石灰是很必要的；同时骨粉也要提倡使用。骨粉在天津、石家庄、行唐均有制造，据农民使用，效力较油饼大，且便宜。骨粉是迟效肥料，可作底肥，如用作追肥须先＠酵（即加水沤成黑泥），再抓青，每亩均需用六十斤左右。骨粉成份单纯，亦需与其他肥料混合施用。
    九、在适宜地区推广黑矾（硫酸低铁），卤作肥料，这两种均属于刺激性肥料，黑矾在平定广灵、五台等地均有出产，这一带群众均有使用习惯，效果很好，又可改良碱地。据平定调查：将黑矾、炕土、大粪混合施于谷地、玉茭地，可防蝼蛄黑头虫及獾，每亩旱地用二、三十斤，水地可多些；同样的地用黑矾者，每亩地可多产粮三斗多，且价廉。但黑矾不适于种瓜、萝＠、葱、洋白菜。用黑矾后地不耐旱这是缺点。卤适于黑黏土地或菜园，效果不错，每亩用三十斤左右，但不宜连年使用，否则地易犯碱。
    十、提倡草木灰（小灰）与人粪尿分开保存，以免肥效消失。茅厕多垫些土是必要的，特别是察南雁北地区。冀中、冀南沿运河碱性地区不用人尿，认为用尿后地更碱，这是不对的。用尿作肥料只有好处没有坏处。在施肥方法上宜提倡粪抓窝（使坑粪），粪耩（籽粪），少用“遍上粪”的办法。小麦、玉蜀黍、高粱、谷子、棉花等作物，除施底肥外，提倡再上追肥（补肥），克服庄稼先壮后弱的现象。
    为了使肥料切实增加，领导上要具体组织扶助油房粉房的恢复与扩大，采购油饼、肥川粉、黑矾等出卖或贷给农民。各县联社，生产推进社必须用大力完成，并组织领导群众造成造肥积肥运动，特别在春季要抓紧时间运土、熏粪、垒猪圈、垒地堰、客土，与开展春季卫生相结合组织城市周围农民到城市运粪尿、脏土，号召农民趁此油饼较贱粮价较高时，以粮换油饼。缺乏施肥习惯地区（安平、饶阳常泛滥区及察北等地），应说服群众施肥，并采用有效办法促使群众积肥，如宁南县生产推进社，设两个粪场，收买群众的粪，再贷给农民。因而带动了群众拾粪施肥。这些都是今春必须抓紧完成的工作，也只有完成了这些工作，今年增产才有保证。
