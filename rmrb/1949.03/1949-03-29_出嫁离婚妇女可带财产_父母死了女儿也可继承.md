　　Married and Divorced Women Can Take Property; Daughters Can Also Inherit When Parents Die
To the Editors:
　　Regarding the issue of women's inheritance rights in the land reform, I have a question that I would like answered.
　　(1) Do women still have inheritance rights? How should women enjoy the property rights they obtain in their husband's or parents' homes during the land reform? For example: A widow has only one daughter who is already married. During this land reform, the daughter negotiated with her son-in-law to register the daughter's name in her mother's household. The daughter received her due share of property in her mother's home, and the husband's family registered one less person, receiving one less person's share of land. If this widow passes away, will her remaining property be inherited by her daughter? Or will the daughter only be allowed to receive half, with the mother's half being confiscated or taken over by close relatives?
　　(2) During the land reform, unmarried girls have property allocated to them in their parents' home. If the girl wants to sell or take away her share of the property when she gets married, do her parents, brothers, and sisters-in-law have the right to stop her? If she is allowed to take it away, and her parents have more children or add more people to the family, where will the land for these new people come from?
　　Also, if a husband and wife have met the conditions for divorce, does the woman have the right to take away her due share of property? (Shen Quanquan and Dong Jin, Fourth District, Huolu)
　　Comrades Quanquan and Dong Jin: We have asked the North China People's Government's Ministry of Justice to answer your questions regarding the distribution of property to women after the land reform as follows:
　　(1) A married woman who has been included in her parents' household during the land reform, and has received property, should manage it jointly with her widowed mother. After her mother's death, it should be inherited by the daughter. Close relatives cannot inherit it. The names of both mother and daughter should be written on the land certificate.
　　(2) After the peasants have equally divided the land and property of the landlord class based on population, they should form individual economies based on households, which should be regarded as jointly owned and jointly operated and developed. After the land has been equally divided, the land will not be moved when the population increases. The only way to solve this is to increase production so that people who have not been allocated land can also increase their income from production. Everyone has a right to a share of the property. A girl is allowed to take away her share of the land when she gets married or divorced, and no one else is allowed to interfere.

### 出嫁离婚妇女可带财产　父母死了女儿也可继承

　　出嫁离婚妇女可带财产　父母死了女儿也可继承编者同志：
    关于土地改革中，女子继承权问题，有一点疑问请求答复。
    （一）女子是否还有继承权？土地改革中妇女在婆家或娘家取得的财产权应如何享受？例如：一个寡妇只有一个女儿，已经出嫁，这次土地改革中，女儿同其女婿商洽，把女儿名字造在了娘家，女儿在娘家分得了应有的财产，婆家少造了一口人，少分了一个人的土地。如果此寡妇下世后，其遗留财产，由其女儿继承呢？还是只许其女儿分一半，其母那一半充公处理，或由本族近属接受。
    （二）土地改革中未出嫁的女孩，财产分在了娘家，如果女孩出嫁时，主张把自己分得的一份财产出卖，或带走，其父母兄嫂是否有权阻拦？如果允许带走，其父母又生下子女或添了人口，这新添的人口土地从那来呢？
    另外，如果夫妻双方已构成了离婚条件，妇女是否有权将其应得的一份财产带走。（获鹿四区沈全全、东金）
    全全、东金二同志：你们所提土地改革后妇女分财产的问题，我们已请华北人民政府司法部解答如下：
    （一）土地改革中已出嫁的女子，在娘家计入了人口，分了财产，与其寡居母亲所分财产合在一起共同经营，其母死后，应由女儿继承，本族近属不能继承，在土地证上，应填写母女两个人的名字。
    （二）农民以人口为单位，平分了地主阶级的土地财产之后，就以家庭为单位合成了个体经济，应视为伙有，共同经营与发展，土地平分之后，增加了人口，土地就不动了，只有用提高生产，使没有分到土地的人，也能从生产中增加收入。人人都有一份财产权利。女孩出嫁或离婚，准许带走她自己应分得的一份土地，其他任何人不得干涉。
