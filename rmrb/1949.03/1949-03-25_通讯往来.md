(I) To responsible comrades of youth, women's, and other mass organizations, as well as student unions of major universities and middle schools in Beiping:

Please promptly organize reports on your recent work, the preparations for establishing the New Democratic Youth League, and the dynamics of youth and women's work.  We further hope that you will urge your existing newspaper correspondents and correspondence groups to quickly contact our newspaper and help establish new correspondence organizations.

(II) To our newspaper's correspondents in various locations: If you have been transferred from your original work posts to cities such as Beiping, Tianjin, Zhangjiakou, Baoding, Tangshan, or other nearby areas, please immediately write and inform us of your current correspondence address so that we can stay in touch.  Also, please report on your recent work.

(III) To all factory trade unions, correspondents, and worker comrades:

In the past few days, our newspaper has received many materials on worker training classes, evening schools, study groups, and other worker learning activities. These valuable materials have greatly helped our newspaper. Therefore, we hope that you will quickly and more widely send us such materials to promote learning among other workers.

In your reports, pay attention to reporting on the experiences gained in learning and the changes in workers' work and thinking after learning. Please organize specific reports on these aspects.
