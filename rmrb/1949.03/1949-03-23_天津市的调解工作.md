　　Tianjin's Mediation Work
　　Tianjin Branch
    Over the past two months, the Tianjin Municipal Civil Affairs Bureau, district governments, and People's Courts have achieved considerable success in handling civil disputes through mediation. According to February statistics alone, the Civil Affairs Bureau and district governments received 889 requests for mediation from citizens. After mediation, 526 cases were resolved, 245 were in the process of mediation, and only 118 cases were transferred to the courts for mediation or litigation due to the failure of mediation. The Civil Affairs Bureau and district governments generally adopt two methods for mediating civil disputes. One method involves summoning the parties involved to ascertain the facts of the matter. For more complex cases, an investigation is conducted before presenting opinions and allowing both parties to negotiate. Once both parties reach an agreement, a settlement contract is signed, and the government issues a mediation certificate to each party. The other method involves explaining the relevant policies and regulations to the parties based on the nature of the dispute, and then allowing both parties to return home to seek assistance from relatives and friends to resolve the issue. After successful negotiation, the government issues a certificate. Parties who have resolved disputes through these mediation steps have saved time on litigation and are able to focus on production, which they are very satisfied with. The People's Courts also prioritize mediation when handling civil cases and minor criminal cases. In February, out of 130 civil cases concluded by the courts, 60 were successfully mediated in court and 36 were settled out of court, accounting for 73% of the total concluded cases. Out of 293 criminal cases concluded, 69 minor cases were successfully mediated, and this does not include cases mediated by the court's legal aid office and street public offices. The general steps of the court's mediation work are as follows: when the legal aid office drafts complaints, minor disputes are immediately advised to be resolved without litigation. For example, a painter surnamed Wu from Wandezhuang wanted to divorce his wife due to a quarrel. After two patient rounds of persuasion and explanation by the legal aid office, they reconciled. After the complaint is submitted, the judge will first attempt reconciliation. For example, the dispute between Taidong Company and a Yingkou merchant over debt was resolved after seven mediations. In general, staff members have fully demonstrated their loyalty, responsibility, and service to the people in the mediation work. However, some individual comrades have made some mistakes: (1) In mediating labor-capital disputes, some failed to grasp the principle of developing production and benefiting both labor and capital, swaying left and right. (2) Due to the large number of cases, some wanted to conclude cases with just a few words or simply pushed them out for out-of-court settlement, forming an irresponsible laissez-faire tendency. (3) Individual cases showed a tendency towards unprincipled reconciliation. For example, in cases where a daughter-in-law suffered cruel abuse and persecution from her mother-in-law and husband, they were simply persuaded, neglecting the laws protecting women's democratic rights. In order to further strengthen the mediation work and correct the above shortcomings, the People's Government officially established a Mediation and Arbitration Committee on the 16th, jointly composed of the Civil Affairs Bureau, the Tianjin Office of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, the People's Court, and the Foreign Affairs Office of the Industry and Commerce Bureau. In addition to being responsible for mediating disputes involving foreigners and major disputes, it also directly guides the mediation work of district streets.

　　天津市的调解工作
    天津分社
    天津市民政局、各区政府及人民法院，两月来用调解方式处理民间纠纷，已获得相当成绩。仅二月份统计，市民向民政局及各区政府请求调解的共有八百八十九件，经调解后解决的五百二十六件，正在调解中的有二百四十五件，只有一百一十八件因调解不能解决而转交法院请求调解或起诉。民政局和各区政府对于民间纠纷的调解方式，大致有两种。一种是把当事人找来问明事实真象，比较复杂的则经过调查，然后提出意见，让双方协商，俟彼此意见一致后，即订立和解契约，由政府各发给一份调解证书。另一种是就纠纷的性质，先向当事人解释有关的政策和法令，再让双方回去找亲友帮助解决，协商成功后，由政府出具证明。经过此种调解步骤解决了纠纷的当事人，节省出涉讼的时间搞生产，都非常满意。人民法院对于处理民事案件与轻微的刑事案件，也是以调解为主。二月份法院民事结案一百三十件中，经当庭调解成功的就有六十件，案外和解的三十六件，共占结案总数百分之七十三。刑事结案二百九十三件，其中情节轻微经调解成功的也有六十九件，由法院代书处及各街公所调解者尚未计算在内。法院调解工作，一般的步骤是：代书处代写诉状时，遇有小的纠纷即当时予以劝解，让他们最好不要起诉。例如万德庄一个姓吴的油漆匠，因口角要跟老婆离婚，经过代书处两次耐心的劝导解释，他们已和好如初。诉状递上去以后，审判员也是先试行和解。如泰东公司跟营口商人债务的纠纷，经七次的调解，终于解决。一般工作人员在调解工作中，都充分表现了对人民忠实负责为人民服务的精神，但也有个别同志犯了些毛病：（一）在调解劳资纠纷时，有的掌握不住发展生产，劳资两利的原则，忽左忽右。（二）由于案件多，有的三言两语便想了结，或干脆推出去让在外和解，形成不负责的自流倾向。（三）个别有无原则和解的偏向。例如媳妇受婆婆丈夫残酷的虐待、迫害，也只是劝说了事，忽略了保障妇女民主权利的法令。人民政府为了进一步加强调解工作，纠正上述缺点，已于十六日正式成立调解仲裁委员会，由民政局、总工会天津办事处、人民法院、工商局外事处联合组成。除本身负责调解有关外侨及各项重大争议外，并直接指导各区街的调解工作。
