The Savings Department of the People's Bank of China, Beiping Branch
Provisional Regulations for Savings Deposits
Promulgated on April 1, 1949

　　I. Purpose: To promote thrift and encourage savings among all sectors of society, government agencies, organizations, and enterprises, we are introducing inflation-adjusted savings deposits.

　　II. Types: The following four types will be offered temporarily: (1) Fixed Deposit, Fixed Withdrawal; (2) Deposit Principal, Pay Interest; (3) Zero Deposit, Fixed Withdrawal; (4) Fixed Deposit, Zero Withdrawal.

　　III. Calculation Standard: These savings deposits are calculated using a "standard commodity unit." One standard commodity unit includes the following three items in specified quantities: one *jin* of Wanshoushan vermicelli, one *jin* of corn flour, and one *chi* of Erchang Wufu cloth. The price of these items will be based on the wholesale prices published in the *People's Daily*. If there are multiple prices in a day, the average will be calculated. If the designated brand of commodities is changed, disappears, or is no longer a widely applicable standard, the Bank reserves the right to designate other brands of similar quality as replacements and will announce such changes. However, deposits made before the change will not be recalculated. Deposits and withdrawals will be calculated based on the average price of the previous five days. Note: (1) Each bag of Wanshoushan vermicelli mentioned in this article is calculated at 44 *jin*. (2) Each small bag of corn flour is calculated at 20 *jin*. (3) Each *pi* of Erchang Wufu cloth is calculated at 100 *chi*.

　　IV. Storage Methods:

　　A. Fixed Deposit, Fixed Withdrawal: (1) For this type of deposit, the depositor must agree on a fixed term in advance when depositing funds with the Bank. The Bank will issue a deposit certificate as proof. Principal and interest will be withdrawn together upon maturity. The minimum deposit amount is five standard commodity units. (2) Terms: Divided into three types: one year, six months, and three months. (3) Interest Rates: Three-month term, monthly interest of 3 *li*; six-month term, monthly interest of 5 *li*; one-year term, monthly interest of 8 *li*. (4) Early Withdrawal: This type of deposit cannot be withdrawn before maturity. However, in special circumstances such as weddings, funerals, or illnesses, with the Bank's approval and upon presentation of proof, a "Request for Early Withdrawal" can be filled out and, after verification, paid according to the following regulations: ① If the deposit has been held for less than three months, it will be paid at the original currency amount, without interest. If prices have fallen, it will still be paid at the inflation-adjusted rate without interest. ② If the deposit has been held for three months or more, it will be paid at the inflation-adjusted rate, with interest reduced to 1.5 *li*. ③ For a one-year term, if withdrawn after six months or more, both principal and interest will be paid at the inflation-adjusted rate, with interest calculated at a monthly rate of 3 *li*; if held for nine months or more, the interest rate will be calculated at a monthly rate of 5 *li*. (5) Overdue Withdrawal: If this type of deposit is not withdrawn after maturity and no extension is requested, the principal and interest will still be converted at the price on the original maturity date if withdrawn within ten days. No interest will be calculated beyond that date. If not withdrawn after more than ten days, the principal and interest will be transferred to a current account and accrue interest at the Bank's current account rate. If depositors wish to extend the term, they should notify the Bank before the maturity date. Applications for extension after the maturity date will be calculated at the exchange rate on the day the application is received. If applying by mail, the date the Bank receives the letter will be the effective date.

　　B. Deposit Principal, Pay Interest: (1) For this type of deposit, the minimum deposit amount is twenty standard commodity units. A lump sum deposit is made for a pre-agreed term, and the Bank issues a deposit book. Interest is withdrawn monthly upon presentation of the book. Interest not withdrawn upon maturity will not be compounded. Interest withdrawals will still be converted at the price on the original interest payment date, and the principal will be withdrawn upon maturity. (2) Terms: Divided into two types: six months and one year. (3) Interest Rates: Six-month term, monthly interest of 3 *li*; one-year term, monthly interest of 6 *li*. (4) Early Withdrawal: If circumstances as listed in Section IV of "Fixed Deposit, Fixed Withdrawal" are encountered, early withdrawal may be permitted after approval. However, the interest already paid will be deducted. The method is as follows: ① If the deposit has been held for less than three months, the principal will be paid at the original currency amount, and the interest will be deducted at the original currency amount. If prices have fallen, the principal will still be paid at the inflation-adjusted rate, and the interest already paid will also be deducted at the inflation-adjusted rate. ② If the deposit has been held for three months or more, the principal will be refunded at the inflation-adjusted rate, and the interest already paid will be calculated at the inflation-adjusted rate and deducted after deducting the interest that should have been obtained according to the regulations in Section IV of "Fixed Deposit, Fixed Withdrawal."

　　C. Zero Deposit, Fixed Withdrawal: (1) This type of deposit is a fixed-term savings deposit where deposits are made in installments and withdrawn in a lump sum at maturity. The term is divided into two types: six months and one year. The deposit frequency is divided into four types: once every half month, once every month, once every two months, and once every three months, chosen by the depositor. Each month is counted as 30 days, and half a month as 15 days. (2) Amount: The fixed amount to be deposited each time, with a minimum of one unit. There is no limit to the maximum amount, which is determined by the depositor when opening the account. Once the amount is determined, it cannot be changed. (3) Interest Rates: Six-month term, monthly interest of 3 *li*; one-year term, monthly interest of 6 *li*. (4) Interruption of Deposits: If deposits are interrupted midway, interest will still be paid upon maturity, but the rate will be reduced to 2.4 *li* for a six-month term and 5 *li* for a one-year term. (5) Early Withdrawal: If early withdrawal is required, it will be handled according to the method in Section IV of "Fixed Deposit, Fixed Withdrawal." However, if the deposit has been held for three months or more, the interest will be calculated at 1 *li*; for a one-year term, if held for six months or more, interest will be calculated at a monthly rate of 2.4 *li*; if held for nine months or more, interest will be calculated at a monthly rate of 4.2 *li*. (6) Late Deposit: If a deposit is made late, it will be calculated at the exchange rate on the original deposit date if within five days. If the delay exceeds five days, it will be considered an interruption. If prices have risen when making up the missed deposit, it will be converted at the exchange rate on the day of the supplementary deposit. If prices have fallen, it will still be converted at the exchange rate on the original deposit date. If the number of missed deposits is more than one-third of the total number of deposits, the interest rate will be reduced to 2.7 *li* for a six-month term and 5.4 *li* for a one-year term.

　　D. Fixed Deposit, Zero Withdrawal: (1) For this type of deposit, the depositor makes a lump sum deposit of the principal, and the Bank issues a deposit book. Principal is then withdrawn in installments upon presentation of the book, and interest is settled upon maturity. The minimum deposit amount is 24 standard commodity units. There is no limit to the maximum amount, but it should be easily divisible into equal installments. (2) Terms: Divided into two types: six months and one year. The withdrawal frequency is divided into three types: once a month, once every two months, and once every three months, chosen by the depositor. Once determined, it cannot be changed. No interest will be calculated for withdrawals made after the maturity date. (3) Interest Rates: Same as the regulations for "Zero Deposit, Fixed Withdrawal" for six-month and one-year terms. (4) Early Withdrawal: If early withdrawal is required, it will be handled according to the method in Section IV of "Fixed Deposit, Fixed Withdrawal." (1) If the deposit has been held for less than three months, the unwithdrawn portion will be paid at the original currency amount. If prices have fallen, it will be paid at the inflation-adjusted rate without interest. (2) If the deposit has been held for three months or more, the unwithdrawn portion will be paid at the inflation-adjusted rate, with interest calculated at 1.2 *li*. If held for six months or more, interest will be calculated at 2.7 *li*; if held for nine months or more, interest will be calculated at 4.5 *li*.

　　V. When opening any type of deposit account, the depositor must first fill out a "Inflation-Adjusted Savings Deposit Account Opening Application," choosing the type of deposit and specifying the account name, occupation, address, and other items. If withdrawals require a signature or seal, an impression must be left in advance for verification purposes.

　　VI. Storage: When depositing funds, the deposit book must be brought to the Bank for registration. The entries made by the Bank's tellers and responsible personnel must be stamped to be valid. If there is any incorrect entry, please inform the Bank for verification and correction. Do not make corrections yourself.

　　VII. Withdrawal: When withdrawing funds, the depositor must bring the deposit book and seal, and issue a withdrawal slip. Payment will only be made after the Bank's staff verifies that everything is correct. If no seal impression has been left, payment will be made upon presentation of the book.

　　VIII. Loss Reporting: If a depositor loses the deposit book or seal, they must report the loss to the Bank. Half a month after the report, a guarantor must be found, or proof must be provided by a government agency, to the Bank to replace the lost items with new documents. If the Bank deems it necessary, a loss statement must be published in the local newspaper for at least two days. The depositor is responsible for any fraudulent withdrawals made before the loss report.

　　IX. The interest rate provisions in these Regulations may be changed and announced at any time if necessary. However, deposits made before the change will still be calculated at the original interest rate.

　　X. The Bank reserves the right to amend these Regulations at any time regarding matters not covered herein.
