　　Szutze Cotton (No. 4) - A type of cotton. Originally a superior variety cultivated in the United States, it was introduced to China before the "July 7th" Incident. The seedlings are slightly deep red, and the leaves turn mostly red in autumn. The entire plant is pyramidal in shape, with high yields and a high ginning percentage, making it the best in North China today. The fibers are fine and long, suitable for spinning cotton yarn of 40 counts or higher. The cotton bolls are particularly large (each boll yields 2.6 or 2.7 qian of seed cotton), and 65 cotton bolls can yield one jin of seed cotton.

　　Central Task - The different priorities in each stage of the Party and the democratic government's leadership of the people in various revolutionary tasks are called central tasks. Central tasks are determined based on the mass demands and revolutionary task requirements of different periods. For example, now that the spring plowing season has arrived, the central task of the Party and the government is to lead the people in production, and everything else, such as supporting the front, shouldering burdens, and land reform, should revolve around the goal of production. However, if the war situation becomes tense, then the central task should be shifted to supporting the front according to the new situation.

    中心工作—党与民主政府在领导人民进行各种革命工作时，每一个阶段的不同的重点都叫做中心工作。中心工作是依据不同时期的群众要求与革命任务要求来决定的。比如目前已到春耕季节，那么党与政府的中心工作就是领导人民进行生产，其他一切如支前、负担、土地改革等都应该围绕着生产的目的来进行；但如战争情况紧张时，那么中心工作就应依据新的情况来转为支前。
