Hua University Animal Husbandry and Veterinary Science Faculty and Students Go to the Countryside to Eradicate Swine Fever

[This newspaper's report] The faculty and students of the Animal Husbandry and Veterinary Science Department of the Agricultural College of North China University went to Dingxing, Rongcheng, Yi County, and Dingxin counties on the 9th of this month to urgently treat swine fever, investigate the infectious disease of swine fever, and publicize prevention and isolation methods. Significant results have been achieved in half a month. According to statistics from eleven villages including Jiu'anzhuang in Dingxing, a total of 1,920 pigs were raised. Since December of last year, 364 pigs have died from the plague (amounting to a loss of about 1 million RMB). After repeated publicity on the necessity of isolating infected pigs from healthy pigs, and the preventive measures of disinfecting pig pens with lime, and after conducting swine fever inspections and serum injections at the Dingxing Chengguan, Guzhen and other market towns, and conducting prevention publicity, the spread of swine fever has largely stopped.

Later investigations revealed three reasons for the spread of swine fever: First, market transmission: Farmers, fearing their sick pigs would die, rushed them to the market to sell them cheaply. Some people, lured by the low price, bought the infected pigs and brought them back to their villages, thus spreading the disease. Second, meat shops bought infected pigs, raised them for two days, slaughtered them, and then fed the leftovers to newly bought pigs, resulting in the pigs getting sick as well. Third, healthy pigs that approached or lived in places where infected pigs had been were more likely to get sick. In counties such as Dingxing, Rongcheng, and Dingxin, farmers have a habit of raising pigs. Almost every village and household has pig-raising facilities. In addition to increasing income, they can also accumulate a large amount of fertilizer. It is estimated that Ding County has about 40,000 pigs, with an average of more than two pigs raised per household. Hongshu Village in Ding County, which raises the most pigs, has 110 households raising more than 360 pigs, averaging three pigs per household. Swine fever has often occurred in this area in previous years, causing great losses to farmers, but no one cared or asked about it during the enemy-puppet rule.

### 华大畜牧兽医系师生　下乡扑灭猪瘟

　　华大畜牧兽医系师生
    下乡扑灭猪瘟
    【本报讯】华北大学农学院畜牧兽医系师生，本月九日赴定兴、荣城、易县、定新等县急治猪瘟，并作了猪瘟传染病的调查，宣传预防和隔离的办法，半月间已有显著成绩。据定兴久安庄等十一个村统计，共养猪一千九百二十口，自去年十二月起已瘟死三百六十四口（合损失人民币一百万左右）。经再三宣传了一定要使瘟猪与好猪隔离，并以石灰消毒猪圈的预防办法，又在定兴城关、固镇等集市上进行了猪瘟检查与血清注射，和预防宣传后，猪瘟大体已停止发展。
    后调查中了解到猪瘟所以如此蔓延的原因有三：一、集市传染：农民的猪得病后怕猪死了，就马上赶到集上很贱的卖掉，有人图便宜，把瘟猪就买回村子里，这样便在村里传染起来了。二、肉店买到瘟猪后，养两天，杀了，瘟猪的剩食，又给新买的猪吃，结果也得了病。三、瘟猪住过的地方，好猪接近或者再去住，更容易发生病症。按定兴、荣城、定新等县，农民都有养猪习惯，每村每户差不多都有圈猪设备，除增加一批收入外，还能大量积肥，定县估计约有四万口猪，全县平均一户喂两口以上。养猪最多的定县红树村一百一十户中养了三百六十余口，每户平均三口。这一地区往年也常闹猪瘟，农民损失很大，但在敌伪统治期间，从来无人关心过问。
