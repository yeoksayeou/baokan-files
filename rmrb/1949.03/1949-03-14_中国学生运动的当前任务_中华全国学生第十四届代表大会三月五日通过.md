　　The Current Tasks of the Chinese Student Movement
    ——Adopted by the 14th National Student Congress of China on March 5th
    (I) The Chinese student movement, since the "May Fourth" Movement in 1919, has been closely integrated with the Chinese people's New Democratic revolutionary movement against imperialism and feudalism for thirty years.
    In the four historical periods of the Chinese New Democratic Revolution, namely, the Northern Expedition, the Agrarian Revolutionary War, the War of Resistance Against Japan, and the current People's Liberation War, Chinese students have played a very important role. During the "May Fourth" Movement, Chinese students were the first to raise the banner against imperialism and the traitorous government of the Northern Warlords. It then expanded into a mass movement involving all strata of society, unveiling the first act of the Chinese New Democratic Revolution. Later, in the "May 30th" Movement and the Northern Expedition, the broad masses of Chinese students conducted extremely heroic struggles. In 1935, under the severe White Terror implemented by the Kuomintang reactionary and traitorous government, Chinese students launched the "December 9th" Movement, responding to the call of the Chinese Communist Party at the time, putting forward the slogans of "Stop the Civil War, Unite to Resist Japan" and "Strive for Democracy," and actively participated in the national salvation movement at that time. This movement became the prelude to the outbreak of the War of Resistance Against Japan. During the War of Resistance Against Japan, the broad masses of students publicized, mobilized, and organized the people, actively participating in and supporting the war. After the victory of the War of Resistance Against Japan, Chinese students held various revolutionary struggles against the US-Chiang regime continuously and heroically under the cruel suppression of the Kuomintang reactionary rule in the "December 1st" of 1945, "June 23rd," "December 30th" of 1946, "May 20th" of 1947, and the April and June Movements of 1948. The central slogans貫串throughout these movements were: Oppose US imperialism's interference in China's internal affairs, protest against the atrocities of the US military in China, oppose US imperialism's support for Japan, oppose the Kuomintang reactionary government's betrayal of China and carrying out an anti-people war; oppose the Kuomintang reactionary government's persecution of the people, and oppose the Kuomintang government's tyrannical rule that caused the people to starve. These movements further isolated the US-Chiang regime, accelerated the collapse of the Kuomintang reactionary rule, and strengthened the people's forces, playing an important supporting role in the victorious development of the People's Liberation War.
    Chinese students urgently demanded the establishment of an independent, free, and happy New Democratic country. During the War of Resistance Against Japan and the People's Liberation War, countless students, in pursuit of the light, were not afraid of difficulties and dangers, and arrived at the various liberated areas of New Democracy, participating in schools opened in various places, such as the Anti-Japanese Military and Political University in Yan'an, the Shaanbei Public School, the Anwu Youth Training Class, and the North China United University, to study revolutionary theories and policies, actively participating in front-line or rear-area work, and various construction works in the liberated areas. Under the New Democratic regime, in addition to the large number of students in the past, children of workers and peasants could also attend school in large numbers. Students from outside combined with students in the liberated areas and newly grown worker-peasant intellectuals, cultivated the viewpoint of serving the workers, peasants, and the masses, and a simple, practical, and disciplined style. Many students personally participated in the great land reform movement to eliminate feudal forces, and participated in the people's labor production movement and other social service activities of various wars. After studying in schools and undergoing various trainings, thousands of students have gradually been cultivated into cadres needed by a sound New Democratic country. They have played an important and positive role in the consolidation and development of the people's democratic regime in the past and will continue to do so in the future.
    In short, the Chinese student movement over the past thirty years has made great contributions to the cause of liberation of the Chinese people. In the semi-colonial and semi-feudal old country, it not only played the role of a bridge for disseminating revolutionary theory, but also became an active participant and organizer of the Chinese people's revolutionary movement. The history of the Chinese student movement over the past thirty years is a history of the development of intellectuals towards integration with the workers and peasants.
    The Chinese student movement has become increasingly widespread and in-depth with the development of the revolutionary situation. In each movement, it has not only raised the awareness of the broad masses of students and the people, but also cultivated thousands upon thousands of revolutionary cadres for the cause of the New Democratic Revolution, and will play an even greater role in the future construction of New Democracy.
    (II) At present, the People's Liberation War has achieved unprecedented victory, the Kuomintang reactionary government is about to be completely destroyed, and the whole of China is about to be liberated. The oppression of imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucrat-capitalism that we Chinese students and the people have opposed together will be overthrown by us. This is such an exciting thing, and our years of efforts are about to bear fruit; the blood of the martyrs has not been shed in vain; history is finally advancing in the direction pointed out by the leader of the Chinese people - Mao Zedong. However, the Kuomintang reactionary government is still making a dying struggle, and under the conspiracy of US imperialism, it attempts to preserve its remaining military forces with the hypocritical slogan of peace in order to stage a comeback. The 14th National Congress of the Students of the Republic of China specially calls on students across the country to firmly support the eight conditions for genuine democratic peace put forward by Chairman Mao Zedong of the Chinese Communist Party, and together with the Chinese people, step up efforts to smash the hypocritical peace of US imperialism and the Kuomintang reactionary government, carry the revolution through to the end, and establish a New Democratic People's Republic of China throughout the country. This is the primary task of the current Chinese student movement.
    Precisely because the Kuomintang reactionary rule is about to be overthrown by the people of the whole country, and the obstacles to the establishment of a New Democratic country will be basically removed, the task of building a New Democratic country is becoming increasingly important. Therefore, Chinese students must not only continue to actively participate in the struggle against imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucrat-capitalism, and strive to participate in and support the front line of the People's Liberation War, but also work hard for the construction of the New Democratic country. Because actively participating in various construction works of the New Democratic country is a new and increasingly heavy task for the Chinese student movement, we must strengthen our studies under New Democratic education and cultivate ourselves into talented people for the construction of the New Democratic country's regime.
    (III) The student movement in the Kuomintang-controlled areas should unite itself more widely than in the past, and unite with the broad masses of the people to carry out resolute struggles against US imperialism and the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang in various forms. In particular, we must be good at exposing the Kuomintang reactionary government's hypocritical peace and strive to realize the eight conditions put forward by Chairman Mao Zedong.
    The Kuomintang reactionary government's education system trains our students to become slaves of imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucrat-capitalism. In order to protect the interests of the students themselves, we must oppose the reactionary education system. The student movement in the Kuomintang-controlled areas should, like the anti-hunger and anti-civil war movement of Chinese students in 1947, link the improvement of students' own lives, the protection of their own welfare, and the struggle against US imperialism and the Kuomintang reactionary government, and should do everything possible to study New Democratic revolutionary theory, understand the truth of the Chinese revolution, enlighten the consciousness of the surrounding masses, and, where possible, conduct propaganda to the workers, peasants, and people of all strata.
    Because in the near future, the whole country will be liberated, and the schools run by the Kuomintang reactionary government will be transferred to the hands of the people, we call on the students in the Kuomintang-controlled areas to do everything possible to fight against the Kuomintang reactionary government's sabotage, theft, and relocation of school instruments, books, and all equipment in the laboratory. Strive to keep the school intact. In the student movement in the Kuomintang-controlled areas, we should unite with all progressive and potentially cooperative faculty and staff to fight together, and do not alienate them and isolate ourselves. This approach should also be adopted for social strata outside the school.
    (IV) The student movement in the liberated areas is being carried out under completely new conditions. The students in the liberated areas have already been liberated in the struggle against imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucrat-capitalism, and have obtained the New Democratic country that they have striven for for a long time. Here, schools that implement the New Democratic education policy belong to the people and to the students themselves. The New Democratic education policy is consistent with the learning requirements of the broad masses of students. Therefore, students in the liberated areas should actively help the school and strive to cultivate a large number of talented people for various construction works with revolutionary ideas and specialized knowledge in order to realize the New Democratic education policy. We must recognize that the construction of a New Democratic country, especially from a backward agricultural country to an industrial country, is a very important and arduous task. It is by no means easier than overthrowing reactionary rule. In order to build this new country, we need military, political, economic, and cultural construction talents. Therefore, students in the liberated areas must first strengthen their studies, study New Democratic revolutionary theory, study political, economic, cultural, scientific, and other modern knowledge, and establish a life outlook and world outlook of serving the working people.
    Our study, in addition to working hard on our lessons, must also include various social service labors. Without affecting regular studies, we must unite students to respond to the call of the People's Democratic Government to participate in propaganda and education of the masses, condolences to the People's Liberation Army, and condolences to the families of revolutionary soldiers, so as to cultivate our own service capabilities from practice.
    The student union in the liberated area is a mass organization of students themselves. Its basic task, in general, is to unite teachers and students, organize and carry out learning assistance and learning competitions centered on regular courses from the bottom up, inspire students' awareness of learning, and give play to their creativity and initiative. In addition, organize students to participate in social service activities and seek welfare for students, such as helping to solve students' difficulties, organizing cultural, recreational, sports, health, visits, travel and other activities.
    The organization of student unions should not be overlapping or cumbersome. When carrying out the above-mentioned activities in the school, students should freely form groups and freely gather. There should be whatever organization is needed according to the needs of the students. The members of the student union should influence and promote students to carry out their work through persuasive education, patient explanation, and their own exemplary actions.
    The student union should care for and cherish schools that implement the New Democratic education policy, and should regularly put forward active suggestions and methods for improvement in all aspects of the school, and should send representatives to participate in school affairs or academic affairs meetings. At the same time, the student union should generally accept guidance from the school's administrative aspects, and student union meetings should invite representatives of the school's faculty and staff to participate in order to achieve the goal of enhancing unity between teachers and students and implementing the New Democratic education policy and the implementation of the plan.
    (V) The history of the student movement over the past thirty years clearly shows that the reason why Chinese students have been able to achieve brilliant achievements is because our student movement is closely integrated with the Chinese people's revolutionary movement, especially the combination of students and workers and peasants in each movement. Secondly, it is because the students love the truth and are resolute and heroic. All this shows us that students across the country and the student movement in the future must resolutely support the propositions of the Chinese Communist Party and serve the working people—the workers and peasants. Only by uniting students and working hard in the spirit of serving the working people without the slightest slack can the above-mentioned student movement guidelines and tasks be fully realized.
    In order to specifically implement the above-mentioned student movement guidelines and tasks, and in order to implement the resolutions of this National Student Congress, it is necessary to establish a unified organization of students across China, including students in the liberated areas and the Kuomintang-controlled areas, in order to regularly guide the actions of students across the country and to facilitate participation in domestic revolutionary movements and international democratic student movements. The 14th National Congress of the Students of the Republic of China was held in Beiping, the ancient capital that recently gained liberation and the birthplace of the Chinese student movement. This is the beginning of the victorious meeting of students in the liberated areas and students in the Kuomintang-controlled areas. The congress believes that there are sufficient conditions to establish a unified organization of students across the country. The congress decided to establish the All-China Students' Federation.
    Students across the country! The current period is a period of great historical transformation. We must unite, inherit the glorious revolutionary traditions since the "May Fourth," "May 30th," and "December 9th" movements, and, together with the Chinese people, strive to completely overthrow the rule of US imperialism and the Kuomintang reactionary government in China, and build a New Democratic People's Republic!

　　中国学生运动的当前任务
    ——中华全国学生第十四届代表大会三月五日通过
    （一）中国的学生运动，从一九一九年“五四”运动起，三十年来，和中国人民的反对帝国主义与封建主义的新民主主义革命运动紧密地结合在一起。
    在中国新民主主义革命的四个历史时期中，即是在北伐战争、土地革命战争、抗日战争和目前的人民解放战争中，中国学生都曾起了十分重要的作用。“五四”运动中中国学生首先高举起反对帝国主义与北洋军阀卖国政府的旗帜。接着扩大为各阶层参加的群众运动，揭开了中国新民主主义革命的第一幕。以后在“五卅”运动及北伐战争中，中国广大的学生群众进行了极为英勇的斗争。在一九三五年国民党反动卖国政府实行严重的白色恐怖下，中国学生发动了“一二九”运动，响应中国共产党当时的号召，提出了“停止内战，一致抗日”与“争取民主”的口号，积极参加了当时的全国救亡运动，这一运动成为以后爆发抗日战争的序幕。在抗日战争中，广大学生群众，宣传、动员和组织人民，积极参加和支援了战争。在抗日战争胜利以后，中国学生在一九四五年“一二、一”，一九四六年的“六、二三”，“一二、卅”，一九四七年的“五、二○”，一九四八年的四月和六月运动，三年当中，在国民党反动统治残酷的镇压之下，连续地英勇地举行了反对美蒋的各种革命斗争。贯串着这些运动的中心口号是：反对美帝国主义干涉中国内政，抗议美军在中国的暴行，反对美帝国主义扶植日本，反对国民党反动政府出卖中国、进行反人民的战争；反对国民党反动政府对人民的迫害，反对国民党政府造成人民饥饿的暴政。这些运动使美蒋更趋于孤立，加速国民党反动统治的崩溃，使人民力量更加壮大，对人民解放战争胜利的发展，起了重要的配合作用。
    中国学生迫切地要求建立一个独立、自由和幸福的新民主主义的国家。在抗日战争与人民解放战争时期，无数学生为了追求光明，不怕困难和危险，到达新民主主义的各个解放区，参加各地开办的学校，如延安抗日军政大学、陕北公学、安吴青年训练班和华北联合大学等校学习革命的理论和政策，积极地参加前线或后方的工作，以及解放区内的各种建设工作。在新民主主义政权下，除开旧有的大批学生之外，工农子弟也能够大批地上学了，外面进来的学生与解放区内的学生和新生长的工农知识分子结合在一起，养成了为工农大众服务的观点，和朴素、切实、遵守纪律的作风，许多学生都亲身参加过伟大的消灭封建势力的土地改革运动，和参加过人民的劳动生产运动以及其他各种战争的社会的服务活动。千万的学生经过学校学习又经过种种锻炼之后，就逐渐地培养成为健全的新民主主义国家所需要的干部。他们在过去和将来对于人民民主政权的巩固与发展都是起着重要的积极作用的。
    总之，三十年来的中国学生运动，对于中国人民的解放事业，作了很大的贡献。在半殖民地半封建的旧国度中，它曾经不仅起了传播革命理论的桥梁作用，而且成为中国人民革命运动的积极参加者和组织者。三十年来的中国学生运动史是一部知识分子走向与工农群众相结合的发展史。
    中国学生运动随着革命形势的开展而日益广泛与深入。在每次运动中，不仅提高了广大学生与人民群众的觉悟，并且为新民主主义革命事业培养了成千成万的革命干部，而在将来新民主主义建设事业中，还要起着更大的作用。
    （二）目前人民解放战争获得了空前的胜利，国民党反动政府即将完全灭亡，全中国快要解放了。我们中国学生和人民在一起所反对的帝国主义、封建主义与官僚资本主义的压迫，将要被我们推翻。这是多么振奋人心的事，我们多年的努力即将得到成果；烈士的鲜血，没有白流；历史终于是按着中国人民领袖——毛泽东所指出的方向前进。但是，国民党反动政府还在作垂死的挣扎，在美国帝国主义的阴谋策动下，企图以虚伪的和平的口号，保存残余的军事力量，以便卷土重来。我们中华民国学生第十四届代表大会特号召全国同学，坚决拥护中国共产党毛泽东主席提出的真正民主和平的八项条件，和中国人民在一起，加紧努力，粉碎美国帝国主义与国民党反动政府的虚伪和平，把革命进行到底，在全国范围内建立新民主主义的中华人民民主共和国，这就是当前中国学生运动的首要任务。
    正因为国民党反动统治即将被全国人民推翻，建立新民主主义国家的障碍将被基本扫除，建设新民主主义国家的任务，就日益重要。因此，中国学生不仅要继续积极地参加反对帝国主义、封建主义及官僚资本主义的斗争，努力参加和支援人民解放战争的前线，并且必须为了新民主主义国家建设工作而努力。因为积极参加新民主主义国家的各种建设工作，是中国学生运动日益加重的新任务，因此，必须在新民主主义教育下，加强学习，培养自己成为建设新民主主义国家的政权人才。
    （三）国民党统治区的学生运动，应该比较过去更加广泛地团结自己，并和广大人民群众团结在一起，对美国帝国主义与国民党的反动统治，以各种形式进行坚决的斗争。特别是要善于揭穿国民党反动政府的虚伪和平，并为争取实现毛泽东主席所提出的八项条件而奋斗。
    国民党反动政府的教育制度，训练我们同学成为帝国主义、封建主义与官僚资本主义的奴仆。为了保障同学自身利益，必须对反动的教育制度加以反对。国民党统治区的学生运动，应该如一九四七年中国学生的反饥饿和反内战运动一样，把改善同学们自身生活、保障自身福利和反抗美国帝国主义和国民党反动政府的斗争联系起来，并应尽一切可能学习新民主主义革命理论，认识中国革命真理，启发周围群众的觉悟，在可能的条件下，向工农及各阶层人民群众进行宣传。
    因为不久的将来，全国即将解放，国民党反动政府举办的学校都要转入人民手中，我们号召国民党统治区同学们，应该用尽一切方法和国民党反动政府破坏、盗卖、迁移学校仪器、图书、实验室一切设备作斗争。力争将学校完整地保留下来。在国民党统治区的学生运动中，应和一切进步的和可能合作的教职员团结在一起进行奋斗，而不要脱离他们使自己陷于孤立。对于学校以外的社会阶层，也应采取这个方针。
    （四）解放区的学生运动，是完全在一个新的条件之下进行的。解放区的同学们已经在反对帝国主义、封建主义和官僚资本主义的斗争中获得了解放，获得了长期争取的新民主主义国家。在这里，凡是实行新民主主义教育方针的学校就成为人民的，成为同学们自己的，新民主主义教育方针与广大同学们的学习要求是一致的。因此，解放区同学们都应该积极地帮助学校，为实现新民主主义教育的方针，培养大批有革命思想的有专门知识的各种建设工作的人材而努力。我们必须认清：新民主主义国家的建设，特别是从一个落后的农业国变为工业国，是一个十分重大而艰巨的任务。它绝不比推翻反动统治更为容易。为了建设这个新国家，需要军事、政治、经济、文化各种建设人才。因此，解放区的同学们首先必须加强学习，学习新民主主义革命理论，学习政治、经济、文化、科学等一切现代知识，并建立为劳动人民服务的人生观和世界观。
    我们的学习，除努力学习功课之外，同时也须有各种社会服务劳动。在不影响正课学习下，必须团结同学响应人民民主政府的号召，参加宣传教育群众、慰劳解放军、慰问革命军人家属等项工作，以便从实际中锻炼自己的服务能力。
    解放区的学生会，是学生自己的群众组织。它的基本任务，一般地就是团结师生，从下而上地组织和开展以正课为中心的学习互助与学习竞赛，启发同学们学习的自觉性，并发挥其创造性与积极性。此外，组织同学们参加社会服务活动，并为同学们谋福利，如帮助解决同学们的困难，组织文化、娱乐、体育、卫生、参观、旅行等活动。
    学生会的组织不应重叠与庞杂。在校内进行上列活动时，应由同学们自由结组与自由集会，应视同学们有何种需要，即有何种组织。学生会的委员应以说服教育、耐心解释以及自己的模范行动，来影响与推动同学们进行工作。
    学生会应关心与爱护实行新民主主义教育方针的学校，对学校各方面应经常提出积极改进的意见和办法，并得派代表参加校务或教务会议，同时学生会一般地应接受学校行政方面的指导，学生会开会应请学校教职员代表参加，以达到增进师生之间的团结，贯彻新民主主义教育方针和计划的实施为目的。
    （五）三十年来一部学生运动史，十分清楚地说明中国学生之所以能够获得辉煌的业绩，是由于我们学生运动和中国人民革命运动紧密的结合，特别是每次运动中学生和工农群众的结合。其次是由于同学们热爱真理，坚决英勇。这一切昭示我们，全国同学和今后的学生运动，必须坚决拥护中国共产党的主张，为劳动人民——工农群众服务，只有团结同学，本着为劳动人民服务的精神，丝毫不懈怠地努力，上述学生运动的方针和任务才能完全实现。
    为了具体地执行上述学生运动的方针和任务，为了执行本届全国学生代表大会的决议，需要成立包括解放区和国民党统治区内学生的全中国学生的统一的组织，以便经常地指导全国各地学生的行动，并便于参加国内的革命运动与国际的民主学生运动，中华全国学生第十四届代表大会，在中国学生运动的发源地、最近获得解放的古都北平召开。这是解放区同学和国民党统治区同学胜利会合的开始。大会认为已经有足够的条件来成立全国学生的统一的组织。大会决议成立中华全国学生联合会。
    全国同学们！目前是伟大的历史转变时期，我们必须团结起来，继承“五四”“五卅”“一二九”以来的光荣的革命传统，和中国人民在一起，为彻底推翻美国帝国主义和国民党反动政府在中国的统治，为建设新民主主义的人民民主共和国而奋斗。
