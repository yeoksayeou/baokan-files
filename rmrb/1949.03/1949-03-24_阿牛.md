　　A'niu
    Yiding
    Two weeks after the liberation of Beiping, I happened to run into a fellow villager while passing Dongdan Archway with a friend. His surname was Zhang, but I never knew his given name, only that everyone in the village called him A'niu.
    A'niu was wearing a People's Liberation Army uniform, so I knew he was a revolutionary soldier. Because it had been several years since we last met, this chance encounter made us both very excited, so I said goodbye to my friend and pulled A'niu into a teahouse. We drank tea and talked about our respective experiences since we parted. The things he talked about moved me deeply. The following is what he said.
    You know, my family was very poor to begin with. In the year of the Republic of China 27 (1938), our village suffered another famine. My father was old, my mother was sick, and my younger sister was young. Only my wife and I could work. In that year, the ten mu of land I rented from Wang Huan yielded nothing because of the flood, but Wang Huan came several times a day, forcing me to pay the rent. My sick mother had no choice but to tearfully agree to let my little sister work as a maid in his house to solve the problem.
    My elderly father needed to eat, and my sick mother needed medicine. How could I afford that? So I had to worry every day. Because of the hardship, my father was so hungry that he couldn't get out of bed, and my mother's illness got worse day by day. I worked twice as hard, but I couldn't earn more money, so I could only drink thin porridge once a day.
    Just at this difficult time, my mother died, and at the same time, my father fell ill from pain and hunger. What could I do? I really had no idea at the time. It was my father who told me to go see Wang Huan.
    Wang Huan's usual attitude towards the poor made me terribly afraid. My heart began to pound, but for my mother's death and my father's illness, I had to bow my head to that old bastard.
    Strangely enough, this time Wang Huan was surprisingly polite to me. He spoke to me with a smile on his face. He was very sorry for my mother's death and very sympathetic to my father's illness. He lent me five silver dollars and two dou of grain.
    Getting the money and grain was like a fish getting water. I happily went home. My father was also very happy to see it and kept muttering about the good things about the Wang family. In this way, I took care of my mother's funeral, and my father's illness also improved. In addition, the abundance of two dou of grain allowed me to avoid excessive labor.
    When my father was about to recover, my little sister brought food given by Wang Huan home once, and my father was even happier. But when I was sending my little sister out the door, she cried to me, saying that the Wang family treated her badly. Tell me, how sad I was as her brother!
    Two months after my father recovered, Wang Huan invited my father to his house. My father looked very sad when he came back. He bitterly told me that our house was now owned by the Wang family. My father fell ill again due to this blow. This time, he died in less than two weeks. Speaking of which, I am truly heartbroken. In order to hold a funeral for my father, I had no choice but to spend Wang Huan's money again.
    Wang Huan, this bastard, is hateful and detestable. He changed his face to me and forced me to work for him, using my wages to offset the interest on the debt. In this way, I will be his slave for the rest of my life!
    No matter how difficult the days are, there will eventually be an end. When the Eighth Route Army came to our village, I was saved! I was instructed by Comrade Wu to join the resistance against Japan. With the help of the government, I rescued my little sister and saved my wife.
    Time flies so fast. I fought the Japanese devils for a full eight years. After the victory, the Kuomintang reactionaries launched a civil war, and I am determined to carry the revolution through to the end!
    In the army, I have been cared for and guided by many comrades, and I am learning all the time. I, who was illiterate, can now write letters home and read.
    In the past battles, I risked my life and crawled out of the gunfire. I have been wounded in several places, so I became a squad leader. Now, I am liberated.
    Here I record Comrade Zhang's words to illustrate the revolutionary enthusiasm of the working people and to commemorate his glorious revolutionary experience.

　　阿牛
    一丁
    北平解放后的两个礼拜，我和朋友路过东单牌楼，无意中遇见一位同乡，他姓张，可是我从来就未曾知道过他的名字，只晓得村中人都呼他阿牛。
    阿牛穿着解放军的制服，所以我知道他是一个革命军人。为了几年未曾见面，所以这次巧遇，使我俩都非常兴奋，于是我便和我的朋友告别，拉着阿牛到一家茶馆里去。我俩一壁喝茶，一壁谈着分别后双方的经历，他谈的事情，使我非常感动，下面都是他说的。
    你知道，我家本来就很清寒，在民国二十七年，咱村又闹了荒年，我的爸爸年老，妈妈生病，妹妹年小，只有我和我的老婆还能作活儿。在这一年，我租的王焕的那十亩田，因为水灾没有收成，可是王焕一天中要来几次强逼着要租子，病着的妈妈没有办法，落着泪答应小妹作他家的丫头，才解决了这个问题。
    年老的爸爸要吃饭，病着的妈妈要吃药，我那儿有这样的办法呀！所以我只有天天发愁。由于日子的艰难，把爸爸饿的不能起床，妈妈的病也一天比一天重了，我加倍的劳苦，也不能赚得更多的钱，所以只有一天喝一顿稀饭。
    就在这个困难的时候，妈妈死了，同时爸爸也由于痛苦和饥饿病倒了，我怎么办呢？当时真没有主意，还是爸爸叫我去见王焕的。
    王焕平常对穷人的态度，使我禁不住的害怕，我的心便卜卜地跳起来，可是为了妈妈的死，爸爸的病，我不能不向那老家伙低头。
    话说来很奇怪，这次王焕对我是出奇的客气，他是笑迷迷地对我讲话，他对妈妈的死非常惋惜，对爸爸的病也非常同情，他借给了五块银圆和二斗粮食。
    我得了钱，得了粮，就如同鱼得到水一样，快活地回了家，爸爸见了也非常高兴，口里不住的地嘟念着王家的好处。这样，我把妈妈的丧办了，爸爸的病也见好转。再加上二斗粮的富裕，我才免掉了过分劳苦。
    在爸爸快要好的时候，小妹妹带了王焕给的食物回家来了一次，爸爸更加快活。可是在我送小妹出门口的时候，她对我哭了，她说王家对她不好。你说，我作哥哥的多么伤心呀！
    在爸爸好后两个月，王焕邀爸爸到他家里去。爸爸回来的时候显得非常难过，他苦苦地对我说，我家的住宅已经归王家所有了。爸爸由于这次打击，他又生病了，这次一病倒，不到两礼拜就死了。说起来我真寒心，为了给爸爸发丧，我又无可奈何的花了王焕的钱。
    王焕这个王八蛋，可恶可恨，他对我变了面色，硬逼着去给他作工，由工资抵销债务的利息，这样我一辈子将成他的奴才！
    千难万难的日子终久也有个尽头，八路军来到咱村，我可得救了！我受到　吴同志的指示，参加抗战，在政府的帮助之下，救出了小妹，也救活了老婆。
    日子过的真快，我打鬼子整整八年，胜利后，国民党反动派发动内战，我决心革命到底！
    在队伍里，我受到许多同志的爱护和指导，无时无地不在学习，不识字的我，现在已经能写家信和读书了。
    过去的战斗中，我是出生入死，由枪炮弹中爬了出来，身上受了好几处伤，所以我才当了班长。如今说来，我是被解放了。
    在这里我把张同志的话记下来，说明劳动人民的革命热情，并以纪念他的光荣的革命经历。
