　　【This newspaper's dispatch】 Broad masses of women in Gaoyang and other counties in the Ninth District of Central Hebei actively participate in agricultural and sideline production, greatly improving their economic and family status. In the Second and Fifth Districts of Gaoyang, women participating in production account for 50% of the total number of women; in the First, Third, Fourth, and Sixth Districts, they account for more than 80%. Small-scale production cooperatives have been organized relatively universally in various counties. In Beilou Village, First District of Anguo, eighty-five women have formed sixteen agricultural and sideline mutual aid groups. They spin thread during ordinary times and engage in field production during busy farming seasons.

　　In different seasons, women participate in various kinds of production the same way as men. During the wheat harvest season, they cut and pull wheat, drive carts, thresh grain, and also undertake all household labor. Last July, Anguo, Lixian, Boye, Dingxian, Wuji, and other counties generally suffered insect plagues. Under the leadership of village party branches and representative assemblies, the broad masses of women joined the wave of catching insects. In Zhao Guanzuo and Douwa villages in Gaoyang, 850 women participated in catching insects. In Beiloudi Village, Anguo, when the insect plague was severe, all the women in the village concentrated their efforts on catching insects for the military and local authorities, thus mitigating the insect plague. During the winter work, women participated in various sideline productions. According to incomplete statistics from twenty-two villages in Anguo, one hundred and seven sideline mutual aid groups were organized. In various productions, especially women from poor peasant families, their production enthusiasm has been significantly improved. At nineteen years old, Lan Xiucai from Dajiachuang Village in Xinle cultivates eleven mu of land by herself. Jin Xiaomei, a landlord's wife from Miaojiaying Village in Lixian who never participated in production, also began to learn to cultivate and hoe land under the influence of the peasants.

　　The weaving industry is relatively common in various counties, especially in Gaoyang, which is the most developed. Women participating in sideline handicraft industries account for about 90% of the total female population in the county. Gaoyang can weave 39,000 bolts of plain white cloth and more than 8,000 bolts of various floral striped cloth every month. The cloth and thread market in the city expanded twice as much last winter than in the spring. About 5,000 jin of thread were sold in each market. The weaving industry in various counties has also begun to develop in an organized direction. In thirty flood-stricken villages in the Fifth and Eighth Districts of Raoyang, a total of 819 women participated in weaving pockets, with 408 machines in operation, enabling them to overcome the disaster. Secondly, in Anping’s horsehair Luo industry, Anxin’s mat industry, the waterside’s weaving and fishing gear industry, and the arid land’s saltpeter, alkali, and flour mills, large numbers of women actively participate.

　　Although women in the entire district are playing a significant role on the production front and have a foundation for participating in production, it is still necessary to strengthen leadership, overcome the spontaneous phenomenon of women participating in production, and continue to develop cooperation and mutual assistance on the original basis, based on the principle of "voluntary mutual benefit," and carry out production competition movements. In various sideline productions, emphasis should be placed on improving product quality.

　　冀中高阳等县广大妇女
  　普遍参加农业副业生产
    【本报讯】冀中九分区高阳等县妇女，积极参加农、副业生产，经济和家庭地位大大提高。高阳二、五区参加生产的妇女，占妇女总数百分之五十；一、三、四、六区占百分之八十以上。各县比较普遍的组织了小型生产合作社。安国一区北楼村，八十五个妇女，组成十六个农、副业互助组。平时纺线，农忙时到田间生产。
    在不同季节里，妇女同男子一样的参加各种生产。麦秋割麦拔麦、赶车、轧场，还担负着一切家庭劳动。去年七月间，安国、蠡县、博野、定县、无极等县，普遍发生虫灾，广大妇女在村支部和代表会的领导下，卷入了捕虫热潮。高阳赵官佐斗洼两村，有八百五十个妇女参加捕虫。安国北楼底村，在虫灾严重时，全村妇女集中力量去给军地捕虫，因此虫灾得以减轻。冬季工作中，妇女们参加了各种副业生产。据安国廿二个村不完全的统计，组织起一百零七个副业互助组。在各种生产中，尤其是贫农家的妇女，生产情绪显著提高。新乐党家庄兰秀才十九岁，就自己耕种十一亩地。蠡县缪家营村一贯不参加生产的地主家的妇女晋小梅，在农民影响下，也开始学耕地锄地。
    各县纺织业比较普遍，特别是高阳最发达，全县参加副业手工业的妇女，约占全县妇女人口的百分之九十上下。高阳每月能织白布三万九千匹，各样花条布八千多匹。城内布线市在去年冬天比春天扩大了一倍，每集上线约五千多斤。各县纺织业，也开始向组织起来的方向发展。饶阳五、八区三十个水灾村，共有八百十九个妇女参加织口袋，四百零八张机子活动着，得以渡过灾荒。其次安平的马尾罗业、安新的席业、水乡的编织治鱼工具业、旱乡的硝业、硷业、粉坊……，都有广大妇女积极参加。
    全分区妇女，在生产战线上，虽起着很大作用和有了参加生产的基础。但还需要加强领导，克服妇女参加生产中的自流现象，在原有基础上，本着“自愿两利”的原则，继续发展合作互助，开展生产竞赛运动。在各种副业生产上，则应强调提高产品质量。
