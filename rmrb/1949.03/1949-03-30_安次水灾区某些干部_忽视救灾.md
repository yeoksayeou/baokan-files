　　Anci Flood Area Certain Cadres
　　Neglect Disaster Relief
　　[Jizhong News] Certain district and village cadres in the Anci flood area are neglecting to lead the masses in production and self-salvation. After the county party committee discovered this, it has instructed them to correct it. For example, in most villages in the Second District, the Yongding River water has now receded, but the district has not yet shifted its central work, and is still mobilizing the masses to solve land issues; in Xingguanying, a flood-stricken village in the Eleventh District, farmers urgently request loans for spring wheat seeds, but the district cadres are still busy organizing mass teams, and the masses' morale is very low. It is reported that the county is traversed by the Yongding River, and the river floods every year, causing disasters. When the Kuomintang reactionary bandits were in power, they even used "water instead of soldiers," deliberately breaching dikes and releasing water, turning one hundred and three villages into swamps, leaving the people without food or clothing. After liberation, our democratic government immediately prepared 90,000 jin of wheat seeds, ready for timely loans, and convened a meeting of farmer representatives from flood-stricken villages on the 7th of this month to fully discuss how to carry out production for self-salvation and seed loans. However, some districts, such as the Fourth, Seventh, Ninth, and Eleventh Districts, have made no progress in their work so far, nor have they reported to the county, seriously demonstrating indifference to the people's lives and production, as well as a lack of organization and discipline. Moreover, in the district and villages that have already started lending seeds, the following deviations have occurred: 1. The seed loan procedures are not strict: the sub-district introduces to the district, and the district introduces to the county, but there are no review opinions or detailed information about the lending households, making it impossible for the county to review, causing some villages to have to make several trips to complete the procedures, arousing dissatisfaction among the masses and village cadres. 2. Some village cadres are afraid of offending people and lend to anyone; but there are also those who resolutely refuse loans to disaster victims whose land is slightly more. 3. Village cadres have departmentalism: everyone wants their own village to borrow more, creating a tendency among the masses to simply rely on grain loans without thinking about other production methods. 4. There is coercion in organizing mutual aid groups. After discovering the above deviations, the county party committee, in addition to giving instructions for correction on the spot at a meeting of cadres in the Second District, also notified all flood-stricken areas in the county to immediately correct them, not to miss the farming season, carry out production for self-salvation, and rush to sow spring wheat.

### 安次水灾区某些干部　忽视救灾

　　安次水灾区某些干部
    忽视救灾
    【冀中讯】安次水灾区某些区村干部，忽视领导群众生产自救，县委发觉后，已指示纠正。如二区大部村庄，永定河水现已撤完，但区上尚未转变中心工作，仍发动群众，解决土地问题；十一区水灾村刑官营，农民迫切要求贷种种春麦，而区干部却仍忙于组织群众队伍，群众情绪很低。按该县为永定河所横穿，每年河水泛滥成灾，国民党反动匪徒们在时，更“以水代兵”，决口放水，一百零三个村庄尽为水泽，人民衣食无着。解放后，我民主政府即备好麦种九万斤，准备及时贷发，并于本月七日召开了水灾村农民代表会议，充分研讨了如何开展生产自救及贷种诸问题。但有的区如四、七、九、十一等区，至今工作毫未进展，也未向县作报告，严重地表现了对人民生活、生产漠不关心及无组织无纪律现象。且在已进行贷种之区村，也发生了如下偏向：一、贷种手续不严密：小区介绍到区，区介绍到县，都没有审查的意见和贷种户的详细情形，县里无法审查，致使某些村往返数次才能办好手续，引起群众和村干部的不满。二、有的村干部怕得罪人，谁贷也行；但也有因灾民的土地稍多便断然拒绝者。三、村干部的本位主义思想：谁也想自己的村多贷点，造成了群众的单纯依赖贷粮而不另想生产办法的偏向。四、在组织互助组时有强迫的现象发生。县委发现上述偏向后，除在二区的干部会议上当场给予指示纠正外，并通告全县各水灾区，应立即进行纠正，不误农时，开展生产自救，赶播春麦。
