Raoyang, Hejian and other places
Liberated peasants request to join the Party
[Report from this newspaper] In the process of land reform combined with Party rectification in various parts of central Hebei, the masses' awareness and the Party's prestige among the masses have been unprecedentedly enhanced. Liberated peasants in various places have requested to join the Communist Party one after another. In Raoyang, 221 outstanding poor peasant activists have joined the Party during the land reform; District One alone has 98. In seven villages in District One of Hejian, 38 people have requested to join the Party; 29 have already been approved. In Anguo, eight new Party members have been developed in Jun Shen Village, and five new members have been recruited in Renhe Fengyuanzhuang.

According to the local conditions, there are generally three ways for these new Party members to join the Party: One is to automatically raise the request to join the Party at the general meeting, and after the introduction by Party members, the Party general meeting approves, and after the approval of a certain Party committee, the individual goes through the formalities for joining the Party. The second is through individual introduction by village branch committee members and Party members, the Party general meeting approves, and after the approval of a certain Party committee, an admission ceremony is held to admit them into the Party. The third is that some active liberated peasants take the initiative to find district cadres of the work team and ask them to introduce them to the Party; then the district cadres introduce them to the village branch, which discusses it, introduces them with certain Party members, the Party general meeting approves, a certain Party committee approves, and an admission ceremony is held to individually admit them into the Party.

This group of new Party members has been educated and tested in the land reform movement, and their political awareness is generally high. For example, Liu Qingfu, a peasant representative (poor peasant) from Nanliuzhuang, Raoyang, said: "In the past, we were poor people exploited by others. After rent reduction and interest reduction, and land reform, we have now been liberated. I think the road led by the Communist Party is the only good one. I want to join the Communist Party and carry the revolution through to the end!" A newly admitted woman in Gaozhuang, District One of Hejian, repeatedly urged when writing about her motivation for joining the Party: "Write clearly for me: I didn't want to join the Party only after seeing Japan surrender and Chiang Kai-shek defeated; I come from a revolutionary family and have long known what the Communist Party does." When Tie Gang, a young man from Shuangta Village in Hejian, joined the Party, he first proposed: "I am willing to serve the people, and I will go wherever I am transferred."

### 饶阳河间等地　翻身农民纷纷请求入党

　　饶阳河间等地
  　翻身农民纷纷请求入党
    【本报讯】冀中各地在结束土地改革结合整党过程中，空前提高了群众觉悟和党在群众中的威信。各地翻身农民，纷纷请求加入共产党。饶阳在结束土地改革中，已经入党的优秀贫农积极分子有二百二十一人；仅一区就有九十八人。河间一区七个村，有三十八人要求入党；已经批准入党的有二十九人。安国军诜村新发展了八名党员，任河冯远庄新吸收五名。
    这批新党员入党的方式，根据各地情况，大体有三种：一种是大会上自动提出入党要求，经过党员介绍，党员大会通过，经一定的党委批准，然后个别的屡行入党手续。第二种是经村支部委员和党员个别介绍，党员大会通过，经一定党委批准，举行入党仪式吸收入党。第三种是有些积极的翻身农民，主动找到工作组的区干部，要求介绍入党；再由区干部介绍给村支部，经支部讨论，有一定党员的介绍，党员大会通过，一定党委批准，举行入党仪式个别吸收入党。
    这批新党员在土地改革运动中得到了教育和考验，政治觉悟一般都较高。例如饶阳南刘庄农民代表刘庆福（贫农）说：“早先咱是受人剥削的穷光蛋，经过减租减息、土地改革，现在翻身了；我看只有共产党领导的道路好，我要参加共产党，坚决革命到底！”河间一区高庄一个新入党的妇女，在写入党动机时，她再三嘱咐：“给我写清楚：我不是见到日本投降、蒋介石打败了才要入党的；我是革命家庭，早就知道共产党是干什么的。”河间双塔村青年铁刚在入党时先提出：“愿为人民服务，调到那里就去那里。”
