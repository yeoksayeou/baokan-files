　　From Slaves to Masters
  　Remembering the Liberated Miners of the Jingxing Coal Mine

    I visited many miners at the Xinjing Coal Mine, which is under the jurisdiction of the Jingxing Coal Mine. They made an appropriate conclusion about their past and present lives: "In the past, we were slaves; now, we are masters!" The following is their historically significant journey of liberation that they will never forget:
    I. The Life of Slaves
    During the rule of the Japanese invaders and Chiang Kai-shek's bandits, workers who entered the mine were treated like pigs, left to be slaughtered by the factory. The layers of exploitation by the chief contractors and subcontractors meant that workers who shed blood and sweat every day had at least 20% to 50% of their wages deducted. About 70% of the wages they actually received were paid in the form of bad millet, rotten beans, bean cakes, and radish slices. Many people died from diarrhea after eating bean cakes.
    Disease and death always followed the workers. As long as they had a breath left, the fierce coal supervisors or foremen would beat them with sticks to make them work underground, even if they were lying in the dark and damp ground, unable to move. As for sick livestock, the factory felt sorry for them because the death of livestock meant a loss of millions of yuan, while the death of a person only meant a few tens of thousands of yuan for coffin expenses. The workers said mournfully: "A person is not as valuable as a head of livestock!"
    Another vicious method used by the factory to slaughter workers was dark political rule. During the Japanese occupation, there were gendarmerie and labor research institutes (i.e., special agent organs) that specialized in detecting workers' thoughts and actions. If a worker said a wrong word, they would be regarded as a suspect and sent to the special agent organ for interrogation or torture. When Chiang Kai-shek's bandits ruled, the means of control became even more severe. The Party headquarters, the Three People's Principles Youth League, the Public Security Bureau, the mine police team, and secret agents closely monitored the workers' actions. Speaking with fellow villagers was regarded as "communicating with bandits," and casually speaking quietly to each other was regarded as "communicating with bandits." After the label of "communicating with bandits" was put on their heads, they would be detained in the Public Security Bureau and subjected to various tortures (branding irons, electric shocks, pouring cold water, etc.). Every day, the workers sold their strength and barely hoped for the end of work, but they had to go to work again immediately - the foremen's whips forced them to drill, stand guard, and dig trenches. They were simply like a non-stop windmill. In addition to drilling, standing guard, and digging trenches, the workers also had to donate money to buy guns, cannons, and bullets, and provide for the living expenses of the mine police team, saying that this was "defending the factory."
    II. Rising Up in Struggle Under Dark Rule
    Under all the dark rule of Chiang Kai-shek's bandits and the Japanese invaders, the workers came up with various ways to resist secretly. They implemented "go-slow," working a few strokes when the foreman's whip was on their heads, and slacking off after the foreman left. "Go-slow, eat foreign food, defecate at half past three," the workers used this method of resistance to deal with the factory. The factory always asked the workers to produce more coal, but the workers' response was to "load gangue" (putting the stones dug out of the coal seam into the coal) - at least one-third of the gangue was loaded into a can of coal (equivalent to 1,300 jin), greatly reducing the quality of the coal. Brave and outstanding workers such as Han Fengshan, Du Minglun, and Zhang Liangui, ignoring the enemy's strict surveillance, risked secretly organizing some workers and guerrillas from villages near the mine to establish an intelligence network, which gave the guerrillas many conveniences to attack the mine. Due to the activities of the guerrillas, the workers' confidence in the victory of the struggle was enhanced.
    III. A Bright and Happy Life Has Arrived
    On April 16, 1946, the Jingxing Coal Mine was liberated. The first slogan shouted by the workers of the Xinjing Coal Mine was "We see the light of day!" Indeed, the workers ended their dark past lives and began to see light and happiness. The first thing that satisfied the workers was that the factory abolished the cruel exploitation of the contracting system and implemented a reasonable wage system of "more work, more pay," so that every worker could get the wages they deserved. At the same time, in order to prevent the workers' wages from being affected by price fluctuations, the factory changed to calculating according to actual objects (millet) and set up a food cooperative to allow each worker to buy grain at a price lower than the market price. Now, even apprentices who earn the lowest wages (120 jin of rice per month) can eat their fill of millet rice every day, and sometimes they can also eat white flour, rice, and meat; workers who earn general wages (about 200 jin of rice per month) live even better. As a result, the workers' illnesses have also been greatly reduced. Eight or nine out of ten people who go to the clinic every day are temporarily breaking their fingers, and only one or two out of ten have internal medicine diseases. Not only can diseases be treated for free, but they can also get the necessary rest time. If they get sick due to work, they can still get their original wages during the rest period. The factory is very concerned about the workers working in dangerous areas underground and ordered the management personnel to take responsibility for protecting the safety of the workers (such as inspecting the coal holes or roadways every day for the danger of collapse or methane combustion). In addition, workers are often taught various knowledge of preventing dangers, so the death of workers is very rare, while in the dark rule of the enemy and puppet regime, at least one person died every day on average. Workers' deaths and injuries can receive compensation and relief. In the atmosphere of freedom and democracy, under the leadership of the trade union and the Communist Youth League, workers can carry out all kinds of beneficial activities, such as attending night school, reading newspapers, performing plays, singing, and publishing blackboard newspapers. Workers have been liberated economically and politically.
    IV. Showing the Spirit of Ownership to Restore the Mine
    Living in this free and happy environment, the workers have been able to deeply realize that the mine is their own, so the workers took out the spirit of ownership and a new labor attitude and actively engaged in the restoration and construction of the mine. At the beginning of the liberation, the Xinjing Coal Mine was destroyed by the war, the machines were incomplete, the equipment was in a mess, the houses collapsed, weeds were everywhere, and wild wolves haunted the area. The main coal-producing new well was flooded by water, and the water surged to the connected air shaft. The roadway of the air shaft (that is, the passageway for transporting coal and ventilating underground) was collapsed by the water. Under these circumstances, the general old employees believed that it was impossible to restore the mine. However, the workers carried out the restoration work with a high degree of class consciousness and full of labor enthusiasm. In the beginning, the old worker Yu Kechang (now the chairman of the Jingxing Mine General Trade Union) led fifteen experienced workers to bring their tools to repair the roadway on one side of the air shaft while producing coal. Because most of the roadway was collapsed by the water, it was difficult to repair it for a while, so that the ventilation was not smooth. The sultry air made people very uncomfortable, and in some places, even methane was burned (that is, a toxic gas emitted from coal, which can burn a thousand feet in one second, and people will be burned to death if they encounter this). It was very dangerous to produce coal, but the brave and excellent workers ignored everything and insisted on working, producing three cans of coal every day (each can is equivalent to 1,300 jin). A month later, the roadway was gradually repaired, the number of coal production places increased, and the number of workers increased to more than 40. The various departments of the mine (such as mechanical workers, electricians, fitters, riveters, power, woodworking, etc.) must be established on a scale to cope with the situation. However, the machines in each department were incomplete, lacking tools and raw materials, and could not be started. Under the factory's call for "everyone to find ways to overcome difficulties," the workers actively found ways to fight against the difficulties. Some workers voluntarily donated the tools and raw materials they had saved, such as chicken feather paper, rubber, screw handles, files, safety lamps, and raincoats; some workers searched and collected scattered machine parts in every corner of the mine every day and repaired and equipped them; some workers used waste materials to manufacture tools such as iron shovels, hoes, screws, and coal cans; some workers exerted their talents to create various substitutes, such as Zhang Muming of the power stock made an important raw material for machines - butter - from sesame oil, butter, and caustic soda; Liu Yinxi of the fitter stock made a lathe pliers from water steel instead of air steel; the power stock transformed a coal mining motor into a 15-horsepower electric winch; more importantly, the electromechanical department manufactured water tank cages instead of electric pumps that were damaged by water, so that the flooded new well could be drained in time, and coal could be produced soon. Therefore, in three or four months, the entire mine was revived in the roar of machines.
    Since July last year, the workers have been actively implementing the factory's call to "strive for industrialization." Strict systems such as meetings, reports, regular work and rest, rewards and punishments, and accountability for everything have been established; monthly production plans are made, and then studied and approved by the department affairs meeting to achieve accurate calculation, organized and planned production, and reduce non-production personnel to production, so that production has been greatly improved. In terms of underground production, in the past (before July), the highest monthly coal production was more than 14,000 tons, and the average daily coal production per person was at most 0.66 tons. Now (after July), the highest monthly coal production is 20,000 tons, and the average daily coal production per person reaches a maximum of 0.786 tons.

### 从奴隶到主人　记解放了的井陉煤矿矿工们

　　从奴隶到主人
  　记解放了的井陉煤矿矿工们
    我访问井陉煤矿所辖的新井煤矿的许多矿工，他们对于过去和现在的生活作了一个恰当的结论说：“过去是奴隶，现在是主人了！”下面就是他们永远不能忘记的具有历史意义的翻身经过：
    一、奴隶的生活
    在日寇、蒋匪统治时期，工人踏进矿厂的大门，就象猪一样任由厂方宰割。大包工、二包工的层层剥削，使工人每天流尽血汗，所应得的工资至少要扣去百分之二十至百分之五十，而真正到手的工资中又有百分之七十左右发给坏小米、烂豆子、豆饼、萝卜片等，有许多人吃豆饼拉肚死去了。
    疾病和死亡永远追随着工人们，只要还有一口气，凶恶的煤师或监工的棍子就打着他们下井工作，一直作到不能动弹躺在阴暗潮湿的地下也是没有人管的。至于牲口病倒厂方是怜惜的，因为牲口死了要损失几百万元，人死了最多化几十万元的棺材费。工人沉痛地说：“人不如一头牲口值钱！”
    厂方宰割工人的另一种毒辣手段，就是黑暗的政治统治。在日寇统治时期，有宪兵队和劳工研究所（即特务机关）等，专门检举工人的思想行动，工人说错一句话，就视为嫌疑分子，被送到特务机关拷问或受刑。到了蒋匪统治时期，统治的手段更加利害。党部、三青团、公安局、矿警队、密探等严密监视工人行动。同乡与同乡说话要以“通匪”论罪，两人随便悄悄说话要以“通匪”论罪。“通匪”的帽子扣到头上后，要关在公安局受各种酷刑（烙铁、过电、灌凉水等）。每天，工人卖尽气力好容易盼望下工到来，但是马上又要上工——监工的皮鞭逼迫着他们上操、站岗、挑壕挖沟，他们简直象一辆不停的风车。工人们除上操、站岗、挑沟之外，还要捐出购买枪炮子弹费及供给矿警队的生活费，说这是“保卫工厂”。
    二、在黑暗统治下奋起斗争
    在蒋匪日寇的一切黑暗统治下，工人们想出各种办法暗中抵抗。他们实行“磨洋工”，当监工的鞭子逼在他们头上时，他们就工作几下，监工走后，又松劲了。“磨洋工，吃洋饭，拉屎拉了三点半”，工人是用这样的抵抗方法去对付厂方的。厂方总是要求工人多多出煤，但是工人给他的答复是“装矸子”（把煤层中刨出的石头夹在煤中）——一罐煤（合一千三百斤）至少装三分之一的矸子，大大降低了煤的质量。勇敢优秀的工人韩凤山、杜明伦、张连贵等，更不顾敌伪的严密监视，冒着危险秘密组织部分工人与矿厂附近村庄的游击队，建立情报网，给了游击队袭击矿厂的许多便利，由于游击队的活动，提高了工人斗争的胜利信心。
    三、光明幸福的生活到来了
    一九四六年四月十六日，井陉煤矿解放了，新井煤矿的工人喊出第一句口号就是“见到青天了！”的确，工人结束了过去黑暗的生活，开始看到了光明与幸福。工人首先感到满意的，就是厂方废除了残酷剥削的包工制，实行“多劳多得”的合理的工资制，使每个工人都能得到应得的工资。同时厂方为使工人的工资不致受物价波动而吃亏，改为照实物（小米）计算，并专设伙食合作社，使每个工人都能买到低于市价的粮食。现在，即使获得最低工资的学徒（每月一百廿斤米），每天都能吃饱小米饭，有时还能吃到白面、大米、肉类；获得一般工资的工人（每月约二百余斤米）生活就更好。由于这样，工人的疾病也就大大减少。每天到医务所看病的人有十分之八九是临时碰破手指头之类的，只有十分之一、二才是内科病。疾病不仅可以得到免费治疗，并能得到必须休养的时间，如因工作致病还在休养期间拿到原来的工资。厂方对于在井下危险地带工作的工人是非常关心的，责成管理人员必须负起保护工人安全的责任（如每天巡视煤洞或巷道有无倒塌或沼气燃烧的危险），另外经常教给工人预防危险的各种知识，因此工人的死亡是很少的，而在敌伪黑暗统治时，则平均每天至少死一个人。工人死伤，可以得到抚恤和救济。在自由民主的空气里，在职工会、青年团的领导下，工人可以进行一切有益的活动，如进夜校、读报、演剧、唱歌、出黑板报等。工人从经济上、政治上都获得了解放。
    四、拿出主人翁气概恢复矿厂
    工人处在这个自由幸福的环境里，已经能深刻体会到矿厂就是工人自己的，因此工人拿出主人翁的气概和新的劳动态度，积极从事于矿厂的恢复建设工作。当解放之初，新井煤矿因战争摧毁，机器残缺不全，器材狼籍，房屋倒塌，蒿草遍地，野狼出没，主要出煤的新井为水所淹，水涌至相连的风井，风井的巷道（即井下运煤及通风的夹道），为水冲塌。在这种情形下，一般旧职员对于恢复矿厂都认为是不可能的事情。但是工人以高度的阶级觉悟和满腔的劳动热忱进行恢复工作。开始，老工人余克昌（现为井陉矿总工会主任）领导了十五个有经验的工人自动带来工具，在风井一边修理巷道，一边出煤。由于巷道大部为水冲塌，一时难于修复，以致风气不能畅通，闷热的空气使人非常难受，有的地方甚至沼气燃烧（即煤炭中发出的一种有毒气体，一秒钟可燃烧一千尺，遇此则被烧死），出煤是很危险的，但是勇敢优秀的工人不顾一切，坚持工作，每天出煤三罐（每罐合一千三百斤）。一月以后，巷道逐渐修复，出煤的地方增加，工人增至四十余人，矿厂各部门（如机工、电工、钳工、铆工、动力、木工等股）必须建立规模才能应付局面了，但是，各部门的机器都残缺不全，缺乏工具、原料，无法发动。在厂方号召“大家想办法克服困难”下，工人都踊跃设法与困难作斗争。有的工人自动献出曾经保存的工具和原料，如鸡毛纸、胶皮、螺丝把、锉力、安全灯、雨衣等；有的工人每天在矿厂各个角落找觅和收拾失散的机器零件，加以修理配备，有的工人利用废料制造铁铣、镐、螺丝、煤罐等工具；有的工人发挥天才，创造各种代用品，如动力股的张目铭以大麻油、牛油及火碱制成机器用的重要原料——黄油；钳工股的刘银喜以水钢代替风钢，制成车床钳子；动力股以采煤电动机改造成十五马力的电绞车；更重要的是机电科制造水罐笼代替为水淹坏的电泵，使被淹的新井得以及时排水，不久即能出煤。于是，三、四个月之间，整个矿厂又在机声隆隆中复活起来了。
    自去年七月起，工人又积极实现厂方“为企业化而努力”的号召。严格建立了会议、汇报，按时作息，奖励惩罚及凡事追究责任等制度；按月作出生产计划，再由科务会议研究批准，做到精确计算，有组织有计划的进行生产，并减缩非生产人员到生产中去，这样生产便大大提高，以井下生产而言，过去（七月以前）每月产煤最高一万四千余吨，每人每日平均产煤最高效率零点六六吨，现在（七月以后）每月产煤最高二万吨，每人每日平均产煤最高效率达零点七八六吨。
