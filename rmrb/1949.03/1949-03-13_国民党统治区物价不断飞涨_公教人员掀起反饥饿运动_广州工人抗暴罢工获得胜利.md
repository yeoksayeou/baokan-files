Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 11th -- Prices in the Kuomintang-controlled areas continue to skyrocket. Taking Shanghai as an example, the price of rice reached a peak of 28,000 yuan per shi (unit of dry measure) in pseudo-gold yuan on the 7th of this month. This is a 1.33-fold increase compared to when the Kuomintang pseudo-government announced "financial and economic reforms" twelve days ago, and a more than 1,450-fold increase compared to August 19th of last year when the "currency reform" was implemented.

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 11th -- Under the heavy pressure of soaring prices, public employees in various Kuomintang-controlled areas have launched an anti-hunger movement. From late last month to the beginning of this month, Chengdu, Taiyuan, Shanghai, Hangzhou, Kunming, Guilin, Hankou and other places have been involved in the struggle. As the economic collapse of the Kuomintang reactionary government accelerates and inflation continues to expand, the lives of public employees in the Kuomintang areas have fallen into desperate straits. For example, the price level in Kunming is now 1,350 times that of August 19th last year when the "currency reform" was implemented, but the Kuomintang government pays salaries based on an index of 50 times, and the actual income of public employees has been reduced to less than 4 percent of the level of last August. Under similar circumstances, the actual income of public employees in the Guilin area is less than 5 percent. In Hankou, the monthly income of senior civil servants is less than 6 silver dollars, and that of recommended and appointed grades is less than 4 yuan, which cannot even maintain personal food and clothing, let alone support a family. In Taiyuan, a civil servant's monthly salary is not even enough for ten days of food. This has forced public employees in various Kuomintang areas to rise up and demand improved treatment. They oppose continuing to pay salaries with worthless pseudo-gold yuan and demand that they be paid in kind. Civil servants of the pseudo-Fujian Provincial Government held a "Lifesaving Association" on the 4th of this month, deciding to send a telegram to the whole country, calling on public employees in the Kuomintang-controlled areas to rise up together to fight for improved treatment.

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 10th -- Guangzhou public bus workers held a strike on the 7th to protest the Kuomintang military police's unreasonable killing of a worker. On that day, Kuomintang military police officers took a bus at the Dashatou station in the city, refused to pay the fare, and dragged the bus staff who asked them for the fare to the nearby military police station, where they were severely beaten and injured. The striking workers demanded that the Kuomintang authorities punish the murderers and treat the injured. The strike lasted until the afternoon of the 8th, when the Kuomintang authorities were forced to agree to the workers' demands, and the workers began to return to work. However, the workers also announced that if the Kuomintang authorities do not fulfill the agreement within three days, they will continue the strike.

　　国民党统治区物价不断飞涨
    公教人员掀起反饥饿运动
    广州工人抗暴罢工获得胜利
    【新华社陕北十一日电】国民党统治区物价暴涨不已，以上海为例：本月七日大米每市石已达到伪金圆券二万八千元高峰，与十二天以前国民党伪政府宣布“财政经济改革”时比较已上涨一·三三倍，与去年八月十九日“币改”时比较则已上涨一千四百五十余倍。
    【新华社陕北十一日电】在物价飞涨的重压下，国民党统治区各地公教人员又掀起了反饥饿运动。自上月下旬至本月初，已有成都、太原、上海、杭州、昆明、桂林、汉口等地卷入斗争。由于国民党反动政府的经济崩溃加速，通货膨胀继续扩大，国民党区公教人员的生活已陷于绝境，例如昆明物价水平已为去年八月十九日“币改”时的一千三百五十倍，但国民党政府则按五十倍指数发薪，公教人员的实际收入已降低为不足去年八月水平的百分之四。在同样情况下，桂林区公教人员实际收入已不足百分之五。在汉口，简任级的公务员全月收入已不足银元六元，荐任及委任级不足四元，个人温饱都不能维持，根本谈不到养家。在太原，公务员全月薪水还不足十天的食用。这就迫使国民党区各地公教人员纷纷起而要求改善待遇。他们反对继续以一钱不值的伪金圆券发薪，而要求改发实物。福建伪省政府的公务员于本月四日召开“救命会”，决定通电全国，号召国民党统治区公教人员一齐起来为改善待遇而斗争。
    【新华社陕北十日电】广州公共汽车工人为抗议国民党宪兵无理凶杀工人，于七日举行罢工。是日国民党宪兵在该市大沙头车站乘坐汽车，拒付车资，并将向其索取车资之车上职工拉至附近宪兵站毒打重伤。罢工工人向国民党当局提出惩办凶手、医治伤者等要求。罢工坚持至八日下午，国民党当局被迫答应工人的要求，工人开始复工。但工人同时宣布如国民党当局三日内无履行协议之事实表现，将继续罢工。
