　　Disease Transmission and Prevention (Continued)
    Yin Xipeng
    3. Food Transmission Prevention Methods: Those who serve infectious patients should wash their hands frequently, especially before meals, and should be thoroughly disinfected (wash and then rub with spirits). Leftover food, fruits, and pastries from patients must never be eaten. Eating bowls and chopsticks should be separated from the patient's and not used in common. Food must be cooked thoroughly, and raw and spoiled foods should not be eaten. Cover food with gauze or keep it in a food safe to prevent flies from crawling on it. Cover melons, fruits, snacks, and sweets with glass or gauze covers to prevent contamination. Wild vegetables eaten raw must be disinfected. The methods are as follows:
    (1) Boiling Disinfection: Soak in boiling water for three to four seconds.
    (2) Bleaching Powder Disinfection: Prepare 3.75 grams of bleaching powder (approximately one Chinese matchbox), dissolve it in a glass wine bottle, seal the bottle tightly, and store it in a cool, dark place. When using, take one-fifth of the clear liquid and add it to about half a bucket of clean water (a regular wooden water bucket) and stir thoroughly. Soak the vegetables in it, wash them thoroughly, soak for half an hour to an hour, then take them out and wash them with clean water again.
    4. Soil Transmission Prevention Method: Farmers habitually pinch a handful of soil to stop bleeding when they break their skin, which is very dangerous! They don't know that tetanus bacteria specifically breed in the soil, especially in soil that is not often moved and in horse manure. Getting it into a wound can transmit tetanus. This bad habit must be changed!
    It is best to have a doctor deliver babies. Village midwives (or birth attendants) should thoroughly wash their hands beforehand and rub them with spirits before delivering. Scissors for cutting the umbilical cord should be boiled in boiling water. Do not use rags or rotten cotton to wrap the baby and handle the postpartum woman's private parts. If it is absolutely necessary to use them, steam or boil them first. Even if new ones are used, they must be steamed or boiled beforehand to prevent the baby from getting "tetanus neonatorum" and the mother from "puerperal fever"!
    5. Carrier Transmission Prevention Method: During outbreaks of diphtheria or typhoid fever, it is necessary to investigate those who have been in direct or indirect contact with diphtheria patients. The investigation method is to ask a doctor to check if these people have diphtheria bacteria in their throats. People who have just recovered from typhoid fever should have their stool checked for typhoid bacteria. If it is found that they are carriers, they should be controlled and treated, and temporarily not allowed to associate with others to avoid infecting them!
    6. Insect Transmission Prevention Method:
    (1) Eliminating Flies: 1. Eliminate larvae. Flies turn from larvae. To eliminate flies, you must first eliminate larvae. Larvae occur in toilets, garbage, cattle sheds, and decaying things, so to eliminate larvae, you must not pile up dirty things, bury feces and urine, often use soil to pad cattle sheds, and clean the yards and houses. Kerosene or kerosene mixed with water, shaken into an opaque substance, or lime powder can be used to kill larvae by scattering. 2. Preventing Flies. Cover food, bowls, chopsticks, basins, and spoons with cloth or place them in a tightly sealed food safe to prevent flies from entering. Kitchen doors and windows should have bamboo or reed curtains, and windows should be covered with gauze or wire mesh. The interior should be extremely clean. Toilets should have doors and windows. The toilet opening should be covered, and covered well after use. The deeper the toilets and cesspools in the countryside, the better, because the depths are cool and dark, unsuitable for flies to live in. Cover with a layer of ash and soil after defecation. 3. There are many methods of catching flies, such as flypaper, fly traps, insecticides (DDT, Fly Death are available at pharmacies, and garlic roots can also be used) or swatting with fly swatters. Fly catching is most effective in early spring.
    (2) Eliminating Mosquitoes: Mosquitoes lay eggs in water, and larvae grow in water. Ponds, ditches, puddles after rain, and stagnant water in empty cans—wherever there is standing water, they can develop.
    The larvae of mosquitoes that transmit malaria mostly live in relatively clear, slow-moving water. They are most suitable in ponds with growing aquatic plants, riverbanks, and shallow, waveless areas.
    Removing Larvae: (A) Spreading Oils: Spread kerosene or other turbid substances in the above-mentioned water. (B) Clearing Stagnant Water: Dredging stagnant water and filling in depressions. (C) Raising Fish in Ponds: Eating larvae.
    Repelling Mosquitoes: Burn mosquito coils, wormwood ropes, or rice husks before going to bed to smoke out mosquitoes. Or install screen windows and bamboo curtains, and use mosquito nets for sleeping to prevent mosquito bites.
    (3) Eliminating Fleas, Lice, and Bedbugs:
    Fleas, lice, and bedbugs all live by sucking human and animal blood. Fleas do not like places that can be exposed to the sun and prefer seams in mats, cracks, the ground, and corners of walls, especially places where dust accumulates. There are three types of lice: head lice, body lice, and pubic lice. Among them, body lice are the vectors of infectious diseases. Bedbugs hide during the day in cracks in beds, floors, walls, pillars, furniture, and ceilings.
    Methods for eliminating these insects:
    1. Maintaining Cleanliness: Regularly washing and changing clothes will easily eliminate body lice. Regularly sunning bedding and mats and cleaning the house, not piling up dirty soil, and filling in cracks in beds and floors.
    2. Heating to Eliminate: Soaking undershirts in boiling water can remove body lice; regularly sunning bedding is also a way to eliminate fleas with heat.
    3. Using Gas to Eliminate: Place sulfur (two taels of sulfur for every three feet in height, width, and length, and so on) in a ceramic plate or broken bowl, add alcohol and ignite it, close the doors and windows tightly, put up mats, and arrange bed boards. After four hours, open the doors and windows to ventilate, and fleas, lice, and bedbugs can be smoked to death. Only insect eggs cannot be killed. An interval of five to seven days is needed, and three to four consecutive treatments are necessary.
    4. Eliminating with Other Medications: (1) Head lice and body lice can be killed with mercury ointment, corrosive sublimate solution, or acetic acid (sold in pharmacies). (2) Volatile oil, turpentine, kerosene, and DDT water are best for fleas and bedbugs. Camphor oil and mothballs can also be used.
    (6) Rat Transmission Prevention: In addition to carrying fleas and spreading plague, rats can also spread bacteria into food, causing illness. Elimination methods:
    (1) Hide food well, and remove food scraps at any time, so that rats cannot find anything to eat and there will be no rats.
    (2) Block the rat holes in the house to prevent them from entering.
    (3) It is best to keep a cat.
    (4) Use rodenticides, with arsenic, arsenous acid, and barium carbonate being the best. Strychnine and phosphorus are also effective, but they are also harmful to humans and should be used with caution when using large quantities. Barium carbonate (sold in pharmacies) is less dangerous to humans and is best used.
    How to Use: Mix barium carbonate with four times the amount of flour, then add lard or broth to make balls the size of a thumb. Scatter them in places where rats often go, and they will die after eating them.

　　疾病的传染和预防（续完）
    殷希彭
    三、食物传染预防法：服侍传染病人的人，经常要洗手，特别在吃饭以前，应充分消毒（洗后再用烧酒擦擦）。病人剩下的饭和果、饼、绝对不能吃。吃饭碗筷和病人分开，不许通用。吃的东西一定煮熟，不吃生东西和腐败东西。食品用纱布盖起，或关在纱厨里，莫叫苍蝇去爬。瓜、果、点心、糖用玻璃罩成纱罩罩上，以免粘染病菌。野菜生吃一定要消毒，其法如下：
    （一）煮沸消毒：泡在沸水中三至四秒即可。
    （二）漂白粉消毒：预用漂白粉三·七五瓦（约当中国洋火盒一盒），溶化在玻璃酒瓶里，密闭瓶口，存在冷暗的地方。用时取澄清的清水五分之一，加清水约半桶（普通用打水的木桶）充分搅拌均匀，把青菜泡上，充分洗濯，泡半点到一点钟，取出再用净水洗净即可。
    四、泥土传染预防法：弄破了皮肤，农民们习惯捏上撮土止血，这是非常危险的！不知道破伤风菌专滋生在土里，特别是不常动的土和马粪里，弄到伤口上，就会传染破伤风。这种不好的习惯，一定要改变！
    生小孩最好请医生接生。乡村的收生婆（或叫接生姥姥），事先应该充分洗手，并用烧酒擦了再接生。剪脐带的剪刀要用开水煮过。包小孩和处理产妇阴部，不要用破布烂棉花，非用不可的时候，可先蒸过或煮过，就是用新的也得事先蒸、煮，以防小孩得“四六风”，产妇“节间病”（产褥热）的危险！
    五、带菌人传染预防法：在白喉或伤寒病流行的时候，要侦察和白喉病人直接或间接接近的人，侦察方法就是请医生检查这些人的喉咙里是不是有白喉菌。患伤寒刚好的人，要检查他大便里有没有伤寒菌。若查出来他是个带菌人，就应该管制、治疗，暂时不准他和别人往来，免得传染别人！
    六、昆虫传染预防法：
    （一）驱除苍蝇：１、灭蛆。蝇是蛆变的，要灭蝇必先灭蛆、蛆发生在厕所，垃圾、牛棚、腐败的东西里，所以要灭蛆就要不堆脏东西，掩埋粪尿，常用土垫牛棚，院内住屋打扫清洁。杀蛆用煤油或煤油加水，振荡成不透明的东西，或用石灰粉撒布。２、防蝇。食品、碗、筷、盆、勺用布盖好，或放在纱厨密闭，以妨蝇侵入。厨房门窗应挂竹帘或苇帘，窗糊纱布或铁丝纱。内部要极端清洁。厕所安门窗。便口应加盖，便后盖好。农村的厕所和粪坑，愈深愈好，因坑深则下面阴凉、黑暗，不适合苍蝇的生活。大便后盖一层灰、土。三、捕蝇方法很多，如粘蝇纸，捕蝇笼、杀蝇药（狄狄梯，蝇必立死各西药房有出售，此外山蒜根亦可）或用蝇拍子扑打。捕蝇以春初施行最有效果。
    （二）驱除蚊虫：蚊下蛋在水里，幼虫在水里生长，凡池塘，水沟，雨后水坑、空罐中的潴水无论什么地方，只要积水，它就可以发育。
    传疟疾的蚊子，幼虫多生在比较清的、流的慢的水里，在生长水草的水池、河边、浅而没有波浪的地方，是它最合适的地方。
    除幼虫：（甲）撒布油类，在上述的水里撒布煤油或其他的浊。（乙）疏通积水，填埋洼地。（丙）池塘养鱼，吃掉幼虫。
    驱蚊：临睡燃点蚊香、蒿草绳或谷糠，熏除蚊虫。或装置纱窗竹帘，睡眠使用蚊帐，防御蚊咬。
    （三）驱除蚤、虱、臭虫：
    蚤、虱、臭虫都靠吸人、畜血液生活。蚤不喜欢在能晒到太阳的地方，好在席子缝、坑缝、地面、墙角，特别是尘埃堆积的地方。虱有头虱，衣虱，毛虱三种，其中为传染病媒介的是衣虱。臭虫白天藏在床、坑、墙、柱、家具、顶棚等缝隙里。
    这些昆虫的驱除法：
    一、保持清洁：身体衣服常洗常换，衣虱就容易驱除。被褥席毡，常晒日光，屋内打扫清洁，不堆脏土，填塞床炕缝隙。
    二、加热驱除：用开水泡衬衣，可除衣虱；常晒被褥亦是以热除蚤的一种。
    三、用气体驱除：将硫黄（高宽长各三尺的地方，用硫黄二两，以此类推）放在磁盘或破碗里加酒精点火，把窗门闭紧，竖起席子，床板排开，经过四点钟，开门通风，蚤虱臭虫可以熏死。只有虫蛋杀不死，要再过五至七天的间隔，连行三至四次才行。
    四、其他药品驱除：（一）头虱、衣虱用水银软膏、升汞水、醋酸（药房出售）可以杀灭。（二）蚤、臭虫用挥发油、松节油、煤油、狄狄梯水为最好。樟脑油，臭球亦可用。
    （六）鼠传染的预防：老鼠除身带跳蚤，传染鼠疫以外，更能散布细菌到食物里惹人生病。驱除法：
    （一）很好的藏起吃的东西，食物残渣随时清除出去，使鼠找不到东西吃，就不会有老鼠了。
    （二）堵塞屋里的老鼠洞孔，使它进不来。
    （三）养猫最好。
    （四）使用杀鼠药，以砒霜、亚砒酸、炭酸钡为最好，马前子、磷均有效，惟对人体也有害，大量用的时候应注意。炭酸钡（西药房出售）对人危险小，用它最好。
    用法：将炭酸钡混上四倍的面粉，再加猪油或肉汤，作成姆指头大的球饼，散在老鼠常到的地方，它吃了就死。
