　　Production for Self-Relief—This is a slogan used by the Communist Party and the democratic government to lead the people in disaster areas to overcome famine. When many villages in the North China Liberated Area encountered drought and locust plagues in 1943, the government did not simply provide relief. Instead, it adopted methods such as providing grain and loans, while organizing disaster victims for production. Men were engaged in transportation and various handicraft side-line productions, while women spun yarn and wove cloth, using the peasants' own strength, coupled with government support, to overcome the disaster. Subsequently, in newly liberated areas ravaged by Chiang Kai-shek's bandits, or in areas hit by natural disasters, the government also used the same methods to organize peasants to overcome difficulties.
　　Sub-district—Within the scope of a district government below the county level, based on the number of villages in the district, natural features, and the needs of the masses, in order to facilitate leadership, several units are divided based on four or five villages, and this unit is called a sub-district. In some places, farmers themselves elect sub-district farmers' association committees or other mass organizations to assist the district-level Party and government in carrying out various tasks; in others, the district-level Party and government and mass organizations send staff members to be directly responsible for the work of the sub-district. It is not an administrative organization.
　　Departmentalism (Localism)—In dealing with all issues, one can only consistently see the interests of one's own unit or organization, turning a blind eye to the interests of the entire people and the collective interests, and even undermining the collective interests for the sake of one's own unit. Only by opposing such departmentalist thinking and behavior can the collective interests be guaranteed.

    生产自救—是共产党与民主政府领导灾区人民渡荒的一个口号。当一九四三年华北解放区不少农村遇到旱灾、蝗灾时，政府并不只是救济一下了事，而采取贷粮、贷款的方式，同时组织灾民生产，男人运输及进行各种手工副业生产，女人纺线织布，以农民自己的力量加上政府的扶植，来战胜灾荒。此后在遭受蒋匪摧残的新解放区，或天灾地区，政府亦用同样方式，组织农民渡过困难。
    小区—在县以下的区政府范围以内，根据区的村庄多少、自然形式和群众需要，为了便于领导，以四、五村庄不等划分为若干单位，此单位即称做小区。有的地方，农民自己选出小区农会委员会或其他群众组织，协助区级党与政府进行各种工作；有的则由区级党与政府及群众团体派出工作人员，直接负责该小区工作。她并不是一级行政组织。
    本位主义—处理一切问题，一贯地只能看到本单位、本团体的利益，对于整个人民的利益与集体的利益则熟视无睹，甚至为了本单位的利益去破坏集体的利益，只有反对了这种本位思想行为，集体的利益才有保证。
