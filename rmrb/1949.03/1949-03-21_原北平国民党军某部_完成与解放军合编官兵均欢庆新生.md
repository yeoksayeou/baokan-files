(Beiping News) The former Kuomintang army in Beiping, now reorganized into the People's Liberation Army, recognizing their bright future, have been actively requesting integration with the PLA and the establishment of the same excellent systems as the PLA, in order to become a people's army in name and in fact. The entire officers and soldiers of seven battalions directly under the former Kuomintang 101st Army, after arriving at the PLA unit's garrison, wrote to the leaders of the unit, requesting swift integration in order to learn the glorious traditions and excellent work style of the People's Army. Based on this request, the PLA unit immediately convened a meeting of cadres above the company level from both sides. According to the types of arms and nature of both units, they jointly studied the integration methods, resulting in a satisfactory outcome. After the integration, many officers reflected: "The Communist Party does what it says, the lower levels implement the regulations of the upper levels without any changes, and there is complete consistency in front of and behind people, this is the first time I have seen this in my life." Some said: "When I came to the reception center and received a warm welcome, I felt even more ashamed of participating in the anti-people war in the past. In the future, I must work hard to serve the people to atone for my previous sins." After watching the "Two Work Styles" performance by the propaganda team of a PLA unit, many soldiers of the Independent 41st Division (formerly the Kuomintang 272nd Division) surrounded the comrades of the propaganda team and said: "Your play is really good!" "Our officers used to beat or scold us, but now that we have been reorganized, they have to change too!" The officers and soldiers of the Independent 48th Division (formerly the Kuomintang 299th Division) and the Independent 88th Division (formerly the Kuomintang 311th Division), due to the warm welcome from the PLA and the people after the reorganization, many soldiers said with emotion: "From now on, being a soldier is truly worthwhile, I have never been so honored before." Encouraged by this emotion, the soldiers happily joined the PLA's propaganda workers in dancing the Yangko dance, enthusiastically talking and celebrating their new life. They also requested the PLA to send more cadres to lead them in establishing the various excellent systems of the PLA. When they saw the propaganda workers diligently sweeping the streets and carrying water for the residents, they quickly swept several streets in the garrison village clean. At the symposium of soldier representatives and officers, they also raised the urgent need to study revolutionary principles.

　　原北平国民党军某部
    完成与解放军合编官兵均欢庆新生
    【北平讯】已改编为人民解放军的原北平国民党军队，认识了自己的光明前途，纷纷要求和解放军合编，并建立与解放军同样的各种优良制度，以便成为名符其实的人民军队。原国民党军一○一军直属七个营的全体官兵，到达解放军某部驻地两天后，纷纷上书该部首长，要求迅予合编，以便学习人民军队的光荣传统与优良作风。该部根据这个要求，当即召开了双方连以上的干部会议。按照双方部队的兵种和性质。共同研究了合编方法，使合编得到圆满结果。合编后，许多官佐反映：“共产党说到那里，做到那里，上级的规定下级丝毫不变，当面背后完全一致，这是我有生以来第一次见到。”有的说：“当我来到招待所，受到热情的招待时，使我愈发感觉过去参加反人民战争的惭愧，今后定当努力为人民服务，以赎前罪。”独立第四十一师（原国民党军二七二师）的士兵们看了解放军某部宣传队演出的“两种作风”后，许多士兵围着宣传队的同志说：“你们演的戏真好！”“我们的官长早先待兄弟不是打就是骂，这回改编了，他也得改变了！”独立第四十八师（原国民党军二九九师）及独立第八十八师（原国民党三一一师）的官兵，由于改编后受到解放军和人民的热烈欢迎，许多士兵都感慨的说出：“从现在起，当这个兵才是真正值得的，过去从来没有这样光荣过一天。”士兵们在这种情绪鼓舞下，高兴得和解放军的宣传员们一同扭起秧歌来，热情的交谈着，欢庆自己的新生。并要求解放军多派干部去领导他们建立解放军里的各种优良制度。当他们看到宣传员们勤劳的给驻地居民扫地担水时，自己也迅速的把驻村几条街道扫得干干净净。在士兵代表与军官的座谈会上，他们并提出需要学习革命道理的迫切要求。
