　　North China People's Government Regulations
  　Registration and Management Measures for Returning Personnel
    [This Newspaper] The North China People's Government instructed governments at all levels on March 7 that returning personnel from cities such as Beiping and Tianjin after liberation (including students, staff, refugees, public employees, fleeing landlords, and disbanded prisoners of war from scattered soldiers) should be dealt with separately to maintain social order. The instruction stated: Those who abide by the laws and decrees of the People's Government and live in peace and engage in production will be protected by the government. Impoverished laborers and young students willing to serve the people can be helped. Those Kuomintang special agents who take the opportunity to infiltrate and continue to carry out sabotage activities should be severely punished. To this end, the following measures for the registration and management of returning personnel are hereby stipulated:
一、All returning personnel must, within ten days of arriving at their original village (town), register with the district government through the introduction of the village (town) people's government.
二、Special agents among the returning personnel, Kuomintang, Three People's Principles Youth League and other reactionary organizations above the district level, in addition to fulfilling the registration in Article 1, must also register with the county public security bureau through the introduction of the district government. They must declare that they have completely severed ties with the original reactionary organization since registration, repent and rehabilitate themselves, earnestly abide by the laws and decrees of the People's Government, and live in peace and engage in production.
三、Returning personnel registered under Article 2 must hand over all certificates, documents, weapons, ammunition, and other prohibited items held by reactionary organizations, and truthfully report any concealment elsewhere or transfer to others for investigation.
四、All returning personnel who register within the time limit and faithfully fulfill the provisions of the preceding three articles will be protected by the government if they are ordinary people; if they are returning personnel under Article 2, they may also be treated leniently based on the specific circumstances.
五、All returning personnel who violate the provisions of Articles 1 to 3 will be severely punished according to the law once verified, based on the actual situation.
六、People from all walks of life have the responsibility to report returning personnel who violate the provisions of Articles 1 to 3. If the report is verified to be true, the informant will be given a reward as appropriate.
