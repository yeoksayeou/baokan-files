　　Water Company
    Older Employees Who Never Studied Before Voluntarily Join Study Groups
    [Reported by this newspaper] The employees of Ping City Water Company and its three water plants, Dongzhimen, Andingmen, and Xijiao, have organized thirty-eight study groups and three literacy classes, actively engaging in learning. Some older employees who have worked in the company for more than twenty years, knowing only to go to work and get off work, and had no habit of studying, also voluntarily signed up to join study groups. After the comrades of the work team patiently explained and guided them in an enlightening way, their interest in learning was further enhanced. The workers participating in the literacy class are in the highest spirits. Ma Zuo, a 57-year-old craftsman from Shuicun, wearing reading glasses, enthusiastically said to the comrades of the work team: "As long as you teach every day, I guarantee to come to study on time every day and learn to read the newspaper within two years."

　　自来水公司
    一向不学习的老职员  也自动加入学习小组
    【本报讯】平市自来水公司及其所属的东直门、安定门、西郊三个水厂的职工，组织了三十八个学习小组及三个识字班，积极进行学习。过去在公司里工作了二十多年，只知上班下班，根本没有学习习惯的一些老职员，也自动签名加入学习小组。经过工作组同志用启发方式耐心讲解诱导，更提高了他们的学习兴趣。参加识字班的工人情绪最高，水村五十七岁的老工匠马佐着老花眼镜，热情的对工作组同志说：“只要你们天天教，我保证天天准时来学，在两年内要学会看报”。
