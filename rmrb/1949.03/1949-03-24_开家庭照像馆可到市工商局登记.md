　　Opening a Family Photo Studio
    Can Be Registered at the Municipal Administration for Industry and Commerce
    Ms. Xia Ge: If you want to open a family photo studio, you still need to go through the procedures, but it is very simple. You can ask the district people's government for an introduction letter and apply directly to the Municipal Administration for Industry and Commerce for registration to obtain a business license. You can officially open for business after the Administration for Industry and Commerce issues the license. There is no need to go to the police station. As for the issue of taxation, the government will have regulations in the future, and it is difficult to answer now.

　　开家庭照像馆
    可到市工商局登记
    夏阁女士：你们想开个家庭照像馆，仍需要办手续，但很简单，可请区人民政府写一个介绍信，直接到市政府工商局申请登记，领取营业执照。工商局发给执照后即可正式营业。不必去警察局派出所。至于纳税问题，以后政府当有法令规定，现在尚难答复。
