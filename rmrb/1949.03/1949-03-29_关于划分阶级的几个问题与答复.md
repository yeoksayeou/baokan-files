　　Several Questions and Answers Regarding Class Division
    Question: The central authorities stipulate that "the difference between rich peasants and well-to-do middle peasants lies in the fact that the portion of exploitation income of well-to-do middle peasants in a year does not exceed 25% of their total family income for the year, while for rich peasants it exceeds 25%." How should total income and exploitation income be calculated?
    Answer: Theoretically, the difference between rich peasants and well-to-do middle peasants should be based on whether more than half of their net income comes from exploiting others or from their own labor.
    However, net income in agriculture and the surplus value of hired labor in agriculture are not easy to calculate accurately. The surplus of the positive and negative products of agricultural hired labor, after deducting the wages and meals of the hired labor (the variable capital part) and the costs of seeds, fertilizers, and the depreciation of farm tools and livestock, and the feed for livestock (the constant capital part), is the surplus value exploited by the employer from the hired labor; for self-cultivating farmers, the surplus calculated in this way is their net income. The net income of rich peasants is the surplus from their own agricultural labor plus the surplus value from exploiting hired labor. Under the current conditions of rural China and agricultural management, this calculation method is not easy for ordinary farmers to grasp. Therefore, this calculation method should not be adopted.
    To make it simple and easy to implement, the method of calculating total income is used, that is, it is stipulated that anyone whose exploitation income exceeds 25% of their total income is a rich peasant. The so-called total income here, if only in terms of agriculture and the exploitation of hired labor, is the sum of the positive and negative products of the rich peasant's own labor and the hired labor; the so-called exploitation income here is the positive and negative products of the hired labor minus the wages and meals of the hired labor. Although this calculation method is not scientific, it is relatively simple, and the results are roughly the same as those of scientific calculations. Therefore, this calculation method should be used to distinguish between rich peasants and well-to-do middle peasants.
    For some obviously large rich peasants, whose quantity and quality of land far exceed the average of farmers, and who employ two or three or more hired laborers for many years, they can be identified as rich peasants without going through the calculation of exploitation income.
    Question: What is the difference between new-style rich peasants and old-style rich peasants? Are tenant rich peasants new-style rich peasants? Can they be treated as well-to-do middle peasants?
    Answer: Old-style rich peasants are those who occupy more and better land, livestock, farm tools, and other means of production, participate in major agricultural labor themselves, but often rely on semi-feudal methods of exploiting hired labor or other feudal exploitation income, mainly renting out land, as their main or important source of livelihood. New-style rich peasants are those who rent or occupy more and better land, occupy farm tools and other means of production, participate in major agricultural labor themselves, but often rely on capitalist methods of exploiting hired labor or other capitalist exploitation income as their main or important source of livelihood.
    The land ownership of general rich peasants in old China was feudal in nature. The exploitation and bondage of hired laborers were also feudal in nature, and they often engaged in other landlord-style exploitation activities, such as renting out land and lending money at high interest rates. Many old-style rich peasants did not even hire laborers, but only used renting out land and lending money at high interest rates as their main source of livelihood.
    In the land reform, the treatment of old-style rich peasants should be to requisition their excess land and property that exceeds the average of general middle peasants, and leave them with land and property equal to the average of local general middle peasants.
    In the land reform, the treatment of new-style rich peasants is not uniformly the same as that of well-to-do middle peasants. Only those who were originally middle peasants, poor peasants, hired laborers, or other poor people, who, after the establishment of the democratic regime, obtained land and other legitimate interests due to the policies of rent reduction, interest reduction, land distribution, and other assistance to farmers implemented by the democratic government, and worked diligently in production, thus becoming new-style rich peasants, can be treated as well-to-do middle peasants, that is, their excess land should not be extracted and distributed without their consent; their excess property should be protected. As for capitalist-style rich peasants of the old society, in the land reform, their excess land exceeding the average of general middle peasants (including land that is not owned but rented) should be requisitioned, but their original or cultivated land equal to the average of general middle peasants should be retained; excess property exceeding the average of general middle peasants should be protected; however, if their excess property is not needed by themselves but is needed by the farmers, after obtaining their consent, the local government and the peasants' association may jointly decide on appropriate measures to requisition and purchase it. As for new-style rich peasants and agricultural capitalists who use machinery for cultivation or use other important scientific methods for agricultural improvement, the local government should, in conjunction with the peasants' association, decide on appropriate handling methods for their land and property, and the peasants' association should not independently decide on handling. These are the differences in treatment that should exist in the land reform for three different types of new-style rich peasants.
    The land of tenant rich peasants is all or mostly not owned, but rented. They participate in major agricultural labor themselves, but they exploit hired labor as a major or important part of their livelihood, or engage in other forms of exploitation. This kind of rich peasant mainly occupies or mainly occupies means of production and is exploited by landlords. Therefore, they should be classified as new-style rich peasants. In the land reform, this kind of tenant rich peasant should be treated as capitalist-style rich peasants of the old society, not as well-to-do middle peasants. Only new-style rich peasants who have risen up after the establishment of the democratic regime should be treated as well-to-do middle peasants in the land reform in terms of the disposal of their land and property, but it is only according to the treatment of well-to-do middle peasants, not to say that this kind of new rich peasant is a well-to-do middle peasant.
    Question: When calculating income and exploitation, how should agricultural by-products and income from concurrently operated industrial and commercial activities be calculated? How should the class status of these people be determined?
    Answer: Agricultural by-products should theoretically be included in the total income; however, if the by-products are not large and not important, they can be excluded for the sake of convenient calculation. As for income from handicrafts and other side occupations outside of agriculture, if the percentage of total income is not large, it can be excluded for the sake of convenient calculation. However, if the percentage of their side business income in the total income is relatively large (more than one-third), and their exploitation income in agriculture exceeds 25% of the total agricultural income, then their class status should be determined as rich peasant (or middle peasant) concurrently engaged in handicrafts or merchants, peddlers, etc. If they are rich peasants concurrently engaged in handicrafts (or merchants, peddlers), their land, grain, farm tools, etc., should be treated as rich peasants in the land reform, and their handicraft (or commercial) part should be resolutely protected.
    Question: If a landlord goes bankrupt, still does not engage in labor, and his living conditions are not as good as those of middle peasants, what class status should he be assigned? What class status should be assigned to those who rely on usurious exploitation as the main source of livelihood for the whole family, but whose living conditions are not as good as those of middle peasants? Is living condition one of the criteria for class division?
    Answer: If a landlord goes bankrupt, still does not engage in labor, and his living conditions are not as good as those of middle peasants, and this has continued for more than three years, then he should not be designated as a bankrupt landlord. If he has lost his ability to work, he should be designated as a pauper; if he can work but does not work, or engages in improper occupations, he should be designated as a vagrant.
    Those who rely on usurious exploitation as the main source of livelihood, but whose lives are not as good as those of middle peasants, should not be considered usurers, nor should they be treated as landlords. If they have lost their ability to work, they should be designated as paupers; if they can work but do not work, or engage in improper occupations, they should be designated as vagrants.
    This does not change the principles pointed out by Comrade Ren Bishi. Comrade Ren Bishi said: "There is only one criterion for dividing classes, and that is to determine different classes based on people's different relationships to the means of production. Because of the possession or non-possession of the means of production, the amount of possession, what is possessed, and how it is used, various different exploitative and exploited relationships are produced, which is the only criterion for dividing classes." The bankrupt landlords and those who live by lending small amounts of money for interest mentioned above are people who do not possess, or possess very little, means of production, and naturally cannot constitute landlord or usurer status. This is not adding a "living standard" to the only standard. Moreover, since these people already live worse than middle peasants, they should not be treated as landlords in the land reform, but should be treated as paupers or vagrants.
    Question: Some coal kiln and iron factory owners do not operate themselves, but rent out the factory buildings and tools to others, collect rent, and are responsible for repairing the factory buildings and repairing tools (after the establishment of the democratic regime, the rent is reduced, and the factory owner is only responsible for repairing the factory buildings, but not for repairing tools). Is this leasing relationship feudal exploitation?
    Answer: This should not be regarded as feudal exploitation. It should not be confiscated in the land reform, and the rent should not be excessively reduced. As for the issue of the foundation of the factory building and the mining rights of small coal kilns, private ownership is still allowed, and there should be no infringement. However, the state can collect some taxes.
    Question: Are teachers in schools in the liberated areas self-employed or revolutionary staff? Should their families enjoy the treatment of substitute cultivation?
    Answer: Teachers employed by the people's government in schools established by the people's government in the liberated areas should in principle be considered revolutionary staff during their work period and enjoy the treatment that revolutionary staff should enjoy. However, like other revolutionary staff, their families cannot generally enjoy the treatment of substitute cultivation. Only those who receive supply system treatment and whose family economic conditions are extremely difficult can be given substitute cultivation as appropriate.
    Question: How should the class status of brokers (rural brokers) be assessed, and how should they be treated in the land reform?
    Answer: Rural brokers, if they do not possess capital (or only possess a small amount of capital), but engage in intermediary activities between commodity transactions themselves, obtain a small amount of profit, and even sometimes have to obtain supplementary income through other methods to maintain their livelihoods, should be regarded as small merchants. Conversely, if they possess a relatively large amount of capital, open shops, and engage in the activities of brokers in commerce, obtaining more profit, they should be regarded as commercial capitalists. The issue of brokers should be resolved in the development of cooperative undertakings. This issue cannot be resolved in the land reform, and the abolition of brokers should not be forced.

　　关于划分阶级的几个问题与答复
    问：中央规定：“富农与富裕中农的区别，在于富裕中农一年剥削收入的分量，不超过其全家一年总收入的百分之二十五，富农则超过百分之二十五”。总收入与剥削收入究应如何计算？
    答：从理论上讲，富农与富裕中农的区别，应该是以其纯收入中的二分之一以上，是剥削他人得来，还是自己劳动得来，做为划分的标准。
    但是，农业中的纯收入，和农业中雇工的剩余价值，是不容易精确计算的。农业雇工的正副生产物，扣除雇工的工资、伙食（可变资本部分）和种籽、肥料以及农具耕畜的折耗、耕畜的饲料等成本（不变资本部分）以后的盈余，就是雇工被雇主剥削的剩余价值；对自耕的农民而言，如此计算出来的盈余，就是他的纯收入。富农的纯收入，则是自己从事农业劳动的盈余，加上对雇工剥削的剩余价值。在目前中国农村与农业经营的条件下，这种计算方法，是一般农民所不易掌握的。故不宜采用这种计算方法。
    为求得简便易行，故改用计算总收入的方法，即规定凡剥削收入超过其总收入百分之二十五者，即为富农。这里所谓的总收入，如单就农业及对雇工的剥削而言，就是富农自己劳动的和雇工劳动的正副生产物之总和；这里所谓的剥削收入，就是雇工的正副生产物扣除雇工的工资伙食。这种计算方法，虽然不算科学，但是较为简便，与科学计算的结果也可以大致不差。故应采用这种计算方法，来区别富农与富裕中农。
    对于某些显著的大富农，其土地的数量和质量超过农民的平均数很多，而又长年雇用两个或三个以上的雇工，虽不经过剥削收入的计算，也可以确定为富农。
    问：新式富农与旧式富农的区别何在？佃富农是否新式富农？可否按富裕中农待遇？
    答：旧式富农，是占有较多较好的土地、耕畜、农具及其他生产资料，自己参加主要农业劳动，但是经常依靠以半封建方法剥削雇工或其他封建剥削收入，主要是出租土地，作为其主要或重要生活来源的人们。新式富农是租入或占有较多较好的土地，占有农具及其他生产资料，自己参加主要农业劳动，但经常依靠以资本主义方法剥削雇工或其他资本主义剥削的收入，作为其主要或重要生活来源的人们。
    旧中国的一般富农的土地所有权，是封建性的，对于雇工的剥削和束缚，也带封建性，并且多兼营其他地主方法的剥削事业，例如出租土地、放高利贷等；许多旧式富农，甚至并不雇工，而只以出租土地、放高利贷等作为其主要生活来源。
    在土地改革中对旧式富农的待遇，应征收其超过一般中农平均所有的多余的土地和财产，而留给他以等于当地一般中农平均所有的土地和财产。
    在土地改革中对新式富农的待遇，也不是一律照富裕中农待遇，只有那些原属中农、贫农、雇农或其他贫苦人民，在民主政权成立后，因民主政府所实行的减租、减息、分配土地及其他扶助农民的政策，而得到土地及其他正当利益，勤劳生产，因而成为新式富农者，始得照富裕中农待遇，即对其多余的土地，不得本人同意，亦不应抽出分配；其多余的财产，则应予保护。至于对旧社会的资本主义式富农，在土地改革中，则应征收其超过一般中农平均所有的多余土地（不是自有而是租入的土地也包括在内），但应保留其原有的或原耕的等于一般中农平均所有的土地；超过一般中农平均所有的多余财产则应予保护；但如其多余财产为本人所不需要，而为农民所需要者，在取得本人同意之后，得由当地政府与农会会同决定适当办法，予以征购。至于对用机器耕作或用其他重要科学方法从事农业改良的新式富农及农业资本家，其土地财产，则应由当地政府会同农会决定适当处理办法，不得由农会单独决定处理。这是在土地改革中对三种不同的新式富农，在待遇上应有的差别。
    佃富农的土地，是全部或大部并非自有，而是租入的，自己参加主要农业劳动，但他剥削雇工，作为其主要或重要生活来源之一部，或兼营其他方式的剥削，这种富农主要的既只占有或主要的是占有生产工具，且受地主剥削，故应划为新式富农，在土地改革中，对这种佃富农应按旧社会的资本主义式富农待遇，而不是按富裕中农待遇。只有在民主政权成立后，上升起来的新式富农，在土地改革中对其土地财产的处理，才应按富裕中农待遇，但只是按富裕中农待遇，而不是说这种新富农，就是富裕中农。
    问：在计算收入和剥削时，农业副产物及兼营的工商业收入，如何算法？如何划定这些人的成份？
    答：农业耕作中的副产物，按理是应该计算在总收入之内的；但如副产物不多，且不关重要，为计算方便计，也可以除外不算。至于农业以外的手工业及其他副业收入，如在总收入中所占的百分数不大，为计算方便计，也可以除外不算。但如其副业收入在总收入中所占之百分数较大（超过三分之一），而其在农业方面又有超过农业总收入的百分之二十五的剥削收入，则应将他的成份订为富农（或中农）兼手工业者或商人、小贩之类。如系富农兼手工业者（或商人、小贩），其土地粮食农具等，在土地改革中，应按富农处理，而其手工业（或商业）部分，则应坚决保护不动。
    问：地主破产，仍不从事劳动，而其生活状况不如中农者，应订为什么成份？依高利贷剥削为全家主要生活来源，而其生活状况不如中农者，应订为什么成份？生活状况是否列为划阶级的标准之一？
    答：地主破产了，仍不从事劳动，而其生活状况不如中农，并已连续三年以上者，则不应订为破产地主。如已丧失劳力者，则订为贫民；如能劳动、而不劳动，或从事不正当职业者，应订为游民。
    依靠高利贷剥削为生活的主要来源，而其生活又不如中农者，则不应认为是高利贷者，也不照地主成份处理。如已丧失劳动力者，则订为贫民；如能劳动、而不劳动，或从事不正当职业者，则订为游民。
    这并没有改变任弼时同志指出的原则。任弼时同志说：“划分阶级的标准，只有一个，就是依据人们对于生产资料的关系的不同，来确定各种不同的阶级。由于生产资料占有与否，占有多少，占有什么，如何使用，而产生各种不同的剥削被剥削关系，就是划分阶级的唯一标准”。上面所说的破产地主和放小额债款吃利为生者，则是不占有、或很少占有生产资料的人们，自然不能构成地主或高利贷者成份，这并不是在唯一标准以外，又加上一个什么“生活标准”。而且这些人，既已生活不如中农，在土改中自不应按地主待遇，而应按贫民或游民待遇。
    问：有的煤窑、铁厂的窑主、厂主自己不经营，把厂房、工具出租给别人经营，自己收租钱，并负责修缮厂房，修补工具（民主政权成立后，租金减低，厂主只负责修缮厂房，而不修补工具了）。这种租赁关系，是否封建剥削？
    答：这还不应算做封建剥削，在土改中不应没收，租金也不应过分压低。至于厂房的地基和小煤窑的矿权问题，现在还是允许私有的，也不应有所侵犯。但国家可以收税若干。
    问：解放区的学校教员，是自由职业者，还是革命职员？他们的家属应否享受代耕的待遇？
    答：在解放区人民政府所设的学校中，由人民政府所聘用的教员，在其工作期间，原则上都应认为革命职员，享受革命职员所应享受的待遇。但与其他革命职员一样，其家属不能一般地享受代耕的待遇，只有本人受供给制待遇，而其家庭经济状况极端困难者，才能酌量实行代耕。
    问：如何评定经纪人（乡镇人牙纪）的阶级成份，在土地改革中应如何对待他们？
    答：乡镇中的牙纪，如系不占有资本（或只占有小部资本），而是自己从事商品买卖之间的中间媒介的活动，取得少量利润，甚至有时还要以其他方法取得补助收入才能维持生活者，应以小商贩论。反之，如占有资本较大，开设行栈，从事商业中的经纪人的活动，取得利润较多者，则应视为商业资本家。牙纪问题，应在合作事业之发展中求得解决，在土地改革中不能解决这一问题，更不应强制废除牙纪。
