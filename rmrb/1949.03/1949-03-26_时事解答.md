Current Affairs Q&A

　　I. What kind of organization is the United Nations General Assembly?
　　II. What is a satellite state?
　　Dear Service Team: I have two questions I would like to ask, please answer: (1) What kind of organization is the United Nations General Assembly? Which countries participate? (2) What is a "satellite state"?
　　　　　Reader Jia Ren
　　Answer: The full name of the United Nations General Assembly should be the United Nations General Assembly, abbreviated as UNGA, which is one of the main bodies of the entire United Nations organization (the others are the Security Council, the Economic and Social Council, the Trusteeship Council, the International Court of Justice, and the Secretariat).

　　The United Nations is an international organization established after World War II to maintain world security and peace. The "Atlantic Charter" was the precursor to the creation of the "United Nations," beginning with the joint declaration of war issued by twenty-six Allied nations in 1942. It was formally proposed at the Moscow Conference of Foreign Ministers of the Soviet Union, the United States, and the United Kingdom in October 1943. The establishment of this international organization went through many twists and turns and struggles. In 1944, the Dumbarton Oaks Conference of the Soviet Union, the United States, and the United Kingdom drafted the United Nations Charter, formally establishing the name "United Nations." In February 1945, the Yalta Conference of the Soviet Union, the United States, and the United Kingdom made some revisions and additions to the charter draft. In May 1945, the San Francisco Conference finalized the United Nations Charter, and the United Nations organization was formally established.

　　However, since the Second UN General Assembly (September 16, 1947), the reactionary factions of the United States and Britain have been actively engaged in propaganda and preparations for a new war and have attempted to manipulate the UNGA into a tool for launching a new war. The firm opposition of the peace-loving countries, led by the Soviet Union, prevented the smooth completion of the reactionary US-British plot.

　　The UNGA is divided into seven committees: the Steering Committee, the Political and Security Committee, the Economic and Financial Committee, the Social, Humanitarian, and Cultural Committee, the Trusteeship Committee, the Administrative and Budgetary Committee, and the Legal Committee.

　　As of now, the following fifty-seven countries participate in the United Nations General Assembly: the Soviet Union, the United States, the United Kingdom, France, "China" (the Kuomintang reactionary government), Argentina, Australia, Belgium, Bolivia, Brazil, Canada, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Cuba, Czechoslovakia, Denmark, the Dominican Republic, Ecuador, Egypt, Abyssinia, Greece, Guatemala, Haiti, Honduras, India, Iran, Iraq, Lebanon, Liberia, Luxembourg, Mexico, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Nicaragua, Norway, Panama, Paraguay, Peru, the Philippines, Poland, El Salvador, Saudi Arabia, Syria, Turkey, Ukraine, the Union of South Africa, Uruguay, Venezuela, Byelorussia, Yugoslavia, Sweden, Iceland, Afghanistan, Yemen, Pakistan, and Siam.

　　II. Satellite state: This uses a natural phenomenon to explain the relationship between an imperialist power and its subordinate countries. A satellite is a celestial body that revolves around a planet, such as the moon, which is a satellite of the earth. Therefore, a country that relies on the whims of another country or is controlled by it is like a satellite and is thus called a satellite state. For example, Argentina and many other small countries in South America are "satellite states" of the United States.

            一、联合国大会是怎样一个组织？
            二、何谓卫星国？
    服务组的先生：兹有两个问题叩询，请答复：（一）联合国大会是怎样的一个组织？有哪些国家参加？（二）何谓“卫星国”？　　　　
　　　读者贾仁
    答：联合国大会的全名应是联合国全体大会，简称联大，是整个联合国组织的主要机构之一（其余是安全理事会、经济与社会理事会、托管理事会、国际法院及秘书处）。
    联合国组织是第二次世界大战后，维持世界安全与和平的一个国际机构。“大西洋宪章”是“联合国”创立的先声，开端于一九四二年的二十六个同盟国家发表的联合作战宣言。在一九四三年十月苏、美、英三国外长莫斯科会议上正式创议建立。这个国际机构的建立曾经历了很多波折与斗争，到一九四四年苏、美、英敦巴顿橡树会议拟定了联合国宪章，正式确定“联合国”名称，一九四五年二月苏、美、英三强的雅尔达会议中对宪草加以部分的修正和补充，到一九四五年五月旧金山会议订定联合国宪章，联合国组织就正式成立了。
    但是，由于美英反动派从联大二届会议（一九四七年九月十六日）以来，积极进行新战争的宣传和准备，并企图操纵联大变成一发动新战争的卸用机构，其间曾经以苏联为首的和平国家的坚决反对，使美英反动阴谋未能顺利达成。
    联大分七个委员会：指导委员会、政治安全委员会、经济财政委员会、社会慈善及文化委员会、托管委员会、行政及预算委员会、法律委员会。
    参加联合国大会的，到现在共有五十七国是：苏联、美国、英国、法国、“中国”（国民党反动政府）、阿根廷、澳大利亚、比利时、玻利维亚、巴西、加拿大、智利、哥伦比亚、哥斯达黎加、古巴、捷克斯洛伐克、丹麦、多米尼加、厄瓜多尔、埃及、阿比利西亚、希腊、危地马拉、海地、洪都拉斯、印度、伊朗、伊拉克、黎巴嫩、利比里亚、卢森堡、墨西哥、荷兰、纽西兰、尼加拉瓜、挪威、巴那马、巴拉圭、秘鲁、菲律宾、波兰、萨尔瓦多、沙特阿拉伯、叙利亚、土耳其、乌克兰、南非联邦、乌拉圭、委内瑞拉、白俄罗斯、南斯拉夫、瑞典、冰岛、阿富汗、也门、巴基斯坦及暹罗。
    二、卫星国：是以自然界的现象，说明某一帝国主义与其附从国的关系。卫星，是环绕行星运转的星球，如月亮就是地球的卫星。因此，仰承某一国家的鼻息，或被其支配，就如同卫星，因而叫她做卫星国。如阿根廷等南美许多小国就是美国的“卫星国”。
