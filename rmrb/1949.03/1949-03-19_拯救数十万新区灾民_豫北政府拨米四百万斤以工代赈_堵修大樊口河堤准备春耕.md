(Taihang Electricity) More than 4,000 people in the new districts of Wu'an, Xiuwu, and Huojia counties in the Fourth Special District, under the leadership of the Fourth Special District People's Government, began work on March 1st to block and repair the Da Fankou River Embankment of the Qin River southwest of Xiuwu and Wu'an cities. Da Fankou was originally the lower reaches of the Qin River, where the Qin River flows into the Yellow River. In the summer of the 36th year of the Republic of China [1947], the Kuomintang bandit army, in order to prevent our army from advancing into the area south of the Daoqing Railway, disregarding the lives and property of hundreds of thousands of people, dug up the embankment and released water, causing an unprecedented flood in northern Henan. The river water overflowed, passing through Wu'an and Xiuwu to the Dan River, and then directly into the Wei River via Huojia, Xinxiang, and Huixian, flooding countless fertile fields and houses. In the three counties of Wu (zhi), Xiu (wu), and Huo (jia) alone, the number of disaster victims reached 300,000. For two years, there has been no harvest, and many villages are still surrounded by vast expanses of water, making it difficult for vehicles and horses to travel, and people are displaced. After the liberation of the vast area of the Daoqing Line last winter, the People's Government, in order to save hundreds of thousands of disaster victims and enable them to resume production and rebuild their homes, has planned to block and repair the river embankment several times. After submitting a request to the North China People's Government, 4 million jin of millet were allocated for river management, and materials such as stone and wood for embankment construction were purchased. The method of providing work relief was adopted to organize the masses to block and repair the embankment. Under the slogan of "river management combined with disaster relief," thousands upon thousands of farmers have voluntarily contracted for work and rushed to transport and buy materials. It is estimated that it will be completed by the end of March. After the river water returns to its original course, most of the fertile land will still be able to catch up with planting this spring. The local disaster victims expressed their deep gratitude to the democratic government for this measure.

　　拯救数十万新区灾民
  　豫北政府拨米四百万斤以工代赈
    堵修大樊口河堤准备春耕
    【太行电】此间四专区武陟、修武、获嘉三县新区四千余群众，在我四专区人民政府领导下，于三月一日开始兴工堵修修武、武陟城西南沁河之大樊口河堤。大樊口原为沁河最下游，沁河即从该地流入黄河。民国三十六年夏。国民党匪军为阻止我军挺进道清路南地区，不顾数十万人民之生命财产，掘堤放水，造成豫北前所未有的大水患。河水漫流，经武陟、修武至丹河后，沿获嘉、新乡、辉县直入卫河，淹没良田房屋难以数计。仅武（陟）、修（武）、获（嘉）三县被灾群众即达三十万，两年来没有收成，不少村庄四周至今仍是一片汪洋，车马难行，群众流离失所。去冬道清线广大地区解放后，人民政府为拯救数十万灾民，使他们恢复生产、重建家园，曾数次筹划堵修该河堤。经呈请华北人民政府批准，拨治河费小米四百万斤，购置筑堤石、木料等器材，采取以工代赈办法组织群众堵修。在治河结合救灾的口号下，成千成万农民纷纷自动包工，抢先运、买器材。预计三月底即可竣工。河水归故后，大部良田还能赶上今春下种。当地灾民对民主政府此一措施深表感谢。
