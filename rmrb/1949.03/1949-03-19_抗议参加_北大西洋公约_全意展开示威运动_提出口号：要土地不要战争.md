TASS reports: The Italian General Confederation of Labor announced on the 13th that strikes and demonstrations protesting against participation in the military North Atlantic Treaty are taking place throughout Italy. In major towns in the regions of Tuscany, Liguria, Emilia, Maria, Campania, Lazio, and Piedmont, protest demonstrations were held on March 12th. Participants included workers from various sectors, including chemical workers, construction workers, pottery and cement industry workers, metalworkers, miners, agricultural workers, food workers, dockworkers, municipal employees, as well as women and the unemployed. The movement has expanded to all major enterprises in the Milan industrial zone. The Milan Trade Union Committee convened a meeting of representatives from various democratic groups in Milan, at which it was decided to establish a permanent committee for peace. Mass rallies were held in major enterprises in Naples. The Southern Italy Front has arranged to hold mass protest demonstrations on March 13th and 14th. General strikes were held in Pescara and Genoa. The National Association of Partisans, the Cooperative League, the Italian Women's League, the Youth League, and other mass organizations have issued statements to their members, calling on them to participate in protest demonstrations.

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 17th. According to a Rome dispatch from Telepress on the 15th: As the Italian Parliament's debate on the North Atlantic Treaty entered its third day, anti-war demonstrations continued across the country. Workers at the Fiat automobile factory in Turin went on strike for fifteen minutes yesterday. At 5 p.m., a city-wide strike was held, and 50,000 people held a mass rally in the central square, where Communist parliamentarian Nagaville addressed the demonstrators. The Milan City Trade Union Committee organized an anti-war action committee. The committee requested the government to hold a national referendum to decide whether to participate in the North Atlantic Treaty. Various factories in the city held brief strikes on the 14th. 30,000 workers in Naples gathered in Garibaldi Square to oppose the North Atlantic Treaty. A city-wide general strike was held in Livorno. Tram services in Genoa were suspended for a short period. In addition, protest strikes were held in Savona, Florence, Brescia, Pavia (south of Milan), Cremona (southeast of Milan), and other places. Representatives of more than two million agricultural workers and farmers met in Modena (northwest of Bologna) on the 14th and unanimously passed a resolution opposing the North Atlantic Treaty, putting forward the slogan: "We want land, not war!" TASS also reports from Rome: During the debate in the Lower House on the 15th, Italian Communist parliamentarian Pajetta pointed out that the North Atlantic Treaty proves the aggressive nature of American policy and the anti-Soviet war preparations of the American ruling clique. He told the Italian ruling clique: "If you sign the military treaty, you cannot restrain Italy. Italy will respond with a solemn voice and a brave struggle, and will achieve the victory of a peaceful policy."
