Xinhua News Agency, Beiping, March 28th: News from Nanjing states that the reactionary Kuomintang government is mobilizing troops south of the Yangtze River and continuing its frenzied conscription of soldiers and grain. A Nanjing dispatch from the American imperialist Associated Press on the 19th admits: "The current political atmosphere in Kuomintang China points more towards war than towards peace." Because the Kuomintang Jinghu-Hangzhou Garrison Headquarters has ordered a strict ban on ships sailing to the north bank of the Yangtze River, threatening to sink them immediately, commercial shipping on the Yangtze River has completely stopped in the latter half of this month. At the same time, the fascist measures of the reactionary Kuomintang government in politics have also been strengthened, with the reactionary government continuing to arrest students in Nanjing. The puppet Jinghu-Hangzhou Headquarters also issued an order on the 25th banning the sale of 185 kinds of newspapers and magazines from Hong Kong and other places within its jurisdiction.

　　国民党继续狂热征兵
    正在长江以南调动军队
    其战争气氛多于和平气氛
    【新华社北平二十八日电】来自南京的消息称：国民党反动政府正在长江以南调动军队，并继续狂热的进行征兵、征粮。美国帝国主义的合众社十九日南京电承认：目前国民党中国的政治气氛指向战争多于指向和平。由于国民党京沪杭警备总司令部下令严禁航船开往长江北岸，否则将立予击沉，本月下旬长江商业航运业已完全停止。与此同时国民党反动政府在政治上的法西斯措施也加强了，反动政府在南京继续逮捕学生。伪京沪杭总司令部并在二十五日下令禁止香港等地报纸杂志一百八十五种在它的管辖区内销售。
