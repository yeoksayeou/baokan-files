　　Italian Socialist Party
　　Currently the second largest party in Italy, with over 900,000 members as of 1948 statistics. Fascist leader Mussolini was once an important member of the party, but was expelled in 1914. After the collapse of Mussolini's fascist regime, the party began to correct its past right-leaning policies, formed a united front with the Italian Communist Party, and expelled the party's right-wing leader Saragat. In the 1948 Italian general election, the cooperation between the Communist and Socialist parties further strengthened the strength of the struggle against the reactionary government. The current Secretary-General of the party is Basso; the Deputy Secretary-General is Lussu; and the left-wing leader Nenni was elected as a member of the party's executive committee in January 1948, and is also the guide of the party's newspaper, Avanti!, and the chairman of the party's parliamentary group.

　　Gasperi
　　The leader of the Italian Christian Democratic Party (a party of reactionary landlords and capitalists). He served as the Prime Minister of the coalition cabinet from 1946, implementing anti-democratic measures. After the American imperialism granted him a US$100 million loan, he openly rejected the Communist Party and the Socialist Party. In May 1947, he formed his own one-party dictatorship government, selling national sovereignty to the United States and oppressing the broad masses of the people. Therefore, he became an enemy of the interests of the Italian people.

　　World Federation of Trade Unions
　　The Soviet-British Trade Union Committee was established in November 1941. The fourth session of the Soviet-British Trade Union Committee in October 1944 made the decision to convene the World Trade Union Congress. On February 6, 1945, more than 200 representatives of trade union organizations from 38 Allied countries and 7 neutral countries, representing 60 million organized workers, met in London. According to the resolutions of this meeting, the World Federation of Trade Unions was officially established in Paris in September of the same year. At that time, trade unions from 44 countries participated. The World Federation of Trade Unions currently has 80 million members.
