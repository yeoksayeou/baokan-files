　　Learning Dynamics
    Zhangjiakou Factories and机关 Broadly Carry Out Learning
    In order to improve the political consciousness, cultural level, and theoretical level of all employees, the Ping-Sui Railway Bureau, Zhangjiakou No. 1 Flour Mill, Zhangjiakou Mechanized Flour Mill, Water Company, Xiay花园 Baoxing Coal Mine, and other units have successively established learning committees to conduct learning. Learning groups were divided according to the level of education. The Ping-Sui Railway Bureau also established reading groups, communications groups, blackboard newspapers, and wall newspaper groups. All units stipulate two hours of learning per day. Learning methods: those with reading ability mainly rely on self-study, raising questions for discussion or asking someone to report. Those with a low level of education mainly rely on explanation and discussion. Literacy learning adopts a method that combines with work. For example, Zhangjiakou Mechanized Flour Mill starts learning from frequently used words such as sacks and wheat. The workers' group of Zhangjiakou Ping-Sui Railway Hospital, in addition to participating in current affairs discussions, also has someone specifically teaching literacy. In addition, they also take time to sing and perform, and the entire hospital presents a lively and happy new atmosphere. Railway workers have also begun to actively write articles for the Party newspaper.
    Qicun Coal Mine All Employees Study Current Events to Improve Production
    △ All employees of the Qicun Coal Mine of Taihang Industrial Company, during the first month of the lunar calendar, successively studied "Carry the Revolution Through to the End" and Chairman Mao's statement on the current situation. During the discussion, everyone unanimously believed that only by realizing Chairman Mao's eight peace conditions can there be true peace, and put forward the slogan of striving to improve the production plan to fight for the realization of carrying the revolution through to the end.
    Yexian Holds Learning Tests to Improve Cadre and Militia Understanding
    In order to understand and expose the Kuomintang reactionaries' peace tricks, the Propaganda Department of the Yexian County Party Committee specially sent people to various districts on January 30th to conduct a learning discussion and test, and the results were very rewarding: 1. It made the cadres and militiamen ideologically clear that Chiang Kai-shek's seeking peace was false, and in connection with the actual local situation, they distinguished the class boundaries and realized that only struggle can achieve true peace. For example, Comrade Zhang Huasheng, a cadre in the sixth district, said: "Chiang Kai-shek's stepping down and Li Zongren's taking over is just changing the soup but not the medicine. The common point is that they are against the people." Comrade Zheng Rui said: "Anyway, these guys can't change their anti-people nature. As long as they exist for one day, there will be no peace." 2. It recognized that the eight peace conditions proposed by Chairman Mao truly represent the will of the people, are correct, and are indispensable. Many comrades said: "In the past, I didn't understand those eight articles deeply enough. After discussion, I realized that not a single one is dispensable." Judging from this learning test, it proves that the simple test in the past could not solve the internal problems of thought. Only through repeated discussions can the actual problems be put forward, the wrong understanding can be criticized, and the correct theory can be deeply understood.

　　学习动态
    张垣工厂机关　普遍开展学习
    为了提高全体职工的政治觉悟、文化水平和理论水平，平绥铁路局、张家口第一面粉厂、张家口机制面粉厂、自来水公司、下花园宝兴煤矿等单位先后成立了学委会进行学习。按文化程度划分了学习小组。平绥铁路局并建立了读报组、通讯组、黑板报及墙报组。各单位均规定每天学习两小时。学习方法：有阅读能力者以自读为主，提出疑难讨论或请人报告。文化程度低的主要靠讲解和讨论。识字学习，采取与工作结合的方法。如张垣机制面粉厂从经常用的麻袋，小麦等字学起。张家口平绥铁路医院工人组除参加时事讨论外，并有专人教识字。此外还抽空唱歌、演剧，全院呈现了活泼愉快的新气象。铁路职工们并开始积极为党报写稿。
    祁村煤矿全体职工学习时事提高生产
    △太行实业公司祁村煤矿全体职工，在阴历正月曾经先后学习“将革命进行到底”及毛主席对时局的声明。在讨论的过程中，大家一致认为只有实现了毛主席的八项和平条件才是真正的和平，并提出努力提高生产计划的口号，为实现将革命进行到底而奋斗。
    邺县举行学习测验　干部民兵认识提高
    为了认识与揭发国民党反动派的和平鬼把戏，邺县县委宣传部特于元月三十日派人到各区进行了一次学习讨论与测验，结果收获很大：一、使干部民兵在思想上明确了蒋介石求和是假的，并联系当地实际情况，分清了阶级界限，认识只有斗争才能实现真正的和平。如六区干部张华生同志说：“蒋介石下台，换上李宗仁，是换汤不换药，一个共同点都是反人民。”郑瑞同志说：“反正这些家伙改不了反人民的本性，一天有他存在，一天就没有和平。”二、认识了毛主席提的八项和平条件是真正代表民意的，是正确的，缺一不可的，有不少同志说：“过去看了那八条，很不够深刻，经过讨论后，认识到缺了一条也不行。”从这次学习测验来看，证明过去的单纯测验，解决不了思想的内在问题，只有经过反复讨论，才能把实际问题摆出来，对错误的认识给以批判，对正确的理论才能体会的深刻。
