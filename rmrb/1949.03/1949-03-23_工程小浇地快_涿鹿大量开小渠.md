Small Projects, Fast Irrigation
	Zhuolu Massively Opens Small Canals

[Chahar News] The Zhuolu County government is widely organizing the masses to dig small canals in order to complete them in time and irrigate the land promptly. In the past month, thanks to the specific leadership of county and district cadres in solving problems for the masses, seven canals, including the South Second Canal, are either actively preparing or have already started construction. It is planned that all will be completed this spring, irrigating a total of 7,200 mu of land. In addition, villages from Xia Hulu to Yizhuang can utilize the Sanggan River water to build a large canal fifty li long, capable of irrigating 50,000 to 60,000 mu of land. To open this large canal, County Head Yang and the Head of the Industrial Department invited local farmers with experience in water conservancy and jointly surveyed the area several times. Because the project is too large and difficult to measure accurately at the moment, construction cannot begin immediately. The Chahar Provincial Water Conservancy Engineering Team heading to Wei County is preparing to conduct accurate surveys soon. The canal opening work in Zhuolu in the past month has yielded the following experiences: (1) Developing water conservancy and increasing grain production is the urgent demand of the masses, but only when cadres go deep, provide specific organizational leadership, and solve problems in a timely manner can it be done well. (2) Fully utilize experienced old farmers to help plan and open a large number of small canals. In this way, water conservancy construction can be universally developed. Otherwise, waiting exclusively for the construction of large canals will waste time and delay work, and neither large canals nor small ones will be completed. (3) Reasonably resolving the issue of canal land occupation is an important problem. The principle of small interests being subordinate to large interests should be followed to reasonably resolve the adjustment, rental, and other issues related to the land occupied by the canals, in order to expand the development of water conservancy. (4) Resolutely overcome the monopoly of water conservancy, and resolve the contradictions between upstream and downstream areas, jointly establish leading institutions, unify steps, and formulate a fair and reasonable water usage system. (5) Leaders must pay special attention to carefully estimating the amount of water when opening canals, in order to avoid blind construction that wastes time and delays work. In addition, it should also be noted that when certain canals have insufficient water in certain seasons, the new canals must be subordinate to the old canals, and general crops must be subordinate to seedling planting; clear water irrigation must be subordinate to flood siltation.

　　工程小浇地快
    涿鹿大量开小渠
    【察哈尔讯】涿鹿县政府正广泛组织群众，开掘小的水渠，以便及时完成，及时浇地。一月来，由于县区干部具体领导群众解决问题，南二渠等七道渠，有的积极准备，有的已经动工，计划今春全部完成，共可浇地七千二百亩。另外，自下葫芦到易庄一带的村庄，可利用桑乾河水，兴修一条长五十里的大渠，能浇地五、六万亩。为开这道大渠，该县杨县长、实业科长，邀请了当地办水利有经验的农民，曾共同勘察数次，因工程太大，一时测量不好，还不能马上动工。赴蔚县的察省水利工程队准备很快前来进行精确的勘察。涿鹿一个月来的开渠工作，获得以下几点经验：（一）兴办水利，增产粮食，是群众的迫切要求，但只有干部深入下去，具体组织领导，及时解决问题，才能很好的搞起来。（二）充分使用有经验的老农帮助策划，大量开小渠。这样，水利建设才能普遍开展。不然，专等着修大的，费时误工，大渠开不成，小的也误了。（三）合理地解决渠道占地是个重要问题。应按小利益服从大利益的原则，合理解决渠道所占土地的调剂、租用等问题，以便水利的发展扩大。（四）坚决克服霸占水利，并解决上游与下游的矛盾，共同建立领导机构，统一步调，订出公平合理的使水制度。（五）领导上须特别注意，开渠要很好估计水量大小，以免费时误工的盲目开办。另外，还要注意，某些水渠在一定季节水量不足时，那就要新渠服从旧渠，一般作物服从安苗播种；清水浇地服从洪水放淤。
