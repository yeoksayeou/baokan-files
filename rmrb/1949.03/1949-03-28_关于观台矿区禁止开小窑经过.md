　　Regarding the Prohibition of Small Coal Mines in the Guantai Mining Area

Editor:
    When we saw the criticism and suggestion published in the People's Daily on February 24th: the issue of not allowing the private opening of small, secret mines in state-owned mining areas, and mentioning that the mine and our county had sent letters three times, and even personally discussed the matter, but not only failed to stop it but also did not reply to the letters. Indeed, our connection with the mine was insufficient, and this is worthy of our self-examination. However, we did not adopt a completely indifferent attitude to this matter. A brief account of the process is as follows:

    A large portion of the masses in the Guantai Second District of our county (mainly Aikou Gangzi Kiln) have historically been semi-agricultural and semi-industrial, unable to maintain their livelihoods solely by relying on land. Therefore, last spring, Guantai workers reflected that they had nothing to do, and the masses reflected that they had no coal to burn. Immediately, Zhao, the head of our county, in consultation with Yang Guibao, the manager of the Liuhegou Coal Mine, signed a contract allowing the cooperative in that area to mine one small kiln, and limiting it to stop by the end of March this year (which has not yet expired). This caused cadres and the masses of Aikou Gangzi Kiln to request to mine small kilns several times. However, because it was within the mining area, which would damage the interests of the national mining area, they were repeatedly mobilized and explained to engage in other production. At that time, the masses and cadres went to the district office to request the district cadres to come to the county to request small kilns. We then requested instructions from the commissioner's office (without formal instructions) and ordered them to immediately stop the mining that had already begun. However, due to our lack of inspection, we discovered that many people in Guantai were privately opening small kilns in the mining area. We immediately ordered them to stop and explained to the masses in many ways, so that most of the private kilns were stopped. Later, we learned that some people were secretly opening them at night. The village cadres were given strict criticism, and the mining of small kilns was stopped.

    In addition, regarding the issue of the production department of the 52nd Regiment continuing to mine small kilns on the south side of the mining area, we did not ignore it, but could not stop it. We gave them opinions several times, but they were not adopted. We had no choice but to report to the higher authorities. The commissioner's office did not give clear instructions on how to deal with it.

    The above is only a brief account of the situation.

　　　　　　　　Anyang County Government

Anyang County Government:
    It is good that you have paid attention to this issue, but according to your review, the lack of timely handling and the failure to specifically organize the masses into other production aspects are probably also one of the reasons why the problem has been delayed. As for the issue of a certain department opening small kilns, you should also actively find ways to resolve it so as not to affect the emotions of the masses.

### 关于观台矿区禁止开小窑经过

专栏：检讨与答复

　　关于观台矿区禁止开小窑经过编辑同志：
    当我们看到二月二十四号人民报上登载的批评与建议：不得在国营矿区私开小密问题，并提及矿上与我县三次来信，并亲自交谈，不但未制止且连信也未答复。的确我们和矿上连系不够，这一点值得我们作检查的。不过我们对此事还不是漠不关心的态度，经过情形简复如下：
    我县观台二区（主要是艾口岗子窑）群众有大部历来是半农半工的，单纯依靠土地维持不了生活。于是去春观台工人反映没事干，群众反映没煤烧，当即由我县赵县长，会同六河沟煤矿经理杨贵保协商订立合同准许该地区联社开采一个小窑，并限今年三月底停止（现还不到期）。这样曾引起了艾口岗子窑干部、群众数次要求开采小窑，但因在矿区以内，有损于国家矿区利益，乃再三动员解释，让进行别的生产。当时群众干部又到区公所请求区干部来县要求开小窑，我们则一面向专署请示（未正式批示），一面令其已开采的立即停止，但由于我们缺乏检查，发现观台不少群众在矿区私开小窑，立即令其停止，并多方与群众解释，这样私开小窑就大部停止了。后又了解有个别群众夜间偷开的现象，给该村干部以严格的批评，小窑开采也就此停止。
    另有五十二团生产部在矿区南边继续开采小窑问题，我们不是置之不理，而是制止不了，曾数次给其提出意见，均不加采纳，不得已又报告上级，到底如何处理，专署亦没有明文指示。
    以上仅是事情经过的简单情形。
    　　　　　　　　安阳县政府安阳县政府：
    你们曾注意到这问题是好的，但据你们的检讨看来，处理不及时，和没有具体地把群众组织到另一生产方面，怕也是使问题拖延未决的原因之一。至于某部开小窑问题，亦自应积极设法解决，以免影响群众情绪。
