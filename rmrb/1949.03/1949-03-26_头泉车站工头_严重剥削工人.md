　　Head Spring Station Foreman
  　Seriously Exploits Workers
  Editor:
    Zhao Xizhu and other stone crushing workers from Dongfangling, Eighth District, Jingxing, told us: The foreman contracted road construction from the Shijiazhuang Railway Bureau, receiving fifteen catties of millet per cubic meter, but only giving the workers eight catties per cubic meter. Although they also cover some expenses for hammers, pliers, and explosives, they still profit greatly. There are also problems with the method of measurement (that is, calculating the cubic meters of crushed stones). Because the measurement is done on the ground, it inherently compresses the volume of the stones (it is said to be fairer when measured on the train), and the workers suffer losses. For example, a few days ago when measurements were taken, the workers in Nanfangling, with two hundred workdays put in, only had eighty-odd cubic meters measured. Each worker didn't even average half a cubic meter per day, earning only a little more than three catties of millet, leading to very low morale among the workers, who felt they were working for nothing!
    It is said that Xu Taishan, a large foreman from Shang'an Village, once contracted ten thousand cubic meters of crushed stones from the Railway Bureau, earning two catties of millet per cubic meter, and then subcontracted it to secondary foremen, earning a total of twenty thousand catties of millet. He himself only made one trip, saying a few words. Other foremen are also earning thousands of catties of millet, becoming wealthy. They spend lavishly on personal consumption and waste, causing great dissatisfaction among the workers who witness this.
    The above issues affect the lives of many workers (there are currently about one thousand six or seven hundred stone crushing workers at Head Spring Station). The state provides a lot of grain, but it doesn't reach the hands of the laboring workers, but is mostly exploited by the foremen, leading to a decrease in the workers' production enthusiasm. This is also very detrimental to the national construction cause. We hope that relevant departments will immediately conduct an inspection and seriously correct this unreasonable measure to achieve the goal of increasing worker welfare.

### 头泉车站工头　严重剥削工人

　　头泉车站工头
  　严重剥削工人编辑同志：
    井陉八区东方岭砸石子工人赵喜柱等对我们谈：工头从石家庄铁路局包工筑路，每方小米十五斤，放给工人每方八斤，他们虽然还出些锤、钳、炮药的开支，但仍旧获利很大。在收方上（即排收石子以方作计算单位的）也有毛病，因为在地面上收，无形中压缩了石子的体积（据谈在车上收公道），工人吃了亏。如前几天收方时，南方岭一伙工人，用工二百个，只排收了八十余方，每一个工人一天连半方也合不住，只能赚三斤多米，以致工人情绪很低落，认为是白干哩！
    据说上安村大工头许泰山一次从铁路局包出石子一万方，每方赚米二斤，又转包给二头子，共赚米两万斤，他自己只跑了一趟道，说了说话。其它工头，也都是数千斤米赚到家里，大发其财。个人吃喝浪费，任意挥霍，工人见此现象，非常不满。
    以上问题，关系很多工人生活（头泉车站，现有砸石子工人约一千六、七百名），国家拿出好多粮食，没有到了出劳力的工人手里，而大部被工头从中剥夺，以致工人生产情绪降低，这对国家建设事业也是非常不利的。希望有关方面，即刻进行检查，认真纠正这一不合理的措施，以达增进工人福利的目的。
