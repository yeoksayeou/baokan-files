　　Wanping Helps Families of Martyrs, Soldiers, and Workers Prepare for Spring Plowing

　　[Wanping News] Wanping farmers are helping families of martyrs, soldiers, and workers complete their spring plowing preparations. According to statistics, among the 1,162 households of martyrs, soldiers, and workers, which account for one-third of the total households in the first district, 451 households lack or have no labor. Farmers have helped gather 1.58 million jin of firewood, enough for seven months of burning. Among the 699 households of soldiers and workers in the fourth district, 386 households lack or have no labor, but with the help of farmers, fertilizer has been completely delivered to the fields. Party members have taken a leading role in the firewood support campaign for military families. Wang Yurong, the secretary of the Wulipo Village branch in the second district, collects 400 jin of firewood for military families every day. Under his leadership, more than 21,000 jin of firewood have been collected for families of military personnel, workers, and martyrs in five days. (Meng Chen)
　　[Another News] Wanping has basically completed spring plowing preparations such as repairing farm tools, delivering manure, and gathering firewood. According to statistics from the third district, 165 and a half sets of livestock have been prepared. Considering the total land area of the district is 21,050 mu, each set of livestock can plow an average of 127 mu, which can be completely plowed in more than 30 days. To solve the difficulty of livestock shortage, some districts have added hoes. The iron furnace in Housangyu, the second district, has been supported by the promotion agency with 2,000 jin of loan grain, and has produced a large number of goods, including 280 plows, 160 hill plows, and 20 hoes, which the masses are rushing to buy. In the fifth, sixth, and eighth districts, some areas have been harassed by Kuomintang bandit troops for a long time, and the amount of wasteland is very large. The local government is organizing farmers to eliminate the wasteland. In the South Sub-district of the fifth district, out of 1,306 mu of wasteland, 550 mu have been cut off the yellow thatch and smoked into fertilizer in preparation for sowing. According to statistics from the first district, out of 2,121 firewood-burning households, 7,424,000 jin of firewood have been collected. Among the 1,000 coal-burning households, 2,400,000 jin of coal have been prepared, which is enough for seven months of burning. After delivering manure, the farmers in the fourth district actively smoked and accumulated fertilizer. The whole district has smoked 7,200 baskets of fertilizer and dug 58 toilets.
