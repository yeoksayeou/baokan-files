Having Fought Across the Yangtze River to Capture War Criminals
Accusations from a Unit of the People's Liberation Army in the Tianjin-Beijing Area

　　In a rectification campaign, a unit of the People's Liberation Army in the Tianjin-Beijing area has been vehemently denouncing the heinous crimes of the war criminals, igniting boundless hatred.

　　“If you forget the blood shed by our comrades on the battlefield, then go ahead and pity those murderous executioners!” This was said by Zang Mingliang, the deputy platoon leader of the engineering battalion of this unit. He was wounded in July 1946 when the Kuomintang mobilized the 71st Army to attack Xinzhan and Lafa in western Jilin after announcing a ceasefire in the Northeast. Seeing his scars, he immediately remembered his comrades who had joined the army together three years ago and had now gloriously sacrificed or been maimed. He raised his fist and stamped his feet, shouting, “A life for a life! Debts of blood must be repaid in blood!”

　　In a discussion, Chen Yunxiang, who had worked as a worker in Shanghai, recounted the massacres of workers by Kuomintang military police and secret agents when they went on strike to seek survival. He personally witnessed two fellow workers who were arrested being split into two pieces by secret agents who tied their legs to two bamboo poles. After telling this tragic story, he said passionately, “I want to avenge myself and the martyrs who have already died!” Immediately afterwards, Li Ganjiang, whose home was in Guangling County, Jiangxi, also began to cry, “I lost both my parents when I was young, leaving only my elder brother, sister-in-law and me. In the 26th year of the Republic of China (1937), when the Kuomintang was conscripting soldiers in large numbers in Jiangxi, one of the local bailiffs arrested my brother. Later, my brother could not bear the beatings and scoldings from the officials and ran away secretly. The bandits then arrested me to replace my brother. One day, my brother was seen by the company commander and was caught again, severely beaten, and then shot. In a fit of anger, I ran away home, only to find out that my sister-in-law had been forced to remarry.”

　　In a series of accusations, many soldiers, both those from the past and those recently liberated from the battlefield, also used their own firsthand experiences to expose the crimes of the Kuomintang bandit army. Wang Songhai, who had worked in the military law office of the Kuomintang's 49th Army, recounted the Kuomintang bandit army's cold-blooded killings: “In the Nantong and Rugao areas, I personally saw dozens of ordinary people being shot every day under the false accusations of being 'farmers' associations' or 'covert Eighth Route Army members.' Among them was an old woman accused of being the 'Eighth Route Army Women's Association chairperson.' When her son came to claim her body, the son was also shot!” Many People's Liberation Army soldiers, with tears in their eyes, came to the conclusion: If war criminals are not severely punished, and if Chairman Mao's eight peace terms are not thoroughly implemented, the sea of blood and grievances cannot be avenged, and the working people will never be able to stand up.

　　The blood of millions, the tears of millions, the deep hatred of millions – the People's Liberation Army soldiers can never forget. As the comrades of the Second Company said, "Even if they run to Taiwan, even if they run to the ends of the earth, we must arrest them and bring them to justice." All the commanders and fighters of this unit are now waiting for Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu's order to fight all the way across the Yangtze River, capture those war criminals who manufactured the war, and who are still conscripting soldiers, massacring the people, expanding their armies, and attempting to resist the People's Liberation Army.

　　打过江南捉战犯
  　平津解放军某部的控诉
    平津地区人民解放军某部，在整训中，纷纷控诉战犯们的滔天罪行，燃起无限仇恨。
    “假如你忘记了在战场上同志们流的血，那么，你就去怜惜那些杀人的刽子手吧！”这句话是该部工兵营副排长藏明亮说的。他是在一九四六年七月宣布东北停战之后，国民党又调动七十一军向吉林西的新站、拉法进攻时负伤的。他看见了自己的伤痕，就立即想起三年前曾一道参军而现在已经光荣牺牲或残废了的战友们，举拳跺脚的高喊：“杀人要偿命，血债要用血来还。”
    在一个讨论会上，曾在上海当过工人的陈云祥，诉说了工友们为求生存而罢工时，所遭受到国民党军警、特务的屠杀，他亲眼看见两个一起被抓去的工友，被特务们将两腿绑在两根竹子上劈成两块。他在讲述了这个悲惨的故事后，激昂地说：“我要为我，和已经死难的烈士报仇啊！”紧接着一个家在江西广领县的李干江也哭诉起来：“我自幼父母双亡，剩下我和哥嫂三人，民国二十六年国民党在江西大批抓兵时，我们保里头一个就把我哥哥抓去，后来，哥哥因为忍受不了当官的打骂，偷着跑了，匪徒们就把我抓去顶替了哥哥。有一天，哥哥被连长看见，又被捉回去毒打了一顿，便枪毙了。我一气逃跑回家，才知道嫂嫂也已被逼改嫁了。”
    在一连串的控诉当中，许多过去或最近从战场上解放过来的战士们，也用自己耳闻目睹的事实，揭露了国民党匪军的罪行。曾在国民党四十九军军法处干过事的王松海，诉说蒋匪军杀人不眨眼的情形道：“在南通、如皋一带，我每天亲眼看到有几十个老百姓，在被诬为‘农会’、‘暗八路’等罪名下被枪杀。其中有一个被加罪为‘八路妇女会长’的老大娘，当她的儿子来领死尸时，儿子又被枪杀了！”许许多多人民战士，挥着泪得出结论：假如不严惩战犯，假如不彻底执行毛主席的八个和平条件，血海冤仇就无法报，劳动人民就永远翻不了身。
    千万人的鲜血，千万人的眼泪，千万人的深仇，人民战士是永远不能忘记的。正如二连同志所说的：“别说跑到台湾，跑到任何天涯海角，也非把他抓来归案法办不可。”该部全体指战员现在正等着毛主席朱总司令的一声令下，一直打过江南去，捉拿那些制造战争、和现在还在大肆抓兵、屠杀人民、扩充军备、企图顽抗人民解放军的战争罪犯。
