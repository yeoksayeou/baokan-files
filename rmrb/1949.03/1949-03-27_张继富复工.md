Zhang Jifu Resumes Work
　　On the afternoon of the 14th of this month, Zhang Jifu, an old worker at the Houji Grain Store outside Qianmen in Beiping, came to the social service group of this newspaper to complain that he had been unjustly dismissed by the store manager, Bao Xintang, and was currently destitute.
　　Zhang Jifu used to be a coal miner in the Northeast. He came to Beiping last year and was introduced by a friend to the Houji Grain Store outside Qianmen to look after the electric mill. This year, because a grain sifting worker at the store resigned, Zhang Jifu had to do both minding the electric mill and sifting and carrying grain. This heavy workload often kept him working until midnight. Over time, Zhang Jifu felt that he could not handle it. Therefore, he raised his concerns with the manager, Bao Xintang, hoping that the situation could be improved. After raising the issue, Bao Xintang immediately notified the introducer and dismissed Zhang Jifu, ordering him to be taken back within a time limit. He was to be evicted from the store the next day.
　　At that time, after Zhang Jifu finished explaining the situation, comrades from this group went to the Houji Grain Store on the 22nd of this month to investigate in order to fully understand the truth of the matter. After an on-the-spot confrontation between the worker Zhang Jifu and the manager Bao Xintang, it was proved that what Zhang Jifu said was true. At the same time, Bao Xintang also admitted it without reservation. We immediately advised them to resolve the matter according to the law through the government and explained the New Democratic industrial and commercial policies in detail to the store manager, Bao Xintang. Then, we criticized the manager, pointing out that unjustified dismissal violated industrial and commercial policies and harmed the interests of workers. At this time, Bao Xintang guaranteed that he would no longer dismiss the worker and agreed to adjust working hours appropriately.

　　张继富复工
    本月十四日午后，北平市前门外厚记粮店的老工人张继富来本报社会服务组诉说他被该店经理鲍信堂无理解雇，目前生活无着。
    张继富原在东北当煤矿工人，去年始来北平，由友人介绍到前门外厚记粮店，看管电磨。今年由于该店一个筛粮工人辞职，张继富除了看管电磨外，还要兼做筛粮和扛粮。这样繁重的工作，常使他做到半夜。经常下去，张继富感到是没法支持的。因此他向经理鲍信堂提出了意见，希望上述情况能得到改善。提出之后，鲍信堂即通知介绍人，将张继富解雇，并限期领回。第二天即要驱逐出店。
    当时张继富谈完这个情况，本组同志为全面的了解这个事实的真象，特于本月二十二日亲往厚记粮店调查，经过工人张继富与经理鲍信堂当场对证，证明张继富所谈情况属实。同时鲍信堂。同时鲍信堂也直认不讳。我们即劝他们到政府依法解决。并将新民主主义的工商政策向该店经理鲍信堂作了详细的解释，继而对该经理进行了批评，指出无理解雇是违反了工商政策，与违害了工人利益。这时鲍信堂即保证不再解雇，并允适当的调剂工时。
