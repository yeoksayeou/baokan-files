[Jizhong Dispatch] Starting as early as December 21st of last year, the People's Liberation Army successively liberated ten towns including Jinghai, Duliu, Yangliuqing, Tangguantun, Xiaozhan, Gegu, Xianshuigu, Caozhuang, Lizhuang, and Liangwangzhuang. As of February 6th, revolutionary order has been established in all towns. In this stage, the following achievements and experiences have been gained: (1) A total of 57 agencies, factories, warehouses, stations, post offices, hospitals, etc., have been taken over. In Jinghai alone, 2,133 pieces of single and cotton clothing, 25,072 jin of grain, and some other materials were confiscated. (2) In terms of public security work, the first step was to collect and investigate weapons hidden by the enemy. According to statistics from Jinghai, Yangliuqing, and Jinnan alone, 15 machine guns, 496 rifles, and various other weapons such as automatic rifles, pistols, and small cannons were seized. The confiscation of these weapons relied on mass reporting combined with investigation. The unfolding of public security work is not only reflected in the aforementioned confiscation figures, but also overcame and corrected certain right-leaning tendencies, such as indiscriminately retaining personnel from puppet organizations without analyzing their backgrounds, failing to expose their past crimes to the masses in a timely manner, allowing many reactionaries to hide and infiltrate to obtain legitimate status, and so on. For example, puppet personnel in Jinghai privately hung up the "Town Office" sign, convened meetings of puppet chiefs, and illegally collected funds. Furthermore, some of our cadres blindly implemented elections before conditions were ripe, resulting in puppet organization personnel taking advantage of loopholes, oppressing the masses, and being "elected" as they were. Consequently, some puppet chiefs showed no signs of repentance. People who had been oppressed by the enemy for a long time were unable to raise their heads for a while, and developed some doubts about our policies. These right-leaning tendencies in policy implementation were quickly corrected, and the masses gradually began to stand up. (3) Mobilizing the masses to establish people's power was carried out through organizing mass production. When Duliu Yihezhuang destroyed the puppet organizations and puppet regime, it first organized the masses according to the production needs of the working people in fish management, solving their production difficulties. The seven newly liberated towns had approximately 4,000 unemployed workers and citizens without food, so they were organized to engage in transportation, sales, and other production activities. From then on, the broad masses relied on us even further, and the regime was established on this basis. (4) Necessary work has also been done in eliminating counterfeit currency, restoring industry and commerce, and stabilizing prices. In all newly liberated areas of the entire sub-district, counterfeit currency was completely eliminated around January 23rd. According to statistics from seven cities, all 1,997 industrial and commercial households (excluding peddlers and hawkers) have fully resumed operations. Duliu and Xianshuigu have even added 55 industrial and commercial households. In terms of trade, connections have been established with Tangshan, Cangshi, Huanghua, and other places. Products such as oil, meat, towels, and cigarettes from the old liberated areas have been transported and sold to the newly liberated areas, and the credit of currencies in neighboring areas has also been improved.

　　静海独流等新解放市镇
  　组织生产发动群众
    【冀中电】早于去年十二月二十一日开始，人民解放军即先后解放了静海、独流、杨柳青、唐官屯、小站、葛沽、咸水沽、曹庄、李庄、良王庄等十个市镇，截至二月六日，各市镇已建立起革命秩序。在这一阶段中获得了如下的成绩和经验：（一）共接管机关、工厂、仓库、车站、邮局、医院等五十七处，仅静海一处即收缴单衣和棉衣二千一百卅三件，粮食二万五千零七十二斤，及其他物资一部。（二）在治安工作上，首先是收缴和追查敌人藏匿的武器。仅据静海、杨柳青、津南三处的统计，就缴获机枪十五挺，步枪四百九十六枝，及自动步枪手枪小炮等各种武器。这些武器的缴获，是依靠群众检举结合调查得来的。治安工作的展开，不仅表现在上述的缴获数字，同时并克服和纠正了某些右倾偏向，如不加分析的一律留用伪组织人员，没有及时在群众中揭穿其过去的罪恶，使不少反动分子隐藏潜入以取得合法地位等等。象静海伪人员私自挂出“镇公所”的牌子，并召开伪保长会议，私自违法派款。还有我们的某些干部不等条件成熟，就盲目地实行选举，结果使伪组织人员钻了空子，欺压群众，又原封“当选”。所以有的伪保长竟毫无改悔之意。久被敌人压迫的人民一时不能抬头，对我们的政策发生某些怀疑。这种执行政策中的右倾偏向，很快纠正以后，群众逐渐抬起头来。（三）发动群众树立人民政权，是通过组织群众生产办法进行的。独流义和庄摧毁伪组织及伪政权的时候，首先根据劳动人民治鱼的生产要求进行组织，解决他们生产上的困难。新解放的七个市镇，约有四千多个失业工人和没饭吃的市民，就组织他们做运销和其他生产，从此广大群众更进一步的依靠我们，政权也就在这样的基础上建立起来。（四）在肃清伪钞恢复工商业，稳定物价方面，也都作了必要的工作。全分区所有新解放的地区，在一月二十三日前后就把伪钞全部肃清了。据七个市的统计原有一千九百九十七家工商业户（行商摊贩在外）已完全复业。独流和咸水沽两处还增加了工商业户五十五家。在贸易上已和唐山、沧市、黄骅等地打通。老解放区的油、肉、毛巾、纸烟等产品已运销到新解放区，友邻区的货币信用也提高了。
