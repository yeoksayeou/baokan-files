Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, March 19th: TASS reports: The Czechoslovak Trade Union, with over 3 million members, and the Romanian Trade Union, with 1.5 million members, both declared on the 16th that they welcome the convening of the World Congress of Supporters of Peace. The Romanian Trade Union declared: The Romanian working class is firmly determined to struggle against the imperialist aggressive plans to instigate a new war. Scientific workers at the Romanian-Soviet Institute and the Romanian Cultural Workers' Preparatory Committee for the Peace Congress expressed the same sentiment.

    The Amsterdam branch of the Dutch Communist Party held a meeting on the 14th and 15th to discuss strengthening the struggle against the government's war preparations, opposing the imperialist policies in Indonesia, and discussing measures to strengthen the trade union movement. The General Secretary of the Dutch Communist Party, De Groot, declared at the meeting: "If we immediately launch a peace offensive and can mobilize the masses against the war preparations carried out by the war profiteers, we can prevent war." The meeting passed a resolution stating that the Amsterdam branch of the Dutch Communist Party will contribute all its efforts to oppose war preparations and strive to stop the war against Indonesia.

    The Belgian Women's League for the Defense of Peace and other women's democratic organizations in Belgium have been conducting a petition signing campaign in industrial centers and other urban and rural areas. The petition will be sent to the United Nations. The petition states: "We want peace, we oppose the rearmament of Germany, oppose military buildup leading to war, and oppose the atomic bomb." The League's Executive Committee announced that a national conference for supporting peace and opposing warmongering will be held in April.

    In France, 200,000 letters to Truman requesting signatures are currently circulating in various regions. This is a movement initiated by the "League of Fighters for Freedom and Peace" with the aim of arousing the French people to oppose France joining the United States' war preparations. Dr. Longer, the grandson of Marx, wrote a letter to the League stating: "It is imperative to immediately inform the Americans that we, the millions of French people, will never agree to an anti-Soviet aggressive war."

    Members of the Norwegian Stonemasons' Union held a congress in Oslo and passed a resolution protesting Norway's participation in the North Atlantic Treaty and the government's rejection of the Soviet Union's proposal to sign a Soviet-Norwegian non-aggression treaty. The Labor Party youth organization in Troms province in northern Norway also submitted similar protests to the government and parliament.

    The German Democratic Women's League calls on all German groups to jointly take measures to form a German delegation to attend the World Congress of Supporters of Peace. The League welcomes the proposal to convene the Peace Congress, declaring that it will spare no effort to involve German women in the preparations for the congress.
