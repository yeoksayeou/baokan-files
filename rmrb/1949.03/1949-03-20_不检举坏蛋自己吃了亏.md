　　Not Reporting Bad Guys Leads to Personal Loss
    [Ping City News] At 2:00 PM on the 16th, a fire broke out at the "Datong News Agency" on Dongsi North Street. Fortunately, the patrol team living across the street found out and rushed to put it out, preventing a major disaster. According to the agency director, Wen Fangbei, the reason was as follows: A few days ago, Yang Hongsen, an editor here, brought two people: one was his fellow villager, and the other was a friend of his fellow villager. The two claimed to make a living by doing small business. Because they didn't have money to rent a house, they wanted to stay for a few days. Wen Fangbei agreed. Three days later, he learned that both of them were "military police," but he didn't report it, just wanted them to leave. Today, one of them returned to move a shelf they had brought, but failed. This "military police" was dissatisfied and secretly set a fire before fleeing. Wen Fangbei finally said with shame: "This is all my fault. Knowing they were bad guys, why didn't I report it!"

　　不检举坏蛋自己吃了亏
    【平市讯】东四北大街“大同通讯社”十六日下午两点钟的时候失了火。幸有对过住的纠查队得知，赶忙救熄，没成巨灾。其原因，据社长文芳北叙述是这样的：前几天，这里的编辑杨洪森领来两个人：一个是他的同乡，一个是他同乡的朋友。两人自己说是以做小买卖维生。因没钱租房子，要借宿几天。文芳北就答应了。三天后，他得知两人都是“宪兵”，但没报告，只要走就算完了。今天某中的一个人又回来搬他们带来的一个货架子未遂，这个“宪兵”不满，就偷偷地放了把火，潜逃了。文芳北最后惭愧地说：“我这结果，全是自找的。知道了是坏蛋，为什么不报告！”
