　　Truly Our Own Cooperative

　　[Ping City News] The Beiping Garment Factory Workers' Consumer Cooperative has been rapidly expanding its business in the twenty days since its operation. The cooperative has six branches, and employees and their families have generally become shareholders. The cooperative purchased and supplied to its members from the General Supply and Marketing Cooperative: 16,000 jin of flour, 63,500 jin of millet, 90,000 jin of corn flour, 5,000 jin of sorghum rice, 24,300 jin of peanut oil, 20,000 jin of salt, 20,000 bars of soap..., shielding them from the impact of rising prices. All the factory workers happily discuss, saying: "The cooperatives run by the Kuomintang in the past were cooperatives that deceived workers and sucked their blood; today, this is truly our own cooperative!"

    【平市讯】北平被服总厂职工消费合作社经营二十天来，业务迅速开展。该社共设六个分社，职工及眷属们普遍入股。该社曾向供销总社给社员购回面粉一万六千斤，小米六万三千五百斤，玉米面九万斤，高粮米五千斤，花生油二万四千三百斤，盐二万斤，肥皂二万条……，供给社员，使不受物价影响。全厂职工高兴的谈论说：“过去国民党开的合作社是欺骗工人、喝人血的合作社；今天真是我们自己的合作社！”
