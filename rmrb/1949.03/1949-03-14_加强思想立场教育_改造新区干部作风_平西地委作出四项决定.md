　　【Zhangjiakou Electric】The Pingxi District Committee of the Chinese Communist Party (including Liangxiang, Laishui, Zhuozhou, Fangshan, Wanping, and other counties) convened an enlarged cadre meeting on land reform in the new district in mid-February. The meeting examined and criticized the non-proletarian thoughts and work styles of cadres and party members in the new district. Some cadres who entered the new district work in Laishui, Zhuozhou, Fangshan, Liangxiang, and Wanping counties had unstable stances in implementing policies; some committed serious right-leaning errors. They dared not definitively publicize the Party's policies, indiscriminately used pseudo-Baos and Chiefs without distinguishing between the enemy and ourselves, and even shielded them, attacking the masses' just accusations against pseudo-Baos and Chiefs. Some cadres were corrupt and degenerate in thought. Furthermore, some county cadres had serious bureaucratic and administrative work styles and lacked discipline, and did not fully understand the situation at the lower levels. In order to combat these erroneous ideas, the District Committee made the following decisions at this meeting: 1. Mobilize each cadre to examine their own stance, thoughts, and work style from the Party's standpoint, temper themselves well in land reform, and firm up their revolutionary outlook on life. 2. Strengthen cadre learning, improve policy theory level, establish and adhere to a learning system, starting from leading cadres themselves to lead everyone. 3. Leaders should always pay attention to understanding the ideological situation of cadres, regularly conduct systematic ideological education, commend the good and support the righteousness, criticize, expose and eliminate bad ideas and bad work styles. Improve the organizational life of the organs and seriously promote criticism and self-criticism to carry out ideological struggles. Party committees at all levels must regard this work as one of the main tasks. Oppose the leadership method of only using cadres without educating them. 4. Rectify Party discipline and appropriately deal with party members and cadres who have made mistakes this time. However, the nature of the errors should be distinguished: the first is those who are good in essence and work actively, but commit mistakes unconsciously because they do not study and develop politically, or take a liberal attitude towards the mistakes of others; the second is those who are not good in essence, whose motives for joining the party are impure, and who consciously sabotage the Party's political influence. Adopt the principle of criticism and education for the former, and transform and improve them ideologically; for the latter, expose them within the Party and give them necessary disciplinary sanctions; those who are indeed class dissidents and incorrigible should be purged from the Party.

　　加强思想立场教育　改造新区干部作风  平西地委作出四项决定
    【张垣电】中共平西地委（包括良乡、涞涿、房山、宛平等县）在二月中旬召开新区土地改革扩大干部地，检查与批判了新区干部、党员中非无产阶级的思想与作风。进入涞涿、房山、良乡、宛平四县新区工作的部分干部，在执行政策中有的立场不稳；有的犯了严重的右倾错误，他们不敢肯定地宣传党的政策，敌我不分无原则的使用伪保甲长，甚至袒护他们，打击群众对伪保甲长人员的正义控诉；有的干部贪污腐化、思想堕落。而某些县的县干部则存在着严重的官僚主义和事务主义作风与无纪律现象，不十分了解下情。为了与这些错误思想作斗争，在此次会上地委特作以下决定：一、发动每个干部站在党的立场上，检查自己的立场、思想和作风，在土地改革中好好锻炼自己，坚定自己的革命人生观。二、加强干部学习，提高政策理论水平，建立并坚持学习制度，从领导干部自身作起，带动大家。三、领导上经常注意了解干部的思想情况，定期系统的进行思想教育，表扬好的扶植正气，批评揭发和杜绝坏思想、坏作风。健全机关支部生活，认真的发扬批评与自我批评，开展思想斗争。各级党必须把这一工作看成是主要任务之一。反对对干部只使用不教育的领导方法。四、整顿党纪适当处理这次犯错误的党员、干部。但对错误的性质不同应加以区别：一是本质上好工作积极，因自己不学习政治上不开展，不自觉地犯了错误，或对别人错误采取自由主义态度者；再有一种是本质不好，入党动机就不纯，有意识破坏党的政治影响者。对前一种采取批评教育的方针，从思想上改造和提高他们；对后一种人应在党内进行揭发，给以必要的纪律制裁；确系阶级异己分子和不可救药者就清洗出党。
