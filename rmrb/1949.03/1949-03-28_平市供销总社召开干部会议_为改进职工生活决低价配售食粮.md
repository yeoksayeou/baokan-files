　　Ping City General Supply and Marketing Cooperative Holds Cadre Meeting:
    Decides to Ration Food at Low Prices to Improve Employee Life
    [Reported by This Newspaper] The Ping City General Supply and Marketing Cooperative held a meeting of cadres from various public factories and cooperatives yesterday (the 27th), making specific regulations on factory cooperative business and guaranteeing employee supplies. First, in order to meet the demands of employees, such as items that state-owned enterprises cannot currently supply, each factory cooperative can independently carry out procurement. However, procurement must be done through introductions from the General Cooperative and the Trade Company to prevent affecting price fluctuations. Regarding how cooperatives can immediately guarantee employee supplies when issuing wages for the latter half of March, based on past experience and member requests, the following points are specifically stipulated: (1) When each cooperative purchases food and other daily necessities from the General Cooperative this time, in order to take care of the difficulties in the capital turnover of each cooperative, goods can be taken in advance and then paid for. However, when taking the goods, a list of members must be presented, stamped with the cooperative's seal, and a purchase list must be issued before the goods can be allocated. The payment must be cleared by the 10th of next month at the latest, and it is decided that from next month onwards, each cooperative must pay before taking the goods, otherwise no goods will be allocated. (2) In order to facilitate transportation procedures to and from taking goods and save on porterage fees, the allocation of grain and flour this time will be made at the consignment shops near each cooperative. (3) Cooperatives approved by the General Cooperative will be sold goods at prices 4% lower than those stipulated by the Trade Company. This 4% will be used as expenses for round-trip transportation, etc. (4) The quantity of grain purchased this time is stipulated to be 45 jin per employee per month and 35 jin per employee's family member. In terms of the type and quantity of food, employees can buy 15 jin of fine grains, and family members can buy 10 jin. Coarse grains will be specifically allocated to each cooperative according to the actual amount of grain available, while corn flour is not limited. In terms of grain prices, millet is stipulated to be 16 yuan per jin, rice is 30 yuan, millet flour is 15 yuan, corn flour is 14 yuan and 5 jiao, sorghum rice is 15 yuan and 5 jiao, white corn is 13 yuan, yellow corn (Northeast corn) is 13 yuan and 5 jiao, vermicelli is 1,550 yuan per bag (equivalent to 35 yuan, 2 mao, and 5 fen per jin), soybeans are 14 yuan and 5 jiao, buckwheat flour is 17 yuan, wheat is 28 yuan, and other daily necessities (soap, cloth, towels, etc.) are also sold at prices lower than the market price.

　　平市供销总社召开干部会议
    为改进职工生活决低价配售食粮
    【本报讯】平市供销合作总社于昨日（二十七日）召开各公营工厂合作干部会议，对工厂合作业务和保证职工供给问题作了具体规定。首先是为了满足职工要求，如目前国营企业不能供给的物品，各厂合作社可以单独进行采购，但采购时必须经过合作总社和贸易公司的介绍，防止影响物价波动。关于在发三月份下半月工资时，合作社如何即时保证职工供给，根据以往经验和社员要求，特规定以下几点：（一）此次各社向总社购买食粮和其他日用品时，为照顾各社资金周转困难，可先预取然后付款，但取货时，必须持社员名册，盖上合作社戳记，开出买货清单，方能批拨货物，款子最迟要在下月十日以前付清，并决定后下月起，各社均须先付款后取货，否则一律不拨。（二）为了便利取货时来往运输手续和节省脚力费，此次粮面拨付，均按各社附近代销站拨取。（三）为总社批准的合作社，购货时均按贸易公司规定价格低于百分之四售给，此百分之四作为来往运费等项开支。（四）此次购买粮食数量，规定每个职工每月为四十五斤，职工家属为三十五斤。在食粮种类和数量上，规定职工可买细粮十五斤，家属可买十斤。粗粮按实有粮食数，具体分配到各社，玉米面则不加限制。在粮价上，规定小米每斤十六元、大米三十元，小米面十五元，玉米面十四元五角，高梁米十五元五，白玉米十三元，黄玉米（东北米）十三元五，通粉每袋一千五百五十元（每斤合三十五元二毛五），黄豆十四元五，荞麦面十七元，小麦二十八元，其他日用品（肥皂、布匹、毛巾等）亦均低于市价售给。　　　（赵刚）
