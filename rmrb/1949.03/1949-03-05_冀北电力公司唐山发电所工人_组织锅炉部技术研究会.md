　　Jibei Electric Power Company Tangshan Power Plant Workers
    Organize Boiler Department Technical Research Association
    [Tangshan Dispatch] Workers of the Boiler Department of the Tangshan Branch Power Plant of the state-owned Jibei Electric Power Company have initiated the organization of a Boiler Department Technical Research Association. More than 20 engineers, construction workers, and workers from the department were invited to a meeting to study how to improve technology, exchange experiences, strengthen unity, and further develop business. On the 21st and 22nd of last month, they held two meetings. At the meetings, three shortcomings in the work were improved, enabling the research association to achieve results from the very beginning. Veteran worker Jia Zhendong pointed out that the sootblower nozzles of the ash hoppers were often burned out. He believed this was due to the thin air pipes and insufficient air pressure. The next day's inspection revealed that the air pipes were not thin, but were instead encrusted with thick layers of ash and rust, reducing the pressure and causing insufficient air supply. This was something no one had noticed for several years, so it was immediately improved. Worker Li Xiujun pointed out that the boiler igniter and the secondary ignition shared the same safety valve. The ventilation valve had to be opened and closed frequently, and sometimes sparks would fly due to excessive dust, which had caused danger twice. How should this be improved? After discussion, it was decided to open a two-way valve to avoid danger. Worker Geng Liantai also pointed out that the ash doors on the ash channel next to the boiler were often opened, resulting in a significant loss of heat. After research, it was believed that opening them once every eight hours would be sufficient to avoid losing heat inside the furnace. In addition, many precautions for maintenance and methods for using substitutes were proposed, all of which will be tested and implemented later. Everyone was very satisfied after the meeting. Han Jingqiao, the head of the construction work section, said, "The sootblowing door should have been closed, but it has been open for more than two years, and we haven't noticed it. The power of everyone is great." Fellow worker Geng Liantai said, "Such exchange of opinions has never happened in the power plant before. Directors, section chiefs, and workers sit together to study business. Everyone shares their past work experience, which cannot be found in books. This meeting should be held often in the future, so that we can learn a lot of things, and we will not be disunited with each other."

　　冀北电力公司唐山发电所工人
    组织锅炉部技术研究会
    【唐山电】国营冀北电力公司唐山分公司发电所锅炉部工人，发起组织一个锅炉部技术研究会，邀集该部工程师、工务员、工人廿余人，开会研究，如何改进技术，交流经验，加强团结，使业务进一步开展。于上月二十一、二两日，他们开了两次会，会上改善了三项工作上的缺点，使研究会一开始便获得成绩。老工人贾振东提出：灰器的吹灰嘴子经常被烧毁，他以为是由于空气管钗细空气压力不够的缘故。第二天检查的结果，空气管倒不细，而是其中结了很厚的灰壳和铁锈，减低了压力，使空气供给不足所致。几年来都没有人注意的事，于是立刻改善了。工人李秀俊提出：锅炉司火机与二次通火共用一个保险闸，通风闸经常要开关，因灰尘过多，开关有时冒火，曾两次发生危险，应当如何改善？经大家研究结果，决定从两分闸开以免危险。工人耿连泰又提出：锅炉旁灰道上灰小门，常打开，损失不少热量，经研究结果，认为每八小时开放一次即可，以免损失炉内热力。此外还提出许多检修注意的事项，和采用代用品的办法，都待以后试验办理。此次会开完后，大家很满意。工务课长韩景桥说：“吹灰门本应关着，但一直开了两年多，我们都未注意到，还是大家的力量大。”工友耿连泰说：“这样的交换意见，是发电所从未有过的事，主任、课长、工友坐在一起研究业务，大家都把每人过去工作经验讲出来，书上是找不到的。这会以后要常开，可以学习很多东西，彼此还不会闹不团结。”
