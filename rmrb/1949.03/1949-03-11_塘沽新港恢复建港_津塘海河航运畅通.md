　　Tanggu New Port Resumes Port Construction
　　Tianjin-Tanggu Haihe River Shipping is Unimpeded
    [Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, 9th] The Tianjin Port project of Tanggu New Port has been restored. After liberation, the port was officially taken over by the Tianjin Military Control Commission's Transportation Department. Immediately, 300 staff members and 1,500 workers reported for duty. The machine shop and shipyard began work on February 20th. In the past half-month or so, more than 40 reinforced concrete bunkers built by the Kuomintang bandit army near the factory have been completely cleared. Eleven landing craft, including "Shuixing No. 1" and "Xingang No. 28," have been largely repaired. Of the 117 machine tools that were abandoned or destroyed during the Kuomintang rule, some have been put into operation. Of the hundred or so port vehicles destroyed by the Kuomintang bandit army, the automobile repair shop has repaired five (including a ten-ton crane). The port affairs office's dredging team and the 700 aquatic and land workers of the Yunbo construction area salvaged the "Xingang No. 8" and other ships sunk into the sea by the Chiang bandit army. The workers not only enthusiastically carried out the rush repair work, but also actively donated materials and equipment; 24 workers donated 540 pieces of equipment and tools. According to the construction project of Tanggu New Port, during the Kuomintang rule, the New Port Engineering Bureau of the puppet Ministry of Communications reduced funding and drastically laid off employees, and a major part of the project was at a standstill.
    [Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, 8th] The short-distance shipping on the Haihe River between Tianjin and Tanggu began on the 7th. The "Guolang" and "Guowan" ships sailed between Tanggu and Tianjin respectively. Furthermore, inland river shipping in central Hebei will also begin within days. Recently, the Transportation Department of the Tianjin Military Control Commission established a Canal Shipping Group in the China Merchants Bureau and sent "Heyuan" and "Heji" ships to test-sail the Ziya River and Daqing River respectively. These two ships completed their test voyages on the 5th. The Grand Canal route will also be test-sailed recently.

　　塘沽新港恢复建港
  　津塘海河航运畅通
    【新华社天津九日电】塘沽新港的津港工程业已恢复。解放后，该港由天津市军管会交通处正式接管，当即有职员三百人工人一千五百人前来报到。机务处修船厂首先于二月二十日展开工作。半月余以来，国民党匪军在该厂附近所筑的四十余个钢骨水泥地堡已全部清除，“水星一号”、“新港二十八号”等十一艘登陆艇均大体修复，在国民党统治时期被废置或破坏的一百一十七部工作母机，亦已部分开工。被国民党匪军破坏的百余辆港用汽车，已由汽车修理厂修复了五辆（内有十吨起重机的吊车一辆）。港务处浚填工程队与云波大工区水陆工人七百人，打捞出被蒋匪军沉入海中的“新港八号”等轮船。工人们不但热烈地进行抢修工作，而且还纷纷献纳器材；有二十四名工人献交器材工具达五百四十件。按塘沽新港的建港工程，在国民党统治时，由于伪交通部新港工程局缩减经费，大肆裁撤员工，其中一部重大工程已陷停顿。
    【新华社天津八日电】天津与塘沽间海河短程航运，已于七日开始。“国稂”、“国宛”两轮，分由塘津两地对开。又河北中部内河航运，日内亦可开始。日前津军管会交通处已在招商局内设立运河航运组，并派出“河源”、“河济”两轮，分别试航子牙河、大清河。该两轮已于五日试航完毕。南运河航线最近亦将试航。
