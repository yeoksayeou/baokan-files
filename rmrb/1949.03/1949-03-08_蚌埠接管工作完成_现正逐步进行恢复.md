Xinhua News Agency, East China, March 3rd: The takeover of Bengbu City has been largely completed, and restoration is now gradually underway. After Bengbu City was liberated on January 19th, the departments under the Military Control Commission successively entered the city to carry out takeover work. At the same time, various restoration and construction projects in the city also began one after another. The Jianghuai Daily, the organ of the CCP Jianghuai District Committee, moved to the city and began publishing three days after the liberation of Bengbu. The Xinhua Bookstore also quickly began operations. The Industry and Commerce Department of the Military Control Commission released a large quantity of salt after entering the city to cooperate with the Finance Department in enhancing the prestige of the local currency. At the same time, the Finance Department achieved significant results in eliminating the fake Gold Yuan Certificates. The Jianghuai Branch of the Huadong Bank has moved to Bengbu City and opened for business. The market is now gradually stabilizing, and prices are generally declining. Among the sixty-one primary and secondary schools that have been registered, six middle schools and fifty-one primary schools are preparing to resume classes. Huadong University has recently established a Jianghuai branch in Bengbu City and has begun enrolling students. The post office and telephone bureau were immediately repaired and began operating after liberation. Thanks to the active repairs by more than 700 railway employees, the Bengbu-Hefei section of the Huainan Railway was opened to traffic shortly after liberation. After opening public shipping routes, the Shipping Administration Bureau also supported the resumption of private shipping. The Huadong Transportation Company has established a branch in Bengbu, and automobiles can reach Fuyang, Bozhou, Chuxian and other places. During this period, the municipal government successively distributed 2 million yuan in Huazhong currency and over 100,000 catties of relief grain, benefiting more than 10,000 impoverished people. More than 10,000 wounded soldiers abandoned by the Kuomintang bandit army have also been settled by the municipal government in coordination with the city's garrison command.

    【新华社华东三日电】蚌埠市接管工作已大体完成，现正逐步恢复。一月十九日蚌市解放后，军事管制委员会所属各部即相继入市进行接管工作。同时该市各项恢复与建设工作亦即先后开始。中共江淮区党委的机关报江淮日报在蚌市解放后三日即移至市内出版，新华书店亦随即迅速开始营业。军管会工商部在入城后曾抛出大批食盐物资，以配合金融部提高本币威信的工作。同时金融部在排除伪金圆券方面亦获显著成绩。华东银行江淮分行已移蚌市开业，目下市场已渐趋稳定，物价普遍下降。已登记的六十一所中小学中已有六所中学、五十一所小学正准备复课。华东大学近在蚌市设立江淮分校，并已开始招生。邮局、电话局均于解放后立即修复，开始工作，由于七百余铁路员工的积极抢修，准南铁路蚌（埠）合（肥）段于解放后不久即行通车。船舶管理局于开辟公营轮船航路后，并扶助民航复业。华东运输公司已在蚌设分公司，汽车可通阜阳、亳州、滁县等地。在此期间，市政府曾先后发放赈济金华中币二百万元，赈济粮十万余斤，受惠贫民达万余人。国民党匪军遗弃的万余伤兵，亦经市政府协同市警备司令部予以安置。
