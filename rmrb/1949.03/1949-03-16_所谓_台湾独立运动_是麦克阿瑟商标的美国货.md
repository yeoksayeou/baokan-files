Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, March 15th: The so-called "Taiwan independence movement," which has recently reappeared on the market, is an American product with the MacArthur trademark. On February 28th and March 1st, a small group of American running dogs, using the names of the "League of Taiwanese Students in Japan" and the "Alliance for the Re-Liberation of Taiwan," issued calls in Tokyo and Hong Kong demanding Taiwan's "independence" from China. The membership of these so-called Taiwanese groups would not exceed a dozen. Their ringleaders are the American lackeys Liao Wenyi and Liao Wenkui. This pair of American running dogs were originally large landowners in southern Taiwan who colluded with the Japanese government to bully the Taiwanese people and plunder their land during the Japanese occupation. After the Kuomintang reactionary government "took over" Taiwan, they transformed themselves into officials of the Kuomintang government, helping the Kuomintang oppress the Taiwanese people. Because their corruption and malfeasance were so blatant, the Kuomintang government was forced to remove them from their posts due to the hatred of the Taiwanese people. Liao Wenyi and Liao Wenkui studied in the United States in their early years and married American wives, thus gaining the favor of American imperialism. After Japan's surrender, they obtained a monopoly on selling American kerosene in Taiwan, becoming major compradores for American economic aggression in Taiwan. Subsequently, they were appointed as intelligence officers for American espionage agencies, traveling between Tokyo, Hong Kong, Shanghai, and other places, and for a long time have been specifically creating an atmosphere of demanding "Taiwan independence" in the name of the Taiwanese people. The so-called "Taiwan independence" is synonymous with the direct annexation of Taiwan by the United States. On February 10th, a Hong Kong newspaper revealed: "The United States is plotting a Taiwan independence movement and preparing to submit the so-called Taiwan independence issue to the United Nations, first allowing Taiwanese representatives to attend the Far Eastern Commission. The so-called Taiwanese representative has been designated by MacArthur as Liao Wenyi." The national scum Liao Wenyi and his ilk have recently reissued shameless calls for Taiwan's "independence" because MacArthur gave them orders.

### 所谓“台湾独立运动”是麦克阿瑟商标的美国货

　　所谓“台湾独立运动”是麦克阿瑟商标的美国货
    【新华社陕北十五日电】最近又一次在市场上出现的所谓“台湾独立运动”，是麦克阿瑟商标的美国货。上月二十八日和本月一日，一小撮的美国走狗用了“留日台湾学生联盟”及“争取台湾再解放联盟”的名单，在东京及香港发出了要求台湾自中国“独立”的叫喊。这些所谓台人团体，他们的会员不会越过一打。其首脑人物是美国奴才廖文毅及廖文奎兄弟。这一对美国走狗，原来是台湾南部的大地主，日寇统治时代勾结日本政府欺凌台湾人民，掠夺台湾人民的土地。国民党反动政府“劫收”台湾后，又摇身一变而为国民党政府的官员，帮助国民党压迫台湾人民。因为贪污舞弊罪恶昭彰，遭到台湾人民痛恨，国民党政府乃被迫将他们撤职。廖文毅、廖文奎早年曾留学美国，并娶了美国老婆，因而得到美国帝国主义的宠幸，在日本投降后取得了在台湾推销美国煤油的垄断权，成为美国对台湾经济侵略的大买办。随后他们就受任为美国间谍机关的情报员，往来于东京、香港、上海等地，许久以来即专门假借台湾人民名义制造要求“台湾独立”的空气。所谓“台湾独立”就是美国直接吞并台湾的代名词。上月十日据香港的一家报纸披露：“美国正在策动台湾独立运动，并准备将所谓台湾独立问题提出于联合国，首先准许台人派代表出席远东委员会，该所谓台人代表已由麦克阿瑟指定为廖文毅。”民族败类廖文毅之流最近重又发出要求台湾“独立”的无耻叫嚣，就是因为麦克阿瑟给他们下了命令。
