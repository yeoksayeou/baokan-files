　　Workers and Peasants in Fengtai and Other Places United
    Destroyed the Puppet Baojia Rule and Established People's Political Power
    [This Newspaper’s Report] After the liberation of Fengtai, the masses have been actively accusing the puppet Baojia personnel of extortion, embezzlement, aiding the enemy, conscripting soldiers, and other crimes, destroying the puppet Baojia rule and establishing a democratic government. Out of the original forty-three "bao" (now changed to villages or streets) in the district, thirty-three villages and streets have now, after accusations, successively established village and street people's democratic governments. Workers and peasants who were previously suppressed are now cadres in the new village and street governments, actively working for the people. Zhu Zhensheng, a worker from Fengtai Fourth Street, took the lead in cleaning up sanitation after becoming the street chief. Zhang He, the new village chief of Dawayao Village, swore to everyone: "I am a poor man and willing to serve everyone. Let's discuss things together."
    [Another Report] Through the two-month-long accusation movement, the people of Fengtai have unprecedentedly raised their awareness and established their own organizations—the trade union and the preparatory committee of the farmers' association. Out of the total population of over 30,000 in the district, the membership has now grown to over 5,000 (3,404 men, 1,998 women, excluding railway workers). Workers and peasants have begun to become the masters of the village. When the preparatory committees of the farmers' associations were established in various villages, the farmers sent plaques, couplets, congratulatory messages, and performed Yangko dances to show their celebration. When the farmers' association preparatory committee was established in Dajing Village, the farmers specially went to Beiping to buy a portrait of Chairman Mao and hung it in the venue. The joy of the workers and laboring people over their own liberation was overwhelming. Under the leadership of the farmers' association preparatory committee, they are now concentrating their efforts on solving specific problems in production and launching a production campaign.

    [Ping Municipal News] The workers and peasants of Dayu Village in the southeast of Mentougou District have now actively taken action to accuse the crimes of the puppet Baojia, destroy the puppet Baojia rule, and establish their own people's political power. The village is a semi-industrial and semi-mining area, and most of the young and middle-aged people are coal miners. Before liberation, a group of workers had already engaged in political and economic struggles with the reactionaries. After liberation, the military control commission's work team came to the village and first conducted a small-scale forum. The worker activists quickly united around the work team, and thirty-four young people formed a drama troupe to perform the facts of the chief of the joint guarantee (联保主任)’s extreme crimes of corruption and oppression of the people. Then they automatically proposed to destroy the puppet Baojia system and establish a democratic village government. Every member of the trade union and their families were mobilized: women mobilized women, young people mobilized young people, and old people mobilized old people. Zhang Pei's family mobilized sixty-four people in one day. Within two days, more than 900 people registered with the trade union to participate in the struggle. Subsequently, with the trade union members as the backbone, the masses were organized into groups for education. The targets they demanded to be attacked were Li Hongyao and other four extremely sinful chiefs of the joint guarantee, and the rest of the Baojia chiefs who were coerced and echoed could be forgiven by the people as long as they honestly and frankly bowed their heads to the people and reformed themselves. The most reactionary Baojia chiefs mentioned above not only did not bow their heads to the people, but instead used bribery and enticement, and sowing discord to sabotage. However, the awakened masses were highly vigilant. A Bao chief went to the home of the activist Bai Ruxu to entice him, but was sternly rejected. When the conference was held on March 3rd, the masses were extremely emotional. At the conference, thirty-nine people indignantly accused the four chiefs of the joint guarantee of corruption and oppressive behavior, forcing them to bow their heads and admit their mistakes in front of the masses. Finally, the work team announced that the puppet Baojia system was completely abolished, and on the spot, candidates for new village cadres were nominated, which were unanimously approved. The six new cadres took the stage amidst warm applause and were sworn in publicly, immediately handling the handover procedures with the puppet Baojia chiefs.

　　丰台等地工农团结一致
    摧毁伪保甲统治　建立了人民政权
    【本报讯】丰台解放后，群众纷纷控诉伪保甲人员敲诈贪污助敌抓兵等各种罪恶，摧毁了伪保甲统治，建立民主政权。全区原四十三个保（已改村或街），现已有三十三个村、街，经过控诉，先后成立村街人民民主政权。从前被压在石底下的工人农民，现在当了村街新政权干部，积极在为人民工作。丰台四街工人朱振生当了街长后，亲自带头打扫卫生。大瓦窑新村长张河向大家宣誓说：“我是穷苦人，愿意为大家服务，有事大家商量着办。”
    【又讯】经过两月来的控诉运动，丰台群众觉悟空前提高，并成立了自己的组织—工会和农会筹委会。全区三万余人口，现会员已发展到五千余人（男三千四百零四人，女一千九百九十八人，铁路工人不包括在内）。工人农民开始变成村里的主人翁。各村农筹会成立时，农民互送匾额、对联、贺词、扭秧歌，以示庆祝。大井村农民在农筹会成立时，特地到北平去买毛主席的肖像挂在会场上，工人劳动人民对自己的解放，欢欣若狂。现正在农筹会领导下，集中力量解决生产中的具体问题，开展生产运动。（刘刚、刘明、李太明、邓林）
    【平市讯】门头沟区东南的大峪村工农，现已积极行动起来，控诉伪保甲的罪恶，摧毁伪保甲统治，建立了人民自己的政权。该村为半工半矿区，大部青壮年都是煤矿工人。未解放前即有一部份工人与反动派进行过政治的、经济的斗争。解放后，军管会工作组来到该村，首先进行了小型座谈，工人积极分子很快就团结在工作组周围，有三十四位青年成立剧团，演出罪大恶极的联保主任的贪污和欺压人民的事实。接着他们自动提出摧毁伪保甲制度，建立民主村政权，工会的每个会员和家属都动了起来：妇女去动员妇女，青年去动员青年，老人去动员老人。张沛之一家人一天动员了六十四个人。两天内到工会登记参加斗争的有九百多人。随即以工会会员为骨干，把群众组成小组，进行教育。他们要求打击的对象，是李洪尧等四个罪大恶极的联保主任，对其余胁从附和的保甲长，只要忠实坦白的向人民低头，改过自新，即可获得人民原谅。上述最反动的保甲长，不只不向人民低头，反用收买拉拢、挑拨离间来破坏。但觉醒了的群众警惕性很高，一保长到积极分子白如绪家去拉拢，被严词拒绝。三月三日开大会的时候，群众情绪极高。大会有三十九人悲愤的对四个联保主任贪污的欺压行为提出控诉，使他们不得不在群众面前低着头，承认错误。最后由工作组宣布伪保甲制度彻底废除，并当场提出新的村干部的候选人，获得一致通过，六位新干部在热烈的掌声中上台，当众宣誓就职，即日和伪保甲长办理接交手续。
