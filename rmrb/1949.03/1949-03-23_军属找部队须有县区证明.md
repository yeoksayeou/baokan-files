Military Dependents Must Have County/District Certification

To Mr. Zhao Guangzhi:

Regarding your inquiry about locating someone in a certain troop location, due to relevant military secrets, we are unable to directly disclose this information. If you are a military dependent, you must have a letter of certification from the district or county government, and we will do our best to assist with your inquiry.

　　军属找部队须有县区证明赵广智君：
    你询问某一部队的驻地去找人，因有关军事机密，不便直告，如系军人家属，须持有区县政府证明信件，我们当尽力帮助询问。
