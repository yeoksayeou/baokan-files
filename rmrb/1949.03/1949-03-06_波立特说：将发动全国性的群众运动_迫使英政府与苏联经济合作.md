Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, March 4th: Reuters, London: Harry Pollitt, General Secretary of the Communist Party of Great Britain, pointed out in a report to the enlarged Executive Committee of the CPGB: What is happening now is not some peaceful development of ultra-imperialism, but the most acute conflict ever seen within capitalism. The British working class must not overestimate the strength of the warmongers, but the working class and its allies should organize mass actions. Pollitt called on all working people to unite to improve living conditions, immediately increase wages, increase social welfare and pensions. Pollitt warned that the Labour government has begun to attack the rights of the people, and he called on the Communist Party to defend the rights of trade unions and democracy. Pollitt demanded "a great expansion of nationalization" and suggested that the Communist Party put forward this demand in the election campaign. In order to force the government to organize economic cooperation with the Soviet Union and the new democracies, the Communist Party will launch a nationwide movement. This movement will coincide with a powerful peace movement. Pollitt said: "A British-Soviet alliance will make war impossible." Pollitt warned against underestimating the significance of future elections. The upcoming elections will expose the true colors of the right-wing Labour leaders. Pollitt said: The Communist Party's victory in the election depends on the extent to which the party organizes the masses to oppose the current Labour government. Pollitt declared: The Communist Party leads the mass movement to defend peace and improve living standards, and it must provide basic answers to basic questions. In order to provide these answers, serious theoretical education for party members is necessary. He self-critically said that the party had "shirked responsibility" for theoretical education. Pollitt concluded with Molotov's words, "All roads lead to communism," saying: "Let us strive to accelerate the victory of communism everywhere, to end the exploitation of man by man!"

　　波立特说：将发动全国性的群众运动
    迫使英政府与苏联经济合作
    【新华社陕北四日电】电通社伦敦讯：英共总书记波立特在向英共扩大执委会作报告时指出：现在正在发生的不是什么超帝国主义的和平发展，而是在资本主义内部出现的前所未闻的最尖锐的冲突。英国工人阶级决不可过高估计战争贩子的力量，而应由工人阶级和它的同盟军组织群众行动。波立特号召一切劳动人民团结起来，争取改善生活条件、立即增加工资、增加社会福利和养老金。波立特警告称：工党政府已开始向人民权利进攻，他号召共产党维护职工会和民主的权利。波立特要求“大大扩大国有化”，并建议共产党在大选的竞选运动中提出这一要求。为了强迫政府与苏联和新民主国家组织经济合作，共产党将发动一个全国性的运动。这一运动将与强大的和平运动同时出现。波立特说：“英苏联盟将使战争不可能发生。”波立特警告不要过低估计未来选举的意义。未来的选举将使右翼工党领袖们的原形毕露。波立特说：共产党在选举中的胜利，决定于党组织群众对于目前工党政府之反对的程度。波立特宣称：共产党领导群众运动，以保卫和平与改进生活标准，它必须对基本问题提供基本答案。为了提供这些答案，对党员进行认真的理论教育是必要的。他自我批评地说：党曾对理论教育“规避责任”。波立特最后用莫洛托夫的话“条条道路通往共产主义”作结论时说：“让我们努力加速共产主义在一切地方的胜利，以结束人对人的剥削吧！”
