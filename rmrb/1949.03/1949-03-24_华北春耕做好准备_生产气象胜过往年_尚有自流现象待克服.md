North China Prepares for Spring Plowing
	Production Climate Better Than in Previous Years
	Spontaneous Tendencies Still Need to be Overcome
[By our correspondent] After the land certificates were issued in the old and semi-old areas of the North China Liberated Area, confirming land ownership, the spring plowing preparations this year have shown a more enthusiastic and intense production climate than in previous years. Currently, spring plowing preparations have been launched on a large scale in most areas, and farmers have purchased a large number of livestock. The Taiyue District bought back more than 3,000 head of livestock from Zhoujiakou, Henan, and other places; in the Taihang area, farmers in the first and fifth districts of Xingtai alone exchanged 1,660 head of livestock from outside the pass with homespun cloth; the number of livestock in central Hebei, eastern Hebei, and other places has also increased. All areas attach great importance to livestock breeding: vigorously promoting breeding methods; holding symposiums for mating households; establishing livestock breeding stations; and resolving various specific difficulties. Julu County already mated 233 head of livestock last winter; the Taiyue Yicheng County United Cooperative established 16 livestock breeding stations, and has already mated 583 head. Experience has proven that areas with organized leadership have achieved results; on the contrary, if, like the Changwan Promotion Cooperative, they blindly provide the masses with livestock loans, the livestock will only be bought and sold, and the actual number will not increase. All areas are universally carrying out manure and firewood accumulation. As of the end of January, the Taiyue area had completed 60% of its manure accumulation target; in Zhaowangtai, Fuping, Chahar Province, farmers, in addition to completing their own manure accumulation plans, also provided two days' worth to 20 households of revolutionary martyrs, soldiers, and workers. However, according to reports from various areas, fertilizer is still insufficient, and leadership must be strengthened to continue to carry out the manure accumulation campaign. In many mountainous areas, the accumulated firewood can last for five months. Since last autumn, all areas have universally built water conservancy projects. Jinzhong restored nine canals, including Guanghui and Guangji, and dozens of branch canals; Chahar Province completed the construction of 26 canals, which can increase irrigated land by 17,500 mu; in Taihang's Qinyang and Wen counties, 90 li of the Luo River were dredged, freeing 49,200 mu of land from flooding; Wen, Qin, and Bo counties built 11 canals, with a total length of 224 li, increasing irrigated land by 16,900 mu; Hebei-Shandong-Henan dredged three rivers, expanding the cultivated area by 16,400 mu. The main reason why the above achievements have been made in the construction of water conservancy projects is that the leadership attaches importance to it, mobilizing and organizing the broad masses, everyone cooperates in construction, and specific difficulties are resolved. However, in the construction of the Rongzhen Canal in Quyang, because the masses were not mobilized and everything relied on loans, the masses also regarded the canal construction as "government-run," and as a result, 110,000 jin of loaned grain was used, and the canal construction plan was not completed. In terms of manufacturing agricultural implements: Fushan, Qinshui, Yicheng, Yangcheng and other places in Taiyue have already produced a number of finished products; Gaoping ironware (agricultural implements) has a large output and can be supplied to various places north and south of the Yellow River in large quantities; Fanshi, Hunyuan and other places in Chahar Province are organizing the rush production of carts; waterwheels manufactured in central Hebei are very popular with farmers.
	However, there are still some urgent problems in the spring plowing preparation work in various areas. For example, after some areas have formulated production plans, they have not conducted good research and discussion on how to organize forces, provide specific leadership, and ensure the completion of the plans. Some areas also failed to carry out in-depth mobilization among cadres and the masses when making arrangements, so that some cadres reflected that "it doesn't matter whether it is completed or not." In addition, many cadres in many areas have spontaneous thoughts about this year's great production campaign. For example, in the Taihang area, some cadres believe that after land reform, the masses will start production on their own; at the same time, after party rectification in the area, some cadres want to "take a break," and the phenomenon of extreme democracy has not yet been eliminated among some of the masses. Therefore, it is necessary to implement production mobilization work and overcome the erroneous view of laissez-faire.

### 华北春耕做好准备  生产气象胜过往年  尚有自流现象待克服

　　华北春耕做好准备
    生产气象胜过往年
    尚有自流现象待克服
    【本报讯】华北解放区老区半老区颁发土地证确定地权后，今年春耕准备中已表现了较往年更为热烈紧张的生产气象。目前，在大部份地区春耕准备工作业已大规模展开，农民们大量购买了牲口。太岳区从河南周家口等地买回牲口三千余头；太行仅邢台一、五区农民，以土布运至口外即换回牲口一千六百六十头；冀中、冀东等地牲口均有增加。各地对繁殖牲口非常重视：大力宣传繁殖办法；召开配种户座谈会；设立种畜站；解决各种具体困难等。巨鹿在去冬即交配二百三十三头；太岳翼城县联社建立牲畜配种所十六处，已配成五百八十三头。经验证明：凡进行组织领导地区都获有成绩；相反，如昌宛推进社，只盲目给群众以牲口贷款，结果牲口只买来卖去，实际并未增加。各地普遍进行积肥积柴。太岳地区迄一月底积肥已完成积肥量的百分之六十；察省阜平昭王台农民除完成自己积肥计划外，并给二十户烈、军、工属垫上两天。但据目前各地反映，肥料仍感不足，必须加强领导，继续开展积肥运动。山地不少地区，积柴可供五个月之用。去秋至今，各地普遍兴修水利。晋中修复广惠、广济等九道渠，及支渠数十道；察省完成二十六道渠的修建，可增加水地一万七千五百亩；太行沁阳、温县挑涝河九十里，四万九千二百亩地免于水患；温、沁、博修渠十一道，共长二百二十四里，增加水地一万六千九百亩；冀鲁豫疏河三道，扩大耕地面积一万六千四百亩。各他兴修水利所以获得以上成绩，主要由于领导重视，发动组织广大群众，大家合作修筑，并具体解决困难。但如曲阳荣臻渠的修建，因不发动群众，事事依靠贷款，群众也把修渠看成“官办”，结果用了十一万斤贷粮，修渠计划也未完成。在修制农具方面：太岳浮山、沁水、翼城、阳城等地，已制出若干成品；高平铁货（农具）产量很大，可大量供给黄河南北各地之用；察省繁峙、浑源等地组织赶制大车；冀中制造水车很受农民欢迎。
    但各地在准备春耕工作中，尚存在一些急须解决的问题。如某些地区订出生产计划后，对于如何组织力量，具体领导，保证计划的完成等，未能很好研究讨论。也有的在布置时，未曾在干部、群众中进行深入动员，以致有些干部反映说：“反正完成就完成，不完成也完成。”另有不少地区干部，对今年大生产运动存在着自流思想。如太行区，有些干部认为土地改革之后群众自己会搞起生产来；同时该区经整党后，有的干部想“歇一歇”，以及部份群众中极端民主现象尚未消除。因此必须贯彻生产动员工作，克服放任自流的错误观点。
