　　I Realized the Communist Party and the Workers are One Family
　　Female worker of Fanrong Factory, Li Shuyan

　　I am a female worker in a cotton mill. Before liberation, my family was very poor because there was no labor force. I started working in the cotton mill at the age of fourteen to make a living. Even with daily labor, I couldn't eat enough or dress warmly. The capitalists didn't treat workers as human beings. Once, I got sick and asked for leave, but the foreman said, "Just manage if you can! No leave granted." For the sake of survival, I had to keep working despite the oppression of the capitalists. At that time, there was another female worker who was about to give birth. Her request for leave was also denied. That female worker was on the night shift, and by eleven o'clock, her body couldn't take it anymore! When the section chief saw her, he pointed to the people nearby and said, "Quick, carry her out, don't spoil the factory's luck." I was very angry when I heard that. I thought: we come here to work because we have difficulties in life, but you bastards not only don't care, but also treat us like animals, and even say "ticklish words" (meaning you deserve to die). I saw the factory as a prison, and the workers as prisoners. Since liberation, we have been liberated from the locked dark prison (in the past, the doors were locked upon entering the factory). At the same time, with the help of the trade union and the administration, the lives of the workers have been greatly improved, such as the sale of daily necessities at 20% discount, especially for women, who get forty days of maternity leave with wages paid. This made the women feel that the Communist Party really cares about the workers, and they are very grateful. They are very motivated and work especially hard. Take me for example! I have always been dull and lifeless, the oppression of the rulers made me afraid to be lively, let alone talk to people; since the Communist Party came, I have seen every comrade, and they all help the workers very well. I realized that the Communist Party and the workers are really one family, there are no unspeakable words, and everyone is united like close relatives. Therefore, the workers in the factory are actively producing, to improve quality, support the front lines, overthrow the reactionary forces who oppress us as soon as possible, and strive to build a new China.

　　我认识了共产党和工人是一家
    繁荣厂女工  李淑燕
    我是纱厂的一个女工，解放前因家里没有劳动力，很穷，十四岁就入纱厂做工维持生活，每天劳动着，还不能吃的饱，穿的暖。资本家拿工人就不当人，有一次我生病去请假，工头说：能干就将就干吧！不准假。为了生活，受着资本家的压迫，也还得干。当时还有一个女工，快生小孩了，请假也不准假，那个女工是干夜班，到十一点的时候，她身体实在受不了啦！科长看见了指着旁边的人说：“快把她抬出去，不要冲了我们厂里的运。”那时我听了非常生气。我想：我们生活困难，才来这里作工，你们这些混蛋不但不关心，而且拿我们当牛马看待，还说些“痒痒话”（你死了活该的意思）。我看工厂好象监狱，工人好象囚犯。自解放后，我们从锁着的黑暗监狱里解放出来了（过去入厂就锁门）。同时，在职工会和行政上的帮助下，工人生活大大改善了，如配卖生活日用品八折，尤其是妇女，生小孩，产期四十天，工资照发，这样使妇女都感到共产党真是关心工人，她们都非常感激。工作时，情绪都很高，特别卖力气。就拿我说吧！从来就是死沉沉的，这是统治者的压迫使我不敢活泼起来，更不会对人讲话；自共产党来了，我见每个同志，对工人都很好的帮助，我认识了共产党和工人真是一家，没有不可说的话，大家就象骨肉亲密的团结，所以在厂内工人都积极生产，为提高质量，支援前线，把压迫我们的反动派早日打垮，建立新中国而奋斗。
