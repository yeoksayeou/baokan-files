Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, March 29th: Reports from various sources: Diplomatic representatives from ten Western European countries have been meeting in London since the 28th to discuss the draft organizational law of the so-called "Council of Europe" drafted by the Consultative Committee of the Western European Union. The "Council of Europe" is a political coordination of the Western European Union, and both are organizations used by imperialism to undermine the United Nations. Representatives from Britain, France, the Netherlands, Belgium, Luxembourg, Norway, Denmark, Italy, Ireland, and Sweden are participating in this meeting. It is expected that the meeting will last one to two weeks. If the meeting reaches an agreement, its common opinions will be submitted to the ten-nation foreign ministers' meeting in London in April for approval.
