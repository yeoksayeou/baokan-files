Impressions of "Nine Gowns"

　　The Peking opera script "Nine Gowns," which once caused a sensation in Northeast China and Tianjin, was finally presented to the people of Beiping for the first time on the 26th, thanks to the efforts of the alumni troupe of the School of Drama.

　　Precisely because it truthfully and historically exposes a scene of the dark crimes of Chinese feudal society, it provides people with class struggle education that has profound practical significance.

　　The content and plot of the play describe how Hua Zifang, a local tyrant in a certain county of Henan Province in the late Ming Dynasty, colluded with the corrupt official Qiao Zidong to seize Shen Dacheng's wife, Shen Niang. He falsely accused Dacheng of stealing his daughter's wedding trousseau – the "Nine Gowns" – and killed Dacheng, seized Shen Niang, angered Shen's father to death, and ruined the family. At the same time, others who were oppressed and victimized included Shen's cousin Xia Yuchan, Cui Jie, a long-term worker expelled from the Hua family, and Chunying, a maid in the Hua family. Many people groaned in the sea of suffering under the oppression of the Hua family, sighing, "When will we ever see the light of day!" Just as they were at their "wit's end," they happened to encounter troops under the "Rebel King" passing through the area, and the "unrighteous rich man" Hua Zifang was captured and killed. This is the simple outline of the play.

　　From the selection of this theme, it is clearly class-based, that is, the struggle of landlords oppressing peasants and peasants resisting landlords. Like a red thread, it runs through the entire play. In particular, the portrayal of the conspiracies and deceptions of feudal forces, their collusion, and their anti-people class essence is vividly and thoroughly exposed, interspersed with great satire and ridicule, which is relatively successful. For example, the corrupt official is portrayed as so vile and base – "Money is my ancestor!" Hua Zifang is portrayed as so sinister and vicious, like "King Yama," harming Dacheng, seizing Shen Niang, and even wanting to "uproot the weeds." Hua Er, the Hua family's lackey, is portrayed as a complete slave – "flattering superiors and bullying inferiors." When they performed how they plotted to harm, seize, and oppress Shen Niang, and oppress the long-suffering Chunying, the audience constantly shouted angrily: "Shameless!" "Bastards!" "Hit them!"... Some said: "There really were landlords and corrupt officials like that!" The success of this exposure lies in the fact that it is tortuous and complex, essentially explaining that the "trinity" of feudal bureaucrats, landlords and gentry, and their pawns constitutes an antagonistic class against the people, and their motives all include personal calculations – promotion and wealth, exploitation and enjoyment. At the same time, the secret resistance of some servants and maids in the Hua family, and even the tragedy of Chunying's suicide because she was at her "wit's end," further illustrates that although these people eat the "Hua family's" food, they are not all "Hua family" people. They are also in a position of being oppressed and are "of one heart with the poor." This can be proven by the fact that they are often beaten "black and blue," steal a seedling of Dacheng's "root," and let Shen Niang run away, etc.; and thus proves that the oppressors and the wealthy are a minority of the population, and they are not solid and isolated. One of the practical educational points of the play lies in this. It educates the people to deeply understand the reactionary cruelty,荒淫无耻 (degenerate and shamelessness), and aroused the people's courage to fight against the reactionaries, and at the same time, how to treat them differently: "Concentrate forces to strike at the few, and win over the majority."

　　The above is only one aspect. More importantly, it is how to specifically understand the painful experiences of peasants over thousands of years from the perspective of the oppression suffered by peasants, and why peasants must resolutely oppose the landlord class, and why the landlord class must be eliminated so that peasants can be liberated. This point is of particularly practical educational significance, especially for people who live in cities that are detached from and isolated from peasants. This can't help but remind me of a foreign story that wrote about how Tsar was foolishly unaware of the "hardships of the people." When he heard a beggar shouting "Hunger! Hunger!" in front of the palace gate, he ridiculously asked: "Why are you hungry? Why don't you eat?"... In fact, during the land reform in the liberated areas, some people also said: "The land was earned by others. Why should peasants divide other people's land?"... Not to mention the recent events, take the "Nine Gowns" of the late Ming Dynasty as an example. The corrupt official once interrogated Shen Dacheng with similar words: "Why did you steal the Hua family's wedding gown?" But where did the wedding gown come from? Isn't it the blood and sweat of the peasants? This fact is often covered up. They don't understand and don't want to know that those who live such degenerate and shameless parasitic lives are not the peasants, but precisely the landlord Hua Zifang. Those who live a life of working all year round without being able to eat their fill, borrowing money "voluntarily," and being "kicked out of the house" for failing to borrow are not the landlord Hua Zifang, but precisely the tenant farmer Shen Dacheng... Who created this human tragedy? Is it in accordance with "natural justice and human feelings"? Of course, this is not a personal "dispute" between one landlord and one peasant, but an irrational social system issue. However, this historical story selected representatives of two antagonistic class figures, and portrayed how peasants struggled and fought under the oppression of the landlord class. Therefore, the protagonists in the play cannot be generally said to be Shen Niang or Hua Zifang. Rather, in exposing the crimes of the feudal system, on the one hand, it shows how the landlords, represented by the landlord gentry Hua Zifang, cruelly oppressed and exploited the peasants. On the other hand, it shows the history of blood and tears of how the peasants, represented by Shen Dacheng and Shen Niang, struggled in poverty and suffering. This kind of historical fact not only appeared in the late Ming Dynasty, but also in 20th-century China – in the Kuomintang-controlled areas, weren't those like Hua Zifang, corrupt officials like Qiao Datong, and those who encountered the same fate as Shen Dacheng, Shen Niang, and Xia Yuchan... everywhere and vivid in our minds?

　　However, the difference is that the peasants' thinking at that time prominently featured an idea of "fate" – "the poor have a hard life." Therefore, at the beginning, it is difficult to see the peasants' clearer political goals, and the peasants' more organized struggle and strength. What is more obvious is Chunying's suicide by slitting her throat, Shen Dacheng's forced confession, Shen Niang's seizure, and Xia Yuchan being beaten into madness... But in the end, under the rescue of the "people's army," the tyrant Hua Zifang was eliminated, "revenge was taken, hatred was avenged," and "there was a chance to get ahead." This mainly relied on the rescue of the peasant armed forces and "the road for the poor will not be cut off!" But why were the peasants who were liberated in the late Ming Dynasty soon overthrown and pressed under the stone slab again? The play also gives us an extremely valuable historical lesson: that is, there must be the leadership of the advanced class – the proletariat – and a clear political program, so that the people's armed forces can be maintained and developed, and the peasants can be organized to resolutely fight against the feudal forces with a purpose, and achieve complete liberation!

### “九件衣”观后感

　　“九件衣”观后感
    曾经在东北和天津轰动一时的平剧剧本——“九件衣”，终于由戏曲学校校友剧团的努力，于二十六日和北平人民首次见面了。
    正因为它如实地历史地暴露了中国封建社会底黑暗罪恶的一幕，所以，给予人们以阶级的斗争的教育，是有着深刻的现实意义的。
    剧的内容和情节，是写明末河南某县一个恶霸花自芳如何与贪官污吏乔子侗狼狈为奸，为了霸占长工申大成之妻申娘，诬赖大成盗了他闺女出嫁的嫁衣——“九件衣”，而杀害了大成，霸走了申娘，气死了申父，害得家破人亡，同时被欺压受害的还有申之表姐夏玉婵、被花家驱逐的长工崔杰、花家丫环春英等，多少在花家压迫下的人儿在苦海中呻吟，自叹“何时有出头之日”！就在这“走头无路”之际，巧遇“闯王”部下路经此地，始被此“为富不仁”之恶霸花自芳捉拿杀死，这就是该剧的简单轮廓。
    从这个主题的选取上看，它是具有明显的阶级性，即地主压迫农民，而农民反抗地主的斗争，象一条红线，贯穿了全剧，特别是在刻划封建势力的阴谋权诈、狼狈为奸以及其反人民的阶级本质，是毕露毕肖，并穿插了极大的讽刺和挖苦，这是比较成功的。如把贪官刻划成那么卑鄙下贱——“钱就是我的祖宗”，把花自芳刻划成那么阴险毒辣，活象“阎王”，害了大成，霸了申娘，还要“斩草除根”。对花家走狗花二，则刻划得一幅奴像十足——“媚上欺下”。当演到他们如何谋害、霸占、欺压申娘、欺压忍气吞声的春英时，观众中不断发出愤怒的呼喊：“缺德货”！“兔崽子”！“打”！……。有的则说：“就是有那样的地主和赃官！”这个暴露的成功处，还在于它是曲折的复杂的，本质的说明了封建官僚和地主豪绅及其爪牙“三位一体”的构成为一个敌对阶级反对人民，而在其动机上则均包含有个人的打算——升官发财、剥削享受。同时，从花家一些仆役以及丫环的暗暗抵抗，甚至春英因“走头无路”而自杀的悲剧中，更说明了这些人虽吃的“花家”饭，并不都是“花家”人，他（她）们同样是处在被压迫的地位，而和“穷人一条心”，这从她们经常被打得“青一块，紫一块”，偷出大成的一苗“根”，又放跑申娘等等事实中，即可证明；并从而证明压迫者豪贵者是占人群的少数，而且是不巩固和孤立的。该剧的现实教育之一，即在于此。它教育人民深刻地认识了封建势力的反动凶残，荒淫无耻，激发了人民向反动者进行斗争的勇气，同时又应如何分别对待：“集中力量打击少数，争取多数”。
    以上仅是一方面，更重要的还是如何从农民所受的压迫方面，来具体地认识农民数千年来的痛苦遭遇，和农民为什么要誓死反对地主阶级，以及为什么必须消灭地主阶级使农民才能获得解放，这点，特别是住在脱离农村隔绝农民的城市里的人们，更具有现实的教育意义。这不禁使我记起一篇外国的故事里写着沙皇是如何愚蠢地不知“民间疾苦”为何物，当他听见一个乞丐在宫门前喊“饥！饥！”时，他可笑地发问道：“你为什么饥？为什么不吃饭？”……事实上，在解放区实行土地改革时，也曾经有一些人说：“土地是人家赚下的，农民为啥分人家的地？”……近的不说，就以明末时代的——“九件衣”来说，那个贪官也曾经以类似的话审问申大成：“你为什么盗花家的嫁衣？”但嫁衣从何而来，还不是农民的血汗？这一事实常被掩饰起来，他们不了解也不愿知道，过着那样荒淫无耻的寄生虫生活的不是农民而恰是地主花自芳，过着终年劳动不得一饱为借钱“随喜”，告贷无门而被“赶出门外”的不是地主花自芳而恰是雇农申大成……这种人间悲剧是谁造成？是否合乎“天理人情”呢？当然，这不是那一个地主和那一个农民之间的个人“纠纷”，而是一个不合理的社会制度问题。不过这个历史故事是选取了两种敌对的阶级人物代表，而刻划了农民如何在地主阶级压迫下的挣扎和斗争。因此，剧中的主人翁，不能笼统的说就是申娘或花自芳，而是在揭露封建制度的罪恶中，一方面表现了以地主豪绅花自芳为代表的地主如何残酷地压迫剥削农民的压迫史，一方面则表现了以农民申大成、申娘为代表的如何在穷困痛苦中挣扎的血泪史。这种史实，不仅出现在明末，直到二十世纪的中国——在国民党统治区里，象花自芳那样的恶霸，象乔大侗那样的贪官，象申大成、申娘、夏玉婵……那样的遭遇者，还不到处皆是，历历在目吗？
    不过所不同者，当时农民的思想凸出的是一种“命运”思想—“穷人命苦”、因此，开始时是难以看出农民较明确的政治目的，和农民较有组织的斗争和力量，而较为明显的则是丫环春英的自刎、申大成的屈打成招、申娘的被霸走、夏玉婵的被打成疯……但在结局时终于在“民军”解救下，铲除了恶霸花自芳，“报了仇，雪了恨”，“有了出头之日”，这主要是依靠了农民武装的解救而“断绝不了穷人之路！”但为什么明末时期解放了的农民又不久被打翻压在石板底下呢？从该剧中也给了我们一个极其宝贵的历史教训：即必须有先进的阶级——无产阶级的领导，和明确的政治纲领，才能使人民武装得以保持和发展，也才能使农民得以组织起来，有目的地向封建势力进行坚决斗争，并取得彻底的解放！
