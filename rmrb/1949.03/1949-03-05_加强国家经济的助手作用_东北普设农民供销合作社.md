Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 1st. Agricultural and handicraft supply and marketing cooperatives should only be established among individual farmers and independent and family-laboring handicraftsmen. Consumer cooperatives should be established among workers, citizens, and other working people. Recently, some farmers' supply and marketing cooperatives have been established in some areas of Heilongjiang, Songjiang, Jilin, and other provinces. On the one hand, they help national trade agencies purchase grain, and on the other hand, they sell surplus grain and sideline products for farmers and exchange them for means of production and other means of livelihood. The result of this measure will be to enable the national economy to lead the small commodity economy of farmers, and to enable some farmers to be free from the intermediate exploitation of merchants. Last year, the total grain output in Northeast China was more than 12 million tons. After paying public grain and keeping rations, farmers still have a large surplus of grain to sell in exchange for various means of production and means of livelihood, especially because the spring ploughing is about to begin, and this need is even more urgent. National trade agencies need to purchase large quantities of grain for the state to supply the front lines, factories, and cities. Farmers' supply and marketing cooperatives in various places have been rapidly established and developed under these circumstances. In Tai'an, Keshan, Hailun and other seven counties in Heilongjiang, 68 new cooperatives were established in less than a month. The amount of grain purchased by the Tai'an County Cooperative and Trade Company signed contracts with village cooperatives has reached 450,000 kilograms. The nine district cooperatives in the county first borrowed cloth, salt and other agricultural and household supplies from the trade company. The borrowed goods were converted into grain at a price, and contracts were signed to deliver grain on time. In order to support the development of cooperatives, the county trade company gives the cooperatives a profit of 5% to 10% according to the set price, regardless of whether it buys farmers' sideline products or grain from the cooperatives or sells goods to the cooperatives. In Bayan County, Songjiang Province, nearly one-third of the 32 cooperatives were established through grain purchases. When these farmers' cooperatives were established, the state-owned grain company first lent materials to supply farmers with daily necessities such as cloth, salt, and cooking oil. Farmers saw that the cooperative's goods were cheap and convenient to buy, so they went to the cooperative to exchange grain. These cooperatives have gradually become powerful assistants to state-owned stores. Among the cooperatives in Jiaohe County, Jilin Province, two different approaches have produced two different effects. The Wangjiagang District Cooperative of the county set up grain collection warehouses in various villages and sent vehicles to transport grain to the villages, so that some farmers who did not have vehicles and horses would not feel difficulty because they were unable to transport it. Farmers are very satisfied that they can exchange grain for cloth, salt, and other items at the grain collection warehouse of the cooperative in their own village. Therefore, the cooperative in this district purchased the most grain, and also developed two village cooperatives in the grain purchase work. The Lafa District Cooperative, which adopted another approach, started from the purely profit-making point of view. It did not care about transportation or grain collection when purchasing grain, and let farmers travel 40 to 50 miles back and forth to the county trade bureau to deliver grain. The cooperative only wrote IOUs on both sides to make profits from it. As a result, not only did the farmers suffer losses, but the cooperative's grain purchase plan was not completed, and it was not supported by the masses.

### 加强国家经济的助手作用  东北普设农民供销合作社

　　加强国家经济的助手作用
    东北普设农民供销合作社
    【新华社沈阳一日电】农业的和手工业的供销合作社，只应该在个体农民中及独立的与家庭劳动的手工业者中建立。在工人、市民及其他劳动人民中，则应该建立消费合作社。最近在黑龙江、松江、吉林等省部分地区已建立了一些农民供销合作社，一方面帮助国家贸易机关购买粮食，另一方面替农民销售多余食粮及副业生产品，并为其换取生产资料和其他生活资料。这种措施的结果将使国家经济实现对于农民小商品经济的领导，使部分农民得以免除商人的中间剥削。全东北去年产粮食一千二百多万吨，除交纳公粮和留下口粮以外，农民还有很大一部分余粮需要出卖，以换取各种生产资料与生活资料，特别是因为春耕即将开始，此种需要更为迫切。而国家贸易机关则需要替国家购买大批粮食以作供给前线、工厂和城市之用。各地农民供销合作社即在此情况下迅速建立和发展起来。黑龙江的泰安、克山、海伦等七县不到一个月就新建立起合作社六十八处。泰安县合作社、贸易公司与村合作社订立契约之购粮额已达四十五万公斤。该县有九个区合作社先向贸易公司赊布、盐及其他农家用品，赊的货物按价折成粮食，订立契约按期交粮。该县贸易公司为扶助合作社发展，不论收买合作社的农民副业产品或粮食及卖给合作社货物，都按订价给合作社百分之五到百分之十的利润。松江省巴彦县三十二个合作社中，通过购粮成立起来的差不多占三分之一。这些农民合作社成立时，先由国营粮食公司借给物资，供给农民布匹、食盐、食油等日用品。农民看到合作社东西便宜，购买方便，就纷纷到合作社以粮食交换。这些合作社已逐渐成为国营商店的有力助手。在吉林省蛟河县的合作社中，有两种不同的做法，产生了两种不同的效果。该县王家岗区合作社在各村设立收粮仓库，派车到各村运粮，使有些没有车马的农民不致因为无力运输而感受困难。农民在自己村里就能把粮食向合作社的收粮仓库换成布、盐等东西，感到非常满意。因此，该区合作社购到的粮食最多，并且还在购粮工作中发展了两个村合作社。另一种做法的拉法区合作社则从单纯营利观点出发，购粮时既不管运送也不管收粮，让农民自己往返四五十里到县贸易局去送粮食。合作社只是两边写字据，从中取利。结果不但农民吃亏，合作社购粮计划没有完成，也不为群众所拥护。
