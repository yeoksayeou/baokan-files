　　Ji Central Hebei Holds Health Conference
    [Report from this newspaper] The Ji Central Hebei Health Bureau convened a region-wide health conference on February 21st. Attendees included the heads of civil affairs sections from each special district, county, and city, directors of medical associations, and representatives from public hospitals and pharmaceutical cooperatives, totaling 92 people from 52 units. Prior to the meeting, cadres generally lacked sufficient attention to and confidence in health work. At the conference, Deputy Director Gao first conveyed the resolutions of the North China Health Conference. Director Duan reported on the opinions regarding the development of health work in Ji Central Hebei this year, and experiences were exchanged in thematic speeches, and some methods for overcoming difficulties were obtained. Everyone began to have confidence and determination. The conference also decided: (1) The focus of health work this spring is mainly epidemic prevention and vaccination. Vaccine lymph will be uniformly issued by the Health Bureau and administered free of charge. All regions are required to make preparations for vaccination before March 15th and complete vaccination around April 15th. (2) Consolidate and develop pharmaceutical cooperatives. In areas without county-level or municipal-level pharmaceutical cooperatives, efforts should be made to establish them by the end of June without affecting epidemic prevention and vaccination work. Counties and cities that already have public pharmaceutical cooperatives should conduct adjustments and development. (3) Women's and infant health work must be widely publicized in conjunction with the Women's Federation to improve their health knowledge and break superstitions and unhygienic habits. (4) It is necessary to unite, educate, and reform old doctors, appropriately take care of their support for the front and attendance, and further promote their enthusiasm for serving the people.
