Cattle Plague Discovered in Various Parts of North China
Urgent Need to Organize the Masses to Eradicate It
[Special Dispatch from this Newspaper] Severe cattle plague has been discovered in several areas of North China. According to a report received from the Chahar Provincial Government on February 3rd, cattle plague broke out in the Duolun area of the region in early February, killing more than 1,000 head at that time. Later, the North China Animal Disease Prevention and Treatment Office, a subordinate body of the Agriculture and Water Conservancy Department of the Beiping Military Control Commission, dispatched nine cadres and several technicians to carry out prevention and treatment work. They departed from Zhangjiakou in two routes: The first route was to the Zhangbei, Baoyuan, Chongli, Duolun and other areas of the Chabei region. According to reports, more than 5,000 head have died in that area, and there are no reports on the prevention and treatment situation; the second route was to the Chicheng and Sihai areas of the Jicha region. Chicheng and Sihai have completed the prevention task for more than 5,000 head of cattle, but the cattle plague has begun to spread to Longguan, Huairou, and south of the Great Wall. People have now been sent to Huairou to investigate the epidemic. In addition, there are also alerts from Xianghe in eastern Ping, and Heshun in southeastern Shanxi. Looking at the overall situation in North China, the epidemic started in the northwest and is now spreading eastward and southward, and it is also breaking out in the northern part of the Yellow River. With this pincer attack from the north and south, if emergency measures are not taken, the cattle plague in the North China region will seriously affect this year's spring plowing. Therefore, local governments and epidemic prevention agencies must pay close attention to this issue, strictly establish an intelligence system, and once animal diseases are discovered in any area, they must be quarantined and reported quickly to ensure that the disaster does not spread outward, and try to eradicate it as soon as possible.

　　华北各地发现牛瘟
    急需组织群众扑灭
    【本报特讯】华北区若干地区发现严重牛瘟。据二月三日接获之察哈尔省府报告称，该区多伦一带于二月初旬发生牛瘟，当时即死千余头。后由北平军管会农业水利处接管机关华北兽疫防治处先后派干部九人，技工数人，前往防治，由张家口分两路：第一路为察北区之张北、宝源、崇礼、多伦等地区，据报告该区已死亡五千余头，防治情况，尚无报告；第二路是冀察区之赤城、四海一带，赤城、四海完成五千余头的预防任务，但牛瘟又开始向龙关、怀柔及长城以南蔓延，现已派人去怀柔调查疫情。另外平东香河、晋东南和顺也有警报。按华北总的情况看，疫情先由西北部发起，现往东往南部蔓延，而黄河北部也在发作。这样南北夹攻，华北区的牛瘟要不采紧急措施，将会严重影响今年春耕。因此，各地政府及防疫机关必须密切注意这一问题，严格建立情报制度，各地一经发现牛病，一面隔离，一面迅速上报，保证灾情不向外蔓延，并设法尽速扑灭。
