The Female Hero Who Persisted in the Struggle Against the Enemy
    --Introducing Li Xiu, a Woman Representative from the Hebei-Shandong-Henan Region

Comrade Li Xiu, who attended the Hebei-Shandong-Henan Region Women's Congress and was elected as a representative to the National Women's Congress, is a female hero who persisted in the struggle against the enemy in the establishment of Xin County (Xin She County, formerly the combination of parts of Shan County). In the autumn of 1947, when Chiang Kai-shek's bandits suffered repeated defeats north and south of the Longhai Railway, we launched a major sabotage campaign against the railway to cut off Chiang Kai-shek's important supply line. At that time, Comrade Li Xiu was the head of the work team in Xiazhuang, Shan County. In order to complete this task, she resolutely took on the position of militia instructor of a company. To avoid bombing and strafing by Chiang Kai-shek's planes, they worked at night. In addition to directing the road demolition work, Comrade Li Xiu also seized the time to pick up a pickaxe and break the road. Returning to the village at dawn, Comrade Li Xiu was unwilling to rest and went to mobilize the local masses, helping to solve the difficulties of insufficient supplies for the laborers. She persevered in this way for eight consecutive days, finally completing the task victoriously.

In the Zhangxia area, Comrade Li Xiu not only mobilized the masses to overthrow their status and seize land but also organized mass armed forces. She personally led the militia to strike at the Chiang Kai-shek bandits who came to disturb and loot grain, protecting the interests of the masses. Last summer, Chiang Kai-shek's bandits used their Fifth Army to carry out extremely cruel "encirclement and suppression sweeps" in the Hebei-Shandong-Henan area, north and south of the Yellow River. Comrade Li Xiu led cadres and militiamen to persist in the struggle. During the most brutal time of the struggle, she squatted in underground bunkers during the day and came out at night to carry out loan distribution, appeasement, and propaganda and encouragement work, persisting in the struggle against "encirclement and suppression" and "sweeps" for forty-five days. Soon, the bandit army began its second "encirclement and suppression." She again led cadres and militiamen to maneuver with the enemy and ambush small groups of enemies. On one occasion, she led three cadres and four militiamen to transfer to Liusilou Village, where they were surrounded and attacked by two groups of bandits. However, under her resourceful, calm, and courageous leadership, they safely broke through the encirclement.

Comrade Li Xiu is from Pei County, Jiangsu Province. In the early days of the War of Resistance Against Japan, her parents participated in the anti-Japanese work, and she was fostered in her uncle's home. Her uncle arranged a marriage for her, which she resolutely refused. After running away, she found her mother, studied in elementary school, and participated in the revolutionary work a year later. Because of her continuous hard work, she can now not only read newspapers but also write articles for them. She is currently the deputy director of the Women's Department of Shan-Yu County.

　　坚持对敌斗争的女英雄
    ——介绍冀鲁豫妇女代表李秀
    出席冀鲁豫区妇女代表大会，被选为出席全国妇女代表大会代表的李秀同志，是坚持设新县（新设县，原单县设县各一部）对敌斗争中的女英雄。一九四七年秋，蒋匪在陇海铁路南北连吃败仗时，我们为了切断蒋匪的重要补给线——陇海路，发动了对该路的大破击。当时，李秀同志在单县夏庄任工作组长，为了完成这一任务，她毅然担承了一连民兵指导员的职务。他们为了避免蒋匪飞机的轰炸扫射，都是在夜晚去工作。李秀同志除往来指挥破路工作外，并抓紧时间拿起铁镐破路。拂晓返回村，李秀同志还不肯休息而去发动当地群众，帮助解决了民工给养不足的困难。就这样一连坚持了八天，终于胜利地完成了任务。
    李秀同志在张夏一带，不仅发动群众闹翻身分土地，而且还组织了群众武装，她亲自率领着民兵打击出扰抢粮的蒋匪军，保卫了群众利益。去年夏季，蒋匪以其第五军对冀鲁豫河南北地区，实行了极其残酷的“清剿扫荡”，李秀同志即领导干部、民兵，坚持斗争，在斗争最残酷时，她白天蹲地洞，晚上出来进行贷款、安抚与宣传鼓励工作，一直坚持了四十五天的反“清剿”、反“扫荡”斗争。不久，匪军又开始了第二次“清剿”，她又率领干部、民兵与敌周旋，伏击小股敌人。有一次她带领三个干部和四个民兵刚转移到刘四楼村，即被两股匪军包围夹击，但在她的机智、沉着、勇敢的带领下，安全突出了重围。
    李秀同志是江苏省沛县人，抗战初期父母参加抗日工作，她被寄养在伯父家中，伯父给她包办订婚姻，她坚决拒绝后，跑出来找到了母亲，在小学读书，一年后即参加了革命工作，由于她不断努力学习，现在不仅能看报，还给报纸写稿。现在她担任单虞县妇女部副部长的职务。
