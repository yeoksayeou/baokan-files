Xinhua News Agency, Beiping, 1st. Residents of Taiwan in Beiping held a "February 28th" Revolution second anniversary commemoration meeting at 2 p.m. on the 28th in the auditorium of the Beiping Art School. Zhao Yimin, Head of the Propaganda Department of the Beiping Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, and democratic figures Chen Qiyuan, Zhang Naiqi, Tian Han, and An E attended and spoke. The meeting passed a congratulatory telegram to Chairman Mao of the Chinese Communist Party, Commander-in-Chief Zhu of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, and all commanders and fighters, and issued a letter to compatriots across the country stating: The remaining forces of the Kuomintang, in order to maintain their reactionary rule, are despicably concluding secret agreements with American imperialism, attempting to sell Taiwan to American imperialism and turn Taiwan into a colony of American imperialism. Currently, Taiwanese workers can only earn one jin of rice per day, and Taiwanese farmers have to hand over all rice except for what they eat themselves, so that the reactionaries can train troops to massacre the people. If we want to crush the reactionary rule of the last stronghold of the Kuomintang reactionaries, Taiwan can only be liberated and the Taiwanese people can only obtain true democracy and freedom under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and the great victory of the Chinese People's Liberation Army.

  　纪念“二、二八”革命
    【新华社北平一日电】留平台湾同胞于二十八日下午二时，在北平艺术专科学校大礼堂举行“二、二八”革命二周年纪念大会。中共北平市委宣传部长赵毅敏及来平民主人士陈其瑗、章乃器，田汉、安娥等出席讲话。大会通过向中国共产党毛主席中国人民解放军朱总司令及全体指战员致敬电，并发表告全国同胞书称：国民党的残余势力，为要维持他们的反动统治，正在卑鄙的和美帝国主义订立密约，企图将台湾出卖给美帝国主义，变台湾为美帝国主义的殖民地。现在台湾工人每天一人只能赚到一斤米，台湾农民除了自己吃的米以外全部都得交出来，好让反动派去练兵屠杀人民。我们要粉碎国民党反动派的最后堡垒的反动统治，只有在中国共产党的领导及中国人民解放军的伟大胜利之下，台湾才会得到解放，台湾人民才能得到真正的民主与自由。
