[Taiyue Electric] In Jiyuan, the construction of water conservancy projects such as the He River has begun. In the first ten days of work, more than 5,000 mu of wetland have been turned into fertile land, completing a quarter of the entire plan. Before the start of work in various villages, the masses felt that the project was too large (requiring more than 40,000 workdays), and that eating and drinking would be difficult, fearing that it would be difficult to persist. The Water Conservancy Committee immediately stated that the government would allocate 1,000 shi of grain for assistance. This immediately boosted the morale of the masses. Some people said to the cadres: "If you lead us to complete the He River this year, we will definitely erect a monument and plaque for you." The Water Conservancy Committee also formulated reasonable methods for work assignment, evaluation, and acceptance of work based on the opinions of the masses. For example, in Miaodian, Fanzhuang, Yongtai and other villages, it was decided that households that could irrigate the land would be assigned work, more work for more land, less work for less land. Those with labor who participated in digging the river could offset work, compensating for shortfalls. Those without labor paid wages. For military dependents and families of martyrs who truly had no labor and were experiencing difficulties, the entire village would contribute on their behalf. Households that could not irrigate the land could earn wages, which were determined based on the difficulty, depth, and width of the project, with wages paid according to measurements. During acceptance of work, any work that did not meet the specified standards was immediately reworked until it was completed before being accepted and accounted for. Some people reflected: "This year's methods are very good and fair. It has never been done like this in hundreds of years." Because each village has wetlands, everyone wanted to repair the rivers and channels in their own village first. The leadership explained to the masses that in the past, everyone wanted to do it first, resulting in no one being able to do it and everyone suffering. Therefore, it was decided to prioritize the most important areas and set a completion time, implementing a contract system to concentrate efforts on completing one area before moving on to another. For example, Cheng Village is divided into five communities: South, North, East, West, and Central, all of which have wetlands. However, the Central and South communities have more than 700 mu of wetlands. If the rivers and channels are dug, they can both irrigate the land and prevent flooding. Therefore, the South community was first lent 80 shi of grain to start work. Due to the leadership's step-by-step and focused approach, and the reasonable work evaluation and assignment, there are now more than 1,200 people regularly participating in the river repair project in various villages, one-third of whom are women. It is estimated that the 24 villages that have already started work in the county can reclaim more than 20,000 mu of wetland. Currently, Yongtai Village has already dug two channels with a total length of 890 zhang, reclaiming 750 mu of land in the village. Miaodian and other four villages have completed half of their tasks, reclaiming approximately 3,500 mu of land. Renzhai and other five villages that have just started work have also reclaimed 1,000 mu of land. All preparations are in place, and Nanji and other thirteen villages are about to start work.

　　济源拨粮千石兴修水利
    五千亩湿地变良田
    派工评工合理大批妇女参加
    【太岳电】济源兴修水利河等水利建设工程，动工十日中，已使五千余亩湿地变为良田，完成全部计划四分之一。各村动工之前，群众觉得工程太大（需工四万以上），吃喝困难，恐难坚持。水利委员会当即声明，政府将拨发一千石粮扶助，这样群众情绪马上提高，有的群众对干部说：“今年你们领导把河挑成，一定要给你们立碑挂匾。”水利委员会又根据群众意见，定出合理的派工、评工、交工等办法，如苗店、樊庄、永太等村，决定能浇地的户摊工，地多的多摊，地少的少摊，有劳力参加挑河的顶工，长除短补，没劳力的出工资，真正没有劳力，生活困难的军烈属，由全村代出，不能浇地的户，可赚工资，按工程难易，深浅宽窄，以尺寸评工得资。交工时，不适合尺度规定的马上重修，直到修好后，才能交工算帐。有的群众反映：“今年的办法很好很公道，几百年也没这样做过。”因为各村都有湿地，都想先修理自己村社的河道，领导上给群众说明，过去就是因为谁家也想先做，结果谁家也做不成，都受了害。因此决定哪里重要先搞哪里，规定完成时间，实行包工制，集中大力完成一处，再做别处。如程村分南、北、东、西、中五社，都有湿地，但中、南社有七百多亩湿地，如挑开河道既能浇地，又能防止水淹。因此，首先贷给南社八十石粮，先行动工。由于领导上有步骤、有重点，评工、派工合理，目前各村参加修河工程的经常有一千二百余人，其中有三分之一是妇女。现在，估计全县已动工的二十四个村子，可救出湿地二万余亩。目前永太村已挑开渠道两条，全长八百九十丈，救出本村土地七百五十亩。苗店等四个村，已经完成一半任务，约救出土地三千五百亩，开始动工的任砦等五村，亦已救出地一千亩。一切准备就绪，将要开工的尚有南稷等十三村。
