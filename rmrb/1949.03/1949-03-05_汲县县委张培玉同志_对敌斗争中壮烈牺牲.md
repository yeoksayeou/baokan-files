[Taihang Telegram] Comrade Zhang Peiyu, Secretary of the Jixian County Committee of the Communist Party of China, led a work team on January 1st to mobilize the masses in Zhifang Village in the county to complete the public grain quota. They were surrounded by enemies who had invaded from Xinxiang. He immediately fought heroically with the enemy, and was unfortunately captured during the breakout. He was brutally murdered by the dying Chiang Kai-shek bandits of the 318th Regiment of the 40th Army in Lizhuang Village. Upon hearing the news, the Fifth Prefectural Committee of the Communist Party of China in Taihang sent condolences and notified all Party members in the area to learn from Comrade Peiyu's heroic spirit of unyielding in the face of death, calmly facing execution, and not fearing sacrifice for the victory of the people's revolution, as well as his loyalty to the Party and the people. They should lead the masses to step up the current struggle, strive to completely eliminate the remaining bandits in northern Henan, and fight for the early victory of the Chinese revolution. Comrade Peiyu was from Lincheng, Hebei, 36 years old, from a petty merchant background, and joined the Communist Party of China in 1938. He successively served as organization member of the sub-committee, secretary of the district committee, director of the Public Security Bureau, inspector of the Public Security Department, secretary of the Anyang County Committee and concurrently secretary of the district committee, and chief of the directly subordinate section of the Organization Department of the prefectural committee, and secretary of the Jixian district, etc. During the eight-year War of Resistance Against Japan and the two-and-a-half-year People's Liberation War, Comrade Peiyu led the people in the border areas for a long time, waged arduous struggles with national enemies and class enemies to protect the interests of the people, strive for the people's democratic and free life, and realize the ultimate ideal of a communist society. In 1947, he made "leftist" errors and was removed from his post as county committee member during the Party rectification in January 1948. Comrade Peiyu accepted the Party's education over the past year and had recognized and corrected his mistakes in his practical work. He corrected his policies and ideology. Therefore, the prefectural committee decided in early January 1949 to revoke his punishment and promote him to the county committee, and was also elected as chairman of the Jixian County Farmers Association, but unfortunately sacrificed before taking office.
