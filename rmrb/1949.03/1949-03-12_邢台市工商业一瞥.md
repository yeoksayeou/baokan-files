　　A Glimpse of Industry and Commerce in Xingtai City
　　Tian Liu
　　Before the War of Resistance Against Japan, Xingtai was the largest commercial city in southern Hebei and one of the most famous fur markets in the country. Furs were sold to various provinces in the Northeast and Southeast, as well as to European countries such as England, France, and Germany, with an annual transaction volume of over 600,000 pieces. During the Japanese occupation, the number of industrial and commercial households in the city decreased from 1,270 before the war to 934. The fur industry was completely destroyed under the guise of "military use," while the number of foreign goods businesses increased to 796, accounting for 69% of the city's total capital. At that time, Xingtai was completely transformed into a colonial market.
　　After liberation, under the leadership and assistance of the democratic government, Xingtai's industry and commerce experienced tremendous development. From the time of liberation until May 1947, in just over a year, foreign consumer goods were basically eliminated in Xingtai. Replacing them were various industries, handicrafts, and industries closely related to rural areas, such as mountain goods, medicinal materials, furs, hemp shops, and iron goods, whose capital now accounts for 91% of the total capital. The number of factories and workshops, large and small, has grown to over a thousand, employing more than 4,000 workers, nearly eight times the 148 factories and 488 workers at the time of liberation. Iron factories are now able to manufacture relatively complex lathes and 24-spindle spinning machines. Currently, Xiu Feng, a model technician at the private Minsheng Iron Factory, is drawing blueprints for a human-powered tractor, preparing for mass production to meet the needs of the large-scale agricultural production movement that is about to be launched. The fur industry, which was completely destroyed by the enemy, has recovered to 133 households (165 before the war). From January to September last year, the transaction volume reached 520,000 pieces of various skins and over 600,000 catties of wool, and 50,000 pieces of leather were produced, almost reaching the pre-war level of 600,000 pieces per year.
　　With the support and organization of the democratic government, citizens have now pooled funds to open nearly 40 cooperative factories and workshops. Nearly a thousand citizens have taken out loans of over 200 million yuan (Jichaopiao) from the bank to engage in small-scale production. Last summer, women throughout the city earned over 400,000 catties of rice making military socks. Guo Shenshi from Xuédào Road alone earned 1,048 catties of rice. After providing for her family of three for half a year, she still has more than 200 catties of rice left. "Labor production" has become an unparalleled honor, and the name of "outstanding female apprentice – Wang Guixin" is spreading everywhere. She is 19 years old this year. Her husband was an apprentice at the Yuhua Textile Factory. After he joined the army last September, she took over his position. In just four months, she was able to operate the loom and weave cloth. In the fifth month, she was already weaving an average of four bolts of cloth every three days. Wang Guixin wrote to her husband, reporting her production achievements, and thoughtfully sent him 20,000 yuan, encouraging him to "work hard to kill the enemy and strive to be a model" on the front lines. On November 26th last year, at a rally attended by over 10,000 people in the city to celebrate the victory of the People's Liberation Army's autumn offensive and to develop industrial production, Mayor Guo personally pinned a silver medal on her chest.
　　In addition, the unemployed shoe workers in the city also organized their own cooperative factory – the "Forward Shoe Factory" – to restore the shoe industry. This not only solved the livelihood problem of more than 500 shoe workers in the city, but also absorbed 627 households of citizens to paste paper pulp (for making shoe paper). On average, more than 600 women provide shoe sole stitching services to the factory every day. From June of the year before last to October of last year, the women had earned over 785,000 catties of rice for their labor. Calculated at a living expense of two catties of rice per person per day, this is enough to support over a thousand people for the whole year.

　　邢台市工商业一瞥
    田流
    在抗战前，邢台曾是河北南部最大的商业城市，为全国著名的皮毛市场之一，毛皮销售于东北东南各省，及欧西英法德等国，每年成交量在六十余万张。日寇占领时期，全市工商业由战前的一千二百七十户，降为九百三十四户，皮毛业在“军用”的名义下全部被摧毁，而洋广货则增至七百九十六户，其资金占全市资金百分之六十九，当时邢台完全变成了殖民地市场。
    解放后，在民主政府的领导与帮助下，邢台工商业有了巨大的发展，从解放起至四七年五月，一年多的时间，在邢台外货消费品已基本上肃清，代之而起的是各种工业、手工业及与农村密切联系着的山货药材、皮毛、麻店、铁货等行业，其资金已占到全部资金的百分之九十一。大小工厂作坊已发展到千余家，职工四千余人，比解放时的一百四十八家、四百八十八人，发展近八倍。铁工厂已能装造较复杂的车床及二十四锭子的纺纱机。现在私营民生铁工厂模范技师秀峰正绘制人力拖拉机图样，准备大量制造，以适应行将开展的大规模的农业生产运动。被敌人完全摧毁的皮毛业已经恢复到一百三十三户（战前一百六十五户），去年一月至九月成交各种皮五十二万张，毛六十余万斤，制革五万余张，几乎赶上战前每年成交六十万张的水平。
    在民主政府扶助与组织下，现在市民们集资开办的合作社工厂，作坊近四十个；有近千的市民在银行贷款二亿余万元（冀钞），进行着小本生产。去年夏天全市妇女作军袜挣米四十余万斤。学道路郭申氏一个人就挣米一千零四十八斤，除全家三口人半年生活外，现在还剩余二百多斤米。“劳动生产”已经成了无上的荣耀，“出色女学徒——王桂琴”的名字到处飞扬。她今年十九岁，丈夫是裕华纺织工厂的学徒，去年九月参军走后，她便接替了丈夫的岗位，仅四个月的时间，就能上机织布了，第五个月已经平均三天织四匹布。王桂琴写信给丈夫报告自己的生产成绩，还体贴周到的寄去了两万块钱，鼓励丈夫“在前方努力杀敌，争取模范”。去年十一月二十六日在全市万余人庆祝解放军秋季攻势胜利，发展工业生产的大会上，郭市长亲自把银奖章挂在她的胸前。
    另外，全市失业的鞋业工人也自己组织合作工厂——“前进鞋工厂”恢复鞋业，不但解决了全市五百多鞋业工人的生活问题，还吸收着六百二十七户市民抹浆子（打鞋纸），每天还平均有六百多妇女给工厂纳鞋底。从前年六月到去年十月，妇女们已挣手工米七十八万五千多斤，以每人一天二斤米生活费计算，足够千余人全年的生活。
