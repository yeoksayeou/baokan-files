Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 11th: Reports from various sources: As American imperialism's open conspiracies of aggression have suffered severe blows from the people of the world, it is now secretly strengthening its global espionage network for underground conspiracies. The US House of Representatives adopted a rule limiting debate on the 7th (i.e., debate limited to a maximum of one hour, and no amendments could be proposed except by the House Military Committee) and passed a bill granting greater powers to the so-called "Central Intelligence Agency" without any explanation, in order to strengthen the activities of the American world espionage network. This is another sinister scheme following the US's secret "X Anti-Communist Plan" last year.
    In addition, the US House of Representatives will also propose the following military aggression bills, including the establishment of a radar network or the American "Defense" Act; authorizing the establishment of a three-thousand-mile-long target range for testing "guided rockets"; and authorizing the creation of additional Under Secretary of Defense positions.

　　美帝加强间谍网进行世界阴谋活动
    【新华社陕北十一日电】各方讯：美国帝国主义在公开的侵略阴谋已遭受全世界人民严重打击的时候，现正秘密地加强其世界间谍网的地下阴谋。美国众院已于七日采用限制辩论规则（即辩论至多只有一小时，除了众院军事委员会外，不能提出任何修正案），未加任何解释，即行通过了给所谓“中央谍报局”以较大权利的法案，以加强美国世界间谍网的活动。这是继去年美国秘密的“Ｘ反共计划”后的又一阴险勾当。
    此外，美众院尚将提出下述军事侵略性质的法案，包括成立雷幕或美国“防卫”法案；授权建立三千哩长的靶子场，作为试验“导向火箭”之用的法案；授权增设国防部次长职位的法案。
