　　Daxing Yarn Factory in Recovery and Reconstruction
　　Production Level Exceeds Pre-Liberation
　　[Our News] The Daxing Yarn Factory in Shijiazhuang has achieved remarkable results in its recovery and reconstruction over the past year. When the city was first liberated, the factory had 11,872 spindles, 500 looms, 6 blanket machines, and all associated parts, which were still intact. However, from the second day of the city's liberation, it was subjected to continuous bombing by enemy aircraft, resulting in extremely heavy losses to warehouses, machinery, and factory buildings. Thanks to the unity and repairs of the workers under the leadership of the factory, it was able to start production on January 18th of last year. Initially, only 400 spindles were operating, but by the end of last year, the factory had 11,136 spindles in operation, 72 looms in the weaving factory, and 6 blanket machines in the blanket factory, with a total of 1,510 employees.
　　In terms of production efficiency: Before liberation, the factory had a total of 11,872 spindles, working in two shifts for 24 hours a day, spinning an average of 17.2 count yarn, with a total monthly yarn production of less than 700 bales (400 pounds per bale); currently, with 11,296 spindles actually operating, working in three shifts for 24 hours a day, spinning an average of 19.13 count yarn, the total monthly yarn production is 800 bales (400 pounds per bale). The production of "Shanlu" cloth is slightly better than before liberation, but slightly lower than in the past. Before liberation, each loom produced a maximum of only 36.4 yards per shift (12 hours), but now, with the same types of cloth being woven as before liberation, each loom in the weaving factory produces 48 yards per shift (10 hours). The average production of the whole factory is 42 yards.
　　In terms of production quality, "Shanlu" cloth is the highest, breaking the highest record since the establishment of the factory. The quality of fine yarn generally exceeds that before liberation, but it cannot be guaranteed consistently due to raw material issues. The quality of blankets has also improved compared to the past, but production is lower due to a shortage of materials.
　　In terms of production quantity, the factory averaged 6,250 spindles in operation from January to December last year, producing a total of 1.88 million pounds of various fine yarns. From February to December last year, the weaving factory, with 60 looms, produced a total of 30,000 bolts of "Shanlu" fine cloth and 2,000 bolts of gauze. From June to December, the blanket factory, with 4 machines, produced more than 14,800 blankets. From this year onwards, the monthly production capacity (based on existing equipment) is 300,000 pounds of fine yarn (three shifts), 4,000 bolts of "Shanlu" cloth (two shifts), and 3,000 military blankets (one shift).
　　The factory's recovery work is rapid. Thanks to the efforts of all employees, the achievements, according to the statistics of the Mechanical Department: In the past year, a total of more than 140,000 parts have been made. Due to the full utilization of the employees' high degree of creativity, all the destroyed parts have been researched and reproduced by the factory, and some substitutes have been created.

### 恢复与重建中的大兴纱厂　生产水平超过解放前

　　恢复与重建中的大兴纱厂
  　生产水平超过解放前
    【本报讯】石家庄市大兴纱厂在一年来恢复与重建中，已获显著成绩。该厂刚解放时，共有纱锭一万一千八百七十二枚，布机五百台，毯机六台以及全部附属零件，尚为完整无缺。自本市解放第二天起即遭敌机连续轰炸，仓库、机器、厂房损失奇重，由于该厂领导上团结了职工重修，遂于去年一月十八日开车。最初只开四百枚纱锭，至去年底止，该厂实开砂锭已达一万一千一百三十六枚，布厂开布机七十二台，毯厂开毯机六台，全体职工共一千五百一十人。
    在生产效率上：解放前该厂共有纱锭一万一千八百七十二枚，每日两班工作二十四小时，纺纱平均为一七·二支，每月共计产纱不足七百件（每件四百磅）；目前实开纱锭一万一千二百九十六枚，每日工作三班，二十四小时，纺纱平均为一九·一三支，每月共计产纱八百件（每件四百磅）。山鹿布稍胜解放前，但略低于从前。解放前每台每班（十二小时）最高仅产三十六·四码，现在布厂织布的种类与解放前相同，但每台每班（十小时）产量已达四十八码。全厂平均产量为四十二码。
    生产质量上以由鹿布为最高，打破建厂以来之最高纪录。细纱质量一般超过解放前，因原料关系故不能保证经常。毯子亦较前提高，但因欠料关系，产量较低。
    生产数量上，该厂由去年一月至十二月平均锭数六千二百五十枚，共产各种细纱一百八十八万磅。布厂由去年二月至十二月布机六十台共产山鹿细布三万匹，纱布二千匹。毯厂由六月至十二月四台共产毯子一万四千八百余条，自今年度起每月生产能力（按现有设备）纱厂能产细纱三十万榜（三班），山鹿布四千匹（两班）军毯三千条（一班）。
    工厂恢复工作是迅速的。由于全体职工的努力，其成绩据机械科的统计：一年来共作零件十四万余件，由于发挥了职工的高度创造性，故所被炸毁的，全由该厂研究翻制，并创造了一些代用品。
