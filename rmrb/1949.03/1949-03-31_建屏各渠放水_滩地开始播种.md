　　Releasing Water from Canals in Jianping
　　Sowing Begins on滩 (Tān) Land

　　[From This Newspaper] The Jianping Special District of Chahar Province is intensifying water conservancy construction. In January of this year, the district seized every opportunity to prepare materials and plan construction for various water conservancy projects. Work began in early February. Currently, in Zhuangbu灘 (Tān), Jianping County, over 120 fang (each fang being 25 cubic feet) of mountain rocks have been completed. In Donghuangni, 225 fang have been completed, and in Tonghong灘 (Tān), 60 fang. Various canals are now being dredged and repaired, including water dividers, leveling wood, sluice gates, drops, bridges, and ferries. The Gaofu Main Canal and Sanguanmiao Canal in Fuping have been restored. Larger canals like Lingzheng and Rongzhen have begun releasing water to irrigate fields. Jianping County has reclaimed 13 plots of wasteland, creating 1,541 mu of灘 (Tān) land, of which 648 mu have been sown with hyacinth beans. In addition, a 120-zhang stone embankment (averaging four chi in height and width) was built in Tongjiakou, creating 360 mu of灘 (Tān) land, and over 10 zhang of stone embankment was built in Nanzhuang's lower wasteland, creating 120 mu of灘 (Tān) land. Shuinian Village in Pingshan County reclaimed one plot of wasteland, creating 200 mu of灘 (Tān) land, preparing to plant rice. In order to consolidate and expand the achievements of canal building and river management, the Special District has surveyed 13 river management projects. Nan Village and Shihou in Fuping County, Chen Village and Zhai Tou in Lingshou County, and Hongzidian in Jianping County are currently under construction.
