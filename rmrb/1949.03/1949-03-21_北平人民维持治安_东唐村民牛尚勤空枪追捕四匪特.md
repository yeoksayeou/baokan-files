　　Beiping People Maintain Public Order
    Dongtang Villager Niu Shangqin Pursues Four Bandit Special Agents with an Empty Gun
    [Ping City News] On the evening of March 10th, in the southwest corner of Dongtang Village, where a certain company of the 421st Regiment was stationed, four thugs disguised as civilians were discovered, acting suspiciously and looking around. Coincidentally, Niu Shangqin, a resident of the village, was returning from the street when he noticed their suspicious behavior. He quickly ran back to report to the soldiers of the Sixth Squad of the People's Liberation Army who were staying at his home, and then grabbed a rifle and gave chase. After running outside the village, the four thugs desperately ran forward. He immediately pursued them, intending to shoot, but discovered that the gun was empty. If he went back to get bullets, he feared the bandits would get away. Therefore, he resolved to pursue them with the empty gun, shouting loudly. The bandits panicked and threw away a pistol. At this time, two soldiers also arrived, and the four bandit special agents were captured by the joint efforts of the army and the people.

　　北平人民维持治安
    东唐村民牛尚勤空枪追捕四匪特
    【平市讯】三月十日黄昏，在四二一团某连驻地之东唐村西南角，发现四个化装老百姓模样的歹徒，鬼鬼祟祟，四下了望。碰巧该村住户牛尚勤由街上回来，发现他们形迹可疑，便一面急忙跑回报告住在他家的六班解放军战士，一面自己拿起一支大枪就追。跑到村外，四个歹徒已拼命往前逃跑。他随即猛追上去，要开枪，却发现枪里没子弹。回去取吧，怕匪徒跑远了。于是他决心拿着空枪，追上去。并大声喊叫。匪徒惊惶失措，逐将一支手枪抛出。这时两名战士也赶到，四名匪特就这样作了军民的俘虏。
