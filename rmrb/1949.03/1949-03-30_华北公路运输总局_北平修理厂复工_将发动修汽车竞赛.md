    Beiping Repair Factory Resumes Work
    To Launch Automobile Repair Competition
    [This Newspaper's Report] The Beiping Repair Factory of the North China Highway Transportation Bureau has formally resumed work. The factory currently has thirty-three vehicles awaiting repair. Repair workers are divided into six groups, plus one group each for electricians, carpenters, lathe operators, blacksmiths, tin workers, painters, tire workers, fitters, sewing workers, and cylinder cleaning workers, totaling sixteen groups. A production competition will be launched, with the goal of completing the repair of the thirty-three vehicles within two weeks. Starting from March 14th, all workers spent a week dismantling twenty-seven irreparable vehicles to use as spare parts for future repairs. Last week, the entire factory was thoroughly cleaned and renovated. The machinery, such as "air jacks" and "air pumps," which had been neglected during the Kuomintang rule, were also cleaned and prepared for use after repair. The semi-stagnant state that had persisted for three years has disappeared. All employees held a resumption meeting at 9:00 AM on the 27th. Cao Chengzong, Director of the North China Highway Bureau, and Lu Yuguang, Director of the Transportation Department, attended and spoke. The workers unanimously expressed their determination to unite, develop the factory, strive to increase production, and support the front lines.
    In addition, the Automobile Maintenance Factory of the North China Highway Bureau Transportation Department (formerly part of the Beiping Office of the Pingjin Automobile Repair and Assembly Factory of the pseudo-Highway Bureau) also resumed work yesterday and began repairing vehicles.

    北平修理厂复工
    将发动修汽车竞赛
    【本报讯】华北公路运输总局北平修理厂已正式复工。厂内现有三十三辆待修的汽车，修理工人分成六组，再加上电工、木工、车床工、锻工、人金工、漆工、胎工、钳工、缝工、洗缸工等各一组，共十六个组，将以生产竞赛方式预定在两周内完成三十三辆车的修理工作。全体工人由三月十四日起，曾在一个礼拜内拆卸了二十七辆不能再修的汽车，作为今后开工修车的零件。上周内又将全厂重新整理一新，国民党统治时期一向没人注意的机械“汽顶”、“汽泵”也都擦抹干净，准备修好后使用。三年来始终不死不活的半停顿状态已不复存在。全体职工于二十七日上午九时举行复工大会，华北公路总局局长曹承宗、运输处长鲁渔光都到场讲话，工人一致表示要团结一致，发展工厂、努力增产、支援前线。
    又华北公路总局运输处汽车保养厂（原伪公路总局平津汽车修配总厂北平营业所之一部）也于昨日复工，开始修车。（仲）
