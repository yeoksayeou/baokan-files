　　Japanese Reactionaries, Following the Will of U.S. Imperialism
    Are Planning to Expand the Japanese Police
    (Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 27th) Tokyo Dispatch: The reactionary Japanese government, following the instructions of its American masters, is actively planning to expand the fascist police force. According to Japanese press reports on February 22nd, the Japanese Diet is launching a so-called "reorganization of police forces" movement to increase the number of police and increase appropriations for equipping the police. The Yomiuri Shimbun quoted prevailing opinions among Japanese ruling figures as saying: The number of Japanese police is currently 125,000, and it would not be difficult to increase it to 150,000. The Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department has planned to allocate 25 million yen this year to strengthen police equipment.
