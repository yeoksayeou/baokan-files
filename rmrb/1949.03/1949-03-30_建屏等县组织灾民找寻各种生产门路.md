[Chahar News] Jianping, Huolu, Jingxing, and Xingtang counties have extensively launched production for self-salvation, starting from various aspects and production forms to organize the masses to overcome the spring famine. In Xiahuangbi Village, the fourth district of Huolu, 100 bolts of cloth can be produced every day. Some women in Nanhaishan and other villages have gone to the Shijiazhuang Textile Factory to do "thread picking" work. Women in Zhang'anzhuang Village in the ninth district are sending manure to the fields, freeing up male labor to go out and work as stonemasons. In Hanzhuang Village in the eighth district, some people are grinding tofu to earn bran to eat. The Jianping County Promotion Agency has prepared 94,000 jin of grain for loans, which have now begun to be issued. County and district cadres have implemented a movement of "saving one tael of rice per person per day," and plan to organize the masses in districts one, two, three, and six, which are close to the main roads, to develop transportation as a sideline: carrying wooden boards to the west and coal to the east, which can generate an income of 22,000 jin of rice by summer. In Wufangling, Touquan and other villages in the eighth district of Jingxing, more than 1,000 people have been organized in mutual aid groups to crush stones at the station, earning four to five jin of millet per person per day. In Xingtang, Huolu, Jingxing, and Jianping, some villages' women are making shoe soles. For example, in Xingjiazhuang and other eight villages in the third district of Xingtang, 4,800 pairs have been made since November of the lunar calendar last year, earning 14,400 jin of rice, and there are plans to continue supporting their development. In addition to instructing all counties to pay close attention to the spring famine and organize the masses for production and self-salvation, the Special Commissioner's Office has allocated a portion of relief grain and the first half of the year's preferential treatment grain for military families to provide necessary resettlement for especially difficult families of revolutionary martyrs, military personnel, workers, and orphans.
