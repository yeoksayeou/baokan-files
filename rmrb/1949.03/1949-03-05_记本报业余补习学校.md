　　Record of this Newspaper's Spare-time Remedial School
    Zhao Feng
    In order to meet the needs of the situation, improve the theoretical and cultural level of the staff, improve work, and run the Party newspaper well, this newspaper officially established the agency's spare-time remedial school on December 1st of last year. Comrade Zhang Panshi, the president of the newspaper, personally served as the principal, and responsible comrades from various departments served as teachers. All staff members actively participated in the study, persevering until now and achieving results and preliminary experience.
    The entire school is divided into four branch schools, with a total of more than 300 students. The theoretical study section uses A Simple History of Social Development as the textbook, with self-study as the main method, supplemented by group discussions and reports. Currently, the section on capitalist society has been completed and urban policy is now being studied. The cultural study section is divided into three classes according to proficiency levels: advanced (equivalent to middle school), intermediate (equivalent to upper elementary school graduation), and beginner (equivalent to lower elementary school) (some have only advanced and beginner levels). Study subjects include Chinese language, arithmetic, history and geography, a simple history of social development, current events, and the workers' movement. Each branch school can select and specify subjects according to different work natures and student requirements.
    This study is an unprecedentedly universal, sustained, and intense study for the newspaper. The students' enthusiasm has remained high throughout. Some departments have adjusted their work and improved efficiency to squeeze out time for study. The vast majority of comrades are able to arrive on time and not leave early for class, listening attentively and patiently taking notes to prepare for extracurricular review. For example, many workers in the factory, after a day of intense work, not only arrive to class on time, but often study on their own until 11 or 12 o'clock at night before resting. Learning issues are being discussed in many places. Comrades have all felt the benefits of learning, and erroneous arguments such as "working is the same whether you study or not" and "learning that is useless" have been basically eliminated. In more than a month, many comrades who were previously illiterate or had very little literacy have learned fifty or sixty new characters, and many comrades have learned addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. In the personal learning summaries written by the students last month, they all described their learning gains and opinions in detail. One comrade from the factory, when talking about his gains from studying history, said: "In the past, when watching operas, I saw Li Zicheng and Hong Xiuquan and thought they were all rebels. After studying history, I realized that they were leaders leading the people in revolutionary uprisings." Another two comrades said: "After studying history, I understood how the feudal aristocracy oppressed and exploited the people in history, and how the people resisted them." More than 70% of the comrades stated in their opinions that "We should speak more slowly so we can take notes," and "Try to issue handouts so we can study on our own." Four or five comrades specifically suggested: "If团 [presumably meaning Communist Youth League - translator] meetings or other matters take up class time, they should be made up later." This all shows that everyone attaches great importance to and is interested in and has gained from learning. Generally, advanced and intermediate students have gained the following: Not only have they understood punctuation marks and can use them in a preliminary way, they also know the abbreviations of Chinese provinces, which mining areas are in the North China region, which great mountains and rivers are in the world, they have learned fractions or ratios, and they know the process of human evolution, that labor created man, etc. With the development of learning, the atmosphere in the entire newspaper has been refreshed. Messengers read newspapers whenever they have time, and some correspondents even carry books in their hands while playing games, asking people they meet: "What is this character pronounced? How do you explain it?" Everyone feels that they know too little and must work and study with peace of mind. With improved understanding, personal issues have been greatly reduced. At the same time, everyone not only demands that they study hard, but they can also actively and frankly offer opinions to leaders and teachers. Since the establishment of the school, everyone has had no experience, and the students have promptly pointed out shortcomings and come up with improvement methods. Once, when a teacher arrived too late due to some matter, the students could not continue to wait and frankly posted a criticism on the blackboard: "The students all arrived early, but the teacher did not come, so we had to go back. We hope the teacher will be responsible in the future." This had a great supervisory effect on the teachers. Learning is a key, it is an important tool for improving the ideological understanding of staff, overcoming various undesirable tendencies, and improving work. - This point has been fully proven in these two months.
    In early February, another test of theoretical study was conducted. This test was a review after studying the capitalist section. The test reflected that the comrades participating in the study of A Simple History of Social Development have generally initially clarified the development laws of capitalist society and new democratic society and the completely different relationship between urban and rural areas. The vast majority of comrades are approaching reality or combining it with reality. Some comrades can use the theoretical weapon of the laws of social development to analyze the relationship between cities and villages in capitalist society and new democratic society, and have a deep understanding and criticism of the "Linqing Incident," clarifying the great role of the state economy and the cooperative economy, especially the profound significance of the link and bridge function of supply and marketing cooperatives and consumer cooperatives. However, the shortcomings are that they are not good at grasping the characteristics from the development of society, distinguishing the points of difference, or they are not good at making theoretical analysis and criticism from practical problems (such as the "Linqing Incident"), but are limited to "discussing the matter on its own merits."
    Whether learning can be developed and sustained is closely related to whether the leadership has determination and the degree of importance attached to it. From the beginning, leading cadres at all levels first clarified ideologically the issue that "leading learning is the task of leaders," and criticized the incorrect perception that leading learning is an "extra burden." At the mobilization meeting, the president called on everyone to regard learning as equally important as work. He proposed that good or bad learning is one of the main projects for evaluating cadres, and it is also one of the preparations for using and promoting cadres. The leading comrades also collected theoretical learning questions and made a report once a week, explaining each social stage in the history of social development one by one, pointing out the key points, answering questions, and giving everyone great inspiration. Moreover, the ideological guidance of learning was strengthened through reports. The Party's general branch committee also called on Party members to actively study and play an exemplary backbone role. Teachers must have the spirit of "teaching tirelessly," must prepare in advance, and must not perfunctorily muddle through. It was also stipulated that checking and discussing learning should be an important part of the Party's small group meetings. Timely ideological guidance and high mass enthusiasm are the key to the development and persistence of this study. At the same time, this kind of leadership is a combination of administrative and branch, overcoming the past practice of only "branch guarantees."
    Learning should be lively and energetic. Therefore, on the one hand, we studied various courses step by step and established a relatively formal learning system, such as class times, leave system, classroom rules, etc.; on the other hand, we adopted a variety of methods, not only using classes, group discussions, general discussions, special reports, self-study and review, etc., but also especially emphasized the combination with work in editing departments, organizing answer questions, creating wall newspapers, and publishing good ones in the newspaper. In this way, firstly, the learning content was enriched, and secondly, work was directly assisted. The majority of teachers were selected to be competent, and they generally prepared in advance and understood and reflected afterwards. It is necessary to avoid randomly grabbing teachers, "substituting classes," "temporary cramming" before class, and being done with it after class. At the same time, appropriate tests should be carried out in order to check the students' learning progress.
    The current shortcomings are: (1) The organization of cultural classes is not sound enough, and the system is not strict enough. There are only teachers, class teachers, etc., but no teaching affairs conference has been organized to regularly review and study teaching methods, teaching content, etc. The phenomenon of individual students being absent from class without reason still exists. Because of a lack of planning, there is still blindness in the teaching aspect. (2) Both theoretical learning and cultural learning lack textbooks, relying only on teachers lecturing and students listening or collective reading, which affects students' self-study. (3) Because students have different jobs, different levels, and different interests, the requirements are different. For example, many people like Chinese language but dislike arithmetic, but there are also some comrades who are very interested in arithmetic. This problem has not been properly addressed so far.

　　记本报业余补习学校
    赵烽
    为了适应形势需要，提高工作人员理论文化水平，改进工作，办好党报，本报于去年十二月一日正式成立了机关业余补习学校。社长张磐石同志亲任校长，各部门负责同志担任教员，全社工作人员皆积极参加学习，一直坚持至今，并取得成绩与初步经验。
    全校共分四个分校，共学员三百余人。其中理论学习部份以社会发展简史为课本，自学为主，小组讨论及报告为辅。目前已学完资本主义社会部份。正学习城市政策。文化学习部份，按照程度高低分为高级（相当中等学校）、中级（相当高小毕业）、初级（相当初小）三种班次（有的只高、初两级）。学习课目有国文、算术、史地、社会发展简史、时事、职工运动等，各分校可根据不同工作性质及学员要求选择规定。
    这次学习，为报社前所未有的一次普遍、持久、紧张的学习。学员情绪始终高涨。有些部门都是调整工作，提高效率，挤出时间进行学习。上课时绝大部份同志能作到不迟到早退，专心听讲；而且耐心的作笔记准备课外温习。如工厂好些工人同志，白天紧张的工作一天，不但能按时到课，且时常晚上自修到十一、十二点才休息。许多场合都在谈论着学习问题。同志们都感到了学习的好处，“不学习也一样工作”及“学那个没用”等错误论调基本上已被肃清。在一个多月中，很多过去不识字或识字很少的同志学会了五、六十个生字，很多同志学会了加减乘除。学员们在上月所写的个人学习总结中，都很详细的述说了自己的学习收获和意见。工厂有一位同志在谈到他学习历史的收获时说：“过去在看戏中看到李自成、洪秀全，认为他们都是造反，学了历史才知道他们是领导人民闹革命的领袖。”另二个同志说：“学了历史，我了解了历史上的封建贵族是如何压迫和剥削人民，而人民又是如何反抗他们。”百分之七十以上的同志在所提意见中都提出“要讲慢些，我们好作笔记。”“设法发讲义，我们好自习。”有四、五个同志特别提出：“团开会或其他事情占去上课时间应以后补上。”这都说明大家对学习是十分重视和有兴趣有收获的。一般的高、中级学员都得到如下的收获：标点符号不但了解了并能初步使用，知道了中国各省的简称，华北区有那些矿区，世界上有那些大山大河，学会了分数或比例，知道了人类进化过程，劳动创造了人等。随着学习的开展，全社空气为之一新。勤务员一有时间就看报纸，有的通讯员在游戏时手里还带着书，见人就问：“这个字念什么？怎么讲？”大家都感到自己知道的太少，必须安心工作安心学习。认识提高了，私人问题的大为减少。同时大家不但要求自己努力学习，并能对领导上及教员积极的直率的提出意见。自学校成立以来，大家都没经验，学员们曾及时的指出缺点并想出改进办法。有一次教员因事去的太迟了，学员们不能继续等下去，便在黑板上直率的提出批评：“学生早都来了，教员不来，我们只好回去，希望教员以后要负责任。”这对教员起了很大监督作用。学习是一把钥匙，它是提高工作人员思想认识，克服各种不良倾向，改进工作的一个重要工具。——这一点，在这两个月来已得到充分证明了。
    二月初，又进行了一次理论学习的测验，这次测验是资本主义部份学习后的检阅。从测验中，反映了参加社会发展简史学习的同志们，一般是初步明确了资本主义社会与新民主主义社会的发展规律及城乡关系的迥然不同，并且绝大部份同志是接近了实际或结合着实际，一部份同志且能运用社会发展规律的理论武器，来分析资本主义社会与新民主主义社会中城市与乡村的关系，及对“临清事件”作了深刻的认识与批判，明确了国家经济与合作经济的重大作用，特别是供销合作社与消费合作社的纽带、桥梁作用的深刻意义。但缺点是尚不善于从社会的发展中抓取特点，明辨不同之点，或不善于从实际问题（如“临清事件”）作理论的分析批判，而局限于“就事论事”。
    学习的能否开展与坚持，是与领导上有无决心及重视程度密切相关的。从开始，各级领导干部首先从思想上明确了“领导学习是领导者的任务”这一问题，批判了认为领导学习是“额外负担”的不正确的认识。在动员会上，社长号召大家把学习看成与工作同等重要。提出学习好坏是鉴定干部的主要项目之一，也是使用与提拔干部的准备之一。领导同志并搜集理论学习的问题于每周作一次报告，将社会发展史中的各社会阶段逐一讲解，指出关键，解答问题，给大家以极大启发。并且通过报告加强了学习的思想指导。党的总支委员会亦号召党员积极学习，起模范骨干作用。当教员的要有“诲人不倦”的精神，要事先准备，不能敷衍搪塞。并规定检查讨论学习为党的小组会的一个重要内容。及时的思想指导与高涨的群众情绪，是此次学习的开展与坚持的关键。同时这种领导，是行政与支部相结合的，克服了过去那种光是“支部保证”的作法。
    学习应该是活泼的，有生气的。因而我们一方面按步就班的学习各种课程，建立了比较正规的学习制度，如上下课时间、请假制度、课堂守则等；另方面采用了多种多样的方式，不但使用了上课、小组讨论、大会讨论、专人报告、自学复习等方式，而且在编辑部门等还特别强调了与工作结合，组织解答问题，创办墙报，好的并在报上登载。这样，一来充实了学习内容，二来直接帮助了工作。大部教员是经过选择能以胜任的，他们一般都事先准备事后了解反映。一定要避免乱抓教员，“代理上课”，课前不准备“临时抱佛脚”，上课以后完事大吉等现象。同时适当地进行测验，以便检查学员学习情况。
    目前的缺点是：（一）文化班组织不够健全，制度不够严格。只有教员班主任等，没有组织一个教务会议，定期检讨研究教授方式教学内容等。个别学员无故旷课等现象仍然存在。因为缺乏计划性，授课方面仍有盲目性。（二）无论理论学习或文化学习都缺乏课本，只靠教员讲学生听或集体阅读，影响了学员的自修。（三）因为学员工作不同，程度不同，兴趣不同，故要求不一。如很多人喜欢国文，不喜欢算术，但也有一部分同志对算术很感兴趣，这一问题至今未能作适当处理。
