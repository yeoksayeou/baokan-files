　　Highways Connect Beiping with Various Parts of North China
    [By Our Correspondent] The highway transportation between Beiping and the entire liberated area of North China is becoming increasingly smooth. The former Eighth Transportation Division of the Highway Bureau of the puppet Ministry of Communications has been renamed the Beiping First Automobile Company, directly under the North China Highway Bureau, and is scheduled to officially open on the 25th of this month, handling passenger transport between Ping (Su) County and Ping Ba (County), as well as freight transport between Ping Bao, Ping Shi, Ping Zhang, Ping Jin, Ping Xi (Fengkou), Ping Cheng (De) and other places. Fifty complete long-distance buses will be supplied to the above routes. Another part of the damaged vehicles are being repaired. The company has decided to send two special vehicles today to set up stations in Su County and Ba County. The more than forty long-distance buses of the Beiping Business Office of the former Kuomintang Ministry of Communications Highway Bureau Pingjin Automobile Repair and Assembly Plant, after being taken over, have also been decided to be allocated to the Transportation Department of the North China Highway Bureau for use, and will also open long-distance bus services between Pingjin and Pingbao, Pingshi, and other places soon. After the liberation of Beiping, the business of various private long-distance bus lines in the city has become very developed, and the destinations are very extensive. To the east as far as Dezhou, Jinan, Yantai, and Longkou, to the south as far as Baoding, Shijiazhuang, and Handan, to the west as far as Yixian, and to the north as far as Su County, Sanhe, and Pinggu, buses are running smoothly.
