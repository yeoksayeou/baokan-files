Nankou Section Railway Workers
By Our Correspondent Li Yi

On the night of December 11th last year, when the Kuomintang bandits fled in a panic from Nankou to Peiping, they displayed their consistent bestiality in a most cruel manner. They filled the area around the three generators of the Nankou Railway Machinery Factory (which has over 1,300 employees and is second only to the Changxindian and Tangshan factories in scale and output) with piles of high explosives and a large number of giant landmines, attempting to have the People's Liberation Army, upon first entering the factory, detonate the mines and perish together with the generators. However, the bandits' conspiracy did not succeed. On the morning of the 12th, when the People's Liberation Army entered the factory to search for remnant bandits, the factory's employees immediately reported to the People's Liberation Army and, with the assistance of the PLA engineering corps, safely removed all the mines and explosives, restoring power supply that very evening.

On the third day after the liberation of Nankou, as most of the original heads of various units had fled to Peiping and Tianjin, the employees, with the help of our receiving personnel, quickly organized themselves, established a temporary transportation office and leadership organizations for each department of the machinery factory, resumed production, and began the heavy task of military transport.

From December 16th to February 28th, the Nankou Machinery Factory and the rolling stock inspection, works, and locomotive departments repaired 15 locomotives of various types, 54 passenger and freight cars, and 43 automobiles, manufactured over 4,400 various machine and vehicle parts, and forged 150,000 track spikes. They also rushed to produce a large number of siege equipment for the People's Liberation Army on the Peiping-Tianjin front.

When completing the massive task of producing track spikes, the biggest difficulty initially encountered was the slow production of semi-finished products by the forging department. In order to conserve formed raw materials, the employees had to use a large amount of scrap iron, which varied in size. To forge these into track spikes that met specifications, it was necessary to melt them down and forge them into uniform shapes. Therefore, in the first few days of track spike production, the semi-finished products forged by the 60-plus workers in the forging department often could not meet the needs of the 100-plus workers completing the products. In such a situation, a fierce competition naturally developed between the semi-finished product workers and the finished product workers.

The workers in the forging department, in order to meet the increasing needs of the finished product workers, broke the previous convention of only one person working under a steam or electric hammer, and learned to have three or even four people working under one hammer simultaneously, increasing production from 4,926 pieces on January 25th to 7,482 pieces on February 1st, and then to 10,147 pieces by February 12th.

The workers producing finished products, under the slogan of "Complete as much as is delivered (referring to semi-finished products)," also increased production from 4,926 pieces on January 25th to 10,604 pieces on February 12th. In short, the production of track spikes increased linearly. When production reached its peak on February 12th, it had increased by 280 percent compared to the first day (January 25th). In this way, the workers of the Nankou Machinery Factory, rolling stock inspection section, locomotive section, and works section completed the massive production plan of 150,000 track spikes one day ahead of schedule on February 14th. Under the rule of the Kuomintang bandits, this would have taken at least a month.

More than a hundred workers in the factory's construction department also spontaneously organized themselves, and in addition to completing their daily tasks, carried out voluntary processing. The five-pan furnace initially produced 300 track spikes per day, and finally over 1,000 per day. They said, "If we don't perform meritorious service at this time, when will we?"

Riveting workshop workers Han Shuyan and Ren Shuqing modified a wind power compressor into a "ratezi" (a tool) for driving track spikes, using square iron plates cut from seven-fen yuan iron, producing about 500 track spikes per day, increasing productivity by three or four times compared to the average person. Li Changqing, a worker at furnace No. 7 in the re-manufacturing workshop, after several days of careful research, increased the number of iron pieces burned per furnace from ten to sixty, and production also increased from an initial 90 pieces per day to over 450 pieces.

Another astonishing feat of the Nankou section employees was the creation of a record of 46 trains running in 24 hours on the 30-kilometer special driving section between Nankou and Kangzhuang during the large-scale military transport that began on December 26th of last year. The altitude of Kangzhuang, Qinglongqiao in the 30-kilometer section of the Ping-Sui Railway from Nankou to Kangzhuang is more than 400 meters higher than Nankou. Before and after the Juyongguan Station, the maximum slope reaches 33 per thousand meters, and the minimum turning radius is 213.4 meters. In general railway engineering, the slope generally cannot exceed 8 per thousand meters, and the turning diameter generally cannot be less than 250 meters. This mountainous section passes through six tunnels totaling about 4,000 meters, and each station only has two tracks (because both sides are towering mountains, and it is very difficult to open up a new track). Only two trains can pass each other on the same station. During the rule of the Japanese invaders and the Kuomintang bandits, the maximum number of trains per day did not exceed 30.

Secondly, there were man-made difficulties. When the Kuomintang bandits withdrew from the Nankou section to Peiping, they took away most of the supervisors and some drivers and technicians from the section and each station, and destroyed the block machines and signal equipment at each station. Driver Liu Chunxuan said to me, "At that time, there was only one temporary telephone line between the stations, which was used for both dispatching and general communication. Because there was no block machine, when a train arrived at a station, it had to call the station above to ask if there was a train coming over. If the phone broke down or was not heard clearly, there would be a risk of a train collision."

Thirdly, there was a shortage of locomotives and driver and stoker personnel. During the peak of military transport, the Nankou locomotive section had only 13 locomotives. The Nankou locomotive section only had enough locomotive personnel for 17 shifts. According to the 46 trains running in 24 hours at that time, the Nankou locomotive section was short of six shifts, in addition to the six shifts undertaken by Kangzhuang Station.

In order to complete the military transport by 100%, the heroic employees mobilized all the workers who used to work as drivers and stokers on the station. If there were not enough locomotives, they used the method of "workers rest, but cars don't rest," which reduced the take over time of each locomotive to 40-50 minutes. In the past, according to the old rules of the railway for decades, the take over time for shifts had to be at least 1.5 hours. Another method was to change the old practice of two locomotives going to Kangzhuang together and then returning to Nankou. One of the locomotives would drive back when the slope decreased after the train passed Xikou, two kilometers west of Qinglongqiao, leaving the remaining locomotive to pull to Kangzhuang alone. In this way, they had enough locomotives for both up and down driving.

During the most intense days of military transport, the drivers and stokers had only two or three hours of rest per day. Their eyes were bloodshot, and even the time for washing their faces and urinating seemed particularly precious.

It was with such tenacious spirit that the railway employees of the Nankou section created the unprecedented glorious achievement in the history of the Ping-Sui Railway, earning them two commendations from the Ping-Sui Railway Bureau.

　　南口段的铁路员工
    本报记者  李翼
    去年十二月十一日夜，国民党匪帮自南口狼狈窜往北平时，极其惨忍的发挥了他们一贯的兽性，在南口铁路机厂（按该厂拥有职工一千三百余名，规模及产量仅稍次于长辛店、唐山两机厂）发电所三具发电机的周围，布满了成堆的烈性炸药和大批巨型地雷，企图使首次进入该所的解放军踏响了地雷之后，与发电机同归于尽。可是匪帮们的阴谋并没得逞。十二日晨，当解放军进入该厂搜寻残匪时，该厂员工便立刻报告给解放军，并在解放军工兵部队的协助下，立刻将地雷、炸药一一安全起出，当晚即恢复送电。
    在南口解放后的第三天，由于原各单位负责人大都逃往平津，员工们便在我接收人员帮助下，迅速的组织起来，成立了临时运输处，和机厂的各所领导机构，恢复了生产，开始了繁重的军运。
    从十二月十六日至二月二十八日，南口机厂及检车、工务、机务等股，修理好各式机车十五辆，客货车五十四辆，汽车四十三辆，配制各种机器、车辆零件四千四百余件，打道钉十五万。并为平津前线人民解放军赶制了大批的攻坚器材。
    在完成庞大的道钉生产任务时，开始所遇到的最大困难，是锻工部半成品生产太慢，员工们为了节用成型的原料，必须大量使用废铁，而这种废铁大小不一，要想打成合乎规格的道钉，就必须把它熔化，打成同型的东西。所以，在开始进行道钉生产的几天，锻工所六十余位工人所熔打的半成品，往往供不上一百余完成工的需要。在这样的情况下，半成品和完成品的工人间，自然形成一种炽热的竞赛。
    锻工部制作半成品的工人们为着满足完成品工人们日益加多的需要，打破了以往在一部汽锤或电锤铁柄下只能一人作业的常规，学会了三个甚至四个人同时在一具铁柄下作业，使产品由一月二十五日的四千九百二十六节增至二月一日的七千四百八十二节，至二月十二日，则增至一万零一百四十七节。
    完成品的工人们在“送来多少（指半成品）完成多少”的口号下，亦由一月二十五日的四千九百二十六节增至二月十二日的一万零六百零四节。总之，道钉的生产量是直线上升的。二月十二日生产达最高潮时，较诸第一天（一月二十五日）的生产量，提高到百分之二百八十，就这样，南口机厂和检车段、机务段、工务段的工人们于二月十四日，提前一天完成了十五万道钉的庞大生产计划。而在国民党匪帮统治时期，至少需要一个多月。
    机厂建立所的一百多个工人，也自动组织起来，除了按日完成自己的业务外，实行义务加工，五盘炉开始时日出道钉三百个，最后日出一千余个。他们说：“这时候不立功，什么时候才立功呢？”
    铆工所的工人韩树岩、任树清，将风力缩机改为打道钉的“率子”，使用七分元铁剪下来的方铁板，每日能出道钉五百个左右，较一般人生产率提高了三、四倍。再制品所七号炉工人李长清，经过几天的细心研究，由每炉一次烧十节铁增烧到六十节后，产品也由最初的每日九十个增至四百五十余个。
    南口段员工们另一件惊人事迹，就是他们在去年十二月二十六日开始的月余大规模军运中，在南口、康庄段三十公里的特别行车区间，创造了二十四小时行车四十六列的纪录。平绥路南口至康庄这三十公里的地段、康庄，青龙桥的拔海高度较南口竟高出四百余公尺。在居庸关车站前后，最高坡度达千分之三点三公尺，最小弯度半径为二百一十三点四公尺，而就铁路一般工程来说，坡度一般不能超过千分之点八公尺，弯度直径一般不能小于二百五十公尺。这段山间，前后要通过六道共约四千余公尺的山洞，以及各站只有两股道（因两旁均为崇山峻岭，要想增辟一条路轨，就必须开山，这是很不容易的事情），在同一车站上，仅能有两列车相错分行，日寇及国民党匪帮统治时期，每日行车最多不超过三十列。
    其次是人为的困难。当国民党匪帮从南口段撤往北平时，带走了该段及各站大部主管人员，及一部份司机和技术人员，并破坏了各站的闭塞机和号志设备，司机刘春萱对我说：“当时各站之间只有一条临时架起来的电话线，调度是它，普通联络也是它。由于没有闭塞机，列车到了一站，就得先打电话到上站，问问有没有车要过来。倘若电话一坏，或没有听清楚，就会有撞车的危险。
    再次是机车和司机、司炉人员缺乏。军运紧张时，南口机务段只有十三辆机车。南口机务段仅够十七班的机车人员，按照当时二十四小时行车四十六列的次数，除由康庄车站担任六班外，南口机务段尚缺六班。
    英勇的员工们为了百分之百的完成当时的军运，就将原在站上做内勤而以前做过司机、司炉的工人，全部动员了出来。机车不够用，他们就用“工人歇、车不歇”的办法，使每个机车上下接替的时间减少到四、五十分钟。而在以前，几十年来铁路上的老规矩，上下班的接替时间，最少也得一点半钟。另外一个办法，就是改变了以往两个机车同到康庄再返回南口的老例，以其中一个机车，在列车过青龙桥西二公里西口后坡度减低时，即驶回，让余下的一个机车单独拉到康庄。这样，他们使上下行驶有了足够的机车。
    在军运最紧张的几天，司机和司炉的工友们，每日的休息时间，有的只有两三个小时。他们的眼睛熬得通红，连洗脸和小便的时间，都显得特别宝贵。
    南口段的铁路员工们，就是以这样的坚韧精神，创造了平绥线史无前例的光荣事迹，博得了平绥铁路局两次通令表扬。
