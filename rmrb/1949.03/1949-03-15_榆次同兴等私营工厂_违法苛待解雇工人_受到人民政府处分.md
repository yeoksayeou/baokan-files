[Jinzhong Electricity] The Yuci Tongxing, Jianhua, Xiacheng and other private factories did not implement labor-capital agreements and arbitrarily dismissed seven workers, arousing public anger among the workers. Guo Shiying, a worker at the Jianhua factory, kindly provided suggestions to the factory for improving production, but the shopkeeper not only did not accept them, but also fired Guo Shiying. The Xiacheng factory used disguised methods to dismiss workers: for example, worker Yan Youcheng asked the capitalist to write a certificate for his village, proving that he worked in the factory to avoid shouldering the burden of the war effort in the village. The capitalist used this as an excuse to force Yan Youcheng to return to the village. The Zhenxing factory did not provide heating in the workshop during the winter, and in order to have workers weave thirty yards of cloth by 3 o'clock, fabricated a "government order" stating: "If it is not done well or not enough, there will be no leniency." The treatment of female workers was even harsher: for example, the agreement stipulated that "February 7th" workers would have a day off, but the factory only gave it to male workers, not female workers. The above illegal acts aroused dissatisfaction among the city's workers, who unanimously demanded that the government handle it. To this end, the Municipal Government, the Municipal Committee, the Trade Union, and the Federation of Industry and Commerce jointly convened a meeting of worker representatives and the capitalists of the aforementioned factories to handle the matter in accordance with the law: 1. The capitalists of the four factories apologized to the workers and admitted their mistakes. 2. The dismissed workers who have not yet found employment will be reinstated quickly. 3. The wages will be retroactively paid to the female workers who were not given the "February 7th" holiday. In addition to criticizing the above illegal acts of the capitalists in the city's blackboards, the Municipal Government also gave warnings and other punishments.

　　榆次同兴等私营工厂
    违法苛待解雇工人  受到人民政府处分
    【晋中电】榆次同兴、建华、协成等私人工厂，不执行劳资协议，随便解雇工人七人，激起工人公愤。建华工厂工人郭士英善意的向厂方提供改进生产意见，掌柜不但不接受，反而开除了郭士英。协成工厂用变象的办法解雇工人：如工人阎友诚请资方给他村写个证明，证明他在工厂作工，以免在村里负担远征战勤，资方即借此逼迫阎友诚回村。振兴工厂冬天工房不生火，并为了要工人三点钟织成三十码布，伪造“政府命令”，说：“如若做不好，做不够，决不宽贷。”对女工更加苛刻：如协议中规定“二七”工人放假一天，但该厂只放男工，女工不放。以上违法行为，引起全市工人不满，一致要求政府处理。为此，市政府、市委会、职工会、工商联合会，特召开了工人代表及上述工厂资方会议，依法处理：一、四厂资方向工人道歉承认错误。二、所解雇的工人，现未找下职业者，迅速复工。三、“二七”未放女工的假，给补发工资。对资方以上违法行为，除在本市各黑板报上批评外，市政府并给予警告等处分。
