　　US Imperialism Uses Low-Interest Loans
  　Incites Indian Government to Arrest Democrats
    Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 4th. The Indian government's large-scale arrest of communists and democrats was carried out under the direct pressure of American financial groups. According to a United Press dispatch from Moscow on February 27th, *Pravda* published a TASS dispatch from New Delhi stating: The delegation from the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development, currently in the Indian capital, has suggested granting India loans with interest rates as high as 4.5%. The delegation told the Indian government: Due to the "threat" of communism, the interest rate is high; if this "threat" can be eliminated, the interest rate can be reduced. TASS stated: 2,600 democrats have been arrested in various industrial centers of India and in the Hyderabad Federation. Currently, anyone who expresses any sympathy for those arrested or criticizes the government's arrests is enough to be accused of the "crime" of communism and thus suffer repression.

　　美帝利用低利贷款
  　唆使印政府逮捕民主人士
    【新华社陕北四日电】印度政府此次大事逮捕共产党人与民主人士，是在美国金融集团直接压力下施行的。据合众社莫斯科二月二十七日电，真理报发表塔斯社新德里电讯称：刻在印度首都的国际建设及开发银行代表团，已向印度建议给以利率高达百分之四点五的贷款。代表团对印政府说：由于共产党的“威胁”，所以利率是高的，如果能消除这一“威胁”，利率就能减低。塔斯社称：印度各工业中心及海德拉联邦内已有民主人士二千六百名被捕。目前，凡有人对被捕者表示任何同情或对政府逮捕事件加以任何批评，都足以使他被控以共产主义“罪名”，并因而遭受镇压。
