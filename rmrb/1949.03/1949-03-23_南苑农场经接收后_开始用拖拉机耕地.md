　　【Ping City News】Nanyuan Farm is located south of Ping City, with nearly ten thousand mu of flat land (including the abandoned airfield). Originally, it was the private property of Zhang Zongchang, a warlord of the Northern Warlords. After the "July 7th" Incident, it was operated by the Japanese Sanyou Company. After the surrender of the Japanese, it was taken over by Chiang Kai-shek's bandit troops, who only cultivated a little over five qing of land, and the rest of the land was already barren. After the Military Control Commission took over the farm, it decided to transfer ten tractors from the Tianjin-received Kenye Farm to cultivate the land, and more than a thousand mu have now been cultivated. In response to the farmers' requests, the farm has now begun to study various specific measures to organize farmers (especially poor farmers) to operate jointly.

　　南苑农场经接收后
    开始用拖拉机耕地
    【平市讯】南苑农场位于平市城南，有平地近万亩（包括废飞机场在内）。原为北洋军阀张宗昌的私产，“七七”事变后为日寇三友社经营，日寇投降，被蒋匪军接收，只耕了五顷多地，其余的地业已荒芜。军管会接收该农场后，乃决定把天津接收垦业农场的十架拖拉机调来耕地，现已耕千余亩。在农民纷纷要求下，该农场现已开始研究把农民（特别是贫苦农民）组织起来合伙经营的各项具体办法。
