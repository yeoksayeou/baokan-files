Zhongshan Park Sapper Get-Together

[Our Newspaper] In order to strengthen ties with the workers of this city, the 121st Division of the 41st Army of the Northeast Field Army held a get-together with workers from the 70th Ordnance Factory, the Sixth Ordnance Repair Factory, and other factories at the Zhongshan Park Music Hall on the evening of the 14th. The 70th Ordnance Factory and the Sixth Ordnance Repair Factory have already made a "Worker-Peasant Iron Flow" banner, which they plan to present to the comrades of the 121st Division of the 41st Army at the meeting. They also wrote many warm letters of appreciation. Fan Zhiquan, from the Inspection Section, wrote in his letter: "Comrades of the 121st Division: You quickly liberated Beiping. Your hard work is immense; you have put in great effort and expended much energy. We workers salute the entire division! We will further expedite the production of weapons to be sent to the front lines to quickly overthrow the reactionaries and liberate all of China."

    十四日晚上在中山公园音乐堂和七十兵工厂第六修械所等工厂的工人们开联欢会。七十兵工厂和第六修械厂已经制好了“工农铁流”锦旗一面，预备在大会上赠给四十一军一百二十一师的同志们，他们还写了不少热烈的慰问信。检验课的范之权在信里写着：“一二一师同志们：你们很快的把北平解放了，你们的辛苦是很大的，费了很大的力气，费了很多的心血，我们工人向贵师全体致敬！我们更要赶制武器，送到前线，把那反动派快快打倒了，解放全中国。”
