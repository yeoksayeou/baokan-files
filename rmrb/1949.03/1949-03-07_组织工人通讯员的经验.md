Experiences in Organizing Worker Correspondents
    Our Newspaper's Correspondent Liaison Section

    To strengthen the connection between the Party newspaper and the workers, our newspaper conducted a trial run of worker correspondent network in Shijiazhuang City. After more than 40 days of exploration, we developed a total of 104 worker correspondents, a portion of whom have been organized into correspondent groups, and they continuously send various manuscripts to our newspaper. After this period of exploration, we have the following experiences to share for reference:

    (1) Organizing worker correspondent work should be seen as one of the worker movement's tasks, a rather arduous mass work. It requires going deep among the workers, listening to their opinions, and educating and enlightening worker comrades. It cannot be solved by a single correspondent registration form or a correspondent appointment letter. When we first went to the Coking Plant, we first went to the workers to understand their situation and explain our intentions. We pledged to help the workers with any requests or needs they had. For example, if they needed someone to record their meetings, we would help them record. If we found problems that could not be solved, we would help explain and educate. As time went on and our relationship with the workers became familiar, they would offer opinions on correspondence work. For example, a worker in one department of the plant expressed an opinion about the previously elected correspondents, saying, "A correspondent only has two eyes; how much can they see?" This clearly shows that some workers had opinions about past reports. Previously, the plant had elected one correspondent from each shift to be responsible for recording model worker deeds and sending manuscripts to the plant's newsletter, which of course would not provide comprehensive reporting. Especially in Department One, when awarding prizes, the correspondent would hold a list of model workers and say that these were the people they usually saw, but the workers thought, "You saw some people, but why didn't you see others?" Also, "You saw the good things about some people, but why didn't you record the bad things?" Based on this situation, we explained in detail what a correspondent is, that a correspondent is not just one person but the more the better. Establishing a correspondent network means facilitating communication between the lower and upper levels, as well as between different places. It's not just about saying good things and not bad things; we should say both good and bad, explaining that doing so is for the sake of improving our factory, and everyone has this responsibility and right. This clarified the understanding of correspondence work. When going deep among the workers, we also universally read the "Explanation of Several Issues" in the Labor University Resolution and other documents. This was a common request from the workers. During the document reading, each issue would spark a discussion. For example, when reading about wages, the workers would relate it to the plant's wages. When discussing worker welfare issues, they also enthusiastically debated the problems with the employee cooperative itself. Finally, they asked if these opinions could be written to the newspaper, and we affirmed, "These can all be written as opinions and sent to the newspaper." This increased the workers' enthusiasm for writing and generated manuscripts.

    (2) To ensure that worker correspondence work achieves results, it is necessary to maintain close contact with the leadership. In Shijiazhuang, we received a lot of help because of our good relationship with the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions. Comrade Li Zhen of the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions told us about the characteristics of the workers and how to approach them. She said, "Approaching the workers requires enthusiasm, truly coming to serve the workers. Secondly, if you don't know something, say you don't know; don't pretend to know, because the workers won't trust you. You need to know that once the workers trust you, they will do everything possible to help your work..." This was indeed the case, and these words helped us a lot in our work. At the same time, we also relied on the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions to help introduce many worker comrades and materials, and helped convene the first worker correspondent symposium. Moreover, most of the worker correspondents introduced by the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions played a role.

    (3) Should we develop universally or focus on key individuals? We adopted two methods. One was for factories where we didn't have enough manpower, we focused on developing individual workers and then let these key individuals slowly develop others. The other was to go deep into a factory and develop universally, as we did in the Coking Plant. After going deep to understand the workers, we convened a symposium for the key individuals we had identified and some comrades introduced by the trade union. This symposium was completely voluntary, and the participating employees were in high spirits. At the meeting, heated discussions were held on "What to write," "How to write," and organizational issues. It was decided that each production unit would form a correspondent group, and a central group composed of comrades Dong Ruilin and Secretary Lu Ling from the trade union would be responsible for leading the reporting work and reviewing necessary manuscripts. The meeting also proposed the study of the Labor University Resolution and other employee movement documents, as well as the article "Mass Supervision of Worker Correspondents" (Krupskaya). The factory was also responsible for reprinting the latter document and distributing it to every worker correspondent for study. This universally organized the entire plant. In factories where manpower was insufficient, we focused on key development, not necessarily requiring a large number, as long as they could play a role. For example, in enterprises such as the Electric Light Company and the Telephone Bureau, there were not many worker correspondents, but they all played a role. The congratulatory telegram to the workers in Pingjin and other places was organized by these comrades. Comrades Zhao Ping and two other correspondents from the Electric Light Company reported the workers' activities in the Electric Light Company in a timely manner. In January, Comrade Zhao Ping wrote three articles, all of which were used in the newspaper.

    (4) After the worker correspondents are organized, the issue becomes cultivation and education. In addition to providing basic knowledge of journalism in daily conversations, the main thing is to provide concrete help and organize them to collectively study writing. Before the Coking Plant's correspondent group was established, we specifically helped them write manuscripts. We also asked them to write about the materials we understood and discussed and studied with them repeatedly (such as with Comrades Zhao Ji, etc.). This invisibly improved their writing skills. After the correspondent group was established, a meeting system was established. In the meetings, each correspondent would first report materials, then study reporting issues, and finally divide the work to write. For example, the New Year's reports and writing condolence letters were all divided after discussion.

    (5) What to report and ghostwriting for workers all require good help for the worker correspondents to solve. In addition to the main points mentioned in the usual talks and symposiums, we also need to tell them in real life what to report. For example, once on the furnace platform, I saw a worker repairing a broken broom. According to him, "This broom has been repaired five times. In the past (under enemy and puppet rule), let alone repairing it, we would even destroy it!" So I seized on this broom story and told the correspondent to write about it. Some worker correspondents are very active but illiterate, so ghostwriting is a big problem. Yu Qinghe, a worker in the Coking Plant, is illiterate, but since becoming a newspaper correspondent, he has been inquiring about materials everywhere and writing condolence letters to the workers in Tangshan, showing great enthusiasm and playing a significant role. But because he is illiterate, he cannot write himself, so some materials have been put aside. In the Coking Plant, we asked literate comrades to help illiterate comrades more, proposing that "Ghostwriting for workers is the most glorious thing and is also a concrete way to serve the working class." This has achieved some results.

　　组织工人通讯员的经验
    本报通联科
    为了加强党报与工人的联系，本报在石家庄市曾试行开展工人通讯网的工作，经过四十余天的摸索，共发展了一百零四个工人通讯员，其中一部份已组织成通讯小组，且不断的寄给本报各种稿件。经过这一时期摸索，有以下几点经验，提出以供参考：
    （一）组织工人通讯工作，应看做是工人运动工作之一，是相当艰苦的群众工作，必须深入到工人中去，听取工人意见，教育与启发工人同志，绝不是一张通讯员登记表或给他一个通讯员聘书所能解决问题的。我们开始到炼焦厂的时候，就是首先到工人中去进行了解，说明来意，工人有什么要求，需要我们帮助的，一定帮助他解决。例如他们开会需要记录，我们就帮助记录，发现问题不能解决，我们也帮助进行解释教育，这样日深月久，与工人的关系熟了，他们就会提出通讯工作的意见。如该厂一部一个工人对过去选举的通讯员就提出意见说：“一个通讯员才两个眼睛，他能看到哪一点？”这很明显，有些工人对过去报导有意见。原来该厂工人中过去每班选举一通讯员，光负责记工人模范事迹，给该厂快报寄稿，当然不会报导全面了，特别是一部在评奖时，通讯员拿着个模范名单，并说这是自己平常看到的，但工人认为：“有的人你看到了，为什么有些人你就看不到呢？”还有，“有的人好处你就看到了，不好的你怎么就不记呢？一根椐这样情况，就向他们详细解释什么叫通讯员，通讯员不是一个而是愈多愈好，建立通讯网，就是要下边和上边以及各地方相互通气，也不是光说好的不说坏的，应该是好坏都说，并说明这样做是为的把我们的工厂做好，大家都有这个责任和权利。使大家对通讯工作有了明确认识，在深入工人中，还普遍的读了劳大决议案中关于几个问题的说明等文件，这是工人普遍的要求，在读文件中，每读一个问题，就必引起一场讨论，如读工资时，工人就联系本厂工资扯起来了，谈到工人福利问题时，他们也热烈地对职工合作社本身问题展开了讨论。最后，他们提出这些意见可以不可以写给报社里，我们肯定的答复他们：“这些都可以写成意见寄给报社。”这样提高了工人写作热情，又组织了稿件。
    （二）为了使工人通讯工作做出成绩来，必须和领导上取得密切联系。我们在石家庄由于与市总工会联系得好，得到了很多帮助。市总工会李贞同志告诉我们工人的特点，及如何接近工人的问题，他说：“接近工人必须有热情，真正的是为工人服务而来，其次是不知道就说不知道，不要不知道装作知道，这样工人是不会信任你的，要知道工人信任了你以后，是会想尽办法来帮助你的工作的……。”真是这样，这些话使我们工作中得到很大帮助。同时，还依靠市工会帮助介绍了不少的工人同志和材料，帮助召开了第一次工人通讯员座谈会。并且经市总工会介绍的这批工人通讯员，大多数是发挥了作用的。
    （三）普遍发展，还是有重点的发展？我们采取了两种办法，一种是力量顾不过来的工厂，就着重个别发展，然后再由这些骨干慢慢的去发展，另一种是深入一个工厂普遍的发展，如在炼焦厂里就是采取普遍发展的。当经过深入工人了解以后，就召集平时发现的骨干分子及工会介绍的一些同志举行座谈会，这个座谈会完全是自由参加的，参加这个会议的职工同志，情绪很高。会上对“写什么”，“怎样写”及通讯组织问题都进行了热烈的讨论，决定每个生产单位都组成一个通讯小组，并由工会董瑞麟、秘书卢凌等同志组成一个中心组，负责领导报导工作及审查必要的稿件，会上并提出通讯员的学习，决定学习劳大决议等职工运动的文件及“群众监督工人通讯员”一文（克鲁普斯卡娅），后一文件工厂还负责翻印，分发给每一个工人通讯员进行学习，这样把全厂都普遍组织起来了，在力量达不到的工厂，就有重点的进行发展，不一定要求多，只要能起到作用就行。如电灯公司、电话局等企业中，工人通讯员并不多，但都很起作用，这次给平津等地工人的贺电，就是这些同志组织的。电灯公司赵萍等三个通讯员同志，将电灯公司的工人活动及时的进行了报导，一月份赵萍同志写了三篇稿子，报纸上都用了。
    （四）工人通讯员组织起来以后，就是培养与教育的问题。除去日常在谈话中，进行新闻基本知识的教育外，主要的是具体帮助和组织他们自己集体研究写稿。炼焦厂通讯小组未成立以前，我们就具体帮助他们写稿，了解的材料也找他们去写，和他们一块反复讨论研究（如对兆基等同志），这样无形中提高了他们的写作技术，从通讯小组建立以后，会议制度就建立起来了。在会议中各个通讯员同志先汇报材料，然后研究报导问题，最后分工去写。如新年的报导，写慰问信等，都是经过讨论以后才分工去写的。
    （五）报导什么与给工人代笔等，这都需要很好的帮助工人通讯员解决。报导什么，除在平时和座谈会上讲的那些要点以外，还要在实际生活中去告诉他们。如有一次在炉台上，看到一个工人修理一把破扫帚，据他谈：“这把扫帚已经修理了五次之多，在过去（敌伪统治时）不要说修理，还要破坏哩！”于是就抓住这个扫帚的故事告诉通讯员来写。工人通讯员中，有些很积极但是不识字，所以代笔就是一个大问题，炼焦厂工人于庆合，他不认识字，自从成了报纸通讯员以后，到处打听材料给唐山工人写慰问信等，表现非常积极，起了不小作用。但因为不识字，自己不能写，就将一些材料搁下了。我们在炼焦厂就要求有文化的同志多帮助不识字的同志，提出：“给工人代笔是最光荣的事情，也是具体的为工人阶级服务。”曾获得一些成绩。
