Xinhua News Agency, Central Plains, 3rd. Xuchang City has victoriously completed its winter business tax collection. The city is a commercial hub in the southern section of the Pinghan Railway, and its industry and commerce have been severely ravaged by the Kuomintang bandits. In the early days of liberation, the People's Government, in order to quickly restore its industry and commerce, issued an order exempting it from the autumn business tax burden. This first collection of winter business tax is based on the principle of separating industry from commerce and ensuring a reasonable burden. It involved self-reporting and public discussion, unfolding democratic evaluation, exposing tax-evading merchants and those attempting to reduce their burden, in order to achieve fundamental fairness and reasonableness. Under this correct tax policy of the People's Government, taxpayers were extremely enthusiastic, and the entire collection work was completed in a short thirteen days; moreover, the actual tax revenue exceeded the original total tax amount by thirty-three percent. At the beginning of the tax collection, the preparatory committee of the Federation of Industry and Commerce, together with the heads of various trade associations, formed a general evaluation meeting. The heads of various trade associations, together with the democratically elected heads of the evaluation groups, formed evaluation sub-meetings, and all burden-bearing households formed evaluation groups. Following the method of self-reporting, public discussion, comparing households, and determining quotas, and finalizing the plan in three postings, the total tax amount of 10 million yuan (Central Plains currency) was set as 200 points for democratic evaluation. The city has a total of forty-one industries, totaling 2,229 households. After investigation by the Industry and Commerce Bureau, ironwork, smelting, textile, and toothbrush industries were legally exempted from taxation, and leather, printing, shoemaking, and sewing industries were taxed at half the rate. In addition, machine-made noodles, hairdressing, and watchmaking industries were exempted because their daily income was only enough to maintain their livelihood. Twenty-eight industries, totaling 1,670 households, were fully taxed. The principle of burden-sharing was that the industrial households would not exceed 15 percent of their net profit, and the commercial households would not exceed 20 percent. When the general evaluation meeting began its evaluation, a representative of a sundry goods business, in order to reduce the burden on the industry, suggested: "There is no need to engage in debate, so as not to harm harmony; whether the evaluation is high or low is acceptable." This statement was immediately criticized by the majority of evaluators, who believed that the representative was selfish and that debate was precisely for the purpose of seeking fairness and reasonableness. In the evaluation of cotton yarn industry for setting production and determining quotas, evaluator Liu, a large merchant, attempted to reduce his own burden, and colluded with some large merchants, advocating that democratic evaluation should not be used, but should be apportioned after a few people made an overall calculation. He even threatened small merchants, saying: "Whoever does not listen to the apportionment will not be issued a business license, and whoever is not allowed to do business." The small merchants were afraid of offending the big merchants and being disadvantaged, so they dared not speak out. After the Industry and Commerce Bureau discovered this, it explained the policy of reasonable burden of the democratic government to the small merchants, and supported the small merchants to unfold democratic evaluation, so that forty-four cotton yarn households fairly and reasonably distributed the tax amount according to the size of their capital and profit. In order to make the burden more fair and reasonable, the People's Government launched merchants to report hidden merchants (i.e., merchants who do not appear as merchants but secretly engage in buying and selling speculation). Under the slogan of "Report hidden merchants, everyone bears less burden," forty-two hidden merchants were reported. In addition, thirty-three hidden merchants (most of whom were merchants with large capital) saw that there was no opportunity to take advantage of, and voluntarily reported for tax payment. The general evaluation meeting treated the reported and self-reported hidden merchants differently: those who self-reported were treated the same as ordinary households, while those who were reported had their burden doubled. Due to the above correct measures, the results of this tax collection work were good.

　　自报公议公平合理
  　许昌完成征收营业税
    【新华社中原三日电】许昌市冬季营业税征收工作业已胜利完成。该市为平汉线南段商业重镇，工商业历遭国民党匪帮严重摧残。解放初期，人民政府为使其工商业迅速恢复，曾明令豁免秋季营业税负担。此次首度开征冬季营业税，系根据分别工商、合理负担的原则，以自报公议方式，展开民主评议，揭发逃税奸商和企图减轻负担者诡计，以达到基本上的公平合理。在人民政府此种正确的税收政策下，纳税者极为踊跃，在短暂的十三天中，即全部完成征收工作；且实收税额超过原定总税额的百分之三十三。征税之初，工商联合会筹委会会同各行业公会负责人组成总评议会，以各行业公会会长加上各业民选的评议小组组长，组成评议分会，复由全体负担户分别组成评议小组，按自报公议，比户定分，三榜定案办法，将总税额一千万元（中州币）定为二百分，进行民主评议。全市共四十一个行业，计二千二百廿九户，经工商局调查后，依法免征的有铁工、冶炼、纺织、牙刷等六业，减半征收的有皮革、印刷、鞋工、缝纫四业，另有机器制面、理发、钟表三业，因其每日收入仅足以维持生活，故经民主决定亦予以免征，全征者有二十八个行业，计一千六百七十户。负担原则，工业户最高不超过其纯益的百分之十五，商业户不超过百分之廿，总评议会开始展开评议时，某杂货业代表为图减轻该业负担，提出：“不用展开争论，免伤和气，评多评少均可以。”这种发言当场即遭到多数评议员的批判，大家认为该代表是有私心的，并确信争论正是为了求得公平合理。在棉纱业比产定分的评议中，评议员大商人刘某企图减轻自己负担，乃拉拢一些大商人，主张不用民主评议，而由几个人统算后摊派下去。他并且威胁中小商人说：“谁要不听摊派，就不给谁发营业执照，谁就不准做买卖。”小商人听了后，怕得罪了大商人对自己不利，不敢做声。工商局发现后，即向小商人解释民主政府的合理负担政策，并支持小商人展开民主评议，才使四十四户棉纱业，按资本营利大小，公平合理地分配了税额。人民政府为使负担更求得进一步的公平合理，曾发动商人检举暗商（即不以商人面目出现而暗中做买卖投机的行商）。在“检举出暗商，大家少负担”的口号下，被检举的暗商达四十二户。另有三十三户暗商（他们大部是有较大资本的行商）见无隙可乘，乃自动报告纳税。总评议会对被检举的与自报的暗商，予以分别对待：自报的与普通户同，被检举的则加倍其负担。由于以上正确的措施，此次征税工作结果良好。
