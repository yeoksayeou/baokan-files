    Ping City Fire Brigade
    Greatly Reduces Fire Disaster Rate Through Strengthened Educational Work
    [Our Newspaper] The Beiping Municipal People's Government Public Security Bureau Fire Brigade has actively reformed and educated former police officers, and fire protection work has made great progress compared with the Kuomintang rule era. From February 2nd to the 19th of this month, in 46 days, there were 20 fire alarms in the city. After the brigade's rescue, only 3 became disasters, accounting for 15% of the total number of fire alarms. During the same period last year under Kuomintang rule, there were 23 fire alarms in the city, of which 7 became disasters, accounting for more than 30% of the total number of fire alarms. After the liberation of Beiping, the People's Government Public Security Bureau began to reform and strengthen the leadership of the original fire brigade. First, it implemented the policy of maintaining the original position and salary for former police officers, so as to stabilize their lives, and at the same time pay attention to reforming their ideology. After more than a month of revolutionary education, they have generally made progress.

　　平市消防队
    经过教育工作加强
    火警成灾率大减
    【本报讯】北平市人民政府公安局消防大队，积极改造教育旧员警，消防工作已较国民党统治时代大有进步。从二月二日至本月十九日四十六天中，全市火警二十处，经该队抢救，成灾者仅三处，占火警总数百分之十五。去年同期国民党统治下，全市火警二十三处，其成灾者则为七处，占火警总数百分之三十强。北平解放后，人民政府公安局即着手改造与加强对原消防大队的领导。首先对旧员警实行原职原薪，使其生活安定，同时注意改造其思想。迄今经过月余革命教育，一般获得进步。
