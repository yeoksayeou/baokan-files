　　The Current Situation in the Philippines
    By Waluofu, Translated by Yu Ruo

　　It has been more than two years since the "granting" of pseudo-independence to the Philippines. The "selfless" sweet talk of the American ruling group has vanished. The expansionist policy of American imperialism is now nakedly revealed. Now, everyone who is unwilling to deliberately close their eyes to the truth can clearly see: Under the guise of pseudo-independence, American imperialism still maintains its economic, political, and military dominance in the Philippines. Philippine-style independence has become common parlance for all political manipulations that shamelessly play with the fate of dependent nations.

　　In implementing its policy of enslaving the Philippines, American imperialism relies on the local bourgeoisie, landlords, and other exploiters. They all regard the masses of people who are carrying out national liberation struggles and demanding fundamental socio-economic reforms as their main danger. Wall Street has found the Liberal Party to be a supporter of its adventurous plans. The former leader of the party before April of this year was former President Roxas, and now it is led by current President Quirino. The American ruling group has been concerned with how to ensure that pro-American elements make up the Philippine Congress and government. In the congressional "elections," the infamous American election methods were used: extortion, vote buying, fabricating election results, persecuting progressives, stealing votes cast for progressives, and so on. Most of the members of Congress and the government betrayed the people to Japan and now serve the kingdom of gold with despicable servility. American commentator Bernstein pointed out in an overview of the Philippines: Ten of the sixteen senators had collaborated with the Japanese occupiers. In February of this year (1948 – hereinafter the same), the Philippine government passed a resolution authorizing the president to pardon the Collabo factions (fascists). Subsequently, the treason charges against three hundred prominent traitors—including Laurel, the puppet president of the Philippines during the Japanese occupation—were dropped.

　　This agency of Wall Street is implementing domestic and foreign policies that are extremely detrimental to the vital interests of the people. Congress is now discussing a draft anti-strike law similar to the Taft-Hartley Act. Regarding this issue, a newspaper published by people experienced in war wrote: "The purpose of the anti-labor program is mainly to guarantee cheap labor for American entrepreneurs." Immediately following Truman's speech on implementing universal conscription in the United States, the Philippine government also passed a resolution to increase the number of Philippine troops.

　　According to a report by the Associated Press correspondent in Manila, a "Committee to Investigate Non-Philippine Activities" has been established in the Philippine House of Representatives. Philippine Congressman Magsaysay, who currently resides in Washington, has been ordered to understand the activities of such committees in the United States in order to use their "experience" to suppress Philippine patriots.

　　In the United Nations, the Philippine delegation docilely fulfills its role as an American "voting machine." When the United Nations did not cancel the discussion on the Franco regime, the Philippine president demonstratively closed the Philippine diplomatic mission in Madrid. In April of this year, the Philippine Senate ratified a treaty of friendship with Franco's Spain.

　　However, the people of the Philippines resolutely refuse to allow their fate to be shamelessly manipulated. For the past two years, the Philippine national liberation movement has continued to expand, and this movement is led by the Democratic Alliance—a mass organization of workers, peasants, petty bourgeoisie, and advanced intellectuals.

　　The Democratic Alliance—whose leading force is the Communist Party of the Philippines—emerged under the slogans of "completely eliminating American rule," "abolishing American naval and air bases," "American troops withdraw from the Philippines," and "establishing a genuine democratic republic and implementing fundamental socio-economic reforms." In a relatively short period of time, the Democratic Alliance has become an organization of the broad masses of the people, who place their hopes for liberation from American imperialist enslavement on the alliance. The strongest forces in the alliance are the Hukbalahap guerrillas, the Philippine Trade Union Congress, and the National Peasants' Union. The guerrillas (i.e., the People's Liberation Army) have been actively carrying out armed resistance for almost three years. According to official Philippine government statistics, the number of guerrillas is about 200,000. Under the control of the guerrillas are the wealthiest provinces of Luzon—Pampanga, Nueva Ecija, Bulacan, Tarlac, and Laguna. There are also guerrilla zones on the islands of Mindanao and Negros. Democratic reforms have been implemented in the areas controlled by the guerrillas. In particular, the land of landlords and the church has been confiscated and distributed to the peasants. The Philippine Trade Union Congress, which had only 250 members in 1945, has now grown to 80,000.

　　Three years of military and police operations, although American troops and spies have also participated, have not destroyed the strength of the patriotic fighters. The Philippine president has declared the Hukbalahap and the National Peasants' Union illegal. The Hukbalahap replied that it would not lay down its arms until the Philippines achieved complete independence. After the reactionaries' attempt to defeat the national liberation movement in open battle failed, they resorted to deceptive tricks, promising guerrillas that if they surrendered and handed over their weapons, they would be granted amnesty. They also lured the guerrillas, allowing them to be given land and providing them with loans to prepare for economic necessities. The reactionaries intended to use this method to split the strength of the resistance movement. The Hukbalahap proposed that the conditions for implementing an "armed truce" were the establishment of a genuine democratic government that could guarantee the struggle to eliminate the Philippines' colonial dependence on the United States and could guarantee the implementation of genuine democratic reforms. The government had to announce for the second time that it was extending the amnesty period from June 21st. Finally, on the eve of the expiration of the amnesty (August 15th), the chief of the Philippine police had to announce that only 189 of the 200,000 guerrillas had surrendered since June 25th, and only ten of them had handed over their weapons. On August 17th, President Quirino announced the resumption of police operations to deal with the guerrillas. The reactionaries' attempt to destroy the fighting spirit of the Philippine patriots has failed so shamefully.

　　The American colonial group is taking various measures to quickly destroy the Philippine national liberation movement. In addition to its colonial plans for the Philippines itself, in American imperialist strategy, the Philippines is being used as its most important stronghold for aggression in the Western Pacific, especially against the national liberation movements in Southeast Asia—Indonesia, Vietnam, Burma, Malaya, and other places.

　　The Philippine national liberation movement is emerging in the common front of colonies and dependent countries against international reactionaries headed by the American ruling group.

　　菲律宾现势
    瓦洛夫  作  愉若  译
    自“赐与”菲律宾伪独立后，迄今已二年有余了。美国统治集团“大公无私”的甜言蜜语已经消逝了。美帝的扩张政策赤裸裸地呈现出来了。现在，每个不愿意在真情实况面前故意闭起眼睛的人，都能看得明白：在伪独立的外幕下面，美帝仍然保持了它在菲岛的经济、政治与军事统治地位。菲律宾式的独立，已成为无耻玩弄附属国人民命运的一切政治策动的共通用语了。
    美帝在实现其奴役菲律宾的政策中，是依靠着当地的资产阶级、地主和其他剥削分子的。他们全都把正在进行民族解放斗争并要求实现根本社会经济改革的人民大众，视为自己的主要危险。华尔街发现了自由党是其冒险计划的拥护者，该党在今年四月以前的领导人是前任总统罗哈斯，而如今则是由现总统季里诺领导的，美国统治集团所曾关心的，是如何保证由亲美分子来组成菲律宾国会和政府。在国会“选举”中，采用了臭名远扬的美国选举办法：敲诈勒索，收买选票，捏造选举结果，追究进步人士，窃取投给进步分子的选票等等。国会与政府人员中的大多数，曾把人民出卖给日本，现在则卑鄙地为金元王国效劳。美国评论家伯恩斯坦在菲律宾概论中指出：十六个参议员中，有十个曾与日本占领者合作。今（一九四八——下同）年二月，菲律宾政府通过了授权总统大赦考拉博马派（法西斯派）的决议。随后，又取消了控告三百个著名卖国贼——其中有日军占领时代的菲律宾傀儡总统洛勒尔——的叛变罪案。
    华尔街的这个代理机关，实现着极端违反人民切身利益的内政外交。国会现在讨论类似塔虎脱——哈特莱反劳工法的禁止罢工的法律草案。关于这个问题，富有战争经验的人们所出版的报纸写道：“反劳工纲领的目的，主要是为美国企业家保障廉价的劳动力。”紧接着杜鲁门关于在美国施行普遍军役的发言之后，菲律宾政府也通过了增加菲军员额的决议。
    据合众社驻马尼拉记者报导，在菲律宾下院内设立了“非菲活动调查委员会”。现居华盛顿的菲国会议员马格西西，曾受命了解美国这类委员会的活动，以便运用其“经验”来镇压菲律宾爱国分子。
    在联合国内，菲律宾代表团驯顺地尽着美国“投票机器”的作用。当联合国不取消关于佛朗哥政体的讨论时，菲律宾总统示威性地公开了菲律宾驻马德里的外交使团。本年四月，菲参院批准了与佛朗哥西班牙的友好条约。
    然而，菲岛人民坚决拒绝使自己的命运受人无耻玩弄。整整两年来，菲岛民族解放运动继续不断地扩大，这个运动是由民主联盟——工、农、小资产阶级与先进知识分子的群众组织领导的。
    民主联盟——其领导力量就是菲律宾共产党——是在“完全消灭美国统治”“取消美国海、空根据地”“美军撤出菲律宾”“建立真正的民主共和国，实行根本的社会经济改革”等口号下出现的。在比较短的时间内，民主联盟已成为广大民众的组织，人民大众把摆脱美帝奴役争取解放的希望寄托在联盟身上，联盟中最强大的力量，是呼克伯拉海白的游击队、菲律宾职工联合会和民族农民联盟。游击队（即民抗军）积极进行武装反抗，差不多已有三年了。据菲政府官方统计，游击队员人数约有二十万。在游击队控制之下的，有菲岛最富裕的省份吕宋——班邦加，奴瓦伊西加，布拉坎，塔尔拉克和拉格纳，在民答那峨岛和内格罗（黑人）岛上，也有游击区。在游击队控制的地区，实行了民主改革。特别是没收地主与教会的土地分给农民。菲律宾职工联合会，一九四五年只有二百五十个会员，现已发展到八万。
    三年来的军事、警察行动，虽然也有美国部队和间谍参加，却并未摧毁爱国志士的力量。菲总统曾宣布呼克伯拉海白和民族农民联盟为非法。呼克伯拉海白答称：直至菲律宾达到完全的独立以前，他不会放下武器。反动派想在公开战斗中击溃民族解放运动的企图失败后，就玩弄欺骗手腕，约许游击队员如果投降与缴出武器，就可以受到大赦。又利诱游击队员，允许分给他们土地，给他们贷款以备办经济必要品。反动派曾打算用这样的方法，来分裂反抗运动的力量。呼克伯拉海白提议，实行“武装休战”的条件，是建立真正的民主政府，这个政府能够保证为消除菲律宾对于美国的殖民地附庸地位而斗争，并能保证实行真正的民主改革。政府不得不第二次宣布，自六月二十一日起延长大赦期限。最后，在大赦满期（八月十五日）的前夜，菲律宾警察总长不得不宣布：自六月二十五日起，二十万个游击队员中只有一百八十九人投降，而且其中缴出武器的仅仅十人。八月十七日，季里诺总统宣布重新进行警察活动以对付游击队员。反动派要想摧毁菲律宾爱国志士战斗精神的企图，是如此可耻地失败了。
    美国的殖民集团正在采取种种措施，以便赶快摧毁菲律宾民族解放运动。除了对于菲岛本身的殖民计划以外，在美帝战略中，是把菲岛作为其侵略西太平洋，特别是反对东南亚——印尼、越南、缅甸、马来亚等地民族解放运动的最重要的据点。
    菲岛民族解放运动，是在殖民地与附属国反对以美国统治集团为首的国际反动派的共同战线中出现的。
