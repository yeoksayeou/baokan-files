To Go to Dalian, You Can Take a Ship from Tianjin

　　Mr. Liu Tefu:

　　According to our information, there are steamships from Tianjin to Dalian. If you want to go to Dalian, you can first go to the Public Security Bureau to apply for a pass, and then go to Hongcheng Shipping Company at No. 3, Fu'an Lane, Shenyang Road, Tianjin to buy a ticket and board the ship.

　　要去大连可往天津搭船刘特夫君：
    据我们了解，天津有开往大连的汽船，你如去大连，可先到公安局办理通行手续，然后赴天津市沈阳路辅安里三号鸿程船务行买票登船。
