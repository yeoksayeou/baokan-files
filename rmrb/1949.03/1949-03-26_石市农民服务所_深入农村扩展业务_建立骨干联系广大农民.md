　　Shijiazhuang Farmer Service Center
    Deepens its Reach into Rural Areas, Expands Business
　  Establishes Key Contacts to Connect with the Broad Masses of Farmers
    [Our Dispatch] In order to establish close ties between the urban and rural masses, and gradually alleviate the intermediate exploitation suffered by farmers and city dwellers at the hands of merchants, the Shijiazhuang City Supply and Marketing Cooperative established a Farmer Service Center in January. In the past three months, it has achieved considerable success. In the early stages of operation, due to lack of experience, it first engaged in a mixed business of cart shops and inn services. According to incomplete statistics from January 10th to March 14th, more than 200 farmers and more than 70 carts have been served by the center. It has also helped them buy back more than 111,200 jin of coal, more than 5,000 jin of cottonseed hulls, and one waterwheel; and helped sell 1,753 jin of cotton, 2,000 jin of cabbage, 200 jin of thread, and other goods such as cloth, oil, rice, flour, and utensils. With the enthusiastic help of the service center, farmers feel that buying, selling, accommodation, and meals are convenient and save money. As a result, the number of farmers coming to the center is increasing day by day, and the center's accommodation is becoming insufficient. Improvements are now being planned. In order to further expand the scope of services, the center has sent cadres to dozens of villages in Zhao County, Luancheng, Julu and other counties to carry out propaganda and establish key contact personnel, welcoming the broad masses of farmers to the service center for transactions.
    [Another Dispatch] In order to organize poor women to engage in production and solve their livelihood difficulties, and thereby lay the foundation for the establishment of women's cooperatives, the Shijiazhuang City Supply and Marketing Cooperative began organizing working women in February. In one month, sixty-eight working women were organized to engage in making paper padding and spinning hemp rope. The cooperative sold 324 jin of hemp material, 204 jin of white flour, and 368 jin of rags at low prices; purchased 204 jin of finished hemp rope and 111 sheets of paper padding; and sold 136 jin of finished hemp rope and 57 sheets of paper padding. The women earned a total of 7,140 yuan in wages, equivalent to 637 jin of millet. Based on a consumption of 2 jin of rice per person per day, this can solve the livelihood of 318 people for one day. Another group of women was organized to dismantle, wash, mend, and make shoe soles. The wages earned also solved some livelihood difficulties. (Zhao Gang)

　　石市农民服务所
    深入农村扩展业务
　  建立骨干联系广大农民
    【本报讯】石家庄市供销合作总社为建立城市与乡村群众的密切联系，逐渐减轻农民和城市里所受商人的中间剥削，特于元月间设立农民服务所，三个月来，已获相当成就。开办初期，由于缺乏经验，所以先经营人车店和客货栈的混合业务。据一月十日至三月十四日的不完全统计，已有二百余农民、七十余辆大车受到该所的招待。并帮助他们买回煤十一万一千二百余斤，购买棉子皮五千余斤，水车一辆；帮助推销棉花一千七百五十三斤，白菜二千斤，线子二百斤，其他布匹、油、米面、用具等货物亦做不少成交的介绍工作。农民在服务所的热心帮助下，感到买卖以及住宿、吃饭均方便省钱。因之，农民来所者日益增加，该所住处已感不足供应，现正谋改善。该所为更进一步扩大服务范围，特派出干部到赵县、栾城、巨鹿等县数十村进行宣传，建立骨干联系人员，欢迎广大农民到服务所进行成交。
    【又讯】石市供销合作总社为组织贫苦妇女从事生产，解决她们的生活困难，以此打下建立妇女合作社的基础，特于二月间开始组织劳动妇女。一个月中，组织了六十八个劳动妇女从事打夹纸、纺麻绳，合作社以低价售出麻料三百二十四斤、白面二百零四斤、破布三百六十八斤；收购成品麻绳二百零四斤、夹纸一百一十一张；推销成品麻绳一百三十六斤、夹纸五十七张，妇女们共得工资七千一百四十元，合小米六百三十七斤。按每人每天食米二斤计，能解决三百一十八人一天的生活。另组织了一部妇女拆洗、缝补、纳鞋底，所赚工资也解决了一部生活困难。（赵刚）
