　　The CPC Chahar Province Fourth Prefectural Committee Calls on Cadres
    Each to Save Ten Jin of Grain to Help the Masses Overcome the Spring Famine
    [Reported by This Newspaper] The CPC Chahar Province Fourth Prefectural Committee recently issued a call to save food grain to help the masses overcome the spring famine. It stated: A portion of our region suffered severe drought, flooding, and hail disasters last year, resulting in a serious spring famine. Many families of revolutionary martyrs and soldiers lacking labor, as well as impoverished masses who have just been allocated land but have poor operating conditions, are experiencing great difficulties in their lives. Therefore, it is imperative to urgently find ways to help them. In addition to studying solutions, the Prefectural Committee will soon implement them. It specifically calls on cadres at all levels to save ten jin of millet each from their food rations from April to the end of December, a period of nine months. The millet will be centrally managed by the sub-district to help the masses overcome the spring famine. (Note: The Fourth Prefectural Committee's area includes: Zhengding, Fuping, Jingxing, Xingtang, Huolu, Pingshan, Lingshou, Quyang, Jianping, and Zhengding City.)

    每人节约十斤粮帮助群众渡春荒
    【本报讯】中共察省四地委，顷号召节约食粮，帮助群众渡过春荒。略称：我区一部份地区，去年遭受严重旱、涝、雹灾，形成严重春荒。不少无劳力的烈军工属，及刚分到土地而经营条件很差的贫苦群众生活很困难。因此，必须紧急设法予以帮助。现地委除正在研讨办法，并将很快付诸实现外，特号召我各级干部自四月起至十二月底，九个月内每人从伙食中节约小米十斤，由分区统一掌握，帮助群众渡过春荒。（按四地委地区为：正定、阜平、井陉、行唐、获鹿、平山、灵寿、曲阳、建屏及正定市。）
