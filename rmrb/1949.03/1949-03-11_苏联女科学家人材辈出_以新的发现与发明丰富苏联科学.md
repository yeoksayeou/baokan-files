    有二百三十七位妇女由于对科学、发明、艺术与文学有了出色的贡献，已经荣获斯大林奖金。有好几位女科学家因为研究机械学和数学而驰名。苏联科学院通讯会员泡鲁巴林娃、科契娜就是其中的一个。她研究出地下水的运动的原理，对灌溉与用水供应有巨大的重要性。她在去年被选为苏联女科学家的代表，出席在布达佩斯举行的国际妇女代表大会。人们普遍认为有功的还有该科学院生理研究所副所长安娜·东贺教授。由于精心研究伟大的生理学家巴夫洛夫的先进科学思想，她在生理学的高度神经活动方面，有很大贡献。苏联妇女在人类学方面也有许多宝贵的贡献，该科学院通信会员巴克拉托娃关于工人阶级历史的研究，在苏联历史科学方面写下了崭新的一页。涅塞贺娃教授是研究俄国十八、十九世纪历史的专家和研究十二月党人革命活动的权威。
