(Jizhong Electric) The first Communist Youth League Congress convened by the Youth Committee of the Hebei-Central Hebei District Party Committee successfully concluded on the 16th of last month, lasting eight days. A total of 127 Communist Youth League representatives from various special districts, counties, cities, factories, schools, and government organs attended the meeting, along with more than 100 representatives from administrative organs, organizations, and local and county committees. At the meeting, Comrade Tian Guang, Secretary of the Youth Committee of the Hebei-Central Hebei District Party Committee, reported on the significance and tasks of the congress. He also conveyed the decision of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party regarding the establishment of the Chinese New Democratic Youth League. Subsequently, the congress conducted group discussions. Representatives from local and county committees attending the meeting reviewed their leadership in youth work and pointed out that some vague concepts still existed. For example, some county committees even considered youth work an "extra burden," which led to some areas relaxing their leadership over youth work and allowing it to develop freely. The Youth Committees at various levels also had shortcomings in their work, such as being timid and relying solely on the Party Committee without taking initiative. Some youth cadres even mistakenly believed that youth work had no status and were therefore slack and unwilling to move forward. These erroneous understandings and tendencies were strictly criticized through discussion. After the group discussions, the Youth Committee of the District Party Committee made a summary report on the four months of national construction work in Hebei-Central Hebei, and pointed out that the current specific guidelines for national construction should be to extensively and deeply mobilize the broad masses of young people to participate in the large-scale production movement on the basis of the existing work. In this year's agricultural production movement and production competition, the New Democratic Youth League should be developed in a focused and conditional manner. Secondly, young people should be mobilized to take the lead in supporting the front lines. At the end of the congress, Tian Guang, Jin Hui and 20 other people were elected as representatives of Hebei-Central Hebei to attend the North China Youth League Congress, and eight members of the Hebei-Central Hebei New Democratic Youth League Preparatory Committee were elected.
(Zhangjiakou Electric) The first Communist Youth League Congress of Chahar Province opened on the 19th of last month. After conveying the resolution of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party on January 1, 1949, regarding the establishment of the Chinese New Democratic Youth League and summarizing the experience of Chahar Province in piloting the establishment of the New Democratic Youth League over the past two years, the conference also formulated the following national construction guidelines and plans for this year: Continue to implement the principle of the whole party running the League, promote and train an appropriate number of specialized cadres for national construction work, and shift from the scattered pilot period of the past to a stage of systematic and focused universal promotion. This year, it is required to universally establish the League in factories, schools, and outside villages and towns in Chahar Province. On the 24th, the day the conference closed, Sun Jingwen, Hu Kaiming, Tian Jian and 24 other people were elected as preparatory committee members, and the Chahar New Democratic Youth League Preparatory Committee was officially established. The congress also elected Yu Hui and eight others as representatives to attend the First North China Communist Youth League Congress.

　　冀中·察哈尔召开团代大会
    【冀中电】冀中区党委青委会召开的首届青年团代表会议，历时八天，于上月十六日胜利闭幕。出席此次会议的有各专区、县、市青年团代表和各工厂、学校、机关的青年团代表共一百二十七名，行署级各机关团体及各地委、县委代表列席参加的共一百余名。会中由冀中区党委青委书记田广同志报告了此次会议的意义和任务。并对中共中央关于建立中国新民主主义青年团的决定作了传达，接着大会进行了分组讨论，列席会议的各地县委检查对青年工作的领导中，指出仍存在某些模糊观念，如个别县委竟认为青年工作是“额外负担”，因之，有些地区曾经放松了对青年工作的领导，任其自流。各级党委青委本身还存在着工作怯弱，单纯依靠党委而不主动去工作的缺点。甚至有的青年干部，错误地认为作青年工作没地位，而懈怠不前。这些错误认识和倾向，经过大家讨论，进行了严格的批判。小组讨论结束后，区党委青委会对冀中四个月的建国工作曾作总结报告，并指出目前建国具体方针，应是在已有的工作基础上，普遍深入地发动广大青年参加大生产运动。在今年的农业生产运动和生产竞赛中，有重点有条件地发展建立新民主主义青年团。其次要动员青年在支接前线中起带头作用。大会最后选出冀中出席华北青年团代表会的代表田广、靳辉等二十人及冀中新民主主义青年团筹备委员会委员八人。
