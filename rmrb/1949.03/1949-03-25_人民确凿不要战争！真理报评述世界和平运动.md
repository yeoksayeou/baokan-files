　　The People Absolutely Do Not Want War!
　　*Pravda* Comments on the World Peace Movement
　　(Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 23rd) TASS, Moscow, 20th: *Pravda*’s foreign affairs commentator, Viktorov, today commented on the powerful movement to defend peace in various countries around the world, saying: "The movement for lasting democratic peace continues to flourish. Its enormous scale vividly and definitively proves that the people of all countries do not want war. The number of supporters of the peace policy firmly pursued by the democratic camp led by the Soviet Union is truly incalculable. The peace movement is the answer of the people of all countries to the war instigators." Viktorov continued: "Communists in various countries naturally and actively participate in this movement and are at the forefront of the movement because they are the vanguard of the working class. The broad masses of the people are increasingly convinced that it is the Communists who are faithfully committed to the cause of peace, that it is the Communists who are the true defenders of national interests, and that they are true patriots. The enormous scale of the movement for lasting democratic peace shows that the broad masses of the people clearly foresee that the adventurous policies of the Anglo-American ruling groups will have disastrous consequences because of the development of the peace movement. The people of all countries are vigilantly defending peace, closely watching all the tricks of the warmongers."

　　人民确凿不要战争！
    真理报评述世界和平运动
    【新华社陕北二十三日电】塔斯社莫斯科二十日讯：真理报外交评论员维克托洛夫今日评述世界各国保卫和平的强大运动称：争取持久的民主的和平运动继续蓬勃地展开，其巨大规模生动地与确凿地证明各国人民不要战争。苏联领导的民主阵营所坚定奉行的和平政策之支持者，其数目确实是不可计算的。和平运动是各国人民对战争挑拨者的回答。维氏继称：各国共产党人自然而然地积极参加这一运动，并走在运动的最前列，因为他们是工人阶级的先锋。广大人民群众愈来愈加深信，正是共产党人忠诚地致力于和平事业，正是共产党人是民族利益的真正的保卫者，是真正的爱国主义者。争取持久的民主的和平运动的巨大规模显示：广大人民群众清楚地预见到英美统治集团的冒险政策将因和平运动的发展而招致悲惨后果。各国人民在警惕地保卫着和平，密切地注视着战争贩子的一切诡计。
