Jilu Yu Telegram: In order to implement the North China People's Government's decision on agency production, the Administrative Office convened a regional agency production conference in Heze on February 16th to establish a unified leadership structure. Fifteen representatives from agencies under the Administrative Office, the military region, and various special districts attended, representing stores and factories involved in agency production from thirty agencies. At the beginning of the meeting, Bian Yukun, Director of the Finance Department, and Zhang Lianfang, Director of the Industry and Commerce Department, successively conveyed the New Democratic economic policy and the North China People's Government's decision on agency production. Then the meeting moved into reviewing past management approaches and discussing future policies. After repeated discussions, the comrades attending unanimously agreed that the main deviations in the past were a purely profit-oriented viewpoint and a lack of organization and anarchic state in management. As a result, speculators were given opportunities, causing undue losses to the state. In studying the decision of the North China People's Government, the future direction of agency production was clarified, and the following specific decisions were made: (1) Agencies should engage in agricultural and handicraft production. Agencies above the special district level can engage in industrial production. The existing business operations must resolutely implement government decrees in the future and closely integrate with state-owned commerce and state banks to support cooperatives, conduct exchanges of agricultural and industrial products, and stabilize prices. The specific tasks are to absorb local people's sideline and handicraft products, as well as surplus local products, adjust them to cities or other regions, purchase industrial products to supply the masses, and complete the tasks entrusted by state-owned stores. (2) It was decided to establish a unified organizational structure for the entire region to strengthen the leadership and management of agency production, correctly implement policies, and serve the construction of the New Democratic economy. It was determined that a "General Management Department" should be established at the Administrative Office level to lead the production stores of various directly affiliated agencies at the Administrative Office level and the "Management Departments" established at the special district level. The Management Departments of the Administrative Office and special districts should be led by the government's industry and commerce departments in their business operations. At the same time, in areas with a large number of agency production units, such as Puyang, Liaocheng, and Heze, a "Agency Production Management Committee" should be established to unify steps. The committee would also be led by the local government's industry and commerce departments. (3) Regarding the scope of operations, it was determined that the business address of each store should be based on the principle of being in the district where it is located. Business organizations of stores outside this district and outside the North China region should be quickly withdrawn, and those that cannot be withdrawn immediately should stop operating. Other issues concerning the division of business, organizational discipline, and personnel supply standards were all specified in accordance with the decisions of the North China People's Government.

　　统一管理机关生产
  　冀鲁豫行署专署成立经理处
    【冀鲁豫电】行署为贯彻华北人民政府对机关生产的决定，于二月十六日在菏泽召开全区机关生产会议，建立统一领导机构。到会有行署、军区及各专署所属机关生产代表十五位，代表三十个机关生产的商店、工厂。会议开始由财政处长边裕鲲、工商处长张廉方，相继传达新民主主义经济政策及华北人民政府对机关生产的决定之后，随即进入检讨过去经营路线及讨论今后方针问题。经反复讨论，到会同志一致认为过去的主要偏向是单纯的利润观点和经营上的无组织无政府状态，因此，就给投机者以可乘之机，造成国家的不应有的损失。在研究华北人民政府的决定中，明确了今后机关生产方针，并作出如下具体决定：（一）应从事农业、手工业生产，专署以上机关可进行工业生产，现有之企业经营，今后必须坚决执行政府法令，并与国营商业及国家银行密切结合，扶植合作社，进行农产品与工业品之交换，稳定物价。具体的任务是吸收当地群众副业、手工业产品，以及剩余土产，调剂到城市或外区，采购工业品供给群众，完成国营商店之委托任务。（二）确定建立全区的统一组织机构，以加强机关生产之领导与管理，正确执行政策，为新民主主义经济建设服务。行署级生产机关确定成立“总经理处”，领导行署级各直属机关生产商店及各专区一级所设之“经理处”。行署及专署之经理处均应由政府工商部门在业务上进行领导。同时在机关生产单位较多的地方，如濮阳、聊城、菏泽三地，成立“机关生产管理委员会”，以统一步调。该委员会亦受当地政府工商部门领导。（三）关于经营范围，确定各店营业地址，以所在区本区为原则，在本区以外及华北区以外之商店营业组织迅速撤回，不能马上撤回者应即停止营业。其他关于经营分工、组织纪律、人员供给标准等问题，均根据华北人民政府之决定，作出具体的规定。
