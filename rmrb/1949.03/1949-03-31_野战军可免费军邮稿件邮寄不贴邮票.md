To Comrades Shen Zhongyuan, Ren Jianmin, and Geng Jianxin: Regarding the questions about army mail and manuscripts, the answers are as follows: 1. According to the regulations of the North China People's Government, in order to facilitate army mail, special military postal services are established in various units. All letters from officers and soldiers of the field armies can be mailed free of charge to the military post office according to regulations. If they are mailed to local post offices, they are not free. Letters from military dependents are the same as ordinary letters and are not free either.

For news agencies that have entered into contracts with the post office, where postage is paid uniformly by the news agency, news manuscripts sent by correspondents to that news agency are free of charge. Just indicate "News Manuscript" on the envelope and cut open the upper right corner for mailing. This applies to submissions to the People's Daily and the North China Branch of Xinhua News Agency. Those without contracts must affix sufficient postage.

2. As for why the letters received by the families of Comrade Geng Jianxin and others are slow or not received, we cannot find out the specific reasons because they did not specify which post office they were delivered to, where they were sent, what the registered number was, or when they were mailed. Generally speaking, in addition to postal issues, there are several reasons for slow mail: for example, delays in the receipt and dispatch by organizations, backward rural transportation, imperfect township postal organizations, and frequent backlogs from the district to the village. In addition, the sender can take the receipt from the original registered letter to the original post office to check, and we will definitely cooperate in the investigation. As for drafts, after they arrive at the post office, regulations stipulate that they will not be returned until one month has passed and the person entitled to the money has not come to the post office to collect it. They are not returned immediately.

### 野战军可免费军邮稿件邮寄不贴邮票

　　野战军可免费军邮稿件邮寄不贴邮票
    沈仲元、任健民、耿建新诸同志：关于军队寄信及稿件诸问题答复如下：一、按照华北人民政府的规定，为便利军队寄信起见，特在各部队专设军邮。凡野战军将士的信件，一律可按规定向军邮局免费交寄。若向地方邮局交寄，则不免费。军属寄信与普通信件同，也不免费。
    凡报社与邮局订立合同，邮费由报社统一交纳者，通讯员给该报社所寄之新闻稿件即不纳费。只要在封面上注明“新闻稿件”字样，右上角剪开，即可邮寄。如给人民日报、新华社华北总分社寄稿等皆是。未订合同者，则须贴足邮票。
    二、耿建新等同志所问他们家里收信为什么慢或收不到，因没说明交到哪个邮局，寄到哪里，挂号号码是多少，何时交寄的，所以我们无法查出具体的原因。一般说来，除邮局问题外，信件慢还有几个原因：比如机关收发耽误，乡村交通工具落后，乡邮组织不健全，从区到村常有积压等。另外寄信者还可以拿上原来寄挂号信时的报据到原寄局查一下，我们一定协力追查。至于汇票，到了邮局以后，规定要等一个月时间取钱人不到局取钱时，才退回去。并不是马上就退回去。
