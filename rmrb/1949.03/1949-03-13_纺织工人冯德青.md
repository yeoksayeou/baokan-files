　　Textile Worker Feng Deqing
　　Feng Deqing is from Sanquan Village, Yangquan City. His family was very poor, and he followed his father to the kiln to carry coal from a very young age. After the Japanese devils came, he worked in coal mines such as the Second Mine and the Fourth Mine. He felt that the hard days were unbearable. At the age of seventeen, he fled to the liberated area of ​​Yu County and was introduced by his uncle to the Quyang Textile Factory to learn yarn spinning on a spinning machine. Later, he went to the special commissioner's spinning training class to continue his studies. Because he was focused, did not fear hardship, and was not afraid of the cold, he soon learned spinning techniques. He worked steadily. Sometimes he was sick and could not do heavy work, so he voluntarily helped to twist flower lines, so he also learned the technique of twisting flower lines.
　　When he was a worker in the spinning training class, he was assigned to guide spinning techniques in the joint village spinning training class of the Zhongshe community in Yu County. In nine months, he educated more than ten spinning apprentices. In order to inspire everyone's enthusiasm for labor, he worked on the machine himself and led everyone. Therefore, he had a high prestige among the workers and apprentices, and he could represent the opinions of the workers and apprentices and reflect them to the leaders. He could also implement the production plans of the leaders to every worker and apprentice. He received an award in the Zhongshe community.
　　In January 1948, he was transferred to the Yangquan City Textile Factory to guide spinning techniques. He showed more enthusiasm in his work. There were great difficulties at the beginning of the factory's construction, and he tried his best to overcome them. For example, equipping textiles, making buckets, and making parts all took a lot of hard work. He also patiently taught apprentices spinning techniques. He maintained the same labor system as the workers and apprentices. He paid great attention to the care of factory tools and the saving of raw materials. He picked up the waste thread thrown in the yard. When he saw that the cotton was not easy to use and the raw materials were wasted, he went to the wind bow to find the problem and tried to repair it, and personally played the flower. At the same time, he created a method of using less oil on the spinning machine.
　　He usually paid attention to learning. After the Trade Union Federation arranged learning for each employee, he became more active in learning. He learned in his spare time, wishing he could learn it all at once. But because he had not read for half a day since he was a child, he had to slowly learn from the root. First, he learned to recognize new characters and read textbooks. Since November last year, he has gone to the People's Education Center to find someone to teach him characters every day, regardless of the cold wind. After returning, in addition to reviewing what he learned that day, he also had to write a piece. With such efforts, he has learned the fourth volume of elementary school Chinese and the Party member's textbook, and he can barely write letters. In arithmetic, he has learned addition and subtraction and two-digit multiplication by pen, and he has learned simple multiplication and division by abacus.

　　纺织工人冯德青
    冯德青是阳泉市三泉村人，家里很穷，很小就跟爹上窑担炭，日本鬼子来后就在二矿、四矿等处下煤窑；他觉着苦日难熬，十七岁时，逃到了盂县解放区，由他舅父介绍到曲阳纺织厂学习纱机纺纱，以后又到专署的纺纱训练班继续学习。因为他专心，不害苦，不怕凉，不久就学会了纺纱技术，一直踏实的工作，有时有病不能做较重的活，就主动的打帮搓花拐线，所以又学会了搓花拐线的技术。
    在纺纱训练班当工人时，曾分配到盂县中社小区的联村纺织训练班指导纺纱技术，九个月的时间内，教育了十多个纺纱学徒。为了启发大家的劳动积极性，他自己上机劳动，带领大家。所以他在工人、学徒中威信很高，能代表工人、学徒的意见，反映给领导上；也能将领导上的生产计划贯彻到每个工人、学徒中去。在中社小区社，曾获奖励。
    一九四八年一月，他又被调到阳泉市纺织厂指导纺纱技术，在工作中表现更为积极。开始建设工厂有很大困难，他都努力设法克服，如装备纺织，打桶子、做零件，都下了不少的辛苦，又耐心教学徒纺纱技术，他和工人、学徒同样的坚持劳动制度，对工厂工具的爱护和原料的节省上很重视，他看到了院里扔的烂线也拾起来，看到棉花不好用，浪费原料时就自己到风弓上去，找毛病设法修理，亲自弹花，同时创造了纱机上少搞油的办法。
    他平时就很注意学习，总工会布置了每个职工的学习以后，他在学习方面更积极了，抽空就学，恨不得一下就学会，但因他自己从小未念过半天书只好慢慢的从根本上学起，首先学的识生字念课本，自去年十一月份开始，每天不管寒风冷凛，总要到民教馆找人教字，回来后，除复习当日学习的东西外，还要写做一张。在这样的努力下，已念会了初小国语四册和党员课本，而且还能勉强写信；在算术方面，笔算学会了加减和两位的乘法，珠算学会了简单的乘除法。
