　　Worldwide Peace Forces Unite to Crush the Conspiracies of War Provocateurs!
　　The U.S. imperialist government refuses to engage in peaceful negotiations with the Soviet Union, rejects Soviet proposals for disarmament, the prohibition of atomic weapons, and the control of atomic energy, actively carries out activities to establish the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, and strives to expand the scope of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and the network of U.S. military bases. This series of actions further exposes the face of the provocateurs of a new world war. The international reactionaries, headed by U.S. imperialism, are dreaming of finding a way out of the crisis through war, as the severe economic and political crises within the entire imperialist front exist and are increasingly developing. Therefore, the danger of a new world war exists, and all peace-loving people around the world must unite and struggle against the danger of a new war.
　　The danger of war exists, but as long as all peace-loving forces around the world unite and fight, the danger of war can be completely overcome. This is because, first, the people of all countries do not want war; only a small number of war profiteers hope for war. Second, the people of all countries not only have the desire for peace but also have an organized force to strive for peace. The core of this force is the socialist state of the Soviet Union, the people's democratic countries, the communist parties of all countries in the capitalist world, revolutionary trade unions, and other revolutionary people's organizations. All these forces have greatly developed during and after World War II. Third, because of this, war provocateurs are isolated and outwardly strong but inwardly weak. They cannot but encounter serious internal contradictions and serious contradictions between the bourgeoisies of various countries and between various factions of the bourgeoisie. The forces of peace outweigh the forces of war provocation. As long as the peace-loving forces of the world, especially the revolutionary forces of the world's working class, are fully vigilant, do not underestimate their own strength and overestimate the enemy's strength, unite and persevere in their struggle, then they will surely be able to defeat the war provocateurs and overcome the danger of a new world war.
　　To overcome the danger of a new war, peace-loving forces around the world are taking active action. Stalin, the great leader of mankind fighting for peace, twice declared the Soviet Union's firm and unwavering peace policy on January 30th and February 2nd this year, expressing the Soviet Union's willingness to discuss disputes between the two countries with the United States, and expressing Stalin's own willingness to confer with Truman. Stalin's two statements have been warmly praised by peace-loving public opinion in various countries around the world. The Soviet Foreign Ministry's statement on the North Atlantic Treaty Organization on January 28th thoroughly exposed the war plans of the Anglo-American aggressive bloc and further aroused the vigilance of world peace forces. The communist parties of various capitalist countries stand at the forefront of the people's anti-war struggle in the capitalist world. The continuous statements by French Communist Party leader Thorez on February 22nd, 23rd, and 24th, especially the statement on the 24th that if an anti-Soviet war breaks out, the French working class and the French people will stand on the side of the Soviet Union and welcome the Soviet army liberating France after pursuing the aggressors, and the similar statement made by Italian Communist Party leader Togliatti on February 26th, created a great mobilization of the working class and revolutionary people in the capitalist world. The Communist Party of Great Britain, the Communist Party of the United States, the Socialist Unity Party of Germany, the Communist Party of Austria, the Communist Party of Denmark, the Labor-Progressive Party of Canada, the Communist Party of Mexico, the Communist Party of the Philippines, the Communist Party of Sweden, the Communist Party of Argentina, the Communist Party of Australia, the Communist Party of Belgium, the Communist Party of the Netherlands, and the Communist Party of Brazil have all successively issued statements responding to the call of Thorez and Togliatti. At the same time, on February 24th, the International Liaison Committee of the World Congress of Intellectuals for Peace, the Women's International Democratic Federation, and well-known cultural, scientific, and artistic workers jointly issued a declaration proposing to convene a World Peace Congress in April this year. This proposal has been widely supported by workers' organizations, women's organizations, youth organizations, cultural organizations, religious organizations, and cultural workers around the world. Peace-loving humanity is now determined to meet the conspiracies of the war provocateurs!
　　We, the Chinese people, will undoubtedly strive to support the call of the world peace forces. China is a country that has suffered deeply from imperialist aggression and the disasters of imperialist wars of aggression. The imperialists have not only long and directly used force to invade us, but have also long supported the Chinese reactionaries in carrying out counter-revolutionary civil war. Until now, the military forces of U.S. imperialism are still stationed and establishing military bases on Chinese territory for no reason. Until now, the counter-revolutionary civil war launched and continued by the Kuomintang reactionaries relying on the assistance of U.S. imperialism has not yet ended. In addition, U.S. imperialism is actively supporting the revival of Japanese aggressive forces. The Chinese people, in their own painful experiences, cannot but recognize that the imperialist war provocateurs are our mortal enemies, cannot but recognize that the U.S. imperialist warmongers, the leaders of the war provocateurs, are our mortal enemies, and at the same time cannot but recognize that the Soviet Union, the leader of the world anti-imperialist front and a great socialist country, is our consistent comrade-in-arms. Since its birth, the Soviet Union has sympathized with the plight of the Chinese people and has aided the Chinese people with equal brotherly friendship, among which particularly significant are the first implementation of the abolition of the unequal treaties imposed on China by Tsarist Russia, followed by practical actions to assist the National Government which had expressed opposition to imperialism, although later facts have twice proven the ingratitude of the Kuomintang reactionaries. In the war against Japanese imperialism, the Red Army annihilated the Kwantung Army, where the elite of the Japanese army was located, destroyed the puppet Manchuria, and promoted Japan's surrender. On the eve of Japan's surrender, the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship and Alliance and the agreement on Lushun and Dalian, concluded between the Soviet Union and China for the common opposition and prevention of Japanese aggression, were a serious blow to imperialist aggression in the Far East and a far-reaching guarantee for the anti-aggression interests of the Chinese people. In the Chinese people's great victorious struggle today and in the future against imperialist aggression and for developing their own people's democratic construction, the friendship of the Soviet Union is undoubtedly a major and extremely valuable factor. Mr. Sun Yat-sen's immortal will written to the Soviet Union states: "At this moment of farewell to you, I wish to express my ardent hope that the dawn will soon break, at which time the Soviet Union will welcome a strong and independent China as a good friend and ally, and the two countries will join hands in the great battle to win the freedom of the oppressed nations of the world and achieve victory." If the adventurers of the imperialist countries dare to provoke a new world war, then the Chinese people and all followers of Sun Yat-sen must undoubtedly abide by this instruction of Mr. Sun Yat-sen, and anyone who betrays this instruction will inevitably receive the same outcome as today's traitors to Sun Yat-sen.
　　But the Chinese people have also gained a most important experience in their own struggle, which is that any "powerful" imperialism can be defeated, and any imperialist military offensives and political conspiracies can be smashed and shattered. In the difficult years since Japan's surrender, the Chinese people have faced the fierce offensive of U.S. imperialism and its running dog, the Kuomintang reactionary government. The Chinese people resisted this offensive in the same way as they resisted Japanese imperialism and achieved victory. The Chinese people believe that U.S. imperialism is a paper tiger, and this truth is now more obvious in China than in many other places. The Chinese people must actively participate in the ranks of opposing the danger of a new war. All Chinese workers' organizations, women's organizations, youth organizations, cultural organizations, religious organizations, other people's organizations, cultural workers, and all progressive elements willing to fight for peace must send their representatives to the World Peace Congress. The representatives of the Chinese people must tell the world the above truth based on their own experience: As long as the peace-loving forces unite and fight without making mistakes, U.S. imperialism can certainly be defeated, and the danger of a new war created by U.S. imperialism can certainly be overcome.

### 全世界和平力量动员起来，粉碎战争挑拨者的阴谋！

　　全世界和平力量动员起来，粉碎战争挑拨者的阴谋！
    美国帝国主义政府拒绝与苏联进行和平谈判，拒绝苏联关于裁军、禁用原子武器和管制原子能的建议，积极进行关于成立北大西洋公约的活动，竭力扩大北大西洋公约的范围和美国军事基地网的范围，这一连串的行动，把新的世界战争挑拨者的面目更加暴露出来了。整个帝国主义阵线内部存在着并日益发展着严重的经济危机和政治危机，以美国帝国主义为首的国际反动派，正在幻想从战争中去寻找逃出危机的道路。因此，新的世界战争的危险是存在着，全世界一切爱好和平的人们，必须团结起来，为反对新战争的危险而夺斗。
    战争的危险是存在着的，但是，只要全世界一切爱好和平的力量团结奋斗，战争的危险是完全可以克服的。这是因为，第一，世界各国的人民都不愿意战争，希望战争的只是少数战争贩子。第二，世界各国的人民不仅仅有和平的愿望，而且有争取和平的有组织的力量，这个力量的核心就是社会主义的国家苏联，就是各个人民民主的国家，就是资本主义世界的各国共产党，各国革命的职工会和其他革命的人民团体。所有这些力量，在世界第二次大战中间和以后，都有了巨大的发展。第三，因为这样，战争挑拨者是孤立的，是外强中干的，它们不能不遇到内部的严重矛盾，不能不遇到各国资产阶级之间和各派资产阶级之间的严重矛盾。爱好和平的力量，大于挑拨战争的力量。只要世界爱好和平的力量，首先是世界工人阶级的革命力量完全警醒，不过低估计自己的力量和过高估计敌人的力量，团结一致，奋斗不懈，那么，就一定可以战胜战争挑拨者，就一定可以克服新的世界战争的危险。
    为了克服新战争的危险，全世界爱好和平的力量正在积极行动。为和平而奋斗的人类的伟大领袖斯大林，在今年一月三十日和二月二日，两次宣示苏联的坚定不移的和平政策，表示苏联愿意与美国商谈两国间的争端，并表示斯大林本人愿意与杜鲁门会商，斯大林的两次声明，受到了世界各国和平舆论的热烈赞扬。苏联外交部一月二十八日关于北大西洋公约的声明，彻底地揭发了美英侵略集团的战争计划，进一步唤起了世界和平力量的警觉。资本主义各国的共产党，站到了资末主义世界人民反战斗争的最前列。法国共产党领袖多列士在二月廿二日、二十三日、二十四日的连续声明，特别是二十四日关于如果反苏战争爆发，法国工人阶级和法国人民将要站在苏联方面，欢迎追击侵略者的苏军解放法国的声明，和意大利共产党领袖托格里亚蒂在二月二十六日所发表的类似的声明，造成了资本主义世界工人阶级和革命人民的大动员。英国共产党、美国共产党、德国统一社会党、奥国共产党、丹麦共产党、加拿大劳工进步党、墨西哥共产党、菲律宾共产党、瑞典共产党、阿根廷共产党，澳大利亚共产党、比利时共产党、荷兰共产党、巴西共产党，都先后发表声明，响应多列士和托格里亚蒂的号召。同时，在二月二十四日，世界文化工作者保卫和平大会国际联络委员会，国际民主妇女联合会，和著名的文化、科学、艺术工作者，联名发表宣言，提议在今年四月召开世界拥护和平大会。这个提议，得到了全世界工人团体、妇女团体、青年团体、文化团体、宗教团体和文化工作者的广泛拥护。爱好和平的人类，现在已经决心迎击战争挑拨者的阴谋了！
    对于世界和平力量的号召，我们中国人民毫无疑问地要努力支持。中国是一个深受帝国主义侵略和帝国主义侵略战争灾害的国家。帝国主义者不但长期地直接地用武力侵略过我们，而且长期地支援中国的反动派进行反革命的内战。直到现在，美帝国主义的武力还毫无理由地在中国的领土上驻扎并且建立军事基地。直到现在，国民党反动派依靠美帝国主义的援助而悍然发动和继续进行的反革命内战，还没有结束。此外，美帝国主义还积极扶植日本侵略势力的复活。中国人民在亲身的惨痛的经历中，不能不认定帝国主义战争挑拨者是我们的死敌，不能不认定战争挑拨者的领袖美帝国主义好战分子是我们的死敌，同时不能不认定世界反帝国主义阵线的领袖、伟大的社会主义国家苏联是我们始终不渝的战友。苏联从诞生以来，就同情中国人民的遭遇，就以平等的兄弟的友谊援助中国人民，其中特别显著的是首先实行废除帝俄时代对中国的不平等条约，随后并以实际行动援助了过表示反对帝国主义的国民政府，虽然后来的事实两次证明了国民党反动派的忘恩负义。在反对日本帝国主义的作战中，红军歼灭了日本陆军精锐所在的关东军，摧毁了伪满洲国，促成了日本的投降。在日本投降的前夜，苏联与中国为了共同反对和防止日本侵略而缔结的中苏友好同盟条约和关于旅顺大连的协定，乃是对于远东帝国主义侵略的严重打击，和对于中国人民反侵略利益的远大保证。在中国人民今天和将来的反对帝国主义侵略并发展自己的人民民主建设的伟大的胜利的斗争中，苏联的友谊毫无疑问地是一个重大的极为宝贵的因素。孙中山先生写给苏联的不朽的遗书说：“当此与你们诀别之际，我愿表示我热烈的希望，希望不久即将破晓，斯时苏联以良友及盟国而欢迎强盛独立之中国，两国在争世界被压迫民族自由之大战中，携手并进以取得胜利。”如果帝国主义国家的冒险分子居然胆敢挑动新的世界大战，那么，中国人民和一切孙中山信徒毫无疑问地必须遵守孙中山先生的这个指示，而任何背叛这个指示的人，就必然和今天的孙中山叛徒们得到同样的结果。
    但是中国人民在自己的斗争中还得到一个最重要的经验，这个经验就是任何“强大”的帝国主义都是可以战胜的，任何帝国主义的军事进攻和政治阴谋都是可以击破，可以打得粉碎的。中国人民在日本投降以来的三年多的艰难岁月中，面对着美帝国主义及其走狗国民党反动政府的凶恶进攻。中国人民用反抗日本帝国主义的同样办法抵抗了这个进攻，并且得到了胜利。中国人民认定美帝国主义是一只纸老虎，这个真理现在在中国比在旁的许多地方更明显。中国人民一定要积极参加反对新战争危险的行列。中国的一切工人团体、妇女团体、青年团体、文化团体、宗教团体、其他人民团体，文化工作者，和一切愿意为和平而奋斗的进步分子，一定要派遣自己的代表参加世界拥护和平大会。中国人民的代表们一定要把上述的真理按照自己的经验告诉全世界：只要爱好和平的力量团结奋斗，不犯错误，美帝国主义一定可以被战胜，美帝国主义所制造的新战争危险一定可以克服。　　（新华社陕北十八日电）
