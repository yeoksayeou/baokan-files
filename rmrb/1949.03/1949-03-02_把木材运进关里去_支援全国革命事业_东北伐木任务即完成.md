　　Transport Lumber into the Pass
    Support the National Revolutionary Cause
    Northeast Logging Task Nears Completion
    [Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 27th] The Northeast's logging task of 4,123,000 cubic meters has been 84% completed as of the 10th of this month, and transportation is being stepped up. This is of great significance for building a new Northeast and supporting the national revolutionary cause. Currently, the amount of lumber transported to the intermediate log yards (a "log yard" refers to the riverbank or along the forest railway line) has reached 1,760,000 cubic meters, and the amount transported to the final log yards (referring to the railway station) has reached 670,000 cubic meters, totaling 2,430,000 cubic meters, accounting for approximately 60% of the logging task. The large-scale logging work began in early November last year under the leadership of the Northeast Forestry Bureau and lasted for an entire winter. About 100,000 workers and more than 70,000 livestock were successively organized to go to the mountains for logging. Countless workshops were spread throughout the vast forest area from the Greater Khingan Range to the right bank of the Yalu River. The Forestry Bureau strengthened its guidance and contact with various places through telephone, telegraph, and communication, or sent cadres to various forest farms to help with the work. Workers in various workshops carried out labor competitions, improved technology, and accelerated logging. Since transportation work accounts for more than 80% of the entire logging operation, the local forestry bureaus, when mobilizing personnel and horses to enter the mountains for logging last year, carried out transportation preparations such as rectifying forest railways and rushing to repair ice roads. As the logging task neared completion, the slogan "Transport Lumber into the Pass" was put forward, and a heated transportation competition movement was launched. After the movement began, the forest railway employees of the Liuhe Forestry Bureau in Songjiang Province actively rushed to repair locomotives and open wagons, increasing the daily transportation of lumber from three times to four times, in order to complete the transportation task of 130,000 to 140,000 cubic meters of lumber. Some forest railways, which dared not run at night during the puppet Manchukuo era, are now running vehicles loaded with lumber around the clock. The Animal Husbandry Section of the An Dong Provincial Forestry Bureau has formulated various implementation measures to protect the health of livestock and mobilized a large number of veterinarians to enter the mountains to ensure that livestock remain healthy while transporting lumber. Other places have also adjusted their forces and improved their organizations, thereby improving transportation efficiency.

　　把木材运进关里去
    支援全国革命事业
    东北伐木任务即完成
    【新华社沈阳二十七日电】东北四百一十二万三千立方公尺的伐木任务，截至本月十日止，已完成百分之八十四，正加紧组织运输中。这对建设新东北和支援全国的革命事业具有重大意义。目前各地运至中楞（楞即材堆，中楞系指河岸或森林铁路沿线而言）的木材达一百七十六万立方公尺，运至终楞（指火车站）的达六十七万立方公尺，共计二百四十三万立方公尺，约占采伐任务的百分之六十。大规模的伐木工作，是在东北林务局领导下于去年十一月初开始，进行了整整一个冬天。各地先后组织上山采伐的工人约达十余万名，牲口七万余匹。自兴安岭至鸭绿江右岸的广大林区，满布了无数作业工场。林业局用电话、电报、通信等加强对各地的指导和联系，或派干部到各林场帮助工作。各作业场的工人进行劳动竞赛，改进技术，加速地采伐。由于运输工作占整个林木作业中百分之八十以上的工程，各地林务局在去年动员人员马匹入山采伐时，即进行整顿森林铁路赶修冰道等运输准备工作。采伐任务接近完成，便提出了“把木材运进关里去”的口号，展开热烈的搬运竞赛运动。运动开始后，松江省柳河林务局森林铁路员工积极抢修机车和敞车，使每日运输木材由三次增为四次，以完成十三至十四万立方公尺木材的运输任务。一些在伪满时代不敢夜间行车的森林铁路，现在已彻夜开行着装运木材的车辆。安柬省林务局畜产科，则制订了各种保护牲畜健康的实施办法，并动员大批兽医入山，以保证牲口在搬运木材中保持健康。其他各地也都纷纷调整力量，健全组织，因而提高了搬运效率。
