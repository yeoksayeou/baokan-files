Criticism and Suggestions

To the Editor:

　　On February 12th, three comrades from the Taiyuan Office of the First Army Corps of North China came to Xiaguan and Duancun Villages in the Fifth District of Wuxiang County to buy eight pigs, totaling 86,700 yuan (new currency). According to regulations, a tax of 668 yuan should be paid, with the buyer and seller each paying half. However, the three comrades claimed that there was no explicit provision in the regulations stating that the army should pay taxes when buying livestock. They also said that tax collection was only prevalent in the Taihang area and not uniformly stipulated by the North China People's Government, so they refused to pay the tax. Despite repeated explanations, they insisted on not paying. On the morning of February 13th, they drove the pigs away without paying the tax or obtaining a receipt, and they also refused to pay the seller's share of the tax. Such intentional tax evasion has had a significant impact on tax collection work. We hope that the relevant leadership will investigate the above situation and educate the army, especially procurement personnel, to facilitate future work.

### 军队买牲畜也应纳税

专栏：批评与建议

　　军队买牲畜也应纳税编辑同志：
    在二月十二日华北第一兵团住太谷办事处的三个同志，来我武乡五区下关、段村两村买猪八口，共值价额八万六千七百元（新币），应该交纳税额六百六十八元，本来法令上明文规定：牲畜买卖由买卖主双方各出一半，但该三同志说法令上没有明文规定军队买牲畜也出税，又说税收是太行区通行，不是华北人民政府统一规定，而不出税。再三解释也不行，经过我县崔副县长给他再次说明，该三同志坚持不出。在二月十三日早晨赶上猪走了，未出税也未拉票，并且把卖主的税额他们也承担起不交。这样有意的漏税，给了税收工作一个很大影响。希望该领导机关除追究上述情况外，并给军队特别是采买人员以教育，以便利今后工作。
