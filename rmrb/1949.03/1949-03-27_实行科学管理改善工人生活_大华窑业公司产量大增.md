Implementing Scientific Management Improves Workers' Lives
    Dahua Kiln Company Sees Significant Increase in Production
    [This newspaper] The privately-owned Ping City Dahua Kiln Company Limited recently established a Factory Affairs Management Committee and implemented scientific management, improving workers' lives. As a result, workers' enthusiasm for production has increased, and output has risen. In the year and nine months of last year, a total of twenty kilns of porcelain were produced (30,000 pieces per kiln). Within a month of resuming work, five kilns were produced, greatly exceeding the pre-liberation level. The color and quality of the finished products are also better than before. The Factory Affairs Management Committee of the factory is composed of the manager, one engineer, and three staff members as ex-officio members. In addition, six foremen, four worker representatives, and two general workers are elected as members. It is divided into seven groups: purchasing, auditing, sales, technology, learning, welfare, and supervision. They are responsible for purchasing raw materials, selling finished products, improving technology, supervising accounts, raising workers' knowledge levels, and improving workers' lives. Since the resumption of work, the factory has purchased a large amount of raw materials such as silica, pottery clay, feldspar, and firebricks from Tangshan, and built more than 20 factory buildings. Technicians are also drawing blueprints to manufacture pulverizers. After negotiation, in addition to providing food and lodging, foremen receive 190 catties of millet per month; technicians are divided into three grades: 150 catties, 130 catties, and 120 catties; ordinary workers are divided into three grades: 100 catties, 90 catties, and 70 catties; general workers receive 90 catties; and child laborers receive 60 catties per person. Technicians who now earn 150 catties only earned 105 catties before liberation, an increase of about 40%. Meals are millet noodles three times a day, with a serving of fine grains once a week, and four ounces of meat per person. The working hours are ten hours a day, with two days off per month.
