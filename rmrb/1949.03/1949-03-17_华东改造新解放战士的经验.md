Experiences in Transforming Newly Liberated Soldiers in East China
    How to transform and improve newly liberated soldiers ideologically and in terms of military skills, so that they can quickly become strong people's fighters – this is a major issue in the current military construction of the People's Liberation Army. The main experiences gained by the East China Liberation Army in this regard are as follows:
    (1) Unite newly liberated soldiers through the Party members, cadres, and veteran soldiers in the company, starting from their daily lives and emotions. Under the influence of the exemplary actions of Zhao Jingshui, the deputy squad leader of the Eighth Squad of the Sixth Company of a certain regiment, the new and old comrades of the entire squad were united as one. Once, during a two-day march, Deputy Squad Leader Zhao helped Qu Ruiwu, a newly liberated soldier, carry his rifle and backpack all the way, and immediately dried his wet clothes when they arrived at the campsite. Qu Ruiwu said with emotion: "The squad leader treats me like a real brother, and I will work hard in the future." When the squad then built fortifications after a continuous march, Guo Xianglin, a newly liberated soldier, was unwilling to work and lay down to sleep. Deputy Squad Leader Zhao silently picked up a shovel and dug for him under the moonlight. When Guo Xianglin woke up and saw this, he felt very uneasy and immediately snatched the shovel to dig himself. During the Li Lou battle, Deputy Squad Leader Zhao gave his anti-artillery cave to Zhu Huangchun, a newly liberated soldier who had just joined the squad, and delivered food and water to him, while also introducing him to the internal situation of the People's Liberation Army. Zhu Huangchun was greatly moved and firmly stated: he will also care for and love new comrades in the future. The veteran soldiers of the squad also cared for and took care of the newly liberated soldiers in every way. For example, when daily necessities were distributed, the veteran soldiers let the newly liberated soldiers pick first. When the lodging was small, the veteran soldiers would automatically sleep outside. This spirit of unity and friendship, with Zhao Jingshui as its core, has become the fine tradition of the squad.
    (2) After initially establishing an emotional relationship with newly liberated soldiers, individual ideological assistance should be carried out to improve the political awareness of newly liberated soldiers. The Seventh Squad Leader of a machine gun company in a certain unit used examples and comparisons to educate newly liberated soldiers. Once, when a group of civilians transported bullets and grain to the front, passing by the Seventh Squad's station, the Seventh Squad Leader asked Mo Bochun, a newly liberated soldier: "In the past, when you were on the Kuomintang side, did you ever see civilians helping?" Mo replied: "The Kuomintang side had ghosts helping them. Wherever they went, the civilians all ran away." The squad leader continued: "Because our troops are fighting for the people, the people voluntarily support the front line. With the help of the people, we win everywhere." The Seventh Squad Leader also talked about the relationship between officers and soldiers in the Liberation Army, starting with the fact that the officers and soldiers of the Liberation Army received the same allowances, and explained the current situation from the Liberation Army's victory when he saw many prisoners of war. After listening, Mo Bochun said to the Seventh Squad Leader: "I am determined to follow the Liberation Army to the end." When Sui Jingming, the deputy squad leader of the Ninth Squad of the First Company of a certain regiment, was studying combat actions with Tan Changyu, a newly liberated soldier, using a sand table in an air-raid shelter, Tan said to Sui: "Why do we need to study this? We just do whatever the officers tell us to do." Sui immediately explained to him: "This is the glorious democratic tradition of our people's army. The superiors care for us and ask everyone how to fight to win and shed less blood." Tan listened and said: "It's completely different in the Kuomintang." Sui then used this to conduct a comparative education of the different styles of the two armies for Tan. Whether in the station, during the march or in combat, cadres and veteran soldiers actively used the gaps to conduct individual conversations with newly liberated soldiers, with great results. At the same time, the use of activists among the newly liberated soldiers to provide ideological assistance to other newly liberated soldiers also played a certain role. For example, Zhang Chengqian, a newly liberated soldier of the Eighth Squad of a certain regiment, said to a newly liberated soldier who had just been liberated: "In the past, when we were on the Kuomintang side, we did whatever the squad leader said. It's different here. Everything must be done consciously and automatically." After the new soldier heard him say this, he did all duties very automatically.
    (3) After newly liberated soldiers have initially improved their political awareness through individual ideological assistance, they should then be educated about grievances to make them clearly establish the basic concept of "who to be a soldier for and who to fight for." Due to the continuous combat environment, many units adopted small-scale front-line grievance meetings at the squad level (to make it easier for newly liberated soldiers to accept, they were also called "introduction meetings" or "frank talks"). At the meeting, newly liberated soldiers were encouraged to speak out about their grievances through methods such as questioning, casual conversation, and mutual introduction of experiences. For example, ask the new soldiers: "Where are you from? How many people are in your family, how much land do you have? How was your life? How did you become a Kuomintang soldier? Did the Kuomintang officers treat you well?" At the frank talk meeting of the Seventh Squad of the First Company of a certain unit, soldier Zhang Deyuan first narrated his past suffering, such as how his father, who was over sixty years old, was driven out by the landlord three times because he could not do heavy work, and how his mother attempted suicide three times because she had nothing to eat. He then talked about how land reform was carried out in the liberated areas, and his family was given land and houses, and he voluntarily joined the army. After Zhang Deyuan introduced himself, many newly liberated soldiers then spoke out about the various sufferings they had suffered from the Kuomintang army, the old regime, and the feudal landlords. After the meeting, the newly liberated soldiers unanimously believed that only by relying on the leadership of the Communist Party and relying on the Liberation Army to win battles could they turn over. The artillery company of a certain unit held a small-scale grievance meeting during the time of rest taken in turns when they were building fortifications, and the veteran soldiers connected with their past hardships in the conversation of family affairs to encourage the newly liberated soldiers to speak out their grievances. The characteristic of this form of grievance, such as "introduction meetings", is to complete the general guidance of grievance and the speaking out of grievance within a short period of time, while at the same time initially tracing the root causes of suffering. The leading organs of each unit immediately used the grievance materials of each squad as examples to carry out education on "who to be a soldier for and who to fight for," and then conducted in-depth casual talks in each squad, setting off the revenge emotions of the newly liberated soldiers. For example, after the Second Company of a certain regiment conducted grievance meetings, Wang Zhizhong, a newly liberated soldier of the Fourth Squad, said: "When I was first liberated, I only thought about home. After speaking out my grievances, I don't want to anymore. If everyone wants to go home, who will overthrow the Kuomintang reactionaries and avenge the poor?" After speaking out their grievances, many newly liberated soldiers voluntarily told the organization their true names and positions in the Kuomintang army that they had concealed in the past.
    (4) After newly liberated soldiers have high revenge fighting emotions, they should be actively helped to learn and improve military skills, in order to further consolidate their fighting emotions and confidence. For example, a certain regiment established a short-term demolition training class, and in three days, thirty-seven newly liberated soldiers learned demolition. Xiao Shijun, a newly liberated soldier of the Seventh Squad of the Third Company of a certain regiment, automatically requested to participate in demolition learning after speaking out his grievances. He said: "When I was on the Kuomintang side, I was not fighting for myself. I didn't want to learn anything. Now I am fighting for myself, so I want to quickly learn the skills of revenge, defeat the Kuomintang reactionaries, so that everyone will no longer suffer from it." In military learning, a certain unit also enabled some newly liberated soldiers with certain military skills to teach their skills to other comrades, and carried out military mutual assistance. When newly liberated soldiers even participated in the war, they were taught while fighting. For example, the Sixth Company of a certain regiment appropriately equipped the composition of new and old soldiers before each battle, and put forward the slogan "the battlefield is the classroom." During the Guo Lou defense battle, the deputy platoon leader of the first platoon explained to Chen Futai, a newly liberated soldier of the Third Squad, how to fight enemy tanks and use explosives, and Yan Shiqi, a veteran soldier of the Third Platoon of the Fourth Company, explained the use of incendiary bombs to the newly liberated soldiers. Many newly liberated soldiers quickly learned.
    (5) When newly liberated soldiers gradually improve ideologically and in terms of military skills, the company cadres encourage and commend them, and when they have better performance, they help them evaluate their merits. This greatly improved the enthusiasm of the newly liberated soldiers. (Xinhua News Agency)

　　华东改造新解放战士的经验
    如何从思想上、军事技术上改造与提高新解放战士，使他们迅速成为一个坚强的人民战士——这是人民解放军当前军事建设中的重大课题。华东解放军在这方面所获得的主要经验如下：
    （一）通过连队中的党员、干部、老战士，从生活上、感情上团结新解放战士。某团六连八班在副班长赵景水的模范行动影响下，全班新老同志团结无间。有一次，该班在两天行军，赵副班长一路上帮助新解放战士曲瑞五背枪和背包，到了宿营地又立刻替他烤湿衣服。曲瑞五感动地说：“班长待我象亲兄弟，我以后再好好干。”当该班于连续行军后接着又筑工事时，新解放战士郭相林不愿干，倒下来就睡觉，赵副班长一声不响地拿起铁铲在月光下代替他挖。郭相林醒来一看，心里十分不安，马上夺过铁铲自己挖了。在李楼作战时，赵副班长把自己的防炮洞让给才编进班里来的新解放战士朱黄春，又把饭水送到他手里，并向他介绍了解放军的内部情形。朱黄春大受感动，坚决表示：以后也要关心和爱护新同志。该班老战士亦处处关心与照顾新解放战士。如发日用品时，老战士让新解放战士先拣。宿营遇到房子小时，老战士便自动睡在屋外。以赵景水为核心的这种团结友爱的精神，已成为该班的优良作风。
    （二）当对新解放战士初步建立了感情关系之后，就应展开个别的思想互助，提高新解放战士的政治认识。某部机枪连七班长以实例对比教育新解放战士。有一次一群民工往前方运送子弹、粮食，经过七班的驻地时，七班长就向新解放战士莫博春问道：“你过去在国民党那边看到有没有老百姓帮忙？”莫答：“国民党那边有鬼帮忙，他们走到哪里，哪里老百姓都跑光了。”班长接着说：“因为我们部队是为老百姓打仗的，老百姓都自愿支援前线。我们有了老百姓帮助，所以到处打胜仗。”七班长还在发津贴时从解放军官兵发一样的津贴说起，向莫讲解解放军的官兵关系，在看到许多俘虏时从解放军打胜仗说起讲解了目前形势。莫博春听后，对七班长说：“我决心跟着解放军干到底。”某团一连九班副班长隋京明在防空洞里与新解放战士谭长玉摆沙盘研究战斗动作时，谭向隋说：“这怎么还用研究？官长叫怎么打就怎么打。”隋即向他解释说：“这是咱们人民军队民主的光荣传统。上级爱护咱，叫大家怎办法打胜仗，而又少流血。”谭听了说：“国民党那里就完全两样。”隋便以此向谭进行了两种军队的不同作风的对比教育。不论在驻地、行军或作战中，干部与老战士积极利用空隙与新解放战士进行个别谈话，收效甚大。同时，通过新解放战士中的积极分子，对其他新解放战士进行思想互助，也曾起了一定作用。如某团八班新解放战士张成千对刚被解放的新解放战士说：“过去我们在国民党那边干，班长说一点我们干一点，这里就不同了，什么事情就要自觉自动。”新战士听他说后，以后对一切勤务都很自动地做。
    （三）新解放战士经过个别思想互助，初步提高了政治认识后，这时再对他们进行诉苦教育，使他们明确树立“为谁当兵、为谁打仗”的基本观念。由于连续作战的环境，许多单位采取了以班为单位的小型火线诉苦会（为使新解放战士容易接受，或称“介绍会”或“恳谈会”）。在会上以询问、漫谈、互相介绍经历等方法启发新解放战士诉苦。如问新战士：“你是哪里人？家有多少人口、田地？生活过的怎么样？怎样当了国民党军？国民党军当官的对你好吗？”某部一连七班的恳谈会上，参军战士张德元首先叙述过去自己六十多岁的父亲因不能大力干活，被地主赶出三次，母亲因没有饭吃，三次服毒自杀未成等痛苦后，又谈到解放区进行土地改革，他家分到了土地、房子，他是自动参军的。当张德元自我介绍后，许多新解放战士接着就纷纷诉苦，说出他们过去所受国民党军队、旧政权及封建地主的压迫剥削的各种痛苦。会后，新解放战士一致认为，受苦的人只有依靠共产党的领导、依靠解放军打胜仗，才能翻身。某部炮兵连在紧张筑工事时乘轮流休息的时间举行小型诉苦会，老战士从谈家常中连系到自己的过去苦处，启发新解放战士诉苦。这种以“介绍会”等形式诉苦的特点，即是将一般引苦、诉苦在一个短促的时间内完成，同时又初步地追寻痛苦的根源。各部领导机关是时即以各班诉苦材料为实例，进行了“为谁当兵、为谁打仗”的教育，然后再在各班深入漫谈，掀起了新解放战士的复仇情绪。如某团二连进行诉苦后，四班新解放战士王志忠说：“我才解放时光想家，诉苦后不想了。如果大家都想回家，叫谁去打倒国民党反动派，为穷人报仇？”许多新解放战士诉苦后，自动向组织上说出过去隐瞒的真实姓名和在国民党军中的职务。
    （四）当新解放战士有了高涨的复仇战斗情绪后，就应积极地帮助他们学习提高军事技术，以便进一步巩固他们的战斗情绪与信心。如某团成立了短期爆破训练班，在三天中就有三十七个新解放战士学会了爆破。某团三连七班新解放战士萧世俊经过诉苦后，自动要求参加爆破学习，他说：“我在国民党那边不是为自己打仗，我什么都不想学，现在是为了自己打仗，所以我想赶快学会报仇的本领，打垮国民党反动派，好叫大家再不受它的罪。”某部在军事学习中，又使一部份在军事技术上有某些特长的新解放战士，将其技术教给其他同志，开展军事互助。当新解放战士直至参战的时候，又对他们进行边打边教，如某团六连在每次战斗前适当配备了新老战士成份，提出“战场就是课堂”的口号。某团八连在郭楼守备战中，一排副排长即向三班新解放战士陈富泰讲解怎样打敌人坦克及使用炸药的办法，四连三排老战士燕士启向新解放战士讲解燃烧弹的用法。许多新解放战士很快便学会了。
    （五）当新解放战士在思想上及军事技术上逐渐进步的时候，连队干部便鼓励与表扬他们，而当他们有较好的表现时，又替他们评功。这样就大大地提高了新解放战士的积极性。　　　　（新华社）
