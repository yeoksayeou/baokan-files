    Before the play, sing a freed serf ditty, perform the Yangko dance, and after singing, form a circle.
    Young Girl: (Jumps to the center, speaking in rapid rhythm) Folks, listen to me, let me tell you about smallpox. It started spreading last July, sweeping through the second district in just a few days. It hasn't stopped even now, causing real suffering to the people, causing real suffering to the people.
    Old Woman: (Pockmarked face towards the audience) Catching smallpox leaves pockmarks, delays production, and costs money. Blindness brings disaster, patients suffer and are in danger, patients suffer and are in danger.
    Woman: Folks, look at this, how terrible it is to get smallpox! Suffering, and filth, everyone should hurry to prevent it, everyone should hurry to prevent it.
    Old Man: Nanwanglou (in the second district of Pingshan County), a big village, has a total of eighty-three cases of smallpox. People are afraid when they hear it. But don't be afraid! Our government has a way, specially organizing an anti-epidemic team to come to the villages to help our folks prevent smallpox. Vaccinating and treating illnesses, ensuring the health of the people. Folks, look, how much the People's Government cares for us! (Everyone says in unison) Right! Right! The People's Government cares for us so much.
    Village Cadre's Speech: (Colloquial) Folks, I heard that the North China People's Government has sent an anti-epidemic treatment team. They can cure any disease with their needles, women's and children's diseases, toothaches, especially vaccination, which is free of charge.
    Doctor: Old aunt, old uncle, let me tell you about smallpox prevention. There is a way to prevent smallpox, only if everyone gets vaccinated. Vaccination is free, men, women, young and old should all get vaccinated, ensuring the safety of the people's lives.
    Everyone says in unison: Good, let's get vaccinated! (End)
