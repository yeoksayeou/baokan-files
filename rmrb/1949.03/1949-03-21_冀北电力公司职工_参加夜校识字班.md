　　Employees of Jibei Electric Power Company
    Participate in Night School Literacy Classes
    [This Newspaper Reports] The Jibei Electric Power Company's worker literacy class began on the 18th. Among the twenty-odd workers participating were fifty-three-year-old veteran craftsman Li Yintang and forty-four-year-old carpenter Pu Zhenzhou. They were both very excited and studying diligently. The establishment of the literacy class was initiated by carpenter Wang Jiaoli, who joined with other illiterate workers to find the trade union preparatory committee and request the opening of a literacy class. With the enthusiastic help of the trade union preparatory committee, it was quickly formed. It was stipulated that classes would be held during the noon break on Tuesdays and Fridays to learn to read. In addition, the company's employee night school is scheduled to open on the 21st. As of the 18th, seventy-seven people had already registered, most of whom are technicians.
