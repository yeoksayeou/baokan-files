Xinhua News Agency, Central Plains, 8th: The Central Plains Liberated Area's western Henan and Henan-Anhui-Jiangsu regions have seen over 22,500 local people's armed forces promoted to main force units. These upgraded local troops have mostly been tested in long periods of struggle. They eliminated local bandits, coordinated with the field army in battles in eastern Henan, Suiqi, and the Huaihai Campaign, and grew stronger in victorious battles. The local armed forces of Xuefeng (Yongcheng), Xiaoxian, and Xiayi and other twelve counties in the Henan-Anhui-Jiangsu Third Military Sub-district, in nearly a year and a half of arduous struggle, annihilated over 20,000 Kuomintang bandit troops and local bandits, while their own forces grew more than threefold. When the upgraded local armed forces went to designated locations for assembly, the people everywhere enthusiastically saw them off. The upgraded troops of the western Henan Third Military Sub-district set off on the 25th of last month, and along the way, various towns and villages automatically set up celebration tables on the streets to see them off, with women holding large bunches of red flowers to pin on the soldiers.

　　中原地武久经斗争锻炼
    二万余人荣升主力
    【新华社中原八日电】中原解放区豫西、豫皖苏二万二千五百余名地方人民武装荣升主力部队。这些升级的地方部队大多经过长时期的斗争中的考验，他们肃清了地方上的土匪，配合野战军转战于豫东、睢＠和淮海战场，并在胜利战斗中发展壮大了自己。豫皖苏三分区雪枫（永城）、萧县、夏邑等十二县的地方武装在近一年半的艰苦斗争，歼灭国民党匪军和地方土匪两万余人，自身也壮大到三倍以上。当升级的地方武装开往指定地点集中时，各地人民热烈地欢送。豫西三分区升级部队，于上月二十五日出发，沿途各城镇乡村自动在街头摆设贺桌欢送，妇女们拿着大串红花，插在战士的身上。
