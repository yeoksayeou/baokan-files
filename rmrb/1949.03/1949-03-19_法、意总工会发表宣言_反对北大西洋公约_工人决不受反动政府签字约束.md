Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 18th. According to a dispatch from Diantong News Agency: The General Confederation of Labor of France and Italy issued declarations on the 16th, the day after the conclusion of the draft North Atlantic Treaty negotiations in Washington, opposing the Atlantic Treaty, and calling on the working classes and the broad masses of people of their respective countries to unite to defend peace. The declaration of the Italian General Confederation of Labor stated: "The Atlantic Treaty—a military alliance representing an even more terrible threat of new war—is about to be imposed on our country." Because of Italy's geographical location, it will become the first victim of this new war. Italy is about to fall into this danger, not out of the need to safeguard national interests, but to serve the interests of imperialism and foreign countries. The declaration calls on all Italians to unite to defend peace. The French General Confederation of Labor declared that the French working class will never be bound by the French government's signature on the North Atlantic Treaty. The General Confederation of Labor called on all members to support the preparatory work for the World Peace Congress, and called for mass actions and mass protests against the government's imminent signing of the war and aggression treaty.

　　法、意总工会发表宣言
  　反对北大西洋公约
    工人决不受反动政府签字约束
    【新华社陕北十八日电】据电通社消息：法国和意大利的总工会，在十六日，即华盛顿结束大西洋公约草案谈判的次日，分别发表宣言反对大西洋公约，并号召各该国工人阶级和广大人民团结起来保卫和平。意大利总工会的宣言称：“大西洋公约——一个代表更可怕的新战争威胁的军事联盟，即将强加于我国。”因为意大利的地理位置，它将成为这一新战争的第一个牺牲品。意大利即将陷入这一危险，不是出于维护民族利益的需要，而是为了服务于帝国主义和外国的利益。宣言号召一切意大利人团结起来保卫和平。法国总工会宣称，法国工人阶级决不受法政府在北大西洋公约上签字的约束。该总工会号召所有会员支持世界和平大会的筹备工作，号召进行反对政府即将签字的战争与侵略公约的群众行动和群众抗议。
