Xinhua News Agency, Beiping, March 25th: The 574 officers and men of the mutinied cruiser "Chongqing" telegraphed Chairman Mao of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and Commander-in-Chief Zhu of the Chinese People's Liberation Army after arriving in Huludao. The telegram reads as follows:

Respected Leader of the Chinese People, Chairman Mao, Commander-in-Chief Zhu of the Chinese People's Liberation Army:

As all 574 officers and men of our "Chongqing" safely arrive at a liberated area port, please accept our most sincere and lofty respect.

In the anti-Chinese people's civil war colluded by the US and Chiang, the Chinese Navy has unfortunately been forced to serve as an accomplice. However, in the nearly three years of war, the Kuomintang army has almost disappeared, and uprisings in the air force are emerging one after another. Furthermore, within the navy, which the war criminal Gui Yongqing regards as personal property, the vast number of naval youth can no longer be deceived and anesthetized by him. Coupled with Chiang Kai-shek's reactionary measures in politics and economics, which have entered a final total collapse beyond repair, any assistance from American and British imperialism cannot bring it back to life. The victory of the national people's liberation struggle can be expected in days. In view of the general trend and the will of the people, all officers and men of the "Chongqing," unwilling to continue to help the tyrant, are willing to atone for their sins and serve the people. Therefore, on February 25th, in the heartland of the Kuomintang, outside the Wusongkou port, they resolutely raised the flag of naval uprising, sailed north into the liberated area port, and joined the Chinese People's Liberation Army. From now on, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and the direct leadership of the military and political leaders of the Northeast Liberated Area, we vow to implement Chairman Mao's Eight Peace Proposals, fight to completely destroy the US-Chiang collusion's rule over the Chinese people, complete the great cause of national people's liberation, thoroughly transform ourselves, eradicate all ideological styles that are detrimental to the people's cause, and build a strong new Chinese People's Navy. We believe that the route already taken by our "Chongqing" will be followed by hundreds of Kuomintang naval vessels and thousands of ambitious naval youth, who will unite around you—the bright light illuminating the territorial waters, territories, and airspace of the new China.

(Signed) Deng Zhaoxiang, Captain of the "Chongqing," Naval Colonel, leading all 574 officers and men of the "Chongqing," bowing respectfully.

March 5th

　　邓兆祥舰长率全体官兵
    致电毛主席朱总司令
  　愿为建设人民海军服务到底
    【新华社北平二十五日电】起义的巡洋舰重庆号官兵五百七十四名，曾于驶抵葫芦岛后，致电中共中央毛主席、中国人民解放军朱总司令。电文如下：
    敬爱的中国人民领袖毛主席，中国人民解放军朱总司令：
    当我们重庆号五百七十四名官兵全体平安抵达解放区港口之际，请你们接受我们最诚挚的崇高的敬意。
    在美蒋勾结的反中国人民内战中，几年的中国海军，亦不幸被迫作为帮凶工具。但战争近三年来，国民党陆军消失殆尽，空军起义风起云涌，而在战犯桂永清据为私人财产的海军内部广大海军青年亦已不能再受其欺骗麻醉。复加蒋介石在政治、经济各方面的反动措施，已进入最后总崩溃而不可收拾，美英帝国主义的任何援助，也决不能使之起死回生。全国人民解放斗争的胜利，计日可待。鉴于大势所趋，人心所向，重庆号全体官兵，不甘再助纣为虐咸愿秉诚赎罪，报效人民，乃于二月二十五日在国民党腹心地区内吴淞口外，毅然首举海军义旗，北驶开入解放区港口，参加中国人民解放军。今后誓当在中国共产党领导之下，东北解放区军政首长直接领导之下，贯彻毛主席八项和平主张，为彻底摧毁美蒋勾的对中国人民的统治，完成全国人民解放大业而奋斗，为彻底改造自己，根除一切不利于人民事业的思想作风，建立一支强大的新中国人民海军而奋斗。相信我们重庆号已走过的航路，数百艘国民党海军舰艇，万千有志的海军青年，必将跟踪而来，团结在您们——普照着新中国领海领土领空的明灯周围。
    重庆号舰长海军上校邓兆祥率重庆号全体官兵五百七十四名同叩。
    　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　三月五日
