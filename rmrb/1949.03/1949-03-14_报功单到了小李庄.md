The Citation of Merit Arrives at Little Li Village
Wang Xiang

Little Li Village, in the second district of Yuncheng County, Jilu-Yu, is a small and poor village with only twenty-five households. Recently, however, a major event that shook the entire district occurred in this small village. In January of this year, a letter suddenly arrived from the distant northeast. It turned out that Li Chang'an, who had gone to the northeast five years ago to work in the coal mines, had joined the Northeast People's Liberation Army and earned a First Class Merit. The big red Citation of Merit was sent back to his hometown. Immediately, the news spread quickly throughout the village. The district government stipulated that on February 9th, congratulations would be offered to Comrade Li's family.

On that day, very early in the morning, all the people in the village got up. Grandpa Li, with a beaming smile, made all the preparations. He borrowed a large gown and a top hat from a neighbor, dressing himself neatly. The village cadres found a band of musicians and drummers, and cleaned up a tidy courtyard and a large three-room hall. Six elderly seniors also dressed in new clothes, preparing to welcome guests from other villages to celebrate the merit. They talked about how much suffering their poor ancestors had endured and how much anger they had suffered from the landlords. But now, their own children had actually made great contributions. As they talked and laughed, they felt this was the supreme glory of their village. All the adults and children in the village were also waiting to participate in this exciting scene. On the wall on the west side of the village, a dazzling red slogan had already been posted: "Small Village, Few People, But No Shortage of Wisdom!" After a while, more than two hundred people from Han Hai Village, carrying a large plaque and a band of musicians, came straight to Little Li Village from the north field. Immediately, the village's loudspeakers played music in the front, followed by all the villagers, young and old, welcoming them at the village entrance. At this time, more than three hundred people from the front and rear Tang buildings also arrived, as did those from Xu Village. Then the ceremony of congratulating the merit began. Villagers from village after village crowded into the courtyard, bowing to Comrade Chang'an's father and the Citation of Merit. Grandpa Li and the six elderly seniors respectfully returned the greetings one by one. Everyone was so serious, yet their faces were full of joy. In the square with more than six hundred people, District Political Commissar Xing Zhan loudly explained to everyone that the liberation of Tianjin and Beijing was achieved by the Northeast People's Liberation Army, who made great contributions in coordination with the North China People's Liberation Army. In the future, we should take good care of the families of the soldiers. From then on, two big operas were performed, and clusters of people came and went, watching. The whole Little Li Village was in jubilation. After the meeting, Grandpa Li asked someone to write a letter, telling his son—Chang'an—all of this, and instructing him to work hard and fight all the way to the south of the Yangtze River to liberate all of China!

　　报功单到了小李庄
    王相
    冀鲁豫郓城县第二区小李庄是一个又小又穷的村子，全庄只有二十五户人家，这个小村子，最近却发生了轰动全小区的大事。今年一月间，忽然从遥远的关外寄来了一封书信，原来是五年前去关外挖煤窑的李长安参加了东北解放军，并且立了一等功，大红的报功单寄回了家乡。马上这个消息飞快的传遍了全村。区政府规定于二月九日给李同志的家属贺功。
    这天，天还很早的时候，全村的人们便都起来了，李大爷满面笑容地做着一切准备，在邻居家借了一个大衫子和一顶礼帽，打扮得整整齐齐；村干部给找好了一班子吹鼓手，打扫了一个干净的院子和一座三间的大堂屋。六个长辈的老人，也穿了一身新，准备着迎接外庄来贺功的客人。他们谈到了穷祖先受了多少罪，吃过多少地主们的气，但如今呢，自己的孩子居然立了大功，他们说着笑着，觉得这是自己庄上无上的光荣。全村里的大人小孩，也都在等待着参加这个兴奋的场面。村西头的墙上早已贴上了“庄小、人少、智不少”的恍眼红的标语。一会，韩海村的二百多群众，抬着一面大匾，带着一班子鼓乐，从北地里直向小李庄奔来。马上全村喇叭便在前边吹着，后边紧跟着全村的老小欢迎到村头。这时前后唐楼的三百多群众也带来了，徐庄的也来了。便开始了贺功的仪式，一村村的群众拥进院里，向长安同志的父亲及报功单行鞠躬礼。李大爷和那六个长辈老人，一一恭敬的给以还礼。每个人都是那样的严肃，却又是喜容盈面。在六百多人的广场上，区政委邢展同志响亮地向大家说明了平津的解放，就是劳苦功高的东北解放军配合华北解放军打下来的，今后我们应好好的照顾家属。自此两台大戏吹唱起来，一簇簇的人群在来来往往的观看着，整个的小李庄欢腾起来。会后，李大爷找人写了封信，把这一切情形都写给了儿子——长安，并且嘱咐他要好好的干，一直打到江南去，解放全中国！
