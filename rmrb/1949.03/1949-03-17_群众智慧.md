　　Mass Wisdom
    Peng Cheng, Xiu Ya
    It was past midnight, and Regiment Commander Zhang was still writing in his office. He had forgotten the day's fatigue, excitedly pondering an important issue: how to greatly promote the training methods devised by soldiers Kong Guihua and Chen Lunde throughout the entire regiment, ensuring that every company adopted them.

    The story is as follows: The day before yesterday, after the regiment held a training mobilization meeting, Kong Guihua and Chen Lunde couldn't fall asleep until late at night. Kong Guihua, wide awake, asked Chen Lunde, "Old Chen, what's on your mind?"

    "What do you think! The higher-ups have called on us to use our brains and come up with ideas. We have to think of a way!"

    The two men's minds met, and they discussed together, from the shortcomings of fighting in ×× town to the experience of the last training; from the bitter days of serving in the old army to the democratic life after being liberated from Wazi Street. Kong said to Chen: "I've been thinking, Wang Xiaohu doesn't practice shooting properly usually, and he panics on the battlefield, shooting randomly. He doesn't practice his movements properly usually, and he can't spread out during battle, leading to heavy casualties. I think to train well, we must put in hard work, the methods must be right, and tactical movements must be well coordinated with explosions, grenade throwing, and bayonet charges; if the enemy's fortifications change, we have to study them. For example, we had problems in our last operation, and the casualties were high. Now, when we train, we must study the battles we've fought. Training well is really useful, but how to train well? That requires promoting criticism..."

    Chen Lunde repeatedly said, "Right, right, I agree with your opinion." The next day, they reported it to the company, which immediately passed it on to the battalion headquarters. After the cadres studied it, they believed that what Kong and Chen had proposed could be summarized as "Four Combinations": First, combining field exercises with actual combat; second, combining tactics with techniques; third, combining the study of the enemy with improving ourselves; and fourth, combining criticism with learning.

    After hearing the battalion's report, Regiment Commander Zhang was very moved. He returned to the regiment headquarters and called each battalion, asking the battalion and company cadres and staff officers to hold a meeting. The meeting discussed how to implement the "Four Combinations" training method in each company. Everyone proposed many specific methods. Finally, it was decided that each battalion would first take charge of one company, providing specific assistance to gain some experience, and then promote it universally.

    The regiment's training was in full swing. Regarding the issue of how logistical personnel could find time for necessary training, some cadres felt that there was no way. One day, Regiment Commander Zhang went to the Ninth Company and saw aiming frames placed at the entrance of the kitchen, with people steaming buns and boiling water aiming in an orderly manner. Later, he went to the Fourth Company and saw a painting on the wall newspaper drawn by a soldier called "Fourth Company Kitchen Crew Cooking and Practicing Martial Arts at the Same Time." They divided the work of cooking, prepared the next day's work at night, and then took time to train the next day, so he promoted this method everywhere. The next day he went to the Ninth Company again, and he saw the company commander guiding everyone in aiming. He thought: "That's right! The training of logistical personnel must also have specialized guidance to be effective." Based on these inspirations from the masses, he came up with specific ways to do a good job in the training of logistical personnel.

    Once, because the comrades didn't put in hard work and took shortcuts when practicing martial arts, soldier Yang Zhongsheng invented an inspection method to specifically check whether shooting actions were accurate. Regiment Commander Zhang learned about it and immediately praised it, naming it "Yang Zhongsheng Inspection Method." Soon, it was adopted by all battalions, which greatly improved shooting skills.

    The wisdom of the masses is constantly concentrated to the leaders. Regiment Commander Zhang consciously and systematically promoted these advantages and methods, and the training gained no small harvest. In the shooting test, 98% of the people hit the target, and the number of bullets in the target was above 90%, with an average score of over fourteen rings. The soldiers used their own wisdom to create "Offense and Defense Committees" to study the enemy and improve themselves, learning while fighting, realizing the four combinations.

    From these practical experiences, Regiment Commander Zhang gained a truth: "The masses possess infinite wisdom. Concentrating the wisdom of the masses and guiding the masses is a leader's leadership art and the method of following the mass line. If we lack sensitivity to new things, if we do not learn from the masses and lack a class sense of responsibility, then we will always be trapped in the old routine and unable to jump out."

　　群众智慧
    鹏程　修亚
    天过半夜了，张团长还在办公室里写东西，他忘记了一天的疲劳，兴奋地在思索着一个重要问题，就是把战士孔贵华和陈伦德想出来的练兵办法，怎样在全团里大大提倡一番，让每个连队都这样做起来。
    事情是这样的：前天团里开了练兵动员会以后，孔贵华和陈伦德直到半夜还睡不着，孔贵华睁着眼睛问陈伦德：“老陈，你想什么心思？”
    “想什么！上级号召咱们人人用脑筋，个个想办法，咱也得想个办法呀！”
    俩人碰对了心思，就扯在一起，从打××镇的缺点谈到上次练兵的经验；从过去干旧军队的辛酸日子说到从瓦子街被解放后的民主生活。孔对陈说：“我想了一想，王小虎平时不好好练射击，上战场心一慌，就乱打，平时不好好练动作，一打仗就散不开，伤亡大。我想，要练好兵，就要下苦工夫，办法要对头，战术动作和爆炸、投弹、刺杀要好好配合；敌人工事变了，咱就得研究。比方咱们上回作战有毛病，伤亡就大，现在练兵，就要研究打过的仗，练好了真顶用，可是怎么练好呢？那就要发扬批评……”。
    陈伦德听了连声说：“对，对，你的意见我赞成。”第二天，他们就汇报到连立刻又传到营部，经干部们一研究，认为孔、陈两人所提出来的可以归纳成“四大结合”，第一、野外动作与实战相结合；第二、战术与技术相结合；第三、研究敌人与改进自己相结合；第四、批评与学习相结合。
    听了营里的汇报，张团长心里非常感动，回到团部就给各营打电话，叫各营连干部和参谋们开会，会上讨论了怎样把“四项结合”的练兵方法贯彻到各个连队里去，大家提出来好多具体办法，最后决定各营先掌握住一个连，进行具体帮助，取得一些经验，然后再普遍推广。
    　　　　　　×　　　　　　×　　　　　　　×
    团里的练兵热火朝天的展开了，对于通勤杂务人员如何抽出时间进行必要的练兵，这个问题，有些干部觉着没办法。有一天，张团长到九连，看见伙房门口摆着瞄准架，蒸馍的、烧水的、瞄准得有条有理。后到四连，看见壁报上有一幅战士画的“四连伙房一面做饭一面学武”的画，他们分工做饭，夜里把次日工作准备好，第二天就抽时间练兵，于是他到处推广这个办法。第二天到九连，他又看见连长在指导大家瞄准，他想：“对啦！通勤人员练兵还必须有专人指导，才能练得好。”根据这些从群众中得到的启示，他便有了做好勤杂人员练兵的具体办法。
    有一次，因为同志们不下苦工夫，练武时，投机取巧，战士杨中盛发明了一种检查方法，专门检查射击动作是否确实，张团长知道了，便立即进行了表扬，定名为“杨中盛检查法”，不久各营里都采用起来，对提高射击技术起了很大作用。
    　　　　　×　　　　　　　×　　　　　　　　×
    群众的智慧不断的集中到领导者那里。张团长有意识有计划的推广这些优点和办法，练兵得到了不小的收获，在射击测验时，全体百分之九十八的人数，弹中数在百分之九十以上，平均环数在十四环以上。战士们用自己的智慧创造了研究敌人、改进自己的“攻防委员会”，边打边学习，实现了四项结合。
    从这些实际的体验中，张团长获得了一条真理：“群众中蕴藏着无穷的智慧，集中群众的智慧，指导群众，就是一个领导者的领导艺术，走群众路线的方法，如果我们对新鲜事物缺乏敏感，如果我们不向群众学习而缺乏阶级的责任感，　那么我们将永远陷于老一套的圈子里跳不出来。”
