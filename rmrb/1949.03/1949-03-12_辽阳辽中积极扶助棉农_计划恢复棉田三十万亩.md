　　Liaoyang and Liaozhong Actively Support Cotton Farmers
  　Plan to Restore 300,000 Mu of Cotton Fields
    [Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 7th] The Liaoyang and Liaozhong counties in Liaoning Province, a well-known cotton-producing area in Southern Manchuria, plan to restore 300,000 new mu (one mu equals nine thousand square chi) of cotton fields this year. The two counties originally had a total of 610,000 old mu of cotton fields, equivalent to more than 400,000 new mu. As a result of the Kuomintang bandit troops and bureaucratic capital's brutal exploitation before the liberation last autumn, less than 5,000 old mu of cotton fields remained. Now, in accordance with the Liaoning Provincial Government's instructions on developing industrial raw materials, the governments of the two counties plan to restore 70 percent of the cotton fields. In order to help cotton farmers solve the difficulties such as seeds, the two counties decided to issue 3.5 million jin of grain as cotton seed loans. In addition, 18 million jin of grain for purchasing cotton will be advanced, and the accounts will be settled based on the cotton price after the cotton harvest. Furthermore, the government has sent people to help cotton farmers purchase cotton seeds in other areas. With these assistance and encouragement, the cotton farmers are actively preparing the land for cotton planting.

　　辽阳辽中积极扶助棉农
  　计划恢复棉田三十万亩
    【新华社沈阳七日电】南满著名产棉地区辽宁省的辽阳与辽中两县人民政府，今年计划恢复棉田三十万新亩（一亩合九千平方市尺）。该两县原有棉田共六十一万老亩，约合四十万余新亩。由于在去年秋季解放前被国民党匪军和官僚资本残酷搜刮的结果，所剩棉田不到五千老亩。现在该两县政府根据辽宁省政府关于发展工业原料的指示，计划恢复棉田百分之七十。为帮助棉农解决种籽等困难，该两县决定发放棉籽贷粮三百五十万斤。并预先借支购棉粮食一千八百万斤，等棉花收获以后再按棉价折算结帐。此外政府又派人帮助棉农到其他地区购买棉籽。棉农得到这些帮助和鼓励正纷纷准备好地种棉。
