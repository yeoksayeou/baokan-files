　　Renqiu First District Suffers from Insect Pest; County Government Organizing Eradication Efforts
　　[Jizhong News] In the Sanchongfeng area of Renqiu First District, a type of black insect that eats rapeseed and wheat seedlings was discovered on the 14th of this month. The county government immediately dispatched personnel to investigate and organized mobilization for eradication. This insect is about two to three fen in length and is most destructive to rapeseed. The masses are unaware of the insect's name and the cause of its emergence. After research, it is believed to be due to the lack of snow last winter. To prevent a disaster, the county government issued an emergency directive, ordering all districts and villages to conduct a thorough inspection. If any are found, forces should be immediately organized to eliminate them.

　　任邱一区有虫害县府正组织扑打
    【冀中讯】任邱一区三中封一带，本月十四日发现一种吃油菜和麦苗的黑虫。县府立即派员前往检查，组织动员扑打。此虫长二、三分，吃油菜最凶。群众都不知虫名和发生原因。经研究后，认为去冬雪少之故。为预防成灾，县府发出紧急指示，命各区各村普遍检查，如有发现应马上组织力量扑灭。
