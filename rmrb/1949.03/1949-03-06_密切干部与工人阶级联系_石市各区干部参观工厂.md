　　Closely Link Cadres with the Working Class
    Shijiazhuang District Cadres Visit Factories

    [Shijiazhuang News] In order to strengthen the connection between administrative cadres and the working class in Shijiazhuang, and to enhance cadres' knowledge of industrial matters, on the 28th of last month, more than 200 Party, government, and civilian cadres from various districts visited important factories in two large groups. Upon arriving at each factory, technical personnel led the way and explained the performance of the machines and the factory's production competition situation. When everyone saw the workers working intensely, they were all moved. The riveters, wielding heavy iron hammers, transformed many unformed iron blocks into useful tools through their powerful arms. District Chief Sun from the Sixth District worked in the forging department of the Railway Machinery Factory in 1920s. Today, he brought all the cadres from the district to visit. When he saw his old workmate, Comrade Chen De, he took the "handle" of the pneumatic hammer from his hand and skillfully shook it more than a dozen times. The "iron ring" he made was also quite good. Old Chen said with great joy, "We have been old friends for many years. What wind blew you here!" District Chief Sun said, "I am the district chief in the Sixth District. I hope that more workers will participate in the work of the government in the future." People were impressed by the production enthusiasm of the workers manufacturing bridge materials, and felt that the repair of the several major bridges on the Shijiazhuang-Pingdingshan section would be no problem.
    The roving frame section, spinning section, and packing section of the Daxing Yarn Factory were all decorated with several red flags, showing the high morale of the workers. They completed two months of production plans in one and a half months. The director of the Women's Federation of the Second District, seeing the enthusiastic and tense production of the female workers, said excitedly, "Who says our women don't get involved in production? Look how fast their hands are." Comrade Liu Tongle, the chairman of the Trade Union of the Second District, carefully read the factory's blackboard newspapers, wall newspapers, and workers' own increase-production poems. He said, "We must further expand and rectify the organization of trade unions, and raise the class consciousness of workers, shop assistants, and apprentices." District Chief Zheng of the First District said after the visit, "Each factory and each worker, with their strict organization and discipline, concentrate on mastering the machines. From seed cotton to woven cloth, in the entire production process, anyone who acts independently will not be able to weave cloth. It inspires us that the work of the government must have a spirit of seeking truth from facts and a collective style of work; otherwise, we will be detached from the masses." It was not until 3:00 in the afternoon that the cadres from various districts returned to their districts with great interest.

　　密切干部与工人阶级联系
    石市各区干部参观工厂
    【石家庄讯】为加强石市行政干部与工人阶级的联系，并加强干部对工业知识的学习，上月廿八日，各区党政民干部二百余人，分两大队参观各重要工厂，每到一厂即先由各厂技术人员带领，并讲解机器的性能与各厂生产竞赛的情形。当大家看到工人们紧张地工作着的情形时，都被感动了。铆工房的工人们，挥动着笨重的铁锤，把许多未成形的铁块，经过他们有力的手臂，迅速地打成了有用的工具。六区孙区长在民国九年上，就在铁路机厂锻工部作工，今天他带着全区干部来参观，见到老工友陈德同志，就从他手中接过气锤上的“手把”挺熟练地摇了十几下，打出的“铁环”也不错，老陈分外高兴的说：“我们是多年的老朋友啦，久没相见，那股风把你吹来啦！”孙区长说：“我在六区当区长，我希望今后有更多工人参加政权工作。”人们看到制造桥梁器材的工人们那种生产热情，都感到石平段的几座大桥梁的修复是不成问题了。
    大兴纱厂粗纱部、细纱部、成包部，都插着几面红旗，显示着工人生产情绪的高涨，他们是在一个半月里完成了两个月的生产计划的。二区妇联会主任见到女工热情紧张的生产后，兴奋地说：“谁说咱们妇女生产不沾，你看她们的手多快。”二区工会主任刘同乐同志仔细读了工厂的黑板报、墙报及工人自己编写的增产诗，他说：“一定要进一步扩大整顿行业工会组织，提高工人、店员、学徒的阶级觉悟。”一区郑区长参观后说：“每个厂，每个工人，都以他们严密的组织性、纪律性，聚精会神的掌握着机器，从籽棉到织成布，整个的生产过程中，那一个人闹独立性就织不成布。它启示我们政府的工作，要有实事求是的精神，集体主义的作风，否则就会脱离群众。”直到下午三点，各区干部才兴致勃勃地返回本区。
