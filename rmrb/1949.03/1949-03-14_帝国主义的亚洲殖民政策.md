　　Imperialist Colonial Policy in Asia
 　　Pǔlièxiésī Jī
    [Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 11th Dispatch] TASS News: The Soviet "News" newspaper published an article by Pǔlièxiésī Jī on the 6th entitled "The Colonial Policy of Imperialists in Asia," pointing out that the achievements of the democratic forces in China, the armed resistance of the people of Vietnam and Indonesia against the attempts of French and Dutch imperialists to restore their colonial rule, and the resolute struggle of Malaya, Burma, and other Middle Eastern countries for national independence, are causing serious concern within the imperialist camp. The colonialists are desperately trying to maintain their positions in Asian and Far Eastern countries and to keep these countries as colonies subordinate to them forever. The author asserted that imperialist countries are making every effort to obstruct the development of colonial countries towards genuine independence. Imperialist countries, led by the United States and Britain, are using every possible means to prevent the economic and political development of colonial countries, attempting, as in the past, to keep these countries permanently as agricultural and raw material appendages of monopoly giants. The author pointed out that the Soviet Union, which sympathizes with the liberation movements of oppressed peoples, is consistently pursuing its policy of safeguarding the sovereignty of all countries and adhering to its economic and political policies towards colonial and dependent countries. These policies will guide the people of Asia and the Far East towards genuine national independence.

　　帝国主义的亚洲殖民政策
  　普列谢夫斯基
    【新华社陕北十一日电】塔斯社讯：苏联消息报六日刊载普列谢夫斯基所著“帝国主义者的亚洲殖民政策”一文，指出：中国民主力量所获得的成就，越南及印尼人民对于法国及荷兰帝国主义者恢复其殖民地政权企图所进行的武装抵抗，以及马来亚、缅甸及其他中东国家为争取民族独立而进行的坚决斗争，正引起帝国主义阵营内的严重忧虑。殖民者正在拚命地努力，以保持其在亚洲国家及远东国家中所把持的地位，并使这些国家永远作为殖民地而附属于它们。作者力称：帝国主义国家正在尽一切努力以阻挠殖民地国家朝着真正独立方向的发展。以美英两国为首的帝国主义国家，正在用一切可能的办法来阻止殖民地国家经济上及政治上的发展，企图象过去一样，使这些国家永远是垄断巨头之农业及原料的附属国。作者指出：同情被压迫人民解放运动的苏联，正在坚持不渝地执行其维护各国主权的政策，并恪守其对于殖民地国家及附属国的经济方针和政治方针。这些方针将引导亚洲及远东人民走向真正的民族独立。
