　　Yonghua Match Factory's Production Movement
　　Lin Yuan
　　I. Production Rate Exceeds Pre-War Levels

　　The production movement held last winter at the Yonghua Match Factory in Botou City (a joint public-private enterprise with 80% public funds and 20% private funds) not only successfully exceeded the production plan, but also significantly surpassed pre-war levels in terms of production rate.

　　The factory's production movement began on December 6th of last year and lasted until January 5th of this year, with 28 actual working days. At the beginning of the movement, the factory set a daily output target of 26 cases (the daily output before the movement was 20 cases). Because the factory underwent public branch meetings and "three appraisals" (appraising work, unity, and study), the workers' awareness generally increased, and they consciously joined the production movement, achieving an average daily output of 30 cases (1440 packs per case), exceeding the production plan. Due to the increase in production, the labor used to produce finished products also decreased relatively. Before the movement, each case required an average of 5.17 direct labor units, which has now been reduced to 4.05. Indirect labor has decreased from an average of 1.3 units to 0.7. In addition, workers automatically saved raw materials and reduced costs during the movement. Calculated based on prices during the previous movement (September of last year), the cost per small mat (240 packs) was reduced by 11.04 yuan (People's Currency) compared to the previous period.

　　The improvement in production efficiency is even more significant compared to the pre-war period. Taking the axis-arranging section as an example: When private capitalists operated the factory one or two years before the War of Resistance Against Japan, the axis-arranging machines were newly installed, the quality of the wood was high, and the stems were easy to shake. They worked 12 hours a day, but the daily output of each machine was generally 41 or 42 carts, with a maximum record of only 47 or 48 carts (30 boards per cart). In terms of quality, each board averaged 2,000 matchsticks. Now, the machines are old, the quality of the wood is poor, and it is more difficult to shake the stems. They work 10 hours a day, and the objective conditions are far worse than before the war, but the productivity of each machine has greatly exceeded the pre-war level. For example, the average daily output of the eight better-functioning machines (mostly operated by old workers from before the War of Resistance) is 53 carts. The daily output of Li Jun's machine averaged 55.3 carts over four weeks, breaking the pre-war record. During the production movement, in addition to the above eight machines, five more old and broken machines were re-installed. The workers were mostly new, and the average daily output of each of the 13 machines was 49.16 carts, which also exceeded the pre-war record. Each board also maintained an average of 2,400 matchsticks, and the quality was better than before the war.

　　II. The Party's Labor Policy Promotes Worker Awareness

　　Why has the factory's productivity increased unprecedentedly now? In addition to several objective reasons, such as the workers being inspired by the victory of the revolutionary war, the better season, fewer worker illnesses, sufficient raw materials, and fast sales, the most fundamental reason is that the Party's policy has promoted worker awareness. Since the factory was converted into a joint public-private enterprise in March of last year, worker representatives have participated in the factory management committee. In addition to wages and overtime bonuses, workers can receive 4% of the net profit as dividends, and 2.5% of the total wages as welfare funds and 1.5% as education funds. This has fundamentally changed the relationship between workers and the factory from the past labor-capital antagonism to the current situation of considering both public and private interests and benefiting both labor and capital. In the past, capitalists often induced workers to produce more, saying, "If the meat is fat, the soup will also be fat." The workers would give the most vivid answer to this hypocritical deception: "That's a deceiving statement. The result is clear water with meatballs; the meat is fat, but the soup is not." The current overtime bonus is formulated through mass participation and is relatively reasonable. The factory has launched three production movements last year. Based on this, especially after the open party member meetings and the three appraisal movements, the workers have a further understanding of the factory. Their reflection: "The factory has mainly become state-owned, the finances (referring to the accounts) are open, the state gets more when it makes money, and individuals can also get a larger share." Therefore, the vast majority of workers consciously changed their past methods of dealing with capitalists and established a new attitude towards labor. They consciously abide by labor discipline and obey leadership. In the past, when the work affairs section inspected, some people made sarcastic remarks. Now, the vast majority are humble and encourage each other to abide by the labor agreement. Out of the factory's total of 450 workers, the number of workers actually present during the production movement accounted for 98.05%, and those who asked for leave accounted for only 0.53%. One of the most popular saying among workers is: "Now we are not like short-term workers in the past; we also have a share in the factory!" In the past, the shaft-removing team repaired the machine exclusively by the team leader, now the workers automatically participate in the repair, moving the old team leader who said, "The workers are much easier to lead than before." For example, in terms of saving raw materials: The printing team can save an average of one catty of pink glazed paper every day by studying paper cutting techniques, worth 3,000 yuan in new currency. Female workers in the packaging team automatically pasted broken boxes, overcoming the past phenomenon of throwing plates randomly. In the material section of the box. The cut shaft thread. In the past, the first knife cut off, leaving more than an inch of waste, now only five minutes are left, in the past some good stems (match sticks) in the first two knives are also discarded, now all the good ones are picked out.

　　III. Party Members Played a Backbone Role

　　Before the production movement, there were 85 party members in the factory, about one-fifth of all employees. Since the open branch meetings, every party member has understood that actively producing and leading and connecting with the masses is the only way to be a good party member. Some party members deeply felt in their self-criticism that they did not realize in the past that the current factory is mainly under the leadership of the Party, and its nature is different from when the capitalists managed it themselves. It is wrong to still have the thought of muddling through and a strong old labor attitude. They demanded to launch a production movement to make up for past losses. Because party members launched self-criticism in front of the workers, which improved the prestige of the Party and improved the relationship between the Party and the masses. Following this, on this basis, party members led the masses into the three appraisals, so that workers had a clearer understanding of the factory, and the class consciousness was generally improved, so the factory put forward a production competition appeal, and then turned into a conscious and voluntary movement for the workers, and automatically formulated challenge plans and labor conventions. The trade union was used as the main body for review, so that the production plan came from the masses and then went to the masses, laying a solid foundation for the production movement.

　　In order to perfectly achieve the task of organizing and mobilizing the workers, before organizing the mobilization meeting for the entire factory, the leadership seized the key link in the production unit - the shaft-arranging team with the largest party member base, which played a leading role in the conference, such as the party members Wang Ximing and Wei Xuequan took the initiative to help others repair the machines. One day, Wang Ximing shook out 63 carts, setting a new record. Party member Zhao Zhanfang of the sawing team smashed his foot while transporting wood, but refused to rest. Due to the exemplary role of party members, the Party's prestige among the masses has been improved, and 13 activists have been admitted to the Party in the production movement.

　　IV. Leadership Paid Attention to Work Calculation

　　In terms of leadership, the cooperation between the factory's administration, branch, and trade union is generally relatively close, the steps are consistent, and the opinions of workers are absorbed, so attention is paid to revising and adjusting some inappropriate calculations and organizations: for example, the estimated number of working hours for the shaft-arranging machine was originally 46 carts, but was later revised and increased to 48 carts. The original estimated number of working hours for No. 3 shaft machine was too low, and it was also increased from 27 boards to 33 boards; for sawing calculations, the calculation was changed from by material to by square foot of saw cut; for the method of placing boards stained with sulfur, the old method was broken, and the sulfur head was changed to droop down, so that the sulfur was easy to condense; in order to maintain quality, a sulfur plate and a medicine plate were added, which reduced the number of bad boards, from a maximum of 195 bad boards per day to 50 boards. In the movement, the food management of male workers has been improved, and because female workers (paid by the piece) eat breakfast delivered to the factory, it is often cold. In the second half of the month, the trade union also sold rice to female workers at a price lower than the market price, which made the workers very satisfied, thus ensuring the smooth progress of the movement.

　　The main defect is that the factory's leadership thinking is biased towards increasing output, and not enough attention is paid to quality, and the bonus method has not been carefully studied and revised. Generally speaking, the progressive number of overtime bonuses is large, and the progressive number of quality is small, and some production units even have no quality bonus. For example, the overtime bonus for a shaft-arranging machine (two people) ranges from 52 catties of rice to 300 catties, while the medicine plate only has a quality bonus, with a maximum of 150 catties per shift (three people), so workers are much more interested in increasing production than improving quality. Therefore, it failed to further inspire the wisdom of the workers, induce and organize them to discuss democratically, and to study the possible conditions for improving production methods and transforming tools. Secondly, because the leadership neglected study, coupled with the workers' fatigue, the workers' study was completely stopped, and no possible cultural and entertainment activities were organized to regulate the workers' lives. If the above defects can be overcome, the factory's production movement will have greater gains and achievements.

　　永华火柴厂的生产运动
    林远
    一、生产率超过战前水平
    泊头市公私合营的永华火柴厂（公营资金百分之八十，私人资金百分之二十），去冬举行的生产运动，不仅胜利地超过了生产计划，在生产率方面也远超过战前的水平。
    该厂生产运动，自去年十二月六日开始，到今年一月五日止，实际工作日为二十八天。运动开始，该厂规定日产量为二十六箱（运动前日产量为二十箱），因为该厂经过支部公开和“三评”（评工作、评团结、评学习），工人觉悟普遍提高，自觉涌入生产运动，平均日产量达到三十箱（每箱一四四○包），超过了生产计划。由于生产的提高，成品制出所用人工也相对减少了，运动前每箱平均用直接工五点一七个，现在减低到四点零五个。间接工平均由一点三个减为零点七个。加以工人在运动中自动的节省原料，减少了成本，按前期运动（去年九月）时物价计算，合计每小席（二四零包）较前期减低成本十一元零四角（人民币）。
    生产效率的提高，如与战前相比，更为显著，以排轴股为例：当抗日战争前一、二年私人资本家自己经营时，排轴机是新置的，木料质量强，梗子好摇，每天工作十二小时，但每部机器的日产量一般为四十一、二车，最高纪录才达四十七、八车（每车三十板），质量上每板平均二千根苗。现在机器都旧了，木料质量差，摇梗子时比较费力，每天工作十小时，客观条件远差于战前，但每部机器的生产率却大大超过战前的水平，如比较好使用的八部机器（多是抗战前的老工人）底日产量平均为五十三车，李俊三这部机器，在四周中平均日产量竟达到五十五点三车，突破了战前的最高纪录。在生产运动中除以上八部外，又重新装置了五部更破旧的老机器，工人多是新手，共十三部机器，平均每部机器的日产量为四十九点一六车，也超过了战前最高纪录，每板并平均保持二千四百根苗，质量也胜于战前。
    二、党的劳动政策促进工人觉悟
    为什么现在该厂生产力空前提高了呢？除了工人受革命战争底胜利鼓舞，季节较好，工人疾病少，原料充足，销路快等几个客观原因外，最基本的是由于党的政策促进了工人的觉悟。该厂自去年三月改成公私合营后，工人代表参加了工厂管理委员会，除工资和超工奖外，工人分红能得纯利百分之四，工人并能得工资总数的百分之二点五为福利金，百分之一点五的教育费，这样就使工人和厂方的关系，由过去的劳资对立、到目前已基本上改变成公私兼顾与劳资两利了。以前资本家常诱骗工人多生产，说什么“肉肥汤也肥”，工人们对这种虚伪的欺骗，会给以最生动的回答：“那是哄骗人的话，结局是白水川丸子，肉肥汤不肥”。现在的超工奖是经过群众制订的，面宽比较合理。该厂去年曾开展过三次生产运动，在此基础上，特别是又经过党员公开和三评运动，工人对工厂有了进一步的认识。他们的反映：“工厂主要变成了国家的，经济（指帐目）公开，赚了钱国家多得了，个人也能多分些”。因此，绝大多数工人自觉的改变了过去对付资本家的一套办法，树立了新的劳动态度。自觉的遵守劳动纪律，服从领导。过去，工务科检查时，有的说怪话，现在绝大多数虚心了，并互相勉励遵守劳动公约。全厂工人共四五○人，生产运动中实到工人数占百分之九十八点○五，请事假的只占百分之零点五三。在工人中最流行的一句话：“现在咱们不象过去打短工的，工厂也有咱们的一份了”！卸轴股过去全由股长一个人修理机器，现在工人都自动参加修理，感动的老股长说：“工人比以前好领导得多了。”再如以节省原料来说：印刷股由于研究了裁纸技术，平均每天能节省一斤粉连纸，值新币三千元。包装股女工自动糊破盒，克服了过去乱摔盘子现象。盒料股的切轴线。以前切头一刀，留一寸多废活，现在只留五分，以前头两刀中有的好梗子（火柴杆）也都不要了，现在将好的都拣出来。
    三、党员起了骨干作用
    在生产运动前，该厂共有党员八十五人，约近全体职工的五分之一，自支部公开后，每个党员都懂得了积极生产并带动联系群众，才能算是好党员。有的党员在自我检讨时，深感过去没有认识目前工厂主要是在党的领导下，它的性质和资本家自己管理时已不同了。仍象过去存有混天思想，和浓厚的旧劳动态度是不对的，要求开展生产运动，弥补过去的损失。由于党员在工人面前展开了自我批评，提高了党的威信，改善了党与群众的关系。继之，在此基础上又通过党员带领群众进入三评，使工人对工厂都有了比较明确的认识，阶级觉悟有了普遍提高，所以厂方一提出生产竞赛号召，随即变为工人自觉自愿的运动，自动的制订挑战计划和劳动公约。并以职工会为主的进行审查，使生产计划由群众中来，再到群众中去，给生产运动打下巩固的基础。
    为了完满地达到组织和动员工人底任务，在组织全厂职工挑战动员大会以前，领导上又抓紧了生产单位中的主要环节——党员基础最大的排轴股，在大会上起了带头作用，如党员王锡铭、魏学泉二人都主动的帮助别人修理机器。有一天，王锡铭曾摇出六十三车，创造了最高纪录。锯工股党员赵占方在运木料时，砸了脚，还不肯休息。由于党员的模范作用，党在群众中的威信提高了，在生产运动中有十三名积极份子被吸收入党。
    四、领导上注意了工作计算
    在领导上，该厂行政、支部、职工会的配合，一般地比较密切，步调一致，并吸收工人意见，因而注意了修改和调整某些不适当的计算和组织：如排轴机的估工数，原有的八部机器为四十六车，后修正增到四十八车。第三号轴机原估工数过低，亦由二十七板增至三十三板；对锯工计算，由按料改为按平方尺计算锯口；对沾硫磺的放板方法，打破老一套，改使磺头下垂，使磺易于凝聚；为了保持质量，硫磺盘和药盘各添一个，因之减少了坏板，由每天最多坏一九五块板减到五十块。在运动中，男工的伙食管理有了改进，另因女工（按件计资）的早饭，是把饭送到厂里吃，常凉了，职工会于后半月亦以低于市价卖饭给女工，使工人们很满意，因而保证了运动的顺利进行。
    主要缺陷是该厂的领导思想，偏于增加产量，对质量注意不够，没有认真的研究与修正奖励办法。一般的说超工奖累进数大，质量的累进数小，有的生产单位甚至没有质量奖。如排轴机一部（两个人）超工奖，由五十二斤米到三百斤，药盘仅有质量奖，每班（三个人）最多一五○斤，所以，工人对增产比提高质量的兴趣大的多。因之未能进一步的启发工人的智慧，诱导和组织他们民主的讨论，来研究可能条件下的改进生产方法，改造工具。其次因为领导上忽视学习，加上工人比较疲劳，致使工人的学习完全停止了，也没有组织可能的文化娱乐活动，以调剂工人的生活。如果以上缺陷能得到克服，该厂的生产运动会有更大的收获和成绩的。
