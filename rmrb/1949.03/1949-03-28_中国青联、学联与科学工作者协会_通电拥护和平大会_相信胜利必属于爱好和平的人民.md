Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 26th: The All-China Federation of Democratic Youth and the All-China Students' Federation of the Liberated Areas of China yesterday separately issued telegrams responding to the declaration and suggestions from the World Congress of Intellectuals in Defence of Peace and others, calling for a World Peace Congress, and stating that they would immediately send representatives to Paris to attend the conference. The telegram from the All-China Federation of Democratic Youth of the Liberated Areas of China said: All of China's democratic youth are willing to use their own bloody experiences to point out and accuse American imperialism before the people of the world as the instigator of war. As early as 1947, it first colluded with the Kuomintang bandit gang in China to launch and direct a bloody civil war that slaughtered the Chinese people and youth. Now the whole world knows that it is not the Chinese people who have suffered a disastrous defeat, but the American imperialists themselves and their running dog Kuomintang bandit gang. If American imperialism dares to provoke a new world war, then the fate they will suffer will only be worse than what they have suffered in China. For more than twenty years, the people and youth of all of China have established the closest and most solid revolutionary friendship with the people and youth of the Soviet Union. Whether in times of international peace or war, we will definitely stand with the people and youth of the Soviet Union, with the people and youth of all people's democratic countries, and with all peace-loving and democratic forces in the world, resolutely oppose imperialist countries and their war-mongers, and fight to the end for lasting peace and people's democracy. Victory will surely belong to the peace-loving people of the world. The telegram from the All-China Students' Federation said: The current conspiracy of imperialism to create a new world war completely violates the will of peace-loving youth and students all over the world and in China. The call to oppose war instigators and strive for lasting peace, led by the Soviet Union, is entirely in line with our wishes.

Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 27th: The China Association for Scientific Workers has issued a declaration in response to the World Peace Congress. The original text is as follows:

The members of the China Association for Scientific Workers, after hearing the recent joint appeal from Paris by the International Liaison Committee of the World Congress of Intellectuals in Defence of Peace, the Women's International Democratic Federation, and renowned cultural, scientific, and artistic figures, wholeheartedly and unhesitatingly respond and will do our best to support it.

In the last sacred war against fascist aggression, scientists all over the world collectively contributed the scientific achievements of their lifetime of hard work to defend culture and to safeguard the democratic and free rights of the people, thereby accelerating the collapse of the Hitler bandit gang. This historical fact fully demonstrates the glorious tradition of scientists in upholding the truth and their great power. Who would have thought that in the four years since the end of the last world war, the aggressive bloc headed by American imperialism has completely inherited Hitler's despicable and shameless tricks,妄想 to enslave scientists and steal scientific research results to fulfill its ambition of trampling on culture and conquering the world. In particular, the recent North Atlantic Treaty clearly exposes the conspiracy of the Anglo-American imperialist aggressive bloc to show its ferocity to the peace-loving people of the world. We, the members of the China Association for Scientific Workers, especially issue a solemn statement here: If the Anglo-American imperialists dare to ignite the flames of anti-people war in any region of the world, we will not hesitate to stand on the side of the world peace fortress—the Soviet Union, unite all the Chinese people and outstanding scientists in the world, and use all our strength to shatter the aggressive dreams of the Anglo-American imperialist bandit gang. We have not forgotten that the Chinese people's eight years of resistance war once defeated a Japanese imperialism with superior arms, and in the last three years, we have defeated the Kuomintang reactionaries armed by American imperialism with billions of dollars of the latest equipment. Although the new war danger created single-handedly by the war provocateurs exists seriously, we have full confidence that we can overcome it. Now we will send our representatives to the World Peace Congress to be held in Paris on April 20 to convey our determination to oppose aggression and defend peace. We firmly believe that as long as the peace-loving people of the world are firmly united and strive unremittingly, the new war danger can be overcome, and democratic and lasting peace can be won.

    通电拥护和平大会
    相信胜利必属于爱好和平的人民
    【新华社北平二十六日电】中国解放区青年联合会与中华全国学生联合会前日分别发出通电，响应世界文化工作者保卫和平大会等所发起的召开世界拥护和平大会的宣言和建议，并表示立即派遣代表前往巴黎出席大会。中国解放区青年联合会的通电说：全中国的民主青年愿以亲身血的经历，在全世界人民面前指出并控诉美帝国主义就是挑拨战争的主义。它远在一九四七年就首先在中国勾结国民党匪帮，发动了并指挥着屠杀中国人民和青年的血腥内战。现在全世界都知道遭受惨败的不是中国人民，却正是美帝国主义者自己及其走狗国民党匪帮。如果美帝国主义胆敢挑动新的世界战争，那么他们将要漕受的命运只会比他们在中国所遭受的坏。我们全中国的人民和青年与苏联的人民和青年，二十多年来，建立了最密切与最巩固的革命友谊，无论在国际和平时期或战争时期，我们誓必和苏联人民和青年站在一起，和一切人民民主国家的人民和青年站在一起，和全世界爱好和平与民主力量站在一起，坚决反对帝国主义国家及其战争贩子，为争取持久和平与人民民主而奋斗到底。胜利一定属于全世界爱好和平的人民。中华全国学生联合会的通电中说：目前帝国主义制造新的世界战争的阴谋，完全违反全世界与全中国爱好和平的青年学生的意志。以苏联为首的反对战争挑拨者，争取持久和平的号召，则完全合乎我们的愿望。
    【新华社北平二十七日电】中国科学工作者协会顷发表响应世界拥护和平大会宣言，原文如下：
    中国科学工作者协会的会员们，听到世界文化工作者保卫和平大会国际联络委员会、国际民主妇女联合会以反世界著名文化、科学、艺术工作者最近联名从巴黎发出拥护世界和平的呼吁以后，我们毫不迟疑地热烈响应，并将尽力予以支持。
    在上次反法西斯侵略的神圣战争中，全世界的科学工作者们为了保卫文化，为了保障人民的民主自由权利，曾经集体地贡献了他们毕生辛勤研究的科学成果，从而加速了希特勒匪帮的溃亡。这一历史事实，充分表现了科学工作者们维护真理的光荣传统和他们巨大的力量。谁料在上次世界大战结束后的四年里，以美帝国主义为首的侵略集团竟完全承袭了希特勒卑劣无耻的故技，妄想奴役科学工作者，篡窃科学研究成果来逞其践踏文化征服世界的野心。特别是最近的北大西洋公约，更明显的暴露了美英帝国主义侵略集团向全世界爱好和平的人民逞凶的阴谋。我们中国的科学工作者协会的会员们，特别在这里发出庄严的声明：如果美英帝国主义者竟敢于在全世界的任何地区，燃起反人民的战火，我们将毫不迟疑地站在世界和平堡垒——苏联一边，团结全中国人民与全世界的优秀科学工作者，拿出我们全部的力量来粉碎美英帝国主义匪帮的侵略迷梦。我们完全没有忘掉，中国人民八年的抗战，曾经打败了一个武装优越的日本帝国主义，最近三年又打败了由美帝国主义以数十亿元的最新装备武装起来的国民党反动派。现在战争挑拨者所一手制造的新的战争危险，虽然严重地存在着，但我们完全有信心可以克服它。现在我们将选派我们的代表出席四月二十号在巴黎召开的世界拥护和平大会，来传达我们反对侵略维护和平的决心。我们坚决相信，只要全世界爱好和平的人民巩固地团结起来，并奋斗不懈，那么新的战争危险一定可以被克服，民主的持久的和平一定能赢得。
