　　“We Want to Fight for Peace and Bread!”
    Vienna Women's Anti-War Demonstration
    Demands Severe Punishment for Those Who Propagandize War
    [Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, March 29th] Viennese women, under the call of the Austrian Democratic Women's League, held a grand demonstration and march to oppose the incitement of new wars and demand peace. According to TASS, at noon on the 27th, tens of thousands of female factory workers, workers' mothers and wives, staff members of government and mass organizations marched towards the city center. Their long banners read: "We Fight for Peace and Bread," "Suppress Warmongers," "Mothers' Front Against the Murderers' Front," "Don't Let Our Children Shed Blood for Foreign Masters," "Welcome the Soviet Union's Peaceful Policy," "The North Atlantic Treaty Brings the Threat of War," "Long Live Lasting Peace!" and other slogans. Residents of Vienna filled the streets of the city center, warmly welcoming the demonstrators.
    Twenty-five thousand people held a rally in front of the City Hall. Lusha Karl Haifa, a member of the Progressive Socialist Party, addressed the audience, saying: "We remember that the Soviet Union shouldered the main burden of the war against Hitlerism, while American capitalists only seized huge war profits. Today, when the wounds of war have not yet healed, and when every family is still mourning the sons who died in the war, we hear again that Western countries are engaged in an arms race. In those countries, what is being discussed is not peace, but the manufacture of weapons, the establishment of bomber bases and war."
    Communist Party member Ella Bausterlanicki called on Austrian women to wage a persistent struggle against those who are plotting to inflict the disasters of a new war on mankind. She said: "Those who seek war profits want to incite a new world war. Imperialists, desiring war, are about to conclude the North Atlantic Treaty. They are trying to use this treaty to turn us into a 'protected area'. But we all remember that when the Hitler gang occupied Austria, they also claimed to 'place Austria under their protection.' But later, they sent our husbands and sons to the slaughterhouse. The North Atlantic Treaty is a military treaty and a plot against world peace. Therefore, the struggle for peace is also the struggle against the Atlantic Treaty."
    In their speeches, working women demanded that the government pass laws to severely punish those engaged in war propaganda. They also strongly protested against the government's plan to establish new taxes to maintain the army.
    The conference passed a resolution condemning American war instigators. The Democratic Women of Vienna vowed to do their best to fight for the defense of peace and friendship between nations.

　　“我们要为和平与面包而战！”
    维也纳妇女反战示威
    要求严惩宣传战争者
    【新华社北平二十九日电】奥京维也纳的妇女们，在奥国民主妇联的号召下，举行盛大示威游行，反对煽动新战争，要求和平。据塔斯社讯：二十七日中午成千累万的工厂女工、工人们的母亲和妻子、政府和群众团体的工作人员，向市中心进发。她们的长幅标语上写着：“我们为和平和面包而战”，“压制战争贩子”，“用母亲阵线反对杀人者阵线”，“不让我们的儿女为外国主子们流血”，“欢迎苏联的和平政策”，“北大西洋公约带来战争威胁”，“巩固持久的和平万岁！”等口号。维也纳居民挤满了市中心街道，热诚地欢迎示威队伍。
    二万五千人在市政厅前举行集会。进步社会党党员卢沙·卡尔海法向听众演说称：“我们记得苏联担承了对希特勒主义战争的主要负担，而美国资本家只是掠取了巨大的战争利润。今天，当战争的创伤还没有医好，当每一个家庭还在为战争死亡的儿子哀恸的时候，我们又听见西方国家正在进行军备竞赛。在那些国家里所讨论的不是和平而是制造武器，建立轰炸机基地和战争。”
    共产党员埃拉·鲍斯特拉尼基号召奥地利妇女对那些阴谋将新战争的灾难加诸人类的人们，进行坚持的斗争。她说：那些寻求战争利润的人，想要煽起新的世界战争。帝国主义者想望战争正要缔结北大西洋公约。他们企图借这个公约把我们变成一个“被保护区”。但是我们都还记得：当希特勒匪帮占领奥国的时候，他们同样也是声言“把奥国放在他们的保护之下”的。但后来，他们就把我们的丈夫和儿子送上屠场。北大西洋公约是军事公约，是对全世界和平的谋害。因此，争取和平的斗争也就是反对大西洋公约的斗争。
    劳动妇女在她们的发言中，要求政府通过法律严惩从事战争宣传的人。她们并强力抗议政府设立新税，以维持军队的计划。
    大会通过决议，谴责美国战争挑拨者。维也纳民主妇女立誓尽全力为保卫和平与各国间的友谊而战。
