Chahar Province's agricultural production in 1948 was carried out under two different situations: the areas occupied by the Kuomintang bandit gangs in the Jirecha area (冀热察) and the Beiyue area (北岳). In the Jirecha area, the enemy had occupied most of the counties, constantly attacking and destroying our liberated areas; in addition, wind, hail, and drought disasters had plagued some areas for years. Severe natural disasters and enemy troubles made the multi-season production in the year before last (1947), which was the preparation work for last year's production, fail to achieve the expected results. Therefore, last year's production in the area was carried out under the方針: "using war to defend production, and using production to overcome famine and support the war." Thanks to the heroic annihilation of the enemy by the People's Liberation Army and the active efforts of the Party, government, and people, the people of the entire area quickly completed the autumn harvest, threshing, and storage, crushing the Kuomintang bandit army's autumn grain robbery plan in Chengde at that time. Furthermore, through the development of labor mutual aid, 60% of the cultivated land area in the entire area was completed during the autumn plowing. Subsequently, the people of the entire area were led to carry out winter production, which partially remedied the difficulties of the masses. For example, by the end of December last year, Sihai County purchased 1,300 shi of grain from transportation and sales alone.

In the Beiyue area, most of the areas were in a relatively stable environment and carried out production and construction. Land reform was universally implemented in the old and semi-old areas, eliminating feudalism. The vast number of farmers obtained land and partially solved the difficulties of living materials and production materials. The Party and government leaders at all levels implemented the policy of focusing on production, overcoming the difficulties of insufficient manpower and livestock power, and overcoming the disasters in some areas. Agriculture achieved great success. During spring plowing and summer planting, various places universally carried out the work of eliminating wasteland. According to statistics from the five special districts of Yanbei, Chanan, Pingxi, Yishui, and Jianping, 164,750 mu of wasteland was eliminated. In strengthening water conservancy management, special cadres were assigned to all major canals. The democratic government lent more than 300,000 jin of grain to ensure the timely completion of water release. Seven major canals, such as the Rongzhen Canal in Quyang and the Ji San Canal in Pingshan, were renovated and expanded. 56 canals were opened in 10 counties, including Fanshi and Xingtang, and 775 waterwheels were installed, increasing paddy fields by 104,994 mu. Among the three farms and five promotion farms, 13 improved varieties have been successfully tested in the past two years, and 380 dan of improved varieties of millet, sorghum, etc. have been collected, and more than 57,000 jin of improved varieties such as "72" wheat have been promoted, among which "72" wheat is very popular among the masses. The prevention and control of plant diseases and insect pests has basically achieved "destroying them wherever they are found," reducing the threat of plant diseases and insect pests. During the hot season, we also widely carried out the fertilizer accumulation campaign. In Yi County, 173 villages beat more than 10 million jin of Artemisia during the assault week alone. In Wanxian County, each village in the sixth district pressed more than 200,000 jin of green fertilizer for the families of revolutionary martyrs and soldiers. After the enlarged cadre meeting in August, various places implemented the spirit of "starting production first" in ending land reform work, completed the autumn harvest in a timely manner, and carried out autumn plowing vigorously. The entire area plowed 10,851,900 mu of land in autumn. Each county in Jianping Special District achieved "plowing without stopping when the ground is not frozen." After autumn plowing, winter plowing followed closely. By mid-December, 2,313,000 mu of land had been plowed, accounting for 78% of the total cultivated land area. Jianping Special District planted 1,342,900 mu of wheat, 1.9 times more than the 450,000 mu of wheat planted the previous year. In terms of forest protection and tree planting, the phenomenon of indiscriminate felling was basically prohibited. The entire area planted more than 2,379,000 trees in one year and planted 1,477,200 nests of trees. According to a survey of nine regions, the survival rate of tree planting generally reached about 75%. All localities have also paid great attention to the protection and breeding of livestock. The number of livestock in the old areas has gradually increased. Six counties, including Guangling, have established livestock mating stations, breeding 5,885 heads of livestock. In terms of labor mutual aid, farmers in various places have quite universally organized small plowing groups. In particular, great achievements have been made in mobilizing women to participate in labor last year. Women participating in agricultural labor in the entire region accounted for 60% of the women with labor power. Production promotion cooperatives have been established in 20 counties, equipped with 707 people. If cadres and funds can be enriched, and supply and marketing businesses can be strengthened in the widespread development of the cooperative movement, they will become powerful organizations to promote agricultural production.

At present, the following shortcomings and biases still exist in the province's production leadership: (1) In leading labor mutual aid, the principle of equivalent voluntary participation was emphasized, and opposition to forced compilation. Although there are still phenomena of forced compilation, the main bias is still laissez-faire. For example, without analyzing whether the leadership is good or bad, it is generally said: "It is better not to lead, and it will be bad once it is led." After deployment and calls, there is a lack of in-depth inspection and specific organizational work. It is not possible to exchange experiences in a timely manner, and it is not good at combining other work with production as the center. The substitute farming work for the families of revolutionary martyrs, soldiers, and workers is also very poorly done. Many areas still do not sufficiently recognize the importance of mobilizing women to produce. (2) The management of water conservancy, especially the lower-level organizations of large canals, is still unsound. The benevolent views of some cadres have cultivated the masses' mentality of dependence. They are only willing to use water but unwilling to bear the burden, which has affected the development and protection of canals, making water chaotic and disputes still occur from time to time. Flood prevention and siltation have not attracted universal attention. (3) The forestry and pastoral management agencies are not sound. In some areas, the contradiction between banning mountains and protecting forests and the current lives of the masses has not been properly resolved. In some areas, the burden of service is unfair, the communal feeding is not effective, and the principle of voluntary equivalence is not implemented in the mutual assistance of human and livestock plowing. The lack of veterinarians has affected the reproduction and development of livestock. The above shortcomings and biases need to be overcome in the 1949 production movement.

　　积极加强今年生产
    察省总结去年农业生产中的经验教训
    察哈尔省一九四八年的农业生产是在被国民党匪帮分割为冀热察与北岳两个地区两种不同的情况下进行的。在冀热察区敌人曾侵占了大部县份，不断向我解放区进攻破坏；加之风、雹、旱灾也在部分地区连年侵袭。严重的天灾敌患就使作为去年生产准备工作的前年（一九四七年）多季生产没有收到预期效果。因之去年该区的生产便是在“用战争保卫生产，而又以生产来渡过灾荒与支援战争”的方针下进行的。由于解放军的英勇歼敌和党政民的积极努力，全区人民实行快收、快打、快藏迅速完成了秋收，粉碎了当时承德国民党匪军的秋季抢粮计划。又由于开展了劳动互助，在秋耕中，完成了全区耕地面积的百分之六十。接着又领导全区人民开展冬季生产使群众的困难得到部份补救。如四海县至去年十二月底止，仅运销一项全县即购粮一千三百石。
    在北岳方面则大部地区是处在相对安定的环境下，进行了生产建设。老区半老区普遍实行了土地改革消灭了封建，广大农民获得了土地，部分地解决了生活资料与生产资料的困难，各级党政领导又贯彻了以生产为主的方针，克服了人畜力不足的困难，战胜了部份地区的灾荒，农业生产获得巨大成绩。在春耕夏种中各地普遍进行了消灭荒地的工作，据雁北、察南、平西、易水、建屏五个专区统计：消灭荒地即达十六万四千七百五十亩。在加强水利管理上，各大渠都配备了专门干部，民主政府曾贷粮卅余万斤，保证了及时完工放水、整修和扩大了曲阳的荣臻渠和平山的计三渠等七道大渠，繁峙、行唐等十县开渠五十六道，修装水车七百七十五架，增加水田十万零四千九百九十四亩。在三个农场五个推广场中，两年来试验成功的优良品种十三种，搜集了谷、高粱等优良品种三百八十大石，推广“七二”小麦等优良品种五万七千余斤，其中“七二”小麦很受群众欢迎。对于病虫害的防除，基本上作到了“发现在哪里消灭在哪里”，减少了病虫害的威胁。暑伏季节我们又广泛地开展了压肥运动，易县一百七十三个村只在突击旬中打蒿即达千余万斤。完县六区各村仅给烈军工属压青二十余万斤。八月扩大干部会议后，各地在结束土地改革工作中又贯彻了“先动生产之手”的精神，及时完成了秋收大力进行了秋耕，全区秋耕地达一千零八十五万一千九百亩。建屏专区各县作到了“地不冻犁不停”，秋耕之后紧接着又是冬耕，到十二月中旬止，耕地达二百卅一万三千余亩，占总耕地面积的百分之七十八。建屏专区种麦一百卅四万二千九百亩，超过前年种麦四十五万亩的一点九倍。在护林植树工作上，基本上禁止了乱砍乱伐的现象，全区一年中植树二百三十七万九千余株；种树一百四十七万七千二百窝。据九个地区调查植树成活率一般均达百分之七十五左右。牲畜的保护与繁殖，各地也已给予了极大的注意。老区牲畜数目已日渐上升，广灵等六个县已设立了牲畜交配站，繁殖牲畜五千八百八十五头。在劳动互助方面，各地农民相当普遍地组织了小型的拨工组，特别是发动妇女参加劳动上，去年获得很大成绩，在全区妇女参加农业劳动者占有劳动力妇女的百分之六十。在二十个县设立了生产推进社，配备了七百零七人，如再能充实干部资金，在广泛开展合作运动中，加强供销业务，将会成为推进农业生产的有力组织。
    目前全省在生产领导上还存在着以下的缺点和偏向：（一）在领导劳动互助上，强调了等价自愿的原则反对强迫编制后，虽然还有强迫编制的现象，但主要偏向，还是放任自流。如不分析领导好坏与否，笼统地说：“不领导还好，一领导就坏了”，一般在布置号召后，缺乏深入的检查和具体的组织工作，不能及时交流经验，还不善于以生产为中心，结合进行其他工作。对烈、军、工属的代耕工作也做的很差。不少地区对发动妇女生产的重要性还认识不足。（二）对水利的管理，尤其大渠道的下层组织仍不健全；某些干部的恩赐观点，养成了群众依赖思想，只愿使水不愿负担，影响了渠道的发展和渠道的保护，使水紊乱，纷争仍不时发生，防洪放淤尚未引起普遍的重视。（三）林牧管理机构不健全，有些地区禁山护林与群众当前生活的矛盾，没有适当的解决。有些地区勤务负担不公，伙养不得法，人畜拨工互助中，没有贯彻自愿等价的原则，以及兽医缺乏，均影响了牲畜的繁殖与发展。以上缺点偏向需要在一九四九年的生产运动中努力克服。
