Fighting Against Insect Pests
　　Jizhong Areas Eliminate Pests to Ensure Increased Production
　　[Special Dispatch from Our Newspaper] In order to guarantee the successful completion of this year's production increase plan, all special districts in Jizhong have been and are engaged in fierce struggles against various disasters, and have already achieved considerable results. During the spring sowing period, the Party, government, army, and people of Jizhong carried out emergency mobilization, organized nearly 10,000 cadres to go to the countryside to lead and assist the masses in launching a drought-resistant sowing campaign, completing 90 percent of the sowing of all autumn crops, and the planting plans for cotton and peanuts, achieving the first major victory in the battle for increased production. However, various disasters arose one after another. Subsequently, oil dragons were discovered in Anguo, aphids occurred in Jin County, armyworms were found in Shengfang, Anci, Baxian and other places, and armyworms, fire spiders, groundworms, grubs, mole crickets, and other pests occurred in some villages in Wuqing and Wenan, damaging seedlings. In order to eliminate these pests, the Jizhong Administrative Office sent a working group carrying insecticides to help farmers control pests. The CPC Wenan County Committee instructed all districts and villages to mobilize women and children to catch insects on one hand, and organize all labor and livestock to carry out shock sowing on the other. In seven days, the Seventh District, through the efforts of 1,120 people, caught and eliminated pests on 22 hectares of crops. During the insect catching in Wuqing County, 2,000 teachers and students from Yangcun Normal School and various higher and junior primary schools were mobilized, organized into eight large teams to carry out insect catching work, and put forward the slogans "Do not break seedlings, do not step on green plants" and "Catching insects is like fighting a fire." In two days, they caught and eliminated insect pests on more than 12 hectares of land, catching more than 155,000 insects. Local farms also introduced various methods in pest control technology, first teaching the cadres to learn, and then leading the masses. With the concerted efforts of everyone, the insect plagues in various places were successively eliminated. In early June, hailstorms occurred in 23 counties including Gaoyang and Daxing. The Jizhong District Party Committee and Administrative Office called for intensifying production for self-relief, immediately mobilizing and organizing the masses to replant late seedlings. Various farms, cooperatives, and trading companies immediately planned late seedling seeds in various places to help farmers replant. In mid-June, locusts occurred in approximately 31 counties in the Eighth, Tenth, and Eleventh Special Districts one after another, and cadres and farmers in various places rose up again to launch a locust-fighting campaign. The secretary of Anping County, the county head, and the director of the Women's Federation also personally went to the countryside to mobilize the masses to catch locusts. Other counties such as Suning and Wenan are also carrying out catching and beating. The district had no snow last winter, and this spring was dry and lacked rain. Insect pests will be a long-term and serious struggle, but with the continued efforts of the military and civilians throughout the district, they will be able to overcome disasters and strive to achieve the production increase plan.

　　向虫害作斗争
  　冀中各地灭虫保证增产
    【本报特讯】冀中各专区为保证今年增产计划的胜利完成，曾经和正在向各种灾害进行剧烈的斗争，并已获得不少成绩。在春季播种期中，冀中党政军民进行了紧急动员，组织近万干部下乡，领导和帮助群众展开了抗旱播种运动，完成了全部大秋作物百分之九十的播种，和棉花花生的种植计划，获得了增产战斗中的首次大捷。但各种灾害此起彼伏，接着安国发现油龙，晋县发生蚜虫，胜芳、安次、霸县等地发现黏虫，武清、文安等地部分村庄，发生黏虫、火蛛子、地蚕、＠螬、蝼蛄等害虫，使禾苗受到损害。为扑灭这些害虫，冀中行政公署曾派出一个工作组，携带杀虫药剂，帮助农民治虫。中共文安县委指示各区村，一面发动妇女儿童捕虫，一面组织一切劳畜力突击播种。七区在七天内，经一千一百二十人的努力，捕灭了二十二顷庄稼的害虫。武清县在捕虫中，动员了杨村师范及各高、初小学两千余学生教职员，组织成八个大队进行捕虫工作，提出：“不折苗、不踏青”、“捉虫如救火”的口号，两天中捕灭了一百八十余亩地的虫害，捉虫十五万五千余只。各地农场亦从杀虫技术上介绍各种办法，先教干部学会，再带领群众，在全体一致努力下，各地虫灾即先后捕灭。六月初旬，高阳、大兴等二十三个县中，又发生雹灾，冀中区党委行署号召加紧生产自救，立即动员与组织群众补种晚苗，各农场推进社和贸易公司立即在各地筹划晚苗种籽，帮助农民补种。六月中旬，八、十、十一等专区约三十一县又先后发生蝗蝻，各地干部和农民即又起来展开打蝗斗争。安平县书、县长、妇联主任等，亦亲自下乡发动群众捕蝗，其他各县如肃宁、文安等地亦正进行捕打。该区去冬未雪，今春天旱缺雨，虫害将是一个长期的严重的斗争，但在全区军民一致继续努力下，必能战胜灾害，争取增产计划的实现。
