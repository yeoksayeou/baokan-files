华北电业唐山分公司　积极节电查窃　已追回二十四万余度
    [Tangshan Electric] The North China Electric Power Tangshan Branch is responding to Comrade Bo Yibo of the North China Bureau of the CPC Central Committee's call for conservation by further developing electricity conservation movements inside and outside the factory and cracking down on electricity theft. Before liberation, the company's electricity loss figures were quite alarming. In 1937, for example, the total loss was 13,623,532 kilowatt-hours, with an average monthly loss of 1,135,300 kilowatt-hours, accounting for 16.21% of the total power supply. After liberation, although electricity theft gradually decreased, the amount of loss was still substantial. Statistics for January, February, March and April showed that, in addition to line losses, an average of 320,000 kilowatt-hours were lost each month. These losses are equivalent to the entire monthly electricity consumption of half of the Huaxin Textile Factory or one and a half Tangshan Locomotive Factories of the Ministry of Railways. The main reasons for such huge losses are, firstly, the waste of electricity (such as the widespread use of electric stoves by staff), and secondly, electricity theft. In order to recover the lost electricity, the company, in addition to solving the welfare problems of employees administratively, such as helping employees build stoves and buy coal, launched a mass movement of "Conserving Electricity and Loving the Factory, Investigating and Cracking Down on Electricity Theft" among all employees. Led by employee representatives, the branch alone handed over 113 electric stoves. A committee for investigating and cracking down on electricity theft and a persuasion group were also established to patrol, investigate and persuade in the city. As of May 20, 351 households stealing electricity had been discovered, with a stolen capacity of 165,449 kilowatts, and a recovered electricity volume of 241,578 kilowatt-hours, and recovered electricity fees of RMB 5,119,937 yuan. The numbers are quite significant. In order to further develop the electricity conservation movement inside and outside the factory and the struggle against electricity theft, the person in charge of the Tangshan Military Control Commission specially called on all government organizations, groups, factories, mines, and employees in the city on June 3 to strictly conserve electricity. The branch is also stepping up efforts to plug loopholes by upgrading electricity meters and other methods.

　　华电唐山分公司　积极节电查窃　已追回二十四万余度
    【唐山电】华北电业唐山分公司。响应中共中央华北局薄一波同志的节约号召，进一步开展厂内外的节电运动和反窃电斗争。该公司在解放以前，电度损失数字相当惊人，如三十七年全年即损失电一三六二三五三二度，平均每月损失一一三五三零零度，占供电总数的百分之十六·二一。解放后，偷电的现象虽然逐日减少，但损失数目仍然很大。一、二、三、四四个月统计，除了线路损失，每月还平均损失三十二万度电。这些损失，就等于半个华新纺织厂，一个半铁道部唐山机厂的全月用电。损失如此巨大的主要原因，一是浪费电力（如职员普遍用电炉等），一是偷盗电力。为了追回电度的损失，该分公司行政上除解决职工的福利问题，如帮助职工搭灶、买煤等困难外，并发起全体职工“节电爱厂、稽查窃电”的群众运动。在职工代表的带头下，仅分公司方面就交出一百十三个电炉。又成立了稽查窃电委员会与劝导小组，在市内巡逻稽查劝导。截至五月二十日，已查获窃电户三五一家，窃电容量一六五四四九千瓦，追补电度为二四一五七八度，追补电费人民币五一一九九三七元。数字相当巨大。为进一步开展厂内外的节电运动和反窃电斗争，唐山市军管会负责人特于六月三日号召全市各机关团体及各厂矿职工严格节约电力。该分公司并加紧以改造电力计算器等办法来堵塞漏洞。
