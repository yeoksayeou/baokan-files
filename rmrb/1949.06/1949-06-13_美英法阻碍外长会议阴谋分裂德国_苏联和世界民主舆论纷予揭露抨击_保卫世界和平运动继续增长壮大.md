　　The US, British and French Obstruction of Foreign Ministers' Conference Plots to Split Germany; Soviet Union and World Democratic Public Opinion Expose and Criticize; Movement to Defend World Peace Continues to Grow and Strengthen

　　This week of the Soviet, US, British, and French Foreign Ministers' Conference mainly discussed the second item on the agenda—the Berlin issue, and the third item—the issue of preparing a peace treaty with Germany, also began to be discussed. During the discussion of the Berlin issue, the foreign ministers held three secret meetings and three public meetings. The Berlin issue basically includes three questions: the restoration of a city government for the entire Berlin area, the reconstruction of the Berlin Four-Power Command, and the single currency issue. Like the issue of German unification, the Soviet side put forward positive and constructive opinions regarding the Berlin issue. The Soviet Union advocated establishing democratic Berlin municipal organs with considerable authority; advocated restoring the Berlin Four-Power Command on the basis of unanimous agreement; and advocated resolving the Berlin single currency issue in accordance with past agreements. However, the opinions of the US, Britain, and France were the opposite. In reality, they advocated establishing a puppet municipal organ under American control; although they verbally agreed to restore the Four-Power Command, they demanded the cancellation of the principle of unanimous agreement, which is the basis for the four countries to work together, effectively canceling the Four-Power Command. Not only that, later on, they didn't even mention so-called suggestions; they had already moved to blocking discussion of the Berlin currency issue, and even to blocking discussion of the issue of preparing a peace treaty with Germany.

　　The Foreign Ministers' Conference has been convened for three weeks, and people have a clearer understanding of the policies of the US, Britain, and France. In summary, their policy is to have the Foreign Ministers' Conference approve their establishment of a West German state in Germany, and approve their divisive activities that have broken four-power cooperation. Within the conference, they adopt such a policy; outside the conference, they continue to promote the division of Germany, do not fully lift restrictions on the Soviet occupation zone in Germany, and issue threats against the Soviet Union's insistence on resolving the German issue based on the principles of the Yalta and Potsdam agreements. At the end of last month, Acheson "telegraphed the Democratic leader of the US Senate from Paris, requesting prompt approval of the North Atlantic Treaty and armed assistance to Western Europe to enhance its position at the Foreign Ministers' Conference" (Associated Press). Senator Connally, Chairman of the US Senate Foreign Relations Committee, also declared on the 8th: "If the Paris Conference fails, the Senate will act quickly to approve the plan for military assistance to the signatories of the North Atlantic Treaty." (Agence France-Presse) However, the various actions of American imperialism have not only aroused exposure and criticism from the Soviet side, but also opposition from world democratic public opinion. The Standing Committee of the World Peace Congress has sent a telegram to the Foreign Ministers' Conference on behalf of hundreds of millions of people, "expressing their desire to see the Foreign Ministers' Conference resolve the German issue on the basis of genuine democratization of Germany." The American Slav Congress also sent a telegram to the Foreign Ministers' Conference, demanding that they "make the greatest efforts to reach a peaceful agreement on the German issue on the basis of the Yalta and Potsdam principles."

　　Peace-loving people around the world are holding a series of conferences to unite and fight for the defense of world peace. The Executive Committee meeting of the World Federation of Democratic Youth, which has approximately 60 million members, concluded on the evening of the 3rd after lasting six days. In addition to discussing preparations for the International Youth Festival to be held in Budapest starting on August 14, the meeting also issued a declaration calling on youth around the world to resolutely support and implement the resolutions of the World Peace Congress. The American youth organization "American Progressive Youth" held a conference in Washington on the 4th and 5th, with 265 representatives from 13 states attending. The meeting passed a resolution condemning the North Atlantic Treaty and issued a call to American youth to fight for peace and smash the North Atlantic Treaty. The Third National Congress of the French Women's Union, which has more than 2 million members, closed in Marseille on the 6th after a three-day meeting. On the afternoon of the 6th, a celebration rally attended by more than 100,000 people was held. During the representative congress meeting, thousands of women from all over France held a grand march to celebrate the representative congress, urging people along the way to participate in the struggle to defend peace. French women made a unanimous vow: "Women will never let their children be sent to fight an anti-Soviet war." In addition, the Free German Youth League also held its Third National Congress in Leipzig from the 1st to the 4th, and they declared that they demanded that German youth fight for a peaceful and unified Germany. The France-USSR Association convened the association's fourth congress under the slogan "Strengthening French-Soviet friendship to win peace."

　　The Austrian Left Socialist Party, established in March this year, held its first congress in Vienna on the 4th and 5th. Scharf, the former Secretary-General of the Socialist Party, who was expelled by right-wing Socialists for advocating working-class unity and is now the leader of the Left Socialist Party, strongly criticized the treacherous behavior of the right-wing Socialist leaders at the meeting. He called for uniting all truly socialist forces to fight against reactionary forces. The political resolution passed by the meeting pointed out the growth of the Left Socialist Party's strength in Austria and stated that the party would do its best to establish a united front of the entire Austrian workers' movement to oppose capitalist reaction and strive for the improvement of workers' lives. On the other hand, within the Austrian right-wing Socialist Party, many party members have become increasingly aware, and they have left the party one after another. In Vienna alone, more than 200 Socialist Party members have left the party and joined the Communist Party in the past three weeks.

　　The British Labour Party convened its 48th annual conference in Blackpool starting on the 6th. This meeting was convened after the Labour Party suffered successive defeats in the April county elections and the May municipal elections, and against the background of the increasingly deteriorating British economic situation during the Labour Party's four years in power. The characteristic of the annual conference was the growing dissatisfaction of ordinary Labour Party members with the Labour Party's reactionary leadership. Many Labour cabinet ministers were denounced as high-ranking "courtesans" and for doing "foolish things." At the same time, the large number of votes against expelling Zilliacus and supporting him in stating his opinions at the conference surprised the Labour Party leaders. The Labour Party ruling group, headed by Attlee, Morrison, Bevin, and Cripps, had to frantically resort to high-handed measures, prohibiting discussion of proposals opposing the Labour Party's reactionary policies at the meeting, and forcibly passing reactionary proposals such as continuing to freeze wages and deceptive documents such as the so-called "Labour Believes in Britain."

　　Recently, in the United States, the New York stock market, which is highly sensitive to commerce, has fallen three times in a row since May 31, with an average decline of one to four US dollars per share, falling to the lowest point since March last year. This reflects the further deterioration of the US economic situation. The reason for this stock price decline, according to general Wall Street observers, is that stockholders fear that the sudden decline in consumer purchasing power will continue. Originally, since mid-May, New York newspapers have revealed that the income of the overwhelming majority of people is constantly declining. Government tax revenues are as much as ten billion US dollars less than expected. Materials from mid-May showed that the United States' trade had decreased by 14 percent in recent months. Due to the decline in people's purchasing power, wholesale prices in the United States fell by 5 percent in the year before May. Investors generally hesitate due to the deterioration of the economic situation. As a result, the amount of investment in the same period has decreased by 30 percent. The continuous decline in people's purchasing power and the shrinking market have forced American bosses to reduce production. It is estimated that industrial production has decreased by 10 percent since last October. Rudyck, the editor-in-chief of the Wall Street Journal of Commerce, said that industrial production will fall by 30 to 40 percent by early spring next year compared to the post-war peak. Accompanying the decline in production is the increasing number of unemployed. The figures recently released by the United Electrical, Radio and Machine Workers of America indicate that the number of unemployed in the United States is currently more than 5 million. However, this number does not include the more than 12 million people who only work part-time each week. The continuous deterioration of the US economic situation is the reason why Truman and others are trying their best to implement the so-called "development of backward countries" plan in order to seize the markets of these countries.

### 美英法阻碍外长会议阴谋分裂德国  苏联和世界民主舆论纷予揭露抨击  保卫世界和平运动继续增长壮大

　　美英法阻碍外长会议阴谋分裂德国
    苏联和世界民主舆论纷予揭露抨击
    保卫世界和平运动继续增长壮大
    苏美英法外长会议的这一周，主要是讨论议程的第二项——柏林问题，议程的第三项——准备对德和约问题，亦已开始讨论。在讨论柏林问题时，各外长曾举行了三次秘密会议，三次公开会议。柏林问题基本上包括三个问题，即恢复全柏林范围的市政府、重建柏林四国司令部与单一货币问题。和德国统一问题一样，关于柏林问题，苏联方面提出了积极的、有建设性的意见。苏联主张建立民主的、有相当职权的柏林市政机关；主张在一致协议的基础上恢复柏林四国司令部；主张按照过去的协议解决柏林单一货币问题。可是，美英法的意见却相反。在实际上，他们主张建立一个在美国控制之下的傀儡市政机关；他们虽然在口头上同意恢复四国司令部，但却要求取消四国共同工作的基础——一致协议的原则，实际上是取消四国司令部。不仅如此，在稍后的时候，他们连所谓建议也不提了，他们已经进到阻挡讨论柏林货币问题，甚至进到阻挡讨论准备对德和约问题的地步。
    外长会议集会已经三周，人们对于美英法的政策已经看得比较清楚了，概括地说，他们的政策就是要外长会议批准他们在德国建立西德国家，批准他们使四国合作破裂的分裂活动而已。在会内，他们采取这样的政策；在会外，他们继续推行分裂德国的活动，不完全撤消对德境苏占区的限制，并对苏联坚持以雅尔塔、波茨坦协议的原则解决德国问题的立场发出恐吓之词。艾奇逊曾于上月底自巴黎“致电美国参院民主党领袖，要求迅速批准北大西洋公约及对于西欧之武装援助，以增强其在外长会议中之地位”（合众社）。美参院外委会主席康纳利亦于八日宣称：“巴黎会议如果失败，参院将赶快行动，批准军事援助北大西洋公约签字国的计划。”（法新社）但是，美帝国主义的种种作为，不仅引起苏联方面的揭露和抨击，而且也引起世界民主舆论的反对。世界拥护和平大会常设委员会，已代表数亿人民致电外长会议“表示愿见外长会议，在德国真正民主化的基础上解决德国问题”。美籍斯拉夫人大会亦致电外长会议，要求他们“作最大的努力，在雅尔塔与波茨坦原则的基础上达到关于德国问题的和平协议”。
    世界爱好和平的人民，正在召开一系列的会议，为保卫世界和平而团结奋斗。拥有约六千万会员的世界民主青年联盟的执委会会议，在历时六日之后，已于三日晚结束。会议除了讨论定于八月十四日开始在布达佩斯举行的国际青年节的筹备工作以外，并发表宣言，号召全世界青年坚决支持和执行世界拥护和平大会的决议。美国青年团体“美国进步青年社”，于四、五两日在华盛顿召开大会，与会者有十三州的代表二百六十五人。会议通过了斥责北大西洋公约决议，并向美国青年发出为争取和平及粉碎北大西洋公约而斗争的号召。拥有二百余万会员的法国妇女联盟的第三届全国代表大会，开会三日，已于六日在马赛闭幕。六日下午，举行了有十余万群众参加的庆祝大会。在代表大会会议过程中，有来自法国各地的数千名妇女，举行了庆祝代表大会的大进军，她们沿途敦促人民参加保卫和平的斗争。法国妇女们发出了一致的誓言：“妇女永远不让她们的孩子被送去进行反苏战争。”此外，自由德国青年联盟亦于一日至四日在莱比锡举行第三届全国代表大会，他们宣言要求德国青年为和平与统一的德国而斗争。法苏协会则在“加强法苏友谊来赢得和平”的口号下，召开了该协会的第四届代表大会。
    今年三月成立的奥地利左翼社会党，于四、五两日在维也纳举行第一届代表大会。因主张工人阶级团结而被社会党右翼分子开除的前社会党总书记、现为左翼社会党领袖夏尔夫，在会上力斥社会党右翼领袖的叛卖行为，他号召团结一切真正社会主义的力量，进行反对反动势力的斗争。会议所通过的政治决议，指出了左翼社会党力量在奥国的增长，并提出该党将竭力建立奥国整个工人运动的统一阵线，以反对资本主义的反动及争取工人生活的改善，另一方面，在奥国右翼社会党内，许多党员已日益觉醒，他们纷纷脱离该党，仅在最近三周内，只维也纳一地，就有二百余名社会党员脱离该党而参加了共产党。
    英国工党于六日起在布拉克普尔召开第四十八届年会。这次会议是在工党于四月郡选及五月市选中接连遭受失败之后，在工党当政四年中英国经济形势日益恶化的情况下召开的。年会的特点是一般工党党员对工党反动领导机关不满情绪的增长，许多工党的内阁部长被斥为高等“歌妓”和在作“愚蠢之事”。同时，反对开除齐里亚库斯与支持他在大会上申述意见的票数之多，使得工党党魁们为之惊讶。以艾德礼、摩里逊、贝文、克利浦斯为首的工党统治集团，不得不慌张地施用高压手段，禁止会中讨论反对工党反动政策的议案，并强迫通过了继续冻结工资等反动议案及所谓“劳工相信英国”等欺骗文件。
    最近以来，在美国，对商业素具敏感的纽约股票，从五月三十一日起，已连续三次下跌，平均每股下降一至四美元，已跌落到去年三月以来的最低点，这反映出美国经济情况的进一步恶化。这次股票跌价的原因，据华尔街一般观察家承认，是股票持有人害怕消费者购买力的突然下降，将要继续下去。本来，自五月中旬以来，纽约报纸已经透露，占压倒多数的人民的收入正在不断下降。政府税收较预期的要少十亿美元之巨。上月中旬的材料显示，近几月来美国的贸易已减少了百分之十四。由于人民购买力的下降，美国的批发物价，在五月以前的一年中，下降了百分之五。投资家眼看到经济情况的恶劣，一般都裹足不前。结果，同一时期的投资额已降低了百分之三十。人民购买力的不断下降，市场的日趋缩小，使美国大老板们不得不减少生产。据估计，自去年十月以来，工业生产已降低了百分之十。华尔街的机关报商务日报主编鲁迪克说，工业生产明年初春将较战后最高峰下降百分之三十到四十。伴随生产下降而来的，是日益增多的失业人数。美国电汽工人工会最近所发表的数字，表明美国目前失业的人数是五百余万。但是，这个数字并不包括每周只作部分工作的一千二百余万人在内。美国经济情况的不断恶化，就是杜鲁门等极力要实行所谓“开发落后国家”计划，以夺取这些国家的市场的原因。
