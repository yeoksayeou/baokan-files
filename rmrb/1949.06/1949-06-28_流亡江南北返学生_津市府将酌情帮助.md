Students Returning North from Exile in Jiangnan
　　Tianjin Municipal Government to Provide Appropriate Assistance
　　[This newspaper's report] Since the successive liberation of major cities in Jiangnan, students of Northeast and North China origin, who had previously been coerced into exile in Jiangnan by the Kuomintang reactionary government, have been returning to Northeast and North China one after another. Some of them are experiencing financial difficulties and lack travel expenses, requesting assistance from the People's Government in Tianjin along the way. In order to enable these exiled students to return to their hometowns or schools as soon as possible, and to be able to study or find employment, the North China People's Government has instructed the Tianjin Municipal People's Government to investigate and verify the facts, and provide assistance with travel expenses, enrollment, etc., according to the different circumstances.
