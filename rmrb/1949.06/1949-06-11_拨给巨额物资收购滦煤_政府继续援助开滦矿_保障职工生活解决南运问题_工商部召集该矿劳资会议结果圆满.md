　　[News from this newspaper] In response to the requests of the Kailuan Mining Bureau and the workers' union, the Ministry of Industry and Commerce of the North China People's Government convened a conference of labor and management representatives from Kailuan from June 4th to 6th to discuss how the government could continue to help Kailuan Coal Mine overcome its difficulties, and to plan the southward transportation of Kailuan coal to Shanghai, Qingdao, and other places. With the exception of the coal price cost calculation, which requires further study, satisfactory agreements have been reached on other issues. Attendees at the meeting included Minister Yao Yilin of the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, Deputy Minister Xu Daben of the Public Enterprise Department, Zhang Yifei, Minister of Coal and Iron of the North China Trading Company, Li Nansheng, Manager of the Pingjin Coal and Iron Company, Yang Wenqin, Military Representative of the Resident Mine Branch, Wang Lin, Military Representative of the Resident Mining Area, Yang Zhan, Deputy Director of the Kailuan Trade Union Federation, worker representatives Cao Xingshun, Wang Zhenming, Li Yunting, Liu Cun, Liu Jingzhi, Yu Mingde, General Manager of the mine, Mr. Peillier (British), Wei Chun, head of the mining area, and more than ten other people. At the beginning of the meeting, Minister Yao first explained the government's plan to continue to assist Kailuan in the future. He pointed out that in the past, in order to help Kailuan restore production, the People's Government had successively loaned Kailuan 750 million yuan in People's Currency from the People's Bank, and the North China Trade Corporation had exchanged more than 80,000 bags of flour, 12 million catties of miscellaneous grains, and 1.4 million kiln woods for Kailuan coal, which was accumulated in the hands of the government, so that Kailuan could turnover, and Kailuan employees could partially receive their salaries. At present, Shanghai and Qingdao have been liberated, and Kailuan coal can be transported southward, but because the southward transportation of northern grain may be greatly reduced in the future, the food difficulties of Kailuan employees still exist. In order to enable Kailuan to overcome difficulties and quickly restore production, and to ensure the livelihood of Kailuan employees, the government is willing to assist Kailuan in further resolving the existing problems. Minister Yao then put forward the following plan to assist Kailuan: (1) In order to ensure the livelihood of employees, the North China Trading Company will exchange coal for materials equivalent to 150,000 bags of flour from Kailuan every month. This amount of flour is the total amount of physical objects that Kailuan must pay to its employees in their monthly wages. (2) Kailuan's old debts to employees for the physical part of their wages—500,000 bags of flour, of which it is estimated that about 300,000 bags of flour tickets are still in the hands of workers, and Kailuan is currently unable to repay the employees. The government proposes that the North China Trading Company purchase Kailuan coal with materials equivalent to 50,000 bags of flour per month, so that Kailuan can repay its old physical debts to employees within six months. (3) Kailuan's old wage arrears of 900 million yuan will be re-loaned 450 million yuan by the People's Bank of China, and the remaining half will be raised by the mine itself. (4) Due to the continuous assistance to Kailuan in the past, the government now has a backlog of 500,000 tons of Kailuan coal. In the future, it will still exchange coal for materials at about 100,000 tons per month. Therefore, the government proposes that in the future, the coal exported from Qinhuangdao should be shared equally by the North China Trade Corporation and the Kailuan Coal Mine. Kailuan should provide various conveniences for the North China Trade Corporation to use Kailuan's Qinhuangdao coal yard and wharf. (5) Kailuan coal transported southward to Shanghai and Qingdao will not be subject to export tax. (6) The government will dispatch a general military representative stationed in Kailuan to unify the leadership of the military representatives stationed in Kailuan by the military control committees in various places, so as to strengthen ties with the Kailuan mine, understand the situation, supervise production, and supervise the rational distribution of the government's assistance to Kailuan. After Minister Yao's speech, Kailuan worker representatives Li Yunting and others spoke successively, expressing their great gratitude for the People's Government's concern for the lives of workers. They also hoped that the meeting could achieve satisfactory results, so that the lives of more than 50,000 Kailuan employees could be effectively guaranteed. They also stated that if the difficulties in workers' lives can be effectively resolved, Kailuan employees will participate in production with great enthusiasm, so that output can be rapidly increased, ensuring supplies to North China and Beijing, Shanghai, Hangzhou, and Qingdao. Subsequently, Peillier, General Manager of Kailuan Coal Mine, spoke: He first expressed his gratitude to the government for its support to Kailuan, and expressed his willingness to accept the government's first, second, third, and fifth assistance measures to Kailuan. Regarding the fourth method, he believed it was fair and reasonable, and raised some specific issues, such as the formula for calculating coal prices and related railway and sea transportation issues, and hoped that decisions could also be made at this meeting. Mr. Peillier welcomed the government's dispatch of a general military representative to Kailuan to unify the leadership of the military representatives of Kailuan institutions in various places and to closely contact Kailuan. The meeting was temporarily adjourned at this point. According to Minister Yao's proposal, representatives from the government, the workers' union, and the mining bureau formed a group meeting to study the specific issues raised by Mr. Peillier. After several consultations, an agreement was reached on transportation issues. On the evening of the 6th, a plenary meeting was reconvened, and Minister Yao made a brief summary, and with the unanimous consent of all participants, announced that the above-mentioned six government proposals had been agreed upon by both the Kailuan Mining Bureau and the worker representatives and would be implemented immediately after the meeting. As for the issue of the Kailuan coal price calculation formula that has not yet been resolved, it will be discussed separately in the future. At this point, the meeting was adjourned. (Hong)

　　拨给巨额物资收购滦煤
  　政府继续援助开滦矿
    保障职工生活解决南运问题
  　工商部召集该矿劳资会议结果圆满
    【本报讯】根据开滦矿务局与职工会的要求，华北人民政府工商部于六月四日至六日召集开滦劳资双方举行会议，商讨今后政府如何继续帮助开滦煤矿克服困难，及筹划滦煤南运上海、青岛等问题。除煤价成本计算尚待进一步研究外，其他问题已达成圆满协议。出席该会者有工商部姚依林部长、公营企业部徐达本副部长、华北贸易总公司煤铁部长张翼飞、平津煤铁公司李南生经理、驻矿分局军事代表杨文钦、驻矿区军事代表王林、开滦职工总会副主任杨展、职工代表曹兴顺、王振明，李云亭、刘存、刘敬之、矿方总经理余明德、裴利耶（英人）、矿区主管魏肫等十余人。会议开始，首由姚部长说明政府今后继续援助开滦的方案，他指出：过去人民政府为帮助开滦恢复生产，曾先后由人民银行贷给开滦人民券七亿五千万元，并由华北贸总以面粉八万多袋，杂粮一千二百万斤，窑木一百四十万根交换开滦煤，把这些煤积压在政府手里，使开滦得以周转，使开滦员工薪金得以部分发放。目前上海、青岛业已解放，滦煤可以南运，但由于今后南粮北运可能大为减少，因此开滦员工粮食困难，仍然存在。为使开滦得以克服困难，迅速恢复生产，使开滦员工生活获得保障，政府愿意协助开滦进一步解决现存各问题。姚部长继即提出援助开滦的方案如下：（一）为了保障职工生活，由华北贸易总公司每月以相当于十五万袋面粉的物资向开滦换煤。此项面粉数额即为开滦须付给职工每月工资中实物部分的全部。（二）开滦旧欠职工工资实物部分——面粉五十万袋，其中估计尚在工人手中的面票约为三十万袋，开滦现无法偿还职工，政府提议由华北贸易总公司每月以相当于五万袋面粉的物资收购开滦煤，以使开滦得于六个月内还清对职工实物旧欠。（三）开滦旧欠工资现款九亿元由中国人民银行再贷款四亿五千万元，其余一半由矿方自行筹还。（四）由于过去不断援助开滦的结果，政府现积压开滦煤五十万吨，以后每月以实物换煤，尚在十万吨左右，因此，政府提出今后由秦皇岛外销之煤，由华北贸总与开滦煤矿各占一半，开滦对于华北贸总使用开滦秦皇岛煤场及码头，应给以各种便利。（五）滦煤南运上海、青岛，不征出口税。（六）由政府派遣驻开滦总军事代表，以统一各地军管会所派驻开滦军事代表的领导，以便加强与开滦矿方联系，了解情况，监督生产，监督政府给予开滦的援助得以合理分配。姚部长发言后，开滦职工代表李云亭等相继发言，对于人民政府关怀职工生活，表示极大谢意。并希望此次会议能够得到圆满结果，使开滦五万多职工生活获得确切保障。并表示职工生活困难获得确切解决，开滦职工必将以极大的热情参加生产，使产量迅速提高，保证对华北和京、沪、杭、青各地的供应。继由开滦煤矿总经理裴利耶发言：他首先表示感激政府对于开滦的扶助，对政府所提的一、二、三、五项援助开滦极愿接受。对于第四项办法，认为是公平合理的，并提出一些具体问题，如象计算煤价的公式和有关铁道海运等问题，希望也能在这次会上做出决定。对于政府向开滦派出总军事代表以统一各地开滦机构军事代表的领导，并密切与开滦联系，裴氏表示欢迎。会议至此暂告休会。根据姚部长的提议，由政府、职工会和矿务局各派代表组织小组会研讨裴利耶所提出的具体问题，经数度磋商后，其中关于运输问题已获协议。六日晚重新召集全体会议，由姚部长作简单的总结，并在全体一致同意下宣布上述政府的六条建议，已经开滦矿务局及职工代表双方同意，于会后立即实施。至于尚未能解决的开滦煤价计算公式问题，则于今后另行研讨，至此，会议宣告闭幕。（洪）
