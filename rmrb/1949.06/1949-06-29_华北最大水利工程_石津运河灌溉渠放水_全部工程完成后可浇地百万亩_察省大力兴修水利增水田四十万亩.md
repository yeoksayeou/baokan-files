　　[Shijiazhuang Electric] The first phase of North China's largest water conservancy project—the Shijin Canal irrigation ditch, capable of irrigating 200,000 mu of land—has been successfully completed through the joint efforts of all staff members of the Shijin Canal Irrigation Project Office and local farmers. A grand water release ceremony was held in Huangbizhuang, Huolu on June 12. Responsible comrades from Shijiazhuang City, Jianping Prefecture, and Huolu County all attended. Amidst the sounds of musical ensembles and celebratory cannons, the ribbon was cut and water was released, as the torrential flow of the Hutuo River surged into the canal. Project personnel, farmers, and guests on both banks were overjoyed. This section of the project utilizes the diversion route of the Shijin Canal, which was originally excavated by the Japanese invaders, and includes four newly dug branch canals, totaling 35 kilometers in length. It can irrigate 200,000 mu of land in 57 villages in Shijiazhuang City and Huolu County. Construction began in November of last year. Local people enthusiastically participated, completing the 35-kilometer canal in just 20 days, excavating 230,000 cubic meters of earth. After detailed design and material preparation throughout the winter and spring, the construction of canal structures began in the second half of March this year. By the first half of May, in less than two months, 113 structures, including a 28-meter-long aqueduct made with foreign cement, highway bridges, and diversion sluices, stone bridges of various sizes, and a temporary water barrier of 390 meters of wooden piles and bound bundles, along with 47 large, medium, and small sluice gates, were completed, using a total of 93,000 workdays and costing 15,000 dan of rice in project expenses. The vast majority of workers and farmers demonstrated great enthusiasm. To overcome the 25,000 cubic meters of silt in the tunnel, cadres and workers immersed themselves in waist-deep water, persisting in their work for 20 days and nights. Under the responsible guidance of engineers, each contracted work team was able to complete their work quickly and according to standards, thus ensuring that the project was relatively solid and durable. According to responsible comrades from the project office and Wang Chengzhou, supervisor of the North China People's Government and chief engineer of the Canal Irrigation Project Office: In order to transform the natural environment of North China, which experiences drought in nine out of ten years, the Shijin Canal irrigation ditch will be extended further east, passing through Gaocheng, Jin County, Shen County, and Shulu, to achieve the plan of irrigating one million mu. This section of the project is only the beginning. In the future, it will be necessary to build foreign cement dams and even large-scale reservoirs. It is reported that the soil in this area is most suitable for cotton cultivation. It is expected that after the completion of this great project, large-scale cotton fields will be planted, and the supply of raw materials for the textile industry in North China can be effectively guaranteed. It will also play a significant role in the overall development of industrial and agricultural production, changing the self-sufficient agricultural production, and making it subordinate to industrial production.
　　The Shijin Canal was originally constructed by the Japanese invaders, starting in 1941, with the plan to extend from Huangbizhuang through Huolu, Shijiazhuang, to Xiaofanzhen in Wuqiang, entering the Ziya River to Tianjin. The purpose was to divide our anti-Japanese base areas and plunder the wealth of our people. During the construction, they conscripted laborers, extorted contributions, massacred the masses, and raped women, causing the masses to hate them to the bone. Under the heroic destructive struggle of the masses, the enemy's plan ultimately failed. After liberation, the canal became the people's. The People's Government transformed it into a people's irrigation project, and the people on both sides of the canal turned their hatred for the canal into love and their destruction into active construction.

    【石家庄电】华北最大水利工程——石津运河灌溉渠，第一阶段浇地二十万亩的工程，在石津运河灌溉工程处全体职工与当地农民共同努力下，已胜利竣工，于六月十二日在获鹿黄壁庄隆重举行放水典礼。石家庄市、建屏专署、获鹿县负责同志均赶往参加。在鼓乐合奏礼炮齐鸣声中举行剪彩放水，滹沱河巨流从进水闸口汹涌流入河身。两岸工程人员、农民及来宾莫不欢欣鼓舞。该段工程是沿用日寇开凿的石津运河的导水路，并新凿四道支渠，全长三十五公里，可灌溉石家庄市、获鹿县等五十七个村的地二十万亩。自去年十一月开始动工，当地群众热情参加，只二十天即完成渠道三十五公里，挖土二十三万公方，经去冬今春详细设计及材料准备后，今年三月后半月开始渠道建筑物施工，至五月前半月，不到两个月时间，完成洋灰二十八米大渡糟、公路桥梁分水闸，砌石桥，大小共一百一十三件建筑物，并筑木桩沉捆三百九十米临时拦水坝一个，大、中、小闸门四十七个，共用工九万三千多，工程费一万五千石米。绝大部分的工人、农民都表现了高度热情，为了克服隧道中的二万五千方淤泥，干部工人浸在没腰深的水里，坚持了二十昼夜的工作，各包工小组在工程师负责指导下也能按照标准迅速完成工作，因此工程比较坚固耐久。据该处负责同志及华北人民政府监察委员兼运河灌溉工程处总工程师王承周谈：为改造华北十年九旱的自然环境，石津运河灌溉渠将更向东延长，经藁城、晋县、深县、束鹿等地，达到完成灌溉百万亩的计划。这一段工程还仅仅是一个开始，今后需要修洋灰拦河坝甚至蓄水库大工程。据悉这一带土质，最宜植棉，预计这一伟大工程完成后，广植棉田，华北纺织业原料供给上可以得到有力的保证，对整个发展工农业生产，改变自给自足的农业生产，使之服从于工业生产一点上，也会起很大作用。
    按石津运河是日寇占领时期从一九四一年开始修建的，计划从黄壁庄经获鹿、石家庄、到武强小樊镇入子牙河到天津，目的在分割我抗日根据地，掠夺我区人民财富。修建中，抓夫摊派，杀戮群众，强奸妇女，群众恨之入骨，在群众英勇的破坏斗争下，敌人计划终归破产。而解放后，运河变成人民的了，人民政府将它变成人民灌溉工程，两岸群众也就把对运河的仇恨变成爱护，破坏变成积极建筑了。
