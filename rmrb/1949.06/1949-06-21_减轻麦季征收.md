Short Essay

    North China is already in an environment of peaceful construction, and the purchasing power of farmers urgently needs to be improved, and the burden on farmers should also be reduced; however, the victory of the People's Liberation War on a national scale still requires a certain amount of support from the people of North China. The North China People's Government, taking into account the difficulties of the people's poor summer harvest, decided to appropriately reduce the summer levy task. This is a correct and brilliant measure. Due to the lack of snow last winter and severe drought this spring in North China, except for some areas in Hebei-Shandong-Henan, Hebei East, Taihang, and Taiyue, which had one or two thorough rains, there was very little rain in vast areas, especially in central and southern Hebei; in addition to the drought, some areas also suffered from insect pests, frost, hail, wind and other disasters, affecting more than 80 counties. Over the past few months, through the government's call to mobilize and overcome the disaster, actively leading farmers to open rivers, dig wells, repair canals, plant seeds, replant, and capture insect pests, great remedies have been achieved. However, this year's wheat harvest is still significantly lower than last year, and the lives of farmers have been affected to a certain extent. Therefore, in addition to calling on the entire region to practice thrift, distributing loan grain to some severely affected areas, and vigorously organizing mass production, the People's Government has also decided to reduce this year's original summer agricultural tax task according to the severity of the disaster in various places. This is in line with the principle of taking into account both military needs and people's livelihood, and both war and construction. It is precisely to solve the immediate difficulties of farmers and promote the enthusiasm of farmers for active production.
    In order to implement the spirit of tax reduction and ensure that the disaster-stricken households in the disaster-stricken areas can receive the due reduction and exemption, leaders at all levels must be conscientious and responsible, follow the mass line, conduct in-depth investigations of the disaster situation, and determine the tax reduction standards for evaluation and reduction work.
    In the evaluation and reduction work, appropriate consideration should also be given to the families of revolutionary martyrs, military personnel, and workers who have suffered from disasters, so that the commanders and fighters on the front lines and the staff in the rear can be comforted. Care should also be given to the disaster-stricken households of the elderly, weak, disabled, and those with no labor force who have difficulties in life. In order to do a good job in tax reduction, we must oppose the egalitarian method of distribution and the bureaucratic style of not investigating or studying.
    This year's summer harvest has been significantly reduced, but the largest part of North China's agricultural income is in the autumn. Therefore, we hope that party and government workers at all levels will conscientiously lead the various tasks of agricultural production such as flood prevention, weeding, fertilization, and pest control, and strive to ensure a bumper autumn harvest or a better autumn harvest this year. Then the losses of the poor wheat harvest will not be difficult to compensate, and the appropriate reduction of the burden on farmers will not affect the support for the Liberation War - this can truly reflect Chairman Mao's instructions: "Develop the economy, ensure supply."

    减轻麦季征收
    华北已经处于和平建设的环境，农民的购买力急待提高，农民负担也应减轻；但人民解放战争在全国范围的胜利还须华北人民的一定的支持，华北人民政府  了照顾人民夏季歉收的困难，决定适当减轻夏征任务，这是一个正确的英明的措施。华北区因去冬少雪，入春亢旱，除冀鲁豫、冀东、太行、太岳，部分地区下过一两次透雨外，广大地区下雨很少，尤以冀中、冀南较为严重；旱灾之外，部分地区又发生虫、霜、雹、风等灾，受灾县份约八十余县。数月来经过人民政府号召动员战胜灾荒，积极领导农民开河、凿井、修渠、点种、补种与捕捉虫害等，已得到很大补救。但今年麦收仍比去年减产不少，农民生活受到一定影响。因此人民政府除了号召全区厉行节约，部分受灾严重地区发放贷粮，并大力组织群众生产之外，又决定将今年原定农业税夏征任务，根据各地受灾轻重，分别予以减征。这是适合于军需与民生兼顾，战争与建设兼顾的方针的，正是为了解决农民眼前困难，而推动农民积极生产的热忱的。
    如何贯彻减征精神，使受灾地区的受灾户确能得到应有的减免，必须各级领导上认真负责，走群众路线，深入调查灾情，确定减征标准进行评减工作。
    在评减工作中并须适当照顾受灾的烈属军属工属，使在前线的指战员与后方的工作人员得到安慰。对于老弱残废无劳力的生活困难之受灾户，亦须予以照顾。为了把减征工作做好，必须反对平均主义的分配方法与不调查不研究的官僚主义作风。
    今年夏收减产不少，但华北区农业收入的最大部分是在秋季。因此，我们希望各级党政工作人员认真领导防洪、锄草、补肥、除虫等农业生产的各项工作，争取并保证今年有一个秋季丰收或较好的秋收，则麦季歉收的损失不难补偿，农民负担的适当减轻亦不致影响对解放战争的支援——这才能真正体现毛主席所指示的：“发展经济，保证供给”的方针。
