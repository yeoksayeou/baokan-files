　　Improving Quality and Selling More with Small Profits: Handan Textile Industry Develops
　　[Jinan Telegram] After the liberation of Tianjin and Beijing, a large number of imported fabrics flowed into Handan City from February, which once slowed down the strip cloth market in the city. As a result, small cotton textile factories in the city had doubts about future development. At that time, the Municipal Bureau of Industry and Commerce, after studying various data, believed that in the current situation, improving quality and selling more with small profits could still lead to some development. Therefore, it proposed a business policy that meets the needs of the masses for the cotton textile industry: improving quality and selling more with small profits. Many cotton textile factories actively responded, changed to weaving white native cloth and blue, gray, and other colored cloths. Facts have proved that not only are sales smooth, but also certain profits are obtained. Yong Sheng Factory does not use inferior thread, but uses high-quality materials and strengthens technical research, so the quality has been greatly improved, and as a result, there are not enough goods to sell. Liqun Factory weaves finely and increases the weight of the cloth, and there is also no stock. A certain profit was obtained in one month. When Yong Sheng opened its doors in February, it had five machines and a circulating capital of only 52,000 yuan, equivalent to 3,420 catties of rice. Now it has earned about 4,000 catties of rice. The same is true for Liqun; at the beginning, the capital was 130,000 yuan, worth about 8,060 catties of rice, and now the profit is 342,200 yuan, worth 11,000 catties of rice, earning 2,940 catties.

　　提高质量薄利广销　邯郸布业有发展
    【冀南电】平津解放后，自二月开始大批洋布流入邯郸市，使该市条布行市曾一度迟滞，因而该市小型棉织业工厂对今后发展发生疑虑。当时，市工商局综合各种资料研究结果，认为在现在情况下提高质量，薄利广销，仍可有一定发展；因之便对棉织业提出了切合群众需要的经营方针，提高质量、薄利广销。很多棉织业工厂积极响应，改织白土布及青、蓝、灰色等布，事实证明不仅销路顺畅，且获一定利润。永胜工厂一不用次等线子，使用高等质料，加强技术研究，质量即大为提高，结果，货物不足出售。利群工厂精织细纺，布匹重量增加，亦无存货。一个月中即获一定利润。永胜二月开门时机子五张，流动资金只五万二千元，折米三千四百二十斤，现在约赚米四千斤。利群也是如此；开始资金十三万元，约值米八千零六十多斤，现利达三十四万二千多元，值米一万一千多斤，赚两千九百四十多斤。
