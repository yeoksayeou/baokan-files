　　Preparatory Meeting of Three Teacher and Staff Groups in Beiping
  　Preparing for the Establishment of a College and University Teacher and Staff Union
    Comrade Peng Zhen Pointed Out that the Organization Should Participate in the All-China Federation of Trade Unions
    [Our Newspaper] The Beiping Higher Education Institutions Teaching and Research Union, the Teacher and Staff Union Preparatory Committee, and the New Culture Construction Association (New Democracy Cultural Construction Association) Preparatory Committee held a joint meeting at 3:00 PM yesterday (the 11th) in the office of the Beiping Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, in preparation for the establishment of the Beiping College and University Teacher and Staff Union. Present at the meeting were Wu Han, Qian Duansheng, Luo Changpei, Fei Qing, Yang Zonghan, and Chai Degeng from the Teaching and Research Union; Tan Yuan＠, Lou Bangyan, Zhao Chengxin, Wang Bin, Wei Zhen, Wang Xu, Lu Niansu, Zhang Lanqing, Zhao Lian, and Huang Youshen from the Teacher and Staff Union Preparatory Committee; and Chen Dingmin, Chen Mingshao, Xu Jingqi, Qiu Kean, Yu Xiaoqian, Cai Shanchang, Yin Shaohong, Deng Aimin, and Yang Guizhen from the New Culture Construction Association Preparatory Committee, totaling twenty-five people. Comrade Peng Zhen, Secretary of the Beiping Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, was also invited to attend. First, Tan Yuan＠ announced the opening of the meeting and proposed Wu Han of the Teaching and Research Union as the chairman. Following Chairman Wu Han's report on the significance of the meeting, representatives from each group spoke successively, all feeling that the current organizations of professors, teaching assistants, and staff in various colleges and universities are scattered and overlapping. In order to enhance unity among them, they unanimously agreed to jointly initiate the preparation for the city's College and University Teacher and Staff Union by the three groups present. Discussions were then held on its organizational nature, composition, and preparatory steps. Qian Duansheng, Fei Qing, Chen Dingmin, Zhao Chengxin, Xu Jingqi, Chen Mingshao, Zhang Lanqing, Wu Han, Tan Yuan＠, Zhao Lian, and others spoke successively. Regarding the nature of the union, everyone believed that it should be an organization transitioning to the establishment of a trade union. Comrade Peng Zhen also explained that "intellectual workers, teachers and staff are part of the working class, and its joint organization should participate in the All-China Federation of Trade Unions in the future." Regarding the principle of voluntary membership, there was a heated debate at the meeting. Finally, everyone unanimously agreed that the ultimate goal of this organization should be to strive for the participation of all teachers and staff in various colleges and universities, but those who individually do not wish to participate should not be forced. As for reactionary elements who are generally recognized as ineligible for participation, they should be refused membership. Regarding the organizational form and preparatory steps, after a preliminary exchange of views, it was unanimously agreed that each college and university should have a teacher and staff union, and the city's general college and university teacher and staff union should be organized on this basis. At the same time, it was decided that each school's professors' association, teaching assistants' association, and staff association should each send representatives to form a preparatory committee to be responsible for its preparatory work. It was also decided that the heads of the three groups attending yesterday's meeting would be the natural members of the preparatory committee, and Wu Han, Xu Jingqi, and Tan Yuan＠ were elected as conveners for the next meeting, responsible for inviting representatives from units that did not attend to participate in the preparatory work. It was also decided that the first preparatory committee meeting would be held at 9:00 AM next Sunday (the 19th) at Peking University's Zimintang Hall. Each participating representative will return to their respective schools to widely solicit the opinions of colleagues and bring them to the meeting for further discussion and decision-making.

　　平市三教职员团体开联席会
  　筹组专科以上教职联
    彭真同志指出该组织应参加总工会
    【本报讯】北平各院校教研联、教职联筹委会、新文建（新民主主义文化建设协会）筹委会等三团体为筹备成立北平市专科以上院校教职员联合会，昨（十一）日下午三时假中共北平市委会办公室举行联席会议，出席教研联吴晗、钱端升、罗常培、费青、杨宗翰、柴德赓、教职联筹委会谭元＠、楼邦彦、赵承信、王玢、魏真、王序、卢念苏、张澜庆、赵琏、黄有莘，新文建筹委会陈定民、陈明绍、许京骐、裘克安、于效谦、蔡善昌、尹绍鸿、邓艾民、杨贵贞等二十五人。中共北平市委书记彭真同志也被邀参加。首先由谭元＠宣布开会，并提议教研联吴晗为主席。继由主席吴晗报告开会意义后，各团体相继发言，都感到今天各院校的教授、讲助、职员间的团体分散重复。为了增进彼此间的团结，一致同意由到会三团体联合发起筹备本市专科以上院校教职员联合会。并就其组织性质、成份，及筹备步骤展开讨论。钱端升、费青、陈定民、赵承信、许京骐、陈明绍、张澜庆、吴晗、谭元＠赵琏等相继发言。关于联合会的性质，大家都认为应是过渡到成立职工会的一个组织。彭真同志亦说明“脑力劳动者的教职员是工人阶级的一部分，它的联合组织，将来应该参加总工会。”关于会员入会的自愿原则问题，会上有热烈的争论，最后大家一致同意，这一组织的最后目标，应争取各院校全体教职员参加，但个别不愿参加的，不应免强。至于公认为不能参加的反动分子，应该拒绝其加入。关于组织形式与筹备步骤，经初步交换意见结果，一致同意各院校应有教职员联合会，并以之为基础组织平市总的院校教职员联合会。同时通过由各校教授会、讲助会、职员会，各派代表组成筹备委员会。负责其筹备工作。并决定昨日与会的三团体负责人为当然筹备委员，另推吴晗、许京骐、谭元＠三人为下次会议召集人。负责邀请未与会各单位推派代表参加筹备工作。并定于下星期日（十九）日上午九时在北大孑民堂举行第一次筹备委员会。各与会代表将返校广泛征求同人意见，带至会上讨论，以作更进一步的决定。　　（超祺）
