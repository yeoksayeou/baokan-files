　　Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 9th: Tokyo dispatch: From June 2nd to the morning of the 7th, more than 600 tram workers on Tokyo's three largest tram lines persisted in a five-day strike. The strike was to protest the killing of their comrade, tram worker Kinjiro Hashimoto, by police during a demonstration on May 29th, and to protest the arrest of more than sixty demonstrating workers. The strike involved nine tram lines, with more than 800 participants. Under the instigation of the American occupation authorities, the Tokyo Public Prosecutor's Office shamelessly forbade the strike on the evening of the 6th, using the excuse that "the strike violates the Potsdam Declaration." However, because the striking workers' just struggle won widespread sympathy from the citizens of Tokyo, the police authorities were forced to release half of the arrested workers on the 4th.

　　抗议六十余名工人被捕　东京电车工人罢工
    【新华社北平九日电】东京消息：六月二日至七日晨，东京市最大的三条电车线电车工人六百余人坚持了五天的罢工。罢工是为了抗议他们的战友，电车工人桥本金次郎在五月二十九日示威中之被警察杀害，抗议六十余名示威工人之被逮捕。罢工曾涉及九条电车线，参加罢工者达八百余人。东京检察署在美国占领当局的指使下于六日晚以“罢工是违反波茨坦宣言”的无耻借口，禁止了罢工。但由于罢工工人的正义斗争获得了东京市民的广泛同情，警察当局被迫于四日释放了半数被捕的工人。
