A Visit to the North China People's Revolutionary University
    Lin Hong
    I. Overview of the University
    The North China People's Revolutionary University was established in February this year, with its campus located in Xiyuan, west of the Summer Palace lake in the western suburbs of Beiping.
    The university has a total of over 12,000 students, with over 3,000 studying at the Tianjin branch and over 9,000 studying in Beiping. The majority of students are from student backgrounds, followed by factory and office workers, school teachers, and a small number of merchants, former soldiers, and unemployed workers. Female students account for slightly more than one-fifth of the total student body. A considerable number of students were originally out of school or unemployed, which is a legacy of the long-term rule of the Kuomintang reactionary regime.
    The university's organization includes a president, vice-president, and dean, each with one person. Under them are the Academic Affairs Office, Political Affairs Office, General Affairs Office, and a university office. The university office is the highest leading body of the entire university, and it has four departments and one branch. Each department has three sections: education, organization, and general affairs, as well as a secretariat, all under the leadership of the department director. Each department has ten classes (only the first department has nine classes), with approximately 250 students in each class, divided into ten large groups of 24 or 25 people. Each large group is further divided into three mutual-aid study groups as units for self-study and mutual-aid learning. The class is the basic organization for directly leading students' study and life, with a head teacher, deputy head teacher, and six or seven staff members. The head teacher is responsible for the overall situation of the class, guiding students' learning, and the staff members assist in organizing students' study life and all extracurricular cultural and recreational activities. Each group has a group leader and deputy group leader, elected by the students, to assist the class cadres in leading everyone's study and life.
    The university has a total of over 1,000 cadres and staff members, with veteran cadres accounting for more than two-thirds. The majority of them participated in the revolution during the First Great Revolution, the Ten-Year Civil War, and the early stages of the War of Resistance Against Japan, and have undergone long-term struggles.
    The study period is approximately six months. The curriculum is divided into four major parts: basic theories of Marxism-Leninism, basic issues of the Chinese revolution, current policies, and the construction and history of the Communist Party. In addition, it is coordinated with the study of the political situation. Chief Commander Zhu has given reports and lectures on the political situation and study issues (at the Tianjin branch), Comrade Bo Yibo on the political situation, Comrade Huang Jing on the issue of outlook on life, Comrade An Ziwen on the introduction of the Chinese Communist Party, Comrade Yang Xianzhen on historical materialism, Comrades Ai Siqi, Feng Wenbin and Lu Ping on the report on the establishment of the Communist Youth League, as well as class-linked lectures by many comrades from the Marxist-Leninist Academy, Comrade Song Ping's introduction to the Soviet Communist Youth League, Comrade Liu Ningyi's report on the situation of various countries in the world, and the impact of the victory of the Chinese revolution on the world, and Mr. Guo Moruo's lecture introducing the Soviet Union, etc.
    II. Transforming Barracks into Schools, Building the Campus Together
    The school buildings are spacious and tall, with beautiful scenery, providing an excellent learning environment. However, in the past, this place was occupied by the Kuomintang Youth Army 208th Division, a concentration camp for harming young people. Just over three months ago, due to the destruction by the Kuomintang bandit army, what was left to us was only desolation and filth. At that time, the students had not yet enrolled, and the cadres who had already arrived at the school and the eighty or ninety students who had entered the Revolutionary University in Liangxiang, under the call of the school, started working together, carrying bricks, clearing garbage, and cleaning toilets. Everyone worked from morning till night. The construction of a People's Revolutionary University began in this way. What is particularly worth mentioning here is the great contribution of the worker comrades introduced later by the Beiping Construction Workers' Union to the construction of the school. Because the workers realized that this was the people's own school, coupled with the school's respect for them and continuous education, and the students' kind and friendly attitude towards them, greatly inspired the workers' enthusiasm. On "May Day," the school invited them to celebrate the festival, and the students wrote them more than 200 letters of慰劳慰劳 (comfort and appreciation). The school's cultural troupe organized an evening party specifically for the workers, making the workers feel that it was truly their own university. In a letter thanking the students, the workers promised: "We will work even harder to build our own school and meet everyone's learning needs, so that we can graduate as soon as possible and serve the people." Workers, students, and staff were integrated into one, and everyone was particularly happy to work here. Therefore, on the Dragon Boat Festival, the Beiping Construction Workers' Union presented the Revolutionary University with a large plaque of "Revolutionary Furnace," which was hung in front of the school gate as a memorial.
    III. Major Gains After Entering the University
    Students have different motivations for entering the university: the vast majority come under the encouragement of the revolutionary upsurge, eagerly seeking progress. Some entered due to being out of school or unemployed, or due to economic problems, or because their families were in the Kuomintang-controlled areas and their sources of income were cut off. There were also a small number of people who came to the Revolutionary University for the sake of promotion, making a fortune, pursuing lovers, or "gilding" themselves. After more than two months of theoretical study, the students have rapidly undergone fundamental changes! Significant progress has been made, which can be summarized as follows:
    1. The establishment of a worldview of serving the people.
    The initial establishment of a new revolutionary worldview is one of the greatest gains for students after entering the university. When they first entered the university, some students felt unaccustomed to the life and were uneasy, while others slept during study time, were undisciplined and unfocused, and some female students continued to dress up and put on makeup and lipstick as before. In the early days of the school, snack vendors even ran into the campus. Furthermore, a very small number of elements who had previously served as military police did not study hard, displayed hooliganistic habits, and deliberately disrupted the study atmosphere. The ideological root of these bad habits was that the general students held outdated, backward, and even reactionary views on life. For example, some people said: "Life is like a dream, enjoy one day at a time." "People die for wealth, birds die for food." "No one gets up early unless they seek profit." "Society is changing rapidly, one should keep up with the times." "If life cannot leave a lasting fragrance, it should at least leave a stench for ten thousand years." Some people simply did not know what an outlook on life was. However, after a period of study, listening to reports on the political situation, revolutionary outlook on life, honesty and integrity, the history of social development, and historical materialism, the students were greatly enlightened. They learned that the world is created by the working people, and that class struggle is the driving force of class society. Everyone realized that the old ways of thinking were all wrong, and that the knowledge youth of the new era should serve the majority of the working people. Due to this change in thinking, the students' study enthusiasm was greatly promoted, their lives became simpler, and the previously existing phenomena of being undisciplined, unfocused, unorganized, and unregimented were quickly overcome. Students generally reviewed their shortcomings in group review meetings. They became active in their studies and, after returning home on Sundays, they even found the clothing and consciousness of their siblings to be unsophisticated and backward. Everyone also reviewed their past erroneous views on life, criticized their impure motives for entering the university, and many people re-established the view of studying for the people. They confessed to concealing their history, having served as military police in the past, and having done some anti-people things. Today, under the education of the Communist Party, they have also begun to recognize their past mistakes and are willing to work hard to transform themselves. A certain student once said: "I originally planned to conceal my false history, muddle through a few months at the university, and then go out to work. Who knew that once I changed to the viewpoint of serving the people, I couldn't hide it anymore. Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought are truly powerful!" In addition, there were also individual bad elements who had committed many evils in society in the past. After arriving at the university, they stole students' belongings and disrupted everyone's studies. Despite the school's leniency in handling them through general education meetings, small education meetings, and individual talks, they still did not repent. The students were extremely resentful, and in order to protect the studies of the vast majority of students and establish a good school atmosphere, the school had no choice but to expel them, such as Li Xuewu and four others. This measure was supported by the vast majority of students, proving it to be very correct. Today, in general, students are actively implementing timely routines in their study life and extracurricular activities, consciously abiding by the school's rules and regulations, obeying the covenants stipulated by the groups themselves, paying attention to tidying up their belongings and cleaning, and overcoming their past extravagant and undisciplined habits.
    2. Establishing the labor view that labor creates the world.
    The new view that labor creates the world has also been widely and rapidly established among students. This is another major gain in this period of studying the history of social development. In the early days of enrollment, most students despised labor and the working people. Some students said: "People other than intellectuals are not quick-witted and their thinking is slow. There is a danger of being eliminated." "Intellectuals should guide farmers and lead workers." However, the situation today has changed drastically. After studying the history of social development, the majority of students have recognized the truth that labor creates the world, have initially established a revolutionary labor viewpoint, and have expressed it in their specific activities. More than 7,000 students participated in labor in Xiyuan, forming a joyful labor army in groups at 6:00 p.m. every day, carrying out labor on the open fields near the school, digging, watering, and planting, truly responding to the call of the North China Bureau for production and thrift. More than 100 mu of wasteland near the school has been transformed into green vegetable gardens, and the reclamation of new wasteland is still expanding. On "May Day," students from various catering units automatically helped cook for a day, and female students took the initiative to wash clothes and sew quilts for the cooks, who gratefully said: "How could we have had a good festival in the past? Today, we have truly turned over!" The atmosphere of participating in labor is becoming increasingly in-depth, and even the students at the large stone bridge school have begun to repair it themselves. The movement to save an ounce of rice to help disaster relief has been widely carried out throughout the school. They not only labor on campus, but also many classes have organized "labor groups," "farming assistance groups," and "rush planting groups"... etc., using holidays and leisure time to go to the countryside to help farmers cultivate. In Bagou Village, Chuanying Village, and Shucun, their footprints can be seen. An old man named Liu Zhendong in Shucun happily said: "Truly everything has changed under the leadership of Chairman Mao. Students also farm for us. With more people, there is greater strength. The work done in a while would take my old man three days to complete." He said, smiling with his mouth wide open. This situation, from despising labor to taking pride in participating in labor, clearly points out a path that intellectuals should take. Chairman Mao instructed us: "Intellectuals must integrate with workers and peasants." The students of the Revolutionary University are turning this famous saying into their own practice.
    3. Starting to establish a class viewpoint of looking at all issues from a class analysis perspective, the study of class struggle, the study of the Marxist-Leninist view of the state, the study of the transition from new democracy to socialism and communism..., has enabled the students to make a stage-by-stage leap forward. Many people are clearing up their supra-class viewpoints. In the past, some people thought, "I am neither revolutionary nor counter-revolutionary, neither standing on the side of the Kuomintang nor standing on the side of the Communist Party." Today, they realize that this is a fantasy and is wrong. Understanding bourgeois democracy and proletarian democracy, bourgeois dictatorship and proletarian dictatorship, new democracy and old democracy, etc., has cleared up their bourgeois democratic thinking. In the past, they thought that the United States was democratic, but today they know that it is only the dictatorship of the big capitalists, while the Soviet Union is truly democratic. The study of this issue has made the students abandon or are in the process of abandoning all the positions, viewpoints, and methods of the bourgeoisie and petty bourgeoisie in looking at issues. The students' awareness has been raised, and their studies have become more active. Classes compete with each other, groups compete with each other, and individuals compete with each other. Full-class discussions and heated debates are held. They argue even during sleeping and eating, and their desire for knowledge is very high. They feel that the teachers' lectures are too short.
    When students from working-class backgrounds first entered the university, their enthusiasm for learning was low because they were afraid of being discriminated against by intellectuals. However, after studying "labor creates the world" and class struggle, their class consciousness was enlightened. Xi Baorui said: "I am a worker. After coming to the Revolutionary University, seeing that the students were all from student and staff backgrounds and that their education level was higher than mine, I always felt that they looked down on me, and my mood was very low. After studying labor creates the world and class struggle, it immediately spoke to my heart and said everything I wanted to say. I can definitely announce: 'Without the leadership of our working class in the revolution, the people will never be able to stand up!'"
    The tendency of students from intellectual backgrounds to despise students from working-class backgrounds is also beginning to change. Wang Yushan, a student from the industrial working class in the Sixteenth Class of the Second Department, was warmly called "Sister Wang" in the group. Due to her hard work, concern for her classmates, and other good qualities, many students recognized the noble qualities of the working class. Those who originally looked down on her are now secretly discussing: "It's easy for her to learn our culture, but it's difficult for us to learn her ideology and style!"
    4. Starting to use the weapon of criticism and self-criticism.
    Criticism and self-criticism have played a great role in promoting students' learning, life, and ideological transformation. When they first entered the university, most students did not know what criticism and self-criticism were. At the first and second life review meetings, everyone was embarrassed to lose face, thinking that pointing out their own shortcomings was a disgrace. Regarding the mistakes of others, they also felt that the other party was already so old, or was a good friend or relative in peacetime, and it was a bit embarrassing to speak out. Some students liked others to say good things about them and praise them. When others pointed out their shortcomings, they became unhappy and even misunderstood the other party, not knowing that criticism is the most powerful weapon to help them progress. After this period of exploration, the weapon of criticism has been widely used among students in various departments and has become a regular phenomenon. Some have been carried out very well, solving many problems. It has played a great role in correcting students' undisciplined behavior, correcting their learning attitudes, and criticizing various erroneous ideas. Yin Shusen, a student from the Eighteenth Class of the Second Department, said: "The more criticism I receive, the faster I can progress and the more I can be tempered into a truly qualified revolutionary fighter." Most students have said that criticism is of great help in transforming their thinking and have taken the initiative to request an increase in the time for weekly life review meetings. However, there are still some shortcomings in the use of criticism: such as sometimes failing to grasp the center, finding minor faults, and a few quarrels. But it is believed that these shortcomings will be gradually overcome in future study and life.

    华北人民革命大学访问记
    林洪
    一、学校概况
    华北人民革命大学创立于今年二月，校址设于北平西郊万寿山湖畔之西苑。
    该校共有学员一万两千余人，住在天津分校的三千余人，在平学习的有九千多人。学员来历以学生出身的占大多数，工厂机关职员学校教师次之，此外还有一小部份商贩旧军人和失业工人等。女同学约占学员总数的五分之一强。学员中原来失学、失业的占相当大的数目，这是国民党反动政权长期统治下留给人民的恶果。
    学校组织设校长副校长教育长各一人，下设教务处政治处校务处和一个校部办公室，校部是全校最高领导机关，下设四个部，一个分校，每部设教育、组织、总务三科及秘书室，受部主任领导，每部有十个班（只第一部是九个班），每班有学员二百五十人左右，以二十四、五人为一大组，每组分为三个互助学习小组，以作自修互助学习的单位，全班共十个大组。班是直接领导学员学习生活的基础组织，设正副班主任及干事六、七人。班主任掌握全班情况，指导学员学习，干事协助组织学员学习生活及一切课外文化娱乐活动，小组设正副组长，由同学中选举，协助班干部领导大家的学习与生活。
    全校共有干部工作人员一千余人，老干部约占三分之二强，大多数是第一次大革命十年内战时代和抗战初期就参加革命、受过长期斗争锻炼的。
    学习期限约六个月。课程共分马列主义基本理论，中国革命基本问题，当前各种政策，共产党的建设及其历史等四大部份，此外，还配合着政治形势的学习，先后到学校作过报告上过课的有朱总司令的政治形势和学习问题（在天津分校讲），薄一波同志的政治形势，黄敬同志的人生观问题，安子文同志的介绍中国共产党，杨献珍同志的唯物史观，艾思奇同志的社会发展史，冯文彬陆平同志的建团报告，还有马列学院许多同志的班联课，宋平同志的介绍苏联青年团，刘宁一同志的世界各国情况，和中国革命胜利对于世界的影响及郭沫若先生演讲介绍苏联等。
    二、变兵营为学校，大家动手建设校园
    校舍宽敞高大，风景秀丽，是一个很好的学习环境，但在过去盘据此地的是国民党青年军二○八师，是残害青年的集中营，在三个多月以前，由于国民党匪军的破坏，遗给我们的只是荒凉与污秽。当时学员尚未入学，由已到学校的干部和在良乡就进了革大的八、九十个学生，在学校的号召下，一齐动手，抬砖头、出垃圾、清除厕所，大家从早忙到晚。一座人民革命大学的修建就是这样开始的，在这儿特别值得提出的，就是后来由北平建筑工人联合会介绍来的工人同志们对于建设学校的贡献很大，由于工人们认识到这是人民自己的学校，加上校方对于他们的尊重和不断上课教育，学员对他们态度的和霭亲切，大大启发了工人的积极性，“五一”劳动节，学校请他们过节，同学们写给他们二百多封慰劳信，学校文工团专为工人组织晚会，使工人们感觉真正是自己的大学，工人们在答谢学员的信中保证说：“我们将要更加倍努力，建设我们自己的学校，满足大家学习的要求，以便早日毕业好去给人民办事。工人学生职员融合成一片，大家在这里做工特别高兴，于是端五节那天，北平建筑工人联合会，就送给革大一个“革命熔炉”的大匾，挂在校部门前以示纪念。
    三、入校后的几大收获
    学员入校动机各有不同：绝大多数是在革命高潮的鼓舞下，迫切要求进步而来的。一部份是由于失学失业，或迫于生活问题，或家在国统区经济来源断绝而入学，也有少数人是为了升官发财，追逐爱人，或“镀金”而上革大的，经过两个多月来的理论学习，同学们已迅速地起了根本的变化！获得了显著进步，总起来说，表现在下列方面：
    １、为人民服务的人生观的建立。
    新的革命的人生观的初步建立，是学员入校后的一个最大收获。刚入学时，有些同学感到生活不习惯，情绪不安，有些则在学习时间睡觉，自由散漫，不遵守纪律，有些女生照旧梳洗打扮抹粉涂口红。开学初期卖零食的摊贩甚至跑到校园中来。更有极少数曾作过宪兵军警的分子，不努力学习，带有流氓习气，故意破坏学风。这些不良作风的思想根源，是由于一般学员对人生抱着陈旧的落后的甚至反动的看法。如有人说：“人生如梦，快乐一天算一天。”“人为财死，鸟为食亡”。“人不图利谁肯早起”。“社会变化很快，应随时代跑。”“人生不能流芳百世，也当遗臭万年”。尚有少数人根本不知道什么叫人生观。但经过一阶段的学习，听了关于政治形势、革命人生观、忠诚老实、社会发展史唯物史观等报告，给了学员很大启示；知道世界是劳动人民创造的，阶级斗争是阶级社会的推动力，大家才知道过去的一套看法都是错误的，新时代的知识青年应为大多数劳动人民服务。由于这一思想的变化，大大的推动了学员的学习情绪，生活方面变朴素了，原来存在的自由散漫无组织无纪律的现象也很快的克服了。同学们普遍地在小组检讨会上检讨着自己的缺点，学习积极起来，礼拜日到家之后连家中弟兄姐妹们穿衣装束不朴素意识落后的情况倒看不惯了。大家也检讨了过去对人生错误的看法，批判了自己不纯的入校动机，许多人重新建立为人民而学习的学习观点，说出了自己隐瞒历史，过去做过宪兵特务，干过一些反人民的事，今天在共产党的教育下，也开始认识了过去的错误，愿意努力改造自己，有某同学曾经说：我本来打算把我的假历史隐瞒下去，在学校混几个月就出去做事，谁知一变成了为人民服务的观点，自己就隐瞒不下去了，马列主义和毛主席思想真利害！此外还有个别的不良分子，过去在社会上就作恶多端，到校后，偷窃同学衣物扰乱大家学习，虽经学校大会教育、小会教育、个别谈话等宽大处理，而仍不知悔改，同学们已愤恨之极，学校为保护绝大多数同学的学习，建立优良校风，不得不将其开除校籍如李学武等四人，此种措施得到了广大学员的拥护，证明非常正确。到今天，一般学员在学习生活及课外活动方面，都很积极执行按时作息，自觉地遵守学校校规，服从小组自己规定的公约，注意整理内务清洁卫生，克服了过去奢侈散漫的作风。
    ⒉树立了劳动创造世界的劳动观点
    对劳动创造世界的新观点也在同学中普遍地迅速地建立起来，这是这一时期学习社会发展史中的又一大收获，在入学的初期，多数同学卑视劳动与劳动人民。有的同学说：“知识分子以外的人，头脑不灵活，思想很迟缓，有被淘汰的危险”，“知识分子，应指导农民，领导工人”，然而今天的情形已经大变了，经过社会发展史的学习，大多数同学认识了劳动创造世界的真理，初步树立了革命的劳动观点，并表现在他们具体的活动上。在西苑参加劳动的学生有七千余人，每天下午六点钟时成群结伙地形成一支劳动大军，在学校附近的旷野上进行愉快的劳动，有掘地的，浇水的，点种的，真正响应了华北局生产节约的号召。学校邻近一百多亩荒地已变成了绿油油的菜园，直到现在还在扩大开垦新荒。“五一”劳动节各伙食单位的学员自动帮厨一日，女同学抢先给炊事员同志洗衣服缝被子，五灶炊事员同志们感激地说：“过去我们怎能过个好节日，今天真翻了身！”参加劳动的风气日渐深入，连学校的大石桥学生已开始自己修好了。节约一两米的救灾运动，在全校普遍开展，他们不仅在校内劳动，而且有很多班组织了“劳动团”、“助耕团”、“抢种团”………等，利用假日和暇时下乡帮助农民耕作，在巴沟村、船营村、树村，都有他们的足迹，树村一位刘振东老大爷高兴地说：“真是毛主席领导的啥都变了，学生也给咱种地，人多力量大，一会做的活，让我老汉三天也作不完”。说着笑的张着大嘴。这种从卑视劳动到以参加劳动为荣的情况，明确地指出了一条知识分子应走的道路，毛主席指示我们：“知识分子要和工农相结合”，这句名言，革命大学的学员们正把他变成自己的实践。
    ３、开始建立一切问题从阶级分析上着眼的阶级观点，阶级斗争的学习、马列主义国家观的学习、从新民主主义转变到社会主义共产主义的学习……，使同学们起来一个划阶段飞跃的进步，许多人清算着自己的超阶级观点，过去曾有人想着我既不革命又不反革命，既不站在国民党方面，又不站在共产党方面，今天才知道这是空想，是错误的。懂得了资产阶级民主和无产阶级民主、资产阶级专政和无产阶级专政、新民主主义旧民主主义等，就清算了自己的资产阶级民主思想，过去以为美国是民主的，今天知道不过是大资本家的专政，而苏联才是真正的民主。这个问题的学习使同学们一下子抛弃了或正在抛弃着一切资产阶级及小资产阶级看问题的立场观点和方法。同学们觉悟提高了，学习更为积极，各班和各班、各组和各组、各个人和各个人，展开学习竞赛，全班大讨论，热烈的论战，睡觉吃饭也在争论着，求知心很高，上课嫌教员讲的时间短。
    工人出身的学员初入学时，因怕受知识分子歧视，学习情绪低落。但学习“劳动创造世界”和阶级斗争后，便启发了他们的阶级觉悟。习宝锐说：“我是一个工人，到革命大学后，看到同学们都是学生、职员出身，文化程度都比我高，总觉得他们看不起我，我情绪很低。学习劳动创造世界和阶级斗争后，这一下可说到我心眼里了，把我一肚子愿意说的话，都替我说出来了。我敢肯定地宣布：‘没有咱们工人阶级领导革命，人民就永不能翻身！’”
    知识分子出身的学员轻视工人出身的偏向也在开始转变，二部十六班产业工人出身的王玉珊同学在组里被热烈的呼为“王大姐”，由于她努力学习，关心同学等优良作风，使很多同学认识了工人阶级的高贵品质，原来轻视他的人现在都暗地议论：“她学习咱的文化易，咱学她的思想作风难！”
    ４、开始在运用批评和自我批评的武器。
    批评和自我批评在推动同学的学习、生活及思想的改造上，起了很大的作用。初入学时，大多数同学不知道什么叫做批评和自我批评，在第一、二次的生活检讨会上，大家都放不下面子，认为说出自己的缺点是一种耻辱；对于别人的错误，也觉得对方已经那样大的年龄，或者平日和自己是要好的朋友亲戚，说出来有些难为情；有些同学则喜欢别人说他的好处，夸奖他，当别人说出他的短处时，便不高兴，甚至对对方发生误会，而不知道批评是帮助自己进步最有力的武器。经过这一段时期的摸索后，批评的武器已在各部学员中间普遍运用，已成经常现象。有些进行得很好，解决了不少问题。在纠正学员的自由散漫、端正学习态度、批判各种错误思想等方面，起了极大作用，二部十八班的尹树森同学说：“多得些批评，进步才能快，才能锻炼成名符其实的革命战士。”大多数同学都表示批评对于改造自己的思想，有着很大帮助，主动要求增加每周生活检讨会的时间。但在运用批评时，仍然存在着一些缺点：如象有时抓不住中心，找小毛病，少数吵嘴等，但相信这一些缺点，在今后的学习生活中，会逐渐加以克服。
            （未完）
