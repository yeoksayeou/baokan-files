The entire railway engineering workforce must mobilize to oppose slackers and strengthen track maintenance!
    Lü Zhengcao

Based on a recent inspection of several engineering sections near Beiping, it was discovered that we are very careless about track maintenance and, in reality, there is a serious phenomenon of no one being responsible (see the first page of this newspaper on the 8th and 10th). Steel rails are worn, track gauge does not meet regulations, joints are too wide, joint heads are uneven, trains shake when passing, causing too much damage to tracks and locomotives. The roadbed along the line has not been sorted out or tamped. Between Nankou and Xizhimen, weeds grow like wasteland, screws are loose, and spikes are floating, which has become a common phenomenon. There are even missing screws and spikes, and broken fishplates. In the station, some rail bottoms are embedded in sleepers, and sleepers are buried in the soil and have not been taken care of for a long time, allowing them to corrode. No one is seriously responsible for the turnouts, and the turnout gauge often does not meet the specifications, and the anti-creepers do not work. The situations cannot be described in detail. The reason for this situation is, of course, the result of the Kuomintang's bureaucratic style, so there are many excuses, but it can be pointed out that these excuses are groundless.

One excuse: that's how it was during the Kuomintang period! Of course, many of the defects here were left over from the reactionary rule and caused by the reactionary faction launching the anti-people civil war. However, once the railway is owned by the people, we should be determined to improve the old defects and come up with specific methods to improve the old defects and strengthen and maintain the newly repaired routes. We cannot use congenital deficiencies as an excuse. Therefore, the situation in several engineering sections near Beiping today deserves serious attention from all railway administrations and engineering sections. If this situation continues to exist, not only will the entire railway's struggle goal of shortening vehicle turnaround rates and the country's transportation tasks be impossible to complete satisfactorily, but also there will be no guarantee for the safety of train operations.

The second excuse is that there is too much work and we are too busy. Of course, for units with heavier repair tasks, a meticulous plan should be made to allocate forces and put track maintenance in an appropriate position, so that track maintenance can be taken care of. However, many track maintenance workers in the Ping suburbs have not all been drawn away to participate in repairs, and they also use being busy as an excuse. This is a completely unfounded argument. For example, the Beijing East Station line is 9.5 kilometers long, with a quota of 46 people, and half of them are occupied by the section, leaving only more than 20 people. Even this remaining number of people is enough for track maintenance. In fact, it is the result of leading cadres being lazy for a long time, turning a blind eye to the line conditions, and becoming accustomed to it.

The third excuse is the lack of materials. This point cannot be used as a "shield" for neglecting track maintenance. In fact, most of the defects mentioned above are not due to materials, but the result of turning a blind eye and sloppy work. Even the way to solve the difficulty of materials lies in our ability to make good use of existing human, intellectual, and material resources, and we can make up for the lack of material resources through diligent work. There are many conceivable methods, such as steel rails can be exchanged left and right, and sleepers can be chipped to further exert their effectiveness. Especially important is to mobilize the enthusiasm and creativity of the workers, which is a source of latent and infinite wisdom. It can make up for the difficulty of material shortage to a certain extent.

There is also an excuse: although the line is bad, there have been no accidents. This is a conservative view that violates science. The erroneous idea of "just getting by" and "coping with it without accidents" in order to avoid personal responsibility is an unscientific and irresponsible attitude towards the people's cause. All these excuses have no basis and are just "shields" for slackers. They must be exposed, opposed, and corrected. We must establish a serious attitude of serving the people and being responsible to the people in our thinking and work.

In order to improve the above situation, correct work attitudes, and effectively strengthen track maintenance, the following tasks must be immediately mobilized for all employees to take action and speed up work: (1) Conduct in-depth inspections and cultivate models. Those in charge of engineering should go to the site to study all the details and small matters of labor organization. In reality, eliminate the phenomenon of no one being responsible, correctly allocate labor, establish a responsibility system and work standards, which is much better than working in the office all day. This is a new working method that can discover countless new things. In in-depth inspections, we must discover models, cultivate models, and establish the banner of model engineering sections and model track teams. Spread it throughout the railway. This will greatly promote our work; (2) Mobilize workers and improve leadership: Establish the workers' attitude of being masters of labor, give full play to their enthusiasm, and promote worker cadres to become the main link to ensure the completion of work tasks. Generally, the engineering section chiefs and other technical personnel in the newly liberated areas, under the great victory situation, have an unprecedented spirit of willingness to serve the people, and at the same time, it is the best opportunity to fully exert everyone's wisdom and skills for the first time. Here, technical personnel are required to work hard to transform their thinking, attach importance to labor, and integrate with the workers, diligently looking, doing, thinking, and talking on the line, not only guiding workers to work, but also learning from the workers and improving workers while improving themselves; (3) Formulate plans and summarize experiences: Implementing plans is the embodiment of the actual activities of millions of people. We must carry out work according to the plan and often review the extent to which the plan is implemented; make out the work plan for the second half of the year as early as possible, and summarize track maintenance experience at any time, accumulate experience, and exchange experience. After the rainy season, the Ministry of Railways will hold a national engineering conference to discuss plans, summarize experiences, and report on models, which must become the main content of the conference. I hope that all railway administrations will actively speed up track maintenance, maintain the lines well, and ensure the victorious completion of transportation tasks.

### 全路工务职工动员起来反对懒汉，加强养路工作！

　　全路工务职工动员起来反对懒汉，加强养路工作！
    吕正操
    根据最近检查北平附近几个工务段的情形，发现我们对于养路工作非常马虎与实际上无人负责的严重现象（见本报八、十两日一版）。钢轨磨耗，轨距不合规定，接缝太宽，接头不平，列车经过时发生颠动，对于轨道与机车损失太大。沿线道床未加整理，亦未捣固。南口至西直门间，野草丛生，有如荒地，螺丝松动，道钉浮起，成为普遍现象。甚至螺丝道钉缺少，鱼尾板破裂。站内有的轨底陷入枕木，枕木埋于土中，长久无人过问，任其腐蚀。道岔无人认真负责，岔子轨距多不合规格，防爬器不起作用等情况，非笔墨所能详述。造成这种情形的原因，当然是国民党官僚作风的结果，因此就有许多说法作为借口，但可以指出这些说法是毫无根据的。
    一种说法：国民党时期就是如此！当然这里很多的缺陷，是反动统治时期所遗留的，与反动派发动反人民内战所造成的。但铁路一经为人民所有，就应对此种缺陷下定最大决心与想出具体办法改善旧有的缺陷，对新抢修的路线，加紧补强与养护，自不能以先天不足为借口。所以今天北平附近几个工务段的情形，值得引起各管理局与各工务段的严重注意。此种情形如任其继续存在，非但全路缩短车辆周转率的奋斗目标与国家的运输任务无法圆满实现，即对行车之安全也毫无保证。
    第二种说法是活太多，忙不开，当然，对于检修任务较重的单位，应缜密计划，分配力量，把养路工作放在适当的地位上，自然可以兼顾养路工作，而平郊很多养路工，并没有全部抽走参加抢修，也把活忙当作借口，这是丝毫没有根据的说法。例如北平东站线路延长九公里半，定员四十六人，段内占用多，名字即达半数，尚有二十余人，即此余下人数也足够养路之用。实际上是领导干部长期在那里干懒汉子活，对于线路状况熟视无睹，习以为常所造成的结果。
    第三种说法是材料缺乏，此点也不能成为忽视养路工作的“挡箭牌”。实际上以上所指出的缺陷，绝大部分不是材料的关系，而是熟视无睹，工作马虎的结果，即解决材料困难的办法，也在于我们善于高度发挥现有的人力、智力、物力，可以勤劳的工作去补救物力的不足。可想的办法很多，例如钢轨可以左右调换，枕木可以锛削，进一步发挥他的效用。尤其重要的是发动工人群众的积极性与创造性，这是潜伏的无限智慧的源泉。可以在某种限度内补足材料缺乏的困难。
    还有一种说法：线路虽坏没出过事故，这是违反科学的保守观点。“勉强过去就行”，“对付着不出事故”，设法避免个人担负责任的错误观念，这是对于人民事业非科学的、不负责任的态度。所有这些说法，没有任何根据，只是懒汉的“挡箭牌”，必须加以揭破，必须反对，必须纠正这种认识，建立认真为人民服务，对人民负责的思想和工作态度。
    为了改善上述情况，改正工作态度，有效的加强养路工作，以下几项工作必须立即动员全体职工行动起来，加紧赶工：（一）深入检查与培养典型，工务方面负责人应该到现地去研究劳动组织方面的一切细节与小事。在实际上把无人负责的现象消灭，正确的配备劳动力，建立负责制与工作标准，比整天的在办公室办公事好得多，这是新的工作方法，能发现无数的新鲜事物。在深入检查中要发现典型，培养典型，树立起模范工务段，模范道班的旗帜。在全路传播出去。这将对我们的工作起很大的推动作用；（二）发动工人与改善领导：树立工人群众的主人翁的劳动态度，发挥积极性，提拔工人干部，成为保证工作任务完成的主要环节。一般新解放区的工务段长与其他技术人员，在伟大胜利形势之下，都有了从所未有的、愿意为人民服务的精神，同时也是第一次得到充分发挥大家智慧与技能的最好机会。这里要求技术人员努力改造思想，重视劳动和工人打成一片，在线路上不辞辛苦的勤看、勤做、勤想、勤说，不仅指导工人工作，而且必须向工人群众学习，提高工人同时又提高自己；（三）制订计划与总结经验：实现计划是千百万人实际活动的体现，我们要按照计划进行工作，经常检讨计划执行的程度；及早的制出下半年工作计划，随时总结养路工作经验，积累经验，交流经验。雨季后，铁道部将召开全国工务会议，讨论计划，总结经验，报告典型，必须成为会议的主要内容。希望各铁路管理局积极加紧养路工作，把线路养好，保证运输任务的胜利完成。
