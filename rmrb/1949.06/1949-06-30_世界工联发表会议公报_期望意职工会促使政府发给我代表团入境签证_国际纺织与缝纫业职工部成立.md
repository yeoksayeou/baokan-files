    【新华社北平二十九日电】塔斯社米兰讯：世界工联执行局于二十五至二十六日在米兰举行会议，并发表公报称：执行局已审议并支持南朝鲜总工会及蒙古人民共和国职工会中央理事会要求加入世界工联的申请。世界工联执委会在其下次会议上，将以执行局的建议为基础，在接受这两个会员的问题上作出决定。执行局听取了关于五金业工人在都灵、纺织与缝纫业工人在里昂、制鞋与皮革业工人在哥特瓦尔德城举行国际职工部成立大会的报告。执行局对建立世界工联这三个新的职工部表示完全满意。执行局对其委员世界工联副主席刘宁一（中国）之不能到会表示遗憾，他现在布拉格等候意大利政府发给入境签证。执行局期望意大利职工会组织出来干涉，借使签证得以发出，并经由它们要求意政府不要限制应在世界工联执行局及执委会中执行职责的委员们底代表权。
