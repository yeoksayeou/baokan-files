　　North China Agricultural Machinery Plant Strives to Reduce Production Costs
    [This newspaper reports] The North China Agricultural Machinery Plant is responding to Mayor Ye's and the Party newspaper's call to reduce the cost of agricultural machinery in order to serve the peasants. It is now beginning or preparing to carry out the following tasks: First, engineers are re-calculating product costs precisely. The estimated cost of a trial-produced electric water pump is about 8,000 jin of millet per unit (including 2,580 jin for model materials and expenses); now, with plans for mass production, in addition to saving on model materials and expenses, efforts will be made to reduce the price of each water pump to below 4,000 jin of millet through improved technology, increased efficiency, and savings in materials, time, and electricity. Second, in order to incorporate more of the peasants' opinions into the manufacturing process and improve the machines, future machines will be tested on nearby farmland after they are made, and peasants will be invited to visit and provide guidance. The plant is prepared to use combine harvesters during this year's wheat harvest to help the peasants harvest wheat. In order to strengthen ties with the peasants, the plant also plans to investigate its existing ninety-odd iron workshops (i.e., complete sets of tools for rural blacksmiths) and first use several of these workshops to establish one or two service stations for experimentation. Each station will be staffed with a cadre who will work with rural blacksmiths. In addition to repairing and manufacturing simple farm tools, they will also assist in the installation, repair, fitting, training, and promotion of the agricultural machinery produced by the plant, and collect the peasants' opinions on agricultural machinery in order to improve it. Once the service station experiments are successful and experience is gained, more service stations will be established according to the needs of the peasants. In addition, regarding the promotion of the plant's agricultural medicines, plans are in place to deliver them to the peasants through state-owned farms, cooperatives, stores, and direct sales.

　　华北农业机械总厂努力减低出品成本
    【本报讯】华北农业机械总厂响应叶市长与党报号召，减低农业机器成本，为农民服务。现正开始或准备进行以下几件工作：首先，工程师对产品再作精确计算。试造的一部电力水泵，每部估价在八千斤小米左右（模型工料费用需二千五百八十斤在内）；现在计划大批制造，除省去模型工料外，将再从提高技术，增加效率，节省工料、时间、电力等方面，争取使每部水泵能低于四千斤小米的价格出售。其次，为了在制造上多吸收农民的意见，改进机器，今后每做一件机器后，即在附近农田上试验，请农民参观指导。该厂已准备在今年的麦收期间用收割机，帮助农民割麦。为密切与农民的联系，该厂并准备将现存的九十几部铁工铺（即农村铁匠用的全套工具）经过调查后，首先利用几部铁工铺，设立一两个服务站进行试验，每站派一个干部，与农村铁匠结合。除修理与制造简单的农具外，并配合按装、修配、教练与推广该厂所出的农业机械，搜集农民对农业机器的意见；以求得改进。该服务站试验成功，获得经验后，再根据农民需要，建立更多的服务站。另外，关于推广本厂农业药品问题，计划利用国营农场、合作社、商店代售与自己出售等方式送到农民手中。
