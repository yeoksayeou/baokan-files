  　Implements Mechanical Responsibility System
  　Extends Machine Life and Improves Production Efficiency
    [Our Newspaper] In order to extend the service life of machinery and improve production efficiency, the Changxindian Railway Machinery Plant has now begun a crash program to overhaul machines and implement a mechanical responsibility system. Based on the spirit of the Northern Factory Affairs Conference, the plant has implemented this work step by step while realizing democratic management. First, the Technology Section formulated forms, solicited opinions from machine users, and understood the machine's condition in preparation for necessary repairs and the implementation of the responsibility system. At the beginning, because the rationale was not clearly explained, many workers had concerns about the responsibility system, mistakenly believing that "as long as the machine breaks down, they will be punished." Therefore, out of 197 machines in the machinery workshop, only one reported that it was in good condition. Later, according to the mechanical maintenance and usage regulations drafted by the Factory Affairs Conference, explanations were given regarding issues such as responsible and non-responsible accidents, and the commendation and rewards that should be given to users who maintained and repaired machinery well, thereby exceeding "scheduled inspections" or saving labor and materials. Only then was a more accurate picture obtained. Among the 775 machines in the entire plant, 312 were in good condition and could be managed without repair, and 463 required repair before they could be managed. In order not to affect normal production and to meet the requirements of the increased production tasks for the second half of the year, it was decided to divide them into three batches for crash repairs, repairing and assigning responsibility at any time. The first batch will temporarily repair 153 special machines and those with minor damage. Specific practices: The Work Section will, according to the urgency of the current production tasks of each workshop, issue work orders to the repair workshop according to plan, and each repair team will then cooperate with the inspection section to disassemble and repair the machines. When necessary, the Technology Section will draw drawings. After completion, the inspectors will conduct post-repair inspections and test runs, and then hand them over to the users, and fill in the machine condition table and the responsible person's nameplate. In order to enable users to gradually achieve the requirement of undertaking partial repairs from guaranteeing management and use within one year, users must participate in on-site learning during the repair period. As of June 24, 21 machines including the universal milling machine, wheel turning lathe, axle head turning lathe of the machinery workshop, and the cutting machine and tube sweeping machine of the furnace workshop have been successively overhauled. For machinery that can be managed without repair, a method of starting from key points and gradually promoting it is adopted. The electrical workshop was relatively well-prepared in its mobilization and discussion, and the workers were willing to implement the responsibility system earlier, believing that: "Implementing it one day earlier means one day earlier to calculate working hours, and being commended for exceeding 'scheduled inspection'; implementing it one day later means the machine will wear more for one day, failing to reach 'scheduled inspection' and losing face." Therefore, after the workers automatically cleaned ten power machines such as air compressors, generators, and steam water pumps, and seventy transformers that did not need repair, according to the machine equipment conditions, some machines were the responsibility of one person, some three machines were the responsibility of two people or two machines were the responsibility of three people; the transformers were the responsibility of 20 people, with each person averaging four to six. Because the transformer group was too scattered, workers Hu Shuqi and Zhang Junfeng proposed the slogan of mutual assistance management and mutual assistance repair, which everyone agreed to. The furnace workshop has also received wooden signs and is implementing it. However, these are only the beginning. Many workshop supervisors and workers still do not have a sufficient understanding of the responsibility system, and take a delaying attitude on the grounds that "the machinery is not good" and "production is busy." Therefore, it is necessary to continue to carry out in-depth enlightenment and education, so that the responsibility system will achieve good results.

### 长辛店铁路机厂　实行机械负责制　延长机械寿命提高生产效率

　　长辛店铁路机厂
  　实行机械负责制
  　延长机械寿命提高生产效率
    【本报讯】长辛店铁路机厂为延长机械寿命，提高生产效率，现已开始突击检修机器，推行机械负责制。该厂根据北方厂务会议精神，在实现管理民主化的同时，有步骤地推行了这一工作。首先由技术科制定表册，征求机械使用人的意见，了解机械状况，以备进行必要的检修，实行负责制。开始，因为道理没讲清，许多工友对负责制存有顾虑，误认为“只要机械坏了，就得受处分”，因此，机械场一百九十七台机器，报状况良好的仅一台。后依照厂务会议所拟定的机械保管使用规程，对责任与非责任事故，及使用人对机械保修良好，因而超过“定检”或有省工省料情形者，应受到表扬奖励等问题作了解释，才获得了比较真实的情况。全厂七百七十五台机械中，状态良好，不经检修即可负责者三百一十二台，需经检修方可负责者四百六十三台。为了不影响正常生产，并符合下半年增产任务的要求，决定将其分三批突击检修，随时检修，随时负责。第一批暂修特种和伤损轻微的机器一百五十三台。具体作法：由工作科根据目前各场生产任务的缓急，有计划地开工作票给修配场，各修配班再协同检工科进行拆卸检修，必要时由技术科绘图。完工后，检工员作修后检查和试运转，然后交与使用人，并填写机械状况表和责任者牌号。为实现使用人在一年以内从包管包用逐渐达到担任局部检修的要求，在检修期间，使用人须实地参加学习。至六月二十四日，机械场万能洗床，车轮旋床，轴头旋床和建立场剪刀机，制炉场扫管机等二十一台机械，已先后开始检修，对不经检修即可负责的机械，采取从重点作起，逐步推广的办法。电机场动员酝酿比较成熟，工友对负责制愿提早实行，认为：“早实行一天，可早计算一天工时，超过‘定检’又受表扬；晚实行一天，机器就多磨耗一天，达不到‘定检’，反落丢人。”因此，不需检修的压风机、发电机、蒸汽水泵等十部动力机器和七十个变压器，经过工友自动清扫，根据机器设备情形，有的一部机器一人负责，有的三部机器两人负责或两部机器三人负责；变压器由二十人负责，每人平均四个至六个。因变压器群太分散，工友胡书起，张俊峰提出互助管理、互助检修的口号，大家表示同意。制炉场也领回了木牌，正在实行。不过这些还仅是开始，不少分场主管人和工友，对负责制的认识还很不够，借口“机械不好”，“生产忙”，而采取拖延态度。因此需要继续进行深入的启发教育，负责制才会做出好的成绩。
