Xinhua News Agency, Peiping, 24th -- Moscow dispatch: Six thousand Young Pioneer camps organized by the Soviet Trade Unions have opened, providing summer vacations for hundreds of thousands of children. Approximately three million children in the primary grades of urban elementary schools, including orphans and children of war invalids, will be sent to rural summer camps in the Russian Federation. Throughout the countryside, many summer nurseries and kindergartens will accommodate the children of collective farmers during the busy farming season. The governments and public organizations of Ukraine have allocated substantial funds for this purpose. The trade unions of Kharkov Oblast alone have allocated 25 million rubles from their social insurance funds to finance summer camps for 44,000 children during the vacation period. The working people of Armenia are particularly concerned about school children and have decided to organize excursions to the most beautiful scenic areas of the republic, with 15,000 upper-grade elementary school children participating.
