    Xinhua News Agency, Prague, June 21st: Czechoslovak Government Premier Zapotocky received the Chinese delegation attending the Second World Federation of Trade Unions Congress at the Czechoslovak Trade Union Building on the morning of the 17th. Czechoslovak Trade Union Vice-Chairman Kypra, General Secretary Koresky, and International Minister Gabolika accompanied him. The Chinese delegation was represented by Liu Ningyi and five others. The Czechoslovak Premier stated that the great victory of the Chinese people was a serious blow to the reactionary forces of imperialism and gave the Czechoslovak people great encouragement. He hoped that the people of the two countries would unite more closely and develop economic construction. Liu Ningyi, in addition to expressing his gratitude, also expressed his willingness to learn from the Czechoslovak working class's experience in economic construction. Zapotocky immediately expressed his willingness to provide all assistance, and the Czechoslovak Trade Union has already made specific arrangements. It is reported that the Chinese delegation will visit coal mines and other enterprises before departing for Italy.

    Another dispatch: The founding conference of the World Leather Workers' Industry Department, convened by the World Federation of Trade Unions, will open on June 20th in Gottwaldov, the location of the famous "Bata" leather factory in Czechoslovakia. The Chinese leather workers' representative Dai Guowen and ten others departed from Prague on the 19th to attend.

    Xinhua News Agency, Prague, June 21st: The Italian government is obstructing the Chinese workers' delegation from attending the World Federation of Trade Unions Congress in Italy. When the news of the Chinese workers' delegation's arrival in Prague was warmly welcomed by democratic trade unions from various countries, it also aroused the jealousy of international reactionaries. Although the Chinese delegation has twice gone to the Italian Consulate in Czechoslovakia to apply for entry procedures, there have been no results. The Chinese delegation will continue to argue on just grounds. The World Federation of Trade Unions and the Italian General Confederation of Labor have also directly lodged representations with the Italian government to ensure that the Chinese delegation can participate in the Milan conference of world workers' unity on time.

    捷总理萨波托斯基招待我职工代表团
    意政府竟图阻我代表团赴会
    【新华社布拉格二十一日电】捷克斯洛伐克政府总理萨波托斯基十七日上午在捷职工会大厦招待出席第二次世界工联代表大会的中国代表团。由捷职工会副主席祁普罗、总书记柯尔斯基、国际部长加保力克等作陪。中国代表团由刘宁一等六人出席。捷总理表示，中国人民的伟大胜利，是对帝国主义反动势力的严重打击，同时给捷人民以莫大的鼓舞，他希望两国人民更亲密地团结起来，发展人民的经济建设。刘宁一除表示谢意外，并表示愿向捷工人阶级学习经济建设的经验。萨波托斯基当即表示愿予一切协助，捷职工会并已作具体布置，闻中国代表团在首途赴意大利前，将前往煤矿等企业参观。
    又讯：世界工联会所召集的世界皮革工人产业部成立大会，将于六月二十日在捷克著名的“拔佳”皮革工厂所在地哥特瓦尔德城开幕。中国皮革工人代表戴国文等十人于十九日从布拉格起飞前往出席。
    【新华社布拉格二十一日电】意大利政府正在阻挠中国职工代表团前往意大利出席世界工联代表大会。当中国职工代表团到达布拉格的消息受到各国民主工会的热烈欢迎时，也受到了国际反动派的嫉恨。中国代表团虽已两度前往意驻捷领馆交涉入境手续，但都没有结果。中国代表团将继续据理力争。世界工联与意大利总工会，亦已直接向意大利政府提出交涉，务使中国代表团能准时参加世界工人团结的米兰大会。
