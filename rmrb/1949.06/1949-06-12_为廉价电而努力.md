　　Strive for Cheap Electricity
    Currently, the majority of citizens are concerned about one issue: striving to use cheap electricity. Liu Ding, Deputy Director of the North China Enterprise Department, also emphasized at the first expanded meeting of the North China Electric Power Company the call for "no waste, able to conserve, in order to gradually achieve reduced electricity costs." We know that since the liberation of Beiping, the work of the electricity industry has made great progress. The phenomenon of power outages has almost disappeared, more power is being sent than in the past, and coal consumption has also decreased compared to the past. These are all achievements of the hard work and diligent efforts of the vast number of employees. In order to meet the demands of the majority of citizens, and to enable our work to make further progress, we would like to offer a few more suggestions for all parties to consider.
    To reduce electricity prices, costs must be reduced. To reduce costs, we must: first, have good machinery and equipment; second, have good operation and control; and third, have good business management. If these three things are done well, we can reduce costs and lower electricity prices. This requires all electricity workers to carry forward the spirit of hard work and diligent effort of the past, to take good care of the machines so that they have few or no failures, and to study their work diligently to operate the old machines we have taken over with high efficiency. Taking Beiping as an example, the machines are still the same as before liberation, but the efficiency is much better than before liberation, proving that our technicians and workers have made efforts. However, the electricity industry is a public utility and is closely related to everyone in the city. If we cannot mobilize all users and citizens to actively participate in business management, we still cannot do it completely well. Taking Ping, Tianjin, Tangshan and Zhangjiakou as an example, the current amount of electricity stolen or leaked averages 20 to 30 percent of the total power generated. Ping, Tianjin, Tangshan and Zhangjiakou generate approximately 1.92 million characters of electricity per day. At a theft/leakage rate of 20 percent, this equals 384,000 characters, and at one jin of rice per character, this represents a daily loss of 384,000 jin of rice. This loss is borne by all electricity users, and the accumulated amount over the year is considerable.
    To eliminate theft and leakage, the company itself must have strict administrative management and strengthen inspection, verification and repair work; this is one aspect. On the other hand, we should also call on the masses to actively participate in inspection and protection work. It is very easy for electricity thieves to deceive the company's inspectors, but they cannot deceive relatives, friends and neighbors. Stealing electricity is originally a very immoral behavior, and people are either used to it, or they are too embarrassed to ask about it when they see it, which was not surprising in the past. Now the situation is different. Everyone has a share in public utilities, and everyone has a responsibility to protect them. Bad people steal electricity, and good people pay for it. If the company cannot catch them, everyone will have to bear the burden equally. Therefore, when you see someone stealing, you should step forward to dissuade them. If dissuasion fails, you should immediately report them righteously and confidently. This is for everyone, and also for yourself. We should support those who report, criticize those who are accused, and supervise and help each other. The majority of citizens should also pay attention to checking for electricity leakage. It is easy for electricity to leak when it rains, and wires often leak due to disrepair over the years. Whoever sees it should report it to the electric company for repair as soon as possible. This can avoid waste and prevent fires. The company should inspect the lines on a regular and planned basis, and external line workers should be enthusiastic and responsible, so that with the help of citizens, the damaged lines can be gradually repaired.
    The electricity price in Shijiazhuang used to be higher than in Beiping, but now it is lower than in Beiping, because the phenomenon of theft and leakage has been reduced. The experience of Shijiazhuang is to mobilize the masses to discuss this issue, understand its relationship to their own interests, and then formulate methods, supervise and implement them mutually. Those who stole electricity no longer stole, and the leaks were repaired. As theft and leakage decreased, the amount of electricity relatively increased, the number of users increased, and the electricity price became cheaper. This experience can be learned from by cities such as Ping, Tianjin, Tangshan and Zhangjiakou.
    Beiping is a city with a large population and less industry. Every night from 7 pm to 10 pm, every household turns on the lights, using a lot of electricity. Even when the machines are running at full capacity, they still feel that the supply is not meeting the demand. During the day and after 12 pm, residents use less electricity, and most of the workers and machines are idle, which is also a great waste. Tianjin has already begun to make necessary adjustments, mobilizing some factories to use electricity in the second half of the night as power, with a particularly cheap price, while appropriately saving electricity in the first half of the night. This is a good way to avoid congestion and idleness, and other places can also adopt it.

### 为廉价电而努力

专栏：短论

　　为廉价电而努力
    目前广大市民都在关心着一个问题：争取使用廉价电。华北企业部刘鼎副部长在华北电业公司第一次扩大会议上，也着重提出了“不浪费、能节约，以求逐步达到减低电费”的号召。我们知道，北平解放后，电业工作已经有了巨大的进步，停电的现象几乎已经消灭了，电力发送得比过去充分了，煤的消耗量也比过去减少了，这都是广大职工辛勤创造、努力工作的成绩。为了满足广大市民的要求，使我们的工作能够百尺竿头更进一步，我们愿意再提几点意见，供各方面参考。
    要想减低电价，必须降低成本。要想降低成本，必须作到：第一、机器装备要好；第二、运转操纵要好；第三、经营管理要好。这三件事情作好了，就能降低成本，减低电费。这就要依靠全体电业职工，发扬过去辛勤创造、努力工作的精神，妥为看管机器，使其不出或少出故障；努力研究业务，把我们接收来的陈旧机器，高效率地运转起来。以北平而论，机器还是解放前的那一些，效率却比解放以前好多了，证明我们的技术人员和工人是努了力的。但是，电业是一种公用事业，和城市的每一个人都有密切的关系，如果不能动员所有用户、市民积极参加经营管理，还是不能完全作好的。以平、津、唐、张而论，现在偷漏电量平均为发电总量的百分之二十到三十。平、津、唐、张每日发电约合一百九十二万字。按偷漏百分之二十计，合三十八万四千字，每字一斤米，每天损失三十八万四千斤米。这笔损失由全部用电户负担，全年累集起来是很可观的。
    消灭偷漏现象，从公司本身来说，要严密行政管理，加强检视稽查与修理工作；这是一方面。另一方面，还应号召群众起来，积极参加检查与保护工作。偷电者瞒过公司的检查人员非常容易，但无法瞒过亲戚朋友和街坊邻居。偷电原是一种极不公德的行为，人们有的习以为常，有的碍于情面看见了也不过问，在过去是难怪的。现在情况不同了，公用事业人人有份，大家都具保护之责，坏人偷电，好人出钱，公司查不住，就要大家平均负担。所以看见有人偷，应该出面劝阻，劝阻无效，马上理直气壮的予以告发，这是为了大家，也是为了自己。我们应该支持告发者，批评被告者，互相监督，互相帮助。广大市民应该同时注意检查漏电现象，下雨时容易漏电，电线因年久失修也常漏电，不管谁看见了，都应该赶快报告电气公司修理。既可以避免浪费，又可以防止火灾。公司则应按期有计划地检查线路，外线工人尤应热心负责，以便在市民协助下，逐步把损坏了的线路修好。
    石家庄过去的电费比北平高，现在比北平低，就是因为减少了偷漏现象。石家庄的经验是发动群众讨论这个问题，认识这个问题对自己的利害关系，然后定出办法，互相监督执行，偷电的不偷了，漏电处修好了。偷漏减少，电量相对增加，用户从而增多，电费就便宜了。这个经验，平、津、唐、张等城市都可吸取。
    北平是个居民多、工业较少的城市。每晚七时至十时，家家开灯，用电特多，机器开足马力，还感供不应求。白天和夜晚十二时以后，居民用电少了，工人、机器大部分闲起来，这也是一种很大的浪费。天津已开始作了必要的调整，发动部分工厂利用后半夜的电力作动力电，价钱特别便宜，在前半夜则适当节用。这是个避免拥挤和空闲的好办法，其他各地也可采用。
