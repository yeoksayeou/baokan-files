　　Report of the Chinese Delegation to the World Congress of Advocates for Peace in Paris-Prague

　　I.

    From April 20th to 25th, 1949, the grand, solemn, and historically significant World Congress of Advocates for Peace was held simultaneously in Paris, the capital of France, and Prague, the capital of Czechoslovakia. The total number of participants in both locations reached 2,005, bringing together representatives from 72 countries and 10 international organizations. These included the most outstanding and distinguished individuals from all walks of life – workers, farmers, youth, women, literature, science, art, and religion – representing over 600 million organized people determined to fight for people's democracy and lasting peace.
    The congress conducted five full days of discussions in a harmonious, united, enthusiastic, and resolute atmosphere. On the final day, it adopted a common declaration and joint resolutions, and elected a standing committee to be responsible for promoting future work.
    To express support for the congress and to stage a major demonstration against imperialist warmongers, Czechoslovakia held a rally of 70,000 people, and Paris organized a large parade of 500,000 people during the congress.

  　II.

    For more than three years, from 1946 to the present, the US imperialism has desperately used various means to deliberately create the terror of new wars in order to achieve its aggressive intentions of outward expansion, so as to postpone or evade the arrival of its domestic economic panic. It has torn up the United Nations Charter, launched a frenzied arms race, deployed a network of military bases in every corner of the world, constantly propagated and provoked war, and promoted the Truman Doctrine and the Marshall Plan, instigating the conclusion of military alliance treaties such as the Brussels Pact and the North Atlantic Treaty. As a result of the implementation of these policies, the atmosphere of international coordination has been completely destroyed, and the crisis of a Third World War is becoming more serious day by day. This is undoubtedly an unbearable threat to the "people of the world whose wounds from the Second World War are still fresh," and the people cannot but be concerned about peace, and gradually understand that they should unite and rise up to defend peace.
    At the same time, as a result of the implementation of these policies, the sovereignty and independence of many countries have suffered enormous damage, and many nations have become vassals enslaved by US imperialism. For example, the Marshall Plan promoted by US imperialism in Europe has led the economy of Western Europe to a dead end, making the living standards of the general public increasingly lower, and making the national economies of those "recipient countries" increasingly lose their independence and autonomy, and increasingly dependent on US imperialism. For example, the US imperialism's aid to Chiang Kai-shek in China, to the reactionary dynasty in Greece, and to the Dutch and French imperialists in their military offensives in Indonesia and Vietnam, has caused the people in these places to suffer greatly from the ravages of war. Recently, the North Atlantic Treaty, which was directed by the US imperialism, openly abolished the sovereignty of all the contracting countries except the United States, giving the US imperialism complete freedom to arbitrarily interfere in the internal affairs of various countries (Article 4 of the North Atlantic Treaty). These many situations have made the people of various countries intimately recognize another truth: that defending peace is inseparable from defending the national independence of one's own country, and that it is two aspects of one task.
    Thus, with the increasingly rampant war cries of the imperialist bloc, with its increasingly brutal attack on the lives of the people, and with its increasingly obvious trampling on the independent and autonomous rights of all nations, the people of the world have also increasingly universally and forcefully launched a great struggle against war and for peace. First of all, the working classes of various countries have united and risen up, severely condemning war propaganda in the World Federation of Trade Unions, raising the banner of "Defending Peace," and supporting the Soviet Union's peaceful and just diplomacy. Next, the world's outstanding and advanced intellectuals also gathered in Poland in late August last year, and decided to establish an international liaison committee specifically to mobilize all peace-loving people around the world, to unite them and organize them, in order to more effectively combat the schemes of the warmongers and fundamentally overcome the war crisis. Next, the International Democratic Women's Federation, organized by women around the world who demand democracy and progress, also gave a warm response. Next, proletarian political parties in countries all over the world successively issued declarations, announcing to the world that they opposed any imperialist war of aggression, and openly declared without hesitation or ambiguity: "If the imperialists dare to launch a war, the working classes of various countries will resolutely stand on the side of the Soviet Union, which loves peace and has consistently pursued a policy of peace."
    It was under such circumstances that the world movement to strive for peace and defend peace developed to a new climax, and then the International Liaison Committee of the World Congress of Intellectuals for Peace, jointly with the International Democratic Women's Federation and world-renowned individuals from seventeen countries, jointly issued a call on February 25th to initiate, prepare for, and convene this World Congress of Advocates for Peace, to seek specific and effective ways to defend peace.
    After this call was issued, it immediately received a broad, spontaneous, and enthusiastic response from the people all over the world. In just two months, more than 600 million people expressed their support, and many countries not only sent representatives to participate in the meeting, but also organized various mass rallies and parades, using these demonstrations to express their support.
    When this call was transmitted from Madame Eugénie Cotton, president of the International Democratic Women's Federation, through Cai Chang, president of the Chinese Democratic Women's Federation, to the Chinese people, various people's organizations in China held gatherings and issued declarations, agreeing with the resolution to convene the World Congress of Advocates for Peace, and each dispatched representatives to form the "Chinese Delegation to the World Congress of Advocates for Peace," which set off on March 29th to participate.
    The list of the Chinese delegation is as follows: All-China Federation of Trade Unions: Liu Ningyi, Ouyang Zurun, Ye Weimin; All-China Democratic Women's Federation: Li Dequan, Ding Ling, Gong Pusheng, Lu Cui, Wu Qing; Preparatory Committee of the All-China Youth Federation: Qian Junrui, Chen Jiakang; All-China Students' Federation: Ke Zaishuo, Qu Yuan; All-China Federation of Literary and Art Circles and North China Federation of Literary and Art Circles: Guo Moruo, Tian Han, Hong Shen, Zheng Zhenduo, Cao Yu, Cao Jinghua, Xiao San, Gu Yuan, Xu Beihong, Cheng Yanqiu, Dai Ailian; Chinese Association of Scientific Workers: Ma Yinchu, Deng Chumin, Jian Bozan, Hou Wailu; Chinese Association of Scientific Workers: Lu Yudao, Pei Wenzhong, Ding Zuan, Qian Sanqiang; Representatives of Professors from Peiping and Tientsin: Zhang Xiruo, Xu Deheng; China Liberated Areas Journalists Association and China Youth Journalists Society: Huan Xiang, Huang Caoliang, Ge Baoquan; Shanghai People's Organizations Federation: Xu Guangping, Ge Zhicheng; Representatives of Progressive Christians in China: Wu Yaozong. The delegation also publicly elected Guo Moruo as the head of the delegation, Liu Ningyi and Ma Yinchu as deputy heads, and Qian Junrui as secretary-general.
    The breadth of the aspects included in this list proves that the Chinese people have indeed demonstrated a united desire and determination to defend peace.

  　III.

    The exceptionally powerful momentum of the peace movement reflected during the preparation for the World Congress of Advocates for Peace caused the imperialist camp to panic. The reactionary governments of Britain, the United States, and France used every despicable trick to obstruct the convening of the congress and weaken its influence.
    While the congress was still being prepared, the reactionary newspapers of the United States, Britain, and France, under the manipulation and direction of the big bosses on Wall Street, unanimously slandered the World Congress of Advocates for Peace, insisting that it was a "Moscow trick." However, the eyes of the working people of the world are bright. Defending world peace is by no means a trick, but instigating a new world war is a trick. The Soviet Union has always been a fortress of peace, and the Soviet Union's policy of peaceful diplomacy, which has been pursued for 30 years, has always been a beacon for the people of the world. In fact, in addition to the representatives of the working people of the world, those attending this World Peace Congress also included Mr. John Rogge, former Assistant Attorney General of the United States, Father K. Moore, a famous American bishop, Mr. H. Moore, former Lord Chancellor of England, Dr. Johnsen, the Archbishop of Canterbury in England, and Father Briant, a French Catholic priest. Even the former Queen Mother of Belgium, French Admiral Musele, sent a telegram to the congress expressing her support. Simply citing these few names, isn't the imperialists' shameless rumor-mongering already self-defeating?
    Since spreading rumors and lies did not work, the imperialists adopted two more despicable and vile means to carry out sabotage. First, because they dared not openly oppose peace, they came up with an outlandish "mix the genuine with the fake" method to confuse society. In mid-April, initiated by scholars employed by US and British imperialists and leaders of reactionary trade unions, a so-called "International Day of Resistance to War and Dictatorship" was also scheduled to be held in Paris on April 30th, vainly attempting to use this gathering, attended by only a few dozen reactionary secret agents, to deceive us about the peace congress supported by 600 million people. The British pro-fascist philosopher Russell, the American reactionary trade union leader Dubinsky, the reactionary proponents of "cosmopolitanism" and "world government" Gary Davis, the most reactionary philosopher of so-called "existentialism" Sartre... are all dogs used by the imperialists. Their stinking reputations and the heresies they advocate have long been exposed to the people of the world and have long lost the trust of the people of the world. Obviously, such a gang of foxes and dogs cannot play a major role and cannot deceive the world.
    The second means of the imperialists is the political high-handedness that they have always used. The US "House Un-American Activities Committee" threatened the American representatives attending the Paris Congress, falsely accusing them of being "foreign spies," and forcing them to voluntarily abandon their intention to go to France. The British Home Office also threatened and pressured Dr. Johnsen, the Archbishop of Canterbury, forcing Dr. Johnsen to finally declare that he was willing to renounce his British citizenship. General MacArthur, the Supreme Commander of the US occupation forces in Japan, simply and directly issued an administrative order prohibiting progressive Japanese people from going abroad to participate in the Peace Congress.
    In coordination with this reactionary policy of the United States, the reactionary French government under the control of Wall Street also suddenly issued a "general restriction order" more than ten days before the opening of the Paris Congress (April 8th), only "allowing eight representatives from each country to arrive in Paris." Everyone knows that according to last year's "Brussels Pact" and the agreement between the United States and France, people from the United States and the Brussels Pact countries can enter France without going through entry visa procedures. Therefore, the Gu Yi government's "restriction order" was actually issued specifically for the Soviet Union, China, and the people's democratic countries of Europe and Asia.
    This unreasonable measure taken by the reactionary French regime to curry favor with its American masters aroused the anger of the people all over the world. Protest telegrams flew to Paris from all directions like snowflakes. The French people particularly expressed their opposition, and various people's organizations issued declarations condemning the frivolity and shamelessness of their own reactionary government, and criticizing it for "violating the will of the French people and staining the glorious revolutionary tradition of the French people."
    In addition to only allowing eight Chinese representatives to enter France in accordance with its so-called "general restriction order," the reactionary French government also instructed its consulate general in Prague to propose additional special conditions, requiring the Chinese delegation to have a formal letter explaining to the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs why the entry visas for these eight representatives were not processed at the French consulate in Peiping or Tianjin, and requiring the formalities to be completed by telegram to the French consulate in Peiping and Tianjin. In other words, the reactionary French government hoped to use the permission for the entry visas of these eight representatives as a deal, in exchange for the Chinese people's de facto recognition of the former status of French imperialism in China.
    The Chinese delegation, based on the laws of the North China People's Government, only knew that there were a considerable number of French nationals residing in the Peiping and Tianjin areas under the protection of the people's government, and did not know of the existence of any French diplomatic representative institutions. Therefore, it was impossible to accept the requirements put forward by the reactionary French government. After several negotiations, the French side still insisted on not allowing it, only agreeing to change the "formal letter" to "verbal explanation." The Chinese delegation believed that the unreasonable conditions of the French side were clearly intended to make things difficult, so that the Chinese delegation could not arrive in Paris in time for the meeting. Therefore, on April 19th, it issued a statement severely condemning the French government's "act of hostility towards the Chinese people," and at the same time guaranteed that "the Chinese delegation is willing to unite with peace-loving people all over the world – including the French people who have a glorious tradition of democracy and revolution – at any time and in any place, to jointly strive to eliminate the crisis of a new war and strive for lasting peace."
    The representatives of seventeen countries who could not enter Paris due to such restrictions and obstructions by the reactionary French government, at the joint suggestion of the Chinese and Soviet delegations and with the consent of the Preparatory Committee of the Paris Congress, finally decided to hold the congress in Prague at the same time as the Paris Congress. That is to say, one World Congress of Advocates for Peace was held in two venues, with the same agenda for discussion and the same resolutions and declarations adopted; and both meetings formally announced that they recognized "the Prague Congress as an integral and indivisible part of the Paris Congress," and that the representatives participating in the Prague meeting should be immediately regarded as representatives participating in the Paris Peace Conference. In this way, the peace-loving people of the world shattered the imperialist's despicable attempt to sabotage the congress with active and offensive actions, and added infinitely magnificent momentum and greater political significance to the entire world peace movement.

  　IV.

    According to the suggestions of the preparatory committee, there were seven main topics for discussion at the congress: "(1) Condemn the arms race; (2) Expose war propaganda; (3) Explain the relationship between the UN Charter and peace; (4) Emphasize respect for the sovereignty and independence of all countries; (5) Oppose all enslavement plans, and establish normal economic relations between countries; (6) Encourage women to participate in the international movement to defend peace; (7) Suggest the establishment of permanent peace institutions." All the speeches in the congress were centered around these seven major topics. Every speech can be said to be a head-on blow to the warmongers.
    All the important speeches in the Paris and Prague venues were mutually transmitted through tape recorders and radio. The speeches of Curie, chairman of the Paris Congress, Nenni, head of the Italian delegation, and Fadeyev, head of the Soviet delegation, and the mother of the famous heroine Dan Niang, as well as the singing of the famous American black singer Robeson, could be heard at the Prague venue. Similarly, the Paris venue could also hear the speeches of Děrda, chairman of the Prague Congress, Guo Moruo, head of the Chinese delegation, and Simonov of the Soviet Union. At the same time, through film, representatives of the two places were able to meet as if they were in the same hall, and the reactionaries' conspiracy did not achieve their goal of sabotaging the congress.
    Almost all the delegations from the seventy-two countries delivered speeches at the congress. By synthesizing and analyzing these speeches, we can obtain the following noteworthy points.
    First, we can hear such words from the speeches of various representatives at all times: "Defending world peace is defending national independence and the democratic system," "Defending peace is defending the fruits of victory won through great hardship in the Second World War - freedom from being enslaved." We can also often hear such words: "Intensifying the construction of our people's democratic country is defending world peace"; or "Intensifying our colonial liberation struggle is also defending world peace." These words show that "defending world peace" is by no means an abstract thing, nor is it an empty slogan, but has extremely rich and definite content, because it is completely consistent and completely combined with the vital interests of the people of all countries around the world.
    We have also repeatedly heard such speeches: "Our holding such a congress of this nature this time is not to ask the war camp for peace, but to force them to accept our peace." Several representatives (France, Italy, Britain, the Netherlands, etc.) shouted loudly: "We should establish a world organization to stop war; when necessary, we will not hesitate to take revolutionary action to prevent war!" What a magnificent spirit and a grand momentum!
    Also, from the speeches of more than a dozen representatives (Professor Curie of France, Nenni, leader of the Left-wing Socialist Party of Italy, Zilliacus of the Left-wing Labour Party of Britain... etc.), we also heard such words: "War and imperialism are inseparable from capitalism, just as peace and true democracy are inseparable from socialism and communism"; or "Capitalism is historically doomed to decline, and only the realization of a socialist world can guarantee lasting world peace."
    These speeches clearly reflect that the political consciousness of the people has been developed to such a high degree that this congress has the full possibility of raising the original mere desire for peace to a new and higher stage, making it a conscious and organized mass political movement, and at the same time laying a more solid, more practical, and more convenient-to-act foundation for the peace forces that have already surpassed the war camp. After this congress, there is no doubt that the struggle to defend peace will be carried out more widely, more actively, and more forcefully, act, move towards a new climax, and move towards a new victory!
    Second, this congress, from beginning to end, was permeated with a confidence that "the struggle to defend peace will surely win." Almost every representative's speech must say: "We firmly believe that victory will surely belong to our peace and democracy camp." Why is there such full confidence? According to the analysis of the representatives' speeches, the first is of course because everyone deeply believes that the people's peace power far exceeds the imperialist war power, because the former represents progress and represents democracy and freedom, so it can be supported by hundreds of millions of people, while the latter represents retrogression and represents enslavement and plunder, so it must be isolated and helpless, outwardly strong but inwardly weak. Secondly, in the people's democratic peace camp, there is the powerful Soviet Union as the leader, its socialist system, which has been tested and proven to be most in line with human ideals, its increasingly strong and consolidated political and economic construction, its strong and excellent armed forces, its peaceful diplomatic policy that plays the role of a horn around the world, and finally its great and wise leader, who is also the greatest revolutionary teacher of all mankind, Stalin - these guarantee the certain victory of the world peace struggle. Replicating this, the counter-revolutionary war waged by imperialism in China to aid the reactionary forces has been tragically defeated. The victory of the Chinese revolution will destroy imperialism's chains in the East, portending the colonial system will soon be overthrown and eliminated. The victory of the Chinese People's Liberation War not only changed the balance of power between the war camp and the peace camp in the entire world, but also provided the people of the world with a vivid, very concrete, and very realistic example - "Imperialism is a paper tiger," "It is not impossible to defeat." Replicating this again, over the years the people's democratic countries of Europe and Asia, under the leadership of the people's front with the proletarian party as the core, have indeed seen their political power becoming increasingly consolidated, their economies advancing by leaps and bounds, and the living standards of their people generally improving. All kinds of ironclad facts have proved that even the people's democratic system, as a transition to socialism, is indeed a thousand times superior to the decadent and declining capitalist system. Most recently, based on the various historical lessons from the Second World War to the present, the people of various countries have gradually learned, and are continuing to learn, how to unite themselves and each other, to control their own destiny, and to create their own future. The degree of awakening of the people of the world today is universally higher than it was ten years ago. With awakening, it is not easy to be divided and weakened by the imperialists' conspiracies and tricks. With unity, power will naturally be generated, and with power, there will naturally be confidence.
    Because of these many factors, the last paragraph of the congress declaration calls on the people of the world: "Be brave, be brave, and be more brave to fight for world peace! We know how to unite with each other and understand each other. We have preparation, we have methods, and we also have determination. In our great struggle for peace and for survival, we will surely win victory." The congress's call resounded throughout the world. In the face of the role this call plays on the masses, all the gold on Wall Street and all the atomic bombs in Oak Ridge appear so pale and weak!
    Third, precisely because of the existence of the above two major factors, this congress was able to form a peace united front that is unprecedentedly broad and strong in the world. This can be fully illustrated by the unanimous resolution of the congress to establish a permanent institution. Our great people's leader Mao Zedong once instructed us: "Any revolution cannot succeed without a very strong proletarian party as the leader"; at the same time, on the other hand, "Any revolution cannot succeed without a very broad united front, striving to win over and unite the progressive people from all walks of life as much as possible, and isolating the enemy as much as possible." The process of the Chinese revolution fully proves the brilliance and correctness of Chairman Mao's instruction. Looking at this World Congress of Advocates for Peace in the same principle, we can say that a world-wide powerful peace united front with the great Soviet Union as the core and the soon-to-be-victorious China as the backbone has already appeared on the horizon. In the speeches of countless representatives, this point was openly pointed out. The speeches of the representatives of the people's democratic countries, without exception, mentioned such a sentence: "We guarantee that we will faithfully and steadfastly stand forever in the peace and democracy camp led by the Soviet Union and with the increasingly powerful new democratic China as the mainstay, and fight together to the end." Most of the people's representatives from Western European countries said: "If the imperialists really dare to launch a war of aggression, we will resolutely stand on the side of the Soviet Union, which has consistently pursued a policy of peace." The people's representatives from North America also said: "The victory of the Soviet Union's peaceful diplomatic policy, the victory of the Chinese people's liberation struggle, the victory of the struggle of free Spain and democratic Greece - your victories are also our victories, because we are on the same front." These words symbolize that the world's peaceful united front is becoming increasingly consolidated and has unlimited potential. Therefore, the congress was able to unanimously resolve to organize a standing committee to "resolutely oppose and stop all anti-democratic and anti-national independent acts of aggression; oppose and defeat war propaganda; coordinate the activities between various countries, various nations, various local organizations, and even all individuals willing to work for peace, help them develop contacts, exchange information, and promote work."
    The world people's peace united front formed through this congress has already been joined by more than one-third of all mankind. This is a good start. If we can work harder in the future, it will not be difficult to do as Chairman Mao said, uniting 90% of all mankind to oppose the war-mongers who account for only 10% or less.

　　V.

    In this congress, the Chinese delegation, adhering to the instructions of the ten groups that sent us abroad, worked diligently and conscientiously. We prepared a total of ten speeches, each explaining the Chinese people's willingness and determination to fight for peace from the different perspectives of the represented groups. However, due to the short time of the congress and the large number of speeches, China, like the Soviet Union, only had five opportunities to speak. Guo Moruo, head of the delegation, Liu Ningyi and Ma Yinchu, deputy heads, and Li Dequan and Hong Shen, members of the delegation, all delivered speeches, which were all warmly welcomed by the entire congress. In particular, Guo Moruo's speech was generally considered to not only completely convey the will of the Chinese people, but also powerfully express the unity and strength of the Chinese people. He pointed out the world significance of the Chinese people's victory; used the experience of China's victory to prove that as long as the people of the world "unite and struggle firmly under the leadership of the conscious working class, they will surely be able to smash any military or political conspiracy of any tyrannical imperialist"; and finally clearly and affirmatively declared the Chinese people's belief: "Peace is a noble gift, it must have power to win it, and it must have power to maintain it. … The peace-loving people of the world must, internationally, be led by the Soviet Union, the fortress of peace, and, domestically, be led by the conscious working class, unite as one, fight resolutely, do not underestimate their own strength, and do not overestimate the enemy's strength… The united strength of the people of the world will surely defeat the instigators of aggressive war, overthrow the entire capitalist imperialist system, and enable all mankind to be liberated and obtain lasting peace for the people." His speech was unanimously recognized as one of the best and most powerful speeches in all the speeches of this congress.
    In participating in the activities inside and outside the congress for five days, we deeply felt the love between people and the high degree of internationalism and patriotism of the proletariat. The representatives attending this congress had four skin colors: yellow, white, brown, and black. Each representative always expressed a sincere attitude of respect and affection towards each other, and no one was discriminated against or treated coldly because of different skin colors. When the two radiant names of Stalin and Mao Zedong were mentioned, no one in the venue did not stand up and applaud and cheer for a long time. When the chairman of the congress mentioned the names of every heroic colonial nation in his opening speech on the first day, every representative present stood up and applauded unanimously, expressing a most sincere and sublime respect from the bottom of their hearts. When the news of the liberation of Nanjing was first transmitted to the Paris and Prague congress venues, the entire venue cheered and competed to congratulate the Chinese delegation, applauding, hugging, and kissing. Representatives from many countries were even so excited and grateful that tears flowed down their faces. That night, six or seven hundred Czech youths gathered in front of the hotel where the Chinese delegation was staying, shouting "Long live Mao Zedong" and "Long live democratic China" for three or four hours. These situations show that the working people of all countries in the world are so united, closely related, sharing weal and woe, and sharing success and failure in the great liberation struggle to overthrow the corrupt rule of capitalism and establish people's democracy and socialism. In particular, towards the Soviet Union and its great leader Stalin, the working people of all countries sincerely hold extremely deep gratitude, love, respect, and support. This is because the Soviet working people, under the leadership of Stalin, created a socialist social system and provided a vivid example of struggle for the working people of the world; and because the Soviet Union helped liberate many countries in the Second World War, and today stands at the forefront of the camp of peace and international security, constantly and unremittingly calling for and fighting against imperialism and defending the sovereignty and independence of various countries.
    Under such internationalism and people's friendship, the people of the world are increasingly strengthening their unity. Although imperialist warmongers have advocated some "racial superiority theories," extremely narrow "nationalism," "cosmopolitanism" that sacrifices the sovereignty and independence of various countries to obey the American hegemon, and fabricated nonsense such as "fifth columns," attempting to divide the people of the world in order to complete their old conspiracy of "divide and conquer," the various facts demonstrated by this peace congress prove that these labored and clumsy deceptive tricks have been seen through by the people today, and not many people will be fooled by them anymore.
    The internationalism we see is inseparable from patriotism. The people's representatives we encountered, some have already made themselves masters; others, although they are still in a state of being exploited and ruled, also deeply believe that they will one day turn over and control their own destiny. No matter what the situation is, no one does not have an extremely deep and sincere love for their motherland, their people, and their culture. This patriotism has today become a most powerful stimulus for them to carry out liberation struggles or nation-building struggles. Those countries that have established people's regimes, the masses of the people are using unprecedented tension and heroic efforts to defend their national independence, overcome economic backwardness, eliminate the remaining toxins of the decadent culture of capitalism, eliminate the reactionary elements lurking in the country and colluding with foreign countries, and promote the excellent national traditions of their own historical culture and art, hoping that their motherland can embark on the road of socialism and communism as soon as possible. The people of all countries who are still under the oppression and rule of imperialism or the bourgeoisie are seeking the early liberation of their motherland with a firm and resolute spirit of advancing wave upon wave and never resting, using various forms of struggle. When each representative talked about the achievements his country's people had made in the process of liberation or nation-building in his speech, the delegations of all countries felt the same glory and gave them the greatest respect. Under such circumstances, internationalism and patriotism are united without any gaps.
    The Chinese delegation held three press conferences in Prague, each of which received an extremely enthusiastic response. The members of the delegation also visited several people's organizations in the Soviet Union and Czechoslovakia, and were warmly welcomed everywhere. There is no doubt that China is one of the most valued and respected countries at this congress, and therefore the Chinese delegation is one of the most noticed and respected delegations. The trust or expectations that the people of the world place in China can be said to be unparalleled. The main reason for this is, of course, because "the great victory of the Chinese People's Liberation War has made a very huge contribution to the sacred cause of defending world peace." (Quoted from the speech of the Czech representative) Yes, the revolutionary war of the Chinese people and the struggle of the people of the world to uphold lasting peace are inseparable. Therefore, the Chinese delegation, both at the World Peace Congress and in all public and private visits outside the congress, has consistently made such a guarantee on behalf of our Chinese people: "The Chinese people will definitely make persistent efforts, under the leadership of the great people's leader Chairman Mao, to carry through to the end the victory of our revolutionary war, completely eliminate all open and hidden reactionary elements in the country, and completely expel all the remaining forces of imperialism from China. At the same time, after the victory of the revolutionary war, we will make redoubled efforts to quickly establish a consolidated people's democratic political and economic system, and under this system, we will quickly turn agricultural China into industrial China and backward China into advanced China, so that we can embark on the road of socialism as soon as possible. Only in this way can we guarantee lasting and genuine peace within China; only in this way is it the best way for the Chinese people to uphold lasting world peace. Only when China has complete and lasting peace can it truly weaken the power of imperialism in the East, encourage the billion colonial people to intensify their struggle for their own liberation, and fundamentally destroy the colonial slavery system of three hundred years; only when the colonial system is eliminated can the complete and lasting peace of the Far East be guaranteed, and the complete and lasting peace of the world can be guaranteed."
    Although the Chinese people are justified in being proud of the achievements they have made through their heroic struggle, we also know that, on the one hand, the victory of the Chinese revolution is mainly due to the efforts of the Chinese people with a high degree of political awakening, the correct leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, and the wise guidance of the great people's leader Chairman Mao, but on the other hand, we cannot in the slightest degree ignore the favorable international situation that has existed in recent years and is currently existing for China. Therefore, when we analyzed the reasons for the victory of our People's Liberation War to foreign people, we particularly emphasized the following four points of the international situation that gave tangible and intangible help to the Chinese revolution. "First of all, due to the defeat and collapse of the three fascist countries of Germany, Italy, and Japan, the ability and position of capitalist imperialism to rule the world has generally been greatly weakened and shaken. Secondly, the painful lessons since the Second World War have made the political awakening of the people of the world unprecedentedly heightened. The people's forces within various capitalist countries have greatly risen, and the ruling power of the bourgeois regimes has increasingly weakened. All imperialist countries are facing a frenzy of reform and democracy demanded by their own people, and feel at a loss, without much energy left to interfere in China's internal affairs. Thirdly, the policy of peace and democracy pursued by the Soviet Union after the war is an encouragement and a powerful support to the struggles of the people of the world, including the people of capitalist countries, China, and colonies, making the people's power more and more surging and stronger day by day. Fourthly, China's revolutionary war has not only received the greatest sympathy and support from the Soviet Union and the working people of the world, but has also received the sympathy and support from all righteous and progressive people within capitalist countries." We sincerely tell the world that without the existence of the above four favorable international factors, especially without the Soviet Union's most acute and merciless struggle against imperialism's policies of war and enslavement with its policies of peace and democracy, making the imperialists - especially US imperialism - flustered, the victory of the Chinese revolutionary war would probably be difficult to come as quickly and thoroughly as it has today. On the eve of the impending complete realization of the Chinese People's Liberation Movement, we wholeheartedly thank the people of the world - especially the people of the Soviet Union - for their support. We guarantee that in the sacred struggle to strive for lasting world peace and to seek the freedom and liberation of all mankind, we Chinese people will unswervingly stand in the peace camp led by the Soviet Union, and work hand in hand with the people of all people's democratic countries and all peace-loving and democratic people within capitalist countries to fight together to the end.

　　VI.

    The Chinese delegation's attendance at the World Congress of Advocates for Peace has indeed strengthened the momentum of the world movement to uphold peace and increased the strength of the people's peace camp. The reason why we were able to live up to our mission and achieve satisfactory results, we believe, should be attributed to the correct leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and the people's leader Chairman Mao; it should be attributed to the heroic and skillful combat of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, constantly creating new and brilliant victories; it should be attributed to the efforts of the Chinese working masses to produce and support the front, so that the revolutionary war can be carried out victoriously; it should be attributed to the great friendship between the two great nations of China and the Soviet Union. Without this friendship, it would have been impossible for the two delegations of China and the Soviet Union to cooperate so closely and seamlessly in this congress; it should be attributed to the enthusiastic help of the people's democratic countries - especially Czechoslovakia - enabling the entire congress to overcome countless technical difficulties.
    In order to more effectively promote and launch the movement to uphold world peace in China, and in order to more forcefully implement the resolutions of the congress in China, the Chinese delegation hereby suggests that the various people's organizations that sent us abroad to participate in the congress jointly initiate, in accordance with the decision of the congress, the organization of a "Chinese Congress of Advocates for Peace" to be responsible for contacting the standing committee of the World Congress of Advocates for Peace, and to materially and actively help and support all activities of the World Congress of Advocates for Peace.

　　出席巴黎——布拉格世界拥护和平大会中国代表团报告书
　　一
    一九四九年四月二十至二十五日，在法京巴黎和捷京布拉格，同时举行了盛大庄严而具有重要历史意义的世界拥护和平大会。参加人数，两地合计，共达二千零五名，集合了七十二个国家，十个国际团体的代表，其中包括各国工人、农民、青年、妇女、文学、科学、艺术、宗教各界最优秀杰出的人士，代表着六亿以上决心为人民民主及持久和平奋斗的有组织的人民。
    大会在和谐团结热烈坚决的气氛中，进行了五整天的讨论。在最后一天，通过了共同的宣言，共同的决议案，并且选出了一个常设委员会来负责推动今后的工作。
    为了表示对于大会的拥护，同时对帝国主义战争贩子大示威，在大会进行期间，捷克举行了七万群众的集会，巴黎组织了五十万人的大游行。
  　二
    自一九四六年以迄于今，三年多以来，为了尽量推迟或逃避其国内经济恐慌的到来，美帝国主义拼命使用各种手段，故意造成新战争的恐怖，以达成其向外扩张的侵略企图。它撕毁了联合国宪章，发动了疯狂的军备竞赛，在世界的每个角落布署军事基地网，不断宣传挑拨战争，推行杜鲁门主义及马歇尔计划，策动缔结布鲁塞尔公约和北大西洋公约之类的军事同盟条约。由于这些政策实施的结果，国际协调的空气被破坏无遗，第三次世界大战的危机一天比一天严重。这对于“第二次世界大战创痛犹新的全世界人民”，无疑地是一个难于忍受的威胁，人民因此不能不关切和平，逐渐了解应该一致奋起，来保卫和平。
    同时由于这些政策实施的结果，许多国家的主权和独立都受到了巨大的损害，许多民族都变成了美帝国主义奴役的附庸。譬如，美帝国主义在欧洲所推行的马歇尔计划，就把西欧的经济引到了绝路，使一般大众的生活水准愈益低落，使那些“受援国家”的国民经济日益丧失其独立自主性，而日益增加对美帝的依存性。又如，美帝在中国援助蒋介石，在希腊援助反动王朝，在印尼越南援助荷法帝国主义的军事进攻，就使这些地方的人民饱受战祸。最近，美帝导演已成的北大西洋公约，更公然取消了除美国以外各缔约国家的主权，给予美帝以任意干涉各国内政的完全自由（北大西洋公约第四条）。这许多情形又使得各国人民亲切地认识了另一个真理：保卫和平与保卫本国的民族独立，是分不开的，是一件任务的两个方面。
    于是，随着帝国主义集团日益猖獗的战争叫嚣，随着它那日益残酷的对人民生活的进攻，随着它那日益显明的对各民族独立自主权的蹂躏，全世界人民也日益普遍有力地展开了反对战争拥护和平的伟大斗争。首先是各国工人阶级一致奋起，在世界工联中，严厉谴责战争宣传，揭起“保卫和平”的大旗，拥护苏联的和平正义的外交。接着，全世界优秀先进的知识分子，也在去年八月下旬集会于波兰，决定成立国际联络委员会，事门从事于动员全世界一切爱好和平的人士，要把他们团结起来，组织起来，以便更有效地打击战争贩子的阴谋，从根本上克服战争危机。接着，全世界要求民主进步的妇女所组织的国际民主妇联，也加以热烈的响应。接着，全世界各国无产阶级政党先后发表宣言，昭告世界，反对任何帝国主义的侵略战争，并且毫不迟疑毫不含糊地公开声称：“万一帝国主义者敢于发动战争的话，各国工人阶级将毅然决然地与爱好和平、一贯推行和平政策的苏联站在一边。”
    就在这样的情形之下，世界争取和平、保卫和平的运动，发展到了一个新的高潮，于是世界知识分子保卫和平大会国际联络委员会，就联合国际民主妇联，及十七个国家的世界著名的个别人士，共同在二月二十五日号召发起、筹备并召开这次的世界拥护和平大会，来觅取保卫和平的具体有效方法。
    这一号召发出之后，立刻就得到全世界人民广泛的自发的热烈响应。仅仅两个月工夫，就有六万万以上的人民表示拥护，许多国家不仅派遣代表参加会议，而且还组织了各种群众性的集会游行，用这些示威行动来表示拥护。
    当这个号召由国际民主妇联主席戈登夫人，经过中国民主妇联主席蔡畅，转到中国人民之后，中国各人民团体纷纷举行集会，发表宣言，赞成召开世界拥护和平大会的决议，并且各自推派代表，组成“出席世界拥护和平大会中国代表团”，于三月二十九日启程出国参加。
    中国代表团的名单如下：中华全国总工会：刘宁一、欧阳祖润、叶维民；中华全国民主妇联：李德全、丁玲、龚普生、陆璀、吴青；中华全国青年联合会筹备委员会：钱俊瑞、陈家康；中华全国学联：柯在铄、屈元；中华全国文艺协会及华北文艺协会：郭沫若、田汉、洪深、郑振铎、曹禺、曹靖华、萧三、古元、徐悲鸿、程砚秋、戴爱莲；中国学术工作者协会：马寅初、邓初民、翦伯赞、侯外庐；中国科学工作者协会：卢于道，裴文中、丁钻、钱三强；平津教授代表：张奚若、许德珩；中国解放区新闻记者联合会及中国青年记者学会：宦乡、黄操良、戈宝权；上海人民团体联合会：许广平、葛志成；全国基督教进步人士代表：吴耀宗。代表团又公推郭沫若为团长，刘宁一、马寅初为副团长，钱俊瑞为秘书长。
    由这一名单所包括的方面之广泛，可以证明，中国人民的确是表现了团结一致拥护和平的愿望和决心的。
  　三
    世界拥护和平大会筹备期间，反映出来的异常壮大的和平运动的声势，使得帝国主义阵营慌张失措。英美法三国反动政府，为了阻挠大会的召开，以及削弱大会的影响，什么卑鄙的手腕都用尽了。
    当大会还在筹备的时候，美英法的反动报纸，在华尔街大老板们的操纵指使之下，异口同声地诬蔑世界拥护和平大会，硬说那是“莫斯科的鬼花样”。然而，全世界劳动人民的眼睛是明亮的，拥护世界和平决不是鬼花样，只是挑拨新的世界战争才是鬼花样。苏联一向就是和平堡垒，苏联三十年来所推行的和平外交政策，一直是世界人民的灯塔。事实上，出席这次世界和平大会的在全世界劳动人民的代表之外，还有美国前任司法部次长约翰·罗杰先生，有美国著名的主教Ｋ·摩尔顿神父，有英国前司法大臣Ｈ·穆尔先生，有英国的坎特伯里主教约翰笙博士，有法国天主教的布里言教士，就连前比利时皇太后法国海军上将慕涉尔都致电大会表示拥护。仅仅举这几个名字，帝国主义的无耻造谣，不就已经不攻自破了吗？
    造谣说谎既不生效，于是帝国主义者就采用两种更卑鄙下流的手段，来实行破坏。第一、因为它们不敢公然反对和平，所以就异想天开地搞出一种“鱼目混珠”的办法，来混淆社会祝听。四月中旬，由美英帝国主义者的御用学者和反动工会的领袖们发起，也预定于四月三十日在巴黎举行一个所谓“抵抗战争与独裁的国际日”，妄想用这个仅仅只有几十百把个反动特务分子参加的集会，以假乱真地来蒙混我们有六亿人民拥护的和平大会。英国亲法西斯哲学家罗素、美国反动工会领袖杜宾斯基、反动的“世界主义”和“世界政府”的提倡者加利台维斯、法国最反动的提倡所谓“存在主义”的哲学家沙台尔……都是帝国主义所选用的走狗。他们臭秽的声名，和他们所提倡的那些邪说，老早已经在世界人民面前暴露得清清楚楚了，老早已经失掉了世界人民的信任了。很显然，这样一批狐群狗党，是决不可能发生多大作用的，是绝对欺骗不了世人的。
    帝国主义者的第二个手段，就是它们向来惯于采用的政治高压。美国“非美活动调查委员会”，对出席巴黎大会的美国代表们加以恐吓，诬指他们为“外国间谍”，迫令他们自动放弃前赴法国的意图。英国内政部也对坎特伯里主教约翰笙博士，威胁压迫，逼得约翰笙博士终于不能不声明情愿放弃英国国籍。美国驻日占领军最高统帅麦克阿瑟，则公然干脆以行政命令，不准日本进步人士出国参加和平大会。
    与美国的这种反动政策相配合，在华尔街支配之下的法国居伊反动政府，也在巴黎大会开幕之前十多天（四月八日），突然发表“一般性的限制令”，只“许每个国家有八个代表到达巴黎”。大家都知道，根据去年的“布鲁塞尔公约”以及美法两国之间的协定，美国以及布鲁塞尔公约国家人民进入法国，是可以无需办理入境签证的手续的。因此，居伊政府的这个“限制令”，实际上是专为苏联、中国及各欧亚人民民主国家而发。
    法国反动政权为了取媚美国主子而采取的这种无理措施，引起了全世界人民的愤怒。抗议的文电雪片也似地从四处飞往巴黎。法国人民特别表示反对，各人民团体纷纷发表宣言，谴责其本国反动政府的无聊无耻，指斥其“违背了法国人民的意志，沾污了法国人民光荣的革命传统”。
    法国反动政府对中国代表团的入境，除依照其所谓“一般性的限制令”只允八个中国代表入境之外，还指示其驻捷京总领事馆提出附带特别条件，要求中国代表团具备正式函件，向法国外交部说明为什么不在北平或天津法国领事馆办理这八位代表的入境签证的原因，并且要求用电报向平津法领事馆补办手续。换句话就是说，法国反动政府希望拿这八个代表入境签证的许可，做一笔买卖，换取中国人民对于法帝国主义在华原有地位的事实承认。
    中国代表团根据华北人民政府的法令，只知道平津一带，在人民政权的保护之下，驻有相当数目的法籍侨民，而不知道有任何法国外交代表机构的存在，因此，对于法国反动政府所提的要求，根本无法接受。几经交涉，法方仍然坚持不让，仅允把“正式函件”改作“口头说明”。中国代表团认为法方这种无理条件，显然是有意刁难，使中国代表团不能如期赶到巴黎开会，于是在四月十九日发表声明，严厉谴责法国政府“这种敌视中国人民的行为”，同时保证“中国代表团愿意在任何时间，任何地方，联合全世界爱好和平的人民——其中当然包括具有民主与革命的光荣传统的法国人民——共同奋斗，消除新战争的危机，争取持久的和平。”
    因受法国反动政府这种限制与阻挠而不能进入巴黎的十七国代表，在中苏两国代表团共同建议之下，经过巴黎大会筹备委员会的同意，最后决定在巴黎大会举行的同时，也在布拉格举行大会。这就是说一个世界拥护和平大会，分成两个会场举行，讨论的议程是一个，通过的决议和宣言也是一个；并且两个会议都正式宣布，承认“布拉格大会为巴黎大会的完整不可分的部分”，参加布拉格会议的代表应即认为参加巴黎和会的代表。这样一来，全世界爱好和平的人民就以主动的攻势的行动，粉碎了美英法帝国主义阴谋破坏大会的卑鄙企图；替整个世界拥护和平运动增加了无限壮阔的声势和更重大的政治意义。
  　四
    这次大会讨论的议题，根据筹备委员会的建议，最主要的一共有七个：“（一）谴责军备竞赛；（二）揭破战争宣传；（三）说明联合国宪章与和平的关系；（四）强调尊重各国主权及独立；（五）反对一切奴役计划，国家与国家之间应建立正常的经济关系；（六）鼓励妇女参加保卫和平的国际运动；（七）建议建立永久性的和平机构。”大会中的所有发言，都是围绕着这七大议题的。每一个发言，对于战争贩子们都可以说是一种迎头的痛击。
    巴黎和布拉格两个会场上所有的重要发言，都经过录音机和无线电相互传播。巴黎大会主席居里，义大利代表团长南尼和苏联代表团长法捷也夫及著名女英雄丹娘的母亲等的演说，以及著名美国黑人歌唱家罗布森的歌唱，在布拉格会场上可以听到。同样，巴黎的会场上，也可以听到布拉格大会主席得尔达、中国代表团长郭沫若、苏联代表西蒙诺夫的演说。同时，通过电影，使二地代表，如同晤对一堂，反动派的阴谋并没有达到他们破坏大会的目的。
    几乎七十二国家的代表团，都在大会上发表过演辞。综合并分析这些发言，我们可以得到下面这样几个值得注意的要点。
    第一、我们从各个代表的发言中，时时刻刻可以听到这样的话：“保卫世界和平就是保卫民族独立和民主制度”，“保卫和平就是保卫第二次世界大战，经过千辛万苦所获得的胜利果实——免于被奴役的自由”。我们也常时可以听到这样的话：“加紧建设我们的人民民主国家，就是保卫世界和平”；或者“加紧我们的殖民地解放斗争，也就是保卫了世界和平”。这些话语说明，“保卫世界和平”决不是抽象的东西，也决不是空洞的口号，而是具有极丰富确实的内容的，因为它已经同全世界各国人民切身攸关的生存利益，完全一致，完全结合起来了。
    我们又屡次听到过这样的发言：“我们这次举行这样一个性质的大会，不是为了向战争阵营要求和平，而是为了要强迫它们接受我们的和平”。有好几位代表（法、义、英、荷等）大声疾呼地说：“我们应该建立一个世界性的组织，来制止战争；必要的时候，我们将不惜以革命的行动来防止战争！”这是多么雄伟的气魄和壮烈的声势啊！
    还有，从十好几位代表（法国的居里教授、义大利的左翼社会党领袖南尼、英国的左翼工党齐利亚库斯………等）的演说中，我们还听到这样的话：“战争和帝国主义是与资本主义分不开来的，正如同和平和真正民主是与社会主义和共产主义分不开来的一样”；或者“资本主义在历史上是注定快要没落了，只有实现了社会主义的世界才能保障世界的持久和平。”
    从这些演辞中，很清楚地反映出：人民的政治觉悟已经发扬到了这样高的程度，使得这次大会有充分可能，把原来仅仅是一种要求和平的热望，提到一个新的更高的阶段，使成为一种有自觉性的、有组织的群众政治运动，同时也替那原已超过了战争阵营的和平力量，打下一个更坚牢、更踏实、更便于行动的基础。经过这次大会之后，毫无疑问，保卫和平的斗争，将要更广泛、更积极、更有力地开展起来，行动起来，走向新的高潮，走向新的胜利！
    第二、这次大会，从头到尾，都贯彻着一种“保卫和平的斗争必然胜利”的信心。几乎每一位代表的发言，都一定要说一句：“我们坚决相信，胜利必然是属于我们和平民主阵营的”。为什么会有这样充分的信心呢？根据代表们的发言来分析，首先当然是由于大家都深深相信，人民和平的力量远远超过帝国主义战争的力量，因为前者代表进步，代表民主自由，所以能得到亿万人民的拥护，后者代表倒退，代表奴役与掠夺，所以一定是孤立寡助，外强中干。其次，在人民民主和平阵营中，有强大的苏联为领导，它的历经试验屡被证明为最符合于人类理想的社会主义制度，它的日益壮大巩固的政治经济建设，它的雄厚优良的武装力量，它的在全世界起着号角作用的和平外交政策，最后还有它的伟大英明的领袖同时也是全人类最伟大的革命导师斯大林—这些就保证了世界和平斗争事业的一定胜利。复次，帝国主义援助反动派在中国进行的反革命战争，业已惨遭失败。中国革命的胜利将要摧毁帝国主义在东方的锁练，预示殖民地制度不久将被打倒消灭。中国人民解放战争的胜利不仅改变了战争阵营与和平阵营在整个世界范围内的力量对比，而且向全世界人民提供了一个活生生的，非常具体、非常现实的例证——“帝国主义是纸老虎”，“不是不可以击溃的”。再次，欧亚各人民民主国家几年来，在以无产阶级政党为核心领导的人民阵线主政之下，的确政权日益巩固，经济突飞猛晋，人民生活水淮普遍改善，种种铁的事实证明了，纵使是作为到社会主义的过渡的人民民主制度，也确实是个千百倍优越于那腐朽了的即将没落的资本主义制度。更次，根据第二次世界大战以迄于今的各种历史教训，各国人民已经逐渐学会了，并且还在继续学习如何自行团结，并且互相团结起来，自己掌握自己的命运，自己创造自己的前途。全世界人民今天觉醒的程度，比较十年以前是普遍地提高了。有了觉醒，就不容易为帝国主义的阴谋诡计所分化、所削弱，有了团结自然就能产生力量，有了力量自然也就有了信心。
    由于这许多因素，所以大会宣言的最后一段才号召世界人民说：“勇敢些勇敢些，再勇敢些为世界和平而奋斗！我们知道如何互相团结，互相了解。我们有准备，有方法，也有决心。在我们为和平为生存的伟大斗争中，我们一定能赢得胜利”。大会这个号召，响遍了全世界，在这号召对群众所起的作用面前，华尔街所有的黄金、橡树岭所有的原子弹，独显得何等地苍白而柔弱啊！
    第三、正因为有了上面两大因素的存在，所以这次大会才能形成一个世界上前所未有的广泛而坚强的和平联合阵线。这一点，从大会一致通过决议成立常驻机构上可以充分说明。我们伟大的人民领袖毛泽东曾经指示我们：“任何革命如果没有一个十分坚强的无产阶级政党为领导，那是不能够成功的”；同时在另一方面，“任何革命，如果没有一个十分广泛的联合阵线，把进步的各阶层人士尽量争取过来，团结起来，把敌人尽量孤立起来，那也是不能成功的。”中国革命的过程，充分证明了毛主席这一指示的英明正确，在同样原则之下来看这次世界拥护和平大会，我们可以说，一个以伟大的苏联为核心，以即将胜利的中国为中坚的世界性的强有力的和平联合阵线，业已在地平线上出现了。在无数代表的发言中，都公开指出了这一点。人民民主国家代表们的发言，没有一个人不提这样一句话：“我们保证，一定要忠实坚贞地永远站在以苏联为首并有日益强大的民主新中国为砥柱中坚的和平民主阵营中，共同奋斗到底。”西欧各国的人民代表们则大多数都说：“万一帝国主义者果真敢于发动侵略战争的话，我们将毅然决然与一贯推行和平政策的苏联站在一边。”来自北美的人民代表也说：“苏联和平外交政策的胜利，中国人民解放斗争的胜利，自由西班牙及民主希腊的斗争的胜利——你们的这些胜利也就是我们的胜利，因为我们是在一条战线上的。”这些话语象征着全世界和平联合战线日臻巩固，并且有无限大的潜能。所以大会才能够一致决议组织一个常务委员会，来“坚决反对并制止一切反民主反民族独立的侵略行为；反对并击破战争宣传；调协各个国家、各个民族、各个地方性社团乃至一切愿意为和平而努力的各个个别人士之间的活动，帮助他们发展联系，交换情报，推动工作。”
    经过这次大会而形成的世界人民和平联合战线，已经有了全人类的三分之一以上参加。这是一个很好的开始。如果今后能够更加努力，那就不难做到象毛主席所说的那样，团结全人类的百分之九十，来反对那仅仅只占百分之十还不到的战争贩子了。
　　五
    中国代表团在这次大会中，秉承着推派我们出国的十个团体的指示，兢兢业业，黾勉将事。我们一共准备了十篇发言，每篇都从所代表团体的不同角度来说明中国人民愿意为和平而奋斗的意志和决心。但是，由于大会时间的短促，发言的众多，中国只能与苏联一样，有五个发言的机会。团长郭沫若、副团长刘宁一、马寅初，团员李德全、洪深，都发表了讲辞，都受到了全会场的热烈欢迎。特别是郭沫若的演辞，一般认为不仅很完整地传达了中国人民的意志，而且也有力地表现了中国人民的团结和力量。他指出了中国人民胜利的世界意义；用中国胜利的经验证明只要全世界人民“在觉悟的工人阶级领导之下，团结一致，坚强斗争，就一定能够粉碎任何横暴的帝国主义者的军事上或政治上的阴谋”；最后明白肯定地宣示了中国人民的信念：“和平是一个高贵的礼物，它必须有力量才能够赢得，也必须有力量才能够维持。……全世界爱好和平的人民，在国际一定要以和平堡垒苏联为领导，在国内一定要以觉悟的工人阶级为领导，团结一致，坚决斗争，不过低估计自己的力量，不过高估计敌人的力量……全世界人民团结的力量一定可以打败侵略战争挑拨者，推翻整个资本帝国主义制度，使全人类获得解放，获得人民的永久和平。”他的演说被一致公认为这次大会所有发言中最好最有力的演辞之一。
    在参加大会五天的会内会外活动中，我们深深感觉到人民与人民之间的热爱，和无产阶级国际主义与爱国主义的高度发扬。出席这次大会的代表，有黄白棕黑四种肤色。每个代表相互间，总是表示一种由衷的崇敬亲热的态度，决没有任何一个人因肤色不同，而受到歧视或冷淡的。当提到斯大林毛泽东这两个光芒万丈的名字的时候，会场没有一个人不起立，不长时间鼓掌、欢呼。当大会主席在第一天开幕致辞中提到每一个英勇斗争的殖民地民族的名字的时候，每个在场的代表都一致起立鼓掌，从内心中发出一种最诚挚最崇高的敬意。当南京解放的消息初次传到巴黎和布拉格大会会场的时候，全场欢呼，争向中国代表团致贺，鼓掌，拥抱，接吻，有许多国家的代表甚至兴奋感激得双泪交流。当天晚上，六七百个捷克青年群集中国代表团所住的旅馆门前，高呼“毛泽东万岁”，“民主中国万岁”，历时三四十分钟之久。这些情形说明了，全世界各国的劳动人民，在推翻资本主义腐朽统治、建立人民民主及社会主义的伟大解放斗争中是这样团结一致，休戚相关，胜败与共的。特别是对苏联，及其伟大领袖斯大林，各国劳动人民都由衷地怀抱着极深度的感激、爱敬和拥护。这一则是因为苏联劳动人民在斯大林领导之下，创造了社会主义的社会制度，替全世界劳动人民提供了一个活生生的斗争范例；二则是因为苏联在第二次世界大战中曾帮助解放了许多国家，今天又站在和平与国际安全阵营的最前列，持续不懈地为反对帝国主义、保卫各国主权与独立而呼吁，而奋斗。
    在这样的国际主义和人民友爱之下，世界各国人民正日益加强其团结。帝国主义战争贩子们虽曾倡导一些“种族优越论”，极端狭隘的“民族主义”，牺牲各国主权独立以服从美国霸主的“世界主义”以及捏造的什么“第五纵队”之类的胡说八道，企图分化世界人民，以便完遂其“分而治之”的一套老阴谋，可是，由这次和平大会所表现的各种事实证明，这些心劳日拙的障眼法，今天已被人民识破，没有多少人再会上它们的鬼当了。
    我们所看到的国际主义是与爱国主义分不开来的。我们所碰到的人民代表，有的已经自己作了自己的主人；有的虽然目前还在被榨压被统治的状态下，可是也都深信自己终有一天会翻过身来，自己掌握自己的命运。不论在什么样的情况下面，没有一个人不对自己的祖国、自己的人民和自己的文化有着极其深刻真挚的热爱，这种爱国主义今天已成为他们进行解放斗争或建国斗争的一种最强有力的刺激因素。那些已经建立了人民政权的国家，人民大众正以史无前例的紧张情绪和英勇努力，来保卫自己的民族独立，克服经济上的落后，肃清资本主义腐朽文化的残余毒素，扫除潜伏在国内与外国勾结的反动分子，发扬本国历史文化艺术的优良民族传统，希望自己的祖国能早日走上社会主义及共产主义的道路。那些还在帝国主义或资产阶级压迫统治下的各国人民，则正以前仆后继，不胜不休的坚决果敢的精神，运用各种各样的斗争方式来谋求自己祖国的早日解放。当每个代表在发言中讲到他本国人民在解放斗争或建国过程中所得到的成绩时，各国代表团都感受到同样的光荣，并寄予以最大的崇敬。在这样的情形之下，国际主义与爱国主义就相合无间的统一起来了。
    中国代表团在布拉格举行过三次记者招待会，每次都得到极热烈的响应。代表团的团员们也曾分别访问过苏捷若干人民团体，到处都受到盛大的欢迎。毫无疑问，中国是这次大会中最受重视最受尊崇的国家之一，因而中国代表团也就是最受注意和爱敬的代表团之一。全世界的人民对于中国所寄予的信任或期待，真可说是无比深厚。这主要的原因，当然是由于“中国人民解放战争的伟大胜利，对保卫世界和平的神圣大业有了十分巨大的贡献。”（捷克代表发言中语）是的，中国人民的革命战争与世界人民的拥护持久和平的斗争，原是无法分割的。所以，中国代表团在世界和平大会席上，以及在会外的所有公私访问中，一直代替我们中国人民，提出了这样的保证：“中国人民一定再接再厉，在伟大人民领袖毛主席领导之下，把我们革命战争的胜利贯彻到底，把国内一切公开的潜伏的反动分子全部肃清，把一切帝国主义的残余势力完全驱逐出中国。同时还要在革命战争胜利之后，以加倍的努力迅速建立巩固的人民民主的政治经济制度，并在这种制度之下，迅速把农业的中国变成工业的中国，把落后的中国变成进步的中国，以便早日走上社会主义的道路。必须如此，才能保证中国国内的永久真正和平；必须如此，才是中国人民拥护世界持久和平的最好方式，只有中国有了彻底持久的和平，才能真正削弱帝国主义在东方的力量，鼓舞十亿殖民地人民加紧争取自己的解放，根本摧毁三百年来的殖民地奴役制度；只有殖民地制度被消灭了，远东的彻底持久和平才能获得保障，世界的彻底持久和平也才能够获得保障。”
    中国人民对于自己英勇奋斗所获得的成绩，虽足引以自慰，可是，我们也知道，中国革命的胜利，一方面固然主要是由于有了高度政治觉醒的中国人民的努力，中国共产党的正确领导和伟大人民领袖毛主席的英明指引，他方面也不能丝毫忽视近年来以及当前对中国有利的国际形势。因此，在我们对外国人士分析我们人民解放战争的胜利原因的时候，我们特别强调下面这四点国际形势所给予中国革命的有形无形的帮助。“首先，由于德义日三个法西斯主义国家的战败崩溃，资本帝国主义对世界的统治能力和地位，一般的讲来，是已经大大削弱动摇了。其次，由于第二次大战以来的种种惨痛教训，使得全世界人民的政治觉悟空前提高，各资本主义内部的人民力量大大抬头，资产阶级政权的统治力量日益衰微，所有帝国主义国家都面临着本国人民要求改革要求民主的狂潮，而感到手足失措，没有太多的余力来干涉中国的内政。第三，苏联在战后所推行的和平民主外交政策，对于全世界人民包括资本主义国家，中国以及殖民地人民的斗争，都是一种鼓励，一种有力的支援，使人民力量一天比一天昂扬，一天比一天壮大。第四，中国的革命战争不仅得到苏联以及全世界劳动人民的最大同情与支援，而且也得到资本主义国家内一切正义进步人士的同情与支援。”我们很诚恳地告诉世界人士说，如果没有上面这四个国际的有利因素存在，特别如果没有苏联的和平民主政策对帝国主义战争奴役政策作最尖锐无情的斗争，把帝国主义——特别是美帝国主义——弄得手忙脚乱，那么中国革命战争的胜利恐怕是很难来得象今天这样迅速而彻底的。在今天中国人民解放运动即将完全实现的前夜，我们由衷心地感谢世界人民——尤其是苏联人民——对我们的声援。我们保证，在争取世界持久和平，谋求全人类自由解放的神圣斗争中，我们中国人民将坚贞不渝地站在以苏联为首的和平阵营中，与各个人民民主国家的人民，以及资本主义国家内一切爱好和平民主的人民，紧紧携起手来，共同奋斗到底。”

    中国代表团这次出席世界拥护和平大会，确实壮大了世界拥护和平运动的声势，并增加了人民和平阵营的力量。其所以能够不辱使命，获得圆满结果，我们认为应该归功于中国共产党和人民领袖毛主席的正确领导；应该归功于中国人民解放军的英勇善战，不断创造新的光辉胜利；应该归功于中国劳动大众的努力生产，支援前线，使革命战争能够胜利进行；应该归功于中苏两大民族的伟大友谊，没有这种友谊，中苏两个代表团是不可能得在这次大会中这样亲密无间地合作的；应该归功于人民民主国家——特别是捷克斯拉夫——的热烈帮助，使整个大会能够克服无量数的技术性的困难。
    为了更加有效地在中国推动并展开拥护世界和平的运动，为了更加有力地在中国执行大会决议案，中国代表团谨在此建议，并即由推派我们出国参加大会的各个人民团体，共同发起，遵照大会的决定，组织“中国拥护和平大会”负责与世界拥护和平大会常设委员会联系，并在物质上行动上帮助、支持世界拥护和平大会的一切活动。
