　　Great Soviet People's Writer
  　Gorky Thirteenth Anniversary of Death Commemoration
    USSR·谢尔宾那
    Gorky's great image towers over the boundary of our country's two historical periods. The literary activities of the petrel of the socialist revolution marked a new era in the artistic development of all mankind. The voice of the genius writer resounded throughout the world. In his creations, he engraved the birth of the new socialist era.
    When continuous proletarian revolutionary movements began in Russia, Gorky stepped onto the literary stage. "Song of the Petrel," "Song of the Falcon," "Mother," and other works reflected the people's desire for freedom and revolutionary struggle, and called on the people to rise up and fight.
    The creations of the genius proletarian writer were closely linked to the growth of our country's revolutionary movement. This great offspring of the great people spoke of the hopes and aspirations of the broadest working masses. Gorky's works not only paid attention to artistic skills and knowledge of people's lives, but also permeated the most advanced revolutionary ideas. Gorky brought new and valuable contributions to the treasure house of world culture, while also exerting a powerful influence on the minds and hearts of millions of people. Molotov said in his speech on Gorky: "The influence of Gorky's artistic language on our revolutionary destiny is more direct and powerful than that of any other of our writers. Therefore, in the eyes of the working people in our country and throughout the world, Gorky is the true founder of proletarian and socialist literature..."
    When commenting on Gorky's creations, Lenin always emphasized his great role in social development. "You have brought such great contributions to the workers' movement in Russia—not just one Russia—with your artistic genius..." Lenin said in a letter to Gorky. The great leader of the proletariat pointed out that Gorky "firmly linked himself with the Russian and worldwide workers' movement with his great artistic works..."
    The birth of a new socialist society, new relationships, and new people, unknown in human history, were significantly expressed in Gorky's works. All of his creations were subordinate to the idea of socialist transformation of reality. He praised the revolutionary fervor of the people and the heroic actions in patriotic achievements.
    Gorky was the inheritor of the excellent traditions of advanced classical literature. At the same time, he opened up new paths. His activities represented a great revolutionary transformation in artistic creation. In world literature, the new method of creation—socialist realism—is linked to Gorky's name.
    Gorky himself said that socialist realism, which forms the characteristics of all Soviet literature, is a reflection of the socialist creative facts produced by labor practice.
    Gorky became the world's greatest artist because in his works, the most advanced—the heroic deeds, aspirations, and emotions of the Russian revolutionary working class—and the most progressive ideas were revealed.
    Lenin talked about the unbreakable combination of Gorky's artistic works and the advanced forces of the times. Still in the early days of the Russian socialist movement, when this movement had only just sprouted, Gorky foresaw the guarantee of the future prosperity of the motherland. And when socialism triumphed, Gorky's talent was revealed even more profoundly. This writer sought the foundation of his creative methods in Lenin's thought, believing that the description of life should be "not in a static, but in a dynamic state, that is, not in a fixed situation but in motion... In terms of motion, it should be observed not only from the past perspective, but also from the future perspective..."
    During the Soviet period, the constant themes of this writer's creations, criticisms, and political commentaries were all the new things realized in our country after 1917. Gorky wrote in "On Reality": "The cause of our writers is an arduous and complex cause, which not only requires criticism of the old reality... Their task is to study, visualize, describe, and thus affirm the new reality."
    The foundation of the new socialist literature was laid by Gorky under the direct ideological influence of Lenin and Stalin. Under the ideological influence of Lenin's thoughts on the great liberation mission of the Russian working class, Gorky created outstanding images of revolutionaries in his works. The image of the revolutionary proletariat was embodied for the first time in the history of world literature in the play "The Petty Bourgeoisie." In the character of the mechanic Nil, the author affirmed the rights of the common people who were despised and insulted at the time, but the author firmly believed that these common people should own the land. The characteristics of Russian Bolshevik revolutionaries were excellently portrayed in the images of Pavel Vlasov, Andrei Nakhodka, Sintsov, Gutuzov, and Ryabin. The image of the Russian female worker Nilovna—Pavel Vlasov's mother—is full of rich content. It was precisely in the novella "Mother" that Gorky spoke of his ideal for the future Russia as the ideal of "the most bright and democratic land."
    The images of revolutionaries created by the great writer are lofty and heroic. These images reflect the excellent characteristics of the people fighting for their own happiness. These images permeate great charm and creative revolutionary fervor. Regarding this, Comrade Stalin said in "The Russian Social Democratic Party and its Nearest Tasks": "... Great fervor is only produced by great goals." The active heroes in Gorky's works are united by the great goals of liberating the people and building socialism.
    Gorky's creation is characterized by a fighting spirit and an effort to connect his art with the revolutionary activities of the masses. With the true enthusiasm of a patriot, he subordinated his creation to the urgent task of the people's liberation struggle. His classic work, the novella "Mother," is the artistic embodiment of the ideas described by Lenin in his famous work "What Is To Be Done?"
    Soviet writers who seek to embody the excellent characteristics of the people in their creations continue to develop Gorky's traditions. At the center of Soviet literature exists the heroic image of the socialist fighter.
    The innovative significance of Gorky's works and Soviet literature is clearly demonstrated in the ability to create convincing and vibrant affirmative images, which is unattainable by bourgeois art.
    In his creations, Gorky realized those principles that are the characteristics of the literature of the future socialist society, which Lenin brilliantly pointed out in his article "Party Organization and Party Literature" in 1905: "This will be free literature, because it is not fame and profit, but socialist ideas and sympathy for the working people, that will gather new and new forces into the literary camp."
    The source of strength of the artist Gorky is socialist ideology, the Party spirit of the Bolsheviks. (Jun Qiang translated from the March 28, 1949, issue of Pravda)

　　伟大的苏维埃人民作家
  　高尔基逝世十三周年纪念
    苏联·谢尔宾那
    高尔基的伟大形象高耸在我国两个历史时期的境界上。社会主义革命的海燕的文学活动，在全人类的艺术发展上标明了一个新的时代。天才作家的声音响彻了全世界。他在自己的创作里，刻划下了社会主义新纪元的诞生。
    当在俄罗斯开始了无产阶级的连续的革命运动时，高尔基走上了文坛，“海燕歌”、“鹰之歌”、“母亲”和其他的作品，反映了人民的爱自由的企望和革命的斗争，并且号召人民起来斗争。
    天才的无产阶级作家的创作，是和我国革命运动的成长紧密地联系着的。这位伟大人民的伟大子孙，说出了最广大劳动群众的希望和企图。高尔基的作品不仅注意到艺术的技巧和人民生活的知识，而且还渗透了最先进的革命思想。高尔基给世界文化的宝库带来了新的珍贵的贡献，同时在千百万人们的理智和心灵中，给与了有力的影响。莫洛托夫在其论高尔基的演说中曾说过：“高尔基的艺术语言的影响，对于我们的革命命运，比我们任何其他作家的影响都更直接、更有力。因此，在我国和在全世界劳动者眼里，无产阶级的、社会主义文学的真正鼻祖正是高尔基……”
    列宁在评论高尔基创作时，总是强调他在社会发展中的巨大作用。“你以你的艺术家的天才带给了俄罗斯——不仅一个俄罗斯——的工人运动以这样巨大的贡献……”—列宁在给高尔基的信上曾这样说过。无产阶级的伟大领袖曾指出，高尔基是“以自己的伟大艺术作品，把自己和俄罗斯的以及全世界的工人运动牢固地联系起来了……”
    在高尔基的作品中显著地表现出了人类历史还不知道的新的社会主义社会、新的关系、新的人们的诞生。他的全部创作都服从于社会主义改造现实的思想。他歌颂人民的革命热力和爱国业绩中的英勇行为。
    高尔基是先进的古典文学优秀传统的继承者。同时他还开拓了新的道路。他的活动表示了艺术创作中的革命的大转变。在世界文学中，新的创作方法——社会主义的现实主义——是和高尔基的名字联系着的。
    高尔基自己曾说过，形成全部苏维埃文学特色的社会主义现实主义，是劳动实践所产生的社会主义创造事实的反映。
    高尔基之成为世界最伟大的艺术家，是因为在他的作品中，显露出了最先进的——俄罗斯革命的工人阶级的英勇事迹、企望和情感，和现在最进步的思想。
    列宁曾谈到关于高尔基的艺术作品和时代的先进力量，牢不可破的结合。还是在俄罗斯社会主义运动的初期，当这运动还只冒出了一点幼芽的时候，高尔基就预见到祖国未来的繁荣的保证。而当社会主义胜利了的时候，高尔基的才力就显露得更深刻了。这位作家在列宁的思想中，寻求出了自己的创作方法的基础，认为描写生活应该“不是在静的，而是在动的状态中，亦即不是在固定的情况中而是在运动中……，就运动这一方面说，也不仅从过去的观点，还需从未来的观点去观察它……”
    在苏维埃时期，这位作家的创作、评论和政论的经常主题，就是我国一九一七年后实现的一切新事物。高尔基在“论现实”一文中写道：“我们文学家的事业，是艰巨而复杂的事业，它不仅要批评旧的现实……他们的任务是研究、具象化、描写。从而肯定新的现实。”
    新的社会主义文学的基础，是在列宁和斯大林直接的思想影响下，由高尔基奠定的。在列宁的关于俄罗斯工人阶级伟大的解放使命的思想影响之下，高尔基在自己的作品中，创造了卓越的革命者的形象。在世界文学史中，第一次体现出革命无产阶级的形象，是在“小市民”这个剧作中。在机器匠尼尔的身上，作者肯定了在当时还是被卑视被侮辱的平民的权利，但作者的坚信，这些平民，是应该占有土地的。俄罗斯布尔塞维克革命家的特征，被卓越地刻划在巴维尔·佛拉索夫，安德烈。那霍多克，辛错夫，古都作夫，拉比宁的形象里。俄罗斯女工尼洛甫娜—巴维尔·佛拉索夫的母亲—的形象，是充满着丰富的内容的。正是在中篇小说“母亲”中，高尔基说出了自己对未来俄罗斯的理想就是“最光明的民主之地”的理想。
    伟大作家所创造的革命家的形象，是崇高的、英勇的，在这些形象中，反映出了为自己幸福而斗争的人民的优秀特点。这些形象渗透了巨大的魅力和创造性的革命热力。关于这，斯大林同志在“俄罗斯社会民主党及其最近任务”一文中说过：“……伟大的热力，只是由于伟大的目的而产生的”。高尔基作品中的积极的英雄们，是被解放人民和建立社会主义的伟大目标结合起来的。
    高尔基的创作，是以战斗的特性和把自己的艺术与大众的革命活动连系的努力为其特色的。他以爱国者的真正热情，使自己的创作服从于人民解放斗争的迫切任务。他的古典作品的中篇小说“母亲”就是列宁在其名著“做什么？”一书中所述思想的艺术体现。
    希图在自己的创作中体现出人民的优秀特点的苏维埃作家们，继续发展着高尔基的传统。在苏维埃文学的中心，存在着社会主义战士的英勇形象。
    高尔基作品和苏维埃文学的革新意义，就在资产阶级艺术所达不到的，创造有说服力的和有生命力的肯定形象的能力方面明白地显示出来了。
    高尔基在自己的创作中，实现了作为未来的社会主义社会文学的特性的那些原则，列宁在一九○五年所作的“党的组织和党的文学”一文中，曾光辉地指出：“这将是自由的文学，因为不是名利，而是社会主义的思想和对劳动者的同情，将把新而又新的力量征集到文学阵营中去。”
    艺术家的高尔基的力量的泉源，就是社会主义的思想性，布尔塞维克的党性。（君强节译自一九四九年三月二十八日真理报）
