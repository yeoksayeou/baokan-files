    Bandit Special Agents' Plot to Bomb Yellow River Iron Bridge Foiled
    Main Culprit He Gongcheng and Others Arrested and Will Be Severely Punished
    [This newspaper dispatch] (Delayed) With high vigilance and active investigation, the Public Security Bureau of the Fourth Administrative Office of Taihang cracked a major case on the evening of April 14 involving a plot to bomb the Yellow River Iron Bridge, the Jiaozuo generator and locomotives, and to organize scattered bandits to assassinate our military and political revolutionary personnel. The seven principal criminals, He Gongcheng, Feng Juxiang, and others, have all been arrested, and the entire case has been thoroughly interrogated. In February, after accepting the aforementioned tasks from Zhang Yaowu, the head of the Xinxiang Bandit-Puppet Jinji Yu Border Region Special Agent Team, and Wei Hongjun, the station chief of the puppet Ministry of National Defense’s Yubei Station, the criminals immediately brought out 35 kilograms of yellow explosives, ten detonating tubes, three aerial detonators, and one No. 11 detonator from Xinxiang. They then went into hiding in the Kangcun, Jiahe, and Fengletun areas of Huojia, where He and Feng were responsible for directing their subordinate special agent pawns to carry out activities. They successively sent Chen Baoliang and Mu Xiaoguang to falsely participate in the work of our Jiaozuo Railway Station, attempting to take the opportunity to sabotage our Jiaozuo generators and locomotives. They also dispatched Lu Shengwen, Huang Kouxun, Du Youzhi, and others specifically responsible for bombing our Yellow River Iron Bridge and Zhengzhou locomotives, and were responsible for contacting former puppet bandit personnel in Jiaozuo, Huojia, Xiuwu, Yuanwu, and Yangwu, organizing their bandit armed forces to carry out looting and assassinations. By the time of the arrest, they had organized more than a hundred people, attempting to gather in Kangcun, Huojia, in late April and pull them to Xinxiang. However, thanks to the high degree of vigilance and resourcefulness of our Fourth Administrative Office Public Security Bureau, before the bandit special agents' insidious plot could be realized, they were uncovered on the evening of April 14, and more than sixty kilograms of explosives, ten detonating tubes, a fuse rope, two Mauser pistols, one "ten-shot" rifle, and sixteen bullets were seized. The People's Government has decided to severely punish the principal criminals in this case in accordance with the law.
