　　To Better Adapt Agriculture to Industrial Needs
       He Li
    Transforming agricultural China into industrial China is an important topic in new democratic economic construction. However, due to the constraints of the feudal economic tradition that has bound farmers for three thousand years, suddenly changing their self-sufficient economic life is still a very arduous task.
    An industrial country often requires the vast countryside to concentrate production for the needs of industrial raw materials. Wherever it is suitable for planting cotton, it requires universal cotton planting; wherever it is suitable for growing tobacco, it requires universal tobacco growing. Of course, in our new democratic country, the agricultural adaptation to industrial needs is not like the capitalists in capitalist countries—for the purpose of exploiting farmers, nor is it like the imperialist countries—for the purpose of plundering colonies, but for the purpose of developing both industry and agriculture. Under the conditions of mutual assistance and mutual benefit between agriculture and industry, agriculture provides raw materials for industry, and industry also helps agriculture produce machinery. However, to adapt agriculture to the needs of industry and to make appropriate division of labor in agricultural production in various places is the same, because only in this way can technology and output be improved. Our vast North China Plain is suitable for growing cotton, the sandy areas of Shandong and Hebei-Henan-Shandong are suitable for growing peanuts, Weifang on the Jiaoji Railway and Quwo on the Tongpu Railway are suitable for growing tobacco, and the area near the Yangtze River is suitable for planting hemp. In the future, they will all need to be planted in separate regions.
    However, the general farmers' plan is not like this. Their cultivation is planned according to the needs of their whole family's life. The vast majority of farmers do not dare to produce a large number of commodities. For example, in the case of an average of three and a half mu of land per person in North China, if a farming family has four people and fourteen mu of land, they have produced for a complete set of life according to the habits of previous years. They plan to plant several mu of wheat and autumn crops for the whole family to eat, plant one mu or half a mu of cotton for self-weaving and self-wearing, and only plan to produce a small amount of commodities if there is surplus land. This self-sufficient economy of theirs is in contradiction with our entire national economy. If this contradiction is not overcome, it will hinder the progress of industrial production.
    In the past, the imperialists and Chinese capitalists in China mainly grabbed or bought raw materials through landlords and rich peasants. They went to landlords and rich peasants to order goods, and one order was a very large amount. Of course, we cannot do this today, because with the feudal exploitation of landlords and rich peasants, productivity will not be improved. Our method is mainly to rely on cooperatives, establish supply and marketing relationships with rural cooperatives, and organize farmers through cooperatives to implement collective mutual assistance production on a private basis in order to solve this contradiction.
    To organize farmers to produce for industrial raw materials, the first thing to be solved must be to make farmers feel that there are reliable and higher profits when planting raw material crops, and make them feel that it is more beneficial to follow the country's plans than to follow their own plans. There are two issues here: First, there must be a relatively fixed ratio. For example, this year the North China People's Government stipulated that the minimum price of one jin of cotton can be worth eight jin of rice. If the market price is still higher in the future, it will be recovered at the market price. This is a very important measure. Farmers plant one mu of grain. According to the average output of North China, one mu of grain only harvests around one hundred jin of millet; while one mu of cotton averages twenty-five jin, which will yield at least two hundred jin of millet in the future. The price is stipulated in this way, so that farmers will not feel the threat of market prices. Of course, they will be willing to plant more cotton and less grain. But we still have to solve the second problem, which is exchange. We must enable farmers to fully exchange all kinds of necessities they need when they sell cotton. As for the farming family mentioned above, if his fourteen mu of land are completely planted with cotton, then he will feel that many things are lacking, and all of them need convenient transportation, and cooperatives for full supply and marketing. For example, in the past, many farming families in the Fenhe Plain in southern Shanxi specialized in growing cotton (Hongyu Zhaocheng) and tobacco (Quwo) because the local transportation has always been developed. Later, the Tongpu Railway was built, and they can buy their necessities at any time, so they dare to plant cotton with confidence; it is not easy to promote it in other areas with underdeveloped transportation, so we must develop transportation in the future.
    Secondly, we also need to improve farmers' planting techniques and improve crop varieties in order to suit the mass production of machines. Taking cotton planting as an example, local small-seed cotton is not as good as American cotton. Among American cotton, S cotton No. 2 and No. 4 are better. They not only have a 20% to 30% higher yield than local cotton, but also have long fibers, which are more suitable for machine weaving. Another point is that the cotton quality must be pure to ensure the uniformity of cotton fibers. It is difficult to fix the spindles if the machine-woven fibers are uneven; we have always not paid attention to this issue when organizing handicraft weaving in the countryside in the past. Originally, according to North China's plan this year, ten million mu of cotton will be planted, striving to produce three million dan of cotton (one dan is one hundred jin) to supply North China's own needs, which is not a big problem. The more than 300,000 spindles in various public and private cotton mills in Tianjin need about one million dan of raw cotton annually. In addition to handicraft weaving, they can meet the needs. However, due to technical immaturity, when sowing this year, the government lent seeds. Some staff members did not understand that various cotton seeds need to be stored and transported separately. As a result, the seeds of S cotton, fuzzless cotton, and local cotton were mixed up. This will not only prevent the cotton produced in the future from being used for machine weaving due to uneven cotton lint, but also affect the degradation of excellent varieties. Fortunately, it has not been long since sowing. During intertillage, cotton farmers should be guided to pick seedlings to make them as pure as possible. What is more important is the future acquisition work. At present, it is necessary to train a group of technicians and send them to various cotton-growing areas such as Pingjin, Langfang, Anyang, Baoding... to help rural cooperatives educate farmers on cotton harvesting and pressing techniques. One is to separate long-staple and short-staple cotton, and the other is to select excellent pure varieties to lay the foundation for cotton planting work next year. The most basic way is to implement science and technology in rural areas and make farmers aware of the importance of improving varieties and planting methods. In the future, the standard price of cotton should have grade differences. It cannot be generally eight jin of rice per jin of cotton. The price of good cotton should be high, and the price of bad cotton should be low, so as to promote farmers' interest in improving planting.
    Agricultural production must be combined with industrial production to ensure the gradual industrialization of China's economy. However, this work requires better unified leadership. Industrial, agricultural, cooperative, trade, transportation and other departments must cooperate to gradually realize it.

　　要更好的使农业适应工业需要
       贺笠
    把农业的中国变为工业的中国，这是新民主主义经济建设一个重要的课题，但是由于三千年来农民受着封建经济传统的束缚，骤然要改变他们自给自足的经济生活，还是一件非常艰巨的工作。
    一个工业国家，常常要求广大的农村为着工业原料的需要而集中生产。何地宜于植棉，它就要求那里普遍种棉；何地宜于种烟，它就要求那里普遍种烟。当然在我们新民主主义国家所要求的农业适应工业的需要，并不是象资本主义国家资本家那样——为的剥削农民，也不是象帝国主义国家那样——为的掠夺殖民地，而是为的使工业与农业都得到发展。在农业与工业互助互利的条件下，使农业为工业生产原料，工业也帮助农业生产机器。但是要把农业适应工业的需要，使各地的农业生产作适当的分工，这一点则是相同的，因为只有如此才能提高技术和产量。我们华北广大平原都宜于种植棉花，山东和冀鲁豫的沙土区宜于种花生，胶济线的潍坊和同浦线的曲沃宜于种烟草，长江附近宜于植麻，将来都需分区种植。
    但是一般农民的打算就不是如此，他们的耕作是按照着自己全家的生活需要而计划的，极大多数农民尚不敢于生产大量的商品。比如华北平均一口人三亩半地的情况，假如一个农家有四口人十四亩地，他们曾按照历年的习惯为着全套生活而生产，他计划着要种几亩麦几亩秋以供全家人吃，种一亩或半亩棉花以自织自穿，再有多余的土地才计划着生产少量的商品。他们这种自给自足经济，就与我们整个的国家经济发生矛盾，这种矛盾如不克服，就会障碍工业生产的进行。
    过去在中国的帝国主义者及中国资本家，他主要通过地主富农去为它攫取或收买原料。他们去向地主富农订货，一订就是一个很大的数额。当然我们今天不能这样作，因为有了地主富农的封建剥削，生产力是不会提高的。我们的办法主要是依靠合作社，与农村合作社建立供销关系，并通过合作社把农民组织起来实行在私有基础上的集体互助的生产，才能解决这一矛盾。
    要把农民组织起来为工业原料进行生产，首先要解决的，必须使农民在种植原料作物时感到有可靠的较高的利润，使他感到按照自己的打算不如按照国家的打算对自己更为有利。这里有两个问题：第一，必须有比较固定的比价，如今年华北人民政府就规定了最低一斤花可顶八斤米的比价，如将来市价还高，就按市价收回，这是很重要的措施。农民种一亩地的谷，按照华北平均产量，一亩谷只收一百斤上下小米；而一亩地的棉花平均收廿五斤，将来至少可得二百斤小米。这样规定了比价，使农民不致感到市场价格的威胁，当然他们就会愿意多种棉而少种谷。但是还得解决第二个问题，就是交换，要使农民出卖了棉花就能够完全换回自己所需的各种必需品。如上面所说的农家，他的十四亩地就以十亩或是完全种了棉花，那他就会感到许多东西缺乏，还都需要有便利的交通，并有合作社进行充分的供销。如晋南汾河平原过去有许多农家就专门种棉（洪渝赵城）种烟（曲沃），原因是当地交通素称发达，后来同蒲铁路修成，更可随时买到自己的必需品，所以他们也就敢于放心种棉；其他交通不发达的地区就不易推行，所以我们今后必须要发展交通。
    其次，我们还需要提高农民的种植技术，改良作物品种，才能适合机器的大量生产。以种棉来说，本地的小籽花就不如美棉，美棉当中更以斯字棉二号和四号为佳，它不仅产量较本地棉多收百分之二十到三十，而且纤维长，更宜于机器纺织。还有一点就是棉质要纯，才能保证棉花纤维的整齐。机器纺织纤维不齐就不好固定纱锭；我们过去在农村组织手工业纺织向来是不注意这一问题的。本来按照华北今年的计划种棉一千万亩，争取产棉三百万担（一担一百斤）的数量，供给华北本身需要，尚无多大问题。天津公私各纱厂三十余万纱锭，年需原棉约一百万担，除了手工业纺织，是可以满足需要的。但由于技术上的幼稚，今年在播种时，政府贷发种籽，有些工作人员不了解各种棉籽需要分别存放运输，结果把斯字棉、脱子棉、本地棉的种籽混乱了，这样不仅将来生产出来的棉花由于棉绒不齐不能用于机器纺织，还会影响到优良品种的退化。好在目前播种未久，中耕时应指导棉农拣苗，使其尽量纯净。更重要的是将来的收购工作，目前就需要训练出一批技术人员，在收棉时派到各植棉区如平、津、廊房、安阳、保定……等地，帮助农村合作社教育农民收花压花技术，一则使长绒短绒分开，再则选择优良纯种，为明年植棉工作打下基础。最基本的办法，是要把科学技术贯彻到农村去，使农民知道改良品种及种植方法的重要。将来棉花的标准价格，应有等级差别，不能一般地都是八斤米一斤花，好花价格应高，不好的花价格应低，如此才能促进农民改良种植的兴趣。
    必须把农业生产与工业生产结合起来，才能保证中国经济逐渐地工业化。不过这一工作需要有更好的统一的领导，工业、农业、合作事业及贸易，交通运输工作各部门，都必须协作一致，才能逐步实现。
