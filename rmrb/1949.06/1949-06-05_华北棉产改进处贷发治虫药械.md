　　North China Cotton Improvement Office Loans Insecticides and Equipment
    [Report from this newspaper] The North China Cotton Improvement Office is stepping up its pest control work. In the last twenty-odd days of last month, it cleaned up the received warehouses and mobilized employees to thoroughly check and sort out the sprayers and insecticides scattered in various warehouses. It made every effort to inspect and repair the scattered sprayer parts. As a result, 826 sprayers were repaired. Together with those cleared from the Tianjin, Beiping, and Langfang guidance districts, there were more than 1,500 complete sprayers. In terms of insecticides, more than 15,000 catties of wetting agents and more than 50,000 catties of contact insecticides were sorted out. Some of them, due to long storage, may have lost their effectiveness, and sampling is being carried out to test their efficacy. Those that are determined to be usable will be immediately distributed to the guidance districts and loaned to cotton farmers for pest control. The Beiping and Tianjin guidance districts and the Beiping Cotton Farm originally had a large number of insecticides and equipment in storage. After adjustments, they were distributed for use in the original units. It is also planned to distribute 100 sprayers and 2 hand-cranked powder sprayers each to the Heze, Linqing, Handan, Baoding, and Langfang guidance districts, as well as the Shijiazhuang guidance district of the North China Farm, along with rotenone powder, colloidal sulfur mixture, sublimed sulfur, 10% DDT powder, and rotenone extract. The above-mentioned large quantities of insecticides and equipment are now being actively packaged and distributed. The shipments to the Shijiazhuang and Handan districts have already been sent out, and the shipments to Heze and Linqing have also been loaded. The other regions are also scheduled to complete the shipments in the shortest possible time. The various insecticides and equipment issued are mainly for the prevention and control of cotton aphids and red spiders. The office also mobilized various regions to simultaneously adopt local methods as much as possible to supplement the shortage of insecticides and equipment, implement universal prevention and control, and strive to ensure that this year's improved cotton fields are not damaged by cotton aphids and red spiders.
