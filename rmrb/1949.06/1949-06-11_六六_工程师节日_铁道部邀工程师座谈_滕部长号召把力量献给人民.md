　　"June Sixth" Engineers' Day
    Ministry of Railways Invites Engineers to Symposium
    Minister Teng Calls on Them to Dedicate Their Strength to the People
    [This newspaper reported] The Ministry of Railways convened a symposium on "June Sixth" Engineers' Day for railway engineers and technical experts from the vehicle, machinery, construction, and electrical departments in Beiping. 133 people attended, including Ye Nan, Jin Tao, and Gao Luming. Teng Daiyuan, Minister of the Ministry of Railways, Vice Ministers Lü Zhengcao, Wu Jingtian, and Comrades Li Jiebo and Lu Ping attended. Minister Teng delivered a speech first, hoping that everyone would speak freely and offer valuable suggestions for the construction of people's railways. He also put forward three hopes for the future work of engineers: First, dedicate your strength to the people with an honest attitude and a pragmatic spirit; do not hold back, do not be conservative, do not be arrogant, do not exaggerate, and truly become people's engineers and technical experts who serve the people. Second, establish good relations with workers. Understand that without workers, even the best plans cannot be realized. At the same time, you should study social sciences, learn dialectical materialism, historical materialism, and Mao Zedong Thought. Third, with the development of people's railway construction, a large number of engineers are needed. We must cultivate thousands upon thousands of new engineers—engineers of our own workers. He also pointed out that today's Chinese engineers have a very broad scope for their talents, and he hopes that more heroes will emerge. He especially called on everyone to learn from the experience of Soviet railway construction. Engineers and technical experts then spoke enthusiastically. Everyone put forward many valuable opinions, such as the planning of materials needed for future railway construction, how to help workers summarize experience, and the need for engineers to organize systematic learning and exchange experience in the future. Everyone also unanimously expressed their willingness to serve the people under the leadership of the Communist Party and to learn from the Soviet Union. Finally, Mr. Gao Luming said angrily and joyfully: I have been studying freight rates for more than 20 years, from the late Qing Dynasty to before liberation, and it has never been useful; now that the railway belongs to the people, we have formulated our own freight rate policy, which is a very gratifying phenomenon.
    Finally, Vice Minister Lü Zhengcao encouraged everyone: Engineers who have been oppressed by imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucrat-capitalism for a long time are now greatly liberated. The Communist Party has opened up a vast world for engineers. Engineers have learned science and can now serve the people wholeheartedly. In addition, everyone should continue to learn: learn from the masses, learn social sciences, and only by understanding the laws of social development can we come up with good ideas.

　　“六六”工程师节日
    铁道部邀工程师座谈
    滕部长号召把力量献给人民
    【本报讯】铁道部于“六六”工程师节召开了在平的车、机、工、电等部门的铁道工程师、技术专家座谈会。到会者有叶南、金涛、高鹿鸣等一百三十三人。铁道部滕代远部长，吕正操、武竞天副部长及李颉伯、陆平等同志均出席参加。首由滕部长致词，希望大家本知无不言、言无不尽的精神，给建设人民铁道提出宝贵意见。他并对工程师以后工作提出三点希望：一、以老实的态度，实事求是的精神，把力量献给人民；不保留、不保守、不骄傲、不夸大，真正成为为人民服务的人民工程师和技术专家。二、要与工人把关系搞好。要了解不经过工人，再好的计划也实现不了。同时应该学习社会科学，学习唯物辩证法、历史唯物论和毛泽东思想。三、随着人民铁道建设的发展，需要大批的工程师，我们要培养成千成万的新工程师——工人自己的工程师。他并且指出：今天中国的工程师用武之地甚为宽广，希望我们有更多的英雄出现。他特别号召大家学习苏联铁路建设的经验。工程师、技术专家相继热烈发言。大家提出了许多宝贵意见：如将来建设铁路所需材料的筹划问题，如何帮助工人总结经验的问题，工程师今后应组织有系统学习，交流经验问题等。大家并一致表示愿在共产党领导下为人民服务，并且要向苏联学习。末了高鹿鸣先生气愤而又欣喜地说：我研究运价二十几年，从清末到解放以前，一直没有用处；现在铁路成为人民的了，我们才制订了自己的运价政策，这是非常可喜的现象。
    最后，吕正操副部长勉励大家说：长期被帝国主义、封建主义、官僚资本主义所压迫的工程师们，现在是大解放了，共产党为工程师开辟了广大的天地，工程师学习了科学，现在可以全心全意为人民服务了。另外大家要继续学习：要向群众学习，要学习社会科学，只有懂得社会发展的规律才能想出好主意。
