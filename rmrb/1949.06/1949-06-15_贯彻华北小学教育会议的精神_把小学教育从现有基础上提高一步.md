Implement the Spirit of the North China Elementary Education Conference
　　Raise Elementary Education One Step from Its Current Foundation
    The North China Elementary Education Conference has concluded victoriously. This conference was convened after the task of building a new China was proposed. It is the first time in more than a decade that such a large-scale conference dedicated to discussing elementary education has been held, and it has extremely significant implications for the construction of new democratic elementary education! The conference lasted half a month, and after repeated and heated discussions, it formulated the "Provisional Implementation Measures for Elementary Education" and the "Provisional Service Regulations for Elementary School Teachers," which stipulated a roughly unified system and methods; appropriately solved problems such as teachers, textbooks, funding, and leadership; and put forward the goal of gradually achieving universal education; it has made ideological and organizational preparations for the future development and improvement of elementary education.
    For the past twelve years, new democratic elementary education in the North China Liberated Areas has been sustained and developed amidst the brutal struggle against Japanese imperialism and the Kuomintang reactionaries, under conditions of extreme difficulties in human, material, and financial resources. Our education cadres and elementary school teachers, with the attitude of revolutionary soldiers, based on serving the people, closely linking with reality, and combining with production, made some bold innovations to the traditions of old education, created diverse methods, persisted in teaching work, and cultivated tens of thousands of politically conscious young people with preliminary cultural knowledge, playing a huge role in supporting the war and building the liberated areas; they have accumulated experience in the construction of new democratic elementary education; this should be written as a special chapter in the history of Chinese education. Currently, there are more than 51,900 primary and advanced elementary schools in the entire North China region, with more than 3,250,000 students and more than 76,600 elementary school teachers. However, due to the long-term war-torn and decentralized environment in the past, limited by human, material, and financial resources, and failing to transform and improve in a timely manner with the development of the objective situation, elementary education still has many shortcomings, mainly including incomplete and irregular school systems, simple equipment, and insufficient emphasis on cultural education. In addition, the development of work is uneven. About 40% of school-age children in the old areas are still out of school, and more than 50% in the new areas and newly recovered cities. Among them, the enrollment problems of workers and poor urban residents' children especially need to be solved.
    Now, the entire North China region has been liberated, and nationwide victory is just around the corner. North China has broken away from the situation where war dominated everything for more than ten years and has begun to enter a period of peaceful construction. The focus of future work is first economic construction, and second is cultural education. As the basic education of the nation, elementary education is not only a basic link in the construction of cultural education, but also an indispensable and important condition for developing production. It must be recognized that to build a new democratic country and transform a backward agricultural country into an advanced industrial country, it is impossible without universal education, eliminating illiteracy, improving the people's cultural level, and eliminating illiteracy, unsanitary conditions, and unhealthy states. At the same time, the broad masses of workers and peasants who have been liberated economically and politically are increasingly urgently demanding to learn culture, demanding to educate their children with basic knowledge of reading, writing, and arithmetic, and they feel that it is difficult to develop production and manage village affairs without culture. Therefore, we must regard doing a good job in elementary education and universally improving national culture as one of the important tasks at present. In order to achieve this task, first of all, we must clarify that the implementation policy of elementary education should focus on learning culture. That is, to educate children with basic scientific knowledge of reading, writing, arithmetic, society, nature, and hygiene, cultivate their knowledge of life, and lay the foundation for further education. At the same time, pay attention to hygiene and health education to cultivate children's healthy bodies; in addition, it is also necessary to cultivate children's love for the people's country and good habits of loving labor, democracy, and discipline. This basic policy must never be distorted or modified under any circumstances. Secondly, in order to ensure the successful completion of the education plan, it is necessary to establish a certain system, enrich the necessary teaching equipment, and effectively solve the problems of funding and textbooks, so that elementary education moves towards standardization. Of course, the so-called standardization is not to copy the old-style standardization, but to gradually establish new standardization according to the needs of the people's country and possible conditions. The North China region is vast, and the political and economic foundations of the new and old areas, rural and urban areas are different. Everything must proceed from the actual situation and be adapted to local conditions. For example, in rural areas of the old areas, special attention should be paid to strengthening cultural learning and cultivating children's hygiene habits; in newly liberated cities, in addition to cultural learning, special attention should be paid to labor education and cultivating children's habits of loving labor. The direction and goals must be unified, and the methods can be flexibly applied.
    After the problems of policy, school system, curriculum, teaching materials, and funding are solved, elementary school teachers play a decisive role in whether the school is run well or not. Teachers are directly engaged in education, and all plans and requirements must be completed through the activities of teachers. Over the past ten years, elementary school teachers in the North China Liberated Areas, through long-term struggle and training in their work, have emerged a large number of new-type teachers who are workers and peasants, loyal to serving the people, and heroes and models in the education field, who have won the support of the masses. However, due to the long-term war environment, the needs of various aspects of work, frequent transfers, and lack of opportunities for further study, the number of rural elementary school teachers is generally insufficient, their cultural level is not high, and their work enthusiasm is not full. This should arouse the serious attention of party and government leading organs at all levels and be effectively resolved. It is necessary to appropriately improve the living treatment of teachers under possible conditions; care about their political life, so that they have the opportunity to participate in necessary meetings, listen to reports, and read documents; strengthen the leadership of teachers' learning and provide learning materials; respect them in all aspects and improve their social status; do not transfer them easily, cultivate professional spirit, so that they can work with peace of mind and make better achievements. Elementary school teachers themselves must also carry forward the spirit of hard work and loyalty to serving the people in the past, work hard to learn, improve themselves, and constantly improve their work. Teachers in old areas should focus on learning culture and studying teaching methods; teachers in new areas should focus on improving political understanding, changing old views, old methods, and old styles, and establishing new views, new methods, and new styles. In addition, we should systematically mobilize urban intellectuals to go to rural areas to serve as elementary school teachers to solve the difficulty of rural areas lacking teachers, so that they understand that revolutionary work should start from the grassroots, which is not only a glorious task but also a good way to train and transform themselves.
    Leading comrades of party committees and governments at all levels should have a correct understanding of the importance of doing a good job in elementary education and put education work on the agenda. Adjust cadres, enrich educational administrative institutions at all levels, improve departmental regular work, and conscientiously and responsibly solve all problems in the work. Strive to implement the spirit of the North China Elementary Education Conference, raise elementary education one step from its current foundation, and gradually achieve universal education!

### 贯彻华北小学教育会议的精神　把小学教育从现有基础上提高一步

　　贯彻华北小学教育会议的精神
  　把小学教育从现有基础上提高一步
    华北小学教育会议已胜利的闭幕了。这次会议是在提出建设新中国的任务以后召开的，象这样大规模的专门讨论小学教育的会议，十余年来还是第一次，这对新民主主义的小学教育建设有着极其重大的意义！会议历时半月，经过反复热烈的研究讨论，拟定了“小学教育暂行实施办法”及“小学教师暂行服务规程”，规定了大体上统一的制度与办法；适当的解决了师资、课本、经费、领导等问题；提出了逐步实现普及教育的奋斗目标；为今后小学教育发展与提高，作了思想上、组织上的准备。
    十二年来华北解放区新民主主义小学教育，是在与日本帝国主义及国民党反动派的残酷斗争中，在人力物力财力极端困难的条件下，坚持与发展起来的。我们的教育干部和小学教师，以革命战士的姿态，本着为人民服务，紧密联系实际，结合生产，对旧教育的传统作了一些大胆的革新，创造了多种多样的方式方法，坚持了教学工作，培养了成千上万的有政治觉悟有初步文化知能的青年，对支援战争建设解放区起了巨大的作用；对新民主主义小学教育建设积累了经验；这在中国教育史上，应该写它特殊的一章。现华北全区已有初高级小学五万一千九百余处，学生三百二十五万余人，小学教师七万六千六百余人。但由于过去长期处于战争分散的环境，限于人力物力财力，以及未能随着客观形势的发展而及时转变与提高，小学教育尚有许多缺点，主要是学校制度不完备，不正规，设备简陋，对文化教育重视不够等。加以工作发展不平衡，失学儿童在老区还有百分之四十左右，在新区及新收复城市则在百分之五十以上，其中工人及贫苦市民子女的入学问题，尤需设法解决。
    现在华北区已全部解放，全国胜利指日可期。华北已摆脱了十多年来战争支配一切的局面，开始进入和平建设的时期。今后的工作中心，第一是经济建设，第二便是文化教育。而作为国民基础教育的小学教育，不仅是文化教育建设的基本环节之一，也是发展生产不可缺少的重要条件之一。必须认识：要建设新民主主义的国家，将落后的农业国变为先进的工业国，不普及教育、扫除文盲、提高人民文化水平，消灭不识字、不卫生、不健康的状态，是不行的。同时从经济上、政治上获得解放的广大工农群众，日益迫切地要求学习文化，要求以读写算的基本知能教育他们的子女，他们感到生产发家，管理村政没有文化也是困难的。因此我们必须把办好小学教育，普遍提高国民文化，看作当前的重要任务之一。为实现这一任务，首先就必须明确小学教育实施方针，应以学习文化为主。即是以读写算及社会、自然、卫生等基本科学知识，教育儿童，培养其生活知能，并打下升学深造的基础。同时注意卫生健康教育，培养儿童健康身体；此外，还要培养儿童爱护人民国家的思想，及爱好劳动、民主、守纪律的良好习惯。这一基本方针，在任何情况下，决不许有所歪曲与修改。其次，为保证很好的完成教育计划，就必须建立一定制度，充实必需的教学设备，切实解决经费及课本问题，使小学教育走向正规化。自然所谓正规化，并不是照搬旧型正规化的一套，而是按照人民国家的需要与可能的条件，逐步建立新的正规化。华北地区广大，新区与老区，农村与城市的政治经济基础不同，一切必须从实际情况出发，要因时因地制宜。例如，在老区农村，应特别注意加强文化学习，养成儿童卫生习惯；在新解放城市，则除文化学习外，应特别注意劳动教育，养成儿童爱好劳动的习惯。方针目标必须统一，方法则可灵活运用。
    方针学制课程教材以及经费等问题解决之后，小学办好办坏，小学教师起着决定作用。教师是直接进行教育的，一切计划与要求，都要通过教师的活动才能完成。十多年来，华北解放区的小学教师，经过长期斗争和工作中的锻炼，涌现了大批的工农化的忠诚为人民服务的新型教师和教育界的英雄模范，得到了群众的拥戴。但由于长期战争的环境，多方面工作的需要，调动频繁，进修机会缺少，目前农村小学教师，一般说来，是数量不够，文化水平不高，工作情绪不够饱满的。这应引起各级党政领导机关的严重注意并切实予以解决。必须在可能条件下适当改善教师的生活待遇；关心他们的政治生活，使他们有参加必要的会议，听报告看文件的机会；加强教师学习的领导，供给学习读物；从各方面加以尊重，提高其社会地位；不轻易调动，培养专业精神，使能安心工作，做出更好的成绩。小学教师本身，也要发扬过去艰苦奋斗，忠诚为人民服务的精神，努力学习，提高自己，不断的改进自己的工作。老区教师应着重学习文化，研究教学方法；新区教师则着重提高政治认识，改变旧观点、旧方法、旧作风，树立新观点、新方法、新作风。此外，应有计划地动员城市知识分子到农村去任小学教师，以解决农村缺乏师资的困难，使他们了解，做革命工作应从下层工作做起，这不仅是个光荣的任务，也是锻炼改造自己很好的道路。
    各级党委和政府的领导同志，对办好小学教育的重要性，应有正确的认识，把教育工作提到议事日程上来。调整干部，充实各级教育行政机构，健全部门经常工作，认真负责的解决工作中的一切问题。为贯彻华北小学教育会议的精神，把小学教育从现有基础上提高一步，逐步实现普及教育而奋斗！
