Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, June 24th: TASS Rome dispatch: The Italian merchant marine strike, which began in Genoa on the 20th, has now spread to Savona and then to Naples. In these three ports, ships flying the Italian flag are paralyzed. Three merchant ships were unable to leave the above ports for scheduled voyages to the United States. The Italian Seamen's Union demands pensions for elderly sailors and temporary work for at least some of the unemployed sailors. Shipowners refused to meet these demands and began to suppress the strikers. The owners of the ship "Saturnia" fired all the sailors on the ship, but because the owners could not find strike-breakers to replace them, the ship has not yet been able to leave the port.

    意海员罢工
    三大港口船只瘫痪
    【新华社北平二十四日电】塔斯社罗马讯：意大利商船罢工于二十日自热那亚开始，现已扩至萨窝那，随后又扩至那不勒斯。在这三个港口中悬挂意大利旗的航船均已瘫痪。三艘商船不能离开上述诸港作到美国的定期航行。意大利海员联合会要求给年老海员以养老金，并至少给一部分失业海员以暂时的工作。船主们拒绝满足这些要求并开始镇压罢工者。海船“萨图尼亚”号的船主解雇了该船全体水手，但是因为船主无法找到罢工破坏者来代替，该船至今仍未能开出港口。
