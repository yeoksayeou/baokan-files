Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 16th: The Russian-language "New Life" newspaper here reports: Soong Tzu-wen is using the money squeezed from the Chinese people and the so-called "aid to China" funds obtained by the Truman government from American taxpayers to operate "escape nests" for the Four Families on the border between France and Spain. Near Nice and Biarritz in France, one hundred villas have been purchased or leased long-term for the use of Soong Tzu-wen, Kung Hsiang-hsi, and others. At the same time, large houses have also been purchased in Nice for Wu Kuo-chen and others. Because they fear that drastic political and social changes may occur in France in the future, endangering their safety, Soong is also dealing with Franco, sending special personnel to purchase and lease twenty-five villas near Barcelona, Spain. Soong is now traveling from Paris to New York to discuss with Soong Mei-ling, Kung Hsiang-hsi, and others where to invest the billions of dollars in gold and silver squeezed from the Chinese people. One account says they are preparing to buy shares in South African diamond companies; another says that Soong and Kung will invest huge sums in South American industries. The billions of dollars are currently deposited in American banks. Soong and others have dealt with Mexico and are now going to negotiate with poor and undeveloped South American countries such as Chile, Peru, and Brazil regarding this matter. In other news, two people are actively working for the Four Families: one is the Chinese Catholic Bishop Yu Pin, and the other is Ku Wei-chun, the Kuomintang ambassador. Yu Pin has been ordered by Soong Tzu-wen and Soong Mei-ling to go to South America for activities.

　　在法国西班牙等地
  　四大家族经营逃窟
    【新华社上海十六日电】此间俄文新生活报称：宋子文正运用从中国人民榨取来的金钱和杜鲁门政府从美国纳税人取得的所谓援华资金，在法国与西班牙的边界为四大家族经营逃窟。在法国的尼兹、贝给剌斯等地附近已购买或长期租定别墅一百所，以备宋子文和孔祥熙等自用。同时又为吴国桢等在尼兹购买了大所房屋。因为惧怕法国将来可能发生激烈的政治社会变化而危及他们的安全，宋又与佛朗哥打交道，派遣专人到西班牙的巴塞罗那附近购进和租定别墅二十五所。宋现正由巴黎前往纽约，在该地与宋美龄、孔祥熙等商量将从中国人民所榨取的亿兆金银向何处投资。一说他们准备购买南非洲金钢石公司的股票；一说宋、孔将以巨款向南美的实业方面投资。达亿兆的款项现都存在美国的银行里。宋等曾和墨西哥打过交道，现又去和智利、秘鲁、巴西等贫穷而未开发的南美国家交涉此事。另息，现正积极为四大家庭奔走的有两个人，一个是中国天主教的主教于斌。另外一个是国民党大使顾维钧。于斌已奉了宋子文、宋美龄之命，动身赴南美活动。
