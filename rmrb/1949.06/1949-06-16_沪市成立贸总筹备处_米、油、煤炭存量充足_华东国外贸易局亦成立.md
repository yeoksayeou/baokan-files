　　Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 15th: The Shanghai Military Control Commission and the People's Government, in order to develop foreign trade and exchange urban and rural materials, established the Shanghai Trade Corporation Preparatory Office and the East China Foreign Trade Bureau on the 9th and 13th respectively. The Foreign Trade Bureau has a Foreign Trade Corporation under its administration, whose task is to encourage exports and manage imports. In addition to directly managing state-owned import and export business, the company will also jointly develop foreign trade with private trading firms. Furthermore, the Trade Office of the Military Control Commission announced the registration application procedures for import and export manufacturers on the 13th, stipulating that the application registration period will be from June 15th to July 31st.
    Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 15th: The Trade Office of the Financial and Economic Takeover Committee of the Shanghai Military Control Commission has successively transported a large number of daily necessities such as rice, oil, and coal from Hankou, Wuhu, Bengbu, Wuxi, Hangzhou, Yangzhou, and other places. At present, the reserves of rice, oil, and coal in Shanghai are very sufficient. From the 1st to the 11th of this month alone, 20 million jin of rice were transported in. It is estimated that another 60 to 80 million jin of rice can be transported in by the end of this month. Together with the 80 to 90 million jin that the Kuomintang bandit gang failed to transport away when they fled, this is enough to meet Shanghai's needs for three months. The oil reserves have also reached 2.62 million jin, of which 500,000 jin are the oil reserves of the China Vegetable Oil Factory, which was operated by the Kuomintang government, and the rest were allocated by the East China Resources Committee and the People's Bank after liberation. At present, a large amount of oil raw materials are being purchased and transported from Hangzhou, Jiaxing, and Suzhou. In addition to the more than 70,000 tons of coal received by the Coal Allocation Office of the East China Resources Committee, 7,500 tons have been transported in since liberation. Coal is currently being purchased and transported from Lianyungang and Qinhuangdao. At present, Shanghai has sufficient coal reserves, and industries can apply for purchase and allocation.
    In addition: The China Salt Industry Company, operated by the Kuomintang government and taken over by the Finance Office of the Financial and Economic Takeover Committee of the Shanghai Military Control Commission, officially resumed business on the 11th of this month. The company's existing edible salt is sufficient to supply Shanghai for three to four months. It is now planned to transport salt from northern Jiangsu and other places to Shanghai in batches to supply other regions at any time.
