    Xiao Mei caught a cold from the rain and had a fever in bed. Xiu Nü'er had gone to the countryside again. In the evening, Da Shui helped Xiao Mei boil medicine.

    Several team members also came to see Xiao Mei. Niu Xiao Shui held two large canisters of biscuits and said with a grin, "Women's Director, this is our way of showing our appreciation. Don't just eat corn buns all the time." He put the two very red and beautiful round canisters next to her pillow. Xiao Mei laughed and said, "Oh! Are these your spoils of victory? How dare we eat this stuff?" Zhao Wu Geng said, "You can't say that. You put in the effort too. This is what we all agreed on." Ma Dan Xiao said, "If you hadn't lured the enemy away, we might not have won this battle, and we wouldn't have gotten the big mortar back!"

    Xiao Mei left a canister for Xiu Nü'er, opened one, and told everyone to eat. Each person took two pieces, a rare treat. Xiao Shui smacked his lips, made a face, and said, "Wow, not bad at all! Sweet! This is an extravagance!" Everyone laughed at his antics. They sat for a while and then left to listen to the news report. Da Shui said, "You go ahead, I'll finish boiling the medicine and come right away." The group left.

    Da Shui saw that there was still half a pot of medicine left in the decoction pot, so he poured it out, filling a small bowl, and brought it to Xiao Mei, saying, "Drink it while it's hot. You'll feel better if you sweat a little." Just then, Zhang Jinlong barged in. Da Shui was startled; he quickly put the bowl he was holding on the edge of the bed and greeted him, "Oh, you're here." Zhang Jinlong responded coldly and put his bedding roll on the bed. Da Shui said, "Rest up. I'm going to listen to the news report." Xiao Mei said, "I troubled you to boil the medicine for so long." Da Shui said, "We're all comrades, it's nothing." And went out.

    Zhang Jinlong lay on the bed with his legs crossed, using his bedding roll as a pillow, and smoked a cigarette. Xiao Mei sat up to drink the medicine and asked, "What did you bring your things back for?" Zhang Jinlong said, "I'm sick! Shouldn't I come back?" Xiao Mei didn't think he looked sick, so she asked, "Did you get permission?" Zhang Jinlong took a few puffs of his cigarette and slowly replied, "I told them." Xiao Mei asked, "How many days of leave did you get?" Zhang Jinlong said lazily, "That's not set! I'll go back when I feel better. Even a toad needs a break after three jumps, so I need to rest for a couple of days!" Xiao Mei saw his attitude and knew that this good-for-nothing guy was probably up to no good again, and she was so angry that she put the bowl on the windowsill and covered herself with the quilt to sleep.

    The next day, Shuang Xi returned from the county and secretly told Xiao Mei that Zhang Jinlong wasn't working hard in the county brigade. He would work if it suited him, but he would make trouble if it didn't. Everything had to be according to his wishes. He also couldn't manage his finances. Yesterday at dinner, the buns were a little cold, and he scolded the cook. The brigade deputy criticized him, and he told Hei Lao Cai, packed up his bedding, and left. Shuang Xi also said, "Lao Cai wants you to try to persuade him. Jinlong is skilled in martial arts and we still need to get him to work. If he really doesn't want to go back to the county brigade, he can stay with you for now, and do armed work in the district." Xiao Mei thought for a long time, frowned, and said, "Oh, there's really no way to deal with this guy!" Shuang Xi encouraged her, laughing, "It's a good ointment if it can draw out the pus." Xiao Mei said, "It's like putting ointment on dog skin, I'm afraid it won't stick! I'll try to talk to him."

    Xiao Mei persuaded him for several days, sometimes gently, sometimes firmly, using all sorts of arguments, and finally managed to convince Jinlong again. In the end, he agreed, "Okay! I'll do it for your sake and work here!" So he became a squad leader in the district militia.

    　　Two
    Zhang Jinlong looked down on Niu Da Shui and often acted on his own. Once, Da Shui said to him, "The higher-ups have decided to take the watchtower in Xieliu Village. Let's discuss how to take it." Zhang Jinlong said, "No need to discuss, just leave it to me." Da Shui was worried and said, "Let's go together, there's strength in numbers." Zhang Jinlong said angrily, "Then you go, I'm not needed anyway!" Niu Da Shui saw that he was being difficult and couldn't get along with him, and he was very annoyed. He pouted and went to discuss it with the other cadres in the militia.

    Zhang Jinlong lay down and thought for a while. As soon as it got dark, he changed into a silk padded jacket and trousers, put a top hat askew on one eyebrow, tucked in his gun, and led his squad, rowing a small boat from the lake and around to Xieliu Village.

    Once ashore, he told the small boat to wait for him in the reeds, and he went into the village alone. He went to a restaurant, chose a private room to sit down, first ordered wine and dishes, and then said to the waiter, "Prepare the dishes and bring them in a little while. First go to the watchtower and call my sworn brother, Li Liu Zi, and tell him someone is waiting for him here. Be sure to invite him here, and I'll give you extra money!" The waiter agreed obsequiously and left.

    Not long after, Li Liu Zi arrived. He was very surprised to see Zhang Jinlong, and said with a smile, "Oh, Brother, I wondered who it was, it's you!" Jinlong offered him a seat, and said with a smile, "We haven't seen each other for a long time, let's have a few drinks to celebrate." The waiter brought the wine and dishes and left. Li Liu Zi leaned over and asked quietly, "Brother, I heard...you're doing things on that side?" He used two fingers to make the shape of the number eight. Zhang Jinlong said with a smile, "No such thing! I'm doing business. How are you doing these days?"

    Li Liu Zi said, "Oh, don't mention it! You know what San Ma Zi is like, right? He's ruthless and greedy. Whatever he gets, he keeps it all to himself! Damn it, his brothers don't even get a hair! The other day, he made a fortune, framing a merchant for secretly communicating with the Eighth Route Army and confiscated dozens of bolts of silk, but they all disappeared. He thinks we don't know. Humph!"

    Zhang Jinlong sneered and said, "San Ma Zi is a bastard, nobody's got it good under him!" Li Liu Zi said, "The other day, I managed to find a bicycle with an expired license, and I was told to impound it. Then San Ma Zi saw it and said, "Let me ride it and see if it's good." Damn it, he rode it away and never gave it back! It was a Raleigh, wow, brand new!" The more he talked, the angrier he became, and he knocked over the wine cup while drinking.

    Zhang Jinlong's eyes darted around, his right eyebrow lifted, and he said, "Brother, I'll help you vent this anger. We'll take everything from him, and I'll return the bicycle to you. How about it?" Li Liu Zi's face lit up and said, "That would be great. Brother, what's your plan?" Zhang Jinlong said quietly, "Brother, to be honest, I'm a captain on that side. As long as we get rid of San Ma Zi, you and I will both be heroes, and everything will be fine! We're sworn brothers, what's mine is yours, I'll never treat you wrong!"

    Li Liu Zi's eyes widened at first. As he listened, he became more and more excited, spitting as he said, "Damn it, that's exactly what I want! Brother, I love 'sharing'! Tell me how to do it." Zhang Jinlong shook his chopsticks at him. Li Liu Zi looked back and saw the waiter coming in, putting two bowls of noodle soup on the table.

    After the waiter left, they ate and whispered to each other for a long time. They were both rogues, and they quickly agreed on a plan. They finished discussing, walked out of the restaurant, and parted ways.

    Xiao Xiao Zi had recently become a puppet soldier and was stationed in this watchtower. In the second half of the night, when the moon was about to set, it was Li Liu Zi's turn to stand guard; he and Xiao Xiao Zi were on the fourth floor of the watchtower and signaled to the other side of the ditch with three matches. Three flashes lit up on the other side. They quietly came down and lowered the drawbridge. Zhang Jinlong led his squad in. The puppet soldiers were asleep on the second floor. The light was still on. They went up and quietly confiscated all the guns. Li Liu Zi quickly led Zhang Jinlong to the third floor to get Guo San Ma Zi.

    It was very dark upstairs. A sliver of moonlight shone in through the window, and they vaguely saw Guo San Ma Zi sleeping in his quilt. Zhang Jinlong remembered the past grudges, gritted his teeth, and fired three shots at his head. But he discovered that the bed was made to look like he was in the bed. San Ma Zi's pair of leather shoes was neatly placed in front of the bed. They searched and found two bolts of silk under the mattress. When people weren't looking, the two of them each grabbed a bolt and hurriedly wrapped it around their waists.

    Xiao Xiao Zi ran up to report, "I just heard that San Ma Zi sneaked out, I don't know where he went." Zhang Jinlong said hatefully, "Damn it, he got away easy!" He sent Xiao Xiao Zi to the village to get two civilian boats, while he and Li Liu Zi searched again, putting all of Guo San Ma Zi's valuables into their private pockets.

    That night, Guo San Ma Zi was smoking opium at a good friend's house when he heard three gunshots from the watchtower, which frightened him. He quickly sent someone to secretly inquire, and learned that the Eighth Route Army had taken the tower, so he fled to town that night.

    Just as it was getting light, Zhang Jinlong used two civilian boats to carry more than a dozen prisoners, a bicycle, and various spoils of war. He, Li Liu Zi, Xiao Xiao Zi and others sat in a small boat, returning happily. Halfway there, three fishing boats came towards them. The fisherman in the lead, holding a net, saw Zhang Jinlong and shouted, "Lao Zhang, where are you going? We've been looking for you!" Zhang Jinlong saw that it was Niu Da Shui, and said triumphantly, "I took down the watchtower! Look, the two boats behind are full of prisoners. What are you going to do? Catch fish?"

    The boats on both sides came together, and Da Shui jumped onto their boat, happily saying, "Ha, we were still planning to scout it out, preparing to take the tower tonight. You guys got there first. Lao Zhang, you're really something! How did you do it?" Zhang Jinlong bragged for a while, and then pointed to Li Liu Zi and Xiao Xiao Zi, saying, "They helped out this time too." Da Shui realized that they weren't prisoners and said happily, "Good, good, good, it's much more honorable to come here!" He quickly took out his small pipe to offer them a smoke. Li Liu Zi said, "I have cigarettes." He gave Da Shui one. Xiao Xiao Zi also smoked a cigarette and said to Da Shui with a smile, "We're all the same now!" Da Shui laughed happily.

    The two civilian boats caught up. The three small fishing boats went over to look at the prisoners. Da Shui asked Jinlong, "Was the watchtower burned down?" Jinlong said, "We didn't have time to burn it! Anyway...all the people are out, it doesn't matter whether it's burned or not." Da Shui said, "It's better to burn it down. I'm afraid the enemy will go back and it will be troublesome again. You guys worked hard all night, go back and rest. We'll go burn it." He returned to the fishing boat happily, busy burning the tower.

    The boat on this side also started moving. Li Liu Zi quietly asked Zhang Jinlong, "What kind of role does Niu Da Shui play now?" Zhang Jinlong snorted and said quietly, "He's nominally a captain, but he can't control us!"

    　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　——成语
     　　　　一
    小梅淋了雨，受了点风寒，躺在炕上直发烧。秀女儿又下乡了。晚上，大水帮小梅煎药。
    几个队员也来看小梅。牛小水手里捧着两大筒饼干，笑嘻嘻的说：“妇女主任，这是我们慰劳你的，别吃棒子窝窝啦。”就把两个红得很好看的圆筒儿，放在她枕头边。小梅笑着说：“哈呀！这是你们的胜利品么，我们敢吃这玩艺儿？”赵五更说：“话可不能那么说，你们也出了力啦。这是我们大伙儿公议的。”马胆小说：“吓，要不是你们把敌人勾了去，我们许还打不了这个胜仗呢，大抬杆也他妈的回不来啦。”
    小梅给秀女儿留了一筒，打开一筒，叫大家吃。每人拿了两块，吃个稀罕。小水砸着嘴，作个鬼脸儿说：“哈，真不赖！甜咝咝的呢，这可是开洋晕啦。”逗得大家都笑了。他们坐了一会儿，就要回去听念报。大水说：“你们头前走一步，我马上煎好药就来。”一伙人走了。
    大水看药吊子里熬剩半罐儿了，就逼出来，满满一小碗，端到小梅跟前说：“趁热喝了吧，出点儿汗就好了。”刚好张金龙闯进来。大水猛不乍的吓了一跳；忙把手里的碗放在炕沿上，招呼说：“哦，你来啦。”张金龙冷淡的应了一声，把夹着的铺盖卷儿放在炕上。大水说：“你歇着吧。我听报去呀。”小梅说：“叫你煎了半天药，太麻烦你啦。”大水说：“都是同志，没有什么。”就出去了。
    张金龙翘腿搁脚的躺在炕上，枕着个铺盖卷儿，抽着纸烟。小梅坐起来吃药，问他说：“你带了东西回来作什么？”张金龙说：“病犯了！还不回来？”小梅看他不象有病的样子，就问：“你请了假没有？”张金龙抽了几口烟，慢慢儿回答：“说给他们了。”小梅问：“你请了几天假？”张金龙吊儿浪荡的说：“那不准！多会儿我身体好了再说。蛤蚂蹦三蹦，还得歇三歇呢，我总得逍停两天！”小梅看那劲头儿，这不争气的家伙，准是又捣蘑茹呢，气得她随手把碗儿放在窗台上，蒙着被子就睡了。
    第二天，双喜从县上回来，暗里告诉小梅，张金龙在县大队不好好工作，顺着他的劲儿，他就干，不对他的心眼儿，他就闹情绪，什么都得依着他；生活上又过不来；昨天吃饭，饽饽凉点儿，他把伙夫同志骂了一顿，大队附批评他几句，他跟黑老蔡说了一声，卷起铺盖就走了。双喜又说：“老蔡叫你好好儿劝劝他，金龙这个人武艺上有两手，还得争取他工作。要是他实在不愿意回县大队，暂且和你在一块儿，就在区上搞武装工作也行。”小梅想了半天，皱着眉头说：“唉，这个人，真拿他没办法！”双喜给她鼓劲儿，笑着说：“能拔出脓来，才是好膏药呢。”小梅说：“狗皮上贴膏药，怕不粘哩！我说说试试看吧。”
    小梅一连劝了好几天，一阵软，一阵硬，好说歹说，总算把金龙又说转了。最后他答应：“好！我就瞧着你的面子，在这儿干吧！”他就在区小队当了个班长。
    　　二
    张金龙瞧不起牛大水，常常自由行动。有一次，大水跟他说：“上级决定，叫我们拿斜柳村的岗楼，咱们商量怎么个拿法吧。”张金龙说：“不用商量，这事儿交给我就得了。”大水不放心，说：“还是咱们一块儿去吧，人多力量大。”张金龙气囊囊的说：“那你们去吧，反正也不短我一个人！”牛大水看他蹩蹩扭扭的，老跟他弄不成堆，心里很气恼，噘着嘴儿，找小队上别的干部研究去了。
    张金龙躺着想了一会儿。天一撒黑，他换了一身绸子的夹袄裤，拿一顶礼帽歪歪的压在一边眉毛上，掖好枪，带着他那一班人，划了个小船儿，从淀里出发，绕到斜柳村。
    傍了岸，他叫小船就在苇塘里等他，他独个儿进了村；走到一家饭馆，拣个单间儿坐下来，先叫了酒菜，又对伙计说：“菜你预备好了，停会儿端。你先到岗楼上，把我的把兄弟叫李六子的叫来，说有人在这儿等他。务必把他请来，多给你酒钱！”伙计奉承的应着去了。
    不多一会儿，李六子来了。他一见张金龙，很是意外，笑着说：“哈呀，大哥，我当是谁呢，原来是你！”金龙让了坐，也笑着说：“咱们哥儿俩多时不见，喝两杯痛快痛快。”伙计端上酒菜，下去了。李六子伸过头来，悄悄问：“大哥，听说……你在那方面干事儿？”他用两个手指比了个八字。张金龙笑着说：“没那事儿！我在倒腾买卖呢。你这会儿混得怎么样？”
    李六子说：“唉，别提了！三麻子那个人你还不知道？手又黑，心又狠，捞到什么，都是被窝里放屁：独吞！他妈的，当弟兄的连根毛儿也落不上！前儿个，他发了一笔大财，克了一个买卖人，说他私通八路，弄了几十匹绸缎，都不见了。他盘算我们都还不知道呢。哼！”
    张金龙冷笑说：“三麻子这王八蛋操的，谁在他手底下也没个好！”李六子说：“那天我好容易查出一辆自行车，车照过期了，叫我扣下来啦。谁想三麻子瞧见了，说：“我骑骑看好不好”；妈的，一骑就不给我了！是蓝钢牌的呢，吓，倍儿新！”他越说越气，毛手毛脚的喝酒，把酒杯儿都打翻了。
    张金龙眼珠子一转，右眉毛一扬，说：“兄弟，我给你出这口气。什么东西都把它掏出来，车子还交给你手里，你看好不好？”李六子笑开了脸儿，说：“那敢情好嘛。大哥，你有什么好主意？”张金龙小声说：“兄弟，老实告诉你，我在那边当队长呢。咱们只要把三麻子拾掇了，你我都是有功之臣，什么还不好说呀？咱俩并肩齐膀的好兄弟，有我的就有你的，决错待不了你！”
    李六子乍一听，睁大了眼儿；听听，他劲头儿就上来了，唾沫乱溅的说：“我操他姥姥，这可对了我心眼儿啦。大哥，我这个人就爱‘共点’！你说怎么个弄法吧。”张金龙拿筷子对他摇摇，李六子一回头，瞧见伙计进来了，把两碗挂面汤放在桌上。
    伙计走了以后，他俩一面吃，一面凑在一块儿，嘁嘁喳喳的说了半天。他两个本是一流子，一说就合辙，商量妥当，走出饭馆，就分手了。
    小小子最近也当了伪军，就在这岗楼上。下半夜，月亮快下去了，轮到李六子站岗；他和小小子在岗楼第四层上，对下面连划三根洋火。沟那边也亮了三下。他两个悄悄下来，放下吊桥。张金龙带着一班人就突进去。伪军在二层楼上，都睡熟了。灯儿还点着。他们上去，轻手轻脚的把枪全＠了。李六子忙带着张金龙到三层楼上，去打郭三麻子。
    上面很黑，窗窟窿口斜斜的照进来一溜月亮，影影糊糊看见郭三麻子睡在被窝里。张金龙想起过去的仇恨，咬着牙，对着他的头，一连打了三枪。可是发现床上是被窝做的假样儿，三麻子穿的一双皮鞋还端端正正的放在床跟前。他们一搜，发现褥子底下，铺着两匹绸子，他两个趁人们不在，一个拿了一匹，急忙忙缠在腰里了。
    小小子跑上来报告：“我刚才听说，三麻子悄悄溜出去了，不定到哪儿逛荡去啦。”张金龙恨恨的说：“妈的，便宜这小子！”他打发小小子去村里弄两只民船，自己和李六子又搜刮一遍，把郭三麻子存的好东西，都入了他俩私人的腰包。
    这天夜里，郭三麻子正在一个相好的财主家抽大烟，听到岗楼上三声枪响，吓得他心惊肉跳，忙打发人暗里探听，知道八路军拿了楼，他就连夜逃到市镇去了。
    天刚亮，张金龙用两只民船，载着十几个俘虏，一辆自行车，和七七八八的胜利品；他跟李六子小小子几个坐着小船，兴头头的回来。走在半路，迎面来了三只渔船，头前一个打渔的，拿着个旋网，瞧见张金龙就喊：“老张，你们到哪儿去？叫我们好找啊！”张金龙一看是牛大水，就得意洋洋的说：“我把岗楼拿下来了！你看，后面那两只船上尽押的俘虏。你们去干什么？治鱼去啊？”
    两边船靠拢了，大水跳到这边船上，高兴的说：“哈，我们还想去探一探，准备今晚上拿楼呢。你们可先得手啦。老张啊，你真有两手！你们怎么弄的？”张金龙吹了一通，又指着李六子小小子说：“这回他俩也出了力啦。”大水才知道他俩不是俘虏，快活的说：“好好好，到这边来可光荣多啦！”忙掏出小烟袋来请他俩抽。李六子说：“我这有烟卷儿。”给了大水一支。小小子也抽着烟卷儿，笑着对大水说：“咱们都一势啦！”大水喜得直笑。
    两只民船跟上来了。三只小渔船就凑过去看俘虏。大水问金龙：“那边岗楼烧了没有？”金龙说：“我们还顾得上烧！反正……人都拉出来了，烧不烧也没有什么关系。”大水说：“还是烧了的好。恐怕敌人再去，又麻烦啦。你们辛苦了一夜，快回去歇歇吧。我们去烧。”他兴高彩烈的回到渔船上，忙着烧楼去了。
    这边也开了船。李六子悄悄问张金龙：“牛大水这会儿当个什么角儿？”张金龙鼻子里哼了一下，小声说：“他啊，应名儿是个队长，他可管不了咱们！”
