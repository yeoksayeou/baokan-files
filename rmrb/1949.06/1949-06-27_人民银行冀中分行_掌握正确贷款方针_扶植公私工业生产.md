　　Grasps Correct Lending Policy to Support Public and Private Industrial Production

　　[Jizhong News] Since the People's Bank of Jizhong Branch held a meeting of its offices and key sub-branches at the end of April, the lending freeze order has been completely lifted. In May, lending basically adhered to the principle of prioritizing public over private and industry over commerce. According to statistics from fourteen branches, out of 99 borrowers, industrial enterprises accounted for 65. The total amount lent was 91,782,600 yuan, with public enterprises accounting for 84.5% of the total, cooperatives accounting for 3.6%, and private enterprises accounting for 11.9%. Jizhong Industrial Company, Baoding Iron Factory, Hejian Qunli Knitting Factory, Botou Yonghua Match Factory and other civilian industries have also expanded reproduction with the support of the bank. Lending to private industries focused on the manufacture of waterwheels and agricultural implements, as well as the oil pressing industry.

　　人民银行冀中分行
  　掌握正确贷款方针　扶植公私工业生产
    【冀中讯】中国人民银行冀中分行，自四月底召开各办事处及重点支行会议后，放款冻结令即告全面结束，五月份放款基本上掌握了先公后私、先工后商的原则。按十四个行处统计，放出九十九户中，工业户即占六十五户。总放出数为九千一百七十八万二千六百元，公营占全数的百分之八十四点五，合作社占百分之三点六，私营占百分之十一点九。冀中实业公司、保定铁工厂、河间群利针织厂，泊头永华火柴厂等民用工业，也都在银行的扶植下扩大了再生产。私人工业放款则着重了水车及农具的制造和榨油业。
