More than 100 people attended, including station masters and trade union representatives from 28 stations under its jurisdiction. First, Gu Hongwen, head of the Beiping Car Department, explained that the significance of implementing the new traffic system is to increase production and reduce transportation costs. The main content of the new traffic system is to formulate annual transportation plans every year, monthly systems every month, rationally use vehicles, avoid roundabout transportation, save transportation capacity, improve traffic management, improve technology and travel speed, eliminate all accidents, ensure traffic safety, and save many unnecessary procedures to enhance loading and unloading capacity. It was decided that mid-June is the preparation period for the implementation of the new traffic system, late June is the trial period, and efforts will be made to implement it universally starting on July 1st.

Then, six groups were divided to discuss the draft of the new traffic system. Each group put forward many opinions on scheduling and transportation, load, personnel, etc., and reviewed the unnecessary accidents that occurred in the past due to the lack of a joint labor system. It was unanimously believed that the new traffic system can give play to everyone's creativity and close mutual cooperation. Finally, the meeting summary pointed out that in the future, it is necessary to: (1) Conduct detailed investigation and research to make specific transportation plans. (2) Implement the responsibility system from top to bottom and from bottom to top, and mobilize and organize the masses to consciously implement it. (3) The loading and unloading system is now being uniformly resolved by the Ministry of Railways. (4) Establish a reward and punishment system, and each section should organize a reward and punishment committee. It is also hoped that everyone will pay close attention to organizing the station, strengthening various necessary equipment, implementing a detailed responsibility system, organizing station order, and establishing the spirit of serving the people as the standard for rewards and punishments.
