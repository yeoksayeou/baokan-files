　　New Learning Methods I Have Experienced
　　——Self-Study, Mutual Assistance, and Tutoring
　　Huada Yu Piao

　　I am a graduate of Huada (Hua University). When I was studying at Huada, I personally experienced a new learning method—self-study, mutual assistance, and tutoring. It fully promoted the spirit of free thinking, bold questioning, seeking truth from facts, and pursuing truth. Therefore, it was very effective in learning. Students felt that they could solve problems and consciously study in depth. It is much better than the kind of learning method I went through in the schools of the old society—pure lecturing. When I was studying in the old schools, I felt very dry and uninteresting, because I was only listening to the teachers talking all day long. The teachers knew something, and they told the students. It was like a knowledge peddling. Students advocated reading dead books, you do your thing, I do my thing, "well water does not interfere with river water." As a result, the effect of learning was half the effort. Because, first, it is not based on conscious and active learning; it is difficult to open your mind and think deeply. Second, the injection-style learning is not suitable for the requirements of the students, so everyone has no interest in listening to lectures. Third, the teachers have already analyzed and explained the problem, reducing the opportunity for students to discover and synthesize problems. The methods of self-consciousness, mutual assistance, and guidance not only do not have the above shortcomings, but also have many advantages: First, it is a collective learning method, which can promote the spirit of mutual assistance and fraternity, and remedy the difference in cultural level between each other, and truly concentrate everyone's wisdom to seek further progress in learning. Second, it improves students' sense of responsibility for learning, actively delve into it, and consciously think deeply. During the learning process, students can give play to their creativity in learning. Third, teachers and students are truly integrated in learning, and what teachers talk about is what students urgently need to know.

　　First, let me introduce our learning content, which includes dialectical materialism and historical materialism, New Democracy, modern Chinese revolutionary history, basic policies of New Democracy, current affairs, and an introduction to the Chinese Communist Party and the Chinese New Democratic Youth League.

　　Next, let's talk about the learning methods of self-study, mutual assistance, and tutoring.

　　Each course is tutored by a fixed teacher. The teacher, in light of the students' situation, stipulates the learning materials. First, he makes an introduction, clarifies the purpose of learning this course, the focus of learning, and stipulates the progress of learning. Then, the students are organized separately, and each group is divided into several mutual assistance groups to read reference materials and organize free talk meetings and discussion meetings.

　　Mutual aid groups are established on a voluntary basis. Those who are willing to be together in a living group (eight to nine people) are divided together. However, each mutual aid group (three or four people is the most suitable) has people with higher and lower cultural levels. The principle of voluntariness can avoid the estrangement between people, and problems can be discussed boldly and deeply. The mutual matching of different cultural levels can promote mutual assistance. If there are too many people in the mutual aid group, it is not easy to concentrate attention, and the opportunity for each person to speak and read is also easily restricted. If there are too few people, it is difficult to achieve the effect of mutual aid.

　　After the mutual aid group is formed, it carries out reading in the mutual aid group. Three or four people with books and notebooks, some in the dormitory, some under the shade of trees... start learning. First, the mutual aid group leader explains the reading progress and focus, and then a student reads. After reading a paragraph, explain according to the original text. Each student pays attention to listening to and understanding the meaning of the article, and raises questions at any time. If the questions raised are simple questions such as words and terms, students who understand can explain them on the spot, or everyone can talk about them, and they will be resolved. If they cannot be resolved, they will be recorded and prepared for free talk at the free talk meeting. If no questions can be raised, students with higher cultural levels should consider the situation and raise some key questions for discussion. After reading, explaining, raising questions, and talking for a while, the reading student summarizes the main idea of ​​this paragraph and puts forward the key points, and then makes notes according to the summary. If the notes are well done, everyone can study and learn. If the notes are poor, they can make suggestions for correction. After following this procedure for a period of time, it is the turn of another student. If there are reference materials, they should also be read in conjunction.

　　Reading, explaining, raising questions, talking, summarizing, taking notes,... this is a "close reading" method. If it is a secondary reference material, "skim reading" is adopted, and only two processes of reading and summarizing are required.

　　The mutual aid group is conducting itself in this informal way, pleasantly and easily; but very seriously and earnestly. Everyone feels that the mutual aid group is of great help to learning; students with lower cultural levels, because someone helps them "move stones" (obstacles in words), have overcome a major difficulty in learning; students with higher cultural levels, because they help others learn, if they cannot accurately understand what they have learned, it will not be easy to explain it to others. Therefore, they will work harder to study. After reading the document in this way, and raising questions, we enter the second stage of self-study—group free talk meeting.

　　Two or three mutual aid groups put forward their questions and start free talk. The chairman controls the meeting. Some questions can be resolved during the free talk, and unresolved questions are left for discussion meetings. The free talk meeting should proceed from reality and not split hairs. If you can relate to reality and yourself more, you can talk well and enthusiastically. Encourage students who don't like to speak to speak. After everyone expresses their views and thoughts, everyone will study them together. For various incorrect understandings, we must meticulously explore the root causes of the errors and guide everyone to understand the correct thoughts.

　　If the questions are raised appropriately and are controversial, everyone will be enthusiastic, but there is no need to argue excessively. The free talk meeting does not necessarily solve all the questions, and there is not enough time; unresolved questions can be brought up at the discussion meeting. If no more questions can be raised, or no questions can be raised, the group leader will go to other groups to collect them, and bring the good topics to their own group for discussion.

　　After reading a certain course in this way, the group can organize the questions that have been talked about and hand over some questions that need to be discussed to the study group.

　　The study group collects the questions and organizes them. The questions are divided into two categories: one is of a review and narrative nature, and the other is of a controversial nature. After organizing the topics, they are sent to the groups, and each student actively prepares a speech outline for the discussion meeting, and finds reference materials to prepare for speaking at the discussion meeting.

　　The discussion meeting can be jointly organized by two or three groups, about thirty or forty people is best. The chairman is temporarily selected. The chairman should pay good attention to the differences in speeches, especially for vague views, they should be raised in a timely manner and discussed. If the chairman cannot control the meeting alone, he can ask someone to assist him to pay attention to certain problems during the discussion. For example, regarding "What is the position of intellectuals in the revolution?" One student said "occupying a leading position", and another student said "playing a bridging role". The basic difference between "leading role" and "bridging role" should be pointed out in a timely manner; at the same time, individual imprecise examples should be analyzed appropriately.

　　The chairman should try to give incorrect opinions the opportunity to be expressed, clarify their views, so as to solve the ideological problems they have.

　　After the discussion meeting, the study group organizes the records and hands them over to the teacher, and discusses how to answer them. The teacher should attach great importance to the opinions of the study group, because the study group is much closer to the students and understands the ideological situation in the students' discussions.

　　The teacher's tutoring work is finally to answer questions. Because what the teacher answers is exactly what the students need to know, after speaking, it can solve many problems and clarify many vague views. After answering the questions, a course comes to an end.

　　Introduction, reading, free talk, discussion, answering questions, this is the whole process of the self-study, mutual assistance and tutoring system.

　　This kind of learning method makes students feel very nervous and very interested.

　　我所体验过的新学习方法
    ——自学、互助、和辅导
    华大　余飘
    我是华大毕业的同学，当我在华大学习的时候，切身体验到一种新学习方法——自学、互助、辅导。它充分地发扬了自由思考、大胆怀疑、实事求是、追求真理的精神，所以在学习上收效很大，同学们感到能解决问题，自觉的深入学习。比我在旧社会的学校里所经过的那种学习方法——单纯讲授强的多，在旧学校里学习时我感到十分的干燥无味，因为每天只是听教员讲来讲去，教员知道什么，给同学们讲什么，好象是知识贩卖，同学间提倡读死书，你干你的，我干我的，“井水不犯河水”。结果学习的效果是事倍功半。因为，第一、不是建立在自觉的基础上主动的学习；很难打开脑筋，深入的去思考。第二、注入式的学习，不适合于同学们的要求，所以大家对听课毫无兴趣。第三、教员已经把问题分析了解释了，减少了同学们发现问题综合问题的机会。而自觉、互助、辅导方法不但没有以上缺点，并有很多优点：第一、它是集体主义的一种学习方法，可以发扬互助友爱的精神，补救彼此间文化水平之差别，真正作到集中大家的智慧，求得在学习上深入一步。第二、提高了同学对学习的责任心，主动地去钻研自觉地深入思考，在学习过程中能发挥同学们在学习上的创造性。第三、教员与同学真正在学习上打成一片，教员所讲的都是同学迫切需要知道的。
    首先介绍我们的学习内容，共包括辩证唯物论与历史唯物论、新民主主义论、中国近代革命史、新民主主义基本政策、时事、中国共产党与中国新民主主义青年团介绍。
    其次谈一谈自学、互助、辅导的学习方法。
    各门课程由固定的教员来辅导，教员针对同学的情况，规定学习材料，首先作一次引言，明确本门课程学习的目的，学习的重点，并规定了学习的进度，然后同学们就分别组织起来，各组分成若干互助小组，阅读参考材料，组织漫谈会与讨论会。
    互助小组建立在自愿的基础上，在一个生活小组内（八人—九人）愿在一起的，就分在一起。但每个互助小组内（以三、四人最为合适），里面有文化水平较高的和较低的。自愿的原则，可以避免人与人之间的隔膜，谈问题也可以大胆深入，文化水平高低不同的相互配搭可以发扬互助。互助小组人数过多，注意力不容易集中，并且每个人的发言与阅读的机会也容易受到限制，如果人数过少，就难收互助之效。
    互助小组组成以后，便在互助小组中进行阅读，三、四个人拿着书和笔记本，有的在宿舍里，有的在树荫下……就学习起来，先由互助小组长说明阅读的进度与重点，然后由一个同学读，读一段后，按照原文加以说明，每个同学都注意听与理解文章的意义，随时提出问题来，如果提出的问题是词句、术语等简单的问题，懂得的同学可以当场解释，或大家漫谈一下，就解决了，如果解决不了就记录下来，准备在漫谈会上漫谈，如果提不出问题来，文化水平较高的同学要斟酌情形提出些关键问题来讨论。读、解释、提问题、漫谈一下以后，由读的同学总结本段大意并提出重点，然后分别根据总结作出笔记，做的好的，大家可以研究、学习，做的差的，就提出意见改正。按照这个程序进行一段后，再轮到另一位同学。如果有参改材料也应该配合着读。
    读、解释、提问题、漫谈、总结、作笔记、……这是一种“精读”方法。如果是次要的参考材料，就采取“粗读”，只经过读与总结两个过程就可以了。
    互助小组就这样不拘形式的，在各处进行着，愉快而轻松；但是很严肃、认真。大家都感到互助小组对学习有很大帮助；文化水平低些的同学，因为有人替他“搬石头”（文辞上的障碍），克服了学习中的一个大困难；文化水平高的同学，由于帮助别人学习，自己如不能确切的懂得所学的内容，就不容易给人家解释清楚。所以自己就更加倍的努力学习。这样把文件阅读以后，提出了问题，于是进入自学的第二阶段——小组漫谈会。
    两个或三个互助小组把问题都提了出来，展开漫谈，由主席掌握会场，有些问题就可以在漫谈当中解决了，不能解决的问题留下来，准备开讨论会。漫谈会要从实际出发，不要钻牛角尖。如果能够多联系实际与自己，就漫谈得好，而且热烈。要鼓励不爱发言的同学说话，每个人表现出自己的观点与思想后，大家再来研究，对各种不正确的认识要细腻的探究错误的根源，引导大家领会正确的思想。
    问题如果提的适当，且有争论性，大家就起劲，但不必过分争论，漫谈会不一定把问题都解决，且时间不够；未解决的问题，可以提到讨论会上，如果提不出更多的问题，或提不出问题，小组长就到其他小组去搜集，好的题目拿到自己组里谈。
    这样将某一课程读完以后，可以小组为单位，整理一下漫谈过的问题把一些有讨论的必要的问题交给学习股。
    学习股搜集了问题，加以整理。问题分成两类：一类是温习叙述性质的，一类是有争论性质的。整理出题目以后，发到小组去，每个同学都积极准备讨论会的发言提纲，自己去找参考材料，准备在讨论会上发言。
    讨论会可以由两三个小组联合组成，约三、四十人最好，主席临时选出，主席要很好的注意发言的分歧点，尤其对于观点模糊的问题，要及时提出，展开讨论，主席一人掌握不了会场，可请人协助，分别注意讨论进行中的某些问题。例如关于“知识分子在革命中占什么地位？”一位同学说“占领导地位”，另一位同学说是“起着桥梁作用”。“领导作用”与“桥梁作用”基本的不同就应当及时指出来；同时应当适时的分析个别不十分确切的例证。
    主席要尽量让不正确的意见有发表的机会，弄清他们的观点，以便解决他们思想上所存的问题。
    讨论会结束后，学习股整理记录交给教员，并商量如何进行解答，教员应当十分重视学习股的意见，因为学习股与同学要接近得多，了解同学讨论中的思想情况。
    教员的辅导工作，最后便是解答问题，因为教员解答的正是同学们所需要知道的，所以讲过后，能够解决很多问题，澄清不少模糊观点。解答问题以后，一门功课便告一段落。
    引言、阅读、漫谈、讨论、解答问题，这便是全部自学互助辅导制的一个过程。
    这样的学习方法，使同学感到十分紧张，且兴趣很大。
