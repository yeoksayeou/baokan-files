　　The Bolshoi Theatre, Maly Theatre, and Art Theatre of Moscow
　　(Random Talks on the Soviet Union - 3)

　　In the central district of Moscow, on Sverdlov Square, stands a magnificent building. Its facade features eight marble columns, and atop the main entrance is a statue of Apollo (the Greek mythological god of the arts, also the sun god) driving a chariot. This is the "Soviet State Academic Bolshoi Theatre" (Bolshoi means "Grand"). This theatre has a history of over 120 years, and it has played a significant role in the development of Russian opera and ballet. Originally, it was simply called the "Grand Theatre," but after the October Revolution, in 1917, the Soviet government nationalized it and bestowed upon it the prestigious title "Academic."
　　The Bolshoi Theatre seats 2,000 spectators, and its stage is deep and wide, suitable for staging opulent grand scenes of opera and ballet. The interior of the theatre is extremely luxurious, with gold-embroidered curtains, red velvet cushions, a ceiling painted with the nine Muses of the Arts, and large crystal chandeliers. Anyone who visits Moscow must see a performance at the "Bolshoi Theatre."
　　The best operas and ballets composed by Russian composers are first performed at the "Bolshoi Theatre;" for example, Glinka's "Ivan Susanin," "Ruslan and Lyudmila," Tchaikovsky's "Eugene Onegin," "The Queen of Spades," Borodin's "The Snow Maiden," "The Tale of Tsar Saltan," etc. Foreign operas are also staged.
　　As for Soviet-era operas staged at the theatre, there are "And Quiet Flows the Don" (adapted from Sholokhov's novel), "On the Line of Fire," etc. The theme of "On the Line of Fire" is the 1941 Battle of Moscow.
　　Ballet is an outstanding tradition of the "Bolshoi Theatre." Frequently performed are Tchaikovsky's "Swan Lake," "The Nutcracker," "Sleeping Beauty," etc.; Soviet-era ballets include Prokofiev's "Cinderella," Yurovsky's "The Scarlet Sails," Asafiev's "The Flames of Paris," etc.
　　For many years, the "Bolshoi Theatre" has indeed developed into a true academy of the highest order for vocal and dance arts (hence the government bestowed upon it the epithet Academic). Many famous vocal and dance masters are inseparable from the history of the Bolshoi Theatre, and many talented individuals in vocal and dance have been trained there. Since the late 19th century, its vocal and dance stars have been renowned worldwide. In the Soviet era, thanks to the government's promotion and care, the "Bolshoi Theatre" has been able to greatly develop its specialties and cultivate many new talents. Its "Ballet School" is also one of the oldest such schools in the world, and its graduates replenish the theatre's needs every year. The "Bolshoi Theatre" has its own manufacturing plant dedicated to making scenery, props, costumes, etc. In total, there are over 3,000 experts, staff, and front-of-house personnel.
　　Due to the "Bolshoi Theatre's" achievements and contributions in opera and ballet, the Soviet government awarded it the most prestigious Order of Lenin.
　　The full name of the "Maly Theatre" is the "Soviet State Academic Maly Theatre," Maly meaning "Small." It is dedicated to performing spoken drama and is also located on Sverdlov Square. It is a yellow, low-rise building, originally built by the famous architect Bove for a Moscow merchant named Vargin in the 1820s, just after Napoleon was defeated and Moscow was rebuilt from the rubble. On October 26, 1824, the "Moscow Drama Troupe" rented this building from the merchant, made some minor modifications (as it originally had a small music hall), and opened its doors. Although the "Moscow Drama Troupe" held its first public performance as early as April 11, 1806, the "Maly Theatre's" site did not exist until 1824, but in terms of the troupe's history, it is already over 140 years old.
　　The "Maly Theatre's" performances are characterized by their rich, elevated ideas and profound realistic forms. For a century, the "Maly Theatre" has consistently been a strong bastion of culture and education. The famous actor Mikhail Shchepkin performed at the "Maly Theatre" for decades in the first half of the 19th century; Shchepkin is known as the "founder of Russian realistic acting," and was also a progressive thinker. He was good friends with the great writers of the time, such as Pushkin, Gogol, Belinsky, and Herzen. Shchepkin's era was the era when Russian classical literature, such as Gogol's "The Government Inspector" and Griboyedov's "Woe from Wit," emerged. The "Maly Theatre" gained great fame for its successful performances of these plays and established its outstanding tradition. For nearly a century, the works of major Russian writers have been presented to audiences through the "Maly Theatre." The works of the great playwright Alexander Ostrovsky were performed by the famous Sadovsky (who was a friend of Ostrovsky) and his descendants, enjoying great fame for decades. Ostrovsky's relationship with the "Maly Theatre" is somewhat similar to Chekhov's relationship with the "Art Theatre." To commemorate Ostrovsky's contributions, the Soviet government erected a bronze statue of Ostrovsky in front of the "Maly Theatre." Many of Ostrovsky's works represented the progressive ideas of his time, and the characters in his works represented all levels of Russian society at that time. The Sadovsky family became the pillar of the "Maly Theatre," and the grandson of the elder Sadovsky served as artistic director for decades until his recent death.
　　Just as the "Bolshoi Theatre" has become the highest academy for cultivating vocal and dance talents, the "Maly Theatre" has also achieved the status of the highest academy for cultivating drama talents for a century. In the late 19th century, the "Maly Theatre" was full of talent, and all the great stars came from its ranks. No matter what play was performed, the lineup was so complete that it was unmatched at the time. The "Maly Theatre" has an affiliated "Shchepkin Drama School," and new cadres are trained every year.
　　After the revolution, the "Maly Theatre" was nationalized and bestowed with the title "Academic"; in September 1937, it was also awarded the Order of Lenin.
　　The "Moscow Art Theatre" was founded in 1898 by Stanislavsky and Nemirovich-Danchenko (a playwright named Vladimir), and this year marks its 50th anniversary. The Art Theatre is truly world-renowned, and its influence extends to Europe, the Americas, and even the East.
　　The ideals of the founders of the Art Theatre were, first, to meet the intellectual demands of the progressive intellectuals of the time, and second, to develop their newly created performance methods and complete the reform of stage art. Before each play is rehearsed, the director's task is to conduct a thorough psychological analysis of the script. The director and actors must first strive to discover the motives that govern the actions of the characters in the play. This method is the famous so-called "Stanislavsky System." In Stanislavsky's own words, it is "a method of working that enables the actor to create the character he plays, to discover the activities of the human mind, and to perform them on stage in a beautiful artistic form."
　　The opening play of the Art Theatre was Alexei Konstantinovich Tolstoy's historical tragedy "Tsar Fyodor Ioannovich." This play is still performed from time to time. Next, Chekhov's "The Seagull" was performed. This was a play that other theatres had failed to perform successfully, but the Art Theatre performed it exceptionally well using its new methods; this established the Art Theatre's position and confirmed the value of the "Stanislavsky System." And the seagull became the emblem of the Art Theatre, and the silver-grey seagull is still embroidered on its light blue velvet curtain. Chekhov's deep friendship with the Art Theatre was also established from then on. Chekhov's best works, such as "The Three Sisters" and "The Cherry Orchard," were written specifically for the Art Theatre.
　　No less important to the Art Theatre than Chekhov was Gorky. When Gorky rose to prominence in the literary world in the late 1890s, the Art Theatre encouraged him to write plays. So Gorky wrote "The Petty Bourgeois" and "The Lower Depths." Before the former was staged, the printed version had already been published and was popular throughout Russia, with twelve reprints in one year, totaling 60,000 copies; therefore, when it was first staged on October 25, 1902, the audience rushed to be among the first to see it. The Tsar's police, seeing the great commotion caused by this play and fearing that something might happen, took extremely strict temporary precautions. Unexpectedly, the performance was met with a lukewarm response and ended after only twenty-three performances. The reason was that the performance at that time ignored the play's basic idea—the conflict between the old and new worldviews—and only highlighted the story of the Bessonov family. As for the performance of "The Lower Depths," it was a great success. Both artistically and in terms of social significance, the performance of "The Lower Depths" was not to be ignored.
　　In addition to the works of Chekhov and Gorky, the Art Theatre also performs Russian classical works and Western European classical works, but its greatest aim is to perform works with profound ideological content—works that express a firm belief in lofty ideals and predict the inevitable emergence of a rational and equal society, as Chekhov and Gorky declared in their works. When the Art Theatre celebrated its 35th anniversary, to commemorate Gorky's support for the Art Theatre, the theatre's name was prefixed with Gorky's name, so its full name should be "Moscow Gorky Art Theatre."
　　It goes without saying that the works of Soviet writers are often performed at the Art Theatre. It is worth mentioning that Tolstoy's "Anna Karenina" was adapted and performed in 1937, and it was awarded the Order of Lenin. This was the first time a Soviet theatre had received the Order of Lenin. Later, the Art Theatre also received the Order of the Red Banner of Labour.
　　Since its establishment to the present (first quarter of 1947), the Art Theatre has staged 113 plays, with a total of 18,000 performances, and an audience of approximately 20 million. Gorky's "The Lower Depths" and Chekhov's "The Cherry Orchard" have both been performed over 1,000 times. Alexei Konstantinovich Tolstoy's "Tsar Fyodor Ioannovich" has been performed 800 times. The decoration of the Art Theatre is extremely elegant, and the audience seating is not very large, only about 500 or 600.
　　Stanislavsky (died in 1938) and Vladimir Nemirovich-Danchenko (died in 1943) both devoted their lives to training the younger generation of actors and directors. After the October Revolution, many research classes were attached to the Art Theatre. Later, these research classes developed into independent theatres, such as the "Vakhtangov Theatre," the "Stanislavsky and Nemirovich-Danchenko Musical Theatre," and the "Stanislavsky Opera and Drama Theatre." Currently, the Art Theatre also has an affiliated "Nemirovich-Danchenko Drama School" dedicated to researching and promoting the performing traditions of the Art Theatre.

　　莫斯科的大戏院、小戏院和艺术戏院
  　（杂谈苏联之三）
    茅盾
    莫斯科的中心区斯维特洛夫广场有一座壮丽的大建筑，正面八根大理石圆柱，正门屋顶有阿波罗（希腊神话艺术之神，又为太阳神）驾着车子的雕像，这就是“苏联国立阿卡台米克鲍尔希戏院”（鲍尔希就是“大”的意义）。这戏院已有一百二十多年的历史，它对于俄罗斯歌剧和舞剧的发展起了重大的作用，原名只是“大戏院”，十月革命后，于一九一七年，苏联政府改为国立，而且赐以“阿卡台米克Ａｃａｄｅｍｉｃ”的尊称。
    大戏院有观众座二千，舞台深广，适宜于演出歌剧舞剧的富丽堂皇的大场面。戏院内部装修极尽华丽，织金的幕，红丝绒的坐垫，剧场圆顶绘着九位文艺女神，水晶璎珞的大挂灯。凡到莫斯科的，总得到“大戏院”看一次戏。
    俄罗斯作曲家所作最好的歌剧舞剧都是首先在“大戏院”上演的；例如格林卡的“伊凡·苏萨宁”，“罗斯伦与洛特米拉”，却得伊科夫斯基的“奥涅金”，“铲形皇后”，鲍罗庭的“雪女”，“沙皇萨尔丹的故事”等等。也上演外国歌剧。
    至于苏维埃时代的歌剧在戏院上演的，则有“静静的顿河”（根据萧洛霍夫的小说改编的），“火线下”等等。“火线下”的题材就是一九四一年的莫斯科保卫战。
    舞剧是“大戏院”的优秀传统。常上演的，是却伊科夫斯基作曲的“天鹅湖”，“胡桃夹子”，“睡美人”等等；苏维埃时代的舞剧则有普洛考非也夫的“灰姑娘”，犹罗夫斯基的“绯色的帆”，阿萨非也夫的“巴黎的火焰”等等。
    多年以来，“大戏院”确已发展成为歌舞艺术之真正的最高学府，（所以它得政府锡以阿卡台米克——学院的——美名）。许多歌舞名师和大戏院的历史不可分离，许多歌舞人材从“大戏院”训练出来。十九世纪末叶以来，它的歌舞明星曾扬名于全世界。到了苏维埃时代，由于政府之提倡爱护，“大戏院”更能大大发挥它的特长，而造就了许多新的人材。它的“舞剧学校”也是世界上历史最久的此种学校之一，每年出来的毕业生充实戏院的需要。“大戏院”自有制造厂专制布景道具服装等等。这一方面的专家，工作人员以及前台职员等等，共计有三千人之多。
    由于“大戏院”在歌舞剧方面的成就与贡献，苏联政府曾颁给它最崇贵的列宁勋章。
    “小戏院”的全名是“苏联国立阿卡台米克玛雷戏院”，玛雷就是“小”的意义。这是专演话剧的，也在斯维特洛夫广场。这是黄色的矮小的房子，本来是有名建筑家鲍佛为一个莫斯科商人名为瓦尔金者所建筑，时在十九世纪的二十年代，刚刚打败了拿破仑而莫斯科从瓦砾堆中复兴起来的时候。一八二四年十月二十六日，“莫斯科话剧团”向这商人租得了这座房子，略加改造（因为原来有一个小小的音乐演奏厅），就开场了。至于“莫斯科话剧团”早在一八○六年四月十一日就举行了首次公演，“小戏院”的场址虽迟到一八二四年始有之，但以剧团历史而论，已有一百四十余年之久了。
    “小戏院”的演剧以内容之富有崇高思想及形式之深刻的现实主义为特点。百年以来，“小戏院”始终是文化和教育的坚强堡垒。著名的演员米哈尔·薛乞泼金当十九世纪上半季曾在“小戏院”演戏数十年；薛乞泼金被称为“俄罗斯现实主义的演剧之始祖”，又是思想进步的人，他和当时的大作家普希金、果戈尔、毕林斯基、海尔岑等，都是好朋友。薛乞泼金的时代正是俄国古典文学如果戈尔的“巡按使”，格利鲍也道夫的“聪明误”等剧本出世的时代，“小戏院”即以演出这些剧本之成功而大享盛名，并建立了它的优秀传统。差不多有百年之久，主要的俄罗斯作家的作品，都经过“小戏院”和观众见面。大戏曲家亚历山大·奥斯脱罗夫斯基的作品，由著名的萨度夫斯基（他是奥氏的朋友）及其后裔演出，享盛名凡数十年。奥斯脱罗夫斯基之于“小戏院”，颇有似于乞可夫之于“艺术戏院”，苏联政府为了纪念奥氏的功绩，特在“小戏院”门口建立了奥氏的铜像。奥氏的许多作品都代表了他那时代的进步思想，他作品中的人物代表了那时代俄国社会各阶层。萨度夫斯基家族成为“小戏院”的台柱，老萨度夫斯基的孙子任艺术监督数十年，最近方逝世。
    正如“大戏院”之成为造就歌舞人材之最高学府一样，“小戏院”在百年来也做到了造就话剧人材的最高学府的地位，当十九世纪末年，“小戏院”人材济济，大明星皆出其门下。无论演什么戏，阵容之整齐，一时无出其右。“小戏院”附设有“薛乞泼金话剧学校”，每年有新干部训练出来。
    革命后，“小戏院”改为国立，并锡以“阿卡台米克”的称呼；一九三七年九月复颁给列宁勋章。
    “莫斯科艺术戏院”是斯坦尼斯拉夫斯基和南弥罗维乞·丹青柯（戏曲作家，名符拉迭米尔）在一八九八年所创办，今年要过五十周年纪念了。艺术戏院确可说得上是世界闻名，它的影响及于欧洲、美洲，乃至于东方。
    艺术戏院创办人的理想，第一是要满足当时的进步知识分子的思想要求，第二是要发展他们的新创的演出方法而完成舞台艺术的改革。每一剧本排演以前，导演的任务是对于剧本先作了深刻的心理分析。导演和演员首先必须努力发现那支配剧中人物的行动的动机。这方法，就是著名的所谓“斯坦尼斯拉夫斯基法则”，用斯氏自己的话，这是“一种工作的方法，使得演员能够创造他所担任的角色的性格，能够发现人类心灵的活动，而用了美妙的艺术的形式在舞台上演出。”
    艺术戏院的开台戏是阿莱克舍·康士坦丁诺维乞·托尔斯泰的历史悲剧“沙皇费沃道尔”。这部戏现在还时时在演。接着就演出了乞可夫的“海鸥”。这是别家戏院没有演得成功的戏，但艺术戏院用它的新方法却演的异常出色；这样就奠定了艺术戏院的地位，确定了“斯坦尼斯拉夫斯基法则”的价值。而海鸥也成了艺术戏院的院徽，现在它那浅蓝色的丝绒幕上仍旧绣着银灰色的海鸥。乞可夫和艺术戏院的深挚的友谊也从此建立。乞可夫的最好的作品，如“三姊妹”，“樱桃园”，都是特为艺术戏院写的。
    和艺术戏院的关系不下于乞可夫的，是高尔基。当九十年代末尾，高尔基崛起于文坛光焰万丈的时候，艺术戏院就怂恿他写剧本。于是高尔基写了“小市民”和“下层”。前者在上演前，印刷本业已出版，风行全俄，一年间重版十二次，共销六万部；因此当它于一九○二年十月二十五日首次上演时，观众争先恐后，都以先睹为快，沙皇警察见于此剧哄动之甚，恐发生事端，临时戒备极严，不意演出后反响淡漠，仅演二十三场即告终止。原因是那时的演出忽略了此剧的基本思想——新旧人生观之冲突，而仅渲染了别赛勉诺夫家庭的故事。至于“下层”的演出，则大为成功。在艺术上，和在社会意义上，“下层”的演出都是不容忽视的。
    在乞可夫和高尔基的作品以外，艺术戏院也演出俄罗斯古典作品及西欧古典作品，然而它的最大目的在演思想内容深刻的作品——在作品中表现了对于崇高理想之坚信，并预言合理的平等的社会必将出现，如乞可夫及高尔基在作品中所宣告。当艺术戏院三十五周年纪念的时候，为了纪念高尔基对于艺术戏院的扶助，该院名上冠以高尔基的名字，故它的全名应是“莫斯科高尔基艺术戏院”。
    苏联作家的作品常在艺术戏院演出，自不必说。值得一提的，是一九三七年改编而演出了老托尔斯泰的“安娜·阿莱尼娜”，而得列宁勋章。这是苏联戏院得列宁勋章的第一个。后来，艺术戏院又得了劳动红旗勋章。
    自从它成立到现在（一九四七年上季），艺术戏院上演之戏凡一百十三部，共演一万八千场，观众共约二千万人。高尔基的“下层”，乞可夫的“樱桃园”，都演了千场以上。阿莱克舍·康士坦丁诺维乞·托尔斯泰的“沙皇费沃道尔”演了八百场。艺术戏院的装饰极为幽雅，观众座不很多，约仅五六百而已。
    斯坦尼斯拉夫斯基（卒于一九三八年）和符拉迭米尔·南弥罗维乞·丹青柯（卒于一九四三年）生平都曾注力于训练青年一代的演员和导演。十月革命后，艺术戏院内附设了很多的研究班，后来这些研究班发展而为独立的戏院，如“瓦赫丹果夫戏院”、“斯坦尼斯拉夫斯基·南弥罗维乞·丹青柯音乐戏院”、“斯坦尼斯拉夫斯基歌剧与话剧戏院”。现在，艺术戏院内还附设着一个“南弥罗维乞·丹青柯戏剧学校”专以研究发扬艺术戏院的演剧传统为目标。
