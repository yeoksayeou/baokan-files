Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, June 6th: The Shanghai People's Municipal Government invited representatives from Shanghai's industrial sector on the afternoon of the 2nd to discuss the issue of restoring and developing production. Over 90 industry representatives attended, including Hu Juewen. During the meeting, Mayor Chen Yi expressed sympathy and condolences for the various restrictions and suppressions suffered by Shanghai's national industry under the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang in the past. He also explained that the great construction tasks of the new China have begun, and the People's Government is willing to consult with the industrial sector to achieve the task of restoring and increasing production. Industry representatives spoke one after another, unanimously expressing their praise and support for the policies and discipline of the People's Liberation Army and the People's Government. At the same time, they strongly condemned the Kuomintang bandit gang's destruction and looting of Shanghai's industry and transportation. Hu Juewen of the machinery industry also expressed the hope that the industrial sector would immediately gather colleagues to discuss and formulate a production plan. Jing Shuping of the cigarette industry said in his speech that the industrial sector should not be dependent and should not push difficulties onto the government. Difficulties that can be solved by themselves should be resolved quickly. A distinction should be made between fundamental and stopgap measures, and factories with raw materials should resume work first. Finally, Rao Shushi, Secretary of the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, put forward detailed and clear opinions on the questions raised by everyone. He said that our current difficulties are the difficulties of production and construction. We must solve these difficulties step by step according to the actual situation and to the best of our ability. For those beyond our capacity, the government will also be open and honest, inform everyone, and study democratically. In addition, he also explained issues such as labor-management relations.
