(Tianjin, 26th) The Tianjin Municipal Supply and Marketing Cooperative General Agency recently held a cadre meeting to conduct a thorough review of past business operations and made decisions to improve operations.

In the past five months, more than 300 cooperatives have been established in the city, with more than 470,000 members. A total of more than 13 million catties of grain and daily necessities worth more than 80 million yuan were sold to members. Compared with market prices, this saved the members more than 97 million yuan. In terms of supply quantity, the members' requirements were initially met, such as an average of 15 catties of coarse grains and 10 catties of fine grains per member in April.

The meeting also identified a number of shortcomings: the General Agency's grasp of prices was not sufficient, and sometimes the selling price failed to drop in time after the market price had fallen, causing dissatisfaction among members; when purchasing goods from the grain company, there was no on-site inspection, resulting in the retrieval of a lot of bad or substandard grain, which could not be sold; there was also insufficient contact between various aspects within the cooperative, such as the grain department selling grain, but the storage department did not have enough or any storage, resulting in the grain not being able to be distributed; some lower-level cooperatives did not keep their promises and failed to pay on time, and the General Agency did not strictly enforce disciplinary measures for suspending sales, so that more than 40 million yuan in outstanding debts had not yet been recovered. There was a great deal of blindness in business operations, and very little in-depth investigation was conducted into the urgent needs of the members at the lower levels. The General Agency frequently failed to maintain its credit with the grain company and repay its debts on time. In addition, in the operation of daily necessities, no great effort was made to promote the products of state-owned enterprises, the ability to identify goods was not skilled enough, and sometimes substandard goods were received as good goods, resulting in them not being sold, and funds being tied up, small handicraft products were looked down upon, and their prices were lowered, and the operating cadres had a bureaucratic style.

After a thorough review of these shortcomings, the following decisions were made: 1. In business operations: prepare goods according to the urgent needs of the members. In addition to the items currently being operated, members also requested an increase in soybeans, rice, and white flour (or black flour). Therefore, exchange relations should be strengthened with Northeast China, Shandong, Central Hebei, and Chahar, and goods should be actively exchanged. In the operation of daily necessities, the method of unified procurement should be vigorously implemented. In addition to promoting the products of public enterprises and helping to promote the products of production cooperatives, a portion should also be appropriately and systematically procured from private enterprises. 2. Save on transportation costs, reduce costs, improve quality, and sell to members at prices lower than the market price. It is planned to combine truck or ship transportation with the grain company, and the grain arriving in Tianjin will be unloaded directly at the General Agency's warehouse; or introduce the branch cooperatives to directly pick up goods at the grain company's warehouse, and then distribute them to the street cooperatives in a planned manner. The street cooperatives can only use the grain after approval from the branch cooperative, which can save on transportation costs. When the branch cooperative picks up grain from the General Agency, the sacks will be exchanged and not emptied to save on handling fees; in terms of reducing costs, it is called for the establishment of electric mills or the establishment of relations with private electric mills to process grain themselves to ensure quality. And pay attention to inspection at any time. 3. Strengthen leadership. Various sections and offices should regularly organize work teams to conduct inspections at the lower-level cooperatives, and study and solve problems in a timely manner. Establish a regular meeting system between the various sections to introduce each other's work situation. Establish a sound reporting system to understand the situation in a timely manner in order to guide business.

　　津市合作总社干部会议
  　检讨改进供销业务
  　决定统一采购加强领导
    【天津二十六日电】天津市供销合作总社，日前召开干部会议，对过去业务经营作了深刻检讨，并做出了改进业务的决定。
    总计五个月来，全市共建立了三百余个社，社员四十七万余人，共售给社员粮食一千三百余万斤，日用品总值八千余万元，与市价比较，可省钱九千七百余万元；供给数量上初步满足了社员要求，如四月份平均每个社员合粗粮十五斤、细粮十斤。
    经会中检讨，还存在着不少缺点：总社对物价的掌握还不够，有时市价已下落而售价未能及时降低，引起社员不满；到粮食公司批货不去实地检查，结果取回不少坏粮食或次粮食，卖不出去；社内各方面联系也不够，如粮食股批售了粮食，而保管股没有或存粮不够，结果发不出去；有的下层社不守信用不按期交款，总社对停售的纪律处分执行不严格，以致目前仍有四千多万元的外欠款尚未收回。业务经营上存在很大盲目性，很少深入下层精细调查社员的迫切需要，总社对粮食公司很多次不能保持信用按期归款。此外在日用品的经营上，没有大力推销国营企业的产品，识别货色不够熟练，有时次货当好货收，结果卖不出去，积压资金，对小手工业的产品看不起，压低其价格，经营干部存有官僚作风。
    这些缺点，经大家深刻检讨后，作出如下决定：一、业务经营上：根据社员迫切需要来准备商品。除目前经营的物品外，社员还要求增加吉豆、大米、白面（或黑面）因此应与东北、山东、冀中、察哈尔等地加强交换关系，主动交换货物。日用品的经营，应大力贯彻统一采购办法，除推销公营企业的产品，帮助推销生产社的产品外，并适当的有计划的到私营企业采购一部。二、节省运费，减轻成本，提高质量，用低于市价售给社员。计划与粮食公司结合车运或船运，来津粮食直接到总社仓库卸货；或者介绍分社直接去粮食公司仓库取货，然后有计划的分到各街社保存，街社需用多少经分社批准始可动用，这样，可节省来往运费，分社到总社取粮时，双方换麻袋不再倒袋子，以节省手续费；在减低成本方面，号召建立电磨或与私人电磨建立关系，自己加工，以保证质量。并随时注意检查。三、加强领导。各科、室经常组织工作组，到下层社进行检查，发现问题及时研究和解决，各科之间建立定期会议制度，互相介绍工作情况。建立健全汇报制度及时了解情况，以便指导业务。
