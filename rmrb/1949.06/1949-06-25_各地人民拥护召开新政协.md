(Comprehensive report by this newspaper) The news of the establishment of the Preparatory Committee of the New Political Consultative Conference spread to Suiyuan, Ulanhot, Xi'an, Hangzhou, and other places. Workers, farmers, students, and people from all walks of life were overjoyed, seeing a bright future ahead. With boundless determination, they expressed their intention to celebrate by increasing production, studying diligently, and fully supporting the New Political Consultative Conference and the coalition government, taking practical actions to complete economic and cultural construction under the banner of Chairman Mao.

    Suiyuan
    Workers at the Suiyuan No. 1 Flour Mill were very happy to hear about the establishment of the Preparatory Committee of the New Political Consultative Conference. They successively formulated production plans and increased output to support the People's Liberation Army in quickly eliminating the Kuomintang reactionaries. Railway worker Wu Fenglin, just returning from his shift, didn't even eat dinner, and asked someone to read the newspaper to him. He repeatedly and excitedly said, "Our new Chinese government should have been established long ago. We workers have been waiting for it so eagerly!" Wu Hongxun, manager of the private Yixingcheng Egg Factory in Fengzhen, particularly pointed out: The Communist Party of China, the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang, and the China Democratic League all sent seven representatives. This is the best demonstration of the Communist Party's sincerity and impartiality. Farmer Ma Shun, returning home from the fields with a hoe on his shoulder, was very happy to hear that farmers were sending representatives to participate in the national governing conference, and his mouth couldn't close for a long time. He kept saying: Now our farmers can also send representatives to the "yamen" (government office) to handle affairs. This is truly democracy. This is thanks to the leadership of Chairman Mao and the Communist Party. We farmers will definitely support the establishment of this new Chinese government.

    Ulanhot
    In Ulanhot, workers from all factories held a discussion meeting on the evening of the 21st. Many workers expressed that they would work hard to produce. Students from the Inner Mongolia Military and Political University and Xing'an Middle School scrambled to listen to the broadcast of Chairman Mao's and Commander-in-Chief Zhu's speeches at the Preparatory Committee of the New Political Consultative Conference. They resolved to study hard so that they could serve the construction of the new China in the future. The Inner Mongolia Autonomous Government's congratulatory telegram on the establishment of the Preparatory Committee of the New Political Consultative Conference said: We deeply believe that the New Political Consultative Conference, led by the Communist Party of China, which will be convened soon, will enable the various ethnic minorities within China, who have long been in a backward state under the rule and oppression of imperialism and the Kuomintang reactionaries' Han chauvinism, to gradually move towards prosperity and well-being.

    Xi'an
    Workers and students in Xi'an expressed that they would celebrate the establishment of the Preparatory Committee of the New Political Consultative Conference and welcome the birth of the new China by stepping up production and construction, studying revolutionary knowledge hard, and transforming and cultivating themselves. All commanders and fighters of the First Field Army will celebrate the soon-to-be-established people's democratic coalition government with new victories. Yang Mingxuan, the head of the Northwest General Branch of the China Democratic League, and democratic figures in the Northwest all expressed their full support for the proposals of the Preparatory Committee of the New Political Consultative Conference.

    Hangzhou
    On the morning of the 21st in Hangzhou, the streets were crowded with people scrambling to buy newspapers. The newspaper reading boards in front of newspaper offices and the reading rooms of Xinhua bookstores were packed with readers. Worker Wu Jie said: The people have been yearning for the New Political Consultative Conference like a severe drought yearns for rain clouds, and finally, we have been waiting for it! Zhejiang University professors Yan Rengeng and Zhang Junchuan stated: The convening of the Preparatory Committee of the New Political Consultative Conference is an epoch-making event in Chinese history. It will lead a decaying and collapsing old era to a truly independent, democratic, unified, and peaceful new era.
