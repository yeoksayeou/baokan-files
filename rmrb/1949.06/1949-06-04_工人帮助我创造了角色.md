　　"Bridge" is about to start filming.

　　This is a formal feature film from Dongbei Film Studio. The director wants me to play the role of "Factory Director" in the play. This is the embodiment of the Party and the first time the Party's representative meets the audience on the screen. From this role, the correct leadership of the Party should be reflected, and it should be seen how the Party "comes from the masses and goes to the masses," using unparalleled perseverance to mobilize the working class's great production enthusiasm and intelligence to overcome all difficulties and complete the task of supporting the war.

　　I remember when I was acting in Shanghai, I learned from foreign films. During the Anti-Japanese War, I lived with the troops and farmers for a long time, so I was relatively familiar with them. When acting, I could grasp some of their emotions, thoughts, and activities. But this time, I have to play an old cadre from a worker's background, who is also a representative of the Party. In addition, I haven't been involved in films for more than ten years, so I am quite rusty. This really makes me feel anxious and at a loss.

　　I visited some responsible comrades in factories and gained some inspiration from their work, study, and life. But it was not enough, because most of these responsible comrades were intellectuals. Although they were intellectuals who had become workers and peasants, it was impossible to completely find the unique temperament of this role in them.

　　When filming began, I constantly visited many workers and got some inspiration from several factory directors who were workers. On the first day of filming (at the Harbin Railway Factory), when I was putting on makeup, many workers came to watch. They commented while watching the makeup:

　　"It would be better if he were older." "Hmm! The beard on his face resembles our factory director, but he can't have a Fu Manchu mustache!"

　　"Yes, yes! That's right! This makes him look mature!"

　　"You should smile more often. Our former Factory Director X was like that..."

　　From my makeup to putting on clothes, and finally even the voice, smile, and walking... they gave me very valuable advice. They wanted to help me create an image that was familiar and亲切to them. That day, the workers gave me the first lesson.

　　Later, during the two or three months of on-location shooting in the factory, from the director to the actors, we all received a lot of help and valuable opinions from the worker comrades.

　　They not only gave us advice, but sometimes also took action to revise our lines, sets, and lighting. Some also put on makeup and filmed with us. Once, in the cold, foggy morning, a worker from an electric light factory climbed such a high pole to help us erect high-voltage lines in the open air. Unfortunately, he fell and was seriously injured. But the workers from the electric light factory immediately continued their efforts. More people came immediately and finally erected the high-voltage lines, ensuring the work.

　　Many workers from other factories helped us perform group scenes. They worked eight hours during the day. As soon as they got off work, they immediately helped us film at night until late at night. The next day, they still went to work as usual, and filmed as usual...…

　　The workers' spirit of being masters of their own affairs moved me very much. Film is still a newborn baby in the liberated areas, and the worker comrades care for her meticulously. They were afraid that this child would not be good-looking or promising when she grew up.

　　The theme of "Bridge" is to depict the working class's selfless deeds in supporting the war. And when filming this play, the help the workers gave her was also selfless.

　　I felt it deeply and finally understood and appreciated the wisdom and intelligence of the working class. They are indeed omniscient and omnipotent. Under this inspiration, I found my role step by step.

　　I am ashamed that my acting skills are too low and my overall cultivation is not enough. The filming is over, and I think my role is not successful. But I deeply recognize the great wisdom of the working class and will learn from them more humbly in the future.

### 工人帮助我创造了角色

　　工人帮助我创造了角色
    吕班
    “桥”要开拍了。
    这是东影的一部正式故事片，导演同志要我扮演剧中“厂长”这一角色，这是党的化身，也是党的代表在银幕上第一次与观众见面。从这个角色身上要体现出党的正确领导来，要看出党是怎样“从群众中来，又到群众中去”，以无比的毅力发动工人阶级伟大的生产热情和智力，克服一切困难，完成支援战争的任务。
    记得早先在上海演戏时，是向外国电影学习的；抗战中长期的和部队、农民生活在一起，对他们是比较熟悉的，演戏时亦还可以掌握他们的一些情感、思想、活动。可是这次要演一个工人出身的老干部，又是党的代表，加以自己十来年不搞电影已经相当生疏，这真是使我惶惶然无从下手了。
    我曾去访问过一些工厂的负责同志，从他们的工作、学习、生活中得到了些启示。但还不够，因为这些负责同志大部是知识分子出身的，他们虽是工农化了的知识分子，还不可能在他们身上完全找到象这个角色所特有的气质来。
    开始摄制时，我不断的访问了好多工友们，从几位工人出身的分厂长身上得到些启发。开拍的第一天（在哈铁工厂中）我正在化装时，有好多工友跑来参观，他们边看化装边发议论：
    “年纪再大些就好了。”“晤！脸上有胡＠象咱们的厂长，可不能留八字胡！”
    “唉，唉！对了！这样显得老成！”
    “你要常常笑着点，咱们从前的×厂长就是这样……”
    他们从我化装，直到我穿起衣服，最后连声音、笑容、走路……都给了我很宝贵的意见，他们要帮助我创造一个为他们所熟悉而亲切的形象，这天工友们给我上了第一课。
    以后在工厂中两三个月的实地拍摄中，从导演到演员，都从工人同志们那里得到了很多的帮助和可贵的意见。
    他们不但给我们提意见，有时还亲自下手，给我们修正台词对话，布景，搞灯光，有的也化了装和我们一起拍戏。有一次在严寒大雾的清晨，一位电灯厂的工人为了帮助我们在露天架高压线，爬上了那么高的杆子，不幸失足摔下来受了重伤，但电灯厂的工友们立刻再接再厉，立刻来了更多的人，终于把高压线架好，保证了工作。
    其他厂的许多工友们，成群的帮助我们表演群众场面，他们白天八小时工作，刚下班，紧接着晚上就帮我们拍戏，拍到深夜，第二天还照常上班，照常拍戏………。
    工友们这种作主人的精神，使我万分感动。电影在解放区还是个新生的婴儿，工人同志们对她的爱护是无微不至的。他们生怕这个孩子长大后不好看，没出息。
    “桥”的主题，是描写工人阶级在支援战争中奋不顾身的事迹的，而在拍摄这部戏时，工人们给予她的帮助也正是奋不顾身的。
    我心感身受，终于理解体会到工人阶级的智慧与聪明。他们确实是无所不知无所不能的，在这种感召下，我一步一步的找到了我的角色。
    惭愧的是我的演剧技术太低，各方面的修养不够，戏是拍完了，我认为我这一角色是不成功的。但是我深深的认识了工人阶级的伟大智慧，今后将更虚心的向他们学习。
