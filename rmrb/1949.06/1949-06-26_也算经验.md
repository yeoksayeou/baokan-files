　　Also Considered Experience
    Zhao Shuli
    In recent years, friends who have excessively praised me have asked me to talk about my writing experience, but I have never done so. As someone who is not a professional writer, having written a few small books, even if I have some experience, it's nothing more than experiences from life and other work. To talk about them as "writing experience," I always feel embarrassed. Now, several more friends are asking me to talk about it. I answered them with the above reasons, and some of them said, "Those 'experiences' can also be discussed. Since everyone wants you to talk, if you are too stubborn, people will misunderstand that you are putting on airs." Okay! Let's talk then!

    First, let's talk about obtaining materials: most of my materials are picked up, and often I run into them head-on, so I can't avoid picking them up even if I want to. Because my family was transformed from a middle peasant to a poor peasant under the oppression of usury, and I myself had attended school for a few days, and I was doing local work when the Anti-Japanese War started, so I dealt with the characters in my few small books every day, and everything I participated in was on one aspect of those things. For example, Er Zhuge in "Xiao Erhei Gets Married" is a miniature of my father, and Xingwang and Jinwang are the old dregs in my work area; the old and young generations of characters in "Li Youcai's Rhymes" are my neighbors, and many are friends; my uncle was the one forced into bankruptcy by the "eight-as-ten" usury of Sixth Master in "Changes in Li Family Village." The garrison of Yan Xishan's 48th Division in the same book was my residence in Taiyuan at the time. Occasions like "Blood Stains the Dragon King Temple" in the same book stained the blood of many of my old colleagues, and I myself almost got stained in it... All of this is the source of my writing materials. Since most of the materials are picked up in this way, naturally there's no experience to talk about in collecting them. If it can be considered experience, I can only say that "working among the masses and living among the masses are two simple ways to obtain materials."

    Next, let's talk about deciding on the theme: in the process of doing mass work, the problems that I encountered that had to be solved but were not easily solved often became the theme I wanted to write about. This is true in the few small books I wrote, except for the reports on the two labor heroes "Meng Xiangying Overturns" and "Pang Rulin." For example, some very enthusiastic young colleagues did not understand the actual situation in the countryside and were misled by superficial work achievements, so I wrote "Li Youcai's Rhymes"; rural customs mistakenly believe that renting out land is not purely exploitation, so I wrote "Floor" (referring to arable land, not the floor in a house)... If it can also be considered experience, it can be said that "the theme found in work is easy to produce the significance of guiding reality."

    Language and others: I am a person who is both from a peasant background and has attended school, so naturally I have to talk to both peasants and intellectuals. Sometimes when I return to my hometown from school and talk to my elders and brothers in the countryside, I often unconsciously bring a bit of student tone, but as soon as I bring out that kind of tone, I will immediately be criticized by them. After hitting a few nails, I learned to be good, and later even when introducing intellectuals' words to them, I would try to translate the intellectuals' words into their words. After a long time, it became a habit. It's the same with writing articles – I pay attention to this aspect: I'm not used to hearing "however," so I write "but"; "therefore" is a bit stiff, so I write "therefore." If I don't change them into easy-to-use words, they won't want to read them. The same principle applies to sentences as to words – if the sentences are long, people can't grasp them as a whole, so why not make them shorter and say a few more sentences: "The rooster crows" and "The dog barks" are very natural, why write "The rooster is crowing" and "The dog is barking"? As for the structure of the story, I also try to take care of the habits of the masses: the masses like to hear stories, so I enhance the story-telling; they like to hear continuous stories, so I don't often cut off the story because I want to be concise. I think as long as I can get most people to read it, it's not a losing deal. As for whether this will lower the artistic quality of the work, I think that is another question, but I don't have much capital in this area, so I haven't felt like I've lost out. These are my attitudes towards the use of language and story structure, which can also be considered experience.

    The experience I can talk about is only this much. As for the writing process of each specific thing, they are all ordinary and not worth talking about, so I won't talk about them much.

　　也算经验
    赵树理
    近几年来，过分推崇我的朋友们，要我谈谈写作的经验，可是我一次也没有谈。一个并非专门写作的人，写了几个小册子，即使有点经验，也不过是些生活和其他工作中的经历，作为“写作经验”来谈，我总觉得不好意思。现在又有几位朋友要我谈，我用上边的理由回答了他们，他们有人说：“那些‘经历’也可以谈谈。大家既然要你谈，你要太固执，人家就要误会你是摆架子。”好！谈就谈谈吧！
    先从取得材料谈起：我的材料大部分是拾来的，而且往往是和材料走得碰了头，想不拾也躲不开。因为我的家庭是在高利贷压迫之下由中农变为贫农的，我自己又上过几天学，抗日战争开始又作的是地方工作，所以每天尽和我那几个小册子中的人物打交道，所参与的也尽在那些事情的一方面。例如“小二黑结婚”中的二诸葛就是我父亲的缩影，兴旺、金旺就是我工作地区的旧渣滓；“李有才板话”中老字和小字辈的人物就是我的邻里，而且有好多是朋友；我的叔父，正是被“李家庄变迁”中六老爷的“八当十”高利贷逼得破了产的人。同书中阎锡山的四十八师留守处，就是我当日在太原的寓所。同书中“血染龙王庙”之类的场合，染了我好多老同事的血，连我自己也差一点染到里边去……这一切便是我写作材料的来源。材料既然大部分是这样拾来的，自然谈不到什么搜集的经验，要说也算经验的话，只能说“在群众中工作和在群众中生活，是两个取得材料的简易办法”。
    再谈谈决定主题：我在作群众工作的过程中，遇到了非解决不可而又不是轻易能解决了的问题，往往就变成所要写的主题。这在我写的几个小册子中，除了“孟祥英翻身”与“庞如林”两个劳动英雄的报导以外，还没有例外。如有些很热心的青年同事，不了解农村中的实际情况，为表面上的工作成绩所迷惑，我便写“李有才板话”；农村习惯上误以为出租土地也不纯是剥削，我便写“地板”（指耕地，不是房子里的地板）……假如也算经验的话，可以说“在工作中找到的主题，容易产生指导现实的意义”
    语言及其他：我既是个农民出身而又上过学校的人，自然是既不得不与农民说话，又不得不与知识分子说话。有时候从学校回到家乡，向乡间父老兄弟们谈起话来，一不留心，也往往带一点学生腔，可是一带出那等腔调，立时就要遭到他们的议论，碰惯了钉子就学了点乖，以后即使向他们介绍知识分子的话，也要设法把知识分子的话翻译成他们的话来说，时候久了就变成了习惯。说话如此，写起文章来便也在这方面留神——“然而”听不惯，咱就写成“可是”；“所以”生一点，咱就写成“因此”不给他们换成顺当的字眼儿，他们就不愿意看。字眼儿如此，句子也是同样的道理——句子长了人家听起来捏不到一块儿，何妨简短些多说几句：“鸡叫”“狗咬”本来很习惯，何必写成“鸡在叫”“狗在咬”呢？至于故事的结构，我也是尽量照顾群众的习惯：群众爱听故事，咱就增强故事性；爱听连贯的，咱就不要因为讲求剪裁而常把故事割断了。我以为只要能叫大多数人读，总不算赔钱买卖。至于会不会因此就降低了作品的艺术性，我以为那是另一问题，不过我在这方面本钱就不多，因此也没有感觉到有赔了的时候。这些就是我在运用语言和故事结构上所抱的态度，也可以算做经验。
    我所能谈的经验只此而已，至于每个具体东西的写作过程，都是普普通通不值一谈的，因而也就不多谈了。
