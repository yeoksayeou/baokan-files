　　Tianjin Customs Simplifies Customs Declaration Procedures
  　Flexible Methods for Filling Out Licenses
    [Our Newspaper] To facilitate import and export merchants, Tianjin Customs has simplified some administrative procedures. The import and export declarations, which were originally received by the Tax Section, are now received by the declaration desk of the Valuation Section. The declarations are received, and the goods are directly inspected and valued. After all the procedures are completed, they are sent to the Tax Section for approval and release in one go. This eliminates the trouble of repeatedly submitting declarations from the Tax Section to the Valuation Section in the past. This allows an average of half a day to be saved on each declaration.
    [Another Report] When applying for export licenses from the Tianjin Foreign Trade Bureau, exporters are required to specify the ship name and sailing date. However, ship schedules are often inaccurate these days, and exporters often have to apply to change the sailing date and ship name. Recently, in order to facilitate exporters, the Bureau has accepted opinions from all parties and has notified Customs that when the ship name or departure date of the export cargo does not match the original license, as long as it is within the validity period of the license, Customs can temporarily add a note for release without having to apply to the Bureau again. In this way, exporters can load cargo as soon as a ship is available after obtaining an export license, saving both time and effort.

　　津海开简化报单手续
  　许可证填写亦有变通办法
    【本报讯】津海关为便利进出口商，已将行政手续部分简化，把原由税务课接收的进出口报单，改由验估课报单台接收。报单收进即直接验货估价，等全部手续完后，一次送税务课核准放行。这样就免去了过去报单自税务课转交验估课的反复送单的麻烦。这样平均每张报单可以提前半日办完。
    【又讯】天津出口商对外贸易管理局申请出口许可证时，规定须注明船名及船期。但目前船期常不准确，出口商常常要呈请更改船期船名。最近该局为便利出口商，接受各方意见，已通知海关，凡出口货运载船名或起运日期和原发许可证不符时，只要在许可证有效期内，海关可以临时加注放行，不用再向管理局申请。这样，出口商领到出口许可证后，就可有船即装，省事又省时。
