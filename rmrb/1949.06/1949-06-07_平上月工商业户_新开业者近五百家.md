    Private Industrial and Commercial Businesses in Beiping: Nearly 500 New Businesses Opened Last Month
    [Our Newspaper] The number of industrial (all small-scale handicrafts) and commercial businesses opening in Beiping is gradually increasing. In the four months since liberation, the number of industrial and commercial businesses opening is about twice the number closing. According to statistics from the Beiping Municipal Bureau of Industry and Commerce, 485 businesses opened in May, with shops supplying people's daily necessities accounting for the majority, such as oil and salt shops, rice and flour stores, stationery shops, and coal shops. 244 businesses closed, and 150 changed their line of business or moved elsewhere. The businesses that closed or changed their line of business were mostly shops that were detached from the needs of the majority of the people, such as the gold and silver jewelry industry, with 16 closing and 22 changing their line of business in just the last ten days of May (May 20th to May 31st).

    平上月工商业户  新开业者近五百家
    【本报讯】平市工（均为小型手工业）商业开业者日渐增多。解放后四个月来，开业工商业之家数较歇业家数约多一倍。据平市工商局统计，五月份开业者四八五家，以供应人民生活必需品的商店占多数，如油盐店、米面庄、文具店、煤铺等。歇业者二四四家，转业或更东者一五○家，歇业与转业者多为脱离大多数群众需要之商店，如金银首饰业，仅五月下旬（五月二十日至三十一日）就有十六家歇业，二十二家转业。
