    Chairman Mao!
    Thanks to you,
    For giving me such a great idea!
    　　　　　——Folk Song
    I.
    Black Old Cai kept the marriage of Da Shui and Xiao Mei in mind, always wanting to find time to resolve it for them, but he was too busy with work and never got around to it.

    During this time, the regular army on the outer lines had won several beautiful victories in succession; the local Party in the enemy's rear led the masses and carried out countless victorious struggles; the situation everywhere had opened up. This area had also returned to the situation before the large-scale mopping-up operations by the enemy. County and district organizations were newly strengthened, village political power was consolidated day by day, and various armed forces were expanded more than before. It was just that since the enemy's mopping-up operations, many landlords had taken advantage of the chaos to counter-settle accounts with the peasants, reclaiming land, seizing tenants, and forcing them to pay several years of "back rent," taking all the grain away. People eat grain, and no one can resist Japan while starving. As soon as the democratic government was restored, the masses demanded rent reduction. County and district cadres went to the countryside one after another to lead this movement. Who would have thought that Da Shui and Xiao Mei would have conflicts over rent reduction?

    Xiao Mei was assigned to Shenjia Village. This day, she led the peasant representatives to Shen Yaozong's house to reason with him. This time, Shen Yaozong was particularly polite to the peasants, nodding and bowing, inviting them to sit down, and asking them what was the matter. As soon as he heard that they wanted to reduce rent, he smiled and said, "Reducing rent is a good thing. I have no objection at all. Now that you folks have come, I am extremely welcome, welcome—most welcome! Anyway, everything is easy to talk about, everything is easy to talk about!" The representatives saw that his attitude was good and felt that the matter would not be difficult to handle, so they relaxed. They said, "Since Mr. Shen agrees, that's good! Let's discuss it."

    Shen Yaozong talked progressively on the surface, but he was stalling for time in secret. He had heard the news these days and was prepared. After a while, the servants set the table. Shen Yaozong stood up, his face full of smiles, and stretched out a hand, saying, "Please, please! You folks don't come to my place easily. This is just a small token of my appreciation."

    Xiao Mei felt it was inappropriate to eat his food, so she declined, saying, "It's still early. We have other things to do after we finish talking." Shen Yaozong was unwilling to let her go, shouting, "Comrade Yang, do you not eat when you work? If you are not hungry, everyone else is hungry; if everyone else is not hungry, I am hungry; isn't it the same if we eat and talk?" Seeing Xiao Mei hesitate, he quickly said, "Comrade Yang, if you come to my place to talk about work today and don't eat a meal, you are looking down on me! When the Japanese devils were here, you often came to my house, ate, and drank, and didn't treat me like an outsider. If you go to eat elsewhere today, where will I put my old face!" Without waiting for Xiao Mei to answer, Shen Yaozong pulled her and pushed her to the seat of honor. Xiao Mei was embarrassed to insist, so she sat down. Shen Yaozong immediately said to the representatives, "Haha, everyone, do I need to invite you one by one? We are all from the same village, either elders or younger generations, all family members, please sit down quickly!" The representatives saw Xiao Mei sit down and could not refuse, so they sat around the table.

    That day, Shen Yaozong wore a small felt hat, a short cotton jacket, and tied cotton leggings, always with a smiling face, and he really didn't look like a landlord. He toasted everyone one by one and then started talking. In the middle of his speech, he praised Yang Xiao Mei and the representatives, and boasted about his contributions to resisting Japan. After listening, everyone felt as if he was really one of their own, and they became less vigilant.

    Shen Yaozong kept urging them to eat and drink, and the conversation slowly turned to the issue of rent reduction. He complained a lot, saying, "Anyway, you all know my situation. Although I have the name of a rich man, I am actually quite poor; however, if you say I am poor, I am still better off than you. How to reduce it is up to you! I have no objection at all!"

    Xiao Mei brought up the rent reduction decree item by item, asking Shen Yaozong to say: Implement it. Shen Yaozong agreed readily, and they agreed to draw up a new contract tomorrow. Everyone saw that he was very forthright and felt that he was truly enlightened; they originally wanted to counter-settle accounts and ask him to return the extra rent he had demanded before, but "if you take something from someone, you will be lenient; if you eat someone's food, you will be lenient," so they were embarrassed to bring it up.

    II.

    The next day, under the auspices of the farmers' association, the landlord and tenant parties drew up new contracts at the village office. Shen Yaozong originally had two *qing* of land, of which forty *mu* had been transferred to the peasants of Sunjia Village to rent because Sunjia Village lacked land when the rent was reduced in 1938; for the remaining one hundred and sixty *mu*, he only drew up a lease for one hundred *mu*.

    Representative Wei Dameng said, "Alas! We still don't have enough land to plant!" Shen Yaozong wanted to shift the focus, secretly pulling Wei Dameng aside and saying, "Sunjia Village is still planting forty *mu* of my land. You represent the interests of the villagers, why don't you go get it back? Our village has so little land, but they have endless land to plant—" Wei Dameng had always been impulsive, and when Shen Yaozong provoked him like this, he shouted these words to the other representatives.

    Everyone also felt that this was right, so they consulted with Xiao Mei, saying, "Our village doesn't have enough land to plant, we have to get back the forty *mu* of land from Sunjia Village!" Xiao Mei said, "If you take it back, what will they do if they don't have enough land to plant?" Wei Dameng said, "Hey, they have endless land to plant!" Xiao Mei asked them if Sunjia Village really lacked land. The representatives scrambled to say, "Even if they don't lack, they will say they do, who wouldn't want to plant more land!" "We don't even have enough land to plant ourselves, why are we letting them plant it?" An eighty-year-old representative, nicknamed "Old Ancestor," said, "If they lack land, they can find their own way, we can't take care of that much!" The young Liu Xier said, "We are starving ourselves, but sending white flour rolls to others!"

    They said one sentence after another, making Xiao Mei's ears soften; she didn't understand the situation and felt that what they said made sense, thinking to herself: "Then let's take the land back! ... This matter will be easy to handle, Da Shui is in Sunjia Village." At the thought of Da Shui, her heart warmed. She dismissed the representatives to discuss other matters first, and stayed alone in the room. She opened her notebook, tore off a piece of paper, and carefully wrote with her fountain pen: Comrade Niu Da Shui:

    Are you busy with work lately? Are you in good health? Is your work going smoothly? I think your work must be successful! You must give me a lot of guidance and help regarding your experiences and lessons! I am writing to you today not for anything else, but to discuss a problem with you, which is that our village has little land, and the representatives want to get back the forty *mu* of land that was previously allocated to you, because there is really not enough land to plant! Please study and consider it! I hope you will reply with a letter! Also, my work is going smoothly, and I am in good health, so don't worry too much! I won't talk much, goodbye!

    With best regards!

    And wishing you success in your mission!

    Yang Xiao Mei November 1st

    After she finished writing, she silently read it again; she took out a small oval seal and stamped it under her name. She wrote the address on the envelope and gave it to a villager to send to Sunjia Village.

    Da Shui knew it was Xiao Mei's letter as soon as he saw the handwriting on the envelope, and he felt sweet inside. He read it twice in a row, then immediately pulled out his black fountain pen and wrote a reply: Comrade Yang Xiao Mei:

    I was very happy to receive your letter and learn that your work is going smoothly and you are in good health. As for your request for me to give you a lot of help, alas! I feel so sorry for you, I think about visiting your village every day, but I am too busy to leave, I guess I am too preoccupied with affairs! Alas! Alas! I am very ashamed of this! In the future, we must meet more often and have more contact, and learn from each other in work, study, culture, and politics, this is what I am looking forward to! Also, regarding the question you raised, I don't know, I am clueless, it is best to invite you here so we can discuss it in person to solve it! Come quickly! Be sure to come! I have a lot of things to talk to you about!

    With kind regards!

    And wishing you good health and success in your work!

    Niu Da Shui Immediately

    After Da Shui finished writing the letter, he took out a square seal and stamped it neatly under his name; then he gave the letter to the villager to take back to Shenjia Village.

    Xiao Mei was very excited when she received Da Shui's reply. Early the next morning, she led the representatives to Shenjia Village. "Old Ancestor" was quite sturdy; because he was concerned about the forty *mu* of land, he also followed along with a cane.

　　新儿女英雄传
    袁静　孔厥
  　第十五回　指引
    毛主席呀！
    亏了你，
    给俺想出好主意！
    　　　　　——民谣
    一
    黑老蔡结记着大水小梅的婚姻问题，总想抽空儿给他们解决，可是工作太忙，老是顾不上。
    这期间，正规军在外线，接连打了几个漂亮的胜仗；地方党在敌后，领导群众，作了无数次胜利的斗争；到处局面都打开了。这一带地区也恢复了大扫荡以前的情况。县区组织从新健全起来，村政权也一天天巩固，各级武装比以前更加扩大了。只是从敌人扫荡以来，好些地主趁火打劫，向农民倒算、收地、夺佃、逼交几年的“欠租”，把粮食都刮走了。人是吃五谷的呀，谁也不能饿着肚子抗日。民主政府一恢复，群众都要求减租。县区干部又纷纷下乡，领导这一运动。谁想到减租中间，大水小梅可闹起矛盾来了。
    小梅分配在申家庄。这天她领着农民代表，到申耀宗家去说理。这一回申耀宗对农民特别客气，点头哈腰的让了坐，问他们有什么事。一听说要减租，他就笑嘻嘻的说：“减租是好事么，兄弟完全没有意见。诸位乡亲既然来了，兄弟是竭力欢迎，欢迎——之至！反正，一切都好说，一切都好说！”代表们看他态度不错，觉得事儿不难办，心就放宽了；说：“既是申先生同意，这就好！咱们合计合计吧。”
    申耀宗嘴上说得挺进步，东拉西扯，暗里磨撑时间。这几天他听到风声，早就有了准备。一会儿，作活的就摆上席了。申耀宗站起来，满脸堆笑，伸着一只手说：“请吧请吧！诸位轻易不到我这儿来，这也是兄弟的一点小意思。”
    小梅一看这形势，觉得吃他的饭不妥当，就推说：“时候还早呢。咱们谈完了，还有旁的事儿。”申耀宗哪里肯依，嚷着：“杨同志，你干工作就不吃饭啊？你不饿，大伙也饿了；大伙不饿，我也饿了；咱们吃着说着还不是一样？”他看小梅犹疑不定，忙说：“杨同志，你们今天到我这儿谈工作，不吃我一顿饭，就是瞧不起我！以前日本鬼子在的时候，你常来我家，也吃，也喝，没把我当外人看待；今天你要到旁处去吃饭，你看我这个老脸往哪儿搁呀！”申耀宗不等小梅答话，就拉拉扯扯的把她推到上座。小梅不好意思坚持，只好座下了。申耀宗马上对代表们说：“哈，你们诸位，还用我一个个请吗？都是乡里乡亲的，不是大一辈，就是小一辈，全是一家人，快坐下吧！”代表们看小梅坐了，也不好推却，就围着桌子坐下了。
    这天，申耀宗戴着小毡帽，穿着短棉袄，扎着棉裤腿儿，老是陪着笑脸，简直看不出是个地主的架势啦。他给大伙儿一个个敬了酒，就卖开嘴了。说话中间，他把杨小梅和代表们捧了一顿，又把自己抗日的功劳表了一番。大伙儿听了，仿佛觉得他真是自家人，心上可就不戒备了。
    申耀宗又一劲儿的让吃让喝，话头儿就慢慢转到减租的问题上来。他诉了许多苦，说：“反正我这光景你们也知道，虽然我挂个财主的名儿，其实也是挺困难；不过，说困难么，总比你们众人强一点。怎么个减法，你们看着办吧！兄弟决没有意见！”
    小梅把减租法令一条条提出来，叫申耀宗说：实行。申耀宗满口答应，约定明天就立新契。大伙儿看他挺痛快，觉得他真是开明；本来还要反倒算，叫他吐出以前多要的租子的，可是“拿了人的手软，吃了人的口软”，也就不好意思提出来了。
    二
    第二天起，农会主持，在村公所，给主佃双方立新契约。申耀宗原有两顷地，里面有四十亩在一九三八年减租的时候，因为孙家庄地缺，政府把它调剂给孙家庄的农民租种了；剩下一百六十亩，他可只立了一百亩的租约。
    代表魏大猛说：“哎呀！咱们这地还是不够种么！”申耀宗想转移目标，暗里拉着魏大猛说：“孙家庄还种着我四十亩地呢。你们代表本村群众的利益，还不去要回来？咱村的地这么缺，人家的地可种不尽呢—”魏大猛向来是一冲子性儿，给他这么一挑拨，就把这些话儿对旁的代表嚷嚷开了。
    大伙儿也觉得这话不错，就找小梅商量说：“咱村的地不够种，得把孙家庄四十亩地要回来！”小梅说：“你们要了，他们地不够种怎么办呢？”魏大猛说：“嗨，人家的地可种不尽呢！”小梅问他们，孙家庄的地到底缺不缺。代表们抢着说：“他们不缺也会说缺么，谁不愿意多种点儿地呀！”“我们自个儿的地还不够种咧，为什么让给他们种呀？”有个八十岁的代表，外号“老祖宗”的，说：“他们缺地；他们自个儿想办法，咱们可管不了那么些！”年轻的柳喜儿说：“咱们自个儿挨饿，倒把白面卷子送给别人吃！”
    他们你一句，我一句，说得小梅耳朵根子软了；她又不了解情况，觉得他们说的挺有道理，心里盘算：“这么着就把地要回来吧！……这事儿到好办，大水在孙家庄呢。”一想起大水，她心里就热呼呼的。她打发代表们先去讨论旁的事儿，自己一个人留在屋里，打开记录本，撕下一张纸，用她的花杆儿水笔用心的写着：牛大水同志：
    你近来工作忙吧？身体好吧？工作顺利吧？我想你工作一定有成绩的！你有什么经验教训要多多指导我呀！多多帮助我呀！今写信不为别事，就是有一个问题和你谈谈，就是我们这个村地少，代表们想要以前泼去的四十亩地要回来种，实在地不够种呀！你们研究研究吧！考虑考虑吧！希你来一个信答复好吧！再者我的工作顺利，身体很好，多多的放心吧！别不多谈，再见吧！
    此致敬礼！
    并祝你完成任务！
    杨小梅　十一月一日
    她写完，又默默的念了一遍；掏出一个椭圆形的小手章，在她的名字底下盖了个印。写好信封，交给一个老乡，送到孙家庄去了。
    大水一看信封上的笔迹，就知道是小梅写来的信，心里觉得甜丝丝的。他一连念了两遍，立刻拔出他的黑杆儿水笔，写了一封回信：杨小梅同志：
    接到你的来信，知你工作顺利，身体健康，心里真是欢喜不尽的，关于你要我多多帮助你，唉！想起来我太对不起你的，我天天想到你村看看，可是忙的走不开，大概我是犯事务啦！唉！唉！这是我很饱愧的！今后咱们一定要多见面，多连系，工作上学习上文化上政治上互相学习，这是我很盼望的！再者关于你提的那个问题，我也不知道，不摸头，最好请你们来这儿，咱们当面谈谈才好解决的！快来吧！一定来吧！我还有好些话和你谈的！
    此致布礼！
    并祝你身体健康工作顺利！
    牛大水即
    大水写完信，掏出一个方形的手章，在他的名字底下，也端端正正的盖了个印；就把信交给那位老乡，带回申家庄去了。
    小梅接到大水的回信，很兴奋。第二天一早，就领着代表们到申家庄去。“老祖宗”身子骨挺结实；因为心里牵挂那四十亩地，也拄个拐杖跟着去了。
