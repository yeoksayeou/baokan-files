　　[Ping City News] On the eve of the opening of the All-China Federation of Literary and Art Workers Representative Congress, Mr. Guo Moruo, Director of the Preparatory Committee, delivered a brief speech, stating: "This congress is being convened in the great period when the People's Liberation Army is about to achieve a complete victory. For Chinese literary and art workers, this is an unprecedented grand meeting of historical significance. The Preparatory Committee has decided to invite a total of 753 representatives; including 445 representatives from the old liberated areas (347 of whom have arrived in Ping), and 308 representatives from the newly liberated areas and areas awaiting liberation (213 of whom have arrived in Ping). These representatives include representatives from all fields of literary and art workers who oppose imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism. In the past, these literary and art workers were separated by the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang into two fundamentally different regions, each carrying out their work. The vast majority have experienced arduous struggles and tests, and have achieved considerable results; moreover, in recent years, the literary and art workers in the old liberated areas have created many examples under Chairman Mao's literary and art guidelines, and on the basis of integrating with the workers, peasants, and soldiers. Now, we are converging in Beiping. The complete elimination of the remaining forces of the Kuomintang reactionaries is not far off, and a new period of the Chinese revolution, with construction as its main task, has already begun. In such an exciting and inspiring period, representatives from different regions, different work departments, and different artistic styles from across the country are gathering together to hold this unprecedentedly grand and unprecedentedly united congress. The main purpose is to summarize our mutual experiences, exchange our mutual opinions, accept our mutual criticisms, and encourage our mutual learning, in order to jointly determine the future direction and tasks of national literary and art work, and to establish a new national organization. We believe that this congress will surely be able to successfully complete these tasks, and that under the clear guidance of Chairman Mao, literary and art workers throughout the country will not only unite themselves, but also unite the people; not only educate themselves, but also educate the people; and must make good use of the weapon of literature and art to enhance revolutionary hatred of the enemy and encourage production enthusiasm, in order to quickly complete the tasks of anti-imperialism, anti-feudalism, and anti-bureaucratic capitalism, and to achieve a complete victory in the construction of the new democratic culture."

　　文代大会开幕前夕
  　郭沫若先生发表谈话
  　说明大会的主要目的与任务
    【平市讯】中华全国文学艺术工作者代表大会筹委会主任郭沫若先生，于大会开幕前夕，发表简要谈话称：“这次大会在人民解放军即将获得全面胜利的伟大时期中召开，这在中国文学艺术工作者，是富有历史意义的空前盛大的会议。筹备委员会已决定邀请的代表共有七五三人；计老解放区代表四四五人（已抵平者三四七人），新解放区与待解放区代表三零八人（已抵平者二一三人）。这些代表中，包括了反对帝国主义，反对封建主义，反对官僚资本主义的文学艺术工作者各方面的代表人物。在过去，这些文学艺术工作者被国民党反动统治分隔在两个根本不同的地区里，各自进行工作，绝大多数都经历了坚苦的斗争和考验，都有着相当的成绩；而老解放区的文学艺术工作者，近几年来更在毛主席的文艺方针下，在和工农兵群众相结合的基础上创造了许多范例。现在，我们是会师北平了。国民党反动派残余力量的全部肃清已为期不远，以建设为主要任务的中国革命的新时期业已开始。在这样一个令人兴奋鼓舞的时期，全国不同地区，不同工作部门，不同艺术作风的代表们聚集一堂，举行这一个空前盛大与空前团结的大会，主要的目的便是要总结我们彼此的经验，交换我们彼此的意见，接受我们彼此的批评，砥砺我们彼此的学习，以共同确定今后全国文艺工作的方针与任务，成立一个新的全国性的组织，我们相信这个大会一定能够胜利完成这些任务，而且全国文学艺术工作者们一定会在毛主席的明确指导之下，不仅要团结自己，还要团结人民，不仅要教育自己，还要教育人民，要好好地运用文艺这项武器来提高革命敌忾，鼓励生产热情，以期迅速完成反帝反封建反官僚资本的任务，而使新民主主义文化建设获得全面胜利。”
