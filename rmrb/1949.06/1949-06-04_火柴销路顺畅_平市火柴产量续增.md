  　Ping City Match Production Continues to Increase
    [Report from this newspaper] The private match industry in Ping City is thriving. May saw another increase in production, with a total of 1,603 boxes produced by seven factories, an increase of 95 boxes compared to April, and 403 boxes compared to March. Among them, Danhua Match Factory only produced 10 boxes per day when it resumed work on March 1st, but now it can produce 34 boxes per day. The Housheng Match Factory has also increased from 10 boxes to 24 boxes per day. Sanyang Match Factory increased by 36 boxes in May compared to April. Thanks to the strong support of the Trade Corporation for the match industry, supplying raw materials and purchasing finished products, and also because of the increasingly convenient transportation from Ping City to various places, sales are very smooth. Match factories in this city have increased. The Huaxing Match Factory, which was destroyed by fire, has resumed work. The newly opened Xinhua, Dazhong, and Tiancheng match factories have either started work or are actively preparing, among which Xinhua Match Factory started production on May 20th. The factory has one match stick arranging machine and 13 workers. In May, it worked for nine days and produced a total of 13 boxes of safety matches. Because the match industry has a very promising future, many people are preparing to invest in this industry.
