　　A Brief History of the National Railway Federation of Trade Unions
　　The National Railway Federation of Trade Unions is one of the earliest national industrial trade unions established in China. During the Kailuan Five Mines strike in October 1922, representatives of railway workers from across the country gathered in Beiping, and in addition to discussing aid for the Kailuan miners, they established a preparatory committee for the National Railway Federation of Trade Unions. After the establishment of the preparatory committee, it originally intended to convene the inaugural meeting of the National Railway Federation of Trade Unions in March 1923, but unfortunately, the "February 7th" massacre occurred. Railway workers on the Beijing-Hankou Railway were brutally slaughtered by the Northern Warlords, and trade unions along the Beijing-Hankou Railway and other lines were destroyed and closed down. Many important activists of the preparatory committee and trade unions on various lines were persecuted. However, the preparatory committee and worker leaders on various lines persisted in their work under severe White Terror. Finally, on February 7, 1924, more than 20 worker representatives from the Beijing-Hankou, Beijing-Fengtian, Beijing-Suiyuan, Zhengtai, Yuehan, Jinpu, Zhuping, and Jiaoji Railways were convened in Beiping. They officially established the National Railway Federation of Trade Unions and issued the famous declaration of the founding of the National Railway Federation of Trade Unions. The declaration proposed demands such as improving the living conditions of railway workers, strengthening the unity of railway workers, raising worker consciousness, leading railway workers in various struggles, assisting workers on various lines in organizing trade unions, and establishing close ties with industrial workers and workers around the world. In May of the same year, the association was persecuted by reactionary warlords again, and more than 40 worker leaders on various lines were unreasonably arrested or dismissed and wanted. However, the association continued to lead the national railway workers in their heroic struggle and had a significant impact on the national railway workers and the national working class until it ceased its activities in 1936 due to various objective reasons.

　　全国铁路总工会简史
    中华全国铁路总工会是中国成立最早的全国性产业工会。在一九二二年十月间开滦五矿罢工时，全国铁路工会代表曾于北平集会，除计议援助开滦矿工外，并产生全国铁路总工会筹备委员会。筹委会成立后，本拟于一九二三年三月间召集全国铁路总工会成立大会，不幸“二七”惨案发生，京汉铁路工人惨遭北洋军阀屠杀，京汉路及各路工会多被捣毁封闭，筹委会及各路工会重要活动分子多遭迫害。但筹委会及各路工人领袖在严重的白色恐怖下仍坚持工作，卒于一九二四年二月七日在北平召集京汉、京奉、京绥、正太、粤汉、津浦、株萍、胶济等路工人代表二十余人，通过正式成立全国铁路总工会，发表了著名的全国铁路总工会成立宣言。宣言中提出要求改善铁路工人生活，加强铁路工人团结，提高工人觉悟，领导铁路工人进行各种斗争，帮助各路工人组织各路总工会，并与全国各产业工人和世界工人建立密切联系等主张。同年五月该会又遭反动军阀迫害，各路工人领袖先后被无理拘捕或开除、通缉者达四十余人，但该会仍不屈不挠地领导全国铁路工人进行英勇的斗争，在全国铁路工人以及全国工人阶级中有重大的影响，直至一九三六年才因各种客观原因停止活动。（新华社北平十一日电）
