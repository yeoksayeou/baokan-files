　　Telegram from Railway Workers in the Pingjin Area
  　Supporting the Restoration of the National Railway Union
    [Ping City News] The Preparatory Committee of the Railway Workers' General Union in the Pingjin Area recently sent a telegram supporting the decision of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions to restore the National Railway Union. The original telegram stated: "As the country is about to be liberated and the railways are about to belong entirely to the people, the All-China Federation of Trade Unions has decided to convene a National Railway Workers' Representative Conference to prepare for the restoration of the National Railway Union and to establish our own leadership organization for railway employees to better unite and advance. In the future, we will regularly receive work instructions, enabling us to continuously improve our work and successfully complete the tasks assigned by the Military Commission's Ministry of Railways to support the war and build the people's railways. We are extremely excited and feel infinite honor and joy!"
    We, the railway workers in the Pingjin area, have steadfastly stepped onto the stage of political struggle since "February 7th" – the day we engaged in a bloody struggle with the feudal warlord Wu Peifu to establish a railway workers' organization. We have demonstrated the great proletarian determination and tenacious fighting spirit. For more than 20 years, under the correct leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, we have achieved brilliant victories. We must inherit the glorious tradition of the past and strive to build the people's railways. We fully support the decision of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions to restore the National Railway Union and agree with the suggestions of the Northeast Federation of Trade Unions. We have already sent out telegrams to elect representatives according to the instructions of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions. We wish this conference complete victory and success!
