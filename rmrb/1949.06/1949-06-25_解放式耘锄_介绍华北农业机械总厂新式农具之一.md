    The Liberation-Style Weeder-Hoe
    --Introducing a New Type of Farm Implement from the North China Agricultural Machinery General Factory
    Jiang Hongbin, North China Agricultural Machinery General Factory
    Inter-tillage (i.e., hoeing) is a complicated task. As the saying goes, "precise plowing and fine hoeing" describes the meticulousness of this work. The tools for inter-tillage are generally old-fashioned hoes. Even the most diligent farmers can only hoe one or two mu of land per day. Ordinary crops such as corn need to be hoed three times a season, and cotton needs to be hoed five times. Calculating this way, farmers spend thirty to forty days a year on inter-tillage.
    The commonly used animal-powered inter-tillage tools in rural North China are weeder-hoes or *huo zi*. Their structure is very simple. The body and shaft are made of wood, with two or three iron crescent shovels at the bottom. They are pulled by one animal, and the user holds two wooden handles behind to control them left and right. They can hoe more than ten mu of land per day, but the disadvantage is that they are not strong, the distance between each shovel is fixed, and the depth depends entirely on the operator's control. They cannot be used uniformly for different crops.
    The North China Agricultural Machinery General Factory has specially produced the Liberation-Style Weeder-Hoe (as shown in the picture) to meet the needs of farmers. It was one of the agricultural machines displayed at the Beiping Industrial Exhibition that attracted more attention from the audience. It was originally named "Three-Tooth Inter-tiller." According to reports from various farms that have tested its use and the opinions of farmers in various places, its effectiveness is better than all current animal-powered inter-tillage tools.
    The name "Three-Tooth Inter-tiller" is not very appropriate because it has several sets of different shapes of shovels and knife holders, which can have different arrangements of one tooth, two teeth, three teeth, and five teeth. In order to commemorate the liberation of all of North China, we named it the "Liberation-Style Weeder-Hoe."
    The Liberation-Style Weeder-Hoe is designed and manufactured with reference to the latest Soviet-style and the general row spacing and soil conditions of North China crops after experimental research. It combines the various advantages of the five-tooth inter-tiller and is equipped with a complete set of different forms of shovels. The depth can be freely adjusted from one inch to four inches, and the width can be adjusted to suit the needs. You only need to use a wrench to change the distance of the shovels. It can achieve certain purposes through weeding, loosening soil, plowing, ditching, and hilling, and also by changing the shovels in a staggered arrangement. The daily hoeing efficiency can reach 20 mu, which saves a lot of labor compared with using a hoe, and avoids delaying farming and leaving land uncultivated.
    As far as we know, the Liberation-Style Weeder-Hoe is currently better than other animal-powered inter-tillage tools, but there is room for improvement, such as the hoeing width is not wide enough, and the handles can be changed to wood to reduce weight and cost, etc.
    The North China Agricultural Machinery General Factory has now produced several Liberation-Style Weeder-Hoes. Thirty-one will be produced by the end of June. In addition to our own testing, Shijiazhuang Farm, Nanyuan Farm, and Shuangqiao Farm are also testing its performance separately. We welcome various farms and farmers to assist in this experiment and provide specific opinions. We will summarize these experiences, strive to improve them, and prepare to mass-produce them for use in the vast rural areas.
    The cost of manufacturing the first, second, and third batches of Liberation-Style Weeder-Hoes was quite high. In addition to our factory subjectively saving labor and materials, improving work efficiency, and trying to reduce costs, if we can get collective orders from rural cooperatives and mutual aid groups, the prospect of promoting the Liberation-Style Weeder-Hoe in rural areas in conjunction with other agricultural machinery is promising.

    解放式耘锄
    ——介绍华北农业机械总厂新式农具之一
    华北农业机械总厂  蒋弘彬
    中耕（即锄地）是一个繁杂的工作，俗语说：“精耕细锄”就是形容这种工作的细致。中耕的工具，一般都是用旧式的锄，最勤快的农人每天只能锄一二亩地，普通作物如玉米一季得锄三次，棉花得锄五次，这样计算起来，一年农民要有三、四十天花在中耕的工作上。
    华北农村普通常用的畜力中耕器是耘锄或劐子，构造很简单，器身和辕杆都是木质的，底部有铁质的月牙铲子两个或三个，用牲口一头曳拉，后面有两个木把，使用者手扶木把在后面左右操纵，每天可锄地十多亩，但缺点是不坚固，各个铲子的距离是死的，深浅也全靠操纵者去掌握，对不同的作物不能一律使用。
    华北农业机械总厂为适合农民需要，特制出解放式耘锄（如图）、它是在北平工业展览会上陈列的各种农业机械中比较使观众注目的一部，原名“三齿中耕器”，据各农场试验使用的报告以及各地农民的意见，它的效能比一切现在的畜力中耕器都好。
    “三齿中耕器”这个名字是不甚合适，因它具备好几组不同形状的铲刀和刀架，可以有单齿、双齿、三齿、五齿不同的排列。我们为了纪念全华北的解放，取名为“解放式耘锄”。
    解放式耘锄是参考苏联最新创行的式样和华北农作物的一般行间距离土壤情况经过试验研究而设计制造的，它兼有五齿中耕器的各种优点，附有成套的不同形式的铲刀，深度由一寸至四寸，可以自由调节，宽窄却能适用，只要用螺丝板子去变换铲刀的距离就行，除草，松土、翻土、开沟、培土，也可以用变换铲刀错杂排列的方法来达到一定的目的。每天的锄地效率可达二十亩，较用锄头，节省很大劳力，而且不致误时荒地。
    据我们所知：解放式耘锄在目前比别的畜力中耕器都好，但可以改进的地方不是没有，比如锄地的幅宽还不够，手柄可以改成木质以减轻重量和成本等等。
    现在华北农业机械总厂已制成解放式耘锄数部，六月底可制出三十一部，除了自己在试验外，石家庄农场南苑农场，双桥农场均已分别在试验它的性能，我们欢迎各农场，各农民同志协助做这个试验，并具体的提些意见，我们将总结这些经验，努力加以改进，准备大量制造献给广大农村使用。
    我们制造第一、二、三批解放式耘锄时成本颇高。除了我们工厂主观上用省工省料提高工作效率，尽量压低成本外，如能得到农村的合作社和互助组的集体订购，解放式耘锄配合其他农业机械在农村推广的前途是有希望的。(附图片）
