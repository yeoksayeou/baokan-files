　　North China Water Conservancy Promotion Agency Loans and Sells 2,000 Water Carts
    [Report from this newspaper] In order to support the development of water conservancy, the North China Water Conservancy Promotion Agency has loaned and sold a total of 2,071 water carts of both piped and wrought iron types in April, May, and June. Among them, 152 were loaned to districts 6, 7, and 8 of Shijiazhuang City. Other borrowers and purchasers include more than ten counties in areas such as southern Hebei and central Hebei. The North China Water Conservancy Promotion Agency recently convened a joint conference of cadres in charge of water loan work, deciding to collect the outstanding portion of previously loaned water carts in grain. The standard for converting grain is set at one jin of wheat equivalent to one jin and two liang of millet. Those who are overdue will be calculated at one jin of wheat equivalent to one jin of millet. Cadres responsible for collection in various regions should conduct in-depth publicity and explanation to the masses in advance, so that the masses can recognize the benefits of water loans and voluntarily hand over good wheat.
    In order to continue lending water carts, the conference decided to lend while collecting. In addition, to meet the supply of water cart parts, the North China Water Conservancy Promotion Agency is preparing to supply water cart buckets in large quantities (available in both single-layer and double-layer types), which will be purchased uniformly by each county.　　　　　　　　(Wang Rui)

　　华北水利推进社贷售水车两千辆
    【本报讯】为了扶植发展水利，华北水利推进社在四、五、六月份中，共贷和售出管子的和熟铁的两种水车共二千零七十一辆，其中石家庄市六、七、八区即贷出一百五十二辆，其他借贷与购买者计有冀南、冀中等地区十余县。华北水利推进社最近召集水贷工作的干部联席会议，决定以前贷出的水车贷粮收回应收部分，收粮折合标准，确定为一斤小麦折合小米一斤二两，过期迟交者按小麦一斤折小米一斤计算。各地负责催收的干部，事先向群众进行深入宣传解释，使群众认识水贷的好处，自动交好麦子。
    为了继续贷出水车，会议决定，一面收一面贷。另外为满足水车零件的供给，华北水利推进社准备大批供给水车斗子（有单皮、双皮两种），由各县负责统一代购。　　　　　　　　（王瑞）
