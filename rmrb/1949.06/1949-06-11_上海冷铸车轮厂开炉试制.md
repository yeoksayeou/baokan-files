Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 10th: The Shanghai Cold-Cast Wheel Factory, which had been shut down for five months, resumed production on the 4th of this month. On that day, the first batch of cold-cast wheels was produced, totaling fifteen wheels for 30-ton trucks. After rigorous inspection, eight of them met the standards. The technology has greatly improved compared to the trial production in October last year, when only seven out of forty-four cold-cast wheels met the standards. Cold-cast wheels are giant wheels used for railways, and their manufacturing requires relatively advanced casting technology. In the past, only Shenyang and Dalian had cold-cast wheel factories in the country. The Shanghai factory began preparations in July last year and trial-produced cold-cast wheels in October. By the end of December, it was forced to shut down due to poor management by Kuomintang bureaucratic-capital enterprises. Only ninety-four cold-cast wheels were produced during that time. After the liberation of Shanghai, the factory was taken over by the Military Control Commission, and preparations for resuming work were quickly made. The workers were in high spirits, and many employees voluntarily went to the factory to work after dinner. The factory director, Xu Dexin, also expressed his "willingness to devote his life's efforts to serve the people." The factory is now drafting a production increase plan to meet the needs of railway transportation.

　　上海冷铸车轮厂
  　开炉试制
    【新华社上海十日电】停工已达五月的上海冷铸车轮厂已于本月四日开炉。是日开炉试制冷铸车轮，第一炉即制出载重三十公吨的车轮十五个。经过严格的检验，合乎标准者有八个。较该厂去年十月试制时，技术已大有进步。当时试制的四十四个冷铸车轮只有七个合乎标准。冷铸车轮为铁路用的巨型车轮，此种车轮的制造需要较高级的冶铸技术。全国冷铸车轮厂过去仅有沈阳与大连两处。上海厂是于去年七月开始筹备，十月试制冷铸车轮，至十二月底即因国民党官僚资本企业机构经营不善而被迫停工。前后仅出冷铸车轮九十四个。上海解放后，该厂为军管会接管，迅即筹划复工。工人们情绪很高，许多职工吃过晚饭自动到工厂工作。该厂厂长徐德新亦表示“愿尽自己毕生的努力，为人民服务”。现该厂正拟订增产计划，以供铁路运输的需要。
