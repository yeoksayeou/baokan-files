　　Talking about the Cooperatives in Laishui
　　Today, this newspaper published a report that 36 out of 88 cooperatives in Laishui collapsed within half a year, and put forward three reasons for the collapse. This is a very serious phenomenon. As far as we know, many regions have similar situations, and the relevant parties should conduct in-depth investigations and research, and take effective measures to actively reorganize and transform the existing cooperatives.
　　In addition to the reasons for the collapse of Laishui cooperatives, which were due to too much credit and too small capital expenditure, according to those experienced in cooperative affairs, the more fundamental problem is that it is difficult for a single village cooperative to operate well. Because even if a single village has one or two thousand people, its consumption and sales of agricultural products are still very limited. If operated independently, it is difficult to gain a foothold in business; the cooperatives that can gain a foothold are by no means limited to their own village in their operations.
　　The larger the business of rural supply and marketing cooperatives, the better; the longer the legs, the farther it runs, the more beneficial it is. Such cooperatives are not easy to collapse and have the potential for development. Therefore, strong county supply and marketing cooperatives should be established to organize and lead the business of district and village cooperatives, and they must be connected with large cities to truly connect urban and rural relations in order to practically solve the problems of village cooperatives. There is absolutely no way out by just circling around in the village; if they don't collapse now, they will collapse in the future. Does Laishui have a county federation? We do not yet know. If so, what kind of relationship did it have with the above-mentioned village cooperatives in the past? What attitude did it take towards their collapse?
　　Secondly, the cooperative is a collective economic organization of the masses and must be operated as an economic undertaking. The Sanbeiyu Village Cooperative had 32.6 million border currency in funds, "that is, five cadres detached from production"; how could it not be eaten into bankruptcy!? If it were a private business of the cadres, they might not be willing to eat like this. If the cooperative is truly an economic organization of the masses and truly implements democracy, the masses will not allow it to be eaten like this. The problem is that these cooperatives still have a strong official flavor, and everything is controlled by the cadres. In 1945, the Nankan Cooperative gave Cao Ziming more than 800,000 yuan in sheep money on credit, and supplied Zhang Zhifa 9 shi and 5 dou (large shi) of grain to burn bricks, which is still owed to this day. Were these borrowed through the cadres, or borrowed through the masses?
　　In short, to run the cooperative well, it is necessary not only to diligently operate it as an economic undertaking, but also to follow the mass line, promote democracy, and truly "organize" the masses. Cooperatives will also collapse if they do not follow the mass line.
　　Regarding the reorganization of old cooperatives, there are many different opinions in various places. No matter what, there are indeed good cooperatives that are supported by the masses, but the phenomenon of continuous collapse or repeated reorganization and collapse is also very serious. It is hoped that various places will continue to summarize a unified experience in practice.

### 谈涞水的合作社

　　谈涞水的合作社
    今天本报发表涞水八十八个合作社在大半年之内，就垮了三十六个社的一个报导，并且提出了垮台的三个原因。这是十分严重的现象。据我们所知，许多地区都有类似情形，各有关方面应深入调查研究，并采取有效办法，积极整理改造现有的合作社。
    除去涞水所提出的由于赊帐太多和资本小开支太大而垮台的原因之外，据对合作事来有经验者谈，更基本的问题是：单独一个村合作社，事实上是很难经营得好的。因为单单一个村庄，即使有一两千人口，它的消费量和农产品的推销量都还有限得很。单独经营起来，在业务上很难站得住；能站得住的合作社，它所经营的业务绝不限于本村。
    农村供销合作社的业务愈大愈好办；腿愈长，跑的愈远，愈有利。这样的合作社不容易垮，而且有发展。因此应该建立强有力的县供销社来组织和领导区和村合作社的业务，而且要与大城市联系，真正沟通城乡关系，才能实际解决村合作社的问题。光在村子里面兜圈子绝无出路，现在不垮，将来也还会垮。涞水是否有县联社？我们还不知道，如有，过去对上述各村的合作社是一种什么关系？对于它们的垮台又是采取什么态度？
    其次，合作社是群众的集体经济组织，必须当经济事业来经营。三北峪村社有三千二百六十万边币资金，“即有脱离生产干部五人”；这如何能不吃垮！？如若是干部私人的生意，他们也许就不肯这样吃。如若合作社真正是群众的经济组织，真正实行了民主，群众也不会允许这样吃。问题是这类合作社还是官办的气味大，一切由干部把持。南坎合作社一九四五年赊给曹子明八十多万元羊钱，供给张治发九石五斗（大石）粮去烧瓦窑，拖欠至今不还。这都是通过干部借的，还是通过群众借的呢？
    总之，要将合作社办好，不但要兢兢业业拿它当经济事业来经营，而且必须要走群众路线，发扬民主，真正将群众“组织起来”。合作社不走群众路线也一定会垮台。
    关于旧有合作社的整理问题，各地多有不同的意见，不管如何，好的为群众所拥护的合作社固然也有，但一直垮台或屡整屡垮的现象确也很严重，望各地在实践中继续总结一个统一的经验出来。
