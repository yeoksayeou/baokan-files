　　【Chahar News】Since this spring, serious mountain fire incidents have been occurring continuously in the Pingxi mountain area. According to inspection reports from Laiishui, Wanping, and Fangshan counties: from March 27th to May 6th, over a period of forty days, a total of eighteen mountain fires occurred, including: nine in Wanping, four in Laishui, and five in Fangshan, burning an area of more than 135 *li* and hundreds of *mu*. More than 100,000 trees of all sizes were burned. The causes of the fires were as follows: nine were caused by burning terraced fields, two by smoking, two by using smoke for fertilization, one by children playing with fire, one by shepherds intentionally setting fire to burn off dead grass and insect eggs to grow better grass for grazing, and one by using fire to bake dry food in the fields (the causes of two others are still unclear). The most serious incidents were: one, Zheng Xiyou of Daoshuiquan Village, Laishui County, started a fire while burning terraced fields, burning 40 *li* of area near the Wenwugou area, destroying more than 100,000 timber trees; the number of non-timber trees was incalculable. Two, Liu Fushou of Jilu Village started a fire while burning terraced fields, burning 20 *li* of the northern mountains of the village. Three, a fire started on Shangfang Mountain in the fifth district of Fangshan, burning several *qing* of area and destroying more than 2,000 trees (the person who set the fire and the cause are still unclear). After the mountain fire incidents occurred in each county (except for the two cases of Shangfang Mountain and Dacaoling in Fangshan), they have been dealt with; in minor cases, in addition to requiring the perpetrators to confess their mistakes at mass meetings, they were also required to replant new trees according to the number of trees destroyed. For example, Wang Zhaoxian (a military dependent) of Fangyang Village, Seventh District of Wanping, started a fire while burning terraced fields, burning five *li* of mountain area and destroying ten trees. In addition to admitting his mistake at a mass meeting, he planted fifty trees. Those who caused serious mountain fires, such as the arsonists in Daoshuiquan, Laishui, were handed over to the government for sentencing to imprisonment.
    Why do mountain fire incidents occur frequently?
    The main reason is that leaders at all levels do not attach enough importance to the work of prohibiting mountain access and protecting forests. They have not seriously and extensively publicized the policies on prohibiting mountain access and protecting forests to the masses. At the same time, the handling of mountain fire incidents has not been timely enough, which has fueled the occurrence of mountain fire incidents. Secondly, there has not been enough investigation into the arson of a small number of saboteurs.
    In order to do a good job in prohibiting mountain access, protecting forests, and afforestation, and to eliminate mountain fire incidents, it is necessary to: (1) conduct extensive and in-depth propaganda to make the masses understand the policies on prohibiting mountain access and protecting forests, the reward measures for planting trees and afforestation, and the importance of these to the long-term interests of all the people, and to establish a long-term concept of afforestation and forest protection. (2) Those individual lawbreakers who set fire to mountains and cut down trees indiscriminately should be severely punished. Those who have contributed to forest protection should also be commended in a timely manner. (3) Strengthen the forest protection organization. Seize a certain amount of time to issue forest certificates to determine forest rights. (4) Use slack farming periods to convene meetings of forest protection committee members, cattle and sheep herders, and livestock owners to conduct education on forest and grazing policies and to establish jointly observed forest protection covenants. (5) Branch party members should strengthen their leadership in forest protection and afforestation.
    【Another News】In order to reiterate the policy of prohibiting mountain access and protecting forests, the Pingxi Administrative Office issued another proclamation on prohibiting mountain access and protecting forests on May 31st, pointing out that disasters such as water, drought, wind, and hail are the greatest harms to agricultural production, and the basic reason lies in the lack of forests and excessive sand and gravel. Only by prohibiting mountain reclamation and extensively afforesting can we regulate rainfall and reduce natural disasters. For this reason, it is specifically stipulated that: (1) From now on, anyone who sets fire to the mountains, no matter who it is, whether intentional or unintentional, will be investigated and sent to the government for legal action. If mountain fires are discovered, the masses should be quickly organized to extinguish them. Those who see a fire and do not help save it, or do not report a mountain fire, will be held accountable by the government and severely punished. (2) All mountain land that has been reclaimed and can be operated for a long time must be cultivated into terraced fields and meticulously cultivated. Those that can only be cultivated temporarily should immediately plant trees and gradually convert them into forest areas. (3) It is strictly forbidden to cut down trees indiscriminately. Before they are mature, sparse trees may only have their branches cut in season, and dense trees may only be thinned according to plan. After the trees have matured, felling must be approved by the government before felling, and replanting must be carried out on the spot after felling. (4) It is strictly forbidden to set fire to mountains and destroy forests. Violators will be severely punished in addition to being ordered to replant and replant. (5) All prohibited mountains and prohibited forests must not be cut down or grazed. Opening methods must be stipulated according to the size of the forest area. Illegal destruction must be compensated or given appropriate punishment.

### 保护林木严防烧山　平西发布禁山护林办法

　　保护林木严防烧山　平西发布禁山护林办法
    【察哈尔讯】今春以来，平西山地不断发生严重烧山事件，据涞水、宛平、房山三县检查报告：从三月二十七日至五月六日四十多天时间，共烧山十八起，计：宛平九起、涞水四起、房山五起，燃烧面积一百三十五里又数百亩之多。烧毁大小树木十余万棵。燃火原因有这样几种：因烧地阶子引火的九起，抽烟引火二起，熏肥引火二起，小孩玩火引烧一起，牧羊的有意放火烧掉枯草及虫卵以便长好青草放羊的一起，上地烤干粮而引火的一起，（尚有二起未弄清原因）。其中最严重的，一是涞水道水泉村郑喜友烧地阶子失火，将文武沟附近之山烧毁四十里大的面积，烧毁材树十余万棵，不成材的无法统计。二是计鹿村刘福寿烧地阶失火，将该村北山烧毁二十里大的面积。三是房山五区上方山起火，烧有数顷大的面积，毁树二千余棵（何人放火引火原因尚未弄清）。各县烧山事件发生后（除房山上方山大草岭二件外）均已进行处理；轻的除令其在群众大会坦白承认错误外，并按毁树棵数补种了新树。例如宛平七区房杨村王兆贤（军属）烧地阶引火烧山五里，烧毁树十棵，除大会承认错误外种树五十棵。烧山严重者如涞水道水泉等烧山人犯，押政府判处徒刑。
    为什么经常发生烧山事件呢？
    其主要原因是各级领导思想上对禁山护林工作高度重视不够，没有十分认真的把禁山护林政策广泛的宣传到群众中去，同时对烧山事件处理不够及时，助长了烧山事件的发生。其次是对少数破坏分子的烧山行为查究不够。
    为了搞好禁山护林及造林工作，根绝烧山事件，今后必须：（一）广泛深入的宣传使群众都懂得禁山护林政策植树造林奖励办法及其对全体人民长远利益的重要意义，树立长期的造林护林思想。（二）个别不法之徒烧山滥砍树木者应予从严惩处。对护林有功者亦应及时表扬。（三）把护林组织健全起来。抓紧一定时间发放林木证确定林权。（四）利用农隙召开护林委员、牛羊倌畜主会议，贯彻林牧政策的教育，订立共同遵守的护林公约。（五）支部党员加强对护林造林的领导。
    【又讯】为重申禁山护林政策，平西专署于五月三十一日再颁禁山护林布告，指出：水、旱、风、雹等灾为农业生产之最大危害，基本原因在于林木过少，砂石过多，只有禁山开荒、广泛造林，才能调节雨量减少天灾。为此特规定：（一）今后凡有放火烧山者，不论何人不论有意或无意，查出送政府法办，如发现有烧山情事应迅速组织群众扑灭，如见火不救，烧山不报者，政府必究严加惩处。（二）凡已开垦之山地，可以长期经营者，均须修成梯田精耕细做，只能暂时耕种者，应即加种树木逐渐改为林区。（三）严禁滥伐树木，在未成材以前，稀者只许以时柯枝，密者只许按计划间伐，树已成材之后，伐前须由政府批准，砍后须就原地补栽。（四）严禁放火烧山，破坏林木，违者除令其补栽补种外，并严加处分。（五）一切禁山禁林不得砍伐放牧，须按林区大小，规定开放办法，违法破坏必令补偿或予适当处分。
