Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 28th: Shang Lei, Gao Guangzuo, Zhang Bingkui, Cao Zhuyan, Chen Qichuan, Zhang Bingzhong, Liu Yuzhu, and other seventy-three officers and men from the former Kuomintang warship Lingfu, arrived in Shenyang via Tianjin in three batches from Hong Kong this month to join the People's Liberation Army Navy. The Northeast Military Region Command and Political Department of the People's Liberation Army hosted banquets to welcome them. Shang Lei and others were greatly excited by witnessing the good revolutionary order and the thriving construction work in the liberated areas, and expressed their determination to study hard and wholeheartedly serve the construction of the people's navy. They left the Kuomintang navy after the Lingfu warship was taken back by the British government. The Lingfu was an escort destroyer, and like the cruiser Chongqing, which revolted on February 25, they were originally British warships. The Chongqing was given to the Kuomintang reactionary government by British imperialism, while the Lingfu was nominally "leased." The ship had about 150 personnel, and most of the lower-ranking officers and soldiers were deeply dissatisfied with the Kuomintang bandit gang's traitorous civil war behavior and corrupt practices, so more than 30 people left one after another. After the Chongqing warship's uprising, the Kuomintang reactionaries, fearing that the Lingfu warship would follow suit, colluded with British imperialism, and the British destroyer HMS Comus escorted the ship from Shanghai to Guangzhou. Later, on April 20, the ship was transferred from Guangzhou to Hong Kong and impounded, and on May 27, the British government came forward and took the ship back. The Kuomintang reactionary government then forced the ship's personnel to go to Taiwan. The officers and soldiers on the ship, including Shang Lei, were unwilling to continue serving as tools for the Kuomintang bandit gang's anti-people civil war, and secretly came to the liberated areas from Hong Kong one after another.

　　前国民党军舰灵甫号官兵
  　七十三人参加我海军
    发表宣言决心为人民海军服务
    【新华社沈阳二十八日电】前国民党军舰灵甫号官兵尚镭、高光祚、张炳奎、曹助雁、陈淇川、张炳中、刘裕铸等七十三人，于本月间从香港分三批北上，经天津到达沈阳，参加人民解放军海军。人民解放军东北军区司令部、政治部先后设宴欢迎。尚镭等目睹解放区良好的革命秩序及各种建设工作欣欣向荣的景象，至感兴奋，纷纷表示要努力学习，全心全意为建设人民的海军服务。他们是在灵甫号军舰被英国政府收回后脱离国民党海军的。灵甫号为护航驱逐舰，与二月二十五日起义的巡洋舰重庆号原来都是英国军舰，重庆号是英帝国主义赠与国民党反动政府的，而灵甫号则名义上是“租借”的。该舰舰上人员约一百五十名，下级官兵大部对国民党匪帮之卖国内战行为及贪污腐化作风深感不满，因此先后离开者约有三十余人。重庆号军舰起义后，国民党反动派深恐灵甫号军舰跟着起义，乃与英帝国主义勾结，由英驱逐舰康巴斯号将该舰自上海押驶广州。以后，又于四月二十日将该舰自广州调往香港扣押，并于五月二十七日由英国政府出面将该舰收回。国民党反动政府又强令舰上人员至台湾，舰上官兵尚镭等不愿继续充当国民党匪帮反人民内战的工具，乃先后秘密自香港来解放区。
