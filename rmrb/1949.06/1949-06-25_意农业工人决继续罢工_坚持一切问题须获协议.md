Xinhua News Agency, Peiping, June 24th: Tass, Rome: The Federation of Agricultural Workers and the Farm Laborers' Union of the Po Valley recently held a representative meeting in Bologna to discuss the situation of the Italian agricultural workers' strike and decided to continue the strike. In response to the landowners' refusal to negotiate with union representatives, the meeting declared that rural workers would refuse to harvest grain unless all outstanding issues could be agreed upon. The meeting sent a letter to the Speaker of the House of Deputies, Gronchi, requesting that Parliament order an investigation into the authorities' and landowners' violations of the right to strike and basic freedoms granted to all citizens by the Constitution. After the meeting, Bossi, the secretary of the Agricultural Workers' Federation, stated to the press: "The completely illegal actions taken by landowners and the police everywhere are the most shocking factors in the current situation. Only due to the profound sense of responsibility of the farm laborers has the conflict in various places been prevented from developing into a civil war. Our trade union struggle has never encountered so many instances of the police using force. Agricultural workers are fully determined to continue the struggle until their legitimate demands are recognized and the illegal actions of the landowners are ended." The Secretary-General of the General Confederation of Labor, Vittorio, met with the Speaker of the House of Deputies, Gronchi, requesting that Parliament take measures to resolve the conflict between farm laborers and landowners.

    意农业工人决继续罢工
    坚持一切问题须获协议
    【新华社北平二十四日电】塔斯社罗马讯：波河流域农业工人联合会和农场雇工联盟，最近在波仑亚召开代表会议，讨论了意大利农业工人罢工的情况，并决定继续罢工。为了答复地主的拒绝与工会代表进行谈判，会议宣称，除非一切未决问题能获得协议，农村工人将拒绝收割谷物。会议致函下院议长格朗基，要求国会下令调查当局和地主侵犯宪法赋予全体公民的罢工权及基本自由的行为。农业工人联合会书记博西于会后向报界声明说：“地主和警察到处进行的完全违法的行为，是目前形势中最惊人的因素。只是由于农场雇工们的深刻的责任感，各地的冲突才得以免于发展成为内战。我国工会斗争还从来没有碰到过这样多次警察使用武力的情形。农业工人有充分决心继续进行斗争，一直到他们的正当要求得到承认，并且结束地主们的不法行动为止。”总工会总书记维特里奥往见下院议长格朗基，要求国会采取措施解决农场雇工与地主间的冲突。
