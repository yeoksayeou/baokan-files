The Past and Present of Mongol-Han Trade
By Our Correspondent Lü Guangming

At present, Mongol-Han trade is not as prosperous as it was before the War of Resistance, but its internal factors have undergone a fundamental change. That is, it has broken away from the traditional feudal monopoly of princes and nobles in history, and freed itself from the fetters of Chinese bureaucratic capital and imperialist economy. Under the unified leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, the people of the Mongol and Han regions have already begun a new trading relationship (mainly referring to state-owned trade), that is, a true free and independent, equal and mutually beneficial exchange of goods to jointly develop and prosper the economies of both regions. Although the current transaction volume is not very large, it has embarked on a promising path.

Zhangjiakou City is a distribution center for the fur and livestock industry in North China. Before the War of Resistance, almost all industries dealing with Mongolia gathered here. The period from 1925 to 1929 was the heyday of Mongol-Han trade. There were more than a thousand merchants in Zhangjiakou engaged in trade with Mongolia, including about three hundred larger businesses. These merchants mostly went in the spring and returned in the autumn, or went in the autumn and returned the following spring. Exports were mainly silk, twill cloth, raw tobacco, brick tea, Mongolian boots, and leather saddles, followed by sugar, wine, and miscellaneous goods. According to past materials, the annual export volume of tea, tobacco, and cloth alone reached 200,000 boxes of brick tea, 30,000 baskets of packaged tea, 50,000 tons of raw tobacco, and 800,000 bolts of silk and cloth. The trade routes were divided into Inner and Outer Mongolia routes, one to Outer Mongolia's Kulun and Kyakhta, and the other to various places under the jurisdiction of the Xilin Gol and Chahar Leagues in Inner Mongolia (a total distance of 3,600 li). When returning in the autumn, because the grasslands in the north were lush with water and grass, and the livestock were strong and fat, it was convenient to transport them, so they mostly exchanged them for herds of cattle, sheep, and horses. When returning in the spring, because the quality of fur was good in winter, and it was suitable for the production season of the fur manufacturing industry, they mostly exchanged them for fur, horsehair, and *Cistanche deserticola*, mushrooms, and medicinal materials (Antelope horn, deer antlers, musk), etc. At that time, there were more than 20,000 ox carts and more than 6,000 camels traveling back and forth. The furs brought back were piled up outside Dajingmen in Zhangjiakou, "stretching for ten *li*, piled up like mountains." The annual import of various animal and livestock skins alone reached more than 8 million pieces, more than 10 million catties of wool and down, 1 million catties each of *Cistanche deserticola* and mushrooms, and also a large number of cattle, horses and sheep. Therefore, the fur industry is one of the links serving production and driving Zhangjiakou's trade. There are as many as fourteen types of industries serving Mongol-Han trade, such as operation and leather making. About 70 percent of the imported sheepskins were tanned and sewn into fur coats and mattresses in Zhangjiakou and Xuanhua, and sold to North China, Northeast China, Shanghai, Nanjing and other places, and some were exported. Sixty percent of raw fox skins were shipped to countries such as Britain and Germany. Another 40 percent were processed and tanned in Zhangjiakou and sold to major cities in our country. Eighty percent of wool and down was exported. *Cistanche deserticola* and mushrooms were sold to various provinces in South China.

Due to differences in geography, climate, production, and lifestyle, Mongol-Han trade has a strong seasonality. The herding of Mongolian people moves with the seasons (spring chasing water and grass to live at the foot of the slope, summer living in high places to prevent floods, autumn grazing relying on water conservancy, and winter living in depressions to prevent strong winds). As the only medium and bridge for Mongol-Han trade, merchants trading with Mongolia also do mobile business with the movement of Mongolian people. Because the economic production of Mongolian people is backward and transportation is underdeveloped, and because Mongolian people do not have the habit of traveling far away, they do not understand the market conditions for foreign goods, which leads to unequal exchange in the form of scissors differentials with high industrial products and low pastoral products. Exchanges are barter, sometimes using silver coins. As a result, merchants take advantage of these characteristics to make huge profits (the intermediate exploitation is very serious). It is said that merchants can buy a jade cigarette holder from Peiping for two yuan and exchange it for a large horse.

Between 1929 and 1930, Mongol-Han trade underwent a huge change. The reason for the change was that the Kuomintang, warlords, and their bureaucratic capital consistently discriminated against ethnic minorities in politics and economics. The People's Republic of Mongolia resolutely severed trade relations with the Kuomintang-controlled areas (Mongolia declared its independence in 1921). At that time, some Mongolian traitors and White Russian elements colluded with German imperialists and took the opportunity to organize a so-called "German-Chinese Foreign Firm," which once monopolized trade with Mongolia, but was soon broken away. At this time, the merchants trading with Mongolia in Zhangjiakou could only maintain exchanges with Inner Mongolia, and the fur industry decreased by more than 60 percent compared with before.

After the July 7th Incident, in order to plunder a large amount of fur for military use, the Japanese invaders specially established predatory institutions such as "Daimon Company," "Mongolian Livelihood Association," and "East Mongolian Livestock Company," and established a licensing system. Coupled with the extortion of traitors and special agents and exorbitant taxes, the trade with Mongolia was almost completely paralyzed. After Japan's surrender, Chairman Yunze established the "Inner Mongolia Autonomous League" in Zhangjiakou, and then organized the Inner Mongolia Industrial Company. In the Mongolian areas, five branch companies, five sub-branch companies, and five manager groups were established to initially restore and communicate trade between the Mongol and Han regions. With the support of the democratic government, the number of private industries trading with Mongolia in Zhangjiakou increased from six to thirty-five. The number of industrial and commercial households in Zhangjiakou City also increased from 1,104 when Japan surrendered to 3,228. However, due to the collusion of the enemy, puppets, and stubborn elements, and the turbulent environment, it was difficult to fully communicate Mongol-Han trade for a while, but the living difficulties encountered by Mongolian people during the eight-year War of Resistance were basically resolved. Later, due to the Kuomintang's continued expansion of the anti-people war, it brought deeper and heavier disasters to the local Mongol and Han people than during the Japanese occupation. In the autumn of 1946, Zhangjiakou City and various counties in Chahar Province were successively occupied by the Kuomintang bandit army. In the past two years, under the looting of American imperialism and bureaucratic capital, only three industries trading with Mongolia remained in Zhangjiakou City. Other industrial and commercial households have also decreased by more than 25% compared with before our withdrawal.

At that time, the Inner Mongolia Party, government, army, and people, in addition to organizing local people to carry out the struggle against robbery in the border areas, the Inner Mongolia People's Liberation Army carried out bandit suppression and pacification of the people in the inland areas; and together with the Northeast and North China People's Liberation Army, successfully prevented the bandit army's invasion. In order to stop the invasion of American economic forces, the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Government implemented a tax policy to protect the economic life of the Mongolian people. In the past two years, due to the looting of the bandit army, merchants trading with Mongolia have been hesitant to move forward, and the trade links between Zhangjiakou, Dolun and Inner Mongolia have actually been interrupted. Because of the cut-off of grain sources in Chahar Province, the people of Xilin Gol League, with the support of state-owned commerce in Inner Mongolia and Northeast China, developed and improved the production of large-grained salt. Large-grained salt and fur were used to exchange for a large amount of food from the Northeast. Other daily necessities such as tea, tobacco, cloth, and boots were also mostly supplied by the Northeast Liberated Area. However, some areas of Inner Mongolia were harassed and looted by the bandit army, and the living conditions were still difficult.

In the past two years, land reform has been implemented in the agricultural areas of Inner Mongolia, and the policy of "free grazing, protecting and breeding livestock" has been implemented in the pastoral areas. The output of agricultural and animal husbandry products has increased, and the purchasing power of the people has gradually increased. Militarily, with the complete liberation of the Northeast and North China, the long-standing banditry in Inner Mongolia has been eliminated. Especially after the liberation of Zhangjiakou, the Mongol-Han trade route was immediately fully opened. In order to better develop Mongol-Han trade, in addition to taking over the original "Inner Mongolia Tea and Tobacco Company" in Zhangjiakou, the Inner Mongolia Trading Company established the "Ximeng Trade Administration Zhangjiakou Office" on February 1 this year. After the liberation of Zhangjiakou, the Chahar Provincial Trading Company also established professional Yumin Fur Company and Dolun Branch Company one after another. At present, under the call of the Party's "close unity between Mongol and Han nationalities, and common development," the state-owned trade organizations in North China and Inner Mongolia are conducting planned material exchanges at normal and fair prices in the market in order to regulate the exchange of goods and prosper the economies of the two regions. The current situation in the local area is that private trade with Mongolia is allowed to recover and develop, but it must be properly managed. The most important thing is that state-owned commerce should vigorously support and develop the Mongolian people's supply and marketing cooperative economy, so as to gradually reduce the excessive profit intermediate exploitation of merchants trading with Mongolia, and lay the foundation for the further development of state-owned economy and cooperative economy.

　　蒙汉贸易今昔
    本报记者  吕光明
    目前蒙汉贸易，虽不如抗战前那样繁盛，但其内在因素上，已起了一种根本的变化。即它摆脱了历史上传统的、王公贵族的封建垄断束缚，摆脱了中国官僚资本和帝国主义经济的羁绊。蒙汉两区人民在中国共产党统一领导下，早已开始着一种新的贸易关系（主要指国营贸易），即真正的自由自主、平等互惠的交换有无，共同发展与繁荣两区经济。目前交易额虽不太大，但它已步入康途。
    张垣市是华北皮毛、牲口业的集散地。抗战前，旅蒙行业几全聚集此间。民国十四年到十八年间，为蒙汉贸易的全盛时代。张市的旅蒙商多到千余家，其中较大座商约三百多户。这些旅蒙商多春去秋还，或秋去翌年春还。输出以绸缎、斜纹布、生烟、砖茶、蒙靴、皮鞍为大宗，糖酒及杂物次之。根据以往材料，每年输出量，仅茶、烟、布三项：计达砖茶二十万箱、盒茶三万篓、生烟五万吨、绸、布八十万匹之多。其贸易路线，分内外蒙两路，一路到外蒙库伦、恰克图。一路到内蒙的锡林郭勒、察哈尔两盟所属各地（全程达三千六百里）。秋还时，因塞北原野水草丰盛，牲畜肥壮，便于贩运，故多换回成群的牛羊马匹。春还时，因冬季皮毛质量好，又适合皮毛制造业的生产季节，故多换回皮毛、马尾、及口芩、蘑菇、药材（羚羊角，鹿茸、麝香）等。当时往来贩运的牛车，多到两万余辆，骆驼达六千余头。换回的皮毛，屯集张市大境门外，“十里长途，叠磊成山。”仅皮毛一项，每年输入各种兽、畜皮计达八百多万张，毛、绒一千多万斤，口芩、蘑菇各百万斤，牛马羊只亦甚夥。因此，皮毛业是服务生产与带动张市贸易的纽带之一。为蒙汉贸易服务的经营、制革等行业，计有十四种之多。其输入之羊皮，百分之七十左右在张、宣两市经过熟造，缝纫成皮裘、皮褥，销于华北、东北、沪、宁各地，并有部分出口。生狐皮百分之六十外运英德等国。另百分之四十经张家口加工熟造，销于我国各大都市。毛绒百分之八十出口。口芩、蘑菇销于华南各省。
    由于地理、气候、生产、生活方式不同，蒙汉贸易带有浓厚的季节性。蒙民的牧畜按季节转移（春天追水草住坡根、夏居高地防洪水、秋季靠水利牧放、冬住凹处防大风）。作为蒙汉贸易的唯一媒介和桥梁的旅蒙商人，也随着蒙民的转移做流动生意。回蒙民经济生产落后，交通不发达。又因蒙民没有出远门的习惯，对外面货物行情不了解，以致形成工业品高、牧产品低的剪刀形的不等价交换。交换是以物易物，有时使用银币。因之商人利用这些特点，获利甚丰（其中间剥削是非常厉害的），据说商人从北平化二元钱买一个玉石烟袋嘴。就能换一匹大马。
    民国十八、九年间，蒙汉贸易起了一个巨大变化，变化原因，是国民党、军阀及其官僚资本，在政治上、经济上一贯歧视少数民族的结果，外蒙古人民共和国毅然与国民党统治区断绝了贸易关系（按外蒙于民国十年宣布独立）。当时一些蒙奸、白俄分子勾结德帝国主义，伺机组织了与所谓“德华洋行”，曾一度垄断了旅蒙贸易，但不久就被摆脱开了。这时，张垣的旅蒙商只能与内蒙保持往来，皮毛业较前遂减少了百分之六十多。
    七七事变后，日寇为大量掠夺皮毛，供给军用，专门成立了“大蒙公司”“蒙古生计会”“东蒙畜产公司”等掠夺机构，建立许可制度。再加奸特勒索，苛捐杂税，旅蒙商业几完全陷于停顿。日本投降后，云泽主席在张垣成立了“内蒙古自治联合会”之后，又组织了内蒙实业公司。在蒙民区，分设五个分公司、五个支公司，另有五个经理组，初步的恢复与沟通着蒙汉两区的贸易。张垣私人旅蒙业，经民主政府扶植，由六户增加到三十五户。张垣市的工商业，亦由日本投降时的一一○四户，增加到三二二八户。但由于敌伪顽合流，环境动荡，蒙汉贸易，一时虽难全部沟通，但蒙民八年抗战中遭遇的生活困窘，基本上已解除。以后由于国民党继续扩大反人民战争，给当地蒙汉人民带来了较日占期间更深更重的灾难。一九四六年秋，张市及察北各县，先后被国民党匪军侵占。两年来，在美帝国主义和官僚资本的洗劫下，张市旅蒙业，仅余三户。其他工商业，较我撤出前，亦减少了百分之二十五强。
    当时内蒙党政军民，在边沿区除组织当地人民开展反抢劫的斗争外，内蒙古人民解放军在内地开展剿匪安民；并与东北、华北人民解放军胜利地阻止了匪军的进犯。为制止美国经济势力入侵，内蒙自治政府，实施了保护蒙民经济生活的税收政策。两年来，由于匪军洗劫，旅蒙商裹足不前，张垣、多伦与内蒙的贸易连系实已中断。锡盟人民因察北粮源的断绝，他们在内蒙、东北两区国营商业的扶植下，开展与提高了大青盐的生产。用大青盐、皮毛，与东北换取大批食粮。其他如茶、烟、布、靴等生活必需品，亦多由东北解放区供应。但内蒙有些地区，遭受匪军们的骚拢洗劫，生活情况依然困窘。
    近二年来，内蒙古农业区实行了土改，游牧区实施了“自由放牧、保护与繁殖牧畜”的政策。农、牧产品均有增加，人民的购买力开始逐渐提高。在军事上，随着东北、华北两区的完全解放，内蒙古已肃清了多年来的匪患。特别是解放张垣之后，蒙汉贸易路线，遂即全部畅通。为了更好的开展蒙汉贸易，内蒙贸易公司除接收了原在张垣的“内蒙茶烟公司”外；今年二月一日，又成立了“西蒙贸易管理局张垣办事处”。察省贸易公司亦在张市解放后，先后成立了专业的裕民皮毛公司及多伦分公司。现华北、内蒙两区的国营贸易机关，在党的“蒙汉民族亲密团结，共同发展”的号召下，为调剂有无，繁荣两区经济，各以市场上正常公道的价格，在进行着有计划的物资交换。目前当地的情况，是允许私人旅蒙业的恢复与发展，但必须予以适当管理。最重要的是，国营商业应大力扶植与发展蒙民供销合作经济，借以逐渐减轻旅蒙商过高利润的中间剥削，打下国营经济、合作经济，进一步发展的基础。
