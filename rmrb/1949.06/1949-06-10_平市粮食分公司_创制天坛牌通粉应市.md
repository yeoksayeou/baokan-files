Ping City Grain Branch Creates "Temple of Heaven" Brand Macaroni for the Market
[Ping City News] The macaroni produced by various flour mills in the city varies in quality, making it easy for citizens to be deceived when purchasing. To ensure the citizens' need for flour, the Beijing Trading Company has clearly stipulated the standard for macaroni; under the principle of improving quality and reducing costs, the Grain Branch and local mechanized flour mills have agreed to create a "Temple of Heaven" brand of macaroni. The branch provides wheat and supervises the flour mills in processing it. Currently, the four mills that have begun processing and producing flour are Weiyi, Fuxing, Sanyang, and Tongcheng. Due to the purity of the flour and the uniformity of the product, it received high praise at the recent Industrial Exhibition. Various government agencies and schools have been purchasing from the branch. It is reported that large quantities of flour will soon be available on the market to meet the needs of citizens.
