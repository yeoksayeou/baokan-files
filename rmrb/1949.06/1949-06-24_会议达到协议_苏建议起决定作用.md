The objective diplomatic observers who pay attention to the progress of the Paris Foreign Ministers Conference cannot help but see that the decisive role in reaching an agreement lies with the Soviet Union. The Soviet suggestions have made it genuinely possible to resolve not only the issues discussed in the final communiqué of the Four Foreign Ministers, but also the fundamental German question. The establishment of a solid peace in Europe and the world largely depends on resolving the latter issue.

In this regard, it is beneficial to look back at how the Paris Conference developed and what hindered the Foreign Ministers Conference from reaching practical solutions to all unresolved issues.

On the first day of the conference, the Soviet government, through its delegation, put forward practical and specific plans to restore the economic and political unity of Germany, which had been undermined by the divisive activities of Western countries. However, in response to the Soviet government's realistic proposals, the delegations of Western countries put forward their own obviously impractical plans, deliberately designed to be rejected. The representatives of the United States, Britain, and France opposed the Soviet proposals based on the Potsdam Agreement and put forward their own plans that ran counter to the Potsdam Agreement and were therefore fundamentally impossible to pass. This shows that their aim was to maintain and deepen the division of Germany caused by their actions.

This desire of the Western representatives was also reflected in the study of the Berlin issue. During the discussion of this issue, the Soviet delegation put forward a set of constructive proposals that made it possible to resolve the Berlin issue, thereby restoring the unity of the German capital and adjusting its daily life. However, the representatives of the United States, Britain, and France opposed the Soviet proposals and put forward plans that were intentionally unacceptable, scheming to fundamentally tear up the previously concluded international agreements and attempting to extend the control of Western countries to the entire Berlin in practice. By doing so, they showed their willingness to keep the Berlin issue in a state of "suspended animation."

One of the important points of the Paris Conference was the study of the issue of preparing a peace treaty with Germany. This issue was clearly a touchstone for the true positions of the Soviet Union and Western countries on the German question. The Soviet government, with extreme clarity, raised the issue of the necessity to accelerate the preparation and conclusion of a peace treaty with Germany. The proposals put forward by the Soviet delegation conformed to the general line of Stalin's diplomacy for striving for a solid peace in the world. However, the representatives of Western countries clearly intended to set aside the issue of preparing a peace treaty with Germany, using the excuse that no agreement had been reached on the previous agenda item, and their reaction to the Soviet proposals was undisguised annoyance. They opposed the Soviet proposal, most certainly opposing the point that the peace treaty should stipulate the withdrawal of all national occupying forces from German territory within one year after the signing of the peace treaty. This once again confirmed that Western countries were trying to shelve the work of preparing the peace treaty and impose occupation regulations on Germany in order to maintain their armed forces in Germany indefinitely.

### 会议达到协议  苏建议起决定作用

    会议达到协议
    苏建议起决定作用
    凡是注意巴黎外长会议进程的客观的外交观察家，都不能不看到，会议达到协议，其决定的作用在于苏联，苏联的建议使得真正有可能解决不仅四国外长最后公报中所谈到的问题，而且还有基本的德国问题，而欧洲及全世界稳固和平的建立，大大有赖于后一方面问题的解决。
    在这方面，回溯一下巴黎会议的情形是如何发展的以及什么东西妨碍了外长会议达到切实解决所有未解决的问题是有益的。
    在会议的第一天，苏联政府就曾通过它的代表团，提出切实和具体的计划，以恢复为西方国家的分裂活动所破坏了的德国经济与政治的统一。但是，西方国家的代表团，针对苏联政府这种现实的建议，提出了他们自己的显然不切实际的计划，有意准备被否决。美、英、法的代表们，反对苏联的基于波茨坦协定的建议，并提出他们的与波茨坦协定背道而驰因而根本不可能通过的计划。由此可见，他们的目的是想保持和加深他们的行动所造成的德国的分裂。
    西方代表们的这种愿望，也表现在研究柏林问题上。在讨论这个问题的时候，苏联代表团提出了一整套建设性的建议，使柏林问题的解决成为可能，从而恢复德国首都的统一并调整其日常生活。可是，美英法代表们反对苏联的建议，并提出有意使人无法接受的计划，蓄谋根本撕破前此所缔结的各项国际协定，想在实际上把西方国家的控制扩及全柏林。他们这样做，并表明他们愿望让柏林问题仍处于“悬而不决”的状态。
    巴黎会议的重要点之一，是研究准备对德和约的问题。这个问题是分明苏联与西方国家对德国问题的真正立场的试金石。苏联政府以极度的明确性，提出了必需加速准备和缔结对德和约的问题。苏联代表团所提出的建议，符合于斯大林外交为全世界稳固的和平而努力的总路线。而西方国家代表们，却显然打算撇开准备对德和约问题，他们的借口是在前项议程上未获协议，而他们对苏联建议的反应是毫不掩饰的恼怒。他们反对苏联的建议，最确定的是反对关于和约应规定在和约签字后一年内撤退德境一切国家占领军的这一点。这再次地证实了，西方国家力图搁置准备和约的工作，并把占领法规加于德国，以便无限期地在德国保持他们的武装部队。
