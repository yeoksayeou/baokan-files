Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 13th: TASS dispatch: *Pravda* published an article by Viktorov on the Labour Party's annual conference on the 11th. The article first described the extremely tense economic situation in Britain, and emphasized that Britain has in fact become a strategic base for American imperialism. The article then analyzed the election platform adopted by the Labour Party's annual conference, saying: If we strip away its populist rhetorical embellishments, its true face is nakedly exposed. In words, the Labour Party leaders promise the people to "fight for socialism and peace," but in action, they are pushing their old anti-labor program of "industrial peace," promising the "City" of London and Wall Street to continue their policies of aggression and instigating new wars, policies of suppressing colonies, and promising to struggle to maintain the capitalist system and the interests of monopoly capitalists.

The election platform shamelessly says: Soviet leaders have rejected all British proposals aimed at consolidating peace. However, one can search throughout this document and not find any such proposals made by the British government, because such proposals simply do not exist.

The Labour Party leaders shed crocodile tears over the lack of genuine cooperation between Britain and the Soviet Union, because they know that the British people desire such cooperation. But they do not say a word about how they have undermined the development of Anglo-Soviet relations.

The strength of a chain is determined by its weakest link. No matter how hard the Labour Party leaders try to portray themselves as "guardians of peace" and ardent supporters of the United Nations, they unwittingly expose themselves, because the facts are more powerful. The platform admits that the Labour Party government played an active role in the formation of the North Atlantic military alliance, and claims that the North Atlantic Treaty is one of the strongest pillars of the United Nations. The Labour Party leaders obviously did not consider the widespread movement of the British working people protesting the North Atlantic Treaty when making such remarks.

The Labour Party's strategy is: to the British people, offer the most shameless slander and crocodile tears of feigned compassion; while to the capitalists, give a balance sheet of the Labour Party's "achievements" consisting of the Marshall Plan, the Western European Union, the North Atlantic Treaty, and the arms race.

There is no need to cite more examples from this shameful document of the Labour Party. The examples already cited are enough to convince people that the Labour Party leadership intends, as in the past, to pursue a policy of aggression, a policy of instigating wars, a policy of executing the orders of Wall Street and the "City" of London, in other words, an imperialist adventurous policy directly opposed to peace and international cooperation.

Viktorov, analyzing the part of the Labour Party leadership's platform that deals with domestic policy issues, said: It does not offer anything that gives the British people hope. The program drawn up by the Labour Party leadership aims to save the British capitalists, who are mired in increasing difficulties, at the expense of the working people. This is a program of further deceiving and betraying the broadest masses of British labor.

Viktorov concluded: The new election platform of the Labour Party leaders exposes them as loyal running dogs of monopoly capital and enemies of the working class and lasting international peace.

### 真理报评英工党竞选纲领　出卖广大劳动群众甘当独占资本走狗

　　真理报评英工党竞选纲领
  　出卖广大劳动群众甘当独占资本走狗
    【新华社北平十三日电】塔斯社讯：真理报十一日刊载维克托罗夫论工党年会一文。该文首先描述英国极端紧张的经济局势；并强调英国实际上已变成美国帝国主义的战略基地。该文继分析工党年会所通过的竞选纲领称：如果我们剥去它笼络人心的装饰词句，那么它的真面目就赤裸裸暴露出来了。在言词上，工党领袖们向人民约许“为社会主义与和平而奋斗”，但在行动上，却在推行其“工业和平”的反劳工的老纲领，约许伦敦“城”和华尔街继续执行其侵略与发动新战争的政策，镇压殖民地的政策，约许着为保持资本主义制度和保持独占资本家的利益而奋斗。
    竞选纲领无耻地说：苏联领袖们拒绝了英国一切旨在巩固和平的建议。可是，找遍了这个文件，也找不到英国政府提出过任何这样的建议，因为这种建议根本就不存在。
    工党领袖们对于英苏之间缺乏真正合作而流着猫哭老鼠的眼泪，因为他们知道英国人民希望这种合作。但他们对他们怎样破坏英苏关系的发展，却只字不提。
    锁链的是否牢固决定于它的最弱一环。不管工党领袖们怎样努力把他们自己描绘为“和平的卫士”与联合国的热烈支持者，然而，他们不知不觉就揭穿了他们自己，因为事实是更有力的。纲领里承认工党政府在成立北大西洋军事联盟中起了积极的作用。说什么北大西洋公约是联合国最强有力的支柱之一。工党领袖在发表这种谈话时显然没有考虑英国劳动人民抗议北大西洋公约的广泛运动。
    工党的策略是：对英国人民，飨以最无耻的诽谤与猫哭老鼠式的假慈悲，而对资本家，则给以以马歇尔计划、西欧联盟、北大西洋公约、军备竞赛所构成的一张工党的“成绩”表。
    用不着在工党的这个可耻的文件中再举更多的例子。已经举出的例子就足以使人确信：工党领导机关打算象以往一样奉行侵略政策，发动战争的政策，执行华尔街和伦敦“城”的命令的政策，换句话说，就是直接反对和平与国际合作的帝国主义冒险政策。
    维克托罗夫分析工党领导机关纲领中论及内政政策问题的那一段时说：他没有提出任何使英国人民有希望的东西，工党领导机关拟制的纲领，目的在于牺牲劳动人民以拯救陷于日益增长困难中的英国资本家。这是进一步欺骗和出卖英国最广大的劳动群众的纲领。
    维克托罗夫最后说：工党领袖们的新的竞选纲领，揭穿了他们是独占资本的忠实走狗和工人阶级与国际持久和平的敌人。
