　　Ping City Bathhouse Industry Capitalists' Symposium: Comrade Xiao Ming Proposes Proper Contract Negotiation
    [Reported by this newspaper] Yesterday at 3 p.m., at the invitation of the Bathhouse Industry Association, Comrade Xiao Ming of the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions addressed a symposium attended by representatives of 95 bathhouse owners regarding the establishment of labor-capital contracts. He focused on the existing problems in the industry and the ideological concerns of the capitalists. He first explained that this is currently the off-season for the bathhouse business; furthermore, some workers have a tendency towards extreme democratization, demanding excessively high compensation; and some capitalists still have doubts about the policies of the democratic government, thus adopting a passive attitude towards management. The only solution is to establish contracts that are beneficial to both labor and capital. The workers should present their demands, and the capitalists should present their opinions, and these should be put into written clauses. Representatives from the labor side's bathhouse workers' union and the capital side's bathhouse industry association should, with the assistance of representatives from the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions, reach a common agreement, so that everyone can abide by it together.

　　平市浴堂业资方座谈　萧明同志提议妥订合同
    【本报讯】昨日下午三时，市总工会萧明同志应浴堂业公会邀请，在九十五家浴堂业资方代表讨论关于订立劳资合同的座谈会上，针对该业现存问题与资方的思想顾虑发表谈话。首先说明：现在正是浴堂业生意不好的背月；加以个别工人有着极端民主化的倾向，要求过高的待遇；某些资方对民主政府的政策尚有疑虑，因而对经营采取消极态度。解决的唯一办法，就是订立对劳资双方都有利的合同。由工人提出自己的要求，由资方提出自己的意见，制成书面条文，由劳方的浴业工会的代表及资方的浴业同业公会的代表，在市总工会代表的帮助下，取得共同的协议，让大家来共同遵守。
