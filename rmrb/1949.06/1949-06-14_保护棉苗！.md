  　Protect Cotton Seedlings!
    Now cotton seedlings have emerged in various places, and aphids are already causing damage in many areas. The second battle to guarantee cotton production is already upon us. If cotton seedlings cannot be kept alive, even if the sowing is successfully completed, all previous efforts will be wasted. Protecting cotton seedlings is an urgent issue and should continue to be given importance by all regions. The North China Farm and counties such as Huolu and Wuji have good experience in promptly paying attention to using all methods to help farmers control aphids and protect cotton seedlings. We hope everyone will refer to this. All regions must resolutely eliminate pests and must not be complacent about the completed planting figures. Any complacent and carefree ideas must be thoroughly eliminated!

  　保护棉苗！
    现各地棉苗已先后出土，不少地方蚜虫又在为害，保证棉产的第二步斗争任务已经摆在眼前。棉苗如不能保活，即使播种胜利完成，也只得是前功尽弃。棉花保苗是一个紧迫的问题，各地应继续予以重视。华北农场及获鹿、无极等县，及时注意用一切办法帮助农民治蚜虫保棉苗，是很好的经验，希望大家参考。各地必须坚决扑灭虫害，绝不要为种植的完成数字所陶醉，任何高枕无忧的麻痹想法，必须彻底清除！
