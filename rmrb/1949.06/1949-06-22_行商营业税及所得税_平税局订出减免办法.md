    Business Tax and Income Tax for Itinerant Merchants
    The Ping Tax Bureau Formulates Reduction and Exemption Measures
    [Ping City News] In order to further facilitate trade between urban and rural areas and promote the exchange of goods, the Ping City Tax Bureau has formulated four important reduction and exemption regulations regarding business tax and income tax for itinerant merchants. These have been submitted to and approved by the North China Tax Bureau for preliminary implementation. The bureau has now issued a public notice announcing that the measures will take effect on June 21st. The four reduction and exemption regulations are as follows:
    1. The business tax rate for itinerant merchants dealing in grain, cotton, oilseeds, pears, dates, and melons is reduced to 1.5% (originally 3%), and combined with the itinerant merchant income tax, it will be levied at 2.5%.
    2. Those who carry goods on shoulder poles with a total value of less than 20,000 yuan, as well as self-produced and self-sold agricultural products and small handicraft products, are exempt from business tax and income tax for itinerant merchants. However, self-produced and self-sold agricultural products must have a certificate from the local village or township government.
    3. In order to differentiate between stationary merchants and itinerant merchants, industrial and commercial households from outside the city who come to Ping to sell goods must hold a stationary merchant certificate from the local tax authority or market management committee to be exempt from business tax and income tax for itinerant merchants.
    4. Publicly owned industries in various regions holding certificates from tax authorities or industrial and commercial departments are exempt from business tax and income tax for itinerant merchants.
