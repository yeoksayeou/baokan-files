　　Unprecedented Achievements in River Dredging and Canal Construction in the North China Region
  　600,000 Mu of Paddy Fields Increased
    Jizhong Region Exceeds Original Plan by 170,000 Mu
    [Reported by this newspaper] On the original foundation of more than 15 million mu of paddy fields, the North China region planned to increase paddy fields by 1 million mu this year through river dredging and canal construction. According to incomplete statistics from only six administrative offices and provinces, more than 600,000 mu have already been completed. In Chahar Province, leveraging the water resources of the Hutuo River, Sha River, Tang River, Ci River, and Ye River, there were originally 2.82 million mu of paddy fields. This year's plan is to increase by 145,000 mu. The repaired Zhengding Liberation Canal, Jingxing Democratic Canal, Huailai Yuancheng Canal, and three canals in the Jianping Special District have already increased paddy fields by more than 23,000 mu. More than 160 other newly opened and repaired medium and small canals have increased paddy fields by more than 95,000 mu, totaling nearly 120,000 mu. The Limin, Yumin, Rongzhen, and other large canals, which plan to increase paddy fields by 39,000 mu, are currently being expanded. If these are completed, the province's plan for this year will soon be exceeded. In the Jizhong region, the water resources of the Daqing River, Fu River, South Canal, Hutuo River, Baiyangdian, and Shijin Canal have been greatly developed. Anxin County has repaired 25 canals this spring, increasing paddy fields by 40,000 mu. The Jin-Gao irrigation canal has been repaired, increasing paddy fields by 15,000 mu. Despite three failures this spring, Xiong County finally completed the Daqing River water diversion project, irrigating 100,000 mu of land. Ba County has also increased irrigated land by more than 15,000 mu compared to last year. Gu'an County opened one main canal and five branch canals, extending 52 li, irrigating 100,000 mu of land. The above totals an increase of more than 270,000 mu of paddy fields, exceeding the district's original plan to increase by 100,000 mu by more than one and a half times. The 107 bridge culvert and other irrigation projects on the Shijin Canal were completed by the end of May, and the third branch canal has already released water. If all the water is released, it can irrigate 200,000 mu of land. The Funing irrigation canal is currently under construction and can irrigate 20,000 mu. The irrigation projects in Qing, Cang, and Jiaohe along the South Canal can irrigate 200,000 mu. In the Taihang region, the water resources of the Qin, Dan, Wei, Fu, and Zhang rivers originally provided for more than 1.8 million mu of paddy fields. This year's plan is to increase by 260,000 mu. The river repair and canal excavation project in the Qin River area has been completed, transforming 80,000 mu of dry land into paddy fields. The Wanzhang Canal in Huixian County has been completed, irrigating 12,000 mu of land. Anyang has repaired five large canals, increasing paddy fields by 15,000 mu. The above totals 107,000 mu. The Guangji irrigation canal in Qinyang, which will increase paddy fields by 10,000 mu, will be completed soon. In the Taiyue region, there were originally more than 165,000 mu of paddy fields. This year's plan is to increase by 40,000 mu. Jiang County has repaired and newly opened 35 canals, increasing paddy fields by more than 11,000 mu. Qinshui has repaired 18 river and canal projects, irrigating more than 4,000 mu of land. The river opening project in Jiyuan County, such as the Guangji project, will also be completed. The Jinnan region plans to increase paddy fields by 40,000 mu this year, and the current achievements have exceeded this number. The completion of the Da Feng River gate repair and canal opening project in Ningnan, as well as the repair of canals in Handan and Chengci, have each increased paddy fields by more than 30,000 mu. The counties along the Fuyang River had 380,000 mu of water conservancy before the Anti-Japanese War. During the war, they were severely damaged by the enemy and puppets, greatly shrinking the area. This spring, it has been restored to 160,000 mu. Regarding the Qi River water conservancy in the Jilu豫 region, Jun County alone has repaired canals, irrigating more than 30,000 mu of land. The magnitude of this year's achievements in river dredging and canal construction in North China is unprecedented. In addition to the liberation of the entire region, which eliminated enemy and bandit destruction, and the urgent demands of the masses for water conservancy due to the drought, the main reason is the correct leadership of the People's Government. First, the policy of improving large canals and building small canals can meet the masses' demand for quick benefits and reduce the difficulty of labor shortages, making it easier to mobilize the masses. Second, in terms of labor mobilization, changing from averaging labor based on mu to allocating labor based on the size of the benefits has greatly increased the enthusiasm of the masses. Third, the survey work is thorough and meticulous, and water conservancy technicians can work together with the masses. Not only is water conservancy being developed, but attention is also being paid to river management and flood prevention. In many places, small investments have achieved great results. Fourth, disputes among the masses are properly mediated, resolving localism between villages and households, abolishing feudal canal management and water use systems, and establishing democratic management and fair and reasonable water use methods.

　　华北全区挖河开渠成绩空前
  　已增水田六十万亩
    冀中区超过原计划十七万亩
    【本报讯】在一千五百余万亩水田的原有基础上，华北全区今年挖河开渠增加水田一百万亩的计划，仅据六个行署、省区的不完全统计，现已完成六十万余亩。察哈尔省利用滹沱河、沙河、唐河、磁河、冶河等水利，原有水田二百八十二万亩，今年计划增加十四万五千亩。现已修复的正定解放渠、井陉民主渠、怀来源成渠及建屏专区计三渠，已增加水田二万三千余亩，其他新开与修复中、小渠一百六十余道，增加水田九万五千余亩，共计增加水田近十二万亩。而计划增加水田三万九千亩的利民、裕民、荣臻等大渠正在扩修，如继续完成，很快即可超出全省今年计划。冀中区大清河、滏河、南运河、滹沱河、白洋淀、石津运河等河流水利开发很大。安新今春修渠二十五道，增加水田四万亩。晋藁灌溉渠修复，增加水田一万五千亩。雄县今春不顾三次失败，终于完成大清河引水工程，浇地十万亩。霸县引水浇田亦较去年增多一万五千余亩。固安开干渠一道，支渠五道，长达五十二里，浇地十万亩。以上共计增加水田二十七万余亩，已超出该区今年增加十万亩计划的一倍半以上。而石津运河一百零七处桥梁涵洞等灌溉工程，已于五月底完成，第三支渠已经放水，如全部放水即可浇地二十万亩。现正修筑者尚有滏宁灌溉渠，可浇二万亩，南运河青、沧、交河等地灌溉工程，可浇二十万亩。太行区沁、丹、卫、滏、漳诸大河水利原有水田一百八十余万亩，今年计划增加二十六万亩。现沁河地区的修河挖渠工程完竣，变八万亩旱田为水田。辉县万丈渠修竣，浇地一万二千亩。安阳修复五道大渠，增加水田一万五千亩。以上共计十万七千亩。而沁阳增扩水田万亩的广济灌溉渠最近即可完工。太岳区原有水田十六万五千余亩，今年计划增加四万亩。现绛县修复与新开渠三十五道，增加水田一万一千余亩。沁水修复河渠十八道，浇地四千余亩。已着手之济源县广济等河开渠工程亦将完成。冀南区今年计划增加水田四万亩，现有成绩已超过此数，仅宁南大沣河修闸开渠工竣及邯郸、成磁修复渠道，即各增水田三万余亩。滏阳河沿岸各县，抗日战争前有水利三十八万余亩，战争中受敌伪破坏，大为缩小，而今春已恢复至十六万亩。冀鲁豫区之淇河水利，仅浚县一县修复渠道，已浇地三万余亩。华北今年挖河开渠的水利成绩之大，为前所未有，除全区解放排除了敌匪破坏以及群众因天旱而对水利要求迫切之外，主要是由于人民政府正确领导的结果。第一是改进大渠、兴修小渠的方针，能适合群众得利快的要求，减少了劳力缺乏的困难，因而发动群众比较容易。第二是劳力动员上，由按亩平均摊工改为按受益大小出工，大大提高了群众积极性。第三是勘察工作深入细致，水利技术人员能结合群众共同进行，不但兴修水利，同时注意了治河防汛，不少地方且获得工小利大的成效。第四是适当调解群众纠纷，解除村与村间，户与户间的本位主义，废除封建的渠道管理与用水制度，建立了民主管理与公平合理的用水办法。
