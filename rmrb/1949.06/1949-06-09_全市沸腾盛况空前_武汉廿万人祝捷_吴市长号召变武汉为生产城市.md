　　The people of Wuhan held unprecedented mass rallies simultaneously in Hankou and Wuchang on June 4th to celebrate the liberation of seven major cities: Wuhan, Shanghai, Hangzhou, Jiujiang, Nanchang, Xi'an, and Qingdao. A total of 200,000 people attended the rallies. In Hankou, 589 units gathered at Zhongshan Park, while in Wuchang, 227 units assembled at the National Stadium. Tan Zheng, Tao Zhu, Xiao Jingguang, Li Yiqing, Wu Defeng, Zhang Zhiyi, Zhang Pinghua, Pan Zinian, Song Yiping, Cai Shubin, Yu Pingfu, Peng Yangqin, Wu Bingshui, Zhang Nanxian, Li Fanyi, Li Shucheng, Ma Zemin, Chen Jingyu and others, thirty-three in all, were elected to the presidiums of the two rallies. At the Hankou rally, Mayor Wu Defeng, when announcing the opening of the meeting, said: "Twenty-two years ago, when the Communists were betrayed by the Kuomintang and forced to leave Wuhan, they swore to the people of Wuhan that the Communist Party would definitely return. Now we have returned, we have grown stronger, we have millions of armed forces and more than three million party members." He pointed out that we must rely on the working class, unite all the people, restore and develop production, in order to transform Wuhan into a productive city and gradually improve the people's lives. Tao Zhu, Deputy Director of the Wuhan Military Control Commission, called for the restoration of production, prevention of floods, restoration of transportation, consolidation of public security, and construction of a new Wuhan. Others who spoke in succession included Zhang Pinghua, Secretary of the Wuhan Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, Minister Pan Zinian of the Military Control Commission's Cultural and Education Department, as well as representatives of workers, students, combat heroes, professors, democratic figures, and industrialists and businessmen. They unanimously expressed their gratitude to the Chinese Communist Party and the People's Liberation Army and expressed their willingness to resume work, classes, and business rapidly under the leadership of Chairman Mao, support the front lines, and strive to build a new Wuhan. The rally passed three congratulatory telegrams to Chairman Mao, Commander-in-Chief Zhu, all commanders and fighters of the field armies, and the six million citizens of Shanghai. After both rallies, torchlight parades were held. The parade stretched for more than ten miles, the whole city was boiling, and the streets and alleys were jammed. Even during the period from the winter of 1926 to the summer of 1927, when Wuhan was the center of the Great Revolution, there was no such spectacle.

　　全市沸腾盛况空前
  　武汉廿万人祝捷　
　　吴市长号召变武汉为生产城市
    【新华社汉口八日电】六月四日，武汉人民在汉口、武昌两处同时举行空前盛大的群众大会、庆祝武汉、上海、杭州、九江、南昌、西安、青岛七大名城的解放。两地到会群众共达二十万人，在汉口中山公园集合的有五百八十九个单位，在武昌国民体育场集合的有二百二十七个单位。谭政、陶铸、萧劲光、李一清、吴德峰、张执一、张平化、潘梓年、宋一平、蔡树彬、余平福、彭仰钦、武炳水、张难先、李范一、李书城、马哲民、陈经＠等三十三人被推举为两个大会的主席团。在汉口大会上，吴德峰市长宣布开会时说：“二十二年前，共产党人在国民党背叛革命，被迫离开武汉时，曾向武汉人民宣誓，共产党一定要回来的。现在我们回来了，我们壮大了，有了数百万武装，三百多万党员。”他指出：必须依靠工人阶级，团结全体人民，恢复和发展生产，才能把武汉变为生产城市，逐步改善人民生活。武汉军管会副主任陶铸号召恢复生产，防范水灾，恢复交通，巩固治安，建设新武汉。相继讲话的尚有中共武汉市委书记张平化，军管会文教部潘梓年部长及工人、学生、战斗英雄、教授、民主人士、工商业界代表等。他们一致对中国共产党和人民解放军表示感谢，并愿在毛主席领导下迅速复工、复课、复业，支援前线，为建设新武汉而奋斗。大会通过致毛主席朱总司令、各野战军全体指战员及上海市六百万市民贺电三件。两个大会后都举行火炬游行，游行行列长达十余里，全市沸腾，大街小巷途为之塞，即在一九二六年冬至一九二七年夏武汉作为当时大革命中心的时代亦无此盛况。
