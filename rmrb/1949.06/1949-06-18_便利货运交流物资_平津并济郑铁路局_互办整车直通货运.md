　　Facilitating Freight Transport and Material Exchange
  　Pingjin and Jinan-Zhengzhou Railway Bureaus
  　Jointly Implement Through-Train Freight Transport
    [Our Dispatch] To facilitate freight transport in various regions, the Railway Department of the Chinese People's Revolutionary Military Commission has telegraphed the Jinan, Taiyuan, Zhengzhou, and Pingjin Railway Bureaus, ordering each bureau to mutually handle through-train freight transport starting from June 16th. Regarding the calculation of freight charges, before the unified promulgation of the new freight rates, in order to expedite the exchange of materials in the north and to facilitate consignors, the current freight rates of each bureau will be temporarily used for separate calculation (if any bureau has specific freight rates, it is allowed to collect according to the specific freight rates within its jurisdiction), and all payments must be made in cash. The dispatch fee will be collected by the dispatching station, and the unloading fee will be collected by the destination station. The Pingjin Railway Bureau has already started handling this freight transport since yesterday (16th). Previously, the 140 li section between Dezhou and Jinan on the Jinpu Railway was not open to freight transport, so the northward transport of southern grain required transshipment by carts for a section, resulting in higher costs and affecting grain prices. Since yesterday, freight transport between Dezhou and Jinan has been unimpeded, and the grain supply in Pingjin should be more abundant.　　　　　　　　　　　　　　(Li)

  　平津并济郑铁路局
  　互办整车直通货运
    【本报讯】为便利各地货运，中国人民革命军事委员会铁道部顷电令济南、太原、郑州、平津各管理局，自六月十六日起各局互相办理整车直通货物运送。其运费计算在新运价未统一公布前，为使北方物资迅速交流和便利货主，暂按各该局现行的运价率（各局如有特定运价时准在自局管内按特定运价核收）分别计算，一律现付。发货费由发站核收，卸费由到站核收。此项货运平津铁路管理局已自昨（十六）日起开始办理。在此以前，津浦路德州、济南间共一百四十里尚不通货运，因此南粮北运需用大车转运一段，成本较高，影响粮价。自昨起德济间货运已畅通，平津粮源当更充裕。　　　　　　　　　　　　　　（立）
