How We Transformed Li Jiuming?
    Han Zuoli
    Li Jiuming was the naughtiest boy in Yucai Elementary School, currently fourteen years old, from Lishi, Shanxi. His father died early, and his sister and brother-in-law both joined the revolution. In the winter of 1944, his sister brought him to Yan'an, and in early 1945, he was sent to school (at that time, the school was still called the August First Children's Elementary School). Soon after arriving at the school, he joined a group of boys who specialized in causing trouble for the girls in his class: pulling up the flowers planted by the girls, putting tribulus on the girls' mattresses, and spitting rice on classmates' faces while eating. He also constantly stole things from his classmates. To make the classmates angry and retaliate against their criticisms of him, he would crawl out of the dormitory like a dog in the middle of the night and use a stick to break the flower lattice door of the classroom. He was always grinning, behaving like a hooligan, and completely nonchalant.

    Initially, the homeroom teacher focused on criticizing and reprimanding him. All the students in the grade also disliked him and were unwilling to play with him. Almost anything that went missing was suspected to be his doing. Whenever a criticism meeting was held, most of the time was spent criticizing him. However, the effect was minimal; he even became more and more opposed to everyone. On the surface, he appeared submissive and docile, but inwardly he harbored resentment and dissatisfaction towards everyone.

    We conducted a serious study and critique of this situation during the winter vacation of 1945. Initially, the teachers' opinions were divided: some advocated patient education for him; others advocated strict disciplinary sanctions, even expulsion. Our teachers debated fiercely two or three times. In the debate, comrades made progress, gradually clarified the problem, and reached a more unified opinion. The vast majority of comrades believed that we new educators should not easily lose confidence in educating a child or abandon the responsibility of education; Li Jiuming should still be educated seriously and patiently until he was completely transformed.

    First, we studied and understood him. On the one hand, we paid attention to his performance in various current activities; on the other hand, we visited his family to understand his past life history. As a result, we learned that he was born into a landlord and commercial family. Because he had several sisters and brothers, and he was the youngest and not very good-looking, his mother didn't have milk when he was born and he was raised by a neighbor for two or three years, so his grandfather didn't like him very much and often beat and scolded him. When he was six or seven years old and attending elementary school in his village, he was rarely given money to spend or stationery to buy, and he had to use old account books turned over as his practice books. If he did anything wrong, he was punished by being made to kneel. The elementary school he attended in his village was run by the enemy and puppets, and the teachers were alcoholics and gamblers. They practiced oppressive education, which caused him to acquire many bad habits. However, he had also participated in the village children's corps, doing communication liaison work for the local people's government and the Eighth Route Army, and he knew battlefield knowledge such as laying landmines, scouting, and carrying secret letters. Because of these things, at around the age of ten, he already had characteristics such as boldness, vigilance, stealing, hypocrisy, and mischievousness. In daily life and study, we also discovered that he was full of research spirit, liked to read science stories, and create small gadgets.

    After understanding these circumstances, the homeroom teacher often talked to him and asked his sister to help with his education, asking him to make a progress plan. The plan should be simple and specific, and the time should not be too long, so that it would be easy to implement and increase his confidence in making progress. When talking to him, his strengths were appropriately pointed out to encourage him to develop them; his weaknesses and the reasons for their formation were also clearly pointed out to make him pay attention to overcoming them. At the same time, his history was also announced to the teachers and students to arouse everyone's understanding, sympathy, and help. I remember that after we reported his history and the roots of his characteristics to the students, many students said: "Oh, I didn't know Li Jiuming had such a history! If I had known, I wouldn't have disliked him a long time ago, and I will help him make progress in the future!"

    If it was found that his stationery and other daily necessities were really lacking, the school or his sister would find ways to help him.

    The homeroom teacher also often selected good children's books, such as "Little Patriots" and "Timur and His Team," for him to read, and told him heroic children's stories to cultivate his sense of justice and integrity. His arithmetic level was poor. We used the fact that he liked science stories and loved to create small gadgets to inspire him, telling him that if he wanted to study natural science well and invent things, he must also lay a good foundation of arithmetic knowledge. We told him some stories in this regard, and he really paid attention to arithmetic class. At that time, we also helped him participate in extracurricular activities, introducing him to the library to help cut and paste materials and organize books. He did his work very well. The students working in the library asked the school to allow him to formally be a librarian. We allowed it and often checked, supervised, helped, and encouraged him.

    Gradually, everyone's view of him changed. Once, when they were going to see a play, because there were few tickets, the students in the class unanimously recommended him to see the play, saying that he had made progress. He was so moved on the spot that his eyes were glistening with tears.

    However, although he had made great progress at this time, he still lacked self-confidence. For example, when a classmate asked him to apply to join the Young Pioneers, he said, "You know I can't do it, why satirize me?" But the desire to make progress was always driving him. In the spring and summer of 1947, the school went on a long march. He performed very well along the way, obeying discipline and being able to help and unite with his classmates. When the school passed through Lishi Wangjiapo in Jin Sui for rest, he asked to join the Young Pioneers and was actually approved by all the Young Pioneers through discussion. After he joined the Young Pioneers, he behaved very actively and enthusiastically. But soon, there was a deviation, so he was strictly criticized, and he was asked to write a reflection note. In order to consolidate his progress, he was assigned to be a "little teacher" during the winter vacation of 1947, so that he could be tempered. Not long after he started working as a "little teacher," he wrote an article for the blackboard newspaper saying: "In the past, I didn't want to listen when the class chairman and teacher managed me, and sometimes I deliberately angered him to see what he could do?! Now that I am managing the young classmates, they don't listen... I realize my previous mistakes even more."

    From then on, his progress has been normal and rapid. At the end of his work as a "little teacher," he was elected as a model. Later, he was repeatedly elected as the Young Pioneer squad leader, student union member, librarian, etc. His research spirit was also more appropriately applied to his studies: he created many small natural science gadgets; learned to light gas lamps, repair clocks, etc. When students and teachers saw him, they often joked with him kindly, calling him "little scientist." He also often laughed happily, but his face was completely without that mischievous look, making people feel a sense of innocence, liveliness, sincerity, and seriousness.

　　我们怎样改造了李久铭？
    韩作黎
    李久铭是育才小学最调皮的男孩子，现年十四岁，山西离石人。父亲早死，他姐姐和姐夫都参加革命。一九四四年冬由他姐姐带他到延安，一九四五年初送来学校读书（当时学校还叫八路军子弟小学）。到校不久，他就参加在几个男孩子伙里，专们和他班上的女同学闹气：拔女生种的花，把蒺藜放在女生的褥子上，吃饭时，他往同学脸上喷饭。还不断偷拿同学的东西。为了使班上同学受气，报复同学们对他的批评，半夜里他学狗爬，爬出宿舍，用棍子把教室的花格子门敲坏。他一天到晚，嘻皮笑脸，流里流气，满不在乎。
    最初，级任教员对他是偏重在批评和指责，全级的同学，也都很讨厌他，都不愿同他在一块玩，几乎是什么东西一丢，就怀疑是他拿了。每逢开检讨会的时候，大部的时间都用在批评他的方面去。可是收到的效果是很微小的；甚至越来他越和大家对立。表面上他显得慑服、驯顺，内心里却对大家愤恨不满。
    这种情况，我们在一九四五年寒假中，曾经作过认真的研究和批判。开始，教员们的意见是不一致的：有的主张对他进行耐心教育；有的主张给以严格的纪律制裁，甚至开除他。我们教员中曾激烈地争论过两三次。在争论中，同志们得到了进步，逐渐把问题也弄明白了，意见也比较一致起来了。绝大多数同志都认为：我们新的教育工作者，不应轻易对一个儿童失去教育信心和放弃教育责任；对李久铭还是应当继续认真地耐心地进行教育，直到使他得到彻底的改造为止。
    首先，我们是研究和了解他。一方面注意他在当前各种活动中的表现；一方面访问他的家长，了解他以往的生活历史。这样做的结果，我们知道他生在一个地主兼商业的家庭。因为他姊妹兄弟好几个，他是最小的，样子长的又不怎么好看。生下来他母亲没奶，让邻人养育了二三年，所以他祖父很不喜欢他，时常打骂他。到六七岁在本村上小学时，也不常给他钱花，也不给他买文具纸张，弄些烂帐本翻过来做他的习字本。一有不对，就罚他下跪。他上的本村小学，为敌伪办的，教员酗酒、赌博。实行压迫教育，这使他沾染了不少的不良习惯。但他也曾参加过本村的儿童团，给地方人民政府和八路军做通讯联络工作，懂得埋地雷、侦察、携带秘密信件等等战地知识。由于这些，在十岁左右，他已经有了大胆、机警、偷窃、虚伪、顽皮等等特点。在日常生活学习中，我们还发觉他富于钻研精神，喜欢看一些科学的故事书，创造些小玩意等。
    了解了这些情形后，级任教员就时常找他谈话，并请求他姐姐帮助教育，要他订进步计划，计划要订得简要具体，时间也不要规定的太长，这样便于实行，容易提高他的进步信心。和他谈话时，适当指出他的优点，让他发扬；也明确指出他的缺点，和形成他这些缺点的原因，让他注意克服。同时，把他的历史也在教员中和同学中宣布，引起大家对他的了解、同情和帮助。记得在我们向同学们报告了他的历史和形成他的特点的根源之后，许多同学都说：“唉呀！我还不知道李久铭有这样的历史呢！如果知道的话，我早也不讨厌他了，以后可要好好帮助他进步哩！”
    如果发现他的文具及其他日常用品实在缺乏时，就由学校或由他姐姐处设法给以帮助。
    级任教员还时常选些好的儿童读物，如“小爱国者”“铁木儿及其伙伴”等让他读，还给他讲一些英勇的儿童故事，以培养他的正义感和忠直性格。他的算术程度是差的，我们借着他喜欢科学故事，爱创造小玩意这一点来启发他，告诉他要想把自然科学研究好，发明东西，必须同时把算术知识的基础打好。在这方面又给他讲了些故事，当真他对算术课注意起来了。当时我们又帮助他参加课外活动，介绍他到图书馆去帮助剪贴材料，整理图书。他把工作做得很好。在图书馆工作的同学，就要求学校允许他正式做图书馆的干事，我们允许了，并且经常给以检查、督促、帮助和鼓励。
    慢慢大家对他的看法有些变了，有一次要去看戏，因为戏票少，班上同学都公推他去看戏，说他有进步，当场就感动得他闪着泪花。
    可是，他这时虽有很大进步，但自信心还差，比如有同学要他请求参加少先队，他说：“你明知道我不行，何必讽刺我呢？”但进步心总是在驱使着他。一九四七年春夏间，学校长途行军，一路上他表现很好，守纪律，能与同学互助团结，学校路过晋绥在离石王家坡休整时，他要求参加少先队，竟然得到全体少先队员讨论通过了。他参加少先队后，表现十分积极和热情。但不久，便发生了偏向，就严格批评了他，并且要他写了反省笔记。为了巩固他的进步，一九四七年寒假，分配他做小先生，使他受到一些磨炼。他做小先生工作没有多久，就给黑板报写了一篇稿子说：“从前班主席和老师管我，总不想听，有时故意气他一下，看他有什么办法？！现在让我管理小同学，他们不听话…………我更认识了从前的错误。”
    从此以后，他的进步，便一直是正常的，迅速的。小先生工作结束时，他当选了模范。以后他又屡次当选少先队分队长、学生会委员、图书馆长等。他的钻研精神，也更适当的发挥在学习上了：他创造了不少自然科学的小玩意；学会了点燃汽灯，收拾钟表等。同学们和老师们看见了他，常亲切地和他开着玩笑，叫他“小科学家”。他也常快乐的笑着，但脸上却完全没有那股顽皮神气了，使人感觉到的是一种天真、活泼、诚挚与严肃。
