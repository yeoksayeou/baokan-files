[Jinnan Telegram] Government organs at the Jinnan District level have transferred a large number of people and animals to help the masses in Weixian county harvest wheat. In assisting with the harvest, they jointly established rules: no eating the masses' food or smoking their cigarettes, not dropping a single ear of grain, and obeying the commands of whoever they are working for, etc. The Administrative Office Transportation Team has extracted all twenty-seven trucks, and the Secretariat and other departments have extracted eight trucks, so that each of the seven harvest assistance teams can be equipped with five trucks. A certain company of the military region stationed in Beiguan had just returned from Anyang not long ago, and immediately helped the masses harvest wheat, regardless of fatigue. Other organs and schools are also gradually launching a wave of harvest assistance. The Jinnan Branch of the People's Bank of China and the Jinnan Trading Company sent more than 50 people, divided into four groups, to help military families and the elderly, weak, orphaned, and widowed harvest wheat in Wangjia Village. The grateful military family member Chang Hainiang said, "You gave us all the cotton we needed, and now you are helping us harvest wheat. You are better than my son at home!" The Public Security Department, in addition to providing manpower assistance, also dispatched four mules to help pull the wheat. Jinnan People's Hospital, Rongjun School, and Finance and Economics School, etc. all participated in the harvest assistance. The Xiajin Sub-district Command and the guard company, the reception center, and other units sent 105 people to help the families of martyrs, soldiers, and workers, as well as the elderly, weak, orphaned, and widowed, harvest wheat in Xiajin Chengguan. Military family members offered cigarettes and tea one after another, but they were all politely declined.

[Jinnan Telegram] To ensure that the wheat of the families of martyrs, soldiers, and workers is stored at the same time, Weixian, Julu, Qinghe, Yuanchao and other counties are strengthening their substitute harvesting work. The Julu County Committee instructed all districts to resolutely correct the past neglect of the wheat harvesting difficulties of the families of martyrs, soldiers, and workers, and to do a good job of substitute harvesting. The Da Wang Qi Village in the Seventh District of Yuanchao decided that substitute harvesting must be clean, without dropping a single ear, and without eating meals; military family member Shi Xiangcheng said: "The villagers care about us so much, our women and children must also go to the fields. If we can't cut, we can collect and bundle." Comrade Ma Meizhi, the district secretary of the First District of Pingxiang, visited the families of martyrs, soldiers, and workers in Sanhedong Village to inquire about their wheat harvesting situation and promoted it in a concrete way. Now, the district has ensured that the wheat of the families of martyrs, soldiers, and workers is harvested and stored in a timely manner. The villages of Xijie in Weixian and Pingguan in Qinghe have all made it a practice to harvest for the families of soldiers first, and then harvest their own.

　　冀南机关部队　人畜出动助收
  　注意代收军属麦子并替入囤
    【冀南电】冀南区区党委级机关，大量抽调人、畜力帮助威县城区群众收麦。在助收中共同订立规矩，不吃群众饭、烟，不掉一个穗，给谁做活听谁指挥等。行署运输队把二十七辆大车都抽出来，秘书处及其他部门抽出八辆，七个助收分队每分队可配备五辆大车。驻在北关的军区某连队，刚从安阳回来不久，即不顾疲劳帮助群众麦收。其他各机关、学校助收热潮也逐渐展开。中国人民银行冀南分行及冀南贸易公司五十余人，编成四个组，在王家庄帮助军属及老弱孤寡收麦，感激的军属常海娘说：“您给俺点的棉花都出齐了，这又帮助俺收麦，比俺儿在家还强哩！”公安处除人力帮助外，还抽出四个骡子帮助拉麦。冀南人民医院、荣军学校、财经学校等都参加助收。夏津分区司令部及警卫连、收容所等单位一百零五人，分头帮助夏津城关的烈、军、工属及老弱孤寡收麦，军属们纷纷送烟送茶，均被婉言谢绝。
    【冀南电】保证烈军工属麦子同时入囤，威县、巨鹿、清河、元朝等县加强代收工作。巨鹿县委会指示各区，坚决纠正过去对烈、军、工属的麦收困难忽视现象，做好代收工作。元朝七区大王齐村决定代收要割干净、不掉穗、不吃饭；军属史香城说：“乡亲们这样关心咱，咱家娘们孩子也得到地里去，不能割，也能收捆。”平乡一区区书马美芝同志，到三河东村一带挨户访问烈军工属麦收情况，具体推动，现该区作到烈、军、工属的麦子及时收割入囤。威县西街、清河评关等村，均作到先给军属割完再割自己的。
