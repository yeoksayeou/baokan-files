　　U.S. Labor Leaders' Emergency Meeting
  　Demands Repeal of Taft-Hartley Act
    [Xinhua News Agency, Peiping, 29th] TASS Washington, 27th: Four hundred leaders representing over one million workers from the CIO, AFL, and independent unions recently held an emergency meeting in Washington to abolish the anti-labor Taft-Hartley Act. Representatives at the meeting accused Truman and the Democratic Party of "shamelessly violating their campaign promises to abolish the Taft-Hartley Act," and demanded the repeal of the act and the restoration of the Wagner Act. The conference issued a statement to the press condemning the government's proposed amendments to the Taft-Hartley Act as "vicious anti-labor proposals." The meeting sent letters to AFL President Green, CIO President Murray, United Mine Workers President Lewis, Brotherhood of Railroad Trainmen President Whitney, and other union leaders, urging them to call a one-day nationwide strike to support the workers' demand for the complete abolition of the Taft-Hartley Act. The statement emphasized that organized labor is currently facing a severe economic crisis, with five million workers unemployed and ten million workers only working part-time. The statement claimed that American monopoly capitalists rely on the Taft-Hartley Act as a weapon to destroy the union movement and lower the living standards of American workers. The conference called on organized labor to launch a signature campaign of one million people within ten days, demanding the repeal of the Taft-Hartley Act; and demanding that members of Congress support the Marcantonio Bill to repeal the Taft-Hartley Act. The conference also requested organized labor to send a delegation to Washington to prepare for the restoration of the Wagner Act.
