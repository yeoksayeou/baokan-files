　　Workers' Home
    Jizhong Branch of the Xinhua News Agency
    In the southwest corner of Cang City, close to the east bank of the canal, nestled among trees and flowers, stand several irregular Western-style buildings, with two chimneys rising in the middle. This is the Cang City Waterworks. Like the power plant in the northeast corner of the city, it has become a beautiful home for workers.
    This waterworks, built on thirty mu of land, has more than ten mu left over after accounting for the buildings and water tanks. This spring, in February, the Hydropower Company spent money to plant hundreds of trees and various flowers and plants around the perimeter. It also hired four vegetable-growing workers, removed the stones that had been laid half a foot thick, and then turned the soil into ridges, planting spinach, spring cabbage, garlic, red radishes, etc. The families of workers like Zhao Baoxi and Shao Qingyu, who live in the two buildings to the north, often take time to help the gardeners weed. I learned from the gardeners that this vegetable garden has already harvested more than 700 jin of vegetables. Because the yield is still small, it is not sold externally. In addition to the families of workers living in the waterworks eating vegetables for free, the families of workers living in the power plant and in the city can buy fresh vegetables at 30% below market prices. In the future, after the company's allocated funds have been repaid, the profits will be used as a worker welfare fund and handed over to the workers' cooperative.
    While I was talking to the gardeners, the company sent three employees, pushing a small cart with rubber wheels, delivering millet and corn flour. This is the grain allocated by the company's workers' cooperative every half-month when wages are paid, according to the number of family members of the workers, at 3% below market prices: 15 jin of flour and 5 jin of millet per person. Children are counted as half a person. According to Shao Qingyu, whose family has six members, the grain allocated every half-month saves about ten jin of rice compared to market prices. The cooperative started allocating grain in February, and the total number of the approximately 200 workers' families of the Jiji Hydropower Company who are spared from exploitation by merchants is very large.
    Shao Qingyu's monthly salary is 360 jin of rice, which is enough to feed his family of six. The government provides each household with tap water and electricity, and they can burn coal cinders picked up from the factory. The three daughters, the sixteen-year-old in senior primary school, the fourteen-year-old and twelve-year-old in junior primary school, are given books by the government (the company provides for more than twenty school children), and they use waste paper to make exercise books. Buying pencils does not cost much. Although they are not rich now, it is much better than before (during the Japanese and Kuomintang rule). At that time, the soybean cakes and sorghum flour distributed by the Japanese contained lime and sand, and could only be made into "tuantuan" (small dumplings), which were difficult to digest. Since then, Shao Qingyu has suffered from heart palpitations and tremors. Deputy Director Zhao Baoxi, who was a veteran worker of more than ten years, only earned seventy or eighty jin of rice a month, which was only enough to feed his wife and children. He himself went to work hungry, from morning to twelve o'clock at night, eating only a corn cake. After liberation, Zhang Zhenying, director of the power plant, patiently taught him the principles of the machinery, enabling him to quickly master the machinery. He was then promoted to deputy director of the waterworks, with a monthly salary of 370 jin of rice, and his family no longer worries about food and drink.
    As we were talking, Shao Qingyu's eldest daughter came home from school, wearing a newly made white cotton blouse and navy blue uniform trousers, carrying a bundle of dried grass, saying it was for kindling. The second daughter also came in, wearing a red jacket and purple silk pants. Both of them put down their schoolbags. I casually looked at their homework. The arithmetic copybooks and Chinese notes were all written neatly. Her mother also praised them, saying: "My children have never failed a grade in school. Although we are not rich now, I must support them so that they can study, and soon they will be able to do some work." She smiled as she said this.
    After dinner, the daughters went to school with their schoolbags, and Shao Qingyu also went to the machine room. Because today is the day for the iron factory of the Hydropower Company to pour sand molds, several workers from the waterworks have gone to help. Now the workers in the various factories are united very well. Yesterday, the water from the waterworks could not be sent to the water tower, and the director and technicians of the power plant helped the waterworks repair it for a day and a night. This spirit of unity and mutual help for the sake of work is the result of their increased political awareness. Workers from various factories attend classes every day from 12:00 noon to 1:00 p.m. Through practical experience, the workers who listen to the lectures understand their position as masters of the country. People like Wang Guangzhi, Li Defa, and Gu Wenzhang in the power plant were apprentices before liberation. The factory not only did not teach them technical skills properly, but if they went near the machines or boilers to watch how things were done and wanted to learn some skills, they were considered to be in the way and would be beaten. Now, however, Zhang Zhenying, the director of the power plant, a veteran worker of more than twenty years with the highest technical skills, always explains the principles while teaching the methods of repair whenever the machines are being repaired. In this way, Wang Guangzhi and five or six others were quickly promoted from apprentices to technicians, earning about 350 jin of rice a month. In particular, Wang Guangzhi, the factory took the lead in arranging his marriage, so he did not feel any difficulty at all. After the marriage, he lived in the power plant, and now he has two chubby babies.
    In the production competition to welcome "May Day," most of the workers received bonuses for their hard work and good performance. Shao Qingyu of the waterworks received more than three thousand yuan, and the highest received the equivalent of half a month's salary. The workers' opinion: The factory is ours, so we must do a good job. If we work hard, the government will take special care of us. If we are tired from repairing machines, or if we carry coal at the station once (originally hired people to push it, now the workers volunteer to carry it), the factory will give each person a pound of pork. Your work is absolutely not done in the dark.
    Now, starting from March, the company's employees are drawing 2.5% of their salary as insurance money and 1.5% as cultural fees each month, according to the Northeast state-owned enterprise employee insurance regulations, and depositing them in the bank to better build and repair workers' homes.

　　工人之家
    冀中分社
    沧市的西南角上，紧靠着运河的东岸，树木与花朵丛里，露出几幢不规则的洋房，中间竖立着两只烟囱，这就是沧市的自来水厂。它和市东北角上的发电厂一样，都成为工人幽美的家。
    这块三十亩地基的水厂，除了房子与水池所占的地基外，尚有十余亩。今春二月间，水电公司出款在周围种了数百棵树，和各种花草。并招收了四个种菜工人，把已铺了半尺多厚的石子起出来，然后调整成畦，种上了菠菜、春白菜、蒜、红萝＠等，住在北边两幢房子里的赵保锡、＠清玉等工人家属，常抽空帮助园工拔草。我从园工口里知道这所菜园已收获七百余斤菜，因为产量尚小，并不外卖，除了在水厂住着的工属不花钱吃菜以外，住在电厂和住在市区的工人家属们，都低于市价百分之三十买到新鲜菜吃。以后准备把公司拿出来的款还齐以后，所得利润，作为工人福利事业基金，交到职工合作社里。
    我正与员工谈着的时候，公司派了三个职工，推着胶皮轮小车，送来小米、棒子面，这是本公司职工合作社在每半月发工资米时，按工人家属人数低于市价百分之三配给的粮食，每人面十五斤、小米五斤。儿童以半人计算。据＠清玉一家六口人的计算，每半月配给的粮食比市价大约可节省十来斤米。合作社从二月就开始了配给，整个既济水电公司二百来个工属，得能免于商人剥削的数字是很大的。
    ＠清玉每月薪金米三百六十斤，一家六口，吃喝都不困难。公家供给了每户自来水和电灯，自己在厂子里拣点煤核就烧不清。三个女孩子，十六岁的在上高小，十四岁和十二岁的上初小，公家（公司供给着二十多个入学儿童）给发书，自己用废纸订练习本，只是自己买点铅笔也没有什么大花费。虽说现在不富裕，要比起早先（日本和国民党统治时）强多了。那时日本配给的豆饼和高粱面，里面拔着石灰和砂粒，只能作“团团”吃，吃了拉不下屎来。从那时起，邵清玉就落下了心慌发抖的病。副厂长赵保锡，原是个十来年的老工人，一月的工资才七、八十斤米，只能照顾老婆孩子吃饭，他自己饿着肚子上班，从早晨到晚上十二点钟，只吃个棒子饼子。解放以后，发电厂张振英厂长，耐心的教给他机器原理，使他迅速的掌握了机器，才提为水厂的副厂长，每月三百七十斤工资米，一家大小再也不为吃喝发愁了。
    正说着，邵清玉的大女儿放学回来了，穿着新做的白洋布褂，藏蓝制服裤，抱着晒干的一捆青草，说是作烧的引火。二女儿也跟着进来，穿着红靠褂紫色丝裤，两人都放下挎着的书包，我顺手翻看他们的功课，算术草本和国语笔记都写的很整齐，她妈也夸奖着说：“我这孩子上学就没有降过班，虽说现在不富裕，我也得供着叫她们念书，不久就可以作点工作了。”她说着微笑起来。
    吃完饭，女儿们提着书包上学去了，＠清玉也随着到机器房。因为今天水电公司的铁工厂是倒翻沙炉的日子，下了水厂的几个工人都去帮助工作去了。现在各厂的工人都团结得很好，昨天水厂的水送不到水塔上去，电厂的厂长和技工们就帮助水厂修理了一天一夜，这种团结友爱共同为着工作的精神，是他们政治觉悟提高的结果。各厂工人每天从上午十二点到下午一点上课，听讲的工人在实际体验中，了解到自己所处的主人翁地位，象发电厂王广之、李德法、顾文章等人，解放前本是学徒，厂内不但不好好的教技术，就是到机器或是锅炉旁，看着作活，想学点技术，也嫌碍脚碍手，就得挨打。而现在，张振英厂长，二十多年的老工人，技术最高，每逢修理机器时，总是一面讲原理，一面教修理的方法，就这样，王广志等五、六人从学徒很快提升到技工了，每月要拿薪金米三百五十斤左右。尤其是王广志，厂内主持着给他结婚，使她一点也没有感到困难，结婚后就住在电厂里，现在已生了两个肥胖的娃娃。
    在迎接“五一”的生产竞赛中，大部工人因工作努力成绩良好，都得到奖金，水厂＠清玉就得了三千多元，最多的得到相等半月工资。工人们的意见：工厂是我们的了，我们就得好好的干，卖了力气公家就特别照顾，修理机器累了，或者到车站抬一次煤（原先雇人推，现在工人自愿抬），厂内就每人发给一斤猪肉，你的工作绝对做不到黑影里。
    现在公司的员工从三月份起，按照东北国营企业职工保险条例办法，每月抽工资的百分之二点五的保险金，和百分之一点五的文化费，存到银行里，为更好的建修工人之家。
