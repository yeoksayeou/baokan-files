Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, June 26th: TASS reports: The strike by members of the Canadian Seamen's Union, which has 10,000 members, against shipowners' wage cuts and reduced working conditions, has been going on heroically since March 31st and has received enthusiastic support from the world's working class. According to a recent communiqué issued by the Canadian Seamen's Union: Despite the fact that strike-breakers have adopted methods of mass arrests, beatings, and even assassinations against the striking workers, the strike has brought Canada's entire shipping industry to a standstill. At the same time, the striking workers have received unanimous support from dockworkers and seafarers in 25 countries and full support from the World Federation of Trade Unions. British ports refuse to load and unload goods for Canadian ships on the grounds that the sailors on board are all strikebreakers. The British government has had to send troops to unload ships carrying important cargo. West Coast dockworkers in the United States are also fully supporting the Canadian sailors. Australian dockworkers have announced that they will boycott Canadian ships. Dockworkers in Japan and the Philippines have guaranteed that they will never unload goods from Canadian ships. On the other hand, right-wing leaders of the Canadian Labour Congress, the American Federation of Labor, and the British Trades Union Congress have adopted a hostile attitude towards the striking sailors. The leadership of the American Federation of Labor has demanded that the British government force British dockworkers to unload Canadian ships, otherwise, they will boycott British ships. Mr. Deakin, a member of the Executive Committee of the British Trades Union Congress, has promised the American Federation of Labor that he will do his best to get Canadian ships back into service.

　　加海员罢工已坚持三月
  　廿五国工人兄弟声援
    【新华社北平二十六日电】塔斯社讯：拥有一万会员的加拿大海员工会的会员，为反对船主削减工资及降低工作条件而举行的罢工，自三月三十一日开始以来，至今仍在英勇坚持中，并获得了世界工人阶级的热烈声援和支持。据加海员工会最近发表的公报称：尽管罢工破坏者对于罢工工人采取大批逮捕、殴打甚至暗杀的手段，但罢工已使加拿大的整个船运陷于停顿状态中。同时，罢工工人已获得二十五个国家的码头工人和海员的一致声援和世界工联的充分支持。英国海港拒绝为加拿大船装卸货物，理由是船上的水手都是罢工破坏者。英政府不得不派军队去起卸有着重要货运的船只。美国西岸码头工人也完全支持加拿大的海员。澳洲码头工人宣布：他们将抵制加拿大船只。日本和匪律宾的码头工人已经保证决不起卸加拿大轮船上的货物。另一方面，加拿大劳工大会、美国劳工联合会和英国职工大会的右翼领袖，却对罢工的海员采取敌对态度。美国劳联的领导机关要求英国政府强迫英码头工人起卸加拿大的船只，否则，他们将要抵制英国轮船。英国职工大会执行委员会的委员狄金，已答应美国劳联将竭力使加拿大船只恢复航行。
