　　Joining Tracks at Lujiazhai Station
    Gao Guangwen

    The troops repairing the Lianzhen to Lujiazhai section of the Jinpu Railway, in order to join forces with the brother troops ahead as soon as possible and advance the northern section of the Jinpu Railway to be open to traffic ahead of schedule, the First and Second Companies began a heroic track-spiking competition in the morning, when the sky was still dark.

    At that time, the two track-spiking companies, full of energy, gathered below the roadbed and held separate mobilization meetings. A few short and powerful words from Squad Leader Jin Changxie of the Fifth Squad excited the soldiers even more. Everyone held their chests high, and the spiking hammers in their hands were gripped even tighter, waiting as calmly and a little impatiently as before a battle began.

    When the referee appeared on the roadbed, everyone stared at him intently, waiting for his right hand to wave and the whistle to scream. The teams immediately surged onto the roadbed with shouts like sea waves. Everyone found their position, and three people stood facing each other in a triangular formation. As the second whistle sounded, the sound of iron hammers hitting the heads of the spikes was like popping beans, ringing out in a continuous stream. In just a few minutes, several spikes had drilled straight into the sleepers.

    The spearhead of the repair work was extending rapidly forward. The two companies, each spiking one rail, shouted slogans, echoing each other, and advanced fiercely towards the target of one thousand meters.

    At the end of the one thousand meters, a red flag was planted, fluttering in the wind. The words "Brave Vanguard" were revealed for a moment, and then blown over by the wind. The heroic track-spiking companies advanced towards the red flag.

    After completing the first section, the teams gathered in two circles in the open space below the roadbed—holding meetings, studying how to spike even faster. The supervisor jumped from outside the circle into the circle, holding a hammer handle in one hand and a spike in the other, demonstrating various hammer-striking postures to everyone. When he talked about several incorrect hammering methods and showed them to everyone, it made people burst into laughter. Afterwards, everyone happily sang songs, and as they sang, they became so excited that they began to dance. Two people formed a row, holding hands, and marching in neat steps. The loud singing and orderly formation attracted people walking on the road to stop, opening their mouths and smiling at the soldiers. Groups of children even came forward and held the soldiers' hands, asking them to teach them songs.

    Thirty minutes later, the second competition began with the sound of the whistle. In the whistling cold wind, the comrades took off their cotton-padded coats and tied them around their waists, running bare-chested and sweating profusely. They completely forgot themselves in the engineering battle, with only a heart to "catch up" and the desire to win merits in the competition. The squad led by meritorious worker Yin Panzhen always ran at the front, like a sharp knife cutting through the enemy's陣 and developing rapidly forward. Jin Hongchun's squad was closely linked together, and the three of them rushed forward step by step. This time, the heroes created an astonishing record. When the referee announced "Six hundred and forty meters of track spiked in thirteen minutes," a wave of victorious cheers erupted on the scene.

    The third time, the fourth time… it continued on and on. The sun approached the horizon, and the sky darkened.

    The oxcarts pulling the rails, which everyone had been eagerly waiting for, drove from the road all the way onto the steep roadbed. The rails were unloaded from the carts and immediately placed on the sleepers, joining the ends. In the pitch-black night, accompanied by majestic songs, the sound of hammering iron rang out again in the back. The iron hammer struck the spikes, sending sparks flying in all directions. Far to the south, the lights of automobiles illuminated half the sky. The brother troops used this as lighting material to repair towards this side.

    The next morning, when these two heroic railway troops met at Lujiazhai Station, the sun rose from the east, radiating brilliant light, shining on the two blood-red flags. In the cheers of victory, the last spike was hammered in, and the heroes marched in neat ranks, singing war songs, and advanced.

    They will stride southward to repair, paving the people's railway across the Yangtze River! To welcome the victory of the whole country!

　　接轨在吕家寨站上
    高光文
    抢修津浦路连镇到吕家寨段的部队，为了早些和前面的兄弟部队会合，使津浦路北段提前接轨，在早晨，天还黑蒙蒙的时候，一、二中队便开始了英雄的打道钉竞赛。
    当时，两个打道钉连队精神饱满地集会在路基下面，分别地开会动员。五分队长金昌燮同志的几句简短有力的话，激动得战士们一个个更加兴奋和紧张。每个人都把胸脯挺得高高地，手里的道钉锤，更握得紧了些，象在战斗开始之前那样冷静而又稍微有些急燥地等待着。
    当评判员出现在路基上时，大家都紧张地目不转睛地盯住他，等他的右手一扬，哨子尖叫一声，队伍立刻象海浪一般呐喊着涌上了路基。大家找到了自己的位置，三个人摆开三角形面对着站好。随着响起第二遍哨子，只听得铁锤打着道钉头的声音，象爆豆似的响成一片，只几分钟工夫，几根钉子都笔直地钻进枕木里去。
    抢修的矛头急遽地向前伸展着，各打一根铁轨的两个连队，一先一后，喊　着口号，大家呼应着，向一千米的目标猛进。
    在一千米的尽头上，插着一面红旗，迎风呼喇喇地飞舞着。“勇敢前锋”几个大字，一会露出来，一会又被风吹翻了过去。英雄的打道钉连队朝着红旗前进。
    打完第一段的时候，队伍在路基下面的开阔地上围成两个圈子——开着会，研究怎样能打得再快些。监工员同志从圈外跳进圈里，他一手握着锤子把，一手捏着一根道钉，给大家做着各种下锤的姿势。当他讲到几种不对头的打法而且做给大家看的时候，把人们惹得哄笑不止。过后，大家愉快地唱着歌，唱着唱着兴奋得跳起舞来，两个人成一排交握着双手，迈着整齐的步伐。洪亮的歌声和整齐的队形吸引着公路上走着的人们停下来，张着嘴笑望着战士们。一群群小孩们甚至走上前来和战士们拉着手，要他们教歌。
    三十分钟后，第二次竞赛在哨子声里开始了。同志们在呼呼的冷风里，把棉袄脱下来绑在腰上，光着膀子，汗流夹臂地奔跑着。他们在工程战斗里完全忘掉了自己，只有一个“赶上前去”的心和要在竞赛中争取立功的意念。功臣尹判镇同志所率领的小组，总是跑在最前面，象一把尖刀豁开了敌阵，迅速地向前发展着。金洪淳的小组紧紧连在一起，三个人一步不拉地向前赶着。这次英雄们创造了惊人的纪录，当评判员宣布“十三分钟打完六百四十米道钉”时，现场上响起了一片胜利的欢呼。
    第三次、四次……一直继续下去。太阳挨上了地平线，天色黑下来了。
    大家翘脚等待好久的拉铁轨牛车，从公路上一直赶上了陡陡的路基。钢轨从车上卸下来，马上就搁在枕木上接了头。在伸手不见五指的黑夜里，后面，伴着雄壮的歌声，又响起了“叮当”的打铁声。铁锤砸着道钉迸出四散的火花。在远远的南边，汽车的灯光照亮了半面天空，兄弟部队就以此作照明材料向着这面抢修。
    第二天早晨，当这两支英雄的铁道部队会师在吕家寨站上的时候，太阳从东方升起来，放射着辉煌的光芒，照射着两面血红的大旗。在胜利的欢呼里，打完了最后一颗道钉，英雄们排着整齐的行列，高唱着战歌，前进了。
    他们要大踏步地向南赶修，把人民的铁路铺过长江去！迎接全国的胜利！
