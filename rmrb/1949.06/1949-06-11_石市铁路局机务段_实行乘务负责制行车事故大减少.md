Shijiazhuang Railway Bureau Locomotive Depot
　　Implements Engineer Responsibility System, Greatly Reducing Train Accidents
    [Shijiazhuang Electric] The Shijiazhuang Railway Bureau Locomotive Depot has launched a competition centered on implementing the engineer responsibility system to ensure train safety, achieving results from May 1st to 25th. The depot has now contracted out 28 locomotives (out of a planned 45), and the sense of responsibility among the train crews has generally strengthened. For example, driver Guo Shunhai was transporting a crane from Lujiazhuang to Duanting. While traveling through the Huoqiao Bridge at kilometer 185, he suspected that the crane was higher than the bridge. He immediately stopped the train and measured, and found that it was indeed 30 meters higher than the bridge. Due to his sense of responsibility, a major derailment accident was avoided. From the beginning of the month to the middle of the month, a total of 20 track warrant incidents occurred. Five of these were the responsibility of the train crews, and the crews who failed to fulfill their duties were criticized by all the crews at the review meeting. In terms of repairs, the number of Class B and C locomotive repairs (boiler cleaning) has maintained a record of four locomotives per day, and the quality has also improved. For example, the elimination of air pump and water pump failures. Before May, the most frequent locomotive failures were water pumps and air pumps, but there have been no such failures this month. Regarding the saving of raw materials, in addition to the "Water Supply Station" trial burning coal stone to save 15 tons of coal, using scrap steel bricks to polish the copper "Shijiazhuang No. 1" license plate also saved three files. At the coal pit, the water intake time for each locomotive was set at 20 minutes, overcoming the past inaccuracies.

　　石市铁路局机务段
  　实行乘务负责制行车事故大减少
    【石家庄电】石市铁路局机务段以实行乘务负责制，保证行车安全为中心展开竞赛，自五月一日至二十五日，已获得成绩。该段现已包出机车二十八台（原计划四十五台），乘务员的责任心普遍加强。如司机员郭顺海从芦家庄载起重机到段廷，行经一八五公里花桥梁时，他自忖起重机比桥梁高，立即停车测量，结果真比桥梁高出三十米耗；由于他的责任心，免除了翻车的重大事故。自本月初到月中，路牌事故共发生二十次，应该乘务员负责的五次，未尽到职责的乘务员，在检讨会上受到了全体乘务员的批评。装修方面，机车乙丙检修（洗炉）数量保持每天四台的纪录；质量也提高了：如风泵、水泵事故的消灭。五月以前，机车事故中最多的是水泵和风泵出毛病，本月则没有出过此项毛病。对于原料的节省，除“给水所”试烧煤石省煤十五吨外。用废钢砖打磨铜质的“石家庄第一号”车牌，也省下三把锉刀。煤吭上，订出每台机车的上水时间为二十分钟，克服了过去的不准确现象。
