    The meeting then listened to the report of Comrade Ouyang Zurun, who was sent by the ACFTU to attend the Tenth Congress of Trade Unions of the Soviet Union. He praised the success of the Soviet Trade Union Congress and reported in detail that the Soviet working class, whether before the war, during the anti-fascist patriotic war, or after the war, in the implementation of the Soviet socialist construction's new five-year plan and the struggle to defend world peace and democracy, has made brilliant contributions and achieved great success. The experience of the Soviet working class and trade union work is worthy of careful study by the Chinese working class. After listening to Comrade Ouyang Zurun's report, the meeting unanimously agreed that the great achievements of the Soviet working class are the best guarantee and the greatest victory for world peace and democracy, and are the best model for the Chinese working class to fight for its own liberation and the liberation of the people of the whole country; therefore, it was decided to strengthen the introduction of the great achievements and experiences of the Soviet socialist construction in all aspects, and to strengthen the propaganda of friendship between the people of China and the Soviet Union.

    Finally, the meeting discussed that in order to adapt to the new situation of the workers' movement after the liberation of major cities such as Beiping, Tianjin, Jinghan, and Shanghai, it is necessary to strengthen the leadership of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions. The Standing Committee unanimously elected Comrade Liu Shaoqi, a long-term leader of the Chinese workers' movement and one of the leaders of the Chinese Communist Party, as the Honorary Chairman of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, and decided to divide the ACFTU's organization into eight departments, two offices, one research office, and three committees.

In addition, the meeting also appointed specific individuals to be responsible for preparing for the establishment of five industrial trade unions for railways, post and telecommunications, textiles, seafarers, and mines. The original "Work Committee for the Kuomintang-Controlled Areas" was abolished because it had no more work to do as the country was about to be completely liberated.

In the autumn of the same year, he went to work for the Anyuan Trade Union in the famous Pingxiang coal mining area, and later served as the chairman of the trade union, making the Anyuan Trade Union one of the most solid and lasting cores of the early Chinese workers' movement.

In the winter of the same year, he returned to the All-China Federation of Trade Unions in Guangzhou. After the Northern Expedition reached Wuhan, he worked in the Hubei Federation of Trade Unions in Wuhan. After the failure of the Great Revolution from 1925 to 1927, he turned to underground work, but still focused on leading the revolutionary workers' movement. In the autumn of 1932, he went to the Jiangxi Revolutionary Base to continue working for the All-China Federation of Trade Unions.
