　　Chapter Four: A Vicious Plot (Continued 1)
    Terrible! The breach is more than ten feet wide! People are at a loss, with no solution! At this critical moment, a "large trough boat" came up the water, a large boat from the district to buy reeds. The old platoon leader and Shuangxi led it over. The boat was full of reeds, more than ten feet high. Entering the breach, Shuangxi shouted from the bow: "Hold on! Hold on!" The old platoon leader shouted: "Quickly smash the bottom of the boat! Quick! Smash it hard!" The boat sank. People surged up, throwing all kinds of furniture and firewood on top. DaShui shouted loudly: "Quickly carry mud! Pass it on one by one!" As he spoke, he rushed down, picked up a large lump of mud, and handed it to the person next to him, one passing it to the next, quickly passing it up. For a time, the village cadres led, standing in several rows, passing the mud lumps upwards one after another. After a long time of commotion, they finally blocked the breach.
    Toward dusk, the rain stopped. Mist was rising on the water and on the ground. The people guarding the dike did not dare to rest. Once it got dark, lanterns and torches were active again. On the fourth day, the water stopped rising, but people still did not dare to leave the dike. In the late afternoon, the water began to recede. The seriously ill old platoon leader finally went back to rest. Everyone breathed a sigh of relief; from the dike, they saw the crops in the fields were lush green, growing even more vigorously. The sorghum had shot up more than ten feet high, the corn had red tassels, the cotton had formed bolls, rice, millet... at least eighty percent of a good harvest. The old people were so happy that they couldn't help but chant a Buddha's name, and the children clapped their hands and laughed. Young people said: "It was worth it to get through these days, no matter how hard it was, it was pleasant!" The villagers said that the cadres had really worked hard this time; they all urged Shuangxi, DaShui and the village cadres to go back and rest. These three days and three nights were really hard on them! They were so busy that they didn't even have time to eat; when they did, they ate a bite or two of steamed buns with others; when they didn't, they vaguely got by; how could they have closed their eyes! At this moment, Shuangxi and DaShui looked at each other. DaShui said: "Wow! Look at you, like a mud bodhisattva!" Shuangxi said: "Brother, don't laugh at me, we're both about the same!" Saying that, they both laughed and went back to the village office, giggling.
    The houses in the village office were all leaking, and the kang and the ground were full of water. They went to the team headquarters and found a room that didn't leak. The two of them roughly wiped their faces. DaShui saw that Shuangxi's face was even thinner and yellower, and his eyeballs were full of bloodshot; he hung the towel on the rope, as if he couldn't even stand steady. DaShui knew that when Shuangxi used to be a weaver, he had to weave twelve bolts of striped cloth in five days, staying up half the night often, and he was often so tired that he vomited blood; he was an old party member, and whenever there was work to do, he always worked day and night; just these three days and three nights, he was really holding on with his skeleton. Seeing that his eyelids couldn't even open at this moment, he was still busy wiping his gun. DaShui lovingly pulled him and said: "Look what you've become! I'll wipe it for you, you go and rest." He snatched Shuangxi's gun and pushed him to the kang to sleep. But Shuangxi struggled and said: "No, aren't you just as tired!" The two of them argued back and forth, and the result was that DaShui wiped Shuangxi's gun, and Shuangxi wiped DaShui's gun, and the two of them faced each other and wiped. After wiping the guns, they were both very sleepy; they didn't eat or light the lamp, and like two tired oxen, they lay down and fell asleep.
    That night, every household ate a relaxing meal and rested early. Only the militia小组 were on duty in shifts guarding the dike. Gao Tun'er volunteered to supervise back and forth on the dike.
    At night, the enemy moved out. Upstream of the river, at a dangerous pass they occupied, they gathered two or three hundred laborers to demolish the dike. The laborers were unwilling to do it, and the Japanese immediately stabbed three of them and threw them into the river. Some laborers tried to escape and were shot dead by the Japanese. The laborers were forced to obey. The dike was very high. The Japanese directed them to dig on the side without water first, digging for dozens of feet. When they were about to dig through, they picked a small gap in the middle, and people hurriedly dodged to both sides, running far away. The water rushed down with a whoosh, and in a short time, a breach of more than a hundred feet was opened. The sound of the water could be heard twenty miles away.
    Shuangxi and DaShui were sleeping soundly when suddenly Gao Tun'er woke them up, anxiously saying: "You're still sleeping! The enemy has breached the dike over there, and the water is already coming down!" The two of them jumped up and heard the militiamen running in the street shouting: "It's bad! It's bad! The water's coming! Everyone wake up!" Shuangxi quickly pulled DaShui and went to the roof to look. The crescent moon was shining in the sky, and the sound of the water was getting closer and closer. They could see the white water surging all the way, chasing foxes and rabbits running and screaming. The village was noisy, and many people ran anxiously to the roofs to watch. They saw that the water was coming so fiercely, the good crops—the good crops, were immediately flooded! Seeing that the water was about to enter the village, it was too late to build embankments on the edge of the village! People shouted and yelled, hurriedly pouring the grain from the houses onto the roofs, some holding things and running to the boats. But the water had already entered the village! The villagers cried in a chaotic uproar, and an old woman screamed in a shrill voice: "Oh—my God! We can't live anymore!" Niu DaShui felt like he was being stabbed with knives, and couldn't help but sob and cry. Shuangxi felt golden stars in front of his eyes, a burst of heat in his chest, a fishy taste in his throat, and vomited a few mouthfuls of blood; he sat down with a thud, leaned against the flower wall and looked up, unable to catch his breath.

　　Three
    The next day, the water rose higher and higher, rising a foot every while, and many houses collapsed. People crowded in piles on high houses, some fleeing in boats. Everywhere was the sound of crying!
    That year, the enemy breached several places, "using water instead of soldiers," flooding several counties. In this area alone, more than a thousand hectares were flooded! The higher-level Party and government urgently mobilized the people in the non-disaster areas to donate relief; the cadres tightened their belts, allocated large quantities of public grain, and opened water relief. Boat after boat, boat after boat of grain, were transported in. Each person was given six taels of rice per meal. There was also firewood, and funds... When the water receded, the government also adjusted wheat seeds and mobilized wheat planting; it also organized women to weave mats and baskets; and led men and women to engage in various sideline productions. The disaster-stricken villagers were able to overcome the disaster.
    During the disaster relief, Shuangxi and DaShui often went to He Village to help with work, and also went to see Yang Xiaomei by the way. No one in Xiaomei's family knew how to use boats to manage fish, nor did they know how to do other livelihoods, and life was very difficult; she also received government relief and assistance. Zhang Jinlong didn't say it, but he was very grateful in his heart. Hei Laocai wrote to urge Xiaomei to go to work. Xiaomei said to Zhang Jinlong: "I've been staying at home for too long, I have to go back to the district quickly. The child can stay with me. As long as you agree to me working, I can still come back and see you when I have time." Zhang Jinlong thought for a long time and said: "Okay! If you want to go, then go." And helped her pack her bedding. The old man called him out and whispered: "What, you're letting her go?" Zhang Jinlong said: "If I don't let her go, what can I do! Will the higher-ups allow it?" The old man thought for a while and there was nothing he could do. Zhang Jinlong held the child and sent Xiaomei to the district.
    Near the end of the year, the father-in-law took Xiaomei and her child back. The family was still considered harmonious. Zhang Jinlong held the child up with both hands, looked at it and said: "Ha! This kid is much bigger!" Everyone teased the child, and there was talk and laughter.
    The next night, Zhang Jinlong ran into He Shixiong's son, He Goupi, on the street. He Goupi grabbed him and said: "Let's go, let's go, let's go to my house for a few drinks!" At this time, He Shixiong had secretly returned and was hiding at home. Ever since Commander Lü reorganized his troops, he had fled out of a guilty conscience and mixed with Zhang Yinwu of the Kuomintang for a period of time; this time Zhang Yinwu sent him to the city to go to the Japanese; he secretly passed through here and went home to see him. He remembered that Zhang Jinlong was good at shooting and bold, and had many uses, so he specially sent his son to call Zhang Jinlong over, wanting to take him away.
    Zhang Jinlong followed He Goupi to He's mansion. Passing through halls and courtyards, to the north house of the third courtyard, he walked into a very exquisite suite: the inside was brightly lit; warm and cozy, with a Western-style coal stove. He Shixiong sat in a circle chair, smiling and greeting him. Zhang Jinlong didn't know that he had secretly returned, and was very surprised when he suddenly saw him. He Shixiong was wearing a lambskin hat, wearing a fox fur robe, with a rosy face, looking even fatter. He told He Goupi to pour wine, and the three of them drank.
    He Shixiong drank happily, took off his fur hat, revealing his bald head, and looked at Zhang Jinlong with a pair of triangular eyes, asking about his well-being with great concern; and said very enthusiastically: "Jinlong! Don't suffer at home, go out with me! You've been with me for more than ten years, and I trust you very much. You are a man of talent, go out and work hard, and I will definitely promote you! I would rather raise a dragon than raise ten bears! I'm telling you this because you're close to my heart. You should consider it carefully!"
    Zhang Jinlong asked: "Where are we going?" He Shixiong took a sip of wine and slowly told him: "You must first understand the current situation. The Japanese are nothing to be afraid of, the most hateful are the Communists. In the future, they will share wives, which is terrible! Now their power is developing day by day, this is our greatest worry! Our superiors have long decided to first use Japan to 'defeat' the Communists, and then turn around to resist Japan. Look at our Vice President Wang Jingwei, he has already established the Nanjing government; nominally, he is following Japan, but in reality, he is preserving strength, seizing power, and what will he do in the future, isn't it convenient? Don't believe in that set of Communists; their tails are like rabbits' tails - they won't last long! You come with me to the city, and in the future, when we exterminate the Communists, won't this area of hundreds of miles be in our hands!"
    Zhang Jinlong was very active in his heart, and asked: "Where is Deputy Regiment Commander Guo now?" He Shixiong said: "Old Guo and Li Liuzi and his gang have entered the city first. Our superiors have already contacted the city, and are just waiting for me to go." He also said with a smile: "Isn't it just our bunch, big and small, all officials." Zhang Jinlong drank until his veins bulged, he put down his wine glass and said: "Regiment Commander He, you also know my personality, I always speak straight! If Guo San Mazi is there, I won't go anyway!" He Shixiong smiled and said that Lao Guo's misfire was definitely not intentional. He Goupi next to him also persuaded Zhang Jinlong. In the end, Zhang Jinlong vaguely agreed. Before leaving, He Shixiong gave him ten taels of opium, saying: "Don't reveal a word about this! I'll call you when I leave." Zhang Jinlong then went back.

    Xiaomei coaxed the child to sleep, and was working under the lamp. It was very late, and Zhang Jinlong still hadn't returned; she thought with dissatisfaction: "This guy must be fooling around again!" Seeing that the two lamps were running out of oil, she was about to rest when she suddenly saw Zhang Jinlong coming back with a flushed face, drunk.
    Xiaomei asked him: "Where did you go? Coming back so late at night!" Zhang Jinlong vaguely said: "Didn't go anywhere. Met an acquaintance and had a few drinks." Xiaomei asked: "Who did you meet?" Zhang Jinlong fell on the kang and said: "Who I met, you wouldn't know even if I told you. I'm dying of thirst, quickly boil some water!" Xiaomei went out to fetch firewood. Zhang Jinlong got up quickly, took out the opium from his arms, and hid it behind the photo frame on the wall; after looking at it, he took it down again, worriedly; unable to find a good place for a while, he stuffed it under the wardrobe, in a broken overshoe. Only then did he get on the kang, take off his clothes and lie down.
    Xiaomei had a trick up her sleeve, she had already seen it outside the window. She brought the firewood in without saying a word, and while boiling water, she secretly reached out to touch under the wardrobe; she touched a paper bag, and secretly opened it to take a look, saw that it was opium, and then put it in her arms. After boiling the water, she filled a bowl and placed it on the edge of the kang, pushing Zhang Jinlong awake. (To be continued) (Attached picture)

　　第四回　毒计（续一）
    坏了！口子决开一丈多宽了！人们都抓了瞎，没有招儿了！正在这个节骨眼儿，水面上来了个“大槽子”，是分区来买苇的大船，老排长和双喜把它引来了。船上满满装的苇，有一丈多高。进了这决口，船头上双喜喊：“撑住！撑住！”老排长叫：“快把船底砸破！快！使劲砸！”船沉了。人们一下子拥上来，把各种家具柴禾扔在上面。大水高声喊：“快抱泥！一个个的传！”说着奔下来，抱起一大块泥疙瘩，递给旁边的人，一个传一个，很快传上去了。一时，村干部们领导着，站了几排人，纷纷的把泥疙瘩往上传。闹了好半天，才把口子堵住了。
    傍黑，雨停了。水面上，地面上，雾腾腾的。护堤的人们不敢歇。天一黑，灯笼火把又活动起来了。第四天，水不再涨，人们可还不敢离开堤。后半晌，水开始往下抽了。病重的老排长，才回去歇息。大家也松了一口气；从堤上望见地里的庄稼绿油油的，越发长得旺了。高粱窜了一丈多高，棒子吐了红缨儿，棉花结了桃，稻子、谷子……顶少有八成年景。喜得老人们忍不住念一声佛，孩子们拍着巴掌笑。年轻人说：“熬了这几天总算没白费，再苦也是痛快的！”老乡们说，这回干部可卖了力气啦；都劝双喜大水和村干部们回去歇歇。这三天三夜，真够他们受的！忙得饭也顾不上吃；赶上了，跟人家吃一口两口饽饽；赶不上，稀里糊涂的也过去了；又哪里合过眼呀！这会儿双喜大水你看着我，我看着你。大水说：“吓！看你，跟个泥菩萨似的！”双喜说：“大哥别说二哥，两个差不多！”说着都笑了起来，嘻嘻哈哈回村公所去。
    公所的房子都漏了，炕上地上尽是水。到队部，找了个不漏的屋子，两个人胡乱擦了擦脸。大水见双喜的脸儿更瘦更黄了，眼球上满是血丝儿；他把手巾搭在绳子上，好象站都站不稳了。大水知道：双喜以前当织布工人的时候，五天一个集，要织出十二匹花条布，尽半宿半宿的熬，常累得吐血；他是个老党员，一有什么工作，总是黑间白日的干；就说这三天三夜吧，真是硬撑着骨头架子抗呢。这会儿看他眼皮子都睁不开，可还忙着擦他的枪。大水心疼的拉着他说：“看你成了什么样儿啦！我来给你擦，你快歇歇吧。”他抢了双喜的枪，推他到炕上去睡觉。可是双喜挣扎着说：“别，你还不是一样的累啊！”两个人争来争去，结果是大水擦双喜的枪，双喜擦大水的枪，两个人面对面的擦起来。擦好枪，困劲儿都上来了；他俩饭也不吃，灯也不点，就象两条耕乏了的牛，躺下就睡着了。
    这一天晚上，家家户户吃了松心饭，都早早儿歇息了。只有游击小组轮班的守着堤。高屯儿自告奋勇，在堤上来回监督着。
    夜里，敌人出动了。在河的上流，他们占的一个险口那儿，集中了二三百民夫，来扒提。民夫们不愿意动手，当场给鬼子挑了三个，丢进河里。有些民夫偷跑，给鬼子开枪打死了。民夫们逼得没办法，只好依着干。堤很高。鬼子指挥着先挖没有水的一边，挖了十几丈长。快要挖透的时候，在中间挑了个小豁口，人急忙往两边闪开，跑得远远的。水唰的冲下来，不多时，一个口子就开了一百多丈。那水响的声音，二十里地远都听见了。
    双喜大水正睡得死死的，忽然高屯儿把他们推醒，着急的说：“你们还睡觉！敌人那边决了堤，水已经下来了！”他两个跳起来，就听见游击队员在街上跑着大喊：“坏啦！坏啦！水下来啦！大家快起来哟！”双喜急忙拉着大水，上房顶去望。月牙儿在天边照着，水声越来越近。望得见白花花水头一路卷过来，赶得狐狸兔子乱跑乱叫。村里人声嘈杂，很多人着急的跑到房上看。只见水来的那么猛，好庄稼——好庄稼，立时都给淹了！眼看着水就要进村，村边打埝子也来不及了啊！人们喊着叫着，慌忙把屋里的粮食往房上倒，有的抱着东西往船上跑。可是水已经进村了！村里人乱哄哄的大哭小喊，有个老婆儿尖声的嚎叫：“哎哟——我的老天爷啊！可不得活了呀！”牛大水心里跟刀子＠①似的，忍不住呜呜的痛哭起来。双喜觉得眼前冒金花，心口一阵热，喉咙里很腥气，哇哇的吐了几口血；他一屁股坐下来，靠在花墙上仰着头，蹩得喘不过气来。
　　三
    第二天，水越往上涨，一会儿涨一尺，好些房子倒塌了。人们在高房上挤成堆，有的逃在船上。到处都是哭声！
    这一年，敌人扒了几处口子，“以水代兵”，淹了好几个县。光这一片，就淹了一千多顷！上级党和政府，急忙发动没受灾地区的老百姓，募捐救济；干部们节衣缩食，拨出大批公粮，开水赈。一船船，一船船的粮食，运来了。每人一顿按六两米发。还有柴禾，还有款……水退了，政府又调剂来麦种，发动耩麦子；还组织妇女织席编篓；领导男男女女搞各种副业生产。遭难的老乡亲，才渡过了灾荒。
    赈灾当中，双喜大水经常到何庄帮助工作，也顺便去看看杨小梅。小梅家里没人会使船治鱼，又不会干旁的营生，生活挺困难；也得到了政府的救济和帮助。张金龙嘴里不说，心里可是很感激。黑老蔡来信催小梅去工作，小梅跟张金龙说：“我在家里待得太久了，得赶快回区上去。孩子带在我身边就行。只要你同意我工作，我有空还可以回来瞧瞧。”张金龙想了半天，说：“行！要走你就走吧。”就帮她打整铺盖。老头儿叫他出去，悄悄说：“怎么，你放她走啊？”张金龙说：“不让她走怎么着！上级依吗？”老头儿想想也没办法。张金龙就抱着孩子，送小梅到区上去了。
    年跟前，公公把小梅娘儿俩接回去。一家人还算和气。张金龙两手把孩子举起来，看着说：“哈！这小子，大得多啦！”大家逗孩子玩儿，倒也有说有笑的。
    第二天晚上，张金龙在街上碰见何世雄的儿子何狗皮。何狗皮一把拉住他说：“走走走，到我家喝两盅去！”这时候，何世雄已经偷偷的回来了，躲在家里。自从吕司令改编他的队伍，他自个儿心虚逃走，在国民党张荫梧那儿混了一个时期；这回张荫梧派他进城，到日本人那儿去；他秘密的路过这里，顺便回家瞧瞧。他念着张金龙的枪法好，胆子大，用处很多，特意打发儿子把张金龙叫来，想把他带走。
    张金龙跟着何狗皮，来到何家大宅。穿堂过院，到第三进的北屋，走进了很精致的套间：里面灯光很亮；暖暖和和，生着洋式的煤炉子。何世雄坐在圈椅里，笑着跟他招呼。张金龙不知道他偷着回来，猛一瞧见，很是惊奇。那何世雄戴着羔皮帽，穿着狐皮袍，红光满面的，象是更胖了。他叫何狗皮给斟上酒，三个人就喝起来。
    何世雄喝得高兴，摘下皮帽子，露出光溜溜的秃脑瓜，一对三楞子眼儿瞅着张金龙，挺关心的问长问短；又很热心的说：“金龙！别在家里受罪啦，跟我出去跑跑吧！你跟了我十来年，我挺凭信你。你是个有材料的人，出去好好儿干，我准提拔你！我是宁养一条龙，不养十个熊！跟你知心贴肉，才说这个话。你好好儿斟酌斟酌吧！”
    张金龙问：“咱们到哪儿去？”何世雄喝了一盅酒，慢慢儿跟他说：“你先要明白现在的大势。日本人倒没有什么可怕，最可恶的是共产党，将来共产共妻，可了不得啊！现在他们的势力一天天的发展，这才是我们的心腹大患呢！咱们上面早决定了，先利用日本，‘克’了共产党，再回过头来抗日。你看咱们的副总裁汪精卫先生，已经成立了南京政府；名义上虽说是随了日本，其实保存下力量，抓住大权，将来要干什么，还不方便？你别信共产党那一套；他们是兔子的尾巴——长不了！你跟我到城里去，将来剿灭了共产党，这方圆几百里，乾坤还不掌握在咱们的手掌心！”
    张金龙心里很活动，就问：“现在郭团副在哪儿？”何世雄说：“老郭和李六子这一伙，先进城了。咱上头早跟城里接洽好，就等着我去呢。”又笑着说：“还不就是咱们这一把子，大大小小都是官儿啦。”张金龙喝得筋都暴起来了，他放下酒杯，说：“何团长，我这个人你也知道，说话向来是‘袖筒里人棒槌’——直出直入！要是有郭三麻子在，我反正不去！”何世雄笑着，说老郭走火决不是故意的。旁边何狗皮也劝张金龙。最后，张金龙马马虎虎答应了。临走，何世雄给了他十两大烟土，说：“这事儿你可一个字儿别露！我走的时候再叫你。”张金龙就回去了。
　　四
    小梅哄孩子睡了觉，在灯底下作活。很晚了，还不见张金龙回来；心里不满意的想：“这家伙不定又浪荡什么呢！”眼见两灯油耗干了，正要歇息，忽然瞧见张金龙喝得脸儿红扑扑的，回来了。
    小梅问他：“你到哪儿去了？深更半夜才回来！”张金龙含糊的说：“哪儿也没去。碰见个熟人，喝了两盅酒。”小梅问：“碰见谁呀？”张金龙倒在炕上，说：“碰见谁，说了你也不认得。我渴得要命，快烧点水吧！”小梅出去抱柴禾了。张金龙忙起来，掏出怀里的烟土，藏到墙上的照像框子后面；看了看，又不放心的拿下来；一时找不到好地方，就把它塞在立橱底下，一只破套鞋里。这才上炕，脱衣裳躺下了。
    小梅可多了个心眼儿，早在窗子外面瞅见了。她不动声色的抱着柴禾进来，一面烧水，一面偷偷伸手到橱底下摸；摸出个油纸包儿，暗里打开来一看，见是烟土，就顺手揣在怀里。烧开了水，她盛了一碗放在炕沿上，推醒张金龙。（未完）（附图片）
    敌人以水代兵，淹我村庄，想摧毁抗日根据地。
