Why Ping Shun Failed to Form a Great Production Upsurge

By our reporter Li Wen

Since Pingshun County fully turned to the great production movement at the end of March, it has widely publicized production policies, mobilized farmers to actively carry out activities such as repairing field edges, building embankments, and accumulating new fertilizer to improve conditions for increased production. In some villages, farmers have repaired embankment gullies that had collapsed for more than ten years, and some villages that did not have the habit of hoeing wheat and topdressing in the past have also started hoeing wheat and topdressing. However, from the perspective of the entire county, the production movement has not yet formed a major upsurge. A small number of villages have completed their production plans on time, obtaining a firm guarantee of a 10% increase in production. Most villages have failed to fully mobilize the masses' enthusiasm for increasing production due to neglecting to solve the various specific difficulties in the masses' production, resulting in the failure of most of the production plans. According to statistics from 166 villages in the county: 28 villages completed more than 80% of their production plans, 100 villages completed about 50% of their production plans, and 38 villages had spontaneous production.

What is the crux of the above situation? First of all, the understanding of the production increase policy is vague. This is reflected in the fact that leaders in various districts cannot grasp the important content of local people's production activities and truly improve production increase conditions according to the production conditions, characteristics, and seasons of their districts, but generally carry out production increase mobilization. For example, in the Seventh District, there is very little wheat, and the local people's old habit is not to fertilize valley land (in fact, it can be fertilized) and not to plow autumn land (some villages can plow), but the district leaders did not seize this issue to make a strong mobilization, resulting in two-thirds of the valley land in the district not being fertilized and very little autumn land being plowed. In the Fifth District, there is more wheat land, accounting for more than one-third of the total autumn land, but the mobilization of hoeing wheat was not seized, resulting in 9,688 mu of the 15,400 mu of wheat land in the district not being hoeed, and only 367 mu being topdressed. Many cadres, instead of seriously studying agricultural technology and helping the masses overcome difficulties in mobilizing hoeing wheat and topdressing, wavered in the "production increase policy" and abandoned leadership.

Some district and village cadres do not understand "increasing production by 10% on the existing basis." Therefore, when formulating production plans, they do not study the production conditions and foundation of their villages, but look at other villages and compare with other villages. There are even a few district and village cadres who carry out production work with the attitude of "meeting the needs of the higher authorities." In order to easily exceed the plan, they set the production plan very low. For example, An'yang Village in the Seventh District has a good production base. Last autumn, the entire village accumulated fertilizer, averaging 87 dan per mu. However, when formulating the production plan this spring, it was still set at 87 dan of fertilizer per mu. Due to the low production increase target, the village cadres relaxed their leadership and failed to fully mobilize the masses' enthusiasm for increasing production, causing the 10% increase in production to fail.

Another situation is that due to the vague concept of production increase, problems in production cannot be detected in time in daily work. Many cadres believe that "there is nothing to do after the production plan is formulated."

Secondly, the relatively serious formalism of many cadres in their work is also the main reason why the county's production movement cannot form a major upsurge. In the process of the county's production movement, the situation in many villages is: "The production plan is the plan, and the action is the action." For example, the resident district cadre and village cadre of Shibutou Village in the First District are only satisfied with the "careful and thorough" formulation of the production plan, but have no plan on how to realize it. When the county working group came to the village to check spring plowing before planting, it found that the village's plan stated: "Universally hoe wheat and strive to topdress," but in fact, less than one-third of the wheat was hoeed, and even fewer households were topdressed. The working group held a meeting of village cadres, mutual aid team leaders, and activists to specifically study how to increase production. More than half of the 40-plus people lacked confidence in increasing production, and some branch committee members even believed that "production cannot be increased at all during the wheat season."

Why is the above situation formed? Comrade Fang Jiafu, Deputy Secretary of the Second District Party Committee, self-criticized: "The production work is carried out by holding meetings to convey and explain policies, letting village cadres or the masses brew and discuss them, and asking village cadres for various figures after a few days. They don’t understand the actual situation in the village, they are driving in the air, they can’t grasp the problem, they mobilize the masses to hoe wheat, and when the masses say they are not used to it, they waver. They drift around, and the 10% increase in production fails." This is the specific situation of the production leadership of most district and village cadres.

Some cadres, when conducting investigations, have unclear or even improper purposes. Instead of seriously understanding the problems that the masses have in production and how the conditions for increasing production are improved, they are looking for examples to report their work. For example, a comrade in the Sixth District discovered in Jiepan ＠ that the entire village was still short of an average of seven dan of fertilizer per mu. However, he investigated a natural village with a good production base and a lot of fertilizer, which fueled the village cadres' complacency. He still didn't understand what difficulties the fertilizer-deficient households had, so he couldn't solve the actual problems of the masses and promote the production increase work.

Some districts hold village cadre meetings and listen to village cadres report their work, satisfying themselves with the achievements in figures, not checking the actual problems existing in the work. They blindly praise the villages with large numbers, and ignore helping the village cadres solve the specific problems in the work. Therefore, it further fuels the village cadres' formalism of not paying attention to the actual situation and pursuing numbers. Some district cadres asked village cadres to compile statistics, and a village cadre thought about it at home and filled out all kinds of production statistical tables in the village in one day.

The basic reason for the above formalism is that many cadres do not actually understand the meaning of "increasing production by an inch" and lack the enthusiasm to lead the masses to increase production. Instead, they blindly carry out production leadership to complete the production tasks assigned by the higher authorities, and separate the tasks of the higher authorities from the interests of the masses. As some cadres have checked out: "They are specific and enthusiastic about explaining tasks to the higher authorities, but their concern for the masses to increase production is empty." All day long, they are concerned and worried about how to fill out statistical tables and make summaries, but they are not wholeheartedly and tirelessly considering the problems existing in production and how to enable the masses to achieve increased production.

The Pingshun County Party Committee began to face up to the above situation, and at the joint meeting of district secretaries and district chiefs held from May 5th to 8th, it initially checked and cleared up the formalism in the work, educated and improved the cadres, and created favorable conditions for the further development of the great production movement in the future. However, how to gradually overcome formalism in the work from top to bottom, starting with the main responsible cadres at all levels, in future daily work is still an urgent problem to be solved.

　　平顺为何未能形成大生产热潮
    本报记者  力文
    平顺县自三月末全力转向大生产运动后，曾广泛宣传了生产政策，发动农民积极进行修边、垒堰、积新肥等，改善增产条件，有些村庄的农民，冲塌十来年的堰壑垒补起来了，有些村过去没有锄麦上追肥的习惯，也着手锄麦上追肥了；但从全县来看生产运动尚未形成大的热潮。少数村庄按时完成生产计划，获得增产一成的确实保证，大多数村庄由于忽视解决群众生产中的各种具体困难，未能充分发动群众增产的积极性，以致增产计划大部落空。全县一百六十六个村的统计：完成生产计划百分之八十以上者为二十八个村，完成生产计划百分之五十左右的村一百个，三十八个村生产自流。
    形成以上情况的症结在那里呢？首先是对增产方针认识的模糊。表现在各区领导上，不能根据本区的生产条件、特点、季节，抓住当地群众生产活动中的重要内容，确实改进增产条件，而是一般的进行增产动员。如七区麦很少，当地群众的旧习惯是谷地不上肥（实际上能上肥），秋地不犁（部分村庄能犁），但该区领导上却未抓紧这一问题作有力的发动，以致全区有三分之二的谷地没上肥，秋地犁的很少。五区麦地较多，为秋地总数三分之一还多，但却未抓紧锄麦的发动，以致全区一万五千四百亩麦地，尚有九千六百八十八亩未锄，上追肥的只有三百六十七亩。不少干部对于发动锄麦上追肥，不是认真研究农业技术，帮助群众克服困难，而是动摇了“增产方针”，放弃了领导。
    有的区村干部，不了解“在现有基础上增产一成”，因而在制订生产计划时，不是研究本村具有的生产条件和基础，而是看外村，和外村比较；甚至还有少数区村干部以“应付上级”的态度去进行生产工作，为着容易超过计划，把生产计划订的很低。如七区安阳村生产基础较好，去年秋天全村积肥，每亩平均已达八十七担，今春订生产计划时，却仍然订为每亩上粪八十七担。由于增产目标过低，村干部放松领导，不能充分发挥群众增产的积极性，使增产一成落了空。
    另一情况是由于增产观点的模糊，在日常工作中无法及时发现生产中的问题，不少干部认为：“制订了生产方案，便没什么可做了”。
    其次，不少干部在工作中，存有较严重的形式主义，也是该县生产运动不能形成大热潮的主要原因。在全县生产运动的进行中不少村的情况是：“生产计划是计划，行动是行动”。如一区石埠头村的驻村区干部和村干部只满足生产方案制订的“仔细周到”，却没有计划怎样去实现。当下种前县工作组到该村检查春耕，发现该村方案上写有：“普遍锄麦，争取上追肥”，实际上锄麦不到三分之一，上追肥的更是个别户，工作组召开了一个村干、互助组长、积极分子会议，具体研究如何增产，四十多人中半数以上对增产缺乏信心，有些支委还认为“麦季根本不能增产”。
    为什么会形成以上情况呢？二区分委副书记房加福同志，自我检讨出：“生产工作的进行是开会传达，讲解政策，让村干或群众酝酿讨论一番，隔几天向村干要各种数目字，对村中实际情况不了解，在空中驾着，抓不住问题，动员群众锄麦，群众说不习惯自己便动摇了，飘来飘去，增产一成便落空了。”这是当前多数区村干部生产领导的具体状况。
    有的干部在进行调查时，目的不明确，甚至不端正的，不是认真了解群众在生产中有那些问题，增产条件改进如何，而是为着汇报工作时找些事例。如六区某同志在界畔＠已发现全村每亩平均还差七担粪，他却调查了一个生产基础较好、粪土较多的自然村，助长了村干的自满情绪，对于缺粪户究竟有什么困难仍然不了解，也就无法解决群众中的实际问题，推动增产工作。
    有些区召开村干会议，听取村干汇报工作时、满足数目字的成绩，不检查工作中存在那些实际问题，对数字大的村庄，盲目的进行表扬，而又忽视具体帮助村干解决工作中的具体问题，因之就更助长了村干部不重视实际情况，追求数字的形式主义作风。有的区干让村干统计数字，一个村干在家想想，一天工夫便把村中各种生产统计表都填好了。
    产生上述形式主义的基本原因是：不少干部实际上不了解“生产长一寸”的意义，缺乏领导群众增产的热情，而是盲目的为完成上级布置的生产任务去进行生产领导，把上级任务与群众利益割裂，正如有些干部检查出：“自己对于向上级交代任务，是具体的，热情的，为群众增产是空洞的”，整天关心和发愁的是如何填统计表和搞总结，却不是全心全意孜孜不息的去考虑增产中存在那些问题，如何使群众实现增产。
    平顺县委开始正视以上情况，并在五月五日至八日召开的区书区长联席会议上，初步检查清算了工作中的形式主义，教育与提高了干部，给今后深入发展大生产运动造成有利条件。但如何在今后日常工作中，首先是从各级主要负责干部作起，自上而下的逐渐的克服工作中的形式主义，仍是急需解决的问题。
