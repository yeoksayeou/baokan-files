Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 27th: TASS, Rome: Following the victory of the strike by two million agricultural workers in Italy, the leadership of the Italian Communist Party issued a special communiqué on the 24th, declaring: "The Party leadership congratulates the farmhands and rural laborers on their victory, considering it a shining example of unity and steadfastness of the people in the struggle for legitimate demands, and a significant achievement of the people's power. The Party leadership discussed the repeated illegal actions and oppression by the police and magnates, and has authorized the Italian Communist Party members of parliament and senators to collect the necessary documents in order to expose their unconstitutional behavior in parliament and before the people."

The Secretariat of the Italian General Confederation of Labor, the Agricultural Workers' Federation, and the Farmhands' League sent letters to Italian farmhands and agricultural workers, congratulating them and emphasizing that the recent farmhands' strike, in terms of its scale and unity, was unprecedented in the history of the Italian rural labor movement. The strike's achievements, made possible by the solidarity of other working people and agricultural workers, place a responsibility on labor organizations to continue the struggle to ensure that the conditions accepted by the landowners are implemented.

To celebrate the victory of the farmhands, under the initiative of the Italian General Confederation of Labor, celebratory rallies and demonstrations will be held in all agricultural regions of Italy on the 25th and 26th.

  　总工会号召举行庆祝大示威
    【新华社北平二十七日电】塔斯社罗马讯：意大利二百万农业工人的罢工获得胜利后，意大利共产党领导机关于二十四日特为此发表公报，宣称：“党的领导机关祝贺农场雇工与农村劳动者的胜利，认为这是人民在争取正当要求的斗争中团结与坚定的光辉范例，是人民力量的重大成就。党领导机关讨论了警察与大亨们一再进行非法的行动及压迫等情况，已授权意共参众议员收集必要的文件，以便在议会中和在人民面前揭露它们的违宪行为。”
    意总工会书记处、农业工人联合会与农场雇工联盟，致函意大利农场雇工与农业工人，向他们祝贺，并着重指出：最近的农场雇工罢工，以其规模与团结来说，是意大利农村职工运动史上空前的。由于其他劳动人民与农业雇工的团结一致而达成的罢工成果，使职工组织有责任继续斗争，以便保证地主们所接受了的条件得到实现。
    为了庆祝农场雇工的胜利，在意大利总工会发起下，意大利一切农业区定于二十五、二十六两日举行庆祝大会与示威。
