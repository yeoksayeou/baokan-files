　　Changzhi Inspects White Ramie Sowing
　　People's Ideological Concerns Still Need to Be Overcome
　　[This newspaper's dispatch] Reporter Zhang Rongan reports: Changzhi County in the Taihang District is a well-known white ramie producing area. Before the War of Resistance Against Japan, the county's white ramie was sold in large cities such as Peiping and Tianjin and was an important industrial raw material. After the War of Resistance, due to the Japanese invaders' low-price purchases and the crushing of heavy taxes, production greatly decreased. Since our army liberated large cities such as Peiping and Tianjin, in order to fully supply industrial raw materials to large cities, the county arranged for the sowing of 30,000 mu of white ramie this spring. Recently, in order to ensure the completion of the sowing of this special crop, a special crop inspection team composed of ten cadres was organized on May 11 to inspect the sowing of white ramie in the first, second, third, and sixth districts. According to the inspection results, a total of more than 17,000 mu has been sown, which has not reached the expected figure. The reasons for this, in addition to the leadership's insufficient understanding of the actual situation and excessively high numerical requirements (according to the actual situation, at most 20,000 mu can be planted), some farmers still have some ideological concerns. Therefore, it has been decided to launch a white ramie sowing propaganda campaign recently to explain to the masses that white ramie is an important raw material for industrial products, and the county cooperative is responsible for selling it to the outside world. It will also be explained that planting white ramie is beneficial. According to the current market price, two jin of white ramie can be exchanged for one dou of rice. According to normal harvests, at least 100 jin of white ramie can be harvested per mu, which can be exchanged for five shi of rice. That is to say, planting one mu of white ramie is equivalent to planting five mu of millet. In addition, efforts will be made to solve the problem of seed difficulties for the masses, so that the completion of the sowing of 20,000 mu of white ramie is guaranteed to be no problem.

### 长治检查白麻播种　群众思想顾虑尚须努力克服

　　长治检查白麻播种
  　群众思想顾虑尚须努力克服
    【本报讯】记者张荣安报导：太行区长治县，是著名的白麻出产地，抗战以前该县白麻行销平、津等大城市，是重要的工业原料品，抗战以后由于日寇贱价收买和苛重捐税的摧残，产量大为降低。自我军解放平、津等大城市以后，为了充分供给大城市工业原料，今春该县曾布置全县播种白麻三万亩。最近为了保证这一特种作物的播种完成，特于五月十一日组织了十个干部的特种作物检查组，到一、二、三、六区检查白麻的播种情形。据检查结果，共已播种一万七千余亩。没有达到预期的数字。其原因除了领导上对实际情况了解不够要求数字过高以外（按实际情况顶多能种二万亩），部分农民还有些思想顾虑。因此决定最近展开播种白麻宣传，向群众说明白麻是重要工业品原料，县联社负责向外推销，并说明种白麻有利，按现在市价计算：二斤白麻可换一斗米，根据平常收成，一亩地至少收白麻一百斤，能换五石米，就是说：种一亩白麻顶种五亩谷子。此外并给群众设法解决种籽困难，这样保证完成二万亩白麻的播种不成问题。
