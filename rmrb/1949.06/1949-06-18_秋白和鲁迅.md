　　Qu Qiubai and Lu Xun
    Yang Zhihua
    The former capital of Beiping, where Qu Qiubai and Lu Xun led the cultural movement, now belongs to the people. Shanghai, where Qu Qiubai and Lu Xun lived in underground contact, has also been liberated. Qu Qiubai passed away fourteen years ago, and Lu Xun thirteen years ago, but their accomplishments are still remembered by the people of the whole country!
    Qu Qiubai was a Communist Party member, and Lu Xun was a revolutionary writer. Their spirit of cooperation and mutual learning in their work are worth learning from. Only when collectivism replaces individualism, and only when the interests of the people replace individual interests, can the bad tradition of "writers despising each other" left over from the old society be broken. They both believed that "only the emerging proletariat has a future." It was on this basis that Qu Qiubai and Lu Xun forged a close revolutionary friendship amidst dangerous storms. Their dedication of the last drop of blood for the revolution is the highest expression of this friendship.
    Qu Qiubai used Marxist-Leninist ideology to understand Lu Xun, discovered Lu Xun's greatness, and valued Lu Xun. He said: "Lu Xun, from evolutionism to class theory, from a great rebellious son and disloyal subject to a true friend and warrior of the proletarian revolution and the laboring masses, has experienced a quarter of a century of struggle from before the辛亥 Revolution until now, bringing precious revolutionary traditions to the new camp from painful experience and deep observation… These revolutionary traditions are very precious to us, especially under the light of collectivism." He called on comrades to learn from Lu Xun: "We should learn from Lu Xun, we should advance with him." On the other hand, Qu Qiubai also used his work to strengthen Lu Xun's understanding and trust in the Chinese Communist Party, and to strengthen his determination to unite with the workers and peasants.
    Lu Xun dared to associate with Qu Qiubai at the height of the White Terror. This was by no means ordinary personal affection, but class love. Thanks to Lu Xun's care and help, Qu Qiubai was not arrested in Shanghai, where he was wanted, and did not suffer hunger while in flight. He personally helped Qu Qiubai find a house and sent him books and stationery. What moved and pleased Qu Qiubai the most was obtaining foreign literary works from Lu Xun. The original works of the translations in "Hai Shang Shu Lin" were gifts Lu Xun gave him when he was on the run. Lu Xun's own works also gave Qu Qiubai great comfort. Unfortunately, due to the oppression of the reactionary Kuomintang, Qu Qiubai did not even have the freedom to read, and often the most valuable books were lost one after another because they could not be taken out of the residences that were broken into by the enemy.
    Once, Qu Qiubai and I took rickshaws and fled to Lu Xun's house at two o'clock in the night. Because the rickshaw pullers’ speeds varied, one pulled to the front door of his house, and the other pulled to the back door of his house, so that they were knocking on the front and back doors of his house at the same time. After entering the house, we deeply regretted disturbing Lu Xun and felt very uneasy. But Lu Xun calmly received us, found us another house, and once again sent us books and pens. Qu Qiubai's literary works were all produced while he was on the run. This time, he was similarly given an opportunity to write. Qu Qiubai told me that he had to complete a task this time; he wanted to write a preface to a selected collection of Lu Xun's essays. For three consecutive days, he pretended to be sick during the day, finished reading Lu Xun's essays in bed, and finished writing on the fourth night. Lu Xun was very satisfied, and from his silent eyes and relaxed smile, it was revealed that he was reviewing the process of his own ideological development, sincerely accepting Qu Qiubai's criticism of him, and forgetting that the cigarette butt was burning his fingers...
    When the two of them were together, they often felt that the night was too short. The profound friendship of the conversation ranged from politics to literature, from stories to theories, from Greece to Moscow, relaxed, pleasant, and lively. At dawn, they exchanged short works that they had read and written. Their calm combat against the enemy made Qu Qiubai forget the tense environment of being on the run.
    Although Lu Xun had never joined the Party, he believed in the Chinese Communist Party very firmly. He not only accepted the leadership of the Party, but also often put forward useful opinions to the Communist Party after his own consideration.
    Lu Xun did not want Qu Qiubai to leave. He hated that the reactionary rule could not allow Qu Qiubai to live in peace and engage in writing, just as Qu Qiubai hated that the "zombies" and "actors" did not give Lu Xun the environment to write novels. Qu Qiubai finally left Shanghai for the Soviet area at the end of December 1933. Two days before he set off, he insisted on seeing Lu Xun and returning after spending the night at Lu Xun's house. My worry disappeared in the joy of his return. He said to me: "Lu Xun and Mr. Xu slept on the floor all night and gave the bed to me." He showed his satisfaction and guilt with a smile. Since Qu Qiubai entered the Soviet area, Lu Xun often thought about his safety. Unfortunately, in March 1935, news of Qu Qiubai's arrest came from Fujian. On June 18, Qu Qiubai said goodbye to the world under the executioner's knife. This shock directly affected Lu Xun's health.
    When I recall Qu Qiubai, I inevitably recall Lu Xun. Their immortal comradeship made me deeply realize that their friendship was not built on personal life, but on the proletarian revolutionary stand, on the common cause and common qualities of Bolsheviks inside and outside the Party. Their friendship, and their contributions to the revolution, are equally worthy of our admiration and learning. June 18

### 秋白和鲁迅

　　秋白和鲁迅
    杨之华
    秋白和鲁迅领导过文化运动的故都北平，已为人民所有，秋白和鲁迅过着地下来往生活的上海亦已解放。秋白去世十四年，鲁迅去世十三年了，但是他们的事业，仍然为全国人民所追念！
    秋白是一个共产党员，鲁迅是一个革命作家，他们在事业中合作的精神和相互学习的作风，是值得我们学习的。只有集体主义代替了个人主义，只有人民大众的利益代替了个人利益的时候，才能打破旧社会遗留下来“文人相轻”的恶劣传统。他们共同认为“唯有新兴的无产者，才有将来。”就在这个基础上，秋白与鲁迅在险恶的风浪中结成了亲密的革命的友谊。他们为革命献出最后一滴血，就是这一友谊的最高表现。
    秋白以马列主义的思想方法来认识鲁迅，发现鲁迅的伟大，器重鲁迅。他说：“鲁迅从进化论到阶级论，从伟大的逆子贰臣进到无产阶级革命和劳动群众的真正友人，以至于战士，他是经历了辛亥革命以前直到现在的四分之一世纪的战斗，从痛苦的经验和深刻的观察之下，带着宝贵的革命传统到新的阵营里来…这些革命传统对我们是非常宝贵的，尤其在集体主义的照耀之下。”他号召同志向鲁迅学习：“我们应当向鲁迅学习，我们应当同着他前进。”在另一方面，秋白也以自己的工作，加强了鲁迅对中国共产党的认识和信任，加强他与工农结合的决心。
    鲁迅敢于在白色恐怖最严重的时候与秋白来往，这决不是普通的个人感情，而是阶级的友爱。由于鲁迅的关怀和帮助，秋白在被通缉的上海没有被捕，在逃难时不受饥饿。他亲自替秋白找房子，送书籍文具。最令秋白感动和喜欢的，就是从鲁迅那里获得外国文的文艺作品。“海上述林”译文的原著，是逃难时鲁迅送他的礼物。鲁迅自己的作品，也给予秋白极大的安慰，可惜的是由于反动的国民党的压迫，使秋白连看书的自由都没有，往往使他最宝贵的书来不及从被敌人破获的住所中拿出来，一批又一批的失去。
    有一次我和秋白坐了黄包车在夜里两点钟逃到鲁迅家，因为车夫的速度有快慢，一个拉到他家的前门，一个拉到他家的后门，以至同时敲着他家的前后门。进屋后我们深愧惊动了鲁迅，感觉非常不安。但是鲁迅安然的接待我们，又一次替我们找房子，又一次送书和笔给我们。秋白的文艺作品，都是在逃难时候产生的，这一次同样给了秋白一个写作的机会。秋白告诉我，这次要完成一个任务，他要写鲁迅杂感选集序言。他一连三天，白天装生病，在床上看完鲁迅杂感，第四天晚上就执笔写完了。鲁迅看了很满意，从他沉默的眼光和轻松的微笑里，露出了他在检讨自己思想发展的过程，诚意地接受秋白对他的批判，忘记了香烟头烧着了他的手指……
    他们两个在一起，往往感觉夜太短。深刻的友谊的交谈，从政治到文艺，从故事到理论，从希腊到莫斯科，轻松，愉快，活泼。天亮了，彼此交换阅读写成的短作品。他们对敌人沉着的作战，使秋白忘记了逃难的紧张环境。
    鲁迅虽然没有加入过党，但是他相信中国共产党非常坚决。他不但接受党的领导，而且常常经过自己的思考对，共产党提出有益的意见。
    鲁迅不愿和秋白离开。他痛恨反动的统治不能使秋白安居起来从事写作，如同秋白痛恨“僵尸”和“戏子”不给鲁迅写小说的环境一样。秋白于一九三三年十二月底终于离开上海到苏区去。他在动身前二天，一定要去看鲁迅，在鲁迅家过夜回来。我的担心消失在他回来的愉快中。他对我说：“鲁迅和许先生睡了一夜地板，把床让给了我。”他带着微笑，表现了他的满意和抱愧。自从秋白进苏区之后，鲁迅经常念及他的安全。不幸，在一九三五年三月间，从福建传来了秋白被捕的消息。六月十八日，秋白就在刽子手的屠刀下与世永别。这一刺激直接影响了鲁迅的健康。
    我回忆秋白，必然的回忆鲁迅。他俩的不朽的战友关系，使我深深的体会到：他们的友谊不是建立在个人生活上，而是建立在无产阶级的革命立场上，建立在党和非党的布尔塞维克的共同事业和共同品质的基础上。他们的友谊，和他们对于革命的贡献，同样值得我们的向慕和学习。　　　　六月十八日
