　　The annual meeting of the Polish-Soviet Friendship Association was held on the 12th in Katowice, Silesia. The meeting was conducted under the slogan: "Friendship with the Soviet Union, Soviet assistance, and the Soviet example are the sources of our victory."
　　Despite police terror in most parts of Latin America, news reports indicate that the peace and democracy movement led by the Communist Party and other progressive forces is still growing. One of the main forces supporting the peace and liberation movement is the Latin American Workers' Confederation, which has more than five million members. Youth, women, and intellectual groups are actively cooperating in this movement, and they are organizing the American Congress for Peace, which will be held later this year. Campaigns to defend peace and establish committees to defend peace and democracy are being carried out in Argentina, Brazil, Mexico, Venezuela, Uruguay, Colombia, Guatemala, Panama, Puerto Rico, Ecuador, and other Latin American countries.
　　Six demonstrations have taken place in Calcutta in the past week. On the night of the 15th, two demonstrations took place near Calcutta Prison in support of political prisoners on hunger strike in the prison. The West Bengal government has banned public gatherings and demonstrations in Calcutta for two weeks. On the same day, the Calcutta police arrested 50 citizens participating in the gathering on charges of so-called "incitement to riot." Five hundred workers at the "Falun Bulai" factory in Calcutta held a sit-down strike on the 16th to protest the blockade by armed police.
　　Police in Bombay, India, searched the office of the Indian Communist Party on the evening of the 16th and confiscated many books and pamphlets.
　　Bao Dai, who was declared a war criminal by the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, held an "enthronement" ceremony in Saigon on the 14th, assuming the puppet title of "King" and announcing that France had "granted" Vietnam "independence" and his "King" status. Vietnamese democrats ridiculed Bao Dai's so-called "independence" and "unity," saying they were merely synonyms for Bao Dai and his group of Vietnamese traitors selling out the interests of the Vietnamese nation. According to a Reuters report on the 13th, 6,000 high school students in Saigon went on strike on the 11th to protest Bao Dai's return to Saigon. At the same time, 400 intellectuals in Saigon signed a petition demanding recognition of the People's Government led by Ho Chi Minh.　　　　　　　　[Xinhua News Agency]
