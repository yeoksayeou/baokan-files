【Shijiazhuang Electric】The "Red May" production competition held in May and June by various state-owned enterprises and factories in Shijiazhuang City has achieved significant results. During the competition, due to the further development of enthusiasm for production by workers, efforts to improve technology, improve tools, and seek scientific work methods, the output of each factory has increased. Up to May 25th, the average daily output of the No. 1 and No. 2 flour mills, the weaving and dyeing factory, and the soap factory under Yumin Company, compared with April, increased by a minimum of 24.55 percent and a maximum of 136 percent. The quality of each factory has also improved. The competition in various departments of the Railway Bureau gradually unfolded in mid-May, and by May 21, six locomotives and 31 passenger and freight cars had been repaired, approaching the completion of one-third of the two-month competition plan. In addition, the "May 1st Competition" and "Shijiazhuang No. 1" locomotives were renovated. In the past, the locomotive factory dismantled a maximum of three boilers per month. During this competition, after workers studied and discussed and improved the labor mutual aid organization, ten units were dismantled in May. In May, the Waterworks renovated the city's water production ＠ and public faucets, and installed a street of circulating pipes, completing the main part of the annual project plan. In other factories, such as the Electric Light Company, Telephone Bureau, Coking Plant, and Daxing Yarn Factory, some units have exceeded pre-competition records. During the competition, workers in various factories constantly made new creations in the improvement of technology and tools. For example, workers in the Railway Locomotive Factory trial-produced long taps for screwing, which were eight times more efficient than manual production, which can solve the screw supply for the entire railway section under the jurisdiction of the Shijiazhuang Railway Bureau in the future. Sun Changming, an old kiln worker at the Coking Plant, used his years of experience to transform the installation of the vat brick kiln, reducing the coal burned per kiln from 5,200 jin to 3,560 jin. Due to the increased firepower, the working hours were also halved. Another significant gain in the competition was that workers actively responded to the call for economy, carefully cherished the people's property in production, and tried to search for and utilize various waste materials. For example, the Railway Locomotive Factory cleaned out 410 tons of iron and copper, which can be used by the factory until September this year. The inspection section used waste iron pipes to install wind pipes for 880 passenger and freight cars, and the water supply station re-selected coal stones that were previously considered unusable for burning, saving more than 120,000 yuan. Employees of the Electric Light Company, Telephone Bureau, and Waterworks conducted more research and used waste materials for refitting and reconstruction, saving huge sums of money.
    The reason why this competition can quickly achieve results is that each factory has the experience of the three-month production increase and loss compensation competition last winter, and has made full preparations before the competition, mobilizing employees to conduct in-depth deliberation and discussion, formulating plans for each group and even the entire factory based on individual plans, adjusting labor organization, improving and enriching the factory management committee, and some factories have also made public the Party, decided to develop the organization to absorb workers into the Party, improve and educate Party members during the competition, and the Daxing Yarn Factory also cooperated with the competition to open employee training courses. Various factories also tried their best to improve employee welfare. The Daxing Yarn Factory added a nursing room for female workers, Yumin Industrial Company solved the problems of rest rooms and drinking water, and equipped out-of-town employees with lunch break beds. Therefore, before the competition, the employees of many factories were already in high spirits. For example, the workers of Yumin Company wrote on the challenge book: "We have prepared our war horses and sharp blades, waiting for the 'May 1st' war drums to sound!"
    In addition to the above-mentioned achievements, the following problems that need to be paid attention to and corrected urgently exist in the one-month competition: (1) In some factories, workers extend working hours and do not rest at noon to strive for increased production, which harms the health of workers; (2) Many factories failed to earnestly and thoroughly promote the implementation of democratic management and the role of enriching the factory management committee in the competition; (3) The leaders should more systematically help and scientifically guide the workers' enthusiasm for inventing and improving technology in the competition.

　　石家庄各公营工厂
  　五月竞赛生产提高
  　与四月份产量相较最少的也提高四分之一
    【石家庄电】石家庄市各国营公营企业工厂所进行的“红五月”五、六两月生产竞赛已获得显著成绩。在竞赛中，由于职工进一步发挥生产积极性，努力提高技术、改良工具与求得科学化的工作方法，各厂产量均有所提高。裕民公司所属面粉一、二厂、织染厂、肥皂厂至五月二十五日止，各厂平均每日产量与四月份相较，最少的高出百分之二十四点五五，多的高出百分之一百三十六，各厂质量亦均有进无退。铁路局各部门竞赛自五月中旬逐渐展开，至五月二十一日已修理出机车六台，客货车三十一辆，接近完成两月竞赛计划中的三分之一。此外并装修了“五一竞赛号”、“石家庄第一号”两辆机车。机厂装修所过去拆吊锅炉每月最多三台，此次竞赛中经工人研究讨论，改善了劳动互助组织，五月份共拆吊十台。自来水公司于五月份装修了全市的制水＠与公用拴，并装了一条街的循环管，完成了全年工程计划中的主要部分。其他如电灯公司、电话局、炼焦厂、大兴纱厂等厂内均有部分单位超过了竞赛前纪录。在竞赛中各厂工人对技术、工具的改良不断有新的创造，其对生产有巨大贡献者，如铁路机厂工人试制出套螺丝的长板牙，效力较人工生产增加八倍，今后可解决石市铁路局所辖全路段的螺丝供应。炼焦厂老窑工孙长明运用多年经验，改造了缸砖窑的装制，使每一窑烧煤由五千二百斤减至三千五百六十斤，因火力加强，工时也缩短一半。竞赛中的另一种显著收获是，工人积极响应节约号召，在生产中认真爱惜人民财产，并尽量搜寻利用各种废弃物料。如铁路机厂曾清理出铁、铜四百一十吨，可供该厂用至今年九月，检车段用废铁管装了八百八十辆客货车的风管，给水所从新检选了从前认为不能用的煤石来烧，可节省十二万余元。电灯公司、电话局、自来水公司职工更多方研究，运用废料进行改装改制，节省了巨款。
    此次竞赛所以能迅速获得成绩，是由于各厂据有了去冬三个月增产补损竞赛的经验，并在竞赛前进行了充分的准备，发动职工深入的酝酿讨论，由个人计划而订出各股以至全厂计划，调整了劳动组织，健全与充实工厂管理委员会，有的厂并公开了党，决定在竞赛中发展组织吸收工人入党，提高与教育党员，大兴纱厂并配合竞赛开办了职工训练班，各厂并尽量注意改善职工福利，大兴纱厂为女工增建了喂奶室，裕民实业公司解决了休息室、喝水等问题，并为外宿职工设备了午睡床位，故在竞赛前很多厂的职工已情绪高涨，如裕民公司的工人在挑战书上写着：“我们已经把战马、利刃准备妥当，专等‘五一’的战鼓一响！”
    在一个月的竞赛中除获得上述成绩外，还存在着以下急待注意纠正的问题：（一）在有些厂内，工人用延长工作时间、中午不休息等来争取增加生产，损害了工人健康；（二）对贯彻民主化管理及在竞赛中充实工厂管理委员会的作用，不少厂未能认真深入推行；（三）对工人在竞赛中的发明创造，积极研究改进技术的热情，领导上应更有计划的予以帮助，并加以科学的指导。
