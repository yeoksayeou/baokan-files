    [Taiyue Telegraph] The masses in Yangyi, Zhoubi and other villages in the first district of Yangcheng County, taking advantage of the gap after sowing, are organizing the construction of water storage ponds to prepare for large-scale water storage to prevent drought. Yangyi Village held a mass meeting specifically to study the issue of building water storage ponds. Everyone believed that this was the best way to prevent drought. The next day, Guo Tianwang, Guo Xiaosi and others started construction. Guo Zaolai and others, because they did not have time, even paid six dou of rice to hire people to build them. In order to save labor in carrying water, everyone built the water storage ponds next to the fields. The village has now newly built twelve water storage ponds and repaired twenty old ones. On average, each water storage pond can store 160 dan of water, for a total of more than 5,000 dan, which can be used to plant more than 200 mu of crops. At the same time, the village has also repaired twelve broken toilets and built four new toilets, which can store a total of 1,650 dan of manure. Under the influence of Yangyi Village, Dongheshan and other villages have also started to build water storage ponds. Guo Farong's team of seven people built a water storage pond that can hold more than 3,000 dan of water. The Zhoubi Village in the fourth district is preparing to build three new water storage ponds and repair ten old ones.
    [Jinan Telegraph] To ensure the healthy growth of cotton seedlings, Xin County is digging wells to water them. After the county deployed the seedling protection work in mid-May, the Zhongmuwa District of the fourth district dug eighty wells in eight days, of which forty had abundant water sources, each yielding nearly 100 dan of water per day. The entire district has planted 650 mu, and 600 mu have been watered. The cotton seedlings in Zhifang Village have been watered once, and some are being watered a second time. When the cotton seedlings first emerged from the soil, they were attacked by drought and wind and were withering. Farmers generally had no confidence in digging wells to protect the seedlings, thinking, "If it doesn't rain, what's the use of relying on people to water them!" At that time, party members and cadres in each village guided the farmers to recall the successful experience of fighting drought in 1943, and strengthened their confidence in fighting the drought to the end. Qin Yun'an, an old farmer in Zhifang, said, "It was not easy to plant the seedlings, no matter how much effort it takes, we have to water them to keep them alive!" Seventy-three farmers in the village immediately participated in digging wells and watered fifty mu of cotton seedlings in two days.
    [Suimeng Telegraph] The counties in eastern Suiyuan are actively fighting against drought, building a large number of canals to facilitate timely sowing. In Nanzifang and other five villages in Liang County, one large canal and four branch canals have been newly opened, and thirteen old canals have been repaired in fourteen days, which can irrigate 15,000 mu of land. With the help of our district's cadres, the villages in the Fujia Village area of ​​Jining formed a water conservancy committee by administrative village, and each natural village set up a water conservancy commissioner and water conservancy team, mobilizing all the masses, and rushing to repair an old canal 15 li long in ten days. Fourteen natural villages have irrigated more than 2,000 mu of land. Under this influence, the water conservancy committees of Shaqquan and other three administrative villages also led the masses to start repairing old canals and determined the method of irrigation. Pulu and other three villages in the first district of Fengzhen have repaired old canals, turning 420 mu of dry land into irrigated land, and are now sowing. Xinghe is also renovating old canals.

    【太岳电】阳城一区阳邑、周壁等村群众，趁下种完毕的空隙，组织打水囤，准备大量蓄水，预防旱灾。阳邑村曾召开群众大会，专门研究了打水囤问题，大家认为这是防早的最好办法。第二天就有郭天旺郭小四等开始动工，郭早来等因为自己没工夫，还出了六斗米请人给自己打。为了担水省工大家都把水囤打在地边上。该村现在已经新打成了十二个水囤，修好了二十个旧水囤，平均每个水囤能蓄水一百六十担，共能蓄水五千多担，能点种庄稼二百多亩。同时该村还补修了破厕所十二个，新打厕所四个，共能蓄大粪一千六百五十担。在阳邑村的影响下，东河山等村也开始进行打囤，曹法荣一组七个人，就打了能盛水三千多担的一个水囤。四区周壁村准备打三个新水囤，修理十个旧水囤。
    【冀南电】保证棉苗肥壮生长，莘县掘井浇苗。该县五月中旬布置保苗工作后，四区中牟瓦小区八天挖井八十眼，其中有四十眼水源旺盛，每眼每天出水近百担，全小区点种六百五十亩，已浇过六百亩。纸房全村棉苗普浇一遍，有的正在浇二遍。当棉苗刚出土时，被旱、风侵袭，枯黄欲死，农民对挖井保苗多无信心，认为“天不下雨，光靠人浇顶啥事！”当时各村党员干部即引导农民回忆三十二年抗旱的成功经验，坚定了与旱灾斗争到底的信心。纸房老农秦云安说：“好容易点上苗，不管费多大劲，也得浇活它！”该村农民就有七十三人立即参加掘井，两天浇了五十亩棉苗。
    【绥蒙电】绥远东部各县，积极向旱灾作斗争，大量修水渠，以便按时播种。凉县南房子等五村，在十四天内已新开大渠一道、支渠四道，并修补旧渠十三道，共可浇地一万五千亩。集宁富家村一带村庄，在我区干部帮助下，行政村组成水利委员会，各自然村设水利委员、水利小组，动员了全体群众，在十天内把十五里长的一道旧渠赶修好。十四个自然村已浇地二千多亩。在此影响下，沙泉等三个行政村水利委员会，也领导群众动工修补旧水渠，并确定了浇地办法。丰镇一区铺路等三村已修理了旧水渠，把四百二十亩旱地变成水地，现正播种。兴和也正在整修旧渠。
