Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 7th: A dispatch from Budapest: The Executive Committee meeting of the World Federation of Democratic Youth, which opened here on May 28th, concluded on the evening of the 3rd. The meeting issued a declaration calling on the youth of the world to resolutely support and implement the resolutions of the World Congress of Supporters of Peace. The meeting heard and discussed the report by World Federation of Democratic Youth Chairman Bóérson on "The Achievements of the World Congress of Supporters of Peace and the Activities and Tasks of the World Federation of Democratic Youth," as well as the report by World Federation of Democratic Youth Secretary Kirkham on the preparations for the International Youth Day. Bóérson pointed out in his report that most of the previous activities of the World Federation of Democratic Youth were for the purpose of defending peace and exposing instigators of war. At present, the task of the Youth Federation is to strive for victory in the cause of peace. The Youth Federation should do everything possible to mobilize broader masses of people to fight for peace. For the World Federation of Democratic Youth, just as important as the struggle to win peace is the struggle for democracy, for national independence, and for better living conditions for young people. Kirkham stated: International Youth Day is scheduled to be held in Budapest from August 14th to August 28th. The program includes performances by non-professional youth and student artists, sports competitions, competitions for singers, musicians, painters, and choirs; a song competition prepared by the World Student Union; and the 10th International University Summer Sports Competition with the participation of 1,500 student athletes. At that time, there will also be a Unity Day for Youth Fighting for National Freedom and Independence; a conference of outstanding cultural workers from around the world invited to participate in the Youth Congress will be arranged; the World Student Union will specially arrange student evening parties; and exhibitions of the World Federation of Democratic Youth, the World Student Union, and youth organizations of various countries will be held during the festival. The slogan of the festival is "Youth, Unite in the Struggle for Lasting Peace, Democracy, National Independence, and a Bright Future!" Kirkham stated that the youth and students of all countries in the world have begun to actively prepare for this festival. In addition, the meeting decided to send a delegation from the World Federation of Democratic Youth, led by Secretary Williams, to Milan to attend the World Federation of Trade Unions Congress.
