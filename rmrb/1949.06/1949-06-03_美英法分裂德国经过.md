The Process of the US, Britain, and France Splitting Germany
	Ding Ming

Vyshinsky pointed out in his speech at the Foreign Ministers' Conference on the 25th that the US, British, and French Foreign Ministers, in their speeches on the 24th, all admitted that the principles stipulated in the Potsdam Agreement bound them and their governments' policies toward Germany. However, they omitted the very important principle of economic and political unity of the Potsdam Agreement, although this issue was precisely on the agenda of the Foreign Ministers' Conference and was precisely what the Foreign Ministers' Conference should be dealing with.

Why did the US, British, and French Foreign Ministers omit talking about the economic and political unity of Germany? On the one hand, they were unwilling to follow the principles stipulated in the Potsdam Agreement to establish a unified, democratic, and independent Germany; on the other hand, they had already begun to implement a policy of splitting Germany in violation of the Potsdam Agreement. This is because the Germany they wanted was a Germany that preserved reactionary forces, a Germany that became a colonial appendage of US and British monopoly capital, and an economic and political base for US and British aggression against the Soviet Union and the new democratic countries.

It is precisely for this reason that the Western German occupation authorities, beginning on January 1, 1947, have been implementing a series of reactionary policies aimed at splitting and dismembering Germany:

January 1, 1947: The US-British agreement on the economic merger of the two occupation zones began to be implemented. This agreement violated the Potsdam Agreement, hindered the economic and political unity of Germany, and marked the beginning of the four powers' splitting of Germany.

On the 7th of the same month, the US and British commanders unilaterally announced the preservation of Law No. 56 of the Kater, which violated Paragraph 12 of the Potsdam Agreement, allowing German Konzerns, trusts, and other monopolistic economic organizations to be preserved.

On April 17, the US, Britain, and France concluded an agreement on the export and distribution of Ruhr coal, disregarding the interests of the Soviet occupation zone, which was inconsistent with the decision to regard Germany as an economic whole.

In May, Clay (former US military governor in Germany) and Robertson (former British military governor in Germany) signed an agreement to make the cooperation between the US and British occupation zones even closer. The economies of the two occupation zones were more closely integrated to allow US monopoly capital to further strengthen its control. For this purpose, a legislative economic committee with enormous power, acting as a US-British puppet, was established in June, along with an administrative committee to enforce the decrees of the Economic Committee.

In January 1948, the US and British authorities further decided to reorganize the administrative bodies of the joint occupation zone, expanding the Economic Committee, which existed as a lower house, and establishing a 16-member upper house that could veto all decrees of the lower house (Economic Committee), establishing the Supreme Court of the joint occupation zone and establishing the German State Bank. This meant that the US and British authorities had taken new steps to split Germany and establish a West German separatist state.

From February to June, the United States, Britain, and France (with the participation of the Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg) held separate meetings on German issues in London. The meeting resolved to establish a West German state, convene a puppet parliament, and formulate a separatist constitution, that is, to complete the splitting and dismemberment of Germany; to undermine the conclusion of a peace treaty with Germany; to subordinate the German economy to US and British monopoly capital; and to enable US and British monopoly capital to occupy a dominant position in the Ruhr industry.

In March, the Allied Control Council for Germany and the Allied Control Council for Berlin both ceased to function because the US, British, and French representatives refused to act in accordance with the principles of the four countries' decision on the Control Council.

On June 18, the US, British, and French authorities implemented a separate currency reform, that is, issuing new currency in the western zones and special currency (B-Mark) in the western sectors of Berlin, attempting to undermine the economy of the Soviet occupation zone in Germany and split the economy of Berlin.

On September 1, the "Bonn Parliamentary Council" (also known as the Constitutional Assembly), manufactured by the US, Britain, and France, met to carry out the work of formulating a reactionary constitution.

On October 18, the Western Three Occupation Zones authorities signed a foreign trade merger agreement, giving the United States more strict control over the foreign trade of the Western occupation zones.

On December 5, in order to consolidate the split of Berlin and maintain the reactionary organization of the City Council, the Western occupying authorities rejected the Soviet proposal to hold free and democratic elections in the entire city of Berlin without interference from the occupying authorities, and conducted a separatist pseudo-election under coercion and terror.

On December 28, the Second London Conference agreement announced the establishment of the Ruhr International Control Bureau and the Military Security Board, and stipulated that steel production in the US and British occupation zones would reach 10.7 million tons per year.

On January 17, 1949, the US, Britain, and France again held a "Occupation Statute" conference in London. On the same day, the US, British, and French military governments issued a joint statement on the establishment of the so-called "Military Security Board."

On March 21, the US, British, and French authorities prohibited the circulation of German Marks in the Soviet occupation zone in West Berlin. This was another political plunder of the German people since the currency reform on June 18 last year.

On April 8, the US, Britain, and France reached an agreement on the "Occupation Statute" for West Germany, attempting to replace the peace treaty with Germany, to control West Germany for a long time, and to permanently colonize West Germany. On the same day, the US, Britain, and France announced that they had reached an agreement on the following issues: abolishing the dismantling of German factories, lifting the bans and restrictions on German industry, and establishing the Ruhr International Control Bureau.

On the 26th, the US, Britain, and France announced an agreement on the organization and procedures of the Western German "High Commission," which replaced the Allied Control Council.

On May 6, the US-British puppet "Bonn Parliamentary Council" passed a resolution to establish a West German provisional government and approved the "Bonn Constitution." On the 12th, the US, British, and French governors approved the "Bonn Constitution." On the 14th, the US, British, and French military governors in Germany signed the so-called "Autonomy Statute" for West Berlin. This is a disguised "Occupation Statute." It is another proof of the attempt to occupy West Berlin forever and deny the sovereignty of the German people. On the 18th, Truman appointed McCloy as the High Commissioner to Germany. The French government has also appointed Poncet as the High Commissioner to Germany. On the 23rd, the "Bonn Constitution" came into effect.

From the materials listed above, we can see that the US, British, and French authorities have consistently implemented a policy of splitting and dismembering Germany for the past two and a half years. Moreover, this splitting activity has become more and more intense. It began with the "economic merger of the US and British occupation zones," followed by economic splitting measures of turning two occupation zones into three - the US, British, and French authorities' agreement on the export and distribution of Ruhr coal. Later, the US and British occupation zone authorities expanded from economic splitting activities to political dismemberment, that is, the decision of the US and British authorities in January last year to establish and reorganize the management organization of the joint occupation zone, establish the Supreme Court of the joint occupation zone, and establish the German State Bank. Soon, the French authorities also participated in this splitting activity from the economic to the political - from February to June, the Western three countries (with the participation of the Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg) held a London conference and decided on the steps to complete the splitting of Germany. Later, the splitting behavior of the US, British, and French authorities was concentrated in the formulation of the "Occupation Statute" and the "Bonn Constitution." The "Occupation Statute" can be said to provide a legal basis for the splitting activities of Western countries. They want to replace the peace treaty with Germany with the "Occupation Statute," so that they can control West Germany for a long time, and "legalize" their transformation of West Germany into an appendage of US and British monopoly capital. And the "Bonn Constitution" is the basis for the establishment of the West German state.

Contrary to the policy of the US, Britain, and France to split Germany, the Soviet Union resolutely abides by the principles of Yalta and Potsdam regarding the economic and political unity of Germany. At the two Foreign Ministers' Conferences in Moscow and London, the Soviet Union has proposed suggestions for the establishment of a unified Germany more than once, but each time it has been rejected by the US-British group that deliberately split Germany. Even at this Foreign Ministers' Conference, the Soviet representative also proposed ways to rebuild Germany, but still did not receive the consent of the representatives of the Western three countries. This is why the German unification issue has not been correctly resolved until now.

The German people are resolutely in favor of democratic unification. From May to June last year, 13 million people in the eastern and western occupation zones signed a request for a referendum on the German unification issue. At the Third Congress of the German People's Congress on May 29, the call for the establishment of unification and the conclusion of a just peace treaty, as well as the recent movement of the entire German people to establish a unified Germany, all prove that the Soviet Union's proposal is in line with the will and requirements of the German people.

　　美英法分裂德国经过
    丁明
    维辛斯基二十五日在外长会议上的演说，指出：美英法外长在二十四日的演说中，都承认波茨坦协定所规定的原则约束着他们和他们的政府的对德政策。可是，他们却略过了经济和政治统一这非常重要的波茨坦协定的原则，虽然排在外长会议当前的议程上的正是这个问题，外长会议应该处理的也正是这个问题。
    美英法外长为什么略过德国经济与政治统一而不谈呢？一方面，他们不愿遵照波茨坦协定所规定的原则，建立统一、民主、独立的德国，另一方面，他们早已开始执行违反波茨坦协定的分裂德国的政策。这是因为他们所要的德国、是一个保存反动势力的德国、和成为美英垄断资本殖民地附庸的德国，及美英侵略苏联和新民主国家的经济政治基地的德国。
    正是由于这种原因，西部德国占领当局从一九四七年一月一日开始，便执行着分裂和肢解德国的一系列反动政策：
    一九四七年一月一日美英两占区经济合并协定开始执行，这一协定违背波茨坦协定，妨害德国经济、政治统一，标志着四方国家分裂德国的开始。
    同月七日，美英司令官片面的公布了保存卡迭尔的第五十六条法律，这一法律是违背波茨坦协定第十二款的，使德国的康采恩、托辣斯和其他垄断性的经济组织得以保存。
    四月十七日，美英法三占区不顾苏占区的利益，缔结了鲁尔煤的输出和分配协定，而这又是不符合应将德国视为一个经济整体的决定的。
    五月克莱（前德境美军政府总督）与罗伯逊（前德境英军政府总督）签订一个使美英联合占领区更加密切合作的协定。使两个占领区的经济更加密切地结合起来，以便美国垄断资本更加加强它的控制力。为此目的，一个作为美英傀儡的、有庞大权力的立法性的经济委员会在六月建立起来了，同时并建立了执行经委会法令的行政委员会。
    一九四八年一月间，美英当局更决定改组联合占领区的管理机构，即将作为下院而存在的经委会扩大，并成立十六人组成的上院，这个十六人的上院可否决下院（经委会）的一切法令，建立联合占领区的最高法院和成立德国州银行。这意味着美英当局采取了分裂德国和成立西德分裂国家的新步骤。
    二月至六月，美英法三国（荷比卢参加），在伦敦单独召开有关德国问题的会议。会上决议成立西德国家，召开傀儡议会，制订分裂宪法，也就是要完成分裂和肢解德国；破坏对德和约的缔结；使德国经济从属于美英垄断资本的目的；使美英垄断资本在鲁尔工业中占据统治地位。
    三月，德境盟国管制委员会及柏林盟国管制委员会均因美英法代表拒绝按照四国关于管委会的决定的原则行事，而中止工作。
    六月十八日，美英法当局实行了单独的货币改革，即在西区发行新币，在柏林西区发行特种货币（Ｂ记马克），企图破坏德境苏占区的经济和分裂柏林的经济。
    九月一日，美英法一手制造的“波恩议会委员会”（又称制宪会议）开会，进行制订反动宪法的工作。
    十月十八日，西方三占区当局对外贸易合并协定签字，使美国更严密地控制西方占领区的对外贸易。
    十二月五日，西方占领当局为巩固柏林的分裂和保持市议会这个反动组织，拒绝了苏联所提不受占领国当局干涉，在柏林全市举行自由民主选举的建议，而在威逼和恐怖下进行分裂的伪选。
    十二月二十八日，第二次伦敦会议协定，宣布将成立鲁尔国际管制局、军事安全局，并规定美英占领区钢产年达一千零七十万吨。
    一九四九年一月十七日，美英法三国在伦敦又举行“占领法规”会议。同日，美英法三国军政府发表成立所谓“军事安全局”的联合声明。
    三月二十一日，美英法当局禁止苏占区的德国马克在西柏林流通。这是从去年六月十八日币改后，对德国人民的又一次政治掠夺。
    四月八日，美英法三国对西德“占领法规”获得协议，企图以此代替对德和约，长期控制西德，并使西德永久殖民地化。同日，美英法宣布对下列问题已获得协议：取消拆卸德国工厂、解除对德国工业的禁止与限制，成立鲁尔国际管制局等。
    二十六日，美英法公布代替盟国管制委员会的西德三国“高级委员会”的组织与程序的协议。
    五月六日，美英傀儡“波恩议会委员会”通过成立西德临时政府的决议，并批准“波恩宪法”。十二日，美英法三国总督批准“波恩宪法”。十四日，德境美英法军事总督签署柏林西区的所谓“自治法规”。这是变相的“占领法规”。是企图永远占领西柏林及否认德国人民主权的又一证明。十八日，杜鲁门任命麦克洛埃为驻德高级专员。法国政府亦已委任庞赛为驻德高级专员，二十三日，“波恩宪法”生效。
    从上面所列举的材料，我们可以看出美英法当局在两年半以来，始终不渝地执行着分裂和肢解德国的政策。而且，这种分裂的活动，一步紧似一步，首先是由“美英两占区的经济合并”开始，接着由两个占领区变为三个占领区的经济上的分裂措施美英法三国当局关于鲁尔煤的输出和分配协定。后来，美英两占区当局又由经济上的分裂活动，扩大到政治上的肢解行为，就是去年一月美英当局成立了改组联占区的管理机构，建立联占区最高法院和德国州银行的决定。不久，法国当局也参加了这种由经济到政治的分裂活动——二月到六月西方三国（在荷比卢参加下）举行了伦敦会议，决定了完成分裂德国的步骤。后来，美英法三国当局的分裂行为则集中表现于“占领法规”与“波恩宪法”的制订上。“占领法规”可以说是要使西方国家的分裂活动得到合法的依据。它们要把“占领法规”代替对德和约，以“占领法规”来使它们长期控制西德，使它们变西德为美英垄断资本的附庸“合法化”。而“波恩宪法”则是为建立西德国家的张本。
    与美英法三国分裂德国的政策相反，苏联坚决遵守雅尔塔和波茨坦关于德国经济、政治统一的原则。苏联在莫斯科和伦敦两次外长会议上，不止一次地提出过建立德国统一的建议，但每一次都被蓄意分裂德国的美英集团所拒绝了。就在这次外长会议上，苏联代表也提出了重建德国的办法，但仍没有得到西方三国代表的同意。这就是德国统一问题，直到现在还没有获得正确解决的原因。
    德国人民是坚决主张民主的统一的。去年五月至六月一千三百万东西占领区人民签名要求复决德国统一问题，五月二十九日德国人民代表大会第三届大会上，要求建立统一和缔结公正和约的呼声以及近来全德国人民要求建立统一的德国的运动，在在证明了苏联的主张是符合于德国人民的意志和要求的。
