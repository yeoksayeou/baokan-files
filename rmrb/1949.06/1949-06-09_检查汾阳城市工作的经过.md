　　Review of Fenyang City Work
　　[This Newspaper’s Dispatch] The inspection of urban work and the correction of deviations based on the spirit of the Second Plenary Session of the Party has yielded good experience in the Fenyang urban work inspection led by the Second District Committee of the CCP Jinzhong. The city was liberated in July of last year, and in nearly a year, it has achieved many successes. Industry and commerce have increased, and consumption industries harmful to the national economy and the people's livelihood have been greatly reduced. Industries such as textiles and transportation have developed more than before. The number of workers at the Kunlun Match Factory has increased from 14 before liberation to 110, and the output has increased from the original three boxes per day to sixteen boxes per day (240 packs per box). The number of transport carts has increased from more than 20 to more than 50, and the number of freight yards has increased from 42 to 55. All eleven jewelry stores have been converted to other businesses. The number of 36 factories manufacturing snowflake essence has been reduced to 12. All original primary and secondary schools have been restored, and organizational work has been carried out for students, the poor, and faculty members.

　　Several Manifestations of Right-Leaning Deviations
　　However, due to insufficient attention to urban work by the leadership (county, Chengguan Municipal Party Committee, and district state-owned banks and trade departments), especially due to the lack of clarity regarding the Party's general line and general policy in the cities, right-leaning deviations have occurred. This is manifested in the development of urban production, blindly pursuing prosperity, protecting and developing industry and commerce in a general way, failing to distinguish between industry and commerce, production and consumption, and private and state-owned enterprises (Editor's note: This kind of self-criticism is correct. We must first support state-owned enterprises, and at the same time, we must also support private industry. We should also support commerce that is beneficial to the national economy and the people's livelihood.), abandoning the management of the market and the struggle against profiteers. Especially from the initial liberation to November of last year, banks allocated 6% or 7% of the total amount of loans to industrial production, and the rest were lent to commerce. A butcher shop could receive a loan, but the farm tool iron factory in Guandao Village, one mile north of the city, could not receive a loan because it could not repay the loan on time. Individual speculators obtained loans from the state bank and then bought grain from the state-owned trading company Yu丰厚 (which was selling grain at the time to stabilize grain prices), speculating and profiting from it. Yu丰厚 also purchased grain and cotton through private merchants' freight yards and grain stores, and the quality was very low (individual grain merchants mixed bad rice, and half of the 200,000 catties of cotton purchased in southern Shanxi was bad). The county government stored preferential grain for honorary soldiers in private grain stores, and the grain merchants used this grain for speculation. There were more than 30 speculators in the city (the so-called "running contracts") who specialized in speculation and arbitrage during price fluctuations, and they were not given timely, appropriate, and effective treatment. Cui Guang, a "running contract" person, hoarded cloth when he saw that the trade company had no cloth, and sold it at a high price when the price of cloth rose. The failure to implement the national unified weights and measures also gave speculators loopholes. Many inns engaged in illegal activities such as trading gold and silver, gambling, and introducing prostitutes. Individual public stores did not cooperate closely with state-owned companies to fight against profiteers, and also engaged in speculation and profiteering. The "cooperatives" that Yan's bandits forced the masses to establish in the past were not thoroughly reformed.

　　Deviation from Neglecting Workers' Work
　　The line of urban work did not rely on the working class, but only on some upper-level figures in industry and commerce and old Yan's puppet personnel. After liberation, the "Federation of Industry and Commerce," "Poor People's Group," and street offices were established, but no trade union was established. There were more than 700 workers in the city, accounting for 3.5% of the total population. Their welfare undertakings had not been protected for a long time, and their political and class consciousness had not been improved as they should have been. Therefore, incidents of capitalists dismissing, beating, and scolding workers and deducting wages occurred continuously. The capitalists of the Dongguan Textile Factory used the excuse of paying taxes to deduct workers' wages. Tian Yongting, the owner of the Yongji Factory, slapped Ren Tining, a worker, twice. Some workers said, "We have no place to speak." There was also neglect of building the Party in this class (Note: It is impossible to talk about building the Party before the working class has been fully mobilized.). Among the 31 newly developed party members in the city, only three were manual laborers. The leadership also did not allocate worker cadres. Because the basic masses did not have real power, local grain was controlled by a small number of people. When discussing market prices and other issues in business households, the local leadership rarely sent cadres to participate. The trade company, which was a natural standing committee member of the Federation of Industry and Commerce, also sent people to "attend as observers," abandoning leadership. As a result, the association issued business licenses indiscriminately and even deceived workers.

　　Right-Leaning Manifestations in Public Security Work
　　In public security work, the Public Security Bureau simply changed the deputy heads of each neighborhood to security census takers. Among them, Dong Yunshan was a "plainclothes" during the Japanese occupation and the captain and deputy head of the security police during Yan's bandit regime. Secret societies and other feudal superstitious organizations were not registered and disbanded, and continued to operate as before. The announcement of the North China People's Government dissolving secret societies was not posted in the city. In culture, education and propaganda, some cadres adopted a conciliatory attitude towards the backward thinking of some old teachers, and long-term neglect of student mass work. Many places still had remnants of Japanese and Yan's reactionary slogans, and Yan's bandit "memorial tower" had not been demolished for a long time.

　　Problems in County and City Leadership
　　In addition to the lack of clarity in the direction of urban work, there was also neglect and disunity of forces in the leadership, and a purely administrative style in the way of working. In December of last year, the mayor of Fenyang (who was also a member of the municipal party committee) who attended the first urban work conference of the Taiyuan Municipal Party Committee did not convey it to the county party committee. Various departments managed their own affairs, shirked responsibility, did not understand each other, and the trade company and other county committees led the county committee and other municipal committees to work. The municipal party committee and the municipal government were only busy with burdening, equipment, and other affairs, and did not go deep into the masses to carry out work. To this day, there is still no detailed and accurate complete investigation of this small city.

　　Correct Deviations and Conduct Experiments
　　Based on the characteristics of Fenyang City, develop industrial and handicraft production, such as agricultural tools, water mills, etc., and plan to establish a native product sales cooperative in the future. Because Fenyang is a distribution center for goods from east and west, it is necessary to strengthen the management and leadership of merchants, transactions, inns, finance, and markets. The following steps will be taken: first, concentrate relevant urban work cadres and urban work cadres from various counties for training, and conduct urban surveys at the same time, and then use Fenyang as a base point to conduct experiments. On May 7, a training class for more than ten urban work cadres officially began. Worker work has also begun. In order to clarify the importance of worker work ideologically to the whole Party, all agencies stationed in Fenyang conducted ideological self-criticism under the leadership of the Party branch on the May 1st Labor Day. On the same day, after participating in the May 1st Labor Day meeting, all agencies visited workers separately. The municipal party committee also convened a forum for workers at the same time to understand worker issues. On April 25, the preparatory committee of the city's trade union was established, and on April 30, the trade union of the match factory was officially established. In order to strengthen worker education, the cultural center established a worker literacy night school, with the participation of more than ten male and female workers.

### 检查汾阳城市工作的经过

　　检查汾阳城市工作的经过
    【本报讯】依据党的二中全会精神检查城市工作纠正偏向，这在中共晋中二地委领导的汾阳城市工作检查中取得很好经验。该城于去年七月解放，将近一年已获得不少成绩，工商业增加，有害于国计民生的消费业大为减少，纺织运输等业则较前发达。昆仑火柴工厂工人由解放前的十四人增至一一○人，产品已由原每天三箱增至日产十六箱（每箱二百四十包）。运输大车由二十余辆增至五十余辆，货栈四二家增到五十五家。原十一家首饰铺，已全部转业。原三十六家制造雪花精的减至十二家。原有中小学全部恢复，此外还进行了学生贫民教职员等组织工作。
  　右倾偏向的几种表现
    但由于领导上（县、城关市委及分区国营银行、贸易部门）对城市工作的重视不够，特别是由于对党在城市的总路线总政策思想的不明确，曾发生右倾偏向。表现在发展城市生产问题上，盲目的追求繁荣，笼统的保护与发展工商业，工业和商业不分，生产与消费不分，私营与国营不分（编者按：这样的检讨是正确的，我们要首先扶持国营企业，同时还必须扶持私人工业，对于有益国计民生的商业也应予以扶持），放弃对市场的管理和对奸商的斗争。特别是在初解放至去年十一月份中，银行在发放贷款中，贷给工业生产的占全部贷款总额的百分之六、七，余皆贷给商业。一个肉铺可领到借款，而城北一里之官道村农具铁厂，因无法按期归还贷款却没有领到。个别投机商人从国家银行领下贷款，又从国营贸易公司裕丰厚买下粮食（当时为稳定粮价而抛售粮食），从中投机渔利。裕丰厚又通过私商货栈和粮店收购粮食、棉花，质量很低（个别粮商羼坏米，在晋南买的二十万斤棉花中有一半坏花）。县府将荣誉军人优待粮存在私商粮店中，粮商即以此粮进行投机。全城有三十多个投机商人（即所谓“跑合”的）专门在物价波动中进行投机倒把买空卖空，未给以及时的适当有效的处理。“跑合”的崔光看见贸易公司没有布时，即囤布，俟布价高涨便高价出售。没有实施国家统一的度量衡，也给奸商以投机的空子，大秤买，小秤卖。不少旅栈进行金银盗卖、聚赌、介绍妓女等不法活动。个别公营商店，没有与国营公司取得密切配合，共同向奸商斗争，也进行投机渔利。对阎匪过去强迫群众所成立的“合作社”，没有进行彻底的改造。
　　忽视工人工作的偏向
    在城市工作的路线上没有依靠工人阶级，只是依靠某些工商业的上层分子和旧的阎伪人员。解放后成立了“工商联合会”、“贫民团”、街公所，却没有建立起工会。全城共有工人七百余，占总人口百分之三·五，他们的福利事业长期没有得到保护，政治觉悟及阶级觉悟，没有得到应有的提高，资方开除、打骂工人及克扣工资事件因而不断发生。东关纺织厂资方借口交税要扣工人工资。永济工厂厂主田永亭曾打工人任体宁两个耳光。有的工人就说：“我们就没个说话处”。对于在本阶级中建党也很忽视（按：在工人阶级尚未充分发动之前建党亦谈不到），全城除火柴工厂新发展的十个党员外，在新发展的三十一个党员中仅有三个手工工人成份。领导上也没有配备工人干部。由于基本群众没有实权，地方粮掌握在少数分子手里。在商户评分讨论市场物价等问题时，该地领导上很少派干部去参加，为工商会当然常务委员的贸易公司也是派人去“列席”，放弃领导。因而该会乱发营业证，甚至于蒙蔽欺骗工人。
　　治安工作上的右倾表现
    在治安工作上，公安局曾简单的将各闾副闾长改为治安稽户员。其中如董云山系日寇时之“便衣”，阎匪时的保警中队长、副闾长。会道门等封建迷信组织未进行登记解散，仍照旧活动。华北人民政府解散会道门布告，城内没有贴出。在文化教育及宣传上，部分干部对部分旧教员的落后思想采取迁就态度，长期的忽视学生群众工作，很多地方还存在残余的日、阎反动标语，阎匪之“纪念塔”很久没有拆毁。
　　县市领导上的问题
    在领导上对城市工作除方针不明确外，还存在着忽视和力量的不统一，工作方式上的单纯行政作风。去年十二月，太原市委第一次城工会议，参加会议的汾阳市长（亦为市委委员）没有向县委做传达。各部门各管各，互相推诿，互不了解，贸易公司等县委会领导，县委等市委去作。而本市市委、市政府却只忙于负担、器材等事务工作，没有深入群众进行工作。至今对这个小城市还没有一个详细而确切的完整调查。
　　纠正偏向进行实验
    根据汾阳城市特点，发展工业手工业生产，如农具、水磨等，拟将来成立土货推销合作社。因汾阳是东西货物集散地，故要加强商户、交易、旅栈、金融、市场的管理与领导。并采取如下步骤：先集中各有关城市工作干部及各县城市工作干部训练，同时进行城市调查，然后以汾阳为基点进行实验。五月七日十余人的城工干部训练班已正式开始。工人工作亦开始进行，为使全党从思想上明确工人工作的重要，驻汾阳各机关于五一纪念日，均在党的支部领导下从思想上进行检讨，同日各机关参加五一纪念会后，分头访问工人。市委亦于同时召集工人座谈会，了解工人问题。四月二十五日成立了全市职工会筹委会，三十日火柴工厂职工会正式成立。为加强工人教育，文化馆成立工人补习夜校，参加男女工人十余人。
