  　(IX) "You talk about that? It's really true!"
    The doctor and medics came over, immediately performed surgery, stopped the bleeding, gave him two injections of cardiac stimulant, and poured some rice soup and eggs into him. Han Junting opened his eyes and understood.
    "Damn it, did they leave?" Han Junting asked:
    "They left! One was shot down!"
    "...Good!..." Only then did Han Junting tiredly close his eyes.
    The whole squad gathered around, staring blankly as the doctor and medics busied themselves applying medicine, giving injections, and wrapping bandages, asking each other:
    "Is he okay?"
    "Who knows? Look how pale his face is!"
    "That's right! I heard he lost a lot of blood!"
    "Who can withstand that!"
    "Is there anything else we can do?" Zhang Jizu asked.
    "Who knows!..."
    While they were busy, asking the doctor, the doctor didn't pay attention; everyone was very anxious. It was only after the bandaging was finished that Zhang Jizu rushed to ask:
    "Is it serious or not?"
    "It's not serious! But he lost a lot of blood! I don't even dare to look directly!"
    "Can I give him my blood?"
    "That would be great! But it has to be done after he's sent to the sanatorium!"
    Ma Ziliang and the others got a stretcher, prepared it, and put Han Junting on it. None of the nine people were left behind; they all went to carry it. Along the way, the people taking turns carrying would always speak first:
    "Come on! Let's switch!"
    "We've only walked a few steps?! No need!"
    "Okay! You've been carrying it all by yourself; won't others get to carry it?"
    "Isn't it the same no matter who carries it?"
    "Then why don't you let me carry it?"
    Going uphill and downhill, they called out to each other: "Be careful!" Their steps were small and their bodies steady, more careful than carrying a new bride in a sedan chair. When they arrived at the sanatorium, they put Han Junting down, and the doctor stood over and asked:
    "Who among you can give him a blood transfusion?"
    "..." Zhang Jizu didn't understand, and paused for a moment: "You mean give the squad leader a blood transfusion?"
    "Yes!"
    "I'll give!"
    "I'll give too!"
    "I'll give! I have lots of blood!..."
    All nine people were clamoring to give. The doctor took a little blood from each of the nine people for testing, and told everyone that they would see if the blood types matched, and if they matched, it could be used. Only then did everyone have nothing to say.
    On the way back, the main topic was discussing shooting down the plane, and of course, they connected it to Squad Leader Han's bravery. Ma Ziliang thought of a sentence:
    "Comrades!" Ma Ziliang slowed his pace, as if he were about to give a speech: "You say the words 'trading a life for a life,' is that true or false?"
    "Judging from what happened today," Zhang Jizu said, "it's really true!"
    "How is it true?"
    "How is it true?" Zhang Jizu said again, "Today these four planes came with a plan to destroy us! Among the four anti-aircraft guns, Squad Leader Han's was in a high position, threatening the enemy! Without this one, the planes could boldly and casually strafe and bomb! Liu Fuzeng was wounded, but Squad Leader Han wasn't afraid at all and went up! He himself was wounded, but he still clung to the anti-aircraft gun! If he hadn't shot it down, who knows how many people would have been injured! Isn't that risking his life to save everyone's lives?"
    "You talk about that? It's really true!" The other comrades echoed.
    "Squad Leader Han is really!..." Li Zhenbang said with emotion, "Sometimes he gets stubborn, which is really hard to deal with! But when it comes to really working hard and risking his life for everyone, he really does it! Even though he's obviously nervous inside, as soon as you see his strong spirit, your heart suddenly relaxes! At times like that, you feel like he's really lovable!..."
    "Do you understand now?" Ma Ziliang said to Zhao Baohai.
    "Whether we understand or not, is that the point!"
  　(X) "We can't be like the past again!..."
    Han Junting lay in bed.
    After the blood transfusion, his body recovered quickly. Although the wound had not yet closed, his spirit was completely restored. After he passed through that period of coma, he fully understood two things: first, he had shot down an enemy plane; second, the whole squad had given him blood, saving his life.
    The first thing was a joy, and the second thing was also a joy; however, the latter joy grabbed Han Junting's rigid heart, an inseparable happiness, and an inseparable new burden. Han Junting understood in his heart: In everyday life, there were many words and actions that were unreasonable, that let down his comrades. As long as he got angry, he didn't care about anything, just to be happy for a moment!... Scolding them, suppressing them with big words... Actually, it wasn't that he didn't know, it was just that when his temper came, he didn't care! Now, he was in trouble, a matter of life and death, and everyone offered their own blood!
    "Sigh!..."
    Han Junting sighed deeply, his face very serious, his heart very heavy. His eyes looked at the things sent by the company, battalion, and soldiers: pears, apples, candy... Slowly, he raised his head again and looked ahead. He thought about what would happen after he recovered.
    "We can't be like the past again!..."
    These words were not spoken, but this thought and emotion were indeed growing in his heart. He hoped that everyone would not come to see him anymore, hoped that the wound would heal quickly, that he could return to the unit quickly, that he could do better, and that he could recover from the wrong behaviors he had already done as soon as possible.
    For shooting down the plane, the superiors issued a commendation and it was published in the newspaper. The newspaper was sent to him by the instructor and Ma Ziliang, who happily read it to him. Han Junting's face was still like an iron plate, making it difficult to determine whether he was happy or not. The instructor's and Ma Ziliang's smiles, looking at Han Junting's stiff, motionless face, read in an increasingly lower voice. In the end, the two of them also put away their smiles. The instructor asked strangely:
    "Comrade Han Junting! How are you? Not feeling well?"
    "..." Han Junting shook his head.
    "Then what's wrong with you? You should be happy, but you're not?" Ma Ziliang nudged Han Junting.
    "I'm just thinking about sealing the wound quickly so I can get out! Lying down all the time is really suffocating!" Han Junting said.
    "Then you're not deliberately faking illness!" Ma Ziliang said.
    "Rest well! Don't rush!..." the instructor said.
    "I think I really shouldn't be lying down anymore! I should do something good!..."
    Han Junting changed his medicine twice a day, and each time he changed his medicine, he looked at it carefully. The doctor always said, "It's healing really fast! Fast! It's sealing up!" Han Junting always felt that it was growing too slowly, and he asked for good medicine every day. This request continued until he was completely healed.　　　　　　　　　　　　　(May 9, 1949)

　　“落后的脑袋”（续完）

  　（九）“说那个？可真！”
    医生和卫生员过来，马上动手术，停止了流血，给他注射了两针强心剂，灌了一些米汤和鸡蛋，韩俊庭挣开了眼睛，心里明白了。
    “狗日的，走了？”韩俊庭问：
    “走啦！打掉了一架！”
    “……好！……”韩俊庭这才疲倦地合上了两眼。
    一班的全体同志都围了过来，呆呆地看着医生和卫生员忙着上药打针缠绷带，相互问着：
    “不要紧吧？”
    “谁知道？你看脸都白啦！”
    “可不是！说流了不少的血呢！”
    “横是有一小盆子！什么人经的起呀！”
    “那还有啥办法没有？”张继祖问。
    “谁知道！……”
    在正忙的时候，问医生，医生也不理；大家心里很急。好容易才算缠完了绷带，张继祖抢先问道：
    “到底要紧不？”
    “不要紧！可是血流的多！还不敢看一定！”
    “我把我的血给他点行不？”
    “那很好！得送到休养所以后才行！”
    马子亮他们弄了一付抬子，铺好了，把韩俊庭放上去，九个人一个也没剩，都跟着去抬，一路走着，总是换抬的人先说话：
    “来！换换！”
    “才走几步？！不用！”
    “行啦！你一个人都抬了，人家还抬不抬？”
    “谁抬不是一样啊？”
    “那你为啥不叫我抬？”
    上坡下岗，前后招呼着：“小心点！”步子走的又小，身板又稳，比抬新媳妇花轿还小心。到了休养所，把韩俊庭放下，医生站过来问道：
    “你们谁能给他输血？”
    “……”张继祖没听明白，怔了一下：“就是给班长输血？”
    “是的！”
    “我给！”
    “我也给！”
    “我也给！我血多！……”
    九个人都吵着要给。医生把九个人的血都留下了一点做检查，告诉大家，看血型合不合，合的就可以用。大家才没有话说。
    回来的路上，主要问题就是谈论打飞机，当然就联到韩班长的英勇，马子亮想起了一句话：
    “同志们！”马子亮把脚步放慢，好象要讲演：“你们说‘命都换的着’这话，是真，是假？”
    “要打今天这个事上看，”张继祖说：“这可真是真的！”
    “怎么是真的？”
    “怎么是真的？”张继祖又说道：“今天这四架飞机，是有计划来的，要破坏咱们！四架伊斯古，就数韩班长这架地势高，威势（胁的意思—注）敌人！要没有这架，飞机就可以大胆随便地扫射轰炸！刘福增打伤了，韩班长一点不害怕，上去了！自己又伤了，还抱着伊斯古干！要不打着他，不知要伤多少人呢！这不是拼着命换大家的命么？”
    “说那个？可真！”别的同志们附合着说。
    “韩班长这个人真是！……”李振邦感慨地说：“有时候上来个别扭劲，真让人难呛！碰着这实杀实干为大家拼命时，他也真干！明明心里直突突，一看见他那个刚强劲，心气一下子就松散了！到了这种时候，觉着他又真可爱！……”
    “这回你们也明白了？”马子亮赵宝海说。
    “明白不明白，是那末回事么！”
  　（十）“可不能再象过去！…”
    韩俊庭躺在床上。
    输血以后的身体，很快地就恢复起来，伤口虽然还没有封口，精神却完全复原了。当着他渡过了那段昏迷阶段之后，他完全明白了两件事：第一件是打落了敌人一架飞机，第二件是全班给他输了血，救活了他的性命。
    第一件事，是个欢喜，第二件事，也是个欢喜；不过，后一件欢喜却抓着韩俊庭这个古板的心，是扯不断的快活，又是扯不断的新生的负担，韩俊庭心里明白：在平日生活中，有许多言语举动，不近人情，对不住同志们，只要自己心里一上火，什么也不管，图个一时高兴！……熊过他们，拿大话压过他们……其实不是不知道，就是性子一来不管不顾！眼下，自己处在难中，性命交关，大家拿出自己的血来！
    “咳！…………”
    韩俊庭长长地吁气，脸色十分严肃，心地十分沉重。眼睛望着连部营部和战士们送来的东西：梨苹果糖……慢慢地又抬起头来，看看前边。他想到复原以后的事情。
    “可不能再象过去！……”
    这话没有吐出口来，心里确实生长着这个念头和情绪。他希望大家不要再来看他，希望着伤口赶快长好，赶快回到部队中去，赶快做得好些，提早收回已经做了的不对的行为。
    为着打下飞机这事，上级传令嘉奖，登了报。报纸由指导员和马子亮送到他那里，欢天喜地念给他听，韩俊庭听了，脸皮还是铁板一样，令人很难断定他是喜欢还是不喜欢。指导员和马子亮的笑容，望着韩俊庭的呆板的不见动作的脸色，越念声越低，到末尾，两个人也收起了笑容。指导员奇怪地问道：
    “韩俊庭同志！怎么样？不舒服？”
    “……”韩俊庭摇了摇头。
    “那你是怎么啦？该欢喜都不欢喜？”马子亮搡了韩俊庭一把。
    “我就是想着快点封口，好出去！再倒着，真蹩死人！”韩俊庭说。
    “那你也不是故意泡病号啦！”马子亮说。
    “好好休息！别急！……”指导员说。
    “我是想我实在不该再躺着！该好好办点事！……”
    韩俊庭每天换两次药，换一次药，自己仔细地看一回。医生老是说：“好的真快！快啦！封口！”韩俊庭老是觉着长得太慢，一天要求用好药。这个要求，一直到他彩好为止。　　　　　　　　　　　　　（一九四九、五、九日）
