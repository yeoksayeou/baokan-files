Xinhua News Agency, Peiping, 4th: A dispatch from the Polish Press Agency in Warsaw: "Rzeczpospolita" here, commenting on the Foreign Ministers' meeting, wrote that right-wing Western newspapers have launched a propaganda campaign advocating a "limited" agreement, and even drafted its conditions. These proposals seem to have been put forward behind the scenes at the Paris Conference. The Western countries are unwilling to expose their hostility to a comprehensive agreement, but it is very clear that they would prefer to obtain a limited "interim agreement." "Rzeczpospolita" wrote: An agreement on the German question would obviously hinder the ratification of the North Atlantic Treaty, and make it necessary to abolish the Bonn "Constitution" and the "Occupation Statute," all of which are contrary to the plans of the US and Britain. Every speech by Vyshinsky has shattered this conspiracy of the Western countries. Democratic public opinion not only agrees with his criticism of the Western countries' proposals, but also fully supports his proposals that should be the basis of a permanent comprehensive agreement.

The weekly "Świat Polska" also wrote: It is very clear that behind the scenes of the Foreign Ministers' meeting, a careful arrangement is underway. Since the agreement in New York to hold the Foreign Ministers' meeting, this arrangement has repeatedly created events that could adversely affect the work of the Foreign Ministers' meeting. During the past year, Western politicians have tried to convince the world that, in the final analysis, it is impossible to reach an agreement and establish peace in Europe. At the same time, they have tried to enforce the division of Germany and the policy of war blocs. However, the will of peace-loving countries is stronger than the authors of the war blocs imagine. Recent facts have shown how unfounded the conjecture that an agreement is impossible is, and therefore also show how unfounded the entire policy of the Western countries is.

　　波报揭露三国对外长会议阴谋
  　美英法正制造宣传妄图阻止全盘协议
    【新华社北平四日电】波兰通讯社华沙讯：此间共和报在评论外长会议时写道，西方右翼报纸已发动一种宣传运动，主张作一种“有限的”协议，甚至拟出了它的条件，这些建议似乎已在巴黎会议幕后提出。西方国家不愿暴露他们敌视全盘协议，但是，他们宁愿获得一项有限的“临时协定”，这是很清楚的。共和报写道：德国问题的协议，显然将妨碍北大西洋公约的批准，使波恩“宪法”和“占领法规”有废除的必要，而所有这些，都是与美英计划相抵触的。维辛斯基的每一次发言，都击破了西方国家的这一阴谋。民主舆论不仅表示同意他对西方国家建议的批评，并且也完全支持他所提出的应作为永久全盘协议的基础的建议。
    “斯维埃特·波尔斯卡”周刊也写道：很清楚，在外长会议幕后，正进行着一种小心的安排。自从在纽约协议了召开外长会议以后，这种安排就在累次制造可能予外长会议工作以不利影响的事情。在去年一年中间，西方政治家们试图使全世界相信，归根到底，在欧洲达到协议和建立和平是不可能的。同时，他们力图强行德国的分裂和战争集团的政策。但是，爱好和平国家的意志，较战争集团的作者们所想象者为强。最近的事实已经表明，说协议不可能的臆断是何等的无根据，因而也说明了西方国家的整个政策是何等的无根据。
