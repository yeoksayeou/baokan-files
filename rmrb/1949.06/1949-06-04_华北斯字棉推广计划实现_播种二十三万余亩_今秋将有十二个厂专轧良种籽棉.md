　　North China's Implementation of the Si Character Cotton Promotion Plan
  　Planting Over 230,000 Mu
  　Twelve Factories Will Specialize in Processing Fine Seed Cotton This Autumn
    [Our Newspaper's Report] The North China Cotton Production Improvement Office's promotion of the superior Si character cotton variety (including 34 key work counties and cities) in various cotton-producing areas of North China this year has, to date, seen all locations complete planting tasks according to plan. Specifically: The Beiping guidance area promoted fine cotton varieties on 50,066 mu in Daxing and Tongxian; the Tianjin guidance area, 40,554 mu; the Langfang guidance area, 60,315 mu; the Baoding guidance area, 17,774 mu; the Shijiazhuang guidance area, 16,853 mu; the Handan guidance area, 11,632 mu; the Linqing guidance area, 26,000 mu; the Heze guidance group, 15,515 mu; the above totals 238,709 mu of fine cotton fields planted, exceeding the original plan of 235,000 mu. The guidance areas initiated watering and concentrated sowing of the fine cotton fields starting in late April. The Beiping area also repaired the irrigation equipment in Xiaojie Village, Tongxian, using electric pumps to water over 1,500 mu of cotton fields. The early-planted cotton fields, such as those in the Beiping and Tianjin areas, have fully emerged; the emergence situation in other areas is also at 60-70%, with Tongxian, Daxing, and Fengnan counties showing the best emergence, with over half of the cotton fields achieving 100% seedling emergence. The cotton seedlings in Jinghai County suffered a wind disaster, but after launching seedling protection work, the remaining seedlings are barely sufficient. Many of the cotton seedlings in other areas that were damaged by wind, hail, and frost have been replanted, and the emergence situation is still under investigation. (Fan)
    [Our Newspaper's Report] In order to secure this year's promoted 238,709 mu of 2B cotton seeds, for the purpose of expanding fine cotton fields next year, the North China Cotton Production Improvement Office convened a meeting of cadres from various guidance areas on the 21st of last month to arrange for the establishment of ginning factories. It was decided that: one powered (diesel engine) ginning factory would be established in each of the Linqing, Handan, and Ba County fine variety areas; one electric ginning factory would be established in Shijiazhuang; the manual one in Yangliuqing would be converted to electric; the original internal combustion engine one in Nanyuan would be converted to electric; and a powered (diesel engine) ginning factory would be established in cooperation with the Promotion Society in Li County. The ginning factories will be managed uniformly by the North China Cotton Production Improvement Office, with the local government agricultural departments managing them in close combination with the supply and marketing cooperative trade departments, so that raw cotton can be supplied continuously. Flower picking and ginning will begin at the end of September. In this way, there will be twelve ginning factories ginning fine seed cotton this autumn, which will be an important impetus for cotton improvement next year. (Zang Chengyao)

　　华北斯字棉推广计划实现
  　播种二十三万余亩
  　今秋将有十二个厂专轧良种籽棉
    【本报讯】华北棉产改进处今年在华北各产棉区推广的斯字棉良种（包括有三十四个重点工作县市），截至目前，各地均已按照计划完成了播种任务。计：北平指导区在大兴、通县推广良种棉田五○、○六六亩；天津指导区四○、五五四亩；廊坊指导区六○、三一五亩；保定指导区一七、七七四亩；石家庄指导区一六、八五三亩；邯郸指导区一一、六三二亩；临清指导区二六、○○○亩；菏泽指导组一五、五一五亩；以上计有二三八、七○九亩良种棉田播了种，超过了原计划的二三五、○○○亩。各指导区的良种棉田四月下旬即起始发动了浇水突击点播。北平区还修理了通县小街村的灌溉设备，用电力机吸水浇了一千五百余亩的棉田。早种的棉田如北平区及天津区的已经出齐了苗，其余各区的出苗情形也有六、七成，以通县、大兴、丰南等县出苗最好，有一半以上的棉田得百分之百的苗。静海县的棉苗遭受了风灾，经发动保苗的工作，留下的苗还勉强够用。其他地区部分遭风雹冻灾伤害之棉苗，不少已补种，出苗情况尚待调查。（藩）
    【本报讯】华北棉产改进处为掌握今年推广出的二三八、七○九亩二Ｂ棉籽，以备明年扩大良种棉田，特于上月二十一日召开各指导区干部会议，布置设立轧花厂。决定：临清、邯郸、霸县各良种区建立动力（柴油机）轧花厂一座，石家庄设电力轧花厂一座，杨柳青人力改装电力，南苑原为内燃机改装电力，蠡县和推进社合作建立动力（柴油机）轧花厂一座。轧花厂由华北棉产改进处统一经营，当地政府农业部门管理并和供销社贸易部门紧密结合，使料棉得到源源供应。九月底开始收花、轧花。这样，今秋将有十二个轧花厂轧良种籽棉，对明年棉花改良上将是一个重要推动。　　　　　　　　　（臧成耀）
