　　Vigorously Protect Seedlings, Process and Add Fertilizer to Guarantee Increased Cotton Production This Year

After more than a month of arduous work, cotton sowing in various parts of North China, in a resolute struggle against severe drought and wind disasters, overcame various difficulties. According to preliminary estimates from materials received from various places, about 80 percent of the 13 million mu cotton planting plan in North China has been completed. The eighth special district of Central Hebei and Ningnan County in Southern Hebei have exceeded their targets. Among them, the planting of the improved cotton variety "Si" cotton, through the efforts of the designated counties and districts of the North China Cotton Production Improvement Office, has completed more than 238,000 mu, exceeding the original plan by more than 3,000 mu. From the overall task perspective, although the plan was not fully completed due to seedling difficulties, the achievements made by the people in the struggle against various disasters are indeed very commendable. These achievements will provide a preliminary guarantee for the development of the North China textile industry. In particular, the promotion of "Si" cotton has opened up a broad road for expanding cotton production next year. This is a major achievement of North China's farmers in the country's economic construction. However, this does not mean that cotton sowing this year has ended, and we can sit back and wait for a bumper harvest. We must understand that this can only be regarded as taking the first step, and we have even more arduous work to do! This means that we must continue to fight against insect pests and natural disasters such as wind and drought without the slightest slackness, ensure that cotton seedlings do not die, and further organize the masses to process and add fertilizer to ensure increased production, striving to increase the yield of existing cotton fields by 20 percent to meet the requirements of the original planned cotton output. All localities must not underestimate or ignore this work, considering it unimportant or assuming that "the masses will do it themselves" and abandon leadership. It should be recognized that this is a more arduous and complex task than organizing sowing, and it has a more direct effect on increasing production. Because cotton seedlings are different from other grains, dead seedlings cannot be replanted. The quality of cotton cultivation techniques, as well as whether the amount and type of fertilizer are appropriate, have a very close relationship with yield. The same land can increase or decrease yield by one-third to one time. To this end, the Agricultural Department of the North China People's Government and the Cotton Production Improvement Office have proposed various methods (see today's agricultural production supplement of this newspaper), and all localities must make every effort to organize the implementation of this work. In terms of improving and promoting cotton planting techniques, Renqiu and other places in Central Hebei have organized typical symposiums in various villages, absorbing good experiences and introducing and promoting them. This method is worth learning from in all localities. Agricultural technicians in various localities should provide planned and focused guidance. Cadres at all levels should quickly learn these experiences, strengthen leadership, and work with agricultural technicians in various localities to vigorously cultivate cotton planting experts to drive the masses to improve techniques, combine scientific methods with farmers' experience, and create a widespread cotton field production increase movement.

　　大力保苗加工加肥保证今年棉花增产
    华北各地棉花播种，经过月余艰苦工作，在与严重的旱灾、风灾作坚决斗争中克服了种种困难，据目前已收到的各地材料的概略估计，约可完成了华北种棉计划一千三百万亩的百分之八十。冀中八专区、冀南宁南等县均超过任务。其中优良棉种斯字棉的播种，经华北棉产改进处各指定县区的努力推广，完成二十三万八千余亩，比原计划超过三千余亩。从总的任务上讲，虽因秧种困难没有圆满完成计划，但人民在与各种灾害斗争中取得的成绩，确是十分难能可贵的。这些成绩将给发展华北纺织工业提供了初步保证，特别是斯字棉的推广，为明年扩大棉产开辟了一条广阔的道路。这是华北农民在国家经济建设中一大成绩。但这并不是说今年棉花播种已经结束，就可以坐待棉花丰收了。必须了解这还只能算做开始走了一步，还有更艰巨的工作要我们去做！这就是不容稍懈的要继续战胜虫灾及风旱等天然灾害，保证棉苗不死，并进一步组织群众加工加肥保证增产，争取使现有棉田产量增加二成，达到原计划产棉数量的要求。各地不能丝毫轻视或忽略这一工作，认为无关重要，或以为“群众自己会做”而放弃领导。应该认识到这是一件比组织播种更加艰苦复杂的、对增产更加有直接效果的工作。因为棉苗不同于其他谷物，死掉幼苗即不能再加补种。棉花的耕作技术好坏，与施肥量、肥料种类适当与否，对产量有着很密切的关系，同样的土地便能增加或减少三分之一至一倍的产量。为此，华北人民政府农业部及棉产改进处已提出各种办法（见本报本日农业生产专刊），各地必须以一切努力，组织这一工作的进行。在改进与推广植棉技术方面，冀中任邱等地在各村组织了典型座谈会，吸取了好的经验，加以介绍推广，这一方法值得各地学习。各地农业技术人员，应有计划有重点地加以指导，各级干部应迅速学习这些经验加强领导，结合各地农业技术人员，大力培养植棉能手去带动群众改进技术，使科学方法与农民经验结合起来，造成一个普遍的棉田增产运动。
