    North China People's Government Allocates Funds to Repair Lu Xun's Former Residence

    [Our Newspaper] In order to commemorate the revolutionary writer Lu Xun, the Cultural Relics Department of the North China Higher Education Commission has decided to repair his former residence. With the approval of the North China People's Government, a sum of 200,000 yuan has been allocated for the repair costs. The department has consulted with Lu Xun's widow, Ms. Xu Guangping, and the work will be undertaken by the Beijing Cultural Relics Arrangement Committee under the department. It may be used as a memorial hall after the repair. This house was where Lu Xun engaged in writing in his early years and was also the residence of Lu Xun's mother during her lifetime. It is located at No. 21, West Third Alley, Gongmenkou, Funei. There are still many books written by Lu Xun during his lifetime in the house. (Bai Sheng)
