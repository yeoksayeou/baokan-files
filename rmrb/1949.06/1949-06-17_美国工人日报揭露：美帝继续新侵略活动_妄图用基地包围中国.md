　　U.S. *Workers Daily* Exposes: U.S. Imperialism Continues New Acts of Aggression
　　Attempts to Encircle China with Bases
　　[Xinhua News Agency, Peiping, 16th] New York dispatch: The *Workers Daily* published an article on the 3rd of this month exposing the new acts of aggression by U.S. imperialism against China. The newspaper stated: The changes in the balance of power in Asia brought about by the great progress of the Chinese people have dealt a heavy blow to the imperialist partners and their vassals. Since they can no longer do anything on the Chinese mainland, they want to continue to carry out their sinister schemes by deploying naval and military bases around China. The United States is planning to rebuild Japan as the "factory of Asia." The recent brazen cancellation by the United States of Japan's reparations to countries such as Australia and the Philippines is part of this plan. On May 22nd, the *New York Herald Tribune* published an article by its Guangzhou correspondent, Elsor, openly proposing that the Chinese feudal warlords of Yunnan, Guangxi, and Sichuan should "defend their nests for as long as possible for the urgent interests of the United States." Elsor also advocated that the United States should occupy China's Taiwan. The *Workers Daily* said: For this purpose, the United States is delaying the conclusion of a peace treaty with Japan. The newspaper pointed out: This violent act of encircling China with bases can only arouse the anger of the Chinese people, and the result will inevitably be failure.

　　美国工人日报揭露：美帝继续新侵略活动
  　妄图用基地包围中国
    【新华社北平十六日电】纽约消息：工人日报本月三日载文揭露美帝国主义对中国的新侵略活动。该报称：中国人民的伟大进展所带来的亚洲力量对比的变化，给了帝国主义伙伴及其附庸们以沉重的打击。他们在中国大陆上既然已经不能够作什么事情，他们就又想用在中国周围布置陆海军基地的办法，继续施展其恶毒阴谋。美国正计划将日本重建为“亚洲工厂”，美国最近悍然取消日本对澳、菲等国的赔偿，即是这个计划的一部分。五月二十二日纽约先驱论坛报曾登载其驻广州记者艾尔索的文章，公然提出要云南、广西和四川的中国封建军阀们“为了美国迫切的利益，应尽可能长久地防卫他们的巢穴”。艾尔索且主张由美国霸占中国的台湾。工人日报说：为了这一目的，美国正在拖延对日和约的签订。该报指出：用基地包围中国这一狂暴的行为，只能引起中国人民的愤怒，其结果必然是要失败的。
