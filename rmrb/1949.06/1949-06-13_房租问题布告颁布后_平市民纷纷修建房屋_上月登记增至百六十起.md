　　After the Promulgation of the Rent Issue Proclamation

　　Residents of Beiping are Building Houses One After Another

　　Registrations Increased to 160 Cases Last Month

　　[This Newspaper's Dispatch] Residents of Beiping Municipality are enthusiastically going to the Municipal People's Government Construction Bureau to apply for building and repairing houses, now reaching more than twenty cases per day. According to statistics from the Construction Bureau, in April of this year, 79 applications were made for building houses, 39 for repairing houses, and 59 for miscellaneous (building wooden lofts, advertising boards, building awnings, installing machines, etc.). By May, the number of applications for building houses had increased to 106, for repairing houses to 65, and for miscellaneous construction to 287. This year, the number of people repairing houses in the city in the summer is actually more than in the spring, reversing the usual practice of previous years. Since the Beiping Military Control Commission announced the Rent Issue Proclamation, citizens feel that property rights are guaranteed, and the People's Government's policy of developing urban production will inevitably require a large number of houses. Therefore, they have come to apply for registration to build houses one after another. In order to facilitate citizens' registration, the Construction Bureau strives to handle registration procedures quickly. Unless there are special circumstances, all application, survey, review, and registration procedures are completed within five to seven days. (Lan)

　　房租问题布告颁布后
  　平市民纷纷修建房屋
    上月登记增至百六十起
    【本报讯】平市居民踊跃前往人民政府建设局申请建筑修理房屋，现日达二十余起。据建设局统计，本年四月份前往申请建筑房屋者七十九件，修理房屋者三十九件，杂项（造木阁子、广告牌、搭凉棚、按机器等事项）修筑者五十九件，至五月份建筑房屋者增至一百零六件，修理房屋者六十五件，杂项修筑者二百八十七件。今年本市夏季修筑房屋者反而较春季为多，一反往年之常例。自北平市军管会公布房租问题布告后，市民感到产权有保障，而且人民政府发展城市生产的政策，势必需要大量房屋。乃纷纷前往申请登记建筑房屋。建设局为便利市民登记，力求迅速办理登记手续，非有特殊事故者，一律在五天至七天之间办理完毕申请、查勘、审核、登记等手续。　　　　　　　　　（蓝）
