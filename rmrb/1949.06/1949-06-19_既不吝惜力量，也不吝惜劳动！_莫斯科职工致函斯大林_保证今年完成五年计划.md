　　Neither stint on strength nor labor!
    Moscow Workers Write to Stalin
　　Guaranteeing Completion of Five-Year Plan This Year
    [Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 18th] TASS, Moscow, 16th: Workers, foremen, technicians, engineers and clerks from various enterprises in Moscow, after discussions at meetings, passed a letter to Stalin. The letter said: Dear Comrade Stalin: We are pleased to inform you that the output of the most important industries in Moscow this April has already reached the average monthly output of 1950 (the last year of the post-war Five-Year Plan). The letter wrote: We deeply know that the post-war Five-Year Plan is a component part of the great program you laid down for building our socialist society. All of us are constantly concerned with completing the Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule and further developing industry, concerned with making the entire national economy prosper, and making the economic power of the Soviet motherland steadily develop. For this purpose, we neither stint on strength nor labor. Comrade Stalin, we assure you that we will complete the Five-Year Plan in industrial production in four years. We will reach the output of 1950 stipulated in the Five-Year Plan this year.
    Pravda on Completing the Five-Year Plan Ahead of Schedule is a New Victory of Socialism over the Historical Importance of the Capitalist World!
    Pravda specially published an editorial for this letter, writing: The achievements made by Muscovites in the movement to complete the Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule are a vivid manifestation of the strong power of the Soviet social system and state system, and a proof of the great organizational and mobilization work that the Bolshevik Party is now carrying out; the Bolshevik Party organizes the labor efforts of the Soviet people and directs them towards a common goal, Pravda continued, Muscovites have been models of fulfilling guarantees more than once. Now, because their movement to fully utilize equipment, workspace, and other internal potentials is expanding, and because 96% of Moscow's employees have participated in the labor competition, they will undoubtedly be able to complete this new guarantee in the same way: to complete the Five-Year Plan this year. The people of the entire Soviet Union will welcome the achievements of Muscovites in striving to complete the Five-Year Plan in four years with joyful and patriotic pride. This achievement will be the prelude to a new great victory of our Soviet motherland. The early completion of the post-war Five-Year Plan will show that: while capitalist countries are mired in a quagmire, caught in an abyss of unsolvable contradictions, and their economies are heading towards a new crisis that cannot be overcome, the Soviet state is victoriously advancing, and its economic power is constantly strengthening. This will be a new victory of growing and consolidating socialism over decaying and outdated capitalism with world historical importance!

　　既不吝惜力量，也不吝惜劳动！
    莫斯科职工致函斯大林
  　保证今年完成五年计划
    【新华社北平十八日电】塔斯社莫斯科十六日电：莫斯科各企业的工人、领班、技师、工程师、职员们经过开会讨论，通过一封写给斯大林的信。信里说：亲爱的斯大林同志：我们怀着愉快的心情告诉你，莫斯科大多数最重要的工业今年四月份的产量，已经达到一九五○年（战后五年计划的最后一年）每月平均的产量。信里写道：我们深知，战后五年计划是你为了建设我国社会主义社会而订下的伟大纲领的组成部分。我们全体都不断地关心提前完成五年计划和进一步发展工业，关心使整个国民经济繁荣，并使苏维埃祖国的经济威力稳步发展。为了这个目的，我们既不吝惜力量，也不吝惜劳动。斯大林同志，我们向你保证四年内在工业生产量上完成五年计划。我们将在今年达到五年计划所规定的一九五○年的产量。
    真理报论提前完成五年计划，是社会主义对资本主义世界历史重要性的新胜利！
    真理报特为这封信发表社论写道：莫斯科人在提前完成五年计划的运动中获得的成就，是苏维埃社会制度与国家制度强大力量的生动表现，是布尔什维克党现在正进行着的巨大的组织与动员工作的证明；布尔什维克党把苏联人民的劳动努力组织起来，并且指挥他们向着共同的目标前进，真理报继称，莫斯科人不止一次地是完成保证的模范。现在，由于他们的充分利用装备、工作间的空间、及其他内在潜力的运动正在扩大，由于莫斯科百分之九十六的职工都参加了劳动竞赛，他们无疑将能同样完成这个新的保证：在今年完成五年计划。全苏联人民将以愉快的及爱国自豪的心情，欢迎莫斯科人争取四年完成五年计划所得到的成就，这种成就将是我们苏维埃祖国新的伟大胜利的先声。战后五年计划的提前完成，将表现出：正当资本主义国家陷于泥沼不能自拔，陷入无法解决的矛盾深渊、和他们的经济正在无法克服地走向新危机的时候，苏维埃国度却正在胜利地前进，而且它的经济力量正在不断地加强。这将是正在成长与巩固中的社会主义对腐朽垂死的过时的资本主义之具有世界历史重要性的新胜利！
