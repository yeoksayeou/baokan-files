　　Xinhua News Agency, Hankou, 7th. The Wuhan Military Control Commission's Materials Takeover Department has begun taking over factories of Kuomintang bureaucratic capitalists and is actively planning for resumption of work. The units taken over include Central China Iron and Steel Company, E'nan Electric Power Company, Huaxin Cement Company, Hubei Provincial Machinery Factory, Wuhan Glass Factory, Hubei Provincial Hankou Textile Factory, Hubei Provincial Hankou Chemical Factory, Hubei Provincial Hanyang Oil Refinery, Grain Ministry Hankou Rice Mill, China Petroleum Company, China Vegetable Oil Factory, Resources Committee Coal Mining Bureau, China Salt Industry Corporation, and more than thirty other units. Thanks to the efforts of the factory workers to protect them, most of the equipment and materials in the factories are intact. The workers have also prepared inventories to assist the military control commission personnel in taking over. Currently, the difficulties in resuming work in the factories are the lack of raw materials and funds. The military control commission is currently studying the matter carefully and preparing to invest and resume work in a step-by-step manner.
    Xinhua News Agency, Hankou, 7th. After the liberation of the Daye mining area, the heavy industrial center of Central China, order is good. The takeover work in the mining area has begun and is actively proceeding to restore production. The workers of the large-scale Central China Iron and Steel Plant are repairing production equipment to meet new production tasks. In addition to continuing operation, a new plant with a power generation capacity of 10,000 kilowatts is under construction at the Daye Power Plant. Huaxin Cement Factory, which produces 1,000 tons of cement per day, has suspended production due to the lack of sales in the past. Now, with the support of the trade company, it is preparing to resume work. Yuanhua, Lihua, and other coal mines are also producing coal as usual. When the Kuomintang bandit troops retreated southward from Jiangbei, they looted more than 20 vehicles from the mining area and damaged some parts of the ship machinery, but the equipment of the factories was not looted or destroyed due to the stricter precautions taken by the workers and staff.

　　武汉华中钢铁公司等三十余单位被我接收
  　大冶矿区积极恢复生产
    【新华社汉口七日电】武汉军事管制委员会物资接管部已开始接管国民党官僚资本的工厂，并积极地筹划复工。被接管的单位有华中钢铁公司、鄂南电力公司、华新水泥公司、湖北省机械厂、武汉玻璃厂、湖北省汉口纺织厂、湖北省汉口化学厂、湖北省汉阳炼油厂、粮食部汉口碾米厂、中国石油公司、中国植物油料厂、资委会煤业总局、中国盐业公司等三十余单位。由于各工厂职工努力保护，各厂器材物资大部完好。职工们并造好清册，协助军管会人员接管。目前各工厂复工的困难是缺乏原料与资金，现军管会正周密研究，准备有步骤地进行投资与复工。
    【新华社汉口七日电】华中重工业中心地大冶矿区解放后，秩序良好，现矿区接管工作已开始，并正积极进行恢复生产。规模宏大的华中钢铁厂职工正在修整生产设备，以迎接新的生产任务。大冶电厂除继续开工外，发电一万基罗瓦特的新厂正兴建中。每天产水泥一千吨的华新水泥厂，因过去出品无销路，生产停滞，现在贸易公司支持下，正筹备复工。源华、利华等煤矿亦照常出煤。国民党匪军自江北往南溃退时，曾抢去矿区汽车二十余辆，并破坏轮船机件一部，但各工厂设备则因工人职员防范较严，未遭抢劫破坏。
