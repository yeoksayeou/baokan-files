    [Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, 19th] The Northwest General Branch of the China Democratic League recently convened its first cadre meeting, deciding to move the Northwest General Branch of the League from Yan'an back to Xi'an. It also made a resolution calling on the people of the Northwest to support the policies of the Chinese Communist Party and carry the revolution through to the end; in the liberated areas, to reorganize the League's organization; and in the areas under Kuomintang rule, to broadly unite democratic figures from all sides to strive for the liberation of the Great Northwest.
