Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, 24th: In the five months since the liberation of Tianjin, the Tianjin China Textile Construction Company has rapidly restored and even begun to increase production. Before the liberation of Tianjin, each factory only operated three days a week due to a lack of raw materials. Now, with the exception of the Seventh Factory, which suffered heavier losses in the Tianjin liberation battles, all factories have resumed operating six days a week. The output of each factory in May also increased compared to the normal output before liberation. Cloth production increased by an average of 8% per day, and yarn increased by 5%. In terms of quality, the strength standard of 20-count yarn increased by 32%. In terms of conservation, the Fourth Factory's electric boiler room burned 64.5 tons of coal per month before liberation, but now only needs slightly more than 30 tons per month, saving more than half. Many employees of the Second Factory have organized production mutual aid groups to help each other improve production technology. Technical personnel and worker representatives from the Fifth Factory established a weekly production review meeting, ensuring that the factory's production plan is completed on schedule.

The main reasons for the rapid recovery and increase in the company's production are, first and foremost, that the Tianjin Military Control Commission conscientiously implemented the Chinese Communist Party's urban policies and implemented complete takeover by system. In the early days of Tianjin's liberation, some staff members, not understanding the CCP's urban policies, were afraid of being "laid off" and worked uneasily, adopting a passive attitude. At this time, the leadership, on the one hand, provided explanations, and on the other hand, temporarily retained all original staff, except for resolute counter-revolutionaries mixed in with the staff, at their original positions and salaries, without disrupting the original technical organization and production system, and promoted various tasks through the original technical organization and production system. In this way, the production morale of the staff was gradually stabilized, and the company and the factories' production quickly got on the right track. However, in the early stages of the takeover, some necessary and possible reforms were neglected. For example, in production management, the bureaucratic system left over from the Kuomintang, the serious bureaucratic work style of some staff members, and the special inequalities in treatment of workers not based on production technology were not resolved in a timely manner, which once caused worker dissatisfaction. The military representatives of each factory did not have a clear understanding of their own powers, resulting in universal manifestations of paternalism and事務ism, weakening the enthusiasm of factory directors, engineers, and others. In organizing and leading production, and in reforming and uniting old staff members, some military representatives and work team cadres showed empiricism and sectarianism, failing to humbly learn modern, scientific factory management and production technology, and mechanically transplanting rural handicraft-style factory management methods and experience. As a result, they failed to enable old staff members to boldly exert their abilities and skills in their work.

Second, after the liberation of Tianjin, each factory used various methods such as giving large lectures, publishing blackboard newspapers, and holding study classes to conduct political education for workers, and quickly disbanded the pseudo-trade unions that oppressed workers, and organized temporary workers' representative conferences that truly represented the interests of the workers. In early March, the military representatives, factory administrative personnel, and worker representatives jointly conducted an inventory. The People's Government also provided care and relief to workers in many aspects of their material lives, thereby gradually establishing a sense of ownership among the workers, and their production morale increased accordingly. However, some workers mistakenly believed that they could stop working after liberation, resulting in lax work, failure to abide by factory rules, and waste of raw materials, which affected production. In terms of worker unity, in the past, the Kuomintang used staff members to rule workers, coupled with the special and excessive disparity in treatment between staff members and workers that was unrelated to production, creating serious contradictions between staff members and workers. Some staff members still had serious bureaucratic work styles and a purely technical viewpoint after liberation, being arrogant and looking down on workers. After the liberation of Tianjin, many workers demanded to struggle against certain staff members and demanded equal salaries with staff members and technicians. In response, the leadership, on the one hand, educated staff members to change their thinking of despising workers and their bureaucratic work styles; on the other hand, it educated workers that all demands and actions should conform to the spirit of restoring and developing production, and that absolutely equal wages were unreasonable, and only certain necessary and reasonable adjustments could be made individually. After Comrade Liu Shaoqi's report on strengthening worker unity, the leadership and the majority of workers clearly recognized that staff members were part of the working class and the importance of strengthening worker unity, and the relationship between staff members and workers was greatly improved. Under the leadership of the temporary workers' representative conference, the workers of the Fifth Factory have begun to help each other in their work, correct shortcomings, and jointly discuss and improve technology, and the connection between factories has also been strengthened.

Third, after production at each factory began to get on the right track, starting in April, the company leadership established, for the first time in the history of the China Textile Company, a production planning system and a reporting and summarizing system, stipulated production standards, and coordinated with cost inspections to measure factory management and technology, thereby improving the production efficiency of each factory.

Fourth, preliminary solutions were found to problems such as worker welfare, health care, and cultural entertainment. In terms of welfare, in addition to retaining the original facilities from before liberation, twelve employee welfare cooperatives were organized, with a total of more than 42,000 members. Some factories have begun to provide vaccinations for employees. The China Textile Company is planning to build a larger hospital. Each factory has opened technical training classes, literacy classes, and rotational training classes, and is planning to open middle schools. Employees of each factory have organized troupes, singing teams, and yangko teams.

Note: The company originally had seven textile factories, one silk weaving factory, and one machinery factory (under which there were four workshops), with more than 25,000 employees, 338,280 spindles, and 8,667 looms. Currently, the affiliated First, Second, Third, Fourth, Fifth, and Sixth Textile Factories, as well as the Silk Weaving Factory and the Machinery Factory, have all started operation, with a total of 23,000 employees, 290,056 spindles, and 7,142 looms. The Seventh Textile Factory was destroyed by artillery fire in the Tianjin liberation battles and is now being rebuilt on its original foundation into a bleaching and dyeing factory that can produce 1,000 pieces each of bleached cloth and military cloth per day, which is expected to be completed in 30 weeks.

    加强职工团结建立各种制度
    天津中纺生产迅速提高
    【新华社天津二十四日电】天津中国纺织建设公司在天津解放后五个月来，生产已迅速恢复并开始有所提高。在天津解放前夕，各厂由于原料缺乏，每周只开工三天，现在除在天津解放战斗中受损失较重的第七厂以外，均已恢复为每周开工六天。各厂产量五月份较解放前的正常产量亦有增加。布平均每日增加了百分之八，纱增加了百分之五。在质量上，二十支纱的强力标准增加了百分之三十二。在节约方面，如四厂电机锅炉房解放前每月烧煤六十四吨半，现在每月只需三十吨多，节省了一半以上。二厂许多职工组织了生产互助组织，互相帮助改进生产技术。五厂技术人员和职工代表建立了每周生产检讨会，保证了该厂生产计划按期完成。
    该公司生产能迅速恢复和提高的主要原因，首先是天津军管会认真执行了中国共产党的城市政策，实行了按系统的完整的接管。天津解放初期，有些职员由于不了解中共的城市政策，恐怕“被裁”，工作不安，抱着消极态度。这时，领导方面一方面进行解释，一方面对于原有职员，除了那些混在职员中的坚决的反革命分子以外，一律暂行原职原薪，没有打乱原来的技术组织和生产系统，并通过原有技术组织和生产系统来推行各项工作。这样，就逐渐稳定了职员的生产情绪，并使公司与各厂的生产迅速走上正轨。但是，在接管初期，忽略了某些必要与可能的改革。如在生产管理上，对国民党遗留下来的官僚主义制度及某些职员的严重的官僚主义作风，和职工在待遇上不是按照生产技术规定的特殊的不平等现象，没有及时地解决，致一度引起工人不满。各厂军事代表对自己的职权认识不够明确，以致普遍表现包办代替和事务主义作风，减弱了厂长、工程师等人的积极性。在组织和领导生产上，改造和团结旧职员上，有些军事代表和工作组的干部，表现了经验主义和宗派主义毛病，不能虚心地学习现代化的、科学的工厂管理和生产技术，而机械地搬运农村的手工业式的工厂管理的方法和经验。因而未能使旧职员在工作中大胆地发挥其能力与技术。
    第二，天津解放后，各厂用上大课，出黑板报，开学习班等多种方式对工人进行政治教育，并迅速地解散了压迫工人的伪工会，组织了真正代表工人利益的临时职工代表会。三月初，由军事代表、厂方行政人员、工人代表三方面会同进行了清点工作。人民政府又在物质生活上对工人多方面予以照顾、救济，因而使工人们逐渐建立了主人翁的思想，生产情绪随之提高。但也有些工人误认为解放后就可以不干活了，因而工作松懈，不守厂规，浪费原料，影响生产。在职工团结方面，过去由于国民党利用职员统治工人，加上职员和工人待遇上非生产性的特殊的过分的悬殊，造成了职工间的严重矛盾。也有一些职员在解放后依然存在严重的官僚主义作风和单纯的技术观点，自高自大，瞧不起工人。天津解放后，曾有许多工人要求斗争某些职员，要求与职员、技师同等薪资。对此，领导方面曾一面教育职员改变轻视工人的思想和官僚主义作风；一面又教育工人，一切要求与行动，应合乎恢复和发展生产的精神，工薪绝对平均是不合理的，只能个别地作某些必要的和合理的调整。在刘少奇同志加强职工团结的报告后，领导方面和多数职工都明确地认识了职员是工人阶级的一部分与加强职工团结的重要性，职工关系大为改善。五厂职工在临时职工代表会领导下，已开始在工作中互相帮助，改正缺点，共同研讨改进技术，厂与厂之间的联系亦有加强。
    第三，在各厂生产开始步入正轨后，公司领导方面由四月份开始，首次建立了中纺公司历史上从来未有过的生产计划制度和汇报总结制度，规定了生产标准，并配合以成本检查，用这些来衡量工厂的管理和技术，提高了各厂的生产效率。
    第四，初步解决了职工福利、卫生保健及文化娱乐等问题。在福利方面，除保留了解放前原有的设施以外，并组织了职工福利合作社十二处，社员共达四万二千余人。部分工厂已开始为职工进行防疫注射。中纺公司正筹建一所规模较大之医院。各厂已开办了技术训练班、识字班和轮训班，并正在筹划开办中学。各厂职工都组织了剧团、歌咏队、秧歌队等。
    按：该公司原有七个纺织厂，一个丝织厂，一个机械厂（下属四个工场），职工两万五千余名，纱锭三十三万八千二百八十枚，布机八千六百六十七台。现所属第一、二、三、四、五、六纺织厂及丝织厂，机械厂都已开工，共有职工两万三千人，纱锭二十九万零五十六枚，布机七千一百四十二台。第七纺织厂因在天津解放战斗中被炮火所毁，现正以原有基础，修建一个可以日产漂白布、军用布各千匹的漂染厂，预计三十个星期可完成。
