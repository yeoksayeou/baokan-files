	Chapter Three: Farmer Guerrilla (Continued 1)
	Four
	A few days later, the guerrillas were practicing again when someone reported, "Several puppet soldiers have come to West Fishing Village, all carrying guns, and they are beating people at the village office. You all go quickly!" Da Shui excitedly said, "They're here again, let's greet them!" Everyone said, "Let's go! Beat those bastards!" Da Shui said, "Hold on, hold on! We have to talk about it first this time." The old platoon leader stood up and said, "Today is daytime, so we need to be quick. Surround them quickly, and go straight for the top. If we go for the top, there won't be any danger." Everyone shouted, "That's right! Let's go for the top first." Gao Tuer happily said, "It's good to fight in the daytime, we won't hit our own people." Da Shui said, "That's right, let's go!" A group of people set off immediately.
	When they were two li away from West Fishing Village, they started running. After running for a while, they were all panting heavily. When they reached the entrance of the village, the old platoon leader fell behind. He waved his hand and shouted, "Send a few people quickly. Post guards at the entrance of the village!" But no one paid attention, they were all busy running to "go for the top."
	Everyone ran to the village office and rushed onto the roof. The old platoon leader also arrived and climbed onto the roof. Da Shui quietly asked him, "Why don't I see anyone? Did we miss them again?" The old platoon leader gave the order, "Throw bricks!" From three sides of the roof, the decorative walls were torn down, and bricks were thrown down with a crash, but there was still no movement inside the house or in the courtyard.
	Gao Tuer anxiously said, "What's going on? I'll go down and take a look." He got off the roof, holding a large gun, and walked to the door of the north room. He pushed the door open, and there was a gunshot from inside. Gao Tuer quickly dodged and went into the nearby mill shed. Several puppet soldiers fired at the roof while rushing out. Niu Da Shui crouched by the decorative wall, hiding his head, and shouted, "They're coming out, shoot, shoot!" But the more anxious he was, the more his Mauser pistol seemed to have a problem, and it wouldn't fire. Everyone lowered their heads and fired randomly, and the puppet soldiers rushed out. The old platoon leader shouted, "Chase!" Everyone got off the roof and chased after them in a chaotic manner.
	They chased to the outside of the village and saw the puppet soldiers running ahead, they were all very anxious and busy shooting, but the people behind shot the people in front. Someone shouted, "Oh no, Cui @# has been hit!" Da Shui turned around to look, and it turned out that Gao Tuer had shot Cui @#'s arm. Everyone was busy taking care of the wounded, and the puppet soldiers ran away.

	Back in the village, the old platoon leader went to find Shuangxi, grumbling angrily, "I'm not doing this anymore! Is this playing around, or fighting a war? It's a complete mess. I've been a platoon leader for more than ten years, and I've never seen soldiers like this! ... I ... Alas! I can't do it anymore!" Shuangxi asked what had happened and comforted him, "Don't worry, old man, what kind of soldiers are these? They are all hands that hold hoe handles. How can they fight a war just by picking up a gun? This is like 'a cripple carrying water' - it has to be done step by step! We'll have a review meeting tomorrow, and you can give us some pointers!" The old platoon leader smiled at this last sentence and replied repeatedly, "No problem, no problem." Shuangxi went to find Da Shui.
	Niu Da Shui was very annoyed after returning, and was crawling on the table alone, panting and angry. He thought over and over in his heart, "Damn it, this won't work! Leading so many people to fight, if it's not done right, we'll end up hitting our own people. What should I do?" Just when he felt extremely unlucky, an old woman came to the yard, she was Cui @#'s mother, shouting, "Where's Niu Da Shui? Why did he hit my boy for no reason! What kind of captain is he?" Da Shui heard this and quickly went into the inner room, locked the door, and dared not see her. The old woman scolded and walked in angrily. Others said, "Da Shui is not here." and tried to persuade her. Shuangxi came, and the old woman grabbed him and said, "Village chief, what do you say? If my boy is crippled, who will I rely on?" Shuangxi said a lot of good things, but the old woman still refused to listen.
	At this time, Cui @#'s arm had already been bandaged, and he also came to find Shuangxi, crying and saying, "Village chief, what do you say? Damn it! I have no grievances with Gao Tuer, why did he shoot me? Niu Da Shui doesn't care, am I just shot for nothing? If I become a cripple, who will support my family? No, I have to sue him!" The old monk Ai couldn't help but say, "Come on! Gao Tuer didn't hit you on purpose, he was crying anxiously just now. You didn't hurt your bones, how can you become a cripple!" Cui @# rolled his eyes and said, "Heh, didn't hurt my bones, you say it so easily, I'll shoot you once and see!" The old woman and Ai the monk also started arguing.
	Shuangxi quickly stopped them and promised to give Cui @# one hundred and fifty catties of millet to recover from his injury. Cui @# thought it was too little, and after arguing, he finally got two hundred and fifty catties, and the mother and son took the rice strip and left.
	As soon as they left, Ma Danxiao came to hand over his gun. Because Cui @# was injured, he was afraid, and after listening to his wife, he felt that his family had a few acres of land, enough to eat and drink, why bother with this life-threatening thing? So he suggested that he would never do it again. Whenever he mentioned fighting, his face turned pale. Shuangxi laughed at him, "When were you scared to death?" Ma Danxiao said, "N...n...not cowardly, but I can't help myself!" After talking for a while, Shuangxi understood his thoughts and told him that fighting the Japanese was to protect our land. After persuading him for a long time, Ma Danxiao hung his head and took the gun away.
	Here, Shuangxi asked, "Where's our captain?" Someone pointed to the inner room with their mouths. Shuangxi peeked into the room through the crack in the door, and then used a thin stick to open the door, and suddenly rushed in, saying, "Good! You're so relaxed, you don't care about the people you injured!" Da Shui sat on the edge of the kang, without raising his head, and said nothing. Shuangxi said, "What's wrong with you!" Da Shui said angrily, "I'm not doing it anymore!" Shuangxi heard this and found it funny, and said, "Okay, okay, I'm not doing it either, let's go home!" While saying this, he pulled Da Shui to leave. Da Shui struggled and said, "Shuangxi, I feel very uncomfortable, and you're still joking!" Shuangxi said, "I'm not joking, I have something to tell you. Let's go, let's go! Let's go to my place for dinner." And pulled Da Shui away.
	After the two finished dinner, they lit the lamp. Shuangxi asked Da Shui, "You said you're not doing it anymore, why aren't you doing it?" Da Shui said, "I can't lead soldiers, I can't fight, how can I do it?" Shuangxi laughed and said, "Who was born a great general from their mother's womb? Who doesn't learn slowly!" Da Shui said, "I can't learn it, I... I have to change careers anyway!" Shuangxi said, "Changing careers is useless! When the Japanese come, we all have to learn to fight, if we don't learn, we won't survive."
	Da Shui said with a bitter face, "Other things are easy to learn, but this thing can easily hurt people?" Shuangxi saw that he was too discouraged, so he sat next to him and comforted him, "Can fighting not hurt people? ... Let's have a meeting tomorrow to review and see where the problem is, and if we think about it more, we'll find a way." He secretly told him, "Old Hei Cai said: Our Communist Party members must not be afraid of hitting snags, the more we hit, the harder we become, and if we become an iron head, we won't be afraid of anything."
	That night, Da Shui slept at Shuangxi's place, but he couldn't sleep. He felt very embarrassed, and also felt that Shuangxi's words were correct.

	Six
	The next day, a cadre meeting was convened at the squadron headquarters, and the squad leaders all arrived, and Old Hei Cai also came to attend the meeting. At the meeting, Old Hei Cai said with a smile, "Our part of the guerrilla team has fought two small battles. Although there was no victory, we managed to scare the enemy away." Everyone laughed. Old Hei Cai said, "Seriously, they are all farmers, but it's not easy! There are shortcomings, but that's okay, overcoming shortcomings is an advantage. As the old saying goes: 'People are tempered in the world, and knives are sharpened on stone'. You all should review and review well today!"
	The old platoon leader eagerly spoke, "I say, our team is too chaotic! Once a battle starts, it's like bees in a disorganized camp, how can this work? According to our old rules, whoever the officer speaks to must obey; if you're told to go east, you go east, if you're told to go west, you go west, no one can make a wrong step. Military orders are as heavy as a mountain! If you don't listen to orders, how can you fight?"
	Everyone reviewed many shortcomings. Niu Da Shui said embarrassedly, "I also have a shortcoming! Yesterday, I fought for a while, but I didn't know what was wrong with the gun, it just wouldn't fire. When I came back to check, the big firing pin was open, but the small firing pin was closed!" Everyone laughed until their stomachs hurt. But everyone said, "Don't laugh!" "Don't laugh!" "Don't laugh!" Gao Tuer said, "What are you laughing at! I'm the most capable, always hitting our own people! I have to change it in the future, don't aim don't shoot, if I shoot I have to hit the enemy!"
	The old platoon leader became excited and stood up and said, "I say, I say!" Everyone said, "You say it!" The old platoon leader said, "I say, when we fight again, we have to have a plan; we also have to scout well, and we also have to have good contact; and also, we have to have a crisp discipline!" Shuangxi said, "That's right! Shall we make a few rules?" Everyone said, "Okay!" So they made many rules, don't do this, don't do that, whoever violates it will be punished. Now, Da Shui was happy and said, "If that's the case, then I also have something to grab onto as a captain! This matter is too important, we have to have a meeting with all the members to talk about it, and all these things must be remembered. We can't do it this time, but we'll see next time."
	Old Hei Cai saw that everyone was in high spirits, and he was very happy. He said, "That's good. As long as you have confidence and courage, you will naturally gain experience as you fight more battles." He looked at Da Shui with a smile in his eyes and said, "In the future, be calm in case of trouble. If the person steering the boat doesn't panic, the people on the boat can be stable. The squadron leader controls the squad leaders, and the squad leaders control the members, and if we control it level by level, there will be no problem!"
	After the meeting, Da Shui went to the district with Old Hei Cai to attend the squadron leader joint meeting; he also wanted to see Yang Xiaomei by the way.

	Seven
	Da Shui was in the district, and after the meeting, he went to see Yang Xiaomei by the way. Just as he reached the entrance of the alley, he saw a woman from West Fishing Village, asking someone where Xiaomei lived. Da Shui recognized her as the famous "Big Gold Tooth". She had oily hair, a face full of powder, a red jacket and green pants, weird and strange. Da Shui asked her, "What are you looking for Yang Xiaomei for?" She said angrily, "Beat her for what? Hmph! I'm going to sue her!"

(To be continued) (with picture)
"Big Gold Tooth" wanted to find Xiaomei to sue her, and Niu Da Shui wouldn't let her in.

　　第三回　农民游击队（续一）
    四
    过了几天，游击队刚好又在操练，有人来报告说：“西渔村来了几个伪军，都带的枪，在村公所打人呢。你们快去吧！”大水兴奋的说：“又来了，招呼吧！”大伙儿说：“走！打他兔崽子！”大水说：“慢着慢着！这回可得先说说。”老排长就站出来说：“今儿个是白天，动作要迅速，包围的快，去了就压顶，压了顶就没有危险了。”大伙儿嚷着说：“着哇！先去压顶。”高屯儿高兴的说：“白天打仗好，打不着自己人。”大水说：“对，快走吧！”一伙人马上出发了。
    他们离西渔村二里地，就跑开了，跑了一阵，都张着大嘴儿，呼呼呼的喘气呢。跑到村口，老排长落在后面，他挥着手喊：“快去几个人。村口都站上岗！”可是谁也没注意，都忙着跑去“压顶”了。
    大伙儿跑到村公所，纷纷的上房。老排长也赶来了，爬上房顶。大水悄悄问他：“怎么不见人，不是又扑空了？”老排长就下命令说：“扔砖！”三面房顶上，就拆下花墙，把砖儿劈哩啪啦的扔下去，可是屋里院里还是没一点动静。
    高屯儿着急说：“这怎么回事？我下去瞧瞧。”他下了房，端着个大枪，走到北屋门口；一推门，里面叭的打了一枪，高屯儿忙一闪，钻进旁边的磨棚里去了。几个伪军一面朝房上打枪，一面往外冲。牛大水扒在花墙边，藏着脑袋瓜，大喊：“出来啦，快打快打！”可是越着急，手里的盒子枪不知出了什么毛病，越打不响。大伙儿都低着头乱放枪，伪军可冲出去了。老排长忙喊了一声：“追！”大伙儿都下了房，乱哄哄的追去。
    他们追到村外，看见伪军就在前面跑呢，心里都挺着急，忙着开枪打，谁想后面的人把前面的人打着了。有人喊：“坏了坏了，崔＠碌挂彩了！”大水忙转身回来看，原来是高屯儿把崔＠碌的胳膊打着了。大伙儿只顾招护伤号，伪军就跑掉了。
　　五
    回到村里，老排长就找双喜，很生气的嘟嚷说：“我不干了！这是闹着玩儿，还是打仗呀？简直是乱七八糟。我当了十几年的排长，没见过这样的兵！……我……唉！我干不了啦！”双喜问明了情由，就安慰他说：“你老人家别着急，咱们这些兵是什么兵呀，都是拿锄把子的手，猛不乍的拿起枪就会打仗啊？这可是‘瘸子担水’——得一步步来么！赶明儿咱们开个检讨会，你老人家多点拨点拨吧！”老排长听了这最后一句话，笑开了脸儿，一连应着：“没说的，没说的。”双喜就找大水去了。
    牛大水回来以后，很奥恼，独个儿爬在桌子上，呼吃呼吃生气呢。他心里来回的想：“他妈的，这个事儿不行啊！带这么些人打仗，弄不好，尽打自己人，可怎么着？”正觉得倒霉不过，外面又来了个老婆儿，是崔＠碌的娘，在院里喊叫：“牛大水在哪儿？怎么好好的把我小子打了！他这个队长是干什么的呀？”大水一听不好，连忙钻到里间屋，把门插上，不敢见她。老婆儿一面数落着，一面气冲冲的走进来。旁人说：“大水不在。”还劝她。双喜来了，老婆儿拉住他说：“村长，你说怎么着？我小子要残废了，我靠谁去？”双喜说了许多好话，老婆儿还是不依。
    这时候，崔＠碌的胳膊已经包扎好了，也来打双喜，哭丧着脸儿说：“村长，你看怎么着？他妈×的！我跟高屯儿无怨无仇，他凭什么打我这一枪？牛大水也不管，就这么白打了我呀？我要成了废人，谁养我这一家？不行，我得打官司！”旁边艾和尚耐不住说：“得了吧！高屯儿又不是故意打你的，刚才他还急得直哭哩。你又没伤着骨头，怎么会成废人呢！”崔＠碌翻了一下眼睛说：“吓，没伤着骨头，你倒说得轻巧，我也打你一枪试试看！”老婆儿和艾和尚也吵起来了。”
    双喜忙把他们劝住，答应批一百五十斤小米，给崔＠碌养伤。崔＠碌嫌少，争来争去，最后给他批了二百五十斤，他娘儿俩才拿上米条走了。
    刚走，马胆小又来交枪，他因为崔＠碌挂彩，心里害怕，又听了他媳妇的话，觉得家里有几亩地，够吃够喝，干吗还闹这送命的事儿呀？就提出来，坚决不干了。一提起打仗，他就脸色发白。双喜笑他：“你哪一辈子是吓死的呀？”马胆小说：“不……不……不胆小，可就是不由得我自己呀！”谈了一阵，双喜明白了他的思想活动，就跟他说，打日本就是为了保卫咱们的土地嘛。开导他半天，马胆小才挂搭着脑袋，提着枪去了。
    这儿，双喜问：“咱们的队长呢？旁人朝里间房＠＠嘴。双喜扒着门缝儿往里瞧了一下，就用根细木棍儿把门拨开，猛的闯进去说：“好哇！你倒松心，打伤了人你不管啊！”大水坐在炕沿上，头也不抬，话也不说。双喜说：“你怎么啦！”大水气嚷嚷的说：“我不干了！”双喜听了，心里好笑，说：“好好好，我也不干了，咱们回家吧！”一边说，一边拉着大水就走。大水挣扎着说：“双喜，人家心里怪难受的，你还开玩笑！”双喜说：“不是开玩笑，我有话跟你说。走走走！到我那儿吃饭去。”就把大水拉走了。
    两个人吃罢晚饭，就上灯了。双喜问大水：“你说你不干了，你为什么不干呢？”大水说：“我带不了兵，打不了仗，怎么干呀？”双喜笑起来说：“谁从娘肚子里生下来就是个大将军呀？谁还不是慢慢儿学的！”大水说：“我学不会，我……我反正得跳行！”双喜说：“跳行有个鸡巴用！日本子来，咱们谁都得学会打仗，不学就吃不开。”
    大水苦着脸说：“旁的事儿好学，这个事儿弄不好就要伤人嘛？”双喜看他太丧气，就坐在他旁边安慰他：“打仗还能不伤人？……咱们明天开个会检讨检讨，看毛病出在那儿，多琢磨琢磨就有办法啦。”又悄悄跟他说：“黑老蔡说呢：咱们共产党员得不怕碰钉子，越碰越硬梆，碰成个铁头就什么都不怕啦。”
    这晚上，大水就在双喜那儿睡，他可睡不着，心里觉得怪为难，又觉得双喜的话也说得不错。
    六
    第二天在中队部，召集了个干部会，分队长们都到了，黑老蔡也来参加了这个会。会上，黑老蔡笑迷迷的说：“咱们这一部分游击队，打了两回小仗，虽说没什么胜利，总算把敌人吓跑啦。”大家都笑了。黑老蔡说：“正经话，都是庄稼人么，可也不容易啦！缺点是有，那不要紧，克服了缺点，就是优点。古话说的好：‘人在世上炼，刀在石上磨’。你们今天就好好儿检讨检讨吧！”
    老排长急着发言：“我说，咱们这队伍太乱！一打起仗来，就跟蜂子乱了营似的，这还行啊？照我们的老规矩，官长说句话，谁也得服从；叫你朝东你朝东，叫你朝西你朝西，谁也不能错一步。军令重如山啊！不听指挥，还能打仗？”
    大家都检讨出许多缺点。牛大水不好意思的说：“我也有个缺点！昨天我打了一阵子仗，不知枪坏在哪儿，就打不响，回来一瞧，大机头张着，小机头可关着呢！”大家听了，笑得肚子痛。可是谁都说：“别笑！”“别笑！”“别笑呀！”高屯儿说：“笑什么！就数我的本事大，尽打自己人！往后我得改一改，不瞄准不打枪，打就得打到敌人身上去！”
    老排长兴奋起来了，站起说：“我说，我说！”大家说：“你说吧！”老排长说：“我说呀，再打起仗来，咱们得有计划；还得侦察好，还得连络好；还得，还得有个嘎嘣儿脆的纪律！”双喜说：“着！咱们订上几条纪律好不好？”大伙儿说：“好！”就订了好些条纪律，不准这么，不准那么，谁要犯了，就得受处罚。这下子，大水可乐了，说：“要这么着，我这队长也有个抓挠啦！这事儿太重要，咱们得跟全体队员开个会，好好儿说说，这些一条一条的都得记住了。咱们这回不行，下回瞧。”
    黑老蔡瞧大家劲头儿挺足，心里很高兴，说：“这么着行喽。只要有信心，有勇气，仗打得多了，自然就有经验啦。”他眼睛里露着笑意，对大水闪了一眼，说：“以后有事儿要沉着，把舵的不慌，乘船的才能稳当。中队长掌握分队长，分队长掌握队员，一级级掌握好，就没问题啦！”
    会后，大水就跟黑老蔡到区上，开中队长联席会去；还想顺便去看看杨小梅。
    　　　　七
    大水在区上，开罢会，顺便去看杨小梅。刚走到胡同口，就瞧见西渔村的一个妇女，在跟人打听小梅住在哪儿，大水认出来是有名的“大金牙”。她头上油，脸上粉，红袄绿裤子，妖妖怪怪的。大水问她：“你找杨小梅干吗？”她怒气冲冲的说：“打她干吗？哼！我要跟她打官司！”　　　（未完）（附图片）
    “大金牙”要找小梅打官司，牛大水不让他进去。
