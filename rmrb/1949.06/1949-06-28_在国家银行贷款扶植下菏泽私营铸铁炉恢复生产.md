(Ji Lu Yu Electric) Heze's private Benlai Signal Cast Iron Furnace has resumed production with the support of loans from the State Bank. This company was established in 1935 and is the largest iron furnace in Heze. During the Kuomintang rule, it was forced to close down for two years due to a lack of raw materials and the inability to sell finished products. Currently, the vast number of farmers in our region are fully engaged in production, and farmers urgently need agricultural tools. The Heze Chengguan Working Group actively mobilized and supported its resumption of production, and the government provided a loan of 50,000 RMB to support it. The company began to resume work in early February. By the end of March, it had opened the furnace four times, casting more than 3,000 plowshares and more than 4,500 plow surfaces, which sold well in the surrounding villages. It is estimated that the company can obtain a net profit of more than 40,000 RMB and more than 2,000 jin of scrap iron from the production and sales of this batch of agricultural tools.

　　在国家银行贷款扶植下菏泽私营铸铁炉恢复生产
    【冀鲁豫电】菏泽私营本来信号铸铁炉，在国家银行贷款扶持下，已恢复生产。该号系于一九三五年建立，是菏泽最大的一家铁炉。国民党统治时期因原料缺乏，成品无法销售，曾被迫停业二年。目前我区广大农民全力进入生产，农民迫切需要农具，菏泽城关工作组积极动员和扶持其恢复生产，政府又贷给人民币五万元，予以支持。该号即于二月初开始复工，至三月底，共开涝四次铸制犁铧三千多个，及犁面等共四千五百余个畅销四乡。估计该号在这批农具的产制和销售中，可获净利四万余元，及破铁二千余斤。
