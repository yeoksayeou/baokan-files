　　军委电信总局第一电机修配厂成立
    【本报讯】中国人民革命军事委员会电信总局第一电机修配厂于六月一日正式成立。该厂原为国民党联勤总部第五补给区电信机械修理厂。二月七日由军管会接管后，并将北平广播电台修理厂、张家口第五电机修理所、傅作义部的一个电机修理所与该厂合并。经过详细调查研究，于三月十日将人事问题处理完毕，即开始确定机构与人员配备，修理厂房，增加机器。同时，一九三八年在延安成立的一个电机修理厂也于五月中旬迁平，与该厂合并。至五月三十一日准备工作告一段落，遂确定六月一日正式成立第一电机修配厂。在该厂成立大会上，电信总局刘寅局长说明该厂一方面是国家企业性质，一方面又是军工工厂性质，一方面要担任民营通信机的修配，一方面又要供应前线，支援战争。　　（商恺）
