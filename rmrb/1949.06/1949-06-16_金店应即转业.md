　　Gold Shops Should Convert Their Businesses Promptly
    Zhou
    Before the War of Resistance, there were 73 gold shops in Tianjin. During the eight years of the war, 68 more were added. After the surrender of the Japanese invaders, another 31 were added, bringing the total to 172 at the time of liberation. Why did gold shops experience such abnormal prosperity during the eleven years of war destruction and enemy looting, when national industry and commerce were declining, social wealth was decreasing, and the masses were becoming poorer day by day? This is because these gold shops were not mainly making jewelry or gold and silver utensils for people (due to poverty, the demand for such gold and silver ornaments and utensils was decreasing day by day), but mainly engaging in gold and silver speculation. At that time, due to the rule of the enemy and puppets, people could not make a living from legitimate production activities, and turned to speculation. Gold and silver became one of the main objects of speculation at that time, and the gold shop industry experienced an abnormal development in gold and silver speculation, which had its objective reasons. However, in today's post-liberation era, after imperialism, bureaucratic capital, and feudal forces have been destroyed by the people, and the development of legitimate industry and commerce has good and favorable conditions, engaging in gold and silver speculation again is not only inappropriate, but also a criminal act. The Chinese nation's vast laboring people's advocacy of a life of diligence and thrift will undoubtedly be fully developed in the new Chinese liberated areas. Therefore, gold shops will certainly be unwelcome. The best way out for them is to promptly and quickly use their existing capital and manpower to convert to legitimate industrial and commercial activities that are beneficial to the people's livelihood. Obviously, sitting idle and consuming one's resources is something that practitioners are unwilling to do. Continuing to speculate will certainly not be tolerated by the people and the government. Therefore, the result of hesitation and indecision will only be a waste of manpower and financial resources. This is extremely unfavorable not only to the whole society, but especially to gold shop operators. It is hoped that they will make a decision quickly and convert their businesses as soon as possible.

　　金店应即转业
    舟
    抗战前天津有金店七十三家，抗战八年中增加了六十八家日寇投降后，又新增三十一家，到解放时共有一百七十二家。为什么在战争破坏与敌伪掠夺的十一年中民族工商业日益凋敝，社会财富日益减少，广大群众一天比一天更加贫困的情况下，金店却呈现着如此畸形的繁荣呢？这是因为这些金店，它们并不是为人作首饰或金银用具（因为穷的关系，这种金饰和金银用具的需求是一天一天的减少了），而主要的是作金银的投机买卖。在当时由于敌伪的统治，人们不能从正当的生产事业中谋取生活，乃转而从事投机，金银乃成为当时主要投机对象之一，金店业便都在金银投机中得到一个畸形的发展，自有其客观原因在。但在解放后的今天，帝国主义、官僚资本、封建势力，已为人民所摧毁，正当工商业之发展，有了很好有利条件之后，再从事于金银投机，便不仅是不应该，而且是一种犯罪行为了。中华民族广大劳动人民崇尚勤劳俭朴的生活习惯，无疑将在新中国解放区得到充分的发扬。因此，金店将定为人所不欢迎。其最好的出路，就在于及时迅速的以其现有资力、人力，转而从事有利于国民生计的正当的工商业。很显然，坐吃山空，当为从业者所不愿。而继续投机，定为人民和政府所不容。所以徘徊犹豫的结果，将不过是人力和财力的浪费而已。这不仅对整个社会，尤其对金店经营者，是十分不利的。希望他们速下决心，早日转业。
