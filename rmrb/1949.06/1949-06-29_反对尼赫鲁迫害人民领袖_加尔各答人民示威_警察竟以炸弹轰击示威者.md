Xinhua News Agency, Peiping, 28th: The people of Calcutta and its surrounding areas in India have launched a struggle against the Nehru government's persecution of Indian people's leaders. According to reports from British and French news agencies, on the 27th, Calcutta demonstrators, led by women, marched towards the Bengal government building in the city's central district, shouting slogans to protest the police's recent atrocity of opening fire on political prisoners in Calcutta jail. The demonstrators shouted slogans such as "Down with British Imperialism." When the police bombarded the demonstrators with tear gas and bombs, the demonstrators resisted with stones and bricks.

On the 25th, in the village of Tirantiriya, 15 miles from Calcutta, when the Nehru government police unreasonably arrested a local mass leader, villagers gathered to resist the police and rescued the arrested person. In the conflict, five policemen were injured, including a deputy police officer, and five villagers were killed or injured. On the 26th, near Suri, 120 miles northwest of Calcutta, a police station that arrested local people's leaders was attacked with bows and arrows by hundreds of villagers (including members of the Santal minority). Two people were killed and several injured in the conflict.

Furthermore: At an American-owned factory in the northern district of Calcutta, on the 27th, a battle broke out between striking workers and the police, resulting in injuries to an assistant police chief and seven police officers.
