Beiping City Inspects Factory Security Work
　　Some Factories Still Complacent and Urgently Need Correction
　　[This newspaper reported] (News from this newspaper) The Preparatory Committee of the Beiping City Federation of Trade Unions' Industrial Union Security Department convened a joint meeting of security cadres from various public factories yesterday (the 17th) to inspect and study security work. Since May, various factories have achieved considerable success in security work; however, some factories still do not pay enough attention to this. For example, some factories hastily established militia teams without conducting publicity and education, causing ideological confusion among workers, who were afraid of being held responsible if something went wrong. In terms of organizational methods, the steps taken by each factory were also not uniform: some were based on voluntary registration, some were designated by leaders, and some were unconditional elections without careful screening, resulting in a rather complex composition of the militia teams. Some factories were tight at first but then relaxed, failing to recognize security work as a regular task. Based on the above situation, after discussion, the Industrial Union Security Department put forward the following opinions: It is necessary to recognize the importance of factory security work ideologically, overcome past political complacency and laissez-faire in work, and strengthen the leadership of security work. It is essential to rely on the masses, mobilize the masses, and conduct thorough publicity and education to protect the interests of the masses on the basis of mass awareness, rather than relying on a few individuals. Clear regulations were also made regarding organizational leadership: a security committee should be established under the factory management committee, composed of the administrative head, the Party branch secretary, the chairman of the trade union, the security committee member of the Party branch, and the security team leader. The former militia teams will be renamed factory security teams, and team members must undergo strict screening. In addition, all factories must organize employees and team members to conduct in-depth discussions on the circular issued by the North China People's Government regarding the fire at the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant, combined with the actual situation of each factory, to examine attitudes toward security work ideologically and behaviorally, and oppose bureaucracy and complacency.

　　平市检查工厂保卫工作
  　有些厂仍然麻痹亟须纠正
    【本报讯】北平市总工会筹委会产业工会保卫部于昨日（十七日）召集各公营工厂保卫干部联席会，检查研究保卫工作。自五月份以来，各厂保卫工作已获得了不少成绩；但仍有一些工厂对此不够重视。例如有的厂未进行宣传教育，即草率成立纠察队，引起工人思想混乱，怕出了事负不起责任。在组织方法上，各厂步调也不统一：有的是自动报名，有的是领导指定，还有的是无条件的选举，未经细心审查，使纠察队成份相当复杂。还有的厂子先紧后松，未将保卫工作认成经常工作。根据以上情况，经过大家讨论，产业工会保卫部特提出如下意见：要从思想上去认识工厂保卫工作的重要性，克服过去政治上的麻痹与工作中的自流，加强保卫工作的领导。必须依靠群众，发动群众，进行充分的宣传教育，在群众自觉基础上保卫群众利益，而不是靠几个人做。关于组织领导问题，也作了明确的规定：即工厂管理委员会下设保卫委员会，由行政首长、党的支书、工会主任、党的支部保卫委员、保卫队长共同组成，过去的纠察队改名为工厂保卫队，队员要经过严格审查。另外对华北人民政府所发关于石景山钢铁厂失火事件的通令，各厂必须组织职工队员进行深刻讨论，结合各厂实际情形，从思想上行动上察查对保卫工作的态度，反对官僚主义与麻痹现象。　　（恺）
