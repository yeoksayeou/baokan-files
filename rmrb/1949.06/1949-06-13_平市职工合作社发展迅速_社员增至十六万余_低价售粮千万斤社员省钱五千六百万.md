  Rapid Development of the Ping City Workers' Cooperative
    Membership Increases to Over 160,000
    Low-Priced Grain Sales of Ten Million Jin Save Members 56 Million Yuan
    [Our Newspaper's Report] With the strong support of the People's Government, the Beijing (Peiping) Municipal Workers' Consumer Cooperative has achieved rapid development. According to statistics from June 3rd of this month, 72 cooperatives have been successively established throughout the city, including 51 in state-owned enterprises and factories, 17 in government agencies, 2 in schools, and 2 in private factories. A total of 163,958 workers and their family members have become shareholders. In March, April, and May, each member purchased an average of 40 to 60 jin of food grains per month from the cooperative, at prices 6% to 15% lower than market prices. Since March, the cooperatives have successively purchased 10,763,613 jin of flour, rice, and various coarse grains, as well as large quantities of oil and salt, from trade companies. Grain alone has saved members 56,123,925 yuan in intermediate exploitation. They have also served as a powerful assistant to state-owned trading companies in the struggle to combat speculative merchants and maintain stable price increases. To better serve members, the Municipal Cooperative Federation conducted a preliminary survey of the daily necessities of workers in several factories in May. It was found that workers' wage consumption averaged about 30% to 80% on staple foods, with the remaining 70% to 20% spent on daily necessities and other items. Therefore, completing the supply of food grains is only one aspect of the consumer cooperative's mission. It is necessary to further expand the supply of daily necessities to meet the needs of members. In June, the Municipal Cooperative Federation began to place the supply of daily necessities on an equal footing with the supply of food grains. To better develop business, the Municipal Cooperative Federation has also focused on guiding the cooperatives to mobilize members to implement democratic management and correct the past tendency in some units to emphasize top-down organization and neglect mass mobilization. In the future, the trade union will strengthen member education to make each member recognize that the cooperative is their own welfare organization, not some "organ above." The Municipal Cooperative Federation is also strengthening guidance for cadres, using the power of the masses to supervise and correct the bureaucratic management methods of some cooperative cadres in the past. Currently, 16 units, including the Beijing (Peiping) Telecommunications Bureau, have convened member representative conferences, democratically elected cooperative affairs committees, and implemented a system of democratic centralism. They have mobilized members to help cooperative cadres manage various businesses that are convenient for members and overcome the idea of solely relying on assistance from higher levels in some units.

　　平市职工合作社发展迅速
  　社员增至十六万余
    低价售粮千万斤社员省钱五千六百万
    【本报讯】北平市职工消费合作社在人民政府大力扶植下，已获得迅速发展。据本月三日统计，全市已陆续成立七十二所，其中包括公营企业工厂五十一所，机关十七所，学校两所，私营工场两所。共有十六万三千九百五十八名职工及职工家属入股为社员。三、四、五三个月，每个社员每月平均向合作社购得低于市价百分之六到百分之十五的食粮四十斤至六十斤。各社从三月到现在，已从贸易公司陆续批发面粉、大米和各种杂粮一千零七十六万三千六百一十三斤和大批油盐。单食粮一项，已使社员少受五千六百一十二万三千九百二十五元的中间剥削。在打击投机商人及保持物价平稳上升的斗争上，也作了国营贸易公司有力的助手。为更好的服务社员，五月份市合作总社又在几个工厂作了职工生活日用必需品的初步调查，知道职工的工资消费在主食品上的平均约占百分之三十到百分之八十，其剩余的百分之七十到百分之二十则消费在日用品及其它方面。故完成食粮的供给，仅是做了消费合作社任务的一方面，必须进一步的开展日用品的供给业务，才能满足社员的需要。市合作总社六月份已开始把供给日用品和供给食粮放在同等重要的地位。为更好的发展业务，市合作总社已同时注意领导各社发动社员，实行民主管理，纠正过去一段工作中某些单位偏重由上而下的组织，忽视发动群众的偏向。今后将通过职工会加强社员教育，使每个社员认识合作社是自己的福利组织，并不是什么“上面的机关”。市合作总社同时也加强对干部的指导。以群众的力量监督纠正过去某些社干部经营方式方法的机关化。现已有北平电信局等十六个单位召开了社员代表大会，民主选举了社务委员会，实行民主集中的管理制。发动社员帮助合作社干部经营对社员方便的各种业务。克服某些单位单纯依靠上级扶助的思想。
