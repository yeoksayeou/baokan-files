    (A) If this is the case, then within the system of social material living conditions, what is the main force that determines the appearance of society, the nature of the social system, and the development of society from one system to another?

    According to historical materialism, this force is the way people obtain the necessities of life, the mode of production of material resources such as food, clothing, shoes, housing, fuel, and production tools necessary for social life and development.

    In order to live, there is a need for food, clothing, shoes, housing, fuel, and so on. To have these material resources, it is necessary to produce them. And to produce them, there is a need for various production tools that people use to produce food, clothing, shoes, housing, and fuel, etc., a need to be good at producing these tools, and a need to be good at using these tools.

    The production tools used in the production of material resources, as well as the people who, with considerable production experience and labor skills, operate the production tools and realize the production of material resources—the sum of these elements constitutes the productive forces of society.

    But productive forces are only one aspect of production, one aspect of the mode of production, which represents the relationship between people and the objects they use to produce material resources and the forces of nature. The struggle between people and nature, as well as the utilization of nature to produce material resources, is not carried out by individuals in isolation from each other, but jointly in units of groups and societies. Therefore, production is always social production, under any circumstances and conditions. When people realize the production of material resources, they also establish certain interrelationships within the production process, that is, certain relations of production. These relationships may be relationships of cooperation and mutual assistance among people who are not exploited, relationships of rule and obedience, and finally, transitional relationships from one form of production relations to another. However, no matter what nature the relations of production take, they are, at all times and under all systems, a necessary element of production, just like the productive forces of society.

    Marx said:

    "In production, people not only affect nature but also each other. They cannot produce if they do not combine in a certain way and exchange their activities with each other. In order to realize production, people enter into definite connections and relations; only through these social connections and social relations can there be a relationship between people and nature, and only then can there be production." ("Marx and Engels Collected Works," Volume 5, page 429)

    Therefore, production, the mode of production, encompasses both the productive forces of society and the relations of production, embodying the unity of the two in the process of material production.

    (B) The first characteristic of production is that it never stays fixed in one place for long, but is always in a state of change and development. At the same time, changes in the mode of production inevitably lead to changes in the entire social system, social thought, political views, and political system, that is, to the transformation of the entire social and political structure. People in different stages of development have different modes of production, or, to put it crudely, live different kinds of lives. Under the primitive commune system, there is one mode of production, under the slave system there is another mode of production, under the feudal system there is a third mode of production, and so on. At the same time, people's social systems, their spiritual lives, their views, and their political systems are also different in accordance with this.

    As the social mode of production is, so the society itself will be in essence, and so the social ideas and theories, political views, and political systems will be.

    Or, to put it crudely: As people's way of life is, so will be people's way of thinking.

    That is to say, the history of social development is first of all the history of the development of production, the history of the development of the mode of production through the ages, the history of the development of productive forces and people's relations of production.

    From this, it can be seen that the history of social development is also the history of the material producers themselves, that is, the history of the working masses who are the basic forces in the production process and realize the production of the material resources necessary for social survival.

    From this, it can be seen that if historical science wants to become a true science, it can no longer reduce the history of social development to the actions of emperors, kings, generals, and ministers, or to the actions of "aggressors" and "conquerors" of the state, but should first study the history of material producers, the history of the working masses, and the history of the people of all countries.

    From this, it can be seen that the key to studying the laws of social history is not to seek them in people's minds, in social views and thoughts, but to seek them in the mode of production adopted by society in each specific historical period, that is, in the economy of society.

    From this, it can be concluded that the primary task of historical science is to study and reveal the laws of production, the laws governing the development of productive forces and relations of production, and the laws governing social and economic development. (History of the CPSU, pp. 149-154)

    Although the old Chinese historical materials are very rich, most of them record the actions of emperors and generals, and the activities of the rise and fall of dynasties, but rarely record social and economic facts, which is a major defect in the study of Chinese history.

    Some Chinese historians have set nature and human society against each other, believing that the history of human society is limited to recording the results of spiritual activities. As Liang Qichao said:

    "Human beings act to survive, and survive to act. When activity ceases, the way of man will almost cease. All activity takes the ability to act as its substance and what is acted upon as its form. History is the synthesis of the various substances of those who act and the various forms expressed by their activities, to form a structured narrative. Therefore, non-active matters—such as celestial phenomena, terrain, etc., which belong to natural phenomena—are not within the scope of history; on the contrary, all active matters—those produced by human emotions, intellect, and will—are the forms of activity, that is, all within the scope of history." (Liang Qichao: "Methods of Studying Chinese History," page 1)

    To seek the history of human society not in the mode of production of material producers—that is, the laboring people—but in human emotions, intellect, and consciousness—that is, in the thoughts, actions, words, and deeds produced by the human brain, the so-called cultural achievements—this idealistic viewpoint fundamentally cannot understand the true history of human society.

　　中国历史教程绪论
    吴玉章
  　二、研究中国历史的方法（续九）
    （甲）既然如此，那末在社会物质生活条件体系中，究竟什么是决定社会面貌，决定社会制度性质，决定社会由这一制度发展为另一制度的主要力量呢？
    这样的力量，据历史唯物主义看来，便是人们生存所必需的生活资料谋得方式，便是社会生活和发展所必需的食品、衣服、靴鞋、住房、燃料和生产工具等等物质资料生产方式。
    为要生活，就需要有食品、衣服、靴鞋、住房和燃料等等，为要有这些物质资料，就必需生产它们，而为要生产它们，就需要有人们所利用来生产食品、衣服、靴鞋、住房和燃料等等的种种生产工具，就需要善于生产这些工具，就需要善于使用这些工具。
    生产物质资料时所使用的生产工具，以及因有相当生产经验和劳动技能而发动着生产工具并实现着物质资料生产的人，——这些要素总合起来，便构成为社会的生产力。
    但生产力还只是生产的一方面，生产方式的一方面，其所表示的是人们对于他们所利用来生产物质资料的物件和自然界力量间的关系。生产的另一方面，生产方式的另一方面，便是人们彼此在生产过程中发生的关系，即人们的生产关系。人们和自然界斗争以及利用自然界来生产物质资料，并不是彼此孤立，彼此隔绝，各人单独进行，而是以团体为单位，以社会为单位来共同进行的。因此，生产在任何时候和任何条件下都是社会的生产。人们在实现物质资料生产时，也就建立彼此间在生产内部的某种相互关系，即某种生产关系。这些关系可能是不受剥削的人们彼此间的合作和互助关系，可能是统治和服从的关系，最后，也可能是由一种生产关系形式过渡到另一种生产关系形式的过渡关系。可是，不管生产关系带着怎样的性质，而它们在任何时候和在任何制度下，都如社会的生产力一样是生产的必要原素。
    马克思说：
    “人们在生产中不仅影响着自然界，而且彼此互相影响着。他们如果不用相当方式结合起来共同活动和互相交换其活动，便不能生产。为了实现生产，人们便发生一定的联系和关系，只有经过这些社会联系和社会关系，才会有人们对于自然界的关系存在，才会有生产。”（“马恩全集”，第五卷，第四二九页）
    所以，生产，生产方式是把社会的生产力和人们的生产关系两者都包含在内，而体现着两者在物质资料生产过程中的统一。
    （乙）生产的第一个特点就是它永远也不会长久停留在一点上，而是始终处在变更和发展状态中，同时生产方式中的变更又必然引起全部社会制度，社会思想，政治观点和政治制度之变更，即引起全部社会的和政治的结构的改造。人们在各个不同的发展阶段上有着各个不同的生产方式，或者粗浅一点说，过着各种不同样式的生活。在原始公社制度下有一种生产方式，在奴隶制度下有另一种生产方式，在封建制度下有第三种生产方式，余此类推。同时，人们的社会制度，他们的精神生活，他们的观点，他们的政治制度，也与此适应而各不相同。
    社会的生产方式怎样，社会本身在基本上也就会怎样，社会的思想和理论，政治观点和政治制度也就会怎样。
    或者粗浅一点说：人们的生活样式怎样，人们的思想样式也就会怎样。
    这就是说，社会发展史首先便是生产发展史，数千百年来新陈代谢的生产方式发展史，生产力和人们生产关系发展史。
    由此可见，社会发展史同时也就是物质资料生产者本身的历史，即身为生产过程中基本力量并实现着社会生存所必需物质资料生产的那些劳动群众的历史。
    由此可见，历史科学要想成为真正的科学，便不能再把社会发展史归结为帝王将相的行动，归结为国家“侵略者”和“征服者”的行动，而是首先应当研究物质资料生产者的历史，劳动群众的历史，各国人民的历史。
    由此可见，研究社会历史规律的关键，并不是要到人们的头脑中，到社会的观点和思想中去探求，而是要到社会在每个一定历史时期所采取的生产方式中，即要到社会的经济中去探求。
    由此可见，历史科学的首要任务是要研究和揭示生产的规律，生产力与生产关系发展的规律，社会经济发展的规律。（联共党史，一四九——一五四页）
    中国旧历史材料虽然很丰富，但大部是记载帝王与将相的行动，记载朝代兴亡的活动，而很少记载社会经济的事实，这是研究中国历史的一个大缺陷。
    中国有些历史家把自然界与人类社会对立起来，以为人类社会的历史只限于记载精神活动的结果。如梁启超说：
    “人类为生存而活动，亦为活动而生存。活动休止，则人道或几乎息矣。凡活动，以能活动者为体，以所活动者为相。史也者，综合彼等与活动者之种种体，与其活动所表现之种种相，而成一有结构的叙述者也。是故非活动的事项——例如天象、地形等，属于自然界现象者，皆非史的范围；反之，凡活动的事项——人类情感理智意志所产生者，皆活动之相，即皆史的范围也。”（梁启超者：“中国历史研究法”一页）
    把人类社会历史不在致力于物质资料生产者——即劳动民众的生产方式中去找寻，而在人类情感理智意识——即人类头脑所产生的思想动作言行即所谓文化事功中去找寻，这种唯心论的观点，根本就不能了解人类社会真正的历史。
