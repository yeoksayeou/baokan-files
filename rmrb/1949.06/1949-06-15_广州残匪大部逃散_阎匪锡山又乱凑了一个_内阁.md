Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 14th. The remnant Kuomintang bandit gangs in Guangzhou have mostly scattered. Over eighty percent of the pseudo-legislators in Guangzhou have fled the city. The archives and families of the bandit party's "Central Party Headquarters" have been transported to Taiwan and Chongqing separately. The pseudo-"Executive Yuan" decided in a meeting on the 6th to cut staff by two-thirds in all agencies and ordered that seven-tenths of the retained personnel be sent to Chongqing with utmost speed. The pseudo-"Southwest Military and Political Office" is busy preparing housing for the pseudo-"Presidential Office" and the pseudo-"Ministry of National Defense," which are about to flee from Guangzhou to Chongqing. On the 12th, amidst the chaotic situation of the Guangzhou bandit gang's headlong flight, bandit Yan Xishan and a few other war criminals hastily cobbled together a so-called "cabinet." Yan himself concurrently serves as the so-called "Minister of National Defense," Zhu Jiahua, one of the CC Clique fascist bandit leaders, became the so-called "Vice President of the Executive Yuan," and Hu Shih, an American imperialist running dog who fled to the United States, became the so-called "Minister of Foreign Affairs." The bandit party's "Central Political Committee" also decided on the 11th to establish a so-called "Supreme Decision-Making Committee," with bandit Chiang and the pseudo-"Acting President" Li Zongren serving as chairman and vice-chairman, respectively, in order to strengthen bandit Chiang's control over the remnant Kuomintang bandit gangs.

　　广州残匪大部逃散
  　阎匪锡山又乱凑了一个“内阁”
    【新华社北平十四日电】广州残余国民党匪帮已经大部逃散。在广州的伪立委已有百分之八十以上逃离广州。匪党“中央党部”的档案、眷属已分别运往台湾、重庆。伪“行政院”六日会议中即已决定各机关裁员三分之二，并令将留用人员的十分之七火速送往重庆。伪“西南军政长官公署”正忙着为即将由广州逃往重庆的伪“总统府”、伪“国防部”等筹备房屋。十二日阎匪锡山在广州匪帮鸡飞狗走的混乱局面下和另外几个战犯胡乱凑起一个所谓“内阁”来，阎自兼所谓“国防部长”，ＣＣ团法西斯匪首之一朱家骅作了所谓“行政院副院长”，逃亡在美的美帝国主义走狗胡适作了所谓“外交部长”。匪党“中政会”并于十一日决定成立所谓“最高决策委员会”，以蒋贼和伪“代总统”李宗仁分任正副主席，以加强蒋贼对残余国民党匪帮的控制。
