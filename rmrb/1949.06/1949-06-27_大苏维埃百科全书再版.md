The Soviet Council of Ministers decided to re-publish the "Great Soviet Encyclopedia" in mid-February of this year.

The Soviet Council of Ministers pointed out that the first edition of the "Great Soviet Encyclopedia" had serious shortcomings. These shortcomings were: most of the entries were outdated and did not correspond to the current level of Soviet science and culture; contained serious theoretical and political errors; failed to reflect the most significant changes in Soviet and foreign life; contained many entries that were excessively inflated, while suffering from the defect of incomplete nomenclature; and many important phenomena, concepts, and terms were not explained, etc.

Therefore, the Soviet Council of Ministers believed that it was necessary to start re-publishing the Great Soviet Encyclopedia to eliminate these errors and shortcomings of the first edition. It stipulates that the content of the second edition of the "Great Soviet Encyclopedia" should become a systematic encyclopedia of socio-economic and natural sciences, technology, military and other knowledge, and become an encyclopedia for the broad Soviet intelligentsia; it should extensively explain the victory of Soviet socialism with worldwide historical significance, and the achievements of the Soviet Union in economy, science, culture, and art; it should explain in detail the superiority of socialist culture over the culture of the capitalist world; it should rely on the theories of Marxism-Leninism to carry out party criticism of modern reactionary bourgeois trends in science and technology.

The Soviet Council of Ministers determined that the second edition of the Great Soviet Encyclopedia would be fifty volumes, each volume with fifty printed pages, and each volume printed with 300,000 copies. In order to more fully explain the problems of science and technology, it is planned to increase the number of words in the second edition from 65,000 to 100,000.

The Soviet Council of Ministers instructed the General Editorial Board of the Soviet Encyclopedia to complete the second edition within six years (1949 to 1954), publishing three volumes in 1949, and ten volumes each year from 1950.

The Soviet Council of Ministers proposed that the State Scientific Research Institute of "Soviet Encyclopedia" be reorganized into the State Scientific Publishing Bureau of "Great Soviet Encyclopedia", and that the publishing bureau be transferred to the jurisdiction of the General Editorial Board of the "Great Soviet Encyclopedia". The General Editorial Board of the "Great Soviet Encyclopedia" shall also be responsible for the various other encyclopedias published by the State Scientific Publishing Bureau of "Great Soviet Encyclopedia".

The General Editorial Board of the "Great Soviet Encyclopedia" is subordinate to the Soviet Council of Ministers.

Based on past experience, the system of paying for manuscripts according to the number of pages has caused the inflation of the number of words and the reduction of the quality of papers and annotations. Therefore, the Soviet Council of Ministers abolished this manuscript fee system, believing it to be incorrect. It suggested adopting a new manuscript fee system, determining that: papers and annotations should be paid according to the quality, the importance and complexity of the subject matter, and whether the task is completed on time, and only if they are considered satisfactory in quality. The level of quality and the standard of manuscript fees shall be determined by the editors-in-chief of the relevant departments of the encyclopedia, and finally approved by the General Editorial Board.

The number of papers and annotations shall be determined in advance by the General Editorial Board of the "Great Soviet Encyclopedia" when compiling the dictionary.

The Soviet Council of Ministers approved the manuscript fee rates for papers and annotations of the "Great Soviet Encyclopedia" proposed by the General Editorial Board.

In addition, Academician S.I. Vavilov was approved as the editor-in-chief of the Great Soviet Encyclopedia; A.I. Levin was approved as the manager of the State Scientific Publishing Bureau of the "Great Soviet Encyclopedia".

　　大苏维埃百科全书再版
    苏联部长会议于本年二月中旬曾决定“大苏维埃百科全书”再版。
    苏联部长会议指出，已出版的“大苏维埃百科全书”第一版有严重的缺点。这些缺点是：大部份的条文均已陈旧，与苏维埃科学与文化的现有水平不相适应；含有严重的理论错误与政治错误；没有反映出苏联生活中及外国生活中最巨大的变化；含有许多规模过分膨胀的条文，同时却患名词不完全的弊病；许多重要的现象、概念、术语，均未予以解释等。
    因此，苏联部长会议认为必须着手再版大苏维埃百科全书，消除第一版的这些错误和缺点。规定第二版“大苏维埃百科全书”的内容应该成为社会经济和自然科学、技术、军事等知识的有系统的全书，成为广大的苏维埃知识分子的百科大全；应该广泛地阐明苏联社会主义的有全世界历史意义的胜利，及苏联在经济、科学、文化、艺术各方面的成就；应该详尽地说明社会主义文化高出于资本主义世界文化的优越性；应该依靠马克思、列宁主义的理论，对于科学与技术各方面现代反动的资产阶级潮流予以党的批评。
    苏联部长会议确定大苏维埃百科全书第二版为五十卷，每卷五十印刷页，每卷印行三十万本。为了能更完全地阐明科学与技术的问题，拟将第二版字数自六万五千字增加为十万字。
    苏联部长会议责成苏维埃大百科全书总编辑部准备将第二版于六年内（一九四九年至一九五四年）出齐，一九四九年出版三卷，自一九五○年起，每年出版十卷。
    苏联部长会议建议将国立“苏维埃百科全书”科学研究院改组为国立“大苏维埃百科全书”科学出版局，并将该出版局移交“大苏维埃百科全书”总编辑部管辖。“国立大苏维埃百科全书”科学出版局所出版的其他各种百科全书，亦由“大苏维埃百科全书”总编辑部负责。
    “大苏维埃百科全书”总编辑部隶属于苏联部长会议。
    根据过去经验，稿件按页付酬的制度，造成了论文与注释字数的膨胀与质量的降低。因此，苏联部长会议废除了这种稿费制度，认为是不正确的。它建议采行新的稿费制度，确定：论文和注释，依质量高低、题材重要性及复杂性、是否按期完成任务等条件，并且只有在它们在质量上被认为满意的场合下，才可付酬。质量的高低和稿费标准，由百科全书各有关部门主编决定，由总编辑部最后批准。
    论文与注释的多少，由“大苏维埃百科全书”总编辑部在编写该辞典时事先确定。
    苏联部长会议批准了总编辑部所建议的“大苏维埃百科全书”论文与注释的稿费率。
    另外，由科学院会员Ｓ·Ｉ瓦维诺夫被批准为大苏维埃百科全书总编辑；Ａ·Ｉ·列文被批准为国立“大苏维埃百科全书”科学出版局经理。
