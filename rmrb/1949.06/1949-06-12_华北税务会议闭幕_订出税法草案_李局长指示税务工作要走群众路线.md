[This Newspaper's Report] The Second North China Tax Conference victoriously concluded on the 8th. From the middle of last month, representatives from various regions arrived in Ping [Beiping, i.e. Beijing] one after another, and since May 10th, various symposiums were held continuously, extensively soliciting opinions from democratic figures, industrialists and businessmen in the Pingjin [Beiping and Tianjin] area, and taxpayers regarding tax policies. The formal conference opened on May 24th. During the conference, issues related to tax policies, tax laws, organizational structure, and tasks were carefully discussed. After repeated discussions and revisions, various draft tax laws were written, and a work plan for this year was formulated.

On the 8th of this month, Director Li of the General Taxation Bureau delivered a concluding report. He said: The conference, based on the experience we have accumulated in our work and absorbing opinions from various parties, conducted enthusiastic discussions; re-revised the draft, re-verified the tasks, revised the organizational structure, unified the management of bills and certificates and the accounting system, and formulated various tax collection procedures. Director Li emphasized that in tax work, we must strive for unity from our policies to our specific work, and oppose the phenomenon of disorganization, lack of discipline, and each doing their own thing. We should also strengthen investigation and research, promote democracy, listen to opinions from all parties, always care about the interests of the masses, follow the mass line, and strengthen the quality education of revolutionary personnel to prevent corruption. He called on tax work cadres, especially senior cadres, to overcome self-righteous empiricism and blindness in their work, and to adhere to the reporting and requesting instructions system.

Guest Mr. Ling Dating spoke, stating that this conference was a rich and vivid learning opportunity for him personally, negating the book knowledge he had learned in the past - a comparison of various countries' finances, because it would not connect to reality.

Comrades Liang Yao, Li Zhouxing and others unanimously agreed in their speeches that following the mass line is a necessary and crucial key to doing a good job in tax work today. Tax policy should be based on the happiness and interests of the vast majority of the people, and tax workers should serve the people wholeheartedly. Only in this way can we distinguish the essential differences between our tax work and that of the Kuomintang. The conference victoriously concluded at 4 p.m.

　　华北税务会议闭幕
  　订出税法草案
  　李局长指示税务工作要走群众路线
    【本报讯】华北二届税务会议已于八日胜利闭幕。上月中旬，各地参加会议的代表陆续抵平，自五月十日起，即连续举行各种座谈会，广泛征集听取民主人士暨平津两地工商业家及纳税义务人对税政的意见。正式会议于五月二十四日开幕，在会议过程中审慎地讨论了有关税政、税法、组织机构、任务等问题，经过再次研讨修改，写成各种税法草案，并制订了本年度的工作计划方案。
    本月八日，由务税总局李局长作总结报告。他说：会议根据我们在工作中积累的经验，并吸取各方面的意见，进行了热烈的讨论；再次修订草案，从新核订任务，修订组织机构，统一了票证管理和会计制度，并拟订了各种征税的手续法等。李局长着重指出：在税务工作中，从我们的政策到具体工作，要力求统一，反对无组织无纪律各自为政的现象。并应加强调查研究，发扬民主，倾听各方面的意见，时时关心群众利益，走群众路线，并须加强革命人员品质教育，防止贪污腐化。他号召税务工作干部，尤其是高级干部须克服自以为是的经验主义和工作中的盲目性，要坚持报告请示制度。
    来宾凌大挺先生讲话，他认为这次会议对他个人是一丰富生动的学习机会，否定了自己过去所学的书本知识——各国财政比较，因为它是不会连系实际的。
    梁耀、李周行同志等在发言中一致认为：走群众路线是今天搞好税政工作必需而紧要的关键。税政应以最大多数人民的幸福利益为依归，税务工作者应全心全意为人民服务。只有这样，才能区别我们的税收工作和国民党的税收有什么本质的不同。大会于下午四时胜利闭幕。
