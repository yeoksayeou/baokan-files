　　U.S. Imperialism Continues to Aid Remnant Bandits
  　Large Quantities of Military Supplies Shipped to Taiwan
    [Xinhua News Agency, Peiping, 26th] U.S. imperialism continues to supply large quantities of military supplies to the remnant Kuomintang bandit gangs. According to a Washington dispatch from the Associated Press on the 21st, military supplies and weapons purchased in the United States by the Kuomintang bandit gangs with the "Aid to China" funds allocated last April are now being shipped to Taiwan at the request of the Chiang bandits. This transportation will likely continue for several months. Most of the weapons are transported from Charleston, South Carolina, by U.S. Army transport ships and Navy vessels. It is reported that the U.S. military transport ship "Joseph V. Fernald" was docked in Charleston harbor from the 6th to the 13th of this month to load bombs, and then sailed to the Pacific coast to load explosives for shipment to Taiwan. This fact clearly shows that the U.S. imperialists are still actively helping the remnant Kuomintang bandit gangs behind the scenes to carry out their death throes.

　　美帝继续援助残余匪帮
  　大批军火运台
    【新华社北平二十六日电】美帝国主义继续以大量军火供应残余国民党匪帮。据美联社华盛顿二十一日消息披露：国民党匪帮用美国去年四月“援华”拨款而在美所购买的军火武器，现已按照蒋贼的要求，运往台湾。此项运输大概会继续数月之久。大部武器均由南卡罗来纳州的查理士敦城以美国陆军运输舰与海军船舰运送。据息，美军运输舰约瑟夫·佛麦芮尔号于本月六日到十三日一直泊在查理士敦港口装载炸弹，然后又开赴太平洋海岸装载炸药，以便运往台湾。此一事实，清楚地说明了美帝国主义者仍在幕后积极援助残余国民党匪帮进行垂死挣扎。
