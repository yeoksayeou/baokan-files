(Taihang Electric Dispatch) The locust eradication campaign in Anyang has now concluded victoriously. The locust plague in the county occurred in early February, and by March it had spread throughout the county, affecting ten districts (out of the county's eleven districts) and one hundred and twenty-five villages. Upon discovery, the Fifth Special District Office immediately dispatched cadres to guide the eradication effort. Anyang County also instructed all districts and villages to mobilize urgently, establish locust eradication leadership organizations, and put forward the slogan: "Eradicating locusts is like fighting fire, protecting seedlings is like protecting lives." Locust eradication work teams were organized and sent to the eighth and ninth districts, where the plague was most severe, to gain experience and promote the effort throughout the county. As of now, with the exception of fifty-one villages where there are still residual grasshoppers, the egg-digging and nymph-killing efforts have basically ended in the remaining seventy-four villages. The masses participated in the locust eradication very enthusiastically. According to incomplete statistics from thirty-two villages in four districts alone, more than 12,300 men and women participated in the locust eradication, clearing an area of more than 5,900 mu.

　　安阳蝗害基本剿灭
    【太行电】安阳剿蝗运动，现已胜利结束。该县蝗害发生在二月初旬，到三月间全县普遍发生，面达十个区（全县共十一个区）一百二十五个村。当发现后，五专署即派干部前往指导剿灭，安阳县也指示各区村紧急动员，成立剿蝗领导组织，提出：“灭蝗如灭火，保苗如保命”的口号，并组织剿蝗工作小组，分赴蝗害严重的八、九区创造经验推动全县。截至目前，除五十一个村尚有残余蚂蚱外，其余七十四个村的刨卵灭蝻基本结束。群众参加剿蝗十分踊跃，仅据四个区三十二个村不完全统计：参加剿蝗的男女群众即达一万二千三百余人，剿打面积五千九百余亩。
