Xinhua News Agency, Hangzhou, 9th: The People's Liberation Army, having reached Wenzhou in southern Zhejiang, has been warmly welcomed by the local people. Even before the People's Liberation Army crossed the river on its southern expedition, the people of the counties in southern Zhejiang, together with the local people's guerrillas and the democratic governments of the guerrilla base areas, under the slogan of "Welcoming the People's Liberation Army to the South," raised a large amount of grain, military shoes, and vegetables. The people of Yueqing County handed over hundreds of thousands of catties of rice and firewood in just a few days. The wife of farmer Chou Xiaokun, who was killed by the Kuomintang bandits, despite her difficult family circumstances, still borrowed two dou of wheat from relatives and friends to support the army, and made five pairs of military shoes to give to the People's Liberation Army who avenged her. After the democratic women's federations in the vast rural areas launched the "One Pair of Shoes Movement," every woman made three to five pairs of shoes to comfort the army. Many working women in Ruian County embroidered words like "We have been liberated, thanks to you (referring to the People's Liberation Army)" and "You are our saviors" on the military shoes. Working women in Pingyang County also specially made a large number of "comfort bags," filled with cigarettes, matches, and soap and other comfort items. When the People's Liberation Army entered the southern Zhejiang area, the people rushed to comfort the People's Liberation Army everywhere, as if reunited with long-lost relatives. When the vanguard of the People's Liberation Army sailed near Wenzhou, firecrackers exploded on the shore, and the people eagerly called for the troops to come ashore. Representatives of people's organizations from Tengqiaokou in Lishui County and Pingyang, Ruian, and other counties traveled long distances to the People's Liberation Army's station to express their condolences and present flags.

　　我军进至温州　岸上鞭炮齐鸣
  　浙南人民热烈欢迎解放军
    【新华社杭州九日电】进抵浙江南部温州的人民解放军，受到当地人民的热烈欢迎。还在人民解放军渡江南征以前，浙南各县人民便与当地人民游击队及游击根据地的民主政府一起，在“迎接人民解放军南下”的口号下，筹集了大批粮草、军鞋和菜蔬。乐清县人民在几天内缴出的米、柴即达数十万斤。被国民党匪帮杀害的农民仇小坤的妻子，虽然家境困难，仍向亲友借了二斗麦子支援大军，并做了五双军鞋送给替她报仇的人民解放军。广大农村中的劳动妇女，在民主妇联提出“一双鞋运动”以后，每人都做了三五双鞋劳军。瑞安县许多劳动妇女在军鞋上绣着“我们翻了身，是你们（指人民解放军）给我们的”、“你是我们的救星”等字样。平阳县劳动妇女还特别精工制了大批“慰劳袋”，里面装着香烟、火柴和肥皂等慰劳品。当人民解放军进入浙南地区时，人民象与亲人久别重逢一样到处奔走慰问解放军。当人民解放军的先头部队乘船进至温州附近时，岸上鞭炮齐鸣，人民热切地招呼部队上岸。丽水县腾桥口和平阳、瑞安等县各界人民团体代表，远道赶到人民解放军驻地进行慰问和献旗。
