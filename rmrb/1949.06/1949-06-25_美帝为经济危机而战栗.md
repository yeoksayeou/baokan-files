　　U.S. Imperialism Trembles Before Economic Crisis

　　"The terrifying specter of a new economic crisis is already standing on the threshold of capitalist countries." This is most evident in the United States and Britain, where Wall Street bosses are trembling before this specter. Large and small businesses are clamoring for reductions in military spending and expenditures. How weak and insignificant does Anglo-American imperialism appear in the face of the increasingly powerful, prosperous, and happy democratic world! The capitalist system is heading towards its grave; it is a society nearing its end. This also tells us that the democratic world is growing stronger, anti-people imperialism is heading towards its demise, and the people of the world are steadfastly fighting for democracy and peace. Victory will surely belong to the people!

    美帝为经济危机而战栗
    “新经济危机吓人的幽灵，已站在资本主义国家的门槛上了”，表现得最明显的是美国和英国，华尔街的老板们面对着这个幽灵正战栗不止，大小企业界都纷纷要求削减军费和开支。美英帝国主义在日益强大繁荣幸福的民主世界面前显得是多么的衰弱渺小！资本主义制度正走向它的坟墓，它是一个即将告终的社会。这也同时告诉我们，民主世界正走向壮大，反人民的帝国主义正走向死亡，而全世界人民都在坚定的为着民主和平而战斗，胜利是一定属于人民的！
