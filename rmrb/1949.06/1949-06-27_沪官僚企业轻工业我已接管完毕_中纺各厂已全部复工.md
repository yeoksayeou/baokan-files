Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 26th. The Light Industry Department of the Shanghai Military Control Commission has completed the takeover of light industry and related units in Shanghai's Kuomintang bureaucratic capital enterprises. Since May 30th, initial statistics show that the units taken over include the China Textile Corporation (with 35 factories under it), the China Textile Machinery Manufacturing Company, the Jingwei Textile Machinery Factory, the China Tobacco Company, the Central Industrial Experiment Institute, the China Oils and Fats Industrial Company, the Central Pharmaceutical Factory, the DeFu Foreign Firm, the Qingdao Brewery Shanghai Office, the Shanghai Office of the Japanese Reparations Committee of the Puppet Ministry of Economic Affairs, and the China Cotton Production and Processing Plant, totaling 15 units. These include 52 factories, 11 warehouses, and 17 business organizations, employing over 5,800 staff members and over 60,000 workers. The main machinery and power equipment received include over 910,000 cotton spindles, over 31,000 woolen spindles, 17,535 cotton looms, 817 woolen looms and linen looms, 603 knitting machines and garment machines, 272 refining pots and dyeing vats for printing and dyeing, 1,152 machine tools such as lathes, 4 generators, and hundreds of cigarette-making machines, leather-making machines, and pharmaceutical machines. All the taken-over enterprises, thanks to the heroic protection of the staff and workers during the Shanghai liberation battles, have largely intact machinery and materials. As of May 30th, all 35 units of the China Textile Corporation had resumed work. Among them, the First Cotton Mill never stopped production, while the Seventh Cotton Mill, the First Woolen Mill, the First Linen Mill, and most of the factories in East Shanghai resumed work on the second day after the local liberation. By mid-June, the spinning rate of the company's spindles had reached 84% of the spinning rate in April before liberation. In addition, the No. 1 and No. 2 factories of the China Tobacco Company, the China Oils and Fats Industrial Company, and the three factories of the China Textile Machinery Manufacturing Company have also resumed work one after another. Those that have not yet resumed work are also striving to resume production.
