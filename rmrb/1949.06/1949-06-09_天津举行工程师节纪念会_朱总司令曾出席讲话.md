Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, 8th: The first Engineer's Day commemoration since Tianjin's liberation was held at Ning Garden on the afternoon of the 6th. Over 1,200 people attended, including engineers from Tianjin and guests. Commander-in-Chief Zhu De, Commander of the North China Military Region General Nie Rongzhen, and Mayor Huang Jing attended.

	In his speech, Commander-in-Chief Zhu De pointed out: China has abundant resources, and its people are diligent and intelligent. North China and Northeast China have a relatively good industrial base, especially a heavy industrial base. There are also some knowledgeable and experienced engineers, technicians, and skilled workers. These are all excellent existing conditions for us to engage in construction. He said: In order to undertake the glorious task of building a new China, all engineers need to: First, strengthen unity, avoid factionalism, avoid jealousy, and avoid arrogance. They must contribute all their technology to the people's own country and serve the people wholeheartedly. Second, cooperate with workers, give full play to the workers' strength and talent, and do a good job in construction. Third, unite with management staff, help each other, and work together to complete the plan.

	General Nie Rongzhen said in his speech that he hoped engineers could apply the theories they learned at home or abroad well to China's specific environment and rely on the initiative and creativity of workers to carry out production and construction.

	The conference adopted the organization of the Tianjin Engineers Association and determined the basic tasks of the association at this stage as: 1. Unite engineers, strengthen political awareness, and actively serve the economic construction of the New Democracy. 2. Exchange experience and knowledge in engineering technology and engineering management. 3. Research engineering and standard issues, and provide reference for the government, factories, and schools to adopt. 4. Assist the government, factories, and schools in cultivating engineering talents. 5. Investigate, register, and introduce various engineering talents to meet the needs of various construction undertakings. 6. Connect with scientific organizations to combine scientific theory with engineering practice.

	Finally, the conference elected 15 preparatory committee members for the Engineers Association.
