　　Taiyuan Trading Company Low-Price Rationing of Grain Ensures Workers' Livelihood
    [Taiyuan Electric] To ensure that workers' wages are not affected by price fluctuations, the Taiyuan Military Control Commission ordered the Taiyuan Trading Company to ration millet to employees at a price 27.5 percent lower than the market price on the 17th of last month. Oil and salt were also rationed at appropriately low prices. After the rationing began, factories flocked to purchase them. Up to the 19th, according to incomplete statistics, 248,710 jin of millet, 6,212 jin of white flour, 276 jin of wheat, 4,419 jin of salt, and 1,142 jin of oil had been sold. The Taiyuan Military Control Commission issued temporary measures for the May salaries of public factories, schools, post and telecommunications, transportation, and other departments on the 21st of last month. Before entering the city, it had been determined that the employees of various enterprises would basically adopt the original salary system, but under Yan Xishan's so-called "civilian economy" policy and "battle city" measures, the actual wages of most employees had fallen to the point where they could not maintain their livelihoods, so adjustments were made to formulate the current temporary measures. The determination of this salary, except for the postal and telecommunications departments, which used the average salary of January, February, and March before liberation as the standard, the wages of other departments were generally increased compared to before liberation. When paying wages, in order to ensure the "actual wages" of workers and civil servants and avoid speculation and price fluctuations by unscrupulous merchants, the Military Control Commission has notified the Trading Company and the General Cooperative to prepare a large number of goods so that they can buy enough grain and goods at the assessed rice price.
