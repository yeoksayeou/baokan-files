Many Small and Medium Cities in North China Correct Neglect of Worker's Work
　　Handan and Other Places Determined to Strengthen Trade Union Leadership

　　[This newspaper reported] After studying the news of the Second Plenary Session of the CPC Central Committee and other documents pointing out the policy of relying on the proletariat and uniting other classes to restore and develop production, cadres in small and medium cities in North China such as Handan, Xingtai, Linqing, Cangzhou, Fenyang, Yuci, Hunyuan, and Yanggao have successively examined the tendency to neglect worker's work. During the examination, various places discovered that many cadres had mistakenly believed that there were no large industries and industrial workers in small and medium-sized towns, and that the strength of workers could not be seen in these places. For example, cadres in Xingtai and other places, based on this kind of wrong understanding, had abandoned the work of various industries and concentrated on organizing the production of the poor. Some cadres also vaguely believed that factory owners profiting and merchants making money meant prosperity in production, and that developing production did not require relying on workers but only relying on capitalists and merchants to operate. In addition, some cadres lacked a class-based understanding of workers, believing that workers were "not simple," and lacked class enthusiasm for workers. As a result, worker's work in many small and medium-sized towns has been very poor for a long time since liberation. For example, in Cangzhou City, Hebei Province, there are more than 600 workers in various industries, and trade union work has completely fallen into a state of laissez-faire. Workers are unfamiliar with the trade union because no meetings have been held from "May 1st" last year to April this year. Of the more than 5,800 workers in five counties including Hunyuan and Guangling in the Yanbei District of Chahar Province, only 1,200 had been absorbed into trade unions by the end of April this year. None of the seven district committees in Yanggao's urban area were doing worker's work, and none of the 87 party members developed were workers. The trade union established in March this year was also a formality. In mid-March, Shanxi Province inspected the workers' work in nearly ten small and medium-sized towns such as Fenyang and Taigu. No workers' meetings had been held in these places for more than half a year since liberation. Workers' representatives in Qi County requested to organize a trade union, but the county government refused on the grounds of a lack of cadres. At the same time, the legitimate rights of workers in many places were not guaranteed, and they continued to endure various excessive exploitation and oppression from the capitalists. After further clarifying the important role of the working class in developing production, cadres in various places have begun to correct the above-mentioned deviations. The Chahar Daily published an editorial entitled "Strengthening Workers' Work in Small and Medium-Sized Towns," pointing out the important role of factories, workshops, and various handicraft workers in small and medium-sized towns in manufacturing agricultural tools, supplying farmers with means of production, and supporting rural economic development, and provided specific suggestions for labor movement work. The Linqing Municipal Committee of the CPC regards cultivating and absorbing worker activists into the Party as the central task of Party building at present. The Handan Municipal Committee of the CPC has selected capable cadres to be responsible for leading trade union work, and new developments have been made in employee education. Employee night schools have been opened in larger enterprises, and the secretary of the municipal party committee also lectures at the night school. Other places have formulated specific steps for establishing and improving trade union organizations, and have begun to pay attention to issues such as wages, working hours, and apprentice treatment.

### 华北许多中小城市纠正忽视工人工作　邯郸等地决加强工会领导

　　华北许多中小城市纠正忽视工人工作
  　邯郸等地决加强工会领导
    【本报讯】华北中小城市邯郸、邢台、临清、沧州、汾阳、榆次、浑源、阳高等地干部，在学习中共中央二中全会新闻及其他文件中所指出的依靠无产阶级、团结其他阶层恢复与发展生产的政策后，先后检查了忽视工人工作的偏向。各地在检查中发现，不少干部曾错误地认为中小城镇没有大工业和产业工人，在这些地方看不见工人的力量，如象邢台等地干部基于此种错误认识，曾抛开各业工人工作而专心于组织贫民生产。还有些干部，只是模糊地认为厂主获利商人赚钱就是生产繁荣，以为发展生产不要依靠工人而只是依靠资本家和商人去经营就够了。此外，有些干部对工人缺乏合乎阶级观点的了解，认为工人“不朴素”，对工人缺乏阶级热情。因而，不少中小城镇解放已久，工人工作进行甚差。如河北省沧州市内有各业工人六百余，工会工作完全陷于自流状态，工人对工会是陌生的，因为自去年“五一”至今年四月未开过一次会。察哈尔省雁北区浑源、广灵等五县五千八百余工人中今年四月底以前被吸收参加工会的仅一千二百人。阳高城关区的七个区委中没有一个作工人工作，所发展的八十七个党员中没有一个工人。今年三月所成立的职工会也是形式的。山西省在三月中检查了汾阳、太谷等近十个中小城镇的职工工作，这些地方解放半年多以来未开过一次工人会，祁县工人代表要求组织工会，县政府却以干部缺乏予以拒绝。与此同时，不少地方工人的正当权利毫无保障，依然忍受着资方种种过度的剥削压制。对上述偏向，各地干部在进一步明确了工人阶级对发展生产的重要作用之后，已开始进行纠正。察哈尔日报曾以“加强中小城镇工人工作”为题发出社论，指出中小城镇的工厂、作坊及各种手工业工人在制造农具、供给农民生产资料、扶助农村经济发展中的重要作用，并对工运工作提供了具体意见。临清市中共市委把培养、吸收工人积极分子入党，作为目前建党的中心任务；邯郸市中共市委选派了得力干部负责领导工会工作，对职工教育已有新的开展，较大的企业中均已开办了职工夜校，市委书记并在夜校担任授课。其他各地对建立与健全工会组织已订出具体步骤，对工资、工时及学徒待遇等问题，也已开始予以注意。
