　　Preparatory Committee of Ping City National Medicine Trade Union Established
    [Report from this newspaper] The Ping City Federation of Trade Unions convened a meeting of representatives of workers from the national medicine trade yesterday to discuss resolving labor-capital disputes and organizing a preparatory committee for the trade union. Two hundred and fifty representatives attended the meeting. Comrades Liu Zihjiu from the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, and Xiao Ming and Zhang Chunjiu from the City Federation of Trade Unions all spoke at the meeting, explaining the current policies and calling on workers to work hard under the principle of benefiting both labor and capital to develop production. On the one hand, they should expose any excessive and unreasonable exploitation by the capitalists, and on the other hand, they should also correct the excessively high wage demands of a few workers. Workers from various factories responded enthusiastically and decided on the spot that in the future, to resolve labor-capital disputes, they would no longer adopt the method of each factory solving its own problems separately, but would uniformly hand them over to the trade union preparatory committee for unified resolution, in order to seek correctness and consistency. At the same time, each factory elected worker representatives Wang Zhaochang, Zhao Junjie, and 31 others by district as members of the preparatory committee. The preparatory committee of the National Medicine Trade Union was declared formally established on the spot. (Ming)

　　平市国药行职工筹委会成立
    【本报讯】平市职工总会昨召集国药行职工代表会议，讨论解决劳资纠纷及组织职工筹委会问题。出席代表二百五十人。全国总工会刘子久、市职工总会萧明、张春久等同志均在会上发言，解释当前政策，号召工友在劳资两利发展生产的原则下努力工作。一面要揭发任何资方过分的不合理的剥削，一面也要纠正少数工友过高工资的要求。各厂工友均热烈响应，并当场决议：今后解决劳资纠纷，不再采取分别的各厂解决各厂问题的方式，而一律交由该行职工筹委会统一解决，以求正确和一致。同时，各厂按区选出职工代表王兆昌、赵俊杰等三十三人为筹委，国药行职工筹委会当场宣布正式成立。（鸣）
