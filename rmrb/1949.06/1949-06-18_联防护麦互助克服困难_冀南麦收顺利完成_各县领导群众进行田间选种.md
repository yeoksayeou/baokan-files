　　Joint Defense and Mutual Aid to Overcome Difficulties
  　Southern Hebei Wheat Harvest Successfully Completed
    Leaders and Masses in Various Counties Conduct Field Seed Selection
    [Jinan Telegraph] Farmers in Southern Hebei launched a concentrated effort to harvest and thresh wheat, successfully completing the region's wheat harvest. After receiving instructions from the Administrative Office on harvesting and protecting wheat, the various Special Commissioner's Offices and county governments quickly made arrangements at each level. Starting from May 25th, various localities successively entered the wheat harvest upsurge. Militiamen and self-defense team members patrolled in shifts or guarded in sections, organizing joint defense and wheat protection, ensuring excellent order during the wheat harvest. For example, in Guozhuang, District One, Wei County, militiamen patrolled at night, and male and female farmers guarded during the day, ensuring all wheat was brought in. In isolated villages, such as Liu Nuguan Village in Guangping, arson was attempted by bad elements, but it was immediately extinguished. Due to the larger planting area compared to previous years, coupled with the need to combine replanting, weeding, and pest control, a shortage of manpower and animal power became a common difficulty in various localities. Governments and Party committees at all levels strengthened leadership, organized various forms of mutual aid teams, starting work before dawn and finishing late at night. Whoever's wheat ripened first was harvested first, threshing and storing followed the harvest. A large number of women participated in cutting and pulling wheat, and threshing, competing with men in labor, which helped to solve the problem of labor shortages. The wheat of revolutionary martyrs' families, military dependents, workers' families, and households without labor was also brought into storage at the same time. Various organizations also drew out a large amount of manpower and animal power to assist with the harvest. The Administrative Office and transportation teams dispatched thirty-five large carts, and the Finance School helped harvest two hundred and ten mu. By June 10th, the wheat harvest in the entire region had essentially concluded. Out of the 30,457,627 mu of land in the entire region, 13,594,495 mu were planted with wheat, including 1,200,000 mu of paddy fields and over 12,094,000 mu of dry land. The wheat planting area accounted for 44.4 percent of the cultivated land.
    This year, due to the spring drought, the harvest was not as good as in previous years, but generally satisfactory. The three Special Commissioner's Offices of Handan, Nangong, and Xiajin were better, while Linqing and Hengshui Special Commissioner's Offices were worse. Paddy fields yielded approximately 150 jin per mu, and dry land yielded approximately 70 jin per mu, with an average yield of approximately 70.8 jin per mu, totaling approximately 96,158,000 jin of wheat. In Beiguan and other six villages in Wei County, the best wheat land yielded 160 jin per mu, generally 128 jin, and the worst 96 jin, averaging 128 jin. The best stubble wheat yielded 96 jin per mu, generally 80 jin, and the worst 48 jin, averaging 75 jin. During the wheat harvest, seed selection was carried out in various localities. The Administrative Office sent seed selection work teams to Guangzong, Linqing, and other counties to provide guidance and assistance. In addition to mobilizing the masses of farmers to widely carry out seed selection, cadres in various counties also mobilized the masses to exchange or purchase at market prices. The Linqing Special Commissioner's Office acquired 60,000 jin of the "Fish Scale White" superior wheat variety during the wheat harvest, and Guangzong County acquired more than 20,000 jin of "Guangzong Wheat." Now that the new wheat has been stored, farmers in various localities are extremely happy, and are enthusiastically practicing thrift based on the spirit of "save on the bottom of the granary, not the top," and are sun-drying and selecting good wheat in preparation for the early delivery of public grain during the wheat season.

　　联防护麦互助克服困难
  　冀南麦收顺利完成
    各县领导群众进行田间选种
    【冀南电】冀南农民突击割打，全区麦收顺利完成。各专署县政府于收到行署收麦护麦指示后，迅速逐级作了布置，自五月二十五日开始，各地即先后投入麦收热潮。民兵、自卫队员分班分组轮流巡逻或分片看守，组织联防护麦，使麦收秩序极为良好。如威县一区郭庄，夜间民兵巡逻，白天男女农民看守，所有麦子全部收回。个别村庄如广平刘女固村，遭坏分子放火烧场，但立即扑灭。由于种麦面积较往年为大，又须结合补苗、锄苗、捕虫，人畜力缺乏成为各地普遍的困难。各级政府、党委加强领导，组织了各式各样的互助组，起五更、睡半夜，谁的先熟先割谁的，随收随打随入仓，广大妇女参加割麦拔麦打场，与男子竞赛劳动，使缺乏劳力困难得以解决。如烈、军、工属及无劳力户的麦子，也作到同时入仓。各机关均抽出大批人力畜力助收，行署和运输队就抽出大车三十五辆，财校助收二百一十亩。至六月十日，全区麦收已告结束。全区土地三零四五七六二七亩中，种麦一三五九四四九五亩，内水田一百二十万亩，旱地一千二百零九万四千余亩。种麦面积占耕地百分之四十四点四。
    今年因春旱，收成不如往年，但大体不错，以邯郸、南宫、夏津三个专区较好，临清、衡水专区较差。水田每亩约产一百五十斤，旱田每亩约为七十斤左右计，每亩平均约产七十点八斤，共可产麦约九万六千一百五十八万余斤。威县北关等六个村，留麦地每亩产量最好者一百六十斤，一般一百二十八斤，最次者九十六斤，平均一百二十八斤。茬麦最好者每亩产量九十六斤，一般八十斤，最差者四十八斤，平均七十五斤。麦收期间，各地进行了选种，行署曾派选种工作组赴广宗、临清等县领导帮助，各县干部除动员农民群众广泛进行选种外，并发动群众交换或以市价购买。临清专区在麦收中收购“鱼鳞白”优良麦种六万斤，广宗县收购“广宗小麦”二万多斤。现新麦入仓，各地农民皆极欢欣，正纷纷本“省囤尖不省囤底”的精神，厉行节约，并晒选好麦子准备早交麦季公粮。
