　　In Memory of Comrade Qu Qiubai
    Wu Yuzhang

    Comrade Qu Qiubai struggled arduously and unyieldingly for the revolution. Today marks the 14th anniversary of his heroic sacrifice and calm acceptance of death.

    The first and most profound impression Comrade Qiubai left on me was his struggle against opportunism. In May 1927, during our Party's Fifth National Congress, Comrade Qiubai wrote a booklet opposing Chen Duxiu and Peng Shuzhi's opportunism. Everyone at the Party Congress agreed that Comrade Qiubai's criticism was correct, but no serious decision was made. Instead, a conciliatory attitude was adopted, and the Party leadership was not changed, with Chen Duxiu remaining as the Party's General Secretary. This opportunistic and capitulationist leadership ultimately led to the failure of the Great Revolution. This painful lesson made our Party deeply realize that "a working-class party cannot preserve the unity and discipline of its ranks and cannot fulfill its mission as the organizer and leader of the proletarian revolution if it does not wage an irreconcilable struggle against opportunism in its own ranks and smash the capitulationists in its own ranks." Since then, the history of the development of our Party's internal life has been a history of resolutely fighting against and crushing "left" and right-leaning opportunism within the Party, thus enabling our Party to become Bolshevik, to become increasingly consolidated and sound, and to be able to shoulder the great revolutionary mission of China.

    The second most profound impression Comrade Qiubai left on me was the creation of the new Chinese script. He advocated that the reform of Chinese characters must be a character revolution, that a phonetic system should be adopted, and that a new Chinese script should be created using Roman (Latin) letters to achieve the goal of "unity of speech and writing." In the 1928 era, he often discussed the issue of Chinese character reform with me and Comrades Lin Boqu and others. He wrote the booklet "Chinese Latinization Alphabet." In September 1931, Chinese workers convened the First Congress of New Chinese Characters in Vladivostok, and based on his booklet, they created a new plan for the new Chinese characters, which gave the reform of Chinese characters a correct direction, was welcomed by the broad masses of people, and opened up the road for the development of new Chinese characters.

    The third most profound impression Comrade Qiubai left on me was the advocacy of popularization of literature and art. In the 1932 era, he wrote many articles criticizing the May Fourth-style new classical Chinese and the capitalist and old-fashioned "Europeanized literature and art." He advocated that "the proletariat should begin a systematic struggle to open up the path of popularization of literature and art." He believed that "the people's own revolutionary literary and artistic line is to create revolutionary mass literature and art, and to popularize revolutionary 'Europeanized literature and art.' At present, most of the revolutionary mass literature and art still needs to use the forms of old-style mass literature and art (storytelling, novels, ditties, stories, etc.) to express revolutionary content and class consciousness. This initial revolutionary mass literature and art will gradually raise the artistic level along with the masses. And the Chinese people, especially the vanguard of the Chinese workers, should also use the experience of the world proletariat and the achievements of world culture. Only in this sense can we talk about so-called 'Europeanization' for revolutionary literature and art." Therefore, he introduced many works by Gorky and other Soviet writers to China. He had the closest relationship with Lu Xun. They respected each other, and his thoughts and words deeply moved Lu Xun. They fought side by side, making the Kuomintang's reactionary cultural "encirclement and suppression" as defeated as the military encirclement and suppression.

    Today, as the People's Liberation Army achieves great victories and the whole country is about to be completely liberated, commemorating Comrade Qiubai can, on the one hand, comfort the martyrs that the revolution is about to achieve victory nationwide; on the other hand, it increases our responsibility. Our comrades have done a very good job in military and political work under the leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao, and have achieved unprecedented brilliant victories. The economic construction work and cultural construction work that are now before us urgently require us to work harder to undertake and complete the construction of the new democratic economy and culture. We must also, like military and political affairs, complete our tasks well under the wise leadership of our Party and Chairman Mao.

　　纪念瞿秋白同志
    吴玉章
    瞿秋白同志为革命艰苦奋斗，不屈不挠。今天是他英勇牺牲从容就义的十四周年纪念日。
    秋白同志第一个使我印象最深的是他反机会主义的斗争。一九二七年五月，我们党第五次全国代表大会时，秋白同志写了反对陈独秀、彭述之机会主义的一本小册子，党大会上大家都认为秋白同志的批评是正确的，但没有作出严肃的决定，反而采取了调和态度，没有把党的领导更换，还是使陈独秀仍旧担任党的总书记。这个机会主义、投降主义的领导，终于把大革命弄失败了，这一惨痛的教训，才使我们党深刻地了解到“工人阶级政党不与自己队伍中的机会主义作不调和的斗争，不把自己队伍中的投降主义者粉碎，就不能保存自己队伍底统一和纪律，就不能实现其为无产阶级革命底组织者和领导者的使命。”从此以后，我们党内部生活发展的历史，是坚决与党内“左”右倾机会主义作不调和的斗争，并把他们粉碎的历史，因而使我们党能够布尔什维克化，能够日益巩固健全起来，能够担负中国伟大的革命使命。
    秋白同志第二个使我印象最深的是中国新文字的创造，他主张中国文字改革必须是文字革命，应当采取拼音制度，用罗马（拉丁）字母拼音，制造一种新的中国文字，方才能够达到“言文一致”的目的。一九二八年时代，他常和我及林伯渠同志等几个人研究中国文字改革问题，他写成了“中国拉丁化字母”的小册子，一九三一年九月中国工人在海参岁召集了中国新文字第一次代表大会，根据他的小册子作出了中国新文字的新方案，这就使中国文字改革有了一个正确的方向，受到广大人民的欢迎，开辟了中国新文字发展的道路。
    秋白同志第三个使我印象最深的是文艺大众化的提倡。一九三二年时代，他写了许多文章批评五四式的新文言，和资本主义式的、旧式的“欧化文艺”。而主张“无产阶级应当开始有系统的斗争，去开辟文艺大众化的道路。”他以为“民众自己的文艺革命的路线是要创造革命的大众文艺，是要使革命的‘欧化文艺’大众化。现在，革命的大众文艺大半还要运用旧式的大众文艺的形式（说书，演义，小唱，故事等等），而表现革命的内容，表现阶级的意识。这种初期的革命的大众文艺，将要同着大众一起，渐渐的提高艺术水平线。而中国的民众，尤其是中国工人的先锋队，同时也应当运用世界无产阶级的经验，运用世界文化的成绩：对于革命文艺，只有在这个意义上，方才说得上所谓‘欧化’。“因此，他介绍了许多高尔基及其他苏联文学家的作品到中国，他和鲁迅交往最亲密，他们彼此互相尊重，他的思想言行使鲁迅深为感动，他们并肩作战，使国民党反动的文化“围剿”也同军事围剿一样，一败涂地。
    在人民解放军伟大胜利，全国即将得到完全解放的今天来纪念秋白同志，一方面可以告慰先烈，革命即将在全国范围内获得胜利；一方面更加重我们的责任。我们同志在党和毛主席领导之下的军事工作、政治工作都是作得很好的，得到了史无前例的辉煌胜利。现在摆在我们面前的经济建设工作，文化建设工作，是迫切需要我们更努力地担负起来，完成新民主主义的经济和文化的建设，我们也要和军事政治一样，在我们党和毛主席英明领导之下，很好的完成我们的任务。
