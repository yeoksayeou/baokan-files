    The mass movement of the whole world to defend peace and oppose war is continuing to develop. Here, it is worth noting that the British people's movement to demand friendship with the Soviet Union and defend peace has recently made very important progress. Birmingham held a conference on the 11th, representing 150,000 British workers and housewives, and passed a declaration to fight for Soviet-Union friendship and peace. London held a conference on the 12th, representing 2.1 million British people, for Soviet peace, trade, and friendship. The conference unanimously passed a declaration demanding that the British government must adopt a friendly policy towards the Soviet Union, and this policy should first be manifested in the expansion of trade between the two countries, which is extremely important for improving the living standards of the British people. More importantly, the British Peace Committee was established in London on the 15th. The committee is planning a nationwide peace movement in Britain and has decided to hold a series of conferences and demonstrations in major cities in the coming weeks, and a grand peace conference will be held in London in October. In Latin America in the Western Hemisphere, despite the police terror in most places, the peace and democracy movement led by the Communist Party and other progressive forces is growing stronger. One of the main forces supporting the peace movement and the national liberation movement is the Latin American Labor Federation, which has more than 5 million members. The Latin American Peace Conference will be held in Mexico City on August 1st. In the United States, senior officials of progressive trade unions have issued calls condemning the aggressive North Atlantic Treaty. Local unions of the CIO, the AFL, and independent unions have united in various regions to urge the U.S. government to end the Cold War policy and restore the policy of cooperation with the Soviet Union. In Hungary, the National Congress for the Defense of Peace opened on the 17th.

    全世界保卫和平运动继续发展（续昨）
    全世界保卫和平、反对战争的群众运动在继续发展中。在这里，值得注意的是，英国人民要求对苏友好与保卫和平的运动，最近有了很重要的进展。伯明翰于十一日举行了代表英国十五万工人与家庭主妇的大会，通过了为对苏友谊与和平而奋斗的宣言。伦敦于十二日举行了代表英国二百一十万人民的对苏和平、贸易与友好大会。大会一致地通过宣言，要求英国政府必须对苏联采取友好的政策，而这种政策首先应当表现在对于提高英国人民生活水准极为重要的两国间贸易的扩大上面。更重要的，是英国和平委员会已于十五日在伦敦成立。委员会正在筹划英国全国规模的和平运动，决定在未来数周中，将在各大城市举行一系列的大会与示威，并将于十月在伦敦举行盛大的和平代表大会。在西半球的拉丁美洲，尽管大部分地方都有警察的恐怖，但是，共产党与其他进步力量所领导的和平民主运动正在日益加强。支持和平运动与民族解放运动的主要力量之一，是拥有五百余万会员的拉丁美洲劳工联合会。拉丁美洲保卫和平大会，将于八月一日在墨西哥城举行。在美国，进步工会的高级人员，已发出了斥责侵略性的北大西洋公约的呼声。美国产联，劳联和独立工会的地方工会，已在各个地区联合一致，敦促美国政府结束冷战政策与恢复对苏合作政策。在匈牙利，全国拥护和平大会已于十七日开幕。
