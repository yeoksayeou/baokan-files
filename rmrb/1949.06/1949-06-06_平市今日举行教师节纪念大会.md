　　Peiping City Holds Teachers' Day Commemoration Meeting Today
　　[This Newspaper's News] The Peiping City Primary and Secondary School Teachers' Union Preparatory Committee is organizing a commemoration meeting for the June 6th Teachers' Day. It will be held this morning (6th) at 9:00 AM at the National Theater, with speeches from party and government leaders and teacher representatives. A commemorative evening party will be held at the Zhongshan Park Music Hall starting at 6:00 PM, featuring performances of "Soldiers and Civilians" and "Red Warriors" by the North China Military Region Anti-Enemy Drama Society and the Primary and Secondary School Music Education Association Choir. (Teachers' Union Preparatory Committee)
　　Note: China's Teachers' Day began on June 6th of the 20th year of the Republic of China (1931). At that time, under the dark rule of the Kuomintang reactionaries, schools across the country were frequently in arrears with salaries, and teachers' lives were very difficult. In addition, the Kuomintang's dark education authorities did not value talent and appointed their own private individuals, leaving the teaching profession without any security. To change this situation, educational circles in Nanjing and Shanghai initiated a call for a national conference of education workers in May of the 20th year of the Republic of China. On June 6th of the same year, the first meeting was held in Nanjing, attended by more than 300 people from educational circles in the Nanjing and Shanghai area. The meeting passed and issued a declaration, calling for improved teacher treatment, guaranteed teacher employment, increased social status, and increased opportunities for teachers to study and improve themselves, and decided that this day (June 6th) would be Teachers' Day. A commemoration is held every year on "June 6th".

　　平市今日举行教师节纪念大会
    【本报讯】平市中小学教联筹委会筹办的纪念六六教师节纪念大会，今（六）日上午九时在国民戏院举行，有党政首长及教师代表讲演。下午六时起在中山公园音乐堂举行纪念晚会，由华北军区抗敌剧社与中小音教会歌咏团分别演唱“子弟兵与老百姓”、“红色的战士”等节目。（教联筹委会）
    按：我国的教师节，是从民国二十年六月六日开始的。当时在国民党反动派黑暗统治下，国内各学校经常欠薪，教师的生活很苦。加之国民党黑暗的教育当局不看材能，各自任用私人，教师职业毫无保障。为改变此种情况，宁沪教育界人士在民国二十年五月发起召集全国教育工作者大会，同年六月六日，在南京召开第一次会议，到会者有京沪一带教育界三百多人。会议通过发表宣言，为改善教师待遇，保障教师职业，提高社会地位，增加教师进修学习条件而呼吁，并决定当日（六月六日）为教师节。每年“六、六”举行纪念。
