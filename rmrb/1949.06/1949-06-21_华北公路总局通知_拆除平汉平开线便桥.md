[This newspaper report] The North China Highway General Bureau has issued a notice regarding the removal of temporary bridges originally erected on the Pinghan and Pingkai lines, urging all passing public and private vehicles to take note and comply. The notice states: With the rainy season approaching in North China and mountain floods imminent, in order to avoid the unnecessary loss of materials caused by the destruction of temporary bridges on the various main lines under our jurisdiction by floods, we will begin dismantling them on June 17th and will rebuild them after the rainy season has passed. The list of bridges to be dismantled is as follows: 1. Pinghan Line—Hongxian Qi River Bridge, Cixian Zhang River Bridge, Zhengding County Hutuo River Bridge, Xinle County Sha River Bridge, Dingxian Tang River Bridge, Dingxing County Bei River Bridge; 2. Pingkai Line—Guan Yongding River Bridge.

The dismantling of all the above bridges will be completed by the end of June. In order to maintain traffic after the bridges are removed, the North China General Bureau has dispatched personnel to assist local governments in strengthening the organization based on the existing ferry crossings and establishing ferry crossing committees; and has formulated ferry crossing regulations in accordance with the government's call for road users to maintain the roads.
