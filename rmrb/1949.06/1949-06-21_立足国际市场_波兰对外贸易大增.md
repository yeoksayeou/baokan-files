Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, June 20th: The Polish Workers' News Agency commented on the prospects of Poland's foreign trade in an article entitled "Polish Goods Gain a Foothold in the International Market," stating that foreign trade is expected to increase by 25 percent this year. Before the war, Poland's foreign trade volume accounted for only 1 percent of the total world trade. Due to the changes in world economic relations after the war, and due to Poland's reconstruction work on new principles of the national economy, Poland's foreign trade has increased from $14 per person in 1938 to $40 per person in 1948. During the same period, the total annual import and export value has increased from $446 million to $1 billion. The continuous strengthening of cooperation with the Soviet Union and the People's Democratic countries is a major factor in expanding Poland's industry and commerce, and the expansion of industry and commerce is the potential for Poland's exports. In 1946, coal exports accounted for 62 percent of the total foreign trade, while this year coal exports will account for only 38 percent of the total foreign trade. The decrease in coal exports indicates that the exports of various other manufactured and semi-finished products are increasing in both quantity and quality. In the four years after the war, Poland has established trade relations with dozens of countries. The largest trading partners are the Soviet Union, Czechoslovakia, Sweden, and the United Kingdom. The signing of trade agreements with countries that do not belong to the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance proves that Poland's foreign trade policy follows the path of conducting trade with all countries, regardless of their political systems, as long as such trade is based on the principle of mutual benefit. The growth of Poland's foreign trade can be demonstrated by the many trade agreements that have been concluded. Existing agreements with Hungary, Bulgaria, Romania, and the Soviet-occupied zone of Germany have been expanded this year. Trade relations have been established with Palestine and India. Trade negotiations with Egypt, Israel, and Italy are underway. The prospects for trade relations with People's China and Iran are also in sight. The goal of Poland's foreign trade policy is to conclude long-term agreements that are closely integrated with Poland's planned economy. The Six-Year Plan has opened up new prospects for Poland's foreign trade, based on promoting economic cooperation with all countries, especially with the Soviet Union and the People's Democratic countries.

    波兰对外贸易大增
    波工人通讯社评论
    【新华社北平二十日电】波兰通讯社讯：此间工人通讯社以“波兰商品在国际市场上获得立足点”为题，评论波兰对外贸易的前途称：本年的对外贸易预计将增加百分之二十五。战前，波兰的对外贸易额仅为世界贸易总额的百分之一。由于战后世界经济关系的改变，由于波兰在国民经济的新原则上进行重建工作，波兰的对外贸易，已由一九三八年每人十四美元增加到一九四八年每人四十美元；在同一时期中，一年出入口总值已由四亿四千六百万美元增加到十亿美元。与苏联和人民民主国家的合作的不断加强，是大大地扩展波兰工商业的因素，而工商业的扩展，即是波兰出口的潜在力。一九四六年，煤的出口占对外贸易总数的百分之六十二，而本年煤的出口，将仅占对外贸易总数的百分之三十八。煤的出口之减低，表明了其他各种制成品与半制成品的出口不论在数量与质量方面都在增加。在战后四年当中，波兰已与几十个国家建立了贸易关系，最大的贸易对象是苏联、捷克斯洛伐克、瑞典和英国。与那些不属于经济互助委员会的国家签订贸易协定，证明波兰对外贸易的政策是遵循着与一切国家进行贸易的路线，不论这些国家的政治制度如何，只要这种贸易是基于互惠原则的。波兰对外贸易的增长，可以由已缔结的许多贸易协定来证明。原有与匈牙利、保加利亚、罗马尼亚、德境苏占区的协定，今年扩大了。业已与巴勒斯坦和印度建立了贸易关系。与埃及、以色列和意大利的贸易谈判正在进行中。与人民中国以及伊朗的贸易关系的前途也已在望。波兰对外贸易政策的目的，在于缔结与波兰计划经济密切结合的长期协定。六年计划为波兰以促进与一切国家首先是与苏联和人民民主国家的经济合作为基础的对外贸易，打开了新的前途。
