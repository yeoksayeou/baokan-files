　　The All-China Democratic Women's Federation Sends a Letter to Women in Newly Liberated Cities
    Calling for Active Participation in People's City Construction
    Learning from the Good Example of Sisters in Old Liberated Areas
    [Ping City News] The All-China Democratic Women's Federation published the following letter to women in Shanghai and other newly liberated cities on the 15th:
    Sisters in Shanghai, Nanjing, Taiyuan, Wuhan, Xi'an, Hangzhou, Qingdao, and all newly liberated cities:
    Under the victorious advance of the great People's Liberation Army, major cities like Shanghai now belong to the people, and you have all been liberated. We extend our warm congratulations to you and express our deepest concern to the sisters and their families who have been brutally murdered and ravaged by the Kuomintang bandit gang!
    In the past, under the atrocities of the Kuomintang reactionary bandit gang, your political consciousness has been raised through constant struggle and exercise, especially the 200,000 female workers and revolutionary intellectual women in Shanghai, who have a glorious revolutionary tradition. For the liberation of the people of the whole country and your own liberation, you have combined with the entire democratic movement for many years and carried out heroic and arduous struggles. Now that you are liberated, the sisters in Shanghai and other newly liberated cities have become the masters of the new society. I believe that in the future struggle to build new people's cities, you will inherit the revolutionary spirit of the past and play an active role.
    However, everyone should also know that there will be many difficulties on the road ahead. The first is the economic backwardness caused by the Kuomintang reactionary rule, coupled with the great destruction of the urban economy before the collapse, making it difficult for factories to resume work quickly. The remnant forces of the Kuomintang reactionary forces also organize special agent activities, preparing to destroy the people's cities in a hidden way. Therefore, we hope that you will take female workers as the foundation, unite other working women, intellectual women, self-employed women, and women from other classes, and closely unite with the people to respond to the call of the democratic government, overcome difficulties, restore production, develop production, heighten vigilance, prevent the sabotage activities of hidden enemies, and strive to quickly establish a new urban order. Female workers should strengthen unity, actively respond to the call for resumption of work and business, establish the concept of "labor is glorious" and a new labor attitude; learn to participate in factory management, and promote production enthusiasm and improve production efficiency based on the policy of taking into account both public and private interests and benefiting both labor and capital. Intellectual women should combine with productive labor, serve workers and peasants, and help unemployed female workers, family members of workers, and women who can work to engage in production; learn from the working people and transform themselves. Female employees in various enterprises, institutions, and military, political, cultural, and educational institutions should work steadily in their original positions, help the People's Liberation Army Military Control Commission complete the takeover tasks in a timely and rapid manner; give full play to their intelligence, study their business diligently, and become powerful cadres and talents in the people's cause. Female students should establish a new learning attitude, help schools establish learning order; strive to learn a new outlook on life, improve scientific and cultural knowledge, and cultivate themselves to become people's servants in the new society. In order to better undertake the above tasks, we hope that you will step up your organization, train a large number of women cadres, especially female worker cadres, and strive to achieve the complete liberation of women under the overall goal of building people's cities.
    Sisters, your tasks are great and arduous, but do not hesitate. The sisters in the old liberated areas have set a brilliant example for you: because they have actively participated in land reform, supported the front lines, production, work, and study under the leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao and under the protection of democratic politics, they have gradually gotten rid of the suffering given by the old society and greatly improved their social and family status; countless female labor heroes, female people's meritorious officials, female work models, learning models, and glorious female figures such as female county heads, female district heads, and female village heads have emerged among them. They used to be slaves of cattle and horses, but today they have become glorious masters in the new society, and they are the model of tens of millions of liberated women in China. This also proves that if you work as hard as they do, you will achieve the same brilliant results and be respected by the people.
    Sisters, let us join hands tightly, under the banner of Chairman Mao, and actively participate in the construction of the new China!

　　中华全国民主妇联致函新解放城市妇女
    号召积极参加人民城市建设
  　学习老解放区姊妹的好榜样
    【平市讯】中华全国民主妇女联合会于十五日发表致上海等新解放城市妇女的信如下：
    上海、南京、太原、武汉、西安、杭州、青岛的及各新解放城市的姐妹们：
    在伟大人民解放军胜利进军之下，上海等大都市也都属于人民所有了，你们都得到了解放。为此谨向你们致热烈的祝贺，同时并向遭到国民党匪帮残酷屠杀和摧残的姊妹们及其家属致最关切的慰问！
    过去你们在国民党反动匪帮的暴行下，在不断的斗争锻炼中，政治觉悟是提高了，特别是上海市的二十万女工和革命知识妇女更有光荣的革命传统。你们为全国人民的解放和自身的解放，多年来曾和整个民主运动相结合，进行了英勇艰苦的奋斗。现在解放以后，上海及其他新解放城市的姊妹们都已成为新社会的主人。相信你们在今后建设新人民城市的斗争中，一定会承继过去的革命精神，起积极的作用。
    不过大家还应该知道：在前进的道路上，还会遇到许多困难的。首先是国民党反动统治所造成的经济落后性，加上在溃败前对城市经济进行了巨大的破坏，使工厂不易迅速的复工；国民党反动势力残余并组织特务活动，准备以隐蔽的方法，来破坏人民的城市。所以希望你们以女工为基础，团结其他劳动妇女、知识妇女、自由职业妇女及其他阶层妇女，并紧紧和人民一起，响应民主政府号召，为克服困难，恢复生产，发展生产，提高警惕，防止暗藏敌人的破坏活动，迅速建立城市新秩序而努力。女工们应该加强团结，积极响应复工复业的号召，建立“劳动光荣”的观念和新的劳动态度；学习参加工厂管理，根据公私兼顾，劳资两利政策，发扬生产积极性，提高生产效能。知识妇女应该与生产劳动结合，为工农劳动妇女服务，帮助失业女工、工属和能劳动的妇女进行生产；向劳动人民学习，改造自己。各企业机构和军政文教各机关的女职员，更应安心在原职位工作，帮助人民解放军军管会，及时迅速完成接管任务；高度发挥智能，精研业务，成为人民事业中有力的干部人才。女学生应确立新的学习态度，帮助学校建立学习秩序；努力学习新的人生观，提高科学文化知识，培养自己成为新社会的人民勤务员。为了更好的担负以上的任务，希望你们加紧组织起来，大批培养妇女干部，尤其是女工干部，在建设人民的城市的总目标下，为实现妇女的彻底解放而努力。
    姊妹们，你们的任务是重大而又艰巨的，但不要有什么迟疑。老解放区的姊妹们，已为你们树立了光辉的榜样：由于她们在共产党毛主席领导下，在民主政治的保障下，积极参加了土地改革、支援前线、生产、工作和学习，已逐渐摆脱了旧社会给予的苦难，而大大提高了社会和家庭的地位；她们中涌现了无数女劳动英雄，女人民功臣、女工作模范，学习模范，和女县长、女区长、女村长、女代表等光荣的妇女人物。她们过去也是牛马奴隶，今天在新社会里变成了光荣的主人，她们是中国千万翻身妇女的典范。由此也可证明：你们如果象她们一样努力，也会得到同样的光辉成绩和人们的尊崇。
    姊妹们，我们紧紧携起手来，在毛主席的旗帜下，积极参加新中国建设吧！
