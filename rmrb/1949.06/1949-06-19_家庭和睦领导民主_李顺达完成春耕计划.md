　　【Taihang Telegram】Li Shunda, a first-class labor hero from Xigou Village, Pingshun, and his mother actively responded to the Party's call after attending the county's Party representative meeting in March. They formulated a year-long production plan for the entire family. Specific production plans were drawn up in stages according to the seasons and the different circumstances of each person. Because the family was harmonious and united, and leadership was democratic, everyone was able to give full play to their production enthusiasm. Therefore, each stage of the plan was completed on time. On the 22nd of last month, a family meeting was held to review and summarize the production achievements of this stage. In terms of agricultural production: The plan was to accumulate 300 loads of new fertilizer within two months, but in fact, 500 loads were accumulated; the plan was for each person to plant and keep alive two trees, and now the entire family of eight has planted 251 trees. The plans for valley fields, including plowing three times, harrowing three times, and raking twice; cornfields plowing twice, harrowing twice, and raking once; preparing enough firewood to last until the end of June (Gregorian calendar); and building up all 25 large and small embankments were also realized. The original plan was to apply 80 loads of fertilizer per mu of flat land, but actually 113 loads were applied; the plan for 10 mu of sloping land to apply 50 loads per mu was also slightly exceeded. In terms of improving cultivation techniques, all the land implemented crop rotation and seed changing, seed soaking, and seed selection. The family's sideline production also completed the plan. After checking and summarizing, the whole family continued to formulate a short-term production plan before weeding. Everyone is full of confidence and guarantees to complete the task.
