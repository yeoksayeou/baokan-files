Beiping Student Union
	Notice Regarding Student Union Work During Summer Vacation

	(1) During the summer vacation, student unions in all schools should, on a voluntary basis, extensively organize the majority of students remaining at school or whose homes are in the local area, based on their original departments, classes, grades, or societies, to conduct studies and various summer activities. They should immediately publicize and promote the reading of the All-China Student Federation's "Notice Regarding Summer Work for Students in Liberated Cities" and actively implement it.
	(2) In order to strengthen the leadership of the city-wide student summer activities, the Union has established a "Summer Student Work Committee" jointly with the Preparatory Committee of the New Democratic Youth League of Beiping, and has announced a plan. Student unions in all schools should publicize and organize students to read and discuss the plan, offer suggestions, and organize various activities in accordance with the needs and wishes of the majority of students. Students participating in the Youth Academy should still be organized according to the original student union system. Student unions in all schools are still the core of student organizations in each school during the summer vacation and should not abandon them or allow them to drift along. If the number of executive committee members or working students in the student union is insufficient due to students leaving the school, a large number of enthusiastic students should be mobilized to participate in the work, and the work should be distributed to more students to avoid wasting time and manpower due to re-elections. This will not only strengthen the work of the student union during the summer vacation, but also lay a good foundation for the work of the student union in the next semester.
	(3) The resolution of the first second session of the Union's Representative Assembly, "Overcoming Learning Obstacles and Taking Learning a Step Further," was adopted based on the preliminary summary of learning in various schools in the previous semester, and pointed out the path for carrying out learning in the next semester. We plan to widely publicize it in the "Youth Academy" and discuss it in light of the actual conditions of each school. If the representatives of each school have already conveyed and discussed it among the students, they should send the students' opinions and discussion summaries to us.

　　北平市学生联合会
  　关于暑假学生会工作的通知
    （一）暑假期间，各校学生会应在自愿基础上把留校或家在本地的广大同学，就原有系、班、级或社团等基础广泛地组织起来，进行学习及各种暑期活动。并应立即宣传并推动同学阅读全国学联“关于解放区各城市学生暑期工作的通知”，积极地去贯彻。
    （二）为了加强领导全市同学的暑期活动，本会已和新民主主义青年团北平市筹委会成立了“暑期学生工作委员会”，并公布了计划。各校学生会应宣传并组织同学阅读讨论，提出意见，并依照广大同学需要和愿望组织各种活动。参加青年学园的同学仍按原有学生会系统组织起来。各校学生会在暑假中仍是各校同学组织的核心，不应放弃不管，听任自流。由于同学离校而致学生会的执委或工作同学人数不足者，应发动大批热心服务的同学参加工作，把事情分给更多的同学来作，避免因改选而费去时间人力。这样，不但可以加强暑假期间学生会的工作，而且可以为下学期的学生会工作打下良好基础。
    （三）本会第一届第二次代表大会“克服学习障碍，把学习提高一步”的决议，是根据上学期各校学习的初步总结而通过的，并为下学期开展学习指出道路。我们拟在“青年学园”中广泛宣传，并联系各校实际情况进行讨论。各校代表已在同学中进行过传达及讨论的，应把同学意见和讨论总结送给我们。
    一九四九年六月二十九日
