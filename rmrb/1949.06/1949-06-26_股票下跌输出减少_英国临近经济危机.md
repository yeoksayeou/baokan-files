　　Stock Prices Fall, Output Decreases
  　Britain Approaching Economic Crisis
    [Xinhua News Agency, Peiping, 25th] A dispatch from the Polish Press Agency in London: The approaching economic crisis has become the main topic of British newspapers. The government, economic circles, and representatives of the Labor and Conservative parties are all generally anxious. No one doubts that a depression is unavoidable; the only disagreement is about when the crisis will occur. Some economists predict that the crisis will occur this fall. The timing of Britain's crisis depends on the outbreak of the crisis in the United States. Therefore, all signs of an economic downturn in the United States are being carefully studied in Britain. The first stage of the American depression has already caused a sharp decrease in British exports to the dollar area, creating an extremely critical financial situation in Britain. The British stock market has recently experienced a sharp decline, and the serious decline in government stocks, foreign currencies, and gold prices has continued for several days, with this trend reaching a crisis level on the 21st. Government stocks began to be sold off in large quantities, and prices plummeted. It is expected that this situation will not recover for a considerable period. British financial experts explain that the reasons for this panic are: the serious decline in British exports to the dollar area, which means an increase in the dollar deficit; the growing danger of the collapse of the sterling area under American pressure; the fierce American protest against the Anglo-Argentine agreement; and everyone's fear of the devaluation of the pound.

　　股票下跌输出减少
  　英国临近经济危机
    【新华社北平二十五日电】波兰通讯社伦敦讯：经济危机的接近已成为英国报纸的主要论题。政府、经济界以及工党和保守党的代表，都普遍感到焦虑。没有人怀疑萧条是无可避免的，意见的分歧只在于危机何时发生。有些经济界人士预料危机会在今秋发生。英国的危机的时刻要看危机在美国的爆发。因此，美国经济跌落的一切征象，使英国都受到仔细的研究。美国的萧条的第一阶段业已使英国对美元区域的出口急剧减少，在英国造成了极端危急的财政局势。英国股票市场最近剧烈下跌，政府股票、外币和黄金价格的严重下跌已继续数日，这一趋势在二十一日达到危机程度。政府股票开始大量抛售，价格剧跌。预料这一情势在相当时期内不会复原。英国金融专家说明这一恐慌的原因在于：英国对美元地区出口的严重下降，这意味着美元赤字的增加；在美国压力下英镑区域崩溃的危险的增长；美国对英阿（根廷）协定的猛烈抗议和大家对英镑贬值的恐惧。
