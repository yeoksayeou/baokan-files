　　Segmented Responsibility
  　Specific Measures
    [Our Newspaper's Report] To ensure the safety of major postal routes during the rainy season, the North China Postal Administration has decided to implement a segmented responsibility management system for major postal routes: (1) Train postal routes: the Pingbao, Pingsui, Pinggu, and Pingmen lines are the responsibility of the Beijing Administration; the Beining and Jinpu lines are the responsibility of the Tianjin Administration; the Yuling line is the responsibility of the Taiyuan Administration; the Shide and Shitai lines are the responsibility of the Shijiazhuang Bureau; and the Daoqing, Xinzheng, and Hanshe lines are the responsibility of the Taihang Administration (with the Hanwu section of the Hanshe route being the responsibility of the Handan Bureau). If any of the responsible bureaus encounter obstructions or interruptions, they should handle them according to the regulations for hiring temporary staff to ensure immediate resumption of operations. (2) Automobile postal routes: the Baoshi section will be converted to a horse-drawn carriage postal route from June 10th due to bridge demolition and will be the responsibility of the Jizhong Administration; the Heng(shui) Wei(xian) section and the Wei(xian) Lin(qing) section will be the responsibility of the Jinan Administration and will be equipped with horse-drawn rubber-wheeled carts. If automobile service on the Shihandan section is suspended during the rainy season, mail south of Shahe will be rerouted via the Hengweihan line; the Changzhi-Jincheng section will be the responsibility of the Taiyue Administration; the Chang(zhi)-Xiang(yuan) section and the Mi(yun)-Gu(beikou) section will be the responsibility of the Changzhi and Miyun Bureaus, respectively. (3) Horse-drawn carriage postal routes: the Han(dan)-An(yang) section will be the responsibility of the Handan Bureau; the Anxin(xiang) section will be the responsibility of the Taihang Bureau; and the Taigu-Changzhi section will be the responsibility of the Taiyuan Bureau. In addition, temporary hiring measures are stipulated. If any line encounters an accident, the nearby post office should immediately hire temporary staff or organize land transport to rush delivery, ensuring that mail does not stop midway. If rivers are encountered, boats should be used, or river-crossing teams should be organized to transport mail.
