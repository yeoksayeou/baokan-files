　　Xinhua News Agency, Peiping, 16th. TASS reported on the 14th, citing Dutch newspaper sources: The Central Committee of the Indonesian Communist Party, which is currently persisting in underground struggle, recently issued a letter to the Indonesian people, calling on the people to be vigilant against the conspiracies of the US-Dutch imperialists and the Hatta-Sukarno national traitor clique.

　　According to an Associated Press dispatch: Indonesian Communist underground workers plastered slogans all over Yogyakarta on the night of the 12th, denouncing the Hatta clique for selling out all the interests of the Indonesian nation to the imperialists. The slogans revealed that the reason the Dutch allowed Hatta and others to return to Yogyakarta was because the Hatta clique agreed to help the imperialists stop the ongoing anti-imperialist guerrilla war.

　　The Dutch Communist Party's organ, De Waarheid, commented on these events on the 14th, pointing out that the verbal agreement reached between the Netherlands and Hatta on May 7th under the instigation of the United States is merely a worthless piece of paper. The newspaper pointed out that the US-Dutch imperialists want to use the help of the Hatta clique to force the honest Indonesian people to submit. But the Indonesian guerrillas are answering this conspiracy with a raging guerrilla war in Java and Sumatra. De Waarheid pointed out: The Dutch government has embarked on a path of adventure. Every day our youth are sent to the battlefield, and millions of Dutch currency are spent on military operations. The government is completely on a dead end. The newspaper emphasized: The Dutch Communist Party reiterates that there is only one way to resolve the conflict: recognize the Republic of Indonesia as an independent state; form a new republican government represented by the groups currently leading the guerrilla war; and withdraw Dutch troops from Indonesia.

　　印尼共产党向人民号召
  　警惕美荷新阴谋
    【新华社北平十六日电】塔斯社十四日引荷兰报纸的消息说：正在坚持地下斗争的印尼共产党中央委员会，最近发表告印尼人民书，号召人民警惕美荷帝国主义者和哈达、苏加诺民族叛卖集团的阴谋。
    另据美联社讯：印尼共产党地下工作者十二日晚在日惹全城遍贴标语，斥责哈达集团把印尼民族的一切利益出卖给帝国主义者。标语揭露荷兰之所以允许哈达等返回日惹，是因为哈达集团同意帮助帝国主义者停止现在进行中的反帝游击战争。
    荷兰共产党机关报真理报十四日在评论这些事情时指出：荷兰与哈达间在美国授意下于五月七日达成的口头协议，仅仅是一张什么效力也没有的废纸。该报指出：美荷帝国主义者想要在哈达集团的帮助下来迫使诚实的印尼人民屈膝。但是印尼游击队正以在爪哇和苏门答腊进行如火如荼的游击战争来回答这种阴谋。真理报指出：荷兰政府走上了冒险的道路，每天我们的青年被送到战场上，千百万的荷兰币耗费在军事行动上。政府完全走上了死路。该报强调说：荷兰共产党再次宣告，解决冲突只有一个办法：承认印尼共和国为独立国家；由现在领导游击战争的团体代表组织新的共和国政府；从印尼撤回荷兰军队。
