　　Granting Value-Guaranteed Loans to Support Industry; Piloting Finished Product Mortgage Loans
　　[Taiyuan Electric Dispatch] To help private industrial and commercial enterprises in Taiyuan City resume operations, and restore and develop production, the People's Bank of China Taiyuan Branch has issued 30 million yuan in industrial and commercial loans. The focus of lending is on the manufacturing of production tools and the production of essential civilian goods, followed by handicrafts. Commercial loans are only granted to individual businesses that genuinely facilitate market material adjustment and production and sales. Low interest rates are adopted for loan interest. Industrial value-guaranteed loans (each physical unit is equivalent to one jin of medium millet, one jin of red sorghum flour, and one chi of Jin Ding cloth, calculated based on the bank's current price of the physical goods) are interest-free within one month, and the interest rate is 3 to 5 per mille per month for more than one month, but during the resumption of work, the interest rate is uniformly calculated at 3 per mille per month. The interest rate for currency loans is 2.7 to 4 per mille per day. Commercial loans generally do not exceed one month, with interest rates of 4 to 6 per mille per day. In order to ensure flexible capital turnover for production, the Taiyuan Branch has also launched mortgage loans. Among them, physical collateral loans are limited to factories, with collateral being finished products, machinery, houses, etc.; physical collateral loans are granted at 70 percent of the appraised value, with the same interest rate as before. Gold and silver collateral loans are available to all industrial and commercial operators. When taking out a loan, gold and silver are calculated at 85 percent of the listed price, and the interest rate is also the same as before. If some industrial and commercial enterprises use gold and silver to resume work and operations, they can enjoy an additional 10% exchange rate (i.e., 10% more will be given when exchanging) at the bank. The bank is currently conducting investigation and preparation work, and the issuance of these loans will begin soon.
