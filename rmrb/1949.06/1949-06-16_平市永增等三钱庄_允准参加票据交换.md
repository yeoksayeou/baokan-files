　　Yongzeng and Two Other Native Banks in Ping City
  　Approved to Participate in Check Clearing
    [This Newspaper's Dispatch] The Yongzeng, Jinhongyu, and Zhongyuan native banks in Ping City were previously unable to participate in check clearing due to their status as exchange businesses. These Yongzeng and other native banks, having completed capital verification and registration last month in accordance with native bank regulations, specifically applied to join the city's check clearing, following the precedent of general banks and firms. It is now understood that the People's Bank of Beiping Branch has approved their participation in the city's check clearing starting this week.
