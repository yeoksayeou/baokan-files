Xinhua News Agency, Peiping, 9th Dispatch: Reports from various sources: The British Labour Party's 48th Annual Conference was held in Blackpool (on the central west coast of England) on the 6th, attended by 1,400 representatives. The conference took place amidst the most serious crisis the Labour Party has faced since coming to power in 1945. The Labour government's corrupt performance has aroused strong dissatisfaction among the public, already causing the Labour Party to suffer defeats in recent local elections and potentially leading to the Labour Party being defeated by the Conservative Party in the 1950 general election. Reuters reported that the opening session of the conference was filled with Labour Party members fiercely criticizing their party leaders, with cabinet ministers being depicted as high-class "courtesans" and denounced for doing "stupid" things.

In an attempt to prevent many members from raising motions on the upcoming general election at the conference, the Labour Party leaders devised a novel "abnormal procedure," namely, requiring proposers to submit all motions to the Executive Committee. The Executive Committee then demanded that the conference could neither amend nor vote on the Labour Party's published document, "Labour Believes in Britain." It is noteworthy that the reactionary heads of the majority of large trade unions voted in favor of the Executive Committee's opinion, while many constituency Labour Party organizations and small trade unions voted against it. However, due to the larger number of votes held by the large trade unions, the Executive Committee's proposal was passed.

At the annual meeting on the 6th, when discussing the expulsion of Labour Party left-wing members Zilliacus and Solley, a vote of 3,020,000 to 1,993,000 was passed to prevent Zilliacus et al. from stating their opinions; and a vote of 4,721,000 to 704,000 was passed to expel the two of them. According to Agence France-Presse: The Labour leaders were surprised by the large number of votes in favor of hearing from Zilliacus and others. The increase in left-wing votes compared to last year has caused concern among Labour leaders.

Zilliacus announced after the vote that in the next general election, he will run as an independent socialist candidate in his current constituency of Gateshead. He said: "I am determined to actively participate in the national movement for peace, and I intend to establish peace committees in every constituency in England." Zilliacus insisted that the current policies of the Labour Party leaders are leading the country directly towards war.

When discussing the Executive Committee's report, the representative from South Hackney protested that the Executive Committee had in fact done nothing to stop fascist activities. During the discussion of the general publicity section of the Executive Committee's report, several representatives protested that the Executive Committee's attitude towards the failures suffered in the municipal elections was too complacent. The representative from Sheffield said that the Labour Party suffered such a large defeat in the municipal elections because the working class was dissatisfied with the huge new budget.

The meeting also discussed a proposal on the effective participation of workers in the management of nationalized industries. When the General Secretary of the Railway Workers' Union, Figgins, presented this proposal, he pointed out that workers did not truly participate in the management of British railways. As an example, he said that there were no workers on the British Transport Commission. Representatives from two districts of the Labour Party rose to speak in support of this proposal. Opposing the proposal were Lawther, Chairman of the National Union of Mineworkers, and Crowther, representing the Executive Committee. The proposal was then withdrawn from the agenda of the conference and submitted to the Executive Committee.

　　英工党年会揭幕　党员猛烈抨击
  　党魁竟压制党员表示意见
    【新华社北平九日电】各方报道：英国工党第四十八届年会六日在布拉克普尔（英国中部西海岸）举行，到有代表一千四百名。会议是在工党自一九四五年当政以来最严重的危机中举行的。工党政府的腐朽政绩在民众中引起强烈不满，已使工党在最近的地方选举中遭受失败，并可能使工党有在一九五○年大选中被保守党击败的危险。路透社说，年会的开幕会中充满了工党党员对其党魁的猛烈抨击，内阁的部长们被描绘为高等“歌妓”和被斥为在作“愚蠢”的事。
    为了想避免许多党员在大会上提出对明年大选问题的议案，工党党魁们竟想出了别开生面的所谓“非正常程序”的办法，即要求提案人把提案都转交给执委会。执委会又要求年会不能修正也不能表决工党所发表的文件：“劳工相信英国”。值得注意的是多数大工会的反动头子投票赞成执委会的意见，而很多的选区工党组织和小工会却投票反对，但由于大工会所占的票数较多，致使执委会的方案得以通过。
    六日年会上讨论开除工党左翼议员齐里亚库斯和索莱时，以三百零二万票对一百九十九万三千票通过不许齐里亚库斯等申述其意见；并以四百七十二万一千票对七十万四千票通过开除他们两人。据法新社称：赞成听取齐里亚库斯等发言者的票数之多，使工党首领们惊讶。左翼票数比去年增加，引起了工党领袖们的忧虑。
    齐里亚库斯在表决后宣布：在下届大选中，他将作为独立的社会主义者候选人在他现在的选区加次赫德竞选。他说：“我决心积极参加全国争取和平的运动，我打算在英格兰的每一个选区成立和平委员会。”齐里亚库斯坚称工党领袖目前的政策是把国家一直引向战争。
    在讨论执委会的报告时，南哈克内区代表抗议执委会事实上未做任何事情来制止法西斯活动。在讨论执委会报告中关于一般宣传部分时，几个代表抗议执委会对在市选中所遭受的失败所采的态度过于自得。雪菲尔德的代表说，工党在市选中遭到这样大的失败，是因为工人阶级不满于庞大的新预算。
    会议并讨论关于工人有效参加国营工业管理的建议案。铁路工会总书记费金斯提出这个议案时指出：工人并没有真正参加英国铁路的管理，举例说，英国运输委员会里面并没有工人。有两个地区的工党代表起来发言支持这一提案。反对这个议案的则有全国矿工联盟主席劳瑟和代表执委会的克劳福。该议案遂被从大会的议程中撤回，而提交给执委会。
