　　Brief Explanation of Pesticide Terminology

　　I. Sodium Fluosilicate: A byproduct of phosphate production, inexpensive, and possessing both toxic and contact action. It is a common modern locust control agent. When combined with wheat bran to create poisoned bait and scattered in areas with locust nymphs, the nymphs die shortly after eating it. It is particularly effective against first, second, and third instar nymphs.
　　II. Sodium Arsenite: Made from one pound of white arsenic, two pounds of sodium carbonate, and one gallon of water. First, dissolve the sodium carbonate in water, then add the white arsenic to the sodium carbonate solution and boil until all the white arsenic is completely dissolved. If the water evaporates, add water to make up the difference.
　　This medicine is used to poison locusts, and its effectiveness is more than double that of white arsenic.

　　农药名辞浅释
    一、氟矽酸钠：为制造磷酸之副产品，价值低廉，兼有毒杀及触杀作用，为现代治蝗通用药剂，与麦麸配合，制成毒饵，撒布于跳蝻区域内，蝗蝻食后不久即毙，特别对于一、二、三龄跳蝻效果最佳。
    二、亚砒酸钠：由白砒一磅、炭酸钠二磅、水一加仑三者化合而成。先将炭酸钠溶于水中，然后将白砒加入炭酸钠液中，煮沸至所有白砒完全溶解为止。如水分蒸发，则加水补足。
    此药用以毒杀蝗虫，其效力要超过白砒一倍以上。
