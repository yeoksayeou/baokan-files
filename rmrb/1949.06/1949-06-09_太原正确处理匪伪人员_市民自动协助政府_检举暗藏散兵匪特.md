　　Taiyuan Correctly Handles Puppet Personnel
　　Citizens Automatically Assist the Government in Exposing Hidden Scattered Soldiers and Bandit Secret Agents
    [Taiyuan Telegram] Due to the correct implementation of the policy towards enemy puppet personnel, the citizens of Taiyuan have spontaneously risen up and actively assisted the People's Government in exposing Chiang Kai-shek and Yan Xishan's secret agents, scattered soldiers, and vagrant bandits. In the first half of May, mass meetings for handling Yan's puppet street and neighborhood personnel were held throughout the city and the eight outer districts. After the masses poured out their grievances and the puppet personnel confessed their crimes and signed pledges, the masses felt elated and justice prevailed, feeling that "the skies have cleared." After the Fourth District held its meeting, it immediately launched a campaign to eliminate the remaining bandits and secret agents. On the first day in Dadong Street, more than sixty Yan secret agents and scattered soldiers were exposed. The masses in Guoshi Street also reported more than thirty people. Each street has cultivated a group of activists. The Sanqiao Street in the Third District, with fifteen activists as the center, is preparing to organize a trade union. In the four districts of the city, there are more than 500 puppet street and neighborhood personnel. With the exception of a small number of those with serious crimes who were punished, because most of them were from poor backgrounds, each street was extremely cautious in handling them. For example, at the hearing session for puppet personnel in the Fourth District, in addition to first pointing out their crimes and allowing them to perform meritorious service to redeem themselves, they also called on the puppet neighborhood personnel from poor families who were forced to participate to return to the masses. Therefore, after the meeting, the puppet neighborhood chiefs actively participated in catching bandits. For example, on the night after the First District held its meeting, the puppet neighborhood chief reported three secret agents.

　　太原正确处理匪伪人员
   　市民自动协助政府  检举暗藏散兵匪特
    【太原电】由于正确地执行了对敌伪人员的政策，太原市民已自动起来积极协助人民政府检举蒋阎特务、散兵、游勇等工作。五月上半月，市内各区与外八区均普遍召开了处理阎伪街闾人员的大会，经过群众诉苦、伪人员认罪具结后，群众扬眉吐气，正气伸张，都觉得“天晴了”。四区开过大会后，紧接着展开了肃清残余匪特的运动，大东街第一天即检举出阎特、散兵等六十余名。国师街群众亦报告出三十余名。各街均培养出一批积极分子。三区三桥街以十五个积极分子为中心，正筹备组织行业工会。市内四个区，共伪街人员五百余名，除少数罪恶大的予以惩处外，因大部为贫苦出身，处理时各街均极慎重。如四区在伪人员听训会上，除首先指出他们的罪恶，许其立功赎罪外，并号召贫苦市民出身的被迫参加的伪闾人员回到群众中来。因此在会后伪闾长也积极参加捉匪。如一区在开完大会的当夜，即有伪闾长报告了三个特务。
