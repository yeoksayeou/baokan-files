Xinhua News Agency, Kaifeng, 30th – The Central China Bureau of the CPC Central Committee, the Central China Military Region of the People's Liberation Army, the Central Plains People's Government, the Political Department of the Fourth Field Army of the People's Liberation Army, and the Party, government, military, and troop organs of Kaifeng City, Henan Province, held a victory celebration rally at the Central Plains University Auditorium in Kaifeng on the 26th to warmly celebrate the great victories of the People's Liberation Army in successively occupying major cities such as Shanghai, Wuhan, Xi'an, Nanchang, and Jiujiang. In his speech at the meeting, Deng Zihui, Chairman of the Central Plains People's Government, pointed out that the liberation of major cities such as Shanghai, Wuhan, Xi'an, Nanchang, and Jiujiang will play an important role in Henan's economic construction. In the past, the main part of Henan's economy relied on the export of agricultural products. The liberation of these major cities will provide a broad market for Henan's agricultural products. To this end, Chairman Deng proposed three basic principles for restoring and building Henan's economy. First, vigorously restore and develop industrial and agricultural production, but at present, it is first necessary to unblock commerce to prepare for the premise of industrial construction. Second, develop state-owned enterprises in a planned and organized manner, but at the same time, attention must be paid to restoring private industrial and commercial enterprises. Third, restore railway, highway, and river transportation, establish state-owned transportation companies, and restore private transshipment companies so that commodities can be exchanged. Chairman Deng pointed out that adopting this approach can strengthen and consolidate the construction of the rear and increase the strength to support the front.
　　Xinhua News Agency, Beiping, 30th – Liberated areas everywhere joyously celebrate the liberation of Shanghai. In Beiping, when the news of Shanghai's liberation came out, workers, students, and citizens immediately and spontaneously formed many parades and Yangko teams, cheering and dancing in the streets. Personnel from the Beiping Library, the Palace Museum, the Great Dictionary Compilation Office, and other agencies also spontaneously gathered more than a thousand people to march in celebration. Trams and buses were immediately plastered with various celebratory slogans. The employees of the Postal Savings and Remittance Bureau sent a telegram to the employees of the Shanghai Postal Savings and Remittance Bureau on the same day, congratulating them on their liberation and asking them to stay at their posts and assist the Military Control Commission in taking over.
　　The people of Tianjin, who have close economic ties with Shanghai, are particularly excited about the liberation of this largest industrial and commercial city in the country. Cheers and gongs and drums resounded throughout the city. Business leaders such as Zhu Jisheng, Li Zhuchen, and Luo Zongqiang expressed optimism that materials from the north and south would be exchanged and adjusted as a result. Zhu Jisheng, General Manager of Renli Woolen Textile Company, said: "Salt, alkali, coal, cement, etc. from the north can now be sold to the south, and Shanghai's flour and industrial raw materials can be transported to the north, which provides favorable conditions for future economic prosperity and industrial development." Professors from Nankai and Beiyang Universities have expressed their views on the liberation of Shanghai, believing that the liberation of Shanghai will accelerate the liberation of the whole country.
　　After hearing the news, Shenyang’s factories, schools, organs, and citizens’ Yangko teams all turned out. The repair team organized by the Shenyang Railway Bridge Factory is preparing to enter the pass and go south immediately to build railway bridges for the People’s Liberation Army.
　　The people along the Jinghu (Beijing-Shanghai) Railway are even more excited about the liberation of Shanghai. After Nanjing learned of the liberation of Shanghai's urban area on the 25th, prices generally fell. Cotton yarn prices fell by 20%, and general cloth prices fell by about 10%. Railway workers are actively preparing for the full operation of the Jinghu Railway, and they successfully achieved their goal on the 27th. Factories and shops are actively preparing to go to Shanghai to purchase machinery and goods.
　　The workers of Wuxi, an industrial city, were all overjoyed after hearing the news of the liberation of Shanghai, believing that industrial production would develop rapidly. On the 25th, shipping companies put up advertisements such as "Direct to Shanghai, Arrive on the Same Day," and on the 26th, they dispatched nine ships. On the 25th, the engineers of the Wuxi Engineering Section of the Jinghu Highway set off for Shanghai to repair highway bridges. The news of the liberation of Shanghai greatly encouraged the industrial and commercial circles in Wuhan. Many industrial and commercial households are preparing to develop their business. They believe that the shipping between Hankou and Shanghai will be rapidly restored from now on, and the long-stagnant trade between the inland and other ports will become increasingly developed.

　　华中各界与各解放区人民
    欢腾庆祝大上海解放
    【新华社开封三十日电】中共中央华中局、人民解放军华中军区、中原人民政府、人民解放军第四野战军司令部政治部及河南省开封市党政军机关部队，于二十六日假开封中原大学礼堂召开祝捷大会，热烈庆祝解放军接连占领上海、武汉、西安、南昌、九江等名城的伟大胜利。中原人民政府邓子恢主席在会上的讲话中指出上海、武汉、西安、南昌、九江等大城市的解放，对于河南的经济建设将起重要的作用。过去河南经济的主要部分，是依靠农产品出口。这些大城市的解放，将使河南的农产品得到广大市场。于此，邓主席提出恢复与建设河南经济的三个基本方针。第一、大力恢复与发展工农业生产，但当前首先要畅通商业，以准备建设工业的前提。第二、有计划有组织地发展公营企业，但同时必须注意恢复私营工商业。第三、恢复铁路公路河流的交通，建立公营运输公司和恢复私营的转运公司，使商品得以交流。邓主席指出：采取这个方针，才能加强与巩固后方的建设，增加支援前线的力量。
    【新华社北平三十日电】解放区各地欢腾庆祝上海解放。在北平，当上海解放的消息传出后，工人、学生和市民们立即自动组成了许多游行队伍和秧歌队，在街上欢呼扭唱。北平图书馆、故宫博物院、大辞典编纂处等机关人员也自动集合千余人游行庆祝。电车和公共汽车上顿时都被贴满各种各样的庆祝标语，邮政储金汇业局的职工们当天就致电上海邮政储金汇业局的职工们，庆贺他们解放，并要他们安守职务，协助军管会接管。
    在经济上和上海有着密切关系的天津的人民，对于这个全国第一大工商业都市的解放，特别感到兴奋。全市到处响起一片欢呼和锣鼓声。工商界人士朱继圣、李烛尘、罗宗强等都因南北物资将由此得以交流调剂而表示乐观。仁立毛呢纺织公司总经理朱继圣说：“北方的盐、碱、煤、洋灰等从此可以南销，上海的面粉及工业原料可以北运，这给今后经济的繁荣与工业的发展，提供了有利的条件。”南开、北洋等大学教授纷纷对上海解放发表感想，认为上海的解放，将加速全国的解放。
    沈阳闻讯后，各工厂、学校、机关及市民的秧歌队，一齐出动，沈阳铁路桥梁工厂组织的抢修队，准备即日入关南下，为解放军架设铁路桥梁。
    京沪路沿线各地人民对上海的解放更兴奋万状。南京在二十五日得悉上海市区解放后，物价就普遍下降，棉纱价下降百分之二十，一般布价下降百分之十左右。铁路工人都积极准备京沪路全线通车，并已于二十七日胜利地达到了他们的目的。各工厂、商店都积极筹备去上海采办机器货物。
    工业城市无锡的工人们听到上海解放消息后，都对工业生产将迅速发展而欢欣鼓舞。轮船局在二十五日就纷纷挂出“直放上海、当天到达”的广告，在二十六日就开出了九艘轮船。京沪公路无锡工务段的工程师，在二十五日就出发上海抢修公路桥梁。上海解放的消息给予了武汉的工商界极大鼓舞。许多工商业户准备开展业务，他们相信汉口与上海间的航运将从此迅速恢复，停滞已久的内地与外埠的贸易将日趋发达。
