A Corner of the Beiping Industrial Exhibition
Introduction to Agricultural Machinery
By our reporters Bai Qing and Shang Kai

　　At the open-air plaza of the Beiping Industrial Exhibition, crowds of visitors are drawn to the various agricultural machines, witnessing for the first time the meticulously crafted products of all the staff of the North China Agricultural Machinery Factory. Among these agricultural machines, three are used for agricultural irrigation: one is a five-inch diameter electric water pump, capable of pumping 140 tons of water per hour. If used for irrigating fields with well water or river water, it can solve the irrigation needs of more than ten hectares of land. Another is a four-inch diameter electric high-pressure water pump, used for pumping water to highland fields or water towers, pumping 100 tons of water per hour, and is also suitable for factories and mines. The other is the animal-powered waterwheel, commonly used in rural areas, which can irrigate three to four mu of land per day.

　　There are four types of new-style plows for cultivation. Some are specially for plowing hard soil or wasteland, some are for deep plowing, and some are designed for their lightness. All are sturdy and durable.

　　There are two types of seed drills, which can replace the old-style seed drills. One is a ten-row seed drill, which can be pulled by livestock or tractors. It sows ten rows at a time, and various seeds can be used. The spacing between rows and the distance can be adjusted freely. The sowing is neat, and it can sow forty to fifty mu per day. The other is a planter, which sows one row at a time and is very light to push or pull. It can sow five mu of vegetable garden per day.

　　The reporters squeezed through the crowded people and specially visited the blue and brown cultivators. When there are weeds between rows of crops or the soil is too dry, it can be used to weed the ground. There are two types on display here: one is with three shovels, modeled after the Soviet style; the other is with five shovels, the shovel shape has been modified, and the soil entering force is very strong. These two types of cultivators have been actually tested, and the depth and width can be adjusted. In particular, the three-shovel cultivator is more popular among the masses near Beiping, saving about ten times the time compared to using the old-fashioned hoe to weed the ground. After the crops are harvested, the grains of the ears of grain must be extracted. The electric and manual threshers and seed selectors on display here are specially for doing this.

　　The leather roller gin can prevent the cottonseeds from breaking and the fibers of the cotton wool from breaking. The ginned cotton is of high quality. It can be towed by a one-horsepower electric roller or an animal. It can gin more than one thousand catties of seed cotton per day. There is also a rolling blade type chaff cutter, which can be powered by electricity or manpower, and is twenty times faster than ordinary straw cutters. It is not only suitable for livestock farms, but also for paper mills and pharmaceutical factories. It is also very convenient for farmers to chop grass to feed livestock.

　　The exhibits also include American-made tractors and cultivators, Soviet-made disc harrows, tooth harrows, hay balers, lawnmowers, harvesters, etc., all of which are planned to be copied. Among them, harvesters are divided into two types: one is a stacking harvester, which automatically forms piles after harvesting. The other is a bundling harvester, which automatically forms bundles after harvesting. The bundling device is as ingenious as a sewing machine. In addition, there is a combined harvester that can automatically harvest all the way to the grain, and automatically fluff the cotton when harvesting cotton. This is a higher degree of mechanization of agricultural production and has been fully used in the socialist Soviet Union. A person in charge of the factory told reporters: "Although our manufacturing conditions are not yet sufficient, under the leadership of the Communist Party and the people's leader Chairman Mao, relying on the wisdom and creation of the working class, we will definitely be able to manufacture more and better agricultural machinery in the future."

　　In the first exhibition room, there are sprayers, powder sprayers, and various insecticides manufactured by the branch factory. The important insecticide is rotenone powder, and the current production volume has more than doubled that of the Kuomintang period. Rotenone powder has the effect of preventing and exterminating pests such as cotton aphids, tent caterpillars on fruit trees, and pear psyllids. Using less than one catty of medicine per mu can increase the yield of seed cotton by twenty catties, up to one hundred and fifty catties. The factory is now preparing to distribute more than 700 sprayers to farmers for use. More than 98,000 catties of pesticides have been distributed or sold. In the future, it is planned to produce mole cricket powder and liquid, and lime sulfur powder to prevent and control fruit tree insect diseases.

　　More and more visitors are gathering. With surprised expressions, they are pointing and talking around these agricultural machines. Farmers who have rushed in from outside the city are warmly stroking it and showing smiles. Because they have begun to see the beautiful prospect of agricultural mechanization in North China here.

　　北平工业展览会一角
  　农业机器介绍
    本报记者  柏青  商恺
    在北平工业展览会的露天广场上，成群的观众被各式各样的农业机器吸引着，他们第一次看到华北农业机械厂全体职工精心制造的产品。在这些农业机器中，有三种是属于农业灌溉方面用的，一种是五英寸口径的电力抽水泵，每小时能抽水一百四十吨，如用机器井或河水浇地，能解决十顷以上的田地灌溉。一种是四英寸口径的电力高压抽水机，是向高坡田或水塔上压水用的，每小时压水一百吨，对工厂矿山也都适用。另一种即是农村普通用的畜力挂斗水车，每天可浇地三、四亩。
    新式耕地犁有四种，有的是专耕硬土质或开荒的，有的是专门深耕的，也有的为了取其轻便。都坚固耐用。
    播种机有两种，可代替旧式耩地耧。一种是十行播种机，用牲口拉或拖拉机带都可以。一次播十行，各种种子都可用。行间、距离的大小都可自由调剂。播苗整齐，一天能播四、五十亩。另一种是点播器，一次播一行，手推或人拉都非常轻便。种菜园每天可播种五亩。
    记者挤过拥挤的人群，特意参观了涂着蓝色、褐色的中耕器。在农作物行间有杂草或土质太干的时候，可用来锄地。这里陈列的有两种：一种是三个铲的，是仿造苏联的式样；一种是五个铲的，铲型经过改造，入土力很强。这两种中耕器都经过实际试验，深浅宽窄可以调剂。特别是三铲中耕器更为北平附近群众所欢迎，较用旧式锄锄地节省时间十倍左右。农作物收获后，要把谷穗的粒子打出来，这里展览的电力、人力两用的脱壳机、选种机，就专门来干这个事情。
    皮滚式的轧花机能使棉籽不破，棉絮的纤维不断。轧出的棉花品质很高。用一匹马力的电滚子或一匹牲口就能拖带。每天轧皮棉一千多斤。另有一种滚刀式的铡草机，电力人力都可用，比普通铡刀要快二十倍。不但牲畜场适用，造纸厂、制药厂也可以用，农民铡草喂牲口也很方便。
    展览品中还有美国造的拖拉机、中耕器，苏联造的圆盘耙、钉齿耙、捆草机、割草机、收割机等，这些都准备仿造。其中收割机分两种：一种是堆割机，割完后自动打成一堆一堆。一种是捆割机，割完后自动打成一捆一捆。打捆的装置象缝纫机一样巧妙。此外还有一种联合收割机，能从收割一直到打出谷粒，收棉花时把棉花自动弹好。这是农业生产较高度的机械化，在社会主义的苏联已经完全使用了。该厂一位负责人告记者说：“目前虽然我们的制造条件还不够，但在共产党和人民领袖毛主席领导下，依靠工人阶级的智慧和创造，今后一定能制造更多更好的农业机械。”
    在第一展览室里，有分厂制造的喷雾器、喷粉器和各种杀虫药剂。重要的杀虫药剂是鱼藤粉，现在生产量已超过国民党时期一倍以上。鱼藤粉对于棉花蚜虫，果树天幕毛虫，梨狗子等害虫，都有防止和扑灭的效能。每亩用药不到一斤，便可增产皮棉二十斤，最多到一百五十斤。现该厂准备将七百多架喷雾机分配给农民使用。已经分配或卖出之农药达九万八千余斤。今后计划着生产治蝼蛄药粉和药水，防治果树虫病害的石灰硫磺粉。
    观众越聚越多了，他们怀着惊喜的心情围绕着这些农业机械在那里指划谈论，从城外赶来的农民，热情的抚摩着它，露出了笑容。因为他们在这里已开始看到了华北农业机械化的美丽的远景。
