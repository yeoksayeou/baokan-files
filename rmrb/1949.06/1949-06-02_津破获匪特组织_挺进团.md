　　Tianjin Smashes Bandit-Special Agent Organization "Vanguard Corps"
　　[Tianjin, 29th dispatch] The Tianjin Public Security Bureau recently smashed the Kuomintang secret agent organization "China Youth Vanguard Corps" that was lurking in the city. The leading special agent Liu Jie and others were all arrested. This corps, referred to as the "Vanguard Corps," appeared before liberation under the guise of a middle-of-the-road line, organizing the so-called "Student United Salvation Vanguard Corps," specializing in investigating, arresting, and assassinating revolutionary workers and progressive students. After the liberation of Tianjin, the main culprits of this secret agent organization, "Corps Commander" Liu Jie and "Military Statistics Bureau Internal Defense Group Secretary" Ni Jinrong, and others remained unrepentant and continued to engage in espionage activities. After careful investigation by the Tianjin Public Security Bureau, Liu Jie and other seven principal culprits were all arrested on the 22nd of this month. In addition, Zheng Shanfu, the "Beiping Station Mongolian Border Intelligence Group Leader" of the Kuomintang "Bureau of Investigation and Statistics," who continued to engage in reactionary sabotage activities after the liberation of Tianjin, has also been arrested separately by the Tianjin Public Security organs.

　　津破获匪特组织“挺进团”
    【天津二十九日电】天津市公安局最近破获潜伏市内的国民党特务组织“中国青年挺进团”，首要特务分子刘杰等全部被捕。该团简称“挺进团”，解放前曾经以伪装的中间路线面目出现，组织所谓“学生联合救亡挺进团”，专门调查、逮捕、暗杀革命工作人员和进步学生。天津解放后，该特务组织的首要分子“团长”刘杰和“军统内卫组书记官”倪晋墉等仍不悔悟，继续进行特务活动，经天津市公安局严密侦察，在本月二十二号将刘杰等七名首要分子全部逮捕。另外，在天津解放后仍然续续反动破坏活动的国民党“保密局”“北平站蒙边情报组长”郑善夫等也已经分别被天津市公安机关逮捕。
