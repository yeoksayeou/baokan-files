Xinhua News Agency, New York, June 14th: Radio commentator Steel, who recently resumed regular broadcasts on a New York City radio station, stated that the continuing rise in anti-communist hysteria indicates that fascist tendencies in the United States are increasing day by day. Steel criticized the Hobbs Bill, saying that under this bill, the United States could effectively establish concentration camps to indefinitely detain innocent American citizens. Steel also stated that the "trial" of the leaders of the American Communist Party has begun to resemble the 1933 Leipzig "trial" of Dimitrov. Steel criticized Judge Medina's sentencing of Gates, Winston, and Hall to imprisonment for refusing to inform, saying that bringing these defendants into court every day shows that "a system that must resort to such tactics when 'trying' people accused of having certain beliefs is inherently lacking in confidence." Steel declared: "The current arrest frenzy is harassing the American people and creating ample opportunities for fascism."

　　斯蒂尔广播评论反动法案
  　美法西斯主义倾向日增
    实际上美国将成集中营
    【新华社北平十四日电】塔斯社纽约讯：最近在纽约市广播电台恢复定时广播的广播评论员斯蒂尔称：反共歇斯底里的继续增高，表明美国的法西斯主义倾向正日甚一日。斯蒂尔批评霍布士法案说，根据这个法案，美国可以实际上建立集中营，来无定期地拘留无辜的美国公民。斯蒂尔又称：“审讯”美共领袖案，已开始与一九三三年莱比锡“审讯”季米特洛夫的案子相似。斯蒂尔对盖兹、温斯顿及霍尔三人因拒绝告密曾被法官麦迪纳判处监禁一事批评说：每天都把这些被告带进法庭，这种作法显示：“在‘审讯’因有某种信仰而被控的人时，竟必须采取这种行径的制度，其本身就是缺乏自信心的”。斯蒂尔宣称：“当前的逮捕狂使美国人民遭受烦扰，并且为法西斯主义制造着充分有利的机会。”
