　　Visiting Beiping
　　New Glass Factory

　　Leaving Chongwenmen and heading south along the tram line, turning at Hongqiao, one can see a white wall like a belt in the distance, with a tall chimney inside, spewing thick black smoke. This is the site of the newly built Beiping Glass Factory – revived through the nurturing of the people's democratic government.
　　The predecessor of the new glass factory was the Beizhi Glass Factory during the Japanese occupation, with more than 300 workers. At that time, the products were mainly supplied to the Japanese imperialist war. After the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, the Kuomintang began to severely ravage it. In less than two years, the machines rusted, the factory gates closed, and the workers were left homeless.
　　The Kuomintang's destruction was too terrible! Of the 250 houses in the entire factory, some collapsed, some crumbled, and most became piles of rubble. Two gas generators were nakedly exposed in the ruins, covered with thick yellow rust. Last winter, a group of Kuomintang bandits used the factory's doors, windows, and tables and chairs as fuel.
　　Beiping was liberated, and the Enterprise Bureau of the Beiping Municipal People's Government immediately began preparing for the resumption of work. Old workers gathered again in the dilapidated factory. After everyone's discussion, a plan for restoration and construction was formulated. Everyone began to repair the furnaces and wipe the machines with joy, and helped the carpenters and masons to move bricks and transport soil to repair the houses. After a month of hard preparation, the furnace workshop and surrounding walls were first repaired. The dilapidated factory took on a new look and officially started work on May 12.
　　Every workshop is filled with roaring flames, the machines are constantly turning, and the workers are working nervously and excitedly. A middle-aged worker told the reporter: When the factory was shut down during the Kuomintang period, his life was immediately over. After Beiping was liberated, he came back with a smile and immediately participated in the preparations for resuming work.
　　The warehouse is full of various glass instruments that have just left the factory. Mr. Wei Guozhang, who participated in the technical guidance of the factory, said: The new Beiping Glass Factory is the only state-owned glass instrument factory in North China. The restoration of this factory will make a significant contribution to scientific research in North China. Mr. Wei picked up a newly made mercury vacuum pump from the table and said: "In the past, most of the instruments relied on foreign countries, and even if a glass tube was broken, it had to be sent abroad for repair; now we can not only repair them, but also manufacture such complex instruments. Only the Pyrex glass tube with the greatest fire resistance cannot be made by ourselves, but we must work hard to study it." The factory's future business policy is mainly to produce glass instruments. It is planned to cooperate with universities and industrial and mining research institutes to improve the quality. It is also planned to continue to recruit workers and train specialized tubing workers, so as to maximize its effectiveness in the new democratic construction in the future.

### 访问北平  新建玻璃厂

　　访问北平
    新建玻璃厂
    商恺
    出崇文门，沿电车路南行，转过红桥，远远望见一条白墙如带，墙内烟囱高耸，吐着浓黑的烟。这就是北平新建玻璃厂的厂址——经过人民民主政权的培养，它复活了。
    新建玻璃厂的前身，是日寇侵占时期的北支硝子厂，工人有三百余名，当时产品主要是供给日本帝国主义的侵略战争。抗日战争胜利后，国民党开始了对它的严重摧残，不到二年，机器锈了，厂门关了，工人流落在街头。
    国民党破坏得太惨了！全场二百五十间房屋，倒的倒，塌的塌，大部分变成瓦砾堆。两座汽体发生炉，赤裸裸的暴露在废墟上，生满了厚厚的黄锈。去年冬天，国民党一群匪军把厂里的门窗桌椅也作了燃料。
    北平解放了，北平市人民政府企业局当即着手筹备复工。残破的厂子里，又聚集了旧日的工人。经过大家讨论，制订了恢复与修建计划。大家开始欢笑着修熔炉，擦机器，并帮助瓦木工人搬砖运土，修补房屋。经过一个月的辛勤筹备，首先修好了炉厂和垣墙，残破的厂子，换了一副新的面目，五月十二日正式开工。
    每一个工作间都是炉火熊熊，机器在不停的转动，工友们紧张而兴奋的工作着。一个中年工人告诉记者：国民党时期工厂停工，他的生活立刻就完了。北平解放了，他带着欢笑走回来，立即参加筹备复工。
    库房里堆满了刚出厂的各种玻璃仪器。在该厂参加技术指导的魏国璋先生说：北平新建玻璃厂是华北唯一的公营玻璃仪器厂。该厂的恢复，对华北的科学研究将有重大的贡献。魏先生从桌子上拿起刚做好的水银抽空仪说：“在过去，大部仪器都是依靠外国，破一个玻璃管也要送到外国去修理；现在咱们不但能修理，而且象这样复杂的仪器也能制造了。只有耐火性最大的派列斯玻璃管，尚不能自制，但我们要努力研究。”该厂今后的业务方针，主要是生产玻璃仪器。准备与各大学和工矿研究室合作研究，力求改良品质。并拟继续招收工人，培养专门管子工，以便在今后新民主主义的建设中尽量发挥它的效能。
