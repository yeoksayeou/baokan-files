Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, June 26th: All academic institutions, public universities, middle and primary schools, and Kuomintang cultural publishing institutions in Nanjing have been taken over. During the inventory process, thanks to the active assistance of all teachers, students, and staff, the work has progressed extremely smoothly. Seventeen well-known academic institutions, including the Academia Sinica, the Central Geological Survey, the Mineral Exploration Institute, and the Central Library, with the enthusiastic assistance of their staff and thorough preparation, not only completed the inventory work during the takeover phase but also carried out preliminary sorting. The Central Library inventoried more than 800,000 books in ten days, shortening the inventory time by half compared to the original estimate. All agricultural experimental institutions have never stopped experimental work during the inventory process. Many valuable instruments, specimens, and antiques have been preserved without loss due to the careful and meticulous work. Thirteen universities and colleges, with the active participation and assistance of students, professors, and staff, quickly completed the inventory of large and complex institutions. After the announcement of the takeover order at National Central University, 2,800 of the 3,800 teachers, students, and staff assisted in the inventory work. The departments formed 272 groups to carry out the work. All ten of the school's "Zhongda Voice" (loudspeakers) broadcasted the inventory progress of each group and the issues to be noted every day. With our enthusiastic assistance, we inventoried 26 research institutes, two hospitals, and nine farms in seven colleges and 64 departments within four days. The drama school's small-scale quick reports were exceptionally active in assisting the takeover work, with some producing up to four issues a day. The Kuomintang's "National Chengchi University" and the "Jianguo College of Law and Commerce" run by the CC Clique have been dissolved by the Military Control Commission, and all faculty and staff, except for those with notorious reactionary crimes, have been properly settled. The remaining schools have not stopped classes. Two hundred and thirteen public primary and secondary schools, social education organizations, schools for the blind and deaf, etc., have also been inventoried. The remaining personnel and equipment of the three Kuomintang reactionary newspapers, *Central Daily News*, *Heping Daily*, and *Jiuguo Daily*, as well as the reactionary news agencies such as the Central News Agency, the Military News Agency of the Ministry of National Defense, and the Information Office of the Executive Yuan, have been completely dealt with. The store staff of seven reactionary bookstores, including Zhengzhong Book Company, China Cultural Service Society, Bati Bookstore, Hongye Library, Jianguo Bookstore, New China Publishing House, and Duli Publishing House, have joined the Xinhua Bookstore retail department. A sufficient amount of money has been issued to a small number of personnel who are not suitable for the people's publishing industry, and they have been dismissed to return to their hometowns for production or recommended for reemployment. Nine units, including the Nanjing Printing Factory, the Central Printing Bureau, the Southeast Printing Factory of the Pseudo-Ministry of Social Affairs, the Printing Factory of the China Cultural Service Society, the Capital Printing House, the Guomin Printing House, the Guomin Printing Factory, the Second Printing Factory of the Pseudo-Ministry of National Defense, and the Printing Factory of the Pseudo-Combined Logistics Headquarters, have concentrated on starting work in several places due to the relocation of most materials when the Kuomintang fled. At present, each academic institution and school has begun to establish management work groups, and the focus of work has shifted to management, developing business, and learning.
