Editorial Postscript

　　British Imperialism is a "Female Assistant"!
　　At the 14th Congress of the All-Union Communist Party, Stalin said: "The United States is the main country that exploits the world's finances, and Britain has become its female assistant." At present, the British Labour government is playing the role of this "female assistant," vainly hoping to share some of the leftovers of American imperialism in "exploiting the world's finances." The Labour ruling clique even severely suppressed the opinions of left-wing elements at the annual meeting, preventing the passage of resolutions reflecting workers' demands, fully demonstrating the ugly face of a "female assistant." However, the broad masses of British workers and lower-level Labour Party members are indignantly opposing the deception of the "female assistant," showing the strength of the American people themselves.

　　英帝是个“女助手”！
    联共第十四次代表大会上，斯大林曾说过：“美国是剥榨世界财政的主要国家，而英国成了它的女助手。”目前，英国工党政府正在充当着这个“女助手”，妄想在“剥榨世界财政”中分得一些美帝的残羹。工党统治集团竟在年会上严厉压制左翼分子的意见，阻止通过反映工人要求的决议，十足表现了“女助手”的丑态。但，英国的广大工人和工党下层党员都在愤慨地反对“女助手”的欺骗，显示着美国人民自己的力量。
