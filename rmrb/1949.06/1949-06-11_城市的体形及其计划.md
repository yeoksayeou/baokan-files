　　The Shape of Cities and Their Planning
    Liang Sicheng
    It is reported that the Beiping City Urban Planning Committee has been established, and construction work is about to begin. At the very beginning of this work, I would like to put forward some basic principles regarding the urban form plan for a review. I hope that citizens who are concerned about the future development of this city will express their opinions as much as possible to guide and supervise the people responsible for the plan.
    　　　　(1) The Four Major Functions of a City
    The life of a person living in a city can be divided into four activities. First, he needs a home to live in, which must at least meet his basic needs for sleep, rest, diet, raising children, and other physiological aspects. Second, he needs work; whatever his profession, he has a place to work. Third, he needs recreation; no matter who it is, he must have some free time outside of sleeping, eating, and working, and during this free time, he must have adequate space for recreation or rest. Fourth, to achieve the first three activities, he needs transportation; because man is an animal, and animals must move. Moving from one location to another is transportation.
    A city must seek to satisfy the requirements of these four activities. Therefore, the four major functions of a city are: (1) Residence, (2) Work, (3) Recreation, (4) Transportation. These four functions are indispensable.
    　　　　(2) Lessons from the Past
    Since the beginning of industrialization in European and American cities, the capitalist class has only cared about enriching themselves, oppressing and exploiting the working class, and ignoring the welfare of the workers, forming the "slums" of human hell. "Slums" became the source of labor for every factory; with few jobs and many people, the welfare of the workers was never a concern of the capitalist class; because no matter how bad the living conditions were, the workers had to submit to work. Moreover, the capitalist class only cared about the convenience of building factories, ignoring cultural relics and scenery, and depriving the people of places for recreation. The following description by Engels is the most vivid. This was in 1844, when he described the view of the Irk River from Ducie Bridge in Manchester, he said:
    "Below flows, or rather stagnates, the Irk, a narrow, coal-black, foul-smelling stream, full of debris and refuse, which it deposits on the shallower right bank...Besides this, the stream itself is checked every few paces by high weirs, behind which quantities of stagnant filth accumulate and rot. Above the bridge are tanneries, bone mills, and gasworks, from which all drains and refuse find their way into the Irk, which receives further the contents of all the neighbouring sewers and privies. It is, therefore, obvious that the water of this river must be at all times charged with the most revolting filth. To the east of the bridge the left bank rises steeply, forming a high bank covered with buildings, and on the slope are piles of debris, refuse, and offal. In the background are the towering chimneys of factories, the yards of dirty brick buildings, and the rows of wretched dwellings, through the broken windows of which can be seen squalid interiors. The whole picture is one of poverty and desolation."
    More than forty years later, science, technology, medicine, and hygiene had made unprecedented progress, but Engels said this about the so-called "improvement" achievements:
    "The drainage has been increased or improved, and broad roads have been opened through the worst slums I have described...But of what avail? Whole districts which in 1844 were still idyllic have now, with the growth of the town, been given over to poverty, squalor, and misery. Only the pigs and the heaps of refuse have disappeared. The bourgeoisie has made further progress in the art of concealing the misery of the working classes. That there has been no real improvement in the housing of the workers may be seen in the 'Report of the Royal Commission on the Housing of the Poor, 1885'."
    This was still the situation in the 19th century. When automobiles came out, they added another layer of chaos. The streets of the 18th and 19th centuries were designed according to the speed of horse-drawn carriages and pedestrians. Automobiles are not only faster but also more numerous, so the streets of major European and American cities have long been in a state of confusion with congested traffic and frequent accidents. For example, in some parts of London, industry, commerce, and residence are completely mixed together. Among the more than seven million people, one in seven is engaged in transportation; all of his working time and energy is spent transporting the other six people and their products from one location to another. That is a shocking waste of manpower and resources. In Los Angeles, USA, on Broadway, from 1st Street to 10th Street, it used to take only 1 minute and 21 seconds by horse-drawn carriage, but now it takes 14 minutes and 12 seconds by streamlined car. In the United Kingdom and the United States, the annual number of deaths in car accidents is higher than the mortality rate on the battlefield during the same period, and the number of injuries is several times higher than that on the battlefield!
    The result of more than a hundred years of disorderly and unplanned development is that none of the four major functions can be fully developed, but only hinder each other. London, New York, Paris, and many other large cities have become places that are uninhabitable, unsuitable for work, impossible to recreate, and difficult to move around. To correct these malpractices, London and New York are expected to take 50 years and countless manpower and resources. They are lessons from the past!
    In China, large industrial and commercial cities such as Shanghai, Hankou, and Guangzhou have already shown this state. On Nanjing Road in Shanghai, in addition to cars, there are countless tricycles and bicycles, and there is always a threat of death and injury. Lane houses are densely arranged, with each family's front door facing the back door and garbage dump of another family; even the attics in the houses can be divided into two floors for rent. No grass grows in the alleys; in the summer, most of the residents sleep on the ground in the alleys at night. Do residents of big cities have to suffer this kind of abuse? "It is too late to correct the past, but the future can be pursued." From today onwards, every city in China, whether new or old, must be planned and improved to welcome the endless tomorrow.
    　　　　(3) Establishing Fifteen Goals for Urban Form
    In order to ensure the full development of the four major functions, we should move towards the following goals:
    (1) Simple and unpretentious housing suitable for physical and mental health, where people can live in peace, surrounded by refreshing gardens, plenty of sunshine and air, and close to outdoor recreation and play areas.
    (2) The location of primary schools should be within a reasonable and safe walking distance of every home (safe for children to travel to and from school on their own).
    (3) Stores for food and daily necessities should be within a reasonable walking distance of every home. To save the walking distance for buyers and the transportation for vendors, stores in each residential unit should be concentrated in one or several centers. Each center should have safe places and equipment for parking prams and for young children to play.
    (4) Community-based recreational and gathering facilities should also be within walking distance of every home.
    (5) Infants, children, teenagers, youths, and adults should all have appropriate places to play. Children should not be forced to jump and skip stones on the road, and adults should not be forced to lean against telephone poles idly or gamble on the streets.
    (6) Parks should be used for walking and sitting, and should not be too small. They should at least have a sense of natural space.
    (7) The workplace should not be too far from the residence, in order to avoid the waste of time, energy, and money; and to avoid causing traffic congestion on the streets and crowding in vehicles.
    (8) Streets should be designed separately according to their functions, and should be reduced as much as possible. Through-traffic highways, city traffic streets, and boulevards with both intercity traffic and recreational functions all have different uses and require different designs.
    (9) The design relationship between streets and houses should minimize the routes across streets for daily work and recreation; this can be achieved by using neighborhood units (see below) with internal pedestrian walkways.
    (10) All natural advantages—such as scenery, hills, lakes, rivers, and seas—should be preserved and utilized.
    (11) The overall architectural style should be harmonious.
    (12) Large-scale stores, museums, theaters, etc., that are used by and maintained by the majority of people should be located in a central location, with a harmonious architectural style, convenient use, and ample parking space.
    (13) Public buildings need to be built in convenient, central, and aesthetically pleasing locations.
    (14) Traffic to the outside world must be carefully planned. Railways, airports, intercity highways, through-traffic highways, etc., must be in safe and convenient locations, and must be sufficient to meet the needs of transportation volume.
    (15) Minimize the dangers of automobiles—for pedestrians, bicycles, tricycles, car drivers, and passengers. The high number of car accidents in European and American countries is a shameful and unforgivable phenomenon in modern society. Appropriate design can reduce such dangers.
    These fifteen goals are not empty ideals, but are absolutely achievable. In order to enable every city resident to live and work in peace and contentment, to maintain the physical and mental health of every city resident, and to improve the national production and work efficiency, we should strive towards these fifteen goals simultaneously and comprehensively.
    　　　　(4) Four Types of Form Foundation
    In order to achieve these fifteen goals, we should make rational and appropriate deployments of the four major functions in terms of form. The basic principle of deployment is to achieve reasonable isolation and reasonable connection between the four major functions (and even between the different functions that constitute the secondary level of the four major functions). Because of the different functions, isolation is necessary; but there is a connection between all functions, so connection is necessary. How to achieve reasonable isolation and connection is planning.
    In order to make the four major functions obtain the most reasonable isolation and connection, we have absorbed the experience of the Soviet Union, Europe and the United States in the past ten years, and should use four different form foundations: (1) zoning; (2) neighborhood units; (3) ring-radial road network; (4) self-sufficient urban areas with limited population area.
    (1) Zoning is the division of different functions such as residence, industry, commerce, administration, and recreation in the city into appropriate areas.
    (2) The neighborhood unit is the newest basic unit of residential areas, a small unit that can be self-sufficient to a certain extent. Within the neighborhood, there is a neighborhood center, with stores, primary schools, health stations, farmers' markets, entertainment venues, sports fields, children's playgrounds, parks, etc. Through-traffic cars are not allowed to pass through the neighborhood. The radius of the neighborhood does not exceed the walking distance that children can take from home to school. The population and housing density in the neighborhood have certain regulations, so that each family has sufficient air, sunlight, and gardens. Each neighborhood has a reasonable connection with the work area.
    (3) The ring road is a road system that restricts traffic flow, especially through-traffic or passing-through traffic, so that it does not enter the urban area. In a city, major roads that are roughly parallel to the center are divided into three or four rings according to size. Radial routes are used to connect the rings and lead to the innermost ring. The areas within the inner ring and between the rings and radial roads are the districts or neighborhoods. Within each district and neighborhood, there are only streets for vehicles destined for that district. The design of such streets should make it impossible or inconvenient for traffic to use them when passing through the area, then vehicles will naturally gather on the main roads. In this way, the number of vehicles in densely populated or residential areas can be reduced, congestion can be avoided, and traffic accidents can be prevented.
    (4) A limited urban area is an urban area that is not allowed to spread too large. The most ideal maximum is 50,000 to 60,000 people. If this number is exceeded, another area should be built at least three or four kilometers away. Construction of industrial, commercial and residential buildings must be absolutely prohibited between the two districts, and farmland or woodland should be preserved. This scattered distribution allows residents of each district to come into contact with nature without having to travel long distances. If there is unfortunately a risk of air raids, the dispersed targets are much safer than large, concentrated targets.
    　　　　(5) Conclusion
    Whether planning a new city or improving an old city, we should use the above four forms as much as possible, towards the fifteen goals, in order to fully develop the four major functions. The ruts of the past are all over Europe and America. At the beginning of construction, the new China of New Democracy can avoid the mistakes of others from the very first step. This is an opportunity that those who come later should seize.
    Finally, there are three points that should be specifically mentioned:
    (1) Modern means of transportation have shrunk the world. No city can isolate itself anymore. Every city is closely related to neighboring cities and even more distant cities. For example, planning Beiping, Tianjin, Tangshan, Zhangjiakou, and Shijiazhuang are all related to Beiping. Problems such as Tangshan's coal and Tianjin's import and export trade can all affect Beiping's plan. Therefore, when planning a city, the geographical, social, and economic conditions of neighboring cities and villages must be coordinated with the city. This is to follow Chairman Mao's policy of promoting in all directions, which I don’t need to elaborate on here.
    (2) A city is the physical space of all urban activities. If the physical form is not suitable for the way of activities, then everything will be chaotic. Therefore, before planning the physical form, there must be accurate surveys and statistics on the city's population, industry, commerce, and all social phenomena. These are specialized issues in various fields. People who make physical form plans must first obtain data from various experts before they can start. Therefore, although the physical form of a city is the work of physical form planners, the formation of the physical form requires the leadership of all aspects, all experts, and all citizens.
    (3) After each city plan is established, all construction must be carried out in accordance with the plan, and no public or private buildings may conflict with the plan. The government must supervise the strict implementation of the plan. But at the same time, what must be taken into account is that human lifestyles are always changing, so every three to five years, the future must be predicted according to the development situation, and the plan must be reviewed again, and modified when necessary, in order to be practical and achieve the greatest effect.
    The above discussion is only the basic principles of urban form planning. As for how to apply it to our Beiping city, I will have the opportunity to bring it up again for advice.

### 城市的体形及其计划

　　城市的体形及其计划
    梁思成
    报载北平市都市计划委员会已经成立，建设工作即将展开。在工作刚刚开始的时候，谨将若干关于城市体形计划的基本原则，先提出来作一次检讨，希望关心本市将来发展的市民尽量发表高见，去领导督促负责计划的人。
    　　　　（一）城市的四大功能
    在一个城市里住的人，他的生活可分为四种活动。第一，他需要一个居住的家，这个家至少须能满足他睡眠，休息，饮食，养育儿女，及其他生理方面的基本要求。第二，他需要工作；无论他的职业是什么，他都有工作的地方。第三，他需要游息；无论何人在睡眠饮食与工作之外，他必有多多少少的空闲时间，这些空闲时间之内，他须有适当的游玩或休息的空间。第四，为达到前三项活动，他需要交通；因为人是一个动物，动物是必须动的。由一个地点动到另一个地点便是交通。
    一个城市必须求其可以满足这四种活动的要求。所以城市的四大功能就是：（１）居住，（２）工作，（３）游息，（４）交通。这四个功能是缺一不可的。
    　　　　（二）前车之鉴
    欧美的城市自从开始工业化以来，资本阶级只顾自肥，压迫剥削工人阶级，不顾工人福利，型成了人间地狱的“贫民窟”。“贫民窟”成了每一个工厂劳工的来源；工少人多，工人的福利绝不是资本阶级所关心的；因为无论住处如何恶劣，工人总须屈服来工作的。并且资本阶级只顾自己建厂的方便，不顾文物，不顾风景，剥削了人民游息的地方。下面恩格斯的一段叙述，最为逼真。这是一八四四年，他描写从曼彻斯达市都西桥上所望见的伊尔克河景色，他说：
    “下面流着的，不如说淤滞着的，是伊尔克河，一带狭小、漆黑、臭不可当的小溪，满是秽土垃圾，被溪流冲积在较浅的右岸边。……除此而外，溪流的本身每隔几步就被很高的埂堰一道一道的拦阻起来，堰后堆积了大堆的黏浆垃圾，在那里腐烂。桥的上游是许多的制革厂，将邻近空气中充满了动物体腐朽的臭味，还有制骨厂和煤气厂，把所有的秽水废料，都冲到伊尔克河里；此外附近所有的下水道和便粪也都流入这小河里来。向桥的下游看见的是陡峻的左岸上无数住户中丢出来的残砖断瓦，垃圾秽物。在这陡峻的山坡上，每一所房屋都紧挤在它的邻舍的背后，每一所都露出一小部分，全是漆黑、烟熏、破烂、陈旧的房子，窗格和玻璃都是破碎的。……后面的背景是营房一般的工厂建筑……围着贫民义地和铁路车站；车站后面就是曼彻斯达监狱，如同一座堡垒，从山顶高耸的危墙和垛堞上，威胁的俯视着下面的工人住宅区。”
    四十多年以后，科学、技术、医药卫生等等方面都有了史无前例的大进步，但是恩格斯对于所谓“改善”成绩却如此说：
    “排水设备增建了，或是改善了，在我所描写过最恶劣的贫民窟间开出来宏敞的大马路了。……不过，那便何如？有许多整个的地区，在一八四四年还是富有田园诗趣的，因为市区的扩大，现在也沦落到破烂、不舒适、苦恼的境界了。只有猪群和大堆垃圾已不存在。布尔乔亚阶级在藏匿工人苦况的技术上又进了一步。对于工人居住之没有实际改善，在一八八五年的‘皇家贫民住宅委员会报告’里就可以充分看出来。”
    这还是十九世纪的情况，等到汽车出来，便更加上一重混乱的因素。十八九世纪的街道是按马车和步行人的速度而分划出来的。汽车不惟速度高，而且数量多，所以欧美大城市的街道早已呈现车辆拥挤，车祸频仍的混乱状态。例如伦敦若干部分，工业商业住宅完全混杂在一起。七百余万人口之中，每七人中有一人以运输为业；他全部的工作时间精力就以将其余六人及其产品从一地点输送到另一地点。那是惊人的人力物力的浪费。美国洛杉机市，在百老汇大马路上，从第一街至第十街，当年坐马车只需十分二十一秒的时间，现在的流线型汽车却需十四分十二秒。在英国和美国，每年的车祸死亡数字比同期间战场死亡率还高，而受伤数字则比战场高出几倍！
    百余年来无秩序无计划发展的结果，使得四大功能无一能充分发展，只互相妨碍。伦敦、纽约、巴黎，以及许多的大都市已成了不可居住、不宜工作、不能游息、不得行动的地方。为矫正这些弊病，伦敦、纽约都预计需要五十年的时间，计不清的人力物力。它们是我们前车之鉴！
    在中国，上海、汉口、广州等大工商都市已呈现了这种状态。上海南京路上的车辆，汽车之外再参杂上无数三轮车、自行车，随时随地都潜伏着死伤的威胁。弄堂房子密密的排列，每家的大门面对着别人的后门和垃圾堆；房子里连亭子间都可搭成两层分租。弄堂里寸草不生；到了夏季夜间大多数的住户都睡在弄堂地上。大城市的居民，是否必须受这种虐待？“以往不谏，来者可追”，从今日起，中国的每一个城市，无论新旧，都必须计划和改善，以迎接无尽的明天。
    　　　　（三）建立城市体形的十五个目标
    为求四大功能之得到充分发展，我们应向下列目标迈进：
    （１）适宜于身心健康，使人可以安居的简单朴素的住宅，周围有舒爽的园地，充足的阳光和空气，接近户外休息和游戏的地方。
    （２）小学的位置，在距离每一所住宅都适当而安全（儿童自己来回的安全）的步程之内。
    （３）食品和日常用品的商店距离每一所住宅都在适当步程之内，为的节省购买人的步程和商贩的运送，每一个住宅区单位中的商店应该集中在一个或几个中心，每个中心都应有可以停放摇篮车和可以供幼童游戏的安全地方与设备。
    （４）社区性的娱乐与集合设备，也在每一所住宅步程之内。
    （５）幼童、儿童、少年、青年、成人都应有适当的游戏地方，不应逼着儿童在马路上跳蹦，打石子，成年也不应逼使在路旁倚着电杆无聊，或在街旁赌博。
    （６）公园须可供散步坐息之用，并且不宜太小，至少须有在自然的空间的感觉。
    （７）工作地距离住宅不宜太远，以避免时间、精力、金钱的耗费；避免造成街上车辆之拥挤和车内乘客之拥挤。
    （８）街道按功用分别设计，并须极力减少。过境车流大道，市内交通街道，以及兼有市际交通和游息性双层功用的林荫大道，都各有不同的用途，须有不同的设计。
    （９）街道与房屋的设计关系，应使每日的工作与游息都将横过街道的路线，减至最低度；若用邻里单位（详下文），内部有步行道，可以达此目地。
    （１０）一切自然的优点——如风景、山冈、湖沼、河海等等——都应保存而利用。
    （１１）全部建筑式样应和谐。
    （１２）大规模的商店、博物馆、剧场等等，供多数人的需用，且需多数人维持的，须位置适中，建筑式样和谐，使用方便，且须有充分的停车地。
    （１３）公共建筑需要建立在方便适中并且观瞻壮美的位置上。
    （１４）与外界的交通须慎密计划，铁路，飞机场，市际公路，过境公路等等，须在安全而方便的位置上，而且须足供运输量的需求。
    （１５）尽可能的减少汽车的危险性——对于行路人、自行车、三轮车、汽车司机和乘客的危险性。欧美各国车祸之多是近代社会中一个可耻而不可饶恕的现象。适当的设计是可以减低这类危险性的。
    这十五个目标并不是空洞的理想，而是绝对可以实现的。为使每一个城市居民可以安居乐业，为保持每一个城市居民身心双方面的健康，为提高全国的生产工作效率，我们应该向这十五个目标同时全面努力。
    　　　　（四）四种体形基础
    为达到这十五个目标，我们应将四大功能，从体形方面作合理适当的布署。布署的基本原则在使四大功能之间（乃至构成四大功能的次一层不同的功能之间），得到合理的隔离，合理的联系。因功能之不同所以须隔离；但一切功能之间都有联带性，所以须联系。如何取得合理的隔离与联系就是计划。
    为求使四大功能得到最合理的隔离与联系，我们吸收近十年来苏联欧美的经验，应当用四种不同的体形基础：（１）分区；（２）邻里单位；（３）环形辐射道路网；（４）人口面积有限度的自给自足市区。
    （１）分区是将市内居住、工业、商业、行政、游息等等不同的功能，分划在适当的地区上。
    （２）邻里单位是最新的住宅区基本单位，是一个在某种限度之下能自给自足的小单位。邻里之内有一个邻里中心，设置商店、小学校、卫生站、菜市场、娱乐场、运动场、儿童游戏场、公园等等。邻里之内不许过境汽车穿过。邻里的半径不超过儿童可以由家到学校的步程。邻里内的人口与房屋密度有一定的规定，使每家都有充分的空气、阳光、庭园。每个邻里都与工作区有合理的联系。
    （３）环形路是拘束车流，尤其是过境或穿过的车流使它不入市区的道路系统。在一个市内，按大小划出三环或四环约略同中心而平行的干道，用辐射形路线将各环衔接而通到最内一环，内环之内以及各环与辐射路之间的地区便是各区或邻里。在各区及邻里之内都只有以本区为目的地车辆的街道。这种街道之设计应使车流不能或不便作穿过本区时的使用，则车辆自然会集在干道上行驶。如此则可减少人烟稠密或住宅地区内车辆数目，免去拥挤，弥防车祸。
    （４）有限度的市区是不许蔓延过大的市区。最理想的以五六万人为最大限度。超过此数就应在至少三四公里距离之外，另建一区。两区之间必须绝对禁止建造工商住宅建筑，保留着农田或林地。这种疏散的分布，可使每区居民，不必长途跋涉，即可与大自然接触。若不幸而有空袭的危险，则分散的目标比广大集中的目标的安全性也大得多。
    　　　　（五）结论
    无论计划一个新城市或改善一个旧城市，都应该尽可能的用上述四种体形，向着十五个目标，以求四大功能之充分发展。前车之辙布满了全欧美，新民主主义的新中国在建设开始的时候，可以从第一步就不蹈人家的覆辙，这是后来居上者所应把握住的机会。
    最后还有三点应该特别提出：
    （１）现代交通工具已将世界缩小了。没有一个城市能再孤立的独善其身。每一个城市与邻近的城市，乃至更远的城市，都是息息相关的。例如计划北平、天津、唐山、张家口、石家庄都与北平有关系。如唐山的煤，天津的进出口贸易等等的问题，都可影响到北平的计划。所以计划一个城市，邻近城市乡村的地理、社会、经济情形，必须使与本城配合。这就是遵从毛主席的四面八方政策推进，不必我在此赘说了。
    （２）一座城市是城市一切活动的体形空间，若是体形不适宜于活动方式，则一切必紊乱。所以在计划体形之前，必须对于城市人口，工商业，以及一切社会现象都应有精确的调查统计。这是各方面的专门问题，做体形计划的人必须先得到各专家的资料才能着手的。所以城市的体形虽是做体形计划者的工作，但是体形之型成却是要各方面各专家，全体市民出来领导的。
    （３）每个城市计划订定之后，一切建设都必须遵守计划进行，无论任何公私建筑都不得与计划相抵触。政府须督促计划之严格施行。但同时不能不顾到的，就是人类生活方式是永远在转变的，所以每隔三年五年必须按发展情形推测将来，将计划重新检讨，必要时加以修改，以求切合实际，方能收到最大效果。
    以上所论只是城市体形计划的基本原则，至于如何应用到我们的北平市上，有机会当再提出来请教。
