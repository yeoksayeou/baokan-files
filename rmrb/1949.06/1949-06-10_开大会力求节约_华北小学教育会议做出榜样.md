　　Making Great Efforts to Save Money at Meetings
  　North China Primary Education Conference Sets an Example
    [Our Newspaper's Report] The North China People's Government's Ministry of Education recently held a primary education conference, which serves as an example of saving money during meetings. Because the principle of not being extravagant or wasteful was adhered to, even though the conference was extended by five days, it still saved one-third of the meeting's budgeted expenses. Before the meeting, the conference's budget was created according to the principle of frugality. During the actual expenses, attention was paid to saving money. The comrades responsible for general affairs and liaison work, whether in housing, meals, or purchases, followed the experience of "comparing three shops before buying" and carefully investigated and calculated in many ways. For example, in terms of accommodation, the hotels selected were both good and cheap. In terms of meals, the packaged meals in the restaurant were also cheaper than usual. Even boiling water was two-thirds cheaper because they went a little further to get it. Watching plays and movies during conference breaks was done as much as possible in conjunction with the agency's evening events. On the one hand, the needs of work and life were taken care of, which satisfied everyone. On the other hand, money was also saved.

　　开大会力求节约
  　华北小学教育会议做出榜样
    【本报讯】一个开大会的节约榜样，华北人民政府教育部于最近召开的小学教育会议由于掌握了不铺张不浪费的节约原则，会议日期虽延长五天，但仍节省会议费预算的三分之一。会前即根据节约原则制定大会经费预算，在实际开支中，再注意节约，负责总务与联络工作的同志无论在住房、吃饭、购置等问题上，均根据“货走三家不上当”的经验，多方调查，精心计算。如住的方面，选择的旅馆又好又便宜。吃饭方面，在饭馆里包饭，也较一般便宜。连烧开水，也因多跑了一点路，就便宜三分之二。会议空隙中看戏看电影，尽量与机关晚会相结合。一方面照顾了工作与生活的需要，使大家都满意，另一方面也省了钱。
