　　Ping Municipality Industrial Association
  　Hosts Shandong Visiting Delegation
    [This newspaper's dispatch] Yesterday (the 17th) at 2 PM, the Ping Municipality Industrial Association hosted the Shandong Visiting Delegation at Shanglin Spring in Zhongshan Park. More than ten representatives were present, including representatives from the Shandong Provincial Government, the Jinan Industry and Commerce Bureau, and the Chamber of Commerce. The Shandong Visiting Delegation expressed satisfaction with the industrial exhibition, saying, "In the future, Jinan will also hold such exhibitions to promote the development of industrial production; and we hope that the Ping Municipality Industrial Association will introduce more of its experience in organizing industrial exhibitions." The director of the Jinan Municipal Industry and Commerce Bureau said, "After visiting the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant, I feel that the connection between the two cities in the past was too poor. The Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant was afraid that there would be no market for 'water pipes' and dared not produce them in large quantities, while many mines in Shandong lacked water pipes and went everywhere to buy them but could not." Both sides decided to strengthen the connection between the two cities in the future, exchange information, and smooth the flow of materials in order to build a new Beijing and a new Jinan for the people.

　　平市工业会
  　招待山东参观团
    【本报讯】昨（十七）日下午二时，平市工业会假中山公园上林春招待山东参观团，到山东省府代表、济南工商局、商会等代表十余人。山东参观团对工展表示满意，说：“将来，济南也要举行这样的展览会，以促进工业生产的发展；并希望平市工业会多多介绍组织工展的经验”。济南市工商局长说：“参观石景山钢铁厂后，感觉过去两市联系太差了：石景山钢铁厂怕‘水管’没有销路，不敢大量生产，山东好多矿厂缺少水管，到处去买买不来。”双方决定加强今后两市的联系，互通有无，顺畅物资交流，以建设人民的新北平、新济南。
