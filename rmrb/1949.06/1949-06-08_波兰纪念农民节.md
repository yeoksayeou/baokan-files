Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, July 7th: Warsaw dispatch: June 5th was Farmers' Day in Poland. This year, Polish farmers commemorated their holiday under the slogans of striving for peace, opposing the American and British war-mongers, consolidating the worker-peasant alliance, and implementing the merger of the two peasant parties. In order to welcome the festival, the farmers launched a production competition. The "People's Voice," the organ of the Polish United Workers' Party, wrote: "No force can destroy the worker-peasant alliance, which is the solid foundation for People's Poland to move towards socialism."

Since the liberation of Poland, the lives of Polish farmers have undergone tremendous changes. After the landlord class was eliminated, the rich peasants, the remnants of other exploiting classes, and right-wing opportunists opposed the organization of agricultural producers' cooperatives. The poor and middle peasants have mercilessly exposed this hostile behavior. In the increasingly tense class struggle, agricultural producers' cooperatives were finally organized on a completely voluntary basis. The farmers participating in the fifty agricultural producers' cooperatives collectively cultivated about 10,000 hectares (more than 160,000 Chinese acres) of land for the first time this spring. According to the Soviet writer Makarenko, who visited the Polish countryside: These agricultural producers' cooperatives will become model farms and become examples for individual farmers, opening up a brilliant path to socialism for Polish farmers.

　　波兰纪念农民节
    【新华社北平七日电】华沙讯：六月五日是波兰的农民节。今年波兰农民是在争取和平，反对美英战争贩子，巩固工农联盟，把两个农民政党实行合并的口号之下纪念自己的节日的。农民们为迎接节日，曾发动生产竞赛，波兰统一工人党机关报“人民言论报”著文称：“没有任何力量能够破坏工农联盟，它是人民波兰走向社会主义的巩固基础。”
    波兰农民生活自波兰解放以来，已发生巨大变化。在地主阶级消灭了以后，富农、其他剥削阶级的残余和右翼机会主义者都反对组织农业生产合作社，贫农和中农对这种敌对行为已予以无情揭露，在日益紧张的阶级斗争中，农业生产合作社终于在完全自愿的基础上组织起来了。参加五十个农业生产合作社的农民，今春第一次集体耕种了约一万公顷（合十六万多华亩）土地。据曾访问波兰农村的苏联作家马卡林柯说：这种农业生产合作社将变成模范农场，成为个体农民的榜样。给波兰农民展开了走向社会主义的光辉灿烂的道路。
