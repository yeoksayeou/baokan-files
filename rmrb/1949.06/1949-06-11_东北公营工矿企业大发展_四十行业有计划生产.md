Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 10th. Publicly owned industrial and mining enterprises in the provinces, cities, and counties of Northeast China have begun to take shape and are now undergoing more planned development to cooperate with stronger state-owned enterprises in large-scale economic construction. According to incomplete statistics, there are 1,755 publicly owned industrial and mining enterprises in Northeast China's provinces, cities, and counties, including more than forty industries such as mines, ironworks, textiles, sawmills, matches, needles, papermaking, printing, leather, clothing, flax, fur, chemicals, electrical materials, pharmaceuticals, cement, and kilns. These enterprises employ more than 42,400 workers and have more than 25,300 machines and lathes of various types. Among them, there are 23 provincial-run mines, including coal, gold, clay, arsenic, and asbestos mines, employing more than 12,000 workers. Textile industry is second, with more than 4,290 power looms and more than 3,300 workers. Other industries such as ironworks, sawmills, grain and rice processing, and leather each employ 1,600 to 1,800 workers. The Local Industry Department of the Northeast Administrative Committee is responsible for the unified leadership of the above-mentioned industries. Industrial bureaus and industrial sections have also been established in various provinces and counties, while industrial bureaus or industry and commerce bureaus have been established in cities such as Shenyang, Harbin, and Changchun. At present, local publicly owned industrial and mining enterprises have formulated their production plans for this year, initially implemented economic accounting, and established various systems, beginning to overcome blindness in production and embark on the road of planned production. According to the production plans set by various industries for this year, the 12 provincial-run coal mines plan to produce 1.5 million tons of coal this year. Some larger-scale enterprises, such as the Andong Guanghua Textile Factory, plan to produce 280,000 bolts of cloth annually, the Songgen Oil Factory in Songjiang Province plans to produce 2.13 million catties of light and heavy oil, and the Nenjiang Iron Factory in Heilongjiang Province plans to manufacture 1,850 small machines such as seeders.

During the puppet Manchukuo period, most of the local publicly owned industrial and mining enterprises in Northeast China were operated by Japanese invaders. After August 15th, they were severely damaged by the Japanese invaders and the Kuomintang bandits, and real estate and machinery were almost completely lost. Therefore, the restoration work was quite arduous. For example, in the Shuangyashan Coal Mine in Songjiang Province, all equipment was completely destroyed, and all mechanical equipment was reinstalled. It can now produce 400,000 tons of coal annually. State-owned enterprises have also strongly supported the restoration and construction of local publicly owned enterprises. For example, in addition to the 5 billion yuan invested by Liaodong Province in the Guanghua Asbestos Factory, the Industry Department of the Northeast Administrative Committee provided advance payments of more than 10 billion yuan in the form of orders. Local publicly owned enterprises have also received great assistance from state-owned enterprises in terms of marketing, equipment, raw materials, and technology.

　　东北公营工矿企业大发展
  　四十行业有计划生产
    【新华社沈阳十日电】东北各省市、县公营的工矿企业已初具规模，现正作更有计划的发展，以配合更强有力的国营企业，从事大规模的经济建设。据现有不完全统计，东北各省、市、县共有工矿企业一千七百五十五个单位，包括矿山、铁工、纺织、制材、火柴、制针、造纸、印刷、皮革、被服、亚麻、毛皮、化学、电料、制药、洋灰、窑业等四十余种行业，有职工四万二千四百余人，有各种机器及车床二万五千三百余台。其中省营矿山有煤、金、粘土、砷、石绵等矿二十三个，职工一万二千余人。其次为纺织业，有电力织布机四千二百九十余台，职工三千三百余人。其他如铁工、制材、粮米加工、皮革等业，各有职工一千六百至一千八百不等。对上述各业的领导，统一由东北行政委员会工业部的地方工业处负责。在各省县也设立有工业厅和工业科，沈阳、哈尔滨、长春等市，则设有工业局或工商局。目前各地方公营工矿企业单位已制定了今年的生产计划，初步实行了经济核算和建立起各种制度，开始克服生产中的盲目性，走上有计划生产的道路。根据各业订定的今年度生产计划，今年十二个省营煤矿计划产煤一百五十万吨。一些规模较大的企业，如安东光华纺织厂计划年产布二十八万匹，松江省的松根油厂计划生产轻重油二百十三万斤，黑龙江省嫩江铁工厂计划制造播种等小型机器一千八百五十台。
    东北地方公营工矿企业，在伪满时大部为日寇经营，“八一五”后，经日寇及国民党匪帮先后严重破坏，房产及机器损失殆尽。因此恢复工作相当艰巨。如松江省双鸭山煤矿，一切设备均被破坏净尽，全部机械设备都是重新按装的，现已可年产煤四十万吨。国营企业对于地方公营企业的恢复建设，亦大力予以扶助。如辽东光华石绵厂除由本省投资五十亿元外，并得到东北政委会工业部以订货方式先期付款一百余亿元。地方公营企业在推销、器材、原料、技术等方面亦得到国营企业很大帮助。
