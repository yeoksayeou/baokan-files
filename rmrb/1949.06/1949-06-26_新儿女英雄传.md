  　Chapter Fourteen: The Puzzle of Marriage
  　The more I think about it, the sweeter it gets, like sugar, drool dripping down my chin.
    ——Li Ji's poem
    I.
    Niu Dashui returned to Dayang Village, and the comrades had all returned as well. Suddenly, many villages were liberated, and everyone was very happy. A day later, the village chiefs were indeed released. Everyone held another meeting to discuss the Party's instructions: on the one hand, we must utilize upper-level relationships, but mainly we must organize the lower-level masses and expand our strength. The comrades set off again; Niu Dashui went to Shen Family Village again to secretly mobilize the masses and restore various organizations...

    But He Goupi led a bunch of special agents, and he was terribly wicked; this noseless evil dog was still sticking his head out, going everywhere, sniffing everywhere. One day, he even sent someone to trick Gao Tun'er's mother back home, set a fire in the middle of the night, and burned her alive; the corpse was burned and shriveled up, turning into a lump of black charcoal.

    Niu Dashui hurried back to report. Hei Laocai said angrily: "We must be lenient on the one hand and suppressive on the other; we will never be polite to bad eggs like He Goupi!" Everyone shouted: "We must tear this dog skin apart!" Gao Tun'er was even more pounding his chest and stamping his feet, crying and wanting to take revenge. Hei Laocai discussed it with everyone and decided to send Dashui and Gao Tun'er to seize the opportunity to take out He Goupi and execute him, in order to warn other die-hard traitors.

    One night, Dashui and Gao Tun'er arrived at Shen Family Village and found out that He Goupi was indulging himself in the "Korean" opened white flour restaurant. They sneaked into the white flour restaurant, climbing over the wall. One of the guards accompanying He Goupi was asleep in the west room. He Goupi and Li Liuzi were smoking opium on the kang in the north room, and the Korean was sitting beside them, making dumplings. Dashui and Gao Tun'er burst in with guns. He Goupi was caught off guard and was immediately grabbed by the hair by Gao Tun'er and dragged off the kang. Dashui raised his gun and said, "Whoever shouts will be shot dead!" Li Liuzi and the Korean were so scared that they didn't dare to move. Dashui took all the guns from He Goupi and Li Liuzi.

    Gao Tun'er tied up He Goupi, turned his face and said: "Ha, Li Liuzi, you've become a traitor again!" He casually tied him and the Korean up as well, stuffing cotton in their mouths. The noseless He Goupi, looking at Dashui and Gao Tun'er, was scared silly, his two sneaky eyes following Dashui and Gao Tun'er. Niu Dashui went to the west room again, took the guard's gun, brought him to the north room, stuffed cotton in his mouth, and tied him up.

    Dashui and Gao Tun'er secretly discussed and decided to take Li Liuzi out as well, using the opportunity of executing He Goupi to re-educate him. After discussing it, Dashui said to the guard and the Korean: "It's none of your business, you just stay here obediently!" He left the two of them behind, locked the door from the outside, and took He Goupi and Li Liuzi away.

    Gao Tun'er escorted He Goupi, Niu Dashui escorted Li Liuzi, and they quietly walked out of the village. These two traitors were not tied up tightly, but with their own waistbands; Dashui and the two of them held onto the ends of the belts. As soon as they left the village, He Goupi, thinking about the bad things he had done, knew things were not looking good. Taking advantage of Gao Tun'er's inattention, he suddenly struggled, and the end of the belt slipped out of Gao Tun'er's hand. He Goupi took off running, startling Gao Tun'er who gave chase. Dashui anxiously shouted to Tun'er: "Why don't you shoot?" Gao Tun'er hurriedly fired a shot, but missed. Dashui was focused on that end, not expecting that Li Liuzi, whom he was holding, also struggled and broke free from the belt, running east. Dashui fired a shot backhand, and Li Liuzi fell to the ground with a thud. Dashui hurriedly ran over to see, and he had just hit the mark. The bullet entered from the back of the head and shot out from the forehead; there was a pool of blood on the ground, and blood bubbles were still popping on the head.

    Gao Tun'er chased for a while, but didn't catch up. He walked back, hitting his own head, and said angrily: "I deserve to die! I watched him run away, damn it!" Saying that, this tall young man squatted down and cried. Dashui walked over dejectedly and said: "Alas, this is bad! Li Liuzi also ran, and in my haste, I shot him dead. What a damn shame! The one who should have been shot wasn't shot, but the one who shouldn't have been shot was shot! What to do?"

    Just then, the machine gun on the village east blockhouse opened fire, bullets flying straight toward them. They didn't dare to delay any longer and hurried back.

    II.
    Back at the organization, both of them were criticized. He Goupi didn't dare to stay in Shen Family Village anymore, and went to his father's place in town, lying in bed for several days, unable to get up.

    Soon, the Japanese soldiers in the blockhouse of Shen Family Village, afraid they couldn't deal with the Eighth Route Army, all withdrew to the town; only the puppet army was left here to guard. Guo San Mazi was even more frightened and feigned illness to recuperate in the town. Hei Laocai and the others took this opportunity to write a warning letter to the blockhouse and posted anti-Japanese and national salvation propaganda all over the streets. Slogans welcoming the puppet army to revolt were posted all the way to the blockhouse.

    One evening, Hei Laocai and Niu Dashui were talking about something at Shen Yaozong's house when they suddenly heard footsteps. Looking through the glass window, they saw three puppet soldiers carrying guns walking into the courtyard. Shen Yaozong's face changed, and he stood up in panic and said: "Quick! Hide in the suite!" Laocai calmly said: "It doesn't matter, I'll deal with them!" He tucked the small pistol in his sleeve, threw the Mauser pistol on the kang, pretending not to be prepared; he also whispered a few words to Dashui. The three puppet soldiers lifted the door curtain and came in. As soon as the puppet soldiers came in, they saw a black-bearded man with sideburns sitting on the kang, dressed in plain clothes, his eyes shining brightly as he sized them up; next to him sat a coarse-browed, big-eyed peasant; the village head Shen Yaozong stood aside, looking very uneasy. The puppet soldiers were very surprised, and in the blink of an eye, they saw a Mauser pistol on the kang; they guessed that the two must be Eighth Route Army soldiers, and they panicked for a moment, immediately wanting to retreat. But the peasant called out to them: "Don't go! Our battalion commander has something to say to you."

    When the three puppet soldiers heard that it was the battalion commander, they were even more frightened and hurriedly stood at attention, bowing in unison and saying: "What are your orders, Battalion Commander?" Hei Laocai asked with a frown: "What are you running around for so late?" His voice was very loud, and the three puppet soldiers turned pale, respectfully standing with their hands down and answering: "Yes, Battalion Commander! We just wanted to find some tobacco to satisfy our cravings, nothing else." Hei Laocai said: "Sit down!" The puppet soldiers said: "Commander is above us, let us stand for a while." Laocai said: "It doesn't matter, we are all Chinese, sit down and talk."

    The puppet soldiers sat on the large cabinet against the wall, leaning their guns beside them. A squad leader who looked like a smoker took out a pack of cigarettes and handed it over: "Battalion Commander, please have one!" Laocai said that he didn't smoke, so he offered it to Niu Dashui. Dashui said: "I don't smoke that, how can Eighth Route Army soldiers get used to smoking cigarettes!" As he said that, he took out his small pipe and smoked dry tobacco.

    The squad leader hit a snag and had to hand a cigarette to Shen Yaozong; he didn't dare to smoke himself, feigning ignorance and putting the cigarette pack in his pocket. They saw the black-bearded man raise his eyebrows and say: "I have an instruction for you!" The puppet soldiers saw that his face was very serious, felt that the situation was not good, and quickly stood up, their legs shaking, and said: "Battalion Commander, whatever instructions you have, we will definitely follow them." The battalion commander said: "First, you are not allowed to run around for no reason!" "Yes, Battalion Commander!" "Second, you are not allowed to extort the people!" "Yes, Battalion Commander!" "Third, don't carry guns casually when you go out, and if you carry guns, you have to carry them on your backs!" "Yes, Battalion Commander!" "Also, if you have anything, look for the village chief; don't go around knocking on the doors of ordinary people; the people haven't experienced anything, how can they withstand your scare? Do you think that's right?" "Yes, yes, yes, Battalion Commander!"

    Niu Dashui coughed and also raised his eyebrows, saying: "I also have an instruction for you! Don't just think about eating white flour; these days, where do the people get so much white flour for you to eat? Do you think that's right?" The puppet soldiers all nodded, saying: "Yes, yes, yes! Right, right, right!"

    Hei Laocai said kindly: "You don't have to be so polite. We are all Chinese, fellow villagers. Look, we have put our weapons on the kang, we don't regard you as enemies. What we have talked about today, you must earnestly do, and we will often come to check. You must remember that!" They said: "We have all remembered it, Battalion Commander!" The squad leader also said: "We will definitely advance in accordance with your instructions!" Hei Laocai said: "Alright, you can go back now. We'll see how you perform in the future." They said: "Yes, Battalion Commander! Look in the future, anyway, we know everything you do."

    Carrying their guns, they bowed together and were about to leave. Shen Yaozong hurriedly took two steps forward, deliberately showing his loyalty and saying: "Squad Leader Li, I won't see you off. Today, two Eighth Route Army comrades came to educate me, and they also educated you a bit, which is really a coincidence—not a coincidence! Hahaha!" The squad leader said: "Indeed, these two comrades have really enlightened us. This is more satisfying than smoking a pipe of opium!" Saying that, the three of them respectfully withdrew.

    After they had gone far, Laocai and the others took out their pistols from their sleeves and couldn't help but laugh out loud, saying: "That's really interesting! They came to our door, asking us to give them a lesson!"

　　新儿女英雄传
    袁静　孔厥
  　第十四回　结婚的谜
  　越想越甜赛沙糖，涎水流在下巴上。
    ——李季的诗
    一
    牛大水回到大杨庄，同志们也都回来了。一下突开了好些个村子，大伙儿都很欢喜。过了一天，保长们果然放了回来。大家又开会，讨论党的指示：一方面要利用上层关系，主要还是要组织下层群众，扩大我们的力量。同志们又都出发；牛大水再到申家庄去，暗里发动群众，恢复各种组织……。
    可是何狗皮领着一把子特务，邪得厉害；这没有了鼻子的恶狗，还伸着头儿，到处走，到处嗅。有一天，他还打发人，把高屯儿老娘骗回家去，半夜里放火，活活把她烧死；尸首烧得卷缩起来，成一疙瘩黑炭了。
    牛大水赶回来报告。黑老蔡气愤愤的说：“咱们一方面宽大，一方面还得镇压；对何狗皮这样的坏蛋，决不客气！”大伙儿都嚷：“非撕了这狗皮不行！”高屯儿更是捶胸顿脚的哭着，要去报仇。黑老蔡跟大伙儿商量了一下，就决定大水高屯儿两个去，瞅机会掏出何狗皮，执行了他，好警戒旁的铁杆汉奸。
    这一天夜里，大水高屯儿到了申家庄，探听到何狗皮在“高丽棒子”开的白面馆里过瘾呢。他两个摸到白面馆，翻墙进去。何狗皮带的一个护兵在西屋里睡着了。何狗皮和李六子在北屋炕上抽料面，高丽棒子坐在旁边，正在给他们捏馄饨。大水高屯儿端着枪闯进去。何狗皮不提防，一下就给高屯儿抓住了“分头”，拖下炕来。大水平举着枪说：“谁嚷打死谁！”李六子和高丽棒子都吓得不敢动。大水把何狗皮李六子的枪都收了。
    高屯儿捆好何狗皮，转过脸来说：“吓，李六子，你又当起汉奸来啦！”随手把他和高丽棒子也捆了，三个人嘴里都给塞了棉花。没有鼻子的何狗皮，看着大水高屯儿，早吓傻了，两只贼溜溜的眼珠子跟着大水高屯儿转。牛大水又到西屋，把护兵的枪提了，带他到北屋，嘴里也塞了棉花，捆起来。
    大水高屯儿暗暗商量，决定把李六子也带出去，借着执行何狗皮的机会，再教育教育他。商量好了，大水对护兵和高丽棒子说：“没你们的事儿，你们老老实实的在这儿待着！”就留下他俩，从外面扣上门，把何狗皮两个带走了。
    高屯儿押着何狗皮，牛大水押着李六子，悄悄儿往村外走。这两个汉奸都没有五花大绑，是用他们自己的外腰带捆着手的；大水他俩攒往带子头儿。一出村，那何狗皮想着自己干的坏事儿，早知道不好，他趁高屯儿不注意，猛的一挣歪，带子头从高屯儿的手里滑出去了，何狗皮撒开丫子就跑，慌得高屯儿就追。大水着急的喊屯儿：“你怎么不打？”高屯儿慌忙打了一枪，可没打中。大水尽顾着那一头，没想到手里牵着的李六子，一使劲儿，也挣脱了带子往东跑。大水回手就是一枪，李六子扑通倒下了。大水急忙跑去看，刚打了个准，子弹从后脑打进，前额颅射出；地上一滩血，脑瓜儿上还噗噗噗的冒血泡呢。
    高屯儿追了一阵，没追上，走回来打着自己的头，气呼呼的说：“我真该死！眼看着给他妈的跑了！”说着，这高个儿的年轻人，蹲下来就哭。大水垂头丧气的走过来，说：“唉，这事儿可坏了！李六子也跑，我一着忙，就把他打死了。真他妈的倒霉！该打死的没打死，不该打死的倒打死啦！这可怎么办？”
    正说着，村东那岗楼上听到枪声，打开了机关枪，子弹直朝这边飞。他俩不敢多耽搁，急忙回来了。
    二
    回到机关，两个人都受了批评。那何狗皮可就不敢在申家庄待，丧魂失魄的到镇上他父亲那儿，一连躺了好几天，起不来炕。
    不久，申家庄岗楼上的鬼子兵，怕对付不了八路，都撤到镇上去了；只留下伪军在这儿守备。郭三麻子更害了怕，也托病到镇上疗养。黑老蔡他们趁这机会，给岗楼上写了警告信，街上也贴满了抗日救国的宣传品。欢迎伪军反正的标语，一直贴到岗楼上。
    一天晚上，黑老蔡和牛大水正在申耀宗家谈个事儿，忽然听见脚步声。隔着玻璃窗一望，瞧见三个伪军提着枪，走进里院来了。申耀宗变了脸，惊慌的站起来说：“快着！你们藏到套间里去吧！”老蔡可镇静的说：“不碍事，我来应付他们！”他把小手枪掖在袖筒里，盒子枪扔在炕上，装作没有准备的样子；又低声对大水安顿了几句话。三个伪军掀开门帘，进来了。伪军一进来，瞧见炕上坐着一个连鬓胡子的黑大汉，穿着便衣，两只眼睛亮闪闪的对他们打量着；旁边坐着个粗眉大眼的庄稼汉；大乡长申耀宗站在一边，神色很不安。伪军很奇怪，一转眼，又瞧见炕上放着一支盒子枪；他们猜想那两个准是八路军，一时吓慌了，马上就想退出去。可是那庄稼汉叫住他们说：“别走！我们大队长有话跟你们说哩。”
    三个伪军一听是大队长，更害了怕，赶忙都立正，一齐鞠躬说：“大队长有什么吩咐？”黑老蔡拧着眉头问：“这么晚了，你们还出来乱跑什么？”他的膛音很亮，三个伪军听得脸儿发黄，恭恭敬敬的垂着手儿回答：“是，大队长！出来想找口烟过过瘾，没别的意思。”黑老蔡说：“坐下吧！”伪军说：“队长在上，我们立一会儿吧。”老蔡说：“不要紧，都是中国人，坐下谈谈吧。”
    伪军们在靠墙的大坐柜上坐了，把大枪靠在身边。一个烟鬼模样的班长，掏出一盒香烟递过来：“大队长，您请抽！”老蔡说不会抽烟，他又让牛大水抽。大水说：“咱不抽那个，八路军抽惯了纸烟，还了得！”说着，掏出他的小烟袋儿抽旱烟。
    那班长碰了个软钉子，只好给申耀宗递了一支；自己不敢抽，假痴假呆的把烟盒放进口袋里。只见黑大汉扬起眉毛说：“我对你们有个指示！”伪军们瞧他脸上很严肃，觉得形势不妙，连忙立起来，腿儿发抖，说：“大队长，您有什么指示，我们一定照办。”那大队长说：“第一，没事不准出来乱跑！”“是，大队长！”“第二，不准勒索老百姓！”“是，大队长！”“第三，出来不要随便带枪，带枪也得倒背着！”“是，大队长！”“还有，往后有事找保长；不准随便串老百姓的门；老百姓没经过事，哪经得起你们吓唬？你们说对不对？”“是是是，大队长！”
    牛大水咳嗽一声，也扬起眉毛说：“我对你们也有个指示！你们别尽想着吃白面；这年头儿，老百姓哪来那么些白面给你们吃？你们说对不对？”伪军们都点头，说：“是是是！对对对！”
    黑老蔡和颜悦色的说：“你们也不用客气。咱们都是中国人，乡里乡亲的。你看，我们武器都放在炕上，就没把你们当成敌人看待。今天跟你们谈的，你们必须切实做到，我们经常要来检查的。你们可记住了！”他们说：“统统记住了，大队长！”那班长又说：“我们一定本着您的指示前进！”黑老蔡说：“好吧，你们回去吧。以后看你们的表现。”他们说：“是，大队长！以后看吧，反正我们干什么，你们都知道。”
    他们提着枪，又一齐鞠了个躬，就要走。申耀宗急忙走上两步，故意表白说：“李班长，我不送你们了。今天两位八路同志来教育我，捎带把你们也教育了一阵子，这可真是无巧——不巧！哈哈哈！”班长说：“可不，两位同志真把我们点拨开了。这比抽一阵大烟还过瘾呢！”说着，三个人恭恭敬敬的退出去了。
    等他们走远，老蔡他俩才把手枪从袖筒里掏出，忍不住大笑起来，说：“真有意思！这是送上门来，请咱们上了一课！”
