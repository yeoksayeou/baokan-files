Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, May 31st: TASS, Prague reports: The Ninth Congress of the Czechoslovak Communist Party adopted a letter of greetings to Stalin on the 27th.

　　The cable first states that the Congress was convened when the working class and working people, under the leadership of the Czechoslovak Communist Party, defeated the reactionaries in February 1948 and bravely embarked on the road to socialism. The Czechoslovak Communist Party was born under the influence of the great October Socialist Revolution. The reason why the Czechoslovak Communist Party was able to develop into a Bolshevik party and achieve victory was due to learning the richest experiences of the Soviet Bolshevik Party and Stalin. The reason why the Czechoslovak people were able to embark on socialism without bloodshed was because the Soviet army shed blood, defeated the Hitler aggressors, completed the Czechoslovak people's liberation struggle, and prevented the intervention of Western imperialism.

　　The cable stated: "We fully understand the great significance of cooperation with the Soviet Union in our efforts to build socialism, the great significance of the Soviet Union's great material assistance to our economy, and the great significance of the Soviet Union's great power to our security. Our Ninth Congress mobilizes the entire party to complete the great construction tasks of the first five-year plan and to further struggle against the remnants of our bourgeoisie. The Congress is a new step taken by the party on the road of building socialism in our country. In the future, just as today, we will rely on a lasting alliance with the Soviet Union. We will learn from the rich experience of the Soviet people led by the glorious Soviet Communist Party. Therefore, in the future, we must also consolidate the fraternal alliance between the Soviet Union and the Czechoslovak people. We will loyally stand shoulder to shoulder with the Soviet Union in the ranks of the world anti-imperialist camp fighting for peace. We will continue to instill the ideas of internationalism, and the ideas of international friendship between the working class and all the working masses united around the socialist camp, in the Party and all the people of Czechoslovakia."

　　捷共九届代表大会电斯大林致敬
　　在将来也象今天一样，我们将依靠与苏联的持久联盟！
    【新华社北平三十一日电】据塔斯社布拉格讯：捷共第九届代表大会二十七日通过向斯大林致敬的函电。
    电文首先叙述代表大会是工人阶级和劳动人民在捷共领导之下，于一九四八年二月击败了反动派，勇敢地走上社会主义道路的时候召开的。捷共是在伟大的十月社会主义革命影响下诞生的，捷共之所以能够发展成布尔什维克的党并取得胜利，是由于学习苏联布尔什维克党和斯大林的最丰富的经验；捷克斯洛伐克人民之所以能够不流血地走上社会主义，是由于苏军流了血，击败了希特勒侵略者，完成了捷克斯洛伐克人民的解放斗争。并阻止了西方帝国主义的干涉。
    电文中称：“我们充分了解与苏联合作在我们建设社会主义的努力中的重大意义，苏联的伟大物质援助对我国经济的重大意义，苏联的伟大的威力对我国安全的重大意义。我们第九届代表大会动员全党为完成第一个五年计划的伟大建设任务，为反对我国资产阶级残余而进一步斗争。代表大会是党在我国建设社会主义道路上所走的新的一步。在将来也象今天一样，我们将依靠与苏联的持久联盟，我们将学习由光荣的苏联共产党领导的苏联人民的丰富经验。因此，在将来我们也须巩固苏联与捷克斯洛伐克人民的兄弟般的联盟。我们将忠诚地与苏联并肩站在为和平而斗争的世界反帝国主义阵营的行列中。我们将继续在党和捷克斯洛伐克全体人民中，灌输国际主义的思想，灌输工人阶级与一切结团在社会主义阵营周围的劳苦大众之间的国际友谊的思想。”
