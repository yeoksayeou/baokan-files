    US Imperialism Uses a Handful of Scabs
    to Organize "Asian Labor Federation"
    [Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 21st] Under the direct instigation of US imperialism, a handful of Asian scabs, who had been bought off, met in Geneva on the 19th and decided to establish a so-called "Provisional Committee of the Asian Labor Federation" in order to split the labor unity of Asia. The meeting was convened by Tewenson of the Bengal branch of the so-called "Indian National Trade Union Congress" (organized by Indian Minister of the Interior Patel; the progressive Indian national trade union organization is the "All India Trade Union Congress"). Participants included labor representatives from India, Pakistan, Japan, Iran, Turkey, the Philippines, Indonesia, and the Kuomintang. The chairman of the meeting, Banerjee, chairman of the Bengal branch of the Indian National Trade Union Congress, made no secret of the association's reactionary and puppet nature in his speech. He said that the main goal of the Asian Labor Federation would be to "counter the threat of communism." He opposed worker strikes under the oppression of the Asian colonial system, saying that "strikes are an obstacle to industrialization."

    美帝利用一小撮工贼
    筹组“亚洲劳联”
    【新华社北平二十一日电】在美帝国主义的直接策动下，一小撮被收买的亚洲工贼于十九日在日内瓦集会，决议成立所谓“亚洲劳联临时委员会”，以便分裂亚洲的劳工团结。会议是由所谓“印度全国职工大会”（按系印度内政部长巴特尔所组织，印度进步的全国职工会组织为“全印职工大会”）孟加拉分会蒂汶逊召集的，参加者有印度、巴基斯坦、日本、伊朗、土耳其、菲律宾、印尼及国民党的御用劳工代表。该会议主席印度全国职工大会孟加拉分会主席班尼尔吉，在发言中毫不掩饰该会的反动与御用性质。他说：亚洲劳联的主要目标将是“对抗共产主义威胁”。他反对亚洲殖民地制度压榨下的工人工罢工，说什么“罢工是工业化的障碍”。
