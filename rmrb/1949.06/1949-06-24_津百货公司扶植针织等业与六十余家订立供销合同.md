    [Tianjin News] The Tianjin Department Store has recently adopted measures to support the local knitting, rubber, and other industries by supplying raw materials, promoting finished products, and providing processing and manufacturing services. According to May statistics, the company has signed contracts with more than forty knitting, rubber, sewing, and other factories, supplying over 200 bales of cotton yarn and more than 30 tons of rubber, in exchange for finished products such as towels, vests, socks, tires, and sneakers. The number of contracted businesses has increased to over sixty this month (June). This approach allows factories to focus on production with reasonable profits, and also solves their sales problems by purchasing finished products at fair prices.
