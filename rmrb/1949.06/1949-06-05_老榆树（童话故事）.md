　　The Old Elm Tree (A Fairy Tale)
　　甄 Chongde

　　(I)
　　In the mountains, autumn has just passed, and winter has arrived. The crops have all been brought home, and the mountains have changed from green to yellow, and from yellow, gradually become bald. The small river becomes shallower day by day.

　　The wind blows, flying the children's kites during the day, and at night, roaring angrily as if unleashing its fast pace, stepping over the small houses, freezing the small river, and striking the poplars, willows, walnuts... and persimmon trees with its cold palms, causing the leaves to turn red. One by one, they float down.

　　The wind roars, blowing into a small depression in the mountains.

　　There, an old elm tree with many scars squats upright, along with a group of scattered small elm trees shaking their heads.

　　"Mom! It's cold, the wind is here again." A small elm tree heard the wind and shrank its head, moving closer to the old elm tree.

　　"Don't be afraid." The old elm tree said, looking at the children.

　　The wind grew stronger and colder, even carrying small snowflakes.

　　"Mom, it's freezing, and there are snowflakes too!" The small elm tree cried.

　　"Child, your Uncle Wind is just having fun with you, what's there to be afraid of? When the old leaves fall, you'll get new ones next year. Understand? You'll get used to it."

　　The wind laughed wildly again, hanging snowflakes, swirling around the old elm tree's head.

　　"It feels so good to be blown, thank you. Let me tell you, Old Wind and Snow, I've lived for nearly two hundred years and experienced everything – rain, frost, electricity, thunder, hail, drought... My old bones are still hard. That year, I was slapped by electricity, and a layer of skin came off, but I'm still alive. I'm even stronger now."

　　The wind and snow swept over its head, but it didn't move at all.

　　"Old fellow, you're unkillable!" The wind and snow scolded it.

　　The reply was a burst of laughter from the old elm tree, and its hard branches shook proudly.

　　(II)
　　Night, surrounded by cold air. Snow and ice, congealing.

　　The wind roared even more wildly. Just like a tiger.

　　"The leaves have all fallen, it's cold!" the small elm tree exclaimed.

　　"My leaves fell off last year, and I almost froze to death. This year is colder and earlier than last year," said another short elm tree, bending at the waist.

　　"Living frozen is not as happy as dying!" A small elm tree with all its leaves fallen off said with a mournful face.

　　The old elm tree, seeing them angry, shook its head, then calmed down and said:

　　"You spineless fellows, only know how to live in warmth, pitiful, hopeless!"

　　Cold weather is also a part of life, if you can't get through the cold, how can you reach the warm spring?

　　It continued:

　　"I also grow in the cold snow and freezing, my blood flows under the ice, my face is covered with frost, and I still smile."

　　It warned:

　　"Those who can't endure the cold also can't endure fire-like heat, and they are also afraid of dying in the hot weather of June."

　　The small elm trees, after hearing this from the old elm tree, bravely raised their heads. Their courage also increased. They all nodded and said:

　　"The braver you live, the more happiness you get, the more interesting it is! Right?"

　　"Right! Right! Right! Life is struggle, and in struggle you can grow up and become useful materials." The old elm tree happily answered them.

　　(III)
　　In the mountains, under the sun of a cold morning, the small elm trees shook their heads, happily and bravely growing, the old elm tree leading them in singing:

　　The sun is out,
　　Shining red in the sky.
　　We are not afraid of wind and rain.
　　Not afraid of thunder, lightning and frost.
　　Cowardice is shameful,
　　Struggle has strength!

　　The songs of the old elm tree and the small elm trees become louder and louder as the years go by. No small insects grow on the old, crooked body, and the small, straight bodies stand tall. In this place where wind, snow, ice, and hail alternate, they welcome the arrival of spring!

　　老榆树（童话故事）
    甄崇德
　　（一）
    在山里，秋天刚过，冬天来了，庄稼都收回家里，山上由绿色变成黄色，由黄色，渐渐又变成秃顶了。小河一天一天的浅下去。
    风，刮起来了，在白天吹着孩子们的风筝，在夜里，呼呼的发怒似的荡开它好快的脚步，踏过小屋，吹冻了小河，用它冰冷的手掌，打过白杨、柳树、核桃……柿子树打的叶子都红了。一片一片的往下飘。
    风，吼着，吹到一个小山洼里。
    那里直挺挺的蹲着一棵多疤的老榆树，和一群散乱着摇着脑袋的小榆树。
    ——妈！冷，风又来了。一棵小榆树听见风就缩了头，靠近老榆树说。
    ——不怕。老榆树说着看了孩子们一眼。
    风，越来越大，越来越冷，还挟着小雪片哩。
    风吼着，卷落了小榆树的叶子。
    ——妈，冷死了，还有雪片呢！小榆树哭泣了。
    ——孩子，你风叔叔，不过和你开开心，怕什么，旧叶子落了，明年就又换上新的。懂吧？惯了就好了。
    风，又狂笑了，挂着雪片，卷在老榆树头上。
    ——吹在我身上，好痛快，谢谢你，我告诉你，老风雪，我活了将近二百年什么也经过了，雨、霜、电、雷、雹、旱……我的老骨头，一直还硬着，那年挨了电一巴掌，脱了层皮，我又活到现在，我更结实了。
    风雪从它头上扫过去，它一点也不动。
    ——老家伙，死不了的！风雪骂它道。
    回答他的，是老榆树的一阵笑声，坚硬的枝条，还得意的摇动了一下。
　　（二）
    夜，冷气包围着。雪与冰，凝结着。
    风，吼叫的更不象样子了。简直和老虎一样。
    ——叶落光了，冷呀！小榆树嚷着。
    ——去年我的叶子就落光了，差点没冻死，今年比去年还冷得早。另一棵弯曲着腰的矮榆树说。
    ——冻着活着，还不如死了幸福呢！一棵浑身叶子落得干干净净的小榆树哭丧着脸说。
    老榆树，看着他们生气了，摇了摇头，又平静下来说道：
    ——没志气的家伙们，光知道在温暖里生活，可怜呀，害差呀！
    冷天也是生活的节气，你过不了冷，那能到温暖的春天呢？
    它又接着说下去。
    ——我在冷雪、封冻下也成长着，血脉伸到冰底下流着，脸上蒙满了霜，我还要笑。
    它又警告着说：
    ——挨不过冷的家伙，也挨不过火般的热，六月暑天，也怕枯死了。
    小榆树，听了老榆树这段话，勇敢的抬起头来。胆气也大了。都点头说：
    ——生活越勇敢，越得到幸福，越有意思！对吗？
    ——对！对！对！生活就是斗争，在斗争里你们才能长大，才能成有用之材。老榆树欢喜的回答了它们。
　　（三）
    在山里，在严寒早晨的太阳之下，小榆树摇着头儿，快活的勇敢的成长着，老榆树带领着它们唱着歌儿：
    太阳出来了，
    站在天上放红光。
    我们不怕风和雨。
    不怕雷、电和雪霜。
    胆小是可耻，
    斗争有力量！
    老榆树和小榆树的歌声，年代越久，越响亮。老的弯曲的身上，没生一条小虫儿，小的笔直的身子，高大的站起来。在这风雪、冰、雹交替往来的地方，迎接着春天的到来！
