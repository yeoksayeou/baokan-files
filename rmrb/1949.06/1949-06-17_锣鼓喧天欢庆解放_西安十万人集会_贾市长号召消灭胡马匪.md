  　Ten Thousand People Gather in Xi'an
  　Mayor Jia Calls for Elimination of the Hu-Ma Bandit Gang
    [Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, 16th] Three hundred and sixty-five units from all walks of life in Xi'an held a grand rally at Revolutionary Park Square on the 12th to celebrate the liberation of Xi'an and welcome the People's Liberation Army. Nearly 100,000 people attended, including workers, commanders and fighters of the People's Liberation Army, staff members of various Xi'an municipal organs, students, representatives of women, and representatives of commercial groups. The venue was filled with red flags, and slogans were shouted everywhere. Fifty to sixty Yangko teams, stilt teams, and propaganda teams sang and danced continuously, and the sounds of gongs and drums and cheers merged into one. This was the first grand gathering of the people of Xi'an. The conference opened at around 4 p.m. to the sound of cannons and military music. In addition to representatives of the citizens presenting flags to the People's Liberation Army, military and government leaders such as Jia Tuofu, Deputy Director of the Military Control Commission and Mayor of Xi'an Municipal People's Government, and representatives of people from all walks of life delivered speeches. In his speech, Mayor Jia Tuofu called on the people of the city to fully support the struggle to eliminate the Hu-Ma bandit gang. He said that Xi'an is now a city belonging to the people, but many places in Shaanxi and other provinces such as Gansu, Qinghai, Ningxia, and Xinjiang have not yet been liberated. In order to eliminate the remnant forces of the Hu-Ma bandit gang, the people of the city should shoulder the current combat tasks: First, support the People's Liberation Army. Second, assist the Military Control Commission, the Municipal Government, and public security organs in exposing hidden Kuomintang special agents and consolidating revolutionary order. Third, restore and develop production, stabilize finance, transform Xi'an into a production fortress in the entire Northwest, and cooperate with the Military Control Commission to quickly complete the takeover and establish a people's government.
