　　Tsinghua, Peking University, and Seven Other Universities' Chinese Department Professors
  　Hold Symposium Yesterday on Curriculum Reform

    [Our Newspaper] Tsinghua, Peking University, China University, Normal University, Yenching University, Fu Jen Catholic University, Sino-French University, and other seven universities' Chinese department professors and lecturers held a curriculum reform symposium at 9:30 AM yesterday (the 5th) at Peking University's Zimin Hall. Representatives from the North China Higher Education Commission and cultural figures were also invited to participate. Those present included Zhou Yang, Yang Zhensheng, Luo Changpei, Li Guangtian, Li Jinxi, Yu Jiaxi, Gu Sui, Li Helin, Tang Lan, Wei Jiangong, Yang Hui, Gao Mingkai, Yu Pingbo, Pu Jiangqing, Chen Mengjia, Xu Wei＠, Lin Geng, Li Changzhi, Sun Kaidi, Ye Dingyi, Liu Pansui, and more than sixty others. At the meeting, everyone spoke enthusiastically about the curriculum reform issues in Chinese departments, as well as the relationship between language and literature. Speakers unanimously pointed out that in the future, Chinese departments in various universities can each have their own focus based on the different conditions of each school. For example, Tsinghua can emphasize literature, and Peking University can emphasize language, without forcing uniformity. Regarding the Chinese cultural heritage, it is necessary to use new viewpoints and new methods to sort it out and accept it critically, and open up a vast field for academic research in the new China.

    [Also News] Professors and lecturers from the history, political science, and philosophy departments of various universities in Beijing also held symposiums at Peking University yesterday to discuss issues related to curriculum reform.
