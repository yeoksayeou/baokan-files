Xinhua News Agency, Peiping, June 24th: TASS reports: June 22nd marks the eighth anniversary of the invasion of the Soviet Union by Hitler's Germany. Moscow newspapers have all published editorials and other articles to commemorate this day. The *Pravda* editorial emphasizes that German fascism, which grew up under a great deal of American loans, intended to crush the resistance of the Soviet army with a sudden attack, "resolve" the Soviet Union in a month and a half to two months, and then proceed to implement its crazy plan to seize world hegemony further. Initially, the reactionary British and American newspapers had calculated how many days or hours were left for the "final defeat" of the Soviet Union. After Germany's defeat near Moscow, and after the glorious battles of Stalingrad and Kursk, they fell silent. The victory belongs to the Soviet social system, and to Stalin's political and strategic genius. The Soviet Union saved European civilization and the future of mankind. *Pravda* then spoke of the remarkable achievements of the Soviet economy in the post-war period, and wrote: What can the leaders of the capitalist world boast about? In the United States, unemployment is increasing, production levels are declining, and the working people are becoming increasingly impoverished. In the past six months alone, industrial production in the United States has decreased by 11 percent, and the number of unemployed and semi-unemployed has reached 15 million, even according to incomplete statistics. As for the capitalist countries of Western Europe, their economies are completely and inextricably dependent on American monopoly capital, and are now inevitably going downhill. The terrifying specter of a new economic crisis stands at the threshold of capitalist countries. *Pravda* concluded by saying: The results of the Second World War are the strengthening of the Soviet Union, the departure of several countries in Eastern and Southeastern Europe from the capitalist system, the consolidation of the socialist camp, and the weakening of the capitalist camp. The fate of capitalism is sealed, its era is coming to an end. The forces of socialism and democracy are invincible. This is the main achievement of the war. This is also the main achievement of the post-war years. It is a waste of energy for international reactionaries to try to turn back the wheels of history.

    苏联纪念抗德八周年
    真理报指出：胜利的是苏维埃制度，资本主义的时代即将告终了。
    【新华社北平二十四日电】塔斯社讯：六月二十二日，是希特勒德国侵略苏联的八周年。莫斯科各报都发表社论和其他论文，来纪念这个日子。真理报社论着重指出：在美国很多的贷款之下成长起来的德国法西斯主义，打算以突然的袭击粉碎苏军的抵抗，在一个半月到两个月之间“解决”苏联，而随后着手实现其进一步的夺取全世界霸权的疯狂计划。起初，英美反动派报纸曾经计算苏联“最后败北”还有几天或几小时。德国在莫斯科附近溃败之后，在光辉的斯大林格勒与库尔斯克战役之后，他们缄口无言了。胜利的是苏维埃社会制度，是斯大林的政治和战略天才。苏联拯救了欧洲的文明和人类的未来。随后真理报说到战后时期苏维埃经济的显著成果，并写道：资本主义世界的领袖们，能够吹嘘什么呢。在美国，失业正在增加，生产水平下降着，劳动人民日益贫困。仅仅在过去六个月之内，美国的工业产量就减少了百分之十一，而失业与半失业的人数甚至根据不完全的统计，数字也已以达到一千五百万人。至于西欧资本主义国家，它们的经济已完全和不可分地依赖美国独占资本，现在正不可避免地走着下坡路。新经济危机的吓人的幽灵，站在资本主义国家的门槛上。真理报结语称：第二次世界大战的结果是苏联的增强，东欧与东南欧若干国家之脱离了资本主义制度，社会主义阵营的巩固和资本主义阵营的削弱。资本主义的命运是注定了的，它的时代即将告终了。社会主义与民主底力量是无敌的。这就是战争底主要成果。这也是战后几年底主要成果。国际反动派想要扭转历史的车轮是白费气力的。
