Taiyue Radio Dispatch: The spring plowing and sowing work in the entire Taiyue area has been completed. Among the seventeen counties under the jurisdiction of the entire area, Yicheng, Jiangxian, Lingshi, and Huoxian of the first and second special districts, due to the warmer climate and more cotton planting, the replanting work started around Guyu (Grain Rain) and was completed by mid-May. In the northern mountainous areas of Taiyue, such as Qinyuan and Anze counties, due to the colder climate and more autumn land, it started on May 4th and by the 21st, beans, corn, etc. were also successively planted. Regarding the overall sowing situation, except for the first special district which did not have detailed statistics, the nine counties of the second and third special districts planted a total of 253,500 mu of cotton in 22,289,000 mu of autumn land, exceeding last year's cotton planting number by 30 percent. If we add the sown area in the cotton-producing areas of Lingshi and Huoxian, it will be possible to complete the task of planting 300,000 mu of cotton in the entire area this year. Other oil crops are also generally close to completing the plan.

Currently, except for the disaster areas of northern Taiyue, which are being replanted after destruction by freezing, other areas where seedlings have emerged are actively carrying out seedling weeding campaigns. Jincheng County's seedling weeding work started around May 20th, and now two-thirds of the county's 380,000 mu of autumn seedlings have been weeded. In Nanmajiang Administrative Village of the first district, village cadres took the lead in combining with thirteen mutual aid groups to formulate seedling weeding plans and launch mutual competitions; in seven days, all 1,230 mu of autumn seedlings in the village were weeded, and it is estimated that all seedlings in the county will be weeded by June 10th. Xizhuang and Songwang villages in Yangcheng actively launched mutual aid seedling weeding campaigns in late May. In seedling weeding, general attention was paid to organizing women and providing preferential treatment to families of martyrs, soldiers, and cadres. For example, the 57 mu of paddy fields belonging to families of martyrs, soldiers, and cadres without labor in Xizhangzhuang of the first district have all been weeded first.

Jinan Radio Dispatch: Farmers in southern Hebei are combining wheat harvesting with intensive seedling weeding. The district Party and government leading organs of Guangzong County are seizing the gap before wheat harvest to universally mobilize farmers to weed seedlings once, and districts have started weeding one after another. At the end of last month, villages around the city carried out a rush weeding after rain, and Xiangzhuang Village weeded its large seedlings once in less than three days. Farmers in Yuanzhuang, first district of Qinghe County, accepted the experience of weeding cotton seedlings twice before wheat harvest last year to prevent aphids, and immediately weeded seedlings a second time after weeding them once. Farmers in Guozhuang, Wei County, weed seedlings during wheat harvest, dividing a piece of wheat into three or four harvests to squeeze out time for weeding seedlings. The village organized 20 temporary mutual aid groups, which not only harvested wheat in a timely manner, but also saved labor for weeding 440 mu of seedlings. Farmers in Jize, Longyao, and other counties also came up with various ways to weed seedlings during wheat harvest. Some sun-dried wheat and then carried hoes to the fields, and many women went to the fields to participate in seedling weeding and competed with men.

　　太岳播种完成　冀南结合麦收加紧锄苗
    【太岳电】太岳全区春耕播种工作已全部结束。全区所辖十七个县中，一、二专署之翼城、绛县、灵石、霍县因气候较暖，植棉较多，翻种工作从谷雨前后开始，至五月中旬，已全部种完。岳北山区沁源、安泽等县，因气候较冷，秋地较多，从五月四日开始，截至二十一日，豆子、玉茭等也先后种完。整个播种情况，除一专署未详细统计外，二、三专署九个县，二千二百二十八万九千亩秋地中，共种棉花二十五万三千五百亩，超过去年种棉数百分之三十。如加上灵石、霍县产棉区之下种数目，则将可完成今年全区植棉三十万亩之任务。其他油料作物，一般也近于完成计划。
    现全区除岳北冻灾地区正在毁种补种外，其他出苗地区，正积极展开锄苗运动。晋城全县的锄苗工作，从五月二十日前后开始，现在全县三十八万亩秋苗已锄完三分之二。一区南马匠行政村，村干部带头结合了十三个互助组，订出锄苗计划，互相展开竞赛；七天光景，全村一千二百三十多亩秋苗全部锄完，估计六月十日前全县苗即可全部锄完。阳城西庄、宋王等村，在五月下旬，已热烈展开互助锄苗运动。锄苗中一般都注意了组织妇女和对烈、军、干属的优待。如一区西张庄无劳力烈、军，干属的五十七亩谷地，都已尽先锄完。
    【冀南电】冀南农民结合麦收紧张锄苗。广宗县区党政领导机关抓紧麦前空隙，普遍动员农民锄头遍苗，各区已先后开锄。上月底城周围各村落雨后，进行了突击抢锄，相庄一村不足三天即将大苗锄完头遍。清河一区袁庄的农民，接受去年麦前棉苗锄二遍不生蚜虫的经验，锄完头遍就接着锄二遍。威县郭庄农民在收麦间隙中锄苗，有的一块麦子分成三四次割，挤出时间锄苗，仅在麦收期间全村即锄苗近三百亩。高庄组织了二十个临时互助组，不但麦收应时，还省出功夫锄苗四百四十亩。鸡泽、隆尧等县农民也想出各种办法在麦收间隙锄苗，有的晒上麦子就扛锄下地，许多妇女下地参加锄苗与男子竞赛。
