　　Beiping Municipal Public Enterprise Wage Adjustment Experience
　　Our reporters Tian Liu, Shang Kai
　　The work of initially adjusting the unreasonable wage system in many public enterprises in Beiping has now basically ended. It may not be unhelpful to summarize the problems that occurred in the work and the experience gained.
　　The wage system in bureaucratic capitalist enterprises, like any other institution of the Kuomintang reactionaries, had many corrupt, dark, and unreasonable aspects. For example: 1. Using personal connections to curry favor, obtain high positions, and receive high wages, even creating positions for people to receive dry wages. 2. Although technically good, those who were upright and would not flatter or pander, and even fought against the factory or supervisors for the benefit of the workers, were demoted, had their salaries reduced, and were forever buried. 3. Deliberately raising the treatment of staff members, tempting them with small benefits, in order to strengthen the rule over workers. 4. Lowering the treatment of technical personnel and staff members, in order to reduce the reasons for workers to demand improved treatment. Whether raising or lowering the treatment of staff or technicians, it was all in order to further squeeze and exploit the workers. After the completion of the takeover, when the enterprises belonged to the people, all these things had to be reformed. However, because we did not thoroughly explain to all employees what the unreasonable wage problem was, and the principles of adjustment and reform, at the time of the takeover or after the takeover, but only publicized "improving the lives of workers" in isolation, and separated from the production situation of the factory, therefore, when adjusting wages, the employees mistakenly believed that it was a universal increase in wages, and even in some factories, during the evaluation, the employees blindly advocated "raise everyone, lower everyone."
　　The First Motor Repair Factory under the Telecommunications Bureau fully recognized this situation, made sufficient preparations in advance, and resolutely relied on the working class and followed the mass line when conducting the evaluation, so that the wage adjustment was successfully completed, achieving the goals of worker unity and production development.
　　The factory proceeded as follows: The factory administration, the Party, and the trade union first conducted repeated education for all employees, explaining that the adjustment of wages was to reform the unreasonable wage system and achieve the goal of unity and production. Then, according to the different production units of the entire factory, they were divided into thirteen groups, and each group democratically elected a representative to form a wage evaluation committee. The committee studied the standards for dividing employees into grades, the methods of evaluation, and the possible biases in the evaluation and how to prevent them more than once. Because this factory was a new factory formed by the merger of several different factories after liberation, the wage standards were inconsistent, and the employees did not understand each other, it was decided to adopt the "self-reporting and public evaluation" method of mobilizing all employees to participate in the evaluation. The specific steps were that each group discussed and passed the more specific standards of its department according to the grading standards drafted by the evaluation committee. Workers were divided into six grades and eighteen levels, and technical personnel were divided into four grades and sixteen levels. After each person reported themselves, the whole group evaluated, first evaluating the grade and then dividing the level. This was the first step. The second step was the evaluation by the evaluation committee, and the third step was the announcement, and then group discussion, and each group (department) put forward specific opinions, which were discussed and approved by all parties, and then used as a final decision. In order to gain experience, the factory administration, the trade union, and the evaluation committee unified their steps and started from two groups as a typical study and demonstration. Because there were clear and specific grading standards and sufficient mobilization and preparation in advance, the phenomenon of universally raising wages in self-reporting and public evaluation rarely occurred, and the excessive demands of individual employees were quickly corrected by public evaluation by the masses. This is one type, and the People's Paper Mill and others belong to this type.
　　The second type is represented by the First Machine Factory, and the Agricultural Machine Factory and the 70th Ordnance Factory also belong to it. Its characteristic is that although there was preparatory work, it was not sufficient. Several twists and turns occurred in the wage evaluation process, but the leadership timely summarized the experience and learned the lessons, and finally achieved the goal of reasonable wage adjustment. The wage adjustment process of the First Machine Factory was as follows: In advance, the administration and the trade union held three employee meetings to explain the purpose and methods of wage evaluation and to prevent and overcome egalitarianism. Then, twenty-one representatives were selected according to the production unit and the number of people to conduct the evaluation. First, preliminary evaluations were conducted in each institute, and then they were gathered together to conduct the factory evaluation. Because of the lack of clear standards and specific explanations for specific issues in advance, the fitter department experienced the phenomenon of demanding excessive wages, which affected other units, and the idea of ​​egalitarianism rose again. Taking the forging workshop as an example, there were a total of eighteen people in the workshop, and their wages were lower than those of other employees. The wages of the blacksmiths were not even as high as those of the odd-job workers in the factory. During the initial evaluation, they proposed "increase everyone". The representatives of other units opposed it when they heard it, forming a dispute. Originally, it was extremely natural for the blacksmiths to demand a reasonable increase in wages, but it was wrong to demand an excessively high increase. The comrades who led the wage evaluation did not persuade the blacksmiths on the one hand, nor did they persuade the representatives of other units on the other hand, and first affirmed the correct part of the blacksmiths' workshop, but simply denied it. The representative of the workshop said: "If you want me to be a representative, this is the opinion. If not, I will not be a representative."
　　Finally, when the military representative stationed in the factory approved it, the military representative took a look and said that each department was high and had to be reworked, which caused fluctuations throughout the factory. The representatives said: "The evaluation doesn't count. Why do you want us to evaluate?" It even seriously affected production. Later, the military representative accepted the trade union's suggestion and carefully studied the results of the evaluation of each unit. In fact, it was not a universal high evaluation. For example, the machinist, carpenter, foundry, and washing departments were all evaluated very well. The military representative realized that he had made a hasty and subjective mistake, so he immediately took the initiative to convene a meeting of all wage evaluation committee members, made a self-criticism, and expressed his determination to listen to and adopt the correct opinions of the workers. Comrade Liang Hua of the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions used this incident to explain the difference between people's enterprises and bureaucratic capitalist enterprises, and detailed the current economic situation in the liberated areas and the inevitable agricultural harvest failure caused by the drought, calling on workers to take care of the overall situation, to share weal and woe with all working people; and explained the principle of improving the lives of workers and the people in the development of production. The representatives were deeply moved by the military representative's frank attitude and spirit of serving the people. Those who demanded excessive wages during the initial evaluation voluntarily lowered them. The evaluation of all wages was completed very quickly and smoothly. As a result, the representatives were satisfied, all the employees were satisfied, and the administration was also satisfied.
　　The above two factories' wage adjustment situation can represent the city's public factory wage adjustment situation. Generally speaking, this wage adjustment was successful: through the wage adjustment, the workers were educated, united, and mobilized, laying a very important preparation for future development of production. But this is not without exception: some factories did not regard wage adjustment as a political task, did not combine it with the mobilization of workers, and did not combine it with the workers' movement to realize the democratization of enterprise management. They simply adjusted for the sake of adjustment. One factory even completely abandoned the workers and let a few original staff members "revise" it, which not only did not eliminate the unreasonableness, but greatly damaged the employees' sense of ownership.
　　In this wage adjustment, according to the reporter's preliminary understanding, the following basic experiences were obtained. (1) Wage adjustment is to guarantee the lives of workers and achieve the goal of unity and development of production. It must be done as an extremely important political task, so it is necessary to actively lead and mobilize the workers to do it. Not only must there be sufficient preparatory work and strong leadership during the work process, but the most important thing is to rely on the proletariat from beginning to end and follow the mass line. (2) At the beginning of entering the city, adhering to the "do not disrupt the original enterprise organization" and "original position and original salary" was of great significance for carrying out the takeover, restoring production, and stabilizing the emotions of employees. Later, employee opinions were absorbed in the mobilization of workers, and the unreasonable phenomena in the old organizations, personnel, and wages were timely reformed and adjusted in order to further mobilize workers to restore and develop production. This time should not be delayed too long. The wage adjustment of individual factories in Beiping was later, which once had some impact on mobilizing workers and developing production. (3) When the responsible comrades of the First Motor Repair Factory, the People's Paper Mill, and the First Machine Factory talked about the experience of wage adjustment, they all said: "Just talk more." Speak at large meetings, speak at small meetings, speak individually, speak anytime and anywhere, talk about the national economic situation, talk about the lives of peasants, talk about the factory's production situation, as long as the truth is made clear, the wage adjustment will smoothly reach a reasonable level. (4) The method should make full use of group meetings, which is the basic way to promote democracy and make wage evaluation reasonable; at the same time, avoid comparing different production departments in the wage evaluation. Experience has proved that this comparison will fall into unprincipled disputes. Moreover, the nature of production is different and cannot be compared at all.

　　北平市公营企业调整工资经验
    本报记者  田流  商恺
    北平市许多公营企业中初步调整过去不合理的工资制度的工作，现已基本上结束了。将工作中发生的问题和获得的经验加以总结，或者不是无益的。
    在官僚资本企业中之工资制度，同国民党反动派其他任何机构一样，存在着许多腐败、黑暗和不合理的地方。譬如：一、利用私人关系拉拢，获得高位，拿高工资，甚至因人设职拿干薪。二、技术虽好，但性情耿直，不会逢迎献媚，甚至为着工人的利益向厂方、主管人斗争，遭到降级、减薪、永被埋没。三、故意提高职员的待遇，诱以小利，以加强对工人的统治。四、降低技术人员、职员待遇，以减少工人要求改善待遇的理由。无论提高或降低职员、技工的待遇，都为了达到其进一步压榨剥削工人的目的。这些在完成接管，企业已属于人民所有之后，都必须加以改革的。但由于我们在接管时或接管后没有及时透彻地向全体职工说清楚这种不合理工资毛病究竟何在，及调整改革的原则，却孤立的宣传“改善工人生活”，和本厂的生产情况脱离开来，因此调整工资时，职工误认为是普遍提高工资，甚至有的厂在评议时，职工们盲目地主张“升全升，降全降”。
    电讯总局所属之第一电机修配厂充分认识了这种情况，事先作了足够的准备工作，并在进行评议时坚决依靠工人阶级，走群众路线，即使工资调整顺利完成，达到了职工团结、发展生产的目的。
    该厂是这样进行的：工厂行政、党及工会首先对全体职工进行了反复的教育，说明调整工资是为了改革不合理的工资制度，达到团结生产的目的。而后按全厂不同的生产单位划分成十三个小组，每组民主选举一代表，组成评资委员会。委员会不止一次地研究了职工划分等级的标准，评资的方法和评议中可能发生的偏向和如何预防。因为本厂是解放后才由几个不同的厂合并组成的新工厂，工资标准不一致，职工间互不了解，决定采用发动全体职工参加评议的“自报公议”办法。具体步骤是各小组根据评委会拟定的划分等级标准讨论通过后，拟出本部门更具体的标准。工人共分六等十八级，技术人员分四等十六级，每个人自报后，全组评议，先评等后分级，这是第一步。第二步是评委会评议，第三步是公布，再分组讨论，各个小组（部门）再具体提出意见，经各方商量讨论通过修正批准后，作为定案。为着取得经验，工厂行政、工会及评委会统一步调，先从两个组作起，作为典型研究和示范。因为有明确具体的划分等级标准，和事先充分的动员准备，自报公议中普遍提高工资的现象很少发生，个别职工的过高要求也很快被群众公议纠正了。这是一种类型，人民造纸厂等都属于这一种。
    第二种类型以第一机器厂为代表，农业机器厂，七十兵工厂等均属之。它的特点是虽有准备工作，但不够充分，评资过程中发生几次波折，但领导上及时的总结经验，吸取教训，也终于达到了合理调整工资的目的。第一机器厂调整工资经过是这样的：事先行政上与工会召开过三次职工大会，解释评资目的、方法，防止与克服平均主义。而后按生产单位和人数选出二十一位代表评议，先以各所为单位进行初评，而后集合起来进行厂评。因为事先缺乏明确的标准和对具体问题的具体解释，钳工部便发生了要求过高工资的现象，并影响了别的单位，平均主义思想又形抬头。举锻工所为例，该所共十八个人，工资同其他职工比起来就是低，打铁工人还没有厂里的小工杂工工资多。初评时，他们提出“要增都增”，别的单位代表一听都反对，形成纠纷。本来，锻工要求合理的增一些工资是极其自然的，但要求长的过高是不对的。领导评资的同志一方面没有说服锻工，另方面也没有说服其他单位代表，首先肯定锻工所正确的部分，只是单纯的否定，该所代表说：“要我当代表，就是这个意见，要不，我就不当代表。”
    最后请驻厂军事代表批准时，军事代表一看又说各部门都高，要推翻重作，引起全厂波动。代表们说：“评了不算数，还要我们评干什么？”甚至严重的影响到生产。军事代表后来接受了工会建议，仔细研究了各单位评的结果，其实也不是普遍评的高。如机工、木工、翻砂、洗工等部评的都很好。军事代表发现自己犯了急燥主观的错误，便立时主动的召集全体评资委员开会，作了自我检讨，并表示坚决听取和采纳工人正确意见。市总工会梁化同志就用这件事情说明人民企业与官僚资本企业不同的地方，并详细介绍了目前解放区的经济情况和因天旱所必然引起的农业歉收，号召工人照顾全局，要同全体劳动人民共患难，同甘苦；并说明在发展生产中改善工人及人民生活的道理。代表们见到军事代表的磊落态度与为人民服务的精神，听了梁化同志的话，都深受感动，初评时要求过高的人，自动降低了。全部工资的评议，很迅速地顺利完成了。结果，代表们满意，全体职工满意，行政上也满意。
    上述两个厂的调整工资情形，可代表全市公营工厂调整工资情形。此次调整工资，一般说来是成功的：通过调整工资，教育、团结和发动了工人，为今后发展生产作好了一个很重要的准备。但并不是没有例外：有的厂没有把调整工资视为政治任务，没有和发动工人结合，没有和实现企业管理民主化的职工运动结合，单纯地为调整而调整，有一个厂甚至完全撇开工人，让几个原来的职员“订了订”，结果不但没有消灭了不合理，反而大大损害了职工的主人翁感觉。
    在这次调整工资中，据记者初步了解，获得了下述的几个基本经验。（一）调整工资是要保障工人的生活，达到职工团结发展生产的目的，要作为一个极其重要的政治任务去作，因此必须积极的领导发动工人去作，不但要有充分的准备工作和工作进行中的坚强领导，最重要的应该自始至终的依靠无产阶级，走群众路线。（二）初进城时坚持了“不打乱原来的企业机构”，“原职原薪”，这对于进行接管和恢复生产，安定职工情绪，有极重要的意义，后来在发动工人中吸收了职工意见，及时的对旧的机构、人事、工资中不合理的现象，加以必要的改革与调整，以便进一步发动工人，恢复和发展生产。这一时间不能拖得太久。北平有个别厂调整工资较晚，曾经对发动工人和发展生产发生了某些影响。（三）第一电机修配厂、人民造纸厂、第一机器厂的负责同志谈到调整工资经验时都说：“就是多讲”。大会讲、小会讲、个别讲、随时随地讲，讲国家经济情况、讲农民生活、讲本厂生产情况，只要把道理讲清楚，调整工资是会顺利的达到合理的。（四）方式要充分运用小组会，这是发扬民主使工资评议获得合理的基本方式；同时要避免在评资中各个不同生产部门的比较，经验证明，这种比较会陷入无原则纠纷的。而且生产性质不同，是根本不能相比的。
