　　China Electric Organizes Engineering Team
  　To Build Power Plant in Datong
    [This Newspaper's Dispatch] In order to implement the construction plan for this year passed by the recent enlarged meeting and to quickly resume coal mining in Datong, the Engineering Department of the North China Electric Power Company has formed a Datong Engineering Team of more than 20 people, led by Captain Wu Huanlin and representative Fan Chifu. They will depart for Datong on the 21st of this month to start building a power plant. It is reported that the Datong coalfield has abundant coal reserves and good quality, but due to the lack of power generation equipment, it cannot be mined. The departure of this engineering team is planned to generate electricity by the end of this year, and to carry out water drainage projects next spring (there is a lot of water in the mine), so that the coal mine can be mined.

　　华电组织工程队
  　将赴大同建发电厂
    【本报讯】华北电业公司工程处为贯彻最近扩大会议通过之本年度建设计划，迅速恢复大同煤矿开采，现已组成二十余人之大同工程队，由队长吴焕琳、代表范炽夫带领，将于本月二十一日赴大同着手建设发电厂。按大同煤田储煤丰富，质量也好，但因现无发电设备，致无法开采。此次工程队出发，计划本年底发电，明春即进行打水工程（矿内存水甚多），使煤矿能进行开采。（柏青）
