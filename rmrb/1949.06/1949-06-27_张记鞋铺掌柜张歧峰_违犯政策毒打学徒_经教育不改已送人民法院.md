　　Zhang Qifeng, Owner of Zhangji Shoe Store
  　Violates Policy and Brutally Beats Apprentice
  　Sent to People's Court After Refusing to Change Despite Education
    [Our Newspaper] Zhang Qifeng, owner of Zhangji Shang Shoe Store in Nanhiaoshun Alley, Eighth District of Ping City, disregards the government's "Labor-Capital Both Benefit" policy and brutally beats his apprentice. After education, he refused to change and has been sent to the People's Court for legal action. The apprentice, Wang Dali, entered the store last November. He has no relatives or friends in Ping City and has always been subjected to abuse and torture by the owner. Before liberation, he worked 20 hours a day, and even after liberation, he still worked 18 hours. Zhang Qifeng used red-hot fire pokers to beat his face, head, and ears; he once broke Wang's head with a copper ruler, causing blood to flow profusely, and later used two packets of tooth powder to cover the wound. Usually, in addition to working, Wang Dali also took care of the owner's children. If the children cried, he would be scolded and beaten. Sometimes he had to set up a shoe stall in front of the Qianmen gate. If the shoes didn't sell, he would be beaten upon his return. According to people in the store, Wang Dali was beaten twice every three days. As a result, Wang Dali's ears have been deafened, and his nerves have become abnormal due to fear. On the 20th of this month, Wang Dali was caught dozing off due to extreme fatigue by the second owner, Zhang Wenru, and was beaten. The next day, Zhang Qifeng heard about this and ran over, shouting to Wang Dali, "Don't sew, I'll teach you a lesson!" He kicked Wang Dali to the ground and began to beat him brutally. After the beating, he pried open Wang Dali's mouth, smeared dung into it with firewood, and smeared it all over his face. Neighbors, seeing that the young apprentice was on the verge of death, reported it to the district government. After Zhang Qifeng was summoned to the district government, he initially denied everything, then said, "Beating and scolding him is for his own good." Finally, he admitted to the various facts of abusing the apprentice, admitted his mistake, sought a guarantor, and signed a pledge, guaranteeing that such behavior would never happen again, and was released. Unexpectedly, the second day after his release, Zhang Qifeng called Wang Dali from the store to his home, locked him in a small dark room, and tried to chop him to death with a kitchen knife. Fortunately, he was discovered, and the district government was notified again. The district government then sent Zhang Qifeng to the People's Court for legal action. The people of the district are extremely indignant at Zhang Qifeng and his brutal behavior. The Municipal Federation of Trade Unions has also decided to convene a meeting of owners and apprentices in the district recently to explain that the government will never allow any owner to infringe upon the human rights and inflict corporal punishment on apprentices, and to educate both parties to practice the government's call to respect teachers and love students, improve the relationship between teachers and apprentices, and develop production.

　　张记鞋铺掌柜张歧峰
  　违犯政策毒打学徒
  　经教育不改已送人民法院
    【本报讯】平市八区南孝顺胡同张记尚鞋铺掌柜张歧峰蔑视政府“劳资两利”政策，毒打学徒，经教育不改，已送交人民法院法办。学徒王大礼去冬十一月进入该铺，在平无亲无友，一向受掌柜虐待摧残，解放前每日工作二十小时，解放后仍达十八小时。张歧峰曾以烧红的火箸殴打他的脸、头、耳朵；曾以铜尺击破他的头，血流如注，以后用两包牙粉才糊住伤口。平时王大礼除做活外，并给掌柜看孩子，孩子一哭就要挨骂挨打，有时候又到前门摆鞋摊，鞋卖不动，回来也要挨打。据铺里人讲，王大礼每三天要挨打两次。结果，王大礼两耳已被打聋，并且因为害怕，神经已失正常。本月二十日，王大礼因倦极打盹，被二掌柜张文儒看见，打了一顿。次日张歧峰听知这事，就一面跑过去，一面对王大礼喊道：“你先别缝活啦，我来教训教训你！”跟着一脚把他踹倒在地，开始毒打。打完，又把王大礼的嘴撬开，用劈柴往嘴里抹粪，并涂了一脸。邻居眼看小学徒已奄奄一息，就告到区政府。张歧峰被传到区政府以后，起初对一切都不承认，以后又说：“打他骂他，是为了他好。”最后才承认了虐待学徒的种种事实。并且认错，觅保、具结，保证以后决不再发生类此行为，即将其释出。不料释出第二日，张歧峰就把王大礼从铺子里叫到家中去，关在一间小黑屋子里，拿菜刀要把他砍死，幸亏被人撞见，就又告到区政府。区政府乃将张歧峰送人民法院法办。该区人民对张歧峰及此残暴行为极为愤懑，市职工总会也决定最近要在该区召集掌柜和学徒会议，说明政府决不允许任何掌柜有对学徒侵犯人权和体罚的行为，并且要教育双方实践政府尊师爱徒的号召，改善师徒关系，以便发展生产。
