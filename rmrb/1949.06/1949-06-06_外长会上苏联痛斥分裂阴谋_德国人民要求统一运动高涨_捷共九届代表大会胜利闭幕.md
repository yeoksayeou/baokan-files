  　At Foreign Ministers' Meeting, Soviet Union Denounces Separatist Conspiracy
  　German People's Movement for Reunification Surges
    Ninth Congress of the Czechoslovak Communist Party Concludes Successfully
    The meeting of the Foreign Ministers of the Soviet Union, the United States, Britain, and France, which began in Paris on May 23, has now lasted for two weeks. In those two weeks, the four foreign ministers have held ten public meetings and two private meetings, discussing two items on the agenda: the German reunification issue and the Berlin issue. Due to repeated urging by the Soviet representative, the United States, Britain, and France finally presented their proposal on the German reunification issue. This proposal advocates implementing the reactionary "Bonn Constitution" and the "Occupation Statute" enslaving the West German people throughout Germany, and advocates not applying the principle of unanimous agreement in the so-called "High Commission" (a controlling body replacing the Control Council). After the proposal of the United States, Britain, and France was put forward, it was strongly denounced and rejected by the Soviet representative. The Soviet representative pointed out that this proposal "is the completion of the Western countries' separatist activities in Germany and the logical consequence of the systematic destruction of the principles of the Potsdam Agreement by the United States, Britain, and France." "From the perspective of the Potsdam Agreement, democratic principles, the interests of the German people, and the interests of peace-making for Germany and the whole of Europe, the proposal of the US, British and French representatives on the issue of German reunification is unacceptable." Because the United States, Britain, and France insisted on their imperialist separatist policy on this issue, the discussion reached a deadlock and has been suspended. The Foreign Ministers' Meeting has now begun to discuss the Berlin issue, and the four representatives have put forward their respective proposals. The meeting has moved into private discussions of these proposals.
    The German People's Congress, representing the true will of 65 million German people, held its Third Congress in Berlin on May 29 and 30. 2,016 delegates attended the Congress, and despite various obstructions by the three Western occupying authorities in West Germany, approximately 500 West German delegates managed to attend. The Congress discussed the issue of "Germany and the Paris Foreign Ministers' Meeting." The Congress passed a letter to the German people, calling on the people of the whole country to strengthen the national united front to strive for German reunification and peace, to fight together for a unified, independent, and peaceful Germany, and to fight for the rapid conclusion of a peace treaty and the withdrawal of occupying forces. The Congress also passed the draft "Constitution of the German Democratic Republic" adopted by the German People's Council on March 19, and elected a new German People's Council to lead the realization of the struggle goals listed in the declaration. On the other hand, the US, British, and French authorities are still continuing to violate the will of the German people and implement concrete measures to split Germany. They have successively convened meetings regarding the establishment of the Ruhr International Authority, appointed high commissioners to Germany, and approved the election law of the "German Parliamentary Council."
    The Ninth Congress of the Czechoslovak Communist Party, which opened on May 25, concluded on May 29. Leaders or representatives of fraternal parties from more than 40 countries, including the Soviet Union, China, France, Italy, Britain, Germany, and Poland, participated in this congress. The spirit of internationalism and the unity of the world's proletarian parties were fully manifested at this congress. The congress discussed and summarized the achievements of the fifteen months since the historical turning point of February 1948, unanimously approved the political line of the Central Committee of the Czechoslovak Communist Party, stipulated the tasks of the Czechoslovak Communist Party in socialist construction, adopted the new Party Constitution, and elected a new Central Committee with Gottwald as Chairman and Slánský as General Secretary. During the five-day session, the congress received 52,000 congratulatory letters and telegrams from all over the country. The congress demonstrated the unity of the entire Czechoslovak Communist Party and the love of the entire Czechoslovak people for the Czechoslovak Communist Party. As the congratulatory telegram from the Central Committee of the CPSU stated, the Czechoslovak Communist Party, with 2.5 million members and leading the people of the whole country, "will further strengthen and consolidate its ranks after this congress and gloriously complete the great task of building a socialist society."
    The Second Congress of the Polish Trade Unions began in Warsaw on June 1. The Polish working class greeted the opening of the congress with production competitions and extra-plan production. Trade union leaders from the World Federation of Trade Unions, the Soviet Union, France, Italy, Czechoslovakia, and other countries, as well as the Chinese representative, brought congratulations to the congress and the experience of the struggles and production of the working classes of various countries. At the congress, Polish President Bierut made an important report, believing that the congress was "a manifestation of the broadest unity of the Polish working people," and pointed out the tasks of the Polish working class and its trade unions, which hold power and have become masters of the country. This congress of the largest trade union in the new democratic country of Eastern Europe, with 3.6 million members, is a major event in the world workers' movement.
    From May 28 to 29, the Indian Trade Union Congress was held in Bombay in a tense political atmosphere. More than 700 representatives gathered together despite the various persecutions of the Nehru government, demonstrating the heroic struggle and unity of the Indian proletariat. The resolutions of the congress firmly opposed the North Atlantic Treaty, an imperialist attempt to provoke a new world war; opposed the decision of the Commonwealth Prime Ministers' Conference regarding India's remaining in the Commonwealth (this is a clear demonstration of the Indian reactionary bourgeoisie betraying the cause of the Indian people's liberation), demanding the struggle for India's true independence; opposed the measures of the Indian reactionary class to continuously lower the living standards of workers (including agricultural workers); and opposed the Nehru government's brutal persecution of workers' leaders and democratic elements. The All-India Trade Union Congress's work report for the past two years, published at the congress, emphasized that the Indian reactionary government's suppression actions were proceeding simultaneously with the conspiracy to split the Indian trade union movement. Therefore, one of the basic tasks of the congress is to form a strong united front of the Indian working class, to stop the divisive activities of the enemies of the working class—reformists and leaders of the Socialist Party—and to successfully resist the fierce attacks of the capitalists. The Nehru government's announcement of various restrictions on the congress before it was held, and the beating of worker representatives during the congress, only demonstrated the panic of the Indian agents of US and British imperialism in the face of the Indian people's movement for true independence and democracy. The Indian government originally planned to convene a pro-government "Asian Labor Federation" in Indore, but it ended in a shameful abortion. This fact shows that the organized working class of India firmly stands on the side of the peace and democracy camp headed by the Communist Party.

### 外长会上苏联痛斥分裂阴谋　德国人民要求统一运动高涨  捷共九届代表大会胜利闭幕

  　外长会上苏联痛斥分裂阴谋
  　德国人民要求统一运动高涨
    捷共九届代表大会胜利闭幕
    五月二十三日开始在巴黎举行的苏美英法外长会议，现已历时两周。在两周中间，四国外长举行了十次公开会议，两次秘密会议；讨论了议程中的两个问题：德国统一问题和柏林问题。由于苏联代表的多次敦促，美英法终于提出了他们关于德国统一问题的建议案。这个建议案主张将反动的“波恩宪法”和奴役西德人民的“占领法规”在全德实施，主张在所谓“高级委员会”（代替管委会的管制机构）中不施用一致协议的原则。美英法的建议案提出后，遭到苏联代表的痛斥和拒绝。苏联代表指出，这一建议“是西方国家在德国的分裂活动的完成，是美英法有系统地破坏波茨坦协议之原则的逻辑的后果”。“从波茨坦协议、从民主原则、从德国人民的利益以及德国与整个欧洲的缔造和平的利益出发，美英法代表关于德国统一问题的建议是无法接受的。”由于在这一问题上美英法坚持其帝国主义的分裂政策，讨论遂僵持不决，并已暂停举行。外长会议现已开始讨论柏林问题，四国代表分别提出了他们的建议，会议已转入秘密方式讨论这些建议。
    代表六千五百万德国人民的真正意志的德国人民代表大会，五月二十九、三十两日在柏林举行了第三届大会。出席大会的代表二千十六名，虽然西德三占领当局多方阻挠，仍有约五百名西德代表赶来参加。大会讨论了“德国与巴黎外长会议”问题。大会通过了告德国人民书，号召全国人民加强争取德国统一与和平的全国阵线，共同为统一、独立与和平的德国而斗争，为迅速缔结和约与撤退占领军而斗争。大会又通过了德国人民委员会于三月十九日通过的“德国人民共和国宪法”草案，选举了新的德国人民委员会，以领导实现宣言中所列举的斗争目标。另一方面，美英法当局却还在继续违反德国人民的意志，实行分裂德国的具体措施。它们先后召开了有关成立鲁尔国际管制局的会议，委任了驻德高级专员和批准了“德国议会委员会”选举法。
    五月二十五日揭幕的捷克斯洛伐克共产党第九届代表大会，已于五月二十九日闭幕。这次大会有苏、中、法、意、英、德、波等四十余国兄弟党的领袖或代表参加。国际主义的精神，世界无产阶级政党的团结，在这次大会上充分地表露出来。大会讨论和总结了一九四八年二月历史性转折点以来十五个月的工作成果，一致批准了捷共中央委员会的政治路线，规定了捷共在社会主义建设中的任务，通过了新党章，选举出以哥特瓦尔德为主席，斯兰斯基为总书记的新的中央委员会。大会在五天会期中收到全国各地纷至沓来的五万二千件祝贺的函电。大会表现了捷共全党的团结，表现了全捷人民对捷共的爱戴。正如联共中央贺电所说，拥有二百五十万党员和领导着全国人民的捷共，在这届代表大会之后，“必将进一步加强与紧密它的队伍，光荣地完成建立社会主义社会的伟大任务”。
    波兰职工会第二届代表大会，从六月一日起在华沙举行。波兰工人阶级以生产竞赛，以超计划的额外生产来迎接大会的召开。世界工联、苏、法、意、捷等国的职工会领袖和中国代表，都给大会带来了祝贺，并带来了各国工人阶级的斗争和生产的经验。大会上，波兰总统贝鲁特作了重要的报告，认为大会是波兰“劳动人民最广泛团结的表现”，指出了掌握着政权和成为国家主人翁的波兰工人阶级及其职工会的任务。这个拥有三百六十万会员的东欧新民主国家最大的职工会代表大会，是世界工人运动中的一件大事。
    五月二十八日至二十九日，印度职工大会在孟买市紧张的政治气氛中举行，七百余代表不顾尼赫鲁政府的种种迫害，集聚一堂，表现了印度无产阶级英勇奋斗与团结一致的力量。大会的决议坚决反对帝国主义挑拨新世界战争的北大西洋公约；反对英联邦总理会议关于印度留在英联邦内的决议（这是印度反动资产阶级叛卖印度人民解放事业的明证），要求争取印度的真正独立；反对印度反动阶级不断降低工人（包括农业工人）生活水平的措施；反对尼赫鲁政府残酷迫害工人领袖和民主分子的行为。大会所发表的全印职工大会两年来的工作报告，着重指出印度反动政府的镇压行动是与分裂印度职工运动的阴谋勾当同时并进的。因此，大会的基本任务之一，便是组成印度工人阶级强有力的统一战线，制止工人阶级敌人——改良主义者和社会党首脑们的分裂活动，并胜利地抵抗资本家的猛烈进攻。尼赫鲁政府在大会举行之前，便对大会宣布了各种限制，在大会开会期间又殴打工人代表，这只是表现了美英帝国主义的印度代理人，在印度人民争取真正独立民主运动面前的惊慌。印政府原来计划在印多尔召集御用的“亚洲劳工联合会”，但终归可耻地流产了。这一事实表明印度有组织的工人阶级，是坚定地站在以共产党为首的和平民主阵营方面的。
