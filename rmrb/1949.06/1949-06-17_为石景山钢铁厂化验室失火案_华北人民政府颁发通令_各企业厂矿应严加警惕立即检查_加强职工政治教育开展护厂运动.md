[Report from this newspaper] Regarding the fire in the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant laboratory, the North China People's Government has issued a circular to all enterprises, government agencies, factories, and mines. The full text is as follows:

The laboratory of the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant under the North China Iron and Steel Company caught fire at approximately 4:00 AM on May 25th and was extinguished by 7:00 AM. After the fire broke out, workers and security guards of the plant, Liu Liang, Zhang Lian, Liang Zhanru, and Jia Shilin, discovered it and immediately called for help. Besides salvaging some medicines and instruments such as balances, the rest was destroyed by the fire. It is estimated that the loss of medicines and instruments is worth approximately 13 million RMB, eleven rooms are worth approximately 29 million RMB, along with six high-temperature gauges, one steel carbon analyzer, and various valuable items such as experimental records and samples since the establishment of the laboratory (in 1938). After the incident, the North China People's Supervisory Institute, the Public Enterprise Department of the North China People's Government, the Public Security Bureau of the Beijing Municipal People's Government, the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, and the Preparatory Committee of the Beijing Municipal Federation of Trade Unions separately sent personnel to inspect and hold meetings to investigate. It was proven that the fire was not caused by electrical short circuits, but by excessive heat in the ore smelting furnace in the laboratory, which ignited the wooden boards and reeds inside the wall, spreading to the roof wiring, causing the fire to spread to nearby rooms. Jin Huai, the person in charge of the laboratory, designed and built this furnace in the winter of 1946. The furnace body was close to the reed wall, with the chimney bricked on three sides and against the wall on one side. The inner layer was not lined with fire-resistant bricks, and at temperatures of 800 to 1200 degrees Celsius, it was baked and ignited.

Causes of the fire:

A. The main reason is the negligence of duty by the director of the laboratory and the poor management by the factory leadership. Although the factory director, An Chaojun, had corrected Jin Huai for not assigning anyone to manage the electric furnace at night (the laboratory originally used an indoor electric furnace for testing, but later switched to a coke-fired furnace), he turned a blind eye to Jin Huai's consistent irresponsibility and the lax discipline of the night shift personnel habitually sleeping. He did not strictly inspect and correct these issues. His negligence led to this major disaster, for which he should be held responsible for poor management. Jin Huai, the director of the laboratory, had a poor work style and was consistently irresponsible. After liberation, he did not change the corrupt practices of the past Kuomintang reactionary bureaucratic institutions. The inventory he handled did not match the actual items, and he omitted many valuable medicines, mixing good and bad medicines together, attempting to resist accountability. Before the fire, the work team leader, Lai Yimin, proposed that the iron smelting and coking plants jointly organize shifts, but Jin refused on the grounds that "the iron smelting plant's laboratory has no problems." Three days before the fire, when using an electric furnace to burn pellets, he did not assign anyone to work at night, nor did he extinguish the furnace. After work, he locked the door and went home. Director An discovered this and personally went to his home to urge him to send someone to put out the fire. This time, when using the coke-fired furnace, he did not inspect it carefully and assigned a young worker to work, without giving him clear instructions, allowing him to sleep, and placing five gallons of alcohol in the room, which was prone to accidents. After the fire, Jin still behaved perfunctorily, attributing the responsibility to objective reasons, such as saying he did not know that the furnace was close to the reed wall; that the four people in the laboratory were very busy, and had to assign the young worker Zhao Jinji to work, etc. It was found that the furnace had been built for several years, and Jin had worked in the room for a long time. Whether in construction or use, the possible impact of high temperatures of 800 to 1200 degrees Celsius should have been considered and inspected. (According to common sense, it should have been considered whether the partition wall was made of brick, and whether the medicines and equipment in the adjacent warehouse would be at risk due to excessive heat transfer.) According to the young worker Zhao Jinji: "Currently, only ore is being tested, and the work is not busy. Zhao Jinji could be replaced by a helper at night." Jin was well aware of the habit of sleeping on night shifts in the factory, but he did not strictly instruct Zhao Jinji not to sleep. This proves that the fire was mainly caused by Jin Huai's dereliction of duty and irresponsibility. Therefore, Jin Huai should be directly responsible for the fire.

The furnace-watching young worker Zhao Jinji was introduced to the laboratory by Director An in January of last year to work as a young worker. That night, he checked the furnace twice, at 6:00 PM and 11:00 PM. After the last check at 2:00 AM, he turned off the lights, locked the door, and went back to the sampling room of the coking plant laboratory in the same courtyard to sleep. He was awakened by the fire at 4:00 AM. Although he bravely rescued two balances at the time, which could mitigate his fault, his sleeping on duty prevented him from discovering the fire in time and taking early rescue measures, resulting in huge losses. He still cannot escape his responsibility for dereliction of duty.

The fire brigade was poorly prepared beforehand, and the night-duty personnel were also very irresponsible. According to the usual practice, the fire brigade has two people on duty at night every hour, one to watch the telephone and one to patrol the laboratory, the factory office, the garage, the gasoline depot, etc. However, Wang Yanshi, who was on duty and patrolling from 3:00 to 4:00 AM, was found to have slept for more than 40 minutes during his one-hour shift, showing the abandonment of discipline. After the fire broke out, the diesel engine for firefighting took half an hour to repair before it could pump water. It broke down again after pumping a few times, the fire hose leaked, the ladder to the roof was unusable, the fire hook fell off as soon as it was used, and there were no alarm bells or whistles. The firefighters' firefighting skills were not proficient. Such phenomena revealed unexpected corruption. Therefore, the spread of the fire into a disaster shows the paralysis and laxity of the factory's usual management.

B. Other serious shortcomings in administrative management:

(1) Although the factory leadership had air defense arrangements and organized workers' security teams twice, the attention to protecting factory property and the actual measures taken were very poor in terms of guiding ideology. For example, there were no effective arrangements and inspections for the aforementioned fire brigade work; the laboratory, light oil yard, tar yard, and by-product yard were all easily flammable, but were not regarded as key areas for protection; after the fire at the Liulihe Cement Factory, the Enterprise Department of this government issued a circular to factories in various places to be vigilant, but this did not attract attention. The document was received on the 19th and distributed to various units by Manager Li Gongda on the 20th, but it was found that the document was still backlogged in the document section on the 27th (two days after the fire); the phenomenon of sleeping on duty at night has been going on for more than a day, but it has never been corrected; management is not strict, and theft constantly occurs (e.g., on May 1st, twelve thieves colluded to steal a generator and 130 drill bits from the north factory); the factory's machinery and equipment are not inspected strictly, and damage often occurs (e.g., the iron smelting plant lost a cylinder of oxygen, the power plant burned out a 100-horsepower electric motor, some machines are not working, many electric gates that should be repaired are not, and the ground wire was damaged during the war but not repaired, etc.); after the fire at the Beijing Trolleybus Company, the municipal government arranged for all factories to pay attention to fire prevention, but the factory did not discuss fire prevention measures with the trade union. Many fire incidents were published in the newspapers, but the factory's bulletin board never mentioned the word fire prevention.

(2) The factory has approximately 3,000 employees. In general, employees showed positive attitudes in the two months after liberation, but due to serious shortcomings in the takeover work, the Kuomintang's bureaucratic factory management system and various unreasonable phenomena were not adjusted in time. No education or effective measures were taken to address the irresponsibility of some employees. Since the takeover, the factory leadership has not implemented a strict system of responsibility at each level, and other work systems are also unsound. Generally speaking, discipline is lax, and management is slack. Therefore, sleeping on night shifts, the fire brigade not actively preparing for firefighting, many people stopping work before the end of the work day, or being late, leaving early, asking for leave for excuses, and arbitrary absenteeism are not uncommon. The number of sick and personal leave days from January to May is increasing day by day. This kind of laxity is the root cause of all problems.

(3) Due to poor management, problems are emerging one after another. The takeover personnel and factory leaders are neither able to conduct thorough investigations among the workers to find the key to solving problems, nor are they able to listen to the opinions of the workers, leading to criticism from the workers that "things are discussed with the workers in form, but not democratic in substance." Some workers even sharply asked: "Are you officials of Chiang Kai-shek or officials of Chairman Mao? If you are officials of Chiang Kai-shek, please get out. If you are officials of Chairman Mao, come down and lead us!" The voices of the masses deserve serious attention.

(4) The factory management committee has not yet been established, and the sense of responsibility of employees cannot be further strengthened. Therefore, many shortcomings in the work cannot be exposed and improved in time.

(5) Neglecting security work: There is no security work organization, no leadership to mobilize the workers to carry out necessary struggles against sabotage and slowdowns to protect the factory.

In order to overcome the above shortcomings, the following improvement work should be started immediately in a planned and step-by-step manner:

A. After the fire, the factory launched a widespread and in-depth inspection among employees to summarize experiences and lessons, and formulated labor discipline. It has begun to implement reasonable suggestions put forward by employees, which is good. However, how to implement a strict system of responsibility at each level, adjust the wage system, and clarify rewards and punishments still needs to be studied and improved. It is also an important link for the factory to quickly move towards organization and order to formulate internal rules and regulations for work, dormitory management regulations, and entry and exit leave systems.

B. The factory has now begun to pay attention to air defense and fire prevention, but it should pay special attention to improving fire-fighting equipment and organizing training. Strengthen the management of warehouse agencies and equipment, and pay special attention to establishing internal security organizations to uniformly lead the factory police and workers' security teams, and regularly be responsible for studying and inspecting factory property safety facilities to prevent theft and sabotage.

C. Establish and improve the factory management committee, strengthen the responsibility of employees for managing production, go deep into the masses, strengthen the ties between superiors and subordinates, carry out criticism and self-criticism, expose shortcomings in a timely manner, improve leadership, unite all employees, and supervise and improve production. The Enterprise Department of this government should also consider establishing a special inspection agency for factory safety equipment to be responsible for this task.

D. The trade union should strengthen the education of employees on protecting factory property and labor discipline.

The factory should pay close attention to these points and seek rapid improvement.

After the fire incident, after inspections by various parties, this government repeatedly invited various parties to study and believed that the factory is the largest iron smelting industry in North China, the laboratory is large-scale, and it is also the technical guidance agency for the factory's production. This fire occurred after the Beijing Trolleybus Company's vehicles were burned down and the Liulihe Cement Factory's laboratory was destroyed by fire, and the leading organs of Beijing Municipality and the Public Enterprise Department of this government issued circulars to warn and be vigilant. The factory still neglected its duties, resulting in the fire. It is by no means comparable to accidental negligence. In order to educate the factory's employees and improve the management of factories throughout the area, the following punishments and awards are decided based on the different merits and responsibilities:

A. An Chaojun, as the factory director, has a heavy responsibility. He did not strictly inspect the factory equipment and failed to supervise his subordinates effectively, resulting in a major disaster. He should have been removed from his post, but considering that the factory director does have some objective difficulties in leadership, and since taking office, he has shown hard work in technical matters, he is leniently given a demerit as a warning to observe his future performance. Chen Lei, the person in charge of the factory's takeover team, bears the heavy responsibility of taking over the factory. After serving for several months, he failed to fulfill his supervisory duties and improve the factory's management as much as possible, and his responsibility is relatively heavy. It is requested that the Beijing Military Control Commission of the People's Liberation Army remove him from his post for investigation. Yu Shoukang, the director of the takeover team's representative office, worked in the factory at the same time as Chen Lei and did not strictly inspect the factory. He should be given a minor demerit. Manager Li Gongda and concurrently representative Zhang Fang are not directly responsible for the laboratory work, and both of them had only been in office for a short time. They went to Tianjin on official business the day before the fire and were not present, so their responsibility is relatively light. However, they should also be criticized for failing to lead and prevent in advance. As for the Enterprise Department of this government, although it has issued circulars and instructions on preventing accidents in leadership, it lacks organized inspection and should conduct a review within the department, learn from past mistakes, and draw experience and lessons to guide and improve the management of factories throughout the area.

B. Jin Huai was the direct person responsible for the accident. Although there is no material to prove that it was intentional, his consistent irresponsibility and dereliction of duty are the main reasons for the accident. It is by no means a momentary negligence or carelessness. He should be removed from his post and handed over to the court for investigation. The young worker Zhao Jinji slept on the night shift, violating work discipline and causing a major disaster. However, he made efforts to rescue after the event, which can slightly make up for his fault. He should be given a lighter punishment and dismissed from his post. During Jin Huai's interrogation, he should not leave the factory temporarily to await questioning by the court for evidence.

C. Wang Yanshi, the fire brigade patrolman, was responsible for patrolling the laboratory area. He slept for more than 40 minutes during his one-hour shift, failing to discover the fire in time and causing a major disaster. He should be dismissed. Ran Shuyuan, the captain of the fire brigade, was ineffective in his daily work, his preparations were too poor, and his management of the team was not strict, resulting in panic and incompetence at the time of the incident, aggravating the loss. He should be removed from his post.

D. Workers' security guards Liu Liang, Zhang Lian, Liang Zhanru, and Jia Shilin consciously protected the factory, bravely rescued it, and protected the people's property. They should be commended in a circular. Other employees who actively participated in the firefighting should also be rewarded separately by the factory.

Based on this fire incident at the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant, we should learn the following experiences and lessons:

A. Since the liberation of major cities in our region, fires have repeatedly occurred in warehouses and factories. The experience and lessons learned have not been summarized and used for education, and the responsibility has not been strictly investigated, so that it has not yet generally aroused the serious vigilance of the responsible cadres. This is what we should pay serious attention to in the future. Secondly, it is right not to disrupt the original institutions of the production enterprises taken over from the reactionary rule at the initial stage of the takeover, but it is wrong not to strive to rectify and transform their bureaucratic organizations and styles as quickly as possible.

B. Judging from the repeated fire incidents in the factory and other factories in the past, although there are various reasons, the main reason is that the staff lack the due sense of responsibility for the custody of the people's property. In the future, we must strengthen the political education of the management personnel of public enterprises, which is the basic problem; but we must also supplement it with clear rewards and punishments in order to further improve vigilance. Therefore, it is necessary to give appropriate punishment to those who violate the law and neglect their duties, and give praise and rewards to those who have made contributions to management.

C. The fire in the factory also shows that many responsible cadres lack experience in the management of larger enterprises. They are neither good at using the policy of military management to supervise production, nor do they have the spirit to learn scientific management humbly; they are even less good at relying on and uniting the workers to supervise the factory. They neglect and are paralyzed in rectifying discipline and carefully arranging security work. Therefore, the work of preventing spies, air defense, and theft is extremely negligent, so accidents continue to occur. For this reason, the higher-level leading organs must strengthen work inspections, summarize and exchange experiences in order to quickly overcome the serious shortcomings in management. After the fire, due to the tight grip of the leadership, it has aroused the vigilance of the factory's employees and workers, and they have generally conducted self-examinations from the bottom up, and put forward many suggestions for improvement, proving that as long as the leadership pays attention, shortcomings can be gradually overcome.

D. The factory's employees are all very saddened by the loss of the laboratory. At various meetings, they unanimously demanded that the responsibility be investigated, and put forward many opinions on the leadership of representatives, managers, and factory directors, and provided many methods for property management and labor discipline, proving that the vast number of the factory's employees are truly actively caring for the factory. The question is whether the leadership is willing to rely on the workers wholeheartedly. Only together with the masses of employees and workers can we carry out the plant protection movement and carry out effective security and prevention work. The factory's self-criticism from the bottom up has cleared the cadres' bureaucratic style, exposed the shortcomings of the work, and strived to improve, which is a very good phenomenon. As long as we are good at mobilizing all employees and workers to jointly manage production and strictly implement various systems, all difficulties and disasters can be overcome and avoided.

All public enterprises, agencies, factories, and warehouses must, in accordance with the fire situation and experiences and lessons of the factory, discuss in depth, immediately inspect the management of their departments, improve leadership, unite workers and the masses, conduct in-depth inspections of specific work, and deploy fire prevention, anti-special protection plant movements, especially places and items that are prone to danger, should pay more attention; improve the sense of responsibility for the people's property, and unanimously strive to unite all employees and workers to improve factory management and improve production.

　　为石景山钢铁厂化验室失火案
  　华北人民政府颁发通令
    各企业厂矿应严加警惕立即检查
  　加强职工政治教育开展护厂运动
    【本报讯】华北人民政府顷为石景山钢铁厂化验室失火案通令各企业机关工厂矿山，全文如下：
    华北钢铁公司石景山钢铁厂化验室，于五月二十五日晨四时许失火，至七时救熄。火起后，经该厂工人保卫队员刘良、张连、梁占如、贾士林四人发现，立即喊救，除抢出药品，天秤等仪器一部外，其余均遭焚毁。计：损失药品仪器约值人民券一千三百万元，房屋十一间约值人民券两千九百万元，及高温计六个、钢铁定炭分拆器一个，及化验室成立（民国二十七年）以来的实验记录与样本等珍品多种。事后经本府华北人民监察院、公营企业部、北平市人民政府公安局及全国职工总会、北平市职工总会筹备委员会分别派员检查，并开会研究；证明此次失火，并非电线走火致灾，而是由于化验室化炼矿石闷炉热度过高，引着夹墙内之木板、苇草，延至房顶电线，遂使火势蔓延附近各室。该化验室主管人晋怀曾于三十五年冬季设计修建此炉，炉身靠夹苇墙，烟突三面砌砖，一面靠墙，里层未砌耐火砖，经八百度至一千二百度之高温，遂被烤燃起火。
    失火原因：
    甲、主要由于该化验室主任怠于职守，及工厂领导上管理不善。该厂厂长安朝俊，虽曾纠正过晋怀曾夜晚不派人管理电炉（该化验室原用室内电炉试验，后改用焦炭闷炉），但对晋怀曾工作之一贯不负责及值夜班人员惯常睡觉等纪律松懈现象熟视无睹，均未严格检查纠正。疏忽失察，酿此巨灾，应负管理不善的责任。该化验室主任晋怀曾，作风不良，工作一贯不负责，解放后，并未转变过去国民党反动官僚机构的腐败作风，其经手之清册与实物不符，遗漏不少贵重药品，且将好坏药品杂置一起，有抵抗交代企图。失火以前，工作组赖毅敏，曾提议炼铁炼焦两厂共同组织值班，晋却以“炼铁厂化验室没事”为借口，加以拒绝；失火前三天，用电炉烧团矿，入夜不加值班，亦不灭炉，下班后锁门回家，经安厂长发觉，曾亲赴其家中督促，始派人灭火；此次使用闷炉复漫不检查，派小工值班，不加谆嘱，任其睡觉，且将五加仑酒精放在屋内，自易出险。失火后，晋仍表现敷衍，将责任均诿为客观原因，如说不知此炉系靠夹苇墙；化验室四人，工作很忙，不得不派小工赵晋基值班等语。查该炉已修建数年，晋长期在该室工作。无论修建与使用，八○○度至一二○○度之高温，其可能发生之影响，均应有必要之考虑与检查。（根据常识，隔墙是否均用砖砌，隔室仓库之药品器材，是否会因传热过大发生危险）据小工赵晋基说：“目前仅化验矿石，工作不忙，晚上可以不派赵晋基，而改派帮工值班，且厂内夜值班睡觉的习惯，晋所夙知，并未严嘱赵晋基不要睡觉。”据此证明，此次失火主要系由晋怀曾玩忽职务、不负责任所致，故晋怀曾应直接负火灾的责任。
    看炉小工赵晋基，于去年一月经安厂长介绍到化验室当小工。是夜值班，于六时、十一时看炉两次，最后二时看过后，即关熄电灯，锁上房门，竟回同院炼焦厂化验室之取样室睡觉。四时火起始被叫醒，虽当时奋勇抢出天秤两架，可以减过；但值班睡觉，不能及时发现火警，赶早施救，以致火势蔓延损失甚巨，仍不能不究其失职之责。
    消防队事前疏于准备，值夜人员亦很不负责。向例：消防队夜间每小时均有两人值班，一人看电话，一人巡逻化验室、厂部办公室、汽车库、汽油库等处。但三至四点值班巡逻的王延世，竟有在一小时之值班时间内睡觉四十余分钟之事情，可见纪律之废弛。火发后，救火之柴油机直修理半小时后始能抽水，抽几下后又生故障，水龙带漏水，上房梯子不能用，火钩一用即掉落，又无警钟警哨设备，队员救火技术不熟练，诸如此类的现象，其腐败出人意外。因此火势蔓延成灾，足见该厂平时管理上之麻痹松懈。
    乙、行政管理工作上存在的其他严重缺点：
    （１）该厂领导上虽有防空布置，两次组织工人保卫队，但在指导思想上保卫工厂财产之注意与实际工作之措施均极差，如：对前述消防队工作没有切实布置与检查；化验室、轻油场、焦油场、副产场均易引火，并未作为保卫重点；琉璃河洋灰厂失火后，本府企业部通令各地工厂警惕，并未引起注意，部文于十九日收到，经李公达经理于二十日批发各单位，但经检查该件二十七日（失火后二日）仍积压于文书科；夜间值班睡觉现象已非一日，始终未予纠正；管理不严，不断发生偷盗（如五月一日，北厂竟被十二个窃犯合伙偷走一个发电滚及一百三十个钻头）；该厂机器器材检查不严，经常发生破坏（如炼铁厂跑失氧气一筒，电力厂烧毁一百马力电滚一个，有些机器不灵，不少电闸该修不修，地线经战争中受了震动，亦不检修等）；北平电车公司失火事件发生后，市政府布置各厂注意防范火险，该厂并未与工会商议防火办法，报纸登载失火事件不少，该厂布告上却未曾提到过防火字样。
    （２）该厂员工约三千人，解放后两个月，职员工人一般表现积极，但因接管工作有严重缺点，对国民党官僚化的工厂管理制度及各种不合理现象，未能及时调整，对部分职员工作不负责现象，亦未作教育及有效措施；自接管到现在，该厂领导上，未实行严格的按级负责制，其他工作制度亦均不健全，一般说是纪律松弛，管理懈怠，因此，值夜班睡觉，消防队不积极进行消防准备，不少人员不到下班就停止工作，或者迟到早退，借故请假与随意旷工者亦不一而足，一月至五月的事假病假数目逐日增加着。此种松懈现象，是一切问题发生的总根源。
    （３）由于管理不善，问题丛生，而接管人员及工厂负责人，既不能深入工人进行全面调查研究，找出解决问题的关键，又不能倾听工人意见，以致被工人批评为“形式上事事经过工人讨论，但实质上不民主。”甚至有的工人尖锐提出：“你们是蒋介石的官，还是毛主席的官？如是蒋介石的官就请滚蛋，如是毛主席的官就下来领导我们！”群众呼声深值警惕。
    （４）工厂管理委员会尚未建立，职工责任心不能进一步加强，因而工作上很多缺点，不能得到及时地揭发与改进。
    （５）忽视保卫工作：没有保卫工作的组织，没有领导发动工人群众与破坏怠工分子进行必要的斗争，以保卫工厂。
    为克服上述缺点，应立即有计划、有步骤地着手以下改进工作：
    甲、该厂失火后，发动职工进行普遍深入的检查，总结经验教训，订立劳动纪律，根据职工提出的合理意见，已开始实行，这是好的。但如何实施严格的按级负责制，调整工资制度，严明赏罚等，尚须研究改进。至制定厂内办事细则与工作间工作细则，宿舍管理规程，出入门请假制度等，亦为工厂迅速走向组织化秩序化的重要环节。
    乙、目前该厂已开始注意防空防火，但尤应注意健全防火设备及组织训练。加强仓库机关器材之保管工作，特别应注意建立厂内保卫组织，统一领导厂警队与工人保卫队，经常负责研究与检查工厂财产安全设施，防范偷盗及怠工破坏。
    丙、建立与健全工厂管理委员会，加强职工管理生产的责任心，深入群众，应密切上下级联系，开展批评与自我批评，及时揭露缺点，改进领导，团结全体职工，监督改进生产。本府企业部并应考虑建立关于工厂安全设备的专门检查机构，以专责成。
    丁、职工会应加强职工爱护工厂财产及劳动纪律的教育。
    凡此诸端，该厂应加以严切注意迅求改进。
    此次失火案件，经各方面派员检查后，本府先后数次邀集各方面研究，认为该厂系华北最大之炼铁工业，化验室规模很大，又系该厂生产之技术指导机关；此次失火发生于电车公司烧毁车辆、琉璃河洋灰厂化验室焚毁事件之后，且经北平市领导机关及本府公营企业部通令告诫警惕，该厂仍因怠忽职守，致生火险，决非偶然疏忽过失可比。为教育该厂职工及改进全区工厂管理，特分别功过及责任之不同，决定如下之惩奖：
    甲、安朝俊身为厂长，责任綦重，对工厂设备检查不严，对下属督察不力，致成巨灾，本应撤职；但念该厂长在领导上确有某些客观上之困难，任职以来，对技术范围内的工作尚表现努力奋勉，从宽予以记大过一次之处分，以观后效。该厂接管组负责人陈雷，负接管重责，到职数月，未能克尽监督与可能地改进工厂管理工作之任务，责任较重；应请人民解放军北平军事管制委员会予以撤职查办处分。接管组代表办公室主任于寿康，系与陈雷同时到厂工作，对工厂检查不严，应给予记过处分。经理李公达及兼代表张方，均非直接领导化验室工作者，且二人到职不久，失火前一日又因公赴津，并未在场，责任较轻；但事前疏于领导防范，亦应予以批评。至于本府企业部在领导上对预防意外曾有通令指示，但缺乏组织检查，应于部内开展检讨，惩前毖后，吸取经验教训，以指导改进全区的工厂管理工作。
    乙、晋怀曾为肇事的直接负责人，虽无材料证明其为有意行为，但工作一贯不负责，玩忽职守，实为肇事之主要原因，决非一时疏忽失慎，应予撤职处分，并交法院究办。小工赵晋基值夜班睡觉，违犯工作纪律，酿成巨灾，但事后努力抢救，可稍补过，从轻处理，予以开除；在晋怀曾讯究期间，暂勿离厂，以待法庭传问质证。
    丙、消防队巡逻员王延世，负责化验室地区巡逻，一小时值班时间竟睡四十余分钟，以致未能及早发现火警，酿成巨灾，应予开除。消防队长冉书元，平日工作不力，准备太差，对队员管理不严，致临事仓皇无能，损失加重，应予撤职处分。
    丁、工人保卫队员刘良、张连、梁占如、贾士林，自觉的保卫工厂，奋勇抢救，爱护人民财产，应予通令嘉奖。其他积极救火员工亦应由该厂分别给予奖励。
    根据石景山钢铁厂此次失火案件，我们应领取以下之经验教训：
    甲、我区自各大城市解放后，各地仓库工厂屡酿火灾，总结经验教训，以之进行教育不够，且未严格查究责任，以致尚未普遍引起主管干部之严重警惕，这是今后应严重注意者。其次从反动统治接收来的生产企业，不打乱原有机构，在接管初期是对的，但不力求尽可能迅速地对其官僚主义的组织与作风加以整顿改造，是不对的。
    乙、根据该厂及过去其他各厂屡次失火事件看来，原因虽有种种，但主要由于工作人员对人民财产的保管，缺乏应有的责任心。今后必须加强公营企业管理人员的政治教育，这是基本的问题；但亦须辅之以严明的赏罚，才能进一步地提高警惕性。因此，必须对违法渎职人员给以适当处罚，对经营管理有功者，给以表扬奖励。
    丙、该厂失火亦说明许多负责干部对较大企业的管理还缺乏经验。既不善于运用军事管理监督生产的政策，而虚心学习科学管理的精神亦差；更不善依靠和团结工人群众，以监督工厂；对整顿纪律和周密布置保卫工作忽视与麻痹，因而细密地防特、防空、防盗等工作，异常疏忽，所以不断发生事故。为此必须由上级领导机关加强工作检查，总结及交流经验，以迅速克服经营管理上的严重缺点。该厂失火后，由于领导上抓的较紧，已引起该厂职员和工人的警惕，普遍进行自下而上的检讨，提出很多改进意见，证明只要领导上注意，缺点是可以逐渐克服的。
    丁、该厂职工对化验室的损失均很痛惜，在各种会议上一致要求追查责任，对代表、经理、厂长领导上提出很多意见，对财产管理及劳动纪律提供很多方法，证明该厂广大职工是真正积极爱护工厂的，问题是领导上愿不愿意全心全意去依靠工人。只有与职工群众一起，才能开展护厂运动，进行有效的保卫防范工作。该厂此次开展自下而上的批评与自我批评，清算了干部的官僚主义作风，揭露工作的缺点，力求改进，这是很好的现象。只要我们善于发动全体职员工人群众来共同管理生产，并严格执行各种制度，一切困难和灾难是可以克服与避免的。
    仰各公营企业机关、工厂、仓库，一体根据该厂失火情形及经验教训，深刻讨论，立即检查本部门之管理，改善领导，结合工人群众，深入检查具体工作；并布置防火、防特护厂运动，特别是容易发生危险处所与物品，更应注意；提高对人民财产的责任心，一致为团结全体职员工人改善工厂管理与提高生产而斗争。
