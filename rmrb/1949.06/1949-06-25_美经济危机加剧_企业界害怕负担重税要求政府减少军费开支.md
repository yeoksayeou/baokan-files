　　Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, June 24th: The growing economic difficulties within the United States are forcing entrepreneurs to urge reductions in military and Marshall Plan spending for the next fiscal year. On June 22nd, a delegation representing 25,000 small business owners from Westchester County, New York, testified before the Senate Appropriations Committee, expressing fears that a huge budget would inevitably increase taxes and exacerbate economic difficulties. Mr. Figel, a representative of the Wisconsin Chamber of Commerce, stated that all government expenditures (stipulated at $41.858 billion in Truman's budget proposal), including the Marshall Plan and military appropriations, must be reduced by at least 20 percent.

　　According to a United Press report: The National Association of Manufacturers, the general staff of American monopoly capitalists, also advocated on the 22nd cutting $7 billion from the 1950 national budget to avoid increasing tax burdens and exacerbating the current business recession.

    【新华社北平二十四日电】塔斯社华盛顿讯：美国国内日益增加的经济困难，迫令企业家不得不催促减少下一会计年度的军事和马歇尔计划开支。六月二十二日，纽约州西彻斯特县二万五千个小企业家的代表团在参院拨款委员会作证时，表示害怕巨额的预算必将增高税收和增加经济困难。威斯康星州商会代表费格尔说：政府一切开支（杜鲁门预算案中规定为四百十八亿五千八百万美元），包括马歇尔计划和军备拨款，最少必需减少百分之二十。
    另据合众社讯：美国垄断资本家的总参谋部全国制造家协会亦于二十二日主张削减一九五○年度国家预算七十亿元，以免增加税额而引起目前企业衰退的变本加厉。
