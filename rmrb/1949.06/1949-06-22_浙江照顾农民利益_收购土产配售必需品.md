    Zhejiang Protects Farmers' Interests
    Purchasing Local Products and Rationing Essential Goods
    (Xinhua News Agency, Hangzhou, 21st) Rapeseed, oilseeds, tea and other agricultural products from various parts of Zhejiang Province are now entering the market one after another. In order to enable farmers to exchange the above-mentioned products for essential goods fairly and reasonably, and to reduce the exploitation by private merchants, the Finance and Trade Department of the Hangzhou Military Control Commission has instructed the Zhejiang Native Produce Company to establish institutions in Hangzhou, Cixi, Quzhou, Jiaxing, Weiping and other places in the province to carry out purchases; at the same time, a large amount of rice, cloth, salt, kerosene, matches, paper and other materials are continuously transported to various purchasing locations to supply farmers. In addition to Hangzhou, Cixi, Quzhou, and Jiaxing, which are responsible for distribution by the trade company, the Trade Department and the Industry Department have also jointly established cooperative shops in Weiping, Suian and other places to be responsible for the allocation of goods. After purchasing agricultural products, tea factories and oil material offices in various places fill out sales vouchers, and farmers can purchase necessities from trade companies and cooperative shops with the vouchers. The price is generally lower than the market price.

    浙江照顾农民利益
    收购土产配售必需品
    【新华社杭州二十一日电】浙江省各地的菜籽、油料、茶叶等农产品现已陆继登场。杭州军管会财经部贸易处为使农民能以上述产品公平合理地换得必需品，减少私商中间剥削，特责成浙江土产公司在本省杭州、慈溪、衢州、嘉兴、威坪等地设立机构，进行收购；同时以大量米、布、盐、煤油、火柴、纸张等物资，陆续运往各收购地点，供应农民。除杭州、慈溪、衢州、嘉兴四地由贸易公司负责配售外，贸易处并会同实业处在威坪、遂安等地设立合作商店，负责实物调配工作。各地茶厂及油料部办事处在收购农产品后填给售物凭证，农民即可凭证向贸易公司各合作商店购买必需品，价格一般较市价为低。
