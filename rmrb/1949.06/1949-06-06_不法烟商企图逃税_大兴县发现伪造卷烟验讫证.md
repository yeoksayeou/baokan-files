　　Illegal Tobacco Merchants Attempt Tax Evasion
　　Daxing County Discovers Forged Cigarette Inspection Certificates

　　[Our Newspaper] Recently, cigarette inspection certificates bearing the words "Mongolian League Autonomous Government" were discovered on cigarettes in the Daxing County area of Central Hebei. In response, the Northeast Inner Mongolia Tax Bureau issued a statement clarifying that Inner Mongolia's administrative organization is unified and there is no so-called "Mongolian League Autonomous Government." Furthermore, Inner Mongolia does not have large-scale cigarette manufacturing plants and cannot export cigarettes. Before the promulgation of the monopoly regulations on April 10th of this year, cigarette tax was collected on cigarettes produced in Inner Mongolia, and Inner Mongolia cigarette tax inspection certificates were affixed. Since the implementation of the monopoly regulations, before the new certificates are printed, the original certificates will be stamped with the words "Temporarily Substitute Monopoly Certificate." Based on this, the so-called "Mongolian League Autonomous Government" is clearly an illegal product forged by cigarette merchants to deceive various regions and attempt to evade taxes. Relevant departments in various regions, especially local tax bureaus, should strengthen anti-smuggling efforts. Once these forged inspection certificates and flower certificates bearing the words "Mongolian League Autonomous Government" are discovered, they should be severely investigated and dealt with, and rewards should be given to those who report them.

　　不法烟商企图逃税
  　大兴县发现伪造卷烟验讫证
    【本报讯】冀中大兴县一带，最近发现卷烟上贴有“蒙古联盟自治政府”字样之卷烟验讫证，对此事东北内蒙古税务总局曾来函声明：内蒙古的行政组织统一，并无所谓“蒙古联盟自治政府”之组织，且内蒙并无大规模卷烟制造厂，亦不能向外输出；所制卷烟在本年四月十日专卖条例未公布前征收卷烟税，黏贴内蒙卷烟税验讫证。自专卖条例施行后，于新证未印竣前，则以该证加盖“暂代专卖证”字样。据此，此项所谓“蒙古联盟自治政府”显系卷烟商伪造之非法品，蒙蔽各地，希图逃税，各地有关部门，尤其各地税局应加强缉私工作，一旦发现此项伪造验讫证及有“蒙古联盟自治政府”字样之花证，定予严加追究处理，并给报告人提奖。
