Biography of Comrade Yan Pu

　　Comrade Yan Pu (also known as Yan Daren) was from Wuxi, Jiangsu Province, born into a landlord family. He studied at Shanghai Specialized Normal School, Shanghai University, and Southern University. Influenced by "New Youth," "The Guide," and socialist books, he participated in revolutionary activities. Around the time he joined the Chinese Communist Party in 1925, he was an active participant in the worker and student movements. During the "May 30th" demonstration and speeches in 1925, he was among the first fifteen people arrested. After his release that summer, he accepted the Party's order to return to Wuxi to carry out revolutionary activities, initially serving as secretary of the district committee and later as director of the general affairs department of the General Labor Union. He led the workers' movement and sold his own land to establish "Wuxi Jiangsu Middle School." Comrade Yan Pu served as the principal and led the Teachers' Union. Jiangsu Middle School became an important venue for revolutionary activities for Communist workers and revolutionary intellectuals in Wuxi at the time.

　　After Chiang Kai-shek betrayed the revolution in the "April 12th" Incident, Wuxi, like other places, saw labor unions, peasant associations, and Jiangsu Middle School closed down, and revolutionary elements were subjected to severe white terror and massacres. Comrade Yan Pu then moved to the countryside of Wuxi to lead the armed struggle of peasants against rent and taxes, and was appointed chairman of the Peasant Association. Because Comrade Yan Pu first handed over his land to the peasants, did not collect rent, and led the peasants through countless difficult and dangerous struggles against the Kuomintang's armed "cleansing," Comrade Yan Pu gained the support of the vast number of peasants in the Wuxi, Jiangyin, and Changshu areas. The peasants recognized him as their leader. During the most difficult months (from the winter of 1927 to the summer of the following year), the enemy mobilized many soldiers and police, conducting round-the-clock "suppression" and widespread pursuit. However, the peasants protected Comrade Yan Pu, often transferring him safely from village to village several times a night, evading the pursuing enemy. Comrade Yan Pu was once regarded as a "god" in the eyes of the peasants of Wuxi. Even during the Anti-Japanese War, the peasants of Wuxi still hoped for Comrade Yan Pu's return home, and the Party organization in the Jiangnan Wuxi area raised the banner of "Yan Pu" to organize armed resistance against Japan.

　　Because Comrade Yan Pu was a leader supported by the peasants in the Wuxi area, he was elected as a delegate to the Sixth National Congress of the Communist Party of China. After the conference, he was transferred to the Songpu Special Committee to lead the peasant movement in the Songpu area. When he led the Fengxian peasants to attack the reactionary stronghold of Zhuangjiahang, Comrade Yan Pu personally made several bombs beforehand, and during the attack, he took the lead with weapons in hand. Under his heroic leadership, they finally captured the enemy's stronghold and seized their arms. In 1929, Comrade Yan Pu was transferred to work in the French Concession of Shanghai. He was assigned to conduct trade union activities among rickshaw pullers. Comrade Yan Pu was with the rickshaw pullers day and night, eating with them and sleeping with them on the sidewalks by the roadside at night. Due to his active revolutionary activities, Comrade Yan Pu was arrested in the French Concession of Shanghai in the autumn of 1929. During his more than forty days in custody, he suffered all kinds of torture by French imperialism, including several waterboarding sessions, several electric shocks, and countless whippings and beatings, but Comrade Yan Pu remained heroic and unyielding. Because the police station and the Kuomintang reactionaries did not know that the arrested person was the renowned Yan Pu, Comrade Yan Pu was released after his brother gave the reactionaries some bribes. However, after this torture, Comrade Yan Pu's health suffered serious damage. Shortly after his release, Comrade Yan Pu was transferred to the Songjiang Central County Committee and served as Secretary of the Qingpu County Committee. After more than a year, he was transferred to serve as Secretary of the Southern Zhejiang Military Commission and Political Commissar of the 15th Red Army due to the development of the peasant struggle in southern Zhejiang, participating in the battle to attack Wenzhou.

　　In the winter of 1931, the Shanghai Party organization was severely damaged, and Comrade Yan Pu was transferred to the Shanghai leading organs to work in cover agencies. During this period, he was cautious and careful in his work day and night until a large number of leading comrades in Shanghai were safely transferred to the Jiangxi Central Soviet Area, after which Comrade Yan Pu transferred to work in the Central Soviet Area. In the Central Soviet Area, he initially worked for the Xinquan Trading Company. During the Fujian Incident in 1934, he was sent to Fuzhou as a commercial representative of the Soviet area. After returning to the Soviet area, he served as Deputy Minister of the National Economic Department. Later, he participated in the Long March of the Red Army. During the Long March, he was often ill, but when the Party found livestock for him to ride, he always gave the livestock to other comrades and walked step by step with a cane. When the Long March reached northern Guizhou and southern Sichuan, Comrade Yan Pu was too ill to walk any further, and the Party decided that Comrade Yan Pu would be transferred to Chongqing Yichang via the guerrilla隊in southern Sichuan to serve as a transportation station. Soon after, the Shanghai Party sent him to study in the Soviet Union. He returned to China in 1938 and successively served as the Section Chief of the Second Section of the Organization Department of the Central Committee in Yan'an, the Secretary-General and Section Chief of the Second Section of the Eighth Route Army Office in Xi'an and Chongqing. After Japan surrendered, he was sent to work in the Northeast. This time, he was ordered to go south, but he was hospitalized due to illness. After a long period of treatment, he unfortunately passed away at 14:30 on June 5th, at the age of 52.

　　Comrade Yan Pu devoted his entire life to the liberation of the working people, faithfully and diligently for twenty-five years. In his final moments, he only said one sentence about personal matters, and the rest of his will was full of thoughts about expelling imperialism from China and liberating the whole of China. When he was delirious at the end, he was still shouting "Down with imperialism!" Comrade Yan Pu's will was to strengthen Party education, improve the theoretical level of Party members, and urged his wife and daughters to work and study hard. Comrade Yan Pu's spirit of humility and self-criticism was consistent throughout his life. Even ten hours before his death, he made a self-criticism of individual shortcomings in his work in his will. Comrade Yan Pu also instructed that his body be dissected and studied by pathology experts after his death.

　　Comrade Yan Pu was a very good member of the Communist Party of China. He was hardworking and simple, only knew how to work, did not talk about status, obeyed the organization's assignments, and never bargained about work. The death of Comrade Yan Pu is a loss to the Chinese revolution. As the Chinese people's liberation cause is about to achieve complete victory, Comrade Yan Pu has passed away, but his iron will and the revolutionary spirit of unyielding struggle will last forever.

　　严朴同志传略
    严朴同志（又名严达人）江苏无锡人，出身于地主家庭，曾肄业上海专科师范、上海大学、南方大学。受“新青年”、“向导”及社会主义书籍的影响，参加革命活动，一九二五年加入中国共产党前后，曾是积极参加工人学生运动者。一九二五年“五卅”游行讲演时，是最初被捕的十五人中之一。当年夏，释出后，接受党的命令，回无锡进行革命活动，初任地委秘书，后任总工会总务部长，领导工人运动，并变卖自己的田产创办“无锡江苏中学”，严朴同志兼校长，并领导教员联合会，江苏中学成为当时无锡共产党职工与革命知识分子的革命活动的重要场所。
    “四一二”蒋介石叛变革命，无锡与其他地方一样，工会农会和江苏中学都遭封闭，革命分子遭到严重的白色恐怖的屠杀，严朴同志即转入无锡乡村，领导农民抗租抗税的武装斗争，被任为农协委员长。由于严朴同志首先把自己的土地交给农民，不收地租，并在反对国民党的武装清乡中领导农民经历过无数次困难危险斗争，因此严朴同志取得无锡江阴常熟一带广大农民的拥护，农民承认他是自己的领袖。在环境最恶劣的几个月中（一九二七年冬至次年夏），敌人调集了许多军警，日夜“清剿”，四处追捕，但农民保卫严仆同志，常常是一夜之间敌人追捕好几次，但每次被农民把严朴同志一村一村的安全转送，避开了追捕的敌人。严朴同志曾经是无锡农民的心目中的“神仙”。即在抗战时期，无锡农民还盼望着严朴同志回家，当时江南无锡一带的党组织就打着“严朴”的旗号，组织起抗日的武装。
    由于严朴同志是无锡一带农民拥护的领袖，故他被推为出席中国共产党第六次全国代表大会的代表，会后调任松浦特委，领导松浦一带的农民运动，当他领导奉贤农民攻打反动堡垒庄家行时，严朴同志事前亲手制造了若干炸弹，攻击时手执武器，率先冲锋。在他的英勇领导之下，终于攻下了敌人的据点，收缴了敌人的武装。一九二九年，严朴同志调任上海法南区工作，他被分配在黄包车夫中进行工会活动，严朴同志日夜与黄包车夫在一起，吃饭与黄包车夫在一起吃，晚上就与黄包车夫一起睡在路边的人行道上。由于他积极的革命活动，一九二九年秋，严朴同志在上海法租界被捕，在被捕的四十余天中，受尽法国帝国主义的酷刑，灌了几次冷水，受了几次电刑，皮鞭、踢打不知其数，但严朴同志始终英勇不屈。由于捕房及国民党反动派不知道被捕的是赫赫有名的严朴，所以经过严朴同志的哥哥给反动派以若干贿赂之后，严朴同志即被释出，但经过这次酷刑之后，严朴同志的健康受了严重的损害，出狱不久，严朴同志调任松江中心县委并任青浦县委书记，年余后，因浙南农民斗争开展，又被调任浙南军委书记，兼红十五军政治委员，参加进攻温州之役。
    一九三一年冬，上海党组织遭到严重的破坏，严朴同志被调到上海领导机关担任掩护机关的工作。在此期内，日夜谨慎小心于自己的工作直到大批上海领导同志安全转入江西中央苏区之后，严朴同志才转到中央苏区工作。在中央苏区，初任新泉贸易公司工作。一九三四年福建事变时，被派驻福州为苏区商业代表。回苏区后，任国民经济部副部长。后即参加红军长征，在长征途中身体是常病的，可是当党一两次给他找到牲口代步时，他总是把牲口让给别的同志，自己拿着一根拐杖，一步一步的步行。长征到达黔北川南时，因为严朴同志身体病得无法再走了，党决定严朴同志经过川南游击队转送至重庆宜昌，担任组织交通站的工作。不久被上海党派赴苏联学习。一九三八年回国，历任延安中央组织部二科长，西安重庆八路军办事处秘书长、二科长等职务。日本投降后，派赴东北工作。此次奉命南下，因病留住医院，久治无效，不幸于六月五日十四时三十分病逝，享年五十二岁。
    严朴同志一生为劳动人民的解放事业忠心耿耿，二十五年如一日，在弥留时，关于个人的事情仅仅说了一句话，而其他的遗嘱全是念念不忘于驱逐帝国主义出中国，解放全中国。临终神志不清时，犹在呼喊打倒帝国主义。严朴同志遗嘱加强党内教育，提高党员的理论水平，叮嘱妻女好好工作和学习。严朴同志谦虚和自我批评的精神是始终如一的，临终十小时前尚在遗嘱中作一生工作上个别缺点的自我批评。严朴同志并嘱死后将自己的遗体请病理专家解剖研究。
    严朴同志是中国共产党的很好的党员，他艰苦朴素，只知工作，不讲地位，服从组织的分配，从不在工作上讲价钱。严朴同志的死是中国革命的一个损失。当着中国人民解放事业就要全部胜利的时候，严朴同志死去了，但他钢铁般的意志，奋斗不屈的革命精神是永存不朽的。
