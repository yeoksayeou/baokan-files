　　Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 27th: TASS reports: On the eve of the opening of the Second Congress of the World Federation of Trade Unions, Saillant, Secretary-General of the World Federation of Trade Unions, met with a reporter from the French newspaper L'Humanité and announced that trade union delegations from over forty countries around the world, as well as observers from the trade unions of the United States, Britain, and Belgium, would attend this Congress.

　　When listing the countries that would send representatives to the congress, Saillant stated: Representatives from the trade unions of China, Japan, North Korea, South Korea, Mongolia, Vietnam, the Philippines, Indonesia, Ceylon, India, and Pakistan will arrive from Asia and the Far East.

　　European countries sending representatives to the congress include trade union delegations from the Soviet Union, Poland, Finland, Germany (from all four occupation zones), the Netherlands, Luxembourg, France, Italy, Republican Spain, Czechoslovakia, Yugoslavia, Hungary, Romania, and Bulgaria. The trade unions of Great Britain and the trade unions of Belgium have decided to send observers to the congress.

　　Delegations from North and South America attending the congress include trade union delegations from Canada, the United States (observers), Mexico, Guatemala, Uruguay, Colombia, Ecuador, Brazil, Chile, Cuba, and Venezuela.

　　The delegations representing North Africa at the congress will be from Tunisia, Algeria, and Morocco. The trade unions of the Union of South Africa, Southern Rhodesia, and Nigeria, as well as trade union organizations in French Equatorial Africa and French West Africa, will also send representatives to the congress.

　　Saillant stated: I can add that delegations from the trade unions of Australia, Lebanon, and Cyprus will participate in the congress. Trade unions from Israel and Arab countries have also stated that they will participate in the congress.

　　Saillant continued: Until now, the Italian government has refused to issue entry visas to the Chinese delegation and has not yet notified us of its refusal to issue Italian entry visas to trade union delegations from other countries. Negotiations on the issuance of visas are ongoing. Eighteen representatives from the Japanese trade unions are still in Tokyo because the American occupation authorities are attempting to prevent them from traveling to Milan.
