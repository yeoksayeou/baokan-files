Bulgarian Trade Unions Strive to Fulfill the Five-Year Plan
By Damyanov
Translated by Liu Shirong

The Fifth Congress of the Bulgarian Communist Party adopted a five-year plan for the development of the national economy. This plan presents a clear vision and lays the foundation for our country to build socialism, outlining concrete measures.

The Bulgarian Trade Unions must, and are, wholeheartedly engaged in the struggle to fulfill the five-year plan. To this end, every possible effort is being made to increase productivity.

The main determining factor of labor productivity is people—workers, engineers, and technicians. It relies on their ability to use machines, maximize their production capacity, and improve organizational work.

Special training classes to improve workers' skills, promoted by the trade unions, have been set up across the country. For example, in Gabrovo there are twenty-seven such training classes, training five hundred and thirty-two workers; in Sofia there are sixty training classes, with two thousand one hundred workers; and in Varna there are sixty-seven training classes, with two thousand workers.

In the struggle to increase labor productivity, trade unions are assisting in improving the organization of production, encouraging and promoting improvements and rationalization. In this regard, workers are willing to support us; thousands of rationalization proposals have been put forward in factories, aimed at exceeding planned targets through improved production methods. Here is a typical example: Comrade Pennov of Factory No. 12 was given a deadline to produce five hundred induction coils for automobiles. To complete the task, he made some adjustments to the machine, enabling it to produce three coils in the time it previously took to make one. In this way, he completed the plan ahead of schedule.

Because workers, engineers, and technicians are working in this way to increase labor productivity, it has been possible to adopt new working methods and better methods of organizing production. The group of Comrades Vidinov and Vakrinov of Factory No. 12 increased production by 130% over the plan by improving labor organization. The cyclical system is now used in the Polnik coal mine, and collective mining is used on a larger scale. As a result, labor productivity in the Maritza River coal mine has increased by 20%.

The number of people using collective looms is also increasing. For example, in the Marida textile factory, 62% of the workers operate multiple looms simultaneously. The trade unions promote the widespread adoption of the working methods of outstanding workers by commending them.

Socialist competition is a major factor in developing labor productivity, which is why the Bulgarian Trade Unions, in the struggle for the victorious completion of the five-year plan, pay special attention to organizing and developing competition.

Our trade unions have gained considerable experience and many victories in organizing and guiding the competition movement.

The trade union committee of the Kuranov rubber factory organizes competition in the following way: The trade union committee and the factory director and technical heads discuss the factory's plan, dividing it into quarters, months, weeks, and days. Then it is discussed at the workers' congress, and measures to complete the plan are adopted. The workers form groups to compete with each other. Daily work inspections allow workers to know who is leading in production. Achievements are discussed at monthly meetings, and new tasks are proposed. The factory organizes production in this way and exceeded the task by 30% in 1948.

However, some trade unions take a formalistic attitude towards the issue of competition. They routinely confine themselves to discussing the factory's plan at the congress, and after formulating the competition pledge, they ignore it. Naturally, the results are far from satisfactory. We are waging a relentless struggle against formalism in organizing competition, so that all trade union organizations actively participate.

The improvement of product quality is a major symbol of socialist competition. The Central Committee of the Bulgarian Trade Unions pointed out how important it is for trade unions to strive for high-quality production, and emphasized that trade unions that do not pay attention to this, and workers who produce inferior products, are wasting valuable materials and harming the national economy.

One of the basic tasks put forward by Comrade Dimitrov at the Fifth Congress of the Communist Party, regarding the establishment of a socialist economic and cultural foundation in our country, is the adoption of new socialist labor discipline.

The trade unions can only accomplish the above tasks by carrying out extensive explanatory work among the workers, helping to curb absenteeism and laxity in labor, and helping to make the most of every working day. In the struggle for the five-year plan, many trade unions have made progress in this regard. But what has been achieved is only an insignificant part of the work to be done. Strict socialist labor discipline is and will continue to be one of the main tasks of the trade unions.

The trade unions also face the task of helping the countryside. Trade unions in metal forging, transportation, electrical, and other industries are sending technical teams to the countryside to help agricultural cooperatives and tractor stations repair agricultural machinery. Local trade union committees provide direct assistance to the people's congresses in organizing technical teams. Agricultural workers and agricultural experts, rural teachers and staff actively explain in the countryside what needs to be done during the spring plowing, and encourage the application of progressive farming methods.

The workers help the countryside with the spring plowing plan, strengthening the ties with the working peasants and ensuring the achievement of the first year's goals of the five-year plan.

The realization of the five-year plan is inextricably linked with the improvement of the material life of the working class and the people. The first achievements of this year's five-year plan will be obvious.

Large-scale housing construction has begun in the Polnik mines, Dimitrovgrad, Sofia, Gabrovo, Pleven, Haskovo, and other cities. Thousands of workers will move into new homes this year. Canteens are being built in many factories, vegetable gardens are being planted, and pastures are being organized. As stipulated in the five-year plan, the trade unions are organizing public management of social measures to improve the health of workers.

Our trade unions are studying the doctrine of Marxism-Leninism as a guide to their work. A one-year trade union school has been opened in Sofia, and almost all of the central leading organs of trade unions and trade union federations are running cadre training classes. Regular three-month training classes will be opened this year in Sofia, Plovdiv, and Varna.

Training classes and discussion groups for activists are being organized to study Marxism-Leninism, the experience of Soviet socialist construction, Comrade Dimitrov's report, and the resolutions of the Fifth Congress of the Communist Party. Workers' universities have been opened in Sofia and Plovdiv. Meetings are held in factories and organizations to explain the issues of proletarian internationalism and the struggle against nationalism to the workers, to educate them in the spirit of strong friendship with the people of the Soviet Union and the new democratic countries.

The five-year plan will lay the socialist foundation for our country. The struggle to realize the five-year plan is an important and glorious task for the trade unions. The Bulgarian working people, united in the trade unions, will do everything possible to make the five-year plan a success.

    保加利亚职工会为实现五年计划而奋斗
    丹姆扬诺夫著
    刘诗嵘译
    保加利亚共产党第五次代表大会为发展国民经济，通过了一个五年计划。这计划，提示了一副清晰的远景，并为我们国家奠定社会主义的基础，规划出具体的措施。
    保加利亚职工会必需、而且正在全神贯注于实现五年计划的斗争上。为了这个目的，正在尽一切可能来提高生产力。
    劳动生产力的主要决定因素是人——工人、工程师、和技师。依靠他们的能力，来运用机器，尽量发挥机器的生产能力，并改善组织工作。
    为改进工人技术的特别训练班，在职工会的推动下遍设全国。例如在加布洛夫有二十七个这样的训练班，训练着五百三十二个工人；索非亚有六十个训练班，二千一百个工人；瓦尔纳有六十七个训练班，二千工人。
    在为提高劳动生产力的奋斗中，职工会正协助改进生产的组织，鼓励并推行改良与合理化。在这一方面，工人是愿意支持我们的；在工厂中提出了数千合理化的建议，其目的在于通过改良的生产方法以超过计划的目标。这儿有一个典型的例子：限期要十二号工厂的彭诺夫同志造好五百个汽车上的感应线轴。为了完成任务，他对机器做了若干调整，使以前制造一个线轴的时间内能造三个。这样他提前完成了计划。
    因为工人、工程师、和技师都这样工作，来提高劳动生产力，已经可能采用新的工作方法和更好的组织生产的方法。十二号工厂的卫狄诺夫同志和瓦克里诺夫同志的小组，以改进劳动组织增加了生产量，超过计划百分之一百三十。现在波尔聂克的煤矿采用循环制，更大规模的采用集体开采制。结果马利蒂河煤矿的劳动生产力提高了百分之二十。
    使用集体织机的人也在增加。例如，在马利达纺织厂就有百分之六十二的工人同时运用许多织机。职工会以表扬优秀工人的工作方法，使他们的经验得以普遍推行。
    社会主义竞赛是发展劳动生产力的一个主要因素，这就是为什么在为胜利完成五年计划而奋斗的保加利亚职工会，特别注意组织发展竞赛。
    我们的工会在组织指导竞赛运动中，已获得相当的经验和很多的胜利。
    库拉诺夫橡胶工厂的职工会委员会以如下的方式组织竞赛：职工会委员会和工厂的厂长及技术首脑讨论工厂的计划，将它分为季、月、周、和日。然后在工人大会上讨论，并通过完成计划的措施。工人们组成小组互相比赛。每日的工作检查，使工人知道谁在生产上领先。在每月会议上讨论成绩，提出新的任务。该厂以这种方式组织生产，一九四八年超过任务百分之三十。
    然而，有些职工会对竞赛的问题采取形式化的态度。他们照例将自己局限于在大会上讨论工厂的计划，制订了竞赛誓约后就不管了。自然结果大不圆满。我们对组织竞赛中的形式主义正进行无情的斗争，要使各职工会机构都积极地参加进来。
    产品质的改进，是社会主义竞赛的一个主要标帜。保加利亚职工会中央委员会指出职工会为高等品质的生产而奋斗是何等的重要，并强调对此不注意的职工会与造出劣等产品的工人，都是浪费宝贵的材料和有害于国民经济。
    季米特洛夫同志在共产党第五次代表大会上提出的、有关在我们国家建立社会主义的经济文化基础的基本任务之一，是采用新的社会主义的劳动纪律。
    职工会只有在工人中间进行广泛的解释工作，协助制止旷工和劳动的散漫性，协助尽量使用每一工日，这样才能完成上述任务。在五年计划的斗争中，许多职工会在这方面已获进步。但所做到的只不过是要做的工作的不重要的一部份而已。严格社会主义的劳动纪律是并将继续是职工会的主要任务之一。
    职工会还面临着帮助乡村的任务。金属锻冶、运输、电气，和其它工业的职工会，正派遣技术小组到乡间去帮助农业合作社和拖拉机站修理农作器械。地方职工会委员会在组织技术小组中，给人民会议以直接的帮助。农业工人和农业专家、乡村教师和职员在乡间积极地解说在春耕时需要作什么，和鼓励应用进步的耕种方法。
    工人以春耕计划来帮助乡村，加强了与劳动农民的连系，保证达到五年计划的第一年的目标。
    实现五年计划与改进工人阶级和人民的物质生活是不可分的连系着。今年五年计划的第一批成绩，将是显而易见的。
    在波尔聂克矿山、季米特洛夫格勒、索非亚、加布洛夫、普利温、赫斯考夫和其它城市，开始了大规模的房屋建筑。成千的工人今年将移入新居。正在许多工厂中修起食堂，开始种菜园，牧场也正在组织。为五年计划中所规定的，职工会正组织对社会措施的公共管理，来改进职工的保健。
    我们的职工会正学习马列主义的学说，做为工作的指南。一个一年制的职工会学校已在索非亚开办，几乎所有职工会和总工会的中央领导机构都在开办干部训练班。经常的三个月的训练班，今年将在索非亚、普洛夫狄夫和瓦尔纳开办。
    正在组织积极分子的训练班和讨论小组，以学习马列主义，苏联社会主义建设的经验，季米特洛夫同志的报告，和共产党第五次代表大会的决议。工人大学已在索非亚和普洛夫狄夫开办。在工厂和机关开会，将无产阶级的国际主义和对民族主义的斗争问题，向工人们讲解，以与苏联和新民主国家人民的坚强友谊的精神教育他们。
    五年计划将为我们国家奠定社会主义的基础。为实现五年计划而奋斗是职工会一个重要和光荣的任务。团结在职工会里的保加利亚劳动人民，将以全力使五年计划得到成功。  （译自一九四九年三月一日“争取持久和平与人民民主”半月刊第五期。）
