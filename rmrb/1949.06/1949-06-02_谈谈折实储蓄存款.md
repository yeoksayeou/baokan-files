　　Discussing Value-Guaranteed Savings Deposits
　　Cheng Renjie
　　In the spirit of serving the people, the People's Bank of China promotes thrift and rewards the laboring people, intellectuals, people from all walks of life, and social organizations such as government agencies, factories, and schools for their savings. Therefore, it has launched value-guaranteed savings deposit services to absorb a large amount of floating capital and invest it in planned ways in productive enterprises that benefit the national economy and the people's livelihoods, in order to accelerate the development of the New Democratic economy.
　　The value-guaranteed deposits currently available include fixed deposit lump sum withdrawal, zero deposit lump sum withdrawal, fixed deposit periodic withdrawal, and deposit principal with interest payment. The calculation method is based on the "standard commodity unit," which includes one *jin* of flour, one *jin* of corn flour (or millet), and one *chi* of cloth. The prices are based on the average retail prices of these three items as published in the local newspapers for the five days prior (for example, if the average retail price of flour is 100 yuan per *jin* for the previous five days, the average retail price of corn flour is 60 yuan per *jin*, and the average retail price of cloth is 120 yuan per *chi*, then the price of one "standard commodity unit" is 280 yuan). When depositors deposit currency into the bank, the bank converts the amount deposited into a number of "standard commodity units" according to the "standard commodity unit" price at that time. When withdrawing funds at maturity, the bank converts the number of "standard commodity units" at the time of deposit into currency for repayment according to the "standard commodity unit" price at the time of withdrawal. In addition, interest is paid on the amount of currency deposited at the time of deposit according to the type and duration of the value-guaranteed deposit. In this way, the majority of depositors can not only obtain general deposit interest but also avoid the loss of currency devaluation due to rising prices. It is precisely because our value-guaranteed deposits are based on safeguarding the interests of the broad masses of the people that they have been welcomed and praised by people from all walks of life, especially the laboring people, since their inception, although it has not been long. Employees of government agencies, factories, and schools, as well as the broad masses of the people, have actively saved their surplus funds and deposited them in banks. The savings business has developed more rapidly in Shijiazhuang, Beijing, and Tianjin. For example, in Beijing, from April 1st to the end of April, in one month, more than 26.5 million yuan was received in deposits, with 1,635 depositors. In Tianjin, from March 1st to the end of April, in two months, more than 47.16 million yuan was received in deposits, with 4,568 depositors. In Shijiazhuang, from early March to the end of April, more than 70.39 million yuan was received in deposits, with 1,781 depositors. The total deposits in the above three places amounted to 144.05 million yuan, with 7,984 depositors. In other savings branches such as Changzhi, Handan, Jinan, Tangshan, and Yangquan, although the amount of deposits received is relatively small, it has laid a favorable foundation for future development of the savings business.
　　Value-guaranteed savings deposits are of a rewarding nature. This value-guaranteed calculation method greatly takes care of the interests of depositors in times of price fluctuations. However, state-owned banks that accept deposits inevitably have to bear some losses as a result. Especially during price increases, state-owned banks absorb a large amount of floating capital to stabilize prices and stop lending to the outside world. Although the bank suffers some losses as a result, it gains greater benefits, namely the restoration of price stability. State-owned banks should try to avoid unnecessary losses as much as possible when running value-guaranteed savings deposits. Therefore, the deposit period has certain restrictions (such as fixed deposit lump sum withdrawal for at least three months, fixed deposit periodic withdrawal and zero deposit lump sum withdrawal for at least six months) and must be stipulated in advance; to prevent speculators from using value-guaranteed savings to speculate in price fluctuations. As for current deposits, the bank has other regulations and cannot adopt value-guaranteed methods.

　　谈谈折实储蓄存款
    程人杰
    中国人民银行本着为人民服务的精神、提倡节约、奖励劳动人民、知识分子、社会各界人士，及机关、工厂、学校等社会团体之储蓄。因此举办折实储蓄业务，以便大量吸收游资，并将这些游资有计划的投入到对国计民生有利的生产事业中去，以加速新民主主义经济的发展。
    此种折实存款现已举办的共有整存整付，零存整付，整存零付，存本付息四种。其计算方法是按“标准实物单位”计算，这种“标准实物单位”包括面粉一市斤、玉米面（或小米）一市斤，布一市尺三种物品，其价格均以当地报纸公布之前五日平均零售物价为准，（如当地前五日面粉每斤平均零售价格为一百元，玉米面每斤平均价格为六十元，布每尺平均价格为一百二十元，则一个“标准实物单位”的价格即为二百八十元）。存款人将货币存入银行时，银行即将所存货币数量按当时“标准实物单位”价格折成若干“标准实物单位”。期满提款时，银行则按存入时之“标准实物单位”数量，以及提款时之“标准实物单位”价格折成货币偿付，此外并按折实存款的类别及时间长短，以存入时的货币数量计算付息。这样广大存款户不但可以获得一般的存款利息，而且可以免受物价上涨中货币贬值的损失。正由于我们的折实存款，是以维护广大人民的利益出发的。所以自创办以来，虽为时不久，但已得到了社会各阶层人士特别是劳动人民之欢迎与赞许，各地机关工厂学校的职工以及广大人民，纷纷节出余资送行储蓄，尤其是石家庄北平天津三地，储存较为发展。如北平自四月一日至四月底，一个月时间收到存款二千六百五十万余元，计有存户一千六百三十五户，天津自三月一日至四月底，两个月时间收到存款四千七百十六万余元，计有存户四千五百六十八户，石家庄自三月上旬至四月底收到存款七千零三十九万余元，计有存户一千七百八十一户，以上三地共计存款一亿四千万元，存户七千九百八十四户。其他如长治、邯郸、济南、唐山、阳泉等储蓄部，收到之存款数额虽较少，但已为今后发展储蓄业务打下了有利的基础。
    折实储蓄存款是带有奖励性质的，这种折实计算的办法在物价波动中，大大的照顾了存户的利益，但接受存款的国家银行，是不得不因此而忍受若干损失的。尤其在物价上涨中，国家银行为着平稳物价，大量吸收社会游资，停止向外贷放。这样银行虽受若干损失，但因此而换来了更大的利益，即物价的恢复平稳。国家银行在举办折实储蓄存款中，应该尽可能地避免不必要的损失。因此存款时期有一定的限制（如整存整付至少三个月，整存零付及零存整付至少六个月）且须预先规定；以免投机商人在物价波动中利用折实储蓄来进行投机。至于活期存款，银行另有规定，不能采用折实办法。
