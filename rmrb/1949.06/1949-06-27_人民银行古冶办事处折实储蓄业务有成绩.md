　　People's Bank of Guye Office Achieves Success in Indexed Savings Business
    [Our Newspaper News] The People's Bank of Guye Office has achieved good results in carrying out indexed savings work in Linxi. Because of in-depth publicity and mobilization, it has achieved very good results. In order to attract worker depositors in the mine, the office conducted publicity through various meetings and written materials at the beginning of the business, but because of the complexity of production units such as above-ground and underground in the mine, and the different working hours, the publicity work was difficult and the effect was not great. Based on this situation, it later started from the workers' residential area, initially opening up the thinking of the street cadres, obtaining the help of the women's committee members and group leaders, and holding group meetings of workers' families to conduct publicity and explanation, and directly handling savings procedures. From the 11th to the 18th, in eight days, a total of 589 worker depositors, 697 units, 60 staff depositors, 283 units, and 114 other depositors, 210 units, were absorbed.
    The advantage of this working method is that it is more in-depth, allowing workers to know the benefits of indexed savings. The workers all reflected, "It's great to do it this way. We used to think that banks wouldn't let us deposit if we had little money, but now we know that even one unit can be deposited, and it's very convenient. We must save a little money to deposit every month in the future, so that we can accumulate a sum of money."

　　人民银行古冶办事处折实储蓄业务有成绩
    【本报讯】人民银行古冶办事处在林西开展折实储蓄工作，因为深入宣传动员，获得很好的成绩。该处为吸收矿内工人存户，在开始办理时曾通过各种会议及文字宣传，但因矿内井上井下等生产单位复杂，和工作时间的不同，宣传工作困难，所收效果不大。根据这种情形，以后便从工人住宅区作起，初步是打通了街干部的思想，取得妇女委员与组长们的帮助，分组召开工人家属会议，进行宣传解释，并直接办理储蓄手续。从十一日到十八日的八天中，共吸收了工人存款五八九户，六九七个单位，职员六十户，二八三个单位，其他一一四户，二一○个单位。
    这种工作方式的优点是比较深入，使工人知道折实储蓄的好处，工人们都反映说：“这样办太好了，从前我们以为钱少银行不让存，现在可知道了连一个单位也可以存，而且很方便，以后一定要每月节省点钱去存，将来可以积成一笔整钱。”
