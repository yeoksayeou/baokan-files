Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 18th. Shanghai Liberation Daily published an editorial on the 15th entitled "Eliminating Bandits and Special Agents, Maintaining Public Security," pointing out that the Shanghai Military Control Commission and the Songhu Garrison Command have issued various announcements related to maintaining public security for several consecutive days. Director Chen Yi also convened meetings with military police and civil affairs departments to decide on specific measures for maintaining public security. The People's Government will actively safeguard the freedom and safety of the city's people and thoroughly eliminate the activities of Kuomintang special agents and bandit gangs who disrupt social order. The editorial pointed out that after the liberation of Shanghai, the remaining forces of the lurking Kuomintang reactionaries, facing the torrent of new life and progress of the Shanghai people, have felt the coming of their doom. Therefore, they are carrying out various sabotage activities, robbery, violence, and murder, attacking residents, provoking labor-capital disputes, and creating rumors, attempting to undermine the people's trust in the People's Government, create chaos, and facilitate their lurking. The editorial said: "We dare to assert that these destructive activities of the Kuomintang reactionaries will not only fail to achieve their goals but will also accelerate their own demise." The editorial said: The Kuomintang reactionaries mistake the leniency of the People's Government as a sign of weakness, and they still believe that the situation in Shanghai is complex and that they can continue to lurk. The Kuomintang reactionaries are completely wrong. The editorial pointed out that the Kuomintang reactionaries' more than 20 years of heinous anti-people rule have been shattered, and the Kuomintang reactionaries have been abandoned by the people, saying: "The Chinese Communist Party and the Chinese People's Liberation Army have won the support of the people nationwide and hold powerful revolutionary power; in the nearly thirty years of long struggle, they know how to master and use various organizational forms and various forms of struggle; they have tried various difficulties and can overcome them smoothly, and ultimately defeat the enemy. In particular, it can maintain close unity with people from all walks of life with a humble attitude of learning. To complete the task of managing this big city of Shanghai is not a problem; to eliminate the lurking activities of bandits and special agents is even less of a problem." The editorial then pointed out that maintaining social order should address the unemployment problem caused by the political and economic bankruptcy in China for decades. This serious social problem, under the new historical situation of Shanghai's liberation and the upcoming national liberation, under the leadership of the People's Government, has the possibility of being solved. Naturally, this cannot be solved in one morning; it must be patiently and carefully carried out for long-term transformation work. The editorial specifically explained: A part of the scattered soldiers and stragglers can stay in the People's Liberation Army, be educated and transformed, and a part can be sent back to their hometowns for employment. Hundreds of thousands of refugees in the war will be sent back to their original places and notified to the local people's government for proper resettlement. Those who have committed crimes and mistakes, as long as they are willing to repent and start anew, can be treated with leniency. The unemployment problem in Shanghai will be gradually resolved in the development of production. For those who cannot find employment for the time being, appropriate relief and appropriate dispersal will be provided. In this way, the unemployment problem in Shanghai will be gradually solved, so that the Kuomintang bandits and special agents will no longer have any loopholes to exploit.
    The editorial finally pointed out that in order to implement various public security measures, it is necessary to resolutely suppress the ringleaders and resolutely suppress robbers. These criminals will never be tolerated and never be condoned.

　　肃清匪特维持治安
  　上海解放日报社论
    【新华社上海十八日电】上海解放日报十五日发表题为“肃清匪特维持治安”的社论，指出上海市军管会和淞沪警备司令部已连日发布各种有关维持治安的布告，陈毅主任并召集军警及民政方面开会决定维持治安的具体办法，人民政府将积极保障全市人民的自由与安全，彻底肃清国民党特务匪帮破坏社会秩序的活动。社论指出上海在解放以后潜伏的国民党反动派的残余势力，在上海人民的新生前进的洪流面前，已经感到末日的来临，因此施展各种破坏活动，抢劫暴杀，袭击居民，挑拨劳资纠纷，制造谣言等，企图以此破坏人民对人民政府的信任，造成混乱，便利他们的潜伏。社论说：“我们敢断定国民党反动派这些破坏活动，不仅达不到目的，而且是加速自己的灭亡。”社论说：国民党反动派把人民政府的宽大错以为是示弱，他们还以为上海情况复杂，可以让他们潜伏下去。国民党反动派是完全想错了。社论在指出国民党反动派二十余年罪大恶极的反人民的统治已被打得落花流水，国民党反动派已被人民所唾弃之后说：“中国共产党人、中国人民解放军获得全国人民的拥护，手中掌握着强大的革命权力；在将近三十年的长期奋斗中，各种组织形式，各种斗争形式，均懂得掌握，均懂得运用；各种困难，均曾尝试过，均能顺利克服，最终战胜敌人。特别是它能以虚心学习的态度，与各阶层人民保持亲密的团结。要完成管理上海这个大城市的任务，是不成问题的；要肃清匪特的潜伏活动，更是不成问题的。”社论接着指出维持社会治安应当解决在中国几十年来政治经济破产情况下所引起的失业问题，这一严重的社会问题在上海解放和即将全国解放的新的历史情况下，在人民政府的领导下，已有解决的可能。自然这不是一天早上能够解决的，必须耐心地、仔细地作长期改造工作。社论具体说明：散兵游勇一部可留在解放军中，加以教育改造，一部遣送回籍就业。数十万战争中的难民，均遣回原籍，并通知当地人民政府作妥当安插。其中犯罪与过失分子，只要他们愿意改过自新，则均可以作宽大处理。上海市的失业人员，将在发展生产中逐步解决，对一时无法就业的部分，将作适当救济和适当疏散。这样上海的失业问题逐步解决，就使国民党匪特再无隙可乘。
    社论最后指出，为了贯彻各种治安措施，必须坚决镇压首恶分子，坚决镇压抢劫罪犯。对这些罪犯决不宽容，决不姑息。
