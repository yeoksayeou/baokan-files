　　Strengthening the Internal Organization of the World Federation of Trade Unions

    [Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 14th] Moscow Dispatch: Sai Yang, Secretary-General of the World Federation of Trade Unions, published an article in the Soviet magazine "Trade Unions" entitled "Strengthening the Internal Organization of the World Federation of Trade Unions." The author paid particular attention to the establishment of industrial trade departments within the World Federation of Trade Unions. Sai Yang wrote: "A completely new era will be seen in the international trade union movement." "Truly expanding and improving the activities of the World Federation of Trade Unions is being put on the agenda. In the future, the international relations between trade unions of various countries will not only exist between the central organizations of national trade unions, but will be expanded and thus will receive reliable support from the industrial trade departments; the industrial trade departments belonging to the World Federation of Trade Unions will guarantee close contact between national trade unions of various major industries internationally. We are moving in the direction of strengthening our entire trade union movement and consolidating the internal strength of the World Federation of Trade Unions." Sai Yang continued: After the upcoming Second Congress of the World Federation of Trade Unions, the founding meetings of six international trade departments representing the most important industries will be held – the founding meetings of "Metal Workers," "Textile Workers," "Leather and Leather Goods Workers," "Seafarers and Dockworkers," "Miners," and "Construction Workers, Forestry Workers, and Public Works Workers." The article lists many facts proving that the World Federation of Trade Unions' decision to establish industrial trade departments has received broad support from the working people of all countries. Sai Yang said: This decision has received the best response from the working people of all countries, including within the ranks of the British Trades Union Congress and within the ranks of the American Federation of Labor. The American Pacific Coast Dockworkers Union of the American Federation of Labor recently held a congress, declared its support for the World Federation of Trade Unions, and passed a resolution to participate in the International Seafarers and Dockworkers Conference to be held in Geneva in July. The Canadian Seafarers' Union, which is engaged in the struggle against wage cuts, has directly requested support from the World Federation of Trade Unions. The World Federation of Trade Unions immediately provided support. Despite the decision of some reactionary leaders of the Canadian Trades and Labor Congress to follow the hostile attitude of the American Federation of Labor and the British Trades Union Congress towards the World Federation of Trade Unions, the fact that Canadian seafarers appealed to the World Federation of Trade Unions exposed the unstable position of the splitters in the Canadian Trades and Labor Congress.

　　巩固内部组织的世界工联
    赛扬
    【新华社北平十四日电】莫斯科讯；世界职工联盟总书记赛扬在苏联杂志“职工会”上发表一文，题为“巩固内部组织的世界工联”。作者对于在世界工联以内建立各业职工部的问题，特别注意。赛扬写道：“在国际职工运动上将可看到一个完全崭新的时代的开始。”“真正扩大和提高世界工联的活动，正被提到日程上来。今后，各国职工会的国际间的关系，将不仅存在于各国全国性职工会中央机构之间，而将被扩大并因此将得到各业职工部的可靠的支持；属于世界工联组织之内的各业职工部，将保证国际间各个主要工业的全国性职工会的密切联系。我们正在朝着加强我们整个职工运动和巩固世界工联内部力量的方向前进。”赛扬继称：在即将举行的世界工联第二届代表大会之后，接着将召开六个代表最重要的工业的国际职工部的成立会议——“五金工人”、“纺织工人”、“皮革与皮货业工人”、“海员与码头工人”、“矿工”、“建筑工人、林业工人和公共工程工人”的成立会议。文中列举许多事实，证明世界工联关于建立各业职工部的决定，已受到一切国家劳动人民的广泛支持。赛扬说：这一决定得到一切国家包括英国职工大会队伍以内和美国劳工联合会队伍以内的劳动人民的最良好的响应。美国劳工联合会的美国太平洋海岸码头工人工会最近举行的代表大会，声言支持世界工联；并通过关于参加七月间在日内瓦举行的国际海员和码头工人大会的决议。进行反对减削工资斗争的加拿大海员工会，曾直接向世界工联要求支援。世界工联立即予以支持。尽管加拿大职工大会的若干反动领袖决定追随美国劳联和英国职工大会对世界工联持敌意的态度，但加拿大的海员向世界工联呼吁这一事实，揭露了加拿大职工大会分裂分子的不稳固地位。
