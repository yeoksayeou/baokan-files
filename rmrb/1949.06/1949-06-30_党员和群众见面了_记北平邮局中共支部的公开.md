The CCP Branch of the Beiping Postal Administration went public, and the workers attached great importance to, loved, and admired the Party's affairs infinitely. After the Municipal Party Committee's deployment, the members of the Postal Administration branch, after several days of deliberation, reached a consensus in their thinking and determined the steps for going public. On the 25th, the branch invited twenty non-Party member employees to participate in a branch meeting to review factory security. At 10 a.m. on the 28th, the list of branch members was posted. At 7 p.m., a public Party meeting was held. From 10 a.m. to after 7 p.m., the crowd watching the list never stopped. Some workers even forgot to eat.

Non-Party Members Feel the Party is Respectable and Admirable, Some Workers Want to Join the Party Immediately

The crowd surrounding the list was abuzz with discussion. Some said, "It should have been made public long ago. Why keep it secret now? Once it's public, you'll know who is who and who isn't." The post office still has forty-four party members, and many workers said this was unexpected! "The reactionary forces in the post office were so powerful in the past, yet there were still so many party members!" They felt admirable for the tenacious spirit of the party members. The workers not only felt that the Party was respectable and admirable, but many also expressed envy: "You are all glorious." Five comrades had worked underground but were not yet Party members, and this time they were even more anxious: "What about us? We want to submit a written request to the higher authorities." More than six or seven workers directly approached the branch secretary and committee members, asking, "Can we join the Party today?" "Are we qualified?" "How can we join the Party?" Some workers felt embarrassed to ask themselves, so they asked Party members to apply to the branch secretary on their behalf.

One worker was surprised to see Comrade Cheng Anyu, the military control representative, also listed as an ordinary Party member under the group, and said, "If this were under the Kuomintang, this would definitely not be the way it is."

The Vast Majority of Party Members are Supported, Individual Bad Ones Arouse Great Dissatisfaction Among the Masses

The masses know that the Party is the vanguard of the working class and that Party members should be advanced. They are very concerned about the quality of Party members! Among these forty-four Party members, there is one Zhang Fuxin, because he is not active in his work, uses coercion, is divorced from the masses, and his past conduct was not upright. The workers expressed extreme dissatisfaction that he was also a Party member, feeling that it really hurt the purity of the Party. Some workers said, "He bullied me when I was with him. How can he still be a Party member?" Some said, "If he can be, why am I not qualified?" Some directly said, "Zhang Fuxin is not qualified to be a Communist Party member." One worker questioned the branch committee member unceremoniously: "Who introduced such a Party member?"

The workers also raised opinions about some workers who should be Party members but have not yet joined the Party. The old worker Guan Xicun, who is over fifty years old, has been a revolutionary for many years and has been in prison for five or six years. Because he lost contact, his name was not on the list this time, and the workers reflected: "Although he has a bit of a bad temper, he is so serious in his work and has such a long revolutionary history, how is he still not a Party member?" Li Zhihong ran to the liberated area because he could not exist in Beiping due to the struggle with the enemy in the past. This time he came back to help take over and showed active performance. Some people also reflected: "How come he hasn't joined the Party yet?" The old worker Yong Dexin, everyone only knew that he was active in his work, but they didn't expect him to still be a Party member at his age. As soon as they saw his name on the list, they discussed: "I didn't expect Old Man Yong to be a Party member, he's really good."

Branch Holds a Meeting to Review Work, More Than 100 Non-Party Members Participate

The branch sent out invitations the day before yesterday, inviting administrative leaders and cadres above the level of union group leaders to participate in the branch meeting, and welcomed the masses to participate freely. The meeting was held on the fourth floor, and more than 100 non-Party members came, as well as representatives of postal workers from Nanyuan and the western suburbs who rushed from afar. Comrade Sun Xun, the branch secretary, synthesized the opinions of the various branch groups and reviewed the relationship between the Party and the masses. He said: "The branch committee's ideological leadership over Party members and the masses is too poor, and the backbone role played by Party members among the masses is not enough. The branch work is not planned, and there is no supervision or inspection after deployment, and some plans cannot be implemented. In terms of style, it is not democratic enough, and things have not been well discussed with the masses. We don't pay attention to the experience and creativity of the masses, and we haven't solved the problems that should be solved among the masses in a timely manner. Some masses have requested to join the Party, but we haven't absorbed and educated them in a timely manner... The branch also made a review at the last security work review meeting.

The Masses Sincerely Love the Party, and Offer Criticisms and Suggestions

Because the branch representatives earnestly made reviews, the masses realized that the Party is not an outsider, and they are willing to boldly speak out what they want to say and give the Party many constructive suggestions. Non-Party employee Dong Zhongyuan said at the branch's review of security work meeting: "Because the Communist Party is a democratic party, I am willing to speak boldly. I say that we have fire prevention equipment in our bureau, and this fire is not a equipment problem, it is because the Communist Party members are divorced from the masses, and the masses will not think of ways to help. This work cannot be done by a few guards and a few Party members. If the masses are divided into shifts to be responsible, plus learning to use fire-fighting equipment and holding regular exercises, wouldn't it be done well?" The venue burst into warm applause. The day before yesterday, Li Kaijun of the Savings and Remittance Section gave two opinions to the Party and the masses at the public meeting. He said: "I am honored to attend the meeting as a non-Party member. Everyone should care about the country. The Communist Party is the leader of the country. We should care more about it. From the past few months since liberation, I have realized that the Communist Party is worthy of leading us. I personally have two opinions on the Communist Party: 1. The absorption of Party members must be selective; 2. We must maintain Party discipline and carry forward the spirit of hard work, and not be confused by the urban environment. I hope that non-Party members will protect the Party from the standpoint of a member of the people, and raise any opinions. We can only rely on the Communist Party to run the country well; I hope that everyone will not misunderstand the entire Party because of one bad Party member..."

Worker Lu Yuzhang (non-Party member) said: "You must not be divorced from the masses. The post office cannot be run well by just a few of you Party members. No matter how many millions of Communists there are, there are still more people. You must win people's hearts, unite and organize the workers. Don't underestimate us. Now it is not the masses who are divorced from you, but you are running too fast and we can't keep up. You must let everyone know and discuss with everyone what you have done." Everyone responded with warm applause.

Several other employees spoke. Comrade Zhang Wentong, a member of the branch committee, accepted everyone's opinions on behalf of the branch and expressed his willingness for everyone to supervise at any time.

　　党员和群众见面了
  　记北平邮局中共支部的公开
    中国共产党北平市邮政管理局支部党员，和群众见面了，工人群众对党的事情十分的重视，热爱和无限的钦佩。在市委布置后邮管局支部党员，经过了多日的酝酿，党员思想取得了一致，并确定了公开的步骤。二十五日，支部就邀请了二十位非党员职工，参加了支部检讨保卫工厂会议，二十八日上午十点，就贴出了支部党员名单，下午七点，又举行了公开党的会议，从上午十点到下午七点多，看名单的人群就没有断过，有的工友，运吃饭也忘记了。
    非党员感到党可敬可佩，有些工人想立刻入党
    围着名单的人群中，议论纷纷。有的说：“早就应该公开了，现在还秘密干什么？一公开就知道谁是谁不是了。”邮局还有四十四个党员，许多工人说这是出乎意料的！“过去邮局反动势力那么强大，还有这么多党员存在！”对党员顽强的精神，感到可敬。工友们不仅仅是感到党可敬可佩，不少人表示很羡慕：“你们都光荣。”有五个同志作过地下工作，因为还不是党员，这次更有点着急了：“我们是怎么回事呢？我们要向上级提出请求书。”更有六七个工友直接找到支书，支委，提出“今天能不能入党？”“我们够条件吗？”“怎么才能够入党呢？”有的工友觉得自己提出不好意思，就托党员向支书申请。
    有个工友见到军管代表成安玉同志，也是列在小组下面的一个普通党员，很觉诧异，还说：“要是国民党时，这一定非是头不行。”
    党员绝大多数受到拥护，个别不好的，群众甚为不满
    群众知道党是工人阶级的先锋队，党员都应该是先进的。对党员的好坏十分关心！这四十四个党员中有个张复新，因为他工作不积极，强迫命令，脱离群众，过去作风不正派，工人群众对于他也是个党员，表示极端不满，觉得实在有伤党的纯洁性。有的工友说：“我和他在一起，他还欺负人，他怎么还能当党员？”有的说：“象他那样，我为什么不够格？”有的直接了当地说：“张复新不够共产党员资格。”有个工友不客气质问支委：“这样的党员是谁介绍的？”
    工友们，对于有些应该是党员而尚未入党的工友，也提出了意见，五十多岁的老工友关西村，革命多年，曾经住过五六年监狱，因为失了关系，这次名单上没有他，工友就反映：“他虽有点脾气不好，可是工作那么认真，革命历史这么长，怎么还不是党员呢？”李志宏因过去和敌人斗争，在北平不能存在，就跑到解放区，这次回来帮助接管，表现积极，也有人反映：“象他这样怎么还没有入党呢？”老工友勇德馨，大家只知道他工作积极，可没想到他这么老还是党员。一见名单上有他就议论：“想不到勇老头也是党员，他真行。”
    支部开会检讨工作，非党员百余人参加
    支部前天发出请帖，请行政负责人，工会小组长以上干部来参加支部大会，并欢迎群众自由参加。会议在四楼举行，非党群众来了一百多人，还有远路赶来的南苑，西郊的邮工代表。支部书记孙逊同志综合了支部各小组意见，对党与群众关系作了检讨，他说：“支委会对党员、群众的思想领导太差，党员在群众中起的骨干作用不够。支部工作没有计划，布置了没有督促，没有检查，有些计划贯彻不下去。在作风上不够民主，有事没能很好的向群众作商量。对群众的经验、创造性不重视、对群众中应该解决的问题没及时解决，有些群众要求入党也没及时的吸收和教育……上次保卫工作检讨会上，支部也同样作了检讨。
    群众真诚爱护党，纷纷提出批评和意见
    因为支部代表党员都认真地作了检讨，群众体会到党不是外人，自已要说的话，都愿大胆说出来，并给党提了许多建设性的意见。非党员工友董中元在支部检讨保卫工作会上说：“因为共产党是民主的党，我愿大胆说话，我说，我们局子里防空、防火设备都有，这次失火不是设备问题，就是共产党员脱离群众，群众就不会给想办法。这工作，并不是一个纠察队、几个党员能办起来的。把群众分班负责，再加上学习使用防火设备，定期演习，不就会作好吗？”会场响起热烈的鼓掌声。前天支部公开会上储汇股李开浚对党对群众各提了两点意见，他说：“我以非党员的资格出席会议，感到很荣幸，每个人应该关心国家，共产党是国家领导者，我们对它，应该更关心，从解放后几个月来，我体会到共产党配得领导我们，我个人对共产党有两点意见：１、吸收党员，一定要精；２、要维持党的纪律，发扬艰苦作风，不要被城市环境所迷惑。我希望不是党员的：要站在人民一分子的立场上来爱护党，有意见就提，我们只有依靠共产党才能把国家搞好；希望大家不要以一个党员差就误会整个党……”
    工人吕玉张（非党员）说：“你们千万不要脱离群众，邮局只靠你们几个党员是搞不好的，共产党人再多有几百万，也没有人民多的，你们要收住人心，把工人团结起来，组织起来，不要小看我们，现在不是群众脱离你们，而是你们跑得太快，我们跟不上。做了什么事，要叫大家知道，和大家商量。”大家又以热烈的鼓掌给以回答。
    又有几位职工讲了话，支委张文通同志，代表支部接受了大家的意见，并表示愿大家随时监督。
