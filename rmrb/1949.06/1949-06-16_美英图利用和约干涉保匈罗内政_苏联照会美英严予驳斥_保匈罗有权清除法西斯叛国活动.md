Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 15th: According to TASS, Moscow: After the treasonous activities of US and British agents in Hungary, Romania, and Bulgaria, such as Bishop Mindszenty, were suppressed by the Hungarian, Romanian, and Bulgarian governments, the US and British governments sent notes to the Hungarian, Romanian, and Bulgarian governments in early April, insisting that they had violated the peace treaty, especially the clauses concerning the guarantee of human rights and fundamental freedoms. The Hungarian, Romanian, and Bulgarian governments immediately gave a stern reply, pointing out that the US and British notes were groundless and constituted an attempt to interfere in the internal affairs of Hungary, Romania, and Bulgaria. On May 31st, the US and British governments again sent notes to the Hungarian, Romanian, and Bulgarian governments, saying that disputes had arisen between the US and British governments and the Hungarian, Romanian, and Bulgarian governments regarding the interpretation of the peace treaty. At the same time, the US and British notes to the Soviet Union requested a meeting of the heads of the diplomatic missions of the US, British, and Soviet Union in Hungary, Romania, and Bulgaria to review this dispute. On June 11th, Soviet Ambassador to the United States, Pan Youxin, was instructed to submit a note to the US government, stating that the Soviet government had studied the aforementioned notes from the United States and Hungary, Romania, and Bulgaria. "The Soviet Union believes that the aforementioned notes from Bulgaria, Hungary, and Romania have provided a detailed response to the US government's accusations against these countries for violating the peace treaty. Judging from these notes, the governments of Bulgaria, Hungary, and Romania have clearly and accurately fulfilled their obligations under the peace treaty, including the obligation to guarantee basic human rights and freedoms. The measures taken by the governments of Bulgaria, Hungary, and Romania (which the US government expressed dissatisfaction with in its note of April 2nd this year) not only do not violate the peace treaty, but are also intended to fulfill the peace treaty, as the peace treaty requires the aforementioned countries to combat fascist organizations and other organizations that "pursue the goal of depriving the people of their democratic rights." The measures taken by Bulgaria, Hungary, and Romania to fulfill the various clauses of the peace treaty fall entirely within the scope of these countries' internal affairs as sovereign states, which is self-evident. The Soviet government believes that the US government's artificial attempt to turn this issue into a subject of dispute is a direct attempt to use the peace treaty to interfere in the internal affairs of Bulgaria, Hungary, and Romania, in order to exert pressure on their domestic policies. In view of this, the Soviet Embassy is instructed to declare: "The Soviet government sees no reason to convene a meeting of the heads of the three countries' diplomatic missions." On June 12th, Soviet Chargé d'Affaires in the United Kingdom, Yerofeyev, submitted a similar note to the British government on behalf of the Soviet government.

　　美英图利用和约干涉保匈罗内政
  　苏联照会美英严予驳斥
    保匈罗有权清除法西斯叛国活动
    【新华社北平十五日电】据塔斯社莫斯科讯：美英在匈、罗、保的代理人明曾蒂主教等的叛国活动为匈、罗、保政府取缔之后，美英政府于四月初曾照会匈、罗、保政府，硬说它们触犯和约，特别是和约中有关保证人权及基本自由的条款。匈罗保政府当时即予以严正答复，指出美英照会毫无根据，而且是一种干涉匈罗保三国内政的企图。五月三十一日，美英政府又照会匈、罗、保政府，说美英政府与匈、罗、保政府之间在和约的解释上发生纠纷。同时美英照会苏联，要求召开英美苏三国驻匈罗保外交使馆首长会议，来审议这一纠纷。六月十一日，苏联驻美大使潘友新奉命向美国政府提出照会称：苏联政府已研究了美国和匈罗保三国的上述各照会，“苏联认为：上述保匈罗三国照会已给美国政府对这些国家违犯和约的责难提出了详尽的答复。从这些照会看来，保匈罗三国政府显然已确切履行其按照和约所担负的义务，包括保证基本人权及自由的义务。保匈罗三国政府所采取的措施（美国政府曾于本年四月二日的照会中对此表示不满），不但不违犯和约，而且是为了履行和约，因为和约责成上述各国对法西斯式的组织和其他“奉行旨在剥夺人民底民主权利”的组织进行斗争。保匈罗三国为了履行和约各项条款而采取的措施，完全属于这些国家作为自主国的内政权限以内，这是不言而喻的。苏联政府认为美国政府人为地力图把这个问题变成纠纷的主题，是直接企图利用和约来干涉保匈罗三国内政，以便对它们的国内政策施以压力。有鉴于此，苏联大使馆奉命声明：“苏联政府认为没有理由召开三国外交使馆首长的会议”。六月十二日，苏联驻英国代办叶罗菲耶夫奉苏联政府之命向英国政府提出同样的照会。
