Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, 1st: TASS reports: Soviet Foreign Minister Vyshinsky delivered a speech at the Foreign Ministers Conference on May 30th, refuting the proposals of the United States, Britain, and France as follows:

　　On May 28th, the delegations of the United States, Britain, and France presented their proposals regarding the issue of German unification.

　　It can be seen from the proposals of the United States, Britain, and France that these proposals avoid the issue of drafting a pan-German constitution using democratic methods, and only state that the Soviet zone should be subordinate to the Bonn Constitution. As is well known, this constitution was drafted in complete secrecy by a specially selected small group, in violation of democratic principles. The German people were deprived of the opportunity to participate in the discussion of this constitution. At the same time, this so-called constitution was also drafted under the open pressure of the occupying authorities of the Western countries, and its main clauses were basically dictated by the occupying authorities. In this way, the federal system was imposed on the German people, and the German democratic forces are protesting against this system, for reasons that are completely understandable, namely because the plan to federalize Germany is not a plan to unify Germany, but a plan to dismember Germany. It is also important to point out that the so-called Bonn Constitution does not contain any provisions restricting the control of German monopoly capital and the Junker aristocracy, who were the instigators and organizers of German aggression and the main pillars of the Hitler regime. This alone proves that this constitution cannot be considered a democratic constitution. The proposal of the United States, Britain, and France to extend the so-called Bonn Constitution to all of Germany is nothing more than an attempt to impose on East Germany a system that was established without the participation of the East German people and without the participation of the Soviet Union, which, according to the Potsdam Agreement, is responsible for the Soviet occupation zone in East Germany. This proposal by the United States, Britain, and France also disregards the fact that the German people in the Soviet occupation zone have already expressed their attitude towards the future German institutions in the draft constitution drafted by the People's Committee and discussed by the entire people.

　　Section 3 of the Western Three Powers' draft suggests implementing the so-called occupation statutes drafted in Washington throughout Germany. This suggestion in fact means abandoning the conclusion of a peace treaty with Germany and extending the occupation system indefinitely. Everyone knows that the first paragraph of the occupation statutes only states that "the occupation needs to be extended for a considerable period of time." The three countries are trying to portray the issue as if the occupation statutes are aimed at "enabling the German people to establish a democratic autonomous government," as stated in the communique of the Washington talks between the foreign ministers of the United States, Britain, and France. However, this is completely contradictory to the content of the occupation statutes. Everyone knows that according to the occupation statutes (Articles 2 and 3), extremely important functions of the state administrative organs are monopolized by the occupying authorities, and the German people are not allowed to participate in the execution of all these extremely important functions. Implementing such occupation statutes is not in the interests of the German people. As is well known, the German people are striving for the earliest possible conclusion of a peace treaty and the end of the occupation system. The occupation statutes are also in contradiction with the task of creating peace in Europe.

　　As for the three countries' proposals on the issue of reparations and German enterprises acquired by "a certain foreign country or its representatives"—as proposed in the above-mentioned proposal—they do not touch upon the issue of German unification discussed by the Foreign Ministers Conference. However, one cannot help but point out that while the three countries insist on returning the above-mentioned enterprises, they remain silent on the fact that American and British monopoly capital is infiltrating the West German economy on a large scale with the help of the occupying authorities, especially the Ruhr industry.

　　The proposals of the three countries attempt to use the "principles" listed in Section 2 of their proposals as conditions for German unification. The Soviet delegation believes that it is necessary to point out that this attempt is unfounded, because in the Soviet occupation zone, the exercise of the democratic freedom rights of all the people, except for fascists, has been guaranteed. As for the real situation in the West German occupation zone, the so-called "freedom" there actually means persecution of democratic parties and groups, while the large monopoly capital and groups that supported Hitler's aggression in the past have the freedom to act.

　　The proposals of the United States, Britain, and France transform the four-nation control mechanism (the so-called High Commission) from the principle of unanimous decision-making established by existing agreements to majority vote decision-making. The viewpoint of this proposal is not a policy of cooperation between the occupying countries in Germany, but a policy of coercive command. It will not be successful to implement such a policy against the Soviet Union.

　　So, what is our overall conclusion regarding the proposals on the issue of German unification put forward by the delegations of the United States, Britain, and France at the Foreign Ministers Conference on May 28th? Our overall conclusion is: this proposal cannot prove that these countries are willing to reach an agreement with the Soviet Union on the extremely important issue of German unification. At the same time, these proposals are in conflict with the legitimate interests of the German people and their struggle for the earliest possible conclusion of a peace treaty and the end of the occupation system. The Soviet delegation believes that it is necessary to reject the three-nation proposal that contradicts the resolutions of the Yalta and Potsdam Conferences.

　　In order to guarantee the economic and political unification of Germany, the Soviet delegation submitted its proposals for consideration at the Foreign Ministers Conference at the very beginning of this session. The Soviet delegation is deeply convinced that the completion of the task of the Foreign Ministers Conference can be guaranteed through the Soviet proposals.

　　The Soviet delegation suggests restoring the activities of the Four-Nation Control Committee in Germany on the previous basis, in accordance with the resolution of the Potsdam Conference of the Soviet Union, the United States, and Britain, and later with the participation of France. When taking this measure, the great importance of this institution should be taken into account, as it is responsible for exercising supreme power in Germany during the occupation period.

　　At the same time, the Soviet delegation believes that the economic and political unification of Germany cannot be realized without the establishment of a single German central institution dealing with national and economic development issues of pan-German significance. The Soviet delegation suggests establishing a pan-German State Council based on the existing German economic institutions in the eastern and western occupation zones, as the German economic and administrative center, exercising government functions in the above-mentioned economic and national development, while retaining the supreme power of the Control Committee.

　　The Soviet delegation also suggests restoring the Berlin Four-Nation Command and the entire Berlin City Council in Berlin. The issue of the election date of the City Council will be studied by the Allied Joint Command in Berlin.

　　All these measures are conducive to the solution of the issue of restoring German unification economically and politically. The Soviet delegation's position is completely in line with the principles of the Potsdam Agreement, completely in line with the task of restoring German unification, completely in line with the interests of the German people in striving for the early conclusion of a peace treaty and the end of the occupation system, and completely in line with the task of creating peace in Europe.

　　巴黎外长会议六次会上
  　维辛斯基演词全文
    【新华社北平一日电】塔斯社柏林讯：苏外长维辛斯基五月三十日在外长会议上发表驳斥美英法建议的演说如下：
    五月廿八日，美、英、法三国代表团提出其关于德国统一问题的建议。
    从美、英、法的建议中可以看到，这些建议对以民主方法草拟全德宪法的问题避而不谈，而只是说苏占区应隶属于波恩宪法。如所周知，这一宪法是在触犯民主的原则下由特意选定的一小群人在十分秘密的情况下拟定的。德国人民被剥夺了参与讨论这一宪法的机会。同时，这个所谓宪法，也是在西方国家占领当局的公开压力下拟定的，该宪法的主要条款，基本上是由占领当局所授意的。用这种方法，联邦制度遂被强加在德国人民的头上，德国民主力量正对这一制度提出抗议，其理由是完全可以理解的，这就是因为使德国联邦化的计划，不是统一德国的计划，而是肢解德国的计划。指出下述一点也是重要的，即所谓波恩宪法并不包含任何限制德国垄断资本及容克贵族之控制地位的规定，它们曾是德国侵略的鼓动者和组织者，而且是希特勒政权的主要支柱。只用这一点就证明了，这一宪法决不能被认为是民主的宪法。美、英、法之把所谓波恩宪法扩大施行于全德的建议，不是别的，只是企图把没有东德人民参加和没有苏联参加而建立的制度强施于东德，而按照波茨坦协定，苏联则负责东德占领区。美、英、法的这一建议，也将下述事实置于不顾，即苏占区的德国人民，在由人民委员会草拟而经过全体人民讨论的宪法草案中，已表示了他们对未来德国机构的态度。
    西方三国草案第三节建议，把在华盛顿拟定的所谓占领法规在全德国实施，这一建议事实上意味着放弃缔结对德和约，无限期延长占领制度。大家都知道，占领法规第一段只是说到，“占领需要作相当时期之延长”。三国企图把问题说成好象占领法规旨在“能使德国人民建立民主自治政府”，如象美、英、法外长在华盛顿谈判公报中所说的。但是，这与占领法规的内容是完全矛盾的。大家都知道，依照占领法规（二、三两条）国家行政机构的极为重要的职权，都为占领当局所垄断，而德国人民却不得参加所有这些极为重要的职权的执行。施行这种占领法规，是不符合于德国人民的利益的，如所周知，德国人民正在为尽早缔结和约及结束占领制度而奋斗。占领法规也与在欧洲缔造和平的任务相矛盾。
    至于三国关于赔偿问题及“某外国或其代表”所取得——如象上述建议中所提出的——的德国企业问题的建议，却没有触及外长会议所讨论的德国统一问题，但是，人们也不能不提出，三国一方面坚持交回上述企业，而同时，却对美、英垄断资本借占领当局之助大量渗入西德经济，首先是鲁尔工业的事实保持缄默。
    三国的建议企图以其建议中第二节所列举的“原则”为德国统一的条件，苏联代表团认为有必要指出，这种企图是没有根据的，因为在苏联占领区，除法西斯分子之外，全体人民民主自由权利的行使已经得到保证。至于德国西占区的现实情形，所谓“自由”，在该地实际上就意味着对民主政党和团体的迫害，而过去支持希特勒侵略的大垄断资本和集团，却有着行动的自由。
    美、英、法的建议，把四国管制机构（所谓高级委员会）从现有协议所确立的全体一致决定问题的原则，转变到多数票决定。这一建议的观点，不是德境各占领国之间合作的政策，而是强迫命令的政策。对苏联施行这种政策是不会成功的。
    那么，对于美、英、法代表团五月二十八日在外长会议上提出的关于德国统一问题的建议，我们总的结论是什么呢？我们总的结论是：这一建议不能证明这些国家愿意就极为重要的德国统一问题与苏联达到协议，同时，这些建议却与德国人民的合法利益及他们为尽早缔结和约及结束占领制度的奋斗相抵触。苏联代表团认为有必要拒绝与雅尔塔及波茨坦会议之决议相抵触的三国建议。
    为了保证德国经济与政治的统一，苏联代表团在本届外长会议刚一开始时就将其建议提交外长会议考虑：苏联代表团深信，通过苏联的建议就能够保证外长会议任务的完成。
    苏联代表团建议按照苏、美、英而后来有法国参加的波茨坦会议的决议，在先前的基础上恢复德境四国管委会的活动。在采取这种措施的时候，要考虑到这一机构的巨大重要性，在占领期间，它要负责在德国执行最高权力。
    同时，苏联代表团认为，不建立处理具有全德意义的国家与经济发展问题的、单一的德国中央机构，则德国的经济与政治的统一就不可能实行，苏联代表团建议，以东西占领区现存的德国经济机构为基础成立全德国务会议，作为德国经济与行政中心，在上述经济与国家发展方面行使政府职权，同时并保留管制委员会的最高权力。
    苏联代表团并建议在柏林恢复柏林四国司令部和全柏林市议会，市议会选举日期问题，则交由柏林各盟国联合司令部研究。
    所有这些措施，对于在经济上与政治上恢复德国统一问题的解决都是有利的。苏联代表团的这种立场，完全符合波茨坦协议的原则，完全符合恢复德国统一的任务，完全符合争取早日缔结和约和结束占领制度的德国人民的利益，也完全符合在欧洲缔造和平的任务。
