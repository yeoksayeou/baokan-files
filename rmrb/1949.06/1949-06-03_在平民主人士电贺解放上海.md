Xinhua News Agency, Beiping, 2nd: Democratic figures in Beiping have sent telegrams congratulating the Third Field Army of the Chinese People's Liberation Army on the great victory of liberating Shanghai. The telegram reads as follows:

To Generals Chen Yi, Rao Shushi, Su Yu, and Tan Zhenlin of the Third Field Army of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, and please convey our respects to all commanders and fighters of your army: Shanghai, amidst the longing and anxiety of the people of China and the world, has seen the light and achieved liberation. This is originally a part of the great cause of the liberation of the entire Chinese people, and one of the countless undertakings of the people of China and the world to rebuild the world. However, this command post, which has served as the base for imperialism to invade China and enslave the Chinese people for nearly a century, has been seized by the power of the Chinese people today, which illustrates a particularly significant meaning. This not only reports the overall victory of the Chinese people's liberation cause, but also indicates a significant change in the balance of power between the people of the world and anti-people forces. Especially at a time when imperialists refuse to accept the lessons of World War II and attempt to incite and organize new wars, the liberation of Shanghai is a severe blow to the dying imperialism and colonial exploitation system. This has even more world-shaking value in the entire history of the world. China's own fate of being reduced from a feudal ancient country to a semi-colony has hereby come to an end. All the people in the world who have suffered from the damage and humiliation of the colonial system have since strengthened and confirmed their confidence and path in striving for liberation. The entire Chinese nation symbolizes the bright power of fighting against and defeating colonizers, exploiters, and oppressors.

Carrying the great banner of Mao Zedong, you have taken root and grown strong from the vast land of China, following the bloody footprints of countless martyrs who have strived for the independence and liberation of the Chinese nation for a century, and are firmly and clearly stepping onto the road to overall victory. Facing the remnant forces of national scum who fantasize about relying on Shanghai, the imperialist base, to resist stubbornly, you have advanced so heroically and prudently, for fear of harming the lives and property of the people. You have embodied the will of the Chinese people and the thought of Mao Zedong, making the revolutionary forces in the vast land of the country and the revolutionary forces of the people of Shanghai perfectly cooperate, creating the glorious liberation of Shanghai. When we heard the news that you were camping on the Bund after entering the urban area of Shanghai, resting from the fatigue of the long battle, we not only felt your heroic and pure great mind, but also seemed to see the excited and joyful faces of the entire people of Shanghai. The people of Shanghai welcome such their own troops, how should they further strengthen their confidence. The power of the people is meeting so solemnly and harmoniously, and the light of the people is so brilliantly and boundlessly engulfing the darkness of the reactionaries. For those of us who know what "Shanghai life" is like, we can better appreciate the profound impact you have given to this sinful city that has been under reactionary rule for a long time. Our gratitude and respect for you is not difficult to imagine: how can this be completely expressed by simply shouting "Long live the Chinese People's Liberation Army," "Long live the Chinese Communist Party," and "Long live Mao Zedong"? We hereby send our congratulations and wish you good health.

　　在平民主人士电贺解放上海
    【新华社北平二日电】在平民主人士顷电贺中国人民解放军第三野战军解放上海大捷，电文如下：
    中国人民解放军第三野战军陈毅、饶漱石、粟裕、谭震林诸将军并请转贵军全体指战员，上海在全中国和世界人民的渴望与焦念中沐见光明，获得了解放。这本来是整个中国人民解放的伟业中的一部，是全中国和全世界人民重建世界的无数事业中的一种。可是这一座作为近百年来帝国主义侵略中国奴化中国人民的司令台，今天由中国人民的力量夺取过来，这就说明了特殊重大的意义。这不只是报道着中国人民解放事业的全盘胜利，同时也指示出全世界人民与反人民力量对比上的显著变化。尤其是在帝国主义者不肯接受第二次世界大战的教训，企图煽动与组织新的战争的时候，上海的解放是迎面向垂死的帝国主义与殖民地剥削制度给予严重的打击。这在全部世界历史上更有旋转乾坤的价值。中国自己由封建古国沦为半殖民的命运从此宣告结束。全世界上凡是遭受殖民地制度损害与欺辱的人民更从此坚定与确认了争取解放的信心与道路。中华民族整个地象征了对殖民者、剥削者与压迫者搏斗而且胜利了的光明力量。
    你们肩负着伟大的毛泽东旗帜，从中国的广大的土地里生根壮大，步武百年来争取中华民族独立解放的无数先烈的血迹，坚定而明确地踏向全盘胜利的大路。面对着民族败类的残余力量幻想凭借帝国主义基地的上海负隅顽抗，你们是那么英勇而又审慎地进军，惟恐伤害了人民的生命与财产。你们体现了中国人民的意志，体现了毛泽东思想，使得全国广大土地上的革命力量和上海人民的革命力量完美配合，造成上海的光荣解放。当我们听到你们进入上海市区后露宿在黄浦滩头，休息久战的疲劳的消息，我们不只感念到你们英勇而纯善的伟大心胸，同时也仿佛看见了整个上海人民激动欢欣的面色。上海人民迎接着这样的自己的队伍，更该怎样坚定自己的信心。人民的力量是这么严整谐合地会师，人民的光明是这么灿烂无边的淹没了反动者的黑暗。对于我们知道什么叫作“上海生活”的人们，我们更能体会到你们给予这一座长期反动统治的罪恶的都市的深厚影响。我们对你们的感谢与敬意是不难想象的：这岂只是三呼“中国人民解放军万岁”，“中国共产党万岁”，“毛泽东万岁”所能完全表达的么？谨电祝贺，并颂健康。
