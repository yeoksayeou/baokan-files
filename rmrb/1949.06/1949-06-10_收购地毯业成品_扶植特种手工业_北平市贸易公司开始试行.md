　　Purchasing Finished Carpet Products to Support Specialized Handicraft Industry: Beijing Trading Company Begins Pilot Program

    [Report from this newspaper] The Beijing Trading Company has begun a pilot program to support the city's specialized handicraft industry, specifically the carpet industry, by purchasing stockpiled products. The carpet industry in Beijing is a major specialized handicraft industry, and its products account for a large proportion of Beijing's exports. There are more than 100 businesses engaged in this industry in the city (excluding eight larger factories, the rest are small factories or workshops). Due to the temporary suspension of foreign trade, carpet production has almost come to a standstill. According to investigations, the entire carpet industry in Beijing has approximately 10,000 square feet (referring to exportable carpets) of products stockpiled due to the inability to export. In order to solve the current sales problem of the industry, the Beijing Trading Company contacted the Tianjin Foreign Trade Company and began purchasing a batch of carpets in the city at the beginning of this month to try to support the industry. A total of 39 carpets, totaling 4,536 square feet, were purchased in two rounds. A total of 24 factories and workshops, including Chang Ji, were able to sell their stockpiled products. In order to truly achieve the goal of supporting the industry and restoring production, the Trading Company is not only preparing some raw materials (wool yarn, cotton yarn, etc.) to meet the needs of the industry, but also stipulates that the current target for purchasing products are factories or workshops that are currently suspended but have not yet laid off workers, and can resume work with support. As for those that are no longer able to reproduce or the inventory of transportation and sales merchants, they will not be purchased. (Yu)

　　收购地毯业成品　扶植特种手工业
  　北平市贸易公司开始试行
    【本报讯】北平贸易公司开始试行以收购积压产品方式，扶植本市特种手工业之一的地毯业。北平的地毯业是特种手工业中主要的一种，其产品占北平出口货物的大宗。全市经营这个行业的共有一百余家（除八家较大工厂外，其余皆为小型工厂或作坊），由于对外贸易暂时的停顿，地毯业生产也几乎陷于停顿状态，据调查本市全部地毯业因为不能出口而积压在手里的产品约有一万方尺（指能出口者）以上。本市贸易公司为了解决该业目前所存在的销售问题，遂与天津对外贸易公司取得联系，于本月初开始在本市收购一批地毯试行对该业进行扶植，前后两次共收购了地毯三十九块，合四千五百三十六方尺。获得售出积存产品的工厂和作坊计有常记等二十四家。贸易公司为了切实达到扶植该业恢复生产的目的，除着手准备部分原料（毛线、棉纱等）以供该业之需要外，并规定目前收购产品的对象为目前虽然停工，但工人尚未解散，加以扶植即能复工的工厂或作坊。至于已无再生产可能者或运销贩卖商之存货，则一律不加收购。　　　（宇）
