　　Talking about New Democracy Education on Teachers' Day
       Xu Teli
    Today is Teachers' Day. Teachers occupy a major position among educators. Today, I am writing this article to celebrate Teachers' Day and as a gift to teachers. Because our teachers are educators of the New Democratic era, if we call them educators, then they should be educators who are not divorced from reality. Therefore, what I write about education today is aimed at the actual situation of today's New Democratic society.

    Today, as we commemorate this Teachers' Day, we are at a critical juncture of China's new, comprehensive, and world-significant transformation. This era, unlike any previous era in Chinese history, is precisely at the end of the revolutionary process of an independent, unified, democratic, prosperous, and strong new China, which is about to achieve a comprehensive victory. The conditions of possibility for new economic construction, new cultural construction, and new national defense construction are fully available, and these tasks are now about to begin in a planned and systematic manner. These new construction tasks are placed on the shoulders of scientific and technical personnel (economic construction and national defense construction workers) on the one hand, and on the shoulders of cultural and educational workers, especially teachers, on the other (because teachers are directly engaged in education and have a large number). Therefore, today's Teachers' Day has its special historical significance.

    Our educational tasks and educational objectives were put forward as early as 1945 in Chairman Mao's "On Coalition Government."
  　A　Educational Tasks

    (1) On cadre education: China is a culturally backward country caused by national oppression and feudal oppression. The Chinese people's liberation struggle urgently needs intellectuals, and therefore intellectuals are particularly important. Therefore, the government should plan to cultivate various types of intellectual cadres from the broad masses of people and pay attention to uniting and educating all existing useful intellectuals.

    (2) On mass education: Eliminating illiteracy from 80 percent of the population is a necessary condition for New Democracy. ("Modern science and modern technology depend on electrification. Illiterate people are not suitable for solving electrification, and mere literacy is not enough. It is necessary to know how to technically apply electricity to industry and agriculture, to all sectors of industry and agriculture. You must learn this yourself and teach all young working masses to learn this." Lenin: The Tasks of the Youth Leagues).

    (3) On the transformation of old intellectuals: The attitude towards old cultural workers and old educational workers is to adopt appropriate methods to educate them so that they can acquire new viewpoints and new methods (this is the viewpoint and method of historical materialism, which will be discussed below) to serve the Chinese people.
  　B　Educational Objectives

    (1) The purpose of Chinese national culture and national education should be New Democracy. That is to say, China should establish its own national, scientific, and people-oriented new culture and new education.

    (2) The policy towards foreign culture and ancient Chinese culture:

    1. For foreign culture, we should try to absorb progressive culture as a mirror for China's cultural movement (plan to translate Soviet and capitalist countries' educational systems, teaching methods, textbooks, etc. for reference). We should critically absorb it based on the actual needs of the Chinese people.

    2. For ancient Chinese culture, similarly, we should neither reject it completely nor blindly obey it, but critically accept it to promote China's New Democratic culture.

    (3) The policy of uniting intellectuals: Under the general policy of struggling for the cause of the Chinese people's liberation, Communists should unite well with all intellectuals regardless of class, belief, or party affiliation.

    The above-mentioned educational tasks and educational objectives are conclusions drawn based on the analysis of materials on the historical development of the Chinese revolution, rather than excerpts from education books or empty ideas from the brain. The following will discuss educational methods, which should also be based on historical conditions to avoid being divorced from reality and failing to complete the above-mentioned tasks and achieve the above-mentioned objectives.

    Before discussing educational methods, the educational tasks have already been put forward above, so our method is not a general method, but a method to complete certain educational tasks. Since our task is a new task, this method must also be a new method. In terms of completing tasks, we are learning for application, not shooting without a target; in terms of methods, we are learning from application, not separating it from practice to concentrate on books (combining theory and practice). We do not despise reading books, and we must absorb all the cultural heritage of mankind, ancient and modern, Chinese and foreign, through books (the "ancient and modern, Chinese and foreign method" of learning can be found in the Selected Works of Mao Zedong).

    In order to complete the task of building a new democratic and new China, and educating the future generations of construction, we cannot use the old methods of old democracy and feudal remnants. According to Lenin:

    "One of the greatest misfortunes left to us by the old capitalist society is the complete separation of books from practical life...Knowledge of communism from communist pamphlets and works obtained without work and without struggle is not worth a penny, because this knowledge continues the old separation of theory and practice, which is one of the most repulsive characteristics of the old bourgeois society...In the old schools, the method of forcing young people to memorize nine-tenths of useless and one-tenth of distorted knowledge is adopted...This knowledge encumbers people's minds.

    What we need is knowledge of basic undertakings, knowledge essential to modern times, without encumbering ourselves with useless materials.

    "If we draw the conclusion that we should not absorb what mankind has accumulated in knowledge, that would be a great mistake. It would be wrong to think that the slogan of studying communism, the conclusions of communist science, are enough without absorbing the sum total of human knowledge. Marxism is an example of how communism arose from the sum total of human knowledge. Marx understood that the development of capitalism must inevitably lead to communism, based on the most profound study of capitalism and the complete absorption of everything created by previous science, which was critically transformed without leaving any item unnoticed...and drawing conclusions that people could not draw based on the workers' movement." (All the above quotations are from Lenin's remarks - The Tasks of the Youth Leagues)

    In short, its basic content is: to absorb all human cultural heritage as learning materials, to criticize it with new methods, to remove nine-tenths of the useless, to correct one-tenth of the distorted, and what remains is the knowledge of basic undertakings and all factual knowledge that modern humans cannot do without. This is a method of proceeding from extensive to concise with a purpose and a position.

    Young people are knowledgeable and capable of labor. What I talked about earlier is the method for young people to absorb knowledge, and below I will talk about the method for young people to labor. Regarding the method of youth labor, Lenin said:

    "All young men and women should participate in Saturday labor, using every suburban vegetable garden to help the people; in the countryside and their own alleys, help with cleaning matters and distributing food. This labor should become organized labor, driving out the old compulsory system from the old schools and replacing it with conscious discipline...In the old society, everyone works only for themselves, and no one pays attention to whether there are elderly and sick people here, and whether all family work is pressing on the shoulders of women. The Communist Youth League should say that these should be changed...The generation of people around the age of fifty now has no hope of seeing a communist society; but the generation of people who are now fifteen years old can see it, and they themselves will build this society in the future, and their entire task in life is to build this society. From the age of twelve, the masses should be trained in conscious and disciplined labor. The task of your study should be arranged in such a way that in every village and every city, a certain task of common labor should be solved in practice every day, no matter how small or how simple the task is (simple and small labor work does not hinder learning, and it is a regular mass work that can accumulate small things into big things - author's note)."

    In short, our method is nothing more than the combination of theory and practice.

    The methods discussed above are only general principles. As for the education of cadres, the education of the masses, and the transformation of old intellectuals, it is impossible to propose them specifically here and they cannot be solved without listing special topics.

### 在教师节谈新民主主义教育

　　在教师节谈新民主主义教育
       徐特立
    今天是教师节。教师是在教育工作者中占主要地位者。今天我写这篇文章，是为着来庆祝教师节的，并聊作赠给教师的礼物。因为我们的教师是新民主主义时代的教育工作者，如果说他是教育家的话，那么他应是没有脱离实际的教育家。因此，我今天所写的关于教育的文章，就是针对着今天新民主主义社会的实际情况来说的。
    今天纪念这个教师节，正当着中国历史崭新的全面性的有世界意义的转变关头。这一时代，和过去中国历史任何时代不同，正是处在独立的统一的民主的富强的新中国之革命即将全面胜利的结束，新的经济建设和新的文化建设以及新的国防建设，其可能性的条件已经全部具备，现在正在要有计划地有系统地开始这些工作。这些新的建设任务，一方面摆在科学技术人员（经济建设和国防建设工作者）的面前；一方面摆在文化教育工作者的面前，特别是教师的面前（因为教师是直接进行教育的，又有广大数量的）。所以今天的教师节，有其特殊的历史意义。
    我们的教育任务和教育宗旨，早在一九四五年毛主席的“论联合政府”已经提出来了。
  　甲　教育任务
    （一）关于干部教育：中国是一个被民族压迫与封建压迫所造成的文化落后的国家。中国人民解放斗争，迫切需要知识分子，因而知识分子特别显得重要。因此，今后政府应有计划地从广大人民中培养多类知识分子干部，并注意团结与教育现有一切有用的知识分子。
    （二）关于群众教育：从百分之八十的人口中，扫除文盲，是新民主主义必要的条件。（“现代的科学，现代的技术，依赖于电气化。不识字的人是不适宜于解决电气化的，而且仅仅识字也还是不够的。必须要知道在技术上怎样把电气应用于工业和农业，应用于工业和农业的各个部门。要自己来学习这一点，并且要教全体的青年劳动大众来学习这一点。”列宁：论共产主义青年团的任务）。
    （三）关于旧知识分子之改造：对于旧文化工作者、旧教育工作者的态度，是采取适当办法，教育他们，使他们获得新观点、新方法（这是唯物史观的观点和方法，在下面就要说的），为中国人民服务。
  　乙　教育宗旨
    （一）中国国民文化与国民教育的宗旨，应当是新民主主义的。就是说，中国应当建立自己的民族的、科学的、人民大众的新文化与新教育。
    （二）对于外国文化与中国古代文化的方针：
    １．对于外国文化，应当尽量吸收进步的文化，以为中国文化运动的借镜（有计划地翻译苏联及资本主义国家关于教育制度、教学方法及课本等等，以作参考）。应当以中国人民的实际需要为基础，批判地吸收。
    ２．对于中国古代文化，同样，既不是一概排斥，也不是盲目服从，而是批判地接受它，以利推进中国的新民主主义文化。
    （三）团结知识分子的方针：在为着中国人民解放事业而斗争的总方针下，共产党人应当不分阶级、信仰与党派，和一切知识分子很好地团结起来。
    以上所述的教育任务和教育宗旨，是根据中国革命历史发展的材料，加以分析，得出的结论，而不是从教育书上摘抄下来，凭脑子空想出来的。下面就要谈及教育方法，也是要根据历史条件来说，以免脱离实际，不能完成上面所提出的任务及达到上面所规定的宗旨。
    在没有谈教育方法以前，已经在上面提出了教育的任务，那么我们这一个方法就不是一般的方法，而是要完成一定教育任务的方法。我们的任务既是新的任务，那么这个方法也必须是新的方法。在完成任务上来说，我们是学以致用，不是无的放矢；在方法上来说，我们是从用中去学，不使它脱离实践专念书本（理论与实践结合）。我们并不是轻视书本的阅读，并且要经过书本吸收古今中外（学习的“古今中外法”见毛选）人类的一切文化遗产。
    我们为着完成建设新民主主义新中国的任务而教育建设的后代，就不能用旧民主主义及封建残余的旧方法，据列宁所说：
    “旧的资本主义社会遗留给我们的最大祸害之一，就是书本与生活实践的完全分离。……没有工作，没有斗争，而只是从共产主义小册子和著作里面所得的关于共产主义书本上的知识，是一文钱也不值的，因为这一知识，仍继续了旧的理论与实践的分离，这种旧的分离乃是旧的资产阶级社会底一个最令人厌恶的特色。……旧学校里，采取那青年人死记十分之九无用而十分之一歪曲的一大堆知识的办法。……这种知识困累了人的头脑。
    我们所需要的是基本事业的知识，现代不可少的知识，不拿无用的材料困累自己。
    “如果由此得出一个结论说：不摄取人类知识所积蓄下来的东西，那就犯了很大的错误。如果这样想，以为学习共产主义的口号，共产主义科学的结论就够了，而不需摄取人类知识的总和，那就错了。马克思主义就是共产主义如何从人类知识的总和中产生出来的榜样。马克思懂得资本主义发展必然走向共产主义，是根据对资本主义最深刻的研究并完全摄取了从前的科学所造成的一切东西，都批判的加以改造，未加注意的没有留下一项……并根据工人运动，加以检查，而得出了人们所不能得出的结论。”（所有以上引用，皆引自列宁的言论——论共产主义青年团的任务）
    概括的说，它的基本内容是：吸收人类一切文化遗产作为学习的材料，用新的方法加以批判，去掉十分之九无用的，改正十分之一歪曲的，所剩下来的东西就是基本事业的知识及现代人类所不可少的一切事实的知识。这就是有目的、有立场进行由博反约的方法。
    青年是有知识的，同时又是能劳动的。前面所讲的是青年吸收知识的方法，下面就要讲青年劳动的方法。关于青年劳动的方法，列宁说：
    “一切青年男女参加礼拜六劳动，利用每个近郊的菜园以帮助人民；在乡村和自己的弄堂里，帮助清洁事宜和分配食物。这一劳动要成为有组织的劳动，从旧的学校中赶走旧的强迫制度，而代以自觉的纪律。……旧的社会里面，人人都是单单为自己而工作，没有一个人会留意到这里有没有老者和病人，是不是一切家庭工作都压在妇女肩上。共产主义青年团应当说要把这些加以改变。……现在五十岁左右的一代人，没有希望看到共产主义社会；而现在十五岁的一代人就可看到，并且他们自己将来要建设这一个社会，他们一生的整个任务，就是要建设这个社会。从十二岁起，就应当以自觉的和纪律化的劳动来训练群众。应当这样的来布置自己的学习任务，即在每个乡村、每个城市里，每天都应当在实践上来解决共同劳动的某一个任务，不论任务如何细小，如何简单（简单细小的劳动工作，并不妨碍学习，并且是一个经常性的群众性的工作，可以集小成大——作者注）。”
    总之，我们的方法不外是理论与实践的结合。
    上面所谈的方法仅是一般的原则问题，至于干部教育、群众教育、旧知识分子的改造诸问题，无法在这里具体提出，非另列专题不能解决。
