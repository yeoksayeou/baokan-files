    Episode Five: The New Son-in-Law (Continued-2)
    After a while, the old man came over, holding a stack of "good clothes," and Xiao Shui came with a new hat and new shoes, grinning. The old man said, "Da Shui, quickly put them on! The sedan chair is here, time to go get the bride!" Da Shui looked at them. A black market cloth long gown, blue market cloth cotton pants, leg wraps... Da Shui said, "Wow, what will I look like wearing these? I won't wear them!" The old man coaxed him, "Good boy, quickly try them on!" Others helped busily, forcing Da Shui to change. Da Shui looked. The cotton pants were too long, the cotton gown too short, exposing a large section of cotton pant legs. Xiao Shui put a little red-topped melon-rind hat on his head, perched on his big head, it wouldn't go down. The old man happily said, "Good, good, good! Looks like a new son-in-law." Da Shui pouted, threw the little hat away, and said, "This is like playing a monkey, I won't wear it!" Saying that, he started unbuttoning and taking off his clothes. The old man was anxious, grabbed his hand, and said, "You take them off, you take them off! I borrowed and scraped from everyone with great difficulty to get this set, if you don't wear it, what will you wear?" Da Shui said with a mournful face, "I'm a cadre of the Eighth Route Army, I'll wear this!" Everyone laughed and tried to persuade him. Xiao Shui put the little melon-rind hat on him again. Da Shui saw the sweat on the old man's head, panting, tired, sitting to one side, and then complied and buttoned up the clothes. But the box cannon was still tucked in his waist. Others laughed at him, "Marrying a wife and still carrying a gun?" Da Shui said, "The superiors said: The gun never leaves the person, the person never leaves the gun!"
    It was lively when Black Lao Cai came. As soon as he saw Da Shui's father, he repeatedly said "Congratulations, congratulations!" Then he saw Niu Da Shui. Da Shui stretched out both arms and said, "Cousin, look, they've dressed me up like this!" This made Lao Cai laugh, saying, "Isn't this good? A new son-in-law!" The old man pulled Black Lao Cai aside, and whispered, "Uncle! I was originally going to accompany you on the trip, but just now there was a message saying that the enemy might be moving out on the west side, so I have to transfer some guerrillas to guard the west side. You take care of your affairs. I'll come to see you later!" Da Shui heard this and quickly said, "Cousin, shall I go?" Black Lao Cai laughed and said, "You don't need to go! Gao Tun'er is over there. You be a good new son-in-law!"
    Gao Tun'er's mother, with a little white silk bun with a red flower stuck in it, was invited to "press the sedan," and she pulled Da Shui and said, "Let's get in the sedan chair quickly! It's getting late!" Da Shui said, "How am I riding in a sedan chair?" The old woman said amusedly, "If you don't ride in a sedan chair, will you run on two legs?" Black Lao Cai hadn't left yet, so he quickly said, "I borrowed a horse. If you don't ride in a sedan chair, you can ride this horse! Bring it back when you're done. I can also borrow a bicycle." Uncle Li from the neighborhood said, "That's right! It's good for the Eighth Route Army to ride a horse!" Everyone said, "That's fine!" Black Lao Cai left the horse and left. The old woman swayed into the colorful sedan chair, Da Shui got on the horse, the old man told him a few words, the two bands started playing, and several people went to Xie Liu Village.

    Da Shui rode on the horse, pondering all the way: "It's so funny! I was still kept in the dark yesterday, and today I'm getting married! Cuihua! What kind of person is she? Is she as good as Xiao Mei? Alas! It's already like this, just bear it! Anyway, I have to teach her to read and pull her out to work!"
    Led by the bands, a colorful sedan chair, a red horse, and several wedding-goers went north along the water inlet, walking the levee. There were willow trees along the levee, and the fresh green willow branches gently brushed the water surface. A small boat lightly floated across the water surface; the young man rowing the boat was singing "Swinging":
    In March,
    It's Qingming.
    The peach and apricot blossoms are over,
    And the willow branches are turning green.
    Little bees are gathering flower nectar,
    The flower nectar is stirring,
    Um, ai yo...
    The song followed the small boat, drifting further and further away...
    Xie Liu Village was already visible, Da Shui thought again: "Ha! Marriage! What does marriage taste like?" Thinking and thinking, he couldn't help but laugh.
    Entering Xie Liu Village, almost at the crossroads, suddenly they heard gunfire. The wedding-goers all stopped in fright, and saw the people running around in panic. Da Shui was on the horse, just about to ask what was happening, when he saw many Japanese soldiers in yellow uniforms coming from the other end of the street. People were in great chaos. Da Shui turned his horse's head and ran.
    Running to the entrance of the village, who knew that enemies also came from the left, shouting something at him. Da Shui kicked the horse hard, while pulling out his gun, and rushed forward. The melon-rind hat on top of his bare head flew off. Bullets were shot at his backside. Da Shui anxiously turned his head on the horse and fired a few shots. The enemy stumbled a bit, and then chased forward. Da Shui was already running on the levee. The enemy chased to the levee. Da Shui had already run far away, kicking up dust all the way; his silhouette disappeared in the dust...
    That day, the enemy pretended to attack the west, drawing away the guerrillas; a group of enemies from the town suddenly inserted themselves here. They burned, killed, and looted in Xie Liu Village; seeing the people holding a wedding, they looked for the bride. A Japanese squad leader named Iino raped Cuihua; followed by many Japanese soldiers...
    In the middle of the night, a girl with disheveled hair crawled to the well, sobbed and cried for a while, and then plunged headlong into the well. Cuihua... sacrificed! (To be continued)

    Da Shui went to greet the bride, and the result was shooting and running.

　　新儿女英雄传
    袁静　孔厥
    第五回　新女婿　（续二）
    一会儿，老爹捧着一叠“好衣裳”，小水拿着新帽和新鞋，笑嘻嘻的过来。老爹说：“大水，快穿上！轿子来了，这就迎亲去呀！”大水一瞧，是黑市布长袍，蓝市布棉裤，扎腿带儿……。大水说：“吓，穿上这些象个什么呀？我不穿！”老爹哄着他：“好孩子，快穿上试试！”旁人七手八脚的帮忙，硬给大水换上了。大水看着，棉裤子太长，棉袍儿又太短，露出一大节棉裤腿儿。小水又把红顶子瓜壳小帽往他头上一扣，顶在他大脑瓜儿上，戴不下去。老爹快活的说：“好好好！象个新姑爷啦。”大水噘着嘴，把小帽儿一丢，说：“这是耍猴儿呢，我不穿！”说着就解扣子，脱衣裳。老爹急了，抓住他的手说：“你脱你脱！我好容易东家借，西家凑，弄来这一套，你不穿，你穿什么呀？”大水哭丧着脸说：“我是八路军的干部，穿这个！”旁人都笑着劝他。小水又把那顶小帽壳儿给他扣上了。大水看老爹头上冒着汗，喘着气，累得坐在一边了，也就依顺着把衣服扣上了。可是那把盒子枪，仍旧掖在腰里。旁人笑他：“娶媳妇儿还带个枪？”大水说：“上级说的：枪不离人，人不离枪嘛！”
    正热闹呢，黑老蔡来了。一见大水爹，就连说“恭喜恭喜”；又看见牛大水，大水伸开两支胳膊说：“表哥你看，他们把我打扮成这个样儿！”可把老蔡笑坏了，说：“这还不好？新女婿嘛！”老爹拉着黑老蔡，笑嘻嘻的说：“什么都妥了，就等你这个伴郎呢。”黑老蔡把老头儿拉在一边，小声说：“舅！我本来准备陪着走一趟的，刚才有个信儿，说西边有可能敌人要出动，我得调些游击队，到西边去警戒，你们办你们的事儿吧。我以后再来看你们！”大水听见了，忙说：“表哥，我去不去？”黑老蔡笑着说：“你就不用去啦！那边有高屯儿呢。你好好儿当你的新姑爷吧！”
    高屯儿老娘，白丝丝的小髻儿上插了一朵红花，是请来压轿的，拉着大水说：“咱们快上轿吧！时候不早啦！”大水说：“怎么我还坐轿啊？”老娘好笑说：“你不坐轿，还两条腿跑呀？”黑老蔡还没走，忙说，“我借来了一匹马。你不坐轿，你就骑这匹马吧！完了事儿再捎来。我另外借一辆自行车也行。”街坊李二叔说：“对啦！八路军骑马才好呢！”大家都说：“行喽！”黑老蔡留下马走了。老婆儿扭扭摆摆的进了彩轿，大水上了马，老爹嘱咐了他几句，两个吹鼓手吹打起来，几个人就往斜柳村去了。

    大水骑在马上，一路寻思：“真好笑！昨天还蒙在鼓里呢，今儿就娶媳妇啦！翠花儿！她是怎么个人呢？有小梅那么好吗？唉！已然这么啦，就待着吧！反正我得叫她识字，还得拉她出来工作！”
    吹鼓手引着，一顶彩轿，一匹红马，几个迎亲的人儿，沿水淀往北，走大堤。堤边都是柳树，鲜绿的柳条儿轻轻拂着水面。水面上有一条小船儿轻轻荡过去；划船的小伙子在唱“打秋千”：
    三月里，
    是清明。
    桃杏花开罢，
    柳条儿又发青。
    小蜜蜂儿采花心，
    花心儿乱动，
    嗯哎哟……
    歌声随着小船儿，越去越远……
    已经望得见斜柳村了，大水又想：“哈！结婚！结婚是个什么滋味儿呢？”想着想着，不知不觉的笑起来啦。
    进了斜柳村，快到十字街口了，忽然听见枪响，迎亲的人都惊慌的站住，就看见老百姓纷纷乱跑。大水在马上，正想问什么事，一眼看见街那头来了许多穿黄军装的鬼子兵。人们大乱。大水拨转马头就跑。
    跑到村口，谁知道左边也来了敌人，对他不知叫唤些什么。大水紧踢着马，一面掏枪，一面直往前窜；顶在光脑瓜上的帽壳儿都飞掉了。后面兜屁股枪打来。大水在马上着急的回头打了几枪，敌人爬了一下，就往前追。大水已经在堤上跑。敌人追到堤上。大水早跑远了，一路卷起灰尘；人影儿没在灰尘里了……
    这一天，敌人是假装进攻西边，把游击队吸引过去了；市镇上一股敌人，突然插到这边来。在斜柳村烧杀抢掠；看见老百姓办喜事，就找新娘子。有个鬼子小队长，叫饭野的，把翠花儿糟蹋了；接着又是许多鬼子……
    半夜，一个披头散发的女孩儿，爬到井跟前，抽抽噎噎的哭了一阵，就一头栽下井去。翠花儿……牺牲了！　　　（未完）
