　　Restricting Grain Brewing and Practicing Strict Economy
  　Hebei-Shandong-Henan Tax Bureau Holds Liquor Industry Conference
    [Hebei-Shandong-Henan Dispatch] The District Tax Bureau convened a specialized liquor industry conference in Heze, gathering over sixty key cadres from affiliated distilleries. The conference summarized the work experience of the past year and focused on discussing the specific steps and methods for the specialized liquor industry to develop towards enterprise management. It was unanimously recognized that the purpose of the liquor monopoly is mainly to control grain, practice strict economy, and restrict consumption. Grain should be used in a planned manner, and fruit-based wine production should be encouraged to save grain consumption and support the war. Strictly prohibiting private brewing and implementing a high tax policy on liquor are also in line with this spirit and the restriction of luxury consumption by a few. For example, during the spring famine season from January to April this year, distilleries brewed only over 940,000 catties of liquor, a decrease of more than half compared to the same period last year. This shows that state-owned distilleries have achieved reduced production and sales, and conserved grain. However, some private merchants, for profit and the needs of a few, are secretly brewing private liquor, undermining the grain policy, and aggravating the threat of grain shortages to the lives of the broad masses of people. Therefore, it is now essential to strictly eliminate private liquor, vigorously develop the specialized market, and establish specialized liquor industry branches and specialized sales offices. Promote public liquor, and strengthen the investigation and management of private liquor. After each distillery improves from the current situation of undifferentiated production and sales to separate production and sales, they should strive to improve technology, improve quality, and reduce costs. Last year, the number of distilleries in Hebei had been reduced from 41 to 10 this spring; brewing stoves were reduced from 51 to 20. Manufacturing costs have been relatively reduced. In terms of materials, last spring each catty of liquor used 2 catties and 13 taels of sorghum, 13 taels of flour, and 2.5 catties of firewood; while this spring each catty of liquor used 2 catties and 7 taels of sorghum, 11 taels of flour, and 2 catties of firewood, greatly saving raw materials. Over the past year, approximately 1.2 million catties of grain have been saved. In the future, in addition to gradually improving tools, a trade union will be established to mobilize workers to participate in factory management and further improve technology. The production and sales monopoly work in the Henan area will also be planned, established and expanded.

　　限制粮食酿酒厉行节约
  　冀鲁豫税务局召开酒业会议
    【冀鲁豫电】区税务局召集所属酒厂主要干部六十余人，在菏泽开专卖酒业会议。会议总结了一年来的工作经验，并着重的讨论了专卖酒业应向企业化发展的具体步骤和办法，且一致认识到酒专卖的目的：主要在于掌握粮食，厉行节约，限制消费。要有计划的使用粮食，奖励以果类制酒，节省粮食消耗，以支援战争。严禁私酒和实行酒类高税政策，也是本此精神与限制少数人的奢侈消费的。如本年一月至四月的春荒季节，各酒厂酿酒仅九十四万余斤，较之去年同时期已减低二分之一以上。这就说明了公营酒厂已做到少制少销，节约粮食了，但仍有一些私商却为了营利和少数人的需要，偷烧私酒，破坏粮食政策，加重粮荒对广大人民生活的威胁。因此今后必须严格肃清私酒，大力开辟专卖市场，成立专卖酒业分公司及专卖处。推销公酒，加强对私酒的查缉和管理。各酒厂从现有的产销不分情况，改进到产销分开以后，应再力求改进技术，提高质量，降低成本。去年河北的酒厂已从四十一处紧缩为今春的十处；烧锅从五十一口减少至二十口。制造成本已相对的减低。用料方面去春每斤酒用红粮二斤十三两，面十三两，柴二斤半；而今春每斤酒用红粮二斤七两，面十一两，柴二斤，大大节省了原料。一年来节省粮食约在一百二十万斤以上，今后在工具上除逐步改良外并将成立职工会，发动职工参加管理工厂，进一步提高技术。对于河南在区的产销专营工作，亦即有计划的设置与展开。
