　　Exterminate Insect Pests with All Our Might!
    Currently, insect pests have occurred in some areas of North China, seriously threatening this year's summer and autumn harvests. Some areas, through the joint efforts of local Party, government, army, and people, have gradually eradicated the pests, while other areas, due to insufficient attention or other reasons, have seen the continued spread of the pests. The lack of rain and snow last winter and this spring made the occurrence of insect pests expected. This newspaper has repeatedly sounded the alarm, and now the Agricultural Department of the North China People's Government has specifically issued instructions on exterminating insect pests, hoping that leaders and the broad masses in all localities will pay close attention and earnestly implement them.
    North China often suffers from drought, and insect plagues of varying degrees occur every year. Under the leadership of the Party and the People's Government, the peasants in the old liberated areas of North China have gained rich experience in eliminating insect plagues. In 1944, a severe locust plague occurred in 23 counties of the Taihang area, threatening the crops of 879 villages. The Party and the government mobilized and led 250,000 organized peasants to launch the famous locust extermination campaign. In ten counties alone, 18.35 million catties of locusts were eliminated. The struggle at that time was very fierce. The fields that had been eaten by locusts were replanted at any time, and areas where locusts were continuously discovered were caught and killed in time. After such a struggle for six or seven months, the people were victorious. The reduction in harvest in the entire region under such a severe locust plague was less than 10 percent, ensuring a fairly good harvest. Other regions also had similar situations and experiences. Now the entire North China region has been freed from the direct war environment, and war-related tasks have been greatly reduced. All major cities have been liberated, and existing scientific pest control technologies, medicines, and equipment can be utilized. These new favorable conditions, coupled with past methods and experiences, give us full confidence and strength to eradicate insect pests.
    We hope that all regions will conscientiously implement the points stipulated in the instructions of the Agricultural Department of the North China People's Government. We believe that the best way to eliminate insect pests is to prevent them before they occur. Various methods should be used to strengthen the connection between higher and lower levels. Where insect pests are found, report them to the higher authorities immediately, and the leadership should organize forces in a timely manner to thoroughly eliminate them. Eliminating insects is like preventing floods. Small breaches are easy to block, but large breaches require more effort to defend and are prone to spread and cause trouble. Therefore, leaders at all levels must not be paralyzed by this, and should deal with insect pests with the spirit of being responsible to the people, just like fighting a war. The Agricultural Department has already issued a large number of scientific medicines and equipment, and all localities should make good use of them. Once science is combined with the masses, it will produce great results. We hope that agricultural scientific talents will actively go to the countryside and use their enthusiasm and technology to help the peasants do this good thing. This is the time for you to show your skills and make contributions to the people, and it is also a good opportunity to integrate with the masses and serve the people. Don't miss it lightly. On the other hand, our current scientific medicines and equipment are still limited and cannot be solely relied upon to eliminate all insect pests. Therefore, the folk medicines and methods that are already available and effective for killing insects should continue to be used and widely promoted. This is a large amount, and therefore powerful, and must not be ignored, abandoned, or missed, resulting in lost opportunities.

### 全力扑灭虫害！

　　全力扑灭虫害！
    目前华北若干地区发生虫害，严重地威胁着今年的夏收和秋收。有些地区经当地党政军民协力扑灭，已经渐次肃清，有些地区因为注意不够或其他原因，致虫害有继续蔓延之势。去冬今春雨雪稀少，发生虫害原为意料中事。本报曾一再敲响警钟，现在华北人民政府农业部又特别颁发了扑灭虫害的指示，希望各地领导上及广大群众提起高度注意，认真贯彻执行。
    华北常常患旱，历年都发生或大或小的虫灾。华北老解放区的农民在党和人民政府的领导下，已经取得了丰富的消灭虫灾的经验。一九四四年，太行区二十三县发生了严重的蝗灾，威胁着八百七十九个村庄的田禾。党和政府发动与领导了二十五万有组织的农民，掀起有名的剿蝗运动。仅十个县就消灭了一千八百三十五万斤蝗虫。当时的斗争是很激烈的，已被蝗虫吃光的田禾随时补种，继续发现蝗虫的地区及时捕打，如此斗争了六、七个月，结果人民胜利了，全区在这样严重的蝗灾袭击下减收不及百分之十，保证了相当好的收成。其他各区也都有类似的情况和经验。现在华北全区已摆脱了直接的战争环境，战勤任务大大减少。所有大城市都已解放，已有的科学的杀虫技术、药品和器材可资利用，……这些新的有利条件加上过去的办法和经验，我们完全有信心、有力量能扑灭虫灾。
    我们希望各地区认真执行华北人民政府农业部指示中所规定的各点。我们认为：消灭虫害最好的方法是防范于未然。应利用各种方法，加强上下级之间的联系。何处发现虫灾，立即向上级报告，领导上应及时组织力量，彻底予以消灭。灭虫如防水，小决口容易堵塞，决口大了，防御就需更多的力量，又易蔓延贻患。所以，各级领导上对此切勿麻痹，应以为人民负责的精神，象作战一样的对付虫灾。现在，农业部已经发下了不少科学的药品和器材，各地应善为使用。科学一经与群众相结合，就会产生伟大的效果。我们希望农业科学人材踊跃下乡，用自己的热情和技术，帮助农民办这件好事。这是你们大显身手，为人民立功的时候，也是和群众结合、服务人民的好机会，千万不可轻易错过。另一方面，我们现在的科学药品、器材还是有限的，不能单纯依靠它扑灭所有的虫害。因此，对于民间已有的、用之有效的灭虫药品和方法，还应继续利用，并大量推广。这是大量的，因而也是有力的，万不可忽视放弃，贻误时机。
