	1. Modification Registration: Changes in the size of the house, reconstruction, collapse, land consolidation, division (if the application for registration is due to the sale of real estate, the purchased portion shall be handled according to the transfer procedures, and the remaining portion shall be handled according to the modification procedures). Changes in place names and house numbers, etc., must be applied for modification registration.
	2. Correction Registration: If errors are found after the real estate is registered, an application for correction registration should be made immediately.
	3. Cancellation Registration: After other rights are extinguished, an application should be made to the Bureau to cancel the registration of such rights.
VI. If government agencies, companies, firms, or social organizations apply for real estate registration, the person in charge or designated agent shall bring a power of attorney to the Bureau for processing.
VII. The right holder, obligor, or agent applying for real estate registration must bring relevant title deeds, name chops, and identity documents (household registration, service certificate, etc.).
VIII. The name of the applicant for real estate registration shall be based on the real name recorded in the household registration and shall not contain aliases or other names (those who have previously used aliases or other names in tax deeds for registration must provide evidence to apply for correction). If the applicant is a company, firm, temple, school, or social organization, a business license or registration certificate issued by the competent authority must be presented for verification.
IX. If a house and land are jointly owned by multiple people, the registration shall be jointly applied for by all co-owners, and one of them shall be jointly designated to hold the certificate. The remaining persons shall each hold a co-owner diagram retention certificate, and the share of each person shall be explained in detail to the Bureau.
X. If the applicant for real estate registration is the heir of the right holder or obligor, proof documents must be provided, or a certificate must be obtained from the police station of the applicant's place of residence.
XI. If the original title deed of the house and land is lost, and an application for registration is made, a notice must be published in the Beiping Liberation Daily for seven days declaring the original title deed invalid, and a letter of guarantee from a reputable shop must be obtained. If there is no case to check, a certificate from the police station of the public security bureau where the property is located must also be obtained.
XII. If the land ownership certificate or other rights certificate issued by the Bureau has been damaged or lost, and a request is made for replacement or reissue, it shall be handled in accordance with the following provisions:
	1. If a replacement is requested due to damage, the damaged original land ownership certificate or original other rights certificate shall be submitted.
	2. If a reissue is requested due to loss, in addition to handling in accordance with the provisions of Article 11, the reason for the loss shall be described in detail in writing.
XIII. Registration procedures:
	1. Check the cadastral map: The real estate right holder applying for registration must first go to the custody section of the Bureau to check the cadastral map, identify the location of the land, and check the dimensions. If discrepancies are found between the graphic and the actual situation, a re-measurement can be applied for. If the land location cannot be identified at that time, re-measurement procedures must be followed first.
	2. Fill out the application form: After the map check is consistent, go to the registration section, and the scribe will fill out the application form on behalf of the applicant, or the applicant will fill it out himself.
