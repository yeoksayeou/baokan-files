    Xinhua News Agency, Peiping, June 20th: TASS, Paris: On June 19th, the Foreign Ministers of the Soviet Union, the United States, Britain, and France held a secret meeting to study matters concerning Germany and Austria previously discussed in earlier meetings. The Foreign Ministers' Conference is scheduled to hold a plenary session on June 20th.
    Xinhua News Agency, Peiping, June 20th: TASS, Moscow, June 19th: Pravda correspondent in Paris, Zhuikov, wrote a dispatch entitled "The Purpose of the Paris Foreign Ministers' Conference," stating: It is very interesting to look at the impression the four Foreign Ministers' negotiations have created in broad strata of the world and the reactions of the broad public to the progress of these negotiations. At the postal station of the Soviet delegation in Paris, there are piles of letters written in French, German, English, and other languages. Here, there are declarations from larger world and national organizations, statements from public figures, and letters from groups of workers or individual scientists, farmers, pastors, teachers, and artisans. It has become a tradition for the people of the world to pour out their thoughts and wishes to the Soviet delegation whenever it takes the stage at international conferences. They regard Soviet diplomats as their defenders, appealing to them, and firmly hoping that the Soviet struggle for lasting world peace will find a path to protect the interests of all peoples.

    四国外长举行秘密会议
    【新华社北平二十日电】塔斯社巴黎讯：六月十九日，苏、美、英、法四国外长举行秘密会议，研究前此会议讨论过的关于德奥的事情。外长会议定六月二十日举行全体会议。
    【新华社北平二十日电】塔斯社莫斯科十九日讯：真理报驻巴黎特派记者朱可夫撰述题为“巴黎外长会议的目的”的通讯称：看一看四国外长的谈判在全世界广大阶层中所造成的印象以及广大公众对这些谈判之进展的反应，这是很有趣味的。在巴黎苏联代表团的邮站中，有着成堆用法文、德文、英文以及其他文字写的信函。这里，有较大的世界性和全国性团体的宜言，社会名人的声明，一批批工人或个别科学家、农民、牧师、教员以及手工业者写来的信。全世界的人民群众，每当苏联代表团在国际会议上登台讲话时，就向代表团倾吐他们的思想和愿望，这已成了他们的传统。他们把苏联的外交人员当作他们的保卫者，向他们呼吁，坚决希望苏联的争取全世界持久和平的斗争找到保卫各国人民利益的道路。
