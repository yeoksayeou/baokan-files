Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 3rd: Polish News Agency, Warsaw News: On the opening day of the Polish Trade Union Congress (June 1st), after the Soviet representative, the CCP representative Qian Junrui delivered a congratulatory message to the congress. When he paid tribute to the congress on behalf of the CCP and the Chinese working people, the representatives present welcomed him with cheers for Mao Zedong and the Chinese People's Liberation Army. Qian Junrui recounted his admiration for the reconstruction work in Warsaw and throughout Poland on the ruins caused by the Nazi invaders. He admired the labor enthusiasm of the Warsaw workers who were fully aware of their great goals, and who were carrying out their work and construction regardless of the atomic bomb threat from the imperialist camp. Qian Junrui said: We, the Chinese Communist Party and the laboring people, are advancing hand in hand with you. Under the leadership of Chairman Mao, we are winning one victory after another. The Wall Street tycoons, who are now mourning the six billion dollars stuffed into Chiang Kai-shek's pockets, have turned the United States into a huge arsenal for our People's Liberation Army. We have defeated the Truman Doctrine and the Marshall Plan in China. Following the liberation of Hankou, Nanjing, and Shanghai, the Chinese revolution will soon victoriously sweep across the country. Our victory will destroy the foundation of the imperialist camp in the Far East and will change the balance of power in the world. After the great October Revolution and the defeat of fascism in the Second World War, the victory of the Chinese Revolution will be the third great victory of mankind. Our victory is the victory of the international solidarity of the working class, the victory of proletarian internationalism, and the victory of the theories of Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin. In conclusion, Qian Junrui congratulated Marshal Stalin, President Beirut, and the Polish United Workers' Party. Qian Junrui's speech was warmly welcomed by the audience.

    【新华社北平三日电】波兰通讯社华沙讯：波兰职工会代表大会揭幕日（六月一日），中共代表钱俊瑞继苏联代表之后，向大会致贺词。当他代表中共和中国劳动人民向大会致敬时，与会代表以欢呼毛泽东及中国人民解放军来欢迎他。钱俊瑞讲述他钦佩华沙及波兰全国在纳粹侵略者的造成的废墟上的重建工作。他钦佩对自己的伟大目标有充分觉悟的华沙工人的劳动热情，他们不顾帝国主义阵营的原子弹威胁而正进行他们的工作和建设。钱俊瑞说：我们，中国共产党人和劳动人民，正与你们携手并进。我们在毛主席的领导下，正赢得一个接着一个的胜利。现正为装入蒋介石荷包的六十亿美元而悲悼的华尔街大亨们，曾使美国变成了我们人民解放军的庞大军火工厂。我们已在中国打败了杜鲁门主义与马歇尔计划。继解放汉口、南京与上海之后，中国的革命不久即将胜利地席卷全国各地。我们的胜利将摧毁帝国主义阵营在远东的基础，并将改变全世界力量的对比。在伟大的十月革命及第二次世界大战中法西斯主义的失败之后，中国革命的胜利将是人类的第三个伟大的胜利。我们的胜利是工人阶级国际团结的胜利，无产阶级国际主义、马、恩、列、斯理论的胜利。钱俊瑞在结语中祝贺斯大林大元帅，贝鲁特总统及波兰统一工人党。钱俊瑞的讲演，受到听众的热烈欢迎。
