    “Truth Travels Without a Visa!”
    Despite Distorted Reports by Reactionary Newspapers, Soviet Proposals Still Resonate Deeply
    The Soviet delegation received a letter from the "Friends of Peace" Society in Marseille, stating: "The Yalta and Potsdam agreements provided the basis for the restoration of a Germany cleansed of Nazis, a Germany that would never again harbor thoughts of revenge. We, along with millions of people, welcome these agreements.... We firmly believe that only by implementing these agreements can your meeting succeed."
    The National Committee of the French Intellectuals' Movement for Peace informed the Soviet delegation that it had decided to write to the four foreign ministers, reminding them of the memorable words in the World Peace Congress declaration: "We know very well everyone who treats agreements aimed at maintaining international peace as scraps of paper, everyone who opposes all proposals for negotiation and disarmament, and everyone who is armed to the teeth and exposes themselves as aggressors."
    Of particular interest are the many letters from Germany. They prove that the experiences of the post-war years have not been in vain for the German people: there, after the defeat of Hitlerism, the forces of democracy have grown stronger and stronger. The senders expressed to the Soviet Foreign Minister their protest against the Western powers' foreign ministers' refusal to allow representatives elected by the German people to present their views on the German peace treaty at the Paris Foreign Ministers' Conference. The senders requested the Foreign Ministers' Conference to consider the German people's desire to establish a unified and democratic state. It is noteworthy that such letters come not only from the Soviet occupation zone of Germany, but also from the Western occupation zones.
    Despite the bourgeois newspapers making every effort to prevent the masses from knowing the Soviet delegation's position or distorting it, the truth still resonates deeply. The most famous French scientist, Curie, said at the Peace Congress, "Truth travels without a visa!"
    Zhukov also mentioned some touching private letters, in which senders requested the Soviet delegation to convey their deep gratitude to the great Stalin, who is leading the worldwide struggle for peace.
    This is the reaction of the vast public around the world to the negotiation process that has been going on for four weeks in the Rose Marble Palace. Those participating in these negotiations cannot fail to notice that hundreds of millions of people are watching them with hope and the firm demand for ensuring lasting world peace.

### “真理周游不要签证！”  尽管反动报纸歪曲报道  苏联建议依然深入人心

    “真理周游不要签证！”
    尽管反动报纸歪曲报道
    苏联建议依然深入人心
    苏联代表团接自马赛“和平之友”社的信件说：“雅尔塔和波茨坦协定，提供了恢复一个肃清了纳粹的民主的决不再生报复之念的德国的基础，我们与千百万人民一起，欢迎这些协定……。我们深信，只有实行这些协定，你们的会议才可能成功。”
    法国知识分子争取和平运动全国委员会告诉苏联代表团说，它决定致函四国外长，向他们提醒世界和平大会宣言上的可纪念的话：“我们很知道每个把旨在保持国际和平的协定当作废纸的人，很知道所有那些反对一切主张谈判和解除武装的建议的人，也很知道所有那些武装到牙齿和暴露他们自已是侵略者的人。”
    非常有趣的是许多来自德国的信。它们证明，战后几年来的经验，对于德国人民不是空的：那里，在击溃了希特勒主义之后，民主力量的声势已愈来愈大。发信人向苏联外长表示，他们抗议西方国家外长拒绝让德国人民推选出来的代表，到巴黎外长会议上陈述他们关于对德和约的意见。发信人请求外长会议考虑德国人民建立统一民主国家的愿望。很有意思的是，这种信不仅来自德境苏占区，而且也来自西占区。
    尽管资产阶级的报纸，尽一切努力不让广大群众知道苏联代表团的立场，或是予以歪曲，但是，真理还是深入人心。法国最闻名的科学家居里在和平大会上说过，“真理周游不要签证！”
    朱可夫还提到一些动人的私人信件，发信人要求苏联代表团向领导全世界争取和平之斗争的伟大的斯大林转致深沉的感谢之忱。
    这就是全世界广大公众对于已经历时四周的玫瑰大理石宫中圆桌会议上谈判进程的反应。参加这些谈判的人，不能不注意到，亿万人民正怀着希望和保证全世界持久和平的坚持要求望着他们。
