　　Bolivian Tin Miners Strike
  　Reactionary Government Massacres Workers
  　National General Strike to Protest
    [Xinhua News Agency, Beiping, 4th] Reports from various sources: Bolivian tin miners in South America began a strike on May 29th in the Betinho district. The reactionary government sent troops to suppress it, resulting in armed conflict and the deaths of 100 workers, with 200 arrested. Currently, tin miners across the country are on strike, and railway workers have also launched a sympathy strike. At the same time, the Labor Federation has ordered a general strike, and shop workers and auto drivers have also begun striking. To prevent the situation from escalating, the reactionary government has ordered the implementation of martial law. The reason for this tin miners' strike is to demand the return to the country of 26 trade union leaders (including the chairman of the Tin Miners' Union, Li Qin) and many workers who were exiled to Chile.

　　玻锡矿工人罢工
  　反动政府竟屠杀工人
  　全国将总罢工抗议
    【新华社北平四日电】各方报道：南美洲玻利维亚锡矿工人于五月二十九日开始在贝庭诺区罢工。反动政府派兵镇压，发生武装冲突，致工人死亡者达一百人，被捕者达二百人。目前，全国锡矿工人均已罢工，铁道工人也举行同情罢工。同时劳工联合会已下令总罢工，商店工人及汽车司机也已开始罢工。反动政府为防事态扩大，已下令实施戒严。此次锡矿工人罢工原因，是为了要求把放逐到智利去的二十六位工会领袖（其中有锡矿工人工会主席里琴）和许多工人，送回本国。
