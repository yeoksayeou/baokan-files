　　Jiaoji Railway Actively Under Repair
  　Full Line to Open July 1st
    [Ping City News] The section of the Jiaoji Railway from Fangzi to Chengyang began repairs on April 12th. The ten large bridges and seventy-nine small bridges on this section are being worked on simultaneously, with the expectation that the entire line will be open to traffic by July 1st. Before the liberation of Qingdao, the Jinan Railway Bureau organized the Fang(zi)-Qing(dao) Engineering Office, leading four bridge construction teams and two track-laying teams, to repair this section of the line. After the liberation of Qingdao on June 2nd, another bridge construction team and a track-laying team were organized in Qingdao, each track-laying team consisting of approximately five to six hundred people. All workers are carrying out the repair work with great enthusiasm in order to welcome the Communist Party's birthday on "July 1st."
