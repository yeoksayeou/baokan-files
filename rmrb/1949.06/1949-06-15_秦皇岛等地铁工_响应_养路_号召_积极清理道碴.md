　　Qinhuangdao and Other Railway Workers
　　Respond to "Maintain the Roads" Call
　　Actively Clean Ballast
　　[From our own correspondent] The Pingjin Railway Bureau's employees have taken the call to "pay attention to road maintenance work" very seriously. The Qinhuangdao area has already begun actively cleaning ballast. The ballast at Qinhuangdao Station has not been cleaned for fifteen years. The ballast is underneath, and the soil is on top, so you can't see the sleepers and rail spikes. This has caused great damage to the sleepers and rails. During the cleanup, all employees from the locomotive, rolling stock inspection, engineering, electrical, and station departments, as well as students from the Fulin Primary School and employees' families, a total of more than seven hundred people, carefully divided up the sections for each person. Women also worked in pairs on a section, and primary school students worked in groups of five. Under the principle of not interfering with daily work, it is planned to complete the task in twenty days. Everyone's morale is very high now. Whether before or after work, and on Sundays, there are many employees, women, and children cleaning. An old worker from the locomotive section said, "This railway hasn't been touched for fifteen years, this time we'll give it a good turnover."
　　[Another report] The trade unions of Tangshan, Guye, Lutai and other stations and sections have successively mobilized all employees to begin cleaning ballast and carrying out major cleanups of the station yards.

　　秦皇岛等地铁工
  　响应“养路”号召
    积极清理道碴
    【本报讯】平津铁路局职工对“注意养路工作”的号召非常重视，秦皇岛地区已在积极进行清理道碴工作。秦皇岛站的道碴已有十五年没有清理过，道碴在下面，泥土在上面，看不见枕木和道钉。对枕木和轨条损失极大。清理中，机务、检车、工务、电务和车站各部门所有职工及扶轮小学的学生和职工家属等共七百余人，详细划分了每个人的段界，妇女也两人合做一段，小学生五人一段。在不妨碍日常工作的原则下，拟定二十天完成。现在大家情绪都非常高，无论上班前、下班后，以及星期日，都有很多的职工、妇女和小孩在清理着。一位机务段的老工友说：“这个铁道十五年没有动过，这次也叫他翻翻身”。
    【又讯】唐山、古冶、芦台等站段的职工会已都先后发动全体职工开始进行清理道碴和站场大扫除。
