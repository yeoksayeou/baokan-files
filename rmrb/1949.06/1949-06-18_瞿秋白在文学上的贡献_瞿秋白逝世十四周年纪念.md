Qu Qiubai's Contributions to Literature
    -- Commemorating the Fourteenth Anniversary of Qu Qiubai's Death

　　In commemorating Qiubai, we shouldn't solely mention his contributions to literature. However, this is the area I feel most capable of discussing, and it seems to be the aspect I talked about most with Qiubai during his lifetime, benefiting me greatly; therefore, I boldly use the title "Qiubai's Contributions to Literature" to write down my fragmented memories and thoughts.

　　Qiubai was one of the earliest to introduce Russian literature and also one of the earliest to introduce Soviet Russian literature. Although revolutionary demands allowed him to dedicate only a small portion of his time and energy to this work, what he has left us now is indeed considerable – two large volumes of "Hai Shang Shu Lin" (literally "Forest Above the Sea"). These were likely translated between 1931 and 1933 when he was in Shanghai. The enemy's White Terror had reached its peak at that time, forcing him to constantly move his residence. The final part of the translation manuscript of the poetic drama "The Gypsies" was probably lost this way. This is a great loss for us. To this day, there is no better translation of "The Gypsies," nor is there an equally good writing style to continue the unfinished parts of Qiubai's translation. Lu Xun once said: Qiubai's Russian proficiency and Shi Wen's cultivation may not be matched, so this piece of fragmented jade is likely to remain permanently incomplete.

　　"Hai Shang Shu Lin" contains many of Qiubai's translations of Gorky's essays, including Gorky's famous "Twenty-Six Men and a Girl." This translated piece should probably be regarded as the best not only among the same Chinese translations but also among the same translations in other languages. I have read three or four English translations of "Twenty-Six Men and a Girl" and feel that none are as good as Qiubai's Chinese translation.

　　At that time (1931 to 1933), because the enemy's White Terror was too severe, Qiubai rarely came out; and I, not being sure if I was being tailed by special agents, was also inconvenient to go to Qiubai's residence. However, we often met in a third party's place. I remember him once telling me that he planned to first translate Gorky's essays (social and literary) and then translate other Soviet literary theory works, but the most difficult thing was the lack of materials. This plan was ultimately not realized, which is also a great loss for us.

　　Qiubai had studied Chinese classical literature in his early years and had a deep understanding of ci and qu poetry, even being fascinated by them. However, precisely because he delved into classical literature, he deeply hated and resented the blocky Chinese characters and the literary style of classical literature. He first raised the issue of "mass language" and expressed outstanding views; he also spared no effort to criticize the neither-fish-nor-fowl "May Fourth literary style," giving it the derogatory name: Mule Literature. He underestimated the achievements of the New Literature in the twelve years after the "May Fourth" Movement, and several friends at the time disagreed with his opinion. I remember that the initial draft of "Long Live the Scholarly Warlords" was considered unpublishable by several friends and returned to Qiubai; it was only published after he slightly revised it himself (these things all happened during the period when the "League of Left-Wing Writers" still existed). One day, I met him somewhere and asked him: Do you really think that the New Literature in the twelve years after the "May Fourth" Movement is completely worthless? He replied: If you don't use a strong laxative, the slogan of popularization won't resonate! So, he himself didn't necessarily think that the New Literature in the twelve years after the "May Fourth" Movement should be underestimated, but in order to pave the way for the slogan of popularization, he didn't hesitate to overcorrect. But a year later, when discussing "The Problem of Mass Literature," his views were much more moderate. Twenty years ago, some issues in literary theory had not yet reached correct conclusions – at that time, the general theoretical level was not necessarily too high, so Qiubai's literary criticism at that time inevitably had some biases in some arguments, which we don't need to avoid for him; however, what we admire and should learn from him is his attitude of never stubbornly sticking to his own opinions.

　　Qiubai wrote two essays criticizing the so-called "Third Kind of People." These are excellent critical articles, and even now, they are worth studying as important documents.

　　I personally have also benefited a lot from Qiubai's guidance in writing. My earliest three novels (the so-called trilogy included in "Eclipse"), about two years after their publication, he had a long conversation with me about these three books, giving correct analysis and criticism. He wrote a detailed critical essay on my poorly written novella "Three People Walking": these were all very helpful to me. After "Midnight" was mostly written, he read the manuscript and specifically came to my house for half a day, pointing out some shortcomings that should be corrected and giving me encouragement.

　　Around that time, I suggested to him that he should squeeze out some time to write a brief history of Chinese literature, even if it was just a longer essay. Because, in terms of both social science and literary theory, and in terms of the foundation of Chinese classical literature, he should "not give way to anyone" in undertaking this "pioneering" work. At the time, he also had some intention to try, but he really didn't have time to read thread-bound books and write a systematic history of Chinese literature – even if it was very brief. Therefore, he planned to write some short essays on Chinese classical literature. "Random Talk" was written under such motivation. It's a pity that he didn't continue writing it later. This is also a great loss for us.

　　Qiubai's manuscripts, whether translations or essays, were mostly written with a cyan-colored pencil on Chinese bamboo paper, with carbon paper underneath, producing two copies at once. The handwriting was very clear. I have never seen a second person use carbon paper to write articles like this. I don't know if his original manuscripts can still be preserved now? If not, that would also be the biggest loss for the future revolutionary history museum.

　　Today, the revolution has won nationwide victory, Qiubai's wishes have been realized, and he should be laughing in the afterlife. We, the survivors, cannot help but recall the many martyrs who sacrificed for the revolution, and the tremendous price that the victory of the revolution has paid. If we cannot each do our utmost to consolidate and develop the fruits of the revolution, then we will be letting down the martyrs. The best way for us literary workers to commemorate Qiubai is to work harder and study harder, learning from his efforts and also learning from him.

　　瞿秋白在文学上的贡献
    ——瞿秋白逝世十四周年纪念
    纪念秋白，本来不应该仅仅提到他在文学上的贡献。可是，我比较的还能说几句的，而且在秋白生前我和他谈得比较多，使我得益不少的，似乎还在文学这一方面；所以我就大胆用了“秋白在文学上的贡献”这一个题目写出我的零零碎碎的回忆和感想。
    秋白是最早介绍俄罗斯文学之一人，也是最早介绍苏维埃俄罗斯文学之一人。虽然革命的要求使他只能分出极小部分的时间和精力来做这一件工作，可是现在他遗下给我们的东西实在不能算少，——两大卷的“海上述林”。这大概都是他在一九三一年到三三年之间译的，那时他在上海。敌人的白色恐怖那时达到了顶点，他不得不经常迁移住所。诗剧，“茨冈”的最后一部分译稿恐怕就是这样失落的。这是我们的一个极大的损失。直到今天，还没有更好的“茨岗”的译本，而且也没有同样好的译笔来续完瞿译本的未完成的部分。鲁迅曾经说过：俄文程度及得上秋白的，史文修养未必及得上，所以这一块残璧，大概是要永久残缺的了。
    “海上述林”中，收集秋白所译的高尔基的论文很多，还有高尔基的那一篇有名的“二十六个和一个”。这一篇译品，恐怕不但在中文的同样译本中应当推为最好，而且在其他各国文字的同样译本中，也是最好的。我读过三四种英文的“二十六个和一个”的译本，觉得都不及秋白的中文译本好。
    那时候（一九三一到三三年），为的敌人的白色恐怖太厉害，秋白很少出来；而我呢，不敢断定自己没有特务钉梢，所以也不便到秋白的住所去。然而，也常在第三者的地方和他会面。记得他有一次对我说：他打算先把高尔基的论文（社会的和文艺的）译完，然后再译其他的苏联文艺理论著作，可是最困难的一件事是材料难得。他这计划后来终于不能实现，这也是我们的一个极大的损失。
    秋白早年对于中国旧文学是下过功夫的，对于词曲都很有研究，甚至也着迷过。但是正因为是在旧文学中钻研过来的，所以他对于方块的汉字以及旧文学的文腔，是深恶而痛恨之的。他首先提出了“大众语”问题，发表了卓越的主张；他又不遗余力地抨击那非驴非马的“五四文腔”，给写一个嘉名：骡子文学。他对于“五四”以后十二年间的新文学的成就评价过低，当时朋友们中颇有几位不赞同他这意见。记得“学阀万岁”的初稿，有几个朋友就认为不能发表，退还了秋白；后来经过他自己稍稍修改，这才发表了出来（这些事都发生在“左联”还存在的时期）。有一天，在某处遇到他，我就问他：难道你真正认为“五四”以后十二年间的新文学一无可取么？他回答说：不用猛烈的泻药，大众化这口号就喊不响呀！那么，他自己也未尝不觉得“五四”以后十二年间的新文学不应估价太低，不过为了要给大众化这口号打出一条路来，就不惜矫枉过正。但隔了一年，在论“大众文艺的问题”时，他的主张就平稳得多了。二十年前，文艺理论上若干问题，还没有得到正确的结论，——那时候，一般的理论水平都不见得太高，所以，秋白在那时候的文艺评论在若干论点上有时不免有点偏向，我们正不必为他讳；但是，值得我们钦佩，而且我们应当向他学习的，是他的绝不固执己见的态度。
    对于所谓“第三种人”的批评，秋白写了两篇论文。这是卓越的批评文章，在现今它还是值得我们当作重要文献来学习的。
    我个人在写作方面，得到秋白的教益也不少。我的最早的三部小说（收在“蚀”中间的所谓三部曲），大约在出版后二年，他还和我就这三本书长谈过一次，给了正确的分析和批评，我的一个写得很坏的中篇“三人行”，他写过一篇详细的批评论文：这些对于我的帮助都很大。“子夜”写成大半后，他曾读了原稿，特别到我家里谈了半天，指出了一些应当改正的缺点，又给我以鼓励。
    大约也就在那时候，我曾经向他提议：他应当挤出一点时间来写一部中国文学简史，那怕是一篇长些的论文也好。因为，不论就社会科学及文学理论的造诣而言，不论就中国旧文学的根柢而言，他都应该“当仁不让”地来担负这个“拓荒”的工作。当时他也颇有一试之意，但是他又实在没有时间来翻阅线装书，写一部有系统的中国文学史——即使是很简略的，因此他打算写些关于中国旧文学的短论。“乱弹”这一篇就是在这样动机下写的。可惜后来没有继续再写。这也是我们一个极大的损失。
    秋白的文稿，不论是翻译或论文，大都是用青莲色铅笔写在中国竹纸上，衬着复写纸，一写就有双份。笔迹很清晰。这样用复写纸来写文章，我还没看见过第二人。不知道他的原稿现在还有得保存否？如果没有了，那也是将来的革命历史博物馆最大的一个损失了。
    今天，革命已在全国胜利，秋白的志愿是实现了，九原有知，他也当欢笑。我们后死者，却不能不追想到许许多多为革命而牺牲的先烈，革命的胜利曾经付出了多么巨大的代价。如果我们不能各尽其最大的努力以巩固并发展革命的果实，那就对不起先烈。我们文艺工作者纪念秋白的最好方法，应当是努力再努力，学习再学习，学习他的努力，同时也向他学习。
