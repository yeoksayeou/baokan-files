Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 7th -- The Enterprise Bureau of the Industrial Department of the Northeast Administrative Committee convened a joint meeting of managers and factory directors from its subordinate paper-making, cement, rubber, and ceramics companies from May 16th to 27th. The meeting determined that the general task for all companies going forward is to shift to normal production. The meeting held that, although the main focus of industry in the entire Northeast this year is recovery and construction, most of the factories under the Enterprise Bureau's system that have resumed work are now capable of transitioning to normal production. Therefore, in the future, with the exception of a small number of factories continuing recovery and construction, the others should focus on improving quality and reducing costs. On this basis, they should fulfill and exceed their targets, expand production, and shoulder the responsibility of accumulating capital and increasing industrial and mining investment for the state. The meeting reviewed the shortcomings that still exist in the past production of each company. For example, the raw material loss rate in the paper-making industry is still quite high. During the puppet Manchukuo period, the raw material loss rate was 10%, while now it is 15% at the Andong Paper Mill, and even higher at other factories. The equipment of the cement company is the same as that of Dalian, and the prices of raw materials such as ore and coal are lower than those in Dalian, but the cost is one-third higher than that of the Dalian Cement Factory. The quality of finished products in the rubber industry is still very low. In response to this situation, the meeting, based on the existing conditions of each factory and with reference to historical data, initially established standards for raw material consumption, quality standards, and output standards, in order to gradually move towards quota management. The meeting also held in-depth discussions on the use of state investment, and decided that investment should be mainly used for important projects directly related to production. The meeting criticized and corrected the past tendency of some factories to use most of the state investment for repairing offices, clubs, garages, and hospitals, while paying insufficient attention to the repair of factory buildings, machinery, and tools.

　　东北造纸等业确定总任务　转向正常生产　提高质量降低成本
    【新华社沈阳七日电】东北行政委员会工业部企业管理局于五月十六日至二十七日召开所属造纸、水泥、橡胶、陶瓷四大公司经理、厂长联席会议，确定今后各公司以转向正常生产为总任务。会议认为：虽然整个东北的工业今年主要是恢复建设，但由于企业局系统中复工的工厂大部分已能够走向正常生产，因此今后除少部分继续恢复建设外，其他应以提高质量、降低成本为中心，并在此基础上，完成并超过任务，扩大生产，担负起积累资本，为国家增加工矿业投资。会议检查了各公司在过去生产中仍存在的缺点。如造纸工业的原材料损失率还相当大，伪满时原材料的损失率为百分之十，现在安东纸厂为百分之十五，其他厂更大。水泥公司设备与大连相同，矿石、煤炭等生产原料比大连价格低，但成本却比大连水泥工厂高三分之一。橡胶工业的成品质量还很低。会议针对这种情况，根据各厂现有条件，并参照历史情况，初步订出了原材料的消耗标准、质量标准、产量标准，以求逐步走向定额管理。会议对国家投资的使用问题亦作了深入讨论，决定要把投资主要使用到对直接生产所需要的重要工程上去。对于过去某些工厂将国家投资大部用于修理办公室、俱乐部、车库、医院，而对厂房、机器、工具的修理反而注意不够的偏向，会议已予以批判和纠正。
