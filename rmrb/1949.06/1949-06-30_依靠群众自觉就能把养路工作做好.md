Relying on the Masses' Consciousness Can Ensure Good Road Maintenance

　　The exemplary example of the Qinhuangdao Station's road maintenance work published in today's newspaper is worthy of appreciation and attention.

　　It is worthy of appreciation and attention because their actual labor achievements definitively demonstrate that under today's conditions, road maintenance work can be done well, and there are ways to do it well. All "shields" and claims that "the Ministry of Railways' requirements are too harsh" should be put away from now on.

　　The most deeply rooted problems were left over from the past within the station's lines, and Qinhuangdao Station was no exception; it is because their leadership can personally take action, rely on the masses, specifically divide sections, and earnestly assign responsibility, that they completed the task on time or ahead of schedule. Not seeing the power of the masses, fearing trouble, and fearing difficulties will prevent any work from being accomplished.

　　They conducted ideological mobilization among the workers, and the workers said, "If we don't take care of these things, who will?" Employees began to engage in labor with a sense of ownership. The leadership organized the employees of various units, elementary school students, and employees' family members. The work plan was discussed by the masses and became the masses' plan and concrete actions.

　　This time, Qinhuangdao Station, relying on the joint labor of the railway units' employees and the conscious after-hours labor of employees, completed the roadbed, which had not been renovated for fifteen years and extended more than ten kilometers - a rather arduous emergency task - and solved the shortage of manpower and time. However, the main responsibility for future routine road maintenance work falls on the shoulders of the engineering staff, and they must maintain the existing achievements and continue to work hard.

　　Qinhuangdao Station has provided us with very good experiences and methods. All roads and stations should learn from them, launch a road maintenance competition, and emulate Qinhuangdao Station! Rely on the masses and create more and better results.

### 依靠群众自觉就能把养路工作做好

　　依靠群众自觉就能把养路工作做好
    今天本报登载的秦皇岛站养路工作的模范例子，是值得宝贵与重视的。
    其所以值得宝贵与重视，因为他们以实际的劳动成果，确定的说明了在今天的条件之下，养路工作是可以做好的，有办法做好的。一切“挡箭牌”与“铁道部的要求太苛”的说法都应该从此收起来了。
    站内线路过去遗留下来的病根最深，秦皇岛站也不例外；就是因为他们在领导上能够亲自动手，依靠群众，具体划分地段，切实分工负责，所以按期或提前完成了任务。看不见群众的力量，怕麻烦，怕困难，是做不成任何工作的。
    他们在工人中进行了思想动员，工人说：“这些事咱们不管，谁管呢？”职工开始以主人翁的态度从事劳动。领导上把各单位的职工、小学学生、职工家属都组织起来。工作计划经过群众讨论，变成了群众的计划与具体的行动。
    这次秦皇岛站，依靠铁路各单位职工的联合劳动，依靠职工自觉的业余劳动，完成了十五年来未加整理延长十余公里的路床——相当艰巨的突击任务，解决了人力与时间的不足。然而今后的日常养路工作的主要责任，就落在工务人员的肩上，一定要保持现有的成绩，继续努力。
    秦皇岛站给我们提供了很好的经验与办法，各路各站要向他们学习，展开养路竞赛运动，向秦皇岛站看齐！依靠群众，创造出更多更好的成绩来。
