　　Grain and Gauze Transactions Scarce
　　Prices Decline
    [Ping City News] Recently, the amount of wheat entering the market in this city has increased. Yesterday, more than 100,000 jin were on the market at the Tianqiao market alone. Furthermore, because new wheat is about to enter the market, grain merchants and private flour mills in this city are eager to sell. However, buyers are mostly taking a wait-and-see approach, and transactions have decreased. Flour has fallen by more than 200 yuan per bag, and various food grains have also fallen by 2 to 5 yuan per jin. In order to maintain stable prices, the Trading Company also took the initiative to sell more than 160,000 jin of fine grains at low prices.
    Due to the liberation of Shanghai, general merchants believe that large quantities of gauze will soon be transported north, so most are taking a wait-and-see approach and transactions are also scarce. The price per bolt has fallen by about 1,000 yuan compared to the 2nd. Sundries and general merchandise have also fallen along with gauze and grain.

　　粮食纱布成交稀少
  　价格均呈下落
    【平市讯】日来本市小麦上市增多，只天桥市场昨日上市达十余万斤，又因新麦即将上市，故本市囤积粮商及私人面粉厂急愿出售，但买者多取观望，成交减少，面粉每袋下落二百余元，各种食粮每斤也落二至五元不等。贸易公司为掌握物价平稳，也主动低价出售细粮十六万余斤。
    纱布因上海解放，一般商人都以大批纱布即将北运，故多观望不前，成交亦少，每匹较二日落一千元左右。杂货、百货亦随纱布、粮食下落。
