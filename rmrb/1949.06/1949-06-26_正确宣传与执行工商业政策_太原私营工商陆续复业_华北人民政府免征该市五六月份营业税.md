　　Correctly Publicizing and Implementing Industrial and Commercial Policies
  　Taiyuan's Private Industrial and Commercial Enterprises Resume Operations One After Another
    North China People's Government Exempts the City from Business Tax for May and June
    [Taiyuan Dispatch] Under the clear protection and active support of the Military Control Commission and the People's Government, private industrial and commercial enterprises in Taiyuan are gradually resuming operations. As of the 16th of this month, according to incomplete statistics, they have recovered and developed to 1,475 households. Among them, 599 are industrial and handicraft businesses, and 876 are commercial businesses. In order to restore industry and commerce, the Municipal Government's Industry and Commerce Bureau convened a joint meeting of the directors and supervisors of the original Chamber of Commerce on each street on the third day after entering the city, and issued announcements and orders. Subsequently, it held separate forums by industry to vigorously publicize and explain industrial and commercial policies. In mid-May, the Municipal Government convened a forum of more than 400 representatives from various industries, where Mayor Pei Lisheng once again elaborated on industrial and commercial policies and gave detailed answers to the difficulties and suggestions raised during group discussions in various industries. At the same time, the Military Control Commission, after investigating that the nine iron factories under the Yan Bandit's Jinxing Machinery Company were privately owned, approved their full return. In this way, some of the doubts of industrialists and businessmen about our policy of protecting industry and commerce were gradually dispelled. The Electric Power Company further assisted in solving the problem of power supply, repairing lines, and refurbishing 96 transformers, 70 percent of which were for civilian and private factory use, enabling 148 private factories (including iron, electric grinding, cotton fluffing, oil pressing, electric welding, cold food, etc.) and businesses throughout the city to resume using electricity for power and lighting. Considering the suffering of the people of Taiyuan and private industrial and commercial enterprises from Yan Bandit's oppression and numerous difficulties, the Military Control Commission recently decided to reduce electricity charges by a quarter. The North China People's Government has ordered the exemption of business tax and war-effort rice for May and June; the Trade Company is using yarn to exchange for cloth, helping cotton mills solve the difficulty of raw materials, and has successively signed contracts with 20 of the city's 30 private cotton mills, and 72 looms have been or are about to be started. The Grain, Oil and Salt Department of the Trade Company organized 18 electric mills with 54 grinding plates to grind corn and sorghum on commission, so that they can make a profit. The Department of General Merchandise has prepared 5 tons of soda ash for use by private soap factories. However, some industrial and commercial households are still hesitating and waiting and have not yet resumed operations, and among those who have resumed operations, a few do not abide by government laws and engage in illegal activities such as speculation and profiteering, reselling gold and silver, or do not dare to let go of operations and development, and even change their names and underreport their capital. Many factories and shops have not yet agreed on wages, and are asking the government to stipulate wages. The Municipal Government and relevant departments are now continuing to actively assist in solving these problems.

　　正确宣传与执行工商业政策
  　太原私营工商陆续复业
    华北人民政府免征该市五六月份营业税
    【太原电】太原市私营工商业在军管会与人民政府明令保护与积极扶植下，陆续复工复业。至本月十六日止，据不完全统计，已恢复发展至一千四百七十五户。其中五百九十九户为工业与手工业，八百七十六户为商业。市府工商局为恢复工商业，入城后第三日即召开原商会各街理监事联席会，颁发布告、命令，继又按行业分别召开座谈会，大力宣传解释工商业政策，五月中旬，市府又召集各行业代表四百余人举行座谈，由裴丽生市长再次阐明工商业政策，并对各行业分组讨论时提出的困难和建议逐一作详尽解答，同时军管会查明阎匪晋兴机械公司所辖之九家铁工厂系私资经营，批准全部发还。这样，工商业家对我保护工商业政策的某些怀疑逐渐打破。电力公司更进一步协助解决动力困难，抢修线路，仅变压器即装修了九十六台，其中百分之七十均系民用与私营工厂专用，使一百四十八家私营工厂（包括铁工、电磨、弹花、榨油，电焊、冷食等）及全市商号得以恢复用电用灯。军管会为顾念太原市人民与私营工商业之受阎匪压榨，困难多端，近又决定将电费减低四分之一。华北人民政府明令免征五、六月份营业税与战勤米；贸易公司以纱换布，帮助棉织厂解决原料的困难，先后已与全市三十家私营棉织厂中的二十家订成合同，七十二台织布机已经或即将开动。贸易公司粮食油盐部组织了十八家五十四盘电磨代磨玉茭、高粱，使他们有利可图。百货部已准备好火硷五吨，供私营肥皂厂之用。但部分工商业户迄今仍在徘徊观望，尚未复工复业，已经复工复业者中亦有少数不遵守政府法令，投机倒把，倒卖金银等不法行为，或不敢放手经营发展，甚至改换字号，少报资金。许多工厂商店，工资迄未议定，要求政府规定工资。现市府及各有关机关正继续积极协助解决中。
