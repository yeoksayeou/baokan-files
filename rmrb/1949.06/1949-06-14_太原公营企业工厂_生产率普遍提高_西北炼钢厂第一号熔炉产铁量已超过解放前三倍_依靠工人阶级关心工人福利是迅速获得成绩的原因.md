　　Taiyuan Public Enterprise Factories
  　Universal Increase in Productivity
    No. 1 Furnace at Northwest Steel Plant's Iron Output Exceeds Pre-Liberation Levels by Threefold
    Relying on the Working Class and Caring for Workers' Welfare Are Reasons for Rapid Success
    [Report from this newspaper] Following their great contributions of heroically protecting factories during the artillery fire, actively participating in inventory work, and protecting the people's property, the staff and workers of Taiyuan's public enterprise factories have achieved many successes in over a month of resuming production. Because the staff and workers have begun to establish a master-of-the-house attitude towards labor and their enthusiasm for production is unprecedentedly high, the major factories and those with conditions for recovery have been able to overcome the production difficulties created by the Yan [Xishan] clique, realize the task of restoring production, and surpass the pre-liberation production levels. The nationally renowned Northwest Steel Plant began resuming work on the second day after Taiyuan's liberation. Currently, the iron output of No. 1 furnace has exceeded pre-liberation levels by three times, and the monthly steel output can also break the record of forty-eight heats. The successful trial rolling of "17-kilogram" light steel rails by the Rolling Mill Department is not only a major achievement of the plant but also a great contribution to the industrial construction of the North China region. Under the slogan of "Workers turn over, machines must also turn over," the Northwest Cement Plant has increased the average hourly production rate of each finished powder machine from 3.7 tons to 5.12 tons, an increase of 1.42 tons compared to before liberation. Under the same conditions and with the same number of people, Northwest Coal Mine No. 1 has increased coal production from 700 tons per day before liberation to 737 tons, even though the twelve-hour workday has been changed to a nine-hour workday. Currently, the mine's workers are striving for a daily production target of 900 tons. Taiyuan railway employees have now surpassed pre-liberation technical levels. The A-level locomotive repairs that could not be carried out in the past were completed on seven locomotives in May. The labor used for each B-level locomotive repair has been reduced from twenty-five before liberation to fourteen. The number of passenger and freight cars repaired has increased by one and a half times compared to April, and the number of traffic accidents has decreased by 33 percent. In addition, the Northwest Paper Mill, Northwest Match Factory, Taiyuan Textile Factory, Woolen Mill, Flour Mill, Jinhua Cigarette Factory, Northwest Printing Factory, and others have all resumed production, with improvements and increases in both production scale and efficiency.

    The above achievements are primarily due to the universal implementation of the policy of relying on the working class to carry out inventory work during the takeover process. This not only enabled the inventory work to proceed smoothly, but more importantly, it made the workers feel that they were the masters of the enterprise, raising their class consciousness. Therefore, their enthusiasm for production was unprecedentedly high during the resumption of production. Secondly, before the resumption of work, various factories universally held worker forums to widely collect workers' opinions. For example, at the worker forum of Northwest Coal Mine No. 1, workers put forward many positive suggestions for resuming production, such as changing Yan Xishan's large-scale coal mining method to forward coal mining to avoid injuring people and damaging the mine, and proposed issues related to a scientific division of labor system, which enabled the mine to guarantee and increase production even after shortening the twelve-hour workday to nine hours. After resuming work, Northwest Cement Plant, Northwest Steel Plant, and six other factories successively established factory management committees through democratic elections, which further improved factory management and promoted the enthusiasm and creativity of the workers. Thirdly, caring for workers' welfare. At the beginning of liberation, various factories immediately transported large quantities of food, grain, oil, and salt, and pre-lent them to workers to solve their immediate hunger. Furthermore, they began to review and abolish the unreasonable systems used by Yan Xishan to control workers. For example, Northwest Coal Mine No. 1 abolished the six major certificates (i.e., national ID card, conscription deferment certificate, combat certificate, worker's certificate, pass, etc.) that workers had to carry when leaving the mine, giving workers freedom of movement; changed the twelve-hour workday to a nine-hour workday to protect workers' health; and rationally resolved the treatment of diseases and the handling of work-related disabilities. Jinhua Cigarette Factory abolished the external inspection system to respect the workers' dignity. Northwest Steel Plant also established a workers' canteen, which increased from 102 people to 504 people on the second day, solving the long-standing problem of workers not being able to find a place to eat. In addition, individual units such as Northwest Coal Mine No. 1 also provided loans to support the production of workers' families in order to reduce the burden and difficulties of the workers. Therefore, workers unanimously reflected from their personal experience, saying: "The factory is our own home, the Communist Party is our savior, what else can we say but work hard and produce!"

　　太原公营企业工厂
  　生产率普遍提高
    西北炼钢厂第一号熔炉产铁量已超过解放前三倍
    依靠工人阶级关心工人福利是迅速获得成绩的原因
    【本报讯】太原市公营企业工厂职工继炮火中英勇护厂、积极参加清点工作、保护人民资财的伟大贡献后，在一月余的复工生产中又获得许多成绩。由于职工们开始树立了主人翁的劳动态度，生产热情空前高涨，故各主要及有条件恢复之工厂，均能战胜阎匪所制造之生产困难，实现了恢复生产的任务，并超过解放前生产水平。全国闻名的西北炼钢厂，在太原解放的第二天即开始复工，现第一号熔炉出铁量已超过解放前三倍，每月出钢量亦可突破四十八炉的纪录；碾钢科试碾“十七公斤”轻型钢轨的成功，不仅是该厂的重大创造，且对华北区工业建设贡献极大。西北洋灰厂在“工人翻身，机器也要翻身”的口号下，每部成品粉末机每小时平均生产率已由三点七吨增为五点一二吨，较解放前增加一点四二吨。西北煤矿一厂在同样条件与人数下，虽改十二小时工作制为九小时工作制，产煤量却由解放前日产七百吨增为七百三十七吨，现该矿工人正为日产九百吨的目标而努力。太原铁路员工现已突破解放前技术水平，过去所不能进行的甲级检修机车，于五月份完成检修七辆，乙级检修机车每台用工则由解放前二十五个减为十四个，检修客货车数量较四月份增加一倍半，行车出事次数则较前减少百分之三十三。此外如西北造纸厂、西北火柴厂、太原纺织厂、毛织厂、面粉厂、晋华卷烟厂、西北印刷厂等都已复工生产，不论在生产规模或效率上均有改进与提高。
    上述成绩的获得，首先是由于在接管中普遍执行了依靠工人阶级进行清点工作的方针，这不仅使清点工作得以顺利进行，更重要的是使工人们感觉到自己是企业的主人，提高了阶级觉悟，故在复工生产中，生产热情空前高涨。其次，各厂在复工前，普遍召开工人座谈会，广泛收集工人意见，如西北煤矿一厂工人座谈会上，工人对复工生产提出很多积极意见，如改阎匪大量采回煤为前进采煤法，以免伤人坏矿，并提出有关科学分工制度等问题，致使缩短十二小时为九小时工作后仍能保证并提高产量。复工后，西北洋灰厂、西北炼钢厂等六厂经民主选举又相继成立了工厂管理委员会，进一步改进了工厂管理，发扬了工人的积极性和创造性。第三、关心工人福利事业。各厂于解放之初，立即运到大量食粮油盐，预借给工人以解决眼前的饥饿；进而开始检查和废除阎匪统治工人的不合理的制度，如西北煤矿一厂取消了工人出矿必须携带的六大证件（即国民身份证、绥缓证、战斗证、工人证、通行证等），使工人有了行动的自由；改十二小时工作为九小时工作制，以保障工人的健康；并合理的解决了疾病治疗与因公残废的处理问题。晋华卷烟厂则废除了外出检查制，以尊重工人的人格。西北炼钢厂，并兴办工人大食堂，第二天即由一百零二人增为五百零四人，解决了多年来工人找不到吃饭地方的困难问题。此外个别单位如西北煤矿一厂并以贷款扶助工人家属组织生产，以减轻工人的负担和困难。故工人从切身体验中一致反映说：“工厂是自己的家，共产党是救星，不努力生产还有什么说的！”
