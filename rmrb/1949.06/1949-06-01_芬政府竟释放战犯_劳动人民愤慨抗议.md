　　Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, May 30th: According to TASS, the reactionary Finnish government released the major war criminal Risto Ryti in mid-May and granted amnesty to all war criminals. This reactionary measure has aroused the indignation and protests of all democratic people in Finland. The Palani local organization of the Finnish Communist Party recently held a meeting and passed a resolution demanding the establishment of a new government that is democratic internally and friendly to the Soviet Union. The Helsinki district organization of the Finnish People's Democratic League also protested. The Finnish democratic people's indignation at this matter has caused panic among the reactionary police authorities, who fear that the Finnish working people may hold protest demonstrations and have taken measures to protect Ryti. Note: Ryti served as President of Finland from 1940 to 1944 and bears primary responsibility for the crime of driving Finland to join Nazi Germany's war of aggression during World War II.

　　芬政府竟释放战犯
  　劳动人民愤慨抗议
    【新华社北平三十日电】据塔斯社讯：芬兰反动政府于本月中旬释放主要战争罪犯里斯多·罗蒂，并大赦一切战犯。此项反动措施已引起芬兰一切民主人民的愤慨抗议。芬兰共产党巴拉尼地方组织最近召开会议通过决议，要求成立一个对内民主、对苏友好的新政府。芬兰人民民主联盟赫尔辛基某区的组织，也提出抗议。芬兰民主人民对此事的愤慨，已引起反动警察当局的恐慌，他们深恐芬兰劳动人民可能举行抗议示威，已采取措施来保护罗蒂。按：罗蒂在一九四○年至一九四四年任芬兰总统，对二次大战中驱使芬兰加入纳粹德国的侵略战争这一罪行负有主要责任。
