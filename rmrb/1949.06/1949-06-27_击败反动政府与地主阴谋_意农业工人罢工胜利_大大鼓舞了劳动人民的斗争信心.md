Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, June 26th: TASS, Rome, June 24th: The 36-day strike struggle of two million Italian farm laborers and agricultural workers for the satisfaction of their legitimate demands ended victoriously at midnight on the 23rd. The strike paralyzed farm work in Italy and forced the government to finally take steps to resolve the dispute.

The Italian government issued a communique on the evening of the 23rd, announcing that the government had decided to submit a bill to parliament to enact legislation extending all agreements concerning the employment of labor in agriculture concluded in 1948 and now expired, to 1950. It also stipulated that during this period, all matters relating to the dismissal of agricultural workers would be submitted to the judiciary for consideration. The government's suggestion, which temporarily satisfied the workers' basic demand that dismissals must be based on "just cause," removed the most important obstacle in the way of resolving the dispute.

Representatives of the Agricultural Workers' Union, the Farm Laborers' League, and the landlords held a joint meeting on the 23rd, with the Minister of Agriculture and Labor also participating, at which an agreement was reached. The agreement stipulates the signing of a national contract, with the main provisions of provincial agreements to be included in the national contract. After the agreement was reached, the Farm Laborers' League called on farm laborers to end strikes everywhere at midnight on the 23rd. On the morning of the 24th, farm laborers in northern, central, and southern Italy resumed work.

Vittorio, Secretary-General of the Italian General Confederation of Labor, expressed satisfaction with the agreement in a statement to the press. He said: "The struggle waged by Italian agricultural workers and farm laborers this time will be recorded in the history of the Italian trade union movement. This strike ended with the victory of the farm laborers and the defeat of the reactionary landlords, which is a very positive thing for all working people and democratic forces in Italy."

　　击败反动政府与地主阴谋
  　意农业工人罢工胜利
    大大鼓舞了劳动人民的斗争信心
    【新华社北平二十六日电】塔斯社罗马二十四日讯：意大利两百万农场雇工和农业工人，为满足其合法要求而进行的三十六天罢工斗争，已于二十三日午夜胜利结束。罢工瘫痪了意大利的农场工作，迫使政府终于采取步骤解决争端。
    意政府于二十三日晚发表公报，宣布政府决定在议会提出法案，制定立法，将一九四八年缔结而现已满期的一切关于农业中雇用劳动力问题的协定，延长到一九五○年。并规定在这段时期中，一切有关解雇农业工人的问题，将提交司法机关考虑。政府这一暂时满足了工人关于解雇要出自“正当动机”这个基本要求的建议，除去了解决争端道路上最重要障碍。
    农业工人联合会、农场雇工联盟的代表和地主的代表于二十三日举行联席会议，农业和劳工部长也参加，在该会议上达到了协议。协议规定签订全国性合同，各省协定中的主要条款均应列入全国性合同之内。协议达成后，农场雇工联盟遂号召农场雇工在二十三日午夜停止各地的罢工。二十四日早晨，农场雇工在意大利北、中、南三部已恢复了工作。
    意大利总工会总书记维特里奥在对报界谈话中，对所获协议表示满意。他说：意大利农业工人和农场雇工这次进行的斗争，将记入意大利职工运动的史册中。这个罢工是以农场雇工的胜利和地主反动派的失败结束，这对意大利一切劳动人民和民主力量是一件具有非常积极意义的事情。
