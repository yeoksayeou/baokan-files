Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, June 20th: Reports from various sources indicate that municipal council elections were held in Trieste on June 12th. The Communist Party, suppressed by the US-British occupation authorities, secured 21.14% of the vote in the election, placing second in the city council, only behind the Christian Democratic Party, which is sheltered by the US-British occupation authorities. The Titoists utterly failed, receiving only 2.4% of the vote. Commenting on this matter, the Polish People's Voice pointed out that this clearly shows the serious weakening of the Tito regime and the true tendencies within the Yugoslav Communist Party. However, this is by no means the first sign of resistance against the Tito and Ranković police. The central organizations of resistance are growing within the Yugoslav working class. Yugoslav workers have become poorer, and their actions to strike for better living conditions have become increasingly frequent.

    的里雅斯特市选共产党人占第二位  铁托分子完全失败
    【新华社北平二十日电】各方报道：六月十二日，的里雅斯特举行市议会选举。受美英占领当局压制的共产党，在选举中获得了百分之二十一·一四的选票，居市议会的第二位，仅次于受美英占领当局庇护的基督教民主党。铁托分子完全失败，他们只获得选票的百分之二·四。波兰人民言论报在论及此事时指出：这鲜明地显示了铁托政权的严重削弱和南斯拉夫共产党中的真正的倾向。但是，这决不是抵抗铁托和兰科维奇警察的首次征象。抵抗的中心组织正在南斯拉夫工人阶级中生长着。南斯拉夫工人变得更贫穷了，他们进行罢工以争取更好的生活条件的行动已经愈来愈经常了。
