The Foxtail Millet Downy Mildew is a very common and serious disease in North China. When it first occurs, light yellow streaks appear on the leaves, and some white mold grows inside the diseased spots. Afterwards, the diseased spots gradually turn brown, split into filaments, and brown powder flies out from inside. Finally, only the leaf veins are left. Because its shape is very similar to an old man's white hair, it is called Downy Mildew. Generally, the heart leaves of millet affected by this disease are greatly affected in development. In severe cases, they often cannot develop a head, so some places call it "exposed heart disease" or "gun barrel." It also occurs after the head is extracted. The glumes of this kind of ear grow very fat and become needle-shaped, containing brown powder inside. The whole ear is fluffy and grayish-white, so it is also called "old millet" or "old man's head."

How is Downy Mildew transmitted? We can see a lot of brown powder on the broken diseased leaves and ears. When this brown powder falls on the ground, it is transmitted to the millet the following year through the soil. When mixed with the seeds, it invades the millet seedlings at the same time as sowing and germination. When the millet grows up, it will develop this Downy Mildew.

To prevent and control this disease, there are methods of selecting seeds in the field and soaking seeds in warm water, or using agents to eliminate seed viruses. There is also the rotation method, that is, the millet field this year will be replanted with other crops next year, and millet will be planted again after one or two years to reduce the occurrence. Both of these methods must be carried out before sowing or after maturity. The effective control method that can be carried out at present is to remove diseased plants. Because the diseased plants of foxtail millet downy mildew left in the ground, the brown powder in the diseased leaves scatters on the ground or mixes with the grain, which is an important reason for increasing the transmission of the disease. Therefore, removing and burning it before the brown powder in the diseased leaves scatters is also an important method of prevention and control. In the past, the removal of diseased plants could only be carried out after the millet had grown and the symptoms of the disease were obvious. Recently, the North China Agricultural Science Institute proved that after the seedlings emerge from the soil, in rainy weather, all millet seedlings with white powder on the back of the seedling leaves and slightly yellow leaves are sure to develop Downy Mildew in the future. If we thin out the seedlings after rain and remove the diseased seedlings with white powder on the back of the leaves, we can reduce Downy Mildew and increase yield in the future. The best time to remove them is when the seedlings have three or four leaves.

　　谷子白发病的防治法
    华北农业科学研究所病害室
    谷子的白发病，在华北是很普遍很厉害的病害。最初发生的时候，在叶上生出淡黄色的条斑，在病斑的里面生出一些白色的霉，其后病斑渐渐变成褐色，裂成丝状，从里面飞出褐色的粉末，最后只剩下一条条的叶脉，因为它的形状，很象老人的白发，所以叫它白发病。一般发生本病的谷子，心叶的发育很受影响，厉害的时候往往抽不出穗来，所以有些地方便叫它“露心病”或叫“枪杆”。也有在抽出穗以后发病的，这种穗子稃长得非常肥大，成为针状，里面包有褐色的粉末，全穗毛茸茸的带着灰白色，故又叫做“看谷老”或“老人头”。
    白发病是怎样传染的呢？我们在那破碎的病叶和病穗上可以见到很多的褐色粉末。这褐色粉末，落在地下，便经土壤而传染给来年的谷子，混在种子上时，就在播种发芽的同时侵入谷子的幼芽里，等谷子长大了便发生这种白发病。
    防治这种病害有田间选种和用温水浸种，或用药剂消除种子病毒的办法。还有轮作法，即今年的谷地，明年换楂，隔一、二年后再种谷子。以减少发生的办法。这两种办法都须在播种之前，或成熟之后进行。在目前能够进行的有效防治办法是拔除病株。因谷白发病的病株留在地里，病叶里的褐色粉末飞散落地或混在籽粒上，是增加病害传染的重要原因。因此，在病叶里的褐色粉末还未飞散时把它拔掉烧毁，也便成为一种重要的防除方法。以前，拔除病株都只能在谷子长大病征显著之后进行，最近华北农业科学研究所证明在幼苗出土后，遇上阴雨天气，凡是在苗叶背面生满白粉，叶了微带黄色的谷苗，将来一定发生白发病，我们如果在下雨以后间苗，把这种叶背长白粉的病苗拔除，将来就能减少白发病，增加产量。拔除的时间，以苗长三、四个叶子时候最为适宜。
