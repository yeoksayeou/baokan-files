　　North China People's Government Convenes Administrative Joint Conference
  　Drafting Specific Saving Methods
    [Reported by this newspaper] The General Office of the North China People's Government convened an administrative joint conference on the afternoon of the 4th to discuss specific methods for overcoming waste and implementing savings. Twenty-four units from various departments and directly affiliated organs attended, with over sixty participants including the chief secretaries and general affairs directors of each department. A preliminary summary was made regarding how to adjust systems, improve management, overcome waste, and implement savings, and further specific implementation plans were proposed.
    At the beginning of the meeting, Deputy Secretary-General Dong Yueqian pointed out: In the current situation where drought and insect pests are occurring in rural areas, affecting the reduction of the wheat harvest, it is of great significance for government departments to implement streamlining and savings. Since the government entered the city, financial expenditures have been increasing daily. Most working comrades in various departments still maintain our original hardworking and simple style, and there are few instances of corruption, degeneration, or excessively extravagant handling of affairs. However, it must be pointed out that the phenomenon of wasteful living in our various departments and organs still exists. The reasons for this are mainly due to insufficient attention to administrative management, insufficient in-depth inspection, a lack of experience among comrades in urban organ management, and the fact that the current organ financial system is not suitable for urban conditions. Deputy Secretary-General Dong further pointed out: Since Chairman Dong issued the call for savings at the beginning of last month, and various departments have responded enthusiastically after in-depth discussions, various departments have achieved preliminary results and experiences in saving. For example, the government itself generally uses very little public stationery except for external documents; the envelopes used internally are generally old ones, and some are even turned over and used four times. Now, glue is generally no longer purchased; everyone makes flour paste themselves. In May, bicycle repair costs were changed to be contracted by each small unit, and the number of public bicycle repairs has greatly decreased. Repair costs have dropped from 33 jin of rice per bicycle (in April) to 20 jin of rice, but more can still be saved. The Supervision Institute trained communicators to repair their own bicycles, with expenses only half of what was stipulated, and the communicators were also rewarded. After strengthening management and adopting methods such as education and rewards, the fuel consumption of the General Office's trucks has been reduced from 4 liang per hua li to 2 liang and 7 qian per hua li. The average fuel consumption for staff cars does not exceed 1.1 gallons per car per day (formerly 1.5 gallons). In April, the most economical units spent an average of 54 jin of rice per person on water, electricity, and sundry expenses, while some spent more than 80 jin of rice. After promoting savings in May, some units (such as agriculture and finance departments) are gradually approaching the prescribed standard of 22 jin per person. Now, the organ implements a lights-off system at night, and the phenomenon of electric lights burning all night has long been overcome. The temporary repair budget for a house built by the General Affairs Section was originally 280,000 yuan. After investigation, research, and accurate calculation, and adopting bidding and contract methods, the final account was only 190,000 yuan.
    Based on the materials provided by the Administrative Department of the General Office, the meeting drafted the following summary of specific saving methods: 1. In coordination with the current organ reorganization work, we should start by reducing the staffing of service and security personnel in each unit. The system of personal security guards and orderlies should generally be abolished. Civil servants should be appropriately adjusted and assigned in offices and dormitories. Redundant personnel should be incorporated into the security team, or sent to training classes, or reassigned to other work, so as to ensure proper resettlement. 2. Implement financial and material savings: (1) Each department's public sundry expenses should be contracted. Based on the actual situation, greater efforts should be made to save. (2) The number of public documents printed must be calculated accurately, and they must not be sent directly to the printing section without the approval of the administrative负责人 [responsible person]. (3) Unnecessary electric lights must be reduced, and the number of electric lights should be determined according to the average number of candles in each office, not exceeding 25 candlepower. Dormitories should uniformly use 10 to 15 candlepower. (4) The use of electric stoves should be abolished. There are still many electric stoves, which consume a lot of electricity. From now on, unless specially approved, public stoves should be used. Charging car batteries must be approved and electricity costs calculated. Everyone decided on four wants and four don'ts for water and electricity savings. Four don'ts: Don't turn on the lights before dark, don't turn on the lights without using them, use existing lights without installing new ones, and don't waste water when washing clothes. Four wants: Turn off the lights after going to bed, turn off the electricity after using the lights, consciously replace large candlepower lights with smaller ones, and repair them immediately after they are damaged. (5) Car allocation: Because the departments are scattered, it is temporarily stipulated that each department has one car (except for specially approved business vehicles). Cars are dispatched uniformly and managed separately. Gasoline is purchased uniformly and sold to each department at a par price. Taking a car should be done according to regulations. Without official business, cars should not be used indiscriminately. Establish a car business trip permit signing system and calculate gasoline according to the business trip mileage. Reward fuel-efficient drivers. (6) Bicycle repair costs should still be contracted by each department, not exceeding 20 jin of rice per bicycle per month. (7) Reduce the number of newspaper subscriptions. Each department contracts for an average of 3 jin of rice per person per month for newspaper expenses, and independently saves money to purchase books and magazines. 3. Improve management methods: (1) The expenditure of administrative management funds should be led uniformly and managed in a decentralized manner as much as possible. Each department and office should adopt a tiered contract responsibility system as much as possible. (2) Procurement and construction should appropriately utilize bidding and contracting methods. There must be investigation and research. The so-called "shop around and you won't be fooled." (3) Continue to study a number of living methods and implement the principle and method of benefiting both the public and the private, such as gradually moving towards a charging system for public dormitories and the use of water and electricity.
    The atmosphere at the meeting was enthusiastic. The comrades attending from the Ministry of Finance proposed compiling a "Savings Newsletter" to exchange information and experiences on the implementation of savings in various units, and everyone agreed to hold it. After the meeting, the departments of the North China Government are discussing specific implementation methods based on this preliminary plan, and some have already begun to implement it.

　　华北人民政府召开行政联席会议
  　拟订具体节约办法
    【本报讯】华北人民政府秘书厅于四日下午召开行政联席会议、讨论克服浪费，实行节约的具体办法。到各部门及各直属机关二十四个单位，出席各部秘书主任及总务负责人共六十余人。对于如何调整制度、改进管理、克服浪费、实施节约等作了初步总结，并提出了进一步的具体实施方案。
    会议首由董副秘书长越千指出：在目前农村发生旱象和虫灾，影响麦收减成的情况下，政府各部门实行精简节约具有重大的意义。政府自进城以后，财政开支日益增大，各部门一般工作同志仍保持我们原有的艰苦奋斗朴素的作风，很少发生腐化堕落及办事过分铺张的事实；但必须指出我们各部门机关生活浪费的现象，目前仍是存在着的。检讨原因，主要是由于行政管理上抓得不够紧，检查不够深入，同志们对城市机关管理工作缺乏经验，以及目前机关财政制度不适合城市情况所致。董副秘书长继指出：自董主席上月初发出节约号召，各部门深入讨论群起响应后，各部门已获有节约的初步成绩和经验，如政府本身除对外行文外，一般已很少用公用笺；内部所用信封一般都是旧的，甚至还有翻过来一个信封用四回的。现在一般已不买浆糊，都是自己作面糊。五月份自行车修车费改归各小单位包干，公家修车数已大形减少。修车费由每车三十三斤米（四月份）已降到二十斤米，但尚可节省。监察院训练通讯员自己修理自行车，开支仅及规定之半，通信员还得到奖励。秘书厅卡车用油，自加强管理，采用教育奖励等办法后，行车用油每华里已由四两减到二两七钱。卧车用油，总平均数每辆每日不超过一·一加仑（过去一·五加仑）。四月份的水电公杂费，最节省的单位，也要到平均每人五十四斤米，多的达八十余斤米，五月份提倡节约后，有些单位（如农业财政等部门），按规定标准每人二十二斤已渐接近。现在机关晚间实行熄灯制度，电灯通宵长明的现象早已克服。总务科所造一处房屋的临时修缮费预算原为二十八万元经调查研究精确计算，采用招标比价包工办法，最后决算仅用十九万元。
    会议根据秘书厅行政处所提供的材料拟订节约具体办法摘要如下：一、配合此次机关整编工作，目前先从各单位紧缩勤杂警卫人员编制入手，个人专用警卫员及勤务员制一般应即取消，在办公室及宿舍适当调整与配备公务员，编余人员编入警卫队，或送训练班，或改派其他工作，务使获得妥慎安置。二、实行财力物力节约：（１）各部门公杂费采包干制。根据实际情况，更加力求节省。（２）公文印刷必须精确计算数字，非经行政负责人批准不得直送文印科。（３）不必要的电灯必须减少，电灯度数，核定各处平均烛数，不超过二十五烛光。宿舍一律用十到十五烛光。（４）一律取销用电炉。目前电炉尚多，费电甚大，今后除非特殊批准者，均改用公共火炉。汽车充电瓶须经批准并计算电费。大家对于水电节约上决定四要、四不要。四不要：天不黑不开灯、不用灯不开灯、有灯利用不另按装、洗衣服不浪费水。四要：睡觉后要熄灯、用灯后要关电门、烛光大的要自觉换小、损坏后要立即修理。（５）汽车配备，因各部门分散，暂规定各部一辆（特殊批准业务汽车除外），汽车统一调度，分散管理，汽油统一购买，平价出售给各部，坐汽车按规定，没有公事，不得滥用汽车，建立汽车出差证签字制度，按出差里程计算汽油。节油司机加以奖励。（６）自行车修理费，仍采各部门包干制，每辆每月不超过二十斤米。（７）减缩报纸订阅份数。按每人每月平均三斤米报费由各部包干，自行节约订购，省下经费可买书籍杂志。三、改进经营管理方法：（１）行政管理经费开支尽量采统一领导，分散管理制，各部处尽可能采分层包干负责制。（２）采购修建，适当利用投标比价及包工办法。要有调查研究。所谓“货走三家不上当”。（３）继续研究若干生活方法，贯彻公私两利的方针方法，如公共宿舍及水电使用逐步走上收费办法。
    会议上情绪热烈，财部出席同志提出编印“节约通讯”，交流各单位实施节约的情况和经验，一致同意举办。会议后，华北政府各部门根据这个初步方案，正研讨具体实施办法，有的已开始实行。
