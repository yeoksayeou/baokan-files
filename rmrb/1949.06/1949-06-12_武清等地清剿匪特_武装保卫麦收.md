[Hebei Central Electricity] In order to thoroughly eliminate the hidden bandits and special agents, the Wuqing County Party Committee specifically planned joint defense and clearing work in early May. A joint clearing office was established, responsible for directing the county's clearing work. It promoted all districts to rely on and mobilize the masses, universally organizing militia armed forces to launch joint defense and clearing operations. The County Party Committee divided the county into three areas, leading each with a focus. In villages without militias, laboring poor peasants were the backbone to organize firearms and spears to establish peasant armed forces. After half a month, 80% of the villages in the county had organized joint defense armed organizations and launched a sharp struggle against bandits and special agents. On the night of the 25th of last month, several bandits stole a rubber-wheeled cart and a mule from Liu Village in the Sixth District. After discovering this, the militia bravely pursued them for eighty miles and finally recovered the items and captured one bandit. In addition, armed bandits and special agents were discovered in Pang Village in the Fourth District and Wang Tang Village in the Seventh District, and they were captured with the assistance of the surrounding villagers' militia. Currently, the villages are actively organizing and expanding the anti-bandit armed forces. In Wang Tang Village, with 140 households, 21 armed groups have been organized, all carrying large guns, firearms, spears, and other weapons. The peasants said, "As long as we have this, the bandits will definitely not be able to operate." The aforementioned captured bandits and special agents have been handed over to the county government for detention and interrogation. Now, the peasants of Wuqing County are combining the protection of the wheat harvest and further strengthening the joint defense and clearing work.

[Taihang News] Recently, shootings and robberies have continuously occurred in Bo'ai. Last month, the county's Armed Forces Department and Public Security Bureau held a meeting to study the social situation and root causes of problems in Bo'ai. Recently, Xinxiang was liberated, and some bad elements returned to their villages to hide and carry out various destructive activities. Therefore, the people's armed work and public security work must closely cooperate to stabilize social order. Specific measures were formulated: (1) Establish checkpoints at major intersections to be responsible for checking pedestrians. (2) Establish and improve village security committees, and carefully register and review returned personnel. (3) Conduct in-depth investigations with a focus, and promptly solve cases upon discovering clues. (4) Village militia cadres frequently patrol at night to prevent the activities of bad people.

[Jidong News] The militia in Miyun's Second District continued the heroic spirit of past struggles against the enemy and unremittingly defended their homeland and the wheat production. On May 3rd, they took the initiative to cooperate with the local armed forces in encircling and annihilating the roaming cavalry bandits, and captured eight warhorses, rendering meritorious service. The Fourteenth Special Commissioner's Office and War Committee, in order to encourage the militia's enthusiasm for protecting their home area, in addition to issuing a circular to commend them, specially gave them material rewards. Han Yuhuan and four others from the first-class militia of Beizhuangtou Village were each awarded an American-style rifle, twenty rounds of ammunition, a hoe, and a certificate. Other militia heroes were also given various prizes. After receiving the awards, the militia heroes' enthusiasm for defending their homeland and protecting production became even higher.

[Suimeng Electricity] The mass-based anti-bandit movement in various counties of eastern Sui has achieved results in the past six months. Xinghe County cooperated with military clearing in various districts and launched a political offensive. Zhang Ying's bandit-security police force was defeated by our cavalry, and internal turmoil occurred. Seizing this opportunity, on the one hand, a meeting of family members of bandit soldiers was held, explaining our party's lenient policy, and on the other hand, we actively sought relationships to send letters, winning over the entire force of 37 people to surrender their weapons. In the past six months, a total of more than 80 people in the county surrendered their weapons collectively, and the total number of individual surrenders has reached more than 300, with a total of 450 long and short guns and more than 80 horses surrendered. The bandits in the whole county have been basically eliminated. In Fengzhen's Sixth District, there were 94 people including the puppet district chief Song Guangheng, who surrendered with 84 rifles, 10 pistols, and 29 horses. In military clearing, because mass work was carried out, the results were also increasingly significant. This spring, cadres and masses in the Baihaizi shoal in Jining's First District pursued bandits overnight, seized back the stolen cattle and donkeys and returned them to the masses, making the masses realize that the purpose of suppressing bandits is to protect their own interests.
