Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, June 23rd: Moscow Dispatch: *Pravda* published a dispatch from its special correspondent Zhukov reporting on the large-scale anti-fascist demonstration by the people of Paris, stating: The enormous political event that occurred in the southern district of Paris on June 18 vividly demonstrates the full tense situation of the French political landscape.

The Paris City Government, headed by Pierre de Gaulle, brother of General de Gaulle, who dreams of seizing power, passed a provocative resolution to hold a demonstration for General de Gaulle on June 18 (the anniversary of the liberation of Paris) that was essentially against the Republic. However, a wave of protests against the conspiracy of the de Gaulle brothers and their behind-the-scenes protectors swept Paris. The Association of Fighters for Freedom and Peace of the 14th arrondissement of Paris, the site chosen by the De Gaullists for the demonstration, called on all loyal patriots to participate in a counter-demonstration. The head of the Free French Navy during the war, the renowned French Rear Admiral Maurec, agreed to preside over this counter-demonstration.

On the morning of June 18, the strongest police, gendarmerie, and mobile forces ever seen in Paris were dispatched to the demonstration area. The total number of police mobilized to "maintain order" reached 25,000. It is worth noting that the main police force was not concentrated in the area where the De Gaullists held their demonstration, but around the mayor's office of the 14th arrondissement. In front of the office, about 200,000 Parisians crowded the entire square and nearby streets, where they held a militant and powerful rally to protest the increasingly rampant anti-republican actions of the fascists. On the makeshift platform were leaders of various democratic groups in Paris, well-known political figures and social celebrities, writers, scientists, and generals. Although they belonged to different political organizations and held different views on certain issues, they united their ranks in the face of a common threat.

In contrast to this astonishing demonstration of unity among all Republicans, the conspiracy of the right-wing Socialist Party and the Popular Republican Movement appeared extremely pathetic. They urged their followers not to participate in the protest rally. However, many rank-and-file members of these parties disregarded the orders of their leaders and participated in the rally. The resolution passed at the rally pointed out the great importance of the unity of Republicans, and called on all those loyal to the Constitution to show this unity with even greater force on National Day (July 14).

The conspiracy of the De Gaulle brothers, who wanted to become the masters of the streets of Paris and display their power, has failed shamefully. The working people of Paris responded to this provocation by closing their ranks even tighter and maintaining greater vigilance.

    反对法西斯分子反共和国活动
    巴黎廿万人大示威
    戴高乐阴谋惨遭可耻失败
    【新华社北平二十三日电】莫斯科讯：真理报刊载该报特派记者朱可夫报道巴黎人民反法西斯大示威的通讯称：六月十八日，巴黎南区发生的巨大政治事件，生动地表明了法国政局的全部紧张形势。
    以梦想夺取政权的戴高乐将军的兄弟比尔·戴高乐为首的巴黎市政府，通过了挑衅性的决定，在六月十八日（巴黎解放纪念日）为戴高乐将军举行本质上是反对共和国的示威。但是，抗议戴高乐弟兄及其幕后保护者的阴谋的浪潮席卷巴黎。戴高乐分子选择作为示威地点的巴黎第十四区的争取自由与和平战士协会，号召一切忠实的爱国者参加反示威。战时的自由法国海军总部的首脑著名的法国海军少将毛勒克，同意主持这个反示威。
    六月十八日晨，巴黎所从未见过的最强大的警察、宪兵部队和机动部队被派遣到示威地区。动员来“维持秩序”的警察总数达二万五千名。值得注意的是，主要的警察力量不是集中在戴高乐分子举行示威的地区，而是集中在第十四区的市长办公厅左近，在办公厅前面，约有二十万的巴黎市民挤满了整个广场和附近的街道，他们在那里举行战斗的有力的集会，抗议那些越来越肆无忌惮的法西斯分子的反共和国行动。在临时搭起的讲台上，有巴黎各民主团体的领袖，著名的政治人物和社会名流，作家，科学家和将军们。他们虽然属于不同的政治组织，并在某些问题上具有不同的见解，但是，却在共同的威胁前面联合了他们的队伍。
    与这个一切共和分子的团结的惊人的大示威相对照，右翼社会党和人民共和运动党的阴谋看起来极端可怜。他们力促其随从不要参加抗议集会。但是，这些党派的许多党员群众却不顾其领袖的命令而参加了集会。集会通过的决议，指出共和分子团结在一起的极大重要性，决议并号召一切忠于宪法的人在国庆日（七月十四日）以更大的力量显示这个团结。
    想要成为巴黎街道的主人并显示其力量的戴高乐弟兄的阴谋，已经可耻地失败了。巴黎劳动人民用更加紧密他们的行列和更高的警觉性，答复了这个挑衅。
