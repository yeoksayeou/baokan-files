　　On the Victory of Democratic China
　　The victory of democratic forces in China, indicates the bankruptcy of Wall Street's imperialist plans.
　　[Xinhua News Agency, Prague, 5th dispatch] The Soviet "New Times" magazine published an article by Telsky on May 25th entitled "The Events in China," stating: "The victory of the Chinese people in defeating the Kuomintang reactionaries instigated by American imperialism is a vivid demonstration of the success of the great democratic forces led by the Chinese Communist Party. The selfless dedication of the Chinese Communist Party to the great cause of liberation of the working people has freed the Chinese working people from the shackles of domestic and foreign oppressors for over a hundred years." The article pointed out that although the American rulers gave Chiang Kai-shek more than six billion U.S. dollars in aid, and in effect commanded his army and trained secret agents, the Kuomintang reactionaries still suffered a complete defeat. The article pointed out: "The victory of the democratic forces in China not only signifies the failure of the Kuomintang reactionaries, but also the bankruptcy of Wall Street's imperialist plans."

    中国民主势力的胜利，表示华尔街帝国主义计划破产。
    【新华社布拉格五日专电】苏联新时代杂志于五月二十五日刊载铁尔斯基所作“中国的事变”一文称：“中国人民击败美国帝国主义所唆使的国民党反动派的胜利，乃是以中国共产党为首的伟大民主势力获得成功的生动表现。中国共产党大公无私地献身于劳动人民的伟大解放事业，已使中国劳动人民摆脱百余年来中外压迫者的羁绊。”该文指出，美国统治者虽然给了蒋介石六十万万美元以上的援助，并且在实际上替他指挥军队、训练特务，但是国民党反动派仍然遭受了彻底失败。该文指出：“中国民主势力的胜利，不仅表示国民党反动派的失败，而且也表示华尔街帝国主义计划的破产。”
