　　Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 5th—The Northeast Administrative Committee has recently decided that, in addition to the seven state-owned enterprises (military industry, military supplies, hydropower, coal mines, railways, textiles, and post and telecommunications) that have already implemented labor insurance, all other state, provincial, and municipal-operated industrial and mining enterprises that have formally started work and resumed production on a permanent and fixed basis will implement labor insurance from July 1st, based on the Northeast Public Enterprise Wartime Provisional Labor Insurance Regulations and Trial Implementation Rules. To this end, the Northeast Federation of Trade Unions has issued a notice, instructing the trade union federations of each province and city to directly lead the labor insurance work of each state-owned factory unit in their respective provinces and cities, and of state-owned factories in the region that have not yet established industrial trade unions. Based on the preliminary experience gained from the implementation of labor insurance in the seven major state-owned enterprises in Northeast China, the Northeast Federation of Trade Unions stipulates that each factory implementing labor insurance should organize a labor insurance committee jointly by the administration and the trade union, with the participation of the trade union director, the labor insurance minister (or labor insurance committee member), the manager (factory director) or the person in charge of personnel affairs, the head of the management department, and the head of health work. Under the chairmanship of the trade union director, they will jointly discuss, decide, and carry out the preparatory work for the implementation of labor insurance.
    Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang – State-owned enterprises in Shenyang are establishing and strengthening employee consumer cooperatives and supply stores to fully supply employees with daily necessities, to ensure the implementation of the new wage payment methods of the Northeast Administrative Committee. The Northeast Postal and Telecommunications Administration has opened supply stores as required. Among the 115 larger factories in the city, 48 factories have successively established cooperatives. These cooperatives have overcome the profit-making viewpoint through meetings and discussions and focus on serving employees.
