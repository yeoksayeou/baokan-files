  　North China People's Government Departments Hold Meeting to Discuss
    [This newspaper dispatch] To lighten the people's burden, practice strict economy, support the national liberation war, and develop production, the North China People's Government recently held a joint meeting of various departments. Vice Chairmen Lan Gongwu and Yang Xiufeng, as well as heads of various departments, attended and participated in a lively discussion on the streamlining of organizations and the issue of thrift.
    The meeting first provided various statistical survey materials from the General Office, explaining the reasons for the large size of government organizations. This was due to the failure to thoroughly reorganize many Kuomintang bureaucratic organizations taken over; the large number of general administrative staff and support personnel in some technical departments and institutions, while the number of actual technical personnel and working staff was relatively small, in some cases reaching a ratio of one to one; and the total number of faculty, staff, and support personnel in individual schools was equal to or even greater than the number of students. These were all reasons for the large size of the organizations. Secondly, since the government moved to Ping, it had not been able to adapt its institutional life and organizational structure to the needs of the city, which was also one of the reasons for the large size of the organizations.
    The meeting went on to point out that although the entire territory of North China has been liberated, the arduous tasks of supporting the front lines and restoring various constructions are before us, and the vast rural areas have suffered from insufficient winter snow and recent drought, and a poor summer wheat harvest in various places is a foregone conclusion. The issue of organizational size and the issue of living standards should be appropriately adjusted, opposing extravagance and waste, promoting the fine tradition of hard struggle, and all employment and administration should proceed from the needs of work and based on the possibilities of finance. The meeting called on everyone to continue to study and change the past ways of organizational life and work that were suitable for rural conditions to adapt to the conditions of the city, and to launch a campaign of thrift. There must be a new set of methods and new systems. The meeting also emphasized that the system must be unified and strictly implemented to improve the system to help the streamlining of work. For situations where several different treatments exist in the same organization, appropriate adjustments can be studied.
    The responsible comrades of the financial and economic departments then pointed out that there are some phenomena of waste and loss in the various organizations in Pingjin, and proposed that the received materials of the various organizations should be cleaned up, and all public houses, vehicles, and furniture should be uniformly allocated and a system should be established to solve the current phenomenon of unreasonable distribution. The heads of various departments agreed with this opinion. The meeting also believed that some organizations that have completed their tasks should be closed down quickly, and departments with the same work nature and tasks should consider merging; those that can be handed over to local leadership should be handed over to the local areas; and some organizations that can be corporatized should be corporatized step by step according to the specific situation. Those that have already been corporatized should pay special attention to accurate calculation and saving manpower and material resources to achieve self-sufficiency in production and accumulate capital to expand production.
    The meeting emphasized that for the surplus personnel, regardless of whether they are new or old cadres, they must be transferred to other organizations and work in various places, or organized to participate in production undertakings or given training, with a responsible attitude. Secondly, the result of the streamlining of organizations must also be to ensure the improvement of work efficiency. Therefore, streamlining is not an unprincipled reduction. For example, the leading organs of some departments still need to increase some necessary personnel such as policy research, planning work, and statistical investigation, and necessary institutions, to strengthen the leadership of various departments over their businesses.
    The meeting lasted six hours and then came to an end. The various departments of the North China People's Government are continuing to specifically study the plan for streamlining organizations and carrying out thrift, and are putting it into practice.

　　发展生产支援解放战争
  　机关整编开展节约
  　华北人民政府各部门开会讨论
    【本报讯】为了减轻人民负担，厉行节约，以支援全国解放战争，发展生产，华北人民政府于日前召开各部门联席会议，副主席蓝公武、杨秀峰及各部门负责人均出席参加，热烈讨论了机关整编和节约的问题。
    会议首由秘书厅提供各种统计调查材料，说明政府机关编制庞大的原因，是由于接收许多国民党官僚化的机关未加彻底整顿，若干技术部门及事业机关的一一般行政事务人员及勤杂人员的数量大，而真正技术人员及实际工作人员数量相对小，个别有达一与一之比的，个别学校教职员及勤杂人员的总数也有等于甚至多于学生数的现象。这均是使得编制庞大的原因。其次，由于政府移平后，关于机关生活制度和组织机构，尚未能适应城市需要加以调整，这也是使编制庞大的原因之一。
    会议继指出：华北区全境虽已解放，但支援前线与恢复各种建设的艰巨任务，放在我们面前，而广大农村因冬雪不足，近又天旱，各地夏麦歉收，已成定局，机关编制问题，生活制度问题，均应适当调整，反对铺张浪费，提倡节约，发扬固有的艰苦奋斗的优良作风，一切用人行政应从工作需要并根据财政的可能出发。会议要求大家继续研究改变过去适合农村条件的机关生活方式和工作方式，以适应城市的条件，开展节约，必须要有一套新的方法和新的制度。会议又强调制度必须统一与严格贯彻执行，以改善制度帮助整编工作的进行，对于在同一机关中存在几种不同待遇的情况，可研究适当调整。
    财经部门负责同志继指出目前平津各机关存在一些浪费损失现象，并提出应该清理各机关的接收物资，所有公家房屋、车辆、家具，应加以统一调剂，定出制度，解决目前存在分配不合理的现象。各部门负责人均同意这意见。会议并认为有些已经完成任务的机关即应迅速结束，工作性质及任务相同的部门则应考虑合并；能交给地方领导的则交给地方；有些可以实行企业化的机关，应根据具体情况有步骤的实行企业化，已经企业化的机关尤要注意精密计算节省人力物力，以求生产自给并积累资本扩大生产。
    会议着重指出：对于编余人员，不分新老干部，均须以负责的态度，调派到其他机关及各地工作，或组织其参加生产事业或加以训练。其次，机关实行整编的结果，必须同时是保证工作效率的提高，为此整编不是无原则的缩减，例如，各部门领导机关有的尚须增加一些政策研究，计划工作及统计调查等类必要人员，和必要的机构，以加强各部门对业务的领导。
    会议前后历时六小时始告结束，现华北人民政府各部门，正继续具体研究机关整编及开展节约的计划，付予实现。
