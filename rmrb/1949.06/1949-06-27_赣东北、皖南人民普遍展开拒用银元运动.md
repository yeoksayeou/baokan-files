Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, 26th. The movement to reject silver dollars by the people of Beijing, Shanghai and other places has rapidly spread to the vast cities and towns of northeastern Jiangxi and southern Anhui. On the 19th, a symposium of people from all walks of life in Shangrao City unanimously expressed their support for the people's government's call to ban silver dollars. Employees of the Telecommunications Bureau proposed a guarantee: If it is discovered that someone is using telegrams to communicate information for silver dollar speculation, we will immediately report them to the government. On the 20th, propaganda teams from various agencies, troops, factories, and schools were active on the streets, and a rally and parade of more than 10,000 people was held that day. This movement has also been widely launched in towns such as Guixi, Poyang, Yingtan Town, and Jingdezhen in northeastern Jiangxi. In the southern Anhui region, after the Southern Anhui Administrative Office issued a proclamation banning silver dollars on the 16th, the Southern Anhui Trading Company sold necessities such as food, white flour, and cloth at parity prices, and local prices immediately stabilized. On the 19th, Tunxi rice fell by 25%, and Longtou fine cloth fell by 35%.
