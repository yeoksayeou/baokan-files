  　Chapter Eight: The Great Sweep (Continued)
    Four
    Xiao Mei met Xiu Nü'er in the field. When they met, they were both sad and happy, so they ran together. When they were hungry, they asked people for some buns to eat. Having a companion was better, but they encountered the enemy again, and the two of them scattered again.
    Xiao Mei met an old woman digging vegetables in the field. She spoke kindly to the old woman, begging, "Auntie! Look at me, my family is scattered, I have nowhere to stay. Please take me in and recognize me as your daughter, and take me with you!" The old woman saw that she was very pitiful and took Xiao Mei home.
    After staying for two days, the old woman questioned Xiao Mei and found out that she was a cadre. She became frightened and told her to leave. Xiao Mei saw that it was getting dark and raining, so she pleaded, "Mother! Look, it's pitch black, and I have nowhere to go. It's raining so hard, where can I go?" The old woman looked at her, trembling with fear, and said, "Good comrade, you... you should leave quickly! Old Heng next door hid an Eighth Route Army soldier, and the other morning, the whole Old Heng family was killed. Old... Old Heng's wife's breasts were cut off, and her intestines were all over the ground... You... If you don't leave, I can't bear this disaster!" Xiao Mei asked to stay one more night and leave at dawn. The old woman was terrified, her eyes staring straight ahead, and she pushed her, saying, "Good girl, I'm forced by the Japanese devils! You... you can't say I'm heartless..." She pushed Xiao Mei out the door while crying.
    Xiao Mei, drenched in the rain, with tears in her eyes, walked on the dark street. Every household had their doors closed, and she couldn't see a single person, not knowing where to go. Confused, she walked to the entrance of the village and saw a temple. She thought, "Oh! There's no other way, I'll just go to the temple to take shelter from the rain." As soon as she walked in, there was a sudden flash of lightning, bright and shining, and she saw a large clay statue inside with a blue face and fangs, grinning with a big mouth, two round eyes staring at her fiercely, holding a large steel whip in its hand, as if it was about to strike. Xiao Mei was so frightened that her hair stood on end, and she hurried out.
    Xiao Mei was full of grievances and sat on the temple platform crying. Thinking that everywhere was the enemy. A group of comrades died or scattered, Da Shui, Shuang Xi, Hei Lao Cai... all were of unknown fate. How could the War of Resistance be won? She was left alone, pushed out by the old woman in the middle of the night. If the enemy caught her, no one would be able to prove how she sacrificed her life. The superiors told her to persevere, but how could she?
    She thought of her mother, who had passed away two years after she returned home, and she didn't even see her one last time. She also thought of Xiao Shou, that poor child who was snatched away by Zhang Jinlong and tortured to death. Thinking of this, she felt hate, anger, and sadness. The rain was falling softly, as if many people were crying. Xiao Mei was so grieved that her heart was breaking. She looked up and saw a well pulley across from the temple, thinking that there must be a well there, so she might as well die! She walked over to it with tears in her eyes. Climbing onto the pulley, looking into the well, lightning struck several times in a row. Her heart was beating very fast, she gritted her teeth, and was about to jump down.
    But then she thought, she was a Communist Party member, she had sworn an oath in front of Chairman Mao's portrait. This time, the superiors told her not to waver or be pessimistic. If she died for nothing like this, what would that be! She often heard Hei Lao Cai tell stories of the Red Army crossing the snowy mountains and grasslands, how they persevered even in such hardship. The other day, Lao Cai and the others were surrounded and attacked by hundreds of Japanese devils, and he was wounded, but he still fought desperately. It would be so shameful to just kill herself, and it would be a worthless death! Thinking it over, she couldn't die like this. She wandered foolishly by the well for a long time, the rain soaking her whole body, and the wind blowing, she couldn't help but shiver. She returned to the temple platform, sat down in the corner of the wall, and fell asleep, exhausted.
    Five
    At dawn, the rain stopped. Xiao Mei woke up from the cold outside the gate of the Plague God Temple, her wet clothes still sticking to her body, icy cold. Afraid of enemies, she quickly left the village. At the door of a small house in a garden plot, she unexpectedly met Xiu Nü'er again. Looking closer, Tian Ying and Sister Chen were also inside. This was like seeing her own relatives! They hugged each other, overjoyed to the point of tears.
    Xiao Mei said distressedly, "Look! You've all changed!" They said, "You're the same!" Sister Chen was very ill. The day before, she jumped over a wall to escape from the enemy and broke her leg. Tian Ying had constant back pain, her period hadn't come, and she always had leucorrhea, so she couldn't straighten her back. Tian Ying saw that Xiao Mei's blue jacket was soaking wet and quickly told her to take it off and wring it out for her. Da Jie took off her inner pants and gave them to Xiao Mei to change into.
    Xiu Nü'er said, "Ah! What a pity about my bundle, it would be so much better if it was here!" She pulled Xiao Mei and told her, "That day I ran into the enemy, and the bundle was lost in the ditch. I ran for two days and two nights, and somehow I went back there confused. The bundle was still there, so happy, right? I picked up the bundle and ran again, but then I lost it again!" Everyone laughed.
    Da Jie said, "Keep your voices down. It's getting light, we can't stay here, we have to run!" The four of them left the small house. Da Jie's leg was limping, and Xiao Mei and Xiu Nü'er helped her. Tian Ying put her hands on her waist, walking with a bent back, saying, "Really! My back! I can't straighten it no matter how hard I try! There were so many people squeezing that day, I couldn't even straighten up. Ah! Really! Really!" Xiu Nü'er mischievously imitated her accent, saying, "Reawwy! Reawwy! Ah! Couldn't even stwaighten up!" Making them laugh, but not daring to laugh out loud.
    Unexpectedly, the farmland was muddy, and Da Jie slipped, and the three who were helping her all fell, getting a lot of mud on their bodies, their hands becoming mud claws. Xiu Nü'er also got a clump of mud on her nose, and everyone laughed again. Tian Ying pointed at Xiu Nü'er and said, "Good for you! Good for you! Learn from others, rotten mouth, follow others, become a yellow dog!" Xiu Nü'er said, "Don't talk about me! Look at my stance!" She carried Da Jie on her back, Xiao Mei quickly lifted Da Jie's feet, and the three of them ran, swaying. Da Jie said, "Ha! I'm like Li Tieguai riding the clouds!" Afraid of being discovered by the enemy, they all burrowed into the wheat field.
    For several days, they wandered in the wilderness, not daring to enter the village. Alas, what was there to eat? What was there to drink? When they met villagers, they asked for half a cornbread, and the four of them shared it, pushing it back and forth. If they didn't meet anyone, they filled their stomachs with fennel, scallions, wild garlic, and other miscellaneous things. They were so hungry that their eyes went black, and their intestines were twisted into ropes. Everyone was in thin clothes, sleeping on the ground, under the sky. After sleeping in the "ditch" for a few days, and with no food in their stomachs, Sister Chen's illness became more serious. That night, Sister Chen was burning hot all over. The three of them were so anxious, hugging her, holding her, unable to think of a way. Xiao Mei said, "This won't do! Even a healthy person can't stand it, let alone a sick person. We have to stay in the village, at least we can drink some hot water." Da Jie gritted her teeth and said, "Don't do that! I'm afraid I won't get better from this illness! I can't run, I can't be jostled, I don't want to keep burdening you! If we go to the village, who will keep us? You should leave me and go yourselves!" The three of them said, "Sister, don't say that, we'll die together!" They supported her and walked slowly.
    Near a village, Xiao Mei and Xiu Nü'er first went to scout around, and came back saying that the enemy had left at dusk. They had already spoken to a villager, who said they could rest there. So they supported Da Jie and walked to the edge of the village, entering a sorghum stalk woven gate. A woman in her forties leaned half her body out of the door, looked around, and turned back to them, whispering, "Quietly, come into the house quickly!"
    The woman casually closed the door, and told her daughter to listen at the door. She quickly led them to the inner room, settled the patient to sleep on the kang, covered her with a quilt, blew out the lamp, and said in a low voice, "We are all one family! I am also a family member of a soldier. It's okay for you to stay here. If the Japanese devils come, just hide in the wilderness." Xiao Mei said, "Auntie, this comrade is very ill! Could you boil some water for her to drink?" The woman said, "Yes, yes, yes!" and went out.
    The four of them felt pain all over, lying on the kang, feeling extremely comfortable. They all fell asleep immediately. Drowsily, someone pushed them. Opening their eyes, they saw that the room was lit, and a tattered cotton-padded coat was covering the small window. The woman stood by the kang, whispering, "Comrades, eat quickly. I've been hiding this for many days, afraid that the Japanese devils would find it. I'll feel relieved after you eat it!"
    They saw four steaming bowls of soup placed on the edge of the kang. The woman handed them chopsticks. They picked up the bowls, unexpectedly the bowls were filled with finely ground white noodles. The fragrant smell of fried scallions went straight to their noses. Ah! What had they been eating all these days? They smiled! Smiled! Smiling, tears fell into the bowls. Xiu Nü'er cried, "Mother! It would have been enough if you had given us two buns! You made white noodles... white noodle soup..." The four of them cried even harder. The woman comforted them, tears also falling down.
    Six
    After eating, they discussed with the woman and secretly dug a hole in the wheat field, like digging an old rat's nest, small at the entrance and large inside. The soil they dug out was transported far away. Except for Chen Da Jie who was sick, the three of them, along with the woman and her little daughter, worked together, only finishing it after toiling all night. The woman also brought dry firewood from home and spread it in the hole. The four of them stayed in the hole day and night. The woman and her daughter pretended to pick shepherd's purse, sending them food twice a day, and also reported the situation: the Japanese devils and traitors were surrounding the village, arresting young people, robbing things, searching for the Eighth Route Army, looking for village cadres... They came five times one day. The puppet regime was established in the village. Larger villages nearby were building blockhouses, some of which had already been built.
    Xiao Mei and the others stayed in the hole, not daring to come out for several days. The hole was wet and dark, and all four of them grew boils and scabies all over their bodies, which were itchy and painful, very uncomfortable! There were so many fleas in the firewood pile, biting them unbearably. They couldn't straighten their legs, and their heads were always hunched over. Xiao Mei said with a smile, "Have you ever seen chicken being sold? We've all become chickens with bent necks!"
    Xiu Nü'er couldn't help but say, "I'm suffocating staying in here like this! I really want to go out and run around!" Tian Ying said, "Be honest, don't cause trouble!" Chen Da Jie said worriedly, "We don't know where our people are, how can we get in touch with them?" Xiao Mei suggested, "This hole is small, it would be more spacious with just two people inside. Xiu Nü'er and I will go out to find connections, and leave Tian Ying to take care of Da Jie. After we find someone, we'll come back to pick you up, okay?" Everyone agreed.
    That night, Xiao Mei and Xiu Nü'er crawled out of the hole. The woman gave them a broken basket, which contained buns and boiled yams. Xiao Mei and Xiu Nü'er headed towards Huanghua Village.
    After being cooped up for so many days, it was so wonderful to be in the wilderness. Xiu Nü'er kept breathing deeply, saying that she smelled the fragrance of morning glory. Xiao Mei said that it wasn't the fragrance of flowers, but the fragrance of wheat, and said, "The green gauze curtain is up, and it's easier for us to move around!"
    After walking for a while, they came to a village and hid in the darkness to listen, but there was no movement. The two of them discussed going in to scout around and find out where the organization was. They entered the village, went around two small alleys, but couldn't find a single person. The people had all closed their doors. Unable to figure out the situation, they didn't dare to knock on doors. Just as they were hesitating, they suddenly heard a phonograph playing foreign opera, and people were talking gibberish. Xiao Mei pulled Xiu Nü'er and said in a low voice, "Bad! We've run under their noses!" Xiu Nü'er didn't believe it, hiding at the entrance of the alley, and poking her head out to look at the street. Sure enough, a large blockhouse stood at the east end of the street, shining brightly with lights. Xiu Nü'er quickly turned around and said, "How unlucky! Let's run!"
    Just as they were running, a small door creaked open, and a man came out. Seeing them looking flustered, he told them to stop and asked, "What are you doing?" Xiu Nü'er quickly said, "We're begging for food." The man said suspiciously, "Why are you begging for food in the middle of the night? You must not be good people!" Xiao Mei suddenly saw that he was carrying a pistol in his hand, and her heart tightened. The man said, "Come with me!" and took them into the house.
    As soon as they entered the house, the man tried to take the broken basket that Xiu Nü'er was carrying and checked it under the oil lamp. There was nothing in the basket, only two boiled yams and a few corn buns. He shook his head and said, "Something's not right! You're lying. If you're begging for food, you must have gotten a little from this house and a little from that house. How come the buns in this basket are all the same color and the same size? They were obviously made in one pot. You can't lie!" Xiao Mei and Xiu Nü'er were speechless. Xiao Mei had no choice but to say, "We weren't originally begging for food, we're visiting relatives. We got lost in the dark and took the wrong road!" She pointed to Xiu Nü'er and said, "This is my cousin. She's young and doesn't know any better. Don't take her words to heart!"
    The man was wearing plain clothes, and looked to be in his twenties. He looked at Xiao Mei, then at Xiu Nü'er, scrutinizing them back and forth, making them lower their heads and feel uneasy. The man suddenly stood up and said, "You two must be cadres. Tell me, which district do you work in?"
    Xiu Nü'er firmly said, "We're not even close to being cadres, we're just ordinary people!" The man stared at them and suddenly asked, "Do you know Cheng Ping or Hei Lao Cai?" Their hearts raced even faster. They shook their heads together and said, "We don't know them!" The man said again, "If you don't tell the truth, I'll send you to the blockhouse!" Their faces changed drastically, and the young man started laughing.
    He said, "Don't be afraid, we're all on the same side. The county brigade is stationed here. I'll call someone to come and talk to you face to face." Saying that, he walked to the opposite room, and they could hear someone opening the door and walking out. Xiao Mei and Xiu Nü'er quietly discussed, "How could the county brigade be stationed under the blockhouse? He must be deliberately tricking us! Let's make up a story and never admit anything, even if we die!" So they sat on the edge of the kang and started discussing.
    Just as they finished making up the story, the man came, followed by a person, dark-skinned, smiling, with bristly sideburns, who was none other than Hei Lao Cai! Xiao Mei and Xiu Nü'er were overjoyed, jumping off the kang and saying, "Ha! So it was you all along!" Xiu Nü'er grabbed Hei Lao Cai's big hand and said, "You scared us to death!" Lao Cai's neck wound hadn't healed yet. He tilted his head and smiled, saying, "Why did you two come here pretending to be beggars? Our village cadres thought you were traitors!" Xiu Nü'er pointed at the village cadre and laughed, saying, "We thought he was a traitor!"
    Xiao Mei asked Lao Cai, "How are you so bold, living right under the blockhouse?" Lao Cai smiled and said, "We slowly figured it out. The more places like this, the less attention the enemy pays. As long as we control the cadres and masses below, there's no problem." He smiled triumphantly, "Hey! Don't say that central Hebei doesn't have mountains, human mountains are more secure than stone mountains!"
    After chatting for a while, Lao Cai led them to another villager's house to wash their faces and eat. Xiao Mei and Xiu Nü'er felt like they had been wandering away from home for many years, and were now seeing their relatives. They had so many things to say that they couldn't finish. Truly, after finding the organization, there were solutions, their confidence was high, and their spirits were good. The two of them just kept laughing.
    Lao Cai told them news of many comrades, and also said that there was still no news of Niu Da Shui after he was captured by the enemy. He sent someone to pick up Chen Da Jie, and arranged for the two of them to rest.
    After resting for two days, Lao Cai said to them, "Don't run around anymore. There is a lot of work to be done. I've already assigned it to the district. You should quickly go to Xiyu Village to find Shuang Xi and the others!" He sent a village cadre to escort them away.

　　新儿女英雄传
  　第八回　大扫荡（续）
    四
    小梅在地里碰见秀女儿了。两个人见了面，又是难受又是喜欢，就在一块儿跑。饿了就向人要口饽饽吃。有个伴儿还好一点；可是又遭遇了敌人，两个人又跑散了。
    小梅碰见一个老婆儿在地里剜菜呢。她就跟老婆儿说好话，央告说：“大娘啊！你看我一家子跑散了，没个地方存身，你修修好，认我个闺女，带着我吧！”老婆儿看她怪可怜，就把小梅带回家了。
    留了两天，老婆儿盘问出小梅是个干部，害了怕，就叫她走。小梅眼看着天黑了，又下着雨，就哀求说：“干娘啊！你看黑洞洞的，我又没个投奔处，下着这么大的雨，叫我往哪儿走啊？”老婆儿看着她就害怕得发抖，说：“好同志哩，你你快走吧！隔壁老恒家藏了个八路，前儿个早上连老恒家一齐砍了。老……老恒家奶子都割喽，肠子流了一地……你……你不走，我可背不起这个祸啊！”小梅要求再留一宿，天明就走。老婆儿怕得不行，直着眼睛，推她说：“好闺女，我也是给鬼子逼得没办法！你……你可别说我狠心……”她一面流眼泪，一面把小梅推出大门。
    小梅淋着雨，眼里转着泪花儿，在黑糊糊的街上走。家家户户都插上门了，也看不见一个人，不知道往哪儿去好。稀里糊涂走到村口，看见一个庙，心里想：“唉！没办法，就到庙里避避雨吧。”刚走进去，忽然打了个闪，亮烁烁的，看见里边青面獠牙的一个大泥像，咧着大嘴，两只圆圆的眼睛，对她凶狠狠的瞪着，手里举个大钢鞭，就象要打下来似的。吓得小梅头发根儿都立起了，赶忙退出来。
    小梅一肚子委屈，坐在庙台上哭。想想哪儿也是敌人。一伙子同志死的死，散的散，大水双喜黑老蔡……也都不知道死活，抗战可怎么能胜利啊？剩下自己一个儿，黑间半夜给老人家推出来了，要是敌人抓去，死了也没有人证明是怎么牺牲的，上级叫坚持，可怎么坚持呀？
    她想起老娘，回家两年就亡故了，临死也没有见一面。又想起小瘦，这可怜的孩子给张金龙抢了去，活活儿糟害死了。想到这儿，又是恨，又是气，又是伤心。那雨淅淅唰唰的下着，好象许多人在哭。小梅恸得肠子都要断了；一抬头，看见庙对面有个辘轳，心想那儿准有个井，倒不如死了吧！就流着眼泪走过去。爬在辘轳上，望着井里，闪电一连打了几下，她心跳得很厉害，咬咬牙，就想跳下去。
    可是她转念又想，自己是个共产党员，在毛主席像的面前宣过誓的，这回上级还叫咱不要动摇悲观；这么白白的死了，算个什么！常听黑老蔡讲红军过雪山草地的故事，人家那么苦还坚持；那天老蔡他们给几百鬼子围着打，他挂了彩，也还拼命抵抗呢；咱好好儿自己寻死，多丢人啊，死也死得没价值！想来想去，不能这么死了。她痴痴呆呆的在井边爬了半天，雨把她浑身淋得湿透了，风吹着，忍不住打寒战；她回到庙台上，在墙角里坐下来，累得迷迷糊糊的，睡着了。
    五
    傍明，雨停了。小梅在瘟神庙门外冻醒过来，湿漉漉的衣裳还贴在身上，凉冰冰的。又怕有敌人，赶快离开村子。在一个园子地的小屋门口，想不到又碰见秀女儿了；再一瞧，田英和陈大姐也在里面。这可见了亲人啦！你抱抱我，我抱抱你，快活得眼泪都流下来了。
    小梅心疼的说：“瞧！你们模样儿都变啦！”她们说：“你还不是一样！”陈大姐病得很厉害，前天敌人追她，她跳墙逃跑，又把腿摔坏了。田英尽腰痛，不来月经，老是白带，腰都直不起。田英看小梅身上一件蓝褂儿湿透了，忙叫她脱下来给她拧。大姊脱下里面的一条裤子给小梅换上。
    秀女儿说：“嗳！可惜我的包袱，要在跟前多好啊！”她拉着小梅告诉：“那天碰上敌人，包袱在洼里丢了，跑了两天两夜，不知道怎么糊里糊涂的又转回去了，包袱还撂在那儿呢，可欢喜吧，抱上包袱又跑，跑跑可又跑丢啦！”大家都笑了。
    大姐说：“你们小声些。天明了，这儿待不住，咱们还得跑！”四个人出了小屋。大姐的腿拐着，小梅和秀女儿扶着她。田英两支手叉在腰里，弯着腰走，一边说：“真是！我这个腰！使劲也直不起来！那天那么多人挤，挤也挤不直。嗳！真是！真是！”秀女儿调皮的学她口音说：“真四！真四！嗳！挤也挤不子！”逗得她们直笑，又不敢笑出声来。
    不提防庄稼地泥糊糊的，大姐一滑，连扶她的，三个都跌倒了，身上弄了好些泥，手都成了泥爪子；秀女儿的鼻子上也碰了一垛泥，大家又是个笑。田英指着秀女儿说：“你好！你好！跟人学，烂咀角，跟人走，变黄狗！”秀女儿说：“你别说啦！瞧我的架势！”她背起大姐，小梅忙抬起大姐的脚，三个人晃晃荡荡的跑。大姐说：“哈呀！我这李铁拐驾起云来啦！”她们怕敌人发觉，都钻进麦地里去了。
    一连几天，他们在野地里转，不敢进村去。吓，什么是那吃的呀！什么是那喝的呀！碰着老乡，要上一半个窝窝头，四个人你推我让的分着吃。碰不上，什么茴香、小葱、野蒜，胡乱八七的填肚子。直饿得她们两眼发黑，肠子都拧成绳子啦。大家单衣薄裳的，铺着地，盖着天，睡了几天“洼”，肚里又没食儿，陈大姐的病越发重了。　这天晚上，陈大姐浑身烧得滚烫。急得她们三个，搂着她，抱着她，想不出个办法。小梅说：“这么着不行啊！好人都顶不住，病人更吃不住劲儿，咱们得宿到村里去；能喝口热水，也沾点儿光。”大姐咬着牙说：“别那么着！我这个病怕好不了啦！跑又不能跑，颠又不能颠，老累着你们可不行啊！要是到村里去，谁留咱们这一伙呢？你们还是扔了我，走你们吧！”那三个说：“大姐，别那么说，咱们要死也死在一块儿！”她们架着她，慢慢儿走。
    到一个村子附近，小梅和秀女儿先去探了探，回来说，敌人傍黑走了，已经跟一家老乡说好，可以去歇歇。就架着大姐，走到村边，进了一个秫秸编的柴门儿。一个四十多岁的大婶子，探出半个身子到门外，四面望了望，回头对她们小声说：“你们悄悄儿，快到屋里去！”
    大婶子随手把门带上，叫她的女孩子在门边听着点。她急忙引她们到里间屋，安顿病人睡在炕上，用被子盖好，吹灭了灯，低声说：“咱们都是一家人！我也是抗属，你们在这儿待着不碍，鬼子来，就钻野地。”小梅说：“大婶子，我们这个同志病得厉害啦！你给他烧口水喝吧。”大婶子说：“行行行！”就出去了。
    她们四个觉得浑身都痛，躺在炕上，说不出多舒服。一下子都睡着了。朦朦胧胧的有人推她们，睁开眼儿一瞧，屋里点着灯，小窗户上蒙着一件破棉袄。大婶子站在炕边，小声说：“同志，你们快吃吧。这点儿东西，我藏了好些天，就怕鬼子翻出来。给你们吃了，我心里就痛快啦！”
    她们看见，炕沿上放着热腾腾的四碗汤，大婶子拿筷子分给她们。她们端起碗儿来，想不到碗里是赶得细溜溜的白面条。一股香喷喷的油炸葱花的味儿，直钻鼻子。哈呀！这些天，她们尽吃的什么呀？她们笑了！笑了！笑着笑着，眼泪扑沙沙的掉在碗里了。秀女儿哭着说：“干娘啊！你打发我们两个饽饽就行啦！你给作的白面……白面汤……”四个人哭得更痛了。大婶子忙安慰她们，眼泪也掉下来了。
    六
    吃罢饭，她们跟大婶子合计，偷偷儿在麦子地里，跟打老鼠仓似的，挖了一个洞，口儿小，里面大，挖出来的土都运到远处。除了陈大姐病着，她三个连大婶子和她的小闺女一齐动手，直鼓捣一夜才挖成。大婶子又从家里抱来了干柴禾，铺在洞里。她们四个白天黑夜都在洞里钻着。大婶子母女俩假装挑苴菜，一天给她们送两次饭，还报告情况：鬼子汉奸尽包围村，抓青年、抢东西、搜查八路，找村干部……有一天就来了五回。村里伪政权建立起来了。附近较大的村子，都在修岗楼，有的已经修起了。
    小梅她们在洞里待着，一连好几天不敢出来。洞里又湿、又黑，四个人谁都长了一身脓疙瘩疥，又痒，又痛，怪难受！柴禾堆里多少跳蚤啊，咬得不行。她们腿也伸不直，头都窝着，小梅笑着说：“你们见过卖烧鸡的吗？咱们都成了窝脖子鸡啦！”
    秀女儿忍不住说：“老这么钻着，可把我蹩死啦！我真想出去跑跑哟！”田英说：“你老实点吧，别找事儿啦！”陈大姐发愁说：“咱们的人可不知都在哪儿，怎么能跟他们取上联系才好呢。”小梅就提议：“这个洞小，两个人待在里面就宽敞了。我和秀女儿出去找关系，留田英招护大姐，我们找着人，再来接你们，好不好？”大家都同意了。
    这天晚上，小梅秀女儿从洞里爬出来，大婶子送给她们一个破篮儿，里面是饽饽和煮山药，小梅秀女儿就奔黄花村的方向去了。
    蹩了好些天，一走到野地里，这舒服劲儿可真不能提啦。秀女儿不住的使大劲吸气，说是有小喇叭花的香味儿。小梅说，不是花香，是麦子香呢；又说：“青纱帐起来了，咱们又好活动啦！”
    她俩走了一阵，来到一个村子，躲在黑暗里听一听，没什么动静。两个就商量，想进去探一探，打听机关在哪儿。她俩进了村，绕了两个小胡同，可一个人也碰不见。老百姓都插上门了。摸不清情况，也不敢叫门。正迟疑呢，忽然听见戏匣子唱开了洋戏，还有人嘀哩嘟噜的说话。小梅拉着秀女儿低声说：“坏了！咱们跑到人家眼皮子底下啦！”秀女儿还不信，隐在胡同口里，探出头儿向街上一望，街东头果然矗起一个大岗楼，亮亮的射着灯光。秀女儿忙转身说：“真晦气！快跑吧！”
    刚跑，一个小门咿呀的开了，走出一个男人来，看她俩挺惊慌，就叫她们站住，问：“你们是干什么的？”秀女儿忙说：“要饭的。”那人怀疑的说：“怎么你们黑间半夜还要饭呢？准不是好人！”小梅一下子瞧见他手里提着个手枪，心就抽紧了。那人说：“你们跟我来！”就把她俩带进屋里去。
    一进屋里，那男人就把秀女儿挎的破篮子要去，凑在油灯底下检查。篮里可没什么，只有两块煮山药，几个玉米饽饽。他摇着脑袋说：“不对头！你们撒谎呢。你们既是要饭的，一定这家要一点儿，那家要一点儿，怎么这篮里的饽饽是一个颜色，一样大小呢？明明是一锅出来的么。你们不说实话可不行！”小梅秀女儿给他说得无言答对，小梅只好说：“我们原本不是要饭的，是串亲戚的，黑夜失迷道儿，走岔路啦！”又指着秀女儿说：“这是我表妹，她年轻，不懂事儿，说多了话，你可别多心！”
    那人穿一身便衣，年纪也就是二十多岁，两只眼睛瞅瞅小梅，瞅瞅秀女儿，来回的打量，瞅得她俩搭拉着脑袋，心里直发毛。那人忽然站起来说：“你们俩准是干部。你们说说，在哪区工作的？”
    秀女儿坚决的说：“我们连干部的边儿也挨不着，我们就是老百姓！”那人盯着她们，突然问：“你们认得程平黑老蔡不？”她俩心更慌了，一齐摇头说：“我们不认得！”那人又说：“你们不说实话，送你们到岗楼上去！”她俩唰的变了脸儿，年轻人可笑起来了。
    他说：“你们别害怕，咱们都是自己人，县大队在这儿住着呢，我叫个人来跟你们对对面。”说着，他走到对面屋里去了，听得见有人开大门走出去。小梅和秀女儿悄悄商量说：“县大队还能扎在岗楼底下呀？准是故意诈我们的！咱们把口供编好，死也别承认！”她俩就坐在炕沿上咭咕开了。
    刚把口供串好，那男人来了，后面跟着一个人，黑不溜，笑迷迷，连鬓胡子毛楂楂的，可正是黑老蔡小梅和秀女儿乐坏了，忙跳下炕，说：“哈！闹了半天原来是你哟！”秀女儿拉着黑老蔡的大手说：“可把我们俩吓坏了！”老蔡脖子上的伤还没好；他歪着头儿笑着说：“怎么你俩到这儿来装要饭的？咱们的村干部还以为你们是汉奸呢！”秀女儿指着那村干部笑了起来，说：“我们才以为他是汉奸呢！”
    小梅问老蔡：“怎么你们这么大胆儿，偏偏凑在岗楼底下住呢？”老蔡笑着说：“我们慢慢摸出门儿了，越是这样的地方，敌人越不注意；只要咱们掌握住下面的干部和群众，什么问题也没有。”他得意的笑着：“嗨！别说冀中没有山，人山比石山还保险！”
    说了一阵闲话，老蔡就引她们到另一个老乡家里，洗脸、吃饭。小梅秀女儿就象出门流落了好些年，回家见了自己的亲人，许多话儿说也说不完。真是，找到了组织，办法也有了，信心也高了，情绪也好了，两个人嘻嘻嘻的只是笑。
    老蔡给她们说了许多同志的消息；又说到牛大水给敌人抓去以后，还没有信儿。他一面打发人接陈大姐，一面安顿她俩休息。
    休息了两天，老蔡就对她俩说：“以后再别乱跑了。现在有许多工作要作，已经给区上布置下去，你们赶快到西渔村找双喜他们去吧！”就叫一个村干送她俩走了。　　　　　　　　　（未完）
