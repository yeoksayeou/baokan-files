　　Xinhua News Agency, North China, 1st: The Hebei-Shandong-Henan region's development of the supply and marketing cooperative undertaking has won farmer support. The district's Supply and Marketing Cooperative General Office, after two months of preparation, was formally established on April 4th. Immediately, cadres were selected to study policies and operations. Based on the different local products, economies, and transportation conditions, nine important market towns were identified as key pilot areas. The establishment of business in each key area has been underway for over twenty days. They provide members with production and daily necessities at low prices and purchase members' surplus products at high prices. Although members' shareholdings do not pay dividends, they greatly reduce the exploitation by merchants, and therefore, they have begun to win farmer support. In the past month's work, it has also been realized that the establishment of supply and marketing cooperatives must combine specific business actions with publicity and mobilization to quickly dispel public concerns and expand membership. The elimination of the cadres' condescending attitudes and the improvement of business capabilities are also urgent tasks. For example, some cadres, not understanding percentages, caused the actual supply price, which was supposed to be 5% lower than the market price, to reach 25% lower than the market price due to market price increases, resulting in significant losses.

　　冀鲁豫供销合作事业
  　开始获得农民拥护
    【新华社华北一日电】冀鲁豫区开展供销合作事业，已获农民拥护。经两个月筹备的该区供销总社于四月四日正式成立，当即抽调干部学习政策与业务，根据物产、经济、交通的不同情况确定九个重要集镇为试办重点。各重点建立业务迄今二十余日，廉价供给社员生产、生活必需品，高价吸收社员剩余生产品，社员入股虽不分红，但大大减除商人中间剥削，因而已开始获得农民拥护。月来开展工作中并体会到供销社的建立，必须以具体的业务行动结合宣传动员，才能更快的解除群众顾虑，扩大社员，而干部恩赐观点的革除以及业务能力的提高，亦为迫切的任务。譬如有些干部因不懂百分比，市场物价上涨，其低于市价百分之五的供给价格实际已达百分之二十五。以致赔损甚大。
