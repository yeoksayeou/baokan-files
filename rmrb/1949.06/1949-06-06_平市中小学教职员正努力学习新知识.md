　　Ping City Middle and Primary School Teachers and Staff are Striving to Learn New Knowledge

　　Since the liberation of Beiping, a tremendous change has gradually taken place among the six thousand middle and primary school teachers and staff. Their own organization—the Middle and Primary School Teachers and Staff Union—was established. Four thousand two hundred and thirty-eight middle and primary school teachers and staff joined this organization. Under its unified leadership, these teachers and staff, who were known for their disorganization and were difficult not to be disorganized in the past, launched unprecedentedly enthusiastic learning.

　　Before liberation, under the long-term rule of the Kuomintang, most middle and primary school teachers and staff were relatively unclear about the future development of the situation and did not understand the CCP's policies. After liberation, they learned from newspapers, meetings, documents, and books about the CCP's policies of uniting and transforming intellectuals, and realized that as long as they worked hard to learn and transform their thinking, they could continue to serve in their positions. However, in the depths of their minds, some people still retained the idea that education is detached from politics, believing that "no matter who is in power, you have to run education, and you can't do without me to ring the bell for class." Before liberation, most of them never asked about school administration except for teaching and working, and this attitude still exists today. There are also some people who consider themselves specialized talents with special skills and can be sold for a good price. On the other hand, the vast majority of middle and primary school teachers and staff have also realized that if they do not make progress themselves, it will be difficult to educate students, so they urgently demand to learn new knowledge and transform their old ideas. Many people spontaneously organized learning, held symposiums on current affairs, invited university professors to give lectures, and studied various policies and documents. Now most middle schools have established political study groups. Under the leadership of the city's Teachers Union, four city-wide study groups closely related to professional work have been established, including Chinese, history, natural science, and political common sense, which are frequently researched and discussed. Schools have also adopted different learning methods, such as small group reading sessions, symposiums, etc., and some have also established life review or criticism meetings. Most teachers now consciously demand learning and progress. However, because middle school teachers generally teach part-time, many teachers teach an average of forty hours per week. Traveling back and forth affects their learning. This is a huge organizational task, and if it is organized well, this problem can be gradually solved.

　　Most of the primary school teachers and staff in Beiping are graduates of normal schools or secondary schools, who became teachers and staff because their families were poor and they could not continue their studies. Their enthusiasm for learning is very high, and they have established many political common sense study groups and music research associations, and also frequently hold various lecture meetings and study discussion meetings. However, they generally lack the habit of self-study. Women account for more than half of the primary school teachers and staff, and their family burdens are very heavy. In addition, there is a lack of experience in learning systems and leadership, so some learning becomes a mere formality.

　　Two months of learning activities have proved that it is very necessary to lead learning in a planned way and establish a small group learning system. Learning should be linked to professional work, and the methods of criticism and self-criticism should be used to improve and consolidate learning enthusiasm and work morale.

　　Generally, middle and primary school teachers and staff are very satisfied with the learning method of large lectures or listening to reports. They believe that this is relatively easy to accept. They said that the casual talk method is also very good, which can make some people who are unwilling to learn gradually become interested in learning.

　　In the past two months, middle and primary school teachers and staff have made considerable progress in their respective professional studies. In terms of political theory learning, they generally learned "On New Democracy," "The Chinese Revolution and the Chinese Communist Party," "Urban Policy," "On the Transformation of Intellectuals," and "A New Outlook on Life." These famous documents instilled a basic viewpoint in everyone: education must serve the people, and intellectuals must integrate with workers and peasants. Therefore, they are also more serious about teaching than before. Some teachers have begun to change the past injection teaching method and teach students with heuristic teaching. At the same time, they have also begun to care about students' activities. In every school, there are some teachers who live very close to the students' lives, and this is the most obvious learning achievement of this period.

　　平市中小学教职员正努力学习新知识
    柏生
    北平解放后，在六千个中小学教职员中逐渐发生了一种巨大的变化。他们自己的组织—中小学教职员联合会产生了。有四千二百三十八个中小学教职员参加了这个组织。在它统一领导下，这些向以散漫著称，而在过去也很难不散漫的教职员们，展开了破天荒的热烈的学习。
    解放以前，在国民党长期统治下，一般中小学教职员对于时局发展前途都比较模糊，对中共政策亦多不了解。解放以后，他们从报纸、会议、文件、书籍中了解了中共对知识分子的团结、改造的政策，认识了只要自己努力学习，改造思想，就可以继续在自己岗位上服务。但是在思想深处，有些人仍然保留着一种教育超然于政治的想法，认为“不管是谁的天下，你都得办教育，要摇铃上课就少不了我”。在解放以前，他们中间的大多数除了教书作事外，一向不问校政，这种态度现在也还存在着。也还有一种人，自命是专门人材，有特殊技能，可以待价而沽。另一方面，绝大多数中小学教职员也已经认识到：如果自己不进步，就很难教育学生，因此迫切要求学习新知识和改造自己的旧思想。许多人自发的组织学习，召开时事问题座谈会、邀请大学教授讲演，学习各种政策和文件。现在大多数中学都成立了政治学习会。在全市教联会的领导下，更成立了全市性的与业务配合的国文、历史、自然科学、政治常识等四个学习会，经常研究讨论。各校还采取了不同的学习方式：如小组读书会、座谈会等，有的还建立了生活检讨或批评会。多数教员现在自觉的要求学习与进步。但因中学教员一般多是兼课，平均每周兼课四十个钟点的教师很多。来回跑路，影响他们的学习。这是一个庞大的组织工作，组织得好，这个问题当可逐步解决。
    北平小学教职员大多是师范毕业或中等学校毕业，因家境困难不能继续上学而当了教职员的。他们学习的热情非常高，成立了许多政治常识学习会和音乐研究会等组织，还经常举行各种讲演会、学习讨论会。但他们一般都缺乏自学的习惯。在小学教职员中女性又占半数以上，她们的家庭负担都很重，加以学习制度和领导方面还缺乏经验，因此有些学习便流于形式。
    两个多月的学习活动，证明了有计划的去领导学习和建立小组的学习制度是十分必要的。应将学习与业务联系起来，用批评与自我批评的方法去提高与巩固学习热情和工作情绪。
    一般中小学教职员对于大讲演或听报告的学习方式很满意。认为这是比较容易接受的。他们说，漫谈的方式也很好，可以使一些不愿意学习的也慢慢对学习发生了兴趣。
    两个多月以来，中小学教职员对各自业务的学习已有了相当的进步。在政治理论学习方面，他们一般的学习了“新民主主义论”、“中国革命与中国共产党”、“城市政策”、“论知识分子的改造”、“新人生观”等。这些著名的文献给大家灌输了一个基本的观点：教育必须为人民服务，知识分子必须与工农结合。因此，他们在教学方面也都比以前认真了。有些教师已开始改变了过去注入的教学法，而以启发式的教学教导学生们。同时对学生的活动也开始关心起来。在各个学校中都有一部分教师与学生生活得很接近，这就是这一个时期最明显的学习成绩。
