Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 2nd: Tokyo dispatch: Thirty-five thousand sulfur workers across Japan began a nationwide strike at midnight on May 30th. Thirty-nine sulfur mines and nine sulfuric acid factories have been brought to a standstill by this strike demanding wage increases.

Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 2nd: Tokyo dispatch: More than 1,500 members of the National Railway Workers' Union, the Printing Workers' Union, the Film and Theater Workers' Union, and students held a demonstration in front of the Tokyo Municipal Assembly on the afternoon of the 29th, protesting the so-called "New Public Security Law" being discussed by the City Council, which interferes with demonstrations and public gatherings. Demonstrators were brutally beaten by armed police, and Hashimoto Kinjiro, a member of the Tokyo Transportation Workers' Union, was tied up by the police, thrown from a window on the fourth floor, and killed. After this tragedy occurred, 3,000 workers in Tokyo demonstrated again in front of the Tokyo City Hall building on the afternoon of the 30th, protesting this fascist atrocity by the police. The Japanese Communist Party and the Labor-Peasant Party both issued statements on the 30th, condemning the police's methods of suppressing demonstrations, demanding a thorough investigation of the matter, and punishing the perpetrators.
