Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 7th: TASS dispatch, 5th: At the initiative of the Swedish Left-wing Women's Federation (a branch of the Women's International Democratic Federation), Swedish women have launched a signature campaign calling for the defense of peace. More than 50,000 women have signed the petition, which was submitted to the United Nations Secretariat on the 3rd. The petition states: "We, the Swedish women who have signed this, urge the United Nations to begin negotiations on the reduction of armaments under international supervision without delay, and to strive to reach an international agreement banning atomic weapons and other mass destructive tools. For the sake of our children, for the sake of our country and humanity, we ask the United Nations to take these measures to defend peace."
    Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 7th: Warsaw dispatch: Women workers of a Warsaw clothing enterprise recently wrote a letter to the mothers of America saying: We, on behalf of all mothers in Poland, call on you to join the struggle against the instigators of new wars and for peace. With us are the fighters for the peace camp, all the women and all the mothers of the people's democratic countries, who, like us, are constantly concerned about the fate of our loved ones. If you also cherish the lives of your husbands, children, and brothers, then fight for peace. We hope that you will tell the American people about the peace policy implemented by the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries, and the desire of millions of Polish women to fight for peace.
