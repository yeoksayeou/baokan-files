　　Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, 3rd: The important commercial port of Qingdao was liberated on the 2nd. The defending enemy fled south by boat. Order within the city is good. Telecommunications links between the city and Beiping and other locations were restored today. With the liberation of Qingdao, all of Shandong Province is liberated. The People's Liberation Army now controls most of the nation's coastline, from Liaoning in the north to Zhejiang in the south.

　　Qingdao is located in Jiaozhou Bay in the eastern part of Shandong Province. The bay is wide and deep, making it a famous good harbor in our country. It was leased to Germany as a military port in the 23rd year of the Guangxu reign. In the 3rd year of the Republic of China, it was occupied by Japan. It was recovered in the 11th year of the Republic of China. After Japan surrendered, the Kuomintang reactionaries handed Qingdao over to the United States as a base for aggression against China and assistance to the Kuomintang reactionaries in carrying out civil war. The US Western Pacific Fleet was permanently stationed here, and several thousand Marines were stationed in the city. At the end of May, due to the great victory of the People's Liberation Army in liberating Shanghai, Qingdao became increasingly isolated, and US naval vessels and personnel began to withdraw from Qingdao.

　　[Report from this city] After the liberation of Qingdao, wireless telephone service between Beiping and Qingdao was successfully tested and found to be clear on the afternoon of the 3rd. The Military Control Commission's Beiping Telecommunications Bureau has decided to open commercial calls from the 4th, from 8:00 to 9:00 and from 13:00 to 14:00 each day. The cost of each call is tentatively set at 400 yuan in People's Currency.

　　我军解放青岛
  　山东省全部已获解放
  　北平青岛电讯畅通商话开放
    【新华社济南三日电】重要商埠青岛已于二日解放，守敌登船南逃。市内秩序良好。该地与北平等地电讯联络已于本日恢复。青岛解放后，山东省全部解放。人民解放军已控制了北起辽宁南达浙江的全国海岸线的大部。
    青岛位于山东省东部胶州湾内，该湾港宽水深，为我国有名的良港。清光绪二十三年租予德国为军港，民国三年为日本所占，民国十一年收回。日本投降后，国民党反动派又将青岛让于美国作为侵略中国和援助国民党反动派进行内战的基地之一，美西太平洋舰队常驻于此，市内曾驻有海军陆战队数千人。五月底，由于人民解放军解放上海的伟大胜利，青岛益形孤立，美海军舰只与人员始撤离青岛。
    【本市讯】青岛解放后，北平和青岛间的无线电话业已于三日下午试叫畅通，声音清晰。军管北平电信局决自四日起，每日八至九时，十三至十四时，开放商话，每次通话费暂订为人民券四百元。
