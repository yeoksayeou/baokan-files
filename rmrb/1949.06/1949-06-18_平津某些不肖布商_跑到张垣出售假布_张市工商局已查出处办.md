　　Unscrupulous Cloth Merchants from Tianjin and Beijing
  　Run to Zhangjiakou to Sell Fake Cloth
  　Zhangjiakou Municipal Administration for Industry and Commerce Has Investigated and Handled the Matter
    [Zhangjiakou News] Speculators, in order to reap huge profits, counterfeit the trademarks of state-owned Zhongfang (China Textile) factories and sell short-measure cloth, flooding the market and deceiving farmers. The Zhangjiakou Municipal People's Government, in order to safeguard the interests of state-owned enterprises, crack down on speculators, and improve urban-rural relations, conducted strict management of those selling fake cloth in the market in May. The first five days were a mobilization and registration phase. After inspection by the Municipal Administration for Industry and Commerce, the cloth was stamped with a "Verified" seal and sold in designated markets. Those who failed to report within the time limit, or refused to register, would have their cloth confiscated if discovered. During the inspection, it was found that a large amount of fake cloth was sold by merchants from Tianjin and Beijing, who often sold it through runners in hotels. In some cases, out of a bolt of twenty pieces of cloth, only the first piece was genuine, while the other nineteen were fake. The second type of fake cloth was iron-loom cloth produced by small hand-weaving factories in Tianjin and Beijing, which counterfeited the Five Blessings Cloth trademark. The third type was short-measure cloth, generally cut short by two or three yards, reducing the original yardage. Some even cut off ten yards. During the twenty days of inspection, more than a hundred bolts of fake cloth and short-measure cloth were discovered. The government, based on the industry to which the sellers belonged, the source of the cloth, their ability to identify genuine cloth, and confirmed evidence, confiscated the cloth or tore off the trademarks and returned it, depending on the specific circumstances. After this inspection, those openly selling fake cloth and short-measure cloth have disappeared, initially curbing the market for speculation and deception with fake cloth.

　　平津某些不肖布商
  　跑到张垣出售假布
  　张市工商局已查出处办
    【张家口讯】投机商人为牟取厚利，冒制国营中纺各厂商标的假标布以及抽码布，充斥市场，欺骗农民。张家口市人民政府为维护国营企业利益，打击投机商人，改进城乡关系，曾于五月份对市场出售假布者进行严格管理。开始五天为号召登记阶段，经市府工商局检验，加盖“验讫”章，在指定市场出售。过期不报，或拒不登记，经发觉即予没收。在检查中，发现大宗假布多由平津行商贩张出售，他们多在旅馆经跑合商脱手，有的一件布二十匹除第一匹为真布外，其余十九匹都是假布，其次是平津小型手工织布厂出的铁机布，冒制五福布商标，第三种是抽码布，一般的都抽去二、三码，把原来的码缩小，有的甚至抽去十码者。在检查的二十天中，共发现假布、抽码布百余匹，政府根据其所属行业，布的来源及其用途，有无识别真假能力，并取得确实证明，分别不同情况予以没收或撕去商标发还。经此检查后，假布和抽码布公开出售者已敛迹，初步杜绝了假布投机欺骗活动的市场。
