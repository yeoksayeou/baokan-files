　　Xinhua News Agency, Prague, 26th: Hungarian Workers' Party General Secretary and Deputy Prime Minister of Hungary, Rákosi, said at a mass rally in Prague on the 23rd: "The great victory of the Chinese People's Liberation Army is one of the factors that helped the Hungarian People's Independence Front win the recent general election."

　　Rákosi and other Hungarian government leaders came to Prague to exchange ratification documents for the Treaty of Friendship and Mutual Assistance signed between Hungary and Czechoslovakia. In front of thousands of workers, staff, youth, and soldiers, he elaborated on the factors that led to the victory of the Hungarian People's Independence Front, led by the Workers' Party, in the election, pointing out that three issues played a decisive role: (1) Hungary's three-year economic plan was completed seven months ahead of schedule; (2) the new five-year plan will begin in January 1950; (3) the development and achievements of the world's peace-loving forces. He said that the steps taken by the Soviet Union to defend world peace shortly before the election greatly helped the Hungarian people. The result of the Paris Four Foreign Ministers Conference was an important victory for the peace camp headed by the Soviet Union and a serious defeat for the warmongers. Then he praised the historical significance of the victory of the Chinese people.

　　At a banquet held by the Hungarian Embassy in Czechoslovakia on the evening of the 23rd, Rákosi said: "This afternoon, when I spoke about the situation in China at the mass rally, the audience applauded warmly. The imminent establishment of the People's Republic of China indicates that nearly 500 million people are closely organized around the Chinese Communist Party, which is good news for peace-loving people all over the world."

　　Xinhua News Agency, Peiping, 26th: According to a Warsaw dispatch from the Polish Press Agency: "China is entering the world stage as a major power and one of the most important factors for peace and democracy." This is the comment on the victory of the Chinese people by the Polish Democratic Party's organ, "Kurier Codzienny." The newspaper wrote: After liberating large areas of Chinese territory, Chairman Mao Zedong has convened the preparatory committee for the New Political Consultative Conference in Peiping. The parliament will produce a united government representing the will of all the Chinese people. For the rest of the world, an independent, democratic, and strong China is not a "yellow peril," but a factor guaranteeing the victory of the peace and democracy camp in the anti-imperialist struggle.

　　匈副总理拉科西
  　称颂中国人民胜利
    帮助了匈人民独立阵线大选获胜
    波报指出：新中国是保证和平民主阵营  在反帝斗争中取得胜利的一个因素。
    【新华社布拉格二十六日电】匈牙利工人党总书记匈副总理拉科西，二十三日于布拉格群众大会上说：“中国人民解放军的伟大胜利，是帮助匈牙利人民独立阵线在最近大选中获胜的因素之一”。
    拉科西这次和匈政府其他领袖来布拉格，是为了交换匈捷两国所订的友好互助公约的批准书。他在数千工人、职员青年和士兵的面前，阐述以工人党为首的匈人民独立阵线竞选获胜的因素，指出三个问题起了决定作用：（一）匈牙利三年经济计划提前七个月完成；（二）新的五年计划将于一九五○年一月开始；（三）世界爱好和平力量的发展及其成就。他说在大选以前不久，苏联为了保卫世界和平所采取的步骤，大大帮助了匈牙利人民。巴黎四外长会议的结果，是以苏联为首的和平阵营的重要胜利，也是战争贩子们的严重失败。接着他就称颂中国人民的胜利的历史意义。
    在二十三日晚匈牙利驻捷大使馆所举行的宴会上，拉科西说：“今天下午当我在群众大会上讲到中国局势的时候，听众热烈鼓掌。中国人民民主共和国的行将成立，表示近五万万人民紧密地组织在中国共产党的周围，这是全世界爱好和平人民的一个佳音”。
    【新华社北平二十六日电】据波兰通讯社华沙讯：“中国正在以大国及和平与民主的最重要的因素之一的身份，进入世界舞台”。这是波兰民主党机关报考兹尼快报对中国人民胜利的评论。该报写道：毛泽东主席在解放了大片中国领土之后，已在北平召开新政协筹委会。议会将产生代表中国全体人民意志的联合政府。对于世界的其他部分来说，独立、民主与强盛的中国不是“黄祸”，而是保证和平与民主的阵营在反帝国主义的斗争中取得胜利的一个因素。
