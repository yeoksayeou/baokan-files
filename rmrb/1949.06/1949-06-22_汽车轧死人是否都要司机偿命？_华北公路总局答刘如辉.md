Must Drivers Always Pay with Their Lives When a Car Runs Over Someone?
Reply from the North China Highway Bureau to Liu Ruhui

Editor's Note: Our newspaper previously received a letter from a car driver, inquiring about several questions regarding the responsibility for car accidents. We have forwarded it to the North China Highway Bureau for a reply as follows:

Comrade Ruhui:

The questions you raised in your letter are now explained as follows:

The North China People's Government has regulations regarding car driving and the handling of car accident incidents. Car drivers have an obligation to abide by these regulations. If there is a violation and an accident occurs, the driver will naturally bear considerable responsibility. The judicial authorities make different judgments and treatments based on the location, situation, statements from both sides, witness statements, photos, or diagrams of the accident. In some cases, the driver must pay with their life; in others, they do not have to; some are sentenced to imprisonment, some are fined, and in some cases, the injured party is responsible. It all depends on the circumstances of the incident. It is not the case that the driver always pays with their life regardless of the circumstances. Please feel at ease in your service and do not let this affect your work morale. As for local authorities, they should formulate local single regulations based on the government's regulations. Areas with car traffic should have regulations regarding car driving.

The nine questions you raised are explained separately below:

	1. A passenger, ignoring warnings, sits on the roof of the car and is thrown off, falling to their death, getting injured, or falling under the wheels and being crushed to death. — If a passenger is sitting on the roof, the driver has a responsibility to advise them against it. If the passenger ignores the warning and falls off the roof, resulting in injury or death, it is their own fault, and the driver has no responsibility.

	2. A passenger drops something, does not ask to stop the car, and jumps down to pick it up, falling to their death, getting injured, or falling under the wheels and being crushed to death. — The occurrence of the above situation is due to the passenger's lack of understanding of traffic rules or lack of experience. The driver should inform and explain the rules of car travel to the passengers before driving, making them aware of the danger of jumping off the car while it is moving, thereby reducing the occurrence of accidents. If this kind of situation still occurs after the explanation, the driver is not responsible.

	3. When testing the car at an intersection or in the city, someone holds the car from the left, right, or back, their hand slips, and they fall, dying, getting injured, or falling under the wheels and being crushed to death. — This situation is the responsibility of the person themselves. However, before driving, one should pay attention to whether there is someone holding the car from behind.

	4. When the car passes through a town or village, someone who has never seen a car before rushes out of their house to watch, cannot stop, and falls under the car and is crushed to death. — When a car passes through a small town or village, the driver should pay attention and drive slowly, because in small towns and villages, firstly, the roads are narrow, and secondly, cars are a rare sight. If the car is driven fast, it is easy to cause an accident. In this case, the driver has a responsibility to drive slowly to avoid accidents. If the above-mentioned incident occurs due to speeding, the driver is responsible for negligence.

	5. If the car's machinery malfunctions and becomes ineffective, causing it to hit and kill someone, crush someone to death, or overturn and stab someone to death, injure someone, or the driver dies, etc. — If the car's machinery malfunctions and becomes ineffective, resulting in injury or death, the driver should be held responsible for negligence in inspection.

	6. Is there a difference between crushing to death a child under ten years old and an old man of seventy or eighty compared to a young adult? — Children, young people, and old men are all lives and should not be distinguished.

	7. Is there a difference between being crushed to death by the front wheel and being crushed to death by the rear wheel? — In principle, there is a difference between the front wheel and the rear wheel injuring or killing someone. The rear wheel is not within the driver's line of sight, and the driver's responsibility should be less, but it still depends on the specific circumstances. For example, if the front wheel knocks someone down and then the rear wheel runs over them, the driver is responsible.

	8. The government orders that horse-drawn carriages are forbidden to use car roads, but in Shanxi, car roads have become free roads for horse-drawn carriages. — The government does not have a regulation prohibiting horse-drawn carriages from using car roads, but there is a regulation prohibiting iron-wheeled vehicles to protect the highway. What you heard is probably a rumor. In general, highways are now very important transportation roads in China, and naturally, various means of transportation—such as rubber-wheeled horse-drawn carriages, mule carts, and handcarts, bicycles…etc.—should be allowed to travel on the highways. When the road surface is narrow and there are many vehicles, the local public security organs should pay attention to maintaining traffic order (keeping to the right).

	9. A horse-drawn carriage is standing on the side of the road, and when the car approaches, the horse gets scared and moves, colliding with the car, the horse-drawn carriage is damaged, the horse is injured, and the horse-drawn carriage worker is crushed to death; or a horse-drawn carriage is standing on the side of the road, and when the car approaches, the horse gets scared and moves, the car is afraid of hitting the horse-drawn carriage and swerves outward, the horse-drawn carriage is fine, the car overturns, and the passengers in the car are thrown out, some die, some are injured, some are crushed to death, the car is damaged, or the driver dies. Is the horse-drawn carriage responsible for this? — This requires understanding the road conditions at the time and the speed of the car to determine responsibility. Generally speaking, it belongs to the driver's negligence. Because the horse-drawn carriage is parked on the side of the road, the driver should immediately slow down upon discovering an obstacle on the road. In an emergency, using an emergency brake can avoid danger. If one does not slow down or stop and an accident occurs, the driver should bear considerable responsibility.

The Transportation Department plans to have a set of "Measures for Handling Car Traffic Violations and Accidents," which will be promulgated and implemented after approval by higher authorities. These measures will be used to handle general traffic accidents and to determine responsibility issues. As for punishment, it will be carried out by the judicial authorities.

### 汽车轧死人是否都要司机偿命？  华北公路总局答刘如辉

专栏：询问与答复

    汽车轧死人是否都要司机偿命？
    华北公路总局答刘如辉
    编者按：本报前收得一汽车司机来函，询问有关汽车肇祸责任问题多项，特转华北公路总局经解答如下：
    如辉同志：
    你来信所提问题，现在说明如下：
    华北人民政府对于汽车行驶和处理汽车肇祸的事件，都有规定，汽车司机人对于这些规定是有遵守的义务的。如有违反，发生肇祸事情，自然司机要负相当责任。司法机关依肇事的地点、形势、双方申述、证人申述、照片、或图说等，加以各种不同的判决和处理。有的事件是要由司机偿命，有的事件不必偿命，有的判徒刑，有的罚款，也有的事件是要由被伤害方面自己负责。都要看事件的发生情况决定，并不是不分情况概由司机偿命。请你安心服务，不必因此影响工作情绪。至于地方机关，要根据政府的规定制定地方单行的法规。通行汽车的地区，应该有关于汽车行驶的规定。
    你所提的九项问题，分别解释如下：
    １、客人不听劝告，坐在车顶上，被甩下车来跌死、跌伤或跌入车轮底下压死。—客人如有坐在车顶情形，司机有责向他劝告；倘若客人不听劝告，坐在车顶上跌下，致伤致死，是咎由自取，司机无责任。
    ２、客人的东西掉了，他不说话叫停车，即跳下来拾东西，跌死、跌伤、或跌入车轮下压死。—上述情况的发生，是由于乘客对于行车乘坐规则不明，或缺少经验所致。司机应于行车前向客人报告讲解，使他明白行车时跳车的危险，借以减少事故的发生。如果经过解说，仍然发生此种情形，不由司机负责。
    ３、车行路口或城市试车等，有人在左右后边把车，手滑了跌下来，跌死、跌伤或跌入车轮底下致死。—这种情形是要由他本人负责的、不过在开车以前要注意后边是否有人把车。
    ４、车路过城镇村庄时，有人没见过汽车，由家急跑出来看，收脚不住，扑倒车辆下压死。—车路过小城镇村庄、司机人应该注意慢行、因为在小城镇村庄地方，第一车道窄狭，第二汽车是件罕物，车开快了，自然容易肇事，司机在这种情况下，有责任慢开，以避免出事。如果快开出了上述事件，司机是要负疏忽之责的。
    ５、假如汽车机件出了事故，失了效用时撞死人、压死人，或翻了车扎死人、跌伤人，或司机死亡等。—如果汽车机件出了事故，失去效用，发生伤人或致死的情形，应该由司机负检查疏忽的责任。
    ６、压死十岁以下孩童和七八十岁的老汉是否和青壮年人同？—幼儿青年老汉同是生命，不应有什么分别。
    ７、前车轮压死和后车轮压死有无分别？—前车轮和后车轮压伤或压死人，原则上是不一样的。后车轮不在司机视线以内，司机的责任应该小，不过还是要看当时情况而定。例如前轮撞倒，又由后轮压过去，这是要由司机负责的。
    ８、政府的命令，马车禁走汽车路，但山西的汽车路，直成马车的自由路了。—政府并无马车不准走汽车路的规定，只是为护着公路有不准铁轮车通行的规定。你所听的恐是讹传。一般而言，公路现在是中国很重要的交通道路，自然各种的交通运输工具—如胶轮的马车、骡车、以及手车、自行车……等都是要在公路上通行的。路面窄而车多时，应该由地方的治安机关注意维持交通秩序（靠右边走）。
    ９、马车在路上站在一边，汽车到了跟前，马害怕一动，和汽车撞上了，马车坏了马伤了，马车工人压死了；或马车在路上站在一边、汽车到了跟前，马害怕一动，汽车怕撞了马车，往外一让，马车没事，汽车翻了，把车上的客人甩下来，有的跌死，有的跌伤，有的压死，汽车坏了或司机死了，这由马车负责么？—这要了解当时道路情况及车行速度，才能判别责任。普通说来，是属于司机的疏忽。因为马车是停在路边的，司机发现路上有阻碍，应该立刻减速。如有紧急情况，用急杀车是可以避免危险的。不减速，不停车，出了事故，司机应负相当责任。
    运输处拟有一种汽车违章肇祸处理办法，经上级批准后即可公布施行。这个办法用于处理一般交通事故，以之判明责任问题。至于处分，是要由司法机关执行的。
