Behind the Scenes Musings

　　The Eagerness of the British People
    Although the British Labour government has cast aside the Anglo-Soviet treaty signed with its wartime ally, the Soviet Union, and thrown itself into the embrace of American imperialism as an accomplice, oppressing its own people and the people of its colonies; the eyes of the British people are clear, and the British people understand "Who is provoking a new war?" "Who will be sacrificed in a new war?" They also understand who is tying Britain to the "imperialist chariot" and "who is preparing to surrender to the United States?" Therefore, representing the eagerness of millions of British people, the Soviet Peace Trade Friendship Conference was held. They passed a declaration, expressing their sincere friendship to the Soviet Union, and advocating that the Labour government should fulfill the Anglo-Soviet treaty and liberate Britain from the control of American imperialism.

　　英国人民的热望
    尽管英国工党政府把与战时盟友苏联签订的英苏条约置诸脑后，投入美帝怀中作帮凶，压剥本国和殖民地的人民；但英国人民的眼睛是雪亮的，英国人民明白“谁在挑拨新战争？”“新战争将牺牲谁？”他们也明白是谁把英国系在“帝国主义的车子上”，“谁在准备投降美国？”所以，代表着千百万英国人民的热望，对苏和平贸易友好大会举行了，他们通过宣言，向苏联表示真诚友谊的决心，主张工党政府应履行英苏条约，使英国从美帝控制下解放出来。
