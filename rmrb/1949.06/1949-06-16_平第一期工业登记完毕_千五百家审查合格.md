    [This newspaper] report: The Beiping Municipal People's Government's Bureau of Industry and Commerce, in order to support industry and develop production, began conducting industrial registration on May 7th. The first phase of registration covered four key industries: dyeing and weaving, machinery and ironwork, metal smelting, and knitting. As of yesterday (the 15th), the majority of registrations have been completed. A total of 1,610 applications were received, of which 1,507 were approved after review and will be issued business licenses within days. Prior to this registration, the Bureau of Industry and Commerce convened meetings with each industry to explain the significance of the registration. Furthermore, the directors and supervisors of various industry associations enthusiastically assisted, resulting in the smooth progress of the registration work. Among the four industries registered, the dyeing and weaving industry had 513 registrants, with 439 passing inspection. The machinery and ironwork industry had 745 registrants, all of whom passed inspection. The metal smelting industry had 60 registrants, all of whom also passed inspection. The knitting industry had 292 registrants, with 263 passing inspection. Those who did not pass often had inaccurate forms or lacked shop guarantees, etc., but can continue to supplement their applications. Once the procedures are completed and the review is passed, business licenses will be issued. (Jie)
