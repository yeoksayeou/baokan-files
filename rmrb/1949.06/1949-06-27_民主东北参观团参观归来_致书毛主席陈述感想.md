　　The Democratic Northeast Delegation Returns from Visit
  　Sends Letter to Chairman Mao Expressing Thoughts

　　Wu Gengmei and 59 other democratic figures organized a Democratic Northeast Delegation almost two months ago to visit the Northeast. They spent more than forty days traveling through all the important cities and some rural areas of the Northeast, visiting many factories and mines, and returned to Beiping before the opening of the Preparatory Committee of the New Political Consultative Conference. On the 14th, all members of the delegation and those who accompanied them on the visit jointly sent a letter to Chairman Mao expressing their thoughts after the visit. The original letter is as follows: Respected Chairman Mao:
　　In order to personally experience the development of the Chinese people's revolutionary cause and New Democratic construction, a total of 59 of us chose the Northeast region to visit for more than forty days. We traveled through all the important cities and some rural areas of the Northeast, visited many factories and mines, contacted many people, and saw many great and moving scenes.

　　First of all, what impressed us most was that the Chinese people, who have always been regarded as a sheet of loose sand, have been organized and educated into a strong collective like steel under the leadership of the Communist Party of China and Chairman Mao, after a long period of struggle and training. The democratic centralism of the government has fully demonstrated its effectiveness—the masses have great freedom to express their opinions, and the central policies can be implemented to the lowest levels. Such a strong collective is unprecedented in Chinese history. In the near future, the revolution will be victorious throughout the country, and China will play a great role in the cause of world peace, which is beyond doubt.

　　Secondly, we have seen the development of the Northeast in education, justice, and economic construction, and especially that the broad masses of working people can now exert unprecedented creative power as masters of the country. This is a guarantee that China will become prosperous and strong and will be able to quickly embark on the socialist road.

　　Due to various major facilities and reforms, the entire social atmosphere has obviously undergone fundamental changes. The newborn vitality washes away the remnants of the old society, and the hardworking and simple style replaces the past extravagant and decadent morbid state. Here, the excellent work style of the CPC cadres and party members has played a significant role.

　　In summary, there are too many inspiring aspects of this visit to list them all. We deeply feel that all the excellent achievements should be attributed to the greatness of the people's power, the success of the leadership of the Communist Party of China, and the wise decisions and instructions of the Chairman.

　　After returning from the visit, we feel that our determination and belief in serving the people in the future will become more solid, which can be a comfort to the Chairman! We respectfully extend our highest regards to the Chairman.

　　民主东北参观团参观归来
  　致书毛主席陈述感想
    【新华社北平二十六日电】吴羹梅等各界民主人士五十九人，在将近两个月以前，组织了一个民主东北参观团，赴东北参观。他们以四十多天的时间，走遍了东北所有重要城市和若干农村，参观了许多厂矿，于新政协筹备会开幕前返平。十四日，该参观团全体人员及陪同参观者联名致函毛主席陈述参观后的感想。原信如下：敬爱的毛主席：
    为了要求亲身体会中国人民革命事业和新民主主义建设的发展，我们一共有五十九个人选择了东北这个地区去参观了四十多天。我们走遍了所有东北重要的城市和若干农村，看了许多厂矿，接触了许多人，也看到了许多伟大动人的场面。
    首先，使我们感到最重要的是：向来被人看作一盘散沙的中国人民，在中国共产党和主席领导之下，经历了长期的斗争和锻炼，现在已经组织成并教育成钢铁一样的坚强的集体了。政府的民主集中制已经充分发挥了效能——群众有发表意见的绝大自由，而中央的政策又能贯彻到最下层去。这样坚强的集体，在中国历史上是空前的。不久的将来，革命在全国胜利，中国对世界和平事业将起极伟大的作用，是无可置疑的。
    其次，我们看到了东北在教育司法等方面的改革和经济建设方面的发展，特别看到广大的劳动人民现在都能以国家主人翁的身份发挥前所未有的创造力量，这是中国前途富强，并能迅速走上社会主义道路的保证。
    由于种种重大的设施与改革，使得整个社会风气显然起了根本的变化。新生的朝气冲洗了旧社会的残渣，勤劳朴实的作风，代替了过去的奢侈颓废的病态，在这里，中共干部和党员的优良作风曾起了很大的作用。
    综括这次参观所得，使人感觉振奋的地方实在太多了，在此不能一一赘述。我们深深感到，一切优美的成绩，应当归功于人民力量的伟大，归功于中国共产党的领导的成功，归功于主席英明的决策和指示。
    同人等参观归来，感到今后为人民服务的决心与信念，将愈加坚实，这是可以告慰于主席的！谨向主席致最崇高的敬礼
    民主东北参观团：吴羹梅、于刚、邓裕志、李文宜、罗淑章、郑坤廉、王雪莹、王仲元、张曼筠、史东川、梁均、何成湘、常任侠、高静宜、程绯英、石振明、杨静仁、胡守愚、朱烈、刘玉厚、高祖文、尹华、徐涛、盛志侠、邓子平、李海、费振东、严信民、储安平、戴子良、王静之、蔡国华、黄适安、冯天正、李伯球、韩兆鹗、郭冠杰、管易文、张文、谭惕吾、陈此生、林汉达、陈劭先、马思聪、谭冬青、黄子彦、张西曼、杨子恒、李子诵、李丽莲、胡耐秋、赵钟、张永池、潘辑武、朱富胜、黄铸、张默涛、吕集义、石定康、胡一声、陈尚明、马龙章、沈知津、杜若君、金满成、冯伯恒、秦威、唐远之、孙留云、罗子为、秦元邦、章培　　
　  六月十四日于北平
