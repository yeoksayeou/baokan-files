Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, June 6th: Before the liberation of Shanghai, the corpses of over two hundred people massacred by the Kuomintang bandit gang have been successively discovered in Hongkou Park, Zhongzheng Park, Hongqiao Cemetery, the Kuomintang government's National Defense Ministry Bureau of Confidentiality, the puppet police headquarters, and other places. Among them, those who can be identified include students, workers, teachers, professors, shop assistants, police officers, telecommunications personnel, and bank clerks. Most of the corpses had shattered heads and mutilated limbs, making them difficult to identify. Some were buried alive in pits. According to a former Kuomintang police headquarters officer: "Mao Sen (the puppet Shanghai Police Chief and Kuomintang secret service head) said before the liberation of Shanghai: 'I will kill three thousand people before leaving Shanghai.' In the police headquarters alone, three hundred and thirty-six 'political prisoners' were killed. When Mao Sen finally fled, he personally shot and killed nine young people in front of the headquarters office. The number of people drowned in the Huangpu River is impossible to calculate. It is said that on the morning of May 24th, he also ordered Flying Fortresses (Shanghai Kuomintang police vehicles specifically for capturing and killing people) to use machine guns to sweep and kill more than three hundred people in Hongkou Park in three batches." According to the police officer, most of the victims were young people in their twenties. Before being killed, their eyes were tightly tied with handkerchiefs, their mouths were stuffed with cotton, and their arms were suspended upside down on the iron frames of trucks. The trucks drove them to secret execution grounds in the suburbs for mass slaughter and buried them secretly at night. Therefore, the names of most of the dead are unknown.

　　国民党匪帮逃跑前大屠杀
  　上海发现尸体二百
    被害者有工人学生教员职员
    【新华社上海六日电】上海解放前被国民党匪帮大批屠杀的人民的尸体，已经先后在虹口公园、中正公园、虹桥公墓、国民党政府国防部保密局、伪警察总局等地发现二百多具，其中可辨认者有学生、工人、教员、教授、店员、警士、电讯员、银行职员等。尸体大多头颅破碎、四肢残缺，难以认领。也有被挖坑活埋者。据原国民党警察总局警士说：“毛森（伪上海警察局长、国民党特务头子）在上海解放前曾表示：‘我要杀死三千人才离开上海’。单单在警察总局被杀害的‘政治犯’，就有三百三十六人。当毛森最后逃跑时，在总局办公室前还曾亲自枪杀九个青年。扔在黄浦江里淹死的无法计算，据说，五月二十四日清晨，他还命令飞行堡垒（上海国民党警察专门捕杀人民的汽车）在虹口公园分三批用机枪扫死三百多人。”据警士说，这些被害者多半是二十多岁的青年。在被杀害前，双眼被手帕紧扎、嘴里被棉花塞住、两臂被悬空反吊在卡车铁架上，由卡车开往郊外秘密刑场集体残杀，乘夜掩埋。因此，死者姓名多无法得知。
