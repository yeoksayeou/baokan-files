[Jizhong Electric] The cattail bag industry in Duliu Town, Jinghai, has gradually declined over the past decade due to the devastation by Japanese invaders and the Kuomintang. Before liberation, only 662 households and 1,089 people in the town were weaving cattail bags, producing approximately 3,000 bags per day. After liberation, the People's Government immediately began to restore this industry, first by helping to establish a supply and marketing cooperative in the Fifth Street, and lending 60 bundles of cattails (each weighing 60 to 90 catties), and directly lending 84 bundles of cattails and 2,930 catties of grain to impoverished weaving households. The cooperative purchased cattail bags and fans woven by various households and transported them to Tianjin for sale, and purchased cattails from Tianjin to distribute to the weaving households. Now the number of weaving households in Duliu Town has increased to 1,253 households with 1,705 people. The weaving technology has also improved. The current daily output is more than 10,200 cattail bags and 6,375 cattail fans.

　　静海人民政府
  　扶植独流蒲包业
    【冀中电】静海独流镇的蒲包业，十年来因遭日寇与国民党的摧残，逐渐走向萧条。解放前该镇织蒲包的仅剩六百六十二户，一千零八十九人，每日出蒲包约三千余个。解放后，人民政府即着手恢复这一行业，先在第五街扶助建立了一个供销合作社，并贷给蒲子六十个（每个六十斤到九十斤），又直接贷给贫苦的织蒲户共蒲子八十四个，粮食二千九百三十斤。合作社则收买各户织出的蒲包蒲扇等运往天津销售，并从天津买回蒲子配给各织蒲户。现在独流镇织蒲户已增到一千二百五十三户，一千七百零五人。编织技术也提高了。现日产蒲包一万零二百余个，蒲扇六千三百七十五把。
