[Jizhong Electric] Xinji Farm in Jizhong has established a promotion network in various counties of the Eleventh Special District to promote superior varieties. It has now established 27 promotion networks in 100 villages in seven counties, including Jin County, Wuqiang, Shen County, Ningjin, Gaocheng, Shulu and Luancheng. In April, the seven counties promoted a total of 4,930 jin of Sz cotton seeds, which can be planted on 821.7 mu of cotton. They also promoted more than 14,600 jin of Huanong No. 4 millet and 811 millet, which can be planted on more than 7,310 mu of millet. The methods of establishing the network are as follows: (1) Closely integrate with district cadres to understand the situation, and then hold mass meetings, veteran farmer forums, etc., to explain the tasks of the farm, introduce superior varieties, and point out the shortcomings of local seeds. (2) Establish a promotion network on the basis of the old foundation. Tatou Village in Gaocheng County led the selection of seeds, soaking seeds, and promotion of superior varieties last year. The masses have a understanding of the farm. This year, we will start with improving the old foundation. (3) Educate and mobilize heroes and models to take the lead. (4) Use mutual aid groups, small cooperatives or technical research groups to strengthen technical leadership and promote superior varieties. In addition, exhibitions are also held and introductions are given at training classes and district and village cadre meetings.
[Jinan Electric] In order to improve agricultural production technology, various counties in Jinan have established agricultural promotion farms. After the North China Agricultural and Forestry Conference, 22 counties including En County and Yongnian County established agricultural promotion farms one after another. The main tasks are to study and exchange production experience, breed and promote superior varieties, and manage nurseries to promote afforestation. According to the needs of the masses in various places, the focus of work is different. For example, En County and Qiu County's sandy areas mainly focus on afforestation. At present, the organizational structures of various counties are not yet sound, and leaders at all levels are now trying to equip cadres.

　　推广优良品种　辛集恩县等地设推广场
    【冀中电】冀中辛集农场为了推广优良品种，在十一专区各县建立推广网。现已在晋县、武强、深县、宁晋、藁城、束鹿栾城等七个县，一百个村庄，建立起二十七个推广网，四月份中七个县共计推广出斯字棉籽四千九百三十斤，可种棉八百二十一亩七分，推广出华农四号谷和八一一谷一万四千六百余斤，可种谷七千三百一十多亩。建网方式有以下几个：（一）和区干部密切结合，了解情况，然后召开群众会议、老农座谈会等，说明农场任务，介绍优良品种，指出本地种子的缺点。（二）在旧有的某础上建立推广网。藁城塔头村，曾于去年领导选种、浸种、推广优良品种，群众对农场有认识，今年即从健全旧基础着手。（三）教育动员英雄模范带头。（四）利用互助组、小型合作社或技术研究组，加强技术领导，推广优良品种。此外，并开展览会和在训练班、区村干部会议上作介绍。
    【冀南电】为提高农业生产技术，冀南各县设立农业推广场。华北农林会议后，恩县、永年等二十二个县先后成立农业推广场。以研究交流生产经验、繁殖推广优良品种，经营苗圃推进植树造林为主要任务。根据各地群众需要，工作重点有所不同，如恩县、邱县沙荒区即以植树造林为主。目前各县的组织机构尚不健全，各级领导现正设法配备干部。
