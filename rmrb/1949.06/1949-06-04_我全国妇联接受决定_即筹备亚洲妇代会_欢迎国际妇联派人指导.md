Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 3rd. The All-China Democratic Women's Federation held its fourth standing committee meeting on May 30th, deciding to accept the International Democratic Women's Federation's decision to hold an Asian Women's Representative Conference in China. Those attending the meeting included Standing Committee members Cai Chang, Li Dequan, Xu Guangping, Yang Zhihua, Kang Keqing, Zhang Qinqiu, Zhang Xiuyan, Luo Qiong, Shen Zijiu, Cao Mengjun, Lei Jieqiong, Liu Wangliming, and others, twelve in total. Executive Committee members Chen Shaomin, Tian Xiujuan, Liao Mengxing, Gong Pusheng, Zhao Feng, and others, five in total, attended as observers. The meeting began with Chairman Cai Chang reporting on the resolution of the International Democratic Women's Federation's Seventh Executive Committee regarding holding an Asian Women's Representative Conference in China. Following this, Zhang Qinqiu reported on the past preparatory work for the Asian Women's Representative Conference. After listening to the reports, the meeting decided to accept the International Democratic Women's Federation's Seventh Executive Committee's decision to hold the Asian Women's Representative Conference in China this autumn and winter. A reply letter will be sent to the Federation expressing enthusiastic welcome and willingness to immediately begin preparatory work in China, expressing hope that the timeframe for completing preparatory work will be stipulated, and looking forward to the International Federation sending personnel to China early to guide the preparatory work.
    Note: The International Democratic Women's Federation sent an inspection delegation to India, Burma, Malaya, and other places in February 1948 to investigate the situation of women and children in Southeast Asia, and at the Fifth Executive Committee meeting decided to hold an Asian Women's Representative Conference in Calcutta in October 1948. However, this decision was rejected by the reactionary Nehru government of India. Therefore, a preparatory meeting was temporarily held in Budapest, Hungary, on November 24th last year. Attendees included 37 representatives from 12 countries, including China, Vietnam, North Korea, Iran, India, Outer Mongolia, the Kirghiz Republic and Kazakh Republic of the Asian part of the Soviet Union, and invited representatives from the United States, Britain, France, the Soviet Union, and Albania. At this meeting, in addition to hearing reports from the inspection delegation and on the progress of preparations, the main issue was discussing where to hold the Asian Women's Representative Conference. The representatives at the meeting all expressed a strong desire to hold the conference in China in September 1949. The meeting decided to establish a preparatory committee composed of nine units, including China, Iran, India, Indonesia, North Korea, Vietnam, Kyrgyzstan, Kazakhstan, and the Secretariat of the International Democratic Women's Federation, with China, India, and Iran responsible for the regular work during the preparation period. Lu Cui was responsible for participating on the Chinese side.

　　我全国妇联接受决定
  　即筹备亚洲妇代会
  　欢迎国际妇联派人指导
    【新华社北平三日电】中华全国民主妇女联合会于五月三十日举行第四次常务会议，决定接受国际民主妇联在中国召开亚洲妇女代表会议的决定。出席这会议的有常委蔡畅、李德全、许广平、杨之华、康克清、张琴秋、张秀岩、罗琼、沈兹九、曹孟君、雷洁琼、刘王立明等十二人，列席执委陈少敏、田秀娟、廖梦醒、龚普生、赵锋等五人。会议首由主席蔡畅报告国际民主妇联第七次执行委员会上关于在中国召开亚洲妇女代表会议的决议，继由张琴秋报告关于亚洲妇女代表会议的过去的筹备工作。会议听取报告后，当决定接受国际民主妇联第七次执行委员会通过今年秋冬在中国召开亚洲妇女代表会议的决定，并复信该会表示热烈欢迎，愿意立即在中国进行筹备工作，希望规定完成筹备工作的时间并盼国际妇联提早派人来中国指导进行筹备工作。
    按：国际民主妇联曾于一九四八年二月派出考察团去印度、缅甸、马来亚等各地考察东南亚妇女儿童的状况，并在第五次执委会上决定于一九四八年十月在加尔各答举行亚洲妇女代表会议。但这个决定遭到印度尼赫鲁反动政府拒绝。于是去年十一月二十四日临时在匈京布达佩斯举行了一次筹备会议。到会的有中国、越南、朝鲜、伊朗、印度、外蒙古、苏联亚洲部分的吉尔吉斯共和国与哈萨克共和国、以及聘请的美、英、法、苏、阿尔巴尼亚等国代表共十二个国家三十七位代表。在这次会议上，除听取考察团及筹备的经过的报告外，主要的是讨论在何处举行亚洲妇女代表会议。会上各代表都热望一九四九年九月在中国举行。会议当决定由中国、伊朗、印度、印度尼西亚、朝鲜、越南、吉尔吉斯、哈萨克及国际民主妇联秘书处等九个单位组成筹备委员会，并由中国、印度、伊朗三个单位负责筹备期间的经常工作。中国方面由陆璀负责参加。
