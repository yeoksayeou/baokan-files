　　[Special Dispatch from Our Newspaper] Under the correct leadership of the Central Military Commission and the Military Commission's Ministry of Railways, and through the joint efforts of all staff and workers, the restoration and construction of China's railways have achieved brilliant results. The total length of railway main and branch lines in our country is 26,922 kilometers and 555 meters (including Hainan Island and Taiwan). Of this, 21,372 kilometers and 252 meters have been liberated, and 15,710 kilometers and 927 meters have been opened to traffic since our army's liberation. Currently, only 5,550 kilometers and 303 meters are still controlled by the Kuomintang reactionaries. The above totals include the five Railway Administrations under the Northeast Railway General Bureau: Harbin, Qiqihar, Jilin, Jinzhou, and Shenyang. The original total length of their main and branch lines was 11,066 kilometers and 403 meters, of which 9,971 kilometers and 73 meters are open to traffic. In the Northern Region, directly under the Ministry of Railways, the total length of main and branch lines is 8,454 kilometers and 255 meters, of which 8,081 kilometers and 535 meters have been liberated, and 4,579 kilometers and 321 meters in our region are open to traffic, with 372 kilometers and 720 meters still occupied by enemy bandits. In the Southern Region, south of the Yangtze River, under the Shanghai and Hengyang Railway Administrations, as well as Taiwan and Hainan Island, the original length of railway main and branch lines was 7,401 kilometers and 897 meters, of which 2,224 kilometers and 314 meters have been liberated, and 1,160 kilometers and 533 meters in our liberated areas are open to traffic. In total, across the country, the liberated railways account for 79.38% of the total length, those open to traffic account for 56.35% of the total length, and those controlled by the enemy, including Taiwan and Hainan Island, account for only 20.62%. Of the railways that have been liberated, 73.51% are now smoothly open to traffic, despite the very difficult conditions in terms of manpower and materials.
　　The arduous efforts of all railway workers, technicians, and the broad masses in the liberated areas have created immortal and glorious achievements in the rapid restoration and construction of the people's railways. After Japan's surrender, the Kuomintang drafted a plan to build 8,000 kilometers of railways in five years, but almost nothing was implemented. However, in the Northeast after liberation by the People's Liberation Army, even under war conditions, 2,640 kilometers were repaired last year, and 409 kilometers are planned for repair this year. In the Northern Railway, 3,270 kilometers are planned for repair this year, and work is currently underway. It is estimated that the entire project will be completed without any problems. The road repair project from Tianjin to Sangzidian on the Jinpu Railway was originally scheduled to open to traffic by the end of March, but the tracks were connected on March 24th, and it officially opened to traffic on April 10th, with twelve pairs of trains running daily from Tianjin to Xuzhou. The workers highly promoted the spirit of hard work and frugality, launching a movement to turn scrap iron into wealth, which solved the material difficulties. Workers in railway factories in Shijiazhuang, Changxindian, Tangshan, and other places in the Northern Railway further demonstrated their wisdom in their work, creating hundreds of innovations. Railway workers in the Jiangnan region protected railways and materials during the war, ensuring that railways were quickly restored to traffic as soon as the war ended, guaranteeing the continued valiant advance of the People's Liberation Army and causing the enemy to be captured before they could escape.

　　解放区人民和铁路职工艰苦抢修
  　万五千公里通车
    全国铁路两万七千公里已解放两万一千余公里
    【本报特讯】中国人民铁路的恢复与建设工作，在中央军委和军委铁道部的正确领导与全体职工共同努力之下，已获辉煌成就。我国铁路干支线全长共二万六千九百二十二公里五百五十五公尺（包括海南岛与台湾），已解放者为二万一千三百七十二公里二百五十二公尺，我军解放后已通车者共达一万五千七百一十公里九百二十七公尺。目前尚为国民党反动派残余所控制者仅有五千五百五十公里三百零三公尺。以上总数中包括东北铁路总局所属哈尔滨、齐齐哈尔、吉林、锦州、沈阳等五个管理局，全部干支线原长一万一千零六十六公里四百零三公尺，通车者九千九百七十一公里七十三公尺；北方区由铁道部直辖全部干支线八千四百五十四公里二百五十五公尺，已解放者为八千零八十一公里五百三十五公尺，我区已通车者四千五百七十九公里三百二十一公尺，尚为敌匪占据者三百七十二公里七百二十公尺；长江以南南方区所属上海、衡阳两管理局、及台湾、海南岛原有铁路干支线七千四百零一公里八百九十七公尺，已解放者二千二百二十四公里三百一十四公尺，我解放地区已通车者一千一百六十公里五百三十三公尺。总计全国铁路已解放者占全长百分之七十九·三八，通车者占全长百分之五十六·三五，敌人所控制者连台湾、海南岛在内仅为百分之二十·六二。而已告解放之铁路，虽在人力物力都很困难的条件下，已有百分之七十三·五一顺畅通车。
    解放区全体铁路职工、技术人员和广大群众的艰苦努力，对人民铁道的迅速恢复与建设，创造了不朽的光荣业绩。日本投降后国民党曾拟出在五年中修建八千公里铁路的计划，结果几乎一点也未实行。但在人民解放军解放以后的东北，去年一年，还在战争的情况下，就修复了二千六百四十公里，今年计划要修复四百零九公里；北方铁路今年计划修复三千二百七十公里，现正紧张进行中，估计全部完成当不成问题。津浦路由天津到桑梓店的修路工程，本来预定在三月底通车，结果在三月二十四日就接轨了，四月十日正式通车，由天津到徐州每天开十二对车。工人们高度发扬了刻苦兴家的精神，掀起废铁翻身运动，解决了材料困难，北方铁路石家庄、长辛店、唐山等铁路工厂工人，更在工作中高度发挥了自己的智慧，创造达数百种之多。江南各铁路职工，在战争中保护铁路、器材，做到战争刚告结束铁路就迅速恢复通车，保证了人民解放军的继续勇猛前进，使敌人来不及逃跑就纷纷被俘。
