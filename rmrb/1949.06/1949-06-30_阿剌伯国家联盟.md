The Arab League

The Arab League was established on March 22, 1945, shortly after the end of World War II. The members of this league include Egypt, Syria, Lebanon, Iraq, Transjordan, Saudi Arabia, and Yemen (which joined later). According to the league's declaration, its mission is to work together in consolidating the independence and sovereignty of Arab countries, as well as in diplomatic, economic, cultural, and social matters. Because this league is a diplomatic organization uniting various Arab countries, including those genuinely committed to guaranteeing independence and those dependent on British colonial policies, its steps in the movement to pursue the unity of Arab countries are inconsistent, and its actions sometimes contradict the wishes of the true Arab peoples. In early 1945, armed conflicts and bloodshed erupted in Syria and Lebanon as the people opposed the continued presence of French troops. At that time, the league made a resolution against the French military aggression, but when the Syrian representative requested all Arab countries to sever diplomatic relations with France, the Egyptian representative refused. In December 1945, the league issued a statement on the Palestine issue, expressing no hostility towards Jews and demanding complete independence. However, it did not demand the withdrawal of British troops. These actions and positions illustrate the internal contradictions and the limited extent to which it represents the wishes of the people. The Arab people have always had a friendly attitude towards the Soviet Union, especially appreciating the Soviet Union's just position on the Syrian and Lebanese issues. In September 1945, General Asa, the Secretary-General of the League, stated that he "did not want to participate in any anti-Soviet bloc," and said that "the Arab League, as an organ representing the interests of the broad masses of Arab countries, has no disagreements or misunderstandings with Russia." However, British imperialism never forgets to use the imperialist lackeys in the league as tools to exploit the people of the Near East and the Middle East and to instigate anti-Soviet activities.

　　阿剌伯国家联盟
    阿剌伯国家联盟，是在第二次世界大战结束不久，一九四五年三月二十二日成立的，参加这一联盟的有埃及、叙利亚、黎巴嫩、伊拉克、外约但、沙特阿剌伯、也门（后来参加）。依照联盟宣言，它的任务是：在巩固阿剌伯国家的独立和主权的事业上，而且也在外交、经济、文化和社会问题方面和衷共济。因为这个联盟是联合各个阿剌伯国家的外交组织，其中有真心真意保证独立的阿剌伯国家，也有依附英国殖民政策的国家，所以在追求阿剌伯国家统一的运动上，步骤参差不一，它和真正的阿剌伯各国人民的愿望有时是矛盾的。一九四五年初，叙、黎人民为反对法军继续驻留，各地爆发武装流血冲突。当时联盟曾作出反对法军侵略的决议，不过当叙利亚代表要求所有阿剌伯国家与法国断绝外交关系时，埃及代表却拒绝了它。一九四五年十二月间，联盟曾对巴勒斯坦问题发表声明，表示不仇视犹太人，要求完全独立。但却未要求英军撤退。这些行动与主张说明它的内部存在着矛盾，它的代表人民的愿望是有限度的。阿剌伯人民对苏联的态度一向是友好的，特别感谢苏联对叙、黎问题正义的主张。一九四五年九月间联盟总书记阿萨将军曾发表“不愿参加任何反苏集团”的主张，并说“作为一个表现阿剌伯国家广大群众利益的机关的阿剌伯联盟，与俄罗斯无任何的分歧与误会”。但英帝国主义是时时刻刻不忘记利用联盟中的帝国主义走狗，作为压榨近东与中东人民和挑拨反苏活动的工具。
