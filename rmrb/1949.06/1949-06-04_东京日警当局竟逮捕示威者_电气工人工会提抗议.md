　　Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 3rd. Reuters Tokyo reports: Tokyo Japanese police authorities carried out a large-scale illegal arrest on the night of May 31st. The sixty-five people arrested were all participants in the Tokyo demonstration against the "New Public Security Law" on May 29th and the demonstration on May 30th protesting the police killing of worker Kinjiro Hashimoto. The Tokyo Police Department announced that those arrested would be "extradited" to the U.S. military court to be "collectively tried for the so-called 'crime of disturbing public order.'" At the same time, Tokyo Imperial University also expelled twenty students on May 31st who participated in the recent strike. The barbaric measures of the police authorities have aroused the justified indignation of Japanese workers. The National Congress of the Japan Electrical Workers' Union, which is currently in session, passed a resolution on the 1st protesting the Yoshida government and the Tokyo police authorities' interference in demonstrations and the killing of Hashimoto.
