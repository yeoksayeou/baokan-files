Title: The British Labour Government - A Tool of Imperialism

One of the deceptive rumours about the British Labour government is that "the socialism we are now implementing in Britain" has not only ended capitalist production relations, but also ended imperialist policies.

This rumour was perhaps most thoroughly expressed in a boastful speech by Labour Prime Minister Attlee in 1947, when he said:

"If there is still imperialism in the world, I mean a powerful country using political and economic rule to enslave other peoples, then it is absolutely not to be found in Britain!"

Never has the truth been more distorted than in this statement!

The Attlee Labour government continues to pursue the old imperialist policy of "divide and rule." In India and Burma, the British Labour government had to make some concessions to the national independence movements, but at the same time, it gained the support of local bourgeoisie and landlords to jointly suppress the people's democratic movements. In Southeast Asia, the Nehru government has gradually become the center for implementing British imperialist aggression policies, especially in anti-communism.

It is at this time that the Labour government is intensifying its all-out colonial war in Malaya; in Palestine, it uses imperialist instigation methods to prevent its stability, while preventing Israel from becoming a member of the United Nations, and continues its evil policies in Transjordan. Imperialist conspiracies are intensifying throughout the Middle East. And it is doing its best to exploit Africa's resources.

The British working class has shouldered a series of heavy burdens of imperialist speculation, colonial wars, and so-called military obligations. On March 3, Defence Minister Alexander told Parliament:

"Our defence expenditure for 1949-50 is £760 million, an increase compared to the defence expenditure of £692 million a year ago, but the real increase is more than that."

Using a most conservative estimate, the cost of British armed forces overseas in the 1949-50 fiscal year consumes at least £107 million.

Is it true that wherever there are troops of the Labour government, there is "imperialism eradicated"?

According to official reports, British military bases are located throughout the following locations: Aden, Aqaba, Bermuda, British Honduras, Cyprus, Srinagar, East Africa, Suez Canal, Eritrea, Gibraltar, Greece, Hong Kong, Jamaica, Malaya, Malta, Singapore, Somaliland, Sudan, Tripolitania. There are also British garrisons in the Gold Coast and Nigeria in Africa. Britain has also signed military agreements with India, Pakistan, and Burma. A large number of British officers serve in the Indian and Pakistani armies. According to the British-Burmese agreement, only Britain is allowed to send foreign troops into Burma.

The British Navy and Air Force also have many bases throughout the British Empire.

This is a huge imperialist apparatus of aggression and exploitation, shamefully wasting human and material resources, draining Britain's wealth, and weighing heavily on the British working people.

However, Labour spokesmen, especially the "Daily Herald", are even more diligent in defending the British Empire than Churchill's Conservatives! Labour leaders intend to use the guise of "caring for the well-being of the lower classes" to conceal its imperialist conspiracy. There is no shortage of such cunning in recent official Labour statements, attempting to lay the foundation for next year's general election.

Official Labour propaganda recently boasted that the economic memorandum sent to the "Organization for European Economic Co-operation" has shown that the "British Four-Year Plan" can solve the current economic difficulties encountered.

However, this "Four-Year Plan" does not include any hope of improving the living standards of workers. On the contrary, it exposes the imperialist face of the Labour government. The so-called solution to Britain's economic crisis is nothing more than further exploitation of the colonial people.

Why is Britain fighting the people of Malaya? The reason is extremely clear: tin and rubber are Britain's main commodities for exchanging for US dollars.

Fighting the people of Malaya costs the British people £31,500 every day, a figure that is generally accepted as correct. As war expenditures are gradually increasing, the bourgeois press is also gradually increasing its sense of frustration. Imperialists hope to end the war against the people of Malaya as soon as possible. This kind of call was particularly high in the previous period.

The January 23 editorial in "The Observer" of London stated: "Progress is very slow... The hope of winning the war is less than the official statement."

The January 21 "Straits Times" said:

"The countryside is still in turmoil... There is no progress in the war."

The Labour government has exhausted means of threat and devastation against the people of Malaya. The British imperial authorities allow their subordinates to inflict retaliatory destruction on towns that "refuse to cooperate." On August 2nd last year, the "Village of Bakri Road" was destroyed for this reason; August 10th was "Pulai Village"; October 12th was "Paulison"; November 2nd was "Kajang" and "Batan Kari". Retaliatory measures are sometimes taken by burning down large numbers of houses. The most tragic times were on September 23rd in the "Li Hook Mining Area," when 80 houses were burned down; on September 24th, 80 houses were burned down in "Batu Arang"; on October 16th, 100 farmhouses were burned down in "Songai Seji Te". By December, air strikes and naval bombardment were also used.

This is Bevan and Attlee's "socialist policy of eradicating imperialism" in Malaya!

However, facts have proven that as long as the Labour Party continues to solve its economic crisis by exploiting British workers and colonial people, it will never succeed!

The facts are extremely clear that the plans listed in the so-called Organization for European Economic Cooperation memorandum are destined to fail. First, because the colonial people have increased their resistance to the Labour government's plan, because it inevitably leads to more intense exploitation. Second, because the suppression of the colonial people's resistance causes the British economy to bear an excessive military budget, while seriously lowering the living standards of workers, therefore, the working class's resistance to the Labour government's entire policy will also be similarly enhanced. Third, because this policy inevitably makes Britain more subordinate to US imperialism, making the US forces that have already invaded British colonies more active. The oppression of the United States reduces the living standards of British workers, slows down nationalization and social welfare, and all of this causes a greater loss, which is the loss of British independence.

Under the conditions of the Marshall Plan, US large enterprises have obtained the right to invest in the British Empire, and have all the convenience to collect the strategic materials that the US desperately needs to the United States.

When the policies of the British Labour government inevitably fall into the expansion plans of US imperialism, the contradictions between the two countries are not decreasing but increasing, and conflicts continue to increase on some specific issues. For example: in the competition for oil resources in the Middle East and the possession of strategic military and air bases, this is the case. When Bevan hoped to maintain Britain's position in the Middle East with the Arabs, the United States strengthened its power by forming an agreement with Israeli reactionaries, thereby weakening Britain's position.

The bankruptcy of Bevan's Palestine policy reflects the power of the two imperialist countries, and also reflects that in the face of US imperialist forces, it is impossible for the British Empire to maintain its original position no matter what means it tries. However, the above facts cannot be regarded as the basis for the complete breakdown of imperialist policy.

All these struggles for markets and investment areas are naturally still dominated by the cruel laws of capitalist development.

### 英国工党政府——帝国主义的工具

　　英国工党政府——帝国主义的工具
    英共总书记  波立特
    关于英国工党政府的虚伪传言之一，就是“我们在英国现在施行的社会主义”，它不仅已结束了资本主义的生产关系，而且也结束了帝国主义的政策。
    这个传言大概以一九四七年工党首相艾德礼的夸大演词中表现得最彻底，那时他说：
    “假如，现在世界上仍有帝国主义的话，我的意思是说一个强国施用政治的和经济的统治以奴役其他人民，那么，在英国是绝对找不到的！”
    从来没有比这段话更曲解真理了！
    艾德礼工党政府用着“分而治之”的手段继续执行陈旧帝国主义的政策。在印度和缅甸，英工党政府对民族独立运动不得不作了某些让步，但它却同时获得了当地资产阶级和地主们的支持，共同进行镇压人民民主运动。在东南亚，尼赫鲁政府已逐渐成为执行英帝侵略政策的中心，尤其是在反共方面。
    正是此时，工党政府在马来亚加紧进行其殖民地的全面战争；在巴勒斯坦则利用帝国主义煽动的方法阻止其走向安定，同时阻止以色列成为联合国会员的票决，在外约旦也继续着罪恶的政策。在整个的中东加紧了帝国主义的阴谋。并尽其所能的榨取非洲的资源。
    英国的工人阶级的肩头已担负起一系列沉重的帝国主义投机、殖民地战争和所谓军事义务的担子。三月三日，国防部长亚历山大曾向议会说：
    “我们一九四九——五○年的国防费用计七亿六千万镑，和一年前的六亿九千二百万镑国防费相比较是增加了，不过，其真实的增加当不止此数。”
    用一种最保守的推测来估计一九四九——五○的财政年度中英国海外武装军队的费用最少消耗是一亿零七百万英镑。
    是不是现在那里有工党政府的军队，那里就有“帝国主义绝迹”的事实呢？
    根据官方报告，英国的军事基地遍布下列各地：亚丁，阿恰布，百尔慕他，英属哄都拉斯，塞普鲁斯，塞里那加，东非，苏彝士运河，厄里特里亚，直布罗陀，希腊，香港，亚美加，马来亚，马尔他，新加坡，索马里兰，苏丹，特里波里坦尼亚。非洲的黄金海岸和尼加里亚，也有英国的驻军。英国且与印度、巴基斯坦及缅甸订有军事协定。大批英国军官在印巴军中服务，另据英缅协定，外国军队能开入缅甸者仅英国一国。
    英海军及空军在大英帝国各处也拥有许多基地。
    这是一个庞大的侵略与压榨的帝国主义机构，它可耻地浪费着人力与物力，它吸干了英国的财富，它沉重地落在英国劳动人民身上。
    然而，工党的发言人，特别是“每日论坛报”，其为大英帝国辩护之殷勤，较邱吉尔的保守党尤甚！工党领袖们打算借“关怀下层人民的幸福”作幌子遮掩住它的帝国主义阴谋。在最近几次的工党官方声明中不乏此种狡计，企图为明年大选打下基础。
    官方的工党宣传最近吹嘘说，送至“欧洲经合总署”的经济备忘录已经说明“英国四年计划”能解决当前所遭遇的经济难题。
    不过，这个“四年计划”并未包括任何改善工人生活标准的希望，相反的，它裸露出一付工党政府帝国主义面孔，所谓解决英国经济危机方法，不过是进一步榨取殖民地人民而已。
    英国为什么要与马来亚人民作战？理由是极为明显的，锡与橡胶是英国目前换取美元的主要货物。
    对马来亚人民作战每日要消耗英国人民三万一千五百金镑，这是一个公认正确的数目字。由于战费支出正逐渐增多，资产阶级的报刊也逐渐增长着沮丧的情绪。帝国主义者希望尽快结束对马来亚人民之战，前一时期这一类呼声尤高。
    一月二十三号的“伦敦观察家”社论中曾说：“进展甚慢……战事获胜之希望较官方之声明为少。”
    一月二十一日的“海峡泰晤士报”说：
    “乡村仍在骚动……战事毫无进展。”
    工党政府对马来亚人民用尽了威胁摧残的手段。英帝当局允许部下对那些“拒绝合作”的城镇施行报复性的毁灭。去年八月二号，“巴克里路村”因此毁灭了；八月十号是“普来村”；十月十二号是“保里森”；十一月二号是“卡桥”和“巴丹·卡里”。报复的手段有时是采取焚毁大批房屋的办法。最惨的几次是九月二十三号在“里·呼克矿区”，一次烧掉八十座房子；九月二十四号，在“巴图·阿朗”一次烧掉八十座房子；十月十六号，在“宋几·西肢特”一次烧掉一百座农舍。至十二月，又施用了空袭及海军炮轰。
    这就是贝文和艾德礼在马来亚的“帝国主义绝迹的社会主义政策”！
    然而，事实证明只要工党继续用压榨英国工人及殖民地人民的方法解决其经济危机，它便绝不能获得成功！
    事实摆得极为明显，所谓欧洲经合总署备忘录中所列出的计划是注定要失败的。第一是因为殖民地人民增大了对工党政府计划的反抗，因它不可避免地引向了更加剧烈的压榨。第二、因为镇压殖民地人民反抗，致使英国经济负荷着过度的军事预算，同时，严重地降低了工人的生活标准，因而工人阶级对于工党政府全部政策的反抗亦将同样地更加增强。第三、因为这种政策，不可避免的更使英国臣附于美帝国主义，使已经侵入英国殖民地的美国势力更加剧烈活动。美国的压迫使英国工人的生活标准降低，使国有化和社会福利缓慢进行，所有这一切，都造成了一个更大的损失，这就是英国的独立的丧失。
    在马歇尔计划的条件下，美国大企业获得向英帝国投资的权利，并有一切方便，把美帝所迫切需要的战略物资，收集到美国去。
    当英国工党政府的政策必然地落入美帝的扩张计划中去时，两国间的矛盾不是减少而是在加大着，对一些具体问题继续不断的增加了冲突。例如：在争夺中东的油源上和霸占战略性的军事和空军基地上，就是如此。当贝文希望同阿拉伯人维持英国在中东的地位时，美帝却以与以色列反动分子成立协定的方便而增强了自己的势力，因而削弱了英国的地位。
    贝文巴勒斯坦政策的破产，反映了两个帝国主义国家的力量，同时也反映了在美帝国主义势力面前，英帝无论想尽什么办法去维持其原地位也是不可能了。但，上述事实不能认为是帝国主义政策业已完全破裂的依据。
    所有这些为市场和投资地区的斗争，自然也还都是受着资本主义残酷的发展规律所支配的。
    　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　（未完）
