　　A Few Words
　　Eradicate Electricity Theft
　　After active inspection, the employees of the North China Electric Power Branch Company in Beiping and Tangshan have recovered a large amount of stolen electricity, which is a manifestation of being responsible for the interests of the country and the people. In the future, the most important thing is to inspire all citizens to more consciously abide by revolutionary order and mobilize the masses to supervise individual acts of theft and sabotage. Make everyone understand that it is shameful to disregard national interests and steal electricity for one's own convenience. Today, everyone is the master of the new China and the new society, and they must cherish the property of their own country.
　　Strengthen Education on Forest Protection and Afforestation
　　North China suffers from drought nine years out of ten. Although there are many reasons for this, one of the important reasons is that bare mountains are everywhere, and trees are scarce, which prevents the regulation of water volume. In recent years, the People's Government has paid attention to this and promulgated measures to protect forests and reward afforestation, and has achieved results in the old liberated areas. In the new and semi-old areas, the benefits of forest protection and afforestation have not been noticed by the majority of cadres in time. Therefore, since the beginning of spring this year, mountain fires have occurred continuously in the north and south of the Ping-Sui Railway and in western Ping. All localities, especially the leading aspects of the new districts, must strengthen the propaganda and education of forest protection and afforestation to the people in conjunction with the various mountain fires, so that the broad masses can recognize the importance of forest protection and afforestation, and automatically rise up to protect forests and vigorously plant trees, so that North China, which belongs to the people themselves, can be spared from the invasion of wind and drought disasters.

　　三言两语
    根绝窃电现象
    北平和唐山的华北电业分公司职工经过积极的检查，都追回了大量被窃的电流，这是对国家和人民的利益负责的表现。今后，最重要的是启发所有市民更自觉地遵守革命秩序，发动群众监督个别人的偷窃与破坏行为。使每个人都了解：为着自己方便，不顾国家利益，私自窃电是可耻的。今天大家都是新中国新社会的主人了，必须爱护自己国家的财产。
　　加强护林造林的教育
    华北十年九旱，其原因虽多，但到处童山濯濯，树木稀少，不能调节水量，却是重要原因之一。近年来人民政府已注意及此，颁布保护林木及奖励植树造林等办法，在老解放区并已取得成绩。在新区和半老区，护林造林的益处，则未为广大干部所及时注意，所以今年入春以来，平绥路南北及平西等地，不断发生烧山事情。各地尤其是新区领导方面，必须结合各次烧山事件对人民加强护林造林的宣传教育，使广大群众认识护林造林的重要性，自动起来保护林木，大力植树造林，使属于人民自己的华北，免除风灾旱灾的侵袭。
