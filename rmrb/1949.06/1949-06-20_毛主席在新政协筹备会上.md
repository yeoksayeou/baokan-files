　　The people of all China are looking forward to this day. June 15, 1949 – this historically significant day finally arrived. The inaugural meeting of the Preparatory Committee of the New Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) was unveiled on this day. Representatives of the Chinese Communist Party and various democratic parties, non-party democratic personages, and workers, farmers, youth, women, industrialists, intellectuals, ethnic minorities, and overseas Chinese will discuss at this meeting the major matters of convening a formal new CPPCC to establish the People's Republic of China government. The development of history is sometimes a leap. Last year on "May Day," the CCP proposed to the nation to convene a new CPPCC without reactionary elements, which quickly received a widespread and enthusiastic response. During the consultations between various parties, people hoped that the formal New Political Consultative Conference could be held in Peiping. At that time, Tianjin and Peiping were still occupied by the Kuomintang reactionaries, and whether this wish could be fulfilled depended on the historical process of the People's Liberation War. Who knew that a year later, the preparatory meeting of the new CPPCC would begin in Peiping? This is the result of the wise leadership of the Communist Party, the brave and good fighting of the People's Liberation Army, and the concerted efforts of the national democratic forces. Unity has defeated the enemy, and unity will also guarantee the establishment of a new China. This spirit, this atmosphere, is fully reflected in the CPPCC preparatory meeting.
    The venue was set in the Qin Zheng Dian (Hall of Diligent Administration) in Zhongnanhai. Simple, unadorned, and solemn. The rostrum was decorated with six military flags of the People's Liberation Army, and sixty red flags were arranged on twelve square pillars. The seats were in an arc, decorated with purple curtains. More than 130 representatives, from the mainland to the frontier, from home to overseas, from young to old, included workers, farmers, soldiers, women, and people from academic and industrial circles... They represented all the revolutionary classes in China. The representatives of the People's Liberation Army were all dressed in grass-green military uniforms, while the other representatives wore suits, uniforms, or long robes and mandarin jackets. Farmer representatives Shi Zhenming and Zhu Fusheng wore white homespun trousers and jackets, still in their farmer's colors from the fields. They stood up in the process of the people's revolution, came to Beiping from the remote northwest and east China, and discussed the great plan of building the country together with representatives from other fields.
    At 7:40 p.m., Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu, accompanied by Mr. Li Jishen, Mr. Shen Junru, and others, entered the venue. Chairman Mao was wearing a dark gray uniform and was in exceptionally good spirits. He came in quietly, obviously not wanting to attract special attention. People discovered him after all, and a warm round of applause broke out. Chairman Mao greeted them with a smile and sat in the first seat on the right front row of the rostrum, which was number "101". Comrade Zhou Enlai sat to his right. The front row of the rostrum was occupied by representatives of the People's Liberation Army, with Commander-in-Chief Zhu as the chief - number "102".
    Comrade Zhou Enlai announced "The opening of the Preparatory Committee of the New Political Consultative Conference," and people applauded wildly. The cameras captured this solemn ceremony one by one. The meeting, which represents a new page in Chinese history, was officially inaugurated. Chairman Mao, on behalf of the Chinese Communist Party, spoke first. He calmly and peacefully summarized the process of the Chinese revolution and pointed out where China would go. People listened to his speech intently while looking at his previously printed speech manuscript. Liu Yuhou stretched his neck, widened his eyes, and listened attentively. In the difficult days when the Hu Zongnan bandit gang frantically attacked the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia border area and Yan'an was temporarily evacuated, Chairman Mao led the fighting around Yan'an, and Liu Yuhou led the stretcher team in Longdong to support the front line. At that time, he was eagerly concerned about his leader and tried to find out some news from the team. Now, the war is won, and he personally sees his leader giving a historic speech. This excitement is incomparable. When he heard Chairman Mao finally say "Long live the People's Republic of China," he immediately smiled knowingly - a smile of victory.
    Commander-in-Chief Zhu, on behalf of the People's Liberation Army, declared that "The People's Liberation Army is the most loyal supporter of the Chinese democratic movement, and now it is the most loyal supporter of the New Political Consultative Conference and the democratic coalition government to be established." People applauded wildly. Everyone knows that without the heroic fighting of the People's Liberation Army, it would be unimaginable to hold such a meeting in Peiping. The People's Liberation Army has advanced Chinese history. When Mr. Li Jishen, Mr. Shen Junru, Guo Moruo, Mr. Chen Shutong, Chen Jiageng and other five gentlemen spoke, they all stated this truth: the people's efforts, the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, and the operations of the People's Liberation Army have given China today's victory and ensured the success of nation-building. Therefore, they feel supremely honored to be able to speak at such a meeting. Therefore, they unanimously stated that they are willing to engage in the sacred great project of building a new China under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao. Mr. Chen Shutong, a democratic person from the industrial world, with half a foot of silver beard, happily stepped onto the stage to speak. He spoke of China's victory, the glory of the Chinese people, and sincerely paid tribute to Chairman Mao. Chairman Mao, sitting in front of him, immediately stood up and bowed modestly in thanks. When Mr. Guo Moruo spoke, he emphasized: "Under the leadership of Chairman Mao, we will always be on the path of ascent." Many people nodded in satisfaction; Shi Zhenming stroked his short beard and smiled slightly. After the meeting, a reporter asked him, "What are your thoughts on the speeches at the meeting?" He said: "Everyone spoke very well. Mr. Guo said that following Chairman Mao, we will always be on the path of ascent. I really love to hear this sentence." Indeed, he fully understands this sentence, because his personal experience has already most eloquently explained the immortal truth of this sentence.
    During the ten-minute break, Chairman Mao left his seat and shook hands with the representatives to say hello. Wherever Chairman Mao went, it became the center of the venue. When he saw Mr. Huang Yanpei, Chairman Mao shook his hand and said, "Hello, how is your health?" When he saw Mr. Zhou Xinmin, Chairman Mao repeatedly said, "I've heard of you for a long time, I've heard of you for a long time." When he saw Mr. Tan Pingshan, the two shook hands cordially and talked intimately. When he saw Mr. Fu Dingyi, an old gentleman wearing a long robe and mandarin jacket, Chairman Mao asked with concern, "Is your health good? Is your eyesight better?" Mr. Fu smiled, touched Chairman Mao's shoulder with his hand, and said repeatedly, "Very good, very good."
    Comrade Zhou Enlai announced the continuation of the meeting, and Chairman Mao returned to his seat. He listened carefully to others' speeches and applauded others earnestly. The representatives who spoke passed by his seat and nodded to him, and Chairman Mao always bowed sincerely in reply. The meeting ended, and Chairman Mao left the venue with everyone. People quickly gathered around where he went. Representatives, guests, and staff members at the meeting greeted him. When Chairman Mao saw Ge Zhicheng, chairman of the Shanghai Primary School Teachers' Association, he immediately grabbed his hand and patiently talked to him: "Did you come to Beiping from Shanghai via Shandong?" "Yes, I came from Shanghai." Chairman Mao smiled and said, "You have done a very good job." Ge Zhicheng said, "This is because of your correct leadership." After a moment of contemplation, he said: "The primary school teachers in Shanghai all love Chairman Mao very much." Chairman Mao looked at the young man kindly, nodded modestly, and finally shook hands tightly and walked out slowly.

　　毛主席在新政协筹备会上
    全中国的人民都在盼望这一天。一九四九年六月十五日——这一个富有历史意义的日子终于来到了。新政治协商会议筹备会成立会在这天揭幕。中国共产党和各民主党派、无党派民主人士及工人、农民、青年、妇女、产业界、文人、少数民族、华侨的代表人物，将要在这个会上商定召开正式新政协，以建立中华人民民主共和国政府的重大事情。历史的发展有时候是飞跃的，去年“五一”，中共向全国各界提议召开没有反动分子参加的新政协，迅速获得普遍而热烈的响应。在各方函电磋商的时候，人们都希望最好能在北平召开正式的新政治协商会议。那时候平津还被国民党反动派盘踞着，能否如愿以偿，要被人民解放战争的历史进程所决定。谁知事隔一年，新政协的筹备会就在北平开始了。这是共产党英明领导、解放军勇敢善战及全国民主力量协同努力的结果。团结战胜了敌人，团结也会保证建设成立新中国。这种精神，这种气氛，充分反映在新政协筹备会中。
    会场设在中南海勤政殿。简单、朴素而严肃。主席台上装饰着六面解放军的军旗，六十面红旗分别排列在十二个方柱上。议席成弧形，饰以紫色幕布。一百三十多位代表，从内地到边疆，从本国到海外，从青年到老者，有工人、农民、军人、妇女与学术、产业各界人士……他们代表着中国各个革命的阶层。解放军代表一律着草绿军服，其余代表分着西装、制服或长袍马褂，农民代表石振明、朱富胜穿着白色土布裤褂，他们来自田间，依然是农民本色。他们在人民革命的过程中翻起身来，由遥远的西北和华东来到北平，和其他方面的代表一起商讨建国的大计。
    下午七时四十分，毛主席、朱总司令偕同李济深、沈钧儒等先生进入会场。毛主席着深灰色制服，精神异常健旺。他静悄悄的进来，显然不愿意引起人们特别的注意。人们到底发现了，一片热烈欢迎的掌声。毛主席含笑答礼，坐在主席台右前排第一位，那是“一○一”号。周恩来同志坐在他的右边。主席台最前排是人民解放军代表，朱总司令为首席——“一○二”号。
    周恩来同志宣布“新的政治协商会议筹备会开幕”，人们狂热的鼓掌，开麦拉把这庄严的仪式一一摄入镜头。代表中国历史新的一页的大会正式揭幕了。毛主席代表中国共产党首先讲话。他平静而安详地总结了中国革命的进程，指出了中国将往那里走。人们紧张地听他讲话，同时看着他那事先印就的讲演稿。刘玉厚伸着脖子、睁大眼睛，聚精会神的听着。在胡宗南匪帮向陕甘宁边区疯狂进攻，延安暂告撤守的艰苦日子，毛主席在延安周围领导打仗，刘玉厚在陇东领着担架队支援前线。那时候他热切地关心着自己的领袖，从队伍方面设法打听一点消息。现在，战争胜利了，他亲眼看到自己的领袖在作历史性的演说，这种兴奋是无可比拟的。他听到毛主席最后说到“中华人民民主共和国万岁”，立刻会心的笑了——胜利的微笑。
    朱总司令代表人民解放军，申明“人民解放军是中国民主运动的最忠实的支持者，而在现在它就是新政治协商会议及即将成立的民主联合政府的最忠实的支持者”，人们狂热的鼓掌。谁都知道，没有解放军的英勇奋战，在北平召开这种会是不可想象的。解放军推进了中国的历史。李济深、沈钧儒、郭沫若、陈叔通、陈嘉庚等五先生讲话时，一致道出这个真理：人民的努力、中共的领导、解放军的作战，使中国有了今天的胜利，也保证了建国的成功。因而对于自己能在这样的会议上讲话，感到无上的光荣。因而一致表示：愿在中共和毛主席的领导下，从事神圣的建设新中国的伟大工程。产业界民主人士陈叔通先生飘着半尺银髯，愉快的登台讲话。他说到中国的胜利，中国人民的光荣，诚恳的向毛主席致敬。坐在他面前的毛主席立刻站起身来，谦逊的折腰致谢。郭沫若先生讲话时，着重的说：“在毛主席领导下，永远走着上升的路。”多少人满意的点着头；石振明摸着自己的短须，微微笑着。记者在会后曾经问他：“你对于会上的讲话有什么感想？”他说：“每一位说的都很好。郭先生说跟着毛主席，永远走上升的路，这句话我实在爱听。”真的，他完全懂得这句话，因为他的切身经历，已经最雄辩地说明了这句话的不朽真理。
    会中休息十分钟，毛主席离开座位，和代表们握手问好。毛主席走到那里，那里成了会场的中心。见到黄炎培先生，毛主席握着他的手说：“你好，身体怎么样？”看见周新民先生，毛主席连声的说：“久闻，久闻。”看见谭平山先生，二人亲切的握手，亲热的谈话。看见身着长袍马褂的符定一老先生，毛主席关心地问长问短：“身体好么？眼睛好了没有？”符先生笑着，用手摸着毛主席的肩头，连说：“很好，很好。”
    周恩来同志宣布继续开会，毛主席重新回到自己的位置。他细心听别人讲话，认真地为别人鼓掌。讲话的代表路过他坐的地方，都向他点头致意，毛主席时时诚挚地欠身答礼。散会了，毛主席和大家一起离开会场，他走到的地方，人们迅速围拢来。代表、来宾和会中的工作人员，都向他招呼问候。毛主席看到上海小教联主席葛志成，立刻拉住他的手，耐心地谈起来：“你是从上海经山东到北平来的吗？”“是，从上海来的。”毛主席笑着，说：“你的工作作的很好。”葛志成说：“这是因为你领导的正确”。沉吟片刻，他又说：“上海的小学教员，都非常爱戴毛主席。”毛主席慈祥地注视着这位青年人，谦逊地点点头，最后紧紧的握了手，缓缓地走出门去。
