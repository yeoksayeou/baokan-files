　　On Building a New Nanjing
　　【Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, 15th】The Nanjing Xinhua Daily published an editorial on the 10th entitled "Striving to Build a New Nanjing - The Current Tasks and Directions of Effort for the People of Nanjing." The editorial began by stating: For more than a month since the liberation of Nanjing, under the close cooperation of the Military Control Commission with the broad masses of workers, staff, intellectuals, and democrats in Nanjing, the takeover work has proceeded smoothly. Nearly a thousand units of the Kuomintang reactionary government's military, economic, political, cultural, and social organs, enterprises, and groups have basically completed the work of receiving and inventorying, without suffering much destruction or loss. Such a huge amount of wealth returning to the hands of the people provides a considerable material foundation for the construction of the new Nanjing in the future. The editorial pointed out that the construction of the people's Nanjing should start with four tasks: First, to fully restore production, and gradually develop production on this basis. This is the key to building the people's Nanjing. At present, Nanjing's production base is very weak. The Kuomintang's twenty-two years of rule have turned Nanjing into a purely consumer city, fully demonstrating semi-colonial economic characteristics. Among the 1.2 million people in Nanjing, only more than 20,000 are real industrial workers. There are not many modern industries, some of which are for municipal consumption, and some are assembly-based – all raw materials and finished products rely on foreign imports. Therefore, building a new Nanjing is a very arduous task. However, after the overthrow of the Kuomintang rule, Nanjing has for the first time seen an environment that is free from imperialist aggression and the oppression of bureaucratic comprador capital, and is conducive to the restoration and development of production. Nanjing's transportation conditions, geographical conditions, resources, market, and labor conditions are all very good. As long as we correctly implement Chairman Mao's policy of "developing production, promoting economic prosperity, taking into account both public and private interests, and benefiting both labor and capital," and taking care of all aspects, relying on the working class, and uniting industrialists and businessmen to work together, the future of Nanjing's construction is very bright. Second, in order to ensure the smooth progress of production, the people of Nanjing must assist the Military Control Commission and the People's Municipal Government in completely destroying the remaining forces of the Kuomintang reactionaries, so as to prevent the Kuomintang secret agents and bandits lurking in Nanjing from engaging in any sabotage activities. Third, the large number of public servants, workers, servants and their families, as well as refugee students and Kuomintang soldiers remaining in the urban area, left behind in Nanjing by the original Kuomintang's huge bureaucratic organs and their affiliated institutions, totals nearly 100,000. Except for a part of industrial workers, technicians, and personnel engaged in physical and mental labor in academic institutions, many of them are people who do not engage in production. The threat of unemployment and school dropout is their greatest pain, and it is also a serious social problem at present. The current People's Government, in addition to running various schools and training courses, absorbing some unemployed workers, students, and public servants, training them to become talents for building a new democratic society, and funding refugee students to return to their hometowns to study and accommodating and repatriating Kuomintang soldiers to return to their hometowns for production, must also support and guide them to engage in production, so as to create a good environment for production and construction. Fourth, in order to successfully complete the task of building a new Nanjing, we must start to eliminate the remnants of the Kuomintang reactionaries' feudal fascist cultural propaganda, and strive to build a national, scientific, and mass culture. The most important task at present is to gradually transform education and actively transform educational institutions into institutions for cultivating a large number of useful talents for building a new democratic society. The editorial stated: The above four tasks must be combined with each other, and the restoration of production must be the central task.

  　论建设新南京
    【新华社南京十五日电】南京新华日报于十日以“为建设新南京而奋斗——南京人民当前的任务与努力的方向”为题，发表社论，社论首称：南京解放以后一个多月来，军管会在南京广大的工人、职员、知识分子和民主人士的通力合作之下，顺利进行接管工作，近一千单位的国民党反动政府的军事、经济、政治、文化、社会各种机关、企业、团体已经基本上完成了接收和清点工作，未遭受很多的破坏和损失。这样巨量的财富回到人民手中，使今后新南京的建设具备了相当的物质基础。社论指出人民南京的建设应从四项工作着手：第一是全力恢复生产，并在这个基础上逐步地发展生产。这是建设人民南京的关键。目前南京的生产基础十分贫弱，国民党二十二年的统治使南京变成一个纯粹消费城市，并充分表现半殖民地经济色彩。南京全市一百二十万人口中只有两万多人是真正的产业工人。近代工业为数不多，其中一部分是市政消费性的，一部分是装配性的——原料成品全靠外国输入。因此建设新的南京，是十分艰巨的工作。但是在推翻了国民党统治以后，南京第一次出现了不受帝国主义侵略与官僚买办资本压迫而有利于恢复与发展生产的环境，南京的交通条件、地理条件、资源、市场和人力条件，都是很好的，只要正确地执行毛主席“发展生产、繁荣经济、公私兼顾、劳资两利”的方针和照顾四面八方的指示，依靠工人阶级，团结工商业家来共同努力，南京建设的前途是很光明的。第二，为了保证生产事业的顺利进行，南京人民必须协助军管会与人民市政府彻底摧毁国民党反动派的残余势力，不使潜伏于南京的国民党特务匪徒有从事任何破坏活动的可能。第三，原国民党庞大的官僚机关及其附属机构留在南京的公务人员、工人、杂役和他们的家属，以及流亡学生和国民党军残留市区的散兵游勇等将近十万人之多。除一部分产业工人、技术人员、学术机构中从事体力与脑力劳动的人员而外，其中许多都是不事生产的人。失业失学的威胁，是他们最大的痛苦，也是目前严重的社会问题。现人民政府除开办各种学校和训练班，吸收一部分失业工人、学生、公务人员，培养他们成为建设新民主主义社会的人材，并资送流亡学生回籍学习及收容与遣送国民党军散兵游勇回乡生产外，必须扶助和劝导他们从事生产，以造成生产建设的良好环境。第四，为了顺利完成建设新南京的任务，必须着手肃清国民党反动派的封建法西斯文化宣传的遗毒，努力建设民族的、科学的、大众的文化。当前首要的工作，是逐步地改造教育，积极地把教育机关变成为培养大批建设新民主主义社会的有用人材的机构。社论称：上述四项工作必须互相结合，并须以恢复生产为中心工作。
