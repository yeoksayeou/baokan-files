　　New Children's Heroes
　　Chapter Nine: Life and Death
　　"Better put away your devilish calculations,
　　Wanting me to be a dog is hard, so hard!"...
　　The sun is setting, but there's still life in it,
　　When the moon comes up, it shines on corpses!
　　—Li Ji's poem
　　I

　　The night Niu Dashui and his group were rounded up by the enemy, they approached a large village. They saw piles of fires every few bows outside the village, and the Japanese were running back and forth. At the village entrance, the enemies in front stopped; the traitors shouted that the village was full. The Japanese left the captured men at the village entrance and took the women into the village.

　　Dashui anxiously thought, these women are going to be in trouble! He carefully watched the women pass in front of him, some with their heads down, some with tears in their eyes, some looking around in panic, and some holding children; when they were all gone, Yang Xiaomei was nowhere to be seen. Dashui thought with uneasy suspicion: "Where did Xiaomei go? Could she have been harmed?" As he was thinking, he got hit on the head, it turned out the people in front were moving again.

　　He followed them to a large field near the village. Around the field, piles of fires were burning brightly, and some Japanese were throwing doors and furniture into the fire. Dashui and his group had all the things they carried taken away, and suddenly felt very relaxed, but their necks were so sore that they couldn't lift their heads. The Japanese were eating in piles on the edge of the field. Dashui and the others just hoped to have a drink of water, everyone's throats were burning.

　　An old servant brought a bucket of water. The tied-up people immediately surrounded it, all wanting to stick their heads into the bucket to drink. Suddenly a Japanese officer came riding a big white horse and kicked people away right from his horse to let his horse drink. People were watching beside him. That damned horse snorted and slurped a full drink, its belly swelled like a melon, and water flowed down its neck. After the horse left and the bucket was empty, some people pitifully crawled on the ground to sip the mud; the others watched the horse-riding Japanese leave, their eyes wide with anger.

　　At night, the surrounding fires were still burning strongly. Dashui and the others were arranged in a chrysanthemum petal pattern with the enemy, sleeping on the large field. The captured people were inside, head to head, layer upon layer; the outermost two layers were the enemy. If they tried to escape, they would definitely step on the enemy, there was no way to escape. Dashui didn't sleep all night; some people sighed, and were scolded into silence by the sentry Japanese.

　　In the morning, the Japanese traitors ate breakfast and ordered them to stand in two rows, and then picked people out again. Niu Dashui was also picked out. The rest stayed in the village to build blockhouses; the selected group was escorted to the city. They were delayed several times on the road. It was dark when they arrived at a village, which was also full of enemies. Dashui and the others were driven into a very dirty courtyard; the Japanese occupied the cleaner north house, the puppet troops occupied the east house, and Dashui and the others were pushed into a row of small adobe houses on the west side and locked up.

　　Dashui and his group hadn't had a drop of water or a grain of rice for two days in a row, they were so hungry that their stomachs were stuck to their backs, and their throats were on fire; they were tired, hot, and everyone was dizzy and fell to the ground. Some people moaned, and the Japanese bayonets would poke through the window holes.

　　The Japanese had dinner and went to sleep. Two puppet soldiers were left on guard at the gate. The doors of the three small adobe houses were all locked. There were six people in Dashui's room, including village cadres, militiamen, and ordinary people. A seventeen- or eighteen-year-old boy was crying from thirst, saying, "Isn't this going to kill us with thirst! I'd be willing to drink urine; but I can't even pee!" Dashui thought and thought, but couldn't come up with a solution. The boy couldn't bear it and banged his head against the wall, crying, "How can I stand it, I don't want to live!" His head knocked the soil off the wall with a rustling sound.

　　Dashui was thinking about what Hei Laocai said: In difficult circumstances, we Communist Party members must lead the masses in struggle at all times... He heard the sand and soil falling from the wall, and suddenly had an idea; he whispered to the boy: "Brother, don't cry. Let's slowly think of a way." Dashui knelt up, feeling dizzy; he barely reached the window sill and waited. After a while, the puppet soldier on guard changed shifts, and a puppet soldier came over and looked into the window hole. Dashui stopped him, said many good things to him, and moved him with reason, and the puppet soldier agreed to fetch them some water.

　　Everyone heard that there was water to drink, and struggled to sit up. Dashui squatted on the ground, told them to come closer, and said softly: "Folks, we are all fellow sufferers, we have to discuss this. I say, if we are escorted to the city tomorrow, we will either be shot or beheaded, either way we'll die; we might as well grit our teeth and try to escape, this water that is fetched is our life-saving water!" He quietly told them a plan. The people whispered and discussed for a while, and all agreed.

　　The puppet soldier opened the door and brought in a small bucket of water. Everyone thanked him profusely and said good things. The puppet soldier happily said: "It's nothing, we are all Chinese!" He went out, locked the door, and went to the gate. Dashui told everyone to take a small sip to moisten their throats, thinking that he was a Communist Party member, he should "set an example", so he didn't drink any at all.

　　Dashui was tied to one end of the rope, and the boy was tied to the other end. Dashui and he back-to-back, groped to untie the rope for him. After a while, all six people secretly untied themselves. One person stood by the window watching, the other five were either wiping their foreheads with their handkerchiefs, or tearing off a section of their sleeves, dipping them in water, and gently applying them to the wall. The earthen wall became damp, and they dug with their hands.

　　After working for a long time, just as they were about to dig through, suddenly the person by the window bent over nervously and whispered: "They're coming, they're coming!" The six people quickly put their hands behind their backs, holding the ropes, and sat as they were before; Niu Dashui's broad back was against the dug-out hole; everyone didn't even dare to breathe. The puppet soldier opened the door and came in and said: "Have you had enough to drink?" The people hurriedly said: "We've had enough, we've had enough, you've really troubled yourself." The puppet soldier took the bucket out, locked the door again, and left.

　　Some people were so scared that they trembled and lost heart. Dashui said: "Don't be afraid! Put in a little more effort, and we'll succeed." Everyone gritted their teeth and dug nervously again; they forgot their thirst, forgot their hunger, and didn't know where the strength came from. After a while, they dug through. Dashui stuck his head out first, looked around, and then climbed out. Then, one by one, they climbed out, followed Dashui, slipped out of the village, and dispersed to escape.

　　II

　　Dashui wandered around in the fields for a few days, thinking: "It's not a good idea to keep running around like this, I should find a 'fortress household' and try to dig a hole."

　　At night, he sneaked into a village and jumped over the wall into Uncle Yin's house. Uncle Yin was an old man with a red face and a white beard, and he and his little grandson were eating; when they saw Dashui, the old man hurriedly got off the kang and said: "Dashui, you've finally come! We haven't seen our people for so many days, it's like there's no sun in the sky, it's really got this old man down." The child also called him "Uncle" and pulled Dashui to eat on the kang.

　　While Dashui ate, he asked: "What about the 'chicken coop' we dug?" Uncle said: "Isn't it right under your butt! It's perfectly fine, just waiting for you to come." Dashui comfortably ate a full meal, and Uncle lit a fire rope to drive away mosquitoes and told Dashui to sleep peacefully; he said: "With me here, nothing will happen! Don't think I'm old and can't catch ghosts, my ears are very sharp." The old man settled Dashui to sleep on the kang, and the grandfather and grandson sandwiched a tattered quilt and went to the roof to stand guard. The old man didn't sleep all night, and kept his ears open.

　　At daybreak, the enemy entered the village. The old man hurriedly woke up Dashui, took down the pot, and Dashui crawled into the underground tunnel inside the kang, placing the tin sheet over the tunnel entrance; Uncle then put the pot back on, added water, and started a fire.

　　The enemy searched house by house, searching this family. A traitor kicked Uncle Yin and asked: "Old man! Where are the Eighth Route Army soldiers hiding in your house?" Uncle Yin slowly stood up, held his ear with his hand, and leaned over to ask: "What did you say?" The traitor said loudly: "Asked if you have seen the Eighth Route Army?" Uncle Yin said: "Oh, oh, the Eighth Route Army? I've seen them, I've seen them! Wearing drab, gray, coarse cloth, and carrying guns!" The traitor hurriedly said: "Yes, yes, yes. Where are they? Tell me quickly!" Uncle Yin said: "Oh dear, there are so many of them! They're all staying in this village." The traitor hurriedly asked: "When did they come? Where are they all staying?" The old man said: "Don't be anxious, let me think! That day I was returning from the market, bought some New Year's goods, and it looked like the Kitchen God was about to go to heaven..." The traitor was so angry that he slapped him: "Damn it! Who asked you about last year's events? You old coffin filler!"

　　The Japanese roared: "Tunnel! Tunnel!" The traitor shouted into the old man's ear: "Asking you, where is the tunnel?" The old man squinted and said: "What? Tunnel? The year before last, I raised a big civet cat, wow, it looked like a good cat, it got rid of the mice so that they were nowhere to be seen, where would there be a tunnel?" The traitor shouted: "Damn you! Not a small tunnel, a big one, dug underground!" The old man stretched his head, listened carefully, and laughed, saying: "Oh! I understand this time. Hey, if I had known earlier, I would have led you there earlier. Follow me!" He led them to the back and pointed to the manure pit, saying: "Look! Isn't this it? My family only started this in March, there's not much manure yet! Don't believe me, look!" Saying this, he stirred it with a manure spoon for them to see. The stench made the Japanese pinch their noses and walk away; the traitor fanned his hand under his nostrils, his eyebrows knotted together, saying: "Okay, okay! Put it down quickly! You're a real thorny old man!" The group walked out cursing, saying: "Bad luck! What a jinx! To run into such a rotten old man!"

　　After they went out, Uncle Yin held his white beard, almost laughing his chin off; he quickly said to his little grandson: "My old man uses his mouth, you little kid use your legs; quickly run out and scout around again, we have to be more careful!" The little grandson agreed and ran out. (To be continued)

　　新儿女英雄传
  　第九回　生死关头
    “趁早收起你那鬼算盘，
    想叫我当狗难上难！”…
    太阳偏西还有一口气，
    月亮上来照死尸！
    　　——李季的诗
    一
    牛大水一伙，给敌人圈去的那天晚上，走近一个大村子。看见村外边隔几弓就有一堆火，鬼子跑来跑去的。到了村口，前面的敌人停下了；汉奸们喊着说，村里都住满了。鬼子就把抓来的男人们留在村口，妇女们都带进村去。
    大水心里着急的想，这些妇女要倒霉啦！他注意的看着一个个妇女从他面前走过，有的低着头，有的掉着泪，有的惊慌的望着，有的还抱着孩子；走完了，独独不见杨小梅。大水惊疑不定的想：“小梅哪儿去了呢？不是给糟害了？”正想着，脑瓜儿上梆的挨了一下，原来前面的人又走动了。
    他跟着来到村边的一个大场上。场的四周，也烧着一堆堆的火，有些鬼子还拿门窗家具往火里扔。大水这一伙，身上挂的东西都给拿走了，一下子觉得很轻松，可是脖子酸得抬不起头来。鬼子们围成一堆堆的在场边上吃饭。大水他们只希望能喝口水，谁的喉咙里都火烧火辣得难受啊。
    有一个当差的老头儿，提了一桶水来。一串串绑着的人们立时围上去，都想把头伸到桶里去喝。忽然一个日本军官骑着匹大白马来了，就在马上一脚把人踢开，让他的马饮水。人们都围在旁边看。那该死的马喷着鼻子，呼噜呼噜的吸了个饱，把肚子喝得滚瓜似的了，马脖子上还流下好些水。马走了，桶干了，有几个人可怜巴巴的爬在地上啜那泥浆；旁的人望着那骑马的鬼子走去，气得都瞪直了眼儿。
    夜里，四周的火堆，还是烧得很旺。大水他们和敌人排成菊花瓣儿，睡在大场上。抓来的人在里边，头对头，一层一层的；最外边的两层是敌人。要逃跑，一定会踩着敌人，怎么也跑不了。大水一夜没睡着；有人唉声叹气，给放哨的鬼子骂得不敢作声。
    早上，鬼子汉奸吃了饭，叫他们站成两行，又往外拔人。牛大水也给挑出来了。剩下的就在这村修岗楼；挑出来的一批，押着往城里送。路上耽搁了好几次。天黑，走到一个村子。这村也住满了敌人。大水他们给赶进一个很脏的院子里；鬼子把干净一些的北屋占了，伪军占了东屋，把大水他们推进西边一溜小坯屋，关起来。
    大水这一伙，一连两天水米没沾牙，饿得前腔贴后腔，渴得喉咙里冒火；又是累，又是热，谁都头昏眼花的倒在地上。有些人哼哼，鬼子的刺刀就从窗洞里通进来。
    鬼子吃过晚饭，都睡了。留着两个伪军在大门口放哨。三间小坯屋，都锁着门。大水屋里六个人，里边有村干部，有民兵，有老百姓。一个十七八的小伙子渴得哭了，说：“这不叫人渴死啊！喝尿也情愿；尿又尿不出哟！”大水想来想去，想不出个办法。小伙子熬不住，用头碰着墙，哭着说：“怎么受得了，我不活喽！”他的头，碰得墙上的土沙沙的落下来。
    大水正在想着黑老蔡的话：在艰苦的环境里，咱们共产党员，要时时刻刻领导群众作斗争……他听见墙上的沙土落下来，忽然心里一动，想起了一个主意；低声劝那小伙子：“兄弟，别哭了。咱们慢慢想办法。”大水跪起来，直发晕；勉强凑在窗户台前等着。等了一阵，放哨的伪军换班了，有个伪军过来，往窗洞里瞧瞧。大水叫住他，跟他说了许多好话，又用道理打动他，伪军答应给他们提此水来。
    大家听到有水喝，都挣扎着坐起来了。大水蹲在地上，叫他们都凑过来，小声说：“乡亲们，咱们都是难友，得商量着点。我说，明儿个押到城里，不是枪崩就是刀砍，反正是个死；倒不如咬咬牙，想法子逃出去，这提来的水就是咱们的救命水！”他悄悄的跟他们说了个办法。几个人嘁嘁喳喳商量了一会儿，都同意了。
    那伪军开了门，提进一小桶水来。大伙儿千恩万谢的说好话。伪军高兴的说：“没什么，都是中国人！”出去锁上门，走到大门口去了。大水叫每人喝一小口，润润嗓子，他自己想着是个共产党员，应该“起模范”，就一点儿也没有喝。
    大水是拴在绳子的一头，小伙子是拴在另一头。大水和他背对背，摸索着给他解绳子。一会儿，六个人都偷偷解开了。一个人站在窗口了着，那五个有的抹下头上的手巾，有的撕下一截袖子，沾着水，轻轻儿扑到墙上去。土墙闷湿了，就用手挖。
    弄了老半天，眼看着快挖透了，忽然窗边的人紧张的弯过腰来，小声说：“来了来了！”六个人急忙背过手，拿着绳子，照原来的样子坐着；牛大水那宽宽儿的背，贴着那挖开的洞；大家连口气都不敢出。伪军开了门，进来说：“你们喝够啦？”几个人忙说：“喝够了喝够了，真麻烦你啦。”伪军把桶提出去，又锁上门走了。
    有的人可吓得打哆嗦，泄了气儿。大水说：“别害怕！快加一把劲，就成功了。”大伙儿咬咬牙，又紧张的挖起来；忘了渴，忘了饿，也不知哪儿来的气力，一会儿就挖通了。大水先钻出个头去，望了望，就爬到外面。接着一个个都爬出去，跟着大水，溜到村外，就分散逃跑了。
    二
    大水在地里胡混了几天，心里想：“老这么东跑西颠的，也不是个事儿，找‘堡垒户’钻个洞试试看吧。”
    晚上，他溜进一个村子，跳墙进了尹大伯的家。尹大伯是个红脸白胡子的老头儿，和他的小孙子正吃饭呢；一见大水，老人家忙下炕说：“大水，你可来了！这么些天见不着咱们的人，真是有天没日头，可把我老头儿蹩坏啦。”那孩子也叫“叔”，拉大水上炕吃饭。
    大水一面吃一面问：“咱们挖的那‘草鸡窠’呢？”大伯说：“不是在你屁股底下哩！好好儿的，单等着你来呢。”大水舒舒服服的吃了一顿饱饭，大伯点起一根火绳，薰蚊子，叫大水安安稳稳睡他的觉；说：“有我在，百不怎么的！别看我门神老了不捉鬼，我耳朵可灵着哩。”老人家安顿大水在炕上睡下，爷爷孙子两个就夹着破被子，到房顶上去放哨。老大伯一夜没睡，尽支起耳朵听呢。
    天一扑亮，敌人进村了。老人家忙叫醒大水，端下锅，大水钻进炕里面的地洞，洞口搁好洋铁片；大伯又坐上锅，添了水，烧起柴禾来。
    敌人挨家搜查，查到这一家。一个汉奸踢着尹大伯问：“老头子！你家八路军藏在哪里？”尹大伯慢慢站起来，用手托着耳朵，凑过去问：“你说什么？”汉奸大声说：“问你见了八路军没有？”尹大伯说：“哦哦，八路军？见来着，见来着！穿的灰不济的粗布，还拿着枪哩！”汉奸忙说：“对对对。在哪儿？快说！”尹大伯说：“啊呀，可多呢！全宿到这村啦。”汉奸急忙问：“他们多会儿来的？都住在哪儿？”老头儿说：“你别忙，让我想想！那一天我正赶集回来，买了点年货，眼看灶马爷就要上天啦……”汉奸气得打了他一巴掌：“他妈的！谁问你去年的事儿？这个老棺材瓤子！”
    鬼子吼着：“洞！洞！”汉奸对着老头儿的耳朵嚷：“问你，洞在哪儿？”老人家眯缝着眼儿，说：“什么？洞？头年我养了个大狸猫，吓，一看就是个好猫，把耗子治得影儿也不见啦，哪还有洞呀？”汉奸嚷着：“你他妈的！不是小洞，是大的，地下挖的！”老大伯伸着头，仔细的听着，笑起来说：“哦！这回我可听明白啦。嗨，早知道，早领你们去啦。你们跟我来！”就领他们到后面，指着粪窖说：“你看！这不是啊？我家这是三月才起的，还没多少粪！不信你瞧！”说着拿个粪勺搅给他们看。臭得那些鬼子忙捏着鼻子走开；汉奸用手在鼻孔下面扇着，眉头拧成疙瘩儿，说：“得了得了！快放下吧！你他妈的真刺儿头！”一伙人骂骂咧咧的走出去，嘴里说：“晦气！倒霉！碰见这么个糟老头子！”
    他们出了门，尹大伯托着白胡子，差点儿笑掉了下巴；赶忙对小孙子说：“我老头儿出嘴，你小孩子出腿；快跑出去再打探打探，咱们得多提防着点儿！”小孙子答应着，跑出去了。（未完）
