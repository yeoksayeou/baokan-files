    [Ping City News] Yesterday, the grain market opened steadily. Flour sold the fastest, with a market transaction volume of about ten thousand bags. Flour prices were generally stable, but wheat rose slightly. Seeing that wheat prices had been falling for days, most flour mills sold flour first and then purchased wheat. Generally, wheat owners, seeing the quick transactions, mostly hoarded their grain and did not sell, so wheat rose by three yuan per jin. The Trade Corporation's grain branch still sold grain at yesterday's listed price, selling about 100,000 jin of various grains and 400 bags of flour. Other food grains remained stable. Due to the company's continuous sales of cotton yarn, the morale of general yarn merchants was low, and transactions were extremely limited, with each piece falling by dozens of yuan. In the cloth market, apart from a few vendors buying goods, there were still no large transactions. Cotton textiles generally fell in price. Sugar sales increased, as it is currently peak season. Other sundries were generally unchanged.

    昨粮价续平稳
    纱布杂货成交少
    【平市讯】昨日粮食市场开盘平稳，面粉成交最快，市场成交量约万余袋，粉价一般平稳，惟小麦稍升。各制粉厂见小麦连日下落，多先售面粉而后收购小麦，一般存麦主见成交快，多囤积不售，故小麦每斤上升三元。贸易公司粮食分公司粮价仍照昨日牌价出售，各种粮食出售约十余万斤，面粉四百余袋，其他各种食粮仍呈平稳。棉纱因公司连日出售，一般纱商心气低萎，成交极为有限，每块下落数十元。布市除少数摊贩买货外，仍无大宗成交。棉织品普遍下落。糖类适逢旺月，销售增多。其他杂货一般持平。
