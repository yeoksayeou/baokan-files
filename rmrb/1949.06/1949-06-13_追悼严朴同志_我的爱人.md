　　In Memory of Comrade Yan Pu—My Beloved
    Zhao Ying
    Comrade Yan Pu, my comrade-in-arms of twelve years, unfortunately passed away due to illness at 2:34 PM on June 5, 1949.

    Comrade Yan Pu joined the Chinese Communist Party in 1925. In the perilous environment over the past twenty-five years, he was arrested twice by the Kuomintang reactionaries. Once, under the threat of extremely cruel electric torture, he upheld the spirit of the proletariat and never yielded.

    He obeyed all work assigned by the organization, devoted himself wholeheartedly to work, and was constantly connected with the masses. During the civil war era, he led peasant uprisings in Wuxi, Jiangsu, gaining the support and love of the broad masses of peasants, which is why the Kuomintang failed to capture him many times. During the War of Resistance Against Japan, the broad masses of Wuxi organized anti-Japanese armed forces using the name "Yan Pu" as their banner.

    Comrade Yan Pu's arduous work style was consistent: First, when he was in the Northeast, he accepted the Party's assignment to work in the cold and arduous northern Manchuria. Second, during the 25,000-li Long March, he was ill, but he gave his only pack animal to other comrades to ride, while he walked with everyone day and night. Third, he always considered the public interest and had no personal demands; he had no savings during his lifetime. When the organization asked if he had money to use, he always said he did. During this serious illness, he repeatedly suggested stopping the use of a special nurse and switching to a lower-grade ward to save public funds. Comrade Yan Pu's spirit of unceasing struggle and iron will are eternally immortal. I will resolutely inherit his legacy and style, and fight for the Party and the people to the end, in memory of him and to mourn him!

　　追悼严朴同志—我的爱人
    赵英
    严朴同志，我十二年来的战友，不幸于一九四九年六月五日下午二时三十四分钟因病逝世。
    严朴同志是一九二五年参加中国共产党的，在二十五个年头的艰险环境考验中，前后被国民党反动派捕去过两次，一次在极惨酷的电刑威胁下，坚持了无产阶级的精神，终未屈服。
    他服从组织分配的一切工作，忠心耿耿地埋头工作，与群众是经常联结在一起的，内战时代，他在江苏无锡领导农民暴动，得到广大农民的拥护和爱戴，因而国民党多次未能捕获他。在抗战时期，无锡广大群众用“严朴”名字作旗帜，组织起抗日武装。
    严朴同志的艰苦作风是一贯的：一、他在东北时接受了党的任务到又冷又艰苦的北满去工作。二、他在二万五千里长征中身体有病，但他却将自己唯一代劳的牲口让给别的同志骑，自己整天整晚的跟着大伙儿走。三、他处处为公家着想，丝毫没有个人的要求；在他生前是没有一文积蓄的，当组织上问他有钱用没有的时候，他总是说有钱用。在这次严重的病中，他三番五次的提出停用特别护士，换次等病房，以节省公款。严朴同志奋斗不止的精神和钢铁般的意志，是永远不朽的，我将坚决继承他的遗志遗风，为党为人民奋斗到底，以纪念他，追悼他！
