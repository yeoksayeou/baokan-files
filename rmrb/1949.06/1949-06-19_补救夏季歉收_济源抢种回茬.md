　　Remedying Summer Crop Failure
  　Jiyuan Hastens Replanting
    [Taiyue Telegraph] Jiyuan's Third District is harvesting and threshing as they go, immediately irrigating the land for replanting (that is, planting other crops immediately after the wheat stubble) to remedy the summer crop failure. Wheat is the main agricultural product of the district, and this year it suffered from disasters, resulting in reduced yields. The district specially convened a meeting of all district secretaries and village chiefs and cadres, and determined that a concentrated summer harvest and replanting were the only central tasks at present, harvesting and threshing as they go, and rushing to plant at any time, ensuring that all irrigable land is planted. The entire village of Beiguanzhuang organized thirty groups to thresh wheat, irrigate the land, and plant after irrigation. Those who could not get irrigation in time, planted first and then irrigated. In three days, they rushed to plant 134 mu of drought-resistant corn (after the corn harvest, autumn vegetables such as cabbage can also be planted). According to statistics from twenty villages north and south of the Qin River, a total of 16,440 mu of irrigable land can be replanted. Villages far from the irrigation canals and inconvenient to irrigate carried water to plant seedlings. In Shuilongzhuang, some land could not be irrigated, so the masses dug wells to irrigate. According to village statistics, 3,500 mu of land has already been rushed to plant.
    [Another Telegraph] Jiyuan's Fifth District began harvesting wheat on the 24th of last month. After seven days, all twenty-four administrative villages in the district have mostly completed the harvest. The villages are now threshing, and it will all be completed by the 7th. Before the summer harvest, the villages had made sufficient preparations for buying sickles and repairing carts. The district organized 22 cadres, divided them into villages to directly lead and supervise, reaping each piece of land as it ripens, harvesting and threshing as they go, in preparation for replanting. The villages have all organized small-scale mutual aid, mobilizing men, women, old, and young to go to the fields together. For example, Wushan Town organized thirty-one mutual aid groups, organizing 340 male and female full and semi-laborers, and 35 children, to carry out the summer harvest. During the summer harvest, the villages are also selecting seeds. Lu Zhiming (chairman of the farmers' association) of Wushan Village has selected one dan and two dou of red bald wheat seeds; more than forty households in Shilotou Village are selecting seeds locally.

　　补救夏季歉收
  　济源抢种回茬
    【太岳电】济源三区随收随打，随即浇地回茬（即接着麦茬种其他庄稼）补救夏季歉收。麦子是该区主要农产，今年遭遇灾害，产量减低。区上特召开全区支书、村长干部会议。确定突击夏收、回茬抢种，为目前唯一的中心工作，随收随打，随时抢种，作到能浇的地全部下种。北官庄全村组织了三十个组，一面打麦，一面浇地，浇过就种。及时轮不到的，先下种，然后再浇。三天抢种一百三十四亩旱玉茭（玉茭收后，还可种白菜等秋菜）。据沁河南北二十个村的统计，共能浇地抢种一万六千四百四十亩。离水渠远，浇着不方便的村，就担水点种。水龙庄有的地浇不上，群众便打井浇地。据各村统计，现已抢种了三千五百亩地。
    【又电】济源五区从上月二十四号起开始割麦，经七天工夫，全区二十四个行政村，已大部收完。现各村正在打场，七号即可全部打完。在夏收前，各村买镰修车都作了足够的准备工作。区上组织干部二十二人，分到各村直接领导督促，熟一块割一块，随收随打，准备回茬。各村都组织了小型互助，发动了男女老幼一齐上地。如武山镇组织了三十一个互助组，组织起男女全半劳力三百四十人，儿童三十五人，进行夏收。在夏收中，各村并进行选种，武山村卢志铭（农会主任）已选好红秃麦种一石二斗；石露头村有四十多户就地选种。
