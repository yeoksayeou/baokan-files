　　Brief Comments
　　Bad Consequences
　　"In all work, commandism is wrong because it exceeds the level of awareness of the masses and violates the principle of voluntary action by the masses..." All our revolutionary work must be built on the basis of the people's conscious and voluntary action in order to unleash the people's magnificent power. Any commandist style, no matter how well-intentioned, will produce extremely bad consequences. The phenomena of false reports, sowing empty rows, and boiling cooked seeds in Wu Xun's cotton planting serve as a head-on blow to commandists. All commandists should take this as a warning and improve our production leadership.
　　Strengthen On-the-Job Training for Cadres
　　It is very necessary for the directly subordinate organs of the North China People's Government to pay attention to strengthening on-the-job training for cadres. North China has been completely liberated, and the liberation of the whole country is just around the corner. We are facing increasingly complex tasks of managing the country and the enormous work of peaceful construction. Only by strengthening our studies can we shoulder this important task. Especially in economic work, we are still elementary school students and must start from scratch, learning it diligently with greater effort. All organs must earnestly persevere, and responsible cadres should set an example and lead everyone in learning. The learning in some organs is still not very energetic, and this should be corrected immediately.

　　三言二语
　　恶果
    “在一切工作中，命令主义是错误的，因为它超过群众的觉悟程度，违反了群众的自愿原则……”我们任何革命工作，都须建立于人民自觉自愿的基础上，才能发挥人民雄伟的力量。任何强迫命令作风，不管是出自于任何善良动机，结果都会产生极恶劣的后果，武训植棉中发生这些假报告、耩空耧、煮熟籽的现象，是给命令主义者一个迎头痛击，一切命令主义者应引以为戒，改进我们的生产领导。
　　加强在职干部学习
    华北人民政府直属机关注意加强在职干部学习，是非常必要的。华北已经完全解放，全国解放就在眼前，我们面对着日益复杂的管理国家，和平建设的巨大工作，只有加强学习，才能负此重任。尤其是经济工作，我们还是小学生，必须从头学起，用更大的努力刻苦地去学会它。各机关必须认真坚持下去，负责干部尤应以身作则，带领大家学习。有些机关的学习，现在还不大起劲，应该立即加以纠正。
