　　[Special Dispatch from This Newspaper] Since the widespread launch of the conservation movement in various departments of the North China People's Government and its directly affiliated units, significant results have been achieved after more than two months. Various departments have created many new methods during the movement, and many moving examples have emerged. Taking electricity consumption as an example, according to statistics from nine units, including the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, the Ministry of Justice, the Ministry of Education, the Ministry of Civil Affairs, the North China Financial and Economic Committee, the North China Water Conservancy Committee, the North China People's Court, and the General Office, the total electricity consumption in April was over 9,000 kilowatt-hours, with electricity expenses amounting to 426,000 yuan. Calculated at 20 yuan per jin of millet at that time, this was equivalent to over 21,000 jin of millet. In May, electricity consumption significantly decreased to just over 4,700 kilowatt-hours, with electricity expenses totaling 415,000 yuan. Calculated at 59 yuan per jin of millet at that time, this was equivalent to over 7,000 jin of millet. Compared to April, electricity consumption was reduced by over 4,000 kilowatt-hours, approximately slightly less than one-half of April's consumption, saving over 14,000 jin of millet, which is slightly less than two-thirds of the total amount of millet equivalent to last month's electricity expenses. According to available materials, the electricity consumption situation in June is estimated to be even lower than in May. The reason for the decrease in electricity consumption is that unnecessary lights in offices, dormitories, corridors, and restrooms of various departments have been removed, and the remaining lights have been replaced with lower wattage bulbs. Originally, light bulbs in various places were generally 40 to 60 candlepower, and some even used 100 or 150 candlepower. Now, offices have been replaced with 25 to 40 candlepower bulbs, while dormitories and other places have been replaced with 5 to 15 candlepower bulbs. The use of electric stoves has been eliminated. In general, comrades have developed the habit of turning off the lights when not in use, and each department has someone specifically responsible for checking the electricity meter. In bicycle repair, 1,060 jin of millet was saved in May compared to April, and some comrades even personally repaired their bicycles. The Supervisory Yuan established a bicycle repair team last month, and the total cost for the entire month, including the purchase of parts, saved half of the repair costs. The Ministry of Industry and Commerce and the North China Financial and Economic Committee saved half of their repair costs in May because they repaired their bicycles themselves. In terms of gasoline usage, according to statistics from 42 cars of various departments and committees of the North China Government, as a result of strengthening education for drivers, democratically assessing wages, and repairing vehicles with problems, as well as establishing a system for calculating gasoline usage based on mileage, gasoline consumption decreased month by month. In April, each car consumed an average of 2.8 liang of gasoline per li, which decreased to 2.6 liang in May and further decreased to 2.5 liang in June. According to the military control commission's regulation of 1.5 gallons of gasoline per day for each sedan, the actual average daily gasoline consumption per car was 1.35 gallons in April, which decreased to 1.1 gallons in May and further decreased to 0.8 gallons in June. In addition, waste in water and office supplies has also been greatly reduced. Various units use recycled paper for office work, make their own envelopes, and try to conserve water as much as possible when washing clothes and faces, even calling on those with wells to avoid using tap water. The General Office has also drafted a reorganization plan for security personnel, which is estimated to reduce the total number of support staff by one-seventh. After exchanging opinions with various units, it will be implemented soon. The main reasons for achieving the above results are that the leading comrades of various departments generally attach importance to conservation, grasp it tightly, promptly convene cadre meetings to mobilize and deploy, and conduct inspections at any time. After most cadres and support staff truly recognized the significance of conservation, they separately proposed conservation methods and consciously abide by these decisions. In addition, some units have also had cases of saving food and clothing to donate rice to relieve famine. For example, 39 comrades from the Personnel Department, Party Committee, and Communist Youth League of the Enterprise Department voluntarily donated 1,655 jin of saved rice, and the support staff of the department's guest house made their own briquettes, saving 96 jin of millet in expenses. Conservation has become a widespread movement in various departments of the North China People's Government. The future problem lies in how to further deepen and implement the movement, and establish a complete set of systems to supervise and inspect at any time, so as to consolidate and develop the achievements already made, and develop this movement into various production and construction undertakings.

　　华北人民政府既直属单位节约已成群众性运动
    电费一项上月省米万余斤
    【本报特讯】华北人民政府各部门及直属各单位自普遍展开节约运动后，经过两月余的时间，已得到很多成效，各部门在运动中创造了许多新方法，涌现出许多动人的典型例子。以用电一项为例，根据财政部、工商部、司法部、教育部、民政部、华北财经委员会、华北水利委员会、华北人民法院和秘书厅九个单位的统计，四月份全部用电量是九千余度，电费开支是四十二万六千余元，以当时每斤小米二十元计，共折合小米二万一千余斤；五月份用电量则显著降低，仅为四千七百余度，电费共为四十一万五千余元，以当时每斤小米五十九元计，共折合小米七千余斤，与四月份比较，少用电四千余度，大约为四月份用电量的二分之一弱，节约小米一万四千余斤，为上月电费折合成小米总数的三分之二弱。六月份用电情形，据现有材料估计，一定比五月份还要低。用电减少的原因，是各部门办公室、宿舍、走廊及厕所等处不必要的电灯都已去掉，留下的都换成了烛数较小的灯泡。原来各处灯泡一般都是四十到六十烛光的，有的甚至用一百支或一百五十灯光，现在各办公室已换成二十五到四十烛光的，宿舍等处则换成五到十五支烛光的。用电炉的已没有了。一般同志在不用灯时都已养成随手关闭电门的习惯，各部并有人专门负责检查电表。在自行车修理上，五月份比四月份节省下一千零六十斤小米，有的同志并亲自下手修理；监察院上月成立自行车修理组，全月费用连购买零件在内共省了一半修车费。工商部和华北财经委员会五月份因为自己修理自行车，省了修理费二分之一。汽油使用方面，根据华北政府各部及各委员会共四十二部汽车的统计，由于对司机加强教育、民主评定工薪和修理好有毛病的车辆的结果，同时订出按里程计算汽油使用量的制度，用油量逐月减少。四月份每辆车平均每里路耗油二点八两，五月份减至二点六两，六月份更减至二点五两。按军管会曾规定每辆卧车每日用油一点五加仑，实际上四月份每辆车每日平均用油一点三五加仑，五月份降低为一点一加仑，六月份更降低为零点八加仑。此外在用水和办公用具方面也大大地克服了浪费现象，各单位利用过去的废纸办公，自糊信封等，洗衣洗脸都尽量节用，甚至号召有井的就不用自来水。秘书厅并已拟就一项警勤人员整编办法，估计约可减少勤杂人员全数的七分之一，待与各单位交换意见后，即将付诸实行。分析获得上述成绩的主要原因，是各部门领导同志一般地对节约重视，抓得紧，及时地召开干部会议进行动员布置，并随时检查；大多数干部勤杂人员在真正认识到节约的意义后，都分别打出节约办法，自觉地遵守这些决定。此外，有些单位并有节衣节食献米救荒的事情，如企业部所属人事处、党委会及青年团的三十九个同志自动献出节约米一千六百五十五斤，该部招待所的勤杂人员自己摇煤球，节省开支九十六斤小米。节约在华北人民政府各部门中已形成一个普遍的运动，今后的问题在于如何把运动更推向深入和贯彻下去，而且订出一套完整的制度，随时督促检查，以巩固和发展已得成绩，并将这一运动发展到各种生产建设事业中去。
