    [Our Newspaper] Yesterday (the 1st) was the Dragon Boat Festival. In the afternoon, the National Literary Congress Preparatory Committee held a reception at the Beijing Hotel to welcome representatives who had just arrived in Beiping from the Northwest, the East China Liberated Areas, Hong Kong, Shanghai, and other places to attend the congress. It also welcomed literary and art representatives who had returned from attending the World Congress for the Defense of Peace. Those present included Guo Moruo, Mao Dun, Zheng Zhenduo, Zhou Yang, Tian Han, Hong Shen, Shakov, Cao Yu, Cheng Yanqiu, Xu Beihong, Luo Jingyu, Dai Ailian, Cai Chusheng, Zhang Junxiang, Hu Feng, Gu Zhongyi, Zhong Jingwen, Yang Hui, Cao Jinghua, Ge Baoquan, Huang Lemian, Lai Shaoqi, Ke Zhongping, Ma Jianling, Zhou Wen, Chen Bo, and others, totaling over a hundred people. Mao Dun first reported on the work of the Preparatory Committee, followed by Tian Han reporting on his impressions of attending the Peace Congress, praising the great achievements of Soviet art. Lai Shaoqi and Chen Bo, literary and art workers from the First and Third Field Armies, and Ke Zhongping and Zhou Wen from the Northwest Delegation, spoke, unanimously supporting the convening of the Literary Congress and saying that the task of the congress should be completed in accordance with the literary and art policy laid down by Chairman Mao. They expressed their willingness to learn from the congress. Cai Chusheng, Zhang Junxiang, Yang Hui, and Huang Yaomian, representatives from Hong Kong and Shanghai, unanimously pointed out in their speeches that literary and art workers had been subjected to cruel suppression and persecution under the rule of the Kuomintang in the past. Today, they have truly seen the achievements of literary and art work in the liberated areas, and they are very excited and sincerely propose to learn from literary and art workers in the liberated areas. Cai Chusheng and Zhang Junxiang highly praised the recently released and performed film "Bridge" and the plays "Red Flag Song," "March of Democracy," and the opera "Soldiers and Civilians."
    Finally, the Standing Committee of the Literary Congress Preparatory Committee proposed that the Hong Kong and Shanghai representatives organize a Hong Kong and Shanghai delegation before the congress, and the Hong Kong and Shanghai representatives are currently preparing for this. (Bai Sheng)
    [Beiping News] Linguists Li Jinxi, Lu Zhiwei, Luo Changpei, Lin Handa, Ye Shengtao, Hu Yuzhi, Chen Dingmin, and Ye Dingyi held a forum on the reform of Chinese characters at the Teachers' University on May 29th. Comrade Wu Yuzhang, a pioneer in Chinese linguistics, also attended and provided guidance. After a wide exchange of views, those present agreed that Chinese characters must be reformed. In the past, in order to make it easier for the masses to learn, phonetic alphabets and Latin Roman alphabet phonetic schemes had been created, but opinions were not yet unanimous. In order to formulate a unified reform plan, detailed and precise discussions are needed in all aspects. For this reason, it was decided at the meeting to invite linguistic experts in Beiping to hold a larger-scale forum in the near future to discuss and study the reform of Chinese characters.

    【平市讯】此间语文学者黎锦熙、陆志韦、罗常培、林汉达、叶圣陶、胡愈之、陈定民、叶丁易等八人，于五月二十九日假师大座谈中国文字改革问题，中国语文学先进吴玉章同志也曾出席指导。到会者经普遍交换意见后，都认为中国文字必须改革，过去为使人民大众易于学习，曾有注音字母和制有拉丁罗马字母拼音等方案，但意见尚未一致，为制定统一的改革方案，还需要各方面再作详细精密的讨论。为此，会上决定于最近邀集在平的语文学专家举行一个规模较大的座谈会，以商讨和研究改革中国文字问题。
