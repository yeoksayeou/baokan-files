　　Taiyue Dispatch: The public-operated Jinhua Iron and Wood Factory in Yicheng County is currently speeding up the production of agricultural tools for the summer season. Since March, the factory has begun casting plowshares and harrow teeth, and since May 1st, it has also been rushing to produce wheat sickles and wooden shovels for the summer harvest. Because they are able to base their production on the needs of the masses during the agricultural seasons, their finished products sell quickly. For example, the several batches of plowshares that were cast have already been sold out, and before the wheat sickles have even been produced, many people have come to the factory to place orders. Once this work is completed, they will manufacture cotton carding cabinets and other items, as Yicheng produces a lot of cotton.

　　晋华铁木工厂
  　赶制麦镰木锨
    【太岳电】翼城县公营晋华铁木工厂，现正赶制夏季农具。该厂自三月份起即开始铸造犁铧、耙齿，从五月一号开始又赶制麦镰、木锨等夏收农具。因为他们能根据群众生产季节，所以成品销售很快，如犁铧铸造的几炉早已卖完，麦镰还未制出，就有许多群众到厂里来定购。这些活赶完了，翼城产棉多，就要制造弹花柜等。
