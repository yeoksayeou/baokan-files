　　Selling Products for Various Factories
  　Ping Department Store Branch
  　Consignment Department to Open
    [Our Dispatch] In order to support production in the city of Beiping, solve the sales problems for products, expand reproduction, and in response to the requests of more than ten factories, including Changcheng Industrial Cooperative and Chunhe Sporting Goods Factory, the Department Store Branch of the Beiping Municipal Trading Company recently decided to open a retail department to sell products for various factories on consignment. This is intended to support production and facilitate the people. The consignment department is currently under active preparation and will officially open soon. The types of goods that the department will sell on consignment include all department store items, groceries, hardware, electrical materials, stationery, paper, and knitwear within the company's business scope, as well as bulk goods produced in the city that are needed by the masses. Those who apply for consignment sales must first bring samples of the products to be sold on consignment and write a consignment letter stating the price, quantity, and the name and address of the consignor. If the company deems it necessary to sell the products on consignment, it will indicate the handling fee on the consignment letter, and both parties will sign it to serve as an official consignment certificate. The goods can then be transported for consignment sales. Although the price of the consigned goods has been determined in the consignment certificate, the consignor may also notify the company in writing if they wish to change it. After the company receives the actual consigned goods, it will issue a receipt for the goods to the consignor; the consignor must also issue a formal receipt to the company when collecting payment, and the receipts will be exchanged at the time of settlement. Payments will be settled weekly, and payments for large quantities of products can be settled at any time. The consignment fee stipulated in the consignment—that is, the handling fee—is a deduction of 1% to 5% of the selling price of the consigned goods (depending on the type of goods and the complexity of the procedure) as the company's handling fee. The company is responsible for the operating expenses, but the consignor is responsible for the stamp duty. The company is generally responsible for any losses of consigned items, but the consignor is responsible for losses due to force majeure. Many private factories have already gone to the company to negotiate consignment procedures. (Cheng Jie)
