　　Supporting State-Run Farms
  　People's Bank of Jizhong Branch Loans Ten Million
    [Reported by This Newspaper] The People's Bank of Jizhong Branch has provided loans to support the state-run farm located in the vast wasteland of eastern Huanghua County, Jizhong. The area stretches from the Bohai Sea in the east to Bandaojingzi in the west, Liuguanzhuangzi in the south, and Nanjian River in the north, covering approximately 1,800 square *li*. The terrain is low-lying, serving as a place where water from the south, north, and west converges before flowing into the sea. Water flows down natural gullies, and during heavy rainfall, it spreads across the plains. The soil is mostly black earth, suitable for rice cultivation. To improve agricultural technology and promote mechanized agricultural production, the Jizhong Administrative Office has decided to establish a state-run farm in this area. The People's Bank of Jizhong Branch, based on its plans, budget, and financial capacity, has tentatively provided a loan of ten million *yuan* to support it. The term of the loan is set at two years, with a minimum interest rate of two *li*, to be repaid in four installments, each installment representing one-fourth of the total amount.
