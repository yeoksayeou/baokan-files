　　Mr. Chen Shutong, representative of democratic figures in industrial and commercial circles, said:
    This Political Consultative Conference was earned by the Chinese Communist Party with painstaking effort, and especially the bravery of the People's Liberation Army is moving and admirable. Thanks to the leadership of the CCP, and everyone's sincerity, frankness, and harmony, we can see that future unity and cooperation are absolutely without question. Mr. Chen said that the industrial and commercial circles have gradually come to understand the CCP's policies on industry and commerce, and everyone knows that they must take the path of increasing production. He said that there will certainly be a program for industry and commerce in the CPPCC in the future, and the industrial and commercial circles should boldly pursue it. The New Democratic economic policy provides complete guarantees for the industrial and commercial circles, and also integrates individuals with the country. Now we know our direction, and we also know how we should act.
    The unity of all parties today is a manifestation of this conference. Everyone is following the leadership of the CCP. One thing at this meeting made us very moved, that is, the CCP is too serious and modest about the allocation of representative quotas. The CCP absolutely did not add one more representative than any other party.
    Finally, Mr. Chen said that he was particularly pleased to participate in this conference because the meeting could be held in Peiping (Beijing). He said that in the future, our industrial and commercial circles must take our thinking a step further and unite thoroughly in order to have a bright path. Today, we must no longer take a wait-and-see attitude, but strive to develop the economy of the new China and improve the living standards of the people.

　　产业界民主人士代表陈叔通先生说：
    这次政治协商会议是中国共产党用心血换来的，尤其是解放军的英勇令人感动和钦佩。由于中共的领导，大家的诚恳、坦白、和谐，我们可以看到将来的团结合作是绝无问题的。陈先生说，产业界现在已经渐渐了解到中共的工商业政策，大家都知道要往提高生产这条路上走。他说，政协中对于工商业的纲领将来一定是会有的，产业界是应当放胆去做的。新民主主义的经济政策使产业界完全有了保障，使个人与国家也打成了一片，现在我们晓得我们的方向了，我们也知道应该怎样来作了。
    今天各党派的团结，就是这次会议的表现，大家都跟着中共的领导走去，在这次会上有一件事使我们非常感动，就是对代表名额的分配中共也是太认真谦虚了。中共绝没有比任何党派加多一名。
    最后，陈先生说他这次参加大会特别感到高兴的地方是这次的会议居然能在北平召开。他说，今后我们产业界一定要把思想推进一步，彻底团结起来，方能有光明的路。今天我们决不能再取观望的态度，要努力发展新中国的经济，使人民的生活水准提高。
