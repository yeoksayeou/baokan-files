Xinhua News Agency, Zhejiang-Jiangxi Front, June 6th: A certain unit of the People's Liberation Army on the Zhejiang-Jiangxi front is conscientiously implementing mass discipline in the newly liberated areas, achieving good results. In the early stages of the southward advance, due to insufficient discipline education beforehand and the difficulties of continuous marching, violations of mass discipline occurred in some units. Since the political department of the unit strengthened discipline education and instructed leaders at all levels to take the lead in conducting strict inspections and supervision, the discipline of the troops has greatly improved. The political commissar and chief of staff of a certain regiment personally organized propaganda team members and battalion and company cadres to inspect discipline in each unit before each departure. Any violations of mass discipline were immediately corrected and dealt with. When the 3rd Battalion of this regiment left Changshan City in western Zhejiang, they conducted a preliminary inspection before the regiment's inspection. Before each departure, the political instructor of the machine gun company of the 1st Battalion of a certain regiment personally led the political work team to conduct a discipline inspection and bid farewell to each household to express their gratitude. In addition to implementing various regulations, the inspection teams of each battalion of a certain regiment established a reporting system on the implementation of discipline and circulated it to all departments for universal communication and education.

In order to ensure the implementation of good mass discipline, the unit, in addition to emphasizing compliance with the Three Main Rules of Discipline and the Eight Points for Attention, also stipulated: (1) Except for large units or small units acting alone that may request guides, no guides shall be requested casually. When requesting guides, remuneration should be given according to the distance of the journey, and the same guide should not be asked to lead the way too far. (2) Long-term seriously ill patients should be sent to sanatoriums as much as possible, and temporary seriously ill patients should be provided with stretchers by the troops, and no civilian porters should be requested. (3) The military and division political organs should organize strong reception teams to prevent stragglers from violating discipline in the rear. (4) When troops depart and the landlord is not at home, a farewell letter must be written, and if firewood is used, firewood tickets must be left and procedures completed. (5) Democratic government workers must not be forced to perform labor. (6) If the preceding troops have violated discipline, the subsequent troops should do a good job of handling the aftermath and improving relations between the army and the people. The above regulations have had very good results after being implemented in various units.

　　浙赣前线解放军某部　认真执行群众纪律
    【新华社浙赣前线六日电】浙赣前线人民解放军某部认真执行新区群众纪律，收到良好效果。该队在南进初期，由于事前纪律教育不够和连续行军的困难，在某些单位中曾发生违犯群众纪律现象。经该部政治部加强纪律教育，并责成各级领导干部亲自带头，进行严格的检查督促以来，部队纪律乃大为改善。该部某团的政委、参谋长等首长都亲自组织宣传队员与营连干部，于每次开拔前到各单位检查纪律。发现违犯群众纪律现象，立即纠正处理。该团三营在离开浙西常山城时，不等到团的检查，就先行检查一遍。某团一营机炮连每次出发前，政治指导员亲自率领政工组进行纪律检查，挨户道谢告别。某团各营的检查组，除执行各项规定外，并建立关于执行纪律的报告制度，和通报各部进行普遍传达教育。
    该部为保证执行优良的群众纪律，除强调遵守三大纪律八项注意外，并规定：（一）除大部队或小部队单独行动得请向导外，不准随便请向导。请向导时要按路程远近给予报酬，并不得请同一向导带路太远。（二）长期重病号尽可能送疗养所，临时重病号由部队负责担架，不得请民夫。（三）军师政治机关应组织强有力的收容队，以免掉队落伍者在后面违犯纪律。（四）部队开拔而房东不在家时，一定要写告别信，用了柴草，一定留给柴票和办好手续。（五）不得强迫民主政府工作人员服劳役。（六）前面部队如有违犯纪律现象，后到部队应代为做好善后工作，改善军民关系。上述规定在各单位执行后效果甚好。
