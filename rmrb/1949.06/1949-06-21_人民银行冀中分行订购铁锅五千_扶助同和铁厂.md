    Jizhong Electric Dispatch: The Jizhong Sub-branch of the People's Bank of China signed a contract with the Baoding City privately-owned Tonghe Iron Factory on June 7th to order 5,000 iron pots, equivalent to 4 million RMB. Upon signing the contract, the bank made the payment at the time, and the factory began delivering goods on June 20th, with full payment to be completed by August 15th. The quality insurance period for the pots is one month from the date of purchase by the user. If there are any leaks or explosions, the factory is responsible for replacement (with pot tickets attached). During the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang, the factory was forced to shut down. After liberation, there was a market for iron goods, but due to insufficient capital, there was still a shortage of raw materials. Currently, during the slack season, there are only sixteen workers and six staff members, producing only 800 catties of iron per day. Under these circumstances, the Jizhong Sub-branch, adhering to the spirit of supporting production and benefiting both public and private sectors, ordered 5,000 iron pots from the factory. The factory immediately went to Tianjin to buy 40 tons of iron and to Shijiazhuang to buy 20 tons of coal. With sixteen workers, using one ton of iron per day (each ton, according to the market scale, produces 130 pots), they can work for 40 days, enabling the factory to overcome the slack season and solving the difficulties of lacking raw materials and insufficient capital, allowing it to continue operating and expand production.

    订购铁锅五千
    扶助同和铁厂
    【冀中电】中国人民银行冀中分行营业处，于六月七日与保市私营同和铁厂订立合同，定购铁锅五千口，折人民币四百万元。合同签定，银行当时交款，厂方于六月二十日开始交货，至八月十五日付清。锅质保险期限，在用户买走一个月以内，如有漏孔爆炸等情，由厂方负责更换（附有锅票）。该厂在国民党反动统治时期，曾被迫停业，解放后，铁货有了销路，但由于资本不足，原料仍感缺乏，现又值背月，故仅有十六个工人，六个职员，每日只产铁八百斤。在此情况下，冀中分行营业处，本扶植生产、公私兼顾精神，向该厂定购铁锅五千口。厂方即积极赴津买铁四十吨，去石门买煤炭廿吨，以十六个工人，每天用一吨铁计（每吨市秤二千斤产一百三十口锅）能做四十天，使该厂得以渡过背月，解决了缺乏原料及资本不足的困难，使之能继续经营和扩大生产。
