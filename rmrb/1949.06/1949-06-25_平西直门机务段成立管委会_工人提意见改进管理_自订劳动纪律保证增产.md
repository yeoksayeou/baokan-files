    Pingxi Zhimen Depot Establishes Management Committee
    Workers Offer Suggestions to Improve Management
    Self-Defined Labor Discipline Guarantees Increased Production
    [This newspaper reports] The Xizhimen Depot, with 514 employees, has established a factory management committee. It has mobilized workers to study factory management by department on a conscious basis, and to formulate production plans and labor discipline. Prior to this, an ideological review meeting was held to resolve the disunity between staff and workers in the spirit of "curing the sickness to save the patient." The factory and some staff members made self-criticisms of their past bureaucratic work style and mistakes such as arbitrarily losing their temper with workers. Workers with bad habits (such as playing cards) also made self-criticisms. All were determined to unite to develop production. Subsequently, the workers put forward many constructive suggestions for future work, such as: staff and workers should discuss matters together, hold more meetings and think of more solutions, a certain locomotive needs a Class A inspection, and raw materials should be saved from certain aspects. The factory management committee analyzed and studied the workers' opinions, and then formulated a specific production plan until the end of July, such as repairing two air brakes, four defective locomotives, and repairing the air pump's steam cylinder, etc. In order to guarantee the completion of the task, they also discussed and formulated labor discipline, requesting approval from the higher authorities. For example, the first group proposed division of labor and cooperation, each being responsible for their own duties, democratic discussion when problems arise, and obedience to leadership after a decision is made. The second group proposed observing time and not being late or leaving early, not doing private work, and strictly prohibiting theft. Finish today's work today and help each other to advance. The third group proposed striving to conserve and not waste materials. The factory management committee is now preparing to study the labor discipline of each group and submit it to the higher authorities for approval and official announcement to the entire factory.

    平西直门机务段成立管委会
    工人提意见改进管理
    自订劳动纪律保证增产
    【本报讯】拥有职工五一四人的西直门机务段厂内，自成立工厂管理委员会以来，即发动工人在自觉的基础上分别部门研究工厂管理，制订生产计划与劳动纪律。事前曾召开思想检讨会，以治病救人的精神解除了职员与工人之间不团结的现象。厂方与某些职员向大家检讨了过去的官僚主义作风，对工人随意发脾气等错误。工人中有不良习惯（如打牌等）的，也作了检讨。都决心为了发展生产而团结起来。接着，工人们对今后工作提出了很多建设性的意见，例如：职员同工人有事大家商量，多开会多想办法，某某机车须要甲检，原料从那些方面节省等。工厂管委会即根据工人们的意见分析研究后，制定了到七月底的具体生产计划。如修理两个风闸，四台病机车，修理风泵错汽室缸等。为了保证完成任务，并讨论制订劳动纪律，要求上级批准。如第一小组提出分工合作，各负其责，有事民主讨论，决定后服从领导等。第二组提出遵守时间不迟到，不早退，不做私活，严禁偷窃。今天的工作今天完，要互助前进。第三小组提出努力节约，不浪费资材等。现工厂管委会准备将各小组的劳动纪律加以研究，呈请上级批准，正式公布全厂。
