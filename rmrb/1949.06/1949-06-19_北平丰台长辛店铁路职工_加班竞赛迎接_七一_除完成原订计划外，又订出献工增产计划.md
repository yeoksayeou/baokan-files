　　Railway Workers in Changxindian, Fengtai, Beiping, Launch Overtime Competition to Welcome "July 1st"
　　In Addition to Completing the Original Plan, They Also Devised a Work Contribution and Production Increase Plan
　　[Our Newspaper] To welcome the 28th anniversary of the founding of the Chinese Communist Party – "July 1st" – over forty units including railway workers in Beiping, Changxindian, and Fengtai, as well as the Beiping Postal Administration and the North China Highway Transportation Bureau, are working with unparalleled enthusiasm to increase production. Railway workers in Beiping and other places are generally working overtime for two hours automatically, and have set out production increase plans to welcome "July 1st." Workers at the Fengtai Locomotive Depot are additionally refurbishing a "Fengtai July 1st" locomotive. Workers at the Engineering Section will additionally make two hand-cranked cars, and track maintenance workers have formulated a road maintenance plan. The Beiping Electric Section's Beiping Power Work Area plans to repair generator car No. 49056 within twenty days, naming it "People's." The Pingjin Railway Bureau has also decided to implement a new traffic system on the entire railway from "July 1st." The Beihe Bridge Work Section of the Pingbao Road Construction Office has decided to open the Beihe Bridge to traffic ahead of schedule on "July 1st." From workers and staff to engineers, the Changxindian Railway Section of the Pingjin Railway Bureau are all mutually engaging in competition. The workers at the Electric Machinery Factory wrote in their production plan to welcome "July 1st": "To revive the 300-horsepower dead motor, we have decided to complete all preparatory work before "July 1st," and to automatically work overtime from June 5th to overhaul the factory's various overhead shaft electric motors." In order to revive the No. 672 dead locomotive, the Locomotive Department is stepping up the provision of electrical and steam equipment for the car, and repairing two broken and abandoned locomotive generators. The Metering Department manufactured a test meter, and newly built five coil-wound electric controller (including 2,500 self-made parts). The Boiler Repair Department wants to strive to repair the electric pump and well faucet that have not been used for more than a year, and to automatically work overtime to overhaul the entire plant's air pipes, water pipes, steam pipes, and four heating boilers. The Boiler Factory decided to complete the repair of the 45-ton crane's boilers No. 1 and No. 2. The Repair Shop repaired a broken and unusable 30-horsepower motorcycle, and rushed to repair a large iron straightening machine and two water pumps, and three boiler tops. The Beiping Locomotive Depot was originally a garage during the Kuomintang rule, and did not undertake additional or reduction tasks. After liberation, due to the workers' high enthusiasm for labor, they consciously turned the garage into an additional and reduction locomotive depot. When the workers personally created the "May 1st" locomotive, they overcame all the difficulties of incomplete equipment and refurbished waste into a new "May 1st" that can travel long distances. Now, to welcome "July 1st," they are refurbishing two locomotives in the same spirit. The "Youth" is now only missing a spring, and another is being rushed to install. The Engineering Section is striving to complete 1,000 Western hoe handles in their spare time, but lacking wood, the workers are studying to dig up the dry and dead trees on the city walls as raw materials for the Western hoe handles. The Inspection Section is welcoming "July 1st" by repairing ten passenger cars. More than a dozen units of the Beiping Telecommunications Section have formulated production increase plans based on the specific business of their units, as a "July 1st" gift. The Xizhimen Locomotive Depot wants to refurbish and revive the Japanese-ruled ムㄞ No. 1, No. 1516 locomotive. Without the tools and raw materials for additional inspection, the workers researched a copper melting furnace, which can make small flue pipes and copper rods. Without an additional inspection trench, they used the garage's inspection trench and repaired it with old jacks. The source of copper was all collected waste copper. In addition to making 18,000 spikes, a new set of turnouts, and seven sets of old turnouts from the waste iron buried underground during the enemy and puppet era, the workers in the blacksmith shop of the Engineering Section of Xizhimen Section are also actively building a large auditorium.
　　All units under the Beiping Postal Administration are welcoming "July 1st" by creating a study movement, and the Parcel Department plans to complete 10,000 parcels to welcome "July 1st."

　　北平丰台长辛店铁路职工
  　加班竞赛迎接“七一”
    除完成原订计划外，又订出献工增产计划
    【本报讯】北平、长辛店、丰台各铁路职工暨北平邮政管理局、华北公路运输总局等四十余单位，为迎接中国共产党诞生日——“七一”二十八周年，正以无比的热情努力增产。北平等地铁路职工普遍自动加班二小时，定出迎接“七一”的增产计划。丰台机务段工人额外装修一台“丰台七一号”机车。工务段工人要额外作成两辆手摇车，道班工人制定了养路计划。电务段北平电力工区计划在二十日内修好四九○五六号发电车，定为“人民号”。平津路局并决定从“七一”起全路实行新行车制。平保筑路处北河桥工段决定将北河大桥提前在“七一”通车。平津路局长辛店铁路段从工人、职员到工程师都互相挑起竞赛。电机厂的工友们在迎接“七一”的生产计划中写着：为使三百马力的死电机复活，决定于“七一”前完成一切准备工作，从六月五日自动加班检修本厂各天轴电动机。机车部为使六七二死机车复活，加紧配备该车电汽设备，修复破废的机车发电机二台。制表部自造试表器一部，新造卷线型电动器控制器五个（包括自制零件二千五百件）。锅炉检修部要争取修复一年多未用的电泵和井内水龙头，自动加班检修全场风管、水管、汽管，暖汽锅炉四台。制炉厂决定把四十五吨起重机一、二两台锅炉完成修复。修配厂修复起破的不能用的三十马力摩托车，同时赶修大铁调直机和两个离水泵，三个锅顶。北平机务段原来在国民党统治时期是车库，并不担负加减任务，解放后由于工人们的劳动热忱高涨，自觉的把车库变成了加减机务段。当工人们亲手创建“五一”号机车时，克服了一切设备不齐全的困难，将废物装修成能够长途行驶的新“五一”号。现在迎接“七一”，又以同样精神装修两部机车，“青年号”现在只缺一个弹簧了，另一部正在赶装中。工务段争取在业余时间完成一千个洋搞把，但缺乏木料，工人们便研究将城墙上边的干死树刨下来作为洋镐把的原料。检车段以修复十辆客车来迎接“七一”。北平电务段十多个单位均依据本单位的具体业务，制订了增产计划，作为“七一”献礼。西直门机务段要将日本统治时期ムㄞ号一台一五一六号的机车装修复活，没有加检的工具设备与原料，工人们自己研究了化铜炉，可做小型的接烟管，铜杆。没有加检地沟，则利用车库的加检沟，用旧的千斤顶进行修理。铜的来源，均是收集了废铜。工务段铁匠房的工人除将敌伪时代埋在地下废铁做成道钉一万八千个，一付新的道岔，七付旧的道岔外，西直门段全体职工并在积极建设一座大礼堂。
    北平邮政管理局所属各单位以造成学习运动来迎接“七一”，包裹处则拟完成万件包裹来迎接“七一”。
