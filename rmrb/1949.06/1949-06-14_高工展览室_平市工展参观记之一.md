High Vocational School Exhibition Hall
    ——One of the Tour Notes of the Ping City Industrial Exhibition
    Our Reporter Tian Liu
    Various products manufactured by the students of the Beiping Senior Industrial Vocational School are one of the shining exhibits in the Beiping City Industrial Exhibition after liberation. The "High Vocational School" (short for Senior Industrial Vocational School, same below) exhibition hall contains special significance. Each product displayed in it demonstrates the unification of mental and physical labor, and intellectuals are striving for an industrialized China.
    The exhibition here is divided into three parts: floor, table, and wall displays. The 17-inch vertical high-speed drilling machine, universal milling machine, bullhead planer, lathe, soap stamping machine, waterwheel, etc., standing on the floor, are of the greatest interest to visitors. Receptionist Xue Guangli told the reporter: These machines were all made by the students themselves during their internships. He explained in detail the relationship between the various machines and the blueprints and the drawing process. After all the blueprints are drawn under theoretical guidance, they must be verified and corrected by the students in the respective mechanical manufacturing process, and all the machines are manufactured under the guidance of precise blueprints.
    The exhibits on the table are of various kinds, including various styles of sprayers for killing agricultural pests, various tools necessary for industrial production, soft and glossy leather of various kinds, various colors of paint pigments, and dozens of organic and inorganic drugs. ...
    There is no doubt that these are all necessary for industrial and agricultural production. One visitor said: "In China, schools like this are really needed. I hope to bring what I have learned to every corner." -- This has more practical significance for the seventy or eighty students who are about to graduate during the summer vacation. Another visitor hoped to "make more agricultural tools to solve the difficulties in agricultural production," while the third visitor requested "struggle for China's industrialization." "Now is the time to develop everyone's talents. The motherland relies on us to build it. Students, let us struggle for the interests of the people!"

　　高工展览室
    ——平市工展参观记之一
    本报记者  田流
    北平市高级工业职业学校同学们制造的各种产品，在解放后的北平市工业展览会里是具有光彩的展览品之一，“高工”（高级工业职业学校简称，下同）展览室含着特殊的意义。它陈列着的每一件产品本身，都说明着脑力劳动和体力劳动的统一，知识分子正在为工业的中国努力。
    这里展览分地上、案上、墙上三部分陈列着，最引起参观者兴趣的是地上立着的十七英寸立式高速钻床、万能洗床和牛头刨床、旋床、肥皂压印机、水车等。招待员薛广礼语记者：这些机器，都是同学们在实习中自己双手制造的。他详细解释各种机器同蓝图的相互关系和绘制过程，所有的蓝图在理论指导之下绘好后，都要得到同学们在各该机械制造过程中去证明和修正，而全部的机器都是在精确的蓝图指导下制造出来的。
    案上的展览品是种类繁多的，有捕杀农作品虫害的各种样式的喷雾器，有工业生产中必需的各种工具，有柔软光泽的各种皮革，有各色的油漆颜料，有数十种有机药品和无机药品。……
    毫无疑问，这都是工业与农业生产所必需的。一位参观者说：“在中国，象这样的学校实在太需要了，希望能把学习到的带到每个角落。”——这对暑假就要毕业的七、八十位同学更有现实的意义。另一位参观者希望“多作些农具，解决农业生产的困难”，第三位参观者则要求“为中国工业化奋斗”，“现在是发展各个人才能的时候了，祖国依靠我们来建设，同学们，为人民的利益奋斗吧！”
