　　Handan City First Cooperative
  　Correct Policy Leads to Increased Shares
    [Our Dispatch] Since its establishment, the Handan City First Cooperative has been determined to serve its members and not to pursue profits as its goal. As a result, members have received many benefits, and their shares have greatly increased. The cooperative originally stipulated that each share cost five jin of rice, and members could buy forty-five jin of rice from the cooperative each month. Because the price was lower than that of state-owned stores, they could save ninety yuan in total; buying two jin of oil saved twenty yuan; one jin of salt saved five yuan, and one pack of matches and two bars of soap also saved five yuan each. It also saved time and was convenient. Members can freely withdraw shares, with in-kind guarantees of capital, so that members do not suffer losses. Because the cooperative provides these convenient conditions for its members, the masses have been eager to buy shares. Since May, seventy to eighty people have been joining every day. On the 13th, 134 shares were received in one day. The cooperative now has 1,502 shares.

　　邯郸市第一合作社
  　方针正确股份增多
    【本报讯】邯市第一合作社自成立以来，即确定为社员服务，不以营利为目的。因此社员获得了不少利益，股份大大增加。该社原规定每股五斤米，每月可从社里买到四十五斤米，因为价格比公营商店还低，共可省九十元；买油二斤，省二十元；一斤盐，省五元，一包火柴、两条肥皂亦各省五元。并且节省时间和方便。社员可自由抽股，实物保本，不使社员吃亏。由于该社给社员这些便利条件，群众纷纷要求入股。自五月份以来，每天均有七、八十人去入股，十三日一天即收了一百三十四股，现在该社已拥有一千五百零二股。
