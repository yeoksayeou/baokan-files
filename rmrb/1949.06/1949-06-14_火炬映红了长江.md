　　"Torches Illuminate the Yangtze River"
    Liu Baiyu
    On June 4th, the people of Wuhan, as if drunk and frenzied, plunged into the grand carnival celebrating the liberation of themselves as well as Shanghai, Hangzhou, Jiujiang, Nanchang, Xi'an, and Qingdao. A victory celebration attended by 200,000 people, a surging torrent of torchlight parades—in Hankou, more than 500,000 people participated, and in Wuchang, the procession stretched for fifteen miles—this was a demonstration of the people's mighty power. In these days of victory following victory, this was the first time I had seen such a fervently enthusiastic, joyful, and powerful mass scene. This city, located at the confluence of the Yangtze and Han rivers, right at the heart of China's north-south thoroughfare, this industrial center of central China, possesses a history that evokes yearning. The bloodstains of the "February 7th" massacre are forever etched in our memory. Now, on Mount Luojia, we can still pay homage to the tomb of martyr Shi Yang. Later, when the Great Revolution of 1927 rose up in a magnificent and vigorous manner, Wuhan was the torch held high in that storm. After Chiang Kai-shek's betrayal, this place became a sea of blood. Beneath the Yellow Crane Tower, I found the execution ground of that time, now overgrown with lush green grass. Today! History is not a relic of the past, but is unfolding with fresh, vibrant, and powerful force. The dockworkers of the Jianghan Customs, having received news of the gathering last night, worked through the night to take out their wages, buy red cloth, and sew large flags for the seamen. In the morning, young people ran everywhere with red flags. After noon, the processions heading to the meeting filled the main thoroughfares.

    In the spacious meeting place—the overcast skies had cleared, and sunlight streamed down—I mingled among the countless masses. As everyone looked up and surged toward the huge portrait of the leader, surrounded by eight red flags fluttering in the wind, I heard the workers burst out with such cheers: "Chairman Mao, Commander-in-Chief Zhu, they all came from here!"

    Mayor Wu Defeng, who was a Standing Committee member of the Wuhan Revolutionary Government in 1927, announced the opening of the meeting, and with boundless enthusiasm, he shouted to the assembly: "Twenty-two years ago, Chiang Kai-shek suppressed the revolution. We Communists swore: We must return! Today, we have returned!" A tidal wave of cheers erupted in the square. At that very moment, a beautiful rainbow appeared in the eastern sky. Several old workers from the "February 7th" era of the Pinghan Railway, who were attending the meeting, spoke of the great changes of the past twenty-two years. Lathe operator Gui Mingliang excitedly looked at his own hand, which had been injured and disabled in those years. He was old, but he spoke words of steel to a reporter: "My blood was not shed in vain. We will build more factories here." Wu Baisheng was so moved that he shed tears, saying, "In the past, we fought the enemy empty-handed. Today, we have so many troops!" This celebration of liberation was actually the triumph of the people. History proves that light will surely overcome darkness, but light can only be obtained through struggle.

    I remember that just eighteen days ago, when I entered Wuhan with the frontline headquarters, I saw with my own eyes the bridge at the entrance, burned by the Bai Chongxi bandit gang, still smoldering. Bai Chongxi flew from Guangzhou to Wuchang on the 14th, personally wanting to destroy Wuhan. At four o'clock in the afternoon on the 15th, the first explosion came from the river. The hearts of all the people of Wuhan were pained, and they watched as the flickering flames continued all night long. Bai Chongxi's plan of destruction was enormous, even including blowing up the dikes, but it met with the tremendous resistance of the people of Wuhan. Under the leadership of the secret organization of the Chinese Communist Party in Wuhan, this hidden but strong resistance movement began in March. The night of the 15th was the most tense night of the factory protection struggle. The thirty-mile stretch of the Yangtze River from Chenjiaji to Longwang Temple was shrouded in smoke. The enemy surrounded the Pinghan Railway Machinery Factory on the Jiang'an side, wanting to destroy the locomotives. However, the Pinghan Railway workers secretly buried 60% of the machine parts in the grass and ponds overnight, and the drivers took advantage of the night to drive the locomotives out one by one to evacuate and hide them. Wang Dacong, the foreman of the locomotive shed, had not closed his eyes for three days and nights, and that night he risked crossing the enemy's cordon to snatch six locomotives, until he fell ill. The struggle on the Yangtze River was even more intense. The sailors on the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's "Flying Tiger" traveled back and forth on the river, towing several ships to the far-off Xianyu Tao to hide them. One ship that could not escape had already been set ablaze. A sailor rushed up and carried out the equipment from the ship. Many boatmen on the Xiang River gritted their teeth, preferring to sink their wooden boats to the bottom of the river rather than let Bai Chongxi drag them away. The Telecommunications Bureau, cotton mills, water and electricity plants… all were preserved through the heroic struggle of the working class. The terrible night passed, and on the 16th, dawn broke! Wuhan was resurrected from the flames! Today, isn't this cheering of the sea of people a loud answer to the war criminals' cruel destruction?

    I heard Deputy Director Tao of the Military Control Commission, Secretary Zhang Pinghua of the Municipal Party Committee, and every worker and student representative loudly shouting the same voice: "Strive for production and build a new industrial Wuhan." Wuhan once had more than 900 factories, but before liberation, only more than 30 continued to operate. To transform this dilapidated, withered city into a prosperous and vibrant new city—the people of Wuhan are filled with confidence. Among the workers, I found them flashing this lofty enthusiasm. On the "Hankou" steamship, seaman Wan Yuanlin, who had once held the large flag at the front of the seamen's demonstration procession during the Great Revolution, was carefully painting the burnt black planks with bright red paint, saying, "For more than 20 years, I have touched it and watched it grow up. Now I want it to be revived stronger." Yes, China, which was destroyed by the enemy, is being reborn in our hands in this way!

    When darkness fell, tens of millions of torches lit up all at once. The sky over the three towns was dyed red by the light of victory. Hundreds of trucks were decorated with huge portraits of Chairman Mao, Commander-in-Chief Zhu De, and General Lin Biao. Various neon lights and illumination lights shone on the four red flags at the front of the parade. The people of Wuhan turned into a狂热洪流 (frenetic torrent) that overflowed. The streets, windows, and roofs were full of people. Everything was moving, and the cheers and songs were indistinguishable. From eight o'clock to twelve o'clock in the night, the entire Wuhan only heard a huge roar, like the thunder of a spring night. Torches, torches… illuminating the road where the blood of the revolutionary people once flowed. Mayor Wu told reporters: There was a grand gathering in 1927 to celebrate the Fifth National Labor Congress. At that time, Comrade Liu Shaoqi, one of the leaders of the Chinese Communist Party, was here. He was the leader of the workers' movement at that time. At that historic meeting, French Communist leader Dorio also delivered a speech. Today, these heroic and glorious days have returned. But only today, under the leadership of Chairman Mao, when the vast land of the motherland from Heilongjiang to south of the Yangtze River has become a people's land with boundless brilliance, this jubilation, this enthusiasm, is different from any historical period.

    When the clear chimes of the Jianghan Customs came from the darkness, I knew that this was the chime of history. The torches everywhere were winding into a long band, making the vast Yangtze River glow all over. In the red light, countless enthusiastic and determined people were marching forward—this is the new historical era of the Chinese people in progress.

　　“火炬映红了长江”
    刘白羽
    六月四日，武汉人民如醉如狂地卷入庆祝自己以及上海、杭州、九江、南昌、西安、青岛的解放的大狂欢中。二十万人的庆祝胜利大会，汹涌的火炬游行的巨流——在汉口，有五十万以上的人参加，在武昌，游行行列绵延了十五里——这是人民强大力量的示威。在胜利紧接着胜利的这些日子里，我是第一次看到这样热狂、愉快、有力的群众场面。这座地处江汉交汇、正当中国南北要冲的城市，这个华中的工业中心，有着使人向往的历史。“二七”血迹永远深印我们记忆之中。现在在珞珈山上，我们还可以瞻仰到施洋烈士的坟墓。后来，一九二七年大革命轰轰烈烈上升时，武汉是那狂风暴雨中高举的火把。当蒋介石叛变后，这儿成为大的血泊。我在黄鹤楼下找到当时的杀人场，今天已长满萋萋青草。今天！历史并非陈迹，而是带着新鲜活跃的强大力量展现了。江汉关的海员工人，是昨晚得到集会消息的，他们连夜掏出工资买红布，缝制海员的大旗。早晨，青年们手持红旗各处奔跑。中午一过，赴会的行列便塞满通衢大道。
    在宽阔的会场上，——阴雨收晴，阳光四射，我杂在无数群众队伍中。当大家仰首拥向那给飞舞着的八面红旗拥簇着的巨大领袖画像时，我听见工人们爆发出这样的欢声：“毛主席，朱总司令，都是从咱们这里出去的啊！”
    吴德峰市长，这位一九二七年武汉市革命政府的常务委员，在宣布开会时，满怀着无限的热情向大会高呼：“二十二年前，蒋介石把革命镇压。我们共产党人曾宣誓：我们一定要回来的！今天，我们回来了！”广场上爆发了海涛般的欢呼。恰恰这时，东面天空出现了一条美丽的彩虹。参加大会的几个“二七”时代的平汉路老工人，道出了这二十二年的大变化。旋床工人桂明亮兴奋地看着他自己当年受伤残废的手。他老了，可是他对一个记者说出钢铁的语句：“我的血没有白流。我们要在这里建设更多的工厂。”吴柏生感动得流着泪说：“从前我们手无寸铁跟敌人作战，今天有了这样多的队伍！”这一个庆祝解放的大会，实际就是人民的凯旋，历史证明光明必定战胜黑暗，但光明只有从斗争中得来。
    我记得仅仅在十八天以前，我随前线指挥部进入武汉时，亲眼看见入口处被白崇禧匪帮烧毁的桥梁还冒着浓烟。白崇禧十四日由广州飞回武昌，亲手要毁灭武汉。十五日下午四点钟，第一声爆炸声从江面上传来。全武汉人民的心都被震痛了，他们眼看着一闪一闪的火光继续了整整一夜。白崇禧的毁灭计划是庞大的，甚至包括炸崩堤岸，可是它遭到了武汉人民的巨大反抗。在中国共产党武汉秘密组织领导下，这一隐秘的但却是强烈的反抗运动从三月里就开始了。十五日晚上是最紧张的护厂斗争的一夜。由谌家矶到龙王庙的三十里江面为硝焰笼罩着。敌人包围了江岸平汉路机厂，要炸毁机车。可是平汉路工人连夜秘密埋藏了百分之六十的机器零件到草丛和水塘里，司机们趁着深夜把机车一辆辆开出去疏散隐蔽。机车房监工王达聪已经三天三夜没合过眼了，那一夜又冒险穿过敌兵警戒线，抢出六辆机车，直到病倒下来。长江上的斗争更是紧张。招商局“飞虎”号上的水手们，在江上来往奔驶，把几只轮船拖到远远的鲜鱼套去隐藏起来。一只来不及逃避的船，已经被焚烧起火了。一个海员冲上去还抱出船上的器材。襄河上的许多船工，则咬紧牙关，宁愿把自己的木船击沉江底，也不给白崇禧拖走。电信局、纱厂、水电厂，……都在工人阶级的英勇斗争中被保全下来了。可怕的一夜度了过去，十六日，天亮了！武汉从火焰中复活了！今天这一个人海的欢呼，不正是对战争罪犯们的残酷破坏的响亮回答吗？
    我听到军管会陶副主任、市委书记张平化同志和每个工人、学生群众代表都响亮地喊着同一的声音：“努力生产，建设一个工业的新武汉。”武汉曾经有过九百多家工厂，可是在解放前只有三十余家继续开工。把这个破烂、枯干了的城市变成一个繁荣活跃的新城市——武汉人民充满着信心。我在工人群众中发现他们正在闪烁着这种崇高的热情。在“汉口”号火轮上，海员工人万元林，这个在大革命时代的海员示威行列前面曾经撑过大旗的人，他一面细心用鲜红油漆涂着被烧得乌黑的船板，一面说：“二十多年来我手摸着它长大，现在我要它复活得更强壮了。”是的，被敌人毁坏了的中国，就是这样地在我们的手里新生的！
    当黑夜降临时，成千万的火炬一下子亮了起来。三镇的天空为胜利的火光染红了。成百辆的卡车装饰着毛主席、朱总司令、林彪将军的巨像。各色霓虹灯、照明灯辉耀着游行行列最前面的四面红旗。武汉人民变成狂热洪流泛滥开来了。街上、窗上、屋顶上全是人，一切都在动，欢呼声、歌声是分不清的。从八点钟到深夜十二点钟，整个武汉只听见一种巨大轰响，有如春天深夜的雷鸣。火炬、火炬……照亮了从前流过革命人民鲜血的路。吴市长对记者说：一九二七年有过一次盛大的庆祝全国第五次劳动大会的集会，那时中国共产党领导者之一刘少奇同志就在这里，他是当时工人运动的领导者。在那次有历史意义的大会上，法国共产党领袖多烈士还发表了讲演。今天这英雄、光耀的日月回来了。可是只有今天，在毛主席领导下，从黑龙江到长江以南，辽阔的祖国土地都变成了光芒万丈的人民国土时，这欢腾，这热烈，才是不同于任何历史时期的。
    当江汉关的清澈的钟声从黑夜中传来时，我知道，这是历史的钟声。各处的火炬正蜿蜒成一条长带，把浩瀚长江映成一片通红。在红光中，无数热狂而坚毅的人正在前进着——这是中国人民新的历史时代在行进。
