　　Establish Wheat Purchasing and Flour Sales Committee to Conduct Unified Purchase of New Wheat in Wheat Producing Areas
    [Report from this newspaper] As the new wheat season approaches, the Wheat Purchasing and Flour Sales Committee, jointly established by the Tianjin Grain Company and the Flour Industry Association, is planning to purchase wheat locally or in wheat producing areas outside the city. In order to encourage grain wholesalers in the city to cooperate with the purchase to expand wheat sources, the Municipal Bureau of Industry and Commerce convened a symposium for grain wholesalers and members of the Wheat Purchasing and Flour Sales Committee at the Yarn Fabric Industry Association at 1 Hebei Road at 9:00 AM on the 6th. Fifty-nine grain wholesalers and twenty-four flour manufacturers (members of the Wheat Purchasing and Flour Sales Committee) attended the meeting. The person in charge of the Bureau of Industry and Commerce spoke at the meeting, calling on grain wholesalers to organize themselves in the future and engage in grain transportation and sales in an organized and planned manner, and to closely integrate with the flour production sector to achieve consistency between supply and demand, so as to resolve the past contradictions between manufacturers and distributors. On the current issue of jointly cooperating to purchase wheat, the government should provide possible assistance and try to solve the difficulties in purchasing and transportation. All the merchants present expressed their approval. The grain wholesalers decided to hold another meeting in the afternoon to discuss the measures and submit them to the Bureau of Industry and Commerce. The Bureau of Industry and Commerce will convene another meeting after reviewing the opinions of the grain wholesalers to discuss specific measures for cooperating in wheat purchasing.
