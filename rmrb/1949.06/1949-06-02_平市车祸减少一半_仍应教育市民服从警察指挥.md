　　Vehicle Accidents in Beiping Reduced by Half
  　Citizens Should Still be Educated to Obey Police Instructions
    [Our Newspaper] As a result of repeated reports by this newspaper and multiple discussions convened by the Beiping Public Security Bureau with relevant agencies and organizations, vendors obstructing traffic order have been reorganized, and drivers involved in accidents have been educated. In the twenty days from May 10th to May 30th, vehicle accidents in Beiping have been reduced by half. Only seventeen accidents occurred (the number of vehicle accidents in the first ten days of May was also seventeen). Among them, only one accident was caused by driver carelessness. Currently, the main cause of accidents is the carelessness of both parties, with cars, trams, pedicabs, handcarts, animal-drawn carts, and bicycles either yielding to each other or competing with each other. Many accidents are caused by pedicabs and bicycles not following traffic rules, traveling in the fast lane in the middle of the road, not taking large detours, and disobeying the traffic police's instructions. Therefore, it is urgent to educate them on traffic order. (Traces)

　　平市车祸减少一半
  　仍应教育市民服从警察指挥
    【本报讯】经本报一再反映及平市公安局多次邀集有关机关团体商讨，整理有碍交通秩序的摊贩，对肇事司机进行教育，从五月十日起至三十日止的二十天中，平市车祸已减少一半。只发生十七起（五月上旬十日车祸亦为十七起）。其中因司机不慎而引起车祸者仅一次。目前车祸发生的主要原因，是双方不慎，汽车、电车、三轮车、排子车、兽力车、自行车等互让或互争而发生车祸。其中多以三轮车、自行车不按交通规则，行走马路中间的快车道，不走大迂回，不听交通警的指挥等肇事。故亟应对其进行交通秩序之教育。（迹）
