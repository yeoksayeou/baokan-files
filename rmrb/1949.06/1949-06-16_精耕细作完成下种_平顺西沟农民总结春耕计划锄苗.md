(Taihang News) After the planting in Xigou Village, Second District of Pingshun, was completed, in order to promote the weeding movement and ensure the realization of the production increase plan, a mass meeting of the whole village was held on May 29 to summarize the planting achievements and elect heroes and models. This year, the masses' production enthusiasm surpassed any previous year. Coupled with the active leadership and promotion of Branch Secretary Li Shunda and all party members and cadres, the village has successfully completed the planting plan, and other plans such as manure accumulation, cultivation, and tree planting have also been successfully completed. After the county party congress, Shunda immediately convened a family meeting to formulate an annual production increase plan and a short-term living plan. He also led his group to formulate annual and short-term plans. In terms of spring ploughing and planting, Shunda saw that the weather was early, so he called on the masses to seize the opportunity to plant, and put forward the slogan of "planting as you plough and spot planting with manure," which enabled the whole village to finish planting ahead of schedule, and all the seedlings emerged. In terms of cultivation, most of the 191 mu of grain fields in the village were ploughed three times and harrowed twice. The original plan was to apply 90 loads of manure per mu, but the average application was 97 loads per mu. All 205 mu of corn fields were ploughed and harrowed twice, and most were harrowed once, and the fertilizer application per mu also exceeded the original plan by 15 loads. Technical guidance was universally implemented in planting. All grain fields were planted with two-legged drills, and crop rotation, seed exchange, seed soaking, and seed selection were popularized among all households, laying the foundation for this year's production increase. The main reason for these achievements is the correct leadership of party member cadres, who go deep into the mutual aid groups to lead production and motivate everyone with their exemplary actions. The second is the voluntary combination of the masses to change work and help each other, using flexible methods of concentrating on major tasks and dispersing minor tasks. For example, major tasks such as carrying fertilizer, building embankments, and planting are concentrated, while general tasks are separated. As a result of the evaluation, Li Shunda, Guo Yuzhi, and Fang Qiuze were elected as models. That night, the branch committee discussed the short-term plan before weeding based on the situation of the whole village, and mobilized all party members to go deep into the masses to formulate the production plans for each household.

　　精耕细作完成下种
  　平顺西沟农民总结春耕计划锄苗
    【太行讯】平顺二区西沟村下种结束后，为了推动锄苗运动，保证增产计划实现，于五月二十九日召开全村群众大会，总结下种成绩，评选英雄模范。今年群众的生产情绪超过任何一年，加上支书李顺达和全体党员干部的积极带头推动，全村已胜利完成下种计划，其他积肥、耕作、植树等计划也都顺利完成。全县党代会后，顺达立即召开家庭会议，制定全年增产计划和短期生活计划。并领导他组也都订下了全年的和短期的计划。在春耕下种方面，顺达看见天有早象，便号召群众抢垧下种，提出“随犁随种与担圊点种”的口号，使全村下种提前结束，小苗全部出土。在耕作方面，全村一百九十一亩谷田，大部犁三遍耙耢二遍，原计划每亩上粪九十担，结果平均每亩上九十七担。玉茭地二百零五亩，全部犁耢二遍，大部耙一遍，每亩上肥也超过原计划十五担。在下种中普遍贯彻了技术指导，谷田全用两条腿耧播种，调茬换种浸种漂种普及全村各户，为今年的增产打下基础。这些成绩的获得，主要是由于党员干部领导正确，深入互助组带头生产，以自己的模范行动带动大家。其次是群众自愿结合变工互助，运用了大活集中小活分散的灵活方式，如担肥垒岸下种等大活就集中作，一般的就分开。评选结果，李顺达、郭玉枝、房秋则三人当选模范，当夜支委会又根据全村情况讨论出锄苗前的短期计划，发动全体党员深入群众订定各户的生产计划。
