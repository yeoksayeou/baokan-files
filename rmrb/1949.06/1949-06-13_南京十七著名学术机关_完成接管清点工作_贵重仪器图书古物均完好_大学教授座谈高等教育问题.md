Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, 12th. The Nanjing Military Control Commission's takeover of seventeen prominent academic institutions in Nanjing formerly under the Kuomintang government, with the active assistance of all staff members, has completed the inventory and preliminary sorting work. These seventeen academic institutions are the Academia Sinica, the Central Library, the Institute of Geography of China, the Frontier Culture and Education Hall, the Founding Documents Museum, the Nanjing Branch of the Beiping Library, the Jiangsu Provincial Library, the Central Animal Husbandry Experiment Station, the Central Agricultural Experiment Station, the Agricultural and Forestry Experiment Station, the Cotton Improvement Institute, the Institute of Agricultural Economics, the Farmland Water Conservancy Engineering Office, the Mineral Surveying and Prospecting Office, the Meteorological Bureau, the National History Museum, and the Compilation and Education Museum. Thanks to the active assistance of all staff members in each unit, the inventory work was extremely smooth, and a large number of valuable instruments, books, specimens, antiques, etc., were preserved intact. The units that have completed the inventory are now launching a study movement. Everyone hopes to transform themselves through study and make academia serve the people and production and construction.
Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, 12th. The Cultural and Educational Takeover Committee of the People's Liberation Army Nanjing Military Control Commission and the Nanjing Municipal People's Government Education Bureau held a tea party at the Overseas Chinese Guest House at 1:00 PM on the 4th of this month, inviting professors from universities and colleges in Nanjing to exchange views on higher education issues. Attendees included Xu Pingyu, Director of the Cultural and Educational Takeover Committee, Deputy Directors Ren Chonggao and Wang Minyuan, and over 170 professors from colleges and universities such as Liang Xi, Wu Yifang, Liu Kairong, and Wu Zuxiang. The professors spoke enthusiastically, unanimously pointing out that education under the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang was divorced from the people, violated the interests of the people, and disconnected theory from practice. The professors also expressed many opinions on reforming the education system. Professor Liang Xi pointed out that past education served the big bourgeoisie. Professor Hu Shanqian believed that past education was to create a scholar-official class. He said, "From elementary school to university, to studying abroad, the purpose was to seek a path to promotion and wealth, which had nothing to do with the people's revolutionary cause." Professor Sun Jia＠ believed that past education was not only divorced from the people but also from the students. Professor Jin Baoshan pointed out that those who studied agriculture did not recognize crops when they went to the countryside; Professor Cheng Shi pointed out that those who studied engineering rarely or never went to factories for internships. Professors Li Peilin, Jin Baoshan, Wu Xiang, and Gao Xueqin all proposed contributing academics to the people, opposing selfishness, and breaking down sectarianism. Professor Li Peilin said, "Culture comes from the people and should return to the people." He believed that things that are beneficial to the people should be worked hard to do. Professor Chen Zhang believed that unnecessary universities and colleges should be merged according to the needs of the country, and reactionary aristocratic schools run by bureaucrats and wealthy families should be transformed or banned. Professor Ouyang Zhu hoped to learn from the Soviet Union and establish more research institutes. Professors Zhou Huiming and Fan Qianzhong pointed out that research should be combined with production and that research results should be extended to factories and rural areas. The professors also provided many specific suggestions for the reform of the academic system and curriculum content.

    大学教授座谈高等教育问题
    【新华社南京十二日电】南京军管会所接管的南京市前国民党政府所辖的十七个著名的学术机关，在全体员工的积极协助下，已完成了清点及初步整理工作。这十七个学术机关是中央研究院、中央图书馆、中国地理研究所、边疆文化教育馆、开国文献馆、北平图书馆南京分馆、江苏省图书馆、中央畜牧实验所、中央农业实验所、农林实验所、棉产改进所、农业经济研究所、农田水利工程处、矿产测勘处、气象局、国史馆、编教馆。由于各个单位全体员工积极协助，清点工作极为顺利，大批贵重仪器、图书、标本、古物等得以完好保存。现清点完毕的各单位正展开学习运动。大家都希望在学习中改造自己，使学术为人民大众与生产建设服务。
    【新华社南京十二日电】人民解放军南京市军管会文教接管委员会及南京市人民政府教育局，于本月四日下午一时假华侨招待所举行茶会，邀请南京各大学和专科学校教授，就高等教育问题交换意见。出席者有文教接管委员会徐平羽主任，任崇高、王敏远副主任及各专科以上学校教授梁希、吴贻芳、刘开荣、吴组湘等一百七十余人。各教授发言极为踊跃，一致指出：国民党反动统治下的教育脱离人民，违反人民利益，理论与实践脱节。各教授并对改革教育制度发表很多意见。梁希教授指出过去的教育是为大资产阶级服务的。胡善乾教授认为过去的教育是造就士大夫阶级的教育，他说：“从小学而大学，而留洋，其目的乃是求得升官发财的门径，和人民的革命事业是没有什么关连的。”孙家＠教授认为过去的教育不但脱离了人民，而且脱离学生。金宝善教授指出学农业的到了农村里却不认识农作物；程式教授指出过去学工程的却很少或者根本不到工厂里去实习。李佩琳、金宝善、吴襄、高学勤诸教授都提出把学术贡献给人民，反对自私自利，打破宗派主义的意见。李佩琳教授说：“文化来自人民，应该回到人民中去。”他认为对人民有利的事就应该努力去作。陈章教授认为应当根据国家的需要，把不必要的大、专学校加以合并，那些由官僚与豪门主办的反动的贵族学校则应予以改造或取缔。欧阳翥教授希望学习苏联，多多设立研究所。周慧明、范谦衷两教授指出研究应与生产结合，把研究所得推广到工厂中去，到农村中去。对于学制和课程内容的改革，各教授也都提供了很多具体意见。
