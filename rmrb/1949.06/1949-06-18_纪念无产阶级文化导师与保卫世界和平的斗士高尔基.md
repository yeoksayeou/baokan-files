　　In Memory of Gorky, the Mentor of Proletarian Culture and Fighter for World Peace
    Hu Jibang
    I. Efforts to Build a New Culture
    After the October Revolution, Gorky carried out extensive educational work among young writers. Veterans returning from the front lines and new writers growing up in factories, whose knowledge and experience were limited, received his assistance as much as possible. He founded "World Literature" to translate world classics to expand the knowledge of young writers and readers, and published a large number of popular reading materials, printing small booklets of stories for ten kopecks each. To promote young writers and writers from various ethnic groups, he published "Collections of Proletarian Writers" and "Collections of Writers from Various Ethnic Groups."
    Gorky was also very concerned about the living problems of general scholars and writers. He organized a committee to improve the lives of scholars. Gorky once said with great sympathy: "I saw scholars suffering from hunger and cold between 1919 and 1920, and they endured all this heroically."
    In 1921, Gorky fell ill. At that time, the domestic treatment conditions were still very poor, so he went to Italy for recuperation. Gorky lived in Italy from 1921 to 1928, completing several great works.
    In 1928, the first year of the implementation of the first five-year plan, Gorky returned to the Soviet Union from Italy amidst the enthusiastic expectations of the people across the country. He went to major cities to investigate his long-separated motherland and witnessed the vigorous development of production and the progress of the lives of the emerging working class everywhere. In 1929, he traveled across the country again to visit the rural construction in various places. He wrote "Sketches of the Soviet Federation," repeatedly praising the ten years of Soviet construction as a miracle!
    Since 1928, Gorky enthusiastically participated in the agricultural collectivization movement that was unfolding at that time, giving speeches and visiting state-owned farms and collective farms, and visiting children's labor reform camps. He was moved to see these former homeless children working in the fields. Gorky himself understood the emotions of vagrants very well. He had criticized the shortcomings of such people, such as their aversion to labor. Now, using a collective life and collective labor education method to transform them, Gorky greatly praised the achievements of this children's camp and strongly encouraged the education director of the camp, Makarenko, to write his experience into a book. Later, he fulfilled Gorky's advice and wrote "The Epic of Education," which became one of the famous works of Soviet literature.
    Gorky described the dark life of peasants in old Russia. Now, seeing new intellectuals growing up in the countryside: agricultural experts, technicians, doctors, teachers, and writers, etc., made him very happy.
    In 1929, he founded the magazine "Collective Farm Member" for the new farmers and served as its editor himself. He personally wrote articles telling many stories about the dark life of farmers during the Tsarist era, so that farmers had a clear contrast between the old and the new.
    In the same year, he also founded the journals "Our Achievements" and "Ordinary People and Great Work." In 1931, Gorky's collection of essays was published, the main content of which was criticism of the old intellectuals.
    On Gorky's proposal, the publication of the "Factory History" series was organized, with himself as the editor. Based on the oral accounts of old workers, he wrote the history of each factory in fluent writing, so that workers had a deep comparison between the old and the new life.
    Gorky often emphasized that the new generation of citizens must deeply know the old life of the past, then they will give a higher evaluation and cherish the new achievements.
    In addition, he also founded magazines such as "The Soviet Union Under Construction," "Abroad," and "Literary Study." The latter was a special reading material for assisting young writers in self-study. Gorky used this publication to educate young people on how to learn to write, and personally revised their works and gave valuable instructions.
    Due to Gorky's initiative, the Children's Book Publishing Bureau was organized in 1932. Gorky personally wrote letters to children, soliciting their opinions, asking them what they usually read and what publications they hoped for in the future. The children responded enthusiastically and received more than two thousand letters from children. Gorky compiled the opinions contributed by the children and reported them to the Writers Association to determine the direction of children's publishing work in the future.
    Due to Gorky's proposal, historians from the country were invited to collectively write the history of the civil war. He himself also served as one of the editors. He said: "The history of the civil war is the history of the victory of the great truth embodied by the working class. The people should know their own history."
    Gorky embraced such enthusiasm for the construction of a new culture. Regardless of his own health, he personally participated in the editing work of various important publishing bureaus and books and periodicals, organizing and supporting them. At that time, according to statistics in 1930, Gorky directly participated in the editing and writing of 16 publications. The famous Soviet painter Kukryniksy made a cartoon about Gorky: holding two large piles of books, newspapers, and magazines in both hands, striding forward with his chest out. This is a portrayal of Gorky's life at that time.
    In addition to his constant personal creation, Gorky also shouldered the huge responsibility of leading the literature of the entire Soviet Union and was elected as the first chairman of the Writers Association in 1932.
    In 1934, the All-Soviet Writers Congress was held in Moscow, attended by representative writers from 53 ethnic groups and writers representatives from 40 countries. Zhdanov said in his report at this congress: "Gorky's assistance and contribution to the struggle of the Party and the proletariat to improve the quality of literature and cultural language is inestimable."
    II. Criticism of American and Western European Culture
    After Gorky participated in the failure of the armed uprising in December 1905, the Russian revolution receded to a low ebb. At that time, in order to avoid the persecution of the Tsar's executioners, he had to travel in exile and also planned to raise donations for the Party. He went to the United States in 1906. However, the American response to donations for the Russian revolution was not enthusiastic. Gorky was quite disappointed with the United States, especially with the society of New York. In his comments on the United States, there was an article entitled "The City of the Yellow Devil," calling New York the city of the demon of mammonism, where everything was for money, a soulless and boring society, a contradictory society of huge production and large-scale unemployment, and a society of national discrimination and abuse of black people.
    In 1928, an American magazine inquired Gorky whether his evaluation of American culture still maintained the opinion of 1906. Gorky still expressed his negation of American culture. He said: "Those you call American culture cannot arouse my sympathy. I think your culture is the ugliest culture on our planet, because it horribly exaggerates all the shameful ugliness of European culture."
    Gorky's criticism of Western European culture at the First National Writers Congress said:
    "Their culture is the school telling lies, the party telling lies, the parliament telling lies, and the publishing industry also telling lies; their culture is the police who have the power to whip and kill workers."
    This kind of police culture is even more exposed in the United States today. Aren't the spokespersons of the American publishing industry and parliament advocating humanism and national equality? But their discrimination and abuse against people of color exceeds any European country. Aren't American spokespersons talking about democracy and freedom? And what the Political Investigation Bureau has done, the harm to pure and good citizens, the deprivation of the basic rights of the working class, which aspect is not more absurd than European countries!
    A satirical painting of electrocution in front of the Statue of Liberty can fully represent the lying culture of the United States.
    III. Fighting for Anti-Fascism, and Dying for Fighting.
    Since Hitler came to power, Gorky exposed the true face of the fascist aggressors before all mankind in the capacity of world judge for the fascist destruction of culture, racial hatred, violation of human rights, and instigation of war conspiracies. He said: "The emergence of fascism is a manifestation of the weakness of the bourgeoisie, indicating that it cannot rule by ordinary democratic means." He also said: "Fascists are worse than beasts, an incomparable thing, many times worse than beasts. They are irrational livestock, animals that should be destroyed."
    The wise words of the great prophet were all confirmed in the Soviet Union's Patriotic War. The author witnessed too many atrocities of the Fascist Party on the Soviet front and in the recovered occupied areas, which are truly indescribable in human language!
    The great humanitarian Gorky, more than ten years ago, foresaw the threat to human survival and raised the banner of anti-war to the people of the world: "Destroy the enemy if he does not surrender!" Because the Soviet people thoroughly recognized the essence of fascism and earnestly implemented Gorky's battle call, fighting the fascist demons with their own flesh and blood, they were able to save all mankind from danger.
    In June 1935, due to Gorky's call, the International Writers Congress for the Defense of Culture was held in Paris, uniting progressive writers from all over the world under the banner of anti-war, and reaching a consensus with the world's best cultural representatives such as Romain Rolland and Barbusse to expose the conspiracies of war-mongers.
    In May 1949, the fourth year after the duel with the Fascists, the World Peace Congresses of Paris and Prague were convened again. This historical comparison will arouse people's deep memories!
    Gorky, this great cultural mentor and extraordinary revolutionary fighter, was killed by the enemy. Seeing that Gorky's appeal to the world was growing day by day, the counter-revolutionaries bought doctors to kill his dearest son first. Two years later, Gorky fell ill, and the doctor gave him a dose of medicine fourteen times higher than normal, causing Gorky to die of heart disease.
    Today, the people of the world who have been liberated from the iron claws of fascism, especially the people of the new democratic countries, commemorate this great pioneer—Gorky, with indescribable admiration and excitement!

　　纪念无产阶级文化导师与保卫世界和平的斗士高尔基
    胡济邦
    一、为建设新文化而努力
    十月革命以后，高尔基在青年作家群中进行了广大的教育工作，从前线回来的战士，在工厂里长成的新作家，他们知识经验都有限，高氏予以尽可能的协助，创办“世界文学”，翻译世界名著以展开青年作家与读者的知识境界，并发行大量群众读物，印刷十戈比一小册的故事。为提拔青年作家与各民族作家，曾发行“无产阶级作家集”与“各民族作家集”。
    高尔基也极关心一般学者和作家们的生活问题，组织改善学者生活委员会，高氏曾极同情地说：“我眼看到学者们在一九一九—一九二○年间挨受饥寒交迫的痛苦，而且英勇地忍受这一切。”
    一九二一年高尔基病倒了，那时国内治疗条件尚甚恶劣，他再往意大利疗养，高尔基自一九二一年至一九二八年都在意大利居住，完成若干伟大著作。
    一九二八年为第一个五年计划实施的第一年，高尔基在全国人民的热烈盼望中从意大利回到苏联。他曾往各大城市去考察这久别的祖国，目见各地生产的蓬勃发展和新兴工人阶级生活的进步。一九二九年他再旅行全国，参观各地的农村建设，他写了“苏维埃联邦速写”，他对于苏维埃的十年建设，一再赞为奇迹！
    高尔基自从一九二八年起就热烈参加当时展开的农业集体化运动，到国营农场，集体农庄去讲演，参观儿童劳动感化营，他看见这些过去的流浪儿童在田野里从事劳作而受感动。高氏本人对于流浪者的心绪是很理解的，他曾批评过这种人的缺陷，不好劳动。现在用一种集体生活，集体劳动的教育方法来改造他们，高尔基非常夸奖这个儿童营的成就，极力鼓励该营的教育主任马加林科，将他的经验写成一书，后来他履行高尔基的劝告写成“教育的史诗”，成为苏联文学名著之一。
    高尔基描写过旧俄农民生活的黑暗生活，现在眼见农村中已生长出新的知识分子：农业专家，技术人员、医生、教师及作家等等使他非常欣喜。
    一九二九年为新农民创办“集体农庄庄员”杂志，自己担任编辑。亲自撰稿讲述许多关于沙皇时代农民黑暗生活的故事，使农民对于旧的和新的有一个鲜明的对照。
    同年又创办“我们的成就”，“平凡的人和伟大的工作”等期刊。一九三一年出版高尔基论文集，主要内容为对旧知识分子的批评。
    由高尔基的提议组织出版“工厂历史”丛书，自己任编辑，根据老工人的口头叙述，以流利的文笔为各个工厂写出自己的历史，使工人对于旧的和新的生活有了深刻的比较。
    高尔基常常强调地说，必须使新的一代公民深切知道过去的旧生活，那么他才会对新的成就，予以更高的评价与珍惜。
    此外还创办了“建设中的苏联”、“国外”、“文艺学习”等杂志，后者专为协助青年作家自修的读物，高氏借此刊物教育青年如何学习写作，并且亲自为他们修改作品，给以宝贵的指示。
    由于高尔基的发起，一九三二年组织儿童书籍出版局，高氏亲自写信给儿童，征求他们的意见，问他们平时的读物和今后希望些什么刊物，儿童们报以热烈的响应，接到了二千多封儿童的回信。高尔基曾将儿童们贡献的意见汇集起来，提到作家协会上报告，以决定此后儿童出版工作的方针。
    由于高尔基的提议邀集了国内史学家们集体写著内战史，他本人也担任编辑之一，他说：“内战史是劳动阶级化身的伟大真理胜利的历史，人民应该知道自己的历史”。
    高尔基对于新文化的建设是抱着如此的热诚，他不顾自己的健康，对于各个重要出版局与书刊的编辑工作都亲自参加，把它组织和扶植起来，那时，据一九三○年的统计，高尔基直接参加编辑和写稿的刊物共有十六种。苏联名画家库克立尼克斯作过一张关于高尔基的漫画：左右两手分抱两大堆书报和杂志挺着胸迈步前进，这是当时高尔基生活的一幅写照。
    高尔基除了个人的不断创作，并且担负领导全苏联文学的巨大责任，一九三二年被选为第一任作家协会主席。
    一九三四年在莫斯科举行全苏联作家大会，参加的有五十三种民族的代表作家，和四十个国家的作家代表，日丹诺夫在这个大会上的报告中说：“高尔基对于党与无产阶级为提高文学品质与文化语言之斗争中，他的协助和贡献是无法估价的。”
    二、对于美国和西欧文化的批判
    高尔基自从参加一九○五年十二月的武装起义失败后，俄国革命退到低潮，当时为躲避沙皇侩子手的残害，不得不作亡命之游，同时也打算为党进行募捐，曾于一九○六年前往美国。但美国方面对于俄国革命捐款的响应并不热心，高尔基对于美国颇为失望，尤其对于纽约的社会特别反感。在他对美国的评论中有一篇题为“黄鬼城”，称纽约为拜金主义的魔鬼之城，一切都是为了金钱，一个没有灵魂的乏味社会，巨大生产与广大失业的矛盾社会，是民族歧视、虐待黑人的社会。
    一九二八年美国杂志社函询高尔基、对于美国文化的评价是否仍保持一九○六年的意见，高氏对于美国的文化依然表示否定，他说：“那些你们名为美国的文化不能激起我的同情，我以为你们的文化，是我们行星中最丑恶的文化，因为它把欧洲文化的各种可耻的丑恶加以可怕的夸大了”。
    高氏在第一届全国作家大会上对西欧文化的批评说：
    “他们的文化是学校撒诳，教党撒诳，国会撒诳，出版界也撒诳；他们的文化是予有鞭打和杀害工人之权的警吏。”
    这种警察文化在今日的美国更是暴露无遗了，美国的出版界和议会的发言人都不是高倡人道主义和民族平等吗？但他们对待有色人种的歧视和虐待，超过任何欧洲国家。美国的发言人不是高谈民主和自由吗？而他们政治调查局所做的事，对于纯良公民的残害，对于工人阶级基本权利的剥夺，那一方面不比欧洲国家更荒唐！
    自由神前施用电刑的一幅讽刺画可以实足代表美国撒诳的文化。
    三、为反法西斯而战斗，也为战斗而死。
    自从希特勒登台以后，高尔基对于法西斯的摧残文化，仇视种族，残害人权与煽动战争的阴谋，他曾以世界审判官的身份在全世界人类之前揭露法西斯侵略者的真面目，他说：“法西斯主义之产生是资产阶级力量软弱的表现，说明它用普通民主方式不能统治下去了”。他又说：“法西斯党人比禽兽更坏，是一种不能比较的，坏过禽兽不知几多倍的东西，这是无理性的牲畜，应被毁灭的动物”。
    伟大预言家的至理明言，在这次苏联的祖国战争中一切都被证实了，笔者曾在苏联前线和收复的沦陷区目睹法西斯党人的暴行太多了，用人类的语言真是无法形容！
    伟大的人道主义者高尔基，在十余年前已预见人类生存之受威胁，向全世界人民高举反战的大旗“敌人不投降就消灭他”！由于苏联人民彻底认识法西斯的本质和切实执行高尔基的战斗号召，用自己的血肉和法西斯恶魔决斗，才能把全世界人类从危亡中挽救出来。
    一九三五年六月，由于高尔基的号召曾在巴黎召开国际作家保卫文化大会，将全世界进步的作家团结于反战旗帜之下，与世界最优秀文化代表如罗曼罗兰、巴比塞等人取得一致的行动以揭破战贩们的阴谋。
    一九四九年的五月，在与法西斯蒂决斗后的第四年，复有巴黎和布拉格的世界保卫和平代表大会的召集，这个历史的对照，将引起人们深切的回忆！
    高尔基，这位伟大的文化导师和非凡的革命战士，被敌人杀害了。反革命分子眼看高尔基对全世界号召的力量一天天扩大起来，就收买医生先把他最亲爱的儿子治死了。两年以后，高尔基患病，医生给了超过普通十四倍分量的药，使高尔基得心脏病而死。
    今天，全世界从法西斯铁掌里解放出来的人类，尤其是新民主主义国家的人民，来纪念这位伟大的先驱——高尔基，真有说不出的景慕与兴奋！
