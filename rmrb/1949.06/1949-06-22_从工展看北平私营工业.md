    Observing Private Industry in Beiping from the Industrial Exhibition
    By our reporter Tian Liu
    The charts and graphs in the first exhibition hall, detailing the various industries in Beiping, are attracting tens of thousands of visitors, many of whom are copying them into their notebooks. One of these charts records the production status of various industries after the liberation of Beiping. It shows that in January, the last month under the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang, the mechanized flour milling industry was completely shut down due to the lack of electricity. With the liberation of Beiping, the flour industry was revived. According to statistics from 19 flour mills participating in the Industrial Guild in February, 62,000 bags of "Communist flour" were produced, and the output increased every month thereafter, reaching 130,000 bags in May. Taking the first month after liberation as the base, the output of the weaving and dyeing industry increased fivefold, agricultural implements manufacturing rose by onefold, and oil pressing increased fivefold. Other industries such as papermaking, leather manufacturing, and rubber processing also showed significant increases in output. Although the production volume of some industrial sectors has not yet reached the pre-war levels or the levels during the Japanese occupation, the common trend of rapid monthly growth in various industries gives everyone a strong impression: it will not be long before we catch up with and even surpass the pre-war production levels.
    What caused the monthly increase in Beiping's industrial production? Zhang Jiantang, the chief engineer of the private Huaxing Dyeing and Weaving Factory, wrote at the beginning of the production statistics table of the factory: "Before liberation, our industry was subject to imperialist aggression and the oppression of bureaucratic capital, and could not develop or produce. After liberation, under the new democratic industrial construction policy, and with the leadership and support of the People's Government, it can develop freely." This is the factory's own experience. In the year before last, a total of 7,666 pieces of cloth were dyed and 3,573 pieces were woven. Last year, 6,551 pieces of cloth were dyed and 6,157 pieces were woven. After liberation, with the support of the National Trade Corporation, the method of exchanging yarn for cloth and providing cloth for dyeing processing was adopted. In May alone, 8,100 pieces of cloth were dyed, exceeding the total annual output before liberation. According to statistics from six industries including knitting, cigarettes, iron, matches, soap making, and flour milling, the Beijing Trade Corporation supports over 740 such industrial enterprises, accounting for more than 50% of the total number of households in these six industries. The facts of the five months since liberation prove that this method is successful and in line with the people's democratic country's economic policy of "taking into consideration both public and private interests." Taking the 18 machine flour mills supported by the Trade Corporation as an example, before liberation, the industry had a total of 32 electric mills in operation, with 355 workers, producing 3,285 bags of flour per day. After liberation, only 24 mills were operating in these 18 flour mills, the number of workers was reduced to 268, and the daily output was only 2,100 bags. In April, the support method of exchanging 100 catties of wheat for 75 catties of flour was adopted, solving the difficulties of purchasing raw materials and selling finished products for each factory. The number of electric mills in operation has increased to 42, the number of workers has increased to 398, and the daily output has reached 5,350 bags. In short, with the correct policy of the People's Government to protect and develop industry, and with the support and leadership of the state-owned economy, a path for the development of private industry has been opened up.

    从工展看北平私营工业
    本报记者  田流
    第一展览室陈列着的关于北平全市各种工业的图表，吸引着成千上万的参观者，有许多人还把各种各样的图表抄录在自己的小本子上。其中有一张图表是记载北平解放后各种工业的生产状况的，那上面记着：在国民党反动派统治的最后月份——今年一月，因为没有电力，机器制粉业完全停工；随着北平的解放，面粉业复活了，二月份据参加工业公会的十九家面粉厂统计，共产粉六万二千袋，以后就月月增加。五月份已产到十三万袋了。以解放后的第一个月为基数，织染业产量提高了五倍，农具制造业上涨了一倍，榨油业上涨五倍。其他如造纸、制革、橡胶……各种工业的产量也有了显著提高。虽然还有些工业部门的生产量还赶不上战前或日寇侵占时期的水平，但从各种工业逐月迅速增涨这一共同点看，就给了所有的人一种强烈的印象：用不了很久，我们就会赶上甚至超过战前生产水平的。
    什么原因使北平工业生产在逐月增涨呢？私营华兴染织厂总工程师张俭堂在他绘制的该厂生产统计表上一开头就写道：“解放前，我们的工业外受帝国主义侵略，内受官僚资本的压迫，不得发展与生产；解放后，在新民主主义工业建设方针下，经人民政府的领导与扶助，能得自由发展。”这是该厂的亲身经验。前年共染布七、六六六匹，织布三、五七三匹，去年染布六、五五一匹，织布六、一五七匹；解放后在国家贸易公司扶助下，采取以纱换布，供布加工染色的办法。五月份一个月就染色八、一○○匹，超过了解放前全年的产量。北平市贸易公司象这样扶助的工业，据针织、纸烟、铁业、火柴、造胰、制粉等六种统计，即达七四○余家，占该六种工业总户数的百分之五十以上。解放五个月来的事实证明，这种方法是成功的、符合人民民主国家“公私兼顾”的经济政策。以贸易公司扶助的十八家机器制粉工业为例，该业在解放前开动的电磨共三十二台，有工人三五五人，每日产粉三、二八五袋，解放后这十八家面粉厂只开动着二十四台，工人也减少到二六八人，每日仅产粉二、一○○袋。四月开始采用以百斤麦子换七五斤面粉的扶助办法，解决了各厂采购原料与推销成品的困难后，开动的电磨已增至四十二台，工人增加到三九八人，每日产量达到五、三五○袋。总之，有了人民政府保护发展工业的正确政策，有了国营经济的扶助与领导，就给私营工业开拓了向前发展的道路。
