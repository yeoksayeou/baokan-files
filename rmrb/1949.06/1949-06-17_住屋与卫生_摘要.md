Excerpt on "Housing and Hygiene"

The world has never seen health and longevity come from dirt and uncleanliness.

Nor has there ever been a nation made rich and powerful by a weak people.

　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　
I have lived in Singapore, Nanyang for over fifty years. When I first arrived, the municipality had already stipulated registration of births and deaths, and paid great attention to the hygiene of its citizens. Things like tap water, epidemic prevention, mosquito control, and slaughter management, etc., were all equipped for. Each month, people were sent to inspect whether the houses were clean. Public ditches, streets and garbage were swept daily, and transported outside the city for destruction. The annual mortality rate for citizens averaged twenty-four to twenty-five deaths per thousand people. Although epidemics were common, they were quickly eradicated and did not spread. This was before the tenth year of the Republic of China. Since then, the municipality has undergone major reforms, gradually rebuilding all housing that did not meet hygiene standards, according to a general city plan. The current mortality rate is only fourteen to fifteen per thousand people, a reduction of four-tenths compared to twenty years ago, and epidemics are rare. This is the effect of improving housing. I have heard that there are three basic elements to hygiene: air, sunlight, and cleanliness. Other minor issues are numerous, but easier to resolve. The year before last, as a representative of the Nanyang Chinese, I returned to China to comfort the military and civilians in the War of Resistance. Having passed through thousands of cities and villages in ten provinces, I saw that the sanitary conditions of streets and rural houses were far inferior to those of Singapore twenty years ago. Although the street houses in the urban areas had been slightly renovated, the streets were still narrow, and the shops only decorated the facades. As for rural houses, most lacked adequate windows, and the toilets, ditches and garbage were extremely filthy. If births and deaths were registered, the annual mortality rate would definitely be higher than when the Singapore municipality had not yet improved.

Before the tenth year of the Republic of China, most old-style houses in Singapore were built to the very edge of the land. The backs of the houses were connected, with no alleys, and even a lack of windows. Although the houses had patios, they were mostly small and covered. The houses had many rooms but few windows, and air and sunlight could not circulate freely. The ditches were long and difficult to clean. Water, air and sunlight are most important for life. Lack of air reduces vitality. A lack of sunlight in the house promotes the growth of bacteria and pests. Water is important not only for drinking, but also for bathing and cleaning.

Since the tenth year of the Republic of China, Singapore has carried out a comprehensive reform of the city, stipulating that certain streets should be a certain number of feet wide, and that the rear of the houses should have a certain number of feet of space (recently stipulated to be at least fifteen feet). Certain areas were designated for government and public institutions, others for parks, sports fields and recreation areas, and certain districts were designated for factories and warehouses, while other shops and residences were also assigned to specific zones. The length of ordinary shops and residences in the city was limited. Old-style houses that had already been built beyond the limit were required to be demolished. The remaining open space could not be rebuilt with small houses, but was managed by the municipal council as playgrounds, sports fields or gardens. However, given the size of the city, this could not be achieved in a short period of time, so priority was given to the more important areas, and all repairs or reconstructions were required to be carried out according to the new plans. Much has been improved in the last ten years or so, making it suitable for hygiene.

Since World War II, European and American hygiene experts have paid more attention to the improvement of housing construction. In Singapore, the front of the house could occupy nearly two-thirds of the entire site, but now it cannot, and is limited to no more than half of the total area. Previously, shop houses and residences in the city were limited to 80 to 100 feet in length, and one-third of the land had to be left open to the sky, with a small house built on half, and at least eight or nine feet of space left at the rear. Now this has been revised, stipulating that each house should be no more than 75 feet long, with fifteen feet at the rear, and the backs of two houses facing each other should each occupy seven and a half feet at the rear. This means that the entire length of the site and the rear space occupied can be 82.5 feet, plus 18 feet wide, totaling an area of ​​1,485 square feet. The main body of the house is 40 feet long, covering an area of ​​720 square feet; the small house at the rear is 35 feet long and 9 feet wide, covering an area of ​​315 square feet; totaling 1,035 square feet. Excluding 126 square feet under the arcade and about 167 square feet for the walls, the actual interior of the house is 742 square feet, leaving 743 square feet, i.e. 135 square feet at the rear, 315 square feet of open space in front of the small house, and the space for the walls and arcades. In short, regardless of the width or size of each house, the interior of the house must not occupy more than half of the total site area. If the corner houses are on the edges of roads, the interior of the house can be built to two-thirds of the total site area due to the proximity to the roads. If shops declare that they do not house families or employees, the interior of the house can occupy nine-tenths of the remaining site area, excluding the arcade, walls and rear space. Other apartments, large buildings, workers' dormitories, etc., are planned separately, according to hygiene standards. The ditches are all built in an open style, with sewage flowing out from the rear, making it easy to clean.

Since the promulgation of the municipal master plan, the front streets and rear spaces in various places have been widened according to regulations, arranged in an orderly and beautiful manner. In the event of a fire, it is easy to extinguish. However, the only drawback is that no matter how much the old streets are widened, the width is still inadequate. The straight streets are only sixty or seventy feet wide, and the cross streets are only thirty or forty feet wide, which is not as good as the new city area, where the straight streets are nearly a hundred feet wide, with sidewalks on both sides, and lined with beautiful trees; the cross streets are fifty or sixty feet wide; and the houses have open spaces in front, or short walls are built and flowers and plants are planted, which is pleasing to the eye and refreshing, like a garden, making one feel refreshed. Residents are at peace, healthy and less sick, saving a lot of money on medicine, superstition, insurance, etc. The city becomes more prosperous day by day, and the owners get more profit.

Twenty years ago, in Europe and the United States, where urban housing had been improved, the mortality rate in London, England, was 14 per thousand people per year, in Paris, France, 13 per thousand people per year, in Berlin, Germany, 11 per thousand people per year, in New York, USA, 16 per thousand people per year, in Chicago, 15 per thousand people per year, and in Seattle (newly opened port for only a few decades), 9 per thousand people per year. In New Orleans, which has not yet been improved, 21 per thousand people die. London also has slums with a population of more than 100,000. According to the statistics of the medical officer, the mortality rate is about 20 to 30 per thousand people per year, and the infant mortality rate is even higher. Even those who can grow up are less healthy. There is no registration of births and deaths among residents in our cities. If there were, the high mortality rate would be astonishing.

The lack of hygiene in housing is particularly serious in rural areas in our country. Because people do not know the value of air and sunlight when building houses, and are often afraid of wind and sun, the houses have small doors and few windows, so not only is there a lack of air, but it is even more difficult for sunlight to enter. Toilets are set up indiscriminately, ditches are not cleaned, garbage accumulates, wells have no railings, or are only dozens of steps away from toilets. Various malpractices are extremely harmful. However, it is not easy to improve housing. If we start with simple measures, we can open more windows to allow air and sunlight to enter. Toilets should be reduced as much as possible and improved to prevent mosquitoes from breeding. Ditches and garbage should be hired to be cleaned and destroyed daily. Wells should be fenced and must be 100 steps away from toilets. Other wetlands and ponds are prone to mosquitoes, and should be filled or ditches dug to allow water to flow. In this way, the basic hygiene will be established, and the benefits will be significant, while the cost will not be high. Any poor rural household can do it, depending on whether the government is responsible or not. As for cleaning outside the house, Chinese people often assign it to women, and men rarely ask about it. Europeans and Americans are not like this. Men also take joint responsibility for guiding or helping. If Chinese people really want to promote and implement the improvement of hygiene, men must work harder.

Twenty years ago, European hygienists studied the length of human life in the world, comparing the three regions with the largest populations: Europe, China and India. The average life expectancy in each region: Europeans, 54 to 55 years per person, Chinese, 39 to 40 years per person, and Indians, 28 to 29 years per person. However, this was more than 20 years ago. Later, European and American medical researchers determined that Europeans would soon reach an average of about 70 years per person, which shows that their hygienic science is progressing daily. One hundred years ago, Europeans averaged only about 40 years per person. The short life expectancy of Indians is mainly due to the harm of early marriage (although Chinese people also have early marriage, but not as much as Indians), and the most important reason is unhygienic housing. Some say that there is also a difference in food and nutrition, and the main food of Chinese and Indians is far inferior to that of Europeans. This statement seems to be true but is not. For example, the citizens of Singapore have been eating rice, so why is the mortality rate so different in 20 years? If Europeans eat more meat, why can't the people of Qinghai Province in China, who eat mutton for every meal, live as long as Europeans?

The international sports games held in Berlin, Germany, last year and London, England, last year attracted worldwide attention. Our country spent a huge sum of money on this matter, gathering famous athletes to show their skills twice on the stage of international sports competitions, but the result was that they returned with nothing both times. The reason for this is not that the skills of various competitions are not refined, but that the physical strength is insufficient, so that all results failed. This shows that the soundness of the national physique must be cultivated, and cannot be achieved quickly through short-term training. Therefore, the fundamental problem of hygiene must be completely solved. Not only can physical strength be enhanced, but longevity can also be expected.

European and American countries have numerous medical schools and many doctors, with an average of one doctor for every few thousand people. The important purpose of medicine is twofold: first, hygiene to prevent diseases, and second, to treat diseases. Our country has few medical schools and the number of doctors is insignificant, with fewer than one doctor for every tens of thousands of people. Although there are some Chinese medicine doctors, they are not enough to meet the needs of society, and the people pay little attention to the methods of preventing problems before they occur. In the future, the new government will actively establish medical schools, but it will not be possible to popularize and achieve results in a short period of time. However, advanced countries have sufficient experience in hygiene facilities, such as Singapore, the city with the largest number of overseas Chinese in the colony, and its hygiene facilities are worth learning from and imitating.

The population of Britain and the United States is less than half of that of our country, but the cities of London in Britain and New York in the United States each have more than 8 million citizens. Chicago had only 1,000 people a hundred years ago, and now it has grown to more than 3 million. Hundreds of years from now, China's transportation hubs will have many cities as prosperous as London and New York, and there will be many like Chicago. Think about it, before the invention of steam and electricity, European and American cities could develop like this, but now it is very different, and prosperity can be achieved quickly. Therefore, we should take this opportunity to broaden our horizons, survey and plan cities across the country, and predetermine city maps so that streets are straight and orderly, and the width of the front streets and rear spaces is appropriate. At present, we should first build two- or three-story buildings, and later we can rebuild ten- or eight-story high-rise buildings. As for open spaces such as streets, parks, sports fields, lawns and gardens, they should occupy at least half of the area in the entire urban area. If our cities are reformed from now on, the loss will not be great. If we proceed with perseverance, after ten or twenty years, all cities in the country will have the beauty of gardens, and residents will enjoy health and longevity.

　　“住屋与卫生”摘要
    世未有肮脏不洁、而能健身长寿。
    亦未有人民孱弱、而能富国强兵。
    　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　
    余居南洋新嘉坡五十余年。初到时市政已规定生死登记，对市民卫生甚注意。如自来水防疫除蚊屠宰管理等等，均有设备，每月派人视察屋内是否清洁。公共沟渠街道垃圾，逐日清扫，运市外消毁。而每年市民死亡率，平均每千人死二十四五人。疫症虽常有，然迅速消灭，不至蔓延。此乃民国十年以前之事。从彼时起，市政更大改革，将全市总计划，凡不合卫生住屋，逐渐改建。至现下死亡率，每千人仅十四五人，比较二十余年前减死十分之四，而疫症已罕有。此盖为改善住屋之效果也。闻卫生根本有三项：空气，日光，清洁。其他次要者虽多，较易解决。余前年代表南侨回国慰劳抗战军民，经十余省，历城市乡村千百数，见街衢及乡村屋宅，卫生状况比较新嘉坡二十余年前，尚远不及。市区街屋虽略有改造，街道仍狭，店屋只整饰门面而已。至乡村屋宅，多乏相当窗牖，厕所沟渠垃圾，甚形污秽。生死若有登记，每年死亡率，必更多于新嘉坡市政未改善时也。
    新嘉坡在民国十年以前，诸旧式屋宅，多尽地建筑。屋后相接，不但无＠路，甚至乏窗户。屋内虽有天井，多狭小且有遮盖。房多窗小，空气日光不能通达。沟渠长，清扫难。水空气日光对生命最为重要。空气少到，养气自减。屋内无日光，则细菌及害虫发生益盛。水不但关饮食，而洗澡清洁亦甚重要。
    新嘉坡自民国十年起，将全市总改革，规定某街若干尺阔，后＠应有若干尺（最近规定至少十五尺）。某处作政府及公共机关，某处作公园运动场游憩所，某区建工厂及货仓，其他商店住宅，亦各规定区域。市内普通店屋住宅，长度均有限定。前已建旧式屋宅过限者，概须拆卸。剩余空地，不得复建小屋，归市政局管理，作儿童游戏场运动场或花园。然以全市之大，非短时间可能办到，第分别较有关系者先进行，及每逢修理或改建，均须依新图式建筑。十余年间多已改善，适合卫生矣。
    世界第二次大战后，欧美卫生家，对住屋建筑之改善更为注重。以新嘉坡言，前屋身之内可占全屋址近三分之二，而今则不可，限定不得超过全面积半数。前市内店屋住宅，每屋限长八十英尺至一百英尺，须留露天空地三分之一，以一半建小屋，后＠至少须留八九英尺，兹均已修改，规定每屋至多长七十五英尺，后＠十五英尺，两座相背之屋各占后＠七英尺半，是则屋址及其所占后＠全长可有八十二英尺半，加阔十八英尺，合计面积为一千四百八十五英方尺。主要屋身长四十英尺，计面积七百二十英方尺；后方小屋长三十五英尺，阔九英尺，计面积三百十五英方尺；共计则为一千零三十五英方尺。除骑楼下一百二十六英方尺，墙位约一百六十七英方尺，屋身之内存实七百四十二英方尺，尚余七百四十三英方尺，即后＠一百三十五英方尺，小屋前露天空地三百十五英方尺，及墙位骑楼是也。总言之：每住屋不拘阔狭大小，屋身之内不得占过全址面积半数。若道路转弯处之边角屋宇，因临边路，屋身之内可建至全址三分之二。又如店屋声明不住家及职工者，除骑楼，墙位，后＠外，屋身之内可占其余地址十分之九。其他公寓大楼工人宿舍等，则另行计划。以适合卫生为标准。沟渠概造明式，污水从后＠流出，易于清洗。
    自市政总计划颁布后，各处前街后＠，即多照规定改阔，横直有序，整齐美观。逢有火灾，容易消灭。然美中不足者，则旧屋诸街，无论如何扩大，阔度尚感不足。直街不过六七十尺，横街三四十尺而已，不若新市区直街近百尺，两边兼有人行道，并栽种佳树；横街五六十尺；住宅面前留空地，或筑短墙，栽种花草，令人见之悦目开怀，似有园林之胜，精神为之快爽。居民既安，健康少病，医药迷信保险等费，终年省却不少。市区日益繁盛，业主更获多利矣。
    欧美二十余年前，城市住屋已经改善者，其死亡率英国伦敦每年每千人死十四人，法国巴黎每千人死十三人，德国柏林每千人死十一人，美国纽约每千人死十六人，芝加哥每千人死十五人，西雅图（新开埠仅数十年）每千人死九人。尚未改善之纽奥伦，每千人死二十一人。伦敦市亦有贫民区，人口十余万，住屋未改善，据医官统计报告，死亡率每年每千人中死二十余人至三十人左右，婴孩死亡率更大，即能成人身体亦少康强。我国各城市住民生死无登记，设有之，其死亡之多，必可惊叹也。
    我国人住屋不卫生，以乡村为尤甚。盖自建屋时原不知注意空气与日光之宝贵，习惯又多畏风日，故屋宅户小窗乏，不但空气不足，日光更难通达。厕池滥设，沟渠不清，垃圾积滞，水井无栏，或离厕所仅数十步。各种弊端，为害甚烈。然屋宅改善大非易事。若从简便着手，可多开窗户，使空气日光能达到。厕池则宜尽量缩减，并加以改良，令蚊虫不生。沟渠垃圾，应雇人负责按日清毁。水井宜筑栏，且须距离厕池百步之外。其他如湿地池塘，蚊虫易生，或须填塞，或须开沟以通流水。如此则卫生基本已立，收效定不在少，而费钱无多，任何穷乡贫户，都能办到，第视政府负责与否。至清扫屋外之事，我国人常专责妇女，男子多不闻问。欧美人则不然，男子亦共同负责指导，或帮助之。我国人对于改善卫生事，果欲提倡实行，男子更不可不努力也。
    二十年前欧洲卫生家，研究世界人类寿命长短，以人数最多之三区域民族比较，即欧洲、中国、印度。各区人寿平均：欧洲人每人五十四五岁，中国人每人三十九至四十岁，印度人每人二十八九岁。然此为二十多年前之事，后来欧美医学家研究会，断定将来不久，欧美人平均每人可达到七十岁左右，足见其卫生科学日有进步。查百年前，欧洲人每人平均亦仅四十岁左右。印度人寿命之短促，虽因早婚之害（我国人亦有早婚第不如印度人之甚），其重要原因，在乎住屋不卫生居多。或云食物滋养料亦有差别，中印人主要食物，远逊欧美人。此语似是实非。如新嘉坡市民自来食米，何以二十年间，死亡率相差甚远？若以欧美人多食肉类，我国青海省人三餐以羊肉作饭，何以不能如欧美人之长寿？
    前年德国柏林及去年英国伦敦，举行国际运动会，为全世所注意。我国为此事曾费去巨款，集诸有名运动家，两次现身手于国际体育比赛之舞台，然其结果两次均饱吃鸭蛋而归。考其原因，各种比赛，非由技艺不精，实因体力不足，故致全归失败，足见国民体格之健全，要在素养得来，非短少时间之训练所能速成。故对卫生根本问题，必须彻底解决。不但体力可以增强。而长寿当然亦可期矣。
    欧美诸国医科学校林立，医生众多，平均数千人中有一医生，医学重要目的有二，首为卫生预防疾病，次为医治诸疾病，我国医科学校寡少，医生数微不足道，数万人中尚乏一人，虽有些少中医，殊不足以应社会之需要，且民间对曲突徙薪之卫生方法绝少注意，此后新政府对医科学校，虽然积极兴设，然非短促年龄可能普及收效，惟先进邦域之卫生设施已有充分经验，如殖民地中华侨最众之新嘉坡市，其卫生设施即值得吾人取法仿效。
    英美人民不及我国半数，而英京伦敦美国纽约，市民各八百余万人。又芝加哥市百年前仅有一千人，现今增至三百余万人。我国百数十年后，交通中心城市，其繁盛如伦敦纽约者必有多处，如芝加哥者当亦不少。试思前此蒸汽电力发明未备，欧美城市即能如此发展，现下已大不同，繁荣可以速臻。故宜乘兹放大眼光，将全国各城市测划，预定市图，使街路横直整齐，前街后＠阔度相当。目前先建二层三层楼屋，后来可改建十层八层高楼。至各街路公园运动场草地花园等空地，在全市区至少当占面积半数。我国各城市若从兹改革，损失不大。毅力进行，一二十年之后，全国城市皆有园林之胜，居民获寿康之福矣。
