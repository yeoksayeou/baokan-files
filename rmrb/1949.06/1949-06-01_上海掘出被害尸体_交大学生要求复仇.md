    【Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 31st】 Before the liberation of Shanghai, the Kuomintang bandit gang slaughtered a large number of patriotic youths in the city. The People's Liberation Army troops stationed in Shanghai have discovered some of the bodies of the deceased. On the 28th, more than 30 bodies were exhumed from the wasteland on the right side of the Hongqiao Cemetery on Hongqiao Road, opposite the Merlin Canning Factory. The identified bodies include Shi Xiaowen and Mu Hanhui, both fourth-year students of Jiaotong University. The remaining bodies are awaiting identification by the families of the victims. Shi and Mu were arrested on May 2nd by bandit police on the street. Their names were also found on the roster of the detention center of the former Police Bureau after the liberation. Upon hearing the news, the students of Jiaotong University were extremely saddened and indignant, demanding the arrest of Mao Sen, the head of the military secret service and former head of the Shanghai Police Bureau, who was responsible for the killing of patriotic youths, to avenge the dead. The student union of the university is cooperating with the university authorities to bury the martyred students.
