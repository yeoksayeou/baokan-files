　　Where is Beiping's Financial Industry Heading?
    Jiang Heng
  　I. Beiping's Financial Industry in Hesitation and Observation
    In the past, Beiping's banks, silver firms, and money shops relied on deposits from warlords and politicians, speculation, usury, and exploitation of the people to maintain their existence. Today, Beiping has been liberated and become a city of the people. The four major banks, the Central Bank of China, the Bank of China, the Bank of Communications, and the Farmers Bank of China, have been confiscated and nationalized! Of course, the general owners of banks and shops are still "waiting for an opportunity to act," hoping to make some extra money. In fact, some banks and shops are still secretly engaging in black market trading of gold, silver, and US dollars, but they are gradually losing their ability to control the market. Speculation is difficult, and relying on deposits from warlords and politicians is no longer possible. Should they just engage in legitimate business? Past parasitic lifestyles and ideological concerns prevent them from doing so quickly. Therefore, apart from six banks, including Jin Cheng, Ju Xing Cheng, Shi Ye, and Shanghai Commercial, which have started remittance services, most banks and shops are still hesitating, waiting, and observing at the crossroads, and are in a state of stagnation. The owners only hope to recover their funds quickly and live off their savings. Currently, most banks and shops, concerned about whether they can "survive," are secretly dispersing their funds, laying off employees, maintaining appearances, or preparing to close down.
    II. Where Should They Go?
    Where should these private banks and money shops go? Should they continue to maintain their past comprador, feudal, and speculative nature, and follow a path of undermining production? Or should they turn to serving industrial and agricultural production and serving the broad masses of the people? Especially after the North China People's Government has promulgated the "Provisional Measures for the Administration of Private Banks and Money Shops," they should consider and choose! As for these private bank and money shop operators themselves, although they have more or less engaged in speculative activities and extorted the people in the old society, they have also objectively done some useful work in regulating social funds and supporting the development of industry and commerce. Furthermore, due to China's economic backwardness and Beiping's status as a consumer city, it is necessary to maximize the positive role of private capitalism for a considerable period after liberation, in order to promote the forward development of the national economy. In particular, it is very important to use existing funds to promote the rapid recovery and development of industry and commerce. According to rough statistics, there are forty-one private silver firms and money shops in Beiping after liberation. Excluding one whose strength is unknown, they have a total capital equivalent to 26,300 taels of gold, averaging about 660 taels per shop. There are eight shops with over 1,000 taels, and only six shops with 200-300 taels. In addition, there are eighteen private banks, most of which are invested by former military and political personnel, so their capital is even greater. If such huge capital is truly transformed into legitimate business operations and genuinely serves industrial and agricultural construction, it will not only greatly benefit the national economy and the people's livelihood, but also bring real benefits to the bank and money shop operators. Because the profits from this kind of operation are legitimate profits, not speculative and extortionate "ill-gotten gains."
    III. How to Turn to Business that Benefits the National Economy and the People's Livelihood?
    To enable Beiping's private banks and money shops to provide a positive role to the national economy and to play a role in promoting the development of industry and agriculture, it is necessary to completely change the past direction of hoarding, lending at usurious rates, and engaging in black market speculation, and to broaden their horizons, think long-term, and allow funds to flow into the field of production in large quantities. But according to the actual situation of these banks and money shops, how can they move from business practices that hinder production to production and construction undertakings that benefit the national economy and the people's livelihood?
    To lead and promote these dozens of private banks and money shops in Beiping to turn to production, and to change their parasitic thinking, and to establish a little production concept and a concept of considering the interests of the country and the people, it is first necessary to appropriately resolve their ideological concerns, so that they know that the trinity rule of imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism has devastated China's industrial and agricultural production undertakings; and speculative undertakings have achieved abnormal development under the advocacy of bureaucratic capital. Therefore, it is not surprising that national capital, especially financial operators, have left the production sector and turned to speculation. Now the People's Liberation War has destroyed the rule of imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism, and the People's Government will adopt all effective measures to protect and reward industrial and agricultural production undertakings, and restrict speculative and various improper activities, and when necessary, will severely crack down on rampant speculative activities for the benefit of the people.
    The government requires all banks and shops to conduct business activities in accordance with the promulgated "Provisional Measures for the Administration of Private Banks and Money Shops," and its purpose is positive, not negative. Because management is different from control, the purpose of management is to develop the business activities of private banks and money shops in the right direction that is beneficial to economic construction. Today, banks and money shops are still closely integrated with industry and commerce and cannot be separated. Therefore, to restore and develop the national economy, and to turn consumer cities into productive cities, it is necessary to implement reasonable supervision and effective regulation of market activities, commodity production, and distribution. Today, it is hoped that the owners of private banks and money shops will deeply understand the government's intentions and the changes of the times. The more thoroughly they understand and the more quickly they transform, the more they will take the lead in the industry and the more promising their future will be.

　　北平金融业走向哪里？
    江  横
  　一、徘徊观望中的北平金融业
    北平银行、银号、钱庄业，过去是依靠军阀政客存款、投机倒把、放高利贷和剥削人民，来维持它的生命的；今天北平解放后，已成为人民的城市；中、中、交、农四行已被没收为国有了！当然，一般的行庄老板还是在“伺机而动”，想捞点外财；事实上，今天还有一些行庄在偷偷摸摸的搞黑市金银美钞的勾当，不过已经逐渐的不能左右市场了。投机倒把既很困难，依靠军阀政客存款也不可得，只做正当的营业吧？已往的寄生生活和思想顾虑，使它们又不能迅然如此做。所以，北平除了金城、聚兴诚、实业、上海商业等六行已开始汇兑业外，一般行庄还在十字路口徘徊、等待、观望，而陷于停顿状态；老板们只希望赶快收回款子，坐吃消耗。现大部行庄因顾虑能否“存在”，便暗中分散资金，遣散职员，或应付门面，或准备结束。
    二、应该走向哪里？
    这些私营银钱业究应走向哪里呢？是继续保持过去的那种买办性，封建性，投机性，进行破坏生产事业的道路呢？还是转向为工农业生产建设服务，为广大人民服务呢？特别是在华北人民政府已颁布私营银钱业管理暂行办法之后，应该有所考虑和选择了！就以这些私营银钱业者本身来说，虽在过去旧社会里也或多或少的做过投机倒把敲榨人民的罪恶勾当，但也在客观上多少做了一点调剂社会资金，扶助工商业发展的有益的工作。再就是由于中国的经济落后，北平又是消费城市，在解放后一个相当长的时期内，还需要尽可能地发挥私人资本主义的积极性，以利于国民经济的向前发展。特别是运用现有的资金，以推动工商业的迅速恢复和发展，甚为重要。据不精确的统计：解放后北平私营银号钱庄有四十一家，除一家实力不详外，共有资金折合黄金二万六千三百两，平均每家约六百六十两左右，一千两者有八家，二、三百两者只六家。另外有十八家私营银行，因为大部是旧时军政人员的投资，所以资金更为巨大。以这样巨大的资本，真正转化为正当的业务经营，切实服务于工农业建设，既大有利于国计民生，银钱业者亦可获得实惠。因为这种经营的盈利，已是正当的盈利而不是投机敲榨的“横财”了。
    三、怎样转向有利于国计民生的业务？
    要使北平私营的银钱业能对国民经济提供积极的作用，能发挥其推动工业农业发展的作用，就必须彻头彻尾地改变过去囤集居奇、放高利贷和黑市投机的方向，而放大眼界，从远处着想，使资金大量流入生产的领域中去。但根据这些银钱业的实际情况，又怎么会由阻碍生产的经营方式走向有利于国计民生的生产建设事业呢？
    要领导和推动北平这数十家私营银钱业转向生产，和改变寄生思想，而多少建立一点生产观念和为国家人民利益设想的观念，但必须首先适当解决他们的思想顾虑，使他们知道过去帝国主义、封建主义、官僚资本主义三位一体的统治，摧残着中国的工农生产事业；而投机事业则在官僚资本的倡导下，得到了畸形的发展，因此民族资本，特别是金融业者离开了生产事业，转向投机倒把，那是丝毫不足奇怪的。现在人民解放战争已经摧毁了帝国主义、封建主义、官僚资本主义的统治，人民政府必将采用一切有效的办法来保护和奖励工农生产事业，并限制投机倒把各种不正当的活动，必要时将为着人民的利益，而予猖狂的投机活动以沉重的打击。
    政府要求各行庄依据所颁布的私营银钱业管理暂行办法，进行业务活动，其目的是积极的，不是消极的。因为管理不同于管制，管理的目的是要使私营银钱业的业务活动，向着有利于经济建设事业的正途中发展。银钱业今天仍与工业商业密切结合不可分离，所以，要恢复与发展国民经济，要使消费城市变为生产城市，那就必须对市场的活动、商品的生产和分配，实施合理的监督和有效的调节。今天希望私营银钱业的业主们深切体会政府的用意和时代的转变，他们愈能体会得透澈愈能迅速的转变，他们就愈能在同业中占先，愈有发展的前途。
