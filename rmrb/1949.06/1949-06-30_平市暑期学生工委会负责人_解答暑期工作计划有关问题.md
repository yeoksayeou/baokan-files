The person in charge of the Ping City Summer Vacation Student Work Committee answered questions from reporters regarding the published summer work plan:

    Q: Is participation in the Youth Academy and the summer study groups for universities and middle schools entirely voluntary? After signing up, is it necessary to participate in all activities?

    A: The basic spirit of our summer work plan is to meet the learning requirements of the vast majority of students, give full play to the spirit of democratic unity, and the characteristics of youthfulness. We hope that everyone will be together to truly have a good summer vacation. Participation in the Youth Academy and study groups is entirely voluntary and has nothing in common with the forced training or summer military training of the Kuomintang's Sanmin Zhuyi Youth Corps. The content of the Youth Academy is diverse, and each person can participate in one or several activities according to their own wishes and time. For example, one can attend youth lectures every time, or choose to listen to topics that one finds interesting. In short, although there are many activities, it is not necessary for those who sign up to participate in every item. The principle is based on everyone's voluntary participation and needs. As for the summer study groups for universities and middle schools, they are similar to short-term summer schools. After entering the school, learning and discussions must be fully participated in in order to complete a certain teaching plan. The main reason why we are holding two types of learning organizations, the Youth Academy and the summer study groups for universities and middle school students, is because some students hope to concentrate their food and lodging to participate in learning full-time, while others hope to participate in more flexible, unrestricted learning and various recreational service activities.

    Q: Are there any restrictions on the number of participants?

    A: There is no limit to the number of participants in the Youth Academy. However, due to limited conditions such as housing and funding, the summer study groups for universities and middle school students are tentatively limited to a maximum of 2,000 people. Among them, in addition to allocating half to the Youth League members, the other half will be open for students from various schools to voluntarily sign up. If the number of applicants exceeds 1,000, the Summer Vacation Student Work Committee will review the application forms and the answers to the test questions (i.e., the essays written on the application form) to determine whether to admit them. As for the number of students admitted from each school, there is no fixed number. In principle, we hope that it will be more widespread, that is, students from all schools can come to study, but there is no quota or restriction on any school exceeding a certain number.

    Q: What should students from poor families do if they want to join the study group but cannot afford the meal fees?

    A: Students from poor families mostly have the benefit of People's Student Aid or temporary relief funds. However, if they are still unable to pay the equivalent of seventy catties of millet, they can obtain a certificate from the student union and Youth League branch of their school (those without a Youth League branch only need a certificate from the student union) to apply for a subsidy.

    Finally, the person in charge of the Summer Vacation Student Work Committee told reporters: The Youth Academy will be held in five districts to facilitate student participation. If some students' schools are in the southeast district, but their homes are close to the Youth Academy in the central district, they can participate in the activities of the Youth Academy in the central district. Students from other places who return to Ping City for the summer vacation and wish to participate can also bring their student identification and other documents to register. We hope that some students who leave Ping City to return home will participate in some collective activities of the local youth as much as possible after returning to their hometowns. We hope to use the summer vacation to assist the local government in carrying out cultural and educational service activities.

　　平市暑期学生工委会负责人
  　解答暑期工作计划有关问题
    【本报讯】平市暑期学生工作委员会负责人，顷就所发表的暑期工作计划中若干问题答复记者如下：
    问：参加青年学园和大中学暑期学习团是否完全自愿？报名后，各种活动是否要全部参加？
    答：我们的暑期工作计划的基本精神是适应广大同学的学习要求，充分发挥民主团结的精神，与青年化的特点，我们希望大家共同在一起，把暑期真正过好。参加青年学园和学习团完全是自愿的，和国民党三青团的强迫受训或暑期军训无丝毫相同之点。青年学园内容多种多样，各人可以完全按自己意愿和时间，参加一种或数种。例如听青年讲座可以每次来听，也可选听自己感到有兴趣的题目。总之，活动虽多，但并非要报名者每项一定参加，而是根据大家自愿与需要为原则。至于大中学暑期学习团，则类似一短期的暑期学校，入校后学习及讨论等则须全部参加，以便完成一定的教学计划。我们所以举办青年学园和大中学生暑期学习团两种学习组织，主要也是因为广大同学有的希望集中食宿以全部时间参加学习，有的则希望参加比较灵活、不严加限制的学习及各种文娱服务活动。
    问：参加名额是否有限制？
    答：青年学园参加名额并无限制。而大中学生暑期学习团则由于房屋、经费等条件所限，暂定最多只收两千人。其中除调集青年团员占半数外，一半则由各校同学自愿报名参加。报名数额超过千名以上时，则根据申请书及所答的试题（即申请书上写的短文），由暑期学生工作委员会审定是否录取。至于各校录取名额，并无一定，原则上虽希望能较为普遍，即各校都能有同学来学习，但并未规定名额，或限制某校不得超过某数等。
    问：家庭贫困，想入学习团而缴不起膳费的如何办？
    答：家庭贫困的同学，多半有人民助学金或临时救济金的待遇，但如尚不能缴足七十斤小米者，可以取得本校学生会及青年团支部证明（无青年团支部者，只须学生会证明即可），可以申请补助。
    最后，暑期工作委员会负责人告诉记者：青年学园分五区举办，以便利同学参加，有些同学学校在东南区，若家离中心区的青年学园近，则可参加中心区青年学园的活动。其他各地暑期回平的同学如愿参加，也可带学生证件等来报名。有些离平回家的同学，我们希望他们回乡后尽可能参加该地青年一些集体活动。希望利用暑假，协助当地政府做文化教育服务活动。
