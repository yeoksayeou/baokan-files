　　People's Bank of Central Hebei Branches Trial Order-Based Loans to Support Local Industry
    [Central Hebei Dispatch] To solve the difficulties of industrial production in unfavorable seasons, when finished products are not easily sold and capital turnover is difficult, the People's Bank of Central Hebei branches began piloting order-based loans in the middle of last month to support industrial production. Hejian Bank loaned 1.57 million yuan to the public-owned Qunli Iron Factory to order 25,000 pots. The factory bought more than 100,000 jin of iron from Zangqiao, which can supply 30 workers for one and a half months of production. It also loaned 37,000 yuan to the Qunli Knitting Factory to order 42 dozens of socks. It loaned 850,000 yuan to the Yiju and Yongli oil mills to order 3,000 jin of oil. The Xinji Bank Office ordered 765 leather jackets from 33 white leather businesses, with a loan of 2.19 million yuan, which can buy 5,500 pieces of white leather, allowing them to continue production. The Ding County Military Cooperative Ginnery has six electrically powered cotton gins. Because it lacked funds, it ginned cotton by hand for others. The Ding County branch, in order to restore its production, negotiated and signed a contract. The bank loaned funds to purchase cotton in the market, and then converted the loan into cotton according to the purchase price of the cotton. A total of 9.98 million yuan was loaned to purchase 4,200 jin of cotton. After ginning, the factory delivered 32 jin of lint cotton to the bank for every 100 jin of seed cotton. The factory is now in production and continues to purchase cotton. In addition, Xingji Branch and others also provided loans to purchase oil. Various factories and cooperatives have expressed their gratitude to the bank for its loan-based ordering support.
