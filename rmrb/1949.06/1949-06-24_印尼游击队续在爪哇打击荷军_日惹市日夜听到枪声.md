Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 23rd: Reports from various sources: In mid-June, Indonesian guerrillas continued to strike Dutch occupiers in various parts of Java. Gunfire was heard day and night in Yogyakarta. Snipers frequently attacked Dutch transport vehicles on the Yogyakarta-Magelang highway. The oil depot in Semarang was bombed on the 20th, and the stockpiles were completely reduced to ashes. In other areas of Central Java, especially Solo, Madiun, Purwokerto, Purbalingga, Cilacap, etc., attacks occurred. In the Caruban area of East Java, guerrillas constantly inflicted blows on the enemy. In West Java, according to incomplete statistics: guerrillas destroyed two railways, attacked trains twice, derailed a train once, attacked a station once, and carried out countless other attacks in recent days. Dutch plantations near Medan in Sumatra were also destroyed by guerrillas.

Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 22nd: The Hague dispatch: The Dutch Communist Party newspaper *De Waarheid* published a message on the 20th about the terrible situation in Dutch concentration camps on the island of Java, stating: "Hundreds of thousands of Indonesians are being imprisoned, many of whom have been sentenced to death by Dutch colonial courts. The air in the concentration camps is even worse than in Hitler's former death camps. Hundreds of prisoners are locked in airless rooms. They are all being driven to the brink of death by heat and hunger. These sufferers only get a handful of rice a day. Prisoners do not have enough water to drink." The message concludes: The Dutch government is using this method to establish so-called "peace and order" in Indonesia.

    印尼游击队续在爪哇打击荷军
    日惹市日夜听到枪声
    【新华社北平二十三日电】各方报道：本月中旬，印尼游击队继续在爪哇各地打击荷兰占领者。日惹市日夜听到枪声。日惹至马吉公路上，狙击兵频袭荷兰运输车辆。三宝垄的油库于二十日被炸毁，堆栈全部化为灰烬。中爪哇的其他地区，尤其是梭罗、茉莉芬、帕乌卡托、帕巴林加、伊森朱玛斯等地，都发生袭击事件。东爪哇的查鲁班地区，游击队不断予敌以打击。西爪哇方面，据不完全统计：游击队曾于近数日内破坏铁路两处，袭击火车两次，使火车出轨一次，袭击车站一次，其他袭击事件无数。苏门答腊棉兰附近的荷兰种植园亦被游击队所破坏。
    【新华社北平二十二日电】海牙讯：荷共真理报二十日刊载关于爪哇岛上荷兰集中营中可怖情况的消息称：“成千上万的印尼人民正在被禁闭中，其中许多人已被荷兰殖民者法庭处死。集中营的空气甚至比以前希特勒的死亡营还坏。一间不通空气的屋子里关了成百的犯人。他们都被酷热与饥饿带至死亡的边缘。这些受苦者每天只得一把米度日。犯人没有足够的水喝”。消息的结语称：荷兰政府正使用这种办法在印尼建立所谓“太平与秩序”。
