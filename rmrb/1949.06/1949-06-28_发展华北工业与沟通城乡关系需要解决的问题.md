    Problems to be Solved in Developing North China's Industry and Connecting Urban and Rural Relations
    Yao Yilin, Minister of Industry and Commerce of the North China People's Government
    Since the liberation of Tianjin and Beiping, there has been an upward trend in the industry of these two cities. According to the statistics of industry in Tianjin and Beiping, the current industrial production level has reached and surpassed the level of August 19th last year when the Kuomintang implemented price controls, and it is continuing to develop. During this period, in addition to many state-owned factories such as Zhongfang and Tianjin Steel Plant having achieved significant production results, the private industries that have recovered faster are the iron industry, cotton textile industry, match industry, and other industries and handicrafts needed by the vast number of farmers in rural areas. From the certain recovery achievements of Tianjin and Beiping's industry during this period, it can be explained that under the Chinese Communist Party's policy of protecting and developing national industry and commerce, when our tariff policy blocks the commodity invasion of foreign imperialism, and when urban-rural exchanges gradually develop, our industry will be developed. In particular, the manufacturing industries of production materials and daily necessities urgently needed by the vast number of farmers can be greatly developed.
    Since the liberation of Tianjin and Beiping, the inland industry of the North China region is in the process of reorganization. Among them, some handicrafts closely related to the war, such as the nitrate production industry in rural areas, have begun to decline. Some handicrafts, such as manual textile industry, salt manufacturing industry, and manual cigarette rolling industry, have reduced their production scale due to the competition of urban industrial products. But on the other hand, some new industrial handicrafts are gradually growing, such as the egg-beating industry, pig bristle sorting industry, straw hat braid weaving industry, and flour industry. These industrial handicrafts are suitable for export needs and supply urban needs, and will maintain a trend of continued upward development in the future.
    Currently, we are facing a season between the end of one harvest and the beginning of the next. Due to the poor wheat harvest this year, there is a shortage of food in rural areas, and the purchasing power of rural areas is very low; therefore, a situation of slow sales of some industrial products in urban and rural areas has been created. It is estimated that this situation may improve after the autumn harvest this year.
    However, at present, we still have many problems to solve in developing urban industry and connecting urban and rural relations:
    First, the current urban-rural exchange relationship is not completely normal, and there are still many unnecessary restrictions in some areas. For example, some areas still implement a certificate system that restricts the circulation of goods. In some areas, in order to prevent price fluctuations from affecting the local area, they implement measures that are harmful to the exchange of goods in market management, such as prohibiting purchases or sales. The starting point for implementing these measures in these areas is to prevent price fluctuations in other areas from affecting the areas under their management, but they do not understand that their purpose is impossible to achieve. Because the entire North China region has now been completely liberated, the transportation within the North China region and between the North China region and neighboring friendly regions is smooth, the currency has been unified, and the price issue is a comprehensive issue rather than one that any region can solve independently. With the natural trend of commodity circulation, goods from areas with low prices will inevitably flow to areas with high prices, and funds from areas with high prices will inevitably flow to areas with low prices. If various artificial obstacles are added, it is not only impossible to achieve the goal of stabilizing prices, but it may also stimulate greater fluctuations. Therefore, in order to develop our industry, the first problem at present is to make urban-rural exchanges smoother, to abolish certificate systems that hinder the exchange of goods such as purchase certificates and transportation certificates, and to allow free trade within the North China region and between the North China region and neighboring friendly regions. Local authorities should provide necessary assistance to legitimate merchants who purchase raw materials for industry, promote finished products, and purchase export goods. Market management is needed, but the purpose of market management is to facilitate transactions between merchants and the people, and to oppose speculation and manipulation. All illegal activities such as hoarding, speculation, and selling short should be restricted, but all legitimate commercial transactions should be encouraged.
    Second, to develop industry, it is necessary to restore and increase the purchasing power of farmers, because 80 percent of North China is farmers. Therefore, the increase in the purchasing power of farmers has a certain decisive effect on the recovery and development of industry. At present, the farmers in the liberated areas of North China have been allocated land, and they have been liberated from the oppression of the feudal and semi-feudal land system, but they still need more help so that they can invest more in the land and restore and develop the rural economy that has been destroyed by the enemy, puppet, and Kuomintang reactionaries for many years. In addition to the reduction and exemption of war service burdens, appropriate reduction of agricultural taxes, and the development of water conservancy, which are already being planned by the relevant departments, the trade organs in the North China region should also consider and effectively solve the following two problems:
    (1) How to strive for the large-scale export of surplus materials from farmers, overcome the many difficulties in current exports, reduce export taxes, support export commerce, and improve export quality, on the one hand, in order to obtain more foreign exchange, and more importantly, in order to effectively help the recovery and development of the urban and rural economy. The task of state trade organs in this regard should be to try to increase export figures as much as possible, overcome the purely profit-making viewpoint, and try to enable urban and rural people to obtain more income from exports.
    (2) At present, there are still some handicrafts in rural areas that need to be supported. State trade organs and supply and marketing cooperatives must support handicrafts so that farmers can smoothly overcome difficulties during the current season between the end of one harvest and the beginning of the next, which is also helping them to expand production this winter and next spring. Since the liberation of Tianjin and Beiping, due to the heavy workload, insufficient funds of state trade organs, and the initial establishment of the general supply and marketing cooperative with its lower-level organizations not yet widespread, this point of supporting rural handicrafts has been relaxed, so that some handicraft products that farmers can sell have not found a market, which is not conducive to helping farmers overcome difficulties and increase purchasing power.
    In order to develop industry and agriculture and smooth urban-rural exchanges, the current urban idle funds should be absorbed into industrial and legitimate commercial activities. The form of public-private cooperative organizations such as the wheat purchase and sales committee recently adopted in Tianjin and Beiping is worth studying and promoting, and more public-private cooperative forms can be continuously researched and created in supporting production, operating import and export, and purchasing raw materials and promoting finished products. This form will help our economy develop further.

　　发展华北工业与沟通城乡关系需要解决的问题
    华北人民政府工商部部长  姚依林
    平津解放后平津工业是向上发展的趋势。从平津工业统计来看，现在平津工业生产水平已达到并超过去年八一九国民党实施限价时的水平，而且还在继续向前发展，在此期间，除了许多国营工厂如中纺、天津炼钢厂等已取得显著生产成绩外，在私人工业中，恢复较快的是铁工业，棉纺织业，火柴工业，以及其他为农村中广大农民所需要的工业和手工业，从这一时期平津工业获得一定的恢复成绩来看，可以说明在中国共产党保护与发展民族工商业政策之下，当我们的关税政策挡住了外国帝国主义的商品侵略，当城乡交流逐渐发展时，我们的工业是会得到发展的。特别是为广大农民所迫切需要的生产资料与生活资料的制造业，更能得到广大的发展。
    平津解放后，华北区内地工业正在改组过程中，其中有一些与战争密切连系的手工业，如农村中的制硝业，已经开始衰落，有一些手工业如手工纺织业，制盐业，手工卷烟业都受到城市工业品的竞争而缩小了生产规模，但在另一方面有一些新的工业手工业，正在逐渐生长中，例如打蛋业，猪鬃整理业，草帽辫编织业，面粉业等。这些工业手工业是适合于出口需要和供应城市需要的，今后也将保持继续向上发展的趋势。
    目前正面临着青黄不接季节，由于今年小麦歉收，农村粮食缺少，农村购买力很低；因此造成目前城乡一部分工业产品滞销的情况，这种情况在今年秋收后估计可能改善。
    但目前我们在发展城市工业和沟通城乡关系上还有不少问题需要解决：
    第一、目前城乡交流关系还不完全正常，有许多地区尚存在着不必要的限制。例如在有些地区还施行限制物资流转的证照制度，在有些地区为了怕物价波动影响本区，因此在市场管理上施行了对物资交流有害的禁止购买或禁止出卖的办法。实行这些办法的地区，他们的出发点是为了防止别的地区物价波动波及他们所管理的地区，但是他们不了解他们的目的是不可能实现的。因为现在华北全区已完全解放，华北区内部及华北区与各友邻区之间交通已经畅达，货币已经统一，物价问题已经是全面问题而不是任何一个地区所能单独解决的问题。随着物资流转的自然趋势，物价低的地区的物资必然会流向物价高的地区，物价高的地区的资金必然会流向物价低的地区，如果加以各种人为阻碍不仅不可能达到平稳物价目的，而且可能刺激更大的波动。因此，为了发展我们的工业，目前第一问题就是要使城乡交流更加顺畅，要取消购买证、运输证这一类阻碍物资交流的证照制度，要准许华北区内部以及华北区与各友邻区之间的自由贸易。各地对于为工业采购原料推销成品和采购出口物资的正当商人，应给予必要的帮助。市场管理工作是需要的，但是市场管理的目的是为了便利商民成交，反对投机操纵。对于一切囤积居奇，投机倒把买空卖空等非法行为应加以限制，但是对一切正当商业成交则应加以鼓励。
    第二、要发展工业必须要恢复与提高农民购买力，因为华北百分之八十是农民，因此农民购买力的提高，对于工业恢复发展有一定的决定作用，目前华北解放区农民已分得土地，他们已从封建半封建的土地制度压迫下解放出来，但还需要给他们以更多帮助，才能使他们以更多力量投资在土地上，使遭受敌伪与国民党反动派多年破坏的农村经济得以恢复发展。除了减免战勤负担，适当减轻农业税收，发展水利等问题已经由各有关部门正在计划外，在华北区的贸易机关还应考虑切实解决以下两个问题：
    （一）如何能争取农民剩余物资大量出口，克服目前出口中的许多困难，减免出口税收，扶助出口商业，提高出口质量，一方面为了取得较多外汇，更重要的是为了有效的帮助城乡经济的恢复发展。国家贸易机关在这一方面的任务应是尽量争取增加出口数字，克服单纯营利观点，尽量争取使城乡人民在出口中能取得更多的收入。
    （二）目前农村还有一些手工业需要扶植。国家贸易机关及供销合作社必须扶植手工业，使目前青黄不接时农民能顺利渡过困难，这样也就是帮助他们在今冬和明春能扩大生产。自从平津解放以来，由于工作任务的繁重，国家贸易机关资金不足，供销合作总社组织初建，下层组织还不普遍，对于扶助农村手工业这一点是放松了的，使得农民有些可以推销出去的手工业产品没有找到销路，这样对于帮助农民渡过困难及提高购买力都是不利的。
    为了发展工业和农业，畅通城乡交流，应把现在城市游资吸收到工业和正当商业活动中来，最近平津所采取的小麦购销委员会这一类的公私合作组织形式是值得研究和推广的，并且在扶助生产上，在经营进出口上，在采购原料和推销成品上还可以继续研究和创造更多的公私合作形式，这种形式会帮助我们的经济更向前发展。
