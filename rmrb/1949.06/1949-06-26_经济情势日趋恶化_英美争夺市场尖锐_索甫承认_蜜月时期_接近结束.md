Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, June 25th: According to reports from American and French news agencies, Assistant Secretary of State for Economic Affairs, Thorp, admitted in a public speech on the 23rd that the increasingly deteriorating economic situation in the United States and Britain has intensified the struggle for world markets between capitalist countries, particularly between Britain and the United States. Thorp said: "The honeymoon period in post-war international economic relations is now nearing its end. Hostility and conflict in world trade are beginning to emerge again, and market competition is becoming more acute."

Thorp could not conceal the opposition caused by the United States' support for Japan and Germany to seize markets from Britain and other capitalist countries. He said: "The United States' efforts to help Germany and Japan become 'self-reliant' conflict with the desires of those countries that hope to prevent these two countries from making a comeback in foreign trade." He predicted that the "later stages of the implementation of the Marshall Plan will pose a much greater threat to international goodwill (referring to 'US aid') than the initial stages."

Thorp expressed great dissatisfaction with the British-Argentine economic agreement, saying: "Certain countries and interest groups are striving to occupy certain specific markets and exclude competitors. We are witnessing the conclusion of some bilateral agreements, the purpose of which is to guarantee certain countries a stable market."

  　英美争夺市场尖锐
    索甫承认“蜜月时期”接近结束
    【新华社北平二十五日电】据美法通讯社报道，掌管经济事务的美国助理国务卿索甫，二十三日在公开演说中承认，由于美英两国经济情势的益趋恶化，已使资本主义各国特别是英美之间争夺世界市场的斗争日益尖锐。索甫说：“战后国际经济关系上的蜜月时期，现正接近结束，世界贸易上的敌对与冲突，又开始在出现，市场竞争正变得更加尖锐。”
    索甫无法掩饰美国扶植日本与德国以夺取英国及其他资本主义国家市场所引起的反对。他说：“美国帮助德国与日本‘自立’的努力，与那些希望阻止这两国在对外贸易上卷土重来的国家的愿望相冲突。”他预言马歇尔计划“推行的后期阶段，对于国际善意（按指‘美援’）的威胁作用，要比初期大得多”。
    对于英国和阿根廷经济协定，索甫表示极大不满，他说：“某些国家和利益集团竭力占取某些特定的市场和排斥竞争者。我们目击一些双边协定的缔结，这些协定的目的是给某些国家保证稳固的市场”。
