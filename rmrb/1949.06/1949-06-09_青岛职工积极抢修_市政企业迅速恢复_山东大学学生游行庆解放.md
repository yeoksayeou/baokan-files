Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, 8th: After the liberation of Qingdao, municipal enterprises throughout the city rapidly recovered. This is the result of the hard work of workers and staff in these industries after liberation. On the day of liberation, workers at the Telecommunications Bureau, regardless of the fatigue from protecting the factory for several days, immediately organized forces to go to areas thirty miles away to repair lines destroyed by artillery fire, enabling telephone service within and outside the city to be restored by the afternoon of the day of liberation. Workers at the Electric Light Company persisted in the struggle to protect the factory during the war surrounding Qingdao, ensuring that the whole city was brightly lit on the evening of liberation, and the next day the city's power supply returned to normal. The water plant's supply to some areas of the city was temporarily disrupted because important water pipes at two water sources were destroyed by artillery fire and there was insufficient power. However, through the efforts of the workers, the city's water supply was fully restored by the morning of the 4th. The Qingdao-Chengyang section of the Jiaoji Railway was also opened to traffic on the 3rd thanks to the repairs made by railway workers.

Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, 8th: Students of Shandong University in Qingdao held a grand parade the day after the liberation of Qingdao (the 3rd) to celebrate the liberation of Qingdao and to express their appreciation to the People's Liberation Army. The students proudly carried a huge portrait of Chairman Mao, secretly painted before the liberation, measuring eight feet long and five feet wide, and enthusiastically sang the songs they had secretly learned long ago: "You are the lighthouse, illuminating the ocean of dawn..." They raised their arms along the way and shouted slogans such as "Long live Chairman Mao!" "Long live the People's Liberation Army!" Workers, students, and citizens along the way automatically joined the parade. The highlands, walls, building terraces, and windows along the streets were crowded with people. People who had long been oppressed by American imperialism and the Kuomintang reactionaries looked up to their savior, Chairman Mao's portrait, with infinite respect. The students also carried out propaganda work in the streets, performing the "Great Unity of Workers, Peasants, Soldiers, Students, and Merchants" Yangge dance, explaining the "Eight Points of Attention" of the People's Liberation Army to the citizens, and posting various bright and eye-catching slogans.

　　青岛职工积极抢修　市政企业迅速恢复
  　山东大学学生游行庆解放
    【新华社济南八日电】青岛解放后，全市市政企业迅速恢复，这是各该业工人职员在解放后努力工作的结果。电讯局工人于解放当天即不顾数日来护厂的疲劳，马上组织力量赴三十里路以外的地区修理被炮火击毁的线路，使市内外电话得于解放当日午后即告恢复。电灯公司工人在青岛外围战争中始终坚持护厂斗争，使解放当晚全市即大放光明，第二日全市电力供应即恢复常态。自来水厂因两水源地的重要水管被炮火摧毁，及电力供应不足，致对市内某些地区曾一度未能输水。但经工人努力，至四日晨，全市供水已全部恢复。胶济线青市至城阳段也在铁路工人抢修下于三日通车。
    【新华社济南八日电】青岛山东大学学生，于青岛解放次日（三日）举行盛大游行，庆祝青岛解放与慰问人民解放军。同学们高举在解放前秘密绘制的八尺长五尺宽的毛主席巨像，并纵情地高唱着他们早就秘密学会了的歌曲：“你是灯塔，照耀着黎明的海洋……”他们沿途振臂高呼“毛主席万岁！”“解放军万岁！”等口号。沿途的工人、学生、市民都自动参加进游行行列。街道两旁的高地上、墙头上、楼房的露台上、窗里都挤满了人。长期在美帝国主义和国民党反动派压迫下的人民，都以无限的尊敬仰望自己的救星——毛主席的肖像。同学们并在街头进行宣传工作，演出了“工农兵学商大团结”的秧歌舞，向市民讲解了人民解放军“约法八章”，贴出各种鲜艳夺目的标语。
