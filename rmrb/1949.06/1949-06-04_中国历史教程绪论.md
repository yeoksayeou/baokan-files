    (C) "The second characteristic of production is that changes and developments in production always begin with changes and developments in the productive forces, and first of all with changes and developments in the instruments of production. Therefore, the productive forces are the most active and most revolutionary element in production. Initially, the social productive forces undergo changes and development, and then the relations of production and the economic relations of the people change and develop in accordance with and in adaptation to these changes. But this does not mean that the relations of production do not affect the development of the productive forces, or that the productive forces do not depend on the relations of production. Although the relations of production develop depending on the development of the productive forces, they in turn affect the productive forces, accelerating or delaying their development. And it must be pointed out that the relations of production cannot lag excessively behind the growth of the productive forces and contradict this growth, because only when the relations of production are suitable for the nature and condition of the productive forces and allow the productive forces to develop can the productive forces be developed to the fullest extent. Therefore, no matter how far the relations of production lag behind the development of the productive forces, sooner or later they should and certainly will adapt to the level of development of the productive forces, suitable for the nature of the productive forces. Otherwise, there will be a fundamental disruption of the unity of the productive forces and the relations of production in the production system, a collapse of all production, a production crisis, and a destruction of the productive forces.
    Examples of the unsuitability of the relations of production to the nature of the productive forces, and examples of conflicts between the two, are the economic crises that occur in capitalist countries, where the capitalist private ownership of the means of production is extremely unsuitable for the public nature of the production process and for the nature of the productive forces. The result of this unsuitability is an economic crisis that leads to the destruction of the productive forces, and this unsuitability is the economic basis of the social revolution, which is charged with the mission of destroying the existing relations of production and establishing relations of production suitable for the nature of the productive forces.
    Conversely, an example of the complete suitability of the relations of production to the nature of the productive forces is the socialist national economy of the Soviet Union, where the public ownership of the means of production and the public nature of the production process are perfectly suited, so there is no economic crisis or destruction of the productive forces in the Soviet Union.
    Therefore, the productive forces are not only the most active and most revolutionary element in production, but also the decisive element in the development of production.
    What the productive forces are, so should the relations of production be.
    The condition of the productive forces answers the question of what kind of instruments of production people use to produce the material resources they need, while the condition of the relations of production answers the question of who owns the means of production (land, forests, water, mineral resources, raw materials, instruments of production, production buildings, transportation and communication tools, etc.), who controls the means of production – whether it is controlled by the whole society, or by individual people, groups, and classes and used to exploit other people, groups, and classes.
    The following is a general picture of the development of the productive forces from ancient times to the present. The transition from crude stone tools to bows and arrows, and in accordance with this, the transition from hunting life to the domestication of animals and primitive animal husbandry; the transition from stone tools to metal tools (iron axes, iron hoes, etc.), and in accordance with this, the transition to planting plants, the transition to agriculture; the continued improvement of metal manufacturing tools, the transition to iron smelting bellows, the transition to pottery production, and in accordance with this, the development of handicraft industry, the separation of handicraft industry from agriculture, independent handicraft production, and the development of handicraft workshop production; the transition from handicraft production tools to machines, the transformation of handicraft workshop production into machine industry; and then the transition to machine-made. and the emergence of modern mechanized industry—this is a rough and far from complete picture of the development of social productive forces in human history. At the same time, the development and improvement of production tools is of course realized by the people participating in production, and is not unrelated to people, so, due to the changes and development of production tools, people, that is, the most important element in the productive forces, also change and develop accordingly, their production experience, labor skills, and the ability to use production tools also change and develop accordingly." (History of the CPSU, pp. 154-156)
    Some Chinese historians do not understand that the changes and development of people are accompanied by the changes and development of production tools, and that the development of science and skills is accompanied by the development of production experience. On the contrary, they use the views of fatalism and idealism to say: "Heaven is clever" "Those who make it, rule; those who teach it, lead." They attribute the driving force of social evolution to a few sages. And as Mencius said: "Those who labor with their minds govern others; those who labor with their strength are governed by others. Those who are governed by others feed them; those who govern others are fed by them. This is a universal principle." This has rationalized the system of exploitation and has moved further away from the truth of social development.
    "As social productive forces change and develop historically, so too do the relations of production, the economic relations of people, change and develop in accordance with them.
    There are five basic relations of production in history: primitive commune system, slave system, feudal system, capitalist system, and socialist system.
    Under the primitive commune system, the basis of the relations of production is the public ownership of the means of production. This is basically in line with the nature of the productive forces at that time. Stone tools and later bows and arrows made it absolutely impossible for people to fight against the forces of nature and wild beasts on their own. At that time, in order to gather fruits in the forest, catch fish in the water, and build some kind of dwelling, people had to work together, otherwise they would starve to death or become victims of wild beasts or neighboring tribes. Common labor also led to the public ownership of the means of production and products. Here, there was no knowledge of private ownership of the means of production, but some of the production tools used to defend against wild beasts were owned by individuals. There was no exploitation here, and there were no classes.
    Under the slave system, the basis of the relations of production is that slave owners own the means of production and own the production workers, who are slaves that slave owners can buy, sell, slaughter like livestock. Such relations of production are basically in line with the state of the productive forces at that time. At this time, people possessed not stone tools, but metal tools; at this time, what existed was not that kind of greedy, primitive hunting economy that did not know what animal husbandry was, or what agriculture was, but animal husbandry, agriculture, handicraft industry and the division of labor between these production sectors had already appeared; at this time, it was possible to exchange products between individuals and between tribes, it was possible to accumulate wealth in the hands of a few people, and to truly accumulate the means of production in the hands of a few people, it was possible to force the majority of people to submit to the minority of people and turn this majority of people into slaves. Here, it was no longer a question of all members of society laboring together and freely in the production process, but rather the forced labor of slaves exploited by the slave owners who gained without labor occupied a major position. Therefore, there was no longer public ownership of the means of production and products. It had been replaced by private ownership. Here, the slave owner was the first and basic thorough private owner.
    Rich and poor, exploiters and exploited, those who enjoyed full rights and those who had no rights, their cruel class struggle with each other – this was the scene of the slave system.
    Under the feudal system, the basis of the relations of production is that feudal lords own the means of production and do not completely own the production workers, who are serfs that feudal lords can no longer slaughter, but can still buy and sell. At that time, in addition to feudal ownership, there was also individual ownership of production tools and private economies by peasants and handicraftsmen based on their own labor. Such relations of production are basically in line with the state of the productive forces at that time. The further improvement of iron smelting and iron making work; the distribution of iron plows and weaving machines; the continued development of agriculture, horticulture, winemaking, and oil refining; and the emergence of handicraft workshops coexisting with handicraft workshops – these were the characteristics of the state of the productive forces at that time.
    What the new productive forces needed was producers who could demonstrate some kind of autonomy in production, were willing to work, and felt interested in labor. Therefore, the feudal lords abandoned the slaves, because the slaves were workers who were not interested in labor and had no autonomy at all; and preferred to use serfs, because the serfs had their own economy, their own production tools, and had a certain labor interest necessary for cultivating the land and taking out a portion of the produce from their own harvest to pay to the feudal lords.
    Private ownership had continued to develop here. Exploitation was still almost as cruel as exploitation under the slave system, but it was slightly reduced. The class struggle between exploiters and exploited was the basic feature of the feudal system. (To be continued)

  　二、研究中国历史的方法（续十）
    （丙）“生产的第二个特点就在生产的变更和发展始终是从生产力的变更和发展上，首先是从生产工具的变更和发展上开始。所以生产力是生产中最活动最革命的要素。起初是社会的生产力发生变更和发展起来，然后，人们的生产关系，人们的经济关系也依赖于这些变更并与这些变更相适应而发生变更。但这并不是说，生产关系不影响到生产力的发展，生产力不依赖于生产关系。生产关系虽然是依赖于生产力的发展而发展，但同时它们又反转来影响到生产力，加速或延缓其发展。而且必须指出：生产关系不能过分长久落后于生产力的增长并和这一增长相矛盾，因为只有当生产关系适合于生产力的性质及状况，并使生产力有发展余地时，生产力才能尽量发展起来。因此，无论生产关系怎样落后于生产力的发展，但它们迟早总应而且一定会去适合于生产力的发展水准，适合于生产力的性质。不然，便会有生产体系中生产力与生产关系统一的根本破坏，全部生产破裂，生产危机以及生产力破坏的情形。
    生产关系和生产力性质不适合的实例，它们两者间冲突的实例，便是资本主义国家中所发生的经济危机，那里生产资料的资本主义私有制是和生产过程的公共性质，是和生产力的性质极不适合的。这种不适合的结果，便是使生产力陷于破坏的经济危机，而这种不适合的情况就是那负有使命破坏现存生产关系，并建立起适合于生产力性质的生产关系的社会革命的经济基础。
    反之，生产关系和生产力性质完全适合的实例，便是苏联的社会主义国民经济，这里的生产资料的公有制和生产过程的公共性质是完全适合的，因此在苏联没有经济危机，也没有生产力破坏的情形。
    所以，生产力不仅是生产中最活动最革命的要素，而且是生产发展过程中决定的要素。
    生产力怎样，生产关系也就应怎样。
    生产力的状况所回答的是人们用怎样的生产工具来生产他们所必需的物质资料的问题，而生产关系的状况所回答的则是生产资料（土地、森林、水流、矿源、、原料、生产工具、生产建筑物、交通联络工具等等）归谁所有，生产资料由谁支配——是由全社会支配，还是由单个的人，集团和阶级支配并利用去剥削其他的人，集团和阶级的问题。
    以下便是从古代到今日的生产力发展的一般情景。由粗笨的石器过渡到弓箭，并与此相适应而由狩猎生活过渡到驯养动物和原始畜牧；由石器过渡到金属工具（铁斧、铁口锄等等），并与此相适应而过渡到种植植物，过渡到农业；金属的制造工具继续改良，过渡到冶铁风箱，过渡到陶器生产，并与此相适应而有手工业的发展，手工业脱离农业的分立，独立手工业生产以及从来手工业工场生产的发展；由手工业生产工具过渡到机器，手工业工场生产转变为机器工业；再进而过渡到机器制。以及现代机器化工业的出现，——这就是人类史上社会生产力发展的一个大致而远不完备的情景。同时，生产工具的发展和改善当然是由参加生产的人们所实现，而不是与人们无关，所以，由于生产工具的变更和发展，人们，即生产力中最重要的原素，也随着变更和发展起来，他们的生产经验，劳动技能以及运用生产工具的本领，也随着变更和发展起来。”（联共党史，一五四——一五六页）
    中国有些历史家，不了解人们的变化与发展，是伴着生产工具的变化与发展而来，科学与技能的发展是伴着生产经验的发展而发展，反而以天命论，唯心论的观点说：“天＠聪明”“作之君，作之师。”把社会进化的动力归之于少数圣贤。并且如孟子所谓：“劳心者治人，劳力者治于人，治于人者食人，治人者食于人，天下之通义也。”曾使剥削制度合理化而离社会发展的真理更远了。
    “随着社会生产力在历史上变更和发展，于是人们的生产关系，人们的经济关系，也与此适应而变更和发展。
    历史上有五种基本生产关系：原始公社制的，奴隶制的，封建制的，资本主义的，社会主义的。
    在原始公社制度下，生产关系的基础是生产资料的公有制。这在基本上是与当时的生产力性质相合的。石器以及后来出现的弓箭，使人绝对不能单身去和自然界势力及猛兽作斗争。人们当时为要在森林中采集果实，在水里捕获鱼类，建筑某种住所，便不得不共同工作，否则便会饿死，便会成为猛兽或邻近部落的牺牲品。公共的劳动也就引起了生产资料和生产品的公有制。这里还不知道什么是生产资料私有制，而不过有些同时用以防御猛兽的生产工具是归个人所有。这里并没有什么剥削，也没有什么阶级。
    在奴隶制度下，生产关系的基础是奴隶主占有生产资料和占有生产工作者，这生产工作者便是奴隶主所能当作牲畜来买卖屠杀的奴隶。这样的生产关系在基本上是与当时的生产力状况相合的。此时人们所拥有的已经不是石器，而是金属工具；此时所有的已不是那种不知畜牧业为何物，也不知农业为何物的贪乏原始的狩猎经济，而是已经出现了的畜牧业，农业，手工业以及这些生产部门彼此间的分工；此时已有可能在各个人间和各部落间交换生产品，已有可能把财富积累在少数人手中，而且真正把生产资料积累于少数人手中，已有可能迫使大多数人服从少数人并把这大多数人变为奴隶。这里已不是社会中一切成员在生产过程中共同地和自由地劳动，而是由那些被不劳而获的奴隶主所剥削的奴隶们的强迫劳动占主要地位。因此也就没有了生产资料和生产品的公有制。它已被私有制所代替了。这里，奴隶主是第一个和基本的十足的私有主。
    富人和穷人，剥削者和被剥削者，享有完全权利的人和毫无权利的人，他们彼此间的残酷阶级斗争，——这就是奴隶制度的情景。
    在封建制度下，生产关系的基础是封建主占有生产资料和不完全占有生产工作者，这生产工作者便是封建主虽已不能屠杀，但仍可以买卖的农奴。当时除封建所有制外，还存在有农民和手工业者以本身劳动为基础占有生产工具和自己私有经济的个人所有制。这样的生产关系在基本上是与当时的生产力状况相合的。溶铁和制铁工作更进一步的改善；铁犁和织布车的散布；农业，园圃业，酿酒业和炼油业的继续发展；与手工业作坊并存的手工业工场企业的出现。——这就是当时生产力状况的特征。
    新的生产力所需要的是在生产中能表现某种自动性，愿意劳动，对劳动感觉兴趣的生产者。因此，封建主就把奴隶抛弃，因为奴隶是对劳动不感兴趣和完全没有自动性的工作者；而宁愿利用农奴，因为农奴有自己的经济，有自己的生产工具，具有为耕种土地并从自己收成中拿出一部分实物缴给封建主所必需的某种劳动兴趣。
    私有制在这里已经继续发展了。剥削几乎仍如奴隶制度下的剥削一样残酷，不过是稍许减轻一些罢了。剥削者和被剥削者间的阶级斗争，便是封建制度的基本特征。（未完）
