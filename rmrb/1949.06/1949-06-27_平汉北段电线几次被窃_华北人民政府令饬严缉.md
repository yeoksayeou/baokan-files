　　Several Thefts of Power Lines on the Northern Section of the Pinghan Railway
  　North China People's Government Orders Strict Apprehension
    [News from this newspaper] The North China People's Government reports that the telephone and telegraph lines on the northern section of the Pinghan Railway, between Beiping and Changxindian, and between Liulihe and Zhuozhou, have recently been stolen several times. The above-mentioned lines are located on the main routes of the Ping-Shi and Ping-Bao lines, and are crucial hubs for north-south communication, so they must be effectively protected. The government has ordered local governments along the routes to cooperate with local garrisons to strictly apprehend and bring to justice all bandits and thieves who intentionally sabotage communication or steal and sell [the lines].
