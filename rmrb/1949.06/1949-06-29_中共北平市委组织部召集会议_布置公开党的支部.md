　　CCP Beiping Municipal Committee Organization Department Convenes Meeting
  　Arranges for Publicizing Party Branches
    [Beiping City News] The Organization Department of the CCP Beiping Municipal Committee convened meetings on the 22nd and 26th of this month, respectively, gathering branch secretaries from various factories, universities, and district middle schools in the city to discuss the issue of publicizing Party branches. At the first plenary meeting of all Party members after the liberation of Beiping, the Municipal Committee raised the issue of publicizing the Party. However, due to the social order not being fully stable at that time, a large number of Kuomintang secret agents were lying dormant, and scattered soldiers and vagrants had just begun to be taken in. At the same time, some Party members were deeply involved with underground Party organizations in Shanghai, Nanjing, and other places. Therefore, at that time, the Party organizations in various factories, especially schools, were not fully publicized to work under the supervision of the masses. Only some street branches and some small factory branch members were publicized, such as in the Fourth and Fifth Districts of the city, and the response after publicizing was very good. However, Party members in factories and schools took a negative attitude towards publicizing the Party due to various unnecessary concerns, such as fear of exposing secrets, fear of being considered inadequate by the masses, fear of being looked down upon by the masses, and so on. Now, the conditions for publicizing Party branches and members are even more fully met. Therefore, the Municipal Committee has decided that all Party branches in factories and schools in the city that have not yet been publicized should be publicized immediately. This is a movement of great significance for improving the work style of Party members and strengthening the ties between the Party and the masses. Publicizing the Party not only makes it easier for Party members to improve under the supervision of the masses and for the Party to maintain its purity, but it also makes it easier to connect with the masses, directly publicize the Party's policies, and more easily take the lead and advance with the masses, driving overall work. This will play a promoting role in overcoming the phenomenon of some branches or Party members in factories and schools being detached from the masses and in launching the democratization movement of factory management. After the Municipal Committee's arrangement, Party branch members in the following factories have been publicized: Fourth Garment Factory, General Branch of the Telecommunications Bureau, First Electrical Repair Factory of the Fourth Institute of Beiping Machine Company, Post Office, Beiping Branch of North China Electric Power Company, People's Printing Factory, Tram Company, and Water Company, among other units. Party branch members in the following schools have been fully publicized: Peking University, Fu Jen Catholic University, Railway Institute, Tsinghua University, and Advanced Institute of Technology, among others.

　　中共北平市委组织部召集会议
  　布置公开党的支部
    【平市讯】中共北平市委组织部，于本月二十二日、二十六日分别召集市内各工厂、各大学、各区中学支部书记开会，讨论了党的支部公开问题。北平解放后的第一次全体党员大会上，市委即提出了公开党的问题，但因当时社会秩序尚未完全稳定，国民党特务大部潜伏起来，散兵游勇刚刚开始收容，同时有些党员与沪宁等地之地下党牵连颇多，因此当时各工厂特别是学校的党的组织，未能全部公开出来放在群众监督之下工作，仅一部分街道支部和一些小工厂的支部党员公开了，如本市四区、五区，而公开以后反映很好，但工厂学校中的党员却以种种不应有的顾虑，而不敢公开，如怕暴露秘密，怕群众说自己差，怕群众看不起等等，因此，对公开党采取了消极的态度。现在党的支部和党员的公开条件就更充分具备了，所以市委决定市内各工厂学校的支部尚未公开的应即一律公开；这对于改善党员的作风，密切党与群众的联系，是具有重大意义的一个运动。党的公开，不仅是使党员在群众的监督下容易进步，使党更易保持纯洁，同时也会更容易联系群众，直接宣传党的政策，更便于带头和群众一道前进，带动全面工作。这对克服目前工厂学校中的一部分支部或党员脱离群众的现象，和展开工厂管理民主化运动，将会发生推进的作用。在市委布置后工厂支部党员公开的，已经有被服四厂、电讯局总支部、北平机器公司第四所第一电机修配厂、邮政局、华北电业公司北平分公司、人民印制厂、电车公司、自来水公司等单位。学校支部党员完全公开的已有北大、辅大、铁院、清华、高工等校。（国涌）
