　　[Chahar News] In Beigaolei Village, Xingtang Seventh District, forty-three women completed the sowing of forty-six mu of early-maturing crops. Fengzi's family of four, with three children and thirteen mu of land, did everything themselves, without relying on men, including hauling manure, driving carts, weeding, and watering. The model military dependents in Beijian Village, Second District, hauled over two hundred cartloads of soil themselves last winter. This spring, the wheat has already been watered twice. Under her influence, most of the women in the village have participated in agricultural production.
