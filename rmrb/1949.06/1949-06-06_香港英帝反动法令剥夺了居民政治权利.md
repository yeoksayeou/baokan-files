　　Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 5th - The British government in Hong Kong's Legislative Council, based on a temporary motion by the government's legal counsel, Lilifen, on May 25th, passed at first reading the "Societies Registration and Related Matters Ordinance" bill, which completely deprives residents of political rights. This ordinance is nominally to control "societies," but in reality, it is to control all patriotic Chinese people in Hong Kong. Because the ordinance stipulates that "if members of a society reside in Hong Kong or frequently appear in Hong Kong, or if anyone in Hong Kong handles or assists in handling such a society or collects money or membership fees on its behalf, then even if the society is formed outside Hong Kong and its headquarters or main office is located outside Hong Kong, the society will still be deemed to have been established in Hong Kong." Therefore, such individuals will still be subject to the control of this ordinance. The ordinance stipulates that any existing society in Hong Kong must apply for registration within thirty days from the date of implementation of the ordinance. If the Hong Kong government registrar believes that a society is related to or connected with a political organization or group established outside Hong Kong, he may refuse to register it. At the same time, if he believes that a society may be used for "illegal" purposes or for purposes detrimental to or incompatible with the so-called Hong Kong security, welfare, or order, he may also refuse to register it. For societies that have been registered or exempted from registration, the Hong Kong registrar may also order their dissolution at any time if he deems there are "sufficient reasons." The British registrar may at any time order societies exempted from registration or already registered to submit written reports on their organization, constitution, the names of the persons in charge residing in Hong Kong, and a list of society members, the number of meetings held in Hong Kong in the six months before the order was issued, the location of the meetings, and other information accurately to the British authorities. Societies refused registration by the British authorities and unregistered societies may be deemed "illegal societies" by the British authorities. The ordinance stipulates that any person in charge, manager, or assistant manager of a society deemed "illegal" may be fined up to three thousand Hong Kong dollars and imprisoned for up to three years; members and participants in meetings of these societies may be fined up to one thousand Hong Kong dollars and imprisoned for up to one year; even if they are not members of these societies, but allow these societies to hold meetings in their residences or properties, they may also be fined up to one thousand Hong Kong dollars and imprisoned for up to one year. The British authorities do not even need to prove that a "society" has a name to prosecute. If the British registrar or assistant registrar believes that a place is the office or meeting place of a society or any of its members, they may enter or forcibly enter at any time to search and arrest.

　　香港英帝反动法令剥夺了居民政治权利
    【新华社北平五日电】香港英国政府立法局于五月二十五日根据该政府律政司立利芬的临时动议，一读通过完全剥夺居民政治权利的“社团注册及有关事项条例”法案。该条例名义上是管制“社团”，实则是管制中国在香港的一切爱国人民，因为该条例规定“如有某社团的成员住在本港或常在港内出现，或本港内有任何人办理或协助办理此种社团或代征收金钱或会费，则该社团虽系在港外组成，其总部或主要办事处虽设在港外，该社团仍将被认为已在港内成立。”因而这种个人仍将受到该条例的管制。该条例规定香港现存的任何社团均须在条例实施之日起三十日以内申请注册。香港政府注册官如认为某社团与在香港以外成立的政治组织或集团有关或联系时，他即可拒绝予以注册；同时，如他认为某社团可能被用于“非法”目的或对所谓香港治安、福利或秩序不利或不相容的目的时，他也可拒绝予以注册。对于已注册或免注册的社团，香港注册官在自认“有充分理由”时，亦得随时下令予以解散。英国注册官可随时命令免注册或已注册社团，书面报告其组织、章程、居留香港的主持人及社团员名单、命令发出前六个月内在港开会次数、开会地点及其他情况确切报告英国当局。上述被英国当局拒绝注册的社团及未注册社团，英当局均可认其为“非法社团”。该条例规定对任何被认为“非法”的社团主持人、办理人或协助办理人得处以港币三千元以下的罚款及处以三年以下的监禁；对其成员及参加这些社团集会的人，得科以一千元以下的罚款及处以一年以下的监禁；即使不是这些社团的成员，但听任这些社团在其所住或所有房屋内集会者，亦得科以一千元以下的罚款和一年以下的监禁。英当局甚至不要证明某“社团”具有名称，即可进行控告。英国注册官或助理注册官如认为某处为某社团或其任何成员办公或开会地点，即可随时进入或强入，进行搜查及逮捕。
