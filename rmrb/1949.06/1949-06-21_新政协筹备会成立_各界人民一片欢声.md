【Special Dispatch from Our Newspaper】The news of the establishment of the Preparatory Committee of the New Political Consultative Conference has been announced, and everyone is anticipating and concerned about this news, thinking or expressing their opinions, supporting the established Preparatory Committee of the New Political Consultative Conference, and supporting the upcoming establishment of the coalition government. Yesterday (the 20th), our newspaper reporter made extensive contact with people from all walks of life, and now reports on some of their opinions below.

"It's the first time the Youth League has representatives participating in the CPPCC"

A responsible comrade from the Central Committee of the China New Democratic Youth League said: The convening of the Preparatory Committee of the New Political Consultative Conference is a major event in Chinese history. For many years, the youth of the country have fought heroically to overthrow the corrupt and reactionary rule and establish an independent and democratic New China. The far-reaching development prospects of Chinese youth have since had a more reliable guarantee. The establishment of the Preparatory Committee of the New Political Consultative Conference this time also includes representatives of the youth to attend, which is also a first in history. This shows that in the new democratic society, youth enjoy political rights that were not available in the old society, and our status has been raised to an unprecedented level. The Central Committee of the New Democratic Youth League will call on all members of the Youth League and patriotic youth across the country to warmly support this New Political Consultative Conference of great historical significance.

"This meeting symbolizes the liberation of women throughout the country"

The All-China Democratic Women's Federation believes that the upcoming New Political Consultative Conference is a historic creation in political significance. It includes all parties, people's organizations, and the People's Liberation Army, representing a broad mass base. The six representatives of the All-China Democratic Women's Federation participating in the conference represent more than 22.6 million organized women. Everything at the meeting has been democratically negotiated and successfully passed. This meeting symbolizes the liberation of women throughout the country. But our responsibilities have become even heavier: to mobilize women across the country to fight to eliminate the Kuomintang reactionary remnants and build a New China.

"We are loyal supporters of the New CPPCC and the Democratic Coalition Government"

A unit of the Beiping Garrison Headquarters held group discussions at 3:00 p.m. yesterday (the 20th) on the great historical significance of the establishment of the Preparatory Committee of the New CPPCC. Xu Changli and others said: "The convening of the Preparatory Committee of the New CPPCC was not easy: how much blood did the soldiers shed at the front, and how much sweat did the people in the rear put in. The New CPPCC grew out of blood and sweat. We hope that the New CPPCC will be convened quickly to establish a coalition government, lead the Chinese people to work hard in production, turn China into an industrial country, enrich national defense, and make China as strong as steel, so that imperialism will not dare to infringe upon us. Our Chinese People's Liberation Army must always become the strong and invincible armed force of the Chinese people. We are loyal supporters of the New CPPCC and the Democratic Coalition Government."

"Workers were oppressed in the past because the regime was in the hands of a few bureaucratic capitalists"

Lu Mao, an old hero who participated in the "February 7th" general strike, was full of red light when he heard the news of the establishment of the Preparatory Committee of the New CPPCC. He is now a forger at the Sixth Institute of the 70th Arsenal. When the trade union was established in the factory in April after liberation, he was elected as the deputy director and director of the trade union office of the Sixth Institute. He said: "Workers were oppressed in the past because the regime was in the hands of a few bureaucratic capitalists." He pointed to the list of participants in the Preparatory Committee and the Standing Committee one by one and said: "You see, this New CPPCC does not have reactionary elements participating, and it was called and convened by our Communist Party Chairman Mao. The All-China Federation of Trade Unions has many representatives participating, which guarantees the leading role of the proletariat." He immediately suggested to the factory trade union that the news of the establishment of the Preparatory Committee of the New CPPCC in today's newspaper should be written on blackboards and big-character posters, and worker symposiums should also be held. He said: "This is a big deal, and every worker must know it."

Jin Xizhen, a sewing worker at the Beiping Garment Factory No. 2, wholeheartedly supports the Preparatory Committee of the New CPPCC and put forward several hopes. She said: After the New CPPCC is convened in the future and a coalition government is established, she hopes to help female workers do a good job in childcare, and appropriately solve their work and life problems for housewives and elderly female workers. Other issues such as the enrollment of workers' children and workers' medical care, she believes that the government will solve them well.

"The reactionaries persecuted us in the past, but today students also have representatives participating"

Yuan Hanqing, a professor at Peking University, said that the destruction of the reactionary regime and the establishment of the people's regime are the inevitable trend of history. The convening of the Preparatory Committee of the New CPPCC is a preparation for the establishment of a national people's regime. On the professor's side, everyone felt that the new CPPCC meeting would inevitably establish a national democratic coalition government. At that time, the development of higher education would definitely be able to proceed more smoothly. The professors all felt very excited, and everyone expressed their willingness to wholeheartedly support this epoch-making historical event.

Two thousand students in the Fifth and Sixth Battalions of the First Department of North China University were very happy to hear about the establishment of the Preparatory Committee of the New CPPCC. Chen Qikun, the study committee member of the student union of the 64th Team of the Fifth Battalion of the First Department, said: "We very much support this meeting. I want to study hard, intensify transformation, and fight against my old ideas every day and every hour, so that I can graduate from school as soon as possible and work hard in various construction jobs in New Democratic China."

The students of Peking University, who were in the midst of major exams, were cheered and inspired to hear about the establishment of the Preparatory Committee of the New CPPCC. Student Xu Shihua said: The establishment of the Preparatory Committee of the New CPPCC makes our students feel extremely excited. What we Peking University students have been striving for since the May Fourth Movement is democracy and science. We have suffered countless persecutions by the reactionaries, but we have not been disappointed. Today, the birth of New China has brought infinitely broad prospects for the development of Chinese youth. We are all determined to intensify our studies, prepare to serve the working people, and strive for the construction of New China. The students of the Fourth Middle School were happy to hear the news that the New CPPCC meeting was about to be held, and said: "We have been looking forward to it for a long time, and now it is finally about to be realized." Some students said: "This CPPCC includes all democratic parties and people's organizations, and there are also our student representatives. If it were not for the great victory of the People's Liberation Army and the Chinese Communist Party truly thinking of the people everywhere and doing whatever the people need, how could the convening of the New CPPCC be realized!" The students of the Girls' Affiliated Middle School saw the list of 134 true people's representatives from 23 units, and everyone said indescribably happily that the success of the New CPPCC accelerated the demise of the reactionaries, and the remnant forces of the Kuomintang would be immediately eliminated under the unprecedented unity of the Chinese people. They also said: Students under the rule of the Kuomintang never participated in the government, but today students also participated in the New CPPCC, which can only be done under the leadership of the Communist Party. We must intensify our study of revolutionary theory, master scientific skills, and participate in construction work and revolutionary cause under the leadership of the democratic coalition government.

This is a great unity of all democratic classes, all nationalities, and all professions in the country

The reporter visited Mr. Liu Yifeng, the person in charge of the National Pharmaceutical Industry Association of the Beiping Chamber of Commerce. Mr. Liu is one of the representatives of the Beiping National Pharmaceutical Industry. He pointed to a copy of the People's Daily spread out on his desk and said excitedly: "The Preparatory Committee of the New CPPCC shows the unprecedented unity of all democratic classes, all nationalities, and all different professions in the country. As far as Beiping is concerned, this kind of unity and mutual assistance, with the strong help of the government, will definitely develop production well." Finally, he put forward a hope, please strengthen the government's leadership over various industries, and strengthen the education of the capital in various industries.

Only the Chinese Communist Party truly respects ethnic minorities

Huang Jingtao (Dingzhen Zhamusu), the principal of the Mongolian and Tibetan School, said: "I was really particularly happy to see Chairman Mao's speech published in the newspaper, which mentioned ethnic minorities several times. The Chinese Communist Party already has a correct policy towards ethnic minorities, and today's situation in Inner Mongolia is a demonstration. Under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and the joint efforts of the people of all ethnic groups in China, the overall victory of the people of all ethnic groups in China is certain. The New CPPCC will definitely seek happiness for the people of all ethnic groups along the correct path, and ethnic minorities will unite with the people of all ethnic groups under the leadership of the coalition government and strive to build a new democratic New China. "Ma Jian, a professor in the Department of Oriental Languages ​​at Peking University and a Hui Muslim, said: "The Preparatory Committee of the New CPPCC has representatives of ethnic minorities participating. From the perspective of ethnic minorities, this alone is different from the past. This is what we feel most happy about." After Mr. Ma recounted to reporters the historical facts of the Hui people being discriminated against, he said: Especially during the Kuomintang rule, they did not recognize the Hui nationality at all. Even the "Hui people" were not allowed to be mentioned, but they said that the Huihui were Han people who believed in Islam. There is only a religious problem, not a national problem. Mr. Ma said very happily: "Only the Chinese Communist Party respects ethnic minorities. Under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, all ethnic groups respect and help each other, which can increase the unity between each other. Imperialism cannot provoke hatred between our ethnic groups."

Engineers no longer have to worry about not being able to use what they have learned

Li Liang, a senior engineer at the Engineering Bureau of the Ministry of Railways, said: The establishment of the Preparatory Committee of the New CPPCC has made the people of China feel excited and comforted. Everyone recognizes that an independent, free, peaceful, democratic, prosperous, and strong New China has laid the foundation today. This is entirely the result of the Communist Party's wise leadership, the People's Liberation Army's heroic and skillful combat, and the concerted efforts of democratic forces across the country. Engineers have also suffered many hardships in the past thirty years: they received colonial education in schools, learned a little technology, and did not know how many twists and turns they had taken. In terms of political understanding, they were deceived by the reactionaries, emphasizing pure technology and ignoring the issue of who they served. In life, they were tempted by the ruling class and became agents of the exploiters, creating contradictions between employees and workers without realizing it. The most painful thing is that heroes have no place to use their talents: recently, an engineer from Sichuan talked about his twelve years of work on the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway, but he has never taken the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway train once; and there are many engineers who studied mining and have now transferred to become railway engineers. There are many such examples. From now on, I believe that the suffering of engineers will not come again, especially new engineering personnel can save a lot of time wasted in learning technology. In the future, they will only worry about not knowing enough, rather than having no place to use their talents. A responsible member of the Preparatory Committee for the First National Science Conference of the All-China Federation said: We scientific workers feel very excited about the convening of this Preparatory Committee of the New CPPCC. This meeting not only includes representatives of various democratic parties, but also representatives of people's organizations. We scientific workers also have representatives participating. From here, we see the truly democratic style of a new democratic country. We scientific workers unanimously believe that we must unite in the future, under the leadership of the new government, and strive to cooperate with the government's work around the development of New China's production and construction and serve the people.

    新政协筹备会成立
    各界人民一片欢声
    【本报专访】新政协筹备会成立的消息公布了，每个人都在期待与关心着这个消息，都在想着或说出了自己的意见，拥护已经成立的新政协筹备会，拥护即将成立的联合政府。本报记者昨（二十）日曾与各界人士广泛接触，现在分别报导其中一部分意见如下。
  “青年界有代表参加政协这还是头一次”
    中国新民主主义青年团中央委员会负责同志说：新政治协商会议筹备会的召开，是中国历史上的一件大事。全国青年多少年来英勇奋斗，正是要推翻腐旧的反动统治，建立一个独立、民主的新中国。中国青年的远大发展前途，从此有了更可靠的保障。此次新政协筹备会成立，青年界也有自己的代表出席参加，这也是历史上的第一次，这说明了在新民主主义社会中，青年享有了过去旧社会所没有的政治权利，我们的地位是空前提高了。新民主主义青年团中央，将号召全体青年团员及全国爱国青年，热烈拥护这一具有伟大历史意义的新政治协商会议。
  “这个会象征着全国妇女的解放”
    中华全国民主妇女联合会认为：即将召开的新政治协商会议，在政治意义上是历史上的创举。它包括了各党派，各人民团体，人民解放军，代表着广大的群众基础。参加会的中华全国民主妇女联合会的六位代表，代表着二千二百六十多万有组织的妇女群众。会上一切事情都已经过民主协商，顺利通过了。这个会象征着全国妇女的解放。但我们的责任也更加重了：要动员全国妇女群众，为消灭国民党反动残余力量及建设新中国而奋斗。
    “我们是新政协和民主联合政府的忠实支持者”
    北平纠察总队某部于昨（二十）日下午三时分组讨论新政协筹备会成立的伟大历史意义。徐长礼等说：“新政协筹备会的召开是不容易的：三年来，前方战士流了多少血，后方人民出了多少汗，新政协是从血汗里长出来的。我们希望召开新政协迅速成立联合政府，领导中国人民努力生产，把中国变为工业国，充实国防，把中国成为钢铁一样的坚强，使帝国主义不敢来侵害我们。我们中国人民解放军一定要永远成为坚强无敌的中国人民的武装力量。我们是新政协会议和民主联合政府的忠实支持者”。
    “过去工人受压迫就因为政权在少数官僚资本家手里”
    参加“二七”大罢工的老英雄路懋，听到新政协筹备会成立的消息，脸上充满红光。他现在是七十兵工厂六所的锻工，解放后四月间该厂成立工会时，他被选为副主任兼六所工会办事处主任。他说：“过去工人受压迫，就是因为政权在少数官僚资本家手里”。他用手一个一个指点着参加筹备会和常委会的名单说：“你看，这次新政协没有反动分子参加，是咱共产党毛主席号召发起召集的。总工会有不少代表参加，这就保证了无产阶级的领导作用。”他并立时向该厂工会建议，要把今天报上新政协筹备会的消息写在黑板报、大字报上，还要召开工人座谈会。他说：“这是件大事情，要让每个工友知道。”
    北平被服二厂缝纫女工金西珍竭诚拥护新政协筹备会，提出了几点希望。她说：将来新政协会议召开之后，成立了联合政府，希望帮助女工做好保育工作，对于家庭妇女和年老的女工，适当解决她们的工作和生活问题。其他如工人子弟入学、工人医药等问题，相信政府都会很好的解决。
    “过去反动派迫害我们  今天学生也有代表参加”
    北京大学教授袁翰青说反动政权的被摧毁和人民政权的建立是历史的必然。新政协筹备会的召开，为建立全国人民政权的一个准备工作。在教授方面，大家都感到新的政协会议必然会成立全国的民主联合政府，那时高等教育的发展一定是可以更顺利的进行的，教授方面都感到非常的兴奋，大家都表示愿意全心拥护这个划时代的历史事件。
    华北大学第一部五六区队有两千同学，听到新政协筹备会成立都很高兴。第一部第五区队六十四队学生会学委陈启昆说：“我们非常拥护这个会议。我要努力学习，加紧改造，每日每时和自己的旧思想作斗争，以便早日学成出校，到新民主主义中国的各种建设工作岗位上去努力。”
    正在大考期间的北京大学的学生，听到新政协筹备会成立，一致欢欣鼓舞。许世华同学说：新政协筹备会的成立，我们学生感到无比的兴奋。我们北大学生自五四以来所努力追求的，正是民主和科学。我们遭受过反动派无数次的迫害，但我们没有失望。今天，新中国的诞生给我们中国青年的发展带来了无比广阔的前途，我们都决心加紧学习，准备为劳动人民服务，为新中国的建设而奋斗。四中同学听到新政协会议即将召开的消息，都高兴地说：“我们老早盼望着，现在终于就要实现了。”有的同学说：“这次的政协，包括着各民主政党，各人民团体，其中还有我们学生代表，要不是人民解放军的伟大胜利和中国共产党真正处处为人民着想，人民需要什么就做什么的话，新政协的召开怎能实现呢！”女附中同学看到二十三个单位一百三十四位真正人民代表的名单，大家说不出的痛快，都说：新政协的成功，加速了反动派的灭亡，国民党的残余势力，在中国人民空前的大团结下，一定会马上消灭。他们又说：在国民党统治下的学生，从没有参加政权，而今天学生也参加了新政协，这只有在共产党领导下才能如此。我们一定要在民主联合政府领导下加紧学习革命理论，掌握科学技能，参加建设工作和革命事业。
    这是全国各民主阶层各民族各种职业者的大团结
    记者于北平市商会访问国药业同业公会负责人刘一峰先生。刘先生为北平国药业资方代表之一。他指着办公桌上铺开的一张人民日报兴奋地说：“新政协筹备会表现了全国各民主阶层，各民族，各种不同职业的人的空前团结。就北平来说，这种团结互助，又有政府的大力帮助，一定会把生产发展好。最后他提出一点希望，请政府加强对各行业的领导，加强对各行业资方的教育。
    只有中国共产党真尊重少数民族
    蒙藏学校的校长黄静涛（丁贞扎木素）说：“看到了报纸上登载的毛主席的讲话，几次提到少数民族，真是特别的高兴。中国共产党对于少数民族已有了正确的政策，今日内蒙情况是一个示范。在中国共产党的领导和中国各民族人民的共同努力下，中国各族人民的全面胜利是肯定的了。新政协一定能循着正确的途径为各族人民谋幸福，少数民族将在联合政府的领导下，与各族人民团结，努力建设新民主主义新中国。北京大学东方语文系教授、回民马坚先生说：“新政协筹委会里有少数民族代表参加，从少数民族的立场来说，仅这一点就和已往不同了。这是我们感到最愉快的。”马先生对记者追述回民在历史上被歧视的史实后说：特别在国民党统治时代，根本不承认有回族。甚至连“回民”都不许提。而说回回是回教信仰的汉人。只有宗教问题，没有民族问题。马先生十分愉快地说：“只有中国共产党才尊重少数民族。在中国共产党的领导下，各民族互相尊重，互相帮助，才能增加彼此间的团结。帝国主义就不能从中挑拨我们民族间的仇恨了。”
    工程师们也不用再愁学无所用了
    铁道部工务局长老工程师黎亮说：新政协筹备会的成立，使得全中国人民感到兴奋和安慰，大家公认独立、自由、和平、民主、富强的新中国，在今天已奠定了基础。这完全是共产党的英明领导、解放军的英勇善战及全国民主力量协同努力的结果。工程师在这三十多年以来，也是苦难重重：在学校里所受的是殖民地化的教育，学会一点技术，不知道走了多少曲折迂回的道路。在政治认识上，受到反动派的蒙蔽，强调单纯的技术，忽略了为谁服务的问题。在生活上受了统治阶级的诱惑，做了剥削者的代管人，造成职员工人间的矛盾而不自知。还有最感痛苦的一点，是英雄无用武之地：最近由四川来的一位工程师谈，他在成渝路工作十二年，迄今没有坐过一次成渝路的火车；还有许多学采矿的工程师，现在已转业成为铁路上的工程师，象这样的例子很多。从今以后，我认为工程师的苦难已不会再来，尤其是新工程人员可以把学习技术所浪费的时日节省不少，今后只怕自己所知的不够，而不是无用武之地了。中华全国第一次科学会议筹备会负责筹委谈：我们科学工作者对这次新政协筹备会的召开感到很大的兴奋。在这次的会议里不仅包括了各个民主党派的代表，而且还有人民团体的代表。我们科学工作者也有代表参加了。从这里我们看到了新民主主义国家的真正民主的作风，我们科学工作者大家一致认为今后一定要团结起来，在新政府的领导下，围绕着发展新中国的生产建设，努力配合政府工作，为人民服务。
