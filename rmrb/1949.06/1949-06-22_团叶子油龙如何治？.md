To the Editor:

In recent years, the cotton leaves here have been easily damaged, such as "Tuan Yezi" (Cotton Leaf Curl) and "Oil Dragon" insect infestations. I would like to request answers to the above problems and would also like to have introduced preventative and treatment methods, preferably cost-effective and labor-saving local remedies.

	Xu Buzheng, Teacher, Fifth District, Lingshou

Comrade Buzheng:

Aphids and mites (literally, "fire dragons") can both cause cotton leaves to curl, but generally speaking, "Tuan Yezi" refers to mite infestations. For prevention and treatment, applying rice water or thin flour paste to the tops of the plants is convenient. There are many ways to treat aphids. Last year, we and the masses tried several methods that were effective. They are introduced as follows:

	① Tobacco stem lime water: Three ounces of tobacco stems and half a pound of lime added to twenty pounds of water. ② Asphalt Emulsion: (A) One ounce of asphalt, four ounces of soda, added to forty pounds of water; (B) One ounce of asphalt, four ounces of soap, added to sixty pounds of water; (C) One ounce of asphalt, two ounces of soda, two ounces of soap, added to sixty pounds of water. ③ Tobacco extract water: One pound of tobacco extract, added to ten bowls of water. ④ Cottonseed oil emulsion: One and a half ounces each of cottonseed oil and soda, two ounces of soap, added to thirty pounds of water. ⑤ Sophora flavescens water: Half an ounce of Sophora flavescens, added to one pound of water. ⑥ Wheat bran water. ⑦ Grass ash water. ⑧ Coal smoke water. In the trial, wheat bran water and grass ash water were not as effective as asphalt emulsion and tobacco lime water, etc., but most of the masses used wheat bran water and grass ash water because these methods are convenient, save money, and are readily available.

    团叶子油龙如何治？编者同志：
    近年来这里的棉花叶很容易坏，例如“团叶子”生“油龙虫子”等，以上问题请答，并希介绍预防法和医治法，最好是省钱省力的土偏方。
    灵寿五区教员  徐步峥步峥同志：
    蚜虫和火蜘蛛（火龙）都能使棉叶发团，但一般所谓“团叶子”是指火蜘蛛而言。防治的方法，用米汤或稀面糊沾顶方便，治蚜虫的方法很多，去年我们和群众一块试用了几种办法，还有效，兹介绍如次：
    ①烟筋石灰水：烟筋三两石灰半斤加水二十斤。②柏油乳剂：（甲）柏油一两石碱四两加水四十斤，（乙）柏油一两，肥皂四两，加水六十斤。（丙）柏油一两，碱二两，肥皂二两，加水六十斤。③烟精水：烟精一斤，加水十碗。④棉油乳剂：棉油石碱各一两半，肥皂二两，加水三十斤。⑤苦参水：苦参半两，加水一斤。⑥麦糠水。⑦草灰水。⑧煤烟水。在试用当中，麦糠水和草灰水不如柏油乳剂和烟草石灰水等效力大，但大部群众用的是麦糠水和草灰水，因此水省事省钱又现成。
