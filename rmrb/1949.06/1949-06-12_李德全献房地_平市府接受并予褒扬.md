　　Li Dequan Donates Land and Property
  　The Ping Municipality Accepts and Commends Her
    [Ping City News] Madam Li Dequan, the wife of Feng Yuxiang, wrote to Mayor Ye Jianying at the end of March this year, expressing her willingness to donate 151 mu and 3 li of land in the suburbs of Ping and Tong County, which was left to her by Mr. Feng, to the Beijing Municipal People's Government for free disposal. She also offered to donate all the real estate and foundations of the former Qiushi Middle School in Jing'er Hutong, Xicheng, which belongs to Ms. Li herself. At that time, because Ms. Li attended the World Peace Congress, the government did not handle it immediately. Now that Ms. Li has returned to China, the Municipal Government has also submitted it to the North China People's Government for approval, accepting Ms. Li's kindness to the people and the People's Government, and replied with commendation.

　　李德全献房地
  　平市府接受并予褒扬
    【平市讯】冯玉祥夫人李德全先生曾在本年三月底致函叶剑英市长，表示愿将冯先生所遗留给她的平郊及通县的土地一五一亩三分三厘，献给北平市人民政府自由处理，并且把李先生自己所有的西城井儿胡同旧求知中学全部房产、地基一并献出。当时因李先生出席世界和平代表大会，政府没有马上处理。现在李先生已经回国，市府也已呈奉华北人民政府批准，接受了李先生对于人民和人民政府的这种好意，并复函予以褒扬。
