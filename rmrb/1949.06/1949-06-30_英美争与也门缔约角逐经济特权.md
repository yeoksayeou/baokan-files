Xinhua News Agency, Cairo dispatch: News from Yemen confirms that the rivalry between Britain and the United States in this Arab country is intensifying. Britain had prepared to conclude a treaty with Yemen. The visit of the British Governor-General of Aden to Yemen facilitated the progress of this plan. However, to this day, the Yemeni King Imam has not signed a treaty granting Britain economic privileges in Yemen, due to strong opposition from his brothers, especially Islam. Abdullah. Islam Abdullah is considered to be influenced by the United States and is trying to conclude such an agreement with the United States. British figures appear uneasy about this issue. This unease increased when it was learned that Saudi Arabian King Ibn Saud had established contact with Imam regarding the planned agreement. Although Britain and Yemen's Imam had agreed to keep the contents of the agreement secret before signing, Ibn Saud had already learned about it. According to news from Yemen, Islam Abdullah is plotting against the current Yemeni government, and this conspiracy is not without the help of the United States.

　　英美争与也门缔约
  　角逐经济特权
    【新华社北平二十九日电】塔斯社开罗讯：从也门来的消息证实：英美在阿拉伯东方的这个国家的角逐，正在日益加剧。英国曾准备与也门缔结协定。英国驻亚丁总督的访问也门，便利了这一计划的进行。然而，直到现在，也门国王伊曼姆尚未签订一个给予英国在也门享有经济特权的条约，这是由于他的弟兄们，特别是伊斯兰。阿布杜拉的强烈反对。伊斯兰·阿布杜拉被认为受美国的影响，并力图与美国缔结这种协定。英国方面人士在这一问题上显得不安。当获悉沙特阿拉伯国王伊本沙德与伊曼姆就筹划中的协定一事建立联系时，这种不安就更增加了。虽然英国与也门的伊曼姆都曾同意在协定签字之前保守秘密，但是，关于这一协定的内容，伊本沙德业已得知。据也门来的消息称，伊斯兰·阿布杜拉正在阴谋反对现任的也门政府，而且，这种阴谋不是没有美国的帮助的。
