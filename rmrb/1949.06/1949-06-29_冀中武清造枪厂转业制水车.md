　　[Jizhong Dispatch] To meet the needs of production and construction, the former enemy armory in Wuqing, received at the time of Wuqing's liberation, has now, with the help of the government, converted to manufacturing waterwheels. The Wuqing County government also lent 4 million yuan as capital, and 2,000 jin of sorghum to subsidize the workers' families' living expenses. It also sold the existing thirty waterwheel rims to the factory at market price, to be repaid after the waterwheels are manufactured. The factory workers are highly motivated, and under the leadership of Director Yu Yushan, they are actively reforming old tools and adding new ones. On June 1st, they officially began manufacturing waterwheel buckets and wooden frames. They have now made 350 large and small waterwheel buckets, and will be able to manufacture five waterwheels by the 15th of this month. The County Production Promotion Agency paid 2 million yuan in advance before the start of work, as a deposit for ordering waterwheels.
