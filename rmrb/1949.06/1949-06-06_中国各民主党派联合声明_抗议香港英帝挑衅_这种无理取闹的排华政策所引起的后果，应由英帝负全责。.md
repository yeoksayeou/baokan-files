Xinhua News Agency, Peiping, 5th: Li Jishen, Chairman of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang, Shen Junru and Zhang Bojun, Responsible Standing Committee Members of the China Democratic League, Huang Yanpei, Standing Director of the China National Democratic Construction Association, Ma Xulun, Standing Director of the China Association for Promoting Democracy, Tan Pingshan, Standing Committee Member of the Three People's Principles Comrades Association of the Chinese Kuomintang, Peng Zemin, Chairman of the Central Supervisory Committee of the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party, Li Zhangda, Central Executive Committee Member of the China National Salvation Association, Cai Tingkai, Chairman of the Chinese Kuomintang Democratic Promotion Association, and Chen Qiyou, Chairman of the China Zhi Gong Party, issued a joint statement regarding the Hong Kong government's deprivation of the rights of Chinese political parties and people's organizations to operate in Hong Kong and the democratic rights of every Chinese person in Hong Kong, as follows:

According to recent Hong Kong news reports, on May 25 of this year, the Hong Kong government's Legislative Council, following the Singapore government, passed the reactionary "Societies Ordinance," which stipulates that even individual members of groups outside Hong Kong will be regarded as groups, and the police can arbitrarily enter houses deemed to belong to groups or group members for searches and arrests. This will not only prevent all patriotic activities of Chinese political parties and people's organizations in Hong Kong, but will even deprive every Chinese person in Hong Kong of their democratic rights. Such reactionary measures are intolerable to the Chinese people.

Of Hong Kong's two million people, more than 99 percent are Chinese. Chinese people in Hong Kong, whether organized or as individuals, cannot avoid contact with their motherland. Prohibiting them from contacting their motherland is to deprive them of all freedom of association, assembly, and residence. Moreover, under this reactionary bill, Hong Kong will become a "police state." Hong Kong residents will constantly face the threat of being searched and arrested by the police. Such high-handed actions by the Hong Kong authorities are the deeds of the British government, which boasts of "maintaining democratic and free traditions"!

Currently, the Chinese People's Liberation Army is victoriously advancing into the southern provinces of China. Wherever the People's Liberation Army arrives, whether in Peiping, Tianjin, Yantai, Nanjing, Hankou, Shanghai, or other cities and trading ports, it strictly implements the Eight-Point Agreement, fully protecting the lives and property of foreigners (including British nationals) and never infringing upon them. However, just as the Chinese people's struggle for peace and democracy is about to achieve national victory, British imperialism, disregarding the situation, has suddenly intensified its oppression of the Chinese people and is adopting increasingly reactionary anti-China policies everywhere. To cite only the most serious examples, the illegal entry of British warships into the Yangtze River, helping the Kuomintang reactionaries and shelling the Chinese People's Army on the battlefront, is one example. In Malaya, the continuous arrest, deportation, and massacre of overseas Chinese, and the prohibition of the legal activities of overseas Chinese democratic political groups, is another example. Now, the Hong Kong government's Legislative Council has passed the anti-people and anti-democratic "Societies Ordinance," which is another equally reactionary example.

Standing on the side of the Chinese people, we solemnly declare that this series of anti-people and anti-democratic anti-China policies by British imperialism is a provocative act against the Chinese people, who are advancing towards victory. This provocation is extremely reckless and will inevitably lead to various serious consequences. It must be understood that this series of anti-people and anti-democratic anti-China policies by British imperialism will inevitably arouse the anger of the Chinese people in Hong Kong, will inevitably arouse the anger of the Chinese people at home and abroad, will inevitably damage the friendship between the Chinese and British peoples, and will inevitably hinder the establishment of normal relations between Britain and the new China. All these consequences are caused by British imperialism's adventurous provocative actions against the Chinese people and can only be borne entirely by British imperialism. Standing on the side of the Chinese people, we express our strong protest against this unreasonable anti-China policy of British imperialism. We urge all peace-loving and democratic people at home and abroad to pay close attention and take action to correct these reactionary measures by the Hong Kong authorities.

June 3, 1949, in Peiping

　　中国各民主党派联合声明
    抗议香港英帝挑衅
    这种无理取闹的排华政策所引起的后果，应由英帝负全责。
    【新华社北平五日电】中国国民党革命委员会主席李济深，中国民主同盟负责常务委员沈钧儒、章伯钧，民主建国会常务理事黄炎培，中国民主促进会常务理事马叙伦，中国国民党三民主义同志联合会常务委员谭平山，中国农工民主党中央监察委员会主席彭泽民，中国人民救国会中央执行委员李章达，中国国民党民主促进会主席蔡廷锴，中国致公党主席陈其尤为香港政府剥夺中国政治党派、人民团体在香港活动权利及在港的每一个中国人的民主权利事，发表联合声明如下：
    据最近香港电讯，本年五月二十五日，香港政府立法局继新加坡政府之后，通过了反动的“取缔社团活动条例”，该条例规定虽香港以外的社团在港的个别成员亦当作社团看待，警察可以任意进入所认为社团或社团成员的房屋内进行搜查及逮捕。似此则不但一切中国政治党派和中国人民团体在港的爱国活动皆被制止，甚至在港的每一个中国人的民主权利亦被剥夺尽净。这种反动措施是中国人民所不能容忍的。
    在香港二百万人口中，百分之九十九以上是中国人。中国人民在香港无论组织或个人，不可能不和祖国发生联系。禁止他们和祖国的联系，就是剥夺他们一切结社集会与居住的自由权。而且根据这一反动法案，香港就要变成为“警察国家”。香港居民将时时刻刻遭受被警察搜查逮捕的威胁。香港当局这种强权夺理的举动，是自夸为“保持民主自由传统”的英国政府所干的勾当！
    目前中国人民解放军正向华南各省胜利进军，人民解放军到达的地方不论是在北平、在天津、在烟台、在南京、在汉口、在上海、在其他城市和通商口岸，严格执行约法八章，充分保护外侨（英侨在内）生命财产，从未加以侵犯。但正当中国人民和平民主的斗争就要得到全国胜利的时候，英帝国主义竟不问情由，突然加紧对中国人民的压迫，到处采取越来越反动的排华政策。单就最严重的几件事来说，英国军舰非法驶入长江，在两军作战的江面，帮助国民党反动派，炮轰中国人民军队是一个例子。在马来亚，连续不断地逮捕、驱逐、屠杀华侨，并禁止华侨民主政团的合法活动，是另一个例子。现在香港政府立法局通过反人民反民主的“取缔社团活动条例”，又是一个同样反动的例子。
    我们站在中国人民立场，郑重声明：英帝国主义这一连串反人民反民主的排华政策，是对于正在走向胜利道路的中国人民的一种挑衅行动。这种挑衅是万分冒险的，必然会引起各种严重的后果。必须明白：英帝国主义这一连串反人民反民主的排华政策，将无可避免地引起香港中国人民的忿怒，将无可避免地引起中国国内外人民的忿怒，将无可避免地损害中英两国人民间的友谊，将无可避免地妨碍英国与新中国建立正常关系，这一切后果是由于英帝国主义对中国人民的冒险的挑衅行动所引起的，自然只能由英帝国主义负起全部责任。我们站在中国人民立场，对于英帝国主义这种无理取闹的排华政策，表示强硬的抗议。并请国内外一切爱好和平民主的人士，加以密切的注意，起来纠正香港当局这种反动措施。
