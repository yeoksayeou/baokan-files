Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 8th—The Peaceful Resolution of the Yulin Issue: The Nationalist army’s 22nd Corps, which held the isolated city of Yulin in northern Shaanxi, has accepted the eight peace terms announced by Chairman Mao of the Chinese Communist Party on January 14th. The Northwest Military Region of the Chinese People's Liberation Army is beginning to reorganize the unit into the People's Liberation Army in accordance with democratic principles. This is another example of resolving issues through peaceful means, and it is also the result of the overwhelming victory of the People's Liberation Army, the gradual awakening of the broad masses of officers and soldiers in the Nationalist reactionary army, and the firm support of the people of Yulin for genuine peace and democracy. At the beginning of last month, shortly after the Chinese People's Liberation Army crossed the Yangtze River with overwhelming force, liberating Nanjing and eliminating the last stronghold of the Nationalists in North China, Taiyuan, the 22nd Corps sent Chief of Staff Zhang Zhiyin and three others as representatives to Yan'an to express to the Northwest Military Region of the Chinese People's Liberation Army their willingness to accept the eight peace terms announced by Chairman Mao of the Chinese Communist Party, to peacefully resolve the Yulin issue, and to reorganize into the People's Liberation Army according to the orders of the Northwest Military Region of the People's Liberation Army. In accordance with the order of Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu on April 21st, the Northwest Military Region of the People's Liberation Army expressed its agreement with the intention of the 22nd Corps and accepted the request of the 22nd Corps' representatives to conduct specific consultations based on Articles 8 and 24 of the Domestic Peace Agreement. The representatives of both sides then began negotiations in Yan'an. During the negotiation process, the Nationalist reactionaries attempted to obstruct it, and a few people within the 22nd Corps also hesitated. However, the Northwest Military Region of the People's Liberation Army consistently adhered to the correct policy of the Chinese Communist Party. In late May, Xi'an and Shanghai were successively and rapidly liberated. The broad masses of the people in Yulin and the broad masses of officers and soldiers of the 22nd Corps longed for an early peaceful resolution. Furthermore, the continuous efforts of enlightened elements within the unit prompted Corps Commander Zuo Xiezhong and others to make a firm decision, and finally, a final agreement was reached on May 29th. At 10:00 AM that day, Cao Liru, the representative of the Northwest Military Region of the People's Liberation Army, and the representative of the 22nd Corps Commander Zuo Xiezhong, officially signed the agreement. According to the agreement, the 22nd Corps' direct units and the three regiments of the 86th Division, totaling more than 4,000 people, will begin to be reorganized into the People's Liberation Army on the spot in accordance with democratic principles. The Northwest Military Region of the People's Liberation Army will send three committee members, and the 22nd Corps will send two committee members to form a reorganization committee, with Zhang Dazhi as the director and Gao Lingyun as the deputy director, to carry out the reorganization work under the leadership of the Northwest Military Region. All levels of administrative organs under the former Nationalist reactionary government's Second Administrative Inspectorate District Office of Shaanxi Province, as well as all organs, enterprises, warehouses, banks, postal and telecommunications offices, newspapers, schools, and cultural institutions within and outside Yulin City that originally belonged to the central and provincial systems of the Nationalist reactionary government, will be taken over by the Yulin Military Control Commission appointed by the Northwest Military Region of the People's Liberation Army. The local militias organized by the former Nationalist reactionary government will also be reorganized and dealt with by the Yulin Military Sub-district of the People's Liberation Army. The reorganization and takeover work is now underway.
