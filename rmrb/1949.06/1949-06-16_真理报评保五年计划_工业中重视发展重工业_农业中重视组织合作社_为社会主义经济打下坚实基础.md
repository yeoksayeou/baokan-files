　　Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 12th: According to TASS, "The main purpose of the Bulgarian Five-Year Plan for the Development of the National Economy is to realize the industrialization, electrification, mechanization of agriculture, and organization of agricultural cooperatives of the country, in order to build the foundation of a socialist economy." This was pointed out by Bello康 in a special article published in *Pravda* on February 10th. Bello氏 pointed out the main points of Bulgaria's Five-Year Plan, saying: In terms of industry, Bulgaria's industrial production in 1953 will increase by 119% compared to 1948. The Five-Year Plan attaches special importance to the development of heavy industry, with 38% of the total capital investment allocated to heavy industry. The output of machines, equipment and other means of production will more than double. In agriculture: The Five-Year Plan attaches special importance to organizing agricultural cooperatives, and relying on agricultural mechanization and modern agricultural technology to transform the scattered and backward individual farmers. The plan also pays attention to the issue of restricting and eliminating capitalist factors in rural areas. By 1953, the number of tractors used in Bulgarian rural areas will increase to 10,000, and the number of machine and tractor stations will increase to 150. Agricultural production will increase by 59% compared to 1939, and agricultural cooperatives will produce 72% of all agricultural products sold.

　　贝氏 also pointed out the achievements and roles of Bulgarian agricultural cooperatives at the end of last year and the beginning of this year. On the basis of the expansion of machine and tractor stations, agricultural cooperatives have greatly developed. The average grain harvest of most agricultural cooperatives last year exceeded that of individual farms by 25% to 30%. Most of the first batch of participants in agricultural cooperatives were poor peasants. Now, seeing the benefits of agricultural cooperatives, middle peasants have also begun to voluntarily follow the poor peasants to participate in agricultural cooperatives. 贝氏 also pointed out that the influence of the Bulgarian Communist Party in rural areas is increasing day by day. The Communist Party has 5,138 Party organizations in rural areas, and the number of rural Party members has grown to 200,700 (Note: The Bulgarian Communist Party had 496,000 members at the end of last year).

　　真理报评保五年计划
  　工业中重视发展重工业
    农业中重视组织合作社
    为社会主义经济打下坚实基础
    【新华社北平十二日电】据塔斯社讯：“保加利亚发展国民经济五年计划的主要目的，是要实现国家的工业化、电气化、农业机械化及组织农业合作社，以建设社会主义经济的基础。”这是贝洛康二月十日在真理报上所发表的专文里指出的。贝氏指出保加利亚五年计划的要点说：在工业方面，保国的工业生产量到一九五三年将比一九四八年增加百分之一百一十九。五年计划特别重视发展重工业，资产投资总额中已有百分之三十八拨给重工业。机器、器械等生产工具的产量将增加两倍多。农业方面：五年计划特别重视组织农业合作社，并依靠农业机械化和近代化的农业技术来改造分散落后的个体农民。计划同时也注意限制并消灭农村中资本主义因素的问题。到一九五三年，保加利亚农村使用的拖拉机，将增加到一万部，机器与拖拉机站将增加到一百五十个。农业生产将比一九三九年增加百分之五十九，农业合作社将生产占一切出售的农产品的百分之七十二。
    贝氏并指出保加利亚农业合作社在去年年底和今年年初所得到的成就和所起的作用。在机器与拖拉机站扩大的基础上，农业合作社已大大发展。大多数农业合作社去年的谷物收获量，平均超过个体农场百分之二十五到三十。第一批参加农业合作社的大多是贫农。现在，中农们看到农业合作社有这样的好处，也开始自愿地跟着贫农参加农业合作社。贝氏并指出保加利亚共产党在农村中的影响正在一天天地增加，共产党在农村中已有了五千一百三十八个共产党组织，农村党员已发展到二十万零七千多人（按：保共会党于去年底有四十九万六千党员）。
