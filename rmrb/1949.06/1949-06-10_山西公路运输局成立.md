　　Shanxi Highway Transportation Bureau Established
    [Taiyuan Electric] The Taiyuan Military Control Commission and the North China People's Government, in order to unify transportation forces and develop public and private transportation enterprises, have approved the merger of the highway transportation agencies that had been scattered by the bandit Yan for a long time, and established the Shanxi Highway Transportation Bureau. It consists of three departments: an engineering office, a transportation company, and a repair and manufacturing department. The bureau has formulated a half-year work plan, which anticipates repairing three highways from Taiyuan to Jundu, Jincheng, and Datong. Two survey teams have been formed and will depart shortly to begin work.
