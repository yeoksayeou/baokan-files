Arousing Transportation Personnel in Northern Bureaus, Eliminating Bureaucratic Work Styles, and Reorganizing Transportation Work

　　This time, the Ministry of Railways' experiment with the locomotive traction quota and speed between Tianjin and Zhengzhou broke the highest records of the enemy, puppet, and Kuomintang periods, and achieved new results. At the same time, the responsible comrades of the Transportation Bureau also inspected the transportation work of various bureaus along the Tianjin-Zhengzhou line and found that there are currently some chaotic, disorganized, and irresponsible bureaucratic phenomena in the transportation work of various bureaus. The existence of these phenomena seriously hinders the progress of the people's railway transportation work, which should arouse high vigilance and urgently needs to be improved.

　　The Northern Bureaus were established for a relatively short time, and they have not been able to accumulate more experience in operation and management. At the same time, the lines and various equipment are also relatively poor. Under such conditions, through the active efforts of all railway workers, the successful completion of several heavy transportation tasks is a considerable achievement and should be commended. However, on the other hand, we must face up to the shortcomings of the current bureaus, especially the serious phenomena of chaos, disorganization, and irresponsibility in transportation work.

　　What are the chaotic, disorganized, and irresponsible phenomena that currently exist in the transportation work of various bureaus?

　　First, it is manifested in the inattention and irresponsibility of the heads of various stations and sections of the bureaus towards station services. The cleanliness of various stations along the Tianjin-Zhengzhou line is very poor. Many stations and tracks are full of garbage and dust, and some stations are even full of human and animal excrement, with a foul smell. At the Xuzhou station passenger entrance, livestock are allowed to enter and exit at will without being stopped. 85% to 90% of the station's switches have not been wiped. Tangguantun Station is relatively good, but only switches No. 1 and No. 3 have been wiped, and No. 5 has never been wiped and no one cares. Many stations often use car doors instead of springboards, and discard them after use, especially at stations along the Longhai Line. This attitude of irresponsibility and lack of care for the people's property deserves serious attention.

　　Many stations have not yet built wooden fences or iron railings in time. Passengers and hawkers run around and get on and off the train at will, which not only affects order but also leads to missed tickets and reduced income. Faced with this situation, stationmasters and station staff turn a blind eye and let it go, and the railway police do not perform their duties. This is especially true for stations between Jinan and Zhengzhou. The lack of objective conditions and fences certainly increases the difficulty of maintaining order, but if you really use your brains, use your hands, and take responsibility, it can be solved.

　　Some personnel still follow the old bureaucratic work style, and do not deeply understand and grasp the business and personnel they are responsible for, but instead put on the airs of old railways and old diplomas to intimidate people. For example, Ai Zuoyun, the stationmaster of Xuzhou East Station, does not understand the personnel situation of his station. Xuzhou East Station and North Station are very close, but there is no contact in work, and they do not know each other. The Xuzhou East Station plan number does not know the train's on-time or late running status. Another example is Yao Meichen, the operations section chief of the Jinan Bureau, who does not understand the situation in his jurisdiction. When he was asked to go to the site to inspect the work, he complained, saying: "The Ministry has a big mouth, and we have a small mouth. We are just being played with. They want everything from us. Measuring the effective length is the job of the engineering department, and it is not appropriate to ask the operations section to do it." "Four hundred yuan is only issued for four days of travel, and it is only enough to live on by selling my wife and children," and other strange remarks.

　　Secondly, there is also chaos on the trains. Passengers are not taken care of and no one is responsible. For example, on June 15, the No. 226 passenger train between Xuzhou and Jinan had 14 cars with a capacity of 1,066 people, but according to the report of ticket inspector Zheng Baoxi, the actual number of passengers was 1,950, almost exceeding half. There was one conductor, two ticket inspectors, one baggage clerk, one baggage worker, one liaison officer, five service personnel, and six railway police on the train, but only three cars were checked when the train arrived in Yanzhou, with a total of 257 tickets supplemented and a collection of 197,613 yuan in RMB. Because passengers can get on and off the train at will along the way without management, it greatly creates the phenomenon of passengers riding without tickets. If the minimum number of missed tickets per train is 500, and the shortest travel distance per person is 60 kilometers, the minimum loss per train is 60,000 yuan (calculated at the current ticket price of 2 yuan per person per kilometer). This is a great loss, and it also increases passengers' opinions and complaints about the people's railway. This kind of thing does not happen occasionally once or twice, but exists for a long time. According to reports, conductors and crew members have repeatedly reflected and requested an increase in the number of trains, but it has not been resolved.

　　The leaders of the transportation departments of these bureaus either do not know about these situations at all, or they know about them but do not promptly inspect and improve them. The staff of the transportation department (car department) and the transportation section (car section) mostly work at their desks every day, and do not go deep into the lower levels to understand the situation and inspect the work, still following the old bureaucratic institutions and the style of paperwork, which fully shows the current lack of attention and irresponsibility towards transportation work.

　　In terms of business operations, some individuals also have serious phenomena of corruption and embezzlement, which are currently under investigation. All railway workers should resolutely fight against all phenomena of corruption and embezzlement, and if necessary, these corrupt elements should be purged. These facts show that today, some bad work styles from the old society still exist in the Northern Bureaus, and individual backward workers have not yet properly transformed themselves to implement the spirit of serving the people into the transportation work of the people's railway.

　　In terms of dispatching work, the bureaus have not done a good job in deploying and promoting the unified dispatching method decided at the National Dispatching Conference. According to actual understanding, although most dispatchers do not fully understand the new method, they all have great interest. The Zhengzhou Bureau and the Jinan Bureau have not fully established the shift system for dispatching work, so the work of dispatchers cannot be inspected and improved. The bureaus do not have enough control over the use of vehicles, do not pay attention to stored vehicles and non-operational vehicles, and use vehicles at will. For example, the dispatching team leader of the Zhengzhou Bureau has never done dispatching work, and does not understand the business. It is very difficult and inappropriate to deploy such cadres to carry out work.

　　The transportation departments of the bureaus are relatively inadequate in arranging work in their leadership, or they only arrange work without inspection, or even do not arrange work at all, and do not understand the situation below. For example, the transportation plan decided at the dispatching conference was not arranged by the Zhengzhou Bureau, and even the leaders themselves could not deeply understand it. Although the Jinan Bureau had arrangements, it did not inspect them, so the Xuzhou Office failed to implement the decision to send coal cars. The Pingjin Bureau arbitrarily revised the plan without reporting it afterwards. This shows that the leaders of the transportation work of the bureaus do not grasp the work tightly enough and let it go, forming a serious phenomenon of irresponsibility and no one being responsible, which can also be said to be an act of disorganization and indiscipline.

　　It should be emphasized that the reason for the current shortcomings in the transportation work of the bureaus is not that we lack positive figures. Since liberation, many new figures and new things have emerged in the railway reception work and business work. For example, in the reception, many road protection heroes and the heroic figures of the May 1st Labor Day of the Fengtai Locomotive Depot, especially the lower-level workers, are constantly growing in enthusiasm. The main reason is that the bureaucratic work style left over from the old institutions and leaders has not been eliminated, especially the bureaucratic work style existing in the section and class-level cadres, the resolutions of the National Transportation Conference and Dispatching Conference have not been thoroughly implemented, a responsibility system has not been established in the transportation departments, the work has not been thoroughly understood and inspected, and the masses have not been well relied upon to hold meetings and discuss to solve problems, thus forming a state of no one being responsible, disorganized and anarchic in the entire transportation work.

　　Faced with these realistic shortcomings, the transportation departments (car departments) and all staff of the bureaus should mobilize, eliminate bureaucratic work styles, and overcome the current phenomena of chaos, disorganization, and irresponsibility. Implement the spirit and resolutions of the National Dispatching Conference and Freight Rate Conference. Unify dispatching work, establish a reporting system, implement planned transportation, and promote and implement a responsible system. At the same time, they should immediately rectify station order and cleanliness and hygiene work. Appropriately adjust personnel, and individual unqualified personnel should be transferred. Go deep into the lower levels, understand the reflections of the masses, and solve problems in a timely manner. They should also cultivate typical examples, break through one point, promote the overall situation, and closely cooperate with the machine, engineering, electrical, inspection, and public security departments. It is required that the transportation departments of the bureaus have a completely new look within one or two months, so that the transportation work and the entire business of the people's railway can be improved on the existing basis.

　　唤起北方各局运输人员，肃清官僚主义作风，整理运输工作
    这次铁道部试验天津郑州间机车牵引定数和速度，打破了敌伪及国民党时期的最高纪录，获得了崭新的成绩。与此同时，运输局负责同志并检查了天津郑州间沿线各局的运输工作，发现目前各局运输工作上存在着某些紊乱散漫和无人负责的官僚主义的现象。由于这些现象的存在，严重的妨碍了人民铁道运输工作的前进，是应该引起高度警惕和急待改进的。
    北方各局成立时期较短，在经营管理上还未能够累积更多的经验。同时，线路和各种设备也都比较差。在这样的条件下，经过全体铁路职工的积极努力，顺利的完成了几次繁重运输任务，是有相当的成绩，是应该加以表扬的。但另一方面又必须正视目前各局存在的缺点，尤其是运输工作中存在着的紊乱散漫和无人负责的官僚主义的严重现象。
    目前存在各局运输工作上有些什么紊乱散漫和无人负责的现象呢？
    首先是表现在各局的各站段负责人对车站站务工作的不注意和无人负责。天津郑州间沿线各站整洁很差。很多车站里和轨道上都是垃圾和灰尘，有些车站更满地人粪马尿，臭气冲人，徐州车站旅客出入口，任意牲口进出，不加制止，各站的道岔有百分之八十五至百分之九十就没有擦过，唐官屯站还比较好，但也只有一号及三号道岔擦了，五号根本就从未擦过也没人管，有许多车站经常用车门代替跳板，用完到处丢下不管，特别是陇海沿线各站为甚，这些对工作无人负责和不爱惜人民财产的态度，是值得严重注意的。
    许多车站周围还没有及时围筑木栅或铁栏，往来旅客和小贩跑帮随便上车下车，不但影响秩序紊乱，而且漏票，减少收入。面对此种情况，站长和车站职工都视若无睹，放任自流，而路警也不执行任务。尤以济南郑州间各站为最，客观条件不够，没有栅栏固然增加了维持秩序的困难，但如果真正动动脑筋动动手负起责任来是可以解决的。
    还有某些人员仍然因循过去官僚主义的旧作风，对本身负责的业务和人事不深入了解和掌握，反而摆着老铁路老文凭的架子来吓唬人。例如徐州东站站长艾作云对本站人事情况就不了解，徐州东站和北站近在咫尺，但在工作上从无联系，互不认识，徐州东站计划车号对列车正晚点也不知道。再如济南局运转课长姚美忱对管内情况既不了解，要他同去检查现场工作时，反发牢骚说：“部里嘴大，我们嘴小，尽耍着我们玩，什么都向我们要，测量有效长度是工务的事，叫运转课作就不合适。”“出来四天只发四百元，要卖老婆孩子才够过活”等怪话。
    其次在列车上也同样存在着紊乱的情形，旅客在列车上无人照顾，无人负责。例如六月十五日徐州济南间二二六次旅客列车挂十四辆车，定员一○六六人，但据查票员郑宝玺报告，实际乘车人数为一九五○人，旅客几乎超过一半，列车上有车长一人，查票员二人，行李员一人，行李工一人，联络员一人，服务生五人，路警六人，但列车到兖州时仅查了三个车的票，计补票二五七人，收款一九七六一三元人民币，由于沿途旅客可以随便上下，无人管理，就大大造成旅客无票坐车的现象，如果以每列车漏票最低人数五百人，每人最短乘车区间按六十公里计，每列车最低损失六万元（按现行票价每人每公里二元计）这是一笔很大损失，同时沿途旅客在列车上到处攀乘，不仅车顶上，甚至连机车煤水车以及单机上都堆满了人，尤以济南徐州郑州间为甚，这样不但铁路收入受到损失，而且增加旅客对人民铁道的意见和抱怨。这类事情的发生，并不是偶而一二次，而是长期的存在，据报车长乘务员们曾经屡次反映，请求增加车次，但始终没有解决。
    这些情况，各局运输部门的领导上，有的是根本不知道，有的是知道而不及时加以检查改善，运输处（车务处）和运输段（车务段）的工作人员，每天多是伏案工作，不去深入下层，了解情况检查工作，仍因袭旧的官僚机构及事务主义的作风，充分表现了目前对运输工作的不够重视和不负责任。
    在营业方面，个别人员还有贪污腐化的严重现象，现正在调查中，对于一切贪污腐化的现象，全体铁路职工应该坚决的进行斗争，必要时应该把这些腐化分子清洗出去。这些事实说明了今天北方各局还存在着旧社会里一些坏作风，个别落后的职工还没有好好的改造自己，把为人民服务的精神贯彻到人民铁道的运输工作上。
    在调度工作方面，各局对于全国调度会议上所决议的统一调度办法，都没有很好的布置和推动，根据实际了解，一般调度员虽然对新办法还不太完全了解，但都具有很大的兴趣，郑州局济南局对调度工作上的交班制度并没有完全建立，因而对调度员工作无法检查和提高，各局对车辆运用的掌握不够，没有注意封存车及非运用车，随便动用车辆，再如郑州局调度员领班就从未干过调度工作，对业务不了解，配备这样的干部来开展工作，是很困难很不合适的。
    各局运输部门在领导上对工作布置是比较不够周到，或者只有布置没有检查，或者甚至就没有布置，也不去了解下面情况。如调度会议上决议的运输计划，郑州局没有布置，并且连领导上自己也不能深入了解。济南局虽有布置，但没有检查，以致徐州办事处，就未能执行送煤车的决定，平津局则擅自修改计划，事后也不呈报，这表现了各局运输工作领导上对工作抓得不够紧，放任自流，形成不负责任和无人负责的严重现象，也可以说是无组织无纪律的行为。
    应当着重地指出目前各局运输工作上存在的缺点，其原因不是我们缺乏积极人物，自从解放以来铁路接收工作和业务工作上，出现很多新人物新事物。例如在接收中许多护路英雄和丰台机务段五一劳动号那些英雄人物，特别是下级职工，积极性不断在滋长，而主要是由于没有肃清旧有机构领导上遗留下来的官僚主义作风，特别是处课级干部中存在着的官僚主义作风，没有彻底执行全国运输会议调度会议决议，没有在运输部门建立负责制度，没有深入了解检查工作，没有很好的依靠群众开会讨论来解决问题，因而形成整个运输工作无人负责，无组织无政府的状态。
    面对着这些现实的缺点，各局运输部门（车务部门），全体工作人员应该动员起来，肃清官僚主义作风，克服目前存在的紊乱散漫和无人负责的现象。贯彻全国调度会议运价会议的精神和决议。统一调度工作，建立表报制度，实行计划运输，并推行贯彻负责制度。同时应该立即整理车站秩序和整洁卫生工作。适当调整人事，个别不称职者应加以调动。深入下层，了解群众反映，及时解决问题，并且应该培植典型，突破一点，推动全面，密切配合机、工、电、检、公安各部门，要求在一两个月内各局运输部门要有焕然一新的面貌，使运输工作和人民铁道整个业务能在现有基础上提高。
