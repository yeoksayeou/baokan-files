    (I) German News Agency, Hanover: The chairman of the Communist Party of Lower Saxony, Karl Müller, who was previously accused of "insulting" Herbert Kriedemann, a member of the Central Committee of the German Social Democratic Party, has now been forced to release him by the local court. Müller proved that Kriedemann, now one of the Social Democratic representatives in the Economic Council, was an agent during the Hitler regime and that he betrayed some Social Democratic Party members to the secret service. The court's judgment had to admit that the documents presented by Müller were irrefutable. Kriedemann was also forced to admit that he had been an agent.
    (II) London: Members of the National Union of Railwaymen in Britain have been engaged in a "slowdown" at the two major railway stations in the London area since May 30, demanding wage increases. Train drivers in northeastern and eastern England have also held three consecutive Sunday strikes.
    (III) Prague: The Federation of Students' Unions of various universities here strongly protested to the Hyderabad Military Court against the death sentence imposed on eight Indian youths.
