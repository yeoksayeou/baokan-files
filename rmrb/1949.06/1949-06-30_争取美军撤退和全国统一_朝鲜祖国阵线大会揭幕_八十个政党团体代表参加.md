Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, June 29th: TASS, Pyongyang dispatch: The inaugural meeting of the Korean Democratic Fatherland United Front opened on the 25th in a joyous atmosphere at the Moranbong Theater in Pyongyang. Representatives from various parties and public organizations from both North and South Korea attended the meeting. Kim Tu-bong, Chairman of the Preparatory Committee of the Democratic Fatherland United Front and Chairman of the Supreme People's Assembly of Korea, delivered the opening address to the conference. Kim Tu-bong pointed out that the purpose of establishing the Fatherland Front is to unite all parties and public organizations fighting for the withdrawal of American troops and the reunification of Korea.

Conference Vice-Chairman Heo Heon Reports on the International and Domestic Situation and Our Tasks
After the agenda was adopted, Heo Heon, Vice-Chairman of the Preparatory Committee, delivered a report on "The International and Domestic Situation and Our Tasks." Heo Heon pointed out that in the current situation, we are facing the issue of establishing a national united front that unites all Korean democratic forces. Eighty parties and public organizations from North and South Korea have endorsed the proposal to establish the Korean Democratic Fatherland United Front. The inaugural meeting of the United Front has opened with the participation of representatives from all patriotic parties and public organizations in North and South Korea. Heo Heon pointed out that only after the Soviet army liberated Korea did the path to establishing their own independent nation first open up for the Korean people. However, this path has been obstructed by the United States, which "from the very beginning harbored a plan to re-enslave Korea as a colony." Ignoring the protests of the Korean people, American imperialists are threatening them in South Korea with warships, airplanes, and artillery, and are engaging in divisive elections and establishing a puppet government of their lackeys. Heo Heon declared that our country already possesses all the necessary conditions to become an independent nation. The entire responsibility for dividing our country lies entirely with the American imperialists and their gang of traitors, the Syngman Rhee clique. The people of our country, with the same history and the same culture, cannot tolerate this division. The Korean people are heroically carrying out guerrilla warfare in South Korea. Neither cold nor hunger can destroy their will. This people's just patriotic struggle will bring them victory. Heo Heon continued, stating that we, who are fighting for the interests of the country and the people, must establish the Democratic Fatherland United Front in accordance with the principle of voluntary participation by parties and public organizations from North and South Korea. The United Front must actively support the government of the People's Democratic Republic established by the Korean people through the general election held on August 25, 1948. Heo Heon elaborated in detail on the great tasks facing the United Front, pointing out that in order to launch struggles and conduct activities, a central organization of the United Front must be established. All parties and public organizations participating in the United Front must have their organizational and propaganda work guided by a unified plan. In conclusion, Heo Heon said: No force can prevent the Korean people from uniting to jointly build an independent and democratic nation.

　　争取美军撤退和全国统一
  　朝鲜祖国阵线大会揭幕
    八十个政党团体代表参加
    【新华社北平二十九日电】塔斯社平壤讯：朝鲜民主祖国联合阵线的成立大会，已于二十五日在欢乐的气氛中于平壤马兰坡剧院开幕。出席大会的有南北朝鲜各党派和公共团体的代表。民主祖国联合阵线筹备委员会主席、朝鲜最高人民议会议长金枓奉首向大会致开幕词。金枓奉指出，建立祖国阵线的目的，就是把所有为争取美军撤退和朝鲜统一而战的各党派和公共团体团结在一起。
    大会副主席许宪报告　国际与国内形势和我们的任务
    大会通过议程后，筹备委员会副主席许宪发表了“国际与国内形势和我们的任务”的报告。许宪指出，在目前的形势下，我们正面临着建立团结所有朝鲜民主力量的民族联合阵线的问题。南北朝鲜的八十个政党与公共团体，都拥护建立朝鲜民主祖国联合阵线的建议。联合阵线的成立大会，已在南北朝鲜所有爱国党派与公共团体的代表参加之下开幕了。许宪指出，只有在苏军解放朝鲜以后，才首次为朝鲜人民打开了建立他们自己的独立国家的道路。然而，这一道路却被美国阻碍着，它“从最初起就怀着对朝鲜再实行殖民地奴役的计划”。不顾朝鲜人民的抗议，美帝国主义者正在南朝鲜用军舰、飞机及大炮威胁他们，并从事分裂的选举和建立其走狗的傀儡政府。许宪宣称，我们国家已具有成为独立国家的一切必要条件。分裂我们国家的整个责任，完全要由美帝国主义者及其走狗——李承晚卖国集团来负。有着同一历史和同一文化的我国人民，不能容忍这种分裂。朝鲜人民正在南朝鲜英勇地开展游击斗争。寒冷与饥饿都不能摧毁他们的意志。这个人民的正义的爱国斗争，将带给他们胜利。许宪继称，为国家与人民利益而战的我们，必须依照南北朝鲜各党派与公共团体自愿加入的原则建立起民主祖国联合阵线。联合阵线必须积极地拥护朝鲜人民经一九四八年八月二十五日举行的大选所建立的人民民主共和国政府。许宪详尽地阐述了联合阵线所面临的伟大任务，指出为了发动斗争与进行活动，必须设立联合阵线的中央机构。一切参加联合阵线的党派与公共团体，在其组织与宣传工作方面，必须由统一的计划来指导。许宪在结语中说：没有任何力量能够阻止朝鲜人民团结起来共同建立一个独立的民主国家。
