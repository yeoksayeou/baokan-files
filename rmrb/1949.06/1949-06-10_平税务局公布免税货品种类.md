　　Ping Tax Bureau Announces List of Tax-Exempt Goods
    [Reported by this newspaper] To strengthen the exchange of goods between urban and rural areas and avoid biased taxation, the Beiping Municipal Tax Bureau issued an instruction to its subordinate branches on the 7th, clarifying the types of goods exempt from business tax and temporary income tax. The instruction contains three articles, the original provisions of which are as follows: 1. Those who carry goods on their shoulders and hawk them along the streets; 2. Various vegetables, yellow soil, firewood, chickens, ducks, casseroles, sand pots, sand basins, green pots, bricks and tiles ash (excluding cement), rural small handicrafts (wheat straw, willow weaving products and sorghum and millet stalk woven products); 3. Self-produced and self-sold fresh and dried fruits, food, eggs, etc., with formal certification from the township government or farmers' association. (Flexibility should be used in implementation and should not be too strict.)
