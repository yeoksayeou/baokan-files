　　Shijiazhuang Suburban Agricultural Supply and Marketing Cooperative
    Cotton Loan Work Comes to an End
    [Shijiazhuang Electric] The cotton loan work of the Shijiazhuang suburban agricultural supply and marketing cooperative concluded at the end of April. A total of 742,814 jin of fertilizer (black beans and cake) and 94,386 jin of cotton seeds were loaned out. This resolved the difficulties farmers faced in obtaining fertilizer and seeds, and created favorable conditions for rural construction through this business. In addition, the method of lending in kind and repaying in kind reduced intermediate exploitation for farmers, guaranteed the specialized use of loans, and aroused farmers' interest in planting specialized crops. According to preliminary statistics, the city's cotton planting area this year is 20,373 mu, accounting for 14.48% of the total cultivated area. Although it did not reach the initial requirement of 25% due to various reasons, it has doubled compared with the period under the enemy and puppet regime. However, there were some shortcomings in the cotton loan program: for example, the cotton seeds were not tested for germination before promotion, resulting in a low germination rate and causing dissatisfaction among the masses. The work was careless, and the cotton loans were not properly distributed. Relevant departments such as the cooperative, the Construction Bureau, and the farm lacked close contact. For example, near the end of the fertilizer loan program, the farm was still promoting that there was still a lot of fertilizer available, but it could not be delivered. Also, some farmers were skeptical about using black beans as cotton fertilizer, and timely publicity and explanation were not provided.

　　石市郊农业供销社
    棉贷工作告一段落
    【石家庄电】石市郊区农业供销社的棉贷工作，四月底即已告一段落。计贷出肥料七四二、八一四斤（黑豆和饼类），棉籽九四、三八六斤。解决了农民肥料、籽种的困难，而且通过这一业务，造成了农村建设的有利条件。另外贷实还实的办法，使农民少受了中间剥削，保证了贷款的专门用途，激起了农民种植专业作物的兴趣，今年全市植棉面积，据初步统计为二零、三七三亩占总耕地面积百分之十四点四八。虽由于各种原因，未达当初百分之二十五的要求，但和敌伪时期相比较，已增加一倍。但在棉贷中有一些缺点：如对棉籽事先没有作培苗试验，就宣传如何好，结果发苗率太低，引起群众不满。工作上粗枝大叶，棉贷未能适当分配。合作社、建设局、农场等有关部门，缺乏密切联系，如贷肥快结束时，农场还在宣传肥料尚多，结果不能兑现，又如有的农民对用黑豆作棉肥怀疑，未能及时宣传解释。
