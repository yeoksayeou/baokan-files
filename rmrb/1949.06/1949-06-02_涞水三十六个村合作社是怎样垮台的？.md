　　How the Cooperative of Thirty-Six Villages in Laishui Collapsed?
　　Dong Chunguang
　　According to statistics in Laishui last autumn, there were a total of eighty-eight village cooperatives in the county. From that time until the beginning of May this year, thirty-six of them collapsed. Twenty-five collapsed from last autumn to February this year, and seven collapsed from March to the beginning of May. Seven or eight of them completely collapsed. For example, Y斗 in the first district and Sangyuan in the sixth district not only had no funds, but even sold all the furniture. Apart from this type of situation, most of the rest still had some capital, but they were no longer operating – the cadres were not responsible. Only fifty-two remain, and no new ones have been established. This is a great loss to the development of cooperative undertakings. The county leadership reviewed the reasons for their collapse, which are as follows:

　　(1) Collapse due to credit: This was more common. For example, the Pingyu Village Cooperative in the fifth district had a capital of one million yuan (border currency, same below), and within two years, it extended one million yuan in credit. It now has only sixty catties of salt and one dozen towels, which made it impossible for the funds to circulate, leading to collapse.

　　(2) Collapse due to small capital, many cadres, and large expenditures, and also due to failure to fulfill work duties: There were eight villages in this category. For example, the North Yudian Village Cooperative in the third district had 32.6 million yuan, with five cadres detached from production. From August last year to the end of March this year, a total of eight months, they should have fulfilled 530 work days. After deducting 250 days, the five people still owed 280 days. Each work day was equivalent to two sheng of corn, totaling five shi and six dou (large dou) of corn. Even if all the annual dividends were used to compensate for their owed work, it would not be enough. At the same time, the consumption of these five people was also very high. Therefore, the members withdrew all their shares, leading to collapse.

　　(3) Inability to maintain the value of goods: Due to rising prices, it seemed like profits were made in terms of money, but there were heavy losses when converted to real goods. For example, when Lower Mingyu in the second district was established in 1944, it collected thirty shi of corn. Including both the principal and interest, it cannot buy five shi of corn now. Nine cooperatives collapsed because they could not maintain the value of goods.

　　涞水三十六个村合作社是怎样垮台的？
    董春光
    涞水在去年秋天统计，全县共有村合作社八十八个，从那时到今年五月初，即垮台三十六个。去秋至今年二月垮了二十五个；三月至五月初垮了七个。全部垮了的就有七、八个，如一区玉斗，六区桑园等村，不但没有资金了，而且连家具也都卖光了，除这类情况外，其余大部是资本也有一部，但是不营业了——干部不负责任。现仅剩五十二个，没有新建的。这对发展合作事业上是一个很大的损失。该县领导上检讨其垮台的原因，共有以下几种：
    （一）赊帐赊垮：较普遍，如五区平峪村社，资金一百万元（边币，下同），二年中即赊帐一百万元，现只存六十斤盐，一打毛巾，致使资金不能周转而垮台。
    （二）资本小干部多开支大，又有负勤务而垮台的八个村，如三北峪店村社三千二百六十万元，即有脱离生产干部五人，由去年八月到今年三月底共八个月应负勤务五百三十个，除出二百五十个，五人尚欠二百八十个，每个工折玉米二升，共玉米五石六斗（大斗）将全年红利拿出来，还不够补他们的欠工，同时五的人消耗也很大，因此，社员把股金均撤出而垮了。
    （三）保不住实物：因物价上涨，按钱说是赚了，折实物则亏蚀很多。如二区下明峪四四年成立时，集玉米三十石，经营到现在本利都算上，买不了五石玉米。因保不住实物，而垮台的有九个。
