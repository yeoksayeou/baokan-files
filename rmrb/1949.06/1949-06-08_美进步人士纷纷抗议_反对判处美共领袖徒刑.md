Xinhua News Agency, Beiping, 7th: New York dispatch: The illegal sentencing of US Communist leaders Gates, Hall, and Winston by the US Federal Court has aroused strong protests from American progressives. The Civil Rights Congress, in its protest statement, declared: This action by the US government shows how eager it is to imprison communists and progressives by illegal means. The Furriers Union, in a statement to Judge Medina, denounced the verdict as "a shameless attempt to undermine the foundations of democratic justice." The president of the Chicago Electrical Workers Union branch said: Judge Medina's verdict shows that the Truman reactionary government has deprived the people of the right to criticize the government's insane policies, which are leading the United States down the road to poverty, chaos, and war. Representatives of the Chicago Consumers Association stated that Medina's actions were the most brutal violation of the people's rights in the history of American courts. The president of the Farm Equipment Workers Union, the president of the Carpenters Union branch, Professor McDougall of the University of Western America, and others, have expressed opposition to and condemnation of Medina's verdict.
    In New York, more than 500 people demonstrated in front of the federal prison, demanding the release of the three Communist leaders who had been sentenced to imprisonment. The families of the imprisoned and other US Communist leaders who are being tried are leading this demonstration. Children posted slogans saying: "Our fathers are anti-fascists, release them quickly!"

　　美进步人士纷纷抗议　反对判处美共领袖徒刑
    【新华社北平七日电】纽约讯：美联邦法庭非法判处美共领袖盖兹、霍尔及温斯顿三人徒刑一事，引起了美国进步人士的强烈抗议。人权保障大会在其抗议声明中宣称：美国政府这一行动，表明它如何急于以非法的手段来监禁共产党员和进步分子。产联毛皮工会在致法官麦迪纳的声明中，斥责判决是“破坏民主正义基础的无耻企图”。芝加哥电气工会分会主席说：麦迪纳法官的判决，说明杜鲁门反动政府剥夺了人民批评政府疯狂政策的权利，这些政策正将美国引入贫穷，纷乱和战争的道路。芝加哥消费者协会代表称：麦迪纳的行动，是美国法院有史以来对人民权利最凶残的侵害。农业机器工会主席，木匠工会分会主席，美国化西大学教授麦当盖尔和其他人士，都表示反对和谴责麦迪纳的判决。
    在纽约，五百多群众在联邦监狱门前示威，要求释放被判处监禁的三位共产党领袖。被监禁的及其他正被审讯的美共领袖的家属，领导着这个示威运动。孩子们张贴标语说：“我们的父亲反法西斯，快释放他们呀！”
