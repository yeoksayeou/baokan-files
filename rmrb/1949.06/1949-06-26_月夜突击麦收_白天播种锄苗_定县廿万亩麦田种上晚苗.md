　　[Jizhong Telegram] Ding County has victoriously completed its wheat harvest, and 200,000 mu of wheat fields have been planted with late seedlings. The spring seedlings have all been hoed for the first time, and they are now actively killing cotton aphids. During the wheat harvest, all county and district cadres, except for a small number remaining in the offices, threw themselves into the rush harvest and rush planting campaign. Many masses harvested wheat under the moonlight and sowed and weeded during the day, and put forward the slogan of "harvest one piece, plant one piece, plant one day early, harvest ten days early." The county's more than 240,000 mu of wheat land was quickly harvested, and all wheat fields, except for a very few that were too dry, were planted with late seedlings. More than 700,000 mu of spring seedlings have all been hoed for the first time.

　　月夜突击麦收　白天播种锄苗
  　定县廿万亩麦田种上晚苗
    【冀中电】定县麦收胜利完成，二十万亩麦田种上晚苗，春苗均已锄过头遍，现正积极捕杀棉花蚜虫。麦收中县区干部除少数留机关外，悉数投入抢收、抢种运动。不少群众月夜麦收，白天播种锄苗，并提出了收一块种一块，早种一日，早收十天的口号。全县二十四万余亩麦地很快收完，除极少数太干的地外，所有麦田都种上了晚苗。七十余万亩春苗，均已锄过头遍。
