Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, June 6th: TASS reports: US stock prices fell again on June 3rd, following May 31st, reaching the lowest level since 1948. According to statistics from Dow Jones, the index of 30 industrial stocks is now 168.15, compared to 193.16 in June last year, a drop of 25.01 points. The continued decline in stock prices reflects the deterioration of the US economic situation. According to estimates by the Steel Institute, steel production last week decreased by almost 2.5% compared to the previous week, and by 10% compared to mid-March. Other industrial production and trade continue to decline, and bankruptcies are also increasing. According to Dun & Bradstreet, 206 companies declared bankruptcy in the week ending May 26th, compared to 112 in the same week last year, and 102 in the same week in 1947.
　　Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, June 4th: Stock prices in the US, Britain, and Australia have been continuously falling in recent days. According to the Associated Press, stocks on the New York Stock Exchange fell by $1 to $4 per share, while various stocks worth $1,000 each fell by $1 to $8. This is the lowest record since March 1948. Among them, railway and industrial securities have created the lowest records of the year. This drop caused a loss of more than one billion US dollars. At the same time, New York cotton also fell by $1.50 to $1.65 per bale. According to the post-war decline in US stocks, it has occurred more than once. In addition to the decline that occurred simultaneously with agricultural products last spring, there have been several declines before and in the spring of this year. This shows that the US economy is always in an unstable state.
　　According to the British Information Service, the London Financial Times published an index of industrial and government stock prices, revealing that British industrial stock prices have been fluctuating since the war. By the end of May this year, its price had fallen from 140 (the post-war peak) in January 1947 to 109.6, a drop of 30.04 points. Government securities have been declining, falling from 121 (the post-war peak) in November 1946 to 113.2 in the first half of this year.
　　According to TASS, due to the sharp drop in stock and commodity prices in New York and London, Sydney stocks are becoming increasingly sluggish. Stock prices on the Sydney Stock Exchange have been falling for several weeks, reaching the lowest level since November 17, 1946. Newspapers report that stock prices are also falling on the Melbourne Stock Exchange.

　　美英股票一再跌价　工业生产继续下降
  　一周内美工业破产二百余家
    【新华社北平六日电】塔斯社报道：美国股票价格继五月三十一日之后，于六月三日再次下降，跌至一九四八年以来的最低水平。据杜琼斯统计所的统计，现在三十种工业股票的指数是一六八点一五，去年六月为一九三点一六，即跌了二十五点零一。股票价格的继续下跌，反映着美国经济情况的恶化。据钢铁研究所估计：上周钢的生产，比较再前一周几乎减少了百分之二点五，比较三月中旬减少了百分之十。其他工业生产和贸易继续下降，同时破产也在增加。据邓·布列得斯特统计所报道：在五月二十六日以前的一周内，宣告破产者二百零六家，而去年同周为一百一十二家，一九四七年同周为一百零二家。
    【新华社北平四日电】美、英、澳股票价格，近日正不断下跌。据美联社报道，纽约股票交易所的股票每股跌了一至四美元，而各种每张一千元的股票，则落了一至八元。这是一九四八年三月以来的最低纪录。其中，铁路和工业的证券则创造了本年度最低的纪录。这次跌落造成了十余亿美元的损失。同时，纽约的棉花每包也跌了一元五角至一元六角五分。按战后美国股票的跌落，已不只一次，除了去年春天与农产品同时发生的下跌以外，在以前和今年春天也先后有过好几次的降落。这说明美国经济是始终处在不稳定状态中的。
    据英国新闻处报道伦敦金融时报发表工业及政府股票价格的指数，透露英国工业股票价格在战后一直在波动中。到今年五月底，它的价格已由一九四七年一月的一百四十（战后最高峰）跌到一百零九点六，也就是跌了三十点零四。而政府证券则一直下跌，今年上半年由一九四六年十一月的一百二十一（战后最高峰），跌到一百一十三点二。
    另据塔斯社报道，由于纽约和伦敦股票和货品价格锐跌，使悉尼股票愈益衰落不振。悉尼证券交易所的股票价格已经有几星期都在下降，达到自一九四六年十一月十七日以来的最低水平。报纸称：在墨尔钵股票交易所的股票也在跌价。
