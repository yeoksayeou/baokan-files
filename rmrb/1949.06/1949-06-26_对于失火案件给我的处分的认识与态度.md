My Understanding and Attitude Towards the Disciplinary Action for the Fire Incident
    Chen Lei
    Comrade Chen Lei is the head of the takeover team at the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant. He was disciplined in this fire incident at the steel plant. He sincerely accepted the disciplinary action and conducted a self-criticism, not only deeply recognizing his shortcomings but also actively proposing to work tenaciously in the future to compensate for the losses to the people and the country. Comrade Chen Lei's spirit of bravely admitting mistakes and using actions to correct shortcomings is good. The self-criticism written by Comrade Chen Lei is published below.
　　　　　　　　　　
　　—Editor
    Since the takeover of the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant, I have failed to rely on and unite with the workers effectively, grasp policies, and have become complacent and relaxed in my work, only taking over without managing. As a result, the property of the state and the people has suffered enormous losses. At the same time, shortcomings in my work have affected the production morale of the workers and damaged our political influence. This is something I should deeply guard against and thoroughly examine.
    Firstly, in terms of economics, apart from a priceless set of analytical tables that cannot be valued, the loss of equipment and buildings alone amounts to more than 42 million RMB. This loss is equivalent to more than 840,000 catties of millet, enough to maintain the minimum wage for 5,000 workers for a month, or the supply for more than 6,600 People's Liberation Army soldiers for a month. It is enough to sustain the lives of more than 11,000 cadres on the supply system for a month, or the rations for about 20,000 poor peasants for a month. What an astonishing figure! How much hard work from the peasants does it take to earn this! I ask myself: as a revolutionary cadre eating the millet of the common people, why have I handled the people's affairs like this? What responsibility have I fulfilled to the people?
    Secondly, and more importantly: Chairman Mao once called on us to increase production by an inch. From the shortcomings in my work, it can be seen that I have failed to deeply understand the spirit of this call and implement it in my work. This is reflected in the fact that I have not gone deep into the masses, relied on the workers, listened to their opinions, educated them, and enlightened their class consciousness to improve the management of the factory. Because I did not adjust the bureaucratic structures and unreasonable phenomena of the past Kuomintang rule in a timely manner, and did not truly consult with the masses on matters, the workers' production morale was affected, and even dissatisfaction was created. This far exceeds the economic losses, because there was a sense of complacency in my thinking. I did not deeply understand that economic struggle is also a form of class struggle. Therefore, the work of preventing spies, special agents, fire, and air raids was not given a high degree of attention in my mind. I did not emphasize and correct the laxity and negligence of production discipline and the spirit of responsibility with a serious attitude, but instead treated it with an attitude of indulgence and neglect. From this incident, I fully realize that all the above tasks are important conditions for ensuring the completion of production tasks. Without these conditions, it is impossible to restore, transform, and develop production well.
    This disciplinary action is precisely a warning sign for me to recognize the shortcomings in my work. I not only accept this disciplinary action, but also face it squarely. From this disciplinary action, I will gain an opportunity for reflection, education, and transformation. At the same time, I will use tenacious work to compensate for the losses to the people's cause.

　　对于失火案件给我的处分的认识与态度
    陈雷
    陈雷同志是石景山钢铁厂接管组负责人，在这次钢铁厂失火案中受到处分。他对处分表示很诚恳地接受，并且进行了自我检讨，不仅深刻认识到自己的缺点，而且更积极地提出今后要顽强地工作来补偿对人民、对国家的损失。陈雷同志这种勇于认过，用行动来改正缺点的精神是好的。现将陈雷同志所写自我检讨一文刊载于后。　　　　　　　　　　
　　—编者
    石景山钢铁厂于接管以来，因自己没有能很好的依靠与团结工人，掌握政策，更加工作麻痹松懈，只接不管，以致使国家人民财产遭受莫大的损失，同时因工作中的缺点更影响了职工的生产情绪，并损害了政治影响，这是自己应该深加警惕与清算的。
    首先在经济上除去一部珍贵的分析表册无法估价外，只器材及房屋的损失竟达四千二百余万人民券。这个损失约等于八十四万余斤小米，能维持五千工人一个月的最低工资，等于六千六百多名解放军一个月的供给；能维持一万一千多供给制干部一个月的生活，也等于约两万贫苦农民一个月的口粮，这是多么惊人的数字，要多少农民辛勤的劳动才能换来！扪心自问：身为革命干部吃着老百姓的小米，为什么把人民的事业搞得这样？对人民负了什么责任？
    其次更重要的是：毛主席曾号召我们，把生产提高一寸，从自己的工作缺点中可以看出，对这一号召没有能深深领会其精神并把它贯彻到工作中去。这表现在没很好的深入群众，依靠工人，听取群众的意见，教育工人启发工人的阶级觉悟，来改善工厂的管理，因为没有及时调整过去国民党统治时期的官僚机构与不合理现象，没有切实作到有事与群众商量，以致影响工人的生产情绪，甚至造成不满情绪，这远超过在经济上的损失，因为在思想上多少存在了太平观念，没有深刻体会到经济斗争也是阶级斗争的一种形式；因此，对防奸、防特、防火、防空的工作在思想上没有提到高度注意。对于生产纪律，负责制的精神的松懈与疏忽，没有以严正的态度来强调，而加以更正，反以迁就忽视的态度来对待。从这次事件里，我充分认识到以上这些工作都是保证生产任务完成的重要条件，没有这些条件要想恢复、改造与发展生产是不可能作得好的。
    这次的处分正是我认清工作缺点的警号，我不但接受这个处分，并且正视这个处分，从这个处分中，使自己得到反省，教育，与改造的机会，同时将以顽强的工作来补偿对人民事业的损失。
    （六月十八日于石景山）
