　　Tianjin Enterprise Rubber Factory Military Representatives and Others
　　Carelessly Produce Defective Shoes; Receive Penalties Including Dismissal
　　[Tianjin News] The rubber factory under the Tianjin Municipal Enterprise Company produced as many as 1,700 pairs of defective shoes in the Second Factory due to the irresponsibility of some production management and technical personnel. This incident should serve as a serious warning to all public-owned factories. According to reports, the vulcanization department of the factory steamed rubber shoes on the afternoon of May 21. When they were taken out of the pot, it was discovered that some of the shoes were defective, with the outsoles and midsoles being soft, as if they hadn't been vulcanized. At this time, factory administrator Sun Yunsheng and military representative Zhang Yinzhen went to the factory headquarters for a meeting. The workers immediately reported to Sun by telephone and investigated the cause of the defective shoes, but production was not stopped. As a result, a total of 1,050 pairs of defective shoes were produced that afternoon. Subsequently, after repeated research by the vulcanization department foreman and others, and after taking the rosin powder (a filler for making rubber) to the nearby Municipal Enterprise Chemical Factory for testing, it was discovered that the quality of the rosin powder was very poor, which caused the shoes to be steamed defectively. This rosin powder had been approved as "usable" by Deng Changming, a technician at the factory headquarters research office, after testing, and was allocated to the No. 1 workshop for use. At that time, Zi Baojun, a worker in the No. 1 workshop's rubber mixing department, pointed out that the quality of this rosin powder was incorrect and refused to use it; however, Deng and Zhao Zhongxuan, the director of the research office, did not re-test it and simply re-allocated it to the No. 2 workshop. After the cause of the defective shoes was determined, the factory administrator and military representative of the No. 2 workshop did not conduct a thorough self-criticism, but only told the workshop to use the original stock of heavy calcium carbonate and proceeded with production. As a result, when work resumed on the 23rd (the 22nd was Sunday), Chen Guojun, the foreman of the rubber mixing department, again made the mistake of empiricism and routinely mixed the defective rubber strips cut off on the 21st into the good rubber, resulting in the continuous discovery of more than 600 additional pairs of defective shoes. After this incident occurred, all the workers in the No. 2 workshop were extremely indignant and unanimously demanded that responsibility be investigated. Subsequently, the factory director, military representative, work team leader, and management personnel and technical heads of the No. 1 and No. 2 workshops held two days of self-criticism meetings. Factory director Wang Luoshu, deputy director Zhang Zanting, military representative Lin Tai, military representative Zhang Yinzhen of the No. 2 workshop, as well as Zhao Zhongxuan, Sun Yunsheng, and others, all conducted self-criticisms. Deng Changming also admitted his mistake. After this incident was reported to the Municipal Enterprise Company, the company's military representative immediately gave Deng Changming the penalty of dismissal. Zhao Zhongxuan, Sun Yunsheng, and others were given warnings or public criticisms, respectively. Zi Baojun, a worker in the No. 1 workshop, was commended for his spirit of refusing to use the rosin powder and being responsible for the people's property. The factory's failure to promptly adjust some unqualified employees (such as Deng Changming) after liberation was also one of the reasons for this incident. The factory has now hired several experienced technicians to engage in testing work. The No. 2 workshop has also established an inspection system to prevent similar incidents from happening again.

　　津企橡胶厂军代表等
  　工作马虎连出坏鞋　分别受到撤职等处分
    【天津讯】津市企业公司所属橡胶厂，由于有些生产管理、技术人员工作不负责任，第二工厂坏鞋竟达一千七百余双之多，这一事件值得目前各公营工厂引为严重警惕。按该场加硫部于五月二十一日下午将胶鞋蒸好，出锅时发现有一部分坏鞋，大底和中膛底是软的，和没有加硫一样。这时工场管理员孙允生和军事代表张银珍到厂本部去开会，职工们当即用电话向孙报告，同时研究坏鞋的原因，但并未停止生产，结果一下午共出坏鞋一千零五十双，继经加硫部工长等反复研究，并拿胡粉（做橡胶的填充剂）到附近市企化学厂化验后，才发现这种胡粉品质甚劣，故把鞋蒸坏。而此项胡粉系经厂本部研究室技术员邓昌明化验后批了“堪用”字样，并将胡粉拨到一工场使用，当时一工场轧胶部工人訾宝俊即指出这胡粉品质不对，拒绝使用；但邓及研究室主任赵仲宣并未再行化验，即改拨到二工场。坏鞋原因究明后，二场工场管理员和军事代表又未深刻检讨，只告诉场里改用原存重炭石，即行了事。以致二十三日上工时（二十二日星期日歇工），轧胶部工长陈国钧又犯了经验主义的错误，照例把二十一日裁下来的坏胶条羼到好胶里去，结果又连续发现坏鞋达六百数十双之多。此事件发生后，二场全体职工极为愤慨，一致要求追究责任。接着，该厂主任、军代表、工作组长和一、二两场管理人员及技术负责人等，接连开了两天检讨会，厂主任王洛书、副主任张赞庭、军代表林泰、二场军代表张银珍及赵仲宣、孙允生等，都分别进行了自我检讨，邓昌明也承认了错误。此事件报告市企业公司后，该公司军事代表当予邓昌明以撤职处分，其余赵仲宣、孙允生等则分别予以警告或当众批评的处分，并对一场工人訾宝俊拒用胡粉，对人民财产负责的精神，加以表扬。按解放后该厂对有些不称职的职员（如邓昌明等）没有及时加以调整，也是此次事件发生的原因之一，现该厂已聘请了几位有经验的技术人员，从事化验工作。二场也建立了检查制度，以防止再有类此事件发生。
