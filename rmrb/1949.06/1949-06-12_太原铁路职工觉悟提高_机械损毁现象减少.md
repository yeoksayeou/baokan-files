　　Railway Workers in Taiyuan Raise Awareness; Mechanical Damage Reduced
　　[Taiyuan Dispatch] The Taiyuan Military Control Commission's Railway Takeover Team has been focusing on educating employees, which has inspired the workers' class consciousness and led to continuous improvements in their work. From May 1st to May 31st, the north and south station locomotive depots employed 1,227 workers and overhauled 85 locomotives. Before liberation, a Class B overhaul required 25 workdays per locomotive, but now it only takes 15. In terms of overhauling passenger and freight cars, 294 cars were overhauled in May, an increase of 150% compared to April before liberation. Class A overhauls, which were impossible before liberation, were performed on 7 cars in May. There has also been significant progress in taking care of machinery. For example, in May, locomotives traveled a total of 54,951 li, and only 9 parts were damaged, including steam pipes, fire grades, wheels, and front frame end beams. This is a 9% reduction compared to the number of parts damaged during the same distance traveled in April before liberation. The number of traffic accidents has also decreased by 33%. The South Station car inspection team, consisting of 26 workers, inspected and repaired 187 cars in May alone. When there were not enough people to handle the workload, they helped each other and volunteered to work overtime. When repairing, if springs or large pads were missing, everyone would remove old ones from damaged cars to replace them. The workers' enthusiasm is mainly due to the Takeover Team's specific organizational work with the workers. The engineering department also seeks workers' opinions everywhere, reports work progress to the workers, and organizes employee groups and study groups to strengthen their education.

　　太原铁路职工觉悟提高
  　机械损毁现象减少
    【太原电】太原军管会铁路接管组注意职工教育，启发了工人阶级觉悟，使工作日益改进。从五月一日至五月三十一日，南北两站机务段，用工一千二百二十七个，即检修机车八十五台。如在解放前乙等检修每台机车须用二十五个工，现在十五个工即可修好。在检修客货车上，五月份共检修了二百九十四辆，较解放前的四月份增加了一倍半。解放前不能进行的甲级检修，五月份检修了七辆。在爱护机器上有也很大进步。如在五月份，机车共行路五万四千九百五十一里，损坏了汽管、火度、车轮、前架端梁等共九件，比解放前四月份行驶同样路程所损坏的机件减少百分之九。行车出事故也减少了百分之三十三。南站检车段修车工人共二十六人，在五月份内即检修了一百八十七辆车，人不够分配，他们便互相帮忙，并自动加班。检修时缺弹簧、大垫等机件，大家从坏车上拆旧的代替。工友们如此积极，主要是由于接管组对工人进行了具体的组织工作，工务段也处处征求工人意见，向工人报告工作情况，并组织了职工小组及学习小组，加强他们的教育。
