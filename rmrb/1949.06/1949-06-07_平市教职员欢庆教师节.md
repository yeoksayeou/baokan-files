　　Ping City Faculty and Staff Celebrate Teachers' Day
    [Our Newspaper] The North Ping City's grand meeting of representatives of faculty and staff from major primary and secondary schools to commemorate the "June 6th" Teachers' Day was solemnly held yesterday (the 6th) at 9:00 AM at the National Grand Theater. This is the first time in history that Ping City teachers have freely and joyfully celebrated their own holiday. Over 1,100 teacher representatives and guests from all walks of life attended the meeting. Chao Zhefu, Liu, Deng Tuo, Fan Wenlan, Shen Junru, Guo Moruo, Lu Zhiwei, Sun Qimeng, and others attended and spoke. At the meeting, four student organizations – the Student Federation, the Second Boys' Middle School, the First Girls' Middle School, and the Third District Central Primary School – warmly presented banners to their teachers. Xue Chengye, Chairman of the Presidium of the Congress, said in his speech: The improvement of teachers' social status today is the result of the Communist Party of China's nearly thirty years of arduous struggle and the heroic fighting of the People's Liberation Army. Liu, Director of the North Ping City Education Bureau, spoke on behalf of the North Ping City People's Government, calling on teachers to strengthen their learning and use new scientific methods to criticize the old education. Chao Zhefu, Minister of Education of the North China People's Government, said: In the future, the people will further demand cultural liberation, which is an important task that teachers must strive to undertake. Comrade Deng Tuo, Minister of Propaganda of the CPC North Ping City Committee, called for thoroughly eliminating feudal remnants and fascist poisons, building a new people's education, serving production and construction, and cultivating a large number of new construction talents. After Shen Junru paid his respects to the teacher representatives, he said: We should create new talents and help the government advance its work, and the most important thing is school education. Guo Moruo praised the teachers as engineers of the soul, pointing out that today's cultural and educational workers should transform their own thinking and then educate the younger generation. Fan Wenlan particularly pointed out the need to step up the elimination of illiteracy and help build rural education. After Lu Zhiwei and Sun Qimeng spoke successively, Ge Zhicheng, Chairman of the Shanghai Primary School Education Association, reported on the situation of teachers in Shanghai. Finally, a representative of the North Ping Student Federation read a dedicatory speech. The conference also passed a telegram to Chairman Mao, Commander-in-Chief Zhu, and the People's Liberation Army.
    In the afternoon, Comrade Zhou Enlai gave a speech to the teacher representatives at the Beijing Hotel, and in the evening, a gala was held in Zhongshan Park to celebrate.
