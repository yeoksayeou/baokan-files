　　Indonesian Guerrillas
  　Focus on Attacking Enemy Transportation
  　And Striking Dutch Imperialist Industrial Production
    [Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 26th] The Dutch authorities in Batavia acknowledged in their weekly commentary published on the 23rd that Indonesian guerrillas are continuing to inflict significant blows on the enemy. The commentary stated: "The chaotic situation throughout Java shows no improvement." It is reported that the activities of the Indonesian guerrillas have recently focused on three areas: attacking Dutch military transportation; dealing with Indonesian local administrative officials who cooperate with the Dutch; and disrupting Dutch industrial and agricultural production. It is claimed that the Dutch "industrial recovery has been greatly damaged," and that the harvesting of mature crops on Dutch plantations is being delayed due to the threat of guerrillas.

　　印尼游击队
  　集中袭敌交通
  　并打击荷帝工业生产
    【新华社北平二十六日电】巴达维亚荷兰官方于二十三日发表的每周评论承认印尼游击队正继续予敌重大打击。该评论称：“整个爪哇的混乱情势仍无改进。”据称，印尼游击队的活动近来集中于三方面：袭击荷军交通；对付与荷兰合作的印尼地方行政官员；破坏荷方工农业生产。据称，荷兰的“工业恢复大大地受到损害”，荷兰种殖园里业已成熟的农作物，正因游击队的威胁而耽误收割。
