　　Industrialist Li Zhuchen, representative of democratic personages, said:
    The old Political Consultative Conference in the past was entirely a performance by the Kuomintang to win American aid and to placate the Communist Party and the people of the whole country. At that time, people from all walks of life in Chongqing held meetings every night in Cangbai Hall, inviting those attending the Political Consultative Conference to attend and report on the progress of the meeting. This shows the urgency of the people's demands, but the pseudo-Kuomintang sent people to disrupt the meetings every night. Finally, at the celebration of the success of the Political Consultative Conference in Hankou, Guo Moruo and Li Gongpu were also injured. Everyone knew that the meeting was a waste of time.
    This new Political Consultative Conference is very different. In the future, a real people's government will be established to develop production. Now that imperialism has been overthrown, there is no need to worry about foreign forces, nor be oppressed by bureaucratic capital. China has a vast territory, a large population, and abundant resources. As long as we lead well and unite from top to bottom, the future will surely be bright.

　　产业界民主人士代表李烛尘先生说：
    过去的旧政协完全是由国民党为了争取美援，敷衍共产党和全国的人民，那时重庆各界人民，每晚在沧白堂开会，邀请参加政协会议的人出席报告会议进行的情形，可见人民要求的迫切，但伪国民党却每晚派人去捣乱，最后在较汉口庆祝政协成功的大会上，把郭沫若、李公朴先生也打伤了，大家就知道那个会是白开的了。
    这次新政协会议是大不相同的。今后要成立真正的人民政府，发展生产。帝国主义打倒了，不必忧愁外国的势力，也不受官僚资本的欺压，中国地广人多，资源丰富，只要好好领导，上下同心，前途一定是光明的。
