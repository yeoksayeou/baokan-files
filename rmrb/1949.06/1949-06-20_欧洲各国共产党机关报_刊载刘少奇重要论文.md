　　European Communist Party Newspapers
　　Publish Liu Shaoqi's Important Essay
    [Xinhua News Agency, Peiping, 19th] The important essay "On Internationalism and Nationalism" by Liu Shaoqi, member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, was published earlier this month in the newspapers of several European Communist Parties. When this article was broadcast by this agency last November, the European side was unable to receive the entire text. After receiving the full English translation of the article in late May, the newspaper of the Information Bureau of European Communist Parties, "For Lasting Peace and People's Democracy," immediately rushed it into print, publishing it in a large space on one page in its June 1st issue. The Soviet "Pravda" also published the full text of the article in a prominent position on the third page of the newspaper for three consecutive days, starting on June 7th. The Czech Communist Party newspaper "Red Power" excerpted and published most of the article on June 5th.

　　欧洲各国共产党机关报
  　刊载刘少奇重要论文
    【新华社北平十九日电】中共中央政治局委员刘少奇所著的重要论文“论国际主义与民族主义”，本月初已先后在欧洲几个国家的共产党机关报刊出。该文于去年十一月间由本社广播时，欧洲方面未能将该文收全。欧洲共产党情报局机关报“争取持久和平与人民民主”报于五月下旬收到该文英译稿全文后，即赶予排印，在该报六月一日出版的一期上以一版的绝大篇幅刊载。苏联“真理报”亦于六月七日起连续三日在该报第三版主要地位刊载该文全文。捷克共产党机关报“红色权力”报于六月五日摘登该文的大部分。
