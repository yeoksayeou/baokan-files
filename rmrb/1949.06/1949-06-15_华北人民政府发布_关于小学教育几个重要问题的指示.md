The North China People's Government Issues Instructions on Several Important Issues Concerning Primary School Education

[This Newspaper Dispatches] The North China People's Government issued instructions today (the 15th) on several important issues concerning primary school education. The original text is as follows:

Instructions of the North China People's Government on Several Important Issues Concerning Primary School Education:

Primary school education is the foundation of national education. North China has been completely liberated, and land reform has been largely completed in all but a few areas. We are beginning to enter a period of peaceful construction, and education work should be greatly developed. To this end, it is urgent to clearly define the guiding principles of primary school education and formulate relatively unified and standardized methods and systems so that primary school education can be improved and popularized more systematically and purposefully. The recent North China Primary School Education Conference has largely fulfilled this task. In addition to drafting the "Provisional Implementation Measures for Primary School Education in the North China Region" and the "Provisional Regulations for the Service of Primary School Teachers in the North China Region," which will be issued separately after review by this government, the following are the revised and approved instructions on the issues of teachers, funding, textbooks, and leadership raised at the conference:

(1) After the guiding principles and methods are determined, teachers are the decisive factor. Therefore, we must first strengthen the learning of in-service primary school teachers to improve quality: (1) Conduct planned rotational training. Provincial normal schools can attach high primary school teacher rotational training classes, and county short-term normal schools can attach junior primary school teacher rotational training classes. The provincial people's government or administrative office should select several counties, each absorbing or transferring 30 to 40 intellectuals for training and assigning them to primary schools as teachers, then replacing them with a corresponding number of people for training in turn. Strive to ensure that all primary school teachers in each county receive a general round of training by the end of next year. Pay attention to guiding primary school teachers in self-study methods and improve their self-study ability in their work. In addition, vacation seminars can be organized. In cities above the secondary level, in addition to vacations, remedial classes can be held at other possible times (such as evenings). (2) Concentrated study alone, without continuous improvement, will still result in limited progress. Therefore, we must also combine teachers' individual self-study, collective mutual assistance, and strengthened leadership to persist in learning in the workplace. This type of learning can generally be organized according to central school districts, with the principal of the central primary school or complete primary school as the team leader. Each group must have two or three people with higher political, cultural, and professional levels to become the core of promoting learning. The county education section must establish a special person (preferably the deputy section chief) and absorb relevant personnel to organize a learning committee to specifically lead the work. The content of in-service learning must meet the needs of teachers, with the principle of "learning what is lacking," without forcing uniformity, and even more so without mechanically applying the set of cadre learning. Different regions should have different priorities. Newly liberated areas generally focus on political and ideological education, while old areas mainly improve cultural and professional levels. (3) Educational publications in various places should strive to gradually play the role of correspondence schools, systematically organize teachers to exchange professional experience, and answer their questions. Try to run formal correspondence schools when possible. Organize book borrowing or small mobile libraries.

Absorb large numbers of intellectuals and train normal school students to supplement the shortage of teachers: (1) There are many intellectuals in large and medium-sized cities, and many are underemployed. After liberation, many have high enthusiasm and are willing to serve the people. They should be given short-term training and assigned appropriate work. Mobilize them to go to the countryside to serve as primary and secondary school teachers. This work needs to be carried out in an organized and planned manner. (2) Conscientiously rectify and gradually develop county (or joint) normal schools. Strengthen leadership and achieve results. Resolutely correct the past tendency to neglect leadership of county normal schools. In terms of the school system, each region should not be forced to be uniform: regions with a shortage of teachers should focus on a one-year system, while regions with less shortage of teachers and more developed culture should focus on a two-year system. Individual counties can be changed to a three-year system. The graduates must be one step higher than the current level of local teachers. Those with uneven levels in the past must carry out class consolidation. Those with poor levels should be compiled into remedial classes, and those with extremely poor levels can be mobilized to return to high primary school to study.

(2) Primary school education must have appropriate development, and funding issues must be further appropriately resolved. After considering the financial situation of the entire region and the needs of local education construction in various regions, the standards and methods for local education funds are stipulated as follows: (1) The ratio of local grain to North China grain is 20 to 100, and education grain should account for about 60% of local grain. In individual areas, if there is a real need in the work, the amount of collection may be appropriately increased with the approval of the provincial government or administrative office, provided that the masses can afford it. (2) The management methods of education grain should be the same as the management methods of secondary education funds. (3) In order to take care of poor areas, the special commissioner's office can make appropriate adjustments to the education grain of each county. (4) Villages without schools should be allowed to raise funds voluntarily to build schools if the masses are truly willing. However, it must be whoever goes to school pays the money, and it is strictly forbidden to apportion it by household. (5) The expenses for school equipment (such as building houses, purchasing desks and chairs, etc.) are uniformly resolved by the local education grain for high primary schools, and are resolved by the village itself with the consent of the masses and the approval of the county government for junior primary schools. For those without school buildings or with insufficient school buildings, public houses such as temples and ancestral halls should be appropriated as soon as possible; or the village government should be responsible for borrowing houses temporarily. When carrying out land reform in newly liberated rural areas, attention should be paid to the confiscated houses, which are suitable for use as classrooms, playgrounds, campuses, or other desks, chairs, and wood, etc., and should be distributed to schools in appropriate amounts with the consent of the masses. As for school buildings occupied by other agencies, and schools have no other place to live, or school buildings are insufficient, they should be returned to the schools. Newly liberated city schools generally do not build new school buildings for the time being. Those houses that must be used and are dangerous if not repaired should be repaired, but accurate budgets must be made and reported to the higher-level government for approval. (6) Expenditure must be planned, systemized, accurately calculated, and frugality must be practiced. Everything must be reasonable. Newly liberated cities should review and revise the unreasonable expenditure methods set by the Kuomintang in the past.

(3) The textbook problem adopts the principle of centralized compilation and review, and decentralized printing: (1) Junior primary school textbooks, regardless of urban or rural areas, will uniformly adopt the combined edition of the Ministry of Education of this government's approved Chinese Language and Common Sense textbooks, volumes 2, 4, 6, and 8, next semester. The first grade of the fall semester will temporarily use the first volume, rural high primary schools can still use volumes 2 and 4 of the high primary school textbooks (approved edition), and high primary schools in large cities will use the latest revised edition. The paper patterns of this revised edition can be sent out. (2) The printing of various textbooks has been uniformly issued with samples or paper patterns, and the propaganda and education departments of each administrative region and province organize local public and private printing forces to supply the needs. The Xinhua General Store supplies Ping, Tianjin, and Shijiazhuang. If there is insufficient printing funds, you can apply for a loan from the bank at the actual price and repay it at the actual price. (3) State-owned bookstores sell textbooks, and the pricing is based on the principle of ensuring that the actual price covers the cost and does not lose money. This price can be determined by each place. (4) Inspect and improve the distribution work to ensure that students receive textbooks in a timely manner.

(4) Based on the past situation of primary school education, improving and strengthening leadership is the most important key to the development of work. In order to overcome existing shortcomings, it is necessary to: (1) Improve the education administrative agencies at all levels, and try to fill the staff according to the establishment and taking into account the quality. (2) Cultivate the professional thinking of education cadres, transfer them as little as possible, so that they accumulate experience and feel at ease to make achievements in their work. Primary school principals and teachers are transferred by the county. County normal school principals and teachers are transferred by the special commissioner's office. Secondary school principals and teachers are transferred by the administrative office (province). The principals and teachers of municipalities directly under the central government are transferred by the municipal government. Normal school graduates should be assigned to education work, and special circumstances must be approved by the higher-level government education department before they can be assigned to other jobs. (3) Pay attention to training female teachers. (4) Strengthen the work of supervision and inspection. Equip strong cadres as supervisors, truly able to discover problems, play a guiding role, and improve work. Conscientiously cultivate typical schools, understand in depth, and provide specific assistance to absorb experience and promote general work. (5) Strengthen the research on New Democracy education business. Conscientiously implement the reporting and requesting instructions system. You should not only request instructions when there are financial difficulties, but freely handle issues of guidelines and policies.

I hope that you will study and implement the above items, and report the implementation situation at any time.

　　华北人民政府发布
  　关于小学教育几个重要问题的指示
    【本报讯】华北人民政府于今（十五）日发出关于小学教育几个重要问题的指示，原文如下：
    华北人民政府关于小学教育几个重要问题的指示：
    小学教育是国民的基础教育。华北已全部解放，除极少地区外，土地改革已大体完成，开始进入和平建设时期，教育工作应有大步开展。为此，明确规定小学教育方针，制订比较统一和正规的办法、制度，以使小学教育更有步骤有计划地提高与普及，已属迫不容缓。最近召开之华北小学教育会议，相当圆满地实现了这一任务，除制定“华北区小学教育暂行实施办法”、“华北区小学教师服务暂行规程”两草案，俟经本府审查另行颁发外，兹对该会议所提出的师资、经费、课本、领导诸方面的问题，修正核准指示如下：
    （一）方针、办法确定后，师资是决定一切的。因此，首先要加强在职小学教师的学习，以提高质量：（１）有计划的轮训。省立师范可附设高小教员轮训班，县立短师可附设初小教员轮训班。省人民政府或行署应选择若干县，每县吸收或抽调知识分子三十至四十人，予以训练，分配任小学教员，再换回相当人数，依次训练。如此轮流，争取明年年底以前，各该县小学教员都能普遍轮训一次。注意指导小学教员自学方法。提高其工作中之自学能力。此外，可利用假期组织讲习会，在中等以上城市，除假期外，还可尽其它可能的时间（如晚上）举办补习班。（２）只有集中学习，缺乏平时进修，进步仍属有限。因此还必须以教师个人自学、集体互助、加强领导三者相结合的方法，坚持工作中的学习。此种学习，一般可按中心学区编组，中心小学校长或完小校长为组长，每组必须有两三个政治、文化、业务水平较高者，成为推动学习的核心。县教育科须设专人（最好是副科长）并吸收有关人员组织学习委员会，专门负责领导。在职学习的内容，必须切合教员的需要，以“缺啥学啥”为原则，不强求一致，更不应机械搬运干部学习的一套。不同地区应有不同重点，新解放区一般是着重政治思想教育，而老区则主要是提高文化业务水平。（３）各地的教育刊物，争取逐渐起函授学校的作用，有计划地组织教师交流业务经验，解答他们提出的疑难问题。可能时试办正式函授学校。组织图书互借或小型流动图书馆。
    大量吸收知识分子，培养师范学生，以补充师资的不足：（１）大、中城市知识分子为数很多，且人浮于事。解放后，不少的是热情很高，愿意为人民服务，应加以短期训练，分配适当工作。动员他们到农村去任中小学教师。这一工作需要有组织有计划地进行。（２）切实整顿，逐步发展县立（或联立）师范，要加强领导，做出成绩。切实纠正过去忽视对县师领导的偏向。在学制上，各区不强求一致：教师缺乏的地区，以一年制为主，教师不太缺乏且文化较发达的地区，以二年制为主，个别县份可以改为三年制，要做到毕业生比当地教师现有水平高出一步。过去程度过于参差不齐者，必须进行班级的整顿，程度差的另编补习班，个别程度太差的，可动员回高小学习。
    （二）小学教育要有适当的发展，又必须进一步适当解决经费问题，兹斟酌全区财政情况及各区地方教育建设需要，规定地方教育费标准和办法如下：（１）地方粮与华北粮的比例为二十比一百，教育粮应占地方粮百分之六十左右。个别地区，工作上确有需要，在群众负担能力许可下，经省政府或行署批准，征收数得酌量增加。（２）教育粮的掌管办法，应与中等教育经费之掌管办法同。（３）为照顾贫苦地区，专署对各县教育粮可作适当调剂。（４）无学校的村庄，群众确系自愿集资兴学者，应允许之。但须谁入学谁出钱，严禁按户摊派。（５）学校设备的开支（如盖房、购置桌凳等）高小由地方教育粮统一解决，初小经群众同意，县府批准由村自行解决。凡无校舍或校舍不足者，若有公共房屋如庙宇、祠堂等，应尽先拨用；或由村政府负责暂为借房。在新解放农村进行土改时，应注意没收的房屋中，有适用为教室、操场、校园者，或其他桌凳、木材等，可征求群众同意，酌量分配给学校。至于校舍被其他机关占用，而学校别无住处，或校舍不足者，应退还学校。新解放城市学校，一般暂不新建校舍，其必须使用之房屋不修理即发生危险者则当加以修理，但须制定精确预算，报请上级政府批准。（６）经费开支必须有计划、有制度、精确计算，厉行节约，一切要做到合理。新解放城市对过去国民党所定之开支办法，不合理的应加审查修订。
    （三）课本问题采集中编审、分散印行的原则：（１）初小课本，不论城乡，下学期一律采用本府教育部审定的国语常识合编本二、四、六、八册，秋季始业之一年级暂用第一册，乡村高小可仍用高小课本（审定本）之二、四册，大城市的高小改用最近的修订本，此种修订本的纸型即可发去。（２）各种课本的印刷，已经统一发给样本或纸型，由各行政区、省宣教部门组织当地公私印刷力量，供应需用。平、津、石则由新华总店供应。印刷资金不足，可向银行折实贷款，借实还实。（３）公营书店销售课本，定价以实物保本不致赔钱为原则，此项价格，各地可自行规定。（４）检查改进发行工作，保证及时使学生获得课本。
    （四）根据过去小学教育情况，改进加强领导是工作开展的最重要关键。为克服现存缺点，必须：（１）健全各级教育行政机构，应按编制并顾及质量，设法补充满员。（２）培养教育干部的专业思想，尽可能的少调动，使积累经验，安心将工作作出成绩。小学校长教员由县调动。县师校长教员由专署调动。中等学校校长教员由行署（省）调动。直辖市之校长教员由该市政府调动。师范毕业学生应分配教育工作，特殊情况须经上级政府教育部门同意，始可分配其他工作。（３）注意培养女教师。（４）加强视导检查工作。配备强干部作视导员，真正做到能发现问题，发挥指导作用，提高工作。认真培养典型学校，深入了解，具体帮助，以吸取经验推动一般。（５）加强新民主主义教育业务的研究。认真执行报告请示制度，不应只在经费困难时才请示，而对方针、政策问题反而自由处理。
    以上各项，希即研究执行，并将执行的情况随时报告。
