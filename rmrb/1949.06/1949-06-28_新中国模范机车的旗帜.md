The banner of model locomotives in New China
Chen Ji

    New China's railways are growing stronger. The people's locomotives, under the most scientific locomotive responsibility system, have achieved astonishing development. Since the Northeast Railway implemented the responsibility system on September 28th of last year, overcoming the past phenomena of disorder, backwardness, conservatism, and irregularity, the daily car mileage has gradually increased from 140-150 kilometers to 336 kilometers. The highest record for some model locomotives has even reached 780 kilometers. In terms of technical speed, it has generally increased to 33.1 kilometers (March statistics), with the highest record for individual model locomotives reaching 38 to 53 kilometers, exceeding the standards of the puppet Manchurian and Kuomintang reactionary rule. There have also been significant gains in saving oil, fuel, and materials. More than 30 model locomotives have emerged in the Northeast, creating rich experiences. At the National Locomotive Affairs Conference, which opened on June 27th, Minister of Railways Teng Daiyuan said that it is necessary to establish the banner of the crew responsibility system, taking the "Mao Zedong," "Iron Ox," and "884" locomotives as the banner of model locomotives for the whole country's railways. This glorious banner will drive the progress of New China's railways.
    The "Mao Zedong" locomotive was built by workers at the Harbin Locomotive Depot in Northeast China in October 1946. They named it "Mao Zedong" to thank Chairman Mao for liberating them. Initially driven by Chen Jiesan, it was later managed by labor hero Li Yong. Under his leadership, careful oiling, meticulous maintenance, and enthusiastic care kept the locomotive in consistently new condition. From January 1947 to February 1949, it traveled 139,218 kilometers without any responsibility accidents. It was selected as a "Model Locomotive Group" in the labor model movement held in the Northeast in 1947. When the standard mileage was set at 5,000 kilometers per month, it exceeded 6,000 kilometers per month. When the Railway Bureau celebrated its achievements, it was rated as a collective great merit and awarded a banner. In September 1948, the Railway Bureau set the Class A inspection mileage at 35,000 kilometers, but it extended it by more than 19,600 kilometers. In December of the same year, when the new traffic system began to be implemented, it created a technical speed of 41.8 kilometers for the first time, the highest record in Harbin. In January 1949, it created a record of traveling 10,417 kilometers, exceeding the bureau's standard mileage by one-third. During the trial implementation of the locomotive circulation system, its stay in the depot was shortened to 15 minutes. These brilliant achievements established its leading position among locomotives. On March 27th, it traveled from the Northeast to Fengtai, where it was warmly cheered and loved by railway worker brothers from all over the country. It led the Fengtai locomotive workers to work enthusiastically, and the Fengtai "May 1st Labor" locomotive was finally born on April 24th. From the day it accepted transport tasks on May 2nd, it achieved an average daily car mileage of 292.94 kilometers, a maximum daily car mileage of 605.1 kilometers, an average technical speed of 37.9 kilometers, and a maximum of 50 kilometers in May. This glorious achievement can undoubtedly be said to have grown up under the influence of the Mao Zedong locomotive.
    The Iron Ox locomotive was originally the dilapidated No. 96 locomotive of the Suihua Locomotive Depot in Northeast China. When the People's Liberation Army was about to liberate Sipingjie, the workers enthusiastically supported the front, using their spare time to work two extra hours every day, and repaired it from mid-July to August 5, 1947. After the driver Lin Xiantang took charge, he united all the team members and carefully looked after the locomotive, never being careless in driving, oiling, washing the furnace, and repairing. As soon as there was the slightest problem, it was repaired immediately. The No. 96 locomotive gradually grew stronger, and the responsibility system achieved results. From August 7th of the previous year to February 14th of this year, it traveled 106,579 kilometers in eighteen months and seven days without a Class A inspection and without any responsibility accidents. At the celebration meeting of the Suihua Locomotive Depot in Northeast China, it received the award flag, bonuses, and prizes from the Northeast Railway Bureau, and the director of the Harbin Railway Bureau personally held a naming ceremony and gave it the name "Iron Ox."
    The 884 locomotive is a locomotive assigned to the Hailar Locomotive Depot of the Qiqihar Railway Administration. It is the responsibility of drivers Zhang Zhongye, Li Zhongchun, and Ai Xikui. They worked hard to be responsible for maintenance and operation, so it traveled safely for 110,100 kilometers without a single obstacle, exceeding the two Class A inspection periods of the Northeast Railway Bureau (one Class A inspection period is stipulated as 50,000 kilometers). The average daily car mileage in March of this year was 495 kilometers, exceeding the Northeast Bureau's standard daily car mileage of 422 kilometers, exceeding the puppet Manchurian daily car mileage of 239 kilometers by 110 percent. The highest daily car mileage reached 748.8 kilometers. The average technical speed in March was 39.3 kilometers, and the highest technical speed was 53.3 kilometers. Within three months of implementing the new traffic system, the time saved by arriving early at the station could produce 14 and a half more trains.

　　新中国模范机车的旗帜
    陈迹
    新中国的铁路在壮大中，人民的机车，在最科学的机务负责制度下，得到了惊人的发展。东北铁道自从去年九月二十八日实行了负责制，克服了过去紊乱、落后、保守和不正规的现象后，日车公里由一百四五十公里逐渐提高到三百三十六公里，有些典型机车的最高纪录竟达到七百八十公里，在技术速度方面一般提高到三十三点一公里（三月份统计），个别典型机车的最高纪录达到三十八公里至五十三公里，超过了伪满及国民党反动统治时代的标准；在节约油脂、燃料、材料方面，亦有显著的收获。东北的模范机车已涌出了三十多台，创造了丰富的经验。在六月二十七日开幕的全国机务会议上，铁道部滕代远部长说，要树立乘务负责制的旗帜，以毛泽东号、铁牛号、八八四号三台机车，为全国铁道模范机车的旗帜。这个光辉的旗帜将带动着新中国铁路前进。
    “毛泽东号”机车是一九四六年十月东北哈尔滨机务段工人修建的，他们感谢解放他们的毛主席，特地定命“毛泽东号”。初由陈捷三驾驶，后由劳动英雄李永负责，在他的领导下，给油周到，检修仔细，热心爱护，机车状态一贯如新。从一九四七年一月至一九四九年二月走了十三万九千二百一十八公里，从未出过责任事故。在一九四七年东北举行的劳模运动中被选为“模范机车组”。在标准公里定为每月五千公里时，它每月超过六千公里。铁路局庆功时，评为集体大功，赠以锦旗。一九四八年九月铁路局定甲检公里为三万五千公里，它却延长了一万九千六百余公里。同年十二月新行车制开始实行，它首次创造了四十一点八公里技术速度，为哈尔滨的最高纪录。一九四九年一月它创造走行了一万零四百一十七公里的纪录，超过局标准公里的三分之一，在试行机车循回制时，它在库停留时间缩短到十五分钟。这些辉煌成就，造成了它的机车领袖地位。三月二十七日，它从东北开到丰台，受到各地铁路工人兄弟的热烈欢呼与爱戴。它领导着丰台机车工人热情工作，丰台的“五一劳动号”机车终于在四月二十四日诞生了。这个机车从五月二日接受运输任务的那天起，五月份造成平均日车公里二百九十二点九四公里，最高日车公里六百零五点一公里，平均技术速度三十七点九公里，最高达五十公里。这种光荣成绩，不能不说是在毛泽东号机车的影响下成长起来的。
    铁牛号机车原是东北绥化机务段的九十六号破烂机车，当人民解放军要解放四平街时，工人们热情支前，利用业余时间，每天多干两个钟头，于一九四七年七月中旬至八月五日把它修复。司机长林先汤包乘以后，团结全体组员，细心看护这台机车，在行车、给油、洗炉、检修等工作中，一点都不马虎。只要有丝毫的毛病，马上就修理。九十六号机车渐渐的壮大起来，负责制收到了效果。前年八月七日起，到今年二月十四日止，在十八个月零七天中，它行走了十万零六千五百七十九公里，没有甲检，没有出过责任事故。在东北绥化机务段的庆功会上，得到了东北铁路总局的奖旗，奖金和奖品，并经哈尔滨铁路局长亲自举行命名式，给了它一个“铁牛号”的名称。
    八八四号机车，是齐齐哈尔铁路管理局海拉尔机务段的配属机车，由司机张忠业、李仲春、艾希奎负责包乘，他们努力负责检修操纵，所以它安全行走了十一万零一百公里，未发生过一次障碍，超过了东北铁路总局两次甲检期（一次甲检期规定为五万公里）。日车公里本年三月份平均为四百九十五公里，超过东北总局标准日车公里四百二十二公里，超过了伪满日车公里二百三十九公里的百分之一百一十。其最高日车公里曾达七百四十八点八公里。技术速度三月份平均为三十九点三公里，最高技术速度为五十三点三公里。它在执行新行车制度的三个月内，因提前到站所节省的时间，可多出十四半列车。
