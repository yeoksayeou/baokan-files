　　Preparatory Committee of Pingguo Pharmaceutical Factory Trade Union
 　　Discusses Organizational Leadership Issues
 　　[Our Newspaper] The Preparatory Committee of the Ping Municipal National Pharmaceutical Industry Trade Union held its first preparatory committee meeting yesterday afternoon. More than 30 members of the preparatory committee attended. In addition to reporting on the recent preparatory work carried out separately below and the feedback from the masses, the committee members focused on the preparatory committee's leadership and organization of all employees in the national pharmaceutical industry, as well as the work plan to resolve labor-capital disputes in the spirit of benefiting both labor and capital. On the leadership aspect, everyone agreed that the preparatory committee should be the core of leadership, and everyone should fully rely on the masses to promote democracy, centralizing opinions from below for collective discussion and decision-making in the preparatory committee to be implemented. In terms of organization, a trade union should be established with each store or factory as a unit (affiliated stores should be regarded as one unit). A major issue in the work plan at present is that each pharmacy should calculate costs based on its own situation, in order to propose a draft for labor wages, the pure profit of capital, and the rights of employees in other aspects, for further joint research with the draft proposed by the capital side, and to resolve all issues between labor and capital. Finally, Comrade Xiao Ming, Director of the Ping Municipal Federation of Trade Unions, clarified an issue: that is, in organizing the trade union, all personnel who were at or above the district committee level of the Kuomintang in the past do not have civil rights, and therefore are not qualified to join the trade union. These people, after registration and review by the Public Security Bureau, can join the trade union after transformation and verification that they have changed and regained their civil rights. Kuomintang secret service personnel and group leaders and above are subject to the same restrictions.

　　平国药业职工筹委会
  　讨论组织领导问题
    【本报讯】平市国药业职工筹备会于昨日下午召开第一次筹备委员会议，到有筹委三十余人，各筹委除汇报最近分头在下面的酝酿工作及群众反映外，曾着重就筹备会对国药业全体职工的领导、组织，以及本劳资两利的精神解决劳资纠纷的工作计划作了详细讨论。在领导方面，大家一致意见：要以筹委会为领导核心，大家要充分依靠群众发扬民主，从下面集中起来在筹委会集体讨论，作出决定来执行。在组织方面，要以一店或厂为单位（联号应划为一个单位）成立职工会。在工作计划中的一个主要问题，当前即为各药店根据本店的情况计算成本，以便提出劳方工资，资方纯利，以及职工其他各方面的权利的草案，进一步与资方所提草案共同研究，解决劳资间的一切问题。最后平市职工总会主任萧明同志讲明了一个问题，即在组织职工会时，凡过去的国民党区委以上的人员，均无公民权，因此也就没有资格加入职工会，这些人，经过公安局登记审查之后，经过改造，确有转变，恢复了公民权仍可加入职工会，国民党特务人员，小组长以上的人员与以上同。
