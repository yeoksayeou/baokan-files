　　Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, 27th: Ye Yizhou, Commissioner of the Kuomintang Central Bureau of Investigation and Statistics Nanjing District, has confessed to the People's Government and surrendered two pistols, ninety-nine bullets, and Kuomintang party cards, investigation certificates, special badges and other documents. The People's Government, based on the policy of "punishing the ringleaders, not questioning the coerced, and rewarding meritorious service," has given him lenient treatment. Ye Yizhou is from Anqing, Anhui. In 1937, he joined the Kuomintang Nanjing Central Bureau of Statistics and engaged in top-secret telegraph work. In 1938, he joined the Kuomintang and successively served as a telegraph operator, intelligence investigator, head of the action section, and commissioner. After the Kuomintang retreated south this time, he hid in Nanjing, originally planning to continue his consistent criminal activities. In his letter of repentance, he confessed to the many crimes of the Kuomintang secret agents and himself, and put forward a guarantee to perform meritorious service for the people to atone for his crimes. The People's Government will handle the case leniently and allow him to atone for his crimes through meritorious service.

    【新华社南京二十七日电】国民党中央党部调查统计局南京区专员叶一舟，已向人民政府悔过，并缴出手枪两支，子弹九十九发及国民党党证、调查证、特种证章等证件。人民市政府本“首恶必办，胁从不问，立功受奖”的政策，已给予宽大处理。叶一舟安徽安庆人，一九三七年即参加国民党南京中统局任极密股报务工作，一九三八年加入国民党，曾历任报务员、情报调查员、行动科长、专员等职。此次国民党南撤后，他即隐匿南京市，原准备继续其一贯的罪恶活动。他在悔过书中，供出了国民党特务及他自己的许多罪恶事实，并提出要为人民立功赎罪的保证。人民政府将从宽处理，允其将功赎罪。
