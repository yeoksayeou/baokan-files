Xinhua News Agency, Peiping, 26th. Guangzhou Central News Agency's 15th dispatch from Guangzhou's Southwest Daily and Hong Kong's airmail news reported "Details of Zhang Zhizhong being detained by the Communists in Peiping." Subsequently, Guangzhou Central News Agency's 20th and 22nd dispatches twice attacked and slandered General Zhang Zhizhong and others. General Zhang Zhizhong, currently residing in Peiping, hereby issues the following statement regarding this matter:

　　These few dispatches are full of nonsense and lies, and there is no need to refute them. However, since coming to Peiping, I have received much care from comrades and friends from various places, and I would like to take this opportunity to say a few words.

　　In reality, I am now living a leisurely and comfortable life in Peiping; and a sense of joy and comfort is growing day by day. What is the reason? I have been residing in Peiping for eighty days now, and from what I have seen and heard, I feel that a new transformation and a new trend are revealed everywhere, symbolizing that the future of our country and nation has shown new hope. That is, the CCP, with its more than twenty years of struggle experience, deeply understands the essentials of serving the people and building the country, and has a strict system of criticism, a spirit of learning, and a practical, hardworking, and steady work style. These advantages, reflected in political facilities, are efficient and corruption-free governments. Reflected in the actions of party members, are frugal, hardworking, and pragmatic military and political cadres. In particular, the New Democracy advocated by the CCP, in the current stage, is in line with the basic points of our revolutionary Three People's Principles. To sum it up in one sentence, none of this could be achieved by the political facilities and actions of party members that our Kuomintang demonstrated in the past. As a member of the Kuomintang, I can only feel infinite shame; but standing on the position of a national citizen, I feel great comfort. We Chinese people, after all, still have the ability to reverse the national crisis, and it is still hoped that the country can be managed well, proving that it is not a nation without promise. The accumulated bitterness in my heart for many years has been swept away, and I have truly gained spiritual liberation, how can I not be comforted!

　　I would also like to especially point out to my concerned comrades: The breakdown of this peace talk is seen by some people in our Kuomintang as the conditions being too harsh, akin to surrender. In fact, to be fair, these eight principles were the basis for the peace talks that the then Acting President Li of the Nanjing government had already acknowledged, and the twenty-four articles were the specific measures for implementing these eight principles. During the negotiation period, our delegation had earnestly consulted with the CCP representatives and put forward more than forty written amendments, more than half of which were accepted by the CCP. For example, only making principle stipulations for war criminals, without mentioning any names at all, is one example of the CCP's greatest concessions. And it was verbally agreed that if the Nanjing government agreed to sign at that time, textual modifications could still be made. If we recognize the inevitable situation of defeat and seeking peace, and can also understand the historical routine of regime change, then the revolutionary righteousness, the world is for the common good, since we are incompetent, we should give way to the capable; since we are unsuccessful, we should give way to the successful. Because domestic wars are among compatriots, who wins and who loses is not the same as foreign countries. Imagine the late Qing Dynasty, if it were not for our Mr. Sun Yat-sen calling for revolution and overthrowing autocracy, wouldn't China have long been subjected to the carve-up and co-management of imperialism? The Kuomintang has been in power for more than twenty years and has ended up in this situation, which is not accidental. Of course, as a cadre of the Kuomintang, I must also bear a responsibility. Therefore, today, we should sincerely admit our mistakes, courageously admit failure, and frankly give up power. People's perception will look at us differently and re-evaluate us because of this frank and straightforward attitude. I earnestly hope that the Kuomintang Central Committee and responsible comrades in various places can make good use of reason, face reality squarely, reflect on themselves with a self-reproaching mind, and plan to rein in at the precipice; show compassion for the people, endure humiliation and bear heavy burdens, reduce sacrifices for the military and civilians, and preserve more vitality for the country. Although it is not yet the latest, it has indeed reached the final opportunity, and it is not advisable to lightly ignore it and let it pass. If we are still ignorant of the hearts of the people and the general trend, and continue to wage a hopeless war, the result will only damage the masses and harm ourselves, which is unsolvable!

　　Although I am in Peiping, my heart is with the war zone. Looking back on my personal views, I have always advocated implementing the revolution and carrying out democratic politics. After the September 18th Incident, I strongly advocated national unity and resolute resistance against Japan. On domestic issues, I strongly advocated resolving them through political means to promote peace. These are all commonly seen and heard by everyone. At present, the overall situation has evolved to this point. I feel that comrades in various places should learn from the past and be careful in the future, make a decisive decision, and resolutely express their sincere cooperation with the CCP, and jointly strive for the realization of Mr. Sun Yat-sen's revolutionary Three People's Principles, that is, the CCP's New Democracy. As for our Kuomintang, it should have been thoroughly reformed long ago to promote a new life in order to adapt to the times, create the times, and achieve the historical mission that our revolutionaries should bear. At present, if we broaden our horizons, expand our minds, think of everything for the benefit of the country and the nation, and think of everything for the happiness of future generations, we not only have no need to be pessimistic, but also have reasons to be optimistic. The country is asking for a new life, and is also being reborn. The people are asking for a new life, and are also being reborn. Why should our Kuomintang and individuals alone lag behind and not be reborn!?

　　张治中将军声明
    【新华社北平廿六日电】广州中央社十五日电传广州西南日报香港航讯，曾报导“张治中在北平被共产党扣留之详情”，接着，广州中央社二十日二十二日两次电讯，又对张治中将军等进行攻击和诽谤。现居北平之张治中将军特为此事发表声明如左：
    这几篇电讯，一派胡言诳语，没有驳斥的必要。不过，我来平以后，颇承各地同志及友好关怀，我倒想就这个机会说几句话。
    实在说起来，我现在北平所过着的是闲适自在的生活；而且引起一种欣喜安慰的情绪，与日俱增。为什么缘由呢？我居留北平已八十天了，以我所见所闻的，觉得处处显露出一种新的转变，新的趋向，象征着我们国家民族的前途已显出新的希望。就是中共以二十多年的奋斗经验，深得服务人民建设国家的要领，并且具有严格的批评制度，学习精神，和切实、刻苦、稳健的作风。这些优点，反映到政治设施的，是有效率的，没有贪污的政府。反映到党员行动的，是检朴、肯干、实事求是的军政干部。尤其中共所倡导的新民主主义，在现阶段看来，实与我革命的三民主义之基本要点相符合。综合说一句，这都不是过去我们国民党所表现于政治设施和党员行动所能做到的。我以国民党员一分子的立场，只有感到无限的惭疚；但是站在国民一分子的立场说，又觉得极大的欣慰。我们中国人，毕竟还有能力把国家危机挽转过来，还可希望把国家搞好，断不是一个没有出息的民族，已可得到证明。我多年来内心所累积的苦闷，为之一扫而空，真是精神上获得了解放，怎能不令人欣慰不已呢？
    我再要为关心我的同志们特别指出：这次和谈破裂，在我们国民党内有些人认为条件太苛，类似投降。其实平情而论，这八条原则早为当时南京政府李代总统所承认的和谈基础，二十四款就是实行这八条原则的具体办法。在谈判期间，我们代表团已经和中共代表恳切磋商，并提出书面修正意见四十余处，被中共接受过半数。如战犯只作原则规定，名单完全不提，就是中共最大让步之一例。并且口头约定，如果当时南京政府同意签字，还可作文字上的修改。倘我们认识战败求和的必然情势，又能了然于政权更迭的历史常例，则革命大义，天下为公，我们自己既然无能，就应该让给有能的；自己既然无成，就应该让给有成的。因为国内战争，本属同胞，谁得谁失，非同异国。试想满清末季，要是没有我们孙先生号召革命，推翻专制，中国不早就遭受了帝国主义的瓜分共管了吗？我们国民党执政二十多年竟弄到现在这样地步，也不是偶然的事。当然，我是国民党的干部，也要负一份责任。所以，我们今日，就应该以诚意承认错误，以勇气承认失败，坦然放弃政权，则人民观感将为我们这种坦白率真的态度而另眼相看，重新评价。甚望我们国民党中央和各地负责同志能够善用理智，正视现实，以反省自咎的胸襟，作悬崖勒马的打算；悲天悯人，忍辱负重，为军民减少牺牲，为国家多保元气。现在虽未为最晚，实已到了最后机会，万不宜轻忽的听其错过。如果还是昧于人心与大势所趋，继续作毫无希望的战争，其结果徒然损伤了大众，贻害了自己，这是无从索解的！
    本人虽然身在北平，而心念战区。回想个人的主张，一向力主贯彻革命，实行民主政治。九一八变起以后，力主全国团结，坚决抗战，对国内问题，力主以政治方式解决，促成和平。这些，都是大家共见共闻的。目前，大局已演变到此。我觉得，各地同志们，应该惩前毖后，当机立断，毅然决然表示与中共推诚合作，为孙先生的革命三民主义，亦即为中共新民主主义的实现而共同努力。至于我们国民党，早就应彻底改造，促进新生，才能适应时代，创造时代，达成我们革命党人应负的历史使命。在目前，我们如果把眼光放远些，心胸放大些，一切为国家民族利益着想，一切为子孙万代幸福着想，我们不但没有悲观的必要，而且还有乐观的理由。国家要求新生，也正在新生。人民要求新生，也正在新生。为什么我们国民党和个人，独甘落后，不能新生呢！？
