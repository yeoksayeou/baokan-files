　　Hong Kong Compatriots Recall the Grand Celebrations in Hong Kong After the Liberation of Beijing, Shanghai, and Hangzhou Amidst Jubilation
    Hu Xingyuan
    The news of the People's Liberation Army crossing the Yangtze River reached Hong Kong on the afternoon of April 21st, the same day Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu issued the order to advance. The streets were crowded with people scrambling to buy extra editions of newspapers. Some people didn't even wait for change, throwing down a dollar for a newspaper that originally cost one dime. Vendors in Li Yuan East and West Streets and Ge Lin Street almost all bought a copy. The inside and outside of the newspaper offices were packed with people eager to buy the extra editions. Citizens along Hollywood Road and other areas waiting for good news formed a sea of people, not dispersing until late at night.

    Cultural workers and the 100,000 progressive laborers who remained in Hong Kong were the first to take action. Poets like Ma Fantuo immediately wrote poems praising the river crossing, and composers immediately composed songs like "Millions of Soldiers March South of the Yangtze" and "Welcoming the River Crossing." Painters put forward the slogan "Paste posters all over Jiangnan." During weekend forums, dozens of young reporters unanimously resolved to "redouble our efforts to fight against the fleeing Chiang Kai-shek bandits' 'White China' to cooperate with the river-crossing campaign." Under the leadership of the Federation of Trade Unions, Hong Kong and Kowloon workers universally launched a campaign to strengthen learning, welcoming the birth of the new China.

    The news of the People's Liberation Army's liberation of Nanjing on April 23rd brought even greater joy to the compatriots in Hong Kong.

    On the third day after the army entered Nanjing, Qiao Mu and Gong Peng, the heads of the Hong Kong branch of Xinhua News Agency, held a grand cocktail party in the Hong Kong Hotel to celebrate the liberation of Nanjing. On the evening of the 27th, people from the press and cultural circles held another grand celebratory dinner at the Jinling Restaurant. Although this gathering was decided only the night before, more than 800 people poured in the next day. Everyone wore a red flower on their chest. During the event, more than 200 people danced the Yangko enthusiastically. Musicians composed a "Celebrating Victory" tune on the spot, which was immediately broadcast over the microphone. All the attendees performed a grand chorus of 800 people. Friends working in theater turned the scene into a call-and-response skit, which was broadcast and sung immediately. Literary writers at the meeting proposed a creation competition, and poets like Ma Fantuo collectively wrote "Cheering for Victory," while Shi Yi and others immediately composed a song called "Let Us Sing Loudly." Youngsters also did not lag behind. The singing teams of the "Hua Shang Bao" and "Wen Hui Bao" enthusiastically launched a singing competition, singing "Forever Following the Chinese Communist Party" and "Our Troops Have Arrived." Hundreds of rounds of applause and cheers shook the entire Tangxi district. Countless windows of tall buildings around the Jinling Building were filled with people moved by the enthusiastic waves of celebratory songs. Even the cooks of the Jinling Restaurant and the waiters of other buildings squeezed onto the escalators of the building to join in the fun. Despite the Hong Kong government's heavy restrictions, many people fervently shouted "Long Live Chairman Mao, Long Live Commander-in-Chief Zhu" and "Long Live the Chinese Communist Party." The meeting did not end until late at night, in the midst of wild Yangko dancing, singing, clapping, and shouting "Attack Guangzhou."

    The most jubilant were the 100,000 progressive laborers in Hong Kong and Kowloon. Until the reporter left Hong Kong in early June, major industrial and vocational trade unions were still constantly holding gatherings, dinners, and trips to celebrate the great victory of the Chinese people. Every night, the trade unions were filled with songs praising victory. Tram, electricity, telephone, dock, seaman, yarn factory... more than 30 units formed an opera troupe. The main content of the Hong Kong and Kowloon Federation of Trade Unions' "May 1st" celebration was to celebrate the victory of the working class and peasant brothers in the motherland. More than 1,500 representatives of workers from various factories attended. The venue occupied the two-story building of Jinling Restaurant, and the inside and outside of the venue were packed. The celebration called on Hong Kong and Kowloon workers to start a patriotic upsurge, unite as one, and strive to welcome the birth of new China. In the entertainment program, female workers from the British American Tobacco Company performed a grand dance praising the new China, "Democratic China is Born," naval dock workers performed a dance expressing the heroic struggle of the Chinese people, "Day is Breaking," and a large chorus of more than 500 workers. The meeting lasted from 8:00 a.m. to 4:00 p.m.

    The youth of Hong Kong and Kowloon were equally ecstatic about the great victory of the People's Liberation Army. During this period, more than 50 singing groups celebrated the liberation of Beijing and Shanghai and the march to South China in the great outdoors.

    The news of the People's Liberation Army entering Shanghai reached Hong Kong on the morning of May 26th. This news brought the jubilation of Hong Kong compatriots celebrating the victory of the People's Liberation Army to a climax. The frenzied celebrations of workers, youth, students, cultural circles, and citizens are simply indescribable in words and language.

    Countless compatriots who had fled to Hong Kong under the persecution of the Kuomintang bandit gang were preparing to buy boats to return to their newborn motherland. Sidewalks, ferries, and tea houses were filled with the Shanghainese dialect question, "When are you going back to Shanghai?"

    The jubilation of Hong Kong compatriots after the People's Liberation Army marched into Jiangnan reflects the firm belief of countless compatriots in building a new China and their respect and love for the leaders of this great revolutionary movement—Chairman Mao, Commander-in-Chief Zhu, and the Chinese Communist Party. The compatriots' eager expectation for a free motherland is unprecedented in history.

　　香港侨胞在狂欢中
  　追记京、沪、杭解放后香港祝捷盛况
    胡星原
    人民解放军渡江的消息在四月二十一日毛主席朱总司令颁布进军命令的当日下午就传到了香港。街头到处挤满了抢购号外的人群。有的人来不及等找尾数，原本一毫子一份的号外，买的人丢了一块钱就走了。在利源东西街、阁麟街一带的摊贩，几乎人人买了一份号外。报馆的里里外外都挤满了抢购号外的人。荷里活道一带等候好消息的市民汇成了人海，直到深夜始散。
    留在香港的文化工作者和十万进步劳工首先行动起来。诗人马凡陀等立即写出了歌颂渡江的诗作，作曲家立即谱出了“百万雄师下江南”、“迎接渡江”等歌曲。画家们提出了“把招贴画贴遍江南”的号召。外勤新闻记者周末座谈中，几十位青年记者一致决议“为配合渡江进军，要加倍努力与逃亡香港的蒋匪‘白华’作战”。港九工人在工联会的领导下，普遍地展开加强学习运动，迎接新中国的诞生。
    人民解放军四月二十三日解放南京的捷报，使香港的侨胞喜上添喜。
    大军进驻南京城的第三天，香港新华分社主持人乔木、龚澎在香港大酒店客厅举行了庆祝南京解放的盛大的鸡尾酒会。二十七日晚上，新闻、文化各界又在金陵酒家举行了一次盛大的祝捷大聚餐。虽然这次集会头天晚上才决定，但第二天竟涌来了八百余人。每人衣襟上都带着红花。席间，二百多人欢狂地大扭秧歌。音乐家们当场创作了一个“庆祝胜利”的曲子，即时，在麦克风前广播。与会者全体演出了八百人的大合唱。做戏剧工作的朋友将当场的情形变成了对唱活报，即时播唱。文艺作家在会上提出创作竞赛的挑战，诗人马凡陀等集体写出了“欢呼胜利”，适夷等也马上创作了一首“让我们高歌”。年青的小弟弟们也不后人。华商报、文汇报的歌咏队热烈地展开了歌唱竞赛，他们唱出了“永远跟着中国共产党”，“我们的队伍来了”。几百十次满堂的掌声和欢呼，轰动了整个塘西区的居民。金陵大楼周围的马路上无数高楼的窗口，都站满被祝捷欢歌的热浪所激动了的人们，连金陵酒家的厨司和别楼的茶房都挤到了大楼的扶梯上来凑和热闹。虽然有香港政府重重的限制，不少人狂热地喊着“毛主席朱总司令万岁”和“中国共产党万岁”。大会直到深夜才在狂扭秧歌、狂唱歌曲、狂拍手掌、高喊“打到广州去”的欢声里散会。
    最欢狂的还是港九的十万进步劳工。直到六月初记者离开香港时，各大产业职业工会仍在不断地举办着庆祝中国人民大胜利的集会、聚餐、旅行。每天晚上，各工会都是歌颂胜利的歌声。电车、电灯、电话、船坞、海员、纱厂……三十几个单位组成了歌剧团。“五、一”节港九工会联合会的纪念大会的主要内容就是庆祝祖国工农兄弟的胜利。到会的有各工厂工友代表一千五百多人。会场占了金陵酒家的二层大楼，场里场外挤得水泄不通。庆祝大会，号召港九工人掀起爱国热潮，团结一致，为迎接新中国的诞生而奋斗。游艺节目中大英烟草公司女工们演出了歌颂新中国的大舞曲“民主中国已诞生”，海军船坞工人演出了表现中国人民英勇斗争的舞蹈“天快亮了”和五百多工人歌手的大合唱。大会从早上八时一直开到下午四时才散。
    港九青年们，对解放军的伟大的胜利，同样欢庆若狂。在这一段日子里，有五十多个歌咏团体分别在郊外大自然的海天中，狂热地庆祝着京沪的解放和向华南进军。
    解放军进入上海的消息在五月二十六日的清晨传到香港，这个消息使香港侨胞庆祝解放军胜利的欢狂，达到了顶点。工人、青年、学生、文化界和市民的疯狂庆祝，简直无法用文字和语言描述。
    无数在国民党匪帮迫害下流亡到香港的侨胞，都纷纷准备买舟重回自己新生的祖国。人行道上、轮渡里、茶座里处处是“侬几时回上海”的乡音。
    解放军进军江南后香港侨胞的欢腾，正可以看出无数万的侨胞对建设新中国的坚定信念，和对这个伟大的革命运动的领导者——毛主席、朱总司令和中国共产党的尊敬与爱戴。侨胞对自由祖国的殷切期望是历史上空前的。
