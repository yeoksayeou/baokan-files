　　Victory of Italian Agricultural Workers' Strike
    The two million agricultural workers of Italy, with unparalleled courage and solidarity, repelled the sabotage and persecution of the reactionary landlords and the government. After more than a month of persistent struggle, they have achieved a brilliant victory. A nationwide contract between agricultural workers and employers is about to be drafted, and landlords cannot arbitrarily dismiss workers. This victory of the strike will inspire the fighting will of the Italian working people and democratic forces. Vittorio, Secretary General of the Italian General Confederation of Labor, pointed out that it has a very positive significance, meaning that the democratic movement and trade union movement in Italy will develop and grow stronger in the future.
