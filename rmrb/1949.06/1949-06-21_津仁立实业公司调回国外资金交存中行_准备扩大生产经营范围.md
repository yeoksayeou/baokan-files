    [Tianjin News] To develop production and prosper the economy, the North China People's Government promulgated interim measures for foreign trade management and foreign exchange management in March and April. These measures stipulated that the supply and demand of foreign trade and foreign exchange would be controlled and adjusted by the Bank of China. It was also stipulated that remittances from overseas Chinese and other foreign exchange inflows could be exchanged for Renminbi at the official exchange rate, or the original currency could be deposited with the Bank of China to obtain a Class B foreign exchange deposit certificate. After recognizing the basic spirit of the government's measures, Tianjin Renli Industrial Company voluntarily deposited its foreign exchange of US$260,000 held overseas with the Bank of China and exchanged it for a Class B foreign exchange deposit certificate. The Bank of China stated to Renli Company that, according to the foreign exchange management measures, this Class B foreign exchange deposit certificate is not subject to the 40-day limit (foreign exchange obtained from export proceeds is issued as a Class A foreign exchange deposit certificate, which must be sold on the foreign exchange market within 40 days). All or part of the deposited foreign exchange can be exchanged for RMB at the official exchange rate at any time, or the deposited foreign exchange can be used to apply for self-provided foreign exchange to order imported goods from abroad. Renli Company stated when depositing these overseas funds: The company has a total of US$410,000 in overseas deposits. In the past, under the rule of the Kuomintang reactionary government, the domestic economy was in dire straits, and legitimate national industries could not develop. This deterred those willing to invest, so they had to transfer some funds to overseas deposits. After the liberation of Tianjin, the People's Government implemented correct economic policies, so it is willing to gradually transfer these funds held overseas back to the country in order to invest in production and expand undertakings beneficial to the national economy and the people's livelihood. It is also reported that the US$150,000 in securities held overseas is planned to be sold abroad as opportunities arise, and the resulting foreign exchange will be gradually deposited with the Bank of China for the purchase of machinery and increased production.

    津仁立实业公司调回国外资金交存中行  准备扩大生产经营范围
    【天津讯】华北人民政府为了发展生产繁荣经济，曾于三、四月间先后公布对外贸易管理和外汇管理暂行办法，规定对外贸易外汇之供需，由中国银行掌握与调剂。并规定华侨汇款和其他国外汇入之款项可按照牌价兑取人民券，或将原币交存中国银行，换开乙户外汇存票。津市仁立实业公司在认识政府这一办法的基本精神后，即将存于国外的外汇计美金二十六万元，自动交存中国银行，换开乙户外汇存单。中国银行向仁立公司声明：根据外汇管理办法，此项乙户外汇存单不受四十天期之限制（出口货款所得外汇，开给甲户外汇存单，限期四十天内在外汇交易所售出），可随时将所存外汇之一部或全部，按牌价兑取人民币，或将所存外汇申请自备外汇，向国外订购进口物品。仁立公司在交存这笔国外存款时表示：该公司国外共存有美金四十一万元，过去在国民党反动政府统治下，国内经济陷于绝境，正当的民族工业都无从发展，使愿意投资的也不敢投资，因此只好将一部资金转存国外。天津解放后，人民政府执行正确经济政策，故愿把此存放国外之资金陆续调回本国，以便投入生产，扩大有利于国计民生之事业。又悉：所存美金证券十五万元，拟见机在国外售出将所得外汇陆续交存中行，备作购买机器，增加生产之用。
