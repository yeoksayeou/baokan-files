Introducing the Opera "Wang Xiuluan"
    Mei Dezhan

    The play "Wang Xiuluan" portrays a labor hero. During the Japanese occupation, the Jizhong area suffered from brutal extortion and natural disasters leading to poor harvests and the people's hardship. The local anti-Japanese democratic government, on the one hand, persisted in the anti-Japanese guerrilla warfare, and on the other hand, led and organized the masses to vigorously produce, overcome natural disasters, and support the war of resistance. Many national heroes who defended the motherland and labor heroes who actively engaged in production emerged.

    In 1942, during the "May 1st" Japanese sweeping-up campaign, the "Three Alls Policy" (kill all, burn all, loot all) was implemented. The environment of indiscriminate killing, looting, and plunder was particularly cruel. Wang Xiuluan's mother-in-law was lazy and indulged in gambling all day long, unable to manage the household. The family frequently fought and quarreled, driving away her son Zhang Dachun and daughter-in-law Wang Xiuluan. The family scattered and could not continue her leisurely life, so she forcibly dragged her daughter Qiaoling to Zhangjiakou to find her husband Zhang Dianchen, hoping to live in humble security. Unexpectedly, they encountered the villain Niu Dashan's cunning deception, and the staunch Qiaoling was almost violated. Ultimately, she was forced to flee and coincidentally met her father on the way home. After being forced to leave home, Zhang Dachun joined the Eighth Route Army. Through study and combat, he became a hero in killing the enemy. Wang Xiuluan was lonely and unable to live. Under the leadership and assistance of the local democratic government, she cultivated the land herself and engaged in production, gaining a life of plenty. She also actively participated in anti-Japanese work and supported the front lines, earning the title of labor hero, clearly pointing out the practical content of women's struggle for equality in the new society.

    Labor can create happiness, and production is the foundation of prosperity. But in the old society, how many laborers and farmers toiled diligently their entire lives, only to end up with not a single room to live in or a piece of land to their name? Because the old society was an exploitative society that created poverty. The play "Wang Xiuluan" fully illustrates that as long as you are willing to work, even if you are like Wang Xiuluan with no firewood and no grain, under the leadership and assistance of the Communist Party, you can still become prosperous, with granaries full and overflowing, and attain a happy life.

    Labor creates all wealth. As the revolution is about to achieve victory throughout the country, compatriots who do not work or are not accustomed to laboring should rise up quickly, learn from the labor hero Wang Xiuluan, and respond to Chairman Mao's call to increase production by every inch!

　　介绍歌剧“王秀鸾”
    梅德善
    “王秀鸾”这个剧是表现一个劳动英雄，当日本鬼子统治时期，冀中地区受尽了残酷的勒索加之天灾歉收、民不聊生，当地的抗日民主政府一方面坚持抗日游击战争，一方面领导并组织群众大力生产，战胜天灾并支援了抗战，曾经涌现了许多保卫祖国的民族英雄，和积极生产的劳动英雄。
    一九四二年“五一”日本鬼子大扫荡实行“三光政策”，到处抢杀掠夺环境特别残酷，王秀鸾的婆婆好吃懒作，整天赌钱斗牌不能把家过日子，家里经常打架吵嘴。逼跑了儿子张大春，赶走了儿媳王秀鸾，一家人东奔西散，无法继续她的安闲日子，才硬拉着闺女巧玲到张家口去找丈夫张殿臣，心想苟且偷安，不料途中遭遇了坏蛋牛大山的巧计愚弄，坚贞不屈的巧玲险被糟踏了，最终被逼潜逃，中途巧遇其父一同归家。张大春被逼离家后当了八路军，经过学习、战斗，成了杀敌英雄。王秀鸾孤苦伶仃无法生活，经当地民主政府的领导和帮助，自耕自耘，从事生产，得到了丰衣足食的生活，还积极的参加了抗日工作、支援前线工作，荣获了劳动英雄的称号，明显地指出新社会的妇女争平等的实际内容。
    劳动能创造幸福，生产是发家致富的根本，但旧社会有多少劳动工人、农民埋头苦干，劳劳碌碌一辈子，临终还是捞了个房无一间地无一垄，因为旧社会是一个制造穷困的剥削社会。王秀鸾这一个剧充分的说明了：只要你肯劳动，你就是象王秀鸾那样柴无一根、米无一粒，在共产党领导下扶助下，同样也能发家致富，大囤满小囤流，得到幸福的生活。
    劳动创造一切财富，当此革命要在全国获得胜利的时候，不劳动与不习劳动的同胞们快起来，向劳动英雄王秀鸾看齐，响应毛主席的号召把生产提高一寸！
