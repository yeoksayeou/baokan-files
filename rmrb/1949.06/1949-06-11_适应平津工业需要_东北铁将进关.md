　　To Meet the Needs of Tianjin and Beijing Industries
  　Northeast Iron Will Enter the Pass
    [Reported by this newspaper] Northeast China is rich in iron, and the price is about 40% lower than that in Tianjin and Beijing. Even with transportation costs, it is still 20-30% lower than in Tianjin and Beijing. The state-owned Tianjin and Beijing Coal and Iron Company has purchased 500 tons of iron from the Anshan Iron and Steel Plant in Northeast China (mostly raw iron, a small amount of pig iron) and is starting to transport it to the Pass. It will arrive in Tianjin and Beijing within ten days for trial sales. At the same time, under the principle of promoting sales and benefiting both parties, it can be exchanged for finished products that meet the needs of rural areas. The Tianjin and Beijing Coal and Iron Company has now established offices in Shanhaiguan and Anshan. In the future, it will purchase iron in Northeast China in batches according to the needs of Tianjin and Beijing industries. (Zhong)

　　适应平津工业需要
  　东北铁将进关
    【本报讯】东北铁将可陆续运来平津。东北产铁丰富，价格比平津低约十分之四，即加上运输等费仍可较平津低十分之二、三。公营平津煤铁公司已在东北之鞍山铁厂购妥铁五百吨（大部为原铁，一小部生铁）正开始向关内运输，旬日内即可到达平津先行试销。同时在推销吸收两利原则下，可与合乎农村需要之成品进行交换。现平津煤铁公司已在山海关及鞍山等处设立办事处，今后将视平津工业需铁量，陆续在东北采购。　　　（仲）
