Xinhua News Agency, Beiping Broadcast: Shanghai, 17th. Shanghai's Bank of China's trial implementation of inflation-adjusted savings deposits has achieved initial success. Since the bank began offering inflation-adjusted savings on the 14th, workers and citizens in Shanghai have flocked to deposit savings. In three days, a total of 8,003 households deposited 158,315 shares, equivalent to 40,139,860 RMB.

Xinhua News Agency, Beiping Broadcast: Shanghai, 17th. The Shanghai Municipal Trade Corporation has recently discussed the issue of material exchange between Shanghai and various regions with representatives from trade corporations in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, Shandong, and other places. The Shanghai Municipal Trade Corporation will, based on production results, develop urban-rural material exchange in a planned manner to supply raw materials to Shanghai factories and daily necessities to Shanghai citizens.

Xinhua News Agency Correction
The 15th dispatch, page 195, in the article "Solidarity of Employees of Tianjin Public Enterprises," the second section states: "Some staff members also have doubts and dare not direct workers, leading to extreme democratization tendencies among some workers." This should be changed to "Some staff members also have doubts and dare not direct workers, while some workers have extreme democratization tendencies." In the same section, it also states: "But staff members must correct the erroneous views of belittling labor and belittling workers brought about by the old society, conduct self-criticism, and admit past mistakes to the workers." The phrase "certain staff members who have done things that have let the workers down should" should be added after the six words "conduct self-criticism."

    十五日电讯稿第一九五页天津公营企业职工团结一稿，其中第二节有：“也有一些职员则存有疑虑，不敢指挥工人，以致有些工人产生了极端民主化的偏向”一语，应改为“也有一些职员则存有疑虑，不敢指挥工人，而有些工人则存在极端民主化的偏向”。同节又有：“但职员必须改正过去旧社会带来的轻视劳动、轻视工人的错误观点，进行自我批评，向工人承认过去的错误。”一语，应在“进行自我批评”六字之下，加上“某些做过对不起工人的事的职员应”等十五字。
