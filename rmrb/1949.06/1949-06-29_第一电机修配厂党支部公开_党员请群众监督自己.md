　　First Electrical Machinery Repair Factory Party Branch Goes Public
　　Party Members Ask the Masses to Supervise Themselves
　　[Our Newspaper] The Communist Party branch of the First Electrical Machinery Repair Factory of the Military Commission's Telecommunications Directorate held a党员大会party member congress at 6 p.m. on the 27th, inviting non-Party employees to participate and announcing the Party organization publicly to the masses. The factory, including the warehouse, has more than 220 employees, of whom 47 are Party members. Before the Party went public, branch meetings and group meetings were held continuously to explain, mobilize, and conduct extensive discussions, making relatively sufficient preparations ideologically and eliminating various concerns of Party members. The meeting place was simple and solemn, and more than 70 non-Party employees participated. Liu Zude, the branch secretary, first announced to everyone: the Communist Party organization is made public today, so that the Party can be closer to the masses and unite the masses, and that Party members can be regularly supervised by the masses. Comrade Wang Jiagang, the representative of the general branch, then explained in detail the significance of making the Party public. He said: The Communist Party serves the masses, and all its propositions and activities are open and aboveboard, so there is no secret. In the past, because of the persecution of the Kuomintang, the Communist Party was forced to take underground activities; today, under the situation of national victory, the Party should be made public so as to further unite the masses and improve the factory. He explained: Party members have no special rights, only the right to serve the people wholeheartedly. Party members come from the old society, and it is possible that they have some shortcomings. He hoped that non-Party comrades would often offer opinions and criticisms when they see any shortcomings of Party members, so as to help Party members progress. He told Party members to humbly accept the opinions of the masses and improve themselves. Only with everyone's regular criticism and supervision can the Party become healthier. When the list of Communist Party members was announced, the audience applauded warmly continuously. During the free speeches, both Party members and non-Party members scrambled to speak. Party member Qi Zhen said: "Please non-Party comrades often give us criticisms to transform our shortcomings, and we will definitely accept them sincerely." Non-Party member Jiang Jiyuan also said very excitedly: "In the past, the Kuomintang said it was the people's 'servant', but in reality, they made decisions arbitrarily; today, I see the Communist Party members' sincere spirit of serving the people, which makes me very admire them. I have never liked to flatter people without principle, but seeing this great spirit makes me unable to help but express it." (Shang Kai)

  　党员请群众监督自己
    【本报讯】军委电信总局第一电机修配厂共产党支部，于二十七日下午六时召开党员大会，并请非党员职工参加，将党的组织在群众面前宣布公开。该厂连同仓库共有职工二百二十多人，其中有党员四十七名。在公开党之前，曾连续召开了支部会、小组会，进行解释动员与广泛的讨论，在思想上作了比较充分的准备，消除了党员的各种顾虑。会场布置朴素而严肃，非党员职工有七十余人参加。支部书记刘祖德首先向大家宣布：共产党的组织从今天公开，使党更能接近群众，团结群众，使党员能经常受到群众的监督。总支部代表王甲纲同志接着详细的说明公开党的意义，他说：共产党为群众服务，一切主张和活动都是光明正大的，因此没有什么秘密。在过去是因为国民党的迫害，共产党被迫采取地下活动；今天在全国胜利的形势下，应该将党公开，使能更进一步团结群众，将工厂搞好。他说明：党员没有特殊权利，只能全心全意为人民服务。党员是从旧社会里来的，身上有些缺点是可能的，希望非党同志看到党员有什么缺点时，经常提出意见与批评，帮助党员进步。他告诉党员要虚心接受群众的意见，改进自己。只有在大家经常批评与监督中，党才能更健全起来。在宣布共产党员名单时，全场不断地报以热烈的掌声。自由讲演时，党员与非党员均争先发言，党员戚镇说：“请非党同志经常向我们提出批评，改造我们的缺点，我们一定诚恳的接受。”非党员姜纪元也非常兴奋的说：“在过去，国民党说他是人民的‘公仆’，可是实际上什么事也由他们独断；今天我看到共产党员真诚为人民服务的精神，使我非常佩服。我向来不爱无原则的奉承人，可是我看到这种伟大的精神，使我不能不表示出来。”（商恺）
