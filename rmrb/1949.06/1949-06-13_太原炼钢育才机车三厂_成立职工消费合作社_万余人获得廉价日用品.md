　　Over 10,000 People Obtain Cheap Daily Necessities
　　[Taiyuan dispatch] Under the leadership of the Taiyuan Municipal People's Government Supply and Marketing Cooperative, worker consumer cooperatives have now been established in the Steel Refining, Yucai, and Locomotive factories in the city and have begun distributing daily necessities for the first half of June. The distribution quota is four days' worth of white flour for each worker member (two *jin* per person per day), eleven days' worth of millet and coarse grains (one *jin* of millet and one *jin* of coarse grains per person per day), two days' worth of white flour for family members, and thirteen days' worth of millet and coarse grains. Each member is allocated half a *jin* of oil and salt. For cloth, each garment is allocated eight *chi* of cloth (each member is allocated cloth for two sets of single-layer clothing and one set of cotton-padded clothing per year). The prices of various items are all lower than market prices. For example, the market price of millet (medium quality) is 42 yuan per *jin* (same below), while the cooperative price is 38 yuan; sorghum's market price is 34 yuan, and the cooperative price is 30 yuan; corn's market price is 36 yuan, and the cooperative price is 31.5 yuan; oil's market price is 140 yuan, and the cooperative price is 130 yuan.
