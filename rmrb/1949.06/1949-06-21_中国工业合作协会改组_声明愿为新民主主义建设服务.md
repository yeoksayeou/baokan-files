    Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 19th. The Chinese Industrial Cooperatives Association recently issued a statement here, denying the previous board of directors chaired by war criminal Kong Xiangxi. A temporary working committee was formed by Sha Qianli, Zhang Xichang, Qin Liufang, Chen Weiji, and 17 others, and a standing committee was elected from the working committee as the highest leading body during the transitional period. The statement expressed its willingness to serve the industrial construction of New Democracy under the leadership of the People's Government, and to unite with the local branches in the current liberated areas to extensively develop the production and cooperation cause to promote industrial construction. It is reported that the association was established in 1938 and had established more than 100 strongholds and more than 3,000 cooperatives across the country. However, due to the persecution of the Kuomintang reactionaries in recent years, only 14 strongholds and 316 cooperatives remain.

    中国工业合作协会改组
    声明愿为新民主主义建设服务
    【新华社上海十九日电】中国工业合作协会顷于此间发表声明，否认过去由战犯孔祥熙为理事长的理事会，另由沙千里、张锡昌、秦柳芳、陈维稷等十七人组成临时工作委员会，并由工作委员会产生常务委员会，作为过渡时期的最高领导机构。声明表示愿在人民政府领导之下，为新民主主义的工业建设服务，并准备和现在解放区的各地分会汇合，广泛地发展生产合作事业以推进工业建设。按该会成立于一九三八年，曾在全国各地建立了一百多个据点，三千多个合作社。但近年来由于国民党反动派的迫害，目前已仅剩十四个据点，三百十六个合作社。
