　　League Members Should Play a Leading Role in Learning
　　Comrade Xu Liqun's Call at the Ping City Middle School Communist Youth League Meeting
　　[This newspaper reported] The New Democratic Youth League members of all middle schools in Beiping gathered at the Taimiao yesterday (June 1st). Xu Liqun, director of the preparatory committee of the League in Beiping, reported on the issues of rectifying the order of study in middle schools, rectifying the temporary relief funds for middle schools, and further connecting the Communist Youth League members with the masses. Representatives from 75 schools, a total of 2,113 League members, attended. On rectifying the order of study, Comrade Liqun said: Currently, except for more than ten schools such as the Affiliated High School of China University, the order of most schools has been rectified under the efforts of the education authorities, teachers, and students. Communist Youth League members have played a significant leading and exemplary role, but some individual schools only pay attention to superficial forms and need to continue rectification. When talking about the issue of connecting with the masses, he pointed out that some League members participated in too many social activities (such as Yangko dancing, etc.) after liberation, which delayed their studies. Now that we have begun to build a new democratic country, Communist Youth League members must study hard and participate in construction work. Extracurricular activities can only be carried out on the principle of not hindering regular classes. He called on League members to play a leading role in learning, not only to excel individually, but also to help others learn and integrate with the masses. (Qing)

　　团员在学习中应起模范作用
  　许立群同志在平市各中学青年团员会上的号召
    【本报讯】北平全市中学校新民主主义青年团员昨天（六月一日）在太庙集会，由该团北平筹委会主任许立群报告关于中学整顿学习秩序，整顿中学临时救济金，及青年团员进一步联系群众诸问题。出席有七十五校，共团员二千一百十三人。在整顿学习秩序上，立群同志说：目前除中大附中等十余校以外，各校秩序在教育当局及师生努力下，大部都已整顿好。青年团员起了不少带头与模范作用，但还有个别学校只注意外表形式，还须继续整顿。谈到联系群众问题时，指出有些团员在解放后过多的参加社会活动（如扭秧歌等等），耽误了功课；现在已开始建设新民主主义国家，青年团员要好好学习；参加建设工作。课外活动只能在不妨碍正课的原则下进行。他号召团员们在学习上起模范作用，不仅个人要好，而且帮助别人学习，和群众打成一片。（清）
