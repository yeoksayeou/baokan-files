　　Farmers in Taiyuan Suburbs Actively Plant After Rain
    [Taiyuan Electricity] Farmers in the suburbs of Taiyuan are actively planting. After the previous rain, the People's Government, in order to solve the planting difficulties of poor farmers, provided some grain to those who had no means of production. Farmers in Da and Xiao Nanguan are rushing to cultivate and plant, some reclaiming wasteland and filling in the transportation trenches left by the enemy and puppet regimes. During the period of Yan's rule and exploitation, farmers regarded land as a pain and a burden. After the arrival of the People's Liberation Army, in addition to lending the vegetable garden land planted by Yan's Tenth Column to 30 farmers for cultivation, it also solved the difficulties in production, and the enthusiasm of the masses for production was unprecedentedly high. The village currently has more than 990 mu of arable land, and together with the wheat sown last year, 816 mu have been planted, and the rest can be sown after the next rain. In Xiaowang Village, District 6, in order to solve the problem of seed difficulties for farmers, a mass meeting was held on the evening of May 6 to mobilize mutual assistance and lending, "to ensure repayment in the autumn." This solved the planting difficulties of 35 households.

　　太原郊区农民雨后积极播种
    【太原电】太原郊区农民积极进行播种。前次雨后，人民政府为解决贫苦农民播种困难，凡生产无着的，均发给一些粮食。大、小南关农民赶耕赶种中，有的开荒和刨填敌伪留下之交通壕。在阎匪统治剥削时期，农民把土地看成痛苦和负担。解放军到达后，除将阎匪十纵队种的菜园地借给三十户农民耕种外，并解决生产中的困难，群众生产情绪空前提高。该村现有耕地九百九十余亩，连同去年播种之宿麦，已播种八百一十六亩，其余俟下雨后即可全部下种。六区小王村，为解决农民种籽困难，于五月六日晚召开群众大会，动员互助互借，“保证秋后归还”。这样解决了三十五户的播种困难。
