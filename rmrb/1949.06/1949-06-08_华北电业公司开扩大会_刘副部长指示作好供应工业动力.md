  　Vice Minister Liu Instructs to Ensure Industrial Power Supply
    [Our Newspaper] The North China Electric Power Company convened its first enlarged meeting yesterday (the 7th).

There were more than seventy attendees in total. Liu Ding, Deputy Minister of the North China Enterprise Department, gave an important report at the meeting. He said: "Electricity is the power of all industries. The quality of electrical work directly affects industrial development. Therefore, in the next year and a half, the first task is to get all existing machines running to cooperate with the industrial development of Beiping, Tianjin, Tangshan, and Zhangjiakou. The second task is to improve the supply and demand relationship of electricity and allocate usage time well, overcoming the existing disorganized state. We must never stick to conventions and must take various measures to help solve the electricity shortage in North China." He said: "We must serve the people wholeheartedly, without any commercial purpose, but we cannot let the state treasury lose money. This requires the efforts of all our employees to avoid waste and save money, to gradually reduce electricity prices. This is also the common requirement of all electricity users and should be our goal." Vice Minister Liu called on all employees to study hard, eliminate existing illiteracy and political blindness, and cultivate a large number of economic construction talents for the new democratic country. Finally, Vice Minister Liu emphasized that to complete the entire production task, it is necessary to implement democratic factory management, organize factory management committees, and streamline the bureaucratic institutions left over from the Kuomintang era. Dong Xin, Deputy Minister of the Youth Workers Department of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, happily wished the meeting success.
    Zhang Bin, representative of the North China Electric Power Company, proposed the production policy of preparing for future needs and increasing the existing power generation; and the operating policy of breaking even and reducing costs in his report.
    Bao Guobao, General Manager of the North China Electric Power Company, reported to the meeting on the organizational situation of the Electric Power Company and then explained that the central issues to be discussed and resolved at this meeting, based on the proposals previously submitted by the various branch offices, were the leadership relationship between the head office and the branch offices, the formulation of this year's and five-year production plans, and how to utilize existing machines to solve current needs, business regulations, and electricity prices. After the report, the four branch offices reported on the overview of the restoration and development of production and operation and management after liberation. The entire meeting is expected to last four days and close on the 10th.　　　　　(Bai Qing)
