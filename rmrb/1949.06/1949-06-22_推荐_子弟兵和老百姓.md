    Recommendation of "Soldiers and Civilians"
    Dong Qian
    The Anti-Enemy Drama Society of the Political Department of the North China Military Region recently performed the drama "Soldiers and Civilians" at Zhongshan Park (it is said they will perform it at the Literary and Art Congress soon). Whether in terms of its historical significance, its national educational significance, or its performance skills, its emotional impact is comparable to that of "The White Haired Girl."
    The drama is divided into three acts and five scenes. Its background is taken from a story in 1943 in Shilingzi, a village in the Jin-Cha-Ji Border Region, about the army and people working together to drive away the enemy. The story unfolds from the army and people working together to rush the harvest, to the discovery of spies spreading rumors, to the enemy looting Shilingzi and shooting civilians, until the army and people cooperate again to remove the stronghold, eliminate the enemy, avenge their hatred, and clear their grudges, at which point the story ends.
    Although the drama is about the War of Resistance Against Japan, its performance today, especially in newly liberated cities and towns, still has great practical educational significance. If we say that to know the present, we must understand the past, especially to understand who led and struggled arduously to achieve victory in the War of Resistance Against Japan, then we must understand how the Communist Party's Eighth Route Army united the masses and fought hard against the Japanese during the War of Resistance Against Japan, until the final victory was achieved; while the Kuomintang reactionaries, in order to get promoted and make a fortune, actually colluded with the Japanese invaders, became enemies of the people, delayed the victory of the War of Resistance Against Japan, and caused the Chinese nation a great humiliation. This page of history was erased and distorted by the Kuomintang reactionaries, and many people were deceived by it, but this drama can just explain this historical issue. Therefore, it is not only a typical portrayal of the relationship between the Eighth Route Army and the masses at that time, but also a vivid picture of how the Eighth Route Army grew from small to large, how it developed and strengthened itself in the struggle of uniting the masses, overcoming difficulties, and constantly resisting the enemy, using the enemy's weapons to arm itself. Today's millions of People's Liberation Army soldiers have grown and strengthened in the ten years of civil war and the eight years of the War of Resistance Against Japan. Their historical facts of being loyal to the country and the nation, loyal to the interests of the people, and sacrificing and struggling should indeed be written about in detail, widely publicized, understood by all the people, and never forgotten.
    If "The White Haired Girl" is a play reflecting the struggle between the peasant class and the landlord class; then "Soldiers and Civilians" is a play reflecting the Chinese People's Army and the people resisting Japanese imperialism together. Due to different historical conditions, struggle objects, and struggle nature, the themes expressed by the two have their own characteristics, that is, the former is mainly about class struggle, and the latter is mainly about national struggle. Therefore, a strong national consciousness, national hatred, and the idea of who is the real savior who saved the nation from peril run through the entire drama of "Soldiers and Civilians," and the education it gives to people is also the most profound. When the garrison and the masses of Shilingzi heard that "the Japanese devils are coming," the soldiers and militiamen went to meet them so bravely, and the people of the whole village implemented "clearing the fields" and moved into the mountains and forests. Especially in the second act, after the enemy looted Shilingzi, they forced a dozen old people to ask, "Where are the Eighth Route Army?" "Who is the Eighth Route Army?" "Where is the grain buried?" Even after severe torture, no one confessed. The high national integrity of the Chinese people was highly reflected in this life-and-death situation. Under normal circumstances, miracles that are difficult for ordinary people to achieve are common in the anti-Japanese base areas. For example, Grandpa Sanni, in order to destroy the supply, endured the pain and beat his granddaughter Sanni to death under the threat of the enemy's bayonet, and the dozen ordinary old people eventually died heroically together. Militia Captain Laifu severely rejected the enemy's hard coercion and softening, then crawled out of the bloody corpses, killed the enemy sentry, and returned to Shilingzi to go to the battlefield again. These typical examples of "wealth cannot corrupt, and power cannot subdue" are not "magical" in the anti-Japanese base areas under the leadership of the Communist Party. This drama is a vivid microcosm of the arduous struggle of the Eighth Route Army and the people in the eight years of the War of Resistance Against Japan. Because it truly and vividly reflects the historical reality, it naturally combines the expression of thoughts and emotions on the stage with the thoughts and emotions of the audience; when the scenes of the enemy and traitors looting Shilingzi appeared, almost all the audience shed tears of grief and anger, and some wept aloud. But when they attacked the enemy and won, captured the enemy chief captain and the traitor Liu Yuxi, the audience breathed a sigh of relief and was encouraged by the victory again. This also shows that only under the leadership of the Communist Party can all difficulties be overcome and the enemy finally defeated, and the enemy can certainly be defeated; the Kuomintang reactionaries are just the opposite, and the special agent and traitor Liu Yuxi is its embodiment, and the two form a sharp contrast. Therefore, "Soldiers and Civilians" has reached a fairly high level both politically and artistically, and is loved by the people. The fact that the audience did not disperse even after the play was over can explain it in general!
    But I think the drama still has a big shortcoming, that is, it does not add appropriate interweaving and foil to the performance of the various classes in the countryside during the War of Resistance Against Japan, but simplifies the complex countryside, and turns all the people in the countryside into peasants. It does not see the existence of the various classes, and it does not see the different attitudes of the representatives of the various classes - the progressive, the intermediate, and the stubborn. Therefore, it also fails to explain how the peasants treated the landlord class differently under the leadership of the Communist Party, and the specific process of how to win over and unite them; it also fails to explain how most of the landlords, under the cruel sweeping of the enemy, went from wavering and fear to being forced to take the road of resistance against Japan, and how a few elements lost their national self-confidence and went to the road of attaching themselves to the enemy and betraying the enemy. It is not clear what class the national agent Liu Yuxi belongs to, and even prominent figures such as the squad leader Laifu, Grandpa Sanni, and the village chief, why are they so firm and play a key role? It is difficult to find the answer from the class background. It seems that all the men, women, old and young in Shilingzi village are poured out of the same mold, they are all peasants, which is not completely in line with the historical reality, and it is also an important key to reducing its political value.
    Secondly, the issue of embodying the party's leadership is not about holding a cadre meeting of the regiment on the stage, because from the county to the village, the local party has its own set of leadership and anti-sweeping guiding organizations, but this is not clear here. It is necessary for the army to lead the militia in combat, but it seems to have replaced the party's leadership role in the war work in the countryside. For example, after the army withdrew, no cadres were sent to the countryside to arrange and lead the county and district, and it was not until after Shilingzi was looted that the district showed up to discuss and comfort the relief work, which was very insufficient.
    If the play can be further comprehensively considered and revised according to the spirit of our party's anti-Japanese national united front at that time, as well as the effect of the performance in the Ping opera, and overcome the one-sidedness in the play, it may become a historical drama depicting the army and the people working together to defeat the Japanese invaders.

### 推荐“子弟兵和老百姓”

    推荐“子弟兵和老百姓”
    董谦
    华北军区政治部抗敌剧社，前几天（闻近将在文代大会上出演）在中山公园公演话剧——“子弟兵和老百姓”，无论在它的历史意义上说，民族的教育意义上说，或演出的技巧上说，其感人之深，有相当于“白毛女”的效果。
    该剧分三幕五场，它的背景是取材于一九四三年晋察冀边区一个农村——石岭子军民合作赶走敌人的故事，故事的展开是从军民合作抢收，到发现特务造谣，敌人洗劫石岭子，枪杀老百姓，直到军民又合作拔去据点，消灭敌人，复了仇，雪了恨，故事就此结束。
    该剧虽写的抗战时期的故事，但它在今天特别是在新解放区城镇的演出，仍有很大的现实教育意义。如果说要知道现在就必须了解过去，特别是要了解抗战的胜利究竟是在谁领导和艰苦奋斗下获取的话，那就必须了解抗战时期共产党八路军是怎样团结群众艰苦抗战，直至取得最后的胜利；而国民党反动派则为了升官发财，竟然勾结日寇，与人民为敌，推迟了抗战的胜利，造成了中华民族的奇耻大辱。这一页历史，曾被国民党反动派所抹煞所歪曲，多少人也受其蒙蔽，而这一幕剧恰可以说明了这一历史问题。因此，它不啻是当时八路军与群众关系的典型的写照，而且是当时八路军如何由小到大，如何在团结群众克服困难和不断抗击敌人的战斗中，得到发展壮大，以敌人的武装武装了自己的一幅鲜明的图画，今天数百万人民解放军，就是在十年内战中和八年抗日战争中成长和壮大起来的。它们这种忠于国家民族、忠于人民利益和牺牲奋斗的历史事实，的确应大书特书，广为宣传，为全体人民所了解，永志不忘。
    如果说“白毛女”是一部反映农民阶级与地主阶级斗争的剧作；那么，“子弟兵和老百姓”则是一部反映中国人民军队和人民一起反抗日本帝国主义的剧作。由于历史条件、斗争对象、斗争性质不同，二者所表达的主题是各有其特征，即前者是以阶级斗争为主，后者是以民族斗争为主。因此，强烈的民族意识民族仇恨和谁是真正挽救民族危亡的救星，这一思想贯穿了“子弟兵和老百姓”的全剧，它给予人的教育也最深刻。当石岭子的驻军和群众，一听说“鬼子兵来时”，子弟兵和民兵是那样英勇的去迎击，老百姓则全村实行“空室清野”转入山林，特别是在第二幕里，敌人洗劫石岭子后，逼问着十几个老百姓“哪里有八路？”“谁是八路？”“粮食埋在哪里？”虽经严刑拷打，无一招供，中国人民的高度民族气节，在这生死决门的场合下高度地体现出来。在通常的情形下，为一般人很难做到的奇迹，但在抗日根据地却是数见不鲜，象三妮爷爷，为了灭供，在敌人的刺刀逼迫下，忍痛打死了自己的孙女三妮，而那十几位平凡的老百姓，最后也一起英勇殉难。民兵中队长来福严厉拒斥了敌人的硬逼软化后，又在血尸里爬出来，打死敌哨兵，回到石岭子再上战场。这些“富贵不能淫，威武不能屈。”的典型例子，在共产党领导下的抗日根据地并不“神奇”，这幕剧就是八路军与人民在抗战八年来艰苦奋战的一幅活生生的缩影。正因为它真实地生动地反映了历史现实，它就很自然地使舞台上思想情感的表达和观众的思想情感结合起来；当敌人、汉奸洗劫石岭子的几个场面出现时，全场观众几乎全为之流了悲愤之泪，有的哭泣成声。但当袭击敌人获胜、捉住敌酋大队长、汉奸刘玉喜时，观众这才松了口气，又为胜利所鼓舞起来。这就同时说明，只有在共产党的领导下，才能克服一切困难，最后打败敌人，而且一定能打败敌人；国民党反动派则恰相反，特务汉奸刘玉喜就是其化身，二者正形成一个鲜明的对照。所以，“子弟兵和老百姓”，无论在政治上艺术上都达到了相当高的水平，而为人民大众所喜闻乐见，就以戏演完而观众犹不走散这一事实，即可说明一般了！
    但我认为该剧还存在着一个很大的缺点，即对于农村各阶层在抗战中的表现，未加适当的穿插和衬托，而把复杂的农村简单化，把农村所有的人都农民化，看不出各阶级的存在，看不出各阶层代表人物不同的态度——进步的、中间的、顽固的。因之，也没能说明农民在共产党领导下对地主阶级的分别对待，以及如何争取、团结的具体过程；也没能说明地主在敌人残酷的扫荡下，大部分如何由动摇、恐惧，被迫走上抗战道路，少数分子则在丧失民族自信心下走向附敌投敌的汉奸道路。那个国特刘玉喜是什么阶级也未交代清楚，就连中队长来福、三妮他爷以及村长等突出的人物，究竟为什么那样坚定，和起了骨干作用？从阶级背景上也很难找到答案。好象石岭子全村男女老幼都是从一个模型倒出来的一样，都是农民，这是不完全符合历史现实的，也是减低其政治价值的一个重要关节。
    其次，即关于体现党的领导问题，并不在于台前开一个团的干部会议，因为，从县到村，地方党有地方党的一套领导和反扫荡的指导组织，但在这里并不鲜明，军队领导民兵作战是必要的，但似乎有些代替了党在农村对战争工作的领导作用。如军队撤走了后，县区即无干部下乡布置与领导，只在石岭子被洗劫后，才显露了下区上讨论安抚救济工作，这是很不够的。
    该剧如再能根据我党当时抗日民族统一战线的精神，以及在平演出的效果，加以全面的考虑与修改，克服剧中的片面性，则可能成为一部描写军民合作战胜日寇的具有历史意义的剧作。
