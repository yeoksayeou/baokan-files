Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 9th: Reports from various sources indicate that the Canadian maritime workers' strike, which began on March 31st, is persisting and expanding despite various forms of persecution. On June 7th, seamen from five Canadian ships docked in British ports demonstrated in front of the American Embassy and Naval Headquarters, protesting the policy of the American Federation of Labor's reactionary leaders to interfere in Canadian trade unions. Because British dockworkers supported the Canadian sailors' strike, the AFL threatened to boycott British merchant ships. The reactionary leaders of the AFL also supported strikebreakers sent by Canada to Cuba to undermine the Canadian sailors' strike. In response, the General Secretary of the Cuban Workers' Confederation sent a telegram to AFL President Green, protesting this behavior. He stated that Cuban workers' refusal to unload Canadian cargo ships is precisely an expression of solidarity with Canadian sailors. Currently, the Canadian sailors' strike has not only not been halted by the strikebreakers but has also spread to South Africa and Australia. The reactionary leadership of the Canadian Trades and Labour Congress decided on the 3rd to suspend the membership of the Seafarers' International Union, attempting to force workers affiliated with the union to return to work, but this has not been effective. The "Canadian Compass" arrived in Liverpool on the 3rd, and because British dockworkers in that port refused to unload cargo in support of the Canadian sailors' strike, the ship was forced to return to its own country.

　　加海员罢工扩大
  　英国古巴工人积极支援
    【新华社北平九日电】各方报道：三月三十一日开始的加拿大海员工人罢工，虽遭各种迫害，仍在坚持及扩大中。停泊英国港口的五艘加拿大轮船的海员们，本月七日在美国大使馆及海军司令部大厦前示威，反对美国劳工联合会反动领袖干涉加拿大工会的政策。因为英国码头工人声援加拿大海员罢工，劳联曾恐吓说要抵制英国商船。劳联反动领袖，并支持由加拿大派赴古巴破坏加拿大海员罢工的工贼。古巴工人联合会总书记为此已致电劳联主席格林，抗议此种行为。他说，古巴工人拒绝为加拿大货船卸货，正是与加海员团结的表示。目前，加拿大海员的罢工，不但未因工贼的破坏而停顿，且已扩及南非及澳大利亚。加拿大职工大会的反动领导机关，三日决定停止海员工会的会籍，企图压迫该会所属工人复工，但，并未生效。“加拿大罗盘”号三日抵达利物浦，因该港英国码头工人为支援加海员罢工，拒绝卸货，该轮已被迫驶回本国。
