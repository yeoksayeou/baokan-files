    The film industry in the liberated areas, like other people's undertakings, has been developing rapidly in recent years. In the autumn of 1938, the General Political Department of the Eighth Route Army established a film troupe with only a dozen people, including a photography team and a projection team. However, in the past two or three years, thanks to the great victory of the People's Liberation War, the liberated areas now have two film studios. One is the Northeast Film Studio, which has been around for three years, with Yuan Muzhi as the director and Wu Yinxian and Zhang Xinshi as deputy directors. The other is the Beiping Film Studio, which was established only two months ago, with Tian Fang as the director and Wang Yang as the deputy director. The two studios have a total of more than 1,350 staff members. In addition, the Shanghai Film Studio will soon be established. In order to meet the needs of the new film industry, the Central Film Bureau was officially established in May this year, and it will be responsible for the unified leadership of this new people's cultural undertaking.
    The film industry in the liberated areas has been serving the people from the very beginning. The first film was "Yan'an and the Eighth Route Army" produced in 1939. Later, it successively produced documentaries such as "The First Yan'an Assembly," "October Revolution Day," "Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region Industrial Exhibition," and "Nanniwan." At that time, due to the lack of modern facilities, gramophones were used for dubbing and amplifiers for explanation. However, these newsreels are great; they are the Chinese people's own films, and they represented workers, peasants, and soldiers on film for the first time.
    The liberated areas were able to produce films on a relatively large scale starting in May 1947. In the past two years, a total of twelve films have been produced. Among them, eleven are news documentaries such as "Democratic Northeast," and one is the famous artistic film "The Bridge." These twelve films have been screened more than 12,000 times in Northeast China alone, with an audience of more than 7.6 million people. News documentaries currently being produced and edited include "Three Years in the Northeast," as well as the liberation of cities such as Taiyuan, Nanjing, Xi'an, and Wuhan, as well as the situation of sericulture, fishery, the Military and Political University, state-owned mechanical farms, and the youth massacred by Kuomintang agents in Changchun. There are four artistic films currently in production: "Father and Son Return Together," which aims to disintegrate the enemy army; "Boundless Radiance," which focuses on workers in Harbin repairing generators; "White-Clad Warriors," which focuses on the deeds of Li Landing, a model medical worker in East China; and "Women's Lives," which depicts rural women participating in sideline production. In addition, seven artistic films are in preparation. The scripts for "War Without Frontlines" and "Eight Women Throw Themselves into the River" have been completed and will be filmed soon. "War Without Frontlines" depicts revolutionary security work; "Eight Women Throw Themselves into the River" tells the story of the heroic sacrifice of "eight guerrillas of the Northeast Anti-Japanese Democratic United Army." The scripts for "Zhao Yiman" and "Scenery of the Northern Frontier" have just been initially written and are being revised. ("Zhao Yiman" depicts the heroic deeds of Zhao Yiman, a female hero and one of the leaders of the Northeast Anti-Japanese Democratic United Army; "Scenery of the Northern Frontier" depicts the lives of the people of Inner Mongolia.) As for famous operas and dramas such as "The White Haired Girl," "Song of the Red Flag," and "March of the Democratic Youth," the Northeast Film Studio is also planning to adapt them into films. It is expected that, in addition to "The Bridge," seven artistic films may be released to the audience this year.
    More than a thousand film workers in the liberated areas hate using Hollywood-style low-level tastes and pornography to poison and anesthetize the audience, and they also oppose using boring gimmicks to please and cater to backward audiences. They demand that film's unique form be used to profoundly reflect and guide reality, to move and educate the audience, and to serve the cause of the liberation of the new China. Therefore, a large number of film workers, like other literary and art workers, have gone to the countryside, to the army, and to the factories in batches to experience life, to collect materials, and to enrich the content and expression methods of the new people's films. In order to produce the artistic film "The Bridge," fifty or sixty film workers went into the Harbin Railway Factory to learn steelmaking, bridge repair, and other technologies. In order to produce "White-Clad Warriors," more than forty film workers went into the Shandong Military Region Hospital, where they worked with doctors and nurses to change dressings, wash blood and squeeze pus, deliver meals, and empty bedpans for the wounded. In order to record the glorious achievements of the People's Liberation Army, a total of fifty-nine film workers went deep into the companies, lived and fought alongside the soldiers of the People's Liberation Army. Last September, when the People's Liberation Army broke through the city walls of Jinzhou, a vanguard company that had penetrated deep into the enemy's heart was blocked by the enemy's firepower. A platoon leader who was rushing to the front was shot in the shoulder, and his submachine gun fell to the ground. At this moment, a photographer rushed forward, holding up his camera. He shouted loudly: "Comrades, charge! I'm filming you!" The wounded platoon leader grabbed his submachine gun again, and more soldiers charged up the Jinzhou city wall in one go. This photographer was the Communist Party member Wang Jingan. After the Jinzhou Campaign, Wang Jingan set out with the army again and produced a documentary of the Liaoxi Campaign. Finally, he gloriously sacrificed himself in the battle to liberate Shenyang. Yang Yinxuan and Zhang Shaoke, two photographers who also gloriously sacrificed themselves during the final battle in the Northeast, were also Communist Party members. They exchanged their lives for the historical record of the total annihilation of the bandit army and the liberation of the entire Northeast. The film workers of the new China are developing and strengthening their cause with such spirit.

    解放区的电影事业
    刘衡
    解放区的电影事业，和其他的人民事业一样，这几年来，有着飞快的发展。一九三八年秋天，八路军总政治部曾经设立了一个电影团，一共只有十几个人，包括一个摄影队和一个放映队。可是，两三年来，由于人民解放战争的伟大胜利，现在解放区已经有了两个电影制片厂。一个是东北电影制片厂，有三年的历史，厂长是袁牧之，副厂长是吴印咸和张新实。另一个是北平电影制片厂，成立才两个月光景。厂长是田方，副厂长是汪洋。两个厂一共一千三百五十多个工作人员。此外，上海电影制片厂不久将成立。为了适应新的电影事业的需要，今年五月，正式成立了中央电影管理局，今后将由它来统一领导这一个新的人民文化事业。
    解放区的电影事业，一开始就是为人民服务的。第一部影片是一九三九年摄制的“延安与八路军”，以后又接连摄制了“延安第一届参议会”，“十月革命节”，“陕甘宁边区工业展览会”和“南泥湾”等记录片。当时因为没有现代化的条件，用留声机来配音，用扩大器来说明。可是这些新闻片是伟大的，它是中国人民自己的影片，它第一次地用电影表现了工农兵。
    解放区的电影能够比较大量的摄制，是从一九四七年五月开始的。两年来已经摄制好了的电影片一共有十二部。其中有十一部是“民主东北”等新闻记录片，一部是有名的艺术片“桥”。这十二部片子，光是在东北，就放映了一万二千多次，观众在七百六十多万人以上。现在正在摄制和剪接中的新闻记录片，有“东北三年”，有太原、南京、西安、武汉等城市解放的情形，还有蚕业、渔业、军政大学情况、公营机械农场、长春市被国民党特务残杀的青年等等。正在摄制的艺术片一共是四部：有瓦解敌军的“父子同归”，有以哈尔滨工人修复发电机为主题的“光芒万丈”，有以华东模范医务工作者李兰丁的事迹为主题的“白衣战士”，有描写农村妇女参加副业生产的“妇女生活”。此外，还有七部艺术片正在准备摄制之中。象“没有战线的战争”和“八女投江”，脚本已经写好了，很快就可以开拍。“没有战线的战争”的主题是描写革命的保卫工作；“八女投江”演的是东北抗日民主联军的“八个游击队员英勇牺牲的情形。”“赵一曼”和“塞北风光”的脚本才初步写好，正在修改之中。（“赵一曼”演的是东北抗日民主联军领导人之一女英雄赵一曼的英勇事迹，“塞北风光”演的是内蒙古人民生活的情形）。至于“白毛女”、“红旗歌”、“民主青年进行曲”等有名的歌剧和话剧，东北电影制片厂也在计划加以改编，把它们拍成电影。预计今年除“桥”之外，还有七部艺术片可能和观众见面。
    解放区一千多电影工作者，痛恨以好莱坞式的低级趣味和诲淫诲盗来毒害和麻醉观众，也反对以卖弄无聊的噱头来讨好和迎合落后观众，他们要求以电影特有的形式来深刻反映和指导现实，来感动和教育观众，来为新中国的解放事业服务，因此大批的电影工作者，和其他文艺工作者一样，先先后后一批批的到农村去、到部队去、到工厂去体验生活，去搜集材料，来丰富新的人民电影的内容和表现方法。为了摄制艺术片“桥”，五、六十个电影工作者走进了哈尔滨铁路工厂，学习炼钢、修桥等技术。为了摄制“白衣战士”，四十多个电影工作者就走进山东军区医院，他们跟医生、护士一块，替伤员换药包扎、洗血挤脓、送饭、倒尿盆。为了要记录下人民解放军的光辉战绩，前后一共有五十九个电影工作者深入连队，在人民解放军的队伍里，和战士们一同生活，一同作战。去年九月，人民解放军在突破锦州城垣的时候，某个深入敌军腹心阵地的尖刀连被敌人的火网阻住了，冲在最前面的一个排长肩膀被打伤，冲锋枪掉在地下。就在这时候，一个摄影师高举着摄影机，冲上前去。他大声的喊：“同志们，冲啊！我给你们拍电影！”受了伤的排长又抓起了自己的冲锋枪，更多的战士一股劲地冲上了锦州城头。这个摄影师，就是共产党员王静安。王静安在锦州战役之后，又随军出发，摄制了辽西战役记录片。最后，终于在解放沈阳的战役中，光荣牺牲，在东北的最后决战中，跟王静安同志同时光荣牺牲的摄影师还有杨荫萱、张绍柯、都是共产党员。他们以自己的生命换取了匪军全部覆没、东北全境解放的历史的记录。新中国的电影工作者，就是以这样的精神，来发展和壮大自己的事业。
