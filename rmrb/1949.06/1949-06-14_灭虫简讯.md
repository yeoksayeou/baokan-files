　　Pest Control Briefs
　　In Zhao Baihu Camp and Yang Zhuangzi, and fourteen other villages in the eighth district of Luan County, Eastern Hebei, locusts were causing damage. County and district cadres immediately went to the countryside to widely mobilize the masses to eliminate the locusts. In four days, the fourteen villages in the district eliminated 10,496 jin of locusts, and 80% of the locusts have been exterminated. In Qian'an's sixth district, a locust eradication command was established, mobilizing the masses in thirty-eight villages to jointly eliminate locust nymphs. In the fifteen villages with the most severe insect infestations, the pest damage has now been basically eliminated in 18,350 mu of land. After a pest outbreak in Changli, the county party committee immediately issued instructions for pest control. With the active efforts of the masses, the pests have now been mostly eliminated.
　　Taiyue: More than 100 mu of barren fields north of Zhulong River and south of Xiaozhuang in the third district of Jiyuan, were destroyed by water, and locusts were discovered on the 20th of last month. The district head of the third district immediately went to the locust-infested area to inspect and sent personnel to organize the masses locally. Now, 1,115 people, including women, children, and the elderly, from seven villages, including Zhong Matou and Xi Zheng, have surrounded the locusts and are using wheat straw to burn and eliminate them.
　　Central Hebei: In the fourth district of Wen'an, mole crickets were found to be damaging spring seedlings, preventing them from emerging fully. Seedlings that had emerged were being damaged by mole crickets, and the roots of many yams were being bitten off, preventing them from emerging at all. The district government has now formulated specific measures to mobilize the masses to buy arsenic and sprinkle it on the roots. Land that has not been sown should be plowed once before sowing, and then rolled twice after planting. Mixing thallium with the seeds during planting can prevent mole crickets from damaging the seedlings.
　　Taihang: In the sixth district of Huojia, Northern Henan, a serious insect infestation occurred along both banks of the grain transport river. The insects were one inch long, with two colors, black and gray, and they specialized in eating the roots and stems of crops. The district leaders immediately organized a district-wide pest control command, with cadres assigned specific tasks and a five-day plan and method for pest control drawn up. This was completed after three days of concentrated effort. The work of replanting and wheat harvesting is now being carried out intensively.
　　Chahar Province: Pests occurred in Xingtang and other places last month. Locust nymphs occurred in the Beiqiao Village area of Xingtang, covering an area of six to seven li, with a density of six to seven per square foot in dense areas. Fireworms appeared on wheat in the fourth and fifth districts of Jingxing. Fireworms also occurred in Huolu County, spreading from the sixth district to the entire county. "Wireworms" were found on wheat in the western suburbs of Zhuolu, living more than a foot deep underground and specializing in biting wheat roots. Each county immediately organized forces to actively fight the pests, and many have been eliminated.
