　　"For Our Children!"
    As the Foreign Ministers' Conference encountered difficulties in reaching an agreement on the peaceful reunification of Germany due to the continued plot by the United States, Britain, and France to divide Germany, the resounding call of the World Peace Congress—to defend peace and expose the instigators of new wars—continued to surge, strengthen, and expand throughout the world. The Executive Bureau of the World Federation of Democratic Youth called on youth around the world to resolutely support and implement the resolutions of the Peace Congress. The French Women's Federation Congress prominently put forward powerful resolutions to defend peace; the signature campaign to defend peace initiated by the Swedish Women's Federation has already garnered responses from over 50,000 women, calling on mothers to unite as one "for our children," to oppose atomic weapons, and to oppose new wars! Polish female workers wrote to American women, urging them to emulate the mothers in the Soviet Union and the new democracies of Eastern Europe who are striving for peace, and to work together to thwart all imperialist war conspiracies! The powerful camp of the world defending peace and democracy will surely defeat all the conspiracies and tricks of the warmongers!
