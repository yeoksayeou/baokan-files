The rainy season is approaching, and the flood season is imminent. Most of the flood control projects in Chahar Province have been completed, and the remaining work is being actively rushed. In the upper reaches of various rivers in Chahar Province, flash floods have eroded a lot of land every year. Therefore, flood control work is of a general nature in various parts of the province. As early as November last year, the Chahar Provincial People's Government instructed special and county officials to cooperate with local experts to conduct surveys and measurements in villages along the Shahe River, Hutuo River, Ci River, etc., and assist local areas in making specific flood control plans and preparing materials. In particular, the flood control project in Jianping Special Zone is relatively large. The North China People's Government allocated 170,000 catties of millet for river management this spring to solve the problem of material shortages. On the basis of the preparatory work last year, many areas began construction immediately after the thaw. As of now, according to incomplete statistics, 60 embankments have been built in 12 counties in the Jianping, Yishui, and Yanbei special zones. 50 villages and 120,000 mu of land that may be eroded have been safely protected. Among them, the larger project is the Shahe River embankment in Xingtang, which was fully completed before May 15 this year. The Hutuo River along Zhengding relates to the safety of 20 villages, and the protection project upstream of the Wukong Bridge has been completed. According to last year's experience, Lishan, Hongzidian, Xiaomi峪 and other three villages in Jianping County also prepared for flood prevention early, and completed three large embankments successively in February and April. Furthermore, the protection project in Hunyuan County, Yanbei, has now been strengthened to a certain degree of consolidation. During the big flood in the 28th year of the Republic of China (during the enemy occupation), the river channel breached, and more than 4,000 people in the county were washed away. After liberation, under the leadership of the Communist Party and the People's Government, active protection was launched. Last year, the government allocated 100 shi of subsidized rice, and this year it continued to allocate 37 shi to repair an 8-mile-long embankment near the county seat, and added more than 20 land protection dams. Xushui County has dug three drainage ditches with a total length of 40 li, and the 96,900 mu of low-lying farmland in the county can avoid the danger of flooding. The second largest project is the Songyang River in Lingshou Chengguan, the lower reaches of the Wukong Bridge on the Zhengding Hutuo River, and the Chennanzhuang and Shihou on the Yanzhi River in Fuping, which are still being rushed. The Renzi Dam in Huaian, Chahar South, the Gongyi Dam in Zhuolu, and the flood control dam in Xuanhua are also preparing for construction.

		Flood Discharge Channels for Flood Control and Fertile Fields Deserve Promotion

This year, Chahar South has also built 93 flood discharge channels (ie, silt discharge channels). It is estimated that during the flood season, more than 50,000 mu of land in the county can be completely silted with water. If the channels for both clear water and floodwater are included, the silt irrigation area will be over 100,000 mu. This silt discharge channel can disperse the force of the water, reduce the mud content and flood volume, which is not only conducive to flood control and bank protection in downstream villages, but also greatly improves the soil and increases production. In essence, this is related to the fundamental issue of river management and deserves promotion. The water conservancy engineering team of Chahar Province has set off for the Yuhe River and Sanggan River in Datong and Yangyuan to survey and measure silt discharge channels in preparation for construction after autumn. Chahar South and Yanbei will also build a large number of silt discharge channels.

		Unified Leadership and Sound Organization are the Key to Flood Control

According to past experience and lessons, areas with unified leadership, sound organization, and conscientious protection can turn harm into benefit. Tang County did a better job last year. The county organized the Tang River Committee to uniformly lead the relevant districts and villages to promptly repair and rush to protect. Therefore, not only were the villages along the coast not hit by floods, but 90% of the beach land was silted, with two to three inches of mud deposited. The Shahe River embankment in Xingtang had three breaches last year due to lack of unified leadership and unsound organization. The water washed away sand and submerged crops in more than 20 hectares, and many trees on the bank were also washed down. This year has seen great improvement.

This year's flood control work in Chahar Province has first focused on unified leadership, and made early preparations for surveying, measuring, preparing materials, carefully planning, and extensively using local experts with river management experience, educating and reversing the masses' mentality of taking chances. Because of these measures, such great achievements have been achieved. During the implementation, some areas also experienced deviations. For example, the special and county-level leaders in Jianping Special Zone initially underestimated the strength of the masses and excessively demanded and relied on the government to issue river management funds. After correction, the government only issued 170,000 catties of millet for river management, and most of the remaining expenses were solved by the local people themselves. In other areas, flood control work was not regarded as equally important and inseparable from farmland water conservancy, and the construction was out of touch with the engineering plan. For example, Lingshou County did not implement the plan approved by the provincial government, and the construction project was very sloppy. This irresponsible, disorganized, and undisciplined approach deserves a profound review by the county leaders.

　　察省及早准备防洪堤坝工程大部完成
    【本报讯】雨季将临，伏汛即来，察省各地防洪工程已大部完成，余工正积极赶修中。察省各河上游，历年山洪暴发，都冲刷不少土地，因此防洪工作在该省各地带有普遍性质。察哈尔省人民政府早在去年十一月间，即指示各专、县派干部协同当地专家，前往沙河、滹沱河、慈河等沿岸村庄，进行勘察测量。并协助当地作出具体防洪计划与准备工料。特别是建屏专区，防洪工程较大，华北人民政府本年春，特拨发十七万斤小米的治河费，以解决工料困难。在去年准备工作的基础上，不少地区在解冻后，即开始了工程建设。截至目前，据不完整统计：建屏、易水、雁北三个专区十二个县份，已兴修堤坝六十余处，可能被冲刷的五十个村庄与十二万亩土地，已安保无虞。其中较大工程是行唐的沙河大堤，于今年五月十五日前，已全部完工。正定滹沱河沿岸，关系到二十个村庄的安危，目前五空桥上游的防护工程已竣工。建屏县的黎山、洪子店、小米峪等三个村亦根据去年经验，早防水患，于二、四两月，先后完成了三座大堤。再是雁北浑源县的防护工程，现已加修到一定的巩固程度。按民国二十八年间发大水（敌占时期）河道决口，该县曾被冲走四千余人。解放后，在共产党与人民政府的领导下，积极展开防护，去年政府曾拨补助米一百石，今年又续拨了三十七石，补修了县城附近八里长的大堤一座，另加修到二十多个护地坝。徐水县已挖了总长四十里地的三道泄水沟，该县九万六千九百亩的洼地庄稼，可免淹涝危险。其次较大工程，有灵寿城关的松杨河，正定滹沱河五空桥的下游及阜平胭脂河畔的陈南庄，石猴等四处，尚在赶修中。察南怀安的人字坝、涿鹿的公益坝、宣化的防洪坝，亦正在准备施工。
    　　　　放淤渠防洪肥田　有提倡必要
    察南于今年更兴修了九十三道洪水渠（即放淤渠），预计在洪汛期间，该县有五万多亩土地，可全部使水淤泥。如连清洪水两用的渠道合计在内，其淤灌面积，当在十万亩以上。此项放淤渠，可以分杀水势，减少含泥量与洪水量，不但有利于下游村庄的防洪护岸，且可大大改善土壤，提高生产量。实质上，这关系到治河治本问题，有提倡的必要。察省的水利工程队，日前出发大同，阳原的御河、桑乾河，勘察测量放淤渠，准备秋后开工。察南、雁北亦将大量开造放淤渠。
    　　　　统一领导健全组织是防洪工作的关键
    根据以往的经验教训，即凡领导上统一，组织健全，认真防护的地区，可化害为益。去年唐县作的较好，该县曾组织了唐河委员会，统一领导有关区村及时补修及时抢护，故沿岸村庄不仅未遭水患，而且百分之九十的滩地都得到放淤，上泥各二三寸不等。行唐沙河大堤，由于领导上不统一，组织工作不健全，去年堤身决口三处，水冲沙压，涝坏庄稼达二十余顷，岸边树林亦冲倒不少。今年则已大有改进。
    察省今年的防洪工作，首先注意了统一领导，并及早作了准备勘察测量工程，准备工料，精心计划，广泛的运用了当地有治河经验的专家，教育并扭转了群众的侥幸心理，由于这些措施，才获得了如上巨大的成绩。执行当中，部分地区，亦曾发生偏向，如建屏专区的专、县级领导上，开始对群众力量认识不足，过高要求与依赖公家发放治河费，经过纠正后，公家只发十七万斤小米的治河费，其余大部费用由当地群众自行解决。还有的地区，没有把防洪工作与农田水利看成同等重要与不可分离，施工与工程计划脱节，如灵寿县未按省府批准之计划执行，施工工程很草率，这种对人民不负责的无组织无纪律的做法，值得该县领导上深刻检讨。
