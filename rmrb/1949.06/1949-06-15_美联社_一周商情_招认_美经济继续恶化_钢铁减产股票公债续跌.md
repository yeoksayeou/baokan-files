　　AP "Weekly Business Report" Admits
  　U.S. Economy Continues to Deteriorate
  　Steel Production Cuts, Stocks and Bonds Continue to Fall
    Xinhua News Agency, Peiping, June 14th: According to the Associated Press's "Weekly Business Report" for the week ending June 11th, the U.S. economic situation is continuing to deteriorate. The "Weekly Business Report" points out that the U.S. economic situation for the week is as follows: industrial production continues to decline, commodity prices are falling, retail and wholesale trade are sluggish, unemployment is increasing rapidly, the total number of unemployed has exceeded seasonal forecasts, stocks and bonds are falling, and labor problems are tense.

    Of particular note is steel production, which cannot avoid continuing to decline even amidst a large-scale military expansion. The "Weekly Business Report" states: "On the losing side of this week’s production table is the decline in steel production. Steel mills' productivity utilized 91.8 percent the previous week, but this week it has fallen to 89.1 percent, which is even further behind compared to the 96.1 percent in the same week last year. This is the eighth consecutive week that steel production has declined." As for the stock market, the "Weekly Business Report" points out: "It is always retreating, and its average price has reached the lowest point since May 1947, reducing the listed price of registered stocks by ten billion dollars." According to a Wall Street broker quoted by the Associated Press in a letter to his clients, when discussing the stock market decline, he expressed deep concern about the bleak prospects of the U.S. economy, saying: "In fact, there is ample reason to believe that the current prices are sufficient to make people predict the most unfavorable situation that may occur in the business world, and it is not surprising."

　　美联社“一周商情”招认
  　美经济继续恶化
  　钢铁减产股票公债续跌
    【新华社北平十四日电】据美联社发表截至十一日为止的“一周商情”，透露了美国经济情况正在继续恶化中。“一周商情”，指出该周美国的经济情况为：工业生产继续下降，商品跌价，零售与批发贸易不振，失业人数急剧增加，失业总数已超过了季节性预测的水平，股票与公债跌价，劳工问题紧张。
    其中最值得注意的是钢铁生产，即使在大量扩军中也避免不了继续下降。“一周商情”称：“在本周生产表的一边，出现了钢铁生产的下降。钢铁工厂的生产力前周运用了百分之九十一点八，本周已跌至百分之八十九点一，比去年同周的百分之九十六点一，就更瞠乎其后了。这是钢铁生产一直下降的第八周。”至以股票市场，“一周商情”指出：“总是在向后退缩，其平均价格已达到一九四七年五月以来的最低点，使已经登记的股票的牌价减少了十亿美元。”据美联社所引华尔街某经纪人在给他的顾客的一封信中，在谈到股票下跌的问题时，表示了对美国经济前途暗淡的殷忧，他说：“其实，有着充分的理由可以认为，现在的价格足够使人预测企业界可能发生最不利的局面，而不足为奇。”
