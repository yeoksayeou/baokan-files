    and the Number of Representatives; Also Elects the Standing Committee of the Preparatory Committee.
    The Plenary Session Fully Demonstrates an Atmosphere of Harmony and Unity and a Spirit of Seeking Truth from Facts.
    [Xinhua News Agency, Beiping, 19th] The Preparatory Committee for the New Political Consultative Conference was established in Beiping on the 15th of this month. The first plenary session, lasting five days, concluded successfully at 6:30 PM today and was declared closed. The conference unanimously passed the "Organizational Regulations of the Preparatory Committee for the New Political Consultative Conference" (see separate dispatch) and the list of 45 units and their 510 representatives participating in the New Political Consultative Conference (to be published tomorrow), and elected Mao Zedong, Zhu De, Li Jishen, and 18 others (list see separate dispatch) to form the Standing Committee, responsible for carrying out daily affairs. The Standing Committee nominated Mao Zedong as Chairman, and Zhou Enlai, Li Jishen, Shen Junru, Guo Moruo, and Chen Shutong as Vice Chairmen.
    Those participating in this preparatory committee include: the original proposer of the New Political Consultative Conference, the Chinese Communist Party, and 22 other units, totaling 134 people (list see separate dispatch), consisting of various democratic parties, people's organizations, democratic figures from all walks of life, representatives of domestic minority nationalities, and overseas Chinese representatives who support the CCP's proposal.
    The proposal to convene the New Political Consultative Conference to establish a democratic coalition government was put forward by the Chinese Communist Party in the "May 1st" slogan of 1948. The CCP's proposal received a rapid and widespread response from the national democratic camp. Representatives of various democratic parties and democratic strata began to arrive in the liberated areas in August of last year to jointly prepare for the New Political Consultative Conference with the CCP. CCP leaders exchanged views with them in detail on various national issues. In the discussions lasting approximately ten months, unanimous agreement was reached on fundamental issues such as opposing imperialism, opposing feudalism, opposing bureaucrat-capitalism, overthrowing the rule of the Kuomintang reactionaries, and the program and steps for building a New Democratic country.
    On this solid foundation of unity, after consultation among all parties, the Preparatory Committee for the New Political Consultative Conference was convened on June 15th in the Qinzheng Hall of Zhongnanhai in Beiping. This meeting consisted of three plenary sessions and two days of group meetings. The entire process of the meeting fully demonstrated an atmosphere of harmony and unity and a spirit of seeking truth from facts.
    At the opening ceremony on the first day, Zhou Enlai, member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Chinese Community Party and Vice Chairman of the Chinese People's Revolutionary Military Commission, served as temporary chairman and delivered the opening speech. Subsequently, Mao Zedong, Chairman of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, Zhu De, Commander-in-Chief of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, Li Jishen, Chairman of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang, Shen Junru, the responsible Central Standing Committee member of the China Democratic League, Guo Moruo, a non-party democratic personage, Chen Shutong, a democratic personage from industry, and Chen Jiageng, a democratic personage from overseas Chinese, delivered speeches. Chairman Mao pointed out in his speech that the time for convening the New Political Consultative Conference was fully ripe; the task of this preparatory committee "is to complete all necessary preparations, quickly convene the New Political Consultative Conference, and establish a democratic coalition government, so as to lead the people of the whole country at the fastest speed, to eliminate the remaining forces of the Kuomintang reactionaries, unify the whole of China, and systematically and step-by-step, carry out political, economic, cultural, and national defense construction work throughout the country." The speeches of Zhu De, Li Jishen, Shen Junru, Guo Moruo, Chen Shutong, Chen Jiageng, and others unanimously believed that the convening of this preparatory committee had important historical significance, and expressed strong confidence in uniting all the people to build a new China (full texts of the speeches are in a separate dispatch).
    In order to quickly complete all the necessary preparatory work for convening the New Political Consultative Conference and establishing a democratic coalition government, the Preparatory Committee decided to establish six groups under the leadership of the Standing Committee (list to be published tomorrow) to complete the following tasks respectively: 1. Draft the units participating in the New Political Consultative Conference and the number of representatives for each unit; 2. Draft the organizational regulations of the New Political Consultative Conference; 3. Draft the Common Program; 4. Draft the program for the government of the People's Republic of China; 5. Draft the declaration; 6. Draft proposals for the national flag, national anthem, and national emblem. After the adjournment of the conference, the Standing Committee and the above six groups will continue to work intensively so that the New Political Consultative Conference can be convened in the near future.

  　新政协筹备会在平成立
    首届全会通过筹备会组织条例和参加新政协
    各单位及其代表名额；并选出筹备会常委会。
    全会充分显示和谐团结气氛实事求是精神
    【新华社北平十九日电】新政治协商会议筹备会已于本月十五日在北平成立。历时五天的首届全体会议，业于今日下午六时半完满结束，宣告闭幕。大会一致通过了“新政治协商会议筹备会组织条例”（见另电）和参加新政协的四十五个单位及其五百一十名代表名额（明日发表），并选出毛泽东、朱德、李济深等二十一人（名单见另电），组成常务委员会，负责进行日常事务。常委会推出毛泽东为主任，周恩来、李济深、沈钧儒、郭沫若、陈叔通为副主任。

    召集新政治协商会议以建立民主联合政府的主张，是中国共产党在一九四八年“五一”口号中所提出的。中共的提议得到了全国民主阵营迅速的普遍的响应。代表各民主党派和各民主阶层的人士，去年八月开始，就陆续来到解放区，以便与中共共同进行新政协的筹备事宜。中共负责人曾与他们就各种国是问题，详尽地交换了意见。在历时约十个月的商谈中，对反对帝国主义、反对封建主义、反对官僚资本主义，打倒国民党反动派的统治，以及建设新民主主义国家的纲领和步骤等项根本问题，获得了一致的意见。
    在这一坚固团结的基础上，经各方协义之后，新政协筹备会于六月十五日在北平中南海勤政殿召开。这次会议一共开了三次的全体会和两天的小组会。会议的整个过程，充分显示出和谐团结的气氛和实事求是的精神。
    在第一天的开幕典礼上，由中共中央政治局委员，中国人民革命军事委员会副主席周恩来担任临时主席并致开幕词。接着，中国共产党中央委员会主席毛泽东，中国人民解放军总司令朱德，中国国民党革命委员会主席李济深，中国民主同盟负责中央常务委员沈钧儒，无党派民主人士郭沫若，产业界民主人士陈叔通，海外华侨民主人士陈嘉庚等均发表了讲演。毛主席在讲辞中，指出召开新政治协商会议的时机已经完全成熟；这个筹备会的任务，“就是完成各项必要的准备工作，迅速召开新政治协商会议，成立民主联合政府，以便领导全国人民以最快的速度，肃清国民党反动派的残余力量，统一全中国，有系统地和有步骤地在全国范围内，进行政治的，经济的，文化的和国防的建设工作”。朱德、李济深、沈钧儒、郭沫若、陈叔通、陈嘉庚等人的讲演，一致认为这个筹备会的召集具有重要的历史意义，并对团结全体人民建立新中国的前途，表示坚强的信心（讲词全文均见另电）。
    为了迅速完成召开新政治协商会议及建立民主联合政府的各项必要准备工作，筹备会决定在常务委员会领导之下设立六个小组（名单明日发表），分别完成下列各项任务，即：一、拟定参加新政治协商会议的单位及各单位的代表名额；二、起草新政治协商会议组织条例；三、起草共同纲领；四、拟定中华人民民主共和国政府方案；五、起草宣言；六、拟定国旗、国歌、国徽方案等。大会休会之后，常务委员会和上述六个小组将继续紧张的工作，以便新政治协商会议能于最近期间召集。
