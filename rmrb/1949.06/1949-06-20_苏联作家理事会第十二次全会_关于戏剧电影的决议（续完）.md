The plenary session pointed out an entirely intolerable fact: at various meetings of the All-Russian Theatrical Society and in the Central House of Literature, individual critics have repeatedly attacked the nation's outstanding realist theaters—the Gorky Moscow Art Theater and the Maly Theater—from formalist positions alien to us. These attacks have nothing in common with any specific critiques of these two theaters; the aim of the attacks is to shake the love and respect of Soviet writers and theater workers for these two theaters—the national pride of the Russian people and all Soviet people—from positions alien to Soviet art.

To date, the foundations of Marxist-Leninist theory of drama and acting have not been established, and a truly scientific history of pre-revolutionary and Soviet drama has not been created. The few theoretical works that have appeared in recent years contain significant shortcomings, such as bourgeois objectivism, a conciliatory attitude towards formalism, and sycophantic behavior towards Western European bourgeois culture.

The teaching at the State Theatrical Arts Academy still relies on formalist reference books and is often in the hands of professors and lecturers who do not stand on a Marxist-Leninist position.

The plenary session believes that the Presidium and Secretariat of the Writers' Union, as well as the Arts Committee, have made a serious mistake in that they have not yet exposed the aforementioned phenomena and have not drawn the necessary ideological and organizational conclusions to ensure the Party's direction of Soviet drama criticism and the education of new cadres of actors and directors. The Writers' Union's newspaper, "Literary Gazette," has not paid attention to the work of Soviet playwrights and critics, either in the past or present. The newspaper has published almost no articles analyzing the state of Soviet drama and criticism. It has not published articles that explore the lively new elements brought about by outstanding Soviet scripts with modern themes. The Writers' Union's magazines, "New World," "Banner," and "October," have not published outstanding plays by Soviet playwrights, thereby creating the idea of treating drama not as the highest, most difficult, and respected literary genre, but as "second-rate" literature.

The plenary session pointed out the unsatisfactory work of the Drama Committee of the Soviet Writers' Union (chaired by Comrade Kron), which is characterized by a lack of political concern, a lack of Bolshevik principles, and silence about the errors of the committee's workers (such as Comrade Maliugin). The committee has not conducted organizational work on creating scripts on modern themes and has not helped playwrights in the fraternal republics.

The plenary session of the Writers' Union instructed the Presidium and Secretariat to correct the shortcomings in work pointed out in this resolution and to take all measures to implement the Central Committee of the All-Union Communist Party's instruction: that the Writers' Union should guide playwrights to create for the further development of art and literature.

The plenary session of the Writers' Union instructed the Presidium and Secretariat to systematically attract outstanding writers from across the country to write scripts, to provide them with creative assistance, and to criticize their works from the viewpoint of modern tasks and high ideological and artistic requirements.

The Secretariat and Presidium of the Writers' Union should systematically discuss new scripts by Soviet playwrights at their meetings, and, in coordination with the Arts Committee, discuss the playwrights' creative work and individual performances. Theater workers and playwrights should participate in the discussions.

The plenary session instructed the Presidium and Secretariat of the Writers' Union to provide daily assistance to the work of playwrights in various republics and states, and to invite them to Moscow more often to discuss their creative work.

Special attention should be given to young cadres among playwrights of all nationalities.

The Secretariat should ensure that playwrights are sent to enterprises, new construction sites, collective farms, the military, schools, and scientific research institutions for creative purposes, and should discuss the playwrights' creative proposals and the results of their travels.

The plenary session pointed out that the shortcomings in the work of the Presidium and Secretariat of the Soviet Writers' Union are also inherent in the Councils of the Writers' Unions of various republics and the branches of the Writers' Unions of various border regions and states, and recommended that they take the necessary practical measures to eliminate these shortcomings.

The plenary session instructed the Presidium and Secretariat of the Writers' Union, with the help of advanced playwrights and outstanding Soviet drama critics, to expose anti-Party views that are harmful to Soviet playwriting and Soviet acting in central publications, in the "Literary Gazette," and in the magazines "New World," "Banner," "October," and "Star." These views are propagated by those who advocate art that does not participate in political life.

The plenary session instructed the Writers' Union's publications to wage an uncompromising struggle against this viewpoint from the standpoint of the Party spirit of art and from the standpoint of socialist realism. Crushing aestheticism, formalism, and criticism alien to Soviet art should be the beginning of launching Party-spirited criticism of the ideological and artistic shortcomings in modern drama.

The task of drama critics and literary critics is to support the advanced Party tendencies in drama, to educate writers in the spirit of Bolshevik Party spirit, and to treat their works with care.

The corrupt atmosphere of mutual cover-ups prevalent among drama critics must be eliminated. The tried and tested weapon of principled, ideological criticism and self-criticism should be used to promote the development of Soviet drama.

To this end, the plenary session believes it is necessary:

To replace the leadership of the Drama Committee with new forces capable of ensuring the Party's position in drama; and to propose to the Arts Committee and the Council of the All-Russian Theatrical Society: to abolish the All-Russian Theatrical Society's Drama Critics Union, which is a source of harmful viewpoints and theories that are incompatible with the spirit of Soviet art, that contradict the Party's instructions and the demands of the Soviet people; and to raise the issue of ensuring Bolshevik leadership in the All-Russian Theatrical Society's publishing endeavors.

To unite outstanding drama critics around the Writers' Union's publications, the "Soviet Art" newspaper, and the "Drama" magazine, as well as around the Writers' Union's Drama Committee;

To transform the "Drama" magazine into a joint publication of the Arts Committee and the Writers' Union, and to change its leadership;

To draw the attention of the government's film department, the Arts Committee, and the Architecture Committee to the need to strengthen the leadership of the "Soviet Art" newspaper;

To instruct the "Literary Gazette" (edited by Comrade Yermilov) to systematically clarify the situation and tasks of Soviet drama.

The plenary session drew the attention of the Arts Committee to the need to strengthen the organizational role of theaters in the work of compiling new performance repertoires, and to unite writers and playwrights around the theaters.

The plenary session instructed the chief editors of the magazines "New World," "Banner," "October," and "Star" to publish outstanding dramatic works on modern themes in their respective magazines.

The "Art" Publishing Bureau should publish, with sufficient circulation, the outstanding scripts of Soviet playwrights pointed out by the press and the Soviet public.

The plenary session of the Writers' Union also drew the attention of the Arts Committee to the poor situation in the lectures at the State Theatrical Arts Academy, and believed it necessary to correct this situation in the shortest possible time.

The plenary session instructed the Secretariat of the Writers' Union to examine the quality of teaching on drama issues in the Writers' Union and literary specialized schools.

The plenary session instructed the Presidium and Secretariat to strongly encourage the work of playwrights writing for children.

The plenary session instructed the Presidium and Secretariat to assist writers participating in the creation of musical dramas (operas, musical comedies, ballets).

The plenary session entrusted the Secretariat to develop specific measures to compile the performance repertoire of national amateur theaters.

The plenary session called on outstanding writers writing in the languages of all Soviet nationalities to compile an ideological and highly artistic performance program for our theaters. This repertoire can satisfy the demands and needs of Soviet audiences. Only by enhancing the playwrights' sense of responsibility to the Party and the people, resolutely fighting against formalist and aesthetic criticism and sycophantic behavior towards the bourgeois West, realizing the principle of Bolshevik Party spirit in Soviet drama, closely linking with life, deeply understanding the tasks of communist construction, and diligently studying artistic forms, can Soviet literature overcome the backwardness of drama, can decisive achievements be made in this important sector of Soviet art, and can the historically significant resolution of the Central Committee of the All-Union Communist Party "On the Repertoire of Theaters and Methods for Its Improvement" be fulfilled.

### 苏联作家理事会第十二次全会　关于戏剧电影的决议（续完）

专栏：

　　苏联作家理事会第十二次全会
  　关于戏剧电影的决议
    （续完）
    全会指出了一件完全不可容忍的事实，就是在全俄戏剧协会的种种会议上和在文学家中央大厦中，个别批评家从我们所陌生的形式主义的立场一再攻击全国优秀的现实主义的剧院——高尔基莫斯科艺术剧院和小剧院。这些攻击是与对于这两个剧院的某些错误的批评毫无共同之处的；攻击的目的是在从苏维埃艺术所陌生的立场上来动摇苏维埃文学家和戏剧工作者对于这两个戏院——俄罗斯人民与全体苏联人民的民族骄傲——的热爱和尊敬。
    直到现在，尚未制定关于马列主义的戏剧与演剧理论的基础，尚未造成俄罗斯革命前的及苏维埃的戏剧的真正科学的历史，近几年来所出现的少数理论著作，则含有极大的缺点：如资产阶级的客观主义，对形式主义的调和态度，及对西欧资产阶级文化的谄媚行为。
    国立戏剧艺术专科学校的授课，至今还是根据形式主义的参考书进行的，并且往往掌握在不是站立在马列主义立场的教授和讲师手中。
    全会认为作家协会主席团及书记处以及艺术委员会犯了一个大错误，就是它们至今尚未揭发上述种种现象，并且没有作出思想上和组织上的必要结论，以保证苏维埃戏剧批评的党的方向及保证对演员与导演的新干部的教育。作家协会的机关报“文学报”，过去和现在都没有注意苏维埃剧作家与批评家的工作。该报几乎没有分析苏维埃戏剧与批评情况的文章。该报没有登载文章，发掘用现代主题的优秀的苏维埃剧本所带来的活生生的新东西。作家协会的杂志：“新世界”、“旗帜”、“十月”，没有登载苏维埃剧作家的优秀剧本，从而造成了将戏剧不当作最高度的、不容易的、受尊敬的文学体裁而当作“次等”文学的观念。
    全会指出了苏联作家协会戏剧委员会（其主席是克龙同志）的令人不满意的工作，其特点是不关心政治，缺乏布尔什维克的原则性，对于该委员会工作者们（如玛流金同志）的错误保持沉默。该委员会没有进行关于创作现代主题的剧本的组织工作，并且也没有帮助各兄弟共和国的剧作家。
    作家协会全会责成主席团及书记处纠正本决议所指出的工作缺点，并采取一切办法执行联共中央的这一指示，就是：作家协会应该指导剧作家为艺术与文学的进一步的发展而创作。
    作家协会全会责成主席团及书记处有系统地吸引全国优秀作家来写作剧本，给予他们以创作上的帮助，并且从现代的任务和高度的思想要求与艺术要求这种见地来批评他们的作品。
    作家协会书记处及主席团应该在自己的会议上有系统地讨论苏维埃剧作家的新剧本，并且协同艺术委员会讨论剧作家的创作及个别的演出，讨论时应该有戏剧工作者和剧作家参加。
    全会责成作家协会主席团及书记处给各共和国和各州的剧作家的工作予以日常的帮助，多多邀请他们来莫斯科讨论他们的创作。
    对各民族剧作家中的青年干部应该给予特别的注意。
    书记处应该保证为创作而派遣剧作家到企业、新建筑物、集体农场、军队、学校及科学研究机关中去，应该讨论剧作家的创作意见书及其在各处旅行的结果。
    全会指出，苏联作家协会主席团及书记处的工作缺点，也为各共和国作家协会理事会以及各边疆区与各州作家协会分会所固有，并且向它们建议采取必要的实际办法来消除这些缺点。
    全会责成作家协会主席团及书记处在先进的剧作家以及优秀的苏维埃戏剧批评家的帮助下，在中央的各刊物上，在“文学报”上及“新世界”、“旗帜”、“十月”、“星”各杂志上，揭露对苏维埃剧作与苏维埃演剧有害的、反党的观点，这种观点是拥护不参加政治生活的艺术的人们所宣传的。
    全会责成作家协会的机关刊物、从艺术的党性的立场，从社会主义的现实主义的立场与这种观点作不妥协的斗争。粉碎唯美主义的、形式主义的、为苏维埃艺术所陌生的批评，应该成为对现代戏剧中思想上和艺术上的缺点展开有党性的批评的开端。
    戏剧批评家与文学批评家的任务，乃是支持戏剧中先进的党的倾向，以布尔什维克的党性的精神来教育作家，小心地对待他们的著作。
    必须清除盛行于戏剧批评家中间的相互掩饰错误的腐败气氛，应用原则性的、思想上的批评与自我批评这一考验过的武器，推进发展苏维埃戏剧的事业。
    为此，全会认为必须：
    以能够保证戏剧方面党的立场的新力量来代替戏剧委员会的领导；并向艺术委员会及全俄戏剧协会理事会提出：取消全俄戏剧协会戏剧批评家联合的问题，这种联合是有害的、与苏维埃艺术精神不能并立的、与党的指示及苏维埃人民的要求相抵触的观点和理论的策源地；并提出保证全俄戏剧协会出版事业中布尔什维克领导的问题。
    团结优秀的戏剧批评力量在作家协会各机关刊物、“苏维埃艺术”报与“戏剧”杂志的周围，以及在作家协会戏剧委员会的周围；
    使“戏剧”杂志变为艺术委员会及作家协会的共同的机关刊物，并更换其领导；
    提请政府电影部、艺术委员会及建筑术委员会注意必须巩固对“苏维埃艺术”报的领导；
    责成“文学报”（耶尔米洛夫同志主编）有系统地阐明苏维埃戏剧的情况与任务。
    全会提请艺术委员会注意，必须加强剧院在编订新的上演剧目这一工作上的组织作用，必须将作家和剧作家团结在剧院的周围。
    全会责成“新世界”、“旗帜”、“十月”、“星”，各杂志的主编在各自的杂志上登载有关现代主题的优秀的戏剧作品。
    “艺术”出版局应该以足够的发行额出版为报界及苏维埃公众所指出的苏维埃剧作家的优秀剧本。
    作家协会全会并且提请艺术委员会注意国立戏剧艺术专科学校讲课上的不良情形，并且认为必须在最短期间纠正这一情况。
    全会责成作家协会书记处检查作家协会、文学专科学校关于戏剧问题的讲授的质量。
    全会责成主席团及书记处极力鼓励为儿童而写作的剧作家的工作。
    全会责成主席团及书记处对参加创作乐剧（歌剧、音乐喜剧、舞剧）的作家予以帮助。
    全会委托书记处制定专门措施以编订全国业余剧院的上演剧目。
    全会号召苏联各民族文字写作的优秀作家们，编订我们戏院的有思想的，有高度艺术的上演节目。这种剧目可以满足苏维埃观众的要求和需要。只有提高剧作家对党和人民的责任心，与形式主义的，唯美主义的批评及对资产阶级西方的谄眉行为作坚决的斗争，实现苏维埃戏剧中布尔什维克党性的原则，与生活紧密地联系，深刻地了解共产主义建设的任务，对艺术形式的顽强研究，才能帮助苏维埃文学克服戏剧的落后性，才能在苏维埃艺术的这个重要部门内获得决定性的成绩，才能完成联共中央“关于剧院上演目录及其改进方法”的有历史意义的决议。
