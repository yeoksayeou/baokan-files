　　Inland Water Transport is Extensive and Well-Developed
    [Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 6th] Since the Shanghai Military Control Commission issued the order to restore inland river navigation, Shanghai's inland water transport industry has been increasingly restored. There are a total of 35 river steamers operating on the Shanghai-Changzhou line, the Shanghai-Hangzhou line, the Shanghai-Wuxing line, the Shanghai-Wusong line, and the Shanghai-Zhenjiang line. The Pudong-Fengxian line and the Pudong-Nanhui line have also been opened. Tugs and barges ply back and forth along the Huangpu River wharves, and it is estimated that the tugs and barges operating on this line account for more than 20% of the total number of tugs and barges in Shanghai and Hong Kong. The number of ships on each line is still increasing daily.
