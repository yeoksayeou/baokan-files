A Taiwanese female revolutionary who once spent eighteen years in prison – Xie Xuehong, is the chairman of the Taiwan Democratic Self-Government League and is representing the All-China Youth Federation in the preparatory meeting of the New Political Consultative Conference. When the reporter interviewed her at the meeting, she first said: The significance of this New Political Consultative Conference is significant. The news of the opening of this meeting will inevitably arouse the joy of the people all over the country, and the people all over the country will see a bright and splendid prospect. From any aspect, this meeting is completely different from all previous meetings. This meeting is convened by the Chinese people completely independently and autonomously. No will of any imperialism can affect it here, and it is completely free from interference. On the other hand, the will of domestic feudalists, bureaucratic bourgeoisie, and Kuomintang reactionaries is not allowed to play any role. This meeting does not include them; only truly patriotic people are included. Therefore, this united front is very broad and solid. The highest form of this united front is the new political consultative conference to be convened quickly under the preparation of this meeting.

Today, the Chinese people must not relax their vigilance against the conspiracies of the reactionaries because of victory. Precisely because of this, the struggle of the Taiwanese people is even more important. The US-Chiang reactionaries may妄想 continue to engage in conspiracies against the Chinese people in Taiwan. Chairman Mao called on the people of the whole country to unite and thoroughly smash the reactionary conspiracy plan. Undoubtedly, we, the people of Taiwan, will bravely and firmly shoulder this important task to respond to Chairman Mao’s call. Despite any conspiracy plans of the reactionaries in Taiwan, they are bound to fail. Because the revolutionary forces of the Chinese people have become strong enough to defeat any enemy and overcome any difficulties, it is undoubtedly certain that the Chiang-US reactionaries in Taiwan will be completely defeated. The people of Taiwan have also realized that they must stand with the people of the whole country, complete the current revolutionary tasks, to get a bright future.

Today, the internal united front in Taiwan is stronger than ever. Even some landlords and bourgeoisie in Taiwan today express their resentment against the collusion between the Chiang Kai-shek reactionary group and US imperialism. Today, the people of Taiwan are eagerly looking forward to the realization of the national people’s regime and smashing the conspiracy of US imperialism to split Taiwan from China and turn it into a colony. Therefore, the people of Taiwan being able to participate in this New Political Consultative Conference is a great encouragement to them. When they hear about the opening of this conference, they will surely rise up and support this conference with practical actions.

Then she talked about the situation in Taiwan, saying: There are generally two views on Taiwan. One is that the power of the US-Chiang in Taiwan is quite strong, so the victory of the revolution will be hindered. The other view is that the power of the Taiwanese people is quite strong, so the liberation of Taiwan can be counted on day by day. Obviously, the first view overestimates the enemy's strength. Today, the people of Taiwan are different from two years ago. During the February 28th Incident, although the people of Taiwan were very brave, they did not see the bright side very clearly. Now they can see it completely. At the same time, there are contradictions between the US and Chiang in Taiwan. Although the US and Chiang are united in dealing with the people of Taiwan, there are many internal contradictions, because the people of Taiwan have no illusions about Chiang Kai-shek, and it is also difficult for the Americans to use Chiang Kai-shek, so they want to support pro-American elements in Taiwan to demand trusteeship or "independence" and abandon Chiang Kai-shek. This contradiction weakens the strength of Chiang and the US in Taiwan. There are also many internal contradictions among the Chiang Kai-shek reactionaries. After his reactionary government moved to Taiwan, it conflicted with the local situation in Taiwan. In addition, Chiang Kai-shek's bureaucratic bourgeois rogue style aroused the resistance of the large and medium-sized bourgeoisie and landlords in Taiwan. In the past, the large and medium-sized bourgeoisie and landlords were Chiang's accomplices. Now some of these people have wavered, some are passive, and some have already approached the revolutionary forces. This makes Chiang Kai-shek very isolated in Taiwan.

It is said that Chiang Kai-shek's remaining military forces in Taiwan are only more than 100,000 people. The navy also has no strength. It is said that the air force is all in Taiwan, with a total of four squadrons, about two hundred aircraft, but it is ridiculous to say that most of them are used for "moving". In addition, there are 500,000 young people in Taiwan who have received military training, but Chiang Kai-shek does not value these young people because they are close to the people. If the People's Liberation Army hits Taiwan, these 500,000 young people will rise up and automatically seize the weapons of the reactionaries and cooperate with the People's Liberation Army, just like the experience of February 28th, they can be called and organized through radio stations. These people were well trained by the Japanese invaders in the past, and today they can become the force for liberating the people of Taiwan. Now the awareness of the people of Taiwan has been greatly improved. In the past, there was a estrangement with people from other provinces, but now it has been eliminated, and they can unite to overthrow the common enemy. Therefore, it is possible for the people of the whole of Taiwan to cooperate with the liberation of the whole country!

### 谢雪红先生谈新政协与台湾问题

　　谢雪红先生谈新政协与台湾问题
    一个曾经继续坐牢十八年的台湾女革命家——谢雪红，她是台湾民主自治同盟的主席，这次代表了全国青联参加新政协筹备会。记者在会上访问她的时候，首先她说：这次新政协召开的意义是重大的。这个会议开幕的消息发表出来必然的会引起全国人民的欢欣鼓舞，全国人民都会看到一幅光明灿烂的远景。这次会议由任何方面来看，它与过去一切会议都是完全不同的。这次会议是由中国人民完全独立自主地来召开的，任何帝国主义的一点点意志都不能在这里发生影响，是完全不受干涉的；另一方面国内封建主义者，官僚资产阶级，国民党反动派的意志也不许起一点作用。这次会议没有包括他们，只有真正爱国的人民都包括在内，所以这次统一战线是非常广泛和巩固的；而这个统一战线的最高形态，就是由这次会议迅速准备召开的新的政治协商会议。
    今天中国人民切不可因为胜利而放松对反动派阴谋的警惕性。正因为这样，台湾人民的斗争就更加显得重要；美蒋反动派很可能妄想在台湾继续干反对中国人民的阴谋。毛主席号召全国人民团结起来彻底粉碎反动派的阴谋计划，无疑的我们台湾人民会勇敢而坚强地担负起这一重大的任务，来响应毛主席的号召。尽管反动派在台湾有任何阴谋计划，他必然是要失败的。因为中国人民的革命力量，已经强大到足以战胜任何敌人和克服任何困难，所以将会完全战胜在台湾的蒋美反动派是毫无疑问的。台湾人民也已经觉悟到必须和全国人民站在一起，完成当前革命的任务，才能得到一条光明的出路。
    今天台湾内部的统一战线是比任何时候都要强大得多，甚至连台湾的某些地主和资产阶级，在今天也对蒋介石反动集团与美帝国主义的勾结表示愤恨。今天台湾人民热烈地期待着全国人民政权的实现，粉碎美帝国主义企图把台湾从中国分裂出去变成殖民地的阴谋。所以台湾人民能够得到参加这次新政协，对他们的鼓舞是很大的，当他们听到这次会议开幕之后，一定会起来用实际行动拥护这个会议。
    接着她谈到台湾的情况说：大家对台湾一般有两种看法，一是认为美蒋在台湾的力量相当强大，因此革命的胜利是要受到阻碍的。另外一种看法是认为台湾人民力量相当强大，因此台湾的解放是可计日成功的。很显然的，第一种看法是过高地估了敌人的力量。今天台湾人民和两年前不同了，二、二八事变时，台湾人民虽然非常英勇，但对光明这一面还看不明显，现在是可以完全看得清楚了。同时美蒋在台湾是有矛盾的，虽然美蒋对付台湾人民是一致的，但内部有许多矛盾，因为台湾人民对蒋介石毫无幻想，美国人想利用蒋介石也是很困难的，所以又要扶植在台的亲美分子来要求托管或“独立”，丢掉蒋介石。这种矛盾就削弱了蒋美在台湾的力量。蒋介石反动派的内部矛盾也很多，他的反动政府陆续搬到台湾以后，就和台湾地方矛盾起来了。另外蒋介石官僚资产阶级流氓的作风，引起了台湾大中资产阶级地主的反抗。过去大中资产阶级地主是蒋家的帮凶，现在这些人有的就动摇了，有的消极，也有的已经靠近革命力量这方面来了。这样就使得蒋介石在台湾非常孤立。
    蒋介石在台湾的兵源残余势力，据说只有十万多人，海军方面也是没有什么力量的，空军据说都在台湾，共有四个大队，大约有二百架飞机，但说起来可笑，大部分都是用去“搬家”用的。另外在台湾有受过军训的五十万青年，但蒋介石不重用这些青年，因为他们是靠近人民的。如果人民解放军打到台湾去，这五十万的青年就会起来自动夺取反动派武器，配合解放军，象在二、二八的经验一样，在广播电台上就可把他们号召和组织起来。这些人是过去日寇给我们训练好的，今天能成为解放台湾人民的力量。现在台湾人民的觉悟已经大大的提高了，过去有过和外省人的隔阂，现在已经消除，能够团结一致打倒共同的敌人。所以全台湾的人民是可能配合全国的解放的！
