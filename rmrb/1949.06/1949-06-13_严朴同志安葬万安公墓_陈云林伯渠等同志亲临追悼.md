　　[Report from this newspaper] The memorial service and burial ceremony for Comrade Yan Pu, a member of the Communist Party of China, was held yesterday (12th) at the Wan'an Cemetery in the western suburbs of Beiping. Attendees included Central Committee members of the CPC Chen Yun, Lin Boqu, Dong Biwu, Lu Dingyi, Chen Shaomin, other comrades from various organs, and family and friends of Comrade Yan Pu, as well as doctors, nurses, and workers from the Beiping Hospital who treated Comrade Yan Pu. The mourning hall was filled with wreaths and eulogies from various circles of the Party, government, military, and academia, as well as from various democratic parties and people's organizations. The eulogy from the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China read: "Comrade Yan Pu, loyal and devoted, worked diligently, lived a simple and austere life, and was a good member of the Communist Party of China." The wreaths sent by Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu demonstrated the honor and mourning that Comrade Yan Pu received for his loyal service to the Party and the people for twenty-five years.
　　The memorial service was conducted in a solemn and somber atmosphere. After the dirge was played and the wreath from Chairman Mao was presented, Comrade Chen Yun, an old comrade-in-arms of Comrade Yan Pu, delivered a speech. He said: Comrade Yan Pu participated in the revolution for twenty-five years, was arrested twice, was brave in the face of the enemy, and bowed his head to the people. He lived a simple and austere life and never considered himself when doing work, which is worthy of study by all Party members. Comrade Lin Boqu said in his speech that Comrade Yan Pu was a typical example of an intellectual who had been transformed and was worthy of study by all men and women, old and young, who are advancing in China. Comrade Lu Dingyi recalled in his speech: "Comrade Yan Pu, even when lying in bed, often asked if it was raining and whether there would be a drought." He also often calculated how much millet the medical expenses would amount to. His will contained a review of his work and self-criticism, and he put forward suggestions to pay more attention to education work. Even until he fell into a coma, he kept shouting: "Down with imperialism!" Comrade Yan's family members, while crying, gave a reply, saying that they would work hard, study hard, and fight to the end for the cause of the people to commemorate Comrade Yan Pu. Finally, the burial ceremony was completed in the solemn singing of the Internationale.

  　陈云林伯渠等同志亲临追悼
    【本报讯】中国共产党党员严朴同志追悼会和安葬典礼，昨（十二）日在北平西郊万安公墓举行。参加者有中共中央委员陈云、林伯渠、董必武、陆定一、陈少敏及其他机关同志和严朴同志家属亲友，为严朴同志治疗的北平医院的医师、护士、工友等。灵堂里遍布党、政、军、学各界和各民主党派、人民团体所送的挽词、花圈。中国共产党中央委员会所送挽词上写着：“严朴同志，忠心耿耿，埋头工作，艰苦朴素，是中国共产党的好党员。”和毛主席、朱总司令所送的花圈，显示着严朴同志为党为人民忠诚服务二十五年所获致的哀荣。
    追悼仪式在严肃、沉重的空气中进行，在奏了哀乐，献了毛主席送的花圈以后，即由严朴同志的老战友陈云同志讲话，他说：严朴同志参加革命二十五年，被捕过两次，在敌人面前勇敢，在人民面前低头，生活刻苦朴素，做工作从不考虑自己，值得全体党员学习。林伯渠同志讲话说明严朴同志是知识分子改造了的典型，值得全中国前进的男女老少来学习。陆定一同志讲话中追忆说：“严朴同志躺在病床上了，还时常问天下雨了没有？会不会成旱灾？”又常常计算着医药用费折合多少小米。他的遗嘱上写的是工作检讨和自我批评，和提出意见要多注意教育工作。一直到最后昏迷时，还不断喊着：“打倒帝国主义！”严同志的家属一面哭一面致答词，要以好好工作，好好学习，为人民事业奋斗到底来纪念严朴同志。最后，在庄严的国际歌声中安葬典礼告成。
