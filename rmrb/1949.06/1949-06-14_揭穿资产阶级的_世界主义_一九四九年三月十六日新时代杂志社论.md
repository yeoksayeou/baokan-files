Editor's Note: In the report of the Chinese delegation attending the World Congress of Supporters of Peace, "cosmopolitanism" was mentioned, advocated by the reactionary Garry Davis, with the aim of sacrificing the sovereign independence of all countries to obey the American hegemonic "cosmopolitanism." Therefore, it is the ideology of all reactionary bourgeois parties, fascist bandits, and lackeys of American imperialism. This reactionary ideology has recently poisoned many workers in the Soviet literary, scientific, and especially philosophical circles. Therefore, the Soviet Communist Party is exposing its essence to strengthen the ideological arming of the Soviet people.

For several weeks, the Soviets have been focusing on exposing the essence and role of bourgeois "cosmopolitanism." This bourgeois "cosmopolitanism" has poisoned the "anti-patriotic faction" in theatrical and literary criticism, and has poisoned many workers in the fields of film, literature, art, drama, science, and especially philosophy.

This "anti-patriotic faction" of "cosmopolitanism" uses methods of ideological sabotage to undermine socialist culture in literature, drama, film, and painting. They attempt to deprive literature, art, and science of their party spirit, to eliminate their active ideological content and vibrant Soviet patriotism. "Cosmopolitans" oppose the socialist realism of Soviet literature and art, and oppose the healthy and optimistic spirit of Soviet literature and art. They slander writers and playwrights who strive to reflect reality and create authentic prototypes of communist builders in their works. "Cosmopolitans" ridicule complete characters and the sound ideals of Soviet people. Soviet people do not have, and abhor, Hamlet-like spiritual contradictions, double personalities, pessimistic despair, and passive ideas. In the literature and art of all Soviet nationalities, as in real life, Soviet characters who have faith in the future, recognize their own strength, and are full of enthusiasm for action are dominant. This is what makes the cosmopolitans very unhappy.

The anti-patriotic activities of this faction in literary criticism are mostly carried out covertly and secretly. This is not difficult to understand, because a faction of this nature will not be supported by public opinion. Soviet society is so sound that every anti-people faction has to disguise and conceal itself and engage in activities in secret. Otherwise, they will be immediately exposed and suffer a fatal blow.

"Cosmopolitanism" attempts to undermine the foundations of Soviet art. Under the pretext of discussing the artistic merits or demerits of this or that work, they propagate formalism and aesthetic vulgar viewpoints, advocating the castration of the ideological content of literature and art. The lack of ideological content is precisely the characteristic of the literary forgeries that American imperialists impose on the people of the world. However, art lacking content, art that is irrelevant to the masses and social issues, is not true art.

"Cosmopolitans" are intoxicated with slavish worship of decadent and corrupt bourgeois culture, while heaping insults on everything Soviet, progressive, and patriotic. They try (although in vain) to separate art from the people, building a chasm between them. In short, they are doing exactly what Malraux, the open agent of American imperialism in Western Europe, is doing. In his recent essay called "Letter to Intellectuals," he said: "The less one is bound by one's own country (people), the more independent one is!"

"Cosmopolitans" intend to uproot the national roots of great Russian literature and art. It should be pointed out that this intention to undermine the national cultural foundations of a nation is for the purpose of more easily accepting counterfeit American culture.

This anti-patriotic activity is essentially an anti-people activity. It runs counter to the entire line of communism and is strongly opposed by the entire Soviet people, especially cultural and scientific workers.

The Soviet people oppose "cosmopolitanism." It is distinctly different from Soviet culture, which has national forms and socialist content. All Soviet nationalities have a legitimate patriotic pride in their cultural achievements. The contributions of the great Russian people to culture are well known and undeniable. Russians were pioneers in many major scientific fields. Russian culture, with its glorious traditions of revolution and humanitarianism, has always been outstanding. Russian science, literature, music, and painting have always been among the most progressive in the world. Today, under the conditions of socialist society, the superior economic and social system of the most progressive Soviet state in the world must produce superior Soviet art, science, and culture. Only the ignorant and the liars would deny this.

Soviet patriotism is one of the main driving forces of Soviet society. The creativity of the people is an inexhaustible source of strength for the Soviet state. When the superiority of the socialist system is so obvious that it can no longer be denied, lying bourgeois critics will say it is some kind of "miracle." It is here that we can find the answer to this "miracle."

Soviet patriotism is inseparably combined with patriotic internationalism (the ideology of the working class). The great socialist country has always been the center of attention for the working class all over the world, embodying their hopes and ideals.

With the rapid economic development of the socialist state, lively and creative ideas, science, culture, art, and literature are also flourishing. Being surrounded by capitalism, it is not a remarkably long time in history to eradicate all the ugly capitalist vestiges in people's minds in thirty years. However, in such a short period, our country has already achieved many successes in this regard. The Communist Party—the vanguard of the working class—is working tirelessly for the ideological education of the people in the struggle to build a communist society.

The post-war years have marked the Soviet Communist Party's intensive construction work on the ideological front. A series of decisions by the Party leadership in this area have historical significance. These documents have been widely known abroad. The decisions of the Central Committee of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) on literary issues when dealing with the Star and Leningrad magazines, the decisions on drama and film, and Zhdanov's speech during the discussion of Alexandrov's "History of Western European Philosophy," as well as the recent articles in the Party newspapers (Pravda and Culture and Life magazine) on exposing the anti-patriotic activities of some drama critics—all these documents are a link in the entire ideological front, and are guiding documents for the Communist Party in the struggle against the intrusion of bourgeois ideology and against the capitalist remnants in people's minds.

Although these documents relate to all aspects of the ideological front, they have one thing in common: they declare war on "political negationism" and "ideological negationism" in literature, art, and science. They argue that literature, art, and science must be subordinate to the Bolshevik party spirit. Soviet culture, literature, art, and science must serve a great purpose: namely, to build a progressive new society, to fight against reactionary forces and imperialism, to defeat the warmongers, to safeguard peace and democracy, and to build communism. Bourgeois objectivism is not accepted by Soviet writers, scientists, and artists, because it can cover up the infiltration of reactionary ideas from the shadows. At present, the great educational work engaged in by the Soviet Communist Party is significant and purposeful in strengthening the ideological arming of the Soviet people.

The superiority of communism has been confirmed by life itself. The communist ideology, full of lofty ideals of justice and humanitarianism, marks the victory of reason and justice over the barbaric and brutal bourgeois system of man exploiting man.

Bourgeois "cosmopolitanism" is the "official" ideology of Anglo-American imperialists in their quest for world hegemony. It strikes at national consciousness, despises patriotism, and denies national culture and national sovereignty. In modern times, "cosmopolitanism" is the ideology of all reactionary bourgeois parties, fascist bandits, and the right-wing of the Socialist Party (the minions of American imperialism). Their "cosmopolitanism" not only opposes the idea of national independence, but is also deeply hostile to genuine proletarian internationalism. The clamoring of the likes of Blum, Bevin, and Spaak about "European cooperation" and "Western European unity" is nothing more than a disguise for uniting world reactionary forces to resist the Soviet Union and the true democratic forces of the world.

"Cosmopolitanism" is the other side of the coin of racism and bourgeois nationalism. It is a vicious weapon to ideologically corrupt various nations and undermine their national consciousness. Its purpose is to undermine the strength of the struggles of various nations for national independence and freedom, and to suppress their resistance to imperialist enslavement. It attempts to gradually destroy the determination to defend national survival. All this is beneficial to the imperialist plunderers, and promotes their plan to establish world hegemony by force.

Therefore, the propaganda of bourgeois "cosmopolitanism" as the "official" ideology of Anglo-American imperialism occupies an important place in the tactics of imperialism. It is manifested in calls for the establishment of a "world state," a "world government," and "world citizenship."

The Soviet Union's active exposure of bourgeois "cosmopolitanism" is of great international significance. The Soviet Union, the first socialist country in the world, illuminates the path forward in the fields of life, science, and art. It is the general organ and representative of the most advanced and most progressive social thought.

The ruthless declaration of war on "cosmopolitanism" and the exposure of bourgeois "cosmopolitans" (those peddlers of bourgeois ideology) deals a fatal blow not only to the enemies of the Soviet Union, but also, generally speaking, to the anti-democratic camp of imperialism. At the same time, this struggle is a great contribution to the cause of international peace.

The exposure of the imperialist ideological essence of bourgeois "cosmopolitanism's" aggression is an integral part of the overall struggle of all nations for lasting peace and against the warmongers. Therefore, the struggle against bourgeois "cosmopolitanism" has international significance.

　　揭穿资产阶级的“世界主义”
  　一九四九年三月十六日新时代杂志社论
    镜澄译
    编者按：在出席世界拥护和平大会中国代表团报告书中，曾提到“世界主义”，系反动的加利台维斯所提倡，其目的则在牺牲各国主权独立以服从美国霸主的“世界主义”，因此，它是一切反动的资产阶级政党、法西斯匪徒们，以及美帝国主义奴仆们的思想。这种反动的思想，最近已毒染了苏联文艺、科学、特别是哲学界的许多工作者，因此，苏联共产党正揭发其本质，以加强苏联人民的思想武装。
    几周以来，苏联人正集中注意力揭发资产阶级“世界主义”的本质及其作用。这种资产阶级的“世界主义”已经毒染了戏剧和文学批评界中的“反爱国主义派”，毒染了电影、文学、艺术、戏剧、科学诸界，特别是哲学界的许多工作者。
    这一“世界主义”的“反爱国主义派”用破坏思想的方法，来破坏文学、戏剧、电影和绘画诸方面的社会主义文化。他们企图剥夺文学、艺术和科学底党性，取消其积极的思想内容和生气勃勃的苏维埃爱国主义。“世界主义者”反对苏联文艺底社会主义的现实主义，反对苏联文艺底健康和乐观的精神。他们诋毁在作品中努力反映现实和创造共产主义建设者的真实典型的作家和戏剧家。“世界主义者”嘲笑完整的人物和苏联人的健全的理想。苏联人没有，并且厌恶哈姆雷特式的精神矛盾、两重人格、悲观失望情绪和消极的思想。在苏联各民族的文艺中，和在现实生活中一样，具有对未来的信念，认识自己的力量和充沛着行动的热情的苏联人物占着统治地位。这是使世界主义者们大为不快的。
    文学批评界这一派别的反对爱国主义的活动，多半是在隐蔽下秘密进行的。这是不难了解的，因为，具有这种性质的派别不会受到舆论的拥护。苏维埃社会是如此健全，所以，每一种反人民的派别都不得不把自己伪装和隐蔽起来，在暗中从事活动。——否则，他们便会立即被揭发，遭受致命的打击。
    “世界主义”企图破坏苏联艺术的基础。他们借口讨论这个或那个作品在艺术上的优点或缺点，而进行宣传形式主义和唯美的庸俗观点，主张阉割文艺的思想内容。没有思想内容，这正是美帝国主义者强加于世界人民的文艺伪造品的特点。然而，缺乏内容的艺术，与群众的和社会的问题无关的艺术，不是真正的艺术。
    “世界主义者”沉醉于对颓废和腐朽的资产阶级文化的奴性的崇拜，而对一切苏联的、进步的和爱国的文化横加污辱。他们试图（虽然是徒然）把艺术和人民分离，在他们之间筑起一道鸿沟。总之，他们所作的这些，也正是美帝国主义在西欧的公开代理人戴高乐分子马尔洛正从事的工作。他在最近的一篇叫做“告知识份子书”的论文中，说：“越不为自己的国家（人民）所束缚，就越是一个独立的人！”
    “世界主义者”打算拔掉伟大的俄罗斯文艺的民族根蒂。应当指出，这种破坏一个民族的民族文化基础的意图，为的是更容易接受伪造的美国牌文化。
    这种反对爱国主义的活动实质上是一种反人民的活动。它和共产主义的整个路线背道而驰，受到全苏联人民，特别是文化和科学工作者的强烈反对。
    苏联人民反对“世界主义”。它和苏联文化截然不同。苏联文化具有民族的形式和社会主义的内容。苏联各民族对于他们文化上的成就有着正当的爱国的自豪。伟大的俄罗斯人民对于文化的贡献是众所周知和不容置辩的。俄罗斯人在许多主要的科学部门都占了先。有着革命的和人道主义的光荣传统的俄罗斯文化一向是杰出的。俄罗斯底科学、文学、音乐和绘画从来是世界上最进步的。今天，在社会主义社会条件之下，世界上最进步的苏维埃国家底优越的经济和社会制度，必然产生优越的苏联艺术、科学和文化。只有无知之徒和说谎的人才会否认这一点。
    苏联的爱国主义是苏维埃社会主要动力之一。人民的创造力是苏维埃国家底力量的不尽源泉。当社会主义制度的优越性已如此明显，不容再被否认的时候，撒谎的资产阶级的批评家们会说是什么“奇迹”。正是在这里，我们可以找到关于这个“奇迹”的解答。
    苏联的爱国主义和爱国的国际主义（工人阶级的思想）不可分地相结合着。伟大的社会主义国家一向是全世界工人阶级注意的中心，它体现了他们的希望和理想。
    随着社会主义国家的经济的急速发展，生动的富于创造性的思想、科学、文化、艺术和文学也灿然兴盛起来。处在资本主义包围之中，要在三十年间铲除人们思想中所有丑恶的资本主义的遗毒，在历史上说来并不是一个了不起长的时间。但是，就是在这样短短的期间内，我国在这方面已经获得许多成绩。共产党——工人阶级的先锋队在建设共产主义社会的斗争中，为人民的思想教育不疲倦地工作着。
    战后的几年标志着苏联共产党在思想战线上的紧张的建设工作。党的领导在这方面的一系列的决定具有历史的意义。这些文件已广泛地为国外所熟知。联共（布）中央委员会在处理星及列宁格勒二杂志时对文学问题的决定，关于戏剧和电影的决定，和日丹诺夫在讨论亚历山大洛夫的“西欧哲学史”一书时的发言，以及最近党报（真理报和文化与生活杂志）上关于揭发一些戏剧批评家的反对爱国主义的活动的论文——所有这些文件，是整个思想战线上的一个环节，是共产党在反对资产阶级思想侵入的斗争中，在反对人们思想中的资本主义残余时的指导性的文件。
    虽然这些文件涉及思想战线的各个方面，但它们具有一个共同点：即向“政治否定论”宣战，向文学、艺术和科学上的“思想否定论”宣战。他们主张，文艺和科学必须服从于布尔塞维克的党性。苏联文化、文学、艺术和科学必须服务于一个伟大的目的：就是，建立一个进步的新社会，与反动势力和帝国主义作斗争、击败战争贩子维护和平与民主，和建设共产主义。资产阶级的客观主义是不为苏联作家、科学家和艺术家所接受的，因为它可以掩护反动思想从暗中混入。目前，苏联共产党从事的伟大教育工作，其意义和目的是加强苏联人民的思想武装。
    共产主义的优越性已为生活本身所证实。充满着正义和人道主义的高尚理想的共产主义思想，标志着理性和正义对于野蛮和残暴的人剥削人的资产阶级制度的胜利。
    资产阶级“世界主义”是英美帝国主义者争取世界霸权的“官方”思想。它打击民族意识，鄙夷爱国主义，否认民族文化和民族主权。在现代，“世界主义”是一切反动的资产阶级政党、法西斯匪徒们，以及社会党右翼（美帝国主义的从仆们）的思想。它们底“世界主义”不仅反对民族独立的思想，而且深刻地敌视真正的无产阶级国际主义。勃鲁姆、贝文、斯派克之流关于“欧洲合作”和“西欧统一”的叫嚣，无非是联合世界反动势力抵抗苏联和全世界真正民主力量的掩饰。
    “世界主义”是种族论和资产阶级民族主义的另一面。它是一个使各民族思想腐朽，和破坏他们的民族意识的恶毒的武器。它的目的，在于破坏各民族争取民族独立和自由的斗争的力量，和镇压他们对于帝国主义的奴役的反抗。它企图逐渐摧毁保卫民族生存的决心。这一切均有利于帝国主义掠夺者，促进他们以武力建立世界霸权的计划。
    因此，作为英美帝国主义底“官方”思想的资产阶级“世界主义”的宣传，在帝国主义的策略上占着重要地位。它表现在建立“世界国家”、“世界政府”、“世界公民权”这一类的呼吁中。
    苏联积极地揭发资产阶级“世界主义”是有巨大的国际意义的。世界上第一个社会主义国家的苏联，照耀着生活、科学和艺术诸领域中的前进的道路。它是最先进的和最进步的社会思想的总机关和代表。
    向“世界主义”无情地宣战和揭发资产阶级“世界主义者”（那些资产阶级思想的私贩子们），不仅给苏联的敌人，而且一般说来，给予帝国主义的反民主阵营以致命的打击。同时，这个斗争对于国际和平事业是一伟大贡献。
    对资产阶级“世界主义”底侵略的帝国主义思想本质的揭露，是各民族争取持久和平与反对战争贩子的总斗争中的一个组成部分。因之，对于资产阶级“世界主义”的斗争有着国际的意义。
