　　On the Enthusiasm of Industrialists
    Guo Dali

    The lack of enthusiasm among many industrialists, or rather industrial capitalists, has become a widely discussed topic recently. This lack has been manifested in various notable facts: when a class with conflicting interests in some respects with the industrial capitalist class, namely the wage-earning class, puts forward certain demands, they always adopt a passive attitude, daring not or pretending not to express their opinions; when their businesses face a certain crisis, and prompt remedies are not taken, leading to the danger of failure, they are always too lazy to find solutions, preferring to watch it collapse, as if this is the best way to express their meaning; they no longer have the ambition to expand their businesses, but instead make do with what they have, following the original conventions, as if maintaining such a facade is only for some unspeakable reason. In short, in their businesses, they seem to play a purely passive role.

    The general public often explains the occurrence of this situation as a result of the proletarian-led revolution. Regardless of how many times the Communist Party leaders explain that the current stage is still in the stage of the New Democratic Revolution, and that industrial capitalists still have a long-term historical task in the New Democratic state, many industrialists still harbor doubts and dare not move forward courageously. This is a fact. However, the general public's view, even if not entirely without basis, cannot be said to be completely based, because it only states one aspect of the matter. Only by supplementing the other aspect of the matter can the truth be grasped.

    This so-called other aspect of the matter is as follows:

    China's industrial capitalists, generally speaking (that is to say, special exceptions naturally still exist), have always only been able to exert their capitalist enthusiasm, but have rarely been able to exert their industrialist enthusiasm. That is to say, as someone who wants to generate more value from a fixed amount of value, they are certainly active, even excessively active, but as an industrialist, as someone who wants to create greater use value from smaller use value, to create use value from no use value, they have always been passive and unenthusiastic. The evidence is here: almost every industrialist deals with government bonds, bid money, real estate, and various speculations. During the War of Resistance Against Japan, using commerce to support industry was also a common phenomenon.

    Of course, it is also unfair to completely attribute the passivity of industrialists to the industrialists themselves. There are various reasons why they, as industrialists, have no way to exert their enthusiasm. First, there is the invasion of imperialism. Imperialists, simply by virtue of their superior production conditions, can already defeat our industrialists and push their cheaper goods into our markets, thereby monopolizing our markets. Therefore, when they further obtain various special rights from unequal treaties, it is truly difficult for our industrialists to have room for existence and development, except to willingly become their vassals.

    Secondly, there are feudal exploitation relations. These feudal exploitation relations not only created all kinds of feudal regimes, which became accomplices of imperialism, and imposed various forms of constraints and infringements on various industries. It also, in a direct sense, completely destroyed the purchasing power of farmers—the most important component of the domestic market—with excessive rents. And in destroying the purchasing power of farmers in this way, it did not fill this deficiency encountered by national industries from other aspects. The income of landlords and tax collectors flowed outward in various ways, either to purchase various imported goods or to escape for safety reasons.

    Finally, the rule of bureaucratic capital created even more tragic results in this regard. Because there can be no bureaucratic capital without monopoly, bureaucratic capital is bound to be monopolistic from the beginning. It must be noted that the monopoly of bureaucratic capital is also the most outstanding of all monopolies. Its characteristic is that it is formed by means of oppression, so after it is formed, it cannot be without the effect of oppression. As a vassal of imperialism and the crystallization of feudal forces, it is like a whale, with the spirit to swallow the small animals of the entire sea. In this situation, every industrialist has a sense of insecurity. Struggling is often futile; relying on a certain force is rather a better strategy.

    Engaging in industry has long been a dead end for our capitalists who want to generate more value from a fixed amount of value. Theoretically and practically speaking, what can save them is the anti-imperialist, anti-feudal, and anti-bureaucratic-capitalist revolution. Therefore, the New Democratic Revolution cannot be the reason for the passivity of industrialists. Instead, it should be the reason for them to become more active. That is to say, the lack of enthusiasm among industrialists is a fact that has long existed. The question before us is rather how to correct this existing fact.

    This corrective work has now become one of the important tasks. The economy of a New Democratic society, as is well known, contains an important item of private capital economy. Under certain historical conditions, the society's material productive forces also require industrial capitalists to assume an important responsibility. They have capital, so they enjoy the right to develop social production; they have capital, so they also have the responsibility to develop social production. We must increase their (i.e., the industrialists') enthusiasm so that the progress of production can be accelerated, because socialism can only be built on the basis of advanced production.

    Therefore, the New Democratic Revolution itself, in a sense, should be the most important method of increasing the enthusiasm of industrialists. The purpose of this revolution is to oppose imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism. Without eliminating these, the development of industry is impossible. And after doing so, the New Democratic government will also establish appropriate monetary and banking systems, establish a rational taxation system, and establish a clear labor policy that takes all aspects into consideration, so that the difficulties encountered by industrial capitalists in the production process and circulation process can be resolved. Therefore, from now on, industrialists, as long as they do not engage in activities that are harmful to the national livelihood, can truly do something.

    Therefore, if there is still anything that will become a problem here, it is only because industrial capitalists are afraid of hearing about socialism and class theory. Therefore, education should fulfill its function. How to educate capitalists to change their mentality should be an important task. The arrival of socialism is inevitable. However, because the realization of socialism must be built on the basis of developing the productive forces, industrial capitalists, those who have contributed to the development of production, are rather meritorious for the realization of socialism. Therefore, we should clearly tell them what they can do and what they cannot do as industrialists.

    Of course, we should also allow industrialists to have a place to express their opinions and demands. The old-style representative politics dominated by the bourgeoisie is no longer applicable, but in the People's Congress, the representatives of industrialists also have their place.

　　论产业家的积极性
    郭大力
    许多产业家或者说产业资本家缺乏积极性这件事，已成为近来人们广泛谈论的资料了。这种缺乏，曾经表现在种种令人注目的事实上：当一个在若干方面和产业资本家阶级有相反利害关系的阶级，即工资劳动者阶级，提出某种要求时，他们总是采取消极的态度，不敢或装做不敢表示自己的意见；当他们的事业发生某种危机，不从速补救，即有失败危险时，他们总是懒得设法，却情愿看着它垮下去，好象这就是他们表示意思的最好的方法；他们已经没有扩大事业的雄心，而只因陋就简，照原有的成规做事，好象维持这样一个场面，也只是为了某种说不出口的理由似的。总之，在事业上，他们似乎只扮演一个纯然被动的角色了。
    一般人对于这种情形的发生，往往解释为无产阶级领导的革命的结果。不管共产党领导者再三解说目前仍是在新民主主义革命的阶段，产业资本家在新民主主义国家还有一个长期间的历史任务，许多产业家们还是怀着疑虑，而不敢勇往直前。这是事实。但一般人的看法，纵然不是全然没有根据，也不能说有完全的根据，因为它只说出了事情的一方面。必须把事情的另一方面补足起来，方才算把握住了真相。
    这所谓事情的另一方面是这样的：
    中国的产业资本家们，一般而论（那就是说，特殊的例外自然还是有的），一向来，就只曾发挥他们的资本家的积极性，却很少能够发挥他们的产业家的积极性。那就是说，当作一个想由定额价值生出更多价值的身份，他们固然是积极的，甚至过分积极的，但当作一个产业家，当作一个想由更小的使用价值造出更大的使用价值，由无使用价值造出使用价值的身份，他们一向来就是消极的，不起劲的。证据是在这里：几乎每一个产业家，都做公债、做标金、做地产、做种种投机。在抗战期间，以商养工，也几乎是普遍的现象。
    把产业家这种消极性完全归咎于产业家自己，当然也是不公道的。有种种事情，使他当作一个产业家，没有方法可以发挥他的积极性。首先有帝国主义的侵略。帝国主义者们，单是凭借他们的更优越的生产条件，已经可以打败我们的产业家，而把他们的更低廉的商品，推到我们的市场上来，并从而把我们的市场独占了。所以，当他们再取得不平等条约的种种特殊权益时，我们的产业家，除了甘心成为他们的附庸，就真正很难有存在和发展的余地了。
    其次，有封建的剥削关系。这种封建的剥削关系，不仅造成了各式各样的封建性的政权，成为帝国主义的帮凶，而以多种多样的束缚，和侵害，加在各种产业上面。它还在一种直接的意义上，以过重的租，把农民的购买力——国内市场最主要的成分——彻底破坏，而在这样破坏农民的购买力时，它并没有从别方面，为民族产业所遇到的这个缺陷填补起来。地主和收税人的收入，在以各种不同的方式，汇合向外滚流，以购买种种舶来的用品，或为安全的目的，而逃避出去。
    最后，官僚资本的统治，在这方面，还造成了更可悲的结果。因为没有独占，就不可能有官僚资本，所以官僚资本一开始就必然是独占的。必须注意，官僚资本的独占，还是一切独占中最为特出的。它的特征是由欺压的方法形成，所以形成之后，也不能没有欺压的作用。当作帝国主义的附庸和封建力量的结晶，它是象一条鲸鱼，有把整个海的小动物吞咽下去的气概。在这个局面下，每一个产业家都有朝不保夕之感。挣扎往往成为徒然的；投靠某种势力，倒宁就是一个上策了。
    搞产业，对于我们的要由定额价值生出更多价值的资本家，早就成了一条死路了。理论的说和实践的说，能够救他们出来的，只是反帝国主义，反封建，反官僚资本的革命。所以，新民主主义革命，不能是产业家消极的原因。而应该是他们转趋积极的原因，那就是说，产业家缺乏积极性，是一种早就存在的事实。摆在我们面前的问题，宁说是怎样才能把这个既有的事实改正过来。
    这种改正工作，到现在，已经成为诸种重要工作中的一项了。新民主主义社会的经济，如所周知，包含着私人资本经济这一个重要项目。社会的物质生产力，在一定的历史条件下，也需要产业资本家负起一种重要的责任。他们有资本，所以享有权利，可以发展社会的生产；他们有资本，所以也负有责任要发展社会的生产。我们要增加他们的（即产业家的）积极性，使生产的进步可以加速，因为社会主义只能建立在进步的生产的基础上。
    所以，新民主主义革命本身，在一种意义上说来，就应该是一种最重要的增进产业家积极性的方法。这个革命的目的，是反帝国主义，反封建，反官僚资本。不把这些消灭，产业的发展就是不可能的，并且，在这样做过之后，新民主主义的政府还会确立适当的货币制度和银行制度，会确立合理的课税制度，会确立明确的各方面全顾到的劳工政策，从而，使产业资本家们在生产过程中和流通过程中遇到的困难可以解除。所以，从此以后，产业家们，只要他们不从事于有害国民生计的活动，那是真正可以做一点事了。
    所以，在这里，如果还有什么会成问题，那就不过因为产业资本家害怕听社会主义，害怕听阶级理论。所以，教育应该尽它的功能。如何教育资本家，使其心理改变，该是一件重要的工作了。社会主义的到来是必然的。但因为社会主义的实现，必须建立在发展生产力的基础上，所以，产业家，曾经在生产发展上尽了力的产业家，对于社会主义的实现，宁说是有功的。所以，我们应当明白告诉他们，作为一个产业家，什么是他们可以做的，什么是他们不可以做的。
    当然，我们也应当让产业家有地方发表他们的意见和要求。旧式的由资产阶级支配的代议政治已经不适用了，但在人民代表大会中，产业家的代表，也是有它的地位的。
