　　Northeast Anti-Epidemic Team Arrives in Chahar League to Treat Livestock Plague
    [Chahar News] The Northeast Anti-Epidemic Team, consisting of more than 30 people, arrived at the Chahar League government on May 26 to assist in eradicating cattle plague. The cattle plague in Chahar League began in Ming'an and Zhenglan banners in November of last year and has spread to Zhengbai Banner, Shangdu Banner, Xianghuang Banner, and Zuyindi in the past six months. Due to the lack of veterinarians and poor skills, they were helpless against the cattle plague. In addition, the leadership of the League and banners was careless, resulting in the death of more than 1,000 cattle, which is a great threat to the development of grassland animal husbandry. Two months ago, the League government held a veterinary symposium and formed an anti-epidemic committee to study ways to treat the plague. After two months of intensive prevention and treatment, the cattle plague in Ming'an, Zhenglan, and Taiyou banners has stopped spreading. However, indigenous methods cannot completely eradicate the plague; it stops here and then occurs there. To this end, the League government specially invited the Northeast Anti-Epidemic Team to come and assist in order to effectively and thoroughly eradicate the cattle plague. When the Northeast Anti-Epidemic Team arrived, they were warmly welcomed by the people of Chahar League. At present, cadres and people from all Leagues and banners have been urgently mobilized to fight for the complete eradication of the cattle plague.

　　东北防疫队到察盟治畜瘟
    【察哈尔讯】东北防疫队三十余人，已于五月二十六日到达察盟政府，协助扑灭牛瘟。察盟牛瘟于去年十一月开始发生于明安、正蓝等旗，半年来蔓延至正白旗、上都旗、厢黄旗和租银地。由于兽医缺乏，技术又差，对牛瘟束手无策，加之盟旗领导上的麻痹大意，以致病死牛一千余头，对草地牧畜业的发展是个很大的威胁。两月前，盟政府召开兽医座谈会，组成了防疫委员会，研究了治瘟办法，经两月的突击防治，明安、正蓝、太右各旗牛瘟已停止了蔓延。但土办法是不能彻底根除的，这里停止了那里又发生了。为此，盟政府特邀请东北防疫队前来协助，以便有效地彻底地扑灭牛瘟。当东北防疫队到达后，受到察盟人民的热烈欢迎，现各盟旗干部及人民已紧急动员起来，为彻底扑灭牛瘟而奋斗。
