Xinhua News Agency, Qiongya, 14th—School education in the Qiongya Liberated Area has gradually developed in recent years along with the victorious situation of the revolution. At present, there are three cadre schools on the island: Qiongya Public School, Qiongya Military and Political School, and Qiongya Women's School. An administrative school is also in preparation.

　　　　Qiongya Public School
    Qiongya Public School is a school for cultivating cadres for the Qiongya People's Revolutionary Struggle. It was first established in the Qiongxi Anti-Japanese base area in 1940 and ran for two terms before it was suspended due to the Kuomintang's anti-communist upsurge. It was rebuilt in 1945 and ran for one term, but was also suspended due to the outbreak of the civil war. In these three terms, it trained more than 1,000 cadres, which played a significant role in supporting the isolated island's war of resistance and the people's liberation war. Last year, the People's Government decided to rebuild it. After several months of planning and management, it officially opened on March 20 this year. The school currently has more than 420 students, most of whom are middle school students from various counties in Qiongya, and some are young people from Nanyang, Guangdong, and Fujian. The principal is Shi Dan, an old revolutionary educator from Qiongya who is currently the director of the Education Department of the Qiongya People's Government. There are more than 20 faculty members, most of whom are cadres who have gone through long-term struggles, and some are intellectuals who have newly come from the Kuomintang-controlled areas. The current policy of the school is to train middle and lower-level administrative, civil affairs, military, cultural, educational, and financial cadres, focusing on political and ideological education and the study of revolutionary work knowledge. Students are divided into high, middle, and primary levels according to their political and cultural standards. The main subjects are On New Democracy, The Chinese Revolution and the Chinese Communist Party, CCP Policy, Mass Work, and General Knowledge of Culture. There are also special lectures by leading comrades of the Party and government every week. In addition to clothing and utensils, everything is provided by the school. The teachers and students in the school study and live very intensely. The students have a high degree of awareness and enthusiasm for learning. Most of the school buildings were built by the teachers and students themselves. Since the beginning of the school, two field work teams with a total of more than 100 people have been organized to serve on the front lines.

　　　　Qiongya Military and Political School
    Qiongya Military and Political School is sponsored by the Qiongya Column Headquarters and specializes in training and reforming company and platoon-level military and political cadres of the column and local armed forces. There are currently 300 students, all of whom are selected from the various units of the column and local armed forces. The principal is General Feng Baiju, commander of the Qiongya Column, and there are 18 faculty members. The military and political classes are each divided into high and primary levels. In addition to learning military and political work skills, emphasis is placed on class, policy, and discipline education. Each term lasts three months.

　　　　Qiongya Women's School
    Qiongya Women's School specializes in training cadres for village-level administrative, women's movement, cultural and educational, and other work. Qiongya women have made great contributions to the long-term revolutionary struggle. Many female comrades have been tempered through ten or eight years of struggle. The most difficult thing for them is their low cultural level, which makes it difficult for them to take on more complex work. The Women's School mostly absorbs these female comrades who have gone through long-term struggles, and provides them with practical work knowledge education on the basis of improving their cultural level. There are currently 121 students in the school, divided into half-year, one-year, and literacy classes. Many students have been selected to go to Qiongya Public School for further study and have been promoted to various work positions.

    In addition, under the leadership of the People's Government's special commissioner's offices and county governments, there are more than 30 higher and primary elementary schools with more than 1,000 students. The Li and Miao Autonomous Region has opened a Li and Miao Cadre School, and 120 students are receiving training.

　　琼崖解放区学校教育发展
    【新华社琼崖十四日电】琼崖解放区的学校教育，近年来已随着革命的胜利形势而日渐发展。现全岛有琼崖公学、琼崖军政学校、琼崖妇女学校等干部学校三所。还有行政学校一所在筹办中。
    　　　　琼崖公学
    琼崖公学是培养琼崖人民革命斗争干部的学校，一九四○年在琼西抗日根据地开始建立时，就办过二期，后因国民党掀起反共高潮而停办。一九四五年再建，办过一期，后也因为内战爆发而停办。在这三期中，共培养了一千多名干部，对支撑孤岛抗战和人民解放战争有很大作用。去年人民政府决定重建，经几个月的筹划经营，于今年三月二十日正式开课。全校现有学生四百二十余名，大多数是琼崖各县中学学生，也有一部分从南洋、广东、福建来的青年。校长是琼崖老革命教育家现任琼崖人民政府教育厅长史丹兼任，教职员二十余人，大部分是经过长期斗争的干部，也有一部分是新从国民党统治区来的知识分子。该校目前的方针是培养中下级行政、民运、部队、文教、财经干部，注重政治思想教育和革命工作知识的学习。学生按照政治、文化水准，分为高、中、初三级，主要课目是新民主主义论、中国革命与中国共产党、中共政策、群众工作、文化常识，每周还有党政负责同志的专题讲座。学生除衣服用具外，一切均由学校供给。全校师生学习、生活非常紧张，学生觉悟程度和学习情绪都很高，学校房舍大部分是由师生动手建筑起来的。从开学到现在，已组织了二个战地工作队共百余人，到前线服务。
    　　　　琼崖军政学校
    琼崖军政学校是琼崖纵队司令部主办的，专门培养和改造该纵队及地方武装的连、排级军、政干部。现有学生三百人，都是由该纵队各部队及地方武装选送来的。校长由琼崖纵队司令员冯白驹将军兼任，教职员有十八名。军事班和政治班各分为高、初两级，除学习军事和政治工作业务外，注重阶级、政策、纪律教育，每期三个月毕业。
    　　　　琼崖妇女学校
    琼崖妇女学校专门培养村级行政、妇运、文教等项工作的干部。琼崖妇女在长期革命斗争中，贡献很大，不少女同志是经过十年、八年斗争锻炼的，她们最感困难的是文化水准低，难以担任较复杂的工作。妇女学校大部分吸收这些经过长期斗争的女工作同志，在提高文化水平的基础上，并给予实际工作知识教育。全校现有学生一百二十一名，分为半年、一年、文盲补习三班。不少学生已经被选送琼崖公学深造，并提拔到各种工作岗位上去。
    此外，在人民政府各专署、县府领导下，还有高、初级小学三十多所，学生一千余名。黎苗自治区开办了黎苗干部学校，受训的学生有一百二十名。
