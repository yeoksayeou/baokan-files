　　Xinhua News Agency, Beiping, 25th: Tianjin Progressive Daily published an editorial on the 22nd titled "From Japanese Reparations to the Peace Treaty with Japan," emphasizing that the peace treaty with Japan should be prepared quickly, and the democratic coalition government that the Chinese people are about to establish will send representatives to participate. Only this new government can represent China. Any unilateral handling of the Japanese issue without the consent of the Chinese people is illegal and invalid. The newspaper condemned the U.S. government's statements of May 12th and June 10th regarding the cessation of Japanese reparations as "distorting the truth and confusing right and wrong," with the aim of reviving Japanese military industry and making Japan a U.S. arsenal in the Far East. The newspaper said that China's sacrifices in the War of Resistance numbered in the millions, and non-military losses are estimated at over 40 billion U.S. dollars. The total value of all Japanese reparations factories to be dismantled under U.S. control is less than 2 billion U.S. dollars, and even if all were given to China, it would only compensate us for less than one-twentieth of the people's losses. However, the MacArthur interim reparations plan only allowed the relocation of 30 percent, of which China nominally received half, but the Kuomintang government managed to move less than 10 million U.S. dollars in three years. Later, the U.S. reduced the amount of reparations again and again. Now it has unilaterally announced the cessation of reparations. This is something the Chinese people can never agree to. The editorial pointed out that U.S. and British imperialism, in violation of the Potsdam Agreement and the Moscow Declaration, stubbornly put forward the eleven-nation conference under their absolute control to replace the Council of Foreign Ministers, attempting to manipulate and monopolize everything. Their purpose is to delay and cancel the peace treaty with Japan, allowing MacArthur to forever be the "Emperor" of Japan, enslaving and driving the Japanese nation to be a robber and cannon fodder for U.S. imperialism in the Far East. The newspaper supports the position recently reiterated by Soviet representative Vyshinsky at the Paris Council of Foreign Ministers, namely, that the foreign ministers of the Soviet Union, the United States, China, and the United Kingdom should prepare the peace treaty with Japan. The editorial concluded: The solution of the Japanese problem "concerns China's national destiny, the welfare of the people of the Far East, world peace, and even more so the fate of the Japanese nation. The people's forces of all countries concerned with Japan and the Japanese people should unite, resolutely struggle against the U.S. and British imperialist policy towards Japan, and believe that our struggle will be victorious."

　　天津进步日报强调指出
  　迅速准备对日和约
  　联合政府才能代表中国
    【新华社北平二十五日电】天津进步日报二十二日发表题为“由日本赔偿说到对日和约”的社论，强调指出：对日和约应迅速准备，中国人民即将建立的民主的联合政府将派代表参加，只有这个新政府可以代表中国。不得中国人民的同意，任何对日本问题的片面处置，都是非法的，无效的。该报谴责美国政府于五月十二日和六月十日所发表的关于停止日本赔偿的声明是“强调害理，颠倒是非”，目的在于复兴日本军事工业，使日本成为美国在远东的兵工厂。该报说，中国抗战牺牲百万人命，非军事的损失估计在四百亿美元以上。在美国支配下决定拆迁的全部日本赔偿工厂价值不满二十亿美元，全给中国也不过赔偿我们人民损失不到二十分之一。但麦克阿瑟临时赔偿案只准搬迁百分之三十，中国名义上分得一半，国民党政府搬了三年还搬不到一千万美元。后来，美国对赔偿额一减再减。现在竟独断地宣布停止赔偿。这是中国人民所决不能同意的。社论指出：美英帝国主义违背波茨坦协定和莫斯科宣言的决定，硬抬出其绝对控制下的十一国会议来代替四国外长会议，企图操纵包办一切，其目的就在拖延和取消对日和约，让麦克阿瑟永作日本的陛下，奴役和驱使日本民族替美帝在远东作强盗，当炮灰。该报赞成最近巴黎四国外长会议上苏联代表维辛斯基重申的立场，即由苏中美英四国外长准备对日和约。社论最后宣称：日本问题的解决，“关系中国国运，关系远东人民的祸福，关系世界和平，更是日本民族命运之所系。对日有关各国和日本的人民力量应团结起来，坚决和美英帝国主义的对日政策斗争，并相信我们的斗争将获胜利。”
