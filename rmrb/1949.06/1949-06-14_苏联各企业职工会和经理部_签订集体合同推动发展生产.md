Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 13th: The system of trade unions and management departments of Soviet enterprises signing collective contracts and supervising the implementation of collective contracts plays a positive role in promoting production development. According to TASS Moscow: This year, trade unions in Soviet enterprises signed a total of 46,000 collective contracts with management departments, and 80 to 90 percent of workers and staff actively participated in meetings to discuss draft collective contracts. During the signing of collective contracts, trade unions conducted extensive political education, mobilized workers and staff to criticize shortcomings in production, and further promoted the socialist emulation movement to complete the annual plan and the Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule. At the meetings to discuss the draft collective contracts, workers and staff put forward a total of about one million suggestions, more than 71 percent of which have been accepted by the management departments and have been implemented.
    The Secretariat of the All-Union Central Council of Trade Unions recently instructed trade unions at all levels and trade union committees in enterprises (including factory committees and workshop committees) to organize mass and systematic supervision and inspection of the implementation of collective contracts, to regularly discuss the progress of the implementation of collective contracts, and to require the persons in charge of enterprises to unconditionally fulfill all obligations in the collective contracts within the prescribed time, and to pay special attention to obligations regarding housing, culture, and other construction.

  　签订集体合同推动发展生产
    【新华社北平十三日电】苏联各企业中的职工委员会和经理部签订集体合同，并监督执行集体合同的制度，对发展生产起着积极的推动作用。据塔斯社莫斯科讯：苏联各企业的职工委员会今年和经理部总共签订了四万六千个集体合同，百分之八十到九十的工人职员都积极参加了讨论集体合同草案的会议。在签订集体合同期间，职工会进行了广泛的政治教育，发动工人和职员批评生产中的缺点，把提前完成全年计划和五年计划的社会主义竞赛运动，更向前推进了一步。工人和职员们在讨论集体合同草案的会议上，提出了共约一百万个建议，这些建议百分之七十一以上都已被经理部门接受，并且已经实行。
    苏联职工会中央委员会书记处最近指示各级职工会和企业中的职工委员会（包括工厂委员会与车间委员会），对集体合同执行的情形，要组织群众性的有系统的监督和检查，要定期讨论集体合同执行的进展情形，要求企业的主管人在规定的时间内无条件地完成集体合同中的一切义务，并且要特别注意关于房屋、文化与其他建设的义务。
