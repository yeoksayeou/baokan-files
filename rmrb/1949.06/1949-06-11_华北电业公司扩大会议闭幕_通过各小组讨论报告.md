　　North China Electric Power Company
  　Enlarged Meeting Concludes
  　Approves Reports from Various Group Discussions
    [Special Dispatch] The North China Electric Power Company's enlarged meeting victoriously concluded yesterday (the 10th) after all proposals were unanimously approved. At yesterday's meeting, the business, engineering, management, and employee groups reported to the assembly on the discussion of proposals and opinions, which were then discussed and approved by the assembly. After the business group reported on the discussion of proposals such as revising business rules and handling electricity theft rules, the assembly discussed and supplemented them. Regarding the revision of business rules, the assembly believed that in addition to paying attention to the necessary procedures and connections within the company, the spirit of serving electricity users should be prioritized to strive for simplicity. Secondly, before implementing the "Draft Interim Regulations on Handling Electricity Theft," a period of publicity and education should be conducted to enable electricity thieves to correct their theft behavior, but those who repeatedly fail to do so must be given appropriate punishment. The meeting also discussed procedures for reporting electricity theft and reward methods. After the engineering group reported on the leadership issues of power plants, the meeting subsequently approved issues such as unified dispatch, equipment verification, division of labor between the general and branch companies in engineering, material allocation, the engineering department's annual plan, and intern training.
    Following this, the assembly approved the management group's report that the personnel regulations of the general and branch companies should be unified, and that the detailed rules of the branch companies should be formulated separately. After the employee group reported, regarding the relationship between the employee union and the administration, the assembly believed that both parties should maintain close contact. If the cooperation in the past was not good, each should make a review. The employee representatives of each branch company and power plant also unanimously stated, in order to guarantee the victorious completion of the Five-Year Plan, that they would lead all employees to complete the Five-Year Plan proposed by the assembly. The Tangshan employee representatives guaranteed to lead all employees to save coal, save electricity, and reduce costs. The Beijing branch company guaranteed to reduce machine operation failures, etc.
    Finally, Xu Dabian, Deputy Minister of the North China Enterprise Department, delivered the closing speech. After praising the spirit of unity between the administration and employees demonstrated at this meeting, Deputy Minister Xu pointed out that after this meeting, North China Electric Power could break away from the past state of each acting on its own and gradually embark on a path of developing undertakings with leadership, planning, and steps. The resolutions of this meeting will certainly achieve great results with everyone's efforts. Deputy Minister Xu emphasized that the full supply of electricity is first needed to develop industry, and therefore, he called on all employees to regard the work of the electric power industry not only as an economic task, but also as an urgent political task, and to continue to implement the spirit of unified leadership and unified management that was implemented at this meeting. Finally, Deputy Minister Xu pointed out that it is necessary to implement democratic management methods and mobilize the enthusiasm and creativity of employees in order to complete production tasks and plans.

　　华北电业公司
  　扩大会议闭幕
  　通过各小组讨论报告
    【本报特讯】华北电业公司扩大会议，在各项提案获得一致通过后，已于昨日（十日）胜利闭会。昨日会上由业务、工程、管理、职工四个小组分别向大会报告各小组讨论提案的情况及意见，然后由大会讨论通过。在业务组报告讨论重订营业规则及处理窃电规则等提案后，即由大会讨论补充，对于重订营业规则，大会认为除注意本公司内部必需手续及联系外，应以为用电户服务的精神，力求简便。其次实行“处理窃电规则暂行草案”之前，应进行一个时期的宣传教育，使窃电者自行改正其窃电行为，但对屡次不改者必须给以适当处罚。会上并讨论了检举窃电手续及奖励等办法。工程组报告发电所的领导问题后，随后通过统一调度问题，较验设备问题，以及总、分公司工程分工界限、材料分配、工程处本年度计划、实习员训练等问题。
    接着大会通过了管理组报告的总、分公司人事规章应当统一。各分公司办事细则应分别拟定等问题，职工小组报告后，对于职工会与行政关系，大会认为双方应取得密切联系。过去配合的不好，应各自做检讨。各分公司及各发电厂职工代表并为保证五年计划的胜利完成，一致表示：要带领全体职工，完成大会提出的五年计划，唐山职工代表保证带领全体职工节煤、节电减低成本。北平分公司保证减少机器运行故障等。
    最后，由华北企业部徐达本副部长致闭会词。徐副部长于赞扬这次会议表现了行政与职工的团结精神之后，指出：经这次会议后，华北电业就可以脱离过去各自为政的状态，逐渐走上有领导有计划有步骤的兴办事业。这次会议的决议，在大家努力下，也一定能取得巨大的成绩。徐副部长于此着重指出，开展工业就首先需要电力的充分供应，因此，号召全体职工，对电业这一工作，不但看做是经济任务，且应当看做是一个紧急的政治任务。并把此次会议所贯彻了的统一领导、统一经营的精神继续贯彻下去。最后，徐副部长指出必须实行民主的管理方法，发动职工的积极性、创造性，才能完成生产任务与计划。
