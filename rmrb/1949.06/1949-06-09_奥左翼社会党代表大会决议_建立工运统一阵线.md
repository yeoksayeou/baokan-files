Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 8th: TASS Vienna Dispatch: The first congress of the Austrian Left Socialist Party was held in Vienna on the 4th and 5th. Representatives from various provinces of Austria and foreign socialist parties attended. At the meeting on the 4th, Basu, one of the leaders of the Italian Socialist Party, addressed the congress, explaining the united struggle of the Italian Socialist Party and the Communist Party, and pointed out that the fighting unity of the working people is a guarantee of victory.

The leader of the Austrian Left Socialist Party, Schärf, made a report on "The Current Situation and the Tasks of the Left Socialist Party," strongly criticizing the Austrian Socialist Party's right-wing leadership group for betraying the working class, and called on uniting all true socialist forces to carry out the struggle against reactionary forces.

The congress held a closed meeting on the 5th, listened to and discussed the report by Mandler, the representative of Salzburg: "The Principles of Our Struggle." Subsequently, the congress adopted a resolution on political issues, pointing out the growth of the Left Socialist Party's power in Austria. The resolution stated that in its future activities, the Left Socialist Party will strive to establish a united front of the entire Austrian labor movement to oppose capitalist reaction.

The congress supported the demand of the employees of the Albin-Donawitz factory, expressed in their resolution, for "reducing prices and increasing wages." It also fully approved their proposal to "establish a united front to realize these demands."

The meeting also approved the resolution passed by the Left Socialist Party's March meeting on electing candidates for members of parliament of the Left Socialist Party. For this purpose, a special committee of the Left Socialist Party was established to be responsible for resolving all technical issues of the election campaign. According to this resolution, the meeting elected a committee composed of thirty people. The meeting also decided to nominate Schärf as the first candidate for member of parliament in all constituencies of Austria.

Another resolution of the congress expressed anger at the Presidium of the Austrian Trade Union Federation for refusing to participate in the Second World Trade Union Congress to be held in Milan. The resolution protested the attempt of the Austrian Socialist Party's right-wing leaders to help split the world labor movement.
