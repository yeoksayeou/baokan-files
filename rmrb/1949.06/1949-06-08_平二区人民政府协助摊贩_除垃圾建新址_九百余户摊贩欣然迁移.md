　　[This Newspaper News] Today (the 8th), 910 vendors from Xidan North Street to Xuanwumen area in Ping City will begin to move to the new Xihuangchenggen Market, and more than 700 households will move to Nangouyan (Tonglinge Road) to continue their business. In addition, more than 200 households of vegetable and meat vendors will move to Shuncheng Street in Xuannei. In order to relocate the vendors, the Second District Government conducted in-depth mobilization and explanation, humbly listened to the opinions of the vendors, and organized them according to the original order. In order to take care of the vendors' business, the District Government used great efforts to reorganize the new market in Xihuangchenggen: First, it thoroughly cleared nearly 100 tons of garbage accumulated at the south entrance of the street, and the Municipal Construction Bureau sent an engineering team to build and flatten the site, paving it with coke, and building toilets. The water company and the power branch company installed street lights and running water respectively. In order to enable the new market to quickly restore prosperity, the District Government erected colorful arches at the north and south entrances of the new market. It also mobilized students in the district to perform recreational programs on the streets during their spare time, and invited the People's Broadcasting Station to publicize widely to attract customers. The vendors are very grateful to the People's Government for helping them solve their difficulties with such a serious and responsible attitude. They all said, "In the Kuomintang era, we would have been driven away with whips long ago, who would care about us!" Therefore, they consciously organized themselves to implement the government's policy of reorganizing vendors, and assisted the government in exposing special agents.

　　平二区人民政府协助摊贩　除垃圾建新址
  　九百余户摊贩欣然迁移
    【本报讯】平市西单北大街至宣武门一带的摊贩，今日（八日）将有九百一十户开始迁至西皇城根新市场，七百多户迁至南沟沿（佟麟阁路），继续营业，另有二百多户的菜贩和肉贩将迁至宣内顺城街去。二区政府为了迁移摊贩，曾进行深入的动员解释，虚心听取摊贩们的意见，按原有的秩序来编组。为了照顾摊贩们的买卖，区政府曾经用极大的力量整理西皇城根的新市场：首先彻底清除了堆积在该街南口近百吨的垃圾，市府建设局又派工程队来修筑与压平场子，铺上煤焦，并修建厕所。自来水公司，电力分公司都分别装上路灯和自来水。为使新市场能迅速恢复繁荣，区政府在新市场的南北口都搭上鲜艳的彩牌。并动员该区学生利用课余时间，在街头表演游艺节目，又请人民广播电台广泛宣传，以广招徕顾客。摊贩们对于人民政府以如此认真负责的态度来帮助自己解决困难，非常感激。都说：“国民党时代，早一顿皮带把我们抽跑了，谁还管我们啊！”因此都自觉地组织起来，执行政府的整理摊贩方针。并协助政府检举特务分子。
