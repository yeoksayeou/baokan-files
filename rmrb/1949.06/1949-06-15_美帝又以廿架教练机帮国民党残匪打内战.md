　　Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 14th. American imperialism is continuing to aid the remaining Kuomintang bandit gangs in carrying out the civil war. According to an Associated Press dispatch from Wichita, Kansas, on the 12th: The American Beechcraft Corporation has handed over twenty D-18 twin-engine military trainer aircraft manufactured by the company to the Kuomintang to help the Kuomintang bandit gangs continue to train air force personnel and slaughter the Chinese people. One of them has been shipped to the Pacific coast, where it will be packed and shipped to the Taiwan Bandit Central Aviation School. Chennault's air force is stepping up its aggression against southwestern China. The air force has added air routes at the beginning of this month, starting from Chongqing to Guangzhou, Lanzhou, Chengdu, Guiyang, Kunming, Xiamen and other places, with Hanzhong, Guilin, Liuzhou, and Hengyang as intermediate stops. According to an Associated Press report, Admiral Badger, commander of the U.S. Western Pacific Fleet, claimed in Tokyo on the 10th that the U.S. fleet would continue to use the Chinese coast as a base, and revealed that Xiamen and Dapeng Bay in Guangdong might be used as bases. In other news: Gan, a bandit from Gansu, is continuing his activities in the United States. On the 9th, he met with U.S. Acting Secretary of State Webb to ask the United States to help the Kuomintang bandit gangs establish a so-called "defense line" in the southwest. Gan also met with Chennault. War criminal Chen Cheng also gave a speech to American reporters on the 10th, asking the United States to assist the Kuomintang remnants in Taiwan in their death throes.
