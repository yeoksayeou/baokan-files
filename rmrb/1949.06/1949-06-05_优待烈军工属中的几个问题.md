    Question:

    II. Can the children of poor revolutionary martyr, military personnel, and worker families residing in cities request free education at public and private schools? If so, what procedures must be followed? To which level of authority should they apply?
    III. If a married female cadre lives in a city, should preferential treatment for her family be given to her parents' home or her husband's home?
    IV. Before the liberation of Beiping, children from a family went to the liberated areas to participate in the revolution, but their detailed addresses and work departments are unknown. Now that Beiping is liberated, contact is still impossible. Can they obtain military family status? What should be done?

    Answer:
    I. If a household has a young adult participating in the People's Liberation Army and another brother participating in the Kuomintang reactionary army, priority should be given to caring for the family of the soldier participating in the People's Liberation Army. Their direct relatives should be given preferential treatment as military families. While enjoying this glorious preferential treatment and love from the masses, and in light of the current nationwide victory, they should also write to their other son, who was deceived or captured and forced to join the reactionary army, urging him to return as soon as possible and escape the pit of disaster.
    II. Impoverished children of revolutionary martyrs and military families residing in cities have priority in enjoying public funding when enrolling in public schools under the same conditions as the general population. Children of worker families also have priority in enjoying public funding under the same conditions as the general population, but military families should be prioritized over worker families. Those with certificates for families of revolutionary martyrs, military personnel, or workers can apply directly to the school. Those without certificates can obtain a certificate from the district government through an introduction from the People's Street Government.
    III. For married female cadres, the preferential treatment for their family should be enjoyed by either their parents' home or their husband's home, according to the female cadre's own choice.
    IV. Military families must hold certificates from the military personnel's unit at or above the regimental level, and worker families must hold certificates from the work unit of the worker to enjoy preferential treatment. However, if proof cannot be obtained immediately due to the unit being far away or for special reasons, and if comrades or organizations in Beiping can provide definitive proof, their families may be temporarily regarded as military or worker families. If there is no proof and no witnesses, but it is believed that the family's account of their children joining the army or work is accurate, and relatives or neighbors can testify and the investigation confirms it, they may be temporarily treated as military or worker families after approval from the district people's government.

　　优待烈军工属中的几个问题
    问：
    一、在北平往往有这样的情形；一户有两个青壮年参加两种不同的军队，大哥参加解放军，其弟则参加国民党反动派的军队，那么，这一户是否可取得军属地位？
    二、家居城市的贫苦烈、军、工属的子弟，是否可以要求免费到公私立学校念书？可以的话，必须经过那些手续？向何级机关申请？
    三、家居城市已经结婚的女干部，其家属优待应归娘家呢？还是归婆家？
    四、在北平未解放前，家里的子女便赴解放区参加革命，但不明了其详细地址及工作部门，现在北平解放了，仍无法联系，试问，这样是否能取得军属地位？该如何办？
    　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　刘春效、王守兴、黑七等
    答：
    一、一户有青壮年参加人民解放军，另有弟兄参加国民党反动军队者，应尽先照顾参加解放军的军人，其直系亲属，应当予以军属优待，其家属在享得群众此种光荣优待及热爱后，同时在当前全国胜利的形势下，应对其被骗走抓走而参加反动军队的另一子弟，写信叫回，早日脱离祸坑。
    二、家居城市的贫苦烈、军属子弟在与群众同等条件下到公立学校就学时，有享受公费待遇之优先权，工属与群众同等条件下亦同样有享受公费待遇之优先权，但与军属同等条件下应先尽军属。以上只要持有烈、军、工属证照，直接向学校申请即可。无证照者，可由人民街政府介绍到当地区政府开具证明。
    三、已经结婚的女干部，其家属优待应由该女干部自愿选择一方享受优待。
    四、军属须持有军人所在部队团级以上机关的证明文件，工属须持有工作人员所在机关之证明文件，始得享受优待，但因部队远离或因特殊原故未能即时取得证明者，如有我来平同志或在平机关团体确切证明者，其家属得暂视为军属或工属，既无证明文件又无人证，但认为其家属所谈子弟参军或参加工作之过程确凿，且有亲友或邻居作证经考察属实者，经区人民政府批准后得暂按军属或工属优待。
