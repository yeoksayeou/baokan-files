　　Closely Link the Party with the Masses!
  　The Ping Telecommunications Bureau Officially Publicizes Party Branches in Fourteen Units
　　[Our Newspaper's Report] In order to make the Party the core leading fortress among the masses, and to more closely link the Party with the masses, not only to realize the Party's leadership over the masses, but also to realize the masses' supervision of the Party, the Beiping Telecommunications Bureau, after two months of deliberation and preparation, on June 23rd, announced the list of Communist Party branch secretaries and nine members of the general branch in fourteen units to the masses, and made the Party branches public. Making the Party public was proposed on April 27th among all Party members, calling on each Party member to fully recognize the importance of making the Party public, to study according to the Party Constitution, and requiring Party members to examine their own thoughts, actions, and how to prepare. Since then, this issue has been discussed at every Party member meeting, emphasizing that the current Chinese Communist Party has become a nationwide, mass-based party. In order to make the Party more closely linked to the masses and become a strong leading core for leading the masses, so as to better enable the masses to supervise Party members and widely listen to the opinions of the masses, it is necessary to make the Party public. At the same time, explanations were given to address the ideological concerns of Party members about making the Party public. Some Party members believed that they had many shortcomings and phenomena of being detached from the masses, and that making the Party public would damage the Party's prestige. Some were afraid that after the Party was made public, the masses would raise questions to them in work and study, and they would not be able to answer them. The general branch pointed out that during the enemy's rule, it was necessary to strictly keep the Party's secrets in order to protect the Party's organization from being destroyed by the enemy. However, keeping secrets was not against the masses but against the enemy. Our Party members did a lot of work for the Party and the people during the enemy's rule, but this should not become an ideological burden. If there are shortcomings or mistakes, we must honestly make self-criticism among the masses.
　　In addition, deliberation and mobilization were also carried out among the masses. On May 30th, after the mobilization meeting for the establishment of the Enterprise Management Committee, the general branch secretary, Comrade Zhang Jirong, was made public. The significance of the Enterprise Management Committee was explained at the mass meeting of each bureau. At the same time, the matter of making the Party public was raised, and it was pointed out that the vast majority of Communist Party members are advanced fighters of the proletariat and loyal servants of the people. However, they are not as perfect as everyone imagines. It is not surprising that Party members themselves have shortcomings, and even individual Party members are not as progressive as activists among the masses. This requires everyone to criticize them so that they can make progress faster.
　　At the Party member meeting on June 18th, the specific steps for making the Party public were announced: (1) First, publicize the branch secretaries of each branch and the members of the general branch. (2) Openly convene Party member meetings of each branch, and welcome the masses to participate. (3) On June 30th, all Party members will be made public, and new Party members will hold an admission ceremony.
　　Editor's Note: Making the Party branch public is completely necessary, but in terms of work steps, it should be made public all at once after deliberation, and there is no need to divide it into several stages.

　　密切党与群众联系！
  　平电信局十四单位　党的支部正式公开
    【本报讯】为使党在群众中成为领导的核心堡垒，更加密切党与群众的联系，不仅实现党对于群众的领导，而且实现群众对于党的监督，北平电信局经过二个月的酝酿与准备，已于六月二十三日将十四个单位的共产党支部书记及总支九个委员名单公布到群众中，并公开了党的支部。公开党是四月二十七日在全体党员中提出，曾号召每个党员充分认识公开党的重要性，按照党章进行学习，要求党员检查自己的思想、行动以及怎样来做准备。从此后每次的党员大会上都讲这个问题，并着重指出：现在的中国共产党，已成为全国性的群众性的大党，为了使党更加密切的联系群众，成为领导群众强有力的核心，以便更好的使群众监督党员，广泛听取群众意见，必需使党公开。同时针对着党员对公开党的思想顾虑加以解释。有些党员认为：自己有很多缺点，有脱离群众的现象，公开后有损党的威信。有的怕公开后群众在工作中学习中向自己提出问题，答不上来。总支指出：敌人统治时期，为了保全党的组织不被敌人破坏，必需严守党的秘密，但是，保守秘密不是对群众而是对敌人；我们党员在敌人统治时期为党为人民作了很多工作，但不能在思想上成为包袱，有缺点、有错误要老老实实在群众中作检讨。
    另外，在群众中也作了酝酿动员。于五月三十日在成立企业管理委员会的动员大会后，将总支部书记张季荣同志公开，并在各局群众大会上讲解企业管理委员会的意义，同时提出了公开党的事情，并指出：共产党党员绝大多数是无产阶级的先进战士，是人民忠诚的勤务员，但是，也不是大家所想象的那样十全十美。党员本身有缺点，甚至个别党员还不如群众中积极分子进步，这也是不足惊奇的，这就要求大家进行批评，使他们更快的进步。
    六月十八日党员大会上宣布了公开党的具体步骤：（一）首先公开各支部的支部书记、总支委员。（二）公开召开各支部的党员大会，欢迎群众参加。（三）六月三十日将全体党员公开，新党员举行入党仪式。
    编者按：党的支部的公开是完全必要的，但在工作步骤上应该是在酝酿成后一次公开，不必分成几个阶段。
