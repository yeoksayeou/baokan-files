The preparatory committee of the Central Plains Federation of Trade Unions recently mobilized over 700 cadres to form work teams, which will be dispatched to railway, postal and telecommunications, and textile enterprises in Wuhan to carry out labor movement work. The first batch of seven teams, consisting of over 50 people, has already set off, and the rest will depart soon. The tasks of the work teams are to publicize the Communist Party's urban policies, strive for the rapid resumption of work and production in various factories, and resolve and guarantee the livelihoods of workers. The work teams will closely cooperate with the takeover work, go deep among the workers, understand the situation, and mobilize the workers to assist in the takeover, in order to facilitate the early resumption of production.
