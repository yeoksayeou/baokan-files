Xinhua News Agency, Peiping, 17th: TASS, New York, 15th: American business figures are generally worried about the current economic situation in the United States. Rudick, editor of the Commercial Daily, recently published his observations from a trip to the East, stating that in the minds of most businessmen, the downward economic trend is beyond doubt. Rudick said: "Perhaps there are still optimists, but at least we didn't find one on our trip. According to the Federal Reserve's current estimates, the industrial production index at the end of 1949 (based on 1935-1939 as 100) will hover between 175 and 150. However, according to our own projections, it will be between 165 and 160. Last year's peak was 195." Henry, a professor of economics at New York University, pointed out in the "New York American Daily" that "Even the most extreme optimists admit that there is currently a periodic economic recession." "U.S. News & World Report" magazine stated: "Except for the automobile industry, all other industrial production is either declining or trending downward." Reason, vice president of a banking trust company controlled by the Morgan Group, recently expressed his opinion that industrial production may fall by 16 to 20 percent from the so-called post-war peak. Speaking at a Federal Reserve Bank conference in Minneapolis on May 10, he said: "In these few weeks, business trends have shown a downward state. Obviously, the post-war prosperity ended in the second half of 1948, and the industrial productivity in the past six months has been declining continuously. I believe this downward trend will continue." Sloan, chairman of the board of General Motors, holds the same view, predicting that the U.S. economy will decline further, believing that the U.S. economy is declining at a relatively "moderate" speed. Allen, the author of "World Monopoly Capital and Peace," expressed the following opinion: "I estimate that the periodic economic crisis of overproduction began in the autumn of 1948, and the crisis has been continuing at a rather slow but constant pace for the past six months. Preparing for war has prolonged the cycle of economic crisis, but without a doubt, the crisis will develop in various economic sectors and produce imbalanced consequences in all sectors. Moreover, there is currently no way to stop the economic decline and prevent it from reaching a serious level."

　　面临周期性经济危机
  　美企业界都在害怕
    商务日报说找不到一个“乐观论者”
    【新华社北平十七日电】塔斯社纽约十五日电：美国企业界人士对美国目前的经济状况咸表忧虑。商务日报编辑鲁迪克顷发表最近他在东部旅行的观感称，在一般企业家的心目中，经济下降的趋势已经是无庸置疑的了。鲁迪克称：“也许还有乐观论者，但是，至少在我们的旅行中，没有找到一个乐观论者。依照联邦准备局目前的估计，一九四九年底的工业生产指数（按系以一九三五至一九三九年为一○○），将徘徊于一七五——一五○之间。但是，依照我们自己的推测，将在一六五——一六○之间。而去年的最高峰为一九五。”纽约大学经济学教授亨利在“纽约美国人日报”上指出：“甚至极端的乐观论者，也承认目前有着周期性经济衰退的事实。”“美国新闻与世界报道”杂志称：“除了汽车工业以外，其他一切的工业生产不是已经下降，便是趋于下降。”摩根集团控制下的银行业信托公司的副总裁雷埃森，最近也发表意见称：工业生产可能比所谓战后最高峰下降百分之十六至百分之二十。五月十日，他在明尼阿波利斯的联邦准备银行会议上发言称：“在这几个星期内，商业动向呈现下降状态。很明显的，战后繁荣在一九四八年后半年已告终止，而过去六个月的工业生产率，又是不断地下降。我相信，这种下降的趋势是要继续下去的。”通用汽车公司董事会主席斯隆持有同样的意见，他预测美国经济将更趋下降，相信美国经济是以比较“缓和”的速度下降。“世界垄断资本与和平”一书的作者爱伦，表示下列意见：“我估计，周期性的生产过剩的经济危机，是在一九四八年秋季开始的，过去六个月来，危机是以颇为缓慢但是不停的步调在继续进行。准备战争使经济危机的周期延长了，但是，毫无疑问地，危机将在各个经济部门中发展起来，并在各部门中产生不平衡的恶果。而且，现在还没有什么办法可以阻止经济下降，使它不致到达严重的程度。”
