　　Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, 16th -- Since the Northeast lifted the ban on private merchants transporting grain into customs, Tianjin's grain supply has become increasingly abundant. From the 1st to the 12th of this month, private merchants transported over 85 million jin of coarse and fine grains to Tianjin from the Northeast. In addition, recently, over 15 million jin of grain were transported to Tianjin from Xuzhou, Jinan, Dezhou and other places.
