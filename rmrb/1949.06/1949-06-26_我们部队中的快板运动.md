　　The Quick Clapper Exercise in Our Troops
　　Sixth Army Eighteenth Corps Ge Fei
　　Quick clapper is very popular in our troops. It is not only active in training and marching, but also in the extremely tense combat life. Quick clapper is even more active. In the trenches, you can see new trench leaflets almost every day. When you enter the trenches, you can see quick clappers written by soldiers everywhere, some describing the trench life, and some describing the role of the trenches. For example: "My home is a cave dwelling, and there is a trench outside the door. The enemy's bullets can't hit it, which makes his grenade launcher angry." "The cave is not wide or big, sitting inside to talk. Reading the leaflets and good news, telling stories and jokes." Such quick clappers are not only liked by the vast number of soldiers to write and say, but also illiterate people say it themselves and ask others to help write it. Some division political commissars, regimental political commissars, division commanders, regimental commanders and other cadres also like to write and read quick clappers, using the quick clapper form that the masses like to hear and see to educate and encourage the troops and spread good experiences. Needless to say, these cadres are also particularly concerned about and supporting the quick clapper movement.
　　Various work activities in the troops are often expressed and reflected in the form of quick clappers. Use quick clappers to write challenge letters, response letters, letters of request for battle, meritorious service plans, and mutual aid contracts; use quick clappers to summarize experiences, review lessons, commend models, and criticize shortcomings; use quick clappers to complain, and use quick clappers to expose the enemy's crimes. Use quick clappers to spread good news, and use quick clappers to put forward mobilization and encouragement slogans... In short, quick clapper timely and flexibly cooperated with various tasks in the troops and played an educational and encouraging role, and enlivened the troops' morale.
　　The first characteristic of the quick clapper activity in our troops is its mass character. The quick clapper, as an artistic form, is very short and concise. It is not only easy for readers to accept, but also relatively easy for authors to master. Therefore, the vast number of cadres and soldiers are readers and also authors. They live in an earth-shaking and fiery struggle all day long, and have very rich experience in struggle. In this way, quick clapper has an inexhaustible source of life. For example, after the liberation of Yan'an, combat hero Zhang Gengwu's class gave Chiang Kai-shek a small receipt in quick clapper:
　　Chiang Kai-shek, American-made, relies on your godfather to support your waist.
　　Relying on the American Truman, he made guns and cannons for you.
　　You became a transportation team, sending guns and cannons to the People's Liberation Army.
　　……………
　　Let's just say our seventh class, fought five battles in a year.
　　Received your personnel, guns and cannons, and gave you a small receipt.
　　Now received, now received, a small 60 mortar.
　　Two and a half light and heavy machine guns, and forty-two rifles.
　　There are also three submachine guns, some not made in America.
　　Five complete telephone sets, brand new and clever.
　　Received ninety-five prisoners, some of whom are too young.
　　……………
　　This small quick clapper was warmly welcomed by the vast number of soldiers. Many soldiers memorized it thoroughly and often said it, which played a great role in encouraging our army's morale and destroying the enemy's prestige. At that time, it also received material rewards from the newspaper. Why is this small quick clapper written so vividly? The most important reason is that the author personally experienced rich struggles, and naturally there will be rich emotions revealed. The second characteristic of quick clapper is its combativeness and sharpness. It can serve the war and the soldiers in a timely manner, and play a considerable role in promoting work and guiding the struggle. Many quick clappers are written and spread quickly, and immediately take effect. For example, before the ×× city landing battle, the leaders mobilized the assault team, and compiled trench leaflets based on the leaders' speeches while holding the meeting. One of them was written like this: "The assault team is like a steel nail. Nailed at the breakthrough, it is more stable than Mount Tai. The assault team is like a awl. Inserted into the enemy's heart, drill straight in. Take another step to nail a nail. No retreat, only advance, stick in an awl and smell the blood. Eat a ton of meat happily, eliminate the Chiang Kai-shek and Yan bandit gang, and determine to make great contributions." This leaflet vividly expressed the leaders' requirements for the assault team. It spread throughout the division immediately and played a significant role in encouraging the charging soldiers.
　　Why does quick clapper play a particularly large role in education and encouragement in our troops?
　　One: Because it is very closely integrated with the central work. For example, when the leadership advocates the insertion and cutting off of the bayonet tactics, a quick clapper of "Boldness Leads to Great Victory" was written: "Boldness leads to great victory, bravely insert inward, insert into the enemy's depth, and bloom in the belly. Cut off the retreat, the enemy is divided. Tightly surrounded on all sides, not letting one escape. Hit hard, thoroughly and radically. Attack with preparation, and quickly with planning. Eat piece by piece, break through one by one. Agile and tenacious, fiercely attack and shout. Good fire cover, individual soldiers go to blast. Small teams quickly assault and capture prisoners." This quick clapper played a considerable role in implementing the leadership's tactical thinking.
　　On the other hand, what are the concerns (problems) of the masses in completing the tasks given by the leaders? Which concern is the main one? Which advanced elements have already solved it, and what methods did they use to solve it? Write these methods into quick clappers to help and inspire everyone to dispel their concerns. For example: before the liberation of Taiyuan, everyone had concerns about the cement bunkers, so they wrote "How to Attack Cement Bunkers" and "Self-Introduction of Cement Bunkers"; when everyone had concerns about fighting in depth, they wrote "How to Fight in Depth?" (These were all written from the summary of the masses' experience); when everyone had concerns about the three bombs (illumination bombs, incendiary bombs, bombs), they wrote leaflets such as "Take Advantage of the Light to See the Terrain" based on the three-bomb education summary: "Illumination bombs are useless. The outside is an iron bucket. There are two ways to use it. It's also very ordinary. One is to use a cannon to fire, and the other is to be thrown by an airplane. When fired, it's like a lamp, swaying and sinking. Don't panic, don't move, take advantage of the light to see the terrain. Wait until it goes out, then move forward." This quick clapper not only dispelled the ideological concerns about the illumination bombs, but also learned to use the illumination bombs, thus turning the enemy's advantages into our advantages. There is one point that needs to be made clear here. The two aspects of the leadership and the masses mentioned earlier are combined and consistent, and cannot be separated. The quick clapper is written based on the leadership's intentions and the masses' experience, and it is not simply a copy, but a creative one.
　　Two: Quick clapper is combined with culture and entertainment. Even if the quick clapper is well compiled, some comrades are illiterate and cannot accept it if no one reads it to them. Therefore, once the quick clapper is sent to the company, the cultural cadre, entertainment committee member, and study group leaders of each class will use various opportunities to perform it for everyone. The leaders also organize and urge this work. During game time, everyone automatically welcomes each other to say quick clapper.
　　Three: Quick clapper is combined with learning culture. Some soldiers feel that quick clapper is very good, but they are illiterate and cannot read it directly, which is very anxious. They learn quick clapper and learn literacy at the same time. Gradually, more and more people can read quick clapper directly.
　　Four: Quick clapper is combined with cartoons. People who can't write can draw cartoons, and those who can't understand quick clapper can read the pictures, which is more popular with soldiers.
　　In the quick clapper movement, some good works have indeed been produced. The masses' response to good quick clappers can be summarized in these four sentences: "It's energetic, smooth, easy to understand, easy to remember, and interesting. It introduces methods and encourages, and the content is specific and practical." These four sentences are the masses' praise for quick clapper, and also the masses' requirements for quick clapper. Its meaning needs to be explained further. "It's energetic and smooth" means that the rhyme is natural and smooth, not forced, clean and not procrastinating. Get straight to the point, don't beat around the bush, don't wear big hats, don't drag long tails. "Easy to understand, easy to remember, and interesting" means that the quick clapper is about the soldiers' own affairs, speaking the soldiers' language, with sour, sweet, bitter, and spicy flavors, not boring. "Introduce methods and encourage, and the content is specific and practical" means that the quick clapper can timely introduce methods to solve current problems, or commend and encourage models, and these are precisely what everyone urgently needs in the struggle. Therefore, some soldiers reflected: "The quick clapper is really wonderful! When we are worried about what problems and have no way to solve them, the quick clapper comes, and the method to solve this problem is right above. It's really like a key to open our minds."
　　Of course, this is not to say that quick clapper is perfect and has no shortcomings. Shortcomings do exist. Old-fashioned problems that do not proceed from specific reality are often discovered. This must be overcome in order to improve the quick clapper movement a step further.

　　我们部队中的快板运动
    第六十军十八兵团  革飞
    快板，在我们部队中非常普遍流行，不但在练兵中行军中快板很活跃，并且在极度紧张的战斗生活中，快板更是活跃，在战壕里几乎天天可以看到新的战壕传单。你走进战壕，到处可以看到战士写的快板，有的是描写战壕生活的，有的是形容战壕的作用的。比如：“我的家是土窑窑，出门就是一道壕。敌人子弹打不着，气坏他的榴弹炮。”“窑洞不宽不大，坐在里边谈话。看的传单捷报，说的故事笑话。”象这样的快板，不但广大战士喜欢写喜欢说，不识字的自己说，请人帮助写，有些师政委、团政委、师长、团长等干部都喜欢写快板读快板，用群众喜闻乐见的快板形式去教育鼓动部队，传播好的经验。不消说这些干部也是特别关心与扶植快板运动的。
    部队中的各种工作活动，很多是用快板形式表达与反映出来的。用快板写挑战书，应战书，请战书，立功计划，互助合同；用快板总结经验，检讨教训，表扬模范，批评缺点；用快板诉苦，用快板揭露敌人的罪行。用快板传捷报，用快板提动员鼓动口号……总之，快板及时地灵活地配合了部队中各种工作并起了教育鼓动作用，又活跃了部队情绪。
    我们部队中的快板活动，第一个特点是它的群众性。快板这一文艺形式，非常短小精干，不但读者容易接受，并且作者比较容易掌握，因此，广大的干部战士是读者，同时又都是作者。他们都是整天价生活在翻天覆地火热的斗争中，斗争经验非常丰富。这样，快板便有了取之不尽用之不竭的生活源泉。比如在光复延安以后，战斗英雄张庚午班用快板给蒋介石打了个小收条：
    蒋介石，美国造，靠你干爹撑后腰。
    凭上美国杜鲁门，给你造枪又造炮。
    你们当上运输队，给解放军送枪炮。
    ……………
    光说我们第七班，一年作了五次战。
    收到你的人枪炮，给你打个小收条。
    今收到，今收到，一门小小六零炮。
    轻重机枪两挺半，步枪四十又两条。
    还有三支冲锋枪，有的不是美国造。
    电话机子整五部，崭崭新新又灵巧。
    收到俘虏九十五，有些年纪还太小。
    ……………
    这个小快板受到了广大士兵的热烈欢迎。很多战士把它背的烂熟，经常挂在嘴上，对鼓励我军士气，灭敌人的威风，起了很大作用。当时还受到了报社的物质奖励。为什么这个小快板写得这样生动活泼呢？最主要原因是作者亲身经历了丰富的斗争，自然就会有丰富的感情流露出来。快板的第二个特点是它的战斗性与尖锐性。它能及时的为战争服务，为兵服务。并起着相当的推动工作指导斗争的作用。有许多快板都是迅速的写出，迅速的传播，便马上发生效力。比如在××登城战斗前，首长动员突击队，边开会边根据首长的讲话编出了战壕传单。其中一个是这样写的：“突击队，象钢钉。钉在突破口，赛过泰山稳。突击队，象锥尖。插进敌心脏，一直往里钻。进一步钉个钉，没有后退只前进，扎一锥闻见腥，见肉美美吃一吨，消灭蒋阎匪，决心立大功。”这个传单把首长对突击队的要求很生动的表现出来了。马上传遍了全师，对冲锋的战士起了不小鼓舞作用。
    快板，为什么在我们部队中起的教育鼓动作用特别大呢？
    一：因为它非常紧密的结合了中心工作。比如当领导上提倡插入切断的尖刀战术时，便写了个“胆大胜利大”的快板：“胆大胜利大，勇猛往里插，插入敌纵深，腹内来开花。后路给切断，敌人被分割。四面包围紧，不让跑一个。狠狠用力打，彻底连根扒。攻击有准备，迅速有计划。一块一块吃，各个来击破。敏捷又顽强，猛打加喊话。火力掩护好，单兵去爆炸。小组猛突击，就把俘虏抓。”这个快板对贯彻领导的战术思想是起了相当作用的。
    另一方面，群众在完成领导上所给予的任务中，有些什么顾虑（问题）？那个顾虑是主要的？那些先进份子已经解决了，用什么方法解决的？就把这些方法写成快板，帮助与启发大家解除顾虑。比如：在解放太原前，大家对洋灰碉有顾虑，就写“怎样打洋灰碉”、“洋灰碉的自我介绍”；在大家对打纵深有顾虑时，就写“怎样打纵深？”（这些都是从总结群众经验中写的）；在大家对三弹有顾虑时（照明弹，燃烧弹，炸弹）就根据三弹教育总结写出了“趁明看地形”等传单：“照明弹，没啥用，外面是洋铁桶，它的用法有两种，说来到也很普通。一种是用炮来打，一种是用飞机扔。打出来，象盏灯，悠悠荡荡往下沉。不要慌，不要动，趁着明明看地形。等它熄灭了，你再向前进。”这个快板不但解除了对照明弹的思想顾虑，并且学会了利用照明弹，这样一来便把敌人的优点变成了我们的优点了。这里有一点特别应交代清楚，前边说领导与群众两方面是结合的，一致的，不能分裂开看。所说根据领导意图，群众经验写快板，也并不单纯是翻板，而是有创造的。
    二、快板与文化娱乐结合。快板即便编的好，由于有些同志不识字，没人念给听还是接受不了。因此，快板一发到连队，就由文化干事，文娱委员，各班学习小组长，利用各种机会给大家表说。领导上也对这一工作有组织的进行督促。到游戏时候，大家自动的互相欢迎说快板。
    三、快板和学文化结合，有些战士觉得快板很好，就是自己不识字不能直接看，怪着急，便一边学快板一边学识字，慢慢直接看快板的人也就多起来了。
    四、快板和漫画结合，不会写字的人能画漫画，看不懂快板的能看画，更受战士欢迎。
    在快板运动中，的确产生了一些较好的作品。群众对好快板的反映，综合起来有这样四句话：“又格劲，又顺嘴，好懂好记有趣味。介绍方法和鼓励，内容具体又实际。”这四句话是群众对快板的赞美，也是群众对快板的要求。它的意思需要再解释一下，“又格劲，又顺嘴，”就是说韵脚押的自然、顺当，不是强拉硬凑，干净利落不拖泥带水。开门见山，劈头就上正题，不转弯抹角，不戴大帽子，不拖长尾巴。“好懂好记有趣味。”就是说快板是写的兵自己的事情，说的兵言兵语，有酸有甜有苦有辣，不是枯燥无味。“介绍方法又鼓励，内容具体又实际。”就是说快板能及时地介绍解决当前问题的方法，或者是表扬鼓励模范，而这些都正是大家在斗争中迫切需要的。所以有的战士这样反映说：“快板来的真妙！咱对什么问题正发愁没办法解决的时候，快板就来了，上边正好是解决这个问题的方法。真跟开脑筋钥匙一样。”
    当然，这并不是说：快板就十全十美没有缺点，缺点是有的，不从具体实际出发的老一套等毛病还常常发现，这必须克服了它才能把快板运动提高一步。
