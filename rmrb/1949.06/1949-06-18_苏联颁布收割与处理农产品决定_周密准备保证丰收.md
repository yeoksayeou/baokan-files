　　Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 17th: TASS reports: The Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union and the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union issued a decision on the 14th, stipulating a detailed program for harvesting and processing agricultural products this year.

　　The decision first summarized the achievements of spring planting in the Soviet Union this year, saying: Spring planting this year was organized better than last year. Collective farms, machine and tractor stations, and state farms completed the planting work in a shorter period of time, and the quality of work was better than before, thus ensuring the maximum increase in the production of grain, industrial crops, and other crops. Spring wheat and industrial crops were largely sown with selected seeds on fallow land and land that was plowed last autumn, and according to the state plan, the sown area of ​​major industrial crops such as cotton, flax, hemp, sugar beets, and sunflowers, as well as spring wheat, winter wheat, rye, and cereals, was expanded. In order to fulfill the task of fully supplying feed as stipulated in the three-year plan for the development of livestock breeding, the sown area of ​​perennial and annual pastures has nearly doubled, and the sown area of ​​feed, root crops, and silage has also increased by half. At the same time, plans for planting forest shelterbelts and establishing nurseries have also been greatly exceeded.

　　The decision then stipulated the current main tasks for the Soviet Ministry of Agriculture, the Soviet Ministry of State Farms, Party organizations, Soviet organizations, agricultural organs, collective farms, machine and tractor stations, and state farms: to organize timely and thorough weeding of all crops; to conduct thorough preparation for harvesting and processing agricultural products, and ensure the successful completion of the harvesting and processing of agricultural products; to plow fallow land in the shortest possible time and improve the quality of cultivation; to organize haymaking in an organized manner and complete the plan for storing feed.

　　The decision further summarized the achievements of collective farms, machine and tractor stations, and state farms in repairing tractors and agricultural machinery, saying: This work was also done better than last year. As of the 10th of this month, 22,000 more combine harvesters, 5,500 more compound threshers, 15,700 more single threshers, and 16,000 more harvesters have been repaired than in the same period last year. Machine and tractor stations, state farms, and collective farms have also done a better job than last year in training combine harvester drivers, deputies, mechanics, truck drivers, and other workers for harvesting work. Currently, more than 32,000 combine harvester drivers, 6,000 truck drivers, and a large number of other people using power farming are being trained in schools and training classes run by machine and tractor stations and state farms.

　　The decision stipulates that the repair and cleaning of all harvesters and transportation equipment must be completed fifteen days before the start of harvesting, and to ensure that a periodic work plan for harvesting, transporting, and paying agricultural products to the state is formulated in every collective farm, machine and tractor station, and state farm, in every tractor team and farmland cultivation team. The decision instructs the leaders of Party and Soviet local organizations and the Soviet Ministry of Agriculture and the Soviet Ministry of State Farms to inspect every machine and tractor station and state farm no later than twenty days before the start of harvesting to check whether they have made preparations for harvesting.

　　The decision then stipulated specific measures to prepare granaries and grain dryers for receiving and storing agricultural products.

　　The decision instructs that in order to launch the harvesting work in a timely manner, it is necessary to widely adopt the method of harvesting where it is ripe, without waiting for the entire area to be fully mature before harvesting, in order to avoid losses.

　　The decision also calls for attention to be paid to properly organizing and calculating the work done by harvesting work teams and work groups to ensure the issuance of extra remuneration and in-kind wages exceeding the harvest amount.

　　The decision states in conclusion: It is necessary to widely explain to collective farmers, workers of machine and tractor stations and state farms that the timely and lossless harvesting and implementation of the plan for processing agricultural products by each collective farm and state farm is of great economic and political significance for the successful completion of the five-year plan for restoring and developing the Soviet national economy, and for further consolidating the strength of the Soviet state and improving the people's living standards.

　　苏联颁布收割与处理农产品决定
  　周密准备保证丰收
    【新华社北平十七日电】塔斯社讯：苏联部长会议与苏联共产党中央委员会十四日发布决定，规定今年收割与处理农产品的详细纲领。
    决定首先总结了苏联今年春季播种的成绩说：今春的播种组织得比去年好。集体农场、机器与拖拉机站以及国营农场，在较短的时间内完成了播种工作，工作质量比以前更为优良，因而保证了最大限度地增加粮食、工业作物及其他作物的产量。春麦和工业作物大体上是用选出的种籽在休耕地和去年秋天耕好了的土地上播种的，并且按照国家的计划，扩大了棉花、亚麻、大麻、甜菜、向日葵等主要工业作物及春麦、冬麦、裸麦及谷物的播种面积。为了完成发展牲畜饲养三年计划中所规定的充分供给饲料的任务，多年生与一年生的牧草播种面积将近增加了一倍，饲料、根类作物及秣草的播种面积，也增加了一半。同时，植造森林防护带和建立苗圃的计划，也都大大超过了。
    决定继即给苏联农业部、苏联国营农场部、党的组织、苏维埃的组织、农业机关、集体农场、机器与拖拉机站，及国家农场规定了目前的主要任务：组织对一切作物的及时的与彻底的耘草工作；进行收割与处理农产品的周密的准备工作，保证农产品的收割与处理工作能够胜利进行；在最短期间耕完休耕地，并改善耕种工作的质量；有组织地进行收置干草的工作，完成储存饲料的计划。
    决定进一步总结了集体农场、机器与拖拉机站、国营农场在修理拖拉机与农业机器方面的成绩说：这一工作也比去年做得好。到本月十日为止，比去年同时期多修好了两万二千部联合收割机、五千五百部复合打谷机、一万五千七百部单一打谷机和一万六千部收割机。机器与拖拉机站、国营农场与集体农场为了收割工作训练联合机驾驶员，副手、机械士、卡车司机及其他工人的工作，也做得比去年好。现在有三万二千多名联合收割机驾驶员，六千名卡车司机及大批其他使用动力耕作的人员，正在机器与拖拉机站和国家农场所开办的学校和训练班中受训。
    决定规定在开始收割的十五天之前完成修理和擦洗一切收割机和运输工具的工作，并保证在每一个集体农场、机器与拖拉机站、及国营农场上、在每一个拖拉机队和农田耕作队当中，订出收割、运输和缴纳农产品给国家的定期的工作计划。决定责成党和苏维埃地方组织的领导者及苏联农业部和苏联国营农场部，必须至迟在开始收割的二十天之前，对每一个机器与拖拉机站和国营农场进行检查，检查它们是否已做好了收割的准备工作。
    决定继即规定了具体措施，以准备收纳和储藏农产品的谷仓和谷物干燥器等设备。
    决定指示要及时地展开收割工作，必须广泛采用那里熟就割那里的方法，不必等待大片地区全部成熟再去收割，以避免损失。
    决定并号召必须注意适当地组织和计算收获期工作队与工作组所做的工作，以保证发给超过收获量的额外报酬和实物工资。
    决定在结语中声称：必须向集体农民、机器与拖拉机站和国营农厂的工人广泛地解释：每一集体农场和国营农场及时地无损失地收割并执行处理农产品的计划，对于胜利的完成恢复和发展苏联国民经济的五年计划，和进一步巩固苏维埃国家的力量与增进人民的生活水平，有重大的经济和政治意义。
