【Taihang Dispatch】Since the beginning of summer, various places in the Taihang area have universally launched health and epidemic prevention work. All 850 doctors in the Second Special District, after being assessed, have participated in health propaganda work and the summer epidemic prevention campaign. Everyone has generally established the viewpoint of serving the people, clarified that epidemic prevention is more important than treatment, treatment must be combined with epidemic prevention, and organized countless medical and health centers at the district level to unify propaganda and treatment. In addition, various counties have also established midwifery training classes. In Zuoquan and Yueshe counties alone, the first phase has trained 160 midwives. Shexian, Shahe, and Wenxian counties have universally organized doctors to go to the countryside to carry out epidemic prevention injections in conjunction with health propaganda. Shexian County has formed five epidemic prevention and medical teams. The Henan Dian team alone injected and treated 726 people in five days. The Wenxian County Health Committee formed a temporary epidemic prevention injection team on May 14th and went deep into the epidemic areas to give injections to the masses. In six villages, 1,122 people have been injected with cholera and typhoid mixed vaccines, and 359 people have been vaccinated. Wuxiang, Huguan, Wenxian, Jiaozuo, PingShun and other places have also mobilized women to carry out a health combined manure accumulation campaign. The Fourth and Fifth Special Districts have also successively assessed and organized doctors, strengthened health leadership, and enthusiastically launched an epidemic prevention and treatment campaign. Zuoquan and other places have combined anti-superstition with health work. In addition, the Xingtai Veterinary Station of the Agricultural College of North China University has also actively gone to the countryside to prevent and treat sick livestock for the masses. In nine days, a total of 1,028 head of sick livestock were injected and treated. At present, health work in various places is actively underway, and they are working together to ensure the health of people and livestock and smoothly complete the "one inch increase in production."
    【Southern Hebei Dispatch】Southern Hebei District has achieved great success in spring health construction and continues to deploy the summer and autumn epidemic prevention campaign. Since March, under the leadership of the Southern Hebei Health Bureau, various special counties have mobilized and organized doctors in the countryside to universally vaccinate against smallpox. According to incomplete statistics, a total of 283,974 people have been vaccinated, effectively preventing and stopping the spread of smallpox. Six special district hospitals and twenty-six county hospitals have been built, providing great convenience for people to treat diseases. According to statistics from the Daming County Limin Sheng Hospital for five months, it admitted 152 inpatients and 18,000 outpatients. In order to break the backward ideas of conservatism and mutual contempt among folk Chinese and Western doctors, twelve county and city medical research societies were organized to achieve preliminary consultations, learn from each other's strengths, and seek unity. The Third Special District trained 70 midwives, increasing the development of maternal and infant health services. On June 3rd, the Health Bureau held a meeting to deploy summer and autumn epidemic prevention work, and decided that in addition to medical personnel and working cadres, students from various schools should organize propaganda teams to carry out epidemic prevention propaganda in crowded places such as fairs and temple fairs. In addition to organizing epidemic prevention medical teams in various places, doctors in the countryside with injection techniques should be organized into groups, divided into villages and towns, and be responsible for them separately. Fixed injection points should be set up at the intersections of towns and fortresses. In towns and markets with concentrated populations, residents should be mobilized to carry out planned campaigns to eliminate flies, fleas, lice, and mites. Vaccines have now been distributed to various places and injections have begun.
