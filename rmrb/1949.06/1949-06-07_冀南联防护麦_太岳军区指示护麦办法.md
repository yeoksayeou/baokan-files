[Jinan Electric] Jinan militia organizations have formed a joint defense, patrolling day and night to protect the wheat harvest, preventing special agents, bandits, and local bullies from disrupting social order and sabotaging production. To protect the fruits of the farmers' labor, the Jinan Administrative Office and the Jinan People's Armed Forces Department issued instructions on wheat protection in mid-May. Party and government leading organs in each special county have successively arranged to rectify militia organizations for joint defense and launched mass wheat protection campaigns. More than ten counties, including Weixian, Handan, Yongzhi, Weixian, Qinghe, and Ningnan, have held meetings of district and village cadres, militia squads, or all village militiamen to conduct ideological mobilization for wheat protection and mobilize farmers to sign "Wheat Protection Pledges," creating a mass wheat protection movement. The Fifth District of Weixian decided that children and women would guard the fields during the day, and the militia self-defense teams would patrol at night. Each district in Weixian first studied suspicious individuals and those with theft behavior and placed them under necessary surveillance. Village militias were organized into companies, platoons, and groups for unified leadership and division of labor for patrols. Qinghe reorganized and equipped each district based on the number of militiamen and firearms in each village, and established a merit book for periodic awards. In the villages around Yinjiazhuang, buckets of water were also placed next to the threshing floors to prevent arson and sabotage. District governments and public security departments also actively cooperated with farmers in the wheat harvest, promptly patrolling and solving cases. Zhang Chaoyou, who sabotaged wheat seedlings and stole wheat in Nanguan, Handan City, has been sentenced to ten months in prison by the municipal government.

[Jinan Electric] Weixian, Jize, Qinghe, and other counties have begun to enter the intense wheat harvest. This year, the wheat planting area has been expanded unprecedentedly. Drought and strong winds have shortened the ripening time of wheat. To prevent wind, hail, water, and fire disasters, farmers are stepping up harvesting. Under the slogan of "Quick Harvest, Quick Threshing, Quick Storage," farmers in Chengguan, Weixian County, with all men and women, young and old, mobilized to cut wheat in Nanli Village. The village of three hundred households completed harvesting seven hundred acres in two days. Village-level cadres in Xiguan Village and Panzhuang Village, Qinghe, mobilized farmers with the principle of "Seize the Autumn Harvest, Help Each Other, and It Won't Be Difficult." All fifty households and twenty-four head of livestock in the village formed temporary human and animal mutual aid groups on a voluntary basis. Cadres have strengthened leadership in the wheat harvest. For example, cadres in the Fifth District of Xin County are mostly locals, and some have the idea of going home for the wheat harvest. The district committee then convened a meeting of all district cadres to mobilize them to earnestly lead the wheat harvest. After enlightenment and mobilization, everyone realized that the wheat planting area this year is very large, and strengthening leadership to protect the wheat harvest and ensure that "every grain goes into the barn" is a major task at present. They unanimously expressed that they would strengthen leadership and personally go to the fields to help the masses harvest wheat, guide the selection of wheat seeds, and organize militia joint defense to protect the wheat harvest. They also studied solutions for some cadres whose families were really in difficulty. Everyone said happily: "The Northeast Army and the southward cadres may not necessarily go home for the New Year; it's nothing for us not to go home during the wheat harvest!"

[Taiyue Electric] As the summer harvest work is about to begin, the Taiyue Military Region Headquarters, in order to overcome the slack and paralysis in the militia in various places, prevent special agents and thieves from sabotage, and strengthen social security, issued a notice to various sub-districts and county military committees on May 20, pointing out specific methods for organizing militia patrols in the fields: (1) Obligatory field patrols, uniformly organized by the village militia self-defense team, divided into groups, and patrolling in shifts day and night. (2) Militia contract field patrols, divided into several groups by the militia, rotating on duty, and stipulating a certain wage as remuneration. This wage, in addition to the militia voluntarily drawing a part as the village militia public fund (buying gun oil, etc.), must never be wasted, and the majority should be distributed to the militia themselves. (3) A small number of people contract field patrols. A small number of militia and masses voluntarily organize several groups to contract field patrols, stipulate a certain wage, and are fully enjoyed by the patrolmen themselves. However, no matter what method is adopted, the patrolmen must be responsible to the masses.

　　冀南联防护麦
  　太岳军区指示护麦办法
    【冀南电】冀南民兵组织联防，昼夜巡逻保卫麦收。防止特务匪徒及地痞流氓扰乱社会秩序，破坏生产。为保卫农民劳动成果，冀南行署及冀南人民武装部于五月中旬下达护麦指示，各专县党政领导机关，均先后布置整顿民兵组织联防，开展群众性的护麦运动。魏县、邯郸、永智、威县、清河、宁南等十余县，均分别召开区村干部及民兵中队或全村民兵会，进行护麦思想动员，发动农民订立“护麦公约”，造成群众性的护麦运动。魏县五区决定白天儿童妇女看守，晚上民兵自卫队站岗巡逻；威县各区首先研究可疑的分子及有偷盗行为的分子，予以必要的监视；各村民兵编成连、排、组统一领导，分工巡逻；清河各区根据各村民兵人数、枪支情况，重新调剂配备，并建立立功簿，定期评奖；殷家庄一带村庄打麦场边还放上几桶水，以防焚烧破坏。各区政府及公安部门亦积极配合农民麦收，及时巡察破获案件。邯市南关破坏麦苗偷麦犯张朝友，市政府已叛徒刑十个月。
    【冀南电】威县、鸡泽、清河等县，开始进入紧张麦收。今年种麦面积空前扩大，天旱风多，缩短了麦熟时间，为防止遭受风、雹、水、火之灾，农民正加紧收割。威县城关农民在“快收快打快入仓”口号下，南里村全村男女青壮年一齐出动割麦，不能下地的老年人在家看孩子、做饭、喂牲口。三百户的村庄两天割完七百亩。清河西关村、潘庄村级干部以“争秋夺麦，互助起来不作难”的道理，动员农民，全村五十户二十四头牲口，在自愿原则下，全部组成临时人畜互助组。在麦收中干部加强领导，如莘县五区干部，多是本地人，有些有回家过麦思想，区委遂召集全体区干部会议，动员认真领导麦收。经过启发动员，大家认识到今年种麦面积很大，加强领导保卫麦收，保证“粒粒归仓”是当前重大任务，一致表示要加强领导亲自下地帮助群众收麦，指导选麦种，并组织民兵联防保卫麦收。对某些干部家中实在困难的，也研究了解决办法，大家都很愉快的说：“东北大军和南下干部过年也不一定回家；咱们麦里不回更算不了什么！”
    【太岳电】夏收工作即将开始，太岳军区司令部为克服各地民兵中的松懈麻痹思想，防止特务小偷破坏，加强社会治安，特于五月二十日给各分会、各县武委会发出通知，指出具体组织民兵巡田办法：（一）义务巡田，由全村民兵自卫队统一组织，划编小组，日夜轮班巡田。（二）民兵包揽巡田，由民兵划分若干小组，轮流值日，规定一定工资作为报酬，此项工资除民兵自愿抽出一部作为村里民兵公费（买擦枪油等），绝不准浪费外，大部应分给民兵自己享受。（三）少数人包揽巡田。由民兵和群众少数自愿组织若干小组包揽巡田，规定一定工资，完全由巡田者自己享受。但不论采取何种办法，巡田者要对群众负责。
