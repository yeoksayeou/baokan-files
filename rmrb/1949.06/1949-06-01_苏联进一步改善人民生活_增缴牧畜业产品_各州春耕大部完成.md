　　Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, May 31st: Moscow News: The Soviet Council of Ministers and the Central Committee of the Soviet Communist Party issued a decision on rewarding the payment of livestock products, stating: Under the conditions of the smooth development of the national economy after the war, one of the most important tasks of the Soviet state is to supply the people with abundant food, the light industry with abundant raw materials, and the state with abundant food and raw materials as necessary reserves in the shortest possible time. In order to adapt to the development of the national economy and to further improve the people's welfare, it is required that the amount of livestock products (meat, fat, milk, butter, eggs, hides, wool, etc.) to be paid should be increased by at least 50 to 100 percent within three years. In order to reward meritorious personnel, the Soviet Council of Ministers and the Central Committee of the CPSU specially recommended to the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union: to award medals and badges to the staff of government agencies and cooperatives, party cadres, and Soviet personnel who have successfully completed the livestock product payment plan and processing plan.
　　Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, May 30th: Moscow News: The spring plowing movement in various states of the Soviet Union is mostly coming to an end. As of May 20, the sown area was 6.6 million hectares more than in the same period last year, and 3 million hectares of land were plowed for autumn sowing, which is seven times that of the same period last year. Machine and tractor stations played a decisive role in achieving these achievements. The Soviet government and the Bolshevik Party took all measures to mechanize Soviet agriculture. A large number of tractors, combine harvesters, plows, seeders, cultivators, and many other machines designed by Soviet designers are continuously being transported to machine and tractor stations and collective farms. As of May 20, the workload of tractors used by machine and tractor stations has exceeded the workload of the same period last year, and in terms of plowing, it has actually exceeded 12 million hectares. The workload and productivity of each tractor in the machine and tractor station have greatly exceeded the pre-war level of 1940.

    【新华社北平三十一日电】莫斯科讯：苏联部长会议与苏联共产党中央发表关于奖励缴纳牧畜业产品的决定，内称：在战后国民经济顺利发展的条件下，苏维埃国家一个最重要的任务，就是要在最短期间供给人民丰富的粮食、供给轻工业丰富的原料、供给国家丰富的粮食和原料作为必要的储备。为了适应国家经济的发展、为了进一步改善人民福利，要求牧畜业产品（肉类、脂肪、牛奶、牛油、蛋类、兽皮、羊毛等）的缴纳量在三年之内至少要增加百分之五十到百分之一百。为了奖励有功的人员，苏联部长会议与联共中央特向苏联最高主席团建议：发给勋章和奖章给那些胜利地完成牧畜业产品缴纳计划和加工计划的政府机关和合作社的职员，党的干部和苏维埃人员。
