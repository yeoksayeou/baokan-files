Xinhua News Agency, Beiping, 20th—The U.S. State Department issued a lengthy statement on June 10th, reiterating the U.S. position of unilaterally announcing the cessation of Japanese reparations on May 12th of this year. The statement declared: "Halting the removal of reparations from Japan is a necessary step to complete the Allied basic policy goals for Japan." The statement pointed out that the U.S. position is fully in line with the Potsdam Agreement and the relevant provisions of the Far Eastern Commission's basic policy towards Japan. The statement also put forward some unfounded reasons to quibble for the U.S.'s reactionary stance of stopping Japanese reparations.

    Observers here recently commented on this, saying: The U.S. State Department's statement is a confirmation of the U.S. government's reversal of right and wrong. Contrary to the facts and the U.S. State Department's arbitrary statement, the U.S. position of stopping Japanese reparations completely violated the relevant provisions of the Potsdam Agreement and the Far Eastern Commission's basic policy towards Japan. Clause 11 of the Potsdam Declaration regarding Japan clearly stipulated: "Japan shall be permitted to maintain such industries as will sustain her economy and permit the exaction of just reparations in kind, but not those which would enable her to re-arm for war." The Far Eastern Commission's basic policy toward Japan, promulgated on June 20, 1947, also determined: "Only industries that maintain Japan's democratic economy and pay for reparations items are allowed to develop, while industries that enable Japan to rearm are absolutely not allowed to exist." The Far Eastern Commission's resolution on Japanese reparations, adopted on August 14, 1947, similarly stipulated that "all basic and secondary industries should be designated as reparations." Based on Pauley's reparations plan, the Far Eastern Commission passed a resolution specifically stipulating which factories should be dismantled and used as reparations. The U.S.'s provisional reparations plan, published in April 1947, was drafted in accordance with this resolution at the request of many countries. It can be seen that both the Potsdam Agreement and the Far Eastern Commission's resolutions clearly stipulated that Japan should implement legitimate and fair reparations. Can these resolutions, written in black and white, be concealed and overturned with an arbitrary statement?

    The U.S. State Department said in its statement: There is no contradiction to be found between the U.S.'s position on the reparations issue and Japan's continued effective disarmament and demilitarization. And it also said: Japan has been completely disarmed. But the fact is completely another matter. Many solid pieces of evidence prove that Japan has not been completely disarmed, and Japan's military industry is not only basically intact but is also being expanded. Here, it is enough to simply give one example. According to the provisional reparations plan issued by the U.S. government on April 4, 1947, it was stipulated that the U.S. should first extract 30% of the thousand aircraft factories, shipyards, and arsenals designated by MacArthur as reparations and allocate them to China, the United Kingdom, the Philippines, and the Netherlands. These factories were undoubtedly military industries that Japan once used to launch and conduct aggressive wars. However, U.S. policy has repeatedly decided to preserve these military industries, and now it has decided to stop reparations. Isn't this rearming Japan? Isn't this violating the principles of purging Japanese militarism and destroying the Japanese war industry in Clauses 6 and 7 of the Potsdam Declaration? Therefore, the question is not to find any contradiction "between the U.S.'s position on the reparations issue and Japan's continued effective disarmament and demilitarization," because this is the simplest and easiest thing. The question is to first ask the gentlemen of the U.S. government to plug the contradictions in the statement itself. Since your statement says "Japan has been completely disarmed," why did you carelessly reveal that you "want to continue disarming Japan"?

    The U.S. State Department's statement also proclaimed: The U.S. must assist Japan in achieving a self-sufficient economy. Therefore, extracting reparations from Japan's deficit-ridden economy is obviously at odds with this goal. This is simply a fairy tale of deceiving oneself and others. Everyone knows that the factories first designated as reparations for Japan were all military industries. Therefore, the dismantling of these factories for reparations has nothing to do with the recovery and development of Japan's peaceful economy. On the contrary, Japan will never be able to achieve a truly self-sufficient economy under the U.S.'s cultivation of militaristic reactionary forces, preservation and expansion of military industries, and implementation of cruel colonial exploitation policies. The U.S. government's decision to stop reparations is clearly not to assist Japan in achieving a self-sufficient economy, but to turn Japan into its arsenal and base of aggression in the Far East.

    The Chinese people will never recognize the validity of this arbitrary and illegal decision by the United States. The Chinese people will adhere to the unshakable principles of the Potsdam Agreement and demand the destruction of Japanese military industries and the implementation of fair reparations. Only in this way will it truly conform to the interests of the people of China and other countries, as well as the people of Japan.

### 美国务院武断声明停止日本赔偿  北平观察家严予驳斥  中国人民反对美帝非法决定  坚持波茨坦协定的既定原则

    美国务院武断声明停止日本赔偿
    北平观察家严予驳斥
    中国人民反对美帝非法决定
    坚持波茨坦协定的既定原则
    【新华社北平二十日电】美国国务院于六月十日发表一项冗长的声明，重申美国于本年五月十二日片面宣布的停止日本赔偿之决议的立场。声明宣称：“停止向日本搬取赔偿物资，为完成盟国对日基本政策目标之必要步骤。”声明指出美国这一立场，与波茨坦协定及远东委员会对日基本政策有关条款完全符合。声明并提出了一些莫须有的理由，为美国停止日本赔偿的反动立场进行诡辩。
    此间观察家顷对此发表评论称：美国国务院这个声明，是美国政府颠倒是非的一个确证。事实和美国国务院的武断声明相反，美国停止日本赔偿的立场，完全破坏了波茨坦协定及远东委员会对日基本政策的有关条款。波茨坦对日公告第十一款曾明确地规定：“日本将被准许保持为维持其经济所需要及可以偿付实物赔偿的工业，但可以使其重新武装作战的工业，不在其内。”远东委员会于一九四七年六月二十日公布的对日基本政策也确定：“只有维持日本民主经济及支付赔偿物品的工业，才许其发展，而使日本能重整军备的工业，则绝对不许存在。”远东委员会于一九四七年八月十四日通过的关于日本赔偿的决议，同样地规定“一切基本与次要的工业，均应划作赔偿”。远东委员会根据鲍莱的赔偿计划，曾经通过一个决议，具体规定了那些工厂应予拆毁，充作赔偿。美国一九四七年四月发表的临时赔偿计划，正是在许多国家的要求下根据这个决议而拟定的。由此可见，无论波茨坦协定与远东委员会的决议，都曾明明白白地规定了日本应该实行正当的公允的赔偿。这些用黑字写在白纸上的决议，难道是用武断的声明就可以掩盖和推翻的吗？
    美国国务院在其声明中说：美国对赔偿问题的立场与日本继续进行有效之解除武装及解除日本军备之间，实无矛盾可以发现。而且又说：日本已完全解除武装。但是事实却完全是另一回事。许多确实的证据证明：日本并没有被完全解除武装，日本的军事工业不但基本上保持完整，而且正在被扩充之中。这里只要简单地举出一个例子就够了。依照美国政府一九四七年四月四日发布的临时赔偿计划，规定美国应在麦克阿瑟划作赔偿的一千座飞机制造厂、造船厂及兵工厂中，先行提取百分之三十分配与中、英、菲、荷四国。这些工厂都是为日本曾经用以发动和进行侵略战争的军事工业是毫无疑问的了。但美国政策一再决定保存这些军事工业，现又决定停止赔偿，这不是为了重新武装日本是什么？不是违反波茨坦公告第六、七款关于肃清日本军国主义、摧毁日本战争工业的原则又是什么？因此，问题已不是要在“美国赔偿问题的立场与日本继续进行有效之解除武装和军备之间”，去发现什么矛盾，因为这是一件最简单、最容易不过的事。问题是要先请美国政府的大人先生们去堵塞一下声明本身的矛盾。你们的声明既然说“日本已完全解除武装”，但为什么又不小心地露出马脚“要继续解除日本武装”呢？
    美国国务院的声明又宣扬：美国必须协助日本达到自给自足的经济,因此自入不敷出的日本经济中索取赔偿，显然与此目标大相迳庭。这简直是一段欺人自欺的童话。谁都知道，日本首先被划作赔偿的工厂，都是军事工业，因此，这些工厂的拆卸充作赔偿，与日本和平经济的恢复与发展，没有丝毫关系。相反地，日本在美国扶植军国主义反动势力、保存与扩大军事工业及实行残酷的殖民地榨取政策之下，才会永远地无法达到真正的自给自足经济。美国政府之决定停止赔偿，显然不是为了什么协助日本达到自给自足的经济，而是为了把日本变成它在远东的兵工厂与侵略基地。
    对于美国这一专横的非法决定，中国人民决不会承认其有任何效力。中国人民将坚持波茨坦协定不可动摇的原则，要求摧毁日本军事工业，实行公允的赔偿。只有这样，才真正符合于中国与其他国家人民以及日本人民的利益。
