On the Restoration and Development of Production in Small and Medium-Sized Cities in North China
    Xu Dui
  　I. Changes and Trends:
    With the liberation of the entire North China region and the rapid victorious development of the national revolutionary situation, under the conditions of the beginning of urban-rural material exchange and foreign trade development, the issue of the restoration and development of production in small and medium-sized cities in North China will inevitably lead to new changes and developments. It will break the self-sufficient economic scope of the past dozen years during the War of Resistance Against Japan and the Self-Defense Liberation War, closely link and mutually depend on the small-scale industrial and handicraft production of small and medium-sized cities and the machine production of large cities, and realize the rational division of urban and rural production according to the specific conditions of each region.
    There are two relatively obvious changes and trends: the liberation of large cities such as Tianjin and Beijing will inevitably promote the activity and development of many production undertakings in small and medium-sized cities. For example, after the liberation of cities such as Tianjin, Qingdao, and Jinan, a large amount of cotton wadding will be needed, which will inevitably promote the activity of the cotton ginning industry in small and medium-sized cities in cotton-producing areas; the large amount of straw sacks needed by major cities will lead to the development of the straw weaving industry, a specialty of Yongnian in southern Hebei and Jinghai in central Hebei, which had shrunk in the past due to lack of sales. The area has now begun to vigorously support it, provide technical guidance, organize its reorganization to improve quality, which is entirely necessary and correct; other industries such as the hand-made straw braid industry in Xianxian in central Hebei and Qingfeng and Nanle in Hebei-Shandong-Henan, which require small and medium-sized cities to initially manufacture raw materials into semi-finished products for final processing by large cities, will also develop. At the same time, with the development of export trade, the export volume of local products and mountain goods in various parts of North China is gradually increasing. According to statistics from the Tianjin Foreign Trade Corporation: the export of mountain goods in March was 1,902 quintals (each quintal is 200 catties); in April it increased to 6,036 quintals, an increase of more than two times compared to the previous month; the export figures in May were even larger, and prices generally rose. Comparing prices on May 1st and May 25th, black and white melon seeds had the highest increase, with an average increase of 120% to 150% per 100 catties. At the same time, the pig bristle industry has also begun to recover. North China is one of the three major bristle-producing areas in the country. Before the incident, it accounted for 60% of Tianjin's export trade, and its products were of excellent quality and world-renowned. Currently, in order to restore the export of pig bristles, Hebei, Chahar, Hebei-Shandong-Henan and other producing areas have begun to collect bristles. The purchase price of pig bristles by the North China Trade Corporation in Tianjin has risen from 12 million yuan per set (100 catties per box, 55 boxes per set) in early May to 22.5 million yuan in late May. In order to strengthen the pig bristle manufacturing industry, under the support of the People's Government, Baoding and Xugezhuang in eastern Tianjin, which specialize in sorting bristles, have also begun to recover.
    On the other hand, some industries and handicrafts that have developed through artificial efforts in a self-sufficient economy due to a lack of production raw materials and technical conditions have begun to show signs of decline and shrinking. For example, the hand-rolled cigarette industry in small cities and the textile industry in the Taihang and Wutai mountain areas have generally developed during the War of Resistance, but due to backward technology and high costs, profits have been greatly reduced and sales have been sluggish under the influence of machine-made industrial products. For this reason, five private cigarette companies in Heze Hengtai and Baofeng in Hebei-Shandong-Henan have begun to switch industries and jointly operate a machine oil pressing factory, which officially opened on the 21st of this month.
    At present, this new change is not yet very obvious, mainly because the production of major cities has not been fully restored, the output is small, and transportation is not smooth. However, the change will gradually develop and become increasingly clear, so relevant leaders at all levels must have a visionary perspective and carry out planned, organized, and prepared guidance as early as possible.
    II. What to Develop?
    Looking at the above situation, since the change has already begun, what is the direction of future development? According to the general policy of building cities by "rapidly restoring and developing industrial production and transforming consumer cities into producer cities," it is certainly beyond doubt to provide support and development to the production undertakings of small and medium-sized cities. The principle of supporting development needs to take into account the needs of both large-city industrial and agricultural production and life, and there are roughly several situations: 1. For those whose industrial production in large cities cannot currently meet the needs of the masses, and where there are existing raw materials and a production base, continued support should be given to their development, such as oil pressing and cotton ginning in central Hebei, textile industry in Gaoyang, kiln porcelain industry in Tangshan, and the iron and wood production tool manufacturing industry in various places. However, national trade authorities should provide assistance and leadership in a planned and organized manner according to the overall situation and the needs of supply and demand in various places, and reduce blindness in production as much as possible to achieve normal development. 2. For those that can be completely replaced by large-city production, such as cigarettes, soap making, and the hand-made textile industry in some areas, production should be proactively and gradually reduced or organized to switch industries, and there should be no hesitation or blind development. Local economic departments should provide necessary assistance and do a good job in the aftermath work to avoid major impacts on their lives and production due to the change of industry. 3. For those that cannot be replaced by large-city industrial production and are necessary for urban and rural production and life, such as various export products, mountain goods, medicinal materials, pig bristles, fur, chicken eggs, and certain special handicrafts in various places that have already begun to become active, the state-owned economy should provide strong support, mainly to solve the difficulties of funding and transportation, strengthen technical guidance, and carry out reorganization to improve quality to facilitate development.
    III. Two Issues:
    First, when Tianjin and Beijing were initially liberated, the North China trade department, in order to purchase a large amount of cotton to supply Zhongfang, adopted a "squeeze" policy for rural hand-made textiles. This overly hasty measure was obviously wrong. Because China's current industry is not too much but too little, the current production capacity of urban industries cannot meet the needs of the masses, and foreign yarn and foreign cloth are not enough to solve all the needs of rural areas. Therefore, the textile industry in central and southern Hebei can still exist, and some have a solid technical foundation, a long history and a certain market, such as Gaoyang cloth, which can still be developed to a certain extent.
    Second, the leading departments of industry and commerce and the state-owned trade organs and supply and marketing cooperatives in various places should take out a certain amount of strength to help small and medium-sized cities solve the current urgent need to solve the sales problems of the above-mentioned industrial and handicraft products. Due to the long-term war environment, urban and rural areas are separated and transportation is inconvenient, so materials are stagnant and cannot be exchanged. Because the production of small and medium-sized cities is often not sold in the place where it is produced, but is supplied to other places, such as the market for Gaoyang cloth is in Shanxi, Suiyuan, southern Hebei, and central Hebei. The market for straw weaving industry is in Tianjin, and this kind of long-distance transportation cannot be solved by private forces or handicraft workers with a sideline production nature. Therefore, it is necessary for the state-owned economy to provide appropriate support, and long-term sales should be carried out in a planned and organized manner.

　　关于华北中小城市恢复与发展生产问题
    徐兑
  　一、变化与趋势：
    随着华北全区解放及全国革命形势的迅速胜利发展，在城乡物资交流与对外贸易开始发展的条件下，华北各中小城市的恢复与发展生产问题，势必引起新的变化和发展。它将打破过去十数年来在抗日战争与自卫解放战争时期的自给自足经济范围，使中小城市的小型工业与手工业生产和大城市的机器生产密切联系与相互依存，并根据各区的具体条件，实现城乡生产的合理分工。
    较为明显的变化和趋势有两个方面，这就是由于平津等大城市的解放，中小城市的许多生产事业必将随着活跃与发展起来。比如天津、青岛、济南等城市解放后，将需要大量的棉绒，这必将促进产棉区各中小城市轧花业的活跃；各大城市需要之大量蒲包，冀南永年及冀中静海一带的特产编蒲业，必将由过去没有销路因而萎缩的情况走向发展，现该地已着手大力扶助，并加以技术指导，组织整装提高质量，这是完全必要和正确的；其它如需要中小城市将原料经过初步制造为半成品，供给大城市最后加工完成的工业，如冀中献县及冀鲁豫清丰、南乐一带的掏草帽辫手工业也将发展；其次，过去由于城乡阻隔，缺乏大城市的技术指导及某些机件器材，如轧花机的皮轴、压花机的弓条等，现在由有大城市的充分供应，加以华北棉产的逐年增加，这种小型的制造轧花、弹花机的铁工业，必将适应的发展起来。同时随着出口贸易的开展，华北各地土产山货的出口量日渐增多。据天津对外贸易公司的统计：三月份出口山货一千九百零二公担（每公担二百斤）；四月份增为六千零卅六公担，较前增加两倍多；五月份出口数字尤大，且价格普遍上涨，按五月一日与二十五日价格比较，其中以黑白瓜子上涨最高，每百斤平均提高百分之一百二十至一百五十。同时猪鬃业也开始恢复，华北为全国三大鬃产区之一，事变前占天津出口贸易的百分之六十，产品优良世界闻名。目前为恢复猪鬃的出口，河北、察哈尔、冀鲁豫等产区均已开始收毛，华北贸易总公司在天津收买猪鬃的牌价，由五月上旬至下旬，每套（百斤为一箱，五十五箱为一套）由一千二百万元上升为二千二百五十万元；为加强猪鬃制造业，在人民政府的扶助下，保定及津东胥各庄的特有的整理鬃毛业亦开始恢复。
    变化的另一方面，是某些缺乏生产原料与技术条件，在自给自足的经济情况下，经人为的努力而发展起来的工业与手工业，则开始呈现萧条和萎缩。如小城市的手工卷烟业及太行、五台山区的纺织业，在抗战期间虽然普遍的发展起来，但由于技术落后成本高，在机器工业品的影响下，利润大减，销路不畅。为此，冀鲁豫菏泽恒泰、保丰等五家私营卷烟业已开始转业，合资经营一座机器榨油厂，于本月二十一日正式开张。
    目前这一新的变化虽然还不十分明显，这主要是由于各大城市的生产尚未全部恢复，产量较小，及交通运输亦未畅通。但变化终将逐渐发展而日益明确，故各级有关领导必须有预见性的眼光，即早进行有计划有组织有准备的指导。
    二、发展什么？
    综观上述情况，变化既已开始，那么今后的发展方向是什么呢？根据“迅速恢复与发展工业生产，变消费城市为生产城市”这一建设城市的总方针，对于中小城市的生产事业给予扶助和发展是肯定无疑的。扶助发展的原则，则需照顾到大城市工业与农业生产及生活的需要两方面，大致有这样几种情况：一、凡大城市工业生产目前尚不能满足群众需要者，而各地在既有原料和生产基础的条件下，仍应继续扶持其发展，如冀中的榨油、轧花业，高阳的纺织业，唐山的窑瓷业及各地的铁、木生产工具制造业等。但国家贸易机关应根据全面情况，按照各地供求需要，有计划有组织的加以帮助和领导，尽可能减少生产上的盲目性，以达到正常发展。二、凡大城市生产已能全部代替者，如卷烟、造胰及部分地区的手工纺织业等，则应主动的、有步骤的减缩生产或组织转业，不得顾惜犹疑或盲目发展。各地经济部门应予以必要的协助，做好善后工作，以免因转业而使其生活和生产受到大的影响。三、凡大城市工业生产所不能代替，而又为城乡生产与生活所必需者，如目前已开始活跃的各种出口品，山货、药材、猪鬃、皮毛、鸡子及各地某些特种手工业，国营经济应给以大力扶助，主要是解决其资金与运输的困难，加强技术指导，进行整装提高质量以利发展。
    三、两个问题：
    第一、在平津初解放时，华北贸易部门为了大量采购棉花，供给中纺，曾对农村手工纺织采取“挤”的方针，这种过于急性的措置，显然是不对的。因为中国目前的工业不是多而是少，目前城市工业的生产能力还满足不了群众的需要，洋纱洋布还不足以解决全部农村的需要，故冀中冀南的纺织业还能够存在，有些有较巩固的技术基础，有悠久的历史和一定的市场，如高阳布，还可以得到一定的发展。
    第二、各地工商部领导部门及国家贸易机关和供销合作社应拿出一定的力量，来帮助各中小城市解决当前迫切需要解决的上述工业与手工业产品的销路问题。由于在长期的战争环境中，城乡阻隔，交通不便，故物资停滞不得交流。因为中小城市的生产，常常是该地生产并不是该地销售，而是供给别地需要的，如高阳布的市场是在山西、绥远、冀南、冀中。编蒲业的市场是在天津，而这种长途运销为私人力量或带有副业生产性质的手工业者不能单独解决的。因此国营经济给予恰当的扶助是必要的，应有计划有组织的进行长足销售。
