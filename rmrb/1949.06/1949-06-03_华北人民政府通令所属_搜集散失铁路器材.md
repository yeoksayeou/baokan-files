　　North China People's Government Issues Circular to Subordinates
  　Collect Lost Railway Materials
    [This Dispatch] In order to rapidly repair railways on all lines, to guarantee transportation, develop production, and support the national liberation war, the Chinese People's Revolutionary Military Commission previously ordered all railway bureaus under its jurisdiction to systematically and responsibly collect all kinds of materials related to railway construction abandoned along the railway lines, and to centrally inspect, register, and store them for application. To assist in the progress of this work, the North China People's Government issued an order on May 31st to all administrative offices, provincial and municipal governments, instructing them to direct people's governments at all levels along the railway lines to mobilize the masses to actively collect such lost railway materials as steel rails, wheels, locomotives, boilers, various large and small parts, damaged steel, etc., and to immediately transport them to the nearest station or track maintenance point for acceptance. The required transportation and other expenses shall be paid by the local railway bureau stations according to regulations. (Yan)
