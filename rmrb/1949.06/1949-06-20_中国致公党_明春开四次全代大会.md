China Zhi Gong Party
	To Hold Fourth National Congress Next Spring

	[Ping City News] The China Zhi Gong Party has decided to convene its Fourth National Congress in the spring of next year. The meeting will discuss how overseas Chinese should unite to participate in the great construction of the New Democratic New China. As the party is an overseas Chinese political party, with most of its members residing in the United States and the Nanyang region, preparations for the congress will require a relatively long period. It is also learned that the party's central headquarters will soon move to the country, and its central organ publication, "Public Opinion," is currently still being published in Hong Kong.

　　中国致公党
  　明春开四次全代大会
    【平市讯】中国致公党决定于明年春季召开第四次全国代表大会。会上将讨论华侨应如何团结一致参加新民主主义新中国的伟大建设事业。该党系海外华侨政党，党员大多侨居美国及南洋一带，因之，大会筹备工作将需要较长时间。并悉：该党中央党部不久即将迁入国内，其中央机关刊物“公论”现仍在香港继续出版。
