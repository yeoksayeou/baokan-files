Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, 28th: The various takeover tasks in Qingdao City are proceeding smoothly, and the major production activities are rapidly recovering. In the past twenty days, the Qingdao Military Control Commission has taken over more than 200 units, including original Kuomintang party, government, and military affiliated agencies, factories, and schools. Among them, the major enterprise agencies include the Qingdao Branch of the China Textile Construction Corporation, Qilu Company, Qingdao Shipyard, Sifang Machine Factory, as well as power plants, water companies, post offices, telecommunications bureaus, and the Central Bank. The major cultural and health institutions include Qingdao Broadcasting Station, Shandong University, Observatory, Aquarium, and the Municipal Hospital. During the takeover process, the Military Control Commission correctly implemented the Chinese Communist Party's urban policies and, based on the takeover experiences of other cities, ensured that the original enterprise structures were not disrupted and that the takeover was carried out in a systematic and orderly manner. Because the Military Control Commission firmly grasped the principle of "taking over on the one hand and restoring production on the other," many of the enterprises that were taken over quickly resumed production. The Qingdao Power Plant restored power supply on the night of liberation. The water plant repaired 81 water pipes in four days, ensuring smooth water supply throughout the city. Postal, telecommunications, and telegraph services resumed operation six days ago. Communications have been restored with more than one hundred cities, including Shanghai, Beiping, and Changchun. The Jiaoji Railway is being repaired, and the Qingdao to Chengyang and Nanquan sections are already open to traffic. Road transport can directly reach Weixian, Yantai, and other places. The port is also rapidly opening, and shipping has resumed with the ports of Tianjin and Shanghai. In addition, most factories such as the China Textile Qingdao Branch, Qilu Company, and Qingdao Shipyard have resumed production. Large quantities of grain, oil, coal, and industrial raw materials such as cotton are continuously being supplied to Qingdao City. To solve the livelihood difficulties of employees in state-owned enterprises, the Military Control Commission has decided to provide advance wage payments and subsidized grain rations.
