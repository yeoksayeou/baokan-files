Taihang Fifth Prefectural Committee Calls for
    Swift Mobilization to Protect Wheat
  　Covert Bandits in Xinxiang Stir Up Trouble and Rob
    [Taihang News] The Taihang Fifth Prefectural Committee Office recently issued a circular on wheat protection, stating: During this tense wheat harvesting season, several counties have experienced incidents of wheat fields being burned. For example, in Lijiawan, Third District of Tangyin, fifteen mu were burned; in Daxin Village, Fifth District, eight mu were burned; and in Caiyuan Town, twenty-five mu were burned. In Qi County, three or four similar incidents occurred. The above events show that enemy agents and reactionaries are deliberately and systematically sabotaging our wheat harvest, while some of our county and district leaders have shown signs of complacency. The following suggestions are now put forward, and it is hoped that all counties will implement them quickly and effectively: 1. For the incidents of wheat burning that have already occurred, mobilize the affected households and the masses to investigate and solve the cases, and deal with them according to the law based on the circumstances. 2. Use the lessons of these incidents to educate the masses, overcome the complacency of cadres and the masses, and raise vigilance. Closely monitor and control enemy and puppet personnel and escaped landlords who have been registered and investigated, and force them to work to achieve the purpose of reforming them. 3. Organize the masses to guard the wheat fields and patrol at night, and mobilize the masses to inform and expose any enemy and puppet personnel and escaped landlords hiding in the villages.
    [Taihang Electric Dispatch]: In the Third and Fourth Districts of Xinxiang, scattered bandits hiding in various places, colluding with local lawless landlords, rich peasants, and secret agents, are robbing the masses of wheat, disrupting production, and disturbing social order. On May 20th, a child in Xiaoji Town was watching wheat in the field when several unfamiliar people suddenly rushed into the field, knocked the child over, and cut the wheat. In Dazhaoying, Dongying, Beizhaipo, and other villages in the Third District, six mu of wheat were robbed overnight. In the entire district, as many as thirty-five mu of wheat were robbed in just the fourth and fifth days of the month. The leadership of the county has now paid attention to this and is urgently mobilizing the masses to eliminate scattered bandits and protect the wheat harvest.

　　太行五地委号召
    迅速动员护麦
  　新乡潜匪蠢动抢劫
    【太行讯】太行五地委办公室顷发出护麦通报称：正在麦收紧张的时期，几个县连续发生烧毁麦场的事件，如汤阴三区李家湾被烧毁十五亩，五区大辛村被烧毁八亩，菜园镇被烧毁二十五亩。淇县亦连续发生三、四起，以上事件说明了敌特反动分子是有计划有准备的破坏我们的麦收；而我各县区领导上有些表现麻痹。现再提出以下意见，希各县迅速有效的加以执行：一、对已发生的烧麦事件，发动被灾户及群众侦察破案，根据情况依法处办。二、以此事件的教训教育群众，克服干部群众的麻痹思想，提高警惕，对已登记清查出之敌伪人员、逃亡地主要分别监视管制，强迫其劳动，以达到改造的目的。三、组织群众看麦场、巡夜，对村中潜伏之敌伪人员及逃亡地主发动群众告密、检举。
    【太行电】：新乡三、四区发现潜藏各地之散匪，结合当地不法地富、特务分子，抢劫群众麦子，破坏生产，捣乱社会秩序。上月二十日，小冀镇某户一小孩在地里看麦，突有几个相貌不熟的人窜到地里，将小孩打翻，把麦子割去。三区大召营、东营、北寨坡等村，一夜即被匪特抢割麦子六亩。全区在四、五两日内即被抢割麦子三十五亩之多。现该县领导上已引起注意，紧急动员群众肃清散匪，保卫麦收。
