　　Cherishing the People's Millet
 　——A Record of the Peking National University Students' Evaluation of People's Bursaries
    Jin Feng
    The students of Peking National Peking University, Tsinghua University, and Art Academy have concluded their half-month-long discussion and evaluation of the People's Bursaries. The evaluation results are now being sent to the Higher Education Committee for final review. According to statistics from the student unions of the three schools: based on the current number of students in school, each person receives 80 catties of millet per month for living expenses. Due to 25% of the students giving up applying for the People's Bursary, 76,638 catties of millet can be saved each month in the future. Among them, Tsinghua waived 38,977 catties, Peking University waived 32,971 catties, and the Art Academy waived 4,681 catties.

    Their evaluation of the People's Bursaries was a serious process of self-education, reflecting the profound changes in social relations before and after liberation.

    Before liberation, students in these three national schools had "public funds," and some were also allocated flour. The Kuomintang vainly attempted to buy people's hearts with these small things, but the students in Beiping were very clear-headed. For the liberation of the Chinese people, they still served as the vanguard of the people's democratic movement in the KMT-controlled areas. Neither cavalry, military police, nor machine guns could make them submit. After liberation, they saw that the People's Liberation Army and working cadres were still living a hard life for the people. Especially when they saw that the lives of the classmates who had joined the work were simple clothes made of homespun cloth and two meals of millet a day, they were all willing to eat the millet and sorghum issued by the People's Government.

    The People's Government fully trusts these students: The Cultural Management Committee allowed the students of each school to discuss the method of allocating public funds in the future very early on. The conclusion reached by Peking University students was: "Today's public funds have fundamentally changed in essence—in the past, we were biting the reactionary faction's lifeline, but today we are eating the blood and sweat of the people. Therefore, public funds should be renamed People's Bursaries, and they should be issued according to each person's needs and specific conditions in different grades and standards. It cannot be a casual distribution to everyone." Students from Tsinghua and the Art Academy also agreed to this proposal. The opinions were concentrated to the Ministry of Education of the Cultural Management Committee and then transferred down to the students of each school for evaluation.

    The evaluation was carried out in three levels: groups, departments, and school evaluation. In the group, a discussion was first launched on the nature and significance of the People's Bursaries, clarifying the idea of some students who simply believed that "application is my right." Then, the standards for application and whether each person should apply and what grade they should apply for were discussed. In the evaluation, each school created many methods: some had the person attend the group evaluation to state their family situation and sources of income; some submitted written reports to the group and department level for evaluation; some used anonymous votes to exchange written opinions; some two people jointly applied for A and B bursaries and used them to regulate each other. The evaluation ran through criticisms and self-criticisms of individual daily lifestyle and learning attitudes. If there were unreasonable or unfair applications, they were brought up face to face. Students have gradually developed a serious attitude of being responsible to the people and not being afraid of hurting feelings. Naturally, the ideological opening during the evaluation came step by step. A common situation was: news about drought prevention and disaster relief, and saving for famine preparedness in the People's Daily was being read, and students from rural areas told of the hard work and perseverance of the farmers; many people reminded everyone not to forget the great march into Jiangnan—millions of People's Liberation Army soldiers needed more and more urgent supplies of food and ammunition from the rear; and many people said that they should save every penny to prepare for the construction of the people's new country. After such ideological mobilization, the students' feelings gradually merged together, their reason gradually became clear, and naturally, fairly and reasonably, many people gave up applying. One female student had only one mother at home, who lived on the money she had saved when she was an elementary school teacher. She originally had public funds and gave up applying this time. She said: "I still have some flour, clothes, and a little jewelry. In that man-eating society before, I had to hold on to these things to guard against accidents. Now, it is the society of the People's Government, and I dare to deal with my things with peace of mind. When the savings are used up, I will be graduating, and if it is still not enough, I can apply at that time. It is also necessary to save a few months of millet for the public now." These types of examples undoubtedly encouraged many people, especially those who were still hesitant. A student nicknamed "Glass Toothbrush" (meaning stingy) who originally wanted to apply, underwent a drastic ideological change because of this, gave up applying, and also wrote down his inner struggle experience, heavily criticizing his past selfishness. This repeated mutual influence stimulated more people and educated more people. More people withdrew their applications, more people lowered their application grades, many people figured it out, sold unnecessary things, and sold commemorative luxury goods such as gold rings and gold jewelry. In this way, the evaluation of bursaries gradually deepened, gradually became realistic and fair, and the slogan of "saving wealth for the people" gradually became a reality.

    But naturally, some biases and shortcomings still existed: for example, some activists insisted that they were more hardworking than others, and a student who had no support and was suffering from lung disease insisted on applying for Grade B, which had to be fairly blocked by classmates. In addition, some students still could not overcome the issue of face-saving and casually passed the applications of others, so that some had raised the standards. But these mostly existed during the group evaluation, and were gradually overcome as they were evaluated level by level.

    After this evaluation, the students were closer and more understanding of each other. Because of each person's statement about their family and economic situation, they learned that a classmate who never participated in collective activities had to go to the telecommunications bureau to work part-time every day to support his mother, which made everyone never blame his aloofness again, but became closer to him. They also learned that a sick father at home who lived by pawning belongings told his son to give up applying; they also learned that a certain classmate ran from the east of the city to the west of the city every day to eat in order not to apply; and they also learned that a classmate who loved to read alone in the room did not want to be close to everyone, but that everyone did not go to him. The discovery of these lovely little stories often made everyone respect and get closer to each other from then on, thereby helping each other to progress.

    The slogan "Being responsible to the people" has been deeply discussed and its content has been enriched. The students proposed: "Since we don't waste a grain of millet from the people, let alone waste a minute or a second, we must study harder!" They also proposed: "Not only should we do well in our studies, but we must also exercise our bodies well!"

    Tsinghua University launched a cramming movement, and more and more people borrowed books from the Jiemin Library of Peking University.

　　爱惜人民的小米
  　——记北平国立大学学生评议人民助学金
    金凤
    北平国立北京大学、清华大学、艺术专科学校学生经过半月来的关于人民助学金的讨论和评议，现在已经告一结束，评议结果正送高等教育委员会作最后的审核。根据三校学生会的统计：按现在在校人数每人每月所领维持费八十斤小米算，因有百分之二十五的学生放弃申请人民助学金，今后每月能节省下小米七万六千六百三十八斤。其中清华免领三万八千九百七十七斤，北大免领三万二千九百七十一斤，艺专免领四千六百八十一斤。
    他们评议人民助学金的过程是一个严肃的自我教育的过程，反映出解放前后社会关系的深刻变化。
    解放前，这三个国立学校的学生有“公费”，也有一些配给面粉。国民党妄想用这一点点东西来收买人心，但是，北平的学生很清醒，他们为着中国人民的解放，仍旧充当着国统区人民民主运动的先锋，马队、宪警、机关枪都不能使他们屈服。解放后，他们看到人民解放军和工作干部为着人民，依旧过着艰苦生活，尤其看到参加了工作的同学的生活是一身土布衣，两顿小米饭时，他们都心甘情愿地吃着人民政府所发给的小米和高粱了。
    人民政府是充分信任着这些学生的：文管会很早就让各校学生自己讨论今后拨发公费的办法。北大学生得出的结论是：“今日的公费，本质已经根本改变——过去我们是咬反动派的命根，今天则是吃的人民的血汗，因此公费应改名人民助学金，按每人的需要及具体条件分等第定标准来发给，不能随随便便每人一份。”清华、艺专的学生也同意这个提议。意见集中到了文管会的教育部，又转下来让各校学生来评议。
    评议是分为小组、系级和校评议三级来进行的。小组中先展开关于人民助学金的性质和意义的讨论，澄清了一部分学生单纯认为“申请是我的权利”的想法。然后再讨论申请的标准和每个人应不应该申请和应申请什么等级。评议中，各校创造了很多的方式：有的是小组评议时本人出席申述自己的家庭状况及经济来源；有的则以书面报告提请小组、系级评议；有的在评议时彼此用不记名投票互提书面意见；有的两人联合申请甲、乙两种助学金，互相调剂使用。评议中贯穿了对于个人平日的生活作风、学习态度的批评与自我批评，有申请得不合理不公平的地方，就当面提了出来，学生们已渐渐具有了对人民负责、不怕伤情面的严肃态度。自然，评议时思想的打通是一步步来的。有这样一种常见的情形：人民日报上防旱救灾、节约备荒的新闻被朗读着，家在乡下的学生则诉说着农民的辛劳和刻苦；许多人又提醒着大家不要忘记了江南的大进军——几百万解放大军需要后方更多与更急迫的粮食和弹药的供应；又有许多人说到了要节省下每一个铜板来准备建设人民的新国家。经过了这样的思想动员，慢慢地，学生们的感情溶合在一起，理智一点点地清明，自然而然地，公平合理地，许多人放弃了申请。有一个女学生家里只有一个母亲，靠着她以前当小学教员时积蓄下来的一点钱过活，她原有公费，这次也放弃申请。她说：“我还有一些面粉、衣服、和一点首饰。在以前那种吃人的社会里，我不能不抓着这些防备不测。如今，是人民政府的社会了，我敢于放心处理我的这点东西。等积蓄用完了，我也将要毕业了，再不够时，到那时我还可以申请。现在能给公家多节省下几个月的小米也是必要的。”这类例子，无疑地是鼓舞了很多的人，尤其是那些还在犹疑彷徨的人。有一个原想申请的绰号叫做“玻璃牙刷”（意即一毛不拔）的学生，就因此起了激烈的思想变化，放弃了申请，还把他自己内心斗争的经历写了出来，重重地批判了自己过去的自私自利。这样反复地互相影响，激发了更多的人，教育了更多的人，更多的人撤销了申请，更多的人降低了申请等级，很多的人想开了，把不必要的东西卖掉，把有纪念性的奢侈品金戒指、金首饰等卖掉。就这样，评议助学金的工作逐步深入，逐步做到实事求是，公平合理，“为人民节省财富”的口号逐步成为事实。
    但也自然，一些偏向及缺点还是有的：如一部分积极分子一定要固执他们比别人更为刻苦，一个一点接济也没有、还生着肺病的学生坚持要申请乙种，这就不能不受到同学公正的阻拦。另外，又有一些学生还破除不了情面，随随便便地给别人通过申请，以致有的曾把标准提高了。但这些多半是在小组评议时存在着的，慢慢地一级级评议上去时，就逐渐克服了。
    经过这次评议，学生们彼此是更为靠近，更为了解了。由于每个人关于家庭以及自己经济状况的申述，才知道了一个向不参加集体活动的同学原来每天要上电信局去兼差养活他的母亲，这就使大家绝不会再责怪他的孤僻，而更靠近他起来。又知道了一个家里靠典当过日子的病父亲还叫儿子放弃申请；又知道了某一同学为着不申请而天天从东城跑到西城去吃饭，又知道了一个爱关在屋里独自读书的同学并非不愿与大家接近，而是大家不去找他。这些可爱的小故事的发现，常常使大家从此更相尊重，更相亲近起来，从而互相帮助进步。
    “对人民负责”的口号，经过了深入的讨论，又丰富了它的内容，学生们提出：“既然我们不浪费人民的一粒小米，更不要浪费一分一秒的时间，我们要加紧学习！”又提出：“不仅要搞好功课，而且要锻炼好身体！”
    清华大学展开了温书运动，北京大学孑民图书室借书的人是越发多了。
