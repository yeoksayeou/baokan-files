　　Rural Cooperatives in the Taihang Area
　　·Taihang Branch·
    The Taihang area is adopting a policy of transforming existing rural cooperatives, aiming to make these cooperatives play a role in organizing production and promoting production through transformation. Since the beginning of spring, various localities have been implementing this policy, and some have achieved significant results. Based on a synthesis of materials from various locations, two initial lessons have been learned:

    1. A correct assessment must be made of existing rural cooperatives, and they must be transformed according to their specific circumstances. Rejecting them outright would be a detachment from the masses. Cooperative organizations are relatively widespread in the Taihang area (out of 7,950 villages in the area, 5,600 have village cooperatives, 160 have district-level federations, and 32 have county-level federations – statistics from April of this year). Over the years, they have played a significant role in helping farmers through famines and facilitating the exchange of goods. However, due to errors and biases that arose during their development, such as a focus solely on profit-sharing and a failure to reduce intermediate exploitation for members, most cooperatives had become detached from the masses and were on the verge of collapse by last year, except for a few better-run ones. After rectification last autumn, some cooperatives did make effective improvements. To this day, a considerable proportion of cooperatives in the area still have the correct direction, maintain contact with their members, and are supported by them, becoming indispensable organizations for the lives and production of their members, providing favorable conditions for the transformation work. As for those cooperatives that are maintaining the status quo or are difficult to sustain, they also have conditions for transformation. The question is how to make efforts subjectively. Yuci County formulated specific guidelines for the transformation of village cooperatives based on this spirit. The county has a total of sixty-five village cooperatives, which, according to analysis, are roughly divided into three categories. The first category is those with a relatively solid foundation, capable of engaging in some supply and marketing business, and maintaining contact with their members, numbering nineteen. The transformation guideline is to further clarify the view of serving members and engage in supply and marketing business in a planned manner. The second category is those that are maintaining the status quo, numbering twenty-nine. Although their turnover capacity is not large, the difficulties are not great either. The transformation guideline is to gradually engage in the business of selling products and supplying necessities to members under possible conditions, seeking business transformation through practical actions, overcoming extravagance and waste, and ensuring that personnel are assigned according to tasks. The third category is those that are difficult to sustain, numbering seventeen, with more difficulties. However, efforts should also be made to change the business, engage in some supply and marketing business, doing as much as possible, and streamlining the internal personnel as much as possible.

    2. Facts have proved that changing the business to serve the current production of members is an effective way to transform cooperatives. Since the beginning of spring, many cooperatives have actively served the spring plowing production of their members, solving the difficulties of members in seeds, fertilizers, and agricultural tools, and supplying members with daily necessities. Through these practical actions, they have been linked to members in production and life. This has changed the past practice of purely seeking profit and deviating from the actual needs of members. Not only has it gained the support of members, but the cooperatives themselves also feel that they have a future. Shangyuan Village Cooperative in Wuxiang and Tancun Village Cooperative in Yuci are two good examples. Shangyuan Village Cooperative (out of 163 households in the village, only 4 have not invested) used to focus on relying on profit-sharing. This spring, it is fully serving the production of its members. The cooperative has a water mill, which milled 30 shi and 1 dou of coarse grains for the members during the spring plowing, saving 85 laborers and 100 animal power compared to members using dry mills themselves. The labor saved was used by the village cadres to lead the opening of five small canals, which immediately irrigated more than 200 mu of land. Although the weather was extremely dry, all 200 mu of land were captured by the seedlings. The cooperative had a portion of grain reserves, which were loaned to members at 27 shi and 4 dou, solving the spring famine of the members. Before planting, 2 shi of high-quality grain seeds and 2 dou and 6 sheng of hemp seeds were exchanged from the back mountain area to adjust the seeds for the members. During the rush planting, ten kinds of daily necessities such as salt, cotton, and pipe tobacco were supplied to the members in a timely manner, saving everyone from going to distant markets, saving a total of 3,199 yuan in Renminbi compared to market prices. The cooperative has a shop with more than 1,000 dan of accumulated manure; an oil mill with 400 hemp cakes (equivalent to 2,000 dan of manure); and 80 sheep with 3,000 dan of manure accumulated. A total of 6,000 dan of various manures were supplied to the members, and each mu of the members' autumn land of more than 2,000 mu could increase manure by 3 dan. The members reflected, "It is much better than profit-sharing in the past." Tancun Cooperative used to be purely for profit. This spring, it changed its business in helping members produce. In April and May, it supplied members with 400 jin of cotton, 500 jin of salt, and 640 iron plows. After the wheat seedlings were frozen to death, the members wanted to rush to plant autumn millet, but they had no fertilizer. The cooperative lent out 5 shi and 6 dou of wheat, so that 15 member households could use sheep to fertilize the land. Recently, it also entrusted the county cooperative to sell 30 plows to the members. The above items were all lower than the market price. The members all said, "This year, the cooperative can take care of major issues." The internal cadres also said, "When the cooperative was established in 1944, it was mainly for profit-sharing, and it was always not doing well. Since last year, we have paid attention to opposing pure profit-seeking, but we did not know what was correct. Now we are starting to find the direction."

    From the current point of view, there are still two problems to be solved urgently in the transformation of village cooperatives. One is that many village cooperatives do not yet have the concept of serving members, and there is no distinction between members and non-members, still serving all the villagers in general (using the funds of a few members to serve all the villagers), so members do not cherish the cooperatives, and there is even a phenomenon of withdrawing shares. If this problem is not overcome quickly, it will affect the transformation and development of the cooperatives. The second is that the village cooperatives are still isolated and circling around in one village, and have not yet established contact with the county federations and state-owned trade organizations. Therefore, they have short legs and few connections, and they have encountered many difficulties in both supply and sales, and they still cannot avoid the intermediate exploitation of private merchants. The county federations also cannot take the initiative to solve the difficulties for the village cooperatives. The county cooperatives and village cooperatives urgently need to communicate, but the county cooperatives themselves cannot yet adapt to this requirement. Therefore, recently, leaders at all levels above the county are focusing on the transformation of the county cooperatives, in order to truly be able to lead the village cooperatives economically.

　　太行区的农村合作社
    ·太行分社·
    太行区对于现有的农村合作社，是采取改造的方针，要使这些合作社经过改造，能起组织生产，推动生产的作用。在改造的办法上提出：要在为社员生产服务中改变业务。入春以来，各地都在贯彻这个方针，有的地方已有显著成绩。综合各地材料，初步获得两点经验：
    一、对于现有农村合作社必须作正确的估价，分别情况予以改造，一脚踢开是会脱离群众的。太行合作社组织较为普遍（全区七千九百五十个村，有五千六百个村社，一百六十个区联社，三十二个县联社——今年四月统计），历年来在扶助农民生产渡荒、交流物资上起了巨大作用。但由于在发展中产生了单纯分红单纯营利，不为社员减少中间剥削的错误与偏向。因而发展至去年，除少数较好的合作社以外，大部合作社就脱离了群众，频于垮台。经过去秋整顿，部分合作社确实作了有效的改进，至今，全区方向正确，与社员有联系，为社员所拥护的合作社还占相当比重，已成为社员生活与生产上不可缺少的组织，给改造工作具备了有利的条件。至于那些维持现状与难以维持的合作社，也还有其改造的条件，问题是在于主观上如何加以努力。榆社县即是根据这个精神定出了关于村社改造的具体方针。该县共有六十五个村社，根据分析，大致分为三类。第一类是较有基础，能从事一些供销业务，与社员有联系的有十九个，改造方针是：更加明确为社员服务的观点，有计划的从事供销业务。第二类是维持现状的有二十九个，周转力虽然不大，但困难也不大，改造方针是：在可能条件下，逐渐从事给社员推销产品供给必需品的业务，在实际行动中求得业务的转变，克服铺张浪费，做到按事设人。第三类是难以维持的有十七个，困难较多；但也应从改变业务入手，从事一些供销业务，能做多少就多少，社内人员尽量精简。
    二、事实证明，在为社员当前生产服务中改变业务，是改造合作社的有效办法。入春以来，不少合作社积极为社员春耕生产服务，解决社员种籽、肥料、农具等困难，供给社员日用必需品。经过这些实际行动，与社员在生产上生活上联系起来了。改变了过去那种单纯营利，脱离社员实际需要的做法，不但取得了社员拥护，合作社本身也感到有了前途。武乡尚元村社，榆社潭村村社，就是较好的两个例子。尚元村社（全村一百六十三户，只有四户未入股）过去是以靠营利分红为主，今春全力为社员生产服务。社内有水磨一盘，春耕中给社员磨了杂粮三十石零一斗，比社员自己用旱磨节省人工八十五个，畜力一百个。省下的工由村干部领导开了五道小渠，马上就浇了地二百余亩；虽然天气亢旱，这二百余亩地却全部捉住了小苗。该社有一部分存粮，贷给社员二十七石四斗，解决社员春荒。下种前，到后山一带换回优良谷籽二石，麻籽二斗六升，给社员调剂了种籽。在抢种中，及时供给了社员食盐、棉花、水烟等十种日用必需品，省下大家去远处赶集，比市价共省人民币三千一百九十九元。该社有店房一座，积有粪一千余担；有油房一座，积有麻饼四百块（顶粪二千担）；有羊八十只，积粪三千担，各种粪共有六千担，全部供给了社员，社员秋地二千余亩每亩可增粪三担。社员反映说：“比过去分红强的多”。潭村合作社，过去是单纯营利，今春在扶助社员生产中转变了业务。四、五两个月，共供给社员棉花四百斤，食盐五百斤，铁铧（农具）六百四十口。麦苗冻死后，社员想赶种秋禾，但没肥料，合作社借出麦子五石六斗，使十五户社员卧了地（羊卧地）。最近又托县社卖给社员犁三十个。上述物品均比市价低。社员都说：“今年合作社可顶上大事啦”。社内干部也说：“一九四四年成立合作社时，主要是为了营利分红，总是搞不好；去年以来注意了反对单纯营利，但不知怎样才是正确的，现在算开始摸住方向啦。”
    从目前来看，村社改造尚有两个问题急待解决。一是好些村社还没有为社员服务的观念，社员非社员不分，还是笼统的为全村群众服务（以少数社员资金，为全村人服务），因而社员对合作社不加爱护，甚至还有抽股的现象。这一问题如不迅速克服，将会影响合作社的改造与发展。二是村社还是孤立地钻在一个村子裹兜圈子，还未与县联社与国营贸易机关取得联系。因而腿短门路少，供与销都遇到了不少困难，还不能避免私商的中间剥削。县联社也还不能主动的来给村社解决困难。县社与村社急须通气，但县社本身当下还不能适应这一要求。因此最近县以上各级领导，正致力于县社的改造，以求真正能够在经济上领导村社。
