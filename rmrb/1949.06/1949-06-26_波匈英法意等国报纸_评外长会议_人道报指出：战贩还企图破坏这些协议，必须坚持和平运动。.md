Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 25th -- According to the Polish Press Agency: Polish, Hungarian, British, French, and Italian newspapers have successively published articles commenting on the results of the Paris Foreign Ministers' Conference.

The Warsaw People's Forum wrote: Although opposition from the United States and Britain made it impossible to reach an agreement on the fundamental issue of Germany, the Foreign Ministers' Conference still demonstrated a willingness to continue efforts to reach such an agreement. Although the results of the Paris negotiations do not fully meet the expectations of the working masses around the world, these results are still a decisive defeat for those reactionaries and war vendors who are trying to spread pessimism. The reason why the conference was able to achieve these limited but indeed positive results is primarily due to the efforts of the Soviet government. The Western countries, which brought the Foreign Ministers' Conference to a halt more than a year ago, have been forced to return, at least in part, to the Potsdam Agreement.

The Hungarian Workers' Party organ, Szabad Nép, stated: The several agreements reached at the Foreign Ministers' Conference "are the result of changes in the international balance of power in favor of the peace camp."

French reactionary newspapers have tried to diminish the importance of the Paris Conference, publishing grotesque commentaries in an attempt to convince readers of the need to continue the current policies of the Western countries and to ratify the North Atlantic Treaty. However, L'Humanité, while emphasizing the importance of the agreement on the Austrian issue, pointed out that war provocateurs will do everything possible to undermine the four-power agreement, which is why the peace movement must be continued.

British reactionary newspapers, while trying to reduce the importance of the Paris agreement, have reacted with satisfaction to the relaxation of the international situation. The Daily Telegraph wrote that the goals set at the beginning of the Paris Conference have been achieved. The Manchester Guardian, despite some reservations, also believes that the Paris Conference laid the foundation for achieving a complete agreement in the future.

The Italian newspaper Unità emphasized that the agreements reached at the Foreign Ministers' Conference dealt a major blow to the Italian reactionaries who constantly predicted the conference would be a miserable failure. Unità believes that the most positive outcome of the Paris Conference is the return to the procedures stipulated by the Yalta and Potsdam conferences, because the Western countries had tried to replace this procedure with "Atlantic solidarity."

　　波匈英法意等国报纸
  　评外长会议
    人道报指出：战贩还企图破坏这些协议，必须坚持和平运动。
    【新华社北平二十五日电】据波兰通讯社报道：波、匈、英、法、意报纸陆续著文，评论巴黎外长会议的结果。
    华沙人民论坛报写道：尽管有美英方面的反对，因而使德国的根本问题不可能达到协议，但是，外长会议仍然表明了愿意继续努力以达到这种协议的意向。虽然巴黎谈判的结果不完全符合全世界劳动群众的期望，但这些结果仍然是那些力图散布悲观空气的反动派和战争贩子的一个决定性的失败。会议所以能达到了这些有限的但的确是积极性的结果，那首先是由于苏联政府的努力。一年多以前使得外长会议停止活动的西方国家，已被迫至少是一部分地回到波茨坦协议。
    匈牙利工人党机关报萨巴德·涅普报称：外长会议所得到的若干协议，“是国际力量对比有利于和平阵营变化的结果。”
    法国的反动报纸，试图减低巴黎会议的重要性，它们刊登若干怪诞的评论，想使读者相信有必要继续执行西方国家目前的政策，并批准北大西洋公约。但是，人道报则一方面强调在奥国问题上协议的重要性，同时指出，战争挑拨者将尽一切可能破坏四国协议，这就是为什么必须继续和平运动的原因。
    英国反动报纸的评论，虽然试图减少巴黎协议的重要性，然而，对国际形势的缓和，它们的反应是表示满意的。每日电讯报写道，在巴黎会议开始时所提出的目标业已达到。曼彻斯特卫报尽管有若干的保留，然而，该报也认为巴黎会议给将来获致完全的协议奠定了基础。
    意大利团结报着重指出，外长会议获致的协议，给那些不断地预告会议行将惨败的意大利反动派以重大的打击。团结报认为，巴黎会议最积极的成果，是回到雅尔塔与波茨坦会议所规定的程序，因为，西方国家曾经试图以“大西洋团结一致”来代替这一程序。
