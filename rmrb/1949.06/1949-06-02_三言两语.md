　　A Few Words
  　Agricultural Technicians Go to the Countryside
    When cattle plague occurred in Chahar, the People's Government organized veterinarians from the city to go and treat the cattle, which quickly extinguished the serious epidemic in Chahar. Now, insect pests have been discovered in many areas of North China, and Shijiazhuang City has begun to organize agricultural technicians to go to the countryside to eliminate the insect pests. This is a good example of mutual assistance between urban and rural areas, the combination of technology and practice, and increased production, which is worth greatly advocating and promoting. We hope that all agricultural experts and technicians who go to the countryside should give full play to their expertise, contribute their wisdom and scientific knowledge, and work diligently to ensure the completion of the agricultural production plan.
  　The Brilliant Result of School Regularization
    The enrollment of 3.25 million children in North China is mainly due to the People's Government's emphasis on people's cultural education, overcoming all biases in primary school education, and implementing school regularization. Because the school has implemented regularization, enrolled children can truly learn culture, increase knowledge, learn to obey rules, and understand principles, which further promotes the enthusiasm of parents to send their children to school. There are now many newly liberated areas in North China. Under the rule of the Kuomintang bandit gang, school construction has been greatly destroyed. We hope to continue our efforts to eliminate illiteracy and mobilize all school-age children to enroll in school.

　　三言两语
  　农业技术干部下乡
    察北发生牛瘟时，人民政府曾组织了城市里的兽医人员前往救治，使严重的察北疫情迅速扑灭。现在华北许多地区又发现了虫害，石家庄市已开始组织农业技术干部下乡，扑灭虫灾。这是城乡互济，技术与实际结合，增加生产的好榜样，值得大大提倡推广。我们希望所有下乡的农业专家和技术家们，应该发挥自己的专长，把自己的智慧与科学知识贡献出来，勤勤恳恳为保证农业生产计划的完成而努力工作。
  　学校正规化的光辉结果
    华北三百二十五万儿童入学，这一成绩的获得，主要是人民政府重视人民文化教育，克服了小学教育工作中一切偏向，实行了学校正规化的结果。由于学校实行了正规化，入学儿童真正学得到文化、增加知识、学会守规矩，懂道理，也就更加促使家长们送自己的子弟入学的热情。华北现在有很多新解放区，在国民党匪帮统治下学校建设受了极大摧残，希望继续努力，消灭文盲，动员一切学龄儿童入学。
