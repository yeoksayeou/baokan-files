　　Obtain Experience and Promote Factory Hygiene
      Li Zhizhong
    To carry out factory hygiene, pay attention to labor protection, and gradually establish a social insurance system is a brand-new task. Whether it is the bureaucratic capitalist enterprises that have been taken over, or private capitalist enterprises, although they may have hospitals, clinics, outpatient departments, or sanatoriums with an air of charity, most of them only treat workers after injuries and illnesses, and rarely pay attention to pre-illness health care and prevention work. Or, some have tried to run "factory hygiene," but they often just moved the articles of foreign textbooks and rarely solved, and could not solve, the health problems of Chinese workers. In this regard, we are very lacking in experience.
    Today, major cities have been successively liberated. Seriously organizing factory hygiene and effectively achieving the prevention of infectious diseases, reducing workplace disasters and occupational diseases is not only a very important task, but also an urgent task.
    However, under the tasks of supporting the front lines, developing production, and building a new China, economic conditions do not yet allow us to do everything at once in factory hygiene. Carrying out factory hygiene is for the sake of increasing production and for the welfare of workers. It is impossible to carry it out under conditions that exceed what the factory can afford today, so as not to ruin the factory. At the same time, there are not enough technical personnel, and the general workers, trade unions, and factories are still unfamiliar with this work. In particular, there is no experience in promoting this work. Therefore, we should promote this difficult and arduous task gradually and in a step-by-step manner. Medical and health circles with aspirations for this work should estimate these situations, seek truth from facts, and first try to run one or two factories to gain experience for promotion.
    Even in today's circumstances, we can still do the following work:
    First of all, the medical personnel originally in the factory should change from passively seeing patients to going deep into the workshops to study the relationship between the working environment, various special operations, and health, regularly conduct physical examinations, correct shortcomings, count diseases, study the causes of diseases, and constantly conduct health propaganda to improve the general workers' health knowledge. Through the trade union and the factory, carry out various hygiene movements (such as: cleaning movement, summer prevention of gastrointestinal infectious diseases movement). More importantly, solve the problems that are closely related to the workers and are easy to solve, and are related to health care: such as launching the establishment of employee food cooperatives (which can sell meal portions), possibly improving nutrition, solving fly prevention and food hygiene issues. Timely cholera and typhoid vaccination, and smallpox vaccination. In many workers at risk of trauma, tetanus toxoid injections are all important work that can be done today.
    Undoubtedly, this work requires the leadership of the factory and the management committee, and the trade union is responsible for promoting it. Doctors have the responsibility to plan and guide, and the factory and the trade union should also understand that only by reducing and even eliminating preventable diseases can production efficiency be further improved. The quality of factory hygiene depends on the degree of importance attached to it by the factory and the trade union.
    The above is only in terms of general factory hygiene. Other special factories (such as various chemical plants) still need further research on the prevention of occupational diseases and disasters, which still requires the efforts of the health community in the future.

### 取得经验推广工厂卫生

　　取得经验推广工厂卫生
      李志中
    开展工厂卫生，注意劳动保护，并逐步的建立社会保险制度，是一件崭新的工作。不管是接管了的官僚资本企业，不管是私人资本企业，过去虽或设有带施舍性的医院、医务所、门诊部或休养所，大多只作了职工伤病后的治疗，很少注意病前的保健及预防工作。或间有试办过“工厂卫生”的，但每每是搬了外国教科书的条文，很少解决，也解决不了中国工人的保健问题。在这方面，我们是非常缺乏经验的。
    今天各大城市相继解放了，认真的举办工厂卫生，切实达到预防传染病，减少工作中的灾害及职业病，不但是一件很重要的工作，而且是一件迫切的任务。
    但在支援前线，发展生产与建设新中国的任务下，经济条件还不允许我们百废俱举的搞工厂卫生。进行工厂卫生，是为了增产，是为了工人的福利，不可能在超乎今天厂方所能负担的条件下进行，以致搞垮工厂。同时技术的人力不够，一般职工及工会，厂方也还对这一工作生疏。特别还没有推动这方面的工作经验。因此，我们应将此项困难而艰巨的任务，有步骤的，逐渐的推行。有志于此项工作的医务卫生界，应估计这些情况，实事求是的先试办一两个工厂，取得经验，以求推广。
    即使在今天的这些情况下，我们还是可以作以下的工作：
    首先，原在工厂中的医务人员，应转变只消极的看病，而应深入到车间研究工作环境，各种特殊作业与健康的关系，定期的检查体格，矫治缺点，统计疾病，研究病因，不断作卫生宣传，提高一般职工的卫生常识，通过工会、厂方，进行各种卫生运动（如：清洁运动，夏季预防肠胃传染病运动）。更重要的是解决工人切身的，而易于解决，并有关保健的问题：如发动建立职工伙食团（可卖份饭），可能的改进营养，解决防蝇及饮食清洁卫生各项问题。及时的作霍乱、伤寒预防注射，种牛痘。在许多有外伤危险的工人中，注射破伤风类毒素，都是在今天可能办到，而有一般重要性的工作。
    这些工作无疑都要厂方及管理会领导，职工会负责推动。医生有责计划指导，而厂方及职工会亦应了解只有将可防的疾病减少以至消灭，才能进一步的提高生产效率，而工厂卫生之好坏，则要看厂方及职工会的重视的程度了。
    以上仅就一般的工厂卫生而言，其他特殊的工厂（如各种化学厂），尚须进一步的研究职业病与灾害的预防，这还有待于今后卫生界的努力。
