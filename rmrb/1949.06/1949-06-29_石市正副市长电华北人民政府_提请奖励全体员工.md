The Shijiazhuang Mayor and Deputy Mayor Telegraph North China People's Government
Requesting Awards for All Employees

[Our Newspaper's News] Shijiazhuang People's Government Mayor Liu and Deputy Mayor Zang requested the North China People's Government to reward all employees who completed the first phase of the Shijiazhuang-Tianjin Canal irrigation project. Today's letter and telegram stated: "The successful completion of the Shijiazhuang-Tianjin Canal irrigation ditch is of great significance to the development of agricultural production relations in Shijiazhuang. It is a great initiative for supplying urban raw materials, saving labor, increasing the reserve army for industrial production, and improving the economic life of urban and rural areas. This is entirely the result of the well-planned leadership of the North China People's Government and the hard work of all the comrades in the engineering department and nearby farmers. In order to further encourage them to continue to complete the second phase of the project, we specifically propose that the North China People's Government give a commendation to all comrades in the department and give appropriate merit-based rewards to those with special achievements."

[Our Newspaper's News] Chahar Province implemented the spirit of last year's North China Water Conservancy Conference and vigorously carried out water conservancy construction. Preparations were made last winter, and construction began immediately after the thaw this spring. By the end of May, the original plan had been exceeded. In the early days of liberation, large-scale water conservancy in the new district was once stagnant. The leadership announced that the original water conservancy organizations would generally remain unchanged and implemented a gradual transformation policy, stabilizing the morale of the original water conservancy workers. They focused on leading the rush repair and renovation projects, restoring and expanding the benefited area. In terms of canal excavation and beach repair, according to statistics from 41 counties in seven special districts of the province, the irrigated area has now been expanded by 295,835 mu. Among them, 427 new canals were opened, irrigating 148,789.8 mu, 356 old canals were restored and expanded, irrigating 136,924.2 mu, and 10,121 mu of beaches were opened and repaired, exceeding the original plan by nearly two times. The Yishui Special District exceeded the original plan by more than five times. According to statistics from 31 counties, a total of 9,309 brick and earth wells were dug (including 7,476 earth wells), and 2,116 old wells were repaired (including 73 earth wells). In terms of promoting water wheels, according to statistics from 25 counties, 2,647 new water wheels were installed, and 1,963 old water wheels were repaired, according to statistics from 17 counties. The above newly built and repaired wells can irrigate an average of 5 mu each, expanding the irrigated area by 57,125 mu. The original six large canals, namely Ji, San, Rongzhen, Guangji, Limin, Agriculture, and Dongsheng, are also planned to expand the irrigated area by 44,900 mu. The expansion and repair of these canals are currently being actively carried out. In total, the province's canals, beaches, wells, and water wheels combined, this year's expansion of irrigated area will be over 430,000 mu. More than 300,000 mu have already been watered, and another 100,000 mu are waiting for silt deposition during the rainy season. (Lü Guangming)
