(Ji Luyu Electric) The famous Xianzhuang straw hat braid production area, including Qingfeng, Nanle, Weihe, Guancheng, Puyang, Fanxian, Nanfeng and other seven counties in Ji Luyu, and Yuanchao County in the Jinnan District. The straw hat braids produced were once well-known in the world market. However, due to the backwardness of China's braid technology and the difficulty in improving quality, it has gradually declined. The current export volume is less than one-sixth of that before the war, and the selling price has also decreased by 95% compared with before the war. Before the war, half of the livelihood (that is, half of the harvest) of 200,000 people in the area depended on the straw braid industry. At that time, the braid price was the highest, and each woman who weaved braids could earn enough to buy a斗 (dǒu) of coarse grain per day. Although the trade company has supported it and increased the purchase price, the income is only one-tenth or two-tenths of what it was at its peak. In order to improve quality and increase sales under the existing raw materials and technical conditions, the leadership has researched and developed improvement suggestions. The specific requirements are that women who weave braids, braid workers, and braid selectors should be consistent in the selection and use of raw materials to improve the grade; the selection should be neat and the quality should be graded. Currently, various economic departments are deeply involved in leadership to seek practical improvements. Some areas have already achieved considerable results.

　　冀鲁豫仙庄草帽辫业正改进技术提高质量
    【冀鲁豫电】著名的仙庄草帽辫产区，包括冀鲁豫清丰、南乐、卫河、观城、濮阳、范县、南峰等七县，及冀南区的元朝县。所产草帽辫曾在世界市场上卓著声誉，但因我国辫业技术落后质量难于改进，以致渐趋不振，现在的出口量，尚不及战前的六分之一，售价亦较战前降低了百分之九十五。战前该区二十万群众的半个生活（即半个年景）依赖草辫业解决，当时辫价最高，每个掏辫妇女每日所得可买一斗粗粮，目前虽经贸易公司的扶持，提高了收购价格，其所得亦仅及盛时的十分之一、二。为在现有的原料和技术条件下提高质量，增进销路，领导上已研究出改进意见，具体的要求掏辫妇女挑辫工人和选辫工人在原料的选择使用上要划一，提高成色；挑选上要整齐，检定质量之优次等。现各经济部门分别深入领导，求切实提高，现若干地区已有相当成绩。
