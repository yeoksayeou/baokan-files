Xinhua News Agency, Prague, 15th: The latest issue of "For Lasting Peace, For People's Democracy" carries an article by János Kádár, Deputy General Secretary of the Hungarian Workers' Party (formerly translated as the Hungarian Working People's Party) Central Committee, titled "The Victory of the Hungarian People's Independence Front." The abstract is as follows:

May 15th—the day of the Hungarian general election—was a day when the Hungarian working people joyously expressed their unity around the Hungarian Workers' Party and the People's Independence Front.

The election results show a complete victory for democracy. Out of 6,053,972 voters, 5,730,519, or 94.6 percent, participated in the voting, 480,000 more than in the 1947 general election. Among them, 5,478,515, or 95.6 percent of the voters, voted for the People's Independence Front; 165,283, or 2.9 percent, voted against the People's Independence Front; and 86,721 votes, or slightly more than 1.5 percent, were invalidated.

These results were completely unexpected by the reactionaries. And it must be admitted that these results were even better than the Hungarian democrats had hoped for. In the working-class areas, the People's Independence Front won 98-99 percent of the vote. This political upsurge also reached a high level in the countryside. In many villages, 100 percent of the voters voted within two hours after the start of the voting. People in hundreds of villages unanimously voted for the candidates of the People's Independence Front.

At the beginning of the election campaign, the Hungarian Workers' Party and the People's Independence Front, which unites the democratic forces of Hungary, called on voters to actively participate in the election to express their support for the work that the party has done to strengthen Hungarian democracy, and to express their support for the Five-Year Plan and the party's and the People's Independence Front's foreign policy—a policy aimed at joining the Soviet Union in opposing the imperialist war plans and ensuring lasting peace for mankind and the Hungarian people. In the election, this program achieved victory.

With the fraternal assistance of the Soviet people, the Hungarian working people have restored the national economy destroyed by the fascists. Living conditions have improved. The Three-Year Plan is being successfully implemented and will be completed seven months ahead of schedule. Even those bourgeois newspapers that commented on the election admitted—even reluctantly—these achievements. The French Foreign Ministry's semi-official newspaper, "Le Monde," wrote in its commentary on the election: "The key to the election is the Five-Year Plan," "which encompasses all sectors of economic, scientific and spiritual life, and everyone in Hungary is concerned about its realization." The Hungarian democratic state led by the Workers' Party has a constructive program and also has the strength to implement it. If the reactionaries—from Nagy to Barankovics and Béja—had their program implemented, it would mean suffering for the people and the destruction of the country. That is why it was easy for our voters to decide who to vote for.

The results of the election also show that the middle peasants, women, and youth have been firmly won over to the democratic united front. Since the establishment of the united Hungarian Workers' Party, this progress, which has greatly contributed to the political development of the working people, has been rapidly developing.

The Hungarian people are infinitely grateful to our liberator, the Soviet Union. That is why our people voted for the People's Front to express their support for further strengthening Soviet-Hungarian friendship and strengthening the socialist and democratic peace camp fighting under the leadership of Comrade Stalin.

The results of the election have increased the leading role of the Hungarian Workers' Party in Hungary and strengthened the alliance between workers and peasants and the unity of the democratic camp. People's Hungary firmly stands on the side of the Soviet Union and is opposing the imperialist warmongers and their lackeys—the right-wing social democrats and the Tito gang of traitors and adventurers.

When talking about the trust that the people expressed in the People's Front and its leader—the Hungarian Workers' Party—during the election, we should also remember other evidence of this trust. Since the nationalization of industry a year ago, production has increased by 21.2 percent, exceeding the 1938 level by 24.4 percent. If the total value of products per worker in 1938 is counted as 100, then we see that the total value of products per worker in 1946 was 73 percent (labor productivity had declined due to the war), in mid-1948 it was 94.2 percent, and in March 1949, it was 110.5 percent.

The attitude of our working peasants towards the people's democratic state is reflected in the fact that by May 20, when the spring sowing campaign was still three weeks from completion, although the work was hindered by adverse weather, the working peasants had completed 97.9 percent of the target.

Even after liberation, the Hungarian working people must wage a hard struggle for their happiness. We have won a brilliant and complete victory in the election, but we must never be complacent. The domestic reactionaries have not been completely eliminated; the international reactionary forces abroad are still seizing the slightest opportunity to create difficulties for us. We must be highly vigilant.

The Hungarian democratic state will rely on the victory of May 15 and the trust and support of our people to move forward along the planned path. We will unite more closely in the socialist and democratic peace camp led by the Soviet Union and build socialism in our country.

　　匈人民独立阵线的胜利
    匈工人党副总书记  卡达尔
    【新华社布拉格十五日电】最近一期“争取持久和平与人民民主”刊物载有匈牙利工人党（前译为劳动人民党）中央委员会副总书记詹诺斯·卡达尔所作“匈牙利人民独立阵线底胜利”一文。摘要如下：
    五月十五日——匈牙利大选的日子，是匈牙利劳动人民欢欣地表示他们在匈牙利工人党及人民独立阵线周围团结起来的一天。
    选举结果，民主获得了完全的胜利。在六、○五三、九七二名选民中，有五、七三○、五一九名，或百分之九十四点六的选民参加了投票，比一九四七年大选多四八○、○○○人。其中有五、四七八、五一五名，或百分之九十五点六的投票者投人民独立阵线的票；一六五、二八三名，或百分之二点九投反对人民独立阵线的票；八六、七二一张选票，或百分之一点五强的选票作废。
    这些结果，对反动派来说，是完全出乎意料的。而且必须承认，这些结果甚至比匈牙利民主分子所希望的还要好。在工人阶级地区中，人民独立阵线赢得了百分之九八——九九的选票。这种政治上的高涨，在乡村也达到了高度的水平。有许多乡村在投票开始两小时之后，就有百分之百的选民投了票。成百个乡村的人民一致投票选举人民独立阵线的候选人。
    竞选运动开始时，匈牙利工人党和团结着匈牙利民主力量的人民独立阵线，就号召选民积极参加选举来表示他们赞同党为加强匈牙利民主所已进行的工作，号召人民表示他们赞同五年计划和拥护党与人民独立阵线的外交政策——目的在于与苏联共同反对帝国主义的战争计划、确保人类及匈牙利人民的持久和平的政策。在选举当中，这一纲领取得了胜利。
    匈牙利劳动人民在苏联人民的兄弟般的帮助下，业已恢复了为法西斯所摧毁了的国民经济。生活条件已获改善。三年计划正在胜利地付诸实行，并将提前七个月完成。甚至那些评论选举的资产阶级的报纸都承认——即使是勉强的——这些成就。法国外交部半官方的机关报“世界”报在评论选举时，曾写道：“选举的关键就是五年计划”，“该计划包罗经济、科学与精神生活的一切部门，并且匈牙利的每一个人都关心它的实现。”工人党所领导的匈牙利民主国家有一个建设性的纲领，而且也有执行这一纲领的力量。如果把反动派——从奈基到巴兰柯维区和贝雅——的纲领付诸实行的话，那就会意味着人民的苦难和国家的毁灭。这就是决定应投谁的票，何以对我们的选民来说，是件轻而易举的事。
    选举的结果也表明了：中农、妇女和青年之被确定地争取到民主统一阵线方面来。统一的匈牙利工人党成立后，这一个大大有助于劳动人民底政治发展的进步，业已急速地发展了。
    匈牙利人民对我们的解放者苏联感激不尽。这就是我国人民所以投票选举人民阵线，来表示他们拥护进一步加强苏匈友谊，加强在斯大林同志领导下进行斗争的社会主义与民主和平阵营。
    选举的结果业已增大了匈牙利工人党在匈牙利的领导作用，而且加强了工农的联盟和民主阵营的团结。人民的匈牙利坚决地站在苏联方面，而且正在反对帝国主义战争贩子及其走卒——右翼社会民主党人和奸细与冒险家的铁托匪帮。
    谈到选举期间人民对人民阵线及其领袖——匈牙利工人党——所表示的信任的时候，我们也应想起这种信任的其他证据。自从工业国有化一年以来，产量增加了百分之二十一点二，超过一九三八年水平百分之二十四点四。如果将一九三八年每一工人的产品总值计为一百，那么我们就看见一九四六年每一工人产品总值为百分之七十三（劳动生产率曾因战争而下降），在一九四八年年中为百分之九十四点二，而在一九四九年三月，则为百分之一一○点五。
    我国劳动农民对人民民主国家的态度，表现在这一事实上，即到五月二十日，当春播运动还有三周才满期时，虽然工作受到了恶劣气候的阻挠，劳动农民已完成了目标的百分之九十七点九。
    匈牙利劳动人民甚至在解放以后，还必须为他们的幸福进行艰苦的斗争。我们已在大选中赢得了光辉与完全的胜利，但我们绝不自满。国内反动派尚未完全消灭；国外的国际反动势力仍在攫取一个最微小的机会来给我们制造困难。我们要严加戒备。
    匈牙利民主国家将靠五月十五日的胜利及我国人民的信任和拥护，而沿着计划的道路向前迈进。我们将更紧密地团结在以苏联为首的社会主义的民主和平阵营中，在我国建设社会主义。
