Xinhua News Agency, Prague, June 14th: The Secretary-General of the Standing Committee of the World Peace Congress in Paris, the French writer Laffitte, sent three letters and a copy of the "International Peace Prize" charter to Guo Moruo, the head of the Chinese delegation to the World Congress in Defense of Peace, on June 1st. The letters notified that the address of the Standing Committee of the World Peace Congress has been selected as the Champs-Élysées in Paris. The letters also inquired about the activities of the delegations after returning to their countries and the actual struggles of the people of various countries to strive for peace. The letters stated that the Standing Committee's organ, the bi-monthly magazine "Peace Fighter," will be published in Russian, French, English, Italian, and Spanish in mid-June, and a Chinese and Arabic version are being prepared. The magazine will, with the cooperation of member states of the Congress, publish articles reflecting the struggle for peace around the world. The "International Peace Prize Charter" stipulates that, according to the resolution of the First World Peace Congress, three International Peace Prizes will be established, each with a prize of five million francs, awarded annually under the auspices of the Standing Committee of the World Peace Congress, to the most outstanding films, literary, and artistic works that most effectively consolidate human peace. Whether it is a film script or a finished film, whether it is an unpublished or published literary and artistic work, it can participate in the competition upon the proposal of the author or a third party. The work evaluation committee is composed of the Standing Committee of the World Peace Congress, chaired by the chairman of the committee, Curie. The works from various countries participating in the competition will be selected first by the peace congress organizations of each country. Works that are valuable but do not win awards will be introduced to the people of the world by the evaluation committee.
