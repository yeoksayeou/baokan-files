　　Previous Summary
    The July 7th Incident broke out, and the "National Army" fled south, causing chaos in the rural areas of central Hebei. Communist Party member Hei Lao Cai organized the peasants to resist Japan, fighting against feudal despots (He Shixiong, etc.). He finally implemented the Party's policy of unity and resistance against Japan, implemented rent reduction, transformed the regime, developed guerrilla forces, and engaged in initial battles against the enemy and puppet forces. Peasants Niu Dashui and rural woman Yang Xiaomei, etc., became cadres under the Party's education and training. At the same time, Dashui and Xiaomei's marriage was frustrated, and Xiaomei was forced to marry Zhang Jinlong, the "guard" of He Shixiong's family, leading to a struggle between the couple.

　　Chapter Three: Peasant Guerrilla Team (Continued 3)
    Shuangxi went to the dam to call people. Dashui's group had held out the longest, and Hei Lao Cai called them over first. They entered the courtyard and were surrounded by the women, who said things like, "You must be starving!" and "You must be exhausted!" When they saw the spoils of war, they all scrambled to see them. A woman named Xiu Nüer grabbed a steel helmet and put it on her head, laughing and saying, "The Japanese all wear this? It's like putting a pot on your head!" This made everyone laugh. Yang Xiaomei said, "Stop fooling around! Quickly bring the food!" Then she said to Dashui and the others, "We're short on supplies, so it's taking a while to prepare! I'm really sorry!"
    In no time, many pancakes, flatbreads, boiled eggs, and salted duck eggs filled the hands of the team members. The old women brought bowls of cooled thin porridge, saying, "Eat something dry, drink something watery, eat and drink your fill, and fight the Japanese!" The team members ate and drank while excitedly talking about how they had repelled the Japanese.
    Xiaomei had been pregnant before receiving training, and her body was already very heavy. Dashui saw her running around busily with her big belly and said to her, "We can do it ourselves. You've been busy for most of the night and traveled so far, you should rest!" Xiaomei smiled and said, "Look at what you're saying! You fought all day and night and you're not tired, what are we tired of!"
    The rooster crowed, and a cool breeze blew. Suddenly, they heard crackling sounds. The old platoon leader suddenly stood up and said, "This is the enemy's dawn attack!" Dashui put down his bowl and waved his hand, saying, "Stop eating! Let's go!" The team members all grabbed their guns and ran out. Dashui ran to the door, then turned around and said to Xiaomei, "You women should go further away." Xiaomei said, "It's alright, don't worry about us!" Dashui and the others ran off. The women gathered at the entrance of the village, watching anxiously.

    Ten

    Dashui's group ran to the edge of the dam. The sky was dimly lit, and bullets whizzed overhead. Hei Lao Cai nervously assigned them their positions, saying that the enemy was about to charge and that everyone should be resolute and brave. Just as Dashui and the others climbed onto the slope of the dam, the enemy's charge bugle sounded. They could see the scattered enemy rushing forward, their bayonets glinting. Despite the guerrillas' desperate fighting, some enemies fell, but many more advanced quickly through the water. The ones in the lead had already climbed ashore.
    The guerrillas suffered several casualties, and it looked like they couldn't hold out. Ma Dan Xiao Ai and the monk's faces were deathly pale. They pulled back their guns, slid down the slope, and tried to run. Niu Dashui also panicked and was covered in sweat. He heard Hei Lao Cai shout angrily, "Who's running? I'll shoot anyone who runs!" He also shouted, "Comrades! Throw grenades!" He held four grenades in one hand and threw them all at once. Then many grenades flew out, creating a deafening roar. The enemies who had reached the foot of the dam were hit, and their flesh and blood flew into the air.
    However, many more enemies climbed ashore. The team members gained confidence and threw grenades like hailstones, sending smoke and earth high into the air. The Japanese officers didn't care about their soldiers' lives and continued to order them to charge. Suddenly, gunfire erupted behind the enemy, from the east and the west. The guerrilla groups that Lao Cai had sent out in the woods and behind the graves had opened fire. The Japanese and puppet soldiers were terrified and turned to run, retreating in a chaotic mess. They left many things behind along the way. Hei Lao Cai, bare-backed and glistening with sweat, raised his pistol and shouted, "Chase them!" He jumped onto the dam and charged down. Everyone followed him, shouting loudly, "Chase them! Kill them!"

    Chapter Four: A Vicious Plan
    "Using Water Instead of Soldiers" – The Enemy's Conspiracy

    One

    The day after repelling the Japanese, Hei Lao Cai came to find Yang Xiaomei. Xiaomei was receiving the comfort goods sent by the villages. There were so many comfort goods! The kang was full of eggs and duck eggs; the table was piled with pastries and zongzi; towels and socks were packed in sacks, and whole pigs and sheep were carried in... Xiaomei was overjoyed. Hei Lao Cai called her to an empty room and said to her, "Your mother-in-law is very ill. Your father-in-law came to take you back, saying that if you go early, you can see her one last time, but if you go late, you won't be able to." He also told her that the village chief of He Village had written a letter saying that since He Shixiong had left, Zhang Jinlong didn't have anyone to rely on. Guo San Mazi had accidentally injured him before, but now his injury had healed, and he was much more well-behaved. Now his mother was seriously ill, and as long as Xiaomei went back, he guaranteed that he wouldn't hit or scold her. Hei Lao Cai said, "Last time Zhang Jinlong was injured, you didn't go back. Now your mother-in-law is dying, and your father-in-law is begging you to go back and see her, or it might have a bad impact. Besides, your body is heavy now, and it might be easier to go home, have the baby, and then come back to work." Xiaomei cried and didn't want to go back. Hei Lao Cai tried to persuade her for a long time before she agreed.
    Xiaomei went back home with her father-in-law. That night, her mother-in-law passed away. The family held a funeral and was busy for several days. As soon as it was over, Xiaomei started having stomach pains, and the baby was born prematurely. Her father-in-law saw that the baby was thin like a little chick, but it was a boy, and he was very happy. He was afraid that Xiaomei would go back to work, so he deliberately got some good food for Xiaomei, wanting to keep her.
    With the evil mother-in-law dead, Xiaomei suffered much less. Under the new regime, Zhang Jinlong couldn't act recklessly and became much more subdued. He saw that Xiaomei was a district cadre, and many common people and cadres came to visit her during her confinement. Women also came to her to discuss problems, so he didn't dare to bully or mistreat her anymore. Xiaomei had been dissatisfied with Zhang Jinlong before and had thought about getting a divorce. But now she had a child, and the child was her own flesh and blood. She couldn't let the child suffer. She thought, "For the sake of the child, I'll just make do!"

    Two

    At this time, the harvest season was approaching, and it was raining continuously. The water in the lakes and rivers rose. The crops were very good this year, but they were afraid of flooding. Hei Lao Cai returned from a meeting in the county and immediately called a meeting of the central village cadres. Shuangxi and Dashui both went. At the meeting, Hei Lao Cai urgently arranged for the protection of the dikes and flood prevention, saying, "This is a combat mission, and we must quickly fight the water battle!" He also said, "We will use this work to evaluate cadres and see who is genuinely protecting the interests of the common people!"
    Shuangxi and Dashui ran back and hurriedly mobilized the common people to go to the dike overnight. The water was only a foot away from the top of the dike. A drizzle was still falling. It was so dark that you couldn't see anyone's face. Everyone lit torches made of reed skins. Along the dike, like a fire dragon, they carefully checked the dike construction, blocked badger holes..., and transported soil from this side of the dike to the dike to raise it. The water rose and the soil also rose. They worked all night. The next day, the rain continued to fall, and the water continued to rise. Everyone was soaked like drowned chickens, and they all said, "Even if it's raining knives, we have to do it. We can't let it be destroyed!" They didn't even bother to eat and worked for another day and night.
    On the third day, the rain became heavier, and the water rose even faster. It was almost level with the dike. If it rained another two or three fingers' worth, it would be bad. The old men sighed and said, "It's no use, nothing can stop it!" Shuangxi ran back and forth on the dike, slipping several times, shouting, "Folks! Quickly build embankments on the dike, there's still hope, our lives depend on it! Quickly find stakes, grab whatever you can! Let's go all out!" Many people ran towards the village. Shuangxi supervised the dike. The village cadres ran back to the village separately, beating gongs on the streets, shouting, "The dike is in danger! It's about to collapse! Men, women, old and young, go to the dike! Bring wood and furniture to build the embankment!"

    Each village started to stir. The men grabbed things and ran to the dike. The old platoon leader, who was sick, also hurried down from the kang, leaning on a wooden stick, and hurried to the dike. Even women and children carried firewood, fish baskets, rafters, and beams, braving the rain to rush to the dike. Dashui removed all the doors and windows of the squadron headquarters, carried two door panels on his back, and ran like the wind. Xiaomei heard the sound of gongs and shouts at home. Her heart was in a mess. She left the child behind, turned around in the yard, and ignoring what her father-in-law was nagging, carried a bundle of reeds for weaving on her back and ran.
    On the dike, people were shouting, and the sound of hammering stakes rang out. Soil mounds were flattened, and shacks were torn down. People were carrying things, transporting soil... people coming and going, a chaotic scene. Suddenly, a water seep opened on the east side, and everyone rushed to plug it. Suddenly, another water seep opened on the west side, and everyone rushed to plug it. It was bad! The water seep on the west side couldn't be blocked. It grew bigger and bigger, bursting open a five-foot-wide hole, and water poured out with a rush. Dashui, Gao Tuncun, and a dozen young men, half their bodies immersed in water, carried door panels, furniture, and fish baskets filled with mud, desperately trying to block it, and were washed down along with the things.

　　前情提要
    七七事变爆发，“国军”南逃，冀中农村很混乱。共产党员黑老蔡组织农民抗日，一面与封建恶霸（何世雄等）进行斗争；终于贯彻了党的团结抗战政策，实行了减租，改造了政权，发展了游击队，对敌伪进行了最初的战斗。农民牛大水和农村妇女杨小梅等，都在党的教育培养下成了干部。同时大水小梅的婚姻问题遭到挫折，小梅被迫嫁给了何世雄家“护院的”张金龙，夫妻间展开了斗争。
　　第三回　农民游击队（续三）
    双喜到堤上叫人。大水这一拨顶得最久，黑老蔡叫他们先来。他们走进院里，就给妇女们围住了，这个说：“可把你们饿扁啦！”那个说：“准饿得没劲了吧？”她们一见胜利品，都争着看；一个叫秀女儿的把钢盔抢过来戴在头上，笑着说：“鬼子尽戴这个呀？这跟脑袋上扣个锅似的！”招得大家呷呷呷的乱笑。杨小梅说：“你们别闹啦！快拿东西来！”又对大水他们说：“东西不凑手，作得迟啦！可真对不住你们！”
    只一会工夫，许多卷子、烙饼、煮鸡蛋、咸鸭蛋，塞满了队员们的手里。老婆儿们又把凉好的稀粥一碗碗端来了，说：“吃点干的，喝点稀的，吃饱喝足，好打鬼子！”队员们一面吃喝，一面兴高采烈的说着打退鬼子的情形。
    小梅自从受训以前有了孕，这时候身子已经很沉了，大水看她颠着个大肚子，跑来跑去的忙着招呼，就对她说：“我们自个儿来，你们忙了多半夜，又送了这么远，也该歇歇啦！”小梅笑着说：“看你说的！你们顶着打了一天一夜还不累，我们累什么呀！”
    鸡叫了，刮起一阵凉飕飕的小风。忽然听见劈劈啪啪的响起来，老排长猛的站起来说：“这是敌人拂晓进攻！”大水放下碗，挥着手说：“别吃了！咱们快走！”队员们都拿着枪，奔了出去。大水跑到门口，又转身对小梅说：“你们妇女还是走远些吧。”小梅说：“不碍事，你们别结记！”大水他们跑去了。妇女们都聚在村口，不放心的望着。
    十
    大水这一伙跑到堤边，天朦朦的发亮了，头顶上，子弹唰唰的直飞。黑老蔡紧张的指定他们地点，说敌人快冲锋，大家要坚决勇敢，多操点儿心。大水他们刚爬到堤坡上，敌人的冲锋号就响了；看得见散开来的敌人往前直窜，刺刀都闪闪发亮。尽管游击队拚命打，有些敌人倒下了，可是很多的敌人还是飞快的趟水前进，头里的已经爬上岸来了。
    游击队伤亡了几个，眼看着顶不住，好些人慌乱了。马胆小艾和尚几个脸色死白，都抽回枪，出溜到坡底下，就想跑。牛大水也慌了手脚，急得浑身是汗。只听见黑老蔡发怒的喊：“谁跑？谁跑我崩了他！”又喊：“同志们！快摔手榴弹呀！”他一只大手，五个手指头卡着四颗手榴弹，一齐摔出去。接着许多手榴弹都飞开了，轰隆隆的山响。跑到堤跟前的敌人，刚好挨上，炸得血肉都飞了起来。
    可是，又有好些敌人爬上岸来了。队员们有了信心，手榴弹象下雹子似的扔过去，烟、土冲得老高。日本军官可不顾兵们的死活，照旧指挥他们往上冲。突然，敌人的后面，东边也响了枪，西边也响了枪，树林里，乱坟堆后面，那些——老蔡派去的游击小组，都打开了。吓得鬼子和伪军转身就跑，纷纷乱乱的撤退。一路上丢下了许多东西。黑老蔡光着脊梁，黑油油的，露出一身疙瘩肉，举起盒子枪，喊了声：“追啊！”就跳到堤上，冲了下去。大伙儿跟着他，大声喊叫，“追啊！杀啊！”都呼呼呼的追下去了。
    第四回　毒计
    “以水代兵”——敌人的阴谋
    一
    打退鬼子的第二天，黑老蔡来找杨小梅。小梅正在接受各村送来的慰劳品。慰劳品真多啊！炕上放满了鸡蛋鸭蛋；桌上堆满了点心粽子；手巾袜子都用麻袋装，整猪整羊一个个的抬来……小梅喜得眉花眼笑的。黑老蔡把她叫到一间没人的屋里，对她说：“你婆婆病得挺厉害，你公公来接你回去，说是去早了还能见一面，去迟了可就见不上了。”又告诉她：何庄的村长也来信，说何世雄走了以后，张金龙没个靠头，以前郭三麻子走火伤了他，现在他的伤好起来，可规矩多了；眼下他娘病重，只要小梅回去走一遭，他保证不打她骂她。黑老蔡说：“上次张金龙受了伤，你也没回去。这会儿你婆婆病得要死，你公公又苦苦要求，要不回去瞧瞧，怕影响不好。再说，你的身子也重了，回家去生了孩子再出来工作，或许还方便些。”小梅淌着眼泪不愿意回去。黑老蔡劝了半天，她才答应了。
    小梅跟公公回到家里。当天晚上，婆婆就咽了气。一家人办丧事，忙了几天。刚停当，不梅就闹肚子痛，孩子不足月就生养了。公公看孩子瘦得象小鸡儿似的，可是个男孩子，心里挺喜欢；只怕小梅再出去工作，有时候故意给小梅弄点儿好的吃，想拢住她。
    恶婆婆一死，小梅就少受许多气。张金龙在新政权底下，不能胡作乱为，也收心多了。他瞧小梅是个区干部，月子里，许多老百姓、干部来看望她，妇女们有什么问题还找她讨论，也就不敢再欺负她、虐待她了。小梅以前不满意张金龙，也想到过离婚；可是现在有了孩子，孩子是自己的肉啊，怎么也不能叫孩子受罪抱屈。她想：“为了孩子，能对付就对付吧！”
    二
    这时候，大秋快到了，下着连阴雨。淀里的水，河里的水，都涨了。这一年的庄稼挺好，就怕涝。黑老蔡从县上开会回来，忙召集中心村干部开会，双喜大水都去了。会上，黑老蔡紧急的布置护堤防泛，说：“这是个战斗任务，咱们要赶快打水仗！”又说：“咱们就拿这个工作鉴定干部，看谁真心保护老百姓的利益！”
    双喜大水跑回来，急忙动员老百姓连夜上堤。水离堤面只一尺了。蒙蒙的细雨还下个不停。天黑得对面不见人影儿。大家用苇皮子点起了火把，沿着堤，象一条火龙，仔细的检查堤工，堵獾洞……，又把堤这边的泥土运到堤上加高，水涨土也涨，直闹了一夜。第二天，雨还是不停的下，水还是不停的涨，大家淋得水鸡儿似的，都说：“下刀子也得干，怎么也不能叫毁了！”连饭也顾不上吃，又忙活了一天一夜。
    到第三天头上，雨下大了，水也涨得更快了；眼看快跟堤平，再下两三指雨可就坏了。老头儿们叹气说：“不中用了，再怎么也不顶事儿啦！”急得双喜在堤上来回跑，滑了好几跤，嘴里喊着：“乡亲们！赶快在堤上打埝子，还能有救，死活都在这上面了！快找桩，捞着什么拿什么！咱们豁着干吧！”很多人往村里奔。双喜督堤。村干部们分头跑回村去，满街筛锣，喊：“堤危险啦！眼看要坍啦！男女老少上堤啊！带着木料家具打埝去啊！”
    各村都闹腾开了。男人们抢了东西就往堤跑。正在病着的老排长，也忙从炕上下来，拄了根木棍，急急往堤走。连妇女孩子都抱着柴禾，提着鱼篓子，扛着椽，拖着檩，冒雨往堤赶。大水把中队部的门窗全摘了，背起两块门板就飞似的奔。小梅在家里听到锣声，听到叫喊，心里乱腾腾的，丢下孩子，在院子里转了个圈儿，也不管公公唠叨些什么，背起一捆织席的苇子就跑。
    堤上，人们乱喊着，打桩的声音咣咣响。土牛平了，窝铺拆了。搬东西的，运泥土的…人来人往，乱成一片。忽然东边开了个水眼儿，大伙忙着堵。忽然，西边又开了个水眼儿，大伙又忙着堵。不好了！西边的水眼儿堵不住，越冲越大，决开了五尺宽一个口子，水哗哗哗的直灌。大水高屯儿十几个小伙子，大半个身子浸在水里，抬着门窗家具，扛着装泥的鱼篓子，拼命去堵，连人带东西都给冲了下来。
    　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　（未完）（附图片）
