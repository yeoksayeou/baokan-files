　　People's Bank of Xuanhua Branch Issues Grape Loans
    [This newspaper reports] The People's Bank of Chahar Province Branch has issued 100,000 yuan in grape loans to the first and second districts of Xuanhua City. After receiving the notice from the branch, the Xuanhua Branch of the People's Bank took the initiative to study the issuance methods with the Social Affairs Section of the Municipal Government. It was decided that the Municipal Government would allocate the amounts according to the actual situation. After the loans were allocated to the districts, the district street cadres clarified the loan methods and targets, and then went deep into the households to investigate. Based on the needs, they provided loans to help solve the difficulties of those who could not afford to buy trellises, and paid attention to taking care of poor citizens who grew grapes. When issuing the loans, it was explained that the amount of the loan was not large and must be used for production, and should not be regarded as relief grain. If it was found that it was not used for production, it would be criticized and recovered. After the issuance, each street selected a person in charge to uniformly purchase trellises. The two districts loaned to a total of 105 households, purchasing a total of 6,083 trellises. The people who received the loans responded well.

　　人民银行宣化支行发放葡萄贷款
    【本报讯】人民银行察省分行，给宣市一、二两区发放葡萄贷款十万元，宣化支行接分行通知后，即主动与市府社会科研究发放办法，决定由市府根据实际情形分配数字。贷款分配到区后，区街干部弄清贷款办法及对象，即深入到户调查，根据需要情形，给予贷款帮助解决无力购买架杆者的困难，并注意照顾到种葡萄的贫苦市民。在发放时，讲明贷款数目不大，一定用在生产上，不得视为救济粮。发现没用到生产的，便要予以批评和收回。发放后，各街都选出负责人，统一买架杆。两区共贷给一百零五户，计买架杆六千零八十三根。获得贷款的人反映良好。
