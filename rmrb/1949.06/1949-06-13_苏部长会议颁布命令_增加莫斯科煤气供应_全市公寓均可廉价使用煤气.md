Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 12th: Moscow Dispatch: The Soviet Ministerial Council recently issued an order "Regarding Increasing Gas Supply to Moscow," deciding to accelerate the completion of several gas plants under construction, further expand Moscow's gas supply, and strive to complete the gas supply plan for all apartments in Moscow by 1952. The Moscow City Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union recently discussed this order from the Soviet Ministerial Council and passed a detailed resolution on the implementation of this order. More than two million people in Moscow are now enjoying the economical and convenient use of gas as fuel. Before the war, only 78,000 apartments in Moscow had gas equipment. In the past three years, the Soviet government has spent nearly one billion rubles to develop Moscow's gas industry. Now, the number of apartments in Moscow with gas equipment has increased to 185,000, greatly exceeding the target set by Moscow's ten-year reconstruction plan. Now, not only residents in the city center can enjoy gas, but also residents in the suburbs can enjoy gas. In some districts of Moscow, such as the Kuibyshev District and the Sverdlov District, 90% of the apartments have gas equipment, and many apartments and cafeterias use gas for cooking.

　　苏部长会议颁布命令
  　增加莫斯科煤气供应
    全市公寓均可廉价使用煤气
    【新华社北平十二日电】莫斯科讯：苏联部长会议最近颁布“关于增加莫斯科煤气供应”的命令，决定加速完成正在建筑中的若干煤气工厂，进一步扩大莫斯科的煤气供应，争取在一九五二年大体上完成莫斯科全市公寓的煤气供应计划。苏联共产党莫斯科市委会最近讨论了苏联部长会议的这一命令，并通过了关于执行这一命令的详细决议。莫斯科现在已有二百万以上的人民在享用着经济而又便利的煤气做燃料。战前，莫斯科有煤气设备的公寓，只有七万八千所。最近三年来，苏联政府为了发展莫斯科的煤气事业，已支出了将近十亿卢布。现在，莫斯科有煤气设备的公寓，已增加到十八万五千所，大大超过了莫斯科十年重建计划所规定的目标。现在，不仅市中心区的居民可以享用到煤气，而且市郊的居民也可以享用到煤气。在莫斯科某些区如古比雪夫区和斯维德洛夫区，百分之九十的公寓都已有了煤气设备，许多公寓和食堂都用煤气来煮饭做菜。
