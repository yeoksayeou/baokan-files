[Ping City News] The Beiping members of the China Society of Natural Sciences held a general meeting yesterday (the 18th) afternoon at the European and American Alumni Association. Those present included Zhao Lun, Zhang Xiaoqian, Shen Qiyi, Qi Kaizhi, Le Tianyu, Yuan Hanqing, Xue Yu, Huo Bingquan, and over twenty others. The meeting unanimously agreed that, in order to meet the needs of the people, the scientific community should unite and cooperate with a division of labor, to maximize its effectiveness. It was also believed that theoretical research and the application of science are possible and necessary to coordinate. Therefore, the popularization and improvement of science are not opposed, but rather coordinated. The meeting put forward several concrete suggestions for the upcoming National Science Conference: (1) To cooperate with the country's production plan, scientific personnel should be given appropriate work according to their expertise, so as to use their strengths. (2) Scientific publications currently edited by various societies should be funded and continue to be published. (3) Establish science museums and libraries to broadly popularize science education.

　　中华自然科学社北平社友
  　建议设科学博物馆
    【平市讯】中华自然科学社北平社友大会于昨日（十八日）下午在欧美同学会举行，计到会昭抡、张孝骞、沈其益、祁开智、乐天宇、袁翰青、薛愚、霍秉权等二十余人。会中一致认为，为配合人民的需要，科学界应团结一致，分工合作，以期发挥最大的效能。同时认为学理的研究和科学的应用，可能而且必需配合。因此科学的普及和提高不是对立的，而是协调的。该会对于行将召开的全国科学会议提出了几项具体的意见：（一）为配合国家的生产计划，科学人才应就其所学予以适当的工作，俾能用其所长。（二）现有各学会主编之科学刊物，应设法予以资助，继续出版。（三）设立科学博物馆和图书馆，广泛的普及科学教育。
