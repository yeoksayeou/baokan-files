[Chahar News] On the morning of May 31st at 7:00 AM, Guo Weishan, a supply officer of a certain regiment under the 20th Army Corps, and others were transporting grain in three iron-wheeled carts, traveling on the Huashaoying highway. Inspection policeman Jia Zengrong discovered this and immediately advised them to use side roads and footpaths, explaining the government's order prohibiting iron-wheeled vehicles from traveling on the highway. Unexpectedly, Guo Weishan not only ignored this but also spoke disrespectfully, followed by resorting to violence. He ordered five of his accompanying personnel to surround and beat Jia Zengrong, resulting in a broken left side of Jia's head, causing significant bleeding. Seeing the trouble he had caused, Guo attempted to flee, but this was discovered by the local road maintenance station, which, together with the Huashaoying district chief, took the perpetrators Guo Weishan and the other five back to the district government. To avoid delaying transportation, the district government allowed the grain carts to proceed, with Guo Weishan paying 1,060 yuan in medical expenses to temporarily settle the matter. After receiving the report, the North China People's Government stated that to develop transportation and maintain highways, the government had long issued clear orders strictly prohibiting iron-wheeled carts from traveling on highways. Guo Weishan, as a soldier, violated government orders and assaulted inspection police performing their duties. To uphold government orders and military discipline, it has specifically sent a letter to the headquarters and political department of the North China Military Region, ordering the relevant unit to thoroughly investigate, handle, and report the matter.
