　　Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 18th: TASS, Tokyo dispatch: Lieutenant General Derevyanko, the Soviet representative on the Allied Council for Japan, sent a letter to MacArthur on June 11, protesting the destruction by Japanese police, with the connivance of the American occupation authorities, of the peaceful demonstrations and marches by Japanese workers on May 29th and May 30th. The letter stated: "The Japanese government is now exerting increasing pressure on the democratic rights of the Japanese people, suppressing the legitimate activities of trade unions and other democratic organizations. These actions have recently become facts that require serious attention. Furthermore, it is noteworthy that the American occupation authorities are fully aware of the illegal actions of the Japanese government and its police in using violence to prevent the democratization of Japan. The Allied Headquarters is not taking any measures to stop these acts which violate the Potsdam Declaration and the resolutions of the Far Eastern Commission regarding the democratization of Japan. This explains why the broad masses of the Japanese people express anxiety about the fate of national democratization."
　　
　　The letter continued: The Japanese people are increasingly angry about the Japanese government's brutal suppression of the Japanese democratic movement and its use of violent means that existed during the period of Japanese militarist rule.
　　
　　Derevyanko pointed out: Measures must be taken to end the illegal anti-democratic actions of the Japanese authorities and to punish the culprits who suppressed the demonstrators and murdered Hashimoto Kinjiro.
　　
　　In a statement responding to Derevyanko's letter, MacArthur tried to evade responsibility with arbitrary words. He said: Japanese workers enjoy democratic rights. But everyone knows that it is the American authorities themselves who encourage the Yoshida government to adopt measures to suppress trade unions and democratic freedoms. Japanese workers and trade unions have in fact been deprived of all democratic rights.

　　德勒维扬哥致函麦克阿瑟
  　反对纵容日警暴行
  　抗议剥夺工会权利
    【新华社北平十八日电】塔斯社东京讯：盟国对日管制委员会苏联代表德勒维扬哥中将，于六月十一日致函麦克阿瑟，抗议日本警察在美国占领当局的纵容下，破坏五月二十九及五月三十日的日本工人和平示威游行。该函内称：“日本政府现在对日本人民的民主权利施以日益增多的压力，镇压工会及其他民主团体的合法活动。这些行为近来已经成为需要严重注意的事实。此外，值得注意的是，美国占领当局完全知道日本政府及其警察用暴力阻止日本民主化的非法行为。盟军总部不采取任何措施来制止这些违反波茨坦宣言和远东委员会关于日本民主化的决议的行为。这就说明了为什么广大的日本人民对国家民主化的命运表示焦虑。”
    该函继指出：日本人民对于日本政府残酷镇压日本民主运动，并使用日本军国主义统治时期曾经存在过的暴力手段的行动，日益愤怒。
    德勒维扬哥指出：必须采取措施结束日本当局非法的反民主行动，惩办那些镇压示威群众及杀害桥本金次郎的祸首。
    麦克阿瑟在答复德勒维扬哥的信而发表的谈话中，想拿武断的话来躲避责任。他说：日本工人享有民主权利。但是谁都知道鼓励吉田政府采取镇压工会和民主自由措施的，就是美国当局自己。日本工人和职工会实际上已被剥夺了一切民主权利。
