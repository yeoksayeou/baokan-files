　　The Relationship Between Price and Currency Value
　　Editor: In "Political Economics" (written by Xue Xiqiao), it says, "Price and value are two completely different things. Value is determined by the socially necessary labor of the commodity itself, while price is the ratio between the value of the commodity and the value of the currency (value of commodity ÷ value of currency = price)." I don't understand this formula, please explain.
  　　　　　　　　　　　Bai Zhenxing, Materials Bureau of the Ministry of Railways
    Comrade Bai Zhenxing: The value (exchange value) of a commodity is determined by the amount of socially necessary labor required to produce that commodity. In a society with developed commodity exchange, each commodity is compared with a certain amount of currency and expressed in terms of currency. This expression of the value of a commodity in terms of currency is called the price of the commodity.
    Since the price of a commodity is the value of the commodity expressed in currency, what determines the value of the currency? It is also determined by the amount of socially necessary labor required to produce this special commodity of currency. Therefore, for example, if the socially necessary labor to produce one yuan (currency) is one hour, and the socially necessary labor to produce a pen is five hours, then the price of a pen is five yuan.
    At the same time, the fluctuation of currency value is determined by the law of supply and demand in the market, that is, when the amount of currency exceeds the needs of circulation, the currency value will inevitably fall; conversely, the currency value will inevitably rise. This is especially true in countries where paper money is issued without gold and silver redemption, where the value of the currency is governed by the law of supply and demand.
    From this we can see that in the formula "value of commodity ÷ value of currency = price of commodity", if we use the above example, if the currency value remains unchanged, then it is 5 yuan ÷ 1 = 5 yuan, that is, the price of a pen is five yuan; if the currency value falls by one-half, then it is 5 yuan ÷ 0.5 = 10 yuan, that is, the price of a pen is ten yuan; if the currency value rises by one time, then it is 5 yuan ÷ 2 = 2.5 yuan, that is, the price of a pen is two and a half yuan. This means that the price of a commodity is inversely proportional to the value of the currency, that is: the higher the value of the currency, the lower the price of the commodity; the lower the value of the currency, the higher the price of the commodity.
    In addition, the price of a commodity is also affected by the market supply and demand, but the rise and fall of prices always revolves around a center—the value of the commodity.

### 价格与币值的关系

　　价格与币值的关系
    编辑同志：在“政治经济学”（薛喜樵著）上说，“价格和价值是两件截然不同的东西。价值决定于商品本身的社会必需劳动，而价格却是商品的价值，和货币的价值间的比率（商品的价值÷货币的价值＝价格）。”这个公式我不明白，请解释。
  　　　　　　　　　　　铁道部材料局白振兴
    白振兴同志：商品的价值（交换价值），是决定于生产该商品时所需的社会必需劳动量；而在商品交换发达的社会中，每件商品都是与一定量的货币来比较，都是以货币的名义来表示的。这一种以货币的名义来表示商品的价值的东西，便叫做商品的价格。
    商品的价格既是以货币表现出来的商品的价值；那么，货币的价值是为什么所决定呢？它亦是决定于生产货币这一特殊商品时所需的社会必需劳动量。因此，例如生产一元（货币）的社会必需劳动量是一小时，而生产一支笔的社会必需劳动量是五小时，那么，一支笔的价格便是五元。
    同时，币值的变动又决定于市场的供求法则，即当货币的数量超过了流通的需要时，币值必跌；反之，币值必涨。这尤其是发行纸币停止金、银兑现的国家，货币的价值便为供求法则所支配。
    由此可知，“商品的价值÷货币的价值＝商品的价格”这一公式，假使根据以上的例子，如币值不变，则为５元÷１＝５元，即一支笔的价格为五元；如币值下跌二分之一，则为５元÷０．５＝１０元，即一支笔的价格为十元；如币值上升一倍，则为５元÷２＝２．５元，即一支笔的价格为二·五元。这便是说：商品的价格是与货币的价值成反比的，即：货币的价值愈高，则商品的价格愈低；货币的价值愈低，则商品的价格愈高。
    此外，商品的价格，也影响于市场的供求，但价格的升降，却始终围绕着一个中心——商品的价值。
