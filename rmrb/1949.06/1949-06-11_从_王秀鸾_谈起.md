Starting from "Wang Xiuluan"
    Dong Zhe
    Wang Xiuluan, adorned with red flowers, was surrounded by the crowd amidst applause and the lingering sound of the song "Look at how glorious Xiuluan is..." She was lifted onto a high place to speak. With a trembling voice, she said excitedly: "...It's all thanks to the Communist Party. For generations, girls and daughters-in-law were never respected, but now they've become heroes... We must never forget the Communist Party!"
    Yes, we must never forget the Communist Party. Only under the leadership of the Communist Party and the People's Government is women's production glorious, can their political status be elevated, and can they become heroes. Let us recall how many people like Wang Xiuluan in the old society toiled day and night, treated like animals, but never escaped poverty. How many people were reduced to living hell, subjected to lifelong torment?
    With the loans and assistance provided by the Communist Party and the People's Government, and the organization of labor teams, Wang Xiuluan's family, which was a poor household in the village, borrowed grain. The enthusiastic director of the women's association also mobilized the masses to help her... Wang Xiuluan finally rebuilt the family property that her lazy mother-in-law had sold off. Later, her father-in-law returned from Zhangjiakou and asked Xiuluan to manage the household. Her mother-in-law not only stopped scolding her but also showed her special respect. Xiuluan gained economic status in the family, and thus achieved equality in life.
    Precisely because of this, Xiuluan deeply felt the help and education given to her by the Communist Party and the People's Government. Therefore, she responded to the call from higher authorities with her own actions. While plowing, she sang: "With the help of our government, difficulties cannot overwhelm Wang Xiuluan." This demonstrated her trust in the government and her determination to participate in production. After harvesting the grain in the autumn, she was not arrogant. She was once very humble and happily said: "This is all thanks to the good leadership of the Women's Salvation Association director!" Therefore, she not only engaged in production herself but also actively promoted production among others and participated in the anti-Japanese work. Therefore, Wang Xiuluan's election as a labor hero was not accidental but came about through the help of the government and her own efforts. Today, the broad masses of women in Beiping have been liberated. We already have the prerequisites for achieving complete liberation, that is: the new society has opened up a path for the broad masses of women to advance towards economic and political independence and freedom. The question is whether we proactively strive for it with determination like Wang Xiuluan. If women in Beiping today have not yet achieved complete equality and freedom in the family and in society, this is not to blame others but should be a reflection on our own weaknesses as women, just as the women's association director in the play said: "This should be a reflection on our past failure to participate in production and labor..." In the play, we can see that as long as you are determined to labor (mental or physical), to engage in various kinds of production, and actively participate in the revolutionary cause, the government will give you great help, will commend you, and the masses will support you, and your own difficulties will also be resolved. If you only want to rely on others and the government, acting as a parasite, then her ending will be like the lazy mother-in-law in the play, leading to family ruin and dispersal. Therefore, the performance of the opera "Wang Xiuluan" will give us great enlightenment and education on the question of how women can achieve complete liberation.
                                    (The End)

　　从“王秀鸾”谈起
    董哲
    王秀鸾满身红花，在群众的掌声与“你看秀鸾多光荣……”歌声的余音中，被群众拥上高处叫她讲话。她激动得声音颤抖地说：“……都是共产党来啦，成年百辈子不时兴的丫头、媳妇也当了英雄啦……咱们一辈子也不能忘了共产党呀！”
    是的，咱们一辈子也不能忘了共产党，唯有在共产党和人民政府的领导下，妇女生产才是光荣的，才能提高政治地位，才能当了英雄。我们回想一下，旧社会有多少象王秀鸾这样遭遇的人，披星戴月，把人当成牲口用，但是他始终也没有摆脱了穷困的命运，真不知道有多少人沦于人间地狱，受一辈子蹂躏。
    王秀鸾在共产党和人民政府贷粮贷款、组织拨工队帮助下，家里也是籴粮食吃的村副四保，把自己的粮食借给秀鸾，年青热情的妇会主任也发动群众帮助她……王秀鸾终于把那好吃懒作的婆婆卖得净光的家业又搞起来。后来公公从张家口回来叫秀鸾当家，婆婆不但不再骂秀鸾了，而且还特别尊敬她，秀鸾在家中经济上有了地位，生活上也就有了平等。
    正因如此，秀鸾也特别深刻的感到共产党和人民政府给她的帮助，教育，所以她用自己的行动响应了上级的号召。在她拉犁时就唱过：“有咱们政府来帮助，困难压不倒王秀鸾。”这说明了她对政府的信任，也表现了她参加生产的决心。秋天打下粮食以后，她不骄傲，曾经也很谦虚、愉快地说：“这还不是妇救会主任领导的好呵！”因此她不只自己生产，更积极的推动别人生产，并参加抗日工作，所以说王秀鸾在当选了劳动英雄不是偶然的，是在政府的帮助与个人的努力下得来的。今天，北平广大的妇女已得到解放，我们已经有了求得彻底解放的前提条件，就是说：新社会已经给广大妇女开辟了经济、政治上独立自由前进的道路，问题是在于我们是否主动的象王秀鸾一样有决心的去争取。今天北平的妇女，在家庭中，在社会上如果还没有得到完全的平等自由，这不能怪别人，应当检讨我们妇女自己的弱点，就象剧中妇会主任说的：“这应当检讨我们妇女过去不参加生产，不劳动……”而在剧中我们可以看到，只要你能坚决的去劳动（脑力、劳动或体力劳动），去从事各种生产，积极的参加革命事业，政府会给你很大帮助，会表扬你，群众也拥护你，同时你自己的困难也得到了解决。如果只想依赖别人、依赖政府，作一个寄生虫，那么她的结局，就会象剧中好吃懒作的婆婆一样，弄得家败人散。因此“王秀鸾”这一歌剧的演出，在妇女如何求得彻底解放的问题上，会给我们很大的启示与教育。  　　　　　　（完）
