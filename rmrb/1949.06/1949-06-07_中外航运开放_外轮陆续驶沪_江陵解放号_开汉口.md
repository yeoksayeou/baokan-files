Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 6th: Following the Shanghai Military Control Commission's order to open Sino-foreign shipping, foreign merchant ships have been arriving in Shanghai one after another. The Dutch Java Shipping Company's "Tzibad" arrived in Shanghai at 5:45 PM on the 4th and was granted import permission. The ship left Hong Kong at 5:00 PM on the 1st of this month, carrying five packages of imported rubber. Furthermore, the American President Lines' merchant ship "China Victory" is scheduled to arrive in Shanghai on the 7th. It will carry 741 bags of mail, as well as cotton, Western medicine, ink, and chemical instruments. In addition, the American Merchant Marine Company's merchant ships "Case Key" and "Chancey Hall" will arrive on the 7th and 10th, respectively. The company has applied to the Military Control Commission for import permission.

Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 6th: The Shanghai-Hankou route resumed on the 3rd, with the "Jiangling" ship making its first voyage to Hankou. On the afternoon of the 3rd, the Shipping Department of the Shanghai Military Control Commission's Finance and Economics Takeover Committee held a resumption ceremony on the "Jiangling" ship, with representatives of the Military Control Commission officially renaming the ship "Jiangling Liberation." The ship was once towed out of the Wusongkou by Kuomintang bandit troops on the 23rd of last month in an attempt to hijack it to Taiwan. All equipment and materials were destroyed and looted by the fleeing bandits. All 117 crew members of the ship, after liberation, disregarded hunger and thirst to carry out repairs, striving to make the ship the first to resume service after liberation.
