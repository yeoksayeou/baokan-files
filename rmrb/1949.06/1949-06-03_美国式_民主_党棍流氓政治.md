American-style "Democracy" - Political Thuggery and Rascality
By Lapisky, translated by Fu Ying

I. The More Dilapidated the City, the Richer the Mayor

Across the Hudson River from the skyscrapers of Manhattan, New York, lies a small city called Hoboken, connected to New York by ferries and tunnels. Hoboken is a port city with electrical, food, chemical, and other enterprises, with a population of 90,000. Its population is declining daily, having decreased by a third since 1930. Its houses are dilapidated, the roads are unrepaired, and children play among piles of garbage.

For twenty-five years, Hoboken has been ruled by the local Democratic Party's machine organization, headed by Mayor McFeely. The more dilapidated Hoboken became, the richer McFeely and his cronies became. McFeely established a system whereby everyone employed by the city government, from police officers and firefighters to school teachers, had to donate a certain percentage of their wages to his election campaign fund. A small portion of the election campaign funds collected in this way was indeed used for election campaigns; the rest ended up in the pockets of McFeely and his lackeys. McFeely's official weekly salary was only 71 dollars, but he accumulated a fortune of three million dollars!

Next to Hoboken City Hall (where McFeely issued orders and ruled the city) was the office and garage of McFeely's company. A major source of income for this mayor was the city's garbage removal contract. McFeely, in his capacity as mayor, signed a contract with his own company to remove the city's garbage, charging twice the normal rate. Building permits for houses in Hoboken could only be obtained if McFeely's company was hired to build them.

McFeely had come to regard the city of Hoboken as his private property, and all officials in the city government were appointed from among his relatives, near and far. McFeely's brother was appointed as the chief of the Hoboken Police Department, his son was appointed as the deputy police chief, and so on. A total of fifty of McFeely's relatives were receiving salaries from the city government.

II. Gang Leaders Manipulate Party Headquarters

Of course, Hoboken is not an exception. The political activities of the Democratic and Republican Party machine organizations are closely linked to all sorts of deception, crime, and extortion. Berle, a former Assistant Secretary of State, was deeply familiar with American politics; when he spoke of the corruption of the Democratic Party organization in New York, he said: The heads of the Democratic Party in various places are mostly hired by gangsters. He cited examples such as notorious gangsters like Costello and Adonis, who spent money to maintain many Democratic Party clubs.

The National Democratic Club on Madison Avenue in New York was one of Costello's activity centers. O'Dwyer was said to have been able to become a judge of the New York Supreme Court because of Costello's recommendation. The appointment of a judge to the Surrogate's Court of New York (which handles the property of widows and orphans) last summer was also decided by Costello. Controlling this type of institution provides a good opportunity to make money; this is why Costello paid attention to such institutions.

III. A Big-Time Gangster Politician Accumulates a Fortune of Thirty Million

The American newspapers considered the exposure of McFeely and his cohorts to be unexpected, because he should have been able to "maintain his empire in the heart of Hague's domain." Hoboken is part of the domain of another, more powerful political gangster, Hague. Hague is the head of the Democratic Party machine organization in Hudson County, and also the head of the Democratic Party machine organization in the entire state of New Jersey.

Hague is a model American political tycoon. He not only controlled the local police, but also controlled the gangsters and hoodlums. Because Hague's scope of activity was much larger than McFeely's, his bank deposits also increased more rapidly. According to newspapers, Hague accumulated a fortune of approximately thirty million dollars.

IV. No Free Election in Over Fifty Years

Memphis (one of the largest cities in Tennessee) was ruled by Crump for nearly forty years, since 1909. During these forty years, Crump ran for office eighty-five times, and won every time. The machine organization he established with the help of local manufacturers and gangsters guaranteed his victory in every election.

Whenever an election was held, if someone nominated a candidate he opposed, the newspapers would attack the candidate, printing houses would refuse to print his campaign advertisements, and no one would rent him a meeting place, and so on. On election day, the gangsters hired by Crump stood outside the polling places with pistols and clubs. Crump controlled the police, the city government, and the newspapers. In addition to being the mayor, he was also the chairman of the board of the thriving Crump Company. The Crump Company engaged in real estate speculation and a thriving insurance business.

"Tennessee has not had a free election in over fifty years," wrote Perry, the editor of the Nashville Tennessean.

This boss, Crump, not only ruled the city of Memphis, but also ruled the state of Tennessee, and the state's representatives in Congress were always Crump's lackeys. McKellar, 79 years old, served as a senator for 31 years, and was actually Crump's servant.

V. Big Capitalists and Big-Time Gangster Politicians Are Inseparable

The Pennsylvania Party machine bosses Grundy, Ullett, and Taylor held very important positions in the Republican Party. For many years, these three were the rulers of this important industrial state. Pennsylvania figure Sloeier spoke of these three, saying:

"Grundy got the gravy, Ullett got the legislation, and Taylor got the positions, bonds, and insurance. Together, they interfered in every aspect of the state government. They manipulated the Republican Party machine organization."

State Senator Taylor, chairman of the state Republican Party, was connected to the major American financial company "Fidelity and Guaranty Company," and he also had his own company - Taylor and Sons. Ullett was the president of the Pennsylvania Manufacturers Association.

Grundy, 86 years old, had resigned from his official position several years ago, but still directed the machine organization he had established forty years ago. After Dewey was nominated as the presidential candidate, Ullett was asked to serve as the national Republican chairman, as Grundy's right-hand man; but Ullett was unwilling to take the position, leaving it to Scott (who belonged to the Pennsylvania Party machine organization). Obviously, Ullett expected Dewey to be elected, and was eyeing a more profitable position. He predicted that after Dewey entered the White House, there would be a large-scale change of government personnel. National Republican Chairman Scott said on the eve of the election: "When we establish a Republican government in Washington, we will conduct a large-scale cleansing of government personnel."

This is how American big capitalists collude with big-time politicians. It is difficult to separate the industrial and financial giants from the government officials, party bosses, and gangsters who serve them.

This is the degenerate "democracy" of America.

　　美国式“民主”——党棍流氓政治
    拉皮斯基著  福英译
    一、城市越破烂，市长越发财
    在纽约曼哈坦摩天楼对面，忙碌的哈得逊河之彼岸，有一小市名霍波坚，与纽约有轮渡及地道相通。霍波坚是一个港口，有电气的、食物的、化学的，及其他的企业，人口九万。其人口日减，自一九三○年到现在，人口减少了三分之一。其房屋失修，道路也没有修补，儿童在垃圾堆间玩着。
    霍波坚在二十五年中，被当地民主党的党棍组织所统治着，其头子就是市长麦斐里。霍波坚越破烂，麦斐里及其密友越发财。麦斐里定下一个制度，市政府所雇用的一切人员，从警察、救火夫，以至学校教师，都必须将其所得工资之一定百分比，捐给做他的选举运动费。这样征收来的选举运动费，有一小部分确实用在选举运动上；其余的，则落在麦斐里及其走狗的腰包里。麦斐里每星期的官俸只有七十一元，但他却积下了三百万元的大家当！
    在霍波坚市政厅（麦斐里在此发号施令，统治该市）之旁边，就是麦斐里公司的写字间和汽车间。这位市长的收入的一个主要来源，就是这个城市的清除垃圾合同。麦斐里以市长的资格，与他自己的公司订立清除该市的垃圾的合同，收费比普通多二倍。霍波坚的房屋，只有交给麦斐里公司承造，才领取得到建屋许可证。
    麦斐里已把霍波坚市视为他的私产，市政府的一切机关人员，都由其远近亲戚担任。麦斐里的弟弟被任为霍波坚警察局长，他的儿子被任为副警察局长等等。麦斐里的亲戚，领着市政府薪水的，一共有五十人。
    二、流氓头目操纵政党党部
    当然，霍波坚并不是例外。民主党及共和党的党棍组织的政治活动，与各式各样的欺骗、犯罪、敲诈是密切连紧着的。曾任助理国务卿的柏尔，深知美国政治；他讲到纽约的民主党组织的腐败情形时，说道：各地民主党的头目，大都是流氓所雇用的。他举例说，恶名昭彰的流氓如康斯狄洛，如亚多尼斯，出钱维持许多民主党俱乐部。
    纽约马迭孙路的全国民主党俱乐部是康斯狄洛活动中心之一。欧勒里奥之所以能当纽约最高法院法官，据说是由于康斯狄洛之推荐。去年夏天纽约的苏卢给特法庭（处理寡妇孤儿之财产）的法官任命，也由康斯狄洛决定。控制这一类的机关，有捞钱的很好机会；康斯狄洛之所以注意这类机关，其故在此。
    三、大流氓政客积下家私三千万
    美国的报纸，对于麦斐里及其党徒之被暴露，认为是出乎意料之外的，因为他是应该能够“维持其在海格领域中心的帝国”的。霍波坚是另一个更强大的政治流氓海格的领域的一部分。海格是哈得逊郡的民主党党棍组织的头子，也是新泽西全省的民主党党棍组织的头子。
    海格是一个标本的美国政治大亨。他不仅控制了地方的警察，也控制了流氓地痞。因为海格的活动范围比麦斐里大得多，所以，他的银行存款也增加得更快。根据报纸所说，海格积下了约三千万元的家当。
  　四、五十多年来没有过一次自由的选举
    孟斐斯（田纳西省的最大城市之一）自一九○九年以来，被克兰普所统治将近四十年。在这四十年中，克兰普竞选八十五次，每次都胜利。他得到当地制造业主和流氓之帮助而设立的党棍组织，保证他每次竞选都得胜。
    每遇选举时，如有人提出他所反对的候选人，报纸对这候选人就加以攻击，印刷所拒绝印其竞选广告，也没有人租给集会场所等等。在选举那一天，克兰普所雇的流氓，拿着手枪、棍子，站于投票所的外面。克兰普控制警察、市政府和报纸。他除了是市长之外，他同时是生意兴隆的克兰普公司的董事长。克兰普公司是从事于地产投机和兴隆的保险生意。
    “田纳西五十多年来没有过一次自由的选举”——那士维尔田纳西人报的编辑培利写道。
    克兰普这位头目，不仅统治了孟斐斯城，但也统治了田纳西省，该省在国会中的代表，总是克兰普的走狗。七十九岁的麦凯勒，当了三十一年的参议员，实际是克兰普的仆役。
  　五、大资本家与大流氓政客分不开
    宾夕凡尼亚的党棍头目格隆狄，乌勒特，及泰罗，在共和党中，占很重要的地位。多年来，他们三人是这一重要工业省份的统治者。宾夕有名人物斯洛耶讲到这三人，说道：
    “格隆狄得肉汁，乌勒特得立法，泰罗得职位，债券，和保险。他们一起，染指省政府的一切方面。他们操纵了共和党的党棍组织。”
    省参议员泰罗，是省共和党的主席，与美国的大金融公司“忠实与保证公司”有关系，他又有自己的公司——泰罗父子公司。乌勒特是宾夕凡尼亚制造业主协会的会长。
    八十六岁的格隆狄，数年前已辞去官职，惟仍然指挥着他在四十年前所建立的党棍组织。在杜威被推为总统候选人之后，要乌勒特担任全国共和党主席，作为格隆狄的左右手；但乌勒特不愿担任此职，让给史考脱（属于宾夕凡尼亚省的党棍组织）。很明显地，乌勒特预期杜威会中选，眼睛望着更有利可夺的职位。他预料杜威踏进白宫之后，政府人员将大批更迭。全国共和党主席史考脱在选举前夜这样说道：“当我们在华盛顿成立共和党政府时，我们将大批清洗政府人员。”
    这就是美国大资本家与大政客如何勾结在一起。要把工业的和金融的巨头与为他们服务的政府官员、政党头目，和流氓区分开来，是很难的。
    堕落的美国的“民主”，就是这样。
