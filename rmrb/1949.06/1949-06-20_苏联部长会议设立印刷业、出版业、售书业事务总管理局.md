According to "Culture and Life" (this year's fourth issue), the Soviet Council of Ministers passed a resolution in early February of this year: "The General Administration for Affairs of the Printing Industry, Publishing Industry, and Book Sales Industry is established under the Soviet Council of Ministers."

In order to establish a technologically modern printing industry, improve the organization and leadership of the publishing industry, increase the output of political books, scientific books, literary books, textbooks, and other books, and develop the national book sales industry to fully meet the growing demand for books from residents in various regions, the Soviet Council of Ministers decided to establish the General Administration for Affairs of the Printing Industry, Publishing Industry, and Book Sales Industry under the Soviet Council of Ministers.

The Soviet Council of Ministers believes that the existing publishing and printing administrations attached to the Council of Ministers of each Union Republic and each Autonomous Republic, and the Executive Committee of the Soviet of Workers' Deputies of each state and each border region, must be reorganized into Administrations for Affairs of the Printing Industry, Publishing Industry, and Book Sales Industry.

The General Administration for Affairs of the Printing Industry, Publishing Industry, and Book Sales Industry under the Soviet Council of Ministers provides overall leadership (according to the General Administration Regulations) for the printing industry, publishing industry, and book sales industry throughout the Soviet Union, regardless of their affiliation, and provides leadership for printing plants, printing ink and type casting factories, publishing houses, libraries, and bookstores directly under its jurisdiction.

For this purpose, the tasks of the General Administration for Affairs of the Printing Industry, Publishing Industry, and Book Sales Industry established by the Soviet Council of Ministers are as follows:

　　Guide and adjust the activities of all publishing houses;
　　Manage the material and technical supply of the entire printing industry;
　　Preside over scientific research in the printing industry;
　　Organize the adoption of new technologies in the printing and publishing industries, formulate standards for the format of book products, and supervise the quality of all published books.

　　Formulate standards and systems for labor wages and regulations and instructions on labor issues in the printing industry, publishing industry, and book sales industry in accordance with the order prescribed by the government;
　　Lead the organization of the book sales industry and supervise the correct determination of book product prices; study issues such as copyright and royalties.

The Soviet Council of Ministers believes that the State Publishing Bureau United Office (○gis) attached to the Soviet Council of Ministers must be abolished. The houses and property occupied by the central organization of the office should be transferred to the General Administration for Affairs of the Printing Industry, Publishing Industry, and Book Sales Industry attached to the Soviet Council of Ministers.

All printing enterprises, printing ink factories and type casting factories, publishing houses, specialized schools for training and improving publishing and printing personnel, the All-Union Scientific Research Institute of the Printing Industry and Technology of Moscow, and a series of other organizations of the Publishing Bureau United Office; all libraries, bookstores, and book stalls shall be transferred to the General Administration for Affairs of the Printing Industry, Publishing Industry, and Book Sales Industry attached to the Soviet Council of Ministers.

L.P. Grachev is appointed as the Director of the General Administration for Affairs of the Printing Industry, Publishing Industry, and Book Sales Industry attached to the Soviet Council of Ministers.

The General Administration for Affairs of the Printing Industry, Publishing Industry, and Book Sales Industry is instructed to prepare a proposal for a national book sales industry organization in cooperation with the Council of Ministers of each Union Republic within a two-month period and submit it to the Soviet Council of Ministers.

The list of printing enterprises, publishing houses, and book sales offices directly under the jurisdiction of the Administration for Affairs of the Printing Industry, Publishing Industry, and Book Sales Industry, excluding the enterprises and publishing houses belonging to the Union Republics, shall be approved by the Council of Ministers of each Union Republic.
