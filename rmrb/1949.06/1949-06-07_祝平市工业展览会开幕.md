　　Opening of the Zhu Ping City Industrial Exhibition
    The Beiping City Industrial Exhibition opened yesterday. From the thousands of exhibits from over a hundred public and private factories, it can be seen that after the liberation of Beiping, with the strong support of the People's Government, the high degree of exertion of the power of all workers, coupled with the planning and improvements of various technical experts and entrepreneurs, and starting to serve the people and the farmers, the industrial production of Beiping City has been rapidly recovering and developing in the past four months.
    Although initial achievements have been made in industrial production, there are still a series of problems ahead that need to be solved. For example, in labor-management relations, both sides are generally moving towards coordination, but some uncoordinated phenomena still exist. In the future, it is necessary to resolve this issue in an organized, led, and systematic manner, based on the spirit of mutual benefit for both labor and management, so as to fully unleash the power of production. Also, with the liberation of major cities and the gradual restoration of transportation, the communication between urban and rural areas and foreign trade has achieved basic conditions; however, issues regarding the procurement of raw materials, the marketing of finished products, as well as issues regarding capital and transportation, still need to be planned and resolved jointly by the industrial and commercial sectors under the correct guidance and assistance of the People's Government.
    The significance of today's exhibition can be summed up in one sentence: "The important thing is to be good at learning." In the past, the old liberated areas held many agricultural exhibitions, which achieved great results in mutual learning and mutual encouragement, enabling agricultural production to move forward. This industrial exhibition will also, through mutual observation and mutual encouragement, strive for perfection, so that industrial production can seek common progress. At the same time, we hope that the exhibition will widely solicit opinions from all sectors, especially attaching importance to absorbing the opinions of farmers, so as to better produce more good daily necessities, various tools, and farm implements for the people, especially for the farmers, so that industrial production can be smoothly restored and developed. We hereby wish this exhibition a fruitful harvest in advance!

### 祝平市工业展览会开幕

　　祝平市工业展览会开幕
    北平市工业展览会，于昨日开幕了。从百多个公私工厂数千件展览品上，可以看出，北平解放后，在人民政府大力扶持下，依靠全体工人力量的高度发挥，加上各技术专家、企业家的筹划和改进，并开始为人民服务、为农民服务，四个月来，使北平市的工业生产正在迅速的恢复和发展着。
    虽然，工业生产有了初步的成绩，但，摆在前面的，还存在着一连串的问题需要解决。譬如：在劳资关系上，双方一般是走向了协调，但若干不协调的现象仍然存在，今后必须本劳资两利的精神，双方有组织、有领导、系统地来解决这一问题，以便充分发挥生产的力量。又如：随着各大城市的解放，交通的逐渐恢复，城乡关系、对外贸易的沟通，是取得了基本的条件；但是关于原料的采购，成品的推销，以及关于资金、运输等方面的问题仍须在人民政府正确的指导和扶助下，由工商业界共同来策划解决。
    今天这个展览会的意义，可以借一句话来说：“重要的问题在善于学习”。过去老解放区曾经举行过许多次农业展览会，收到了互相学习，互相鼓励的很大成效，使农业生产得以向前推进。这次工业展览会亦将在互相观摹，互相鼓励下，精益求精，使工业生产得以共求进步。同时，我们希望展览会广泛征求各界意见，尤其是重视吸取农民的意见，更能很好地为人民、尤其是为农民生产更多好的日用必需品与各种工具与农具，使工业生产顺利地恢复与发展。我们特预祝这一展览会能以获得丰满的收获！
