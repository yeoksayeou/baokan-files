Short Comments

	Fully Develop Production Efficiency
	The farmers near Liaoyang, Northeast China, transferring their surplus labor to factories is an inevitable result of the normal development of industry and mining and the universal organization of agricultural labor. Industrial and agricultural production in the Northeast has shifted from recovery to normalcy, and farmers entering factories is a rational new phenomenon. In North China, our industrial production is still in the process of recovery. The central issue before us is: how to rationally improve labor organization, increase efficiency, and save manpower and materials. All factories should scientifically, meticulously, and rationally organize machines and manpower in production based on equipment conditions, efficiency, and technical level, so as to avoid waste of machines and manpower, thereby increasing output, improving quality, reducing costs, and accumulating capital. To this end, we must correct some current unreasonable phenomena, such as the number of indirect production personnel exceeding the number of direct production personnel, and the waste of labor force among direct production personnel due to unreasonable labor organization, and machines not being assigned to specific personnel, which affects the shortening of the lifespan of machines. All regions should respond to Comrade Yi Bo's call to launch democratic and economy movements, implement democratic management, convene employee representative conferences and factory management committees, listen to mass opinions, adjust manpower, adjust personnel, machines, and materials, increase direct production personnel, and improve the labor efficiency of employees. Universally implement the responsibility system to enhance the sense of responsibility and technical proficiency. Absorb workers' opinions extensively to improve the coordination of manpower and machines, so that the efficiency of each production unit can be fully developed and the production process becomes more rational. This is an urgent task in our industrial production today.

　　三言两语
　　高度发挥生产效能
    东北辽阳附近农民将节余劳动力转入工厂，这是工矿业正常发展以及农业劳动力普遍组织起来后一个必然的结果，东北工农业生产已由恢复走上正常，农民投入工厂是一个合理的新的现象。在华北，我们的工业生产尚在恢复的过程中，摆在我们面前的中心问题是：如何合理地改进劳动组织提高效率节省人力物力的问题，一切工厂都应根据器材条件、效能、技术程度，将机器和人力科学的、严密的、合理的组织在生产之中，不使机器人力发生浪费现象，从而增加产量，提高质量，降低成本，积累资本，为此就必须纠正目前某些不合理现象，举如间接生产人多于直接生产人员、直接生产人员又因劳动组织不合理发生劳力浪费，机器无专人负责，影响机器寿命缩短等现象。各地都应响应一波同志开展民主运动节约运动的号召，实行民主化管理，召开职工代表会、工厂管理委员会，倾听群众意见，调整人力，调整人员机物，增加直接生产人员，提高职工劳动效率。普遍实行专责制，提高工作责任心与技术熟练程度。大量吸收工人意见来改进人力与机器的配合，使每一生产单位的效能都能得到高度发挥，使生产过程更加合理。这在今天，是我们工业生产上紧迫任务。
