　　Soviet Union Persists in Peaceful Policy, Resulting in Important Agreements at Foreign Ministers Conference
    Serious Economic Crisis in US and UK, Intensifying Contradictions Between the Two Countries

The sixth postwar Foreign Ministers Conference of the Soviet Union, the United States, Britain, and France, lasting four weeks, concluded on June 20th. This conference reached agreements on important issues related to the Austrian treaty. For example, the resolution of issues such as Austrian reparations and borders has laid the foundation for drafting the Austrian peace treaty. On the German issue, the conference also reached some agreements. The conference determined that representatives of the four countries would exchange views in September regarding holding another Foreign Ministers Conference to discuss the German issue; and stipulated that the occupying authorities in Germany should hold joint consultations in Berlin in order to "reduce the impact of the current administrative division of Germany and Berlin," "in accordance with the willingness of the Foreign Ministers to continue their efforts to achieve the restoration of Germany's economic and political unity." The reason why the Foreign Ministers Conference was able to reach agreements on some issues is due to the persistence of the peaceful democratic camp, led by the Soviet Union, in its peaceful policy and its resolute struggle, and it is the result of the policy of provoking war by the imperialist camp, led by the United States, suffering setbacks and facing numerous difficulties. However, on the most important German issue—the issue of German economic and political unity and the preparation of a German peace treaty—no agreement was reached due to the obstruction of the United States, Britain, and France.

　　苏联坚持和平政策结果
  　促成外长会议重要协议
    美英经济危机严重两国矛盾日深　
    苏美英法战后第六届外长会议，历时四周，已于六月二十日闭幕。本届会议已在奥国和约的重要问题上取得了协议，例如奥国赔偿和边界等问题的解决，已为起草对奥和约建立了基础。在德国问题上，会议也获致若干协议。会议确定四国代表将于九月对于举行另一次外长会议讨论德国问题一事交换意见；并规定德境各占领当局应于柏林举行共同会商，以便“按照各外长准备继续努力以求达到恢复德国的经济与政治的统一的意愿”，“减少目前德国与柏林在行政上分割的影响”。外长会议之所以能在若干问题上得到协议，这是由于以苏联为首的和平民主阵营坚持和平政策并进行坚决斗争的结果，是以美国为首的帝国主义阵营挑拨战争的政策遭受打击并面临重重困难的结果。但是，本届会议在最重要的德国问题——德国经济政治统一问题及准备对德和约问题上，由于美英法的阻挠，并未取得协议。
