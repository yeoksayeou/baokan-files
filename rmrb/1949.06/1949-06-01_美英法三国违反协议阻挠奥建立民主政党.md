Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, May 31st: TASS, Vienna—During the Allied Council for Austria's examination of Austrian Interior Minister Helmer's statement on establishing new political parties in Austria, the Soviet High Commissioner for Austria revealed that the representatives of the United States, Britain, and France misinterpreted the October 1, 1945 resolution regarding the organization of new political parties. When many new parties submitted their platforms to the Allied Council and requested permission to operate, they were invariably rejected by the Western authorities. The Soviet representative cited the "Democratic League" and the "Democratic Party" as examples to illustrate the Western authorities' sabotage of the four-power unanimous agreement. The Soviet representative also suggested that "the Allied Council authorize the political director to review the statements submitted by the new parties within one month and submit opinions to the Allied Council, allowing all new parties (if their platforms do not contradict the Allied Council's resolution of September 11, 1945) to conduct political activities in Austria." The US and French representatives opposed this proposal, exposing their unwillingness to promote the democratic development of Austria. The Allied Council examined the issue of Nazi propaganda conducted by newspapers such as "New Front," "Abendruf," and "Way Out," and decided to warn the editors of these newspapers. The Soviet representative then spoke on the Austrian government's request to relax Allied control over Austrian transportation. He pointed out that the US and British representatives deliberately evaded resolving this issue and repeatedly disagreed with the Soviet representative's specific suggestions to expand the powers of the Austrian Transportation Administration, indicating that the US and Britain were unwilling to expand the powers of the Austrian government.

　　美英法三国违反协议阻挠奥建立民主政党
    【新华社北平三十一日电】塔斯社维也纳讯：奥境盟国委员会审查奥内长赫尔沫在奥国建立新政党的声明时，奥境苏高级专员揭露美英法三国代表曲解一九四五年十月一日关于组织新政党的决议，对于许多新的政党将其纲领提交盟国委员会，并请求允许他们活动时，总是被西方当局所否决。苏代表并举出“民主同盟”、“民主党”为例，说明西方当局破坏四国一致协议的决议。苏代表并建议“盟国委员会授权政治主任，在一个月内审查新政党提出的声明，并向盟国委员会提出意见，允许一切新政党（如果他们的纲领与盟国委员会一九四五年九月十一日决议不矛盾），在奥国进行政治活动。”美法代表反对这一建议，这暴露了他们不愿促进奥国民主发展。盟国委员会审查了关于“新阵线”、“阿本鲁夫”和“出路”等报刊所进行的希特勒宣传的问题，决定警告这些报刊的主编。苏代表旋就奥政府所提放松盟国对奥国交通管制的要求发言。指出美英代表故意规避解决这一问题，并一再不同意苏代表关于扩大奥国交通管理局权力的具体建议。表明美英不愿扩大奥政府的职权。
