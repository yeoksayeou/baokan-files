“All rise, salute the people's leaders!”
    A sketch of the New Political Consultative Conference Preparatory Meeting twenty minutes before adjournment.
    By our reporter Bai Sheng

    At 6:20 PM on the 19th, when Chairman Zhou Enlai announced that the meeting was about to adjourn, Mr. Deng Chumin, a representative of democratic professors, stood up from the representative seats and said抢着: I have a temporary motion here: The convening of the preparatory meeting of the New Political Consultative Conference is an epoch-making event. The convening of this meeting should first and foremost be attributed to Chairman Mao, the leader of the Chinese Communist Party, and Commander-in-Chief Zhu De of the Chinese People's Liberation Army. Therefore, we propose that a telegram of respect be sent to Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu, and ask the chairman to include this in the agenda for a vote. Following his words, a burst of enthusiastic applause erupted, expressing unanimous support for the motion.

    Comrade Zhou Enlai asked with a smile: Could this be left for discussion at the formal meeting in the future?

    Mr. Deng Chumin stood up again and insisted on his proposal: The preparatory meeting is also a meeting, and I would like to ask the chairman to submit it to a vote! (A burst of laughter filled the venue)

    At this moment, Chairman Mao suddenly stood up from his seat. He said calmly: Representatives! I propose: During the preparatory meeting, we are coinciding with the July 7th Anniversary. Please let all parties jointly issue a commemorative document to celebrate the victory of the War of Resistance Against Japan! The victory of the Liberation War! At this moment, all the representatives immediately welcomed Chairman Mao's proposal with thunderous applause.

    Comrade Zhou Enlai continued, this also includes Mr. Deng Chumin's opinion. Since everyone has expressed their agreement, should we hand it over to the Standing Committee to decide to send a telegram in the name of the Preparatory Committee?

    Professors Deng Chumin and Xu Deheng then stood up and spoke one after another: The meeting has been going on for five days, but we have not yet expressed anything about the domestic and international situation. Our proposal to pay tribute to Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu not only demonstrates the sincere unity of everyone at the meeting, but also demonstrates our great unity internationally. Mr. Shen Junru, who is over seventy years old, also stood up excitedly and said: All representatives know that thanks to the leadership of Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu of the Chinese Communist Party, we are able to hold a meeting here. Therefore, I propose that before the meeting adjourns, all representatives stand up and pay tribute to Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu. All the representatives believed that this proposal could be implemented immediately and immediately expressed their approval with enthusiastic applause. Yang Gengtian, the farmer representative, stood up excitedly and added: "Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu are both here today. Without the leadership of Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu, we would not have today. We should pay tribute to the leaders!"

    At this moment, Mr. Shen Junru took the lead in standing up from his seat and shouted: "All rise, pay tribute to Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu!"

    The representatives stood up neatly, and then there was even more enthusiastic applause, which became louder and tighter, lasting for as long as three minutes. Chairman Mao, sitting in the 101st representative seat, and Commander-in-Chief Zhu, sitting in the 102nd representative seat, hurriedly turned around humbly and repeatedly returned the salute and thanked all the representatives.

    “全体起立，向人民的领袖致敬！” 
     新政协筹备会休会前二十分钟的速写
    本报记者  柏生
    这是十九日下午六时二十分钟在主席周恩来同志宣布大会要休会的时候，从代表席站起了民主教授代表邓初民先生，抢着说：我这里有个临时动议：新政协筹备会的召开，是一件划时代的大事情，所以能召开这个大会，首先应归功于中国共产党领袖毛主席和中国人民解放军朱德总司令，因此我们提议，应向毛主席和朱总司令通电致敬，请主席把这列入议程中去表决。随着他的话音，响起一片热烈的掌声，表示一致拥护这个动议。
    周恩来同志含笑回问道：这是否可留在将来正式会议时再谈？
    邓初民先生又站起来坚持自己的提议：筹备会也是会议，还请主席提交表决！（会场上洋溢着一阵笑声）
    这时毛主席忽然从自己坐位上站起来了，他稳重的说：代表们！我提议：我们在筹备会期中，正逢着七七纪念，请各党派共同发表纪念文件，庆祝抗日战争胜利！解放战争胜利！这时全体代表立即以雷动的掌声来欢迎毛主席的这个提议。
    周恩来同志接着说，这样连邓初民先生的意见也都包括在内了，大家既然都表示同意，我们是否就交常委会决定以筹委会名义发出电文？
    邓初民、许德珩教授又先后站起来发言：大会已经进行了五天，但我们对国内国外还没有什么表示，我们的提议向毛主席和朱总司令致敬，不仅在会场上是表现了我们大家的精诚团结，同时在国际上也表现了我们的大团结。七十余岁的沈钧儒先生也兴奋的站起来说：各位代表都知道，由于中国共产党领袖毛主席和朱总司令的领导，我们才能在这里开会，所以我提议在散会前，我们全体代表起立向毛主席、朱总司令致敬。全体代表认为这个提议立即可以作到的，立即以热烈的掌声表示赞成。农民代表杨耕田站起来激动地补充道：“今天毛主席、朱总司令都在这里。如果没有毛主席、朱总司令的领导，我们不能有今天，我们应该向领袖致敬！”
    这时沈钧儒老先生就领头从坐位上站起来了，喊着：“全体起立，向毛主席、朱总司令致敬！”
    代表们整齐的站起来了，随即响起了更热烈的掌声，并且愈来愈响愈紧，竟达三分钟之久。坐在一○一代表席上的毛主席和一○二代表席上的朱总司令忙即谦虚地转回身来向全体代表连连答礼致谢。
