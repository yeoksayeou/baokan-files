　　To Prevent Cholera, Get Vaccinated!
      Peng Ruizong
    Vaccination is a good way to prevent cholera. Examples from China can also prove this. For example, during the cholera epidemic along the Yangtze River in 1938-9, all the patients had not been vaccinated. Those who had only one shot, resulting in incomplete immunity, experienced milder symptoms when they contracted the disease.
    Promoting vaccination among citizens is a common practice as summer approaches. But is vaccination really effective? We can look at the experience in India: India is a world-renowned area where cholera is prevalent. During the major epidemic from November 1942 to January of the following year, there were a total of 300,000 cholera patients, and more than 169,000 people died. In that area, a total of more than 12 million people were vaccinated. We can easily see the effectiveness of vaccination from the following information:
    (1) Comparison of morbidity: If one person among the vaccinated contracts the disease, 11.4 people among the unvaccinated will contract the disease, for the same number of people. Vaccination can indeed reduce the chance of contracting the disease. Even if one contracts the disease after vaccination, it is much milder.
    (2) In some villages, more residents were vaccinated after the first epidemic, and there was no second epidemic. In addition, in many villages, fewer people were vaccinated, and a second epidemic occurred. According to their experience, if 50 percent of the entire population is vaccinated, it will greatly help to curb a large-scale cholera epidemic.
    (3) How many days after vaccination can the preventive effect occur? General experience is that it reaches its peak after the eighth day and can last for a year.
    From the above results, we can see the benefits of vaccination and its effects. Now that summer is here, we should pay special attention to preventing the spread of cholera, and vaccination can be said to be one of the better preventive measures.

　　预防霍乱，要打预防针！
      彭瑞骢
    打预防针是预防霍乱的好办法，用中国的例子也可以证明，例如一九三八—九两年，长江沿岸的霍乱病流行时，凡是病人都没有打过针，而间有只打一针，成为不完全免疫的，得了病，也轻得多。
    夏天快来的时候打预防针，在市民中是普遍的推行。但是预防针究竟有效吗？我们可以看一看在印度的经验：印度是世界知名的霍乱流行地，在一九四二年十一月到次年一月的大疫期中，共有三十万个霍乱病人，死掉了十六万九千多人。在那个地区，一共有一千二百多万人打了防疫针，我们从下面的材料里，很容易看出打防疫针的功效来：
    （一）发病情形的比较：同样多的人，打防疫针的人之中有一人发病的话；没打过防疫针的人之中就会有十一·四个人发病。打过防疫针后，的确可以减少罹病的机会。打过针后，既发病，也轻的多。
    （二）在有些村庄的居民，在第一次流行之后打过防疫针的人数比较多，就没有成为第二次流行。另外有很多的村庄，打过防疫针的人比较少，就还发生第二次流行。根据他们的经验，假如全人口中百分之五十都打过防疫针的话，对霍乱病大流行的遏止有很大作用的。
    （三）打过防疫针后，多少天就能发生防疫作用呢？一般的经验是在第八天后就达到了最高峰，而能持续到一年。
    从上面的结果，可以看出打防疫针的好处，以及他的作用。现在夏天了，我们应该特别注意预防霍乱病的流行，打防疫针也可以说是预防办法中比较好的一个。
