　　Facilitating Urban and Rural Transport
  　Smooth Roads in the Bohai Region
    [Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, 18th] The highway construction in the Bohai region of Shandong is developing rapidly. The Shandong Bohai Highway Administration Bureau recently opened two new lines: Huimin to Cangzhou and Huimin to Zhangdian. The bureau has already opened highways including the Huimin to Jinan line, Huimin to Dezhou line, Huimin to Lijin line, Huimin to Tianjin line, Dezhou to Cangzhou line, and Dezhou to Jinan line. Now, the Bohai region's highway network, centered on Huimin, connects to the Jiaoji Railway and the Zibo branch line in the south, and to the Jinpu Railway in the northwest. This allows coal and pottery from Boshan to be directly transported to the interior of the Bohai region. It also allows industrial raw materials such as cotton and grain produced in the Bohai region to be transported to major and medium-sized cities via the Jinpu and Jiaoji railways, in exchange for necessities for the peasants. Currently, the exchange of materials between urban and rural areas in the Bohai region is becoming increasingly smooth.
