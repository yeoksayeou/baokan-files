　　To implement the spirit and resolutions of the Northern Factory Affairs Conference, the Changxindian Railway Factory is proceeding with a planned and methodical approach. The day after the Northern Factory Affairs Conference concluded, the factory's military representative, factory director, engineer, and worker representatives held a special discussion based on the factory's situation and the three central tasks indicated by the Factory Affairs Conference: establishing the factory responsibility system, establishing the factory management committee, and formulating the production plan for the second half of the year. They decided that before June 15th, they would convey and discuss the spirit of the Factory Affairs Conference through large and small meetings, so that all employees would understand the benefits and practices of the responsibility system, the role of the factory management committee, and the importance of the production plan. After the 15th, the factory management committee would be formally established. The factory management committee would rely on the worker masses to formulate the production plan for the second half of the year. After the steps were determined, on June 2nd, they began to follow the above plan, with the factory director and worker representatives conveying the resolutions from 10:00 to 12:00 in the morning and 5:00 to 6:00 in the afternoon, respectively. It is expected that they will be able to enter formal deliberation and discussion on the 7th. At the same time, under the leadership of the section trade union, the factory's trade union examined the shortcomings in the trade union work in the previous period. Based on the spirit of the North China Workers' Representative Conference, it clarified that future worker education should focus on participating in democratic factory management, improving production, and abiding by labor discipline. Currently, the administration and trade union are actively cooperating in this regard. (Military)

　　[本报讯] Changxindian Railway Factory's passenger and freight car yard suddenly caught fire on the evening of the 3rd. Fortunately, it was extinguished in time, avoiding major damage, but destroying a workbench in the carpentry group and a small number of small tools. The cause of the fire is still under investigation. However, several issues can be seen from this fire: (1) Although the yard door was locked, four or five windows were still not closed; (2) The night watchman was a mere formality, not noticing the fire when it started; (3) The worker patrol team did not play a role in this fire because of insufficient prior education. After this incident, the work committee, trade union, and administrative负责人 immediately held a meeting to review the situation and conducted anti-espionage education for the worker patrol team based on this fact.

　　贯彻北方厂务会议决议
  　长辛店铁路机厂订出计划
    【本报讯】长辛店铁路工厂正在有计划、有步骤地贯彻北方厂务会议的精神与决议。在北方厂务会议结束后的第二天，该厂军事代表、厂长、工程司和职工代表即根据本厂情况，及厂务会议指示的建立工厂负责制、建立工厂管理委员会，制定下半年生产计划三大中心任务，作了专门的讨论，确定六月十五日以前通过大会小会传达与讨论厂务会议的精神，使全体职工懂得负责制的好处和作法，厂管会的作用和生产计划的重要性；十五日后正式组成厂管会。由厂管会依靠工人群众，制定下半年生产计划。步骤确定后，于六月二日开始，即按照上述计划，每逢上午十时至十二时，下午五时至六时，分别由厂长、职工代表传达决议，预定七日即可进入正式酝酿讨论。与此同时，该厂职工会在段工会的领导下，检查了前一时期工会工作中的缺点，根据华北职工代表会议的精神，明确了今后职工教育应以参加工厂民主管理、提高生产、遵守劳动纪律为主。现正在行政、工会互相配合下积极进行中。（军）
    【本报讯】长辛店铁路工厂客货车场，三日晚突然起火。幸扑灭及时，未遭大害，烧毁木工组工作桌一张，及少部小型工具。起火原因尚在调查中。但从这次火警中也可看出几个问题：（一）场门虽已下锁，但仍有四五个窗子没有关上：（二）更夫形同虚设，起火时还没发觉。（三）工人纠查队因预先教育不够，在此次火警中未起作用。此事发生后，工委、职工会及行政负责人立即开会检讨，并就此事实，对工人纠查队进行了防特工作教育。
