Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 11th. London dispatch: Over ten thousand dockworkers in the major British seaports of Liverpool, Bristol, and Avonmouth have been on strike for three weeks in support of Canadian seamen. The strikers, in sympathy with the Canadian maritime workers who have been on strike for nearly two and a half months, refuse to load and unload Canadian ships. As a result of this strike, there are currently thirty ships in Liverpool harbor alone that cannot be unloaded. After the Labour government's scheme to persuade strikers to "voluntarily" unload perishable goods failed, British Prime Minister Attlee issued a threatening statement on the 8th, saying that if the strike does not stop immediately, the government will take "necessary measures to deal with the strikers." Based on past experience, this means that the Labour government will use troops to unload goods to undermine the strike.

　　英万余码头工人
  　坚持罢工已三周
  　支援加拿大海员
    【新华社北平十一日电】伦敦讯：英国利物浦、布利斯托、阿冯茅斯三大海港的码头工人万余名，为支援加拿大海员而举行的罢工，已坚持三星期之久。罢工者为了表示对罢工已近两个半月的加拿大海员工人的同情，拒绝起卸加拿大船只的货物。由于这一罢工，仅利物浦港内目前即有三十只轮船，无法卸货。工党政府在劝说罢工者“自愿”卸下易于腐烂的货物的计谋失败后，英首相艾德礼竟于八日发表恫吓声明说：如果罢工不立即停止，政府将采取“必要的措施对付罢工者”。根据过去的经验，这就是说工党政府将使用军队卸货来破坏罢工。
