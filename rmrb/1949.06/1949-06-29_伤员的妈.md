　　The Wounded Soldiers' Mom
　　Sǒng Chù
　　Granny Zhang Jingchun of Xujiayu, Fifth District of Pinggu, is affectionately called "Mom" by more than 600 wounded soldiers of the × Department Hospital. Granny Zhang is 55 years old this year and lives with her husband, two sons, and two daughters. In the past, her family's life was very difficult, without a single room or a piece of land, living in tears with constant food and clothing shortages. Her husband went to work in the coal mines in Tangshan as an adult, selling his labor, and her eldest son started working for landlords as a child. Her youngest son, Quntou, was sent to a temple in Xinglongzhuang as a monk when he was only three years old, and her two daughters were given away as child brides because she couldn't afford to raise them. She worked as a nanny for the Yongyuetang rich man in Yukou. The poor life forced her family to be scattered. By the 32nd year of the Republic of China (1943), the heartless landlord disliked her for being old and didn't want her anymore. Her daughters who were child brides and her son who was a monk were also returned. She had to lead her children to beg for food in the wind and snow. She lived through these sorrowful days like this. In the 35th year of the Republic of China (1946), the Communist Party implemented land reform, and the poor people were given houses and land. Only then did Granny Zhang's family turn over a new leaf. She often said to her family, "The Communist Party helped us to turn over and saved our whole family!" After turning over, she sent her eldest son to join the army, and she was elected as the director of the women's association in the village. She was active and responsible in her work, especially in supporting the army, setting a good example for the whole village. Last November 12th, the × Department Field Hospital came to the village, and Granny Zhang cared for the wounded soldiers as if they were her own children. When the wounded soldiers first arrived, she served them for ten days and nights without rest. Every day, she personally went to each ward two or three times, and she didn't go back to sleep until late at night. Her feet were so tired that she had several big blisters. But she never complained of being tired or bothered. Day and night, she collected urine, collected stool, wiped pus, wiped blood, picked lice, and washed wounds for the wounded soldiers. She personally fed the wounded soldiers when they ate and drank, always tasting the temperature first before bringing it to their mouths. One night, close to dawn, the weather was very cold, and it was a dark night when you couldn't see your hand in front of your face. She had just laid down to sleep when she heard a seriously wounded soldier in Chen Zhiyou's house ask for water. She quickly got up, boiled two kettles of water, and personally fed him, sip by sip. The wounded soldier was so moved that he shed tears and said, "You are even closer to me than my own mother." She was afraid that the wounded soldiers would be in pain and miss their homes, so she always comforted them gently whenever she went to any ward. The wounded soldiers were always happy to see her and reluctant to let her go. Granny Zhang was always afraid that the wounded soldiers' mouths would be wronged (not being able to eat what they wanted), so sometimes she would send fresh food from her home to the wounded soldiers or invite them to eat at her home. On the sixteenth day of the twelfth lunar month, her family slaughtered a small fat pig to prepare for the New Year. She sent the cooked pig trotters and fatty intestines to the new wounded soldiers. She was very sad when the wounded soldiers didn't eat them. She treated the wounded soldiers as her own sons, saying, "You have worked so hard and shed blood for us in the war. I would rather my family not eat than let you be wronged!"

　　Her home was like the home of the wounded soldiers. She and her two daughters sewed and washed for the wounded soldiers every day, tearing up their own old clothes and making seven-layered paper soles to make shoes and hats for the wounded soldiers. Just in the middle of the twelfth lunar month last year, the three of them, mother and daughters, took apart and washed more than forty pieces of bloody clothing, mended more than thirty pairs of socks, made more than one hundred collar covers, more than twenty pairs of sock covers, and also made a pair of cotton trousers and mended three pairs of socks for the wounded soldiers. Her husband also served water and food, asked about cold and heat, and often went to the market to buy things for the wounded soldiers, just like her. Granny Zhang said to the villagers, "If it weren't for the Communist Party to save me, if it weren't for them (the wounded soldiers) fighting the war, I would still be begging for food, and my family would never be reunited!"

　　Because of her care and love for the wounded soldiers, the six hundred wounded soldiers in the two units were all moved and called her "Mom." Last year, on the twenty-fourth day of the twelfth lunar month, she became ill from exhaustion. All the working convalescents in the unit were moved and sent representatives to visit and give gifts. The Third Company sent her pastries, the Second Company sent her noodles, and the First Company sent her persimmons and big sour pears. The doctors in the unit said she was sick and rushed to treat her even before eating. On the first day of the Lunar New Year, all the comrades in the unit paid New Year's greetings to Granny Zhang.

　　After the New Year, some wounded soldiers, for entertainment, quarreled over playing cards. When she found out, she criticized them with a kind and gentle expression. The wounded soldiers respectfully accepted her criticism. One of the wounded soldiers said with emotion, "Mom! I'm sorry for you. I will never do such a thing again!" This year, in the first lunar month, a group of recovered wounded soldiers were discharged from the hospital to return to the front line. When they were about to leave, they said goodbye to her, "You care for us so much, we will never forget it. This time we will return to the front line and will definitely kill the enemy and perform meritorious service to repay you!"

　　Granny Zhang is not only a model for caring for the wounded soldiers, but also a labor model. The work in her home is never done by other villagers as help. The thirteen mu of land she was allocated are all cultivated by her and her daughters (because her husband was ruined by working in the coal mine and cannot do heavy work). In her spare time, she and her two daughters spin thread. The three spinning wheels spin more than one jin per day, and last year alone they spun a hundred jin of thread. Last summer, she also sewed and sold more than forty pairs of large shoe soles. Her name has spread throughout Pinggu County, and no one does not admire her when they mention her. In February, at the county women's representative conference, it was proposed to elect a county women's representative to attend the Jidong Women's Representative Conference, and to elect someone who is good and truly serves the people. After two days of deliberation, everyone looked at Granny Zhang Jingchun and said, "She really has merit. Just look at how she cares for the wounded soldiers, day and night, taking care of their urine and stool, saving so many seriously wounded soldiers!" The representatives all said, "Electing her is better than anyone else." Some said, "Anyway, I won't elect anyone else, just Granny Zhang Jingchun!" After the deliberation was complete, she was honorably elected as a county women's representative and a member of the county women's federation executive committee to attend the Jidong Women's Representative Election Conference.

　　After Granny Zhang was elected, she thought that she was so old and had become a representative. The male and female comrades in the county and district were all very kind to her, and she was truly happy. She decided that after returning to the village, she would have to work harder, take good care of the wounded soldiers, and also put some effort into agricultural production.

　　Soon, after attending the Jidong Women's Representative Election Conference, she then attended the National Women's Representative Conference. The wounded soldiers living in her home were anxiously waiting for her, as if they had lost their dear mother. The wounded soldier Zhang Liansheng said to his fellow wounded soldiers, "Mom has gone to the meeting and will be back in half a month." Another wounded soldier said, "Take good care of your wounds! When your wounds are healed, go and work for Mom. She will definitely be happy when she comes back." After saying this, the wounded soldiers who had recovered all went to work for her. Although the old woman was not at home, they thought of everything carefully, collecting manure, delivering manure, making adobe bricks, building kang, and preparing well for spring plowing.

　　The health center lived in this village for three or four months. The troops were going to go south, and the health center was also going to transfer with them. Some of the wounded soldiers stayed in the sub-district health center, and some followed the hospital. Zhang Liansheng and Pei Yun asked the superiors to wait for Granny to come back before leaving because they were seriously ill. The superiors agreed. When the other wounded soldiers were about to leave, they were all a little reluctant, and some left Xujiayu with tears in their eyes. Although Granny Zhang was not at home after the wounded soldiers left, letters kept coming, and her youngest daughter kept them for her. After a few days, the wounded soldiers Lao Tang, Wang Hong, Wei Hai, Liu Gui, and others, upon discharge from the hospital, happily came to see Granny Zhang Jingchun, who had taken care of them day and night and saved their lives. As soon as they entered the village, they heard that Granny was attending the National Women's Representative Conference, and they all left a gift and left. The soldiers who went to the front line kept sending her letters and also reported the victory news. In less than two months, she received more than sixty letters.

　　The National Women's Representative Conference ended, and the old woman returned. From the sub-district and county to the district and village, everyone lined the streets to welcome her. The old woman said at every meeting, "It wouldn't be unjust to die this time, I saw Chairman Mao and even shook hands with us representatives." Saying this, she smiled, and then said, "If it weren't for the Communist Party, we would be so poor, how could we have today!" Zhang Liansheng and Pei Yun, who stayed behind, knew that the old woman had returned and hurried to see her. They saw the old woman from afar and smiled and ran straight to her, and they warmly pulled her up. The old villagers, neighbors, uncles, aunts, and nieces surrounded her, asking this and that. Granny Zhang thought to herself that she had become famous this time, and she had to do a better job in the future. She was determined to go to various villages to hold meetings to mobilize women to produce. Coincidentally, the women's comrades from the county came, so she cooperated with them to carry out activities in the whole district. She held several large meetings in a row, and more and more women participated in production every day. As Qingming Festival was approaching, the old woman carried a manure basket to promote and mobilize the masses to plant trees everywhere. She often said to the villagers, "A thousand trees in the family, no need to walk around everywhere." She took her two daughters to plant them, and the village's task of planting more than a thousand trees was successfully completed. She also constantly called on women to raise pigs and chickens. The whole village bought more than eight hundred, with an average of two per person for the four hundred women in the whole village, which greatly increased the sideline production.

　　In the spring, she mobilized the masses to fetch water, in groups here and there. In less than a few days, forty-nine families planted cotton. Granny said, "There is nothing in the world that cannot be done, as long as you put in the effort, there will be no difficulties!" As a result, this wounded soldiers' mom was also elected as a county production model.

　　伤员的妈
    耸矗
    平谷五区许家坞的张景春大娘，×部医院六百多伤员，都敬爱的管她叫妈。张大娘今年五十五岁，家里老两口子，两个儿子和两个闺女。过去家里的日子很难过，房无一间、地无一垄，整天的缺吃少穿的在泪水中过生活。男人成年去唐山下煤窑，卖苦力，大儿子从小就给地主扛活，小儿子群头刚三岁送给兴隆庄一个庙里当和尚，两个闺女没法养活，都童养出去了。她给峪口永远堂财主家当老妈，穷苦的日子逼得她全家骨肉离散，到了民国三十二年，狠心的地主嫌她年老不要她了，童养出去的闺女和当和尚的儿子也都被退回来，她只得领着几个孩子在风雪里去要饭吃。她这愁死愁活的日子，就这样的熬着过。到了民国三十五年，共产党实行土地改革，穷人分了房子分了地，张大娘一家这才翻了身。她常和家里人说：“共产党帮助咱们翻了身，救了咱们全家！”翻身后，便送她大儿子参了军，她在村当选为妇女会主任。她干工作积极负责，尤其在拥军工作上，作了全村的好榜样。去年十一月十二日，×部野战医院来到这村中，张大娘象热爱自己儿女一样爱护伤员，当伤员刚来时，她整整伺候了十天十夜没有休息。每天她都亲身到各病房看两、三遍，哪天都是三星大偏西才回去睡觉，累得她两只脚出了好几个大泡。可是她从来没有说过累，也没有嫌过麻烦，她不分昼夜，给伤员接尿、接屎、擦脓、擦血、拿虱子、洗伤口，伤员吃饭喝水她亲身去喂，每次都是先尝尝凉热，再送到伤员的嘴里。有一天夜里快鸡叫了，天气很冷，又是伸手不见掌的月黑天，她刚躺下要睡，就听见住在陈治友家里的重伤员要水喝，她赶紧起来，烧了两壶开水，亲身送去一口一口的喂下去，感动的那伤员落下泪说：“您真比我妈还亲”。她怕伤员痛苦想家，不论到哪一家病房时都是婉言安慰，伤员见了她都是欢天喜地的舍不得她走，张大娘总怕伤员的嘴受屈（吃不着想吃的东西），有时把家中的新鲜食物给伤员送去或请到家里吃。在腊月十六那天，家里杀了一口准备过年的小肥猪，她把煮好的猪蹄、肥肠送给新伤员吃，伤员不吃，她心里很难过。她对伤员就当自己儿子看待，她说：“你们辛辛苦苦为咱们打仗流血，我宁可家里不吃也不能叫你们受委屈！”
    她的家就好象伤员的家，她和两个闺女天天给伤员缝洗，把自己的破衣服拆了打了七板夹纸给伤员们做鞋子、帽子，就在去年腊月当中，母女三人给伤员拆洗四十多件血衣服，补袜子三十多双，作领套一百多条，袜套二十多双，还给伤员作了一条棉裤，补了三双袜子。她的男人也和她一样的伺候水伺候饭和问冷问热，常替伤员上集买东西，张大娘对庄里人说：“要不是共产党救我，要不是他们（伤员）打仗，我还得要饭吃，一家人永也团圆不了！”
    由于她对待伤员这样的关心爱护，感动的两个所六百多个伤员都管他叫妈妈。去年腊月二十四她累病了，感动全所的工作休养员，都派来代表看望、送礼，三连送给她点心，二连送给她挂面，一连送给她柿子和大酸梨。所里的医生们说她病了，连饭都没吃赶来治病。大年初一的那天全所上下的同志都给张大娘拜年。
    过了年，那里有个别伤员，为了消遣解闷，斗牌吵了一架，被她知道了，慈颜悦色地把他们批评了一顿，伤员们都尊尊敬敬的接受他的批评。其中一个伤员感动的说：“妈！对不起你，以后再也不干这种事了！”今年正月有一部养好的伤员出院回前线，临走向她告别说：“您这样关心我们，我们永也忘记不了，这次回前线一定杀敌立功来报答您！”
    张大娘不但是爱护伤员的模范，还是一个劳动模范，家里的活计从来不叫村中代耕，分得十三亩地，都是她和闺女耕种锄耩（因她男人下煤窑累坏了不能干重活）。闲时候就和两个闺女纺线，三辆纺车每天纺一斤多，只前年一年就纺了百斤线。去年夏天还钉大鞋底子卖了四十多双，她的名子传遍了平谷县，提起她来没有不敬佩的。二月在全县选举县妇女代表会上，提出选举县妇代表出席冀东妇女代表大会，得选好样的，真给人民办事的，大会经过二天酝酿，大家瞅着张景春大娘说：“人家才真有功劳呢，就说伺候伤员们不分黑日白夜尿一把屎一把的，救活多少重伤号哇！”代表们都说：“就选她老人家比谁都强”，有的说：“反正我不选别人，就选张景春老大娘呀！”酝酿成熟后，她光荣的当选为县妇代表和县妇联执行委员，出席冀东妇代选举大会。
    张大娘当选后，心里想这么大年纪当了代表，县上的区里的男同志女同志见到都亲亲热热的，起心眼真欢喜，她决定回村后更得努一把子劲，伤员还要照顾好，大生产也得上点劲。
    不久，她出席冀东妇代选举大会后，接着又出席了全国妇代大会，家里住的伤员可等的心焦了，象失去亲爱的母亲似的。伤员张连生对伙伴的伤员们说：“妈开会去啦，半个月就会回来。”另一个伤员说：“好好养伤吧！伤口就好了，好去给妈作活，她老人家回来一定欢喜。”说后，伤好的战士，都去给她作活，老大娘没在家，可是家里活却都想的周周到到，捣粪送粪，脱坯搭炕，春耕也准备的很好。
    卫生所在这村住了三、四个月，部队要南下，卫生所也要随着转移，伤员有的留在分区卫生所，有的跟着医院走了。张连生和佩云因病重跟上级要求等大娘回来再走，上级就答复了。其他伤员临走时，心里总是有点难舍，有的含着眼泪离开了许家坞。伤员们走后老大娘虽未在家，可是信不断地来，她的老闺女都给它留起来。过了几天，伤员老唐、王洪、魏海、刘贵等，出所时候，欢天喜地的来看不分昼夜把他们伺候活了的张景春老大娘，刚一进庄，听说老大娘出席全国妇代大会了，他们都留下个好走了。走上前方的战士，不断地给她来信，还报告胜利消息，不到两个月，信收到六十多封。
    全国妇代会结束，老大娘回来了，分区县上一直到区村，都夹道开会欢迎，老大娘在每个会上都说：“这回死了也不冤，见到了毛主席，还和我们代表握手。”说着，就笑起来，紧接就说：“要不是共产党，我们这穷，那有今天！”留下的伤员张连生和佩云等，知道老大娘回来，连忙赶去看她，离着老远看见老大娘就笑着直奔上去，他们亲亲热热的拉起来。全村的老乡亲邻三叔三嫂，侄媳妇把她团团围住，问这个又问那个。张老大娘心里想，这回可出名啦，今后工作更得做好，打定主义，到各村开会发动妇女生产，恰巧县上来了妇女同志，于是她就配合着在全区活动起来，连续召开了几个大会，妇女参加生产一天比一天多起来。清明节快要到了，大娘背着一个粪箕子到处宣传发动群众植树，她经常对乡亲们说：“家里千棵树，不用满处走”。带着两个闺女去裁，全村千余棵植树任务顺利完成了。她还不断的号召妇女养猪、养鸡，全村买了八百多只，全村共四百多名妇女，每个人平均两只，大大地增加了副业生产。
    春天，她发动群众挑水，东一伙，西一拨，不到几天四十九家都种了棉花。大娘说：“世上那有做不成的事呀，只要下工夫，啥困难也没啦！”结果，这个伤员的妈又被选为全县生产模范。
