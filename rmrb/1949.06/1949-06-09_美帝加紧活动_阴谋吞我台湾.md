Xinhua News Agency, Peiping, 8th. American imperialist elements are increasingly and blatantly carrying out activities to annex Taiwan Province, Chinese territory. Former U.S. Deputy Consul in Taiwan, Feifeierde, recently published an article in the American "Foreign Policy Bulletin" magazine, advocating that the Kuomintang "government" declare Taiwan's incorporation into the U.S. Western Pacific "defense" system under appropriate circumstances. An Associated Press report from Washington on the 4th stated that U.S. officials and people from all walks of life deeply feel that in order to maintain the U.S.'s aggressive position in Taiwan and prevent it from being liberated by the Chinese People's Liberation Army, "it is necessary to take urgent decisions." The Associated Press said: Strategically speaking, Taiwan may become a key stronghold in the Asian "anti-communist cordon," which is currently being planned by Britain and the United States, starting from Japan in the north, passing through Taiwan in the middle, reaching the Philippines in the south, and then westward through Indonesia to India. A certain Guo, a pseudo-councilor of Taiwan Province, also revealed in a conversation on the 25th of last month that the Kuomintang's remaining bandit gang is preparing to "place Taiwan Province on an equal footing with the strategic bases of the United States and other countries, so that it can participate in the Pacific Joint Defense Organization." This conspiracy activity by American aggressors and their running dogs to undermine China's territorial sovereignty has aroused great attention from the Chinese people.

　　美帝加紧活动　阴谋吞我台湾
    【新华社北平八日电】美国帝国主义分子日益明目张胆地进行吞并中国领土台湾省的活动。美国前驻台副领事费菲尔德最近在美“外交政策公报”杂志上发表文章，主张国民党“政府”在适当情况下宣布将台湾并入美国西太平洋的“防御”体系。美国合众社于四日从华盛顿发出的报道中说，美国朝野人士深感为了保持美国在台湾的侵略地位而不为中国人民解放军所解放，“有采取紧急决定的必要”。合众社说：从战略上说来，台湾可能成为亚洲“反共隔断线”中的一个关键据点，这个“隔断线”是现在英美所规划的，北起日本，中经台湾，南至菲律宾，然后西向经印尼而至印度。台省伪参议员郭某在上月二十五日的谈话中也透露了国民党残余匪帮准备“将台省置于与美国及其他各国战略基地的平等地位，使其参加太平洋联防机构之内”。美国侵略者及其走狗这种破坏中国领土主权的阴谋活动，已引起中国人民的极大注意。
