　　Du Luojie and His Windbreak Forest
　　Li Hui Xin Zhenhua

　　North of Xiwang Village in Jin County, about ten miles from the Hutuo River, on the undulating sand dunes, one can see a dense cluster of green trees of varying heights. Willow branches intertwined, waving in the wind, their leaves rustling like wild songs. South of the sand dunes lies a field of green wheat, heavy with yellowish-green ears. Twenty years ago, this desolate and barren old sand dune has been transformed into a beautiful piece of land, the crystallization of the blood and sweat of the tree-planting hero Du Luojie.

　　Before this forest existed, the yellow sand from the Hutuo River, whipped up by the wind, threatened to bury more than 3,000 mu of fertile land north of the village. The farmland and wells all faced the danger of being leveled by the sand.

　　In the 21st year of the Republic of China (1932), Du Luojie, a poor peasant, was already 49 years old. In the old society, he couldn’t live a "human" life; things were always getting tighter, and he had mortgaged his few good water fields to the landlord Du Luoliang. His family of four lived in hunger, cold, poverty, and destitution. For his survival, he started planting trees on this sand dune where "not even a blade of grass could grow." During the rainy season, he would cut branches to weigh down the seedlings, transplanting them into the sand. Every day, from morning to night, through wind and rain, he would press the small seedlings into the loose quicksand. At first, no one believed they could survive. However, Luojie and his young nephew (Yuntang) dug out an old well south of the dunes that had been buried for many years, drew water, and watered the trees as they planted the seedlings. They planted almost 400 trees every day. After planting so diligently for over a decade, on the thirty-qing sand field, he had planted and brought to life more than 20,000 trees including poplar, willow, jujube, elm, and apricot, creating a windbreak forest where green trees cast their shade.

　　The working people will eventually conquer nature. The flying sand blowing in from the north was stopped by the trees and grass roots, freeing the fertile land south of the dunes from the danger of being buried. Luojie's labor was rewarded. In the middle of the forest, he built three low earthen houses, and his family of four lived there with the trees they loved and the ten plump chickens they raised, living a pastoral life in the wild.

　　From the Lugouqiao Incident to the "May 1st Great Sweep," the Japanese invaders brought disaster to the people. Japanese strongholds were established within five li of Xiwang Village. There was constant burning, killing, looting, and conscription. This forest became a natural fortress. County and district guerrilla队员s often lay in ambush in the woods to attack the Japanese. Every night, Luojie's hut became the most convenient place for cadres to hold meetings. Day in and day out, in wind and rain, he disrupted the enemy's five intensifications of public security and persisted through the brutal struggle of "May 1st." Once, the district squad injured a Japanese soldier and six warhorses. This forest became a thorn in the side of the Japanese. Soon, the Japanese concentrated more than two hundred soldiers and launched a retaliatory sweep of the forest, seizing clothes, bedding, and timber hidden in the forest by him and the villagers. They also took dozens of his chickens and destroyed the beehives. When Luojie recalled the many past sufferings and struggles, he said with regret and indignation, "This was all done by the Japanese devils. Several trees as thick as bowls were about to become timber, but the bastards cut them down to build blockhouses. One day, when I was catching tree worms, I was captured by the Japanese, who poked several holes in my cotton coat." As he spoke, he looked at the empty sand field where trees had been cut down, and tears welled up in his eyes. Then he added, "The Japanese disaster wasn't the only thing. That year, it didn't rain until June, and there was a locust plague. People were so hungry they were seeing stars. The women and children in our village survived the famine by mixing leaves from this forest with a little grain flour." He pointed to the wild pear trees, littleleaf poplar trees, and elm trees, saying, "That year, the leaves of those old trees became people's food. Were there any people who starved to death in that village? Not in our village..." Then he said very affirmatively, "We got through those difficult years. This year, even if it doesn't rain, with our government providing loans for seeds and fertilizer, as long as we put in the effort to plant seedlings, we won't be afraid..."

　　Indeed, the story of Luojie planting trees to combat drought, resist the enemy, and survive the famine spread like a myth.

　　"Du Luojie is truly capable,
　　Planting trees and making forests, a true hero.
　　During the May 1st Great Sweep,
　　He sheltered us in our struggle.
　　The forest north of the village is a great fortress,
　　Tree leaves helped us survive the famine,
　　Saving us from the pit of fire.
　　He is our savior!"

　　After the Japanese surrender, the government called for increased production. Luojie was selected as a "tree-planting hero." County Magistrate Wang invited him to a meeting, where he said, "He suffered from poverty since childhood, and started planting trees at the age of 49; 'It takes ten years to grow a tree, but a hundred years to nurture a person.' It didn't take ten years for him to reap the benefits. Everyone is short of firewood, and I used to sell firewood. During the 'May 1st Great Sweep,' the Japanese disaster, the locust plague, and the lack of rain, that year, I sold over four thousand jin of tree branches and over two thousand jin of *Diding* grass (the grass he planted in his forest), which translated to six *shi* of grain. Mixed with a little tree leaf, we survived that crisis." He also said, "The government implemented a unified progressive tax system, and barren land planted with trees is exempt from taxes. The year the land was returned, I got back my seven mu of irrigated land, my lifeline." Recalling the heroic meeting at that time, the old man was both excited and happy.

　　With the land returned to its original owners, plus the growth of the trees, the benefits gradually increased. Luojie's circumstances had already improved, and he was living a prosperous middle-peasant life through hard work. He sells more than three thousand jin of *Diding* grass and more than five thousand jin of tree branches every year. Last year alone, tree seedlings brought him four *shi* of millet. When the government needed utility poles, he cut down ten poplar trees that were big enough for timber and asked his son Zengfa to send them, receiving four hundred and fifty jin of millet in return. In the past two or three years, the jujube trees have been yielding more than a dozen bags of jujubes each year. In another two or three years, the peach and apricot trees will also bear fruit.

　　The working people are kind and passionate. He planted trees not only for his own convenience, but also the boatmen from the villages of Xiugu, Fangyuan, and Bingche, near the river, often came to Brother Luojie's forest to select the tallest and straightest poplar trees for boat poles. Luojie always gave them to them enthusiastically, saying, "These are our own, it's nothing." Five old boatmen from Dibei Village once gave him six jin (two bottles) of wine and two fish (eight jin), and once they even gave him a large basket of noodles. The boatmen who plied the Hutuo River often said, "Xiwang Village has Brother Luojie's large tree farm, so it's not difficult to find a boat pole." When the masses in the village planted trees using seedlings and repaired farm tools, they treated the supplies as if they were their own, and went to Luojie for whatever they needed, and he never asked for a single cent.

　　"Like father, like son." His son, Zengfa, was elected as the village's tree-planting committee member this year. He and Gensheng, Lanxue, and a dozen other young people formed a tree-planting team, leading the masses of the whole village. From last winter to this spring, they have planted more than 25,000 trees of various types, including poplar, willow, peach, elm, apricot, and jujube trees.

　　Luojie's tree planting educated the people of Xiwang Village. In recent years, more than 60,000 trees of various types have grown on the 30-qing wide sandy field north of the village. Dong Laoli and Du Laokui have planted and brought to life more than 20,000 trees. In the courtyards, streets, and near the wells of Xiwang Village, one can see newly planted small trees of various kinds, growing luxuriantly.

　　In the warm and sunny early summer month of April, clusters of trees envelop the democratic and free Xiwang Village, making it appear even more vibrant, beautiful, and lovable!

　　杜洛杰与他的防风林
    李辉　辛振华
    在晋县西旺村北，滹沱河南十里远近的地方，起伏的沙岗上，可望见一片高矮浓密的绿树木丛。杨柳枝条综错着迎风招展，树叶奏起沙沙的狂歌，沙岗南边是一片碧绿的麦田，都结着黄绿的长穗。二十年前这枯寂荒凉的老沙岗，今天却变成一片美好的田地，这就是种树英雄杜洛杰的血汗结晶。
    当没有这片树林的时候，狂风卷起滹沱河的黄沙，已经要淹没村北三千多亩良田。禾田水井都面临着被沙淤平的危险。
    民国二十一年，贫农杜洛杰已四十九岁了，旧社会里那里能使他过什么“人”的日子，总是越过越紧，把自己仅有的几亩好水地，押给了地主杜洛良。全家大小四口，终日过着饿寒贫困的日子，为了自己的生存，就在这块“寸草不收”的沙岗上种起树来。每逢雨水连绵的季节，他便砍树枝压秧，移秧栽树，每天都是从早到晚，风里雨里，把细小的秧条，压在松软的流沙里。起初谁也不相信能栽活；可是洛杰和自己的小侄子（运堂），把岗南淤埋多年的老旧井挖出水来，便用水浇树栽秧。差不多每日要种四百棵。这样辛苦的连续栽种十数年，三十顷的沙场上，栽活了杨、柳、枣、榆、杏等树两万多棵，成了绿树成荫的防风林。
    劳动的人民终于会战胜自然的，从北方吹来的飞沙，都被树林和草根阻止了，使岗南的良田摆脱了淹淤的危险。洛杰的劳动得到了酬报，在树林的中间，盖了三间矮矮的土房，全家四口，就伴着这心爱的树木，和养着的十只肥胖的鸡儿，过了一段野外林牧生活。
    芦沟桥事变一直到“五一大扫荡”，日寇给人民带来了灾难，西旺村方圆五里都安上了鬼子的据点，不断的烧、杀、抢、掠、抓壮丁…。这块树林成了自然的堡垒。县区游击队队员们时常伏在林丛里打鬼子的伏击。每到晚上，洛杰的小屋里，便成了干部开会最便当的场所。成天价风里来，雨里去，扰乱了敌人的五次强化治安，依靠他坚持了“五一”残酷斗争。有一次，区小队曾打伤过一个鬼子，六匹战马。这树林成了鬼子的眼中钉。不久，日寇便集中二百多个鬼子，向树林里来了个报复扫荡。抢走他和老乡们隐蔽在树林里的衣服被褥木料。还捉走他那几十只鸡，捣毁了蜜蜂房。当洛杰想起以前许多痛苦和斗争的时候，又惋惜又气愤的说：“这都是狗日本干的，几十棵碗口大的树眼看要成木材了，被王八崽子们砍去修了碉堡。有一天我正在捉树虫的时候，被鬼子捉住，把棉衣挑了好几个窟窿。”他说着望了望被砍去树木的空沙场，眼里津出了泪珠。接着他又说：“光鬼子灾还不算，那年到六月里才下雨又闹蚂蚱，人们都饿的眼发蒙了。俺村里娘们、孩子全靠将这树林里的叶子掺上点谷面吃就熬过了荒年。”他又指着杜梨树、小叶杨树、榆树说：”那年象这老树的叶子都成了人们的粮食。那村没饿死的人？俺村没有……“接着他又很肯定的说：“那么难过的年头都过了。今年不下雨，有了咱政府还贷种贷肥料，只要肯费劲点种上苗就不怕……”
    的确，洛杰种树抗旱抗敌渡荒的史迹，象神话的流传着。
    “杜洛杰呀真是行，
    种树造林当英雄。
    五一大扫荡，
    掩护作斗争。
    村北树林大堡垒，
    树叶渡荒年，
    救咱出火坑。
    他是咱们的救命星！”
    日本投降后，政府号召大生产，洛杰被选为“种树英雄”，王县长请他去开会，在会上说：“自小就受穷，四十九岁即种树；‘十年树木百年树人’没十年就沾上光了。谁家都缺柴，我倒卖柴火。象‘五一大扫荡’时候，鬼子灾蚂蚱灾天不下雨，我那年卖了四千斤树枝子，和二千多斤地丁草（他树林里种的草）折腾了六石粮，再掺上点树叶，就遨过了这一关。”还说：“政府实行统累税荒地种树不拿差。土地回赎那年，我那命根子七亩水浇地赎回来了。”老头回忆起那时的英雄会上情况，又兴奋又愉快。
    土地回老家，再加上树木的成长，受益日渐增多，洛杰的光景已经是劳动发家过起富足的中农生活了。他每年卖地丁草三千多斤，树枝五千多斤，树秧光去年就折腾了四石小米。政府要电杆子，他曾砍了一十棵够材的杨树，叫他儿增发送去，领回四百五十斤小米。枣树近两三年来，每年已能收十几袋枣，再过二三年，桃杏树也能结果子了。
    劳动人民是温厚热爱的，他种树不只自己方便，连靠河边的修古、方远、兵车等村的船工们，常到树林里靠洛杰哥，挑选最高最直的杨树当船篙。洛杰每次都是很热情的送给他们，并说：“这是咱自己的，不算什么。”堤北村的五个老船工，有一次曾送给他六斤（两瓶）酒，两条鱼（八斤），有一次还送给他一大篮子挂面。滹沱河上摆船的船工们常说：“西旺村有洛杰哥的大树场，使个船篙不作难。”本村群众栽树用秧和修制农具时，都象使自己的一样，找洛杰去要，他却从没有要过一文钱。
    “父是英雄儿好汉”他儿子增发，今年当选为村植树委员后，曾和根生、兰学等十几个青年成立了种树班，带动全村群众，由去冬今春已先后种杨、柳、桃、榆、杏、枣等树两万五千多棵。
    洛杰的种树教育了西旺村的人们，近几年来，在村北三十顷的广沙场上，已长起了各种树六万多棵，董老礼、杜老奎就种活两万多棵。西旺村的院里、街里、近井台上、到处都可以看到新栽的各样小树，在茂盛的生长着。
    当风和日暖，夏初的四月里，一簇簇的树丛，笼罩着民主自由的西旺村，使他更显得生气勃勃美丽可爱了！
