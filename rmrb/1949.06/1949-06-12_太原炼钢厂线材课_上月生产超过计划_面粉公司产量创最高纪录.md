　　【Taiyuan Electric】The Taiyuan Steel Plant's Wire Rod Section's May production has exceeded the plan. The original plan was to produce 5,000 kilograms of wire nails and 21,600 kilograms of iron wire. Due to the workers' active production, even though there were two days of power outages in between, the total May production reached 5,220 kilograms of wire nails and 21,877 kilograms of iron wire, both exceeding the original production plan. The aluminum plating department of this section was established in February of last year, but because the Yan bandit gang used all the wire rod section for military power grids, and the aluminum plating furnace, hydrochloric acid pool, heating furnace, etc., malfunctioned, it had been shut down a year ago. After we took over, we immediately mobilized engineers and all workers to carry out repairs. The workers all voluntarily requested to work overtime and extend working hours, and resumed work on May 2nd. During the Yan bandit rule, one ton of aluminum was plated every twelve hours, now one ton can be plated every ten hours.

　　【Also Electric】The production volume of Taiyuan's current public-owned factories is gradually increasing. The daily output of the No. 1 blast furnace of the Northwest Steel Plant's ironmaking section has exceeded more than three times that before liberation. During the Yan bandit rule, the daily output of this furnace was ten to twenty tons; now it has increased to more than seventy tons.

　　【Also Electric】The Taiyuan Flour Company's product quantity and quality are improving daily. When the factory first resumed work, the head of the engineering section and the technicians lacked confidence in the plan to "complete the repairs in twenty days"; but the workers, after liberation, established the sense of being masters of their own affairs, and their enthusiasm for production increased. At the symposium, they unanimously guaranteed that "it can be completed in fifteen days." In reality, it only took fourteen days for all the factory's machines to start running. In the past, Feiluo flour often mixed with bran, resulting in unclean bran and slowing down the machine's rotation, reducing flour production. After careful research by the technicians, a flour pipe was changed, so that all the Feiluo flour returned to the round sieve. After the trial, the machine's rotation speed increased, the output increased, and the bran was also clean. During the Yan bandit rule, the highest daily output was 1,600 bags (44 jin per bag), while on the 28th of last month, it reached 1,760 bags, creating an unprecedented record high. Research and improvement are still continuing, and the workers' slogan is: "Strive to achieve the production plan of 2,000 bags per day."

### 太原炼钢厂线材课　上月生产超过计划　面粉公司产量创最高纪录

　　太原炼钢厂线材课
  　上月生产超过计划
  　面粉公司产量创最高纪录
    【太原电】太原炼钢厂线材课五月份生产已超过计划。原计划生产洋钉五千公斤，铁丝二万一千六百公斤；由于职工积极生产，中间虽停电两天，而五月共生产洋钉达五千二百二十公斤，铁丝二万一千八百七十七公斤，都超过了原订生产计划。该课镀铝部于去年二月建立，但因阎匪将线材课全部用于制军用电网，再加镀铝炉、盐酸池、加热炉等发生故障，故于一年前即已停工，我接管后，即发动工程师与全体职工进行修理，职工们都自动要求加工、延长工时，亦于五月二日复工。阎匪统治时代，每十二小时镀铝一吨，现每十小时即可镀铝一吨。
    【又电】太原目前公营工厂的生产量逐渐增高，西北炼钢厂炼铁课一高炉的日产量，已超过解放前的三倍多。在阎匪统治期间该炉日产量为十吨至二十吨；现增至七十余吨。
    【又电】太原面粉公司产品数、质量均日渐提高。当该厂复工之初，工务课长和技师们对“二十天完成修复工作”的计划都缺乏信心；而工人们在解放后因树立了主人翁的思想，生产情绪提高，在座谈会上，一致保证“十五天就可完成”。而实际只费了十四天的时间，全厂机器就转动起来了。过去飞罗面常混入麦皮道内，致使麦皮不洁，且迟缓了机器的转动，降低面粉产量。经技工们细心研究，改换了一个面管，使飞罗面全归入圆罗。试行后，机器转动速度加快，产量提高，且麦皮也干净了。在阎匪统治期间，最高日产量一千六百袋（每袋四十四斤），而在上月二十八日则已达一千七百六十袋，创造了空前的最高纪录。现仍在继续研究改进，工友们的口号是：“为实现日产二千袋的生产计划而努力”。
