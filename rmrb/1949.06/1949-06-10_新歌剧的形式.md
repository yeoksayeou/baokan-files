　　The Form of New Opera
　　Sang Fu
　　The form of new opera is a very important issue at present, especially in the handling of urban life, there are many areas to explore. I think the form of new opera should have its own characteristics, which can be summarized as: mass character, dance-drama character, and simplification.

　　Mass character: Because new opera is developed from the old folk Yangko form, this form is familiar to the masses. Is the standard for testing mass character like this? The masses love it and can apply it, making this form their own. If the performance of a play cannot be understood by the masses, or can only be performed by professional troupes with high technical level, and the general masses or troupes feel it is difficult to use this form to perform, we must consider what is the essence of the difficulty? I think some of it is because the content is divorced from the masses, and the masses feel difficult because they do not understand it, and some of it is because the form is not loved or familiar to them and they feel difficult. Comrade Zhang Geng said in the preface to the "Yangko Selection": "After the emergence of this form of New Yangko, it soon became popular. During the two years of 1943 and 1944, the people in the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region, especially those who loved lively gatherings, all said in unison: 'Is that how the New Yangko is performed? Then we can also do it, so we will go back and organize a group of people to write scripts and perform them ourselves.'" This is a concrete reflection of the practice of the New Yangko movement in the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region. The improvement of New Yangko is based on this foundation. We should follow this path of popularization movement, so that the New Yangko movement can be promoted. In the process of popularization, we should discover and create new opera forms suitable for expressing urban life. Urban life is unfamiliar or alienated to us (literary and artistic workers who grew up in the liberated areas). Today, becoming familiar with cities (especially workers) should be a new and most important topic. Only by going deep can we popularize, and only then can we improve.

　　The New Yangko of the old liberated areas, when it spread to the cities, was a mirror and inspiration for the mass cultural movement in this region. It tells us the correct direction of how to come from the masses and how to go to the masses. As for some of its performance methods (dance steps, composition, drum beats, etc.), it only provides us with a successful example. More suitable performance methods for this region are waiting for our greater efforts. If we want to promote a certain region's performance method unchanged in Peiping, or consider it as the "orthodox" method, it cannot but be said to be a wrong point of view, because Northeast, North China, and Northwest China all have different characteristics, just as the lifestyles of cities and villages are different. Therefore, opera art must be popularized and improved on the basis of mass character.

　　Dance-drama character: We should affirm that singing and dancing are the main ways to express the lives of the characters in opera art. What is singing? What is dancing? As the name suggests, "singing" seems to be relatively easy to understand. It is not speaking, not dialogue, not recitation, but singing out rhythmically and melodically. Regarding dance, Comrade Shui Hua has this passage in an article "Several Issues on Yangko Opera" (originally published in Changcheng Issue 2, published in Zhangjiakou): "Dance must first have full emotions and active external movements. Without full emotions, the actor will not have an urge and motivation to raise the action to dance. Without external movements, of course, there can be no dance." This is how dance in opera is produced. Dance should be based on the character, personality, background, etc. Dance should have its purpose, so that dancing is not just a form.

　　At the same time, the image of dance is by no means limited to twisting, because what we usually see is that Yangko dance is always twisting, so sometimes we have a slightly fixed view of dance. This view should be eliminated. Dance is diverse and creative. Mastering certain emotions and making the movements clear and rhythmic is the initial form of dance. After repairing and refining, so that the actor's dance and the entire play are harmonized and unified, a perfect dance-drama will be produced. If it appears in the form of new opera, but lacks singing and dancing, it will be an elusive thing.

　　Of course, dealing with the singing and dancing problems in opera is a special problem, and it is a complex problem. For example, some people think that it is easier to handle dance in the wild environment (such as walking, in the courtyard, in the field, etc.), but it is impossible or difficult for several actors to dance in the house. Indeed, the latter is more difficult than the former, but the concept of dance should never be built on the environment, but should be how to unify real life through artistic images in the performance, and will not lose the artistry of dance just because it is danced in the house. Moreover, dance in opera is not always necessary in any situation. Whether the dance is successful depends on the actor's creation and the director's handling.

　　We often see that in some operas, actors enter the stage dancing, and after a few minutes they completely become a drama. Without knowing what is going on, he suddenly sings again, which makes people feel that singing and dancing become a burden in the play. This development is deformed. Therefore, we must affirm that singing and dancing are the main ways to express the lives of the characters in opera art, and are an organic part of the entire play (more specialized technical issues will be discussed later). The dances in the old operas are rich treasures worthy of our study, learning to master the methods of combining dance and music, and the laws of dance development.

　　Simplification: The greatest advantage of new opera is that it is not restricted by time and place, and uses a few simple and concise characteristics to outline complex life, and the effect obtained is still the same real. From the performance of "Brother and Sister Reclaiming Wasteland" to "The White-Haired Girl," this characteristic has been maintained. If the performance of "The White-Haired Girl" is handled in the performance method of drama, it will be an arduous and thankless thing, and there have been such examples. The reason is very simple. It is clear that a thing can be completed with a simple expression method. Why must the simple be made complicated?

　　The form of new opera should be a mass form, a creative form. It should not be a formalism that is divorced from the masses and starts from the form. At the same time, the purpose of imitating the old folk art is to be familiar with it, master it, so as to achieve the purpose of creation, and this creation is based on a deep understanding of real life and the absorption of the essence of folk art. Improvement cannot be separated from popularization. New opera should take a big step towards the path of mass character. We should affirm that this path is correct.

### 新歌剧的形式

　　新歌剧的形式
    桑夫
    新歌剧的形式，在目前是一个很重要的问题，尤其在表现城市生活的处理方法上，是有许多要探讨的地方，我想新歌剧的形式应该有它的特点，概括来讲就是：群众化、歌舞化、单纯化。
    群众化：因为新歌剧是由旧的民间秧歌形式发展过来的，这种形式是群众所熟悉的，测验群众化的标准是否是这样呢？群众喜爱它，而且能应用它，使这种形式成为群众自己的。假如说一个戏的演出，不能为群众所理解，或者说只能为技术水平较高的专业剧团所表现，而一般的群众或剧团，感到有困难利用这种形式演出时，我们就必须考虑感到困难的本质是什么？我想有的是因为内容脱离了群众，群众不理解而感到困难，一种是因为形式不为他们所喜爱或不熟悉而感到困难。张庚同志在“秧歌选集”的序言里有这样的话：“新秧歌这种形式出现之后，不久，很快的即普及开了，民国三十二年、三十三年这两年中间，陕甘宁边区的老百姓，特别是爱红火会耍的人，都异口同声的说：“新秧歌就是这样闹的么？那我们也会闹，就回去组织起一班人自己编起剧本演起来了。”这是陕甘宁边区新秧歌运动实践的具体反映，新秧歌的提高是基于这种基础的。我们应当遵循这条普及运动的道路，使新秧歌运动推广下去，在普及的过程中，去发现创作适合于表现城市生活的新歌剧的形式，城市生活对于我们（在解放区成长的文艺工作者）是不熟悉的，或者说是疏远了。在今天熟悉城市（尤其是工人）应该是一个新的最重要的课题，只有深入下去，才能普及，也才能提高。
    老解放区的新秧歌，流传到城市里来，对于这个地区的群众文艺运动是一个借镜、启示。它告诉我们怎样从群众中来，又怎样到群众中去的正确方向，至于它的一些表现方法（舞步、构图、鼓点等），只是提供了我们一个成功的范例。而更适合于本地区的表现方法，有待于我们更大的努力。假如要把某个地区的表现方法，原封不动在北平推广下去，或者认为是“正统”的方法，不能不说是一种错误的观点，困为东北、华北、西北，各地区都有不同的特点的，正象城市与乡村生活方式不同是一样的道理。因此，歌剧艺术要在群众化的基础上去普及，去提高。
    歌舞化：我们应该肯定歌舞在歌剧艺术里是表现剧中人物生活的主要方式。什么是歌？什么是舞呢？顾名思意，“歌”好象是比较容易理解的，不是说话、不是道白、不是朗诵、有节奏有旋律的唱出来就是歌吧。关于舞，水华同志在“关于秧歌剧的几个问题”（原文载长城二期，张家口出版）一文中有这样一段：“舞首先必须有饱满的情绪和活跃的外形动作，没有饱满的情绪，演员就不会有一种要求把动作提高到舞的冲动和动力，没有外形动作当然就不可能有舞了。”歌剧里的舞是这样产生的，舞应该是根据人物、性格、出身等等而来的，舞应该有它的目的性，这样舞起来才不只是一个形式。
    同时，舞蹈的形象，绝不仅限于扭一扭，因为平常所看到的，跳秧歌舞都是那么扭扭，所以有时对舞的观念也稍有定型的看法。这种看法是应该取消的，舞蹈是多样的，创作的，掌握了一定的情绪，使动作明朗起来，节奏化，这就是舞的初型，再经过修理、洗炼，使演员的舞蹈和整个的戏调合统一起来，就会产生完美的歌舞剧，假如以新歌剧的形式出现，而缺少了歌与舞，那将是不可捉摸的东西。
    当然，在处理歌剧里的歌舞问题，是个专门问题，而且是个复杂问题，例如：有人认为舞蹈处理在野外的环境容易（如走路、院子里、田野里等），而要几个演员在房子里舞起来，就不可能，或是感到困难。的确，后者是比前者困难，但舞蹈的观念绝不应建立在环境上，而应该是如何把现实生活通过艺术形象，统一在表演中，并不会因为是在房子里舞起来，就丧失了舞蹈的艺术性。而且，歌剧里的舞蹈，并不是任何情形下都非舞不成的，舞蹈的成功与否？就要看演员的创作与导演的处理如何了。
    我们常看到有些歌剧开场时，演员跳着舞步登场，而几分钟之后就完全变成了话剧。在不知什么情形下，他又忽然唱起来，这样就使人感到歌舞成为剧中的累赘品，这种发展是畸形的。因此，我们要肯定歌舞在歌剧艺术里是表现剧中人物生活的主要方式，是整个戏组成的有机部份（更专门的技术问题，留待以后再研讨）。旧剧里的舞蹈，是值得我们学习的丰富的宝藏，学习掌握舞蹈与音乐结合的方法，舞蹈发展的规律。
    单纯化：新歌剧最大的长处，他不受时间、地点限制，而把复杂的生活，用几个简单扼要的特点构画出来，而所得到的效果还是一样的真实，从“兄妹开荒”到“白毛女”的演出，都保持了这特点。假如把“白毛女”的演出以话剧的表现方法去处理，那会是一个吃力不讨好的事情，而且是有过这样的实例的，道理很简单，明明一件事情可以用单纯的表现方法去完成，为什么一定要把简单的搞成复杂呢？
    新歌剧的形式应该是群众化的形式，创作性的形式，它不应该是脱离群众，从形式出发的形式主义。同时，对旧有民间艺术模拟的目的，是为了熟悉它，掌握它，以达到创作的目的，而这种创作又是基于对现实生活的深入了解，与对民间艺术精华的吸取而来的，提高离不开普及的，新歌剧应该向群众化的道路大步迈进，这条道路我们应该肯定是正确的。
