Title: Resolution of the Twelfth Plenary Session of the Council of the Soviet Writers' Union on Drama and Film

　　The historically significant resolution of the Central Committee of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) "On the Repertoire of Theaters and Measures for Improving It" has had a beneficial impact on the development of Soviet drama and on raising its ideological and artistic level.

　　After the promulgation of the resolution of the Central Committee of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks), some scripts appeared in theaters across the country: these scripts raised important issues of modernity, explored the life phenomena of Soviet society in its movement towards communism, and demonstrated the labor achievements and combat achievements of the Soviet people.

　　The following scripts should be attributed to this type of dramatic work: Romanov's "Great Power," Simonov's "The Russian Question," Chirskov's "The Victors," Virta's "Our Daily Bread" and "In One Country," Jakobson's "Fortress Life" and "Fight Without a Front," Sofronov's "In One City" and "Moscow Character," Surov's "Great Destiny," Korneichuk's "Makar Dubrava," Grigulis' "Clay and Porcelain," Birvintsev's "Southern Railway Junction," Stein's "Law of Honor," Movson's "Konstantin Zaslonov," Lyubimova's "Little Snow," Mikhalkov's "Red Tie," Demeterko's "General Vatutin," Mamedkhanly's "Morning of the East," Abishev's "United Family," Brodler's "Spring in Hechuan," and several other scripts.

　　However, while pointing out these preliminary achievements in implementing the instructions of the Central Committee of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks), the plenary session still believes that the current situation in Soviet drama is not satisfactory. Soviet theaters do not have enough scripts with high ideological quality and artistic skill. The backwardness of Soviet drama has become an obstacle to the further upsurge of Soviet dramatic culture.

　　The Presidium and Secretariat of the Writers' Union failed to mobilize writers to implement the resolution of the Central Committee of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) on the repertoire of theaters, failed to attract outstanding writers from across the country to engage in writing scripts, failed to lead writers in creating dramatic works, and also failed to provide them with creative assistance.

　　Especially impermissible is the fact that young writers who have entered the field of drama in the past two years have not received the necessary assistance from the Secretariat and Presidium of the Writers' Union.

　　As a result of this important department of Soviet literature falling outside the vision of the Secretariat of the Writers' Union, some thoughtless and inartistic scripts have recently appeared on the stages of national theaters and in publications. Some of these scripts (N. Pogodin's "Velvet Season," V. Solovyov's "Conscience") are direct distortions of Soviet life and distortions of the typical Soviet people; some scripts (Polyakov's "Did Not Wait," Fink's "University Students," Maas and Chervinsky's "About Comrade Friends," Galich and Isaev's "The Taimyr Peninsula Calls You," Uspensky's "Three Friends"), due to their low ideological and artistic level, cannot meet the increased needs of Soviet audiences in any way.

　　Playwrights and theaters did not pay attention to an instruction of the Central Committee of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks), which said that in several scripts staged in 1945-46, Soviet people "are depicted in the form of deformed caricatures, primitive and uncultured, with vulgar tastes and habits; the negative characters are given more obvious characteristics of character, are shown to be powerful, willful, and very sophisticated. The events in these scripts are often depicted imaginatively and fictitiously, and therefore, these scripts create an incorrect and distorted impression of Soviet life."

　　At the same time, translations of scripts by Western bourgeois liberal writers have appeared on theater stages, and these translated scripts have no ideological and artistic value for Soviet audiences.

　　The Art Committee has not yet taken decisive measures to have the scripts of Soviet playwrights directed by excellent directors and to have first-class actors perform plays on modern themes.

　　The plenary session pointed out the lack of diversity in the themes of Soviet social life raised by Soviet playwrights in their scripts. There are no works that express the labor achievements of the Soviet people. The struggle of workers and collective farmers to complete the post-war Five-Year Plan and consolidate the power of the Soviet state is not depicted sufficiently on the stage. The ideological struggle to uphold the advanced Soviet materialist viewpoint in science (for example, in biology, medicine, etc.) and to oppose the hostile and backward idealist viewpoints of modern Western European and American bourgeois scholars has not been reflected in the works of Soviet playwrights. Various manifestations of subservience to the bourgeois West still exist in the backward Soviet intellectual class; these manifestations have only been exposed and ridiculed in a very small number of scripts. The theme of combating these manifestations of subservience, the education of Soviet patriotism, remains one of the main themes of drama.

　　The Writers' Union and its Drama Committee have not set the task of mastering specialized skills and improving the artistic level of works for playwrights. In many scripts, writers stereotype life phenomena when observing them, without ideological and artistic profound generalizations. Often, there are themes that are raised correctly in the scripts, but the great ideas of the themes are not embodied in the characters and personal destinies of the protagonists. The result of all this is that these scripts cannot interest Soviet audiences due to their insufficient artistic level and are quickly removed from the repertoire.

　　The most important reason for the above-mentioned weaknesses of Soviet drama is still the insufficient connection between writers and playwrights and the modern life and labor of workers, collective farmers, and intellectuals. Only by deeply familiarizing oneself with modern life, familiarizing oneself with the real conflicts arising in the conflict between the new and the old, and deeply familiarizing oneself with our Soviet readers can Soviet drama embark on the broad road of socialist art.

　　The plenary session especially pointed out the unsatisfactory situation of dramatic criticism. "Drama" magazine (edited by Comrade Karashnikov) and "Soviet Art" newspaper (edited by Comrade Vdovichenko) often provide space for formalist, snobbish, and alien criticisms to Soviet art.

　　The dramatic criticism group of the All-Russian Theater Society and the Drama Committee of the Writers' Union have gathered some critics who stand on the position of artistic non-participation in political life, which the Party has condemned, and they adhere to this position in more or less open or disguised forms. These critics (Gurvich, Yuzovsky, Malyugin, etc.) attempt to discredit the positive phenomena of Soviet drama from formalist and aesthetic viewpoints, less openly in publications and more openly in various meetings of the All-Russian Theater Society and in the Central House of Literature. The emergence of any scripts that reflect our reality, and the heroic achievements of Soviet people on the battlefronts of the Patriotic War and in the post-war socialist construction period, are hated by these critics. They are especially hostile to young writers entering the field of drama.

　　These critics attempt to shake the confidence of theaters in modern Soviet themes, lead Soviet audiences in the wrong direction, and hinder the development of the creative talents of many playwrights facing modern themes. Among these critics, there is a cultivation of subservience to Western bourgeois culture, contempt for the richest heritage of Russian classical drama, and a nihilistic attitude towards the extensive experience of the Soviet period.

　　The plenary session pointed out that there is still a sectarian relationship among dramatic critics. In the articles written by these critics in the "Soviet Art" newspaper and "Drama" magazine, and in their speeches at the All-Russian Theater Society and the Writers' Union meetings, "their evaluation of scripts and performances is not guided by the interests of the ideological and artistic development of Soviet drama and performing arts, that is to say, not guided by the interests of the state and the people, but by sectarian, friendly, and personal interests" (Resolution of the Central Committee of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) on the repertoire of theaters).

　　A part of Soviet drama critics (Porshyakovsky, Boyadzhev, Varshavsky) are in fact bound by formalist and aesthetic criticism; other critics (Altman, Kholodov) take a conciliatory attitude towards this alien view of script creation and performing arts. Thus, the past and present work of critics who stand on the position of non-participation in political life, on the position of "pure art" and "art for art's sake," has not yet been exposed and criticized.

### 苏联作家协会理事会第十二次全会　关于戏剧电影的决议

　　苏联作家协会理事会第十二次全会
  　关于戏剧电影的决议
    联共中央“关于剧院上演目录及其改进办法”的有历史意义的决议，对于苏维埃戏剧的发展，对于其思想水平与艺术水平的提高，已予以良好的影响。
    在联共中央的决议颁布后，全国的剧院里出现了一些剧本：这些剧本提出了现代性的重大问题，发掘了苏维埃社会在其走向共产主义运动中的生活现象，表明了苏维埃人民的劳动功勋和战斗功勋。
    应该归于这种戏剧作品的剧本如下：罗曼少夫的“伟大的力量”，西蒙诺夫的“俄罗斯问题”，契尔斯科夫的“胜利者”，维尔达的“我们的日粮”和“在一个国家中”，雅可布松的“堡垒生活”和“无战线的斗争”，索夫罗诺夫的“在一个城中”和“莫斯科的性格”，苏罗夫的“大命运”，柯尔涅楚克的“玛卡尔·杜布拉娃”，格利古里斯的“粘土与磁器”，毕尔文采夫的“南方的铁路连结站”，史坦茵的“荣誉之律”，莫夫松的“康斯坦丁·札斯罗诺夫”，柳必莫瓦雅的“小雪”，米哈尔科夫的“红领带”，德米特尔科的“瓦杜汀将军”，玛墨德杭拉的“东方之晨”，阿必舍夫的“统一的家庭”，布罗德勒的“河村之春”及若干其他剧本。
    但是全会在指出执行联共中央各项指示的这些初步的成绩时，仍认为当前的苏维埃戏剧界的情况还是不能令人满意的。苏维埃各剧院没有够量的有高度思想质量和艺术技巧的剧本。苏维埃戏剧的落后，成为苏维埃戏剧文化进一步高涨的障碍了。
    作家协会主席团及书记处没有动员作家去执行联共中央关于剧院上演目录的决议，没有吸引全国的优秀作家去从事写作剧本，没有领导创作戏剧作品的作家，而且也没有给予他们以创作上的帮助。
    尤其不可容许的是，近两年来走入戏剧界的青年作家，没有获得作家协会书记处及主席团的必要的帮助。
    由于苏维埃文学的这个重要部门落于作家协会书记处的视野之外的结果，全国剧院舞台上和刊物中，最近又出现了一些毫无思想的、非艺术的剧本。其中有些剧本（Ｎ·包高亭的“天鹅绒的季节”，Ｖ·索洛夫耶夫的“良心”）乃是对苏维埃生活之直接曲解和对苏维埃人们典型之歪曲；有些剧本（波利亚科夫的“未曾等待”，芬克的“大学生”，玛斯与契尔温斯基的“关于朋友同志”，加利奇和伊萨耶夫的“泰美尔半岛召唤着你”，乌斯宾斯基的“三个朋友”），因其思想水平与艺术水平的低下，无论怎样也不能符合苏联观众的提高了的需要。
    剧作家和剧院没有注意联共中央的一项指示，该指示说，在一九四五年—四六年上演的若干剧本中，苏维埃人们“是用畸形漫画的形式描绘的，原始而少文化，有庸俗的嗜好和习性；否定的人物则赋予以性格之更明显的特征，表现得有力量、有意志，而且很老练。这种剧本中的事件，往往是想象地虚构地描绘的，因此，这些剧本造成了关于苏维埃生活的不正确的、歪曲的印象”。
    同时，剧院舞台上却出现了西方资产阶级自由主义作家的剧本的译本，而这些翻译剧本对于苏联观众没有任何思想上和艺术上的价值。
    艺术委员会至今没有采取坚决的办法，使苏维埃剧作家的剧本由优秀的导演来导演，使第一流的演员来演现代主题的戏。
    全会指出了苏维埃剧作家在剧本中所提出的关于苏维埃社会生活的主题之不够多样性。表现苏维埃人们的劳动功勋的作品，是没有的。工人和集体农民，他们为完成战后五年计划和巩固苏维埃国家威力的斗争，在戏剧舞台上，描绘得十分不够。拥护科学中先进的苏维埃的唯物论观点（例如在生物学、医学等等方面）的胜利而反对现代西欧和美国资产阶级学者的敌对而落后的唯心论观点的思想斗争，在苏维埃剧作家的著作中没有得到其反映。对资产阶级西方谄媚行为的种种表现，还存在于落后的苏维埃知识分子阶层中；这些表现还只是在非常少数剧本中受到了揭露和嘲笑。与这种谄媚行为表现作斗争的主题，苏维埃爱国主义的教育，依旧是戏剧的主要主题之一。
    作家协会及其戏剧委员会，没有将掌握专门技巧、提高作品艺术水平定为剧作家的任务。在许多剧本中，作家在观察生活现象的时候，把这些现象定型化。而没有思想上和艺术上的深刻概括。剧本中往往也有提得很正确的主题，但主题的伟大思想在剧本主人翁的性格和个人命运上却没有应有体现。这一切所造成的结果是，这些剧本因其艺术水平不够高，不能使苏维埃观众感兴趣，很快地便从上演剧目中取消了。
    上述苏维埃戏剧的种种弱点之最重要的原因，依旧是作家及剧作家与工人、集体农民、知识分子对现代生活和劳动的联系不够。只有深刻地熟悉现代生活，熟悉胜利的新与旧的冲突中所产生的现实冲突，深刻地熟习我们的苏联读者，才能使苏维埃剧作走上社会主义艺术的康庄壮大道。
    全会特别地指出了戏剧批评的令人不满意的情况。“戏剧”杂志（主编为卡拉史尼科夫同志）及“苏联艺术”报（主编为夫多维琴科同志），常常给形式主义的、绅士派头的、为苏维埃艺术所陌生的批评提供自己的篇幅。
    全俄戏剧协会戏剧批评组和作家协会戏剧委员会中聚集了一些批评家，这些批评家是站在党所谴责了的艺术不参加政治生活的立场上，他们是以多少公开的或掩饰的形式坚持这种立场的。这种批评家（古尔维奇，尤索夫斯基，玛流金等等）在刊物上较少露骨地，而在全俄戏剧协会的种种会议上和在文学家中央大厦中则较多露骨地从形式主义的和唯美主义的立场上企图使苏维埃戏剧的积极的现象丧失信誉。凡表现我们现实的剧本之出现，和苏维埃人们在卫国战争战线上及在战后社会主义建设时期的英勇功勋，是被这些批评家所仇视的。他们尤其敌视走向戏剧界的文学青年。
    这种批评家企图动摇剧院对于现代苏维埃主题的信心，使苏联观众走上不正确的方向，妨碍面对现代主题的许多剧作家的创作才能的发展。在这种批评家中间，培养着对西方资产阶级文化的谄媚主义，蔑视着俄罗斯古典戏剧的最丰富的遗产，对于苏维埃时期的大量经验存在着虚无主义的态度。
    全会指出，在戏剧批评家中间，至今还存在着朋友的宗派的关系。这批评家在“苏维埃艺术”报及“戏剧”杂志上所撰写的文章中，并且在全俄戏剧协会和在作家协会会议上的发言中，“在其对剧本和演出的评价上，不是以苏维埃剧作与演剧艺术的思想发展和艺术发展的利益为指南，就是说，不是以国家的和人民的利益为指南，而是以宗派的、朋友的、个人的利益为指南”（联共中央关于剧院上演目录的决议）。
    有一部份苏维埃戏剧批评家（波尔夏果夫斯基，波雅德什也夫，瓦尔沙夫斯基）事实上是受形式主义的、唯美主义的批评的束缚的；另外一些批评家（阿尔特曼，霍洛朵夫）则对这种异己的剧本创作观与演剧艺术观采取调和态度。这样，站在不参加政治生活的立场上，站在“纯艺术”、“为艺术而艺术”的立场上的批评家们，其过去和现在的工作，至今还没有被揭露，没有受到批判。（未完）
