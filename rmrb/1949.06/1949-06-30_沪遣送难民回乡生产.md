Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, June 29th: In order to transform the city's surplus population into a productive force, the Shanghai Municipal People's Government is now actively mobilizing and sending refugees displaced by the war back to their hometowns for production. These refugees include farmers who fled due to rural bankruptcy, refugees from various places who fled during the war, family members of stranded puppet government and military personnel, and students who were deceived into coming to Shanghai. This large number of people has created an abnormal state of poverty and unemployment in Shanghai. In order to quickly send these people back to their hometowns for production, the People's Government has decided to universally issue refugee return permits, and those who cannot afford to return home will have their public transportation fares reduced or waived. The East China Military Region has also issued a circular to various places, urging them to actively prepare to resettle returnees to engage in production. The circular pointed out that for fleeing landlords who return to their hometowns, as long as they express to the peasants that they will no longer do evil, they should also be provided with production materials and living necessities. On the 23rd, the Political Takeover Committee of the Military Control Commission hosted representatives from various public welfare, charitable, and welfare organizations in Shanghai, calling on them to assist in this mobilization and repatriation work.

　　沪遣送难民回乡生产
    【新华社上海二十九日电】为使城市过剩人口变为生产力量，上海市人民政府现正着手动员与遣送战争中的难民回乡生产。这些难民中包括因农村破产而逃亡的农民，各地在战争中逃来的难民、流落的伪军政人员家属及被骗来沪之学生。这批人员数量极大，造成沪市贫困和失业者众多的不正常状态。为迅速遣送这些人员回乡生产，人民政府决定普遍发给难民回乡通行证，无力回乡者，减免其乘坐公营车船的票费。华东军区亦通令各地积极准备安置回乡者从事生产。通令中指出各地对于返乡的逃亡地主，只要向农民表明不再作恶，亦应予以生产资料与生活资料的照顾。二十三日，军管会政务接管委员会招待沪各公益、慈善、福利团体的代表，号召彼等协助此项动员遣送工作。
