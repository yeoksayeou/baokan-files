Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, 10th: On the morning of June 2nd, as the People's Liberation Army occupied Cangkou and was pursuing the fleeing Kuomintang bandit troops along the highway from Sifang to Liuting, a large banner reading "Welcome the People's Liberation Army" suddenly appeared in front of the gate of China Textile Company No. 1 Factory. The walls on both sides were covered with slogans welcoming the People's Liberation Army. Workers surged forward like a tide, waving red and green flags, erupting in cheers of "Long Live the People's Liberation Army!" and "Long Live Chairman Mao!" One worker excitedly said to the People's Liberation Army, "We've been secretly listening to the Xinhua Broadcasting Station for a long time, and we heard the sound of cannons, so everyone knew it was coming soon." Another worker said, "Comrades, rest assured, we have protected the factory well."

In the afternoon, as the neat ranks of the People's Liberation Army entered the city, five trucks drove up, carrying male and female workers from the Qingdao Telecommunications Bureau who had come to offer flowers to the PLA soldiers. Following this, students from Shandong University brought boiled water. The city streets were filled with welcoming crowds, who enthusiastically cheered and waved. The PLA vehicles could only proceed slowly. At this time, a group of workers from the Telecommunications Bureau appeared on the utility poles, repairing the lines damaged by the artillery fire. Street propaganda poems written by students from Shandong University also appeared on the walls of various streets. In front of a middle school hung a picture, depicting a PLA soldier with a smiling face closely surrounded by a group of students, with a quote from Mr. Lu Xun written beside it: "You have come, save the children!" The workers' protection team of the Qilu Company Rubber Factory used the code words "Clear Sky" that evening. Wang Yunsheng, an elderly worker over sixty years old from the power plant, said, "Qingdao has suffered the ravages and rule of imperialism from Germany, Japan, and the United States, and the Kuomintang, for fifty years. Today, we have finally arrived at the era of our own people."

　　我军进入青岛市区时
  　男女工人纷纷献花
    学生写道：你们来了，救救孩子！
    【新华社济南十日电】六月二月上午，当人民解放军占领了沧口，正在沿着四方至流亭的公路追击登船逃窜的国民党匪军时，突然，在中纺公司一厂大门前，出现了一面写着“欢迎人民解放军”的大旗，两旁墙上满是欢迎解放军的标语。工人象潮水一般的拥过来，挥动着红红绿绿的旗子，暴响起一片“解放军万岁！”“毛主席万岁！”的欢呼声。一位工人兴奋地对着解放军说：“俺早就偷听了新华广播电台的广播，又听到了炮声，谁都知道快了。”另一位工人说：“同志，你们放心，我们把工厂都保护好了。”
    下午，解放军的整齐行列进入市区时，迎面驶来了五辆卡车，这是青岛电讯局的男女工人赶来给解放军战士献花的。接着，山东大学的同学又送来了开水。市区马路上挤满了欢迎的行列，他们热烈地欢呼、挥手。解放军的汽车只得慢慢地前进着。这时，电线杆头出现了一批电讯局的工人，他们正在修复被炮火打坏的线路。山东大学学生写的街头宣传诗也在各街的墙上出现了。一所中学校的门前，挂着这样的一幅图书，一位满脸笑容的解放军战士被一群学生紧密地围着，旁边引着鲁迅先生的话写道：“你们来了，救救孩子！”齐鲁公司橡胶厂的工人护厂队，这天晚上的口令用了“晴天”两字。发电厂一位叫做王云盛的六十余岁老工人说：“青岛受尽了德、日、美等帝国主义和国民党的蹂躏统治，整整有五十年了，今天总算到了俺们人民自己的朝代了。”
