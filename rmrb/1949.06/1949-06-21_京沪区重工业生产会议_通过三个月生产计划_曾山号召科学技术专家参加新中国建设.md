Xinhua News Agency report: The Beijing-Shanghai Area Heavy Industry Production Conference was held in Shanghai on the 13th, lasting three days, and concluded on the 15th. The conference formulated a three-month heavy industry production plan for July, August, and September, which will be implemented after approval by the Shanghai Military Control Commission's Finance and Economics Takeover Committee. At the meeting, Deputy Mayor Zeng Shan called on science and technology experts to unite and participate in the heavy industry construction of New China. Deputy Mayor Zeng pointed out that without a strong heavy industrial base, it would be impossible to build a prosperous New China. The recovery and development of China's heavy industry have many favorable conditions. For example, the development of many production undertakings currently urgently needs to be resolved by developing heavy industry. The increased production of the Huainan Coal Mine requires power and machinery, railway transportation requires vehicles, shipping requires a large number of ships, and the production recovery and reconstruction of other regions also require heavy industry to manufacture a large number of machinery and equipment to be successful. To develop agricultural productivity, we must also rely on the development of heavy industry. For example, if we plan to be completely or mostly self-sufficient in cotton within three to five years, then a large number of cotton gins, presses, etc., will need to be manufactured by heavy industry factories. If agricultural mechanization is implemented, then it will be even more necessary to produce a large number of agricultural machines. Therefore, heavy industry's position in social production is extremely important, and its future is infinitely broad. Deputy Mayor Zeng pointed out that most of China's various scientific construction talents are concentrated in the Beijing-Shanghai area, which is a very valuable construction force. As long as this force unites and cooperates with all working people under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, it will be able to infinitely create social wealth and build a prosperous New China. Deputy Mayor Zeng called on science and technology experts to unite and strive for scientific experts outside the liberated areas to participate in the construction of New China. Finally, Deputy Mayor Zeng instructed military representatives and Communist Party members in various factories and mines not to be arrogant and conceited, but to be good at uniting various science and technology experts, humbly listen to their opinions, and not discriminate against or exclude non-Party science and technology workers.

    京沪区重工业生产会议
    通过三个月生产计划
    曾山号召科学技术专家参加新中国建设
    【本报讯】据新华社电：京沪区重工业生产会议十三日在沪举行，历时三日，已于十五日闭幕。会议制订了七、八、九三个月的重工业生产计划，待上海军管会财经接管委员会批准后即可实行。会上，曾山副市长号召科学技术专家团结一致参加新中国的重工业建设。曾副市长指出没有强大的重工业基础，要建设富强的新中国是不可能的。中国重工业的恢复与发展存在着许多有利条件，如目前许多生产事业的发展就都迫切需要从发展重工业来解决。淮南煤矿的增产需要动力与机器，铁路运输需要车辆，航运需要大批轮船，其他地区的生产恢复与重建，也都需要重工业去制出大量机器设备才能成功。为发展农业生产力，同样得依靠重工业的发展。如我们计划三五年内棉花能全部或大部自给，这样大量的弹花机、压力机等就需要重工业工厂去制造。如实行农业机械化，那就更需要大量生产农业机器。因此重工业在社会生产中的地位是极重要的，它的前途是无限广宽的。曾副市长指出中国各种科学建设人材大部集中在京沪一带，这是一支很可宝贵的建设力量。只要这一力量在中国共产党领导下与一切劳动人民团结合作，便能无限地创造社会财富，建设富强的新中国。曾副市长号召科学技术专家团结起来，并争取现在解放区外的科学专家一起来参加新中国的建设事业。最后，曾副市长指示各厂矿军事代表与共产党员不要骄傲自大，而要善于团结各种科学技术专家，虚心听取他们的意见，不应歧视与排斥党外的科学技术工作者。
