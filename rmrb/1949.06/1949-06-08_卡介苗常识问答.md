　　Common Sense Q&A on BCG Vaccine
　　Technician, Tianjin Anti-epidemic Station Chen Zhengren
　　1. What is BCG?
　　As early as 1907, two Frenchmen, A. Calmette and C. Guerin, used a strain of bovine tuberculosis bacillus grown on a potato culture medium containing bile. They discovered that its virulence gradually disappeared. Through their continuous research, it was inoculated every two or three weeks. After thirteen years of efforts, after more than 230 generations of inoculation, they published a paper in 1920 announcing that the pathogenicity of this bacterium had completely disappeared. A large number of animals such as guinea pigs, rabbits, cattle, and monkeys were injected with this bacterium, and none of them became ill. This bacterium is called Bacille Calmette Guerin, abbreviated as BCG, which is translated into Chinese as BCG.
　　2. What is the BCG vaccine?
　　Since Calmette discovered that animals injected with BCG not only did not become ill but also increased their body's resistance or immunity to tuberculosis bacilli, most animals did not become ill even if they were injected with more virulent tuberculosis bacilli. Even if a few become ill, the pathological changes are relatively minor. Therefore, it is believed that BCG can increase the immunity of animals to tuberculosis. The vaccine made from this bacterium is called BCG vaccine.
　　After the animal experiment was successful, Calmette believed that BCG could be made into an anti-tuberculosis vaccine for use in humans. Therefore, in 1921, he began to try it out in Paris, using oral administration to increase infants' resistance to tuberculosis, and the results were good. As such, it has gradually been promoted. Until now, millions of people around the world have received this vaccine, and its effectiveness is very significant. It has been recognized by the world's medical community as one of the effective methods of tuberculosis prevention. However, it can only be used for prevention, so it only has the effect of preventing disease, but not of treating it.
　　3. What is the principle of using BCG vaccine?
　　When bacteria enter the human body and come into contact with cells, if the number of invading bacteria is particularly large and has virulence, it is easy to cause people to get sick or even die. If the number of invading bacteria is not large and the body has some resistance, the invading bacteria can be surrounded and killed. If the body has undergone this special training, it will maintain a strong resistance to this type of bacteria. In other words, the body has considerable immunity to this type of bacteria. The use of BCG vaccine utilizes this principle. We cannot inject live and virulent tuberculosis bacilli into the human body, but we can use non-toxic BCG to make it come into contact with body cells and produce resistance to tuberculosis.
　　4. Is there any difference between BCG vaccine and other vaccines?
　　The principle of using BCG vaccine is the same as that of other vaccines, but the vaccines themselves are different. Commonly used vaccines such as cholera, typhoid, and pertussis vaccines contain bacteria that have been killed by chemicals or other methods, and their antigenicity can be maintained for a considerable period of time without change. However, BCG vaccine contains live bacteria, and its validity period is extremely short, about two weeks. If the period is extended, most of the bacteria will have died, and its antigenicity will be greatly reduced. Therefore, users should pay special attention to storing the vaccine in a cool and dark place, but it should not be frozen. It is best to keep it at about 2 to 10 degrees Celsius.
　　5. Are there any restrictions on the use of BCG vaccine?
　　The use of BCG vaccine is restricted. Not everyone can be vaccinated. Before use, a tuberculin test should be carried out, that is, to test whether a person has immunity to tuberculosis. If the test is positive, it indicates that the person has been in contact with tuberculosis bacilli, that is, the so-called natural infection. His body still maintains partial or considerable resistance to tuberculosis bacilli and does not need to be immunized again. If the tuberculin test is negative, it indicates that the person has not been in contact with tuberculosis bacilli, or even if they have been in contact, the resistance has gradually disappeared over time, and BCG vaccine can be used for immunization.
　　6. What is tuberculin?
　　In 1889, the German Koch cultured tuberculosis bacilli in a glycerol-containing broth culture medium and placed it in an incubator at 37 degrees Celsius. After two months of culture, it was taken out and heated to 100 degrees Celsius for about one hour, filtered with paper, and then the filtrate was slowly heated to evaporate the water to one-tenth of its original volume. This is tuberculin, (Tuberculin) the most important component of which is the tuberculous protein produced by tuberculosis bacilli.
　　Recently, some people have cultivated tuberculosis bacilli in a comprehensive culture medium and then precipitated the tuberculous protein with trichloroacetic acid or sulfuric acid, which is called purified protein derivative (Purified Protein Derivative), abbreviated as P.P.D., which contains fewer impurities than the old tuberculin.
　　The prepared tuberculin or purified protein derivative must be tested to measure the tuberculin unit it contains. One percent of the international standard tuberculin (one percent mg, O.T.) or one fifty-thousandth of the purified protein derivative (one fifty-thousandth mg. P.P.D.) is called one tuberculin unit (I.T.U.).
　　7. What is the tuberculin test?
　　The most commonly used tuberculin test is the Mantoux Test. The tuberculin is diluted so that the required units are contained in 0.1 cc. Then, this amount is injected intradermally. After 72 hours, the local reaction is observed to determine the positive or negative of the test. If the injection site hardens or becomes red and swollen with a diameter of 6 mm or more, it is called positive. If there is no hardening or swelling at the local site, it is negative. Occasionally, there is slight redness and swelling that does not meet the above standards, which is still negative. (To be continued)

　　卡介苗常识问答
    天坛防疫处技师  陈正仁
　　一、卡介菌是什么？
    远在一九○七年，有两位法国人，卡美氏（Ａ．Ｃａｌｍｅｔｔｅ）与介云氏（Ｃ　Ｇｕｅｒｉｎ）用一株牛型结核菌在含胆汁的马铃薯培养基上生长，发现其致病毒力渐渐消失，经他们不断的研究，每隔二三星期接种一次，经过十三年的努力，接种二百三十余代，到一九二○年他们发表论文，宣布此细菌的致病力全部消失，即以此种细菌大量注射各种动物，如海猪、家兔、牛及猴子等，均不能使它们得病，这种细菌称它为Ｂａｃｉｌｌｅ　Ｃａｌｍｅｔｔｅ　Ｇｕｅｒｉｎ简写为ＢＣＧ，在中文中译为卡介菌。
　　二、卡介菌苗是什么？
    自卡美氏发现凡经注射过卡介菌的动物，不但不发病，反而增加其身体对于结核菌的抵抗力或免疫力，若以较多而具毒力的结核菌注射之，大多数动物不致发病，即令有少数发病，其病理变化也较轻，故认为卡介菌能增加动物对结核病的免疫力，用这种细菌做成的苗菌即称卡介苗。
    自动物试验成功后，卡美氏认卡介菌可以制成防痨菌苗，使用于人类，故在一九二一年，即开始在巴黎试用，以口服方法来增加婴儿对于结核病的抵抗力，结果良好。如是渐渐推广，直到现在，全世界已有数百万人接受此种菌苗，功效甚著，其为有效防痨方法之一，已为世界医药界所公认，但是它只能用作预防之用，所以它只有防病之功，而无治病之力。
　　三、卡介菌苗使用之原理如何？
    当细菌进入到人身体，与体内细胞接触，如果侵入的细菌数目特别多，且具有毒力，则很容易使人患病，甚或至于死亡，若侵入的细菌不多，而身体稍有抵抗力，则可将侵入的细菌包围杀死，身体若经过此种特殊训练以后，对于此类细菌，保持强有力的抵抗力，换言之，身即体对此类细菌有相当的免疫力，卡介苗之使用，即利用此原理，我们不能将活而有毒力的结核菌注射入人身体内，但可将无毒的卡介菌来使它与身体细胞接触，而产生对结核病的抵抗力。
　　四、卡介苗与其他菌苗有无分别？
    卡介苗使用的原理和其他菌苗一样，但菌苗本身则不同，普通常用的菌苗如霍乱、伤寒、百日咳等菌苗，其中所含的细菌都经过化学药品或其他方法杀死，其抗原力可保持相当时期而不变。但卡介苗内含的是活菌，其有效期极短，约为两星期，如果时期延长则大部细菌多已死亡，其抗原力因之大减，故使用者极应注意，将菌苗藏于冷暗处，但又不宜于冻冰，最好是保持在摄氏二度至十度左右较为合宜。
　　五、卡介苗之使用，有无限制？
    卡介苗的使用，是有限制的，并不是人人都可接种的，在未使用之先，应举行结核素试验，即测验一个人对于结核病有无免疫力，若果该试验呈阳性反应，即表示这人已与结核菌接触过，即所谓自然感染者，他的身体对于结核菌尚保持有部份或相当的抵抗力，不用再行免疫，设若结核素试验呈阴性，即表示这人尚未与结核菌接触过，即或已经接触过，而以时日过久，其抵抗力已渐次消失，可用卡介苗作免疫接种。
　　六、何谓结核素？
    一八八九年德人郭霍氏（Ｋｏｃｈ）将结核菌种于含甘油之肉汤培养基内，置于摄氏卅七度之孵卵箱内，经过两个月的培养，取出加热至摄氏一百度约一小时，用纸过虑，再将虑液徐徐加热，使水分蒸发至原来容量的十分之一为止，此即为结核素，（Ｔｕｂｅｒｃｕｌｎ）其中最主要的成份，为由结核菌所产生的结核蛋白质。
    近来有人以综合培养基培育结核菌，再以三氯醋酸或硫酸＠沉淀，其中的结核蛋白质，称为纯蛋白衍化物。（Ｐｕｒｉｆｉｅｄ　Ｐｒｏｔｅｉｕ　Ｄｅｉｖａｔｌｖｅ）简写即为Ｐ，Ｐ，Ｄ，其中所含杂质，较旧结核素为少。
    制成的结核素或纯蛋白衍化物必须经过检定，测知其中所含的结核单位（Ｔｕｂｅｒｃｕｌｉｎ　Ｕｎｉｔ），凡含百分之一的国际标准结核素（百分之一ｍｇ，Ｏ，Ｔ，）或五万分之一的纯蛋白衍化物（五万分之一ｍｇ．Ｐ，Ｐ，Ｄ，）均称为一个结核单位（Ｉ，Ｔ，Ｕ）。
　　七、何谓结核素试验？
    最常用的结核素试验为满屠氏试验法（Ｍａｎｔｏｕｘ　Ｔｅｓｔ），将结核素稀释使所需要的单位包含在零点一公撮内，然后将此量作皮内注射，经七十二小时后，观察局部反应，以决定该试验的正负，如注射点发硬或红肿其直径在六＠（ｍｍ）或六＠以上者称为阳性，如局部无硬肿等现象即为阴性，间或有些微红肿而不能适合上述的标准者仍为阴性。（未完）
