[Reported by this Newspaper] The first flood prevention meeting in the North China Liberated Area, under the auspices of the North China Water Conservancy Commission, opened in Ping (Beiping) on June 16th. Attendees included representatives from the five districts of Ji-Lu-Yu, Ji-Nan, Ji-Zhong, Ji-Dong, and Chahar, as well as representatives from the North China Water Conservancy Engineering Bureau, the Tianjin Municipal People's Government Public Works Bureau, the Yongding River Guanting Reservoir Engineering Office, the Beiping Municipal People's Government Construction Bureau, and the Ministry of Agriculture, totaling more than twenty people. Song Shaowen, Secretary-General of the North China People's Government Finance and Economics Committee, also attended to provide guidance.

The meeting began with an opening address by Comrade Hao Zhizhai, a member of the North China Water Conservancy Commission. He said: Flood prevention is a major event in North China. This year, due to the complete liberation of North China, many favorable conditions have been added for flood prevention and river management, such as the unified management of various rivers, consideration for both upstream and downstream areas, and an increase in technical personnel. Therefore, we must overcome the guerrilla-style approach of past river management and flood prevention work and gradually move towards regularization. This is a major transformation under the new situation. Comrade Hao Zhizhai then explained that the purpose of this meeting was to introduce the progress of spring construction in various districts, exchange experiences in flood prevention deployment, and jointly solve some major problems in flood prevention and river management. He hoped that everyone could fight the floods with the same spirit as the People's Liberation Army, take advantage of favorable conditions, and do a good job in flood prevention so that North China would not be flooded this year, or at least be flooded less.

Secretary-General Song then spoke, pointing out that for the past twelve years, due to the repeated destruction of river embankments by Japanese imperialism and the Kuomintang reactionaries in an attempt to flood our liberated areas, our water conservancy workers, local cadres, and the broad masses had carried out heroic struggles, smashed the enemy's conspiracies, and achieved considerable success in flood prevention and river management. Today, with the complete liberation of the entire North China region, in order to ensure the sound development of industry and commerce and increase agricultural production, we must do a good job in this year's flood prevention work. He hoped that our water conservancy personnel could all become Yu the Great, shoulder this arduous task with a spirit of serving the people, and strive to avoid major floods this year. He further pointed out that flood prevention and river management are the urgent demands of the broad masses of the people. Experience has proved that relying on the millions of masses is the fundamental factor in our ability to win battles in river management. Today, with everything waiting to be rebuilt, but based on the current financial situation, we must take into account necessity and possibility, prioritize tasks according to their importance and urgency, and first carry out projects that cost little and yield great results. The principle of repairing dangerous areas and consolidating existing works adopted in this year's river management work is proposed in this spirit. Finally, he emphasized that flood prevention must rely on the masses, strengthen inspection work, and take precautions in advance to minimize the possibility of accidents. He also called for opposing bureaucratic work styles.

After Comrade Song Shaowen finished speaking, Xu Zheng, Deputy Director of the North China Water Conservancy Commission, cited flood cycle data and called on everyone to be highly vigilant in this year's flood prevention work. Subsequently, Sun Runfu and Yang Liming, advisors to the North China Water Conservancy Commission, Gao Jingying, Chief Engineer of the North China Water Conservancy Engineering Bureau, and Zhang Ren, advisor to the Guanting Reservoir Engineering Office, spoke one after another, unanimously agreeing that the People's Government spends a huge amount of money every year to carry out flood prevention and river management, demonstrating the government's care for the people. Advisor Sun Runfu said: "Such a thing could not be seen in the past."

At this point, the meeting began with representatives from various districts reporting on the construction progress and flood prevention arrangements in their respective districts. After the reports from various districts, discussions and summaries will be conducted. The meeting is expected to last five or six days.
