　　Jinnan Administrative Office Issues Instructions
  　Organize Wheat Seed Selection
    [Our Newspaper] The Jinnan Administrative Office issued instructions to all special districts, counties and farms regarding the organization of summer harvest seed selection. The main points are as follows:
    1. Advocate the method of selecting seeds locally and promoting them locally: Many places have experienced reduced production due to mixed seeds. This year, the removal of miscellaneous ears and selection of pure seeds should be advocated. In a district or village, if a better wheat variety is discovered, it should be selected and harvested. 2. Pay attention to selecting wheat varieties with strong resistance: This year, many areas have encountered three types of disasters: drought, insects, and disease, which provides an opportunity to select wheat varieties with strong resistance. Each farm should send technical cadres to the disaster-stricken wheat fields to collect samples for testing and observation. 3. Select and collect "Yulinbai" and "Guangzongbai" wheat varieties. 4. Each county and district should select one or two villages with relatively good production conditions among the masses, organize wheat ear competitions, and exchange seeds. Exchange conditions should be freely determined, but do not let the farming households suffer losses. Furthermore, organize a seed selection committee to select the best wheat fields in the entire village, designate them as seed selection areas, and carry out organized seed exchange. 5. Select and collect seeds of famine-relief crops. 6. Finely select high-quality wheat varieties: The wheat fields of each farm should be finely selected for superior seeds, preparing to allocate them to various places in a planned manner this autumn. 7. Conduct a survey of excellent varieties. Finally, each county should convene a district cadre meeting before wheat harvesting to convey and discuss wheat harvesting and seed selection methods; then convene village cadre and experienced farmer meetings to make seed selection a mass movement.

　　冀南行署发指示
  　组织选麦种
    【本报讯】冀南行政公署为组织夏收选种给各专县及农场发出指示，要点如下：
    一、提倡就地选种、就地推广的办法：不少地方因种子混杂而减产，今年应提倡去杂穗，选纯种。在一个区或一个村里，发现一个较好的麦种，就应把它选收起来。二、注意选择抵抗力强的麦种：今年不少地区小麦遇到旱、虫、病三种灾害，给了选抵抗力强的麦种一个机会。各农场应派技术干部到受灾的麦田里去采集，以便进行试验观察。三、选收“鱼鳞白”、“广宗白”麦种。四、各县区要选择一两个群众生产条件较好的村，组织麦穗赛会，进行换种。换种条件自由规定，但不要叫种地户吃亏。再就是组织选种委员会，选择全村最好的麦地，划为选种地，进行有组织的换种。五、选收备荒作物种子。六、精选优良麦种：各农场麦田，应进行精选优种，准备今秋有计划的分配各地。七、进行优良品种调查。最后各县于割麦前应召开区干会议，传达讨论麦收选种办法；然后召开村干和老农会议，使选种成为群众性的运动。
