　　Xinhua News Agency, Beiping, 13th: According to the U.S. Information Service, U.S. President Truman delivered a foreign policy speech in Little Rock, Kansas on the 11th, announcing the strengthening and implementation of an aggressive foreign policy. In his speech, Truman insisted on completely abolishing "special tariff barriers," which means demanding that Britain completely abandon the imperial preference system and the tariff barriers of other countries, so that the United States can dump its surplus goods into these countries, their colonies and dependencies. In order to use American taxpayers' money to further implement political and economic aggression against the Marshall Plan countries, Truman strongly opposed reducing the appropriation for the second year of the "Marshall Plan" in his speech, attacking it as "the worst kind of hypocritical economizing." Truman's speech reiterated his plan to expand aggression against the world, and he proposed to implement the so-called "plan for developing backward areas" that he put forward in his message to Congress in January. He himself seemed to feel that the aggressive nature of this plan was too blatant, so he deliberately concealed it, saying: "This is not an imperialist plan." In his speech, Truman also asked Congress to quickly approve the North Atlantic Aggression Treaty, and announced that he would submit a military aid bill to Congress in order to further control the signatory countries militarily and prepare for a new war.
    In his speech, Truman admitted: "Some people are already tired of the efforts we have made," "Some also advocate rejecting the various 'defensive' measures necessary to 'prevent' aggression, and some want to abandon our efforts to 'restore' world trade." But Truman said, "We must not shrink back now," "We must not give up halfway."

　　杜鲁门发表外交演说
  　叫嚣扩大对外侵略
  　首先要英国大开门以便入侵
    【新华社北平十三日电】据美国新闻处讯：十一日，美总统杜鲁门在堪萨斯州小石城发表外交演说，宣布要加强推行对外的侵略政策。杜鲁门在演说中坚主全部撤消“特殊的关税障碍”，也就是要求英国彻底放弃帝国特惠制以及其他各国的关税壁垒，好让美国过剩的商品向这些国家本土及其殖民地和附属国实行倾销。杜鲁门为了能利用美国纳税人的金钱，去进一步实行对马歇尔化各国的政治经济侵略，他在演说中极力反对削减“马歇尔计划”第二年的拨款，攻击之为“最恶劣的虚伪的节省办法”。杜鲁门演说重申其扩大对世界的侵略计划，他提出要执行他在一月间致国会咨文中所提出的所谓“开发落后地区的计划”。他自己似乎也觉得这个计划的侵略性质过于露骨，因此特意掩饰说：“这不是一个帝国主义的计划。”杜鲁门在演说中还要求国会迅速批准北大西洋侵略公约，并宣布将向国会提出军事援助法案，以便进一步在军事上控制缔约各国及进行新战争准备。
    杜鲁门在演说中承认：“有些人对于我们所作的努力已经感到厌倦”，“也有人主张拒绝对于‘防止’侵略所必要的种种‘防御’措施，也有人想放弃我们‘恢复’世界贸易的努力”。但是杜鲁门说：“我们现在决不能畏缩不前”，“决不能半途而废”。
