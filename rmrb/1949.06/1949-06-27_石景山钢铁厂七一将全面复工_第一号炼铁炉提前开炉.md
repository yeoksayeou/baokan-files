　　Shijingshan Steel Plant

　　To Fully Resume Production by July 1
　　No. 1 Blast Furnace Opens Ahead of Schedule
　　[Our Newspaper] The Shijingshan Steel Plant will fully resume production by July 1. Currently, only the No. 1 branch factory of the foundry is not yet operational. It is recently learned that the Ministry of Railways has ordered more than 5,000 tons of cast iron pipes from the steel plant. The foundry is currently busy preparing materials and will start casting pipes by July 1. At that time, the entire plant will hold a grand celebration to mark the full resumption of production and a solemn iron tapping ceremony.

　　[Our Newspaper] The No. 1, 250-ton blast furnace of the Shijingshan Steel Plant was ignited ahead of schedule at 10:20 PM on the 24th. The process went exceptionally well: no obstacles occurred in any part of the furnace or in the blower, boiler, hot blast stove, or other components. This has never happened during the enemy puppet period or the Chiang Kai-shek occupation period. The ignition ceremony began with the sound of gongs and drums. Comrade Xu Chi, Director of the Engineering Department of the North China People's Government Enterprise Department, Comrade Zhang Fang, military representative, and Mr. Chen Dashou, manager of North China Steel Company, all attended. The Beiping Film Studio specially filmed it.
　　The No. 1, 250-ton blast furnace of the Shijingshan Steel Plant is the largest of all the blast furnaces in North China that have resumed production. The furnace was originally built by American engineers hired by the Anfu clique warlords during World War I. Soon after the war ended, the price of iron plummeted, and the project was halted after only 80% completion. After the Japanese invaders occupied it, they actively repaired it to support their war of aggression, and it was officially put into operation on November 20, 1938. After the Nationalist Resources Committee took over, it only barely managed to start it up on April 1 of last year. When the Beiping Campaign began, it was declared closed again. After the liberation of Shijingshan, our takeover personnel immediately convened a meeting of all factory employees to discuss ways to rescue the furnace (because the furnace must have its firebricks replaced if it is stopped, resulting in great losses), and mobilized workers to collect raw materials such as ore and limestone in the factory, digging up more than 2,000 tons, saving the furnace once. Later, because the furnace temperature gradually decreased, and it was estimated that rescue was hopeless, it was decided to shut down the furnace for repairs in mid-February. The workers gave full play to their enthusiasm and creativity to repair the furnace, and fought against various difficulties. For example, the tens of thousands of large and small refractory bricks used for masonry were ground from the broken bricks left over from the past. Many workers even wore out their palms. According to an engineer: "In the past, doing such a project, even with a fully normal supply of materials and tools, would take half a year to complete."

　　石景山钢铁厂
  　七一将全面复工
  　第一号炼铁炉提前开炉
    【本报讯】石景山钢铁厂将于“七一”全面恢复生产，目前只有铸造厂一分工厂尚未开工。近闻铁道部已向钢铁厂订购五千余吨铸铁水管，现铸造厂正忙于准备材料，“七一”即可开工铸管，届时全厂将举行盛大的庆祝全面恢复生产大会，并举行隆重的出铁典礼。

    【本报讯】石景山钢铁厂第一号二百五十吨炼铁炉于二十四日下午十时二十分提前开炉升火。经过情形空前良好：炉子各部门及送风机、锅炉、热风炉等机件没有发生任何障碍，这是敌伪时期和蒋匪占领时期从来没有过的。升火典礼在锣鼓喧天中开始，华北人民政府企业部工程处处长徐驰同志，军事代表张方同志和华北钢铁公司经理陈大受先生均往参加，北平电影制片厂特为此摄制影片。
    按石景山钢铁厂第一号二百五十吨炼铁炉为全华北所有已恢复生产的炼铁炉中之最大者。该炉原为安福系军阀聘请美国工程师于第一次大战期间所建造，不久大战结束，铁价大跌，工程只完成百分之八十即行停顿。日寇占领后即积极修建，用以支持其侵略战争，于民国二十七年十一月二十日正式开炉。国民党资源委员会于劫收后，直到去年四月一日才勉强开炉。北平战役开始，便又宣告封炉。石景山解放后，我接管人员立刻召集全厂职工商议抢救该炉办法（因炉子一停即须拆换火砖，损失甚大），并发动工人在厂内收集矿石、石灰石等原料，共挖得二千余吨，救炉一次。后因炉温日渐下降，估计抢救无望，遂于二月中决定停炉修理。工友们为修好该炉发挥了最大的积极性与创造性，与各种困难作斗争。例如砌炉用的万余块大小耐火砖，便是用过去检剩下来的坏砖磨成的，许多工友们甚至磨破了自己的手掌。据一个工程师说：“过去做这样的工程，即使在材料工具供应十分正常的情形下，也得半年才能完工”。
