Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, May 31st: Under the command of war criminal Gui Yongqing, the commander of the puppet navy, the Kuomintang bandit troops in Shanghai destroyed the largest Jiangnan Shipyard in the country. According to preliminary investigations, more than two-thirds of the sluice gate pumps in the three large docks of the factory, which are famous in the Far East, were destroyed. All three tugboats attached to the sluice gate were blown up. The main equipment of the entire facility, the internal combustion welding factory, the entire building of the new power plant, the paint factory, and four diesel generators, were all destroyed. The crane equipment in the machine shop, the outer pliers section of the repair shop, the forging department, the lead factory, and the carpentry factory were severely damaged. Other offices, dormitories, hull factories, welding departments, and other places were all looted and destroyed by the bandit troops. All the factory's trucks, jeeps, and telephones were stolen. When reporters visited, they personally saw twenty boxes of Japanese army demolition explosives that had not yet been detonated in the factory. The words "Made in Showa 18" were clearly visible on the boxes. The Kuomintang bandit gang originally attempted to dismantle and move the factory to Taiwan, but were prevented by the heroic struggle of the workers. The Jiangnan Shipyard was founded in 1862 and was originally called the Jiangnan Manufacturing Bureau. In the 31st year of the reign of Emperor Guangxu of the Qing Dynasty, it was divided into two parts: one was the Jiangnan Shipyard, under the jurisdiction of the Navy, and the other was the Arsenal, under the jurisdiction of the Army. During the Japanese occupation, the two parts were merged into one, collectively known as the Jiangnan Shipyard. During the First World War, the Allied Powers built four 12,000-ton transport ships here. From the 31st year of the reign of Emperor Guangxu of the Qing Dynasty to the present, more than 1,600 ships and vessels have been built. The factory had a maximum of more than 8,000 employees, and currently has nearly 4,000.

Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, May 31st: When the fleeing enemy in Ningbo fled to Dinghai and Zhoushan, they robbed many civilian ships of all sizes, which caused some difficulties in the resumption of transportation and caused more than 1,000 dock workers to lose their jobs. According to preliminary investigations, the stolen ships include Dahua, Dada, Chuanshan, and other thirteen ships. In addition, the whereabouts of Jiangsu, Haisheng, and Huazhong and other four ships are unknown. There are only four ships left in Ningbo Port that can sail. However, many small tugboats were spared from being robbed by hiding in time. Among them, ten small inland river tugboats returned to Ningbo on the third day after the liberation of Ningbo.

　　战犯桂永清罪恶滔天
  　严重破坏江南造船所
    【新华社上海三十一日电】在伪海军总司令战犯桂匪永清的指挥下上海国民党匪军破坏了全国规模最大的江南造船所。据初步调查，该厂在远东著名的三个大船坞的水闸抽水机，被炸毁三分之二以上。系在水闸上的三只拖轮均被炸毁。全所的主要设备内燃焊厂、新发电厂全部厂房、油漆厂及四部柴油发电机，全遭毁坏。机器厂起重设备，修械所外钳间、锻工部、铅工厂、木工厂等损毁甚重。其他办公室、宿舍、船体厂、电焊部等处，均为匪军大肆劫掠破坏。全所卡车、吉普车、电话机等被盗一空。记者前往时，亲见所内尚有未及爆炸的日本陆军用爆破炸药二十箱，箱上昭和十八年造等字样清晰可见。国民党匪帮原企图将该厂拆卸迁移台湾，但被工人的英勇斗争所阻止。按江南造船所创建于一八六二年，原称江南制造局。清光绪三十一年时，分为两部：一为江南造船所，属海军管辖；一为兵工厂，属陆军管辖。日寇侵占时，两部又合并为一，统称江南造船所。第一次世界大战时，协约国曾在此建造一万二千吨的运输舰四艘。自清光绪三十一年至今，曾修建船只舰艇一千六百余艘。该所职工最多时共八千余人，现有近四千人。
    【新华社上海三十一日电】宁波逃敌在逃往定海、舟山时，抢走民用大小轮船多艘，因而使交通恢复发生若干困难，并使一千多码头工人失业。据初步调查，被抢走之轮船有大华号、大达号、穿山号等十三艘，另有江苏、海盛、华众等四艘下落不明。现在宁波港口可以航海的轮船尚剩四艘。但许多小火轮因及时躲藏起来免于被劫，其中有十艘内河小轮已于宁波解放后第三日，开回宁波。
