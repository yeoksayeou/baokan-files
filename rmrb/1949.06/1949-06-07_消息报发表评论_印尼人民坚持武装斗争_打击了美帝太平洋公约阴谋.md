Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, June 5th: Moscow dispatch: Izvestia recently published an essay by Bahomov commenting on the Indonesian situation, stating that the "agreement" obtained in Batavia by the Dutch government and the Hatta "government" is merely a contrived political conspiracy. The negotiations between the Dutch colonialists and the Hatta "government" first prove the failure of the Dutch armed invasion of Indonesia, an invasion supported and encouraged by US and British expansionists. From April 1948 to March 1949, the Dutch colonialists obtained more than $402 million from the United States for their colonial adventures in Indonesia. However, the US-Dutch reactionaries completely miscalculated. They did not expect that the rapid occupation of Yogyakarta by Dutch paratroopers and the surrender of the Hatta "government" would by no means equal the surrender of Indonesia and the Indonesian people. The Indonesian people have not laid down their weapons. Fighting for the Republic has become the main slogan of the Indonesian people's national liberation movement. The need for American expansionists to feign a political solution to the Indonesian problem is primarily to remove obstacles to the conclusion of the so-called Pacific Pact. Similar to the North Atlantic Treaty, one of the main purposes of this pact is to attempt to use the bourgeois nationalist groups of Asian countries to oppose the national liberation movements of the colonial and dependent peoples. The US-British bloc forced the UN General Assembly to decide to postpone consideration of the Indonesian issue until the Fourth Assembly, in order to drag the Indonesian issue until the puppet United States of Indonesia under their control could be manufactured. There is no need to prove that this policy is in extreme violation of the UN Charter and the urgent demands for peace.

    【新华社北平五日电】莫斯科讯：消息报顷发表巴霍莫夫评论印尼情势的论文称：荷兰政府与哈达“政府”在巴达维亚所获得的“协议”，只是一种授意的政治阴谋。荷兰殖民者与哈达“政府”间的谈判，首先证明荷兰武装进攻印尼的失败，这种进攻是受到美英扩张主义者的支持和鼓励的。荷兰殖民者为了在印尼进行殖民冒险，自一九四八年四月至一九四九年三月，曾自美国获得四亿零二百余万美元。但是，美荷反动派完全估计错了，他们没有料到：荷兰伞兵的迅速占领日惹与哈达“政府”的投降，绝不等于印尼与印尼人民的投降，印尼人民并未放下武器。为共和国而战已成为印尼人民民族解放运动的主要口号。美国扩张主义者之须要玩弄印尼问题政治解决的外貌，首先是为了去掉缔结所谓太平洋公约的障碍，与北大西洋公约相似的这个公约的主要目的之一，是企图利用亚洲各国的资产阶级民族主义集团来反对殖民地与附属国人民的民族解放运动。美英集团迫使联合国大会决定延期考虑印尼问题，直到第四届大会，就是为了把印尼问题拖到它们所主持的傀儡印尼合众国可以制成的时候。无须证明，这种政策是极端违反联合国宪章及争取和平的迫切要求的。
