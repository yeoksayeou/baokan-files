　　Rebuilding the Huai River Bridge
　　Political Department of the Third Detachment of the Railway Column

　　The Huai River Bridge construction project has entered a tense stage. In the 800-meter radius work area on both sides of the Huai River iron bridge, the air is filled with labor songs, shouts, and the urgent calls and responses of commanders—a symphony only the accustomed can decipher. Two 75-horsepower power generators are stationed on the old bridge, their motors humming evenly day and night, continuously for over forty days. This motor sound provides power to the entire site. Listen to the steady sawing of wood from the electric saw and the intermittent high-pitched sound of the electric planer under a new wooden house to the lower left. More than 2,000 cubic meters of lumber are being produced there, emitting the strong scent of pine, wood grown in the forests of the Xing'an and Changbai Mountains. Tractors are roaring effortlessly, dragging the processed lumber to the riverbank on the right, where the sound of axes chopping wood fills the air, indistinguishable as to whose axe is at work. Within this sound, wooden boxes rise layer by layer, and wooden frames are assembled one by one. If you listen closely, the faint whirring of electric drills can be heard interspersed. On the pile-driving ship in the heart of the river, the heavy hammering of the internal combustion pile driver mixes with the sound of gas explosions, like a grand drum in a military band, beating out a magnificent rhythm. A row of flatcars rolls rumblingly on the tracks, and the steam crane occasionally sounds its whistle as a signal to start. Coincidentally, a train carrying lumber arrives at the bridgehead, and its full-bodied whistle blows a long blast, representing the enthusiastic support of the laboring brothers in the rear. The broadcasting machine plays "The Song of Merit" from loudspeakers suspended high in several places, reporting the heroic deeds of various units. In this great symphony, the sound of the Huai River's waves becomes the whimper of the conquered, no longer heeded.

　　Looking from a high vantage point, another magnificent picture of a labor army engaged in battle unfolds. The masts and sails in the distant upstream and downstream areas indicate the importance and prosperity of this midstream port on the Huai River. Four bridges, closely juxtaposed, span the Huai River. The one furthest downstream is the original iron bridge, which was destroyed on January 15th of this year by the bandit Chiang Kai-shek, who ordered his henchman Liu Ruming's troops to use eighty tons of explosives, vainly attempting to prevent the advance of the People's Liberation Army and delay the fate of the small court in Jiangnan. This bridge lies there like a giant chain of hatred. Today, it serves only one purpose: everyone who sees it remembers the Kuomintang's brutal rule. Thus, every soldier will be filled with hatred, accelerating our pace forward, accelerating the construction of new bridges and a new people's nation. Fifteen meters—at a 45-degree angle—from this chain of hatred, a new bridge is being built. In the thirty-three days since formal work began, wooden bridge piers have sprung up like bamboo shoots after a spring rain. Of the sixteen piers and two abutments, the 498-meter-long bridge has now completed fourteen. In the center of the river, the caissons for the remaining two piers are being installed. Only a 75-meter stretch of turbulent rapids is left, but the project leaders say that the final two caissons, numbers seven and eight, can be installed in six days. The same difficult work has already been completed for four piers, and with the experience gained, there is even more confidence in installing these two. After that, it will be a matter of erecting the steel beams and laying the rails. The bridge-laying machine has already been assembled at the northern end of the bridge, waiting to complete the final touch. We can see that this new bridge is growing everywhere. On pier number six, a crane is lifting wooden frames and placing them upwards. This crane has a history. It is a product of the Guangxu era, originally an old-fashioned dredger used to dredge the Huai River waterway. The steam engine is rusting, and the lifting device is not a toothed wheel and compound pulley, but a friction wheel and single pulley. After it was found, it was repaired and could only lift two tons. After the engineer's design, mechanical technician Hu Junfeng, mechanical platoon deputy platoon leader Wang Jichen, and comrades from the technical company studied and改造 (gaizao - transform/remodel), adding a long crane arm and compound pulley. It can now easily lift wooden frames weighing about ten tons, playing a significant role. This old ship never imagined that it would participate in the construction of the new China today. The seventh caisson—a huge object twelve meters long, six meters wide, and seven meters high—is now half-floating in the water, striking in the middle of the giant pile-driving ship, steadily moving towards its position.

　　The pile-driving ship is composed of two sixty-ton iron barges, on which three pile drivers, each twelve meters high, are erected. It looks like a three-masted ocean-going ship. The comrades here have given it a glorious name, calling it the "Cruiser." Now the "sailors" on our "Cruiser" are turning the winches at the four corners, adjusting the direction of the ship, and fighting the rapids. At distant pier number nine, pile driving was completed last night, appearing as four rows of teeth (ten in each row) growing out of the water. A group of carpenters is working on this tooth island—sawing the pile heads flat and installing the saddles. From pier number ten to the south bank is a dragon of people, busily carrying stones and throwing them into the caissons, stirring up splashes of water. The soldiers say they are "firing cannons." The eleventh wooden frame has already been assembled, and a theodolite has been set up on it. The surveyor is waving the red flag in his hand—giving flag signals.

　　Steamships are towing wooden piles on the river. In the heart of the river, one hundred meters upstream, a flatboat is moored, with four winches on it. It is fixed to a large steel cable across the river. Although it is far from the bridge and goes unnoticed, it bears a crucial task. It can move left and right, enabling the "Cruiser" and the caisson it carries to move up, down, left, and right, to the exact position we need.

　　Near pier number ten, there are also two boats moored, with a small house on them. There is a railing at the door, and diving equipment and clothing are installed on it. People regularly dive into the water to work. These underwater heroes include soldiers and diving workers from Rongcheng County, Shandong. They are answering and solving the secrets hidden in the turbulent eight- or nine-meter-deep waters of the Huai River—whether it is mud or stone, whether the foundation is flat or inclined. They also have to tie stones underwater, feel for steel cables, and level the foundation.

　　In the distant river beach, rows of tents are now empty. Racks of guns are erected on the flat ground in front of the tents, and one or two sentries are guarding them. On top of some of the tents, red flags proudly flutter, with the words "Exceeding the Task" or "Completing the Task" written in white. That is where the troops rest. Nearby, green smoke rises as the cooks are boiling water and preparing meals.

　　Large banners made by the propaganda team are powerfully written on both sides of the work site, bearing slogans such as "Conquer the Huai River Floods, Complete the Task Ahead of Schedule" and "Improve Technology, Save Materials, Cherish Tools."

　　Connecting both sides of the work site is a pontoon bridge composed of sixty civilian boats, like a centipede lying there. It continuously transports the materials needed everywhere. This is almost the panoramic view of this great construction picture.

　　Not far upstream is another pontoon bridge that is currently open to traffic. The bridge is very crowded. Sometimes thousands of pushcarts constantly push grain and materials across the bridge to the south. When a heavy-duty truck carrying ammunition crosses the bridge, all the boatmen climb out of the cabins, watching the boats and the trucks tremulously, and slowly crawl past, fearing that danger might occur. Seeing how difficult the transportation is now, it further illustrates the great significance of the railway bridge that is about to be built.

　　Here, a huge amount of labor, modern engineering technology, and the strong organizational discipline and political work of the People's Army are combined.

　　The materials used, roughly estimated: more than 120 tons of steel, 10,000 x 1,000 roots of lumber, 15,000 cubic meters of stone.... The machinery used includes the world's most advanced internal combustion pile driver and China's only double-arm bridge-laying machine. This bridge-laying machine was invented by a Soviet engineer during the Soviet-German War and won a Second Class Stalin Prize. It is currently being used after being仿造 (fangzao - imitated/copied) by workers at the Northeast Thirty-Sixth Steel Factory. Technically, due to the complex geology of the Huai River, the north bank is a silty bottom, the south bank is rock, and the water depth in the center is more than eight meters. The round-the-clock work and full work enthusiasm are fully demonstrated by carrying out the merit campaign and promoting engineering democracy, which embodies the fine traditions of our party and our army—applying the style of combat to engineering construction.

　　In response to the call of Ministers Teng and Lü of the Ministry of Railways, "Three Months' Task, Complete in Two Months," this slogan seems to have a realistic basis. From their current daily work plans, it seems that they are not satisfied and are pursuing better results to respond to the call of higher authorities, military requirements, and the hopes of the people, preparing to complete it before July 1st as a gift to the Party's birthday!

　　重建淮河大桥
    铁道纵队第三支队政治部
    淮河大桥的修建工程已进入紧张阶段，在淮河铁桥两岸八百米方圆的工作场地，到处洋溢着劳动的歌声、呼号声，指挥者的紧张的呼唤和应答，这种人声只有习惯的人才听得清楚。两台七十五马力的发电车，停在旧桥上；均匀的日以继夜地马达声，不间断地轰响了四十几天了。从这马达声中供给全部现场的动力，你听在他下左方一个新的木房下面匀整的响着电锯的锯木声，和间隙的电刨声的高音，制造两千多立米木材。在那里散发着浓重的松木香味，那是兴安岭上长白山中生长出来的树木。有拖拉机轻松的吼叫着，拖着制成的木材走向右侧的河边，那里响起一片斧头砍木的声音，分不清是谁的斧子在响。这响声中木箱一层层的长起来，木架一个个做起来，假如走近细细的辨别，这里面还夹杂着电钻的细歌嘤嘤。在河心的打桩船上内燃打桩机，沉重的锤击声和瓦斯爆发的声音混合，象军乐队中的大鼓，打着雄壮的拍子；一排小平车在轨道上轰轰滚动，蒸气刁船不时响几声汽笛，作为开动的警号。碰巧运送木材的列车开到桥头，饱满的汽笛长鸣，代表后方劳动弟兄支援工作热情的呼唤。广播机在几处高悬的喇叭筒里唱着“立功歌”，报告着各个单位的英雄事迹。在这巨大的交响乐中，淮河的浪涛声，成为被征服者的呜咽，已没有人再去理会。
    登高一望，又是一幅劳动大军在进行战斗的瑰丽的图画，上下游的较远方，樯桅林立，说明这淮河中游商埠的重要和繁荣。中间横跨淮河两岸四个桥，紧紧的靠在一起，最下游的一个是原有的铁桥，在今年一月十五日被匪徒蒋介石命令其走卒刘汝明部用八十吨炸药破坏掉，妄想阻止人民解放军的前进以延缓江南小朝廷的命运。这桥象一条仇恨的巨练躺在那里，今天他只是起了一个作用，就是：每一个人看见都记起国民党残暴的统治；如此，每一个战士都会激起仇恨来，而加速我们前进的步伐，加速的建设新的桥和新的人民的国家。在这仇恨的巨练旁边十五米——四十五米的斜度里筑起来一条新的桥。在正式工作卅三天以后，象春笋一样，一个个木桥墩子，生长起来。十六个墩子和两个桥台全长四九八米的大桥，现在已经完成了十四个。在河中心还有两个墩子的沉箱正在进行安设，现在仅空下七十五米距离的激流在翻滚着浪花，工程负责同志说有六天时间就可将最后的两个箱子第七号、八号安放完毕。同样困难的工作已完成了四个，有了经验，这两个安放更有信心，以后就是架设钢梁，铺设钢轨，架桥机在桥北端已经装配好，等待完成最后的一笔。我们仔细看出这个新的桥各处都正在生长，第六号墩子上有个刁船在刁起木排架向上安放。这个刁船有一段历史，它是光绪年的产物，原来是一个老式的挖泥船，为疏浚淮河水道用的。蒸汽机已在腐锈，起重装置不是牙齿轮和复滑车，而是摩擦轮单滑车。找来后，经过修理，仅能刁动两吨。经过工程师的设计，机械技师胡俊峰和技术连机械排副排长王吉臣和技术连同志们研究改造，装添了一个长的刁臂和复滑车。它现在象大力士样能轻松的举起十吨左右的木排架，起了很大的作用。这个老船没有想到它今天参加了新中国的建设事业。第七号沉箱——十二米长六米宽七米高的庞然大物，现在它半浮在水上击在巨大的打桩船中间正在稳重的走向它的位置。
    打桩船系两个六十吨的铁驳船组成，上面架设了三台打桩机，每台十二米高；看去象三桅的大海船，这里同志给他起了一个光荣的名字，叫它“巡洋舰”。现在我们的“巡洋舰”上的“水手们”正在绞动四角的卷扬机，调动本舰的方向，和激流在斗争。在远第九号桥墩，昨夜才打桩完毕，象在水中生长出四排牙齿（每排十根），有一群木工在这牙齿岛上工作——把桩头锯平，把驮架安上去。从十号桥墩运到南岸是一条人的龙，在紧张的搬运石块，掷在沉箱在激起水花，战士们说是“打炮弹”。第十一号木排架早已组好，上面架了一个经纬仪，测量员在那里摇动手里的红旗——作旗语。
    河上汽船拖着木桩在走。在上游一百米处的河心里，停着一台平船，上面有四台卷扬机，它是固定在一条拦河的大钢丝绳上面，它离桥虽然远不为人注意，它却负担着一条最重要的任务，它可左可右，它能使“巡洋舰”和它带的沉箱上下左右移动，移动到我们需要的一定位置上。
    在第十号桥墩附近还停着两只船，船上有个小屋，门口还有栏杆，那上面装着潜水的器械服装，经常有人下到水底工作。这些水下英雄，有战士、还有从山东荣成县来的潜水工人。他们在回答并解决混浊的八、九米深的淮河激流下隐藏的秘密——是泥土还是石头，基础是平的还是斜的。他们还要在水下拴石头，摸钢绳，整平基础。
    在较远的河滩上一排排的帐篷下现在是空的，帐篷前的平地上架起一排排的枪支，一两个哨兵在看守着。帐篷顶上，有的骄傲的飘着红旗，上面写着“超过任务”或“完成任务”的白字。那是部队休息的地方，旁边冒着青烟，伙夫同志在烧水、做饭。
    桥两旁有宣传队制成的巨幅标语，有力的写着“战胜淮河洪水，提前完成任务”以及“提高技术，节省材料，爱护工具”等号召。
    在工作场所贯串两岸的是大小六十只民船组成的浮桥，象一条百足大虫伏在那里；上面滚滚的运输各处需用的材料。这差不多就是这幅伟大建设图画的全景。
    再上游不远是另一个现在正通行的浮桥，桥上很拥挤，有时成千百辆人推车，不断的推送粮食及物质过桥向南去。一辆载重汽车载着弹药过桥，则所有船家都爬出舱来，战战兢兢看着船，看着车，摇摇晃晃的慢爬过去，怕出危险似的，看到现在交通这样艰难，更说明行将修起的铁路大桥的意义重大。
    在这里，是巨量的劳动和现代的工程技术，和人民军队坚强的组织纪律党与政治工作三者相结合。
    所使用的材料，粗略统计：钢铁一百二十余吨，木材一万×千根，石头一万五方米……。所使用的机械有世界工程最新式的内燃打桩机，全中国唯一的双臂架桥机。该架桥机为这次苏德战争中苏联工程师所发明，曾得二等斯大林奖金，现使用者为东北三十六钢工厂工友所仿造。在技术上，因淮河地质复杂，北岸为游泥底，南岸为岩石，中心水深在八米以上，而日以继夜的工作，饱满的工作情绪，则因开展立功运动，以及发扬工程民主，而充分表现出我党我军的优良传统——把战斗的作风用之于工程建设。
    为响应铁道部滕、吕部长的号召“三月任务，两月完成”这个口号似乎已经有了现实的根据。从他们现在每日的工作计划上，象似还不满足，在追求着更好的成绩，来回答上级的号召，军事的要求，和人民的希望，准备在七月一日以前完成，做为给党的生日献礼！
    六月四日
