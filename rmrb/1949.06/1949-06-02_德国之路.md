　　The German Road
There is no other way to solve the German problem except to implement the principles of the Potsdam Agreement in order to eliminate Fascism and ensure that Germany becomes a member of the democratic and peaceful world. Because if Germany is not unified and democratic, the divided state that serves as a breeding ground for Nazis cannot be eliminated. Most importantly, without unification and democracy, the gold-dollar imperialism will further develop and take root in the West German war industry, and will eventually become a major factor threatening the peace and prosperity of Europe or even the world.
    If the "Bonn Constitution" is implemented throughout Germany, the divisive "federal idea" will be further encouraged, and Nazis may gain power through the various "states." Because in the four years after the war, within the American, British, and French occupied zones, we have solid and reliable evidence proving that the reactionaries have climbed back to the command post to act like overlords, while the working people are miserably abandoned in the abyss of suffering. For example, in the economic institutions in the American and British occupied zones, 1,600 out of 2,000 officials are former Nazis; the director of the grain bureau is the famous Junker aristocrat Xu Ninggen; the person in charge of reorganizing the steel industry is the former chairman of the German Steel Trust, Ding Kelbaha; and Roren, the "leader of the arms industry" who received Hitler's honorary award, has become the director of the new German Coal Mine Administration, and the "experts" hired by the United States, Britain, and France are almost all accomplices of Hitler! But in all political and economic institutions in West Germany, the trade unions of the working people do not have the right to speak! It is in this way that the American imperialists have taken advantage of the convenience of "aid to Britain and France" to become the master of West Germany alone, seeking markets and overseas investment resources for American monopoly capitalists. Therefore, the American imperialists' solution to the German problem is only to split Germany and resist the obligations that should be borne by international treaties.
    Therefore, the Soviet Union's proposal to liquidate the Hitler-style central government, pointing out the illegal actions of the United States, Britain, and France in West Germany in the past year and a half, and insisting on German democratic unity, and adhering to the four-power consensus principle, on the one hand, uses unified democracy to eliminate divisive conspiracies and eradicate the possibility of the resurgence of the Nazis; on the other hand, it opposes aggressive groups from using Germany to threaten world peace. The German people's cry for unity and just peace, the French mothers' warning to Schuman not to oppose the Soviet Union, and the world's democratic public opinion's repeated exposure of the conspiracy of the two-faced tricks of the United States and Britain, all these righteous actions and calls supported the Soviet Union's proposal for a unified Germany in the Foreign Ministers' meeting, and powerfully struck the wishful thinking of the warmongers!

　　德国之路
    解决德国问题没有别的途径，只有实行波茨坦协议原则，才能肃清法西斯主义，保证德国成为民主和平世界的一员。因为德国不统一民主，便不能消除纳粹分子们所依为温床的分裂状况，最主要的是，不统一民主，金元帝国主义便将在西德战争工业中进一步的发展、扎根，而终将成为威胁欧洲甚或世界的和平繁荣的重大因素。
    如果“波恩宪法”在全德实施的话，就是分裂性质的“联邦思想”得到更大鼓励，纳粹分子便可能经由各“邦”而取得权力。因为战后四年来，在美英法三占领区内，我们有确凿可靠的证据，证明了反动派重新爬到司令台上作威作福，而劳动人民却凄惨地被抛弃在苦难的深渊里。例如：在美英占区内的经济机构中，二千个官员中一千六百个是前纳粹分子，粮食局长是有名的容克贵族旭宁根；负责整理钢工业的是前德国钢业托拉斯董事长丁克尔巴哈；而得过希特勒荣誉奖赏的“军火工业领袖”罗伦已成了新的德国煤矿管理局的局长，为美英法所雇佣的“专家”，几全为希特勒的共谋犯！但在西德所有政治经济机构中劳动人民的职工会却没有发言的资格！也就是这样，美帝利用了“援助英法”的方便独自一个成了西德的主人，为美国独占资本家寻找市场和海外投资的财源。因此，美帝口中的德国问题解决办法，只是要分裂德国，而顽抗国际条约应担负的义务。
    所以，苏联的建议，清算希特勒式的中央政权，指出最近一年半以来美英法在西德的违法行动，而坚持德国民主统一，坚持四国一致原则，一方面是用统一民主可以消灭分裂阴谋，可以根除纳粹再起可能；另一方面，反对侵略集团利用德国威胁世界和平。德国人民要求统一及公正和平的吼声，法国母亲们致函舒曼不要反苏的警告，世界民主舆论一再揭发美英两面戏法的阴谋，这一切正义的行动与呼声，支持了苏联在外长会议中统一德国的建议，有力的打击了战争贩子们的妄想！
