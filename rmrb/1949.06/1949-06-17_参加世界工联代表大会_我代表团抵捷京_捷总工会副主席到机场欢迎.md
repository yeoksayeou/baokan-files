Xinhua News Agency, Prague, 16th – The Chinese delegation of thirty people, attending the Second Congress of the World Federation of Trade Unions, arrived in Prague on the afternoon of the 14th. The Vice-Chairman of the Czechoslovak Trade Union Council, Kiprou (formerly translated as Siprou), personally went to the airport to welcome them. In his welcoming speech, he said, "I feel very proud and honored to be able to welcome the victorious Chinese workers' delegation on Czechoslovak soil." He said: "The victory of the Chinese People's Liberation War has a significant impact on the struggle for peace and democracy throughout the world. We Czechoslovak workers firmly believe that the unity of the international working class, led by the Soviet Union, will surely guarantee the victory of the cause of world peace and democracy. And the final victory of the Chinese people is coming soon." Liu Ningyi, the head of the Chinese delegation, said in his reply: "The Chinese delegation, after passing through the great Soviet Union, has arrived in the new democratic Czechoslovakia. From the west coast of the Pacific to the long journey to Europe, all are lands of freedom and happiness for the people, which illustrates the greatness of the people's power centered on the Soviet Union. We Chinese people have shattered the US imperialist aggression plan in China and the rule of its running dog, Chiang Kai-shek. The reason for this victory is primarily due to the struggle of the Soviet Union, the new democratic countries, and the Western working class against imperialism, which has given us favorable conditions. We should express our deep gratitude to you, and we must unite and work hard for our common cause.” Liu Ningyi also expressed his deep belief that the Milan Congress will be a success.

    【新华社布拉格十六日电】参加世界职工联盟第二次代表大会的中国代表团一行三十人，已于十四日下午抵布拉格，捷克斯洛伐克总工会副主席祁普罗（以前译为西普罗）亲赴机场欢迎。他在欢迎词中说：“我能够在捷克斯洛伐克国土上来欢迎胜利的中国职工代表团，感到十分骄傲与荣幸。”他说：“中国人民解放战争的胜利，对全世界和平民主的斗争有重大的影响。我们捷克斯洛伐克工人深信，以苏联为首的国际工人阶级的团结，一定能保证世界和平民主事业的胜利。而中国人民的最后胜利，很快就要到来了。”中国代表团团长刘宁一在答词中表示：“中国代表团经过伟大的苏联到了新民主主义的捷克斯洛伐克。从太平洋西岸到欧洲的万里长途上，都是人民的自由幸福的国土，这说明了以苏联为中心的人民力量的伟大。我们中国人民已经粉碎了美帝国主义在华的侵略计划及其走狗蒋介石的统治。这一胜利的原因，首先是由于苏联、新民主主义国家，和西方工人阶级反对帝国主义的斗争，给了我们有利的条件。我们应该向你们深深的感谢，我们更要团结努力，为我们的共同事业而奋斗。”刘宁一并表示深信这次米兰大会一定能够成功。
