Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 3rd. To assist various factories in circulating capital, disbursing employee salaries, and rapidly resuming production, the Shanghai Military Control Commission's Financial and Economic Takeover Committee has ordered the Trade Office to purchase some finished products from private factories throughout the city and process orders. The Trade Office has now drafted provisional measures, stipulating that the total price of purchased finished products should not exceed one month's employee salaries for each factory in principle. If this amount is exceeded, temporary negotiations will be conducted. The price of finished products shall be discussed and agreed upon by the former trade associations of each factory and reported to the Trade Office for verification and approval. Factories requesting orders from the Trade Office may be required by the Trade Office, when deemed necessary, to find reputable manufacturers to be responsible for guarantees.
