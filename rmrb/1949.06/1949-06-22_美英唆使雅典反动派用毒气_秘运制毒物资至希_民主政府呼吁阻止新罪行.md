Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, June 21st: The Free Greece News Agency broadcast a communique issued by the Greek Provisional Democratic Government on the 18th, stating: "On the night of June 12th this year, American ships unloaded materials for manufacturing poison gas at Pirama, near Piraeus. These materials were loaded onto one hundred three-ton trucks, each escorted by three British soldiers. All traffic lines between Pirama and Piraeus were cut off by police cordons from 10:00 AM on June 12th to 9:00 AM on June 13th. The Provisional Democratic Government has received reliable information that the United States and Britain, failing to conquer the Democratic Army, intend to instigate the Greek reactionaries to use poison gas. We hereby urge the entire civilized world to pay attention to this new crime being prepared in Greece by the imperialist aggressors. We appeal to world opinion to protest and prevent the occurrence of this new crime."

    【新华社北平二十一日电】自由希腊通讯社十八日广播希腊临时民主政府发布的公报称：“本年六月十二日夜，美国船只在比里犹斯附近的比拉马卸下制造毒气的物资。这些物资已装上一百辆载重三吨的运货汽车，每辆汽车由三名英国兵护送。比拉马与比里犹斯间全部交通线，自六月十二日上午十时起至六月十三日上午九时止，为警察的警戒线所隔断。临时民主政府获得确实消息，美国和英国因为未能征服民主军而拟唆使希腊反动派使用毒气。我们谨促请整个文明世界注意此种正由帝国主义侵略者在希腊准备的新罪行。我们吁请全世界舆论提出抗议和阻止此种新罪行的发生。”
