Zhengding China University Branch Students
	Practice Thrift to Aid the Masses
	North China Government Issues Commendation
[Our Newspaper's Report] Due to the long-term rule of the Japanese invaders and the Kuomintang bandit gangs in Zhengding City, coupled with a partial crop failure last year and a severe drought this spring, some citizens and suburban residents are facing difficult living conditions. Thousands of students from the China University Branch in North China voluntarily decided to save two liang (approximately 100 grams) of rice per person per day, allocating a portion of their grain to the local government for disaster relief. Sixty percent of the students voluntarily donated one month's worth of pocket money (six jin of millet); and donated many extra quilts, blankets, and clothes. Female student He Xueyan even donated her engagement gold ring. In total, the donated materials amounted to over 11,200 jin of millet when converted to rice. The North China People's Government has issued a special commendation for this exemplary action; and calls on personnel of all government agencies to practice thrift according to the actual living conditions of each agency, in order to reduce financial expenditure and alleviate the burden on the masses.

  　华北政府特予表扬
    【本报讯】正定市因过去长期受日寇及国民党匪帮统治，去年又部分歉收，今春亢旱不雨，部分市民及郊区群众生活困难。华北大学分校数千同学即自动由每人每日节省二两米，拨出粮食一部，交给当地政府做救济灾民之用。有十分之六的同学自动捐出一月零用费（小米六斤）；并捐出许多多余的被褥衣毯，女同学何学彦把订婚的金戒指也捐了出来，总计所捐财物小米共合米一万一千二百多斤。华北人民政府对此模范行动特予表扬；并号召政府各机关人员应按照各机关实际生活情况进行节约，以减少财政开支，减轻群众负担。
