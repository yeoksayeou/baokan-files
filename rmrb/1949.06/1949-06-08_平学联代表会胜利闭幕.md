The Pingxuelian Representative Conference Successfully Concludes
[Ping City News] The first Second Representative Conference of the Beiping Student Federation successfully concluded on the morning of the 7th. During the three-day conference, the representatives discussed the Executive Committee's work report, as well as proposals on study and life. The Executive Committee's report on study issues was adopted, and the experiences of the Ping City Student Federation in promoting study since the First Representative Conference were summarized. The conference believes that the current phenomenon of disorganization and disorder in some middle schools, the incorrect understanding of education system reform by some teachers and students in universities, and the inability of unnecessary extracurricular activities to complement regular classes have become obstacles on the road to study today. The representatives enthusiastically discussed these issues and stipulated the basic principles for solving them. Comrade Peng Zhen, Secretary of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, also addressed these issues on the second day of the conference. In the closing remarks to the conference, the Presidium celebrated the success of the conference and hoped that the representatives would integrate the resolutions and spirit of the conference with the specific conditions of each school and convey them to all students. After the closing of the conference, all representatives were divided into two groups to visit the Teachers College Women's Affiliated High School, which is good at studying, and the Central University Affiliated High School, which has poor order.

　　平学联代表会胜利闭幕
    【平市讯】北平学联首届二次代表大会，已于七日上午胜利闭幕。在三天的会议中，代表们讨论了执委会的工作报告，以及关于学习及生活等提案，通过了执委会关于学习问题的报告，总结了第一次代表大会以来平市学联在推进学习中的经验。大会认为：目前某些中学还存在着的散漫无秩序现象，大学中某些师生对学制改革的不正确了解，以及不必要的课外活动不能与正课相配合等问题，成了今天学习道路上的障碍。代表热烈讨论了这些问题，并规定了解决这些问题的基本原则。中共北平市委书记彭真同志，并在大会第二日针对这些问题作了讲话。主席团在向大会致闭幕词时，庆祝大会的成功，并希代表们把大会的决议和精神与各校的具体情况结合起来，传达给全体同学。大会闭幕后全体代表曾分作两组到学习好的师大女附中和秩序较坏的中大附中参观。
