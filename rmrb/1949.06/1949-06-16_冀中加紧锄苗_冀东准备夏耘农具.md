　　Hebei Central Plain Hastens Weeding
　　Hebei East Prepares Summer Plowing Tools
　　[Hebei Central Plain Electric] Farmers in various parts of Hebei Central Plain are stepping up weeding in preparation for wheat harvesting. The Jian’guo County Party Committee, while mobilizing farmers for urgent planting, put forward the call to "men urgently plant, women weed and replant seedlings." The 42,000 mu of cotton in the county have basically completed seedling replanting and have been weeded once. In the sixth district of Qingyuan, the large fields of cotton planted before the rain have also been mostly weeded, and some have begun to thin the cotton seedlings. In some villages in Xinle, Raoyang, and Anguo, farmers have also completed sowing and shifted to weeding. The production work center in each village in the ninth district of Raoyang has also shifted to weeding, protecting seedlings, and protecting wheat. Farmers in Songzhuang, Xianxian County, are not only focusing on weeding, but also preparing for wheat harvesting. In order to realize this year's increased production plan, some farmers in Anguo and Ding County are seizing the gaps before the wheat harvest to collect grass and compost manure. In Wangqi Village, Anguo, 58 households are composting manure. In Licun Store, Ding County, 26 people go to the low-lying areas every day to pull grass to fill the pens. According to nine days of statistics, more than 3,000 jin of grass have been pulled, enough to compost twelve pens of manure.
　　[Hebei East Electric] Summer plowing is about to begin. The Hebei East Administrative Office has instructed governments at all levels and the supply and marketing cooperatives, general stores, and county stores to increase the production of 3,650 plowing hoes before the end of the fifth lunar month to help farmers solve the difficulty of lacking agricultural tools, and called on the masses to actively repair old plowing hoes, harrows, and hoe blades in preparation for summer plowing.
