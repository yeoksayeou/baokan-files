Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, June 24th: Moscow News: The mass rationalization reforms extensively carried out in Soviet industry continue to achieve great results. Workers, foremen, and engineers at the Molotov Automobile Factory in Gorky City have proposed 10,000 suggestions for rationalizing the production process in the past four months or so. These suggestions will save 30 million rubles annually. The application of these technical innovations has greatly increased the speed of producing trucks and buses compared to last year. For example, the automatic production assembly system in the engine department has shortened the time for turning pistons by 70 percent and the time for manufacturing gearboxes by 75 percent. More than a thousand workers in this factory have personal ledgers in which they record the raw materials and tools they use, as well as the time they save by improving work methods.

    实行群众性合理化改革
    苏联工业生产速度提高
    【新华社北平二十四日电】莫斯科讯：苏联工业中广泛进行的群众性的合理化改革，继续得到巨大成绩，高尔基城莫洛托夫汽车工厂的工人、领班和工程师在今年四个多月以来，已提出了一万种使生产过程合理化的建议，这些建议使一年内可节省三千万卢布。这些技术革新的应用，使生产卡车与客车的速度较去年大大增加。例如，引擎部的自动生产装配系统使以前旋活塞时间缩短了百分之七十，制造齿轮匣的时间缩短了百分之七十五。这个工厂有一千以上的工人都有个人的帐本，在里面记载有他们所使用的原料与工具的纪录，以及他们因改进劳动方法而节省的时间。
