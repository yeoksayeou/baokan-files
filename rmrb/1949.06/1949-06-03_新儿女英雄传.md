　　Episode 3: The Peasant Guerrilla Band (Cont. 2)
    Da Shui thought to herself, "This is strange. What kind of trouble is she having with Xiao Mei?" She hurried into the alley and found the courtyard where Xiao Mei lived. She called out twice, but no one answered. She went into the house and saw Xiao Mei sitting alone on the kang, her head drooping in a daze. Da Shui spoke to her, but she didn't raise her head or say a word. Da Shui quickly asked, "Xiao Mei, what's wrong?" Xiao Mei said angrily, "I quit!"
    Da Shui found it amusing and asked her what was going on. Xiao Mei said, "I'm not good at this work. I'm suffering this humiliation, and it's going to make me angry to death! ... Ah! Who knows, everyone says she's good, that she can't be delayed in work, that she can run errands, and they made her the women's director. Who knew she was a broken shoe! Bah! Shameless woman! She... she... she, in front of many people, actually scolded me for being a... a... broken shoe!" As she spoke, tears began to fall. Later, she simply fell onto the kang, pulled a quilt over her head, and started crying.
    Da Shui was confused and was about to ask her in detail when she heard Da Jin Ya shouting as she came in, "Where's Yang Xiao Mei? Let's go! Let's go to court!" Da Shui hurried to the courtyard and shouted at Da Jin Ya, "What are you doing?" Da Jin Ya waved her hands and said, "Humph! She removed me from this women's director position, which I don't care about anyway. What a good job! It can't be eaten, it can't be drunk, it doesn't matter whether I'm it or not; I have to ask her, on what basis did she say in front of everyone that I was keeping a lover, that I was a broken shoe, a promiscuous woman? I won't stand for it! I, Da Jin Ya, am not easy to mess with!"
    Da Shui sneered and said, "You're going to sue her just because she said you were keeping a lover? Are you actually keeping a lover?" Da Jin Ya rolled her eyes and said, "I'm talking to Yang Xiao Mei, it's none of your business, mind your own business!" As she spoke, she was about to go into the house to make trouble. Da Shui blocked the door and shouted, "Tell me! Why were Zhang Bao Yu and Da Pang San fighting in your house in the middle of the night? Why did Qian Lao Diao chase you down the street with a guillotine?... Tell me!" Da Jin Ya was deflated, but still said shamelessly, "This is a matter for our women's association, what relationship do you have with Yang Xiao Mei that you're helping her?" Da Shui pushed her and said, "Stop pretending, you can't win the lawsuit, get out of here!"
    Da Jin Ya walked to the gate, spat, and said, "Humph! Three nostril eyes, what right do you have to stick your nose in!" Then she wiggled her buttocks and left.
    Da Shui returned to the house, and Xiao Mei stood up to greet her, with tears still in her eyes, but smiling, she said, "Da Shui! You dug up her old dirt, which really gave me a breath of fresh air. I've really been bullied by this stinky woman!" Da Shui smiled and asked, "Aren't you quitting?" Xiao Mei said, "Why shouldn't I do it? If I don't do it, what else would I do?" Da Shui smiled and said, "That's right! You're bound to run into problems in your work, and everyone is the same! We Communists are not afraid of running into problems, the more we encounter them, the tougher we become, we become iron-headed, and then we're not afraid of anything!"
    Xiao Mei was happy and talked on and on about her work, saying that the women's work in that village was good and that the work in that village was not good; and that the women in West Fishing Village were very satisfied with the removal of Da Jin Ya as the women's director, and that the newly elected women's director, Xiu Nu Er, was capable and active and knew how to work. Da Shui was very happy to see that she was back on track, and after talking for a while, she wanted to go back. Xiao Mei asked her to stay for dinner, but she was worried about her work and hurried back to the central village.

    Eight

    In May, the wheat was turning yellow, and the farmers were busy harvesting in the fields. All the guerrilla teams in the district were deployed to the periphery to protect the wheat harvest.
    Niu Da Shui's group had been guarding the embankment for three days, and they hadn't seen any movement from the enemy on the other side of the river. The weather was very hot, and the katydids were chirping energetically in the willows along the embankment. Some of the team members were sitting or lying under the shade of the willows; some were helping the villagers harvest wheat in the fields; and some were splashing around in the deep part of the river.
    Suddenly, a scout came running from the other side of the river, wading across the river to report to the embankment that the enemy had reached Sand Beach Village. Sand Beach Village was just two miles across the river. Da Shui could see the villagers running around in a panic, which worried Da Shui very much. The old platoon leader quickly said, "Quick, blow the whistle to assemble!" Da Shui blew the whistle and ran along the embankment, shouting. The team members who were splashing around were flustered and came running with their rifles and clothes on, their bare bottoms exposed.
    Da Shui said, sweating, "The Japanese devils have reached Sand Beach Village, everyone prepare quickly, I don't tell you to fire, don't anyone fire your guns recklessly! Do you all remember those rules we set?" Everyone shouted, "We remember!" Da Shui said, "Good! That's it! I won't be polite to anyone who violates them!" The old platoon leader interjected loudly, "Military law is unforgiving!" Da Shui waved his hand, "Go!" The men ran to the embankment slope and lay down, guarding their posts.
    The old platoon leader told Da Shui to immediately send a liaison officer to report to Black Lao Cai. The liaison officer ran off. Da Shui was very worried, and carrying his box cannon, he ran from one end to the other, repeatedly instructing everyone: "This time, you must look carefully, aim accurately. Don't panic! Don't be reckless!" Everyone was lying motionless, nervously watching the village across the river.
    After waiting for a long time, the enemy didn't come over, which Da Shui found strange. The old platoon leader poked his head out, looking around, and suddenly said to Da Shui, "Ah! The enemy is already here!" It turned out that everyone was only paying attention to the village in front, and didn't realize that ten or so Japanese soldiers and puppet troops had come out of the woods on the right and were about to reach the river. Da Shui anxiously said, "What do we do?" The old platoon leader said, "Don't panic! The river is deep there, they have to cross from here. Immediately give the order, wait until they wade into the water and then fire at the same time!" Da Shui quickly spread the word: no one is allowed to fire recklessly, listen to the captain's command of one, two, and fire all together when two is called.
    Everyone showed their eyes, afraid to breathe, watching the enemies coming this way one by one with their guns, with a plainclothes traitor leading the way; after a while, they went around to the opposite bank of the river and began to wade into the river. Da Shui waited anxiously and shouted, "One! -" Who would have thought that Ai Heshang couldn't hold back and fired a shot, and everyone else fired together.
    The enemy was caught off guard and panicked, and quickly ran back. The traitor leading the way and a Japanese soldier were killed in the water. The team members kept firing their guns. The old platoon leader shouted, "Don't shoot if you can't see anyone! Save some bullets!" Gao Tun Er jumped out and shouted, "Go into the water to get the guns!" Several people followed and ran down the embankment, jumping into the water with a splash. Niu Da Shui shouted, "Don't all go down, be careful of the enemy!"
    After a while, Gao Tun Er came up with a Type 38 rifle on his back, others had helmets, some had bullets, laughing and joking. Ma Dan Xiao was still standing in the water. He was older than the others and moved the slowest. He was holding two waterlogged leather boots, pouring water out of them; Da Shui shouted loudly on the embankment, "Ma Dan Xiao, are you getting brave? Why aren't you coming up!" Ma Dan Xiao responded as he tied the straps of the two leather boots and put them around his neck, and then went to strip the silk gown from the traitor. The traitor's head was smashed, and white brains were floating on the water.
    In the afternoon, more enemy and puppet troops came out of Sand Beach Village on the other side. They were carrying the Rising Sun flag in front, and you could see a Japanese officer carrying a Japanese sword, and a bugler holding a shiny copper bugle... They walked to a spot 200 meters away from the river, near the woods, a flag waved on a high earthen mound, the copper bugle blew, the Japanese sword was drawn, and the enemies all scattered and ran this way.
    The guerrillas on the embankment were all panicked when they saw this. Niu Da Shui's heart couldn't help but beat wildly, thinking, "Damn it! So many of them are coming, how can we hold them off!" However, when he saw Black Lao Cai leading the county brigade rushing up, they all climbed onto the embankment slope and slammed the bolts of their guns. Black Lao Cai shouted loudly, "Get ready! Listen to my command! No one fire first!"
    On the opposite side, gunfire sounded, and bullets whizzed over their heads, making it impossible for the team members to raise their heads. Everyone was anxiously waiting for the order, but Black Lao Cai was staring intently at the other side without saying a word. The enemy charged under the cover of machine gun fire. The ones in front bent over, holding their bayonets as they charged. When they reached the river, they waded into the water. Black Lao Cai suddenly shouted, and everyone on this side fired at the same time. The enemies in front fell, and the enemies behind quickly retreated. The machine guns and rifles on the other side fired relentlessly. The enemy charged three times in a row, but were all driven back.

    Nine

    It was dark, and the enemy had retreated to Sand Beach Village. Gunfire was still sporadic. Fires could be seen burning outside the village on the other side. The voices of the Japanese devils could be heard "Wu - Oh -" shouting in disorder.
    It was the end of the month, and there were only dense stars in the sky. As soon as the gunfire stopped, the croaking of the frogs rang out. Da Shui and the others breathed a sigh of relief and felt that their throats were burning and unbearably thirsty. Ma Dan Xiao said, "Look! Who's coming?" Everyone turned around and saw a long string of dark shadows coming from afar, dimly, carrying and shouldering things. Black Lao Cai came over to Da Shui and said, "The villagers are here to comfort us! You guys go first, eat and drink something, and rest; let them hold the line here."
    Da Shui and the others retreated to under a few large trees and drank three large buckets of mung bean soup and rice porridge that were sent over. Shuang Xi distributed the cigarettes that the villagers had brought to everyone, and said comically, "You are all drinking like croaking frogs. Later, the women's association will bake pancakes, where will you put them?" Da Shui said with a smile, "My belly is full of fire, how can I eat pancakes?" Gao Tun Er loosened his belt and said, "It doesn't matter! Excrete some urine and the fire will be relieved!"
    The children's corps leader, Niu Xiao Shui, also came to help deliver bullets and hand grenades and went with Da Shui and the others to the embankment to take a look. Team member Liu Wu Zi asked, "Are there any more cigarettes?" Xiao Shui said, "Yes." He climbed up and handed him one, asking, "Wu Zi, are you tired?" Liu Wu Zi said, "Tired of what! It was so much fun fighting!" Xiao Shui thought that Wu Zi was only five or six years older than him, and was very envious, so he begged, "Brother Wu Zi, let me fire a shot and try!" Liu Wu Zi helped him load the bullet and taught him, "You have to hold the butt of the gun tightly against your shoulder, otherwise, the recoil will hurt you!"
    Xiao Shui held the gun, and his heart was beating wildly; he didn't dare to look up, and he didn't dare to look, he turned his face away and fired a shot with his eyes closed. Liu Wu Zi laughed at him and said, "You can't do it, what kind of shooting is that? Watch me!" He held a cigarette in his mouth, set up the gun, and stretched his head out to find a target, not wanting the enemy guarding outside the village to fire a shot at the cigarette flame, and Liu Wu Zi rolled down the embankment slope.
    Xiao Shui anxiously said, "Oh no! Liu Wu Zi has been hit!" Several people ran down to take a look, and he was already out of breath. Da Shui rushed over and scolded Xiao Shui until he cried. Black Lao Cai heard about it and quickly brought the civilians to carry the body away, and said to everyone, "It's all because of smoking! No one is allowed to smoke anymore! Everyone hide and monitor the enemy!"

    The Sickle Moon star turned to the west. Yang Xiao Mei led a group of women, carrying and lifting, to deliver dry food. When they arrived at a village a mile away from the embankment, they met Liu Shuang Xi. Shuang Xi said, "Black Lao Cai told you to just put it here, don't go any further." He led them into a large courtyard. There were several large pots in the courtyard, and many old men and women were busy boiling water and cooking porridge. (Attached image)

　　第三回　农民游击队（续二）
    大水心里想：“这可怪了。她跟小梅打的什么官司呀？”就急忙进了胡同，找到小梅住的院里，叫了两声，不见有人答应；进屋一瞧，小梅独个儿坐在炕上，搭拉着脑袋发呆呢。大水跟她说话，她头也不抬，话也不说，大水忙问：“小梅，你怎么啦？”小梅气呼呼的说：“我不干了！”
    大水听了很好笑，就问她是怎么回事。小梅说：“我不会作工作，受这份窝囊气，非把我气死不行！……唉！谁知道呢，人家都说她好，说她误得起工，跑得了腿，就叫她当了妇女主任，谁知道是个破鞋！呸！不要脸的娘们！她……她……她当着好些人，倒骂我是……是……破鞋！”她说着说着，眼泪就扑簌簌的掉下来；后来索性倒在炕上，拉条被子蒙着脑袋，哭开了。
    大水摸不着头脑，正要细细问她，就听见大金牙嚷着进来：“杨小梅在哪儿？走！咱们打官司去！”大水忙走到院里，喝问大金牙：“你闹什么？”大金牙指手划脚的说：“哼！她革了我这个妇女主任，这我倒不稀罕，什么好差事呀！顶不了吃，顶不了喝，当不当不吃紧；我得问问她，凭什么当着众人的面，说我养汉，说我是破鞋、浪荡娘们？我就不依！我大金牙可不是好惹的！”
    大水冷笑一声说：“你就为她说你养汉，要跟她打官司呀？你到底是不是养汉呢？”大金牙翻着个白眼：“我跟杨小梅说话，碍不着你的事，你少管闲事！”说着就要进屋去闹。大水挡住门口，喝着说：“你说说看！为什么张保玉和大胖三在你家里，半夜三更打起架来？为什么钱老刁拿个铡刀在街上撵你？………你说呀！”大金牙泄气了，可是还老着脸皮说：“这是我们妇会的事，你跟杨小梅沾什么亲，带什么故，要你帮她说话呀？”大水推她说：“别装蒜啦，官司打不赢，快走你的吧！”
    大金牙走到大门口，回头啐了一口，说：“哼！三个鼻窟窿眼儿，多出你这口气！”就扭着屁股出去了。
    大水回到屋里，小梅站起来迎她，眼里还带着泪花儿呢，可笑着说：“大水！你把她老底子翻出来，可给我出了一口气。我叫这臭娘们真欺负苦啦！”大水笑着问：“你不是不干啦？”小梅说：“为什么不干？不干，出来是做吗的呀！”大水笑着说：“着哇！干工作免不了碰钉子，谁还不是一样！咱们共产党员就不怕碰钉子，越碰越硬梆，碰成个铁头，就什么也不怕啦！”
    小梅欢喜了，絮絮叨叨的讲她的工作，说那村妇女工作好，那村不好；又说西渔村撤了大金牙的妇女主任，正经妇女都挺满意，新选的妇女主任秀女儿又能干，又积极，工作可有办法呢。大水看她又上了劲，也很高兴，说了一会话儿就要回去。小梅留他吃饭，他惦记着工作，就匆匆忙忙回中心村去了。
    八
    五月，麦梢黄了，庄稼人忙着下地收割。全区的游击队都调到边缘地带，保卫麦收。
    牛大水这一伙守着堤，已经三天了，还不见河那边敌人的动静。天气挺热，秦吉了在堤边的柳树上死鼓劲的叫，队员们在柳荫底下坐的坐，躺的躺；有的在地里帮老乡割麦；有的到河深的地方打扑腾去了。
    忽然，侦察员从河那边飞跑过来，趟水过河，到堤上报告，说敌人已经到了沙滩村了。沙滩村就在河对面二里地。大水望见，那边老百姓乱跑。可把大水急坏了。老排长忙说：“快吹哨子集合！”大水又吹哨子，又在堤上跑着喊叫。慌得那些打扑腾的队员们，也拿着大枪和衣裳，光着屁股跑来了。
    大水流着汗说：“鬼子已经到了沙滩村，大家赶快准备好，我不叫打，谁也别乱放枪！咱们订的那些条儿，你们都记住啦？”大家喊：“记住啦！”大水说：“好！就这么着！谁犯了也不客气！”老排长大声插嘴说：“军法不容情啊！”大水一挥手：“去吧！”人们都跑到堤坡上爬下，守住自己的岗位。
    老排长叫大水马上派交通员，去报告黑老蔡，交通员飞跑去了。大水很不放心，提着盒子枪，这头跑到那头，一路的叮咛大伙儿：“这回可得瞅好了，瞄得准准的。别慌！别乱！”大伙儿都一动不动的爬着，紧张的瞅住河对面的村子。
    等了好一阵，不见敌人过来，大水觉得挺奇怪。老排长探出个头儿，东瞧西看，突然对大水说：“啊呀！敌人已经到跟前了！”原来大家只注意前面那个村子，没提防十来个鬼子和伪军，已经从右边树林里出来，快到河边了。大水着急说：“怎么办？”老排长说：“别慌！那儿河水深，他们怎么着也得从这儿过。马上下命令，等他们趟水的时候一齐打！”大水就急忙把话往两头传：谁也不准乱放枪，听队长喊一二为记，喊到二字一齐打。
    大伙儿露出眼睛，气也不敢透，瞅着一个个敌人提着枪，鬼头鬼脑的往这边来，头里一个便衣的汉奸引着路；一会儿，就绕到了河对岸，开始趟河了。大水等得着急，喊了声：“一！——”谁想艾和尚沉不住气，就叭的一枪放了出去，大伙儿也一齐放开了。
    敌人冷不防，都吓慌了，连忙往回跑。引路的汉奸和一个鬼子打死在水里。队员们一个劲儿的放枪。老排长喊：“看不见人别打啦！省几颗子弹吧！”高屯儿跳出来，喊：“去水里摸枪哟！”几个人跟着跑下堤，扑通扑通的跳到水里去。牛大水喊：“别都下去，防备着点儿敌人吧！”
    一阵工夫，高屯儿背着一支三八大枪，别人有的戴着钢盔，有的拿着子弹，嘻嘻哈哈的上来了。马胆小还站在水里，他年纪比旁人大，动作最慢，手里拿着两只水淋淋的大皮靴，正往外倒水呢；大水在堤上高声喝着：“马胆小，你胆子大起来啦？还不上来！”马胆小一面应着，一面把两只皮靴的带儿挽住，套在脖子上，又去扒汉奸的纺绸挂儿。那汉奸的脑瓜打烂了，白花花的脑浆漂在水面上。
    下午，更多的敌伪军从对面沙滩村出来了。头里打着太阳旗，看得见一个日本军官挎着东洋大刀，还有号兵拿着亮闪闪的铜号………走到离河二百公尺，那边，树林跟前，高高的土墩儿上旗子一摆动，铜号吹起来了，东洋大刀出了鞘，敌人全散开，往这边跑。
    堤上的游击队，望着都慌了。牛大水心里也止不住扑通扑通直跳，想着：“妈的！一家伙来了这么些，怎么顶得住呀！”可是，他看见黑老蔡领着县大队呼呼呼的上来了，一下都爬在堤坡上，哗啦啦的拉着枪栓。黑老蔡声音响亮的喊：“准备好！听我的指挥！谁也别先开枪！”
    对面，枪声响了，子弹咝咝咝的从头顶上飞过，打得队员们抬不起头来。大家急着等口令，黑老蔡可紧盯着那边不作声。敌人在机关枪的掩护下面冲锋了，一个们弯着腰，端着刺刀冲过来，到了河边，就趟水。黑老蔡突然一声喊，这边乒乒乓乓一齐打过去。头里的敌人倒下去了，后面的敌人赶忙退回去，那边的机关枪步枪一股劲的打。敌人一连冲了三次，都给打了回去。
    九
    天黑了，敌人撤回沙滩村去了。枪声还稀稀拉拉的响着。望得见那边村外烧起一堆堆火。听得见鬼子的声音“呜——噢——”的乱叫。
    这一天正当月尽，天上只有星星稠掩掩的。枪声一落，蛤蚂的叫声就“格哇格哇”响起来。大水他们松了一口气，才觉得喉咙里象着火似的渴得难受。马胆小说：“你们瞧！谁们来了？”大家回头一望，瞧见远远的来了一大串黑影儿，隐隐糊糊，担的担，挑的挑。黑老蔡过来对大水说：“老乡来慰劳咱们啦！你们这一拨先去，吃点喝点，休息休息；让他们在这儿顶着。”
    大水他们撤到几棵大树下，把送来的绿豆汤、大米稀饭喝了三大桶。双喜把老乡们慰劳的烟卷儿发给大家，一面滑稽的说：“你们一个个喝得跟叫蝈蝈似的，停会儿妇会烙出饼来，你们装到哪儿去呀？”大水笑着说：“一肚子火，还吃得下饼？”高屯儿松松裤带说：“不碍事！撒两泡尿就把火儿泄出去啦！”
    儿童团长牛小水也帮着送子弹手榴弹来了，跟大水他们到堤根看看。队员刘五子问：“还有烟卷儿没有？”小水说：“有。”就爬上去递给他一支，问：“五子，你累了吧？”刘五子说：“累什么！打得可过瘾呢！”小水看五子不过比他大五六岁，心里挺羡慕，就央求说：“五子哥，让我也打一枪试试看！”刘五子帮他推上子弹，教给他说：“你得把枪托子紧紧顶住肩膀儿，要不，那坐劲儿非打痛了你不行！”
    小水端着枪，不知道怎么的心里乱跳；他不敢抬头，也不敢看，别转脸，闭着眼儿打了一枪。刘五子笑他说：“你不行，这叫什么打枪呀？瞧我的！”他叼着烟卷，架好枪，伸出头去想找个目标，不想在村外警戒的敌人，照着烟卷火儿打了一枪，刘五子骨碌碌的滚下堤坡去了。
    小水着急说：“坏了！打着刘五子了！”几个人跑下来一看，已经断了气。大水奔过来，气得把小水骂哭了。黑老蔡听说，忙带着民夫来把尸首抬走，对大伙儿说：“都是抽烟的过！谁也不准抽烟了！大家把身子隐蔽住，好好儿监视敌人！”
    罗锅星转到西天了。杨小梅带着一帮子妇女，扛的扛，抬的抬，来送干粮。到了离堤一里地的村子，碰见刘双喜。双喜说：“黑老蔡叫你们就放在这儿，别往前走了。”他领她们走进一个大院子。院子里支着几口大锅，好些老头老婆在忙着烧水熬粥呢。（附图片）
    游击队捞胜利品。牛大水喊：“马胆小，你胆子大起来啦？”
