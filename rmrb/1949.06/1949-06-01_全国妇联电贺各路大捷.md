Xinhua News Agency, Beiping, May 31st: The All-China Democratic Women's Federation sent a telegram congratulating the People's Liberation Army's field armies. The telegram is as follows:

To Generals Peng Dehuai, Zhang Zongxun, and Zhao Shoushan of the First Field Army of the Chinese People's Liberation Army; Generals Liu Bocheng, Deng Xiaoping, and Zhang Jichun of the Second Field Army of the Chinese People's Liberation Army; Generals Chen Yi, Rao Shushi, Su Yu, and Tan Zhenlin of the Third Field Army of the Chinese People's Liberation Army; Generals Lin Biao and Luo Ronghuan of the Fourth Field Army of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, and all commanders and fighters of the field armies:

Since late April, our heroic People's Liberation Army, with irresistible force, has successively liberated major cities such as Nanjing, Taiyuan, Hangzhou, Hankou, Wuchang, Hanyang, Xi'an, Jiujiang, and Nanchang. Most recently, it liberated Shanghai, China's largest industrial and commercial metropolis. From now on, we have not only destroyed the military and political rule of the Kuomintang reactionaries, but also occupied its largest economic nest. Shanghai has long been used by imperialists as a base for aggression. Today's liberation has made people all over China and the world who support national independence and people's democracy ecstatic, and has given greater confidence to the democratic forces around the world who oppose war and strive for peace. In our joy, we send a special telegram to congratulate you.

All-China Democratic Women's Federation, May 30th

　　全国妇联电贺各路大捷
    【新华社北平三十一日电】中华全国民主妇女联合会电贺人民解放军各野战军，电文如下：
    中国人民解放军第一野战军彭德怀、张宗逊、赵寿山诸将军，中国人民解放军第二野战军刘伯承、邓小平、张际春诸将军，中国人民解放军第三野战军陈毅、饶漱石、粟裕、谭震林诸将军，中国人民解放军第四野战军林彪、罗荣桓诸将军及各野战军全体指战员诸同志：
    自从四月下旬以来，我们英勇的各路人民解放军，以破竹之势，接连解放了南京、太原、杭州、汉口、武昌、汉阳、西安、九江、南昌等各大城市。最近又解放了中国最大工商业都市上海。从此我们不仅已经摧毁了国民党反动派军事政治的统治，而且已经占领了它最大的经济巢穴。上海久已被帝国主义者当作侵略的根据地，今天的解放，使全中国和全世界拥护民族独立、人民民主的人们，欢欣若狂，对全世界反对战争，争取和平的民主力量，有了更大的信心。我们欢欣之余，特电致贺。
    中华全国民主妇女联合会五月三十日
