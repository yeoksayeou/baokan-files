　　Central Hebei Public and Private Deposits Increase
  　Value-Guaranteed Savings Also Become More Active
    [Central Hebei News] Banks under the jurisdiction of the Central Hebei Branch of the People's Bank of China have seen increases in both public and private deposits in May. According to statistics from eighteen branches, a total of 574,700,360 yuan was deposited, of which public funds accounted for 70.8%, an increase of 29.2% over the previous month. The main reasons for the increase in deposits are: (1) State-owned enterprises sold goods and collected payments through banks. (2) After city conferences, local branches thoroughly implemented the policy of vigorously absorbing deposits and strengthened contact with depositors. (3) The opening of loans stimulated private business deposits. For example, overdraft accounts in Ding County, which had been interrupted for some time, have been actively requesting transactions, and 13 new accounts have been opened. (4) Price levels were stable in late May, and currency turnover was slower.
    Value-guaranteed savings have also increased significantly. In addition to using newspapers for publicity, the branch's business office also sent special personnel to factories and government agencies for liaison. After the branch's business office added a savings section on May 20, business has been significantly more active. The number of savings accounts has increased from 364 in April to 573, and the amount has increased from 1,030,700 yuan to 2,797,300 yuan. The other twenty-three branches saw 7,668 value-guaranteed depositors in May, with 2,316 "real unit" accounts, totaling 1,743,899 yuan.

　　冀中公私存款增加
  　折实储蓄亦趋活跃
    【冀中讯】中国人民银行冀中分行所属各地银行，五月份吸收公私存款均有增加。按十八个行处统计，共存入五亿七千四百七十万零三千六百元，其中公款占百分之七十点八，较上月增加百分之二十九点二。存款增加之主要原因：（一）国营企业抛售物资，通过银行代收款项。（二）各地行处在城市会议后，都贯澈了大力吸收存款的方针，加强了对存户的联系。（三）放款的开放刺激了私商存款，如定县间断已久的透支户又纷纷要求往来，现又重新立摺的达十三户。（四）五月下旬物价平稳，货币周转较慢。
    折实储蓄也有显著增加。分行营业处除利用报纸宣传外，并派出专人到工厂机关进行联络。分行营业处五月二十日添设储蓄股后，业务显著活跃，现储存户由四月份的三百六十四户增至五百七十三户，金额由一百零三万零七百元增至二百七十九万七千三百元。其他二十三个行处，五月份折实存款者七千六百六十八个饻，“实物单位”二千三百十六个，共折款一百七十四万三千八百九十九元。
