Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, June 11th. Moscow dispatch: The latest issue of the "New Era" magazine published an editorial entitled "The Principle of Unanimous Agreement," stating: The progress of the Paris Foreign Ministers Conference provides abundant material for reflection for all those who are eager to know the real reasons why it is difficult to achieve peace. Of particular significance in this regard is the debate on the principle of unanimous agreement among the four powers on the issue of controlling Germany during the occupation period.

　　The most prominent feature of the current attitude of Western countries is the endless wrangling over the principle of unanimous agreement in the Allied control mechanism. This principle is under fierce attack by the representatives of the three Western powers at the Paris Foreign Ministers Conference. U.S. Secretary of State Acheson called it: an old method of reaching international agreements. Acheson, Bevin, and Schuman want to replace this "old method" with a new method—passing resolutions by majority vote.

　　This demand to abandon the "old method" and advocate for decisions by majority vote clearly reflects the essence of the disagreement.

　　The principle of unanimous agreement is the customary and universally adopted method in international affairs when the issue is passing decisions binding on equal and autonomous countries.

　　The historic decisions of the Potsdam Conference also stipulated that decisions on all issues related to the occupation of Germany and the making of peace should be made on the principle of unanimous agreement. The Council of Foreign Ministers, established in accordance with the Potsdam Agreement, uses this principle as the basis for its work. The four powers also adopted this principle in matters related to the Control Council and the Allied Command in Berlin, and reached a series of agreements.

　　However, in recent years, Western countries have abandoned this policy of striving for unanimous decisions, preferring instead the opposite policy of unilateral decisions, as well as privately agreeing behind the back of the fourth occupying power—the Soviet Union—on faits accomplis, and attempting to forcefully impose their will on the Soviet Union. This policy of ordering the Soviet Union around has no hope of success. Nevertheless, some people are still trying to continue this hopeless and discredited policy. The representatives of Western countries insist that the principle of unanimous agreement makes it impossible to pass practical decisions, a far-fetched argument that cannot withstand the slightest criticism. Experience has shown that in the early days of the occupation of Germany—when the Western powers had not yet decided to completely abandon the Potsdam decisions—the German Control Council and the Allied Command in Berlin performed their duties normally. Naturally, difficulties arose during the work of these institutions, but these difficulties were overcome and successfully resolved by the method of unanimous decision. As Molotov rightly pointed out at the Moscow Foreign Ministers Conference on April 2, 1947: "If the Control Council abandons the principle of unanimous agreement and favors passing resolutions by majority vote, then the Control Council will be in danger of collapsing. This danger is much more serious than delaying the making of this and that designation."

　　Experience has also proven that the Allied Command in Vienna satisfactorily performs its duties based on the principle of unanimous agreement. Finally, all international conferences and agreements prove the vitality and practical feasibility of the principle of unanimous agreement.

　　So, what is the difficulty? Why is the natural and normal method of resolving international issues under such fierce attack? The opponents of the principle of unanimous agreement are eager to obtain every opportunity to order others around, and they are not even satisfied with the method of majority vote. For example, in the Washington agreement on the three-power control of West Germany, there is a point that stipulates that in certain circumstances, the votes of the three-power control agencies should be directly proportional to the funds allocated by each of the three countries to Germany. Vyshinsky was quite right to call everyone's attention to this point when he said: "This voting method is not only arbitrary, but it can also be said to be financial dictatorship. This is neither majority voting nor unanimous voting, but one-person voting. It is a method of giving one person in the control agency the right to decide everything. This voting method can be accurately called 'dollar voting,' because if the United States gives Germany dollar 'aid,' then it will have the decisive voting power."

　　This dollar-oriented approach to solving international problems exposes the true face of the consistent advocates of so-called "Western democracy." They find it annoying to consider the legitimate interests of other countries and are eager to act freely to forcibly pass unilateral decisions on international issues. But what does this have to do with democracy? The attack on the principle of unanimous agreement exposes the attempt by representatives of Western countries to oppose sincere international cooperation on an equal basis and to adopt democratic decisions on various international issues. The politicians of Western countries, opposing the universally adopted principle of unanimous agreement in international affairs and supporting the policy of blatant financial dictatorship by American monopoly capitalists, are bearing a heavy responsibility.

### 全体一致协议的原则　新时代杂志社论

　　全体一致协议的原则
  　新时代杂志社论
    【新华社北平十一日电】莫斯科讯：最新出版的新时代杂志，以“全体一致协议的原则”为题发表社论称：巴黎外长会议的进程，对于一切亟欲知道缔造和平何以发生困难的真正原因的人，提供了丰富的可供思考的资料。在这方面，有特别意义的，就是关于占领期间四国在管制德国问题上一致协议的原则的辩论。
    现时西方国家的态度的最大特点，就是在盟国管制机构中执行一致协议的原则问题上争执不休。这一原则正受到西方三国代表在巴黎外长会议上的猛烈攻击。美国国务卿艾奇逊称：这是达成国际协议的老方法。艾奇逊和贝文与舒曼想以新的方法——以多数票通过决定——来代替这种“老方法”。
    这种抛弃“老方法”而主张以多数票通过决定的要求，明显地反映出分歧的本质。
    当问题是通过对各平等与自主的国家具有约束性的决定的时候，全体一致协议的原则，是国际事务上惯常与普遍采用的方法。
    波茨坦会议的历史性的决定，也规定在对一切有关德国占领与缔造和平的问题上以全体一致协议的原则作出决定。按照波茨坦协定而设立的外长会议，就是以这一原则为其工作之基础的。四国在有关管制委员会与柏林盟国司令部问题上，也采用这一原则，并达成了一连串的协议。
    但是，最近几年来，西方国家抛弃了这种力求达成一致决定的政策，而偏爱那种与此相反的片面决定的政策、以及那种背着第四个占领国——苏联而私自协议的既成事实，和那种命令强使苏联接受他们底意志的企图。这种对苏联下命令的政策，是毫无成功的希望的。虽然如此，但还有人企图继续奉行这种毫无希望的和声名狼藉的政策。西方国家的代表，硬说全体一致协议的原则使各项实际的决定不可能通过，这种牵强附会的论断是经不起丝毫批评的。经验证明：在占领德国的初期——当西方强国尚未决定完全抛弃波茨坦决定时——德国管制委员会和柏林盟国司令部曾正常地执行了职务。自然，在这些机构进行工作的过程中，曾发生过困难，但这些困难曾被一致决定的方法所克服和胜利地解决了。正如莫洛托夫于一九四七年四月二日在莫斯科外长会议上十分正确地指出的：“如果管制委员会抛弃了全体一致协议的原则，而赞成以多数票通过决定的话，那么，管制委员会就将有崩溃的危险。这一危险要比延缓作出这一和那一指定的危险严重得多。”
    经验又证明：维也纳盟国司令部根据全体一致协议的原则而令人满意地执行着职务。最后，一切国际会议和协定，均证明全体一致协议的原则之活力和实际上的可以实行。
    那么，困难是什么呢？为什么决定国际问题的自然而正常的方法受到如此猛烈的攻击呢？全体一致协议的原则的反对者，亟欲获取一切命令他人的机会，他们甚至不满意大多数表决的办法。例如，关于三国管制西德的华盛顿协议中，有一点就规定，在某些场合下，三国管制机构的票数，应与各该三国拨给德国的款项成正比例，维辛斯基为促使大家注意这点，曾十分正确地说过：“这种表决方法，不仅是一种专断，而且可以说是财政独裁。这既不是多数表决，也不是一致表决，而是一人表决。那是一种给管制机构的某一人员以决定一切权利的方法。这种表决方法可以正确地称之为‘美元表决’，因为如果美国予德国以美元‘援助’的话，那么，它就有决定的表决权。”
    这种解决国际问题的美元方针，暴露了所谓“西方民主”一贯的拥护者的真面貌。他们觉得考虑他国底正当利益是讨厌的，而且亟欲自由行动以对国际问题强行通过片面的决定。但是，这和民主又有什么关系呢？对全体一致协议的原则实行攻击，使西方国家代表们反对在平等基础上实行忠诚的国际合作和在各种国际问题上采取民主决定的这一图谋，原形毕露。西方国家底政客们，反对国际事务上所普遍采用的全体一致协议的原则，和支持美国垄断资本家露骨的财政独裁的政策，他们正担负着严重的责任。
