    Proper Leadership of Trade Company Improves Yuci Cloth Quality
    [Taiyuan Electricity] The Yuci branch of the Taiyuan Municipal Trade Company has achieved preliminary success in leading the Yuci weaving industry to improve product quality. In recent years, the Yuci weaving industry has developed considerably with the support of the People's Government, but the quality of its products remains poor. After the liberation of Tianjin and Beijing, the import of cloth from Tianjin and Beijing sharply reduced the sales of Yuci cloth. In March of this year, the Trade Company proposed improving the Yuci ten-pound coarse foreign cloth, welcoming factories to sign contracts with the company to weave standard cloth, which the company would then purchase and promote. At that time, more than twenty factories signed contracts with the Trade Company. In early May, the Trade Company convened a cotton textile evaluation symposium to study the quality of standard cloth. The evaluation result showed that the products of Jin Cheng and Li Min factories had reached the prescribed standards and were specially commended. For those with poor quality, it was decided to deduct yarn according to the quality. The worst performer was the Tong Xin factory, which, after signing a contract with the Trade Company and receiving twenty-nine bundles of bottom yarn, sold twenty bundles and engaged in speculation, failing to deliver the cloth on time. It was decided to request the government to handle the matter according to law. After this evaluation, the output of more than ten factories, including Jin Cheng, Li Sheng, and Li Min, has exceeded the prescribed standards. The company is currently studying ways to increase profits or implement material rewards for factories that exceed the standards, with a view to further improvement.

    贸易公司领导得法
    榆次布质量提高
    【太原电】太原市贸易公司榆次分公司，领导榆次织布业提高产品质量，已获初步成绩。榆次织布业年来在人民政府扶助下，已有相当发展，但产品质量仍低劣；平津解放后，平津布匹输入，榆次布销路锐减。贸易公司乃于今年三月，提出改良榆次十斤粗洋布的建议，欢迎各工厂与公司订立合同，织标准布，由公司收购推销。当时与贸易公司订定合同者即有二十余家。五月上旬，贸易公司召开棉织品评判座谈会，研究标准布优劣。评定结果，金城、利民两厂出品已达规定标准，特予嘉奖。质量低劣的，决定按质扣纱。做得最坏的为同心厂，该厂与贸易公司订定合同，领到底纱二十九捆后，即将二十捆卖掉，投机倒把，到期不交布，决请政府依法处理。经过此次评判后，金城、力生、利民等十余家工厂，出品已超出规定标准。对超过标准之工厂，刻正研究提高利润或实行实物奖励，以期更进一步改进。
