　　People's Bank Changxindian Office
  　Real Value Savings Business Carried Out
  　Deeply Welcomed by Factory Workers
    [Our Newspaper] Changxindian's workers welcome real value savings. In twenty days, as many as 627 accounts were opened. The Savings Department of the People's Bank of Beiping Branch regularly sends personnel to be stationed at the Changxindian Office of the Cooperative Bank to assist the local area in developing savings business. From June 1st to 20th, a total of 627 accounts were developed, absorbing a total of 4,289 physical units. Workers account for the majority of all savings accounts, with the rest being staff members, etc. The most common type of savings is zero-deposit lump-sum withdrawal. The rapid development of the business is mainly due to in-depth introductions and enthusiastic help from workers. The personnel stationed in Changxindian by the department, in conjunction with the Changxindian Office of the Cooperative Bank, conducted investigations and introductions to 15 units of various factories in more than half a month, and used the spare time of general meetings to introduce the rules and regulations of real value savings, explaining the benefits of savings to the workers themselves. Because some workers have a low level of education and it is not easy to understand the rules and regulations, a method of connecting with reality is adopted, such as introducing to workers: if each person uses the zero-deposit lump-sum withdrawal method, depositing one unit each time (every half month) wages are paid, a set of uniforms can be made after six months; depositing ten units each time, a bicycle can be bought after half a year. In the promotion of this business, we received automatic assistance from workers, such as workers from the switchboard of the telecommunications section using spare time to convey daily price quotations for the bank, which also greatly facilitated this work.

　　人民银行长辛店办事处
  　折实储蓄业务开展
  　深受各厂职工欢迎
    【本报讯】长辛店的职工欢迎折实储蓄，二十天内开户的有六百二十七户之多。人民银行北平分行储蓄部派员经常驻在合作银行长辛店办事处，协助当地开展储蓄业务，自六月一日至二十日共发展了六百二十七户，总计吸收四千二百八十九个实物单位。全部储蓄户中工人占大多数，其他为职员等。储蓄种类以零存整付最多。业务之所以能迅速开展主要是由于介绍的深入和工人热心的帮助。该部派驻长辛店的人员配合合作银行长辛店办事处，在半个多月时间里，先后对各厂所十五个单位进行调查介绍，并利用举行全体会的空隙时间介绍折实储蓄的章则，说明储蓄与职工切身的好处。因有的工人文化水准较低，对章则不易了解，特采用联系实际的方法，如向工人介绍：每人用零存整付的方式，每次（半月）发薪存入一个单位，六个月期满可以做一套制服，每次存十个单位，半年后可买一辆自行车。在推行这一业务时，得到工人自动的协助，如电务段交换所的工人利用空隙时间替银行传达每日牌价等，也给这一工作很大的便利。（宇）
