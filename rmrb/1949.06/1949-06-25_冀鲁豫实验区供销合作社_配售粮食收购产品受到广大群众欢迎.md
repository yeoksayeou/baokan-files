    Hebei-Shandong-Henan Experimental Zone Supply and Marketing Cooperative
    Distribution of Grain and Purchase of Products Welcomed by the Broad Masses
    [Hebei-Shandong-Henan Electric] The Hebei-Shandong-Henan District Supply and Marketing Cooperative General Office held a cadre meeting of various experimental zones on the 7th of this month, summarized the experience of trial operations in May, criticized various erroneous viewpoints, and put forward the overall tasks for the future. In May, a central market town cooperative and the Puyang Chengguan Cooperative were established in each of the eight key pilot counties in this district. Some have been operating for nearly a month, while others have only been established for a week. The eight units have developed a total of 5,278 members. Because it was the spring famine season, the main business operation was to distribute grain to the members, distributing a total of 129,000 jin of seven kinds of miscellaneous grains, plus a portion of industrial products, worth more than 3.5 million yuan, giving the members a direct benefit of more than 370,000 yuan, and eliminating transaction fees. Therefore, the supply and marketing cooperatives are welcomed by the broad masses. In terms of business activities, some county cooperatives have begun to pay attention to member production and the purchase of finished products. For example, Qingfeng and Nanle purchased hoes from Huolu County, 500 li away; Qingfeng, Nanle, and Guancheng and other cooperatives purchased straw braid hats from members at higher prices; Puyang Cooperative purchased vegetable oil from members, etc. These areas have met the requirements of the broad masses of members. The general purchasing power of members is not high, only the members in the Qing (feng), Nan (le), and Guan (cheng) braiding industry areas are relatively better because the braiding industry has initially recovered. Based on this situation, the meeting decided that in the future, in addition to continuing to operate the distribution business and purchase agricultural products, it should pay more attention to supporting mass production, vigorously operating the braiding and oil industries, and increasing the purchasing power of members; the second is to organize members to order consumption plans. According to a survey of more than 600 members in Nanle, two-thirds requested to buy hoes, and one-third requested to buy plows. Members in the braiding and oil-producing areas requested to purchase their finished products. Gaoling County Cooperative is preparing to distribute autumn seedling seeds to members, and if it rains later, it will prepare to distribute buckwheat, radish seeds, etc. Nanle County Cooperative plans to purchase autumn farming tools to solve the difficulties of members' production tools. The third is to expand the scope of operations, increase credit loans, and accept the task of collecting and purchasing on behalf of state-owned stores. In controlling the distribution price, the mechanical implementation of price negotiation every three days failed to raise prices in a timely manner when prices rose, resulting in prices that were too different from the market, as much as 10% to 40% lower than the market, resulting in losses. The meeting stipulated that the pricing in the future should maintain: (1) cost plus operating expenses; (2) 3% to 5% lower than the market price; (3) strive for a profit of 3% to ensure the principal in kind. At the same time, pay attention to market trends. If it is to stabilize prices, it can also be sold at a loss. In business operations, the cadres' view of serving the masses still needs to be strengthened.

### 冀鲁豫实验区供销合作社  配售粮食收购产品受到广大群众欢迎

    冀鲁豫实验区供销合作社
    配售粮食收购产品受到广大群众欢迎
    【冀鲁豫电】冀鲁豫区供销合作总社于本月七日召开各实验区干部会议，总结了五月份的试办工作经验，批判了各种错误观点，并提出今后总的任务。五月间本区八个重点试办县内各建立了一个中心集镇社及濮阳城关社。有的营业近月，有的成立仅一星期，八个单位共发展社员五千二百七十八人。因正值春荒时节，业务经营上主要是配售给社员粮食，共配售七种杂粮十二万九千余斤，加上一部分工业品共值三百五十万余元，使社员得三十七万余元的直接利益，并免除了交易费，因此供销合作社得到广大群众的欢迎。在经营活动上，有的县社已开始注意到社员生产及收购成品，如清丰、南乐从五百里外的获鹿县购来锄；清丰、南乐、观城等社以较高价格收购社员的草帽辫，濮阳社收购社员的植物油等，这些区均符合了广大社员的要求。社员一般购买力不高，只有清（丰）、南（乐）、观（城）辫业区社员因辫业初步恢复，还比较好一些。据此情况，会议决定今后除继续经营配售业务及收购农产品外，更注意支持群众生产，大力经营辫业油业，增进社员购买力；其次是组织社员订消费计划。据南乐六百余社员的调查，三分之二要求买锄，三分之一要求买犁。产辫区及产油区社员要求收购其成品。高陵县社准备配售社员以秋苗种子，如下雨较晚即准备配售荞麦、萝卜子等。南乐县社则计划购买秋季农具，解决社员生产工具的困难。第三扩大经营范围，增办信用贷款，并接受为国营商店代收代购委托任务。在掌握配售价格上，机械的执行了三天议价一次，当物价上升时，未能及时提高，致价格与市场悬殊太大，竟有低于市场百分之十至百分之四十，而致亏本者。会议规定今后的定价要保持：（１）成本加营业费。（２）低于市价百分之三至五。（３）争取实物保本之百分之三的利润。同时注意市场趋势，如为稳定物价也可亏本售出。在营业上干部为群众服务的观点，仍须加强。
