To Present a Gift to the CCP's "July 1st" Anniversary, Railway Workers Compete in Production
    Changxindian and Beiping Sections and Factories Rush to Repair Locomotives; Tangshan Locomotive Depot Challenges All North China Counterparts

    [Reported by this newspaper] Railway workers in Changxindian and Beiping are launching a widespread production competition to welcome the 28th anniversary of the founding of the Communist Party of China on "July 1st."

    The Changxindian Engineering Section first convened an expanded section affairs meeting on May 25th, at which various competitive conditions were proposed, and a challenge was issued to all engineering sections in the Pingjin area. Specific plans were drawn up for bridges, road maintenance, and construction, striving to complete tasks ahead of schedule, add extra projects, and ensure the complete and perfect fulfillment of responsibilities. At the same time, it was decided that all employees would collect railway materials along the line; materials stored in the villages where employees live, no matter how far away, would be transported and collected by themselves without using public transportation fees.

    The Changxindian Machinery Factory's undercarriage workshop is preparing to repair two undercarriages before "July 1st," working overtime without extra pay. Workers at the electrical repair factory are currently studying the改造 of five generators in preparation for "July 1st." The telecommunications section held a general meeting of all employees on May 28th, and everyone agreed that the switchboard should be well protected and that telecommunications equipment should be guaranteed to be free from obstacles and that electricity should be supplied as usual; outside of working hours, the wooden railing of the switchboard should be removed and a wall built using old bricks. The locomotive section decided that outside of working hours, without overtime pay and without occupying the Class A inspection platform, they would revive an old locomotive.

    All employees of the Beiping Locomotive Depot's engine house held a meeting on May 30th and decided to repair a "National Liberation" locomotive in addition to their regular work, as a gift to the Communist Party of China's "July 1st" birthday. Zhao Ming, a labor model who repaired the Beiping "May 1st" locomotive, said: "We must use the spirit of completing the 'May 1st' locomotive to complete the repair of the 'National Liberation' locomotive." Workers in the boiler, electrical, and riveting departments have guaranteed to complete their repair work as soon as possible, striving to have the locomotive leave the factory before June 20th; after leaving the factory, they also guarantee safe travel of 40,000 kilometers within three months (exceeding the standard of 30,000 kilometers for generally better locomotives), and maintain the cleanliness of the locomotive forever.

    All employees of the Beiping Inspection Section will renovate a "July 1st" passenger car outside of work as a gift to the CCP's anniversary. At a general meeting of all workers on June 3rd, five specific methods and standards for completing the work were discussed: 1. Materials should be used as much as possible from waste materials and substitutes, using the spirit of hard work and building a family to overcome various difficulties. 2. Establish a style of unity and mutual assistance, divide labor and help each other, so that all departments can complete their tasks and establish a sense of the whole. 3. The leadership should promptly check and help, and carry out appropriate praise and encouragement. 4. Adopt competition methods for each department to ensure that the work is done well and quickly. 5. After the train is rushed for repair, it must meet the repair standards of the machinery factory.

    [Tangshan Electric] Inspired by the glorious achievement of locomotive No. 884 of the Hailar Locomotive Depot in Northeast China safely traveling 110,000 kilometers, all workers of the Tangshan Locomotive Depot proposed to all locomotive depots in North China: to challenge with the conditions of safely traveling 40,000 kilometers and breaking through a Class A inspection period (each Class A inspection period is 40,000 kilometers) as a gift from all workers of the depot to the "July 1st" festival. After a heated discussion at the crew meeting on the second of this month, it was decided to use locomotive No. 602 as a representative, driven by nine crew members including Wu Minchun, and specific challenge conditions were stipulated, such as: safely traveling 40,000 kilometers, breaking through 80,000 kilometers of travel before Class A inspection (that is, breaking through a Class A inspection period), including daily and regular inspection and repair, including daily and scheduled lubrication, self-cleaning of the furnace, increasing the kilometers traveled after cleaning the furnace, and guaranteeing no missed work, no missed shifts, no leave, ensuring the daily cleanliness and good condition of the locomotive, abiding by the responsible labor discipline, the repair work outside the locomotive section, except for the indirect work of the boiler wind brake department, is all the responsibility of the crew, saving coal and fuel, reducing consumption, etc. All workers of the section believe that this is the glory of the Tangshan Locomotive Depot, and they must support locomotive No. 602 to successfully complete the plan. From the 4th, the nine crew members who participated in the challenge specifically divided the work and began the maintenance work of the 602 locomotive. They climbed on and under the car tirelessly, even taking off their coats and climbing into the water tank to do cleaning work. The challenge locomotive is scheduled to leave the warehouse on the 12th of this month.

    【本报讯】长辛店、北平铁路职工为迎接“七一”，中国共产党二十八周年诞辰，普遍地掀起生产竞赛热潮。
    长辛店工务段首先于五月二十五日召开扩大段务会议，纷纷提出竞赛条件，并向平津区各工务段挑战。桥梁、养路、建筑各方面，拟出具体计划，争取提前完成任务，加作工程，并保证责任内的工作圆满完善。同时决定全体职工，进行搜集沿线之铁路器材；员工所住各村所存之器材，无论远近，不要公家化运费，一律自己搬运搜集。
    长辛店机厂车架厂准备于“七一”前，在工作时间外，不要加班费，赶修两台车架。电修厂工人为迎接“七一”，现在正研究改造五个发电机。电务段于五月二十八日举行全体职工大会，大家认为：要好好保护交换台并保证电讯设备不出障碍，电力照常供应；在工作时间外，拆除交换台木栏墙，利用旧砖筑墙。机务段则决定：在工作时间外，不要加班费，不占用甲检台，使一辆旧机车复活。
    北平机务段车房全体职工五月三十日开会，决定在经常工作外，修一台“全国解放号”机车，作为向中国共产党生日“七一”的献礼。修理北平“五一”号机车的劳动模范赵明说：要用完成“五一”号的精神，来完成“全国解放号”的修理。锅炉、电机、铆工等工人保证早日完成其修理工作，争取六月二十日以前该机车即可出厂；出厂后，并保证在三个月内，安全行走四万公里（超过一般较好机车三万公里的标准），且保持机车永远清洁。
    北平检车段全体职工，则要在工作之外装修一列“七一”号客车作为给中共诞辰的献礼。六月三日全体工人开会，讨论完成工作的五项具体办法和标准：一、材料尽量利用废料和代用品，以刻苦兴家的精神，来克服各种困难。二、树立团结互助作风，分工互助，使各部门都能完成任务，建立整体观念。三、领导方面及时检查帮助，进行适当的表扬和鼓励。四、采取各部门竞赛办法，工作要做得好，做得快。五、列车抢修后，保证够机厂检修标准。
    【唐山电】在东北海拉尔机务段八八四号机车安全行走十一万公里光荣事迹鼓舞下，唐山机务段全体工人向全华北铁路机务段提出：以安全行走四万公里并突破一个甲检期（每甲检期为四万公里）的条件进行挑战，作为该段全体工人献给“七一”节的贺礼。本月二日乘务员会议上全体工人热烈讨论后，决定以六零二号机车为代表，由吴敏春等九名乘务员驾驶，规定了具体的挑战条件，如：安全行走四万公里，突破八万公里行程后甲检（即突破一个甲检期），包作日常及定期的检查与修缮，包作日常及定检给油，自作洗炉工作，提高洗炉后的行走公里，及保证不误工、不漏乘、不请假，保证机车日常清洁及良好状态，遵守负责制的劳动纪律，机车在外段除锅炉风闸部等间接工作外，其余修缮工作一律由乘务员负责，节约煤炭、油料，减少消耗量等。该段全体工友认为这是唐山机务段的光荣，一定要支持六零二号机车胜利完成计划。从四日起参加挑战的九名乘务员具体分了工，开始了六零二机车的检修工作。他们不顾疲劳地爬在车上、车下的忙碌着，甚至脱下外衣爬入水柜作清理工作，挑战机车准备在本月十二日出库行驶。
