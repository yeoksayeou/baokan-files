　　China's First!
　　Mining and Metallurgical Research Institute Successfully Trial-Produces Refractory Porcelain
　　[Xinhua News Agency, Beiping, 3rd] The Refractory Porcelain trial-produced by the Mining and Metallurgical Research Institute under the Enterprise Department of the North China People's Government has been a success. This is the first time China has independently produced refractory porcelain. The finished products from the kiln include over 300 items such as combustion boats, crucibles, and evaporating dishes, with heat resistance and acid resistance properties superior to any imported products. The initial experiments of the Institute's refractory porcelain in the laboratory were completed as early as September last year, but were forced to stop due to the lack of assistance from the Kuomintang government. After the liberation of Tianjin, the People's Government took over the Institute and provided active support for the Institute's refractory porcelain experiments, which finally succeeded smoothly. This experiment started on May 25th and the kiln was opened on the 1st of this month. The four technicians participating in the experiment took turns on duty to watch the kiln carefully, observing the temperature inside the kiln. Each shift lasted for 24 hours continuously, being diligent and responsible. Now, Tianjin Steel Plant and Peking University Laboratory have contacted the Institute to order its products.

　　我国第一次！
  　矿冶研究所试制耐火磁器已成功
    【新华社北平三日电】华北人民政府企业部所属矿冶研究所耐火磁器试制成功。这是我国第一次自制耐火磁器。出窑成品包括燃烧船、坩锅、蒸发皿等共三百余件，其耐热、耐酸性能均较任何舶来品优良。该所耐火磁器在实验室内的初步试验早已于去年九月完成，当时因国民党政府不予帮助，致被迫停止。天津解放后，人民政府接管该所，对该所耐火磁器的试验当予以积极支持，此次终于顺利成功。此次试验是从五月二十五日开始，至本月一日出窑。烧制期间参加试验的四位技师，轮流值班守窑，细心注视窑内温度，每班连续二十四小时之久，辛勤负责。现在天津炼钢厂及北大实验室等都已与该所接洽，定购该所出品。
