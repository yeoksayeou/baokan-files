　　Peng Zhengang is a soldier in the Fifth Company of the 607th Regiment. He has been in the army for five years and is only twenty-two years old this year.
　　He has a concern that has become a serious ideological burden: that is, he has fought as many battles as anyone else, but he has never received a major award. What makes him most sad is that he is not yet a Party member. Originally, when preparing to attack Beiping, he was full of energy and determined to make a great contribution, and asked the organization to examine whether he met the requirements for joining the Party; but soon Beiping was peacefully resolved, which completely frustrated his plans, and he hated himself even more for not being promising in the past. He was listless and unhappy all day long. Those who didn't know the details thought he was having "family thoughts," but he didn't want to reveal his secret...
　　"Fight to Taiyuan!..." The slogan erupted like a volcano. The troops began their great march towards Taiyuan. Peng Zhengang didn't know where so much "emotion" came from, and he completely transformed from his previous self, jumping around all day long. During the march, the battalion held a military meeting to mobilize for the attack on Taiyuan. He was the first to jump up and say: "I request the leadership to allow me to be the tip of the spear (the first assault soldier). I will resolutely complete the task and guarantee that I will not leave the front line even with serious injuries..." Later, the battalion approved him to be the leader of the first assault team, and his joy almost drove him crazy, and he couldn't even sleep peacefully.

　　At dawn on April 20th, fierce artillery fire rang out around Taiyuan, and the outer sweep began. The Fifth Company was ordered to seize Zhaodao峪 north of the city. Peng Zhengang led the assault team first, puffing and puffing, stepping over the ditch north of the village, and plunged straight into the village, braving the stream of bullets passing overhead. With concealed and rapid movements, they inserted themselves to a sentry post next to the railway on the south side of the village. Peng Zhengang was like a nimble monkey, slipped to the entrance of the sentry post, and shouted to the enemy inside: "Surrender quickly! If you don't surrender, the flying mine will explode..." Seeing that the situation was hopeless, the enemy had no choice but to obediently become prisoners. They turned around and headed for the northeast corner of the village. Although the enemy inside shouted, "Surrender... surrender..." they delayed surrendering. Peng Zhengang had an impatient temper. He leaped in, and the enemy inside the sentry post was cooking. He seemed to pop out of the ground, pointing his submachine gun at the enemy's chest, and shouted: "Dare to move... move and you're all done for!" The frightened enemy, raising their hands, stammered out of the sentry post with trembling lips. Peng Zhengang's three-man assault team captured two light machine guns, eight rifles, two small cannons, took two sentry posts, and captured seven enemies alive. They chased after two more villages in a row, but they were either surrounded or resolved by friendly forces. Peng Zhengang said unhappily: "It's really like a tiger eating grasshoppers, not satisfying at all."

　　On the night of the 23rd, Instructor Su ordered Peng Zhengang and Zhao Shuangquan on the spot in the trenches to reconnoiter the depth of the moat. How urgent the matter was! The troops were about to launch a general attack tomorrow. Obviously, this task was only allowed to be completed, not allowed to fail. Although the departure point was only two hundred meters away from the moat, the dying enemy relied on the solid fortifications on the city wall to prevent our attack. Layers of gun holes and the flanking fire of the city wall's protrusions, as well as the plum blossom bunkers on the east side and the dark fortresses on the river bank, constituted a tight fire net. Illumination flares were fired one after another, illuminating the night as if it were daytime... As soon as they left an independent house, the enemy fired dozens of cannons in a row, and the house immediately turned into ruins. They moved forward regardless, and the shuttling streams of bullets drew ten thousand golden threads. The bullets landed next to them with a "poof" sound, and the dust kicked up by the shells turned them into mud men. What a dangerous situation this was! But for these steel-like warriors, what was triggered was not fear, but the flames of anger, courage, and determination! He knew deeply that the task he was undertaking was very serious. As soon as he stopped, the scene of the leaders eagerly waiting for the reconnaissance report to decide the assault route flashed in his mind, and then an unstoppable force was emitted. ...Under the enemy's "sea of fire", they rolled and crawled, from one crater to another, all the way to the edge of the moat. When the illumination flare was bright, because the enemy was only a dozen steps away across the river. They couldn't look up. They used the remaining light of the first illumination flare that was about to fall and the gap before the second illumination flare was released to see the dark grass bottom in the river clearly, and then they could know that wading across was not a problem. The task of reconnaissance was successfully completed.

　　The 24th was the day the People's Liberation Army began its general offensive against Taiyuan, and it was also the last day to end Yan Xishan's bloody rule over Shanxi.
　　In the morning light, the soldiers' hearts were beating nervously, eagerly waiting for the general attack order. Here, it was only one hundred and fifty meters away from the city wall. Peng Zhengang jumped up in the battle ditch and said to the whole group: "None of us should be cowards. If I don't rush to the front, you can shoot me!" The members of the assault team also jumped and shouted: "We will never be slackers!" When they saw several wounded soldiers from the Fourth Company, they enthusiastically shouted: "We are going to avenge them!" Everyone responded: "Yes!" Rumble... Boom... Our cannons began to "speak" to the enemy, and the troops began to charge. Peng Zhengang tucked seven grenades and two flying mines, strapped on his submachine gun, carried a large guillotine knife, jumped out of the battle trench, and rushed up like an arrow. He ran faster than anyone else, rushed to the small ditch by the moat in one breath, and lay down. A bullet grazed his spine, tearing a hole in his clothes. Liu Yu behind him immediately fell to the ground and did not move. ...The dying enemy desperately concentrated their artillery fire and poured it down like scrap iron. In an area of only forty meters north-south and twenty meters east-west, two hundred shells fell. This was truly a war of iron and fire! At this time, only Peng Zhengang was left there, holding on alone. He opened the caps of the grenades, readied his submachine gun, and angrily cursed the enemy: "I'm going to fight you to the death. I can't retreat an inch even if I die here!" The artillery fire from both sides was like overturning rivers and seas, and the sound of the cannons shook the earth. The smoke covered the sky, making it impossible to tell whether it was cloudy or sunny. The smell of gunpowder made you feel like the land was scorched...
　　In an instant, our superior artillery fire blasted several gaps in the city wall, and our troops charged. At this extremely tense moment, a ruthless enemy shell exploded where Peng Zhengang was, and a cloud of black smoke rose with dust. Peng Zhengang's shadow disappeared, and the advancing soldiers said worriedly: "It's bad... it's bad! Comrade Peng Zhengang has been sacrificed!" Wang Zhenxing, the communication soldier of the company headquarters, hurriedly ran up and saw that Peng Zhengang was buried in the soil, with only his head exposed, his face as purple as an eggplant, and he couldn't say a word. He hurriedly used a shovel to dig the soil away. Peng Zhengang climbed out and saw that the troops were charging towards the city. He嗖 and chased after them. He climbed the city wall and the soldier Su Wanfu also caught up. The two of them followed the city wall to the west. The enemy in the fortifications on the city wall was cowering in the caves, afraid to raise their heads due to the fire of our cannons, and just threw many un-capped grenades down blindly. When the enemy found that Peng Zhengang was blocking the fortifications with his submachine gun, they had no choice but to surrender one by one. Peng Zhengang and Su Wanfu thus ferreted out more than one hundred and twenty enemies in the fortifications, one of whom was a prisoner dressed as an officer who wanted to give his watch to Peng Zhengang. He rebuked: "The People's Liberation Army doesn't want this!" That guy quietly took it back. After handing over the prisoners to the troops who came up, Peng Zhengang immediately ran down the city wall and rushed south along the street. Peng Zhengang met two more soldiers from his company. He said: "Follow me! Let's stick together and not lose contact." The four of them formed a temporary combat team on the battlefield and kept plugging into the enemy. The four soldiers turned east and encountered a large enemy bunker. Peng Zhengang immediately directed the entire team to conceal and surround the enemy. He pounced like a tiger and shouted: "Surrender and be treated leniently, don't sell your lives for Yan's bandits!" Twenty-five enemies surrendered. In the case of losing contact with the company, Peng Zhengang's one-handedly formed combat team captured more than one hundred and fifty enemies from the beginning of the charge to the end of the entire battle.

　　"The bell is in the temple, but the sound is outside." Peng Zhengang's name resounded throughout the entire regiment, and the soldiers discussed one after another, saying: "He is really a lone hero!" At the merit evaluation meeting after the Taiyuan Campaign, the masses unanimously agreed to award him a major award. From then on, he became a great hero of the people. Peng Zhengang proved in multiple battle tests that he was infinitely loyal to the cause of the people. The branch believed that he had met the requirements for joining the Party, and with the approval of the battalion committee, he gloriously joined the Communist Party. At the same time, because he was not only brave in individual combat but also had command ability, the regiment ordered him to be promoted to deputy platoon leader. So, when officers and soldiers met Peng Zhengang, they greeted him kindly: "You really have triple happiness coming at once!"

　　彭振刚三喜齐来
    孙铁
　　（一）
    彭振刚是六○七团五连的战士，参加队伍五年了，今年才二十二岁。
    他有一桩心事，已成了一个严重的思想负担：就是自己比谁打仗也不少，但总没立过大功。最使他难过的自己还不是个党员。本来在准备攻打北平时，劲蹩的嘣嘣的，抱定了决心立个大功，并要求组织上考查自己够不够入党条件；可是不久北平和平解决了，使他心里的计划完全落空，从此更加恨怨自己从前没出息了。他一天价没精打采不高兴，不知底细的人，认为他在闹“家庭观念”，可是他的秘密总不愿说出口……
    “打到太原去！……”口号象火山爆裂似的迸发出来，部队开始了向太原的大进军，彭振刚不知从那里来了这么多“情绪”，完全和以前变成了两个人，一天价活蹦乱跳的，在行军中，营里召开军人大会动员打太原，他第一个跳起来说：“要求上级准许我当尖刀尖（第一突击战士），我坚决完成任务，保证重伤不下火线……”后来营里批准他当第一突击组长，他那股高兴劲简直使他发狂，连觉都睡不安生了。
    （二）
    四月二十日的拂晓，太原四周响起了激烈的炮火，外围扫荡战开始了。五连奉命夺取城北的赵道峪，彭振刚头一个带着突击组，噗嗤噗嗤的踏过村北的河沟，冒着掠过头顶的弹流一直向村内猛插。他们以荫蔽神速的动作，插到村南铁道边的一个岗楼跟前，彭振刚就象一只灵巧的猴子，一下溜到了岗楼入口，向里边的敌人大喊：“快缴吧！不缴枪飞雷就响了……”敌人见大势已去，只好驯服的当了俘虏。他们转身又向村东北角岗楼插去，里边敌人虽然喊着：“缴枪……缴枪……”可是总拖延不缴，彭振刚是个急性子脾气，一纵身攒进去，岗楼里面的敌人正在做饭，他象地里冒出来似的，把冲锋枪逼住了敌人的胸口，大声喝道：“敢动……动全嘟嘟了你们！”吓得丢魂失魄的敌人，举着双手，嘴唇哆嗦着攒出了岗楼。彭振刚这个三人组成的突击组，缴获了两挺轻机枪、八支步枪、两门小炮，拿下了两座岗楼，活捉了七个敌人。他们又一连追了两个村，那里不是被友军包围就是被解决，彭振刚不高兴的说：“真他妈老虎吃蚂蚱不过瘾”。
    （三）
    二十三日夜，苏教导员在战壕里，当场命令彭振刚和赵双全去侦察护城河水深的情形。事情是多么紧迫呀！明天部队就要开始总攻击，很明显这个任务是只许完成不许完不成的。出发地离护城河虽不过二百米，但是垂死的敌人为了阻止我们进攻倚靠着城墙上的坚固工事，层层的枪眼和城墙突出部的侧射火力及东面的梅花碉和河岸的暗堡构成严密的火网，一颗接一颗的照明弹把黑夜照得如同白昼……他们刚离开一处独立家屋，敌人便连发数十炮，房屋便立刻变成了废墟，他们不顾一切的向前挪动着，穿梭不息的弹流划出万条金线，弹头噗噗的落在他们身边，炮弹掀起的尘土把他们变成了泥人，这是多么危险的情况呀！但是对于这钢铁般的战士引起的不是恐惧，而是愤怒的火焰、勇敢与坚定！他深深知道自己所担负的任务是十分严重的，稍一停止，首长们迫切等待侦察报告，好决定突击道路的情景就在脑子里闪过，于是就发出一股不可遏止的力量。…他们在敌人的“火海”下，滚着、爬着，从这一个弹坑翻到那一个弹坑，一直到护城河边。当照明弹正亮的时候，因为相隔十几步远河的对岸就是敌人。他们是不能抬头的，他们利用了第一颗照明弹快落的余光，第二颗照明弹尚未放出的空隙，看清河里黑乎乎的草底，于是可以知道徒涉是不成问题的。侦察地形的任务是胜利的达成了任务。
    （四）
    廿四日，是解放军开始向太原发动总攻的一天，也是结束阎锡山血腥统治山西的最后一天。
    在晨光中，战士们的心紧张的跳着，急待着总攻号令。这里离城墙只有一百五十公尺。彭振刚在战沟里蹦起来对全组说：“咱们谁也不要当孬种，我要不冲在最前头，你们枪毙我！”突击组员们也跳着喊：“我们决不落个松包！”他们见到四连几个伤员便热情的喊出：“我们要为他们报仇去呀！”大家都应：“对！”轰隆…轰…我们的大炮开始向敌人“发言”了，部队开始了冲锋，彭振刚掖着七个手榴弹两个飞雷，挎好冲锋枪，扛着大铡刀，跳出战壕箭一样的冲上去了，他比谁也跑的快，一气跑到护城河边小沟往下一伏，一颗子弹从他的脊梁骨上面擦过去，把衣服穿了一道口子，背后的刘玉立刻跌倒地下不动了。……垂死挣扎的敌人拼命集中炮火象废铁似的倾泻着，仅在一块南北四十公尺、东西二十公尺的地带上，足足落了二百发炮弹，这真是铁与火的战争啊！这时只剩下彭振刚一人在那里孤守着，他把手榴弹掀开盖，冲锋枪做好了预备放，愤怒的骂着敌人：“老子和你们拚了，死在这里也不能后退一寸！”双方的炮火有如翻江倒海之势，炮声把大地震动得摇撼起来，硝烟笼罩了天空，使人分辨不出阴天还是晴天，火药的气息简直使你感到土地都烧焦了……
    一刹那我优势的炮火把城墙轰开几道缺口，我们部队冲锋了。正在这万分紧张的时候，敌人一颗无情的炮弹在彭振刚在的地方爆炸了，一团黑烟伴着尘土飞起，再不见彭振刚的影子，前进的战士们担心的说：“坏了…坏了！彭振刚同志牺牲了！”连部的通信员王振兴急忙跑上去，只见彭振刚被埋在土里，光露着脑袋、脸蹩得象个紫茄子，一句话也说不出，忙用铣把土扬开。彭振刚爬出来一看部队正往城上冲，他嗖的就追上去了。他登上城头战士粟万福也赶上来，他俩就顺着城墙往西摸。城上工事的敌人被我炮火打得龟缩在洞里不敢抬头，只是把许多没掀盖的手榴弹往下瞎扔，当敌人发觉彭振刚端着冲锋枪堵住工事上时，只好一个个俯首就擒了。彭振刚、粟万福就这样在工事里掏出一百二十多个敌人，其中一个军官打扮的俘虏要把手表送给彭振刚，他喝斥道：“解放军不要这个！”那个家伙又悄悄的收了回去。把俘虏交了给上来的队伍后，彭振刚立刻跑下城墙顺着街向南冲了，彭振刚又碰上了两个本连的战士，他说：“跟我走！咱们裱在一起，不要失掉联络。”他们四个人在战场上临时结成了一个战斗小组，一直向敌人插去。四个战士向东一拐，遇上敌人一个大碉堡，彭振刚马上指挥全组荫蔽包围敌人，他象只猛虎扑上去大喊：“缴枪宽大，不要给阎匪卖命！”二十五个敌人缴了枪。在与连失掉联系的情况下，彭振刚这个一手组成的战斗小组，从冲锋开始到全部战斗结束，共俘敌百五十余名。
    （五）
    “钟在寺院音在外”，彭振刚的名子响遍了全团，战士们都纷纷议论说：“人家真算是个孤胆英雄！”太原战役后的评功会上，群众们一致赞成给他立一大功。从此他就成了人民的大功臣。彭振刚在多次战斗考验中，证明他对人民的事业是无限忠诚的，支部认为他已够了入党条件，经过营委的批准他光荣的参加了共产党了。同时因为不但个人作战勇敢，且有指挥能力，团命令提升他为副排长。于是干部战士碰上彭振刚，便亲切的招呼一句：“你真是三喜齐来呀！”
