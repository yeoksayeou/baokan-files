　　Waterproofing Project in Mentougou Mining Area
    [Ping City News] The Mentougou mining area has been mined for many years and has penetrated deep into the ground, increasing underground water. It floods every few years. In order to prevent flooding, the Mining Bureau held a Mentougou waterproofing meeting on the 6th to solicit opinions and experiences from all parties. It conducted on-site investigations together with Mentougou Mine, Xishan Mine, Chengzikou Mine, engineers, and small kiln operators to formulate specific waterproofing plans and organize three water control investigation teams to manage the project in three sections (West Section, East Section, Chengzicun Section) respectively. Technicians have now been dispatched to each team to guide, supervise, and inspect the various waterproofing projects. As the rainy season is approaching, this office plans to urge each team to complete the above water control project ahead of schedule.

　　门头沟矿区修防水工程
    【平市讯】门头沟矿区因开采年久，深入地内，地下水增大，每隔几年必淹一次。矿务处为了防淹，特于六日召开门头沟防水会议，征求各方意见及各方经验，会同门矿、西山矿、城子矿、工程师及小窑作头进行实地勘查拟定具体防水计划，并组织三个治水勘查小组，分三段（西段、东段、城子村段）分别治理。现已派技工到各组指导督促及检查各项防水工程工作。惟现已届雨季，本处拟督促各小组提前完成上项治水工程。
