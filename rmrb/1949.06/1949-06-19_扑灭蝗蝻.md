Eradicate Locust Nymphs
    Technical Improvement Division of the Ministry of Agriculture

    Currently, locusts have infested 39 counties, including 17 in the Taihang region, 11 in southern Hebei, 4 in eastern Hebei, 4 in central Hebei, 2 in Chahar, and 1 in the Hebei-Shandong-Henan region. Among these, the Taihang region has been continuously affected since February. Anyang eradicated them once, but they reappeared. Locusts have been found in over 400 villages across the county's ten districts. Cixian County has also discovered locust nymphs in 64 villages, with as many as 300 to 400 nymphs per square step. If the people in the affected areas had not actively captured and eliminated them, the spread would have been even more disastrous. The severe locust infestation is mainly due to the long-term rule of the enemy and puppets, which allowed locusts to breed and lay a large number of eggs year after year. Secondly, North China has natural conditions suitable for locust breeding, such as coastlines, alkaline wasteland, rivers, lakes, marshes, mountain slopes, barren land, and favorable climate and rainfall. In 1944, we mobilized over 800,000 people in 69 counties to successfully combat the locust plague, eliminating 19 million catties of locusts. However, due to the existence of enemy-occupied areas, the locusts were not completely eradicated. Today, with a stable environment, increased public awareness, and the added advantage of using scientific technology, we must not only "eradicate locusts wherever they occur and prevent locust plagues from forming," but also take further steps to eliminate the locust breeding grounds using various methods. The prevention and control measures are as follows:

    I. Organize and eradicate quickly.
    1. Digging up eggs: Locusts have a very strong reproductive capacity, with an average migratory locust laying 70 to 80 eggs. One catty of locust eggs can hatch more than 39,000 migratory locusts. In 1944, Taihang, central Hebei, and northern Yue regions dug up a total of 150,000 catties of eggs, which greatly reduced locusts. "Catching locusts is not as good as beating nymphs, and beating nymphs is not as good as digging up eggs." This is the most important and fundamental method for eradicating locusts, but it is often overlooked. Therefore, constant and careful organization is necessary to ensure its implementation. In the past, the reward system in Taihang and other places, such as exchanging one catty of eggs for one catty of rice, was very effective in promoting the persistence of this work. Locust eggs are similar in shape to wheat seeds, but slightly longer and more curved, with a reddish-brown color. Dozens or hundreds of eggs are clustered together, called egg masses, with a reticulated thin white membrane on top. Locust eggs are mostly laid in hard soil, under grass mats, or in stone crevices. In loose soil, they are buried deeper, generally about two fingers deep, and at most four fingers. The method of digging up eggs is, first, to find the places with the most locusts; second, to go to sunny slopes; third, to go to places with many dead locusts and locust droppings. At the laying site, finding a small hole thicker than a wheat straw, a slight brush can reveal the egg mass. With a strong dig, turn the soil block aside to expose the egg ingot. Dig step by step, dig once, pull horizontally once, pinch once. In plentiful times, you can dig more than two taels in ten minutes.

    2. Eliminating nymphs: Nymphs are divided into five instars. The first instar resembles ants, with an earth color. After molting, it becomes the second instar, dark brown. Every three to five days, it molts, and the body color gradually turns red. After the fifth molt, it grows wings and becomes a migratory locust. Large numbers of locust nymphs emerge from the soil and quickly spread over dozens, hundreds, or even dozens of miles, covering the ground, sometimes rolling into balls the size of steamed buns. If locust nymphs crawl into a dozen acres of crops, they will eat them all in the time it takes to smoke a pipe. Locust nymphs have particularly strong jumping ability, with the first instar being nine inches, the second instar one foot six inches, the third instar two feet two inches, the fourth instar two feet six inches, and the fifth instar three feet nine inches.

    Locust nymphs gather at the opening of the hole within two days of birth. If they can be quickly eradicated at this time, the effort is small and the effect is great. After three or four days, they will jump and scatter. The following methods can be used for capture:

    A. Ditch method: Dig ditches around the locust area or before the locust swarm migrates (width and depth depending on the area and nymph age) to block and drive the locust nymphs into the ditch to be eliminated.

    B. Encirclement method: If the area is very wide, it can be divided into small areas. Groups of nineteen people use cloth sheets laid on the ground to surround the area, driving the locusts onto the cloth and wrapping them up to kill them; or two people hold the cloth sheet in front, and the rest use branches to drive the locusts, waiting for the locust nymphs to crawl all over the cloth sheet, lifting it up and concentrating them for elimination; or dig a pit in the center of the encirclement and drive them in to kill them; or place dry grass in the center of the encirclement and drive the locust nymphs into the grass pile to burn them to death. Since nymphs are afraid of smoke, fire must be lit downwind first. When the fire is strong, quickly light the fire from all sides and block the fire pile so that the locust nymphs cannot escape.

    C. Poisoning method:
    (A) Mix two taels of sodium fluorosilicate, one catty of wheat bran, one catty of water, and a little brown sugar thoroughly and evenly. Scatter it on the locust nymphs before they move in the evening or early morning, using five to eight catties per mu.
    (B) Alternatively, mix one part of sodium fluorosilicate, one part of wheat bran, and 75 parts of water to form a medicinal solution, and spray it on the grass or reeds where the locust nymphs are (do not spray on crops, as it may cause phytotoxicity), so that the insects eat it and die from poisoning (experiments by the North China Agricultural Science Institute have been quite effective).
    (C) Or mix three parts of sodium arsenite, six parts of salt, one hundred parts of dry horse manure or wheat bran, and one hundred parts of water thoroughly and evenly. Spread it on the locust swarm before it moves in the evening or early morning to poison them.

    3. Beating Migratory Locusts: When locusts come, they come in dozens or hundreds of miles. In severe areas, they fly in the sky, covering the sky and the sun. Once they land, they cover several mountains and several gullies, making it impossible to see the ground. The only way is to quickly mobilize the masses to capture and beat them (poisoning with chemicals is only more effective when the initial area is small or when eliminating the remaining ones after beating). Migratory locusts are not like locust nymphs, flying when they want to fly and landing when they want to land, coming and going suddenly, making it difficult to catch them. However, locusts have five fears, six joys, and three impossibilities (five fears - cold, heat, humidity, smoke, and loud noises; six joys - being in groups, being downwind, flying in the sunlight or moonlight, migrating, mating at noon, and eating gramineous plants; three impossibilities - not being able to see horizontally, not being able to take off from soft grass, and not eating leguminous plants). Therefore, locust beating should be carried out in the morning, evening, and at night. As long as it is well organized, locust beating will not delay production. In the past few years, we have created many tactics and methods for locust beating, such as combining mobile warfare and guerrilla warfare, which can completely eliminate locusts. It is advisable to establish a defense zone. When migratory locusts are in the sky, beat gongs, drums, steel basins, strike bells, release smoke, so that locusts rotate in the air, cannot land, increase fatigue, such as releasing smoke can make migratory locusts lose their way, turn around in the smoke and cannot rush out, even if they rush out and fall to the ground, they cannot move for a long time, and are extremely easy to capture. In addition, sentries are set up to monitor migratory locusts in shifts, and there are local guns and cannons to connect. As soon as migratory locusts land, the locust exterminators can swarm from all directions. Give the migratory locusts a surprise attack, and then we use guerrilla nets to beat them as they come. There are many experiences and methods of beating, such as using the sieve circle formation, dustpan formation, long snake formation, all-sky star tactics, torch tactics, bell tactics, etc., to bury the locusts in the fire, bury them in the pit, and beat them on the ground. There are also those who use bag collection to capture them, and those who use water to drown them. In short, various methods must be taken to eliminate the locusts cleanly. Locust extermination is a very large organizational work, and the leading organs of various places should preside over it personally, such as setting up locust extermination headquarters in districts, and locust extermination command posts in counties, etc., in order to grasp the changes in the locust situation, command locust beating, summarize experience, organize people from non-locust areas to support locust areas, and directly lead the locust beating struggle in areas with serious locust plagues. In order to take care of physical strength and facilitate command, the masses themselves should be organized into elderly teams, youth teams, women's teams, and children's teams according to age and gender. When carrying out locust beating, they should be divided into egg digging teams, shovel teams, cloth bag teams, grass cutting teams, burning teams, commando teams, night battle teams, intelligence teams, and guard teams according to the locust situation. These experiences and methods can be flexibly applied according to local conditions.

    II. Eliminate locust breeding grounds.
    This is a long-term, fundamental task, which should be started this year. According to current understanding, there are six locust breeding grounds in North China, and locusts have emerged in these areas one after another this year: The first is the Anyang, Tangyin, and Cixian area. Due to the long-term rule of the enemy and puppets, and the proximity to the Fushui River and many barren mountain slopes; the second is the Xiuwu and Huojia area, between the Qin and Wei Rivers, which floods every year and has become a historical locust breeding ground; the third is the Tianjin Ninghe area in the Tianjin-Gu District, where rivers converge and there is a lot of alkaline wasteland; the fourth is the Baiyangdian area, where rivers converge and reeds grow densely; the fifth is the Ningjin Lake and Dalu Ze area, where rivers converge and there is a lot of coastal alkaline wasteland; the sixth is the Xingtai and Lingshou area, which is the upper reaches of the Hutuo River, Ci River, and Sha River, with many mountain ridges and barren slopes, such as the famous Grasshopper Mountain in Quyang (locusts occur every year in the mountain depressions). In order to completely eliminate locust plagues, permanent locust extermination teams should be established in each locust breeding ground, given specialized training, and various methods should be taken to eliminate these locust breeding grounds. Their task is to organize the masses to thoroughly dig up eggs, carry medicine and equipment, organize the necessary mass forces to eliminate the remaining locusts, so that eggs do not become nymphs, and nymphs do not become locusts. And investigate the area, occurrence time, location, soil quality and crop types of the locust area, and the number of past occurrences, implement winter plowing and land reclamation, and change the environment of the occurrence area, in order to completely eliminate the locust breeding grounds.

　　扑灭蝗蝻
    农业部技术改进处
    目前蝗虫发生已达三十九县，计太行十七县，冀南十一县，冀东四县，冀中四县，察哈尔二县，冀鲁豫一县；其中太行从二月份至今即不断发生，安阳消灭了一次，又复发生，全县十个区四百余村，都曾发生过，磁县也有六十四村发现蝗蝻，每方步多至三百个至四百个。如果不是在发生的地区人民积极捕打消灭，蔓延起来，更不得了。蝗虫发生这样严重，主要原因由于敌伪长期统治，蝗虫连年发生产下大量的蝗卵；其次由于华北有沿海、碱荒、河流、湖沼、山坡、荒地及气候雨量等，适合于蝗虫繁殖的自然条件。一九四四年在六十九县内我们曾经连续动员了八十余万人战胜了蝗灾，消灭蝗虫一千九百万斤。但是由于敌占区的存在，并没有把蝗虫彻底消灭。今天环境安定，人民的觉悟更加提高，并且又增加上一个使用科学技术的条件，因此不仅要做到“发生在哪里消灭到哪里，不使蝗害成灾”，而且更进一步要以各种办法消灭蝗虫发源地。其防治办法：
    一、组织起来迅速扑灭。
    １、刨卵——蝗虫的繁殖力很强，平均一个飞蝗可以产卵七八十个。一斤蝗卵可以孵化三万九千多飞蝗。一九四四年，太行、冀中、北岳三地共刨卵十五万斤，曾使蝗虫大为减少。“捕蝗不如打蝻，打蝻不如刨卵”这是扑灭蝗虫的一个最重要最根本的办法，但往往不被人重视，因此须要有经常的细心的组织工作来保证，过去太行等地刨一斤卵换一斤米之类的奖励办法，很起作用，能够促使这一工作坚持到底。蝗卵的形状和麦种相似，不过略长略弯一些，呈赭色，每数十个或数百个卵子，聚在一块，称为卵块，上有网状形的细白膜，蝗卵多产于硬地中，草盘下，或石头缝里，土松的地方入土较深，一般二指左右最深的不过四指。刨卵的办法，第一要到蝗虫顶多的地方去找，第二到阳坡去找，第三到死蝗和蝗粪多的地方去找，在产卵处发现比麦秸粗一点的小孔，稍一扑拉，就可发现卵块，用力一刨，将土块摆开，就露出卵锭来，按步就班往前刨，刨一下，横拉一下，捏一捏，多的时候十几分钟就可刨二两多。
    ２、除蝻：蝻子分为五龄。第一龄似蚂蚁，土色。蜕皮后为第二龄，黑褐色。每隔三五天蜕一次皮，体色渐红。第五次脱皮生翅膀，变成飞蝗。蝗蝻大批出土，很快就蔓延几十亩、几百亩，甚至几十里几百里一大片，盖满地皮，有时滚成馍馍大的团团。十几亩庄稼蝗蝻爬进去，抽一袋烟功夫就吃光了。蝗蝻跳跃力特别强，第一龄为九寸，第二龄一尺六寸，第三龄二尺二寸，第四龄二尺六寸，第五龄三尺九寸。
    蝗蝻初生历二日内团聚穴口，这时如能迅速扑灭，用力小而收效很大，三四日后即奔跳四散，捕打可采取如下几种办法：
    Ａ掘沟法：在蝗地四周或蝗群迁移之前掘沟（宽、深、视面积蝗龄而定）封锁，将蝗蝻驱入沟内歼灭。
    Ｂ围打法；如果地区很广，可以划分小区，十九个人一组，用布单子铺在地上，四周包围，将蝗虫赶到布上包起杀灭；或者两个人在前头掌握布单，其余的人用树枝驱赶，待蝗蝻爬满布单，提起集中消灭；或在包围圈中央刨坑，驱入杀死；或在包围圈中央放置干草，将蝗蝻驱入草堆里烧死。惟蝻子怕烟，须先在下风点火，火旺时再由四周迅速点火，并封锁火堆使蝗蝻无法逃出。
    Ｃ毒杀法：甲：以氟矽酸钠二两，麦麸一斤，水一斤，黑糖少许，充分搅拌和匀，于傍晚或清早撒布于蝗蝻移动之前，每亩用量五斤至八斤。或用氟矽酸钠一份，麦麸一份和水七十五份，配成药液，喷于蝗蝻之草地上或芦苇上（不可喷于作物上，因有药害），使虫食入中毒而死（华北农业科学研究所试验颇收成效）。或以亚砒酸钠三份，食盐六份，干马粪或麦麸一百份，水一百份，充分搅拌和匀，于傍晚或清早布于蝗群移动之撒前。予以毒杀。
    ３、打飞蝗：蝗虫一来就是几十里几百里，严重的地方飞在天空，遮天盖日，一落地就是几座山几道沟，使人看不见地皮，唯一的办法就是迅速发动群众捕打（药剂毒杀只在开始面积较小时或打后歼灭残余时比较有效）。飞蝗不象蝗蝻一样，说飞都飞，说落都落，忽来忽去，很难捉摸。但是蝗虫的特性有五怕六喜三不能（五怕——一冷，二热，三湿，四烟，五响声。六喜—一成群，二顺风，三在阳光月亮下飞翔，四转移，五中午交尾，六吃禾本科植物。三不能——不能平视，不能从软草上起飞，不吃豆类植物），因此打蝗要在早晨、傍晚及夜间进行，只要组织好，打蝗可以不耽误生产。几年来我们在打蝗中曾经创造了不少的战术及办法，如运动战和游击战相结合，可以将蝗虫歼灭干净，宜建立防御地带，飞蝗在天空时就打锣、打鼓、敲钢盆、撞钟、放烟、使蝗虫在空中旋转，不得落地，增加疲劳、如放烟可使飞蝗失迷方向，在烟雾中打转转冲不出去，即便冲出去落到地上很久不能动弹，极易捕打。另外再放出哨兵，分班轮流站岗监视飞蝗，并有土枪土炮连系，飞蝗一落地，剿蝗的就可以四面八方蜂拥而来。给飞蝗一个突然袭击，然后我们就用游击网随来随打。打的经验和办法是很多的，用箩圈阵，簸箕阵，长蛇阵，满天星战术，火把战术，响铃战术等，把蝗虫葬于火中，埋于坑中，打于地上。也有用袋集法捕捉的，也有用水淹的，总之要采取各种办法把蝗虫消灭干净。剿蝗是一个很大的组织工作，各地领导机关应亲自主持，如分区设剿蝗总部，县设剿蝗指挥部等，以掌握蝗情变化，指挥打蝗，总结经验，组织非蝗区群众支援蝗区，并直接领导蝗灾严重地区的打蝗斗争。群众本身的组织为了照顾体力强弱及指挥方便起见，应按年龄性别分为老年队、青年队、妇女队、儿童队；在进行打蝗时又根据蝗情分为刨卵队、锹镢队、布袋队、割草队、烧杀队、突击队、夜战队、情报队、警戒队等。这些经验办法，都可因地制宜，灵活运用。
    二、消灭蝗虫发源地。
    这是一个长期的治本工作，从今年起即应开始进行。据现在了解，在华北共有六块蝗虫发源地，今年蝗虫也是在这一带地方先后出土的：第一是安阳、汤阴、磁县一带。因长期敌伪统治，又加靠近滏河山坡荒地甚多；第二修武、获嘉一带，沁卫河间，每年泛滥，已成为历史上的蝗虫发源地；第三津沽区天津宁河一带，河流汇集，碱荒甚多；第四白洋淀一带河流汇集，芦苇丛生；第五宁晋泊、大陆泽一带，河流汇集沿海碱荒甚多。第六行唐、灵寿一带，为滹沱河、磁河、沙河上游，山岗荒坡甚多，如曲阳有一个有名的蚂蚱山（在山凹里年年发生蝗虫）。为了彻底消灭蝗害，在每一个蝗虫发源地，要建立经常的灭蝗队的组织，给以专门的训练，采取各种办法消灭这些蝗虫发源地，其任务是组织群众彻底刨卵，携带药械，组织必要的群众力量消灭残余蝗虫，使卵不成蝻，蝻不成蝗。并调查蝗虫地区面积发生时期，发生地点，土质与作物种类，及过去发生次数，实行冬耕垦荒，及改变发生地的环境，以彻底消灭蝗虫发源地。
