　　Introduction to Chinese History Tutorial
       Wu Yuzhang
　　III. Materials to be Selected for the Study of Chinese History (Continued)
    More than two thousand years ago in China, during the Spring and Autumn and Warring States periods in which Confucius and Mencius lived, commerce had already greatly developed, and the self-sufficient economy of small-scale agriculture combined with household industry should have been in the process of disintegration. Therefore, Confucius and Mencius at that time vigorously advocated the Kingly Way to seek restoration, opposing utilitarianism with abstract benevolence and righteousness. No one agreed with them, and their power could not reverse the wheels of historical progress. Their joy at the failure of the Kingly Way only indicated their ignorance of the times. Why couldn't China's commercial capital develop further? On the one hand, it was due to the difficulty in breaking down the combination of small-scale agriculture and household industry; on the other hand, it was because the accumulation of commercial capital flowed into the countryside in the form of usury capital (the Qin allowed people to buy and sell land) and failed to develop into large-scale industry. This is a major reason why China stagnated in the feudal stage up to modern times.
    Marx said:
    "The internal solidity and structure of pre-capitalist, tribal modes of production hinder the destructive power of commerce. This obstruction is clearly demonstrated in the relationship between the British and India and China. In China and India, the broad foundation of the method of production is the integration of small agriculture and domestic industry, and in India there is also the form of rural communes based on land village ownership, which used to be a primitive form in China. In India, the British, as rulers and land rent owners, immediately used their direct political power and economic power to destroy these small model economic village communities. Here, they eliminated the spinning and weaving industry with cheap goods, eliminated the long-standing components formed by this combination of industry and agriculture, and thus destroyed the rural communes. Only in this sense did they have a revolutionary impact on the method of production. However, even here, their destructive impact was only slowly effective. Their destructive impact in China was even less effective because the Chinese government did not help. In China, the direct combination of agriculture and handicraft industry greatly saves money and time, thus giving the most stubborn resistance to large-scale industrial products, because the price of large-scale industrial products includes the unproductive costs consumed everywhere in the circulation process of these products." ("Das Kapital," Russian edition, Volume III, Part One, page 299)
    Marx also said:
    "The unity of the primitive worker with the instruments and materials of production (here we will not talk about the relationship under the slavery system, under which the worker himself is one of the objective conditions of labor) has two main forms: the Asian rural commune (primitive communism) and various small-scale tribal agriculture (domestic industry combined with this agriculture). Both of these forms are primitive forms, and neither can be used to develop labor as social labor, nor can they be used to develop the productivity of social labor." (Marx, "Theories of Surplus Value," Russian edition, Volume III, page 308)
    From this, it can be seen that China's small-scale tribal agriculture, that is, the agricultural form combining domestic industry with this agriculture, is a remnant of primitive tribal society. They have strong isolationist characteristics. No matter how pure and good they are, they are always the solid foundation of Oriental despotism. They confine people's reason to the narrowest scope, turning reason into a docile tool of superstition, making it obey traditional conventions, preventing it from having any influence, and preventing it from striving for historical activities. Although it has also gone through the use of domestic slaves and feudal relations, transforming from slavery to serfdom, it has not been able to strengthen and develop production through slave labor and take the first step on the road of economic production.
　　IV. The Scope of Chinese History
    Our discussion of Chinese history should include the history of all ethnic groups in China. In fact, all old historical materials and long-standing habits have taken the history of the Han people as the history of China. Although the Mongols and Manchus, such as the Liao, Jin, Yuan, and Qing dynasties, have partial histories, they only record their royal families or facts related to the Han people, and there are many ethnic discriminatory prejudices. As for the history of the Hui, Tibetan, Miao, Yao, Fan, Man, Yi, and Li ethnic groups, it is almost completely absent. Now we should combine the histories of all ethnic groups to create the history of China. Although there are few materials and many difficulties in fact, we should work towards this goal.
　　V. The Chronological Records and Periodization of Chinese History
    In recent years, some Chinese history books written using new methods and some translated books of this kind have been published in China, among which there are many good works. However, most of them focus on the narration and debate of social development forms, and completely abandon the examples of Chinese old historical chronological records. This can only be regarded as a history of the development of Chinese social forms.
    We believe that history courses should narrate the most important events and facts and evaluate historical figures within the continuity of time. Abstract definitions of socio-economic forms should not be given to scholars, and abstract sociological formulas should not be used to replace the connected narration of civic history. Because history must have chronology, just as geography must have longitude and latitude, so that people can know the temporal position of events at a glance, which is useful. The old Chinese historian Zhang Taiyan also felt this. He said:
    "Mencius said that the traces of kings ceased and poetry disappeared, and after the disappearance of poetry, the Spring and Autumn Annals were created. The preface to the Book of Poetry says that if the Xiaoya are completely abandoned, then the four barbarians will invade and China will be in decline. The chronological recording of national history should begin from this point. Therefore, the Grand Historian's Records of the Twelve Lords begins with the Gonghe era, indicating that there were no chronological books before this." (Zhang's Series, "Guogu Lunheng" "Yuanjing" page 68)
    He also said:
    "The reason why the Spring and Autumn Annals are uniquely valued is that, before Confucius, the Book of Documents was broad and without years, and the records of the Spring and Autumn Annals of a hundred states were scattered and did not follow the usual examples... If Confucius had not arranged the Spring and Autumn Annals chronologically, even if one wanted to observe the era of Duke Ding and Duke Ai, to seek the traces of the Five Hegemons, it would still be vague and chaotic like the early days. To open the treasures of the golden chest and spread them to the common people, so that people would not forget the former kings, it began with Confucius and Zuo Qiuming." (Ibid.)
    He also praised the Spring and Autumn Annals, saying:
    "The classics and commentaries rely on each other, and the years and events are connected, so they are the masters of historical officials for a hundred generations." (Zhang's Series, "Jianlun" "Chunqiu Guyan" page 21)
    Since Sima Qian created the Records of the Grand Historian, changing the chronological order to biographies, the so-called Twenty-Four Histories of China mostly follow this example. Every person and every event can be fully seen in this, although it has the advantage of being complete, it inevitably creates separation from the connection of historical time as a whole. Therefore, Sima Guang created the Zizhi Tongjian, following the style of Zuo Qiuming's commentary on the Spring and Autumn Annals to create a chronology, continuing the example of the chronology of the Spring and Autumn Annals and Zuo Qiuming's commentary, starting with the Warring States period and ending with the Five Dynasties, and then the events of 1,362 years are arranged chronologically, as if pointing to the palm of one's hand. After this, there were many who continued to compile Tongjian following this example, which shows the value of chronology. Therefore, we must narrate Chinese history based on the materials of the Chinese old historical chronological records. Of course, this is not mechanically and rigidly narrating year by year, but rather attaching the year when necessary. The Republican era and the Western calendar era are used together for chronology.
    Regarding the issue of the periodization of Chinese history, Chinese historians have had many disputes and have not yet reached a conclusion. In order to be more scientific and handle this issue more appropriately, debate is possible and necessary. Now I would like to present my personal opinion for discussion among comrades who study history. I would like to divide the historical events of China's thousands of years into four major periods: ancient history, medieval history, near-modern history, and modern history.
    I. Ancient History—From the ancient times to the end of the Zhou Dynasty and the unification of the world by the Qin Dynasty (2132 years before the Republic of China, i.e., 221 BC). This is further divided into two periods:
    1 From the ancient times to the end of the Xia Dynasty. This is the period of myths and legends.
    2 From the Shang Dynasty to the unification of the world by the Qin Dynasty. This is a period with unearthed objects on the one hand and relatively reliable written records on the other.
    II. Medieval History—From the unification of the world by the Qin Dynasty to the end of the Five Dynasties and the pacification of the world by the Song Dynasty.
    2132 years before the Republic of China to 953 years
    221 BC to 959 AD
    III. Near-Modern History—From the pacification of the world by the Song Dynasty to the Opium War.
    953 years before the Republic of China to 72 years
    959 AD to 1840 AD
    IV. Modern History—Modern history is further divided into two periods.
    1 From the Opium War to the May Fourth (1919) Movement. Generally referred to as the period of the Old Democratic Revolution.
    72 years before the Republic of China to 8 years of the Republic of China
    1840 AD to 1919 AD
    2 From the May Fourth Movement to the present. Generally referred to as the period of the New Democratic Revolution.
    8 years of the Republic of China to the present
    1919 AD to the present

　　三、研究中国历史应选择的材料（续完）
    中国在二千多年前所谓春秋战国孔子孟子所处的时代，商业已有很大的发展，小农业与家庭工业合一的自足经济应该在瓦解的过程。所以孔孟当时力倡王道以谋复古，以抽象的仁义来反对功利，没有人去赞成他们，他们的力量也不能倒挽历史前进的车轮，徒欢王道之不行，这只是表示他们的不识时宜。为什么中国的商业资本不能向前发展呢？一方面由于小农业与家庭工业合一的不易破坏；另一方面由于商业资本之积累以高利贷资本的形式流入农村（秦使民得买卖土地）未能向大工业上去发展，这就使中国停滞在封建社会的阶段以至于现代的一个主要原因。
    马克思说：
    “资本主义以前的，氏族的生产方法，其内部的稳固和结构，使商业所具有的破坏力受到阻碍，这种阻碍在英国人同印度及中国的来往关系上表现得十分显明。在中国和印度，生产方法底广大基础就是小农业与家庭工业合成一体，而且在印度还有那种建立在土地村有制上面的农村公社底形式，这种形式过去在中国也是一种原始的形式。在印度，英国人以统治者和地租占有者底资格，立刻就使用了自己直接的政治权力和经济势力，以破坏这些小模范经济的村社。在这里，他们以廉价商品来消灭纺纱业和织布业，消灭这种工农业合一所形成的历来就有的组成部分，并这样来破坏农村公社，只是在这个意思上讲来，他们对于生产方法才有革命化的影响。可是就在这里，他们的这种破坏影响也只是很慢地才收到成效。他们这种破坏影响在中国所得的成效更少，因为中国本国的政权不来帮忙。在中国农业与手工工场业直接结合，这就大大节省钱财又节省时间，因此就给大工业生产品以最顽强的抵抗，因为大工业生产品的价格，是包括着这些生产品底流通过程中处处所耗去的不生产的费用。”（“资本论”，俄文版第三卷，第一部第二九九页）马克思又说：
    “原始时代的工作人与生产工具和资料的一体（这里姑且不讲奴隶制度下的关系，在奴隶制度之下，工作人本身就是劳动底客观条件之一）有两个主要形式：亚洲的农村公社（原始共产主义）以及各式各样的小规模的氏族的农业（家庭工业与此种农业相结合）。这两种形式都是原始的形式，都同样不能用来把劳动作为社会劳动来发展，且不能用来发展社会劳动底生产率。”（马克思著：“剩余价值论”，俄文版第三卷，三○八页）
    由此可见中国小规模的氏族的农业，即家庭工业与此种农业相结合的农业形式，是原始氏族社会底残余。他们有坚强的闭关自守性，无论其怎样纯良，他们始终是东方专制政体底稳固基础，他们使人的理智拘泥于最狭隘的范围内，把理智变成迷信底驯服工具，使他服从传统惯例，使它不发生什么影响，使它不能努力于历史上的活动。它虽然也经过家庭奴隶的使用和封建的关系，由奴隶制转化为农奴制，但他没有能够借奴隶劳动来加强并发展生产，开始经济生产道路上的第一步。
　　四、中国历史的范围
    我们讲中国历史应该是包括全中国各民族的历史，而事实上，所有的旧历史材料和历来的习惯，都以汉族的历史为中国的历史，蒙满各族如辽、金、元、清虽有部分的历史，而都只记载其皇室或与汉族有关的事实，并且存在着许多民族歧视的偏见。至于回，藏，苗，瑶，番，蛮，夷，黎各族的历史，几乎完全没有。现在我们应该把各民族的历史，合起来作成中国的历史。虽然材料很少，事实上有许多困难，但是，我们要照这个目的作去。
　　五、中国历史的编年纪事和时代的划分
    中国近年出了一些用新方法来著述的中国历史书籍和译出了一些这类书籍，其中有不少的良好作品。但是，大多数注重在社会发展形式的叙述与辩论，而把中国旧历史编年纪事的例子完全抛弃，这样就只能算是中国社会形式发展史。
    我们认为：历史课程，应当在年代的联系性中，叙述最重要的事变和事实及历史人物的评价。不能把社会经济形态底抽象的定义给学者，拿抽象的社会学的公式代替有联系性的叙述公民史。因为历史的必须有年代，犹如地理的必须有经纬线一样，使人一见编年，即能知道其事在时间上的时置，方有用处。中国旧史学家章太炎亦感觉到这一点。他说：
    “孟子曰王者之迹息而诗亡，诗亡然后春秋作。诗序曰小雅尽废则四夷交侵中国微矣，国史之有编年宜自此始。故太史公录十二诸侯年表始于共和，明前此无编年书。”（章氏丛书，国故论衡中“原经”六八页）他又说：
    “春秋所以独贵者，自仲尼以上，尚书则阔略无年次，百国春秋之志，复散乱不循凡例……令仲尼不次春秋，今虽欲观定哀之世，求五伯之迹，尚荒忽如草昧。夫发金匮之藏，被之萌庶，令人不忘前王，自仲尼左丘明始。”（同上）他又赞美春秋说：
    “经传相依，年事相系，故为百世史官宗主。”（章氏丛书，检论“春秋故言”二一页）
    自司马迁作史记改编年为传记，中国所谓二十四史多循其例，凡一人一事可于此具见其首尾，虽有一节之长，而于历史整个时间的联系上则不免隔阂，故司马光作资治通鉴，依左氏传体为编年，以继春秋左传编年之例，上起战国，下终五代，然后一千三百六十二年之事，编年系事，如指诸掌。此后彷其例而继续成通鉴者很多，于此可见编年的可贵。因此，我们必须根据中国旧史编年纪事的材料来叙述中国历史。自然这不是机械地，死板地按年叙述，而是于相当必要时附以纪年。纪年以民国纪元与西历纪元并用。
    关于中国历史的分期问题，我们中国历史家曾有许多争论，尚无定议，为了更合于科学，更妥当的处理这一问题，争论是可以而且是必要的。现在提出我个人的意见以供研究历史的同志们商讨，我想把中国几千年的历史事变分为上古史、中古史、近古史、近代史四大时期。
    一、上古史——从太古到周朝末年秦统一天下止（民国纪元前二一三二年即西历纪元前二二一年。）这中间又分为两个时期：
    １　从太古到夏朝末。这是神话传说的时期。
    ２　从商朝到秦统一天下，这是一方面有出土物，一方面有比较可靠的文字记载的时期。
    二、中古史——自秦统一天下到五代末年宋平定天下止。
    民国纪元前二一三二年到九五三年
    西历纪元前二二一年到西历九五九年
    三、近古史——自宋平定天下到鸦片战争止。
    民国纪元前九五三年到七十二年
    西历九五九年到一八四○年
    四、近代史——近代史又分为两个时期。
    １　自鸦片战争到“五四”（一九一九年）运动。总称为旧民主主义革命时期。
    民国纪元前七二年到民国八年
    西历一八四○年到一九一九年
    ２　自“五四”运动到现在。总称为新民主主义革命时期。
    民国八年到现在
    西历一九一九年到现在
