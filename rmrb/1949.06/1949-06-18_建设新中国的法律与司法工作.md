　　The Legal and Judicial Work of Building a New China

　　Since the Chinese people created their own armed forces and political power, they have begun their own legal construction. Although it is still very incomplete, the accumulated experience is quite rich.

　　From the very beginning, the Chinese people's revolutionary struggle replaced the old ruling class's laws with the laws of their own class. It has nothing to do with all old laws. For more than 20 years, in any liberated area, except for occasionally using a certain favorable enemy legal clause in the struggle against the enemy, it has never recognized or cited the old laws. The Kuomintang's Six Codes were not abolished after being explicitly ordered, but never existed in the liberated areas.

　　The Chinese people's judicial struggle with class enemies, regardless of the method adopted, is serious and lenient. Those who have done many evils and are hated by everyone must not escape punishment, while those who have not done much evil are allowed to rehabilitate themselves. Chiang Kai-shek's bandit gang treated the people with "rather kill three thousand by mistake than let one go," while the people treated the bandit gang with "the chief culprits must be punished, the accomplices are not investigated, and meritorious service is rewarded." The greatness of the people's demeanor is such.

　　As for general crimes, that is a disease left over from the old society. The people's society has eliminated and is eliminating the social roots of crime. Therefore, the purpose of punishing those who are still committing crimes is to transform them. The achievement reports of the re-education through labor centers in various liberated areas show that some criminals have become labor heroes and cadres. In some centers, criminals do not need guards, and after being released, they still maintain contact with the prison. This is how the people treat the healing of social wounds in the judicial aspect.

　　Secondly, the Chinese people's spirit of abiding by their own laws is amazing. They jointly fight against the enemy and participate in various constructions. Once a decision is made, they all abide by it. The Three Main Rules of Discipline and Eight Points for Attention of the People's Liberation Army, the labor discipline of workers, the rural conventions of farmers, and the implementation of orders from higher authorities cannot be achieved by coercion. It is because the broad masses of people have become the masters of society, knowing that the law is their own, and that the law is not harmful to their interests but precisely protects their interests. Their vision has become broader, and the life of order has gradually become accustomed to.

　　This unfolds a picture that is completely different from the old so-called "rule of law." Comrades who study law and do justice must focus on this point, so as not to be blinded by certain existing weaknesses and be able to grasp the essence of the people's law and serve the people's law.

　　The weaknesses in our law and judiciary are: due to the division of the war, the judicial systems and even the names of the liberated areas are different; in various specific regulations, the provisions for the same event often differ from place to place; some have only policies and guidelines, but no specific legal provisions, and it is inevitable to lose weight when judging cases based on them; in addition, there is a lack of judicial cadres, and deviations easily occur in understanding and implementing policies. It is obvious that at the time of national victory, everything requires unification, and the unification of legal and judicial systems is even more necessary; as various tasks enter the normal track, the laws that maintain various tasks must be gradually equipped. These weaknesses cannot be allowed to continue to exist.

　　Since the establishment of the North China People's Government, there has been some progress in judicial construction, and the newly established People's Courts in Tianjin and Beijing have also achieved great success, but it is still far from our expectations. In order to build the legal and judicial work of a new democratic China, the task is arduous. But we have the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, which combines the universal truth of Marxism with the concrete practice of the Chinese revolution, the experience of legal and judicial work in the liberated areas for more than 20 years, and the wisdom of the broad masses of people in creating and creating various laws. As long as we work hard, are good at grasping Mao Zedong Thought, and are good at combining with the people, the task is arduous but we will be happy to be competent.

### 建设新中国的法律与司法工作

　　建设新中国的法律与司法工作
    中国人民自从创立了自己的武装与政权的那天起，就开始了自己的法津建设，虽然还极不完全，但累积的经验，相当丰富。
    中国人民革命斗争，一开始就和旧统治阶级的法律斗争而代之以自己阶级的法律，他和一切旧法律无缘，二十多年来不论那个解放区，除和敌人斗争偶然利用某个有利的敌人法条外，从没承认过或援用过旧法律。国民党的六法全书，不是有明令后才废除，而是从来没有在解放区存在过。
    中国人民和阶级敌人作司法斗争，不论采取何种方式，都是严肃而又宽大的。作恶特多、人人痛恨的人，绝不能幸逃显戮，而对于为恶不多的人，则许其自新。蒋介石匪帮对于人民，是“宁错杀三千不肯放松一个”，而人民对于匪帮，则是首恶必诛，协从罔治，立功有赏。人民气度之伟大如此。
    至于一般犯罪，那是旧社会遗下的病。人民的社会已消除了与正消除着犯罪的社会根源，因而对尚在犯罪的人，处罚目的，在于改造。各解放区自新习艺所的成绩报告，有由犯人而成为劳动英雄成为干部的，有的临所，犯人不用看守，释放出去还经常和监所有联系。人民对医治社会疮伤之表现于司法方面者是如此。
    其次，中国人民遵守自己法律的精神是惊人的，他们共同和敌人斗争及参加各种建设，一有决定，无不恪守。人民解放军的三大纪律八项注意，工人的劳动纪律，农民们的农村公约，及执行上级法令，都不是靠强迫所能做到，而是广大人民做了社会主人，知道法律是自己的，法律不是有害于自己的利益而正是保护自己的利益，他们眼光已远大了，秩序的生活已渐惯了。
    这就展开了和旧的所谓“法治”全然不同的图画。研究法律与做司法的同志，必须于此着眼，才不为现存的某些弱点所蒙蔽而能把握住人民的法的实质，以为人民的法服务。
    我们法律与司法上存在的弱点，如：由于战争的分割，各解放区的司法制度甚至名称都不一样；各种单行条例，同一事件，各地规定常有出入；有些则只有政策、纲领，而无具体法条，缘以判案，难免失轻失重；加以司法干部缺乏，了解与执行政策，容易发生偏差。很明显：值此全国胜利之时，一切要求统一，法律与司法制度之统一更为必需；各种工作进入常轨，维护各种工作之法律，必须逐渐具备。这些弱点，不能让其继续存在。
    华北人民政府成立以来，司法建设，有些进步，平津两市新成立的人民法院亦甚有成就，但离我们的希望还远。为要建设新民主主义中国的法律与司法工作，任务是艰巨的。但我们有马克思主义的普遍真理与中国革命具体实践相结合的毛泽东思想作指导，有二十多年解放区的法律与司法工作的经验，及广大人民创造了与创造着各种有关法律的智慧，只要我们工作努力，善于把握毛泽东思想与善于和人民结合，任务虽艰巨而胜任自愉快的。
