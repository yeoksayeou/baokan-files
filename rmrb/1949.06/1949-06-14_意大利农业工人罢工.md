Italian Agricultural Workers' Strike

　　In May of this year, when the Italian Agricultural Workers' Federation of Trade Unions negotiated with the Landowners' Federation regarding the signing of a national uniform labor contract, the union put forward demands such as determining the daily minimum wage, holiday pay, unemployment relief rights, and ensuring workers are not subject to arbitrary dismissal, and carrying out land reclamation to improve the living conditions of unemployed workers. After the overbearing Landowners' Federation refused these legitimate demands, the Workers' Federation and the General Confederation of Trade Unions secretariat decided to start a strike in northern Italy on May 18, with 600,000 people participating that day. On the 25th, the number of strikers increased to one million and gradually expanded to the central region. At the end of May, although some landlords in Reggio and Sicily had begun to yield, expressing their willingness to accept the workers' demands, most landlords were still resisting stubbornly, and colluding with the reactionary government to suppress the striking agricultural workers with shameless acts such as shooting, expulsion, and sabotage, so the strike continued to persist. There are a total of 2.5 million agricultural workers in Italy, and 2 million have now joined the strike.

　　意大利农业工人罢工
    今年五月间，意大利农业工人联合会总工会，与地主联合会谈判关于订立全国性的单一劳工合同时，工会方面提出了关于确定每日最低工资，假日工资，失业救济权利以及保证工人不受专横的解雇，进行开荒以改善失业工人生活情况等要求。在蛮横的地主联合会竟拒绝这些正当的要求之后，工人联合会和总工会书记处就决定于五月十八日开始在意大利北部实行罢工，当天有六十万人参加。二十五日罢工人数增至一百万，并渐渐扩展至中部地区。五月底，勒佐及西西里的某些地主虽然已经开始低头，表示愿意接受工人的要求，但大部分地主则仍在顽抗，并与反动政府勾结以枪杀、驱逐及破坏等无耻行为镇压罢工的农业工人，罢工遂继续坚持下来。全意共有农业工人二百五十万，现已有二百万人参加罢工。
