The North China Postal Administration Issues Urgent Call to Action:
  Prepare for Rainy Season Postal Work
  Divide Responsibilities to Ensure Smooth Main Lines

    [Our Dispatch] The North China Postal Administration recently issued an urgent call to action to prepare for rainy season postal work, explicitly pointing out: Doing a good job in rainy season work is the central task for July to October. Therefore, it is necessary to pay attention to division of responsibilities by section to ensure the smooth flow of main lines, and to re-stipulate the main line schedule according to the characteristics of the rainy season, advocating early departure, early arrival, and early delivery. For ferries and boats, it is necessary to prepare them one by one to prevent large floods from hindering passage. Attention must be paid to hygiene education. Mail must be sealed and dispatched in batches, and the use of large mailbags is prohibited to prevent moisture damage. At the same time, education on cherishing mail and cherishing tools must be carried out among all employees, and thorough ideological mobilization and hands-on leadership by leaders should be carried out to organize meticulously. In the work process, rewards and punishments must be clearly defined, and a system of rewards and penalties must be established. Work performance during the rainy season should be used as an important basis for evaluation. The call urges everyone to unite, strive for merit, launch a movement to ensure communication and welcome victory, and fight to create model main lines, healthy units, and rainy season work models.
