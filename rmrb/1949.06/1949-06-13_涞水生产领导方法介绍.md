　　Introduction to the Production Leadership Methods in Laishui
    Xin Tuo

    This year's production campaign in Laishui is in full swing, with most tasks completed ahead of schedule, and the seed soaking work has even received a commendation from the Chahar Provincial Government. The leadership methods are introduced below for reference in various places.
    I. From top to bottom, ideological obstacles of cadres and masses were broken, and it was clarified that "production is the central task that overrides everything." All seven districts of Laishui are old revolutionary base areas. The masses have little ideological concerns. Last winter, the county party committee trained more than 1,000 village party member cadres, summarizing land reform and party rectification. Key party rectification and distribution of land certificates were carried out in the villages, generally improving the relationship between the party and the masses, and boosting the production enthusiasm of the masses. The second was to overcome the "rest" mentality of some cadres, emphasize the establishment of a construction mindset, and call on county and district cadres to lead production through production. This has been very effective. During the spring plowing and sowing stage, a total of more than 360 workdays of cadres from five districts (including a few county cadres) helped farmers with farming (mostly helping the families of revolutionary martyrs and soldiers).
    II. Responsible cadres took the lead. For example, at the beginning of seed soaking, everyone lacked experience and confidence. At the county-level cadre expansion meeting, seed soaking experiments were conducted on the spot to teach every comrade. County cadres taught district comrades, district cadres taught village cadres, and village cadres taught the masses, thoroughly implementing the technology. Another example is digging toilets. County Head Du personally helped farmers dig toilets in the Fourth District, which had a great impact. Secondly, propaganda work was strengthened, and blackboards and rooftop broadcasts were used to criticize and commend in a timely manner, which played a significant role. Furthermore, the party branch guaranteed that the village squad leader (a party member) soaked seeds a few days in advance, planting both soaked and unsoaked seeds at the same time. After a few days, the soaked seeds had sprouted, growing vigorously, while the unsoaked seeds had not yet taken root. He used this vivid fact to educate and promote seed soaking among the masses.
    III. Closely grasp the season and specifically deploy tasks. At the county party committee's cadre expansion meeting on April 23rd, cadres were educated not to be concerned about rain, but to actively lead the masses to carry water for point sowing. Seventy-five county cadres formed seven work teams, specifically deploying only tasks such as sowing, tree planting, and toilet digging. Work that was not particularly needed was not combined. Focusing on one task at a time strengthened the cadres' ability to go deep into one village and drive an entire area. Cadres were dispersed for inspection, and timely concentrated reports were made. Many small area village cadre and old farmer symposiums were held to learn from the masses, which also cultivated cadres.
    In addition, vivid and specific slogans such as "Sow early in a leap year" and "If you don't carry water during the spring drought, you'll have a big pout in the fall!" promoted the production campaign.
    IV. Clearly defining tasks is a crucial link in thorough implementation: At the district and village cadre conference, in addition to a detailed report on the production plan, the county party committee printed copies, one for each village, to facilitate promotion and inspection. Daxingguan Village in the Seventh District used the conclusions of the county cadre expansion meeting as a literacy textbook (for people's schools), and its substitute farming work was better than that of other villages.
    V. Launching challenges and timely awarding prizes. At the district and village cadre expansion meeting, the county party committee launched challenge competitions in a planned and purposeful manner. The specific method was "learn from others' strengths to make up for one's own weaknesses." The Fourth District was good at women's production, so it challenged the weaker Sixth and Seventh Districts. The Fourth District had poor autumn cultivated land, few toilets, and did not pay much attention to hygiene, so other districts challenged the Fourth District in this regard. After everyone completed the challenges, the county compiled the challenge plans of each district into a book and distributed it to each village. Subsequent inspections showed that this was very effective. In addition, a reward and punishment system was implemented, and timely evaluations were made. For example, during the first evaluation of tree planting work, sixteen villages received prize flags, and more than ninety individuals received certificates, which greatly promoted tree planting. County and district cadres are now evaluating merits and demerits, which has both improved cadre morale and exchanged experiences.
    VI. Timely solve the concrete difficulties of the masses. In previous years, the county only transported seeds after the land was planted. This year, seeds and agricultural tools were prepared very promptly. In overall leadership, understanding the situation, being familiar with policies, formulating plans, and conducting timely inspections demonstrated strict planning.
    The county's leadership also has shortcomings, such as the fact that some cadres still have a serious commandist style, and the county leadership has neglected livestock breeding and cooperative work, all of which are being gradually overcome.

　　涞水生产领导方法介绍
    辛拓
    涞水今年生产运动搞的轰轰烈烈，一般任务均提前完成，浸种工作且已受到察哈尔省府的通令表扬。现将其领导方法介绍如下，供各地参考。
    一、自上而下的打破了干部及群众的思想障碍，明确了“生产是压倒一切的中心工作”。涞水七个区，全是老区，群众思想顾虑不大，去冬县委又训练了一千多名村党员干部，总结了土地改革与整党；在村中又进行了重点整党与发放土地证，党群关系一般改善，群众生产情绪高涨。其次是克服了部分干部的“休息”思想，强调树立建设思想，号召县区干部以生产领导生产。这样收效很大，总计在春耕播种阶段，五个区的干部（有少数县干部）帮助农民耕种共三百六十多个工（大部帮助了烈军工属）。
    二、负责干部亲自下手。如浸种开始大家都没经验没信心，县里扩干会上，当场实验浸种，教会每一个同志，县干部到区教给区里同志，区干部教村干部，村干部教给群众，一直把技术贯彻到底。又如挖厕所，杜县长在四区亲自帮助农民挖厕所，影响很大。其次加强宣传工作，黑板报、屋顶广播及时批评表扬，起的作用很大。再就是支部保证，村中队长（党员）预先早浸种几天，把浸种与不浸种的种子同时种上，过了几天，浸种的芽都出来了，又茁又壮，没浸种的根还没扎好呢。他拿这活生生的事实教育与推动了群众浸种。
    三、抓紧季节具体布置任务。县委于四月二十三日扩干会上，就教育干部，思想上别结记着下雨，要积极领导群众挑水点播，县干七十五人组成七个工作队，具体只布置了播种、植树、挖厕所等任务，非特别需要的工作不结合，单搞一样，较强干部深入一村带动一片，干部分散检查，及时集中汇报，多开小区村干及老农座谈会，向群众学习，这样也培养了干部。
    此外并提出了生动具体的口号，如“闰月年早种田”，“春旱不挑水，秋后大噘嘴！”推动了生产运动。
    四、明确任务，是贯彻到底的决定一环：在区村干部大会上，县委除详细报告了生产计划外，并油印成册，一村一份，这样便于推动和检查。七区大兴官村把县扩干会结论当成识字课本（民校用），他村的代耕工作，就比别村好。
    五、发动挑战，及时评奖。在区村扩干会上，县委有计划有目的的发动了挑战竞赛，具体办法是“取长补短”。四区妇女生产好，以此来向较差的六、七区挑，四区秋耕地差，厕所少、不太讲卫生，别的区也以此来向四区挑；大家挑战完毕，县里把各区挑战计划签订成册，发到各村，事后检查，这样收效很大。另外还实行了奖惩制度，及时评定，如第一次评植树工作时，得奖旗的十六个村，得奖状的九十多个人，给植树很大推动。现在县区干部正在评功过，这样既提高了干部情绪，又交流了经验。
    六、及时解决群众具体困难。往年地种上，县里才把种子运来，今年种子及农具都准备的很及时。在总的领导上，了解情况，熟悉政策，制定方案及时检查，表现了严密的计划性。
    该县领导上也还有缺点，比如说该县某些干部尚存在着严重的强迫命令作风，县领导上曾忽视了繁殖牲畜及合作社工作等，这些都在逐渐克服中。
