  　Actively Reorganizing Association Affairs
    [Ping City News] The Three People's Principles Comrades Association is currently reorganizing its association affairs, re-registering all members, and gradually establishing branches. Once the aforementioned work is completed, preparations will be made to convene a national conference. It is also learned that as of July of last year, the association's branches and other organizations totaled 28 units.
    [Ping City News] The Chinese Kuomintang Democratic Promotion Association will soon send personnel to various liberated areas to inspect and begin reorganizing association affairs. The association's Central Council Joint Meeting resolved that any local branches that have not yet been reorganized into the current Chinese Kuomintang Democratic Promotion Association and that did not submit work reports before liberation will have their organizations cancelled and new ones established; those that submitted work reports before liberation and have been reorganized under the current name must also be reorganized. It was also decided that because the now-liberated North China, Central China, and other regions are still in a period of military operations, all branches will cease activities, and a strict review and reorganization of existing members and association affairs will be conducted to prevent Chiang Kai-shek's bandits and secret agents from taking the opportunity to infiltrate.

  　积极整理会务
    【平市讯】三民主义同志联合会现正整理会务，重行登记所有会员，并逐渐建立分会。一俟上述工作完成后，准备召开全国性之会议。并悉：该会各地分会等机构，截至去年七月以前为止，共有二十八个单位。
    【平市讯】中国国民党民主促进会即将派员前往各解放地区视察，以着手整理会务。该会中央理事联席会议议决：凡各地分会仍未改组为现行之中国国民党民主促进会、解放前又未有工作报告者，即予取消该机构，另行建立；在解放前有工作报告、并已改组为现行名称者，亦须加以整理。并决定现已解放之华北、华中等地区因尚在军事时期，所有各分会一律停止活动，对原有会员及会务作严格之检讨与整理，以提防蒋匪特务乘机渗入。
