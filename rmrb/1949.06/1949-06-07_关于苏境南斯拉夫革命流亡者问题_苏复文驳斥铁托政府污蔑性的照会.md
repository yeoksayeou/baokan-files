Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, June 6th: TASS reports: On May 23rd, the Yugoslav Ministry of Foreign Affairs delivered a note to the Soviet Embassy in Belgrade, insisting that the Soviet government had adopted "hostile and discriminatory actions" against Yugoslavia, turning the Soviet-Yugoslav treaty into "empty talk." The Yugoslav government attempted to substantiate the above assertion by citing the activities of Yugoslav revolutionary exiles in the Soviet Union, treating this action as hostility towards Yugoslavia. The note concluded with a protest and a request that the Soviet government prohibit the activities of Yugoslav revolutionary exiles in the Soviet Union, particularly the publication of the newspaper of Yugoslav exiles in Moscow.

In response to the Yugoslav government's note, the Soviet Embassy in Belgrade delivered the following note from the Soviet Ministry of Foreign Affairs to the Yugoslav Ministry of Foreign Affairs on May 31st.

In view of the note from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Federal People's Republic of Yugoslavia dated May 23rd of this year, the Soviet Ministry of Foreign Affairs hereby informs your ministry of the following reply from the Soviet government.

The Soviet government rejects the assertion of the Yugoslav Ministry of Foreign Affairs that the Soviet government has taken "hostile and discriminatory actions" against Yugoslavia and considers it a crude slander.

The purpose of this slanderous assertion is obviously to confuse the Yugoslav people and conceal from them the truth, namely, that the real reason for the deterioration of Soviet-Yugoslav relations is Yugoslavia's pursuit of a hostile policy towards the Soviet Union. The Soviet government gave an appropriate assessment of this policy of the Yugoslav government in its note of February 11, 1949.

One should not confuse the Soviet government's attitude towards the current Yugoslav government with its attitude towards Yugoslavia and the Yugoslav people.

Because the Yugoslav government pursues a hostile policy towards the Soviet Union in its activities, establishes an anti-communist and anti-democratic reign of terror in Yugoslavia, and in the struggle against the Soviet Union, due to the logic of the struggle, it has already fallen into the camp of the enemies of the Soviet Union and has turned Yugoslav newspapers into unscrupulous mouthpieces for the anti-Soviet movement carried out by the fascist agents of imperialism. Therefore, the Yugoslav government has deprived itself of the right to expect a friendly attitude from the Soviet side. As far as the Soviet government's attitude towards Yugoslavia and the Yugoslav people is concerned, it has always been and remains friendly.

The numerous facts of Soviet assistance to the Yugoslav people during the war and post-war period are known throughout the world. No one can deny that Yugoslavia's independence is the result of the defeat of Hitler's Germany, in which the Soviet Union played a decisive role. No one can conceal from the Yugoslav people the enormous economic, cultural, technical and other assistance that the Soviet Union has given to the restoration and development of the Yugoslav national economy after the war. It is also well known that the Soviet Union has provided political assistance to Yugoslavia in international affairs; at many international conferences discussing the national interests of Yugoslavia, the Soviet Union has consistently defended Yugoslavia's legitimate interests. All of this is undeniable proof of the Soviet government's friendly policy towards the Yugoslav people.

Therefore, it is not surprising that Yugoslav citizens, who see the guarantee of their country's independence in Soviet-Yugoslav friendship, do not approve of the Yugoslav government's anti-Soviet policy. Now, these citizens are persecuted by the Yugoslav reign of terror, and they can only find an opportunity outside the borders of Yugoslavia to freely and frankly express their opposition to the Yugoslav government's anti-Soviet policy. Yugoslav revolutionary exiles living in Moscow also express the same opposition to the Yugoslav government's anti-Soviet policy and publish their newspapers in Moscow. The Soviet government has decided to treat and protect Yugoslav patriotic exiles who are persecuted by the anti-democratic regime in Yugoslavia because of their democratic and socialist beliefs.

The Soviet government declares that it will continue to treat Yugoslav revolutionary exiles with favor, just as it does now. This, of course, does not mean, as the Yugoslav note mistakenly asserts, that the Soviet government or its state institutions have given the Yugoslav revolutionary exiles "complete support." One cannot confuse the right to protect revolutionary exiles with "complete support" for the actions of revolutionary exiles. Otherwise, it would violate legal principles. As it happens, Yugoslav revolutionary exiles, in essence, do not urgently need the assistance of Soviet government institutions, because many Soviet communities and Soviet citizens fully and adequately support Yugoslav revolutionary exiles, regarding them as their friends and brothers. However, this undoubtedly means that the Soviet government does not prevent the actions of Soviet people supporting Yugoslav revolutionary exiles. The Soviet government considers it necessary to state that it does not, in fact, prevent and does not intend to prevent Soviet citizens from supporting Yugoslav revolutionary exiles, because this form of action by Soviet citizens and Soviet communities is an unchangeable right recognized by the Soviet Constitution.

Therefore, in view of the above, the Soviet government can only regard as politically reckless and intellectually confused the assertion in the Yugoslav note of May 23rd of this year that the Soviet government's sheltering of Yugoslav revolutionary exiles and not preventing their activities is "the crudest interference in Yugoslavia's internal affairs." The Yugoslav government "demands" (what a real demand!) in the note that "the Soviet government prohibit..." the "publication of newspapers" by Yugoslav revolutionary exiles. In other words, the Yugoslav government "demands" that the Soviet Union take repressive measures and imprison communists, democrats, non-party members, and all those who generally advocate Soviet-Yugoslav friendship, as is done in present-day Yugoslavia, in order to establish an anti-communist and anti-democratic reign of terror at home. Does the Yugoslav government not find that this absurd "demand" is equivalent to "the crudest interference" in the Soviet Union's internal affairs? Does the Yugoslav government not realize that making such an absurd "demand" puts it in a ridiculous position?

The Yugoslav note calls the Yugoslav revolutionary exiles staying in the Soviet Union "traitors to their country." But the Soviet government holds a different opinion. The Soviet government believes that the Yugoslav revolutionary exiles are true socialists and democrats, the true children of the indomitable fighters for Yugoslav independence, and the creators of Soviet-Yugoslav friendship. If one is to look for Yugoslav traitors, then they should not be sought among the Yugoslav revolutionary exiles, but among those gentlemen who are trying to undermine friendship between the Soviet Union and Yugoslavia in order to weaken Yugoslavia and thus prepare it for the same fate as those countries that have already fallen into the shackles of imperialism and have lost their independence.

　　关于苏境南斯拉夫革命流亡者问题
    苏复文驳斥铁托政府污蔑性的照会
    【新华社北平六日电】塔斯社讯：五月二十三日，南斯拉夫外交部递交贝尔格莱德苏联大使馆照会一件，硬说苏联政府对南斯拉夫采取“敌意和歧视行动”，使苏南条约变成“纸上空谈”。南斯拉夫政府企图以援引苏境南斯拉夫革命流亡者的活动，来证实其上述断言，照会中把这一行动当作是对南斯拉夫的敌意。照会最后提出抗议，并要求苏联政府禁止苏境南斯拉夫革命流亡者的活动，特别是禁止莫斯科南斯拉夫流亡者的报纸出版。
    为了回答南斯拉夫政府的照会，贝尔格莱德苏联大使馆于五月三十一日将苏联外交部的如下照会递交南斯拉夫外交部。
    鉴于南斯拉夫联邦人民共和国外交部本年五月二十三日的照会，苏联外交部谨以苏联政府的下列答复通知贵部。
    苏联政府拒斥南斯拉夫外交部说什么苏联政府对南斯拉夫采取“敌意和歧视行动”的断言，并认为这是粗劣的诽谤。
    此种诽谤断言之目的，显然在迷惑南斯拉夫人民并向南斯拉夫人民隐瞒这一真象，即促使苏南关系趋于恶化的真正原因，是南斯拉夫奉行对苏的敌意政策。苏联政府在其一九四九年二月十一日的照会中，曾对南斯拉夫政府的此种政策给予恰当评价。
    人们不应把苏联政府对现时南斯拉夫政府的态度与它对南斯拉夫和对南斯拉夫人民的态度混淆起来。
    由于南斯拉夫政府在其活动中奉行着对苏的敌意政策，在南斯拉夫建立反共和反民主的恐怖制度，在进行反对苏联的斗争中，由于斗争中的逻辑，它已经——堕入苏联敌人的阵营，并已使南斯拉夫的报纸变成肆无忌惮的、为帝国主义的法西斯代理人所进行的反苏运动的喉舌。因此，南斯拉夫政府剥夺了自己可望能够获得苏联方面友好态度的权利。就苏联政府对南斯拉夫和对南斯拉夫人民的态度而论，它一直是、而且现在依然是友好的。
    苏联在战争和战后时期给予南斯拉夫人民以援助的许许多多事实，是举世周知的。没有谁能否认南斯拉夫之成为独立国是由于击败希特勒德国的结果，而在击败希特勒德国上，苏联是起了决定性作用的。任何人也不能对南斯拉夫人民隐瞒苏联在战后南斯拉夫国民经济的恢复和发展中所给予的巨大的经济、文化、技术和其他各方面的援助。同样为众所周知的是苏联在国际事务方面给予南斯拉夫的政治援助；在许多讨论有关于南斯拉夫国家利益的国际会议上，苏联曾一贯地维护南斯拉夫的正当利益。这一切都是苏联政府对南斯拉夫人民奉行友好政策的无可争辩的证明。
    因此，从苏南友谊中看到了他们国家独立之保证的南斯拉夫公民，对南斯拉夫政府所遵循的对苏敌意政策不表赞同，那是用不着惊异的。现在，这些公民被南斯拉夫的恐怖制度所迫害，他们只有在南斯拉夫的国境之外，才能发现有自由和坦率地表明他们对南斯拉夫政府反苏政策持反对态度的机会。住在莫斯科的南斯拉夫革命流亡者对南斯拉夫政府的反苏政策，也表示同样的反对态度，并在莫斯科出版他们的报纸。苏联政府决定对因为他们的民主和社会主义的信仰而受到南斯拉夫反民主制度迫害的南斯拉夫爱国流亡者以优待，并予以保护。
    苏联政府宣布：它将来也将象现在一样给南斯拉夫的革命流亡者以优待。这自然并不象南斯拉夫照会所错误断言的那样，意味着苏联政府或它的国家机构，已给予南斯拉夫革命流亡者以“完全的支持”。人们不能把保护革命流亡者的权利和“完全支持”革命流亡者的行动，这两种不同的事情混淆起来。否则就违背了法理。恰巧，南斯拉夫革命流亡者从基本上说，并不迫切需要苏联政府机构的援助，因为许多苏联社团和苏维埃公民完全而充分地支持南斯拉夫革命流亡者，把他们看作是自己的朋友和兄弟。但是，这无疑地意味着苏联政府并不阻止苏联人民支持南斯拉夫革命流亡者的行动。苏联政府认为必须声明：它实际上并不阻止而且也不打算阻止苏联公民支持南斯拉夫革命流亡者，因为苏维埃公民和苏联社团这种行动的方式是苏联宪法所认可的不可更改的权利。
    因此，鉴于上述各节，对于今年五月二十三日南斯拉夫照会中硬说苏联政府因为庇护南斯拉夫革命流亡者且不阻止他们的活动是“最粗野地干涉南斯拉夫内政”的这种断言，苏联政府只能认为是政治上轻率与理智上糊涂的结果。南斯拉夫政府在照会中“要求”（好一个真正的要求！）“苏联政府禁止……”南斯拉夫革命流亡者的“报纸再行出版”。换言之，南斯拉夫政府“要求”苏联象在现在南斯拉夫那样，对共产党人、民主人士、无党派人士及所有一般主张苏南友好的人们采取镇压的措施并加以监禁，以便在国内建立反共与反民主的恐怖制度。难道南斯拉夫政府没有发现这种荒谬的“要求”就等于“最粗野地干涉”苏联的内政吗？难道南斯拉夫政府没有想到提出这种荒诞的“要求”就使它自己处于可笑的地位吗？
    南斯拉夫照会把留苏的南斯拉夫革命流亡者称为他们“国家的卖国贼”。但苏联政府持有不同的意见。苏联政府认为南斯拉夫革命流亡者——是真正的社会主义者和民主人士，是争取南斯拉夫独立的不屈不挠的战士们的真正儿女和南苏友好的缔造者。假若有人要寻找南斯拉夫卖国贼的话，那么他们不应该在南斯拉夫革命流亡者当中去寻找，而应当到那些先生当中去寻找，那些先生们竭力想破坏苏联与南斯拉夫间的友谊，以便削弱南斯拉夫，并从而为它准备一个与那些业已堕入帝国主义束缚和业已失掉他们独立性的国家相同的命运。
