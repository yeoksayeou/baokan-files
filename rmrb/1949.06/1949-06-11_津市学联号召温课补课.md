    【新华社天津十日电】 Tianjin, June 10th (Xinhua) - The Tianjin Student Federation has called on students in all schools throughout the city to quickly launch a review and make-up lesson campaign. Due to the chaotic conditions in some schools in the early days of Tianjin's liberation, some schools have not yet finished this semester's courses, and some students have not thoroughly grasped the material that has been taught. Therefore, the Student Federation has specifically called on students of major middle schools and universities to make up all their lessons before the end of this semester. It also pointed out that this is a summative learning exercise, not just to prepare for the final exam. Student unions in all schools should immediately launch widespread publicity, stop all unnecessary meetings and activities, and complete this semester's learning tasks with the joint efforts of all teachers and students.

　　津市学联号召
  　温课补课
    【新华社天津十日电】天津市学生联合会顷号召全市各校同学迅速展开温课补课运动。由于天津市解放初期，部分学校秩序混乱，迄今有的本学期课程还未讲完，有的同学对讲过的课程学得不够踏实，因此学联特号召各大中学校同学，在本学期结束以前，补齐一切功课。并指出：这是一个总结性的学习，不是专为应付大考。各校学生会应即展开广泛宣传，停止一切不必要的会议与活动，在全体师生共同努力下，完成本学期的学习任务。
