　　Rapid Development of Postal Services in North China
  　15,000 Li of Postal Routes Added in Six Months
    Increased Number of Bureaus and Stations at All Levels; Expanded Scope of Services
    [Report from this Newspaper] Postal services in North China have seen significant development in the past six months. The total length of postal routes in the region now reaches 187,012.8 li. Three units (referring to the number three, the number four and the number three again), handled over 13.6 million pieces of mail in three months. Regarding the construction of postal routes, the main routes were previously in rural areas, with very short automobile and train postal routes. Postal transportation relied on manpower, horse-drawn carts, and pack mules. After the complete liberation of North China, railways, highways, and shipping gradually recovered. The total length of main and branch postal routes in the region was 19,501 li in 1948. By 1949 (six months), it had reached 34,679 li, an increase of 15,178 li. Among these, train routes increased by 3,930 li, automobile routes increased by 796 li, and ship routes increased by 6,667 li. All of these were newly added. The increase in these three types of modern postal routes alone totaled 11,395 li. Horse-drawn cart routes increased by 629 li, and bicycle routes increased by 3,690 li. The total length of district routes (county to district) is 152,333 li, of which bicycle routes account for 11,403 li, and foot routes account for 39,890 li. Regarding organizational construction, after the complete liberation of North China, the organization greatly increased. In 1948, there were a total of 2,010 bureaus, stations, and offices at all levels in the region. In 1949 (six months), after deducting 257 units that were transferred and 71 units that were merged, there were still 3,433 units (including 672 new ones and 512 transferred from other regions). Regarding business development, the policy this year is to develop old businesses, create new businesses, expand concurrently operated businesses, expand joint postal services, and improve and gradually unify systems. All businesses that can be universally opened are opened. Those limited by manpower and material conditions are organized with a focus, and gradually promoted. The original services of China Post can be gradually restored according to work needs and manpower and material conditions. In developing business, flat rate letters, registration, printed matter, newspapers, parcels, remittances, subscription of newspapers, and sale of books are mainly strengthened through publicity, relaxed restrictions, improved procedures, and expanded scope. The method of sending news稿件(news drafts) in bulk with zero postage has been universally implemented throughout the region, which not only facilitates the sending of drafts by correspondents, but also saves postage costs and simplifies procedures. In order to reward large quantities of mail, printed matter, ordinary newspapers, and parcels, etc., a wholesale payment method has been implemented, with discounts of 10% or 5% depending on the amount of mail, and parcel post offices are being opened as much as possible. The limit for ordinary parcels has been increased from seven kilograms to ten kilograms, and the limit for large parcels has been increased from ten kilograms to twenty kilograms and thirty kilograms. With the development of train and automobile postal routes, the scope of large parcel delivery is being expanded at any time. The scope of purchasing and selling books and subscribing to newspapers on behalf of customers is being promoted. In addition to this region, a large number of subscriptions to newspapers in various liberated areas and large cities such as Beiping, Tianjin, Taiyuan, Zhangjiakou, Datong, Baoding, and Shijiazhuang are being carried out. The existing horse-drawn cart trunk lines use the surplus capacity of postal routes to concurrently handle passenger and freight transportation. Expanding concurrently operated businesses, selling stamp tax tickets, and collecting taxes on behalf of the government: Beiping, Tianjin, and Taiyuan have negotiated with the local tax bureaus to handle these businesses after liberation. Post offices sell passenger tickets for ships and automobiles on behalf of passengers, and the relationship between each other is very close. Expanding joint postal services: In the past, due to the incomplete liberation of the region, the currency system was not unified, and the systems were inconsistent, so generally only flat rate letters and registered mail were mutually exchanged. In some areas, even only flat rate letters were exchanged. Now, mail is exchanged with the Northeast, Shandong, Jinan, Jinxi, and Central Plains liberated areas. Wherever there are trains, large parcels of 30 kilograms can be mutually exchanged, and ordinary parcels under 5 kilograms can be received. Tianjin and other places are designated to handle express delivery items. For the Jiangnan and other newly liberated areas, in addition to promptly receiving and sending general mail as soon as an area is liberated, efforts are also made to actively strive for mutual exchange of parcels and heavy mail. Currently, 5-kilogram parcels are temporarily being exchanged with large cities in Jiangnan such as Shanghai, Nanjing, Wuhan, and Xi'an. After agreeing, the scope will be continuously expanded and the weight will be increased. Telegraphic transfers between North China and major cities in East China and Central China have also been opened. When the former Tianjin-Shanghai navigation was opened, general mail to non-liberated areas and international mail were collected and sent in accordance with the "Measures for Postal Communication between North China and Foreign Countries" promulgated by the North China People's Government, and Tianjin and other places were designated to receive parcels from non-liberated areas. When the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang overturned the postal agreement at the end of April, we actively negotiated with ships between Tianjin and Hong Kong, and began on May 15 to carry mail from non-liberated areas and forward it to various places by the Guangzhou Post Office, but only for light items. As for foreign mail, it is divided into land and sea routes: the land route is forwarded to the Soviet Union via Harbin, and the sea route is forwarded via Hong Kong. Due to the expansion of postal areas, mail has greatly increased: last year, the entire region only received and sent 21,107,729 pieces of various mails. This year, from January to March alone, 13,654,201 pieces were received and sent, an average of more than 4.5 million pieces per month.

　　华北邮政工作迅速发展
  　半年增邮线万五千里
    各级局站增多业务范围扩大
    【本报讯】华北邮政工作半年来获广大发展。现全区邮线长达一八七、○一二·八里。三、四三三个单位，三个月收寄邮件一千三百六十余万件。邮线建设方面，过去的主要干线在农村，汽车火车邮线极短，邮务运输系依靠人力、马车、驮骡。华北全部解放后，铁路、公路、航运逐渐恢复，全区邮路干、支线，一九四八年为一万九千五百零一华里，至一九四九年（半年）即为三万四千六百七十九华里，计增加一万五千一百七十八华里。其中火车班增加三千九百三十华里，汽车班增加七百九十六华里，轮船班六千六百六十七华里，全为新增加者，单以上三种近代邮线的增加即达一万一千三百九十五华里；马车班增加六百二十九华里，自行车班增加三千六百九十华里。区线（县至区）全长十五万二千三百三十三华里，其中自行车班邮线一万一千四百零三华里，步班邮线为三万九千八百九十华里。组织建设方面，华北全部解放后，组织大为增加。一九四八年全区各级局站所共二千零十处，一九四九年（半年）除划出二五七处，裁并七一处外，还有三千四百三十三处（其中新的六百七十二处，由其他区划来五百十二处）。业务建设方面，今年的方针是发展旧业务，创办新业务，开展兼营业务，扩大联邮业务，改进与逐渐统一制度。凡可普遍开办的业务一律开办，凡为人力物力条件所限制的，即重点举办，逐渐推广。中华邮政原有之业务，按工作需要及人力物力条件可以逐一恢复。在发展业务上，所举办之平信挂号、印刷品、新闻纸、包裹、汇兑、代订报纸、代售书籍等，主要是加强宣传，放宽限度，改进手续，推广范围。新闻稿件零寄整付办法已在全区普遍实行，不仅便利了通讯员寄稿，而且节省了邮票成本，简便了手续。为了奖励大批交寄邮件、印刷品、普通新闻纸、包裹等，又实行了整寄整付，按邮件之多少分别予以九折或九五折之优待，尽量增开办理包裹局所，并将普通包裹由七公斤提高到十公斤，加大包裹由十公斤提高到二十公斤与三十公斤，随着火车、汽车邮线之开展，随时扩展加大包裹之邮寄范围。推广代购代售书籍及代订报纸之范围，除本区外，大量开展代订各解放区及大城市报纸，如北平、天津、太原、张家口、大同、保定、石家庄等局。现有马车干线利用邮线余力兼办客货运输。开展兼营业务，代售印花税票及代收税款：北平、天津、太原于解放后即与当地税局分别商妥办理。邮局代售轮船汽车客票，彼此间关系非常密切。扩大联邮业务：过去因地区未完全解放，币制不统一，制度不一致，故一般只互寄平信及挂号，有的地区甚至只通平信。现在与各解放区通邮的计有东北、山东、晋南、晋西北、中原。凡通火车之处互寄三十公斤之加大包裹，五公斤以下则可普通收寄。平津等地指定办理快邮递件。对江南及其他新解放地区，除每解放一地，即及时收寄一般邮件外，并尽量主动争取互通包裹及重件邮件。现与江南之上海、南京、武汉及西安等大城市，暂已通五公斤之包裹。待商得同意后继续扩大范围，并提高重量。华北与华东、华中各主要城市之间电报汇兑也通了。前津沪通航时，即按华北人民政府颁布之华北区对外通邮办法之规定收寄非解放区及国际之一般邮件，并指定平津等地收寄非解放区之包裹。当四月底蒋介石匪帮推翻通邮协定后，我乃积极与津港间轮船洽商，于五月十五日开始载运非解放区之邮件由广州邮局转发各地，但仅限于轻件。至于国外邮件，则分陆海两路：陆路由哈尔滨经苏联转发，海路由香港转发。由于通邮地区扩大，邮件已大为增加：去年全年全区仅收寄各种邮件二千一百一十万七千七百二十九件，今年仅一月至三月即收寄一千三百六十五万四千二百零一件，平均每月四百五十余万件。
