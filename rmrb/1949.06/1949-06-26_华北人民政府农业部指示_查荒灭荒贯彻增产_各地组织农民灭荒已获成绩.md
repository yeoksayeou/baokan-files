The Agricultural Department of the North China People's Government Issues Directive
Investigate and Eliminate Wasteland to Implement Increased Production
Various Regions Organize Farmers to Eliminate Wasteland and Have Achieved Results

[By Our Own Correspondent] The Agricultural Department of the North China People's Government recently issued a directive on the work of investigating and eliminating wasteland, the full text of which is as follows:

The sowing of crops in various regions has been largely completed, and the work of investigating and eliminating wasteland should be carried out immediately. According to incomplete statistics from April, there are approximately 2.6 million mu of wasteland in the entire region. From the perspective of soil quality, about 70% of it is clay soil or sandy loam, suitable for planting general crops; about 30% is sandy alkaline land, suitable for afforestation and planting red osier and pasture. From the perspective of the reasons for the abandonment, 80% of it is in newly liberated areas, due to the long-term oppression, plunder, and robbery by the Japanese, Chiang, and Yan bandits, resulting in depopulated areas, and the masses lack labor and livestock, and are unable to cultivate the land due to lack of resources. For example, in Taiyuan, under Yan Xishan's "soldier-peasant unity" tyranny, there were more than 1.5 million mu of wasteland. In the areas of Hebei, Shandong, Henan, under the Chiang bandits' two years of offensive and sweeping operations, 400,000 mu of wasteland were created. In these areas, disasters are severe, and the lives of the masses are very difficult. In the old and semi-old liberated areas, there is still a portion of land not distributed at the end of the land reform (mostly poor land) and land belonging to fleeing households. If this batch of wasteland is cultivated, with an average yield of two dou of coarse grain per mu, the entire region can increase its income by more than 500,000 shi, which will not only increase farmers' income and alleviate disasters, but also play a significant role in eradicating pests and ensuring increased production on fertile land. At a time when the war support tasks in North China have been greatly reduced, the work of investigating and eliminating wasteland is an important link in implementing the production increase plan. Although many achievements have been made in eliminating wasteland in various regions, there is still a lot of potentially eliminable wasteland that has not been completely eliminated, and the local leadership must pay sufficient attention to it. In order to ensure the smooth progress of this work, based on past experience, the following points must be noted in investigating and eliminating wasteland:

\tFirst, send cadres to specifically understand the wasteland situation, such as the area, soil quality, yield, as well as the local labor, livestock, and the living and production levels of the masses, and consult with the masses to formulate active plans, steps, and methods for eliminating wasteland, starting from reality, and separately planting general crops and late-maturing autumn vegetables; if there is a lack of labor and fertilizer or the soil quality is poor, planting pasture and trees are all good.

\tSecond, carry out extensive and in-depth publicity and mobilization, and announce policies to reward production and eliminate wasteland, such as determining land ownership, guaranteeing income, and reducing and exempting burdens, and earnestly implement the Ministry of Agriculture's April 5th rewards for increasing agricultural production and eliminating barren land, prohibiting the opening of mountain wasteland, in order to break the ideological concerns of the masses and give full play to their enthusiasm for eliminating wasteland.

\tThird, earnestly carry out specific leadership, such as organizing mutual assistance in labor and livestock, adjusting agricultural tools and seeds, and mediating land ownership disputes and other specific issues. When necessary, the government should provide possible assistance, such as lending grain and seeds, to solve the difficulties of the masses in production materials when eliminating wasteland. In addition, special attention should be paid to the wasteland of revolutionary martyrs and their families during the investigation of wasteland. In addition to making every effort to mobilize them to cultivate it themselves, for those who really have no labor, because the war support tasks have been greatly reduced at present, the work of substitute farming can be strengthened to solve the problem.

[By Our Own Correspondent] In order to increase production, farmers in various parts of North China have achieved considerable results in eliminating wasteland under the promotion of Party, government, and people's organizations at all levels. According to incomplete reports from various regions, such as in the nine counties of Leting in eastern Hebei, more than 135,600 mu of cultivated wasteland had been eliminated and 12,150 mu of virgin wasteland had been opened up by mid-May. Statistics from six counties in the fourth district of Taihang show that 100,000 mu of cultivated wasteland have been eliminated. In seven natural villages in Jining, Suiyuan, 2,000 mu of cultivated wasteland have been opened up. In Xin County, 108,000 mu of cultivated wasteland have been eliminated, accounting for 72% of the county's total wasteland area. In other counties, the proportion is also above 50%. For example, in the five districts of Shouyang, 24,400 mu of the original 35,600 mu of virgin and cultivated wasteland have been eliminated, accounting for 68% of the original wasteland. The investigation and elimination of wasteland is also being carried out in central Hebei. Currently, 256,330 mu have been eliminated in the fourteen counties of the eighth district alone. Wen'an County has also organized a joint wasteland investigation team, which has not only eliminated general wasteland, but also planted 1,940 mu of hemp. In the three administrative offices of Chahar Province, 486,000 mu of wasteland have been eliminated. The main reason for achieving these results is the implementation of the policy of production and elimination of wasteland, determining land ownership, guaranteeing income, and reducing and exempting burdens, which has greatly boosted the production enthusiasm of the masses. In some places, such as Taiyuan and Hebei-Shandong-Henan, in the intervals of intense war support combined with production, women and children were still able to be mobilized in large numbers to carry out wasteland reclamation movements such as human-powered plowing and hoeing.

　　华北人民政府农业部指示
  　查荒灭荒贯彻增产
    各地组织农民灭荒已获成绩
    【本报讯】华北人民政府农业部顷发出关于查荒灭荒工作的指示，全文如下：
    各地播种已大体完成，查荒灭荒工作应即进行，全区荒地据四月份不完整统计，约有二百六十余万亩，从土质上看，其中百分之七十左右系胶土、沙质壤土，可种一般作物；百分之三十左右系沙碱地，适于造林及种植红荆、牧草等。从荒废原因上看，百分之八十系在新解放区，由于日蒋阎匪长期压榨、抢掠，造成无人区，群众劳力畜力缺乏，无力无种，如太原在阎匪的“兵农合一”暴政下，就有荒地一百五十万多亩，冀鲁豫河南地区在蒋匪的二年来进攻扫荡下，造成荒地四十万多亩，这些地区，灾荒严重，群众生活十分困难。在老解放区及半老解放区尚有一部在结束土改时未分配之土地（多为坏地）及逃亡户土地，如果这批荒地一经垦种，每亩以平均收二市斗粗粮计，全区能增收五十余万市石，不独可增加农民收益，减轻灾荒，且对根绝虫害，保证良田增产，也有很大作用。当此华北全部解放战勤任务大大减少的情况下，查荒灭荒工作实为贯彻增产计划的重要环节之一。目前消灭荒地，虽各地已有不少成绩，但还有许多可能消灭的荒地，尚未完全消灭，仍须引起当地领导上的足够重视。为了保证此项工作顺利进行，根据以往经验，查荒灭荒中，必须注意以下几点：
    一、首先派出干部，具体了解荒地情况，如面积、土质、产量以及当地劳力畜力、群众生活生产水平等条件，和群众商订积极灭荒计划步骤与办法，从实际出发，分别种一般作物及晚苗秋菜；如果劳力肥料缺乏或土质差，种牧草植树都是好的。
    二、进行广泛深入的宣传动员，宣布奖励生产灭荒政策，如确定地权、保障收益、减免负担等项，认真执行农业部四月五日奖励农业增产，奖励消灭平荒禁开山荒，以打破群众思想顾虑，发挥其消灭荒地积极性。
    三、认真进行具体领导，如组织劳力畜力互助，调剂农具种籽，以及调解地权纠纷等具体问题。必要时政府给以可能的帮助，如贷粮贷种籽，以解决群众消灭荒地时生产资料的困难。此外在查荒中还要特别注意烈军工属的荒地，除尽力发动其自垦外，对确无劳力者，因目前战勤大为减少，可加强代耕工作，予以解决。
    【本报讯】华北各地农民为增加生产，在各级党政民组织推动下，消灭荒地已有相当成绩。根据各地不完全报告，如冀东乐亭等九县在五月中旬已消灭熟荒十三万五千六百余亩，开生荒一万二千一百五十亩。太行四专六县统计，已消灭熟荒十万亩。绥远集宁七个自然村，开熟荒二千亩。忻县已消灭熟荒十万八千亩，占该县总荒地面积的百分之七十二。其他各县也在百分之五十以上，如寿阳五个区生熟荒地三万五千六百亩已消灭二万四千四百余亩，占原荒地百分之六十八。冀中查荒灭荒亦在开展，仅八分区十四个县目前已消灭二十五万六千三百三十余亩，文安县并组织了联合查荒组，除消灭一般荒地外，并种大麻一千九百四十亩。察省三个专署灭荒四十八万六千亩。所以取得这些成绩，主要由于贯彻生产灭荒政策，确定地权，保障收益，减免负担，群众生产情绪十分高涨，有的地方如太原、冀鲁豫等地，在紧张支前结合生产的空隙下，仍能大量发动妇女儿童开展人拉犁、刨地等垦荒运动。
