    Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 21st—With the assistance of the people, the Shanghai Military Control Commission of the People's Liberation Army, after days of investigation, has uncovered a large amount of hidden materials and capital belonging to war criminals Kong Xiangxi, Yan Xishan, and others. Before the liberation of Shanghai, Kong's Yangzi Construction Company concealed a huge amount of materials worth millions of US dollars, which could not be transported, by dispersing them among more than a dozen Chinese and foreign trading companies, shops, warehouses, factories, depots, and private residences. After the liberation of Shanghai, personnel from the Trade Department of the Military Control Commission went to Yangzi Company and its various warehouses to take over the assets, only to find that the materials had been moved away and the former personnel had disappeared. Later, through extensive investigation by the Trade Department personnel and layer-by-layer tracing, all the above-mentioned materials were discovered and confiscated. The 130 warehouse receipts, 1,700 bags of flour, 100 boxes of Western medicine, and other materials hidden in Shanghai by war criminal Yan Xishan's Northwest Industrial Company were also discovered by the Military Control Commission with the cooperation of people from all walks of life and former employees of the company. The Military Control Commission also found Kong's capital of 116,200 shares among the 118,500 shares of British-owned 利威 Liwei Company and immediately confiscated them. Fuzhong Company, belonging to war criminal Song Ziwen, has also been investigated and seized. Other hidden materials of the Kuomintang bandit gang that have been seized include more than 2,800 boxes of machine parts and more than 900 barrels of gasoline and engine oil from the 10th Supply Zone of the puppet Joint Logistics Command. The above situation shows that tracking down the hidden materials of war criminals and bureaucratic capital is a huge and meticulous task, which deserves the attention of military control commissions in other newly liberated cities.

    沪隐藏官僚资本及物资大量被我查获
    【新华社上海二十一日电】人民解放军上海军管会在人民协助下经多日侦察，查获战犯孔祥熙、阎锡山等的大量隐藏物资及资本。孔系扬子建设公司于上海解放前曾将不及运走的价值数百万美金的巨额物资，分散隐藏在十多家中外商公司、商号、堆栈、工厂、仓库及私人住宅中。上海解放后军管会贸易处人员前往扬子公司及其各个仓库进行接收，发现物资已迁移一空，旧有人员亦无踪影。后经贸易处人员多方侦察，层层追查，始将上述物资全部查获没收。战犯阎锡山所办西北实业公司在沪隐匿的一百三十张栈单、一千七百袋面粉、一百箱西药，及其他物资，亦在各阶层人民及该公司旧职员的合作下为军管会查获。军管会并在英商利威公司的十一万八千五百股股金中，查出了孔系资本十一万六千二百股，当即予以没收。战犯宋子文系的孚中公司亦已查获。其他被查获的国民党匪帮的隐藏物资有伪联勤第十补给区的机器零件二千八百余箱及汽油、机油九百余桶。上述情况说明追查战犯和官僚资本隐藏的物资是件很巨大而细密的工作，值得引起其他新解放城市军管会的注意。
