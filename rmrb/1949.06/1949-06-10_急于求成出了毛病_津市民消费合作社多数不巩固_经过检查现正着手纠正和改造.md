Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, June 9th. Tianjin's municipal consumer cooperatives are undergoing rectification. As of May 5th, 137 cooperatives had been established throughout the city, with a total of over 162,000 members. However, due to the weak leadership of the All-China Federation of Supply and Marketing Cooperatives and the district authorities, the foundation of most cooperatives is extremely unstable. The Federation of Supply and Marketing Cooperatives has therefore decided to suspend development from May onwards, conduct inspections, and consolidate and improve the business of each cooperative.

The inspection revealed that some cooperatives, by implementing the mass line in the establishment process and aligning their business operations with the needs of the broad masses of members, have achieved rapid development. For example, the Fifth Street Cooperative in the Fourth District, even with over 2,000 members, saved them more than 110,000 yuan in the twenty days after its establishment, gaining the support of its members. However, the inspection also revealed that many cooperatives have significant shortcomings and errors. Firstly, some cooperative cadres lacked a clear ideology of serving the members and adopted an undemocratic work style, failing to solicit members' opinions on business operations. The organizational structure of some cooperatives was unsound, lacking the diligent establishment of meeting systems and accounting systems, and failing to promptly disclose accounts and report business conditions to members. Some cooperatives have experienced extravagance and waste, and even corruption. Secondly, in terms of business operations, some cooperatives lacked planning. Without careful investigation into the actual needs of members, they blindly purchased goods, leading to unsold inventory, tied-up funds, and hindered business development. Some cooperatives had complicated sales procedures, causing inconvenience to members; while others did not restrict the quantity of purchases by members, leading to speculation by merchants, or members reselling after purchase. Some cooperatives frequently changed prices, and prices varied between cooperatives, providing opportunities for speculators. More seriously, some cooperatives engaged in transactions with non-members and even violated government laws by selling goods on behalf of private merchants without taxation, becoming disguised sales agents for speculators. Still others failed to promptly return debts to the Federation of Supply and Marketing Cooperatives, instead depositing them in banks to generate interest or engaging in their own businesses.

The reasons for these shortcomings are mainly due to the leading cadres of the Federation of Supply and Marketing Cooperatives not correctly estimating subjective strength and being too eager for quick results at the beginning of the establishment of the cooperatives, leading to large-scale development without steady progress. As a result, many cooperatives suffered from numerous problems due to weak leadership. Secondly, the mass line was not well implemented in the establishment process, and staff members were not democratically elected but were appointed, or found by the cooperative committee members themselves, leading to a complex composition of employees. In the recruitment of members, some cooperatives were not cautious enough, allowing some speculators, local bullies, and ruffians to infiltrate the cooperatives, and even usurp leadership.

After these deviations were discovered, each cooperative, with the assistance of the inspection team of the Federation of Supply and Marketing Cooperatives or the economic section of each district government, began to correct and transform them. In addition to a few cooperatives with particularly serious situations that have been reorganized according to the opinions of the members (and the expulsion of speculative and disruptive elements), the general approach is to conduct meetings and reviews, and carry out criticism and self-criticism to rectify business operations. The Supply and Marketing Branch of the Eighth District, at the directors' meeting of each cooperative, strictly criticized a small number of corrupt, selfish cadres, made them return embezzled items, admit their mistakes to the members, and guarantee future correction. The Fifth District also held a joint meeting of cooperative directors in the entire district, deciding to improve business operations. The Federation of Supply and Marketing Cooperatives has decided to continue inspecting each cooperative, and in the inspection process, select better accounting personnel, and the Federation will open training courses for short-term training to help each cooperative establish a unified accounting system. In addition, the Federation of Supply and Marketing Cooperatives plans to appropriately reduce the number of cooperative units to strengthen leadership.

　　急于求成出了毛病
  　津市民消费合作社多数不巩固  经过检查现正着手纠正和改造
    【新华社天津九日电】津市市民消费合作社正进行整顿中。截至五月五日，全市已建社一百三十七个，社员共十六万二千余人。但由于供销合作总社及区的领导力量薄弱，多数社基础极不巩固。供销总社遂决定自五月份起，暂停发展，进行检查，以巩固并提高各社业务。
    在检查中发现有些社由于在建社过程中贯彻了群众路线，业务经营适合广大社员的需要，因而得到迅速发展。如四区五街社成立后的二十天中，即使社员二千多人省钱十一万余元，得到社员的拥护。但同时也发现不少社存在着许多严重的缺点与错误。首先是有的合作社干部缺乏明确的为社员服务的思想，作风不民主，在业务经营上没有征求社员的意见。有些社的组织机构不健全，没有认真地建立会议制度和会计制度，没有及时向社员公开帐目，报告业务情况。有些合作社则发生铺张浪费，甚至贪污腐化的现象。其次，在业务经营上：有些社缺乏计划性，对社员的实际需要未经细密调查即盲目购货，以致存货卖不出去，积压资金，妨碍业务开展。有些社售货手续繁复，使社员感到不少麻烦；而另一些社则对社员购货数量不加限制，以致被投机商套购，或社员买后又转卖出去。有些社经常变更货价，且各社间货价也不一致，因此予投机商以钻空子的机会。更严重的是有的社给非社员作买卖，甚至违背政府法令，替未经征税的私商代售东西，成了变相的投机商的代售店，还有的社没有及时将欠款归还供销总社，而存在银行里生息，或自己作生意。
    发生这些缺点的原因，主要是由于供销总社的领导干部，没有正确估计主观的力量，在开始建社时急于求成，大量发展，未能稳步推进。因此许多社因为领导薄弱而毛病百出。其次是在建社过程中没有很好地贯彻群众路线，工作人员都不是民主选举、而是指定的，或由社务委员自己找的，以致职员成份复杂。在吸收社员上，有些社也不够慎重，使一些投机商人、地痞、流氓钻入合作社，甚至篡夺了合作社的领导权。
    这些偏向被发现以后，各社即在供销总社检查组或各区政府经济股协助下，着手予以纠正和改造。除情形特别严重的个别社已根据社员意见实行改组（对投机破坏分子则予以清洗）外，一般的都采取开会检讨，进行批评与自我批评的方式，整顿业务。八区供销分社在已召开各社的主任会议上，曾对少数贪污腐化、自私自利的干部进行了严格的批评，让其退出贪污的东西，并向社员承认错误，保证今后改过。五区也举行了全区合作社主任联席会议，决定改进业务。供销合作总社已决定对各社继续进行检查，并在检查中挑选较好的会计人员，由总社开设训练班进行短期训练，帮助各社建立统一的会计制度，此外，供销总社并拟适当减少社的单位，以便加强领导。
