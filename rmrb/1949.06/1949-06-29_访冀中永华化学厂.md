　　Visiting the Yonghua Chemical Factory in Central Hebei
    By Our Correspondent Lin Yuan
    As the train traveling along the Dezhou-Shijiazhuang line enters Xinji Station, the first thing that catches the eye is a cluster of neat new buildings within a red, low-walled compound covering over sixty mu in the southeastern outskirts of the city. Even more striking is the chimney towering into the sky, ceaselessly spewing smoke day and night. In this quiet town, the discovery of such a large-scale factory building invariably elicits surprise and eager inquiries from long-distance travelers. Those familiar with the area will tell them: This is the Yonghua Chemical Factory of central Hebei.

    Not long ago, when the revolutionary base areas were still in small towns and vast rural areas, fighting against the Kuomintang reactionaries who occupied the big cities in arduous years, the people of the liberated areas, following the principle of self-reliance, began to establish the necessary small-scale industries. Most of them started from scratch, from nothing to something, from small to large, and only developed after a period of hard work. Until now, some of them are still young, but at that time they played a certain role in the economic struggle against the enemy. Yonghua Chemical Factory is one of the thousands of infants in the big family of industrial construction in the old liberated areas.

    Its predecessor was a small workshop for making caustic soda, founded in 1946. It was originally a production unit of the Xinji Municipal Government, with four or five workers and one cadre. The technology was very poor, and the caustic soda produced could not crystallize. This is still used as a joke: "What you make is not caustic soda, but caustic soda water!" However, under the enemy's economic blockade, which attempted to strangle the liberated areas, it satisfied the needs of users to some extent and brought about many soap workshops in Xinji City. Later, the production unit of the government was cancelled and changed to a public factory in the Eleventh District of central Hebei. Because the textile industry in the vast rural areas developed like mushrooms after rain, in order to supply military and civilian needs, the factory produced not only caustic soda, but also sodium sulfide, sulfur blue, bleaching powder, soda ash, etc. However, due to poor equipment and technical conditions, the sulfur blue was very hygroscopic and could not retain its color when dyeing cloth. Technician Zhang Yingnian overcame various difficulties and, after several experiments, reduced the amount of sodium sulfide and determined the proportion of various raw materials, finally achieving a quality that was not hygroscopic and could maintain its color. In 1948, the industry of the liberated areas moved from decentralization to unification, and the factory was transferred to the leadership of the central Hebei Industrial Corporation. As the liberated areas expanded and demand exceeded supply, under the principle of supporting the factory with its own profits, new workshops were built starting in June of that summer, including 300 rooms for workers' dormitories, which were completed in half a year. Tools and equipment were added, laying the foundation for the current increase in production. For example, in the first half of last year, the sodium sulfide team had 41 workers and produced 1,064 barrels of sodium sulfide. In the second half of the year, the average number of workers making sodium sulfide was 170, and the output increased to 5,980 barrels. In this year's Red May production campaign, 76 sodium sulfide workers reached a monthly output of 2,264 barrels.

    If the factory's work was still in a rather naive stage before the campaign, this Red May production campaign did push the factory a step further towards regularization. The main reason is that in this spring's "recall and return to the team" movement, the factory's administration reviewed the past shortcomings of relying insufficiently on workers, cleared up some harmful bourgeois ideas of pursuing profits too much and neglecting workers' welfare, and began to implement democratic management more seriously. In addition to re-electing the factory management committee, joint meetings of team leaders, union group leaders, and worker activists were frequently held to use them as a bridge to connect with the workers. At the beginning of the movement, attention was paid to workers' health, masks and aprons were added, and attention was paid to the cleanliness of workers' dormitories. On the workers' side, they also cleared up some incorrect ideas of "learning technology and preparing to leave the factory to start their own business," and began to realize their position as masters in state-owned factories. On this basis, they also launched an inspection of waste, put forward ideas and methods for everyone, creating a conscious mass movement. Therefore, the savings in this production movement achieved the following results: saving labor and saving raw materials and tools worth more than 1.78 million yuan, equivalent to 80% of the factory's total expenditure. A small thing is enough to illustrate the depth of the savings movement. For example, drivers Luo Furi and Lü Runze went to Baoding on official business for 20 days. The meal fee was set at four jin of flour per person per day. Usually, others often did not have enough when they went out, but they saved 2,000 yuan.

    When the reporter entered the workshop, the temperature inside the room was particularly high because the boiler for burning crude alkali was burning day and night. It was even more difficult to approach the front of the outlet, but the workers were always waiting by the fire, repeatedly inserting a ten-foot-long iron rake into the hearth to turn the goods. In a few minutes, they were sweating profusely. The hot weather and the scorching boiler could not restrain their production enthusiasm, and it showed the greatness of the working class even more. They launched a red flag competition between teams, and no one wanted to fall behind. During the movement, a strict shift handover system was established, and team meetings were held every five days, and they all seriously made self-criticisms. Team leader Wei Zhihe told the reporter: "Now the workers have opened their minds and are taking their work very seriously. Individual backward workers have also been brought up by everyone." A sentence of mutual encouragement is popular among the workers: "Produce more, save more, even if we are serving the people." Zhao Shuliang, who used to be consistently backward in his work, has now made progress with the help of others and has such an understanding: "Our factory has a future, it is expanding day by day. In the future, when production develops and the economy prospers, the workers' lives will be better."

    June focused on improving quality. Since the cooling pot was equipped with a drawing pipe, before the movement, the inspection of sodium sulfide mostly had a one-inch gray bottom, but now there is no gray bottom at all, and the purple bottom has also been reduced. The average pure amount of sodium sulfide per barrel is 57.15%, and the best is 62.5%. Under the guidance of technician Zhang Yingnian, the sulfur blue team is experimenting with replacing the previously used carbolic acid and nitric acid with chlorobenzene in order to reduce costs. Their slogan: "Catch up with the Gongzi sulfur blue of Tianjin!" The technician and the workers are well integrated, especially technician Yuan Yishan is very active. He often delays meals due to work, but their experimental equipment is very simple. On the laboratory table, there is an old balance with incomplete weights, replaced by iron wire for measurement. They try their best to overcome difficulties. In order to save the amount of chlorobenzene, they broke the ready-made method of various chemical factories in Tianjin and changed the ratio of various raw materials, relatively reducing chlorobenzene. Although the quality is still a little worse, it has reduced costs. For example, Tianjin Chemical Factory uses one catty of chlorobenzene to produce only two and a half catties of sulfur blue. The new method uses the same amount of chlorobenzene to produce three catties of sulfur blue. The experiment is continuing to improve quality and is preparing for mass production. When the reporter asked Technician Zhang about his experience in overcoming difficulties, he said very modestly: "As long as you work with the workers, trust each other, and all difficulties can be overcome. To achieve this, you need to put down your personal airs of being superior first. I didn't understand this before, but now I realize this truth." This simple and honest self-analysis is an enlightenment for the general intellectuals who are preparing or are being reformed.

    After several days of observation, especially in talking with the workers, the reporter felt that some of the factory's wages were still unreasonable, especially some apprentices should be promoted to workers, and should be adjusted appropriately as soon as possible. The apprentice period should be clearly defined. Secondly, although the system of reading newspapers and attending classes has been established among the workers, it is not frequent enough. In order to further improve the workers' awareness, this aspect needs to be strengthened. Although the factory's administration has helped the trade union, it is not enough. The trade union should play a collective leadership role and establish normal departmental work. Finally, the factory gives the overall impression that from the deputy factory director to the workers, most of them are working diligently for the people's industrial construction, and the whole factory presents a new and vigorous atmosphere. Although there are still some unscientific and unsound aspects in the production organization, these shortcomings will be gradually overcome. Comrade Sun Weihan, deputy director of the factory, said when talking about the savings achievements in May: "This proves that we were too wasteful in the past and let the people down too much! We cannot be satisfied with this, and we must continue to implement it in the future."

　　访冀中永华化学厂
    本报记者  林远
    沿德石线往返的客车，当进入辛集站最先触入眼帘的，在市东南郊外占地方圆六十余亩红色的短墙内，露出一片栉比齐整的新房。更吸引人注意的，耸入高空的烟囱，从早到晚不息地喷着烟雾。——象这僻静的市镇里，发现如此规模的工厂建筑，远路的旅客都不禁显露出惊异而争相探问了，熟悉的人将告诉他们：这就是冀中的永华化学厂。
    当不久以前，革命根据地还处在小城镇及广大农村，和国民党反动派占领大城市作斗争的艰苦岁月里，解放区人民遵循自力更生方针，开始建立必需的小型工业，它们大多是白手起家，由无到有，由小到大，经过一段艰苦缔造才发展起来，直到现在，它们中间有的虽还幼稚，但在当时对敌经济斗争中，都起了一定的作用，永华化学厂就是老解放区工业建设大家庭裹千百襁褓中的一个。
    它的前身，是一个制火碱的小作坊，创办于民国三十五年，原是辛集市政府的机关生产，四五个工人，一个干部，技术很差，制出的火碱液体不能结晶，到现在还成为人们开噱的资料：“你们制的不是火碱，是火碱水！”但这在敌人施行经济封锁，妄想窒死解放区的情况下，却也在某种程度上满足了需要者，带起了辛集市的许多肥皂作坊。后来取消了机关生产，改成冀中十一分区的公营工厂，因广大农村纺织业如雨后春笋似的发达，为供应军需民用，该厂除制火碱外，还制硫化碱、硫化青、漂白粉、碱面等，唯因设备和技术条件差，硫化青的吸潮性很大，染布时保不住色，技师张英年克服了各种困难，几经试验，减少了硫化碱，确定了各种原料的比例，终于做到不吸潮，且能保持色的质量。民国三十七年，解放区的工业由分散走向统一，该厂改归冀中实业公司领导；因解放区扩大，产品供不应求，在以厂养厂的原则下，夏季六月开始建设新工房，连同工人宿舍共三百间，半年始竣工，添置了工具及设备，打下了目前增产的基础。如去年上半年硫化碱股工人四十一名，共产硫化碱一千零六十四桶，下半年制硫化碱工人平均一百七十人，产量增到五千九百八十桶，今年的红五月生产运动，硫化碱工人七十六名月产量即达二千二百六十四桶。
    如果说在运动前，该厂工作尚处在相当幼稚的阶段，这次红五月生产运动，确推动该厂向正规化前进了一步。主要原因，在今春“回忆归队”运动中，该厂行政上检讨了过去依靠工人不足，清算了某些多追逐利润而疏忽工人福利有害的资产阶级思想，比较认真的开始民主化的管理，除改选了工厂管理委员会，并常召开各班长、工会组长及工人积极分子联席会，以他们作为联系工人的桥梁。运动伊始即注意工人健康，添置了口罩、围裙，注意了工人宿舍清洁。工人方面，也清算了某些“为学技术，准备出厂另起炉灶”不正确的打短思想，开始意识到工人在国营工厂中的主人翁地位，在此基础上又展开检查浪费，提出人人出主意，想办法，造成自觉的群众性运动，因此，这期生产运动的节约才获得如下的成绩：节省人工及节约原料工具等共值一百七十八万余元，等于本厂全部开支的百分之八十。一件小事就足说明节约运动的深入，如车夫骆福瑞、吕润泽二人因公到保定出车二十天，饭费规定每人每天四斤面，平常别人出门常不够，他俩却节余了二千元。
    当记者进入工房参观时，因烧粗碱的锅炉在日日夜夜的燃烧着，房内温度特别高，出货口前更炽的人不敢逼近，工人们却在一旁时刻伺候着火，翻复的用一丈长的铁扒伸入炉膛翻货，几分钟功夫，即汗流夹背，炎热的天气加上炽热的锅炉都遏不住他们的生产热忱，愈显示了工人阶级的伟大。他们展开了班与班之间夺红旗运动，谁也不肯落后。运动中并建立了严格的交接班制度，隔五天举行一次班会，都认真的做检讨。一班长魏致和告记者说：“现在工人都开了脑筋，都看活很当紧，个别落后的也被大伙带上去了”。在工人中流行着互相鼓励的一句话：“多生产点，多节省点，就算咱们为人民服务了”。过去工作一贯落后，现经别人帮助有了进步的赵树良也有了这样的觉悟：“咱们的工厂有前途，一天比一天扩大，将来生产发展了，经济繁荣了，工人的生活就更好了。”
    六月份以提高质量为重点，自冷却锅装置了拉管以后，运动前检查硫化碱多有一英寸灰底，现在一次灰底也没有，紫底也减少了。每桶含硫化碱的纯量平均为百分之五十七点一五，最好的达百分之六十二点五。硫化青股在技师张英年的指导下，为降低成本，正试验用氯化苯代替过去用的石炭酸和硝酸，他们的口号：“向天津公字硫化青看齐！”技师和工人结合的很好，特别是技工袁义山很积极，常因工耽误了饭，但他们的实验设备是十分简陋，实验室案上放一着架陈旧的天秤，法码不全，量制铁丝代替，他们想尽办法克服困难，为了节省氯化苯的用量，他们打破了天津各化学厂的现成制法，改变了各种原料的比量，相对的减少了氯化苯，质量虽还差些，却降低了成本，如天津化学厂用一市斤氯化苯，仅产二斤半硫化青，新法试验用同等量的氯化苯，可产三斤硫化青。现实验继续提高质量，并准备大批制造。当记者问及张技师克服困难的经验时，他很虚心的说：“只要和工人打成一片，互相信任，一切困难都能克服，要做到这点，需先把个人自居高明的架子放下，从前还不懂这，现在才体会到这个真理。”这种朴素老实的自剖，对一般准备或正在改造的旧知识分子，恰是一种启示。
    记者经几天的观察，特别是和工人谈话中，感到该厂工资有的还不合理，特别是有些学徒该升成工人了，应及早适当的调整，学徒的年限极应明确。其次，工人中虽建立了读报与听课制度，但不经常，为进一步提高工人觉悟，这方面需加强；该厂行政对工会虽有了帮助，但还不够，工会应发挥集体领导，建立正常的部门工作。最后，该厂给人总的印象：从正副厂长到工人，大多兢兢业业地为人民的工业建设而努力，全厂呈现着一种崭新蓬勃的朝气，虽然在生产组织上还有不够科学健全的地方，但这些缺点会逐渐得到克服。该厂副厂长孙维汉同志在谈及五月份节约成绩，曾这样说：“这证明过去，我们太浪费了，太对不起人民了！我们不能满足于此，今后还要继续贯彻下去。”
    一九四九、六月、十七日。
