　　Simple Method for Catching Mole Crickets

　　Zhao Sanbao and two other children from Xinzhuang Village, Hunyuan East, used a very simple and effective method to catch mole crickets in order to lure spring birds. In one afternoon, in just over an hour, they caught more than forty of them. The method is as follows:

　　Mole crickets, seeking warmth and food, often lurk in shallow burrows near the surface of the ground. When you find a burrow with a lot of loose soil, approach quietly and use a spindle-style iron rod, about one and a half feet long and four-tenths of an inch thick (referred to as a "fire pillar" in Hunyuan). Insert it into the loose soil following the burrow. Hold the handle of the rod and shake it up and down, making the "fire pillar" vibrate with a "da-da" sound. At the same time, watch the surrounding loose soil. When the mole cricket hears the sound below, it will emerge from the ground around the loose soil, and you can catch it.

　　This method is simple and effective. Women and children can do it. It is worth trying in various places.

　　捉蝼蛄简法
    浑沅东辛庄村赵三保等三个小孩，为了用蝼蛄诱捉春鸟，用一种最简便的有效办法捉拿蝼蛄，在一天下午，一点多钟的时间，便捉了四十多条，其捉法如下：
    蝼蛄为取暖寻食，长时潜伏在地上层很浅的穴道里。如果发现虚土很多的穴道时，就悄悄走过去，用辘轳把式的铁棍，长约一尺五寸，粗约四分，（系浑沅的火柱）顺着穴道插入虚土里，手持柱把，上下摇动，使火柱振动的哒哒有声，同时可向虚土的四周注视，蝼蛄听见下边的响声，便从虚土的周围钻出地面，即可把它捉住。
    这个办法又简便、又有效，妇女儿童都能做到，各地不妨试用。
