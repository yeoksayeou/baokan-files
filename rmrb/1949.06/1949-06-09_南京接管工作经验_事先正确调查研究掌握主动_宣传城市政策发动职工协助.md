　　Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, 8th. The Nanjing Military Control Commission's Financial and Economic Takeover Committee's takeover of twelve economic agencies and units of the Kuomintang government, including the Ministry of Economic Affairs, the Resources Committee, and the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry, has been completed on the 3rd of this month after a month. The following is a summary of the takeover experience of each unit: (1) Prior to the takeover, there must be correct investigation and research into the organization, nature, scope, characteristics, and other aspects of the agency being taken over. Then, based on the situation, decide on the takeover methods, steps, staffing, and prioritize them according to importance. Only in this way can we seize the initiative in the takeover work. (2) Systematically understand the situation from top to bottom, publicize the urban policies of the Chinese Communist Party and the Chinese People's Liberation Army, and explain the significance of the takeover. At the same time, mobilize workers and staff from bottom to top to assist in inventorying. The two should be closely integrated; otherwise, not only will it be difficult to clearly count the materials, but it will also lead to detachment from the masses. For example, during this takeover of various factories, the main responsible persons of the factories and the responsible persons of each unit were first summoned for discussions, and meetings were held according to the system to announce the "Eight Rules of the People's Liberation Army" and the takeover methods. This played a significant role in stabilizing the emotions of the staff. Furthermore, systematic takeover was carried out according to the original enterprise structure. After the initial inventory of materials, under the guideline of relying on workers and uniting staff, self-reporting and inspection were launched. For those who did not make clear explanations, self-reporting was encouraged, and those who reported were commended; inspection was carried out, and those who concealed information were persuaded. In this way, a considerable amount of materials that were not on the inventory list were also cleared out. (3) For enterprise departments that are beneficial to the national economy and people's livelihood, the takeover work is best carried out simultaneously with the preparation for resumption of work, if conditions permit. The Hua Zhong Mining Bureau's takeover and resumption of work proceeded simultaneously, and the workers and staff were in high spirits because they felt that if the takeover was completed quickly, they would have work to do and their lives would be guaranteed. Therefore, the takeover work and the inventory of materials proceeded very quickly. (4) The control of takeover work should be differentiated according to the degree of importance and urgency. The difficulty in the takeover work is the issue of accounting. Due to the repeated changes of the puppet currency and the inconsistency of units, it is not easy to calculate clearly in a short time. If there are not enough takeover cadres to allocate, the accounting should be temporarily postponed during the takeover, and the takeover of raw materials and tools should be carried out first. This can not only solve the difficulty of the lack of cadres, but also achieve the purpose of gradual inventory, and at the same time, it can make the resumption of work easier.

　　南京接管工作经验
    事先正确调查研究掌握主动  宣传城市政策发动职工协助
    【新华社南京八日电】南京市军管会财经接管委员会对国民党政府经济部、资源委员会、农林部等十二个经济机关单位的接管工作，历时一月，已于本月三日接收完毕。兹综合各单位的接收经验如下：（一）对被接收机关的组织、性质、范围、特点等各种情况，事先要有正确的调查研究，然后根据情况决定接收办法步骤、配备干部、分别轻重，这样在接管工作上才能掌握主动。（二）从上而下有系统地了解情况，宣传中国共产党与中国人民解放军的城市政策，讲解接管意义；同时要自下而上发动工人、职员协助清点。两者应密切结合，否则，不但物资不易点清，且会脱离群众。如这次接收各厂时，首先召集厂方的主要负责人及各单位负责人谈话，按照系统召开会议，向他们宣布人民解放军的约法八章及接管办法，对稳定职员情绪曾起了很大作用；并能按照原来企业机构进行有系统的接收。初步清点物资后，又在依靠工人、团结职员的方针下，发动自报与检查；对交待不清的，一面发动自报，报出的表扬；一面进行检查，瞒报的加以说服。这样对未上清册的物资也清出不少。（三）有益国民生计的企业部门，在可能条件下，接收工作最好与准备复工同时进行，华中矿务局接收与复工并进，工人、职员情绪很高，因为他们觉得赶快办妥接收，就有工作做了，生活也有保障了。因此接收工作，清点物资工作进行很快。（四）接管工作的掌握，要分别轻重缓急。接收中的困难是帐目问题。由于伪币几度更改，单位不一，一时不易算清；如果接管干部不够分配，接收时应该将帐务暂缓清查，先进行原料、工具的接收，这样既可解决干部缺乏的困难，又可达到逐步清点的目的，同时也可使复工较易实现。
