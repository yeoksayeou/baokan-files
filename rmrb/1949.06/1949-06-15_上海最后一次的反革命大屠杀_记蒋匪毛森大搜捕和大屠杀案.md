　　Shanghai's Last Counter-Revolutionary Massacre
  　A Record of Chiang Kai-shek Bandit Mao Sen's Massive Arrests and Massacre
    Gao Yan · Xuan Wen
    As the light of liberation rapidly spread throughout Jiangnan, only the isolated island of Shanghai was still shrouded in a final, sinister cloud. Mao Sen and a group of murderous demons carried out large-scale secret arrests and massacres against the people of Shanghai. We cannot yet ascertain the exact number of this bloody massacre, but based solely on the accounts of eyewitnesses and some fragmented written records, it can be confirmed that Mao Sen and other murderous demons slaughtered at least one thousand people during their last month of rule in Shanghai. The figures estimated by many people who know some of the inside story range between two thousand and four thousand. Chiang Kai-shek's twenty-two years of counter-revolutionary rule in Shanghai began with the massacre of striking workers and ended with the last and largest secret massacre. Now, let's take a look at a few fragments from the final chapter of this history of counter-revolutionary rule by massacre!
    　　　　Mao Sen's Murder Machine
    Mao Sen—this is the murderous demon whom all the people of Shanghai wanted to capture and execute. When the People's Liberation Army entered Shanghai's urban area on the morning of May 25th, the first few slogans seen on the streets were "Capture the Murderous Demon Mao Sen Alive," prominently displayed alongside "Welcome the People's Liberation Army" and "Celebrate the Liberation of Shanghai."
    Mao Sen's public positions were Chief of the Second Division (Intelligence) of the Pseudo-Garrison Headquarters for the Beijing-Shanghai-Hangzhou Area and Chief of the Pseudo-Shanghai Police Bureau. While Tang Enbo and Chen Daqing oversaw overt slaughter and sabotage, Mao Sen led a group of special agent minions to carry out semi-overt and completely secret arrests and massacres. They coordinated with each other, striving to buy time to destroy buildings and equipment in the face of the PLA's advance while simultaneously arresting and slaughtering the people of Shanghai on a large scale. Mao Sen said at a dinner party at the Hongkou Police Sub-Bureau on May 13th: "Shanghai is a jade bottle, and I must smash it before I leave! Destroy it!" Mao Sen's murder machine included the Political Section "Flying Fortress" of the Pseudo-Police Bureau, the Intelligence Section of the Pseudo-Garrison Headquarters, his own guard, and many other secret special agent organizations. In April, after Mao Sen took office as Police Chief, he began to establish a Political Section with Kuomintang secret agents as its core, engaging in a series of independently conducted secret arrests and massacres. After the PLA crossed the Yangtze River, the Pseudo-Ministry of National Defense's Bureau of Investigation and Statistics in Taiwan sent nearly three hundred more special agent assassins to secretly murder the people of Shanghai. The "Flying Fortress" was a fleet of armed vehicles equipped with the latest communications equipment, lighting equipment, and high-speed equipment. Its maximum speed allowed it to be dispatched within twenty seconds of receiving an alert and reach every corner of the city (including the suburbs) within fifteen minutes. After taking office, Mao Sen began to use this high-speed mechanized killing equipment as a "funeral car" for carrying out arrests and executions.
    　　　　The Great Arrests
    After the People's Liberation Army crossed the Yangtze River in force and Nanjing was liberated, the counter-revolutionaries in Shanghai suffered a heavy blow. They were in despair, suspicious of everything, and open, semi-open, and secret frenzied large-scale arrests began. They arrested people on the streets in broad daylight, in dark alleys, in factories, schools, shops, government offices, public places, high-rise buildings… searching and arresting everywhere. When a teacher deemed "suspicious" was arrested by the police, two students happened to be asking the teacher for guidance and were also arrested as "accomplices." A passenger waiting a long time for the No. 8 trolley bus complained, "Why hasn't the Eighth Route Army arrived yet?" and was immediately arrested for the crime of "colluding with bandits." A retired Kuomintang soldier was also arrested for "impersonating a soldier" because he had a "military handbook" on him. When two neighbors went to bail him out, they were also detained as "suspected accomplices." In late April, more than three hundred students from specialized schools and above were imprisoned together in a temporary prison converted from Daren Middle School. People dared not go out casually, dared not talk about right and wrong, and even when confined at home, there was always the threat of "disaster falling from the sky." The people of Shanghai lived in terror, restless all day long.
    　　　　A Book of Life and Death
    When the sound of the PLA's artillery shook Mao Sen's liver and lungs, this murderer hurriedly burned all traces of his crimes in the open space behind his office. It is currently very difficult to investigate the names of the thousands of people who were murdered in Shanghai. We have obtained a surviving book of life and death. This is only one of dozens. And many secret victims, even those without records to be examined, are even more difficult to count.
    In this blood-stained book of life and death, marked with red ink, are recorded the eternally immortal heroic names of countless revolutionary fighters and innocent people. From the first half of April until the liberation of Shanghai, in the span of one and a half months, this single book of life and death records as many as three hundred and thirty-six murder victims. Their crimes include "bandit suspect," "political," "unspecified," "bandit spy," "suspicious," "impersonating a soldier," etc., and those murdered for the crime of "unspecified" even exceeded half the total. The occupations of the three hundred plus victims included workers, farmers, students, professors, vendors, sailors, rickshaw pullers, shop assistants, actors, teachers, businessmen, waiters, clerks, boiler operators (selling boiled water), barbers, police, etc.
    　　　　Brutal Massacre
    Public executions and secret killings were carried out frantically. Many innocent people who had committed the "unspecified" crime were forced to wear the label of "silver dollar peddlers" and were executed on the streets in front of the Great World or the Great New Company. The reactionaries attempted to use the heads of the people to stabilize the financial chaos they had created. In the interrogation room of the Political Section of the Pseudo-Police Headquarters, day and night, especially late at night, intermittent, miserable cries were constantly heard. Workers and students fighting against hunger and for freedom were being subjected to torture. A female teacher, whose name is still unknown, had her breasts cut off for the crime of "bandit spy." The "prisoners" in the same cell heard her agonizing screams of unyielding resistance until she was butchered alive. When Feng Hua Middle School teacher Zhou Yuande was interrogated, his legs were broken. When his mother came to see him, she saw that his head was wrapped in black cloth. She recognized her son from his trousers and cried out her son's childhood name. The mother was immediately beaten by bandits, and the son was immediately dragged to Song Park and shot. At first, the interrogations were extremely cruel, using waterboarding with chili water, fingernail removal, electric shocks… all the tortures the executioners could think of were used. However, this torture did not extract the confessions Mao Sen needed. So, Mao Sen simply ordered that executions be carried out regardless of whether there was evidence. Anyone with a little conscience was placed on the blacklist of the Political Section and the Bureau of Investigation and Statistics. Within ten days, seventy-eight people were killed. Hongkou Sub-Bureau police officer Wang Keren had all ten of his fingernails removed. He said he advocated democracy. At the time of execution, he shouted, "Long live the Chinese People's Liberation!" Police officer Zhang Qianyi was scalded to death with boiling water. Mao Sen personally interrogated a police officer named Qian Zongying, first cutting off all ten of his fingers, then using wire to string him up and beat him. But when he was shot, the heroic and unyielding martyr Qian Zongying shouted, "Long live Chairman Mao!"
    Song Park, Hongkou Park, and the Puqiu Fire Experiment Field on Zhongxing Road were all semi-public execution grounds where bandits slaughtered people like flies. Whether it was day or night, people's hearts tightened whenever the Flying Fortress drove by on the road. Residents near the execution grounds had to close their doors and windows and were not allowed to peek. The criminals were so vicious and so afraid of being seen with blood on their hands. But the citizens secretly watched from the cracks in their doors, seeing batches of workers and students shouting slogans and dying generously. On May 12th, three workers about to be executed at the Zhongxing Road execution ground shouted, "We are patriotic!" The special agents then blindfolded the victims, gagged their mouths, and finally tied their hands and feet backward, stuffed them into burlap sacks, and threw them into the Huangpu River. No one knows the number of these secret nighttime massacres, and we can only learn something from the floating corpses that had not yet drifted away. By May 22nd, more people were arrested and rushed to the execution ground in just a few hours.
    　　　　"Kill Them All"
    The slogan of the murderous demon Mao Sen was to "smash" and "destroy" Shanghai. Until the evening of May 24th, he continued this bloody massacre. When the PLA had already entered the urban area from the western suburbs, Mao Sen personally led his guards in the courtyard of the police station and shot nine "political prisoners" before fleeing, two of whom were his subordinates. Then, with a group of accomplices, he quietly slipped away in the dark. War criminal Mao Sen did not expect the PLA to arrive so quickly and hurriedly issued an order: "The situation has suddenly changed, kill them all." More than thirty revolutionary "political prisoners" in the investigation brigade of the Pseudo-Garrison Headquarters on Weihaiwei Road had their eyes blindfolded and were waiting for the prison van to come and execute them. Just at that moment, the PLA attacked the urban area of Shanghai and liberated this group of "political prisoners"! The murderer's time was gone forever! The war criminals at the Huangpu Prison of the Pseudo-Bureau of Investigation and Statistics, the Pseudo-Police Headquarters, and the Shanghai Prison… did not have time to "kill them all"!
    After the Military Control Commission took over the Pseudo-Police Bureau and the Pseudo-Court, a total of two hundred and seventy-three Communist Party members, workers, students, patriotic democratic people, and many citizens were welcomed out of prison from the court and the Police Headquarters, Penglai, Huangpu, Tilanqiao and other three sub-bureaus alone.
    The blood debt left by murderous demons such as Mao Sen is something the people of Shanghai will never forget. The people of Shanghai must avenge the revolutionary fighters and people who were murdered by counter-revolutionary special agents, and track down and bring murderers like Mao Sen to justice one by one, even if it means searching the ends of the earth!

　　上海最后一次的反革命大屠杀
  　记蒋匪毛森大搜捕和大屠杀案
    高岩·煊文
    当解放的光辉迅速普照江南，只有上海孤岛还笼罩着最后一片阴森森的乌云的时候，毛森等一群杀人魔王向上海人民实行了大规模的秘密逮捕和屠杀。我们目前还无法了解这个血腥屠杀的确切数字，但是仅仅根据目击者的叙述以及一些片断的文字纪录，就可以肯定毛森等杀人魔王在上海统治的最后一个月至少屠杀了一千人民。许多了解一部分内幕的人所估计的数字，则在二千与四千之间。蒋介石在上海的二十二年反革命统治，是以屠杀上海起义工人开始，也是以最后一次最大的秘密屠杀来结束的，现在请看一看这部反革命统治的屠杀史的最后一章的几个片断吧！
    　　　　毛森的杀人机构
    毛森——这是上海人民皆欲得而诛之的杀人魔王。当人民解放军在五月二十五日晨进入上海市区时，在街头最先看到的几条标语便是与“欢迎人民解放军”“庆祝上海解放”等赫然并列着的“活捉杀人魔王毛森”。
    毛森的公开职务，一个是伪京沪杭警备总司令部的第二处（情报）处长，一个是伪上海警察局局长。汤恩伯、陈大庆主持着公开的屠杀破坏，毛森则率领一批特务喽罗进行半公开的和完全秘密的逮捕屠杀。他们互相配合着，一面在解放军的进攻面前争取时间破坏建筑设备，一面大肆逮捕和屠杀上海人民。毛森五月十三日在虹口警察分局的会餐席上所说：“上海是只玉瓶，在临走的时候我一定要打碎它！毁灭它！”毛森的杀人机构包括有伪警察局的政治处“飞行堡垒”、伪警备司令部的情报处和他自己的警卫队，以及其他许多秘密特务机关。四月间，毛森就任警察局长后，便开始建立一个以军统特务为核心的政治处，从事一系列的各自单独进行的秘密逮捕屠杀活动。解放军渡江后，台湾伪国防部保密局又派来近三百个特务凶手，以便更多地暗杀上海人民。“飞行堡垒”、是一种有着最新的电讯设备、照明设备和快速设备的武装汽车队，最高度的机动速度可以在获警后二十秒钟出动，十五分钟内到达全市（包括市郊）的每一个角落。毛森上任就开始利用这个高速度的机械化杀人设备，作为进行逮捕和执刑的“丧车”。
    　　　　大搜捕
    当人民解放军大举渡江和南京解放后，上海的反革命分子受到了一个沉重的打击，他们丧魂落魄，疑神疑鬼，公开的半公开的和秘密的疯狂大搜捕也开始了。他们在大白天的马路上捉人，在阴暗的弄堂里捉人，在工厂、学校、商店、机关、公共场所、高楼深厦……到处搜查捕捉。一个被认为“嫌疑”的教员被警察捕捉时，适有二位学生正在向这位老师请教，于是也被当做“同党”而一同被捕。一个久久等候着第八路电车的乘客抱怨说了一句“八路为啥还不到”，便犯了“通匪”罪而立即被捕。一个退役的国民党军人因为身边带有“军人手牒”，也以“冒充军人”罪名被捕，两位邻居前去保释他时，又被看成“同党嫌疑”同被扣押。四月下旬，专科以上的三百多学生一同被关进了达人中学改成的临时监狱，人们不敢随便出门，不敢谈论是非，即使困居家中，也时时有“祸从天上降”的威胁。上海人民在恐怖中惶惶不可终日。
    　　　　一本生死簿
    当解放军的炮声震撼着毛森的肝肺时，这个杀人犯匆忙在他的办公室后面的空坪上焚毁一切犯罪的痕迹。要查考上海几千个被杀害人民的姓名，目前是很困难的，我们获得了一本幸存的生死簿。这只是几十本中的一本。而许多秘密的甚至无簿籍可稽的牺牲者更是难以统计。
    在这本鲜血淋漓朱笔点点的生死簿上，记载了无数革命战士和无辜人民永垂不朽的英名。从四月上半月开始到解放上海时止的一个半月内，单这一本生死簿上记载的被杀害者就达三百三十六名之多，他们的罪名有“匪嫌”、“政治”、“不详”、“匪谍”、“可疑”、“冒充军人”等等，而其中犯“不详”罪而被杀害者竟超过半数。三百多被害者的职业包括工人、农民、学生、教授、小贩、水手、车夫、店员、演员、教员、商人、茶房、职员、烧老虎灶（卖开水的）、理发匠、警察等等。
    　　　　残酷的屠杀
    公开的枪杀和秘密的处死在疯狂地进行着。许多犯了“不详”罪的无辜人们被戴上一顶“银元贩子”的帽子，被架到大世界或大新公司门前的马路上枪杀了。反动派企图借人民的头来平抑自己所造成的金融紊乱。伪警察总局政治处的审讯室内，每天从早到晚，特别是深夜里，时时传出断断续续的凄惨的号叫。反饥饿争自由的工人学生，在受着酷刑。一位到现在还没有人知道名字的女教员，因“匪谍”的罪名而被割去了乳房。同监的“犯人”听到她宁死不屈的惨叫，直到她被活活的割死。奉化中学教员周渊德被审讯时，腿被打断了，母亲来看他的时候，看见他的头正被黑布裹着。她从裤子辨别出自己的儿子，失声叫出了儿子的乳名，这位母亲马上遭到匪徒毒打，儿子也马上被拖到宋公园枪杀了。开始时审讯是非常残酷的，灌辣椒水、剥指甲、通电流……刽子手们所能想出来的一切酷刑都使用。但是，这酷刑逼不出毛森所需要的口供。于是毛森索性下令，不问有无证据，一律枪决。稍有良心的都被列入政治处和保密局的黑名单，十天之内，被杀者就有七十八人。虹口分局警员王克仁十个指甲被剥光了，他说他是主张民主的，临刑时他还高呼：“中国人民解放万岁！”警员张谦益被用开水活活烫死。毛森亲自审讯一个叫做钱宗英的警员，首先将他的十个指头砍掉，又用铁丝穿起他来吊打。但在被枪杀的时候，这位英勇不屈的钱宗英烈士高呼：“毛主席万岁！”
    宋公园、虹口公园、中兴路普球消防实验场，这些都是匪徒们杀人如麻的半公开刑场。不管是白天或是黑夜，每当飞行堡垒由马路上驶过的时候，人们的心便紧缩起来。刑场附近的市民必须家家关门闭户，不准张望，罪犯们是如此凶残，又如此害怕被人看见他们手上的血迹，但是市民从门缝中偷偷瞧着，看见一批批工人、学生高呼着口号，慷慨就义。五月十二日，中兴路刑场上有三个临刑的工人高喊“我们是为爱国呀！”特务们于是又把被害者的眼睛蒙上，把他们的嘴巴塞住，后来索性把他们反扎着手脚，塞入麻袋，投进黄浦江。这个在夜晚秘密进行屠杀的数字，谁也弄不清楚，仅能从江中捞出一部分尚未漂走的浮尸知道一二。到了五月二十二日，更多的人被捕了，仅仅几小时就被押上刑场了。
    　　　　“一律杀光”
    杀人魔王毛森的口号是要“打碎”和“毁灭”上海。直到五月二十四日的黄昏，他还继续着这个血腥的屠杀。当解放军已经从西郊进入市区时，毛森在逃跑之前，还亲率卫队在警察局的天井内一下枪杀了九个“政治犯”，其中有两个是他的部下，然后，带着一伙帮凶，在黑暗中悄悄地溜走了。战犯毛森没有想到解放军来得这么快，只匆匆忙忙地下了一道命令：“情势突变，一律杀光”。威海卫路伪警备司令部稽查大队的三十余名革命“政治犯”，眼睛已被扎上黑布了，专等囚车开来执刑。恰恰就在这时，解放军攻入了上海市区，把这批“政治犯”解放了！杀人犯的时候从此一去不复返了！伪保密局的黄埔监狱、伪警察总局、上海监狱……战犯们都来不及“一律杀光了”！
    军管会接管了伪警局及伪法院后，仅仅法院及警察总局、蓬莱、黄浦、提蓝桥等三个分局已有二七三名共产党员、工人、学生、民主爱国人士以及许多市民被欢迎出狱。
    毛森等杀人魔王所留下的这笔血债，是上海人民永远忘不了的。上海人民一定要为那些被反革命特务分子所杀害的革命战士和人民报仇，追到天涯海角，也要把毛森等杀人犯一个个捉拿法办！
