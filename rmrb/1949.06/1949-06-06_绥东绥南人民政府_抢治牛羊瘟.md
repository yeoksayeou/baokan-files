　　Sui Dong and Sui Nan People's Government
  　Actively Treats Cattle and Sheep Plague
    [Sui Meng Telegram] Cattle and sheep plague has been discovered in some areas of Sui Dong and Sui Nan. The government is actively seeking treatment methods. In the second, fourth, fifth, and tenth districts of Xinghe in Sui Dong, cattle plague was discovered in mid-May. Five cattle have died in the Lama Camp in the fifth district, and two cattle have died in Baijia Camp. The symptoms are of two types: 1. After becoming ill, the cattle do not eat grass or chew, only drink water and have diarrhea, and die after two or three days. 2. After becoming ill, the cattle do not eat grass or urinate, their limbs are stretched straight, and they die from bloating. According to veterinarians, the cattle plague is caused by drought. In the Huhongqi area of Jining in Sui Dong, sheep plague occurred as early as the beginning of April. So far, more than 4,000 sheep have died, accounting for almost 25 percent of the total number of sheep in the banner. Jilamen, a Mongolian herder in the Eighth Sumu, raised 50 sheep and 40 of them have died. At the same time, in some villages along the Honghe River in Helin, Sui Nan, the sheep plague is also serious. Half of the more than 200 sheep in the Dongtouhao Village have died. The condition is that when they are released from the pen, they urinate a black and purple blood and then die. When the abdomen is opened, the intestines contain light white water mixed with thin manure, and the lungs are somewhat swollen. In addition to sending veterinarians to treat the above diseases, the local government has also announced them in the local newspaper and introduced treatment methods.

　　绥东绥南人民政府
  　抢治牛羊瘟
    【绥蒙电】绥东绥南部分地区发现牛羊瘟，政府已积极设法治疗。绥东兴和二、四、五、十区，于五月中旬发现牛瘟，五区喇嘛营已死牛五头，白家营死牛两头，其病状有两种：一、得病后不吃草不咀嚼，光喝水拉稀，两三天后即死去。二、得病后不吃草不撒尿，四肢伸直，肚涨而死。据兽医谈，牛瘟是因天旱引起。绥东集宁户红旗一带，四月初即发生羊瘟，迄今已死羊四千多只，几占全旗羊数百分之二十五。八苏木蒙民吉拉门，养羊五十只，即死掉四十只。同时在绥南和林红河两岸部分村庄，羊瘟亦严重发生，东头号村二百多只已死了一半。病况是从圈内放出来尿一股黑紫血后就死倒，剥开肚看，肠子里有淡白水和稀粪在一起，肺有些肿胀。以上诸病，当地政府除派兽医治疗外，并在当地报上公布，同时介绍治疗方法。
