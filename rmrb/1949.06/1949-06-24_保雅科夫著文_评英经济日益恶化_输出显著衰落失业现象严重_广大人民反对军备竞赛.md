Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, June 23rd: Moscow Dispatch: *Pravda* recently published an article by Polyakov commenting on the British economic situation, stating that the Labour Party's annual conference, which recently concluded in Blackpool, was largely characterized by the deterioration of the country's economic situation. The reduction of British exports, the contraction of industrial production, and the increasing depletion of industrial equipment have been proven facts. In April and May of this year, British exports clearly turned downward. The decline in exports means that large-scale unemployment is once again knocking on Britain's door, and imports of food and raw materials will also decrease accordingly.

Polyakov emphasized that Britain used only a negligible portion of American loans and Marshall Plan funds to purchase basic construction equipment. Why hasn't Britain done anything serious to re-equip its industry in these four years? This is because the vast majority of the funds that could have been used to re-equip industry have been swallowed up by the arms race caused by the Labour government's domestic and foreign policies.

Polyakov pointed out that under the guise of "permanent friendship and union" between the United States and Britain, the intense struggle for world markets is becoming increasingly acute. In this struggle, Britain is not only suffering blows from the United States but is also trying to fight back against its rivals. A recent effort in this direction is the British government's attempt to intensify exports to the United States. However, it is at least doubtful whether this policy will succeed. The fact is that the American economy has passed its post-war peak and is clearly heading towards a crisis.

The author concludes that the British ruling group is demanding new sacrifices from the people to promote their adventurous policies.

However, broad sections of the British people are increasingly loudly demanding an end to the insane arms race that is draining the country's energy. The British people are increasingly clearly seeing that the Labour leaders' domestic and foreign policies are policies that serve the "City" of London and Wall Street, and are policies that are hostile to the interests of the broad masses.

    评英经济日益恶化
    输出显著衰落失业现象严重
    广大人民反对军备竞赛
    【新华社北平二十三日电】莫斯科讯：真理报顷刊载保雅科夫评英国经济局势的论文称：最近在布拉克普尔闭幕的工党年会，在很大程度上是以国家经济状况的恶化为其特点的。英国输出的减少、工业生产的缩减和工业装备的日益耗损已为事实所证明。本年四、五两月中，英国出口显然地转向衰落。输出的减少意味着大批失业又已在敲着英国的大门，而食品和原料的输入亦将随之减少。
    保雅科夫强调称：英国只用了美国贷款和马歇尔计划基金中微不足道的一部分，来购买基本建设装备。为什么在这四年中英国没有认真作些事情去重新装备它的工业呢？这是由于绝大部分能够用于重新装备工业的款项，都被工党政府的内外政策所引起的军备竞赛吞没了。
    保雅科夫指出：在美国与英国的“永久的友谊和联合”的假面具下，争夺世界市场的紧张斗争正越来越尖锐。在这个斗争中，英国不只遭受美国方面来的打击，同时也试图还击他的敌手。最近在这一方向的努力，就是英国政府企图加紧对美国的输出。但是，至少也可以说，这个政策之能否成功是极可怀疑的。事实是，美国经济已经走过了战后的高峰，而且显然在走向危机。
    作者结语称：英国统治集团要求人民作新的牺牲，以推进他们的冒险政策。
    但是英国人民的广泛阶层日益响亮地要求结束吮吸国家精力的疯狂的军备竞赛。英国人民日益清楚地看到，工党领袖的内政外交政策是服务于伦敦“城”和华尔街的政策，是和广大群众利益敌对的政策。
