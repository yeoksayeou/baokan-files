　　Taihang, Southern Hebei, Central Hebei, Eastern Hebei and other places
  　Seize the opportunity to vigorously eliminate locust nymphs
    [Report from this newspaper] Since the beginning of June, locust nymphs have successively appeared in Taihang, Southern Hebei, Central Hebei, and Eastern Hebei. Thanks to the vigilance and organized prevention by leaders at all levels, the pest infestation was contained and eliminated before it could spread in most areas. Some places are now vigorously organizing to swat them. According to news from the first, fourth, and fifth administrative offices of Taihang, the counties along the Pinghan Railway such as Yuanshi, Gaoyi, Wu'an, and Chengci are more seriously affected, and the counties of Bo'ai, Jiaozuo, Huixian, and Xinxiang in the fourth administrative region of Taihang have also been affected. The Taihang Administrative Office has issued an urgent instruction, ordering governments at all levels to quickly establish and improve locust control command organizations, carry out intensive swatting, and concentrate technical personnel and sprayers to use the newly purchased 500 jin of sodium fluoride in the areas most severely affected by the locust plague. It will also allocate 12,000 jin of millet to the fourth and fifth administrative regions and 1,000 jin of millet to the first administrative region to reward cadres and masses who have contributed to locust control. Currently, just in the four villages of Wannian, Liaocun, Zhangye, and Zhaocun in the fourth district of Yuanshi, 1,900 people were mobilized on the 7th and 8th alone, eliminating locust nymphs on 1,900 mu of land. It is estimated that the locust nymphs can be completely eliminated in three days. Other places such as Shahe, Jiaozuo, and Wuxiang are also eliminating them as soon as they are discovered. After locusts were discovered in Shenze, Raoyang, Xianxian and other places in central Hebei, the Central Hebei District Party Committee and the Administrative Office successively issued urgent instructions. County Party committees, governments, and mass organization cadres went to the countryside to lead the masses in locust control, and various places are carrying out intensive efforts. Shenxian has reorganized the wheat protection committee into a locust control committee to specifically lead the swatting. In southern Hebei, according to reports from only the Third Prefectural Committee, locust nymphs have been found in 128 villages in eight counties including Daming, Handan, Yongnian, and Linzhang. Due to the ideological paralysis of cadres, some local cadres returned home for the wheat harvest and did not take precautions in advance. After the locust infestation was discovered, they failed to organize forces to swat them in time. The administrative office and prefectural committee have issued urgent instructions, calling on all counties to immediately organize locust control headquarters, organize the masses, concentrate forces regardless of district, village, or land boundaries, and quickly eliminate them. They have also transferred 157 cadres to various counties to help lead. On the 7th alone, Daming mobilized 10,000 people with the slogan "Swatting locusts is like fighting a fire" to actively swat them. The second district of the county has eliminated seven-tenths of them, and the first district has also swatted them once. The director of the Agricultural Office of the Eastern Hebei Administrative Office personally led the pest control team to the locust-affected area to lead locust control. The Eastern Hebei Pest Control Team of the Agricultural Department of the North China People's Government also participated in the pest control work. In Luanxian, 14 villages had more than 2,600 people swatting locusts every day, and they captured more than 10,400 jin of locust nymphs in four days. In this locust control campaign, the following experiences have been gained in various places: (1) Leaders at all levels must be sufficiently vigilant, not be paralyzed, not wait, and vigorously lead the masses to actively swat them, exchange experiences at any time, and reward models. (2) The locust control command organization must always grasp the locust nymph situation in the entire area, plan to mobilize labor, check tools, discover and swat them at any time, and prevent the occurrence of other pests, trying to ensure that production is not delayed and locust nymphs can be quickly eliminated. (3) Pay attention to scouting the places where flying locusts have landed in previous years, and mobilize the masses to dig up eggs. In areas where they may be found, do not be negligent. Be vigilant at all times, be fully prepared, organize forces, and eliminate them on the spot once discovered.

　　太行冀南冀中冀东等地
  　抓紧时机大力灭蝻
    【本报讯】太行、冀南、冀中、冀东等地六月初以来，相继发生蝗蝻。由于各级领导事先有所警惕，组织防范，大部地区虫害未及蔓延即被捕灭，有些地方现正大力组织扑打中。据太行一、四、五三个专署消息，平汉沿线元氏、高邑、武安、成磁等县较为严重，太行四专区的博爱、焦作、辉县、新乡等县也已发生。太行行署现已发出紧急指示，令各级政府迅速建立和健全剿蝗指挥机构，突击捕灭，并集中技术人员与喷雾器，将新购买之五百斤氟酸钠集中于蝗灾最严重地区使用，并拨给四、五专区小米一万二千斤，一专区小米一千斤，奖励打蝗有功的干部与群众。现仅元氏四区万年、聊村、张掖、赵村等四村在七、八两日即动员了一千九百人，消灭蝗蝻一千九百亩，估计三天时间即可将蝗蝻完全消灭。其他如沙河、焦作、武乡等地也都随时发现随时消灭。冀中深泽、饶阳、献县等地发现蝗虫后，冀中区党委和行署先后发出紧急指示，各县县委、政府、群众团体干部纷纷下乡领导群众捕蝗，各地正紧张突击中。深县已将护麦委员会，改组为捕蝗委员会，专门领导扑打。冀南仅据三地委汇报，大名、邯郸、永年、临漳等八县有一百二十八个村发现蝗蝻。由于干部思想麻痹，有的地方干部麦收回家，事先未做防范，发现蝗情后未能及早组织力量扑打。专署、地委已分别发出紧急指示，号召各县立即组织剿蝗指挥部，组织群众，集中力量不分区、村、土地界限，迅速扑灭。并抽调干部一百五十七名分赴各县帮助领导，仅七日一天，大名即动员了一万人以“扑蝗如救火”之行动口号，积极捕打，该县二区已消灭十分之七，一区也都扑打一遍。冀东行署农业处长亲率除虫队，赴虫灾区领导剿蝗，华北人民政府农业部冀东除虫队也参加治虫工作，滦县十四个村每天二千六百余人捕打，四天捕捉蝗蝻一万零四百余斤。在这次灭蝗运动中，各地已得出如下经验：（一）各级领导一定要有足够警惕，不麻痹、不等待，大力领导群众积极扑灭，随时交换经验，奖励模范。（二）剿蝗指挥机构要时刻掌握全区蝗蝻情况，有计划的调动劳力，检查工具，随时发现，随时扑打，并预防其他虫害之发生，尽量做到既不误生产又可迅速消灭蝗蝻。（三）要注意侦察前几年落过飞蝗的地方，发动群众刨卵。在可能发现的地区，切勿麻痹大意，要时刻侦察，充分准备，组织力量，发现后就地消灭。
