Xinhua News Agency, Peiping, June 21st: TASS, Rome, June 19th: The Central People's Petition Committee, which is directing the signature campaign of the Italian people against the North Atlantic Treaty, recently issued a notice regarding the imminent parliamentary discussion on the ratification of the North Atlantic Treaty. It urges local committees to collect petition signatures and requests collectors to work more actively. The notice points out that delegations from local and provincial areas will deliver lists with millions of signatures to Rome next week to present a petition to the Speaker of the Lower House. According to "Unità," more than 470,000 signatures have been collected in the city and province of Milan. The signature campaign is still ongoing. Senator Trascini told a reporter from "Unità" that the government is accelerating the ratification of the North Atlantic Treaty, not only to curry favor with American imperialists, but also to force activists supporting the petition movement against the ratification of the Atlantic Treaty to cease their signature collection campaign, as this movement has produced results beyond the government's expectations.

    【新华社北平二十一日电】塔斯社罗马十九日讯：主持意大利人民反对北大西洋公约签名运动的中央人民请愿委员会，顷就议会即将讨论批准北大西洋公约问题发表公告，敦促各地方委员会征集请愿签名，要求征集人更积极地努力。公告指出：地方和省的代表团将在下星期把数百万人签名的名单送到罗马向下院议长提出请愿。团结报称，在米兰市和米兰省，已征集了四十七万多人的签名。征集签名运动仍在继续中。参议员特拉西尼告团结报记者称：政府正加速使北大西洋公约获得批准，不仅是为了博得美帝国主义分子的青睐，而且也是为了迫使支持反对批准大西洋公约的请愿运动的积极分子中止征集签名运动，因为这一运动已产生了出乎政府意外的结果。
