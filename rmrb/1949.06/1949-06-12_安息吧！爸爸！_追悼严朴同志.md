　　Rest in Peace, Father!
  　In Memory of Comrade Yan Pu
    Yan Ping
    Father has passed away, a loyal Party member and a loyal servant of the people will sleep forever. I am deeply saddened because I have not only lost a loving father but also a respectable mentor and a dear comrade.
    I was only a month old when my father was wanted by the counter-revolutionaries and forced to leave home, so I didn't know what my father looked like. It wasn't until the early days of the Anti-Japanese War, when I arrived in Xi'an and saw my father at the Eighth Route Army office, that I recognized him and began to be a child with a father. At that time, I was already a student who had graduated from elementary school.
    My father and I were not often together, but whenever there was a chance to meet, he would always earnestly educate me: "Study hard!" "Be loyal to the Party and serve the people wholeheartedly!" "Work diligently for the Party. Whatever work the Party assigns to you, you should put all your efforts into it, without being lazy or haggling!" "Live frugally, and always remember the people; we are here to serve them!"
    In this spirit, my father abandoned everything from his landlord family. To realize his lofty ideals, he worked diligently for the Party and the people for twenty-five years. Now that my father has fallen, I can no longer see his patient, cautious, tireless, and hardworking figure. But my father's selfless, public-spirited, and self-disciplined spirit and style are deeply engraved in my heart, and they will always be the force driving me forward!
    Father, you did not live to see the day of national victory and unfortunately left us. We will inherit your will and style and vow to serve the people to the end!
    Rest in peace, Father. We will certainly be loyal to the Party and the cause of the people, and work wholeheartedly.

　　安息吧！爸爸！
  　追悼严朴同志
    严苹
    爸爸死了，一位忠于党和忠于人民的老人常眠不起了。我万分悲伤，因为我不仅是失去了慈祥的父亲，并且失去了可敬的导师，失去了亲爱的同志。
    爸爸被反革命通缉，被迫离家时，我才满月，因此我根本不知道父亲的容貌，直到抗战初期，我到达西安，在八路军办事处，见到爸爸，我才认识了爸爸，我才开始是一个有父亲的孩子，那时我已经是高小毕业的学生了。
    爸爸不常与我在一块，但只要有见面的机会，他常谆谆然教育我：“好好学习！”“要忠心耿耿为党为人民服务！”“勤勤恳恳为党工作，只要是党分配给你的工作，便应该拿出全力来干，不偷懒，不讲价钱！”“生活要刻苦，要时刻记着老百姓，我们是为他们服务！”
    本着这种精神，父亲抛开了地主家庭的一切，为了实现自己崇高的理想，他勤勤恳恳为党为人民工作了二十五年。如今爸爸倒下了，我再不能见到他耐心、谨慎、不知疲劳、不辞辛苦地工作的姿态了，但爸爸大公无私，刻己奉公的精神与作风，深深烙在我的心里，它将永远成为鞭策我奋勇前进的力量！
    爸爸，您没有活到全国胜利的日子，不幸地离开我们了，我们将继承您的遗志遗风，誓为人民服务到底！
    安息吧！爸爸，我们一定忠于党、忠于人民的事业、全心全意工作。
