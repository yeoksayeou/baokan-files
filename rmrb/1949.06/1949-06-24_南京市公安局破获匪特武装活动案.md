Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, 23rd: The Nanjing Public Security Bureau cracked two cases of Kuomintang bandit-spy armed activities in late May. The main criminals, Wang Zhengqing, Ma Yingjie, and Tao Wensheng, have all been arrested. These bandits were directed by Chiang Kai-shek's son, Chiang Ching-kuo. A week before the Kuomintang retreated from Nanjing, Wang and Ma, under the leadership of Chiang Ching-kuo, organized the so-called "Youth National Salvation Volunteer Corps," planning to carry out sabotage activities after our army liberated Nanjing. On April 20th, taking advantage of the chaotic social order before our army entered Nanjing, Wang Zhengqing and others robbed forty rifles and pistols from the No. 60 Arsenal outside Zhonghua Gate, and gathered disbanded soldiers and ruffians, illegally operating under the name of the so-called "Chinese People's Revolutionary Army Jiangnan Corps Jingwu Area Southern Anhui Region Provisional Fifth Regiment." After the Nanjing Public Security Bureau learned of the above situation, it quickly arrested the main criminals Wang Zhengqing and Ma Yingjie, and seized 19 guns and various forged official seals, stamps, and letters of appointment. Another criminal, Tao Wensheng, after our army arrived in Nanjing, used false pretenses such as the "Yangtze River Transportation Headquarters Transportation Brigade" to carry out activities to undermine revolutionary order. All the above main criminals are currently under interrogation.
