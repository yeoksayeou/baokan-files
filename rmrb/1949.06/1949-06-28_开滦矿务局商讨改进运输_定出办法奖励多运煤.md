　　【Tangshan Electric Dispatch】 In order to strengthen the output of Kailuan coal and improve railway operation efficiency, Yang Wenqin, the military representative of the Tianjin Kailuan Mining Bureau, and Wang Lin, the military representative of the Tangshan Kailuan Mining Bureau, convened a meeting on the 15th of this month at the Linxi Mine. The meeting was attended by worker representatives from the three eastern mines of Kailuan (Linxi, Zhaogezhuang, Tangjiazhuang), administrative leaders of the transportation department, railway worker representatives, and mine representatives to discuss improving transportation work. After discussion based on the specific situation, it was considered that: First, there must be consistent pace, otherwise, in the entire transportation process, any link that is negligent or slow, whether it is driving, hooking, or loading coal, will affect the entire transportation plan and affect the early departure of vehicles from the factory. Second, workers must unite. Under the requirement of strengthening transportation, any management personnel who are not active or responsible in scheduling and individual workers who do not obey orders should be criticized. At the meeting, workers also discussed with the mine management the bonus method for transportation workers. It was decided to set the following standards based on daily driving standards: the standard transport volume for Linxi is 5,200 tons (including washed coal), 5,200 tons for Zhaogezhuang, and 3,800 tons for Tangjiazhuang. If the standard transport volume is reached, first-class workers (drivers, stokers, hooking workers) will receive an increase of 1.5 jiao in their base salary, second-class workers (coal weighers, spotters, car prodders) will receive an increase of 1 jiao in their base salary, and third-class workers (car labelers, track switchers, flag wavers) will receive an increase of 5 fen in their base salary. Thereafter, for every 2.5 percent exceeding the standard transport volume, the increase will be raised one level, such as increasing from 1.5 jiao to 3 jiao.

　　开滦矿务局商讨改进运输
  　定出办法奖励多运煤
    【唐山电】为加强开滦煤的输出，提高铁路运转效率，天津开滦矿务局军代表杨文钦和唐山开滦矿务局军代表王林，特于本月十五日，在林西矿召集开滦东三矿（林西、赵各庄、唐家庄）职工代表及运输部门行政负责人，铁路职工代表，矿方代表开会，商讨改进运输工作。根据具体情况进行讨论，认为：第一要步调一致，不然在全部运输过程中，不管是开车的，挂钩的、装煤的，任何一个环节疏忽、怠慢，都会牵动全部运输计划，影响车辆早出厂。第二要职工团结，在加强运输的要求下，任何管理人员在调度上不积极不负责和个别工人不听指挥都应当受到批评。会上工人并和矿方讨论了运输工人奖励金的办法。决定根据日常行车标准定出：林西的标准运输量为五二○○吨（洗煤在内），赵各庄也是五二○○吨，唐家庄三八○○吨。如果达到标准运输量时，一类工人（开车、烧火、挂钩的工人）增加底薪一毛五，二类工人（秤煤、放眼、撬车的工人）增加底薪一毛，三类工人（贴车牌、搬道、打旗的工人）增加底薪五分，以后每超过标准运输量百分之二点五，即增进一级，如一毛五的增加为三毛。
