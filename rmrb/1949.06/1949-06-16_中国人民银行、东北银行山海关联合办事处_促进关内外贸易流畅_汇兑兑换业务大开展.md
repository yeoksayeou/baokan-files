　　People's Bank of China, Northeast Bank Shanhaiguan Joint Office
    Promoting Smooth Trade Inside and Outside the Customs
    Greatly Expanding Remittance and Exchange Business
    [Shanhaiguan News] The Shanhaiguan Joint Office of the People's Bank of China and the Northeast Bank has greatly expanded its remittance and exchange business. In March, April, and May, in addition to exchanging and settling 1.564 billion yuan of Renminbi and 390.5 billion yuan of Northeast currency for trade and travelers between North China and the Northeast, it also settled remittances between North China and the Northeast amounting to 268.8 billion yuan of Northeast currency and over 740 million yuan of Renminbi. This greatly stabilized prices in North China and the Northeast, enhanced the credibility of currencies in both regions, and further facilitated trade between the two regions. In the remittance business, remittances from the Northeast accounted for 60%, and those from North China accounted for 40%. The exchange business started on March 3rd. Due to transportation limitations and insufficient personnel in March, only 172 million yuan of Renminbi and 99.7 billion yuan of Northeast currency were exchanged. By May, with the restoration of transportation and smooth trade, the exchange volume in May alone reached 880 million yuan of Renminbi, exceeding March's volume by five times, and 198 billion yuan of Northeast currency, exceeding March's volume by two times. The remittance business started on April 1st and is gradually expanding. For the sake of centralized allocation of funds, the current remittance locations are temporarily set at Shenyang, Jinzhou, Tianjin, Beiping, and Tangshan.
    Since the direct passenger train between Beiping and Shenyang resumed on May 1st, in order to further facilitate currency exchange for travelers, the office has set up an exchange office inside the station. Passenger trains only need to stop for twenty or fifty minutes to exchange all the travelers' currency, which is convenient for the travelers.
