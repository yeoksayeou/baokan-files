　　【Jidong News】The Luan River transportation industry is gradually recovering and developing. According to statistics from villages along the Luan River in Qianxi County in late May, forty-two wooden boats have resumed transportation. The area of this county is poor, with little land and many mountains, producing timber and fruits, relying on the Luan River to export products and import food. At that time, there were more than 1,000 boat households and more than 400 wooden boats of various sizes in the county; after the Anti-Japanese War, they were devastated by the Japanese invaders, and most of the transportation was stopped. After the Japanese surrendered, they were sabotaged by the Kuomintang bandits, and most of the boat people lost their jobs. In view of this situation, the Jidong Administrative Office allocated 140 million yuan in Changcheng currency for boat industry loans in March, which were distributed to 90 boat households. Each household actively repaired old boats and built new boats. Guo Gou Village in the first district repaired the original five broken boats and built two new boats. Bai Gou Village received 3,750 jin of loan rice and 550 jin of repair fees (converted from currency) and repaired the four damaged wooden boats. It also bought two broken boats, repaired them, and replaced all of them with new sails. As of the end of May, forty-two jujube-core-shaped wooden boats have successively resumed river transport (most of them are owned by three or two households). According to the current water volume, each boat carries 5,000 to 4,000 jin. The general freight rate is four jin of millet per hundred jin per hundred li. According to the current incomplete statistics, the total freight income of the boat households is 79,000 jin of millet and 7,500 jin of corn, greatly reducing the famine situation.

　　四十二只木船下水　迁西船运渐恢复
    【冀东讯】滦河运输业日趋恢复发展，仅迁西县滦河沿岸村庄据五月下旬统计，已有四十二只木船恢复运输。该县地区贫乏，地少山多，产木料果品，依靠滦河输出产品运入食粮。当时全县计有船户一千余家，大小木船四百余只；抗战后受日寇摧残，运输大部停顿，日降后又遭国民党匪帮破坏，船民大部失业。据此情况冀东行署于三月份特拨船业贷款长城币一亿四千万元，发放给九十家船户，各户遂积极修补旧船制新船。一区郭沟村将原有五只破船修补好外，并另钉新船两只。白沟村领得贷米三千七百五十斤及修理费米五百五十斤（以款折实）将破损了的四只木船修好，另又买来两只破船修好，全部换上新帆。截至五月底为止，已有四十二只枣核型木船先后恢复河运（多数是三两家一只）。根据目前水量每船载重五千斤至四千斤，一般运费每百里每百斤小米四斤，据现在不完全统计，各船户得运费合计小米七万九千斤，苞米七千五百斤。大大减弱粮荒灾情。
