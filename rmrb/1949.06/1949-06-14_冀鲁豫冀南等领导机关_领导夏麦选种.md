　　The leadership organs of Hebei-Shandong-Henan, Taiyue, and Southern Hebei are actively guiding farmers in summer wheat seed selection. The Hebei-Shandong-Henan Administrative Office, in order to promote superior varieties, issued instructions separately after the wheat harvest and allocated multiple batches of grain for seed selection purposes, designating Qingfeng, Hebei, and other places to meticulously select 800,000 jin of wheat seeds from the *Youzi* wheat and alkaline wheat areas that were promoted in the past. At the same time, 250,000 jin of "438" wheat seeds were designated to be meticulously selected on the south bank of the Yellow River. After experiments and promotion by farms, it has been proven that *Youzi* wheat and "438" wheat are high-yielding, produce more flour, mature early, have strong resistance to *dan* (disease), and have strong and non-lodging stalks; alkaline wheat has strong alkali resistance. The Administrative Office has now sent 25 promotion teams to Qingfeng to assist in seed selection and promotion. The Agricultural Department of the Southern Hebei Administrative Office has also sent three wheat seed selection work teams to Linqing, Guangzong, Wei County, and other places to guide seed selection. The Linqing work team also introduced two seed selection methods: in-field seed selection requires removing mixed ears, and setting up special threshing grounds for beating "Fish Scale White" (a superior variety, which the government is prepared to purchase at a high price for promotion). In some villages in the seventh district of Jin City, Taiyue, because seed selection or seed soaking and disinfection were not carried out during wheat planting last year, coupled with late planting and insufficient fertilizer application, the resistance to cold and disease was weak, resulting in very serious mold damage this year. For example, in more than 20 villages such as Xialiuchuan and Qiuquan, more than 20,000 mu of wheat were damaged by mold, accounting for 40% of the total wheat land. Calculating the wheat yield at six *dou* per mu, the harvest will be reduced by more than 6,000 *shi*. Therefore, summer wheat seed selection must be carried out seriously.

　　冀鲁豫冀南等领导机关
  　领导夏麦选种
    【本报讯】冀鲁豫、太岳、冀南等地领导机关，积极导领农民进行夏麦选种工作。冀鲁豫行署为推广优良品种，在麦收完成后，曾分别发出指示，并拨多批粮食作为选种用途，指定河北清丰等地在蚰子麦、碱麦过去推广区精选麦种八十万斤；同时指定黄河南岸精选“四三八”麦种二十五万斤。经农场试验与推广结果，证明蚰子麦与“四三八”小麦均为多产麦、多出面、早熟、抗疸（病）性强、秆硬不倒；碱麦抗碱强性。现行署已派推广组二十五人，到清丰帮助选种及推广工作。冀南行署农业处，亦派三个小麦选种工作组，分赴临清、广宗、威县等地领导选种。临清工作组还介绍了选种的两个办法：即在地里选种要把杂穗去掉，并专设打“鱼鳞白”（优良品种，政府准备高价收买，以便推广）的麦场，太岳晋城七区有些村因为去年种麦时没经过选种或浸种消毒。再加上种的迟上粪少，而抗寒抗病力弱，使今年霉麦非常严重，如下犁川、秋泉等二十多个村，共霉坏麦子两万多亩，占全部麦地的百分之四十，每亩麦以六斗收成计算，要减少收成六千多石。因之，夏麦选种工作必须认真进行。
