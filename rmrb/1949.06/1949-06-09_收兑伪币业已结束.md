Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 8th -- The redemption of counterfeit "Gold Yuan Certificates" in Shanghai ended on the 5th. A total of 359,789,900+ RMB yuan were redeemed, involving 221,500+ people. The people of Shanghai were one of the main targets of the Kuomintang bandit gang's frantic plunder and exploitation through the issuance of counterfeit currency before liberation. Until just before liberation, Chiang Kai-shek's bandits even forced the original Central Printing Plant to rush-print 1 million and 5 million yuan bills, and had even designed a 10 million yuan denomination. Thanks to the rapid advance of the People's Liberation Army, six million people were saved from the disaster of the counterfeit currency collapsing.

　　收兑伪币业已结束
    【新华社上海八日电】上海市收兑伪金圆券已于五日结束，共兑出人民币三亿五千九百七十八万九千九百余元，兑换者共二十二万一千五百余人。上海人民在解放前为国民党匪帮发行伪币进行疯狂掠夺、榨取的主要对象之一，直到解放前夕蒋匪还迫令原中央印制厂赶印一百万元和五百万元大钞，并已设计一千万元票面。由于人民解放军的神速推进，六百万人民才得脱离伪币崩溃的灾难。
