Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, 18th. Sources from the Kuomintang-controlled areas of Gansu reported that teachers and students in Lanzhou, Wuwei, Tianshui, Pingliang, and other places launched strikes and demonstrations against hunger, conscription, and extortion in March and April. On March 29th, students from Gansu Province attending Northwest Normal College, Lanzhou University, Agricultural College, Veterinary College, and other schools jointly held a demonstration against the fraudulent Gansu Provincial Government's extortion of three million silver dollars from the people of Gansu under the guise of "construction bonds." Teachers, staff and students of the First and Second Normal Schools in Wuwei held a demonstration on April 25th to protest the county magistrate, Wang, for embezzling student rations and public funds, and the Bandit 246th Division for forcibly conscripting 400 young men. The puppet county government incited military police to open fire, wounding four students. Angry students from various schools then held a second demonstration on the morning of the 27th. In late April, teachers, staff and students from primary and secondary schools in Tianshui held a five-day strike against hunger. All teachers and staff of Pingliang Longdong Normal School, Pingliang Middle School, Pingliang Girls' Middle School, and Liuhu Normal School went on strike on February 11th due to long-overdue wages.
