Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, 16th. A certain unit of the People's Liberation Army, with the strength of one regiment, killed or wounded more than 2,000 bandits belonging to Ma Bufang's forces in the suburbs of Xianyang on the 13th. Including the troops annihilated by the People's Liberation Army south of Yongshou and north of Qianxian on the 11th, the Ma bandits have lost more than 4,000 soldiers in three days. This time, the bandit armies of Ma Bufang and Ma Hongkui organized the so-called Longdong Corps and Ningxia Corps, dispatching all their forces from Gansu to aid Hu Zongnan's bandit troops in their retreat westward and southward. According to Ma bandit prisoners and surrendered personnel, each squad of the bandit troops was equipped with a sheepskin raft, preparing to cross the Wei River and infiltrate Xi'an. However, in just three days, from the 11th to the 13th, the two Ma bandit armies, together with the troops of Hu Zongnan's bandit army annihilated by the People's Liberation Army southeast of Mei County, have lost nearly 10,000 soldiers. The Ma bandits can only dream of seeing Xi'an.
    Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, 17th. The Kuomintang's remaining bandit gangs hiding in Zhejiang and southern Anhui have surrendered or been annihilated one after another under the People's Liberation Army's suppression and persuasion efforts. In Zhejiang, from May 27th to June 10th, the People's Liberation Army eliminated eleven bandit gangs in fifteen days. More than 4,000 remnant bandits surrendered or were annihilated. Among them, nine bandit gangs, including the 4th, 6th, 8th, and 9th companies of Sun Bo's bandit unit in Chang'an and Mashan areas of Shaoxing County, eastern Zhejiang, a detachment and part of the 4th detachment of the Yin County Self-Defense Corps, the Yinnan District Brigade, the 3rd Brigade of the Shaoxing Self-Defense Corps, the 1st Brigade of the Qiantang River Joint Defense Corps, the Zhejiang Security Assault Team in Tonglu and Jiande, the Tonglu Self-Defense Team, part of the Fuchun River Assault Detachment, and the 1st Detachment of the Anti-Communist National Salvation Corps in southern Zhejiang, totaling more than 3,660 people, surrendered their weapons collectively one after another. In addition, more than 348 bandits from Zhao Songxiu, He Buhui, and others in Hengshan and Chencaishi, southeast of Zhuji, were annihilated. Currently, only a few bandit gangs remain entrenched in the mountainous areas of eastern Zhejiang, and the People's Liberation Army's suppression forces are continuing to expand their offensive in conjunction with the local people.
    In addition, several hundred Kuomintang straggler bandits who roamed Qingyang and other places in southern Anhui surrendered or were annihilated in May. Those who surrendered included all 540+ members of the Kuomintang Self-Defense Regiments of Dongliu and Guichi counties. Those who attempted to resist and were annihilated included the Anhui Provincial Security 6th Regiment of the Kuomintang bandit army and the Western Anhui Self-Defense Army and other bandit gangs in Dongliu, Qingyang, and other counties, totaling more than 400 people.
