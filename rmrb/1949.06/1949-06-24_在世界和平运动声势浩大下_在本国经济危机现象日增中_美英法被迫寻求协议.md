    Amidst the Swelling Tide of the World Peace Movement
    And with the Rising Economic Crisis at Home
    US, Britain, and France are Forced to Seek Agreement
    The representatives of Western countries have adopted a negative stance toward the suggestions made by the Soviet Union regarding the fundamental issues of Germany. However, there is no possibility of a breakdown in negotiations. They are willing to seek agreement on some current German-related issues and the Austrian peace treaty. Journalists closely following the conference's progress point out that there are two reasons for this change in tactics by the Western representatives: First, the ruling groups of Western countries cannot but consider the obvious fact that the powerful movement to defend peace and oppose warmongers, a movement led by the Soviet Union, is growing stronger worldwide. If the Western representatives were to break down these negotiations, which have the responsibility of guaranteeing peace in Europe, they would expose themselves as blatant accomplices of war provocateurs in the eyes of the people of all countries (including their own). Second, the representatives of Western countries also cannot but consider that the phenomenon of brewing economic crisis in their countries is increasing daily.
    The Soviet delegation has consistently adhered to the policy of consolidating international cooperation, and even in the final stages of this negotiation, has shown full sincerity and willingness to reach agreement on even limited economic issues concerning Germany and the Austrian peace treaty. The Soviet delegation put forward some concrete proposals that ultimately made an agreement possible.
    The true significance of the agreement reached in Paris lies first in the fact that it marks a major step towards restoring the regular activities of the Council of Foreign Ministers. Life itself forces the representatives of Western countries to resume the four-power talks within the framework of the Council of Foreign Ministers. The true significance of the agreement reached at the Paris Foreign Ministers' Conference also lies in the fact that, because the conference's agreement contributes to reducing international tensions, it thereby opens up the path to resolving the fundamental tasks upon which the Council of Foreign Ministers was established. Here, we are referring to the conclusion of peace treaties after the war. In particular, this agreement provides an opportunity to draft the final draft of the Austrian peace treaty in a short period of time, thereby taking a major step towards postwar peace in Europe. Due to the agreement reached, the Soviet delegation's proposal at the Paris Conference to set a date for a foreign ministers' conference with Chinese participation to discuss the Japanese peace treaty has greater reality. Finally, the true significance of the Foreign Ministers' Conference agreement also lies in the fact that it clearly shows that when the command method is no longer used in the Council of Foreign Ministers, it is possible to reach common agreements. If the reactionaries in the United States fully understand this lesson, it would be of great use to the cause of peace. However, these reactionaries have not yet parted ways with their impossible dream of dominating the world.
    Naturally, it would be too naive to think that the Paris Foreign Ministers' Conference, after a year and a half of interrupted work, would immediately resolve all the major issues on the agenda, especially since three of the four member states have not expressed a willingness to reach an agreement on the fundamental issues of Germany. However, despite all this, one should not underestimate the importance of the Paris talks, in the course of which not only were the positions of all parties determined, but also preliminary agreements were reached. The extent to which these positive results of the Paris Conference will affect the future work of the Council of Foreign Ministers will be demonstrated in the future.

    在世界和平运动声势浩大下
    在本国经济危机现象日增中
    美英法被迫寻求协议
    西方国家代表们对苏联所提有关德国基本问题的建议，采取否定的立场，但是，却没有破裂谈判的可能。他们愿意在眼前的一些关系德国的问题和对奥和约的问题上寻求协议。密切注意会议进程的报界人士指出，西方代表们策略上的这种改变，其原因有二：第一、西方国家的统治集团不能不考虑到明显的事实，即强大的保卫和平与反对战争贩子的运动，这一以苏联为首的运动，在全世界声势日益浩大。西方国家代表们若要破裂这次有责任保证欧洲缔造和平的谈判，就将在全世界一切国家人民（包括他们本国人民）的面前，暴露他们是战争挑拨者的公然的伙党。第二、西方国家的代表们还不能不考虑到，在他们国家里，酝酿中的经济危机的现象每天愈来愈多。
    苏联代表团始终如一地坚守巩固国际合作的政策，即令在这次谈判的最后阶段，也表现了充分的诚意，愿意在有关德国的即使是有限的经济问题上和对奥和约问题上获得协议。苏联代表团提出某些具体的建议，这些建议使协议最后成为可能。
    在巴黎所获得之协议的真正意义，首先在于它标志着走向恢复外长会议正规活动的巨大步骤。生活本身迫使西方国家代表恢复外长会议范围内的四国会谈。巴黎外长会议所达协议的真正的意义，也在于，由于会议的协议对减缓国际空气的紧张有所贡献，它从而就打开了解决外长会议之因以建立的基本任务的道路。这里，我们所指的是战后缔订和约。特别说来，这一协议提供了在短时期内拟就对奥和约最后草案的机会，从而就朝着欧洲的战后缔和走了巨大的一步。由于有了所达到的协议，苏联代表团在巴黎会议上所提出的规定一个日期召开有中国参加的外长会议以讨论对日和约问题，就具有了更大的现实性。最后，外长会议协议的真正意义，还在于它灼然可见地显示了，当在外长会议中不再使用命令方法的时候，就有达到共同协议的可能。如果美国的反动分子完全领会了这一教训，那么，这对于和平事业是会有很大用处的。但是，这些反动分子直到现在还没有与他们的不可能实现的统治全世界的梦想分家。
    自然，如果认为在中断了一年半工作之后的巴黎外长会议上，会立即解决议程上的一切重大问题，则这种想法是过于天真的，特别是由于四个会员国中有三国没有表现愿意对德国的基本问题达到协议，就尤其显得天真。但是，尽管有这一切，人们仍不应低估巴黎会谈的重要性，在这一会谈的过程中，不仅是决定了各方面的立场，而且还达到了初步的协议。将来会证明巴黎会议的这些积极的结果，将影响外长会议未来的工作到什么程度。
