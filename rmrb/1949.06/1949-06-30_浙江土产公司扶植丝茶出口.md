Xinhua News Agency, Hangzhou, 29th: The state-owned Zhejiang Native Produce Company is vigorously managing and supporting the province's special products such as silk and tea. Before the establishment of the company's silk department, the Hangzhou Military Control Commission's Trade Department entrusted the original cocoon collection service to begin purchasing spring cocoons, collecting more than 72,500 dan of fresh cocoons from 18 counties and cities in five cocoon collection areas throughout the province. During the purchasing process, cocoon prices were adjusted several times to increase the income and reproductive capacity of silkworm farmers. The company is now planning to allocate a portion of funds as a silkworm seed subsidy for silkworm farmers. To support private silk weaving, the silk department has successively purchased 50 cases of spun silk from Jiaxing Silk Spinning Factory and 40 bolts of foreign cloth from Tianzhang Factory since June, and plans to purchase 2,000 bolts of silk from the Hangzhou Silk Weaving Industry Association. The company's tea department has recently decided to collect and produce 50,000 dan of tea for export, of which 15,000 dan will be self-produced, and the rest will be ordered from private manufacturers, with partial advance payments to encourage tea industry development. The company has sent personnel to tea-producing areas to purchase raw tea, and has rented factory buildings in four locations including Hangzhou to prepare for self-production. 89 manufacturers have applied for orders, and contracts have been signed with 38 of them. The company's oil department is currently collecting and processing rapeseed and rapeseed oil that have already entered the market, and is preparing to successively purchase tung oil and green oil.

Also, to support the silkworm breeding industry in Zhejiang Province, the Hangzhou People's Bank has issued production loans of more than 93.9 million yuan to 54 private silkworm seed manufacturing plants throughout the province.
