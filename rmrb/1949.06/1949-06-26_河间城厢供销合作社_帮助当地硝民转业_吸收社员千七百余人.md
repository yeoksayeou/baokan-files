　　Hejian Chengxiang Supply and Marketing Cooperative
  　Helps Local Saltpeter Producers Switch Professions
  　Absorbs More Than 1,700 Members

    [Hejian News] The Hejian Chengxiang District Supply and Marketing Cooperative has been preliminarily established and has begun to solve the problems of the people's livelihood. The vast majority of residents in Hejian Chengxiang originally made a living by boiling saltpeter. At the end of May this year, the purchase of saltpeter stopped, which will have a certain impact on the future life and production of the saltpeter producers. The County Supply and Marketing Cooperative, based on solving this problem, dispatched certain cadres to help the saltpeter producers switch professions on the one hand, and mobilized the masses in the entire district to establish supply and marketing cooperatives on the other. They started by solving the practical difficulties of the masses and publicizing the benefits of organizing supply and marketing cooperatives. Before the wheat harvest, the people of Chengxiang generally lacked food, and the price was expensive when they bought it at the market. The cadres of the County Supply and Marketing Cooperative immediately grasped the problem and brought in 37,000 jin of millet and 11,050 jin of sorghum from the store, selling it to the masses at a price slightly lower than the market price; and combined it with publicity to make the masses realize the benefits of organizing supply and marketing cooperatives. Wu Luoliang from a township said after listening, "Let's join the cooperative soon! It's not only cheaper than buying things from the Limin Exchange, but it also saves a lot of effort." So he took the lead in buying shares himself, and also motivated 130 people in his township to buy shares. At present, member cooperatives (not engaged in business operations) have been established in thirteen townships, and 1,795 people have been absorbed to subscribe for shares and become members. Among them, the saltpeter producers who subscribed for shares reached 590. Each share is five jin of millet.

    The Hejian Chengxiang Supply and Marketing Cooperative started its establishment in May. According to statistics in the past month, twenty-eight members from three townships who had difficulties in their lives were helped by the cooperative to transport sorghum and millet to other places to sell, earning seven jin of rice per person per day. At present, the members have transported and sold 3,241 jin of millet and 6,035 jin of sorghum.

　　河间城厢供销合作社
  　帮助当地硝民转业
  　吸收社员千七百余人
    【河间消息】河间城厢区供销合作社，已初步建立，并开始解决了群众生活困难。河间城厢居民绝大部分原以熬硝维持生活，今年五月底火硝停止收购，硝民今后生活、生产都将受一定影响。县供销合作社就在解决这一问题的基础上，抽出一定干部，一方面帮助硝民转业，一方面发动全区群众建立供销合作社。他们先从解决群众实际困难，宣传组织供销社的好处入手，麦收前，城厢人民一般的是缺粮食，到集上买价钱贵，县供销社干部即抓紧给群众解决这一问题，马上从商店弄来小米三万七千斤、高粱一万一千零五十斤，稍低于市价卖给群众；并结合进行宣传，使群众认识了组织供销合作社的好处。一乡吴洛良听了说：“咱快入社吧！这比往利民交易所买东西不光便宜，还省很多工夫。”于是自己首先入了股，还带动起本乡一百三十人入了股。现在十三个乡已建立起社员社（不经营业务），吸收了一千七百九十五人入股成为社员。其中硝民入股的即达五百九十人。每个股小米五斤。
    河间城厢供销社从五月份着手建立，一个月来的统计：三个乡有二十八个生活困难的社员，社内将高粱、小米给他们推小车运到别处去卖，每人每天可得米七斤。现已通过社员运销出小米三千二百四十一斤，高粱六千零三十五斤。
