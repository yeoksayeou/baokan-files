Preliminary Opinions on Reforming University Education
    —A Preliminary Summary of Discussions by Students at Peiyang University
    Sima Qingxin

Because of the irrationality of the past university education system, and also because it fundamentally just copied the enslaving education of Anglo-American imperialism, the question of "how to reform university education" has attracted the attention and discussion of the general public in Tianjin and Beijing after liberation.

In order to re-evaluate and thoroughly reform the old university education system according to the needs of the revolutionary situation and revolutionary tasks, it is necessary and essential. Based on our experience at Peiyang University, various departments, groups, and organizations have enthusiastically discussed this "university education system issue" which is related to the future of university education, and have already made a preliminary summary. Now we are willing to report the results of the discussion to everyone for reference, hoping to arouse more university students to launch extensive discussions.

    (1) The Academic System

The academic system can be divided into two types: the credit system and the academic year system. Because of the differences in each person's intelligence and environment, and also the influence of physical and mental strength, the amount of coursework each person can handle cannot be equal. Therefore, the credit system should be adopted. However, there should be maximum and minimum standards for the number of credits earned each year, and there should also be a time limit (but no more than five years). As for how to determine the credits for each course, it must be coordinated with the importance of the courses in each department, and divided into elective and required courses. In principle, we agree with the results of the professor's meeting (Note: The professor's meeting of our school has discussed this issue), that is, one hour of class plus one to three hours of self-study is defined as one credit, but internships, experiments, and drawing are two hours per credit. As for examinations, because the original meaning of examinations is to urge students to study harder, check students' learning progress, and provide a basis for teachers to summarize their teaching content and methods. Under this principle, a reasonable grade assessment system should be established. (1) Hold more quizzes within the possible range. Reference books can be brought during the quiz, but students are not allowed to discuss with each other when answering the questions. (2) The examination time should be sufficient, the content should be broad, the test questions should avoid repetition with the exercises, and the questions should be set by the professors themselves, but they should not go beyond the scope. (3) Professors can refer to the small group discussions held by students, and use this as a reference for evaluating grades. (4) The midterm exam score should not account for the majority. In principle, regular quizzes account for 50 percent, exercise reports account for 20 percent, and the final exam accounts for 30 percent. (5) Written exams should be the main method, and group discussions should be the supplementary method. Reports should be made according to the needs of each course. The final exam can be a general report and reading experience. (6) Teaching assistants should host spot checks or assign grades based on reading reports as extracurricular homework. (7) Correct students' mentality of attaching importance to exams. Do not give notice before the exam, so as to avoid focusing only on the exam and neglecting usual studies and other things. (8) Calculate the exam scores by study group, that is, add up the scores of each person in the group, and the averaged result will be used as each person's score. In this way, the group will definitely supervise each other, and thus work hard on their studies. Good students will help those with poor grades, and those with poor grades will also be embarrassed not to work hard. Thus, everyone will improve, and the purpose of the examination will be achieved. After a long period of time, when everyone has become accustomed to it, the examination system can be abolished. (9) The number of exams and the percentage of points should be decided by the professors individually, because some students work very hard usually, but they may not necessarily do well in the exam, so the exam score is not enough to represent the student's learning situation. (10) Grading should refer to the mass assessment.

As for the issue of promotion and retention, there is actually no such thing as promotion or retention with the implementation of the credit system, because if you fail, you will retake the course, and if you have enough credits, you will graduate. If you don't have enough, you will take additional courses. Therefore, the terms "promotion" and "retention" can be abolished.

    (2) Learning Content

How to decide which courses to add or subtract, which are required, which are elective, and how should they be distributed? This kind of problem should be decided according to the relationship with the department. Of course, those with direct relationships are required, and others are elective. The English and Chinese courses in the freshman year can be based on the results of the entrance examination. After enrollment, they will be reviewed again. Those who achieve the standard can be exempted from the course, otherwise they must take it. In principle, required courses should account for four-fifths of all courses, and elective courses should account for one-fifth, and they should be interrelated. (As for the required, elective, and prerequisite courses, each department is currently drafting them, preparing for students to discuss them before the end of this semester, and then professors will offer opinions for joint supplementation and revision.)

Social sciences should be learned, because as a member of society, one should understand the situation of the society. Therefore, these should be designated as required or elective courses. Professors should explain them in class, launch discussions outside of class, and often invite specialists to guide, give lectures, and serve as consultants. Engineering schools should require economics, and science schools should require philosophy (or designate it as an elective, but one must be required). As for now, it is required in the freshman year, and others are elective.

Laboratories should be open at any time, and students can experiment freely. More practical problems should be discussed, and workers and peasants should be visited outside of class. Vacations should be used to go to factories.

    (3) Teaching Methods

Professors should first understand the needs and cultural level of most students, and then collect teaching materials. Lectures should be the main method, combined with leading students to carry out various learning methods and content, grasping the time, and being responsible for teaching within a certain period of time. They should always pay attention to the correct reflection of students' acceptance level as a reference for improving teaching methods.

Strengthen class study groups, strengthen the connection between teachers and students, and then launch well-prepared group discussions at the end of each course. Teachers must play a leading role in this discussion.

Our correct learning viewpoint is to serve the people. Only by carrying out learning centered on regular classes from this viewpoint can we have a future and learn well. This viewpoint must be quickly established on the basis of self-study and in combination with practice.

With a correct learning viewpoint, we must also have a correct learning attitude, that is, after knowing why we study, we must also know how to study. Our correct learning attitude should be seeking truth from facts. After the learning viewpoint is determined, this attitude is easy to establish. After establishing the learning viewpoint and learning attitude, we should improve the study groups and gradually expand to collective learning on the basis of the groups.

    (4) Other Aspects

Currently, there is a shortage of professors in each department. Therefore, we should hire more professors and take care of the lives of professors (such as building professor residences and raising salaries as much as possible).

If new professors cannot be hired for the time being, then professors from other departments can concurrently teach courses in this department. On the one hand, colleges and departments should be merged to concentrate resources, and classes should be combined to the greatest extent possible. Courses without professors should not be suspended, and collective discussions centered on lecturers and teaching assistants can be launched. Students can also collectively learn through self-study, summarize problems, and seek answers under the leadership of lecturers and teaching assistants.

Once professors are hired, they should immediately actively cooperate with students to make up for the courses.

"Reforming university education" is a very arduous and complex issue. We will never be satisfied with these small gains. In order to have a rational and perfect university education system, we are still continuing to discuss, and we are also striving to explore more other issues. We are willing to do our best, and we sincerely hope that everyone will discuss with each other!

　　改革大学教育的初步意见
    —北洋大学同学讨论的初步总结
    司马清心
    由于过去大学教育制度的不合理，而且根本上也只是抄袭了英美式帝国主义的奴化教育，所以“如何改革大学教育”的问题，在解放后的平津，已引起一般人的注意和讨论了。
    为了根据革命形势和革命任务的需要，把旧的大学教育制度来重新估价，澈底改革，是应该也是必需的。我们以北洋大学为根据，各系别、各小组、各社团都曾热烈地讨论了这个关乎大学教育前途的“大学教育制度问题”，而且已经有了初步的总结，现在我们愿意把讨论的结果，报导给大家作参考，希望能因此而引起更多大学的同学们能展开广泛的讨论。
    （一）学制问题
    学制可以分为学分制与学年制两种，因为各人的智力与环境的不同，而且身心强弱的影响，致使各人对课程担负量也不能相等，所以应该采取学分制。不过，对于每年所修学分可规定最高与最低的标准，也应该有年限的规定（但最多不得过五年）。对于怎么定每门学程之学分，则须配合各系课程之重要性，分别选修与必修，原则上赞成教授会讨论的结果（按：本校教授会曾讨论此问题），即上课一小时自修时间一小时至三小时者定为一学分，但实习、试验及制图每二小时为一学分。至于考试，因为考试的意义原是督促同学加紧学习，检查同学学习情况及教师讲授内容与方法以作局部总结的根据。在这个原则下，建立合理的成绩考核制度，应该（一）在可能范围内多举行小测验，测验时可带参考书，但作题时不得互相讨论。（二）考试时间充足，内容广泛，试题避免与习题重复，由教授自出，但不得越出范围。（三）教授可参考同学举行之小组讨论，而据此来作为评定成绩之参考。（四）期考分数不应占多数，原则上平常测验占百分之五十，习题报告占百分之二十，期考占百分之三十。（五）以笔试为主，集体讨论为副，按各课程之需要再作报告，大考可作总的报告及研读心得。（六）课外由助教主持举行抽考或以读书报告作课外作业定分。（七）纠正同学对考试重视的心里，考前不予通知，以免只顾考试而忽略平时及其他。（八）以学习小组为单位，计算考试分数，即把小组各人分数加起来，平均后的结果，作为每人的分数，如此，小组内必互相督促，从而努力功课，好的要帮助功课差的，而功课差的也不好意思不用功，于是大家都好起来，考试的目的也达到了，过一个长时期后，大家已成习惯，即可取消考试制度。（九）考试次数，分数所占百分比等由教授个别决定，因为有些同学平常很用功，考试时却不一定会考得好，故考试成绩是不足以代表学生学习情况的。（十）定分应参照群众评定。
    升留级问题，实行了学分制其实无所谓升级留级了，因为不及格就重修，学分满了就毕业，不够时再补修，所以“升级”“留级”的名词可以废除。
    （二）学习内容
    课程的增减和那些是必修，那些是选修以及应该如何分配？这种问题的决定要看与本系的关系怎样，有直接关系的当然必修，其他为选修。大一的英文、国文可以入学考试时的成绩作根据，入学后再审核一番，成绩够得上水准的可以免修，否则就得必修。又原则上必修的科目应占全部科目的五分之四，选修的占五分之一，并相互关联（至于必修、选修及预修的科目，现在正由各系在拟定，预备本学期结束前由同学讨论，教授提意见后共同补充修正。）
    社会科学应该学习，因为作为社会的一分子，他应该了解社会的情况，所以把这些定为必修或为选修，在课内由教授讲解，课外展开讨论，时常请专人指导、演讲并任顾问，工学院应必修经济学、理学院必修哲学（或定为选修，但必修一种）而按现在说大一必修，其他选修。
    实验室要随时开放，同学可自由实验，应多讨论实际问题课外访问工农，利用假期到工厂去。
    （三）教学方法
    教授事先要了解多数同学的需要与文化程度，然后采集教材，以讲授为主，酣合并领导同学进行各种学习方式与内容把握时间，负责在一定时间内授完，应随时注意同学接受程度的正确反映，作为改进教学方法的参考。
    加强班学习小组，加强教员与同学间的连系，然后在每一门课程到达一个段落时展开具有充分准备的集体讨论，教员必须在这个讨论会里起领导作用。
    我们正确的学习观点是为人民服务，只有在这个观点上进行以正课为中心的学习才能有前途，才能学得好。这个观点必须在自学的基础上与实际配合起来，才能迅速建立。
    有了正确的学习观点，还要有正确的学习态度，就是说知道了为什么学习后还得要知道怎样学习，我们正确的学习态度应该是实事求是，在学习观点确定后这个态度是容易树立的。确立了学习观点与学习态度后，健全学习小组，在小组的基础上逐步提高扩展到集体学习。
    （四）其他方面
    现在各系教授缺乏，所以，应该增聘教授，照顾教授生活（象修建教授住宅，尽可能提高待遇等。）
    如果一时请不到新教授，那么，非本系教授可以兼任本系课程，一方面，院系合并，集中力量，以及可能范围内合班上课，对没有教授的课程，不应停顿，可以展开以讲师助教为中心的集体讨论，同学更得以自修方式来集体学习，总结问题，在讲师助教的领导下求解答：
    一旦教授聘请到了，则应立即积极配合同学力求补足课程。
    “改革大学教育”是个相当艰巨而复杂的问题。我们绝不会满足于这些些小的收获，为了有一个合理而完善的大学教育制度，我们还在继续讨论，而且也还在努力发掘更多其他的问题，我们愿意尽自己最大的力量，也诚恳的希望大家来互相讨论！
