    Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 20th: TASS, New York: The struggle between US and British interests over foreign markets is becoming more open and acute as the domestic economic situations of both countries deteriorate. Currently, the most intense struggle between US and British monopoly capital is occurring in the Argentine market. Although the Anglo-Argentine five-year trade agreement has not yet been signed, American newspaper reports estimate that it will involve approximately £250 million in trade annually. This agreement would allow both Britain and Argentina to obtain some urgently needed supplies without spending US dollars. US monopoly capital, which is vying for the maximum amount of foreign markets, fiercely opposes this agreement. Although the contents of the agreement have not been announced, the US government has already made some indications to both countries. The Socony-Vacuum Oil Company and other US oil groups are particularly resentful of this agreement because it would deprive them of an important Argentine oil market, a large part of which has been under American control. It is reported that US manufacturers of mechanical equipment also fear that the Anglo-Argentine agreement will harm their market in Argentina. It is still unclear in what way the US is considering using pressure to at least have the Anglo-Argentine agreement modified somewhat. Washington sources suggest that if this agreement is implemented, the US may reduce "aid" from the Marshall Plan.

    美英经济形势恶化
    争夺阿根廷石油市场
    【新华社北平二十日电】塔斯社纽约讯：美英争夺国外市场的斗争随着两国国内经济形势的恶化而以更公开更尖锐的形式出现。目前，美英垄断资本在争夺阿根廷市场上发生了最尖锐的斗争。英阿五年贸易协定虽然还没有签字，美国报纸消息估计在该协定下每年约有二亿五千万英磅的贸易。这样，该协定可使英阿两国不必耗费美元即可取得一部分急需的供应品。争夺最大限度国外市场的美国垄断资本，激烈反对这一协定。协定的内容虽然还没有宣布，但美国政府已经向两国有所表示。美孚油公司和美国其他石油集团，特别愤恨这个协定，因为这个协定会剥夺他们重要的阿根廷石油市场，而这个市场的大部分，一直是在美国人控制之下的。据息，美商机械装备制造商，也惟恐英阿协定会损害他们在阿根廷的市场。现在还弄不清楚，美国在考虑以那种方式使用压力，以便至少使英阿协定得以修改一些华盛顿的消息暗示：如果这一协定实现，美国可能减削马歇尔计划的“援助”。
