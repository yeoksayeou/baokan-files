Xinhua News Agency, Hangzhou, 28th: The Kuomintang bandit troops who fled from various parts of eastern Zhejiang and southern Jiangsu to the Zhoushan Islands in Zhejiang are in utter disorder. Lower-ranking officers and soldiers are deserting in droves. According to Kuomintang soldiers who escaped from the island, in addition to the remnants of the bandit troops, there are also the puppet Jiangsu Provincial Government, the puppet Zhejiang Provincial Government, puppet county governments from various places, and various miscellaneous reactionary local armed forces. They wear different uniforms and speak with different accents, vying for civilian housing and temples. The puppet Jiangsu Security Regiment (now reorganized as the Provisional 1st Army) could not find housing and was squeezed onto Daqu and Dai Mountains. The remnants of the bandit 87th Army wandered along the coast for several days before finally settling down on the coast with difficulty. These remnants of the bandit troops, shattered by the People's Liberation Army, are grabbing soldiers from each other to replenish their depleted ranks. In Dinghai city, there are often more than a dozen different units of bandit troops grabbing soldiers, so that soldiers from each unit dare not go out unless they are in groups of five or six. Zhou Yan, the puppet Zhejiang Provincial Chairman, brought two security regiments, which were incorporated into the 6th Division of the 75th Army. The officers who were laid off have no food or lodging. The officers and soldiers of this unit circulated a self-deprecating saying: "Our code name is 7083, the Liberation Army has really beaten us into scattered pieces (七零八散 - sounds similar to 7083 in Chinese)." Due to the sudden increase in population, prices on the island have skyrocketed. One silver dollar can only buy two and a half packs of cigarettes, and one silver dollar can only buy two catties of fish and shrimp. Yu Wensheng, a deserter from the 5th Regiment of the 221st Division of the bandit 70th Army, said: "The entire regiment only has three days' worth of supplies left, and there is no sign of what we will eat after that." Vegetables are no longer available on the island, cooking oil is extremely scarce, and firewood is becoming increasingly difficult to find. The bandit gang, from top to bottom, is planning to escape. Senior agencies are preparing to flee to Taiwan, and many high-ranking officials have already sent their families away, preparing to run away as soon as there is a "reason." The vast majority of lower-ranking officers and soldiers, regardless of the bandit army headquarters' suppression with "execution without pardon" and "public execution," are fleeing to the mainland in droves. More than 40 soldiers deserted from a regiment of the bandit 75th Army stationed in Shenjiamen in one night alone. Li Huange, the commander of the bandit Provisional 1st Division, sent a trusted code clerk with a squad leader and a guard to Xiangshan to pick up his family, but all three defected to the People's Liberation Army. The search platoon of the puppet Jinshan County Security Regiment, consisting of thirty men, led by platoon leader Ruan Lizhong, sailed two civilian boats to Daxu Mountain, across the coast from Jinshan County, and surrendered to the local People's Liberation Army.

　　逃舟山群岛匪军
  　狼狈万状
    【新华社杭州二十八日电】由浙东、苏南各地逃窜到浙江舟山群岛上的国民党匪军狼狈万状，下级军官和士兵纷纷逃亡。据从该岛逃来的国民党军士兵供称，云集在岛上的，除了匪军残部外，还有伪江苏省政府、伪浙江省政府、各地伪县政府和各种杂乱的反动地方武装。他们穿着各式不同的服装，操着各种不同的口音，互相争夺民房、寺庙。伪江苏保安团（现改编为暂一军）找不到房子，被挤到大衢山和岱山上去。匪八十七军残部，在海边上彷徨了几天，最后勉强在海岸上住下。这些被解放军打得残缺不全的匪军残部，互相抓兵来补充自己的缺额。在定海街上，经常有十几种不同番号的匪军们抓兵，以致各部士兵非五六人在一起不敢外出。伪浙江省主席周碞带去的两个保安团，被编入了七十五军第六师，被编余的军官，吃住都无着落。该部官兵中流传着这样的自嘲的话：“我们的代号是七零八三，解放军把我们真的打成七零八散了”。由于人口突增，岛上物价飞腾，纸烟一块银元只能买两包半，鱼虾一块银元只能买二斤。匪七十军二二一师第五团的逃兵于文升说：“全团只剩下三天吃的给养，以后吃什么还没有影子。”岛上青菜已经买不到，食油奇缺，烧柴愈来愈困难。匪帮上上下下都打算着逃跑。高级机关准备着逃往台湾，许多大官已把家眷送走，准备一有“事由”撤腿就跑。广大的下级军官和土兵们则不顾匪军指挥部的“格杀勿论”“处决示众”的镇压，纷纷向大陆上逃。单住在沈家门的匪七十五军一个团，一夜就逃亡了四十多名，匪暂一师师长李焕阁派了亲信的译电员带着一个班长和一个卫士去象山接家眷，结果三个人一齐投奔解放军。逃到岛上的伪金山县保安团搜索排三十人，在排长阮立中率领下乘民船两艘开到金山县对岸的大徐山，向该地解放军投诚。
