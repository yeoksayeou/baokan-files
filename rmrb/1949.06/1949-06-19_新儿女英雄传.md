  　Chapter Nine: The Moment of Life and Death (Continued 2)
    Five
    The enemy returned to Dongyu Village. Niu Dashui woke up, and the enemy押押 him into the backyard of the garrison team's residence, confining him in a wooden cage in the south room. At dusk, the old man guarding him quietly said to him, "Your mother has come to see you. Keep your voice down when you talk." Then he went out. Dashui thought to himself, "My mother died long ago, how come there's another mother?" Just as he was thinking, the guard brought in an old white-haired woman, carrying a basket in her hand. Dashui recognized her as Wang Shugen's mother from Xiyu Village. Wang Shugen had already been buried alive by the enemy when the mopping-up operation started. At that moment, Wang Dama spoke a few words to the guard. The old man then went out.
    The old woman grabbed the wooden cage, her white head extending over, and whispered, "Dashui啊! I've recognized you as my son, just say you are Wang Shugen. Shuangxi told you to stay calm and don't admit anything. The whole village is vouching for you. Alas, my dear! Seeing you, it really breaks my heart! Today, no one can eat, everyone is collecting money for you." Hearing this, Dashui felt a surge of heat in his heart, and tears streamed down his face as he cried, "Mother! ... Don't worry! ... Tell Shuangxi, I'll fight for my life, you ... don't worry about me!"
    The old woman lifted her tattered衣襟, wiped her tears, took out the eggs, fried dough twists, sesame cakes... and many other things that the villagers had given him from the basket, stuffed them into the wooden cage, and placed them in front of Dashui. She then took out a small paper packet from her bosom and gave it to Dashui, saying, "Son, this is a little money I'm giving you, keep it for pocket money." The old woman did not dare to delay any longer, gave a few instructions, and then left.
    Two days later, two puppet soldiers, carrying guns, took Dashui out to court. Walking to the Japanese barracks, Dashui saw many old fellow villagers from Xiyu Village standing at the door, with the old woman among them, all looking at him expectantly.
    Dashui entered the room. A white-faced Japanese, wearing a pair of small glasses, whom people called "Dog Teeth," was sitting there, talking with a "translator": puppet队长 Yang Hualian was also sitting on the side. The translator asked Dashui to stand in front of the table and asked him what his name was and where he lived. Dashui insisted that he was from Xiyu Village, and his name was Wang Shugen. When asked what he did, Dashui said he was a farmer. Yang Hualian asked, "Are you a 八路 after all?" Dashui said, "I plow, plant, hoe, and weed all year round, how can I be a 八路?" Yang Hualian slapped the table and shouted, "If you're not, why did you admit to being a 八路 that day?" Dashui said, "They kept hitting me, knocked me unconscious, and I was talking nonsense."
    Yang Hualian turned his face, and咕噜咕噜说了 talk with "Dog Teeth" for a while, then "Dog Teeth" nodded, then used red and blue pencils to write the three characters "共产党" on a piece of paper, pointing to Niu Dashui: "You! 共产党!" Dashui was startled. But "Dog Teeth" crossed out the three characters with a big "×", saying, "You! Not!" Then he wrote the three characters "八路军", saying, "You! 八路军!" Dashui was startled again. "Dog Teeth" again drew a big ×: "You 八路, no!" Then write "Worker", and cross out. Finally write a "Good people", say: "You, good people, good good! 开路开路!" Yang Hualian said with a smile to Dashui, "The 太君 has spared you, go and plant your crops!" The puppet soldiers then untied Dashui.
    "Dog Teeth" raised his small glasses, stood up, and walked into the inner room with Yang Hualian. As he walked, "Dog Teeth" said, "Captain Yang! You, Wang Shugen's金票, big big have! Big big rich!" Yang Hualian said: "I want to get rich, this one has!" Saying that, he chopped his neck with his hand, and "Dog Teeth"嘻嘻嘻 laughed.
    Dashui was released. As soon as he went out, the old fellow villagers surrounded him; some helped him, some asked about his well-being. A group of people wrapped up his wounds, changed his clothes, and happily walked out of the village. Turning a corner, they were met by several horses, and the people quickly stepped aside. A fat officer, like He Shixiong, was riding on the first horse. After a few horses passed, the old people whispered: "The fat man is in the city as a big head at the moment! Let's go quickly."
    Just as they were saying, suddenly a horse turned back. A man on the horse with a box gun shouted: "Stop! What are you doing?" Dashui heard Zhang Jinlong's voice, and quickly lowered his head.
    It turned out that the person was Zhang Jinlong. This rogue, this破落户, this landlord's dog leg, at the beginning of the mopping-up operation, surrendered to his original master He Shixiong and became a traitor. At this moment, he came over on a horse and said, "Huh, isn't this Niu Dashui! I thought it looked like you!" Saying that, he jumped off his horse, carrying the box gun, and happily walked over and said, "Ha, it's a coincidence, I'm looking for you! Come with me." The old woman rushed over and said, "What are you doing? You just came out of the official residence, the Japanese are fine! We are all Chinese..." Zhang Jinlong slapped the old woman to the ground, pointing the box gun at Dashui and said, "Captain Niu! Aren't you a hero? Let's go, go to our Captain He's place and show off your power!"
    As he spoke, two more horses turned back. Dashui gritted his teeth and said, "Good Zhang Jinlong! I knew you were going to do this! Hero or not, we will never be traitors! Let's go! I'll risk my one hundred pounds, and I'm not born of my parents if I'm afraid of you!" Zhang Jinlong took out a rope, twisted Dashui's arm and tied him up. The old people all came up to say good things; Zhang Jinlong cursed, tied Dashui五花六道, gave a horse to the two puppet soldiers, and pushed Dashui away.
    Six
    They took Dashui to Hezhuang and押押 him in the backyard of the He family mansion.
    He Shixiong came back this time, and he was very aggressive. In the past few years, he has been a traitor in the city, and the land he had occupied in the village had been returned to the original owners for cultivation; in the second year of扒堤放水, he returned the blood and sweat he had collected from the people—dozens of石 wheat buried in the ground, to the poor to help them survive the spring shortage. This time, as soon as he returned home, he "猪八戒倒打一钉耙", took back the land, and went door-to-door searching for food,抢东西,打人,牵牲口... and also looking for our cadres everywhere. Fortunately, the cadres were hidden, and the relatives of the cadres went to relatives and friends, looking for food and begging, and they all escaped. He had no way to vent his anger, so he set fire and burned many houses.
    That night, the Japanese commander Kameban passed by here. He Shixiong held a banquet to entertain him, and that kind of flattery was really eager to hold Kameban's butt and kiss him.
    That 亀板 had a long, thin face, high cheekbones, and a仁丹 mustache; he could speak Chinese. He twirled his mustache, raised his chin, and squinted at He Shixiong with his yellow eyes. He said with his womanly voice, "The Yamato nation is the strongest in the world! Look, the Great Japanese Imperial Army has defeated the United States in the Pacific! Your small China doesn't need to fight!"
    He blew a theory of "Sino-Japanese Cooperation," saying that Wang Jingwei was good, and that Chiang Kai-shek was also good, and behind his back he extended his arm to shake hands with the "Imperial Army"; but the "Communist Party" was very bad, and was the "Imperial Army's" mortal enemy, so it was necessary to focus the main force on "suppressing the Communists." Speaking of "suppressing the Communists," his "Bushido spirit" caused the veins on his forehead to burst out, and his voice sharpened, saying: "Suppressing the Communists is like刨树的. If you saw all the branches and bodies of the tree, the bottom will still produce trees! You have to find out all the lower-level organizations of the Communist Party,刨了根, and even if there is a tree, it will die!"
    After the Japanese commander left, He Shixiong dragged Niu Dashui out for interrogation.
    Seven
    Late at night, Niu Dashui was押 to He Shixiong's room.
    Two large bulb lamps were lit in the room. The people were all凶眉恶眼 and full of murderous intent; next to them were sticks, knives, ropes, pressing杠子... In the stove were burning烙铁 and火箸. Dashui looked at it, like entering the阎王殿.
    He Shixiong hated to bite his teeth when he saw Niu Dashui. He laughed fiercely and said, "Niu Dashui! Everything is prepared for you, see what kind of dish you like to eat!" The people on both sides shouted, "Kneel down!" Dashui said, "Kneel down for what! I am not guilty!" He Shixiong slapped the table and cursed: "You混蛋!" Dashui was so angry that his heart was冒火, saying: "You八个混蛋!" He Shixiong with横肉 face waved: "Let him taste!" Two agents twisted Dashui's arm, one from behind用条白布把他脑袋一勒, the other took two pieces of sandalwood board, hit Dashui's face啪啪啪 back and forth, a few strokes, 打得 Dashui mouth even blood带沫子 flow down, the tongue is numb, like棉花禳子 like;眼头上 also挨了一下, only feel昏昏沉沉 do not understand things.
    They熏醒 Dashui with a roll of 草纸. He Shixiong asked: "Where are Hei Lao Cai and Liu Shuangxi?" Dashui said: "I don't know!" He Shixiong asked: "The last time you and Liu Shuangxi came here to arrest me, who reported the letter and who came up with the idea?" Dashui一只眼儿糊着血,一只眼儿瞪着, said: "Don't ask me, what do you ask me to do!" He Shixiong sneered: "Scare! This kid hasn't tasted the good taste yet! Give him a bowl of yellow rice!"
    Dashui behind那家伙, with the knee抵住 Dashui's waist, the white cloth in the hand紧紧一勒,勒得 him仰了脸儿;旁的人就用小米泡凉水,灌 in his nose. Also heard He Shixiong said: "How about you eat this bowl of rice? Have a full meal!" Dashui can't help but a breath,呼的 on吸进去了,呛得 brain sour,忽忽游游的又过去了.
    They又把他熏过来. Dashui迷迷煳糊的, the millet sprayed out of the nose全成了血蛋蛋, also came out in the mouth, the body is blood and water. He Shixiong得意的说: "You kid is good!铁嘴钢牙,柏木舌头; when it comes to my hand, see if you are still厲害!"
    Zhang Jinlong叨着个烟卷儿 came;对 Dashui露出金牙齿, laughingly said: "Still said it, Niu Dashui! You Party members, what do not know啊? You are the红人 on the district! Hei Lao Cai is your cousin, you and Liu Shuangxi are his胳膊腿儿, the lower-level organizations are all you鼓捣起来的. You say it nothing; do not say it, how can you not go through this level! Look at me in the past also 干的那一行, and you are 一势;说过来不就过来啦!"
    Dashui angrily浑身乱颤,眼珠子都瞪出来了, a mouth黏糊糊的 blood沫子,呸的唾了 Zhang Jinlong a face, said: "Traitor王八蛋! Who is 一势 with you?" Zhang Jinlong took out a silk handkerchief, smeared his face, a eyebrow pressed down, fiercely瞪着 Niu Dashui: "Mother sell ×的! You kid still sell bones?" With a random抽出的烧红的烙铁,把 Dashui's褂子撕开,就吱啦啦的烙 his back, the back烧得 straight flow oil,一阵阵的冒烟,满脊梁都烧糊了啊! Dashui喊, Dashui叫, Dashui cried and cursed: "You traitors好狠心! Do not leave a little affection for the Chinese ah! Communist Party八路军抗日救国,有什罪呀?" He fell from the eyes, not tears, are blood ah!
    He Shixiong拧着眉头, slowly smoking; suddenly抬起眼皮子,奸笑的说: "Niu Dashui! Don't be diehard, holding the egg碰 with the stone! What is it for you? The black old Cai Liu Shuangxi,未必有你这么坚决! You hard抗硬顶, in vain send the life, who to pity you ah!" Busy called people to Dashui松了绳子,端个凳儿給他坐;劝他说: "You do not be sad! Today I drank a little wine, brothers打了你, seems strange sorry for you; in fact, there is nothing! You do not take it to heart. Look at Jinlong, come over here more'得' ah! Eat good, wear good, and have money to spend! As long as you change your mind, I will give you an official to do, let you also阔气阔气!"
    He Shixiong one face say, one side楞着三角眼儿瞅 Dashui's face; see Dashui bowed his head and said nothing, think he must give said moving, it give Zhang Jinlong丢了个眼色. Zhang Jinlong went out, he接下去说: "To say the Anti-Japanese War, I He Shixiong also anti-Japanese in the past, and now is not not抗日 ah! The time of the Anti-Japanese War is long! What anxious?"
    Zhang Jinlong came in, and behind him a man was holding a tray with wine, meat, and white flour卷子 on the tray, came over and put it on the small table in front of Dashui, He Shixiong reached out and said: "Niu comrade! Eat quickly! To press your惊! You are a good kind of, you two will make friends in the future!"
    Dashui was furious, picked up a bowl of pork, took it to He Shixiong and fell over. He Shixiong let不及, oil卤卤的, straight洒了一身,碗儿也打烂了. People are busy to catch Dashui. He Shixiong jumped up, angry face is purple, drank and said: "This kid is really他妈不识抬举! Give you face shamelessly! I'll see! See you拧得过我, or I拧得过你!" He吼了一声, a few如狼似虎的家伙,又横拖倒拉的把 Dashui拾掇开了.
    They exhausted various kinds of torture, Dashui suffered all kinds of crimes. They wanted to dig out the confession and wipe out the Communist Party in this area, but Dashui bite his teeth and did not say a word. When the chicken called, the people拾掇 him are all tired of it. He Shixiong擦着秃脑瓜上的汗,把鼻子都给气歪了, said: "This number of things is not human! Quick拉出去砍了 him, feed the dog to eat!" Dashui has been lying on the ground can not move. A group of people架着 him, Zhang Jinlong holding a big knife,颠着屁股 go in the head, He Shixiong那条狼狗,摇着尾巴 follow in the back, all go to the village.
    The moon is very bright,四下里静悄悄的. To the south of the village a乱坟堆, a lonely poplar tree, they剥下 Dashui's blood clothes, Dashui only wear a shorts, bare head, bare feet, give them推推搡搡的kneel on the ground. The wolf dog sat on the side waiting. Zhang Jinlong first the knife on the stone供桌哧哧磨了几下, moonlight, that knife is really bright啊! He挥起大刀, Niu Dashui fell down. (To be continued)

　　新儿女英雄传
  　第九回　生死关头（续二）
    五
    敌人回到东渔村，牛大水醒过来了，敌人把他押进警备队住的后院，关在南屋一个木笼子里。傍黑，看守他的老头，悄悄儿对他说：“你娘看你来啦，你们说话小声点儿。”就走出去了。大水心里想：“我娘早死啦，怎么又来个娘呢？”正想着，看守带进来一个白头发的老妈妈，手里提着个篮儿；大水认得他是西渔村王树根的娘，王树根已经在扫荡开始的时候，给敌人活埋了。当下王大妈跟看守说了两句话。老头儿就出去了。
    老妈妈抓住木笼，白发的头儿伸过来，小声说：“大水啊！我把你认下啦，你就说你是王树根。双喜叫你沉住气，什么都别承认。咱们一村都在保你呢。唉，我的亲人哪！看着你，真叫人心疼得不行啊！今儿个谁也吃不下饭，大伙儿正在给你凑钱呢。”大水听着，心里一阵热辣辣的，泪珠儿直往下掉，哭着说：“娘！……你放心！……你跟双喜说，我死活总得争口气，你们……别结记我！”
    老妈妈撩起破衣襟，擦了泪，从篮里拿出乡亲们交给他的鸡子儿、油散子、烧饼…许多东西，塞进木笼里，放在大水跟前；又从怀里摸出个小纸包儿，塞给大水说：“小子，这是我给你的一点钱儿，留着你零花吧。”老妈妈不敢多耽搁，叮咛了几句就走了。
    过了两天，两个伪军端着枪，把大水提出去过堂。走到鬼子营房，大水看见门口站着西渔村的许多老乡亲，老妈妈也在里面，都眼巴巴的望着他。
    大水进了屋子。一个白脸儿鬼子，戴着一付小眼镜，人家叫他“狗牙子伤”的，正坐在那儿，和旁边一个“翻译官”说话：伪队长杨花脸也坐在一边。翻译官叫大水站到桌子跟前，问他姓什么叫什么，住在那儿。大水一口咬定是西渔村的，叫王树根。又问他是干什么的，大水说是庄稼人。杨花脸问：“你到底是不是八路？”大水说：“我一年到头，耕耩锄耪，怎么是个八路呢？”杨花脸拍着桌子，喝着说：“你不是，你那天为什么承认是八路呢？”大水说：“他们一个劲的打我，把我打昏了，我说的胡话。”
    杨花脸转过脸去，跟“狗牙子伤”咕噜咕噜的说了一阵话，那“狗牙子伤”点点头，就用红蓝铅笔，在一张纸上写“共产党”三个大字，指着牛大水：“你！共产党！”大水吓了一跳。可是“狗牙子伤”在那三个字上划了个大“×”，说：“你！不是！”又写“八路军”三个大字，说：“你！八路军！”大水又吓了一跳。“狗牙子伤”又划了个大×：“你八路，不是的！”又写“工作员”，又划掉。最后写了个“良民”，说：“你，良民，好的好的！开路开路！”杨花脸笑着对大水说：“太君饶了你了，好好儿种你的庄稼去吧！”伪军就给大水解绳子。
    “狗牙子伤”抬一抬小眼镜，站起来，和杨花脸走进里间去。一面走，那“狗牙子伤”一面说：“杨队长！你，王树根的金票，大大的有！大大的发财！”杨花脸说：“我要发财，这个的有！”说着用手在脖子上砍了一下，“狗牙子伤”就嘻嘻嘻的笑起来了。
    大水放出来，刚出门，老乡亲们就围上来了；有的扶着他，有的问长问短。一伙人给他裹好伤，换了衣裳，欢欢喜喜的往村外走。一转弯，迎头来了几匹马，人们赶快让开。头一匹马上骑的一个胖军官，象是何世雄。几匹马过去了，老乡们低声说：“胖子这会儿在城里当什么大头儿呢！咱们快走吧。”
    正说着，忽然一匹马转回来了。马上一个挎盒子枪的喊了声：“站住！你们干什么的？”大水一听是张金龙的声音，忙低下头。
    原来那人正是张金龙。这流氓，这破落户，这地主的狗腿，在扫荡一开始，就投奔了他原来的主子何世雄，当上汉奸了。这会儿他一马过来，说：“吓，这不是牛大水吗！我看着就象你！”说着跳下马，提着盒子枪，高兴的走来说：“哈，巧极了，正找你呢！快跟我走吧。”老妈妈抢上来说：“你这是干什么呀？才打官司出来，日本人那儿都没事啦！咱们都是中国人…”张金龙一个巴掌把老妈妈打得跌在地上了，用盒子枪指着大水说：“牛队长！你不是英雄好汉吗？走吧，到咱们何大队长那儿去，耍耍你的威风吧！”
    说话间，又有两匹马转回来了。大水咬着牙说：“好张金龙！我早知道你要干这勾当的！英雄不英雄，咱反正不当汉奸！走就走！豁出我这一百多斤，怕你我就不是爹娘养的！”张金龙掏出绳子来，拧着大水的胳膊就捆。老乡们都上来说好话；张金龙骂着，把大水捆了个五花六道，一匹马交给那两个伪军，他推着大水就走。
    六
    他们把大水带到何庄，押在何家大宅的后院。
    何世雄这次回来，可耀武扬威极了。这几年他在城里当汉奸，村里把他过去霸占的土地，都让原主耕种了；扒堤放水的第二年，又把他搜刮老百姓的血汗—埋在地里的几十石麦子，退还穷人渡了春荒。这次他一回家，就“猪八戒倒打一钉耙”，夺回土地，还挨家挨户搜粮食、抢东西、打人、牵牲口……又到处找咱们的干部。幸亏干部们藏的藏了，跑的跑了；家属们投亲戚，靠朋友，寻吃要饭，也都逃了。他没法子出气，就放火，烧了许多房子。
    这天晚上，日本司令龟板路过这儿。何世雄摆了酒席招待他，那股子奉承劲儿，真是恨不得捧着龟板的屁股亲嘴呢。
    那龟板瘦长脸儿，高颧骨，留着仁丹胡子；会说中国话。他捻着胡子，抬起下巴，两只黄黄的小眼珠斜瞅着何世雄；他那女人似的嗓子，傲慢的说：“大和民族是世界上最强的！你看，大日本皇军在太平洋上，把美国都打败了！你们小小的中国，不用打！”
    他吹了一通“中日提携”的理论，说汪精卫好，又说蒋介石也不错，背后伸出个胳膊跟“皇军”拉手呢；就是“共产党”大大的坏，是“皇军”的死对头，所以一定要把主要的力量放在“剿共”上。一说起“剿共”，他那“武士道精神”，使他额上筋都暴起来了，声音发尖的说：“剿共好比刨树的。你把树枝树身的统统的锯了，底下又会出树！你要把共产党的下层组织统统查出来，刨了根，就是有树也死了的！”
    鬼子司令走了以后，何世雄就把牛大水拉出来审问。
    七
    夜深了，牛大水给押到何世雄的屋里。
    屋里点着两盏大泡子灯。人们一个个凶眉恶眼，杀气腾腾；旁边放着棍子、刀、绳、压人的杠子……火炉里烧着烙铁和火箸。大水瞧着，就象进了阎王殿似的。
    何世雄见了牛大水，恨得咬牙。他凶狠狠的笑着说：“牛大水！什么都给你准备好了，你看那样菜好吃就吃那样吧！”两边的人喝一声：“跪下！”大水说：“跪什么！我没有罪！”何世雄拍着桌子骂：“你混蛋！”大水气得心头冒火，说：“你八个混蛋！”何世雄满脸横肉，挥手说：“叫他尝尝！”两个特务拧住大水的胳膊，一个从后面用条白布把他脑袋一勒，另一个拿两块檀木板，照大水脸上啪啪啪的左右来回的打，几下子，打得大水嘴里连血带沫子流下来，舌头都麻了，象棉花禳子似的；眼头上也就挨了一下，只觉得昏昏沉沉不懂事了。
    他们用一卷草纸把大水熏醒过来。何世雄问：“黑老蔡刘双喜他们在那儿？”大水说：“不知道！”何世雄问：“上一回你和刘双喜到这儿来抓我，是谁报的信，谁出的主意？”大水一只眼儿糊着血，一只眼儿瞪着，说：“你别问我，你问我干吗！”何世雄冷笑说：“吓！这小子还没尝着好滋味呢！给他一碗黄米饭吃！”
    大水背后那家伙，用膝盖顶住大水的腰，手里的白布紧紧一勒，勒得他仰了脸儿；旁的人就用小米泡凉水，往他鼻子里灌。还听见何世雄说：“你吃这碗饭怎么样啊？饱饱儿的吃一顿吧！”大水忍不住，一吸气，呼的就吸进去了，呛得脑了酸酸的，忽忽游游的又过去了。
    他们又把他熏过来。大水迷迷煳糊的，鼻子里喷出来的小米全成了血蛋蛋，嘴里也出来了，身上又是血又是水。何世雄得意的说：“你小子好啊！铁嘴钢牙，柏木舌头；到了我手里，看你还厉害不厉害！”
    张金龙叨着个烟卷儿来了；对大水露出金牙齿，笑嘻嘻的说：“还是说了吧，牛大水！你们党员，什么不知道啊？你又是区上的红人！黑老蔡就是你的表哥，你和刘双喜是他的胳膊腿儿，下层组织都是你们鼓捣起来的。你说出来没事儿；不说出来，怎么也过不去这一关哟！你看我从前也干的那一行，跟你是一势；说过来不就过来啦！”
    大水气得浑身乱颤，眼珠子都瞪出来了，一嘴黏糊糊的血沫子，呸的唾了张金龙一脸，说：“汉奸王八蛋！谁跟你一势？”张金龙掏出绸手绢，抹抹脸，一条眉毛压了下来，狠狠的瞪着牛大水：“娘卖×的！你小子还卖骨头？”随手抽出烧红的烙铁，把大水的褂子撕开，就吱啦啦的烙他的背，背上烧得直流油，一阵阵的冒烟，满脊梁都烧糊了啊！大水喊，大水叫，大水哭着骂：“你们这些汉奸好狠心！对中国人一点不留情啊！共产党八路军抗日救国，有什罪呀？”他眼里掉下来的，不是泪，都是血啊！
    何世雄拧着眉头，慢慢的吸烟；忽然抬起眼皮子，奸笑的说：“牛大水！你别死心眼儿，拿着鸡蛋跟石头碰！你这是何苦呢？人家黑老蔡刘双喜，未必有你这么坚决！你硬抗硬顶，白白送了命，谁来怜惜你呀！”忙叫人给大水松了绳子，端个凳儿给他坐；劝他说：“你也别难过！今天我喝了点儿酒，弟兄们打了你，显得怪对不起你的；其实这也没什么！你也别放在心上。你看金龙，过这边来多‘得’呀！吃的好，穿的好，还有钱儿花！只要你回心转意，我也给你个官儿做，让你也阔气阔气！”
    何世雄一面说，一面楞着三角眼儿瞅大水的脸色；见大水低着头儿不说话，想他一定给说动了，就给张金龙丢了个眼色。张金龙出去了，他接下去说：“要说抗日，我何世雄过去也是抗日的，现在也不是不抗日啊！抗日的时间长着哪！着什么急呢？”
    张金龙进来了，后面一个人端着托盘，盘子里有酒有肉，有白面卷子，过来放在大水跟前的小桌子上，何世雄伸手说：“牛同志！快吃吧！给你压压惊！你是个好样儿的，咱俩今后交个朋友！”
    大水气坏了，拿起一碗猪肉，照着何世雄就摔过去。何世雄让不及，油卤卤的，直洒了一身，碗儿也打烂了。人们忙捉住大水。何世雄跳起来，气得脸儿发紫，喝着说：“这小子真他妈不识抬举！给你脸不要脸！我倒瞧瞧！看你拧得过我，还是我拧得过你！”他吼了一声，几个如狼似虎的家伙，又横拖倒拉的把大水拾掇开了。
    他们用尽了各种刑罚，大水受尽了各种罪。他们想掏出口供，把这一带共产党一网打尽，大水可咬着牙，一个字也不说。鸡叫了，拾掇他的人们全累得不行了。何世雄擦着秃脑瓜上的汗，把鼻子都给气歪了，说：“这号东西不是人！快拉出去砍了他，喂狗吃！”大水已经躺在地上不能动了。一伙人架着他，张金龙拿着一把大刀，颠着屁股走在头里，何世雄的那条狼狗，摇着尾巴跟在后面，都往村外走。
    月儿很明，四下里静悄悄的。到了村南一片乱坟堆，一棵孤伶伶的杨树旁边，他们剥下大水的血衣裳，大水只穿个裤衩儿，光着头，赤着脚，给他们推推搡搡的跪在地上。狼狗坐在一边等着。张金龙先把刀子在石头供桌上哧哧的磨了几下，月光里，那刀子真亮啊！他挥起大刀，牛大水就倒下了。（未完）
