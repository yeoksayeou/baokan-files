Several Simple Methods for Eliminating Pests

　　This year, crops and vegetable seedlings in many places are suffering from pest infestations. Here are several methods for killing insects:

　　(1) Chop chives (or old chives) into small pieces, soak them in water for two days, and then apply the water to the roots of crops infested with aphids. The aphids will disappear in just two days.

　　(2) For vegetable seedlings, melons, and beans infested with insects, use one pound of lime, add it to a bucket of water, and boil it three or four times. One bucket of water can be used to spray one to two mu. It is best to spray twice.

　　(3) Grind half a tael of alum into a fine powder, then mix it with one jin of clear ash, and sprinkle it on the vegetables in the evening. Green worms, black worms, etc., on the seedlings will be killed the next day.

　　(4) Burn garlic cloves into ash (garlic sprouts can also be used), add it to the fertilizer water, and pour it on the vegetables or seedlings to kill the insects.

　　The most effective way to kill insects is to turn the soil in spring and winter. On the one hand, it can completely suppress the insects underground and suffocate them. On the other hand, it can also loosen the soil, which will not only change the soil quality but also prevent the ground from getting cold, allowing the crop roots to grow deeper. This can be followed by two top-dressings of fertilizer. In addition, when sowing millet, add mustard to the millet seeds. When the millet sprouts, the mustard also sprouts. When the insects eat the mustard seedlings, they will not dare to eat the millet, and may even be killed by the spiciness. This way, the millet seedlings can be preserved.

　　几种除害虫简法
    今年不少地方庄稼菜苗发生虫害，特把几种杀虫的办法介绍如下：
    （一）把韭菜（或老韭菜也可）用刀切碎，放到水里泡两天后，再放到生蜜虫的庄稼根上，只用两日，就使蜜虫绝迹。
    （二）菜苗、瓜和豆角等生了虫，用石灰一斤，放上一桶水在锅里，煮开三四次，一桶水可以洒一亩至二亩。洒两次最好。
    （三）用半两大矾，磨成细末，再用一斤清灰，到晚上撒到菜上，苗子上的青虫黑虫等，第二天即被杀完了。
    （四）用蒜瓣烧成灰（蒜苗也可）放到追粪水里，浇到菜上或苗上，也可把虫杀死。
    杀虫最有效的办法是在春冬两季翻翻地，一面能够把虫完全压到地下，把他闷死，另一方面也可把土掘松，既会改变了土质，又使地不受冷，使庄稼根扎的深，这能跟上两次追肥。此外在耩谷子时，在谷种里加上芥茉，谷子出来时，芥茉也出来了，蚀虫吃到芥茉苗后就不敢吃谷，甚至被辣死了，这样谷苗即可保全下来。
