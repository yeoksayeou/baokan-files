　　　　Order of the Central Military Commission of the Chinese People's Revolution

The styles of the military flag and military emblem of the Chinese People's Liberation Army are hereby announced as follows:

First, Military Flag

The military flag of the Chinese People's Liberation Army is red, with a golden-yellow five-pointed star and the characters "八一" (8-1), indicating that the Chinese People's Liberation Army, since its birth in the Nanchang Uprising on August 1, 1927, has undergone a long struggle and is now illuminating the whole country with its brilliant starlight.

(A) Method of Manufacture:

　　(1) The flag surface is red, rectangular, with a horizontal to vertical ratio of five to four. The flag pole sleeve is white, with a width of one-sixteenth of the horizontal length of the flag surface. The flag pole is a spiral pattern of alternating red and yellow, with a yellow spearhead at the top.

　　(2) Draw a vertical center line from the center point of the flag surface upwards and downwards, and draw a horizontal center line to the left and right, dividing the flag surface into four rectangular grids of equal area.

　　(3) The five-pointed star and the characters "八一" (8-1) are both golden yellow and located in the upper rectangular grid near the flagpole.

　　(4) Divide the rectangular grid into sixteen equal parts vertically and twenty equal parts horizontally. At the points eight to eight vertically and six to fourteen horizontally, determine a point as the center of a circle with a radius of four equal parts. Connect the five division points of the circumference of the circle with straight lines to form a five-pointed star, with the upper vertex of the star directly above the center of the circle.

　　(5) "八一" (8-1) uses Chinese characters, each stroke being an equilateral strip. When the flagpole is on the left, the two characters are placed in the lower right of the five-pointed star and written horizontally from left to right. When the flagpole is on the right, the two characters should be located in the lower left of the five-pointed star and written horizontally from right to left.

　　(6) Each stroke of the character "八" (8) is three equal parts long and one equal part wide, and is placed in a small rectangular grid. The upper side of the small rectangular grid is seven equal parts upwards from the horizontal center line, and the lower side is four equal parts upwards from the horizontal center line. The left side (or the right side if the flagpole is on the right) is the vertical line drawn downwards from the upper right corner tip (or upper left corner tip) of the five-pointed star, and the right line (or left side) runs four and a half equal parts to the left (or right) of the vertical center line. The six right-angled tips on the outer sides of the two strokes of the character "八" (8) should be tightly connected to the corresponding sides of the small rectangular grid, and the two right-angled tips on the inner side should be about half an equal part apart. The character "一" (1) is four equal parts long and one equal part wide. The lower side of the character is five equal parts upwards from the horizontal center line, and the right side (or left side) is on the vertical center line.

(B) Dimensions of Military Flags at All Levels are as Follows:

　　(1) Headquarters of the People's Liberation Army: 170 cm horizontal, 136 cm vertical

　　(2) Field Army (same as First-Level Military Region) and Corps (same as Second-Level Military Region): 165 cm horizontal, 132 cm vertical

　　(3) Army (same as Third-Level Military Region): 160 cm horizontal, 128 cm vertical

　　(4) Division (same as Military Sub-district): 155 cm horizontal, 124 cm vertical

　　(5) Regiment (same as County Command or Armed Forces Department): 150 cm horizontal, 120 cm vertical

Second, Military Emblem

The military emblem of the Chinese People's Liberation Army is a five-pointed red star with a golden-yellow border, with the golden-yellow characters "八一" (8-1) embedded in the center.

(A) When the military emblem is used as a hat badge, its manufacturing method and dimensions are as follows:

　　(1) The radius of the circumference of the five-pointed red star is 15 mm (slightly convex, about 2 mm high). Each angle is 36 degrees, with a golden-yellow border 1.5 mm wide on the outside.

　　(2) "八一" (8-1) are Song typeface Chinese characters, appropriately placed vertically inside the red star.

(B) When the military emblem is used on armbands, certificates, documents, cars, ships, airplanes, and buildings, etc., it shall be enlarged or reduced according to the above-mentioned size ratio.
