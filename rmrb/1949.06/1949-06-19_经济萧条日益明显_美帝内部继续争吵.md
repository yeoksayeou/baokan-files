　　Economic Depression Increasingly Evident
  　Internal Disputes Continue Within US Imperialism
    [Xinhua News Agency, Peiping, 18th] The increasingly deteriorating economic situation in the United States, which has even caused concern among some reactionary Republican senators, has led to continued disputes within the American ruling class among different economic groups. According to a United Press report, Republican Senator Charles admitted in the Senate on the 15th: "The United States may already be on the verge of a depression." He questioned the Senate Democratic leader Lucas, saying: "How will the Truman administration handle this?" Lucas replied evasively: I am optimistic about the future, and the US government has plans in hand. But when Charles further pressed to ask what plans had been formulated, Lucas was at a loss for words. According to a Reuters report on the 15th, Republican Senator Brewster attacked in the Senate "the growing economic depression under the Democratic administration," and said: "We are in a state of depression, this is not a future thing, the existing unemployment has reached four million people, and government experts unanimously believe that the number of unemployed will increase."

　　经济萧条日益明显
  　美帝内部继续争吵
    【新华社北平十八日电】美国经济情势的日益恶化，甚至引起了若干反动的共和党参议员的忧虑，已使美国统治阶级中不同经济集团内部的争吵继续不休。据合众社讯，共和党参议员查理士十五日在参院承认：“美国可能已处于萧条的边缘”。他向参院民主党领袖鲁卡斯提出质问说：“杜鲁门政府对此如何处理？”鲁卡斯支吾其词地答道：我对未来很乐观，美政府现有计划在手。但当查理士进一步追问究竟制订了什么计划时，鲁卡斯却无辞以对。另据路透社十五日讯，共和党参议员布鲁斯特在参院攻击“日益增长的民主党当政下的经济萧条”，并说：“我们是处在萧条的情况中，这并不是将来的事情，现有的失业已达四百万人，政府专家一致认为失业人数还要增加。”
