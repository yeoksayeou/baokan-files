    I shovel coal to keep the fire burning,
    The flames roar high beneath the boiler;
    It is the great heart of the mine,
    We must keep the boiler burning well.
    If the boiler doesn't burn well,
    The generator won't turn, the lights will die,
    The winding engine will stall, the cage will hang,
    The electric locomotive will lose its voice,
    The ventilator will quietly go to sleep.
    I shovel coal to keep the fire burning,
    Unfraid that blisters rise on my hands,
    Ignoring the sweat pouring like rain.
    I and this old boiler
    Have lived together for twenty years,
    I know its temperament;
    If the fire is too small, the steam is weak,
    If the fire is too big, it will explode.
    I shovel coal to keep the fire burning,
    Adding raw coal makes the fire thrive,
    A joyful event leaps in my heart,
    Since liberation of this factory,
    A management committee has been formed,
    And I, the stoker, was also elected.
    The manager and leaders come to meetings,
    We sit at the same table...
    I shovel coal to keep the fire burning,
    The workers say: "Be a good master!"
    Revolutionary competition is in full swing,
    I said:
    "Save a carload of coal a day,
    And the boiler will still burn well;
    Guarantee enough steam for a hundred sheds,
    Give it a bath every ten days."
    I shovel coal to keep the fire burning,
    See the red glow beneath the boiler,
    My heart is on it,
    The generator spins, the lights shine brightly.
    The winding engine lifts coal to the surface,
    The electric locomotive happily "clang, clang" sings,
    The ventilator whirs and chases the wind...
    May, 1949, in the Jiaozuo Mining Area

    我一锨一锨把火烧
    叶枫
    我一锨一锨把火烧，
    锅炉底下火苗高；
    他是矿山大心脏，
    要把锅炉好好烧。
    假若锅炉烧不好，
    电滚不转灯死了，
    高车断气罐上吊，
    电箩不唱哑了嗓，
    风车悄悄睡大觉。
    我一锨一锨把火烧，
    不怕双手磨起大燎泡，
    不顾汗流如雨浇。
    我和这个老锅炉
    一块过活二十年，
    他的皮气我知道；
    火小了气不壮，
    火大了要飞爆。
    我一锨一锨把火烧，
    添上生炭火兴旺，
    有件喜事心头跳，
    自从解放这工厂，
    产生管理委员会
    我烧火的也选上。
    经理领导来开会，
    我们坐到一个桌面上。……
    我一锨一锨把火烧，
    工友们说：“当主人翁要当好！”
    革命竞赛劲头高，
    我说啦：
    “一天节约炭一车，
    锅炉照样烧的好；
    保证烧够百篷气，
    十天给他洗次澡。”
    我一锨一锨把火烧，
    你瞧锅炉肚下闪红光，
    我心操在他身上，
    电滚飞转灯光亮堂堂。
    高车提煤到井上，
    电箩高兴“咣咣”唱，
    风车呼呼撵风跑。……
    一九四九、五、于焦作矿区
