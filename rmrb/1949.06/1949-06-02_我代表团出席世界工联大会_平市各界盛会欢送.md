　　Xinhua News Agency, Beiping, 1st. The Chinese Workers' Delegation attending the World Federation of Trade Unions Congress was warmly seen off by all sectors of the city before their departure. A grand farewell meeting, organized by the All-China Federation of Trade Unions and the Preparatory Committee of the Beiping Municipal Federation of Trade Unions, was held at 8:00 PM on May 31st. Attendees included Li Lisan and Zhu Xuefan, Vice-Chairmen of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, Li Lianshan, Deputy Director of the Preparatory Committee of the Beiping Municipal Federation of Trade Unions, Dong Biwu, Chairman of the North China People's Government, democratic figure Shen Junru, and approximately one thousand representatives from various trade unions, organizations, and guests from Beiping. At the meeting, Li Lisan delivered a farewell speech on behalf of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, stating that the delegation's important task abroad was to strengthen the unity between the Chinese working class and the world's working class and democratic forces, in order to strive for lasting world peace and democracy. He hoped that the delegation would learn from the struggle experiences of working classes in various countries, especially the experience of Soviet workers in building a new country, and, through the World Federation of Trade Unions Congress, introduce the struggle experiences of the Chinese working class in the victorious people's revolution to worker brothers around the world. Liu Ningyi, head of the delegation, stated in his reply that the Chinese Workers' Delegation would do everything possible to strengthen the unity of the world's working class, strengthen the powerful democratic camp centered on Soviet workers and fighting for peace and democracy; and would certainly tell the worker brothers all over the world the experiences and lessons learned by the Chinese workers and the Chinese people in opposing American imperialism and its running dog, the Kuomintang reactionaries. He believed that the unity of the world's workers, led by Soviet workers, would certainly defeat the conspiracies of imperialism and splittists, and achieve world peace and democracy.
