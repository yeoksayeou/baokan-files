　　Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 5th: The remnants of the Kuomintang reactionaries in Guangzhou have begun to scatter and flee. Most of the bandit Guangzhou Pacification Headquarters and puppet provincial government officials have fled. The puppet Legislative Yuan ceased its meetings after it passed a resolution on the 3rd for the bandit Yan Xishan to succeed the bandit He Yingqin as the puppet Executive Yuan President. The puppet legislators are all busy finding transportation to escape. Some bandit gang officials are carrying large amounts of gold, silver, and U.S. dollars to Hong Kong, and are preparing to flee to the United States. Deposits in Hong Kong's British and American banks have therefore increased sharply. It is reported that the deposits in the Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation alone have reached 35 billion Hong Kong dollars.

　　广州匪帮开始逃跑
    【新华社北平五日电】广州的国民党反动派残余已开始逃散。匪广州绥署和伪省府官员已大部逃走。伪立法院于三日通过阎匪锡山继何匪应钦为伪行政院院长后已停会，伪立委们都在忙于找交通工具逃走。若干匪帮官员携带大量金银、美钞涌往香港，并准备逃往美国。香港英美银行的存款因此剧增，据息仅英汇丰银行的存款即已达三百五十亿港币。
