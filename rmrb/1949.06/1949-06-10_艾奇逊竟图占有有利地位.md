Following Vyshinsky's speech, U.S. Secretary of State Acheson spoke next. Acheson first insisted on reorganizing the four-power supervision of the Berlin elections according to new methods, rather than the methods used in 1946. Acheson strongly opposed the Soviet proposal that the German committee guiding the Berlin city elections should be organized on the basis of the principle of parity. He used every means to ensure that the American proposal could be established. The purpose of this proposal was to ensure the favorable position of the authorities in the three Western zones of Berlin during the preparation and conduct of the elections. Acheson also opposed the Soviet suggestion that the right to nominate candidates should be granted not only to political parties, but also to larger public organizations such as the Cultural界联盟 [Cultural Circles Alliance], 民主妇女联盟 [Democratic Women's Alliance] and the 工会 [Trade Union]. Acheson arbitrarily interpreted the Soviet proposal regarding what issues should remain under the jurisdiction of the Four-Power Command and what issues should be transferred to the city's autonomous government. He insisted that the Soviet delegation was trying to give all power completely to the Allied Command. Although Acheson had to admit that the situation in Austria was different from that in Germany, he continued to insist on using the same method of approving municipal government decrees in Berlin as was used for the Austrian government. Acheson also opposed Vyshinsky's suggestion that the new constitution drafted by the City Council should be unanimously approved by the four powers in accordance with Article 35 of the Berlin Provisional Constitution.

Schuman and Bevin spoke after Acheson, and their views were largely the same as Acheson's.

　　艾奇逊竟图占有有利地位
    维辛斯基发言之后，美国务卿艾奇逊继起发言。艾奇逊首先坚持按照新的办法，而不是象一九四六年的方法一样重新组织四国对柏林选举的监督。艾奇逊强力反对苏联关于指导柏林市选举事宜的德国委员会应以对等原则为基础加以组织的建议，他使用一切方法，力图使美国的建议能够成立，该建议的目的是在准备和进行选举期间确保柏林三西占区当局的有利地位。艾奇逊又反对苏联的下述建议，即提出候选人之权不仅应给予各政党，同时也应给予较大的公众团体如文化界联盟、民主妇女联盟和职工会。艾奇逊专断地解释苏联关于什么问题应留给四国司令部管辖什么问题应转交市自治政府管辖的建议，他硬把事情说成是苏联代表团力图把一切权力都完全给盟国司令部。艾奇逊虽然不得不承认奥国的情况与德国的情况不同，但是，他继续坚持在柏林使用与对奥国政府相同的批准市自治政府法令的方法。艾奇逊又反对维辛斯基的下述建议：将由市议会草拟的新宪法，须按照柏林临时宪法第三十五条交四国一致批准。
    舒曼和贝文在艾奇逊之后发言，他们的意见和艾奇逊的意见大致相同。
