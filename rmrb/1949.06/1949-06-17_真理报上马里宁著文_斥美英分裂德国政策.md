Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, June 16th: Moscow dispatch: Pravda published an article by Marinin on the 13th entitled "The US-British Policy of Splitting Germany." Marinin wrote: The United States, Britain, and France have abandoned the Potsdam program and countered it with their own, diametrically opposed program. If the German question is even more acute than before, one of the decisive factors is precisely this anti-Potsdam line of the Western three powers.

The first result of this line is the division of Germany. The result of the development of this line is the establishment of the aggressive North Atlantic Group directed against the Soviet Union and the People's Democracies. Therefore, there is a direct link between the division of Germany and the destruction of international cooperation among major powers, which is the main foundation of lasting peace and international security.

The Western countries stubbornly continue to pursue their chosen anti-Potsdam line. No matter what fine words they use, their main goal remains clear. This goal is to complete the division of Germany. The so-called Occupation Statute and the Bonn Constitution, which the US, British, and French governments imposed on West Germany on the eve of the Four Foreign Ministers Conference in Paris, serve precisely to achieve this goal.

Marinin pointed out: The difference between the Occupation Statute and the Bonn Constitution is merely formal. Both documents were drafted on the orders of the United States and Britain. They can equally be called the "Occupation Statute" and the "Bonn Constitution." Analyzing their substance, it can be seen that the Occupation Statute must be the basis of the West German "Constitution." The Occupation Statute grants the United States, Britain, and France supreme power in West Germany, not to some other German body.

The guidelines for determining the specific tasks and methods of the four-power occupation institutions in Germany were stipulated long ago. These are explained in detail in the decisions of the Potsdam Conference and the regulations of the Control Council. The Occupation Statute makes no mention of these guidelines. The Occupation Statute stipulates that the separate West German state is placed under the supreme power of the US-British bloc. For example, it completely sidesteps the issue of the statute's effective term.

The Occupation Statute grants the US, British, and French authorities in West Germany the following privileges: First, complete control, that is, effectively direct command of all foreign relations, including representing Germany in concluding international agreements. Second, control of foreign trade, monetary activities, and all "foreign interests and rights in Germany." Third, control of internal affairs, including expanding monetary funds, food, and other supplies. Fourth, control of "the implementation of the Basic Law and state constitutions." Fifth, control of the Ruhr. The so-called Ruhr Statute—a major element of the Occupation Statute—has the sole purpose of making the United States the complete master of the entire Ruhr industrial area.

As for the German institutions of the West German "state," the Occupation Statute only gives them "qualifications." They must unconditionally pay all so-called "occupation fees." The conclusion is obvious: the United States, Britain, and France want to establish a typical colonial rule system in the center of Europe.

The Occupation Statute is irreconcilably contradictory to the obligations undertaken by the Western countries to conclude a peace treaty with Germany. General Clay said: "There can be peace without a treaty." In other words, the Occupation Statute demands that the task of concluding a peace treaty with Germany be set aside.

Talking about the Bonn Constitution, Marinin wrote: The Bonn Constitution completes the policy of splitting Germany. Its role is to ensure that the US-British rule in West Germany, based on the Occupation Statute, continues forever. Marinin cited Article 24 of the Bonn Constitution, which stipulates that the so-called "Federal Republic of Germany" first "may, by enacting special laws, transfer its sovereign powers to inter-state institutions, and secondly, may, by joining a collective security system, agree to limit its sovereign powers." Behind every word, the long ears of the true authors of this constitution are indeed revealed. It is as if the fundamental law of a country cannot talk about anything else but only about guaranteeing its sovereignty and the rights of its citizens. However, the creators of the Bonn Occupation Statute do not care about this at all. Their selfish plan is to permanently eliminate Germany's independence.

Marinin further cited the statement issued by the US State Department on April 25, which stated that "the Federal Republic of Germany will sign the European Economic Cooperation Charter and conclude a bilateral agreement with the US government." Marinin pointed out that in the minds of the US and British protectors, this must be one of the first diplomatic legislations of the West German "state." The "Federal Republic" is forced to put its neck into the shackles of the Marshall Plan from the very beginning.

Although the Bonn Constitution has several chapters discussing the central "government," in reality, it is deliberately assigned a purely empty role. The supreme power of the US-British occupation authorities and the state prerogatives generously conferred on the states by the Bonn Constitution undermine the foundation of its possible activities. It should be taken into account that the Occupation Statute stipulates the special control of the US, Britain, and France over the "federal" states.

Article 30 of the Bonn Constitution stipulates that "the exercise of state prerogatives and the completion of state tasks are the duty of the states." This provision convincingly proves that among all possible forms of federalism, what the US-British authorities have imposed on West Germany is precisely the deliberate further encouragement of separatist tendencies and the further undermining of the foundation of a unified Germany.

In the case of modern Germany, striving for maximum federalization can only help reactionary fascist and neo-fascist groups resume activities under the protection of the West German occupation authorities.

The Bonn Constitution is, in essence, profoundly anti-democratic and anti-people in nature. Neither in its preamble nor in its basic chapters can one find anything that guarantees domestic democratic order and friendly policies towards other countries. The Bonn Constitution assigns civil and labor legislation to the states, but it omits such important issues as the right of citizens to work and rest.

Looking through all 146 articles of the Bonn Constitution, there is not a single word that talks about limiting the ruling role of German monopoly capitalists and Junkers. The Bonn Constitution does not change West Germany's original social and economic structure. On the contrary, it carefully protects and strengthens it. It does not infringe upon the rule of the steel magnates, who, in collusion with the Junkers, have always been the brains and soul of German imperialist aggression.

The movement to strive for German unification proves that the German people will never reconcile with this constitution imposed by Bonn, which divides and enslaves Germany.

The Soviet Union has always believed that ensuring German unification and turning it into a peaceful and democratic country is extremely important for the people of all countries (including the German people) and for the cause of international peace and security. This is why the Soviet Union has consistently and now remains faithful to the decisions of the Potsdam Conference, and has consistently and now is still striving to implement this decision most faithfully and strictly. The unification and democratization of Germany, that is, the full implementation of the Potsdam Agreement—this is one of the most fundamental prerequisites for lasting peace and international security.

  　斥美英分裂德国政策
    【新华社北平十六日电】莫斯科讯：真理报于十三日刊载马里宁题为“美英分裂德国的政策”的论文。马里宁写道：美英法抛弃了波茨坦纲领，而以他们自己的恰恰相反的纲领与之相对抗。如果说，德国问题甚至比较以前更为尖锐，则其决定性的因素之一，就正是西方三国这一反波茨坦路线。
    这一路线的第一个结果是德国的分裂。这条路线发展的结果，是建立了以苏联及人民民主国家为对象的侵略性的北大西洋集团。因此，德国的分裂与成为持久和平和国际安全之主要基础的大国国际合作的破坏，两者之间有着直接的联系。
    西方国家顽固地继续奉行他们所选定的反波茨坦路线。无论他们用什么样的漂亮词藻，他们的主要目标仍然是清清楚楚的。这个目标就是完成德国的分裂。美英法政府在巴黎四国外长会议开会前夕强加于西德的所谓占领法规与波恩宪法，其作用正是为了实现这一目标。
    马里宁指出：占领法规与波恩宪法之间的区别，仅仅是形式上的。两个文件都是奉美英之命而作。同样可以把它们叫做“占领法规”和“波恩宪法”。分析一下它们的实质，就会看出占领法规一定是西德“宪法”的基础，占领法规予美英法以在西德的最高权力，而不是予某一其他德国机关以这种权力。
    决定德境四国占领机构之具体任务和方法的准则很早就有规定。这在波茨坦会议的决定和管制委员会的规章中有详尽的解释。占领法规完全不提这些准则。占领法规规定把分立的西德国家置于美英集团的最高权力之下。举例说，它完全撤开法规有效期限的问题。
    占领法规予西德美英法当局以下述特权：一，完全管制，即实际上直接指挥一切对外关系，包括代表德国缔结国际协定。二，管制对外贸易，货币活动和一切“外人在德的利益和权利”。三，管制内政，包括扩大货币基金、粮食及其他供应。四，管制“根本法与州宪法的实施”。五，管制鲁尔。所谓鲁尔法规——占领法规的主要元素——其唯一的意义就是使美国成为整个鲁尔工业的完全的主人。
    至于西德“国家”的德国人的机关，占领法规只给他们以“资格”。它们必须无保留的支付一切所谓“占领费”。结论是很明显的：美英法想在欧洲的中心建立典型的殖民地统治制度。
    占领法规与西方国家所承担的对德缔结和约的义务，不可调和地相矛盾。克莱将军说过：“没有和约也可以有和平。”换句话说，占领法规要求把对德缔结和约的任务撇在一边。
    谈及波恩宪法时，马里宁写道：波恩宪法使分裂德国的政策最后完成。其作用就在使美英在西德以占领法规为基础的统治，永远继续下去。马里宁援引波恩宪法的第二十四条，该条规定，所谓“德意志联邦共和国”，首先“得借颁布特别法律，将其主权交给各州间的机构，其次得借加入集体安全制度，同意限制其主权”。在每一个字的后面，都确实露出了这个宪法的真实作者的长耳朵。好象一个国家的根本法不能够谈别的，而只能谈保证它的主权和它公民的权利。但是，波恩占领法规的创制人对这一点毫不在乎。他们的自私的计划正是永远消灭德国的独立。
    马里宁又援引美国国务院四月二十五日发表的声明，即“德意志联邦共和国，将在欧洲经济合作章程上签字，并与美国政府缔结双边协定”。马里宁提出，在美英保护人的观念里，这必须是西德“国家”第一批外交立法之一。“联邦共和国”被迫一开始就把脖子伸进马歇尔计划的桎梏。
    波恩宪法虽有几章谈到中央“政府”，但在实际上，是故意派给它纯粹落空的角色。美英占领机关的最高权力以及波恩宪法所慷慨地赋予各州的州特权，破坏了它可能活动的基础。应该考虑到，占领法规规定美英法对“联邦”各州的特别管制。
    波恩宪法第三十条规定，“行使州特权及完成州的任务是州的本份”。这一规定令人信服地证明，在一切可能的联邦制形式中，美英当局所强加于西德的，正是蓄意进一步鼓励分裂倾向，进一步破坏统一的德国的基础。
    在现代德国的情况下，力谋最大限度的联邦化，只能有助于反动法西斯的和新法西斯的集团在西德占领当局包庇下恢复活动。
    波恩宪法在实质上，具有深刻的反民主和反人民的性质。在它的序言里面或是在它的各基本章节中间，都找不到一点保证国内民主秩序和对境外其他国家的友好政策的东西。波恩宪法把民事和劳工等等的立法拨归州管，对于这样重要的问题，例如公民的工作、休息权利等却略过不提。
    找遍波恩宪法一百四十六条条文，没有一条有一个字谈到一点限制德国独占资本家和容克贵族的统治作用。波恩宪法不改变西德的原先的社会和经济结构。相反，还小心地保护与加强它。它不侵犯钢铁大王们的统治，这些大王们与容克贵族勾结一起，一直是德国帝国主义侵略的主脑和灵魂。
    争取德国统一的运动证明，德国人民决不会对波恩敕令对这个分裂与奴役德国的宪法调和。
    苏联始终本着这一点，即保证德国统一和将它变成和平民主国家，这对一切国家的人民（包括德国人民在内）以及国际和平与安全的事业都极为重要。这就是为什么苏联一贯并且现在仍然忠实于波茨坦会议的决定，一贯并且现在仍正努力争取最忠实最严格地执行这个决定。德国的统一和民主化，即充分执行波茨坦协定——这便是持久和平与国际安全最基本的先决条件之一。
