    Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, May 31st: According to Agence France-Presse: The Chairman of the Communist Party of West Germany, Lehmann, was illegally arrested by the British occupation authorities in Baden-Baden on the 29th while en route to the Ruhr to attend a meeting of party cadres there. The purpose of this conspiracy by the British occupation authorities is to prevent Lehmann from attending the Third German People's Congress in Berlin. Previously, the British occupation authorities had illegally arrested Lehmann by the police on charges of "defamation" and the Düsseldorf court illegally sentenced Lehmann to three months in prison, but due to the angry protests of the German people, they were forced to restore his freedom after half a month of imprisonment.
