　　New Work on the Chinese Film Scene
    ——Introducing the Dongying Art Film "The Bridge"
    Li Huang
    The Northeast Film Company's first artistic blockbuster "The Bridge" is being shown in Beiping. This film takes as its theme the working class's support for the revolutionary war and the completion of the battle task of repairing the Jiang Bridge. This is the first creative achievement of Dongying comrades in concretely implementing Chairman Mao's literary and artistic policies and direction. It has opened up a new path for the film scene in the liberated areas and the future film scene of New China.

    From the perspective of the theme and positive significance of "The Bridge," it has a high degree of artistic ideology and class character. In terms of the development of the plot of the entire film, the leadership of the Communist Party is very significant and successful. In this film, from the People's Liberation Army advancing into the south of the Yangtze River, the great artillery formation attacking bunkers, capturing prisoners, and transporting wounded soldiers across the river, to the unfolding of the rear factories where workers are organizing steel furnaces, mobilizing organizations, and overcoming all kinds of difficulties with the greatest creativity, until the completion of the steel bridge, supporting the victorious front-line battles, there are the Party and the Party's activists practicing the mass line and fulfilling the leading role of relying on the working class.

    The factory director and group leader Lao Liang are both excellent Communist Party members. In order to take the lead and actively lead all the workers, the factory director is always deeply involved with the workers, helping them, encouraging them, and giving full play to their creativity and the active spirit of the workers after liberation. For the chief engineer who only believed in his own "technology" and "science" and did not understand the power of the working class, he also adopted an appropriate attitude, using his technical design on the one hand, and patiently persuading him and helping him on the other hand, and making him personally experience the collective strength and creative talent of the working class. Finally, he also changed, took off his wool coat and participated in the bridge repair work. Under the factory director's comfort, encouragement, and leadership, group leader Lao Liang, despite being ill, responded to the call of his superiors, braved the wind and cold, overcame various material difficulties, guarded the steel furnace day and night, combined with the active workers of the whole group, educated and persuaded the backward workers. At the most intense time of work, he did not rest for three days and three nights, and finally fainted, which moved all the workers to tears and greatly exerted the collective creative power of the workers.

    From here, we can see that the Party's leadership, as well as how to rely on the working class to complete the great bridge construction project, is correct and strong. And the working class can be resolute from hesitation, collective from individual, overcome difficulties initially to give full play to creativity under the Party's criticism and education so as to complete the arduous task. In this way, this film has a rich and healthy artistic ideology and class character, making the work activities of group leader Lao Liang, Lao Houtou, as well as the active young workers and the masses of workers, have an artistic image and the power to move and educate the vast audience after processing.

    Therefore, from this art film, we can get several lessons: (1) It shows the heroic posture and invincible power of the workers as masters of the new society and pioneers of construction under the leadership of the Party, making the audience feel that only the Chinese Communist Party can lead the people of the whole country to the construction of a new democratic society. (2) It shows that only by accepting the leadership of the Communist Party and combining with the creative power of the working class can the technical chief engineer and the intellectuals in the working masses make their technology more useful, give full play to their power, and work for the interests of the vast majority of the masses. (3) The various scenes, music, and background of this film are magnificent, healthy, and combative, eliminating the delicate and weak flavor that used to dominate the film scene and creating a new style. This style has opened up a bright and grand road for the new film scene in China, as long as it can follow this new road, constantly overcome the shortcomings of unclear pronunciation, not delicate enough performance techniques, and not deep enough characterization of certain characters, it will certainly be able to continue to create films with more educational significance and artistic value than "The Bridge" for the vast masses to enjoy!
    
    Characters, Types, Policies Qian
    Regarding "The Bridge," this art film with workers as the theme, I will only talk about a few scattered impressions here.

    If a successful literary and artistic work mainly lies in writing about characters, writing about typical examples, and reflecting the Party's policies, then "The Bridge" has done a satisfactory job in this regard, especially in Chinese films, it is still the first one.

    Writing about characters, especially writing about new characters - workers - to portray them deeply, specifically, and vividly is indeed not easy. In the past, due to the fact that literary and artistic workers were not very familiar with the lives of workers, there were very few works about workers, and even if there were any, they were not very cordial or realistic, neither donkey nor horse. However, the several main characters in "The Bridge," such as the steelmaking group leader Lao Liang, the riveter group leader Lao Hou, and the director of the railway factory, are all successfully portrayed, so that the audience's emotions develop with their tension or pleasure. This not only embodies Chairman Mao's policy of "literature and art serving the workers, peasants and soldiers," but also achieves success in writing about new characters such as workers.

    Characters, of course, must be portrayed deeply, but the reason why they can move people so deeply lies in the choice of typical examples. Naturally, typical examples are not fabricated out of thin air, but are captured from reality - the product of production struggles or political struggles. For example, "The Bridge" is a vivid portrayal of reality through various typical characters, such as advanced Party members and activists, uniting those in the middle, and winning over those who are backward, fighting against nature and difficulties. The scenes of a few leading all the employees, digging out scrap iron from no confidence, Lao Liang creating refractory bricks to repair the molten steel furnace, and completing the task of repairing the bridge on schedule in order to support the front line, etc., constitute a clear and vivid picture of "labor creating the world."

    More importantly, through these typical characters and stories, it embodies our Party's policy of peaceful construction, the policy of relying on the working class to restore and develop production, the democratization of factory management, and the policy of uniting employees and uniting technical personnel. Except that the process of uniting and transforming engineers is not clear enough, these policies run through the entirety of "The Bridge" like a red line. Therefore, it makes these characters become living characters, and makes this story become a story with a soul, giving people great education and inspiration. With life and soul, coupled with artistic expression, this is the value and greatness of "The Bridge." Unfortunately, during the trial screenings in Beiping, the sound was unclear, the photography was not realistic, and the labor conditions were exaggerated too much, which inevitably affected its artistic and authenticity to a greater or lesser extent.

　　中国影坛的新作
    ——介绍东影艺术片“桥”
    李篁
    东北电影公司第一部艺术巨片“桥”在北平上演了，这是一部以工人阶级支援革命战争、以完成战斗任务抢修江桥为主题的电影，这是东影工作同志具体执行毛主席文艺政策、方向第一次创作的成绩，它给解放区的影坛以及未来新中国的影坛开辟了一条新路。
    从桥的主题以及积极意义上来看，它有高度的艺术思想性与阶级性。从全篇影片情节的发展上，共产党的领导是非常显著而成功的。我们看到这部影片，从人民解放军挺进江南，伟大的炮兵行列打地堡，捉俘虏，运送伤员过江开始，直到展开后方工厂工人整理炼钢炉，发动组织，用最大的创造力克服了种种困难，终于筑成了钢铁大桥，支援了胜利的前方战斗，都有党和党的积极分子在那里实践了群众路线，尽到了依靠工人阶级的领导力量。
    厂长和组长老梁都是优秀的共产党员，为了起带头、积极领导全体工人，厂长时时刻刻地深入工人群众，帮助他们，鼓励他们，发挥他们的创造性以及工人解放后的积极精神；对于那个只信自己的“技术”“科学”，还不懂得工人阶级力量的总工师，也采取了适当的态度，一面运用他的技术设计，一面耐心地说服他、帮助他，并使他亲去体验工人阶级的集体力量与创造才能，最后他也转变了，脱下呢大衣去参加修桥工作。组长老梁在厂长慰问、鼓励、领导下，自己带着病响应上级的号召，冒着风寒克服了各种物质困难条件，日日夜夜地守着炼钢炉旁，结合全组积极工人，教育、说服落后工人，在工作最紧张的时候，他三天三夜没有休息，最后晕倒了，使全体工人感动地流下眼泪，大大地发挥了工人集体创造的力量。
    从这里我们看到党的领导，以及如何依靠工人阶级完成伟大的修桥建设工程是正确的、坚强的。而工人阶级也就能够在党的批评、教育下由犹豫到坚决，由个人到集体，由初步克服困难到发挥创造力以至完成艰巨的任务。这样，就使得这部影片有了丰富的健康的艺术思想性与阶级性。使得组长老梁、老猴头，以及积极的年青工人和全体工人群众的工作活动，具备了艺术的形象与加工后感动、教育广大观众的力量。
    因此，从这部艺术影片里，我们可以得到几点教育：（一）它表现了工人在党的领导下做了新社会的主人，做了建设的先锋的英勇姿态，与不可战胜的力量。使观众感到只有中国共产党才能领导全国人民，走上新民主主义社会的建设。（二）它表现了有技术的总工师以及工人群众中的知识分子，只有接受共产党的领导，和工人阶级的创造力量结合起来，他的技术才能更有用，更能发挥他的力量，进而为最大多数的群众利益去工作。（三）这部影片的各个画面、音乐、背景是雄壮的、健康的、有战斗性的，它扫除了过去在影坛占统治地位的纤细柔弱的风味，创造了一个新的风格。这风格给中国的新影坛开拓了一条光明而壮大的道路，只要能够依照这条新路，不断地克服发音尚不清晰，表现技术尚不够细致，某些人物的性格刻划还不够深刻等缺点，一定能够继续创作出比“桥”更有教育意义及艺术价值的影片给广大群众来欣赏！
    人物、典型、政策　谦
    关于“桥”这部以工人为主题的艺术影片，这里我只谈谈几点零碎的观后感。
    如果说一部成功的文艺作品，主要在于写人物、写典型而又能体现党的政策的话，那么“桥”在这一方面是做的令人满意的，特别是在中国影片来说，还是第一部。
    写人物，特别是写新的人物——工人，要刻划得深刻、具体、生动，的确是不容易的。过去由于文艺工作者大都不很熟悉工人生活，写工人的作品很少，有也不很亲切、逼真，非驴非马。但在“桥”里的几个主要人物，如化钢组长老梁、铆工组长老侯、铁路工厂厂长等人，都是刻划得成功的，使观众的感情，随着他们的紧张或愉快而发展着。这不仅体现了毛主席“文艺为工农兵服务”的方针，而且写工人这样的新人物也获得成效。
    人物，固然要刻划得深刻，但其所以能感人之深，还在于典型的选择，自然，典型不是凭空捏造来的，而是现实的摄取——生产斗争或政治斗争的产物，如“桥”就是通过先进的党员和积极分子、团结中间的、争取落后的各种典型人物，向自然、向困难进行斗争的一部活生生的现实写照。由少数带动全体职工，由没信心到挖出废铁，由老梁创造耐火砖修复熔钢炉，以及为了支援前线，如期完成修桥的任务等等场面，正构成了“劳动创造世界”这样一幅鲜明生动的图画。
    更重要的是通过这些典型的人物和故事，体现了我党和平建设的政策、依靠工人阶级恢复和发展生产的政策、工厂管理民主化以及团结职工、团结技术人员的政策，除对团结改造工程师的过程还不够明鲜外，这些政策均贯穿了“桥”的全部，象一条红线一样。因之，使这些人物变成活的人物，使这部故事变成有灵魂的故事，对人给以很大的教育和奋发。有了生命，有了灵魂，加以艺术的表现，这就是“桥”的价值和伟大处。可惜，在北平试演时，声音不清，摄影不真，以及过份地夸大了劳动条件，不免或多或少地影响到它的艺术性和真实性。
