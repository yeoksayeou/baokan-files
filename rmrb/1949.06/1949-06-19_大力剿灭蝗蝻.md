Short Essay

　　The current locust plague, from the perspective of the season in which it is occurring, is still in its initial stage; however, the affected areas have already spread to forty-one counties, and the severity of the situation should attract sufficient attention from all regions! According to investigations, the locust nymphs currently occurring in various regions are mostly third- and fourth-instar nymphs, with relatively low mobility, making this the best time for elimination. If we are negligent in eliminating them now and miss the opportunity, once the nymphs turn into flying locusts, they will be difficult to control and will inevitably spread to other vast areas, while also creating the root cause for a second outbreak of autumn locusts this year. Therefore, eliminating the nymphs within the forty-one counties where most locusts originate is the primary task in eliminating locust nymphs this year. The counties that have already experienced nymphs must clearly recognize the importance of this responsibility and take the initiative to mobilize and organize the masses to vigorously eliminate them. The administrative offices, provinces, and neighboring counties should make every effort to assist and cooperate in the elimination, ensuring that locust nymphs are eliminated locally and prevented from spreading!
    In terms of elimination methods, as introduced in the article "Eradicating Locust Nymphs" on page four of today's newspaper, the main reliance is on the power of the masses and mass creativity. We have overcome various disasters countless times in the past, and this year we have also overcome severe droughts, wind, frost, hail, and other insect pests. The thriving seedlings in the fields today are the victorious achievements of our leadership in leading the masses to fight against nature. We should carry forward past experiences and make good use of various indigenous methods and newly available effective agents (the pest control team dispatched by the Agricultural Department of the North China People's Government, composed of Peking University and Tsinghua University, is doing a good job by carrying medicine and equipment to eliminate nymphs). We should mobilize all the people with full confidence to eradicate locust nymphs. Currently, weeding is a common and important task in various regions, while eliminating locusts and protecting seedlings is an urgent task for locust-affected areas and their surrounding areas, and no negligence is allowed!

### 大力剿灭蝗蝻

　　大力剿灭蝗蝻
    目前的蝗害，从发生的季节上来说，虽仍属开始阶段；但其发生的地区则已广及四十一县，其严重情况应当引起各地足够的注意！据调查现在各地所发生之蝗蝻，还多是三、四龄的蝻子，活动力较小，故而是除治上最好的时机，如果现在疏于剿除，而使时机错过，蝻子一旦变成飞蝗，则不易扑打，势必延害其他广大地区，同时也便造成今年第二次发生秋蝗为害的祸根。因此把蝻子消灭，在目前发生的大多是蝗虫发源地的四十一县范围内，乃是今年剿灭蝗蝻的第一要著。已发生蝻子各县，要明确认清这种职责的重大，领导上亲自动员组织群众大力剿除，而行署、省区以及邻近县份，则应尽力帮助和协同配合剿除，务使蝗蝻就地消灭而勿使蔓延！
    在剿除方法上，正如今天本报四版“扑灭蝗蝻”一文中所介绍，主要是依靠群众力量和群众性的创造。我们过去曾无数次的战胜了各种灾害，在今年也曾战胜了严重的旱灾以及风、冻、雹灾和其他虫害，今天田中茁壮的禾苗，就是我们领导群众向自然斗争的胜利成绩。我们应该发扬过去的经验，并善为利用各种土法和新有的有效药剂（华北人民政府农业部派出之北大、清大等组成的除虫队携带药具前往灭蝻是很好的），应动员全体人民以饱满的信心，灭绝蝗蝻。目前锄苗是各地普遍的重要工作，而灭蝗保苗尤为蝗区及其附近区的紧急任务，不可有丝毫疏忽！
