    [Hebei-Chahar-Hebei Electric] Under the guidance and assistance of the People's Government, gold shops and jewelry stores in various parts of Hebei-Chahar-Hebei have shifted to industrial and commercial operations that are beneficial to the national economy and the people's livelihood. Ding County's Zhengtong Silver Shop was converted into a iron and woodwork business producing waterwheel buckets on June 10th, with quick production and sales. Xinglong Silver Shop was converted to general merchandise business, Jiyuheng was converted to thread business, and the remaining seven gold and silverware businesses in the city are also preparing to switch businesses. Cang City's Yifengyong Silver Shop was converted into a knitting business last month, and has already knitted and sold many socks. Anguo's Hengchang Silver Shop, after selling most of its finished products in May, is also preparing to switch to the cloth business. Fourteen silver shops in Shengfang City have also begun to switch businesses, with Chunde Building converting to making copper and iron spoons. In order to encourage the industry to switch businesses, the People's Bank of Hebei-Chahar-Hebei's various branches offer preferential exchange rates for existing gold and silver jewelry to those holding letters of introduction from the local government.
