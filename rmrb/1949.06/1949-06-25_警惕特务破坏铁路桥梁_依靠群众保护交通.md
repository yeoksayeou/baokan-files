    Be Vigilant Against Spies Sabotaging Railway Bridges
    Rely on the Masses to Protect Transportation
    The report published today in this newspaper regarding the Taihang Fourth Administrative Office uncovering a case of spies plotting to blow up the Yellow River Railway Bridge illustrates that at this time when the entire country is about to achieve victory, the remaining bandits are attempting to make a last-ditch struggle, instigating spies to carry out their sabotage activities in a more concealed manner. At the same time, it also demonstrates that if Party, government, military, and civilians in all regions raise their vigilance and strengthen security work, they will be able to prevent and capture [the spies] in advance, making it difficult for the spies' conspiracies to succeed.
    According to reports from various sources, the current covert activities of the spies are mainly sabotage and assassination, attempting to destroy our economic construction and transportation construction, assassinate our revolutionary workers and revolutionary people, disrupt our revolutionary order, and harm our revolutionary forces. Fortunately, the Party, government, military, and civilians in various regions are united and vigilant, strengthening security work, preventing some unnecessary losses, and uncovering several sabotage plots by spies. The case of the Taihang uncovering the plot to blow up the Yellow River Railway Bridge is one of the crimes of the spies conspiring to sabotage our transportation construction. For example, the Niujiao River Railway Bridge on the Handan-Shexian Railway connecting Hebei and Henan provinces, although not a large railway bridge, was subjected to repeated explosions by spies last year. The viciousness of their plan can be imagined!
    Therefore, we hope that the Party, government, military, and civilians in all regions will further raise their vigilance, learn to resolutely fight against hidden spies, maintain the public security of cities and villages, and protect the safety of factories and transportation! We should mobilize the masses, develop and strengthen mass security work, and be especially vigilant against spy sabotage in all major transportation routes and important bridge locations. We must closely cooperate with the local public security departments, work together, and use the most effective methods to actively protect transportation and bridges, forming a mass movement to cherish and protect transportation.

    警惕特务破坏铁路桥梁
    依靠群众保护交通
    本报今日发表之太行四专署破获特务阴谋爆炸黄河大铁桥一案的报导，说明在此全国即将胜利的时候，残余匪帮妄图垂死挣扎，唆使匪特更加隐蔽的进行其破坏活动；同时，也说明了各地党政军民如果提高警惕，加强保卫工作，则必能事先防范，加以捕获，而使匪特阴谋难逞。
    据各方报导，目前匪特的隐蔽活动，主要是破坏与暗害，妄图破坏我们的经济建设和交通建设，暗害我们的革命工作人员和革命人民，扰乱我们的革命秩序，损害我们的革命力量，幸我各地党政军民团结警惕，加强保卫工作，防止了若干不必要的损失，又破获了若干匪特的破坏阴谋。太行破获的爆炸黄河大铁桥案，便是匪特们阴谋破坏我们交通建设的罪行之一。如贯通河北河南的邯涉铁路牛角河铁桥，虽是个不大的铁桥，但在去年即曾遭受匪特再次的爆炸。其计之毒，可以想见！
    因此，我们希望各地党政军民更加提高警惕，学会与隐蔽的匪特坚决斗争，维护城市与农村的治安，保护工厂与交通的安全！我们应该发动群众，开展和加强群众性的保卫工作，在各交通要道、重要桥梁所在地之处，必须加倍警惕匪特破坏，必须密切配合当地公安部门，协同一致，用最有效的办法积极保护交通与桥梁，形成一个群众性的爱护交通保护交通运动。
