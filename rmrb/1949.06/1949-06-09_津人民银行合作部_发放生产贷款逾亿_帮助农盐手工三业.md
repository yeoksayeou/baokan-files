　　Tianjin People's Bank Cooperative Department
  　Issues Over 100 Million in Production Loans to Support Agriculture, Salt Production, and Handicraft Industries
    [Tianjin News] Since its opening on March 1st, the Cooperative Department of the Tianjin People's Bank has issued agricultural loans of 35.53 million yuan, handicraft industry loans of over 41.25 million yuan, and salt industry loans of over 23.67 million yuan by the end of May. The total amount of the three items is over 100.45 million yuan.

    Agricultural loans are provided in both real value lending and real value repayment forms. To accommodate the seasonality of farming, the repayment period is set within one month after harvest. The main purpose of agricultural loans is to help solve the difficulties faced by suburban farmers in spring plowing, such as fertilizers, seeds, farm tools, and water conservancy. According to the department's survey, 8,329 farmers (excluding family members) have benefited, and the benefited cultivated land area totals 47,823 mu. The majority of the farmers who received loans are poor peasants and hired farmhands.

    In terms of handicraft industry production loans, 342 households have benefited, including 15 industries such as textiles, sewing, export manufacturing, kiln industry, ironwork, leather, and chemical industry. These loans not only solved the financial difficulties of handicraft production, but also cooperated with cadres in various districts to gradually organize scattered handicraft production into cooperative production. Therefore, in addition to providing maximum convenience in terms of loans, the department also assists each loan recipient in calculating costs, handling accounting, and organizing production and marketing cooperatives.

    Salt industry loans have solved the production difficulties of more than 260 salt fields in Hangu, Dagu, and Tanggu. In Hangu alone, the livelihood problems of 5,674 long-term and short-term workers have been resolved. After receiving loans, each salt field plans to increase production. Hangu plans to produce 5 million dan this year, Tanggu plans to produce 1.95 million dan, and Daqinghe plans to produce 500,000 dan. Salt fields that have been shut down will be gradually restored.

　　津人民银行合作部
  　发放生产贷款逾亿　帮助农盐手工三业
    【天津讯】本市人民银行合作部，自三月一日开始营业以来，截至五月底止，已先后发放农业贷款三千五百五十三万元，手工业贷款四千一百二十五万余元，盐业贷款二千三百六十七万余元。三项合计，共发放贷款一万万零四十五万余元。
    农业贷款采取折实贷款及贷实还实两种方式。为了照顾农耕的季节性，归还期限定在收获后一月内。农业贷款的主要目的，是帮助解决市郊农民在春耕中肥料、种籽、农具和水利等困难问题。根据该部调查，受益农民达八千三百二十九人（家属未计在内），受益耕地面积共四万七千八百二十三亩。得到贷款的农民绝大部分是贫雇农。
    手工业生产贷款方面，受益户共三百四十二家，包括纺织、缝纫、出口制造、窑业、铁工、皮革和化学工业等十五种工业，此项贷款，不仅解决了手工业生产的资金困难，而且配合各区干部，把分散的手工业生产逐步组织起来，成为合作生产，因此该部除在贷款方面给以尽量的方便外，并协助各贷款户计算成本，处理会计，组织产销合作社。
    盐业贷款则解决了汉沽、大沽、塘沽二百六十多个盐滩生产的困难，仅汉沽滩，即有长短工五千六百七十四人的生活问题得到解决。各滩得到贷款后，都计划增加生产，汉沽滩本年度计划生产五百万担，塘沽滩计划生产一百九十五万担，大清河滩计划生产五十万担。已停产的盐滩即可陆续恢复起来。
