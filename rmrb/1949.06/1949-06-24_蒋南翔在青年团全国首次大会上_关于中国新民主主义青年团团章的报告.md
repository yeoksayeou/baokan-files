    Jiang Nanxiang's Report on the Constitution of the Chinese New Democratic Youth League at the First National Congress of the Youth League
    (April 13, 1949) (Continued)

    (4) Added that working youth, revolutionary young soldiers, revolutionary intellectual youth, and revolutionary staff members can apply to join the League according to the procedures for joining the League, "but those who have certain conditions that are not sufficient to be formal members (especially in newly developed areas) may join the League as probationary members, with a probationary period of three months."

    Will stipulating a three-month probationary period for the above-mentioned youth hinder the widespread development of the Youth League? No, it won't. Because this only stipulates a probationary period for those who can basically voluntarily join the League but have certain shortcomings that are not sufficient to be formal members, and does not limit other large numbers of revolutionary youth who meet the conditions from joining the League without a probationary period in accordance with the regulations. This provision of a probationary period is precisely to facilitate the broader absorption and connection of youth with poorer conditions, so that they can formally join the League after a certain period of education and testing during the probationary period.

    In addition, will stipulating that those who voluntarily join the League but do not meet the conditions to be formal members can be probationary members, thereby lowering the level of the Youth League and losing the advanced role that the Youth League should have, like the Youth Salvation Association in the liberated areas in the late Anti-Japanese War? No, it won't. Because the Youth Salvation Association registered names and called on all youth to participate. The Youth League is to be based on the individual's certain degree of awareness, and after individual review, discussion and approval by the League branch, and approval by the League district committee, can they join the League as formal members or probationary members. The principled difference between the Youth League and the Youth Salvation Association in terms of organization is very obvious.

    For those youth who voluntarily join the League, but have certain conditions that are not sufficient to be formal members, if they are not absorbed as probationary members, then there are only two paths: either reluctantly absorbing them as formal members, which will inevitably lower the level of formal members; or temporarily abandoning them, completely abandoning or relaxing the opportunity to strive for the education of these youth. Both of these approaches are obviously not very appropriate. As for how to determine the criteria for requiring a probationary period or not, the leading organs of the Youth League in various localities should stipulate it according to the specific circumstances.

    (B) Regarding the obligations of League members:

    The original draft of the League Constitution stipulated four items, which were relatively simple. Now five items are stipulated. In terms of content, the following have been added: "(3) Actively participate in various construction works of the New Democratic state, work hard in production and labor, oppose idleness, discrimination against women, feudal superstition, and all other corrupt and degenerate behaviors." "(4) Cherish the property of the people and the state, consciously abide by various revolutionary orders and disciplines, and fight against all behaviors that damage the property of the people and the state and disrupt public order." These reflect the needs of the new revolutionary situation. Because the people's democratic revolution is about to win a nationwide victory, the tasks of actively participating in various construction works of the New Democratic state and cherishing the property of the people and the state are increasingly urgently presented to the Chinese people and Chinese youth in order to build a new China.

    II. The Nature of the Chinese New Democratic Youth League

    In the resolution on the establishment of the League announced by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China on New Year's Day this year, and in the political report made by Comrade Ren Bishi to our representative conference, the nature of the Chinese New Democratic Youth League has been clearly explained. The Chinese New Democratic Youth League is a mass organization of advanced youth led by the Communist Party of China, guided by the ideology of the proletariat, based on young workers, young peasants, and young revolutionary intellectuals, widely uniting advanced youth from all walks of life, and striving for the complete realization of New Democracy.

    The following issues need to be explained separately:

    (1) On the issue of the leadership of the Communist Party of China. -- Why must the Chinese New Democratic Youth League be led by the Communist Party of China? Is it possible not to have the leadership of the Communist Party?

    Answer: The revolutionary history of China over the past 100 years, especially the past 30 years, proves that without the leadership of the Communist Party of China, the Chinese revolutionary movement would be difficult to succeed, and the true liberation of the Chinese people and Chinese youth would not be possible. Over the past 30 years, what Chinese youth have received from the Northern Warlords and the Kuomintang reactionaries are unspeakable treason, dictatorship, and bloody crimes of slaughtering youth. Only the Communist Party of China has consistently warmly sympathized with and supported the patriotic movements of youth, and has pointed out the correct direction of struggle for youth, guiding them towards victory and towards brightness. The great victory of the Chinese revolution and the great future of Chinese youth are inseparable from the correct leadership of the Communist Party of China. Therefore, it is a logical conclusion that Chinese youth are willing to trust the leadership of the Communist Party of China completely and without reservation.

    Will the Youth League's public declaration of accepting the leadership of the Communist Party of China cause doubts among the youth masses, thereby weakening the mass character of the Youth League?

    Answer: In the past, in areas under the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang, when the mass movement led by the Communist Party had to be underground, some politically backward masses lacked understanding of the revolutionary nature of the Communist Party and lacked confidence in the inevitable victory of the revolutionary movement led by the Communist Party. There used to be a mentality of fearing and not wanting to get close to the Communist Party, but this situation has long undergone fundamental changes. Now, the Communist Party of China is the leading party that plays a decisive role in Chinese political life. The Communist Party of China's loyalty to the cause of the liberation of the Chinese people and its great contributions have been generally recognized and supported by the people and youth across the country. Now it is no longer a question of whether the youth masses fear or do not want to get close to the Communist Party, but rather that the broad masses of youth are eagerly looking forward to the leadership and education of the Communist Party. Under these circumstances, the Youth League will never weaken its mass base because it is led by the Communist Party. On the contrary, it can only do its work better, thereby gaining more support from the broad masses and ensuring the broad development of the Youth League. The actual development of the Youth League has fully confirmed this point for us.

    (2) The issue of taking the proletarian ideological system as the guiding ideology -- In order to keep the youth movement on a completely correct path of development, the Youth League must, in addition to politically supporting the New Democratic Program and the Communist Party's various specific policies and resolutions, also handle all issues based on the proletarian Marxist-Leninist viewpoint, systematically conduct ideological education on dialectical materialism and historical materialism, and help League members establish a revolutionary worldview, outlook on life, and correct way of thinking, so that they have revolutionary patriotism and internationalism, have a serious attitude towards work and life, and can be trained to become revolutionary fighters who are both ideologically and physically sound. Only in this way can the Youth League truly be worthy of being a school for educating youth with the spirit of Marxism-Leninism.

    (3) On the issue of being based on young workers, young peasants, and young revolutionary intellectuals -- The organization of the Youth League is based on young workers, young peasants, and young revolutionary intellectuals, which shows that the social foundation of the Youth League is not narrow but broad. There is an opinion that the Youth League is a mass organization of the proletariat. This understanding is not entirely appropriate, because the main organizational components of the Youth League not only include workers who belong to the proletariat, but also young peasants and young revolutionary intellectuals who do not belong to the proletariat, as well as democratic youth from other social strata. This is obviously different from mass organizations of a proletarian nature, such as trade unions. It is true that the Youth League is led by the Communist Party and guided by the proletarian ideological system, but this is only to regard raising all League members to the ideological level of proletarian Marxism-Leninism as the goal that the Youth League hopes to achieve, and does not mean that youth from any class or with different political levels have become proletarians or possess the high level of proletarian ideological level of a Communist Party member once they join the League.

    There is also an opinion that young workers can be organized in trade unions, young peasants can be organized in peasant associations, and the Youth League only needs to target young students as its main object and does not need to carry out work and establish organizations among young workers and peasants. This understanding is also inappropriate. The Youth League is an assistant in all aspects of the Communist Party and the people's democratic government's great cause of building a New Democratic China, and it obviously cannot limit its work position and organizational foundation to the small circle of intellectual youth. At the same time, the Youth League is composed of advanced elements among the young workers, peasants, and intellectuals. In various tasks, they actively respond to the various calls of the Communist Party and the people's government, play the vanguard role and leading role unique to youth, and become a shock force. This shock force role of the Youth League is obviously not something that can be completely replaced by mass organizations of workers and peasants such as trade unions and peasant associations. Therefore, the Youth League should pay great attention to carrying out work and developing organizations among young workers and peasants. Especially with the development of the revolutionary situation, today when the focus of the Communist Party's work has shifted from the countryside to the cities, strengthening the work of the Youth League among young workers is of particularly urgent and important significance.

    In addition, there is no consensus on how to define the scope of revolutionary intellectuals and whether they can become the foundation of the Youth League. We need to study this issue in particular:

    What are "revolutionary intellectuals"? All intellectuals who truly support the revolution and have actual actions can be called revolutionary intellectuals. Those who actually participated in the revolutionary movement before liberation and are still continuing revolutionary work are naturally revolutionary intellectuals; those who did not participate in revolutionary work before liberation, but after liberation, because they were influenced or educated by the revolution, began to support the Communist Party and the New Democratic Program, and have concrete manifestations, such as actively working under the leadership of the Communist Party and the people's democratic government, or studying hard in schools that implement the New Democratic education policy, and can serve the revolutionary construction cause in the future, can also be listed as revolutionary intellectuals.

    Our current explanation of "revolutionary intellectuals" appears to be broader than the generally understood standards in the past. The reason is that the revolution has now achieved a decisive victory nationwide, the Communist Party has become the leading party in Chinese political life, and the Communist Party of China has established the highest prestige and the most widespread and in-depth influence among the Chinese people. This new situation has fundamentally changed the social status of Chinese intellectuals in an invisible way. In the old China ruled by the Kuomintang reactionaries, the path for intellectuals to serve the people was blocked, and the entire society was driving them away from the people's position and to attach themselves to the reactionary class. Therefore, only a small part of intellectuals who persisted in the heroic revolutionary struggle could obtain the title of "revolutionary intellectuals." However, under the people's democratic regime led by the Communist Party, the situation is completely different. Here, the revolutionary path for intellectual youth to serve the people is unimpeded. Except for a very small number of die-hard reactionary elements, the vast majority of intellectuals will be able to actively participate in various revolutionary works under the leadership and encouragement of the Communist Party and the people's democratic government and become revolutionary intellectuals. When Chinese intellectuals can more widely and universally participate in the revolution objectively, we should sincerely welcome them so that they can join hands with other revolutionary people, mainly workers and peasants, and play a greater role in the revolutionary movement. Our current broad explanation of revolutionary intellectuals reflects this new situation and new needs. Otherwise, not only will the demands of a large number of intellectuals who are willing and able to participate in the revolution not be met, but it will also be a major loss to the revolutionary cause.

    Of course, the scope of revolutionary intellectuals is wider than in the past, but it does not mean that the necessary conditions that revolutionary intellectuals should have are lowered or even abandoned, believing that all students in liberated area schools and other intellectuals, including students and other intellectuals in newly liberated areas, regardless of their actual political attitude, have all unconditionally become revolutionary intellectuals. Now, as in the past, the requirement for revolutionary intellectuals is to sincerely support the people's revolutionary cause and be willing to strive for its realization. It is just that now the subjective forces and political influence of the revolution are stronger, making it possible for intellectuals to more widely and universally accept the baptism of the revolution, so the scope of revolutionary intellectuals has naturally been greatly expanded compared to the past. Moreover, in the future, as the revolutionary situation continues to develop, the scope of revolutionary intellectuals will continue to expand, until all intellectuals, under the systematic leadership and education of the Communist Party, unanimously support the revolution and fight for the revolutionary cause, becoming revolutionary intellectuals. At this time, the so-called revolutionary intellectuals will no longer be necessary. Because all intellectuals are revolutionary, there is no need to specifically mark the word "revolutionary," as the current Soviet Union is an example.

    Of course, the League Constitution stipulates that revolutionary intellectuals are one of the foundations of the Youth League, but it does not mean that all revolutionary intellectuals are unconditionally absorbed into the League, just as the Youth League is based on young workers and peasants, but it does not mean that all young workers and peasants are unconditionally absorbed into the League. It is merely said that in addition to young workers and peasants, the Youth League should also take revolutionary intellectuals as its main development object. As for when recruiting members from them, of course, without exception, they must be based on each person's conscious willingness and complete the procedures for joining the League stipulated in the League Constitution before they can join the League.

    (4) On the issue of widely uniting advanced youth from all walks of life -- The Youth League has a very broad mass character. In addition to a large number of absorbing young workers and peasants and young revolutionary intellectuals, as long as advanced youth from other democratic parties and non-party members in China other than the Communist Party are willing to strive for the realization of New Democracy, agree with the Youth League's work program and organizational charter, and are willing to abide by the Youth League's discipline and implement the Youth League's resolutions, they can also apply to join the League. But on the other hand, the Youth League also has revolutionary and progressive characteristics. All reactionary and backward youth will not be able to join the ranks of the Chinese New Democratic Youth League. If youth belonging to reactionary parties and associations want to join the Youth League, they must undergo a more careful examination to truly prove that they have no ideological and organizational ties with the reactionary parties, and can only be approved to join the League after completing the procedures stipulated in the League Constitution.

    (5) The difference between the New Democratic Youth League and the past Communist Youth League -- The difference between the Chinese New Democratic Youth League and the past Chinese Communist Youth League is in two aspects. One is the difference in program. The Communist Youth League took the recognition of the Communist program as a prerequisite for joining the League, and the New Democratic Youth League took the recognition of the New Democratic program as a prerequisite for joining the League. The second is the difference in organizational foundation. The Communist Youth League in principle took young workers and peasants as the main body, while the New Democratic Youth League was based on young workers, peasants, and young revolutionary intellectuals, and at the same time widely united advanced youth from all walks of life, including youth from various democratic parties who agreed with the New Democratic Common Program. From these two aspects, we can know that the New Democratic Youth League is broader than the past Communist Youth League, which is completely in line with the objective environment and actual needs of China's New Democratic period.

    However, the New Democratic Youth League is only different from the past Communist Youth League in terms of the broadness of the political program and social foundation. As for the basic nature and main task of these two groups -- as the core organization for uniting youth under the leadership of the Communist Party and a revolutionary school for educating youth with Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought -- they are completely consistent.

    III. The Basic Organizational Principle of the Youth League -- Democratic Centralism

    The organizational principle of the New Democratic Youth League is democratic centralism.

    The Youth League's Constitution, on the one hand, fully reflects the democratic spirit within the League, and on the other hand, reflects the high degree of organizational centralization.

    The democratic spirit of the Youth League is reflected in the following aspects:

    (1) All levels of leadership organs are generated through elections. Every formal member of the Youth League has the right to vote and be elected, and everyone is one of the masters of the Youth League.

    (2) All levels of the League's leadership organs implement a committee system and collective leadership system. Decisions on various major issues must be made in a democratic manner and based on the opinions of the majority. No one can make arbitrary decisions.

    (3) League members can freely express their opinions in League meetings, discuss various issues, put forward any suggestions, criticize any staff, and appeal their opinions to higher levels (of course, if the speech or criticism is wrong, others also have the right to defend and correct it).

    (4) Regularly convene League member conferences and League representative conferences at all levels to review and determine the work of the League at all levels. All levels of leadership organs must be responsible to the League member conferences and League representative conferences at all levels, implement their resolutions, and accept their supervision.

    (5) Recognize that young people outside the League and the general masses of people have the right to criticize and suggest the work and organization of the League, and can invite them to attend the League branch meetings or representative conferences at all levels. This allows the Youth League to more widely listen to the opinions of the masses, gather wisdom, and fully promote the democratic spirit.

    The organizational centralization of the Youth League is reflected in the following aspects:

    (1) Only those who are willing to actively strive for the revolutionary cause of New Democracy, willing to faithfully serve the working people, recognize the League Constitution, obey resolutions, and participate in the work of the League can apply to join the League. Those with reactionary thoughts cannot join the League; they cannot join the League without completing the procedures for joining the League stipulated in the League Constitution; those who do not participate in the work of the League for four months without a legitimate reason cannot continue to maintain League membership; if there are serious errors that violate the League Constitution and League discipline, they will be punished, from admonishment to expulsion.

    (2) Youth League members must strictly abide by the League's internal order: the minority obeys the majority, the lower level obeys the higher level, and the individual obeys the organization. For the decision of all issues in the League, there may be dissenting opinions during the discussion, but once the majority passes or the higher level approves, it must be unconditionally implemented. It is allowed to reserve opinions, but it is not allowed to insist on one's own opinions and act alone; in order to ensure the unity of the Youth League in organization and action, so that it can fight forward in any environment.

    Democracy and centralization appear to be opposed in form, but in essence they are combined and unified. In the organizational life of the Youth League, on the one hand, we must fully promote democracy, ensure the democratic rights of every League member, and oppose all undemocratic styles of making arbitrary decisions without respecting the will of others; on the other hand, we must have centralization, and the minority must obey the majority, the lower level must obey the higher level, and the individual must obey the organization. Democracy and centralization are combined with each other and serve a common and consistent goal -- to ensure the greatest interests of the greatest number of people. Therefore, democratic centralism is the organizational principle that reflects the greatest interests of the greatest number of people. Only revolutionary organizations that truly represent the interests of the majority can truly use democratic centralism. The internal life of the Youth League must correctly reflect the spirit of democratic centralism, and combine a high degree of democratic life with a high degree of organization. This is the source of the Youth League's abundant vitality.

    IV. The Organizational Independence of the Youth League

    The resolution of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China on the establishment of the Chinese New Democratic Youth League pointed out: "The Chinese New Democratic Youth League accepts the leadership of the Communist Party of China politically, but should maintain its own independent system organizationally."

    Comrade Ren Bishi pointed out in the political report to this representative conference: "A clear distinction should also be made between the due independence of youth organizations and the tendency to 'make independence' (youthism tendency). The tendency to 'make independence' should be opposed, but at the same time, attention should be paid to respecting the due independence of youth organizations in organization." How to understand the organizational independence of the Youth League is a matter of concern to everyone. Now we need to point out the following three points: First, under the premise of implementing the general policies and general tasks of the Communist Party of China, the Youth League needs to have its own independent work and activities. Second, the Youth League itself is an independent organization, therefore, within its own organizational system, the Youth League should have the power to appropriately adjust and transfer its own cadres. Third, the Youth League should have its own certain budget of funds in order to actively and systematically carry out work.

    The above three points naturally do not completely and without omission summarize the entire content of the "independence" of the Youth League in organization, but because these issues often cause misunderstandings and disputes in actual work, they are particularly explained.

    The Youth League's retention of its necessary independence in activities, cadre transfers, and budget of funds is by no means to leave the leadership of the Party in work, or to contradict the general tasks stipulated by the Party, but merely to fully exert the enthusiasm and creativity of youth in order to better cooperate with the completion of the Party's general tasks.

    The work of establishing the Youth League has just begun, and our experience is still very limited. Not only are there many problems that have not been solved, but even many problems have not been raised. This can only be discovered, studied, and resolved in more in-depth work in the future.

    蒋南翔在青年团全国首次大会上
    关于中国新民主主义青年团团章的报告
    （一九四九年四月十三日）（续）
    （４）增加了劳动青年、革命青年军人、革命知识青年、革命职员按照入团手续申请入团，“但其有某些条件尚不够为正式团员者（特别在新发展区域中），得加入本团为候补团员，候补期为三个月。”一项。
    对于上述青年规定需要三个月候补期，会不会妨碍青年团的广泛发展呢？不会的。因为这里只是对于那些基本上可以志愿入团但有某些缺点尚不够为正式团员者规定了候补期，并不限止其他条件足够的大批革命青年可以无候补期的照章入团。这种候补期的规定，正是一方面便于更广泛的吸收和联系条件较差的青年，使他们能在候补期内经过一定的教育和考验而后正式入团。
    另外，规定志愿入团而条件尚不够为正式团员者得为候补团员，会不会因而降低青年团的水平，象抗战后期解放区的青救会那样丧失了青年团所应有的先进作用呢？不会的。因为青救会是登名造册，号召全体青年参加的。青年团是要根据本人具有一定觉悟程度，并经过个别审查，团的支部讨论通过，团的区委批准等手续，才能入团为正式团员或候补团员。青年团和青救会在组织上的原则性区别是十分显然的。
    对于那些志愿入团，而有某些条件还不够为正式团员的青年，如果不吸收他们做为候补团员，那就只有两条道路：或者是勉强吸收他们为正式团员，这就不免要降低正式团员的水平；或者是暂时将他们摒弃不顾，根本放弃或放松对于这些青年的争取教育机会。这两种处理办法显然都不是很妥当的。至于要候补期与不要候补期的标准如何确定，应由各地青年团的领导机关根据具体情况规定之。
    （乙）关于团员的义务：
    原来的团章草案上规定了四项，比较简单，现在规定了五项，在内容上增加了“（三）积极参加新民主主义国家的各种建设工作，努力生产劳动，反对游手好闲、歧视妇女、封建迷信以及其他一切腐化堕落行为。”“（四）爱护人民与国家财富，自觉地遵守各种革命秩序与纪律，与一切损害人民及国家财产及破坏公共秩序的行为作斗争。”等，这是反映了新的革命形势的需要。因为人民民主革命即将取得全国胜利，为了建设新中国，积极参加新民主主义国家的各种建设工作与爱护人民与国家财富的任务，日益迫切地提到了中国人民和中国青年的面前。
    二、中国新民主主义青年团底性质
    中共中央在今年元旦所公布的建团决议中，在任弼时同志向我们这次代表大会所作的政治报告中，对于中国新民主主义青年团的性质，都已有了明确的说明。中国新民主主义青年团是中国共产党领导的，以无产阶级的思想体系为指导思想的，以青年工人、青年农民、青年革命知识分子为基础的，广泛团结各阶层先进青年的，为新民主主义的彻底实现而奋斗的，先进青年的群众性组织。
    需要分别说明以下的问题：
    （１）关于中国共产党领导的问题。——为什么中国新民主主义青年团必须中国共产党的领导？是不是可以不要共产党的领导呢？
    答复：一百年来特别是三十年来中国的革命历史证明：离开中国共产党的领导，中国的革命运动就难以成功，中国人民和中国青年的真正解放也就没有可能。三十年来，中国青年从北洋军阀及国民党反动派那里所得到的，是说不尽的卖国、独裁及屠杀青年的血腥罪行，只有中国共产党是始终一贯地热烈同情和支持青年的爱国运动，并且给青年指出了正确的斗争方向，引导他们走向胜利，走向光明。中国革命的伟大胜利和中国青年的远大前途，都是和中国共产党的正确领导分不开的。因此，中国青年愿意无保留地完全信任中国共产党的领导，也就成为逻辑上的必然结论了。
    青年团公开声明接受中国共产党的领导，会不会使青年群众发生疑虑，以致削弱青年团的群众性呢？
    答复：在过去国民党反动统治的地区，共产党领导的群众运动还不得不处于地下状态的时候，那时有一些政治上比较落后的群众，对于共产党的革命性质缺少了解，对于共产党所领导的革命运动的必胜前途缺少信心，曾经有过惧怕和共产党接近的心理，但这种情况早就有了根本变化。现在中国共产党是中国政治生活中起决定作用的领导政党，中国共产党对于中国人民解放事业的忠心和伟大贡献，已得到全国人民和全国青年的公认和拥护，现在已不是青年群众惧怕或不愿和共产党接近的问题，而是广大青年热烈地盼待着共产党的领导和教育。在这种情况下，青年团也就决不会因为受了共产党的领导而削弱自己的群众基础，相反只能使自己的工作做得更好，因而更加得到广大群众的拥护，并使青年团的广大发展获得保证。青年团的实际发展情形，已经给我们完全证实了这一点。
    （２）以无产阶级的思想体系作为指导思想的问题——为了使青年运动保持完全正确的发展方向，青年团除了在政治上拥护新民主主义纲领与共产党的各种具体政策决议外，同时还须根据无产阶级马列主义的观点处理一切问题，系统地进行辩证唯物论与历史唯物论的思想教育，帮助青年团员建立革命的世界观、人生观和正确的思想方法，使他们具有革命的爱国主义和国际主义精神，具有严肃的工作态度和生活态度，能够锻炼成为思想和体魄都很健全的革命战士。唯有这样，青年团也才能真正名副其实的成为以马列主义精神教育青年的学校。
    （３）关于以青年工人、青年农民、青年革命知识分子为基础的问题——青年团的组织，以青年工人、青年农民、青年革命知识分子为基础，这说明了青年团的社会基础不是狭隘而是广泛的。有一种意见，认为青年团是无产阶级的群众组织，这种了解不完全恰当，因为青年团的主要组织成份，不但有属于无产阶级的工人，而且还有不属于无产阶级的青年农民和青年革命知识分子，此外还包括其他社会阶层的民主青年，这和无产阶级性的群众组织如象职工会是显然有区别的。不错，青年团是共产党所领导，并以无产阶级思想体系为指导思想，但这只是要把提高全体青年团员到达无产阶级马列主义的思想水平，当做青年团所希望达到的奋斗目标，并不是任何阶层或各种不同政治水平的青年一经入团就都已变成了无产阶级或具有了作为共产党员那样高度的无产阶级思想水平。
    还有一种意见，认为青年工人可组织在工会内、青年农民可组织在农会内，青年团只需以青年学生为主要对象，不必在工农青年中去进行工作建立组织，这种了解也不恰当。青年团是共产党和人民民主政府建设新民主主义中国伟大事业中的各方面助手，它显然不能将自己的工作阵地和组织基础，仅仅局限于知识青年的狭小圈子内。同时青年团又是集合工、农、知识分子青年群众中的先进分子所组成，他们在各种工作当中，积极响应共产党和人民政府的各种号召，发挥青年所特有的先锋作用、带头作用，成为一支突击力量，青年团的这种突击队作用，也显然不是带有全体性的工农群众组织如工会农会所能完全代替的。所以青年团应以很大的注意在工农劳动青年中去进行工作，发展组织。特别是跟着革命形势的发展，共产党的工作重心已从农村转到城市的今天，加强青年团在青年工人群众中的工作，更有着特别迫切重要的意义。
    另外，对于革命知识分子的范围如何规定，他们是否可以成为青年团的基础，大家的了解还不一致，我们需要特别研究一下这个问题：
    什么是“革命知识分子”？凡是真正拥护革命，并有实际行动表现的知识分子，都得称为革命知识分子。在解放以前即已实际参加革命运动，而现在还继续革命工作者，自然是革命知识分子；就在解放以前没有参加革命工作，而在解放以后因为受到了革命的影响或教育以后才开始拥护共产党，拥护新民主主义纲领，并确有事实表现，如在共产党及人民民主政府的领导下积极工作，或在实行新民主主义教育方针的学校中努力学习，能在将来为革命的建设事业服务者，亦得列为革命知识分子。
    我们现在对“革命知识分子”的这种解释，是要比过去一般了解的标准显得更为广泛，原因是现在革命已在全国范围内获得决定性的胜利，共产党已成为中国政治生活中的领导政党，中国共产党在中国人民中间，已经树立了最高的威信和最普遍深入的影响，这种新的形势，已使中国知识分子的社会地位在无形之中起了根本变化。在国民党反动派所统治的旧中国，知识分子走向为人民服务的道路是堵塞着的，整个社会都在驱使他们离开人民的立场，依附于反动阶级，所以只有坚持英勇革命斗争的较小一部分知识分子，可以取得“革命知识分子”的称号。但在共产党所领导的人民民主政权下，就完全是另外一种情况，这里知识青年走向为人民服务的革命道路已经畅通无阻，除了极少数死心塌地的顽固反动分子之外，绝大多数知识分子，都将能在共产党和人民民主政府的领导和鼓舞之下，积极参加各种革命工作，成为革命知识分子，当中国的知识分子在客观上已可能更广泛更普遍地参加革命时，我们就应该开诚欢迎，使他们能和其他革命人民，主要是工人、农民携手前进，在革命运动中发挥更大作用，我们现在对于革命知识分子做如此广泛的解释，正是反映了这种新的形势和新的需要。否则不但对于大批愿意和可能参加革命的知识青年的要求不能满足，而且对于革命事业也将是一个重大损失。
    自然，革命知识分子的范围比过去宽广，并不等于降低甚至放弃了革命知识分子所应当具备的必要条件，认为所有解放区学校的学生及其他知识分子，包括新解放地区学校的学生及其他知识分子在内，不问其实际政治态度如何，全部都无条件地成了革命知识分子。现在和过去一样，对于革命知识分子的要求，都是要真心拥护人民的革命事业，并愿为其实现而努力奋斗。只是由于现在革命的主观力量及政治影响更强大，使知识分子能够更广泛更普遍的接受革命洗礼，因而使革命知识分子的范围也就自然地远较过去为扩大而已。而且将来革命形势继续向前发展，革命知识分子的范围还要继续随之扩大，直到全体知识分子都在共产党的系统领导和教育下，无例外地都拥护革命，为革命事业奋斗，成为革命知识分子。到这种时候，所谓革命知识分子的名词，就会没有再存在的必要了。因为全部知识分子都革命，就不必再特别标出“革命”的字样，如象现在的苏联就是一个例子。
    自然，团章规定革命知识分子为青年团的基础之一，并不等于就把革命知识分子全部都无条件地吸收入团，正象青年团虽以青年的工人、农民为基础，并不等于就要把全体青年的工人、农民都无条件地吸收入团。仅仅是说：除了青年的工人、农民以外，青年团同时还应以革命知识分子为主要的发展对象。至于从他们中间吸收团员时，当然无例外地都须根据他们每人的自觉自愿，并履行团章所规定的入团手续以后，方能入团。
    （４）关于广泛团结各阶层先进青年问题——青年团一方面是具有很广泛的群众性，除了大量吸收工农劳动青年和青年革命知识分子以外，对于共产党以外的中国其他民主党派及无党派的各界先进青年，只要他愿为新民主主义的实现而奋斗，赞同青年团的工作纲领和组织章程，并愿遵守青年团的纪律和执行青年团的决议，同样亦得申请入团。但另一方面青年团同时又具有革命性和进步性，凡是反动的和落后的青年，则将不能加入中国新民主主义青年团的队伍。凡是属于反动党派社团的青年如欲参加青年团，则须经过比较慎重的考察，确实证明他和反动党派已无思想上和组织上的联系，并经过团章所规定的程序手续，始可批准入团。
    （５）新民主主义青年团和过去共产主义青年团的区别——中国新民主主义青年团和过去中国共产主义青年团的区别有两方面，一是纲领上的区别，共产主义青年团以承认共产主义纲领为入团先决条件，新民主主义青年团以承认新民主主义纲领为入团先决条件。二是组织基础的区别，共产主义青年团在原则上以工农劳动青年为主体，新民主主义青年团以工农青年和青年革命知识分子为基础，同时还要广泛团结各阶层的先进青年，包括赞成新民主主义共同纲领的各民主党派的青年在内。从这两方面看，我们就可知道新民主主义青年团比起过去的共产主义青年团来，是更为广泛，这是完全符合于中国新民主主义时期的客观环境和实际需要的。
    但新民主主义青年团仅仅是在政治纲领及社会基础底广泛性这一点上和过去共产主义青年团有区别，至于这两个团体的基本性质和主要任务——作为共产党领导下的团结青年的核心组织及以马列主义、毛泽东思想教育青年的革命学校，那是完全一致的。
    三、青年团的基本组织原则——民主集中制
    新民主主义青年团的组织原则，是民主集中制。
    青年团的团章，一方面充分反映了团内的民主精神，一方面又反映了组织上的高度集中性。
    青年团的民主精神，表现在以下各方面：
    （１）各级领导机关，皆经选举产生。青年团的正式团员，每人均有选举权被选举权，每人都是青年团的主人翁之一。
    （２）各级团的领导机关，均实行委员会制与集体领导制。各种重大问题的决定，须经过民主方式，取决于多数的意见。任何人不能独断专行。
    （３）团员在团的会议上，可以自由发表意见，讨论各种问题。提出任何建议，批评任何工作人员，以及越级向上申诉自己的意见（当然，如发言或批评错误，别人也有声辩和纠正的权利）。
    （４）定期召开团员大会及团的各级代表大会，审查并确定各级团的工作。各级领导机关，均须向团员大会及各级代表大会负责，执行其决议，接受其监督。
    （５）承认团外青年群众和一般人民群众对于本团的工作和组织有批评建议之权，可以邀请他们列席团的支部大会或各级代表大会。这样就使青年团能够更广泛地听取群众的意见，集思广益，充分发扬民主精神。
    青年团组织上的集中性，表现在以下的方面：
    （１）必须愿为新民主主义的革命事业积极奋斗，愿为劳动人民忠诚服务，承认团章，服从决议，参加本团工作者，始得申请入团。思想反动者不能入团；不经过团章所规定的入团手续不能入团；无正当理由四个月不参加团的工作者不能继续保持团籍；如有严重违犯团章团纪的错误行为，则将受到处分，从劝告直到开除。
    （２）青年团员必须严格遵守团内秩序：少数服从多数，下级服从上级，个人服从组织。对于本团一切问题的决定，在讨论时尽有分歧意见，但多数通过或上级批准后，即须无条件执行。允许保留意见，但不得坚持自己的意见而单独行动；以便保证青年团在组织上和行动上的统一，使能在任何环境下战斗前进。
    民主和集中在形式上看来是对立的，但在实质上是互相结合和统一的。在青年团的组织生活中，一方面我们必须充分地发扬民主，保证每一个团员的民主权利，反对一切不尊重他人意志的独断专行的不民主作风；另一方面又必须有集中，要少数服从多数，下级服从上级，个人服从组织。民主和集中这二者互相结合，同时服从并服务于一个共同一致的目标——保证最大多数人的最大利益。因此，民主集中制是反映了最大多数人底最大利益的组织原则，惟有真正代表多数人利益的革命组织，才能真正运用民主集中制。青年团的内部生活，必须正确体现民主集中制的精神，将高度的民主生活和高度的组织性互相结合起来。这是青年团充沛的生命力底源泉。
    四、青年团在组织上的独立性
    中共中央关于建立中国新民主主义青年团的决议中指出：“中国新民主主义青年团在政治上接受中国共产党的领导，但在组织上应当保持自己的独立系统”。
    任弼时同志在这次代表大会的政治报告中指出：“对于青年组织应有的独立性与‘闹独立性’的偏向（青年主义偏向）也应加以清楚的区别。‘闹独立性’的偏向应加以反对，但同时应当注意尊重青年组织在组织上应有的独立性。”如何了解青年团在组织上的独立性，这是大家所关心的问题。现在我们需要指出以下三点：第一，在执行中国共产党的总方针和总任务的前提下，青年团需要有自己独立的工作和活动。第二，青年团本身是一个独立的组织，因此，在自己组织系统内，青年团应有适当调整和调动自己干部的权力。第三，青年团应有自己一定的经费预算，以便于主动地有计划地进行工作。
    上述三点自然并没有完备无遗地概括了青年团在组织上的“独立性”的全部内容，只是由于这几个问题时常在实际工作当中引起误解和争论，所以特别加以说明。
    青年团在活动上，干部调动上，经费预算上保有自己必要的独立性，绝不是要在工作上离开党的领导，或者和党所规定的总任务相矛盾，仅仅是为了充分发挥青年的积极性、创造性，以便更好地配合党底总任务的完成。
    建立青年团的工作刚在开始，我们的经验还很有限，不但有许多问题没有解决，甚至还有许多问题没有被提出，这只能在以后更深入的工作当中去发现和研究解决了。
