    Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, 20th -- To support the production of the Kailuan Mining Bureau, the North China People's Government granted the mine special permission in early May to transport coal to Shanghai to exchange for flour, pit props, etc. The Ministry of Industry and Commerce has now granted the mine special permission to ship 60,000 tons of coal to Hong Kong per month for a period of six months, and has reduced its export tax to 5% ad valorem (originally stipulated at 30% ad valorem, later reduced to 15%). If the mine has legitimate uses for the foreign exchange earned from this coal export, such as paying freight or purchasing machinery and equipment, it has priority in applying to use it.
    Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, 20th -- In order to supply the fuel needed by Shanghai, Nanjing, Hankou, Qingdao and other places, and to guarantee the restoration and development of industrial production in these places, the Pingjin Coal and Iron Company has decided to establish a branch company in Qinhuangdao to manage the coal from the Great Wall and Kailuan mines, and to vigorously organize shipping to facilitate the southward transport of coal. The company will begin operations within days. It is reported that after the liberation of Qingdao and Hankou, they have successively ordered 28,000 tons of Kailuan coal from the Pingjin Coal and Iron Company, and 4,000 tons have already been shipped to Qingdao.
