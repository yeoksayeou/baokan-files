Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, June 6th: The Zhengzhou Trade Union has had serious closed-door tendencies in its work in the past, which has greatly affected the development of the trade union organization. Since the establishment of the Zhengzhou Municipal Trade Union, the city has only developed 1,022 formal members, accounting for 10% of the city's total number of employees. There are six enterprises in which trade unions have been established, accounting for only 29% of the city's 21 enterprises. The main reasons for the closed-door tendency are that the cadres of the trade union have not studied and researched various documents related to the labor movement and urban work, so they do not have a clear understanding of the nature and tasks of the trade union. At the same time, the cadres have a strong rural perspective. After entering the city, they believe that the history of ordinary workers is complex without analysis, suspect that many workers have political problems, and dare not trust the workers. At the same time, they hope to establish a good foundation for the trade union all at once without steps and without a certain goal. The above-mentioned tendencies have aroused the serious attention of the leading organs of the Municipal Trade Union and are beginning to be corrected.

　　郑州职工会纠正关门主义倾向
    【新华社郑州六日电】郑州市的职工会工作中过去存在着严重的关门主义倾向，影响工会组织的发展甚大。郑州市自市职工会成立以来，全市只发展了一千零二十二个正式会员，占全市职工人数的百分之十；各企业中已成立职工会的有六个，只占全市二十一个企业单位的百分之二十九。产生关门主义偏向的主要原因是职工会的干部没有很好地学习与研究有关工运与城市工作的各种文件，因而对工会的性质与任务认识不清，同时干部存在着浓厚的农村观点，进城后不加分析地认为一般工人的历史复杂，怀疑许多工人有政治问题，不敢相信工人，同时不分步骤地，没有一定目标地希望一下就把工会的基础建立好。上述偏向已引起市职工会领导机关的严重注意，正开始纠正。
