Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 12th: According to TASS, Paris: On June 10th, the foreign ministers of the Soviet Union, the United States, Britain, and France held their fifth meeting of the third week, chaired by French Foreign Minister Schuman.

　　At the beginning of the meeting, the delegations of the Western countries repeatedly evaded considering the issue of a single currency for Berlin, although they had not put forward any suggestions on this issue. The refusal of the Western countries' representatives to consider the issue of a single currency for Berlin shows that they are willing to maintain and deepen the division of Germany and its capital, Berlin.

　　The representatives of the United States, Britain, and France also did not express a sincere desire to consider the third item on the agenda, thus also demonstrating their unwillingness to conclude a peace treaty with Germany. Bevin's position was such that he used many sophistries to oppose discussing the treaty issue at the current foreign ministers' conference.

　　Vyshinsky then spoke, saying that when the Council of Foreign Ministers was established in Potsdam, it was emphasized that its special task was to prepare for peace treaties. The Potsdam Agreement explicitly stated: The Council of Foreign Ministers will be used to prepare for a peace treaty with Germany. However, for a long time, the delegations of the United States, Britain, and France have systematically evaded fulfilling this obligation. Vyshinsky pointed out that the issue of concluding a peace treaty with Germany is one of the major international issues. It is a fundamental issue for Germany because it must decide Germany's long-term fate. Concluding a peace treaty with Germany is the path for Germany and all peace-loving countries in Europe to eliminate the consequences of the war. It is the path to Germany's economic and political revival, and the path for Germany to develop into a unified, peace-loving, and democratic country. Therefore, not only the German people are concerned about concluding a peace treaty as soon as possible, but also all people of all countries who strive to establish and consolidate peace based on the democratic principles stipulated in Yalta and Potsdam in 1945 express the same concern.

　　　　Concluding a peace treaty with Germany will further develop the democratic forces in Germany.

　　Vyshinsky continued that Germany occupies an important position in the international economic system. Therefore, Germany cannot be excluded from international exchanges and from the family of democratic nations. In the four years since the Hitler war machine was destroyed and the Hitler state was eliminated, Germany has made significant achievements in democratic reconstruction. Concluding a peace treaty with Germany will ensure further progress in this regard, as it will create favorable conditions for the further development and strengthening of democratic forces throughout Germany, consolidate democratic principles in German administrative institutions and public life, and enhance the German people's will to establish international cooperation with all democratic countries around the world. In this way, the treaty will facilitate Germany's further achievements in the development of the German nation and the consolidation of all its progressive forces to solve the task of democratic and peaceful cooperation with other countries. All of this obliges the Council of Foreign Ministers to conclude a peace treaty with Germany as soon as possible.

　　Vyshinsky also said that as early as the Fifth Session of the Council of Foreign Ministers held in London in 1947, the Soviet government suggested that the drafting of a peace treaty with Germany should be started without delay. However, this proposal of the Soviet Union was not supported by other foreign ministers, who evaded discussing this issue. Not only that, but they also signed the so-called Occupation Statute in Washington this year, attempting to use it to replace the peace treaty with Germany and indefinitely extend the occupation system.

　　Afterwards, Vyshinsky, on behalf of the Soviet government, put forward the following proposal on the issue of preparing a peace treaty with Germany: The governments of the United States, Britain, France, and the Soviet Union should submit a draft peace treaty with Germany to the Council of Foreign Ministers within three months. This draft peace treaty with Germany will stipulate that the occupying forces of all countries will withdraw within one year after the conclusion of the treaty. Vyshinsky also suggested that the Council of Foreign Ministers should make a decision that the work of studying the procedures for preparing the treaty should be completed at this session of the Council of Foreign Ministers.

　　The Soviet delegation's precise and clear proposal put the representatives of the Western countries in a difficult position. They seemed to be shelving the preparation of a peace treaty with Germany by making various excuses. However, openly declaring opposition to this proposal would be the final exposure that they are enemies of preparing a peace treaty with Germany as soon as possible. Therefore, the representatives of the Western countries hurriedly began to gather arguments, trying to use these arguments to postpone the discussion of the Soviet proposal to "the 30th of the Greek calendar," which everyone knows does not exist.

　　The discussion on the issue of preparing a peace treaty with Germany at the meeting of foreign ministers on the 10th was fruitless, and the next meeting was scheduled for the 12th.

　　苏外长驳斥美英法分裂阴谋
  　建议早日缔结对德和约           
    要在三个月内由四国提出和约草案
    【新华社北平十二日电】据塔斯社巴黎讯：六月十日，苏美英法四国外长举行第三周的第五次会议，由法外长舒曼任主席。
    会议一开始，西方国家的代表团就再三回避考虑柏林使用单一货币的问题，虽然他们对这一问题还没有提出任何建议。西方国家的代表们拒绝考虑柏林使用单一货币的问题，这表明他们愿意保持并加深德国和它的首都柏林的分裂。
    美英法的代表们也没有表示认真考虑议程第三项的愿望。因而，也表明他们不愿意缔结德国和约。贝文的立场就是如此，他用许多诡辩来反对在目前外长会议上讨论和约问题。
    维辛斯基接着发言，他说，当在波茨坦确定设立外长会议的时候，曾强调指出它的特别任务是准备缔和的工作。波茨坦协定明确的说：外长会议将被用来进行对德和约的准备工作。但是，好久以来，美英法三国代表团却在有系统地规避履行这一义务。维辛斯基指出，缔结对德和约问题，是国际上的重大问题之一。它对德国来说是个基本问题，因为它必须决定德国长远时期中的命运。缔结对德和约，不仅是德国而且也是欧洲一切爱好和平国家清除战争后果的大道。这是德国经济与政治复兴的道路，是德国发展为统一的，爱好和平的民主国家的道路。因此，不仅德国人民关心尽早缔结和约，而且一切力求以一九四五年雅尔塔与波茨坦所规定的民主原则为基础而建立与巩固和平的各国人民，也表示同样的关心。
    　　　　缔结对德和约，将进一步发展德国民主力量。
    维辛斯基继称，德国在国际经济体系中占有重要的地位。因此，不能使德国置身于国际交往之外，置身于民主国家大家庭之外。自从希特勒战争机器被捣毁，希特勒国家被消灭以来的四年当中，德国在民主重建上已取得了重大的成就。缔结对德和约将确保这一方面的进一步进展，因为这将创造有利的条件，以利于进一步发展与加强整个德国的民主力量，巩固德国行政机构与公众生活中的民主原则，和增强德国人民与全世界一切民主国家建立国际合作的意志。这样，在德国民族的发展以及巩固其一切进步力量以解决与其他国家实行民主及和平合作的任务中，和约将便利德国取得进一步的成就。所有这些，都使外长会议负有义务尽早缔结对德和约。
    维辛斯基又称，早在一九四七年于伦敦举行第五届外长会议上，苏联政府就建议毫不延缓地开始起草对德和约。但是，苏联的这一建议未获其他外长的支持，他们规避讨论这一问题。不仅如此，他们并于今年在华盛顿签订了所谓占领法规，企图用它来代替对德和约，并无限期地延长占领制度。
    其后，维辛斯基代表苏联政府关于准备对德和约问题提出下列建议：美、英、法、苏四国政府，在三个月内向外长会议提出对德和约草案，在这个对德和约草案中，并将规定一切国家的占领军在和约缔结一年之内撤退。维辛斯基同时建议，外长会议应作决定，研究准备和约程序的工作，应在本届外长会议上完成。
    苏联代表团的精密而明确的建议，使西方国家的代表处于困难地位。他们似乎在用各种借口把对德和约的准备工作束之高阁。但是，公开声言反对这一建议，对他们说来就是最后暴露自己是尽早准备对德和约的敌人。因引，西方国家的代表，匆忙地开始来收集论据，想借这些论据把对苏联建议的讨论推延到“希腊日历上的三十号”，大家都知道，这一天是从不存在的。
    十日的外长会议关于准备对德和约问题的讨论无结果，下次会议定于十二日召开。
