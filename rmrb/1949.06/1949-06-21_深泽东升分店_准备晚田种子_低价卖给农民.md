[Hebei Central Electric] The Shenze State-owned Dongsheng Branch Store has prepared 40,000 jin of late-season seeds to supply to farmers at low prices. The second, third, fourth, and sixth districts of Shenze suffered relatively severe flooding last year, and a large area of wheat fields was sown. The harvest this year is not good, and there is an urgent need to sow late seedlings. However, due to the poor autumn harvest last year, late-season seeds are extremely difficult to obtain. To this end, the Shenze State-owned Dongsheng Branch Store and the County Promotion Cooperative have purchased 40,000 jin of late corn seeds and 1,000 jin of soybean seeds. In order to sell the seeds to farmers in a timely manner, the Dongsheng Branch Store, in addition to retaining a very small amount of corn to stabilize seed prices in the market, has completely handed over the remaining seeds to the Promotion Cooperative for distribution. This allows disaster-stricken branches and district cadres to purchase from the county cooperative or exchange for wheat according to the needs of farmers, and sell them at prices slightly lower than the market price.

    准备晚田种子  低价卖给农民
    【冀中电】深泽国营东升分店准备晚田种子四万斤，低价供给农民。深泽二、三、四、六区，去年水灾较为严重，麦田播种面积很广，今年收成不好，急须播种晚苗，但因去秋歉收，晚田种子极感困难。为此，深泽国营东升分店和县推进社，已购买晚玉米种四万斤，吉豆种一千斤。为将种子及时卖到农民手中，东升分店除留下极少数玉米，准备在市场稳定种子价格外，其余种子完全交给推进社掌握分配。让灾区分社和区干部，根据农民需要统一到县社购买或用小麦交换。并以稍低于市价的价格出售。
