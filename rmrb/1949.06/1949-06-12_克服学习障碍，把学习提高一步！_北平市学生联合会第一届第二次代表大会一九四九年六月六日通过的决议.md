(I) In the three months since the closing of the first representative conference of this association, the World Peace Congress has been held, and the peace and democracy forces of the people of the world, led by the Soviet Union, have become stronger. In China, Nanjing, Shanghai, and the vast areas of southern Jiangsu have been liberated. The reactionary rule of the Kuomintang has been declared dead, and the task of building a new democratic country has been more urgently brought before us. The people of all walks of life in Beiping are organizing to restore and develop production, and to strive for the construction of a new Beiping. Many schools are also gradually improving in accordance with the new democratic education policy. The students of Beiping, in the democratic and free life after liberation, in the encouragement and training of the revolutionary upsurge, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and the People's Government, have also greatly improved their thinking. The central task of the Beiping student movement after liberation, as determined by the first representative conference of this association, is to study hard, establish a world outlook of serving the people, learn new democratic ideology, and learn the knowledge and skills to build the country. The facts of the past three months have proved that this is completely correct. Tens of thousands of students in the city have applied to revolutionary cadre schools and participated in the southward work group and other revolutionary work. The students in schools have gradually established or are establishing new learning viewpoints and attitudes, and have shown great gains and achievements in thinking in extracurricular activities such as the army support movement and the cleaning movement, especially in the movements to examine the people's scholarships in universities and the temporary relief funds in middle schools. The students in most schools have also established a new and conscious learning order on the new democratic and free foundation, but there are also some shortcomings and problems in the path of advancement of the learning life of the vast number of students in Beiping. If these shortcomings and problems are not resolved in time, they will hinder our normal learning. The most important of these problems is that in some schools, after we overthrew the Kuomintang rule and broke the old "order" that bound students' freedom and creativity, there was a phenomenon of disorganization and disorder in the establishment of a new democratic and conscious learning order; secondly, there are the recognition and attitude towards the reform of the academic system and curriculum in universities, and how extracurricular activities should be carried out in universities and middle schools. The students in Beiping have made great efforts in studying and solving these problems, and have obtained many good results and experiences, but in order to solve these problems more perfectly, further efforts must be made.

(II) Some schools have had, to varying degrees, a phenomenon of disorganization and disorder for a period of time. In middle schools where the phenomenon of disorganization and disorder is serious, classroom order is chaotic, some students do not attend classes that they should attend, or do not listen carefully in class, do not take exams, and do not pay tuition fees. A few hooligan students gather to fight and threaten classmates. The reasons for these phenomena are: on the part of teachers and staff, most are due to the fact that the persons in charge and teachers of some private schools do not understand the education policy of the People's Government, and therefore let things go. But some are at a loss after breaking their old set of implementing autocracy on students, or even deliberately watch coldly. As for the students, some are simply dissatisfied with the unreformed old curriculum and old management methods, some have extremely democratic ideas, and some are constantly participating in various extracurricular activities, or seeing many students participating in revolutionary schools, which also causes them to feel uneasy. In addition, there are some schools where the administration is manipulated by a very small number of reactionaries, intentionally condoning or even instigating reactionary elements and a small number of hooligan students to make trouble. This phenomenon has now been greatly corrected through the leadership and call of the government, relying on the joint efforts of the vast number of teachers and students. Only a very small number of private middle schools have made little improvement and must continue to be overcome. We call on students to unite and unite all teachers who are willing to serve the people and love the school to jointly strive to transform a few bad elements and launch a struggle against factors that disrupt or affect learning order. We believe that under the leadership of the People's Government, the phenomenon of disorganization and disorder in a small number of schools will be quickly corrected by the force of the masses.

We believe that a normal learning order must be established, but this order should be established on the basis of promoting the democratic spirit and consciousness of the vast number of students. It is not a revival of the feudal and reactionary old order. On the contrary, everything fascist and feudal, that is, the Kuomintang's rule of students, suppressing and binding students' freedom and creativity, must be thoroughly eliminated, and all unreasonable parts of the old school rules and regulations must also be quickly abolished.

Schools that have achieved success in correcting the phenomenon of disorganization and disorder are mostly those where the teachers and school leaders have taken leadership responsibilities and adopted correct policies and methods, combined with the conscious efforts of the students, that is, the teachers have implemented the education policies of the People's Government, taken responsibility, the student union has called, the communist party members, youth league members and progressive students have taken the lead in opening up the students' minds, and have used persuasion and learning competitions to mobilize the vast number of students to create model classes, and have carried out criticism and self-criticism of the phenomenon of disorganization and disorder. Necessary and appropriate struggles and efforts have also been made to transform a small number of hooligan students. All those who have carried out more in-depth ideological education and promoted democratic and conscious spirit have achieved more significant results. However, there are also a small number of schools that, although they have also achieved results, have a bias in the method of rectifying school order by simply paying attention to appearance and simply using administrative orders to establish order. They have not mobilized students well from the ideological level, so that students recognize why a learning order should be established and how to establish this order, nor have they closely linked the establishment of order with learning revolutionary ideas and learning course work well. Students in schools where ideological mobilization is not sufficient, in addition to consolidating the learning order that has been initially established, must further strengthen ideological education and ideological leadership, enlighten students' democratic spirit and consciousness, establish correct learning viewpoints and learning attitudes, and do a good job in learning.

For all the students in the schools, we believe that we should continue to further strengthen our political study, improve the political level of the students, establish a solid revolutionary outlook on life, strengthen the study of cultural knowledge and scientific skills useful to the people's democratic cause, and step up the cultivation of ourselves to become good servants of the people.

In the general courses of middle schools, vocational schools and specialized schools, the parts that spread reactionary and harmful ideas must be deleted from the current Chinese language courses; the old history courses are permeated with historical viewpoints that defend reactionary rule and idealism, and textbooks must be replaced as soon as possible. It is completely justified for students to express dissatisfaction with these courses that should be changed but have not yet been reformed and to demand that they be reformed as soon as possible. It is wrong to ignore these opinions of the students. However, students should adopt a positive attitude of transformation towards the reform of these courses and certain teaching methods and the undemocratic phenomena of the school authorities, and should actively provide opinions to help and promote school improvement, and should not treat them in a passive way such as dropping courses. Political classes are helpful to help students learn revolutionary theory and establish a solid outlook on life, and should be actively studied. It is wrong to ignore political classes. (When individual private schools employ unqualified political teachers and the content of political classes is inappropriate, students should start discussions and criticisms to help improve them.)

(III) In universities and independent colleges, the old academic system and curriculum have not been reformed as necessary according to the new democratic education policy, which has a great impact on the learning mood of students (especially those in liberal arts). The reform of the law department of Peking University proves that launching a learning movement and reforming the academic system in universities, especially in liberal arts colleges, is directly related. Before and after the reform of the law department of Peking University, the students' learning mood changed from negative and bored to unprecedented positive enthusiasm, which is the best explanation. In the process of reforming the law department of Peking University, the students' thinking was enlightened, the professors and teaching assistants were united, and individual teachers who disagreed with the reform were persuaded and united to move forward together. These are all good experiences. Since the entire process of reforming the academic system is also a process of implementing the new democratic education policy and a process of struggle to transform cultural and educational thought, this work must basically be established on the common understanding and consciousness of the vast number of students and teachers, and widely absorb everyone's common research and promotion. The reform of the academic system must be carried out cautiously, step by step, and with preparation. It is wrong to wait passively. Students should take an active attitude to help promote this reform, provide the results of discussion and research to the government for reference, and strive for more improvements after the summer vacation. But at the same time, it can also be suggested to the school to increase some new courses, abolish some old courses or change them to elective courses as soon as possible and as much as possible. In the engineering college, appropriate reforms should also be made to the phenomenon of separation between theory and practice and to the phenomenon that hinders students' health and learning efficiency. In this way, in the process of discussing the academic system and curriculum, students' understanding of reforming the academic system can be improved, the learning mood can be stabilized, and the early realization of the new democratic education policy can be actually promoted.

(IV) Appropriate extracurricular activities and social service activities have played a great role in helping the students of Beiping to promote the people's revolutionary movement and to help students improve their own thinking and establish a revolutionary outlook on life. Therefore, necessary extracurricular activities should be better organized and carried out. However, in a period of time, many schools had too much unnecessary extracurricular activities, and the students working in the student union had an especially heavy burden. This excessive amount of unnecessary social activities due to unplanned leadership (such as arranging too many meetings, participating in too many off-campus activities, delaying the progress of courses, and recreational activities), affected the learning life, reduced academic performance, and caused activists to be separated from the vast number of students. Another main reason for this phenomenon is that the content of extracurricular activities was not combined with learning the main courses well (the failure to reform the main courses according to the new democratic education policy is also one of the reasons why extracurricular activities failed to cooperate with the main courses). At present, these phenomena have been greatly improved. The vast number of students have realized that the attitude of not caring about national affairs, not participating in political activities, and reading behind closed doors is wrong, but unnecessary extracurricular activities should be abolished. Even necessary extracurricular activities should strive not to hinder the learning of main courses. In addition, the students working in the student union should distribute the work to everyone as much as possible, reduce unnecessary meetings, not hold unprepared meetings, learn the course work well, and go deep into the masses in the leadership of learning to become the core of uniting students.

Collective learning and learning assistance are a method to promote learning and increase learning efficiency, and can be appropriately advocated and promoted. However, it should be carried out with leadership and preparation, and should be based on strengthening self-study. The tendency to rely on study group meetings without leadership and preparation should be prevented and corrected. The method of collective discussion should reduce its proportion and time in natural science courses more than in social science courses.

(V) Students! The students of Beiping, who have a glorious revolutionary tradition, should also play a glorious role in the great cause of building a new democratic country in the future. Chairman Mao said: "The complete victory of the Liberation War is only the first step in the Long March." The construction work in the future will be more difficult and arduous than the past struggles. To this end, students must work harder, establish a revolutionary outlook on life and world outlook under the banner of Mao Zedong, learn new democratic ideology and theory, and further attack the fortress of science and technology and master various knowledge weapons. Strive to cultivate yourself into useful talents for building the country. Therefore, the obstacles that currently exist on the road of learning progress must be overcome gradually with all efforts, and preparations must be completed in order to enter normal learning.

　　克服学习障碍，把学习提高一步！
    北平市学生联合会第一届第二次代表大会一九四九年六月六日通过的决议
    （一）自从本会第一次代表大会闭幕到现在的三个月期间，全世界拥护和平大会召开了，以苏联为首的全世界人民和平民主力量表现得更强大了。在中国，南京上海及广大江南地区解放了。国民党反动统治已经宣告灭亡，建设新民主主义国家的任务更迫切地提到我们面前了。北平市的各界人民，正在组织起来为恢复与发展生产，为新北平的建设而努力，许多学校也在依照新民主主义的教育方针在逐步改进着。我北平的同学，解放后在民主自由的生活中，在革命高潮的鼓舞和锻炼中，在中国共产党和人民政府的领导之下，在思想上也已大大的提高了一步。本会第一次代表大会所决定的解放后北平学生运动的中心任务是努力学习，确立为人民服务的人生观，学习新民主主义思想，学习建设国家的知识技能。三个月来的事实证明是完全正确的，全市有成万的同学投考了革命干部学校，参加了南下工作团及其他革命工作，在校的同学们则已逐步建立了或在建立着新的学习观点和态度，并且在劳军运动、清洁运动等课外活动中，特别是在审核大学人民助学金和中学临时救济金等运动中，表现了在思想上有很大的收获和成就。多数学校的同学，并已在新的民主自由的基础上，建立了新的、自觉的学习秩序，但是北平广大同学学习生活的前进道路上，也存在着若干缺点和问题，这些缺点和问题，如不及时解决就会妨碍我们正常的学习。这些问题中最主要的是有些学校在我们打倒了国民党统治，打破了旧的束缚学生自由与创造性的旧“秩序”之后，在建立新的民主的自觉的学习秩序中，曾经发生了散漫无秩序的现象；其次是大学里的对待学制课程改革的认识和态度及大中学校中的课外活动应该如何进行等。北平同学在研究与解决这些问题上，曾展开了很大的努力，并获得了许多良好的成果与经验，但为了更完善地解决这些问题，还须作更进一步的努力。
    （二）有些学校曾有一个时期或多或少存在着散漫无秩序的现象，在散漫无秩序现象严重的中学中，课堂秩序紊乱，有些学生对应上的课不上，或上课不好好听，不考试，应缴学费也不缴，少数流氓学生聚众打架、威吓同学等。这些现象产生的原因：在教职员方面大都是由于有些私立学校的负责人及教师不了解人民政府教育方针，因而放任不管，但也有的是在打破了他们旧日对学生实行专制的一套之后，一时莫知所措，甚至故意冷眼旁观。至于在同学方面，有的是由于对未经改革的旧课程旧管理方法根本不满，有的是由于有极端民主化的思想，也有的是由于陆续不断地参加各种课外活动，或眼看着许多同学参加了革命学校，自己也引起不安。除此以外，还有一部分学校，由于行政为极少数反动分子所操纵把持，有意纵容甚至嗾使学生中的反动分子和少数流氓学生从中捣乱。这种现象现在经过政府的领导与号召，靠了广大师生的共同努力，已经有很大的纠正，只有极少数私立中学仍然很少改进，必须继续加以克服。我们号召同学们团结起来，联合一切愿意为人民服务的爱护学校的师长来共同争取改造少数害群之马，并向扰乱或影响学习秩序的因素展开斗争。我们相信：在人民政府领导之下，少数学校中的散漫无秩序现象，会迅速为群从的力量所纠正。
    我们认为：正常学习秩序必须建立，但这种秩序应建立在发扬广大同学民主精神与自觉的基础之上，他不是封建的、反动的旧秩序的复活，相反的，对于一切法西斯的封建的即国民党统治学生压制束缚学生自由与创造性的东西，必须澈底扫清，旧的校规校纪中一切不合理的部分，也必须迅速废除。
    纠正散漫无秩序现象获得成绩的学校，大都是由学校师长负起领导责任并采取了正确的方针和方法，和同学们自觉的努力相结合来进行的，即师长们执行了人民政府的教育方针政策，负起责任，由学生会号召，学生中的共产党员青年团员与进步同学带头打通同学们的思想，用说服及学习竞赛等方式发动广大同学创造模范班，对散漫无秩序现象进行批评与自我批评。并对少数流氓学生进行必要的适当的斗争和争取改造。凡是进行了较深入的思想教育的，发扬了民主及自觉精神的，收效也较显著。但是，也有少数学校虽也获得成绩，但在整顿学校秩序的方法上却存在着单纯注意外表及单纯用行政命令来建立秩序的偏向，没有很好的从思想上发动同学，使同学们认识为什么要建立学习的秩序及如何建立这一秩序，也没有把建立秩序与学习革命思想、学好课业密切联系起来。在这样思想发动不够的学校中的同学，除了巩固已经初步建立的学习秩序外，还须进一步加强思想教育和思想领导，启发同学的民主精神与自觉性，建立正确的学习观点和学习态度，把学习搞好。
    对于一切学校的同学们，我们认为还应该继续进一步加强我们的政治学习，提高同学政治水准，建立巩固的革命的人生观，加强学习对人民民主事业有用的文化知识和科学技能，加紧培养自己成为人民大众的好勤务员。
    中学及专科学校和职业学校的一般课程中，目前国文课必须删除散布反动及有害思想的部分；旧的历史课贯串了为反动统治辩护的及唯心论的历史观点，课本必须尽速地更换。同学们对这些应改而尚未改革的课程表示不满并要求尽快改革，是完全正当的，忽视同学们这些意见是不对的。但同学们对这些课程与某些教授方法的改革与学校当局不民主的现象应采取积极改造态度，应积极提供意见，帮助与推动学校改进，不要用刷课等消极方式来对待。政治课对帮助同学学习革命理论，树立巩固的人生观是有帮助的，应该踊跃学习，忽视政治课是不对的。（个别私立学校自聘政治课教员不称职，政治课内容不当时，同学们应展开讨论批评，帮助其改进。）
    （三）在大学及独立学院中，旧学制及课程未按新民主主义教育方针作必要的改革，对同学们（尤其文法科的）学习的情绪影响很大。北大法律系的改制，证明了在大学中、特别是文法学院中，展开学习运动和学制改革是有着直接联系的。北大法律系改制前后，同学的学习情绪，由消极烦闷一变而为空前的积极热情，即是最好的说明。北大法律系改制过程中，启发了同学思想，团结了教授讲助，说服并团结了个别不同意改制的师长一同前进，这都是良好的经验。由于整个学制改革的过程，也就是贯彻新民主主义教育方针的过程，也是一个文化教育思想改造的斗争过程，所以这一工作基本上必须建立在广大同学和师长的共同认识及自觉的基础上，广泛吸收大家共同研究和推进。学制改革必须谨慎地有步骤的有准备的展开，消极等待是不对的。同学们应以积极态度帮助推动这一改革，把讨论研究的结果提供政府参考，争取暑期后能有较多的改进。但同时亦可建议学校，尽快和尽可能的增设若干新课，废除若干旧课程或改为选修。在工学院中，对于理论与实践脱节，对于妨碍到同学健康和学习效率的现象，也应适当加以改革。这样，可以在讨论学制及课程的过程中，提高同学对改革学制的认识，安定学习情绪，并在实际上促进新民主主义教育方针的早日实现。
    （四）适当的课外活动，社会服务活动，对于北平同学帮助推进人民革命运动，帮助同学自己思想的提高，革命人生观的建立上，起了很大作用，因此，必要的课外活动，应更好地组织进行，但曾经在一个时期中，有许多学校是不必要的课外活动的分量过多，而在学生会担任工作的同学负担尤其过重。这种由于领导上无计划的过多的不必要的社会活动（如布置了过多的会议，参加过多的校外的各项运动，耽搁课程进行文娱活动等），使得学习生活受到影响，功课成绩降低，并使积极分子因此脱离了广大同学，这一现象产生的另一主要原因是没有把课外活动的内容与学好正课相结合（正课未按新民主主义教育方针改革，亦是课外活动未能配合正课的原因之一）。目前这些现象已有了很大改进，广大同学认识到，不管国家大事不参加政治活动闭户读书的态度是不对的，但是不必要的课外活动应该废除，即必要的课外活动亦应力求不妨碍正课的学习，此外，在学生会担任工作的同学，应该把工作多分配给大家负担，减少不必要的会议，不开无准备的会议，把功课学好，在领导学习中，深入群众成为团结同学的核心。
    集体学习和学习互助，是推动学习与增进学习效率的一种方法，可适当提倡推进。但应有领导有准备地进行，并须以加强自学为其基础。应防止并纠正无领导无准备、一切依赖学习小组会的偏向，集体讨论的方法，在自然科学课程方面，应比社会科学课程方面减少其分量与时间。
    （五）同学们！富有光荣革命传统的北平同学，在今后建设新民主主义国家的伟业中，也应该起着光荣的作用，毛主席说：“解放战争的全面胜利，只是万里长征的第一步。”今后的建设工作，将比过去的斗争更艰巨困难。为此，同学们必须更加努力，在毛泽东旗帜之下，建立革命的人生观和世界观，学习新民主主义思想和理论，更进一步攻下科学技术的堡垒、掌握各种知识武器。努力培养自己成为建设国家的有用人才。因此，对于现在存在于学习前进道路上的障碍，必须全力逐渐加以克服，完成准备，以便进入正常的学习。
