Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 27th: TASS Berlin Dispatch: The Second Farmers' Congress of the German Soviet Zone opened here at the German Theater on the 23rd. A total of 360 delegates and more than 400 guests attended, including about 40 from West Germany.

The congress was opened by Otto Koerting, Chairman of the All-Soviet Zone Farmers' Mutual Aid Committee Federation.

Wilhelm Pieck, Chairman of the German Socialist Unity Party, addressed the congress, saying that the increasing unity between urban and rural areas is a reliable guarantee for the smooth development of the peaceful economy in the Soviet Zone. The Second All-Soviet Zone Farmers' Congress, attended by representatives of the most progressive part of the German countryside, will certainly contribute to the common cause of striving for German unification. Pieck called on the delegates to fight more actively for German unification.

Heinrich Rau, Chairman of the German Economic Commission, called on the representatives to help farmers prepare for the upcoming harvest by all means, regardless of region.

The speech given by Richard Schlinger, a representative of West German farmers, aroused great interest throughout the audience. He said: My comrades asked me to assure the congress that tens of millions of Germans in West Germany support German unification.

The General Secretary of the All-Soviet Zone Farmers' Mutual Aid Committee Federation gave a report to the congress. He said: The Farmers' Mutual Aid Committee Federation has done a lot of work. The federation's own agricultural machinery cultivated 440,000 hectares of farmers' land and harvested more than 200,000 tons of grain. Since the land reform, about 37,000 houses have been built for farmers. Within this year, another 34,000 houses and more than 40,000 various farm buildings will be built.
