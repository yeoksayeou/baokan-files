　　Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 25th: Paris dispatch: Under the strong opposition of the entire French people, the French National Assembly on the 22nd rejected the proposal of the Parliamentary Privileges Committee to revoke the parliamentary immunity of Maurice Thorez, General Secretary of the French Communist Party. Since the committee, on the 9th of this month, illegally passed a resolution to revoke Thorez's parliamentary immunity under the pretext that Thorez was accused of assault during the 1947 general election, the democratic people of France have risen up in protest. Countless trade union organizations and mass organizations in various regions and enterprises, as well as communist organizations in various towns and cities, have expressed their support for Thorez and opposed the French reactionaries' new offensive against the French Communist Party and the democratic rights of the people. The Trade Union Center of the 18th arrondissement of Paris, representing 31,000 trade union members in the district, issued a declaration stating: "There are plans to deprive the leaders of the workers of their freedom of speech. In order to eliminate the danger hanging over the heads of these worker leaders, immediate and resolute action must be taken." The people of Villeneuve-la-Garenne in the Seine department established a committee to defend the principle of universal suffrage, with participants from various parties and non-partisan individuals. A protest meeting of 5,000 people was held in Decazeville, Aveyron. This great mass strength of the French people has thwarted the insidious attempt of the French reactionaries to persecute Thorez.
