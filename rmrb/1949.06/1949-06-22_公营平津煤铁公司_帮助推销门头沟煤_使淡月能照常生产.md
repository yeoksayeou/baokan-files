    The publicly operated Pingjin Coal and Iron Company is vigorously helping to promote Mentougou coal, so that Mentougou mines can maintain normal production during the off-season. The Mentougou mechanized coal mines can produce 140,000 tons of coal per month, which is now handled through unified sales by the Beijing Branch of the Pingjin Coal and Iron Company. In previous years, serious sales stagnation occurred during the off-season from April to November, greatly impacting the production of various mines. At the beginning of this year's off-season, the same sales stagnation occurred. The Pingjin Coal and Iron Company immediately sought various methods, adhering to the principle of small profits and quick turnover, supplying various agencies, organizations, and merchants in the Pingjin area at low prices for bulk purchases. It also established coal yards in Dingxing and dispatched personnel to various counties along the Pingbao, Pingjin, and Pinggu railways to promote sales, supplying cheap fuel to rural areas (coal sales on the Pingbao line were about one-third lower than local coal prices). In the past half-month or so, the company's business has rapidly expanded, and the daily coal sales volume has increased more than tenfold. In addition, it has also purchased and stored large quantities of Mentougou coal in preparation for the winter needs of citizens. As a result, the problem of sluggish sales of Mentougou coal has been partially solved, maintaining normal production in various mechanized coal mines during the off-season, and ensuring no shortage of coal for use in the coming winter.
