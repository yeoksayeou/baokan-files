　　Replacing Old Comic Books with New Comic Books
　　Wu Lao
　　There have been many opinions put forward regarding the "comic book" issue: some criticize, some accuse, and some suggest banning them. In the current situation where old art is still massively poisoning the people, and new art is not sufficient to meet the needs, this is indeed a problem worth discussing. The content of "comic books" includes: fantastic romances, foolishly loyal men and women, chivalrous figures who rob the rich and help the poor, and obscene pornography, etc. Combined with their exquisite format and sequential drawings, they have become extracurricular reading for some children. Children waste time, spend money, and are also infected with a lot of poison. Some children are deeply poisoned, drawing cartoons of flying swords killing old Chiang, which is undoubtedly poisoned by the magical and Taoist comic books, insulting and damaging the pure, enthusiastic, and brave thoughts of children.
　　"Comic books" often change their themes. For example, after the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, there were "Wife Stealing," "Japanese Army's Atrocities," "Settling Blood Debts," "Miss's Tragic Fate," etc. Judging from the titles, they seem to reflect the life of the real society and have made progress compared to the old ones, but in reality, they still contain a lot of poison, repeating the Japanese army's rape five or six times in the same book, and some even more vulgar and lower-level performances. This will indeed affect the abnormal development of children's minds and bodies. We must not let hundreds and thousands of young minds be filled with these absurd things!
　　Therefore, today we should create a large number of new comic books, use this tool to cultivate children's requirements to meet the new democratic culture, depict the people's power that leaps forward, progresses, develops, grows, and strengthens in the struggle, and personally witness many moving and praiseworthy stories. We should not abandon it, we must express it in our paintings, so that it has the significance of inspiring and educating the new generation for the readers.
　　This form of "comic book" is more convenient than single-panel paintings for depicting rich content of real life, and can more closely and specifically convey thoughts and feelings. It is not only good reading material for primary school students, but also allows the masses and soldiers who are illiterate or have little literacy to obtain some necessary knowledge from these paintings. They want to learn some model examples, or hope that these model examples are themselves.
　　Why does it have such great magic for children? They often never tire of reading it. I think that in addition to the image of the painting itself, which is easy to understand directly, because its story is strong, tortuous, and expresses a thing from beginning to end, making readers like this thing. From the occurrence and development of the story, it can leave a little impression on the reader, giving him great interest. At the same time, because of the serial nature of the pictures, it easily arouses the reader's association, making it easier to remember.
　　The development of this work is urgently needed today. It requires organizing a large number of literary and art workers, especially art workers, to start this work. We must select themes that children can understand from the ever-changing reality. It is best to have characters and stories, and the story itself must run through the prominent character of the characters, and must not lose the center. Each plot must represent a very moving picture, and it must proceed more tensely from beginning to end. The connection of the pictures should still be based on the development process of the story itself, and should be connected to each other as much as possible (characters and background). The jumping should not be too large, and avoid the chaos of inserting east and west, so that readers can understand and be interested in reading it. The textual description should be as short and popular as possible, only to remedy the shortcomings of the picture and help readers better understand things. This can also take the form of dialogue, which will achieve better results. (End)

### 以新小人书代替旧小人书

　　以新小人书代替旧小人书
    吴劳
    关于“小人书”问题已有许多意见提出：有的批评，有的指责，有的建议取缔。这在旧艺术尚大量的毒害人民，新艺术不够满足需要的现状下，的确是值得讨论的一个问题。“小人书”的内容：有神奇的演义、愚忠愚孝的男女、打家劫舍的侠客、诲淫的色情等等，加上它精巧的形式，和连环图画，就使它成为一部分儿童的课外读物。儿童们耗费了时间，化了钱，还染了不少毒害。有中毒较深的小朋友，画那些祭起飞剑杀老蒋的漫画，无疑的，是受了神奇法道小人书的毒害，侮辱与损害了儿童纯洁热情勇敢的思想。
    “小人书”常常变换题材，如抗战胜利后出的“太太偷汉”、“日军暴行”、“清算血债”、“小姐红粉飘零”……等，从题目上看，象是反映现实社会的生活，比旧的有了进步，实际仍是含毒很深，把日军的强奸重复五六次的在同一本书里面出现，有的更下流、更低级的表现，这确是会影响儿童身心不正常的发展，我们决不能让成百成千幼小的心灵里，塞满这些荒唐的东西！
    因此，今天应该大量的创作新小人书，利用这一工具，来培养儿童适合新民主主义的文化的要求，描绘出在斗争生活中飞跃进步发展壮大强固的人民力量，身历目睹了许许多多可歌可泣的故事。我们不应该放弃它，必须在我们的绘画里表现出来，使它对读者有鼓舞、教育新一代的意义。
    “小人书”这种形式，比较单幅的画，更便于描绘丰富的现实生活的内容，能更周密、具体的传达思想感情，不仅对小学生们是好的读物，对不识字或识字不多的群众与战士也可以从这些画中获得一些必要的知识，他们想学一些模范例子，或者希望这些模范例子就是他自己。
    它对儿童为什么有这样大的魔力？常看不厌，我想除绘画本身的形象，容易直接了当的看懂之外，因为它的故事性强、曲折、有头有尾的表现一件事情，使读者欢喜这东西，从故事的发生发展，它可以或深或浅的留给读者一点印象，给与他极大的兴趣，同时因为画幅形象的连环，它容易唤起读者的联想，使记忆起来，比较方便。
    这工作的开展，在今天是急不容缓的，是需要组织大批的文艺工作者，尤其是美术工作者，着手进行这一工作。我们要从日见变化的现实中，选择儿童能够理解的题材，顶好是有人物、有故事，故事本身要贯串着人物的突出性格，还要不失掉中心。每一个情节都要代表着一个很动人的画面，而且从头到尾都较紧张的进行着。画面的衔接上，还是应该根据故事本身的发展过程，尽可能能够互相衔接（人物背景），跳动性不要太大，要避免东插西插的紊乱，做到读者看懂而有兴趣看下去。文字的说明要尽量少而通俗，仅以补救画面不足的地方，帮助读者更易了解事情，这亦可采取对话的形式，这样是会收得更好的效果。（完）
