The Evil Consequences of Coercive Orders!
  　Some Villages in Wuxun
  　Falsely Report Cotton Planting Figures
    [Our dispatch] A joint meeting of work team leaders was held in the Ninth District of Wuxun County, Jinnan on May 12th to inspect the rush planting work. Serious false reporting phenomena were discovered from the reports of various sub-districts. For example, Louzi Liu Village over-reported by twelve and a half mu, Le Village over-reported by fifteen mu, Ma Village reported the completion of the task, but in reality, some households (such as Ma Jinyu's family) had not planted even one mu, Lü Village over-reported by two-thirds, and Ning Zhuang's Ning Zhaojia reported planting one and a half mu of cotton, one mu of which was actually planted with sorghum. Similar examples are numerous. Due to insufficient ideological mobilization and lack of in-depth work, only administrative orders were used. The masses not only did not understand the production policies of the Communist Party and the People's Government, but also developed resistance. For example, Ning Jin'gang of Ning Village feared paying more public grain and under-reported, reporting one and a half mu of cotton for three mu planted. Some farmers misunderstood the call to plant cotton, thinking it was for the higher authorities. Two households in Xiao Village deliberately planted cotton seeds in dry soil, and Ning Zhaojia of Ning Village refused to plant flowers, saying, "If the higher authorities want cotton, let them buy it." At the same time, village cadres and Party members also engaged in false reporting. For example, the village cadre of Lü Village falsely reported figures, and the district cadre asked him to check, but he said, "You (referring to the district cadre) eat two jin of rice a day, and I still have to work!" The chairman of the Hua Luozhuang Village Government quarreled with the district cadre over leading production. After discussing these issues at the meeting, it was resolved that cadres in the entire district should go down in groups to conduct thorough inspections, vigorously publicize economic policies, dispel the ideological concerns of the masses, and specifically help the masses adjust manpower and animal power to complete the rush planting task. Now some villages have started to take action again.
    [Our dispatch] In the planting of economic crops in various parts of Jinnan, some areas have not paid enough attention to the ideological mobilization of the masses, and have made mistakes of coercive orders and formalism, causing the masses to doubt the leadership, and thus exhibiting phenomena such as passive resistance, perfunctory behavior, and deception. For example, in Zhangbazhai in the Second District of Wuxun, some households planted empty drills, some households boiled cotton seeds (as fertilizer) and mixed them with millet for planting (actually planting millet), and some under-reported. In Liangzhuang, Linqing, one household only planted at the edge of the field to deceive the cadres. In the Fourth District of Ji County, some were afraid of being discovered by the village cadres and got up at five o'clock to plant millet. Some people in Hengshui said, "They only care about planting, not about the harvest." At this critical moment for planting economic crops, all localities should conduct in-depth inspections, thoroughly correct the above deviations, and strive to complete the planting plan.

　　强迫命令的恶果！
  　武训有些村庄
  　假报种棉数字
    【本报讯】冀南武训县九区五月十二日召开各工作组长联席会议，检查抢种工作。从各小区的汇报中，发现了严重的假报告现象。如篓子刘村多报十二亩半，乐庄多报十五亩，马庄汇报完成任务，实际上有的户（如马金玉家）还一亩未点，吕庄多报三分之二，宁庄宁兆甲汇报种棉亩半，其中有一亩耩的是高粱，类似的例子还很多。由于思想发动不充分，工作不深入，只会用行政命令，群众不仅不了解共产党和人民政府的生产政策，而且发生抵抗情绪，如宁庄宁金岗怕多交公粮以多报少，种三亩棉花报亩半，有的农民对号召种棉发生误解，认为给上级种的。肖庄两户故意将棉籽耩到干土里，宁庄宁兆甲不耩花，他说：“上级要棉花给他买”。同时，村干部和党员也有假报现象，如吕庄村干假报数字，区干部让其检查，他说：“您（指区干）一天吃二斤米，俺还得干活哩！”花骆庄村政府主席因领导生产和区干吵嘴，会议上讨论了这些问题之后，决议全区干部分头下去，切实进行检查，大力宣传经济政策，解除群众思想顾虑，具体帮助群众调剂人力、畜力、完成抢种任务。现在有的村庄又已动作起来。
    【本报讯】冀南各地在经济作物的种植中，有些地区对群众的思想发动注意不够，犯了强迫命令与形式主义的错误；致使群众对领导上发生怀疑，因而表现了消极抵抗、应付与欺骗等现象。如武训二区张八寨有的户耩空耧，有的户把棉籽煮熟（作肥料）搀谷子耩（实际就是耩谷子），有的以少报多；临清梁庄有一户光耩地头，蒙蔽干部；冀县四区有的怕被村干发觉起五更耩谷子；衡水有的群众说：“管种不管出”。值此种植经济作物时间万分紧迫之际，各地应深入检查，彻底纠正以上偏向，争取种植计划的完成。
