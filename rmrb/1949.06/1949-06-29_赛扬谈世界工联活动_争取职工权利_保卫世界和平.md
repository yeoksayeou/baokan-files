　　赛扬谈世界工联活动
  　争取职工权利　保卫世界和平
    【新华社北平二十八日电】塔斯社巴黎讯：当世界职工联盟第二届代表大会将于六月二十九日在米兰开幕时，世界工联总书记赛扬顷接见人道报记者，发表谈话称：
    世界工联代表大会是在这样的一个时期开幕的，一方面，苏联和人民民主国家职工会活动的巩固和扩大；另一方面，资本主义国家工人阶级争取满足他们要求的运动的扩大，和工人阶级保卫职工会权利的斗争的加强。
    当记者询及自世界工联执委会上次会议以来的工联底活动时，赛扬答称：世界工联支持了为满足劳动人民要求的最重要的具有国际性的运动。其中最典型的就是加拿大海员的罢工。
    自一九四七年以来，世界工联一直在联合国经社理事会内继续其活动，保卫某些国家内职工会底一切权利免受侵犯。世界工联今年五月间曾向联合国秘书长莱氏建议，要求把消灭失业问题以及全劳动日问题列入将于今年七月五日在日内瓦召开的经社理事会第九届会议底议程内。
    世界工联也为成立各业职工部进行了广泛的工作。
    世界工联一直继续其保卫和平的活动。它参加过世界拥护和平大会。派遣代表团参加世界工联第二届代表大会的筹备工作，这是在“为劳动人民的团结”、“各国间的和平”的口号下进行的。
