　　Helping the Masses Conserve and Prepare for Famine
  　Providing Preferential Treatment for Members Buying and Exchanging Food Grains
  　Ding County Supply and Marketing Cooperative Deeply Welcomed by Farmers
    [Reported by this newspaper] At the beginning of this month, the Ding County Party Committee arranged for conservation and famine preparedness, emphasizing: using fine grains to exchange for coarse grains to save and economize, in order to achieve a steady flow. However, the general market situation was that coarse grains were in short supply, while fine grains were difficult to sell. The price of wheat in Mingyuedian once dropped to 580 yuan per dou (16 jin), not much higher than the price of millet. Farmers had to wait a day at the market to buy one or two dou of wheat, affecting production time. In order to solve this problem, the Ding County Supply and Marketing Cooperative specially contacted the Jizhong Supply and Marketing General Cooperative, which was responsible for temporarily transporting 200,000 jin of coarse grains to meet the needs of the people. On the 16th and 17th, 80,000 jin were transported to eight branch cooperatives, and 40,000 jin to the county cooperative, totaling 120,000 jin. Each branch immediately began selling. The Mingyuedian branch sold more than 24,000 jin in three days, most of which was exchanged for wheat. In addition, some wheat was purchased. Whether exchanging or buying wheat, members enjoyed preferential treatment: the cooperative purchased wheat from members at a price 2% higher than the market price, and sold or exchanged coarse grains to members at a price 3% lower than the market price, which was very welcomed by the members. Members in Pangjiazuo also automatically collected wheat for members, which influenced farmers in nearby villages to request membership. In Twenty-Five Li Pu, with only 30-plus households, more than 30 people bought shares. At the same time, the difficulties of non-members were also addressed appropriately. An old man in Zhou Village, over 50 years old, could not sell his wheat after waiting all day at the market. As a result, he sold it to the cooperative and bought a dou of corn from the cooperative. He happily said, "This is truly serving the people! Let my whole family join the cooperative when I get back."

　　帮助群众节约备荒
  　优待社员购换食粮
  　定县供销社深受农民欢迎
    【本报讯】定县县委于本月初布置节约备荒，着重提出：以细粮换粗粮省吃俭用，达到细水长流，但是市场一般情况，粗粮供不应求，而细粮则难以出售。明月店小麦价格每斗（十六斤）曾降到五百八十元，比小米价高不多少。农民为买一二斗麦子，也得在集上等一天，影响了生产时间。为了解决这一个问题，定县供销社特与冀中供销总社联系，由冀中供销总社负责，暂运粗粮二十万斤以供民需。于十六、十七两日即运到八个分社共八万斤，县社四万斤共十二万斤。各分社当即开始出售，明月店分社三天出售两万四千多斤，大部分是换的麦子。另外还买了一部分麦子。无论换麦与买麦，社员均享受优待：高于市价百分之二收换社员的麦子，低于市价百分之三卖给或换给社员粗粮，社员都很欢迎。庞家佐的社员还自动给社员收麦子，这样影响了附近村的农民纷纷要求入社。仅三十多户的二十五里铺，就有三十多人入了股。同时也酌情解决了非社员的困难。周村一个五十多岁的老头，在集上卖麦子、等了一天卖不了，结果卖到社里，又从社里买了一斗玉米，他高兴的说：“这才真是为人民服务哩！回去让我一家子全入股。”
