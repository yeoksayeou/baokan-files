　　Introduction to Magic Lanterns in the Taihang District
    Zhao Fengchuan

　　The Fine Arts Department of the Taihang Cultural Association began experimenting with magic lanterns last winter. Initially, they produced a magic lantern film on current affairs, providing a systematic introduction to the People's Liberation War of the past two and a half years from military, political, and economic perspectives. This film was shown thirteen times in places like Wu'an and Shexian, with each showing attracting approximately 2,000 viewers. Cadres and the masses alike felt the production was novel and left a deep impression. For example, in Wu'an city, it was shown for three consecutive nights, each night with an exceptionally crowded audience. Everyone greeted the projected giant images of Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu, as well as films of the Liu-Deng army crossing the river, the Northeast Liberation Army attacking Jinzhou, and operations entering the pass, with excited applause and cheers. In particular, during the march of the army southward, the audience unconsciously stamped their feet in unison, closely aligning with the active films on the screen, creating a magnificent "thump, thump" sound.
    In Paihuai Town, Wu'an, the audience packed the main street one evening, with people even crowding on rooftops and tree branches. When the performance reached its climax, the audience watched even more attentively. If someone accidentally made a noise, everyone would immediately and automatically prohibit them: "Don't shout!" But when the fleeing Kuomintang bandit army was shown, the entire audience immediately burst into jeers. Especially when seeing groups of prisoners being escorted by People's Liberation Army soldiers across the screen, they all said: "Look! This is the end of counter-revolutionaries fighting a civil war." A village cadre said: "Watching this film (magic lantern) is more effective than attending a month of winter school. Previously, we only talked about how powerful our field army was and how good our weapons were, but the masses in the old liberated areas haven't seen much of it in recent years, so they were somewhat unclear. Now they can see everything."
    When shown in Mabu and Xixu, Shexian, the weather was very cold, but the audience was still large. Many women, after watching a few scenes, said: "Quick, go back and call my mother! It's so good!" Some old women hurried back to call their daughters-in-law out to watch. Before long, the main street was crowded with people, all looking up and vying to see.
    This spring, the second production, a film on production, was shown in Xixu. When the masses saw a liberated peasant diligently producing with his family after receiving his land certificate, they showed an envious expression, saying: "With a land certificate, there's energy for production!" And when the contrast between mutual aid and individual production was shown, seeing mutual aid teams weeding quickly and well, while an individual weeding neglected the land, the masses said with a mocking tone: "Look, weeding alone, a rain came, and the land is neglected!" When the labor hero was compared with the lazy man, several old men in the back said: "Humph! Our village has one person who only eats 'struggle meals,' eating all day without working. He will end up like the one in the film, truly shameful." Finally, after the masses saw how workers and peasants everywhere enthusiastically responded to Chairman Mao's call to increase production by an inch, as well as various policies and decrees on rewarding the development of production, they all said: "This year, we must produce well. Increasing production by an inch is Chairman Mao's idea for us."
    In short, no matter where it was shown, after each performance, the audience was always reluctant to leave, as if wanting to continue watching. But the "The End" sign was already projected, so everyone had to slowly walk home while discussing the content of the film.
    The above facts prove that the magic lantern is indeed a powerful propaganda weapon and educational tool. It can have such an effect because it has many advantages:
    First, vivid and concentrated: The pictures of the magic lantern, projected onto the screen through two lenses, are much more vivid than the original paintings. Coupled with colorful coloring, it appears even more colorful, particularly vivid and eye-catching.
    Second, it can simultaneously conduct propaganda to thousands of mass cadres, so its effect is greater than that of peep shows, puppet shows, and comic strips.
    Third, simple to produce, timely materials: The production and installation of magic lanterns are very simple. All that is needed is a lamp box, a screen, a gasoline lamp, and pictures. When performing, two or three people can carry it around to perform anywhere.
    Fourth, active and continuous: The projection of magic lantern pictures is originally static (but it is a work of art), but we make it move up and down, horizontally and interlaced (such as rowing, driving, marching, raining, etc., can all be active), just like a colorful movie, increasing the infinite power of the magic lantern. Therefore, in the Taihang District, cadres and the masses call it "earth movie" or "small movie."
    Fifth, it can arbitrarily express scenery that cannot be expressed by stage plays, but the degree of its authenticity is no less than that of stage plays. For example, to portray a labor hero or a combat hero, truthfully express his appearance, life, and environment. This has a great effect on the local masses' propaganda education and promotion of work. The masses are willing to "report" their achievements in production and supporting the front, and are even more willing to "get on the movie" (magic lantern), believing that getting on the report and the movie is the most glorious thing.

　　太行区的幻灯介绍
    赵枫川
    太行文协美术部于去年冬天开始试制幻灯，起初绘制了一部时事幻灯影片，把两年半的人民解放战争从军事、政治、经济各方面作了一个系统的介绍。这个片子曾在武安、涉县等地出演过十三次，每次观众均在二千人左右，干部和群众看了以后都感到制作新奇，印象深刻，如在武安城连演了三个晚上，每晚观众都是拥挤异常，大家对映出的毛主席、朱总司令巨像，以及刘邓大军渡河，东北解放军攻打锦州、人关作战等影片，都报以兴奋的掌声和欢呼，特别是在大军南下的进军中，观众都不自觉地一齐合拍地踏着脚步和幕布上活动的影片紧紧结合起来，发出“通通”的雄壮响声。
    在武安徘徊镇演了一个晚上，观众把一道大街挤的水泄不通，连屋顶上、树枝上都挤满了人。当演到最精彩处、观众更聚精会神地看着，如果有那个人偶而嚷嚷几句，大家马上就会自动禁止：“不准乱嚷呀！”但当演到蒋匪军狼狈逃窜时，全场又立时发出了嘲笑声，特别看见一群群的俘虏被解放军战士押着在银幕上走过时，都说：“看！这就是反革命打内战的下场。”有个村干部说：“看了这回电影（幻灯），比我们上一个月的冬学还强的多，以前光说咱的野战军力量怎样强大，武器怎样好，可是在老解放区的群众这几年没有多见过，总有些不大明白，这一回可什么也看见了。”
    在涉县马布、西戌放演时，天气很冷，观众仍然很多。有许多妇女看了几片后，说：“快回去叫俺娘呀！这么好！”有的老太婆急忙回去叫她媳妇出来看，不一会，一条大街便挤满了人，大家都仰着头，争着看。
    今春第二次在西戌出演生产影片，当群众看到一个翻身农民在领了土地证后和家庭一起订计划勤劳生产时，都表现出一种羡慕的神气说：“领到土地证，生产就是有劲！”又当放演互助与个人生产对比时，看到互助拔苗又快又好，一个人拔苗荒了地，群众就带着嘲笑的口气说：“瞧瞧，一个人拔苗，下了一场雨，荒啦！”演到劳动英雄与懒汉对比时，有好几个老汉在后边说：“哼！俺村就有一个光吃‘斗争饭’的人，一天净吃不干，将来也得和电影上一样，真丢人。”最后群众看了各地工人、农民如何热烈响应毛主席提出生产长一寸的号召，以及关于奖励发展生产的各种政策法令后都说：“今年可得好好生产，生产长一寸是毛主席给咱出的主意。”
    总之，无论在那个地方出演，每次演完，观众总是恋恋不舍，好象还要一直看下去，可是“全部完”的牌子已经映了出来，大家只好一边谈论着影片的内容，慢慢地走回家去。
    从以上事实证明：幻灯确是一个有力的宣传武器和教育工具，它所以能有这样的效力，是因为它本身即具有许多优点：
    第一、生动集中：幻灯的画片通过两个镜头，放映到影幕上，就比原画要生动的多。再加上五彩涂色，就更显得色彩鲜艳，格外生动醒目。
    第二、能同时对千人以上的群众干部进行宣传，所以它比拉洋片、木人戏、连环画的作用要更大。
    第三、制作简便，取材及时：幻灯的制作和装置都很简单，只要一个灯箱，一块影幕，一盏汽灯，再画上片子就行了。出演时，有两三个人担上它就可到处出演。
    第四、活动连续：幻灯画片的放映，本来是静止的（不过是一幅美术品），可是我们把它上下横穿交织的活动起来（如划船、行车、进军、下雨等，都可以活动），就和五彩电影一样，增加了幻灯无限力量，所以在太行区，干部、群众都叫它“土电影”或“小电影”。
    第五、能随意表现为舞台剧所无法表现的景物，但其真实性的程度却不减于舞台剧。比如要表现一个劳动英雄，或战斗英雄，把他的面貌、生活、环境都真实表现出来，这对当地群众的宣传教育和推动工作的作用都很大。群众生产支前有了成绩，都愿意“上报”，更愿意“上电影”（幻灯），认为上了报和电影是件最光荣不过的事情。
