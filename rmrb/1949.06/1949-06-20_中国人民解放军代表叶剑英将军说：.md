　　General Ye Jianying, representative of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, said:
    Although the Preparatory Committee of the New Political Consultative Conference has only 134 representatives, it represents 23 units, 11 political parties, more than 4 million soldiers of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, the entire working class of the country, all people in the liberated areas, figures from industrial and commercial circles, democratic figures from cultural circles, democratic professors, young people, women, and students across the country, domestic minority ethnic groups, and overseas Chinese. It can be said that the representatives of the Preparatory Committee of the New Political Consultative Conference have sufficient representation for the vast majority of people in the country. Chairman Mao has correctly pointed out the tasks of this preparatory meeting: "To complete all necessary preparatory work, to quickly convene a new Political Consultative Conference, to establish a democratic coalition government, and to lead the people of the whole country to eliminate the remaining forces of the Kuomintang reactionaries at the fastest speed, to unify the whole of China, and to carry out political, economic, cultural, and international construction work in a systematic and step-by-step manner throughout the country." In the two-day meeting, I believe that the spirit of unity and democratic style of all representatives will surely guarantee the victorious completion of the sacred mission of the Preparatory Committee of the New Political Consultative Conference.

　　中国人民解放军代表叶剑英将军说：
    新政协筹备会的代表，虽然只有一百三十四个人，但是他代表着二十三个单位，代表着十一个党派，代表着四百多万的中国人民解放军，代表全国的工人阶级、解放区人民全体、产业界、文化界的民主人士、民主教授，代表着全国的青年、妇女、学生，代表着国内少数民族、海外华侨，可以说新政协筹备会的代表对于全国的绝大多数的人民有十分足够的代表性。这个筹备会的任务，毛主席已经正确的指出：“完成各项必要的准备工作，迅速召开新的政治协商会议，成立民主联合政府，以至领导全国人民以最快速度肃清国民党反动派的残余力量，统一全中国，有系统的和有步骤的在全国范围内进行政治的、经济的、文化的和国际的建设工作。”在两天的会战中，我对于全体代表的团结精神及民主作风相信一定能够保证新政协筹备会的神圣任务的胜利完成。
