　　Peiping Construction Workers' Union Established
  　Construction Workers Unite to Overcome Guildism
    [This newspaper] Peiping City Construction Workers' Union was formally established yesterday (29th) at 9:00 AM. Sixty-five representatives of construction workers from fifteen districts attended. Comrade Xiao Ming, Director of the Preparatory Committee of the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions, attended and expressed three hopes for the Construction Workers' Union: First, construction workers must unite and organize well in the future, and overcome the guild-like practices of small groups and factions of the past. To achieve this goal, members must be selfless, educate and persuade non-members, and strive to absorb all construction workers as members. Second, in the new society, in order to learn to be masters of our own house, we must establish a new labor attitude, overcome the work-dragging habits cultivated in the old society, and work well under a reasonable wage system. Third, intensify learning, raise awareness, and achieve the goal of uniting and improving ourselves. The conference discussed and approved the "Draft Constitution of the Construction Workers' Union" and the "Draft Labor-Capital Contract for the Construction Industry," and elected Yuan Zhi and 16 others as executive committee members.

　　平建筑业工会成立
  　建筑工人团结起来克服行会主义
    【本报讯】平市建筑业职工会昨（二十九）日上午九时正式成立。到会十五个区建筑工人代表六十五名。市职工总会筹委会主任萧明同志曾莅会说明对建筑业职工会的三点希望：第一，建筑业工人今后要好好团结起来，组织起来，克服过去小团体小宗派的行会主义的作风。为达到此目的，会员必须大公无私，对非会员进行教育说服工作，争取吸收全部建筑工人为会员。第二，在新社会中为了学会当家作主人，要建立新的劳动态度，克服在旧社会中养成的磨洋工作风，在合理工资制度下，好好工作。第三，加紧学习，提高觉悟，达到团结和提高自己的目的。大会讨论并通过“建筑业职工会章程草案”及“建筑业劳资契约草案”，选出袁峙等十七人为执委。　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　（鸣）
