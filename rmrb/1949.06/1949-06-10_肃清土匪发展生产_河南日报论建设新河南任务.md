Xinhua News Agency, Kaifeng, 9th. In its inaugural editorial, the Henan Daily, the organ of the Henan Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, which was launched on the 1st of this month, discussed the current tasks of the people of Henan in the situation of the liberation of the entire province and the victory of neighboring regions, stating: From now on, Henan must extensively mobilize the masses, restore and develop production with focus and in a step-by-step manner, implement the principles of democratic reform and social reform, build a new democratic people's New Henan and advance the national liberation cause. However, at present, the Kuomintang reactionary remnants are making a last-ditch struggle, organizing bandits, instigating secret societies, spreading rumors and sabotage, creating disturbances and looting, directly endangering the interests and safety of the people of all classes, and hindering the progress of revolutionary work. Therefore, the task placed before the party, government, army and people of Henan is to resolutely implement the working principle of focusing on comprehensive bandit suppression, and to closely combine bandit suppression with anti-local tyrant and mass mobilization. As long as the entire party and army work together, correctly implement the policy of bandit suppression, resolutely implement the principle of arduous combat, and truly mobilize and organize a united front of all classes against bandits, we will certainly be able to eliminate the bandits completely. Secondly, we must strengthen urban production and construction, restore and develop industry and commerce, correctly implement the "four directions, eight sides" policy as instructed by Chairman Mao, stabilize the people's livelihood, develop production, eliminate disasters, and eradicate the source of bandits. At present, in order to quickly overcome the stagnation and difficulties of the urban and rural economy, public and private enterprises must work together to operate, earnestly solve the problem of trade and transportation inside and outside the province, and ensure smooth communication between the inside and outside to promote the restoration and development of industrial and agricultural production. The newspaper pointed out: In order to ensure the implementation of the above tasks, the entire party must be unified in thought and action, heighten vigilance, overcome paralysis, prevent and overcome some erroneous tendencies in our ranks such as arrogance and complacency, stagnation, corruption and enjoyment, unwillingness to endure hardship, and bureaucracy. Leading organs of party committees at all levels must seize the time to rectify the party and train cadres, strengthen the education of cadres in service, improve the level of theoretical politics, improve the style of work, strengthen the unity of the entire party, and further unite the 28 million people of Henan Province, and move victoriously towards the direction of consolidating and building a new Henan and building a new China.

　　肃清土匪发展生产
  　河南日报论建设新河南任务
    【新华社开封九日电】本月一日创刊的中共河南省委机关报河南日报在发刊词中论述河南省人民在全境解放、四邻胜利的形势下的当前任务称：今后河南必须广泛发动群众，有重点有步骤地恢复与发展生产，贯彻实现民主改革与社会改革方针，建设新民主主义的人民的新河南与推进全国解放事业。但是，目前国民党反动残余正在作垂死挣扎，组织土匪，策动会门，造谣破坏，骚动抢劫，直接危害各阶层人民的利益与安全，阻碍革命工作的前进，因而摆在全河南党政军民面前的任务，就是要坚决实行以全面剿匪为中心的工作方针，并使剿匪与反恶霸、发动群众密切结合。只要全党全军一致努力，正确执行剿匪政策，坚决贯彻艰苦作战的方针，真正发动和组织各阶层反匪的统一战线，我们就一定能将土匪消灭得干干净净。其次，必须加强城市生产建设，恢复和发展工商业，正确实现毛主席所指示的四面八方政策，安定人民生活，发展生产，消弭灾荒，根绝匪源。目前，为了迅速克服城乡经济呆滞困难，就必须公私企业一齐努力经营，认真解决省内外贸易运输问题，务使内外沟通，货畅其流，以促进工、农业生产的恢复与发展。该报指出：为了保证上述任务的贯彻实施，必须全党思想一致，行动一致，提高警惕，克服麻痹，防止与克服我们队伍中若干骄傲自满、停滞不前、贪污享乐、不愿吃苦、官僚主义等项错误倾向。各级党委领导机关更须抓紧时间，进行整党和训练干部，加强在职干部教育，提高理论政治水平，改进工作作风，加强全党团结，更进而团结全河南省二千八百万人民，朝着巩固、建设新河南与建设新中国的方向，胜利前进。
