North China Farm Sends Personnel to Assist Farmers
　　Treating Aphids and Eliminating Pests to Protect Cotton Seedlings

[Our Newspaper's Report] In the rural areas near Shijiazhuang, cotton aphids and red spiders have appeared successively. In order to guarantee increased cotton production, the Shijiazhuang North China Farm, directly under the Ministry of Agriculture of the North China People's Government, responded to the government's call to eliminate pests and protect seedlings, dispatching a large number of technical cadres to various districts in the suburbs to carry out aphid control work. This aphid control mainly uses a mixture of tobacco and lime water, sprayed on the cotton seedlings, which has been very effective and easy to promote.

When the work team first went to the countryside, the villagers said, "The Japanese devils and the Kuomintang used foreign medicines and couldn't get rid of the aphids, how can tobacco and lime water be useful?" Some said, "The aphids are not too bad yet, let's wait and see." The farm cadres immediately conducted practical experiments. The aphids on the cotton seedlings that had been sprayed with the mixture were all killed, and the villagers then believed it. However, many farmers developed a mentality of dependence, hoping that the government could completely eliminate the aphids. After persuasion and education, the enthusiasm of the masses for aphid control was mobilized. During the process, the combination of farm cadres and administrative cadres played a great role, and great achievements have been made, with aphids visibly reduced.

[Another News Item] Huolu County discovered aphids. County Magistrate Wei Shanqi specially sent people to the North China Farm to invite cadres to be transferred to eliminate them. The farm has sent Zhang Shuangzhen, the leader of the third work team, to Huolu to discuss work methods, and then a large number of cadres can be sent to do practical work.

Some places in the Jianping Special District also discovered cotton aphids. The leadership immediately invited the North China Farm to quickly send technical personnel to assist in prevention and control. The farm temporarily transferred twelve cadres from various districts, led by Yang Qingzheng, the head of the promotion section, to participate in the pest control meeting held in the Jianping Special District, to study the distribution of personnel to regions, and launch a blitzkrieg against aphids.

(Correspondent from Jizhong, Li Feng) The weather is hot, and cotton fields in Wuji County have generally experienced aphids. Generally, the situation is more serious for Da Yang cotton, and lighter for Yanghua and small-rooted cotton interplanted with wheat. In the second and fourth districts, the general cotton seedlings are at the tip, and aphids are clustered together, seriously preventing the development of cotton seedlings. Farmers are quite anxious and urgently request elimination and treatment. This situation has aroused the serious attention of the leadership. In addition to reporting to the Agricultural and Forestry Section of the Ninth Special District by telephone, cadres from the County Agricultural Extension Station went to the second, fourth, and eighth districts, where the insect pests were more severe, on June 3 to lead farmers in catching and killing them, and introduced the method of eliminating and treating them with lime tobacco water. After Comrade Zhang Shaorong, the head of the station, arrived in the fourth district, he introduced and studied the elimination and treatment methods at cadre meetings and old farmer symposiums. Now he is vigorously leading and helping farmers to eliminate and treat the pests.

　　华北农场派员协助农民
  　治蚜除虫保护棉苗
    【本报讯】石家庄近郊农村，棉花蚜虫及红蜘蛛陆续发生，为了保证棉花增产，华北人民政府农业部直属的石家庄华北农场，响应政府除虫保苗的号召，派出大批技术干部，到近郊各区展开治蚜工作。这次治蚜主要是用烟草、石灰水的配制，喷射在棉苗上，收效很大且易推广。
    在工作组刚下乡的时候，老乡们说：“日本鬼子和国民党用洋药水都没有把蚜虫治掉，烟草石灰水能会有用么？”有的说：“蚜虫还不太厉害呢，等一等再说吧。”农场干部当即实际实验，被喷射过药水的棉苗上的蚜虫全被杀死，老乡们才相信了。但不少农民又发生了依赖思想，希望政府能把蚜虫完全消灭掉。经过说服教育，才发动起群众治蚜热情。在进行中农场干部与行政干部结合发挥力量很大，现已获得很大成绩，蚜虫显见减少。
    【又讯】获鹿县发现蚜虫，县长魏善琦特派人到华北农场邀请抽调干部前去除治，农场已派第三工作组组长张双振到获鹿去商定工作办法后，即可派大批干部去实际工作。
    建屏专署有些地方，也发现了棉蚜，领导上当即邀请华北农场赶快派技术人员协助防治。农场临时由各区抽调干部十二人，由推广科科长杨清政率领，赶往参加建屏专区召开的治虫会议，研究人员分配地区，展开对蚜虫的突击歼灭战。

    【冀中讯】天气炎热，无极全县棉田普遍发生蚜虫，一般情况是大洋棉较重，麦间点种的洋花及小本棉较轻，二、四两区一般棉苗尖顶，蚜虫聚成一团，严重防害了棉苗的发育，农民颇感焦虑，迫切要求除治。此情况已引起领导上的严重注意，县委除用电话报告九专署农林科外，县农业推广场干部并于六月三日分赴虫灾较重的二、四、八区领导农民捕杀，并介绍用石灰烟草水除治的方法。场长张绍荣同志到四区后，在干部会议上及老农座谈会上介绍及研究除治方法。现在大力领导与帮助农民除治。
