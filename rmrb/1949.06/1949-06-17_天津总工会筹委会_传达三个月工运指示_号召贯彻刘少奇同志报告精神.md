Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, 16th. The Tianjin Federation of Trade Unions Preparatory Committee convened an enlarged meeting of cadres on the 12th, where Qiu Jin, Deputy Director of the Preparatory Committee, conveyed instructions for the city's labor movement work for June, July, and August. The instructions pointed out that the general task for the next three months is to deeply convey and study the spirit of Comrade Liu Shaoqi's reports during his visit to Tianjin and the resolutions of the North China Workers' Representative Conference. This is to implement democratic factory management in public enterprises, strengthen worker unity, and adjust production structures; in private enterprises, to implement the policy of benefiting both labor and capital, adjust labor-capital relations, in order to enhance the enthusiasm of workers and capitalists in production, and achieve the goal of restoring and developing production. In conjunction with these tasks, workers' representative conferences at all levels should be systematically convened from top to bottom, preparatory committees for trade unions in various industries and sectors should be established, and then trade unions at all levels should be established, as well as a city-wide Federation of Trade Unions.

The instructions further pointed out that the focus of work in public enterprises should be on implementing democratic factory management and establishing a new democratic style of work; worker unity can be combined with this work. To this end: (1) Factory management committees and workers' representative conferences should be rapidly established and improved, so that the production and management of enterprises and factories can be built on the basis of workers' consciousness and initiative. (2) The principle of stability should be adopted in transforming some inapplicable and unreasonable systems in some enterprises. At the same time, individual personnel adjustments should be made in certain production structures according to specific circumstances. In order to systematically solve the problem of adjusting enterprise structures and personnel, a special committee should be established with the participation of relevant enterprise administrative departments and trade unions. The instructions emphasized that in carrying out this work, thorough publicity and explanation should be given to the workers, and those laid-off workers should be given genuine concern and care in their lives. Vigilance should be maintained against special agent saboteurs taking the opportunity to instigate discord. When all plans, steps, and handling methods are fully prepared, it is necessary to report to the higher authorities for instructions and approval. (3) According to the resolutions of the North China Workers' Representative Conference, collective contracts should be quickly drawn up to establish correct public-private relations in public enterprises and to give full play to the enthusiasm and creativity of the workers in production. (4) Strengthening worker unity lies in organizing workers to jointly and deeply study Comrade Shaoqi's report, so that both workers and staff can recognize the importance of combining physical and mental labor in developing production. In particular, workers should understand that staff members are part of the working class, and problems between workers and staff should be treated as internal family problems. The instructions pointed out that strengthening worker unity and transforming the thinking of staff members is a long-term and arduous educational task, and the development of acute problems should be prevented.

Regarding work in private enterprises, the instructions pointed out that to ensure the livelihood of workers and to reassure capitalists to develop production, the central link lies in organizing workers to repeatedly discuss Comrade Shaoqi's report and the "Provisional Measures for Handling Labor-Capital Relations." First, leading cadres must deeply study and understand its spirit and essence, and must concentrate their efforts to patiently strengthen worker education in various ways and methods. Regarding the resolution of labor-capital disputes, the instructions pointed out that various representative conferences, representative meetings, and forums should be convened according to the system of an industry or sector, and after a comprehensive and systematic investigation and study, unified principles or plans for solving problems should be determined. Then, labor and capital should be convened to negotiate and agree to sign collective contracts. With clear regulations, each factory can then solve the problem according to the principles and its own actual situation. The instructions particularly pointed out that solving labor-capital disputes in a piecemeal, individual, and therefore passive manner, often results in many side issues and increased disputes. Regarding solving various specific problems in private enterprises that are obviously unreasonable and hinder workers from giving full play to their productive enthusiasm, the instructions pointed out that it is necessary to strive for workers to agree with the capitalists to solve them on a conscious basis. At the same time, capitalists should be encouraged to truthfully and openly report the operating situation and difficulties of the factory to the workers, and to humbly listen to the opinions of the workers. However, it is also necessary to be vigilant against individual capitalists distorting the spirit of Comrade Shaoqi's report and making excessive and unreasonable demands on the workers.

The instructions finally pointed out that in order to complete the above tasks and put the city's labor movement on the right track, in addition to all worker cadres studying Comrade Shaoqi's instructions in connection with their own thinking and practical work, it is necessary to rely on the work foundation established since entering the city and quickly establish trade unions at all levels. In industries with a working foundation (such as railways, textiles, hardware, chemicals, etc.), workers' representative conferences in each industry should be convened immediately to produce a preparatory committee for the industry's trade union, and actively train key members for trade union work in each factory, and conduct short-term organizational education work to enable them to understand the nature, policies, and tasks of the trade union, and then formulate the industry's (or sector's) trade union's constitution and begin registering members. Existing representative meetings in each factory that are trusted by the workers can develop members to form a trade union with the approval of the industry's (or sector's) trade union preparatory committee, without having to set up a preparatory committee in the factory. Generally, a trade union can be established when the number of members reaches more than half of the total number of workers in the factory, but in special circumstances, it can also be established with the approval of the Federation of Trade Unions Preparatory Committee. When trade unions have been established in more than half of the units in an industry or sector, a members' representative conference can be convened to establish the industry's trade union. After more than half of the industry's and sector's trade unions have been established, a city-wide members' representative conference will be convened to formally establish the Tianjin Federation of Trade Unions.

For industries or sectors with no working foundation or a weak working foundation, universal training of activists should be adopted to cultivate key members, and workers' representative conferences should be convened quickly to establish the industry's or sector's trade union preparatory committee.

The instructions emphasized that when establishing trade unions and recruiting members, it is necessary to ensure the broad mass nature of the trade union. This should be paid attention to from the beginning of initiating the organization of the trade union. The method of taking a small number of activists as basic members is inappropriate. For workers who have participated in reactionary organizations such as the Kuomintang's Three Youth Corps in the past, if they are not lurking special agents or responsible members above the district committee level, as long as they declare that they have withdrawn from the reactionary organization and have indeed stopped counter-revolutionary activities, they can be admitted to the union.

　　天津总工会筹委会
    传达三个月工运指示
  　号召贯彻刘少奇同志报告精神
    【新华社天津十六日电】天津市总工会筹委会于十二日召开干部扩大会，由筹委会副主任丘金传达津市六、七、八三个月工运工作的指示。指示指出今后三个月工作的总任务是：深入传达与学习刘少奇同志来津时的几次报告的精神与华北职工代表会议的决议，以便在公营企业中，贯彻工厂管理民主化，加强职工团结和调整生产机构；在私营企业中，贯彻执行劳资两利的方针，调整劳资关系，以提高职工和资本家在生产中的积极性，达到恢复和发展生产的目的。结合这些工作，要自上而下地有系统地召开各级职工代表大会，建立各产业、行业的职工会筹备委员会，进而成立各级职工会，和建立全市职工总会。
    指示继指出：公营企业工作的中心应放在贯彻工厂管理民主化、建立新的民主的工作作风上面；职工团结可结合这一工作来进行。为此，（一）迅速建立和健全工厂管理委员会和职工代表会议，以便使企业工厂的生产与管理，建筑在职工的自觉性与积极性的基础之上。（二）对有些企业中不适用和不合理的制度应掌握稳重的方针，加以改造，同时根据具体情况在某些生产机构中进行个别人事调整。为着有系统地来解决调整企业机构与人事的问题，应建立由各有关企业行政部门及职工会参加的专门委员会。指示强调指出在进行这一工作时，应向职工进行深入的宣传解释，对于被解雇的职工，更应确实给予生活上的关心与照顾，并要警惕特务破坏分子乘机挑拨离间。当一切计划、步骤及处理方法准备充分后，务须报告上级请示批准。（三）根据华北职工代表会议决议，迅速订立集体合同，以树立公营企业中正确的公私关系，发挥职工群众在生产中的积极性与创造性。（四）加强职工团结，关键在于组织职工共同深入学习少奇同志报告，使职工双方认识到体力劳动和脑力劳动在发展生产中结合的重要，尤应使工人了解到职员是工人阶级的一部分，职工间的问题应按一家人内部问题来处理。指示指出加强职工团结与改造职员思想，是一个长期艰巨的教育工作，要防止产生急性病。
    关于私营企业工作，指示指出：要使职工生活有保障而资本家又安心发展生产，其中心环节在于组织职工反复讨论少奇同志的报告与“劳资关系暂行处理办法”。首先领导干部要深入研究体会其精神与实质，并须集中精力耐心地以各种方式方法来加强职工教育。关于解决劳资纠纷，指示指出应按照一种产业或行业的系统，召集各种代表大会、代表会议、座谈会，并经过全面的系统的调查研究，决定统一的解决问题的原则或方案，然后召集劳资双方谈判协议，订立集体合同。有了明确规定之后，各厂再根据本身实际情况，按照原则进行解决。指示特别指出：对劳资纠纷以手工业方式零星地，个别地因而是被动地解决问题，结果往往是枝节丛生，增加纠纷。关于解决私营企业中某些显然不合理的、障碍职工发挥生产积极性的各种具体问题，指示指出必须争取职工在自觉的基础上与资方协议解决。同时要鼓励资本家真实公开地向职工报告工厂经营的情况和困难，虚心听取职工意见。但也必须警惕个别资本家曲解少奇同志报告的精神，向职工提出过分的与不合理的要求。
    指示最后指出：为了完成以上任务，使全市职工运动走上正规，除全体职工干部应联系自己的思想和实际工作，认真学习少奇同志的指示外，必须依靠入城以来所建立的工作基础，迅速地建立各级工会。凡有工作基础的产业（如铁路、纺织、五金、化学等）应立即着手召开各产业的职工代表大会，产生该产业工会筹委会，并积极培养各厂工会工作的骨干分子，进行短期的组织教育工作，使他们了解工会性质、方针和任务等，然后拟定该产业（或行业）工会的章程，开始登记会员。凡在职工群众中有信仰的各工厂现有代表会，经该产业（或行业）工会筹委会的批准，即可发展会员成立工会，不必再另设该厂筹委会。一般的规定入会会员达到全厂职工半数以上时，即可成立工会，但特殊情况，经总工会筹委会批准后也可成立。一种产业或行业有半数单位已建立工会时，即可召开会员代表大会，建立该业工会。各产业、行业工会成立过半数后，即召开全市会员代表大会，正式建立天津市总工会。
    凡工作无基础或工作基础薄弱的产业或行业，应采取普遍训练积极分子以培养骨干，迅速地召集职工代表大会，进而建立该产业或行业的工会筹备会。
    在建立工会吸收会员时，指示强调一定要保证工会广泛的群众性，从发起组织工会时就应注意这点，先以少数积极分子为基本会员的办法是不妥当的。对过去参加过国民党三青团等反动组织的职工，如非潜伏的特务分子或区分委以上的负责分子，只要他们声明脱离反动组织，并确实停止反革命活动，即可吸收入会。
