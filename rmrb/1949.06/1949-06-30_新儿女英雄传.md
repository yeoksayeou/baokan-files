  　Fifteenth Episode: Guidance (Continued)
    Three
    Niu Dashui and the representatives of Sun Family Village were resolving the land disputes among Zhang San, Li Si, and Wang Mazi – the internal issues of the farmers. When they saw people from Shen Family Village arriving, the cadres and representatives greeted them warmly, offered them seats, and started chatting and laughing happily. After a while, the representatives from Shen Family Village brought up the matter of reclaiming the forty mu of land. Upon hearing this, the representatives from Sun Family Village were shocked. After a brief silence, the representatives from Sun Family Village called Dashui into the next room for a whispered conversation. When they came out, they all looked a bit embarrassed; they let Dashui speak first.
    Dashui said with a smile to Xiaomei, "Oh, Comrade Yang Xiaomei, this matter is difficult to handle! Shen Family Village doesn't have a lot of land, does it? Why do you want to reclaim those forty mu of land?" Xiaomei was stunned at first, then said with a smile, "You're still saying that! Don't you know that Shen Family Village doesn't have enough land to cultivate?" Dashui said, "How could Shen Family Village not have enough land to cultivate?" Xiaomei said, "If there was enough land, would we be asking you for land?" The more they talked, the more twisted things became, and the smiles on their faces disappeared. The representatives on both sides were anxious listening from the side. Eventually, they couldn't bear it any longer and started arguing over each other's words.
    The representative from Shen Family Village said, "Anyway, this land belongs to Shen Family Village and should be cultivated by us!" The representative from Sun Family Village said, "This land has already been allocated to Sun Family Village, and we have priority!" The person from Shen Family Village said, "We've been cultivating it since before the incident; our priority is even earlier than yours!" The person from Sun Family Village said, "Your priority is useless! Without the rent reduction of 1938, where would your priority come from?" The person from Shen Family Village also said, "We represent the interests of the farmers of Shen Family Village! How can we explain this to the masses if you do this?" The person from Sun Family Village also said, "We represent the interests of Sun Family Village! How can we explain this to the masses if you do this?"...
    Over there, the representatives were arguing heatedly, while here, Dashui and Xiaomei were having a chaotic quarrel. Dashui said, "What's there to argue about! Isn't it obvious?" Xiaomei said, "It is obvious! What are you arguing with me about?" Dashui said angrily, "I'm not talking to you anymore! You're clearly being parochial, and you're still arguing with me!" Xiaomei also said angrily, "Let's not talk anymore! You yourself are being parochial, and you're blaming me instead!" Dashui pointed at Xiaomei and said, "Ha! I think you've become the tail of the masses!" Xiaomei pointed at Dashui and said, "Hmph! You're the very tip of the tail of the masses!"...
    And so, representatives argued with representatives, cadres argued with cadres, everyone was red-faced and shouting, making a great commotion. After a long time, Liu Xier's voice was hoarse from shouting, Wei Dameng was gasping for air, Niu Dashui's head was spinning from anger, and Yang Xiaomei's stomach was aching from anger; the Old Ancestor was exhausted, panting and wheezing, sitting on the side, staring blankly...
    Just then, Hei Laocai, the county committee member, came to inspect the work.

    Four
    People all said, "Good, good, Laocai is here! Let Laocai be the judge!" Dashui stated Dashui's reasons, Xiaomei stated Xiaomei's reasons; the representatives from Shen Family Village spoke of Shen Family Village's logic, the representatives from Sun Family Village spoke of Sun Family Village's logic; it was truly a case of each side having their own reasons, and the two sides started arguing again. Hei Laocai listened and laughed heartily, laughing so hard that everyone was stunned.
    Hei Laocai told them all to sit down, rest for a bit, clear their heads, and then asked them, "Have you asked Shen Yaozong to return the grain he extorted?" Xiaomei and her group stammered, "This... not yet!" Dashui and his group also muttered, "We've been busy with trivial matters and haven't had time yet!" Laocai asked again, "Have you figured out whether Shen Yaozong is concealing land?" At this question, both sides widened their eyes: "Oh... that's... who knows!" Laocai smiled and said, "You're arguing about land, but you don't even know how much land there is; what are you arguing about?" Everyone laughed sheepishly.
    Hei Laocai couldn't help but find it funny. He pressed further, asking, "Are you settling accounts with the landlord, or are you engaging in struggles between farmers?" Everyone lowered their heads in embarrassment, saying, "That's right! The mistake lies here!" The Old Ancestor slammed his cane and said, "Hey, Shen Yaozong has so much land! How come after all this fuss, there's not enough to cultivate?" People said, "Isn't it because he's been shuffling the land around, renting it to this one and then to that one, making a chaotic mess, making it impossible for us to figure out!" Liu Xier clapped his hands and said, "Gosh, we're hanging meat in our mouths, and our teeth are biting our tongues!"
    Wei Dameng jumped up and said, "That's bad! We've been tricked! Damn it, it's all my fault! I was the one who started this forty mu business, and I heard it from Shen Yaozong; aren't we being made monkeys of?" Everyone felt that they had truly been tricked. Xiaomei said with a red face, "It's all my fault, I shouldn't have eaten his food that day! He sweet-talked us, and we were completely confused!"
    Everyone thought about it, calculated it; Shen Yaozong had at least two *qing* of land, and he was hiding dozens of *mu*, surely intending to rent them out secretly and collect more rent. If these lands were rented out immediately, there would definitely be enough to cultivate; and if the extorted grain was returned, people would no longer go hungry!
    The representatives' hearts cleared, and everyone's face broke into a smile. The people from Shen Family Village apologized to the people from Sun Family Village, saying, "This was our fault, causing you trouble!" The people from Sun Family Village also apologized to the people from Shen Family Village, saying, "We were also wrong, arguing with you!" Xiaomei admitted her mistake to Dashui, saying that she hadn't stood firm on her position and that her work wasn't thorough enough. Dashui rushed to say, "I also made a mistake, I didn't investigate clearly, and my work wasn't thorough enough either; I left Shen Yaozong aside and instead argued with you, gosh, really, where did my position go!" Hei Laocai listened from the side, watching them with a smile, not saying a word.
    Just as everyone was talking animatedly, Wei Dameng suddenly shouted, "Okay, okay! We're all one family, what's with the politeness? Let's go find Shen Yaozong!" The people from Shen Family Village all said, "Let's go, let's go!" The people from Sun Family Village also said, "Let's go, let's go! Farmers all over the world are one family! Let's go together!"
    Dashui and Xiaomei asked Laocai if he had anything else to say. Laocai instructed, "It's good that you're going together, there's strength in numbers. But you must always pay attention: we have a side of struggle against landlords, and also a side of unity. Without struggle, without improving the people's lives, we cannot fundamentally defeat Japan; without unity, without a united front, we cannot unite more forces. Chairman Mao said that struggle is for unity, and unity is for resisting Japan. Let's not lean to the right, but let's not be too left either. Everyone, grasp this well!"
    The representatives said, "Right, right, right, let's go reason with Shen Yaozong!" With Dashui and Xiaomei leading the way, a group of people went off excitedly. The Old Ancestor, leaning on his cane, hurriedly followed behind.

    Five
    On the road, the representatives started chatting and laughing again. Dashui said to Xiaomei, "Ha, it's really lucky that Laocai came! If he hadn't come to inspect the work, who knows what kind of mess we would have made!" Xiaomei said with a smile, "Hmph! How fierce you were just now! Pointing at my nose, just labeling me! Anyway, I didn't have a move, whatever label you put on me, I put on you!"
    Dashui said amusedly, "Just now I was like having a mirror on my butt, seeing others but not seeing myself; I was really angry with you in my heart." Xiaomei said, "I wasn't angry to death either! I thought to myself, how can this person be so unreasonable, really a stubborn ox, I'll never be nice to him again." Saying this, she turned her face and smiled at Dashui. Dashui said, "Will you still be nice to me in the future?" Xiaomei's face flushed and she said, "Look at you, still asking that!"
    Both of them remembered that they were getting married soon, but instead they felt embarrassed, and felt it was inappropriate to walk side by side, so they separated and mingled among the representatives.
    The representatives were also chatting lively. The Old Ancestor said, "Look how capable our Hei Laocai is, how could he clear up my old muddled head with just a few words?" Wei Dameng shouted, "If it weren't for the Communist Party leading us, and Chairman Mao pointing the way for us, who knows where we would have died!"
    The more everyone talked, the happier they became, the more energetic they became. Liu Xier started singing a song about Chairman Mao, and everyone followed along, singing with varying degrees of accuracy:
    The East is Red,
    The sun rises,
    China has produced a Mao Zedong!
    He seeks survival for the people!
    Hu hai ya,
    He is the great savior of the people!

    (In yesterday's first section, last paragraph, Xiaomei bringing up the rent reduction decree one by one, asking Shen Yaozong to implement it, was mistakenly written as "asking Shen Yaozong to say: implement it." In the second section, last paragraph, going to Sun Family Village, was mistakenly written as "going to Shen Family Village." Corrections made.) (Attached picture)

    三
    牛大水和孙家庄的代表们，正在解决张三李四王麻子——农民内部的土地纠纷呢。一见申家庄那边人来了，干部和干部，代表和代表，都亲热的招呼、让坐，欢欢喜喜的说笑开了。谈了一阵闲话，申家庄的代表就提出来要收回那四十亩地的事儿，孙家庄的代表一听就直了眼儿。僵了一会，孙家庄的代表把大水叫到隔壁屋里，悄悄儿叽咕一阵，一个个走出来，脸上都不怎么好意思；他们让大水先开口。
    大水笑着对小梅说：“哈呀，杨小梅同志，你们这个事儿可不好办啊！申家庄的地不是很多吗？为什么要收回那四十亩地呢？”小梅先一楞，随后笑着说：“你还说这个话！申家庄的地不够种，你还不知道？”大水说：“申家庄的地怎么会不够种呢？”小梅说：“够种还问你们要地啊？”他两个越说越拧，脸上的笑影儿都没有了。两方面的代表在旁边听得着急，到后来再也耐不住，就你一言我一语的抢开话儿了。
    申家庄的代表说：“反正这地是申家庄的，应该归我们种！”孙家庄的代表说：“这地已经拨给孙家庄了，我们有优先权！”申家庄的说：“我们事变前就种上了，我们的优先权比你们还先！”孙家庄的说：“你们那个优先权不中用！没有三八年减租，哪儿来的优先权？”申家庄的又说：“我们代表申家庄农民的利益！你们这么着，叫我们跟群众怎么交代呀？”孙家庄的也说：“我们代表孙家庄的利益！你们这么着，叫我们跟群众怎么交代呀？”……
    那边代表跟代表争了个热闹，这边大水和小梅吵了个乱爆。大水说：“这有什么争的！不是明摆着的事儿啊？”小梅说：“就是明摆着的事儿么！你还跟我争什么呀？”大水生气的说：“我不跟你说了！明明你犯了本位，你还跟我吵！”小梅也生气的说：“咱们别说了！你自己犯了本位，倒还怪我！”大水指着小梅说：“唉！我看你是做了群众的尾巴啦！”小梅指着大水说：“吓！你才是群众的尾巴尖儿呢！”……
    这么着，代表对代表，干部对干部，大家脸红脖子粗，闹得不可开交。闹了半天，柳喜儿嚷得哑了嗓子，魏大猛叫得岔了气儿，牛大水火得脑袋懵，杨小梅气得肚子痛；老祖宗累坏了，上气不接不气的，坐在一边，干瞪着眼儿……
    正在这时候，县委黑老蔡检查工作来了。
    四
    人们都说：“好了好了，老蔡来了！叫老蔡评评理吧！”大水就说大水的理由，小梅就说小梅的理由；申家庄的代表讲申家庄的道理，孙家庄的代表讲孙家庄的道理；真是公说公有理，婆说婆有理，两方面又争开了。听得黑老蔡哈哈大笑，笑得大伙儿都楞住了。
    黑老蔡叫他们都坐下来，先歇一歇，清醒清醒脑子，然后问他们：“申耀宗倒算去的粮食，你们找他退了没有？”小梅那一伙吞吞吐吐的说：“这个……还没有呢！”大水那一伙也嘟嘟嚷嚷的说：“我们尽忙着鸡毛蒜皮的事儿，还没有顾上呢！”老蔡又问：“申耀宗有没有瞒地，你们弄清楚了没有？”这一问，两方面都瞪了眼儿：“啊呀……这可是……谁知道！”老蔡笑了笑说：“你们争地，连地有多少还不清楚，你们争什么呢？”大家都傻笑开了。
    黑老蔡也忍不住好笑，他紧一步问：“你们这是农民跟地主算帐呢，还是农民跟农民斗争呢？”大伙儿不好意思的搭拉下脑袋，说：“可不是！错就错在这上面啦！”老祖宗用拐杖一顿，说：“嗨，申耀宗的地多哩么！怎么七闹八闹就不够种了呢？”人们说：“还不是他把地倒来倒去，一会儿租给这个，一会儿租给那个，倒了个乱七八糟，弄得咱们摸不清啦！”柳喜儿拍着手说：“吓，咱们这是嘴头子上挂着肉，牙齿倒咬舌头！”
    魏大猛跳起来说：“坏了！这事儿咱们上当了！他妈的，都是我的过！要这四十亩地是我开的头，我可是听申耀宗说的；这不是给他耍猴儿啦？”大家都觉得，真是上当了。小梅红着脸说：“都怨我不好，那天就不该吃他的饭！人家把好话一糊弄，咱们就给迷混住啦！”
    大伙儿想一想，算一算，申耀宗顶少有两顷地呢，他隐瞒住好几十亩，准想暗地租出去，多收租子。要是把这些地马上租出来，就没个不够种的；再把刮走的粮食一退回，人们就不会再挨饿了啊！
    代表们心里一透亮，谁都笑开了脸儿。申家庄的就向孙家庄的道歉，说：“这是我们不对啦，找你们麻烦！”孙家庄的也向申家庄的赔礼，说：“我们也不好，跟你们吵嘴！”小梅对大水承认错误，说自己立场没站稳，工作不深入。大水抢着说：“我也有错误，我不追究明白，工作也是不深入；我把申耀宗撇在一边，倒跟你们闹，吓，真是，我的立场跑到哪儿去了啊！”旁边黑老蔡听着，笑迷迷的望着他们，不言声。
    大伙儿正说得热闹，魏大猛忽然喊起来：“得了得了！都是一家人，客气什么呀？咱们快找申耀宗去！”申家庄的都说：“走走走！”孙家庄的也说：“走走走！天下农民是一家！咱们一块儿去！”
    大水小梅问老蔡还有什么话，老蔡嘱咐说：“你们一块儿去很好，人多力量大。可是得随时注意：咱们对地主有斗争的一面，也有团结的一面。不斗争，不改善人民生活，就根本不能打败日本；不团结，不让统一战线，也不能团结更多的力量。毛主席说的，斗争是为了团结，团结是为了抗日。咱们不要右了，可也不要过左。大伙儿好好掌握住吧！”
    代表们说：“对对对，咱们跟申耀宗讲理去！”大水小梅领头，一伙人兴冲冲的走了，老祖宗拄着个拐杖，也急急忙忙的跟在后面。
    五
    路上，代表们又说笑开了。大水对小梅说：“哈，老蔡真来得巧！他要不来检查工作，咱们不定闹成什么样儿咧！”小梅笑着说：“吓！你那会儿凶成什么啦？指着我的鼻子，尽给我扣帽子！反正我也没有招儿，你给我扣什么帽子，我也给你扣什么帽子！”
    大水好笑的说：“那会儿我是屁股上挂镜子，照见别人照不见自己；心里可实在生你的气呢。”小梅说：“我还不是气得要命！心里说，这人怎么这样不讲理，真是个牛脾气，以后再不跟他好啦。”说着转过脸来，对大水笑了。大水说：“你以后还跟我好不？”小梅腾的一下脸红了，说：“看你还问这个话儿！”
    两个人都想起不久就要结婚了，反而不好意思起来，觉得并肩走着不合适，就分开，混在代表们中间去了。
    代表们也正说得热闹。老祖宗说：“瞧咱们黑老蔡真行啊，怎么三言五语，就把我这老糊涂点拨开了？”魏大猛嚷着：“要不是共产党领导咱们，毛主席给咱们指道儿，咱们还不定碰死在哪儿呢！”
    大家越说越高兴，越走越有劲儿了。柳喜儿唱起毛主席歌，大伙儿七高八低的跟着唱起来：
    东方红，
    太阳升，
    中国出了一个毛泽东！
    他为人民谋生存！
    呼嗨呀，
    他是人民大救星！
    （未完）
    （昨天第一节末一段，小梅把减租法令一条条提出来，叫申耀宗实行，误为“叫申耀宗说：实行。”第二节末一段，到孙家庄去，误为“到申家庄去。”特此更正）（附图片）
