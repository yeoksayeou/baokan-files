　　“Siberian Symphony”
    Li Qun
    The central theme of "Siberian Symphony" can be said to be the struggle between two artistic ideologies: the proletarian artistic ideology of serving workers, peasants, and soldiers, and the individualistic bourgeois artistic ideology of art for art's sake. The former is oriented towards the people, taking it as an honor for artists to perform and sing for the people. The latter is oriented towards Europe and America (in reality, fawning on the art of the European and American bourgeoisie), taking it as an honor for individuals to become so-called "celebrities" in the world (in reality, taking it as an honor to be approved as an artist by the bourgeoisie), while looking down on musicians who perform and sing for the working people, considering them "lower-class fiddlers" and "madmen"!
    The representative of the proletarian artistic ideology is the protagonist of the film, Red Army Captain Andrei Barasov. The representative of the bourgeois artistic ideology is the "musician" Boris. However, because our Andrei is on the right path, he finally becomes a great people's musician. And Boris, due to his lack of progress: a purely technical point of view, detached from the people; finally, along with the transformation of his comrades' artistic thoughts, he ends up as an isolated and lonely person. What a solemn lesson this is!
    Andrei was originally a top student at the Moscow State Conservatory of Music, but the artistic atmosphere in this school, the technical viewpoint, is very strong, and people simply worship students who have achievements in technology. Even Andrei is no exception. This shows that his artistic thinking at that time was not clear. Suddenly, the Soviet-German war began, and Andrei, in order to save the motherland, participated in the anti-fascist war, replacing music with weapons. During the breaks in the battle, he played the piano for everyone's entertainment. But when the war ended victoriously and he returned to his alma mater in Moscow, Andrei's left hand had lost consciousness due to injury and became "numb." At the music concert at his alma mater, when he saw Boris playing so skillfully, and his lover Natasha praised Boris so much, he immediately felt that he "would never be able to play as before" and was very painful. So he "made up his mind to go far away, away from everything in the world, away from music..."
    After that, he accidentally became involved with music again on the ship. This accidental event is meaningful for his future development. It shows the Soviet people's demand for music and artistic taste, and also shows the Soviet people's love for art and its geniuses. When he went to work at the Kulba construction site in Siberia, one Saturday evening, his colleagues at the construction company held an entertainment party in the workers' teahouse. Andrei entertained everyone by playing the accordion. He played and sang, and was warmly welcomed by his colleagues. But he suddenly thought of the scene at the music concert in Moscow, and became painful. He suddenly left the venue and ran back to his bedroom. Everyone didn't know what was going on, and the shopkeeper came to him and said, "Everyone is asking you, can you play something else?" Andrei said, "I don't want to play anymore, I don't want to play anymore! Is this music? Is this the music I dreamed of when I was studying?" From this conversation, we can see that Andrei still did not deeply realize the significance of his playing and singing for the workers at the entertainment party. But at this time, the masses proposed to him: "Why did you abandon us? Without you, we are like children without mothers!" So, thanks to the power of the masses, Andrei was finally invited out. From then on, he began to become a true people's musician. The people educated him, cultivated him, supported him, gave him strength, and gradually clarified and strengthened him ideologically, and he was willingly honored to serve the great people in the small Kulba teahouse with music.
    However, the students who had lived in Moscow schools for a long time could not understand the great significance of Andrei's work. When his lover Natasha had to go to the United States to participate in an international music competition, the plane was forced to land at the airport of the Kulba construction site due to fog, so she had the opportunity to meet Andrei. Andrei said to her: "Natasha! You only see the teahouse here, but I see the people—our simple Russian people. It is they, this group of workers, peasants, and young people, who defended Moscow in difficult times and defeated the enemy near Stalingrad. During the years of the war, I suddenly became very close to them,... they helped me so much, they made me believe that I could still become a musician. ...So after work, I come to play for them and sing a few self-composed ancient songs. In this way, I feel very happy. They come here like a festival to ask for my music, my songs. You will see all this with your own eyes!"
    Indeed, Natasha quickly saw all this, and soon after, she understood the great significance of Andrei's work, and even she was willing to stay in Siberia and "did not want to go to America." Is this entirely the power of love? No, this is mainly the power of the people. Whoever has the people in their eyes, whoever can sincerely love the people, will progress. This should be a truth!
    The people cultivated Andrei, which is an important factor in Andrei's success. However, Andrei himself is also a great typical Soviet people. He is creative, brave, calm, resolute, and has a high degree of love for the motherland and the people. He is like an embodiment of a petrel, traveling all over Siberia, exerting his subjective efforts to the extreme in the cold wind and heavy snow of Siberia, inspired by the Siberian people's construction of new cities and new villages from the wilderness, inspired by the people's labor enthusiasm and the people's music, and finally completed the great Soviet people's patriotic labor poem—"Siberian Symphony". Received warm praise from the people.
    As for Boris, the representative of bourgeois artistic thought, he expresses art for art's sake in artistic issues, and individualism and selfishness in life issues. Because of his proficiency in music technology, people cheer for him without principle. This makes Boris even more arrogant and conceited. However, such a situation does not last long, nor is it universal. Because of the victory of the party's artistic thought through the specific figure of Andrei, Boris's "art" lost its market. Even Natasha, who had loved him and praised his music, but later awakened, answered him like this: "I have met people I have never met before, who are working hard for the motherland and the people all over the country. ...You don't seem to be that kind of person, you live for yourself, you only love your own art, you only love yourself..." So Natasha abandoned him like that, and Boris became an isolated person.
    In the end, our Andrei succeeded and triumphed. This is the victory of the high ideological principles of proletarian art, and the victory of the socialist culture led by the great Lenin and Stalin Party.

　　“西伯利亚交响曲”
    力群
    “西伯利亚交响曲”的中心主题，可说是两种艺术思想的斗争，一种是为工农兵服务的无产阶级的艺术思想，一种是个人主义的为艺术而艺术的资产阶级的艺术思想。前者是面向人民，以给人民演奏歌唱被人民称为艺术家为光荣。后者是面向欧美（实际是向欧美资产阶级的艺术阿谀），以个人成为世界的所谓“名人”为光荣（实际是以资产阶级批准他是艺术家为光荣），而对于为劳动人民演奏和歌唱的音乐家却看不起，认为是“下等的拉琴的”，认为是“疯子”！
    作为无产阶级艺术思想代表的，是影片的主人翁红军上尉安德雷巴拉索夫。作为资产阶级艺术思想代表的是“音乐家”波利斯。然而我们的安德雷由于他所走的道路是正确的，他终于成为伟大的人民的音乐家了。而波利斯则由于自己的毫不长进：单纯的技术观点，脱离人民；终于伴随着伙伴们的艺术思想的转变，使他落得无人亲近寡人一名。这是何等严正的教训啊！
    安德雷原是莫斯科国立音乐院的高材生，可是在这个学校里的艺术空气，技术观点是很浓厚的，人们单纯地崇拜着在技术上有成就的同学。连安德雷也毫不例外。这说明他当时的艺术思想是并不明确的。突然，苏德战争开始了，安得雷为了拯救祖国，参加反法西斯战争，以武器代替了音乐。在战斗的间隙他弹着琴为大家娱乐。可是当战争胜利结束，他再回到莫斯科母校时，安德雷的左手已经因受伤而失掉知觉成为“麻木”的了。在母校的音乐演奏会上当他看到波利斯弹的那样成熟，他的爱人娜塔莎对波利斯那么赞扬，他即感到自己“永远不能再象以往那样会弹”而十分痛苦。于是便“独自打定主意，要向远走，远离世上的一切，离开音乐……”
    这之后，他在船上偶然和音乐又发生了关系。这个偶然事件对于他今后的发展是有意义的，这里表明了苏联人民对音乐的要求和艺术口味，同时也表明了苏联人民对艺术及其天才的爱好。当他到了西伯利亚的库尔巴建筑场工作时，一个星期六的晚上，建筑公司的同事们在工人茶馆里开娱乐晚会。安德雷给大家拉手风琴助兴。他边拉边唱，受到同事们的热烈欢迎。但他忽然想到在莫斯科音乐演奏会上的情形，就痛苦起来，他突然离开会场，跑回自己的卧室。大家都不知道是怎么一回事，店主来找他说：“大家要求你，可否再来一段什么别的？”安德雷说：“我不愿再玩了，我不愿再拉了！难道这是音乐吗？是我学习时所梦想的音乐吗？”从这段对话里我们看出安德雷直到这时还没有深刻地认识到他在娱乐晚会上为工人拉唱的意义。可是这时群众向他提出：“你为什么丢掉了我们？离开你我们就象没有娘的孩子！”于是由于群众的力量终于把安德雷请出来了。从此之后他才开始成为真正的人民的音乐家。人民教育了他，培养了他，支持了他，给与他力量，使他从思想上逐渐明确起来，坚定下来，安心情愿的以音乐为小小的库尔巴茶馆里的伟大的人民服务为光荣。
    但长期住在莫斯科学校里的同学们，就不能理解安德雷所作的工作的伟大意义。当他的爱人娜塔莎因为要到美国去参加国际音乐竞赛，飞机遇雾被迫降落到库尔巴建筑处的机场，因而有缘和安德雷见了面，安德雷对她说：“娜塔莎！你仅看见这里的茶社，而我却望见了人民——我们朴素的俄罗斯的人民。就是他们这帮工农和青年人，在困难时日中保卫了莫斯科，战胜了斯大林格勒附近的敌人。在战争几年间，我忽然跟他们很亲近，……他们是怎样帮助了我，他们使我相信：我自己还能够成为一个音乐家。………于是我在工作闲暇之后，来为他们演奏，为他们唱出几首自编的古歌。这样一来，我便觉得心里非常痛快。他们来此地象过节日一样要求我的音乐，我的歌曲。你会亲眼看见这一切的！”
    的确娜塔莎很快就看见这一切，不久之后，她就了解了安德雷的工作的伟大意义，甚至她也愿意留在西伯利亚，“不愿意上那个美国去”了。难道这全然是爱情的力量吗？不是的，这主要是人民的力量，谁眼睛里有人民，谁能真诚地热爱人民，谁就会进步，这应该是一个真理吧！
    人民培养了安德雷，这是安德雷成功的重要因素。然而安德雷本人也正是一个伟大的典型的苏联人民。他富有创造力，勇敢，沉着，坚毅，有着高度的对于祖国和人民的爱。他象一只海燕的化身，走遍了西伯利亚，在西伯利亚的寒风大雪中极尽了主观的努力，受了西伯利亚人民从荒野里建设新城市新农村的感召，受了人民劳动热情和人民音乐的启示，终于完成了伟大的苏联人民爱国主义劳动者之诗歌—“西伯利亚交响曲”。受到了人民热烈的赞扬。
    至于作为资产阶级艺术思想代表的波利斯，表现在艺术问题上是为艺术而艺术，表现在人生问题上是个人主义自私自利。由于他在音乐技术上的熟练，人们都无原则的给他喝采。因而这就更加使得波利斯傲慢、目空一切。然而这样的局面并不长久，也不普遍，由于党的艺术思想通过安德雷这个具体人物的胜利，使波利斯的“艺术”消失了市场。就是曾经爱过他，赞美过他的音乐，而后来觉悟起来的娜塔莎也回答他这样的话：“我遇到过以前未曾遇见过的人，他们在祖国各地为祖国、为人民辛勤的工作着。……你好象不是那样的人，你为个人而生活，只爱自己的艺术，只爱自己……”于是就这样的娜塔莎抛弃了他，波利斯成为寡人一名。
    最后我们的安德雷成功了，胜利了。这是无产阶级艺术的高度思想原则的胜利，这是伟大列宁斯大林党所领导的社会主义文化的胜利。
