Jizhong Electric: The state-run Baoding Yusheng Store is helping farmers produce by selling them fertilizer at low prices and helping them sell their agricultural products. Since the widespread rain in late last month, farmers have been rushing to plant, requiring large quantities of fertilizer, and have been transporting cotton, wheat, coarse grains, and other products from the surrounding villages to the city to exchange for fertilizer. As a result, fertilizer sales in the market have been rapid, and speculators have taken the opportunity to raise prices. Bean cake and cottonseed cake, which cost 25 yuan per catty before the rain, rose to 32 yuan per catty after the rain on May 27th. The price of sesame cake fluctuated sharply, causing great losses to farmers. After discovering this situation, Yusheng immediately used all of its 80,000 catties of stored cottonseed to extract oil and sold the cottonseed cake on the market at a low price (the market price was 32 yuan per catty, while the store sold it for 30 yuan), and helped sell agricultural products through its business, providing great convenience to the farmers in the surrounding villages. For example, Guo Lao Xin, a farmer from Guo Village in Mancheng, exchanged wheat for fertilizer in Baoding on behalf of the farmers' mutual aid group. The store helped him sell more than 1,200 catties of wheat and buy 2,351 catties of cottonseed cake. According to statistics for June 1st alone, the Yusheng Store sold more than 9,800 catties of cottonseed cake.

### 保定国营裕生商店　扶助农民生产低价售肥

　　保定国营裕生商店
  　扶助农民生产低价售肥
    【冀中电】国营保定裕生商店，低价卖给农民肥料，帮助推销农产品，扶植农业生产。自上月下旬普遍落雨后，农民抢种，需要大批肥料，纷纷由四周乡村运来棉花、小麦、粗粮等产品到城市换取肥料。因此市场肥料销售很快，投机商人趁机抬高物价，豆饼、棉籽饼雨前每斤二十五元，五月二十七日落雨后就涨到了三十二元，麻饼价格则忽涨忽落，农民吃亏很大。裕生发现此种情况后，立即将所存棉籽八万斤，全部榨油，把棉籽饼拿到市场低价出售（市价每斤三十二元，该店卖价三十元），并通过业务帮助销售农产品，给四乡农民以很大方便。如满城郭村农民郭老新，代替农民互助组到保定以小麦换回肥料，商店给他代卖小麦一千二百余斤，买棉籽饼二千三百五十一斤。据六月一日一天统计，裕生商店就出售棉籽饼九千八百余斤。
