　　Assisting Gold and Silver Businesses to Transition
　　Tangshan People's Bank Convenes Meeting with Gold Shops
    [Report from this newspaper] The Tangshan People's Bank and the Commercial Bureau, in order to assist gold and silver jewelry businesses in Tangshan City to transition, convened a meeting with representatives from various gold shops in the city's Chamber of Commerce on the 14th. They explained the government's financial policies in detail, stating that the gold and silver business no longer meets the needs of society today and will inevitably be eliminated in the future. The government is supporting and developing industrial and commercial enterprises that are beneficial to the national economy and the people's livelihoods, advising them to quickly shift to legitimate production businesses to avoid waiting for capital losses. They also cited the fact that some gold shops that had been approved for transition did not truthfully report their gold and silver holdings to the People's Bank for exchange. To assist in the transition, preferential exchange rates were specified, requiring applications for re-exchange with the People's Bank within three days from the 15th to the 17th, after which preferential treatment would no longer be granted. The quality of gold and silver will be assessed by an appraisal committee jointly formed by the People's Bank and the Commercial Trade Association. After the meeting, gold shops that had not yet transitioned registered for transition one after another.

　　协助金银业转业
  　唐山人民银行召集各金店开会
    【本报讯】唐山人民银行、商业局为协助唐市金银首饰业转业，曾于十四日在市商会召集各金店代表举行会议，详细阐述政府金融政策，说明今天金银业已不合社会需要，将来一定会被淘汰，政府所扶植发展的是有利于国计民生的工商业，劝其从速转向正当生产事业，免致坐待资金亏损。并举出已批准转业的金店不据实将所存金银向人民银行呈报兑换的事实。为了协助转业，特规定优待兑换牌价，规定在十五日至十七日三天内向人民银行重新申请兑换，过时则不予优待。金银成色当由人民银行及商业同业公会会商组成评议会评定。会后各未转业金店，均纷纷登记转业。
