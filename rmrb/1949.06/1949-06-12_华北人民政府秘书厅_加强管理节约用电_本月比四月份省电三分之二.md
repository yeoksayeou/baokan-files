  　Strengthens Management and Conserves Electricity
    This Month's Savings are Two-Thirds More Than April
    [This Newspaper's Report] All staff in the Secretariat of the North China People's Government, residing in the former Bankers' Association building, have strengthened the management of light switches and conserved electricity, with positive results. Over one hundred people from the Secretariat work there. In April, due to a lack of management, some lights were left on all night, resulting in an average daily consumption of 76 kilowatt-hours (degrees). In May, all staff responded to Chairman Dong Biwu's call and began to pay attention to conservation, with an average daily consumption of 48 kilowatt-hours, a reduction of 28 kilowatt-hours compared to the previous month. This month, the office has formulated specific conservation measures. First, designated personnel are responsible for switching lights on and off, removing one bulb from double-bulb fixtures, eliminating all unnecessary lights, and replacing large bulbs with smaller ones where it does not hinder work. According to the electricity meter reading on the 10th of this month, the daily consumption was only 23 kilowatt-hours, 25 kilowatt-hours less than May and 53 kilowatt-hours less than April.
    Another report: Based on the conservation materials from various departments, the North China People's Government will publish a small, irregular publication called "Conservation Newsletter" to guide conservation efforts and exchange experiences.

  　加强管理节约用电
    本月比四月份省电三分之二
    【本报讯】华北人民政府秘书厅住前银行公会部份全体员工加强管理电灯开关，节省用电，已有成绩。该处共有秘书厅一百余人办公，四月份用电因未加管理，有些灯甚至通夜不关，平均每日耗电七十六度。五月份全体员工响应董必武主席号召，开始注意节约，平均每日用电四十八度，已较上月份减少二十八度。本月份该处又订出具体节约办法，首先指定专人负责开关电灯，把双灯泡摘掉一个，没用的灯全部取消，并在不妨碍工作的条件之下把大灯泡换成小灯泡，据本月十日检查电表结果，当日仅用电二十三度，比五月份少用电二十五度。比四月份少用电五十三度。
    又讯：华北人民政府根据各部门节约材料，将出版“节约通讯”小型不定期刊，以指导节约，交流经验。
