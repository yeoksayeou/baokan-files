　　German Socialist Unity Party Issues Statement on Paris Agreement
  　Praising the Success of Soviet Peace Policy
    Emphasizing the Victory of the Chinese People as a Factor
    [Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 26th] Agence France-Presse, Berlin: On the 21st, the German Socialist Unity Party issued a statement on the results of the Foreign Ministers Conference, declaring: "The responsibility for the failure of the four foreign ministers to reach an agreement on the reunification of Germany rests entirely with the three Western foreign ministers." The statement strongly stated: "Despite all provocations, the conference did not break down. This is a success of the firm peace policy pursued by the Soviet Union." In further analyzing other factors for the conference's attainment of some agreements, the statement emphasized: "The victory of the democratic forces of the Chinese people has given the imperialist politicians something to consider." The statement also pointed out that these factors also included: "The growing resistance of the people of Western countries to the US's peddling of war policies," and "the threatening signs of the economic crisis occurring in the United States and Marshallized countries."
