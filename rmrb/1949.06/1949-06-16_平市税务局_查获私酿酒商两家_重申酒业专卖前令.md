　　Discovers Two Illicit Distillers
　　Reaffirms Previous Order on Alcohol Monopoly
　　[Ping City News] Since the implementation of the alcohol monopoly in this city, the average daily sales volume of alcohol has only reached ten thousand catties, which is far from the actual consumption. According to the City Tax Bureau, the reasons for this are no more than the following four: (1) Illegal merchants are privately brewing alcohol, and cases have been investigated and solved, such as Chen Desheng Distillery in Taipingqiao and Tan Yizhi in Yangmao Hutong. (2) There are a large number of old stocks of liquor. (3) Liquor merchants are adulterating alcohol with water to pass off as liquor for sale. (4) Illicit liquor from outside the city continues to enter the market. In order to implement the alcohol monopoly and protect the legitimate profits of merchants, the bureau hereby reiterates the following points for all merchants and people to abide by:
　　1. If private brewers are discovered, in addition to confiscating all their stock of alcohol and brewing equipment and recovering previous tax payments, they will be sent to the court for strict investigation.
　　2. Adulterating alcohol with water to pass off as liquor for sale not only evades national taxes but also harms the people's health. If discovered, in addition to confiscation, severe penalties will be imposed.
　　3. Except for the North China Alcohol Monopoly Company, no private individual may transport alcohol into the city. If discovered, alcohol with complete procedures will be purchased at a reduced price, and alcohol without complete procedures will be treated as illicit alcohol.
　　4. Liquor merchants' old stocks of liquor will be registered by the tax sub-bureaus starting from the 15th of this month. The registration forms will be printed by the Tax Bureau. Those who refuse to register or make false registrations will be subject to confiscation of all concealed alcohol and a considerable fine (registration will not result in confiscation or further taxation).
　　5. Liquor merchants may not sell monopoly alcohol without permission. The application period for retail liquor vendors in this city ended at the end of last month. If there are any who wish to apply, the sub-bureaus may issue temporary liquor sales licenses at their discretion.
　　6. Anyone may report private brewing, smuggling, private sale, private storage, or the use of alcohol to make liquor. After investigation and handling, a reward of 30% of the confiscated amount will be given.
