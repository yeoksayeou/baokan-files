　　【Our Newspaper News】Yesterday (the 6th) was the 150th anniversary of the birth of the famous Russian poet Pushkin. The literary and art circles of Beiping held a commemorative meeting at the Jianguo East Church. More than 700 people attended. Mr. Guo Moruo delivered the opening speech, explaining that Pushkin was great because he stood on the side of the people under the tyranny of the Russian Tsar more than a hundred years ago, regarded the people as his friends, and wrote in the language of the people, which is worthy of our literary and art circles to learn from. Today, grand commemorative meetings are being held throughout the Soviet Union, proving that the Soviet Union, under the spirit of internationalism, highly respects the people's old culture and national culture. This gives a powerful answer to all slanders against the Soviet Union. Then Comrade Lin Zuhan spoke, emphasizing that the main significance of commemorating Pushkin today lies in the fact that Chinese literary and art workers should learn from this great Russian poet to love the people, serve the people, integrate with the workers and peasants, transform and improve themselves, and cultivate a large number of worker-peasant intellectuals to undertake the task of cultural and educational construction of the new China. Subsequently, Comrade Ge Baoquan reported on Pushkin's life, Ke Zhongping and Feng Zi recited commemorative poems, Bai Yang and Shu Xiuwen recited Pushkin's works, and finally a Lermontov film was shown.

　　平文艺界昨集会　纪念普希金诞辰
    【本报讯】昨（六）日为俄罗斯著名诗人普希金一百五十周年诞辰，北平市文艺界特在建国东堂举行纪念大会。到会七百余人。郭沫若先生致开会词，说明普希金所以伟大，是因为他在一百多年前，在俄国沙皇的暴政下，就站在人民方面，把人民做为自己的朋友，用人民的语言来写作，是值得我们文艺界学习的。今天在苏联各地举行着盛大的纪念会，证明苏联在国际主义的精神下是十分尊重人民旧有的文化，民族文化的。这给予一切对苏联的诽谤以有力的回答。继由林祖涵同志讲话，他强调说今天纪念普希金的主要意义在乎中国的文艺工作者应向这位俄国伟大诗人学习热爱人民，为人民服务，和工农群众结合，改造并提高自己，并培养大量的工农知识分子，担负起新中国的文教建设任务。随后由戈宝权同志报告普希金生平，柯仲平及凤子朗诵纪念诗，白杨、舒绣文朗诵普希金的作品，最后放映莱蒙托夫影片。
