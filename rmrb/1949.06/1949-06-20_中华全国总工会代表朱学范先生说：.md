Mr. Zhu Xuefan, representative of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, said:
　　The preparation and convening of this new CPPCC meeting, on the one hand, declares the demise of the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang, and on the other hand, declares the imminent establishment of a new people's democratic regime. From now on, China can embark on the road of independence, democracy, peace, and unity. The world has also added a new democratic country with a population of 475 million, strengthening the world's democratic forces led by the Soviet Union. Therefore, the convening of the new CPPCC is not only a great joyous event for the Chinese people, but also a major event worthy of celebration by the people of the world.
　　The Chinese Communist Party led the Chinese people in defeating the feudal forces of thousands of years in China, the imperialist aggressor forces of the past hundred years, and the bureaucratic capital and evil Kuomintang ruling forces of the past few decades. The fact that the CCP and other democratic parties and the entire people send representatives in equal proportions to participate in the preparatory work for the new CPPCC meeting fully demonstrates democracy and the greatness of the CCP and Chairman Mao.
　　At the same time, the Chinese working class is participating in the management of the regime for the first time in history. This is because they have turned over and become masters of the country under the leadership of the CCP and Chairman Mao. Under the people's regime, the Chinese working class must always unite under the victorious banner of the CCP and Chairman Mao, and strive to complete the great historical task of restoring and developing production, and also carry forward the organizational strength of the working class as a powerful pillar of the new regime.

　　中华全国总工会代表朱学范先生说：
    这次新政协会议的筹备召开，一面是宣告了国民党反动统治的灭亡，一面宣示人民民主新政权的即将建立，中国从此可以走上独立、民主、和平、统一的道路。世界上也增加了一个拥有四万万七千五百万人口的新民主主义国家，增强了以苏联为首的世界的民主力量，因此，新政协的召开，不仅是中国人民的大喜事，也是世界人民值得庆贺的大事。
    中国共产党领导中国人民，击溃了中国几千年来的封建势力，一百年来的帝国主义侵略势力和几十年来的官僚资本和万恶的国民党统治势力，而中共与其他民主党派人民全体以同等比例数派出代表，参加新政协会议的筹备工作，这是充分表现了民主和中共与毛主席的伟大。
    同时中国工人阶级在历史上是第一次参加管理政权，这是在中共与毛主席的领导下翻了身做了国家的主人才有这样的地位。中国工人阶级在人民政权下，要永远团结在中共与毛主席胜利的旗帜下，努力完成恢复与发展生产的伟大历史任务，而且还要发扬工人阶级的组织力量，作为新政权有力的支柱。
