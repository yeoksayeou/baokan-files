Germany's Currency Problems
      Ding Ming

　　I. The US, Britain and France Deliberately Split Germany
    The German currency issue was also on the agenda of the Four Foreign Ministers' Conference on the 23rd of last month. The reason why the German currency became a problem is entirely due to the unilateral implementation of "currency reform" by the US, British and French authorities on June 18 last year, in violation of the Potsdam Agreement.
    The Soviet Union has consistently advocated that German currency reform should be implemented jointly throughout Germany with the consent of the four powers. As late as the day before the promulgation of the West German "currency reform" decree, Marshal Sokolovsky, the head of the Soviet military government, said that the Soviet occupation authorities were prepared to support the German currency reform agreed upon by the four countries. However, the US, British, and French authorities, who were intent on splitting Germany, did not agree with the Soviet proposal. They continued to implement their consistent policy of division—a separate "currency reform," attempting to undermine the economy of the Soviet-occupied zone of Germany and splitting Berlin's economy.
    However, the division of Berlin is only one part of the overall policy of the Western countries to dismember Germany. Since January 1, 1947, the US-British aggressive bloc has taken a series of measures to split Germany, such as the merger of the US and British occupied zones, Law No. 56 on the retention of cartels, the agreement between the US, Britain, and France on the export and distribution of Ruhr coal, the US-British decision to reorganize the administrative institutions of the joint occupation zone, establish the Supreme Court of the joint occupation zone, and establish the German State Bank. From February to June 1948, the foreign ministers of the US, Britain, and France held separate meetings in London on German issues. The decisions adopted at the meeting stipulated the completion of the division and dismemberment of Germany, the undermining of the conclusion of a peace treaty with Germany, the subordination of the German economy to the purposes of the US and Britain, and the dominance of US and British monopoly capital in the Ruhr industry. The "currency reform" in West Germany was the first divisive action after the London Conference.
    This separate "currency reform" has long been carefully planned and is bound to be implemented by the Western authorities. The preparatory work began long before the London Foreign Ministers' Conference in 1947. The fact that the paper used to wrap the new Mark was stamped with the mark "Washington, November 16, 1947" is proof of this.
    Now, as a result of West Germany's "currency reform," Germany has economically isolated West Germany from East Germany, effectively turning West Germany into a country dominated by US and British monopoly capital—which is exactly the goal the London Conference wanted to achieve.
    As pointed out earlier, the new currency in West Germany was printed in Washington and can be printed as much as needed according to the needs of the US authorities. Its printing is not subject to the supervision and control of German representatives; moreover, it cannot be used as a means of payment between the East and West occupied zones, nor can it be used as a means of external payment. On the day the "currency reform" decree was announced, the financial advisor to the British Military Governor Robertson publicly announced at a press conference: "Only the US dollar can be used as a means of payment for trade between the East and West zones and for foreign trade." Therefore, the new currency in West Germany does not resemble a real German currency at all; it is merely US military scrip. A dispatch from the German News Agency in Frankfurt stated that the Western occupation zone issued 7.5 billion new Marks, most of which were retained by the occupation authorities for their own use. They controlled the printing and distribution of the "German Mark," thus obtaining a rich source of income.

　　II. "Currency Reform" Causes Suffering to the Working People
    This "currency reform" in West Germany has caused great sacrifices to the working people, while allowing American capitalists and capitalists and speculators associated with them to make a fortune through currency reform.
    According to the currency reform decree, German workers can only exchange 40 Marks per month at a ratio of one-to-one, and can only receive another 20 Marks at the end of the month. According to the prices at the time of the currency reform, according to the Finance Minister of Baden-Württemberg, this is only enough for one person to maintain the minimum standard of living for eight days. The suffering of the workers can be imagined. On the other hand, the currency reform decree stipulates that entrepreneurs can be provided with large amounts of funds, so bankers and industrialists do not actually need to use their funds. Moreover, the decree does not have a way to deal with the ill-gotten gains seized by black market profiteers, so they can take advantage of the currency reform to make profits.
    Not only that, but along with the currency reform came the monopoly capitalists' sharp increase in prices, which caused the people's living standards to decline even more sharply. According to the British military government's newspaper Die Welt on August 17 last year, after the currency reform, coal prices have risen by 117 percent, which means the soaring prices of gas, electricity, steel, building materials, and fertilizers. The prices of non-ferrous metals have also risen sharply. Moreover, due to the stipulation that the exchange rate between the Mark and the US dollar is one Mark to three US dollars, the import raw material prices of the textile and leather industries have increased two to three times. For example, raw cotton has risen from one Mark and twenty pfennigs per kilogram (a unit below the Mark, one hundred pfennigs equals one Mark) to three Marks and twenty pfennigs. Last September, the Allied Occupation Administration Committee announced a further price increase from October 1. Gas has increased to 46 pfennigs per cubic foot, electricity has risen by 3 pfennigs per kilowatt by the end of January, beef has risen by 26 percent per pound, pork by 36 percent, and white bread, which originally sold for 45 pfennigs per kilogram, now costs 54 pfennigs.
    According to estimates by the Planning and Statistics Bureau of Lower Saxony (in Hanover), after the price increase, a family of four needs at least 243 Marks to barely make a living. But in the US occupied zone, the food ration for a family with three children alone costs (in July last year) 228 Marks, while a worker in a metal industry can only earn 192 Marks per month. Other workers earn even less, and their living standards are even worse. Therefore, the living conditions of workers after the currency reform are very miserable.
    The decrease in purchasing power is certainly one of the reasons for the decline in workers' living standards, and the increase in unemployment has made their lives even worse. After the currency reform, news immediately came that small businesses in Munich were laying off employees, and several companies in Hamburg immediately went bankrupt, and civil servants were immediately dismissed, etc., and so on. Today, there are about two million unemployed people in the western occupied zones. The increase in unemployment is also one of the main reasons for the currency reform.
    Contrary to the shortage of chips at the beginning of the currency reform, Germany has created inflation due to the Western occupation authorities' indiscriminate issuance of banknotes. By mid-December last year, according to the Americans, the amount of new Marks in circulation had almost doubled (14 billion). However, according to the German News Agency, no one knows how many new Marks printed in Washington have not been handed over to the German State Bank and have directly entered circulation. Moreover, since the US dollar is the only means of payment, American banks are taking "German Marks" at a rate of seven to eight US cents to one Mark, while the official price is three US dollars to one Mark. Inflation is another new trick by the US and Britain to carry out financial plunder of the people of West Germany.
    However, the economic aggression of the US and British authorities against the German people does not stop there. On March 21 this year, they also prohibited the circulation of the German Mark issued by the German issuing bank in the Soviet occupied zone in West Berlin. This reactionary measure has caused great damage to the people in the western districts of Berlin, because many people living in the western districts work in the eastern districts, and some people living in the eastern districts work in the western districts. This measure discriminated against residents living in the western district who worked and obtained rations in the eastern district, and caused residents in the western district to lose some money—only 15 Marks per deposit can be exchanged, and current accounts and deposits are no longer converted. The German News Agency pointed out that this measure by the Western countries is a "political plunder of the currency held by the people," which is not wrong at all.

　　III. The Soviet Military Government is Forced to Take Countermeasures
    Due to the separate "currency reform" implemented by the West, in order to prevent the Soviet occupied zone and the Greater Berlin area from suffering the unfortunate effects of the West German currency reform and to ensure the normal development of economic life, the Soviet military government had no choice but to implement another currency reform on June 21 last year. However, in contrast to the West German currency reform, the Soviet military government's currency reform was "for the benefit of the working people, social justice, and the quickest possible restoration and development of Germany's peacetime economy."
    In order to protect the cash income of the working people, the reform decree clearly stipulated that it was permissible to exchange 70 Marks at a rate of one-to-one. Moreover, the interests of the working people and small depositors were also respected. Deposits below 100 Marks were allowed to be converted at a rate of one-to-one, and those within 1,000 Marks were converted at a rate of five-to-one. Moreover, credit loans obtained by farmers after the land reform were allowed to be exchanged at a rate of five-to-one.
    In order to confiscate the funds of wartime speculators, profiteers, nouveaux riches, and black market merchants, it was stipulated that when bank deposits exceeded 5,000 Marks, or when each household exchanged more than 5,000 Marks, the source of the deposit must be investigated, and exchange was only permitted if the deposit was deemed legal. However, the capital of people's enterprises was exchanged at a favorable ratio.
    Therefore, the currency reform in the Soviet occupied zone consolidated the German monetary system, created favorable conditions for economic development, and improved the people's living standards. As a result, since the currency reform, a total of 4.112 billion German Marks have been issued in the entire zone, and no more has been issued since then. The total amount of currency in circulation has always remained at 4.112 billion. Moreover, due to the implementation of various economic measures, the purchasing power of the new Mark (German Mark) has greatly increased, and the people's lives have been improving day by day.
    For example, after the currency reform, when beef sold for one Mark and forty-two pfennigs per pound in the western occupied zones in January, it only cost 80 pfennigs in the Soviet occupied zone, and white bread only cost 34 pfennigs per pound, while it cost 54 pfennigs in the western occupied zones. Moreover, the wages of workers in the Soviet occupied zone were also higher than those in the western occupied zones. The wages of highly skilled workers were one Mark and forty-four pfennigs per hour, while the highest in the western occupied zones was only one Mark and twelve pfennigs.

　　IV. The US, British, and French Governments Fail to Fulfill the Moscow and Paris Agreements
    Later, at the request of the US, British, and French governments, the negotiations held by their representatives in Moscow had already reached an agreement to resolve the currency issue, stipulating that the Soviet occupied zone Mark would be the only currency in Berlin, and that the circulation of "B" marked Marks in Berlin would be stopped; it was stipulated that the Berlin single currency circulation regulations would be implemented by the Soviet occupied zone issuing bank through the existing credit institutions in Berlin, and that a financial committee composed of representatives of the four-power governors would be established to supervise the various measures for the circulation of the Berlin single currency. A communiqué was issued on August 30 last year. The US, British, and French governments, however, went back on their word on this agreement signed by their representatives and rejected it, so that it could not be implemented. Similar agreements were still reached in the informal negotiations in Paris last October, but this agreement did not escape the same fate as the previous agreement. Not only that, but the US, British, and French authorities have intensified their efforts and further ordered the cessation of the circulation of the Soviet occupied zone Mark in West Berlin on March 21 this year. Therefore, the separate currency reform system that gave rise to the Berlin problem has not been resolved. This proves that the Western authorities are consciously, artificially, and arbitrarily creating the "Berlin problem." Its purpose is to divert the attention of the German people from the divisive measures in the western occupied zones and to cover up the activities of the Western countries in turning West Germany into a military strategic base and consolidating the starting point of American imperialism's position in Europe.
    All these clearly show the different aims and policies of the US, Britain, and France and the Soviet Union. The policy of division and dismemberment of Germany by the three Western powers is aimed at enslaving the people of West Germany and using their economic power to achieve the aggressive aims of imperialism. As for the Soviet policy, it is to defend peace and democracy, abide by the Yalta and Potsdam agreements, and assist Germany in becoming a unified, peaceful, and democratic country.

　　德国的货币问题
      丁明
　　一、美、英、法蓄意分裂德国
    上月二十三日的四外长会议的议事议程上，德国货币问题也是其中的一项。德国货币之所以成为问题，完全是由于美、英、法三国当局违反波茨坦协定，于去年六月十八日片面实行“货币改革”的结果。
    苏联是一贯主张德国货币改革应在四强同意下在全德共同施行的。直到西德“货币改革”法令公布的前一天，苏联军政府首脑索柯洛夫斯基元帅还说，苏联占领当局准备支持四国所同意的德国货币改革。但是，蓄意分裂德国的美、英、法三国当局，对于苏联的建议，意不赞同。依然执行一贯的分裂政策——单独的“货币改革”，企图破坏德境苏占区的经济，和分裂柏林的经济。
    然而，分裂柏林只是西方国家肢解德国总政策的一环。从一九四七年一月一日开始，美英侵略集团就采取了一系列分裂德国的措施，如美英两占区的合并、关于保留卡迭尔的第五十六条法律，美、英、法三国关于鲁尔煤炭输出和分配的协定，美英关于改组联合占领区行政机构，建立联占区最高法庭和成立德国州银行的决定。一九四八年二月到六月，美、英、法三国外长更在伦敦举行了有关德国问题的单独的会议。会议所通过的决定，规定完成分裂和肢解德国、破坏对德和约的缔结，使德国经济从属于美英的目的，和使美英垄断资本在鲁尔工业中占统治地位。而西德的“货币改革”则是伦敦会议后的第一个分裂行动。
    这种单独的“货币改革”，是西方当局久已处心积虑势在必行的。它的准备工作，远在一九四七年伦敦外长会议以前，即已开始。在包装新马克的纸上，印有“华盛顿，一九四七年十一月十六日”的戳记，即其证明。
    现在，德国由于西德的“货币改革”的结果，在经济上使西德和东德隔离起来，事实上等于把西德变成了美英垄断资本支配的国家——这正是伦敦会议所要达到的目的。
    正如前面所指出的，西德的新币是在华盛顿印刷的，而且可以按照美国当局的需要而尽量印行。它的印行是不受德国代表监督和管制的；不但如此，它既不能作东西两占区间的支付手段，也不能作为对外的支付手段。这一点，英国军事总督罗伯逊的财政顾问在公布“货币改革”法令的那一天，曾在记者招待会上公开宣布：“只有美元才能作为东西两区间的和对外贸易的支付手段。”因此，西德的新币，一点也不象德国的真正货币，它不过是美国的军用票而已。德意志通讯社佛兰克福电讯称：西部占领区发行了七十五亿新马克，大部份被占领当局留作己用。它们控制了“德国马克”的印刷和分配，因而获得了收入的丰富来源。
　　二、“货币改革”使劳动人民遭殃
    西德的这种“货币改革”，使劳动人民遭受重大牺牲，而使美国资本家及与其有联系的资本家与投机家大发币改财。
    根据币改法令，德国工人按照一对一的比例，每月只能换到四十马克，到月终才能再领到二十马克。依照币改当时的物价，据瓦登堡——巴登州的财政部长说，只够一个人维持最低生活水准八天之用。工人的苦况可以想见。另一方面，币改法令却规定可以供给企业家以大量资金，因而银行家和工业家实际上不必动用基金。而且法令上没有对付黑市牟利者所攫取的不义之财的办法，因此，他们可以利用币改，乘机牟利。
    不但如此，随着币改而来的，是垄断资本家大大提高物价，使人民生活水平更加激烈下降。据英国军政府的机关报世界报去年八月十七日所载，币改以后，煤价已涨了百分之一一七，这就意味着煤气、电力、钢铁、建筑材料和肥料的腾贵。非铁金属的价格也大涨。并且，由于规定马克与美金的比价为一马克对三角美金，使纺织和制革工业的进口原料价格增加了二至三倍。例如原棉已由一公斤一马克廿芬尼（马克以下的单位，一百芬尼等于一马克），涨到三马克廿芬尼了。去年九月，联占区行政委员会宣布十月一日起进一步增价。煤气每一立方英尺增到四六芬尼，到一月底为止电力每一千瓦已涨了三芬尼、牛肉每磅涨了百分之二十六、猪肉百分之三十六，原卖四十五芬尼一公斤的白面包，现在要五十四芬尼了。
    据下萨克森州计划与统计局（在汉诺威）估计，在物价增长以后，四口之家至少要二百四十三马克才能勉强维持生活。但在美占区，有三个儿女的家庭的口粮就要化掉（去年七月）二百二十八马克，而一个五金工业中的工人每月只能赚一百九十二马克。其他工人的工资更少，生活水平就更不如了。因此，币改以后工人的生活处境是十分悲惨的。
    购买力的降低，固然是工人生活下降的原因之一，而失业的增加，使他们的生活更恶化。币改以后，立刻传来慕尼黑的小企业解雇职工的消息，而且汉堡的若干企业也立刻倒闭，公务员立刻遭受解职等等，不一而具。到了今天，西部占领区已有二百万人左右失业。失业的增加，币改也是主要原因之一。
    与刚刚开始实行币改时筹码短缺的情形相反，由于西方占领当局的滥发纸币，德国造成了通货膨胀。到去年十二月中旬，依据美国人的说法，新马克流通的数量几乎增加了一倍（一百四十亿）。但是，据德意志通讯社称：在华盛顿印刷的新马克，究竟有多少未交给德国州银行而直接进入流通，是没有人知道的。而且，美元既是唯一的支付手段，美国银行正以七分到八分美金对一马克的比例，套取“德国马克”，而官价则是三角美金对一马克。通货膨胀是美英对西德人民实行财政掠夺的又一新花样。
    可是，美英当局对德国人民的经济侵略，并不到此止步。今年三月二十一日，他们又禁止苏联领占区德国发行银行的德国马克在柏林西部流通。这一反动措施对于柏林西区人民造成了巨大损害，因为有很多住在西区的人在东区工作，而且又有些住在东区的人在西区工作。这一措施使得住在西区而在东区工作和获取配给品的居民遭受歧视，并且使西区的居民失掉一些钱财——每笔存款中仅有十五马克可以兑换，且对现在的帐目与存款不再折算。德意志通讯社指出西方国家的这一措施，乃是对“人民所持有的货币的政治掠夺”，是一点也不错的。
　　三、苏联军政府被迫采取对策
    由于西方实行了单独的“货币改革”，为了使苏占区和大柏林区不致遭受西德币改的不幸影响，并保证经济生活的正常发展，苏联军政府遂不得不在去年六月二十一日实行另一种货币改革。但是，与西德币改相反，苏联军政府的改革货币，是“为了劳动人民的利益，社会的正义，和尽可能迅速地恢复和发展德国的平时经济”的。
    为了保护劳动人民的现金收入，改革法令上明白规定准许以一对一的比率兑换七十马克。而且，对于劳动人民与少量存款人的利益，也予以尊重，凡存款在一百马克以下者，准以一对一的比率折算，一千马克以内者以五对一折算。而且对于农民在土地改革后所获得的信用贷款，准许以五对一的比率兑换。
    为了没收战时投机家、奸商、暴发户、黑市商人们的资金，规定凡银行存款超过五千马克，或每户兑换在五千马克以上时，必须查明其存款来源，认为合法时，方准兑换。但对人民的企业资本，则按有利比例，予以兑换。
    因此，苏占区的货币改革，巩固了德国货币制度，创造了经济发展的有利条件，并提高了人民的生活水平。从而，自币改以来，全区共发行了四十一亿一千二百万德国马克，以后就再没有增发过，流通中的货币总额，始终保持四十一亿一千二百万的数量。而且，由于实施了各种经济措施，新马克（德国马克）的购买力已大见提高，人民生活也日趋改善。
    例如，在币改以后，当一月间西方占领区牛肉每磅卖一马克四十二芬尼时，苏占区只要八十芬尼，白面包每磅只要三十四芬尼，而西方占领区则为五十四芬尼。而且，苏占区工人的工资也比西方占领区的高。高度熟练工人工资每小时一马克四十四芬尼，而西方占领区最高者也仅仅一马克十二芬尼。
　　四、美英法政府不履行莫斯科和巴黎协定
    后来，在美、英、法三国政府要求之下，而由它们的代表在莫斯科举行的谈判，原已获得了解决货币问题的协议，规定以苏占区马克为柏林唯一的货币，停止“Ｂ”记马克在柏林流通；规定柏林单一货币流通条例，由苏占区发行银行经过柏林现存信用机关实行之，并设立由四国总督代表组成的金融委员会，监督柏林和单一货币流通的各项措施。并于去年八月三十日发表了公报。对于这个它们的代表所签订的协定，美、英、法三国政府竟出尔反尔，予以批驳，以致未能执行。去年十月在巴黎的非正式谈判中，仍然达到了类似协议，但是，这个协议也没有逃出前一协议的同一命运。不但如此，美、英、法三国当局还变本加厉，进一步又在今年三月二十一日下令停止苏占区马克在西柏林流通。因此，就使得产生柏林问题的单独的币改制度，一直没有获得解决。这就证明西方当局有意识地、人工地和武断地制造“柏林问题”。其目的在转移德国人民对西部占领区中分裂措施的注意力，掩盖西方国家变西德为其军事战略基地及巩固美国帝国主义在欧洲的地位的起点之活动。
    所有这些清楚地表明美、英、法三国和苏联的不同的目的与政策。西方三国当局分裂和肢解德国的政策，为的是奴役西德人民，利用他们的经济力达到帝国主义的侵略目的。至于苏联的政策，则是保卫和平与民主，遵守雅尔塔和波茨坦协定，扶助德国成为一个统一、和平与民主的国家。
