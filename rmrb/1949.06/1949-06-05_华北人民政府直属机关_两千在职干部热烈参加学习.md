　　North China People's Government Directly Subordinate Organizations
  　Two Thousand On-the-Job Cadres Enthusiastically Participate in Learning
    [Our Newspaper's News] On the original foundation, the directly subordinate organizations of the North China People's Government have organized more than two thousand on-the-job cadres (including responsible leaders and leading cadres) to participate in learning after rectification. According to the different political theories and cultural levels, they are divided into three major groups: The learning content of Group A mainly consists of twelve theoretical books, with self-study as the main method and discussion as a supplement. Group B mainly studies "Political Economics," in the form of large lectures, and has now completed the fourth chapter of "Political Economics." Group C (Spare-time School) has the largest number of people (1047), focusing on cultural learning. It is divided into nine classes, with middle and primary school sections. Nine cadres who have left production are specially appointed as teachers, with twelve hours of study per week, four hours for politics and eight hours for culture. The middle school section also includes subjects such as Chinese language and algebra.
    After Group A formulated individual study plans, Secretary Jin of the Secretariat Group has re-read "Political Economics" and squeezed time to give large lectures to Group B; Secretary Dong plans to read eight pages of books every day, and can read the twelve books (a total of 2,500 pages) twice in two years; Group A of the Bank has finished reading "On the Food Tax" (Selected Works of Lenin, Volume 16). On policy learning, the Learning Committee often invites leaders to make special reports and organizes everyone to study and discuss. Groups B and C have also overcome some past phenomena of looseness and laissez-faire, and 95% of the people can arrive on time for classes. Some comrades who could not even write their names before can now read the Dazhong Daily, write letters, and calculate five-digit multiplication and two-digit division, and work efficiency has also improved accordingly.

　　华北人民政府直属机关
  　两千在职干部热烈参加学习
    【本报讯】华北人民政府各直属机关在旧有基础上，经过整顿，已经有两千多在职干部（包括负责首长、领导干部），组织起来参加学习。根据政治理论和文化水平的不同，分了三个大组：甲组学习内容主要是十二本理论书籍，以自修为主，讨论为辅。乙组主要是“政治经济学”，方式是上大课，现已讲完“政治经济学”第四章。丙组（业余学校）人数最多（一○四七人），以学习文化为主，编了九个班，分为中学、小学两部，有九个脱离生产的干部专门担任教员，规定每周学习十二小时，四小时学政治，八小时学文化；中学部并包括国文、代数等课目。
    甲组在订出个人学习计划后，秘书厅小组金秘书长已将政治经济学重新读完，并挤时间给乙组上大课；董秘书长计划每天读八页书，两年内可将十二本书（共二千五百页）读两遍；银行甲组已将“论粮食税”（列宁选集十六卷）读完。政策学习上，学委会经常请首长做专题报告，组织大家研究讨论。乙、丙组也克服了过去某些散漫自流现象，百分之九十五的人已能准时到课。有的同志以前连名字都不会写，现在已经能看大众报，能写信，能算五位乘法、二位除法，工作效率也随着提高。
