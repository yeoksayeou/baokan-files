Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 24th -- The first Northeast Military Industry Meritorious Workers and Model Representatives Conference, lasting thirteen days, concluded on the 18th of this month. More than a thousand people attended the meeting, including meritorious workers and model representatives, as well as employee representatives, from the entire Northeast military industry. The Northeast military industry has grown from nothing, from small to large, and from scattered to unified and centralized over the past three years, making a tremendous contribution to supporting the liberation war in the entire Northeast and the entire country. In the past three years, 4,895 meritorious workers and model workers have emerged in the military industry sector. Zhou Huan, Director of the Political Department of the Northeast Military Region, stated in his speech that future military industry construction should begin to focus on new national defense construction, laying a material foundation for further modernization of the troops. To this end, it is necessary to carefully summarize the work experience of the past three years and absorb the advanced experience of Soviet socialism to educate all military industry cadres and employees. The conference summarized the experience of carrying out the meritorious service campaign in the past and determined that it must develop in the direction of collective meritorious service in the future, and overcome the shortcomings of the past in which few people other than employees directly involved in production participated in the meritorious service campaign. The conference called on meritorious workers and models to make persistent efforts to earn more merits in the construction of the new national defense industry. Finally, the conference elected Ding Zizhen, Jiao Shufang and other 20 people as representatives to attend the Northeast Labor Hero and Model Worker Conference in December of this year.

    东北军工模范集会
    要在新国防工业中集体立功
    【新华社沈阳二十四日电】东北军事工业第一届功臣模范代表大会历时十三日，已于本月十八日闭幕。参加会议的有全东北军事工业的功臣模范代表及职工代表千余人。东北军事工业三年来从无到有，从小到大，从分散到统一集中，在支援全东北和全国解放战争上作了巨大贡献。三年来军工部门中涌现出的功臣模范达四千八百九十五名。东北军区政治部周桓主任在会中讲话时提出今后的军工建设应开始着眼于新的国防建设，为部队打下进一步现代化的物质基础。为此必须很好地总结三年来的工作经验，并吸取苏联社会主义的先进经验，以此教育全体军工干部和职工。大会总结了过去开展立功运动的经验，确定今后必须向集体立功方向发展，并克服过去除直接参加生产的职工外，其他人员很少参加立功运动的缺点。大会号召功臣模范们再接再厉，争取在建设新的国防工业中功上加功。大会最后选出丁字振、焦树芳等二十人为出席今年十二月全东北劳动英雄劳动模范大会的代表。
