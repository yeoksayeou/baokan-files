　　PLA Art Troupe Worker Bi Gefei
  　One of the Delegates to the Literary and Art Congress

    Among the soldiers of the 60th Army of the 18th Corps, almost everyone knows Bi Gefei and his allegro poems. He can write and speak; as soon as his allegro poems are written, the troops everywhere start humming them, and the listeners all come running!

    Gefei was born in Gaoping, Shanxi, in 1919, and is only thirty years old this year. Born into a middle peasant family, he only studied until the first year of junior high school. During the "July 7th" Resistance War Against Japan, Gefei was only eighteen years old. Filled with enthusiasm, he ran to the troops to fight as a guerrilla, starting a life of combat that he has persisted in to this day. In 1942, when opening up the Zhongtiao Mountains in Shanxi, after winning a battle, they should have immediately moved their position, but due to complacency, they did not resolutely follow the superior's instruction to move once a day. As a result, they were surrounded by the enemy, and the troops suffered losses, and he was wounded. This battle gave him a deep and painful lesson, and from then on, he was determined to work hard in the army to make up for these losses. At the end of 1942, the troops selected model cadres, and Gefei was elected by everyone. At that time, the struggle in the army was very arduous, and there were many heroic deeds that needed to be reflected. Gefei saw this and thought of compiling many popular things, such as drum lyrics and allegro, to tell the soldiers. He would tell a section at every meeting, and the soldiers were extremely happy. This gave him a great inspiration, making him understand the soldiers' demands for literature and art, and at the same time, he began to explore literary and art forms that serve the soldiers. After that, he led the propaganda team deep into the troops. After more than two years, he did a very good job in the propaganda team work. At the labor model conference in the entire Taiyue area, he was elected as a model instructor.

    At the end of 1946, after their team fought in Yuanqu, there were casualties in the troops, and many soldiers had the idea of ​​resting for a while and training the new recruits before fighting again. However, at this time, the combat mission was very urgent and required continuous operations. Comrade Gefei, combined with the leading cadres of the unit, went deep to understand the soldiers' ideological situation, combined with the intentions of the leaders, and discovered Jiao Wubao, the mutual aid group leader, in the troops—this typical example of fighting and teaching, leading new recruits to victory. He promptly reported on it, introduced the experience of Jiao Wubao's combat mutual aid group, and later, after the leadership called for it, the Jiao Wubao movement was widely launched in the troops, setting off a wave of meritorious service of new heroism, and successfully completing the combat mission. Gefei was awarded a special merit in this movement.

    In March 1948, during the Linfen campaign, Gefei took the lead in launching the writing of trench leaflets in the troops, which was immediately supported by the broad masses of soldiers. The soldiers' lives in the trenches were very hard. In addition, Linfen was a "reclining ox city" and was relatively difficult to attack. At that time, the tactic of tunnel warfare was used to attack the enemy, and the enemy also used tunnels to counter-tunnel. The struggle was very sharp. After seventy-two days of arduous combat, our army gloriously completed the task of liberating Linfen. In this battle, Gefei's trench leaflets (allegro) played a considerable role, giving the soldiers great encouragement and education, and helping to resolve many of the soldiers' concerns. For example, his allegro describing this underground tunneling battle, entitled "Making Airplanes for the Enemy," said: "Our earthen airplane is for the enemy to ride, it doesn't fly in the sky, it drills underground, the infantry builds the runway, the engineers drive the plane, when the enemy gets on, they all die happily!" Another example is "Attacking Deep": "In deep battles, be bold, attack fiercely and rush inward. Poke the enemies, make them all confused, don't let the turtles catch their breath..." These allegros were widely circulated in the trenches at that time, and were of great encouragement and guidance to the soldiers. Therefore, he was awarded another major merit in the Linfen campaign. In the Taiyuan campaign, he also wrote many allegros, and after each battle or each battle report, he immediately followed up with allegros.

    Based on his experience in writing allegros, Gefei believes that allegros must be closely integrated with the central work of the troops, writing about what is being done. Integrate and implement the leaders' intentions, combine with the needs of the soldiers, and dispel the soldiers' concerns. At the same time, he believes that to write allegros well, one must go deep into the masses, humbly learn from the masses, discover their problems, gradually concentrate them little by little, and then write them in the language most familiar to the masses, the "language of soldiers" to be effective and vivid. Because allegros are short, concise, flexible, and easy to coordinate with work, soldiers are easy to accept and easy to learn, and ordinary soldiers can write them themselves, or can speak, and others write down what they say. This form can coordinate with actual struggle and enliven the mood of the troops, and can serve the war well. Therefore, the general soldiers reflected: "It's energetic and easy to say, easy to understand, easy to remember, and interesting, it introduces methods and encourages, the content is specific and practical." They also said: "Allegro is the instruction of the superiors, the experience of everyone, it's really useful to learn..."

　　部队文艺工作者毕革飞
  　文代大会代表访问之一
    在十八兵团六十军的战士中，几乎没有一个人不晓得毕革飞和他的快板诗。他能写能说，只要他的快板诗一写成，部队里就到处都哼哼起来，听的人也都跑来啦！
    革飞一九一九年生于山西高平，今年还只三十岁。出身中农，他读书只读到初中一年级。“七七”抗战时，革飞才十八岁，抱着满腔的热情跑到部队中打游击，开始了战斗的生活，一直坚持到现在。一九四二年开辟山西中条山，在打了一次胜仗后，本应立刻转移阵地，但他们因轻敌没有坚决执行上级底一天转移一次的指示，结果被敌人包围了，部队受了损失，他负了伤。这次战斗中，给他很深痛的血的教训，从此他下决心好好在部队里搞工作来补偿这些损失。工作到一九四二年底，部队里选模范干部，革飞被大家推选出来了。当时部队斗争非常艰苦，又有很多英勇事迹需要反映，革飞看到了这一点，就想法编了许多通俗的东西，如鼓词、快板等，说给战士们听，每次开会他就说一段，战士们高兴极了。这时给了他一个很大的启示，使他了解到战士们对文艺的要求，同时他也开始摸索到了为士兵服务的文艺形式。之后，他领导宣传队深入到部队中去，经过两年多的时间，把宣传队工作搞的非常好，在全太岳区的劳模大会上，他被选为模范指导员。
    一九四六年底，他们队伍在垣曲战斗以后，部队中因有伤亡，许多战士中间，有休息一下等把新兵练好了再去打仗的思想情绪，可是这时战斗任务非常紧急，需要连续作战，革飞同志结合该部队的领导干部，深入了解了战士们的思想情况，结合领导的意图，就在部队里发现了互助组长焦五保，——这个边战边教带领新兵打了胜仗的典型，及时的进行报导，介绍了焦五保战斗互助组的经验，后来又经过领导上号召，在部队中普遍地开展了焦五保运动。掀起了新英雄主义的立功浪潮，胜利的完成了作战任务。在这个运动中革飞记了特功。
    一九四八年三月，在临汾战役中，革飞领头在部队里展开了写战壕传单，马上得到了广大战士的拥护。战士们在战壕里的生活很艰苦。又加上临汾是一个卧牛城比较难打，当时就采用了坑道战法进攻敌人，敌人也同样以坑道来反坑道，斗争非常尖锐，经过了七十二天艰苦的战斗过程，最后我军光荣完成了解放临汾的任务。在这一战斗中，革飞的战壕传单（快板）发挥了相当大的作用，给战士们很大的鼓舞与教育，帮助解决了战士们许多顾虑。如他描写这种地下挖坑道的战斗快板，题目叫做“给敌人做飞机”上说：“咱们土飞机，是叫敌人坐，不在天上飞，钻在地底下，步兵修跑道，工兵把机驾，敌人一坐上，全都美死啦！”又如“打纵深”：“纵深战斗要大胆，猛打猛冲往里钻。把敌人，都戳乱，不让龟孙把气喘……。”这些快板当时在战壕里普遍的流传着，对战士的鼓励和指导是非常大的。因此临汾战役中他又被记下了一大功。在太原战役中，他也同样写了许多快板，每打一仗或发一次战报，他就马上跟着写出快板来。
    革飞根据自己写快板得到几点经验，他认为快板必须紧密结合部队的中心工作，作啥写啥。结合领导意图贯彻下去，结合战士需要，解除战士顾虑。同时他认为要写好快板，就一定要深入到群众中去，虚心向群众学习，发现他们的问题，一点一点的逐渐集中起来，然后用群众最熟悉的话，“兵言兵语”写出来才能有力，才能生动。因为快板短小精悍、灵活，容易配合工作，战士容易接受容易学习，而且一般战士自己也都会写，或者会说，说了别人写。这种形式能配合实际斗争又能活跃部队的情绪，能很好的为战争服务。因此一般的战士们反映说：“又带劲儿又顺嘴，好懂好记有趣味，有介绍方法有鼓励，内容具体又实际。”又说：“快板是上级的指示，大家的经验，学了实在顶用……。”
