　　Huadian Opens Celebration Meeting
  　Comrade Liu Ding Calls for Efforts to Achieve Low-Cost Power Supply
    [Our Newspaper's Dispatch] The North China Electric Power Company held a celebration meeting yesterday (the 11th), attended by all employees of the head office and the Beijing branch, administrative and worker representatives from the Ping, Tianjin, Tangshan, and Zhangjiakou branches, and representatives from the North China Iron and Steel Company and the Cement Company, totaling over 1,200 people. Liu Ding, Deputy Minister of the Enterprise Department of the North China Government, and Comrade Liu Zijiu of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions attended and delivered speeches. Deputy Minister Liu Ding first congratulated the establishment of the North China Electric Power Company and extended his respects to the electric power employees on behalf of the North China Government. He pointed out: We must devote all our efforts to developing industry in the future, and the development of industry is inseparable from the development of the electric power industry. We must get all the machines running, provide sufficient power and all electricity needs, and also expand hydroelectric and thermal power construction, striving for the supply of low-cost electricity. Low electricity prices are the demand of the people and also the demand of the government. All our employees must organize all forces, not allowing any waste. This is a measure of the extent to which we serve the people. He also said: Our purpose in operating the electric power industry is not to make a profit, nor to lose money, but to be self-reliant. He believes that in a very short period, with everyone's efforts, great achievements will be obtained. Finally, he called on everyone to strengthen training, improve political awareness, and under the leadership of Chairman Mao, become builders of the New Democratic economy and a powerful national construction force of Chairman Mao.
    Bao Guobao, General Manager of the North China Electric Power Company, stated in his speech: In the future, under the leadership of the North China Government, we must help industrial construction and work to improve the lives of the people of North China. We will follow the instructions of our superiors to "rely on the masses, depend on the masses," and add to this our own learning, to complete the task of building the North China electric power industry. Worker representatives from various branches, in their speeches, unanimously proposed "to intensify learning, work hard in production, and ensure the smooth completion of the Five-Year Plan." And also to "save coal and materials, to achieve a reduction in electricity prices."
    Comrade Liu Zijiu of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, on behalf of the ACFTU, extended warm congratulations to the meeting. He explained in detail the significance and organizational methods of the Factory Management Committee and the Industrial Trade Union. He said that the Factory Management Committee has three meanings: it is the best form of relying on workers, it is a manifestation of workers being the masters of the factory, and it is a good opportunity for workers to learn how to manage factory production. In the afternoon, the troupe of the head office and the Beijing branch performed various programs, and in the evening, the Third Literary and Art Troupe of the China University performed "Red Flag Song" to celebrate.

　　华电开庆祝成立大会
  　刘鼎同志号召争取廉价供电
    【本报讯】华北电业公司于昨（十一）日举行庆祝成立大会，到会者有总公司及北平分公司全体员工，平、津、唐、张分公司行政暨职工代表，华北钢铁公司、水泥公司代表共一千二百余人。华北政府企业部刘鼎副部长、全国总工会刘子久同志均出席讲话。刘鼎副部长首先庆祝华北电业公司的成立，并代表华北政府向电业员工致敬。他指出：我们今后要全力发展工业，而发展工业与发展电业是分不开的。我们要把机器全部运转起来，供给足够的动力及一切用电的需要，还要扩大水电及火电建设，争取廉价电力的供给。电价低廉是人民的要求，也是政府的要求，我们全体员工要把各种力量组织起来，不让它有一点浪费，这是测验我们为人民服务程度的尺度。他同时说：我们经营电业的宗旨是不赚钱、不赔本，自力更生。相信在很短的时期内，在大家努力之下，会得到很大的成绩。最后他号召大家加强锻炼，提高政治觉悟，在毛主席领导下，成为新民主主义经济建设者，成为毛主席的有力的建国部队。
    华北电业公司总经理鲍国宝在讲话时表示：今后一定在华北政府领导下，帮助工业建设，为华北人民的生活改善而工作。遵照上级“依靠群众、依赖群众”的指示，再加上自己的学习，完成建设华北电业的任务。各分公司职工代表在讲话中，一致提出“加紧学习，努力生产，保证五年计划的顺利完成”。并且要“节煤节料，达到电价的减低”。
    全国总工会刘子久同志代表全总向大会致热烈的祝贺。他详细解释了工厂管理委员会及产业工会的意义及组织办法。他说工厂管理委员会有三个意义：是依靠工人的最好形式，是工人当了工厂主人翁的表现，是工人学习管理工厂生产的好机会。下午有总公司、北平分公司之剧团表演各种节目，晚间由华大第三文工团出演“红旗歌”，以示庆祝。
