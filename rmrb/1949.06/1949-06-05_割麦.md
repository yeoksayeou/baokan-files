　　Harvesting Wheat
    Yan Wu
    A gust of southern wind blows,
    Turning the wheat fields golden and vast.
    Men, women, old and young, all go to the fields,
    Working together, exchanging labor, busy harvesting.
    The little sickles go swish, swish, swish,
    Smiling at the wheat,
    Threshing forward along the rows.
    Three or two handfuls tied into bundles,
    The wheat stalks lined up, covering the ground.
    Carried by shoulder pole, loaded onto carts,
    The golden wheat goes to the threshing ground.
    During the day, everyone goes to the fields to harvest wheat together,
    At night, there are armed patrols,
    Strictly preventing those bad elements,
    Our security must be vigilant.
    The wheat hasn't come home,
    Every night,
    We go to the fields to check for security.

　　割麦
    雁伍
    一阵子南风吹，
    小麦遍地黄。
    男女老少齐下地，
    互助变工割麦忙。
    刹刹刹小镰刀子，
    看着麦子笑，
    顺着垄眼向前扬。
    三把两把打成捆，
    麦个子排队满地躺。
    担子担、大车装，
    金黄黄的麦子走进了场。
    白天里上地齐割麦，
    黑夜里下地有武装，
    严防那坏分子，
    咱们查防要紧张。
    麦子不回家，
    天天晚上，
    咱到地里去查防。
