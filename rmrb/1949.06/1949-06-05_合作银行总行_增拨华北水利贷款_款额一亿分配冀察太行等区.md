  　Increases North China Water Conservancy Loans
  　Amount of 100 Million Allocated to Areas such as Hebei, Chahar, and Taihang

    [This newspaper reports] The Cooperative Bank Headquarters has increased its North China water conservancy loan by 100 million yuan. The North China water conservancy loan was arranged for 95 million yuan in January of this year, and most of it has now been issued. The Ministry of Agriculture, based on the current situation, has drafted the amount and usage plan, and at the end of last month, it consulted with the Cooperative Bank Headquarters and agreed to increase it by another 100 million yuan to meet the needs of various places. This loan will be calculated at a real value when repaid (the portion used for waterwheels will be converted to iron, and the portion used for canal excavation will be converted to rice), with a monthly interest rate of 2 to 3 percent in kind. The allocated areas include central Hebei, southern Hebei, eastern Hebei, Chahar, Taihang, and other areas, and are currently being distributed one after another.
