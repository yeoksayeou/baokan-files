Chahar Province Holds Second Production Conference
　　Fully Launching Summer Production
　　Grasping Weeding, Flood Prevention, Silt Deposition, Fertilizer Accumulation, and Tree Planting
　　Establishing a Long-Term Construction and Production-First Ideology

[This News Report] The Chahar Provincial People's Government and the Chahar Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party convened the second provincial production conference on June 6th. More than 300 responsible cadres from various districts and cities/counties, as well as directly subordinate units, attended. The conference involved group and plenary discussions, as well as thematic speeches, and concluded on the 14th. During the conference, various localities reviewed the leadership of spring production, and thoroughly discussed and exchanged experiences on issues such as water conservancy, cooperation, organization, Party branch leadership, and the mass line. The conference also focused on discussing how to ensure the completion of the summer production plan based on the specific conditions of each locality. Chairman Zhang Su of the Provincial Government gave a concluding speech, stating: The conference has successfully concluded. The summer production plan has been slightly revised based on the discussions in various localities: The province requires planting 10.35 million trees, afforesting 36,930 mu, cultivating 4,925 mu of nurseries, and eliminating 545,000 mu of wasteland. He then pointed out: The mistakes and problems in past production were all caused by not acting according to the actual situation. This time, in implementing the summer production plan, all localities are required to proceed from the actual situation and the demands of the masses, and study specific implementation measures. Our production plan starts from reality, takes care of the future, starts from the local, and takes care of the overall situation. We must patiently help the masses plan and calculate the pros and cons. We must painstakingly discuss with the masses carefully to ensure that we neither commit coercive orders nor let things drift. Judging from the reports from various localities, the masses still have many concerns. If we find that production is not vigorous in a certain place, we should study what problems there are and immediately solve them with all our strength. Only in this way will the masses dare to produce and get rich. At the same time, we must thoroughly eliminate bandits, resettle returning personnel for production, transform smokers and vagrants to participate in production, and investigate saboteurs. Those who continue to endanger the people should be dealt with according to the law in order to stabilize social order. He also clarified issues such as organization, water conservancy, and cooperatives. Finally, Chairman Zhang Su called on everyone to establish the idea of long-term construction and production first. The Party, government, and people should all put production work in the first place. Although departments have divisions of labor, they should all revolve around production and be closely integrated with production. We must learn production technology from everyone who understands production, and lead production with production. When transmitting this conference, all localities should proceed according to the circumstances and not relax current production. Subsequently, Vice Chairman Li Jihuan of the Provincial Government announced the results of the evaluation of model units and individuals by the conference's award evaluation committee, and awarded certificates and medals after the meeting. Finally, Comrade Yang Gengtian, Secretary of the Chahar Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, spoke, pointing out: The leadership of production has been strengthened compared with the past, reversing the past leadership style of being tight at the beginning and loose at the end. The basic shortcoming is that the leadership cannot keep up with the demands of the masses. The broad masses of people want to recuperate, do a good job in production, get rich, and live a good life. However, due to certain mistakes in the implementation of policies, individual areas have infringed upon the interests of middle peasants, and some are still infringing, coupled with insufficient propaganda, the masses still have concerns and dare not let go of production and get rich. Therefore, we must: 1. Break down the masses' concerns and correctly implement policies. Infringements on the interests of middle peasants must be resolutely corrected, and future infringements must be absolutely prohibited. 2. The process of leading production is also a process of ideological mobilization and improvement of farmers. Impatience will lead to coercive orders, but when the conditions are ripe for the masses, the key lies in the leadership, otherwise it will lead to laissez-faire. The leadership must be combined with the masses. 3. Take production as the center and appropriately and step-by-step resolve the remaining problems of land reform to ensure the smooth development of production. 4. Require leading cadres to personally take action, take apprentices, create typical examples, and special districts and counties directly help districts to implement policies in the villages, so that resolutions are not discounted or are discounted less. Finally, Comrade Yang Gengtian pointed out: To ensure the completion of summer tasks, we must grasp the center. Among the various tasks of summer production, we should emphasize more on weeding, flood prevention, silt deposition, green manure accumulation, and tree planting, and among the four items, we should especially grasp weeding.

　　察省举行第二次生产会议
  　全力开展夏季生产
    抓紧锄苗防洪放淤积肥植树
    树立长期建设生产第一思想
    【本报讯】察省人民政府、中共察省省委于六月六日召开全省第二次生产会议，到会各分区及市、县负责干部各直属单位共三百余人。会议经小组、大会讨论，专题发言，于十四日结束。会中，各地对春季生产领导作了检查，对水利、合作、组织起来、支部领导、群众路线等问题均详细研讨交流经验；并着重讨论了如何根据本地具体情况，保证夏季生产计划的完成。会议由省府张苏主席作结论，他说：大会胜利结束，夏季生产计划根据各地讨论情形略有修正：全省要求植树一千零三十五万株，造林三万六千九百三十亩，培育苗圃四千九百二十五亩，消灭荒地五十四万五千亩。接着指出：过去生产中犯错误、出毛病，皆因不按情况作事所致，这次执行夏季生产计划，要求各地按实际情况与群众要求出发，研究具体办法执行。我们生产计划是从现实出发照顾将来，从局部出发照顾全面。要耐心帮助群众计划，算清利害，要苦口婆心与群众仔细商量，作到既不犯强迫命令又不放任自流。从各地汇报看来，群众顾虑尚多。发现那里生产搞的不起劲，即应研究有何问题，立即全力解决，只有这样群众才敢生产发财。同时，要彻底肃清土匪，安置还乡人员生产，改造烟民、二流子参加生产；追查破坏分子，其继续危害人民者应依法处理，以安定社会秩序。对组织起来及水利、合作社等问题亦均有所阐明。最后张苏主席号召大家要树立长期建设生产第一的思想，党、政、民都应把生产工作放到第一位；部门虽有分工，但均应围绕生产，密切结合生产。要向一切懂生产的人学习生产技术，以生产领导生产。各地在传达此次会议时，应按情况进行，不能放松当前生产。继由省府李济寰副主席宣布大会评奖委员会对各地模范单位和个人评判结果，并分别于会后发给奖状奖章。会议最后由中共察省省委书记杨耕田同志讲话，他指出：生产领导较以往加强了，一反过去前紧后松的领导作风。基本缺点是领导赶不上群众要求。广大群众要求休养生息，搞好生产，发财致富，过好日子。但由于执行政策上犯了某些毛病，个别地区侵犯中农利益，而且有的还在侵犯，加上宣传不深入，群众还有顾虑，不敢放手生产发财。因此必须：一、打破群众顾虑，正确贯彻政策，侵犯中农利益必须坚决纠正，今后绝对不许侵犯。二、领导生产过程也是农民思想发动与提高的过程，急躁就要犯强迫命令；但群众条件成熟了，关键又在于领导，不然又会放任自流，领导必须与群众结合。三、以生产为中心，适当地、有步骤地解决土改遗留问题，以使生产顺畅发展。四、要求领导干部亲自下手，带徒弟，搞典型，专区、县直接帮助区将政策贯彻到村，使决议不打或少打折扣。最后，杨耕田同志指出：保证夏季任务完成必须抓住中心。夏季生产各项工作中，应更强调锄苗拔草，防洪放淤，压青积肥，植树造林，而四项中又应特别抓紧锄苗拔草。
