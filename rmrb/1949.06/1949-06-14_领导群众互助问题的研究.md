Research on the Problem of Leaders Leading Mass Mutual Aid

　　After the land reform, the peasants' enthusiasm for production increased, but due to the dispersion of land, farm tools, and livestock, and the lack of labor and animal power, individuals faced many difficulties in carrying out production alone. In order to improve their lives, the masses had a demand for mutual aid. Since the beginning of spring, the masses in Xingtai, Neiqiu and other places have been automatically helping each other in building houses, repairing land and building embankments. In Neiqiu, there are 122 groups in nine villages including Dongzhaiyang, Beiliang, and Nansong. Especially in the recent drought resistance, sowing, and wheat watering campaign, the masses in various counties have more widely organized. These mutual aid and labor exchange activities are mostly spontaneously formed, and the forms are mostly small-scale, flexible, and non-fixed. But regardless of the form, they have increased the production power of the masses and solved the practical difficulties at the time, playing a very important role in the drought resistance and sowing stage. However, there are still the following problems in leading the mutual aid work of the masses that need to be studied:

　　　　Cadres' Thinking is Obstructed　Believing that Mutual Aid is Unnecessary

Many district and village cadres do not recognize this spontaneous small-scale mutual aid. Some believe that the masses do not require mutual aid. This is mainly because the cadres have a fixed set of forms for mutual aid in their minds, believing that mutual aid teams must have a team leader and a certain form and system. They use this set of organizational forms imagined subjectively to apply to the current mutual aid and labor exchange groups among the masses. If it doesn't match their ideas, they don't treat it as mutual aid, and they don't lead it. For example, in the Xingtai County district expanded cadre meeting discussing the issue of mutual aid, many cadres believed that the masses did not engage in mutual aid, but after discussing the actual situation below, everyone said: "If doing work like that counts as mutual aid, every village has it, and there's a lot of it!" Secondly, the purpose of mutual aid is not clear enough. They don't recognize it from the perspective of improving labor efficiency and solving the production difficulties of the masses. They mostly simply engage in mutual aid for the sake of mutual aid, and don't look at the good or bad of mutual aid from the perspective of production results, but only look at it from the form. Furthermore, they don't first consider the immediate interests of the masses, and often plan how to lead well first. Therefore, they have not gradually improved on the existing mutual aid foundation of the masses. The masses' desire for leadership is also not obvious, because the set of things we did in the past is not suitable for the needs of the masses in many places, so some are even unwilling to let us lead, and do not admit that their organization is called mutual aid, and do not want cadres to know.

　　　　Old Methods Cannot Be Used　New Methods Have Not Been Learned

Some comrades also know that collective labor among the masses is mutual aid, but because they emphasize adhering to the principle of voluntariness, they believe that the masses have already voluntarily organized themselves, and many do not have team leaders, so how can we lead them again? For example, some district cadres in Gaoyi and Yuanshi helped the masses push waterwheels in the fields, knowing that it was mutual aid pushing, but they were afraid that the masses would not dare to admit it, so they did not dare to ask. Regarding the leadership of mutual aid, some of this is because new cadres feel unable to start because they lack experience, and even many old cadres feel that the current mutual aid teams are difficult to lead. This is mainly because in the past, the organization of mutual aid was mostly through meetings, mobilization, and calls, and some used nominally voluntary but actually coercive methods to organize the masses. If we still use the old methods today, it will naturally not work, but the new methods have not been learned, so we are at a loss.

Some cadres believe that the existing forms of mutual aid are too simple and too low-level, and want to improve it into a complex and advanced organizational form. The result of this forced improvement often collapses the existing mutual aid that has already played a role, or reduces its role. For example, in the old liberated areas, many small groups were turned into large teams for collective action. Because there were too many people, the assembly was slow, and because there were too many clumsy people working in the fields, labor was wasted. In addition, meetings were held in the evening, accounts were settled, the system was complicated, and labor was also wasted. This not only did not benefit the masses, but also added many troubles. Therefore, the masses were afraid of mutual aid.

　　　　Suited to the Needs of the Masses Will Be Supported

The above situation shows that there are still two deviations in our leadership of mutual aid, either administrative orders or abandoning leadership. To solve these problems, we must first clearly define that the purpose of mutual aid is to overcome production difficulties and improve production efficiency. Measuring the good or bad of mutual aid cannot only look at the form. For example, Xu Jiping's mutual aid team in Dongmaxian Village, Gaoyi County, only has three households, three male laborers, and two livestock. Five women also participated in pushing the waterwheel. They have no system and no clear method of equivalent exchange. The exchange of labor is roughly the same. Everyone is working very hard. It doesn't look like "mutual aid", but it is beneficial to all three households. Second, overcome formalism and the old work style of impatience. These deviations have caused mutual aid to take many detours. Therefore, we should first examine which old work styles are not in line with the needs of the masses. The masses in Xingtai said: organizing without mutual aid, not engaging in mutual aid and working together. This is a criticism of our old work style on the one hand, and on the other hand, it shows that the masses demand mutual aid. As long as our leadership is truly suitable for the needs and realistic interests of the masses, it will definitely be supported by the masses. For example, Peng Wen's mother in Caoliu Village, Gaoyi County, asked Da Ou (a party member and cadre) to hire someone to water the land because she had no labor. Da Ou took the opportunity to absorb her into his team and let her and the women in his family push the waterwheel together, promoting her participation in agricultural production. She was very happy that she watered the land without hiring anyone. Liu Chunying and San Pian were talking while resting while working in neighboring fields. Chunying said: "I only have half a livestock, and I can't do anything well." San Pian said: "I only have half a livestock, and it's not convenient to work either." Zhang Laoxin (a party member and cadre) immediately interjected: "If you two families combine your livestock, you won't have to worry. If the power is still not enough, let the women and children in your family participate, and if you help a little more, you'll be able to do it." In this way, the two households naturally combined. Zhang Laoxin also absorbed Er Hei's father, who had weak labor and poor livestock, into his team. He could only plant four mu of cotton in the past. After participating in the mutual aid team, he planted eight mu of cotton, and he was very satisfied. For example, the cadres of Xingtai County went deep into the spontaneously formed mutual aid teams in Xianyu Village, first admitting that it was mutual aid, and said that it was good to be able to work with such mutual aid. The masses talked to him about problems and asked for leadership. This proves that the saying that there is no way to lead if you insist on the principle of voluntariness is wrong. However, some cadres regard going deep into the masses as working in the fields with the masses. For example, Zhao Xiutian, a cadre in the first district of Gaoyi County, has been helping push a waterwheel in a mutual aid team for five days, but he has not dared to ask the masses about the situation and needs of mutual aid. As a result, he still cannot go deep. We must go to the masses to understand various different thoughts and requirements, and according to the production season and different farm work, enlighten the mutual aid requirements of the masses, and organize various small-scale mutual aid and labor exchange teams in different forms, without being bound by institutional forms, as long as it can improve production.

　　　　Solve Specific Difficulties　Reduce Wasted Production Time

The problem of leadership methods is mainly to go deep into typical examples to create experience, and use the actual examples of the time and place to publicize and promote. Go deep into the masses, unite and rely on activists (party members, cadres), and organize and lead mutual aid through them. Although some groups do not have team leaders, there are always one or two leaders. Start by helping them solve specific difficulties, overcome the past practice of working only by holding meetings, do not hold meetings that do not solve problems, and try to hold short meetings, or discuss problems when mutually helping each other in the fields, and use various leisure times such as eating, resting, and visiting the masses to discuss problems or publicize mutual aid policies. In short, we must try to reduce the production time of the masses as much as possible, so that we can transform the spontaneous mutual aid organizations of the masses into guided mutual aid organizations, and gradually improve them.

　　领导群众互助问题的研究
    太行一专办公室合作科研究·奎林整理
    土改结束后农民的生产积极性提高了，但是由于土地、农具、牲口的分散，劳畜力缺乏，个人单独进行生产有很多困难，群众为了把光景过好，就有互助的要求。入春以来，邢台、内邱等地群众修房盖屋，修地垒＠，都是自动的在一起互助变工干活，内邱东寨阳、北良、南宋等九村就有一百二十二个组，特别是在最近抗旱下种浇麦运动中，各县群众更加普遍的组织起来。这些互助变工，多自发组成，形式多是小型的、灵活的、不固定的。但不管形式如何，都增加了群众的生产力量，解决了当时的实际困难，在抗旱下种阶段曾起了十分重大的作用。但是在领导群众的互助工作中还存在着以下几个问题需要研究：
    　　　　干部思想不通　认为不要互助
    不少的区、村干部不承认这种自发的小型互助，有的认为群众就不要求互助，这主要是由于干部思想上对于互助先有了一套固定形式，认为互助组必须有组长，有一定的形式和制度。用自己主观上想象的这一套组织形式去套现在群众中的互助变工组，不碰自己的意，就不把他当作互助看待，也就不去领导。如邢台县区扩大干部会上讨论互助问题中，很多干部认为群众不互助，但把下边的实际情况一谈，大家说：“那样做活就算互助的话，各村都有，而且是多哩！”其次是对互助的目的性不够明确，不是从提高劳动效率，解决群众生产困难的观点上去认识，多是单纯的为互助而互助，不多从生产效果上去看互助的好坏，而只是从形式上去看它。再次是不先从群众的切身利益着想，往往先打算怎样好领导，因之没有在群众现有的互助基础上去逐步提高。群众要求领导的思想也不明显，因为我们过去所搞的一套，好些地方不适合群众要求，所以有的甚至不愿让我们领导，不承认自己的组织叫互助，不叫干部知道。
    　　　　旧方式不能用　新办法没学会
    有些同志也知道群众中的集体劳动就是互助，但因为强调坚持自愿原则，认为群众已经是自愿的组织起来了，又有好多没有组长，我们如何再去领导呢？如高邑、元氏有的区干部在地里帮助群众推水车，明知道是互助推的，但因怕群众不敢承认就不敢问。关于互助的领导，这中间有些是新干部因为没有经验而感到无法下手，就是不少老干部也觉得现在的互助组不好领导。这主要是由于过去组织互助多是开会动员号召，有的用名义自愿实际强制的办法组织群众。今天仍用过去那种办法，自然行不通，但新的办法还没学会，于是就束手无策。
    有些干部认为现有的互助形式太简单、太低级，想把他提高起来，成为一种复杂的高级的组织形式，这样强行提高的结果，常把现有的已经起了作用的互助给提垮了，或者是把作用降低了。如过去老区把不少小组变成大队集体行动，因人多集合慢，又因在地里作活人多笨重而浪费了工，再加晚上开会、算帐，制度又复杂，还得误工，这样不但对群众没利，反而增加了许多麻烦，因此群众怕互助。
    　　　　适合群众要求就会得到拥护
    以上情况说明我们在领导互助中还存在着两种偏向，不是行政命令就是放弃领导。解决这些问题，首先必须十分明确互助的目的是为了克服生产困难，提高生产效率，测量互助的好坏，也就不能光看形式。如高邑东马闲村许际平互助组只有三户，三个男劳力，两个牲口五个妇女也参加推水车，他们没有什么制度，也没有明确的等价办法，工换工大体上也差不多，大家干的很起劲，看起来不象“互助”，对三户却都有利。第二、克服形式主义和急性病的旧作风。这些偏向曾使互助走了很多弯路，因之我们首先应当检查有那些旧作风是与群众要求不碰头的，邢台群众说：组织起来不互助，不搞互助伙干活。这一方面是对我们旧作风的一个批判，一方面又说明群众是要求互助的，只要我们的领导真正适合群众要求与现实利益，一定能得到群众的拥护。如高邑曹刘村朋文的母亲，因自己没有劳力，去让大偶（党员干部）给雇人浇地，大偶就趁机把她吸收到自己组内，让她和自己家里妇女伙推水车，推动她参加了农业生产，没有用人浇了地，她非常高兴。刘春英和三片在邻地做活休息时谈起话来，春英说：“我只有半个牲口，干啥也不得劲儿”。三片说：“我也只半个牲口做活也不方便”。张老新（党员干部）马上就插嘴说：“你们两家把牲口插成犋子就不发愁了，如果力量还不大，让自己家的妇女儿童也参加，再助一把力就满能干了。”这样他两户便很自然的结合起来了，张老新还把劳力弱牲口赖的二黑爹吸收在自己组内，原来只能种四亩花，参加了互助组，他就种了八亩花，他非常满意。又如邢台县干部深入到先于村自发的互助组内，首先承认那就是互助，并说这样互助能够干活就好，群众就向他谈问题而要求领导，这证明所谓坚持自愿原则就没法领导的说法是不对的。但有些干部把深入群众作风当作和群众到地里干活，如高邑一区干部赵秀田一直在一个互组内帮助推了五天水车，也没有敢问一声群众互助的情况和要求，结果仍然不能深入。我们必须是到群众中去了解各种不同的思想要求，根据生产季节和不同的农活，启发群众的互助要求，组织各种不同形式的小型互助变工组，不拘泥制度形式，只要能提高生产就好。
    　　　　解决具体困难　少误生产时间
    领导方法问题，主要是深入典型创造经验，用当时当地的实际例子宣传推广。深入到群众中去，团结和依靠积极分子（党员、干部），通过他们组织和领导互助，虽然有些组没有组长但总有一两个带头人，从帮助他们解决具体困难问题入手，克服过去工作就是开会的作法，不解决问题的会就不要开，并尽量开短会，或在地里互助做活时讨论问题，利用各种闲暇如吃饭、休息，访问群众，讨论问题或宣传互助政策。总之要尽量少误群众的生产时间，这样才能把群众中自发的互助组织变成有领导的互助组织，并逐步提高。
