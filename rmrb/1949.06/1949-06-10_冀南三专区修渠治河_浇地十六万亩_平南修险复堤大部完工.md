Jinnan Three Special District Repairs Canals and Harnesses Rivers
　　Irrigating 160,000 Mu
　　Pingnan's Repair of Dangerous Sections and Reconstruction of Dikes Mostly Completed

　　[Jinnan Electric] The governments at all levels in the Jinnan Three Special District are leading the masses along the rivers to build water conservancy projects, improving the feudal management of river water and unreasonable water usage methods. This spring, 160,000 mu of land were irrigated, ensuring timely sowing. The Fuyang River passes through Chengci, Handan, Jize, Yongnian, and other counties in the district. The masses along the river have the habit of building sluices and digging canals to divert water for irrigation. Before the War of Resistance Against Japan, there were more than 20 sluices and no less than 75 main and branch canals, totaling about 140 li, capable of irrigating more than 380,000 mu. After more than ten years of destruction by the Japanese puppets and the Kuomintang, the sluices and canals were in disrepair, and the irrigated area gradually decreased. The local masses urgently demanded the repair of sluices and dredging of silt to restore and develop water conservancy. This spring, governments at all levels concentrated their efforts to lead the construction. First, based on the demands of the masses, feudal control methods were abolished, and unreasonable water usage systems were eliminated; such as the requirement that surplus water after irrigation must be returned to the river without expanding the irrigated area, and the conservative rule of "not irrigating land across villages," etc. Democratic water conservancy management organizations were established, and the masses were in high spirits. In the past, Chengci did not give the surplus water to Handan after irrigating its land, and the water from the Suli Sluice in Handan was not given to Yongnian. After persuasion and education by the leadership, this year Chengci irrigated more than 10,000 mu of land in more than 20 villages in Handan with the surplus water. The water from the Suli Sluice in Handan also irrigated Yongnian, with Zhoucun and Dama Village alone irrigating 70 mu. With the efforts of the farmers along the rivers in various counties, a total of 160,900 mu of land were irrigated in spring and autumn. In addition to reaching the pre-War of Resistance irrigated area of 80,000 mu, Handan and Chengci expanded paddy fields by 30,600 mu, ensuring timely sowing of thousands of hectares of fertile land, increasing wheat production, and adding more than 40 irrigated villages. Generally speaking, although the construction work in the Three Special District this spring has achieved considerable results, the leadership's attention is not enough, and there is still a lack of specialized organizations to provide unified leadership. Therefore, many canals and sluices in some counties (such as Yongnian) have not been well repaired, and the order of water usage and the phenomenon of stealing and wasting water still urgently need to be resolved.

　　[Our Newspaper] The spring repair of dangerous sections and reconstruction of dikes in the Pingnan Special District was mostly completed at the beginning of this month. The area has suffered from the devastation of enemy puppet rule in recent years, and the Daqing and Yongding Rivers under its jurisdiction are in disrepair, with the main dikes in dangerous condition and dilapidated. This year, the entire area was liberated, and the democratic government, in order to prevent floods, specially led the masses in the counties along the rivers to repair dangerous sections and reconstruct dikes. In one month, according to incomplete statistics from Gu'an, Xincheng, Xiongxian, Baxian, and other ten counties and cities, more than 5,000 zhang of dangerous sections were repaired and dikes were reconstructed, and more than 4,000 piles were driven. Gu'an and Daxing counties alone drove 420 piles, reinforced 435 bu of dangerous sections, and reconstructed 2,120 cubic meters of earthwork. In terms of the total project in the entire district, 90 percent has now been completed, and the remainder will be fully completed before the 10th of this month. The main reasons for the completion of the above projects are: (1) The Daqing and Yongding River system headquarters was established, and each river also set up an engineering section, implementing organized and planned unified leadership and specific division of labor. (2) Comprehensive planning and various preparations were carried out in advance. Inspection, measurement, and estimation of the required raw materials and man-days were done in advance, and preparations were made separately, ensuring the supply of materials, raw materials, and labor after construction began. (3) In terms of management and leadership, in addition to uniformly controlling the entire project, the headquarters also went to each section to provide specific guidance, paying attention to strengthening political education for the pile-driving teams and migrant workers in each county, calling on everyone to carry out competitions to strive for models, and mobilizing everyone to review, commend, and criticize at any time, which greatly boosted the morale of the pile-driving teams and migrant workers and improved work efficiency, and the work was done solidly and with quality materials. In addition, due to poor management of material transport vehicles and the lack of a mass perspective among individual cadres leading the vehicles, a lot of manpower and material resources were wasted. At the same time, the lack of advance planning and the small number of tools brought by the migrant workers, coupled with the fact that some migrant workers were not led by cadres, resulted in wasted time and manpower. This deserves attention.

　　冀南三专区修渠治河
  　浇地十六万亩
  　平南修险复堤大部完工
    【冀南电】冀南三专区各级政府领导沿河群众兴修水利，改善了对河水的封建管理，及不合理的使水办法，今春浇地十六万亩，保证按时播种。滏阳河穿过该区成磁、邯郸、鸡泽、永年等县，沿河群众有修闸、挖渠引水浇地的习贯，抗战前有水闸二十多道，主干、支渠不下七十五道，约百四十里，共能浇地三十八万余亩。经日伪与国民党的统治摧残，十余年闸渠失修，浇地面积逐渐减少。当地群众迫切要求修闸清淤，恢复发展水利。今春各级政府集中力量领导修建；首先根据群众要求，取消了封建性管制办法，废除不合理的使水制度；如浇地余水要放回河去也不扩大浇面，及“隔村不浇地”的保守规矩等，又以民主方式建立了水利管理组织，群众情绪很高。过去成磁浇完了地余水也不给邯郸浇，邯郸苏里闸水亦不给永年浇，经领导上说服教育，今年成磁将余水浇到邯郸二十多个村庄地一万余亩。邯郸苏里闸水也浇到永年，仅周村、大马村即浇地七十亩。在各县沿河农民努力下，春秋共浇地十六万零九百余亩。邯郸、成磁除达抗战前浇地八万亩的面积外，扩大水田三万零六百亩，保证千顷良田按时播种，增加麦子产量，新添四十多浇地村。总观三专区今春修建工作，虽有相当成绩，但领导上重视还不够，还缺少专门组织来统一领导，因此有的县（如永年）好多渠、闸还未很好修理，使水次序、偷水扔水现象仍迫切需要解决。
    【本报讯】平南专区的春季修险复堤工程，本月初已大部竣工。该区数年来遭敌伪统治摧残，所属大清、永定各河流均失修，大堤险工残破不堪。今年全区解放，民主政府为防御水患，特领导沿河各县群众进行修险复堤，在一个月中，据固安、新城、雄县、霸县等十县市的不完全统计，修险复堤五千余丈，打桩四千余棵。仅固安、大兴两县共打桩四百二十棵，厢四百三十五步的险工，并复堤土方二千一百二十方。按全区总工程来说，现已完成百分之九十，其余本月十号前即全部完成。能够完成以上工程的原因，主要为：（一）成立了大清、永定两河系指挥部，各河又设立了工务段，实行了有组织有计划的统一领导和具体分工。（二）事先进行了全面计划和各种准备工作。事先检查、测量，预定出所需用的原料、工数，分头准备，保证了动工后器材、原料、人工等之供应。（三）在管理领导上，指挥部除统一掌握全部工程外，并分头到各段进行具体指导，注意照顾各县桩班和民工的加强政治教育，号召大家开展竞赛，争取模范，随时发动大家检讨，进行表扬批评，大大鼓舞了各桩班和民工们的情绪，提高了工作效率，而且作的活土坚料实。另外在运输材料车上由于管理不好，以及个别带领大车干部缺乏群众观点而浪费不少人力物力。同时事先的计划性不足，民工带的工具少，加上有的民工没干部带领，以致耽误时间浪费人力。值得注意。
