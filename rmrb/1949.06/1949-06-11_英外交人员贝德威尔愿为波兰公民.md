　　Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 10th: TASS, Warsaw, 6th: George Bedwell, head of the British Council in Poland (Note: This committee is under the British Foreign Office), has requested the Polish Ministry of Internal Affairs that he wishes to renounce his British nationality and obtain Polish citizenship. He has notified London of his resignation and hopes to remain in Poland and work in Poland.
　　Bedwell stated in a written statement that during his three and a half years of residence in Poland, he was "convinced that the Polish government, supported by the people, is expecting peace, demanding peace, and fighting for peace." Bedwell wrote: Poland's entire policy is determined by the need to ensure lasting peace, maintain national sovereignty, and defend Poland's current rational borders. The attitude of the Polish authorities towards the "British Council" in Poland has irrefutably proven that there is no so-called "Iron Curtain" between Poland and Western Europe. Poland's attitude towards the representatives of British and French culture clearly shows that Poland expects cultural cooperation. In Poland's policies, in its covenants with neighboring countries, I have not seen any signs of aggressive intent, which is quite the opposite of what the Western countries - participants of the North Atlantic Treaty - have repeatedly stated.

　　Unwilling to be an accomplice of imperialism, hoping to be in the peace camp
　　Bedwell continued: "While I observed the development of Polish policy with admiration, I also noticed the conspiracy obviously used by Western countries under the hypnotic influence of money. Contrary to the British people's struggle for peace, Bevin is now turning Britain into a vassal state, falling into the alliance led by the evil American imperialism." British voters are being angered by the capitalist bosses' slander campaign against the Communist Party. While deceiving the people, the British government and diplomatic corps "are trying to interfere in the internal affairs of other countries."
　　Bedwell said that all of this made him feel "fear and disgust," so he was unwilling to be an accomplice of imperialism, but hoped to be in the peace camp. The Polish Ministry of Internal Affairs has accepted Bedwell as a Polish citizen.

　　英外交人员贝德威尔
  　愿为波兰公民
    【新华社北平十日电】据塔斯社华沙六日讯：英国在波兰的“英国委员会”主任乔治·贝德威尔（按：该委员会隶属于英国外交部）向波兰内政部请求称：他希望放弃英国国籍，并取得波兰公民籍。他已通知伦敦，辞去职务，并希望留居波兰及在波兰工作。
    贝德威尔发表书面声明称：在他留居波兰三年半期间，他“确信为人民所拥护的波兰政府，是期望和平，要求和平，并为争取和平而斗争的”。贝德威尔写道：波兰的全部政策，是以必须确保持久的和平，保持民族的主权，保卫波兰现在的合理的边疆来决定的。波兰当局对在波兰的“英国委员会”的态度，业已不可驳辩的证明了：波兰与西欧之间并没有所谓“铁幕”存在。波兰对英法文化代表们的态度，清楚地说明了波兰期望文化的合作。在波兰的政策中，在它与邻国的协约中，我没有看到任何侵略意图的迹象，这与西方国家——北大西洋公约的参加者所加重申说的恰恰相反。
    不愿充当帝国主义的鹰犬希望置身于和平阵营
    贝德威尔继续写道：“当我以钦佩的心情观察波兰政策发展的时候，我也注意到西方国家在金元催眠性影响下所明显使用的阴谋。与英国人民进行争取和平的斗争相反，贝文现正把英国变为附庸国，堕入罪恶的美帝国主义所领导的联盟里去。”英国选民正为资本家头子对共产党的诽谤行动所激怒。与欺骗人民同时，英国政府和外交团“力图干涉其他国家的内政”。
    贝德威尔称：所有这一切使他感到“恐惧与憎恶”，因此不愿充当帝国主义的鹰犬，而希望置身于和平阵营。波兰内政部已接受贝德威尔为波兰公民。
