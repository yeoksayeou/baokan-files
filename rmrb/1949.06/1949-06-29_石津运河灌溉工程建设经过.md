　　Construction Process of the Shijin Canal Irrigation Project
    Zhang Zilin
    The Shijin Canal irrigation project was initiated after the liberation of Shijiazhuang, under the active advocacy of Comrade Song Shaowen, Director of the former Shanxi-Chahar-Hebei Border Region Administrative Committee, to renovate the existing irrigation infrastructure. At that time, the former Transportation Management Bureau conducted surveys and planning. Later, encouraged by Director Dong, the project was further developed. All comrades involved in surveying and planning were greatly encouraged and formulated a two-year plan. This plan was approved by the North China People's Government Administration Committee, which instructed the Agricultural Department's Farmland Water Conservancy Office to organize a construction team. Wang Chengzhou, a supervisory commissioner of the Supervision Bureau, was appointed as chief engineer, and Comrade Zhang Dianzhen as engineer. Construction began immediately, aiming to start irrigation within a year. This project was directly led by the Agricultural Department of the North China People's Government. In November of last year, work began on four branch canals. In just twenty days, 35 kilometers of canals were completed, with 230,000 cubic meters of earthwork excavated. In the latter half of March this year, construction of canal structures began. By the first half of May, in less than two months, the planned 113 major and minor structures were completed, including a reinforced concrete aqueduct, highway bridges, diversion gates, stone bridges, brick arch bridges, water gates, large and small drop structures, tailwater slopes, and a reinforced concrete bridge over the railway. A temporary river dam of 390 meters long with wooden piles and sunken bundles was also constructed, along with nine large sluice gates and hoists, four medium-sized sluice gates and hoists, and 34 small sluice gates. 20,000 cubic meters of silt were flushed and excavated from the tunnel, using over 93,000 workdays and costing approximately 15,000 shi of rice. The vast majority of workers and farmers participating in the work demonstrated high enthusiasm. Many people worked tirelessly day and night in waist-deep water to overcome the silt in the tunnel. Many cadres of the engineering office also worked alongside the workers, persisting for twenty days. Workers from the Transportation Factory launched a campaign to manufacture sluice gate hoists in order not to delay the water supply. The Dunshun team of Qiantai Baozhuang, the Shanghuangbi Village of Huolu, and the Shijiazhuang contractor joint team not only had a good work attitude, but also completed the work according to engineering standards. Other cadres of the engineering office generally worked with the workers at all times, helping them to find ways to save labor and materials. The chief engineer, engineer, and Comrade Shen Xianlun, one of the persons in charge, as well as comrades from the construction station, inspected the construction site every day, leading and helping to educate workers to achieve standardization as much as possible. Due to the above reasons, the first phase of the project was completed relatively satisfactorily. Water has already been supplied for irrigation, and the project is relatively solid and durable. It is expected that after future consolidation and extension of the canal line, the 200,000-mu irrigation plan can be realized.
    This project was carried out under extremely difficult conditions. Firstly, there was an insufficient number of cadres and the technical level was not high. We mainly relied on students from water conservancy colleges and newly graduated or not-yet-graduated university students from the liberated areas of Peiping and Tianjin, initially only about twenty people. In terms of equipment, there was no foundation at all. The pile driver was borrowed, the instruments were temporarily from the water conservancy college, and the tools were purchased temporarily. The Kuomintang era had long since embezzled and distributed the original Shijin Canal assets. Transportation was even more out of the question, with only three horse-drawn carriages available. In addition, there were even more difficulties encountered in the project, especially the silt in the tunnel, which could not be excavated or flushed, almost causing the water release to fail. However, all these difficulties were overcome by all cadres, who came up with solutions, repeatedly researched and discussed, learned from each other, and competed with each other, using our Party's traditional spirit of tackling problems, and tirelessly fighting against nature. Moreover, the construction period only took half a year from start to finish. This is just as Professors Tang Maoru and Liu Wenxiu of Peking University said at the water release ceremony: "We are very honored to participate in such a celebration of the project's victory here in Shijiazhuang. We know that the People's Liberation War is still going on, but the North China Liberated Area has already drawn strength to engage in water conservancy construction, and the speed of construction is so fast. This is truly impossible without the leadership of the Communist Party, the People's Government, and the greatness of the people's power."
    Why were we able to quickly complete the planned project under extremely difficult conditions? First of all, we relied on the power of the people. All kinds of engineering work, earthwork, and cement work were contracted to the local people. Through the local Party and local government, the masses were mobilized and organized into contracting teams. Because of their vested interests and political awareness, they worked with enthusiasm and responsibility. Many women also participated. Old Man Liu of Xili Village mobilized his whole family to work, and for several days they worked until 9 p.m. before stopping, for which they were rewarded. To transport tens of thousands of bags of cement and thousands of cubic meters of sand and gravel, the masses organized thousands of carts, which transported the materials back and forth all day long, solving the difficulty of transportation. This great scene helped the project to proceed rapidly.
    Secondly, the timely leadership of the People's Government and the great support of the North China Financial and Economic Commission in terms of funding. After reviewing the plan and engineering design, the funds were allocated in full at one time, and as a result, the project costs were still one million jin of rice less than the allocated budget. The reason for this was that the Ministry of Industry and Commerce helped to purchase cement and meticulously organized the transportation work, saving 500,000 jin of rice. In overcoming the silt in the tunnel project, the hard work of the cadres and workers, who persisted in the struggle for twenty days and nights, saved 300,000 jin of rice. In addition, three control gate projects were left for later, with 200,000 jin not used.
    In addition, the close cooperation of various departments also provided great help. The People's Bank provided full convenience in terms of loans. In terms of the allocation of cadres, the North China Highway Bureau, the Jianping Prefecture, and especially the North China Water Conservancy Commission, not only solved the difficulty of insufficient cadres, but also provided concrete technical assistance.
    For this large project, we adopted the construction policy of state-owned enterprises, with the state providing loans for construction, and in the future, water fees will be collected, and water will be used to nourish water, expanding the reconstruction. During construction, allowing the masses to participate in the work can solve part of the spring famine problem. All projects are based on the contracting system, which can further give play to the enthusiasm of the masses. Compensation is paid at market prices for land occupation and damage to wheat field seeds and fertilizers, so the masses are very supportive.
    The above are a few basic experiences, but there are many shortcomings in the project. The dam is not permanent; there are many bends in the canal due to avoiding graves and wells; the organizational leadership is not sound enough, the system is not perfect, and the organizational and technical capabilities need to be enriched and improved. At the same time, this project is only the beginning. Our goal is to develop the irrigation of one million mu of cotton fields. We hope that relevant departments and water conservancy experts will give us strong assistance and guidance! (Attached picture)

　　石津运河灌溉工程建设经过
    张子林
    石津运河的灌溉工程是自石家庄解放后，在原晋察冀边区行政委员会主任宋劭文同志积极倡议下，利用原有工程基础，改修灌溉工程。当时由原交通管理局勘察计划，去年六月开始测量，中途又得到董主任的鼓励，并要求更进一步发展。全体参加测量及计划的同志们都大为振奋，遂拟制了二年计划。经由华北人民政府政务委员会通过，并责成农业部农田水利处组织工程处。并派监察院监察委员王承周兼任总工程师，张殿珍同志担任工程师，即日施工，争取一年内放水灌溉。这一工程就在华北人民政府农业部直接领导下，在去年十一月开始先开四条支渠，只二十天便完成渠道三十五公里，挖土方二十三万公方。到今年三月后半月开始渠道建筑物施工。至五月前半月，不到两个月的时间，完成所计划的洋灰大渡槽、公路桥、分水闸、砌石桥、砖拱桥、水门、大小跌水、退水坡、过铁路洋灰桥等大小一百一十三件建筑物。并筑木桩沉梱三百九十米的临时拦河坝一个，大闸门及起闸器各九个，中型闸门及起闸器各四个，小型闸门三十四个。冲掘隧道中淤泥两万方共用工九万三千多，工程费约一万五千石米。绝大部分参加作工的工人、农民都表现了高度热情，很多群众为了克服隧道中淤泥，昼夜不停的在水深没腰的情况下工作；工程处的许多干部也同样与工人在一起坚持了二十天。交通工厂工人为了不误上水，全厂工人突击制造起闸器，前太保庄敦顺小组、获鹿上黄壁村和石家庄包工友联小组，不仅工作态度好，而且都能按工程标准完成。工程处的其他干部，一般都作到时时和工人在一起，帮助工人想如何省工省料的法子。总工程师、工程师及负责人之一的沈现纶同志及施工所同志等都每天在工地检查，领导帮助与教育工人尽量做到标准化。由于以上原因，第一期工程比较完满完成，已经开始上水浇地，而且工程也比较坚固耐久。预计经过今后整理，引长渠线，二十万亩的灌溉计划，是可以实现的。
    此项工程，是在极端困难的条件下进行的，首先是干部数量不足，技术水平不高，我们是以水专的同学及刚从平津来解放区的才毕业的或尚未毕业的大学同学为主体，最初只二十来个人；器材方面根本没有基础，打桩机是借来的，仪器是暂用水专的，工具临时才购置的，国民党时代早已将原石津运河的东西贪污分散了；交通运输工具，更谈不到，只有三辆马车。另外在工程上随时遇的困难更多，特别是隧道里的淤泥，掘不出，冲不动，几乎使放水失败。但这种种困难，都经全体干部，大家来想办法，反复研究讨论，互相学习、竞赛，用我党的传统突击精神，不疲倦的对自然作斗争，都一一被克服了。而且施工期间，前后只用了半年。这正象在放水典礼上，北大教授汤茂如、刘文修两先生所说的：“我们这次来石家庄，参加了这样一个庆祝工程胜利会，感到非常光荣，我们知道人民解放战争还在进行，华北解放区早已抽出力量来搞水利建设，而且建设的速度竞这样的快，这真是除非有共产党，人民政府的领导，及人民力量的伟大，是不能办到的”。
    我们为什么在万分困难条件下能迅速的完成所计划的工程呢？首先是依靠了人民的力量：各种工程，土工、洋灰工，都交给当地人民来做，通过地方党，地方政府，发动群众，组织起包工队来，而他们由于切身利益及政治觉悟，劳动起来，真是热情而负责，不少的妇女也参加了，西里村刘老汉动员全家做工，曾经有几天做到晚九点才收工，得到了奖励。为运万袋洋灰，几千方的沙子石子，群众组织了成千辆大车，整日往返运送，解决了交通工具的困难，这种伟大的场面，帮助了工程的迅速的进行。
    其次是人民政府的及时领导，华北财委会在经费上给与了极大支持，在审查了计划与工程设计后，一次全部拨发，而结果工程费用尚节余了一百万斤米。原因是工商部帮助购买洋灰精细地组织了运输工作，节省了五十万斤米；在克服隧道中淤泥工程，由于干部工人坚苦的坚持二十昼夜的斗争，节省了三十万斤米。另有三个节制闸工程留在以后做，二十万斤未用。
    另外，是各部门的密切合作，也给了很大帮助，人民银行在贷款上，充分予以便利；在干部配备方面，华北公路总局，建屏专署，特别是华北水利委员会，不仅是解决了干部不足的困难，而且也具体的给予技术上的帮助。
    这一较大的工程，我们是采取国营企业的建设方针，由国家贷款建设，将来收取水费，并以水养水，扩大再建设。在建设当中，群众参加做工，可以解决一部分春荒问题。一切工程均取包工制，更可发挥群众的积极性；占地，及损害麦地的种子肥料都照市价发给，这样群众是十分拥护的。
    以上是几点基本经验，但工程的缺点是很多的，坝堰还不是永久性的；渠道因躲坟躲井，弯曲处很多；组织领导上还不够健全，制度不够完善，组织能力与技术能力都急待充实和提高；同时这一工程也才是开始，我们的目标是发展百万亩的棉田灌溉，望有关部门及水利专家们，给以大力援助与指导！（附图片）
