Xinhua News Agency, Wuxi, 1st. To celebrate the liberation of Shanghai, workers at the Qishuyan Railway Machinery Plant on the Beijing-Shanghai line named an armored train they had finished repairing on the eve of Shanghai's liberation the "Shanghai." This train was captured by the People's Liberation Army on the Beijing-Shanghai front. The locomotive and eight carriages had more than 600 bullet holes from machine guns, and many parts were also damaged. The workers were very excited to hear the news of the liberation of Shanghai's urban area and rushed to repair it overnight. The freight car workshop concentrated all the electric welding machines to work. Several foremen who did not directly participate in labor in the past also started working themselves. More than 60 workers worked continuously for fifteen and a half hours to rush the repair of the train. Under this intense rush repair, the armored train was repaired from the afternoon of the 23rd to the 26th.

　　戚墅堰铁路职工修复“上海号”
    【新华社无锡一日电】京沪路上戚墅堰铁路机厂职工，为庆祝上海解放，将在上海解放前夕加工修好的一列铁甲列车，命名为“上海号”。该列车是解放军在京沪前线缴获的，机车和八辆车箱被机枪打了六百多个洞，零件也损毁很多。工人们由于听到上海市区解放的消息，非常兴奋，连夜赶修。货车工场把所有电焊机全部集中起来工作。过去不直接参加劳动的几个领班也亲自动起手来。有六十多个工人为赶修列车而连续工作了十五个半钟头。在这种紧张的抢修下，该铁甲列车自二十三日下午至二十六日即告修竣。
