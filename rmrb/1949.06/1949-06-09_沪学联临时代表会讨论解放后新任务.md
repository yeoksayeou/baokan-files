Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, July 7th. The Shanghai Student Federation held its first Provisional Representative Conference since liberation on the afternoon of the 3rd at Nanyang Model High School to discuss the new tasks of Shanghai students after the liberation of Shanghai. Attendees included representatives from 209 units, including Jiaotong University, Fudan University, Jinan University, Tongji University, and St. John's University, representing over 92,000 students. Dai Baitao, Deputy Director of the Cultural and Educational Management Committee of the Shanghai Military Control Commission, and Li Chang, member of the Central Committee of the New Democratic Youth League, were also invited to participate. The conference began with an opening speech by Chairman Zhang Yumin, who said: During its underground activities, the Shanghai Student Federation suffered all kinds of devastation and suppression by the Kuomintang reactionary government through special criminal courts, flying fortresses, and secret agents. However, the students were not crushed; on the contrary, they were tempered and became stronger. He then pointed out: In the past, the task of the Student Federation's struggle was to oppose imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism, and to demand freedom and liberation. Today, the new task in the new situation is to intensify study, enrich and transform ourselves, unite all Shanghai students, closely integrate with the workers and peasants, participate in the construction of the new China, and serve the people. In his speech, Li Chang put forward the current specific tasks for Shanghai youth and students: to strengthen study, especially political study; to make preliminary improvements to school measures, establish conscious study discipline and good school order; at the same time, to raise vigilance and pay attention to fighting against hidden enemies who have gone underground; and the mode of activity should shift from secret to open, from dispersed to centralized, and from small groups to collective mass activities. The conference also invited Chen Zhenzhong, the Shanghai Student Federation representative to the Vice-Chairman of the All-China Student Federation, to speak. He briefly reported on the proceedings of the 14th All-China Student Congress held in Beiping, and said: The students in the vast liberated areas have great respect and expectations for the Shanghai students who have a glorious history of struggle, and hope that the Shanghai students will share their work experience with everyone. Afterwards, the Secretariat of the Shanghai Student Federation reported on the history of the Shanghai student struggle and the work of the Student Federation over the past three and a half years. Finally, the conference adopted a number of resolutions on association affairs.
