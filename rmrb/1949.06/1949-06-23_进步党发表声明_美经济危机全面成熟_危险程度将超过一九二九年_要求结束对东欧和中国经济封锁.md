    Xinhua News Agency, Beiping, 22nd -- TASS, New York, 19th: The National Committee of the American Progressive Party issued a statement declaring that "a fully matured economic crisis is descending upon the United States," and pointed out that this crisis, in terms of its danger, will surpass that of 1929. The statement then condemned "the government, Congress, newspapers, and monopoly capitalists for using a conspiracy of 'keeping silent and talking nonsense' to hide the fact that their policies have brought the country into the initial stages of an economic crisis."

    The statement pointed out: The number of unemployed people in the United States has reached five million. If the current trend continues in the American economy, the number of unemployed will reach ten million in the winter. The increasing unemployment and reduced production have been accelerating in the past six months and are taking on the same international nature as in 1929-1932.

    The statement pointed out that the reduction in production has expanded from the consumer goods industry to basic industries, and emphasized that steel production in June has fallen to 86 percent (which is the lowest point in ten years). The statement said: Mass unemployment is already very acute in the northwestern states, Tennessee, and the West Coast. Under current laws, two out of every five workers are not eligible for unemployment insurance.

    进步党发表声明
    美经济危机全面成熟
    危险程度将超过一九二九年
    要求结束对东欧和中国经济封锁
    【新华社北平二十二日电】塔斯社纽约十九日讯，美国进步党全国委员会发表声明，宣告“全面成熟的经济危机正降临美国”，并指出这次危机在危险程度上与一九二九年相较，将有过之而无不及。声明继即谴责“政府、国会、报纸和垄断资本家用‘闭口不谈和胡说八道’的阴谋，来掩藏他们的政策已把国家带进了经济危机的初期阶段”。
    声明指出：美国失业人数已达五百万，如果目前的趋势在美国经济中继续下去，则冬天失业人数将达一千万。日益增加的失业和降低的生产，在过去六个月中，正加速地继续发展着，并且正具有一九二九——三二年那样的国际性质。
    声明指出生产降低已从消费品工业扩展到基本工业，并强调钢的生产在六月份已降至百分之八十六（按这是十年来的最低点）。声明说：大量失业在西北部各州、田纳西和西岸已经甚为尖锐。在现行法律之下，每五个工人中即有两个没有资格取得失业保险金。
