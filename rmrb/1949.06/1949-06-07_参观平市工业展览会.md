Visiting the Ping City Industrial Exhibition
    Our Correspondent
    In the Peiping City Industrial Exhibition, people saw the brilliant tomorrow of the new China.

    The most attractive to visitors were the various agricultural machines displayed in the front yard of Zhongshan Hall, including ten-row seeders, threshers, ox-drawn plows, hay cutters, and "irrigation pumps" capable of pumping 140 tons of water per hour... These were all manufactured by the North China Agricultural Machinery Factory. -- The transformation of this factory illustrates the great change taking place in China. It was originally a "repair shop" used by the Kuomintang reactionaries to manufacture artillery for slaughtering the Chinese people. After liberation, it was taken over and transformed by the People's Government into an agricultural machinery manufacturing factory serving peaceful construction and the people. A large number of agricultural machines will supply the needs of state-owned farms and the vast countryside, gradually pushing the scattered individual economy towards collectivization; in return, it will provide urban industrial production with ample raw materials.

    Secondly, the thousands of industrial products displayed in the ten exhibition rooms of Zhongshan Hall and the Peiping National Library Reading Room illustrate the breadth of the path taken by Peiping's industry after liberation. From the explanations and charts of the production situation of various participating factories, it can be seen that in the four months since liberation, the city's industrial production level has already surpassed the level before the Kuomintang reactionaries' price controls on August 19th of last year, and is continuing to rise. The explanatory table of Huaxing Dyeing and Weaving Factory pointed out the reasons for this rise: After liberation, there was no oppression from imperialism and bureaucratic capital; under the New Democratic industrial construction policy, the output of Huaxing Dyeing and Weaving Factory's dyeing workshop in May, with the help of the National Trading Company, exceeded the total output of 1947 and 1948 during the Kuomintang reactionary rule. As Mayor Ye Jianying said at the opening ceremony of the exhibition: "We will overcome the many difficulties left over by the anti-people's war launched by the Kuomintang reactionaries."

    The retreaded tires of Xinhua Rubber Factory, the pontoons for military bridging, the rolled paper of Yanjing Paper Mill, the light waterwheels and various machine tools manufactured by the Advanced Industrial Vocational School, the flasks, chemical instruments and various test tubes manufactured by the newly built Glass Factory, and the transformers, motors and various machine parts manufactured by the Electrical Engineering Equipment Factory displayed in the Telecommunications Industry Exhibition Hall, all gave the audience great joy and excitement.

    Everyone saw hope and a bright tomorrow here. At that time, tractors will be running in the fertile fields of the motherland, tall chimneys will stand tall, and telecommunications and transportation will connect all our people together.

　　参观平市工业展览会
    本报记者
    在北平市工业展览会里，人们看见了新中国的灿烂的明天。
    最能吸引着参观者的是陈列在中山堂前院子里的各种农业机器，有十行播种机、脱粒机、牛耕机、轧草机，每小时能抽水一百四十吨的“灌溉水泵”……这些都是华北农业机器厂制造的。——这个机器厂的变化，说明了中国正在大转变，它原来是国民党反动派专为制造屠杀中国人民炮火的“修械所”，解放后被人民政府接管改造成为和平建设服务人民的农业机器制造厂。大批的农业机器将供应国营农场与广大农村的需要，将分散的个体经济，逐渐推向集体化的道路；反过来它又将给城市工业生产以充足的原料。
    其次是中山堂、北平国立图书馆阅览室十个展览室陈列的数千件工业产品，它们说明了解放后北平工业所走道路的宽广。从各个参加展览的工厂生产情况的说明和图表上可以看出：解放四个月来，全市工业的生产水平，已经超过去年“八、一九”国民党反动派限价前的水平，而且在继续高涨着。华兴染织厂展览的说明表上，指出了这种高涨的原因：解放后，没有帝国主义、官僚资本的压迫；在新民主主义工业建设方针下，五月份华兴染织厂的染厂产量，在国家贸易公司扶助下超过了国民党反动派统治时一九四七、四八两年产量的总和。这正如叶剑英市长在展览会开幕典礼上说的：“国民党反动派所发动的反人民战争遗留下的许多困难，我们都会克服的。”
    新华橡胶厂翻新的车胎、军用架桥的浮囊、燕京造纸厂的卷筒纸、高级工业职业学校制造的轻便水车和各种机床，新建玻璃厂制造的烧瓶、化学仪器及各种试验管，以及电讯工业展览室里陈列着的电工器材厂制造的变压器、电动机和各种机件，都给观众以莫大的喜悦与兴奋。
    每个人从这里看见了希望，看见了灿烂的明天。那时拖拉机将在祖国肥沃的田野里奔驰，高大的烟囱林立，而电讯交通又把我们全国人民联系在一起。
