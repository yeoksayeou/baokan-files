  　Several Opinions on Rural Loans
    Last year's rural loan work, due to the correction of the purely relief viewpoint, the granting viewpoint, and other biases, and the serious study of loan methods, played a considerable role in supporting rural production and enlivening financial circulation; moreover, it achieved lending based on solid guarantees, expanded agricultural loan funds, and increased the state's power to support production. Based on the development of rural loan work over the past year, the following opinions are put forward as a reference for future work:

　　Combining Loans with Supply, Marketing, and Production
    Due to the lack of materials in rural areas, if large amounts of loans are not combined with the adjustment of material supply and marketing and the development of production to balance supply and demand, then the prices of production materials that the masses commonly need at that time (such as plows and livestock, fertilizers, sickles during harvesting, etc.) will rise. This will not only increase the difficulty for farmers who do not receive loans to purchase production materials, but also greatly reduce the effect of loans. For example, the production promotion cooperatives in six counties of the 11th sub-district of central Hebei made or bought waterwheels, dippers, and farm tools with 280,000 yuan of loans, and then lent them to the masses, which was very popular. When planting wheat last autumn, the bank of the third special district office of the Bohai District in Shandong entrusted the promotion cooperative to transfer 700,000 jin of soybean cake for lending, which eliminated the phenomenon of rising soybean cake prices during wheat planting in previous years, greatly stabilized fertilizer prices, ensured that the masses directly obtained production materials, reduced purchase and transportation difficulties, and enabled loans to be truly used for production. However, attention should be paid when using loans to manufacture or purchase agricultural tools and fertilizers: (1) Suit the habits of the masses, and the purchased agricultural tools must be suitable. In the past, the agricultural tools we purchased were often not suitable in style, and the masses would rather borrow money to buy them themselves than borrow the agricultural tools we purchased; (2) Purchase and transport them from afar. If the task is only assigned to stores or promotion cooperatives and cooperatives to purchase locally, the goal of stabilizing prices will still not be achieved; (3) Lend what is needed. For example, when Bohai lent spring wheat seeds last spring, what was lent was wheat. The masses had to sell wheat and then buy barley, which greatly increased the price of barley; (4) No matter what is lent, it should be converted into the masses' products for repayment (such as lending agricultural tools to repay grain or lending cotton to collect cloth, etc.). In this way, the bank can not only guarantee capital, but also avoid the masses being exploited again when selling their products.

    Establish a Unified Leadership Structure
    According to the experience of North China, the trade companies, banks, and cooperative departments at the county level in various places should be unified to form a production promotion cooperative. The promotion cooperative should uniformly control loans, supply and marketing, and tool manufacturing, and develop rural cooperative mutual aid organizations through agricultural loans and supply and marketing work. Under the leadership of the county production promotion cooperative, district joint cooperatives are set up in districts, and village cooperatives are set up in villages, forming a systematic and unified leadership structure. When banks at the county level adjust funds and trade companies adjust materials, they are all combined with village cooperatives and the broad masses through the production promotion cooperative, making it easier for cooperatives to develop due to frequent assistance; at the same time, the organization is simple, saving cadres and expenses, and avoiding uncoordinated contradictions in lending, supply and marketing, and organizing mass production. For example, the production promotion cooperatives in central Hebei and the former northern Yue counties have closely combined agricultural loan work with raw material and tool supply, product sales, and the three tasks of organizing mass mutual assistance and cooperation, which has played a significant role in promoting production. In the first half of last year, they achieved the following results: (1) According to the needs of the masses, purchase physical objects with loans and lend them to the masses. For example, the promotion cooperative in Hunyuan County used loans to purchase 37 shi and 4 dou of rice seeds, 19 livestock, 705 small hoes, and 22 small carts and lent them out to solve the production difficulties of the masses. (2) Organize the masses to develop production through agricultural loans. For example, the promotion cooperatives in Wangdu, Wanxian, and other counties lent waterwheels to organize the masses to cooperate in digging wells; the Hejian promotion cooperative used loans to support 36 villages to organize 83 groups to carry out weaving, spinning, planting yam seedlings, and weaving (weaving baskets and mats, etc.) production. (3) Distribute loans at any time according to the agricultural season and the needs of the masses, recover them on time, and establish an inspection system, so that agricultural loans can continuously organize mass production, overcoming the problems caused by the past practice of issuing and recovering loans in a rush.

　　Establish Village Cooperative Credit Business and Develop Rural Lending
    At present, there are few lending relationships in rural areas, which is greatly detrimental to production. Not only is the amount of state agricultural loans small, but also if there is no credit institution closely related to the masses in rural areas, it is difficult to make state loans completely reasonable. For example, Zhang Xigui, a cooperative hero in Nanhedi Village, Wu'an, Taihang District, founded a credit cooperative for physical deposits in 1948, absorbing 3,700 jin of millet and 3,000 jin of corn. In six months, a total of 13,085 jin of grain was lent out. By organizing transportation through loans, each household earned 20,000 to 30,000 yuan to 60,000 to 70,000 yuan, and depositors also guaranteed their capital and received profits. In terms of lending methods, the cooperative is closely integrated with administrative, peasant associations, and production teams. Each loan is democratically discussed in the production team in the form of self-reporting and public deliberation, and then reviewed and approved by the village head and peasant association chairman, and the masses supervise the use of the loan by the loan household and whether it is returned on time, correcting the phenomenon that occurred in the past when banks lent to vagrants and speculators due to a lack of cadres and understanding of the situation, and also correcting the situation where a large number of loans could not be recovered due to the granting viewpoint of cadres.

### 关于农村贷款的几点意见

  　关于农村贷款的几点意见
    去年的农村贷款工作，由于纠正了单纯救济观点、恩赐观点等偏向，认真研究了贷放方式，对扶持农村生产、活跃金融流通上，都起了相当的作用；而且作到了贷实保本，扩大了农贷资金，增加了国家扶持生产的力量。根据一年来农村贷款工作的发展，兹提出以下几个意见，作为今后工作中的参考：
　　贷款与供销生产相结合
    由于农村物资缺乏，如果大量贷款不与调剂物资供销和发展生产相结合，以平衡供求数量，那末，当时群众所共同需要的生产资料（如犁和牲畜，肥料，收割时的镰刀等）的价格，便会上涨，这样不但增加了不贷款的农民购买生产资料的困难，而且也大大降低了贷款作用。如冀中十一分区六个县的生产推进社，把二十八万万元的贷款，都制成或买来水车、斗子、农具等，再贷给群众，颇受欢迎。去秋种麦时山东渤海区三专署的银行，以贷款委托推进社调运豆饼七十万斤出贷，免除了历年种麦时豆饼价格上涨的现象，大大的平抑了肥料的价格，保障群众直接取得生产资料，减少购运困难，使贷款真正能用之于生产。但以贷款制造或购买农具肥料时应注意：（一）适合群众习惯，购买的农具要合用。过去我们所购农具往往式样不合，群众宁愿贷款自己去买，而不愿贷我们购买的农具；（二）要由远地购运，如果只把任务分配给商店或推进社、合作社就地购买，仍然达不到平抑价格的目的；（三）用什么贷什么。如去春渤海贷春麦种子时，贷的是小麦，群众必须卖了小麦再买大麦，致使大麦价格大大提高；（四）无论贷什么，均折合成群众的生产品归还（如贷农具还粮食或贷棉收布等），这样银行既能保本，同时也免得群众出卖生产品再受一次剥削。
    建立一元化的领导机构
    根据华北的经验，把各地县一级的贸易公司、银行及合作部门统一起来，成立生产推进社。由推进社统一掌握贷款、供销及工具制造，并通过农贷及供销工作，发展农村合作互助组织。在县生产推进社领导下，区设区联社，村有村合作社，成为一套有系统的一元化的领导机构。在县一级银行调剂资金，贸易公司调剂物资时，都通过生产推进社而与村合作社以及广大群众结合起来，使合作社因经常得到帮助而易于发展；同时机构简单，节省干部及经费开支，并可避免贷款、供销及组织群众生产中不协调的矛盾现象。如冀中及原北狱各县生产推进社由于把农贷工作与原料、工具供应，产品推销，及组织群众互助合作的三套工作紧密结合起来，对推进生产起了重大的作用，在去年上半年曾获得以下成绩：（一）根据群众需要，以贷款购成实物，去贷给群众，如浑源县的推进社用贷款购稻种三十七石四斗，牲口十九头，小锄七百零五个，小车二十二辆，贷出去，解决群众生产困难。（二）通过农贷组织群众发展生产，如望都、完县等县推进社贷出水车组织群众合作打井；河间推进社以贷款扶助三十六村组织成八十三个小组进行织布、纺线、下山药秧、编制（编筐编席等）等生产。（三）根据农业季节，及群众需要，随时发放，按时收回，建立检查制度，使农贷川流不息的组织群众生产，克服了过去突击发放、突击收回所产生的毛病。
　　建立村社信用业务，发展农村借贷
    目前农村借贷关系较少，这对生产大大不利。国家农贷不仅数量少，而且如果农村没有与群众密切联系的信用机关，也很难使国家贷款贷的完全合理。如太行区武安南河底村合作英雄张喜贵一九四八年创办了实物存款的信用合作社，吸收存粮小米三千七百斤，玉米三千斤，六个月累计共贷出粮一万三千零八十五斤，通过贷款组织运输，每户赚钱两、三万元至六、七万元，存户也保了本，得了利。在借贷方式上合作社与行政、农会、生产小组密切结合，每次货款，都以自报公议的方式，在生产小组进行民主讨论，再经村长、农会长审查同意，并由群众监督贷款户的用途和是否按期归还，纠正了过去银行由于干部少，及不了解情况而发生贷给二流子、投机商人的现象，也纠正了由于干部的恩赐观点而发生的有贷无还，使大批贷款收不回来的情形。
