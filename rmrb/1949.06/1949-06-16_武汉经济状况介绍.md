Introduction to Wuhan's Economic Situation
　　廖季立

Wuhan is located in the center of China's mainland. Going north along the Han River, one can reach Shaanxi and Gansu; going west along the Yangtze River via Shashi and Yichang, one can reach Sichuan; going east along the Yangtze River via Jiangxi, Anhui, and Jiangsu, one can reach Shanghai; going along the Xiang River and Yuan River, one can reach Hunan and Guizhou. Wuhan also controls the center of the national railway, going north along the Pinghan Railway through Henan, Hebei, Pingjin (Beijing and Tianjin), one can directly reach the Northeast; going south along the Yuehan Railway, one can reach Guangdong and Hong Kong. It has been known as the "thoroughfare of nine provinces" since ancient times. Due to its superior location, Wuhan, especially Hankou, has become one of the five major commercial ports in the country. Before the War of Resistance Against Japan, according to the 1936 statistics, Hankou's domestic trade ranked second among the five major commercial ports (Shanghai, Tianjin, Guangzhou, Qingdao, Hankou). The annual cotton collection in Hankou reached 2 million dan (1 dan = 50 kg), accounting for 75% of the cotton produced in Hubei, which ranked first in the country. The annual wheat collection accounted for 52% of the total sales volume of the three provinces of Hubei, Henan, and Hunan. Although foreign trade was not as good as Shanghai, Tianjin, Guangzhou, and Qingdao, Hankou was one of the three major tea markets in terms of tea; in terms of tung oil, the export volume through Hankou accounted for 23% to 40% of the national total export volume. According to the same year's statistics, Hankou ranked third among the five major commercial ports in terms of total domestic and foreign trade.

Wuhan is also a city with an early foundation of light and heavy industry, and it has ample conditions for development. Before the War of Resistance Against Japan, Wuhan had a total of 516 factories and more than 43,000 workers. Among them, there were 150 mechanical industry units, 6 yarn mill units with more than 270,000 spindles, 17 flour mill units, and 10 power plant units. In addition, there were steel plants, ordnance factories, cement plants, and tobacco companies. The raw materials used by these factories were mostly obtained from the vicinity of Wuhan. Therefore, thanks to the abundance of resources, Wuhan's industry simultaneously developed towards both light and heavy industries.

However, since the War of Resistance Against Japan, Wuhan's industry and commerce have undergone significant changes. The reason is that in the early stage of the War of Resistance Against Japan, 223 factories were relocated inland from Wuhan, accounting for half of the 452 factories relocated inland at that time. Among them, the largest in scale was the textile industry, and the largest in number was the machinery industry. These relocated and un-relocated factories suffered serious losses. During the occupation period, the Japanese invaders frantically plundered materials in Wuhan, which aggravated the blow to Wuhan's industry! Until after Japan's surrender, Chiang Kai-shek's bandits were greedy and insatiable, carrying out endless searches and exploitations for the anti-people civil war, which gave Wuhan's industry a heavy blow! This caused Wuhan's industry and commerce to plummet, decline and fall, far from what it used to be!

Even so, Wuhan is still one of the important industrial and commercial cities in the country. According to a survey by the puppet regime in 1947, there were more than 26,000 large and small businesses in Wuhan, 459 factories, and more than 21,000 workers. Its main industries include:

　　Food Industry 82
　　Textile Industry 39
　　Chemical Industry 33
　　Metal Industry 21
　　Electrical Equipment 14
　　Transportation Equipment 22
　　Mechanical Industry 190

The existing equipment of these industries has the following monthly production capacity:

　　Flour 353,673 bags (processing)
　　White Rice 24,255 shi (1 shi = approx. 100 liters) (processing)
　　Cotton Yarn 5,716 pieces
　　Cotton Cloth 14,462 bolts
　　Cloth 1,672 bolts
　　Cigarettes 7,600 boxes
　　Matches 300 boxes
　　Soap 75,476 boxes
　　Glass 480 tons
　　Power Machines 17 units
　　Food Processing Machines 1,062 units
　　Other Operating Machines 366 units
　　Metal Products 37 tons
　　Light Bulbs 40,000
　　Dry Batteries 20,383 dozen

The monthly raw material requirements of these industries, mainly:

　　Grain and Brown Rice 41,926 city dan
　　Wheat 241,629 city dan
　　Cotton 23,955 city dan
　　Tobacco 8,482 city dan
　　Iron 1,552 tons

(Note: The above industries do not include military industry and coal, iron, steel, electricity, cement, etc. near Wuhan.)

From this, it can be seen that Wuhan, which is now liberated and belongs to the people, still possesses a valuable legacy. Based on this legacy, our generation will surely build it more prosperous and beautiful than ever before!

### 武汉经济状况介绍

　　武汉经济状况介绍
    廖季立
    武汉地处我国本部的中心，顺汉水北上可至陕西、甘肃；顺长江西上经沙市、宜昌可通四川；顺长江东下经江西、安徽、江苏而至上海；顺湘江、沅江可通湖南、贵州。武汉又扼全国铁路的中心，沿平汉路北上经河南、河北、平津可直达东北；沿粤汉路南下可通广东、香港。自古称为“九省通衢”。由于它所处地位的优异，武汉特别是汉口，遂成为国内五大商埠之一。在抗战前，依一九三六年统计，汉口对内贸易占五大商埠（上海、天津、广州、青岛、汉口）的第二位，每年集中汉口的棉花达二百万担，占全国棉产第一位的湖北上市棉花的百分之七十五；每年集中的小麦占鄂豫湘三省全部出售量的百分之五十二。对外贸易虽不如上海、天津、广州与青岛，但以茶叶讲，汉口为三大茶市之一；以桐油讲，经过汉口出口的占全国总出口的百分之二十三至四十。依同年统计，对内对外贸易总额，汉口占五大商埠的第三位。
    武汉同时又是早有基础的一个轻重工业的城市，它并具备了充分发展的条件。抗战前，武汉共有工厂五百一十六家，工人四万三千余人。其中有机械工业一百五十个单位，纱厂六个单位，有纱锭二十七万余枚，麦粉厂十七个单位，电厂十个单位，此外有钢铁厂、兵工厂、水泥厂及烟草公司等。这些工厂所用原料大部取给于武汉附近，因此借资源的充裕，又使武汉工业同时向轻工业与重工业同时发展。
    但是，抗日战争以后到现在，武汉工商业已发生显著的变化。其原因是：抗战初期武汉内迁工厂达二百二十三个单位，占当时全国内迁工厂四百五十二个单位的一半，其中规模最大的为纺织业，厂数最多的为机器业。这些内迁以及未迁的工厂均有严重损失。而在沦陷期间，因日寇在武汉疯狂抢运物资，又加重了对武汉工业的打击！迄至日本投降后，蒋匪又贪婪无厌，进行无止境的搜刮、压榨，以作反人民的内战，又给武汉工业以沉重摧残！这样遂使武汉工商业一落千丈，凋敝零落，远非昔日可比了！
    虽然如此，武汉现在还不失为全国工商业重要城市之一。据一九四七年伪方调查，武汉大小商业二万六千余家，工厂四百五十九家，工人二万一千余人，其主要工业计有：
    食品业　八二家
    纺织业　三九家
    化学工业　三三家
    五金工业　二一家
    电工器材　一四家
    交通用具　二二家
    机械工业　一九○家
    这些工业的现有设备其每月生产力计：
    面粉　三五三，六七三袋（加工）
    白米　二四，二五五石（加工）
    棉纱　五，七一六件
    棉布　一四，四六二匹
    布匹　一，六七二匹
    卷烟　七，六○○箱
    火柴　三○○箱
    肥皂　七五，四七六箱
    玻璃　四八○吨
    动力机　十七部
    食品加工机　一，○六二部
    其他作业机　三六六部
    金属用品　三七吨
    灯泡　四○，○○○只
    干电池　二○，三八三打
    这些工业每月所需原料，以主要的计：
    谷及糙米四一，九二六市担
    小麦二四一，六二九市担
    棉花　二三，九五五市担
    烟草　八，四八二市担
    铁　一，五五二吨
    （注：上述工业均未包括军事工业及武汉附近之煤、铁、钢、电力、水泥等。）
    由此可见，现在解放了的为人民所有的武汉，仍然拥有宝贵的遗产的。在这个遗产的基础上，在我们这一代一定会把它建设得比任何时期更繁荣，更美丽！
