    North China Regional Cooperative Cadre Symposium
    How to Run Supply and Marketing Cooperatives?
    Supporting Producers Leads to Development; Pursuing Dividends Leads to Failure
    Conduct business based on the actual production and living needs of the local masses.
    Help producers investigate supply and marketing conditions in various places.
    The cooperative should become an economic organization of the masses, not a relief agency.
    [Report from this newspaper] The North China General Supply and Marketing Cooperative invited cooperative cadres from areas including Central Hebei, Hebei-Shandong-Henan, and Eastern Hebei, who were in Beijing to visit the industrial exhibition, to a symposium on the 13th of this month to discuss the situation of pilot supply and marketing cooperatives in various places and exchange experiences. Since April, various regions have begun pilot supply and marketing cooperatives in rural areas with a focus on key areas, in accordance with the new cooperative principles (draft) stipulated by the North China People's Government. Everyone believes that initial achievements and experiences have been gained in the past month. The Central Hebei District has established 38 key community and town cooperatives in 30 counties, developing 2,731 members. The Hebei-Shandong-Henan District has established one key cooperative in each of the eight counties, developing 4,800 members. In the Eastern Hebei District, due to the poor foundation of the old cooperatives, this time, in addition to conducting key pilot projects in Lin'nancang, where mat weaving is developed, the district is focusing its main efforts on piloting employee cooperatives in Tangshan.

    During the symposium, everyone believed that the more successful cooperatives were those where the cadres piloting the projects had a clearer understanding of the principles of serving members and production, and who began by conducting in-depth investigations and research. They based their business operations on the local economic characteristics and the actual needs of the masses in production and life, and they absorbed members and gained the support of the masses. For example, Comrade Cao Guocai, head of the Business Section of the Central Hebei District General Supply and Marketing Cooperative, discussed the district's key pilot project in Anxin County. He learned that most of the local people made a living by weaving mats. Currently, due to poor sales channels for their products, the masses were experiencing difficulties in both production and life. The cooperative cadres immediately promoted the establishment of a supply and marketing cooperative focused on the mat industry, calling on the masses to invest in shares with mats (one mat per share). The cooperative purchased mats from its members for sale, purchased daily necessities and production raw materials, and supplied them to members at low prices. The district also used the same method to organize a supply and marketing cooperative focused on the textile industry in Ding County, where the domestic cloth industry is highly developed, ordering ten counts of coarse yarn from the Da Xing Yarn Factory in Shijiazhuang to supplement the shortage of domestic yarn. They also transported domestic cloth to Tianjin and exchanged it for grain transported from the Northeast Cooperative into the customs area (because the area lacked grain). After transporting it back to the local area, the cost was still 20% to 30% lower than the market price. Therefore, the supply and marketing cooperative guaranteed low-price supplies for its members. Conducting business in this way and developing members, the cooperative became closely linked to the economic lives of the masses. The masses placed great hope in this type of supply and marketing cooperative, which does not distribute dividends but can provide support and reliance in production and life, and actively invested in shares and promoted it widely. The pilot supply and marketing cooperative in Anxin County had more than 320 shareholders within ten days. The cadres within the cooperative, fearing that too many members would lead to a backlog of mats that they would be unable to sell, and unable to manage the business at that time, even stopped accepting new members for a time (this was of course inappropriate, and the strength of the members should be further mobilized for collective transportation and sales). In order to develop business, the Central Hebei District General Supply and Marketing Cooperative conducted extensive investigations into the production and sales of various goods. They learned that domestic cloth from more than ten counties, including Gaoyang and Xinle, had a certain market in the Northeast and Suiyuan-Mongolia areas. They also learned that Xiong County and Anxin and other ten counties in the district produced large quantities of hide saltpeter, with each laborer able to produce an average of about 100 jin of saltpeter per day. However, due to the lack of sales channels for a long time, production stagnated. According to investigations, however, several chemical factories in Tianjin had stopped producing certain items due to the lack of saltpeter raw materials. The Anxin County Supply and Marketing Cooperative has now begun to sell saltpeter and exchange it for daily necessities. If regular supply and sales can be established in the future, the production of chemicals and the lives of saltpeter miners can be guaranteed.

    Currently, the leadership of the district's General Supply and Marketing Cooperative has begun to consider how to further integrate with the production and life of farmers in various aspects. This is also something that all regions should pay attention to and focus on studying. For example, what kind of goods do farmers need to exchange for after harvesting wheat? How to carry out supply and marketing operations focused on cotton planting in areas with a lot of cotton planting, and how to plan the establishment of cotton ginning tools and solve the difficulties of cotton farmers in terms of grain, animal feed, and fuel? At the same time, use existing experience to further organize and expand members, strengthen the foundation, and rely on the strength of the members. Establish close ties with trading companies and state-owned stores to allow the supply and marketing cooperative to achieve new development.

    On the other hand, many facts in the symposium showed that in some regions, the supply and marketing cooperatives were unable to carry out supply and marketing operations based on the needs of the masses. When organizing the cooperatives, the publicity to the masses focused too much on how they could buy cheap and sell dear after joining the cooperative and receive preferential treatment. The masses joined the cooperatives only for these immediate benefits. For example, in the supply and marketing cooperative piloted in Puyang County, Hebei-Shandong-Henan District, the goods were sometimes sold at one-third lower than the market price. Seeing this difference, the masses competed to buy shares and used aliases and substituted names, falsely reporting double shares in order to buy more cheap goods. In this way, the masses regarded the supply and marketing cooperative as a government-run relief agency, not their own economic organization, because these cooperatives were very poor at organizing the masses to meet their needs through developing supply and marketing operations. Some supply and marketing cooperatives were divorced from the needs of their members, engaging in commerce and pursuing profits. Some were afraid of losing money in business and found it difficult to "maintain capital with physical goods," so they kept the goods in storage without moving them. The Gaoling County Supply and Marketing Cooperative in the Hebei-Shandong-Henan District distributed the members' share capital and original funds to the members in equal shares of ten jin of grain per person. This was dispersing the funds of the supply and marketing cooperative and not actively developing supply and marketing operations, making it difficult to meet the production and living needs of the members, let alone opening up sales channels for agricultural and handicraft products.

    Finally, Liang Yao, Deputy Director of the North China General Supply and Marketing Cooperative, pointed out in his speech that the above good and bad experiences are worth accepting in various places, and he provided personal opinions on the future work of various districts, and explained some specific issues raised by various places.

    华北各地合作干部座谈
    怎样办供销合作社？
    扶持生产者获发展追求红利者必失败
    根据当地群众生产与生活的实际需要开展业务。 
    帮助生产者调查各地供销状况。
    要使合作社成为群众的经济组织，不要成为救济机关
    【本报讯】华北供销合作总社于本月十三日召请冀中、冀鲁豫、冀东等地来平参观工业展览会的合作社干部座谈各地试办供销合作社的情况，交流经验。各地区于四月份开始依照华北人民政府所规定的新的合作方针（草案），有重点地在农村试办供销合作社，大家认为月余以来已获得初步成绩与经验。冀中区已在三十个县共建立了三十八个集镇重点社，发展社员二千七百三十一名；冀鲁豫区在八个县内每县建立了一个重点社，已发展社员四千八百名；冀东区因旧有合作社基础较差，此次除在席业发达的林南仓进行重点试办外，该区以主要力量试办唐山的职工合作社。
    座谈中，大家认为建社中较有成绩的，都是由于试办的干部对为社员、为生产服务的方针比较明确，开始先作深入的调查研究，根据当地经济特点及群众在生产与生活上的实际需要而开展业务，吸收社员，得到群众的拥护。如冀中区供销合作总社业务科长曹国才同志谈该区在安新县进行重点试办时，了解到当地群众大部靠织席为生，现因产品销路不畅，群众生产和生活均感困难，合作社干部即宣传群众成立以席业为主的供销合作社，号召群众以席子入股（一片席作一股），合作社并收购社员席子，向外推销，购回生活必需品与生产原料，低价供给社员。该区并以同样办法，在土布业甚为发展的定县组织以纺织业为主的供销社，向石家庄大兴纱厂订购十枝粗纱，供给社员群众，以补土纱之不足；并将土布运至天津，与东北合作社运进关内的粮食进行交换（因该地缺粮），运回本地后，成本仍较市价可低百分之二十到三十，因之供销社保证了对社员的低价供给。如此进行业务，发展社员，与群众的经济生活发生密切联系，群众对这种不分红、而在生产和生活上能得到支持和依靠的供销社寄予很大热望，积极入股并广为宣传。安新县试办的供销社十天内有三百二十余人入股。社内干部因怕社员多了积存席子无力推销，一时掌握不了业务，中间甚至曾停止吸收社员（这当然是不适当的，应该进一步发动社员群众的力量进行，集体运销）。冀中区供销总社为开展业务，曾多方调查各种物品的产销情况，了解到该区高阳、新乐等十余县的土布在东北与绥蒙一带有其一定市场；又该区雄县、安新等十县盛产皮硝，每个劳动力平均每天可熬硝百斤左右，因久无销路，生产停滞，但据调查天津却有数家化学厂因无皮硝原料而停止了某些物品的生产。安新县供销社现已开始推销皮硝，换回生活用品。以后如能建立经常的供销，则化工生产与硝民生活均可得到保障。
    现该区供销总社领导上开始考虑如何进一步多方面与农民的生产、生活相结合，这也是各地应该重视和着重研究的。如农民在收了麦子后需交换何种物品，对植棉较多的地区如何开展以植棉为重心的供销业务，有计划的设置轧花工具与解决棉农粮食、畜草、燃料的困难。同时并运用已有经验，进一步组织与扩大社员，充实基础，依靠社员群众的力量。密切与贸易公司、国营商店的联系，使供销社得到新的发展。
    另一方面，在座谈中不少事实说明，在试办中，有些地区的供销社尚不能根据群众需要开展供销业务；在组社时对群众宣传多偏重于入社后可以如何贱买贵卖，受到优待、群众亦只是为此眼前利益而入社。如冀鲁豫区在濮阳县试办的供销社，售货有时较市价低三分之一，群众见有此悬殊，争相入股，并化名顶替，虚报双股，以便买到更多的便宜货。这样，群众只是把供销当成官办的救济机关，而不是自己的经济组织，因为这些社对于如何组织群众从开展供销业务中满足群众要求进行得很差。有的供销社则脱离社员需要，经营商业，追求利润；有的则害怕经营赔钱，难以“实物保本”，则保存物品不动；冀鲁豫区高陵县的供销社则将社员股金和原有资金以每人十斤粮食平均分贷给社员。这样是分散供销社的资金，并不是积极开展供销业务，很难满足社员群众生产和生活上的需要，更不能为农产品和手工业品打开销路。
    最后，华北供销合作总社副主任梁耀同志在发言中指出：以上好坏经验值得各地接受，并对各区今后工作的进行提供了个人意见，对各地所提出的某些具体问题进行了说明。
