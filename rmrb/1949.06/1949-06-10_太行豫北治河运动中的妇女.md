In the Taihang Fourth Special District (Northern Henan), the river management movement last winter and this spring involved massive projects. Due to a severe labor shortage, completing the tasks would have been impossible without mobilizing women to participate. Under the leadership of the Party and the government, the entire district mobilized 86,270 men and women (full and part-time laborers) in a short period to manage the rivers. Among them, 24,987 women (full and part-time laborers) participated from six counties: Xiuwu, Wenxian, Qinyang, Bo'ai, Wuzhi, and Huojia. This produced many model river management women and activists, who played a huge role in river management. Despite severe spring famine and the urgent need to support the land reform front lines, these women overcame various difficulties and completed the river management projects ahead of schedule. Xiuwu County mobilized 13,400 male laborers and 9,408 female laborers. Of the 790 models in the county, 356 were women. Thanks to the active and exemplary role of women, Xiuwu River Works completed river management projects in less than four days that had not been undertaken in over 200 years, freeing up 133,760 mu of submerged land. At a yield of five dou per mu, this could increase grain production by 66,800 shi.

The reasons for mobilizing a large number of women to participate in river management and achieving great success are, first and foremost, the implementation of the Chinese Communist Party Central Committee's women's movement policy from top to bottom. After the women's movement policy was communicated, leaders and cadres at all levels initially examined their thinking, criticized past views of underestimating and exploiting women, and summarized the achievements of women's participation in production. From the perspective of leadership ideology, they clarified that mobilizing women was a strength, not a burden. Therefore, in the river management movement (especially in Xiuwu), the leadership had planned, organized, and unified arrangements from the beginning, mobilizing both men and women simultaneously. Xiuwu and Bo'ai counties conducted mobilization among district and village cadres and party branches, explaining that the spring river management work was the primary task in agricultural production in the flood-stricken areas. Mobilizing women to participate could, on the one hand, ensure the completion of river management tasks, and on the other hand, implement the women's movement policy, thereby raising the status of women through mobilizing them for labor. Xiuwu also proposed to pay special attention to the specific difficulties of women when mobilizing them, such as not allowing pregnant women, breastfeeding mothers, or women with menstruation to participate. Generally, women were only allowed to do light work and were not required to do the same work as men, preventing some cadres from simply exploiting women. Secondly, during the river management process, education on the glory and benefit of labor was carried out to enlighten women's production consciousness. The positive actions of women in river management broke the male view of underestimating women, thereby also increasing women's confidence. For example, when Bo'ai started mobilizing women, some people said: "It's ridiculous to ask women to manage the river." Some said: "If you ask women to carry river soil, they will fall into the river and not be worth the cost." Even the women themselves lacked confidence. After summarizing past achievements in participating in production and the education of seeking liberation through participating in production, many women proposed: "Not working and cherishing strength is self-suffering, not afraid of hardship can produce and eat for oneself," determined to strive for model status in river management. Therefore, young and strong women in counties such as Bo'ai and Xiuwu participated in digging rivers and carrying soil, and most even went into the water to work, challenging and competing with men.

Due to their active labor in carrying river soil, women's political and social status has been greatly improved. The participation of more than 20,000 women in river management throughout the district, making it possible to complete huge projects ahead of schedule, is an unprecedented feat. It has made people who generally underestimated women truly realize that mobilizing women is a great force, which plays a huge role in increasing social and family wealth. Many people reflected: "Women are really useful, carrying burdens in the water like men. We can't underestimate them in the future!"

However, in individual places, there were still cases where the specific difficulties of women were not adequately taken care of. In order to complete the task ahead of schedule, a certain village allowed a woman who was about to give birth to participate, and those who were breastfeeding and sick were also allowed to participate. The impact was very bad. The leadership immediately corrected it after discovering it. In addition, during the river management movement, the Women's Committee did not personally participate due to other work, so ideological education was not done enough. The models and activists that were discovered were not educated and improved to serve as backbones in future large-scale production. This is a major shortcoming.

　　太行豫北治河运动中的妇女
    太行四地委妇委会
    太行四专区（豫北）去冬今春的修河运动工程浩大，而劳力又十分缺乏，因之非发动妇女参加就难以完成任务。在党和政府的领导下，短时期内全分区发动了八万六千二百七十个男女全半劳力参加治河，其中修武、温县、沁阳、博爱、武陟、获嘉六个县就参加了二万四千九百八十七个妇女全半劳力，产生了很多修河妇女模范和积极分子，在修河中起了巨大作用，在春荒严重及土地改革支援前线的紧迫情况下，克服了种种困难，提早完成治河工程。修武县参加了男劳力一万三千四百个，女劳力九千四百零八个，全县模范七百九十人，女模范就有三百五十六人。由于妇女的积极模范作用，修武河工以不足四天的时间，完成了二百多年来未曾做过的修河工程，空出水淹地十三万三千七百六十多亩，每亩以五斗产量计算，可增产粮食六万六千八百石。
    这次发动广大妇女参加治河并获得巨大成绩的原因，首先是自上而下的贯彻了中共中央的妇运方针。自传达了妇运方针后，各级领导和干部都初步检查了思想，批判了过去对妇女的轻视和利用观点，总结了妇女参加生产的成绩，从领导思想上明确了把妇女发动起来是力量而不是负担。因此在治河运动中（特别是修武）领导上一开始就有计划有组织地统一布置，同时发动男人妇女。修武博爱两县，在区村干部及支部中进行动员，说明这次春季治河工作是水灾区农业生产中的首要工作，发动妇女参加，一方面可保证治河任务的完成，一方面可贯彻妇运方针，从发动妇女劳动中提高妇女地位。修武在发动妇女时并提出要特别照顾妇女的特殊困难，如怀孕的和有小孩吃奶的有月经的妇女不让参加，一般妇女也只让做轻活，不要求和男人一样。防止某些干部对妇女的单纯利用观点。其次，在治河过程中，贯彻劳动光荣和劳动有利的教育，启发妇女的生产自觉。并以妇女在治河中的积极行动，打破男人轻视妇女的观点，从而也提高了妇女的信心。如博爱开始发动妇女时，有人说：叫女人家去修河才是胡闹。有的说：叫女人家去挑河，掉在河里还不够本哩。连妇女本身也没信心。经过总结过去参加生产的成绩，和参加生产求解放的教育，不少妇女提出：“不劳动惜力气自受自忍，不怕苦能生产自作自吃”，下决心要在修河中争模范，因此博爱修武等县青壮妇女都参加了挖河担土，大部还都下水做工，和男人们挑战竞赛。
    由于在挑河中的积极劳动，大大提高了妇女的政治社会地位。全分区两万多妇女参加治河，使巨大工程提早完成，这是空前的创举，使一般轻视妇女的人真正认识了妇女发动起来是一支很大的力量，对社会和家庭财富的增加起着绝大作用。不少人反映说：“妇女真顶事，和男人一样下水挑担，以后可不能小看她们了”！
    但个别地方还有对妇女的具体困难照顾不够的情形，为了提早完成任务，某村让一个快生孩子的妇女参加，喂奶的有病的也都让参加。影响很不好，领导上发现后已立即纠正。另外在治河运动中，妇委因有其他工作未亲自参加，因此思想教育做的不够，发现的模范和积极分子，也未加以教育提高以作为以后大生产中的骨干，这是一个大缺点。
