　　Pay Attention to Road Maintenance Work!
  　The Railways in Areas Like Beiping East Station Have Been Neglected for a Long Time
    Vice Minister Lü Personally Inspects and Gives Instructions
    [Our Dispatch] Lü Zhengcao, Vice Minister of Railways, along with Yuan Zhongfan, Deputy Director of the Engineering Bureau; Zhou Xiaping, Deputy Director of the Locomotive Bureau; Zhen Tao, Deputy Director of the Transportation Bureau, and over ten others, personally inspected the lines at Beiping East Station and the Fengtai section on June 2nd. They discovered that 80% of the spikes on the tracks within Beiping East Station were loose, and many of the sleepers lacked the ability to hold the spikes firmly; even the spikes on the newly replaced sleepers were also loose. Over 70% of the screws were loose, either completely detached, or the threads were rusted and the washers had fallen off, rendering them ineffective; some places even lacked spikes altogether, and the newly replaced sleepers had not been tamped properly. The track gauge exceeded the standard (the standard gauge is 1.435 meters) by 33 millimeters, the rail joint gaps were as wide as 40 millimeters, and the difference in height between the joints of two different types of steel rails was as much as 3 millimeters. Other issues included the wheel flange passageway of the guard rail being too narrow (only 40 millimeters wide), missing screws, and broken fishplates not being replaced. This causes severe wear and tear on the locomotive driving wheels and provides no guarantee for safe operation.
  　Before Liberation, They Only Cared About Avoiding Accidents
    According to Chen Daxing, a veteran foreman who has worked in track maintenance for over 30 years, the Beiping East Station track maintenance team has a total of 46 people, but only about 20 are actually working on-site; the rest are mostly staying at the station doing administrative work. Vice Minister Lü asked him that since the 9.5 kilometers of track at East Station only requires 20 people according to the staffing level, why is the road maintenance work at East Station still so poor, with so many people and so much experience? He said, "Alas, this is all the scourge left over from the Kuomintang era. Our track maintenance workers were never treated as people in the past. They only cared about avoiding accidents, and they didn't care about road maintenance at all."
    After arriving at Fengtai, in addition to inspecting the locomotive depot, the condition of the Pinghan main line was better, but 40% to 50% of the screws were still loose, and 80% of the spikes were loose. When Vice Minister Lü and others went to the depot, they happened to meet track maintenance worker Zhao He, who was also inspecting the road. He said, "These Kuomintang screws are a waste of effort to fix. They can't be tightened and they can't be loosened. They must be completely replaced."
  　Establish a Collective Responsibility System to Eliminate the Phenomenon of No One Taking Responsibility
    Due to the late hour, the lines within Fengtai Station were not inspected. At the South marshalling yard, it was observed that many sleepers were rotten, the lines had been neglected for a long time, the rail surface was uneven, the track gauge was irregular, and the situation of vertical and horizontal bending was even more serious.
    Finally, Vice Minister Lü instructed that in the future, the station, engineering section, inspection section, and locomotive section should establish a collective responsibility system, joint labor, and division of responsibilities. The engineering section should patrol the roads day and night in sections to become familiar with the situation, inspect and repair them at any time, and completely eliminate all work negligence and the phenomenon of no one taking responsibility caused by non-material reasons.

### 注意养路工作！　北平东站等地铁路久失修整  吕副部长亲往查看指示

　　注意养路工作！
  　北平东站等地铁路久失修整
    吕副部长亲往查看指示
    【本报讯】铁道部吕正操副部长及工务局副局长袁仲凡、机务局副局长周侠平、运输局副局长甄陶等十余人，于六月二日亲往北平东站、丰台段查看线路；发现北平东站站内线路上的道钉有百分之八十浮起，枕木缺乏持钉力的固多，但新换枕木上之道钉也同样浮起。螺丝松动的有百分之七十以上，或螺丝完全松脱，或丝扣锈住而垫圈脱落，松动不起作用，甚至有些地方根本没有道钉，新换枕木也未经捣固。轨距有超出标准（按标准轨距为一·四三五公尺）三十三公厘的，轨头接缝有宽至四十公厘的，两根异型钢轨之接头则有上下相差三公厘之多，其他如护轮轨与正轨轮缘通路太窄（仅四十公厘宽）螺丝缺少，鱼尾钣破裂不换等都很多，对于机车动轮日常磨耗非常严重，并对行车之安全，毫无保证。
  　解放前只知对付不出事故就算了
    又据在道班做了三十多年的老工长陈大兴说：北平东站道班共有四十六人，现在只有二十余人在现场做活，其余多半留在车站做事务工作。吕副部长问他，既然东站九公里半的线路，按编制只需二十人足够，现在有了这许多人，又有经验，为什么东站的养路工作还如此之糟呢？他说：“唉，这都是国民党时代留下的祸害，我们道班工人过去从来也没有被当作过人，只知道对付着不出事故就算了，那里还管得养路。”
    到丰台后，查看机务段外，平汉正线情形较好，但也有百分之四十至五十的螺丝松动，百分之八十的道钉浮起。吕副部长等往段上时，正碰到道班工友赵合也在查路，他说：“这些国民党螺丝钉，修它也白费劲，既上不去，又下不来，必须彻底换除才好。”
  　建立集体负责制消灭无人负责现象
    丰台站内线路因天晚，没有查看，向南操车场看到枕木多腐朽，线路长期无人负责看护，轨面不平，轨距不整，上下左右弯曲的情形更加严重。
    最后吕副部长指示：以后车站与工务段、检车段、机务段应建立集体负责制、联合劳动、分工负责。工务段要分段日夜巡道才能熟悉情况，随时查看修整，澈底消灭所有非材料原因的工作疏忽与无人负责的现象。
