Xinhua News Agency, Qiongya, 9th. The Qiongya People's Liberation Army's strict discipline and simple living habits, with no violations of the people, during this spring offensive, have earned universal praise from the people of the cities of Danxian, Changjiang, and Ganen counties. The people in the newly liberated areas all praise them as the "political army" and the "benevolent and righteous troops." Before the start of the spring offensive, all units conducted education on urban policies and discipline, and every commander and fighter included "obeying discipline and loving the people" and "not taking a single needle or thread from the people" in their merit-making plans. When the People's Liberation Army entered Danxian county seat to search for remnants of the enemy, they entered every civilian house empty-handed and left empty-handed. The landlady of one store was initially unfamiliar with our army and very afraid. She said to the searching troops: "Take whatever you want!" The PLA soldiers comforted her, explained our army's policies, apologized after the search was completed, and then withdrew. Afterwards, this landlady told everyone she met: "I have never heard of such a good army in the whole world." When the PLA was stationed in Baimajing, the streets were full of various food stalls, but no one went to buy or use them. Merchants praised: "If it were those 'four-legs' (referring to the Kuomintang reactionary army), they would have looted everything long ago. You are truly our people!" Wang Yahan, a soldier from the Fourth Company of a certain unit, slept on the side of the street. When the people saw him, they asked him to sleep indoors, and when they saw that his clothes were ragged, they sent him a new set of clothes and two silver coins, but he politely declined them all. When the PLA was stationed in Changpo City, they did not live in civilian houses at all. It was raining heavily at night, and everyone still slept under the eaves of the houses on the street, without a single person entering civilian houses privately. The residents were very moved. When the PLA captured Ganen county seat and Changjiang, Changwen Port, and other places, the residents saw that the PLA lacked food and clothing, and they offered food, clothing, and silver, but were all refused. The people questioned: "You are doing things for the people, why don't you accept the people's gifts?" The PLA commanders and fighters said: "It is right to do things for the people. We are the people's army, and we cannot take a single needle or thread from the people casually." The people were all moved when they heard this. The residents paid special attention to our army's life, and they watched whenever our army ate. They saw that the People's Army only ate some coarse grain rice and a small piece of salted fish for each meal, and the commanders were no exception. They sadly asked: "The Kuomintang army is so bad, yet they enjoy such luxury. Why do you, such a good army, suffer so much?" The PLA commanders explained: "We are the people's army, and what we eat and wear belongs to the common people. The common people are suffering so much now, what does it matter if we suffer a little?" The residents nodded in praise. When the commanders and fighters helped residents carry water, sweep the floor, and work, the residents said: "We have only ever seen armies that rob the people, and never seen armies that work for the people." When the PLA left due to combat operations, the townspeople pleaded with them to stay. Some people even said to the PLA with tears in their eyes: "Don't leave, if you leave, those 'four-legs' will come again to ask for money and soldiers, and rob us."

　　琼崖我军爱民
  　新区群众称誉为“政治大军”
    【新华社琼崖九日电】琼崖人民解放军在这次春季攻势中秋毫无犯的严明纪律和艰苦朴素的生活作风，获得儋县、昌江、感恩三县城市人民的普遍赞扬。新解放区的人民都称誉他们为“政治大军”、“仁义部队”。春季攻势开始之前，各部队都进行了城市政策纪律教育，每个指战员都把“遵纪爱民”和“不取民间一针一线”列入立功计划中。当解放军攻入儋县县城进行搜索残敌时，进入每间民房都是空手入空手出，有一家商店的老板娘开始对我军不了解，非常害怕，她对搜索部队说：“你们要什么东西就拿去吧！”解放军战士便一面安慰她，一面解释我军政策，搜索任务完毕后，又向她道歉，然后才退出来。事后这个老板娘逢人便说：“普天下我没听过这样好的军队。”解放军进驻白马井时，街上摆满各种食物摊，但是没有一个人前去购买或动用。商民赞叹说：“要是那些四脚（指国民党反动派军队），早已劫掠光了。你们真是我们的人啊！”某部四连战士王亚汉睡在街边。民众见了纷纷要求他进屋里睡，见他衣服破烂，又送来一套新衣和二枚白银，但都被他婉言谢绝了。解放军进驻长坡市时，完全不住民房，夜间下着大雨，大家仍在街旁屋檐下露宿，没有一个私入民房。居民非常感动。解放军攻占感恩县城及昌江、昌文港等地时，居民见解放军缺吃少穿，纷纷赠送食物、衣服、白银，但都被谢绝了，民众质问道：“你们替人民做事，为什么不接受人民的礼物？”解放军指战员说：“替人民做事是应该的。我们是人民的军队，不能随便要人民一针一线。”民众听了都很感动。居民们对我军的生活特别注意，每当我军吃饭时都围着看。他们看见人民军队每餐只吃些杂粮饭和一小块咸鱼，指挥员也不例外，都很难过地问道：“国民党军队那样坏还那样享福，你们这样好的军队为什么反而这样吃得这样苦呢？”解放军指挥员解释道：“我们是人民的军队，吃的穿的都是老百姓的，老百姓现在这样苦，我们吃一点苦算得什么。”居民听了点头赞叹不已。当指战员替居民挑水扫地和劳作时，居民又纷纷说道：“从来只见过打劫老百姓的军队，没见过替老百姓做工的军队。”当解放军因战斗行动离开时，城镇民众苦苦挽留，有些人甚至流着泪对解放军说：“你们不要离开吧，你们去了，那些四脚又要来要钱要兵，打劫我们了。”
