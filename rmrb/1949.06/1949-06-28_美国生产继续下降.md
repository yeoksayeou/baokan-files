　　Xinhua News Agency, Peiping, 27th. A United Press report on the stock market for the week ending the 25th states: "New York stocks, after six weeks of continuous decline, have reached their lowest point since 1945. Although there was an upturn last week, the rebound in stocks was due to technical factors." The weekly report also pointed out: The industrial production index in Barron's Weekly (a Wall Street magazine) has reached its lowest point since December 7, 1946. The Department of Commerce reported that production continued to decline from mid-April to mid-May. Steel, oil production, and the automobile and loading industries have also declined.

    【新华社北平二十七日电】合众社发表二十五日为止的股票市场一周述评称：“纽约股票经过六星期的连续下降，已到达自一九四五年以来的最低点。上星期虽有了起色，但股票回涨是由于技术上的因素。”一周述评并指出：拜隆周刊（华尔街的杂志）上的工业生产指数，已达到一九四六年十二月七日以来的最低点。商务部报告四月中旬至五月中旬生产继续下降。钢铁、石油生产及汽车及装载业也均告下降。
