Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 11th: According to TASS from Paris: On June 9th, the foreign ministers of the four countries held their fourth meeting of the third week. US Secretary of State Acheson chaired the meeting, which lasted five hours. British Foreign Secretary Bevin returned from Britain to attend near the meeting's end.

　　At the beginning of the foreign ministers' meeting, Acheson proposed that the four foreign ministers issue instructions to their respective occupying authorities in Germany to complete the ongoing negotiations in Berlin on abolishing traffic, transportation, and trade restrictions between Berlin and the Western occupation zones of Germany, and between the Eastern and Western occupation zones of Germany, by June 13th. The French and British representatives supported this proposal. Soviet Foreign Minister Vyshinsky said: The Soviet side has not delayed consideration of the issue of abolishing the aforementioned restrictions. In fact, Order No. 56, issued by the Soviet administration on May 9, 1949, had already announced the abolition of all restrictions imposed by the Soviet occupation authorities since March 1, 1948. Unfortunately, such orders have not been issued in other occupation zones. The Soviet occupation authorities completely abolished the restrictions they had imposed since March 1, 1948. Subsequent negotiations relate to certain issues related to the abolition of the above-mentioned restrictions and the following fact: our representatives believe that other occupation zones have not completely lifted the restrictions. Vyshinsky said: He has inquired with the Soviet occupation authorities about the progress of the negotiations and will respond to Acheson's proposal when he receives the necessary information. During the meeting, Vyshinsky declared that he had received the information he requested and said that he had no objection to Acheson's proposal.

　　At this meeting, the four foreign ministers were scheduled to continue reviewing the second item on the agenda: "Berlin and the Currency Issue." However, Chairman Acheson attempted to shorten the discussion on this issue, suggesting to "move on" and reserve the right to return to the second agenda item later. Vyshinsky opposed the attempt to circumvent discussion of the most important issue on the foreign ministers' meeting agenda. He reminded the meeting that the communiqué issued by the four governments in New York had determined that the Berlin issue also included the currency issue. At the beginning of this foreign ministers' meeting, it was also decided to discuss the currency issue. Therefore, I am not only concerned about my own rights, but I am also concerned about the obligations of my colleagues in the foreign ministers' meeting.

　　Specific Content of the Former Four-Power Agreement:
	Soviet Zone German Mark Should Be the Single Currency of Berlin

　　Afterwards, Vyshinsky elaborated on the Soviet delegation's opinion on the issue of a single currency for all of Berlin. Vyshinsky said: The Soviet Union suggests that the review of the Berlin currency issue should be based on the decisions already agreed upon by the four countries. He pointed out that on August 30, 1948, the Soviet Union, the United States, Britain, and France had reached an agreement on promoting the German Mark of the Soviet occupation zone in Berlin as the single currency and prohibiting the circulation of Western Marks in Berlin. Vyshinsky recalled the content of this agreement, stating: The first item of this agreement stipulates the abolition of restrictions on traffic, transportation, and trade between Berlin and the Western occupation zones, as well as restrictions on freight entering and leaving the Soviet occupation zone. On this basis, an agreement was subsequently reached on May 4, 1949, and implemented on May 12. The Soviet occupation zone has abolished the aforementioned restrictions. Therefore, the first item of the August 30, 1948 agreement has been fulfilled. The second item of this agreement is as follows: "The German Mark of the Soviet occupation zone will be promoted as the single currency in Berlin, and Western Marks will be prohibited from circulation." This item in the August 30th directive has not yet been implemented. Vyshinsky then recalled that, according to the aforementioned two provisions, the commanders of the occupying forces in Germany were instructed to hold consultations in order to "formulate the detailed measures necessary to implement the aforementioned decisions in the shortest possible time." In the Berlin currency issue, the important thing is the management of currency circulation. In the instructions of the four governments, the occupying commanders were informed on this issue that the management of Berlin's currency circulation must be carried out by the German Issuing Bank of the Soviet occupation zone through the existing credit institutions in Berlin that conduct business. Finally, it was stipulated that, in order to supervise the effective implementation of the above-mentioned financial measures related to the exercise and circulation of a single currency in Berlin, a financial committee composed of representatives of the four commanders should be established. Vyshinsky also said that the issue of exercising a single currency in Berlin was the subject of discussion by the United Nations Security Council at the proposal of the United States, Britain, and France. On November 30, 1948, the Security Council instructed the Berlin Currency and Trade Technical Committee to formulate measures and recommendations to help resolve this issue. This committee worked from November 30, 1948, to February 11, 1949. The committee formulated recommendations on December 23, 1948, based on the principles unanimously agreed upon by the four countries, the Soviet Union, the United States, Britain, and France, and reflected in their directives to the four commanders on August 30, 1948.

　　After stating the above opinions, Vyshinsky put forward the Soviet delegation's suggestions on the Berlin currency issue as follows: 1. Exercise a single currency in all of Berlin; 2. In accordance with the joint formulation of Britain, the United States, France, and the Soviet Union, and unanimously agreed upon by the August 30, 1948 directive, recognize the German Mark of the Soviet occupation zone as the single currency of Berlin, and recognize all the consequences indicated in these directives and arising from the same decision; 3. While drafting the terms of activity of the Four-Power Financial Committee and discussing these powers, recognize the recommendations of the Berlin Currency and Trade Expert Technical Committee of December 23, 1948 as the basis.

　　After Vyshinsky spoke, instead of expressing their willingness to reach an agreement on the issue of a single currency in Berlin based on the four-country decision of August 30, 1948, the representatives of the Western countries completely refused to review this issue. Acheson said: The US government "does not consider itself bound by the directive of August 30, 1948." He also asserted: "It is absolutely impossible to implement a single currency system in a divided Berlin." He believes that if an agreement cannot be reached on the administrative issues of Berlin, then discussing the issue of a single currency in Berlin is obviously a waste of time. The French and British representatives agreed with Acheson's opinion.

　　Vyshinsky spoke again, believing that the refusal of the representatives of the Western countries to discuss the issue of a single currency in Berlin was unreasonable. Vyshinsky asked: Why are the delegations of the three countries now so desperately opposed to the foreign ministers' meeting dealing with this issue? Obviously, this is because the delegations of these three countries have already decided on this issue themselves. Obviously, the delegations of the three countries believe that it is necessary to make the division of Berlin permanent, although everyone knows that it is completely contrary to the basic principles of action on the German issue guaranteed by the four countries. Vyshinsky said that the foreign ministers must strive to find a way to reach a consensus at this meeting to solve the problems on the meeting agenda, including the issue of implementing a single currency in Berlin. Only by maintaining a position that deepens and perpetuates the division of Berlin can one refuse to discuss this issue.

　　However, the representatives of the Western countries once again refused to discuss the issue of implementing a single currency in all of Berlin. Not only that, but Acheson also proposed the following suggestion: the third item on the agenda (the issue of preparing a peace treaty with Germany) should also not be discussed, and we can directly go to discuss the fourth item on the agenda (the issue of a peace treaty with Austria). Vyshinsky opposed this suggestion, pointing out that it is impossible to overturn the agenda passed by the foreign ministers' meeting. The agenda decides to discuss the peace treaty with Austria only after discussing issues related to Germany.

### 柏林货币统一问题　苏坚持前四国协议  美英法故意躲避一再拒绝讨论

　　柏林货币统一问题
  　苏坚持前四国协议
    美英法故意躲避一再拒绝讨论
    【新华社北平十一日电】据塔斯社巴黎讯：六月九日，四国外长举行第三周的第四次会议，由美国务卿艾奇逊任主席，历时五小时，英外相贝文在会议将结束时自英国赶回参加。
    外长会议开始时，艾奇逊提议四外长各向其德境占领区占领当局颁发训令，于六月十三日完成现在柏林进行的关于取消柏林与德国西占区以及德国东占区与西占区之间的交通、运输与贸易限制的谈判。法英代表都支持这一提议。苏外长维辛斯基说：苏联方面并没有拖延关于取消对前述限制问题的考虑。在一九四九年五月九日，苏方行政长官所发出的第五十六号命令，就已宣布了取消苏占区当局自一九四八年三月一日所实行的一切限制。然而，不幸的是，在其他的占领区，却没有颁发这样的命令。苏联占领当局完全取消了它自一九四八年三月一日起所实行的限制。在这之后所进行的谈判，关系到某些与取消上述限制和下一事实有关的问题，这一事实就是：我们的代表认为，其他占领区并没有完全撤消限制。维辛斯基说：他已向苏联占领当局询问关于谈判进展的情形，当他接到必要的情报时，将答复艾奇逊的提议。在会议过程中，维辛斯基宣称，他已接获他所要求的情报，并且说，他对艾奇逊的提议没有异议。
    在这次会议上，四国外长按预定计划应继续审议议程的第二项：“柏林与货币问题”。然而，主席艾奇逊企图缩短关于这一问题的讨论，他建议“往下讨论”而保留日后回头讨论第二项议程的权利。维辛斯基反对规避讨论外长会议议程上最重要问题的企图，他提醒会议说：四国政府在纽约所发表的公报，曾确定柏林问题也包括货币问题。本届外长会议在一开始时，也曾决定讨论货币问题。因此，我不仅关心我自己的权利，而且，我并且还关心外长会议中同僚们的义务。
    前四国协议具体内容：苏区德国马克　应为柏林单一货币
    其后，维辛斯基对全柏林单一货币问题阐述了苏联代表团的意见。维辛斯基说：苏联建议审查柏林货币问题时，以四国业已协议的决定为出发点。他指出，在一九四八年八月三十日，苏、美、英、法曾就推行苏占区德国马克于柏林作为单一货币以及禁止西方马克在柏林流通问题获致协议。维辛斯基追述这一协议的内容称：这一协议的第一项，规定取消柏林与西占区之间关于交通、运输与贸易的限制，以及进出苏占区的货运的限制。在这种基础上，随后于一九四九年五月四日达成了协定，并于五月十二日付诸实行。苏占区业已取消了前述限制。因此，一九四八年八月三十日协议的决定，其中第一项业已履行。这一协定第二项如下：“苏占区德国马克，将作为单一货币推行于柏林，西方马克将被禁止流通”。八月三十日指令中的这一项，迄今未付诸实行。维辛斯基继而追溯称，根据前述两项规定，德境各占领军司令曾受命举行会商，以便“在最短期间制定为实现前述决议所必需的详细措施”。在柏林货币问题中，重要的是管理货币流通的问题。在四国政府的指令中，曾就此一问题通知各占领军司令官，柏林货币流通的管理，必须由苏占区德国发行银行以柏林现有执行业务的信用机构为媒介来实行。最后，又规定，为了监督有关柏林单一货币之行使与流通的上述财政措施的切实实行，应当建立由四国司令官代表组成的财政委员会。维辛斯基又说，在柏林行使单一货币问题，是联合国安理会根据美、英、法的提议予以讨论的主题。一九四八年十一月三十日，安理会训令柏林货币与贸易技术委员会拟定有助于解决这一问题的措施和建议。这一委员会从一九四八年十一月三十日一直工作到一九四九年二月十一日。委员会以苏美英法四国一致同意了的和反映在它们于一九四八年八月三十日致四国司令官的指令中的原则为基础，于一九四八年十二月二十三日拟定了建议。
    在申述了上述意见之后，维辛斯基提出苏联代表团关于柏林货币问题的建议如下：一，在全柏林行使单一的货币；二，按照英、美、法、苏四国共同制订并为一九四八年八月三十日指令所一致同意的，承认苏占区德国马克为柏林的单一货币，并承认这些指令中所指出的以及同一决定所产生的一切后果；三，与草订关于四国财政委员会活动的条款和讨论这些职权的同时，承认柏林货币与贸易专家技术委员会一九四八年十二月二十三日的建议作为基础。
    在维辛斯基发言之后，西方国家的代表们不但不表示他们愿意在一九四八年八月三十日四国决定的基础上对柏林单一货币问题达成协议，反而完全拒绝审议这一问题。艾奇逊说：美国政府“并不认为它本身为一九四八年八月三十日的指令所约束。”他又断言：“对分裂的柏林实行单一的货币制度，是绝对不可能的事。”他认为，如果不能在柏林的行政问题上达成协议，那么，讨论柏林单一货币的问题，显然是浪费时间。法英代表附合艾奇逊的意见。
    维辛斯基再度发言，他认为西方国家的代表拒绝讨论柏林单一货币问题是毫无道理的。维辛斯基发问：三国代表团现在为什么这样拼命地反对外长会议处理这一问题呢？显然，这是因为这三个国家的代表团自己已经决定了这个问题，显然三国代表团认为有必要使柏林分裂永久化，虽然每人都明了与四国保证的对德国问题行动的基本原则完全矛盾。维辛斯基说，外长们在本届会议上必须努力寻求一致协议的办法，以解决会议议程上的问题，包括在柏林推行单一货币的问题在内。只有保持使柏林分裂加深和永久化的立场，才可能拒绝讨论这个问题。
    但是，西方国家的代表再次拒绝讨论在全柏林推行单一货币的问题，不仅如此，艾奇逊还提出如下建议：议程的第三项（准备对德和约问题）也不予讨论，可以迳直去讨论议程的第四项（对奥和约问题）。维辛斯基反对这一建议，他指出，不可能推翻外长会议所通过的议程。议程决定在讨论了有关德国的问题之后才讨论对奥和约。
