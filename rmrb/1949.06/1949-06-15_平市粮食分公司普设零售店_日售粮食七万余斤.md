　　Ping City Grain Branch Universally Establishes Retail Stores
  　Daily Sales of Grain Exceed 70,000 Jin
    [Our Newspaper] The Ping City Trading Company's Grain Branch has achieved considerable success in universally supplying food grain to citizens by directly establishing business offices and retail stores. As of now, it has successively established 34 distribution agencies, initially taking over the business of commissioned private merchants. The Grain Branch originally commissioned private merchants to process and sell grain. After repeatedly discovering that the commissioned private merchants were engaging in adulteration, theft, false reporting, and other behaviors, the business policy was changed in mid-May, and the establishment of direct business premises and retail stores was started to take over the business of private merchant sales. Significant progress has been made in the past month: 12 business offices and 22 retail stores have been successively established, and the remaining 140-plus commissioned stores that survived repeated eliminations have all been canceled due to the universal establishment of business offices and retail stores. The business of each business office and retail store is developing daily. According to statistics from the first ten days of June (1st to 10th), 32 units sold a total of more than 730,000 jin of grain in ten days, with an average of more than 70,000 jin of grain being directly sold to consuming citizens daily. According to statistics from various business offices and retail stores, the majority of buyers are laborers, poor people, and peddlers, and there are also some general citizens. In order to prevent speculation, trafficking, and hoarding, and to broaden the supply, the company restricts purchases to self-consumption, limiting each person to 10 jin per day. The types of grain sold by each selling unit are mostly complete, including Temple of Heaven brand vermicelli, Camel brand fine flour, No. 1 and No. 2 fine flour, Northeast sorghum rice, Volcanic Field millet, Northeast millet, Fine millet, corn flour, millet flour, buckwheat flour, and more than ten other varieties. The selling price is usually (when grain prices are stable) about 4% lower than the retail price of private merchants. When grain prices fluctuate, it is 10% to 20% lower.　　　　　　　OnFileChange

　　平市粮食分公司普设零售店
  　日售粮食七万余斤
    【本报讯】北平贸易公司粮食分公司为普遍供应市民食粮，采取直接设立营业处暨零售店已有相当成绩，截至目前已陆续建立了三十四个发售机构，初步接替了委托私商代销的业务。粮食分公司零售食粮，原系委托私商加工代销，在接二连三发现代销私商有掺杂、盗卖、虚报等行为后，曾于五月中旬改变了业务方针，开始建立直接营业处所、零售店以接替私商代销的业务，一个月来已有显著的成绩：陆续建立了十二个营业处和二十二个零售店，经过屡次淘汰而残存的一百四十余家代销店，由于营业处和零售店普遍的设立也全部取消了。各营业处零售店之业务均日见开展，根据六月上旬（一至十日）的统计，十天内三十二个单位共售粮七十三万余斤，平均每日有七万多斤粮食直接卖给消费的市民。据各营业处暨零售店统计，前往购买者以劳动工人、贫民、小贩最多，亦有部分一般市民。该公司为防止套购、贩卖、囤积，以使供应面广阔，购买者均限自食，每人每日限买十斤。各售卖单位所售之粮种，大部齐全，计有天坛牌通粉、骆驼牌口粉、一、二号口粉、东北高粱米、伏地小米、东北小米、口小米、玉米面、小米面、荞面等十余种。售价平时（指粮价平稳时）较私商零售价低约百分之四。遇有粮价波动时则低百分之十至二十不等。　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　（宇）
