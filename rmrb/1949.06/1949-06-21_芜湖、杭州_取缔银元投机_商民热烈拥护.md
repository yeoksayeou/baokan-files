    Wuhu, Hangzhou
    Suppression of Silver Dollar Speculation, Warmly Supported by Merchants and People
    [Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, 20th] The people of Wuhu are enthusiastically assisting the People's Government in suppressing the activities of silver dollar speculators who are disrupting the financial system. Fifty-six representatives of workers from the city held a forum at the Youth Club on the 13th. They unanimously resolved to assist the government with resolute action and report unscrupulous merchants engaged in silver dollar speculation. Students from major middle schools also organized propaganda teams, conducting publicity campaigns against the use of silver dollars in major streets of the city starting on the 14th. At a forum convened by the Municipal Government and the Military Control Commission's Finance Department with representatives of merchants and people, more than one hundred merchant representatives expressed their support for the government's measures. Over a thousand shops throughout the city have signed a covenant to refuse the use of silver dollars, with the words "This shop refuses to use silver dollars" prominently displayed in front of their stores. Citizens are actively exchanging their silver dollars at the People's Bank. The economic task force organized by the Municipal Government and the Garrison Command uncovered illegally carried silver dollars totaling 1,485 pieces on the 12th and 13th.
    Furthermore: A movement to refuse the use of silver dollars has also been launched by people from all walks of life in Hangzhou. Most staff and workers said that they should take the lead in not buying silver dollars, because buying silver dollars can only maintain temporary benefits, and the resulting price fluctuations still leave them at a disadvantage.

    取缔银元投机  商民热烈拥护
    【新华社南京二十日电】芜湖人民热烈协助人民政府取缔银元投机商捣乱金融的活动。全市工人代表五十六人于十三日在青年俱乐部举行座谈会。一致决议以坚决行动协助政府，检举进行银元投机的奸商。各大中学学生亦组织宣传小组，于十四日起在市区各重要街道，进行拒用银元的宣传。在市政府和军管会财经部所召集的商民代表座谈会上，一百多个商民代表都表示拥护政府措施。全市千余家商店已订立拒用银元之公约，商店门前，都贴着“本号拒用银元”六个大字。市民则纷纷自动以银元向人民银行进行兑换。市政府和警备司令部组织的经济工作队，十二、十三两日查获非法携用的银元计一千四百八十五枚。
    又讯：杭州市各界人民也掀起了拒用银元的运动。一般职工都表示要首先自动地不买银元，因为买银元只能保持暂时的利益，而结果物价波动还是自己吃亏。
