　　Tangshan Cooperative General Office Emphasizes Employee Benefits
    [Our Newspaper's Report] The Tangshan City Supply and Marketing Cooperative General Office, the People's Bank branch, and the Trade Company branch worked together to support the workers correctly when prices in Tangshan City fluctuated drastically. When various factories and mines issued wages, they allocated daily necessities such as cloth and grain to the employees at a low price. Most of the currency was recovered before it could be invested in the market, which played a role in stabilizing prices and ensured that the wages earned by the employees of various factories and mines were not lost.
    At the end of April, Tangshan's prices were severely affected by Tianjin and manipulated by unscrupulous merchants, fluctuating greatly. At this time, the Kailuan Mining Bureau was issuing three months of accumulated wages to workers, which was a substantial amount. In addition, other factories such as Qixin, Huaxin, the railway and its machine factory, and the steel plant successively issued wages. According to the market situation of price fluctuations at that time, injecting a large amount of currency would further stimulate price increases. To support the currency and ensure that the wages earned by workers were not lost, the Tangshan Cooperative, Trade Company, and Bank decided after a meeting that the Bank would prepare 15,000 bolts of Yangguang white cloth and 700,000 catties of corn, and the Trade Company would prepare a large number of materials such as pasta and millet and corn. The cooperative allocated personnel to carry out distribution. Every day, based on the market situation, the three units exchanged opinions and jointly set appropriate standard prices lower than the market price for large-scale sales; the Bank vigorously called for practical savings to absorb the floating capital of workers' wages. The distribution started on May 4th and lasted for 18 days until May 21st, targeting the employees of factories and mines such as Kailuan Mine, Qixin Cement Company, the railway, the railway machine factory, the steel plant, and Huaxin Textile Factory. The Tangshan City Supply and Marketing Cooperative General Office and the Linxi Branch Office sold a total of 6,542 bolts of Yangguang white cloth, 249,496 catties of Yuan corn, 127,046 catties of white corn, 58,782 catties of sorghum rice, 35,295 catties of millet, and 1,493 bags of flour; recovering a total of 71,864,687 yuan. The price of each type of goods distributed was on average more than 10% cheaper than the market price. This distribution work has had a very good impact among the employees of various factories and mines in Tangshan. Most workers said: If the state had not supported the workers this time, the workers would have suffered a great loss. If it weren't for the government selling us Yangguang cloth for 7,500 yuan (the first day's distribution price) per bolt, we wouldn't be able to buy it for 15,000 yuan outside. (仲)

  　唐市合作总社重视职工福利
    【本报讯】唐山市供销合作总社、人民银行分行及贸易分公司通力合作，当唐市物价波动剧烈，各厂矿发薪时，正确地支持了工人，对各厂矿职工廉价配售布匹、粮食等日用品，将大部分货币未容投入市场，即行收回，起了平稳物价作用，使各厂矿职工所得工资未受损失。
    四月底唐市物价受天津影响及奸商操纵，波动甚烈，此时正值开滦矿务局发与工人三个月的积欠工薪，为数颇巨。又加其他各工厂如启新、华新、铁路及其机厂、制钢厂等相继发薪。按当时物价波动之市场情况，如再投入大批货币，将更要刺激物价上涨。唐市合作社、贸易公司、银行等为了支持货币，保证工人所得工资不受损失，经开会决定，由银行准备阳光白布一万五千匹、玉米七十万斤，贸易公司准备通粉及小米，玉米等大批物资，通过合作社配备人员进行配售。每日针对市场情况，由该三单位交换意见后共同定出适当低于市价之标准价格，大量出售；银行大力号召折实储蓄，吸收职工人员所得工薪的游资。由五月四日开始配售，至五月廿一日，先后在开滦矿、启新洋灰公司、铁路、铁路机厂、制钢厂、华新纱厂等厂矿的职工为对象售货十八天。唐市供销合作社总社及林西分社合计共售出阳光白布六五四二匹，元玉米二四九四九六斤，白玉米一二七○四六斤，秫米五八七八二斤，小米三五二九五斤，面粉一四九三袋；共收回金额七一八六四六八七元。配售之各样货品价较市价平均便宜百分之十以上。此次配售工作在唐山各厂矿职工中起了极好的反映。大部分工人说：这次如果不是国家支持工人，恐怕工人要吃很大的亏。要没有政府卖给我们七千五百元（第一天配售价）一匹的阳光布，在外边花一万五千元也买不到。　　　　　　　　（仲）
