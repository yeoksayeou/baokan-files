　　Received Warm Welcome and Hospitality All the Way
  　Humbly Learning from Soviet Economics
  　Letter from Our Trade Union Delegation from the Soviet Capital
    [Our Newspaper Dispatch] The All-China Federation of Trade Unions has just received a quick letter from the Chinese delegation attending the Second Congress of the World Federation of Trade Unions, sent from Moscow, the Soviet capital, reporting on the delegation's journey abroad. The letter stated: When our delegation arrived at Otp (the first station on the Soviet border) on the 6th, the Soviet Union had already sent a special train from Chita. The chairman of the Chita Provincial Trade Union was already waiting here. Food had already been prepared in the dining car. Everyone boarded the train, had lunch, and then the train departed. At 11:00 AM on the 7th, we arrived in Chita, where the Deputy Chairman of the Chita Municipal People's Committee and Comrades Ilshov and Milan, representatives sent by the All-Union Central Council of Trade Unions from Moscow, were waiting at the station. They happily said: The plane is already waiting for you at the airport. We immediately took a car to the airport and arrived in Moscow at 12:30 PM on the 8th. Goudkov, the Director of the International Department of the All-Union Central Council of Trade Unions, and others came to meet us. On the 11th, we met with Kuznetsov, Chairman of the All-Union Central Council of Trade Unions. By the 12th, the Asian report that the Chinese delegation was preparing for the World Federation of Trade Unions Congress had been translated, and the speeches for the hardware, textile, railway, postal and telecommunications, leather, coal mining, and seafarer sectors had also been drafted. The delegation's style of observing discipline and working diligently in the Soviet Union has been repeatedly praised by people here; the delegation itself has also redoubled its efforts, formulated a study plan, and is humbly learning from the valuable experience of the Soviet Union. The delegation members are in high spirits of hard work and study. After a short stay in the Soviet Union, we flew to Czechoslovakia on the 14th.
