　　New Comic Book Creation Symposium
    Qi Ya
    In order to create new comic books, the Publishing Committee, together with the Dazhong Fine Arts Agency, specially invited more than 20 art workers in Beiping on the 14th of this month to discuss and study the issue. Everyone exchanged many valuable opinions on the creation, publication, and distribution of comic books, and unanimously agreed that this work should, on the one hand, mobilize art workers to create more new content comic books, and on the other hand, organize and transform the old comic book artists and publishers. On the one hand, new content comic books must be created as demonstrations; on the other hand, the advantages of the old comic books, especially in terms of form and technique, must be carefully studied. Everyone unanimously expressed their willingness to work hard for this. On the 21st of this month, based on the previous opinions, discussions were held again, and a preliminary creation plan was drafted and the work was divided. The first step is to prepare for the publication of 20 works, of which three-quarters will be new subjects, one-quarter will be historical subjects, three-quarters will fully utilize the old form, and one-quarter will create new forms. After everyone's deliberation, in order to avoid duplication, a self-reporting and public discussion method was adopted, and more than 20 kinds of works were determined, such as "New Children's Heroes," "The White Haired Girl," "Wang Xiuluan," "The Story of Liu Hulan," "Heroes of Lüliang," "South China Guerrilla," "Nine Pieces of Clothing," etc. In the future, they will be published by the Dazhong Fine Arts Agency, and extensive submissions will be solicited. Submissions can be sent to the Dazhong Fine Arts Agency c/o the Publishing Committee, No. 75 Sifabu Street, this city.

　　创作新小人书座谈会
    启亚
    出版委员会为了创作新小人书，于本月十四日特由该会和大众美术社邀请在平美术工作者二十余人座谈研究，大家交换了关于创作、出版、发行小人书的许多宝贵意见，一致认为这一工作，一面须发动美术工作者多多创作新内容的小人书，一面更应该去组织改造旧的小人书画家与出版家。一方面须创作新内容的小人书作为示范；另方面须很好的学习旧小人书方面特别在形式技术上的一切优点，大家一致愿为这一工作而努力。至本月二十一日即根据上次意见再度讨论，并拟订了初步的创作计划，进行了分工，第一步准备出版二十部，内以四分之三为新题材，四分之一为历史题材，四分之三完全利用旧形式，四分之一创作新形式，经过大家酝酿，为了免于重复，采取自报公议方式，确定了“新儿女英雄传”，“白毛女”，“王秀鸾”，“刘胡兰的故事”，“吕梁英雄传”，“华南游击队”，“九件衣”……等二十余种，将来交大众美术社出版，并进行广泛征稿，来稿可寄本市司法部街七十五号出版委员会转大众美术社。
