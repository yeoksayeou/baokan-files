    Taihang Trading Company Fourth Branch
    Supports the Sulphur Industry in Bo'ai Rural Areas
    [Taihang News] The Fourth Branch of Taihang Trading Company is vigorously supporting the rural sulfur industry in Bo'ai. There were originally eight villages in the area producing sulfur, with a total of forty-nine sulfur kilns. However, sales had not been resolved for a long time. This year, with the assistance of the trading company, from April 22nd to May 17th, in 26 days, the number of kilns developed to 101. Some kilns have completed their production plans ahead of schedule. For example, in Xifengfeng Village, the original plan was to produce 12,000 jin of sulfur by the end of May, but by May 17th, they had already completed 12,230 jin. The trading company's support methods are: signing contracts with various villages, guaranteeing the sale of finished products from the sulfur kilns. And deciding on two methods, barter (one jin of sulfur exchanged for three jin of wheat), and cash purchase, for the masses to freely choose. At the same time, it was determined that existing sulfur stocks could also be exchanged at the trading company. This spring, the masses lacked food, and most people exchanged sulfur for wheat, which played a significant role in overcoming the famine.

    太行贸易公司四分公司
    扶植博爱农村硫磺业
    【太行讯】太行贸易公司四分公司，大力扶助博爱农村硫磺业。该地原有八个村产磺，共有磺窑四十九座。但销路长期未得解决。今年在贸易公司扶助下，从四月二十二日到五月十七日，二十六天中，就发展到一百零一座。有些窑已提前完成生产计划。如西冯封村，原计划到五月底生产硫磺一万二千斤，但到五月十七日就完成了一万二千二百三十斤。贸易公司扶助办法是：与各村订立合同，保证给磺窑推销成品。并决定实物交换（一斤磺换三斤麦子），及折款收买两种办法，由群众自由选择。同时确定旧存硫磺同样可到贸易公司交换。今春群众缺粮，多数人都以磺换麦，对生产渡荒起了很大作用。
