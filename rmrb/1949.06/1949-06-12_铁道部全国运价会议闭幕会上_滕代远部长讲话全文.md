Comrades: The conference convened to unify national freight rates has successfully resolved all the issues after 21 days of research and discussion. Taking advantage of today's closing ceremony, I will explain a few points for your reference when you return to your posts to implement them.

As we know, in the past, in the five major liberated areas of Northeast, North China, Northwest, East China, and Central Plains, our railways had to be managed separately in each liberated area due to enemy division and blockade, in order to coordinate military, political, economic, and cultural struggles against the enemy. The complete liberation of each liberated area was not consistent in time. This situation was also reflected in the railway sector: In the Northeast, a portion of the railways was taken over after August 15th. In the North, the liberation of Shijiazhuang came first, and we had the Shijiazhuang-Taiyuan and Shijiazhuang-Dezhou lines. In Handan, we built a section ourselves. After the liberation of Jinan, we had the Jinan Railway Bureau. The liberation of Kaifeng and Zhengzhou led to the establishment of the Zhengzhou Railway Bureau. Finally, with the liberation of Tianjin and Beijing, the Pingjin Railway Bureau was established. Due to the different times of liberation, our Northeast and North China Railway Bureaus also had different freight rates, miscellaneous fees, cargo grades, transportation rules, and supplements in passenger and freight operations. Today, the Military Commission's Ministry of Railways has been established for four months, and it deeply feels the urgent need to unify dispatching, management, operations, and freight rates. Therefore, it was decided to convene a dispatching conference and a freight rate conference in May. Now, the Northeast, North China, and South China are connected as a whole, and all railways across the country will be liberated. It is currently estimated that the Huai River Bridge on the Tianjin-Pukou Railway will be completed on July 1st, or even earlier on June 20th. Due to heavy rains, the repair of the Zhengzhou-Hankou section is under threat, but it may also be open to traffic by the end of June. Our military transport was completed ahead of schedule on May 25th. This was a large-scale transport in history. The organization of this military transport was very good, and there were no explosions or casualties. This is very satisfying. In our passenger and freight operations, the Northeast, due to currency and price issues, has different basic rates. Other aspects, such as freight rate tapering, adjacent grade percentages, cargo names, grades, transportation rules, and supplements, are also different. Because the development of the railway situation urgently requires us to move towards unification, passenger trains have been running directly between Tianjin and Bengbu on the Tianjin-Pukou line since June 1st. Soon, with the restoration of the Huai River Bridge, passenger and freight transport on all lines in the South and North will be directly connected. Under these circumstances, failure to unify will not only inconvenience passengers and cargo owners, but also make it difficult for railway employees to perform their duties, and it will also easily lead to malpractices.

What are the current freight rates and passenger and freight rules of the various railway administrations?

(1) Freight Rates and Miscellaneous Fees:

A. Freight Rates—Before April 25th, passenger fares in the North China bureaus were different. The Zhengzhou Bureau charged as much as 2.5 yuan per person per kilometer, while the Pingjin Bureau charged as little as 0.7 yuan. On April 25th, the Ministry of Railways submitted a request to the Central Military Commission for approval to unify the rate at 2 yuan. However, the freight rates for full carload, less-than-carload, luggage, and parcels have not yet been unified. As shown in the attached table:

└─────┴────┴────┴────┴─────┴───┴──┘

From the above table, the Pingjin Bureau has the lowest freight rates, and the Tongpu Bureau has the highest, followed by the Jinan Bureau. The Central Plains Finance Office and the Northwest Liberated Area have proposed transporting materials from the Central Plains to Tianjin and from Shijiazhuang to Tongpu. However, they felt that the freight rates were too high and there were no tapering rates, which illustrates the situation where the lack of unified freight rates, with high and low rates, affects the flow of goods. Therefore, it is urgent to unify freight rates. This task cannot be solved by the various bureaus and must be resolved uniformly by the Military Commission's Ministry of Railways.

B. Miscellaneous Fees—Loading and unloading fees: The Pingjin Bureau charges ten yuan to load one piece of luggage, while the Shijiazhuang Bureau charges six liang of millet for one parcel and four liang of millet for luggage. The Pingjin Bureau charges 40 yuan per ton for loading or unloading full carload of goods, while the Shijiazhuang Bureau charges 10.05 yuan. Other fees, such as cargo storage fees, switching fees, and modification fees, are also different in the various North China bureaus.

(2) Freight Rate Structure:

A. Tapering Rates—Northeast Railway reduces freight rates by 42.6% after 2000 kilometers, and passenger fares by 42%. Except for the Shijiazhuang Bureau, which has special rates for coal transportation, the other North China bureaus do not have tapering rates. In the past, when the Jiaoji Railway had not yet been repaired, Jinan needed coal from the Zibo mining area, which had to be transported little by little by ox carts and horse carts. The Shijiazhuang Bureau wanted to transport coal from Yangquan to Jinan, but it was impossible because the freight rates were too high. Therefore, this method is not appropriate because it cannot encourage long-distance transportation of goods. In the future, we must encourage exports and exchange them for the materials and equipment we need. We must transport the things that the people need at low prices over long distances. If the railway has deviations in freight rates, it will not be able to correctly develop this kind of long-distance transportation.

B. Grade Ratios—The Northeast Railway divides goods into ten grades, with the first grade being 360 times the rate of the tenth grade. However, the Northern bureaus currently divide them into five grades, with the first grade being five times the fifth grade. The North is still using the old method from the Kuomintang period. With this difference in grades, those who transport first and second-grade goods benefit. The so-called first and second-grade goods are mostly consumables, luxury goods, silk, and the like, which are transported by wealthy people. The cost of transporting the daily necessities of the working people is relatively high. This violates our policy and is beneficial to big landlords and big bourgeoisie. The Kuomintang's railway was dedicated to serving these people, but we are not. Why did we still use the Kuomintang's method before? Because we had no experience, no good research, and no communication with the Northeast. Now that we have communicated with the Northeast, we should change it immediately. If we continue to do so, we will not be able to adapt to the economic policy of the New Democracy. Now, after research, a new freight rate plan has been made, which can be said to be a revolution in freight rates.

The Second Plenary Session of our Party clearly pointed out that the focus of work in the future will shift from the countryside to the cities, and the consuming cities must be transformed into producing cities. Chairman Mao told us that production should be increased by an inch. In the future, restoring and developing production will be regarded as the focus of all work. We must thoroughly implement this policy in the railway freight rate policy to quickly restore and develop industry and agriculture.

(3) Cargo Grades:

The current cargo grading in the Northeast divides cargo into ten grades, while the Northern bureaus currently divide them into five grades. Due to price fluctuations, the burden on goods in the Northeast has changed differently from before. Today, Pingjin, Jinan, Zhengzhou, and Shijiazhuang still use the Kuomintang's grades, which is very inappropriate. For example, they put flour, soybeans, millet, and sorghum rice in the same fourth-grade category. Comparing the freight rates and prices in Beijing in mid-April, the transportation cost for 500 kilometers accounted for 4.79% of the flour price, 8.24% of the soybean price, 6.26% of the millet price, and 6.56% of the sorghum rice price. Coal: The transportation cost for Kailuan coal over 500 kilometers accounts for 25.36% of the price, while Mentougou coal accounts for 58.33%. According to the above situation, they bear unequal burdens, which is very inappropriate. Therefore, cargo grades need to be re-established. The more grades, the more reasonable. The socialist country of the Soviet Union was divided into seventeen grades after the October Revolution, and now it has been divided into 110 grades. Our current conditions do not allow us to divide into so many grades. This meeting decided that we will temporarily divide into 20 grades.

(4) Passenger and Freight Transport Rules and Supplements:

The Northern bureaus do not yet have a relatively complete set of rules. After more than three years of practical work and several revisions to passenger and freight rules, the Northeast Railway today has a set of regulations. However, we must admit that the Sino-Soviet Railway has played a leading role in the achievements of the Northeast Railway, but we cannot completely move the rules of the Northeast to the Northern or Southern railways for application. We still need to make appropriate modifications to make it suitable for the whole country.

During this meeting, comrades worked tirelessly day and night. Two comrades fell ill. I would like to express my condolences to their enthusiasm for work here. After everyone's group research and discussion, the above unreasonable and ununified phenomena have been resolved. The meeting formulated unified national cargo grades, unified cargo technical loading tonnage, unified national freight rate structure, formulated Northeast passenger and freight rate rates, drafted the Provisional Regulations on People's Railway Transportation, proposed opinions on formulating national passenger and freight transportation rules, and drafted national passenger and freight transportation rules for the current transition period. From the above, this meeting has been fruitful. Another major gain is that comrades have reached a unified understanding of the unification of passenger and freight regulations. In the past, in the Northeast or other bureaus, there were often different interpretations of the same issue in the regulations, which often led to errors in handling specific matters.

The People's Liberation War will soon achieve national victory. The productive forces of the people in the liberated areas have been liberated, and the whole country will carry out extensive economic construction work. Therefore, a large number of materials and passengers will need railway transportation. How will our comrades handling passenger and freight operations meet this glorious task?

(1) In business operations, as in scheduling, the responsibility system should be further promoted: Railway business accidents often occur. In the past, during the puppet Manchukuo period, in 1937, business accidents accounted for 55.83% per hundred kilometers, and in 1942, 37.38% per hundred kilometers. Our Northeast Railway in 1948 was 22% per hundred kilometers, and in 1949 (January to March) it was 13% per hundred kilometers. From these figures, our business accidents have been reduced a lot, but we cannot say that we have no serious shortcomings. For example, in March, the Northeast Railway shipped sweet potatoes from Xiongyuecheng to Zhalantun, and due to backlog, they were completely damaged upon arrival, and the railway compensated 13 million yuan. Datun Station does not handle full carload of goods, but Yushutun mistakenly handled it. It was discovered at Changchun Station, resulting in a backlog of freight cars for more than ten days. The Ministry of Military Industry transported a carload of Class A explosives from Hailar. The cargo owner asked how much it would cost. Our station staff told the Ministry of Military Industry the old freight rate. After loading the car, the freight was calculated according to the new freight rate, and it turned out to be much more. As a result, the cargo owner did not ship the goods and requested the Railway Bureau to compensate for the loss. In the Pingjin Bureau, there are also many errors in missing entries on freight bills. According to a recent report from the Public Security Bureau, one person smuggled 1,000 kilograms of explosives, falsely declaring them as ordinary goods for shipment, and was discovered by our public security organs. If we can be very responsible for inspection at the originating station, these contraband items cannot be transported. This is something that should be raised and taken seriously! Also, recently, an incident occurred at Tangshan Station. Before the train departed, a woman carried a sack and wanted to board the train. She was stopped by our public security police, and she left the sack and boarded the train. After inspection, the sack was completely filled with detonators. We must be vigilant against these destructive elements and reactionary conspiracies. The errors that occur in the business operations of other bureaus are probably not few. We can only reduce or eliminate these accidents by implementing a responsibility system in business operations.

(2) Handling responsible transportation: Responsible transportation by the railway is of great convenience to cargo owners, but today it is not possible to fully handle responsible transportation due to railway equipment reasons. But we must strive to ensure that all Northern and Southern bureaus achieve responsible transportation of luggage, parcels, and less-than-carload goods in 1949. In addition to the current responsible transportation of luggage, parcels, and less-than-carload goods, the Northeast Railway will achieve responsible transportation of some full carload goods in 1949, such as wood, sleepers, coal, etc. The former Railway Column consigned sleepers for repairing the line, but they were backlogged en route due to the failure to implement responsible transportation, which affected the progress of the project. Now, the Northeast Dongxing Company has established a car escort team for escorting full carload of goods. If our Northeast can implement partial responsible transportation, the state's expenses can be reduced a lot, so responsible transportation is very beneficial to both cargo owners and the state.

(3) Railway's relationship with cargo owners and passengers: Today, the railway belongs to the people, which is different from the railways run by bureaucratic capitalists in the past. To run the people's railway well, it mainly depends on the broad masses of employees cherishing it, protecting it as everyone cherishes their own eyes, because today we are the masters of the railway. On the other hand, it also depends on passengers and cargo owners cherishing the railway. It is very important for the railway to have a good relationship with passengers and cargo owners, because our comrades who handle passenger and freight operations often come into contact with passengers and cargo owners. Due to the different levels of awareness of our employees, individual employees do not have a strong service attitude towards passengers and cargo owners, and the mutual relationship in some places is still not normal. Some problems here need to be solved urgently.

(1) Some comrades do not know that the value of the railway lies in absorbing a large number of cargo owners and passengers to use railway transportation. Instead of wholeheartedly serving passengers and cargo owners, they wrongly believe that the railway is a monopolistic enterprise and that long-distance goods or passengers cannot do without the railway. Based on this wrong view, they often show an arrogant style, are indifferent in attitude, are afraid of trouble, only know how to collect fines when cargo owners and passengers violate the rules, do not think of ways to solve the problems, and deal with things perfunctorily. They also do not reflect or ask for solutions to problems that are not stipulated in the rules. For example, on March 2, Comrade Tian Kungang consigned 2.8 million yuan of People's Bank Notes from Tianjin Station to the Northeast to purchase medicines. After arriving at Tianjin Station, the stationmaster on duty, Bao Deyong, said that it could not be consigned, and he replied in writing that the railway has an order that consigning more than 20 kilograms of currency requires proof from the local party and government organs and the people's government. Comrade Tian had to run to the Industry and Commerce Bureau of the People's Government Military Control Commission many times to obtain the certificate. In fact, this order was stipulated during the Kuomintang period, and our People's Railway does not have this provision. Bao Deyong's undiscerning handling is so harmful.

If we go to a private agency, we will see how diligently the owner of the agency treats the merchants. Although we do not need to learn their extravagant hypocrisy, their diligent attitude towards merchants is worth learning.

There are also some comrades in our stations who only know how to work at home and do not know how to go out to find cargo owners. They only give people transportation when cargo owners come to our door. The above are some bad phenomena.

But some places have already made very good achievements, which is worthy of praise. The freight comrades of the Harbin Bureau and Binjiang Station took the initiative to find cargo owners in the city to transport goods, increasing railway revenue by 200 million Northeast currency. Zhaodong Station recruited merchants in the city, resulting in more than 300 cars of transportation. Shanchahe Station took the initiative to find merchants in the city, resulting in more than 80 cars of transportation. They have all received bonuses. This spirit of serving the people and working methods are worthy of learning by our other bureaus and stations, and should be greatly promoted.

(2) What was the relationship between the railways and cargo owners and passengers when the Kuomintang and Japanese imperialism ruled China? Only the railway was allowed to fine cargo owners and passengers, and cargo owners and passengers were not allowed to fine the railway for losses caused by the railway. Today, we are the People's Railway. Not only do we have the right to require cargo owners and passengers to abide by the regulations, but we also have the obligation to accept the supervision of cargo owners and passengers. For example, if the delivery of goods is delayed due to the railway and losses occur, or if the express train exceeds the late time approved by the state, the railway will also be fined and refunded. This article is clearly stipulated in the provisional regulations of the People's Railway that we drafted this time and in the current passenger and freight regulations of the Northeast. This is fair and reasonable. The railway should become a model of compliance. Only in this way can our work move forward.

(4) Work Style: In addition to having a tenacious, practical, and responsible work style, our comrades who handle business operations should also have an incorruptible work style. In the past, during the Japanese rule of the railway, there was a saying in the society about people who handled passenger and freight operations: "Poor transportation, rich goods, neither poor nor rich small items." Of course, there were also incorruptible people in this, but these people were not praised at that time. Today, the vast majority of employees have recognized that this statement is a shameful satire, but it cannot be said that every employee has this awareness. There have also been incidents of corruption, bribery, and theft. In the future, in order to cultivate an incorruptible work style, we must conduct good education for our railway employees, especially for the comrades in the new areas. A few days ago, our Finance Bureau had more than 200 rolls of khaki cloth dyed badly at a dyeing factory in Tianjin. Afterwards, our comrades proposed to ask him for compensation. When our comrades were not paying attention, he put a swimming watch in his pocket, but this watch could not buy our railway employees. Our comrades did not accept it. This not only educated the merchant, but also showed the difference in the work style of the employees of the People's Railway today.

(5) Learning: The railway industry is developing rapidly. We should learn well. Chairman Mao told us: "We must be elementary school students of the people, learn from the masses, learn from our friends, and also learn from our enemies." Every railway employee should not be satisfied with today's technology and today's experience. The advanced socialist country of the Soviet Union has 150,000 kilometers of railways and 170 million people, but their railway employees have exceeded 3 million. We have 470 million people, and the railway is only 26,000 kilometers long, with only 300,000 railway employees, which is very insufficient. We have only more than 4,000 engineers in the country. If we want to add 15,000 kilometers of railways in the near future, we will need 40,000 experts. We must summarize work experience and learn from the experience of advanced socialist countries such as the Soviet Union in managing railways. The Kuomintang and the United States, Britain, and Japan, their railways serve the big bourgeoisie and big landlords, and all their methods in business operations are also in line with the interests of these rulers. The railways of the Soviet Union and ours belong to the people. Of course, we must use them according to our actual situation and make them concrete. Some of our comrades have doubts about absorbing the experience of advanced countries such as the Soviet Union in managing railways, and even resist it, which is very wrong. Another is a right-wing manifestation, which is to believe and accept without criticism some of the methods and freight rate methods of capitalist countries and the Kuomintang in managing railway business operations, which is also wrong. Still another manifestation is conservatism and satisfaction with the status quo. These all show that our comrades still need to strengthen their learning in politics and business. Today is an era of the people. Comrades who are employees in the people's railway transportation posts, no matter where they come from, should change today and study hard in order to successfully shoulder the glorious task of the people's railway.

Our meeting has ended. The above is what I said, as a reference for everyone to go back and implement the unified freight rate regulations and systems. The main basis for formulating national freight rates this time is the price index of various places. I hope that everyone will go back and sort out the price index for May and report it to the Ministry. I also hope that everyone will go back and convene cadres to convey the spirit of the conference. It is not enough to do so only within the railway bureau. We must also carry out effective publicity to passengers and merchants about our newly formulated freight rate regulations and methods.

　　铁道部全国运价会议闭幕会上
  　滕代远部长讲话全文
    一九四九年六月七日
    同志们：为统一全国运价所召开的会议，经过二十一天的研究讨论，已胜利地使要解决的问题都获得解决，趁今天会议结束，我来说明几个问题，作为同志们回去执行的参考。
    我们知道，过去我们在东北、华北、西北、华东及中原五大解放区中，由于敌人的分割封锁，我们的铁路不能不在各解放区分别管理，以便配合军事政治经济文化与敌进行斗争。各解放区完全解放的先后不一致，这种情形表现在铁路方面也是一样：东北铁路在八一五以后便已接管一部，北方地区首先是石家庄的解放，我们有了石太和石德线，在邯郸我们自己修建了一段，济南解放后，我们有了济南局，开封、郑州的解放，有了郑州局，最后平津解放，成立了平津局。由于解放时间先后不同，我们东北、北方各铁路局在客货运营业上，亦各有不同的运价杂费、不同的货物等级、不同的运输规则及补则。今天军委铁道部成立了已四个月，深感调度、管理、营业、运价各方面都极需要统一，因此决定五月召开调度会议、运价会议。现在东北、北方、南方已经连成一片，全国铁路都将获得解放，现在预计津浦线淮河桥七月一日或六月二十日提前完成，郑州至汉口一段因大雨关系抢修感受威胁，将可能亦于六月底通车。我们的军运提前在五月二十五日完成，这是历史上大规模的运输，这次军运组织很好，没有发生一次爆炸或伤人的事故，这是很令人满意的。我们在客货运营业上，东北因币制物价关系，定有不同的基本费率，其他如运价递远递减率，邻等百分比，货物品名，等级，运输规则及补则。由于铁路发展的形势迫切要求我们走向统一，六月一日起津浦线天津、蚌埠间旅客列车已办理直通，不久淮河大桥修复，南方与北方各路客货运都将实行直通运输。在这种情况下，再不统一，便不能便利旅客货主，铁路职工执行工作也有困难，同时容易发生流弊。
    各管理局现行的运价和客货运规则是怎么样呢？
    （一）运价杂费：
    甲、运价方面——北方各局旅客票价，在四月二十五日以前，各局都不相同，每人每公里多的如郑州局订为二元五角，少的如平津局订为七角，四月二十五日铁道部呈请中央军委批准统一改为二元，但是整车货物，零担货物，行李，包裹运价都还没有统一。如附表：┌─────┬──　─┬────┬────┬─────┬──────┐│同　蒲　局│郑州　局│济南局  │石家庄局│平　津　局│局  价　  项││　　　　　│　　　　│　　　　│　　　　│　　　　　│别　率　　别│├─────┼────┼────┼────┼─────┼───┬──┤│　　　　　│　　　　│　　　　│　　　　│　　　　　│公　行│ 　 ││          │        │        │        │          │斤　李│ 客 ││ 0．40    │ 0 ．28 │0 ．26  │ 0 ．26 │0 ．20  元│每（每│  　││    　　　│　　　　│　　　　│　　　　│　　　　　│公　十│　　││　　　　　│　　　　│　　　　│　　　　│　　　　　│里）　│    │├─────┼────┼────┼────┼─────┼───┤ 　 ││          │        │        │        │ 按径行距 │公　包│　　││          │        │        │        │ 离收一张 │斤　裹│　  ││　5．50 　│  0．40 │  0．30 │  0．26 │   票 价  │每（每│ 运 ││          │        │        │        │          │公　十│ 　 ││        　│        │        │        │　　　　　│里）　│ 　 │├─────┼────┼────┼────┼─────┼───┼──┤│  34．40  │  25．30│ 32．76 │  25．83│  17．72  │一等　│ 货 │├─────┼────┼────┼────┼─────┼───┤    ││  26．46  │  16．90│ 25．20 │  19．85│  11．82  │二等　│ 运 │├─────┼────┼────┼────┼─────┼───┤　  ││  18．90  │  11．25│ 18．00 │  14．18│   7．88  │三等　│ 价 │├─────┼────┼────┼────┼─────┼───┤ 　 ││   8．40  │   7．50│ 12．00 │   9．45│   5．25  │四等　│ 率 │├─────┼────┼────┼────┼─────┼───┤    ││   8．40  │   5．00│  8．00 │   6．30│   3．50  │五等　│ 　 │└─────┴────┴────┴────┴─────┴───┴──┘
    从上表看平津局运价最低，同蒲局最高，济南局次之。中原财办、西北解放区曾提出拟由中原运物资到天津，由石家庄运物资到同蒲，因感觉运价过高，又没有递远减，这些都说明了运价不统一，有高有低影响货物流通的情形，因之运价急需统一，这个任务由各局是解决不了的，必须由军委铁道部统一解决。
    乙、杂费方面——装卸费：平津局装一件行李十元，石家庄局装一件包裹要六两小米，行李四两小米，平津局整车货物每吨装费或卸费四十元，石家庄局十元零五角。其他如货物保管费，调车费，变更手续费等北方各局均不相同。
    （二）运价机构：
    甲、递远递减——东北铁路运到二○○○公里货运减百分之四十二点六，客运减百分之四十二，北方各局除石家庄局煤运订有特价外，其余都没有递远递减，以前胶济线尚未修好，济南用煤需由淄博矿区用牛车马车一点点的拉去，石家庄局要想把阳泉的煤运到济南去，就因为运价太高而不可能，所以这种办法是不妥当的，因为它不能鼓励物资远送。今后我们要鼓励出口，换回需要的物资器材，我们要把人民大众所需要的东西廉价远送，如果铁路在运价方面存有偏差，就不能正确的发展这种远途运送。
    乙、各等比率—东北铁路将货物分为十等，一等当十等货物三百六十倍。但北方各局现分五等，一等当五等的五倍，北方所沿用的还是国民党时期的老办法，这样的等差，运一二级品货物的人得便宜，所谓一二级品货物多是些消耗品、奢侈品、绸缎之类，这是有钱人运的，运劳苦大众生活必需品却相当的高，这样便违背了我们的政策，这对大地主、大资产阶级是有利的，国民党的铁路就是专为这些人服务的，我们却不然，为什么以前还采用国民党的办法呢？是因为以前还没有经验，没有很好研究，没有与东北沟通，现在与东北沟通了，我们就应当马上改过来，如果仍继续这样做，便不能适应新民主主义的经济政策，现在经过研究已经作了新的运价方案，这可说是运价的一个革命。
    （三）货物等级：
    东北现行货物分等系将货物分为十个等级，北方各局现分五等，东北的等级，在今天因为物价的变动，货物的负担已与以前有不同的变化，今天平津、济南、郑州、石家庄还沿用国民党的等级，这种分等法很不妥当，如他们把面粉、黄豆、小米、高粮米同放在四级品，以四月中旬北平运价和物价比较，运送五○○公里运费占面粉价格百分之四点七九，黄豆占百分之八点二四，小米占百分之六点二六，高粮米占百分之六点五六，煤：开滦煤运五○○公里运费占价格百分之二五点三六，门头沟煤占百分之五八点三三。依以上情形看它们负担不等，这是很不妥当的。因之货物等级需要重新制定，等级愈多愈较合理，社会主义国家苏联十月革命后分为十七个等级，而现在已经分为一一○个等级，我们目前的条件还不能分这末多等，这次会议决定我们暂分二十个等。
    我党二中全会肯定指出今后工作重心由乡村移到了城市，要变消费的城市为生产的城市，毛主席告诉我们要生产长一寸，今后恢复和发展生产，将要看作是一切工作的重点，我们在铁道运价政策方面要很好的贯彻这个方针，使工业农业很快的恢复和发展。
    （四）客货运规则及补则：
    北方各局还没有一套比较完整的规则，东北铁路经三年多实际工作和数次客货规则研究修改，今天已经有了一套规定。但我们应当承认东北铁路其所以有成绩，中长路是起了带头作用的，但我们还不能把东北的规则完全搬到北方或南方各铁路应用，还需要加以适当的修改使它变成并适合全国性的。
    这次会议期间，同志们日以继夜的努力不懈的工作，有两位同志病倒，对这种热心工作的精神，我谨在此致以慰问。经过大家分组研究讨论，对以上一些不合理不统一的现象都得到了解决，会议制定了全国统一的货物分等，货物技术装载吨数、统一了全国运价机构，订出东北客货运价率，北方与南方客货运价率，草拟出人民铁道运输暂行条例，提出制定全国客货运运输规则意见，并草拟出目前过渡期间全国客货运输规则，从以上看这次会议是有收获的，其次一个重大的收获是同志们对客货规章得到统一的一致的了解，而过去在东北或其他各局对于规章上同一问题往往有不相同的解释，在办理具体事情上就往往发生错误。
    人民解放战争将要很快的取得全国胜利，解放了的地区人民的生产力都得到解放，全国将要进行广大的经济建设工作，因此会有大量的物资、旅客需要铁路运输，我们办理客货运营业的同志将怎样迎接这个光荣任务呢？
    （一）在营业上同调度一样，要进一步推行负责制：铁路时常发生营业事故，过去在伪满时期一九三七年每百公里营业事故占百分之五十五点八三，一九四二年每百公里百分之三十七点三八，而我们东北铁路一九四八年每百公里为百分之二十二，一九四九年（一月至三月）每百公里为百分之十三，从这些数字看我们营业事故减少了许多，但不能说我们已经没有严重的缺点，譬如说东北铁路三月里由熊岳城发往扎乱屯地瓜，也因积压关系，至到达地全部损坏，铁路赔偿了一千三百万元。大屯站不办理整车货物，而榆树屯误办了，到长春站发觉，结果货车积压了十几天。军工部由海拉尔运甲种火药一车，货主问多少钱，我们站员以旧运价告诉军工部，待装好车按新运价一计算运费多出了很大，于是货主不发货了，并请求路局赔偿损失。平津局方面货票漏记的错误也不少，最近据公安局报告，有一人私运炸药一千斤，伪报普通货物托运，被我们公安机关查出，若我们在发站能很好的负责检查，这些违禁品是不能运的，这是应当提出来深加警惕的事！又最近唐山站发生一桩事情在火车开车前有一妇女背着一个麻袋要上车，经我们的公安警察拦阻，她丢下麻袋登车而去，事后检查麻袋里装的完全是雷管，我们要警惕这些破坏分子反动的阴谋。其他各局在营业上所发生的错误恐怕也不会少，我们只有在营业上推行负责制，才能减少或消灭这些事故。
    （二）办理负责运输：铁路负责输送对于货主有很大的便利，但今天因铁路设备关系，还不能完全办理负责输送。但我们要争取，北方南方各路局在一九四九年要全部做到行李、包裹、零担货物负责输送。东北铁路在一九四九年除现行行李、包裹、零担货物负责输送外，要做到部分整车货物负责输送，例如木材、枕木、煤等等。前铁道纵队托运抢修线路的枕木，因未实行负责输送而途中积压，影响工程进行，现在东北东兴公司为押运整车货物成立了押车队。若我们东北能实行部分的负责输送，国家开支便可减少许多，所以负责输送，对货主对国家都是很有益处的。
    （三）铁路与货主旅客关系：今天铁路是属于人民的，这和过去官僚资本家所办的铁路不同。人民铁路要办的好，主要靠广大职工爱护它，象每个人爱护自己的眼睛一样去受护它。因为今天我们是铁路的主人。另一方面也要依靠旅客、货主爱护铁路，铁路同旅客、货主搞好关系是件非常重要的事，因我们办理客货运营业的同志，要经常与旅客、货主接触来往。由于我们职工觉悟程度不同，个别职工对旅客货主服务的观点不强，有些地方互相关系还不正常，这里有些问题极待解决。
    （１）有些同志他不知道铁路存在的价值在于吸收大量的货主、旅客来利用铁路运输，不但不去全心全意为旅客、货主服务，反而错误的认为铁路是一种独占的企业，远距离的货物或旅客离了铁路不成，从这个错误的观点出发，就常常表现出傲慢的作风，态度冷淡，怕麻烦，货主、旅客违犯了规章只知征收罚款，不想法解决，敷衍了事，规章没有规定的也不反映或请示解决办法，譬如三月二日田昆冈同志由天津站托运人民券二百八十万元到东北购买药品，到天津站后，值班的站长鲍德永说不能托运，他并用书面答复说：铁路有命令托运货币超过二十公斤，要有当地党政机关及人民政府证明。田同志为取得证明到人民政府工商局军管会跑了多次，实际这个命令是国民党时规定的，我们人民铁路并没有这项规定，鲍德永不加分析的处理是多么害事。
    假如我们到一家私营代理店去看，将看到代理店的老板是多么殷勤的招待客商，虽然我们不需要学他们那种铺张虚伪，但他们对于客商的殷勤态度是值得我们学习的。
    还有我们站上个别办理客货运的同志只知道在家办公，不知道出去找货主，只有等货主走到我们门上来才给人家运，以上都是一些不良的现象。
    但也有些地方已经做出很好的成绩来，这是值得表扬的。哈尔滨局、滨江站货运同志主动的到市内找货主运货，增加路收东北币二亿元。肇东车站到市内招徕货商，结果多运三百车，山岔河站主动到市内找货商，结果多运出八十车，他们都得到了奖金。这种为人民服务的精神和工作方法，值得我们其他各局、各站学习，并且应当大大推广。
    （２）国民党、日本帝国主义统治中国时，他们的铁路与货主、旅客的关系是什么呢？只许铁路罚货主旅客，不许因铁路事由货主旅客发生损失罚铁路，今天我们是人民铁路，不仅有权利要求货主旅客遵守规章，而且有义务接受货主旅客的监督，例如因铁路事由货物交付迟延以致发生损失，快车超过国家批准的晚点时间，铁路也同样的要受罚款和退款的，这次我们起草的人民铁路暂行条例，和东北现行的客货中明确的规定了这一条，这是公允合理的，铁路应当成为遵守的模范，只有这样才能使我们的工作前进一步。
    （四）作风：我们办营业的同志，除了要具有顽强切实负责的作风外，还应当有廉洁的作风，过去在日本人统治铁路时代，社会上对办理客货运营业的人，有这样的一句话：“穷运转、富货物、不穷不富小荷物”，当然这里边也有廉洁的人，不过这些人当时没有被表扬出来，今天绝大多数的职工同志已经认明了这种说法是可耻的讽刺，但还不能说每一个职工都已有了这样的认识，还发生过贪污受贿盗窃等行为，今后为养成廉洁的作风，对于我们铁路职工，特别是对于新区的同志，要很好的进行教育，前几日我们财务局在天津一家染厂染布二百多匹卡其布被染坏，事后我们的同志提出来要他赔偿，他乘我们同志不注意的时候，往袋子里放上一块游泳表，但这块表买不了我们铁路职工，我们的同志没有接受，这样一方面教育了商家，一方面说明了今天人民铁路职工在作风上的不同。
    （五）学习：铁路事业在很快的发展，我们应当很好的学习毛主席告诉我们说：“要当人民的小学生，要向群众学习，向我们的朋友学习，而且要向我们的敌人学习。”每一个铁路从业员都不要满足于今天的技术，满足于今天的经验，先进的社会主义国家苏联有十五万公里的铁路，他们有一万万七千万人口，但他们的铁路从业员却已超过了三百万。我们有四万万七千万人口，铁路只有二万六千公里，铁路从业员只有三十万人，这是很不够的。我们全国工程师只有四千余人，假如在最近要增修一万五千公里的铁路，我们就得要四万的专家，我们要总结工作经验，要学习先进的社会主义国家苏联管理铁路的经验。国民党和美国、英国、日本，他们的铁路是为大资产阶级大地主服务，他们在营业上的一切办法也是符合于这些统治者的利益，而苏联与我们的铁路是属于人民的，我们在运用时当然要依据我们实际的情况，使之具体化。我们有些同志对于吸收先进国家苏联管理铁路的经验表示怀疑，甚至抵抗，这是很不对的。另一种是右的表现，是对资本主义国家和对国民党管理铁路营业上一些方法和运价方法，不加批判的相信接受，这也是不对的。更有一种表现是保守满足现状。这些都说明了我们同志们还需要很好的从政治上及业务上去加紧学习。今日是一个人民的时代，我们站在人民铁路运输岗位上的从业员同志们，不管从那里来，今天都应该变过来，努力学习，才能胜利的担当人民铁路的光荣的任务。
    我们的会议已经结束，以上我讲了这些，作为大家回去执行统一运价规章制度办法的参考。这次制定全国运价，主要是依据各地的物价指数，希望大家回去把五月份的物价指数整理出来报部，并希望大家回去能够召集干部传达大会的精神，仅在路局内部还不够，并向旅客、货商把我们新制定的运价规章办法进行有效的宣传。
