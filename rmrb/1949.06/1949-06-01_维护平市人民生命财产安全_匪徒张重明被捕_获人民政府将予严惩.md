  　Bandit Zhang Chongming Arrested; The People's Government Will Punish Him Severely
    [This newspaper reports] The bandit Zhang Chongming, who murdered revolutionary fighters and robbed the people of their property in Beiping, has been arrested. Bandit Zhang was the adjutant of the regimental headquarters of the Kuomintang pseudo-Suppression General Headquarters' Garrison Regiment. After the liberation of Beiping, he refused to accept peaceful reorganization. On February 1st, when marching out of the city, he shouted reactionary slogans. That evening, together with four bandit soldiers from the same regiment, he murdered one of our revolutionary fighters in the trenches near Luodaozhuang. After committing the crime, Bandit Zhang took a gun and entered the city on April 8th, attempting to rob, but was discovered by the Second Sub-bureau of the Public Security Bureau and sent to the Beiping Garrison Command, and then to the Dispersed Soldiers Reception Center. Bandit Zhang escaped for fear of punishment. On the evening of April 17th, the bandit robbed the Yufeng Cloth Shop, taking gold rings, a pocket watch, silver dollars, People's Bank notes, bicycles, and other items. On April 18th, police officers Gao Xi and others from our Public Security Bureau checked rooms at No. 12 Hongxing Grain Store and found stolen goods from Yufeng hidden in a bag belonging to a lodger named Liu Yumin, and sent him to the sub-bureau. After interrogation, the bandit admitted that he was Zhang Chongming, and confessed to the crimes of murdering soldiers and robbing civilians. Bandit Zhang committed crimes and robberies, continuing to be an enemy of the people and disrupting the revolutionary order. His crimes are obvious. Our People's Government has decided to punish him severely in order to maintain the safety of the lives and property of the people of Beiping. 　　　　　　　　(Ji)
