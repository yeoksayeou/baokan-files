Yang Shu, the Minister of Propaganda of the Central Committee of the New Democratic Youth League, first explained that the broad masses of children urgently demand the publication of children's publications. The Propaganda Department of the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League will publish children's magazines in the near future and will successively compile and print children's publications. Editors from "China Youth Press" and "Peiping Children's Society" explained that the main target audience of the children's magazine is children equivalent to the fourth and fifth grade of elementary school. The content will be comprehensive, and the guiding principle is to provide children with new knowledge, cultivate correct understanding and good habits in children, stimulate the development of children's intelligence, and improve children's writing ability. Attendees actively exchanged opinions on the content of the publications and children's culture, education, and children's work. Everyone believes that the content of children's publications should be diverse, including long stories and comic strips, children's works, science stories, historical legends, children's songs, children's dramas, children's games, etc., that suit children's interests. Special attention should be paid to stories and pictures, and the needs of children in both urban and rural areas should be taken into account. The printing should be relatively exquisite, and the lead print should be large to avoid damage to children's eyesight. The meeting also proposed to mobilize and organize workers in literature, science, music, art, education, and translation through this children's publication to care more about children and serve children more. It is necessary to cultivate children's writers in various fields and discover and cultivate various talents among children through this publication. The meeting also proposed that children's work should start from the actual needs of children, understand children's psychology and interests, pay attention to children's acceptance ability, and patiently and skillfully educate children to love the people, the new democratic country, and labor in a way that children like to see and hear. In addition, the problem of harmful "little people's books" (连环画) read by general children in cities was also discussed at the meeting.
