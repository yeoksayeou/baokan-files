　　Beiping Military Control Commission Order
　　Punishment of Military Representatives and Takeover Personnel
　　[This newspaper reports] The Beiping Military Control Commission of the People's Liberation Army has issued an order to the military representative and takeover team of the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant regarding the fire in the laboratory of the plant. The original order is as follows:
　　Since the liberation of Beiping, the Commission has entrusted Chen Lei with the responsibility of taking over the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant, with the aim of transforming the bureaucratic industrial organization under the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang into a new people's construction enterprise. However, after several months in office, the plant's management and inspection system has not been able to make the possible rectification, and it has shown paralysis and slackness in fire prevention, anti-espionage, and anti-theft measures. Later, in May, the plant was reorganized into the North China Iron and Steel Company, and Zhang Fang was appointed concurrently as the military representative of the plant to assist in the improvement of the plant's management and administrative work. In view of the fire incidents at the Liulihe Cement Plant and the Beiping Tram Company, the leading organs had issued two fire prevention circulars and instructions to the plant, but they did not attract the attention they deserved, resulting in a fire in the plant's laboratory on the night of May 25. The fire was caused by the poor design of the smelting furnace in the laboratory, the plant's inadequate fire-fighting equipment and lax inspection, and the failure of the workers on duty to take their watch seriously. Moreover, the fire brigade's patrol was weak and lacked preparation, which caused the fire to spread and caused huge losses to the factory. After careful inspection by all parties, the direct responsibility for the cause and responsibility of this fire lies with the laboratory and factory supervisors. However, Chen Lei, the person in charge of the takeover team sent by the Commission, Zhang Fang, the military representative, and Yu Shoukang, the director of the takeover team, originally had the task of supervising and leading the improvement, and their responsibility is even greater. If a little attention had been paid to it, this fire could have been avoided. The disaster caused by dereliction of duty and failure to implement the instructions of the higher authorities is a lack of due sense of responsibility for protecting the people's property, and appropriate punishment must be given to provide education. Chen Lei is the main person in charge of the Commission's takeover of the plant and bears a heavier responsibility. He is hereby dismissed from his post pending investigation. Representative Zhang Fang has only been in office for a short time, but he has neglected prevention beforehand and should also be seriously criticized. Yu Shoukang, director of the takeover team office, has not fulfilled his due responsibilities for the management and inspection of the factory and should be given a demerit. All should abide by and report on the implementation, and carry out in-depth review to strive for unity among all factory employees to improve management and increase production.

　　北平市军管会命令
  　处分军代表及接管人员
    【本报讯】人民解放军北平市军事管制委员会顷为石景山钢铁厂化验室失火事，对华北钢铁公司军事代表及接管组发出命令，原令如下：
    北平解放，本会接收工厂伊始，即委派陈雷负责接管石景山钢铁厂，期将国民党反动统治下官僚化的工业机构，变为人民的建设新事业。乃任职数月，该厂管理检查制度，尚未能作到可能的整顿，对于防火防特防盗，表现麻痹松懈。嗣于五月将该厂改建为华北钢铁公司，派张方兼任该厂军事代表，辅助进行对该厂管理行政工作的改进。鉴于琉璃河水泥厂及北平市电车公司失火事件，各领导机关对该厂曾有两次防火通报指示，竟未引起应有的注意，致于五月二十五日夜该厂化验室，竟因该化验室焖炉建筑设计不善，该厂防火设备不周与检查不严，值班工人未认真看守，而肇火灾，并因消防队巡逻不力，且乏准备，致火势蔓延，使工厂遭受巨大损失。经各方仔细检查，此次火灾发生原因与责任，化验室及工厂主管人固应负直接责任，而本会派去接管组负责人陈雷、军事代表张方、接管组于寿康原负监督与领导改进任务，责任尤为重大。平时如稍加注意，则此次火灾即可能避免，因怠忽职守及执行上级指示不力所发生之灾害，即是对保护人民财产缺乏应有的责任心，必须予以适当处分，以资教育。陈雷为本会接管该厂之主要负责人，责任较重，着即撤职听候查办。代表张方到职不久，但事前疏于防范，亦应予以严重批评。接管组办公室主任于寿康，对工厂管理检查未尽到应有责任，应予记过处分。统仰遵照办理具报，并开展深入的检讨，为团结全厂职工改善管理、提高生产而努力。
