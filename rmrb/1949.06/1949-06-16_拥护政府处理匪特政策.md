　　Endorsing the Government's Policy on Handling Bandits and Spies
    The Military Law Department of the Beiping Military Control Commission, accepting the just demands of the people of Beiping, has legally sentenced the incorrigible Kuomintang bandits and spies Li Junbo, Ye Zhimao, Li Keqin, Cheng Zhuqing, and Xin Wei, who continued to endanger the people, to death, and executed them by firing squad yesterday afternoon.
    Before the liberation of Beiping, these bandits had repeatedly harmed the people, and their crimes were notorious. After the liberation of Beiping, they secretly infiltrated and engaged in activities, even falsely using the names of the Beiping Municipal People's Government Public Security Bureau, the Ji-Re-Cha Urban Work Department, etc., to gather bandits, spies, scattered soldiers, and hooligans, stealing firearms everywhere, robbing people's property, killing revolutionary patriots, spreading rumors, and endangering the people. All these anti-people and brutal crimes are truly unforgivable.
    Our People's Government has always adhered to a lenient policy, and for past criminals, except for those who are guilty of heinous crimes and cannot be reformed, we always give them the opportunity to repent, confess their crimes to the people, and start anew—as long as there is a glimmer of hope for their reform. Since the People's Liberation Army entered the city, it has conducted the registration of special agents, demonstrating our People's Government's policy on handling special agents. However, Li and other bandits brazenly refused to repent and continued to be enemies of the people, which is truly heinous. In order to protect the lives and property of the people, and accepting the just demands of the broad masses of the people, our People's Government cannot but impose the death penalty on these incorrigible and ferocious elements in order to uphold justice and appease the people. The remaining accomplices are sentenced to fixed-term imprisonment or released after education, implementing a lenient policy towards them and giving them a path to self-renewal.
    The Kuomintang reactionaries, as they are about to die, are still attempting secret conspiracies, disrupting revolutionary order, and endangering the lives and property of the people. We hope that all the people of Beiping will be more vigilant, strengthen defense work, and assist the People's Government in striving to build an orderly new people's city.

### 拥护政府处理匪特政策

　　拥护政府处理匪特政策
    北平市军管会军法处接受平市人民正义要求，依法判处怙恶不悛、继续危害人民的国民党匪特李峻波、叶志茂、李克勤、程祝青、辛维等五人死刑，并在昨日下午执行枪决。
    李匪等在北平解放前，曾屡次残害人民，罪恶昭彰；北平解放后，复潜入秘密活动，竟假借北平市人民政府公安局、冀热察城工部等名义，纠合匪特、散兵游勇以及流氓地痞，到处窃取枪支，抢劫人民财产，杀害革命志士，散布谣言，危害人民，凡此种种反人民的残暴罪行，实不容宽恕。
    我人民政府一向本着宽大政策，对于以往的罪恶分子，除罪大恶极不可改造者外，总给予以痛改前非，向人民低头认罪，重新做人的机会——只要他们有一线改造的希望。人民解放军入城以来，即举行特务登记，昭示我人民政府处理特务的政策。然而李匪等悍然不知悔悟，继续与人民为敌，实属罪大恶极。我人民政府为了保护人民生命财产，并接受广大人民的正义要求，对于这类怙恶不悛的凶恶分子，决不能不处以极刑，以彰正义，而平人心。对于其余胁从分子，分别处以有期徒刑，或教育释放，对之实行宽大政策，给以自新之路。
    国民党反动派在将要死亡的时候，仍图作秘密阴谋活动，破坏革命秩序，危害人民生命财产。我们希望全北平市人民更要提高警觉，加强防卫工作，协助人民政府，共为建立有秩序的新的人民城市而奋斗。
