Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 31st. After the complete liberation of Shanghai, the heads of various democratic parties in Shanghai, including Zhang Lan, Luo Longji, Shi Liang, Guo Chuntao, Yang Hu, Chen Mingshu, Min Ganghou, Feng Yidai, Lian Ruiqi, Wang Jiyi, Yang Weiyu, and Hu Juewen, jointly issued the following statement on the 28th:

　　The greatest and most glorious people's revolution in Chinese history has achieved a complete victory nationwide. After crossing the Yangtze River, the People's Liberation Army quickly advanced to Shanghai, the largest industrial and commercial city in the Far East, which has now been liberated. Shanghai has begun a new chapter in its history, and the six million people of Shanghai have a new light and a new life. Standing on the position of the various democratic parties, we would like to express our warm welcome to the respectable and beloved People's Liberation Army. At the same time, we express our sincere congratulations to the Chinese Communist Party, which leads this people's revolution, and to Mr. Mao Zedong, the leader of the Chinese Communist Party.

　　Shanghai is one of the world's industrial and commercial centers, so we believe that the liberation of Shanghai today will surely attract the special attention of people all over the world. We would like to take this opportunity to call on the governments and people of all countries in the world to truly recognize the true meaning of this Chinese revolution. To put it bluntly, this is the great New Democratic Revolution carried out by the Chinese people. The goal of this revolution is to overthrow feudal autocracy internally and oppose imperialist aggression externally. There is no doubt that this is a people's revolution led by the Chinese Communist Party and jointly participated in by the various democratic parties in China. This is a revolution for the complete liberation of the entire Chinese people and the entire nation. We must earnestly follow the New Democracy advocated by Mr. Mao Zedong. This revolution will rapidly establish the democratic power of the Chinese people. To realize a people's democratic united government based on workers and peasants, to strive for the true freedom and true equality of the people, and to achieve the goal of true democracy and true peace in China. The nature of this revolution must not be misunderstood, and the significance of this revolution must not be distorted.

　　Shanghai is now liberated, and every one of the six million Chinese and foreign citizens of Shanghai has the experience of personally experiencing this great revolution. From this experience, we would like to put forward the following two points: First, the remaining forces represented by Chiang Kai-shek and his reactionary clique have failed to the end. The Shanghai battle clearly proves that this remaining force has completely collapsed and disintegrated. Therefore, we would like to seriously warn the remaining soldiers, special agents, etc. abandoned by Chiang Kai-shek in Shanghai and other regions, do not be obsessed with your own ideas, and do not be slaves and running dogs of individuals again, and do not continue to be enemies of the people. You should immediately realize the truth, abandon the darkness and turn to the light, and redeem your sins in order to avoid meaningless destruction. Second, the People's Liberation Army victoriously entered Shanghai, which shows that the Chinese people's revolution has expanded from the countryside to the largest industrial and commercial city in China according to the established plan. The goal of the people's revolution is not only to avoid meaningless destruction, but also to carry out construction in a step-by-step and planned manner. The malicious propaganda spread by the reactionary puppet government in the past, slandering the People's Liberation Army for indiscriminately confiscating private property everywhere and arbitrarily destroying production, etc., has now proved that this is just a big lie to deceive the people. Everyone has already seen that the People's Liberation Army loves the people. The purpose of the people's revolution is to protect and increase the interests of the people. Now that the power of the people's revolution has reached Shanghai, the future effort is to seek construction from stability in Shanghai.

　　We want to transform and build Shanghai, which is dominated by imperialism and abnormally developed, into a modern industrial and commercial democratic city. We must cherish this industrial and commercial foundation of Shanghai to build a modern industrialized New China; therefore, Shanghai citizens should thoroughly understand that everyone has the responsibility to do their best to stabilize and protect Shanghai. In this revolutionary process, Shanghai industrialists and businessmen, in the negative aspect, should stick to their posts and stick to their professions to maintain the order of the city; in the positive aspect, they should all do their best, exert their talents, and do their best sincerely to accelerate the development of the industrial and commercial construction of the entire Shanghai and the entire country, so that the modernization of Chinese industry and commerce can be quickly successful.

　　Shanghai is now liberated, and we firmly believe that the glorious date of the liberation of Shanghai is the time when the remaining forces of Chiang Kai-shek and his bandit gang are finally buried. After Chiang Kai-shek's complete military failure and resignation from the puppet presidency, he still dreamed of using Shanghai's manpower and material resources for a last-ditch struggle, in an attempt to revive Chinese fascism. He used all the most cruel, most severe, most ferocious, and most despicable means in the world to kill and slaughter the people in order to support his remaining life. Surprise inspections, collective arrests, joint guarantees, and merciless killings, all kinds of inhumane and anti-human methods of killing people, all the methods used by the despotic emperors and tyrannical rulers of the dark ages in Chinese history to slaughter the people, have been fully implemented by the Chiang gang in the final struggle in Shanghai. This kind of crazy reversal of history fully proves that the Chiang gang is at the end of its rope. This kind of behavior has further aroused the anger of the people and accelerated the demise of the reactionaries. Therefore, we frankly advise the pseudo-political organizations and military forces of all provinces and cities in southern China that have not yet been liberated to thoroughly realize that any resistance to the people's revolution in the future is useless, and any stubborn resistance in the future is just a stupid act. All the atrocities of slaughtering and destroying the people are meaningless and unnecessary damage to the people; for the Chiang bandits' only remaining forces themselves, it is not only digging their own graves in the present, but also a sin that will never be forgiven. As the situation has evolved to today, you have completely lost the support of the people and your military force has completely collapsed. Any conspiracy to prolong your lives in the future, such as the so-called self-protection in the southeast, the so-called joint defense in the southwest, and even the attempt to use the isolated island of Taiwan as a nest for the exiled puppet government, are all just complete fantasies. The People's Liberation Army's iron hooves will quickly destroy these fantasies. You should know that the wishes of the people cannot be violated, the will of the people cannot be resisted, and the success of the people's revolution cannot be delayed at all. You should have the courage to admit your failure, and you should have the courage to surrender to the Chinese people. You should seize this last opportunity to redeem your sins in order to help our country quickly complete the most glorious and greatest people's revolution in Chinese history.

　　Finally, we would like to make a solemn statement to the people of the world. The Chinese people's revolution is the liberation and rejuvenation of the entire Chinese people and the entire nation. At the same time, this is also our effort for world peace and democracy. The Chinese people are willing to cooperate friendly with any country and any people who support peace. Anyone who respects China's sovereignty and the interests of the people, abides by Chinese laws, and conducts trade with China on the principle of equality and mutual benefit, the Chinese people are willing to cooperate with them and seek prosperity together. If the government or party of any country still hopes to support the remaining reactionary forces in China in order to achieve their imperialist conspiracy of aggression, thereby harming the common interests of the Chinese people, the Chinese people will regard them as public enemies.

　　Zhang Lan, Luo Longji, Shi Liang, Guo Qingtao, Yang Hu, Chen Mingshu, Min Ganghou, Feng Yidai, Lian Ruiqi, Wang Jiyi, Yang Weiyu, Hu Juewen.
　　May 28th

　　上海完全解放后
  　张澜等发表声明
    【新华社上海卅一日电】上海全部解放后，各民主党派在上海的负责人张澜、罗隆基、史良、郭春涛、杨虎、陈铭枢、闵刚侯、冯亦代、连瑞琦、王寄一、杨卫玉、胡厥文等十二人于二十八日联名发表声明如下：
    中国历史上最伟大、最光荣的人民革命已经取得全国范围的彻底胜利。人民解放军在横渡长江之后，很快进展到了上海，这个远东最大的工商业都市已经解放了。上海开始了一页新的历史，上海六百万人民有了新的光明与新的生命。我们站在各民主党派的立场，谨先向可敬可爱的人民解放军表示热烈的欢迎，同时，我们向领导这个人民革命的中国共产党及中国共产党的领袖毛泽东先生表示热诚的庆贺。
    上海是全世界工商业重心之一，因此我们相信今天上海的解放，必定引起了全世界人士的特殊注意。我们愿就这个机会唤起全世界各国的政府及人民，切实认识这次中国革命的真正意义。开宗明义的说，这是中国人民所进行的伟大的新民主主义的革命。这个革命的目标，对内是推翻封建独裁，对外反对帝国主义侵略。绝无疑义，这是中国共产党所领导而中国各民主党派所共同参加的人民革命，这是中国全体人民整个民族彻底翻身彻底解放的革命。我们要切实遵行毛泽东先生所倡导的新民主主义。这次革命将迅速建立中国人民的民主政权。要实现以工农为基础的人民民主的联合政府，以争取人民的真自由真平等，以达到中国真民主真和平的目的。这种革命的性质不容误会，这种革命的意义不许曲解。
    上海如今已经解放了，上海六百万中外市民每个人都有亲身经历这个伟大革命的经验。从这个经验中，我们愿意提出下面这两点意见：第一、蒋介石及其反动集团所代表的残余力量失败到了尽头，上海战事确切证明这种残余力量已经完全崩溃瓦解了。因此我们愿严重警告被蒋介石抛弃在上海及其他地区的残余军人、特工人员等等，你们不要执迷不悟，再做个人的奴才走狗，再继续做人民的敌人，你们应立即大澈大悟，弃暗投明，将功赎罪，以避免本身无意义的毁灭。第二、人民解放军胜利进入上海，这说明中国人民革命已按预定计划，从农村扩展到了中国最大的工商业都市。人民革命的目标不止不做无意义的破坏，而且要做有步骤有计划的建设。过去反动伪政府所散布的恶意宣传，污蔑人民解放军到处无端没收私产，到处任意破坏生产等等，而今证明了这只是欺骗人民的大谎，大家已经看到了人民解放军是爱护人民的。人民革命的目的是保障并增加人民的利益，人民革命的力量既已到了上海，今后的努力是要把上海从安定中谋建设。
    我们要把一个帝国主义支配、畸形发展的上海、改造建立成为现代化工商业的民主的都市。我们更要爱惜上海这一点工商业的基础，来建设现代工业化的新中国；因此，上海市民应彻底认识，我们人人有尽自己的力量来安定与保障上海的责任。在这个革命过程中，上海工商业人士，在消极方面，应各守岗位，各守本业，以维持本市的秩序；在积极方面，且应人人尽其才智，竭其真诚，以加速整个上海、整个国家的工商业的建设事业的发展，使中国工商业的现代化得以迅速成功。
    上海如今已经解放了，我们坚决相信上海解放的光荣日期是蒋介石及其匪帮集团残余力量最后埋葬的时候。蒋介石全盘军事失败并辞去伪总统职位后，依然梦想利用上海人力物力为困兽之斗，以作中国法西斯起死回生的企图。他用尽人世间最残忍、最酷刻、最凶暴、最卑鄙下贱的一切手段，杀戮屠害人民，以支持他的残余生命。突击检查，集体逮捕，连保连坐，格杀勿论，种种不人道反人道的杀人办法，凡中国历史上黑暗时代专制帝王无道暴君所用的一切屠害人民的方法，蒋帮在上海最后挣扎的时期，均已全盘实行了。这种疯狂的倒行逆施，充分证明蒋帮的日暮途穷。这类行为更激起了人民的愤怒，加速了反动者的灭亡。因此，我们很坦白的劝告中国南部一切尚未解放的各省市的伪政治组织及军事力量，应彻底觉悟，今后对人民革命的任何抵抗是毫无效用的，今后任何负隅顽抗只是愚蠢的行为。一切屠杀摧残人民的暴行，这在人民方面来说，是毫无意义的，不必要的损害；这在蒋匪仅有的残余力量本身来说，不止是当前的自掘坟墓，并且是千古不赦的罪孽。时局演变到了今天，你们已经民心丧失干净，武力溃败无余，今后任何苟延残喘的阴谋计划，例如所谓东南自保，所谓西南联防，甚至企图以台湾孤岛作为流亡伪政府的巢窟，都不过是全盘的幻想。人民解放军铁骑所至，你们这些幻想都将迅速陷于破灭。你们应该知道，人民的愿望是不可违背的，人民的意志是不可抵抗的，人民革命的成功是绝对无法延缓的。你们应该有勇气承认你们的失败，你们更应该有胆量来向中国人民投降。你们应该争取这个最后的时机，将功赎罪，以利我国迅速完成中国历史上最光荣、最伟大的人民革命。
    最后我们愿向全世界的人士做一个严正的声明。中国人民的革命乃中国全体人民整个民族的解放与复兴，同时，这也是我们为全世界和平民主的努力。中国人民愿与世界任何国家，任保拥护和平的人民亲善合作。凡尊重中国主权及人民利益，遵守中国法律，在平等互惠之原则上，中国人民愿意与之贸易，共图繁荣。若有任何国家的政府或党派，仍然冀图支持中国的残余反动力量以遂其帝国主义者的侵略阴谋，因而损害中国人民之共同利益者，中国人民必视之为公敌。
