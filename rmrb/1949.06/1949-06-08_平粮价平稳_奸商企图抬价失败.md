　　【Ping City News】Yesterday, the opening price of food grains in Ping City was firm, and the closing price was stable. Except for corn, millet, red sorghum, sorghum rice, and corn flour, which remained the same, other grains rose slightly, with flour showing the largest increase. Some flour merchants in the city were attempting to manipulate flour prices. At the opening, many flour mills did not quote prices but instead purchased wheat, thus creating an upward trend. The Trade Company, aware of this, lowered the price of standard flour from 3,700 yuan to 3,600 yuan, dealing a severe blow to speculative merchants, and the price turned from firm to stable. Today, the company sold more than a thousand bags of various types of standard flour and more than 300,000 catties of various coarse and refined grains.

　　The yarn market saw little actual sales due to the absence of out-of-town merchants, so prices remained stable from opening to closing. The cloth market saw very few transactions and closed after 2 p.m. due to rain.

　　平粮价平稳　奸商企图抬价失败
    【平市讯】昨日食粮开盘价硬，收盘平稳。除玉米、小米、红粮、高粮米、玉米面等持平外，其他均微升，其中以面粉上升较多。本市面商颇有操纵面粉情况，于开盘时各粉厂多不开价，而先购小麦，故造成上升趋势。贸易公司有见于此，于是通粉牌价由三七○○元落至三六○○元，予投机商人以严重打击，价遂由硬转平。公司今日共售各种通粉千袋以上，各种粗细粮三十余万斤。
    纱市因无外地商贩购买，实销不多，故开盘至收盘价格持平。布市成交甚少，至午后二时以后因雨收市。
