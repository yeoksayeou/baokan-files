　　Overseas Chinese Democratic Representative Mr. Chen Jiageng said:
    Overseas Chinese have long lived a painful, slave-like existence under the colonial governments of imperialists, urgently awaiting the motherland's government to rescue them. At the same time, from decades of personal experience, especially in recent years, they have come to recognize that the Kuomintang reactionary government not only cannot protect the safety of their lives and property, but on the contrary, sends out large numbers of special agents who collude with local governments to oppress Overseas Chinese and massacre patriotic elements among them. Therefore, from the very beginning of the People's Liberation War in the motherland, Overseas Chinese have hoped that the people of the motherland would achieve final victory in this war, establish their own people's government, and send consuls who represent the interests of the people to guarantee the safety of the lives and property of Overseas Chinese. Now, this hope is about to be fully realized. The current convening of the new Political Consultative Conference is the result of the people of the motherland achieving final victory. After the convening of the new Political Consultative Conference, a united government will soon be established, and powerful consuls will be sent to guarantee the safety of the lives and property of Overseas Chinese.
    After the new Political Consultative Conference or the establishment of a united government, Overseas Chinese will definitely recall an inspection delegation to examine the economic construction situation of the motherland, in order to understand what responsibilities Overseas Chinese should fulfill in the economic construction of the motherland and participate in the economic construction of the motherland.

　　海外华侨民主人士代表陈嘉庚先生说：
    海外华侨久已在帝国主义的殖民地政府下，过着奴隶式的痛苦的生活，急待着祖国政府来解救自己，同时，又从几十年来的亲身经历中，尤其近几年来，认识了国民党反动政府，不但不能保护自己生命、财产的安全，相反的，派出大批特务，勾结当地政府，欺压华侨，残杀华侨中的爱国分子，所以在祖国人民解放战争一开始，海外华侨就希望着祖国人民在这次战争中取得最后胜利，成立人民自己的政府，派出代表人民利益的领事，保障海外华侨的生命、财产的安全。现在，这个希望即将完全实现，这一次召开的新的政治协商会议，就是祖国人民取得了最后胜利的成果。召开新政协后，即将成立联合的政府，派出有力的领事，保障海外华侨的生命、财产的安全。
    海外华侨，一定会在新政协或成立联合政府后，召回考察团，考察祖国的经济建设状况，以理解海外华侨在祖国经济建设中，要求与国该尽些什么责任，参加祖国的经济建设。
