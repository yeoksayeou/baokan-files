Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 1st – Moscow dispatch: Children's summer camps will soon open throughout the Soviet Union, and cities are making preparations. The vast majority of school-age children over the age of seven will spend their summer vacations in the countryside. Three-quarters of the summer camp expenses are subsidized by trade unions, and the children's parents only need to bear one-quarter of the expenses. Children of soldiers who sacrificed and were wounded in the Patriotic War, as well as children of laboring people with large families, are completely free. The government has also allocated a large sum of money to improve children's health this summer.

　　苏联全国各地筹办儿童夏令营
    【新华社北平一日电】莫斯科讯：苏联全国各地就要开办儿童夏令营，各城市都正在进行准备工作。最大多数的七岁以上的学龄儿童，都将到乡间度过他们的暑假。夏令营费用的四分之三由职工会津贴，孩子们的父母只要负担四分之一的费用。在爱国战争中牺牲和受伤的兵士们的儿童，以及家庭人口多的劳动人民的儿童，则完全免费。政府也拨出大笔款项，用来在今年夏季增进儿童们的健康。
