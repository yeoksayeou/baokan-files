    Coke Oven Gas Used to Boil Stinking Oil
    Saves 13 Tons of Coal Monthly
    [Shijiazhuang Dispatch] The coke oven plant's stinking oil workshop has successfully used coke oven gas to boil stinking oil, saving 13 tons of coal monthly. Coke oven gas is a gas produced during coking, and a portion was previously released without being utilized. More than a decade ago, German engineers had wanted to use coke oven gas to boil stinking oil, but they considered it too dangerous. If, for example, the powerhouse's windmill stopped and the gas went out, and the person watching the fire didn't notice, the gas would come on again and mix with the air inside the furnace. If it reached a certain level, it would explode, potentially shattering the pot and causing extreme danger. The German engineers didn't trust the fire-watchers, so they never dared to do it this way. But now, the workers are the masters of the factory. They pay extremely close attention: if the gas goes out, they immediately close the gas valve. When the gas comes on again, they first light a fire at the mouth of the gas pipe before opening the gas valve, so there is no danger. Engineer Dai at the plant recognized this, and Section Chief Dou of the engineering section and the workers in the stinking oil workshop were also confident that it could be done without problems. The equipment has now been installed, and two pots of stinking oil have been boiled using coke oven gas. The results are very good, with more even heating and more consistent oil production than using coal fire. The plant originally boiled 20 pots of oil per month. Calculating a minimum coal consumption of 650 kilograms per pot, this will save 13 tons of coal per month.

    炼焦厂用瓦斯熬臭油
    每月可节省煤十三吨
    【石家庄电】炼焦厂臭油房试用瓦斯熬臭油成功。每月可省煤十三吨。瓦斯是炼焦时产生的气体，过去有一部分不能利用而放掉。十几年前德国工程师就曾想利用瓦斯熬臭油，但因危险，即假如动力房的风车一停，瓦斯灭了，看烧的人不知道，瓦斯再一来，和炉内空气混和，到某种程度就会爆炸，可能把锅炸破，出极大的危险。德国工程师是不相信看火工人的，所以一直没有敢这样办。但现在工人是工厂的主人了，他们极负责地注意：瓦斯一灭便赶紧将瓦斯门关住；瓦斯再来时，先点着火放在瓦斯管口上，再开瓦斯门，就不会有危险。该厂戴工程师认识了这一点，工程科窦科长和臭油房的工人也确信能做到，不会出毛病。现已装好，用瓦斯熬了两锅臭油，成效很好，比煤火更匀，来油更正常。该厂原在每月熬油二十锅，每锅按最少的用煤六百五十公斤计算，每月即可省十三吨煤。
