　　Huada Saves Over 50,000 Jin of Millet; North China People's Government Sends Letter of Commendation
    [This newspaper dispatch] The 15,000 faculty, staff, and students of North China University have responded to the Party and government's call for frugality with practical actions. Since May, each person has saved two liang of millet from their daily meals, saving over 50,000 jin of millet in one month. In other areas, such as purchasing, medicine, electricity, water, office supplies, and staff organization, rigorous streamlining has also achieved significant results. Comrades at the Zhengding branch directly handed over their savings to the local government to aid in disaster relief (as reported previously). The North China People's Government sent a letter of commendation to President Wu and Vice Presidents Fan and Cheng on June 2nd. The letter stated: "The more than 4,000 staff and students of the Zhengding Branch of North China University have launched a donation campaign, saving grain to help the disaster-stricken people of Zhengding. Various units in Tianjin and Beiping have also allocated surplus grain for disaster relief. This spirit of caring for the suffering of the masses and sharing weal and woe with them should be commended. In addition to calling on personnel in all government organs to practice economy based on their actual conditions, we hope that you will convey our regards to all teachers, students, and staff!"

    【本报讯】华北大学全体教职学员一万五千人，用实际行动响应了党和政府节约的号召。自五月份起每人每日从伙食内节约二两小米，一个月就节约了小米五万多斤，其他在采买、医药、用电、用水、办公用品以及工作人员的编制上，厉行精简，均获不小成绩。正定分校的同志们，将节约所得直接交与当地政府，救济灾荒（已志前报）。华北人民政府特于六月二日致函吴、范、成正副校长奖励。文称：华北大学正定分校全体工作人员及同学四千余人，发起捐助运动，节约粮食，救济正定灾民。平津各单位亦拨节余粮救灾，这种关心群众疾苦与群众共甘苦的精神，应予表扬，除号召各机关人员按照实际情况进行节约外，希对全体师生及工作人员致意为荷！
