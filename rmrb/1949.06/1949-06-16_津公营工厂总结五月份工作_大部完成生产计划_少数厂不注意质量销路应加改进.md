Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, 14th: According to a survey at the end of May, most of Tianjin's public factories have completed their May production plans, and some have even exceeded them. The Tianjin Steel Plant's open-hearth furnace produced more than 20 heats after being opened on May 24, with each heat producing about 22 tons of steel. In May, the various China Textile factories produced 15,980 bales of yarn and 381,086 bolts of cloth, exceeding the original plan by 3.4% for yarn and 4% for cloth. Compared with April's output, yarn increased by 17.4% and cloth by 12%. The monthly output also exceeded the total output of the factory's normal production period in June last year (before liberation) (excluding the Seventh Factory), with yarn exceeding by nearly 1% and cloth by 1.4%. The Second Steel Fittings Factory of the Ministry of Railways produced 470,000 railroad spikes and 1,056 picks, exceeding the production plan of 450,000 railroad spikes and 1,000 picks. The waterworks repair team repaired five wind pumps, eight electric motors, and painted a million-gallon reservoir, exceeding the original plan by 100%. The China Vegetable Oil Factory produced 1,600 boxes of soap in May, exceeding the plan by 60%. The machine pressing group originally planned to press an average of 5 tons of cottonseed per day, but the actual average was 6 tons per day. In addition to completing the original production plan, the Signals Factory directly under the Ministry of Railways also produced 18 additional signal lights, built an additional coke oven, installed an electric welding machine, and manufactured 120 meters of large iron pipes for bridge repairs on the Huai River; total output exceeded April's by 22% and exceeded the Kuomintang's rule by 56%. The South Factory of the Electrical Equipment Factory originally planned to manufacture 50,000 light bulbs, but exceeded this by more than 16,400, and repaired more than 1,000 mine lamps. Other factories, such as the West Factory and North Factory of the Electric Appliance Factory, the Tianjin Clothing Factory, the Automobile Manufacturing and Distribution Factory, and the Dongya Tobacco Factory, also completed or exceeded their plans.

　　The quality of products in May also improved compared to April. For example, of the 120,000 sets of shirts and pants and 60,000 sets of single military uniforms made by the Tianjin Clothing Factory, only one-tenth were substandard and had to be reworked, compared to 49% in April. The percentage of unqualified pistons produced by the Automobile Manufacturing and Distribution Factory was 5.5%, a decrease of 2.5% compared to April. Significant achievements have also been made in improving technology and saving raw materials. The Dongya Tobacco Factory used to use American tobacco leaves, but now it uses only domestic tobacco leaves, which is of excellent quality and sells better than both American and Chinese tobacco. Workers in the power department of the Second China Textile Factory developed a substitute for belt oil, which is effective and 75% cheaper than the market price. Employees of the factory's cloth factory used waste materials to successfully manufacture a leather machine and a riveting machine, which were used to repair waste leather hammers, reducing the use of new leather hammers by more than 1,000 per month, saving over 9 million People's Yuan. After workers in the boiler room of the China Vegetable Oil Factory successfully burned cotton seed hulls mixed with coal, they saved more than 150 tons of coal for the entire month.

　　However, some factories did not complete their plans in May, and some factories did not pay attention to quality and sales, thus losing the true meaning of increasing production. The reason is that the production plans of some factories were not practical, and they did not make precise calculations based on raw material supply, machinery and equipment, manpower, and sales when formulating the plans. For example, the insufficient supply of aluminum, the main raw material for the Automobile Manufacturing and Distribution Factory, prevented the completion of the planned number of piston blanks. The Tianjin Pulp and Paper Company's First Factory produced more 80-pound bond paper and less 50-pound bond paper. Although the total output of various papers exceeded the plan, the 80-pound bond paper was difficult to sell. Some factories also had accidents in which tools were damaged in order to increase production. When the Tianjin Enterprise Company's Chemical Factory evaporated hydrochloric acid and salt solutions, the explosion of 42 magnetic steam pipes at the bottom of the tank occurred because the maximum efficiency of the evaporation tank and machine was exceeded. The responsible spirit and inspection system of various departments in some factories have not been well implemented, resulting in a lack of precautions and incidents of finished products being burned.

　　The failure to earnestly mobilize and organize the enthusiasm of workers is also an important reason why some factories have not completed their production plans. When formulating production plans, some factories did not mobilize workers to conduct in-depth discussions, so that the plans did not become the conscious action goals of the majority of workers. When Tianjin's prices fluctuated in the first half of May, individual factory workers had doubts about the real value of wages, but the factory failed to patiently explain and properly resolve the issue. Some factories also failed to conduct in-depth ideological education for workers when they began to implement streamlining. These more or less affected the production mood of the workers.

　　In order to welcome the arrival of the "July 1st" anniversary of the founding of the Communist Party of China, the public factories in Tianjin have successively formulated production plans for June after reviewing the production achievements and shortcomings in May in order to create greater production achievements.

　　津公营工厂总结五月份工作
  　大部完成生产计划
    少数厂不注意质量销路应加改进
    【新华社天津十四日电】津市各公营工厂的五月份生产计划，据五月底调查，已大部完成，并有部分超过。天津炼钢厂马丁炉于五月二十四日开炉后，至月底共出二十余炉，每炉产钢二十二吨左右。中纺各厂五月份共产纱一五、九八○件、产布三八一、○八六匹，与原计划相较，纱超过百分之三点四，布超过百分之四；与四月份产量相较，纱增加百分之一七·四，布增加百分之一二。上月产量并已超过了去年（解放前）六月份该厂正常生产时期的总产量（七厂在外），计纱超过近百分之一，布超过百分之一·四。铁道部钢铁配件二厂制出道钉四十七万个，洋镐一千零五十六个，超过了道钉四十五万个，洋镐一千个的生产计划。自来水厂修理班共修理风泵五座、电动机八座，及油漆百万加仑水库一个，超出原计划百分之百。中国植物油料厂五月份制出肥皂一千六百箱，超出计划百分之六十；机榨组原计划平均日榨棉籽五吨，结果平均日榨六吨。铁道部直辖号志厂除完成原定生产计划外，并额外增产号志灯十八个，增筑炼焦炭窑一座，配装电焊机一台，制造淮河修桥用的大铁管一百二十米；总产量超过四月份的百分之二十二，超过国民党统治时的百分之五十六。电工器材厂南厂原计划制造灯泡五万个，结果超过一万六千四百余个，并修好矿灯千余个；其他如电器厂的西厂、北厂及天津被服厂，汽车制配厂，东亚烟草厂等，也都完成或超过了计划。
    五月份的产品质量比四月份也有提高。如天津被服厂所制的十二万套衬衫裤和六万套单军装中，不合规格而重行修改的只占十分之一，而四月份占百分之四十九。汽车制配厂生产的活塞，不合格的占百分之五·五，比四月份减少了百分之二·五。关于改进技术和节省原料，也有相当成绩。东亚烟草厂过去曾用美国烟叶，现在完全改用国产烟叶，质量极好，销路较美烟、中烟均好。中纺二厂原动部工人配制了一种皮带油代用品，效能良好，且较市价低百分之七十五。该厂布厂职工利用废料制成功皮机及压铆机各一部，用以修制废皮榔头，使全月使用的新皮榔头少用千余个，节省人民券达九十多万元。中国植物油料厂锅炉房工人以棉籽皮掺煤烧炉成功后，全月省煤一百五十余吨。
    但五月份中也有少数厂没有完成计划，有些厂则不注意质量与销路，因而失却了增产的真正意义。其原因是有些厂的生产计划不切合实际，在拟定计划时没有根据原料供应，机器设备与人力、销路等情况作精密计算。如汽车制配厂因主要原料的铝供应不充分，使活塞铸坯的数量没有完成计划。天津纸浆造纸公司第一厂多造八十磅模造纸，少造五十磅模造纸，虽各种纸总产量超过计划，但八十磅模造纸却不好推销。有些厂中还发生为增产而损害工具的事故。津市企业公司化学厂蒸发盐酸、盐溶液时，因为超过了蒸发罐和机器的最大效能，使罐底四十二根磁铁汽管发生爆炸。有些厂的各部门负责精神与检查制度也没有很好贯彻，致有疏于防范，成品被烧的事件发生。
    没有认真发动与组织职工的积极性，也是某些厂没有完成生产计划的重要原因之一。有些厂在制定生产计划时，没有发动职工进行深入讨论，因而使计划没有变成广大职工自觉的行动目标。个别厂的职工在五月份上半月津市物价波动时，对工资折实发生疑难，但厂方未能耐心地进行解释与适当解决。也有的厂在开始实行精简时没有对职工进行深入的思想教育。这些都或多或少地影响了职工的生产情绪。
    为迎接“七一”中国共产党诞生节日的到来，津市各公营工厂在检讨五月份的生产成绩与缺点之后，已相继拟订了六月份的生产计划，以创造更大的生产成绩。
