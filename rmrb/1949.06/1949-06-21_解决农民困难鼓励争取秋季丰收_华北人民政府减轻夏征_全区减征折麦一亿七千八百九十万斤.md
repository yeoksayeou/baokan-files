    [Special Dispatch from this Newspaper] In light of the poor wheat harvest this year and the successive outbreaks of insect pests in various regions, the North China People's Government, in order to take care of farmers' livelihoods, resolve their difficulties, increase their purchasing power, encourage their enthusiasm for active production, strive for and guarantee a bumper or relatively good autumn harvest this year, and support the Liberation War, has decided to appropriately reduce the summer grain tax burden. The total summer grain tax reduction for the entire region is 204,450,000 jin of millet (equivalent to 178,890,000 jin of wheat). Specifically, Jizhong will reduce its tax burden by 38% of the amount it should bear, Taiyuan region by 35%, Jinan by 25%, and the remaining Taihang, Taiyue, and Chahar regions by 20% each. Jiluyu will reduce by 10%, and Jidong by 5%. The reduction figures are determined based on the severity of drought, insect pests, and frost damage in various regions, as well as the extent of enemy destruction, the impact of the war, and the specific living conditions of the people. For example, Jizhong has experienced more severe drought this year; in eight counties and one city, including Anguo, Anping, Xinle, Raoyang, and Suning, the drought-affected area has reached over 80,000 mu, with more than 50,000 mu suffering yield reductions of up to 80%. In Mudao Gou and the west bank of the Dasha River in Xinle, many wheat fields have been submerged by wind and sand. Ningjin, Renqiu, Lecheng, and Qingyuan counties have experienced insect infestations. According to statistics from 11 villages in the fourth district of Ningjin County, 49% of the wheat has been damaged by spider mites. Therefore, the tax reduction ratio for Jizhong is particularly large. The 20-plus counties surrounding Taiyuan have been liberated for about a year, and although agricultural production has greatly recovered, drought and frost damage this year are also very serious. In particular, the Yan Xishan bandit gang's "soldier-peasant integration" tyrannical rule over the years has bankrupted the farmers, and they have fully supported the Taiyuan Campaign. Therefore, the summer grain tax reduction this year is also relatively large. Jinan has suffered from widespread drought, insect pests, and hail, so the tax reduction ratio is second only to the Taiyuan region. The remaining Taihang, Taiyue, and Chahar regions, in addition to minor droughts, have suffered from frost and hail in Taihang and Taiyue, and Chahar has also experienced cattle plague. The disaster situation is generally similar, so the tax reduction ratio is the same. Although some areas of Jiluyu and Jidong have experienced drought, insect pests, and hail this year, compared to the entire North China region, the rainfall has been better, and the wheat harvest is also better than other regions. Therefore, the tax reduction ratio is the lowest. In addition, the government is stopping the mobilization of civilian labor and actively helping farmers organize various forms of production. At the same time, it is streamlining administration and launching a conservation campaign to save financial expenditures. To make it easier for farmers to pay their taxes, the summer grain tax can be partially paid in cotton, peanuts, cottonseed, and cash. The summer grain tax collection work is about to begin throughout the region. All localities must conscientiously investigate the disaster situation, the wounds of war, and the living conditions of the masses, and strive to make the distribution of figures fair and reasonable, so that disaster-stricken households receive the necessary reductions and exemptions.

### 解决农民困难鼓励争取秋季丰收  华北人民政府减轻夏征  全区减征折麦一亿七千八百九十万斤

    解决农民困难鼓励争取秋季丰收
    华北人民政府减轻夏征
    全区减征折麦一亿七千八百九十万斤
    【本报特讯】华北人民政府鉴于今年夏麦歉收，目前各地又先后发生虫害，为照顾农民生活，解决农民困难，提高农民购买力，并鼓励农民积极生产的热忱，争取并保证今年秋季丰收或较好的秋收，及照顾支持解放战争，决定适当减轻夏征任务。全区夏征减征小米二亿零四百四十五万斤（折麦一亿七千八百九十万斤），计冀中按应负担数减征百分之三十八，太原区减征百分之三十五，冀南减征百分之二十五，其余太行、太岳、察哈尔三区各减征百分之二十，冀鲁豫减征百分之十，冀东减征百分之五。减征数字系根据各地旱虫霜灾轻重和敌人破坏与战争影响及人民具体生活情况决定，如冀中今年旱象较为严重，以安国、安平、新乐、饶阳、肃宁等八县一市，旱灾面积即达八万余亩，其中五万多亩减收竟达百分之八十；新乐木道沟、大沙河西岸，不少麦地为风沙淹没；宁晋、任邱、乐城、清苑等县则发生虫灾，宁晋县据四区十一个村统计，百分之四十九的麦子被火蛛子糟害。故冀中减征比例特大。太原周围二十余县，解放已经一年左右，农业生产虽已有很大的恢复，但是今年旱霜灾害亦很严重，特别是阎匪几年来的“兵农合一”暴政，弄得农民都破了产，并以全力支援了太原战役，故今年夏征减征亦较多。冀南除普遍受旱又遭虫雹等灾，因此减征比例仅次于太原地区。其余太行、太岳、察哈尔，除轻微旱灾外，太行、太岳受霜灾雹灾，察哈尔并有牛瘟，灾情状况大体相似，故减征比例相同。冀鲁豫与冀东若干地区今年虽有旱、虫、雹灾，然以华北全区来说，则雨量较好，麦收亦较各区为佳，故减征比例数字最少。此外政府一方面停止动员民力，积极帮助农民组织各种生产，一方面进行精简，开展节约运动，以节省财政开支。为使农民缴纳负担方便起见，在夏征任务中，允许各地折征一部分棉花、花生、棉籽和现款，现全区麦征工作即将开始，各地必须认真调查灾情和战争创伤与群众生活情况，分配数字务求做到公平合理，使受灾户得到应有的减免。
