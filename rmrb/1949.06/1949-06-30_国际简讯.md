International Briefs

    Reports from various sources: 24,000 coal miners across Australia went on strike on the 27th. The miners are demanding a 15 percent increase in wages (thirty Australian shillings), a reduction in the weekly working hours from forty to thirty-six, and the nationalization of the industry, but these demands have been rejected. The coal mine strike has forced many industrial enterprises to shut down, with 500,000 workers ceasing work due to the lack of coal and electricity supply.
    Free Greece Radio broadcast: Representatives of Greek democratic public organizations, scientists, and various sectors of the working people recently established a permanent peace committee in Greece and decided to convene a national peace congress of Greece.
    TASS News Agency: The national committee for striving for the release of Lehman, chairman of the Communist Party of West Germany, initiated by anti-fascist democratic parties and organizations, was established in Berlin on the 22nd.
