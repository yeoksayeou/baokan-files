　　Central and Southern Hebei
  　Welcome Rain Falls
  　Late Seedlings Now Being Rushed for Planting
    [Jizhong Electric] On the afternoon of the 25th, rain fell generally in Central Hebei. By the 26th, all of the Ninth District and the area west of Xinji in the Eleventh District had received thorough rainfall. All of the Tenth District and the area west of the Jinpu Railway in the Eighth District received four or five *zhi* of rain, which can sustain moisture. Light rain fell in Tianjin, Jinghai, Huanghua, and other counties, sufficient for the planting of late-season crops in most areas. Aphids on cotton can be weakened or eliminated as a result. After the rapid growth of rice seedlings, this can prevent damage from stem borers.
    [Jinan Electric] On June 25th, rain fell generally in the Southern Hebei District. In the First District, Qiu County and Guantao received four *zhi* of rain, while Linqing, Shen County, Guan County, Yongzhi, and Wuxun received one or two *zhi* of rain. Seven counties in the Second District received light rain. In the Third District, all nine counties including Handan and Jize received thorough rainfall, while Daming and Wei County received one or two *zhi* of rain. In the Fourth District, the northern three districts of Baixiang, Julu, Guangzong, and Wei County have received thorough rain. Nanhe, Ren County, Zhentang, and Longyao all received three or four *zhi* of rain. The Fifth District generally received one *zhi* of rain. Counties that have received rain are now launching a surprise effort to rush-plant late seedlings. Areas that have not received thorough rain are still implementing drought resistance to protect seedlings.

(*translator's note: A "*zhi*" is an old unit of measurement of length, approximately equal to the width of an adult's fingers when held together.)

　　冀中冀南
  　普降喜雨
  　现正抢种晚苗
    【冀中电】二十五日下午，冀中普遍落雨，到二十六日九分区全部，十一分区辛集以西落透，十分区全部，八分区津浦路以西均落四，五指雨，能接上湿，天津、静海、黄骅等县小雨，绝大部分能进行晚田播种，棉花上蚜虫可以因此削弱或消灭。谷苗迅速成长后，可以阻止钻心虫为害。
    【冀南电】六月二十五日，冀南区普遍落雨，一专区邱县馆陶落四指雨，临清、莘县、冠县、永智、武训均落一、二指雨。二专区七县微雨。三专区邯郸、鸡泽等九县全部下透，大名、魏县落雨一、二指。四专区柏乡、巨鹿、广宗、威县北部三个区已落透雨。南和、任县、振堂、隆尧均下三、四指雨。五专区普下一指雨。已落雨县份现正突击抢种晚苗，未得透雨地区仍贯彻抗旱保苗。
