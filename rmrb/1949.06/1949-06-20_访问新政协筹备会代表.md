　　Visiting Representatives of the Preparatory Committee of the New Political Consultative Conference

　　Representative of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang, Madam He Xiangning

　　Madam He Xiangning said: I am extremely happy to see the convening of the New Political Consultative Conference today. I have been separated from the Kuomintang for twenty-two years, and I have never yielded to the Kuomintang reactionaries. My wish has finally been realized after twenty-two years. Today, I have personally witnessed the freedom and liberation of the Chinese people. Thanks to Chairman Mao's wise leadership, the future of the New Political Consultative Conference is bright. At the same time, we should pay high tribute to the heroic People's Liberation Army. How much blood of brave warriors was shed to achieve today's victory. In the future, we should work harder to transform China from an agricultural country into an industrial country, but this cannot be achieved overnight. We must develop China's backward productive forces, and we still have much arduous work to do.

　　Madam He Xiangning placed great expectations on the cause of the liberation of Chinese women. She said: If Chinese women are completely liberated and participate in revolutionary work, the power will be very great. Finally, she talked about the task of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang in participating in this meeting, the most important of which is to truly serve the people, unite and cooperate with all parties, and jointly build a new democratic China.

　　Representative of the China Democratic League, Mr. Zhang Bojun, said:

　　After the Chinese Communist Party issued the May 1st call, the Democratic League was the first to respond. In this preparatory meeting of the New Political Consultative Conference, everyone, in a spirit of unity, understood and consulted with each other, and transformed different opinions into the same opinions. The organizations or individuals participating in the meeting can indeed have different opinions, but there should be no differences in principle; it is like walking on the same avenue, some can walk faster, some can walk slower, but cannot walk in the east and west directions, then the farther you go, the farther you get, and you cannot walk together. I hope that all parties and organizations will be jointly responsible for politics, and not play the role of an opposition party in the wilderness. We believe that this New Political Consultative Conference will be successful. Under the leadership of the Communist Party, we will formulate a common political program that everyone will abide by, and establish a plan for the organization of a coalition government. Internationally, we will crush the Anglo-American aggression conspiracy in the Pacific, thoroughly complete land reform domestically, implement industrial and commercial policies, develop culture and education well, consolidate and unify the currency system in finance and finance, and at the same time, be independent and autonomous in diplomacy, and cooperate more closely with socialist countries and new democratic countries to protect world peace.

　　Representative of the China Democratic National Construction Association, Mr. Huang Yanpei

　　First, comparing the essential differences between the old and new political consultatives, he said: The old political consultative was presided over by the Kuomintang reactionaries. They accounted for the majority in the meeting. At that time, the democratic parties such as the CCP and the Democratic League were in the minority, so we had to make concessions on many issues. Today is different. The representatives of all units participating in the New Political Consultative Conference are full of revolutionary spirit, and fundamentally there will be no reactionaries participating. Chiang Kai-shek betrayed his faith and completely tore up the resolutions of the old political consultative, which aroused the anger of the people across the country at that time. Thinking about it now, if a coalition government had been established at that time, he might have come up with many tricks, and the country might have been even worse, and even sacrificed the lives of tens of millions of people, which is such a painful thing.

　　Mr. Huang continued to talk about the brewing process of the New Political Consultative Conference, saying: The democratic parties wanted to hold the New Political Consultative Conference last year, but the domestic and international conditions at that time were not fully mature, and the military development was far inferior to today. Now all the conditions are mature. I think that not only the people in the liberated areas hope that the preparatory meeting of the New Political Consultative Conference will be held at this time, but also the people in the areas that have not yet been liberated also hope so. If the New Political Consultative Conference was held last year, its central task should be in the military field, and today it should be a political task.

　　On the day the preparatory meeting opened (the 15th), when Mr. Huang passed through Xinhua Gate and arrived at Qin Zheng Dian, he was deeply moved when recalling the past. He said that in the past forty years, he had gone through the four major turning points in China. The first was the Xinhai Revolution, which overthrew the Qing Dynasty; the second was Yuan Shikai's claiming of the emperor, which was overthrown by the people; the third was the War of Resistance Against Japan, which accepted the surrender of Japan; and the fourth was the People's Liberation War, which overthrew the reactionary rule of Chiang Kai-shek. From these four major turning points, everyone should recognize one point: the power of the people is irresistible.

　　Representative of non-party democratic personages, Mr. Guo Moruo, said:

　　The New Political Consultative Conference has been brewing for more than a year, and the recent establishment of the preparatory committee can be said to be a natural course. It is indeed a good start to a new era. There are twenty-three units participating in this New Political Consultative Conference, including all democratic parties and progressive people. This proves that our united front is unprecedentedly expanded and sincerely united. We can foresee that the formal meeting to be held soon will have a better performance. Today, under the leadership of Chairman Mao, we must take a further step to overcome our years of backwardness and rapidly complete the construction of new democracy. The expansion and consolidation of the democratic united front is the most exciting thing for us. In the future, we must make our lineup more united and consolidated, so that the construction work will be completed more smoothly. All peace-loving people in the world are expecting us to do so, so this is also a very important factor for the liberation cause of the whole world. We are representatives of the Chinese people, and we should strengthen our awareness of self-reliance. We bear a very important mission and must not let down the expectations of the people across the country and the people of the world. From the perspective of our intellectuals, we must also strengthen our awareness and combine mental labor with physical labor. Our cultural people carry too heavy a burden. We carry the burden of feudal ideas for more than 2,000 years and the burden of imperialist comprador ideas for more than 100 years, and we have always been separated from production. Culture has become a decoration, especially natural science. It is like a bunch of Western flowers inserted in an antique porcelain vase. It has not taken root in the land of China and in the hearts of the people, and it has not made a good contribution. We, the people engaged in cultural science, have always been arrogant, and this burden needs to be discarded. If the ancients said, "Everything is inferior, only studying is noble." Then we say, "Everything is superior, only those who talk nonsense are not noble."

　　Today we should learn to serve the people, and integrate all sciences and technologies with the people's lives and practical needs, so that our cultural and academic workers can make contributions to the new China. In the future, after the establishment of the New Political Consultative Conference, representatives of the cultural and academic circles will participate. We hope that our friends in the cultural and academic circles will first start with themselves and truly achieve the close cooperation between intellectuals and workers and peasants to complete the glorious cause of national construction. Judging from the performance of the representatives at this conference, it also makes us optimistic. Everyone has a common understanding. I hope that we will be determined to work hard, be pragmatic, and work hard in our own positions today, so that we can fulfill the expectations of the people across the country. There are many problems before us, and there are also places in the world that require our joint efforts. In the future, we must sincerely accept the strong leadership of the CCP and bravely move forward under the banner of Chairman Mao.

　　Representative of non-party democratic personages, Mr. Fu Dingyi

　　Fu Dingyi felt boundless excitement and joy at the convening of the preparatory meeting of the New Political Consultative Conference. He said: "This meeting is to mobilize all the people's democratic forces across the country to support new democracy, oppose imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucrat-capitalism, overthrow the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang, and establish a people's democratic republic. This is such an important, great, and glorious thing!"

　　He said: "The revolution is about to win a complete victory. First, we must praise the greatness of Chairman Mao's leadership; second, we must praise the efforts of the people; third, we must comfort the hard work and merits of the soldiers on the front and rear; and fourth, we wish a complete victory and the liberation of the people across the country."

　　Representative of non-party democratic personages, Mr. Wu Yaozong, said:

　　Today, when the War of Liberation has actually won a complete victory, the convening of the New Political Consultative Conference has epoch-making significance. Not long ago, due to the distorted propaganda of imperialism and the prejudices of those who believed in the old democracy, there were still many people who took a skeptical and hostile attitude towards the Chinese revolution. Now, the iron facts have shattered these propaganda and prejudices. The success of this revolution is because it has won the support of the vast majority of the people, and because it meets the needs of all the Chinese people. This power of the people has overthrown the most stubborn and corrupt rule, and has overthrown the most sinister imperialist conspiracy.

　　Now several imperialist countries are so-called Christian countries, but they have not implemented the Christian doctrines of freedom, equality, and fraternity, but are only using Christianity as a tool of rule. The time has come for Christianity to liberate itself from the traditions of capitalism and imperialism and become a constructive force in a new era. We believe that under the principle of freedom of belief, in a new society, true Christianity will be further developed.

　　Representative of the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party, Mr. Peng Zemin, said:

　　This New Political Consultative Conference is fundamentally different from the past Old Political Consultative Conference. The Old Political Consultative Conference was reluctantly formed by the counter-revolutionary pseudo-Kuomintang, which followed the instructions of American imperialism. Its purpose was to abduct the people and stop the high tide of the people's liberation, and it was undoubtedly a counter-revolutionary action representing bureaucratic capital. Its result, of course, became a scam. This New Political Consultative Conference is just the opposite of the Old Political Consultative Conference. It is based on the spontaneous demands of the people across the country, convened by people who truly represent people from all walks of life, organizations, democratic parties, and overseas Chinese, under the belief of new democracy, to jointly discuss and work together to build a new China. Thanks to the correct leadership of the Communist Party of China and its leader, Mr. Mao Zedong, in addition to taking the interests of the working class and peasantry as the main body, it also takes care of the interests of all classes. Therefore, this New Political Consultative Conference, I believe, will definitely achieve great success and will become the starting point of China's new history. This is what we feel most happy and excited about. Although it is now in the preparatory stage, thinking of the old saying that "everything is difficult at the beginning", as long as the foundation is laid, the result must be satisfactory.

### 访问新政协筹备会代表

　　访问新政协筹备会代表
  　中国国民党革命委员会代表何香凝先生
    何香凝先生说：今天我能看到新政协的召开，我高兴极了。我脱离国民党到现在已经二十二年了，我从来没有向国民党反动派屈服过，二十二年来我的愿望终于实现了。我今天已经亲眼看到中国人民的自由解放。由于毛主席贤明的领导，新政协的前途是光明的。同时我们应该向英勇的人民解放军致崇高的敬意，不知流了多少勇士的血，才换得今天的胜利。今后我们应更加努力，使中国由农业国变成工业国，但这不是一下子可以做得到的，我们要把中国落后的生产力发展起来，我们还要做许多的艰苦工作。
    何香凝先生对中国妇女的解放事业，寄予莫大的期望，她说：中国妇女如果完全得到解放，参加革命工作，这力量是非常伟大的。最后她谈到国民党革命委员会参加这次会议的任务，最主要的是真正作到为人民服务，和各党派团结合作，共同建设新民主主义的新中国。
    中国民主同盟代表章伯钧先生说：
    中国共产党发出五一号召以后，民盟首先响应。这次新政协的筹备会议，大家以团结的精神，互相了解，互相协商，变不同的意见为相同的意见。参加会议的团体或个人，诚然可以有不同的意见，但不能有原则的区别；譬如同走一条大道，有的可以走得快点，有的可以走得慢点，但不能走东西两个方向，那就越走越远，不能同行了。希望各党派团体都共同向政治负责，不以什么在野的身份来个什么反对派。我们相信这次新政协一定会开得成功的，在共产党领导下，订立一个大家遵守的共同政治纲领，确立联合政府组织的方案。在国际间粉碎英美在太平洋上的侵略阴谋，在国内彻底完成土改，实施工商业政策，文化教育能很好发展，财政金融方面整理并统一币制，同时在外交方面独立自主，与社会主义国家及新民主主义国家更密切的合作，保障世界的和平。
    民主建国会代表黄炎培先生
    首先比较新旧政协本质上的不同，他说：旧政协是由国民党反动派主持的，他们在会议中占多数，当时中共、民盟等民主党派是少数，所以我们不得不在许多问题上有所迁就。今天不同了，参加新政协的各单位代表都富有革命精神的，根本上不会有反动分子参加的了。蒋介石背信弃义，彻底撕毁了旧政协的决议，当时激起了全国人的愤怒。现在想起来，设若当时成立了联合政府，说不定他还要搞出多少花样，恐怕国家还要糟糕下去，就是牺牲了上千万老百姓的生命，这是多么悲痛的一件事。
    黄先生继就新政协的酝酿过程谈称：各民主党派去年就想举行新政协，但那时的国内外条件还没有完全成熟，军事发展也远不如今天，现在则一切条件成熟了，我想，不但解放区人民希望新政协筹备会在此时召开，就是尚未解放地区的人民也同样希望。假如新政协在去年召开，它的中心任务应在军事方面，而今天则应是以政治工作为中心任务了。
    筹备会开幕那一天（十五日），当黄先生经过新华门到达勤政殿的时候，缅怀往事，很有感触。他说，四十年来他经过了中国的四个大关头，第一个是辛亥革命，推翻了满清；第二个是袁世凯称帝，被人民打倒；第三个是对日抗战，接受了日本投降；第四是人民解放战争打倒了蒋介石的反动统治。从这四大关头中，大家应该认清一点：人民的力量是不可抗的。
    无党派民主人士代表郭沫若先生说：
    新政协酝酿已有一年多，最近成立筹备会，这可以说是水到成渠了。的确是新时代一个很好的开始。这次参加新政协的单位有二十三个，各民主党派、进步人士都包括在里面了。这证明我们联合阵线是空前的扩大和精诚的团结。我们可以预想到不久召开的正式会议会有更好的表现。今天在毛主席的领导下，我们要更跨进一步，克服我们多年来的落后，使新民主主义建设事业迅速完成。民主联合阵线的扩大和巩固，这是使我们最兴奋的。今后要使我们的阵容内部更加团结巩固，这样建设工作就会更加顺利完成。全世界爱好和平的人民都是这样期待我们，因此这对整个世界的解放事业也是一个很重要的因素。我们是中国人民的代表，应该加强自立的觉悟，我们负的使命非常重大，不要辜负全国人民与全世界人民的期望。从我们知识分子来讲，也要加强自己的觉悟，应该把脑力劳动和体力劳动结合起来。我们文化人背的包袱太重了，我们背了两千多年来的封建思想的包袱和一百来年的帝国主义买办思想的包袱，而且向来是和生产脱离的，文化成了装饰品，特别是自然科学，好象是在古瓷花瓶里插了一束西洋花，在中国的土地上和人民大众的心里没有扎下根去，也没有很好的贡献。我们从事文化科学的人，向来是自高自大，这个包袱需要丢掉。如果古人说“万般皆下品，唯有读书高”。那我们就说“万般皆上品，唯有空口说白话的人什么也不高”。
    今天我们应该学会为人民服务，使一切科学，技术与人民生活和实际需要结合起来，这样我们的文化学术工作者，才能对新中国有所贡献。将来新政协成立后，有文化学术界的代表参加，希望我们文化学术界的朋友，首先要从自己本身做起，真正做到知识分子与工农亲密携手，完成光荣的建国大业。从这次大会各代表的表现来看，也使我们乐观，大家已经有了共同的认识，希望我们今天决心苦干，实事求是，站在自己的岗位上努力工作，这样才能完成全国人民的期望。摆在我们眼前的问题很多，世界也有需要我们共同努力的地方，今后我们一定要诚恳的接受中共坚强的领导，在毛主席的旗帜下，勇敢地向前进。
    无党派民主人士代表符定一先生
    符定一对于新政协筹备会的召开，感到无上的兴奋与愉快。他说：“这个会是动员全国一切人民民主力量，拥护新民主主义，反帝、反封建、反官僚资本，推翻国民党反动统治，建立人民民主共和国。这是多么重要，多么伟大，多么光荣的一件事！”
    他说：“革命将近全面胜利，我们第一要歌颂毛主席领导的伟大；第二要赞成人民的努力；第三要慰藉前线及后方战士的劳苦功高；第四预祝全面胜利及全国人民之解放。”
    无党派民主人士代表吴耀宗先生说：
    在解放战争实际上已经完全胜利的今日，新政协的召开是具有划时代意义的，在不久以前，由于帝国主义歪曲的宣传，由于迷信旧民主主义者的成见，还有不少的人对于中国革命采取怀疑和敌视的态度，现在铁一般的事实，已经把这些宣传和成见打得粉碎。这个革命所以成功，是因为他得到绝大多数人民的拥护，是因为符合了中国全体人民的需要。这个人民的力量，打倒了最顽固的腐恶统治，打倒了最险毒的帝国主义的阴谋。
    现在几个帝国主义的国家，都是所谓基督教国家，其实并没有实行基督教的自由、平等、博爱的教义，而只是在利用基督教作统治的工具，时候到了，基督教应当把自己从资本主义、帝国主义传统中解放出来，变成一个新时代的建设力量，我们相信在信仰自由的原则下，在一个新的社会中，真正的基督教，将得到更大的发展。
    中国农工民主党代表彭泽民先生说：
    这一次的新政协会议与过去的旧政协会议是根本不相同的。旧政协会议是反革命的伪国民党，秉执了美帝国主义的旨意，勉强开成的。他的目的在拐卖人民，制止人民要达解放的高潮，无疑的是代表官僚资本的反革命行动，其结果当然成为一场骗局。这次新政协与旧政协刚刚相反，它是基于全国人民自动的要求，由真正代表全国各阶层各职业团体的人士和各民主党派及海外华侨，在新民主主义的信念下所召集的，共同协商共同努力建设新中国。由于中国共产党及其领袖毛泽东先生的正确领导，在以工农阶级的利益为主体外，还照顾到各阶层的利益，所以这次的新政协，相信一定可以获致伟大的成功，而且将要成为中国新历史的开始点，这是我们感到最愉快最兴奋的。现在虽然是筹备阶段，想到“万事起头难”一句老话，只要基础打好了，结果一定是美满的。
