North China People's Government Directs Governments at All Levels to Prepare for Flood Control Early

[Reported by this newspaper] On June 3rd, the North China People's Government issued instructions on flood control work to all administrative offices, municipal governments, and river affairs bureaus and water conservancy bureaus of all administrative districts. The original text is as follows:

The rainy season is approaching, and the flood season is imminent. The following instructions are specifically made for this year's flood control work:

1. Continue to Complete and Inspect Spring Works. As of now, the spring works of various rivers have been completed, mostly completed, or only partially completed due to various reasons. The progress of the work is uneven. Strict inspection should be carried out on completed projects, and unqualified projects should be remedied. Unfinished projects must be completed before the major flood season, and engineering requirements must be strictly implemented.

2. Prepare Materials for Dangerous Sections. Sufficient materials must be prepared for the main dikes and major dangerous sections of each river and transported to the work section before the flood season. A certain amount of materials also needs to be prepared in nearby villages for minor dangerous sections, to be transported and used as needed. Overcome the past phenomena of material shortages during emergencies, delaying rescue efforts, and waste and losses caused by improper storage.

3. Unified Leadership, Responsibility Divided by Section. In principle, a unified flood control headquarters should be established with each river as a unit, composed of responsible cadres dispatched by local Party and government leading organs and river affairs departments. If a river passes through one special district, the special commissioner's office is responsible for forming the headquarters; if a river passes through two or more special districts but does not leave an administrative office district, the relevant special districts are responsible for forming the headquarters, with representatives from the administrative office participating; if a river passes through two or more administrative office districts, the relevant administrative office and special commissioner's office are responsible for jointly forming the headquarters, with representatives from the North China People's Government participating; however, if a river is too long, a headquarters can also be organized in the upper and lower reaches in conjunction with administrative divisions for ease of command and rescue. Under the river system headquarters, county headquarters or flood control sections are set up according to administrative divisions or dike sections. During the major flood season, the main responsible persons of the local government must personally go to the dikes, play the role of administrative leadership, and conduct detailed organization and education of the civilian rescue teams before the flood season.

4. Clarify Responsibilities, Enforce Strict Rewards and Punishments. In the past, river breaches were due to the large amount of water, but also due to negligence in defense. This irresponsible phenomenon must be resolutely corrected. After the river section is divided, responsibilities must be clarified, and reward and punishment methods must be specified. Rewards and punishments must be strict and timely. If a breach is caused by irresponsibility rather than irresistible circumstances, no excuses are allowed, and administrative sanctions should be given to the personnel concerned based on the actual situation; cadres and masses who are actively responsible, make efforts to defend, and turn danger into safety should be rewarded.

5. Strengthen Upstream and Downstream Communication and Water Situation Reporting. Accurate and timely掌握water situation is an important part of flood control command. To achieve this, it is necessary to strengthen upstream and downstream communication and flood reporting work. The upstream administrative organs and river affairs organs have the responsibility to report water floods to the downstream, and this should be listed as one of the important tasks during continuous rain and rising river water. To ensure that flood reporting is rapid and accurate, each river should set up temporary or permanent hydrological stations in the upper, middle, and lower reaches, and install radios and telephones to report the water situation at any time; in areas where there are no conditions to install radios and telephones, strengthen the flood control pass work to ensure that the water situation is well-informed and to gain the initiative in time.

North China is the most vigorous place in the mainland climate, with nine droughts in ten years, and this year is no exception. It is certain that the summer rainfall will be concentrated, so the threat of "spring drought and autumn flood" is already in front of us. On the other hand, North China has been completely liberated, and most of the rivers have been in disrepair for many years. This year, only dangerous sections have been repaired, and the general dikes have not been strengthened. Therefore, this year's flood control task is unprecedentedly arduous and serious. In order to protect the fruits of the first year of peaceful production in the entire region from being damaged, and to protect the dikes from being destroyed, laying the foundation for further construction, governments at all levels along the river and the people must be urgently mobilized to carry out flood control preparations, oppose complacency and the mentality of trying to get by with luck. When the flood season arrives, vigorously defend, and conduct in-depth mobilization and education of cadres and the masses, establish an overall ideology, overcome departmentalism and localism, and prevent any disputes arising from conflicts of interest; raise vigilance, prepare fully, strengthen unity, strictly prevent sabotage of flood control by saboteurs, and strive together for the victory of flood control.

### 华北人民政府指示各级政府　及早准备防汛

　　华北人民政府指示各级政府
  　及早准备防汛
    【本报讯】华北人民政府于六月三日向各行署、盛市政府，各行署区河务局、水利局发出关于防汛工作的指示。原文如下：
    现雨季将到，伏汛即来，对今年防汛工作特作如下指示：
    一、继续完成与检查春工。截至现在止，各河春工由于种种原因，有的业已完成，有的完成大部，有的完成小部，工作发展是不平衡的。对于已完工程应进行严格的检查，不合格者设法补救，未完工程务必于大汛前完成，并严格执行工程要求。
    二、险工备料。各河主要堤防主要险工必须准备充足的料物，汛前运至工段。次要险工也需要在附近村庄筹定一定数量的料物，随用随运。克服过去险象发生，料不凑手，贻误抢护及保管不当所造成的浪费和损失现象。
    三、统一领导分段负责。原则上以河流为单位建立统一的防汛指挥部，由当地党政领导机关及河务部门派负责干部组成。河流经过一专区者，即由专署负责组成；河流经过两专区以上而未出一行署区者，由有关专区负责组成，行署派人参加；河流经过两行署以上者，由有关行署专署负责协同组成，华北人民政府派人参加；但河流太长，为便于指挥抢护，亦可分上游下游结合行政区划组织指挥部。河系指挥部下，按行政区划或堤段设县指挥部或防汛段。大汛期间，地方政府主要负责人必须亲自上堤，发挥行政领导作用，并在汛前对民工抢险队进行细密的组织与教育。
    四、明确职责，严明赏罚。过去各河决口，水大虽是一个重要原因，但由于疏于防守者亦不在少数，此种对人民不负责的现象，必须坚决纠正。河段划分后，要明确职责，规定奖惩办法，赏罚要严明及时，如果不是不可抗拒的情况而是由于不负责任招致决口，任何借口都是不允许的，并要针对实际情形，对有关人员给以行政处分；对积极负责，努力防守，化险为夷的干部群众，给以奖励。
    五、加强上下游联系与水情报告。正确地及时地掌握水情是指挥防汛的重要环节。要作到这一点，必须加强上下游联系与报汛工作。上游的行政机关与河务机关有责任向下游报告水汛，并在阴雨连绵河水盛涨时期应列为重要工作之一。为使报汛迅速确实、各河应在上游、中游、下游设临时的或永久的水文站，并安置电台、电话，随时报告水情；在无条件安设电台、电话的地区，加强汛工传签工作，务使水情灵通，争取时间上的主动。
    华北为大陆气候最健旺之地，十年九旱，今年又是如此。夏季雨量集中是肯定的了，所以“春旱秋涝”的威胁是已经摆在我们面前。另一方面华北全部解放，大部河流多年失修，今年只是择险修整，一般的堤防，没有加强。因此，今年的防汛任务是空前艰巨而严重的。为了保护全区第一年和平生产的成果不受损害，为了保护堤防不被破坏，打下进一步建设的基础，沿河各级政府及人民必须紧急动员起来，进行防汛的准备工作，反对麻痹大意、企图侥幸的苟安心理。汛期到来，大力防守，并对干部群众进行深入动员教育，树立整体思想，克服本位主义、地方主义，并防止因利害关系所发生的任何纠纷；提高警惕，充分准备，加强团结，严防破坏分子破坏防汛的行为，共同为争取防汛胜利而奋斗。
