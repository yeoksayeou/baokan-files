    Tianjin Automotive Transport Company
    Suffers Heavy Losses Due to Poor Management;
    Improvement Measures Formulated
    [Tianjin Dispatch] The Tianjin Automotive Transport Company, directly under the North China Highway Bureau, has decided to improve its operations and reverse its losses. Since its establishment three and a half months ago, the company has traveled over 300,000 kilometers, transported more than 40,000 passengers, and carried over 400 tons of luggage and goods. The number of operational vehicles has increased from 18 at the start of operations on February 10th to 69 in May. It is expected to increase to nearly 100 by the end of this month. However, in terms of revenue, the company has been losing a significant amount of money each month, totaling over 7 million yuan (with total revenue of over 25 million yuan). The main reasons for the losses are: the business lacks detailed investigation and research into passenger and freight transport conditions, adhering to the practice of "scheduled buses not running other routes," resulting in vehicles not being flexibly deployed and often running empty; a lack of understanding of actual conditions, subjectively setting fares, which are generally set too low; and the lack of specific allocation of vehicles, leading to drivers shirking responsibility and not taking care of vehicles. For example, in May, the 69 running vehicles averaged six major, medium, and minor repairs each, and frequently experienced breakdowns on the road. 工务救济车 (Engineering Relief Vehicles) consumed over 950 gallons of gasoline, accounting for 3.3% of total revenue. In addition, the cumbersome accounting procedures failed to solve practical problems, and there was a lack of planning, even a lack of understanding of revenue and expenditure, making it difficult to identify and remedy problems in a timely manner. In response to the above situation, in order to reverse the losses, the company has now decided to strengthen planning, adjust its organization, shift staff and workers who are not essential in their current roles to direct production departments, increase passenger and freight vehicles, appropriately adjust transportation routes, vehicle allocation, and flexible utilization; at the same time, organize a factory management committee, implement democratic management, improve the accounting system, and continue to organize freight transport and strengthen the exchange of goods between urban and rural areas. In addition, the company is calling for the implementation of a conductor responsibility system, strict adherence to working hours, and strengthened sense of responsibility.

    天津汽车运输公司
    经营不善亏损甚多
    现已拟定改进办法
    【天津电】华北公路总局直属天津汽车运输公司决定改进业务，转变亏损现象。该公司营业三个半月以来，共行驶三十余万公里，运客四万余人，载行李及货物四百多吨，能行驶的车辆已由二月十日开始营业时之十八辆，增至五月份之六十九辆，预计本月底可增达近百辆。但在收入方面，则每月蚀本甚多，总计已共达七百万余元（总收入为二千五百余万元）。亏损的主要原因是：营业上没有详细调查研究客货运输情况，因袭“班车不跑别线”的作风，以致车辆不能灵活调动，时常空驶；不了解实际情况，主观的订定票价，一般都订的较低；车辆没有具体分配，形成司机互相推诿不负责、不爱护车辆的现象。如五月份六十九辆跑车中，每辆平均大、中、小修六次，同时中途不时发生故障。工务救济车消耗汽油达九百五十余加仑，占总收入的百分之三·三。加以会计制度手续繁多，未能解决实际问题，没有计划，甚至不了解收支赢亏情形，对及时发现与补救也有很大妨碍。针对上述情况，为了转变亏损现象，该公司现已决定加强计划性，调整机构，使在工作上不太需要的职员、工役转向直接生产部门，并增加客货车辆，适当调整各运输线路，车辆之配备，灵活运用；同时组织工厂管理委员会，实行管理民主化，改进会计制度，及继续组织货运，加强城乡物资交流。此外，该公司并号召贯彻实行乘务负责制，严守工作时间，加强责任观念。
