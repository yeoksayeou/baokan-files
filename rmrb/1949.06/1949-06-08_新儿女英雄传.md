　　Chapter Five: The New Son-in-Law (Continued 1)
    After Hei Lao Cai returned, Zhang Jinlong quietly talked with him for a long time in the house. Hei Lao Cai was very happy, comforting him and encouraging him. Finally, Zhang Jinlong untied his leggings, took out a small packet of opium from his sock and handed it to Hei Lao Cai, saying, "I knew this was wrong a long time ago! Brother-in-law, if you had come earlier, I would have given it to you." Xiao Mei was listening outside the door, and at this time she walked in with a smile, deliberately saying to Hei Lao Cai, "Jinlong is still a sensible person. When people asked him to go, he wouldn't go." Zhang Jinlong boasted triumphantly, "Hah, would that be okay without this bit of ambition? Asking me to be a traitor, I wouldn't go even if you gave me gold and silver! Anyone who works with the Japanese is raised like a pampered girl!”
    The three people chatted for a while. Hei Lao Cai took the opportunity to quietly instruct Xiao Mei, "Jinlong is at a fork in the road right now, you have to influence him well. This guy is accurate with a gun and has some skills. It's best to try to get him to come out and work, and don't let the traitors pull him away!" Xiao Mei agreed. Hei Lao Cai then took his wife and children and said goodbye to Zhang Jinlong's family and returned.

　　II
    During the few days that Xiao Mei stayed at home, she took good care of Zhang Jinlong in his daily life, and also persuaded him day and night to try to get him to come out and work.
    On the sixth day, Xiao Mei was about to leave; the night before, before going to sleep, she said to Jinlong, "What are you going to do? If you want to leave, let's go together tomorrow." Zhang Jinlong sat in the quilt, smoking a cigarette, without saying a word. Xiao Mei said, "I work, and you work, it would be so good for both of us to improve together!" Jinlong said, "If you leave, and I leave, what about the old folks we leave behind?" Xiao Mei said with a smile, "Come on, cut it out! What can you do at home? If you go out, the village can at least give some preferential treatment."
    Zhang Jinlong threw away the cigarette butt, took off his jacket, shrank into the quilt, and said with a cheeky smile, "In the middle of the night, dry mouth and blurry eyes, let's sleep; don't just keep talking to me about this! Whether to go out or not, let's talk about it later." Xiao Mei pointed at him, "You, really! Still so wishy-washy. You've been loafing around at home, and it's spoiled you! Worker, peasant, soldier, student, merchant, which one are you? If you go out to resist Japan, I'll be proud; if you mess around at home, I'll be ashamed for you. If you're still so hopeless, we won't be able to live together!" Zhang Jinlong said, "Hey! You keep begging me to go out, what am I going to do out there?" Xiao Mei said, "You've been playing with guns for so many years, and you're pretty accurate with them; you're more popular fighting the Japanese than I am, why don't you join the army?"
    As soon as Zhang Jinlong heard about joining the army, he fell out with Xiao Mei. He turned over and said firmly, "I'm not going! The life of the Eighth Route Army is hard, who can stand it!" Xiao Mei talked until her mouth was dry, but he said, "Anyway, a person is like a muddy fish, wherever he ends up is where he ends up. You don't need to worry about me!"
    Xiao Mei saw that he was really hopeless, and she was also annoyed, and got up angrily, saying, "Okay, let's not talk about it! I think you should go be your traitor; live a life of eating, drinking, whoring, and gambling, lose your conscience, and it doesn't matter if you lose face!" Zhang Jinlong got angry and sat up suddenly, "What are you talking about! Who's going to be a traitor? Don't smear people's faces with dog poop!" Xiao Mei ignored him, moved her pillow to the other side, blew out the lamp, took off her clothes, and went to sleep. Zhang Jinlong also lay down angrily.
    The two people, one head facing east and one head facing west, were stiff for a long time. Zhang Jinlong couldn't hold back, moved his own pillow over, and said with a shameless smile, "Look at you, talk slowly, what's the hurry!" Xiao Mei said, "I'm telling you good things. People have to look far ahead and walk towards the light. Life in the Eighth Route Army is tough, but it's a righteous way to learn to be good. Look at me, I've only been working for a few days, and I know more things, I can read a letter, issue a note, and I can handle it; you're a grown man, and you don't even know how to read, you're not even as good as me. If you join, and work hard, you can be literate, you can be martial, you can improve year by year, you can have a future, you can have a chance to do something." Zhang Jinlong said mischievously, "I'm just afraid of going far away, and I won't bear to leave you!" Xiao Mei said, "Don't joke, let's talk seriously. If you're really afraid of going far away, let's ask Lao Cai, see if we can find a job in the county brigade." Zhang Jinlong said with a smile, "Won't that be great? If you had said this earlier, I would have been willing."
    The next day, Jinlong didn't even tell the old folks, and went with Xiao Mei to the district to find Hei Lao Cai.

　　III
    Niu Da Shui was also in the district, talking with Hei Lao Cai about some issues. The day after He Shixiong ran away, Shen Yaozong also sneaked away. Someone saw that He Goupi had been to Shen Yaozong's house the day before, acting suspiciously, not knowing what they were talking about. Da Shui said, "The fox and the badger are in cahoots, He Shixiong must have hooked him away." Hei Lao Cai nodded and said, "It's possible that He Shixiong deceived and propagandized, and incited him to leave. You must not make things difficult for his family, we will try to win him back later."
    County Party Secretary Cheng Ping came and talked with Hei Lao Cai for a while. Lao Cai said to Da Shui, "There have been some adjustments in the cadres recently. You go back and tell Shuangxi to come to the district to work immediately; you will serve as the village chief of the central village..." Da Shui rushed to say, "Ah! What about my squad leader position?" Hei Lao Cai said with a smile, "Don't worry! Gao Tuner will be the squad leader; you can also be the deputy squad leader." Cheng Ping instructed from the side, "Now that Shuangxi is gone, you can elect another Party branch secretary." Da Shui said, "Okay, okay."
    After talking for a while, Da Shui came out, thinking of going to the south room to find the assistant to get grain coupons and vegetable money; in the courtyard, he ran into Xiao Mei holding a child, followed by Zhang Jinlong, carrying a bedding roll, walking towards the north room. Da Shui was embarrassed to say hello, so he ran into the south room. Grain and forage assistant Gu Zichun was busy calculating with an abacus, Da Shui waited on the side, hearing the north room was quite lively, but he didn't know what they were talking about; he thought, "Why hasn't Zhang Jinlong been arrested yet?" He took the grain coupons and vegetable money out, and just happened to meet Xiao Mei and her family of three walking out.
    Zhang Jinlong nodded with a smile, "Da Shui, you're busy?" Da Shui said慌乱ly, "Oh—uh, where are you going?" Zhang Jinlong said excitedly, "It's been settled, I'm going to work in the county brigade." Saying that, the family of three walked out of the gate, and Da Shui ran angrily to ask Hei Lao Cai, "What's going on? You're giving a suspected traitor like Zhang Jinlong a job?" Lao Cai told him about Zhang Jinlong's transformation, and Da Shui understood; he couldn't say whether he was happy or frustrated, and returned to the central village.

　　IV
    Niu Da Shui became the head of the central village and also the deputy squad leader, and his work became even busier. The higher-ups repeatedly pointed out that he had to seize the time to study in order to do his work well. Da Shui and Gao Tuner and others took time to study with Teacher Zhou of the elementary school, and made rapid progress.
    One day, Da Shui was holding a newspaper, pointing with his fingers, reading aloud one word at a time. His father came to see him; as soon as they met, the old man said with a smile, "Boy, I've found you a good wife. She's from Xieliu Village, her surname is Zhu, her name is Cuihua, she's only eighteen years old, but she's a good girl! She's sure to be to your liking, to your style." Da Shui let his father sit down and said to him, "In these years, we can't even deal with our own stomachs, how can we afford to marry a wife?" The old man said with joy, "You don't know, I've been saving money for these years, I haven't been willing to spend a penny, I've saved some money for you; in these years, people are also in difficulty, they don't want this, they don't want that, they just want you to be an Eighth Route Army cadre, with good character. It won't cost much money anyway. Anyway, you don't have to worry about anything, I'll take care of everything." The old man grinned with his toothless mouth and laughed happily.
    Da Shui put down the newspaper and asked, "Can she read?" The old man was stunned and said, "Ah, I didn't ask that! Mostly she can't read. Hey, what do peasant women need to know how to read for?" Da Shui said with dissatisfaction, "I don't want someone who can't read!" Angered, the old man raised his beard and pointed at him, saying, "You've only learned a few dog-paw words, and you're already complaining! I've been worrying about you day and night, I finally found you such a wife, and you're still picky! If you miss this marriage, see where else you can find one!" Da Shui mumbled, "Doesn't know how to read, doesn't know how to work, awkward and twisted..." The old man interrupted, "Boy, you make do with it! Where can you find someone so pleasing? Look at me, my hair and beard are all white, and you're already in your twenties! While I'm still healthy, I'll take care of this big event for you; if you delay any longer, when will I not be able to catch my breath..." The old man couldn't go on. Da Shui was grateful and sad, and he didn't say anything more.
    Ai Heshang came to Da Shui to go to the team headquarters for a meeting, Da Shui said to his father, "Dad, I'll be back in a while, you have some food before you leave!" Da Shui came back very late, his father couldn't wait and had already left.

　　V
    On March 18th, Niu Xiao Shui came to find Da Shui with Hei Lao Cai's letter; the letter told Da Shui to go home immediately, there was something to talk about. Da Shui arranged his work a bit, carried a briefcase on one side and a box cannon on the other, and went back with Xiao Shui. On the way, Xiao Shui walked bouncing and jumping, deliberately looking at Da Shui and singing:
    Little kid, sitting on the doorstep,
    Crying and weeping, wanting a wife,
    What do you want a wife for?
    To light the lamp and talk,
    To blow out the lamp and be a companion…
    Da Shui said, "What are you being naughty for?" Xiao Shui made a face at him.
    As soon as Da Shui arrived home, he saw a red lantern hanging on the door, and red couplets pasted on both sides; the yard was full of people cooking dishes and steaming steamed buns, a chaotic mess. The old man grabbed him and smiled until he couldn't see his eyes, saying, "Boy, you're back! We've been waiting for you. Quick, go take a look at the new house!" and pulled Da Shui into the house.
    In the three narrow adobe rooms, the western one, where there used to be pitchforks, brooms, plows and rakes, had long been cleared away, and the room had been swept clean. A borrowed blanket was spread on the kang; two quilts were neatly folded on one side, and there was also a pair of new pillows. Red "囍" characters were pasted on the wall, and pictures of beautiful women sent by people were hung up. Opposite the kang was a borrowed table and two chairs. Paper horses, incense ingots, and a pair of red candles were placed on the table. The old man boasted, "Look! I've arranged this, and taken care of that, everything is ready."
    Da Shui asked anxiously, "Where's my cousin? To get married, we have to talk to the higher-ups and go through the procedures!" The old man laughed hahaha when he heard this, saying, "No need for you to worry about it! Your cousin has already taken care of it for you." Just as he was saying this, suddenly those uncles, aunts, and grandmothers all crowded in, shouting, "The new son-in-law is looking at the room! The new son-in-law is looking at the room!" The old man hurriedly pushed Da Shui onto the kang to stand. Two drummers who came to help, entered playing their instruments in a mi li ma la fashion and circled around the new room, then played and left. (To be continued)

　　新儿女英雄传
    袁静　孔厥
　　第五回　新女婿（续一）
    黑老蔡回来以后，张金龙在屋里悄悄跟他说了半天话。黑老蔡很高兴，又是安慰他，又是鼓励他。临了，张金龙解下扎腿带儿，从袜筒里掏出一小包烟土，交给黑老蔡说：“我早就知道这个事儿不对劲！姊夫，你早来我早交给你啦。”小梅在门外边听呢，这时候笑盈盈的走进来，故意对黑老蔡说：“金龙还算是个明白人呢，人家叫他去，他就不去。”张金龙得意的夸口：“吓，没这点儿志气还行？叫我当汉奸，给我金子银子我也不去！谁要是跟日本人共事儿，谁是个大姑娘养的！”
    三个人闲谈了一会儿。黑老蔡瞅个机会，又对小梅悄悄儿嘱咐说：“金龙正在岔道口呢，你得好好儿影响他。这人枪头子准，也有些本事，最好争取他出来工作，别叫汉奸把他拉跑了！”小梅应着。黑老蔡就带了老婆孩子，跟张金龙一家告辞，回去了。 　　二
    小梅在家住的几天，一方面对张金龙生活上照顾得挺周到，一方面黑间白日的劝说他，争取他出来工作。
    初六，小梅要走了；头天晚上，临睡，她跟金龙说：“你怎么着？要走，明儿跟我一块儿走吧。”张金龙坐在被窝里，抽着烟卷儿，不言声。小梅说：“我也工作，你也工作，咱两个一块儿进步，有多好啊！”金龙说：“你也走了，我也走了，丢下老人怎么着？”小梅笑着说：“咳，得了吧！你在家里能干个什么呀？出去了，村里倒能给些优待呢。”
    张金龙扔了烟头，脱下袄儿，缩进被窝里，嘻皮笑脸的说：“半夜三更，口枯眼涩的，咱俩睡吧；别尽直跟我说这个了！出去不出去，咱们以后再说。”小梅指着他：“你这个人，真是！还这么磨磨游游的。老在家里浪里浪荡，都把你浪荡坏了！工农兵学商，你算哪一行？你出去抗日，我也光彩；你在家里鬼混，我都替你害臊。你要再这么没出息，咱俩就过不到一块儿！”张金龙说：“唉！你死求百赖的叫我出去，出去干什么呀？”小梅说：“你耍了这么些年的枪杆儿，枪头子也挺准；打日本你比我还吃香呢，你还不去参军？”
    张金龙一听参军，就和小梅谈崩了。他翻过身去，坚决的说：“我不去！八路军生活苦，谁受得了！”小梅说得口干舌焦，他可说：“反正人是个混水鱼，混到哪儿是哪儿。你不用管我！”
    小梅看他实在没出息？心里也烦了，生气的站起来说：“好吧，咱们别说了！我看你还是去当你的汉奸好；闹个吃喝嫖赌，昧了良心，丢了人都不要紧！”张金龙火了，猛的坐起来：“你说什么！谁当汉奸去？你别拿狗屎往人脸上抹！”小梅不理他，把自个儿的枕头搬到另一头，吹了灯，脱下衣裳就睡。张金龙也气愤愤的躺下了。
    两个人一个头朝东，一个头朝西，僵了半天。张金龙憋不住，把自己的枕头也搬过去，老着脸皮儿，笑嘻嘻的说：“你看你这个人，有话慢慢儿说嘛，着急什么！”小梅说：“我跟你说的都是好话。人要向远处看，亮处走。八路军苦是苦些，就是正正道道的叫人学好。你看我才工作了几天，懂的事儿也多了，看个信、开个条儿，也能对付；你男子汉大丈夫，连个字也不识，还不如我呢。要是你参加了，好好儿干，文能文，武能武，一年比一年进步，可有个出息，可有个干头呢。”张金龙调皮的说：“我就怕走远了，舍不得你呀！”小梅说：“别开玩笑，咱们说正经的。你要真的怕走远，咱们问问老蔡，看能不能在县大队上找个事儿。”张金龙笑着说：“这还不行？要是你早说这个，我早就愿意啦。”
    第二天，金龙也没跟老人说，就和小梅一块儿，到区上找黑老蔡去了。
    三
    牛大水也在区上，正和黑老蔡谈问题呢。何世雄跑的第二天，申耀宗也偷跑了。有人看见，前一天何狗皮到申耀宗家去过，鬼鬼祟祟的不知谈了些什么。大水说：“狐狸和獾通气着呢，准是何世雄把他勾走了。”黑老蔡点头说：“有可能是何世雄欺骗宣传，把他鼓动走的。你们可不要为难他的家庭，以后我们还争取他回来。”
    县委书记程平来了，跟黑老蔡谈了一会话。老蔡对大水说：“最近干部里头有些调动。你回去跟双喜说，叫他马上到区上来工作；中心村的村长你给当上……”大水抢着说：“啊呀！我那个中队长怎么着？”黑老蔡笑着说：“你别忙嘛！中队长就叫高屯儿当；你捎搭兼个中队附。”程平在旁边嘱咐：“双喜走了，支部书记你们另选一个吧。”大水说：“行喽行喽。”
    谈了一会儿，大水就出来，想到南屋找助理员，领粮票菜金；在院子里劈面碰见小梅抱着孩子，后面跟的张金龙，夹着个铺盖卷儿，往北屋走。大水不好意思招呼，就跑进南屋去了。粮秣助理员谷子春正在忙着打算盘呢，大水在一边等着，听见北屋里说得怪热闹，可不知道谈些什么；心里想：“怎么张金龙这小子还不扣起来呀？”他拿了粮票菜金出来，刚好又碰见小梅他三口子往外走。
    张金龙笑着点头：“大水，你忙啊？”大水慌乱的说：“哦——呃，你往哪儿去？”张金龙兴头头的说：“已经说好了，我到县大队去工作。”说着，三口子走出大门，大水很生气的跑去问黑老蔡这：“是怎么回事？张金龙这样的汉奸嫌疑，也给他工作？”老蔡把张金龙转变的情形告诉他，大水才明白；也说不出是高兴，还是气闷，回中心村去了。
    四
    牛大水当中心村长，又当中队附，工作更忙啦。上级几次指出，还得抓紧学习，才能把工作作好。大水和高屯儿几个，抽空就跟小学校周老师学习，进步倒很快。
    有一天，大水拿着一张报纸，正在用手指头点着，一个字一个字的大声念呢。他爹来看他；一见面，老头儿就喜眉笑眼的说：“小子，我可给你找下好媳妇啦。是斜柳村的，姓朱，叫翠花儿，才十八岁，可是个好闺女哩！准投你的缘，对你的劲儿。”大水让老爹坐了，对他说：“这样的年头，自个儿肚子还对付不了，还娶得起媳妇？”老爹喜气洋洋的说：“你不知道，我这几年省吃俭用，一个子儿也舍不得花，给你积攒了几个钱；碰到这个年头儿，人家也困难，不图这，不图那，就图你是个八路军干部，人品好。这也花不了什么钱。反正你什么也不用操心，都有我呢。”老爹嘻着没牙的嘴，乐呵呵的笑。
    大水放好报纸，问：“她识字咧不？”老爹愣住了，说：“啊呀，这我倒没问！大半儿不识字。嗨，庄户人家妇女，识那字儿干什么呀？”大水就不满意的说：“不识字的，我不要！”气得老爹撅起胡子，指着他说：“你才识了几个狗爪子字呀，就嫌人家！我为你黑间白日的操心，好容易找下这么个媳妇，你还挑三嫌四的！错过这门亲事，看你还哪儿找去！”大水嘟嘟囔囔的说：“又不识字，又不会工作，蹩蹩扭扭的……”老爹抢着说：“小子，你将就点吧！哪儿找那么可心可意的呀？你看我，头发胡子都白了，你也二十几了！趁我还健，给你了了这件大事；要再耽搁下去，多会儿我一口气上不来的时候……”老爹说不下去了。大水又感激，又难过，也就不啃气了。
    艾和尚来找大水到队部开会去，大水对老爹说：“爹，我一会儿就回来，你吃了饭再走吧！”大水回来得很迟，老爹等不及，已经回去了。
    五
    三月十八，牛小水拿着黑老蔡的信，来找大水；信上叫大水马上回家，有话说。大水把工作安顿了一下，一边挎个公文包，一边挎个盒子枪，和小水一块儿回去。路上，小水蹦蹦跳跳的走着，故意瞅着大水唱：
    小小子儿，坐门墩儿，
    哭哭啼啼，要媳妇儿，
    要媳妇儿干什么？
    点灯，说话儿，
    吹灯，作伴儿……
    大水说：“你顽皮什么？”水小对他作了个鬼脸儿。
    大水一到家，就看见门上吊个红灯笼，两边贴着红对联；院里又是作菜的，又是蒸饽饽的，乱乱腾腾好些人。老爹一把拉住他，笑得没眼儿了，说：“小子，你回来啦！单等着你呢。快到新房里瞧瞧！”就把大水拉到屋里去。
    三间窄巴巴的土坯房，西边的一间，原来那些杈把扫帚，犁杖竿子耙，早拿开了，屋里打扫得干干净净的。炕上铺一条借来的毯子；两条被子整整齐齐的叠在一边，还有一对新枕头。墙上贴着红?字，挂着人家送的美人儿书。炕对面是借来的一张桌子和两把椅子。桌上放着纸马香锞和一对红蜡。老爹夸着说：“你看！我张罗了这宗，又打点那项，什么都齐备啦。”
    大水着急的问：“表哥在哪儿？要结婚，也得和上级说说，办个手续呀！”老爹听了，哈哈哈的大笑，说：“还用你操心！你表哥早给你办妥啦。”正说着，忽然那些叔叔大伯、婶子大娘，都拥进来了；喊着：“新女婿相房啦！新女婿相房啦！”老爹急忙把大水推到炕上站着。两个来帮忙的吹鼓手，就咪哩嘛啦的吹打着进来，在新房里绕了一个圈儿，又吹打着出去了。（未完）
