Xinhua News Agency, Peiping, 3rd—While the Foreign Ministers' Conference is being held in Paris, the Anglo-American authorities are continuing their practical steps outside the conference to divide Germany. According to various reports: During the Foreign Ministers' Conference (20th to 26th), the International Authority for the Ruhr, established according to the agreement of the second separate London conference in December last year, held a series of expected negotiations in London to discuss issues related to the authority's procedures and administrative nature, such as the organization of the secretariat, staffing, and the authority's rules of procedure.

On the 1st, the US, British, and French governors also approved the election law of their puppet organization—the Bonn Parliamentary Council. Elections to divide Germany will be held as soon as the state premiers determine the date.

At the same time, following the governments of the United States and France, the British government has also appointed its military governor in Germany, Robertson, as the first High Commissioner to Germany. The United States has appointed McCloy, and France has appointed Poncet, as their respective High Commissioners to Germany. The High Commission stipulated in the "Occupation Statute" will soon be established to replace the Allied Control Council as the highest control organ for the long-term occupation of West Germany.

These activities prove that the Anglo-American group has so far no sincerity in resolving the German issue, thereby establishing a peaceful solution for Europe and the world. Acheson, the US representative, sent a letter to the Senate Democratic leader on the 28th of last month, requesting the speedy ratification of the aggressive North Atlantic Treaty and the comprehensive military foreign aid bill, which also vividly illustrates the Anglo-American group's lack of sincerity in resolving problems peacefully.

　　美英集团和平无诚意
  　外长会议时继续分裂德国
    【新华社北平三日电】当此外长会议正在巴黎开会的时候，美英法当局在会外分裂德国的实际步骤仍继续进行中。据各方报道：就在外长会议开会期间（二十至二十六日），依照去年十二月第二次单独的伦敦会议协议决定成立的鲁尔国际管制局，在伦敦举行了一系列的预期谈判，讨论该局有关程序和管理性质问题，如秘书处组织、人员配备及该局程序规则等。
    一日，美英法总督并已批准其傀儡组织——波恩议会委员会的选举法。一俟各州总理确定日期，即将进行分裂德国的选举。
    与此同时，英国政府继美法两国政府之后，亦已委任其驻德军事总督罗伯逊为第一任驻德高级专员。美国已任命麦克洛埃，法国已任命庞赛，为各该国驻德高级专员。“占领法规”中所规定的高级委员会，即将成立，以代替盟国管制委员会，作为长期占领西德的最高管制机关。
    这些活动，证明了美英集团迄今并无诚意解决德国问题，从而确立欧洲与全世界的和平解决。美代表艾奇逊上月二十八日致函参院民主党领袖，请求从速批准侵略性的北大西洋公约，及全面军事援外法案一事，也生动地说明了美英集团缺乏和平解决问题的诚意。
