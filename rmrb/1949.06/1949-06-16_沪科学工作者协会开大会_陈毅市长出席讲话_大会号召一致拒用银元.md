Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 15th: The Shanghai Scientific Workers Association held a membership meeting at the Academia Sinica on the afternoon of the 12th. Over 150 people attended, including Wu Juenong, Zhu Kezhen, Mao Yisheng, and Lü Jiong. Mayor Chen Yi and Xia Yan, Deputy Director of the Cultural and Educational Management Committee, were also invited to attend. Before the meeting, a memorial service was held for Zhong Quanzhou, a member of the association. (Note: Zhong Quanzhou was a maintenance worker at the Shanghai Jiaotong Automobile Company's maintenance depot. He was killed by the bandit Tang Enbo on February 17th of this year for leading the automobile company's strike.) After the opening of the meeting, Chairman Qiu Weiyu delivered a speech, calling on scientific workers to strive for the construction of a new China. Then Zhang Mengwen gave a report on the association's affairs.

Mayor Chen Yi and Deputy Director Xia Yan were successively invited to speak. In his speech, Mayor Chen Yi expressed his hope that Shanghai's scientific workers would work together to build a new China in the future. At the same time, he pointed out the past tendencies of some scientific workers who believed that science belonged only to a few people, and therefore were aloof and detached from the people, as well as the separation of science and politics, believing that science had nothing to do with politics. He said that scientific workers must have a progressive outlook on life, a progressive worldview, and a correct political mind in order to achieve greater success. The liberation of Shanghai and the liberation of China are the liberation of science and the liberation of scientific workers. The Chinese Communist Party will not only not interfere with scientific workers who serve the people, but will also protect and support them. The Communist Party is willing to unite with scientific workers and strive together for the construction of a new China. Then, Wu Juenong, on behalf of the理事会 (Board of Directors/Council), called on members to carry out self-education and self-criticism, study the theory of New Democracy, and get closer to the working class, actively study ways to reduce production costs and improve product quality, and earnestly participate in the work of building a new China. Finally, the congress passed a resolution requesting to join the Shanghai Federation of Trade Unions, and supporting the People's Government's measures to ban silver dollars, calling on scientific workers to assist the government in stabilizing finance and unanimously reject the use of silver dollars.

　　沪科学工作者协会开大会
  　陈毅市长出席讲话
  　大会号召一致拒用银元
    【新华社上海十五日电】上海科学工作者协会十二日下午在中央研究院召开会员大会。到会吴觉农、竺可桢、茅以升、吕炯等一百五十余人。陈毅市长、文化教育管理委员会副主任夏衍，也应邀参加。开会前，举行该会会员钟泉周追悼会。（按：钟泉周是上海交通汽车公司保养场工务员，因领导汽车公司罢工，今年二月十七日被汤匪恩伯杀害。）开会后，主席裘维裕致词，号召科学工作者为建设新中国而努力。接着由张孟闻作会务报告。
    陈毅市长、夏衍副主任先后被邀讲话。陈市长在讲话中希望上海科学工作者今后共同努力建设新中国，同时指出了过去有些科学工作者认为科学只是属于少数人的，因此孤高自傲脱离人民，以及把科学和政治分割开来，认为科学和政治无关的偏向。他说，科学工作者必须有进步的人生观、进步的宇宙观和正确的政治头脑，才能有更大的成就。上海的解放，中国的解放，就是科学的解放，就是科学工作者的解放。中国共产党对于为人民服务的科学工作者，不但不加干涉，而且加以保护和扶持。共产党愿意和科学工作者团结一起，共同为建设新中国而奋斗。接着吴觉农代表理事会号召会员们实行自我教育和自我批评，学习新民主主义的理论，并和劳动阶级靠拢，积极研究减低生产成本、提高产品质量的办法，切实地参加建设新中国的工作。最后大会通过决议，请求参加上海职工会，并拥护人民政府取缔银元的措施，号召科学工作者协助政府安定金融，一致拒用银元。
