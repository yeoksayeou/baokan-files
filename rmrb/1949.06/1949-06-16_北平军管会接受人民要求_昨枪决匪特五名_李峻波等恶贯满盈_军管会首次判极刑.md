【Ping City News】The Military Law Department of the Beiping Military Control Commission, accepting the just demands of the people, based on the investigation results and public prosecution of the Public Security Bureau of the Ping Municipal People's Government, held a military trial and sentenced to death five Kuomintang special agents and bandits, Li Junbo, Ye Zhimao, Li Keqin, Cheng Zhuqing, and Xin Wei, who disturbed the people, murdered revolutionary cadres, and seriously disrupted revolutionary order. They were executed by firing squad at 4:00 PM on June 15th. This is the first time the Municipal Military Control Commission has executed bandits and robbers. Accessories to the cases, except for those who were coerced and released after education, were sentenced to various terms of imprisonment, including Qu Yuan, Ren Jianxun, Yang Xiaofeng, Jiang Hongxun, and Yang Peiji.

	Li Junbo was originally the chief of the internal affairs section of the Peiping Special Commissioner's Office of the puppet Gendarmerie Headquarters and a member of the puppet Hebei People's Self-Salvation Pioneer Team. Under the instructions of Li Xiaoran, the chief of the special high team of the 19th puppet Gendarmerie Regiment, he was lurking in the city. Together with Ye Zhimao, the platoon leader of the puppet artillery, he gathered Qu Yuan, the squad leader of the 19th puppet Gendarmerie Regiment, Ren Jianxun, the inspector of the puppet Tangshan Police Bureau, Yang Xiaofeng, a rogue businessman, Jiang Hongxun, an intelligence and communications officer of the Peiping Special Commissioner's Office of the puppet Gendarmerie Headquarters, and Yang Peiji, a liaison officer of the Peiping Special Commissioner's Office of the puppet Gendarmerie Headquarters. From December 8th of last year to March 8th of this year, they repeatedly carried out armed robberies in eight locations in the city, including Xiheyan, Saozhou Hutong, Tonglin Pavilion Road, Shihou Street, Nanchi, Jiaodaokou, Xinkai Road, Fuyou Street, and Kuitouzuo. They tied up, hung up, and brutally abused the victims, and also disturbed the area under the guise of the Urban Work Department of the CPC Committee of the Ji-Re-Cha Region and the Public Security Bureau of the People's Government. After investigation by the Municipal Public Security Bureau, they were all arrested on March 8th, and two pistols and eleven rounds of ammunition were seized on the spot.

	Li Keqin was originally a special agent of the Political Work Office of the 1st Regiment of the puppet 208th Division. Born into a landlord rogue family, he consistently hated the Communist Party and the People's Liberation Army. After the liberation of Tangshan, Li immediately sneaked into his home in Beiping. Because he had previously known Dong Junling, a working cadre of the Scattered Military Personnel Handling Committee of the Beiping Garrison Command, Dong had repeatedly persuaded Li to atone for his crimes. Li Keqin not only refused to repent but also assassinated Dong in the Shuanghezai Sanxiandong in the Old Summer Palace on the afternoon of March 10th and robbed his pistol and bullets. This was discovered by the Sixth Branch of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, and the murderer Li Keqin was arrested on April 3rd. Li Keqin's stolen pistol and twelve bullets were found in the Cao residence (No. 19, Gongmen Koutou Tiao, Inner Fourth District), a relative of Li.

	Cheng Zhuqing was originally the commander of the 1st Detachment of the Independent 1st Column of the puppet Ministry of National Defense. After the liberation of Beiping, he falsely claimed to be the chief of staff of the People's Government. He gathered 48 people, including Liu Wengui, the deputy battalion commander of the Independent Regiment of the 5th Column of the puppet Baoding Pacification Headquarters, Wang Wenhan, a rogue businessman, Jin Baofeng, a thief, Pan Ruchuan, a puppet railway soldier, and Liu Deli, a brothel owner. They forged the seal of the Beiping Municipal People's Government and more than ten stamps such as the fake "Secret Investigation General Group", fabricated letters of appointment, passes, cadre lists, plans, intelligence, weapons, receipts, and other documents, and secretly organized the "Beiping Municipal People's Government Secret Investigation General Group". Cheng Zhuqing called himself the commander-in-chief, and appointed Liu Wengui as the fake head of the general group, Wang Wenhan as the fake political director, Jin Baofeng as the head of the first group, and Pan Ruchuan as the transmission chief. They robbed the people of weapons everywhere, and used armed intimidation to abuse the masses, defraud twelve cars, disrupt social order, endanger the safety of people's lives and property, and damage the reputation of the People's Government. After being discovered by the Discipline Inspection General Team, they were all arrested on February 25th, and many forged seals and documents were seized on the spot.

	Xin Wei was originally the captain of the political work brigade of the puppet Bureau of Confidentiality and the leader of the second group of the North China Directly Subordinate Intelligence Group of the puppet Political Work Bureau. Before liberation, he relied on his power to do evil and extort the people, and arrested and persecuted citizens under the name of "collaborating with bandits." In the 36th year of the Republic (1947), he was captured by the People's Liberation Army, and the People's Liberation Army released him after education in accordance with its lenient policy. Not only did the criminal not know how to repent, but he dared to gather more than 30 bandits after the liberation of Pingjin, and plotted to organize the "People's Liberation Army Pingjin Front Command Anti-Traitor Group". He forged seals and the Tianjin Municipal People's Government seal, and the private seal of Zhang Youyu, the former deputy mayor of Tianjin, and other fake certificates. He impersonated the People's Liberation Army, extorted people's property, defrauded three pistols and 35 bullets, and attempted to expand his special agent organization and carry out sabotage activities, damaging the reputation of the People's Liberation Army and the People's Government. After being discovered by the Public Security Bureau, they were all arrested on February 24th, and their forged seals and documents were seized on the spot.

	These special agents and bandits had committed many evils before liberation. Although the People's Government gave them lenient treatment after liberation, urging them to consciously repent, these criminals remained obstinate and unrepentant. They ignored the path of registration and self-renewal, continued to engage in special agent sabotage activities, or harmed revolutionary cadres, or gathered people to carry out armed robbery, resolutely hostile to the people, thinking that the People's Government's lenient policy could become a protective talisman for them to disturb the people. In order to implement the protection of the safety of the people's lives and property and maintain revolutionary order, the People's Government has specially sentenced these heinous bandits to death to serve as a warning to others and to quell public anger.

	The People's Government, considering that other participants in special agent organizations were mostly deceived or coerced to participate, and still knew how to repent after being arrested, still gave them the opportunity to reform in the spirit of the People's Government's leniency and dealt with them leniently. Among them, those with more serious crimes: Qu Yuan in the Ye case was sentenced to five years of fixed-term imprisonment; Ren Jianxun and Yang Xiaofeng were each sentenced to three years of fixed-term imprisonment; Jiang Hongxun was sentenced to two years of fixed-term imprisonment; Yang Peiji was sentenced to one year of fixed-term imprisonment; Wang Wenhan in the Cheng case was sentenced to one year and six months of fixed-term imprisonment; Jin Baofeng, Pan Ruchuan, and Liu Deli were each sentenced to six months of fixed-term imprisonment. The rest were all of a coerced nature and mostly first-time offenders. Although they were illegal, they were still able to confess and repent. In order to give them a path to self-renewal, the People's Government released them after education and did not pursue them.

　　北平军管会接受人民要求
  　昨枪决匪特五名
    李峻波等恶贯满盈
  　军管会首次判极刑
    【平市讯】北平市军事管制委员会军法处，接受人民正义要求，根据平市人民政府公安局的侦察结果与公诉，对扰害人民，杀害革命干部，严重破坏革命秩序的国民党特务匪徒李峻波、叶志茂、李克勤、程祝青、辛维等五名，举行了军事审判并判处了死刑，于六月十五日下午四时执行枪决。此为本市军管会第一次枪决匪犯抢犯，对各案从犯，除胁从分子经过教育后释放外，并对曲源、任建勋、杨晓峰，姜鸿勋、杨培基等分处各等有期徒刑。
    李峻波原为伪宪兵司令部驻平特派员办公处内勤组长，伪河北人民自救先锋队队员，受伪宪兵十九团特高组长李筱然指使，潜伏本市，与伪炮兵排长叶志茂为首，聚结伪宪兵十九团班长曲源、伪唐山警局督察任建勋、流氓商人杨晓峰、伪宪兵司令部驻平特派员办公处情报通讯员姜鸿勋、伪宪兵司令部驻平特派员办公处联络干事杨培基等，自去年十二月八日至本年三月八日连续在本市西河沿、扫帚胡同、佟麟阁路、石猴街、南池子、交道口、新开路、府右街、盔头作等八处屡次实行武装抢劫，并对事主捆绑吊打，残害虐待，且冒充冀热察区中共党委城市工作部及人民政府公安局等名义到处滋扰。经市公安局侦知，于三月八日将其全部逮捕，当场搜获手枪两支，子弹十一发。
    李克勤原为国民党伪二○八师一团政工室特务，地主流氓出身，一贯仇视共产党与人民解放军，唐山解放后，李即潜来北平家中，因与本市警备司令部流散军人处理委员会工作干部董峻岭已往相识，董曾再三劝李立功赎罪，李克勤非但不肯悔改，且于三月十日下午在圆明园故址双鹤斋三仙洞内将董暗杀，并劫走手枪及子弹，事为市公安局郊六分局侦悉，于四月三日将凶手李克勤逮捕，并在李的亲戚曹宅（住内四区宫门口头条十九号）起出李克勤所劫董之手枪一支、子弹十二粒。
    程祝青原为伪国防部独立第一纵队第一支队司令。北平解放后，伪称为人民政府参谋长，聚结伪保定绥署第五纵队独立团副营长刘文贵、流氓商人王文翰、小偷金宝峰、伪铁道兵潘如川、妓院老板刘德利等四十八人，伪制北平市人民政府印信及伪“秘查总组”等图章十余颗，假造委任状、通行证、干部名单、计划书、情报、武器、单据等文件，秘密组织“北平市人民政府秘查总组”，程祝青自称总司令，并以刘文贵为伪总组长，王文翰为伪政治主任，金宝峰为第一分组长，潘如川为传达长，到处劫取人民武器，并以武装威吓虐害群众，诈取汽车十二辆，扰乱社会秩序，危害人民生命财产之安全，并破坏人民政府声誉，经纠察总队侦悉后，于二月二十五日将其全部逮捕，当场搜获假造印信文件甚多。
    辛维原为伪保密局政工大队长，伪政工局华北直辖情报组第二组组长，解放前即仗势作恶，敲诈人民，并以“通匪”名义拘捕残害市民。三十六年，曾被解放军俘虏，解放军本宽大政策予以教育释放，该犯不但不知反省，竟敢于平津解放后，集结匪徒三十余名，主谋组织“人民解放军平津前线司令部除奸组”，假造戳记及天津市人民政府印信、前天津市副市长张友渔私章等，伪造证明书，冒充人民解放军，勒索人民财物，骗取手枪三支，子弹三十五发，并企图扩展其特务组织，进行破坏活动，损害解放军及人民政府声誉，经公安局侦悉，于二月二十四日，将其全部逮捕，并将其假造印信及文件当场搜获。
    这些特务匪徒在解放前就作恶多端，解放后人民政府虽给予以宽大待遇，促使其自觉悔悟，但该犯等仍执迷不悟，且怙恶不悛，对登记自新之路，置之不顾，或继续作特务破坏活动，或残害革命干部，或聚众实行武装抢劫，坚决与人民为敌，以为人民政府之宽大政策可以成为纵任彼等扰害人民之护身符。人民政府为贯彻保护人民生命财产安全，维持革命秩序起见，特将这些罪大恶极的匪徒判处死刑，以儆效尤，而平公愤。
    人民政府对于其他参加特务组织者，念其多系受骗，或被胁参加，被捕后又尚知悔过，仍本人民政府宽大精神，给予改造机会，从轻处理。其中罪行较重大者：叶案中的曲源，处有期徒刑五年；任建勋、杨晓峰各处有期徒刑三年；姜鸿勋处有期徒刑二年；杨培基处有期徒刑一年；程案中的王文翰处有期徒刑一年零六个月；金宝峰、潘如川、刘德利各处有期徒刑六个月。其余均为胁从性质，且多属初犯，虽属违法，尚能坦白悔过，人民政府为给予自新之路，经过教育释放，不予追究。
