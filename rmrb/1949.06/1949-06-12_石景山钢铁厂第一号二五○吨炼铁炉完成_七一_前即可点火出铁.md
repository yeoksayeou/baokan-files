　　First 250-ton Iron Furnace of Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant Completed
　　Iron Production to Begin Before July 1st
    [This newspaper reports] The first 250-ton iron furnace of the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant has been completed by all employees in advance at the end of May after four months of hard work. Excluding the time wasted in February waiting for refractory clay and other materials and tools, it actually only took more than three months. Currently, more than 10,000 tons of raw materials such as iron ore and limestone have been transported, enough for two months, and more can be continuously supplied in the future. The furnace baking began on June 1st, and it is estimated that iron production can begin before July 1st.
    So far, the entire restoration project of the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant and its scope have greatly exceeded the period of Kuomintang rule. Many projects that the Kuomintang could not complete or dared not start have been completed or are under construction by us. For example, the hundreds of tons of accumulated iron slag in the second 380-ton iron furnace, which the Kuomintang did not dare to touch, has now been dug to the bottom and is about to be redesigned. Two pipe casting machines in the foundry have also been repaired and will be able to cast pipes in the middle of the month. The newly built light oil refinery is now half completed. The second regenerative coke oven has been under construction for a month, and the third reservoir project has completed all the cement embankments and is now carrying out the foundation work. Other miscellaneous projects will continue to be carried out, so the number of workers in the whole plant is increasing day by day. Although there are still many difficulties in improving and developing production, such as manpower, materials, institutions, personnel...etc., that need to be solved, after the North China Iron and Steel Conference determined the production plan for the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant this year and the five-year transformation and development plan, all the workers and engineers in the plant are working confidently for this beautiful future.

### 石景山钢铁厂第一号二五○吨炼铁炉完成　“七一”前即可点火出铁

　　石景山钢铁厂第一号二五○吨炼铁炉完成
  　“七一”前即可点火出铁
    【本报讯】石景山钢铁厂第一号二百五十吨炼铁炉经全体职工四个月的努力，已于五月底提前完成。除去二月中等待耐火土等材料工具浪费的时间外，实际上只三个多月。现铁矿、石炭石等原料已各运到万余吨，足够两个月之用，且今后仍能源源而来。已于六月一日起开始烤炉，估计不到“七一”即可点火出铁。
    至此，石景山钢铁厂的全部修复工程及其范围，已大大超出了国民党统治时期。许多国民党所不能完成的，或不敢动工的工程，我们已完成，或正在修建，如第二号三百八十吨炼铁炉内的数百吨积铁矿渣，向为国民党所不敢动手，现已挖到底层，即将设计图样重新改建。铸造厂两架铸管机也已修好，月中即可铸管。新建的轻油精炼厂现已完成一半。第二号蓄热式炼焦炉已继续砌炉一个月，第三号蓄水池工程，已修好全部洋灰堤岸，正作打底工程。其他的零星工程，仍将继续进行，因此全厂工人日益增加。虽然目前改进与发展生产中尚有许多困难，如人力、物力、机构人事……等问题尚待解决，但自华北钢铁会议定出石景山钢铁厂本年生产计划与五年改造发展计划后，全厂工友和工程师正在为这个美丽的前途而有信心地工作着。　　　　（炽）
