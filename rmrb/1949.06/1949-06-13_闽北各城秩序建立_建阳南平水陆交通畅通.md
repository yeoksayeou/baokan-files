Xinhua News Agency, Northern Fujian Front, 12th: Order has been rapidly established in the various cities and towns of Northern Fujian that have been liberated one after another. Long-distance buses from Jianyang to Jian'ou and Nanping, and merchant ships from Jianyang to Nanping have begun selling tickets. Postal and telecommunications between counties are also open. People's governments at all levels have either been established or are in the process of being established. Jian'ou, the former base of the enemy's air force with a population of 50,000, had its power plant operating as usual on the day of liberation (May 12th). All of the city's more than 800 stores resumed business within three days of liberation. Prices have remained stable since liberation. All sixteen middle and primary schools in the city have resumed classes. In Jianyang, another transportation hub in northern Fujian and the former site of the Fujian Provincial Third Special Commissioner's Office, 90% of the stores were looted by fleeing bandits. After liberation, the stores transported goods that had been hidden in the countryside during the bandits' looting back to resume business. The former Fujian Provincial Highway employees are actively repairing the Jiǔqǔ Bridge (located 100 miles north of Jianyang city), the largest bridge in northern Fujian which had been damaged by bandits. In addition, nine other highway bridges are also under construction.

　　闽北各城秩序建立
  　建阳南平水陆交通畅通
    【新华社闽北前线十二日电】先后解放的闽北各城镇秩序均已迅速建立。建阳通建瓯、南平的长途汽车和建阳至南平的商船已开始售票，各县间的邮电交通亦已畅通，各级人民政府或已成立或正在成立中。拥有五万人口的前敌空军根据地建瓯，在解放的当天（五月十二日）电厂就照常送电，全城八百余家商店，在解放后三日内全部恢复了营业。解放以来物价稳定。该城的十六所中、小学已全部复课。闽北另一交通中心原福建伪三专员公署所在地建阳，百分之九十的商店遭受了南逃匪军的抢劫，解放后，各商店纷纷把匪军抢劫时移藏乡间的货物运回，恢复营业。原福建省公路员工，则正积极修复被匪军破坏的闽北第一大桥九曲桥（建阳城北百里）。另外九座公路桥梁也正分别修建中。
