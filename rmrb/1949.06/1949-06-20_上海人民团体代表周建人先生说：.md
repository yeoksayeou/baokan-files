　　Mr. Zhou Jianren, representative of Shanghai people's organizations, said:
    The new Political Consultative Conference was produced after the CCP issued its "May 1st" call. It was produced through unity. This is because the revolution led by the CCP against imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism is the common demand of the people and a path for the Chinese people's lives. Therefore, a united new Political Consultative Conference was inevitably produced to negotiate and formulate a new political program.
    Secondly, although the reactionary forces of the Kuomintang have been basically eliminated, they still have some remnant forces. Imperialism will inevitably support them in continuing their counter-revolutionary actions. The new Political Consultative Conference can be more united, more consolidated, and better able to lead the people, and more thoroughly eliminate the imperialist forces and feudal remnants in China.

　　上海人民团体代表周建人先生说：
    新的政治协商会议，是在中共发出“五一”号召后产生的，是团结中产生的，这是由于中共领导的反帝反封建反官僚资本主义的革命是人民的共同的要求，是中国人民生活的一条道路。因此必然产生了团结一致的新的政治协商会议，协商制定新的政治纲领。
    其次，国民党反动派势力，虽然基本上已经消灭，但它还有一些残余势力，帝国主义必然加以扶助其继续进行反革命行动，新的政治协商会议，就能更团结、更巩固、更可以领导人民，更可以彻底消灭在中国的帝国主义势力，和封建的残余势力。
