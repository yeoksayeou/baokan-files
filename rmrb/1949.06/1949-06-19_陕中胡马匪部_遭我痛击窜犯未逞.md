　　Xinhua News Agency, Shaanxi Central Front, 18th: Since the Hu bandits in the Mei County and Zhouzhi areas and the Ma bandits in the Qian County and Xianyang areas suffered heavy losses, they have not dared to launch frontal attacks in recent days, and their attempts to flee in all directions have also been unsuccessful. On the morning of the 14th, a unit of the 12th Division of the 17th Army of the Hu bandits, from Dongjiangkou, about 100 miles south of Hu County, attempted to invade Jiali Village from the north. On the 15th, the 84th Division of the 69th Army of the Hu bandits once attempted to invade Dizaizhen, 30 miles south of Baqiao in the southeast of Xi'an. After the 65th Army and 38th Army of the Hu bandits sneaked into Zhouzhi, they split up and attempted to harass the east on the 16th. On the morning of the 15th, a regiment of the 82nd Army of the Ma bandits sneaked to Beitun Town, northwest of Jingyang, and on the 16th, they split up and attempted to invade Linjing Ferry and Xiushi Ferry from Qian Dongzhen and Zhao Cunzhen. The above-mentioned invading bandit troops were all repelled by our local guard troops, and the invading bandits fled to the Qinling Mountains and the Liquan Mountains. In the battle, a part of the Hu and Ma bandits were killed, wounded, and captured. One mortar, three 60 mortars, and nine light and heavy machine guns were seized.

  　遭我痛击窜犯未逞
    【新华社陕中前线十八日电】自胡匪于郿县、盩厔地区及马匪于乾县、咸阳地区迭遭重创后，连日以来已不敢再作正面进犯，其四出乱窜者亦均不得逞。十四日晨胡匪十七军十二师一部，自鄠县以南约百余里的东江口，向北窜犯贾里村。十五日胡匪六十九军八十四师一度窜犯西安东南坝桥以南三十里的狄寨镇。胡匪六十五军、三十八军窜入盩厔后，十六日曾分路向东窜扰。十五日晨马匪八十二军一个团窜至泾阳西北的北屯镇，十六日又分由阡东镇、赵村镇窜犯临泾渡、修石渡。上述进犯匪军，均被我各地警戒部队击退，犯匪分向秦岭山区及醴泉山区逃窜。在战斗中毙伤俘胡马匪各一部。缴获迫击炮一门、六○炮三门、轻重机枪九挺。
