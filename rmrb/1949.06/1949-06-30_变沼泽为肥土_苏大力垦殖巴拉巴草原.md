Xinhua News Agency, Beiping, June 28th: TASS, Novosibirsk: Land reclamation is underway in the Baraba Steppe (upper reaches of the Ob River), the center of Western Siberia, on a scale equal to several small European countries. Abundant and fertile fodder promotes the development of livestock breeding. During the Soviet era, hundreds of mechanized factories producing cheese, condensed milk, and other dairy products have already been established here. Most of the Baraba Steppe is swampy, which has hindered the proper utilization of fodder resources and the expansion of livestock breeding. The Ministry of Agriculture dispatched a special expedition to work there for three years. Scientists from the West Siberian Branch of the Soviet Academy of Sciences traversed thousands of kilometers while surveying the grassland and have now developed a land reclamation and drainage plan that will transform the Baraba Steppe into an important center for the creamery industry, livestock breeding, arable farming, fisheries, and forestry. Collective farm peasants are actively participating in the transformation of the grassland. Thousands of people are digging canals. By this autumn, 50,000 hectares of swamp will be converted into dry land.

  　苏大力垦殖巴拉巴草原
    【新华社北平二十八日电】塔斯社新西伯利亚讯：土地垦殖工作正在西部西伯利亚中心的巴拉巴草原（鄂毕河上游）进行，面积之大等于欧洲好几个小国。大量肥美的饲料，促使牲畜饲养业发展，在苏维埃时代，这里已经建立了几百个制造干酪、炼乳及其他乳品的机械化工厂。巴拉巴草原大部分是沼泽地，曾经阻碍了饲料富源的适当利用和牲畜饲养业的扩展。农业部曾派遣特别远征队在那里工作了三年之久。苏联科学院西部西伯利亚分会的科学家们在勘查草原时，曾跋涉了几千公里，现在已制出了土地垦殖和排水的计划，该计划将使巴拉巴草原变成奶油工业、牲畜饲养、农出耕作、渔业和造林的重要中心地带。集体农场的农民积极参加改造草原的工作。数以千计的人们正在挖掘运河。到今年秋天，将有五万公顷的沼泽地变成干地。
