【Jizhong Electric】The 8th Administrative Office of Jizhong is now mobilizing the masses to build dikes. The South Canal dike was completed on May 15th, and the Ziya River and Daqing River dikes are under construction. This project has mobilized laborers from sixteen counties and cities, and is being carried out in sections. Starting from Yangliuqing to Botou City, the total length is 270 li. Over 200,600 cubic meters of earthwork have been used, not including Qing County and Huanghua County. More than 131,200 trees have been planted on the river堤。 Generally, counties in the administrative area have established dike repair organizations. During the construction period, some counties closely combined dike repair with planting according to the early or late planting season. Cang County mobilized the masses to start construction early. By the time of planting, the first section had been completed. After planting, they concentrated on repairing dangerous sections. In Jianguo, the masses were first mobilized to rush to plant, and at the same time, dike repair organization and education were carried out. Now most of the laborers have begun to restore the dike. Kang Xifeng, Jia Guiying, and other three women in Botou City took the lead in organizing a dike-building team of eighty-three women, which persisted for eight consecutive days, equivalent to fifty male laborers. However, in some individual counties, the phenomenon of wasting laborers is still quite serious.
    【Another Dispatch】In order to build water conservancy projects and turn dry land into paddy fields, the 8th Administrative Office of Jizhong is now planning to build seven sluice gates on the South Canal, South Alkali River, and North Alkali River, install twenty-two water pipes, and dig four drainage canals. The 8th Administrative Office has instructed its subordinate counties to organize construction committees. The former 8th Office of the Jizhong Water Conservancy Bureau has now been changed to the 8th Administrative Area Irrigation Committee to strengthen leadership. Twenty-two cadres were drawn and combined with the Jizhong Survey Team, divided into four groups to conduct work in the counties. It is estimated that this project can irrigate 150,000 mu of land upon completion.
    【Taiyue Electric】Jiang County has achieved great success in water conservancy construction. All 28 villages in the county that met the conditions for construction started work one after another in early March. The county government and the bank sent cadres to participate in the leadership, and the bank provided 302 shi of grain as loans to support them. Before May 15th, 21 villages had basically completed the plan, including two newly opened canals, seven extended old canals, and twenty-six restored old canals. The total length of the canals is 84 li, which can irrigate 11,415.9 mu of land. In addition, seven waterwheels were erected (three newly installed and four repaired), which can irrigate 140 mu of land. The land irrigated by the canals can increase production by four shi dou; the land irrigated by wells can increase production by one shi, for a total increase of more than 5,500 shi of coarse grains.
    【Chahar News】Since the spring, there has been a drought and no rain. The Huolu County Party Committee has decided to strengthen water conservancy construction. First, consolidate the existing canals, strengthen management, and replenish water volume. Cui, the deputy county magistrate, and the director of the industrial section are specifically responsible for leading water conservancy. Each canal must have one person stationed regularly to grasp the situation in a timely manner. The county has three canals that have undergone democratic re-election of cadres and have been renovated. Deputy County Magistrate Cui is stationed to lead the canals. Since the water release during the Qingming Festival, 15,000 mu of wheat fields have been generally irrigated twice, and 12,149 mu of cotton have been planted. They have also helped other villages irrigate wheat and plant cotton, completing the task of irrigating 33,000 mu of land. Because the Second District Committee did not resolutely implement the county party committee's decision on the Yuanquan Canal, and the county leadership was also negligent, the canal was ditched twice during cotton planting and the water was stopped for five days, affecting the cotton planting of nine villages in the Second District. A special person has now been sent to rectify the situation. The first branch canal of the newly opened Shijin Canal began to release water on May 8th, and has now irrigated 3,500 mu of land.

    【Chahar News】Last autumn, the river water was vast, and many river滩lands were destroyed. This year, the government regards repairing滩lands as an important part of increasing production and called on the masses to quickly repair them. The masses in various villages responded enthusiastically and have been actively carrying out this work since the spring. It has now been completely repaired. Except for a small part of the land that is in poor condition and will be planted with rice during the flood season, most of the other parts have been planted with rice. A total of 1,590 mu of滩land have been repaired. This year, the average yield of rice per mu is 8 shi dou, which can increase production by 1,272 shi.

　　冀中发动群众大力防汛
  　南运河堤修复
  　太岳绛县修渠八十四里
    【冀中电】冀中第八专署现正发动群众修筑堤岸。南运河堤于五月十五日已修成，子牙河、大清河堤正在修筑。这一工程计动员了十六个县市的民工，分区进行。自杨柳青开始至泊头市，全长二百七十华里。动用了二十万零六千余土方，尚不包括青县、黄骅两县在内。并在河堤植树十三万一千二百余株。该专区一般县都成立了修堤组织。在修工期间，有的县份根据当地播种早迟情况，使修工与播种密切结合。沧县提早发动群众动手修筑，到播种时，已修完了第一段，播种完后，再突击修险工。建国则先发动群众突击播种，同时进行修堤的组织教育，现大部民工已开始复堤。泊镇市妇女康喜凤、贾桂荣等三人带头组织了八十三个妇女的打堤队，一连坚持八天，足顶五十个男工。但也有个别县份，浪费民工现象还相当严重。
    【又电】为兴修水利，变旱田为水田，冀中第八专署现正计划在南运河、南碱河、北碱河修闸七处，安设水管二十二处，挖筑泄水渠四处。八专署已指示所属县组织修筑委员会，原冀中水利局第八办事处，现已改为八专区灌溉委员会，以加强领导。抽出二十二个干部，结合冀中测量队，分为四组到县进行工作。预计此工程完成可浇地十五万亩。
    【太岳电】绛县兴修水利工作，已获很大成绩。全县有兴修条件的二十八个村已于三月初先后动工，县政府和银行，均派出干部参加领导，银行并以三百零二石贷粮扶持。五月十五日前，已有二十一个村大体完成计划，计新开水渠两条，延长旧渠七条，恢复旧渠二十六条。渠身总长八十四里，能浇地一万一千四百一十五亩九分。另又搭起水车七辆（新安三辆，修复四辆），可浇地一百四十亩。水渠地以增产四市斗；水井地以增产一市石计，共可增产粗粮五千五百余石。
    【察哈尔讯】入春以来天旱不雨，获鹿县委决定加强水利建设。首先巩固旧有渠道，加强管理充实水量，特责成崔副县长、实业科长专门领导水利，各渠道必须经常驻有一人及时掌握。该县计三渠经过民主改选干部，整修渠道，并由崔副县长驻渠领导。清明放水以来，一万五千亩麦田普浇二水，播种一万二千一百四十九亩大棉，并帮助别村浇麦种棉，完成浇地三万三千亩的任务。源泉渠因二区委没坚决执行县委决议，县领导上亦疏忽大意，使种棉中该渠即打壑两次停水五天，影响二区九个村的大棉播种，现已派专人前往整理。新开石津运河第一毛支渠，已于五月八日开始放水，现已浇地三千五百亩。（胡俊儒）
    【察哈尔讯】去秋河水浩大，沿河滩地冲毁不少，今年政府把修理滩地视作增产的一个重要环节，号召群众迅速修复，各村群众热烈响应，入春以来即积极进行这一工作，现已全部修毕，除一小部较坏之地待洪水季栽稻外，其他大部已种上稻子。修复滩地总共一五九○亩，每亩今年平均产稻八市斗，共可增产一千二百七十二石。
