  　Soviet Union Establishes Ministry of Urban Development; New Emerging Industrial Cities are Rapidly Increasing

　　Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 5th: Moscow dispatch: With the rapid recovery and development of industry after the war, Soviet cities are also continuously developing and increasing on a large scale. The Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union has issued an order to establish the All-Union Ministry of Urban Development in order to ensure national leadership in urban design and construction, carry out urban construction work in a planned manner, and apply advanced technologies in urban construction. The order also appointed Sokolov as the Minister of the All-Union Ministry of Urban Development and relieved him of his original position as Minister of the Construction and Road Machinery Industry.

　　Note: Since the October Revolution, in the 31 years since the founding of the Soviet Union, 839 new cities have been established. Among them, 475 were established during and after the Second World War. Many originally small residential areas have leaped to become emerging industrial cities. Some places that were only forest areas or had only narrow paths just two or three years ago have now been completely transformed and have become new cities connected by railway networks. According to pre-war statistics: After the Soviet Union began to enter the period of industrialization in 1926, in the short twelve years from 1927 to 1938, the total urban population of the Soviet Union increased from 26.3 million to 55.9 million, an increase of more than double.

　　有计划地建设城市
  　苏设城市发展部　新兴工业城市正大量增加中
    【新华社北平五日电】莫斯科讯：随着战后工业的迅速恢复和发展，苏联的城市也不断大规模地发展和增加。苏联最高苏维埃主席团特发布命令，成立全苏城市发展部，以便保证国家对城市设计与建设的领导，有计划地进行城市建设工作，并在城市建设中应用先进的技术。该项命令并任命梭科罗夫为全苏城市发展部部长，并解除他原来担任的建筑与筑路机器工业部部长的职务。
    按：自从十月革命后，苏联建国三十一年以来，已经建立了八百三十九座新城市。其中有四百七十五座是第二次大战期间和战后建立的。许多原来的小小居民区，都已一跃而成为新兴工业城市，有些仅在两三年前还只是森林区或只有羊肠小路的地方，现在也已经面貌一新，成为由铁道网连接着的新城市了。据战前统计：在一九二六年苏联开始进入工业化时期以后，从一九二七年到一九三八年短短的十二年中，全苏城市人口即由二千六百三十万人增加到五千五百九十万人，计增加了一倍多。
