Xinhua News Agency, Beiping, 5th: TASS, New York dispatch: United Mine Workers of America President Lewis recently announced the alarming number of accidents, deaths, and injuries among U.S. coal miners. The Senate Labor Committee is discussing a bill to strengthen labor safety regulations in the coal mining industry. Lewis stated before the committee that in the past nineteen years, a total of 1.25 million miners have been injured or killed in accidents in American coal mines. The most common injuries include broken spines, broken limbs, blindness, burns, and so on. During the same period, there were fourteen major explosions in coal mines, each resulting in the death or injury of more than one hundred miners. The most recent one occurred at the end of March 1947 in Centralia, Illinois, killing one hundred and eleven miners. Lewis also stated that in the eighteen months after the United States entered World War II, the number of miners killed or disabled was greater than the number of troops lost on the battlefield. There are nine hundred mines in the United States that are in a condition where accidents could occur at any time. Mine owners have reaped huge profits but are unwilling to spend money on improving safety measures. At the same time, they do not hesitate to use money to buy off members of Congress to defeat the bill to strengthen labor safety regulations in the coal mining industry. This kind of bribery was very successful in 1947. The United Mine Workers of America is demanding the passage of this bill and also demanding an investigation into the safety system of the entire U.S. coal mining industry, to standardize the safety methods of each coal mine, and to establish unified labor safety regulations. As is well known, American coal miners launched a strike movement in the spring of 1947 to protest the hazardous conditions in the mines.

　　美矿主十九年的血腥纪录
  　工人死伤达百廿万
    矿工联合会要求改善设备
    【新华社北平五日电】塔斯社纽约讯：美国矿工联合会主席路易斯顷发表美国煤矿工人的意外事件和死伤的惊人数目。参院劳工委员会正讨论加强管理煤矿工业劳动安全制法案。路易斯在这一委员会上声称，在过去十九年中。因美国煤矿发生意外事件而死伤的矿工共一百二十五万人。其中死伤最多的是脊骨断折、手足断折、盲目、火伤等等。同一时期，煤矿发生了十四次大爆炸，每次死伤矿工一百余人。最近一次在一九四七年三月底，在伊利诺州中部的森特拉利亚爆炸，死了一百十一个矿工。路易斯并称，在美国参加第二次大战后十八个月期间，矿工死亡或残废的数目比军队在战场损失的还要大。美国有九百个矿山是处于随时都可以发生意外事件的情况下。矿主获取了巨额利润，却不肯在改良安全制度上花钱。同时，他们却不惜以金钱收买议员来打消加强管理煤矿工业劳工安全制的法案。这种收买行为在一九四七年是做得很成功的。美国矿工联合会要求通过此一议案，同时要求调查全美煤矿业的安全制度，使各煤矿的安全方法标准化，并建立统一的劳工安全法规。如所周知，美国煤矿工人在一九四七年春天，为反对工人在矿中的险恶条件，曾发动了罢工运动。
