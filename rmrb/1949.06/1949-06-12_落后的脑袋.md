　　"Backward Brain"
　　　　　Li Erzheng
　　　　　(I) Ten-Year Plan
　　The First Squad of the First Platoon of the First Company, everyone from top to bottom, knew about Squad Leader Han. In his squad, including himself, there were ten people, and nine of them couldn't get along with him. Among the fourteen platoon leaders and deputy platoon leaders in the entire company, none of them thought Squad Leader Han was right. When the company commander and political instructor wanted to talk to Squad Leader Han, they always had to think carefully; if there was a sentence or even a word that he didn't like, he would spout out all sorts of strange things.
　　Squad Leader Han's full name was Junting, his nickname was Er Lengzi (Blockhead), and his alias was Yisheng Lei (Thunderclap). He was an old soldier, having joined the army in 1940. He was from a poor peasant family and was both stingy and hardworking. After enlisting, he remained a soldier. After the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, he was transferred from Hebei to the Northeast, still as a soldier. This time, the unit was reorganized into a railway corps and new soldiers were added. The higher-ups considered it again and again before reluctantly promoting him to squad leader. The higher-ups didn't promote him, they said, because he wasn't making progress, couldn't unite people, and didn't study properly. He himself didn't make progress or study because he couldn't understand: "Only promote others!" Thus, he fell behind many comrades. Some of those who enlisted at the same time as him had become company commanders and political instructors, and some had become battalion commanders and political commissars. The company commander in this company, for example, had enlisted at the same time as him. The higher-ups were really worried about his lack of progress. Once, the political instructor talked to him, urging him to study hard and improve his thinking. He said a lot, but whether Han Junting listened or not is another matter, but he didn't say a word, and sat on the bed next to the political instructor, puffing away at a roll-your-own cigarette. Finally, the political instructor said:
　　"Look, some of those who joined the army at the same time as you have become company commanders and political instructors, and some have even become battalion-level cadres. Shouldn't you be making progress yourself!?"
　　Hearing this sentence, Han Junting casually threw the half-smoked cigarette butt on the ground, stood up like a pillar, glanced disdainfully at the political instructor, slapped his butt, and turned to walk out, saying:
　　"I don't plan on becoming a cadre anyway! I have a ten-year plan – to be a soldier. I've already been one for five years, and I want to be one for another five years! Who can stop me!?"
　　This time, when he was promoted to squad leader, the political instructor talked to him again, in order to get his attention and encourage him to unite and make progress. As they talked, they got to the same issue. Han Junting said as usual:
　　"Don't you know I've already made a ten-year plan – to be a soldier? Is being a soldier shameful!? We didn't join the Eighth Route Army to get promoted and make a fortune!"
　　The entire company of the First Battalion knew about this famous "ten-year plan."
　　　　(II) "You Have to Obey My Orders!"
　　There were also some old soldiers in the first squad, such as Ma Ziliang, Zhao Baohai, and Zhang Chunshan, who had joined the army in 1943 and 1944. Although they were old, they couldn't compare to Han Junting. When it came to fighting the enemy and working on the front lines, Han Junting was definitely the best in the squad. So, he wanted to be better than everyone in everything. Once, at the work site, the first squad was tasked with pushing large iron rails on flatcars. Everyone loaded the large rails onto the flatcars, and just as the nine of them were about to push forward, Han Junting sat down on top of the flatcar. The nine soldiers were a little anxious when they saw this. The new soldiers didn't dare to say anything and just watched from the side. Zhang Chunshan was a little unconvinced and said:
　　"Squad Leader! Can you please get down? It's very heavy!"
　　"Get down where?"
　　"Get down to the ground!"
　　"You want me to walk underground?"
　　"That's right!?"
　　"Okay!..."
　　Han Junting jumped down immediately. The nine of them reached out to push the car, but Han Junting's eyes widened, and he shouted loudly:
　　"Don't push it! Carry it! I'm the squad leader, you have to obey my orders!"
　　Ma Ziliang and some other comrades saw that the matter was about to stall, fearing it would delay the work ahead. They knew that Han Junting had the stubbornness of a donkey, and wouldn't change his mind even if it got dark. Only by going along with him could the matter be resolved. They were used to his ways, and said with smiles on their faces:
　　"Squad Leader! Let's just push it! We wouldn't dare disobey!? You sit on the car and rest, we'll push! They're waiting up ahead!"
　　"Go on! I'm not sitting anymore! I'll wait for you here!... I'll see if you obey me too!"
　　Han Junting sat on the ground, rolled a cigarette, and slowly smoked it, while the nine soldiers delivered the carload of rails.
　　　　(III) "How Many Two-and-a-Half Foot Pieces of Cloth Have You Worn Out!?"
　　Once, after the troops finished a section of engineering work, they prepared to set off to another place to repair roads. In the meantime, several incidents occurred in succession, making the whole squad angry.
　　Before departure, the higher-ups issued each person a towel. Han Junting already had five towels stored in his backpack. Seeing the towel he received this time, he was still very interested. He took all ten towels that the squad should have received from the company, and looked at them at least three times along the way. One of them was particularly patterned and tightly woven. He knew at a glance and touch that it was the best of the ten. Back in the squad, he said:
　　"The towels we received this time are different. Some are better, some are worse! Naturally, everyone wants the good ones, and no one wants the bad ones. What do you say we do?"
　　"..............."
　　No one said anything. After a while, he continued:
　　"I have an idea: put all the towels in a sack, and you all stand in line in order. Starting with the first person, I'll take one out and give it to them. If you get a good one, you get a good one. If you get a bad one, you get a bad one. It depends on your luck! What do you say?"
　　"Whatever Squad Leader says is fine!" one soldier said.
　　"Good! If you agree, we'll do it that way!"
　　When he was putting the towels into the sack, he only put in nine, leaving the patterned and tightly woven one aside. The soldiers all watched with their eyes open. Han Junting looked at everyone and said:
　　"I can't take one out for myself. I'll keep this one. It's mine!"
　　"I want that one!" Ma Ziliang said.
　　"Am I the squad leader or are you the squad leader? If the higher-ups let me be the squad leader, you have to listen to my orders! Can't be like that average-ism!" Han Junting said with a straight face. "Individuals also have to look at themselves, and think about how many two-and-a-half foot pieces of cloth you've worn out! Can you compare to me!?"
　　After the supplies were replenished, the troops marched for three days. The weather was already the end of the ninth lunar month, and warm kangs (heated brick beds) were tempting everywhere. The first day they camped, Han Junting gathered the whole squad and had them stand in formation, saying:
　　"One kang only has one kang head. Not all ten of us can sleep there. We'll sleep on the kang in order of seniority, starting from me, then him, then him... one after another!"
　　That's how they stayed the first day. Everyone had opinions in their stomachs, but didn't say them out loud. They stayed like that again the second day, and still like that on the third day. The soldiers were grumbling a lot. Han Junting didn't like what he heard, and gathered the whole squad to speak. He gave many reasons, but in the end, it was still:
　　"...Average-ism!? How many two-and-a-half foot pieces of cloth have you worn out!?"
　　And then he added a new sentence: "You can't just compare yourselves to the person in charge!"
　　　　(IV) Self-Criticism Meeting
　　The person Han Junting disliked the most was Ma Ziliang, because although he often said a few good words to the squad leader in person, he was also the one who criticized Han Junting in person. When the column arrived near Zhangwu Bridge, Ma Ziliang’s scabies flared up again, making it difficult for him to walk. One time, the company wanted the squad to send someone to deliver a message to headquarters. Han Junting sent no one but Ma Ziliang. Ma Ziliang said:
　　"Squad Leader! My scabies have flared up again. Send someone else!"
　　"Aren't you not dead yet? If you’re not dead, you have to obey orders!"
　　"I can't walk!"
　　"You're disobeying?" Han Junting shrieked!
　　"I'm sick! I just won't obey!" Ma Ziliang also retorted!
　　"If you don’t obey, then you cannot! I will punish you! I..."
　　"Don't try to scare people with that! I have a head to withstand anything!"
　　The situation became stiff. Han Junting shouted that he "can't go on anymore," while Ma Ziliang shouted, "This is outrageous!" The other soldiers sympathized with Ma Ziliang. The matter immediately went to the political instructor. The political instructor tried to persuade them, but they didn't continue to argue. That evening, the political instructor personally attended a squad meeting, asking everyone to engage in self-criticism. The political instructor said:
　　"The lack of unity within the squad has been going on for more than just a day! If things continue like this, the work will definitely not be done well! Everyone needs to engage in self-criticism, especially Comrade Han Junting, who is the leader of the squad and should engage in even more self-criticism!..."
　　After the political instructor spoke, the soldiers' mouths were moving. Before anyone could speak, Han Junting preempted them and said:
　　"I'll do a self-criticism first! Self-criticism is for seeking progress and experience. Chairman Mao told us long ago that we must engage in self-criticism! We must wash our faces and look in the mirror, opposing arrogance, subjectivism, disobedience to the organization, and individualism! Participating in the revolution, the most important thing is to obey the organization and strengthen organizational awareness. Without an organization, if you want to resist the war, there are enemies everywhere, including fortresses, destroyed civilian trenches, and automobile roads. The puppet army and Japanese soldiers are useless… Why can our Eighth Route Army resist? Because the organization is good! The individual must obey the organization, and the lower levels must obey the higher levels…”
　　"You should do self-criticism about yourself!" said the political instructor:
　　"As for myself, I know I have many mistakes. As the political instructor often says: only dead people and babies in the womb don’t make mistakes! Admitting mistakes is not shameful! I am doing self-criticism! Ever since I came to the first squad, the tasks have all been completed. Revolution, serving the people, means completing the tasks given by the higher authorities…"
　　Han Junting spoke for over an hour, without mentioning a single one of his own shortcomings. The lights-out bugle had already sounded, and everyone was dozing off. The political instructor couldn't help it and announced the end of the meeting.
　　　　(V) "The Backward Brain Still Has Some Use!"
　　The enemy had destroyed Zhangwu Bridge. The enemy had retreated into Zhangwu City.
　　The troops arrived at Zhangwu Bridge, monitoring the enemy while rushing to repair Zhangwu Bridge, in order to ensure the rear supply line for the main forces attacking Jinzhou. The battalion held a meeting to mobilize the troops, and the company also held a meeting to mobilize them. Before the military meeting, a branch meeting was first held, followed by a meeting of cadres above squad leader. The political instructor talked about the importance of rushing to repair Zhangwu Bridge, as well as the exemplary spirit and precautions that every cadre and Party member should have. Here, the political instructor particularly emphasized strengthening "enemy situation awareness," and being "prepared for combat" at all times. Some of the newly participating squad leaders were hearing the term "enemy situation awareness" for the first time. Although they vaguely knew from the tone and context that it meant everyone should pay attention to the enemy, they were still a little confused, and some were a little uneasy.
　　"How many enemies are there? Just our unit? Are there other troops?"
　　"How far are we from the main forces?"
　　"Will the enemy not come north again?"
　　"..............."
　　Everyone raised many worrying questions. Han Junting's face was expressionless, as usual, and it was hard to guess whether he was afraid or calm. As usual, he squatted at the very back of the meeting, puffing away at his self-rolled cigarettes. The political instructor was explaining to everyone:
　　"Don't panic! We have our main forces up front, and the enemy won't dare to come north often! But, you can't rule out the possibility of them coming to make trouble once in a while. Anyway, if they don't come, we'll repair the bridge. If they do come, we'll fight them!..."
　　Han Junting understood in his heart: the political instructor hadn't fought in a war, and probably hadn't fired a gun except for shooting at targets twice. He listened to the political instructor saying "fight them," glanced at him, and went back to smoking. From beginning to end, Han Junting didn't say a word. The political instructor saw that he didn't say anything, and thought that it was good that he wasn't causing trouble. The company commander was an old comrade-in-arms of Han Junting, and at this time, he thought of him. When everyone was silent, the company commander asked:
　　"Old Han! Do you have any opinions? Speak up!"
　　"No opinions! If they don't come, fine, but if they come, we'll fight them!" He emphasized the words "fight them" very heavily, imitating the political instructor's tone.
　　"How can we fight well!? The new troops, not all of them have fought!" The company commander sincerely asked Han Junting for advice.
　　"If we fight well, everyone gets gruel! If we don't fight well, aren't there tigers herding sheep waiting for us! What's there to be afraid of!" Han Junting clearly had an opinion.
　　"Old Han! Don't joke around! Seriously, everyone doesn't have much experience. You have a lot of experience fighting the enemy. Do you see anything that we should remind everyone of? Tell us! Are you really waiting for everyone to herd sheep?"
　　"..." Han Junting moved his mouth a few times, but didn't speak. He lit another cigarette, exhaled the smoke from his mouth, blew it upwards, and then inhaled it into his nose. Everyone looked at him. Only then did he slowly say: "I didn't expect that my backward brain still has some use!..."
　　Having said this, Han Junting stopped, taking one puff of his cigarette after another. The political instructor impatiently scratched his head, and some other comrades leaned against the wall, and some whispered about other things. Only the company commander looked at Han Junting with a particularly amiable expression, gesturing for him to continue.
　　"I say, in our company, some squads don't have anyone who has fought in a war, while others – like our squad – have a few who have fought in a war. It would be best to allocate one or two people to each squad! Having heard the sound of bullets is definitely better than not having heard it, so they won't lose their bearings as soon as they hear gunfire... Also, those in charge of the machine guns are thinly staffed. In case something happens, if there are casualties, they won't even be able to drag them away. I think we should assign one or two squads to work with them..."
　　Everyone was surprised to hear this, that someone like him would actually be concerned about the work and have a plan in mind. The political instructor also asked:
　　"Which squad should we send to help the machine gun?"
　　"Send Old Han's squad! Old Han and Ma Ziliang both learned about machine guns, so it's more convenient!" someone suggested.
　　"I agree! If enemy planes or something really come, with Old Han plus a machine gun, we won't let it land, and we won't let it go back whole!" other comrades supported.
　　Afterwards, they discussed how to allocate those with combat experience and how to group and lead the new soldiers. Han Junting's two suggestions were completely accepted by everyone.
　　After the meeting, the political instructor said to the company commander:
　　"Old Han is actually a bit interesting!"
　　"He's been doing this for so many years, he has experience! As long as his thinking straightens out!" The company commander said, "Today, if we hadn't persuaded him left and right, he would have just said a few sarcastic remarks!"
　　"In the future, respect him more, and maybe he'll make progress faster than if we criticize him more!"
　　"That's what I'm worried about!" said the company commander.
　　When the political instructor gave a speech at roll call that evening, he particularly called on the old comrades to play a backbone role, and for the new comrades to learn from the old comrades in times of tension and danger, emphasizing that the old comrades had experience and methods. Not only Han Junting, but all the old comrades felt that their responsibilities were greater. As soon as they got back that evening, Han Junting spoke to Ma Ziliang, Zhang Chunshan, and Zhao Baohai for the first time:
　　"We're very close to the enemy right now, and all the new comrades in the squad and company are watching us! If we panic, they'll have to run! We have to be calm, so they can be confident! The political instructor made it clear that we should play a backbone role, and we have to do it in our squad! If something happens, you grab the new comrades and follow me, and see what I do!"

　　“落后的脑袋”
    李尔重
  　　　　　（一）十年计划
    拉起一营一连一班的韩班长，从上到下，没有一个人不知道。他这个班连他在内，共有十个人，就有九个人和他合不来。全连里有正副班长十四名，有正副排长六名，没有一个听到韩班长不对头的。连长指导员要和韩班长谈话，老是要犯颠算的；只要有一句或一个字，他听着不顺耳，什么新鲜话都会从他口里蹦出来的。
    韩班长大名叫俊庭，小名叫二楞子，外号叫做一声雷，是个老战士，一九四○年参军，是个又扣索又勤苦的贫农出身。入伍以后一直地当战士，抗日战争胜利后，由河北开到关外，还当战士，这次部队改编为铁道部队增加了新战士，上级考虑又考虑勉强地把他提升为班长，上级不提拔他说是因为他不进步，不能团结人，不好好学习；他本人不进步不学习，因为自己想不通：“光提拔别人！”这样地他就落在许多同志的后面，和他同年入伍的，有的当了连长指导员，有的当了营长教导员；在这一连以内的连长，就是和他同时入伍的一个。上级着实为他这不进步着急，有一次教导员找他谈话，劝他努力学习，好好锻炼思想，讲了很多，韩俊庭听没听且不说，总是没有吭声，并且在教导员旁边的铺上坐着，巴答巴答地接二连三地吸着黄烟。临煞尾，教导员说了一句：
    “你看，和你同时参军的，有的当了连长指导员，还有的当了营级干部，自己还不该进步么！？”
    韩俊庭听了这句话，顺手把未吸完的半截纸卷黄烟，一把摔在地上，身子象柱子似地立起来，眼向教导员轻藐地斜了一下，一拍屁股，转身就向外走，嘴里说道：
    “我也不打算当干部！我有十年计划——当战士。已经当了五年，我还想再当五年！谁还能挡我！？……”
    这次，提他当班长时，为了提起他注意，好好团结进步，指导员又找他谈话，谈着谈着也谈到同一问题上，韩俊庭照样地说道：
    “你不知道我早就订下了十年计划——当战士？当战士就丢人！？当八路军也不是为升官发财来的！”
    一营全体干部和战士，没有一个不知道这有名的“十年计划”。
    　　　　（二）“得服从我的命令！”
    一班里的战士，也有几个老战士，象马子亮赵宝海张春山三个都是一九四三年和四四年参军的。虽然也老，终比不过韩俊庭。论对阵杀敌，在火线上干，在一班韩俊庭更是数着第一了。所以凡事他都要压人一等。有一回，在现场上，一班担任用平车子推大铁（铁轨——注）的任务，大家把大铁装在平车上，九个人才要向前推，韩俊庭一屁股坐到平车上头去了，九个战士一看就有点急眼，新战士们没敢吭气，在一旁看着不动手推；张春山有些不服，说道：
    “班长！你下来好不好？大沉的！”
    “下哪里去呀？”
    “下地下来呗！”
    “让我下地下走哇？”
    “那可不！？”
    “好！……”
    韩俊庭一下子跳了下来；九个人伸手就推车子，韩俊庭两眼瞪的溜圆，大声喊道：
    “别推啦！给我抬！我是班长，就得服从我的命令！”
    马子亮和几个别的同志一看这个事要僵起来，恐怕误了前边工作，他们知道韩俊庭是个犟驴皮气，扭到天黑不改口的；顺着他点，事情才能解决。他们已经看惯了他这一套，满脸堆笑地说道：
    “班长！还是推吧！我们还能有个不服从！？还是你坐车上歇歇，我们推！前边还等着用呢！”
    “去吧！我不坐啦！在这儿等你们！……我看你们也得服从我！”
    韩俊庭坐在地上卷了一枝烟慢慢吸着，九个战士把一车子轨条送走。
    　　　　（三）“你们才穿坏了几个二尺半！？”
    那次部队修完了一段工程，准备出发到另外一个地方去修路，在这当中，接连着出了几宗事，弄的全班窝火。
    在出发之前，上级一人发了一条毛巾，韩俊庭的背包里，往日存下来的毛巾，还有五条；见到这回领来的毛巾，他还是十二分地有兴趣。他从连里把全班应领的十条毛巾拿来，一路走着，足看了有三遍，内中有一条又花、又密实，手一摸眼一看，就知道它在这十条里第一，回到班里，他说道：
    “这回领的手巾可不一样，有好点的，有坏点的！自然是都想要好的，谁也不愿要孬的，你们说怎么分？”
    “………………”
    大家谁也没言语，沉了一会，他又说道：
    “你们都不说，我提个办法：把手巾全放到麻袋里，你们站好，排好次序，从第一个人起，我掏一条给一条，赶上好就好，赶上不好就不好，凭个人的运气！你们说行不行？”
    “班长说行就行！”一个战士说。
    “好！你们赞成咱们就这么办！”
    当着向麻袋装手巾时，只装了九条，单把那条又花又密实的留下了，战士们都睁眼看着，韩俊庭望了望大家，说道：
    “我不能给我个人掏，我把这条留下，算我的！”
    “我还要这条呢！”马子亮说：
    “是你当班长是我当班长？要是上级让我当班长，就得听我的命令！不能这样平均主义！”韩俊庭板着个脸说：“个人也得看看自己，想一想，你们才穿坏了几个二尺半！和我比！？……”
    东西补充齐了之后，部队行了三天路，天气已经是阴历九月末了，热炕头到处招人喜欢。第一天宿营的时候，韩俊庭把全班集合站队，说道：
    “一个炕就一个炕头，不能十个人都睡。咱们今天睡炕打排头向下排，我第一、他第二他第三……一个挨一个！”
    第一天是这样地住了，大家肚里有意见，没有说出口来。第二天又是这样地住了，第三天还是这样地住了。战士们嘟嘟哝哝的就不少。韩俊庭听了不入耳，把全班集合讲话，道理很多，说到最后，还是：
    “……平均主义！？你们才穿破了几个二尺半！？”
    临末又加了一句新的：“你们不能动不动就和负责人攀！”
    　　　　（四）检讨会
    韩俊庭心眼里最烦的是马子亮，因为他虽然常当面说班长两句好话，可是当面批评韩俊庭的也是他。行车到了彰武桥边住下，马子亮的疥又发了一些，行走就困难。有一次连里要一班派个人去给营部送信，韩俊庭谁也不派，偏派马子亮。马子亮说：
    “班长！我的疥又发了，派个别人去吧！”
    “你不是没死么？没死就得服从命令！”
    “我走不动么！”
    “你不服从？”韩俊庭嘎嘎地叫起来！
    “我有病么！我就不服从！”马子亮也犟了起来！
    “不服从就不行！我要处罚你！我……”
    “不用拿那个吓唬人哪！有一个脑袋什么都顶住了！”
    这一家伙弄僵了，韩俊庭吵着“不能再干下去”，马子亮吵着：“这还了得！”别的战士们都同情马子亮。事情一下子闹到指导员那里。指导员左说右劝，才没有继续吵下去，晚上指导员亲自出席，在一班召集了一个班务会，要大家检讨。指导员说：
    “一班内部不团结，已经不是一天了！这样闹下去，工作一定做不好！大家要好好检讨，尤其是韩俊庭同志，是全班的领导人，更应该好好检讨！……”
    指导员谈完，战士们嘴在鼓动着；还未等大家开口，韩俊庭抢先说道：
    “我先来检讨检讨！检讨，为了求进步，求经验，毛主席老早就告诉我们说，要检讨！要洗脸，照镜子，反对自高自大、主观主义、不服从组织、个人主义！参加革命，顶重要的就是服从组织，加强组织观念，没个组织，你想抗战，四外都是敌人，又是碉堡，又是毁民沟，又是汽车路，皇协军日本兵又孬……咱们八路军为什么抗的住？组织好么！个人要服从组织，下级要服从上级……。”
    “你检讨你个人吧！”指导员说：
    “我个人，我知道我错误很多，不是教导员常说：只有死人和肚子里的小孩不犯错误！检讨错误，也不算丢人！我检讨！自打我到一班，任务也都完成了，革命，为人民服务，就要完成上级给的任务……”
    韩俊庭讲了有一个多钟头，还没有讲到自己一点缺点。息灯号已经吹了，大家都在打磕睡，指导员无法，宣布了散会。
    　　　　（五）“落后脑袋还有点用！”
    敌人把彰武桥给破坏了。敌人缩在彰武城里。
    部队开到彰武桥边，一面监视敌人，一面抢修彰武桥，以便保证打锦州主力部队的后方供应线。营里开会做了动员，连里又开会动员。军人大会之前，先召集支部会，又召集班长以上干部开会，指导员谈了抢修彰武桥的重要性，也谈了每个干部党员应有的模范精神和注意事项。在这里，指导员特别强调要加强“敌情观念”，要时刻做“战斗准备”。有些新参加的班长，还是第一次听到“敌情观念”这个名词，虽然从口气上从前后言词上看，模模糊糊地知道是要大家注意敌人，到底还是有点发朦，有的就有点不安的样子。
    “敌人到底有多少哇？单咱们这个部队？还有别的队伍么！”
    “咱们离主力部队还有多远哪？”
    “敌人不会向北再来了么？”
    “………………”
    大家提出许多耽心的问题。韩俊庭脸上和往常一样地没有表情，谁也难猜清他是在害怕还是在沉静着。他和往常一样：开会蹲在尽后边，巴答巴答地抽黄烟。指导员给大家解释着：
    “不要恐慌！前边有咱们主力，敌人不敢老向北来！可是，也背不住来捣乱一回，反正，它不来，咱们就修桥。它要来，咱们就要和它干干！……”
    韩俊庭心里明白：指导员没有打过仗，大概除了打过两次靶以外，就没有放过枪。他听着指导员说干干，用眼瞟了一下，又吸烟去了。自始至终，韩俊庭一句话也没有说，指导员看他没有说话，寻思着没有捣蛋还不错。连长是韩俊庭的老战友，这时却想起了他，当大家都没话时，连长问了一句：
    “老韩！你有什么意见？说说！”
    “没意见！不来便罢，来了咱们就干干！”干干两字咬的很重，学的是指导员的腔调。
    “怎么干，才能干好哇！？新队伍，不同都打过仗的呀！”连长真心诚意地向韩俊庭请教着。
    “干好了大家喝粥！干不好还不是有老虎放羊等着呢！怕什么！”韩俊庭明摆着是有意见。
    “老韩！别说笑话！真的，大家都没多少经验，你和敌人作战经验多，看有什么该提醒大家，提提！真等着大家放羊么？”
    “……”韩俊庭把嘴鼓动了几下，且莫说话，又吸着了一枝烟，烟气从口里吐出来，喷向上，又打鼻子吸进去，大家望着他，这才慢慢地说道：“想不到我这落后脑袋还有点用！……”
    说到这里，韩俊庭把话打住，一口接一口地吸烟，指导员不耐烦地抓脑袋，别的同志们有的靠在墙上，有的小声谈论别的了。只有连长特别和悦地望着韩俊庭呶嘴，意思是要他说下去。
    “我说，照咱们连，有的班里一个打过仗的没有，有的——象咱们班——有几个打过仗的，这顶好是各班配一配！听过子溜子响的，到底比没听过的要强些，不至于一听枪响就不知东西南北。……再就是管机关炮的，人数都单薄，万一有事，有个伤亡，拖都拖不走，我看，得单派上一两个班，配他们一齐工作………”
    大家一听，觉着很奇怪，象他这样个人竟然心里也挂念着工作，心里也有个数。指导员也问道：
    “派那个班帮助伊斯古机（机关炮——注）呢？”
    “就派老韩的一班！老韩和马子亮都学过伊斯古，更方便！”有个人提议着。
    “赞成！真要是敌人飞机什么的来了，有老韩一个再加上一架伊斯古，不请它落地，也不能让他整个回去！”别的同志们拥护着。
    之后，又讨论了一下，老的有战斗经验的如何调剂，如何分组带领新战士。韩俊庭提的两条意见，完全被大家接受了。
    散会之后，指导员对连长说了一句：
    “老韩这个人还是有点意思呢！”
    “他干了这些年，经验是有的！只要他思想顺过来！”连长说：“今天，要不是左劝右劝，他还不是说两句风凉话算了！”
    “以后，多尊重他点，比多批评，可能进步还快些！”

    到了晚上点名讲话时，指导员特别号召老同志要起骨干作用，新同志要在紧张危难中向老同志学习，强调老同志有经验有办法。不单韩俊庭，连所有老同志听了都感到自己的责任重大些。晚上一回来，韩俊庭第一次地对马子亮张春山赵宝海进行了谈话：
    “眼下离敌人很近，全班全连新同志，都看咱们的呢！咱们要是一慌，他们就得拿丫子（跑的意思——注）！咱们要沉着，他们才能有准性骨！指导员说的明白，要咱们起骨干，在咱们班咱们几个一定得做到！万一有什么事情，你们就抓着新同志跟着我，看我动作行事！”
