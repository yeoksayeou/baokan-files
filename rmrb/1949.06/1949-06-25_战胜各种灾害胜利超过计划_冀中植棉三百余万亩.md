Ji Zhong Plants Over Three Million Mu of Cotton After Triumphing Over Various Disasters, Victory Exceeding Planned Targets.
The entire region mobilized to realize planting plans.
[Ji Zhong Electric] By the end of May, the Ji Zhong region had completed planting over 3,290,000 mu of cotton, exceeding the original plan of 3,000,000 mu. The entire region has completed planting over 1,860,000 mu of peanuts, fulfilling 93% of the planned 2,000,000 mu. The spring planting plan has been basically realized. In spring production, the entire Ji Zhong Party and people mobilized together. Under the unified leadership of Party committees and governments at all levels, a large number of cadres went to the countryside to universally mobilize and organize the broad masses to wage arduous struggles against various natural disasters such as spring drought and insect plagues. After deploying agricultural production work in February, various preparations for production were carried out in conjunction with the movement to join the army and return home. After the work of joining the army and returning home ended, it was promptly shifted to organizing the realization of the production plan. In early May, the Ji Zhong region generally experienced drought and lack of rain. Various places vigorously carried out anti-drought sowing campaigns, extensively mobilized the repair and digging of wells, used all possible water power, and loaned out a large number of seeds to ensure the sowing of cotton, and organized timely replanting and seedling protection work. Cadres at all levels went all out to the countryside to carry out shock work. Rural Party member cadres took the lead in driving the broad masses with their exemplary roles, and finally overcame the drought. Various insect plagues constantly occurred in the unearthed spring seedlings in various places. However, because they were put out as soon as they were discovered, they did not spread or cause serious disasters. After the region generally experienced rainfall in late May, various places immediately mobilized to fully turn to the shock sowing movement of planting peanuts and large autumn crops. Thus far, the region has been able to successfully complete the planting tasks of cotton, peanuts, and large autumn crops.

Publicizing Party Policies, Breaking Down Production Obstacles
In production, various places also carried out extensive publicity and mobilization, implementing the Party's policies and the specific methods of the People's Government to reward agricultural production. At the beginning of the movement, some farmers were afraid that planting too much cotton would lead to no sales, lack of firewood, grain, and grass, and some were afraid of labor costs due to lack of manpower. Some farmers who were not accustomed to planting cotton felt that they lacked technology, etc.; in particular, the vast majority of farmers still had a strong self-sufficient ideology in production, which were all obstacles to completing the planting of cotton and peanuts. Cadres at all levels promptly strengthened publicity, explaining the new urban-rural relationship under the current new situation and the new requirements for rural agricultural production put forward by the development of urban industrial production, and announced the method of not exceeding 25 jin per mu of public grain and not exceeding 5 jin of village grain, and the method stipulated by the North China People's Government for paying public grain at a discounted price for ginned cotton and peanuts; various places also used vivid examples of farmers making profits from planting cotton to educate the farmers. Methods such as old farmers' symposiums were used to study cotton planting technology. After the masses' concerns were basically broken, men, women, and children were widely organized. According to the statistics of 1,763 villages in six counties of the Eleventh Special Zone, 244,523 people were organized, including 77,774 women (some of which made the mistake of forced organization). Peanuts were mainly shock-planted after the rain on May 21. After the rain, the Party, government, military, people's organizations, troops, and students at all levels mostly actually participated in helping with planting. Ji Zhong alone extracted nearly 10,000 people. The difficulties of farmers lacking seeds were solved by vigorously lending out cotton and peanut seeds. 2,200,000 jin of cotton seeds and 1,000,000 jin of peanut seeds were lent out in April.

Shortcomings and Deviations in Spring Plowing and Sowing
However, there are still the following shortcomings and deviations in the spring sowing movement: (1) Some do not proceed from reality, force orders, and insist that farmers plant more peanuts and cotton. (2) In many places, formalism is still very serious in production leadership. Some are still satisfied with general appeals and statistics of numbers. The work stagnates on the surface, and lacks thorough and systematic specific leadership. Some places have not yet truly gone deep. (3) There was insufficient preparation of peanut seeds in advance, so that when a comprehensive shock sowing occurred after the rain, the seed problem could not be solved. The Eleventh Special Zone had to temporarily extract 1,000,000 jin of rice to Shen County to exchange for peanuts after the rain, resulting in forced purchases and popular dissatisfaction. (4) In some areas, the understanding of the arduousness of improving agricultural production is insufficient in the leadership ideology, and there is a laissez-faire image.

    战胜各种灾害胜利超过计划
    冀中植棉三百余万亩
    全区一致动员实现种植计划
    【冀中电】截至五月底，冀中全区完成种棉三百二十九万余亩，超过了原订三百万亩的计划。全区已完成种花生一百八十六万余亩，完成预定计划二百万亩的百分之九十三。基本实现了春季种植计划。在春季生产中，冀中全党全民一致动员，在各级党委和政府的统一领导下，大批干部下乡，普遍的发动与组织广大群众，与春旱、虫灾等各种自然灾害进行了艰苦的斗争。自二月份布置了农业生产工作后，结合参军归队运动，进行了生产的各种准备工作，参军归队工作结束后，又及时转入组织生产计划的实现。五月上旬，冀中全区普遍天旱不雨，各地大力开展了抗旱点种运动，广泛发动修井挖井，使用一切可能使用的水力，贷借大批种子，保证了棉花的下种，并组织了及时的补苗保苗工作。各级干部全力下乡突击，农村党员干部，又以自己的模范作用带动广大群众，终于战胜了旱灾。各地春苗出土曾不断发生了各种虫灾，由于随发现随扑灭，因而未得蔓延和造成严重灾害。在五月下旬全区普遍落雨后，各地又立即动员全力转入赶种花生和大秋作物的突击播种运动，至此，全区得以胜利完成了种棉花花生及大秋作物的种植任务。
    宣传党的政策打破生产障碍
    生产中各地并深入进行了广泛的宣传动员，贯彻了党的政策和人民政府奖励农业生产的具体办法。当运动开始时，曾有的农民怕种棉多了没销路，怕缺柴缺粮缺草，还有的因人手少而怕费工，有些没有种棉习惯的农民，觉得缺乏技术等等；特别是广大农民在生产上还存在着浓厚的自给自足思想，这些都是完成种棉和种花生的障碍。各级干部及时加强宣传，说明了目前新形势下新的城乡关系和发展城市工业生产对农村农业生产提出了新的要求，宣布了每负担亩公粮不超过二十五斤，村粮不超过五斤的办法，和华北人民政府规定的皮棉、花生折价缴纳公粮的办法；各地并用农民中种棉获利的生动实例，教育了农民。采用老农座谈会等方法，研究了种棉技术。群众顾虑基本上打破之后，男女老幼广泛的组织起来。据十一专区六个县一千七百六十三个村的统计，组织起来了二十四万四千五百二十三人，其中有妇女七万七千七百七十四人（其中有的是犯了强迫组织的错误）。花生主要是在五月二十一日落雨后突击播种的，雨后各级党政军民各机关、团体、军队、学生，大部实际参加助种，仅冀中一级即抽出将近万人。由于大力贷发棉花、花生种子，帮助农民解决了缺乏种子的困难。四月份即贷出棉籽二百二十万斤，花生种子一百万斤。
    春耕播种中的缺点和偏向
    但是在春季播种运动中还有以下的缺点和偏向：（１）有的不从实际出发，强迫命令，硬要农民多种花生、棉花。（２）不少地方在生产领导上形式主义还很严重，有的仍然满足于一般号召和数目字的统计，工作停滞在表面的烘火热闹，缺乏周密系统的具体领导，有些地方还未能真正深入下去。（３）花生种子，事前准备不足，以致雨后全面突击播种时，又发生种子问题不能解决。十一专区，雨后不得不临时抽出一百万斤米到深县换花生，致形成强买，群众不满。（４）有些地区在领导思想上对于提高农业生产的艰巨性认识不足，有自流放任形象。
