Xinhua News Agency, Prague, 1st - The 26th of May was the second day of the Czechoslovak Communist Party Congress. Besides the report by the General Secretary of the Czechoslovak Communist Party, Slánský, the most attention-grabbing items for the delegates and guests were Chairman Mao's congratulatory telegram to the Congress, the news of the Chinese People's Liberation Army's entry into Shanghai, and the congratulatory speech by the Chinese Communist Party representative, Qian Junrui. The Congress throughout the day was permeated with the utmost respect and internationalist friendship for the Chinese people and their leader, Mao Zedong.

　　In the morning, as the presidium and the representatives of over forty fraternal parties took their seats, a burst of cheers suddenly erupted in the hall: "Shanghai of the People!" "Long Live Mao Zedong!" The eyes of over three thousand delegates turned to Comrade Qian Junrui, the representative of the Chinese Communist Party, sitting in the middle below the presidium, cheering and waving to him.

　　The chairman of the congress, Vice-Premier Fierlinger, announced the opening of the meeting. He first informed everyone that the congress had received thousands upon thousands of congratulatory telegrams, one of which had to be read immediately: the congratulatory telegram from Chairman Mao of the Chinese Communist Party. As he read it into the microphone, all the delegates and guests stood up. The Czech translation he read, and the translations simultaneously disseminated in Russian, English, French, German, and other languages, were immediately overwhelmed by a storm of applause and cheers.

　　Fierlinger then announced the liberation of Shanghai, pointing out that this stronghold, which had been used by imperialism to enslave the Chinese and Southeast Asian peoples for a century, was now occupied by the Chinese working people. He then raised his arm and shouted, "This historic victory is also our victory! Long live the new China under the leadership of the Communist Party!" The hall erupted once again in shouts of "Long Live Comrade Mao Zedong!"

　　Immediately following Slánský's report, Qian Junrui, on behalf of the Chinese Communist Party, delivered a congratulatory speech. He pointed out that the brilliant achievements of Czechoslovakia on the path of building socialism were inseparable from the name of Gottwald and from the assistance of the Soviet Union, the main force in winning the Second World War. The victory of the Chinese people in the liberation war against the Kuomintang feudal fascist rule instigated by American imperialism, as Comrade Mao Zedong said, is the third greatest victory of progressive humanity after the October Revolution and the victory of the Second World War. He went on to say that this was not accidental, but a victory of proletarian internationalism under the leadership of Comrade Mao Zedong, a victory of the revolutionary theories of Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin. Chairman Mao taught us that without the assistance of the Communist Parties and the working class of the world, the Chinese revolution could not have been victorious. Without the existence of the Soviet Union, without the existence of the Eastern European people's democratic countries, the Chinese revolution would not have been possible.

　　After the speech by the representative of the Chinese Communist Party, the delegates and guests at the congress cheered enthusiastically. Gottwald, Slánský, and other comrades of the presidium stood up and extended their fraternal hands to the representative of the Chinese Communist Party. At the same time, the Soviet delegation, led by Malenkov, the General Secretary of the Italian Communist Party, Togliatti, the Secretary of the French Communist Party, Marty, the General Secretary of the British Communist Party, Pollitt, and the Chairman of the German Socialist Unity Party, Pieck, all came to shake hands with the representative of the Chinese Communist Party. The representative of the true communists of Yugoslavia, who came from a farther seat, held the hand of the Chinese Communist Party representative and said, "Thank you, Comrade Mao Zedong." These few short words conveyed boundless profound meaning.

　　When the chairman announced the adjournment, representatives of the Communist Parties from South America to Northern Europe, from Greece to Spain, were still shaking hands with the representative of the Chinese Communist Party.

　　捷共代表大会上欢庆中国人民胜利
  　四十余国兄弟党代表同声欢呼毛泽东万岁
    【新华社布拉格一日专电】五月二十六日是捷共代表大会开会的第二天。这一天除了捷共总书记斯兰斯基的报告外，最吸引代表和来宾注意的，是中国共产党毛主席致大会的贺电，中国人民解放军攻入上海的消息，和中共代表钱俊瑞的贺词。大会这一天自始至终洋溢着对中国人民及其领袖毛泽东的无上敬意和国际主义的友谊。
    上午，当主席团和四十余国兄弟党代表们入席时，会场上突然爆发了一阵欢呼：“人民的上海！”“毛泽东万岁！”三千多代表的眼光都投向坐在主席团下面中间的中共代表钱俊瑞同志，向他欢呼，向他招手。
    大会主席副总理费林格宣布开会了。他首先告诉大家，大会收到了成千成百的贺电，其中有一个必须立即宣读，这就是中共毛主席的贺电。在他对着扩音机朗读的时候，全体代表和来宾都站起来。他所念的捷文译稿，和同时用俄、英、法、德等文传播出来的译稿，马上被暴风般的掌声和欢呼所压盖了。
    费林格接着宣布上海解放的消息，指出这一个百年来曾是帝国主义奴役中国人民和东南亚人民的巩固堡垒，现在被中国劳动人民占领了。于是他振臂高呼：“这个历史的胜利也是我们的胜利！在共产党领导下的新中国万岁！”全场又一次沸腾起“毛泽东同志万岁！”的欢呼声。
    紧接着斯兰斯基报告之后，钱俊瑞代表中共致贺词。他指出捷克斯洛伐克在建设社会主义的路程上所获得的光辉成就，是和哥特瓦尔德的名字分不开的，是和赢得第二次世界大战的主力军苏联的援助分不开的。中国人民在反对美帝国主义指使的国民党封建法西斯统治的解放战争中的胜利，正如毛泽东同志所说的，是继十月革命和第二次世界大战胜利后，进步人类的第三个最伟大的胜利。他接着说，这不是偶然的，这是中国人民在毛泽东同志领导下无产阶级国际主义的胜利，是马、恩、列、斯革命理论的胜利。毛主席教导我们：没有全世界的共产党和工人阶级的援助，中国革命是不能胜利的。没有苏联的存在，没有东欧人民民主国家的存在，中国革命是不可能胜利的。
    中共代表致词后，大会代表们和来宾们都热烈地欢呼。哥特瓦尔德、斯兰斯基等主席团的同志们都起立向中共代表伸出兄弟友爱的手。就在同时，来宾席上以马林科夫为首的苏联代表团、意共总书记托格里亚蒂、法共书记马尔梯、英共总书记波立特和德国统一社会党主席皮克等同志，都来和中共代表握手。从较远的席位上走来的南斯拉夫的真正共产主义者的代表，握着中共代表的手说：“感谢毛泽东同志。”这简短的一句话，道出了无限的深意。
    当主席宣布休会后，从南美到北欧，从希腊到西班牙的各国共产党代表们还在和中共代表握手。
