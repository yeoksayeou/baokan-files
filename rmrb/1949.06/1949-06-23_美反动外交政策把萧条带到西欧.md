The statement went on to say: "The foreign policy of the United States is spreading depression to countries whose economies are linked to our own. The deadly bipartisan "Cold War" policy not only fails to restore the economy of Western Europe, but actually brings depression to Europe. The restrictive trade policies implemented by the "Marshall Plan" and the "Cold War" have caused U.S. exports to fall by twenty percent since 1947 (when total exports were over 15.3 billion U.S. dollars). The "Cold War" and economic blockade against the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries have led to increasing unemployment in Western Europe, depriving the United States of vast markets in the Soviet Union, China, and Eastern Europe with their 700 million people.

The statement then emphasized that capitalists have obtained huge profits, with company profits reaching 32 billion U.S. dollars in 1948, accounting for 14 percent of the national income, while in 1929 it only accounted for 11 percent. The percentage of wages and salaries in the national income has fallen even lower. Consumer spending has decreased by 4.5 billion U.S. dollars in the first few months of 1949.

   美反动外交政策把萧条带到西欧
    声明继称：“美国的外交政策正把萧条散布到那些在经济上与我国经济连结在一起的国家。致命的两党一致的“冷战”政策，不仅不能恢复西欧的经济，而且实际上是把萧条带给了欧洲。“马歇尔计划”和“冷战”所实行的限制性的贸易政策，已经使一九四七年（全年出口为一五三亿余美元）以来的美国出口降落了百分之二十。对苏联和各人民民主国家的“冷战”和经济封锁，使得西欧失业日益增加，剥夺了美国在苏联、中国和东欧七亿人民的广大市场。
    声明接着强调指出：资本家获得了巨额的利润，一九四八年公司的利润达到三百二十亿元，占国民收入的百分之十四，而一九二九年还只占百分之十一。工资和薪水在国民收入中的百分比降得更低。消费者的支出在一九四九年头几个月中减少了四十五亿美元。
