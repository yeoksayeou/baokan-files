    Truman Government
    Safeguards Monopoly Capital
    Creates Turmoil and Fear
    The Progressive Party issued a statement condemning Truman's policies for strengthening the power of monopoly capitalism to control the American economy. It pointed out: "Farmers continue to pay peak post-war prices, while the prices they receive for selling agricultural products have fallen by fifteen percent. The price farmers receive for selling wheat decreased by thirty percent in 1948, while the price of bread increased by seven percent (according to April consumer purchases, the farmer's share of each dollar spent on food has fallen to forty-nine cents, the lowest in six years). The Truman government has safeguarded security for monopoly capital and created turmoil and fear for the people."
    The statement said: The expenditure of 22 billion dollars for military and "aid" programs in the coming year (July 1, 1949, to June 30, 1950) will only accelerate the arrival of economic disaster.
    The Progressive Party statement then put forward many suggestions for emergency measures, including immediately and universally increasing wages, extending unemployment insurance payments for all unemployed people, guaranteeing farmers' rights, and formulating public works programs. The statement emphasized: "Finally, we demand an end to the economic blockade of Eastern Europe and China, and the allocation of credit loans to open up new trade. Providing these countries with sufficient loans will bring one million jobs to basic American industries in the coming year."
    The statement concluded: The Progressive Party has decided to convene a national unemployment and anti-depression conference in mid-September to formulate long-term plans.

    杜鲁门政府
    保障了垄断资本安全
    制造了动乱和恐惧
    进步党声明谴责杜鲁门的政策加强了垄断资本主义控制美国经济的力量。并指出：“农民继续在付出战后高峰的物价，他们出卖农产品的价格却跌落了百分之十五。农民出卖小麦的价格一九四八年降低了百分之三十，而面包价格却上涨了百分之七（按四月消费者所购买粮食的每一美元中，农民所得已降至四角九分，这是六年来的最低点。）。杜鲁门政府为垄断资本保障了安全，为人民制造了动乱和恐惧。”
    声明说：来年（一九四九年七月一日至一九五○年六月三十日）的二百二十亿元的军事和“援”外计划的开支，只有加速经济灾祸的到临。
    进步党声明然后提出许多紧急措施的建议，包括立即普遍增资，延长对一切失业者的失业保险付款期，保障农民，制定公共工程计划法等等。声明着重说：“最后我们要求结束对东欧和中国的经济封锁，并拨出信用贷款以打开新的贸易，给这些国家充分的贷款将在来年给美国基本工业带来一百万个工作。”
    声明结束时说：进步党决定在九月中旬召开全国失业与反萧条会议，以制定长期的计划。
