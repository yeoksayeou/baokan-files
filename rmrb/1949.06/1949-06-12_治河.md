　　River Management
　　Wang Kejin
　　“Clang! Clang! Clang! Clang!” Women's Chairperson Zhou Yuying, with her high-pitched voice, loudly called out while striking a gong: “Everyone listen up! Those working on river management, gather at the village office!” She went through the entire village, and at the opera stage, she met Village Chief Liu Daying. The two of them walked towards the village office with the gathering crowd.
　　“Our village has registered eighty-four people for river management, with forty-one being women.” The village chief frowned and then said, “I’m afraid the results won’t be significant!”
　　The Women's Chairperson turned and glared at him, saying unhappily:
　　“Your viewpoint of looking down on women hasn't been corrected!”
　　The village chief felt that Zhou Yuying's criticism was inappropriate and disagreed, replying:
　　“Hey! This isn't a matter of looking down on or valuing women, but rather a competition with the Xishang Village! They have more male laborers; we have fewer. Aren't we going to lose?”
　　“This competition has been discussed by the women in our village. Everyone is confident in winning the banner. Are you sure women are inferior to men?”
　　Just as the village chief was about to argue, he suddenly heard a loud commotion from the village office, startling them both. Not knowing what had happened, they quickly walked towards the village office. Just as they were about to enter the gate, Sister-in-law Xianglin, with her bound feet, ran towards them, grabbed Zhou Yuying's hand, and said in surprise:
　　“Women's Chairperson, look at Sun Si's new bride. She was just married yesterday, and today she's already participating in river repair!”
　　Zhou Yuying leaned on Sister-in-law Xianglin's body and looked into the crowd. She saw the new bride in a red jacket and green pants, carrying a large shovel, standing shyly in the crowd with her head lowered.
　　“This isn’t right! No matter what, she should rest for three days before working! That's the old custom.” Sister-in-law Xianglin said disapprovingly.
　　“I heard the new bride was a labor hero in her maiden home in Changzhuang!” The village chief also expressed his surprise and joy.
　　“Er! Raise your head!”
　　“It really doesn't seem right for a new bride to repair the river!”
　　“Sun Si is so lucky to have married such a capable woman!”
　　The crowd was noisy, some making fun of the new bride, some expressing disapproval, and some admiring the new bride's work ethic. Zhou Yuying felt that this was a good opportunity to motivate the masses, and to relieve the new bride, she quickly beat the gong and shouted:
　　“Attention! Everyone, stop making noise, be quiet!”
　　The enthusiastic scene was shocked by the “Clang! Clang!” gong sound, immediately attracting everyone's attention to Zhou Yuying. Taking advantage of everyone being quiet, she loudly said:
　　“I have some opinions to express. In order to save our land from flooding, more than a dozen villages have united to repair the river. Our village has shown particular enthusiasm. The new bride came to participate the day after her marriage. This is the glory of our women. In the past, superstition caused the river to flood the land every year, leading to ruin. Today, we abandon superstition. Our land will not be flooded, and we will develop production and prosper. The new bride was a labor hero in her maiden home, and she is a labor hero in our village. Everyone should challenge her, not make fun of her. If we fall behind in the competition with Xishang Village, then everyone will be ridiculed!”
　　Among the village cadres, she was known for her eloquence. Today, moved by the new bride's enthusiasm for work, she expressed her opinions in one breath. Seeing that the masses were listening attentively to her speech, she knew that her opinions had been accepted by everyone. She immediately went into the crowd, took the new bride's hand, fulfilled her duty of protection, and expressed her full enthusiasm from the gentle gaze directed at the new bride. The emotions of teasing and criticizing the new bride were transformed into serious admiration, silencing even some of the old-fashioned minds. The village chief was busy gathering the team leaders, counting the number of people, and leading them towards the riverbank. Zhou Yuying also put the new bride in the women's group, kindly holding her hand and following the singing crowd out of the village. She herself was surprised by the new bride's extraordinary enthusiasm for labor and sincerely asked: “You just got married, why didn't you rest for a few days!”
　　“I'm used to working at home. Seeing everyone working, I feel uncomfortable just sitting around!”
　　“You're new to our village and unfamiliar with everything. Don't be too restrained, you'll get used to it slowly!”
　　“I used to be praised for my work. Coming to my husband's family, I'm just afraid of falling behind. Sitting at home as a new bride, I feel shy, but coming out to repair the river also feels inconvenient. It's really difficult!”
　　Their frank conversation brought their hearts closer. Zhou Yuying, like an older sister, said many words of comfort and encouragement to the new bride.
　　Upon arriving at the riverbank, each group began to dig the river沟 in sections. The men dug with their strong, dark arms, stroke after stroke. The women swung their large shovels vigorously, resisting the tough clods of clay. After only a few strokes, they were exhausted, and sweat dripped from their long hair. Zhou Yuying, seeing that the women's group was falling behind the men, worried that her women would be left behind and hurriedly gathered everyone to think of a solution. Yuan Nizi suggested: “First, use livestock to plow up the clods of clay. The soil underneath is loose, so we can dig faster and better.” Everyone agreed with her clever method and brought the livestock and harnessed them to the plow. Zhou Yuying beat the gong and shouted loudly:
　　“＠! Who knows how to plow! Who knows how to plow!”
　　Looking at the hard clods of clay, everyone lost confidence. Cui Gaigai suggested:
　　“Let's ask the men to help us plow!”
　　“Ask the men for help!” Zhou Yuying hesitated with difficulty and then said, “We are still challenging the men!”
　　The new bride, seeing everyone in difficulty, said humbly:
　　“Women's Chairperson! Let me try plowing!”
　　Chang Goujia's mother, never wanting to be left behind, rushed to grab the reins of the livestock and said:
　　“Come! You plow, and I'll pull the livestock for you!”
　　The tall mule pulled forward with a huff, dragging Chang Goujia's mother's body forward, her small feet falling behind her, almost jumping. Behind her, the new bride held the whip in one hand and the plow in the other, steadily and straightly cutting open the large belly of the dry mud. The women cheered and praised their plowing expert, and the men watched the new bride with surprised eyes, praising her in their mouths and working even harder with their hands. Under the gaze of more than a hundred pairs of eyes, the new bride felt a little flustered and flicked the whip to whip the mule, unexpectedly missing and hitting the sore on Chang Goujia's mother's back with the tip of the whip. Chang Goujia's mother felt a sharp, bone-piercing pain in her back and couldn't help but rush up in anger. She threw away the reins and turned around, ready to quarrel. When the new bride in the red jacket and green pants flashed into her eyes, her anger was immediately suppressed by reason.
　　“Auntie! Did I hurt you! I was too careless!” The new bride's face turned red, and she said apologetically.
　　“It's nothing, I was just checking if you were tired!” Chang Goujia's mother said, cracking her mouth in pain and concealing her anger. At this moment, Zhou Yuying immediately rushed over and shouted:
　　“Chang Goujia's mother! You are old, and you have a sore on your back. Don't drive the livestock, let us young people pull the livestock!”
　　Chang Goujia's mother was most afraid of people saying that she was old and useless. She had a strange temper, the more people said she couldn't do it, the more she would fight to do it. Seeing Zhou Yuying rushing over, she turned around, grabbed the reins, and ran forward with the livestock, shouting:
　　“I promise to pull the livestock, I've plowed a lot already, you hurry up and dig the soil!”
　　Seeing that she had already relieved the new bride, Zhou Yuying did not compete to pull the livestock and dug the soil together with everyone. The women's competitive spirit turned into a driving force for the competition. Seeing the new bride showing her skills, everyone worked hard to be a model. Cui Gaigai carried a hundred loads of soil in one breath, Yuan Si'nu carried two hundred and seventy loads before resting. Seeing that she was more of a model than herself, Cui Gaigai went to pick wild vegetables during her rest time to save food, taking care of both famine relief and river repair.
　　The village chief came to inspect and saw that the women were doing better than the men, giving him confidence in winning the competition, and a smile appeared on the corner of his mouth. The Women's Chairperson deliberately said to him:
　　“The women are not doing well, making you worried. Do you have any criticisms?”
　　The village chief knew that she was mocking his lack of faith in women's shortcomings and replied with emotion:
　　“I really admire you all. My mind has realized a truth this time, that the leadership of the Communist Party not only allows us to have good times, but also changes the old life from ancient times. Look at the new bride repairing the river, and women working harder than men. This is because things that are combined with the interests of the masses can show the amazing power of the masses!”

　　治河
    王克锦
    “铛！铛！铛！铛!”妇女主席周玉英敲着铜锣以尖嗓门大声叫着：“大家听着！治河的人都到村公所集合啦！”她转遍整个村子，在戏台跟碰见了村长刘大应，两人就随着集合的人群向村公所走去。
    “咱村报名八十四个人治河，就有四十一个妇女。”村长皱了皱眉头接着说道：“恐怕干起来成绩不大！”
    妇女主席回头瞪了他一眼不高兴的说：
    “你轻视妇女的观点还没有纠正过来！”
    村长感觉周玉英批评得不适当，就不同意的答道：
    “嗨！这不是轻视妇女重视妇女问题，而是和人家西尚村竞赛的问题呀！人家男劳力多、咱村男劳力少，这不是要背乌龟吗？”
    “这次竞赛经过咱村妇女讨论过，大家都有信心得奖旗，你敢肯定女人就比不上男人吗？”
    村长正要辩答时，忽听得村公所里人们轰轰嚷闹起来，把他两都吓了一跳，不知发生了什么事情，就三脚两步向村公所走去。正要进大门时突然祥麟嫂跳着一双半大脚跑到他们面前，一把拉住周玉英的手，就惊怪地说道：
    “妇女主席你看看人家孙四的新媳妇昨天娶进门，今天就来参加修河啦！”
    周玉英靠着祥麟嫂的身子往人丛里一看，见红袄绿裤的新媳妇，扛着大锨低着头羞滴滴地站在人圈中。
    “这不对！无论如何过了三天才能做活呀！这是自古以来的老讲究。”祥麟嫂不同意地说着。
    “听说新媳妇在常庄娘家是个劳动英雄哩！”村长也惊喜的发了言。
    “呃！抬起头来！”
    “新媳妇去修河真不象个话！”
    “孙四真幸运娶来个好干家！”
    人声喧嚷，有的开新媳妇的玩笑，有的表示不赞成，有的对新媳妇的劳动精神羡慕。周玉英感到这是鼓动群众的一个好机会，同时为了给新媳妇解围，就急急打起锣来，口中叫道：
    “注意啦！大家不要闹啦，静一静！”
    热烈的场面，被“铛！铛”锣声一震，把大家的注意力马上吸引在周玉英身上，她趁着大家安静下来的时候，就抓住这一点空隙大声说道：
    “俺有点意见发表，咱们为了救自己的地，不受水淹，十来个村联合起来修河，咱村表现特别紧张，新媳妇过门第二天就来参加，这是咱们妇女的光荣，过去讲迷信年年河淹地，弄得家败人亡，今天咱们抛弃迷信，地不受淹要生产发家，新媳妇在娘家是个劳动英雄，到咱村就是咱村的劳动英雄，大家要跟人家挑战，可不该开人家的玩笑，如果咱跟西尚村竞赛落了后，那大家都要被人家开玩笑哩！”
    周玉英在村干部中，数她能说会道，今天在新媳妇劳动热情的感动下，她一口气发表完自己的意见，看见群众都关心地听她的发言，她知道自己的意见已经被大家接受，就立刻钻进人群，顺手拉住新媳妇的手，尽她保护的义务，把自己满腔的热情，从盯着新媳妇温柔的眼光中流露出来，众人们把对新媳妇打闹斥责的情绪，变成严肃的赞叹，使几个脑筋守旧的人也缄默起来，村长忙着召集组长，点齐人数向河滩带走。周玉英也把新媳妇，编在妇女组内，亲切地拉着她随在谈叫唱歌的人群后面走出村外，她自己也惊奇新媳妇这种不平凡的劳动热情，就诚恳地问道：“你刚过门来，为啥不休息几天！”
    “俺在家是劳动惯了的，看见大家劳动咱闲着怪难受得烦！”
    “你到俺村人生面不熟，不要太拘束，慢慢就惯啦！”
    “俺过去劳动受表扬，来到婆家只怕落了后，坐在家里当新媳妇，自己害羞，出来修河又感到不方便，真是心里作难！”
    她们坦白的谈话，使两颗心更加接近起来，周玉英象个姐姐一样对新媳妇说了许多安慰及鼓励的话。
    到了河滩，各组分段开始挖河沟，男子们以粗壮黑黝的臂膀一下一下挖了下去，妇女们使劲舞动大锨，遭受坚韧的焦泥板的抵抗，挖不几下就累得她们从长发下冒出汗水来，周玉英一看妇女组落在男人们后边，耽心自己妇女们落了后，就急忙召集大家想办法，原妮子主张：“先用牲口把焦泥板犁起来，底下的土松，就能挖的又快又好。”大家都同意她的妙法，就拉来牲口，套上犁，周玉英敲着铜锣大声喊：
    “＠！谁会犁！谁会犁！”
    大家看着硬板板的焦泥地，心中就没了把握，崔改改提议说：
    “请个汉们给咱犁吧！”
    “汉们帮忙！”周玉英为难地迟疑一下接着说：“咱还是跟汉们挑战哩！”
    新媳妇看到大家为了难，就谦逊地说：
    “妇女主席！让俺掌犁试一试！”
    一贯不落人后的常狗家娘，抢着拉住牲口缰绳说：
    “来！你掌犁，俺给你拉牲口！”
    高大的骡子，气呼呼地往前拉，拖得常狗家娘身子俯在前，两只小脚落在后边直奔跳。后头新媳妇一手执鞭一手掌犁，稳稳直直地划开划开干泥的大肚皮。妇女们为自己的掌犁能手欢叫夸耀，男人们以惊奇的眼光，注视着新媳妇，口里赞扬，手里干的就更挂劲。新媳妇在百多只眼睛射击下，心里有点发了慌，飞鞭去抽骡子，想不到失了手将鞭梢子打在常狗家娘背部的疮上。常狗家娘觉着背上一股刺骨的剧痛，忍不住怒往上冲。随手把缰绳一丢，回过头来准备吵架。当红袄绿裤的新媳妇，闪在她眼中时，她的气马上就被理智压了下去。
    “大娘！打痛啦吧！俺太粗心啦！”新媳妇脸一红就惭愧地先开了口。
    “没啥，俺是看你累不累哩！”常狗家娘痛得裂着嘴掩饰住怒气答道。这时周玉英立刻奔过来叫道：
    “常狗家娘！你岁数大啦，背上又长着疮，你不赶上牲口让俺们年青人来拉牲口吧！”
    常狗家娘最怕人家说她年老不顶事，她有股怪皮气，越说她不行，越要争着干，她看着周玉英奔过来，就转身抢住缰绳拉着牲口往前窜，口中嚷道：
    “俺包拉牲口，已经犁过不少啦，你们赶紧挖土吧！”
    周玉英见已经解了新媳妇的围，就不去争着拉牲口，和大家一同挖起土来，妇女们的好胜心，变成竞赛的推动力，大家看见新媳妇显本领，就都努力争模范，崔改改一口气担了一百担土，原四女担了二百七十担才休息，崔改改一看她比自己更模范，就在休息时间去采野菜，节省粮食，渡荒修河两不误。
    村长过来检查，见妇女们干得比男人们还强，使他抓住了竞赛胜利的把握，嘴角上就露出笑纹来，妇女主席故意的对他说道：
    “妇女们干得成绩不大，使你不放心，有啥意见批评吧！”
    村长知道是刺他不相信妇女的缺点，便感叹地答道：
    “俺真信服了你们啦，俺的脑筋这次悟出了一个道理来，就是共产党领导，不只使咱们过好时光，并且改变了自古以来的旧生活，你们看新媳妇修河，妇女劳动起来赛过男人，这是因为和群众利益结合的事情，就能显出群众的惊人力量来！”    （附图片）
