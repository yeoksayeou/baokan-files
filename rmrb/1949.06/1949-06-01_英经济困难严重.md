Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, May 30th: Growing unease is enveloping Britain due to severe economic difficulties. Shawcross, speaking in Stafford on May 27th, described the sharp decline in exports in April as a "dangerous symptom" that everyone should see. "The Economist" wrote: "Years of hardship have arrived," and pointed out that the quantity of demand for goods is declining, "If nothing can be done, the plunge will not be limited to exports alone."
    The Labor government's attempt to shift the burden of economic hardship onto the working class has aroused resistance from British workers. TASS quoted statistics recently published in the British Ministry of Labor's official publication, "Ministry of Labor Gazette," stating that there were a total of 1,759 officially registered strike cases in Britain in 1948, 38 more than in 1947. A total of 426,000 people were involved in the strikes. Of the 1,759 strike cases last year, 1,116 were participated in by miners, ten times more than in other industrial sectors. There were 111 strikes in the transportation industry and 100 in the steel and other metallurgical industries.

　　英经济困难严重
    【新华社北平三十日电】据塔斯社伦敦讯：由于严重的经济困难，日益增长的不安正笼罩着英国，萧克洛斯五月二十七日在斯塔福演说时，描述四月份出口的严重下降是每个人都应看到的“危险的象征”。“经济学家”周刊写道：“困苦的年月到来了”，该刊指出对商品需求的数量正在下降，“如果不能有所作为，则暴跌的将不只是限于出口一项”。
    工党政府想把经济困难的重负转嫁到工人阶级身上，引起了英国工人的反抗。塔斯社引英国劳工部机关刊物“劳工部公报”最近发表的统计数字称，一九四八年经过英国官方登记的罢工案件，共有一千七百五十九起，较一九四七年多三十八起。卷入罢工的人数共四十二万六千名。去年的一千七百五十九起罢工案中，矿工参加的就有一千一百一十六起。为其他工业部门的十倍。运输业中发生罢工一百一十一起，炼钢工业及其他冶金工业一百起。
