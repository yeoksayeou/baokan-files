　　Today, the working masses joyfully celebrate the Second Trade Union Congress held in the newly reborn Poland. This congress is a great victory for the Polish working class. It is a new victory for the unity of the working people, and the manifestation and political symbol of this unity is the historic congress of the Polish United Workers' Party last December. The December congress was a manifestation of the victory of the working class's thought, a manifestation of the unity of purpose and long-cherished aspirations, and the victory of the highest thought and the highest ideal, whose name is socialism.

　　The December congress was a great act of unity of the vanguard of the Polish people, illuminating the path of development of the newly reborn Republic of Poland. Today's congress is a victory for the solidarity of the Polish working-class organizations, and a manifestation of the broadest unity of all manual and intellectual laborers. But the special importance of today's congress is not only determined by the three million six hundred thousand organized trade union members you represent. Naturally, in our environment, this is a large number, and four times that of before the war. The weakness of the pre-war trade union movement was not only due to the small number of members, but also to serious ideological divisions. The strength of trade unions lies not only in their numbers, but primarily in the characteristics of trade union work and its new role in production, in the state, and in society under the completely new conditions of our political, social, and economic system.

　　The fact that the working class today holds state power and is the true master of the most basic sectors of the national economy has a decisive impact on trade unions. This has brought about essential changes in the characteristics, role, and tasks of today's labor movement compared to the period of capitalist rule. The basic factors that have promoted these changes are: the people's state power led by the working class and based on the worker-peasant alliance, the social ownership of the main means of production that were originally the property of capitalists and landlords, the planned economy based on a new economic foundation, and the new guiding role of the people's state in the entire national economy.

　　The special importance of the Trade Union Congress lies in the fact that it should clearly define the tasks and further development direction of the trade union movement based on the new conditions of the system in which our laboring masses live today, and based on the experience of our achievements and efforts over the past four years. The congress should strengthen and further enhance the ideological and organizational unity of the laboring masses who join trade unions. Non-Party workers and intellectuals constitute the overwhelming majority of trade unions. During the period of capitalist government, they participated in trade unions to defend themselves against the increasing exploitation by factory owners, and to fight for basic rights—the eight-hour workday, preliminary social insurance—to fight against unemployment, against the savage and arbitrary power of employers used to maintain the miserable living standards of workers, and the living standards of workers often continuously lowered due to the greed of exploiters, crises and unemployment, and the greedy policies of the bourgeois government. At this time, the revolutionary party said to the laboring masses: Do not shrink from organizing struggle, but never forget that your difficult economic conditions are closely linked to your political situation, that is, to the power of capitalists and landlords. Without abolishing this kind of power, it is impossible to achieve any fundamental and lasting change in the difficult material, political, and economic conditions of the laboring masses.

　　No conscious non-Party worker would doubt that the attitude of the revolutionary Marxist party, which closely links the struggle for the daily economic interests of the laboring masses with the struggle to overthrow the capitalist system, is the only correct attitude. Now that the capitalist and landlord regime in Poland has been destroyed, although our country has suffered enormous destruction left by the Nazi invaders, the political, material, and cultural conditions of the laboring people are being systematically improved.

　　波兰总统贝鲁特在波兰职工会代表大会上的演说
    今天劳动群众愉快地庆祝在新生的波兰举行的第二届职工会代表大会。这次大会是波兰工人阶级的伟大胜利。这是劳动人民统一的新胜利，这个统一的表现与政治象征，就是去年十二月波兰统一工人党的历史性的大会。十二月大会是工人阶级思想的胜利的表现，是目的与夙愿的统一的表现，是最高的思想和最高理想的胜利，这一理想的名字就是社会主义。
    十二月大会，是波兰人民的先锋队统一的伟大行动，它照明了新生的波兰共和国发展的道路。今天的大会是波兰工人阶级组织团结的胜利，是一切体力和智力劳动人民最广泛团结的表现。但是今天大会的特别的重要性，不仅决定于你们所代表的三百六十万有组织的职工会会员。自然，在我们的环境中，这是一个大数目，而且为战前的四倍。战前职工会运动之所以软弱，不仅由于会员数目的微小，而且也是由于严重的思想上的分裂。职工会的力量不仅在于它们的数目，并且首先便是在于在我们政治、社会和经济制度的完全新的条件之下，职工会工作的特性及其在生产、在国家和在社会中的新作用。
    今天工人阶级掌握着国家大权，并且是国民经济的最基本部门的真正主人，这一事实对于职工会，具有决定性的作用。这使今天职工运动的特性、作用和任务，较之资本主义统治时期，已有了本质的变化。促成这些变化的基本因素是：工人阶级领导的、以工农联盟为基础的、人民国家政权，原为资本家和地主财产的主要生产手段的社会占有，基于新的经济基础的计划经济，人民国家在整个国民经济中的新的指导作用。
    职工代表大会的特别的重要性在于：大会应以我国劳动人民群众今天所生活的制度的新条件，以及以四年来我们的成就与努力的经验为基础，明白地规定职工运动的任务和进一步发展的方针。大会应加强与更加提高加入职工会的劳动群众底思想和组织的统一。非党的工人和知识分子成份占职工会的压倒多数。在资本主义政府时期，他们参加职工会来保卫他们自己以反对厂主日益增大的剥削，和为争取基本权利——八小时工作日、初步的社会保险——而斗争，为反对失业、反对雇主用以维持工人悲惨的生活水平的野蛮的和专横的权力而斗争，而工人的生活水平常因剥削者的贪欲、危机与失业，因资产阶级政府的贪婪的政策而不断降低。革命的政党此时对劳动群众说：组织斗争不要退缩，但一刻也不要忘记你们困难的经济条件是与你们的政治情况，即与资本家和地主政权紧密地联系着。不废止这种政权，就不可能使劳动群众困难的物质、政治和经济情况达到任何基本的和持久的改变。
    没有任何一个自觉的非党工人会怀疑：把争取劳动群众日常经济利益的斗争，与推翻资本主义制度的斗争紧密地联系在一起的革命的马克思主义政党的态度，是唯一正确的态度。现在，当波兰的资本家和地主政权已被摧毁之后，虽然我国有纳粹侵略者遗留下来的巨大的破坏，但劳动人民的政治。物质与文化条件却正在有系统地改善中。（未完）
