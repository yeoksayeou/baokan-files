    Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 20th - Tokyo dispatch: The Japanese working class's struggle against the massive dismissal of workers by American and Japanese reactionaries is growing in scale. 26,000 workers from 48 factories nationwide of Tokyo Shibaura Electric Company have been on a 48-hour strike since the morning of the 18th. The strike is to protest the capital side's large-scale dismissal of workers according to the American occupiers' "enterprise adjustment" order. In Hiroshima, the strike by workers at the Japan Steel Corporation factory to oppose the mass dismissal of workers is still ongoing. After the striking workers at the factory were subjected to violent suppression by the Japanese police on the 15th, 4,000 workers from other factories throughout Hiroshima City held mass demonstrations to show solidarity with the striking workers at the factory and protest the police brutality. After the demonstration, 1,000 worker representatives went to the workers' dormitory of the Hiroshima Steel Works and kept watch all night alongside the strikers to prevent the police from expelling the strikers from the dormitory. Among railway workers, although strikers in Tokyo and Kanagawa Prefecture carried out the occupation authorities' reactionary order to stop the strike on the 11th, the anger of the workers is growing. "Tense emotions are presenting an explosive and uneasy future, threatening to disrupt the national railway system at any moment" (Agence France-Presse). In addition, the National Communications (Transportation) Workers' Union, which has 400,000 members, issued a "struggle order" to its branches nationwide on the 17th to oppose the government's mass dismissal of workers in accordance with the so-called "administrative adjustment" plan. The union's directive stated: All unions should strengthen regional cooperation under the general goals of overthrowing the Yoshida Cabinet and opposing the "New Public Security Law."

    日本罢工扩大
    【新华社北平二十日电】东京消息：日本工人阶级反对美日反动派大量解雇工人的斗争，规模愈来愈大。东京芝浦电气公司全国四十八个厂的工人两万六千人，已自十八日晨起举行四十八小时罢工。罢工是为了抗议资方根据美国占领者的“企业调整”命令，大批解雇工人。在广岛，日本钢铁公司工厂工人为反对大批解雇工人而举行的罢工，仍在坚持中。全广岛市的其他工厂的四千名工人，在该厂罢工工人于十五日遭到日本警察的武力镇压后，即举行了群众示威，声援该厂罢工工人，抗议警察的暴行。在示威之后，一千名工人代表，曾至广岛制钢厂的工人宿舍，与罢工者并肩澈夜值守，以阻止警察从宿舍中驱逐罢工者。在铁路工人中，东京与神奈川县的罢工者，虽然于十一日执行了占领当局的停止罢工的反动指令，但工人的愤怒正在增长。“紧张的情绪正呈现爆炸的不安前途，时刻有使全国铁道系统陷于紊乱之虞”（法新社）。此外，拥有四十万会员的全国递信（交通）工人工会，已于十七日向其全国各分会发出“斗争令”，反对政府依照所谓“行政调整”计划，大批解雇工人。工会指令说：各工会要在推翻吉田内阁、反对“新治安法”等总的目标下，加强区域合作。
