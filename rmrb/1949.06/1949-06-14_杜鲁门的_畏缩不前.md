Editor's Notes

　　Truman's "Shrinking Back"
    In his foreign policy speech in Little Rock, Truman clamored with two old-tune aggressive plans. One was to "eliminate special tariff barriers," demanding that Britain open its doors wider for further invasion by American capital. The other was to "develop backward areas," seeking wider outlets for the commodities and capital of American monopoly capitalists. When Truman played these old tunes, what differed from the past was the lower tone. Faced with the inevitable arrival of the American economic crisis and under the pressure of the surging and growing world movement to defend peace, he had no choice but to weakly shout: "We must not shrink back now."

　　杜鲁门的“畏缩不前”
    杜鲁门在小石城发表的外交演说，叫嚣出两个旧调重弹的侵略计划，一个是“取消特殊的关税壁垒”，要英国把门开得更大些，以便美国资本更进一步的入侵；另一个是“开发落后地区”，为美国独占资本家的商品及资本寻找更广的出路。在杜鲁门弹出这两个老调子时，和以前相异的，是带着低音的调子了。他在美国经济危机必然到来的面前，在世界保卫和平运动汹涌壮大的压力下，只好有气无力地叫出了：“我们现在决不能畏缩不前”。
