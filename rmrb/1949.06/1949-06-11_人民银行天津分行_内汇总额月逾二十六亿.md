　　People's Bank of China Tianjin Branch
  　Internal Remittance Exceeds 2.6 Billion Monthly
    [Tianjin News] The internal remittance business of the Tianjin People's Bank is developing rapidly. The total amount of remittances sent and received last month reached 2,640 million yuan. The bank's internal remittance business began in late January of this year. At that time, due to the recent stabilization of social order and the lack of large-scale trade in various places, only sixteen places, including Baoding and Cangxian, were connected for remittances by the end of February. The total number of remittances sent and received was only about 800, including nearly 30 million yuan remitted out and more than 33 million yuan remitted in. In March, business travelers from various places increased daily, and trade gradually developed. The number of remittance points increased to 26, including Beijing, Jinan, Zhangjiakou, Shijiazhuang, and Tangshan. A total of 2,255 remittances were sent and received throughout the month, with more than 227 million yuan remitted out and more than 148 million yuan remitted in. By April, the number of remittances sent and received increased to 3,672, with remittances out increasing to more than 965 million yuan and remittances in increasing to more than 388 million yuan. By May, the number of remittances sent and received reached more than 4,000, with remittances out increasing to more than 1.8 billion yuan and remittances in increasing to more than 840 million yuan. The rapid development of the internal remittance business is mainly due to: (1) The opening of material exchanges in various places, the resumption of work in factories in the city is increasing daily, requiring the purchase of raw materials from surrounding areas, and farmers in the countryside need to come to the city to purchase daily necessities. As a result, the joint ventures in various small and medium-sized cities receive daily agreements or letters requesting the establishment of remittance connections. (2) Government agencies, state-owned enterprises, and trade departments need to allocate funds due to work needs or business expansion, and enterprises and factories also urgently require remittances for purchasing raw materials and paying wages.

　　人民银行天津分行
  　内汇总额月逾二十六亿
    【天津讯】天津人民银行内汇业务迅速发展，上月份汇出汇入总数达二十六亿四千余万元。该行内汇业务，开始于今年一月下旬，当时由于社会秩序甫告稳定，各地贸易未大量开展，故到二月底止，仅有保定、沧县等十六处通汇，汇出汇入总计只有八百来笔，包括汇出近三千万，汇入三千三百余万。到了三月份，各地商旅往来日多，贸易逐渐开展，通汇点增加北平、济南、张家口、石家庄、唐山等处，共为二十六处，全月汇出汇入二千二百五十五笔，汇出二亿二千七百余万元，汇入一亿四千八百余万元；至四月份，汇出汇入笔数更增至三千六百七十二笔，汇出增至九亿六千五百余万元，汇入增至三亿八千八百余万元；至五月份汇出汇入笔数达到四千余笔，汇出增至十八亿余元，汇入增至八亿四千余万元。内汇业务迅速发展的原因，主要是：（一）各地物资交流打开，本市工厂复工日有增加，要到四外采办原料，四乡农民要进城采办日用品，因之每日都接到各中小城市联行要求建立通汇的协议书或信件。（二）机关公营企业贸易部门或因工作需要或因业务扩展，款项需要调拨，企业工厂也因买原料、发工资而迫切要求通汇。
