　　【Our Newspaper Dispatches】The North China People's Government organized a staff training class to strengthen the political study of newly joined staff members, and held an opening ceremony at the Zhongshan Park Music Hall at 6 p.m. on the 5th. More than 4,300 new staff members from units affiliated with the North China People's Government, including the General Office, Ministry of Finance, Ministry of Justice, Ministry of Education, Ministry of Agriculture, Ministry of Industry and Commerce, Ministry of Enterprise, Ministry of Transportation, Ministry of Civil Affairs, Finance Committee, Culture Committee, Military Committee, Water Conservancy Committee, Supervisory Yuan, Court, and Bank, attended. Vice Chairman Lan Gongwu and Minister of Justice Xie Juezai delivered speeches. Vice Chairman Lan hoped that everyone would overcome several misunderstandings about learning, such as some people thinking that being trained is not honorable, and others believing that they have specialized skills and knowledge, and therefore have low enthusiasm for political study. These understandings are incorrect and should be corrected. He said: Everyone must establish the idea and viewpoint of serving the people, and recognize that the actual revolutionary work is arduous, so we must study hard. Minister Xie Juezai called on everyone to promote the spirit of mutual assistance, mutual teaching, mutual learning, and criticism and self-criticism, to study learning methods, improve learning viewpoints, and correct learning attitudes, in order to establish a new democratic revolutionary outlook on life and a diligent, hardworking, honest, and clean work style.

　　工作人员训练班举行开学典礼
    【本报讯】华北人民政府为加强新参加工作人员的政治学习而组织的工作人员训练班，于五日下午六时在中山公园音乐堂举行开学典礼。到有华北人民政府所属秘书厅、财政部、司法部、教育部、农业部、工商部、企业部、交通部、民政部、财委会、文委会、武委会、水委会、监察院、法院、银行等单位新参加工作人员四千三百余人，蓝公武副主席，司法部谢觉哉部长均出席讲话，蓝副主席希望大家克服对学习的几点误解，如有的人认为受训是不光荣的，又有的人认为自己有专门技术专门知识，因而对政治学习情绪不高。这些认识都是不对的，应当纠正。他说：大家必须建立为人民服务的思想和观点，要认识实际的革命工作是艰巨的，所以要努力学习。谢觉哉部长号召大家发扬互助互教互学及批评与自我批评的精神。研究学习的方法，改进学习的观点，端正学习态度，以建立新民主主义革命的人生观及勤苦廉洁的作风。
