Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, May 5th (via Warsaw): The third day (the 3rd) of the Polish Trade Union Congress's meeting began with Kurilowicz reporting the results of the representative qualification review: a total of 1,803 representatives were elected, of which 1,799 are currently participating in the congress. Among the representatives, 1,098 are workers and 621 are staff members. There are 378 women representatives. 268 representatives have been promoted to leadership positions. 497 representatives are model workers.

The first speaker on the third day of the congress was Pawlicka. She was the first female worker in the railway carriage factory to participate in the labor competition. She said that she had reached 140% of the new quota and that other women were also approaching this efficiency. She represents 1,000 female metalworkers in Wrocław and requested better organization of nurseries and women's healthcare.

The next speaker was Kuroczko, Secretary-General of the Teachers' Union. He pointed out that the union had 55 representatives attending the congress, and that the union, together with the working class and other fraternal unions, demonstrated a strength that had not been seen in the 44 years since the union's establishment. He said that the most important task of the Teachers' Union at present is to improve the political awareness of teachers.

Barilla, Chairman of the Construction Workers' Union, described the achievements of the labor competition involving more than 100,000 union members. At the same time, he criticized a tendency among some trade union officials in his sector to engage in trade union work in the comfort of office armchairs, detached from the masses of workers.

Światło, a representative of the Polish Youth Union, emphasized when talking about vocational training that a large number of the 100,000 technicians and 20,000 engineers needed to implement Poland's Six-Year Plan must be promoted from the ranks of young workers and model workers. Therefore, it is necessary to open a number of schools so that young workers can combine work and study. In view of the recent expansion of the Polish Youth Union (with nearly one million members), Światło also proposed dissolving the youth workers' department of the trade union in order to allow the masses of workers who have joined the Polish Youth Union and the trade union organizations in enterprises to have closer ties.

　　波工代大会第三日
  　代表分别报告工作
    资格审查结果工人代表过半数
    【新华社北平五日电】华沙讯：波兰职工会代表大会第三日（三日）的会议，首先由库里洛维兹报告代表资格审查的结果：当选的代表共一千八百零三名，其中一千七百九十九人现正参加大会工作。代表中有一千零九十八人是工人，六百二十一人是职员。有三百七十八名是妇女代表。代表中有二百六十八人已被提升到领导职位。四百九十七名代表是劳动优胜者。
    第三日大会的第一个发言者是巴夫利茨卡。她是铁路车厢工厂第一个参加劳动竞赛的女工，她说，她达到了新定额的百分之一百四十，并且其他妇女也正接近这个效率。她代表罗克劳一千名五金女工，要求更好地组织托儿所及妇女保健。
    接着讲话的是教师工会总书记库罗茨科，他指出：该工会有五十五名代表出席大会，该工会与工人阶级及各兄弟工会在一起表现了这样的力量，这在该工会成立四十四年以来尚属首次。他说：教师工会目前最重要的任务，便是提高教师的政治水平。
    建筑工人工会主席巴里拉讲述有十余万工会会员参加的劳动竞赛所达到的成就，同时，并批评他那行职工会中有时有一种在办公室的安乐椅上进行工会工作的脱离工人群众的倾向。
    波兰青年联盟代表斯威特洛在谈到职业训练时力称，实行波兰六年计划所需要的十万技师与二万工程师，其中必须有很大的一批由青年工人与劳动优胜者的队伍中提拔起来，因此，必须开办若干学校，使青年工人能够把工作与学习结合起来。鉴于最近波兰青年联盟的扩大（其盟员几达一百万），斯威特洛并提出解散职工会青工部的建议，以便加入波兰青年联盟的工人群众与企业中的工会组织，有可能取得更密切的联系。
