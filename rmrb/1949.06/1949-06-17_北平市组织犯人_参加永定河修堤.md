　　Peiping City Organizes Prisoners
    To Participate in Yongding River Embankment Repair
    [Peiping News] The Yongding River has suffered from disrepair for many years during the period of Japanese puppet rule, resulting in collapsed river embankments and numerous dangerous sections, especially in the Changxindian section. After liberation, under the guidance of the North China People's Government's Water Conservancy Committee, embankment and dam repair work is currently underway. However, as it is currently the wheat harvesting season, the Peiping Municipal People's Government, in order to take care of the local people's wheat harvesting, decided to organize a labor brigade of 101 prisoners from the Peiping Municipal Court Detention Center. The Correction General Team will send personnel to serve as middle-level squad leaders and team leaders, and Comrade Ma Xiao from the Civil Affairs Bureau will lead them to participate in the Changxindian embankment repair work. Before departure, the president of the court gave a speech, encouraging them to atone for their crimes through good deeds, strive to complete the embankment repair work, and transform themselves through labor. Everyone was in high spirits and took the early train to Changxindian on the 10th of this month. (Dong Ruqin)

　　北平市组织犯人
    参加永定河修堤
    【平市讯】永定河因在日伪统治时期年久失修，致河堤跌塌，险工很多，尤以长辛店一段为甚。解放后，在华北人民政府水利委员会指导下，现正进行扶堤修坝工作。惟现值麦收时期，北平市人民政府为照顾当地群众收麦起见，决定由平市地方法院看守所犯人中组织一○一人之劳动大队，由纠察总队派人任中分队长及班长，由民政局马啸同志率领参加长辛店修堤工作。行前法院院长亲临讲话，勉以戴罪立功，努力完成修堤工作，从劳动中改造自己。大家情绪很高，于本月十日乘早车去长辛店。　　　　　　　　　　　　（董汝勤）
