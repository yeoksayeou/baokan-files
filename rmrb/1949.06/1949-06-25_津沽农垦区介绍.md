Introduction to the Tianjin-Gugu Reclamation Area
		Wu Guangtang

I. The Agricultural Reclamation History of the Tianjin-Gugu Area

		The Tianjin-Gugu Reclamation Area, formerly known as the Changlu Salt Reclamation Area, is located along the Bohai Sea, stretching from Shanhaiguan in the north to the mouth of the Yellow River in the south. Except for the coastal areas reserved for salt production, the area available for improved cultivation amounts to 4,196,300 mu. The area is traversed by three major rivers, the Luan River, the Jiyun River, and the Hai River, as well as the South and North Grand Canals and many other tributaries. With the Beijing-Shenyang and Tianjin-Pukou Railways, and the Tianjin-Yu, Tianjin-Ping, and Tianjin-Yan Highways, the area boasts a superior location, flat terrain, convenient transportation, and abundant water supply, making it a highly promising area for reclamation.

		The aforementioned reclamation efforts began in the twelfth year of the Guangxu reign (1886), when Li Hongzhang used retired Huai Army soldiers to dig canals and plant rice in Xiaozhan (Xiaozhan rice is named after this). After the Japanese invaders occupied North China, they saw this area as a source of profit. In 1941, they established the puppet North China Reclamation Corporation, seizing existing public lands and forcibly purchasing private lands at low prices. They constructed water conservancy projects and initially developed eight agricultural zones: Jidong, Lutai, Junliangcheng, Zhangguizhuang, Jinbei, Xiaozhan, Xianshuigu, and the outskirts of Tianjin, encompassing 136 farms, with a planned reclamation area of over 1,160,000 mu. Among these, the cultivated area included over 237,000 mu of paddy fields and over 100,700 mu of dry land, totaling 344,000 mu of reclaimed land. They also built large-scale mechanized rice mills, rice oil extraction plants, and rice straw rope factories to process by-products.

		After the Japanese surrender in 1945, the area was taken over by the Kuomintang bandits. The central and local authorities fought for control and profit, dividing the aforementioned reclamation system into fragments. The puppet Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry established the Hebei Reclamation Farm Management Office, which administered six agricultural zones: Junliangcheng, Zhangguizhuang, Xiaozhan, Balitai, Chadian, and Huangcun. The puppet Hebei Provincial Department of Construction established the Hebei Provincial Farmland Bureau, which also administered nine agricultural zones: Junliangcheng, Zhangguizhuang, Xiaozhan, Balitai, Jinjiao, Zhonghe, and additionally established a "Refugee" (fleeing landlords) cooperative farm in Chadian. These overlapping bureaucratic structures were merely nominal and lacked effective management, resulting in a significant decline in performance compared to the past. Furthermore, the local masses deeply resented the Japanese and puppet regimes, and took the opportunity to carry out sabotage. Except for Junliangcheng and Zhangguizhuang, most of the farm equipment was destroyed. Immigration residences and water lifting equipment in Lutai, Chadian, and Shanglujuan were completely destroyed.

II. Restoration Work After Liberation

		After the liberation of Tianjin, the aforementioned reclamation institutions were taken over by the North China People's Government's Department of Agriculture. First, redundant institutions were merged, and the Tianjin-Gugu Area Agricultural Reclamation Administration was established to unify leadership and actively engage in restoration work. According to current statistics, this year's planting area has reached 233,497 mu, exceeding the planting area during the Kuomintang's management period by 39% and reaching 67% of the planting area during the Japanese occupation. If the weather conditions are favorable, in addition to the benefits for the masses, it is expected that around 20 million catties of rice can be obtained. They have also undertaken a larger annual repair project this year than any year under the Kuomintang, repairing the projects in Junliangcheng and Zhangguizhuang that the Kuomintang never repaired. In Jidong, Lutai and in Jizhong, Xiaozhan, have also mobilized significant manpower to carry out repair work. The Ministry of Agriculture has also organized water conservancy engineering teams to assist in surveying Gaoliquan, Chadian, Lutai and other places in preparation for continued restoration. In addition, loans have been provided this year to purchase over 10 million catties of soybean cake to lend to farmers. As a result, farmers are extremely excited and actively participating in the restoration work.

III. Operation and Management

		The purpose of the Japanese colonial management was primarily to supply military rice, using brutal rule to control and exploit the masses. All rice harvests had to be handed over to the Japanese puppets, who then allocated a small amount of coarse grains and coarse cloth to the farmers. The exploitation was extremely harsh, with the farmers' allocation often not exceeding 50%. After repaying loans for fertilizer and seeds, the farmers' income barely exceeded 30% of their labor earnings. At the same time, in order to facilitate the rule and oppression of farmers, the Japanese often leased the land to local powerful landlords and rich peasants, who subleased it to farmers and exploited them. Because farmers were subjected to multiple layers of exploitation by the Japanese puppets and secondary landlords, although rice yields increased annually (good land yielded 800 catties, with an average of 400 catties), they were still unable to escape poverty. After reclaiming and planting rice for seven or eight years, they still lacked the ability to reinvest in production and could not proceed with production without loans for fertilizer and seeds.

		After we took over, for the reclaimed land, we adopted the method of distributing the land to the masses for cultivation, with the farm carrying out water conservancy projects and constructing water lifting equipment. Based on the principle of benefiting both public and private interests, we are studying reasonable and scientific profit-sharing methods to recover water and electricity costs and management expenses from the masses. The method involves reasonable distribution of the harvest (with all by-products going to the farmers) based on land quality, labor and livestock requirements, fertilizer and seed investment, as well as water lifting costs, annual repair projects, machinery depreciation, and management needs. The draft of the aforementioned profit-sharing method has been prepared and is currently being solicited from local farmers. After revision, it will be implemented on a trial basis this year.

		In addition to the above-mentioned areas distributed to the masses for operation, the vast uncultivated wasteland is now planned by the Ministry of Agriculture to establish state-owned farms, maintain large tracts of land, use tractors for cultivation, and install electric water lifting systems, using modern management methods for large-scale operation. In areas where wasteland belongs to private ownership, cooperative farms will be established on a trial basis. The state will provide water conservancy equipment and use tractors for cultivation, collecting a certain amount of fees. Under the principle of voluntary participation by the masses, they will be organized to cultivate together. State-owned farms will serve as the center, mutually supporting the cooperative farms, forming a new type of agricultural economic system, and drawing on experience for typical demonstrations. Ten tractors have already been delivered and are planned to be used on a trial basis in Gaoliquan. For example, Gaoliquan's housing construction is divided into thirty-four sections. Apart from the central section for farm offices, the other thirty-three sections each house thirty-two households, with each plot of land measuring 300 mu, making it suitable for using advanced tools. Other aspects, such as road connections, waterway organization, and power supply equipment, are also relatively reasonable. However, the management setup in some agricultural zones is not very scientific. In particular, some farmers, in order to adapt to their small plots of land, arbitrarily dig ditches for water diversion, or damage the channels in order to adapt to the use of dragon bone waterwheels for water lifting. Some local cadres even advocate dividing large tracts of farmland among farmers, or renting out whole pieces of reeds to the masses for decentralized operation, which is inappropriate and should be overcome immediately.

		The scope of operation focuses on desalinization and rice planting, with dry farming or crop rotation being carried out where water is insufficient. It also includes sideline businesses such as reeds, orchards, sunflowers, fishing, and animal husbandry, gradually developing agricultural and sideline processing and manufacturing to become a complete and modern agricultural operation.

		The management institutions and methods of the enemy and puppet era were mainly for the convenience of rule in order to achieve their purpose of oppressing farmers. After we took over, it was completely the opposite, focusing on how to facilitate leading the masses, developing production, and truly implementing the principle of democratic management. At the same time, through democratic management, the enthusiasm of the masses is gradually inspired, farmers are educated with the ability to use scientific and technological skills, and farmers are gradually organized to manage water lifting, water usage, waterways, and the use of new agricultural tools themselves. In terms of supply and marketing, the old cooperatives that exploited farmers and engaged in embezzlement are also being transformed to establish cooperatives that truly serve farmers, responsible for promoting rice sales, supplying coarse grains, and organizing sideline production and promoting sideline products. The intention is to gradually develop the supply of fertilizer and improved rice seeds to farmers, and handle agricultural loans on behalf of the government. In addition, they are planning to establish larger supply and marketing cooperatives, intending to use economic strength to support the development of the aforementioned cooperatives.

IV. Development Prospects and Issues Requiring Immediate Resolution

		The coastal area of the Bohai Sea has a total of over 4 million mu of arable land (the pre-reclamation area demarcated by the Japanese reached over 1.1 million mu). Taking 3 million mu as the reclamation area, with half of the land being paddy fields and the other half being dry land, annual grain production could increase by 900 million catties. The coastal area is vast and sparsely populated, with insufficient labor. In addition to the local farmers who can cultivate part of it, it is also necessary to relocate 60,000 to 100,000 laborers. If military forces are stationed for agricultural reclamation, it can accommodate at least 200,000 people. However, with the current limitations of human, material, and technical conditions, it is difficult to reclaim all of it at once. It is necessary to proceed in stages, according to the principle of tackling the easier tasks first, with a plan. The first phase aims to fully restore and reclaim the over 1 million mu of wasteland that has been pre-reclaimed in the past. In addition to the 230,000 mu already planted this year, the focus of restoration is on Gaoliquan and Lutai Farms No. 1 to No. 8, and the Chadian Cooperative Farm. It is estimated that the completion of the aforementioned projects can increase paddy fields by 110,000 mu. Next year, it is planned to reclaim 220,000 mu in five locations: Renfengzhuang, Boge Zhuang, Yangliuqing, Huanghua, and Zhangguizhuang in the suburbs of Tianjin. In the third year, development and reclamation will continue in the aforementioned locations, with an additional 380,000 mu. Together with the wasteland that can still be restored on existing farms, the reclaimed land can reach over 1 million mu after three years. If human and material resources are sufficient, the plan can be advanced.

		To complete the aforementioned reclamation plan, it is necessary to conduct thorough investigation and research, and make adequate preparations immediately, such as:

		First, the experimental research on alkaline land improvement. This is a more difficult and complex task in agriculture. It is also very important in agricultural production in North China. Currently, there are over 9.7 million mu of alkaline land in the North China region. If all of it can be studied, improved and utilized, a large amount of production can be increased. Desalinization and rice planting in the Tianjin-Gugu area has a typical role and must concentrate alkaline land improvement experts to study the settings, in order to avoid failure. Currently, the Junliangcheng workstation led by the Tianjin-Gugu Area Agricultural Reclamation Administration is dedicated to experimental research on alkaline land improvement, breeding of improved rice varieties, and pest control, etc., and its work should be strengthened.

		Second, water conservancy projects are also a major link in agricultural reclamation in this area. Water diversion for irrigation should be combined with flood control and river management, and combined with the elimination of standing water (such as in Huanghua, etc.). There must be a sufficient number of water conservancy engineers, and those with higher technical qualifications must preside over the design and make overall plans to avoid being passive or carrying out piecemeal construction, resulting in losses.

		Third, there is also an extreme shortage of existing management talent. Creating state-owned farms and cooperative farms using advanced technology are new undertakings. To enable this endeavor to develop effectively, this talent must be trained and nurtured.

		Fourth, the planning and research on developing sideline businesses must also be carried out simultaneously. According to different conditions, it is necessary to do appropriate regional division of labor as much as possible. Reeds, fish ponds, sunflowers, orchards, etc., must all be surveyed and studied before delineating development zones. Sideline product processing should also be organized, such as making rice straw ropes, making grass bags, rice oil extraction, and fish product processing. There is already a considerable foundation, which should be restored and gradually expanded.

    津沽农垦区介绍
    武光汤
    一、津沽区农垦沿革
    津沽农垦区，即旧日所谓长芦盐垦区，位于渤海沿岸，北迄山海关，南抵黄河口。除近海地区留作盐地外，可以改良耕作之面积达四百一十九万六千三百市亩，区内有滦河、蓟运河、海河三大河流与南、北运河及其他许多支流。交通有北宁、津浦两大铁路，津榆、津平、津盐等公路。位置优良，地势平坦，交通便利，水量充足，为极有希望之耕垦地区。
    上述耕垦事业发端于光绪十二年，李鸿章利用退伍淮军，在小站开渠种稻（小站稻即以此得名）。日寇侵占我华北后，即视此地为利源，于一九四一年创办伪华北垦业公司，夺取原有公地，并低价强购民地，建设水利工程，先开辟冀东、芦台、军粮城、张贵庄、津北、小站、咸水沽、天津市周八个农区，包括一百三十六个农场，预垦地一百一十六万余亩。其中已开垦者，水田二十三万七千余亩，旱田十万零七千亩，共垦地三十四万四千亩。并建有大规模的机器碾米厂、稻谷榨油厂，及稻草绳制造厂，进行副产加工。
    一九四五年日寇投降后，该区为国民党匪帮接收，中央地方，争权夺利，将上述垦业系统四分五裂。伪农林部接收者，成立河北垦业农场管理处，辖有军粮城、张贵庄、小站、八里台、茶淀、黄村等六个农区；由伪河北省建设厅接收者，成立河北省农田局，亦辖有军粮城、张贵庄、小站、八里台、津郊、中和等九个农区，并在茶淀另设“难民”（逃亡地主）合作农场。虚设重叠官僚机构，并未实际很好经营管理，因之效果较过去反大为降低。再加之以当地群众深恨日伪，遂乘机破坏，除军粮城、张贵庄两地外，农场设备大部被毁，芦台、茶淀、商簏圈，移民居住宅及扬水设备，更破坏无余。
    二、解放后的恢复工作
    天津解放后，上述垦业机关，为我华北人民政府农业部接收。首先裁并骈枝机关，建立津沽区农垦管理局，统一领导，积极从事恢复工作。据目前统计，今年播种已达廿三万三千四百九十七亩，已超过国民党管理时期的播种面积百分之三十九，达日寇时期播种面积的百分之六十七。如年成无大变化，除群众收益外，尚可经营获利稻谷二千万斤左右。他们今年并进行了比国民党时期任何一年为大的岁修工程，修复了军粮城、张贵庄国民党从来没有修复的工程，冀东在芦台，冀中在小站，亦均动员了庞大人力，进行修复工作。农业部并组织水利工程队，协助勘测高丽圈，茶淀、芦台等地准备继续恢复。此外本年并举办贷款，购买豆饼一千余万斤，贷给农户。因之农民异常兴奋，积极参加恢复工作。
    三、经营与管理
    过去日寇垦殖经营的目的，主要是为了供给军米，用残暴的统治力量管制与剥削群众，稻谷收获必须全部交给日伪，然后由日伪配给农户以少量的杂粮及粗布。剥削是非常惨重的，农户配给所得，往往不及百分之五十，再交还肥料种籽等贷款，农户所得最多超不过其劳动收获百分之三十。同时日寇为了便利统治与压榨农民，往往把土地租给当地有势力的地主、富农，转租农民而从中剥削。因为农民处在日伪及二地主等重重剥削之下，虽然稻作产量年有增加（好地达八百斤，平均四百斤），但仍无法摆脱贫困，垦荒种稻已七、八年之久，自己尚无能力进行再生产投资，非举办贷肥贷种即不能进行生产。
    我们接收后，对已垦荒地，采取将土地分给群众耕耘，由农场进行水利工程，建设扬水设备，根据公私两利的原则，研究合理的科学的分红办法，向群众收回水电及经营管理费用。其办法是按照土地质量，劳畜力需要程度，肥料种籽投资，以及扬水费用、岁修工程、机器折旧、管理需要等，以合理的分配收获物（副产全归农户）。上述分红办法已拟就草案，正征求当地农民意见，待修正后，即于本年试行。
    除上述分给群众经营者外，现在尚未开垦之广大荒地，农业部正拟以之建立国营农场，保持大块土地，使用拖拉机耕作，设置电力扬水，用现代化的经营方法，大规模的经营。并在荒地属于私有地带，试办合作农场；即由国家进行水利设备，使用拖拉机代耕，征收一定数量的费用，在群众自愿原则下，组织起来，合伙耕作。并以国营农场为中心，与合作农场互相依辅，构成新型农业经济体系；吸取经验典型示范，刻已运到拖拉机十部，拟在高丽圈开始试办。但经营上述国营或合作农场，必须经过周密设计，使之完全适应新的要求。各农场中以高里圈、柏格庄等农场为好。以高里圈为例，其房舍建筑共分三十四里，除中央里供农区办公之用外，其余三十三里，每里农户三十二家，土地每三百亩一整块，宜于使用进步工具，其他如道路连系，水道组织，供电设备，亦均较合理。但有些农区管理设置，不甚科学，特别是有些农户为了适应自己的小块土地，随便开渠引水，或为了适应以龙骨水车进行扬水，即将渠道破坏。甚至有些地方干部，主张将大块农场土地分给农民，或将成块的芦苇等租给群众，分散经营，这都是不妥当的应即加以克服。
    经营范围以洗碱种稻为主，水量不足者进行旱作，或水旱轮作。并兼营副业如芦苇、果树、向日葵、打鱼、畜牧等，逐渐发展农副业加工制造，使之成为完整的现代化农业经营。
    敌伪时代之管理机构与管理方法，主要是为了便利于统治，以达到其压榨农民的目的。我们接收后，则与此完全相反，而是以如何便于领导群众，发展生产，真正执行管理民主化的原则，同时通过民主管理逐渐启发群众的积极性，教育农民以使用科学技术的能力，逐步组织农民自己管理扬水、使水、水道、及新式农具的使用等。在供销方面，亦正进行改造旧日以剥削农民、贪污自肥的合作社，建立真正为农民服务的合作社，以负责推销稻米，供给杂粮，以及组织副业生产推销副业产品等工作。并逐渐发展供给农民肥料与优良稻种，代政府办理农贷等。此外他们正在筹划较大的供销社，拟以经济力量扶植上述合作社的发展。
    四、发展前途与目前需要解决的问题
    渤海沿海地区，共有可耕地四百余万亩（日寇所圈预垦地达一百一十余万亩）。姑以开垦三百万亩计，水旱地各半，每年即可增产粮食九亿斤。沿海地广人稀，劳力不足，除当地农民可种植一部外，尚需移入劳力六万到十万人，如以驻军屯垦，至少可容二十万人。唯以目前人力、物力、技术条件限制，势难一时全部开垦，必须根据先易后难的原则，有计划的有步骤的分段进行，第一期以全部恢复与开垦过去所预垦荒地一百余万亩为目标。本年除已播种之二十三万余亩外，并以高丽圈及芦台一至八号农场，茶淀合作农场为恢复重点。预计上述工程全部完成，可增加稻田十一万亩。明年拟在任凤庄、柏格庄、杨柳青、黄骅及津郊张贵庄等五处，再开垦二十二万亩。第三年仍在上述各地继续发展开垦三十八万亩。连同现有农场尚可恢复之荒地，则三年之后垦地可达百万余亩。如人力物力充裕，计划尚可提前。
    欲完成上述垦殖计划，必须调查研究，设置周密，并立即进行充分准备工作。如：
    第一、碱地改良的试验、研究工作。这为农业中较艰难的复杂任务。在华北农业生产中亦甚重要，目前华北区划中即有碱地九百七十余万亩，若能研究全部改良利用，则可增加大量生产。津沽区洗碱种稻，带有典型作用，必须集中碱地改良专家，研究设置，以免失败。刻津沽区农垦管理局领导之军粮城工作站，即专作试验研究改良碱地，优良稻种繁殖及虫害防治等，应加强其工作。
    第二、水利工程亦为本区农垦中的主要环节。引水灌溉应与防洪治河相结合，与排除积水相结合（如黄骅等地），必须有足够数量的水利工程人员，并须有较高技术条件者主持设计，统盘筹划，以免陷于被动，或片断施工，遭致损失。
    第三、现有管理人才亦极缺乏。创造国营农场与合作农场使用进步技术，都是新的事业。为了能使此项事业有效发展，必须训练与培养此项人才。
    第四、发展副业的计划与研究亦须同时进行，根据不同条件，尽可能做到适当的按地区分工，如芦苇、渔塘、向日葵、果树等，都须经过勘测研究后，划定发展区域。副产加工，亦应着手组织，如制稻草绳、制草袋、稻谷榨油及渔产加工等。现在已有相当基础，应即恢复并逐渐扩大。
