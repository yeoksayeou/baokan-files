　　Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, June 6th: Pyongyang dispatch: Labor Newspaper, in an editorial titled "Nationwide Struggle to Achieve National Unification," strongly stated: All the Korean people are eagerly awaiting the founding of the Democratic Fatherland United Front and are actively assisting in the preparations for this organization. The editorial continued: All the people of North and South Korea are united in the struggle to achieve the withdrawal of American troops and national unification. The establishment of the Democratic Fatherland United Front is not merely a united front of left-wing parties in North and South Korea, but a nationwide united front of all patriotic organizations in Korea striving for national unification. This is why all patriotic elements in Korea who care about the fate of their motherland are united around the Democratic Fatherland United Front, striving to force the withdrawal of American imperialist troops and overthrow the traitorous Syngman Rhee government. All loyal Koreans have no doubt that the people fighting for independence and democracy will win victory. The Democratic Fatherland United Front will closely unite all patriotic forces to fight for the independence, freedom, and territorial integrity of our country.

　　全鲜人民团结一致　热望祖国阵线成立
  　劳动新闻发表社论
    【新华社北平六日电】平壤讯：劳动新闻在题为“争取国家统一的全国性斗争”的社论中力称：朝鲜全体人民正殷切地等待着民主祖国联合阵线的成立，并积极帮助这个组织的准备工作。社论继称：南北朝鲜全体人民正团结一致，为使美军撤退和国家统一而斗争。民主祖国联合阵线的成立，不只是南北朝鲜左翼政党的联合阵线，而是朝鲜为国家统一而斗争的一切爱国团体的全国性的联合阵线。这就是为什么关心祖国命运的朝鲜一切爱国分子都团结在民主祖国联合阵线周围，努力为使美帝国主义军队撤退及推翻李承晚卖国政府而斗争的原因。一切忠诚的朝鲜人士都毫不怀疑：为独立与民主而斗争的人民将赢得胜利。民主祖国联合阵线将紧紧地团结一切爱国力量，为我国的独立、自由、与领土完整而斗争。
