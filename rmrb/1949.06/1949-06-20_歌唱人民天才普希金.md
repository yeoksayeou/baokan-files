　　Singing of the People's Genius Pushkin
    Ke Zhongping
    Pushkin, the flower of the Russian people,
    This flower would rather die than bloom in the house of emperors.
　
    Pushkin, the sword of the Russian people,
    The stars are not as bright as he,
    Lightning is not as swift as he,
    Because he is—
    The heroic spirit of the Russian people.
　
    Pushkin, the genius of the Russian people,
    His poems, from the hearts of the Russian people,
    Gush forth,
    Like a spring from a high mountain,
    The spring flows into a river,
    The river flows into the sea,
    Pushkin's poems,
    Are as solemn as the Russian mountains,
    As pure as the Russian springs,
    As brave as the Russian rivers,
    As magnificent as the Russian seas.
    The genius of the Russian people,
    Filled with the spirit of the Russian people.
　
    Pushkin,
    He sang the hearts of the Russian people,
    Like the spring breeze singing over the mountains,
    Singing over the grasslands,
    Singing over the river and singing over the sea,
    Singing over all the borders,
    All the people,
    Open their hearts,
    Welcoming the Russian people, the genius of the Russian people.
    Pushkin's birthday is today,
    What can the people of New China use to commemorate it?
    Take the bright and warm rays of a hundred suns,
    Take the heroic spirit of 475 million people!
    (Written in Peiping on June 6, 1949, recited at the Pushkin Birthday celebration on the same day)

　　歌唱人民天才普希金
    柯仲平
    普希金，俄罗斯人民的花，
    这花宁死不愿开在帝王家。
　
    普希金，俄罗斯人民的宝剑，
    星星没有他光彩，
    闪电没有他明快，
    因为他就是——
    俄罗斯人民的英雄气概。
　
    普希金，俄罗斯人民天才，
    他的诗，从俄罗斯人民的心，
    涌将出来，
    象从高山里，涌出流泉，
    泉流成江，
    江流成海，
    普希金的诗，
    庄严象俄罗斯的高山，
    纯洁象俄罗斯的流泉，
    同俄罗斯的江一样勇敢，
    同俄罗斯的海一样壮观。
    俄罗斯人民天才，
    充满俄罗斯人民气派。
　
    普希金，
    他把俄罗斯人民的心歌唱出来，
    象春风唱过高山，
    唱过草原，
    唱过江又唱过海，
    唱过了一切的国界，
    一切的人民，
    都把心敞开，
    欢迎俄罗斯人民，俄罗斯人民天才。
    普希金的寿诞在今天，
    新中国的人民拿什么来纪念？
    拿一百个太阳的热情光彩，
    拿四万几千万人民的英雄气概！
    （一九四九年六月六日在北平作成，朗诵在同日普希金寿诞大会上）
