    Laying the Foundation for a Victorious Industrial Construction in North China
    —Achievements of the First North China Workers' Representative Conference
    The First North China Workers' Representative Conference, under the correct leadership of the North China Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, and with the help of the North China People's Government, has achieved significant gains. We hope that the representatives will return to their respective areas to conscientiously convey and implement the conference resolutions.
    Since the heroic "February 7th" strike, the working class of North China has demonstrated its great unity and strength. However, due to the oppression of the Kuomintang and the long-term division by the Japanese invaders, our workers have long been in a state of extreme suffering, darkness, and disunity. Now, under the wise leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, and the valiant battles of the People's Liberation Army, the entire North China region has been liberated. This has enabled the working class of North China to victoriously converge from long-term, arduous struggles in various forms. The 525 representatives who attended the conference included outstanding members of the old and new areas, from various industrial sectors and trades, labor heroes, factory directors, managers, and responsible cadres from North China's enterprise, transportation, postal and telecommunications, railway, and cooperative trade departments. It can truly be said that they were all gathered together. All the representatives enthusiastically responded to the call of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China to "strive for the restoration and development of industrial production." They unanimously pledged to unite all workers in the region, adopt a new attitude of labor as masters of the country, and work with enthusiasm to develop production, support the southward advance of the army, strive for the rapid arrival of national liberation, and fight for the development of North China's industry and the construction of a New China. They earnestly discussed the report on the current tasks of the North China workers' movement and, based on the urgent need to develop production and the demands of workers throughout the region, adopted several important resolutions. This not only fully demonstrates the solid unity of our North China working class and the tendency towards unification of the workers' movement, but will also form the main force for restoring and developing industrial production and building a new North China in the future. Therefore, this conference, whether for the workers' movement or for the development of industry, has laid a victorious foundation for building a new North China. Therefore, it is unprecedented and successful in the history of the North China workers' movement!
    After the liberation of North China, all industrial production urgently needs to be restored and developed. In the process of restoring and developing production, many new problems have arisen that urgently need to be solved. This conference, based on the call of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China to "strive for the restoration and development of industrial production" and 159 proposals of 13 categories from representatives from various regions, formulated several resolutions and draft regulations. These basically solved several new and important problems, providing specific guidance, methods, and guarantees for how to implement the Central Committee's instructions on "restoring and developing industrial production," how to transition from wartime industry to peacetime industry, and how to strengthen the leadership of the workers' movement.
    The important problems solved at this conference mainly included three aspects: First, the "Decision on Establishing Factory Management Committees and Factory Workers' Representative Conferences." This is a concrete step towards how to run people's enterprises well and implement the instructions on the democratization of factory management from the Sixth National Labor Congress. Facts have proven that only by implementing democratic management, establishing factory management committees and factory workers' representative conferences in all state-owned and public-owned factories and enterprises, enhancing the sense of ownership among the worker masses, promoting the initiative and creativity of the worker masses, and consciously, voluntarily, and in an organized and disciplined manner improving production and increasing production, and cultivating workers' ability to manage production, can the goal of running factories well by relying on all workers be achieved. Under this unified guideline, organizational methods and respective powers of the management committee and the workers' representative conference are further stipulated; and successful conditions are created for carrying out democratic management movement in state-owned and public-owned enterprises in the future. Second, the "Resolution (Draft) on Establishing Supply Stores and Consumer Cooperatives to Ensure the Livelihood of Workers." Based on the "wage system calculated in kind" implemented in North China in the past, although it basically guaranteed the stability of workers' lives, wages were paid in currency converted from kind according to market prices. After receiving their wages, workers had to use currency to purchase daily necessities in the market. Often, due to the manipulation of speculators and the relationship between supply and demand after wages were paid, prices fluctuated, making it impossible for workers to obtain the actual wages they deserved. The formulation of this draft, and the suggestion that the state allocate a fixed amount of essential daily necessities to workers and supplement them with worker consumer cooperatives, can effectively reduce the above losses for the worker masses and further guarantee the stability of workers' lives. This draft also stipulates specific methods and steps for implementation, making it possible to avoid many detours in the establishment of supply stores and consumer cooperatives. Third, the "Resolution (Draft) on Concluding Collective Contracts in North China's State-Owned and Public-Owned Enterprises" and the Outline (Draft) of Collective Contracts more specifically resolved the relationship between factory administration and the workers' union. In the past and even now, especially in factories in newly liberated areas, due to the lack of experience of management personnel and the misunderstanding of "liberation" by workers, a correct relationship has not been established between the two. Both sides have not clearly stipulated or insufficiently stipulated issues such as production responsibilities, factory rules, wages, working hours, labor insurance, and welfare, resulting in high costs, low output, and low quality. Therefore, in order to correctly implement the new democratic labor policy of taking into account both public and private interests in various state-owned and public-owned enterprises, establish a correct relationship between the public and private sectors, give full play to the labor enthusiasm of workers, improve production conditions, increase output, improve quality, and reduce costs, it is necessary to have clear regulations on the rights and obligations of factory administration and workers, and it is necessary for both parties to each appoint a certain number of representatives to adopt a consultative approach to sign a written contract with a certain period of time – a collective contract, so that both parties have a basis and guideline for the implementation of various specific issues such as production responsibilities, factory rules, wages, working hours, labor insurance and welfare, and establish a rational production order.
    In addition, the conference also put forward five suggestive opinions to the North China People's Government, requesting the government to consider handling them based on possible situations. Namely, (1) It is recommended to establish labor bureaus or sections in the provincial, municipal, and county governments with more industries, so that various labor problems can be properly and quickly resolved by specialized agencies. (2) It is recommended to organize as soon as possible an industrial demobilization committee with the participation of relevant enterprise departments and workers' unions, responsible for planning the method of transforming wartime industries into peacetime industries, and carefully handling the current worker transfer problems caused by factory production cuts and closures in the old areas. (3) It is recommended to promulgate a unified income tax law for wages as soon as possible, so that the tax rates and methods are consistent across regions, and the burden on workers is consistent. (4) It is recommended that large industrial and mining areas be divided into industrial zones, and divided into separate administrative regions or cities, and district governments or municipal governments be established. (5) It is recommended to restore and establish schools in workers' districts to strengthen the education of workers and their children.
    Developing industry has become the central link in future work, and the solution of the above three important problems, as well as the five important suggestions, are indispensable guidelines and steps for developing industry.
    The scale of North China's industry and transportation is second only to the Northeast, ranking second in the country. Part of it was built during the Anti-Japanese War under very difficult conditions. During this period, the working class of North China displayed a high degree of patriotism and revolutionary enthusiasm, overcame difficulties, fought bravely, and defeated the Japanese fascist's cruel and frequent attacks and "sweeps." Many labor heroes and model workers emerged in the production battle, and they accumulated rich experience, creating various favorable conditions for restoring and developing production in the future. Inheriting our glorious historical traditions, coupled with the unprecedented favorable situation of the liberation of the entire North China and the imminent liberation of the entire country, and the great achievements of this conference, it undoubtedly paves the way for future industrial construction and lays a victorious foundation. Therefore, at a time when our cause is just beginning, we should neither be proud of the national victory nor bow our heads to the difficulties in progress. Let us conscientiously implement the spirit of the conference, and we have full confidence and courage to complete the second task of history!

    打下建设工业华北的胜利基础
    ——华北第一届职工代表会议的成果
    华北第一届职工代表会议，在中共中央华北局及中华全国总工会的正确领导和华北人民政府的帮助下，取得重大收获，我们希望代表们回到各地认真传达贯澈大会决议的实现。
    华北工人阶级在“二七”英勇斗争以来，都表现了工人阶级的伟大团结和强大力量。但历经国民党的压迫，和日寇长期的分割，使我们工人久处于极痛苦、黑暗和分散的状态；而今在共产党及毛主席英明领导之下，在人民解放军英勇奋战之下，华北全境解放，从而使华北工人阶级由长期的不同形式的艰苦斗争中胜利的会合起来，就到会的五百二十五名代表来说，包括了老区新区的各产业部门、各行业职工中的优秀分子、劳动英雄、厂长、经理以及华北企业、交通、邮电、铁路、合作贸易等部门的负责干部，真可说济济一堂。全体代表热烈响应了中共中央“为恢复与发展工业生产而奋斗”的号召，一致保证团结全区职工，以主人翁的新的劳动态度与劳动热忱，努力发展生产支援南下大军，争取全国解放的迅速到来，为发展华北工业、建设新中国而奋斗。他们认真地讨论了华北职工运动当前任务的报告，并根据目前发展生产的迫切需要和全区职工的要求，通过了几项重要决议。这不仅充分表现了我们华北工人阶级的坚固团结和职工运动的趋于统一，并将形成今后恢复与发展工业生产、建设新华北的主力军。因此，这次大会无论对职工运动对发展工业来说，均打下建设新华北的胜利基础。因此，它在华北职工运动史上是空前的、成功的！
    华北解放之后，一切工业生产均急待恢复与发展，而在恢复与发展生产中又遇到许多新的问题亟待解决，这次大会即根据了中共中央“为恢复和发展工业生产而奋斗”的号召，和各地代表十三类一百五十九件提案，拟定了几项决议和条例草案，从基本上解决了几项新的重要问题，这就使如何贯彻执行中央“为恢复和发展工业生产”的指示，以及由战时工业转为平时工业，和加强职工运动之领导等等，在实施的方针、办法和步骤上有了一定的遵循，有了一定的门径，有了一定的保证。
    这次解决了的重要问题，主要者有三：一为“关于建立工厂管理委员会与工厂职工代表会议的决定”，这是如何办好人民的企业，和贯彻全国第六次劳动大会工厂管理民主化指示的具体实施的步骤，事实证明，只有实行管理民主化，在一切国营公营工厂企业中建立工厂管理委员会与工厂职工代表会议，来增进工人群众的主人翁的感觉，以发扬职工群众的积极性创造性，而自觉自愿地、有组织、有纪律地来改进生产、提高生产，并培养工人管理生产的能力，才能达到依靠全体职工办好工厂的目的。在这统一的方针下，更规定了管委会和职工代表会议的组织办法，和各自的职权；并为今后国营公营企业中开展管理民主化运动，创造下成功的条件。二为“建立供给商店与消费合作社保障职工生活的决议”（草案），根据过去华北所实施的“以实物计算的工资制度”，虽在基本上保证了职工生活安定，但薪资是以实物按市价折货币发给，而职工在领得薪资后又以货币到市场上购买日用必需品，往往在发工资后由于投机商人的操纵及供求关系等原因，物价即起波动，使职工得不到应有的实际工资。那么这一草案的制定，并建议由国家给职工配售定量的生活主要必需品并辅之以职工消费合作社，就可以有效的使职工群众减少以上的损失，而进一步保证了职工生活的安定。这一草案同样的规定了实施的具体办法和步骤，使建立供给商店与消费合作社可能少走好些弯路。三为“关于华北国营公营企业订立集体合同的决议”（草案）及集体合同纲要（草案），更具体的解决了工厂行政与职工会的关系问题。过去以及现在，特别是在新解放地区的工厂，由于管理人员缺乏经验和工人对“解放”的误解，二者之间未能树立起正确的关系，双方对于生产责任、工厂规则、工资、工时、劳动保险及福利等等问题，均未明确规定或规定的不够合理，致造成成本高，产量少，质量低之现象。因此，为使各国营公营企业正确实行公私兼顾的新民主主义劳动政策，树立公私之间的正确关系，以发挥职工劳动积极性，改善生产状况、增加产量、提高质量、减低成本，必须对工厂行政与职工的权利和义务有明确的规定，必须由双方各推定一定数量之代表，采取磋商方式，订定一定期限的书面契约——集体合同，以便双方对于生产责任、工厂规则、工资、工时、劳动保险福利等各项具体问题的执行有所依据与遵循，确立合理的生产秩序。
    此外，会议并向华北人民政府提出五点建议性的意见，请政府根据可能情况斟酌办理。即（一）建议在各省市政府及工业较多的县政府内设立劳动局或科，使各种劳动问题有专管机关能得到正确而迅速的解决。（二）建议尽早组织有关企业部门及职工会参加的工业复员委员会，负责计划将战时工业转为平时工业的办法，并慎重处理当前老区因工厂减产停闭而发生的工人转业问题。（三）建议从速颁布统一的工薪所得税则，使各地的税率和办法一致，职工负担的轻重一致。（四）建议大工矿区划为工业区，分别划成单独行政区或市，设立区政府或市政府。（五）建议恢复和建立工人区内的学校，以加强职工教育及其子弟教育。
    发展工业既成为今后工作的中心环节，而以上三项重要问题的解决，以及五项重要建议，均为发展工业中不可缺少的方针与步骤。
    华北工业和交通运输业的规模，仅次于东北，占全国第二位，其中一部分是在抗战期间十分艰苦的环境下建设起来的。在这期间，华北工人阶级发挥了高度的爱国热情与革命积极性，克服困难，英勇斗争，战胜了日本法西斯残酷的频繁的进攻和“扫荡”，在生产战斗中涌现了许多劳动英雄和模范工作者，并积累了丰富的经验，也创造了今后恢复与发展生产的各种有利条件。继承我们光荣的历史传统，加以华北全境解放，全国即将全部解放之空前有利的形势，有了此次大会之巨大收获，无疑是为今后工业建设铺平了道路，打下了胜利的基础。因此，在我们的事业还是刚刚开始的时候，我们既不应为全国胜利而骄傲，亦不应为进步中的困难而低头。让我们把大会的精神切实贯彻下去，我们是有充分的信心和勇气，来完成历史的第二步任务！
