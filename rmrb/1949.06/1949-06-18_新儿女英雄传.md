    The New Heroes and Heroines
    Chapter Nine: The Moment of Life and Death (Continued 1)
    Three

    Da Shui stayed at Uncle Yin's house for several days. The Japanese devils and traitors kept harassing them, but they managed to deal with it. Da Shui thought, "With the masses protecting me, it's quite safe to stay in this 'chicken coop'." But he also thought, "If I stay here all the time, I won't know anything about the outside situation. I can't see Shuangxi and the others, and I don't know where Xiaomei is. I also don't know how my family is doing! Hiding in holes every day, I can't do any work. Won't that drive a person crazy?"

    One evening, he said goodbye to Uncle Yin and went to find his gun first.

    The moon shone brightly in the fields. The sorghum and corn had grown tall, but the grass was also very thick. Da Shui felt sorry thinking, "This land should be weeded!" In a forest, he met Zhao Wugeng and Ai Heshang. The comrades were much brighter when they met. After talking for a few words, Ai Heshang pulled Da Shui's arm and said, "Da Shui, I'm going to tell you something, but don't be sad!" Da Shui quickly asked what it was. Ai Heshang said, "The enemy arrested your father and forced him to give you up. The old man suffered a bit, but the village bailed him out. He passed away in less than two days!" Da Shui listened, sitting blankly on the grave. Ai Heshang tried to persuade him, and he burst into tears.

    Niu Da Shui cried more and more sadly. Ai Heshang and Zhao Wugeng persuaded him for a long time before he wiped away his tears and gritted his teeth, saying, "What ruthless Japanese devils and traitors! They didn't spare such an old and sick man! If I, Niu Da Shui, live, I will definitely avenge him!" He inquired about the news of his comrades and his brother Xiao Shui. Wugeng said that he had met Ma Danxiao, and heard that Xiao Shui was with Shuangxi; he also said that Gao Tun'er had been rescued, Yang Xiaomei had also escaped, and Shuangxi had taken away the guns buried in the ground... Da Shui felt a little relieved after hearing this.

    Da Shui then asked where Hei Lao Cai and Shuangxi were. Ai Heshang quietly told the location of Hei Lao Cai, saying that he had just come from there and met Zhao Wugeng on the way; Hei Lao Cai said that Shuangxi was in Xiyu Village, and asked everyone to contact Shuangxi—to contact the organization, and never lose contact; he also asked everyone to carry their guns with them, and under no circumstances should they give up their weapons, and when necessary, they must fight the enemy. He also asked the comrades to do more mass work... Ai Heshang couldn't remember all these words clearly, only said a rough idea. Finally he said, "Hei Lao Cai has already assigned the work to Shuangxi, let's go find Shuangxi quickly. Shuangxi is staying at a stronghold household's house."

    Zhao Wugeng was also about to find Shuangxi, so the three of them hurried to Xiyu Village. Who would have thought that Ai Heshang was confused and remembered the location wrong again; Wugeng only knew that Shuangxi was in this village, but couldn't say which house. They looked for a long time and couldn't find it, and were very anxious. Seeing that the Dipper star was only a tree-height away in the west, it was almost dawn. They didn't dare to stay in the village, so they went to the farmland outside the village, found a threshing ground, and slept next to the straw pile, with the three of them taking turns on sentry duty.

    Just as it was getting light, the enemy came to surround the village; the Japanese devils were afraid that the common people would find out, so they all walked through the sorghum fields, led by plainclothes traitors. Ai Heshang, who was on sentry duty, fell asleep!

    Da Shui vaguely heard the rustling of sorghum leaves, and was startled. He sat up and looked back. Not good, four or five plainclothes men were walking this way; he quickly woke Zhao Wugeng and said, "Wake up! I don't know who's coming!" Then he went to push Ai Heshang. Zhao Wugeng quickly stood up with his gun, and said, "Run! The enemy is here!" and rushed forward. The enemy discovered the target and hurried to chase him. Da Shui and Ai Heshang didn't have guns. Seeing a sorghum stalk mat next to the straw pile, they crawled in.

    Seeing the enemy chasing him, Zhao Wugeng hurriedly turned around and fired two shots, killing one of the enemies in front, and then disappeared. Da Shui and Ai Heshang crawled out from the other end of the sorghum stalk mat and rushed into the sorghum field. Unexpectedly, they ran into the Japanese devils head-on. One pressed Da Shui's head and pinned him down. If Da Shui had a gun, he could have killed the Japanese devil and escaped; but he was empty-handed. With a sudden jerk, his jacket tore with a "whoosh". The Japanese devil twisted his ear, and Da Shui struggled to turn around, giving him a slap in the face, sending the devil staggering; one finger hit the steel helmet, and it hurt numbly. Over there, Ai Heshang was also fighting with a Japanese devil.

    Da Shui was about to run when two more Japanese devils ran over, saying, "Good, good! Wrestling, wrestling!" It turned out that the Japanese devils loved wrestling, so they threw away their guns and wanted to capture them alive. One Japanese devil rushed up first, hugged Da Shui and started wrestling, grunting. The two of them rolled around on the ground, fighting blindly. The two Japanese devils next to them saw that Da Shui was strong, and they all pounced on him. Da Shui couldn't beat three of them, and they pinned him down. The Japanese devils untied Da Shui's waistband and tied him up. On Ai Heshang's side, there was only one Japanese devil; Ai Heshang was very strong and threw him aside and ran, but the Japanese devil got up and chased after him...

    Four

    It was dawn. The enemy dragged Niu Da Shui to the threshing ground, and a group of Japanese devils surrounded him to watch. The short Japanese devil squad leader, Fan Ye, used his hand to touch Da Shui's wrist, that wrist was really thick and strong; he also used his hand to measure Da Shui's shoulders, much wider than his own; his red, drunken nose snorted, and he muttered something. The Japanese devil who had been slapped, people called him something like "Chuyi Jiasanlang", was a tall man; he always pouted, lowered his head, and rolled his eyes to look at Da Shui. The Japanese devils looked at him, then looked at Da Shui, and all giggled and laughed.

    Squad Leader Fan Ye could speak a few words of Chinese, and asked Da Shui, "What kind of work you doing?" Da Shui saw that there was a well and a vegetable garden next to him, so he said, "Watching melons." The traitor asked, "Watching what kind of melons?" Da Shui said, "Watching winter melons." Fan Ye's red nose shrank, revealing a look of disbelief. He snorted, bent down and looked at Da Shui's palm, no calluses; he also kicked Da Shui's calf, which was quite strong; immediately his eyes bulged, and he said, "Ha, Eighth Route Army's got!" Then he took him to the big dike next to the north entrance of the village.

    They tied Da Shui to a willow tree by the dike, with his hands tied behind his back, and three ropes tied him tightly from top to bottom. Some of the Japanese devils slapped him, and some kicked him with big leather shoes. Just as they were beating him fiercely, another group of Japanese devils came over, pushing a person; that person's head was covered in blood. Da Shui was shocked and recognized him as Ai Heshang. Because Ai Heshang was empty-handed, he was also captured alive.

    The Japanese devils pushed him in front of Niu Da Shui. A traitor held Ai Heshang's black leather belt in his hand, pointed at Da Shui, and asked Ai Heshang, "Do you recognize him?" Da Shui quickly said, "I don't recognize him, how could he recognize me?" The traitor slapped Da Shui in the face with the leather belt: "Who the hell asked you?" Then he asked Ai Heshang, "Speak! Do you recognize him or not?" Ai Heshang said, "I, I don't recognize him either." The Japanese devils pushed him, and Ai Heshang sat down on the embankment slope.

    Two Japanese devils took two thick wooden sticks and beat Ai Heshang, who screamed like a "little devil". The pain made him dodge to both sides, lean back, and kick his legs up. One stick broke a leg. Ai Heshang was beaten so badly that he suddenly jerked, swooshed down, and crawled into the sorghum field; but his leg was broken, so he couldn't run! The Japanese devils dragged him back and said, "You two all dead, dead!" and shot Ai Heshang to death. Da Shui closed his eyes and waited for them to shoot him, but he didn't hear a gunshot; when he opened his eyes, Ai Heshang had already fallen to the base of the dike.

    Da Shui felt a burst of pain in his heart, thinking, "I'm going to die anyway!" and loudly asked, "Why don't you shoot?" The traitor said, "Are you an Eighth Route Army soldier or not?" Da Shui said, "I am an Eighth Route Army soldier, kill me quickly!" The Japanese devil smiled ferociously and said, "Eighth Route, good, good!" He turned around and said something to the traitor; the traitor said to Da Shui, "Hmph, you want to die, but we won't let you die yet!"

    At this moment, the village was in chaos, with men, women, old and young being driven by the Japanese devils, crying and shouting. A merchant from another place ran out of the village and was also caught by the Japanese devils on the dike. The enemy asked him if he was an Eighth Route Army soldier, he said no, and they opened him up. The merchant quickly shouted, "Don't hit, don't hit! I have something to say. My big brother is good friends with you, please spare me for the sake of my big brother." The traitor asked, "Who is your big brother?" The merchant quickly untied his leg strap, took out a roll of joint bills and said to them, "Look! Isn't this big brother of mine your good friend?" The traitor laughed and said, "This is really a merchant!" Squad Leader Fan Ye squinted his eyes, shrank his nose, revealed a mouthful of yellow teeth, smiled and nodded, and said, "Gold ticket, gold ticket! Merchant, good!" He waved his hand: "Open road, open road!" The merchant climbed up and ran away.

    The villagers were all driven to the village entrance to hold a meeting. The enemy untied Da Shui from the tree and said, "Go! Pick out the Eighth Route Army!" Then they押 (yā - escort, force) him to the meeting place and walked from one end to the other, telling him to "ba xiang" (拔相 - pick people). Men, women, old and young were all trembling with fear, staring blankly at Da Shui. Da Shui saw Shuangxi standing inside at a glance, and his heart jumped. Shuangxi's eyes stared straight at him, as if saying, "You are a Communist, see if you are resolute or not!"

    Squad Leader Fan Ye held a bayonet in his hand and asked Da Shui, "Are there any Eighth Route Army soldiers inside?" Da Shui said, "No!" Fan Ye glared, hating and嗯嗯嗯 (ēn ēn ēn - grunt) grunting, raised the bayonet and stabbed it at Da Shui's heart. Da Shui turned his face away, gritted his teeth and said, "Anyway, there aren't any! Stab me!" Fan Ye snorted and pushed Da Shui forward. The faces of the masses turned yellow with fright, and they held back tears. Da Shui saw Ma Danxiao, Gu Zichun, as well as his brother Xiao Shui, and many other team members and cadres inside; one by one, they stared at him, frightened.

    The enemy押 (yā - escort, force) Da Shui walked through the field once, and Da Shui didn't say a single one. Squad Leader Fan Ye got angry and yelled something back. Immediately a Japanese soldier led three foreign dogs, all panting with red tongues. Fan Ye呜噜 (wū lū - mutter) grunted, pointed at Da Shui's leg; one dog窜 (cuàn - dart) rushed up, and with one bite, it tore off a large piece of flesh and trousers, dripping with blood. Da Shui struggled and screamed miserably; the pain made sweat beads roll down his head. Fan Ye pointed at Da Shui's arm again, and the foreign dog suddenly stood up, pounced forward with two claws, and bit him again; Da Shui fainted.

    Suddenly, an old woman with white hair, stumbled out of the crowd, threw herself on Da Shui, and shouted with tears in her eyes, "Don't do evil! This is my son! You're going to kill him!" The masses all cried. Hundreds of men, women, old and young all begged, "He is really a good farmer. Please spare him!" The Japanese devils were afraid that the common people would pity him, so they kicked the old woman away,架 (jià - support) propped up Da Shui, and took him away.

    新儿女英雄传
    第九回　生死关头　　（续一）
    三
    大水在尹大伯家，一连住了好几天，鬼子汉奸常来折腾，都应付过去了。大水想：“有群众掩护，待在这‘草鸡窠’里倒挺稳当。”可是他又想：“老呆在这儿，外面的情形一点不知道，双喜他们都见不着，小梅又不知道下落，家里老人也不知道怎么着了！天天钻洞，什么工作也不能干，可不把人蹩死呀？”
    一天晚上，他辞别了尹大伯，先去寻他的枪。
    野地里，月亮照得挺明快；高粱、棒子都长高了，可是草也长得挺稠。大水心疼的想：“这地可是该锄啦！”在一片树林里，他碰见赵五更、艾和尚。同志们见了面，心里可豁亮多了。谈了几句话，艾和尚就拉着大水的胳膊说：“大水啊，我说给你一件事儿，你可别难过！”大水忙问什么事。艾和尚说：“敌人把你爹抓去，逼着要人，老人家受了点儿罪，村里保他出来，没两天就去世了！”大水听了，呆呆的坐在坟头上；艾和尚一劝，他就哭开了。
    牛大水越哭越伤心。艾和尚和赵五更劝了半天，他才擦着泪，咬牙说：“好狠的鬼子汉奸啊！那么大岁数的一个病人，也逃不出他们的毒手！我牛大水活着非报仇不行！”他打听同志们和兄弟小水的消息。五更说碰见马胆小了，听说小水跟着双喜呢；又说高屯儿救活了，杨小梅也逃了出来，埋在地里的枪，双喜都起走了……大水听了，心里才松动点儿。
    大水又问黑老蔡双喜在那儿。艾和尚小声告诉了黑老蔡的地点，说自己才从那儿来，路上遇见的赵五更；黑老蔡说双喜在西渔村，叫大家跟双喜——跟组织联系好，千万不要失掉关系；又叫大家一定要把枪带在身上，在任何情况下，决不能放弃了武装，必要的时候就得跟敌人拼。还叫同志们多作些群众工作……等敌人的疯狂劲儿一过去，就集中力量，打击小股的敌人……这些话，艾和尚可记不清，只说了个大概的意思。末了他说：“黑老蔡已经把工作都布置给双喜了，咱们赶快找双喜去。双喜在一个堡垒户家待着呢。”
    赵五更也正要找双喜，三个人就急急忙忙奔了西渔村。谁想艾和尚糊里糊涂，又把地点记岔了；五更也光知道双喜在这村，可说不清在那一家。他们找了半天没找着，心里挺着急。看看罗锅星在西天只剩一树高，天快明了。他们不敢在村里待，只好到村外庄稼地里，找了一片场，就在滑秸垛旁边睡一会儿，三个人轮流的放哨。
    天刚麻麻亮，敌人来围村了；鬼子怕老百姓发觉，都从高粱地里走，头前是便衣汉奸引路。放哨的艾和尚可睡着了！
    大水迷迷糊糊听见高粱叶子唰唰的响，心一惊，坐起来回头一瞧，不好，四五个便衣往这边走呢；忙叫醒赵五更，说：“快醒醒！不知道什么人来了！”又去推艾和尚。赵五更忙拿着枪站了起来，说一声：“快跑！敌人来了！”就往前窜。敌人发现目标，赶忙去追他。大水艾和尚都没有枪，见滑秸垛旁边靠着个秫秸箔，就钻了进去。
    赵五更看见敌人追他，急道回头打了两枪，打死了头前的一个敌人，就跑得不见影儿了。大水艾和尚从秫秸箔的另一头钻出去，窜进高粱地。没想到顶头碰上了鬼子，一下按着大水的脑瓜儿，把他卡住了。大水要有枪，也就可以把鬼子打死，自己逃走；他可空着手，猛一挺，褂子哗的扯破了。鬼子拧住他一只耳朵，大水挣扎着扭过去，转身一个耳光，把鬼子打了个侧不棱；一个指头打在钢盔上，痛得发麻。那边艾和尚也跟一个鬼子打起来了。
    大水正想跑，另一边又跑来两个鬼子，嘴里说着：“好的好的！上的上的！”原来鬼子爱摔跤，都把枪扔了，要捉活的。一个鬼子先扑上来，抱住大水就摔，嘴里嗯嗯嗯的。他两个就地十八滚，打了个瞎架。旁边两个鬼子看大水劲头儿大，也都扑上来。大水一个打不过三个，给他们按住了，鬼子解下大水的束腰带，把他绑起来。艾和尚那边只一个鬼子；艾和尚急劲儿大，把他摔在一边就跑，那鬼子爬起来就追……
    四
    天明了。敌人把牛大水拉到场上，一群鬼子围着看。矮个的鬼子小队长饭野，用手叉叉大水的手腕，那手腕儿真粗真壮啊；又用手一揸一揸的量量大水的肩膀，比他自己的肩膀宽得多；他那红红的酒糟鼻子哼了一声，嘀哩嘟噜不知说些什么。那挨了巴掌的鬼子，人们都叫他什么“初一加三郎”，是个高个儿；他老噘着嘴，低着头，翻起白眼儿对大水瞅着。鬼子们看看他，又看看大水，都叽哩呷啦乱笑。
    饭野小队长会几句中国话，问大水：“你什么的干活？”大水瞧见旁边有井，有菜园子，就说：“看瓜的。”汉奸问：“看什么瓜？”大水说：“看北瓜。”饭野那红鼻子一缩，露出不相信的神气。他哼了一声，弯下腰去，看看大水的手心，没死肉；又蹬一蹬大水的腿肚子，倒是挺有劲儿；立时眼睛一鼓，说：“吓，八路太君的有！”就把他带到村北口大堤旁边去。
    他们把大水绑在堤边一棵柳树上，手反绑着，上中下三道绳子捆了个紧。鬼子们有的打他耳光，有的用大皮鞋踢他。正打得凶，那边又有一群鬼子，拥着一个人过来；那人头上的血流了一脸。大水吃了一惊，看出他正是艾和尚。艾和尚因为空手，也给活捉了。
    鬼子把他推到牛大水跟前，一个汉奸手里拿着艾和尚的黑皮带，指着大水，问艾和尚：“你认得他不？”大水忙说：“我不认得他，他怎么认得我？”汉奸照大水脸上就是一皮带：“谁他妈的问你呀？”又问艾和尚：“说！认得不认得？”艾和尚说：“我，我也不认得他。”鬼子把他一推，艾和尚就一屁股坐在堤坡上了。
    两个鬼子拿着两根粗木棍，打得艾和尚“小鬼叫”，痛得往两边让、身子一仰、腿一翘，一棍就把一条腿打折了。艾和尚给打急了，猛一挺，呼的往下窜，就钻了高粱地；可是腿折了，他跑不了啦！鬼子把他拖回来，说：“你两个统统死了死了的！”一枪就把艾和尚打死了。大水闭着眼儿等他打，可是不听见枪声；睁眼一看，艾和尚已经栽到堤根下了。
    大水心里一阵疼，想着：“反正活不了啦！”就大声问：“怎么你们不打呀？”汉奸说：“你到底是不是八路军？”大水说：“我就是八路军，你们快打死我吧！”鬼子狞笑说：“八路，好的好的！”回头跟汉奸说了什么话；汉奸对大水说：“哼，你倒想死，且不叫你死哩！”
    这当儿，村子里乱糟糟的，男女老少给鬼子赶得大哭小叫。有个外路来的买卖人往村外一跑，也给鬼子抓到堤边来了。敌人问他是不是八路，他说不是，就打开了。那商人连忙喊：“别打别打！我有个话说。——我的大哥跟你们是好朋友，看我大哥的面上饶了我吧。”汉奸问：“你的大哥是谁？”那商人忙解开腿带，拿出一卷联合票给他们说：“看！我这个大哥不是你们的好朋友吗？”汉奸笑起来说：“这真是个买卖人！”饭野小队长眼一眯，鼻子一缩，露出一口大黄牙，笑嘻嘻的点了点头，说“金票的金票的！买卖人，好！”又一挥手：“开路开路！”商人爬起来就跑了。
    村里的老百姓，都给赶到村口来开会了。敌人把大水从树上解下来，说：“走！挑八路去！”就把他押到会场，从一头走过去，叫他“拔相”（就是挑选人）。男女老少都吓得战战兢兢的，楞着眼儿瞧大水。大水一眼看见双喜也站在里面，心就跳起来了。双喜的眼睛直直的望着他，好象在说：“你可是个共产党员，看你坚决不坚决！”
    饭野小队长手里捏着一把刺刀，问大水：“里面有八路的没有？”大水说：“没有！”那饭野鼓着眼睛，恨得嗯嗯嗯的，举起剌刀，照大水的心窝就刺。大水扭过脸去，咬着牙说：“反正没有！你刺吧！”饭野可哼了一声，又推大水往前走。群众脸都吓黄了，噙着泪花儿。大水看见马胆小、谷子春，还有兄弟小水，和好些队员干部都在里面；一个个瞅着他，吓得神慌。
    敌人押着大水在场里走了一遍，大水一个也没有说出来。饭野小队长起了火，回头吼了一句什么。立刻有个鬼子兵引来三只洋狗，都气咻咻的吐着红舌头。饭野呜噜的叫了一声，指指大水的腿；一个狗就窜上去，只一口就连肉带裤子，血淋淋的撕下一大块。大水挣扎着，凄惨的叫了一声；痛得他头上汗珠儿直往下滚。饭野又指指大水的胳膊，那洋狗猛的直立起来，两个爪子往前一扑，又咬了一口；大水就昏过去了。
    忽然，人群里一个白头发的老妈妈，跌跌撞撞的冲出来，扑在大水身上，眼泪直流的喊：“你们别造孽啦！这是我的儿啊！你们要把他治死啦！”群众都哭下了。几百个男女老少一齐哀求说：“他实在是个好庄稼人啊。你们饶了他吧！”鬼子怕老百姓怜惜他，就一脚踢开老婆儿，把大水架起来，带走了。    （未完）
