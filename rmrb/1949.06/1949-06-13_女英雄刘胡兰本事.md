The Deeds of the Heroine Liu Hulan
    Combat Drama Troupe

　　In 1946, the Chiang Kai-shek-Yan Xishan bandit gang, in order to salvage their dying fate, frantically invaded the Jinzhong border area of our Northwest Liberated Area, implementing bloody suppression, using guillotines, clubs, and live burials to threaten the masses, using money to buy them off, and demanding that the masses "confess," attempting to disintegrate our internal unity and undermine our people's democratic government in order to consolidate their dictatorial and bloody rule. However, the masses were as firm as iron and steel, bravely unyielding, and they all believed that high mountains could not block the sun, and no matter how rampant the reactionaries were for a time, the people would surely be victorious.

    Liu Hulan was a prominent example of this.

    Comrade Liu Hulan, women's association secretary and Communist Party member of Yunzhou West Village, Wenshui County, Jinzhong, led the masses in the village to oppose local bullies and fight corruption, enabling the masses to stand up and gain their freedom. In order to defend the fruits of victory, she organized the masses to make flatbreads and sew military shoes, braving the snow to support the front lines, rescuing wounded Liberation Army soldiers, and sheltering them in her home, coordinating with the front lines to fight a great victory. In order to more actively annihilate the enemy, our army transferred to outer lines for combat. The Yan Xishan bandit's 19th Army (hated by the masses and called the "Hook Army") temporarily occupied Daxiang Town, five miles from Yunzhou West. Liu Hulan stayed awake all night for the sake of the masses and Old Zhao (a wounded Liberation Army soldier), standing guard and patrolling, and in an emergency, she cleverly deceived the secret agents, covering Old Zhao's safe escape.

    The village's big landlord and secret agent, Shi Sanhai, and his relative and nephew, Shitou, worked for the Japanese and the Kuomintang, embezzling and extorting, and oppressing the masses. After liberation, his corruption was exposed, but he was still left with enough land and housing to live on. However, he was incorrigibly evil and not only did he not repent and engage in labor production, but instead, taking advantage of the Yan Xishan bandit's 215th Regiment occupying Daxiang, he disguised himself and left the village, sending intelligence to the machine gun company commander, the bearded Xu. After receiving Shi Sanhai's report, the bearded Xu quickly gathered his troops and surrounded Yunzhou West.

    At that time, the county knew of this emergency situation and immediately sent the county women's secretary, Comrade Lü Xuemei, to Yunzhou West Village to arrange work, deciding that Liu Hulan and others should quickly transfer to the mountains to hide. Liu Hulan, fearing that some people in the village would be unwilling to leave after she left and would suffer greatly, persuaded and arranged things everywhere. For everyone's safety, she was one step late and unfortunately, Liu Hulan and militiaman Yan Liu'er and other comrades were arrested. The enemy used various threats and enticements to force Liu et al. to "confess," attempting to wipe out the village's Communist Party in one fell swoop, but all they heard was a torrent of abuse. The Yan Xishan bandits were both shocked and afraid, at a loss, and after killing Yan Liu'er and several other kind-hearted people, they pointed to the guillotine and said, "If you don't confess, I'll guillotine you!" Liu said, "You can kill me however you want!" The enemy asked, "Aren't you afraid to die!" Liu said, "If I was afraid of death, I wouldn't be a Communist!" Shouting long live the Communist Party! Long live Chairman Mao! She rolled up her sleeves, straightened her hair, and bravely lay on the enemy's guillotine...

    After Chairman Mao heard the news of Comrade Liu Hulan's heroic sacrifice, he gave the inscription "A great life, a glorious death." Comrade Liu Hulan's great spirit of unyielding and the noble integrity of a Communist Party member moved and educated countless people, and the sound of avenging Liu Hulan resounded everywhere.

    The people were not conquered. Killing one Liu Hulan gave birth to thousands of Liu Hulans. After the People's Liberation Army fought back, the people more actively organized armed support for the front lines, and the soldiers fought more fearlessly.

    The people were finally victorious. The executioner, the bearded Xu, was killed in battle, and the accomplice Shitou was punished by the people's court. Shi Sanhai temporarily escaped, but we believe that no matter where he escapes to, he will eventually be brought to justice.

    Friends! Let us work more actively! Comrades! Let us fight more bravely! Avenge Liu Hulan! Resolutely, thoroughly, completely, and entirely eliminate all the remaining forces of the Kuomintang reactionaries.

　　女英雄刘胡兰本事
    战斗剧社
    一九四六年蒋阎匪帮为了挽救他们垂死的命运，向我西北解放区晋中边沿区疯狂侵犯，施行血腥镇压，用铡刀，用乱棍，用活埋，来威胁群众，用金钱来收买，叫群众“自白”想借此来瓦解我们内部，破坏我们人民民主政权，以巩固其专制血腥的统治，但是群众却如铁似钢，英勇不屈，他们都相信，山高遮不住太阳，不管反动派如何猖狂一时，人民一定会胜利的。
    刘胡兰便是其中突出的一个。
    晋中文水县云周西村，妇会秘书，共产党员刘胡兰同志，在村中领导群众反恶霸，反贪污，使群众翻身抬头，为了保卫胜利果实，她又组织群众打饼子，做军鞋，冒雪劳军支援前线，救护解放军伤员，掩护在自己家，配合前线打了大胜仗。为了更主动的歼灭敌人，我军又转移至外线作战去了，阎匪十九军（群众憎恨叫他“勾子军”）暂时又占领距云周西五里之大象镇，刘胡兰为了群众，为了老赵（解放军伤员）整夜不眠，放哨巡风，到紧急情况下，他又巧妙地骗过特务，掩护老赵安全脱险。
    村中大地主特务石三海，及其亲属侄儿石头，帮日本人，帮国民党办事，贪污敲诈，欺压群众，解放后曾被反了贪污，但仍给他留下足够生活的土地、房屋，但他作恶成性，不但不改邪归正去劳动生产，相反趁阎匪十九军二一五团占领大象后，化装出村，送去谍报，将云周西村情况密报给机枪连大胡子徐连长，大胡子得到石三海报告后，很快集合队伍，包围云周西。
    当时县上知道这一紧急情况后，立即派县妇女秘书吕雪梅同志到云周西村布置工作，决定叫刘胡兰他们很快转移到山上去隐蔽。刘胡兰恐怕自己走后，村中有些人不愿走，吃大亏，到处说服，到处布置，为了大家安全，他走晚了一步，不幸刘胡兰和民兵阎六儿等同志被捕了，敌人施以各种威胁利诱，逼刘等“自白”，企图将该村共产党一网打尽，但其所听到的都是一顿臭骂。阎匪又惊又怕，束手无策，他杀了阎六和其他几个善良群众以后，指着铡刀说：“你不自白，我就铡死你！”刘说：“要杀要剐由你！”敌问：“你不怕死！”刘说：“怕死就不当共产党！”高呼共产党万岁！毛主席万岁！将袖子挽起，把头发一理，英勇地躺在敌人铡刀上……
    毛主席听到刘胡兰同志壮烈殉难的消息后，曾赠予“生的伟大，死的光荣”挽词。刘胡兰同志这种威武不屈的伟大精神与共产党员高尚的气节，感动教育了无数人民，到处响起为刘胡兰报仇的声音。
    人民没有被征服，杀死一个刘胡兰，生长出千千万万刘胡兰，人民解放军又打回来以后，人民更积极组织武装支援前线，战士更奋不顾身的作战。
    人民终究胜利了，刽子手大胡子战场上被击毙，帮凶石头被人民法庭惩办，石三海暂时逃跑了，但是我们相信不管他逃到天涯海角，终要归案法办。
    朋友们！让我们更积极的工作吧！同志们！让我们更英勇的战斗吧！为刘胡兰报仇！坚决、彻底、干脆、全部消灭国民党反动派一切残余力量。
