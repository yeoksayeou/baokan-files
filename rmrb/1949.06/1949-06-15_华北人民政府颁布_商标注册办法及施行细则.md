[Report from this Newspaper] The "North China Region Trademark Registration Measures" and its "Implementing Rules," formulated by the North China People's Government, were promulgated and implemented on June 11. The original text is as follows:

　　　　North China Region Trademark Registration Measures

Article 1　These measures are formulated to develop industry in the North China Region and protect the exclusive right to use trademarks and brand names.

Article 2　Any commodity produced by factories in this region, as well as commodities processed, selected, or wholesaled by commercial firms, that wish to exclusively use a trademark, shall apply for registration in accordance with these measures.

Article 3　From the date of registration, the registrant shall obtain the exclusive right to use the trademark.

The exclusive right to use a trademark is limited to the registered design and the designated goods.

Article 4　The exclusive period for a trademark shall be 20 years from the date of registration.

The aforementioned exclusive period may be extended upon application in accordance with the provisions of this law, but each extension shall still be limited to 20 years.

Article 5　The exclusive right to use a trademark may be transferred to others along with its business. It may also be transferred partially along with the goods using the trademark.

Article 6　In addition to being revoked by the registrant at any time, the exclusive right to use a trademark may be revoked if any of the following circumstances occur after registration:

　　1.　Changing the registered trademark without authorization.
　　2.　Failing to use the registered trademark for one full year or discontinuing its use for two full years after registration without justifiable reason.
　　3.　Failing to apply for registration within one full year after the trademark right has been transferred, except for transfers due to inheritance.

Article 7　When the business is terminated during the exclusive period of the trademark, the exclusive right to use the trademark shall be extinguished.

Article 8　A registration certificate shall be issued for trademarks that have been approved for registration.

Article 9　If a trademark applied for registration is deemed legal after examination, the applicant shall be notified by a letter of approval, and it shall be published in the Trademark Gazette. Registration shall only proceed after two months have passed with no objections from interested parties, or after the objections have been clarified.

Article 10　If an interested party believes that a trademark approved for registration after the announcement period infringes on their registered trademark, they may request a ruling from the Department of Industry and Commerce.

Article 11　If two or more persons apply for registration of the same or similar trademark for the same commodity, or if the names are the same but the marks are different, the one who applied first shall be permitted to register.

Article 12　The applicant shall pay the prescribed registration fee when applying for trademark registration or extending the exclusive period. However, if the application is rejected, it shall be refunded.

Article 13　The authority to approve or reject trademark registration belongs to the Department of Industry and Commerce of this Government. However, due to the wartime environment and the vastness of the region, trademark registration applications may be submitted to the Industrial and Commercial Bureaus of each Administrative Office or to the Municipal Industrial and Commercial Bureaus equivalent to the Administrative Office for the convenience of merchants and people. After examination and deemed legal, the applicant shall be notified by a letter of approval, and the Department of Industry and Commerce of this Government shall be reported. Those approved shall be handled in accordance with the provisions of Article 9.

Article 14　Trademark registration certificates approved by local governments in various places before the promulgation of these measures shall be deemed valid. However, the local government must report the registration register and old certificates to the Department of Industry and Commerce of this Government within two months after the promulgation of these measures, and then issue new certificates.

Article 15　For towns and cities liberated by our army, the original trademark registration certificates of merchants and people must be submitted to the Industrial and Commercial Office of the Administrative Office or the Municipal Industrial and Commercial Bureau equivalent to the Administrative Office for registration within two months after liberation (for those already liberated, within two months after the promulgation of these measures), and then forwarded to the Department of Industry and Commerce of this Government for replacement with new certificates, which shall take effect from the time of replacement.

Article 16　When replacing registration certificates in accordance with Articles 14 and 15, if there is similarity in the design or name with other registered trademarks, the Department of Industry and Commerce may rule according to the order of production, the quality, and the quantity. Those not approved shall be revoked or ordered to change the trademark and apply for registration separately.

Article 17　Merchants who have not obtained a business license shall not apply for trademark registration. If applying for trademark registration with proprietary medicine, a certificate of inspection from the local health administration authority must be attached.

Article 18　All registered trademarks shall be marked on the packaging or goods with "Trademark Registration Certificate No. ×, Department of Industry and Commerce, North China People's Government."

Article 19　The detailed rules for the implementation of these measures shall be separately determined.

Article 20　These measures shall be implemented from the date of promulgation. The trademark registration measures promulgated by various places before the promulgation of these measures shall be abolished.

　　　　Implementing Rules for the North China Region Trademark Registration Measures
