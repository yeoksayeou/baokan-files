Xinhua News Agency, Beiping, June 26th: Since Beiping's public factories began establishing security work in April under the direction of the Beiping Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, some progress has been made. Some factories have organized pickets and security committees to lead the pickets. Workers have also begun to recognize the importance of security work and have carried out some activities. However, it has not yet attracted widespread attention from all enterprises and factories. According to materials obtained by the preparatory committee of the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions, only eight of the city's twenty-one public factories have established security committees. Some factories have perfunctorily renamed their air defense organizations as pickets. Some factories even rely solely on the original pre-liberation factory police and mine police, which have not yet been reformed, to carry out factory security work. Some factory leaders are ideologically paralyzed and are not active or serious in organizing factory security work. The publicity and education for security work has not been carried out well in most factories. When organizing pickets, some factories held meetings one day and formed teams the next, and the composition of the personnel participating in the pickets was complex and ideologically confused. In order to overcome the above shortcomings and strengthen factory security work, the Security Department of the Industrial Union of the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions Preparatory Committee recently convened a meeting of security work cadres from various public factories. In addition to solemnly pointing out the above shortcomings, it was explained that while the enemies with guns have been defeated, the hidden enemies will still attempt to carry out various conspiracies and sabotage activities, and we must not be paralyzed. Trade union cadres should first be vigilant, strengthen the education of all employees on security work, strengthen leadership in security work, establish a certain organizational form, organize security committees and security teams, and oppose the laissez-faire attitude. The selection of factory security team members must be cautious. Those designated by the leading organs must have their consent, those who volunteer must be strictly examined, and those who are elected must meet certain conditions.

　　平市公营工厂保卫工作干部开会
  　加强工厂保卫工作
    大部工厂至今放任麻痹　会议郑重号召组织起来
    【新华社北平二十六日电】北平各公营工厂在中共北平市委指示下于四月份开始建立保卫工作以来，已得到部分成绩。有些工厂已经组织了纠察队，也组织了领导纠察队的保卫委员会，工人也开始认识了保卫工作的重要性，作了一些活动。但是至今还没有引起所有企业、工厂普遍的注意。据市职工总会筹委会所得材料，全市二十一个公营工厂中，只有八个成立了保卫委员会。有的工厂把防空组织改称为纠察队，敷衍了事；有的工厂甚至仅仅依靠解放前原有的而现在未经改造的厂警队、矿警队来做保卫工厂的工作。有的工厂领导人思想麻痹，对组织工厂保卫工作不积极，不认真。各工厂普遍地没有很好地进行保卫工作的宣传教育。在组织纠察队时，有的工厂头天开会，第二天就编队，参加纠察队人员的成份复杂，思想混乱。市职工总会筹委会产业工会保卫部为克服上述缺点，加强工厂保卫工作，特于日前召集各公营工厂的保卫工作干部开会，除郑重指出上述的缺点以外，并说明：拿枪的敌人是失败了，但潜伏的敌人却仍会企图进行各种阴谋破坏活动，我们千万不能麻痹。工会干部应首先警惕起来，对全体职工加强保卫工作的教育，对保卫工作应加强领导，建立一定的组织形式，组织保卫委员会和保卫队，反对采取放任自流的态度。选择工厂保卫队员一定要慎重，由领导机关指定者必须经本人同意，自报者必须经过严格审查，选举者一定要有条件。
