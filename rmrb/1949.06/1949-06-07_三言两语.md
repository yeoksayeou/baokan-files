Brief Comments
　　Guarantee Every Grain Returns to the Granary

    Organizing militia joint defense and launching mass wheat protection movements during the wheat harvest season to ensure "every grain returns to the granary" is a very necessary task. This spring, North China generally experienced little rain, and some areas suffered hail and insect plagues, resulting in poor wheat harvests. Leaders at all levels must seriously and conscientiously do a good job in the wheat harvesting work, prevent sabotage by bandits and special agents, prevent petty theft, and protect rural production order. In addition, waste of wheat should be avoided, and the difficulties of families of revolutionary martyrs and soldiers who lack labor should be taken care of by organizing proxy harvesting. The weeding of autumn crops should also be done in a timely manner. This is a tense stage, and all efforts must be made to guarantee the fruits of the farmers' year-long hard work!

　　保证粒粒归仓
    在麦收时节组织民兵联防，展开群众性的护麦运动；保证“粒粒归仓”，是一桩十分必要的工作。今春华北各地普遍少雨，若干地区又遭雹灾、虫灾，麦子已经歉收，各地领导方面必须严肃认真把收麦工作作好，防止匪特破坏，防止小偷窃收，保卫农村生产秩序；此外还应避免麦子浪费，照顾烈军属缺乏劳动力的困难，组织代收，秋季农作物的锄苗工作也应作到不误农时，这是一个紧张阶段，要用一切努力保证农民一年辛勤劳动的果实！
