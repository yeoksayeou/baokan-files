　　[Jinan Telegram] Guangzong County Committee is implementing measures to protect and replenish seedlings, promptly correcting the peasants' deviation of "destroying seedlings." The County Committee went deep into various villages for inspection and found that some villagers had little confidence in protecting cotton seedlings, and individual households plowed them under to plant late seedlings because the cotton seedlings were easily destroyed by the wind. For example, one farmer in Dongshao Village, Second District, plowed under eight fen of cotton and replanted with soybeans. In Xima Village, Fourth District, several families were already plowing; Liu Quanzhai alone plowed ten mu. After the local leading cadres discovered this, they immediately persuaded the farmers to stop plowing, using the example of Caoying's cotton planted after Grain Full last year still yielding eighty jin, and cotton planted on wheat stubble in Nangong, to educate them, explaining that destroying cotton seedlings and replanting after the rain was a case of saving a little and losing a lot, and those with uneven cotton seedlings could find ways to replant, advocating replanting late cotton. The local farmers have now become aware, and the phenomenon of plowing seedlings has stopped.
    [Taiyue Telegram] After the seedlings in some areas of Yuebei were damaged by frost, replanting has been completed. In the Second District of Huo County, more than 2,000 mu of cotton seedlings were killed by frost. District and village cadres concentrated their efforts to lead replanting and replenishing, and completed the planting in five days. Now the new cotton seedlings have emerged again. In the process of replanting, the cadres in the district first paid attention to solving the difficulty of cotton seeds. In the past, farmers were accustomed to selling all the remaining cotton seeds to oil mills after planting. After the disaster, the district office sent people to negotiate with the oil mills, stipulating that the cotton seeds should be squeezed into oil after the planting was completed. They also notified the households in each village that lacked seeds to come to the designated oil mills to collect seeds. They also mobilized farmers to lend to each other, so that no household was delayed due to lack of seeds. Secondly, men and women, old and young, were mobilized to go to the fields to carry water and plant, without missing the solar term, ensuring the full emergence of seedlings. "Plant by Grain in Ear of the fourth month, if you don't plant, you'll have to rush to plant by Grain in Ear of the fifth month." This year, Grain in Ear falls on the tenth day of the fifth lunar month, so replanting is not too late.

　　广宗抓紧保苗　岳北完成补种
    【冀南电】广宗县委贯彻保苗补苗，及时纠正农民“毁苗”偏向。该县县委深入各村检查，发现有的村农民对棉花保苗信心不大，个别户因棉苗易被风吹毁而犁掉另耩晚苗。如二区东绍村一户农民，犁了八分棉花改种豆子。四区洗马村已发现几家正在犁着，仅刘全砦一人即犁了十亩。当地领导干部发觉后，立即说服农民停犁，以曹营去年小满后种的棉尚收八十斤及南宫种麦茬棉花等实例来进行教育，说明毁了棉苗等雨另种是因小失大的做法，棉苗不齐者可想法补种，提倡补种晚棉。现当地农民已经觉悟，犁苗现象已停止。
    【太岳电】岳北部分地区冻坏田苗后，已补种完毕。霍县二区冻死棉苗两千余亩，区村干部集中力量领导重种、补种五天便种完了。现在新的棉苗又已出土。该区干部在补种中，首先注意解决了棉籽的困难。过去农民习惯，种完以后，便把剩余棉籽都卖给油坊，灾情发生后，区公所便派人到油坊讲妥，棉籽要等种完了再榨油。又通知各村缺籽户，到指守的油坊来取籽。又发动农民互借。使各户都没因缺籽误事。其次是发动了男女老少齐下地担水点种，不误节令，保证了出苗齐全。“四月芒种、不种，五月芒种、急种。”今年是阴历五月初十芒种，因此补种还不算迟。
