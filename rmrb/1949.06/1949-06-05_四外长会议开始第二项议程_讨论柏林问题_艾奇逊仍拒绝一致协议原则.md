Xinhua News Agency, Peiping, June 4th: Reports from various sources state that the Paris Four Foreign Ministers Conference transitioned from open to closed sessions for the first time on the 3rd, with Soviet Foreign Minister Vyshinsky chairing the meeting to discuss the proposals on the Berlin issue put forward by the Soviet and American delegations.

Due to the deadlock in discussing the first agenda item, the Foreign Ministers Conference has suspended discussions on the issue of German unification, which will be resumed later. On June 1st and 2nd, the Foreign Ministers Conference began the second agenda item – discussions on Berlin and currency issues.

After the discussion began, Vyshinsky reiterated the Soviet side's previous proposals. The Soviet proposals stipulated: (1) Restoration of the Allied Joint Command in Berlin to coordinate measures for the administration of the entire city of Berlin and ensure the normal life of the entire city. (2) Restoration of the Berlin City Council; the date of elections for the entire Berlin Municipal Council will be considered by the Berlin Allied Command.

U.S. Secretary of State Acheson also put forward five proposals endorsed by the British and French Foreign Ministers. The U.S. proposals stipulated: (1) City-wide elections will be held in Berlin under four-power control, based on the election procedures used in October 1946. (2) The municipal institutions established as a result of the new elections must be temporary. (3) This municipal institution will operate based on the organizational structure stipulated in the Provisional Constitution of Greater Berlin of August 1946. However, in this item, the United States advocates amending Article 36 of the constitution. The original text of Article 36 states that the autonomy of Greater Berlin shall, except in certain specific circumstances, be subject to the Allied Command and the military government of specific areas. Article 36 further stipulates that all legislation passed by the City Council and decrees and orders promulgated by the City Government shall comply with the laws and orders promulgated by the Allied authorities in Germany and the Allied Command of Greater Berlin, and must be approved by them. (4) Authorize the newly elected Berlin City Council to draft a permanent constitution for Greater Berlin. (5) Simultaneously with the restoration of the provisional municipal institutions in Berlin, the four-power command should be rebuilt. However, in this U.S. proposal, they do not intend to rebuild the Allied Command on its previous basis, but actually establish a new institution. The text of the U.S. proposal points out that the Allied Command must work "according to the principles to be formulated by the Four Foreign Ministers at this session." Considering that Acheson had previously opposed applying the principle of unanimity in the Allied Command and demanded that it be replaced by a majority vote, the true meaning of this proposal is very clear.

Regarding the issue of rebuilding the Berlin Allied Command, the Foreign Ministers held a general debate, the focus of which was whether to adopt the principle of unanimity.

### 四外长会议开始第二项议程　讨论柏林问题　艾奇逊仍拒绝一致协议原则

　　四外长会议开始第二项议程
  　讨论柏林问题
  　艾奇逊仍拒绝一致协议原则
    【新华社北平四日电】各方报道：巴黎四国外长会议已于三日由公开会议首次转为秘密会议，苏外长维辛斯基任主席，讨论苏联和美国代表团关于柏林问题所提的建议。
    由于在讨论第一项议程时的僵持不决，外长会议已暂停关于德国统一问题的讨论，容后再行恢复。六月一日、二日，外长会议开始第二项议程——柏林与货币问题的讨论。
    在讨论开始以后，维辛斯基重申苏联方面前此的建议。苏联的建议规定：（一）恢复柏林各盟国联合司令部，以协调管理柏林全市范围的措施，并保证柏林全市的正常生活。（二）恢复柏林市议会；全柏林市政议会的选举日期问题，将交由柏林盟国司令部考虑。
    美国务卿艾奇逊也提出了由英法外长所赞同的五项建议。美国的建议规定：（一）以一九四六年十月所使用的选举程序为基础，在四国管制之下，在柏林举行全市选举。（二）由于新选举的结果而建立的市政机构，必须是临时的。（三）这个市政机构以一九四六年八月大柏林临时宪法所规定的组织结构为基础进行工作。但是，在这一项中，美国主张修改该宪法的第三十六条。第三十六条的原文声称：大柏林的自治，除某些特定情况之外，应服从盟国司令部及特定地区的军政府。第三十六条又规定，市议会所通过的一切立法以及市政府所颁布的法令与命令，应符合德境盟国当局、大柏林盟国司令部所颁布的法律及命令，并须经由它们批准。（四）授权新选出的柏林市议会草拟大柏林的永久宪法。（五）与恢复柏林临时市政机构同时，重建四国司令部。但是，在美国的这一建议中，他们并不想在以前的基础上重建盟国司令部，而是实际上建立一个新的机构。美国建议的条文指出，盟国司令部必须“根据四外长本届会议将拟定的原则”工作。如果想到艾奇逊前此曾反对在盟国司令部中运用一致协议原则而要求用多数表决的办法来加以代替时，则这个建议的真意就很清楚了。
    关于重建柏林盟国司令部问题，各外长曾进行了一般的辩论，辩论的焦点为是否应采取一致协议的问题。
