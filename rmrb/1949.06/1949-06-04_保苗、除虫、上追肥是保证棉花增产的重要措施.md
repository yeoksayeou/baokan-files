　　Protecting Seedlings, Eliminating Pests, and Applying Topdressing are Important Measures to Ensure Increased Cotton Production
    Ministry of Agriculture

    The drought during the cotton sowing season has presented serious difficulties for this year's expansion of cotton cultivation. However, thanks to the vigorous organization and leadership by various localities in leading farmers to carry out arduous drought-resistant sowing, according to current understanding, the entire region has completed about 80% of the cotton planting plan, reaching over ten million mu. Although the surface figures show that the original plan of twelve million mu has not been completed, it is indeed a great victory for the farmers to have organized to overcome the drought.

    After sowing, due to timely rainfall, cotton seedlings have emerged in various places. The agricultural proverb says, "Seeing the seedlings is three-tenths of the harvest," which proves that there is great hope for the cotton harvest. Our current task for cotton production is to consolidate the achieved results and strive for an additional increase of five catties of seed cotton per mu on top of the original production increase plan, in order to achieve the total output of this year's cotton planting plan—300 million catties. This requirement is highly likely to be completed. For the specific measures to complete this requirement, we must first protect seedlings and eliminate pests. Cotton has a saying, "Nine out of ten years have aphids." Currently, pests such as aphids and spider mites have continuously occurred in various places. Leaders at all levels should be vigilant, make full preparations in advance, and once pests occur, vigorously eliminate them. From the "Efficacy Test of Derris Powder for Preventing and Controlling Cotton Aphids" published in this issue today, it can be seen that although cotton aphids are severely harmful, after control, the cotton production can be increased by 50-100% compared to the cotton suffering from aphids. We have distributed and are grinding nearly 200,000 catties of derris powder to various places, and we hope that various localities will combine these effective insecticides with the effective traditional methods used by the masses for many years, mobilize the strength of the masses, and resolutely eliminate cotton pests. Other cotton diseases such as anthracnose, angular leaf spot, and seedling blight, although focusing on prevention in the treatment of cotton seeds, must not be relaxed if they occur, and should be controlled with effective agents such as cotton oil emulsion.

    At the same time, weeding and topdressing are important tasks for increasing production on the existing cotton field area. Weeding can prevent weeds, drought, and waterlogging, and also has pest control effects. "Weeding does not matter how many times, the more you weed, the better it looks." Farmers know this very well, and as long as they seize the season and provide leadership, it is relatively easy to carry out. The only difficulty is the lack of labor during the weeding season. It is necessary to mobilize women and other auxiliary labor to organize mutual assistance, and in areas where conditions permit, promote agricultural tools such as weeders and cultivators to adjust for the shortage of labor during the weeding season. In terms of cotton fertilization, the amount of fertilizer applied has generally decreased in recent years. In some areas, farmers are accustomed to planting cotton without applying fertilizer, which affects the yield and quality of cotton. Various localities should consider the soil fertility and the amount of base fertilizer applied in local cotton fields, and prepare quick-acting fertilizers such as oil cakes, bean cakes, and fertilizer powder to sell or lend to farmers for topdressing when the cotton grows to five or six inches tall or before flowering at the latest. For cotton farmers with poor soil quality and no fertilization habits, it is necessary to patiently enlighten them, break their conservative old habits, and help them apply topdressing well.

    The above matters are several important keys to strive for increased cotton production this year, and are of decisive significance for ensuring the supply of textile raw materials and improving the lives of cotton farmers. We hope that various localities will use a more powerful force than leading drought-resistant sowing to fight for the final victory of cotton production.

　　保苗、除虫、上追肥是保证棉花增产的重要措施
    农业部
    棉花播种时期的亢旱，给今年扩大植棉以严重困难，但由于各地大力的组织领导农民进行艰苦的抗旱播种，根据目前了解情况估计，全区约已完成植棉计划的百分之八十，达一千万亩以上。单从表面数字看来，虽是未能完成原订一千二百万亩的计划，然而从组织起来战胜旱灾来说，则确是农民的一个伟大胜利。
    播种后，由于降雨及时，各地棉花都已出苗。农谚说“见苗三分收”足证棉收是有了很大希望。我们目前对于棉产的任务，是巩固既得成绩，和在此基础上争取于原增产计划之外，每亩再增产籽棉五斤，以达到今年植棉计划的总产量——三亿斤。这个要求是有极大可能完成的，我们为了完成这个要求的具体措施，首先要保苗除虫。棉花素有“十年九蚜”之说，目前的各地已不断发生虫害，如蚜虫、火蜘蛛等，各级领导应该提高警惕，预作充分准备，一旦虫害发生，要大力除虫。从今天本刊发表的“鱼藤粉防治棉蚜的功效试验”，可以看出棉蚜为害虽烈，但经过除治以后，较之遭受蚜害的棉花可增产５０—１００％。我们发到各地和正在磨制待发的鱼藤粉约有二十余万斤，希望各地要以这些有效的杀虫药剂结合群众多年来行之有效的土法，发挥群众力量，坚决扑灭棉花害虫。其他如炭疸、角斑、立枯等棉病，虽着重在处理棉籽上的预防，但如有发生也决不能放松，以棉油乳剂等有效药剂进行除治。
    同时锄苗和追肥，是在现有棉田面积上争取增产的重要工作。锄苗既可防荒、防旱、防涝，又有防虫作用“锄苗不论遍，越锄越好看”。农民深知这番道理，只要抓紧季节予以领导，较易进行，唯困难在于锄苗季节劳力缺乏，必须动员妇女以及其他辅助劳动力组织起来互助进行，并在有条件地区，推广耘锄、中耕器等农具，以调剂锄苗季节劳动力的不足。在棉花施肥量上，近年大都较前降低，还有些地区农民习惯于种棉不施肥，影响棉花产量与质量，各地应斟酌当地棉田土质肥瘠及基肥施肥量多寡情况，准备油饼、豆饼、肥田粉等速效肥料卖给或贷给农民在棉长五、六寸至迟开花以前施用追肥。对地质瘠薄，又无施肥习惯的棉农、要耐心启发，打破其保守的旧习而帮助其上好追肥。
    以上数事，是争取今年棉花增产的几个重要关键，对保证纺织原料的供给，棉农生活的提高，有决定意义，希各地以较之领导抗旱播种更为强大的力量，为取得棉产的最后胜利而斗争。
