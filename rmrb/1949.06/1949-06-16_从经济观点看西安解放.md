　　An Economic Perspective on the Liberation of Xi'an
    Han Shaosu

    Xi'an, known as the "Land Capital," has been liberated! The liberation of this historical city is of great significance militarily and politically; however, its economic significance may even surpass the military and political!

    From an industrial point of view: The majority of Northwest's various machinery industries are concentrated between Xi'an and Baoji. Xi'an has modern textile, leather, flour, and machine industries. Xianyang has textile industry. Following the western section of the Longhai Railway, Caishapo has complete textile, machine, flour, and chemical industries. The textile industry in Guozhen, and further west, Shilipu, has famous textile industries, including cotton and wool spinning. There is a paper industry, a machinery industry, and many small and medium-sized affiliated and derivative industries centered around these industries. About 75 kilometers north along the Bao-Ping Highway—from Baoji to Pingliang—is the Longxian Coal Mine, with rudimentary modern equipment, and whose coal production rivals that of the Xiantong Railway line north of Xianyang, but its reserves are far greater! About 30 kilometers south along the Bao-Han section of the Sichuan-Shaanxi Highway—from Baoji to Hanzhong—entering the Qinling Mountains to the east, there is a relatively well-known iron mine. Further south, about 100 kilometers away near Miaotaizi (Marquis Liu Temple), there is also an iron mine with good quality, all using indigenous smelting methods. Later, the Northwest Iron and Steel Company in Yimen Town, Baoji, and the Iron and Steel Plant in Shuangshipu, were established, but unfortunately, they were stopped before completion!

    These industries were all built after the July 7th Incident (start of WW2). Due to the easy availability of coal and iron, raw materials, and convenient transportation, this renowned "Qinbao Industrial Zone" was formed in eight years! It plays an important role in the construction of the Great Northwest!

    The "Qinbao Industrial Zone" was formed primarily by three main forces. First, the Yongxing Company, managed by the old Bank of China, and its affiliated industrial and mining enterprises, including the Chang'an Leather Factory, Xianyang Factory, Xianyang Packing Factory, Caishapo Textile Factory, Machine Factory, Flour Mill, Chemical Plant, Guozhen Textile Factory, and Longxian Coal Mine. Second, the Shenxin-owned cotton mill, wool mill, cotton weaving mill, woolen weaving mill, machine factory, flour mill, and paper mill. Third, various private enterprises led by the Dahua Yarn Factory. The industry in this zone is mainly based on textiles and flour. During the War of Resistance Against Japan, the textile industry here ranked first in the Great Rear Area.

    From an agricultural point of view: The Guanzhong area, centered on Xi'an, is one of the famous "granaries" of the Great Northwest. Due to the successive completion of the "Eight Benefits of Guanzhong," the crisscrossing rivers and canals have promoted a surge in arable land! The main agricultural products are wheat and cotton. The former supported the military supplies and civilian food in central Shaanxi, and parts of Henan and Shanxi during the War of Resistance Against Japan. The latter not only supplied textile raw materials to the Qinbao Industrial Zone but was also frequently transported to Sichuan to supply various yarn factories in Chengdu and Chongqing. At one time, it was even transported to Kunming as the main source of raw materials for the Yudian Yarn Factory! In addition, the variety and quality of other agricultural products can compete with the interior!

    From a transportation point of view: After the liberation of Xi'an, the Longhai and Baotian Railways are expected to be connected in the near future. This major artery, starting from Lianyungang in the east and ending in Tianshui in the west, running across central China, will add a unique color to the new China in economic terms! The liberation of Baoji in the coming days will further strengthen the control of the Shaanxi-Sichuan and Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia highway networks! The combination of highways and railways will unleash its unparalleled power for the restoration and development of the Great Northwest!

    From a financial point of view: The financial systems of Shaanxi, Gansu, Ningxia, and Qinghai, have their headquarters in Xi'an. This was the case in the past, and it will be the case in the future! After the liberation of Xi'an, we have control of the Northwest financial headquarters. If we use it well, we can control the economies of the Northwest regions that are about to be liberated.

    From an economic perspective: According to the plan of water conservancy engineer Dr. Li Gengyan, utilizing the hydropower of the Yellow River at Yumengkou can immediately transform the Great Northwest and turn it into a modernized and industrialized region. At the same time, the Northwest has the petroleum of Yumen. According to investigations, the petroleum reserves near Pingliang are even greater than those of Yumen, and these are all driving forces for the construction of the Great Northwest!

　　从经济观点看西安解放
    韩少苏
    号称“陆都”的西安解放了！这一历史上名城的解放，在军事上、政治上的意义，固然很大；而其经济上的意义，或更超越军事和政治！
    从工业方面看：西北的各种机械工业，大部集中于西安、宝鸡之间，西安有现代化的纺织工业、制革工业、制粉工业、机器工业。咸阳有纺织工业、循陇海路西段西上，蔡家坡有设备完整的纺织工业、机器工业、制粉工业、化学工业。虢镇的纺织工业，稍西的十里铺，有著名的纺织工业，包括棉纺和毛纺。有制纸工业，机械工业，和围绕着这些工业为中心的许多中小规模的附属和派生工业。距此十里，以至宝鸡，为陕、川、甘、宁铁路和公路的枢纽。循宝平公路—宝鸡到平凉—北行七十五公里有粗具现代设备的陇县煤矿，和咸阳迤北咸同铁路线的煤产媲美，而其储藏量且远过之！循川陕公路宝汉段—宝鸡到汉中—南行三十公里处，东入秦岭有比较著名的铁矿，更南行百余公里处庙台子（留侯庙）附近山中亦有铁矿一处，质量尚佳，均系土法冶炼，其后虽有宝鸡益门镇的西北冶铁公司，和双石铺的冶铁厂，惜未完成即告停止！
    这些工业，都是从七七抗日后建设起来。由于煤、铁，原料易于取给和交通的利便，八年间蔚成了这驰名的“秦宝工业区”！在大西北的建设中，起着重要作用！
    “秦宝工业区”之所以形成，原来有三个主力军。第一，是旧中国银行管理的雍兴公司所属的各工矿，计有长安制革厂、咸阳工厂、咸阳打包厂、蔡家坡纺织厂、机器厂、面粉厂、化学厂、虢镇纺织厂、和陇县煤矿。第二，是申新所属的棉纺厂、毛纺厂、棉织厂、毛织厂、机器厂、面粉厂、造纸厂。第三，是以大华纱厂为首的各种私人企业。这一区的工业，以纺织、面粉为主。在抗日期间，这里的纺织工业，占大后方的第一位。
    从农业方面看：以西安为中心的关中地带，是大西北有名的“食粮仓库”之一，由于“关中八惠”的先后完成，纵横交织的河渠，促进了可耕地面的激增！主要的农产品为小麦与棉花，前者在抗日期间曾支持陕中和河南山西各一部的军糈和民食。后者不但供给了秦宝工业区的纺织原料，且经常的运入四川，供给成都和重庆的各纱厂，某一时期，更曾远运昆明，为裕滇纱厂原料的主要来源！此外，其他农产品种类之繁和质量之美，都可与内地相抗衡！
    从交通方面看：西安解放后，在最近的将来，陇海宝天两铁路便可望打通，这一东起连云港，西迄天水的横贯华中的大动脉，在经济方面将为新中国放一异彩！宝鸡不日解放，对于陕川、陕甘宁公路网的控制，更可加强！公路和铁路的结合，将为大西北建设的恢复和发展，发挥其无比的威力！
    从金融方面看：陕、甘、宁、青的金融系统，其总机构全在西安。过去如此，将来亦会如此！西安解放后，我们掌握了西北金融的总机构，善于运用，将可以控制正要解放的西北各地经济。
    从经济的远景看：据水利工程家李耕砚博士的计划，利用黄河禹门口水力发电，可使大西北立即改观，而变为现代化、工业化，同时西北有玉门的石油。据调查平凉附近石油的储藏量还超过玉门甚巨，这都是建设大西北的动力！
