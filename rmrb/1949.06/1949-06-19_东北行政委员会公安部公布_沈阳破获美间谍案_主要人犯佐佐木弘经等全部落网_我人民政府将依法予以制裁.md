Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, June 18th: The Public Security Department of the Northeast Administrative Committee recently announced the cracking of an American espionage case in Shenyang. The principal culprits, Sasaki Hirotsugu (Japanese), Boyan Cang (Mongolian), Wu Renjie (Sino-American, Chinese nationality), and others have all been apprehended. Six RD-type American-made AC/DC 15-watt transceiver sets, three generators, sixteen American espionage codebooks, ten American espionage funding gold ingots, three work plans, four letters of instruction, thirteen documents regarding the American TS espionage organization and personnel resumes, twenty-eight intelligence backups, and forty military maps and various charts were seized.

Before the complete liberation of the Northeast, the principal culprit Sasaki and others, under the direct command of the American espionage agency "Army Liaison Group" and the former American Consulate in Shenyang, engaged in espionage activities, collecting intelligence on the military, political, economic, and other aspects of our Northeast Liberated Area and Inner Mongolia. In October 1948, before the liberation of Shenyang, the culprits Sasaki, Cao Chengde, and others, upon receiving orders from the American Consulate and the Army Liaison Group, went underground, established secret radio stations, and continued their activities. After thorough investigation by our public security organs, the entire case was solved, and the evidence was conclusive. The principal culprit Sasaki and others confessed to their espionage and sabotage activities. The main facts of the case are now disclosed below:

　　　　Main Facts of the Case

The so-called American Army Liaison Group (Army Liaison Group, abbreviated as A·L·G·) was the publicly known name of the American imperialist espionage agency "External Survey Detachment 44 of the US Army Department in Shanghai" (External Survey Detachment 44, abbreviated as E·S·D·44), headquartered in Shanghai. After the Japanese surrender, under the name of A·L·G·, it followed Chiang Kai-shek's invading forces into the Northeast and established branch groups in Shenyang, Changchun, and other places, recruiting a large number of Japanese special agents, Mongolian and Han traitors to engage in espionage work against the Chinese people. Sasaki Hirotsugu (Chinese name Zhang Zhizhong, Japanese name Sakuma Kensuke, code name S·S·K·) was one of the Japanese special agents recruited by the A·L·G· Shenyang branch group. The culprit was a graduate of the Russian-Mongolian Department (special agent training class) of the Xing'an Military Officer School of the puppet Manchukuo Kwantung Army. During the puppet Manchukuo period, he engaged in special agent work in the Xing'an Mountains to sabotage the anti-Japanese war of the people of Northeast China. After "August 15th," he fled to Shenyang and served as an intelligence officer in the Second Department of Chiang Kai-shek's Ministry of National Defense. Later, he was introduced to the American Consulate in Shenyang and the A·L·G· Shenyang branch group to work as an American spy, directly contacting Nishida (Ni-shda), an American-Japanese assistant to the group leader Shen Lefu (Sing-laub, an American of German descent), and was ordered to recruit remnants of Japanese and puppet special agents and collect various intelligence from the Northeast Liberated Area and Inner Mongolia. The culprit handed over a total of seventy or eighty important pieces of intelligence to Nishida and directed an American espionage organization code-named T·S·. According to the draft of Sasaki's report to the American spy Nishida in April 1948 regarding the distribution of his organization, the special agent headquarters moved to Beiping in February 1948, with branches in Shenyang and Beiping. The intelligence strongholds under the Shenyang branch included eleven locations: Changchun, Harbin, Qiqihar, Mudanjiang, Tumen, Hailar, Manzhouli, and Hunchun. The Changchun branch of A·L·G· recruited the Mongolian traitor Boyan Cang (numbered T·O·A·S·4), ordering him to establish an intelligence station in Inner Mongolia to collect intelligence and conduct "defection" and sabotage work. The culprit went to Zhengjiatun, Liaoyuan County, in February 1947 to promote to Mongolian reactionaries that "only American and Chiang Kai-shek's help can solve the Inner Mongolia problem" in order to undermine the unity of the Chinese nation. Later, he established an intelligence station in Baichengzi, providing the American intelligence agency with detailed intelligence materials such as the organizational structure of our Inner Mongolia Autonomous Government, the names and resumes of key leaders, their daily routines, and photos of the political life of the Inner Mongolian people.

Another culprit, Wu Renjie, was introduced to the "Naval Liaison Branch" by Balanson (Barandson, Chinese name Bai Yingsheng), an American intelligence officer in Shenyang, and contacted Walsh to take on the task of intelligence transmission between Shenyang and Tianjin. Wu initially used his position as the English secretary of the puppet Northeast Political Affairs Committee of Chiang Kai-shek as a cover, and later appeared as a businessman, meeting with Welsh at the home of Fumijiro Huda, a Japanese professor retained at the puppet National Medical College in Shenyang, to receive intelligence letters. He then took the opportunity to fly to Tianjin and hand them over to Mrs. Kossov, a White Russian in the former British concession. Later, Wu lost contact with Welsh and was introduced by Shen Lefu to be led by American special agent Hunt.

    The Former American Consulate in Shenyang Was Actually an American Espionage Agency

In late October of last year, just before the complete liberation of the Northeast, the Shenyang branch group openly prepared to withdraw to Shanghai, and Sasaki, Cao Chengde, and others were ordered to formulate a plan to go underground. The main content of Sasaki's plan was to utilize the third force. The so-called third force was the remaining hidden personnel of the Japanese and Manchu special agents, including Kiichi Arisaka, Hajime Takeuchi, Xiaoting Xiao, Fangxin Wang, Chenglu Guo, Yuichi Yanai, Yoshiaki Yamamura, and Chengde Cao. Takeuchi and Xiao also worked as liaisons between Beiping and Shenyang, with the Allied Restaurant as the Shenyang contact point. Sasaki received two American-made small radio stations, one small generator, and one set of codebooks, nine gold ingots, and supplies such as flour, sugar, and rice as espionage funds from the liaison group. Nishida also ordered the culprit to pay attention to collecting information on the security forces in the Northeast and Inner Mongolia, as well as various regulations and identity certificates regarding travel. Cao Chengde's "Work Plan for Various Stations Under the Dongmeng Headquarters" planned to establish an intelligence headquarters in Shenyang, with liaison stations in Wangyemiao, Changchun, Siping, Jinzhou, Zhengjiatun, and Tongliao, with sixteen intelligence officers disguised as merchants to carry out espionage activities. The budget for expenses was: operating expenses of 12,000 yuan (gold yuan, same below) per month, travel expenses of 2,100 yuan per month, and intelligence fees calculated at two pieces of intelligence per station per month, averaging 100 yuan per piece, totaling 1,400 yuan. At the same time, the Shanghai headquarters of the group sent American spy Myadan to arrange Boyan Cang's underground work, and gave Boyan two portable American-made small radio stations, codebooks, and 300 US dollars in espionage funds, and sixteen bags of flour. Hunt also gave Wu Renjie two small American-made radio stations, one small generator, one set of codes, and a total of ten gold ingots and gold bars as espionage funds, and told him to use radio to contact Tianjin in the future. After the liberation of Shenyang, the culprits continued to arrange underground organizations and engage in espionage activities.

In December 1946, Wu Renjie accompanied American government special agent Balanson to Tongliao in the name of inspectors of the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration, under the pretext of investigating relief situations, collecting our military intelligence and providing it to the former American Consulate in Shenyang. Another American spy named Boer, who appeared under the name of liaison, also ordered Wu Renjie to collect intelligence from our liberated areas and the Soviet Union and provide it to the former American Consulate in Shenyang. In 1947, when Japanese nationals were repatriated, the American Consulate left Japanese special agent Sasaki behind to do espionage work for them, and issued a Japanese national ID card No. 177 issued by the Chiang Kai-shek puppet political affairs committee for the use of the American Consulate. In January 1948, Hunt, who succeeded Welsh in leading Wu Renjie, lived on the second floor of the American Consulate in Shenyang. Wu went to see him four times, and Hunt told him to go only after dark. On October 27, 1948, Hunt ordered Wu to go to the American Consulate at eight o'clock the next morning. Wu went on time, and Hunt used a jeep to transport the radio station, generator, and codes from the consulate to Wu's home.

The facts of the whole case and the various documents and evidence seized show that the so-called consulate and "Army Liaison Group" of the American government in Shenyang were actually American espionage agencies, and their purpose was to use Japanese special agents and Han and Mongolian traitors to carry out conspiratorial activities against the Chinese people in order to undermine the revolutionary cause of the Chinese people and world peace. Our People's Government will impose sanctions on the criminals in this case according to law.

　　东北行政委员会公安部公布
  　沈阳破获美间谍案
    主要人犯佐佐木弘经等全部落网
  　我人民政府将依法予以制裁
    【新华社沈阳十八日电】东北行政委员会公安部顷公布在沈阳破获美国间谍案。主要人犯佐佐木弘经（日本人）、伯彦苍（蒙古人）、吴人杰（中美混种，中国籍）等全部落网，并缴获ＲＤ式美造交流直流两用的十五瓦特收发报机六部，发电机三台，美国间谍密码十六本，美间谍经费金元宝十个，工作计划三件，指示信四封，美国ＴＳ间谍组织情况及人员履历书十三件，情报存底二十八份，军用地图及各种图表四十份。
    主犯佐佐木等在东北全部解放前，即在美国间谍机关“陆军联络团”及美国前驻沈领事馆的直接指挥下进行间谍活动，搜集我东北解放区和内蒙的军事、政治、经济等各方面的情报。于一九四八年十月间沈阳解放前，该犯佐佐木、曹成德等又接受美国领事馆及陆军联络团命令，潜伏“地下”，设立秘密电台，继续活动。经我公安机关周密侦察后，全案破获，证据确凿，主犯佐佐木等对其间谍破坏活动均供认不讳。兹将全案主要事实披露于后：
    　　　　全案主要事实
    所谓美国陆军联络团（Ａｒｍｙ　Ｌｉａｉ—ｓｏｎ　Ｇｒｏｕｐ简称Ａ·Ｌ·Ｇ·）是美帝国主义在华的间谍机关“美国陆军部上海四十四海外观察组”（Ｅｘｔｅｒｎａｌ　Ｓｕｒｖｅｙ　Ｄｅｔａｃｈｍｅｎｔ　４４简称Ｅ·Ｓ·Ｄ·４４）的对外公开名义，总部设上海。日本投降以后，即以Ａ·Ｌ·Ｇ·的名义随蒋匪进犯军来东北，先后在沈阳、长春等地设立分团，大量收罗日本特务人员、蒙汉奸细等从事反对中国人民的间谍工作。佐佐木弘经（中国化名张执中，日本化名佐久间健祐，代号Ｓ·Ｓ·Ｋ·）即为Ａ·Ｌ·Ｇ·沈阳分团所吸收的日本特务之一，该犯系伪满关东军兴安军官学校俄蒙科（特务训练班）出身，伪满时在兴安岭一带即进行破坏东北人民抗日战争的特务工作。“八一五”后，逃到沈阳，曾充当蒋匪国防部第二厅情报员。后又被介绍至沈阳美领事馆和Ａ·Ｌ·Ｇ·沈阳分团做美国间谍，直接与该分团团长沈乐甫（Ｓｉｎｇ—ｌａｕｂ，美籍德人）的助手美籍日人西田Ｎｉ—ｓｈｄａ联系，奉命吸收日伪特务残余，搜集东北解放区和内蒙等地的各种情报。该犯前后总共交给西田重要情报七八十份，并指挥一代号为Ｔ·Ｓ·的美国间谍组织。据佐佐木一九四八年四月间向美国间谍西田报告其组织分布情况的底稿所记载，特务本部三十七年二月迁北平，支部有沈阳、北平两处，沈阳支部所属情报据点有长春、哈尔滨、齐齐哈尔、牡丹江、图门、海拉尔、满洲里、珲春等十一处。Ａ·Ｌ·Ｇ·的长春分团则吸收了蒙奸伯彦苍（编号为Ｔ·Ｏ·Ａ·Ｓ·４），令其在内蒙设情报站，搜集情报，并做“策反”破坏工作。该犯曾在一九四七年二月到辽源县郑家屯向蒙古反动分子宣传“只有美蒋帮助才能解决内蒙问题”，以破坏中国的民族的团结。以后又在白城子设立了情报站，向美国情报机关提供了我内蒙人民自治政府的组织状况和主要负责人姓名、简历及生活规律，内蒙人民的政治生活照片等详细情报材料。
    另犯吴人杰，则为沈阳美国情报员巴兰森（Ｂａｒａｎｄｓｏｎ，华名白英生）介绍到“海军联络分团”与威尔斯（Ｗａｌｓｈ）联系，担任沈阳、天津间情报传递工作。吴犯最初以蒋匪东北伪政务委员会英文秘书职为掩护，后又以商人面目出现，与威尔斯在沈阳伪国立医学院留用的日籍教授封田文次郎家中接头，领取情报信件后，即乘机飞天津交旧英租界白俄考索夫太太（Ｍｒｓ．Ｋｏｓｓｏｖ），以后吴犯与威尔斯失掉关系，又由沈乐甫介绍，归美国特务人员亨特（Ｈｕｎｔ）领导。
    前美国驻沈领事馆实际是美间谍机关
    去年十月底，即东北全部解放前夕，该团沈阳分团公开部分准备撤退上海，佐佐木、曹成德等奉命拟定潜伏计划。佐佐木计划之主要内容为利用第三种势力。所谓第三种势力乃是日满特务残余潜伏人员，有坂下喜一、竹内始、萧耀庭、王芳信、郭成禄、柳井友一、山村嘉昭、曹成德等人。竹内始、萧耀庭二人兼做北平、沈阳间的交通工作，沈阳联络点为亚利餐厅。佐佐木由联络团领到美制小型电台两部，小型发电机一部及密码本一套，九个金元宝及白面、砂糖、大米等物资作间谍经费。西田并命令该犯注意搜集东北、内蒙等地的警备部队材料，及关于旅行方面的各种规定和身份证明书等的情报材料。曹成德所拟定之“东蒙本部所属各站工作计划书”，计划在沈阳设情报总站，王爷庙、长春、四平、锦州、郑家屯、通辽各地设联络站，情报员十六名，以行商面目为掩护，进行间谍活动。其经费预算：工作费每月一万二千元（金圆券，下同），旅费每月二千一百元，情报费按每站每月两份情报计算，每份平均百元，共一千四百元。与此同时，该团上海总部又派美国间谍密亚当（Ｍｙａｄａｎ）前来布置伯彦苍的潜伏工作，并交与伯犯二个能携带的美制小型电台、密码本及间谍经费三百元美金，十六袋面粉。亨特也同样交给吴人杰小型美制电台两部、小型发电机一台，密码一套，金元宝、金块共十个，作为间谍经费，并告诉他以后与天津改用电台联络。沈阳解放后，该犯等仍继续布置潜伏组织，进行间谍活动。
    一九四六年十二月，吴犯人杰随美国政府特务人员巴兰森，以联合国善后救济总署视察员名义，赴通辽一带以调查救济情况为名，搜集我军事情报，供给前驻沈美国领事馆。另一以联络名义出现的美国间谍伯尔，后亦授命吴人杰搜集我解放区及苏联的情报，供给前驻沈美国领事馆。一九四七年遣送日侨回国时，美国领事馆将日本特务佐佐木留下，为其做间谍工作，并通过蒋匪伪政务委员会发给美领事馆留用的政侨字一七七号日侨身份证一件。一九四八年一月，继威尔斯领导吴人杰的亨特，即住在沈阳美国领事馆的二楼。吴犯曾去找过四次，亨特嘱咐他必须在晚上天黑以后才去。一九四八年十月二十七日，亨特又令吴犯次晨八点到美国领事馆找他，吴按时去见，亨特即用吉普车把电台、发电机、密码等由领馆送到吴犯家中。
    全案事实及缴获的各种文件证据都说明美国政府在沈阳的所谓领事馆、“陆军联络团”，实际上是美国的间谍机关，其目的即在利用日本特务及汉奸、蒙奸进行反对中国人民的阴谋活动，以破坏中国人民的革命事业与世界和平。我人民政府对该案人犯将依法予以制裁。
