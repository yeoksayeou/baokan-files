Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, June 1st. To assist the Tangshan Kailuan Mining Bureau in resolving its operational difficulties, the North China People's Government, in addition to a loan of 600 million yuan in early May to pay off overdue wages, has recently arranged for the North China Trade Corporation to exchange 60,000 bags of flour and 12 million jin of coarse grains for the mine's coal production. This will enable the mine to settle the outstanding in-kind wages owed for the past four to five months. The flour was delivered in Tianjin on the 26th, and the coarse grains are being allocated in Tangshan in succession. The mine's trade union has now consulted with the mine management and agreed on a distribution plan, which will be completed before today (Dragon Boat Festival).
