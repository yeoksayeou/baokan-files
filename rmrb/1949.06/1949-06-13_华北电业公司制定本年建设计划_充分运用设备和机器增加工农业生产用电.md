The North China Electric Power Company Formulates This Year's Construction Plan
　　Fully Utilize Equipment and Machinery to Increase Electricity Consumption for Industrial and Agricultural Production

　　[This newspaper reports] An electric power construction plan that supports agricultural production increase, transportation development, and industrial construction has been formulated and is about to be implemented. At the North China Electric Power Company's expanded meeting from June 7th to 10th, three major construction issues were mainly resolved: The annual construction plan was adopted, the five-year construction plan was initially discussed, and the implementation of corporatization. The adopted annual construction plan is reported as follows:

　　The annual construction plan of the Electric Power Company focuses on repairing existing machinery, allocating necessary parts and accessories, fully utilizing the efficiency of existing equipment, and promptly installing existing machinery in North China that has not yet been used. In addition, it emphasizes measurement, investigation, and design work as preparation for the five-year plan. The following must be completed within this year according to the plan: (1) Strengthen the Hangu Substation to supply electricity for irrigation in the Lutai, Chadian, and Yangliuqing areas. (2) Restore the 77 kV transmission line from Tangshan to Guye to supply electricity for the aluminum and refractory material industries in the Guye area. In the future, expanding this line to Luanxian and Luojiatun can supply power for the Luojiatun hydropower construction and power irrigation downstream of the Luan River. (3) Add three 6,250 kVA transformers to the Tangshan Power Plant to increase power supply to Tianjin. (4) Rebuild the 10,000 kW cooling tower at Xiahuayuan, or utilize two existing 5,000 kW cooling towers from Shanghai, or use self-designed reinforced concrete cooling towers, all of which must be completed before this winter. (5) Construct transmission lines from Chengzi to Datai and Qingshuijian, and renovate the transmission line from Shijingshan to Chengzicun to supply electricity to coal mines in the Datai and Qingshuijian areas. (6) A connecting line needs to be built between Tianjin No. 1 Power Plant and No. 3 Power Plant, with the aim of exchanging 10,000 to 15,000 kW. (7) Construct a 550 kW power generation unit in Pingwang, Datong, and restore the transmission line from Pingwang to various mines. (8) Re-measure the Zijingguan hydropower plan, determine the design and construction procedures, and then proceed with construction immediately. (9) Re-survey the Luojiatun hydropower plan on the Luan River and determine the steps to be taken. Secondly, the following must be started this year and completed in 1950: (1) Start constructing the 77 kV transmission line from Xiahuayuan to Beiping, approximately 150 kilometers long, to transmit surplus power from the Xiahuayuan Power Plant for use in the Beiping area, and more importantly, to use surplus power in the Beiping area during the day to ensure the continuity of industrial electricity consumption in the Xuanhua area. (2) Strengthen the equipment of the Pingjin Tang power grid. (Items 3 and 4 omitted) (5) A steam turbine generator set currently located in Tianjin and Qinhuangdao is planned to be built in the Tianjin No. 4 Power Plant. Except for the missing exciter which needs to be resolved, the rest is relatively complete. (Item 6 omitted) (7) A 2,000 kW steam turbine generator set stored in Tangshan will be moved to the Linshui Power Plant of the Fengfeng Coal Mine Company. (8) If the staff of the Civil Engineering Department are adequately supplemented and strengthened, they can carry out the surveying of the Zhanghe Power Plant plan and reconnaissance of the Baihe Power Plant plan.

　　华北电业公司制定本年建设计划
  　充分运用设备和机器增加工农业生产用电
    【本报讯】一个配合农业增产，交通发展，工业建设的电业建设计划已经制定，即将开始执行。此次六月七日至十日的华北电业公司扩大会议上，主要解决了三个重大建设问题：通过了本年度建设计划，初步讨论了五年建设计划，及实行企业化。现将通过的本年度建设计划报道于后：
    电业公司的本年度建设计划是注意修理原有机器，配置必须配件及附件，充分发挥原有设备的效能，并将现存华北尚未运用的机器从速装置。此外并注重测量调查及设计工作，以做为五年计划的准备工作。计划中本年内必需完成的有：（一）加强汉沽变电站，以便供给芦台、茶淀、杨柳青一带农田灌溉的用电。（二）恢复唐山古冶七七千伏输电线，以备供给古冶区制铝和耐火材料工业等用电。将来此线扩展到滦县和罗家屯，可以供给罗家屯水力发电施工和滦河下游电力灌溉之用。（三）唐山发电所增加六、二五○千伏安变压器三具，以增加对天津的送电量。（四）重建下花园一万千瓦用冷水塔，或利用现存上海的五千千瓦冷水塔两套，或应用自己设计的钢筋水泥冷水塔，都要在今冬以前完成。（五）建设从城子到大台和清水涧的输电线，并改建石景山到城子村的输电线，供给大台和清水涧一带煤矿用电。（六）天津第一发电所与第三发电所之间，需增建联络线，以交换一万至一万五千千瓦为目的。（七）在大同平旺建设五五○千瓦发电设备一套，并恢复平旺至各矿的输电线。（八）复测紫荆关水力发电计划，确定设计和施工程序，以便随即进行建设。（九）复勘滦河罗家屯水力发电计划，确定进行步骤。其次，本年度必须开始以期在一九五○年内完成的：（一）开始建筑下花园至北平间的七七千伏的输电线路，约长一五○公里，以输送下花园发电所有余的电力，供北平区使用，更重要的以北平区白天有余的电力，保证宣化一带工业用电的持续性。（二）加强平津唐电力网设备。（三四项略）（五）现存天津及秦皇岛的汽轮发电机一套，拟建设于天津第四发电所内，除缺少励磁机需设法解决外，其余尚称完整。（六项略）（七）唐山所存二千千瓦汽轮发电机一套，移装于峰峰煤矿公司的临水发电所。（八）如土木课工作人员得到相当补充和加强，可以进行勘测漳河发电所计划，和踏勘白河发电计划。
