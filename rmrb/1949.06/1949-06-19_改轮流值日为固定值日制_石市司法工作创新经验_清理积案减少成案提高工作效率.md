Changing from Rotating Duty to Fixed Duty System
Shijiazhuang's Innovative Experience in Judicial Work
Clearing Backlogged Cases, Reducing New Cases, and Improving Work Efficiency

[Shijiazhuang Electric] During the "Red May" competition, the Shijiazhuang People's Court highly promoted the spirit of serving the people and created new experiences in judicial work. They improved the rotating duty system to a fixed duty system, rapidly clearing backlogged cases, reducing new cases, and improving work efficiency. At the beginning of Shijiazhuang's liberation, most of the court cadres came from rural areas and lacked experience in urban judicial work. When people came to file "lawsuits," they were accepted regardless of the urgency of the case, turning them into new cases. As a result, problems that could have been solved in a day or several days could not be resolved quickly. Important cases also lacked the time for more careful investigation and research. Therefore, in February of last year, a duty system was established, with judges taking turns on duty. According to the severity and urgency of the case, simpler disputes were handled at any time. If not completed on the same day, it was handed over to the next day's duty officer. Only important or complex cases were designated as new cases and handled by judges not on duty. This scientific division of labor greatly improved work efficiency and was praised by the North China People's Government. However, the rotating duty system still had many shortcomings, such as the daily change of personnel, troublesome handover procedures, repeated interrogations, and slow resolution of cases due to the involvement of several people. Delays would turn them into backlogged cases. At the same time, it was difficult for judges to manage their own schedules, making their work passive; they also could not better research and accumulate work experience, especially since delays affected mass production. After repeated studies, at the beginning of the "May Day" competition, a fixed duty system was implemented, with designated personnel responsible for specific tasks and a duty group formed. When people came to file "lawsuits," they were handled immediately, and if not completed in one day, they would continue the next day. If investigations were needed, they were carried out quickly; relatively important or complex problems that could not be resolved quickly were sent to the interrogation group after preliminary examination by the duty group. As a result, the number of new cases was greatly reduced. And the comrades in the interrogation group had ample time to conduct investigations and research, handle new cases according to their severity and urgency, and clear backlogged cases. In this way, on the one hand, the shortcomings of the rotating duty system were overcome; on the other hand, and more importantly, the passive situation in the interrogation group, where backlogged cases were not yet resolved while new cases became backlogged, began to be reversed, further improving the work. This is further proven by the case handling situation in March and May. In March (when the rotating duty system was implemented), a total of 250 cases were received, 187 of which were handled by duty officers, and 63 became new cases; in May (when the fixed duty system was implemented), 222 cases were received, 216 of which were handled by duty officers, and only 6 became new cases. Therefore, mass disputes were quickly and correctly resolved, which not only did not affect production but also relieved the masses of their mental burden. The masses all said: The court is truly a "People's Court" that works for them.

(Editor's note: This new creation of the Shijiazhuang People's Court in judicial work has been praised by the North China People's Government during the work process; the responsible comrades of the North China People's Court believe that this experience is worth learning from in various regions.)

　　改轮流值日为固定值日制
  　石市司法工作创新经验
    清理积案减少成案提高工作效率
    【石家庄电】石家庄人民法院红五月竞赛中，高度发扬了为人民服务精神，司法工作上创造了新经验。改进轮流值日制为固定值日制，迅速清理积案，减少成案，工作效率提高了一步。石市解放之初，法院干部多数来自农村，对城市司法工作缺乏经验，打“官司”的来了，不分轻重缓急，一律收下，成为成案。致使当日或数日可解决的问题，亦不能迅速得到解决。重要案件也无暇更仔细地进行调查研究。乃于去年二月建立值日制，审判员轮流值日，根据案情轻重缓急，较简单的纠纷随时处理，当日不完交第二日值班人处理，重要的或复杂案件才定为成案，由不值班的审判员处理。这种科学的分工，使工作效率大为提高，曾受到华北人民政府的表扬。但轮流值日制仍然存在不少缺点，如每天换人，交待手续麻烦，审讯时重复，一个案件经过几个人，解决的慢，拖下去就变成积案。同时审判员自己计划难于掌握，工作形成被动；也不能更好地进行研究积累工作经验，特别是拖延时日，影响群众生产。经过多次研究，遂于“五一”竞赛开始，实行固定值日制，在分工的基础上，确定专人负责，组成值日组。打“官司”的来了随即处理，一日不完，次日继续进行；需要调查的，很快的进行调查；不能很快解决的比较重要的或复杂的问题，经过值日组初审就传送审讯组。因而成案大大减少。而审讯组同志也就有了充裕时间进行调查研究，分别轻重缓急处理成案，清理积案。这样一方面克服了轮流值日制的缺点；又一方面，更重要的是开始转变了审讯组积案尚未处理完结，而新案又变成积案的被动局面，使工作又进了一步。这一点又以从三月和五月处理案件的情况中得到证明，三月份（实行轮流值日制时）接案共二百五十件，由值日处理的一百八十七件，成案六十三件；五月份（实行固定值日制时）接案二百二十二件，由值日处理的二百十六件，成案仅六件。因此，群众纠纷很快得到正确解决，既不影响生产，又解除了群众精神负担。群众都说：法院真是替他们办事的“人民法院”。
