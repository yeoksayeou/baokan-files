　　The Legal Committee of the CPC Central Committee, Ministry of Justice of the North China People's Government Convene Meeting
  　Symposium on New Legislation Issues
    Unanimously Agreed: Mao Zedong Thought Should Guide New China's Legislative Principles. Organize Ten Groups to Study the Constitution, Civil and Criminal Laws, etc. Use New Perspectives and Methods to Conduct Legislative Work

    [Special Dispatch from this Newspaper] The symposium on legal issues convened by the Legal Committee of the CPC Central Committee and the Ministry of Justice of the North China People's Government was held on June 4th and 10th. Attendees included responsible persons from the Legal Committee of the CPC Central Committee, the Ministry of Justice of the North China People's Government, the North China People's Court, the Beijing People's Court, and experts and professors such as Shen Junru and Li Da, totaling more than forty people. The meeting was chaired by Xie Juezai, Minister of Justice of the North China People's Government. First, the person in charge of the Legal Committee of the CPC Central Committee gave a general explanation of the legislative needs, legislative viewpoints, legislative methods, and legislative forms of the New Democratic People's Democratic Republic of China. Attendees broadly exchanged various opinions on the legislative issues of the new China at the two symposiums. After heated discussions, everyone unanimously agreed that the New Democratic Revolution is about to triumph nationwide, the great construction work of the People's Democratic New China is actively underway, the Kuomintang's counter-revolutionary and anti-people Six Codes have been abolished, and the New Democratic state must have various laws to protect its political system, economic system, and cultural system. Currently, the laws that judicial organs and the people feel are most needed are: Criminal Law, Criminal Procedure Law, Civil Law, Civil Procedure Law, Court Organization Law, Regulations on the Procuratorate System, new regulations on prisons or prisoner rehabilitation, etc.; the laws that judicial organs and the business community jointly feel are urgently needed are: Company Law, Negotiable Instruments Law, Commercial Registration Law, Exchange Law, Trademark Law, Maritime Law; in addition, the Marriage Law, Labor Law, Land Law, etc., are also urgently needed by the people. The research of new jurisprudence, the research of the new constitution and administrative law, and the research of legal history and legal system history are also necessary. When talking about how to carry out legislative work with new viewpoints and methods, everyone believed that the new legislation should proceed from the actual reality of the new China's life and combine theory with practice. Therefore, Mao Zedong Thought, which most completely and centrally reflects China's reality and most correctly guides the Chinese revolution, should become the guiding principle of legislative work. Specifically: First, we should recognize the nature of the Chinese New Democratic Revolution and the New Democratic state, that is, recognize that the object of this revolution is imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism; the state established by the victory of this revolution is a people's democratic dictatorship led by the proletariat and based on the worker-peasant alliance; only by recognizing these can we accurately reflect the class nature and social content of this revolution and this state in legislative work. Second, we should clearly understand the policy characteristics of New Democracy, which are the policies in all directions as instructed by Chairman Mao, in order to appropriately reflect the characteristics of the policy of "considering both public and private interests, benefiting both labor and capital, helping each other in urban and rural areas, and exchanging internally and externally" in legal form. Third, we should recognize the future development of New Democratic China and recognize that New Democratic China is a preparatory stage and a transitional stage for socialist China, so that the current struggle and future goals of the Chinese people can be organically embodied in legislative work. Fourth, we should study the experience of the Chinese Communist Party, the Chinese People's Political Power, and the Chinese People's Liberation Army in legislative and judicial work for more than 20 years, summarize and improve these experiences, and become more complete legislative content. Everyone emphasized that to do a good job in legislative work, we must earnestly understand the life and needs of the Chinese people, we must carefully study the policies and experiences of the Chinese revolution, and we must earnestly and systematically study Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought. At the same time, everyone believed that our legislative work must, on the one hand, take the legal theories and laws of the Soviet Union and various people's democratic countries as the main reference materials and objects of learning; on the other hand, take various old laws of China in the past and various laws of European and American capitalist countries as auxiliary reference materials and objects of criticism. Therefore, everyone proposed that the collection, compilation, and arrangement of various jurisprudence and legal books and materials should be carried out immediately. Finally, everyone believed that under the current conditions, the form of legislation should mainly be various general rules and simple regulations. At the same time, the complexity and simplicity of the content of various laws and the number of articles should be specifically determined according to needs and possibilities; with the progress of various construction projects of the People's Democratic state, the content and form of various laws will gradually be supplemented and developed. In the future, the legal language should also strive to be scientific and popular so that the law can be transformed from a tool exclusively owned by a few so-called legal experts into a tool for serving the people and being used by the people.
    The meeting agreed to immediately organize ten research groups including: Jurisprudence, Constitution (including administrative law), Civil Regulations, Criminal Regulations, Commercial Regulations, Court Organization Regulations, Enforcement Regulations, Procuratorial Regulations, International Law and Legal System History, etc. Each person voluntarily joined one to two groups to be responsible for research work. On the spot, each person signed up to participate and separately elected conveners for each group.

　　中共中央法律委员会、华北人民政府司法部召集会议
  　座谈新立法问题
    一致认为：毛泽东思想指导应成为新中国的立法原则组织十个组研究宪法民刑等法规　用新的观点方法进行立法工作
    【本报特讯】由中共中央法律委员会和华北人民政府司法部所召集之法律问题座谈会，于六月四日、十日连续举行两次会议。出席者有中共中央法律委员会、华北人民政府司法部、华北人民法院、北平市人民法院各负责人及沈钧儒、李达等专家教授四十余人。会议由华北人民政府司法部长谢觉哉主席。首由中共中央法律委员会负责人概括地说明新民主主义的中华人民民主国家的立法需要、立法观点、立法方法以及立法方式等问题。到会人于两次座谈会上广泛地交换了关于新中国立法问题的各种意见。经过热烈讨论后，大家一致认为：新民主主义革命即将在全国范围内胜利，人民民主新中国的伟大建设工作正积极进行，国民党的反革命的反人民的六法全书已被废除，新民主主义国家必须有保护自己的政治制度、经济制度与文化制度的各种法律。当前司法机关与人民群众感觉到最需要的法律是：刑法、刑事诉讼法、民法、民事诉讼法、法院组织法、检察制度条例、新的监狱或犯人改造的条例等；司法机关与工商界共同感到迫切需要的法律是：公司法、票据法、商业登记法、交易所法、商标法、海商法；此外，婚姻法、劳动法、土地法等亦为人民迫切需要。新法理学的研究、新宪法与行政法的研究、法学史法制史的研究，也都有其必要。谈到如何以新的观点和方法进行立法工作问题，大家认为：新立法应该从新中国的现实生活的实际出发，并使理论与实际相结合，因此，最完满地最集中地反映中国现实和最正确地指导中国革命的毛泽东思想，应成为立法工作的指导原则。具体地说：首先应认清中国新民主主义革命和新民主主义国家的性质，也即是说认清这个革命的对象是帝国主义、封建主义和官僚资本主义；这个革命胜利建立起来的国家是以无产阶级为领导，工农联盟为基础的人民民主专政的国家；认清了这些才能在立法工作中确切地反映出这个革命和这个国家的阶级本质和社会内容。第二，应该清楚了解新民主主义的政策特点，是毛主席所指示的四面八方的政策，以便用法律形式恰当地反映出“公私兼顾、劳资两利、城乡互助、内外交流”的政策的特点。第三，应该认清新民主主义中国发展的前途，认清新民主主义中国是社会主义中国的准备阶段和过渡阶段，以便在立法工作中把中国人民当前奋斗与将来目的有机地体现出来。第四，应研究中国共产党、中国人民政权与中国人民解放军二十余年的立法工作与司法工作的经验，把这些经验总结起来和提高起来，成为较完备的立法内容。大家都强调要想搞好立法工作，必须认真了解中国人民的生活和需要，必须详细研究中国革命的政策和经验，必须认真地和系统地去学习马克思列宁主义和毛泽东思想。同时大家认为我们的立法工作必须一方面以苏联和各人民民主国家的法学理论和法律作为主要参考材料和借鉴对象；另方面以中国过去各种旧法律与欧美资本主义国家各种法律作为附属参考材料和批判对象，因而大家提议应立即进行各种法学、法律图书资料的搜集、编译和整理工作。最后，大家认为在目前条件下，立法形式应以各种大总及简易条例形式为主，同时，各种法律的内容繁简与条文多少，应具体地看需要与可能而定；随着人民民主国家各种建设进程底进展，各种法律的内容与形式也将逐渐补充和发展。今后法律文字方面，也须力求科学化、大众化，使法律从少数所谓法律专家专有的工具，变为为人民服务为人民运用的工具。
    会议同意立即组织：法理学、宪法（包括行政法在内）、民事法规、刑事法规、商事法规、法院组织法规、执行法规、检察条例、国际法与法制史等十个研究组，由各人自愿参加一个至两个组负责进行研究工作。当场各人即报名参加，并分别推定各组召集人。
