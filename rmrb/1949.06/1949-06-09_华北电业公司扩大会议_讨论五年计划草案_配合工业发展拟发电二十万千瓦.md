　　North China Electric Power Company Enlarged Meeting
  　Discusses Draft Five-Year Plan
    Coordinating with Industrial Development to Generate 200,000 Kilowatts
    [Our Dispatch] The North China Electric Power Company held its second day of an expanded meeting (June 8) and preliminarily discussed the Five-Year Plan. The plan included proposals for utilizing existing unused machinery in the North China region to address urgent electricity needs, as well as plans for the organizational structure of the general and branch companies and various relationships. The meeting began with a discussion of the draft Five-Year Plan. Wang Pingyang, Director of the Engineering Department of the General Company, reported on the planning principles and key points of the Five-Year Plan. He pointed out that the plan was formulated based on the following main conditions: (1) To cooperate with increased agricultural production, transportation development, and industrial construction, and to strive to develop resources based on possible conditions, in order to establish a foundation for heavy industry. (2) To establish central power plants in locations suitable for economical power generation, to concentrate power generation as much as possible, to lay high-voltage transmission lines, to connect various power plants and power consumption centers, and to establish a power grid to achieve low costs and universal power supply areas. (3) Thermal power plants should be located near coal mining areas to save transportation tools and transportation labor, in order to fully utilize national resources. (4) The construction of hydroelectric power plants should take into account the interests of irrigation, shipping, and flood control. (5) To extend rural lines as much as possible within the economically feasible range, to supply farmland irrigation and other agricultural electricity. In order to cooperate with the industrial development of North China, the first step is to solve the electricity shortage problem in the Beijing-Tianjin-Tangshan-Zhangjiakou power system. This area currently relies on thermal power generation. To solve this problem, preparations must begin now to utilize hydropower. Measurements are already underway on the North Juma River at Zijing Pass. To ensure electricity supply for the Guye aluminum industry, the construction of the Luojiatun hydroelectric power project must be carried out quickly. Before this plan is completed, the transmission line from Beijing to Zijing Pass must be erected. The transmission lines from Tangshan to Guye, Qinhuangdao to Changli, and Guye to Changli must also be connected immediately. In order to cooperate with the overall industrial development (especially steel, aluminum, and Tianjin textile industry), the plan is to generate 200,000 kilowatts within five years, doubling the current capacity. In between the implementation of the above two plans, efforts should be made to add a 25,000-kilowatt thermal power generator. During the meeting discussions, in addition to unanimously agreeing to the above plan, the attendees also passed resolutions for the general and branch companies to separately convene meetings to study the Five-Year Plan, and the North China Enterprise Department also established a research group to study the Five-Year Plan. The second issue discussed at the meeting was the use of existing unused machinery to solve urgent electricity needs. Each branch company and power plant, based on the principle of local obedience to the overall situation, expressed their willingness to dismantle and transport their existing unused machinery for use elsewhere. Other areas such as the Zhengtai railway line (including the Shijiazhuang and Weishui power plants) and Liuhegou are currently focusing on strengthening technology and improving the maintenance of existing machinery for power generation. Regarding the leadership relationship between the general and branch organizations, Comrade Zhang Bin, representative of the General Company, pointed out: The general principle is to move towards greater centralization. The General Company is responsible for the planning and expansion of projects and the determination of policy directions, while the branch companies are responsible for implementation. At the same time, attention should also be paid to the method of centralized management and layered responsibility. As for the relationship between the various departments and sections of the general and branch companies, the handover group will discuss it in detail.
    The meeting adjourned at 3:30 p.m. General Manager Bao Guobao announced that the attendees would be divided into four discussion groups: management, engineering, staff, and business, to conduct detailed discussions according to the nature of each issue.

　　华北电业公司扩大会议
  　讨论五年计划草案
    配合工业发展拟发电二十万千瓦
    【本报讯】华北电业公司扩大会议的第二天（八日），初步讨论五年计划，利用华北区现存未用机器解决急需用电，总、分公司机构及各种关系等方案。会议首先讨论五年计划草案。由总公司工程处处长王平洋报告五年计划的计划原则及计划重点，他指出计划系根据下面几个主要条件制定的：（一）配合农业增产，交通发展，工业建设，根据可能条件尽力开发资源，以树立重工业之基础。（二）在适合发电经济条件地点，设立中央发电所，尽量集中发电，敷设高压输电线路，联络各发电所及用电中心，成立电力网，以求成本低廉及供电区域普遍。（三）火力发电所应靠近煤矿区，节省运输工具及运输劳力，以求国家资源之充分利用。（四）建设水力发电所，应兼顾灌溉、航运及防洪之利益。（五）在经济可能范围内，尽量推广农村线路，以供农田灌溉及其他农业用电。为了配合华北工业发展，首先解决平、津、唐、张电力系统缺电问题。这一区域现在都是火力发电，要解决这一问题就需从现在开始准备利用水力发电。现在已在紫荆关北拒马河上着手测量。为保证古冶铝工业的用电起见，必须迅速进行罗家屯水利发电工程的建设。在此计划未完成前，先要将北平至紫荆关的输电线路架好。唐山至古冶，秦皇岛至昌黎，古冶至昌黎的输电线路，也都要马上连接起来。为了配合整个工业发展（尤其是钢铁、铝、天津纺织业），五年内计划发电二十万千瓦，较现在提高一倍。在执行以上两部计划之间，要设法添设二万五千千瓦的火力发电机一座。在会议讨论中间，除一致同意以上计划外，并通过总、分公司分别召开研究五年计划的会议，华北企业部也设立研究五年计划小组进行研究。大会讨论的第二个问题是利用现存未用机器解决急需用电。各分公司及各发电厂都本着局部服从全局的原则，愿将本厂现有未用机器拆运至别处使用。其他如正太沿线（包括石家庄、微水发电厂）及六河沟等地，目前主要加强技术，改善维护现有机器发电的工作。谈及总、分机构的领导关系问题，总公司代表张彬同志指出：总的原则是更要走向集中。总公司负责工程的计划和扩充以及政策方针的决定，分公司负责执行，同时也要注意集中管理，分层负责的办法。至于总、分公司各处、课之间的关系，移交小组会议详细讨论。
    大会讨论至下午三点半停止。鲍国宝总经理宣布将到会人员划分为管理、工程、职工、业务四个讨论小组按照各个问题的性质分别进行详细讨论。
