A short commentary
The North China Flood Prevention Conference has clearly pointed out that this year's flood prevention tasks are: to ensure agricultural production, transportation lines, and the vast number of residents are not or minimally affected by flooding, to resolutely defend the main embankments of major rivers, and to not allow breaches until the floodwater level is less than five centimeters from the top of the embankment. The embankments of other rivers are also determined to strive to avoid breaches under normal water levels. The task is so clear and arduous that all relevant departments and all the people of North China should immediately be vigilant, rise up, and go all out.

This year, we have carried out extensive repairs to the embankments of various rivers. The quality of the project has exceeded any previous year, but it must be recognized that this year's project is still in the nature of selective hazard rectification, and the embankments of various rivers are still very weak, especially the dilapidated embankments in the newly liberated areas. Therefore, vigorous flood prevention is not to be neglected in the slightest. Any complacency, blind optimism, or attempts to take chances may lead to serious adverse consequences. We believe that flood prevention work must implement the principle of subordinating minor interests to major interests and subordinating the partial to the whole. In the past, the departmentalism of individual regions and individual cadres did increase the difficulty of flood prevention work and expanded the scope of flooding, which deserves high attention. Secondly, it must be clear that flood prevention work is the most important work during the flood season in the riverine areas, and other work must be carried out around flood prevention work. Last year, when the Zhuolong River in Central Hebei had already overflowed its banks, the main cadres of Gaoyang County were still holding medical meetings and planning for city establishment in the county, resulting in a serious flood disaster. This painful lesson must be remembered.

In order to strengthen organizational leadership, unified and powerful flood prevention institutions should be established in riverine areas, with administrative heads as the main responsible persons, who should personally go to the embankments to supervise and guide at important junctures. Permanent workers should be stationed to guard the embankments, and a rescue team should be organized as a commando force, strengthening discipline, clarifying responsibilities. Those who are negligent and derelict in their duties, resulting in accidents and disasters, must be held accountable for dereliction of duty and given appropriate punishment. Those who are actively responsible and contribute to flood prevention will be rewarded. Now the material conditions are better than in the past. This year, we plan to install radios and telephones at appropriate locations along the rivers to report water conditions in a timely manner and facilitate downstream flood prevention work. Now, the flood season is approaching, and we should seize the time to increase and repair embankments, check the preparation status of materials and equipment, so as not to be caught off guard when the flood arrives. At the same time, we should mobilize the masses to carry out extensive mountain flood prevention work. Using mountain floods to silt up beaches can not only improve the soil and increase yields, but also reduce flood flow and sediment, which is beneficial to downstream flood prevention work. We hereby wish the flood prevention work a complete success.

专栏：短论

    预祝防汛工作成功
    华北防汛会议已明确指出了今年的防汛任务是：保障农业生产、交通运输线路和广大居民不受或少受水害，坚决防守主要河流的主要堤防，在洪水位低于堤顶五公寸前不准决口。其他河流堤防也确定在一般水位下争取不决口。任务是如此明确而艰巨，我华北全区各有关部门和全体人民，应即警惕奋起，全力以赴。
    今年各河堤防我们是进行了大力修补的。在工程质量上超过了以往任何一年，但必须认识：今年的工程还是择险修整的性质，各河堤防还是很薄弱的，新解放地区的堤防尤其残破，因此，大力进行防汛，是丝毫不容忽视的，任何麻痹大意、盲目乐观、企图侥幸，都可能遭到严重的恶果。我们认为：防汛工作必须贯彻小利服从大利，局部服从整体的原则。过去个别地区个别干部的本位主义，的确增加了防汛工作的困难与扩大了水灾的范围，值得提出高度注意。其次必须明确防汛工作是沿河地区伏汛期间的头等重要工作，其他工作要围绕防汛工作去进行。去年冀中潴龙河在大水已经漫堤时，高阳县区主要干部还在县里开医药会议，计划设市等工作，结果酿成严重水灾，此种惨痛教训必须记取。
    为加强组织领导，沿河地区要建立统一有力的防汛机构，行政首长为主要负责人，在重要关节上应亲自上堤督导。应该设置常备工驻堤防守，并组织抢险队作为突击力量，加强纪律性，严明职责，对于麻痹大意疏于防守而出险成灾者，必须追究失职责任，给以适当处分。对积极负责、防汛有功者给以奖励。现在物质条件比过去好了，今年我们在各河适当地点拟装设电台、电话，及时报告水情，便利下游进行防汛工作。现在，大汛快要到了，应该抓紧时间，增修堤防，检查料物、器材的准备状况，以免大汛到来措手不及，同时应发动群众进行广泛的山地防汛工作。利用山洪放淤成滩，不但能改良土壤、增加产量，且可减少洪水流量与泥沙，有益于下游防汛工作。我们在此预祝防汛工作的胜利成功。
