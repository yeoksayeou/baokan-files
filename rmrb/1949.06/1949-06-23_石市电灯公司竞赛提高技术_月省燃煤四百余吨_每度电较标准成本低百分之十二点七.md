    Shijiazhuang Electric Company Improves Technology Through Competition
    Monthly Coal Savings Exceed 400 Tons
    Electricity Cost 12.7% Lower Than Standard

    [Shijiazhuang Dispatch] In the May competition, the Shijiazhuang Electric Company reduced the cost of electricity generation by 12.7% compared to the standard cost stipulated by the Enterprise Department, saving a total of 67,845 catties of millet. Coal savings played a direct role in reducing costs (coal accounts for 41% of the total cost), with a total of 418 tons of coal saved in May. At the start of the May competition, the Engineering Department made reasonable arrangements for the power generation of the five power plants under its jurisdiction. Because the No. 1 Power Plant had older machinery and higher coal consumption, it was designated as a reserve plant, not generating electricity under normal circumstances. When necessary or when other plants were shut down for maintenance, the plant could be fired up within one or two hours to supply power. By shifting the 200,000 kilowatt-hours of power generated by this plant to the No. 3 Plant, a monthly savings of 110 tons of coal was achieved. Each plant made improvements in coal combustion methods, with the No. 3 Plant being the most significant, saving 180 tons of coal throughout the month. Workers in the boiler section of the plant lengthened the drawbars in the No. 1 furnace, thinned the coal in the furnace, made it easier for the wind to blow through, and made the coal easier to burn, which saved coal and strengthened the fire. Subsequently, the ventilation method of the furnace bottom air box was further improved by enlarging the air holes by two times, so as to make the wind flow smoothly and strengthen the fire, and the temperature in the furnace was significantly increased. As a result, the speed of water lifting was strengthened and the amount of coal burned was reduced. When dumping furnace ash, half a furnace was dumped each time, leaving the other half on the furnace bars to keep the unburned coal burning. This doubled the number of times ash was dumped (from six to twelve or thirteen times), but it ensured that the coal was burned completely and less coke was produced. After repeated improvements, the four plants saved a total of 398 tons of coal, and including the No. 1 plant, a total of 418 tons of coal was saved. Secondly, employees actively improved technology and increased work efficiency, which was another factor in reducing costs. For example, the foundry team of the No. 1 Plant's Repair Department cast spray nozzles. In the past, one mold could only cast one nozzle, but after improvement, five molds were connected together in one sand box, so five could be cast at once. Workers at the No. 2 Plant repaired an air compressor that had been destroyed by enemy fire into scrap iron, saving more than 3,000 catties of millet. Other departments of the company contributed to cost reduction. The reasons for these achievements, in addition to the workers actively using the experience of last year's competition and the leadership's appropriate scheduling, were the trial implementation of the "Cost Reduction Reward Measures" approved by the Enterprise Department, which greatly motivated the enthusiasm of employees for production. The method is to use 50% of the cost reduction as a general reward, 15% as an individual reward, 15% to the trade union, and 20% to the public. The purpose is to encourage employees to fully develop their work enthusiasm and creativity to create new production standards. At the same time, the monthly and year-end bonuses were cancelled. The implementation of this single competition award makes the reward more explicit and effective. This method has attracted the attention and discussion of public enterprises in Shijiazhuang.

    石市电灯公司竞赛提高技术
    月省燃煤四百余吨
    每度电较标准成本低百分之十二点七
    【石家庄电】石家庄电灯公司，五月竞赛中，发电每度较企业部规定的标准成本减低百分之十二点七，共节省小米六万七千八百四十五斤。对减低成本起直接作用的是煤的节省（煤占总成本百分之四十一），五月份共省煤四百十八吨。五月竞赛开始，工务处对所规定五个发电厂的发电量作了合理的调度，第一发电厂因机器旧，煤耗率多，乃将该厂作为预备厂，平时不发电，必要时或其他厂停车检修时，该厂在一、二小时内即可起火供电。把该厂发电量二十万度改由三厂带动，每月可省煤一百零十吨。在燃煤方法上各厂都有改进，以三厂最为显著，全月省煤一百八十吨。该厂锅炉股工人加长一号炉内的拉杆子，将炉内的煤摊薄，风容易吹透，煤也容易燃烧，省了煤又加强了火力。其后更进一步改良炉底风箱通风办法，把风眼加大两倍，使风力畅通，火力加强，炉内温度显著升高。因而加强升水速度，减低燃煤量。在落炉灰上每次放半炉，剩下半炉，盖在炉条上，使未烧尽的煤继续燃烧，这样每落炉的次数要多一倍（由六次增到十二、三次），但可以使煤烧尽而少出焦子。经过再三改进后，四个厂共省煤三百九十八吨，连同一厂共省煤四百十八吨。其次，职工们积极改良技术，提高工作效率，也是减低成本的另一因素。如一厂修理部的翻砂股铸喷水嘴子，过去一个模样只能铸一个，经改进后，把五个模样连在一起打一个沙箱，一次可以铸五个。二厂工人修好了一架被敌火毁成废铁的空气压缩机，节省了三千多斤小米。其他该公司各室股在减低成本上都有贡献。获得这些成绩的原因，除了工人积极运用了去年竞赛的经验以及领导上做了适当调度外，经企业部批准的“成本减低奖励办法”的试行，大大激励了职工的生产积极性。该办法是以成本减低数中百分之五十作普遍奖，百分之十五作个别奖，百分之十五交工会，百分之二十交公。目的在鼓励职工高度发挥工作积极性与创造性，以创造新的生产标准。同时取消了月奖和年终奖。实行这个单一的竞赛奖，使奖励作用更为明确，收效亦更为显著。这一办法，已引起石市各公营企业的注意和研讨。
