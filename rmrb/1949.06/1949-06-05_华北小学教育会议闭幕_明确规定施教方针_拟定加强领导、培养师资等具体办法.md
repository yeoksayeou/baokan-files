    [This Newspaper's Dispatch] The North China Elementary Education Conference, which opened in Beiping on May 20th, concluded successfully on June 3rd after half a month of intensive discussion and research. Attendees included: the directors of education departments from Eastern Hebei, Central Hebei, Southern Hebei, Taihang, Taiyue, Hebei-Shandong-Henan, Chahar, and Suiyuan-Mongolia regions, as well as the directors of the education bureaus of Beiping, Tianjin, Taiyuan, and Shijiazhuang, along with section chiefs and principals of complete elementary schools, totaling 58 participants. Representatives from the Propaganda Department of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, the North China Bureau of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, the Publication Committee, North China University, and other organizations and schools attended as observers. Comrade Xu Teli, a veteran educator and member of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, Chairman Dong Biwu, Vice-Chairman Lan Gongwu, and Vice-Chairman Yang Xiufeng of the North China People's Government, Secretary Bo Yibo of the North China Bureau of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, and Propaganda Minister Zhou Yang of the North China Bureau visited the conference to provide guidance and deliver reports, giving detailed instructions on the nature and tasks of elementary education, policies, the material and political treatment of elementary school teachers, the policy on intellectuals, and the unity of new and old cadres. During the conference, in addition to six typical reports presented by various regions on the 28th to exchange work experiences, efforts were concentrated on discussing and studying the "Draft Provisional Implementation Measures for Elementary Education in the North China Region," the "Draft Provisional Regulations for Elementary School Teachers' Service in the North China Region," and the four major issues of educational administrative leadership, funding, teachers, and textbooks. Through repeated discussions in groups and in the general assembly, the presidium gathered everyone's opinions, organized, revised, and supplemented them. Finally, Minister Chao Zhefu of the Ministry of Education delivered a concluding report. The conference then came to a successful conclusion. The formulated measures and suggestions will be submitted to the North China People's Government for approval and will be promulgated for implementation throughout the region.
    The conference, based on the new situation of the complete liberation of the North China region and the beginning of a period of peaceful construction, and the imminent victory of the entire country, called for raising elementary education a step further from its current foundation. Therefore, the conference clearly defined the implementation guidelines for elementary education, formulated relatively unified measures and systems, and appropriately addressed how to strengthen educational administrative leadership, improve the quality of elementary school teachers, appropriately improve the economic treatment and political status of elementary school teachers, and address specific issues such as funding and textbooks, in order to achieve the gradual and planned development and popularization of elementary education. The conference particularly emphasized solving the problem of enrollment for children of urban workers and poor children. The resolution of these issues will enable elementary education in the North China region to adapt to the urgent needs of economic construction and usher in an epoch-making development.
    Regarding the issue of implementation guidelines, discussions at the conference were the most enthusiastic. After repeated research and discussion, it was determined that the educational objective of elementary education is to cultivate citizens with basic cultural knowledge and skills, healthy bodies and minds, a love of labor, and love for the people and the country. The most important thing is to learn culture.
    Based on the above educational objectives, the principles and methods for the school system, curriculum, teaching arrangements, and leadership were determined. In terms of the school system, it was stipulated that it would remain a four-two system. In order to take care of production and facilitate the enrollment of poor workers' and peasants' children, in addition to full-day elementary schools, primary elementary schools may adopt a two-part system, half-day system, mobile elementary schools, seasonal elementary schools, and comprehensive village schools. In addition, appropriate regulations were made for extracurricular activities and social activity time. In teaching work, it is advocated to connect with reality, inspire children to think freely about problems, consciously abide by discipline, and implement democratic management methods of collective mutual assistance.
    In the provisional regulations for elementary school teachers' service, the duties of elementary school teachers were clearly defined. The basic task is to complete the education plan on schedule in accordance with the provisions of the "Provisional Implementation Measures for Elementary Education." Secondly, to assist in carrying out social education and pay attention to close contact with the masses. In terms of qualifications, it is stipulated that having a considerable cultural and political level and working ability, being physically healthy, free from serious infectious diseases, and willing to serve the educational construction of the New Democratic state are essential conditions. In addition, specific regulations were made for appointment and dismissal, transfer, treatment, study and further education, and performance appraisal, rewards, and punishments.
    Regarding the question of how to improve and popularize elementary education on the existing foundation, the conference believes that in terms of improvement: in the old liberated areas, the elementary schools that were reorganized last autumn should be inspected, the good ones should be commended, and the deviations should be corrected, and the reorganization should continue to gradually move towards standardization. In the newly liberated areas, the political consciousness of teachers should be raised, the mass viewpoint should be strengthened, the idea of serving the people should be established, and teachers must be fully responsible for children, and teaching work should be improved. For children in newly liberated cities, attention should be paid to labor education. Regarding popularization: various methods must be used to organize children who cannot attend school regularly or full-time to learn. And under the principle of accepting government leadership, implementing the New Democratic education policy and curriculum, private individuals or legal entities who are enthusiastic about education are welcome to donate funds to establish schools.
    The conference also conducted in-depth research on strengthening the leadership of education work, improving and cultivating teachers, funding issues, and the printing and distribution of textbooks, and put forward specific solutions.

　　华北小学教育会议闭幕
  　明确规定施教方针
  　拟定加强领导、培养师资等具体办法
    【本报讯】华北小学教育会议自五月二十日于北平开幕后，经过半个月的紧张讨论研究，已于六月三日闭幕。大会出席者有：冀东、冀中、冀南、太行、太岳、冀鲁豫、察哈尔、绥蒙等区教育处处长及北平、天津、太原、石家庄教育局长，以及科长、完小校长等，共计五十八人，并有中共中央宣传部、中共中央华北局、出版委员会、华北大学等机关学校来宾列席参加。中共中央委员老教育家徐特立同志、华北人民政府董必武主席、蓝公武副主席、杨秀峰副主席、中共中央华北局书记薄一波同志、华北局宣传部长周扬同志，都赴会指导或作报告，对小学教育的性质和任务、方针，小学教师的物质与政治待遇，知识分子政策，新老干部团结问题等，作了详细指示。会议过程中除二十八日由各地区作了六个典型报告，借以交流工作经验外，余均集中力量，讨论研究“华北区小学教育暂行实施办法草案”，“华北区小学教师服务暂行规程草案”，以及教育行政领导、经费、师资、课本四大问题。经小组与大会的反复讨论，由主席团集中大家意见，加以整理修改补充，最后由教育部晁哲甫部长作总结报告。至此，大会乃告圆满结束。所拟定的办法与建议，将提请华北人民政府批准，公布全区执行。
    会议根据华北区全部解放，开始进入和平建设时期，全国胜利即将到来的新形势，要求把小学教育从现有基础上提高一步。因此大会明确规定了小学教育实施方针，制定了比较统一的办法与制度，并适当解决了如何加强教育行政领导，提高小学师资质量，适当改善小学教师的经济待遇与政治地位，以及经费、课本等具体问题，以达到小学教育有步骤的有计划的发展与普及。会上特别强调了解决城市工人子女和贫苦子女的入学问题。这些问题的解决，将使今后华北区小学教育，适应经济建设的迫切要求，有个划时期的开展。
    关于实施方针问题，会议上讨论最为热烈，经反复研究讨论，确定小学教育的施教目标是培养有基本文化知能，身心健康，爱好劳动，爱护人民国家的公民。而最主要的是学习文化。
    根据上述施教目标，确定了学制、课程、教导设置、领导等原则与办法。在学制方面，规定仍为四二制。为了照顾生产，便利贫苦工农子女入学，除整日制小学外，初级小学得采取二部制、半日制、巡回小学、季节性小学、一揽子村学。此外，对课外活动及社会活动时间亦作适当规定。在教导工作上提倡联系实际，启发儿童自由思考问题，自动自觉遵守纪律，实行集体互助的民主管理方法。
    在小学教师服务暂行规程中，明确规定了小学教师的职责，基本任务是根据“小学教育暂行实施办法”的规定，按期完成教育计划。其次是协助开展社会教育，注意与群众密切联系。在资格中，规定具有相当的文化、政治水平与工作能力，身体健康，无严重传染病，并愿为新民主主义国家教育建设服务为必备的条件。此外对任免、调动、待遇、学习进修、考绩奖惩，都作了具体规定。
    关于如何使小学教育在现有基础上提高与普及的问题，大会认为在提高方面：在老区应检查去秋已整顿过的小学，好的表扬，偏的纠正，并继续整顿，逐渐走向正规化。在新区应提高教师政治觉悟，加强群众观点，树立为人民服务的思想，必须对儿童全面负责，并改善教导工作。对新解放城市儿童，应注重劳动教育。关于普及方面：必须用各种办法，组织不能经常或不能整日到校的儿童学习。并在接受政府领导，执行新民主主义教育方针、课程的原则下，欢迎热心教育事业的私人或法团，捐资兴学。
    大会对加强教育工作的领导、提高与培养师资、经费问题、课本的印刷发行等问题，亦均作深入研究，提出了解决的具体办法。
