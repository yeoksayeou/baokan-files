　　Yesterday's Grain Prices Continued to Fall
　　Sales of Gauze and Sundries Also Declined
　　[Ping City News] Food prices generally declined. The market opened steadily, then immediately declined until closing. The reason is that Northeast miscellaneous grains and coarse and fine grains along the Pingjin and Pinghan lines have been successively transported to Ping, increasing the market supply. Trading companies also lowered their quoted prices. Because of the stable and falling grain prices, local residents are mostly not buying grain for storage, and retail sales in general rice shops have decreased, so market transactions are sluggish.
　　Due to the liberation of Qingdao, the general sentiment of cloth merchants hoarding gauze has declined, so the closing price today was flat and weak.
　　Because grain and gauze prices have continuously fallen, most merchants are taking a wait-and-see attitude, and there are not many transactions in the sundries market.

　　昨日粮价续落
  　纱布杂货成交亦少
    【平市讯】食粮普遍下落，开盘平稳，即行下落，直至收盘。原因系东北杂粮及平津、平汉沿线粗细粮相继运平，市场上市量增多，贸易公司牌价亦降低。本市市民亦因粮食稳落，多不购粮存放，一般米粮店门市减少，故市场成交冷落。
    纱布因青岛解放，一般囤积布商购买心气低落，故本日收盘价呈平疲状态。
    杂货因粮食纱布连续下落，故一般商人多持观望，市场成交不多。
