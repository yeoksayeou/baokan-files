Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 28th: Shang Lei, Gao Guangzuo, and 73 other officers and soldiers from the former Kuomintang warship "Lingfu" recently issued a declaration, the full text of which is as follows:

　　Compatriots, colleagues in the Kuomintang Navy:

　　We are a group who have broken free from the shackles of the dark society. Today, after escaping those shackles, we look towards the light, filled with joy.

　　The vast majority of us seventy-three maritime comrades, along with the comrades on the "Chongqing" warship who revolted not long ago, were trained in England. In August of the 37th year of the Republic of China (1948), we sailed the "Chongqing" and "Lingfu" warships back to China. After returning to our country, we saw that our motherland was a semi-feudal and semi-colonial nation. Kuomintang reactionaries, for their own selfish interests, did not hesitate to sell out the entire China to American imperialism. After we generally awakened, none of us were willing to be tools for the dictatorial and traitorous Chiang Kai-shek and his relatives, state officials, wealthy families and running dogs in a civil war against the entire Chinese people. Therefore, some who were passive successively left the navy. Some who were active secretly organized on the two ships, preparing to revolt and join the People's Liberation Army, to establish an independent, democratic, free, prosperous, and strong New China under the leadership of the Communist Party.

　　After the "Chongqing" uprising, the "Lingfu" was put under surveillance, and the shameless Chiang government requested British imperialist warships to escort us to Guangzhou, where we lived a period of depressing life. Last month, Yang Yuanzhong, the commander of the puppet navy's Fourth Military Region, came to inspect the ship. We originally wanted to take the opportunity to revolt, but unfortunately, when sailing to Hong Kong, the British imperialists detained the ship and took it back on the 27th of last month (the ship was given to the Kuomintang reactionary government by Britain under the guise of "lease"). Under these circumstances, we were unable to work, and the reactionary government might arrest us. Therefore, we secretly came to the liberated area by sea. From now on, we are willing to make our greatest efforts to serve the people's navy, eliminate the remaining forces of the Kuomintang reactionaries, and defend our national defense.

　　After arriving in the liberated area, we received warm hospitality and welcome, which moved many of us to tears, because we deeply felt such people's feelings for the first time in our lives!

　　Colleagues in the Kuomintang Navy! Don't hesitate any longer, don't be cannon fodder for the Kuomintang reactionaries led by the four major families. The doomsday of the reactionaries has arrived, and the day of complete liberation of the country is not far away. Please make up your minds quickly, bravely stand on the side of the people! Organize yourselves spontaneously, launch an uprising like the comrades of the "Chongqing," and join the People's Liberation Army to participate in the construction of the New China Navy! The people will welcome you as they welcomed us.

　　Naval officers and soldiers of the former Kuomintang warship "Lingfu": Shang Lei, Gao Guangzuo, Zhang Bingkui, Cao Zhuyan, Chen Qichuan, Zhang Bingzhong, Liu Yuzhu, Gao Chongtian, Ma Guangzhen, Zhang Guangjun, Chen Nengrong, Song ShaoCheng, Xu Tianpei, Xu Mingzheng, Huang Jie, Zhao Boxiang, Zhao Songyang, Li Bingzheng, Bai Ming, Bao Huixiang, Wu Hanguang, Yu Shizhen, Wang Zhewei, Shu Qimo, Huang Zhengxin, Chen Shuangbin, Jiang Wenbing, Cui Zhihong, Wang Chengxun, Gan Zhenghua, Fang Zhiyi, Lian Tongzheng, Li Shoubing, Chen Gongdun, Xia Tao, Gao Bingqi, Zheng Hongguo, Wu Hongshan, Pei Bojun, Xiong Jun'an, Tian Jingbo, Le Lixin, Yang Gang, Tao Xingjian, Kong Shouyi, Ji Shuwen, Pei Juesan, Tu Yinhua, Peng Zhiqing, Xie Feipeng, Zhao Jiateng, Liao Jingsheng, Kuang Limu, Ge Hongda, Feng Guanglin, Huang Xinghao, Wen Guoguang, Jing Lixing, Ye Lang, Jin Beilang, Wu Jiaqi, Hu Jinbao, Zhang Zongqian, Li Shiyi, Lü Zhongyun, Liu Beihua, Ma Tingzi, Wu Bosen, Huang Minghai, Zhuang Wanzhong, Zhang Po, Cui Huafeng, Ma Zhongxin.

　　宣言
    【新华社沈阳二十八日电】到达解放区的前国民党军舰“灵甫号”官兵尚镭、高光祚等七十三人日前发表宣言一件，全文如下：同胞们，国民党海军中的同事们：
    我们是从黑暗社会里挣脱枷锁走出来的一群，今天我们在摆脱枷锁之后望着光明，满怀愉快。
    我们七十三个海上同志绝大多数是和不久以前起义的“重庆号”军舰上的同志一起，曾在英国受训的。民国三十七年八月，我们驾着“重庆号”、“灵甫号”两舰返国。回国以后，我们看到我们的祖国是一个半封建半殖民地的国家。国民党反动分子为了自己的私利，不惜出卖整个中国给美帝国主义。我们普遍觉醒之后，都不愿再为独裁卖国的蒋介石及其皇亲国舅豪门走狗们做反对全中国人民的内战的工具。于是，一部分消极的便相继脱离了海军。一部分积极的便在两舰秘密的组织起来，准备起义，参加人民解放军，在共产党领导之下，建立独立、民主、自由、富强的新中国。
    “重庆号”起义之后，“灵甫号”即被监视，并且由无耻的蒋政府请英帝国主义军舰押解我们到广州去，在那里过了一段沉闷的生活。上月伪海军第四军区司令杨元忠乘该舰来巡，我们本欲乘机起义，不幸方航至香港时，英帝国主义即将该舰扣押，并于上月二十七日将该舰收回（该舰是英国用“租借”的名义送给国民党反动政府的）。在此种环境之下，我们工作无法进行，而且反动政府可能将我们逮捕起来，于是我们便由海路秘密的来到解放区。我们今后愿以最大的努力，为人民海军服务，肃清国民党反动分子的残余势力，保卫我国的海防。
    到达解放区后，我们受到热诚的招待和欢迎，使我们不少人被感动得流泪，因为深受这种人民的感情，在我们还是生平的第一次！
    国民党海军中的同事们！不要再犹豫了，不要再做以四大家族为首的国民党反动派残余的炮灰了。反动派的末日已经到来，全国完全解放的日子不远了。请你们快下决心，勇敢的站到人民方面来吧！自动的组织起来，象“重庆号”的同志们那样举行起义，参加到人民解放军方面来，参加新中国海军的建设吧！人民将如欢迎我们一样的来欢迎你们。
    前国民党军舰“灵甫号”海军官兵尚镭、高光祚、张炳奎、曹助雁、陈淇川、张炳中、刘裕铸、高冲天、马光祯、张光钧、陈能荣、宋绍成、徐天培、徐明铮、黄杰、赵伯祥、赵松阳、李秉正、柏铭、包惠祥、吴汉光、虞世珍、王哲伟、舒起谟、黄正信、陈双斌、江文炳、崔志宏、王成勋、甘正华、方志毅、炼同铮、李守炳、陈公惇、夏涛、高炳琪、郑洪国、吴鸿山、裴伯军、熊俊安、田镜伯、乐礼鑫、杨刚、陶行健、孔守义、季书文、裴爵三、凃荫华、彭治卿、谢飞鹏、赵家腾、廖景圣、况礼穆、葛洪达、冯广林、黄星浩、文国光、敬力行、叶琅、金北琅、吴家祺、胡金宝、张宗前、李世义、吕仲耘、刘悲华、马廷梓、吴伯森、黄明海、庄万钟、张坡、崔华峰、马中心。　　　六月二十日
