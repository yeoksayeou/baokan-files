Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 27th: TASS Paris dispatch: The Politburo of the French Communist Party held a meeting on the 24th, chaired by General Secretary Thorez. The meeting issued a communiqué stating: The Politburo of the Communist Party declares that the democratic counter-demonstration on June 18th (referring to the people's demonstration against de Gaulle's rebellious demonstration), the strike of civil servants, the resistance of workers in the National Aircraft Manufacturing Federation, the merchants' protest against extra taxes, the farmers' united efforts to prevent the forced confiscation of produce, and the veterans' preparations for demonstrations, etc., prove the recent increase in the fighting spirit of the working people.

All working people, union members or non-union members, should unite against the government's policy of poverty, unemployment, and high taxes. All republicans should unite to stop de Gaulle's rebellion, whose criminal actions are encouraged by government policies.

The policy of selling war leads the people to poverty. The unity of the broad masses is a sure guarantee of victoriously resisting this policy. The Politburo pays tribute to the unity of the broad masses.

The Politburo calls on the working people, republicans, and all who support peace to be vigilant, strengthen unity, and defend their right to life, freedom, and peace.

The Politburo emphasized that the mass movement in response to the threat of depriving Thorez of his parliamentary privilege is only just beginning. This movement has already forced the National Assembly to reject the demand to deprive Thorez of his parliamentary privilege. Socialist Mesic received the support of fascist Motte when attacking Thorez, which proves that the Socialist leaders have played a vanguard role in suppressing labor policies.

The Politburo expressed its deep conviction that the Socialist workers will condemn this policy and called on Party members to do their best to unite with the Socialist workers they work with in order to repel all attacks by the enemy of the people.

The Politburo decided to convene a meeting of the Central Committee of the Communist Party on July 1st and 2nd.

　　法共政治局发表公报
  　号召人民加强团结
    保卫生活权利、自由与和平
    【新华社北平二十七日电】塔斯社巴黎讯：法国共产党政治局二十四日举行会议，由总书记多列士任主席，会议发表公报称：共产党政治局声明，六月十八日民主反示威（按指人民示威反对戴高乐的叛乱示威），公务员的罢工，全国飞机制造联合会工人的反抗，商人对额外税收的抗议，农民团结一致阻止用武力没收生产品，以及退伍军人准备示威等群众运动，证明了最近劳动人民斗争情绪的增涨。
    一切劳动人民、工会会员或非工会会员，都联合起来反对政府所奉行的贫穷、失业、和高额税收的政策。一切共和分子都联合起来制止戴高乐的叛乱，他的罪恶行动是得到政府政策的鼓励的。
    贩卖战争的政策把人民导向贫困，广大群众的团结一致，是胜利地反抗这一政策的确定的保证，政治局特向广大群众的团结致敬。
    政治局号召劳动人民、共和分子以及一切拥护和平的人提高警觉，加强团结，保卫他们的生活权利、自由与和平。
    政治局着重指出，回答剥夺多列士议员特权之威胁的群众运动还只在开始，这一运动已迫使国民议会否决了剥夺多列士议员特权的要求。社会党人梅席在攻击多列士时，得到法西斯分子摩特的支持，这证明社会党领袖们在镇压劳工政策中已起着先锋作用。
    政治局表示深信社会党的工人们将谴责这种政策，并号召党员尽力与一同工作的社会党工人们团结一起，以击退人民之敌的一切进攻。
    政治局决定于七月一日及二日召开共产党中央委员会会议。
