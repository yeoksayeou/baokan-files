Those Who Harm the People Must Be Punished
　　Two More Bandits Captured
　　[Our Newspaper] The bandit Dang Shaozong, who committed twelve robberies in Beiping, has been captured. Bandit Dang served as the deputy squad leader of the Kuomintang puppet Ji County Security Team, exploiting the people and was long hated by them. Before the liberation of Beiping, Bandit Dang colluded with bandits Zhou Er, Bian Zexiang, and others to commit five robberies outside Chaoyangmen, but the reactionary Kuomintang security agencies never intervened. After liberation, Bandit Dang continued to be an enemy of the people, committing seven robberies inside Chaoyangmen, Tianqiao Xiaoshi, and other places, robbing residents, merchants, and pedestrians of gold rings, silver dollars, People's Banknotes, bicycles, cloth, clothing, and other items. The people hated him to the bone. On April 26, this bandit was finally captured at the home of Meng, No. 2 Zhaoziying, and a Type 94 pistol, six bullets, and multiple pieces of stolen goods were seized. The stolen goods have been identified and returned to their original owners. Bandit Dang confessed to the criminal acts of robbery. Accomplice Bian Zexiang was also captured by the Fourth Outer Branch Bureau of the Public Security Bureau on April 27. The two arrested bandits have been transferred to the People's Court for severe punishment according to the law. (Trace)
