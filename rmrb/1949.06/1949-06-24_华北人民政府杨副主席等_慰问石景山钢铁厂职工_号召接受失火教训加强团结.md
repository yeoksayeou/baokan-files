    Huaibei People's Government Vice Chairman Yang and Others
    Visit Shijingshan Steel Plant Workers
    Calling for Learning from Fire Lessons and Strengthening Unity
    [Special report from this newspaper] Yang Xiufeng, Vice Chairman of the Huaibei People's Government, Liu Ding, Deputy Minister of Public Enterprises, and Xiao Ming, Director of the Preparatory Committee of the Beiping Municipal Federation of Trade Unions, went to the Shijingshan Steel Plant on June 22nd to convene a meeting of more than 400 staff and workers. They explained the circular issued by the Huaibei People's Government on June 16th regarding the fire in the plant's laboratory. At the same time, they expressed their sympathy to the staff and workers who had actively engaged in production since liberation and who had made meritorious contributions to the fire rescue. Vice Chairman Yang spoke first at the meeting. He said: "The Huaibei People's Government values the active spirit of all staff and workers of the Shijingshan Steel Plant since liberation. The fire was only caused by a very small number of employees lacking a sense of responsibility." He cited many moving stories of the plant's employees actively engaged in production. Secondly, he spoke about the significance of issuing this circular, which is: we must cherish the people's property and the achievements of all working staff, avoid losses due to the negligence and slackness of a few people, and further enhance our sense of responsibility in our work. When he talked about the purpose of the punishment, he said: "Our punishment is to educate everyone, not simply to penalize. Therefore, everyone should have a spirit of responsibility for their work and become more active." Finally, he called on all employees to strengthen unity, further enhance the enthusiasm and labor zeal that has been heightened since the fire, pay attention to waste in production, and use the money saved for production in order to expand our production.
  Xiao Ming Calls on People to Go Among the Workers
    When Xiao Ming, Director of the Preparatory Committee of the Beiping Municipal Federation of Trade Unions, spoke, he particularly emphasized the importance of unity between the factory's administration, the Party, and the trade union. He said: "The leaders of the factory's administration and trade union are not democratic enough. If the factory management does not adopt democratic management methods, then the factory has no soul, and the most important content of carrying out the democratic movement is to carry out self-criticism and criticism." He explained what would happen if there was only criticism without self-criticism. He said: "The staff and workers will say: 'We are the masters of our own house, but we can't make decisions.' The administration will say: 'Because the workers are not managed.' If the trade union work is not done well, the trade union comrades will say to the members: 'It's all because none of you care.' The members will say: 'You were good in the past, but after we elected you, you didn't listen to anyone's voice.' Therefore, only by carrying out self-criticism can we avoid antagonism." He also explained the correct meaning of democratic centralism in simple terms. He asked the comrades working in the trade union to go among the workers, not just sit in the office, and let all the workers do the trade union work.
  Deputy Minister Liu Makes Self-Criticism
    When Liu Ding, Deputy Minister of Public Enterprises of the Huaibei People's Government, spoke, he first made a self-criticism. He pointed out that the work of rectifying the steel plant was too slow and that there was not enough specific help for the factory at ordinary times. The Department of Public Enterprises should also be responsible for the fire. He hoped that the staff and workers would strengthen unity and strive to build the people's steel industry. The meeting ended here. According to the circular issued by the Huaibei People's Government regarding the fire in the steel plant's laboratory, the plant had held cadre meetings, trade union committee meetings, and meetings of activists for several days to convey and discuss it. All staff and workers believed that the government's handling of the matter was fair and reasonable. Xue Peng, a worker from the electrical repair room, said: "If it were the Kuomintang, Zhao Jinji (the handyman who looked after the laboratory) would have been sent to the 208th Division or the military police, and Jin Huai, (the head of the laboratory and the person directly responsible for the fire) would have gotten away with a personal favor at most." Another worker said: "In the past, we thought that cadres would not be punished for making mistakes, but now it seems that they are punished very severely, which is really different from the past." The people who were punished also sincerely expressed their acceptance of the punishment from the government and the military control committee. For example, Comrade Chen Lei, the military representative, said: "The punishment makes me more aware of the shortcomings in my work, and I will compensate for the people's losses with a more tenacious spirit." Factory Director An Chaojun said: "I don't think the punishment is a blow to me. I should be more responsible in the future. It is wrong to be afraid of taking responsibility."
  Staff and Workers Work Together to Rebuild the Laboratory
    The fire was a warning sign for the work of the Shijingshan Steel Plant. It also inspired all staff and workers to work more enthusiastically. When rebuilding the laboratory, the staff and workers added one hour of work after get off work every day and volunteered to participate. In three days, 670 people cleaned up the eleven burned-down fire sites completely. The new three laboratories were originally planned to take four weeks and 960 man-days, but they were completed in only two weeks and 605 man-days. The arrival of the responsible comrades from the Huaibei People's Government and the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions gave great encouragement to all the staff and workers of the Shijingshan Steel Plant. A worker told the reporter: "Vice Chairman Yang has come to see us, we should work harder."

    华北人民政府杨副主席等
    慰问石景山钢铁厂职工
    号召接受失火教训加强团结
    【本报专访】华北人民政府副主席杨秀峰、公营企业部副部长刘鼎、北平市职工总会筹委会主任萧明，于六月二十二日同赴石景山钢铁厂召集职员工人四百余人，举行会议，解释六月十六日华北人民政府为该厂化验室失火案颁布之通令，同时慰问解放以来积极生产，并此次失火抢救有功的职员及工人。会议首由杨副主席讲话，他说：“华北人民政府对于解放以来石景山钢铁厂全体职工的积极精神是重视的，造成失火事件，只是极少数职工的责任心不够。”他列举了许多该厂职工们积极生产的动人事迹。其次他说到颁布这一个通令的意义，是在于：我们要宝贵人民的财产和全体劳动职工的成果，避免因为少数人的疏忽懈怠而遭受损失，并愈加提高我们工作的责任心。他谈到处分的目的时说：“我们处分是为了教育大家，决不是简单为了惩办，因此，大家应有对工作负责的精神，愈加积极起来。”最后他号召全体职工加强团结，把失火以后提高的积极性和劳动热情再提高一步，注意生产上的浪费，将节约出来的钱用到生产上去，求得扩大我们的生产。
  萧明号召到工人中去
    北平市职工总会筹委会主任萧明讲话时，他特别强调工厂的行政、党、和工会之间团结的重要。他说：“现在厂里行政的工会的负责人还不够民主，工厂管理若不采取民主管理的方式，那工厂就没有灵魂了，而开展民主运动最重要的内容，就是进行自我批评和批评。”他解释如果只有批评而没有自我批评，结果会怎样呢？他说：“职工们会说：‘我们当家作不了主。’行政上会说：‘由于工人不受管理。’工会工作没有做好，工会的同志会对会员们说：‘全是你们大家谁也不管。’会员们则会说：‘过去你们还好，但选举你们出来后，就谁的呼声也不听了。’因此，只有进行自我批评，才能避免对立。”他并通俗的解释了民主集中制的正确意义，他要求工会工作的同志到工人中去，不要只坐在办公室里，要让全体工人来做工会工作。
  刘副部长作自我批评
    华北人民政府公营企业部刘鼎副部长讲话时，首先作了自我批评，他指出对于钢铁厂的整顿工作，做得太慢，对工厂平时具体帮助不够，此次失火事件发生，公营企业部也应负责。他希望职工加强团结，为建设人民的钢铁工业而努力。会议至此就告结束。按华北人民政府关于钢铁厂化验室失火案颁布通令后，该厂曾连日举行干部会议、工会委员与积极分子会议，进行传达和讨论，全体职工对于政府关于此事之处理结果，认为是公平合理的。电气修理房工友薛鹏说：“换着国民党的时候，赵晋基（即看化验室之小工）不是送二○八师就是送宪兵队了，晋怀曾（即化验室主管，失火之直接负责人）最多说个人情也就完了。”另一个工人说：“过去以为干部犯错误不处罚，现在看是处罚得很重，就真是和过去不一样。”被处分的人员也诚恳表示接受政府和军管会的处分，如军事代表陈雷同志说：“处分更使我认清自己工作中的缺点，我将以更顽强的精神来补偿人民的损失。”安朝俊厂长说：“我不认为处分对我是一个打击，以后我应该更负责任，害怕负责是不对的。”
  职工协力重建化验室
    失火事件对于石景山钢铁厂的工作是一个警号，它同时也激发全体职工更热情的工作，在重建化验室时，职工们以每天下班后增加一小时的工作，纷纷自动报名参加，三天功夫六百七十人将十一间烧毁的火场清理得干干净净。新筑三间化验室原计划需时四星期用工九百六十个，结果只用两星期六百零五个工就完成了。此次华北人民政府及市总工会负责同志来到石景山钢铁厂，更予全厂职工极大鼓舞。一个工人对记者说：“杨副主席来看我们了，我们应更努力的工作。”
