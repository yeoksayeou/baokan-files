　　Primary Education in North China Increasingly Standardized
  　Over Three Million Children Enrolled
    [By Our Newspaper] Under the guidance of the general policy of New Democratic education, significant achievements have been made in the development of primary education in North China. There are now 51,593 primary schools (both junior and senior), 76,667 teachers, and over 3,250,000 primary school students (the total number of school-age children is 6,305,044, excluding figures from Taiyuan).
    The vast number of primary school teachers and students, during the War of Resistance Against Japan and the People's Liberation War, bravely and resourcefully used various methods to persist in their teaching work. In central Hebei, after the "May 1st" Great Mopping-Up in 1942, when enemy blockhouses were scattered everywhere, many anti-Japanese primary schools appeared in the blockhouse villages. When the enemy set up a stronghold in Dongcui Village, Anguo County, the village teacher, Lao Li, moved the primary school outside the village. Under the teacher's signals, the students, from the tall crops, carrying grass baskets and manure baskets, holding hoes and sickles, came out to assemble for class. The classrooms were not fixed, sometimes in the graveyard, sometimes in the woods, sometimes during the day, sometimes at night, persisting in carrying out anti-Japanese education. Clever primary school students even went to educate the puppet soldiers: "People fighting their own people, it's really unconscionable!" Some puppet soldiers were very moved and changed their attitude towards the masses. Ma Hanchen, the principal of the 20th Senior Primary School in Ding County, led the secret school against the enemy from sixty people to two hundred and fifteen people. During the enemy's cruel mopping-up operations, students of the 20th Senior Primary School rescued a total of more than 240 cadres. During the People's Liberation War, on the battlefield of Hebei-Shandong-Henan, in order to support the front lines, local village teachers participated in leading stretcher teams to the front to transport the wounded, while primary school students took care of the wounded soldiers. In the seesaw battles south of the Yellow River, children braved the rain and rushed out of the enemy's blockade to send dry food to the wounded soldiers. Li Yongxiang, a child from Qingfeng, sacrificed his life to answer the enemy when the enemy forced him to reveal information. In the case of a lack of labor in the countryside, during the busy farming season, a teaching system and method combining education with production was created. For example, during the weeding season, the Zhou Longhua Primary School in central Hebei not only completed their study plan, but also promoted the masses to get up early.
    Due to the victory of the nationwide counter-offensive in the People's Liberation War and the basic completion of land reform in the old and semi-old areas, the broad masses of people have gained political and economic liberation and universally demand higher cultural standards. Therefore, the leadership in various areas has successively carried out the work of restoring and reorganizing primary education. After the education conference in September last year put forward the policy of regular education focusing on cultural education, it attracted even more attention in various places. The Hebei-Central District Party Committee called for running primary education well with a concern for the working people, and various districts conducted surveys of educational cadres, improved administrative leadership institutions, held educational conferences, mobilized intellectuals in rural areas to participate in education work, trained primary school teachers, appropriately improved the treatment of primary school teachers, and stipulated the direction and principles, school system, curriculum, teaching methods, and management system of primary education.
    After this reorganization, the number of primary school students generally increased. Student morale and teaching effectiveness have also increased. By the end of last year, statistics from only 41 counties in central Hebei, the entire Taiyue area, and three special districts in Chahar showed an increase of 1,621 primary schools and 35,000 students compared to before land reform. The number of kindergarten students and boarders also increased. Due to the strengthening of cultural studies and emphasis on classroom teaching, children are studying with extra intensity. In some areas, parents saw the notices of their children's academic achievements and said: The children have become promising! Village cadres are more concerned about primary schools, going to the schools every day to see the students' learning situation and proactively finding utensils and solving difficulties for the schools.
    In primary and secondary schools in the newly liberated cities, due to the correct implementation of the cultural and educational policies in the newly liberated areas, classes were quickly resumed after liberation, and the number of schools increased. There are now 691 public and private primary schools in Beijing and Tianjin, an increase of 19 compared to before liberation. There are now 211,796 primary school students. Primary school teachers are eager to make progress and are intensifying their political studies and striving to improve their professional skills. On the student side, some have launched movements to love the country, love learning, and love labor, using meetings and newspapers to carry out criticism and self-criticism, showing a new atmosphere.

　　华北小学教育日益正规化
  　三百余万儿童入学
    【本报讯】在新民主主义的教育总方针指导下，华北小学教育建设获重大成就。现已有初、高级小学五万一千五百九十三处，教师七万六千六百六十七人，男女小学生三百二十五万余人（学龄儿童共六百三十万五千零四十四人，缺太原数字）。
    广大的小学教师及小学学生们，在抗日战争及人民解放战争中，曾经英勇机智地运用各种方式，坚持教学工作。在冀中，一九四二年“五一”大扫荡以后，敌人的岗楼星罗棋布时，出现了不少岗楼村抗日小学。当敌人在安国县东崔村安下据点的时候，乡村教师老李就将小学搬到村外去，学生们在老师的暗号下，从青纱帐里背上草篮、粪筐、拿着锄头、镰刀钻出来集合上课，课堂是不固定的，或在坟场，或在树林里，有时在白天，有时在夜晚，坚持进行抗日教育。聪明的小学生们并去教育伪军：“自己人打自己人，真他妈的没良心。”有的伪军很受感动，转变了对群众的态度。定县的第二十高小马汉臣校长，领导着对敌秘密的学校由六十人扩大到二百十五人。在敌人的残酷扫荡中，经二十高小学生营救的干部先后共二百四十余人。人民解放战争中，在冀鲁豫大战场上，为了支援前线，当地乡村教师们参加带领担架队到前线去运送伤员，小学生们则看护伤兵。在拉锯战中黄河以南地区，孩子们冒着雨冲出敌人的封锁，给伤兵送干粮，清丰儿童李永祥当敌人威迫他说情报时，就牺牲了他的生命来回答敌人。在农村缺乏劳动力的情况下，当农忙时，创造了与生产结合的教学制度和方法。如冀中周龙华小学在锄苗季节不但完成了他们的学习计划，而且推动了群众早起。
    由于人民解放战争全国反攻的胜利及土地改革在老区半老区已基本上完成，广大人民获得了政治上及经济上的翻身，普遍要求提高文化，各区领导上遂先后进行小学教育的恢复整顿工作。去年九月教育会议提出以文化教育为主的正规教育方针之后，更引起各地注意。冀中区党委号召以对劳动人民关心的态度办好小学教育，各区均进行了调查教育干部、健全行政领导机构、召开教育会议、动员在乡知识分子参加教育工作、训练小学师资、适当的改善小学教师的待遇、规定小学教育的方针与原则、学制、课程、教学、管理制度等。
    经过这次整顿，小学学生数目一般的增加了。学生情绪和教学效果也高了。到去年底，仅冀中四十一个县、太岳全区、察哈尔三专区的统计，较土改前即增加小学一千六百二十一处，学生增加三万五千人，幼稚生和夜宿生也增多了。由于加强文化学习，重视课堂教学，儿童学习格外紧张。有些地区家长看到孩子们学习成绩的通知，说：孩子们长了出息了！村干部更加关心小学，每天到学校里去看学生们的学习情形，主动的给学校里找用具，解决困难。
    在新解放城市的小学和中等学校，由于正确执行了新解放区文教政策，解放后均迅速复课，学校且有增加。北平天津两市现有公私立小学六百九十一处，比解放前增加十九处，现有小学生二十一万一千七百九十六人，小学教师们迫切要求进步，正加紧政治学习，努力研究改进业务。在学生方面有的开展了爱国家、爱学习、爱劳动的运动，利用会议、报纸展开批评与自我批评，呈现出新的气象。
