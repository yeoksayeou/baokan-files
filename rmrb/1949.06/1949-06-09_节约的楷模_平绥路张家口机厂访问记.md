　　A Model of Thrift
    ——A Visit to the Zhangjiakou Machine Factory of the Ping-Sui Railway
    Our Correspondent Li Yi

    On May 23rd, I visited the Zhangjiakou Machine Factory of the Ping-Sui Railway, one of the factories responsible for repairing and manufacturing locomotives, passenger cars, and freight cars.

    The workers of the machine factory warmly welcomed me. By the roaring boilers, under the earth-shaking steam hammers, and beside the dissected locomotives, they told me about their inspiring innovations in economical production.

    The Zhangjiakou Machine Factory, in the face of extreme shortages of steel, iron, timber, and other raw materials, completed enormous production tasks. Relying on their love for the people's liberation cause, the workers, together with their brothers at the Nankou Machine Factory, repaired, manufactured, and supplied sufficient locomotives, passenger cars, and freight cars for the Ping-Sui Railway. They also promptly supplied the east and west sections of the Ping-Sui Railway with large quantities of spikes, fishplates, and splice bars for the rush repair projects, enabling the swift resumption of traffic after the liberation of Beijing and Datong.

    In the electrical room, worker Xu Quan replaced flat yarn-covered wire with copper plates, converting a burnt-out 30-horsepower wound-rotor motor into a squirrel-cage motor. This transformed waste metal into a living force, saving a large amount of flat yarn-covered wire and yellow insulating varnish cloth, which are currently difficult to obtain. In addition, since May, the workers in the electrical room have repaired eleven generators using the original materials from most of the locomotive generators. They consciously practiced "making the most of everything." I entered the blacksmith shop. The pure blue flames were melting piles of long screw braces for bridges. Young workers Cai Shiyi and An Baoyu, with bare arms, rhythmically hammered the red-hot screw braces. Due to the lack of 1 1/4 inch diameter round iron, the workers in the blacksmith shop first used steam hammers to shrink and forge 5/8 inch thick and 3 1/2 inch wide flat iron into something identical to round iron. The difficulties encountered in the production of spikes were even greater. There was absolutely no 5/8 inch square iron for making spikes. All spikes were made by melting and forging scrap iron. The scrap iron pile in the passenger and freight car factory has been searched through by the workers six times. They did not utter any complaints about this extreme shortage of raw materials. They found usable materials from the scrap iron. According to factory statistics, from May 5th to May 23rd, the workers in the blacksmith shop produced a total of 15,200 spikes, using approximately 6,000 *jin* of scrap iron. This is equivalent to saving 532 bars of 5/8 inch square iron, each 18 feet long. From one corner of the blacksmith shop, you could see the great scene of laborers creating and transforming the world.

    In the foundry, the workers have recently been spreading a good story about veteran worker Dai Dewang. Dai Dewang is large in stature, with a ruddy face. Although he is already a 58-year-old worker, his mood has become younger than that of young people since liberation. Not long ago, when he could not obtain 3/10 inch iron rods, he racked his brains to find substitutes for making cores for casting locomotive grate bars. In the toilet south of the foundry, he discovered that the edges of cut-open gasoline barrels could be used as cores. After several studies with his colleagues in the room, he finally succeeded in the experiment, and it was no less effective than the original 3/10 inch iron rods. Following Dai Dewang's method, the workers in the foundry have cut enough edges from waste oil drums for two years. The workers estimate that at least 200 3/10 inch iron rods can be saved. The workers in the foundry said, "With Dai Dewang's spirit of actively researching, there is no difficulty that cannot be overcome!"

    Qi Qingrui, director of the passenger and freight car repair shop, is a veteran engineer who has served the railway for many years. In the red May, he led the workers to successfully transform an oil filter that had been repeatedly tested during the Japanese occupation but had never succeeded and had been abandoned for five years. He studied that the reason why it could not filter oil was that the steam pipe in the oil cylinder transferred too much heat to the oil and water close to the oil pipe, but it could not apply average and appropriate heat to all the oil and water in the oil cylinder to make it move and separate. He changed to using steam pipes to transfer heat to water, and using water as a medium to transfer heat to oil. This allowed the oil filter to extract more than one-half of pure oil from waste oil. Dozens of barrels of used power oil can still be used after filtration, and the total construction cost of each kilogram of pure oil is only 4.5 percent of the current market purchase price.

    In terms of manpower usage, the workers of the machine factory have also achieved amazing savings. In February, the foundry workers used 379 man-days, using 9,975 *jin* of copper and iron to cast 962 finished products, while during the rule of the Kuomintang bandit gang, at least 500 man-days were required. In the first two weeks of May, when the workers in the electrical repair shop repaired eleven small generators for locomotives, the average manpower used per generator was only half of that during the rule of the Kuomintang bandit gang.

    With the workers' high labor enthusiasm, in the past five months, the Zhangjiakou Machine Factory has repaired more than 30 locomotives and more than 180 passenger and freight cars. In the case of extreme shortage of raw materials and equipment, they have created and are continuing to create amazing feats for the people's railway cause.

　　节约的楷模
    ——平绥路张家口机厂访问记
    本报记者  李翼
    五月二十三日，记者趋访了平绥路机车、客货车的＠姆之一的张家口机厂。
    机厂的职工们，热情地款待了我。在熊熊大火的锅炉房，在震地欲裂的汽锤下，在被剖解了的机车边，他们向我讲述了在节约生产上种种动人的创造。
    张家口机厂，在钢、铁、木材等原料极端困难情况下，完成了巨大的生产任务。职工们凭着对于人民解放事业的热爱，与南口机厂的兄弟们为平绥路，修配和生产了足够的机车客车货车，并及时的供应了平绥路东西两段抢修工程以大量的道钉鱼尾钉和夹板。使着北平和大同解放后，迅速恢复了行车。
    在电气房，工人徐悛以紫铜板代替扁形纱包线，将一部被烧毁了的三十马力卷线型电动机改装为梳笼型电动机。变废铁为活的动力。节省了目前不易买得到的大量扁形纱包线和黄色绝缘漆布。此外，五月以来，电气房的工友们，以原大部机车发电机的材料，修好了十一部发电机。他们自觉的做到了“物尽其用”。我走进打铁房，纯青的炉火，正熔化着成堆的桥梁用长形螺撑，青年工人蔡世义、安宝玉，赤着臂，有节奏的锤击着被烧得通红的螺撑铁。由于一英寸二分直径元铁的缺乏，打铁炉的工友们，就以五分厚三英寸半宽的扁铁，首先以汽锤缩打成与元铁相同的东西。道钉生产所遇到的困难更大，打道钉用的五分方铁，一无所有，一切道钉，均系废铁熔打而成。客货车厂的废铁堆，已被工友们检翻了六次之多，他们没有对这种原料的奇缺发出任何怨言，他们从废铁中找出自己能用的材料。据厂方统计，五月五日至二十三日，打铁房的工友们，共制作道钉一万五千二百个，共用废铁约六千市斤。合计约省用十八英尺长的五分方铁五百三十二条。从打铁房的一角，你可以看出劳动者创造和改造世界的伟大场面。
    在翻砂房，工友们近来传述着老工友戴德旺的一件佳谈，戴德旺身裁硕大，脸红红的。他虽已是五十八岁的老工人，自解放后心情变得比年轻人还年轻。不久以前，当他因为领不到三分铁棍，百般苦思如何找到代用品，制作机车炉条翻砂用骨子，在翻砂房南边的厕所里，他发现被剪开了的汽油桶的边子，可以替做骨子用，他与同房的伙伴们，经过了几番研究，终于试验成功，且较原用之三分铁棍毫无逊色。翻砂房的工友们，依照戴德旺这一办法，已经从废油桶上，剪下了足够二年用的边子，工友们估计，最少可节用三分铁棍二百条，翻砂房的工友们说：“有了戴德旺这种积极钻研精神，没有不可克服的困难！”
    客货车修配所主任齐庆瑞，是一位服务铁路多年的老工程师，在红五月里，他带领工友们胜利的改造了日寇统治时期屡经试验终未成功废置已达五年的滤油器，他研究了不能滤油的原因在于油缸里的汽管过高的传热于紧贴油管的油水，而却不能将油缸中所有的油水施以平均而适当的热度，使之由运动达到分离，他改用蒸汽管传热于水，以水作媒介，传热于油，这样就使着这滤油器能由废油中提炼出二分之一以上的纯油，使几十桶用过了的动力油，过滤后照样可用，而每一公斤纯油全部施工费用，仅为目前在市场上购买价格的百分之四点五。
    在人力使用上，机厂的职工们亦达到惊人的节约。翻砂房工友，在二月份，使用人工三百七十九个，以铜铁九千九百七十五斤，铸成品九百六十二件，而在国民党匪帮统治时期，最少需工五百个。电气修配房工友，在五月上中两旬，修配机车用十一部小型发电机时，每部平均所用人工，仅为国民党匪帮统治时期的一半。
    凭着职工们的高度劳动热忱，在过去五个月里，张家口机厂已修配了三十余辆机车，和一百八十余辆客货车。在原料、器材极端缺乏的情况下，为人民的铁路事业，创造了并且正在继续的创造着惊人事迹。
