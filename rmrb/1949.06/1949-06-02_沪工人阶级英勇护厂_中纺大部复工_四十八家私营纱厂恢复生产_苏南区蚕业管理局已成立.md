　　Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 1st—Textile machinery in Shanghai factories belonging to the China Textile Corporation has now mostly been started. As of the 28th, the yarn and weaving machines started in Cotton Textile Factories No. 1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 10, 14, 15, and 19 have reached more than 60 percent. Among them, all 88,000 yarn spindles and more than 30,000 thread spindles in Factories No. 2 and 15 have been started. Other factories such as wool spinning, ramie, and machinery factories have also started more than 50 percent of their machines. The work of protecting factories by workers in various China Textile Corporation factories began when the People's Liberation Army crossed the Yangtze River and advanced south. Workers in the No. 1 and No. 3 Cotton Textile Factories, as well as wool spinning, ramie weaving, and printing and dyeing factories in the western district of Shanghai, all participated in the factory protection organization. Even in the No. 2, 4, 5, 6, and 11 cotton yarn factories, where the Kuomintang reactionary rule was extremely strict, most of the workers were organized. In early May, the Tang bandit’s Shanghai-Nanjing-Hangzhou Garrison Command ordered the dissolution of all factory protection organizations and sent "liaison officers" to the factories to carry out sabotage activities. However, the workers united with the staff and secretly conducted patrols and guard duties. When the workers discovered that the factory was shipping finished products out of the factory every day, they demanded that the factory store 120,000 bolts of cloth and one month's worth of raw materials. Under pressure from the workers, the factory was forced to agree to store half of the amount. Many workers were arrested while protecting the factories. In the printing and dyeing branch of the No. 3 Cotton Textile Factory alone, 19 people were arrested. Among them, three people gloriously sacrificed their lives due to excessive torture. The security team of more than 80 workers from the No. 1 Wool Spinning Factory first seized the weapons of the factory police when the sound of the People's Liberation Army's guns approached the factory, and then cooperated with the People's Liberation Army to eliminate the remnants of bandits in the World Funeral Home. More than 200 employees of the Wusong Textile Factory No. 8 persuaded five or six hundred bandits who attempted to resist at the factory to lay down their weapons, preserving the factory's assets completely intact when the People's Liberation Army was approaching.

　　Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 1st—Workers and staff of the Shanghai Machinery Factory of the former Kuomintang Resources Committee's Central Machinery Company heroically protected the factory and assisted the People's Liberation Army in maintaining social order. After hearing the news of the liberation of Nanjing, the factory's employees formed a patrol team to patrol the factory day and night. The patrol team consisted of 180 workers and 56 staff members. On the 25th, the workers thwarted the Kuomintang's routed army's attempt to steal a jeep by stealing parts. On the morning of the 27th, as soon as the gunfire in Zhabei subsided, the workers assisted the People's Liberation Army in maintaining social order on Zhoujiazhui Road. They seized two anti-aircraft machine guns, one light machine gun, forty-seven rifles, more than 15,000 rounds of ammunition, grenades, and mortar shells from the routed enemy soldiers and handed them over to the People's Liberation Army. At about 10:00 a.m. on the same day, the worker patrol team dispersed more than 100 thugs who intended to rob the China-Philippines Tobacco Factory and helped the factory's workers form a factory protection team. Thanks to the heroic protection of the employees, all the machines in the Shanghai Machinery Factory were intact. On the 28th, the day after the complete liberation of Shanghai, the workers automatically began to clean the machines in preparation for resuming work. Although the 29th was Sunday, 84 percent of the workers went to the factory to participate in the preparations for resuming work. The Shanghai Machinery Factory is the largest factory specializing in the manufacture of bicycles in Shanghai, and its men's and women's bicycles are sold in Nanjing, Hangzhou, Hankou, Guangzhou, and other places.

　　Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 1st—Forty-eight of the fifty-five private yarn factories in Shanghai have resumed work. Among them, Shenxin No. 9 and No. 2, as well as Xinhuo, Tongyi and other four factories in the western district of Shanghai, have never interrupted production due to the rapid liberation. Only seven factories in Pudong and Wusong districts were damaged by bandits and their power lines were damaged, which are still to be repaired. The above-mentioned fifty-five private yarn factories have a total of more than 1,425,000 yarn spindles, accounting for about one-third of the total number of yarn spindles in the country. They did not suffer any losses in the battle to liberate Shanghai.

　　Xinhua News Agency, Wuxi, 1st—The Southern Jiangsu Sericulture Bureau was established on May 27th by order of the Southern Jiangsu Administrative Office. The pseudo-Jiangsu Provincial Sericulture Improvement Management Committee has been taken over by the Wuxi Military Control Commission and transferred to the Southern Jiangsu Sericulture Bureau. The Sericulture Experiment Station, Sericulture Model Area, and various Sericulture Improvement Areas originally under the committee are still under the leadership of the Southern Jiangsu Sericulture Bureau. The bureau has successively sent personnel to various districts to handle the handover and has begun to manage the cocoon industry and issue cocoon industry business licenses.

  　中纺大部复工
  　四十八家私营纱厂恢复生产
  　苏南区蚕业管理局已成立
    【新华社上海一日电】中纺公司所属上海各厂纺织机器，现已大部开动。截至二十八日止，棉纺织厂第一、二、三、六、七、十、十四、十五、十九等厂开动的纱线织机，已在百分之六十以上。其中第二与第十五两厂的纱锭八万八千余枚、线锭三万余枚已全部开动。其他如毛纺、制麻、机械等厂开动机器也在百分之五十以上。中纺各厂工人的护厂工作，早在解放军渡江南进时即告展开。沪西区的棉纺一厂三厂及毛纺、麻织、印染等厂工人全体参加了护厂组织。即在国民党反动统治极严的棉纱二、四、五、六、十一等厂工人们也大都组织了起来。五月上旬汤匪京沪杭警备司令部下令解散各厂所有护厂组织，并派“连络员”到各厂进行破坏活动。但工人们团结了职员，共同在暗中进行巡查看守。当工人们发觉厂方每天装运成品出厂时，即向厂方提出要厂内经常储存十二万匹布和一个月用的原料。厂方在工人的压力下，被迫答应储存半数。不少工人在进行护厂中被捕。棉纺三厂印染分厂一个厂即被捕十九人。其中有三人因受刑过重而光荣牺牲。毛纺一厂由八十多个工人组成的保安队，在解放军的枪声逼近该厂时，首先缴下厂警的武装，又配合解放军肃清了世界殡仪馆的残匪。吴淞纺织八厂二百多职工，在解放军快到时，劝说企图据厂顽抗的五六百匪军放下武器，保存了全厂资财完整无损。
    【新华社上海一日电】前伪资源委员会中央机器公司上海机器厂工人职员英勇保护工厂，协助人民解放军维持社会秩序。该厂职工在听到南京解放消息后，即组成巡逻队，日夜轮流在工厂周围放哨。巡逻队由一百八十个工人和五十六个职员组成。二十五日，工人们用偷走零件的方法使国民党溃军劫走吉普车的企图归于失败。二十七日清晨，闸北一带的枪声刚停，工人们就在周家咀路协助解放军维持社会秩序。他们由溃逃匪军手中缴获了高射机枪二挺、轻机枪一挺、步枪四十七支、子弹一万五千多发及手榴弹迫击炮弹等，并将其交给解放军。同日上午十时许，工人巡逻队又驱散了意图抢劫华菲烟厂的一百多个歹徒，并帮助该厂工人组成护厂队。由于职工们的英勇保护，上海机器厂所有机器均完好无损。上海全部解放的次日，即二十八日，工人们即自动开始清理机器，准备复工。二十九日虽是星期日，却有百分之八十四的工人进厂参加复工的准备工作。按上海机器厂为上海最大的专造自行车的工厂，所产男女用自行车销行南京、杭州、汉口、广州等地。
    【新华社上海一日电】上海市五十五家私营纱厂已有四十八家复工。其中沪西区的申新第九、第二及信和、统益等四厂，因解放迅速生产从未间断。仅浦东及吴淞地区有七个厂遭匪军破坏，电线受损，尚待修复。上述五十五家私营纱厂共有纱锭一百四十二万五千余枚，约占全国纱锭总数三分之一，在解放上海之战中，均未蒙受损失。
    【新华社无锡一日电】苏南区蚕业管理局已于五月二十七日奉苏南行政公署命令成立。伪江苏省蚕业改进管理委员会，已为无锡军管会接收完毕移交与苏南蚕业管理局，原属该会之蚕丝试验场，蚕桑模范区及各蚕桑改良区，仍归苏南蚕业管理局领导。现该局已先后派员赴各区办理接收移交，并着手进行茧行管理，颁发茧行开业许可证。
