　　Soviet Writers Association Council Twelfth Plenary Session
  　Resolution on Drama and Film
    At the Twelfth Plenary Session of the Council of the Soviet Writers' Union (December 1948), A. Sofronov reported on "Soviet Drama After the Resolution of the CPSU Central Committee 'On the Repertoire of Theaters and Measures for Its Improvement'"; V. Shcherbina reported on "Soviet Cinema After the Resolution of the CPSU Central Committee on the Film 'The Great Life'". After discussing these two reports and the situation of Soviet drama and film, the plenary session adopted a resolution. The second part of the resolution – the film part – is introduced below; the first part will be published in the next issue of this journal.
    　　——Editor

    Cinema is the most important and most mass-oriented art form. It has long become a true assistant to the Communist Party in the cause of educating the broad masses of Soviet working people. Soviet films promote communist ideas and narrate the great truth about our country, and they have won the love and recognition of working people all over the world.

    The success of Soviet cinema largely depends on the success of Soviet screenplays, because the foundation of a film is the screenplay.

    In the years since the establishment of Soviet power, a large number of writers who actively work in the field of screenwriting have emerged and grown, and they have created many well-known and creatively significant film scripts (such as P. Pavlenko, N. Wirta, E. Gabrilovich, B. Chirkov, M. Smirnova, A. Perventsev, G. Grebner, A. Dovzhenko, U. German, K. Vinogradskaya, K. Isaev, etc.).

    Guided by the historical decisions of the CPSU Central Committee that defined the basic tasks of Soviet art, screenwriters and directors have created many good screenplays and films (such as "The Vow," "Admiral Nakhimov," "Cruiser," "The Norsemen," "The Tale of the Land of Siberia," "The Russian Question," "The Village Teacher," "Navoi," "Michurin," "The Young Guard," "The Story of a Real Man," "The Third Blow," etc.), which prove the upsurge of our cinema.

    However, it should be pointed out that recently there have been some ideologically problematic and artistically not fully valuable film scripts and films, including "New House" (script by E. Shiko Pomiev), "Eastbound Train" (script by L. Malyugin), "Soloist in Ballet" (script by A. Ehrlich).

    The plenary session of the Council of the Soviet Writers' Union pointed out that the achievements of Soviet screenwriting are far from sufficient and do not meet the demands of our people for films. In particular, the backwardness of our screenwriting has now become the main obstacle to the further upsurge of Soviet film art.

    The historically significant decision of the CPSU Central Committee "On the Film 'The Great Life'" rightly pointed out: "One of the main reasons for the production of inappropriate films is the lack of understanding of the subject matter and the frivolous attitude of screenwriters and directors towards their work." The CPSU Central Committee exposed the most essential shortcomings in the practice of our screenwriters and pointed out the ways to overcome these shortcomings most quickly.

    At present, Soviet screenwriting has not yet solved all the tasks put before it by the decisions of the CPSU Central Committee on literature and art. This responsibility lies not only with the government film department but also with the Soviet Writers' Union.

    Until recently, the Writers' Union and its leadership have rarely studied the issues of screenwriting. Many writers have not realized in their creative practice that screenwriting is an original branch of literary creation, especially that adapting literary works into films is not a matter of mechanically and handcraftedly moving the episodes and protagonists from literary works to film scripts and then to the screen. The first stage of the work on the "Young Guard" film script and film was an example of this misdirection. Only thanks to the criticism of the Party did this task of adapting the novel find a correct solution.

    The Writers' Union's lack of concern for screenwriting issues has reached the point that no necessary conclusions were drawn from the criticism of P. Nilin's problematic script ("The Great Life" Part II). The Writers' Union did not heed the principled criticism of A. Dovzhenko's initial draft of the script for the film "Michurin" ("Life in Bloom") and the scripts and films "Light Shines on Russia" by N. Pogodin and S. Yutkevich.

    The councils of writers' unions in various member republics mostly rarely study screenwriting issues and do not provide film studios with real creative assistance. The Soviet Writers' Union rarely helps the writers' unions of various republics to cultivate screenwriting cadres, which has resulted in important scripts such as "The Baku Lights" (produced in Azerbaijan) and "The Dnieper Hydroelectric Station" (produced in Ukraine) not being completed.

    Among individual writers, one can still encounter the idea that screenplays are "inferior" literature and not worthy of the attention of rigorous literary figures. Such writers forget that writing screenplays requires the same sense of responsibility from writers as writing novels, poems, and plays.

    The plenary session of the Council of the Soviet Writers' Union resolutely condemns the attitude of belittling screenwriting work and emphasizes most firmly that Soviet screenwriting is one of the most important forms of artistic literature, with great political and national significance.

    The Writers' Union's Presidium and Secretariat's inattention to film and screenwriting issues is negatively reflected in the situation of film criticism. Among individual film workers – writers and critics – there still exist the politically indifferent artistic viewpoints condemned by the CPSU Central Committee's decisions on ideological issues, and a formalistic attitude towards film works. Film criticism has become divorced from other issues of Marxist-Leninist aesthetics. Books on film history and film theory suffer from theoretical weakness and sometimes contain obvious theoretical confusion. In these books, readers often encounter the fact of bowing down to American cinema, encounter obvious formalistic concepts and propositions (such as the articles by M. Bleiman and S. Yutkevich in the "Griffith" collection). The only reference book on screenwriting issues is V. Dulkin's old eclectic work "Introduction to Screenwriting." The recently published book "Outline of the History of Soviet Cinema" by N. Lebedev also contains elements of theoretical confusion.

    The Writers' Union's Presidium and its film committee have not united the outstanding forces of film criticism around themselves, have not obtained their assistance in exposing specific individuals who hold harmful and anti-people viewpoints regarding the tasks of Soviet cinema.

    The Writers' Union's screenwriting committee has not analyzed the articles on film issues published in Soviet publications and has not discussed the ideological and theoretical levels of the various issues of the "Film Art" magazine, which are very low.

    The screenwriters' lagging behind the needs of life, their lack of knowledge of life, their inability to observe life phenomena from the perspective of the overall national tasks of the people, and their insufficient study of the artistic forms of screenplays are still one of the main reasons for the ideological and artistic fragility of many film works. The Writers' Union has not provided creative and organizational assistance to writers working in the film field.

    The plenary session pointed out that the Writers' Union's screenwriting committee has not yet become a true creative center for screenwriting, helping the Writers' Union Council to solve the basic literary problems of film art and organize screenwriters. The screenwriting committees of the writers' unions of various republics have not yet been established.

    The plenary session requires the leadership of the Writers' Union to provide significant creative assistance to the development of screenwriting. It is the task of the Writers' Union to participate creatively in the government film department's preparation of screenplay theme plans, to propose and discuss new themes.

    The writing of screenplays by writers and the attraction of the most skilled writers to create new screenwriting works should all be a constant creative focus of the Writers' Union and its various leading bodies.

    The work plans of the Writers' Union's Secretariat and Presidium must stipulate in advance that new film scripts will be systematically discussed at their meetings.

    The Writers' Union's Presidium should help writers engaged in film work to better elucidate the most important phenomena and problems of modern times, to creatively send screenwriters to enterprises, new buildings, collective farms, scientific institutions, and schools, and to discuss writers' creative proposals and the results of their travels.

    The Writers' Union should attract writers to write film scripts that can be applied to the issues of communist education for children.

    The leadership of the screenplay research office of the Soviet government film department should regularly inform writers of the progress of screenplay writing work.

    The plenary session recommended that the Writers' Union's Presidium appoint several skilled writers to participate in the artistic committees of film studios, instructing them to actively participate in this most important work.

    The plenary session believes that it is necessary to strengthen the screenplay research departments of film studios with highly skilled editors, and in this matter, the Writers' Union should provide practical assistance to the Soviet government film department.

    The plenary session charged the Writers' Union's screenwriting committee and the literary theory and literary criticism committee to more actively participate in the study of film history and film theory. Efforts must be made to assist in the improvement of the work of the magazine "Film Art" so that this magazine becomes a militant organ of Bolshevik criticism in the field of film research.

    The plenary session charged "Literary Gazette" to systematically elaborate on the issues of film and screenwriting in its pages. Excellent screenwriting works should be published in the Writers' Union's magazines – "New World," "October," "Banner," "Star." The pages of these magazines must also be provided for the discussion of film and screenwriting issues.

    The plenary session called the attention of the Soviet government film department to the matter of screenwriter cadre education, especially the poor equipment of the All-Union State Institute of Cinematography, and the Writers' Union is prepared to help the government film department enrich the teaching staff of the institute with skilled literary figures.

    The plenary session pointed out the importance of fully strengthening the friendly cooperation in creation between screenwriters and directors, because experience has shown that this can assist in the creation of highly artistic film works in many ways.

    The plenary session of the Council of the Soviet Writers' Union calls on the nation's outstanding writers to create film creations needed by the Soviet people, to create screenwriting works at such an ideological and artistic level and in such quantity that can guarantee the powerful development of the most mass-oriented and people's art – the great Soviet cinema.

### 苏联作家协会理事会第十二次全会　关于戏剧电影的决议

　　苏联作家协会理事会第十二次全会
  　关于戏剧电影的决议
    在苏联作家协会理事会第十二次全会（一九四八年十二月）上，Ａ·索夫罗诺夫报告了“联共中央‘关于剧院上演目录及其改进办法’决议颁布后的苏维埃戏剧”；Ｖ·谢尔宾娜报告了“联共中央关于‘伟大的生活’影片决议颁布后的苏维埃电影”。该全会讨论了这两个报告和苏维埃戏剧与电影的情况后，曾通过了一个决议。兹将该决议第二部分——电影部分介绍于后；其第一部分将在本刊下期登载。
    　　——编者
    电影乃是艺术中最重要的最群众化的艺术。它早已成了共产党在教育苏联广大劳动群众的事业上真正的助手。苏维埃影片宣传共产主义思想，叙述关于我国的伟大真理，它博得了全世界劳动者的热爱与公认。
    苏联电影的成绩，在很大的程度上乃是苏联电影剧的成绩，因为影片基础之基础，乃是电影脚本。
    在苏维埃政权建立以来的年代中，产生和成长了大量在电影剧方面积极工作的作家，他们创作了许多极闻名而有创作意义的电影脚本（例如Ｐ·巴甫连科、Ｎ·维尔达、Ｅ·加布利洛维奇、Ｂ·契尔斯科夫、Ｍ·斯密尔诺娃、Ａ·辟尔文切夫、Ｇ·格列布涅尔、Ａ·杜夫仁科、Ｕ·格尔曼，Ｋ·文诺格拉德斯卡雅，Ｋ·伊萨耶夫等）。
    以联共中央确定苏维埃艺术基本任务的各项有历史意义的决定为指南，电影剧作家们和导演们创作了许多好的电影脚本与影片（例如“宣誓”、“那希莫夫”、“巡洋舰”、“北欧海贼”、“关于西伯利亚土地的传说”、“俄罗斯问题”、“乡村女教师”、“那伏伊”、“米邱林”、“青年近卫军”、“一个真有的人的故事”、“第三次打击”等），这些脚本和影片证明了我们电影的高涨。
    但应当指出，最近却出现了若干思想上有毛病、艺术上不是完全有价值的电影脚本和影片，其中包括“新屋”（脚本，为Ｅ希科·波米夫所作），“东行列车”（脚本，为Ｌ·马流金所作），“舞剧中的女独唱者”（脚本，为Ａ·埃尔里赫所作）。
    苏联作家协会理事会全会指出，苏维埃电影剧的成绩是很不够的，是不符我们的人民对于电影所提出的要求的。尤其，我们电影剧的落后，在现在成了苏维埃电影艺术进一步高涨的主要障碍。
    联共中央“关于‘伟大的生活’影片”的有历史意义的决定，曾完全正当地指出：“出产不适当的影片的基本原因之一，乃是不认识对象，乃是电影编剧家、导演对自己的业务采取了轻率的态度”。联共中央揭发了我们电影剧作家实践中的最本质的缺点，并指示了最迅速地克服这些缺点的道路。
    目前，苏维埃电影剧还没有解决联共中央关于文学和艺术问题各项决定所提出于电影剧面前的一切任务。这一责任不仅在政府电影部方面，而且也在苏维埃作家协会方面。
    直到最近，作家协会及其领导还很少研究电影剧的问题。许多作家在其创作实践中没有意识到，电影剧乃是文学创作的一个原始部门，尤其是文学作品的改编为电影，并不是将文学作品中的各个插曲与主人翁机械地、手工业地搬到电影脚本中去，再搬到银幕上去。“青年近卫军”电影脚本与影片的第一阶段工作，便是这种误入歧途的例子。只是由于党的批评，改编小说的这一任务才找到了正确的解决。
    作家协会对于电影剧问题的不关心，竟达到从对于Ｐ·尼林的有毛病的脚本（“伟大的生活”第二集）的批评中没有作出必要的结论。作家协会没有理会Ａ·杜夫仁科“米邱林”这一脚本影片初稿（“花中的生活”）及Ｎ·包高亭、和Ｓ·尤特基维奇脚本与影片“光明照耀俄罗斯”所受到的党的有原则的批评。
    各加盟共和国作家协会理事会，大都很少研究电影剧的问题，没有给予电影制片厂以真正的创造性的帮助。苏联作家协会很少帮助各共和国作家协会培养电影剧作家干部，从而使“巴库之火”（阿塞拜疆出品）及“德聂泊水力发电站”（乌克兰出品）之类的重要脚本没有得到结局。
    在个别作家中，还可以遇见这样一种观念：认为脚本为“次等”文学，值不得谨严的文学家的注意。这种作家忘记了著作脚本，要求作家要有象著作小说、诗歌、剧本一样的责任心。
    苏联作家协会理事会全会断然地谴责轻视脚本业务的态度，并极坚决地着重指出，苏维埃电影剧乃是艺术文学最重要的样式之一，它有巨大的政治的和国家的意义。
    作家协会主席团与书记处对于电影及电影剧问题的不注意，否定地表现在电影批评的情况上。在个别的电影工作者——作家与批评家——中，还存在着联共中央关于思想问题各项决定所谴责的漠视政治的艺术观点，及对电影作品的形式主义的态度。电影的批评脱离了马克思列宁主义美学的其他问题。关于电影历史与电影理论的书籍，都有着理论上的贫弱的弊病，有时候有着显明的理论上的糊涂观点。读者在这些书籍中，常常遇见拜倒于美国电影之前的事实，遇见显明的形式主义的概念和命题（例如Ｍ·布列曼与Ｓ·尤特基维奇在“格利菲斯”论文集中的文章）。关于脚本问题的唯一参考书，乃是Ｖ·杜尔金的一本陈旧的折衷派的著作“电影剧概论”。不久以前出版的Ｎ·列别杰夫所著的“苏联电影史概论”一书，也含有理论上的混乱的成份。
    作家协会主席团及其电影委员会，没有将电影批评的优秀力量团结在自己的周围，没有取得他们的帮助，以揭露对于苏联电影任务抱着有害的、反人民的观点的具体人物。
    作家协会的电影剧委员会没有分析苏联刊物上登载的论电影问题的文章，没有讨论思想水平和理论水平都很低的各期“电影艺术”杂志。
    电影编剧家之落后于生活的需要，不知道生活，不会从全体人民的、国家的大任务上观察生活现象，对于脚本艺术形式之研究不足，仍是许多电影剧作品之思想上和艺术上脆弱的主要原因之一。作家协会没有在创作上和组织上帮助在电影方面工作的作家。
    全会指出，作家协会电影剧委员会还没有成为电影剧的真正的创作中心，帮助作家协会理事会解决电影艺术的基本的文学问题和组织电影编剧家。各共和国作家协会电影剧委员会至今尚未成立。
    全会要求作家协会领导方面对于电影剧的发展给予重大的创造性的帮助。有创造性地参加政府电影部编制准备脚本主题的计划，提出并讨论新的主题，乃是作家协会的任务。
    作家著作脚本，吸引最熟练的作家创造新的电影剧作品，都应该是作家协会及其各领导机关的经常的创造性的注意之场所。
    在作家协会书记处与主席团的工作计划中，必须预先规定要在自己的会议上有系统地讨论新的电影脚本。
    作家协会主席团应该帮助从事于电影工作的作家，更好地阐明现代最主要的现象和问题，实行创造性地派遣电影编剧家到企业、新建筑物、集体农场、科学机关、学校中去，讨论作家的创作意见书及其旅行结果。
    作家协会应该吸引作家去著作可以应用于儿童共产主义教育问题的电影脚本。
    苏联政府电影部脚本研究室的领导方面，应该经常地向作家通知创作脚本工作的进度。
    全会建议作家协会主席团指定若干熟练的作家参加制片厂的艺术委员会，责成他们必须积极地参加这一最重要的工作。
    全会认为必须用高度熟练的编辑去加强电影制片厂的脚本研究部，在这一事件上，作家协会应该对苏联政府电影部予以实际的帮助。
    全会责成作家协会电影剧委员会及文学理论与文学批评委员会更积极地参加对于电影史及电影理论的研究。必须尽力协助“电影艺术”这一杂志工作的改进，使这一杂志成为电影研究方面的布尔什维克批评的战斗的机关刊物。
    全会责成“文学报”在其篇幅上有系统地阐明电影及电影剧的问题。优秀的电影剧作品应该在作家协会的杂志——“新世界”、“十月”、“旗帜”、“星”——上发表。这些杂志的篇幅也必须提供讨论电影及电影剧问题之用。
    全会提请苏联政府电影部注意编剧家干部教育事情，特别是全苏国立电影专科学校的恶劣设备，作家协会准备帮助政府电影部用熟练的文学家去充实该校的教师阵容。
    全会指出全力加强编剧与导演在创作上的友好合作之重要性，因为经验所显示的，这在许多方面可以协助高度艺术的电影作品的创作。
    苏联作家协会理事会全会号召全国的优秀作家来创作苏维埃人民所需要的电影创作品，在这样的思想水平与艺术水平上及数量上创作电影剧作品，这种水平和数量可以保证最群众的和人民的艺术———伟大的苏维埃电影强大发展。
