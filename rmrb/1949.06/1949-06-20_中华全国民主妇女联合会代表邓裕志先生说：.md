　　Representative Deng Yuzhi of the All-China Democratic Women's Federation said:
    Only after liberation can there be a truly representative preparatory meeting for the new CPPCC, where all opinions can be expressed. Especially for women, in the past, most were just invited as token representatives to make up the numbers. Now, they are selected from their own organizations, and this also includes representatives of working-class and peasant women. In the past, women rarely participated in politics. In the future, they must work hard to study and cooperate with all parties to build a new democratic country. Women should pay attention to organizing their strength, which is a very formidable force. In the old society, women were confined to their families, but now there is no such resistance in society. It depends on how women act.

    At the meeting, everyone had a feeling that they could finally breathe a sigh of relief, stand up, and build our own country with confidence. Naturally, this is an extremely arduous task. Every day, every ordinary person must realize this and work towards the same goal, then success will be inevitable.

    After this preparatory meeting, the representatives must go back to convey the decisions made at the meeting, collect opinions from all parties, and then hold a formal New CPPCC meeting.

### 中华全国民主妇女联合会代表邓裕志先生说：

　　中华全国民主妇女联合会代表邓裕志先生说：
    只有在解放后才能有真正代表民意的新政协筹备会的召开，可以把各方面的意见表达出来。尤其是妇女，过去多半是邀一邀请一请，凑凑数的，现在则从自己的机构里选出来，而且还包括了工农妇女代表。妇女过去参加政治很少，今后还要努力学习，努力与各方面合作，建设新民主主义国家。妇女要注意把力量组织起来，这是很可惊的力量。过去的旧社会里，妇女被束缚在家庭里，现在社会上没有这种阻力了，要看妇女如何去做的了。
    在会上大家有这样的一种感觉，是透过一口气来，可以站起来了，可以放手放脚的建立我们自己的国家了。自然这是万分艰巨的工作，要在平常的每一天，使平常的每一个人都体会到，都向同一方向努力，这成功就将是必然的了。
    这次筹备会议开完后，各代表要回去传达会上的决定，要收集各方面的意见，来开正式的新政协会议。
