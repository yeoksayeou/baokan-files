Original Text of the Proposal from the Northeast Railway Workers' General Union: To the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, forwarding to all local railway unions and railway worker brothers throughout the country: Under the leadership of our own political party—the Chinese Communist Party—and our wise leader Chairman Mao, we, the railway workers of the whole country, have gone through more than twenty years of heroic struggle, and now we are approaching the complete victory of liberation. From the Northeast to the vast areas south of the Yangtze River, the vast majority of railway lines have become the property of the people, and we have become the masters of China's railways. At present, the central task and mission facing Chinese railway workers is to rapidly restore the original railways throughout the country and build new railways to support the final victory of the People's Liberation War and to promote the rapid development of production. Based on our experience in the Northeast over the past three years, we firmly believe that in order to complete this glorious task, in addition to obeying the leadership of the Railway Department of the Chinese People's Revolutionary Military Commission and the railway administration bureaus of various regions, we must also quickly establish the highest leading body of the national railway workers' organization in order to better exchange experiences, learn from each other, unify our will, align our steps, and more effectively complete the great cause of the people's railways. The All-China Federation of Trade Unions' Standing Committee enlarged meeting on May 30th resolved to appoint Comrade Li Jiebo to be responsible for preparing for the establishment of the National Railway General Union. The news was extremely exciting. We hereby represent the 160,000 workers of the Northeast Railway in fully supporting this resolution, and propose that on July 1st, the 28th anniversary of the Chinese Communist Party, a temporary national railway representative meeting be held in Beiping to establish a preparatory committee for the restoration of the National Railway General Union to carry out all preparatory and restoration work. Because the National Railway General Union was established more than 25 years ago, it was one of the earliest and most glorious trade unions in China's industrial unions. Now, restoring this organization will definitely be unanimously supported by railway workers across the country. We request the All-China Federation of Trade Unions to decide how to convene this meeting and how the railways in various regions should select representatives, and to publish this proposal. We earnestly hope to quickly obtain the approval of railway worker brothers across the country. Northeast Railway Workers' General Union, June 4th.

　　东北铁总建议原文
    东北铁路职工总会建议原文如下：中华全国总工会转全国各地铁路工会暨全国铁路职工弟兄们：我们全国铁路职工在自己的政党——中国共产党和自己的英明的领袖毛主席的领导下经过了二十多年的英勇斗争，现在已经接近完全解放的胜利了。从东北到江南的广大地区，绝大部分的铁路线已经为人民所有，我们已经成了中国铁路的主人。目前摆在中国铁路职工面前的中心工作与任务，就是迅速恢复全国原有铁路和建设新的铁路以支援人民解放战争的最后胜利，以推进生产事业的迅速发展，根据我们东北三年来的经验，我们深信要完成这一光荣任务，除了服从中国人民革命军事委员会铁道部及各区铁路管理局的领导外，还必须迅速建立全国铁路职工组织的最高领导机关，才能更好交流经验，相互学习，统一意志，整齐步伐，更有效地完成人民铁路的伟大事业。中华全国总工会五月三十日常委会扩大会议决议，指定李颉伯同志负责筹备建立全国铁路总工会的工作。消息传来，不胜兴奋。兹谨代表东北铁路十六万职工完全拥护这一决议，并提议于七月一日，中国共产党二十八周年纪念日，在北平召开临时全国铁路代表会议成立恢复全国铁路总工会筹备委员会，进行一切筹备恢复工作。因为全国铁路总工会在二十五年以前业已建立，它在中国产业工会中是建立得最早而最有光荣斗争传统的一个，现在恢复这一组织，一定是全国铁路工人所一致拥护的，这次会议应如何召集，各地铁路如何选派代表，即请中华全国总工会决定并发布这一提议，我们恳切希望能够迅速获得全国铁路职工弟兄们的赞同。东北铁路职工总会六月四日
