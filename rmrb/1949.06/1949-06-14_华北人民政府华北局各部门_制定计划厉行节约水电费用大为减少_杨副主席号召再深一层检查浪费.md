　　Huaibei People's Government and North China Bureau Departments
　　Formulate Plans to Vigorously Practice Economy, Water and Electricity Costs Greatly Reduced.
　　Yang Vice-Chairman Calls for Deeper Inspection of Waste
　　[Reported by this newspaper] The Huaibei People's Government, the departments of the North China Bureau, and directly affiliated units are responding to Chairman Dong Biwu's and Comrade Bo Yibo's call for economy and this newspaper's call for saving and preparing for shortages. The economy drive has been launched sequentially, and significant results have been achieved after each department has detailed economy measures. The Supervision Institute first paid attention to the ideological education of cadres and miscellaneous staff, even adopting a lecturing approach to publicize the significance of economy. The 100-candlepower light bulbs in the institute have been completely eliminated, and the total number of lights has been reduced from 2,665 to 1,750. Vice Minister Zhang of the Ministry of Agriculture influences every comrade with practical actions. He is thrifty and frugal on weekdays, and he is unwilling to waste even a piece of paper or a drop of ink without reason. Therefore, under his influence, comrades who do administrative work learn knowledge about repairing electric lights, tap water, bicycles, and other equipment to save public funds. For example, when a piece of the kitchen roof collapsed a few days ago, the cooks repaired it themselves. When a large bedroom needed to be divided into two rooms, the service personnel also partitioned it well. The club of the ministry also formulated a covenant stipulating that doors, windows, furniture, vehicles, etc., must be carefully used to extend the life of public property. The supply and marketing cooperative training class made spring clothes, and because they were able to seize the time to deal with it, they saved more than 40,000 yuan when some departments reflected that the spring clothing costs were not enough, and they handed it over to the administrative office in full, achieving the spirit of every little bit going to the public. In addition, departments such as the Ministry of Finance and the Secretariat have formulated management methods for the use of electricity, water, stationery, and paper. In order to promote economy, the Secretariat of the North China People's Government has also compiled and printed a "Economy Newsletter" to report on the economy news of various departments. Vice Chairman Yang Xiufeng further elaborated on the significance of economy in the introductory remarks he wrote for the publication, saying: "Economy is not a passive 'not using what should be used, not spending what should be spent', but saving what is not urgently needed, avoiding and overcoming waste, in order to accumulate capital for productive undertakings, especially production." He reminded everyone: "Because economy is not passive, economy seems easy, but it is actually not easy to do. We must have a resolute will to work hard and overcome difficulties in order to be both economical and mentally happy, and improve work efficiency." Finally, he called on everyone to conduct a deeper inspection of waste.
　　Units such as the Propaganda Department, Organization Department, Research Office, Administrative Office, and Secretariat of the North China Bureau first inspected the phenomenon of over-subscribing to Pingjin newspapers. After changing the distribution method, it did not hinder everyone's reading convenience, but saved the cost of 60 newspapers per month. At the same time, large light bulbs and electric stoves have been cancelled. Now each office only leaves one 60-candlepower light bulb. Small light bulbs have been replaced in corridors, toilets, and dormitories, and all places are turned off by 11:00 pm at the latest. The wires in each place have also been replaced with new wires to avoid leakage. In the past, water was also used very wastefully. In the past, when mopping the floor, the faucet was turned on and washed arbitrarily, and some were negligent in inspection and repair, and there were many leaks. For example, the water pipe in the hygiene department leaked. Without paying attention, as much as 623 tons of water was consumed in April. After saving water, the water meter was checked on the 12th of this month, and 100 tons of water had been used again. It was found that the water pipe was leaking and repaired immediately to avoid further waste. Facts have proved that regular inspection of wires and water pipes is an important method of saving water and electricity. In addition, due to the installation of electric bells in the office, duty personnel are concentrated to listen to instructions for work, and ten fewer duty personnel have been used in May. Other aspects, such as the use of waste paper and saving gasoline, have been given considerable attention in various places.

　　华北人民政府华北局各部门
  　制定计划厉行节约水电费用大为减少
    杨副主席号召再深一层检查浪费
    【本报讯】华北人民政府、华北局各部门和直属单位响应董必武主席、薄一波同志提倡节约以及本报节约备荒的号召，节约运动次第展开，各部门详细规定节约办法后，已取得显著效果。监察院首先注意对于干部及杂勤人员的思想教育，甚至采用上课的方式，以宣传节约的意义。该院一百支光的大灯泡已经完全取消，灯光总数已由二千六百六十五支减至一千七百五十支。农业部张副部长，以实际行动影响着每个同志，平日他省化俭用，一片纸一滴墨也不肯无故用掉。因此作事务工作的同志们在他感召下，都自己学习关于电灯、自来水、脚踏车和其他设备的修理知识以节省公款，如日前该部厨房顶塌了一块，炊事员就动手修补，有一个大寝室要分隔为两间，服务员也把它间隔好了。该部俱乐部还订出了公约，规定门窗家具、车辆等都必须留心使用，以延长公物的寿命。供销合作总社训练班制作春衣，因为能抓紧时间处理，所以在一些部门反映春衣费不够的时候，他们却节省了四万余元，并悉数缴交行政处，做到了涓滴归公的精神。此外如财政部及秘书厅6等部门均订出关于用电用水及文具纸张的使用管理办法。华北人民政府秘书厅为提倡节约，并已编印“节约通讯”刊物，报导各部门节约的消息，杨秀峰副主席在为该刊所写的代发刊词中，进一步的阐述了节约的意义，他说：“节约不是消极的‘该用不用，该花不花’，而是节省不急之需，避免与克服浪费，以求积累资本用于生产事业，特别是生产”，他提醒大家说：“因为节约不是消极的，所以节约象似容易，实际并不易办，必须有刻苦努力克服困难的坚决意志才能既节约而又精神愉快，提高工作效率。”最后，他号召大家再深一层检查浪费。
    华北局宣传部、组织部、研究室、行政处、秘书处等单位，首先检查了过多订阅平津报纸的现象，经过改变分配办法，并未妨碍大家阅读的方便，每月却节省了六十份报纸费用的开支。同时大灯泡和电炉都取消了，现在每一办公室只留下一盏六十支光的电灯，走廊、厕所、宿舍都换上了小灯泡，每晚最迟十一时，各处均熄灯了。各处电线又换了新线，以免漏电。过去用水也非常浪费，以前擦地板打开龙头，任意冲洗，有的疏于检查修理，漏水极多，如卫生科水管漏水，未经注意，四月份竟耗水达六百二十三公吨，经过节省用水，在本月十二日检查水表，又已用水一百公吨，发现是水管漏水，当即修理以免再浪费。事实证明，电线及自来水管的经常检查，是节约水电的重要方法。此外，由于办公室按装电铃，勤务员集中听候吩咐工作，五月份已少用十名勤务员。其他如利用废纸、节省汽油等，各处都已相当注意。
