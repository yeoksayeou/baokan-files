　　The British Labour Party Reveals its True Colors

　　The British Labour Party's leadership demonstrated obvious tyranny and incompetence at its 48th annual conference. Its corrupt political achievements have aroused strong dissatisfaction among the people and fierce criticism from party members. Representatives from various regions and trade unions questioned them: "Why is there so little emphasis on preventing fascism?" "Now that the railways have been nationalized, why are workers not allowed to participate in effective management?" Bevan and others equivocated. When the assembly voted to prohibit progressive party member Zilliacus from stating his reasons, nearly two million votes were cast against the ban. The awkward and embarrassing state of Bevan and others is difficult to describe! The Labour Party's "socialist" guise can no longer conceal its imperialist face. As early as 1919, Lenin gave these Labour Party leaders a merciless exposure: "The bourgeoisie needs such servants who can gain the trust of a section of the working class, who can disguise the bourgeoisie with arguments about the viability of some reformist path, and use this argument to deceive the people...in this way luring the people away from the revolution." Now these "servants" are revealing their ugly true form.

　　英工党现出了真面目
    英国工党的领导机构，在其四十八届年会上所表现的专横与无能是非常明显的。它的腐朽政绩已引起了人民的强烈不满，也引起了党员的猛烈抨击。各地区各工会的代表们向他们质问：“为什么对于防止法西斯工作毫不重视？”“铁路收归国有了，为什么不允许工人参加有效管理？”贝文等却含糊其词。在大会表决禁止进步党员齐里亚库斯申述理由时，投反对票者近二百万，贝文等的尴尬窘态是难以描述的！工党的“社会主义”幌子已遮不住它的帝国主义面目。早在一九一九年，列宁便给这批工党头子们以无情的揭露：“资产阶级需要这类奴仆，他们要能取得工人阶级中一部分人的信任，要能用什么改良主义道路是行得通的论调去装扮资产阶级，并借这种论调去蒙蔽人民的耳目……这样来引诱人民离开革命。”现在这些“奴仆们”正现出了它的丑恶原形。
