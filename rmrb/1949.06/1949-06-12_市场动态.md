　　Market Dynamics
    Grain: Opening prices rose immediately, and the volume of transactions was also higher than the previous day. In recent days, prices in Shanghai have fluctuated slightly, and grain and cotton cloth prices in this city have also been affected. However, yesterday there were no large-scale transactions in grain sales and purchases, so prices showed a decline at the close.
    Cotton Cloth: Cotton cloth was affected by the return of funds from Qingdao and Shanghai earlier than grain. Yesterday, cotton slightly increased, while cloth fell back, and there were very few buyers. The prices of Erchang and Wufu fabrics fell by 700-800 yuan, which is more than 1,000 yuan lower than Tianjin.
    Sundries: Prices rose, but merchants were hesitant. Raw materials and paper rose more, while cigarettes and matches were sluggish. Kerosene continued to rise, with each barrel exceeding gasoline by 5,000 yuan. Sesame oil and white oil prices were too low, and rose slightly yesterday. Northeast soybean oil and Zhangjiakou sesame oil, due to lack of profit, were partly shipped back after arriving in Beiping.

　　市场动态
    粮食：开盘价即升，成交数量亦比前日为多。近几天来上海物价稍有波动，本市粮食纱布价格亦受影响。但昨粮食收售均无大量成交，故收盘时价格已显回落。
    纱布：纱布受青岛上海回头资金影响较粮食为先，昨纱略升，布则回落，买主亦甚少。二厂五福下落七、八百元，较天津低千余元。
    杂货：价升，但商人气软。原料、纸张上涨较多，纸烟火柴疲滞。煤油则续涨，每桶竟超过汽油五千元。香油、白油价太低，昨日稍升。东北豆油、张家口麻油、因无利可图，运到北平后又有一部运回。
