　　Guangzong Exceeds Seed Selection Task
    [Jinan Telegram] Guangzong farmers, recognizing the benefits of seed selection for increasing production, have launched a seed selection craze, now completing 33,000 jin. After accepting the administrative office's task of selecting 30,000 jin of wheat seeds, the county made arrangements at each level before the wheat harvest. Led by village cadres and party members, villages joined the seed selection craze. In addition to selecting "Guangzong White," which had been tested at the Linqing Farm and produced a high yield, they also selected the "Hulutou" variety, which is wind-resistant and does not lose grains, and the early-maturing Xiaobaimang variety. The method of selection is generally to remove miscellaneous ears or to cut and thresh separately; for pure wheat varieties, the field selection method is used. In addition to keeping the selected improved varieties for their own use, they are voluntarily sent to the promotion society for exchange. Currently, the county has received 33,600 jin, exceeding the original plan by more than 3,000 jin.
    [Another Telegram] The trial planting of "Guangzong White" wheat in Pingxiang has been effective. This year, they will continue to select seeds in preparation for promotion.
    [Another Telegram] Farmers in Zhangzhuangqiao, a suburb of Handan, are selecting wheat seeds locally. Initially, party member Zhao Lin said, "I haven't selected seeds for sixty years, and I haven't harvested any less than anyone else." District cadres guided everyone to discuss and realize that seed selection can lead to even germination, large yields, drought and cold resistance, and insect resistance. They compared the wheat in the village that was affected by black and yellow jaundice with the wheat that was not affected by pests to prove the importance of seed selection, dispelling the idea of not selecting seeds. They also identified the "Foreign Monk Head" and "White Monk Head" varieties as the best, deciding that cadres, party members, and skilled producers should select first and then lead the masses to carry out the selection universally. Skilled producers Du Yushan and five other households with sixteen mu of "Foreign Monk Head" wheat cut and threshed separately. Zhang Jilin's wheat ears were not pure, so he picked them one by one, dried them, threshed them separately, and stored them. Currently, about 80 percent of the 580 households in the village have joined the seed selection craze. The remaining households are exchanging for other people's excellent varieties at equal value.
    [Taiyue Telegram] Wheat harvesting has begun in Yangcheng District One. According to a survey by the District Office, much wheat has rotted again this year. The District Office's research into the cause of the mold identified the wheat seed as the main factor. Therefore, on the 7th of this month, during the school holidays, a meeting of elementary school teachers from each village was convened to organize publicity for wheat seed selection among the masses, designating the 8th to 14th of this month as a publicity week, using street blackboards, holding seminars, and expanding broadcasting stations to specifically explain the causes of moldy wheat and the benefits of seed selection. Sixty-five teachers organized thirteen propaganda teams, which have now gone to the countryside to promote wheat seed selection.

　　广宗选种超过任务
    【冀南电】广宗农民认识了选种对增产的好处，掀起选种热潮，现已完成三万三千斤。该县自接受行署选麦种三万斤任务后，麦收前即逐级作了布置，各村在村干部、党员的带领下，纷纷卷入选种热潮。除选曾在临清农场试验产量较多的“广宗白”外，又选到抗风不磨粒的系“葫芦头”和早熟的小白芒两种。选种方法一般的是拔去杂穗，或单割单打；麦种纯净的则用场选法。所选良种除留下自己用外，纷纷自动送到推进社交换。现全县已收到三万三千六百斤，超过原订计划三千余斤。
    【又电】平乡试种“广宗白”小麦，效果良好。今年继续选种，准备推广。
    【又电】邯郸市郊张庄桥农民就地选麦种。开始党员赵林说：“六十年俺没选过种，比谁也不少收。区干引导大家讨论，认识到选种能使发苗齐、收量大、抗旱抗冷、不生虫害，并以本村生黑、黄疽的麦和没受虫害的相比较，证明选种的重要打通了不选种思想。又研究出“洋和尚头”和“白和尚头”二种最好，确定干部、党员、生产能手先选，再带领群众普遍进行。生产能手杜玉善等五户十六亩“洋和尚头”麦，即另割另打；张吉林的麦穗籽不纯，他一根一根的挑选，并晒干打了另存起来。现全村五百八十余户，已有百分之八十左右的户投入选种热潮。其余各户正以等价交换办法，换取别人的优良品种。
    【太岳电】阳城一区麦子开始收割。据区公所调查，今年许多麦子又被霉坏了。区公所研究生霉原因主要是麦种关系，因此特于本月七日趁学校放假期间，召开各村小学教员开会，组织向群众宣传麦子选种，确定本月八日至十四日为宣传周，运用街头黑板、开座谈会、扩播台等方式，具体说明霉麦的原因和选种的好处。六十五个教员，组织了十三个宣传组，现已分头下乡，进行麦子选种宣传。
