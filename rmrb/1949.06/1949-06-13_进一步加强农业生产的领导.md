A Short Commentary:

    Further Strengthen the Leadership of Agricultural Production

    This year's spring plowing and sowing was completed while fighting against severe drought, insect plagues, and various natural disasters such as wind, hail, and frost. Party and government leading organs at all levels have achieved excellent results in organizing the people to fight against various disasters. In areas such as Central Hebei, Southern Hebei, and Hebei-Shandong-Henan, in order to ensure cotton sowing, mutual assistance in digging wells and repairing canals was organized promptly and universally among farmers. The leadership, with an unwavering attitude, persuaded the masses to abandon their wait-for-rain mentality and overcame various difficulties in the well-digging work, ensuring the sowing of cotton. Insect plagues occurred successively in more than 80 counties throughout the region, but because various localities adopted the approach of immediate detection and immediate eradication, the plagues were prevented from spreading and causing harm. In the struggle against disasters such as wind, hail, and frost, all localities invariably organized timely replanting and seedling protection work. Looking at the overall situation in the region, in general, the sowing task has been largely completed, which is a major achievement. The current problems (mainly below the county level) are: first, in the face of the new national victory, there is insufficient understanding and estimation of the importance of increasing agricultural production. Some even mistakenly believe that "the focus of leadership has shifted to the cities, the tasks of rural work are simple, and there have been several years of production foundation, so there are no difficulties." Second, formalism in leadership methods is still serious. Some are still satisfied with large-scale arrangements, general appeals, and statistical figures. It is said that a district cadre in Licheng spent six days of a ten-day work period behind closed doors compiling statistical figures for production reports (false reports have been found in many places), while failing to guide the masses in discussing and resolving some specific problems that exist among them, such as fear that weeding wheat will kill it and how to solve the problem of autumn fertilizer after applying topdressing. This erroneous understanding of agricultural production and this formalistic leadership method are a major obstacle to completing this year's production increase task.

    In addition, we believe that this year's agricultural production plan above the county level is quite thorough, but the leadership has not grasped it tightly enough. To be precise, it has not been grasped concretely, especially in failing to implement it well at the lower levels. The county level is a critical link in this. Therefore, we have repeatedly hoped that various localities would strengthen leadership below the county level. From recent observations, several places have made significant progress, but we still hope that comrades working in some counties and districts will pay attention to the following points:

    First, the county leadership must go deep into the villages and deep into the farmers, relying on the masses to summarize typical experiences that are suitable for today's needs, in order to promote the general through the specific and to form a mass production movement with leadership. To this end, it is necessary to give full play to the good experiences that were approved by the masses during the War of Resistance Against Japan and the People's Liberation War (such as voluntary mutual assistance, mutual benefit, democratic equivalent exchange, and various mass-based mutual aid labor exchange methods) and continue to apply them to today's production movement. On the other hand, it is also necessary to assess new situations and conditions to propose new methods. For example, under the conditions of the complete liberation of North China, urban-rural mutual assistance should be carried out. How to fully utilize urban forces to solve the difficulties in agricultural production that could not be well resolved in the past is a new issue for us. We hope that leaders at all levels will pay attention to uncovering problems, summarizing experiences, overcoming various difficulties, and guiding the production movement in a timely manner, rather than using old-fashioned empirical methods to lead production. The many failed lessons in sowing should arouse our vigilance.

    Second, in conjunction with current production requirements, mobilize the enthusiasm of all cadres to learn agricultural technology and methods for combining science with farmers' experiences. Leading cadres should set an example by truly learning from farmers, promoting their good experiences, and also striving for the assistance of urban technical forces to learn scientific technology and guide farmers to improve certain backward aspects. In this way, the work of popularizing technology and increasing yields can be transformed into a mass movement, rather than limiting the work of popularizing technology to a small circle.

    Third, conduct thorough inspection work at any time, and closely grasp agricultural conditions. Methods that only pay attention to statistics without going deep into the masses to lead mass production must be criticized and corrected. During inspections, attention should be paid to commending and rewarding cadres who have methods for leading mass production and the masses who actively participate in labor. In the past, because our leadership work was not thorough enough, counties and districts only approached village cadres and a few old labor heroes when they went to the villages, without going deep into the general masses. Therefore, situations of commending for the sake of commending occurred. Some who should not have been commended were commended, causing commendations and rewards to lose their due effect. During this spring's production movement, we have not heard of the discovery of new activists, and a large-scale mass production upsurge has not been formed, which may be related to this.

    Currently, we are in a busy and tense season of wheat harvesting, summer planting, replanting, and weeding. Moreover, insect plagues and hailstorms occur from time to time. It is necessary to specifically lead the masses to wage a tenacious struggle in order to overcome difficulties and ensure the completion of agricultural production tasks.

### 进一步加强农业生产的领导

　　进一步加强农业生产的领导
    今年的春耕播种，是在与苦旱、虫灾、以及风、雹、冻等各种自然灾害作斗争中完成的。各级党政领导机关，在组织人民与各种灾害作斗争中，获得了极好的成绩。冀中、冀南、冀鲁豫等地区，在保证棉花的播种中，及时地与普遍地组织了农民的互助挖井与修渠等工作，领导上以坚定不移的态度，说服了群众的等雨思想，并克服了挖井工作中的种种困难，保证了棉花下种。虫灾曾先后在全区的八十余县中发生，但由于各地采取了随发现、随扑灭，因而未使蔓延为害。在与风、雹、冻等灾害作斗争中，各地都无例外地组织了及时的补种与保苗的工作。从全区总的情况看，一般地说，播种任务大体已经完成，这是一件大事。目前存在的问题（主要是县以下），一是在新的全国胜利的面前，对于提高农业生产认识与估计不足。甚至有的竟错误地以为：“领导工作重点转移到城市了，农村工作的任务就简单了，生产已经有了几年的基础，没有什么困难。”二是在领导方法上形式主义依然严重，有的仍满足于大会布置、一般号召，和数目字的统计。据说黎城一个区干部，在十天的工作中，曾经以六天的时间来关门统计数目字作生产汇报（许多地方发现了假报告），而对于群众中所存在的一些具体的问题，如怕锄麦要锄死，上了追肥，秋苗肥如何解决等困难，反而未能引导他们讨论与解决。这种对农业生产的错误认识与这种形式主义的领导方法，对于完成今年的增产任务来说，是一个很大的障碍。
    此外我们认为今年县以上的农业生产计划是相当周密的，但是在领导上却抓的不够紧，恰当地说是抓的不具体，特别是未能很好地贯彻到下面，其中县一级是个重要环节，因之我们曾屡次希望各地加强县以下的领导，从最近看来，若干地方已有显著进步，但仍希若干县区工作同志注意以下几点：
    第一是县的领导必须深入到村，深入到农民中去，依靠群众总结一些适合今天需要的典型经验，借以推动一般，以便有领导地去形成群众性的大生产运动。为此，就必须很好地发扬那些曾经在抗日战争中和人民解放战争中为群众所批准的好经验（如互助的自愿两利民主等价交换以及各种群众性的互助变工方法），继续运用到今天的生产运动中去。另一方面还要估计新的情况与条件来提出一些新的办法，譬如在华北完全解放条件下，应当进行城乡互助，如何充分运用城市力量来解决农业生产上过去所不能很好解决的困难，对于我们便是一个新鲜的问题。我们希望各级领导随时随地注意发掘问题，总结经验，克服各种困难，及时地去指导生产运动的进行，而不要用老一套的经验主义方法去领导生产，播种中的许多失败教训应引起我们警惕。
    第二是与当前生产要求结合，发动全体干部积极性，学习农业技术，学习使科学与农民经验相结合的方法，领导干部以身作则真正向农民学习，发扬他们的好的经验，同时还应争取城市技术力量的援助，学习科学技术，引导农民改进其某些落后的方面。这样，把推广技术，提高产量的工作，变成群众性的运动，而不要只把推广技术工作，限在一个小圈子内。
    第三是随时进行深入的检查工作，严密掌握农情，对于那种只注意统计，而不深入到群众中去领导群众生产的方法必须加以批评与纠正。在检查中，要注意对于领导群众生产有办法的干部与积极参加劳动的群众进行表扬与奖励。过去由于我们的领导工作不深入，县区到村只接近村干部和几个老的劳动英雄，而不深入到一般群众中去，因此，便曾发生为表扬而表扬的情形。有的不该表扬也受了表扬，而使表扬与奖励失去应有的作用。今年春季的生产运动中，我们未听到发现新的积极分子，未能形成一大规模的群众性的生产热潮，可能与此不无关系。
    目前正处于麦收、夏种、补种与锄苗错综复杂的繁忙紧张季节，而且虫害雹灾，时有发生，必须具体领导群众做顽强的斗争，才能克服困难保证农业生产任务达到完成。
