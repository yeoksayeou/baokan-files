Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, July 7th: A commentator, Melnikov, published an article in Labor News on the 5th in Moscow analyzing the so-called Bonn "Constitution," stating:

　　The primary purpose of fabricating the Bonn "Constitution" is to force the German people to accept federal institutions. This "Constitution" is not intended to establish a unified nation but rather twelve dwarf "states" entirely dependent on foreign countries. According to Article 32 of this "Constitution," the states even have the right to conclude treaties "independently" with foreign countries.

　　Although the Bonn "Constitution" stipulates that foreign affairs are under the jurisdiction of the "federal government," there is a reservation allowing the states to conclude treaties with foreign countries. Significant issues are managed by the state governments, with only a weak reservation that the federal government has the right to intervene and decide if an issue "exceeds the scope of a single state."

　　The true purpose of the "Constitution," to ultimately complete the dismemberment of Germany, is clearly seen in Article 24, which directly stipulates that the German "Federation" "will agree to limit its sovereignty." To end German sovereignty and subject West Germany to foreign rule – this is one of the main purposes of the Bonn "Constitution."

　　This "Constitution" directly helps reactionary forces restore their power. It does not restrict the ruling role of monopoly capital companies and Junker families – the agitators and organizers of German aggression. Although the Bonn "Constitution" provides measures to prevent the resurgence of fascism and militarism, it does not guarantee the people's basic democratic rights. Its articles do not guarantee the right to work, the right to a pension, etc., nor do they stipulate the right of the working people to strike.

　　The Bonn "Constitution" grants the president great power, which can easily be used to establish a new dictatorship, as happened before when these powers facilitated the establishment of the fascist dictatorship.

　　Thus, the Bonn "Constitution" is merely a "legal" smokescreen used to conceal the "occupation statutes," which Britain and the United States want to use to perpetuate the occupation regime in Germany and their dominance in Central Europe. Clearly, the Bonn "Constitution" is entirely detrimental to the unification of Germany. It only prolongs the occupation regime indefinitely and deepens the division of Germany. All this blatantly violates the international obligations that Western countries should bear.

　　German democratic forces are engaged in a resolute struggle against the policy of dividing the country, striving for national unity and a just peace. In the elections for the Third German People's Congress on May 15th and 16th, two-thirds of the voters voted in favor of German unification. Approximately eight million German working people voted for candidates nominated by parties and groups advocating a unified, democratic Germany.

　　This legitimate demand reflects the will of all democratic strata of the German people. At the same time, it conforms to the interests of peace and security for all nations.

　　评波恩“宪法”
      梅尔尼柯夫
    【新华社北平七日电】莫斯科讯：评论员梅尔尼柯夫五日在劳动报上著文分析所谓波恩“宪法”，内称：
    波恩“宪法”的焙制，其主要目的在于强使德国人民接受联邦机构。这个“宪法”不是要建立一个单一的国家，而是要建立十二个完全依赖外国的侏儒“国家”。按照该“宪法”第三十二条的规定，各州甚至有权“独立”与外国缔结条约。
    虽然波恩“宪法”规定外交属“联邦政府”管，但却有一项保留，即各州得与外国缔结条约。重大的问题都归州政府管，只作微弱的保留，若问题“超出一州范围”，联邦政府有权干预决定。
    “宪法”之真正目的在最后完成对德国的肢解，这一点清楚地见于该法第二十四条，该条直接规定，德国“联邦”“将同意限制其主权”。结束德国的主权，使西德受外国统治——这就是波恩“宪法”的主要目的之一。
    这个“宪法”直接帮助反动力量恢复他们的势力。它不限制独占资本公司和容克世家——这些德国侵略的鼓动者和组织者的统治作用。波恩“宪法”虽规定防止法西斯主义及军国主义再起的措施，但同时却不保障人民的基本民主权利，在它的条文里面，没有保障工作权，养老权等等。也没有规定劳动人民的罢工权。
    波恩“宪法”予总统以很大权力，可以容易地用来建立新的独裁，象以前曾经发生过的一样，当时这些权力就便利了法西斯独裁制的建立。
    这样，波恩“宪法”只是一种“法律的”烟幕，用来掩盖“占领法规”，而英美则想借助于这个“占领法规”，使对德占领制度和他们在中欧的统治地位永续不断。显然，波恩“宪法”是完全不利于德国的统一的，它只是无限期延长占领制度，加深德国的分裂。这一切都顾著地违反西方国家所应承担的国际义务。
    德国民主力量在从事坚决的斗争，反对分裂国家的政策，争取国家的统一和公正的和平。在五月十五及十六日第三届德国人民代表大会代表选举中，三分之二选民投票赞成德国统一。八百万左右德国劳动人民投票赞成主张统一民主德国的政党和团体所提出的候选人。
    这个正当要求反映德国人民一切民主阶层的意志。同时也符合于各国人民和平与安全的利益。
