Xinhua News Agency, Qingdao, 13th: Qingdao Zhongfang and Qilu Companies have partially resumed work. Qingdao Zhongfang's factories have a total of 350,000 spindles. Before liberation, due to the lack of raw materials and fuel, all factories except the machinery factory had been shut down for more than four weeks. After liberation, the company received a large amount of cotton and coal supplied by the Military Control Commission. As of the 10th, three textile factories and four factories (machinery, chemical, knitting, and winding) have simultaneously resumed work, with 140,000 spindles in operation. The remaining five textile factories and one dyeing factory will also be able to start work soon. Qilu Company, in addition to the brewery, which has never stopped work, Flour Factories 2 and 3 resumed work on the 8th. Other factories such as chemical, rubber, and vegetable oil have also partially resumed work.

Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, 13th: The Financial Department of the Qingdao Military Control Commission dispatched military representatives on the 2nd, summoning employees from the Qingdao branches of the puppet Central Bank, Bank of China, Bank of Communications, Farmers Bank, and Central Cooperative Treasury to announce the takeover. On the 3rd, it announced that the puppet Gold Yuan notes and silver dollar subsidiary notes issued by the Qingdao branch of the puppet Central Bank were illegal and authorized the Jiaodong Branch of the Beihai Bank (also handling the Qingdao branch of the People's Bank of China) to redeem them within five days. At the same time, it began redeeming gold, silver dollars, and foreign currencies at quoted prices. When the bank began redeeming on the 5th, citizens flocked to exchange them.

Another dispatch: Large quantities of grain, coal, cotton, and other materials from various parts of Shandong are being continuously transported to Qingdao. Trains on the Jinpu Railway, fully loaded with coal and cotton, departed from Jinan on the 7th and passed through the railway to Xinhai (i.e., Xinpu and Haizhou), and then shipped to Qingdao by sea. Hundreds of thousands of catties of grain are also departing from various parts of Jiaodong. Edible oils are being concentrated in Xuzhou, Dezhou, and other places, ready for shipment.

　　青岛中纺七个厂复工
  　开动纱锭十四万枚
  　大量粮煤棉源源运青
    【新华社青岛十三日电】青岛中纺与齐鲁两公司已部分复工。青岛中纺各厂共有纱锭三十五万枚，解放前因原料与燃料缺乏，除机械厂外，均停工四周有余。解放后该公司得到军管会供应的大宗棉花与煤炭，至十日止，已有三处纺织厂和机械、化工、针织、梳管四个厂同时复工，开动纱锭有十四万枚。其余的五个纺织厂和一个印染厂不久亦可开工。齐鲁公司除啤酒厂一直未停工外，面粉二、三两厂已于八日复工。其他如化学、橡胶、植物食油等厂也已部分复工。
    【新华社济南十三日电】青岛市军管会金融部于二日派出军事代表，召集青市伪中央银行、中国银行、交通银行、农民银行与中央合作金库的员工，宣布接管。并于三日宣布伪金圆券及伪中央银行青岛分行所发的银元辅币券非法，授权由北海银行胶东分行（兼理中国人民银行青岛分行）限期五天收兑，同时并按牌价开始收兑黄金、银元、外币等。当该行于五日开始收兑时，市民前往兑换者极踊跃。
    【又讯】山东各地大批粮、煤、棉花等物资正源源向青市输送。津浦路满载煤、棉的火车已于七日由济南开出，经铁路通至新海（即新浦与海州），再经海道运入青岛。数十万斤粮食亦正由胶东各地启程。食用油类则正在徐州、德州等地集中，准备启运。
