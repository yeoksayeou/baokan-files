Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, 2nd: The Tianjin Municipal Supply and Marketing Cooperative has recently sent personnel to establish contact with cooperatives in the Northeast, beginning a regular exchange of goods between inside and outside the Shanhaiguan Pass. The cooperative has already established a regular exchange relationship with the Northeast Cooperative General Office. The first batch of five thousand bolts of Tianjin-made cloth was shipped from Tianjin to the Northeast on the 28th of last month to exchange for grain, with the exchange locations tentatively set in Shenyang, Changchun, and Jilin. This move by the cooperative will greatly help to develop people's cooperative undertakings and eliminate the isolated management methods of the past. After this trade relationship is opened, mutually beneficial exchanges of goods will be carried out successively according to the needs of the vast number of cooperative members in both regions, so that the cooperative economies of the two regions can be further integrated and developed.

　　津中纺布五千匹运往东北换粮食
    【新华社天津二日电】天津市供销合作总社，近派员到东北各合作社建立联系，开始经常交流关内外物资。该社已与东北合作总社建立经常交换关系。首批五千匹中纺布匹已于上月二十八日由津运至东北交换粮食，交换地点暂定于沈阳、长春、吉林三地。该社此举，对开展人民合作事业，消灭以往各地孤立的经营方法有很大帮助。此种贸易关系打通后，今后将陆续根据两地广大社员的需要，进行互利的物资交换，使两地合作经济得到进一步的结合与发展。
