　　【Ping City News】Representatives from various places visiting the Ping Industrial Exhibition, including those from Central Hebei, Eastern Hebei, Hebei-Shandong-Henan, Chahar, Suiyuan-Mongolia, Zhangjiakou, Shijiazhuang, Tangshan, Jinzhou, Xuanhua, and Baoding, attended four panel discussions on trade, enterprises, industrial and commercial administration, and private industry and commerce on the 10th. They widely exchanged information on the restoration and development of production in various regions, as well as opinions on issues such as trade raw materials and sales channels. At the panel discussion on trade issues, Mayor Ye Jianying delivered an important speech. Mayor Ye first pointed out the importance of trade work in the current task of restoring and developing production. He said: Among the tasks of restoring and developing production, the central task is, of course, developing industry, which is the first priority; but in order to develop industry, we must develop agricultural production; only after agricultural production develops can we supply cities with raw materials and food, and only then can we increase purchasing power and develop markets. Here, the city must supply the countryside with means of production such as agricultural tools and fertilizers, which is the second priority. For the development of industry and agriculture, urban and rural areas must help each other, and industrial and agricultural economies can only be combined through commerce. If industry and agriculture have production but no sales channels, it will be fatal to industry and agriculture. Therefore, only by correctly guiding trade and developing trade to expand sales channels can we expand industry and agriculture and combine industry and agriculture, which is the third priority.

　　Mayor Ye pointed out: Today, in a series of tasks to restore and develop production, correctly guiding trade is a central link. Correctly guiding trade means that we must guide trade from the perspective of developing production and promoting the economy, and we cannot simply deal with it from the perspective of profit or finance. Cadres engaged in trade work must recognize their responsibilities, not regard trade work as purely business work, and not lower the position and role of trade work. Therefore, they must work hard to study Chairman Mao's economic policies and study commerce.

　　Secondly, Mayor Ye pointed out that in the past, due to the isolation of various liberated areas, they could not exchange with each other. Now that the whole of China is about to be liberated, we should organize a trade network and connect cities and villages through new and old clues. At the same time, in organizing trade, we should correctly develop trade by utilizing the capital, experience, and commercial relationships of private merchants. Under the principle of considering both public and private interests, we should provide correct guidance to private merchants, or adopt public-private joint ventures.

　　Finally, Mayor Ye raised the issue of Beijing's position in trade work. Economically, Beijing generally follows Tianjin. Beijing is generally a distribution center in trade. Today, on the one hand, we are concentrating our efforts on restoring and developing production, and on the other hand, we should correctly organize trade to turn Beijing into a link in the flow of urban and rural materials.

　　各地来平参观工展代表
  　座谈发展生产
  　叶市长强调恢复发展贸易
    【平市讯】来平参观工业展览的冀中、冀东、冀鲁豫、察哈尔、绥蒙、张家口、石家庄、唐山、锦州、宣化、保定等各地代表，十日分组出席贸易、企业、工商行政、私营工商业四个座谈会，广泛交换各地恢复发展生产情况及有关贸易原料、销路等各项问题的意见。在贸易问题的座谈会上，叶剑英市长曾作重要讲话。叶市长首先指出：目前在恢复和发展生产的任务中，贸易工作的重要性。他说：在恢复和发展生产的任务中，中心工作当然是发展工业，这是第一；但为了发展工业，必须发展农业生产；只有农业生产发展之后，才能供给城市以原料和粮食，才能提高购买力发展市场，在这里城市必须供给农村以农具、肥料等生产资料，这是第二：为了工业农业的发展，城乡必须互助，而工业农业经济，只有经过商业，才可结合起来。如果工农业有了生产而没销路，便是致工农业于死命。因此，只有正确的指导贸易，发展贸易，去扩展销路，才能扩张工农业，结合工农业，这是第三。
    叶市长指出：今天在恢复和发展生产的一系列工作中，正确指导贸易是一个中心环节。正确指导贸易就是必须从发展生产、繁荣经济的观点去指导贸易，而不能单纯从盈利或财政观点去处理。这样从事贸易工作的干部就必须认清自己的责任，不把贸易工作当作单纯的经商工作，不降低贸易工作的地位和作用，因此必须努力学习毛主席的经济政策，学习商业。
    其次，叶市长指出过去由于各解放区的被隔断，不能互相交流，现在全中国就要解放，应该组织贸易网，经过新的旧的线索，把城市与乡村联结起来。同时在组织贸易中，应该利用私商的资本、经验和商业关系等正确的发展贸易，在公私兼顾的原则下，对于私商要作正确指导，或采取公私合办。
    最后，叶市长提出关于北平在贸易工作中的地位问题。在经济上北平一般是依从天津的，北平在贸易上大体说来是一个集散地，今天我们一方面集中力量恢复和发展生产，一方面应该正确的组织贸易，把北平变成城乡物资流转中的纽带。
