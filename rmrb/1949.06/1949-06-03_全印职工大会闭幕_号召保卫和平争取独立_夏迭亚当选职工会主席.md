Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, June 1st.
    Bombay dispatch: The All India Trade Union Congress (AITUC) delegate conference held in Bombay closed on May 29th. The conference issued a document regarding the AITUC's work report for the two years since the last conference, which stated: The Indian government's suppression of the AITUC and its personnel has been proceeding in tandem with actions aimed at splitting the Indian labor movement. The enemies of the working class, reformists and socialist leaders are taking such splitting actions. Therefore, the fundamental task of the AITUC is to form a strong and unified front of the Indian working class to prevent such splits and to victoriously resist the capitalists' fierce attacks on the Indian working class. The AITUC is now struggling with unprecedented determination against the suppression carried out by the capitalist (Indian National Congress) government, which is unheard of in India; against the splitting actions of the reformist trade union Indian National Trade Union Congress (INTUC) and socialist leaders; and against politicians of the ilk of Milner-Ker-De-Volles and Suresh Bannerjee (leaders of the reformist trade union INTUC) who have infiltrated the labor movement. The AITUC is now the only fighting trade union organization of the Indian working class that is guiding workers in defending the rights of the working class and opposing the capitalists' intensified attacks. Despite the reactionaries' suppression and splitting policies against it, the AITUC remains the representative organization of the Indian working class.

    The report lists detailed materials regarding the extreme difficulties in the lives of the Indian working people and the increase in unemployment and the conditions of the unemployed. The number of unemployed industrial workers already registered at labor exchanges in various provinces of India has reached 1.5 million.

    Concurrent with the poverty and unemployment of Indian workers, Indian capitalists are pocketing huge profits. According to a communique from the Ministry of Industry, the profits of manufacturers in Bombay in 1948 reached 200 million rupees. This means that manufacturers extracted 972 rupees from each textile worker in Bombay. The report also pointed out that "immediately after the Indian government, employers, and reformist trade union leaders announced 'social peace in industry,' suppression was implemented against the unions affiliated with the AITUC."

    The AITUC report concluded by urging Indian workers to intensify the struggle for increased wages; for the right to work; for the abolition of anti-labor legislation; for the immediate release of all trade union leaders and other political prisoners; to defend peace and oppose Anglo-American warmongers; to fight for India's true independence; and to fight for the establishment of a people's democratic regime in India.

    The delegate conference passed 18 resolutions, including resolutions on the basic demands of the AITUC, the unemployment problem, trade union rights, on demanding that the government cease suppression and release arrested trade union leaders and other political prisoners, and on condemning the North Atlantic aggressive pact and the British Commonwealth Prime Ministers' conference's resolution on Indian issues, etc. The delegate conference expressed firm support for the resolutions of the World Peace Congress. The conference elected Bhatwadekar as the president of the AITUC. The former president of the AITUC, Dange, who is currently detained in prison, was elected as general secretary. The conference elected an executive committee composed of 120 members and a presidium composed of 27 members.

　　全印职工大会闭幕
  　号召保卫和平争取独立
  　夏迭亚当选职工会主席
    【新华社北平一日电】孟买讯：在孟买举行的全印职工大会代表大会于五月二十九日闭幕。大会发表了关于上届大会闭幕以后两年来全印职工大会工作报告的文件，其中说：印度政府对全印职工大会及其人员的镇压行动，是与旨在分裂印度职工运动的行动同时并进的。工人阶级的敌人，改良主义者和社会党领袖们，正在采取这种分裂行动。因此，全印职工大会的基本任务，就是组成印度工人阶级强有力的统一战线，来防止这种分裂，并胜利地抵抗资本家对印度工人阶级的猛烈进攻。全印职工大会正在以空前未有的毅力进行斗争以反对资本家（印度国大党人）政府所实施的在印度前所未闻的那种镇压行动，反对改良主义工会印度全国职工大会及社会党领袖的分裂行动，反对混进工人运动里来的密尔纳尔更迭伏斯和苏雷希班纳吉（改良主义工会印度全国职工大会的首领）之流的政客。全印职工大会现在是正在指导工人保卫工人阶级权利和反对资本家加紧进攻的印度工人阶级唯一的战斗的职工组织。尽管反动派对它采取镇压行动和分裂政策，但全印职工大会仍然是印度工人阶级的代表性的组织。
    报告中列举关于印度劳动人民生活无比困难与失业增加和失业者境况的详细材料。已经在印度各省劳工介绍所登记的失业产业工人已达一百五十万人。
    与印度工人的贫困失业同时，印度资本家却把巨大的利润装进自己的腰包里。根据工业部的公报，一九四八年孟买制造家的利润达二亿卢比。这就是说，制造家从孟买每个纺织工人身上取得了九百七十二个卢比。报告还指出，“在印度政府，雇主和改良主义工会领袖宣布‘工业中的社会安宁’之后，立即就对全印职工大会所属的各工会实施镇压。”
    全印职工大会报告在结语中敦促印度工人加紧为争取增加工资；争取工作权；争取废除反劳工立法；争取立即释放一切职工领袖及其他政治犯；保卫和平反对英美战争贩子；争取印度真正的独立；争取建立印度人民民主政权而斗争。
    代表大会通过了十八项决议，包括关于全印职工大会基本要求的决议、失业问题决议、工会权利问题决议、关于要求政府停止镇压行动和释放被捕的工会领袖及其他政治犯的决议、关于谴责北大西洋侵略公约和英联邦总理会议对印度问题决议等等。代表大会表示坚决拥护世界和平大会的决议。大会选出夏迭亚为全印职工大会主席。现被拘禁在监狱中的前任全印职工大会主席丹吉当选为总书记。大会选出由委员一百二十人组成的执行委员会由二十七人组成的主席团。
