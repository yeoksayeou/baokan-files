  　Episode 6: Water Heroes (Continued 1)
    The small steamboat was pointed at the front and flat at the back, seemingly made of canvas. Inside, there were wooden planks and iron supports, with a leather bottom. The boat floor was filled with blood, the corpses riddled with holes from iron shrapnel. The team happily collected the guns and bullets, throwing the corpses into the river with thuds. Xiao Shui looked at the steamboat and said, "Ha! How are we going to get this thing back?" Da Shui had heard that these small steamboats could be disassembled, so he told everyone to unscrew the bolts. Zhao Wu Geng found a pair of pliers and quickly took it apart. The engine was moved onto the small boat. Somehow, the boat shell was assembled; the team hurriedly lifted it onto the small boat. Once everything was settled, they happily rowed back.

    Da Shui shouted, "Let's row in formation, so the people can see how good we look!" His boat, carrying the green steamboat shell, was in the middle, flanked by nineteen small boats in a line. On each small boat, they rowed swiftly, one stroke up and one stroke down. For a moment, the middle boat moved especially fast, and the twenty boats formed a V-shape. The villagers of Shui Village, hearing that a steamboat had been captured, gathered on the shore to watch. A progressive gentleman, Mr. Liang Guangting (the newly elected county councilor), stroked his long white beard and said with a smile, "Ha, look! It's so beautiful, it's a Wild Goose Team!" The people all clapped and cheered, shouting, "Wild Goose Team! Wild Goose Team!" From then on, the name "Wild Goose Team" spread.
    
    IV

    Yang Xiaomei was the women's association director in the district, and the women's association worker was the beautiful Xiunu'er, formerly of the West Fishing Village women's association. As the Wild Goose Team prepared for their second attack on a steamboat, Xiunu'er pulled Xiaomei aside and said, "Let's go watch!" The two went to find Niu Da Shui. Da Shui laughed and said, "This is a battle, not a temple fair, what would you do there?" and didn't let them go. The two were rebuffed, and Xiunu'er discussed with Xiaomei, "Let's secretly sneak away, see where they go, and we'll take a small boat to pick water chestnuts and get a sneak peek!" They busied themselves preparing.
    
    At noon, the Wild Goose Team set off. This time, the reconnaissance reported that the enemy had twenty-some men in two large steamboats. Da Shui and the others found a better location, with reed marshes on both sides. The team split into two groups; Niu Da Shui's group was on the south side, preparing to attack the first steamboat, and Zhao Wu Geng's group was on the north side, preparing to attack the second steamboat, staggered apart. This time, they added a dozen or so "big blunderbusses" – good guns for hunting wild ducks, loaded with muffled powder, all arranged properly.
    
    The reed leaves rustled. A fragrant scent wafted over with the breeze. It turned out that a large expanse of lotus flowers had bloomed on the east side of the reed marsh; looking out, thousands upon thousands swayed in the wind... Suddenly, they saw two women, one in front of the other, rowing a small boat, and they disappeared into the lotus bushes on the north side. It looked like Xiunu'er and Yang Xiaomei. Da Shui said, "It must be those two silly things, we told them not to come, but they came anyway!" He quickly rowed a small boat to drive them away.
    
    They hid inside without making a sound. Da Shui got anxious and threatened them, "Which women are causing trouble here! If you don't leave, we'll shoot!" Xiunu'er poked her head out and said, "We're picking water chestnuts, what's it to you?" Da Shui pointed at her and said, "You mischievous brat! This is not a game! If you don't leave, we'll criticize you when we get back!" Xiunu'er laughed and said, "Alright, alright, we're leaving!" and disappeared.
    
    The team members rowed over. Da Shui said angrily, "What are you doing here? Hurry back and hide!" Niu Xiaoshui said with a cheeky grin, "Reporting, Captain! It's still early in the day; let me take a swim!" Da Shui said with a stern face, "Are you here to fight or to play?" Zhao Wu Geng said with a smile, "Captain, the steamboats just passed, they won't be back yet! It's so hot, let us take a swim!" Seeing that Da Shui no longer objected, Xiao Shui plunged into the water. Everyone else stripped to the waist, wearing only their shorts, and jumped in. Da Shui was the only one left, wanting to swim but feeling inappropriate, so he picked a lotus leaf to fan himself, gazing far to the west.
    
    Xiao Shui splashed around a few times, popped his head out of the water, wiped his face with his hand, and shouted, "Let's have a race! See who swims the fastest!" He paddled on his back, splashing and swimming away. Many people chased him, some floating flat, some swimming sideways with their heads tilted; the skinny Zhao Wu Geng was at the very back, like a toad, bending and stretching his legs, darting to the very front. The rest of the people, watching their race, clapped, laughed and shouted. Da Shui turned his head and saw Xiunu'er and Yang Xiaomei poking their heads out from the lotus bushes, secretly watching. Da Shui called to Xiaomei, "Why haven't you left yet? If you stay here, it'll be dangerous when the enemy comes. Hurry up and leave!" Xiaomei laughed in agreement, and she and Xiunu'er rowed away.
    
    Fearing that it would interfere with the mission, Da Shui quickly called everyone back. Dozens of small boats disappeared into the reed marsh again. After a while, the surface of the water was quiet; two "mallards" emerged from the water, straightened up, flapped their gray wings, and called out happily, a tuft of hair on their heads, green and sparkling.

    V
    
    Everyone waited a long time, but the steamboats didn't come. The weather changed. Dark clouds gathered in the distance, covering half the sky. The wind howled, and the reeds all bent to one side. Everyone said anxiously, "Damn it! If it rains, the gunpowder will get wet, and we won't be able to fight!" Some said, "The steamboats probably won't come back, let's go!" Da Shui said, "Don't rush! Let's wait and see." Before he could finish speaking, they heard a clattering sound, like the steamboats were coming. Da Shui hurriedly shouted, "Get ready!" And he ordered the other group to hide and be sentries. The team members hurriedly struck matches to light incense, but the wind was strong, and they went out as soon as they were lit. Several people huddled together and made a great effort to light the incense. The sound grew closer and closer, and sure enough, the steamboats were coming.
    
    At this moment, the wind grew stronger, bringing raindrops. The team members hurriedly took off their clothes to cover the incense sticks, fuses, and gun barrels; some used straw hats to cover them. They saw two yellow steamboats coming, the rear cabin covered with a green canvas awning, with many Japanese soldiers huddled under the awning. The first steamboat was towing a civilian boat, loaded with many goods, with a basket hanging from the top of the tall mast, and a Japanese soldier sitting in the basket, looking ahead with binoculars.
    
    In an instant, the first steamboat was approaching Da Shui's group, and the second steamboat was approaching Zhao Wu Geng's group. Da Shui saw that the lookout on top of the mast—the "monkey"—was looking far away, so he secretly aimed his gun at him. The "monkey" lowered his head, suddenly noticed someone in the reeds aiming a gun at him, and was so frightened that he grabbed the mast and stood up. Before he could shout, Da Shui shot him in the lower abdomen, and the "monkey" fell backward, feet up, from above.
    
    Immediately following were two thunderous explosions, and the smoke and clouds turned black. They heard the second steamboat crash into the southern reed marsh and go silent. The first steamboat was still chugging, and the machine gun kept firing this way. Da Shui and his team were on the edge of the reed marsh, not expecting the enemy to have a machine gun. The machine gun bullets densely shot into the reeds, some hitting the boats. Everyone panicked and fled in confusion, dragging their guns into the water, running and swimming, diving into the depths of the reeds. Zhao Wu Geng's group fired a volley of shots, and their small boats also entered the trenches and turned away.
    
    The wind blew away the black smoke, and the raindrops also passed. Thunder rumbled in the distance. The steamboat fired another burst of machine gun fire and then opened the side reed marsh, discovering many small boats, all with very long guns tied to them. The Japanese had never seen guns like this before and thought they were remarkable, speaking in Japanese and taking all the muskets onto the steamboat.
    
    Xiaomei and Xiunu'er hid far away in the lotus bushes, and they didn't hear any movement for a long time. Xiunu'er said, "They must have eliminated the Japanese devils, let's go take a look!" Xiaomei said, "Don't! There was a burst of machine gun fire just now, we don't know what happened!" Xiunu'er said, "Let's not get close, let's take a peek and see what happened!" The two were very anxious and quietly rowed out, looking from afar. They didn't expect to be discovered by the enemy.
    
    The Japanese soldiers shouted, and the steamboat chased over, scaring the two of them pale. They turned the boat around and desperately rowed the small boat, diving under the lotus leaves. Suddenly, a shot rang out, the machine gunner on the steamboat fell, followed by a volley of shots, the Japanese soldiers were all shot dead in the boat, and two wounded soldiers panicked and jumped into the water and drowned. It turned out that Niu Da Shui and his group had circled around from the reed marsh and secretly hid in a large lotus patch in the south, each with a large lotus leaf on their head, with most of their bodies submerged in the water, calling themselves the "Lotus Leaf Army", ambushing together; when the enemy's steamboat came over, they fired a direct hit. At the same time, a dozen or so small boats flashed out from the reed marsh, it was Zhao Wu Geng's group, charging towards the steamboat. The steamboat rushed blindly past, running a bow's length in the lotus bushes and getting stuck...
    
    The wind howled, and it started to rain again, heavier and heavier. Thunder rumbled. The storm quickly pressed the reeds into the water. Raindrops hit the lotus leaves, swirling like beads. The calm water surface rippled. The sky and water merged, a hazy expanse. The guerrillas hurriedly collected the spoils of war and smashed the steamboat. Xiaomei and Xiunu'er were also soaked, happily helping.
    
    It was getting dark. Dozens of small boats and one big boat returned against the wind and rain, advancing up and down on the waves. In the darkness, no one could see anyone else, only the sound of wind and rain, and the sound of rowing, roaring, clashing, mixed with people's loud shouts. A flash of lightning, and a thunderclap struck down heavily, overwhelming all sounds, making people tremble. The darkness all around was even more intense. Da Shui roared, "Yang Xiaomei! Keep close! If you fall behind, you'll get lost!" Xiaomei replied loudly from behind, "We're following! We won't get lost!" The wind blew away the last half of her sentence. Another fiercer thunder struck head-on...

    Da Shui, Xiaomei and the others returned victoriously in the storm.

  　第六回　水上英雄　（续一）
    那小汽船，前头尖，后边齐；看起来是帆布做的。里面可有木板，用铁棍支的架子，还有牛皮底儿。船底里流了好些血，死人身上叫铁沙子打得一片一片的，全是窟窿眼儿。大家快活的敛了枪和子弹，把死尸都咕咚咕咚的扔到河里。小水看着汽船说：“哈！这玩艺儿可怎么弄回去呀？”大水听说过，这号小汽船可以卸开来，就叫大家拧螺丝钉。赵五更找到一把钳子，一下子都拆开了。机器搬到小船上。船壳儿不知怎么一来，合起了；大伙儿七手八脚的把它抬上小船。弄停当，才欢天喜地的划回来。
    大水喊着：“咱们走齐喽，叫老百姓瞧着好看！”他船上载着绿茵茵的船壳儿，走在当间，两边一字儿摆开十九条小船，每个小船的两旁，一上一下的打着棹，飞快的划回来。一时，中间的小船走得特别快，二十条小船走成个人字形了。水村里的老百姓，听说打了汽船，都聚在岸上看。有个开明绅士梁广庭老先生，（他是新选上的县参议员），捋着长长的白胡子，笑呵呵的指着说：“哈，你们瞧！真好看，这是个雁翎队啊！”老百姓都拍手叫好，喊着：“雁翎队！雁翎队！”从此，雁翎队的名儿，就传开了。
    四
    杨小梅在区上当妇会主任，妇会的干事就是以前西渔村妇会的秀女儿。雁翎队第二次准备打汽船，秀女儿拉着小梅说：“咱们也跟得去瞧瞧！”两个去找牛大水。大水笑着说：“这是打仗，又不是赶庙会，你们去干吗呀？”就不让她们去。她俩碰了个钉子回来，秀女儿跟小梅商量：“咱们偷偷儿瞒着他们，看他们上哪儿，咱俩划个小船去摘菱角，暗暗的瞧个希罕！”就忙着准备起来。
    晌午，雁翎队出发了。这一次，侦察来的消息，说敌人有二十几个，坐的两只大汽船，过去了。大水他们找了个更好的地点，两边都是苇塘。队伍分成两拨子；牛大水一拨在南边，准备打第一只汽船，赵五更一拨在北边，准备打第二只汽船，两拨子错开。这回添了十几支“大抬杆儿”——都是打野鸭用的好枪，装了闷药，一齐布置好。
    苇叶子唰唰唰的响。风吹过来一阵阵清香味儿。原来是苇塘东边，南北两大片荷花都开了；望过去，千朵万朵，在风里摇摆……忽然瞧见有两个妇女，一前一后的划着个小船儿过来，钻到北边的荷花丛里去了。看着就象是秀女儿和杨小梅。大水说：“准是她两个傻东西，叫她们别来，她们偏来了！”连忙划着个小船去赶她们。
    她们藏在里面不作声。大水急了，吓唬她们说：“哪儿的娘们，来这儿捣乱！不走咱开枪啦！”秀女儿钻出头儿来说：“我们摘菱角，碍你什么事儿？”大水指着她说：“你这个调皮鬼！这是闹着玩儿的啊？再不走，回去非斗你们不行！”秀女儿笑着说：“行行行，我们走呀！”就不见了。
    队员们划着小船过来看。大水生气说：“你们来干吗？快回去隐蔽起来！”牛小水嘻皮笑脸的说：“报告队长！日头老高的，还早呢；让我洗个澡吧！”大水绷着脸儿说：“你是来打仗，还是来玩儿呀？”赵五更笑着说：“队长，汽船刚过去不多会儿，且不来呢！天这么热，就让我们洗个澡吧！”小水看大水不再反对，就扑通跳下水去了。大家光着脊梁，穿个裤衩儿，都跳了下去。剩下大水一个，也想洗澡，又觉得不好，摘个荷叶扇着凉儿，向远远的西边了望着。
    小水打了几个扑腾，从水里钻出头来，用手在脸上抹了一把，喊：“咱们比赛！看谁游得快！”他仰八脚儿打水，哗哗哗的游去。好些个人追他，有的平凫，有的歪着脑袋，侧棱子凫；瘦骨嶙嶙的赵五更在顶后面，象个蛤蟆似的，两腿一曲一伸，直窜到顶前面去了。剩下的那些人，看他们比赛，都拍着手儿，又笑又叫。大水一扭头，瞧见荷花丛里秀女儿和杨小梅伸出头儿，偷偷的瞧呢。大水喊小梅：“你们怎么还没有走呀？老待在这儿，回头敌人来了，可危险啊。快走吧！”小梅笑着答应，和秀女儿划船走了。
    大水怕误了事儿，忙把人都叫回来。几十只小船又钻进苇塘里。一会儿，水面上静悄悄的；两只“绿头公”从水里钻出来，直起身子拍着灰翅膀，快活的叫了两声，头上一撮毛儿，绿得冒金星。
    五
    大家等了很久，汽船还不来。天变了。黑云远远的拥过来，遮满了半个天空。风呼呼呼的刮着，苇子都往一边弯。大家着急的说：“糟了！一下雨，火药淋湿了，就打不成啦！”有的说：“汽船怕不回去了，咱们走吧！”大水说：“别忙！咱们再等等看吧。”一句话没说完，就听见喀哒喀哒的响声，象是汽船过来了。大水忙叫：“快准备！”又给斜对面一拨子打暗哨儿。队员们急忙擦洋火点香，风很大，一擦着就灭了。几个人碰成堆，费了很大的劲儿，才把香点着。响声越来越近，果然是汽船来了。
    这当儿，风更大了，打着雨点儿。队员们忙脱下衣裳，把香头、火捻、枪膛都盖起来；有的用草帽罩住。眼看两只黄虎虎的大汽船过来了，船后舱搭着绿帆布的顶棚儿，好些个鬼子挤在棚底下。那第一只汽船还拖着个民船，上面载了许多货，高高的桅杆顶上吊着个筐儿，筐儿里面坐着个鬼子，正在拿望远镜向前面了望呢。
    一刹时，第一只汽船快到大水这一拨的眼前，第二只汽船也快到赵五更那一拨的跟前了。大水看见那桅杆顶上的了望哨——“猴儿”尽朝远处望，就偷偷的用枪瞄准他，那“猴儿”一低头，忽然发现苇丛里有人拿枪瞄着他，吓得抱着桅杆立起来。大水不等他喊叫，一枪打中他的小肚子，“猴儿”向后一仰，就两脚朝天的从上面摔了下来。
    接连着两声霹雳似的轰响，烟和云黑成了一片。听得见第二只汽船撞到南边苇塘里，不响了。第一只汽船可还咕咚咕咚的响着，机关枪一个劲儿往这边扫射。大水他们都在苇塘的边上，没想到敌人有机枪，那机枪子儿密密的射进苇丛，有的就打在船上。大家慌了，纷纷乱乱的，拖着大枪往水里跳，连跑带游，向苇丛的深处钻。赵五更那一拨打了一排枪，小船儿也都钻了濠，转走了。
    风把黑烟刮跑，雨点儿也过去了。雷在远处闷沉沉的响。那汽船又打了一阵机枪，就开到这边苇塘来，发现了许多小船，船上都绑着很长很长的枪。日本人没见过这号枪，觉得很了不起，嘀哩嘟噜的说着话儿，把土枪都弄到汽船上去了。
    小梅她俩远远的藏在荷叶丛里，半天听不见动静了。秀女儿说：“准把鬼子消灭啦，咱们去瞧瞧吧！”小梅说：“别！刚才打了一阵子机枪，还不知道怎么个呢！”秀女儿说：“咱们别走近，偷着望望，看是怎么了！”两个人心里怪着急的，悄悄儿划出来，远远的望呢。不想就给敌人发现了。
    鬼子们喊着，汽船喀哒喀哒追过来，吓得她两个脸色都变了，掉转船头，拼命划着那小船，往荷叶下面钻。突然一声枪响，汽船上的机枪手倒下了，紧接着一阵排子枪，鬼子都打死在船里，有两个打伤的，着慌跳了水，也给淹死了。原来牛大水一伙从苇塘里绕过来，偷偷儿藏在南边一大片荷花丛里，每人头上顶着大荷叶，多半个身子浸在水里，说是“荷叶军”，一齐埋伏着；敌人的汽船过来，刚好打了个准。同时，苇塘里也闪出来十几条小船，是赵五更那一拨，朝汽船冲来。汽船瞎闯过去，在荷花丛里跑了一弓远，搁住了……
    风吼着，雨又下起来，越下越大。雷，隆隆隆的滚过。急风暴雨把苇子都快按到水里了。雨点儿打在荷叶上，象珠子一样乱转。平静的水面，起了波浪。天连水，水连天，迷迷蒙蒙一大片。游击队匆匆忙忙收了胜利品，砸毁汽船。小梅秀女儿也淋得浑身是水，快活的帮忙。
    天黑了。几十只小船和一只大船顶风冒雨回来。在波浪上忽上忽下的前进。黑暗里，人们谁也看不见谁，只听见风卷雨扑，和打棹的声音，哗啦啦、哗啦啦的响成一片，夹着人们高声的呼喊。电光一闪，一个霹雳重重的打下来，压倒了一切声音，震得人发颤。四下里黑得更厉害了。大水吼着：“杨小梅！快跟紧啊！一掉队就失迷啦！”小梅在后面高声应着：“我们跟着呢！丢不了！”她的后半句话，给风吹得听不见。更猛的雷，又劈面打过来……
　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　（未完）（附图片）
    大水小梅他们在暴风雨中胜利归来。
