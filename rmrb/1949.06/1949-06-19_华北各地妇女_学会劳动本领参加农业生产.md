　　Women in North China
  　Learn Labor Skills to Participate in Agricultural Production
    [Report from this newspaper] Women in various parts of North China are actively participating in large-scale agricultural production, learning various labor skills, and their social and family status is generally improving. Due to the different labor habits and work foundations of women in various regions, development has been different: 1. In areas with a tradition of labor and attention to mobilization, almost all women have participated in agricultural labor, and most have become full laborers. In Xinle County, 90% of women participated in field labor. In Pingshan, Huolu, and other areas, young women pushing wheelbarrows, carrying water, and doing field work are almost on par with men. The Pingshan Women's Federation is launching a "Five Skills" campaign to learn plowing, planting, weeding, pushing carts, and driving vehicles. Because most women actively participate in major labor, it has ensured that each mu of paddy field in the county is fertilized with 80 to 100 small carts of fertilizer, and most of the dry land has been sown. 2. In old areas with relatively poor labor habits but a good work foundation, 40% to 80% of women participated in agricultural labor and are gradually being organized. Among the 2,492 female laborers in the Sixth District of Pingshun, 753 have directly participated in plowing, weeding wheat, delivering manure, reclaiming wasteland, sowing seeds, and accumulating fertilizer. 3. In old areas with a poor work foundation and new areas where women do not have labor habits, women's participation in production is gradually being mobilized, and in some places it has reached about 30% to 50%. Women in Jinzhong, who are not accustomed to field labor, have raised their awareness after the land reform and used various methods to dispel family concerns and misunderstandings about women going to work in the fields, and women have participated in labor one after another. Among the 8,670 women in 49 villages in Fenyang, 4,458 participated in spring plowing, and more than 100 women in Yanchu Village also participated in the work of repairing canals and carrying earth.
    The following are some preliminary experiences in mobilizing women to participate in production this year: 1. In new areas, emphasis should be placed on propaganda and enlightenment to dispel concerns, starting with light work and not being impatient; 2. First, organize women who lack male labor to take the lead in labor, and promote it to the general public; 3. There is no need for separate women's mutual aid teams, and take care of women's housework, pay attention to solving their special difficulties, and appropriately adjust their working hours and types of labor.

　　华北各地妇女
  　学会劳动本领参加农业生产
    【本报讯】华北各地妇女积极参加农业大生产，学会各种劳动本领，社会地位与家庭地位普遍提高。由于各地区妇女劳动习惯及工作基础的不同而有不同的开展：一、在素有劳动习惯且注意发动的地区，妇女差不多全数参加了农业劳动，并有大部变成了全劳力。新乐全县百分之九十的妇女参加了田间劳动。平山、获鹿一带，青年妇女推小车、担水、做地里活，差不多赶上了男子。平山妇联会正发起学会耕、种、锄、推车、赶车的“五会”运动。由于大部妇女积极参加主要劳动，保证了该县水地每亩施肥八十至一百小车，并大部完成了旱地的播种。二、劳动习惯较差但工作基础较好的老区，百分之四十至八十的妇女参加了农业劳动，并逐渐组织起来。平顺六区二千四百九十二个女劳力中，已有七百五十三个直接参加犁地、锄麦、送粪、开荒、下种、积肥等劳动。三、工作基础较差的老区与妇女没有劳动习惯的新区，妇女参加生产在逐渐发动，有的地方亦达百分之三十至五十左右。素不习惯田间劳动的晋中妇女，在土改后觉悟提高的基础上，用各种办法解除了家庭对妇女下地干活的顾虑与误解，妇女纷纷参加劳动。汾阳四十九个村八千六百七十个妇女中，参加春耕的有四千四百五十八人，演武村百余妇女还参加了修渠抬土工作。
    今年各地发动妇女参加生产中，有以下初步经验：一、新区应着重宣传启发，解除顾虑，从轻活逐渐作起，不能性急；二、首先组织缺乏男劳力的妇女带头劳动，推动一般；三、不必单独妇女互助，并照顾妇女家里活，注意解决其特殊困难，适当调剂其劳动时间与种类。
