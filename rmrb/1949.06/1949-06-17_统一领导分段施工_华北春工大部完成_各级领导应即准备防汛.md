Unified Leadership, Segmented Construction
　　Most of North China's Spring Works Completed
　　Leaders at All Levels Should Immediately Prepare for Flood Prevention
    [Comprehensive Dispatch from This Newspaper] Since the start of the North China region's river management projects last winter and this spring, most or all of them have been completed. The areas where work is not yet finished are being expedited, striving for completion before the major flood season. Completed areas are actively inspecting dikes, verifying risks, preparing materials, and establishing flood prevention organizations. Under the leadership of the People's Government for several consecutive years, North China has made great efforts in river management and flood prevention. However, due to repeated sabotage by Kuomintang bandits, some dikes have not been well repaired. Furthermore, complacency and negligence in defense in certain areas led to the inundation of over 11 million mu of farmland last year due to breaches, causing enormous losses. This should be brought to the serious attention of all localities. According to reports from various places, the following preliminary experiences have been gained in this year's river management work: First, unified leadership and segmented implementation. Governments above the county level must establish water conservancy departments, and water conservancy committees should also be established at the district and village levels, closely connecting upstream and downstream areas to ensure consideration of both; projects are carried out in segments by district and village, each with specific responsibilities, which not only enhances the enthusiasm of the masses but also avoids waste of manpower and resources. Second, conduct accurate surveys before and after construction. This not only saves financial expenditure but also ensures the improvement of project quality. According to statistics from five counties in the Jizhong South Canal project, the amount of earthwork used was reduced by 60% compared to the original estimate due to accurate surveying. The Hutuo and Zhulong River projects also saved more than 390,000 jin of rice compared to the original budget. Third, adopt the contract system. In the Jiluyu Yellow River project, changing from conscripted labor to contracted labor increased labor efficiency by one to two times. Xinle adopted the methods of large contracts, small contracts, and rice subsidies, saving more than 3,600 workdays compared to mobilizing civilians in the past. Fourth, combine work relief, integrating river management with disaster relief. In the Taihang area, 3.3 million jin of grain were used for work relief, turning 600,000 mu of waterlogged land into fertile fields. Among the 90,000 civilian workers in the Hutuo and Zhulong River projects in Jizhong, there were more than 30,000 disaster-stricken labor teams, receiving more than 220,000 jin of grain. This year, the government is allocating grain for river management, mainly for larger river defense projects. General projects should rely on the strength of the masses, mobilizing self-repair. For example, in the river management of the Jianping Special District in Chahar Province, the government only allocated 170,000 jin of rice, with most expenses being raised by the local masses themselves.
    In areas where spring works have been completed, preparations for flood prevention should be made as early as possible in accordance with the instructions of the North China People's Government. The Jiluyu Yellow River Committee convened a meeting at the beginning of the month, reviewing the defensive biases of 1947, which focused on the entire line while neglecting key points, and 1948, which focused on key points while neglecting the entire line. A flood prevention plan for this year was formulated. The Jidong Administrative Office instructed in mid-May that the entire region should prevent water disasters and earnestly implement the project verification system. The Jinnan Fourth Prefectural Committee deployed flood prevention work at the expanded county party committee joint meeting at the end of last month, especially pointing out that drought resistance must be accompanied by flood prevention. However, according to reports, many areas where spring works have been completed are content with the masses saying "We can rest assured now, we are no longer afraid of flooding!" etc., seemingly without the need to continue flood prevention, which is alarming. Leaders at all levels should immediately take necessary measures to intensify preparations for flood prevention and strictly guard against complacency and negligence.

### 统一领导分段施工　华北春工大部完成　各级领导应即准备防汛

　　统一领导分段施工
  　华北春工大部完成
  　各级领导应即准备防汛
    【本报综合讯】华北全区治河工程，自去冬今春先后施工以来，已大部或全部完成，未完工地区正加紧进行，争取于大汛前完成，已竣工者正积极进行查堤验险，准备工料及建立防汛组织等工作。连年在人民政府领导下，华北各地对治河防汛工作曾作很大努力，但因屡受国民党匪帮破坏，以致某些堤防未能很好修整，再加某些地区麻痹大意，疏于防守，使去年全区因决口而淹耕地一千一百余万亩，造成巨大损失。应引起各地严重注意。据各地报导，今年治河工作已获以下初步经验：第一是统一领导，分段进行。县以上政府须设水利部门，区村亦应成立水利委员会，密切上下游联系作到上下游兼顾；工程按区村分段进行，各有专责，不仅能够提高群众积极性，又可避免人力物力浪费。第二是施工前后进行精确测量。不仅能够节省财政开支，还可确保工程质量的提高。冀中南运河工程，据五个县的统计，因勘测精确，所用土方即比原估数减少百分之六十。滹沱、潴龙二河工程亦较原预算节米三十九万余斤。第三是采用包工制。冀鲁豫黄河工程，改征工为包工，劳动效率提高一倍至二倍。新乐采用大包工、小包工及补助米的办法，比过去动员民夫省工三千六百余个。第四是以工代赈，使治河与救灾结合。太行区用三百三十万斤粮食以工代赈，使六十万亩涝地成为良田。冀中滹沱、潴龙二河九万余民工中，有灾民包工队三万余人，得粮二十二万余斤。今年政府拨粮治河，主要是对较大的河防工程，一般工程应依靠群众力量，发动自修，如察省建屏专区治河中，政府只拨米十七万斤，大部费用由当地群众自行筹措。
    在春工已竣地区，按照华北人民政府的指示，应及早准备防汛。冀鲁豫黄委会月初召集会议，检讨了一九四七年的注意全线而忽略重点以及一九四八年注意重点而忽略全线的防守偏向。制订今年防汛计划。冀东行署上月中旬指示，全区预防水患，切实执行验工制度。冀南四地委于上月底扩大县委联席会上，布置防泛工作，特别指出抗旱必须同时防水。但据报导，不少春工完工地区则多满足于群众说“这可放心了，再也不怕水淹了！”等等，似无继续防汛之必要，实堪警惕，各级领导上应即采取必要措施加紧准备防汛，严防麻痹大意的现象发生。
