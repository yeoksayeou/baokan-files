    Hebei-Shandong-Henan Telegram: The flood season of the Yellow River is approaching (July 7th to the first frost is the Yellow River's major flood season). In order to integrate with production and prepare for flood control, the Yellow River Committee held a flood control meeting at the beginning of the month. Accepting the past two years of flood control experience, it formulated this year's flood control plan. This year's flood control work is under new peaceful circumstances. Therefore, the general principle for this year is determined to be "equal emphasis on repair and defense, no breaches allowed." Focus on defending key points along the entire line, strengthen embankment protection organizations, establish clear intelligence, and achieve timely repairs, defenses, and rescues, which can both prevent paralysis and save manpower and materials. At the same time, different methods are adopted according to the different conditions of each section of the Yellow River. In areas with a good flood control foundation, strengthen the organization of command points, and establish two long-term flood control personnel who do not change shifts. In areas with a considerable flood control foundation, strengthen the leadership organization of flood control command points, with a long-term flood control personnel every three *li*. The task of the flood control command point is to lead the village's embankment protection and flood control organization, guard, repair, and rescue the dam at all times. In areas where the river water frequently approaches the embankment and there are many dangerous works, it is stipulated that there should be one flood control personnel every *li*. In newly recovered areas with wide beaches, high risk, and unstable social order, it is decided to set up one flood control personnel every two *li*. In terms of organizational leadership, counties and districts all set up flood control headquarters. Before the flood season, all levels of leadership organizations must be established, flood control equipment must be fully prepared, and sufficient publicity, education and training must be conducted among the masses. Before the major flood season, conduct a comprehensive inspection to avoid insufficient preparation. It calls on everyone to carry forward the spirit of diligence, hard work, and heroic struggle in the past to ensure the completion of this great task.
    Hebei-Shandong-Henan Telegram: In order to fully grasp the changes in the Yellow River, the Yellow River Committee organized a surveying team. Since the Yellow River changed its course in 1938, the embankment line and river channel have undergone great changes due to years of sediment filling and damage. It is necessary to systematically understand the current height of the south bank's Yellow River embankment to determine how much flow it can withstand, and how the river channel has changed. For this reason, the Yellow River Committee specially organized eleven surveying cadres and more than twenty surveyors, divided into three surveying groups, and set off separately on May 20th. It is estimated that all engineering surveys can be completed in early July.

    冀鲁豫黄委会制定防汛计划
    修防并重不准溃决
    【冀鲁豫电】黄河汛期即将到来（七月七日至霜降为黄河大汛期），为结合生产，做好防汛准备工作，黄委会特于月初召开防汛会议，接受已往二年防汛经验，制定本年度防汛计划。今年防汛工作，是处在新的和平的情况下；故确定今年的总方针，为“修守并重，不准溃决”。掌握重点防守全线，强化护堤组织，建立灵通情报，做到及时修补防守及抢救，既可防止麻痹，又可节省人力物力。同时根据黄河各段不同情况，采取不同办法。在防汛基础好的地区，加强指挥点的组织，设两个长期不换班的防汛员，有相当防汛基础的地区，以加强防汛指挥点的领导组织，每三里设一长期防汛员。防汛指挥点的任务是领导村的护堤防汛组织，逐时守护、修补、抢救大堤等工作。在河水经常靠堤，险工较多地方规定每一华里一个防汛员，在滩面宽，危险性大，社会秩序尚不够稳定的新收复区，决定每二华里设一防汛员。组织领导方面，县、区均设防汛指挥部。在入汛期前各级领导机构均须成立起来，防汛器材准备齐全，并对群众进行充分的宣传教育和训练。在大汛期前，普遍大检查一次，以免准备不足。号召大家必须发扬过去兢兢业业，不怕艰苦困难英勇奋斗的精神，保证完成这一伟大任务。
    【冀鲁豫电】为充分掌握黄河变化情况，黄委会组织测量队。按黄河自民国二十七年改道后，堤线、河身经过历年的沙土填垫及破坏，发生了很大变化，对南岸临黄堤现在的高度究竟能挡多大流量、河身变化如何等等问题，均需作系统了解。为此黄委会特组织测量干部十一人，测工二十余人，分为三个测量组，于五月二十日分头出发预计全部工程测量于七月上旬即可完成。
