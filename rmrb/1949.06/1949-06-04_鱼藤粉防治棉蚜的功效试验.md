　　Efficacy Test of Derris Powder for Controlling Cotton Aphids
　　Zhu Hongfu
　　Derris powder is a yellowish-brown powder ground from derris root. Derris root is one of the three major botanical insecticides, produced in tropical and subtropical Asia, such as the South Seas Islands and Taiwan. Its main effective ingredient is rotenone. As an insecticide, it acts as both a stomach poison and a contact poison. It is extremely toxic to fish, 10 to 15 times more toxic to aphids than nicotine, and six times more toxic to flies than pyrethrum. It does not harm plants, humans, or livestock, making it an effective and widespread insecticide in China.
　　This experiment focuses on "comparing the growth, yield, and quality of cotton plants affected by aphids after the application of derris powder with those of untreated plants." Therefore, the only differentiating factor is the application of the insecticide. The cotton field is located within the Wansheng Garden in the western suburbs of Beiping, divided into sixteen equally sized cotton areas. The cotton varieties are Sizi Cotton 4B and 2B, each occupying eight cotton areas. Derris powder was applied to four areas of each variety, while the other four areas were left untreated. Sowing took place on April 14, 1948, with two fertilizer applications and two insecticide applications in between. Weeding was diligent, and there were no weeds in the cotton field.
　　The results of the experiment showed that cotton plants treated with derris powder grew rapidly and developed vigorously. After the first application (early June), the mortality rate of aphids was 89.5%. After the second application (mid-June), the mortality rate of aphids was 73.6%. After the third application (early July), the mortality rate was 73.1%. The total harvest per mu (approx. 0.16 acres) increased by 100-200 jin (approx. 110-220 lbs) of seed cotton after application. Furthermore, the following results can be seen from the total yield of the areas.
　　(1) The seed cotton yield of Sizi Cotton 4B after application was more than one and a half times higher than that of the untreated plants, while the yield of Sizi 2B was about twice as high.
　　(2) The total yield of Sizi 4B cotton after application was lower than that of Sizi 2B cotton after application, with a difference of about 25 shi jin (approx. 27.5 lbs) per mu. The yield of untreated 4B cotton was higher than that of untreated 2B cotton, with a difference of about 50 shi jin (approx. 55 lbs) per mu.
　　(3) Sizi 2B cotton is more sensitive to aphid infestation than Sizi No. 4.
　　The impact of aphid infestation on cotton plant growth and the growth after treatment are detailed below:
　　(1) Impact of aphid infestation on cotton plant height: The height of the same variety increased by 50% after application. Comparing Sizi No. 4 and 2B cotton, the former's height was greater than the latter after August, while the untreated plants showed the opposite trend. This is because aphid infestation was more severe before early August, and after August, rainfall increased, reducing aphid infestation, leading to a sudden increase in height. This shows that Sizi 2B is more sensitive to aphid infestation than Sizi No. 4.
　　(2) Impact of aphid infestation on the number of leaf branches of cotton plants: After application, the number of leaf branches increased by 100-200%, and Sizi No. 4 had more leaf branches than Sizi 2B.
　　(3) Impact of aphid infestation on the number of fruit branches of cotton plants: After application, the number of fruit branches increased by 50%.
　　(4) Impact of aphid infestation on the number of stem nodes of cotton plants: After application, the number of stem nodes increased by 50%.
　　(5) Impact of aphid infestation on the number of leaves of cotton plants: After application, the number of leaves increased by 70-130%.
　　(6) Impact of aphid infestation on the length of cotton plant leaves: After application, the length of leaves increased by 150%.
　　(7) Impact of aphid infestation on the number of buds of cotton plants: After application, the number of buds increased by 100-200%, with Sizi No. 4 having more than Sizi 2B. The untreated 2B cotton originally had fewer buds than the No. 4 cotton, but after the aphid infestation subsided at the end of July, the opposite was true.
　　(8) Impact of aphid infestation on the number of cotton bolls: After application, the number of cotton bolls increased by 200%, with 2B cotton having more than No. 4 cotton.
　　(9) Impact of aphid infestation on the timing of cotton boll opening: The timing of boll opening is closely related to yield and quality. Bolls that open before the frost have higher quality. If boll opening is too late, the cotton fibers cannot fully develop, the color turns yellow, and sometimes the bolls cannot even open, reducing both the product and the quality. Of the un-opened cotton bolls left after application, 85% opened on their own after exposure to sunlight, compared to only 35% of the untreated bolls. The impact of application on Sizi No. 4 cotton was smaller, while 100% of the treated 2B cotton bolls were able to open before the frost, compared to 28% of the untreated bolls that were unable to open. This is further proof that 2B cotton is more sensitive to aphid infestation than No. 4 cotton.

　　鱼藤粉防治棉蚜的功效试验
    朱弘复
    鱼藤粉—黄褐色粉末，由鱼藤根所磨成。鱼藤根为植物性三大杀虫剂之一，产于亚洲热带及亚热带如南洋群岛、台湾等地。其所含主要有效成分为鱼藤酮，用作杀虫剂时既可为胃毒剂又可为接触剂，对鱼类之毒力极强，对蚜虫之毒力较烟草硷大十至十五倍，对于苍蝇较除虫菊毒力大六倍，对植物及人畜则无损害，故在我国是一有效而普遍的杀虫剂。
    这个试验着重在“受蚜害棉株施用鱼藤粉后之生长，产量品质等与未施药者的比较”，故只有施药与未施药唯一的差别因子。棉田位于北平西郊万牲园内，共划分为十六等大棉区。棉种为斯字棉４Ｂ及２Ｂ二种，各占八个棉区，其中四区施以鱼藤粉，另四区则未施用。同时于一九四八年四月十四日下种，中间施肥二次，施用杀虫剂二次，除草颇勤，棉田间没有一棵杂草。
    试验结果，凡施用鱼藤粉之棉株生长迅速，发育高大，第一次施药（六月初旬）后，蚜虫的死亡率是８９．５％第二次施药后（六月中间）蚜虫之死亡率为７３．６％，第三次施药（七月初旬）后的死亡率为７３．１％。施药后的总收获每亩增加１００—２００斤（籽棉），另从区总产量可以看出下列几个结果。
    （１）施药后之斯字棉４Ｂ，籽棉产量较未施药者高至一倍半以上，斯字２Ｂ则高至二倍左右。
    （２）施药之斯字４Ｂ棉总产量较施药之２Ｂ棉为低，每亩相差２５市斤左右。未施药之４Ｂ棉产量较未施药之２Ｂ棉为高，每亩相差５０市斤左右。
    （３）斯字２Ｂ棉对蚜害之反应较斯字四号为敏感。
    至于棉株受蚜害之影响与以药治理后之生长情形详细分述于下：
    （１）蚜害对于棉株高度之影响：同一品种施药后之高度增加５０％如将斯字４号与２Ｂ棉相比，则前者之高度在八月以后，较后者为大，而未施药者则较小，其原因在于八月初以前蚜害较甚，八月以后雨量多，蚜害减轻，因此高度突然增加。由此可见斯字２Ｂ对于蚜害较斯字４号为敏感。
    （２）蚜害对于棉株叶枝数之影响：施药后，叶枝数增加１００—２００％而斯字４号则较斯字２Ｂ为多。
    （３）蚜害对于棉株果枝数之影响：施药后果枝数增加５０％。
    （４）蚜害对于棉株茎节数之影响：施药后茎节数增加５０％。
    （５）蚜害对于棉株叶数之影响：施药后叶数增加７０—１３０％。
    （６）蚜害对于棉株叶片长度之影响：施药后叶片长度增加１５０％。
    （７）蚜害对于棉株蕾数之影响：施药后蕾数增加１００—２００％，斯字４号则又比斯字２Ｂ为多，不施药之２Ｂ棉原较４号棉为少，但在七月底以后，蚜害减轻时则反较多。
    （８）蚜害对于棉株铃数之影响：施药后棉铃增加２００％，而２Ｂ棉多于４号棉。
    （９）蚜害对于棉株开絮期迟早之影响：开絮期早晚与产量品质有很大关系，下霜前开絮之品质高，开絮过晚时，棉絮不能充分发育，色泽发黄，有时甚至不能吐絮，产品与品质也随之而减低。施药后所遗留未开絮之棉桃、经曝晒后自行开裂者达８５％，反之仅在３５％。施药对于斯字４号棉之影响较小，而施药之２Ｂ百分之百能在霜前吐絮，未施药者则有２８％不能吐絮，这也是２Ｂ对蚜害较４号棉敏感的证明。
