Xinhua News Agency, Peiping, 3rd.—Pyongyang dispatch: Since the preparatory committee of the Korean Democratic United Fatherland Front (formerly translated as the Democratic National United Front) began its work, a broad patriotic enthusiasm has been growing among the people of all strata in Korea. Workers in many factories in North Korea are welcoming the establishment of the Fatherland Front with selfless labor and enthusiastic competition. A representative of workers from the cheese factory in Qingjin, North Korea, said: The unification of our motherland is entirely possible. The urgent task at present is to unite the democratic forces of North and South Korea. Korean workers will work hard for an independent and free Korea. A representative of workers from the locomotive repair factory in Seoul, South Korea, said: The establishment of the Fatherland Front is a fatal blow to the Syngman Rhee puppet government. It will clarify the current political situation in Korea. Representatives of cultural groups, such as Li Kiyong (transliteration), chairman of the North Korea-Soviet Cultural Association, and Li Saiden (transliteration), vice chairman of the Federation of Literary and Art Workers, have declared their sincere support for the establishment of the Fatherland Front. Deng Jicheng (transliteration), vice chairman of the North Korean Democratic Women's League, said: We must unite to fight for the withdrawal of US troops and the unification of the motherland. Let us unite all our strength around the Democratic Fatherland Front and complete the unification of Korea.
　　At the same time, responses to the circular on the establishment of the Democratic Fatherland Front from various parties and groups in Korea continue to arrive, including organizations such as the Independent Democratic Party of South Korea, the Working People's Party, the Social Democratic Party, the Farmers' Party, the South Korean Independent Women's Federation, and the Korean Patriotic Women's Federation.
