    Ping Post Administration and Savings & Remittance Bureau:
    Rapid Development of Remittance Business
    [Our Newspaper] The remittance business of the Beiping Post Administration, the Beiping Postal Savings and Remittance Bureau, and its affiliated branches and offices has developed rapidly since liberation. The issuance and payment of money orders have increased month by month. In March, 3,061 money orders were issued and 3,107 were paid; in April, 5,042 were issued and 4,419 were paid. In May, the number of money orders issued increased to 9,014, and the number paid reached 8,627. With the expansion of the liberated areas in Jiangnan in June, the remittance business has developed even more rapidly. Ninety percent of those remitting money are workers, students, and government employees. In order to facilitate the masses, the North China Postal Administration is currently planning to establish universal remittance services with the liberated areas. After the economic relationship between the newly and old liberated areas is established, the post office can utilize its widespread organizational advantages to contribute to the prosperity of urban and rural economies.
