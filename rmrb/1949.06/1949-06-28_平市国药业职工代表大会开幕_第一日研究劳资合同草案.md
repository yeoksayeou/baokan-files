　　The Opening of the National Pharmaceutical Industry Workers' Congress in Ping City
  　First Day Studying the Draft Labor-Capital Contract
　　[Reported by this newspaper] After many days of preparation, the National Pharmaceutical Industry Workers' Congress in Ping City opened at 10:00 AM yesterday (the 27th). Present were all sixty representatives, as well as comrades from the Ping City Federation of Trade Unions Preparatory Committee, guests from various industries, and capitalist representatives Li Ziyuan and Wang Youzhi, totaling over seventy people. In order to strengthen the unity and learning of workers and staff, and to resolve labor-capital relations based on the New Democratic economic policy, the National Pharmaceutical Industry Workers' Union Preparatory Committee in Ping City was established at the end of last month. In over twenty days, with the theme of "mutual benefit for labor and capital, developing production," considerable achievements have been made through multiple forums and group discussions, as well as explanations to all workers and staff in the industry. Furthermore, many grassroots workers' unions have been established, and the city-wide National Pharmaceutical Industry Workers' Union is about to be established. The draft labor-capital contract proposed by the labor side and the draft constitution of the National Pharmaceutical Industry Workers' Union have also been formulated and urgently need to be reviewed and revised by the Congress. Therefore, this National Pharmaceutical Industry Workers' Congress was promptly convened. At the meeting, the person in charge of the Preparatory Committee reported on the work of preparation, and in addition to pointing out the achievements, he specifically pointed out the shortcomings of past work, such as the existence of many incorrect views among workers and staff regarding the policy of mutual benefit for labor and capital, explaining that the understanding and explanation of the policy was still insufficient, and that it still needs to be strengthened in the future. Comrade Zhang Chunju of the City Federation of Trade Unions explained that the National Pharmaceutical Industry Workers' Congress is the highest authority of the National Pharmaceutical Industry Workers' organization. Therefore, he requested everyone to earnestly and responsibly discuss the topics set by the meeting. The meeting was filled with an atmosphere of unity and harmony. Guests from the bathhouse and oil and salt industries said: "We are all the same workers and staff, we should unite politically and seek unity in thought." Some representatives put forward many valuable suggestions for the improvement of national pharmaceutical production. In the afternoon, all representatives studied the draft labor-capital contract in detail before adjourning. Today (the 28th), they will continue to study the draft labor-capital contract proposed by the capitalist side, pass the draft constitution of the workers' union organization, elect the official workers' union of the industry, and discuss future work and other matters. It is heard that after this meeting, both labor and capital will reach a mutually agreed-upon draft labor-capital contract.

　　平市国药业职工代表大会开幕
  　第一日研究劳资合同草案
    【本报讯】平市国药业职工代表大会经多日筹备，已于昨（二十七）日上午十时开幕。到全体代表六十人，及市总工会筹备会同志、各行业来宾、资方代表李滋元与王佑之等共七十余人。为了加强职工的团结与学习，根据新民主主义的经济政策解决劳资关系，平市国药业职工于上月底成立了职工会筹备会，在二十多天中，以“劳资两利，发展生产”为主题，经多次座谈与小组讨论，并向该业全体职工解释说明，已获有相当成绩；且下层职工会多已建立，全市国药业职工会即应成立；劳方所提出之劳资合同草案、国药业职工会章程草案亦已经制订，急待代表大会审查修正；因之，此次国药业职工代表大会随即产生。会上，筹备会负责人报告筹备工作中，除指出所得成绩外，并特别指出过去的工作缺点，如对劳资两利政策，在职工中尚存在着很多不正确的看法，说明了解释政策还很不够，今后仍须加强。市职工会张春久同志解释了国药业职工代表大会是国药业职工组织的最高权力机关，因此，要求大家认真负责讨论会议所拟定之课题。会议充满了团结融洽的空气，如浴堂业和油盐业来宾说：“我们都是一样的职工，我们应从政治上团结起来，在思想上求得统一。”有的代表对国药业生产的改进提了不少宝贵意见。同日下午，各代表详细研究劳资合同草案后休会。今天（二十八日），将继续研究资方所提出之劳资合同草案，通过职工会组织章程草案，选举该业正式职工会，讨论今后工作等事宜。闻此次会议后，劳资双方将得出一个共同承认的劳资合同草案来。
