Soviet Music
    (Random Talks on the Soviet Union - No. 4)
    Mao Dun
    The development of Soviet music is extremely widespread and diverse. The planned nature of music education, the mass character of musical movements, and the state's support for the creative activities of composers and musicians—all of these are reasons for the development of Soviet music. On the one hand, Soviet composers inherited the excellent traditions of Russian classical music, and on the other hand, they developed the characteristics of the Soviet era. The so-called Russian classical music refers to the works of great writers such as Glinka, Borodin, Mussorgsky, Rimsky-Korsakov, and Tchaikovsky.
    Famous modern Soviet composers, such as S. Prokofiev, D. Shostakovich, N. Myaskovsky, A. Khachaturian, D. Kabalevsky, etc., are all famous throughout the world.
    Prokofiev composed a great variety of works; his works draw inspiration from folk songs, and the melodies are bright and cheerful. Shostakovich's talent is expressed in his symphonies; the Fifth, Seventh, and Eighth, among others, are world-renowned. Myaskovsky is most able to inherit and develop Russian classical symphonic music. Khachaturian's talent, as expressed in his two symphonies and dances, is rich in national characteristics (he is Armenian) and emotionally intense. Kabalevsky is also a composer with a strong national flavor. He has composed many operas and one or two symphonies.
    Other Soviet republics, especially those with relatively backward cultures in the past, have now also produced numerous composers. It goes without saying that Ukraine, Belarus, Georgia, and Armenia all have new outstanding composers; and such places as Azerbaijan and Uzbekistan, whose modern music history is only thirty years old, now also have composers such as Gebbebekov (Azerbaijan) and Asilla Rafi.
    The Soviet Composers' Association currently has 900 members and its own printing press and concert hall.
    The Soviet people, men, women, old and young, have a special love for music. The clubs of various factories and organizations have amateur music groups that perform regularly. As for public concerts organized by cultural associations or music schools, they are held almost every day in large and small towns. In addition to this, there are also lectures on music, which are often held in large cities. In the countryside, amateur singing teams can be seen everywhere, with music rising in the setting sun and fragrant grass. In the Soviet Union, music is as common as air.
    The state of Soviet music education can be seen from the following figures: there are currently 400 elementary music schools in the Soviet Union, with 60,000 students. In addition to music courses, these schools also teach other general courses. Students with special talents can enter advanced music schools, of which there are 16, all of which are affiliated with 22 state conservatories, with a total of about 4,000 students. There are also approximately 17,000 teenagers in special music schools, of which there are 109. In the 22 conservatories, there are approximately 6,000 students receiving stipends, all of whom are engaged in specialized research. In addition, there are children's singing schools that cultivate future choirs, the most famous of which is in Moscow.

　　苏维埃音乐
    （杂谈苏联之四）
    茅盾
    苏联音乐的发展是极其普遍而多种多样的。音乐教育之富有计划性，音乐运动之群众性，国家对于作曲家和音乐家的创造活动之扶助，——这一切都是苏联音乐发达的原因。苏维埃作曲家一方面继承了俄罗斯古典音乐的优良传统，一方面发挥其苏维埃时代的特点。所谓俄罗斯古典音乐就是格林卡、鲍罗庭、摩琐尔斯基、陵斯基。柯尔萨可夫、恰伊考夫斯基等大作家的作品。
    现代苏维埃著名的作曲家，如Ｓ·普罗柯非也夫，Ｄ·萧斯塔可维区，Ｎ·玛耶斯考夫斯基，Ａ·喀却托良，Ｄ·卡巴列夫斯基，等等，都是在全世界有名的。
    普罗柯非也夫所作，种类极多；他的作品汲取灵感于民间歌曲，调子朗爽而愉快。萧斯塔可维区的才能，表现于他所作的交响曲；第五，第七，第八等曲有名于世界。玛耶斯考夫斯基最能继承而发展了俄罗斯古典交响乐。喀却托良的才能，如在他的两支交响曲及舞曲中所表现，富于民族色彩（他是阿尔美尼亚人）而情绪激昂。卡巴列夫斯基也是民族色彩很浓厚的作曲家，他作了歌剧多种，及交响曲一二种。
    苏联的其他加盟共和国，特别是从前文化比较落后的共和国，现在也产生了众多的作曲家。乌克兰，白俄罗斯，乔其亚，阿尔美尼亚，——这些共和国，都有新的优秀作曲家，这是不用说的了；而如阿赛尔拜疆，乌兹别克，它们的近代音乐的历史还不过三十多年，现在也有了如同格部贝可夫（阿赛尔拜疆）和阿西拉菲那样的作曲家。
    苏联作曲家协会现有会员九百人，自己有印刷所和演奏厅。
    苏联人民，男女老幼，对于音乐，特有嗜好。各工厂，机关的俱乐部，都有业余的音乐组，经常定期演奏。至于由文化社团或音乐学校所组织的公开演奏会，在大城小镇，几乎无日无之。除此而外，还有关于音乐的讲演会，大城市中也常常有之。乡村中间，到处可见业余的歌咏队，夕阳芳草，乐声四起，音乐在苏联，真是和空气一样普遍的。
    苏联音乐教育的情形可以从下列的数字得到一个概况：全苏现有初级音乐学校四百所，学生六万人，这些学校内除音乐课程外，也教其他一般的课程。特有才能的学生则可入高级音乐学校，这一类学校共十六所，都和二十二个国立音乐院有联系，学生共约四千人。又有大约一万七千个十来岁的学生在特种音乐学校，此项学校共有一百○九所。在二十二个音乐院中，大约有六千个领受津贴的学生，他们都是作专门研究的。此外，尚有培植将来的合唱队的儿童歌咏学校，在莫斯科的最为有名。
