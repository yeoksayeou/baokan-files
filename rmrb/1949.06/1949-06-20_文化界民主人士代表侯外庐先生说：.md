　　Mr. Hou Wailu, representative of democratic figures in the cultural circle, said:
    The Preparatory Committee of the New Political Consultative Conference has victoriously concluded. This is the preliminary project of the people's democratic dictatorship in the new China. It not only satisfies the expectations of the Chinese people, but also creates a brilliant new era unprecedented in history. All the representative democratic parties, people's organizations, professional strata, as well as ethnic minorities and overseas Chinese across the country are united like iron, forming our political foundation. I think that the imperialists and the remaining Chinese reactionaries will tremble and even be jealous in the face of the success of this conference, while world peace-loving democrats and the Chinese people will surely applaud and be overjoyed!
    The Preparatory Committee of the New Political Consultative Conference included 23 units and 134 representatives. Except for the reactionaries who are not allowed here, it is indeed the most extensive great unity of democratic forces. I dare to say with an attitude of loyalty to truth and scholarship that the degree of democracy in the Preparatory Committee of the New Political Consultative Conference is a million times higher than the false democracy of capitalism. It is a truly free form with broad representation, a creation of new democracy. However, we also admit that it is also a dictatorship, but only for the extremely small number of reactionary families within the country, in order to ensure genuine people's democracy and to exclude the democratic rights of a small number of counter-revolutionaries. The Chinese people agree with us.
    The history of the new China has thus entered the right track. The difficult first step has been initially resolved by gathering the opinions of people from all walks of life in China. However, the thorny road still awaits the people of the whole country to tread. We have 120% confidence to create a beautiful garden of the People's Republic of China!

　　文化界民主人士代表侯外庐先生说：
    新政治协商会议筹备会胜利地闭幕了，这是新中国人民民主专政的初步工程，不但满足了中国人民的期待，而且史无前例地开创了光辉的新纪元。全国拥有代表性的各民主党派、各人民团体、各职业阶层、以及少数民族与华侨，团结得如铁一般，就形成了我们的政治基础。我想，帝国主义与中国反动残余要在这会议的成功面前发抖以至忌刻，而世界和平民主人士与中国人民则一定是拍手称庆、欢心鼓舞的！
    新政协筹备会包括了二十三单位，一百三十四代表，除了反动派不许在这里而外，的确是最广泛的民主力量大团结。我敢以忠于真理与学术的态度说，新政协筹备会的民主程度比资本主义的假民主，高出了一百万倍，是真正具有广大代表性的自由形式，是新民主主义的创作。然而我们亦承认同时是专政，只对于那些全国范围内极少数家族的反动派而施行专政，为了真正的人民民主获得保障而排斥了少数反革命者的民主权利。中国人民是同意我们的。
    新中国历史由此开进了正轨，困难的第一步因集合了中国各方人士的意见而初告解决，但荆棘的道路犹待全中国人民去践踏，我们是有十二分的信心来创设起中华人民民主共和国的美丽花园的！
