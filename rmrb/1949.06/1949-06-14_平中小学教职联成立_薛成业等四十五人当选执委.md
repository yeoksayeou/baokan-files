    [Our Newspaper] The first representative assembly of the Ping-Jin Elementary and Secondary School Teachers' Union, representing more than 6,000 elementary and secondary school teachers and staff members in Beiping, successfully concluded yesterday (the 13th). During the closing ceremony, Liu [illegible character], the director of the Beiping Municipal Education Bureau, and others attended and delivered speeches. The closing ceremony began at 4:00 PM, with Xue Chengye, representing the presidium of the assembly, delivering the closing remarks. He pointed out that the main achievement of this assembly was to reach a consensus on strengthening learning, transforming thinking, serving the people, and establishing new teaching attitudes and a revolutionary outlook on life in the future. At the same time, it united the city's outstanding educators in an unprecedented way. Democracy was fully learned and promoted at the assembly, and teachers' own organizations were established. Finally, he hoped that the representatives would bring the spirit of this assembly back to every school. Following this was a speech by Director Liu [illegible character], who emphasized that after the victorious advance of the People's Liberation Army today, we still need a large cultural liberation army to carry out the struggle against old ideologies and consciousness, which is a long-term struggle. At the same time, we must first strengthen our own ideological transformation and learning, so that teachers can complete the task of leading the education of the second generation in the future. We must criticize the old education and then establish a systematic New Democracy education. Director Liu also hoped that the Teachers' Union would do more practical work in the future, solve practical problems in education, improve the atmosphere of learning, and complete the summer study work well. Finally, the assembly unanimously passed two telegrams to Chairman Mao of the Chinese Communist Party and Commander-in-Chief Zhu, as well as to democratic parties, people's organizations, and education workers across the country, and victoriously concluded in a warm and united atmosphere at around 5:00 PM.
