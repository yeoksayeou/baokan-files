　　“Backward Brains” (Continued)

　　　　　(6) "Willing to Trade My Life!"

　　After listening to Han Junting's conversation, Ma Ziliang and several other veteran soldiers felt that things had become strange, as if the sun had risen in the west; at the same time, they also felt the smoothest things since the first shift.

　　After talking with the three of them, a squad meeting was held. Han Junting talked about some experiences in making ad hoc movements. The new comrades felt they had gained a lot. At the end, it was still that sentence:

　　"In case of anything, everyone follow me and watch my actions!"

　　The whole squad felt that this annoying squad leader had suddenly become lovable, at least the whole squad had someone to rely on.

　　These past two days, Han Junting had been much more nervous than before. After the company assigned the first squad to help the anti-aircraft gun squad, Han Junting, without eating breakfast the next day, pulled Ma Ziliang to the anti-aircraft gun squad, set up the anti-aircraft gun, looked at it again and again, checked the bullets, pulled the bolt, looked at whether the parts were dirty, and asked softly each time he looked at a part:

　　"How is it? Old Ma! No problems, right!?………”

　　"These bullets are new, but I'm afraid there's too much oil on them, soaking the base! Look, what kind of oil is used? Vaseline? Machine oil? If too much oil is applied, it easily attracts dirt!…………"

　　"Exactly!" Ma Ziliang answered, often before Ma Ziliang could finish stating his opinions, Han Junting would raise new questions.

　　"I wonder how the firing pin is! This kind of anti-aircraft gun, I'm afraid the firing pin isn't good!…………"

　　He also talked with the whole squad in charge of the anti-aircraft gun about the characteristics of this gun, what problems it had, what to pay attention to, how much firepower it had, who was most skilled in disassembling and using it… He also studied where it should be set up on the spot, to be both concealed and facilitate the exertion of firepower… It seemed he was even more concerned than the squad leader of that squad.

　　There were many rumors outside, saying that "the Central Government" would be coming north, how many Eighth Route Armymen had been eliminated in the front, and how many guns, cannons, and bullets had been captured from the Eighth Route Army. The new comrades were half-believing and half-doubting, and were uneasy all day long. The new soldiers couldn't stop asking:

　　"Is it true, Squad Leader!"

　　When answering these questions, Han Junting's words were often very simple; he mostly squinted his eyes and snorted twice from his nose:

　　"Those are all the Kuomintang's wishful thinking! The Eighth Route Army—since the day I knew it—only knows how to seize the enemy's guns, and has never heard of surrendering guns to others! That time, the three of us were surrounded by more than a hundred enemies. They thought there was no escape this time, and shouted to surrender like dogs! Our three guns fired together, and we still broke through... Humph! Why listen to that!? If you only listen to the cicadas chirping, you wouldn't need to farm!"

　　These words spread throughout the squad, the platoon, and the company in less than two days. No one listened to these rumors. Everyone said:

　　"If you only listen to the cicadas chirping, you wouldn't need to farm!"

　　Kuomintang planes flew in one or two at a time every two or three days, cruising along the railway line and constantly damaging the locomotives. The first time a plane flew over the Zhangwu Bridge, many new soldiers hurriedly dived into the sorghum fields. Han Junting told his squad to sit steadily in a small ditch next to the anti-aircraft gun. When the plane was overhead, several new soldiers whispered:

　　"Squad Leader! There are too many of us, it's a big target, they'll see us!"

　　Han Junting squatted next to the anti-aircraft gun, his eyes fixed on the plane. He heard these words very clearly. He turned his head and looked at everyone. His face, which never had a smile all year round, was the same as before the plane came. The soldiers, upon seeing this, felt their hanging hearts drop back into their stomachs. They remembered Han Junting's words:

　　"Watch my actions!"

　　After a few times like this, everyone got used to it; when enemy planes came, they could all listen to orders in an orderly and unhurried manner.

　　What was most worrying was the night.

　　There were many small trees here. During the day they were trees, but at night, from a distance, they looked almost like people; when the wind shook them, and added some sound, the eyes, tired and drowsy in the dead of night, saw them three times more like people. The new soldiers had no experience, were not calm, and fired their guns when they didn't hear a response to two calls of the password—this kind of thing happened several times in a row. Han Junting repeatedly told everyone: "Be calm, call the password, hide well. Even if it's the enemy, they can't figure out where we are. We're in the dark, the enemy is in the light. Wait for them to get close, and shoot one dead with one shot. Everyone is afraid! What's scary is firing guns randomly without hitting anyone, letting the enemy know that we're panicking, and then the enemy will advance boldly!" He talked about his experience on sentry duty, each time talking a lot, and each time always giving one instruction:

　　"Don't let suspicion breed ghosts! Be calm, and look carefully!"

　　When he was on duty with the squad, he paid more attention than usual, going to the sentry post every now and then to see if anything was happening. The more careful the soldiers were, the more things they saw and heard. As soon as Han Junting came, stood next to them, and vaguely felt his expression, which had no panic at all, most of the problem was solved, and after a few words of conversation, they were completely calm. Their eyes also immediately became clear, and they could see everything distinctly.

　　Everyone's impression of Squad Leader Han had changed greatly in a few days. The company also asked him to discuss several issues: air defense preparations, strengthening sentry posts… Han Junting's spirits were also much more relaxed.

　　This morning, after breakfast, the comrades of the first squad were all smoking. Han Junting, as usual, pinched this person's cigarette and then that person's cigarette, tasting everyone's cigarettes, picking the most palatable one, grabbing a handful, and putting it in his own tobacco pouch. Some comrades said half-jokingly:

　　"Grab a little less! Three thousand yuan a catty!"

　　Han Junting, with his old face, always said:

　　"Three thousand, ten thousand, I still have to smoke! I have this skill: no matter how expensive the cigarettes are, I have to smoke them, no matter how cheap the cigarettes are, I won't buy them!"

　　This "smoking scripture" was also famous throughout the company and the battalion. They were used to it, and everyone didn't bother to argue with him much. The new soldier Li Zhenbang was the tightest with his money, with only a thousand Northeast currency left. He bought yellow tobacco all at once, buying the best tobacco leaves. He said:

　　"Damn it! If you're going to smoke, smoke the good stuff! It can satisfy your cravings!"

　　He bought a total of more than two taels (in the Northeast, it's ten taels per catty—note), removing the tobacco stems, and there wasn't much left in one handful. Han Junting happened to get a taste for it, and as usual, reached out his hand, grabbing nine-tenths of it. Li Zhenbang was dumbfounded. After swallowing a mouthful of smoke, he said with a serious face:

　　"Hey! Easy! Leave me some face!"

　　"What's wrong?" Han Junting's face was as stiff as an iron plate: "Can't I smoke your tobacco!? Is it worth making such a fuss!? Revolutionary comrades, willing to trade their lives! All the political instructor's lessons were wasted!"

　　"Trade lives! Who's seen that!?" Li Zhenbang didn't give in.

　　"That's called lacking solidarity, peasant consciousness!…"

　　Han Junting shouted again, and everyone hurried to persuade them, and only after much persuasion did they gather to work. The comrades of the first squad felt like they had another block of ice in their hearts. Li Zhenbang muttered behind his back:

　　"A dog can't stop eating shit!…"

　　Usually, when he heard these words, Ma Ziliang would at most smile, or incidentally add a word or two to vent his feelings. This time, Ma Ziliang heard it and said differently than usual:

　　"He just likes to take small advantages, but these days he's really been thinking about everyone!"

　　"Others haven't been idle either! I haven't seen him care about anyone else!" Li Zhenbang grumbled, and a few other new soldiers watched. Ma Ziliang was about to explain when Zhang Chunshan interjected:

　　"That's just not right! These days with enemy activity and planes, you see Old Han running around day and night, talking and instructing, guaranteeing that he's extra careful on night sentry, with his heart pounding. When Old Han comes, it's like taking a sedative! When the planes are buzzing overhead, everyone is flustered, but Old Han stays put guarding the anti-aircraft gun; he's been telling us all day, watch my actions if anything happens! With just that, would you say he's been thinking about us? Let's think about it calmly, if it weren't for Old Han taking charge these days, could our squad have slept soundly!? Of course, he has his faults, but you can't see a scar and say he's all bad!"

　　"Right, Zhang Chunshan said everything I wanted to say in one breath! Everyone should think clearly! Criticize what should be criticized, forgive what should be forgiven. Isn't Old Han's smoking a few pouches of our yellow tobacco worth it!? Of course, I also know that Li Zhenbang turned his pockets inside out and bought all that yellow tobacco with that thousand Northeast currency, wanting to have his fill, and now he's been completely cleaned out, so he can't help but feel sad! It doesn't matter, whoever has some to smoke, you'll definitely have some! Old Li! Don't worry!"

　　"It's not that I care about that little bit! I just had a moment of frustration!…" Li Zhenbang said indifferently.

　　After that, Ma Ziliang and the other veteran soldiers told about how heroic Han Junting was in the past, how he wasn't afraid of sacrifice on the front lines, etc., all to prove that his words "Revolutionary comrades, willing to trade their lives!" were true. In the end, everyone felt that Old Han's lovableness outweighed his annoyance.

　　“落后的脑袋”　（续）
    李尔重
  　　　　　（六）“命都换的着！”
    马子亮几个老战士听了韩俊庭谈话，一面觉着事情变得异样，不知太阳怎么从西出来；一面也感到第一班以后第一次的顺当。
    和他们三个谈了以后，开了一次班务会，韩俊庭讲了些临机动作的经验，新同志觉着收获不小，到末尾还是那一句：
    “万一有什么事，大家就跟着我，看我的动作行事！”
    全班觉着这个讨厌班长忽然变得可爱了，超码是全班有了个靠头。
    这两天，韩俊庭比以前紧张了许多，连里分配一班帮助机关炮班以后，第二天没有吃早饭，韩俊庭就拉着马子亮到伊斯古机班里，把伊斯古机架起来，看了又看，又检查了子弹，拉了拉拴，看了看机件脏不脏，看了一件小声地问一回：
    “怎么样？老马！没毛病吧！？………”
    “这子弹新到是新，就怕是油擦的太多了，浸透了屁股门，打不叫！你看，用的什么油？凡士林？机器油？油上的多，容易着土！…………”
    “就是！”马子亮答着，往往是还未等马子亮把看到的意见说完，韩俊庭又提出新问题。
    “撞针不知怎么样呢！这种伊斯古，就怕撞针不好！…………”
    又和管伊斯古机的全班交谈了关于这架机关炮的特点，有什么毛病，那处应该注意，射击力量有多大，谁拆卸使用顶熟，…………又研究了在现场上应该架在什么地方，又隐蔽，又便于发扬火力…………好象他比这班班长还关心。
    外边谣言很多，说是“中央”多少，就要北来，前面消灭了多少八路军，得了八路军多少枪炮子弹，新同志们半信半疑，一天慌慌地不安定，新战士们断不了问：
    “是真的么？班长！”
    韩俊庭在答复这些问题时，话语上常常很简单；多半是把眼斜楞一下，鼻子里连连吭两声：
    “那都是国民党的梦话！八路军——打我认识那天起——光知道缴敌人的枪，压根就没听说过缴枪给人家！那回，我们三个人，叫他妈的一百多敌人围住，他们寻思着这回没跑，象狗叫似地叫喊缴枪！我们三根枪连在一起打，还是闯了出来……哼！听那做啥！？光听蝼蝼蛄叫唤就不用种地啦！”
    这个话，没有两天便传遍了全班全排全连，谁也不听这些谣言，大家都说：
    “光听蝼蝼蛄叫唤就不用种地啦！”
    国民党的飞机，三天两天地飞来一架两架，在铁路线上转游，断不了打坏了火车头。第一回有一架飞机，飞到彰武桥的上空了，许多新战士慌忙地钻进了高粮地里，韩俊庭叫他的一班稳稳地坐在伊斯古机旁的一条小沟里。当着飞机到了头上时，几个新战士小声说：
    “班长！咱们人太多，目标大，看见了！”
    韩俊庭蹲在伊斯古机旁边，两眼望着飞机，听这话听的很清楚，他转过头来，望了望大家，他那终年没有笑容的脸色，和飞机没来时的脸色一样，战士们一看，一棵悬空的心，就落在肚子里。就想起韩俊庭的话：
    “看我的动作行事！”
    有了这末几回，大家便习惯了；敌机来时，都能够有次序地不慌乱地听指挥。
    最使人耽心的还是夜晚。
    此地小树棵子很多，白天是树，到夜晚老远一看，和人差不多；风一摇，再出点声音，深夜里疲倦了的带昏迷的眼睛一望，更加三分象人。新战士没经验，不沉着，两声口令不见答音，就放枪——这样的事，连续地发生了几次。韩俊庭一再地给大家讲：“要沉着，喊口令，要隐蔽好，就是敌人，也摸不清咱在那里，咱们在暗处，敌人在明处，等他靠近，一枪削死一个，什么人也怕！就怕乱放枪不打人，告诉了敌人，咱们慌了神，敌人才大胆前进呢！”他讲岗哨上的经验，每次讲了许多，每次总要叮咛一句：
    “不要疑心生暗鬼！要沉着，要看准！”
    他带班，比平时注意的多，一会就到哨上，看看有什么事情。战士们越小心，眼里看到的，耳朵听到的事情越多，单等韩俊庭一来，到他身边一站，朦胧中觉到他那副一点也没有恐慌的脸色，问题就解决了大半，交谈上三言两语，便全心平静。眼睛也马上清凉起来，万物看得分明。
    大家对韩班长的印象，几天里有了很大转变。连里头又找他商量过几次问题：防空准备，岗哨加强……韩俊庭的精神也舒畅了许多。
    这天早上，吃过了早饭，一班同志们都在吸烟。韩俊庭照老例，掐了这个人的烟，又掐那个人的烟，人人的烟都尝遍了，捡那味道最可口的那一份，抓上一把，装在自己烟包里。有的同志就半真半假地说：
    “少抓点！三千块呀，一斤！”
    韩俊庭老着个脸皮，常是这样地说：
    “三千，一万我也得抽烟！就有这分本事：烟多贵我也得抽，烟多贱我也不买！”
    这条“抽烟经”在全连全营也是有名的。惯了，大家也不大和他计较了。新战士李振邦手里最紧，就剩下一千块东北票，一下子都买了黄烟，买的是上等烟叶，他说是：
    “妈的！抽就抽好的！能解馋！”
    一共买了有二两多（在东北是十两一斤——注）去了烟梗子，一撮就没有多少。韩俊庭偏偏尝上了口，照例伸过手去，可把一抓，去了十分之九。李振邦弄了个白瞪眼，一口烟咽下之后，满脸严肃地说道：
    “嘿！轻点！留点面子！”
    “怎么着？”韩俊庭脸绷的象铁板：“不叫抽你袋烟么！？值得这样子！？革命同志，命都换的着！批导员的课都白上了！”
    “换命！谁看见来着！”李振邦不服劲。
    “你这就叫不讲团结，农民意识！……”
    韩俊庭又叫了起来，大家赶忙劝解，紧说慢说地才集合起来工作去了。一班的同志们又怀上一块冰。李振邦在背地里念叨：
    “狗改不了吃屎！……”
    平时，听到这种话，马子亮顶多是笑一笑，或者顺便再加上一两句，发泄发泄。这回，马子亮听了，和往日不同地说道：
    “他就是好沾点小便宜，这些日可真也为大家上心！”
    “别人也没有闲着！也未见他为谁上了什么心！”李振邦嘟哝着，几个别的新战士看着。马子亮正要解释，张春山在一旁插上说道：
    “那末说，就叫不对！这几天闹敌情闹飞机，你看老韩黑夜白日，跑里跑外，又是讲，又是嘱咐，管保黑夜放哨，小心眼里打突突。老韩一来，就象吃个定心丸！飞机到头上一嗡嗡，大家都慌手毛脚，人家老韩守着伊期古，动也不动；一天嘱咐，有事看我动作行事！就这一套，你说人家是上心了没有吧？对大家，咱们平心想想，这些时，要不是老韩跳＠，咱们一班能够睡个安心觉不能！？当然，他有毛病，可是不能看见个疤拉就说人家一身没好肉！”
    “对，我的话，张春山一口气都给我说啦！大家是该想清楚！该批评的批评，该原谅的就得原谅，象老韩这几天，抽咱们几袋黄烟还不值！？自然，我也知道，李振邦把口袋翻了个底朝上，就有那一千块东北票，一下子都买了黄烟，想过过瘾，这一家伙弄个溜干二净，心里也免不了难过！不要紧，大家有吸的，准少不了你的就是！老李！放心！”
    “我倒不是在乎那一星半点的！一时憋口气！…”李振邦无可无不可地说。
    之后，马子亮他们几个老战士，又把韩俊庭当年如何英勇，如何在火线上不怕牺牲等事，说了一回，无非是为了替他证明“革命同志，命都换的着！”的话是真的。末尾，大家又觉着老韩的可爱处，多过讨人厌处。
