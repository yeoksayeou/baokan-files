Some Suggestions on Teaching Songs to Troops
    Kē Fū

　　Our troops' soldiers are very fond of singing. Each soldier can sing at least twenty or thirty songs, singing while eating, singing during roll call, singing while marching, singing while fighting. Whenever there is a little time, they consider singing a very important thing. This has become a traditional habit of the People's Liberation Army, and this is also one of the differences from all previous armies. When the soldiers sing, they truly express the heroic spirit and revolutionary temperament of our revolutionary army. However, we still constantly hear some songs that are not sung well, failing to express the characteristics of a revolutionary army. Some complain that everyone doesn't follow the "beat" (conductor), or that the song is poorly written (of course, some of this cannot be denied), but there has been no review of the methods of teaching songs. I think teaching songs is a very important thing; if you don't teach well, you definitely won't sing well. Here are two suggestions for everyone to study.
    First, sing with vigor. That is, grasp the emotion and energy of the song and be able to sing it out. "Fight When Told" is a good song, but some people sing it very slowly and weakly, without a strong expression. It sounds like they're singing on an empty stomach, hungry. To put it bluntly, it sounds like moaning. But this is by no means the soldiers' fault, but mainly because the person teaching the song didn't study what the energy of the song is (that is, what kind of emotion). Our songs—revolutionary songs, soldiers' songs—generally have a strong and powerful or lively and cheerful energy, which can represent the collective strength. It is not appropriate to sing too slowly or too weakly, otherwise, it is easy to sing the song poorly.
    Second, get the pitch right. Now that large-scale corps operations are common, it is common for many companies to be together. When they start singing, they are uneven, with different pitches, making it difficult to listen to and difficult to conduct, and even more unable to express a unified overall strength. Therefore, this is also a very important issue. This is also something that the song teacher should pay attention to. In addition to singing the pitch accurately himself, he must also enable everyone to sing accurately. Some people teach songs sentence by sentence, and everyone follows along, without correcting mistakes. Once the song is memorized, it is even more difficult to correct. I feel that learning to sing mainly relies on the ears. If you hear the pitch accurately, it is easy to sing accurately; otherwise, you simply cannot sing accurately. We have experimented with a new method, that is, the person teaching the song sings it to the soldiers more before teaching, and sings out the energy as well. This easily infects everyone's emotions. After singing two or three times, you can ask everyone for their opinions on the song, asking if it sounds good or not. If it doesn't sound good, it may be poorly written, or the teacher may not have sung the energy out, so you can not teach it first. If it sounds good, you can read and explain the lyrics to the soldiers, so that in addition to the melody, they also retain an impression of the meaning of the words. This also makes it easier for them to get the pitch right. After the explanation, sing it again, and it doesn't matter if you sing it ten or eight times, until the soldiers have some impression, then start teaching sentence by sentence. Doing so can ensure the pitch is accurate and actually save time. The person teaching the song must put aside their embarrassment and teach with a hundred times the courage, not afraid of trouble.
    Or first teach a few activists (those who sing better) and use a few activists to perform repeatedly in front of the team to strengthen everyone's impression.
    These humble opinions are only for everyone's study and reference.

### 给部队教歌的几点意见

　　给部队教歌的几点意见
    柯夫
    我们的部队战士，都是非常喜欢唱歌的。每个战士起码会唱二三十个歌，吃饭时候唱，点名时候唱，行军时候唱，打仗时候唱，凡是能有一点点时间都把唱歌列为很重要的一件事情，这已成为人民解放军的传统习惯了，这也是和过去所有的一切军队不同之一点。战士们唱起歌来真把我们革命军队的英雄气概、革命气质充分的表现出来了。可是还不断的会听到有些歌是唱的不好的，表现不出革命军队的特质来。或者埋怨大家不看“拍子”（指挥），或者说歌编得不好（当然有些是不能否认的），而总没有从教歌的方法上来进行检讨。我觉得教歌歌是很重要的一件事情，教不好，就一定唱不好。下面提出两点意见来，供大家研究。
    一、唱歌唱劲。就是要把歌的感情、劲头把握住，能唱出来才行。“说打就打”是个好歌子，但有些人唱的很慢又很弱，没有力的表现，使人听了，象没吃饭、饿肚子唱的一样，说的不好听一点，真象呻吟。这样却丝毫不能怪战士的。而主要是教歌的人没先研究一下，这首歌的劲是什么（即是什么样的感情）。我们的歌——革命的歌，战士的歌一般的劲儿多是坚强有力或者活泼愉快，能代表出集体的力来。不宜唱得太慢或太弱，否则就容易把歌唱失败。
    二、拿准调头。现在大兵团作战，很多连队在一起的时候是常有的事情，一唱起来，参差不齐，调门各异，唱起来难听，指挥起来费劲，更不能表现出一个统一的整体力量来。因此这也是一个很重要的问题。这也是教歌者应注意的一项，除了教唱人自己把调头唱准以外，还要他使大家都能唱准。有些人教歌一句句的教，大家跟着唱，错了也不纠正，等把歌唱熟了就更难改口了。我感觉学唱歌主要的是靠耳朵，听准调门就易唱准，否则根本唱不准。我们试验了个新方法，即是教歌的人在教前多唱给战士听，把劲也唱出来，这样很容易感染大家的情绪，唱两三遍后，可征求大家对歌的意见，问一问好听不好听，不好听的话可能是编的不好，或者是教者没唱出劲来，可先不教。如好听的话，便可读讲歌词给战士听，使战士听了除曲调印象之外，还留有字音大意的印象。这也更易帮他拿准调，讲完再唱，唱他十遍八遍都没关系，直到战士们有了些印象时再开始一句一句的教。这样做可以唱准调门而实际更是节省时间的。这样教歌的人一定要拉下脸皮，勇气百倍的不怕麻烦的来教才行。
    或者先在下面教几个积极分子（唱歌好一点的）利用少数积极分子在队前反复表演，加强大家的印象。
    这点滴意见只供大家研究参考。
