　　Chapter Seven: A Gold Chain (Continued 2)
　　The little boy was scared, his hands trembling. The rope loosened, and the fat man struggled and rolled off the kang. Zhang Jinlong quickly stepped on his chest and tossed a rope end to the little boy, taking the other end himself. They both pulled hard; the fat-headed, big-brained chairman's eyes rolled upwards, his tongue stuck out, and his body shrunk, curling up into a ball.
　　Zhang Jinlong then released his hold, rushed over, took out the jewelry box, opened it, and saw a glittering gold chain inside. Zhang Jinlong had sharp eyes! He quickly stuffed the box into his chest and said to the little boy, "Knife!"
　　The little boy pulled out a shiny butcher knife from his coat, but didn't dare to strike. Zhang Jinlong glared and snatched the knife, bent down, and stabbed the fat neck. The head didn't come off, and when he pulled the knife out, blood splattered all over him. Two more strikes, and he chopped the head off. He pulled a quilt from the kang, tore off the lining, put the head inside, rolled it diagonally, and wrapped the ends around his waist. He blew out the lamp, closed the door, and the three of them, carrying their guns, ran out the back door.
　　They reached the embankment and squatted down in a secluded spot. Zhang Jinlong took out the roll of bills, and the three of them divided it. The little boy, with a sly look, said, "Big brother, can you give us the two rings, and you keep the gold chain? Is that okay?" Zhang Jinlong spread out his five fingers and slapped him on the face, cursing, "Get the hell out of here! You motherfucker, you're pissing upwards and splashing my face! I told you to kill a dead man, and you didn't even dare to do that. What do you think you are? Still asking for this and that!" The little boy saw he'd turned angry and didn't dare to say a word.
　　But who doesn't have their own little scheme? Li Liu Zi, hearing about the valuable things, smiled and said, "Big brother, don't be angry; let's see what you got!" Zhang Jinlong said, "Don't listen to his bullshit; there are just two rings. Here! Take one!" Li Liu Zi got a ring and shut up. Zhang Jinlong said, "Let's go back, tuck your tails between your legs – don't let anyone see anything!"
　　The three of them hurried back to the district, and it was already dawn. Shuangxi and the others had just gotten up when they suddenly saw Zhang Jinlong running in covered in blood, asking, "Where's Lao Cai?" Shuangxi said, "He didn't stay here. Where did you three go last night?" Zhang Jinlong didn't answer but untied the bundle from his waist, and with a shake, a bloody head rolled to the edge of the kang, scaring everyone.
　　Zhang Jinlong, looking smug, pointed and said, "Look, this is the head of the traitor Liu Kaitang! Zhang Jinlong didn't break a sweat and brought him here in no time. Who doesn't know that the place is surrounded by water, the city walls are so high, and there are devils guarding everywhere, with searchlights flashing from the watchtowers. How could Zhang Jinlong dare to go in? Niu Dashui is good at talking pretty, tell him to go get a head and try it! Humph!"
　　Shuangxi, wide-eyed, asked, "Which Liu Kaitang?" Zhang Jinlong said, "Humph, the town's chamber of commerce chairman, a big traitor, don't you even know that?" Shuangxi felt that this thing was not done appropriately and did not know what to say for a moment, so he told him to rest first, saying that Lao Cai would be back soon. Zhang Jinlong, thinking he had performed a great service, sold his advantage, and kicked the head triumphantly, saying, "Wait until Lao Cai sees it. Tomorrow at the market, hang this traitor's head up so the people can see it." With that, he wrapped up the head and carried it away like a treasure.

　　Six

　　Shuangxi noticed that half of the little boy's face was swollen, which he found strange. He secretly called him away and questioned him slowly. The little boy didn't dare to speak, but Shuangxi assured him that he would be fine and persuaded him with kind words, and he poured out all his grievances.
　　Hei Lao Cai arrived, and Shuangxi reported the underlying situation to him. Lao Cai felt that Zhang Jinlong's ideological problem was very serious and immediately called him in for a private conversation. Zhang Jinlong was still boasting, but Lao Cai frowned and said, "You went out with people without going through the leadership yesterday, that's wrong in the first place. Killing a person is not a small matter, you should have gotten approval from the county and district beforehand; without that decision from above, how could you take it upon yourself to kill someone?"
　　Hearing this, Zhang Jinlong said resentfully, "Was I wrong to kill such a big traitor?" Hei Lao Cai said, "The chairman of a chamber of commerce is not necessarily a big traitor. We Communists mainly strive to win over and educate these kinds of people; we only suppress those who are extremely wicked and cannot be won over. Indiscriminately killing people without regard for the severity of their crimes is not allowed!" Zhang Jinlong hit a snag, choked down a breath, and sat there rolling his eyes. Hei Lao Cai looked at him with dissatisfaction and asked, "What exactly did you do this for? Was it for the resistance against Japan? Or for yourself? ... Tell me, what did you get when you went to town this time?"
　　At this question, Zhang Jinlong's face changed, turning red and white, and he said, "What is going on here? I didn't even touch a button on them! Where did you hear that?" Lao Cai saw his glib tongue and lies and was very angry, but he patiently said to him, "Jinlong, our pursuit of this matter is not about craving your little bit of stuff, but mainly about correcting your thinking. Yesterday, Shuangxi and I talked to you for so long, but you didn't reflect at all, and instead, you're getting worse and worse. Like you, only thinking about yourself, you are only harmful to the revolution, not helpful; even for yourself, if you don't correct these mistakes, and they continue to develop day by day, you will be ruined!"
　　Zhang Jinlong could not save face on his face, and thought in his heart: "It must be Niu Dashui who badmouthed me behind my back!" He became angry and jumped three feet high and said, "I can't do this job! Putting my life on the line to do it, and doing it and doing it, I still get nothing, there must be something wrong here! I know who is attacking me from behind! If it wasn't for your face, I would have shot him with a gun. Today, let's open the window and speak frankly, if there is Niu Dashui, there is no me, if there is me, there is no Niu Dashui! Who doesn't have two legs? Anyway, I won't surrender to the enemy, I won't be a traitor, I'll go home and be an ordinary person!" Saying that, he slammed the box cannon on the table, turned and left. Just as Niu Dashui came in, Zhang Jinlong, with a murderous look on his face, didn't even look at him, and walked out with his neck straight.
　　He returned to the class and pointed and scolded. He fanned the flames with those sworn brothers who had burned incense with him. Li Liu Zi led them all to find Hei Lao Cai to hand over their guns, and the little boy dared not not follow. Hei Lao Cai and the comrades from the district committee talked to them separately, persuading and educating them from all aspects, and in the end they all stayed; only Li Liu Zi didn't listen and said, "I can't eat this bowl of rice, whoever wants to do it can do it!" He dropped his gun, got on his bicycle and left.
　　At this time, Xiaomei was coaxing the child. The child was very sick, crying and making noise. Xiaomei held him, patted him, sang to him, and walked around the room. The child was so thin that he looked like a monkey. Xiaomei felt a pang of pain in her heart. Walking in front of the mirror, Xiaomei pointed and said, "Look! Who is in here?" The skinny, monkey-like child laughed, and Xiaomei couldn't help but shed tears.
　　The egg was steamed. Xiaomei held the child and fed him. Suddenly Zhang Jinlong rushed in fiercely and said, "Yang Xiaomei, if you are my wife, immediately roll up your bedding and leave with me! If you are not my wife, let's break up!" Xiaomei was stunned, her eyes wide open like two small copper bells, saying, "What are you doing?" Zhang Jinlong sneered and said, "People are making me feel like neither a human nor a ghost, I'm not doing it anymore! There's plenty of places for me to work! If you want to follow me, you immediately quit your job; if you want to work, let's break up!"
　　Xiaomei's hands and feet were cold with anger, and she opened her eyes wide and said, "Zhang Jinlong, don't threaten me! Let's break up! Can I give up the revolution and follow you? Let's go our separate ways and not interfere with each other!" Zhang Jinlong said fiercely, "Okay, you have guts! If you don't acknowledge me, then don't want this child!" Saying that, he came to snatch Xiaoshou.
　　Xiaoshou cried out. Xiaomei held him tightly and anxiously said, "The child is so sick, don't scare him!" Zhang Jinlong grabbed Xiaoshou's armpits with both hands and pulled hard, and Xiaomei fell to the ground. Zhang Jinlong kicked her hard, and holding Xiaoshou, he left. He slammed the door shut. Xiaomei climbed up and chased after him. But this guy played the rogue, bolted the door. Xiaomei was so anxious that she smashed and shouted. Xiaoshou used all his strength to cry for his mother, and his voice faded away.
　　After Zhang Jinlong returned, he sent a letter to the county saying that marrying a wife was for living a life, and if Yang Xiaomei didn't want to come home, it was better to divorce her sooner rather than later. The county solicited Xiaomei's opinion, and Xiaomei said, "I've exhausted my heart for him. This person's roots are not right, and he is crooked, and insists on abandoning the revolution! I really can't live with him anymore. I have no objection to the divorce, but the child must be given to me, following him will not be good!" The county gave the two of them divorce procedures; but the child Xiaoshou was snatched away by Zhang Jinlong, and he caught a cold on the road, his illness worsened, and he died in a few days.

  　第七回　一条金链子（续二）
    小小子心里害怕，手发抖，绳子一松，胖子就挣扎着从炕上滚下来。张金龙急忙一脚踩住他的胸脯儿，把一个绳头子撂给小小子，自己拿一头，两下里使劲一拉；那肥头胖脑的会长，眼珠子就翻上去，舌头就伸出来，身子越抽越小，卷缩在一块儿了。
    张金龙这才松了手，忙跑去，拿出手饰盒，打开一看，里面黄烁烁的是一条金链子。张金龙好眼亮啊！赶忙连盒儿塞在怀里，对小小子说：“刀！”
    小小子从袄里抽出雪亮亮的杀猪刀，可是不敢下手。张金龙瞪着眼儿夺过刀，弯下腰去，一刀砍在那胖脖子上；头没卸下来，一抽刀，血就彪了他一身。又两下，把头切下了。从炕上拉过一条被子，扯下被里儿，把人头放在里面，斜对角一卷，两头缠在腰里。吹了灯，关了门，三个人提了枪，从后门跑了。
    到了堤上，找个地方蹲下来。张金龙掏出那卷票子，三个人分了分。小小子涎着脸儿说：“大哥，你把那两个戒指给我们俩，你留着金链子，不行啊？”张金龙揸开五个手指头，拍的给他一耳光，骂着：“滚你妈的蛋！你他妈的仰八脚儿撒尿，溅到我的脸上来啦！叫你杀个死人，你都不敢杀，你算老几？还要这要那哩！”小小子一看他翻了脸，吓得一声不敢言语。
    可是谁肚子里没个小九九呀？李六子听说有值钱的东西，就笑着说：“大哥，你别生气；什么东西拿出来瞧瞧！”张金龙说：“别听他放狗屁，就是有两个戒指。来！给你一个！”李六子得了戒指，就算了。张金龙说：“咱们回去，屁股后头掖手巾——可别露了眼子！”
    三个人奔回区上，天也亮了。双喜他们刚起来，忽然看见张金龙满身是血的跑进来，问：“老蔡呢？”双喜说：“他没宿在这儿。昨天夜里，你们三个到哪儿去了？”张金龙也不答话，就从腰里解下包袱，一抖开，一颗血淋淋的人头便碌碌滚到炕边，把大家吓了一跳。
    张金龙神气活现的指着说：“瞧吧，这是汉奸刘开堂的脑袋！我张金龙不费吹灰的力量，一时三刻就把他弄来了。谁不知道，那儿四面是水，城墙老么高，到处都有鬼子把守，岗楼上手电打得一闪闪的，我张金龙怎么就敢进去呀？牛大水倒会说漂亮话，叫他也去弄个人头来试试！吓！”
    双喜睁大眼睛问：“哪个刘开堂？”张金龙说：“哼，镇上的商会会长，大汉奸，你还不知道？”双喜心里觉得这件事儿干得不准合适，一时也不好说什么，就叫他先去歇息，说老蔡一会儿就来了。张金龙自以为立了个大功，得了便宜卖了乖，得意的踢着人头说：“回头叫老蔡瞧瞧。赶明儿集上，把这个汉奸脑袋挂出去，叫老百姓也都知道知道。”说着，包起人头，象个宝贝似的提着走了。
    六
    双喜发现小小子半个脸儿肿了，很奇怪，就秘密的把他叫去，慢慢儿盘问他。小小子不敢说，双喜保证他没事，又用好话一劝，他才气囊囊的把一肚子话都倒了出来。
    黑老蔡来了，双喜把底子里的情形报告给他。老蔡觉得张金龙的思想问题很严重，马上找他来单独谈话。张金龙还了不起的吹呢，老蔡可皱着眉头说：“昨天你没有通过上级，就带着人跑出去，这头一桩你就不对。杀一个人，可不是个小问题，事先就应该得到县区的批准；上面没这个决定，你怎么能自己做主杀人呢？”
    张金龙听了，忿忿不平的说：“这么个大汉奸难道我杀错了？”黑老蔡说：“一个商会会长未必就是个大汉奸。我们共产党，对这类人主要是争取、教育；要镇压，只能镇压罪大恶极，争取不过来的。不分轻重的乱杀人可不允许！”张金龙碰了个钉子，蹩着一口气，翻起白眼坐在那里。黑老蔡不满意的看着他，又问：“你干这一手，究竟为了什么？是为抗日吗？还是为自己？……你说，你这次到镇上去，弄了些什么东西？”
    这一问，张金龙脸色就变了，红一阵，白一阵的，说：“这是怎么回事？我连人家的一个扣子都没动！你这话从哪儿说起？”老蔡看他油腔滑调，满嘴胡说，心里很生气，可是还耐着性子对他说：“金龙，我们追究你这个事儿，并不是稀罕你这点儿东西，主要是纠正你的思想。昨天我和双喜跟你谈了那么久，你可一点反省也没有，反而越闹越不象样子了。象你这样一切为个人打算，对革命只有害处，没有好处；就是对你自己来说，要不改正这些错误，一天天发展下去，也非毁了你不行！”
    张金龙脸上早挂不住了，心里想：“准是牛大水背地里出我的坏！”他恼羞成怒，一跳三尺高的说：“这活儿我干不成了！这么泼出命去干，干来干去还落个不好，这里头一定有鬼！谁在背后打击我，我也知道！要不是看着你的面子，我早拿枪崩了他了。今儿个咱们打开窗子说亮话，有牛大水就没有我，有我就没有牛大水！谁没带着两条腿呀？反正我也不投敌，我也不当汉奸，我回家当老百姓去！”说着，把盒子枪往桌上一撂，转身就走。刚好牛大水进来，张金龙一脸杀气，眼皮子了也不了，直着脖子走出去了。
    他回到班上，就指手划脚的骂。把那些和他捻过香的把兄弟，都扇起了火。李六子领着，一齐来找黑老蔡交枪，小小子也不敢不跟着。黑老蔡和区委上的同志，分别和他们谈话，从各方面说服教育，结果都留下了；只有李六子听也不听，说：“这碗饭我吃不了，谁愿意干谁干去！”丢下枪，骑着车子就走了。
    这当儿，小梅正在哄孩子。孩子小瘦病得很厉害，哭一阵，闹一阵。小梅抱着他，拍着，唱着，在屋里走来走去。孩子瘦得不成样儿啦，小梅心里一阵阵的疼。走到镜子跟前，小梅指着说：“看！这里面是谁？”瘦得猴儿似的孩子笑了，小梅的眼泪忍不住掉了下来。
    鸡蛋蒸熟了。小梅抱着孩子，喂他吃呢。忽然张金龙气凶凶的进来说：“杨小梅，你要是我的老婆，马上卷起铺盖跟我走！不是我的老婆，咱俩就一刀两断！”小梅楞住了，眼睛瞪得象两只小铜铃，说：“你这是干什么呀？”张金龙冷笑说：“人家把我弄得人不人鬼不鬼的，我不干了！此处不养爷的，自有养爷处。你要跟着我，你马上脱离工作；你要工作，咱俩就拉倒！”
    小梅气得手脚冰凉，睁圆着眼儿说：“张金龙，你别威吓我！拉倒就拉倒！我还能撂下革命跟你走啊？咱们车走车道，马走马路，谁也不跟谁相干！”张金龙发狠的说：“好，你有种！你不认我，你也别要这孩子！”说着就来夺小瘦。
    小瘦哇的哭起来了。小梅紧紧抱住不放，着急的说：“孩子病得这样，你别吓着他呀！”张金龙两只手卡住小瘦的膈肢窝，用劲一拉，小梅就扑倒在地上。张金龙狠狠的踢了她一脚，抱着小瘦就走。随手乒的把门关上。小梅爬起来就追。可是这家伙耍流氓，把门扣上了。急得小梅乱砸乱喊。小瘦使大劲儿嚎着叫妈妈，声音越去越远了。
    张金龙回去以后，给县上捎信说，娶媳妇是为了过日子，杨小梅要不回家，不如趁早儿离婚。县上征求小梅的意见，小梅说：“我为他心都使碎了。这个人根不正，秧子歪，偏要脱离革命！我跟他实在没法过下去。离婚我没意见，可是孩子得断给我，跟着他没个好！”县上给他两个办了离婚手续；可是孩子小瘦给张金龙抢去，路上冒了风寒，病一加重，几天就死了。
