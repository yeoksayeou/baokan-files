Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 28th -- United Press reported on the 23rd: British trade has deteriorated since the first quarter of this year. The US dollars obtained from the Marshall Plan are not enough to fill Britain's trade deficit. Britain's trade deficit in the second quarter seems to be much larger than in the first quarter. Britain originally had about two billion US dollars in liquid assets, but in the past few months, this fund has been used to cover the serious deficit. According to Reuters, the British deficit in May was as high as 37.8 million pounds, and in April it was 44.6 million pounds, more than double the average monthly trade deficit of 21 million pounds in the first quarter. It is reported that the surge in Britain's deficit and trade deficit is the result of the United States further seizing Britain's overseas markets.

　　美夺取英市场结果
  　英入超激增
    【新华社北平二十八日电】合众社二十三日讯：英国贸易自今年第一季即开始恶化，从马歇尔计划中所获得的美元，不足以填补英国贸易的逆差。英国在第二季中的入超，似乎比第一季远大得多。英国本来保有约二十亿美元的流动资金，但在过去几个月中，这笔资金已经用在填补严重的赤字上。另据路透社消息，英国五月份赤字高达三千七百八十万镑，四月份则为四千四百六十万镑，超过第一季平均每月入超二千一百万镑的一倍以上。据悉，英国赤字和贸易入超激增，系美国进一步夺取英国海外市场的结果。
