　　Strengthening Unified Leadership of the Municipal Labor Movement
  　Beijing Municipality Adjusts Trade Union Structure
  　District Trade Unions Abolished and Replaced with Offices
    [Our Newspaper] To adapt to the needs of urban work and strengthen the leadership of the workers' movement, the Preparatory Committee of the Beijing Municipal Federation of Trade Unions convened a meeting of the directors of district trade unions yesterday (28th) to discuss organizational structure issues. After a day of discussion, it was decided to abolish the district trade union organizations and replace them with offices. The offices will have a director, secretary, and four work groups for publicity, organization, industrial workers, handicraft workers, transport workers, and shop employees. To strengthen the leadership of workers in suburban areas, the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions has also established a Suburban Trade Union Working Committee. The task of the offices is to assist in mediating labor-capital disputes, educating workers, and raising their class consciousness under the unified leadership of the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions, so as to strengthen the workers' awareness as masters and ensure the completion of various work plans of the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions. Currently, in addition to actively improving their structures, each office has determined its work focus to be: organizing workers according to different industries and establishing trade unions. The method and steps for establishment are from top to bottom, first establishing municipal industry trade unions, and then establishing district branches as needed, overcoming the work style of being tied down. Secondly, mediating labor-capital disputes is also one of the current work priorities. On this issue, Comrade Xiao Ming of the Preparatory Committee of the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions pointed out that there had been a "leftist" deviation of workers making excessive demands, which had been promptly pointed out and is being corrected. However, in the process of correction, there are sprouts of "rightism," which should be given attention. Currently, both "leftist" and "rightist" tendencies exist simultaneously. Finally, regarding worker education, the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions will continue to hold worker training classes, and each office should make good use of the opportunity for university and middle school students to go to districts and factories during the summer vacation to hold summer training classes and worker night schools, etc. (Tian)

　　加强全市工运统一领导
  　平市调整工会机构
  　区工会取消改设办事处
    【本报讯】为适应城市工作需要，加强工人运动的领导，平市总工会筹委会于昨（二十八）日召集各区工会主任会议，讨论组织机构问题。经一日讨论，决定取消各区工会组织，改设办事处。办事处设主任、秘书、宣传、组织及产业工人、手工业工人、运输工人、店员工人等四个工作组。为了加强郊区工人领导，市总工会并设立郊区工会工作委员会。办事处的任务是在市总工会统一领导下协助调解劳资纠纷，教育工人，提高其阶级觉悟，以加强工人主人翁的自觉和保证市总工会各种工作计划的完成。目前各办事处除积极健全机构外，并确定工作重点是：按不同行业组织工人，成立工会。成立的方式和步骤是从上到下，先建立市的行业工会，然后看需要建立各区的分会，克服束手束脚的工作作风。其次，调解劳资纠纷也是目前工作重点之一。在此问题上，市总工会筹委会萧明同志指出曾发生过工人要求过高的左的偏向，已经及时指出并正在纠正。但在纠正过程中又有右的萌芽，应引起警惕。目前左右两种偏向是同时存在的。最后是工人教育问题，市总工会将继续举办工人训练班，各办事处应很好利用大中学生暑假到区到工厂工作的机会举办暑假训练班与工人夜校等。（田）
