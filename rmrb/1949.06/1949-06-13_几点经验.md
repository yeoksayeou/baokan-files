　　A Few Experiences
    A few experiences in leadership: (1) In leadership, it is necessary to seize the season, take the initiative to carry out shock work, and never wait for rain or rely on heaven, and break the masses' mentality of relying on heaven. (2) It is necessary to clearly affirm the task, and the leadership must express its attitude, determination, and confidence, so that lower-level cadres have a goal to strive for, which is a necessary condition for completing the task. (3) It is imperative to rely on the branch, and rely on the backbone, core, and leading role of party members. (4) Large-scale mobilization, launching mass-based competition campaigns, and timely use of blackboards, loudspeakers, bulletins, and newsletters to commend models and typical examples, disseminate experience, encourage them to complete and exceed tasks, and promptly criticize backwardness, and point out the direction of efforts. (5) It is imperative to carry out the task all the way down to the production team or each household, and promote team leaders and the masses to hold meetings for discussion, in order to set off a mass movement.

　　几点经验
    领导上的几点经验：（一）领导上要抓紧季节，主动的进行突击，决不能等雨靠天，并打破群众靠天思想。（二）要明确肯定任务，领导上表明态度与决心信心，使下级干部有奋斗目标，是完成任务的必要条件。（三）必须依靠支部、依靠党员的骨干、核心、带头、作用。（四）大规模的动员，发起群众性的竞赛运动，及时的用黑板报、广播筒、通报、简报、来表扬模范、典型，传播经验，鼓励他们完成与超过任务，并及时的批评落后，指出努力的方向。（五）必须把任务一直贯彻到生产小组或每户中去，推动小组长和群众开会讨论，才能掀起群众运动。（冀南三地委办公室卢少田）
