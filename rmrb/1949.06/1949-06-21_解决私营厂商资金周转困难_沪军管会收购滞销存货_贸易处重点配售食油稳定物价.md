Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 20th: To resolve the funding difficulties experienced by private factories due to the slow sales of finished products, the Trade Department of the Finance and Economics Takeover Committee of the Shanghai Military Control Commission began purchasing some finished products from factories on the 1st of this month. This purchasing operation temporarily concluded on the 9th. During the acquisition period, a continuous stream of manufacturers applied for the acquisition; the peak reached over 140 applications per day. Over the nine days, the agency purchased inventory from 322 factories. All factories immediately received full payment. Private manufacturers praised the People's Government's considerate care and efficient handling of production support. Shanghai's well-known Zhengtai Rubber Factory, urgently needing funds, requested that the General Manager Hong Fumei ask the agency to purchase 500 Double Coin brand heavy-duty truck tires (inner and outer). At the time, the market price of each tire was only 40,000 RMB, but the applied price was 64,720 RMB. After negotiations between General Manager Hong and the agency, they agreed to compromise between the fixed price and the market price at 50,000 RMB per tire. However, after repeated consideration, in order to take care of the factory's difficulties and the cost of the tires, the agency finally purchased them at the applied price of 64,720 RMB. Furthermore, Da'an Textile Factory applied to sell 32-count Golden Bull yarn, with each piece transacted at 320,000 RMB; the next morning, when payment was made, the price of this yarn had risen to 370,000 RMB due to the influence of silver dollar speculators in the Shanghai market. After the factory applied, the agency did not adhere to the established practice of fixed transactions and still paid 370,000 RMB per piece, according to the market price.

Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 20th: In order to regulate the supply of cooking oil and stabilize prices in Shanghai, the Trade Department of the Shanghai Military Control Commission has decided to have the Shanghai office of the China Vegetable Oil Company distribute cooking oil on a prioritized basis once a month starting in June. All Shanghai garrison troops, government agency employees, social education institutions, teachers and staff of public elementary schools and above, workers, boarding students, employees of public factories and taken-over enterprises, and others specially approved by the Military Control Commission are eligible to apply for oil rations. Each person is entitled to one *jin* (500g) per distribution, excluding family members.

    解决私营厂商资金周转困难
    沪军管会收购滞销存货
    贸易处重点配售食油稳定物价
    【新华社上海二十日电】沪市军管会财经接管委员会贸易处代理部，为解决私营厂商因成品滞销而发生的资金周转困难，曾于本月一日起收购各厂的部分成品，此项收购工作已于九日暂告一段落。收购期间，每日申请收购的厂商川流不息，最多时申请书日达一百四十余件。九天中代理部共收购了三百二十二家厂商的存货。各厂商都立即得到全部货款。私营厂商对人民政府扶助生产事业的体贴照顾及办事迅速，无不赞佩。上海著名的正泰橡胶厂，因需款甚急，曾由该厂洪福楣总经理向代理部要求收购回力牌载重车胎（内外胎）五百只，当时此种车胎每只市价仅人民币四万元，而申请价格为六万四千七百二十元。经洪总经理与代理部协议按定价与市价折中为每只五万元。但代理部经再三考虑后，为照顾该厂的困难及车胎的成本，终于依照六万四千七百二十元的申请价收买。又大安纺织厂申请收购三十二支金牛纱，每件以三十二万元成交；次日上午交款时，因当时沪市物价受银元投机商的影响，此种纱每件已涨至三十七万元。经该厂申请后，代理部并不因成交既定的常规，仍照市价三十七万元一件纱价付款。
    【新华社上海二十日电】沪市军管会贸易处为调节食油供应，稳定物价，顷决定自六月份起由中国植物油料厂上海办事处每月有重点地配售食油一次。凡上海市各警卫部队、各政府机关员工、各社教机关及公立小学以上学校教职员、工役及住校学生、各公营工厂职工与各接管企业部门员工，以及其他经军管会特准许可配售者，均可申请配油。每人每次一市斤，但不包括其家属在内。
