　　Beiping Municipal People's Government Bureaus and Offices Strictly Economize on Electricity and Office Expenses

　　[Our Newspaper] Responding to the call of the North China People's Government to practice thrift, the Beiping Municipal People's Government's bureaus and offices are strictly practicing economy. Since June, the Municipal Government Office and the four departments of Secretariat, Personnel, Administration, and News have cancelled all public and private electric stoves. They have also replaced forty-four unnecessary light bulbs of 60 watts or more with smaller light bulbs, and are continuing to inspect light bulbs in various offices. In the past, office supplies such as red-lined paper, stationery, envelopes, ink, and paste were all purchased. Since April, the Municipal Government has been using woodcut stencils and waste paper to produce them in-house, saving more than 24,000 yuan per month. The Finance Bureau and the Construction Bureau have stipulated that all lights must be turned off by 10 pm every night, except in special circumstances; the Chief of the First Section of the Construction Bureau personally inspects this. They also plan to reduce the number of internal telephone extensions soon. The Finance Bureau saved 80,000 yuan in office expenses in each of April and May, accounting for more than 50% of the bureau's monthly office expenses. The economy movement is now being further promoted in various bureaus and offices.

　　北平市人民政府各局处严格节省用电和办公费
    【本报讯】北平市人民政府各局、处响应华北人民政府号召，厉行节约。市府办公室和秘书、人事、行政、新闻等四处，自六月份起就把所有公私电炉一律取消。并把四十四个不必要的六十支光以上的灯泡换为小灯泡，现在仍继续检查各处灯泡。过去办公用的红格纸、信纸、信封、墨水、浆糊等，都是购买的，自四月份起，市府就利用木刻模、废纸等，由工友自己印制。每月节省二万四千余元。财政局、建设局并规定除有特殊事故外，每晚十时一律熄灯；建设局第一科科长并亲自检查。同时他们计划最近减少局内电话分机。财政局在四、五两月份办公费中各节省八万元，占该局每月办公费的百分之五十以上。现在各局处正深入推进节约运动。
