　　Nine Hundred Thousand People Mobilized to Eradicate Locust Nymphs in Taihang with Victory
　　[Taihang Electric] The Taihang locust eradication has concluded victoriously. In early June, locust nymphs were successively discovered in 2,800-plus administrative villages in 26 counties, including Shahe, Xinxiang, and Anyang in the Taihang First (Western Hebei), Fourth, and Fifth Northern Henan Special Districts, accounting for approximately one-third of the entire region. According to statistics from the nine counties of the Fifth Special District alone, the affected area reached 1.5 million mu. The density of locust nymphs in the affected areas was generally 20 to 50 per square step, with denser areas reaching over 200, and exceptional cases exceeding 600. Under the leadership of Party committees and governments at all levels, the masses extensively applied and leveraged their past two locust eradication experiences, launching a large-scale locust eradication campaign, with a total participation of over 900,000 people (excluding the Fourth Special District). Workers, merchants, doctors, and troops, government offices, and schools in some areas also joined the locust eradication movement. The Pengcheng Sanxin Textile Factory in Ci County, workers voluntarily sacrificed their Sunday rest to help farmers fight locusts. Medical assistants and nurses from the Zhangbin Hospital in the Fifth Special District also appeared on the locust eradication front, fighting locusts while treating the masses involved in the eradication effort. The locust eradication command posts in the Fifth District of Wu'an and Anyang County specifically organized doctors to manufacture large quantities of emergency medicine to prevent disease and ensure the health of the masses fighting locusts. After 18 days of intense fighting, the locust nymphs in various villages have been basically completely eliminated, saving nearly 140,000 mu of seedlings. During the movement, a large number of Party and non-Party women, youth models, and activists emerged, ensuring the rapid and victorious conclusion of this locust eradication effort. For example, in Xiuwu County, after participating in the spring river management movement, nearly 10,000 women participated in locust eradication, playing a significant role. The Taihang District Committee Office of the Communist Party of China specifically issued a locust eradication communique on the 24th of this month, celebrating the victory, calling on leaders at all levels to quickly organize the masses to shift to weeding and planting, while also increasing vigilance a hundredfold to prevent the recurrence of locust plagues, and organize women and children to quickly, cleanly, and thoroughly eliminate the remaining locusts.
