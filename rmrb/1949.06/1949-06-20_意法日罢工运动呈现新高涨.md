　　Strike Movements in Italy, France, and Japan Show New Upsurge
    The new upsurge of strike movements and the suppression of strike movements are the characteristics of the workers' movement in some major capitalist countries at present. In Italy, the agricultural workers' strike, which has lasted for nearly a month, has entered the most acute stage. The number of striking workers has increased to two million. Due to the bloody suppression by landlords and police, bloody incidents occur every day. On June 15, 2.5 million workers in various industries in the agricultural areas of Italy also held a 24-hour general strike in support of the striking agricultural workers. Four and a half million workers in Italy went on strike simultaneously in one day, demonstrating the high degree of unity and great strength of the Italian working class. The agricultural workers' strike was caused by economic reasons, but now it has a definite political nature. Vittorio, Secretary-General of the Italian General Confederation of Labor, pointed out: "Under the current situation, the failure of the Italian agricultural proletariat will mean the failure of the entire proletariat, while the victory of the agricultural proletariat will mean the victory of all working people." In France, one million employees of state agencies and enterprises also launched a 24-hour warning strike on the 15th to improve working conditions. The unity of the working class is a prominent feature of this strike. Government employees belonging to the General Confederation of Labor, the Christian Trade Union Confederation, "Workers' Force," and various independent local trade unions, as well as government employees who did not participate in trade unions, all participated in the strike. "L'Humanité" pointed out: "This is a great success." In Japan, the suppression of the labor movement by the American occupiers has recently become increasingly savage. When 3,000 workers of the Hiroshima Japan Steel Company held a strike on the 15th to protest the company's unjustified dismissal of workers, MacArthur Headquarters instructed the Yoshida government to implement armed suppression. Prior to this, MacArthur Headquarters had publicly banned the Japanese coal miners' strike, the Tokyo streetcar workers' strike, and the electric railway strike in Tokyo Prefecture and Kanagawa Prefecture, and on May 29, during the demonstration of Tokyo workers and students against the "New Public Security Law," it condoned the Japanese police in killing Hashimoto Kinjiro, a streetcar worker who participated in the demonstration. This series of actions by the American occupiers, which violated the provisions of the Potsdam Agreement on developing democratic forces in Japan, has aroused the anger of the Japanese people and legitimate condemnation internationally. Japan's most powerful trade union, the Federation of Industrial Labor Unions, has risen to support the Hiroshima steel workers and oppose the Yoshida government's illegal suppression of workers. The Soviet representative to the Allied Council for Japan also protested against MacArthur Headquarters' condoning of the Yoshida government's undermining of the peaceful demonstrations of Japanese workers.

### 意法日罢工运动呈现新高涨

　　意法日罢工运动呈现新高涨
    罢工运动新的高涨以及对罢工运动的镇压，是目前某些主要资本主义国家工人运动的特点。在意大利，坚持将近一月的农业工人罢工，已进入最尖锐的阶段。罢工工人已增至二百万人。由于地主与警察采取血腥的镇压行为，每天都有流血事件发生。六月十五日，全意农业地区二百五十万各业工人，为声援罢工的农业工人，也举行了二十四小时的总罢工。全意大利一天之内有四百五十万工人同时罢工，表现了意大利工人阶级高度的团结与伟大的力量。农业工人的罢工是由于经济原因所引起的，但是，现在已具有确定的政治性质。意大利总工会总书记维特里奥指出：“在目前局势下，意大利农业无产阶级的失败，就将意味着整个无产阶级的失败，而农业无产阶级的胜利，则意味着全体劳动人民的胜利。”在法国，国家机关与企业的一百万雇员，为改善劳动条件亦于十五日发动了二十四小时的警告大罢工。工人阶级的团结一致，是这次罢工的显著标志。属于总工会、基督教职工联盟、“工人力量”与各独立地方工会的政府雇员以及未参加工会的政府雇员，都一起参加了罢工。人道报指出：“这是巨大的成功。”在日本，美国占领者对劳工运动的镇压，最近愈来愈野蛮。当广岛日本钢铁公司三千名工人因抗议厂方无理解雇工人而于十五日举行罢工时，麦克阿瑟总部即指使吉田政府实行武力镇压。在此以前，麦克阿瑟总部曾先后公然出面禁止了日本煤矿工人罢工、东京电车工人罢工、东京县与神奈川县的电气铁道罢工，并在五月二十九日东京工人与学生反对“新治安法”的示威中，纵容日本警察杀害了参加示威的电车工人桥本金次郎。美国占领者这一连串的违反波茨坦协议关于发展日本民主力量规定的行为，已激起日本人民的愤怒与国际上的正当斥责。日本最强大的工会——产业劳动组合联合会，已起而声援广岛钢铁工人，反对吉田政府对工人的非法镇压。苏联出席盟国对日委员会的代表，亦对麦克阿瑟总部之纵容吉田政府破坏日本工人的和平示威，提出抗议。　　　　　　　　（未完）
