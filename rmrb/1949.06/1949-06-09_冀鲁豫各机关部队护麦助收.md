[Ji-Lu-Yu Telegram] To help resolve the difficulties faced by families of revolutionary martyrs and soldiers and people without labor during the wheat harvest, all directly subordinate agencies and troops of the Ji-Lu-Yu region Party, government, military, and civilian armed forces have organized temporary production teams to assist with the wheat harvest in their respective stationed areas. The Military Region Health Department and health education teams organized all available labor and livestock into several teams, and conducted surveys of families of revolutionary martyrs and soldiers and people lacking labor in the villages where they were stationed, providing specific assistance. In four days, they pulled 117 mu of wheat and harvested 21 mu, and also helped with transportation. Due to a shortage of sickles, many people pulled the wheat by hand, and some developed blisters, but their morale was very high. In order to prevent wheat from being stolen, some units also voluntarily organized joint military-civilian armed patrol teams with the masses to maintain the harvest. For example, after Xu Hai discovered wheat theft, the Military Region Health Department production team organized a patrol team with the masses and patrolled up to five li away at night, which was highly praised and appreciated by the villagers. With the active help of the agencies and troops, the wheat near the urban area of Heze has been completely harvested, and the threshing grounds are full of piles of wheat. A large expanse of land after the wheat harvest is awaiting another sowing.

[Ji-Lu-Yu Telegram] The Ji-Lu-Yu Daily published an editorial calling for the protection of wheat, pointing out three things: (1) The illegal activities of a small number of idlers who do not engage in honest work, such as military ruffians, hoodlums, and ne'er-do-wells, must be resolutely dealt with, strictly managed, and transformed through forced labor. (2) The sabotage activities of counter-revolutionary elements must be severely suppressed and handed over to the government's judicial and public security departments for legal action. (3) In areas where land reform has not yet been carried out, a small number of poor people and disaster victims who steal wheat due to the pressure of life should also be persuaded and educated, and active efforts should be made to help them engage in production for self-salvation.

　　冀鲁豫各机关部队护麦助收
    【冀鲁豫电】冀鲁豫区党政军民武各直属机关部队，为帮助解决麦收中烈军工属与无劳力群众的困难，组织临时生产组，在各驻地帮助麦收。军区卫生部及卫教队组织所有劳畜力，分成若干小组，并将驻地农村需要帮助的烈军工属与缺乏劳力的群众作了调查，具体帮助。四天拔麦一一七亩，割麦二一亩，且帮助运输。因镰刀少，不少人用手拔，有的手起了泡，但情绪非常高。为了防止麦子被偷，有的单位还自动与群众组织军民武装巡查队。以维护麦收。如徐海发现偷麦后，军区卫生部生产组便与群众组织巡查队，夜里跑到五里以外去巡查，各村群众都很赞扬与感动。在各机关部队积极帮助下菏泽城区附近，麦子已全部收完，场上到处是一堆堆的麦子。一大片麦收后的土地，等待着又一次的播种。
    【冀鲁豫电】冀鲁豫日报发社论号召保麦，指出三点：（１）少数不务正业的游民分子，如兵痞、流氓、二流子等，对他们的非法行为，必须坚决处理，并严加管理，强迫劳动加以改造。（２）反革命分子的破坏活动，必须严加镇压，送政府司法及公安部门法办。（３）在未进行土改地区，少数贫苦群众及灾民，因生活所迫而发生偷麦的事情，对他们也应加以说服教育，并积极想办法使其生产自救。
