    The Brothers
    Lù Fěi

    I.
    Zhang Zhen was a riveter's helper. Everyone in the factory knew him. He was shorter than average, and always worked and spoke slowly and deliberately. The older workers knew his style, but the younger ones thought he was too soft and lacked fire. He couldn't get a single word out of his mouth when he met the foreman. Logically speaking, in the old society, such an honest and stuttering person should have had an easier life than those "rebellious" workers, right? To be more precise, he should have been better off than his brother Zhang Zhu, right? But that wasn't necessarily the case. As his brother often said, "You work like an ox or a horse, and what have you got to show for it? You've been a riveter for thirty years, and you're still just a helper?" When Zhang Zhen heard this, he just sighed and let it go. In those days, skill didn't matter. Hard work was even less important.
    Speaking of Zhang Zhen's skills, thirty years of riveting meant he had the work down cold; he really knew his stuff. When he worked, even though he was skinny, his arms were like iron chains; when he swung the three-and-a-half-pound hammer, he wasn't weak. He had only one flaw, and that was in front of those who put on airs and looked down on others, he turned into a puddle, humming and hawing, unable to say a few no's. He couldn't boast, couldn't flatter, and wouldn't send gifts with a tea package, so he still only earned twenty-one yuan base pay.
    His brother, Zhang Zhu, was half his age, but earned thirty-four yuan and twenty cents. Based on skill, he should have earned that much; based on his bull-like energy, he was lucky not to get "fired." But he was doing well. Why? It was because of the two fists he used to beat his way through that society.
    The brothers were very different in temperament, even though they were equally good at their work. The older brother was taciturn; the younger brother was lively and energetic. When told to do something, he would roll up his sleeves and get right to it. When the boss came to give instructions, he always twisted his neck, as if he owed him two measures of rice; but after the boss left, the work was never wrong. But he was easily angered, and in that old society, he couldn't stand anything. He would curse if tools weren't put in the right place, and he would curse when he saw the bigwigs eating, drinking, and making merry.
    Once, some official from the Kuomintang Railway Bureau came to the factory to inspect the "starving workers." When they arrived, they put on quite a show. When they entered the factory, every worker was sitting down, and no one nodded or bowed to them. He walked up to Zhang Zhu, who still had his legs crossed, but his eyes were boring into him. The bastard's face turned green with anger. In the end, he still had to obediently approve the expenses.
    So Zhang Zhu often said to his brother, "Those bastard turtles carry canes with 'waist hardness' (pistols) inside, and they think they're so tough; only if you show them some color will they know that we workers are not to be trifled with!" When Zhang Zhen heard this, he always said the same few words: "You haven't tasted that flavor yet! Demotions, 'firing,' a family of several people to feed, we're all in their hands, what can we do?"
    Zhang Zhu didn't have a thoughtful mind, nor the patience to get to the bottom of things, so he just disagreed with his brother. And Zhang Zhen? He always thought his brother was just a kid—after all, his brother was about the same age as his own son, and in his eyes, no matter how old he got, he was still a child. Aside from worrying that his brother would get into trouble at the factory, he never really argued with him about anything else.
    It was back when Zhang Zhen's father was fired by the Japanese that they opened up a third of an acre of riverbank land by the river. A few years later, his father died, and the burden fell on Zhang Zhen's shoulders. He would put down the hammer and pick up the hoe, constantly working without rest.
    His mother felt sorry for Zhang Zhen, and his wife naturally felt even more sorry for her husband. The mother-in-law and daughter-in-law agreed that when they earned a little money, they would buy Zhang Zhen four ounces of wine and cook some dishes, giving them to him in secret from Zhang Zhu. The mother was afraid that her younger son would say she was biased—after all, all ten fingers are connected to the heart, but the eldest son was born weak, and the family relied on him for work, so he was more pitiable; the wife was also afraid of being called unvirtuous, and since her younger brother-in-law earned more than her husband, she felt a bit guilty for only thinking of her husband. So the mother and daughter-in-law kept it a secret!
    But a family living together so closely, there are no airtight walls. Once, Zhang Zhu found out, and it caused a huge uproar, making everyone uneasy. Zhang Zhen was so angry that he wanted to beat his brother, but his brother wouldn't let him, picking up whatever he could find and throwing it, shaking the light bulb above their heads. The whole family was crying and weeping, so sad! After that, the brothers would meet like door gods, not speaking to each other face to face.

    II.
    After liberation, the brothers still went their separate ways. Zhang Zhu spent all day at the factory, either working, attending classes, or going to meetings, not coming home until mealtime or late at night. But when he had time off, he would help with chores around the house.
    The mother quietly said to her daughter-in-law, "That wild child, he hasn't been stomping his feet lately. It seems that this era has turned him into a human being?" The sister-in-law also said, "Brother has grown up." Although the mother and sister-in-law said this, they still worried about what he was doing outside, afraid that he would mess something up and lose his job. So the mother often said to Zhang Zhen, "Since the father is dead, the younger brother should listen to the elder brother. You, as the eldest brother, must teach him. I can't control him!"
    Zhang Zhen? Aside from working, he stayed at home. When there were meetings, he would avoid them if he could, and if he couldn't, he would just sit there. Once, he listened to a class and only picked up bits and pieces, something about the working class being the proletariat... He didn't listen any further to what the proletariat was, and he figured that it must mean having no house or land. He was only thinking about himself. He still had a third of an acre of land! He had originally planned to save some money to build a house, so as not to be at the mercy of the landlord, but now he couldn't even think about it. His partners to the left and right, the most ostentatious were those who drove carts early on, selling their strength. Those who earned the least were from the works section, most of whom lived in makeshift shelters. He had this acre of land, so he wasn't like the proletariat! He thought: Now that they're paying with millet, it's more flexible than before. It's enough to eat and drink, so he might as well give the land away, saving a lot of trouble and becoming a thorough proletariat.
    On Sunday, Zhang Zhen really went to the street office, saying that there were too many chores at home and not enough people, and that the Communist Party wouldn't bury talent, and he wanted to work hard. If you do this and that, that's called "jack of all trades, master of none," and can you really do everything perfectly? He asked the street office to take his land and give it to whoever wanted to plant it. The street office didn't understand his intention and didn't reply immediately, so Zhang Zhen walked out on his own.
    Somehow, Zhang Zhen took a detour and went to the riverbank again. Looking at his land, thinking of the melons and vegetables he used to grow, he felt a bit out of sorts. When he got home, he didn't say a word and went to bed.
    A few days later, on Tuesday, there was a heavy rain. At noon, Zhang Zhen came home soaked like a drowned rat, cursing the weather. Just then, his mother was waiting for his brother to come home and wanted him to deliver food to him, which made him even more uncomfortable. But he still held up an umbrella, carried the lunchbox, and walked, slipping and stumbling, with his shoes under his arm.
    When he got to the small bridge at the factory gate, the mud was squelching. To avoid a large cart, he slipped and fell into the ditch, getting mud all over himself. Passersby laughed loudly, and Zhang Zhen was even more speechless. He got up and went to Zhang Zhu's factory. But when he got there, he found no one; he went to the office, but he wasn't there either. His anger grew, and he wished he could throw the lunchbox away and drag his brother over and give him a good beating.
    He wandered around and went back to the factory, where someone finally told him that Zhang Zhu had been transferred to the union. When Zhang Zhen heard this, he was adding fuel to the fire; anyone else would have given up. When he got to the union, he saw his brother come out to greet him. He threw down the lunchbox, kept his face tense, and turned around to leave! Zhang Zhu quickly stopped his brother, thanked him, and explained—explaining that the union had transferred him to help, and today there was a meeting, and it was raining, and he was afraid of delaying official business, so he troubled his brother. When Zhang Zhen heard this, sparks flew: "You know about delaying this and delaying that, but it's my fault for rolling around like a salted duck egg!" Saying this, he walked away, thinking he was in the right. Zhang Zhu said loudly behind him, "This is not like before, I'm also working for everyone!"
    Zhang Zhen felt uneasy when he got home from work that day. While carrying water, he kept a long face, as if he was looking for trouble. In the evening, the mother mumbled under the lamp about Zhang Zhu not coming home all day. Zhang Zhen seized the opportunity to say, "A little brat, going to the union to work, isn't he just pushing his way to the front, trying to take a shortcut! He's not learning about machines, he's learning about these things. In the future--humph! Don't end up like Wu Dalang trying to climb the pole—it'll serve him right if he gets fired!"
    When the mother heard this, she was even more worried. The mother and son said one thing after another, talking about the corruption of the Kuomintang unions in the past, the lawsuits, the union people not working for the workers, and offending people. They also said that although the current union was different, those "three-dynasty veterans" were still pressing down on them? If you do well, the workers like it, but you offend the superiors; if you don't do well, you offend the brothers! For example, if you give a job to someone, those who didn't do it will feel less effort and those who did more still don't want to scold the person who did the work? If you don't say it, you'll be uncomfortable, that won't leave you any good...
    Late at night, Zhang Zhu came home from the union, and his brother and mother scolded him again. Zhang Zhu only replied: "Don't look at people through a sieve! Now workers can't work like that. I'm working for everyone, which is being the master of liberation!" Zhang Zhen said: "The master of liberation? Who is the master? Those 'three-dynasty veterans' are still living large and eating well. I don't see that good people and bad people can still be distinguished." Zhang Zhu said: "You stubborn fool, can things be done well in one day?" Zhang Zhen said: "Done well in one day? It's been almost three months since liberation, so many people have been transferred, but that bastard won't be transferred, and he's still the director!"
    Zhang Zhu returned to his room, tossing and turning, unable to sleep. He knew who his brother was talking about, thinking that he must remind the union the next day.
    A few days later, each union group discussed personnel issues. After the group discussions, there was a general meeting. The general meeting was held in the auditorium. Zhang Zhen listened silently to others speaking. When it came time to vote, he looked around at those on the left, right, front, and back, and his arm was half extended and half retracted. Finally, when they discussed the director in his factory, Zhang Zhu jumped onto the stage and said: "...Let me say something, this is 'gate goods', no skills at all! Nicknamed 'sky spirit cover', he just presses down on us workers to collect money; when he was the old union representative two years ago, he didn't issue enough welfare coal, forcing the workers to sell it to him at a reduced price, and he also forced my brother to sell it to him. Someone like this, he must be fired!" After he finished speaking, everyone applauded. Someone else came to the stage to speak, opposing firing him, saying to be lenient, educate him, and just demote him... Arguing back and forth, Zhang Zhu insisted on his own opinion again and again.
    Zhang Zhen watched the director's nephew standing in front of him, sweating profusely. What his brother said about the director's mistakes was completely right, and he had suffered a lot from him, but the director's nephew was there, how could the news not get out? If he couldn't subdue him with demotion, then he wouldn't let the Zhang family go! Even if he could really stop the momentum, he still couldn't guard against a secret attack!
    The meeting adjourned, and Zhang Zhen and Zhang Zhu met halfway, arguing again in a few words. Zhang Zhen said: "You're letting people use you as a gong, making you an enemy on all sides, you personally offend others, and you still drag me in; you've been held in people's hands for so many years, without ever turning over..." Zhang Zhu said: "It's precisely because you haven't turned over! Now that the workers are the masters, everyone discusses things. Everything is under the leadership of the Communist Party, working for everyone, you can't be afraid of wolves in front and tigers in the back!" After speaking, he shook his arm and went forward.
    From then on, the brothers were door gods again, not speaking to each other when they met.

    III.
    A month later, the director of Zhang Zhen's factory was transferred to a training camp. Zhang Zhen felt much more at ease, thinking that what his brother said and did was somewhat right. Another half month passed, and everyone who previously received a base salary of twenty-one yuan was increased, and Zhang Zhen was no exception. At the same time, there was also a technical exam. Zhang Zhen went to take it, half believing and half doubting. When the announcement came out, he passed the exam and became a craftsman. He was so happy that he went around saying: "Heaven has opened its eyes, the Communist Party really doesn't bury talent!"
    That day happened to be Zhang Zhen's day off. The weather was very hot and humid. A comrade from the street office, running with a sweat-covered head, came to tell him that the students from the People's Revolutionary University were helping the village with spring plowing, and they had also plowed Zhang Zhen's land, and told him to hurry up and sow the seeds, so as not to miss the rain. After saying this, he left without even drinking a glass of water. Zhang Zhen thanked him as he saw him off: "It's really too much trouble!" The comrade said with a smile: "It's nothing! Doing this little thing is not a trouble."
    Zhang Zhen was really moved when he heard this. In the past, in his opinion, no cadre or student would really work for everyone. Today, he had seen it with his own eyes, and they had plowed his land, not eating or drinking. He thought that society had really changed.
    There was a notice on the factory's blackboard: The New Democratic Youth League is launching a road repair project and soliciting employees to participate. Zhang Zhen was the first to sign up, and he actively mobilized others: "Come on, this is for everyone, and for ourselves!" He told the story of falling down on the rainy day again and again. Many riveters participated, repairing it for an hour after get off work every day, and it was all repaired in less than three days.
    On Sunday, Zhang Zhu came home after finishing class, just in time to see Zhang Zhen buying some wine and dishes. He grabbed him, and the brothers sat down to drink together like it was New Year's. The mother said to the daughter-in-law: "The brothers' feelings are right!" Because of this, the whole family was happy and lively. After a few cups of wine, Zhang Zhen slowly began to tell a story--
    ...When I went to work, I had already learned as an apprentice for three years, so I was a craftsman when I started work. At that time, there were four masters in the factory, and they formed a sworn brotherhood. Anyone who started work had to give them gifts. Me, I was young, full of energy, relying on my skills, who would care about that?
    One day, I was brewing a pot of tea, pouring it myself, and squatting on the ground drinking it. That master came over with a hammer in his waist, swaying, and kicked the pot of tea all over the place. I was still squatting without saying a word. I thought, is it so humiliating? No, I can't save face. Beat him, there will be trouble. Then I thought, if there's a loss of wealth, there will be trouble, at most, it will just touch the head! Whew. I stood up, went up and grabbed his collar, twisted his arm and beat him to the ground, and casually picked up the hammer from his waist, and with a few blows, knocked out a few small peaks on him, and then others persuaded him to stop...
    "This time, I regained face, but I also smashed the rice bowl... At that time, you weren't born yet, I just got married, my father scolded, my mother cried, and the whole family didn't have a place to settle down. What should I do? Go apologize to people, that's not the way. Forced to the end, I was demoted and changed to a helper. From then on, I never had a chance to get ahead."
    "Who was that master?" Zhang Zhu asked with wide eyes. Who? It's that "sky spirit cover" who just transferred!
    I've somersaulted in his hands several times. Suffer the anger and humiliation, droop your head and do it! Sometimes I get angry, drink a few ounces of wine and pretend to be confused. In that world, there's no reason to talk about, in order to support my family, I just muddled through for decades.
    "After liberation, I also hoped to turn over, but after a day or two, seeing that people were still in their positions, I slowly became indifferent. So I opposed you going to work for the union, afraid that you would offend people. Now, I finally understand, the Communist Party doesn't wrong people, doesn't bury people! Brother, we workers are the masters, the factory has become our own, the union is really working for the workers, in the future, if you have any opinions, just raise them, what you said is absolutely right, in this era, there is a place to say reason, no need to be afraid of wolves in front and tigers in the back..."
    Soon, Zhang Zhen joined the union, and his work became even more enthusiastic!

    June 1949, Changxindian Machine Factory.

专栏：

    兄弟俩
    逯斐
    一
    张珍是个铆工帮匠，在这厂子里，谁都认识他，个子比一般人挫些，干活、说话总是不紧不慢。年老些的工友，都知道他那劲儿，年轻的伙友，就嫌他太软绵，火性不够。他见了领班主任，三榔头打不出一个叮铛来。照理说，在旧社会里，这样一个老实结巴的人，该比那些“犯上”的工人生活顺当些吧；再说得确实一点，总该比他兄弟张珠好些吧？其实倒不一定。正如他兄弟常说的那样：“你牛马样干，落下个什么了？干了三十年的铆工，还不是帮匠一个？”张珍听了这话，除了叹口气，也就算了。——那年头，哪里论技术？更不讲干劲。
    说到张珍的技术，三十年的铆工，都能把活儿吃进肚里去了，真有几下。干起活来，虽说瘦格挤挤，胳膊跟铁链子似的；抡起三斤半大锤，咛呀咛的，可不是没劲。只有一个毛病，就是在那些眉眼上架起水磨镜的人跟前，塌成了一摊，哼呀哈的，说不上几个不字。不会吹不会叠，更不会背着茶叶包包送礼，因此直到如今，还只挣二十一块底薪。
    他兄弟张珠，年岁挫他一半，睁的钱倒是三十四块二。按技术说，就该挣这些；按他那股子牛劲，不落下个“刷”就是好的。可他还是干得好好的，那又为什么呢？那是凭的两个拳头，在那社会里敲打出来的。
    哥儿俩，除了活儿干得一样棒儿漂亮，脾性上可大不相同。哥，不言不道的；兄弟却是活蹦乱跳，说干，卷起袖子乒呀乓的就干。当头的过来吩咐活儿，总是拧了个脖子，象该了他二斗米似的；头儿走了，活儿可错不了。可是他要一垛脚，就离地三尺，在那旧社会里，犯上了脾气，没一样被他看顺眼的。在厂里，看工具放的不是地方，就骂，看见那些大官们吃喝乐，也要骂。
    有一次，国民党路局的什么官儿，到这厂来查看“饿工”。来的那阵，谱儿摆的十足，进了厂，每个工人都坐着，谁也没给他点头呵腰。他走到张珠跟前，张珠仍是两腿十字叠着，眼睛里却把他瞅进去了？那王八蛋气得脸儿都发青。到末了，还不是乖乖儿的给开支。
    所以张珠常对他哥说：“那些王八兔崽子，文明棍拿着，半节节里带着‘腰硬’（手枪），臭劲儿挺足；只有给他点颜色看，他才知道咱工人不是好惹的！”张珍听说，每次总是这几句话：“你还没尝过那味儿！降级、‘刷’，一家几口要混饭吃，咱们攒在他们手心里，有嘛办法？”
    张珠没长心眼，也没那份耐心去追根究底，反正不同意他哥。而张珍呢？总觉得兄弟是个毛孩子——本来嘛，兄弟跟自己的儿子一般大小，在他看来，长多大岁数也还是个孩子。——除了怕兄弟在厂里出事，别的活儿都没给较量过。
    还是当年张珍的父亲被鬼子刷下来的时候，他们在河边开了一亩三分河滩地。不几年父亲死去，担子就落在张珍肩上，撩下了榔头就拿起锄头，成天价磨磨蹭蹭没闲下过。
    老娘见张珍就痛他，媳妇自然更痛自己丈夫，婆媳俩通了气，赚下几个钱，就给张珍打四两酒，煮上些菜，背着张珠的面给他吃。老娘怕老儿子说自己偏心，——本来嘛，十指尖尖，那一个也连心，只是老大生的单薄，家里活又靠他，更可怜见些；媳妇儿也是怕人说自己不贤慧，加上小叔子挣的比丈夫多，光惦着丈夫，也有点亏心。婆媳俩就尽这样瞒着办！
    可是一家子过日子，鼻子眼睛挤在一起，还有不透风的墙？有一回，叫张珠知道了，吵得个天翻地覆，六神不安。张珍急了，要揍兄弟，兄弟却也不让，拣起什么扔什么，把头顶上的电灯震得直幌荡；一家子哭的哭啼的啼，好不伤心！到了儿，兄弟俩见面，就跟门神一样，对面也不说话。
    二
    解放以后，兄弟俩还是各走各的道，张珠成天在厂里，除了上工，不是听课就是开会，不到吃饭点，不到黑半夜，就不落家。只是赶上休息没事，在家倒也肯挑挑担担的帮着干点活。
    老娘悄悄对儿妇说：“这野种，这阵子再不乱跺脚了，敢情这年头叫他变成人模样了？”嫂子也说：“兄弟倒是长大成人了。”老娘和嫂子虽这末说，可还惦着他不知在外面尽干些什么，怕出什么岔丢了饭碗子。老娘就常给张珍说：“父死从兄，还得你做长兄的管教管教才对，我可制不了他！”
    张珍呢？除了做工就在家，碰上开会，能遛就遛，有时遛不了就待着。有一回听课，他检着听了一星半点，说什么工人阶级是无产阶级……，什么是无产阶级，他也没再听下去，自己捉摸着，准是房无一间地无一垄的。他一心只想着自己，自己还有一亩三分地呢！原打算积几个钱盖间房，免得受房主的气，现在再别提了。他左右前后的伙伴们，最摆谱的是早先跑车的，卖头份力气；挣的最少是工务段，干了几十年还是“穿房檐”的多。自己有这亩多地，那还象无产阶级！他想：现在按小米子发钱，总比早先活动些，够吃够喝了，倒不如把那地送人，省得许多麻烦，也能做一个澈头澈尾的无产阶级。
    星期天，张珍真的跑到街公所去，说是家里活多人单，忙不过来，共产党不埋没人才，自己要好好干活。要是干这干那，这叫“样样精通，样样稀松”，还能尽都干美满了？他要求街公所收下他的地，给谁种都行。街公所没摸着底细，未即时回话，张珍却顾自走出来了。
    不知怎末的，张珍绕道儿又到了河边，瞅见自己那地，想到往年种的瓜瓜菜菜，可又有点不是味儿。回到家，一句话也没说，倒头就去睡了。
    过了几天，星期二，下了一场透雨，中午张珍回家，淋得水鸭子似的，直骂天。偏偏娘又等他兄弟不回来，要他给送饭去，他更不自在。但还是撑了一把雨伞，提了饭盒，胳臂下挟着鞋子，一滑一颠的走了。
    到厂门口的小桥边，泥浆咯吱咯吱的，他为闪过一辆大车，哧＠一下，摔到水沟里去了，滚了半身子泥。过路的人都乐得大声笑，张珍气得更没法说，爬起来就到张珠的厂里去。谁知到那儿，扑了一个空；上办公室，也没有。气儿越涨越大，恨不得一下子把饭盒扔了，把兄弟拉过去，痛痛快快揍一顿。
    他转游过去，又回到厂子，才有人告诉他，张珠被调到工会去了，张珍听说，火上加油，换别人早不送去了。到了工会，见他兄弟迎出来，把饭盒一扔，绷着个脸回头就要走！张珠赶忙叫住了哥，道谢又解释——说明工会把自己调来帮忙，今天赶上开会，又下雨，怕误了公事，麻烦了哥。张珍听说，火星直爆：“你知道耽误这，耽误那，我滚成咸鸭蛋就活该！”说着，自以为理直气壮的走了。张珠在背后响亮的说：“这不比早先，我也是为大家伙办事呀！”
    张珍这天下班到家，挺不自在，一边担水，一边挂着脸，就象要寻事似的。晚上，老娘在灯下嘀咕着张珠成天不落家，张珍乘势说：“毛小子一个，到什么工会去办事，还不是削了脑袋往前钻，想抄近道！不学机器学这些，将来——哼！别落下个武大郎攀杠子——刷下来了才够味呢！”
    老娘听说更是叼叼，母子俩你一言我一语的，说过去国民党的工会贪污的事，吃官司的事，工会的人不替工人办事，又得罪人。又说现在这工会，虽说不一样，那些“三朝元老”，不还压在头上？办好了，工人喜欢，又犯了上；办不好，得罪弟兄们事呀！比方说，一个活儿叫他做了，没做的省劲，多做的还不要骂办事的人？嘴上不说，心里不痛快你，那能落好了呀……
    夜深，张珠从工会回来，哥和娘又把他说了一顿，张珠只回道：“别隔了筛子看人！如今工人干那样活不干在头前。我这是为大家伙办事，也就是解放作主人！”张珍说：“解放作主人？谁是主人？那些‘三朝元老’，还不是住的阔，吃的谱，我看好人赖人还是分不清。”张珠说：“死顽固脑筋，事情一天就能办好了？”张珍说：“一天办好？解放快三个月了，多少人调了，就是那王八盖子调不走，瞧他还不是当主任！”
    张珠回房，翻来复去睡不着，他知道哥说的是谁，想着第二天一定要提醒工会。
    过了几天，各工会小组讨论人事问题，小组讨论完又开大会讨论。大会在礼堂进行，张珍一声不响的听别人发言，表决时，他用眼睛瞟瞟左右前后，胳膊也是伸一半挫一半。最后，讨论到他厂子里的主任了，张珠跳上台去说：“……我说说，这是‘门子货’，啥技术也没！外号天灵盖，尽压住咱工人搂钱；前年当旧工会代表时，发福利煤不够数，逼着工人跌价卖给他，也逼我哥卖给他了。象这样的人，非把他刷了！”说完，大伙辈儿一鼓掌。又有人上台发言，反对把他刷掉，说宽大些，教育教育他，降级就成。……争过来，争过去，张珠一次又一次的坚持自己的意见。
    张珍看着站在跟前的主任的外甥，急得满头是汗。兄弟说主任的错处是说得满对，自己吃他的苦可也不少，可是主任的外甥在场，哪还不透风去？要是降不服他，那还能放过了张家人！就是真能杀住了势气，也不能不防个暗算呀！
    会散了，半道上张珍和张珠照面，三言两语又吵了起来。张珍说：“你这叫人当锣儿打，闹个里外不是人，你个人得罪了别人，还把我夹在里头；你攒在人家手心里多少年了，没翻了身……”张珠说：“就为了你没翻身呀！现在工人当了主人，有事大家伙讨论。一切有共产党领导，为大伙办事，就不能前怕狼后怕虎！”说完一摔胳膊朝前去了。
    从此，兄弟俩又是门神一对，见面不说话了。
    三
    一个月以后，张珍那厂的主任调去集训了，张珍心里踏实许多，想着兄弟说的做的也有几分对。又过了半个月，凡是以前拿二十一块底薪的都增加了，张珍也没有例外。同时还进行了技术考试，张珍似信不信的也去考了，公报下来，他考上了工匠。乐的他到处说：“天睁眼，共产党真不埋没人才！”
    那天正赶上张珍歇班，天很闷热，街公所的同志，跑的满头大汗来告诉他，人民革命大学的同学，帮助村里春耕，替张珍那地也耕了，叫赶忙撒种，不要误了雨后。说完连白水都没喝一口就走。张珍边送边道谢：“真是太麻烦了！”那同志笑嘻嘻的说：“没什么！做这点事，说不上麻烦。”
    张珍听了，着实感动。过去，在他看来，什么干部、学生是不会真为大伙办事的。今天，他亲眼看到了，而且，给自己耕了地，饭也不吃，水也不喝。他想着，社会真是变了。
    厂里黑板报上写了个启事：新民主主义青年团发起修马路，征求职工们参加。张珍第一个报了名，还积极的动员别人：“来一个吧，这是为大家，也为自己！”他把下雨那天摔交的事说了一遍又一遍。很多铆工都参加了，每天下班后修一点钟，没三天工夫就全修好了。
    星期天，张珠上完课回家，赶上张珍正买了点酒菜，便一把拉住，兄弟俩象过年那样对坐着喝起来。娘对媳妇说：“兄弟俩感情对了劲儿了！”一家子因为这，也都高高兴兴，热闹得多。张珍几杯酒落肚，慢慢的讲起故事来——
    ……我上班那会，已经学过了三年徒，所以上班就是工匠。那时厂里有四个师儿，一气儿拜了把子，凡是新上班的，一定要给他们送礼。我嘛，年轻，血气方刚，凭的是技术，谁理那岔儿？
    一天，我正沏了一壶茶，自个斟上，蹲在地上喝。那大师腰里插个榔头，三摇一摆的过来，啪一下，把一壶茶踢的满场子飞。我仍蹲着没言语，我想，就这末丢人么？不成，脸搁不下。揍他，要出乱了。随后一想，是财不散，出了乱子，最多不过头点地！唬哧一下。我站起来，走上去一把领子，拧住胳膊就把他揍倒在地下，随手从他腰里拣起榔头，几下子敲出了他几个小山峰，旁人才劝住了。……
    “这回，面子算争回来了，可是饭碗也砸了。………那时候你还没出世，我才娶了，爹骂，娘哭，一家子不落实。怎么办呢？给人赔不是去，那不是个味儿。逼得走头无路，降级改成了帮匠。从这就再不曾有出头之日。”
    “那个师儿是谁呀？”张珠瞪大了眼睛问。谁？就是那才调走的“天灵盖”！
    我在他手心里栽筋斗好几回了。受气受屈搭拉了脑袋干吧！有时心里冒火，喝他几两装个糊涂。那世道，没有理好说，为了养家活口，就这末混了几十年。
    “解放后，我也指望过翻身，一天两天，看看人家还是当位，慢慢也淡了。所以反对你去干工会，怕你得罪人。现在，我才雪亮了，共产党不冤屈人，不埋没人！兄弟，咱工人当了主人，工厂成了自己的，工会也真给工人办事，以后有意见就提，你说的一点也不错，这年头理儿有说处，不用前怕狼后怕虎的………”
    不久，张珍参加了工会，自己的工作搞的更起劲了！
    一九四九，六月初，长辛店机厂。
