　　Ping City Women's Committee Invites Experts
  　To Discuss Women's Production Opportunities
    [Report from this newspaper] The CCP Beiping Municipal Women's Committee invited experts in handicrafts, specialty handicrafts, and cooperative enterprises from the city, as well as individuals enthusiastic about women's production, to a symposium at the European and American Alumni Association on the 15th (the day before yesterday). Attendees included: Pu Jiexiu, Li Shushan, Zhang Zhongshi, Liu Qingyang, Zheng Dizhi, Sun Qingtang, Chen Wenrun, Niu Xiyuan, Bai Bijun, and Zhang Qinqiu from the All-China Women's Federation, Wang Chun from the Cooperative Headquarters, and more than 40 others. The symposium was presided over by Zhang Xiuyan and Zhang Xiaomei, the secretary and deputy secretary of the Women's Committee. Comrade Zhang Xiuyan first briefly reported on the work of the Women's Committee over the past four months, raised current difficulties and problems, and asked everyone for criticism and guidance. Then, everyone spoke, raising many experiences and opinions on the restoration of drawnwork and embroidery handicrafts, and on what kind of production women can be organized to engage in at present. Everyone unanimously agreed that the current difficulties are unavoidable during the transition period, but efforts must be made to overcome them. As long as there is planned and organized leadership, Beiping's handicrafts and cooperative enterprises have a very promising future. Specialty handicrafts can also be partially restored. Zhang Zhongshi, Bai Bijun, Li Shushan, Huang Peizhi and others spoke in detail about how prosperous the drawnwork and embroidery industry used to be and why it has gradually declined in recent years. Pu Jiexiu talked about three tasks that should be done in organizing women's production: (1) First, conduct investigation and research on how many women in Beiping can engage in production and what kind of production they can engage in; (2) Organize scattered producers, first restore the original handicrafts; (3) Strengthen publicity and education work, and establish the view that labor is honorable. Regarding the question of how to organize women to engage in production and what kind of production to engage in in the future, Zhang Ziyu proposed running an egg-beating factory; Niu Xiyuan, Han Zhiwen, and others proposed calling on every household to raise chickens and run larger-scale chicken farms; Sun Qingtang talked about his many years of beekeeping experience. This type of production has low costs and favorable environment. Sheep casings were also a very popular export specialty. Li Shufen, the principal of Jianzhi Women's Vocational School, talked about her moving experience of starting the school with hardship. Currently, she is leading her students in sewing production. In addition, Liu Qingyang, Zheng Dizhi, Zhang Zunzhao, and others all talked about their experience in running women's production cooperatives. Comrade Wang Chun, director of the Beiping Supply and Marketing Cooperative Headquarters, pointed out that the main market for handicrafts is in the vast rural areas. The biggest problem at present is to open up the relationship between urban and rural areas and support farmers' production. As for organizing women's production, he suggested first concentrating on one or two kinds of production with good sales, setting up a handicraft product store, and calling on educated women to go to the countryside to serve the farmers.

　　平市妇委邀集专家
  　研讨妇女生产门路
    【本报讯】中共北平市妇委会于前（十五）日假欧美同学会邀请本市手工业、特种手工艺、合作事业专家及热心妇女生产事业的人士举行座谈会，到会有：浦洁修、李淑善、张仲实、刘清扬、郑迪之、孙庆堂、陈文润、牛西园、白璧君及全国妇联张琴秋、合作总社王纯等四十余人，由妇委正副书记张秀岩、张晓梅二同志主持。首由张秀岩同志简单报告妇委会四个多月来的工作，提出目前的困难和问题，请大家批评和指教。接着大家发言，对挑补花手工艺的恢复，对目前可组织妇女搞那些生产，都提出了许多经验和意见。大家一致认为目前的困难是过渡时期不可避免的，但必须努力克服，只要有计划有组织者去领导，北平手工业及合作事业是很有前途的。特种手工艺也可以部分的恢复起来，张仲实、白璧君、李淑善、黄佩芝等对挑补花业过去如何兴盛和近年来为什么逐渐凋蔽都说得很具体。浦洁修谈组织妇女生产应做好三件工作：（一）首先对北平有多少妇女可搞生产及可搞那些生产进行调查研究；（二）把零散的生产者组织起来，先恢复原有的手工业；（三）加强宣教工作，建立劳动为荣的观点。关于今后如何组织妇女搞生产，搞什么生产的问题，张子余提出搞打蛋厂；牛西园、韩致文等提出号召家家养鸡及办规模较大的鸡场；孙庆堂谈了他多年的养蜂经验。这种生产成本低而环境有利。羊肠也是曾经很受欢迎的出口特产。坚志女职校长李淑芬谈了她动人的艰苦创校的经历，目前她正在领导她的学生搞缝纫生产。此外刘清扬、郑迪之、张尊昭等都谈了她们办妇女生产合作社的经验。北平供销合作总社主任王纯同志指出手工业品的主要市场在广大农村，目前最大问题是要打通城乡关系，扶植农民生产。至于组织妇女生产，他建议先集中搞一两种有销路的生产，搞一个手工业产品门市部，并号召知识妇女下乡，为农民服务。
