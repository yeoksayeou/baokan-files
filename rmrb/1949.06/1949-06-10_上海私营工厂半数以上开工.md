Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 9th. Since the liberation of Shanghai, 363 private factories, including steel, leather, flour, rice milling, and lead products factories, have resumed operations, accounting for more than half of the total number of factories in these industries. Many factories in these industries were suppressed by the Kuomintang bureaucrat-capitalists and affected by the collapse of the bogus currency before liberation, falling into a state of stagnation. Now, the People's Government is working hard to open up transportation and appropriately purchase finished products to help the factories solve difficulties such as raw materials, sales channels, and funds. The factories that have not yet started work are striving to resume production before the end of this month.

　　上海私营工厂半数以上开工
    【新华社上海九日电】上海市解放后，私营工厂已有钢铁、制革、面粉、碾米、铅器等三百六十三家开工，占各该业工厂总数的一半以上。这些行业的许多工厂在解放前受国民党官僚资本的压制，和伪币崩溃的影响，陷于停顿状态。现人民政府正努力开辟交通和酌情收购成品，以帮助各厂解决原料、销路和资金等困难。现未开工各厂正力求于本月底以前复工。
