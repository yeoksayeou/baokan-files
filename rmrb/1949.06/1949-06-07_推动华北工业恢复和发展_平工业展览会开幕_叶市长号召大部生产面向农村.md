　　Promoting the Recovery and Development of North China's Industry
  　The Beiping Industrial Exhibition Opens
    Mayor Ye calls for most production to be geared towards rural areas.
    [Beiping News] The Beiping Industrial Exhibition opened at 9:30 AM on the 6th in the Laijin Yuxuan Hall of Zhongshan Park. Attendees included: representatives from participating public and private enterprises, representatives from party, government, and civilian organizations in Beiping, worker representatives from various districts, visiting delegations from central Hebei, Chahar, and Hebei-Luyu, democratic figures and economic experts from Hong Kong and Shanghai, and professors from various universities in Beiping, totaling approximately 700 people. Bao Guobao, Deputy Director of the Exhibition Preparatory Committee, pointed out at the opening ceremony that the content of this exhibition strives to genuinely represent the products of Beiping's industry. Furthermore, the primary criteria for evaluation are whether the products suit the needs of the vast rural and urban populations and whether they can be transported and sold abroad. Mayor Ye Jianying stated in his address that today, the people of the liberated areas face no more political difficulties and obstacles in developing production. The people of our liberated areas, especially industrialists and businesspeople, can confidently enter into a long period of peaceful economic construction. Mayor Ye pointed out that in production and construction, the policy of "considering both public and private interests, benefiting both labor and capital, promoting exchange between urban and rural areas, and mutual benefit both internally and externally" should be implemented comprehensively. Today, both labor and capital should enhance their enthusiasm for production, and both public and private enterprises must develop in tandem. The majority of production must be geared towards rural areas. We should strive to use industrial production to supply agricultural means of production. Only when agriculture is developed can industrial development have a practical foundation. Mayor Ye said that the People's Government will listen to opinions from all sides and seek to improve all man-made difficulties that hinder production development. Yao Yilin, Minister of Industry and Commerce of the North China People's Government, pointed out in his speech that there are many tasks that require the government and industrialists and businesspeople to work together to resolve. For example, regarding the export of handicrafts, the government is studying tax reductions to reduce export costs. Product types should be adapted to match sales channels, and planned organization of procurement, distribution of raw materials, and promotion of finished products should be conducted. Plans should also be made to vigorously promote industrial products and purchase agricultural products after the wheat harvest and autumn harvest, to further facilitate the exchange of materials between urban and rural areas. Comrade Xiao Ming of the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions mentioned in his speech that, in order to implement the policy of benefiting both labor and capital, the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions has begun to systematically resolve labor-capital issues in various industries.
    [Reported by this newspaper] The Beiping Industrial Exhibition opened yesterday (the 6th), and representative visitors from various regions have arrived successively. As of yesterday evening (the 6th), more than sixty representatives from six regions, including central Hebei, eastern Hebei, Hebei-Luyu, Chahar, Jinzhou, and Shijiazhuang, had arrived. (Yu)
