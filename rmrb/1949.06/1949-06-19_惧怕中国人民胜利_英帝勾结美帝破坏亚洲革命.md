　　Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 18th: News recently arrived in Shanghai from India states that British reactionaries are colluding with US imperialism, actively employing various conspiracies to sabotage the rising national democratic movements in Asian countries. The main elements of these tactics include praising Asian conservatism, cultivating forces inclined towards British and US imperialism, and provoking divisions in the revolutionary unity of the Asian people. According to reliable sources in India, in March, the Deputy Leader of the British Conservative Party, Eden, under the supervision of Lacy, the US State Department's head of Asian affairs, convened a secret meeting in New Delhi, India, specifically to discuss strengthening British anti-people and anti-national propaganda work in Asia. At this meeting, attended by key British officials from Southeast Asian countries, Eden read out an implementation plan for propaganda work, approved by the Labour government, and recommended it to the governments of British dominions, local governors, and colonial authorities in Southeast Asian countries. According to this plan, the British government has established a unified guidance center in Delhi for propaganda work in countries within the British sphere of influence. The key points of the plan are as follows: (1) Using the assistance of propaganda work to create divisions between the left and right wings within the national fronts of various colonies. (2) Exploiting and expanding the contradictions between different ethnic groups, classes, and organizations within the colonial people to weaken their common revolutionary struggle against imperialism and its running dogs. (3) Promoting Gandhi's and other compromisers' non-resistance doctrine, and in school education, promoting the stability and superiority of the traditional way of life in Southeast Asian feudal and semi-feudal societies. (4) Assisting Western missionaries in expanding their sectarian propaganda activities and utilizing various organizations that advocate consolidating the conservative political systems of Southeast Asian countries. (5) Gradually restricting the left-wing forces in the publishing industry. (6) Providing financial assistance to pro-British newspapers, magazines, and other books for publication and distribution. (7) Widely promoting the Anglo-Saxon way of life. The news states that when Eden presented this plan at the meeting, he delivered a lengthy speech expressing extreme fear of the victory of the Chinese People's Liberation War, even though the People's Liberation Army had not yet crossed the Yangtze River three months prior. Eden declared that the Asian national liberation movement was a "threat to Anglo-American interests." After acknowledging that the imperialist method of suppressing the colonial people's liberation movement with violence had failed, he proposed that under the current circumstances, "deeply considered propaganda is extremely necessary to counter all anti-European ideas that have already occurred," and he referred to using propaganda work to "paralyze" the revolutionary forces at the current stage as "one of the most effective methods."

　　惧怕中国人民胜利
  　英帝勾结美帝破坏亚洲革命
    【新华社上海十八日电】新近由印度到达上海的消息称；英国反动派正和美帝国主义勾结在一起积极采取各种阴谋手段来破坏亚洲各国高涨中的民族民主运动，这些手段中的主要项目就是歌颂亚洲的保守主义，培植倾向英美帝国主义的势力和挑拨亚洲人民的革命团结。据印度可靠方面消息，在三月间，英国保守党副首领艾登在美国国务院亚洲事务主管人莱西监督下，曾在印度新德里召开秘密会议，专门讨论加强英国在亚洲进行反人民反民族的宣传工作问题。艾登在这一有英国驻东南亚各国首要官员参加的会议上，宣读了一个经过工党政府批准了的宣传工作实施计划，推荐给英国各自治领政府，各地总督和东南亚各国的殖民地当局。按照该项计划，英政府已在德里组织对英国势力范围内各国的宣传工作的统一指导中心。据悉计划的要点如下：（一）利用宣传工作的帮助，来制造各殖民地民族阵线内左右翼之间的分歧。（二）利用和扩大殖民地人民内部不同民族、不同阶级、不同组织间的矛盾，来松懈他们共同反抗帝国主义及其走狗的革命斗争。（三）宣传甘地及其他妥协分子的不抵抗主义，在学校教育中宣传东南亚封建、半封建社会的传统生活方式的安定性和优越性。（四）帮助西欧传教师扩大教派宣传的活动，利用各种主张巩固东南亚各国保守政体的组织。（五）逐渐限制出版界的左翼势力。（六）对亲英的报纸杂志和其他书籍等的出版发行，给以经济上的帮助。（七）广泛宣传盎格罗撒克逊的生活方式。消息称：艾登在会上提出这一计划时曾发表长篇演说，对中国人民解放战争的胜利表示极大的恐惧，虽然三个月以前人民解放军还未渡过长江。艾登宣称亚洲民族解放运动是对“英美利益的威胁”。他在承认帝国主义以暴力镇压殖民地人民解放运动的方法已告破产以后，提出在目前情况下“极度要求以深思熟虑的宣传来对抗一切已经发生的反欧洲思想”，而且把利用宣传工作来“麻痹”目前阶段的革命力量，称之为“最有效的方法之一”。
