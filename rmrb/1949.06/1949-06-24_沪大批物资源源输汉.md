Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, June 23rd. The exchange of goods between Shanghai and Hankou is gradually becoming more active, with large quantities of goods being shipped from Shanghai to Wuhan via the Yangtze River to meet market needs. When the White bandit Chongxi retreated, he looted a large quantity of materials from Wuhan, resulting in a shortage of materials in Wuhan after liberation. After consultation between the Shanghai and Hankou trade offices, Shanghai decided to ship 50,000 tons of goods to Hankou, while Wuhan would supply Shanghai with tung oil, tea, and other products. Of the 50,000 tons, 4,000 tons have already been shipped to Hankou. Now, another batch of goods, including cotton yarn, cloth, hardware, newspapers, and other daily necessities, totaling more than 400 tons, will be transported to Hankou by the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Jiangling ship. The first batch of tung oil and tea shipped from Hankou to Shanghai arrived a few days ago.

    沪大批物资源源输汉
    【新华社上海二十三日电】沪汉间物资交流已渐趋活跃，大批货物正源源由上海经长江运往武汉，供应市场需要。白匪崇禧撤退时曾将武汉物资大批劫走，致使解放后武汉物资短缺。经沪汉两地贸易处协商后，上海决以五万吨货物输汉，武汉则以桐油、茶叶等供应沪市。五万吨中运汉者已有四千吨，现又有一批货物包括棉纱、布匹、五金、报纸及其他日用品等共四百余吨，即由招商局江陵号专轮运汉。由汉输沪之首批桐油、茶叶则已于日前到达。
