Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, June 26th: The Shanghai English-owned "North-China Daily News," which fabricated the so-called rumor about mine-laying in the Yangtze River, has submitted a report to the Shanghai Military Control Commission (after the Shanghai Military Control Commission of the People's Liberation Army sternly criticized it (this newspaper mistakenly printed "serious support" in yesterday's broadcast) and Shanghai people protested vehemently) admitting its mistake and guaranteeing that it will not repeat it. Considering that the newspaper has already admitted its mistake, the Military Control Commission decided to leniently impose a severe warning on the newspaper, and ordered the newspaper to publish the Military Control Commission's order of punishment and the newspaper's letter of repentance in a prominent position in the newspaper. After the newspaper's act of fabricating rumors was exposed, it initially attempted to deny it, attributing it to a "misunderstanding." After the Foreign Affairs Office of the Shanghai Military Control Commission sternly criticized it, and the people of Shanghai also protested against the newspaper, it finally submitted a report to the Military Control Commission on the 23rd admitting its mistake. Shanghai's "Liberation Daily" published a short commentary on this incident entitled "The Chinese People Cannot Be Humiliated," stating: The liberated Chinese people can no longer tolerate some foreigners in China relying on imperialist privileges, doing whatever they want, arbitrarily harming the interests of the Chinese people, and not being subject to legal sanctions, as they did in the past. The liberated Chinese people already possess incomparably strong power. If anyone attempts to challenge this, they will surely suffer a crushing defeat. The "North-China Daily News" rumor incident is merely a minor example.

The full text of the Military Control Commission's order punishing the "North-China Daily News" and the newspaper's letter of apology are as follows: Military Control Commission of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, Shanghai, Wai Xin Zi No. 1 Order:

　　It has been found that the English-owned "North-China Daily News" began publishing news on the 10th of this month about the Kuomintang reactionary government laying mines at the mouth of the Wusong River. Since then, it has continued to spread this alarming and fabricated information. The people of the city are extremely angry and resentful of the newspaper's absurd actions, and have successively appealed to this Commission to impose severe sanctions. This Commission believes that the masses' demands are completely justified. The newspaper's error is very serious. However, considering that the newspaper's person in charge, Griffin, has already submitted a written admission of error to this Commission yesterday, guaranteeing that it will not repeat it in the future, a lenient punishment is imposed, giving the newspaper a severe warning; and the newspaper is instructed to publish its letter of repentance and this Commission's order in a prominent position on the first page of the newspaper. This order is hereby issued.

　　上海英商字林西报捏造布雷谣言
  　沪军管会予以严重警告
    该报保证今后不发生同样错误
    【新华社上海二十六日电】捏造所谓长江布雷谣言的上海英商字林西报，在人民解放军上海军管会严正指斥（本报昨载广播稿误为“严重支持”（和上海各界人民的激愤抗议下，呈文上海军管会承认错误，并保证不再重犯。军管会以该报既已承认错误，特予从宽发落，予该报以严重警告处分，并令将军管会处分该报命令和该报悔过之呈文于该报显著地位刊出。该报捏造谣言的行为被揭发后，最初曾图抵赖，推诿出于“误会”，经上海军管会外侨事务处严正指斥，上海人民对该报也纷纷提出抗议，始于二十三日呈文军管会承认错误。上海解放日报对此次事件以“中国人民不可悔”为题发表短评称：解放了的中国人民，再也不能容许某些在华外国人象过去一样依仗帝国主义的特权，为所欲为，随意损害中国人民的利益，而不受到法律的制裁。解放了的中国人民已具有无比坚强的力量，如果有人妄想碰一碰，那他就一定要碰得头破血流。字林西报造谣的事件，不过是一个微小的例子。
    军管会处罚字林西报命令及字林西报道歉书全文如下：中国人民解放军上海军事管制委员会外新字　第一号命令：
    查英商字林西报于本月十日开始刊载国民党反动政府在吴淞口敷设水雷之新闻，此后并继续传播，危言耸听，纯出捏造。全市人民对该报此种悖谬举动，极为痛愤，纷纷吁请本会严加制裁。本会认为群众此种要求完全正当，该报错误甚大，惟念该报负责人葛立芬昨日已向本会书面承认错误，保证今后不再重犯，特从宽处分，予该报严重警告一次；并着该报将其悔过之呈文及本会命令，同时在该报第一版显著地位刊出，此令。
