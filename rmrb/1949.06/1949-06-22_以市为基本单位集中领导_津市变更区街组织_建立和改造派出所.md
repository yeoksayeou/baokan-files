Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, June 21st: The Tianjin Municipal People's Government recently convened an enlarged meeting of district and street cadres, announcing changes to district and street organizations. A total of 560 people from various bureaus under the municipal government and from districts and streets attended the meeting. At the meeting, the Secretary-General of the Municipal Government pointed out: After the liberation of Tianjin, we thoroughly destroyed the Kuomintang's Baojia system of ruling and oppressing the people and established a three-level government of city, district, and street. In the past five months, thanks to the hard-working and simple style of the district and street cadres, and their spirit of serving the people wholeheartedly, much work has been done. However, the urban economy and regions are concentrated. All economic, cultural, and political construction must be carried out centrally with the city as the basic unit. The establishment of two-level governments at the district and street levels fragments the city's centralized leadership. In the work of districts and streets, there is a phenomenon of anarchy and lack of discipline in dealing with some relevant policy issues. As for organizational and propaganda work among citizens, it should be organized at the city level by mass organizations composed of various professions, and should not be organized by district and street units. Moreover, the district and street governments are very overlapping, which often excessively interferes with the lives of citizens, making them feel that government affairs are too cumbersome. Therefore, the municipal government has decided to change the district and street organizations, abolish the district governments, and change them to district public offices, which will serve as the municipal government's dispatched agencies. Their task is only to carry out the matters assigned by the municipal government and understand the situation in each district. Each district public office will have one district head, one secretary, five assistants and staff members. The cadres of the household registration section and mediation section of the original district government will be transferred to work in the public security sub-bureaus or police stations, the cadres of the culture and education section will be transferred to the education bureau for assignment, and the cadres of the economic section will be transferred to the industry and commerce bureau and the cooperative. In the future, the industry and commerce bureau and the cooperative will still set up branch bureaus and branches in various districts, and the health bureau's health offices in various districts will be responsible for guiding the health work in each district. The street governments have also been decided to be abolished, and their original cadres will be assigned to various public security police stations to strengthen and expand the public security bureau organization. The public security bureau will set up public security sub-bureaus in various districts, with the sub-bureaus being the main organizations in each district. The sub-bureaus will have several police stations, which will directly approach the citizens, protect the interests of the citizens, and manage social security and public order. A police station will be set up in each of the larger rural areas in the suburban areas, and village public offices will be organized separately. The staff of the village public offices will adhere to the principle of not being separated from production.

Subsequently, Xu Jianguo, Director of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, explained the issue of transforming and establishing new police stations. He said: Police stations are the grassroots organizations of the Municipal Public Security Bureau that specifically implement the protection of the people, and they are organizations that directly contact the masses. At present, there are a total of 272 police stations in the city. Each station has one director, and if necessary, one deputy director. Underneath are clerks and household registration police. Each police station must resolutely and unreservedly carry out the orders and tasks of the superiors, and there must be no transgressions. The specific scope of work is: (1) household registration management, (2) social investigation, (3) prevention of spy activities, (4) prevention of bandit activities, (5) protection of public buildings and banning of illegal buildings, (6) mediation of civil disputes, (7) educating the masses to consciously abide by government decrees, (8) supervising public sanitation, (9) enforcing the prohibition of opium and gambling, and (10) banning residents' illegal acts. Then he talked about the discipline that the police of the police stations should observe. He said: The discipline that the police should observe is: (1) strictly abide by government decrees, (2) protect the interests of the people, (3) abide by mass discipline, (4) execute the orders of superiors, (5) report to superiors in a timely manner, (6) do not report falsely without reason, (7) do not be corrupt and accept bribes, and (8) do not abuse public office for personal gain. He also said: The police are the direct protectors of the people, protecting the consolidation of revolutionary organizations and the lives and property of the people, so that the people can live and work in peace and contentment. In a new democratic society, it is wrong to look at the current police with old eyes. Finally, he called on everyone to improve their political understanding and be new democratic, responsible to the people, eliminate harm for the people, and be the political police of the people.

    以市为基本单位集中领导
    津市变更区街组织  建立和改造派出所
    【新华社天津二十一日电】天津市人民政府于日前召开区街干部扩大会议，宣布变更区街组织。到市府所属各局及区、街干部五百六十余人。会上市政府秘书长指出：解放天津后，我们彻底摧毁了国民党统治压迫人民的保甲制度，建立市、区、街三级政权。五个月来，由于区街干部的艰苦朴素的作风，及全心全意为人民服务的精神，作了不少工作。但是，城市经济和区域都是集中的。一切经济、文化、政治的建设都必需以市为基本单位来集中进行。设立区街两级政权，则使市的集中领导割裂。在区、街工作中，对有些有关政策问题的处理，存在着无政府无纪律的现象。至于市民中组织与宣传工作，应以市为单位，按职业组成的各群众团体，也不应以区街为单位来组织。而且区街政权很重叠，往往会过多干扰市民生活，使市民感到政务太繁。所以市政府决定改变区街组织，取消区政府，改为区公所，作为市府的派出机关，其任务只是执行市政府交办的事项及了解各该区情况。各区公所设区长一人，秘书一人，助理员及干事共五人。原有区政府的户政股、调解股干部均调公安分局或派出所工作，文教股干部调教育局分配工作，经济股干部分别调到工商局与合作社工作。今后工商局及合作社仍将在各区设立分局与分社，卫生局在各区之卫生事务所负责指导各该区卫生工作。街政府亦决定取消，其原有干部分配到各公安派出所工作，以加强与扩大公安局组织。公安局在各区设公安分局，分局为各区的主要组织，分局下设若干派出所，派出所直接接近市民，保护市民利益，管理社会治安与公共秩序。在各市郊区较大的农村中各设一派出所，并另组织村公所，村公所办事人员以不脱离生产为原则。
    继由市公安局长许建国说明改造与建立新的派出所问题。他说：派出所是市府公安局具体执行保卫人民的基层组织，是直接联系群众的组织。现全市共设派出所二百七十二个，每所设所长一人，必要时设副所长一人，下设文书及户籍警察。每个派出所都要坚决地不折不扣地执行上级的命令和任务，不能有任何越轨行为。其具体工作范围为：（一）户籍管理，（二）社会调查，（三）防止特务奸细活动，（四）防止盗匪活动，（五）保护公共建筑物及取缔违章建筑物，（六）调解市民纠纷，（七）教育群众，自觉遵守政府法令，（八）督导公共清洁卫生，（九）执行禁烟禁赌，（十）取缔居民违法行为。接着他谈及派出所的警察应遵守纪律。他说：警察应遵守的纪律是：（１）严守政府法令，（２）保护人民利益，（３）遵守群众纪律，（４）执行上级命令，（５）有事及时向上级报告，（６）无故不得乱报，（７）不得贪赃受贿，（８）不得假公济私。他又说：警察是人民的直接保护者，保卫革命组织的巩固，保卫人民的生命财产，使人民安居乐业。在新民主主义社会里，以旧眼光看现在的警察是不对的。最后他号召大家要提高自己的政治认识，做一个新民主主义的、对人民负责的、为人民除害的、人民的政治警察。
