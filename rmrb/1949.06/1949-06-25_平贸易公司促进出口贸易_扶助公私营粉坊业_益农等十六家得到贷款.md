    Beijing Trading Company Promotes Export Trade
    Supports Public and Private Flour Mills
    Yinnong and 15 Other Businesses Receive Loans
    [Our Newspaper's Report] The Beijing Trading Company has begun to support the flour milling industry in the city, with the first batch of loans going to 16 businesses including Yinnong. In order to promote export trade and supply the needs of the textile industry, the company has successively supported 16 flour mills by exchanging raw materials for products. Among them, Yinnong (publicly owned), Lisheng, Nonggong, Fushengde, Simin, and Tongfeng (all privately owned) are engaged in the production of Longkou vermicelli. Fushenghao, Sanshunxing, Dequanyong Tian Taihao, and Gonglong are engaged in the production of starch. Longkou vermicelli originally comes from Longkou, Shandong, and is known for its fine, white, and high-quality texture. It is one of Shandong's special products. Each year, a portion is sold to South China, and the majority is exported to areas with large overseas Chinese populations in Southeast Asia. Later, due to the Japanese invasion, transportation became inconvenient, and manufacturers in that area began using mung beans from Xuanhua and other places along the Ping-Sui Railway, and used water from Yuquan Mountain for manufacturing. During its peak period, there were no fewer than a hundred such businesses. After the liberation of Beiping, although half of them still existed, their business was extremely depressed. This time, with the initial support of the Trading Company in exchanging raw materials for products, coupled with the fact that the export of vermicelli has become more active, not only have the six businesses including Yinnong had the opportunity to resume production (such as Fushengde, which has restored its original daily output to 250 jin, an increase of more than three times compared to the pre-exchange output of 60 jin), but also the entire industry's production is showing prosperity. In addition, the ten businesses including Fushenghao that manufacture starch have been able to avoid losses in their business during the off-season because the Trading Company exchanges white corn for starch. The company is now successively signing contracts with various workshops, with the first batch expected to exchange more than 50,000 jin of starch. (Yu)

    平贸易公司促进出口贸易
    扶助公私营粉坊业
    益农等十六家得到贷款
    【本报讯】北平贸易公司对本市公私营粉坊业开始进行扶植，首批得到贷款的有益农等十六家。该公司为促进出口贸易和供应纺织工业的需要，采用以原料交换产品的方式先后扶植了十六家粉坊业，其中益农（公营）、力生、农工、福盛德、四民、通丰（以上皆私营）等六家，是制造龙口粉丝的。福盛号、三顺兴、德泉涌天泰号、公隆等十家是制造淀粉的。龙口粉丝原产山东龙口，粉质细白精良，为山东特产之一，每年所产除一部销华南外，大部出口输往南洋群岛华侨众多区域，后因日寇侵入，运输不便，该地厂商遂采用平绥沿线宣化等地之绿豆，利用玉泉山之水从事制造。该业鼎盛时代不下百余家，北平解放后，虽还有半数存在，但营业均极萧条，此次经贸易公司以原料换产品的初步扶植下，嗣后又加上是项粉丝出口转趋活跃，不仅益农等六家获得恢复生产的机会，（如福盛德已恢复至原日产量二百五十斤，较交换前产量六十斤增加了三倍多），同时也使得该业生产全部呈现欣荣。另外制造淀粉的福盛号等十家，由于贸易公司以白玉米交换淀粉，而免去因淡月营业上蒙受的损失。现该公司与各作坊陆续签定合同，首批预计交换淀粉五万余市斤。（宇）
