[Jilu Yu Electric] Under the support of the Jilu Yu Trading Company, Yutai County organized disaster-stricken masses for transportation, earning more than 200,000 jin of rice, thus resolving their livelihood problems. It is estimated that there are more than 13,000 disaster victims in Yutai. In January, they engaged in sideline production such as selling manure and firewood. However, after the spring plowing, the manure business declined, and the firewood source was exhausted. Local government and civilian cadres contacted the local trading company, signed a contract, and mobilized a large number of handcarts to transport rice, salt, copper, mats, and other goods for the trading company. The first group of participants consisted of 608 handcarts, which traveled back and forth for four days, earning a total of more than 27,000 jin of rice (about 45 jin of rice per person). The second time they went to Nanle to transport salt, the number of participants increased to 1,790 handcarts. The total amount earned, including the first time, was 200,700 jin of rice and 480 jin of millet. According to the minimum living standard of half a jin of millet per person per day, this could provide for 13,822 people for one month.

　　组织灾民生产自救鱼台赚米二十万斤
    【冀鲁豫电】在冀鲁豫贸易公司扶植下，鱼台县组织灾区群众运输，先后赚米二十余万斤，生活得以解决。鱼台灾民估计约有一万三千余人，一月中，曾进行贩粪、贩柴等副业生产，但春耕过后，粪业萧条，同时柴源亦告枯竭，当地政民干部便和本区贸易公司接洽，订定合同，大量动员小车给贸易公司运米、盐、铜、席等物品。第一次参加运输者共六百零八辆小车，往返四天，共得米二万七千余斤（每人约得米四十五斤）。第二次赴南乐运盐时，就参加了一千七百九十辆小车。连第一次共赚米二十万零七千余斤，谷子四百八十斤。如按照最低生活标准每天每人半斤小米计算，可供一万三千八百二十二人一月之用。
