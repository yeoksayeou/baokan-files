Pingxi Coal Mine Company instructs
  Coal mine fire and housing collapse incidents should focus on subjective self-criticism
    [Reported by this newspaper] Recently, due to successive incidents of house collapses injuring workers and accidental fires at the Mentougou and Xishan coal mines, the Pingxi Coal Mine Company specifically instructed the two mines to conduct a re-examination and called on other coal mines to prevent similar incidents from occurring. According to a report from the Mentougou Coal Mine, the workers' dormitory of the seventh team suddenly collapsed on the 21st of last month, injuring six workers on the spot, one of whom died from serious injuries. At the Xishan Coal Mine, the eighth team leader, Lu Xuefang, and substitute worker, Liu Wenbin, mistakenly connected the electric light to gunpowder, causing a fire that burned down two accounting rooms, 1,600 jin of unpaid wages and rice, and some of the workers' luggage. Although the two mines reported to the company afterwards, they failed to conduct an in-depth self-criticism. The Mentougou Coal Mine even only emphasized objective reasons; therefore, the Pingxi Coal Mine Company specifically pointed out that the self-criticism should focus on the subjective aspects: such as the degree of concern for workers, organizing workers to prevent disasters, etc.

　　平西煤矿公司指示
  　煤矿失火塌房事件应着重从主观检讨
    【本报讯】平西煤矿公司近因门头沟、西山煤矿接连发生房塌砸伤工人及不慎失火事件，特指示该两矿重新检讨，并号召其他煤矿防止此类事件之发生。据门头沟煤矿报告，该矿第七组工人宿舍突于上月二十一日倒塌，当场砸伤工人六名，其中有一人因伤重不治而死。西山煤矿因第八组组长鲁学方、代班工人刘文斌误将电灯与火药接通，发生火灾，烧去帐房两间，未发完之工资米一千六百斤，及工人行李一部。虽然两矿向公司事后作了报告，但未能进行深刻检讨。门头沟煤矿且只强调客观原因；因此平西煤矿公司特着重指出，应从主观上检讨：如对工人的关心程度，组织工人防祸等。　　　　　　　　　　　　　（柏青）
