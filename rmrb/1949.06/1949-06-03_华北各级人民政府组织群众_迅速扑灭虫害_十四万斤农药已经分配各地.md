　　North China's People's Governments at All Levels Organize the Masses
  　Swiftly Eradicate Pests
  　140,000 Jin of Pesticides Have Been Distributed to Various Regions
    [This Newspaper's Report] Pest infestations have occurred throughout North China. Currently, they have spread from 55 counties and one city to 80 counties and four cities. The affected areas encompass Ji Central, Ji South, Taihang, Chahar, Taiyue, Ji East, Ji Lu Yu, Tianjin, Taiyuan, Tangshan, Shijiazhuang, and other regions. People's governments at all levels are organizing all forces to eradicate them. As early as April, 36 counties had already discovered pest infestations, and more have been discovered successively since then. For example, the number of counties infested with red spiders increased from 36 in April to 45 in May, and locust nymphs (hopper) have broken out in six counties: Xingtang, Pingshan, Qian'an, Xiuwu, Longyao, and Yihua. Cotton aphids have broken out in Nanhe, Longyao, and Jize. In Chahar Province's Jingxing, Jizhong's Anci, and the Ji Lu Yu region, from Jining along the canal to ＠shan, a stretch of eighty to ninety *li* long, as well as three low-lying areas in Fanxian to Shouzhhang inside the dyke area, and a 30 *li* long and 5 *li* wide area in Junxian, armyworms have broken out. Mole crickets have broken out in Shanxian, Fanxian, and Shizhuang area of Ji Lu Yu. Fruit tree pests continue to occur as well. For example, fruit trees in Huailai, Huairou, Fangshan, and other areas of Chahar are infested with oriental tent caterpillars and *Malacosoma neustria testacea*, and a sixty *li* long and forty *li* wide jujube forest in Neihuang and surrounding areas of Ji Lu Yu is infested with "Jujube Weevils."
    In addition, many new pests have emerged in May, such as pine caterpillars in Funing, Ji East, which exclusively eat pine trees; snout beetles in Tangshan, which exclusively eat cotton seedlings; *Anomala corpulenta* (Copper Grub) in Qianxi, which exclusively eats pear flowers; longhorn beetles in Changli; midge larvae (local name) in Xiuwu, Taihang; *Ostrinia furnacalis* in Wen'an, Ji Central; *Galeruca daurica* in Qingfeng and Hua County of Ji Lu Yu; and wheat sawflies in Neihuang. In addition to wheat sawflies, *Melolontha* and wireworms also plague wheat in Dingxing, Chahar. According to agricultural scientists' observations of the cyclical nature of locust outbreaks in North China and meteorological observations, a locust plague is very likely to occur this year. In addition, the Si character cotton 2B and 4B promoted this year have the advantages of good quality and high yield, but the Si character cotton also has a shortcoming, almost every year aphids occur.
    People's governments at all levels are organizing all forces to eradicate the above-mentioned pests. After discovering pest disasters, they immediately dispatched cadres and a large number of technical personnel to lead the masses in eradication in a timely manner. For example, the Anyang in Taihang region established a locust eradication headquarters and dispatched 24 cadres to lead the eradication of locusts. After locust nymphs were discovered in Xingtang, 600 people were immediately organized to eradicate them. After pest disasters occurred in Ji Central region, insect eradication headquarters were generally established, and a large number of organized cadres launched a shock to eliminate insects. After fruit tree pests occurred in Chahar, Provincial Government Section Chief Han personally went to the disaster area to lead the masses in eradication. In particular, the technology promotion group used sprayers and pesticides to eliminate many pests, laying the foundation for the masses to believe in using scientific methods to eliminate pests. The Agricultural Department of the North China People's Government has now distributed 140,000 *jin* of pesticides and 1,700 sprayers to various regions. Including the number of medicines and machines in various places, the current situation is sufficient to control pests on one million *mu* of land. All localities should make full use of existing scientific conditions and promote the masses' existing experience, mobilize all forces, and step up the prevention, control, and eradication of pests.

　　华北各级人民政府组织群众
  　迅速扑灭虫害
  　十四万斤农药已经分配各地
    【本报讯】华北各地普遍发生虫害，目前已由五十五个县、一个市蔓延至八十个县、四个市，受灾地区遍及冀中、冀南、太行、察哈尔、太岳、冀东、冀鲁豫、天津、太原、唐山、石家庄等地，各级人民政府正组织一切力量扑灭。自四月份开始，即有三十六个县发现有虫害，以后即陆续发现，如发生红蜘蛛的，四月份有三十六县，五月份又增加九个县，并在行唐、平山、迁安、修武、隆尧、乙化等六县又发生了蝗蝻；南和、隆尧、鸡泽发生棉蚜虫；察哈尔省井陉、冀中安次以及冀鲁豫从济宁沿运河到＠山八、九十里长，范县到寿张堤内地区，浚县长三十里宽五里的三个低洼地带，发生黏虫，在冀鲁豫单县范县和石庄一带发生嵝蛄。果树虫害亦继续发生，如察哈尔怀来、怀柔、房山等地的果树，发生星毛虫、梅毛虫，冀鲁豫内黄一带长六十里宽四十里的枣树林发生“枣步曲”。
    此外五月份还发生了不少的新害虫，如冀东抚宁发生松毛虫，专吃松树，唐山发现象鼻虫，专吃棉花幼苗，迁西发现铜圪螂（姬金龟子），专吃梨花码子，昌黎发现天牛虫，太行修武发现蠕蚊虫（土名），冀中文安发现钻心虫，冀鲁豫清丰、滑县发现黑婆婆虫，内黄发现麦叶蜂，察哈尔定兴除麦叶蜂外尚有金龟子、金针虫为害麦子。据农业科学者从华北蝗虫发生的周期性以及气象观测，今年很可能发生蝗虫。另外今年推广的斯字棉二Ｂ、四Ｂ，品质好产量高是它的优点，但斯字棉也有一个缺点，几乎每年都要发生蚜虫。
    各级人民政府，针对上述虫害情况，正组织一切力量扑灭，发现虫灾后，立即派出干部及大批技术人员及时去领导群众扑灭，如太行区安阳成立剿蝗指挥部，派出廿四个干部领导剿灭蝗虫。行唐发现蝗蝻后，立即组织了六百人进行扑灭。冀中区发生虫灾后普遍成立了灭虫指挥部，大批组织干部突击除虫。察哈尔果树发生虫害后，省府韩处长亲赴灾区领导群众扑灭，特别是技术推广组，用喷雾器、农药，消灭很多害虫，打下群众相信用科学办法消灭虫害的基础。华北人民政府农业部现已经分配各地十四万斤农药，一千七百架喷雾器，连各地共有药械数目，目前情况足可防治一百万亩土地的害虫。各地应充分利用现有的科学条件及发扬群众已有经验，动员一切力量，加紧对害虫的防治及扑灭工作。
