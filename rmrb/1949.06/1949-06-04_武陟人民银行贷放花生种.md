【Taihang Telegram】The Wuzhi branch of the People's Bank of China is issuing peanut seeds to help farmers in disaster areas with production. The area along the Qin River in the county is a vast sandy area, suitable for growing peanuts. However, the people in this area mostly lack the means of production due to years of disasters. The Wuzhi Bank purchased a large batch of peanut seeds from the trade company and focused on providing loans to the most severely affected third and fourth districts, at a rate of fifteen catties per mu, issuing a total of more than 97,200 catties of peanut seeds, which can be used to plant more than 6,400 mu of peanuts. After receiving the concrete assistance from the bank, the masses in the area are actively planting.

　　武陟人民银行贷放花生种
    【太行电】中国人民银行武陟支行，发放花生籽，扶助灾区农民生产。该县沁河沿岸是一片广漠的沙土地带，适宜种植落花生。但该地人民因数年来的灾患，多半缺乏生产资料。武陟银行便由贸易公司购到大批花生种，以水灾最严重的三、四区为重点贷放，每亩十五斤，共发放花生种子达九万七千二百余斤，可以种植花生六千四百余亩。该地群众得到银行的具体扶助后，正积极下种。
