Xinhua News Agency, Hefei, 19th: When the皖北 region was completely liberated, Kuomintang special agents, colluding with secret societies and bandits in areas such as Jiangpu, Mengcheng, Fuyang, and Su County, instigated riots. These have now been completely suppressed by the People's Government through a combination of suppression and appeasement. In March, Kuomintang special agents in Jiangpu County combined with the Knife Society secret society and local ruffians to stage a riot. The People's Government immediately launched widespread propaganda and military suppression. When a unit of the People's Liberation Army counterattacked the rioters, in order to avoid casualties, they fired shots into the air, shouted to persuade them, and distributed propaganda materials exposing the conspiracies and crimes of the Knife Society. As a result, most of the Knife Society members who had been deceived into joining surrendered their knives and disbanded. The few die-hard Knife Society ringleaders were completely eliminated by the PLA's resolute suppression. Those who were captured were screened and educated separately, and then released on bail. The Knife Society riot instigated by Kuomintang bandits in Jiangpu was thus quelled. In early May, the "Tianmen Dadao" in the Mengcheng area, led by the notorious reactionary landlord Li Hongkui, colluded with Kuomintang special agents, forcing the masses to join the organization. After the riot broke out, the Fuyang People's Local Armed Forces immediately carried out suppression and appeasement, capturing 750 people in areas such as Luqiao Zhangcaosi, 30 miles southwest of Mengcheng. The bandit leader Li Hongkui was killed in action. The coerced followers among those captured were all allowed to be released on bail, and those who were injured were sent to hospitals for treatment. On May 9th, in Yangliu and Linhuan districts of Su County, the "Tianmen Dao" also coordinated with small groups of bandits to stage riots, which were quickly suppressed by the Su County Sub-district People's Armed Forces.

　　皖北人民政府剿抚兼施
    平息会门特务武装骚动
    【新华社合肥十九日电】在皖北全部解放时，国民党特务在江浦、蒙城、阜阳、宿县等地曾勾结会门及土匪发生骚动，经人民政府进行剿抚，现已完全扑灭。三月间，江浦县国民党特务分子曾与会门刀会及地痞流氓等结合，发生骚动，人民政府立即进行广泛宣传与军事进剿。解放军某部在反击暴徒攻击时，为了避免伤亡，朝天放枪、喊话争取，并散发宣传品揭露刀会之阴谋与罪行。因此大部分被欺骗参加的刀会会员纷纷交刀散会。少数顽抗不悟的刀会匪首，经解放军坚决的进剿，全部被消灭。其被俘者经分别审查教育，亦先后具保释放，江浦国民党匪徒煽动的刀会骚动至此即告平息。五月上旬蒙城一带的“天门大道”以著名反动地主李洪魁为首，与国民党特务分子结合，强迫群众参加组织。骚动发生后，阜阳人民地方武装立即进行剿抚，在蒙城西南三十里之陆桥张草寺等地俘其七百五十人，匪首李洪魁被击毙。被俘中的胁从分子均准予取保释放，被打伤的则送至医院治疗。五月九日宿县杨柳、临涣两个区亦有“天门道”配合小股土匪发生骚动，均被宿县分区人民武装迅速平息。
