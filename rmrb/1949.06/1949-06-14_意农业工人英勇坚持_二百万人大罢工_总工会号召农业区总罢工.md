Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 13th -- Reports from various sources: The nationwide Italian agricultural workers' general strike, which began on May 18th, is still heroically persisting. The number of strikers has surged to two million. Because the landowners stubbornly refuse the workers' demands, negotiations have consistently failed to reach an agreement. During the strike, landowners and government authorities have used bloody means to suppress striking workers, provoking angry resistance from the striking workers. In Ferrara Province, a large landowner opened fire on strikers, killing one agricultural worker on the spot, but the perpetrator was immediately arrested by the masses and paid for his crime with his life. In a small town in the province, seven agricultural workers were arrested for participating in a demonstration against strike-breakers. When the strikers demanded the immediate release of those arrested, the police threw grenades at the crowd, injuring eight agricultural workers, one of whom was seriously injured and died. Due to the constant provocations by landowners and police, numerous bloody incidents have occurred throughout the country. According to Reuters, the Italian General Confederation of Labor issued instructions on the 11th, calling on agricultural areas nationwide to hold a general strike on the 15th in support of the striking agricultural workers.

    【新华社北平十三日电】各方报道：自五月十八日开始的意大利全国农业工人的大罢工，至今仍在英勇坚持中。罢工人数已猛增至二百万人。由于地主们顽固地拒绝工人的要求，谈判始终未能获得协议。在罢工期间，地主与政府当局以血腥手段镇压罢工工人，引起罢工工人愤怒的反抗。在费拉拉省，一个大地主开枪射击罢工者，当场击毙农业工人一名，但凶犯立即为群众所逮捕，为自己的罪行而偿命。该省某小市镇，有七名农业工人因参加反对破坏罢工者的示威而被捕。罢工者要求立即释放被捕者，警察竟向群众投手榴弹，炸伤农业工人八名，其中一人重伤身死。由于地主与警察的不断挑衅，全国各地已发生多次流血事件。据路透社报道：意大利总工会十一日已发出指示，号召全国农业区于十五日举行总罢工，声援罢工的农业工人。
