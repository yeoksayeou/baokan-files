　　Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 13th: Moscow Dispatch: After receiving the "Declaration of Peace, Friendship, and Cooperation" signed by 130,000 members of the Scottish Trade Union in Britain, the Trade Union of the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic convened mass meetings of trade union members and trade union representatives in the three major industrial cities of Ukraine, Kyiv, Kharkiv, and Lviv, on the 8th and 9th of this month. More than 160,000 people attended these meetings. The meeting discussed the declaration of the Scottish trade union members and passed the Ukrainian trade union's reply to them. The reply first expressed heartfelt brotherly greetings to the advanced representatives of the Scottish working class who proclaimed to defend peace and oppose warmongers. The reply pointed out that the Ukrainian workers, like the people of other Soviet republics, sincerely strive to strengthen and promote comprehensive international cooperation, and strive to coexist peacefully and friendly with the people of Britain and the United States. Because we firmly believe that the friendship of the Soviet, British, and American peoples is the best guarantee of lasting peace. We, the working people of Ukraine, like all the Soviet people, treat the attempts of warmongers to launch a new world war with anger and hatred. We welcome your statement that you will also wage a wholehearted and resolute struggle against the warmongers and thwart the attempts of reactionaries to provoke a third world war with joy.
   The reply continued: Although warmongers are engaged in conspiracies and provocations, the democratic forces of the world are growing stronger day by day. If the people of all countries unite as one to fight the warmongers and express their firm determination to defend peace, then the reactionary forces will not be able to realize their terrible anti-people conspiracies, nor will they be able to plunge mankind into a new slaughterhouse, because if the people are as firm as one in their determination to fight their enemies, then they are invincible.

　　乌克兰职工函复苏格兰工人
    苏英美三国人民的友谊是持久和平的最好保证
    【新华社北平十三日电】莫斯科讯：乌克兰苏维埃社会主义共和国的职工会，在接到英国苏格兰工会十三万会员签名的“和平、友好、合作宣言”以后，已于本月八、九两日在乌克兰的三大工业城市基辅、哈尔科夫及罗夫召开了职工会会员及职工会代表的群众大会，出席这些大会的有十六万人以上。大会讨论了苏格兰职工会会员的宣言，并通过了乌克兰职工会对他们的复信。复信中首先向声言保卫和平、反对战争贩子的苏格兰工人阶级的先进代表致衷心的兄弟敬礼。复信指出：乌克兰的职工象苏联其他加盟共和国的人民一样，真诚地力求加强与促进全面的国际合作，力求与英美人民和平友好共处。因为我们坚信：苏英美三国人民的友谊是持久和平的最好保证。我们乌克兰的劳动人民象全体苏维埃人民一样，以愤怒与仇恨的心情对待战争贩子发动新的世界战争的企图。你们的声明说你们也将对战争贩子进行一心一意的坚决斗争，并将挫败反动分子挑拨第三次世界大战的企图，我们谨以欢欣的心情表示欢迎。
    复信继称：虽然战争贩子进行阴谋与挑拨活动，然而全世界的民主力量仍然与日俱长。如果一切国家的人民团结得象一个人一样对战争贩子进行斗争，并且表示他们保卫和平的坚定决心，那么反动力量便不能实现他们可怖的反人民的阴谋，也不能将人类投入新的屠场，因为人民如果象一个人一样坚定不移地决心对他们的敌人进行斗争，那么他们便是无敌的。
