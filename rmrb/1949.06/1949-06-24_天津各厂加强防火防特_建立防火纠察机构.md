Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, June 23rd. Several factories and enterprises in Tianjin have begun to establish inspection teams and fire prevention organizations. In the past, factories did not pay enough attention to fire prevention. At the end of April and the beginning of May, the city's fire brigade investigated the fire protection equipment of major factories, warehouses, and entertainment venues, and found that most of them were inadequate, and some even had no equipment at all. After this investigation, and under the supervision of the fire brigade, many units have begun to pay attention to fire prevention. China Textile Factory No. 6, the warehouse, and Beiyang Yarn Factory, for example, took the initiative to consult with the fire brigade on fire equipment and the organization and training of fire personnel. In addition to purchasing fire-fighting equipment, the Dongya Tobacco Factory also consulted with the fire brigade to send two members to the factory to cooperate with employees in organizing a fire prevention inspection team, and held exercises in their spare time. The Tram Management Office also organized a worker inspection team in May to patrol day and night, and established a fire brigade of 23 people for protection. Fire prevention organizations in other units have also been established or are being established. Recently, the Military Control Commission's Industry Department and the Tianjin Municipal Government's Public Utilities Bureau have also issued circulars to their subordinate enterprises, urging them to seriously study the lessons learned from the fires in the Beijing Tram Factory and the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant, raise vigilance, and formulate plans to prevent special agents and prevent fires. The Industry Department's circular also requires all units to establish a day and night duty system and a level-by-level leave system, and to send the duty telephone numbers of each unit to the department for supervision and inspection at any time.

    天津各厂加强防火防特
    建立防火纠察机构
    【新华社天津二十三日电】天津部分企业工厂，已开始建立纠察队及防火组织。过去各厂对防火注意很不够。本市消防总队各分队曾于四月底五月初分别调查了各较大工厂、仓库及娱乐场所的消防设备，结果发现大部分不够健全，有的甚至竟无设备。经过这一调查，并在消防总队督促下，许多单位对防火问题已开始注意。中纺六厂，仓库处及北洋纱厂等单位即主动向消防队洽商有关消防设备及组训消防人员问题。东亚烟草厂除购置防火器材外，又商请消防队派队员二人驻厂，配合职工组织防火纠察队，并在工余时间举行演习。电车管理处亦在五月间组织了工人纠察队，昼夜巡逻，并成立了有二十三人参加的消防队，进行防护。其他单位的防火组织亦已建立或正在建立中。最近军管会工业处及津市府公用局又分别通令所属企业单位，认真研究北平电车厂和石景山钢铁厂失火教训，提高警惕，拟定防特防火计划。工业处通令中更要求各单位建立日夜值班制度和按级请假制度，并将各单位值班电话送报该处以便随时督查。
