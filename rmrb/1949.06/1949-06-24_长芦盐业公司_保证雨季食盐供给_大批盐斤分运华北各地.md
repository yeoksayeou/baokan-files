    Large Quantities of Salt Shipped to Various Parts of North China

    [Tianjin Dispatch] In order to guarantee the supply of edible salt in North China during this year's rainy season, the Changlu Salt Industry Company decided to transfer large quantities of salt from the coast in May and June for distribution to various central areas in North China. The first batch of transportation plans was completed on schedule at the end of May, with over 100,800 dan stored and transported along the Zhangjiakou-Datong line, over 131,000 dan along the Shijiazhuang-Taiyuan line, and over 152,000 dan in the Xinxiang, Linqing, and Handan areas. It is expected that the second batch of plans will also be completed ahead of schedule. The current salt reserves in various regions not only provide a certain guarantee for the rainy season supply but also lay a considerable foundation for future edible salt distribution in the entire North China region.

    大批盐斤分运华北各地
    【天津电】为保证本年雨季华北境内食盐供给，长芦盐业公司曾决定在五、六两月份由海滩调运大批盐斤，分运华北各中心地区。第一批调运计划已于五月底按期完成，计张垣大同线已储运十万零八千多担，石家庄太原线十三万一千多担，新乡、临清、邯郸一带十五万二千多担。预计第二批计划亦将提前完成。现各地存盐，不仅对雨季供给有了一定保证，同时也给今后全华北的食盐调剂，打下相当基础。
