Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 17th: TASS Moscow, 15th: *Pravda*'s Paris correspondent, Zhukov, writes that everywhere in Paris, people are discussing the Soviet proposal to the Foreign Ministers' Conference regarding preparations for a German peace treaty. The broad public in Paris is welcoming this proposal, aimed at fulfilling the obligations undertaken by the four powers in Potsdam as soon as possible, with deep satisfaction. Even newspapers like *Combat*, which are not sympathetic to the Soviet Union, believe that signing a peace treaty and withdrawing occupying forces are the best guarantees of international agreement and the most reliable way to finally resolve the conflicts in Germany. *Combat* also wrote: "Western countries... don't like Vyshinsky's proposal."

The representatives of the Western countries treated the Soviet delegation's proposal to expedite the preparation of a German peace treaty with undisguised annoyance. Journalists reported characteristic details of the June 10 meeting of the Foreign Ministers' Conference. It is said that U.S. Secretary of State Acheson, who spoke after Vyshinsky announced the Soviet delegation's proposal, acted very nervously, raising his voice as he spoke, throwing aside the papers he had grabbed, and his reasoning was disorganized. Acheson tried every means to divert attention to issues that were completely unrelated to the Soviet proposal. Acheson apparently understood what impression a direct rejection of the Soviet's precise and clear proposal aimed at concluding a German peace treaty as soon as possible would make on world opinion. That is why he did not directly oppose these proposals but suggested that they be handed over to the Foreign Ministers' assistants for "analysis."

The Parisian public rightly points out that the behavior of the Western countries' delegations at the meeting discussing the Soviet proposal to accelerate the preparation of a German peace treaty has shattered the complex and fragile propaganda facade they have built up over the past three weeks. The situation is this: Acheson—followed by Bevin and Schuman, who from beginning to end were merely echoing the U.S. Secretary of State—has consistently tried to portray things as if they were defending the interests of the German people. At almost every meeting, they have declared that they want to give the German people full power to resolve "their own affairs," want to see the unification of Germany, and so on. However, the Soviet delegation convincingly proved that this statement is false and far from the truth.

Diplomatic circles are repeatedly asking themselves: What exactly do the Western countries' delegations want? Why did they propose convening this Foreign Ministers' Conference in the first place? We have already said that there is an opinion that the Western countries' delegations came to Paris with only one purpose—to put aside the basic issues concerning Germany and to reach an agreement on only one matter, namely, the resumption of trade with East Germany, which is of great concern to German-American trusts in the Western occupation zones—this opinion is becoming increasingly popular among the French public. The impression of the recent meetings confirms this opinion. The representatives of the Western countries are hindering the possibility of reaching agreement on the political and economic unification of Germany, unwilling to discuss the Berlin question, refusing to consider the issue of a single currency in Berlin, and avoiding the study of preparations for a German peace treaty. Judging from many of their newspapers' commentaries, their only interest is in restoring trade between the Eastern and Western occupation zones. Western diplomatic observers, commenting on the progress of the conference, often talk about the West's urgent need to reach an agreement on the issue of inter-zone trade, but at the same time, they frequently emphasize the Western countries' efforts to "maintain the status quo," that is, to allow all the consequences of the division of Germany that they have achieved to remain in effect.

The representatives of the Western countries are not concerned about the fate of the German people, just as they are not concerned about the fate of any people; they are only concerned about the selfish interests of German-American companies seeking markets. They arbitrarily abandon their sacred obligation, undertaken in Yalta and Potsdam, to help the German people to restore economic and political unity—a peaceful and democratic nation. Their rejection of the Soviet proposal to prepare and conclude a German peace treaty as soon as possible exposes them as the enemies of the most rapid conclusion of a peace treaty. What they want is not a unified Germany but a dismembered Germany, and they want to turn the western part of such a Germany into their strategic bridgehead in Europe.

In contrast to this policy is the Soviet Union's consistent, peace-loving policy, aimed at achieving agreement on the basis of the inviolable principles of Yalta and Potsdam. The whole world sees that on every item on the agenda, the Soviet delegation has proposed and is proposing constructive and practical proposals, providing a basis for agreement. It is no accident that the Soviet Embassy in Paris receives piles of letters and telegrams every day. In these letters and telegrams, ordinary people from many countries, especially the people of France, express their gratitude to the Soviet delegation for its outstanding conduct in defending the cause of peace and international cooperation.

The various proposals made by the Soviet delegation at this Foreign Ministers' Conference remain valid. On the basis of these proposals, agreement can be reached on all issues, including economic ones. However, whether agreement can be reached, or whether the three Western countries will once again evade agreement in order to continue their policy of division, depends entirely on the representatives of the Western countries.

　　真理报特派员朱可夫发表评论
  　美英法外长到巴黎来
    不打算解决德国问题
    只图为德美托辣斯寻找出路
    【新华社北平十七日电】塔斯社莫斯科十五日讯：真理报驻巴黎特派员朱可夫写道，巴黎到处在讨论苏联向外长会议提出的关于准备对德和约的建议。巴黎的广大公众，正以深为满意的情绪迎接这一旨在尽早履行四国在波茨坦所承担之义务的建议。甚至象“战斗报”这样从不同情苏联的报纸，也认为签订和约和撤退占领军是国际协议的最好保证，是最后解决德境冲突的最可靠的办法。战斗报同时写道：“西方国家……不喜欢维辛斯基的建议。”
    西方国家的代表，以毫不掩饰的恼怒对待苏联代表团的建议。报界人士报道了外长会议六月十日会议之富有特点的详情。据称，继维辛斯基宣布苏联代表团的建议之后发言的美国国务卿艾奇逊，他的行动很带神经质，他在讲话时提高了嗓子，把抓到的纸张扔在一边，他的说理是杂乱无章的。艾奇逊想尽一切方法企图将注意力转移到与苏联建议毫不相关的问题上去。艾奇逊显然了解，直接拒绝苏联之确切而明白的旨在尽早缔结对德和约的建议，会对世界舆论造成什么印象。这就是为什么他不出而直接反对这些建议而提议把它们交给外长助理们去“分析”的原因。
    巴黎公众充分有根据地指出，西方国家代表团在讨论苏联关于加速准备对德和约建议的会议上的行为，使他们三周来建立起来的复杂而脆弱的宣传牌子垮台。情形是这样的：艾奇逊——跟着他的是贝文与舒曼，他们从头到尾都只是作美国国务卿的应声虫——自始至终一直力图把事情说成好象他们是在保卫德国人民的利益。差不多在每一次会议上，他们都宣布他们想给德国人民以解决“他们自己的事情”的充分权力，想看到德国的统一等等。但是，苏联代表团令人信服地证明，这种说法是虚伪的，远非事实。
    外交界人士一次又一次的自问：西方国家代表团所要的到底是什么？他们提议召开这次外长会议究竟是为了什么？我们已经说过，有一种意见说，西方国家代表团到巴黎来，只带着一个目的——丢开关于德国的基本问题，只在一件事情上，即德国西占区德美托辣斯所极为关切的恢复与东德的贸易一点上取得协议——这种意见在法国公众中间正愈益流行。近来几次会议的印象，证实了这种意见。西方国家的代表们，阻挠在德国政治经济统一问题上获得协议的可能，不愿意讨论柏林问题，拒绝考虑在柏林行使单一货币的问题，规避研究准备对德和约的问题。就他们报章的许多评论来看，他们的兴趣只是在于恢复东西占领区之间的贸易。西方国家外交观察家在评论会议的进程时，常常谈到西方急需在区际贸易的问题上达到协议，但在同时，他们又经常强调西方国家努力“保持现状”，就是说，让他们所实现的德国分裂的一切后果仍然起作用。
    西方国家的代表们，根本不关心德国人民的命运，正象他们不关心一切人民的命运一样；他们所关心的，只是寻找市场的德美公司的自私利益。他们任意地废弃他们在雅尔塔和波茨坦所担承的帮助德国人民从经济上和政治上恢复统一——爱好和平和民主的国家的这一神圣义务。他们拒绝苏联的尽早准备和缔结对德和约的建议，这就暴露了他们自己是最迅速地缔结和约的敌人。他们所要的不是统一的德国而是被肢解的德国，他们想把这样一个德国的西部变成他们在欧洲的战略桥头阵地。
    与这个政策相对抗的，是苏联始终如一的、爱好和平的、旨在以雅尔塔及波茨坦的不可违背的原则为基础获致协议的政策。全世界都看到，在议程的每一项上，苏联代表团都提出并正在提出建设性的切实的建议，提供协议的基础。巴黎苏联大使馆每天都收到成堆的函电，这并不是偶然的。在这些函电中，不少国家的普通人，首先是法国的人民，表示他们对苏联代表团保卫和平与国际合作事业的卓越行为的感激。
    苏联代表团在本届外长会议上所提的各项建议仍然有效。在这些建议的基础上，一切问题都可以得到协议，包括经济问题在内。但是，能不能够获得协议，或者三个西方国家这次是否还要规避协议以继续他们的分裂政策，这完全决定于西方国家的代表。
