　　Former Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu and Jin-Cha-Ji Areas Postage Stamps to be Discontinued by Deadline
    [Ping City News] The various postage stamps issued by the former Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu Border Region and the former Jin-Cha-Ji Border Region are denominated in Ji banknotes and Border Region currency. It is inconvenient to convert and affix them at the current RMB exchange rate. Therefore, the North China Postal and Telecommunications Administration has decided that all post offices shall stop selling various postage stamps with the words "Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu Border Region" and "Jin-Cha-Ji Border Region" printed on them from the date of receiving the order. All institutions, organizations, and people who have purchased and stored the above-mentioned postage stamps should affix them as soon as possible. The deadline is June 30 of this year, and they will be invalid after July 1. Those who continue to use them after the deadline will be handled as underpaid mail. (Xiao Chuan)
