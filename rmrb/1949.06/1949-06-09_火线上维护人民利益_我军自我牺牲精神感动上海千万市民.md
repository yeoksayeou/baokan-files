　　Maintaining the People's Interests on the Front Lines
  　Our Army's Self-Sacrificing Spirit Moves Millions of Shanghai Citizens

    The People's Liberation Army, during its operations in Shanghai's urban areas, exhausted every means possible to protect the city's buildings and the safety of its residents. They did not hesitate to increase the risk of casualties. The 4th Company of the 2nd Battalion of a certain PLA unit, attacking the Xinzha Road Bridge, was blocked by enemy fire from buildings north of the bridge. Six soldiers had already been wounded, and it was necessary to destroy the buildings with artillery fire in order to advance. However, after the regimental commander inquired in detail about the terrain and whether the buildings were public or private property, he sent the deputy regimental commander to observe the area in person. After confirming that artillery fire was necessary, he ordered the artillery: "Only strike the street bunkers, do not hit the buildings next to them." The artillery company commander, after repeated observation, said, "There may be some deviation." The regimental commander finally decided not to use artillery fire, but instead had the battalion commander personally lead a company in a flanking assault. With the cooperation of brother units, they resolved the enemy in the buildings through brave fighting. When attacking the enemy bunker south of the Old Garbage Bridge, the PLA repeatedly considered that artillery fire would not only affect the nearby civilian houses, but also shatter the glass in the nearby civilian houses. Finally, a commando team used high-explosive grenades to independently resolve the bunker. When the advancing route of a certain attacking unit was blocked by enemy fire from the north bank of the Suzhou Creek, the soldiers stuck close to the walls on the side of the road, preferring to let bullets graze their bodies rather than enter the people's houses for cover. Even when a shell exploded next to a soldier, he ignored it. At the south end of the Old Garbage Bridge, five pedestrians were shot down by the bandit troops north of the bridge. The company commander and medic of a certain unit's 1st Company rushed through the enemy's fire blockade to untie their leggings and bandage them. An injured old man asked for water, and the company commander climbed over the fire network to bring him hot water. Lan Fengwen, the political instructor of the 1st Battalion, carried a suitcase for a sick woman, and a signalman went up to help her carry her child, helping her safely escape the fire network. During the street fighting, the PLA, in addition to using the enemy's original fortifications, did not dig fortifications on the roads or the walls of civilian houses. Whenever it was necessary to pass through civilian houses, the soldiers always warned each other: "Don't break the glass." When going up and down the stairs, they reminded each other: "Raise your gun stocks and lighten your footsteps." Some soldiers, even though wounded, remained quietly lying down, not entering civilian houses, nor moaning. The PLA's self-sacrificing spirit in maintaining the people's interests on the front lines deeply moved millions of Shanghai citizens. A citizen named Jin wrote a letter to the PLA saying: "Brothers, in order to protect the lives of the common people, you always try to avoid firing your guns, and bravely advance, taking the sacrifice upon yourselves! This is too sublime, too great, too profound. How can we repay this sincere love?"

### 火线上维护人民利益　我军自我牺牲精神感动上海千万市民

　　火线上维护人民利益
  　我军自我牺牲精神感动上海千万市民
    【新华社上海八日电】人民解放军在上海市区作战时，曾想尽一切办法，保护城市建筑和居民安全。甚至增加伤亡危险，也在所不惜。向新闸路桥攻击的解放军某部二营四连，被桥北楼房守敌的火力封锁前进道路，已有六个战士负伤，必须以炮火摧毁楼房，才能向前推进，但是团长详细地询问了该地地形及楼房属于公产抑或私产后，又派副团长前去实地观察，证实必须炮击，他便命令炮兵“只打街头地堡，不准打着旁边楼房”。炮兵连长反复观察后说：“可能有些偏差”。团长最后还是决定不用炮击，改由营长亲自率领一个连迂回突击，在兄弟部队配合下以勇敢的战斗解决了楼房敌人。当攻击老垃圾桥南边的守敌地堡时，解放军反复考虑到炮击不但会波及旁边民房，而且会震碎附近民房的玻璃，终于改由突击队用烈性手榴弹单独解决了地堡。某攻击部队的前进道路被苏州河北的敌火封锁住时，战士们紧贴在路边墙上，宁愿让子弹从身际擦过，也不进人民房荫蔽。甚至炮弹在一个战士旁边爆炸了，他还是不理会，在老垃圾桥南端，五个行人被桥北匪军打倒了，某部一连连长和卫生员就冲过敌人火力封锁网去，解下绑腿给他们包扎，负伤的老人要水喝，连长又爬过火网给他送热水。一营教导员蓝凤文替一个有病的妇女提了皮箱，通讯员上去帮她抱了小孩，帮助她安全逃过火力网。在＠战中，解放军除了利用敌人原有工事外，都不在马路上和民房墙壁挖工事，每当必须通过民房时，战士们总是互相告诫：“不要碰坏玻璃”。上下楼梯时又互相叮嘱：“提高枪托，放轻脚步。”有的战士虽然负伤，但仍静静地躺着，不进民房，也不呻吟。解放军在火线上维护人民利益而表现的自我牺牲精神，深深地感动了上海千万市民，一个姓靳的市民写信给解放军说：“弟兄们为了顾惜老百姓的性命，总尽量避免放枪，毅然挺胸前进，把牺牲匀给自己！这太崇高、太伟大、太深厚了，这种诚挚的爱，我们怎样才能报答得了呢？”
