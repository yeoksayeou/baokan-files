Vyshinsky pointed out that the US delegation insisted on removing Article 36 from the provisional constitution of Greater Berlin passed in 1946. This article states that all decrees formulated by the City Council and all decrees and orders issued by the City Government must comply with the laws and orders of the Allied authorities in Germany and the Four-Power Command of Greater Berlin, and must be approved by the latter. Vyshinsky said that the Soviet Union could not agree to the US proposal to remove Article 36, which reduces the role of the Four-Power Command in Berlin's administration and is inconsistent with the significance of the Four-Power Command as the body responsible for the Berlin situation and its administrative affairs. Vyshinsky also pointed out that although the Soviet Union insisted that Article 36 should remain in the provisional constitution of Greater Berlin, it also believed that it was necessary to make some amendments to this article. According to the Soviet proposal, only those decrees enacted by the Berlin City Council and the City Government of Greater Berlin that relate to matters within the jurisdiction of the Four-Power Command should be submitted to the Four-Power Command for approval, but such issues are few.

Vyshinsky then discussed the issue of the functions and powers of the city-wide Berlin government. He said that the Soviet Union had suggested that the following matters be placed under the jurisdiction of the City Council and the City Government: supply issues, city-wide financial issues, including the city-wide budget, loan issues, price and tax issues, fuel issues, transportation issues, traffic issues (postal services, telegrams, telephones), police and maintenance of law and order, foreign trade issues, appointment, removal, and transfer of important executives of Berlin's city-wide administrative organs, housing construction issues, local affairs, cultural issues, legal issues, education and art issues, public health issues, labor issues, personnel issues, social security issues, public utilities and municipal enterprises, and commercial and industrial issues. Vyshinsky emphasized that according to the proposal of the Soviet delegation, many of these issues should be entirely under the jurisdiction of the City Council and the city-wide Berlin government. The Four-Power Command should only review such issues if any of the Four-Power Commanders objects to the decisions passed by the City Council and the Greater Berlin City Government. If the Four-Power Command disagrees on how to handle these issues, the issues must be submitted to a higher body for consideration and resolution, and should not be made public until an agreement is reached.

Vyshinsky recalled the US proposal to apply the system used in Austria to Berlin. In Austria, the actions of the Austrian government are considered approved if they are not opposed by the Allied authorities within a certain period. The US delegation had suggested that legislative decrees and orders of the Greater Berlin authorities on a wide range of issues should also come into effect if they were not opposed by the Four-Power Command within twenty-one days of their submission to the Command.

Vyshinsky said that the Soviet Union could not agree to this proposal because the current situation in Austria is different from that in Germany. Austria is not treated as a defeated enemy; the agreement on the control mechanism for Austria was signed as early as 1946; there is already a government there recognized by the Soviet Union, the United States, Britain, and France. However, the control mechanism in Germany, including Berlin, is based on different foundations than the control mechanism in Austria. This is specifically reflected in the regulations of the Four-Power Command in Berlin and the 1946 Berlin Constitution.

Vyshinsky also suggested that the newly elected Berlin City Council be authorized to draft a new constitution for Greater Berlin in accordance with the provisions of the 1946 Berlin Provisional Constitution.

　　恢复柏林市府　应举行全市性自由选举
  　美国竟建议施用奥境管制方法
    维辛斯基指出，美国代表团坚持从一九四六年通过的大柏林临时宪法中除去第三十六条。该条说，市议会所制订的一切法令以及市政府所颁布的法令与命令，必须符合德境盟国当局与大柏林四国司令部的法律与命令，并必须为后者所批准。维辛斯基说，苏联不能同意美国的除去第三十六条的建议，这一建议降低了四国司令部在柏林行政上所起的作用，与四国司令部之作为负责柏林局势及其行政事务之机构的意义不符。维辛斯基又指出，苏联虽然坚持第三十六条应保持在大柏林临时宪法之内，但也认为有必要对这一条作某些修改。根据苏联的建议，只有柏林市议会与市政府所订立的有关四国司令部权限之内的问题的那些法令，才应交由四国司令部批准，但这种问题是不多的。
    维辛斯基继而论列柏林全市范围市政府的职权问题，他说，苏联曾建议，将下述事务置于市议会与市政府的权限之内的供应问题，全市性的财政问题，包括全市性的预算在内，贷款问题，物价和税收问题，燃料问题，运输问题，交通问题（邮政、电报、电话），警察及维持法律与秩序的问题，对外贸易问题，柏林全市范围之行政机构的重要执行人员的任免及调任的问题，房屋建筑问题，地方性的事务，文化问题，法律问题，教育和艺术问题，公共卫生问题，劳工问题，人事问题，社会治安问题，公用事业及市营企业问题，商业和工业问题。维辛斯基着重指出：按照苏联代表团的建议，这些问题中许多都应该完全置于市议会及柏林全市范围市政府的管辖之下。四国司令部只有在四国司令有任何一人反对市议会及大柏林市政府所通过的决定时，才审议这种问题，如遇四国司令部对处理这些问题的意见分歧时，则问题必须交与更高级的机构去考虑，到那里去解决，且在达成协议之前不公布。
    维辛斯基追述美国建议将奥境所使用的制度应用到柏林。在奥国，奥国政府的行动如果在一定期间不遇盟国当局的反对，便被认为已获批准。美国代表团曾建议大柏林当局有关广泛范围的问题的立法法令及命令，如果在提交司令部后二十一天内未遭四国司令部的反对，便也自行生效。
    维辛斯基说：苏联不能同意这种建议，因为奥国的现存情况与德国的不同。奥国不被当作被击败的敌国；关于对奥管制机构的协定、一九四六年就签了字；那里已经有了苏、美、英、法所承认的政府。而德境的管制机构包括柏林的在内，却是建立在与奥境管制机构不同的基础之上。这具体反映在柏林四国司令部的条例及一九四六年柏林的宪法上面。
    维辛斯基又建议：新选出的柏林市议会，将授权按照一九四六年柏林临时宪法的规定起草大柏林新宪法。
