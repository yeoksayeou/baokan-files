    [This Newspaper's Dispatch] In order to strengthen the reporting on workers' production, study, and living conditions, and to listen to workers' hopes for "China Youth," the organ of the Central Committee of the China New Democratic Youth League, "China Youth," held a workers' symposium at 17 East Chang'an Street at 7:00 p.m. the day before yesterday (the 8th). Seventy workers from various public factories in the city of Beijing attended. Yang Shu, Minister of Propaganda of the Central Committee of the Youth League, first gave a speech, explaining the direction of "China Youth" and hoping that workers would write more articles and offer more suggestions. The workers present stood up one after another to speak about what they hoped would be reported, and requested "China Youth" to guide their study and help them write articles. Everyone especially requested more introductions to Soviet construction and Soviet workers' labor competitions. Comrade Feng Wenbin, Secretary of the Central Committee of the Youth League, also rushed to participate. The workers excitedly raised various questions to him, and Comrade Wenbin answered them one by one. He also used his own experience of learning to write as a member of the working class to encourage the workers to write articles.
