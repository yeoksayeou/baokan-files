[JiZhong Electric] In order to support production and meet the needs of the military, civilians, government offices, schools, and factories, the Pingjin Coal and Iron Company has established a branch in Baoding City, which officially began operations on June 1st. A large quantity of coal, iron ore raw materials, and various agricultural implements have been transported from state-owned enterprises in Kailuan, Mentougou, Yangquan, Jingxing, and other places. The sales price is 8% lower than the market price; the products are promoted to villages and communities in various parts of central Hebei through the Central Hebei Supply and Marketing Cooperative. Private iron factories in various regions are provided with appropriate raw material assistance based on the principle of equivalent value and mutual benefit, and they are also helped to promote their finished products. Currently, the company is actively investigating the agricultural tools and other necessities that farmers in various regions lack, so as to carry out business extensively and systematically.
