[This City News] The All-China Federation of Trade Unions recently responded to an inquiry from the Preparatory Committee of the Central Plains Federation of Trade Unions regarding the question: "Independent laborers, such as rickshaw pullers with their own rickshaws, handcart pullers, masons with their own tools, barbers, etc., are they qualified to join a trade union?" The reply is as follows:

(1) A trade union is a mass organization of the working class, that is, all employed laborers who rely on selling their labor power (whether mental or physical) as the whole or main source of living for themselves and their families, regardless of whether they are politically progressive or backward, and regardless of ethnicity, gender, religion, belief, and who voluntarily join the union with agreement to the union's aims, can be admitted as trade union members. Conversely, those who do not rely on selling their labor power and receiving wages or salaries, but rely on their own possession of certain means of production, selling their labor products for a living as independent small producers, such as farmers and small handicraftsmen, cannot be admitted as trade union members. The term "independent laborer" is unscientific and should not be used.

As for those mentioned in the telegram: rickshaw pullers with their own rickshaws, handcart pullers, masons with their own tools, barbers, etc., although they possess simple means of production, they all rely on selling their labor power rather than relying on selling labor products for a living. As long as they agree with the union's aims and voluntarily go through the membership procedures, they can be admitted as trade union members. If one pulls their own rickshaw and at the same time rents out rickshaws to others, receiving rental income, then it should be determined whether selling one's own labor power is the main source of one's livelihood, or whether rental income is the main source. If the latter is the main source, then they should not be admitted to the trade union.

　　占有工具的黄包车夫等是否有资格参加工会？
    中华全国总工会答中原问
    【本市讯】中华全国总工会顷对中原总工会筹委会电询：“独立劳动者。如自有车子的黄包车夫、手推车夫、自有工具之泥水匠、理发匠等，是否有资格参加工会”的问题答复如下：
    （一）工会是工人阶级的群众组织，即凡是以出卖劳动力（不管是脑力劳动或体力劳动）为自己及其家庭生活资料之全部或主要来源的雇佣劳动者，不论在政治上是进步的或落后的，不分民族、性别、宗教、信仰、赞成工会的宗旨自愿入会者，即可吸收为工会会员。反之，凡不是依靠出卖劳动力，领取工资薪金为生的雇佣劳动者，而是依靠自己占有一定的生产资料，出卖劳动生产品为生的独立的小生产者，例如农民和小手工业者，即不能吸收为工会会员。“独立劳动者”这个名词是不科学的，不要采用这个名词。
    来电所指：自有车子之黄包车夫、手推车夫、自有工具之泥水匠、理发匠等，虽占有简单的生产工具，但都是依靠出卖劳动力而不是依靠出卖劳动生产品为生，只要他们赞成工会宗旨，自愿依照入会手续入会者，即可吸收为工会会员。如果自己拉自己的车，同时又还有车租给别人，收入租金，则应视自己出卖劳动力为其生活资料之主要来源，抑或以租金收入为主要来源来决定。如系后者为主，则不应吸收加入工会。
