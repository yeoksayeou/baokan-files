The Completion of Spring Planting in the Taihang Region
    The Office of the Taihang District Committee of the Chinese Communist Party

    I. General Planting Situation

    Since the beginning of spring, the planting of crops throughout the region has generally been completed on schedule, with the exception of late crops and a small number of areas where millet has not yet been sown due to drought. According to incomplete statistics, the region has a total cultivated area of over 20,051,700 mu, of which over 13,481,100 mu have been sown with millet, beans, corn, sorghum, etc.; 1,350,000 mu with cotton, exceeding the original plan by 150,000 mu; over 112,900 mu with hemp; over 94,800 mu with flax; and over 123,500 mu with peanuts. The area not yet sown, including 6,558,000 mu of wheat stubble land (mostly sown after the wheat harvest) and 378,200 mu of late autumn crops such as naked oats, buckwheat, and autumn vegetables (sown during the Minor Heat and Summer Solstice solar terms). The seedlings in the sown areas have emerged one after another. The focus of agricultural production activities in the region has shifted to the stage of hoeing seedlings, in addition to continuing to sow late crops.

    II. Experiences in Completing Planting

    First, preparations for spring plowing began early. In terms of technical preparation: autumn plowing last year reached an average of 83 percent of the cultivated area throughout the region. From last winter to this spring, efforts were intensified to accumulate fertilizer. For example, according to statistics from 313 villages in Licheng, Pingshun, and Changzhi counties, over 16,990,000 dan of fertilizer were accumulated last winter, and over 16,139,000 dan were accumulated this spring. The average amount per mu reached 62 dan, which was delivered to the fields at the beginning of spring, giving the masses more time to repair field borders and build embankments. In Linxian County, 12 villages rebuilt 107,000 zhang of field embankments that had collapsed for many years, and Zhuangshang Village in Shexian County reclaimed over 10,000 mu of滩地 (beach or river terrace land). In terms of ideology: the policies of correcting deviations, universally issuing land certificates, stabilizing land rights, and encouraging farmers to work hard, become prosperous, and enrich themselves dispelled the masses' concerns about production and stimulated their enthusiasm for production.

    Second, organization overcame the difficulties of labor and livestock power. According to a survey of 13 villages in eight counties, among 9,376 households with 31,762 mu of land, households with both labor and livestock accounted for 42.7 percent (more than half only had one animal), accounting for 57.3 percent of the land; households with labor but no livestock accounted for 31.85 percent, accounting for 26.7 percent of the land. Households with livestock but no labor accounted for 5.25 percent, accounting for 5.4 percent of the land. Households with neither labor nor livestock accounted for 20.2 percent, accounting for 10.6 percent of the land. If organization was not relied upon, it would obviously be impossible to complete planting smoothly. This spring, in implementing the policy of organization, the previous set of forced compilation and formalism was opposed, and diverse forms of small-scale, flexible, and truly voluntary combinations of the masses were promoted. The scale of mutual aid was not only not inferior to previous years, but on the contrary, it expanded. For example, in Xishu Village in Shexian County, out of a total of 461 households, over 70 percent participated in mutual aid.

    Third, the leadership actively led the masses to fight against natural disasters. This spring, rainfall was generally lacking. The entire region only experienced two relatively widespread rainfalls in early April and mid-May (but the distribution was very uneven). Overcoming drought was a crucial key to ensuring planting. The entire region made the following efforts in drought resistance and planting: (1) Seizing the opportunity to plant after rainfall. For example, in Shahe County, after a two-finger rainfall in early April, all cadres in the county were mobilized to lead the masses to rush plant over 120,000 mu in two days. (2) Carrying water to plant. For example, in the Xingtai area, over 100,000 mu of cotton were planted by carrying water. (3) Digging canals and wells. According to incomplete statistics, a total of 2,933 wells were dug throughout the region, exceeding the original plan by 1,133, and 1,117 waterwheels were added, increasing paddy fields by over 59,000 mu (excluding the Fourth Sub-region). On May 14, a frost disaster occurred in some areas of Shanxi. After the greatest efforts, over 900,000 mu of seedlings that had been frozen to death were replanted or replaced with other crops. Along with the drought came the prevalence of diseases. In order to protect labor and livestock, medical teams were generally organized in various places to go to the countryside to help the masses eliminate diseases. In the Zuoquan area alone, the counties organized a total of 850 doctors of both Chinese and Western medicine, and launched a disease prevention and treatment campaign in conjunction with the broad masses. The Xingtai area discovered livestock plague. The veterinary treatment team from the Huabei Agricultural College set out on May 1st and, in Nantianwang and other villages, injected a total of 606 head of livestock and treated 422 sick livestock using methods such as oral medication and acupuncture within nine days, earning the enthusiastic support of the masses.

    Fourth, the state-owned economy actively supported the production of the masses. The Taihang branch of the People's Bank of China issued a total of 70 million yuan in agricultural loans this spring, which has generally achieved results. According to incomplete statistics in April, over 3.76 million yuan was loaned for livestock in 23 counties, purchasing 609 head of livestock (the entire region increased livestock by 12,190 head), including 106 head of breeding stock. Loans were also provided for agricultural tools and seeds. The Taihang Trading Company purchased a large quantity of red alum, facilitating pest control and seedling protection for the masses.

    Fifth, the leadership must pay close attention to inspections, and party branch members must play a model role. The focus of work throughout the region shifted to production in February. In March, a thorough spring plowing mobilization was carried out throughout the region; in April, the deviation of empty talk was overcome, and attention was turned to organizing and leading the masses in practical action. At the beginning of May, a large-scale inspection campaign was launched throughout the region, with 542 inspection teams going to the countryside to promote the completion of drought resistance and planting. The exemplary activities of party branch members in spring planting were generally good.

    III. Issues to be Noted in the Future

    First, we must attach importance to the development of the seedling protection campaign. Currently, most of the seedlings have emerged, but the threat of drought and pests is still great. How to protect seedlings has been placed on the important agenda of agricultural production leadership. The entire region has indeed made achievements in developing water conservancy in the spring, but there is still a gap compared to our original plan. For example, the original plan was to increase waterwheels by 2,888, but only 1,117 have been completed. The original plan was to increase paddy fields by 148,678 mu, but only 59,094 mu have been completed. Therefore, continuing to dig canals and wells and expand paddy fields is an important means of drought resistance and increased production. Pests have been discovered to varying degrees in various places. Currently, the newly emerged locust nymphs in Xiuwu, Huojia, Cixian, and Linxian counties are the most serious. If they are not caught and killed when they are small and few, it will inevitably lead to great harm. The proverb says, "Hoe one more time, increase half of the yield." This shows the importance of hoeing seedlings. How to mobilize all forces and strive to hoe more land one more time is of great significance for increasing production this year.

    Second, we must attach importance to the guidance of agricultural production technology. This point is being neglected by many of our comrades, but it is demanded by the broad masses. For example, in Wulihou Village in Zuoquan, after the seedlings were frozen, the masses were uncertain whether to replant the damaged corn or not, and urgently requested technical guidance. However, our branch comrades did not concentrate on this demand of the masses and provide guidance. They only knew to gather the masses at night to hold meetings and talk emptily about the importance of increasing production. Some households listened to the advice of experienced people and did not replant, and the seedlings revived on the third day; some households did not have anyone to guide them, so they all replanted, suffering some losses. From this, it can be seen that the masses are demanding technical guidance. Governments at all levels should establish agricultural technology guidance committees, especially in the villages, and recruit experienced people to participate in the technical guidance committees. Empty so-called "political" leadership is not enough. For example, Gan Zhao Gengzi in Xia Guihua, Licheng District, held 14 meetings in 13 days, and the head of the county cooperative section held 10 meetings in a village in four days, which was not only useless, but also harmed production.

    Third, we must attach importance to the leadership of the spontaneous mutual aid and cooperation of the masses, so as to give it a greater role. After the forced compilation and formalism of mutual aid was overthrown, the spontaneous mutual aid of the masses became very widespread. Its forms are many and varied, with some having many people, some having few, some being combinations of soldiers against soldiers and generals against generals; some being purely kinship-based combinations; and some being livestock-based combinations. Among them, some have group leaders, some do not have group leaders, some use wage standards, and some use work exchanges for work. In short, the forms are diverse, so the members involved are also extremely broad. Their common characteristics are: truly voluntary, mutually beneficial, and conducive to the development of each other's production; another characteristic is that every mutual aid group, no matter how large or small, has one or two natural core figures as its link. The responsibility of our leadership is not to overthrow this kind of organization of the masses and come up with another set, but to recognize and support this mutual aid, unite the core figures in it, or use the actions of party members to influence it, and voluntarily realize the Party's call for increased production through them. This is called leadership. Because many cadres still do not understand this point, they either ignore the spontaneous mutual aid of the masses; or overthrow it and come up with another set according to their subjectivity. Both of these deviations are wrong.

　　太行区农业播种完成经过
    中共太行区党委办公室
    一、一般播种情况
    开春来至现在，全区农作物播种，除晚庄稼及极少一部分地区因旱谷子尚未下种外，其余一般都按时下种了。据不完全统计全区共有耕地面积二千零五十一万七千余亩，已下种的谷、豆、玉茭、高粱………等一千三百四十八万一千余亩；棉花一百三十五万亩，超过原计划十五万亩；大麻十一万二千九百余亩；小麻九万四千八百余亩；花生十二万三千五百余亩。未下种的，包括麦茬地六百五十五万八千余亩（大部麦收后才种），莜麦、荞麦、秋菜等晚秋作物三十七万八千二百余亩（小暑夏至节令才种）。下种了的地，小苗已先后出土，全区农业生产活动，除继续播种晚庄稼外，重点已转入锄小苗阶段。
    二、完成播种的经验
    第一、春耕准备工作着手较早。在技术准备方面：去年秋耕地全区平均达耕地面积百分之八十三，去冬今春又抓紧了积肥，如黎城、平顺、长治三个县、三百一十三个村统计，去冬共积肥一千六百九十九万余担，今春又积肥一千六百一十三万九千余担。每亩平均达六十二担，一开春便送到了地里，群众有了较从容的时间进行修边垒堰。林县十二个村垒好塌倒多年的地堰达十万七千丈，涉县庄上村修滩地一万余亩。在思想方面：经过纠偏、普发土地证、稳定地权、鼓励农民勤劳生产、发家致富的政策，解除了群众生产上的各种顾虑，激发了群众生产积极性。
    第二、组织起来克服了劳畜力困难。据八个县十三个村的调查，共九千三百七十六户，土地三万一千七百六十二亩，其中劳畜力俱全的户占百分之四十二点七（只有一个牲口的有半数以上），土地占百分之五十七点三；有劳力无畜力的户占百分之三十一点八五，土地占百分之二十六点七。有畜力无劳力的户占百分之五点二五，土地占百分之五点四。劳畜力俱无的户，占百分之二十点二，土地占百分之十点六。若不靠组织起来，要想顺利的完成播种，显然是不可能的。本年春在贯彻组织起来政策上，反对了已往强迫编制形式主义的一套，发扬了小型灵活真正为群众自愿结合的多种多样的形式。互助规模不但不逊于往年，相反扩大了。如涉县西戍村共四百六十一户，参加互助的占全村户数百分之七十以上。
    第三、领导群众向自然灾害作了积极的斗争。今春雨水普遍缺少，全区只在四月上旬及五月中旬较普遍的落了两次雨（但分布很不均），战胜旱灾是保证下种的重要关键。全区在抗旱下种方面，曾作了如下努力：（一）趁雨抢种。如沙河县在四月上旬，落了二指雨后，全县干部全体出动，两天即领导群众抢种十二万余亩。（二）担水点种。如邢台专区担水点种棉花十万余亩。（三）开渠凿井。全区不完全统计，共凿井二千九百三十三眼，超过原计划一千一百三十三眼，增加水车一千一百一十七辆，增加水田五万九千余亩（缺四分区）。五月十四日山西部分地区，发生冻灾，经过最大努力，九十余万亩被冻死的小苗，完成了补种改种。随天旱而来的是疾病流行，为了保护劳力与畜力，各地都普遍组织了医疗队，下乡帮助群众扫除疾病，仅左权专区各县共组织了中西医生八百五十名，结合广大群众开展了防疫治疗运动。邢台专区发现牲口瘟，华大农学院兽医治疗队五月一日出发，在南天汪等村，九天内共注射牲口六百零六头，用服药扎针等方法治疗好病牲口四百二十二头。博得了群众热烈的拥护。
    第四、国营经济积极进行了对群众生产的扶植。中国人民银行太行分行，本年春季农业贷款，共放人民币七千万元，已普遍获得了成绩。据四月份不完全统计，二十三个县牲口贷款三百七十六万余元，买到牲口六百零九头（全区共增牲口一万二千一百九十头），内有种畜一百零六头。并有农具种子等贷款。太行贸易公司购买大批红矾，便利了群众除虫保苗。
    第五、领导上要抓紧检查，支部党员起模范作用。全区在二月份工作中重心即转上了生产。三月份全区进行了深入的春耕大动员；四月份克服了空叫的偏向，转向了重视组织领导群众实际行动，五月初全区开展了大检查运动，五百四十二个检查队下乡，推动完成了抗旱播种。支部党员在春季播种中的模范活动一般都不错。
    三、今后应注意的问题
    第一、必须重视保苗运动的开展。目前小苗已大部出土，但旱灾与虫害给我们的威胁还很大，如何保苗，已被提到农业生产领导的重要日程。全区在春季发展水利确有成绩，但与我们原计划还有距离，如原计划增加水车二千八百八十八辆，现只完成一千一百一十七辆。水田原计划增加十四万八千六百七十八亩，现只完成五万九千九十四亩。因此继续开渠凿井，扩大水田，是抗旱增产的重要手段。虫害在各地或轻或重都曾发现，目前尢以修武、获嘉、磁县、林县等新出土的蝗蝻最为严重，若不乘小、乘少，进行捕打，必将招致大害。谚云“多锄一遍，增加成半。”足可见锄苗之重要。如何动员一切力量，争取更多的土地多锄一遍，对今年增产，有很大的意义。
    第二、必须重视农业生产技术的指导。这点正为我不少同志所忽视；但它却又为广大群众所要求。如左权五里堠村，小苗被冻后，群众对冻坏的玉茭改种还是不改种？拿不定主意，急迫要求技术指导。但我们的支部同志，却没有集中群众这种要求加以指导，每日夜间只知集合群众开会空讲增产的重要，有些户听了有经验的人的话，没有改种，第三日小苗又复活了；有些户则没有人指导，便都重种了，吃了些亏。从此可看出群众是要求技术指导的。各级政府应该成立农业技术指导委员会，尤其在村里网罗生产有经验的人，参加技术指导委会，非常需要，空洞的所谓“政治”领导是不行的。如黎城区干赵更子在下桂花，十三天开十四个会，县合作科长在一村四天开十个会，不但没有用处，反而损害了生产。
    第三、必须重视群众中自发的互助合作的领导，使之发挥更大的作用。强迫编制形式主义的互助被推翻以后，群众中自发的互助非常广泛。其形式有人多的，有人少的，有的是兵对兵将对将的结合；有的是纯亲戚关系的结合；有的是以牲口为主的结合。其中有的有组长，有的没有组长，有的用工资标准，有的则是工变工。总之形式是多种多样的，所以卷入的成员也是极为广泛的。其共同的特点是：真正自愿，互助互利，有利于彼此发展生产；另一个特点是每一个互助集团不论大小，其中都有一个至两个的自然核心人物作维系。我们领导上的责任，并不是打倒群众这种组织而另来一套，应该是承认、赞助这种互助，团结其中核心人物，或以党员的行动去影响它，将党的增产号召，经过他们自愿的去实现。这就叫领导。这点因为还有不少干部不了解，所以对群众中自发着的互助，不是不理睬；便是打倒，照其主观另来一套。这两种偏向都是不对的。
