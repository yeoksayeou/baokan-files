Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 25th: State-owned industries in Rehe Province have been actively restored by the People's Government over the past two years and now have taken initial shape. The industrial conference held last month decided that in the future, various industries will continue to be developed under the principles of meeting the needs of the national economy and the people's livelihood, where conditions are possible, and with long-term prospects. Rehe Province is rich in mineral resources such as gold, silver, coal, iron, lead, zinc, and asbestos, but its industry is extremely backward. During the puppet Manchukuo period, gold, iron, and coal mines, as well as the electricity industry, were developed. After the Japanese surrender, the above-mentioned enterprises were mostly destroyed by the Kuomintang bandit troops. Currently, in addition to the restored coal and gold mines, and power plants, eight new state-owned factories have been built for ironwork, textiles, woolen textiles, glass materials, leather, matches, soap, and printing.

Besides the Beipiao mine, the four largest coal mines in Rehe Province are Ying-shou-ying-zi in Xinglong County, Da-miao in Longhua County, and Yuan-bao-shan in Chifeng County. These four mines began producing coal successively from April of last year to February of this year. Currently, due to the mechanical equipment not yet being fully restored, the output is relatively low.

Gold mining areas are distributed in nineteen counties. Mining began during the Qing Dynasty. In July of last year, the People's Government established the Gold Mine Administration to unify operations, and most of the mines have now been restored to operation.

The province's electricity industry originally had six plants in Chifeng, Beipiao, Chengde, and Lingyuan. Four plants have now been restored. Among them, the Chengde Power Plant is the largest, with a power generation capacity of 3,000 kilowatts.

The eight state-owned factories for ironwork, textiles, and glass materials have a total of more than 4,500 employees. The iron factory mainly produces farm tools and various small tools, and it is planned to trial-produce new-style farm tools in the future. The textile factory, however, has limited prospects for development due to the lack of local cotton production and inconvenient transportation.

The current difficulties for various factories are inconvenient transportation, which affects sales; some factories are experiencing difficulties with capital turnover. At the provincial industrial conference held last month, the erroneous views of some cadres who lacked confidence in the development of the province's industry were corrected. The People's Government has also decided to invest heavily and find ways to assist various factories in solving the above-mentioned difficulties.

　　热河丰富的矿藏大部已恢复开采
    【新华社沈阳二十五日电】热河省营工业最近两年来经人民政府积极恢复，现已粗具规模。上月举行的工业会议决定今后将在国计民生需要、条件可能、有远大前途等原则下继续发展各项工业。热省金、银、煤、铁、铅、锌、石棉等矿产蕴藏丰富，但工业极为落后。伪满时曾开发金、铁、煤矿及电业等项，日寇投降后，上述企业多遭国民党匪军破坏。现在已恢复的企业除煤、金等矿及发电厂外，又新建了铁工、纺织、毛织、玻璃料器、皮革、火柴、肥皂、印刷等八个省营工厂。热河煤矿除北票矿外，以兴隆县鹰手营子、隆化县大庙、赤峰县元宝山等四矿较大。该四矿于去年四月至今年二月先后开始出煤。目前因机械设备尚未恢复，产量较低。金矿产区分布于十九个县份。满清时代即开始开采。去年七月人民政府设金矿管理局统一经营，现已大部恢复开采。全省电业，原有赤峰、北票、承德、凌源等六个厂，现已恢复四个厂。其中以承德发电厂规模最大，发电量为三千基罗瓦特。省营的铁工、纺织、玻璃料器等八个厂，共有职工四千五百多人。铁工厂主要生产农具和各种小型工具，今后拟试制新式农具。纺织厂则因当地不产棉、交通不便等原因，发展前途不大。各厂目前困难为交通不便，影响销路；有的厂则感资金周转困难。上月召开的全省工业会议上纠正了某些干部对发展该省工业缺乏信心的错误观点，人民政府并决定大量投资，设法协助各厂解决上述困难。
