Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, May 31st: TASS, Bombay, reports: The annual meeting of the All India Trade Union Congress (AITUC) was held in Bombay on the 28th. More than 700 delegates attended, representing Calcutta, Cambay, Delhi, Bombay, Kombo, Sholapur, and many other cities and industrial areas of India. Due to the government's persecution of the AITUC, the congress was held in a tense political atmosphere: many leaders of the AITUC are currently detained in prison; the AITUC General Secretary Gandhi was arrested on the eve of the annual meeting. Police authorities placed numerous restrictions on the work of the annual meeting, only allowing delegates to meet behind closed doors, without the right to invite guests or observers, and not allowing the organization of local Bombay workers' gatherings or demonstrations. Slogans were posted in the meeting hall, stating the current political and economic demands of the Indian proletariat: "We demand that all basic industries be nationalized, foreign capital confiscated, and the land ownership system of feudal landlords abolished," "Workers are fighting for stable living wages, for the right to work, the right to strike, and civil liberties," "Smash the imperialists' conspiracy to plot a Third World War," "Down with the North Atlantic Treaty," "Sever all relations with the British Empire," "Defend peace, oppose warmongers." The congress, amidst enthusiastic applause and repeated shouts of "Long live the Soviet Union," read out the congratulatory message from the Central Committee of the All-Union Central Council of Trade Unions. The congress also read out congratulatory messages from the World Federation of Trade Unions and the progressive trade unions of Italy, France, Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, and Poland.

　　Congress Chairman Chariar urged all trade union members in India and all the people of India to intensify their struggle to defend peace and oppose imperialist war instigators. Chariar strongly condemned the Indian government for persecuting progressive trade union central and local organizations under the so-called "Public Safety Maintenance Act."

　　Amir Hyuson, representing the All India Trade Union Congress Organizing Committee, reported: "In the past two years since the closing of the last AITUC congress, Indian workers have been resolutely and fiercely fighting against the increasingly fierce exploitation by the Indian bourgeoisie. Workers in all industrial sectors of India have been involved in this struggle. The March strike of 40,000 textile workers in Cambay, the two-month strike of 30,000 workers in Nagpur, the strike of miners in Bihar, the strike of tram workers in Calcutta and transport workers in Madras Province, and the heroic strike of railway workers in South Deccan, Assam, and Hyderabad – these are all strikes that the entire Indian proletariat still remembers." The report detailed many facts of the Indian government's persecution of progressive trade unions in India.

　　Amir Hyuson declared that more than 25,000 activists in the Indian trade union movement, peasant movement, student movement, and other people's movements are now being detained in prisons. Those detained include AITUC Chairman Dange, Vice-Chairmen Mirakar and Yusuf. Leaders of the Indian working class, Dulkarni, Bharatwaji, Malik Shahib, etc., have died in prison. Amir Hyuson declared that the Indian proletariat and the working masses are intensifying their struggle for India's true independence, for peace, and for friendship between India and the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries. Before the adjournment of the congress, the delegates stood up to pay tribute to the martyrs who sacrificed themselves in the struggle for the liberation of the Indian working class.

　　全印职工大会揭幕
  　苏捷波各国职工会纷致贺电
  　阿米阿逊报告罢工斗争事实
    【新华社北平三十一日电】塔斯社孟买讯：全印职工大会年会于二十八日在孟买举行。与会者有来自加尔各答、堪贝托尔、德里、孟买、孔波、绍拉浦及印度其他许多城市及工业区的代表七百余人。由于政府对全印职工大会的迫害，大会在紧张的政治气氛中举行：全印职工大会许多领袖此刻正被拘在监狱中：全印职工大会总书记甘狄在年会前夕被捕、警察当局对年会的工作加以极多的限制，只准代表们关起门来开会，没有邀请来宾和旁听者的权利，也不许组织孟买本地工人集会或示威。会议厅中张贴着标语，表明印度无产阶级当前的政治及经济要求：“我们要求将一切基本工业收归国有，没收外国资本，废除封建地主的土地所有制度”，“工人为稳定的生活工资而斗争，为工作权、罢工权和公民自由权而斗争”，“粉碎策划第三次世界大战的帝国主义者的阴谋”，“打倒北大西洋公约”，“和不列颠帝国继绝一切关系”，“保卫和平，反对战争贩子”。大会在热烈的掌声和一再高喊“苏联万岁”的声浪中，宣读着全苏职工会中央委员会的贺词。大会并宣读世界工联和意大利、法国、保加利亚、捷克斯洛伐克、波兰进步职工会的贺词。
    大会主席柴狄亚敦促印度一切工会会员及印度全体人民加紧进行保卫和平反对帝国主义战争挑拨者的斗争。柴狄亚强烈谴责印度政府根据所谓“公安维持法”对进步工会中央和地方机构的迫害。
    阿米阿逊代表全印职工大会组织委员会提出报告说：“在全印职工大会上届大会闭幕以来的过去两年中，印度工人一直在对印度资产阶级愈来愈凶的剥削进行坚决的激烈斗争，印度一切工业部门中的工人，都卷入了这个斗争。堪贝托尔四万纺织工人的三月罢工，那格浦尔三万工人的两月罢工，贝哈尔矿工的罢工，加尔各答电车工人和马德拉斯省运输工人的罢工，南德干、阿萨密和海德拉巴铁路工人的英勇罢工——这些都是印度全体无产阶级还都记得的罢工。”报告里详细地列举印度政府迫害印度进步职工会的许多事实。
    阿米阿逊宣称，印度工会运动、农民运动、学生运动和其他人民运动中的二万五千余名积极分子现在已被拘禁在监狱中。被拘禁的人里包括全印职工大会主席丹吉，副主席米拉卡和宇苏夫。印度工人阶级的领袖杜尔卡尼、巴拉特瓦吉、马立克沙海勃等已在狱中死去。阿米阿逊宣称，印度无产阶级和劳动人民群众正在为印度的真正独立，为和平，为印度与苏联及各人民民主国家的友谊而加紧斗争。在大会休会之前，代表们起立向那些在为印度工人阶级解放事业而斗争中牺牲的烈士们致敬。
