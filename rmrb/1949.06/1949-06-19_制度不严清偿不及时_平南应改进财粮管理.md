　　Lax Systems, Untimely Reimbursement
　　Pingnan Should Improve Financial and Grain Management
　　[Our Newspaper News] Our newspaper reporter Zhao Gang reports: During the support of the Pingjin Campaign in the Pingnan Special District of Central Hebei, the entire district's party, government, army and people worked actively and basically completed the supply task. However, due to lax management and untimely clearing and reimbursement, serious disorder in the financial and grain system and management was created, wasting financial resources and increasing the burden on the people. After the Pingjin Campaign, although the counties had begun financial and grain clearing, they only focused on clearing procedures and neglected the clearing of requisition, supply and reimbursement work, so that the advance requisition and borrowing of grain, firewood, etc. from the masses could not be cleared and returned in a timely manner. Furthermore, the grain funds allocated by the higher authorities to reimburse the masses were delayed at each level and not issued for a long time, causing the masses to suffer losses from rising prices. At the same time, many village cadres arbitrarily apportioned and even embezzled and wasted resources. Due to lax financial and grain management, according to statistics on the transport of grain and firewood during this campaign, the average loss was 25% to 30%, and in individual counties it even reached 50%. After discovering the above phenomenon, the Commissioner's Office immediately instructed the counties to quickly carry out clearing and reimbursement, investigate responsibility and handle the cases accordingly.

　　制度不严清偿不及时
  　平南应改进财粮管理
    【本报讯】本报记者赵刚报导：冀中平南专区在支援平津战役中，全区党政军民积极努力，基本上完成供给任务。但由于管理不严，清理和偿还不及时，造成了财粮制度和管理上的严重紊乱，浪费财力，加重人民负担。平津战役结束后，各县虽已着手财粮清理，但只着重清理手续，而忽视了征收取给和偿还工作的清理，使预征和预借群众的粮柴等未能及时清还。甚而将上级拨付偿还群众的粮款，逐级停留迟迟未发，致群众受到物价上涨的损失。同时不少村村干部随便摊派甚至贪污浪费。由于财粮管理不严，据此次战役中来往调运粮柴的统计，一般的都伤耗百分之二十五甚至百分之三十，个别县竟达百分之五十。发现上述现象后，专署已立即指示各县迅速进行清还，并追究责任分别处理。
