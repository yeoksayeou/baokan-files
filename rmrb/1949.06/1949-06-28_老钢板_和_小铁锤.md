　　“Old Steel Plate” and “Little Hammer”
    Ye Tao
    I.
    The lathe spun merrily. Old Steel Plate and Little Hammer were machining the hook on a car's steering knuckle. Shang Ming dashed into the Mechanical and Electrical Department, panting, and shouted, "Shanghai is completely liberated!".
    "Is it confirmed?" Little Hammer asked.
    "The extra has already been issued. Who would fool you with that?"
    "Shanghai is completely liberated!" Little Hammer, overjoyed, jumped up and down with Little Xi. Wang Hai and Li Quan, working on a newly delivered starter motor, were “doodling.” Old Steel Plate's mustache bristled with joy.
    "This time, the Kuomintang is really like a yellow weasel poking a fire; its paws are burnt dry!"
    "Now they only have the territory of a small area in the south left, like a toad urinating!"
    "If we add another burst of effort, we will completely defeat them!"
    "The front is winning battles, we in the rear must produce more to support them!"
    "We must produce more—produce quickly! I propose: In our Mechanical and Electrical Department, no one can be technically conservative anymore. This is not the era of Kuomintang rule. Keeping the technique locked in your stomach is not a good way to do things!” Before Wang Hai could finish, everyone's eyes were staring straight at Old Steel Plate, as if these words were aimed at him. Old Steel Plate knew in his heart that these words were indeed directed at him, so he immediately retorted, "Skills are learned. You also have brains, eyes, and hands; you can go and learn!"
    "How can learners learn if the teachers don't reveal the secrets?"
    "Wang Hai, who are you saying isn't teaching you!"
    "Master Ding, it's no one else but you!"
    "Let's be frank. Wang Hai, in what way have I wronged you? I've helped you with every job! Today, in front of everyone, you were circling around for a long time just to stab me!" Old Steel Plate rolled up his sleeves: "Then let's just make it clear!" Wang Hai, seeing this intensity, stepped forward: "What, you dare to resort to violence?"
    "Don't argue, don't argue! There's nothing so serious. Master Ding, let him be a dabbler! Wang Hai, don't say anymore. Today is a good day to celebrate the complete liberation of Shanghai; don't cause trouble!" Li Quan came up and smoothed things over halfway when Horseshoe came in and said, "Shanghai is completely liberated. The union is preparing to hold a celebration meeting and is also planning to discuss how to step up production to support the front lines. Please, each group leader, go to the meeting room immediately!"
    "Let's go! Master Ding, let's go to the meeting together!" Little Hammer pulled Old Steel Plate along to the meeting.

    II.
    As stubborn as dead elm, born with a bad temper, Old Steel Plate has been stubborn since he was a child. He is from Shandong, tall, burly, and dark, with a face full of stiff, connected whiskers, looking just like Zhou Cang in paintings, quite intimidating. In fact, he is a kind-hearted man, straightforward and generous. He would pawn and sell his pants for a friend, but there is one thing that isn't good, and that is his set of skills. Unless it is a close brother, he will not teach you. There is a reason for this:
    When he was twenty-six, he was an apprentice at the Anshan Iron Works in Northeast China. His master, Quick Hands Liu, was a famous lathe operator. When he first arrived at the factory, he couldn't work on the machines and did odd jobs every day: wiping lathes, washing lathes, drilling lathes, tightening screws, sweeping the floor, serving meals... After a year, he began to learn lathe work. After the "September 18th" Incident, Quick Hands Liu went to Dalian. A small-nosed Japanese technician came to the factory to work on the lathes. On his first day, the small-nosed guy didn't like him and transferred him to the forging department to hammer iron. After hammering for half a year, he was transferred back to the Mechanical and Electrical Department as an apprentice because of the small number of people there. However, the small-nosed guy only asked him to pass tools, wipe the lathes, and fetch water for washing his face and feet; he never taught him any techniques.
    "Chala La!" In a few minutes, the small-nosed guy machined a car nozzle (piston). Old Steel Plate, standing behind him, stared with his eyes, feeling strangely itchy in his heart. Once, twice, three times, ten times, twenty times, Old Steel Plate opened his mouth: "Mr. Toko Ichiro! I would like to learn how to machine nozzles from you. Could you teach me?" Unexpectedly, the small-nosed guy turned his butt around, turned his head, and with a "slap" smacked Old Steel Plate's head, knocking out two of his front teeth. Fresh blood flowed all over the ground. The small-nosed guy cursed fiercely: "Eight Ga Ya Deer, you're not worthy to learn this!"
    Since then, Old Steel Plate secretly watched how he machined the nozzles when he was handing things to the small-nosed guy: "He has two hands, and I have two hands. I don't believe I can't learn it!" Old Steel Plate carefully watched the nozzle, which was thicker than his thumb, turning under the lathe knife for a few turns. In a few minutes, the six grooves at the bottom of the nozzle were machined. Wipe, wipe... In another three minutes, the smooth grooves on the top layer of the nozzle appeared very clearly. "There's no trick to it?" However, it is more difficult to machine the copper pipe on the top of the nozzle. The pipe has two smooth grooves and one tooth groove. When the lathe knife rotates, if too much force is used, it is easy to break; if too little force is used, bumps easily appear on the groove. The force must be used correctly and appropriately. Looking at the small-nosed guy's smug appearance, with a cigarette in the corner of his mouth, spitting out a few smoke rings every time he machined a screw, Old Steel Plate felt unhappy in his heart, as if a papaya was stuffed in it: "Damn you! Small-nosed guy, I don't need you to teach me. One day I will learn!"
    Every night after work, Old Steel Plate secretly started the lathe and put the collected waste material on the lathe knife to learn how to machine nozzles. At first, he machined something that didn't look like anything. After a week, it was a little more like it. He could machine one groove out of the six grooves at the bottom of the nozzle, but this groove always had missing edges and holes, and no matter how he looked at it, it didn't look right. Only when the small-nosed guy was working during the day would he stand behind him and watch carefully. After watching for more than three months, Old Steel Plate's brain opened the lock: "Damn it! I didn't pay attention to the fact that he was still holding the edge of the groove with his thumb. No wonder the force was applied evenly, and the machined groove was smooth and good-looking." Then he started the lathe again and continued machining. He had not been machining for three minutes when he suddenly saw a figure outside the window. He was afraid it was the small-nosed guy, and he panicked in his heart. "Kaba!" With a sound, the index finger of his left hand was machined off by the lathe knife. At that time, blood gushed out like a spring. The figure outside the window also disappeared. "Damn who it is, I still have to do it!" After saying that, Old Steel Plate tore off a corner of his clothes to wrap his hand and continued machining. This time it was as easy as taking a key to open a lock, and he machined it all at once. That night, Old Steel Plate was so excited that he couldn't sleep: "I finally figured it out!"
    After the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, Old Steel Plate thought that the sky was clear and he could have a good life. Through a friend's introduction, he went to the Tangshan Ordnance Repair Shop to work as a technician. This ordnance repair shop belonged to the Kuomintang pseudo-suppression headquarters. He worked for three months without receiving a penny of wages. Looking at the smug appearance of the director of the ordnance repair shop, who sat in a small jeep every day, wearing shiny riding boots, walking back and forth, clicking, quite pretentious. Every time he gathered everyone for a "lecture," it was full of "improving everyone's life"! In fact, even cornbread was not available for the workers to eat. Everyone saw that they had to fight, so they publicly elected Old Steel Plate to demand wages. "We can't eat enough every day. If we don't get paid, we won't be able to work anymore..." Old Steel Plate walked into the "Director's Office" and said these few words. The old fat director angrily kicked Old Steel Plate in the stomach with his riding boot: "This is a military organization, this is a military factory. You want to take the lead in inciting a labor strike, you must be a 'communist bandit' sent here. Take him away!" Old Steel Plate was imprisoned for seven days before he was bailed out by the signatures of all the workers in the Mechanical and Electrical Department.
    Back in the dormitory, he found that his set of new tools, which he had bought from Anshan, had also been searched and taken away by the guard captain, Cai Baldy: "This is the saddle on the horse's body. Damn the Kuomintang, you are really ruthless to the extreme, eating people to death without spitting out bones!"
    Since then, he began to slack off at work. He, Little Hammer, and Little Xi were known as the "Three Lazy Men." Each of them took more than an hour to go to the toilet, and no one would reveal their skills to others.

    III.
    After the liberation of Tangshan, the Ordnance Repair Shop was changed to an Iron Factory. Instead of making guns and ammunition, it was converted to make agricultural tools, waterwheels,铡knives, and car springs, half-shafts...etc. Old Steel Plate was valued by the factory immediately because of his good skills and hardworking nature. In less than three months, he was promoted to first-grade technician. During the Red May Labor Competition, Old Steel Plate worked overtime for half a month in a row. Sometimes, after he finished his work, he would run to the forging department to help others make steel plates. Others would take twenty minutes to punch a hole, but he could punch it in ten minutes. He punched it both round and accurately, and he baked the curves quickly. Everyone admired his skills very much.
    Everything went smoothly and pleasantly, but there were two things that made him impatient: one was attending big lectures, and the other was attending meetings. He thought to himself: "I don't want to become a great scholar. It's good to work hard and earn a living with my skills. What's the use of learning classes?" It was more difficult for him to learn a word than to bend a steel plate. As for attending meetings, he had even more of a headache: "What's there to discuss? If you want to work, just work! One meeting lasts for several hours, and my arms and legs get stiff." Therefore, whenever there was a class or a meeting, he would always slip away under the pretense of "having work to do."
    The apprentices admired him, so they all asked him for advice in the machine room. He did teach them, but he didn't teach them in depth: "A thousand-year-old ditch flows into a river, and an abused daughter-in-law becomes a mother-in-law. I can't easily teach you all my skills!" Thinking of this, he recalled how his index finger had been machined off because he had secretly learned how to machine nozzles. "If you want to learn, you have to work hard!"
    Little Hammer often taught Old Steel Plate to read after work and often wrote letters for him. He had a deeper understanding of Old Steel Plate. Old Steel Plate loved Little Hammer for being smart, capable, and cultured, and also saw that he was very diligent, so he often liked to teach him techniques. He taught him everything, except for machining nozzles.
    Little Hammer saw that Old Steel Plate didn't teach him how to machine nozzles, so he asked Old Steel Plate how to machine nozzles whenever he had a chance. At first, Old Steel Plate also gave him a perfunctory start. Later, seeing that Little Hammer's questions became more and more pressing and he wanted to get to the bottom of things, he became a little scared: "Brother, don't ask, this thing is really hard to learn. You see, I lost this finger because I learned this thing!"
    Little Hammer knew that Old Steel Plate was unwilling to teach him, so he decided to stand behind Old Steel Plate and learn secretly while Old Steel Plate was machining nozzles.
    At first, Old Steel Plate didn't feel that Little Hammer was standing behind him, just like he used to learn secretly himself. Later, after it happened many times, he became uneasy: "Little Hammer, you also have work, why don't you do it? Why do you just watch me work here!" Little Hammer had no choice but to return to his original position. In this way, Old Steel Plate's guarded and planned prevention of him learning made Little Hammer's progress very slow, and at the same time, he felt that learning this thing was very difficult. However, strong will is the weapon to overcome everything. Little Hammer took time every day to be careful and watch secretly, little by little. In less than two months, except for the copper pipe on the nozzle that he couldn't machine well, he had learned to machine all the other parts of the nozzle. He was very happy in his heart and thought: "After I learn it well, I will definitely teach it to all the brothers in the Mechanical and Electrical Department!"
    Who knew that his plan had not yet been realized when, unfortunately, Old Steel Plate got a little cold on the night of the "complete liberation of Shanghai" and became ill, and he didn't come to work for more than a week.

    IV.
    Little Hammer would run to Old Steel Plate's dormitory after work or after class to make tea for him, fetch water, light his cigarettes, cook noodles, sweep the floor, and empty his chamber pot. On the afternoon of the 18th, Director Li of the union and several apprentices from the Mechanical and Electrical Department bought twelve sweet pears to give to Old Steel Plate to eat. They sat for more than half an hour and then went back to work. Old Steel Plate wanted to eat a pear, and Little Hammer quickly took out a small knife, peeled one, and handed it to him. Old Steel Plate sat up, and his eyes filled with tears as he ate: "Little Hammer, you are really too good to me! You are even better than my own brother! It's just that I am too bad. I'm really sorry for you!" Little Hammer quickly wiped his tears with his handkerchief: "Master Ding, don't be sad. You are sick, shouldn't I take care of you? What have you done to be sorry for me? Master Ding, you are too narrow-minded!" The more Little Hammer tried to persuade him, the sadder Old Steel Plate became, and in the end, he cried out loudly.
    "After I got sick, what classes have we learned these days? Tell me about them!" Little Hammer repeatedly said, "Okay, okay!" He quickly wrung out a hot towel for him and began to say: "Recently, Comrade Wang gave us a brief history of social development. He said that in ancient Rome, the rulers, in order to deceive the people and increase their exploitation, raised many lawyers, who were legs that spread rumors and lies. They coaxed the people, saying that God said that society was like a human body, with the rich being the stomach and the poor being the two hands. The hands should find food for the stomach, and the stomach was born for digestion and enjoyment, and should not labor!"
    "Is there such a thing? Bullshit!"
    "Yes! There is no such thing at all! This is a lie told by lawyers."
    "Little Hammer, tell me what else was said?"
    "In the Russian serf era, on the first night of a serf's marriage, the wife should be given to the landlord to sleep with!"
    "Really?" Old Steel Plate asked with wide eyes.
    "The book says so, can it be false?"
    "This is really—shitting on their necks, bullying people too much! What else did they say? Little Hammer, tell me more!"
    "Comrade Zhang came yesterday and gave us a talk on new labor attitudes and new technical understanding."
    "What's that all about?"
    "He said: Before liberation, the Kuomintang didn't treat us workers as human beings at all, completely using us as machines. We workers had no right to speak, let alone be masters. But after liberation, we workers became masters! Not only can we speak, but we can also manage our own factories!"
    "That's right! We couldn't speak in the past. That time I went to see the old fatty, he kicked me and imprisoned me for seven days!"
    "Yes! So he said that because we workers are masters and working for ourselves, everyone is working hard and no longer slacking off. Everyone is using as much strength as they have. This kind of actively working is a new labor attitude." He also said: "In the past, many workers had things in their stomachs, but they didn't want to reveal them because they hated the Kuomintang's oppression and exploitation. Now that we are liberated, we should all reveal them and teach them to everyone, so that everyone can learn, research, invent, and create better things to support the front lines in fighting old Chiang. This is called a new technical understanding! Anyone who has something and doesn't reveal it is conservative, selfish, self-serving, and violates the interests of the masses!"
    "Little Hammer!" Old Steel Plate jumped out of bed and shook his hand: "Today, you have completely opened the lock on my brain. I hate myself for not studying hard in culture classes in the past, for not attending meetings properly, which led to my conservative old ideas and selfishness! I am such a backward person!"
    "Master Ding! As long as you study hard from now on and accept everyone's criticism and opinions, you will never be backward!" Then Little Hammer told Old Steel Plate about secretly learning how to machine nozzles.
    "I used to secretly learn from the small-nosed guy like you, but I didn't expect you to learn from me today. However, that was the Japanese era, and now it is the People's Government era. I really shouldn't have done that! Have you learned it all?"
    "I've learned everything except for that copper pipe!"
    "Let's go! Let's go to the Mechanical and Electrical Department!"
    "What for? You're not well yet!"
    "I'm well! I want to teach you, and I want to teach all the brothers in our Mechanical and Electrical Department! And I want to launch a production competition with everyone!"

　　“老钢板”和“小铁锤”
    叶淘
    一
    车床滴溜溜地在转动，老钢板和小铁锤正在旋汽车方向接头上的挂钩，尚明一脚跑进机电部，喘着气，大声的说：“上海完全解放！”。
    “证实了吗？”小铁锤问。
    “号外都出啦，谁还哄你？”
    “上海完全解放！”小铁锤高兴得和小喜抱着跳了起来，王海和李泉拉着新运来的起动机“打嘟噜”，老钢板的胡子喜得都翘了起来：
    “这一回国民党可真是黄狼子烤火，烧干了爪子啦！”
    “现在他们只剩下癞蛤蟆撒尿，一小片南方地盘了！”
    “再加一把劲，就会完全把他们打垮！”
    “前方打胜仗，咱后方要多生产支援！”
    “要多生产—快生产！我提议：在咱们机电部里，谁也不能再保守技术，这不是国民党统治的时代了，有技术放在自己的肚里，不向外掏！”王海话还没有说完，大伙的眼睛珠子，都直直地瞅着老钢板，好象这话是冲着老钢板说的。老钢板自己心里也知道这话是冲着他的，于是开口就顶他一句：“本事是学来的，你也有脑子、有眼睛、有手，你可以去学！”
    “教的人不掏出来，学的人怎学？”
    “王海你说谁不教你！”
    “丁师傅，没有别人就是你！”
    “打开窗户说亮话，王海，我那点对不起你？做啥活我没有帮你的忙！今天你在大伙前，绕着脖子转了半天圈子原来是刺我！”老钢板一卷袖子：“那咱们就干脆说明白吧！”王海见这劲头迎上前去：“怎么你还敢动武？”
    “别吵别吵！有什么大不了的事，丁师傅你让他是个半吊子！王海你别再说啦，今天咱们是庆祝上海完全解放的好日子，可不许生闲气呀！”李泉走上来刚把场子圆了半个，马蹄铁走进来说：“上海完全解放，职工会预备开一个庆祝会，还计划讨论今后怎样加紧生产支援前线，请各小组长马上就到会议室去！”
    “走吧！丁师傅开会去！”小铁锤就势拉出老钢板一块开会去了。
    二
    死榆木头不通电，生来就是这么一个蹩家伙，老钢板从小脾气就倔，他是山东人，大高粗黑黑的个子，长了一脸硬刺刺的连边胡子，看样子真象画上的周仓，怪吓人的。其实他却是个好心肠人，直爽、慷慨，为朋友可以押挡、卖裤子，可是，只有一样不好，就是他的一套本领，除非是亲兄弟，不然，他不会教你，这其中是有个原因的：
    他二十六岁时在东北鞍山铁工厂当学徒，师傅叫快手刘是有名的旋工，他刚到厂时，还不能上机器，天天干杂活，擦车床子，洗车床子，钻车床子，松紧螺丝，扫地，端饭，……一年以后，才开始学旋活。“九一八”事变后，快手刘到大连去了，厂子里来了一个小鼻子日本技工，搞旋床子。头一天来，小鼻子就看他不顺眼，就把他调到锻工部去打铁，打了半年，又因机电部人少，小鼻子又把他调回来当学待。但是，小鼻子光叫他递递工具，擦床子，打洗脸洗脚水，他从来不教他技术。
    “喳啦啦！”几分钟，小鼻子就旋好了一个汽车嘴子（活塞）。站在后面的老钢板两只眼睛直溜溜地瞅着，心里头怪痒痒的，一次、两次、三次、十次、二十次，老钢板开了口：“德可一郎先生！我想跟你学学旋嘴子，你能不能教教我？”没有提防小鼻子调过屁股回过头来，就“拍”的一板头，把老钢板的门牙打掉了两个，鲜血流满了一地，小鼻子狠狠地骂：“八个牙鹿，你还配学这个！”
    自那以后，老钢板就在给小鼻子递东西时，偷偷地看他咋样旋嘴子：“他也有两只手，我也有两只手，我不相信学不会！”老钢板细心的看着那个比大姆指还粗的嘴子，在旋刀下转了几圈，几分钟吧，嘴子最底下的六道沟就旋出来。擦擦擦………又有三分钟吧，嘴子最上层的光沟，就很清楚的出现了。“这也没有什么巧门？”不过在旋嘴子上头的铜管时是比较困难的，管子是两道光沟，一道牙齿，当旋刀转动时，用的劲过大了，容易旋断，用的劲小了，沟上容易起疙瘩，劲一定要用对，用得合适。瞅小鼻子那个洋洋自得，嘴角衔上一颗纸烟，每旋好个螺丝吐几口烟圈那个熊样子，老钢板心里就象塞上个木瓜似的不高兴：“操你奶奶！小鼻子，老子不用你教，总有一天老子会学会！”
    每天晚上下了工，老钢板就偷偷的开动旋床子，把集来的废料，放在旋刀上学旋嘴子。起初旋得是四不象，一个星期过去，有点谱了，嘴子底下的六道沟，能旋出一道沟了，但这一道沟总是缺边漏孔的，自己咋看咋也不对头。只有白天小鼻子工作时，站在他后面仔细看，一连看了三个多月，老钢板脑瓜子打开了锁：“他妈的！我就没注意他那个大姆指还扣住沟边，怪不得劲用的均匀，旋出来平滑好看。”接着他又开动着床子继续旋，刚旋不到三分钟，忽然看见窗外有个人影，他怕是小鼻子，心里一慌，“咔巴！”一声，左手食指头被旋刀旋去了，当时血象泉水一样的涌了出来，窗外的人影也不见了。“管他妈是谁，老子还要干！”说完老钢板撕下一块衣角把手包好，又继续旋下去，这一回就象拿着钥匙去开锁那样容易，一下子就旋好了，当夜，老钢板兴奋得没睡着觉：“总叫我摸会了！”
    抗战胜利后，老钢板满以为天晴了，可以过好日子了，由朋友介绍到唐山修械所搞技工，这个修械所是国民党伪剿总的。干活三月，没有拿到一文工资，瞅瞅修械所主任那个熊样子天天坐小吉普，穿着雪亮的马靴，咔咔咔的走来走去，怪神气的，一召集大伙“训话”就是满口的“改善大家生活”！实际上连窝窝头工人们也吃不上了，大家也都看破了非得斗争不可，就公推老钢板去要求发工资。“天天吃不饱肚子，再不发工资，我们就再也干不了活……”老钢板走进“主任室”开口说了这么几句。老胖子主任就怒冲冲的朝着老钢板肚子就是一马靴：“这是军事机关这是军工厂，你想带头煽动工潮，想必是‘奸匪’派过来的，给我押起来！”老钢板被押了七天禁闭，后来由机电部全体工友签名具保才保了出来。
    回到宿舍里，他发现自己从鞍山买来的一套新工具也被警卫队长蔡秃子搜跑了：“这是马身上的鞍子，他妈的国民党你们真狠到家了，吃死人不吐骨头！”
    自那之后，他就开始磨起洋工来了，和小铁锤、小喜，称为“三大懒人”，每人上一趟毛厕也得一点多钟，谁有本领也不向外掏。
    三
    唐山解放后，修械所改为铁工厂，不造枪械，改造农具、水车、铡刀及汽车钢板，半截轴……等东西，老钢板因为技术好，干活又卖劲，马上就受到厂方重视，不到三月就被提升为一级技工。在红五月立功竞赛时，老钢板一连加班半拉月，有时，他自己干完活，就跑到煆工部去帮助别人打造钢板。别人冲眼得二十分钟，他十分钟就冲好了，冲的又鼓又正确，烤弯他烤的也快，大伙非常佩服他的技术。
    做啥事都顺心顺气，只是有两样使他不耐烦，一样是上大课，一样是开会。他心里这样想：“我又不想成大学问家，好好干活，凭技术吃饭就是啦，学什么课？”他学一个字，比烤弯还费劲；至于开会他更是头痛：“有啥讨论？要干就干就是啦！一开开几个钟头，胳膊腿都坐硬了。”因此，一上课，或者一开会，他总是借着“有工作”就滑过去了。
    学徒们因为都佩服他，所以在机器房里，都向他请教。他呢？也教，不过不向深处教：“千年的水沟流成河，受气的媳妇熬成婆，我可不能轻易的把本事都教给你们！”想到这，他又忆起自己的食指因为偷学旋嘴子被旋掉了。“要学你们也得下功夫呀！”
    小铁锤，在下了班时，时常教老钢板认字，又时常代他写信，对老钢板认识比较深一点。老钢板爱小铁锤聪明、能干、有文化，又看他很勤谨，所以就常爱教他技术。只是有一样什么都教，就是旋嘴子这样不教。
    小铁锤看出来老钢板不教他旋嘴子，于是一抽空就问老钢板嘴子咋旋？起初老钢板也敷衍式的给他讲个起头，后来看小铁锤越问越紧要打破沙缸问到底，心里有点害怕了：“老弟，别问了，这玩艺儿可真不好学，你看我因为学这玩艺，这只手指头都旋跑了！”
    小铁锤知道老钢板不愿教他，就决定在老钢板旋嘴子时，站在他身后偷着学。
    起初，老钢板是没有感觉到小铁锤站在他身后象他自己过去偷着学，后来次数多了，他心里不安起来了：“小铁锤你也有活，咋不去做？光在这看我干活！”小铁锤没办法只得又回到自己的原来位置，这样老钢板的有防备、有计划的阻止他学，使小铁锤的进步很慢，同时感到学这玩艺很难。可是，坚强的意志是战胜一切的武器，小铁锤天天抽空细心，一星一点的偷着看，不到两个月，除了嘴子上的铜管子自己旋不好外，嘴子的其他各部，他都学会旋了，他心里很高兴核计着：“我学好了，一定教给全机电部的兄弟们！”
    谁知道他这个计划还没有实现，不巧，老钢板就在“上海完全解放”的那天晚上因为受了点凉，就病了，一病病了一个星期多，没有来上工。
    四
    小铁锤一下了工，或者下了课，就跑到老钢板宿舍去，给他弄茶弄水、点纸烟、煮挂面、扫地、倒尿罐子。十八号那天下午，职工会李主任和机电部几个学徒买了十二个甜梨送给老钢板吃，他们坐了半点多钟就回去工作了。老钢板想吃梨，小铁锤赶快掏出小刀，削了一个，顺手递给他吃，老钢板坐了起来，一边吃一边两眼眶子上装满了泪：“小铁锤，你对我真太好了！比我亲兄弟还好！只是我这个人太不好了，我真对不起你！”小铁锤赶快用手帕给他擦了眼泪：“丁师傅别难过，你有病，我不该侍候你吗？你有啥对不起我？丁师傅你真太小心眼了！”小铁锤越劝，老钢板越难过，到最后就大声的“喂喂”的哭了。
    “我病了后，这几天咱们学了些啥课？你给我讲讲！”小铁锤连说：“好，好！”赶快给他拧了一把热手巾，就开口说：“最近王同志给咱们讲了一点社会发展简史，他说从前在罗马，统治者为了欺骗人民，加重剥削人民，养了很多辩护士，就是造谣说谎的腿子，他们哄人民说上帝说社会好比人身，有钱的人是胃，穷人是两只手，手应该去为胃找食，胃生来就是为消化用的，享受用的，不该劳动！”
    “那有这事？放屁！”
    “是呀！根本没有这事！这是辩护士撒谎。”
    “小铁锤你再说还讲啥？”
    “俄国农奴时代，农奴结婚第一天夜里，媳妇应该让给地主困！”
    “真的吗？”老钢板瞪大眼珠子问。
    “书上说的，还能有假？”
    “这真是—骑着脖子拉尿，欺人太甚！还讲了啥？小铁锤再给我讲！”
    “张同志昨天来了给我们讲了一篇新的劳动态度，和新的技术认识。”
    “是怎样一回事？”
    “他说：没有解放前，国民党根本没有拿咱们工人当人看待，完全当机器使用，没有咱们工人说话的权利，更谈不到当家了。可是解放后，咱们工人当了主人啦，不仅能说话，而且还能管理自己的工厂！”
    “对呀！过去咱们那能说话，我那一次去见老胖子还踢我一马靴，关了七天禁闭呢！”
    “是呀！所以他说因为咱们工人当了主人，自己给自己干活，所以大伙儿都卖力气，不再磨洋工，谁有多少力气使多少，这种自己主动地去干活，便是新的劳动态度。”他又说：“过去有很多工人自己肚里有东西，因为恨国民党压迫剥削，所以不愿掏出来，现在解放了，都掏出来，教给大伙；使大家都去学会，研究发明创造出更好的东西，去支援前线打老蒋，这就叫新的技术认识！谁要有东西再不掏出来，就是保守、自私、自利、违背群众的利益！”
    “小铁锤！”老钢板跳下床来握着他的手：“今天我的脑瓜子的锁，叫你全打开了，我恨自己过去为啥不好好上文化课，为啥不好好去开会，以致于自己保守老脑筋，自私！我就是这么一个落伍的人！”
    “丁师傅！只要你从今后好好学习，多接受大伙的批评与意见，是决不会落伍的！”接着小铁锤又向老钢板说了偷学旋嘴子的事。
    “我过去也象你一样向小鼻子偷学，不料今天你也学我。不过，那时是日本人时代，现在是人民政府时代了，我真不应该！你都学会了吧？”
    “除了那个铜管子没学会，其他的都学会了！”
    “走！咱们到机电部去！”
    “干什么？你的病还没好！”
    “病好了！我要把你教会，还要把咱们全机电部的兄弟们教会！并且和大家一起发动生产竞赛！”
