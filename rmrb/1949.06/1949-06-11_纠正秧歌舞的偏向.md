Correcting Deviations in Yangko Dance
　　Sha Jun · Li Cao

Since the liberation of Peiping, Yangko, a mass folk art, has quickly become widespread and developed in all social strata. Whenever celebrating the liberation of a major city or the arrival of their own festivals, people's Yangko teams would twist onto the streets from all directions. The rhythmic and exciting sounds of gongs and drums of the Yangko resounded everywhere, fully expressing the joy of the people in the liberated areas today.

However, apart from a few performing arts groups that can correctly grasp the ideological and artistic nature of Yangko, most of the amateur and under-educated Yangko teams have developed some deviations in terms of makeup and performance techniques (such as twisting and stepping): in the streets and alleys, we often see individually formed Yangko teams dressing themselves up in heavy makeup and glamorous clothes, smearing their faces with lead powder and rouge, and tying "stilts" on their legs, deliberately and even exaggeratedly making some nauseating, flirtatious movements to win the low-level cheers of the audience as satisfaction. This cannot but remind us of the "stilt parades," "dragon lantern parades," and "lion dances" that we used to see during the New Year and temple fairs.

Since Yangko is a mass art, it is essentially defined as a native "from the masses, to the masses" folk art form with incomparably rich content and mass character. Because of this, it is not only universal but also diverse in form. It gives people a feeling of simplicity, strength, naturalness, liveliness, and enthusiasm. However, today, in some "Yangko teams" in Peiping after liberation, which lack ideological leadership and necessary technical training, twist and turn to make people laugh in form in order to cater to the vulgar tastes of the general petty bourgeoisie. If this deviation is not quickly corrected, it will hinder the development of Yangko.

The main reasons for the emergence of this deviation are: on the one hand, the urban petty bourgeoisie is unfamiliar with rural life and production labor, and cannot correctly apply this lively and simple Yangko dance form; on the other hand, there is insufficient ideological guidance for them, and there is a lack of planned and step-by-step organization to strengthen necessary education in their work. In order to correct this deviation in a timely manner, we should first enlighten the masses' awareness and start to improve on the basis of their needs and willingness so as not to alienate the masses. In addition, it may be helpful to first identify several key points, cultivate backbone members and typical Yangko teams, and gradually improve them. Break through one point and use it to promote the overall situation, and carry out possible in-depth publicity, explanation, and education for them, so that the general amateur Yangko teams can obtain a correct understanding, and thereby master powerful, simple, and healthy performance methods (such as steps, formation arrangement, interspersing, and twisting). Only in this way can the masses' Yangko dance gradually expand its activities more widely, without falling into stagnation, and continue to be consolidated and improved. Otherwise, on the one hand, we will close the door and talk empty words about improvement, and on the other hand, we will increasingly degenerate into vulgarization that caters to the low-level tastes of the petty bourgeoisie, which will affect the normal development of Yangko!

　　纠正秧歌舞的偏向
    沙均·犁草
    北平解放以后，秧歌这一带有群众性的民间艺术，便很快地普遍和发展到各社会阶层中去。每当庆祝某一大城市的解放或自己节日的来到，人民的秧歌队，就从四面八方一起扭上了街。到处响起秧歌有节奏而又激动的锣鼓声，充分表现了今天解放区人民的欢乐。
    但在其中除了少数文工团能够正确地掌握秧歌的思想性与艺术性之外，更多的是业余性质的缺乏教育的秧歌队，却在化装和表现技术（如扭法、步法等）方面发生了一些偏向：在大街小巷，我们常不时地看到有些个别组成的秧歌队，把自己打扮成浓装艳服，脸上抹满了铅粉和胭脂，在腿上绑好“高跷”，扭起来故意甚至夸张地作出一些令人肉麻的，相互调情的动作以博得观众低级的喝采为满足。这使我们不能不联想到从前在过新年、赶庙会，所见到的那种“高跷会”“龙灯会”及“狮子会”一类的玩艺儿。
    秧歌既是群众性的一种艺术，就又本质地规定了它是一种土生土长“从群众中来到群众中去”的带有无比丰富的内容与群众性的民间艺术形式。正因为如此，就不但带有普遍性，而且形式是多样的。叫人看了，有一种淳朴、有力、自然、活泼和热辣辣的感觉。然而今天在解放后的北平某些缺乏思想领导和必要的技术训练的“秧歌队”，为迎合一般小市民庸俗的趣味，扭扭捏捏从形式上引人发笑，这种偏向如不迅速纠正，它就会阻碍了秧歌的发展。
    这种偏向的产生，它的主要原因：一方面城市小市民对农村生活及生产劳动是陌生的，对于这种活泼、朴素的秧歌舞形式不能正确地应用；另一方面是对他们思想上的启导不够，缺乏在工作中有计划、有步骤地把他们组织起来加强必要的教育。为要及时纠正这种偏向，首先应该启发群众的觉悟，在他们需要与自愿的基础上开始加以改进才不致于脱离群众。此外还不妨先找出几个重点，培养骨干分子及典型的秧歌队，逐步予以提高。突破一点而用以推动全面，并向他们作可能深入的宣传、解释和教育，使一般带有业余性质的秧歌队从而获得正确的理解，也从而得以掌握有力、朴素和健康的表现方法（如步伐、队形的排列、穿插与扭法等）。只有这样才能使群众的秧歌舞逐渐更广泛展开活动，不致陷于停滞，而能继续获得巩固与提高。不然一方面是关起门来空言提高，一方面是日益堕落为迎合小市民低级趣味的庸俗化，这样将会影响秧歌的正常发展！（完）
