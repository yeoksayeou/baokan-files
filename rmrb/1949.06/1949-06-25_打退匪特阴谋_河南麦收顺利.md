Xinhua News Agency, Kaifeng, June 24th: Henan Province has successfully completed its wheat harvest. This is another great victory for the people of Henan in their struggle against the remnant Kuomintang bandits and spies within the province. Since May, as the wheat gradually ripened, the Kuomintang remnants who roamed Henan spread rumors everywhere in an attempt to sabotage the wheat harvest. In some areas, instigated by special agents, incidents of robbing and stealing wheat occurred. In order to effectively protect the wheat harvest and defeat the conspiracies of bandits and spies, the Henan Provincial People's Government and the military region jointly issued a public notice in mid-May, detailing measures for protecting and harvesting wheat. As a result, farmers everywhere put forward the slogan of "Resolutely defend the grain at our doorstep," organized armed guard teams and wheat protection teams, and took turns on sentry duty and patrols. In areas of western Henan such as Jia County, Baofeng, and Xuchang, where anti-despot or rent reduction campaigns had taken place, militias implemented joint defense, and some villages even democratically discussed and formulated wheat protection agreements. This mass wheat protection movement, combined with the active suppression of bandits and spies by local armed forces, finally ensured the smooth completion of this wheat harvest. During the wheat harvest, local people's governments and the People's Liberation Army did their best to help with the harvesting. A certain unit of the Fourth Field Army, marching south, disregarded the fatigue of their long march and helped local residents harvest 8,975 mu of wheat in two days.

Another dispatch: Since late last month, locust nymphs have been discovered successively in Yanling, Xihua, Wuyang, and Minquan counties in Henan. Local people's governments are organizing farmers to actively eliminate them.

    打退匪特阴谋
    河南麦收顺利
    【新华社开封二十四日电】河南省麦收已顺利完成。这是河南人民与境内残存的国民党散匪进行斗争的又一次大胜利。五月以来，小麦渐熟，流窜河南境内的国民党残匪即到处散布谣言，企图破坏麦收。某些地区在特务分子的煽动下曾发生抢麦偷麦事件。河南省人民政府及军区为切实保卫麦收，打退匪特阴谋，即于五月中旬发出联合布告详细规定了护麦收麦办法。于是各地农民纷纷提出“坚决保卫口边粮”的口号，组织武装看护队、护麦队，轮流放哨巡查。在豫西郏县、宝丰、许昌等经过了反恶霸或减租的地区，民兵实行联防，有些村庄并经民主讨论订出护麦公约。这一群众性的护麦运动，和地方武装对匪特的积极清剿相配合，终于保证了此次麦收顺利完成。在麦收期间，各地人民政府，解放军都尽力帮助收割。南下的第四野战军某部不顾长途行军的疲劳，曾在两天内帮助驻地居民收麦八千九百七十五亩。
    【又电】河南鄢陵、西华、舞阳、民权等县自上月下旬以来，先后发现蝗蝻，当地人民政府正组织农民积极扑灭中。
