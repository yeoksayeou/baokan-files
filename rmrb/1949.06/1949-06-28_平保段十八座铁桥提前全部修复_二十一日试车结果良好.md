　　【Hebei Central Electricity】All eighteen iron bridges, both large and small, on the Pingbao section of the Pinghan Railway, including those at Beihe and Caohe, have been successfully repaired through the efforts of workers over two months. The bridge repair work commenced on April 15th, originally scheduled for completion on July 10th, but due to the extraordinary efforts of the workers who overcame various difficulties, it was completed ahead of schedule on June 20th. The Beihe Bridge, Caohe Bridge, and bridges 113, 118, and 119, among others, simultaneously underwent successful trial runs on the 21st of this month, with good results, and have begun to use the main line. During the construction of the Beihe Iron Bridge, the workers highly demonstrated their initiative and ingenuity. When moving the old bridge girders back to the factory for repair, lacking a crane, Chief Engineer Meng Xianzhang of the Road Construction Office led the way in creating the "Upright Man Pickaxe" and "Turntable" to replace the crane, moving the girders step by step onto the vehicles and sending them to the repair factory. When repairing the bridge piers, due to the absence of water pumps to drain the rapidly flowing river water, the workers used burlap sacks filled with sand and soil to encircle the pit, and then bailed the water outward. In twenty-six days, in addition to cleaning the old piers, 2,746 cubic meters were recast. During the installation of the bridge beams and the laying of the bridge deck, the workers spontaneously launched a competition. The transportation team proposed to the road construction team: we will deliver as many spans as you can install in a day; the road construction team even neglected their lunch, installing two spans in a day, exceeding the previous rate by two times. In the past, it would have taken six months to repair twenty-nine spans, a total of 407 meters long, six meters high, and capable of carrying 164-ton locomotives at 60 kilometers per hour (the highest speed on the Pinghan Railway). This major bridge project was completed in just over two months.

　　平保段十八座铁桥提前全部修复
  　二十一日试车结果良好
    【冀中电】平汉路平保段北河、漕河等处十八座大小铁桥，经工人两个多月的努力，已全部胜利修复。修桥工作自四月十五日开工，原定至七月十日完成，但因工人格外努力，克服了各种困难，提前于六月二十日完成。北河大桥、漕河桥及一一三、一一八、一一九等五座桥，于本月二十一日同时试车成功，情况良好，并开始改行正线。在修筑北河铁桥时，工人们曾高度发挥了他们的积极性与智慧。搬旧桥大梁回厂修理时，没有吊车，即由筑路处孟宪章主任领导，创造了代替吊车的“立人镐”和“转盘”，一步步的移到车上，送到修理厂。修桥墩时，因无抽水机吸走急流的河水，工人们便用麻袋装上沙土围在坑圈上，再向外淘水。二十六天除清理旧墩外，重铸二千七百四十六立方米。在按装桥梁与铺设桥面时，工人们自动掀起竞赛，运输队向筑路队提出：你们一天能按几孔我们就送几孔；筑路队连中饭也顾不得吃，一天按上两孔，超过往日两倍。过去六个月才能修好二十九孔，四百零七米长六米高，载重一百六十四吨的机车，每小时行进六十公里（平汉最高速度）的大桥梁，仅两个多月就完成了。
