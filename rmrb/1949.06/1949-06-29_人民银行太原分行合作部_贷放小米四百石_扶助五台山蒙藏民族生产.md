　　People's Bank of China Taiyuan Branch Cooperative Department
　　Loans 400 Shi of Millet
　　Supports Production of Mongolian and Tibetan Nationalities in Wutai Mountain
　　[Taiyuan Electric] The Cooperative Department of the Taiyuan Branch of the People's Bank of China is providing loans to support the production of Mongolian and Tibetan minorities in Wutai Mountain. Wutai Mountain is one of China's famous scenic spots, and historically some Mongolian and Tibetan lamas have resided there. After the liberation of Tianjin and Beijing, more than 80 people returned, and now there are a total of 428 Mongolian and Tibetan minorities. Among them, more than 180 people have no labor force. In addition, Wutai Mountain lacks land (each person averages only two fen of land), and during the Anti-Japanese War, due to enemy destruction, their lives were relatively difficult. Last year, the North China Government allocated 160 shi of millet and 60 bolts of foreign cloth for relief. The Beiyue Branch also provided loans to support their production, established the Mongolian-Tibetan-Han Medicine Production Cooperative, and organized them to dig medicinal materials. Last year, they dug more than 50,000 jin of various medicinal materials and led nearby residents to dig more than 70,000 jin of medicinal materials, solving the livelihood difficulties of the Mongolian, Tibetan, and Han masses in the area. After Wutai was assigned to the Taiyuan area, this loan was withdrawn accordingly. In order to continue to support the production of Mongolian and Tibetan minorities, the Cooperative Department of the Taiyuan Branch lent the Mongolian-Tibetan-Han Medicine Cooperative another 400 shi of millet on the 23rd of this month to organize Mongolian minorities to dig medicinal materials, raise pigs, and raise bees, so that their livelihood difficulties will be further resolved.

　　人民银行太原分行合作部
  　贷放小米四百石
  　扶助五台山蒙藏民族生产
    【太原电】中国人民银行太原分行合作部，贷款扶植五台山蒙藏少数民族进行生产。五台山为我国著名胜地之一，历代有一部蒙藏喇嘛居此，平津解放后又回来了八十余人，现在共有蒙藏少数民族四百二十八人。其中有一百八十余人无劳力，再加以五台山土地缺少（每人只平均二分地），抗战时期由于敌人的摧残，致使他们生活比较困难。去年华北政府曾拨出小米一百六十石，洋布六十匹进行救济。北岳分行并贷款扶植他们生产，成立了蒙藏汉医药生产社，组织他们刨药材，去年共刨了各种药材五万余斤、并带动附近居民刨药材七万余斤，解决了该地蒙藏汉群众的生活困难。五台划归太原区后，此项贷款随之收回，为了继续扶植蒙藏少数民族进行生产，太原分行合作部，又于本月二十三日贷给蒙藏汉医药合作社小米四百石，组织蒙藏少数民族刨药材、喂猪、养蜂等，使他们的生活困难得到进一步的解决。
