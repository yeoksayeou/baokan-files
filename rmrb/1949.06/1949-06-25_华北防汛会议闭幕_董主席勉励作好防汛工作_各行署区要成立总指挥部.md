    North China Flood Prevention Conference Concludes
    Chairman Dong Encourages Flood Prevention Work
    Each Administrative Office Region to Establish a General Headquarters
    [This newspaper reports] The first North China Flood Prevention Conference, which opened on June 16th, concluded successfully on the 24th after seven days of reports and discussions. More than 40 representatives and guests from various regions attended yesterday's closing session. Dong Biwu, Chairman of the North China People's Government, also attended and delivered a speech. Chairman Dong said: Water conservancy work is a major undertaking for the entire North China region, and it has a decisive significance for agricultural production in certain areas of North China. Rivers crisscross throughout North China, but most of them cause more harm than benefit to the people, and the people can utilize them less. This is because artificial measures have not been implemented, or although processing has been carried out, it has been in disrepair for many years, and due to the destruction by counter-revolutionaries during the long-term war. Therefore, generally speaking, the people feel that rivers are more harmful than beneficial to them. Under the current circumstances where financial, human, and material resources are not sufficient, water conservancy work can only be done as a passive flood prevention work, and it is impossible to engage in major fundamental projects. However, as long as we can truly do a good job in flood prevention work and prevent major disasters, this is a great achievement. This year, North China is completely liberated, and all rivers are under the control of the people. Our old water conservancy workers can work with peace of mind on river management and flood prevention, which is very different from the past when we fought against the enemy on one side and against the water on the other. Regarding this year's flood prevention, Chairman Dong instructed the newly participating water conservancy workers to recognize that engaging in water conservancy work in the future means serving the people, which is fundamentally different from before. Chairman Dong used several vivid examples to illustrate that in a class society, everyone serves a certain class. In the past, under the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang, some enthusiastic scientists were willing to contribute their strength, thinking that they were serving the people. Perhaps the people got some benefits, but who took the main benefits? Who did it mainly help? Wasn't it the landlords, bureaucrats, and monopoly capitalists who took the main fruits? Today, comrades who have newly joined the work have the opportunity to dedicate themselves to the society of New Democracy, which means that this year's flood prevention is fundamentally different from the past for the comrades who have newly joined the work. Chairman Dong continued to point out that under the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang, it was easy to turn a business organization into a bureaucratic organization. Although we have broken the old bureaucratic organizations today, bureaucracy is not easy to be eliminated in a society where small-scale production still dominates. We must be vigilant and strive to avoid delays, mistakes, perfunctory behavior, and detachment from the masses in water conservancy work, and constantly fight against bureaucracy. Finally, Chairman Dong, with encouraging words, hoped that the comrades from various places attending this meeting would summarize the past experience in flood prevention, arrange future work, and make this year's flood prevention work better than in previous years.
    Summary of Comrade Hao Zhizhai's Report
    In the afternoon, Comrade Hao Zhizhai, member of the North China Water Conservancy Committee, made a summary report, the main points of which are:
    1. Understanding of this year's flood prevention: Now that North China has been completely liberated, the difficulties given to us by the enemy's division and blockade, control of rivers, and destruction of embankments to use water as a weapon no longer exist. In flood prevention work, we are now able to grasp the water conditions upstream and downstream and formulate unified plans, which is our advantageous condition. However, the embankments of the rivers in our region are still in disrepair, and the embankments in the newly liberated areas are particularly dilapidated and thin. This year's spring work was only selective repairs, and it was not possible to strengthen them universally. Due to drought and insect pests, the wheat harvest has been poor, and autumn crops have also been affected. If another major flood occurs, it will inevitably affect agricultural production and the supply of industrial raw materials, weaken the strength of support for the front, and transportation will also be greatly hindered. Therefore, this year's flood prevention will be an arduous and serious task. We should be fully prepared in spirit and action. Oppose any ideological paralysis and wishful thinking.
    2. The specific tasks of this year's flood prevention are: The main embankments of the main rivers must be resolutely defended. It is not allowed to breach the embankments before the flood level is less than five centimeters below the top of the embankment. For the embankments of other rivers, strive not to breach them under normal water levels. This is the task determined based on the current embankment conditions in our region and the size of the benefited area. In terms of mountain flood prevention, it is advocated to guide mass-based beach protection and siltation, and the technical requirements for flood prevention work should be raised one step on the existing level.
    3. Organization and leadership of flood prevention: Implement the principle of unified leadership and segmented responsibility. The overall flood prevention guidelines and plans for the entire region are controlled by the North China People's Government. Under the guidelines stipulated by the North China People's Government, and without affecting the interests of other regions, the administrative offices and provincial governments control the flood prevention work in their respective jurisdictions. In order to facilitate leadership, each administrative office region should establish a general flood prevention headquarters, and establish flood prevention headquarters for each river based on the river. Jizhong will set up six command posts for Hutuo, Daqing, Yongding, Ziya, Zhulong, and Nanyun Rivers; Jinnan will set up three command posts for Zhanghe, Weiyunhe, and Fuyang Rivers; Jidong will set up two command posts for Jiyun and Luanhe Rivers; and Ji-Lu-Yu will set up two command posts for Nanyunhe and Weihe Rivers. Under the river system command post, county command posts or flood prevention sections are set up according to administrative divisions or embankment sections.
    4. Preparations before the flood season: The first is ideological preparation. Before the major flood season, extensive and in-depth flood prevention education should be carried out for cadres and the masses to make them deeply understand the importance of flood prevention. The second is embankment preparation, inspect and sign the trial of the scouring dams and river embankments. Prepare quantitative materials for dangerous projects, set up hydrological and water level measuring stations and telecommunications equipment, strengthen flood reporting work, and accurately and timely grasp the water conditions.
    5. Clarify responsibilities, and strictly enforce rewards and punishments: After the river sections are divided, responsibilities must be clarified and reward and punishment methods must be stipulated. Rewards and punishments must be strict and timely. If it is not an irresistible situation, but due to irresponsibility and negligence in defense, resulting in a breach, no excuses will be allowed. And administrative sanctions should be given to the relevant personnel according to the severity of the circumstances. Another point is that flood prevention is not only a technical work, but more importantly a complex and meticulous mass work. Therefore, only when administration and technology are closely combined, and closely combined with the masses, with the leaders in charge and the backbone taking the lead, can the victory of flood prevention be guaranteed.

    华北防汛会议闭幕
    董主席勉励作好防汛工作
    各行署区要成立总指挥部
    【本报讯】华北首次防汛会议自六月十六日开幕，经过了七天的报告讨论，已于二十四日圆满闭幕。在昨天的闭幕会上，出席会议的各区代表及来宾共四十余人，华北人民政府主席董必武同志亦亲临讲话。董主席说：水利工作是华北全区的一件大事情，对于华北某些地区农业生产有决定的意义。华北全境河流纵横，但大部分是为害于人民的较多，人民能利用的较少，这因为人工未施，或虽加工而年久失修，以及长期战争中反革命的破坏等等，故一般说来，人民感觉河流对他们是害多利少，在目前财力、人力、物力都不可能的情况下，水利工作还只能作些消极的防汛工作，不可能从事大的治本工程，但只要我们能够真正把防汛工作作好，使不致造成重大的灾害，这就是一个很大的成绩。今年华北全部解放，各河已归人民掌握，我们的老的水利工作人员可以安心从事治河防汛工作，这和过去一面对敌一面对水进行斗争是很不同的。今年防汛，对于在座的新参加我们的水利工作者，董主席循循指示，应当认识到今后从事水利工作，就是为人民服务，和以前便有了基本的不同。董主席用几个生动的事例，说明在阶级社会里，每个人都是为一定的阶级服务的。过去在国民党反动统治下，也有些热心的科学家，愿意贡献出自己的力量来，以为是为人民服务。人民也许得到一点好处，但主要的好处是谁占去了呢？主要的是给谁帮忙了呢？还不是地主、官僚、独占资本家占去了主要的果实吗？今天新参加工作的同仁能有机会献身于新民主主义的社会了，这就是说，对于新参加工作的同仁，今年防汛比过去就有了基本的不同。董主席继又指出：在国民党反动统治下，很容易把一个事业机关变成了官僚机构。今天我们虽然打破了旧的官僚机构，但在小生产仍占优势的社会，官僚主义是不易被肃清的，我们必需警惕，在水利工作中，要力戒延迟、误事、敷衍塞责、脱离群众，不断地与官僚主义作斗争。最后董主席以勉励的口语，希望各地出席此次会议同志，总结过去防汛的经验，布置今后的工作，要使今年的防汛工作比往年作的更好。
    郝执斋同志总结报告要点
    下午由华北水利委员会委员郝执斋同志作总结报告，其要点为：
    一、对今年防汛应有的认识：现在华北已全部解放，过去敌人分割封锁，控制河流，破坏堤防以水代兵等所给予我们的困难，今天已不复存在。在防汛工作中，我们已有可能掌握上下游水情，并制定统一计划，这是我们的有利条件。但我区各河堤防，目前仍处于失修状态，新解放区堤防尤为残破单薄，今年春工工作又只是择险修整，未能普遍加强。由于天旱、虫灾，小麦已经歉收，秋禾亦受影响，如再发生大的水灾，必将影响农业生产及工业原料之供给，削弱支前力量，交通运输也将受到很大障碍。因此，今年的防汛将是一艰巨而严重的任务。我们在精神上和行动上应有充分准备。反对任何思想麻痹和侥幸心理。
    二、今年防汛的具体任务是：主要河流的主要堤防要坚决防守。在洪水位低于堤顶五公寸前不准决口，其他河流堤防在一般水位下争取不决口，这是就我区目前堤防情况及受益范围大小而确定的任务。在山地防洪方面，提倡与领导群众性的护滩放淤，防洪工作，在技术上要求在现有水平上提高一步。
    三、防汛的组织领导：贯彻统一领导，分段负责的原则，属于全区性的防汛方针计划，由华北人民政府掌握，在华北人民政府规定的方针下，并在不影响其他地区利益的条件下，各行署、省府掌握其辖区的防汛工作。为便于领导，各行署区成立防汛总指挥部，并以河为单位建立各河的防汛指挥部。冀中设滹沱、大清、永定、子牙、潴龙、南运河六个指挥部；冀南设漳河、卫运河、滏阳河三个指挥部；冀东设蓟运、滦河两个指挥部；冀鲁豫设南运河、卫河两个指挥部。河系指挥部下，按行政区划或堤段设县指挥部或防汛段。
    四、汛前的准备工作：第一是思想准备，大汛以前应对干部群众进行广泛而深入的防汛教育，使之深刻体会到防汛的重要性。第二是堤防准备，对埽坝河堤进行检查签试。险工准备定量料物，筹设水文、水位测站和电讯设备，加强报汛工作，准确地及时地掌握水情。
    五、明确职责，严明惩奖：河段划分后，要明确职责，规定奖惩办法，赏罚要严明及时，如果不是不可抗拒的情况，而是由于不负责任，疏于防守，招致决口，任何借口都不容许。并要针对情节轻重，对有关人员给以行政处分。另外一点，防汛不单是技术工作，而重要的是一复杂的、细密的群众工作，所以只有行政与技术密切结合，又与群众密切结合、首长负责、骨干带头是防汛胜利的重要保证。
