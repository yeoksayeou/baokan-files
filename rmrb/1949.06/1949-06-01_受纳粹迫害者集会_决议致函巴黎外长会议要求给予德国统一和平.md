Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, May 31st: TASS Berlin reports: The Third Conference of the Association of Nazi Persecution Victims opened in Dresden (Soviet Zone) on the 26th. Representatives from West Germany, Austria, Greece, Italy, the Netherlands, and other countries' similar organizations attended the conference, listening to a work report on the association's struggle for peace and German unification. During the discussion, Franz Dahlem, Secretary of the Central Secretariat of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany, emphasized that the German people's struggle for national unification is inseparable from the struggle to maintain peace throughout the world. Fried, a representative of the Christian Democratic Union in Berlin, called for the establishment of an international tribunal to deal with warmongers.

The conference delegates, representing the warriors of the German national resistance movement, adopted a letter to the Paris Council of Foreign Ministers, urging the four foreign ministers to find a solution to the German question that satisfies the German people. The letter stated: "The testament of millions of people who died from fascist terror is a convincing basis for this demand. We, the living, represent ourselves and them in demanding political and economic unity for Germany, and a just peace treaty with a unified and democratic Germany."

On the evening of the 28th, the working people of Germany held a rally in Dresden to celebrate the successful conclusion of the conference, with 50,000 people participating. The assembly unanimously supported the demands put forward by the association conference and called on the delegates to the Third German People's Congress to defend the cause of peace and the unity and freedom of the German people.
