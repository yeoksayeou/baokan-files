Tan Zheng, director of the Military Control Commission, pointed out that Wuhan's primary task today is to restore production, restore urban-rural ties, and restore foreign trade, and on this basis, develop production and build a new Wuhan. Employees should pay attention to: First, pay attention to unity, prevent gang tendencies, and prevent the provocation of lurking remnant enemies; second, cooperate with revolutionary intellectuals, unite with technical experts, and cooperate with progressive industrialists and democratic人士. Finally, he encouraged everyone to be prepared to meet difficulties and overcome difficulties. Deputy Director Tao Zhu said: We came to Wuhan and met with the workers first because the Communist Party is the party of the working class, and because building cities and developing industry must first rely on the working class. It is hoped that Wuhan workers will take the lead in assuming the responsibility of leading production. More than 190 representatives attended, and their speeches were very enthusiastic. On the same day, the Culture and Education Takeover Department convened a meeting of the heads of public universities, middle schools, and vocational schools in the city to announce the takeover measures. Minister Pan Zinian hoped that people in Wuhan's education circles would work hard to build Wuhan's new education under the new policy. The heads of the various schools enthusiastically reported on the situation in their respective schools and raised questions. Currently, most of the schools are continuing to hold classes as usual.
