Survey of Raw Materials for Heavy Industry
　　Personnel from the Ping Geology Survey Institute to Conduct Measurements at Datong Longyan

　　[Our Dispatch] The Beiping Geological Survey Institute, affiliated with the Enterprise Department of the North China People's Government, is actively conducting extensive surveys of coal and iron ore resources in North China to practically support North China's production and construction efforts. The measurement work of the famous Datong Coalfield in Shanxi is scheduled to begin in July. This coalfield, the largest in East Asia, is located in the plateau area west of the Kouquan Mountains on the Datong Plain in northern Shanxi, spanning the territories of Datong, Zuoyun, Huairen, Pinglu, and Shuoxian counties. The coal-bearing area is approximately 2,600 square kilometers, and the estimated reserves are 40 billion tons. This dwarfs the 1 billion tons of the Northeast Fushun Coalfield (with remaining reserves of about 420 million tons) and the 350 million tons of the Hebei Kailuan Coalfield (with remaining reserves of about 200 million tons, not including newly discovered coalfields), with a coal reserve roughly a hundred times greater than the combined reserves of the aforementioned mines. The complete measurement of this coalfield will take five years to complete the northern part, and in the first year, only a portion of the northern part of the coalfield will be subjected to precise measurement and investigation. This survey will require approximately fifty people, and unless there are special issues, it is scheduled to commence in mid-July.

　　The measurement and investigation of the Longyan Iron Mine is also one of the institute's current major work plans. This iron ore area includes Xuanhua, Longguan, Chicheng, Huailai, and Zhuolu counties, with discontinuous outcrops extending over 180 li. The Yantongshan area near Xuanhua is particularly rich, with an annual output of 1 million tons in this area alone, making it the largest iron ore area in North China. The primary focus this time is to conduct topographic surveys, which will begin simultaneously with the Datong Coal Mine survey, with an estimated 18 survey personnel. To support these two major industrial raw material geological detailed exploration and investigation projects, the institute has formally established a measurement team and a drilling team.

　　In addition, the Enterprise Department, to meet the needs of chemical industrial products production, has dispatched personnel from the institute to the Boshan and Jinniushan areas of Muping, Shandong, to investigate pyrite deposits. A preliminary investigation will be completed soon. At the same time, the institute has completed the investigation of the Zhaoyuan Gold Mine in Shandong. According to the gold mine investigation staff, the Zhaoyuan Gold Mine is a well-known major gold mine in the north with abundant yields. There are seven main ore veins, extending over 2,000 meters, with an average width of 4 meters and a depth of over 150 meters. The estimated reserves are 17 million tons, with safe reserves of 1.8 million tons. The gold content is estimated at 9 grams per ton. Currently, 600 tons of ore sand can be mined monthly, and the cyanide gold refining process uses froth flotation. During the refining process, numerous by-products such as pyrite, copper, lead, and zinc can also be obtained. Once the power supply issue is resolved, it is planned to produce 4,500 tons of ore sand per month in the future.

　　The work of the Beiping Geological Survey Institute after liberation has been integrated with actual production and construction endeavors. Even the internal investigation and research work of the institute is like this. For example, the institute has recently compiled tables of 36 types of important mineral resources in North China, including coal, iron, gold, copper, salt, alkali, sulfur, glass sand, and oil shale, specifying their origin, quality, reserves, and output for practical investigation and reference.

　　调查重工业原料
  　平地质调查所人员即赴大同龙烟测量
    【本报讯】华北人民政府企业部所属北平地质调查所，为了实际配合华北的生产建设事业，正积极进行华北煤铁矿等的巨大勘察工作。著名的山西大同煤田的测量工作，即将于七月开始进行。该煤田为东亚第一大煤田，在晋北大同平原西面口泉山脉以西的高原地带，跨大同、左云、怀仁、平鲁、朔县等五县县境，存煤面积约二千六百平方公里，煤之埋藏实量推测有四百亿吨，比东北抚顺煤田的十亿吨（残余煤量约四亿二千万吨）及河北开滦煤田的三亿五千万吨（残余煤量约二亿吨，不包括新发现的煤田），藏煤量约等于上述各矿的百倍。该煤田的全部测量工作，在五年内才能完成北部，第一年只能完成该煤田北部的部分精密测量调查。这次调查人员约需五十余人，如无特殊问题决定于七月中出发。
    关于龙烟铁矿的测量调查，也是该所目前重要工作计划之一。该铁矿区，包括宣化、龙关、赤城、怀来、涿鹿五县，矿区断续不下八、九处，露头延长一百八十余华里，尤以宣化附近烟筒山地带最为丰富，仅此一区年产量即达一百万吨，为华北最大铁矿区。这次主要是先作地形的测量工作，将与大同煤矿调查同时开始，测量人员预计十八人。该所为配合此两项重工业原料的地质详勘调查工作，已正式组成测量大队和钻探大队。
    另外企业部为了化学工业品生产的需要，已派该所人员前往山东博山、牟平金牛山一带调查黄铁矿，最近即可完成初步调查工作。同时该所已完成了山东招远金矿的调查工作。据金矿调查工作人员谈：招远金矿为北方著名一大金矿，产量丰富，主要矿脉有七条，延长在二千公尺以上，平均宽为四公尺，深一百五十公尺以上，埋藏量估计为一千七百万吨，安全量一百八十万吨，含金成份，每吨可含九公分，目前每月能采六百吨矿砂，用浮油选炼矿法氰化炼金。在提炼过程中，同时可得不少副产品，如黄铁矿、铜、铅、锌等。一俟发电动力问题解决后，计划将来每月可产四千五百吨矿砂。
    解放后的北平地质调查所的工作，已经和实际生产建设事业结合起来了，即使象该所内部的调查研究工作也是这样的，如该所最近把华北重要矿产煤、铁、金、铜、食盐、碱、硫磺、玻璃砂、油页岩等三十六种矿产的产地、品质、储量、产量等，均制成表格，以供实际调查参考。
