Xinhua News Agency, Dalian, 20th. The Dalian Steel Plant has established a production schedule system, which has initially overcome the disconnection between production departments and the waste of manpower and materials that existed in the past. The plant has many production units, and the interrelationships are very close. For example, rolling, wire drawing, and gold plating are one production process. If rolling is delayed even slightly, it will affect the progress of wire drawing and gold plating. In the past, because the various workshops were not closely connected, sometimes the wire drawing workshop had to wait for the rolling workshop to roll the wire material, and the electric furnace melted the iron, but the foundry workshop had not yet prepared the mold, which affected the completion of the production task. At the same time, in the past, because there was no stipulated production schedule, each workshop only knew the total task for a month but did not know the task for a day. The on-site director could not allocate work in a planned manner based on the task. Therefore, they were often busy and chaotic at ordinary times, but could not complete the task at the end of the month. In order to correct the above deviations, the plant began to establish a production schedule system in March, planning the output, labor, raw materials, and materials of each workshop on a daily basis according to the monthly total production plan, so that the production of each workshop was closely coordinated. The site allocates and inspects operations according to the schedule every day, and fills in the actual output, labor, etc. on the same day for the leadership to check. In this way, the factory took the initiative in terms of leadership, and the workers also strengthened their sense of responsibility because they knew the daily production goals. Since the plant implemented the schedule system, production efficiency has been improved.

    大连钢铁厂建立生产日程表制度
    克服各部门生产脱节与浪费现象
    【新华社大连二十日电】大连钢铁厂建立生产日程表制度，初步克服了过去各部门生产互相脱节和人力物力浪费现象。该厂生产单位较多，而互相关系非常密切，如压延、拔丝、镀金等场是一个生产过程，如压延稍有耽误，即影响拔丝和镀金工作的进行。过去由于各场联系不密切，有时拔丝场得等着压延场压铁丝料，电炉把铁化好了，而翻砂场还没有把模子准备好，因而影响生产任务不能完成。同时，过去因没有规定生产日程，各场只知一个月的总任务而不知一天的任务，现场主任不能根据任务有计划地分配工作，因此往往平时忙乱，到月底却完不成任务。为纠正上述偏向，该厂于三月份起开始建立了生产日程表制度，按照一月总生产计划，逐日计划各场产量、人工、原料、材料等，使各场生产紧密配合。现场每天根据日程表分配及检查作业，并填写当天实际产量、人工等，以便领导方面检查。这样工厂在领导方面掌握了主动，工人也因知道了每天的生产目标而加强了责任心。该厂自实行日程表制度以来，生产效率已有提高。
