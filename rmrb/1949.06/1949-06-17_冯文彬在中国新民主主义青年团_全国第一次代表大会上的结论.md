Xinhua News Agency, Beiping, 16th:

Comrades,

Our congress has reached its sixth day today. All the items on the agenda, except for the election, have been completed. After discussions in group meetings, delegation meetings, and the general assembly, everyone unanimously endorsed Comrade Ren Bishi's political report and fully agreed with the report on the tasks and work of the League, the draft work program, the revised draft of the League's constitution, and Comrade Jiang Nanxiang's report on the League's constitution.

This congress is an unprecedented congress of unity in the history of the Chinese youth movement. Everyone has conscientiously and responsibly studied and discussed, humbly reviewed past work, exchanged experiences from various regions, and expressed boundless respect for the heroic deeds of the youth representatives of the People's Liberation Army.

This congress made a scientific analysis and correct summary of the history of the past youth movement, thus making it more convenient for us to inherit the fine traditions of the history of the Chinese youth movement and enabling us to avoid repeating past mistakes and taking detours in our future work. The establishment and development of the China New Democratic Youth League is not an accidental event, but the inevitable result of the historical development of the Chinese revolutionary youth movement over the past thirty years. This congress further studied the basic tasks of the Youth League, the nature of the League, and the work of the League, and gained a clear understanding. It also made a basic summary of the experiences and lessons of the League's work in the past two and a half years.

The reason why this congress was able to achieve the above achievements is the result of the correct leadership of Chairman Mao and the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party. The Central Committee and Chairman Mao attach great importance to the establishment and construction of the Youth League.

Now, based on the discussions of the congress, I would like to address four issues of concern to everyone:

I. The Basic Lessons of the Struggle Against Erroneous Tendencies in History

The Chinese revolutionary youth movement and revolutionary youth organizations have a history of thirty years. This history has left us with many valuable lessons. Here, I would like to talk about a few main lessons in the past youth work regarding the issue of struggle against erroneous tendencies.

The first important lesson in the struggle against erroneous tendencies is the issue of vanguardism and youthism in youth work. Comrades have felt in their work that they are somewhat hesitant and dare not let go because they are not very clear about this aspect of history. Comrade Bishi's report has already made a clear analysis of this issue. I would like to add some supplementary explanations.

What is the essence of youthism and vanguardism? It is the relationship between the youth movement and the entire people's revolutionary movement. Does the youth organization stand above the Communist Party and the People's Government, commanding and leading everything? Or does it actively participate in all the work called for by them under their leadership? If this relationship is not properly handled, mistakes will be made. If it is placed too high, vanguardism and youthism will arise; if it is placed too low, liquidationism will also arise.

The Chinese youth movement, especially the student movement, has often played a vanguard and leading role in the people's revolutionary movement. This is a historical fact in the Chinese revolution. However, this vanguard and leading role of the youth movement is only within a certain scope and in a certain sense. The youth movement must consciously combine with the entire people's revolutionary movement and obey the overall leadership of the entire people's revolutionary movement. Although the Youth League should maintain its own independent system organizationally, the Youth League should be in a position to actively assist and participate in the work under the Party's general policy, rather than in a position to lead everything. It is the Communist Party, not the Youth League, that leads everything. The Youth League must obey the overall tasks of the entire revolutionary movement, the Party's general policy and general line. The Youth League must formulate its own work based on the calls and various basic policies of the Party and the People's Government, and actively participate in the entire struggle, becoming a powerful assistant to the Party and the People's Government, and becoming a shock brigade. Only in this way can the errors of vanguardism and youthism be avoided, and only then can the role of youth in the entire people's revolutionary movement be better发挥(fā huī - bring into play/exert).

The Youth League should, on the premise of not violating the greatest interests of the greatest number of people, try its best to guarantee and strive for the realization of the special interests of youth. It is wrong to deny or ignore the partial interests of youth. However, the partial interests of youth must obey the overall interests of the entire people. The two are combined and should not be opposed to each other. Only by taking care of the special interests of youth under the principle of obeying the overall struggle and overall interests of the people can the enthusiasm and strength of youth in the entire people's revolutionary movement be发挥(fā huī - bring into play/exert), and only then can the Youth League establish correct relationships with other organizations.

The second important lesson in the struggle against erroneous tendencies is the issue of closed-doorism and formalism in youth work. The essence of this issue is the relationship between the Youth League and the broad masses of youth, the style of the Youth League, and how to realize the task of uniting and educating the younger generation.

The Youth League is a mass organization of advanced youth. Some comrades only see its advanced nature and neglect its mass character and breadth, setting very harsh conditions for joining the Youth League, raising the standards too high, and even requiring the qualifications of probationary party members to join the League, fearing the entry of the broad masses of progressive youth into the League. This is wrong. This kind of closed-doorism and tendency towards a second party will inevitably lead to the League becoming a narrow organization, hindering the League's mass character and hindering it from carrying out the task of uniting and educating the younger generation.

Some comrades only see the mass character of the League and neglect that the League is an organization of progressive youth, separating themselves from the actual struggles of the youth masses and using formalistic methods to build the League without going through the conscious willingness of the youth; even some regions have absorbed 80% to 90% of all youth into the League, causing the Youth League to completely lose its advanced nature and core role. This is also wrong. These comrades do not understand the truth that we must rely on advanced youth organizations to unite and educate the younger generation.

What do we rely on to guarantee the advanced nature of the Youth League? This is: (1) based on conscious and voluntary entry into the League; (2) willing to strive for the cause of New Democracy and have active performance; (3) under the leadership of the proletarian vanguard Communist Party; (4) with Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought as the content of education. The Youth League established and constructed under the above four principles should strive for breadth in its organization. The Youth League we want to establish should not only have hundreds of thousands or millions of members, but also, as long as it develops according to the above four conditions, should have ten million or twenty million members. Only such a broad and powerful mass Youth League can shoulder the task of uniting and educating all the youth of China.

What does the Youth League rely on to educate the youth masses? Fundamentally, it must rely on Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought. At the same time, it must also rely on the correct and active actions and excellent and upright style of the Youth League and each member. And these are the application of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought in daily life. If the Youth League members are arrogant, overbearing, divorced from the masses, selfish, seeking fame and gain, loafing around, and not working and studying well, they will inevitably become divorced from the masses and become isolated. That would repeat the mistakes of closed-doorism and formalism in the past and fail to achieve the goal of uniting and educating the entire younger generation.

II. A Correct Start, Persist Responsibly

Comrade Liu Shaoqi instructed us: "The Youth League should not be established unless it is to be done properly and responsibly to the end. Sufficient and strong cadres should be equipped and given the necessary or required conditions, and it should not be allowed to drift on its own after a start." This instruction is very valuable. Since we started building the League, thanks to the correct leadership of the Party and the efforts of youth work comrades in various regions, we have made great achievements in the past two and a half years, and many places have had a good start and created a lot of experience. But this is only the beginning.

There are still two tendencies in the work of building the League that need to be overcome urgently.

One is to be hesitant and dare not let go to build the League from the masses. This is mainly due to a lack of understanding that we have more favorable conditions today than ever before. That is, we already have a powerful Communist Party to lead us; in particular, there are young and excellent Communist Party members as the foundation for building the League, and a large number of Party cadres as the backbone of the Youth League. This is the most important and powerful guarantee for the establishment and development of the Youth League. The mistakes in the past youth movement, after our review and correct understanding, can also become our favorable conditions in the future. Caution is of course good, but it should be distinguished from the thought of hesitation, distrust of the masses, and insufficient understanding of the power of the revolution and the people, because daring not to let go will cause the establishment of the Youth League and the development of its work to fail to keep up with the needs of the rapidly developing new situation, and will cause losses to the youth movement and the revolution.

The other is to let it drift. After the Youth League is established, it is left to its own devices, with no cadres, no leadership, and no established organizational system and regular work of the Youth League itself, and the result will inevitably gradually become an empty formality.

We should combine letting go with prudence. On the one hand, the leadership should not be timid and 包办代替(bāo bàn dài tì - undertake the whole thing single-handedly). On the other hand, we should not build the League without a plan, without leadership, and without purpose, and should not pursue numbers without a conscious foundation - any blind and sloppy practices are irresponsible to the interests of the people and the revolutionary cause. Excellent young party members and cadres should be given necessary training in a planned way to make them aware of the nature, tasks, and guiding principles of the Youth League before letting them go to do it, while the leadership should constantly provide assistance and supervision.

In order to establish the League correctly, first, the establishment of the League must be combined with various revolutionary struggles, revolutionary work, construction undertakings, production movements, learning movements, and ideological transformation movements. But this does not mean that we should mechanically and subjectively create any movements to trouble the youth masses, so as to cause them to say: "One-third of you are building the League, hindering the learning of two-thirds of us." Correct League building work must be combined with various actually existing and actually needed struggles, work, and movements according to the actual situation, to discover activists from the movements, to educate them, to raise their awareness, and then to absorb them into the League.

Second, the League must be built openly. But this must also correct the tendency of being open for the sake of being open, and we must remember that the purpose of building the League openly is: in order to make the Youth League truly a mass League, truly a League that is concerned and supported by the broad masses, and has flesh-and-blood ties with the masses, in order to enable the League to be supervised by the masses, to serve the masses wholeheartedly, to solve the difficulties of the masses, to help the learning of the masses, to lead the masses to work actively, to humbly listen to the opinions of the masses, to correct their own bad style of being divorced from the masses, and to establish the prestige and close ties of the Youth League among the masses through these practical actions and work.

Third, the League must be built in a planned, step-by-step, and led manner. It should start first in places where the youth masses are more numerous, more concentrated, and have better conditions, and then gradually be promoted, from point to surface, from small to large, from one factory to several factories, from one school to several schools, from one county to several counties. But it should not be 包办(bāo bàn - take care of something single-handedly) by a few cadres alone, working on typical examples in isolation, and not daring to let go and promote it, so that the typical example is over as soon as the cadres are withdrawn. The Youth League's own organizational system at all levels must be established immediately in order to regularly lead the work of the League.

As mentioned above, we have a correct start, and we must persist responsibly. Regarding this point, I would like to point out the following experiences that have already been gained in various regions:

First, there must be correct work guidelines and work content, as well as various methods suitable for the characteristics of the environment and the interests of youth.

Second, there must be sufficient work cadres of the Youth League and strong Party leadership, as Comrade Ren Bishi pointed out in his political report: "The glorious achievements of the Chinese youth movement are inseparable from the correct leadership of the Chinese Communist Party." Because the correct work guidelines can only be produced under the correct leadership of the Party; and sufficient work cadres of the Youth League are a necessary condition for adhering to and implementing the correct work guidelines.

Third, we must maintain close contact with the masses. The Youth League must establish its own excellent and upright style. Every member of the Youth League should be good at uniting the masses, contacting the masses, always caring about the cause of the working people and the interests of the broad masses of youth, and be willing to be a servant of the working people. The members should not only be able to live, study, work, and progress together with the broad masses of youth, but also become the most active and progressive elements of the youth masses. It is necessary to ensure that wherever there is a Youth League, the youth there will be more united, more active, work and production will be more active, learning will be better, and progress will be faster. Only in this way can the Youth League truly become a core supported by the broad masses.

Fourth, the Youth League should humbly, constantly, and tirelessly learn from all struggles and work, in schools and social activities. Every member should constantly study policies, study business and skills. Members should actively participate in social transformation movements, such as: breaking down the old social legacy of the exploiting classes that regards labor as shameful, advocating the view that productive labor is the most glorious and serves the working people, advocating production movements, actively taking the lead in participating in social services and public welfare activities, such as organizing construction teams, carrying out clean and sanitary movements, breaking superstitions, etc., and constantly exercise themselves and educate the youth masses in these activities, learning various knowledge.

III. How to Implement the Spirit of the Congress into Practical Work

In this congress, Comrade Bishi's political report is not only of historical significance to the Chinese youth movement, but also has a positive role in promoting our actual work. The congress also more specifically stipulated the tasks and work of the League, and formulated the work program and the League's constitution, which are all pointers for future work. These are all worthy of our joy. But we must know: the correct formulation of policies and resolutions is only the beginning of things. To persist in the resolutions that come from the masses back to the masses, and to turn the correct policies and resolutions into the reality of work, is a process that must go through hard struggle, and a process of preparing to overcome many difficulties in practical work.

To implement the resolutions of the congress, we must first conduct extensive publicity. Although the reports and documents of the congress have been published, this is not enough. Each of our representatives must actively publicize them to the Party, to the leading comrades, and to the broad masses after returning, and disseminate the resolutions of the congress and the work of the Youth League through local newspapers, magazines, radio stations, and various methods such as oral reports, meetings, conveyances, and separate discussions, and use various opportunities to disseminate the resolutions of the congress and the work of the Youth League.

Of course, our work cannot be satisfied with publicity. More importantly, we must do a good job in actual work, which will truly make the comrades who originally expressed doubts and opposition to the League building no longer doubt and oppose, and actively help and support us. Some comrades ask the higher authorities to support them, which is of course important, but if we only want the higher authorities to support us, but we have no backbone ourselves, or a very bad backbone, how can people support us? Therefore, the fundamental key to the problem lies in whether we can strive to earnestly implement the correct policies and resolutions, and whether we can realistically set an example of doing good work. There should be no sense of dependence or shifting responsibility to others. We must realize that our work in the Youth League is not for personal fame, position, or any other purpose, but for the cause of the working people, for the construction of a new society, and for the complete liberation of all of China and all of mankind. If we can work with such a spirit and understanding, then the policies and resolutions of the congress will surely be implemented in practical work and create great results.

IV. Strive to Unite and Educate the Younger Generation

The most important difference between the China New Democratic Youth League and the past Communist Youth League is that the New Democratic Youth League should be broader and more mass-based, and should prevent the narrow-minded closed-doorist tendency of the past. A strong Youth League is what we hope for, what the youth of the whole country hope for, and what the revolutionary situation requires. In order to make the Youth League a strong force, one of the keys is to cultivate a large number of revolutionary intellectuals. Many places have defined the scope of revolutionary intellectuals very narrowly, such as stipulating that only those who have participated in land reform or anti-Chiang anti-American struggles can be listed as revolutionary intellectuals. This understanding is inappropriate. We should understand that the current revolutionary situation has undergone fundamental changes, which has made the level of awareness of the youth of the whole country, especially the student intellectuals, universally and rapidly提高(tí gāo - improve/raise). The young intellectuals who are willing to strive for the construction of New Democracy are rapidly increasing day by day. In this case, it is not beneficial to the revolution if the scope of revolutionary intellectuals is defined so narrowly. I think revolutionary intellectuals are only distinguished from non-revolutionary and counter-revolutionary elements. As long as they are willing to work actively and study hard for the cause of New Democracy, they are revolutionary intellectuals. Those who study hard in the people's schools, actively participate in various activities, and are willing to serve the construction of a new democratic society are also revolutionary young intellectuals. We should recognize that in the construction of a new society, we need a large number of young people who can study hard, master technology, and become useful talents. Today, there are only more than one million students at the secondary and higher education levels in the country, which is far from what we actually need! In five years, we want to提高(tí gāo - improve/raise) the existing 10% of industry to 30%, and to build a backward agricultural country into an advanced industrial country, we need a large number of young intellectuals with scientific knowledge and skills to participate in construction work. Therefore, we need to strive to promote their progress, guide them to participate in the cause of the New Democratic Revolution, and should not let them be willing to make revolution, but we do not want them.

Another important key to expanding the Youth League is to widely absorb young workers into the League. In the future, the focus of the League's work will shift from the countryside to the cities, and urban work will mainly rely on the working class. In the cities, the Youth League should also first focus on the work among young workers. Special attention should be paid to cultivating young worker cadres. Young worker comrades should be transferred from places where the League building in factories has been successful, trained, and then sent to various places to carry out the League building work among young workers.

Comrades, we believe that since the first National Congress of the Youth League has established the correct policies and tasks of the League, as long as we advance under the leadership of the Party, according to the correct methods, and work hard, we will surely be able to victoriously shoulder the task of uniting and educating the entire younger generation.

　　冯文彬在中国新民主主义青年团
    全国第一次代表大会上的结论
    （一九四九年四月十七日）各位同志：
    我们的大会到今天是第六天，大会所有的日程，除了选举之外，都已进行完毕。经过小组会议、各代表团会议以及大会的讨论，大家一致拥护任弼时同志的政治报告，完全同意团的任务和工作的报告、工作纲领草案、修改后的团章草案和蒋南翔同志关于团章的报告。
    这次大会，在中国青年运动的历史上，是空前团结的大会。大家都认真负责地研究和讨论，虚心地检讨过去的工作，相互交流了各地的经验，对于人民解放军青年代表们的英雄事迹，表示无限的敬意。
    这次大会，对于过去青年运动的历史作了科学的分析和正确的总结，因而使我们更加便利于去承继中国青年运动历史的优良传统，并使我们今后的工作能够避免重复过去的错误，少走弯路。中国新民主主义青年团的建立和发展，并不是一件偶然的事，而是近三十年来中国革命青年运动历史发展的必然的结果。这次大会对于青年团的基本任务，团的性质及团的工作，作了进一步的研究，有了明确的认识，对于两年半来建团工作的经验教训，也作了基本的总结。
    这次大会，所以能够获得上面这些成就，是毛主席和中国共产党中央正确领导的结果，中央和毛主席对于青年团的建立和建设是十分重视的。
    我现在根据大会的讨论，提出四个为大家所关心的问题来说一说：
    一、历史上反倾向斗争的基本教训
    中国革命青年运动和革命青年组织，已经有了三十年的历史。这段历史留给了我们许多宝贵的教训。我在这里想说一说过去青年工作中，在反倾向斗争问题上的几个主要的教训。
    反倾向斗争中的第一个重要教训，是关于青年工作中的先锋主义和青年主义的问题。同志们在工作中都感到由于对历史上这方面的问题不大清楚，在工作上总有些缩手缩脚不敢放手。弼时同志的报告已经对这个问题作了明确的分析。我想再作一些补充的解释。
    青年主义和先锋主义实质是什么呢？就是青年运动和整个人民革命运动的关系问题。青年组织是站在共产党和人民政府之上指挥一切、领导一切呢？还是在他们领导之下积极参加他们所号召的一切工作呢？这种关系摆得不适当就会犯错误，摆得过高就会产生先锋主义和青年主义，摆得过低也会产生取消主义。
    中国的青年运动，特别是学生运动，在人民革命运动中，常常起着先锋作用和带头作用，这是中国革命历史上的事实。但是青年运动的这种先锋带头作用，只是在一定的范围内，一定的意义上。青年运动必须自觉地同整个人民革命运动结合起来，服从整个人民革命运动的总的领导。青年团虽然在组织上应保持自己的独立系统，但青年团应当是在党的总方针下积极协助和参加工作的地位，而不是领导一切的地位，领导一切的是共产党而不是青年团。青年团必须服从整个革命运动的总任务、党的总方针和总路线。青年团必须根据党和人民政府的号召和各种基本政策，来规定自己的工作，并积极参加到整个斗争中去，成为党和人民政府的有力助手，成为一支突击队。只有这样才能避免先锋主义和青年主义的错误，也才更能发挥青年在整个人民革命运动中的作用。
    青年团在不违反最大多数人民的最大利益的前提下，应当尽量保证和争取青年特殊利益的实现，否认或忽视青年的局部利益是不对的。但青年的局部利益必须服从全体人民的整体利益，这两者是结合的，不应当把它们对立起来。只有在服从人民的总斗争和总利益的原则下，照顾青年的特殊利益，才能发挥青年在整个人民革命运动中的积极性和力量，才能使青年团与其他组织建立正确的关系。
    反倾向斗争中的第二个重要教训，是关于青年工作中的关门主义和形式主义的问题。这个问题的实质是：青年团与广大青年群众的关系问题，是青年团的作风问题，是如何去实现团结教育青年一代的问题。
    青年团是先进青年的群众性的组织。有的同志只看到它的先进性，而忽视了它的群众性和广泛性，把加入青年团的条件定得很苛刻，标准提得过高，甚至一定要够候补党员条件的才能入团，惧怕广大进步青年入团，这是不对的。这种关门主义和第二党的倾向，结果必然会使团成为狭小的组织，妨碍了团的群众性，妨碍它执行团结教育青年一代的任务。
    有的同志只看到团的群众性，而忽视了团是进步青年的组织，脱离青年群众的实际斗争，不经过青年的自觉自愿，用形式主义的方法来建团；甚至有的地区把全体青年的百分之八、九十都吸收成为团员，使青年团完全丧失了先进性和核心作用，这也是不对的。这些同志不了解必须依靠先进青年组织去团结教育青年一代的真理。
    依靠什么来保证青年团的先进性呢？这就是：（一）以自觉自愿地入团为基础；（二）愿为新民主主义事业奋斗而有积极表现；（三）在无产阶级先锋队共产党领导之下；（四）以马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想为教育的内容。在以上四条原则下建立与建设起来的青年团，在组织上应力求广泛。我们要建立的青年团，不但应当有几十万几百万团员，而且只要按照上述四项条件来发展，应当有一千万、两千万团员。只有这样广泛而强大的群众性的青年团，才能担负起团结教育全中国青年的任务。
    青年团以什么来教育青年群众呢？在根本上必须依靠马列主义和毛泽东思想，同时，还必须依靠青年团和每个团员的正确积极的行动，优良正派的作风。而这些也就是马列主义和毛泽东思想在日常生活中的应用。如果青年团员骄傲自大，盛气凌人，脱离群众，自私自利，争名争功，吊儿郎当，不好好工作与学习；那就一定会脱离群众，走向孤立，那就会重复过去关门主义与形式主义的错误，就不能达到团结教育整个青年一代的目的。
    二、正确的开始，认真负责地坚持下去
    刘少奇同志指示我们说：“青年团不建立则已，要建立就必须认真负责地好好做到底。要配备足够的较强的干部，并给以必须或必要的条件，不要开个头就让其自流。”这个指示是很宝贵的。我们自从开始建团以来，由于党的正确领导，以及各地青年工作同志努力的结果，两年半来已有很大的成绩，许多地方都有了较好的开始，并且也创造了不少的经验。但这还仅仅是开始。
    现在在建团工作中还存在着两种急需克服的偏向。
    一种是缩手缩脚，不敢放手从群众中去建团。这主要是由于不认识我们今天已有比以往任何时候都有利的条件。这就是我们已经有强大的共产党来领导我们；特别还有年轻而优秀的共产党员来作为建团的基础，以及党的大批干部作为青年团的骨干；这对于青年团的建立和发展是一个最重要最有力的保证，过去青年运动中的错误，经过我们的检讨有了正确的认识之后，也可以成为我们今后的有利条件。小心谨慎当然是好的，但是应当同缩手缩脚、不相信群众、对革命和人民的力量认识不足的思想区别开来，因为不敢放手会使青年团的建立与工作的开展赶不上迅速发展的新形势的需要，会使青年运动和革命遭受损失。
    另一种是放任自流。把青年团建立起来之后，就听其自然，既无干部，又无领导，也没有建立青年团自己的组织系统和经常工作，结果就必然逐渐成了空洞的形式。
    应该把放手同谨慎相结合。一方面领导上不要畏缩不前，包办代替；另一方面也不要无计划无领导无目的地去建团，不要在没有自觉为基础的去追求数字——任何盲目的和马虎草率等作法是对人民利益和革命事业的不负责任。应该有计划地把优秀的青年党员和干部加以必要的训练，使他们认识青年团的性质、任务与建团方针后，放手让他们去做，而从领导上经常给以帮助和检查督促。
    为了正确地建立团，第一，必须把建团同各种革命斗争、革命工作、建设事业、生产运动、学习运动、思想改造运动等结合起来。但是这不是说应当机械地主观地去制造什么运动，去麻烦青年群众，以至引起他们说：“你们三分之一的人建团，妨碍我们三分之二的人的学习。”正确的建团工作，必须是按实际情况去结合各种实际存在、实际需要的斗争、工作和运动，从运动中去发现积极分子，去教育他们，提高他们的认识，然后吸收他们入团。
    第二必须公开建团。但是这也要纠正为公开而公开的偏向，必须记着公开建团的目的是：为了使青年团，真正成为群众的团，真正成为广大群众所关心、所拥护、与群众有血肉联系的团，为了使团能得到群众的监督，全心全意为群众服务，解决群众的困难，帮助群众的学习，带领群众积极工作，虚心倾听群众意见，纠正自己脱离群众的不良作风，并经过这些实际行动和工作来建立青年团在群众中的威信和密切的联系。
    第三必须要有计划、有步骤、有领导地建团。要在青年群众较多、较集中、条件较好的地方首先开始，然后逐渐推广，由点到面，由小到大，由一厂到数厂，由一校到数校，由一县到数县。但也不要由少数干部包办，孤立地去搞典型，不敢放手推广，以致干部一抽典型也就完了。必须随即建立起青年团自己的各级组织系统，以便经常领导团的工作。
    如上所说，我们有了正确的开端，还要认真负责地坚持下去。关于这一点，我想指出各地已有的如下几项经验：
    第一，要有正确的工作方针和工作内容，以及适合环境特点与青年兴趣的各种方法。
    第二，要有足够的青年团的工作干部，和坚强的党的领导，正如任弼时同志在政治报告中所指出的：“中国青年运动之获得光辉的成绩，是和中国共产党的正确领导分不开的。”因为正确的工作方针，只有在党的正确领导下才能产生；而足够的青年团的工作干部，又是坚持和执行正确的工作方针所必须的条件。
    第三，要与群众密切联系。青年团必须树立起自己优良正派的作风。每个青年团员应该善于团结群众，联系群众，时刻关心劳动人民的事业与广大青年群众的利益，甘心情愿当劳动人民的勤务员。团员不仅要能够同广大青年群众共同生活、学习、工作、进步，而且要成为青年群众中最活跃最进步的分子。要做到凡是有青年团的地方，那里的青年就更团结，更活跃，工作和生产就更积极，学习就更好，进步就更快。只有这样，才能使青年团真正成为广大群众所拥护的核心。
    第四，青年团应当虚心地，经常不疲倦地从一切斗争和工作中，在学校和社会活动中，努力学习。每个团员应当不断地学习政策，学习业务和技能。团员要积极参加社会改造运动，例如：打破以劳动为耻辱的旧社会遗留下来的剥削阶级的思想意识，提倡生产劳动最光荣和为劳动人民服务的观点，提倡生产运动，积极带头参加社会服务和公益活动，如组织建设队，进行清洁卫生运动，破除迷信等等。并在这些活动中不断锻炼自己和教育青年群众，学习各种知识。
    三、如何贯彻大会精神到实际工作中去
    在这次大会上，弼时同志的政治报告，不仅对中国青年运动具有历史意义，而且对我们的实际工作有积极推动的作用。大会也更具体规定了团的任务和工作，制定工作纲领和团章，这些都是今后工作的指针。这都值得我们高兴的。但必须知道：正确的制定了方针和决议，仅仅是事情的开始，要把从群众中来的决议，再到群众中坚持下去，把正确的方针和决议变成工作的实际，是必须经过努力奋斗的过程，要准备克服许多实际工作中困难的过程。
    要贯彻大会的决议，首先要作广泛的宣传。虽然大会的报告、文件都公布了，但这还不够，还要我们每个代表回去以后积极地向党、向领导同志、向广大群众进行宣传，要通过各地方的报纸杂志电台去传播，通过口头汇报、开会、传达、分别座谈等种种方法，并利用各种机会去传布大会的决议和青年团工作的情况。
    当然我们的工作不能满足于宣传，更重要的是要在实际工作中把工作作好，这才真正会使原来对建团表示怀疑和反对的同志，不再怀疑和反对，并且积极地帮助和支持我们。有的同志要求上级撑腰，那固然是重要的，但如果光要上级撑腰，而我们自己却没有腰，或很糟的腰，那叫人家怎么撑呢？因此问题的根本关键，是在于我们自己能否努力认真地把正确的方针决议贯彻下去，能否实事求是地真正做出好工作的榜样来，决不应存在任何依赖心理，或把责任推给别人。必须认识：我们做青年团的工作，决不是为个人的名誉地位，或其他什么目的，而是为了劳动人民的事业，为了建设新社会，为了全中国全人类的彻底解放。如果我们能够本着这样的精神和认识去工作，那么大会的方针决议，一定能够贯彻到实际工作中去，并创造出巨大的效果。
    四、为团结教育青年一代而斗争
    中国新民主主义青年团与过去的共产主义青年团最主要的区别，就是新民主主义青年团应该要更广泛，更带群众性，要防止过去狭隘的关门主义偏向。强大的青年团是我们所希望的，也是全国青年所希望的，是革命形势所需要的。为了使青年团成为一支强大的队伍，其关键之一是培养大批革命知识青年。许多地方把革命知识分子的范围定得很狭隘，如规定要参加过土地改革，或参加过反蒋反美斗争的，才能列入为革命知识分子，这种认识是不妥当的。应该懂得目前革命形势已发生了根本的变化，这就使得全国青年，特别是学生知识青年的觉悟程度普遍而迅速地提高，愿为新民主主义的建设而奋斗的青年知识分子，正一天天地在迅速增长中。在这种情况下，如果把革命知识分子的范围定得这样狭小，对革命是不利的。我想革命知识分子仅仅区别于不革命与反革命分子，只要愿为新民主主义事业而表现积极工作和努力学习的，就是革命知识分子。在人民的学校里努力学习，积极参加各种活动，愿为建设新民主主义的社会而服务的，也就是革命知识青年。应当认识：在建设新社会中需要大批青年能够好好学习，掌握技术，成为有用的人才。今天全国中等以上的学生只有一百多万人，离我们实际需要还差得远呢！在五年后，我们要将现有的占百分之十的工业，提高到占百分之三十，要把落后的农业国，建设成为先进的工业国，更需要大批有科学知识与技能的知识青年参加建设工作。因此，我们需要努力推动他们进步，引导他们参加新民主主义革命事业，而决不应该让他们愿意革命，我们反而不要。
    扩大青年团的另一个重要关键是广泛吸收青年工人入团。今后团的工作重心要由乡村转入城市，城市工作主要依靠工人阶级。青年团在城市中也首先要着重在青年工人中的工作。要特别注意培养青年工人干部。要从工厂建团已有成绩的地方抽调青年工人同志，经过训练后派往各地去开展青年工人中的建团工作。
    同志们，我们相信：青年团第一次全国代表大会既然确立了团的正确的方针和任务，只要我们在党的领导之下，按照正确的方法，努力前进，我们一定能够胜利地担负起团结教育青年整个一代的任务。
