　　Economic Construction Must Begin with Accumulating Wealth
　　Ri Xin
　　Since the liberation of major cities such as Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, and Wuhan, over 90% of the country’s industry is now in the hands of the people. How to restore production, increase production, and move towards new economic construction is the biggest issue at present. However, economic construction is not a matter for a few people; it is a major task that requires the joint efforts of all classes of revolutionary people across the country. Therefore, this task should be completed jointly by all the people of China.
　　China has suffered over a century of imperialist aggression and exploitation, especially the devastation by the Japanese invaders since the Anti-Japanese War, and the bone-sucking plunder by American imperialism and the Kuomintang reactionary regime. The country’s poverty has reached its peak. Except for the old liberated areas where production has developed to a certain extent, agricultural production has declined in all the Kuomintang-controlled areas and the newly liberated areas. Industrial production is nearly suffocated, national purchasing power is weak, and living standards have generally declined. This is the economic predicament we face. According to a friend who has worked in commercial banks for many years, the amount of deposits in commercial banks in recent years, when converted at current prices, is only equivalent to about one-three-hundredth of what it was before the "July 7th" Incident. The estimated property of the banks themselves is roughly the same ratio. If this estimate is not far from the actual situation, it is equivalent to saying that the people’s savings capacity has generally decreased to around one-three-hundredth. What a shocking change this is!
　　Today, as we are about to achieve national liberation, what attitude should we adopt? It’s simple: we must not allow this paralyzed and anemic state to continue. We must climb out of the quagmire of poverty and create prosperity anew. Of course, this is not an easy task, but it is by no means impossible. The key is that the people of the whole country must start accumulating wealth together, accumulating our family property bit by bit, from small to large, gathering fur into a robe, to serve as the foundation for our economic recovery and development. But there is a terrible obstacle in our path: waste. The phenomenon of waste is still prevalent among the relatively wealthy classes in some cities. Especially in Beijing, which has always been known as a consumer city, a large number of idle and parasitic people have been raised here. What they carefully study is how to eat well and dress well, wasting the blood and sweat of the working people to satisfy their personal enjoyment. In the vast newly liberated areas, most industrialists and businessmen, except for a few who truly understand the government's policies and dare to operate freely, are holding a negative wait-and-see attitude. They doubt whether the government will really allow private capital to develop, and whether the money they earn in the future can still be freely disposed of and used by private individuals. Some people are afraid of being called capitalists and of being said to have money, so they eat, drink, and waste as much as they can. Even some people who rely on salary income do not save, but squander as much as possible, regarding property as useless. This muddled view is very harmful to the country’s economic development. These people are just worrying needlessly, and have not thought that waste is the real and terrible enemy. They only care about immediate enjoyment, and have not considered the poverty that will follow after eating and using everything up. They seem not to know that a new democratic country still protects private property and private operation, and that private life still depends on its legitimate economic activities to maintain. The more people are able to save, the more secure they will be in life, and the greater their contribution to social and economic construction. Therefore, we believe that on the road to economic construction, whether in public or private, the first thing is to overcome this phenomenon of waste.
　　People of all classes should move forward towards developing production and accumulating wealth. Capitalists should boldly increase capital and develop their businesses. Workers and staff members should increase production with a new labor attitude, saving raw materials and improving work efficiency, increasing wealth for the country, and improving their own lives. After land reform, farmers should work hard to improve cultivation methods in order to increase yields, accumulate wealth, expand production, and become prosperous. Holders of idle capital should pool their capital and engage in productive enterprises that are beneficial to the people's livelihood. Only by relying on our own efforts can we get rid of poverty and move towards prosperity.

　　经济建设要从积累财富开始
    日新
    平津沪汉等大城市解放之后，全国百分之九十以上的工业已掌握在人民的手中了。今后如何来恢复生产、提高生产、以走向新的经济建设，乃是当前最大的课题。但经济建设不是少数人的事情，是要靠全国各阶层革命人民共同努力的大事；所以这一课题应由中国全体人民共同来完成。
    中国经过百余年来帝国主义的侵略和压榨，尤其经过抗日战争以来敌寇的摧毁和美国帝国主义及国民党反动政权的敲骨吸髓的搜括，国家贫困已达到顶点。除老解放区生产有一定程度的发展外，凡国统区及最近的新解放区，农业生产后退，工业生产近于窒息，国民购买力微弱，生活水准普遍降低，这是摆在我们面前的经济窘象。据在商业银行服务多年的一个朋友谈：近几年来商业行庄的存款额若按物价折合，只能抵“七七”抗战以前的三百分之一，行庄本身的财产估计起来也约略等于这个比率。假若这个估计与实际相去不远的话，那就等于说国民的贮蓄力一般都已低减到三百分之一上下了，这是一个如何骇人听闻的变化！
    在不久即将获得全国解放的今天，我们应该采取什么态度呢？很简单，我们决不应允许这种瘫痪贫血状态再继续下去，我们必须从贫困的泥沼中爬出来，重新创造繁荣。诚然这不是一件易事，但也决不是不可能的事。问题的关键是要由全国人民一齐下手积累财富，一点一滴地把家业积累起来，由少而多，集腋成裘，以为我们恢复和发展经济建设的基础。但横在我们前进路上有一个可怕的障碍，就是浪费。浪费的情形现在还弥漫在某些城市比较富裕的阶层中。特别是向称消费城市的北平，历来就豢养着一大批游惰坐食的寄生虫，他们精心研究的是如何吃得好，穿得好，浪费劳动人民的血汗以满足其个人的享受。在新解放的广大地区一般工商业家除一部分真正了解政府政策的人敢于放手经营外，有好些人在抱着消极观望的态度。他们怀疑政府是否真叫私人资本向前发展，今后赚的钱是否还能叫私人自由支配使用。有些人怕人说他是资本家，怕人说他有钱，于是吃喝浪费得过且过。甚至某些依靠薪金收入的人也不事积蓄，尽量挥霍，认财产为无用之物。这种糊涂观点对国家经济的发展是非常有害的。这部分人只是杞人忧天，并未想到浪费才是真正可怕的敌人。他们只顾眼前的享受，并未考虑到吃光用尽之后随之而来的贫困。他们似乎不知道新民主主义国家仍然要保护私有财产和私人经营，私人的生活还要依靠其正当的经济活动来维持；越是能够积蓄的人在生活上才越能有保障，才越能对于社会经济建设有更大的贡献。因此我们认为在走向经济建设的途中，无论在公私任何方面，第一件事就是要克服这种浪费的现象。
    各阶层的人们都应当向发展生产，积蓄财富前进。资本家应该大胆放手增加资金开展事业。职工们应以新的劳动态度节省原料提高工作效率增加生产，为国家增加财富，为自己改善生活。农民们在士改后更应努力改善耕种方法，以求提高产量，积蓄资财，扩大生产，发家致富。游资持有者应集合游资，从事于有益于国民生计的生产事业。我们只有依靠自己的努力，才能摆脱贫困，走向繁荣。
