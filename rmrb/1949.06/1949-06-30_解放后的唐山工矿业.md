　　Tangshan's Industry and Mining After Liberation
　　By Our Correspondent Lin Li

　　The Tangshan industrial and mining area, with over 80,000 workers, is one of the most famous industrial centers in the country. In the half-year since liberation, under the leadership and assistance of the national economy, the production volume of various public and private factories and mines has reached or exceeded the levels of the Kuomintang rule before liberation, and regular production and construction have begun.

　　As one of the lifelines of industry, the Tangshan Power Plant is one of the four major power plants of the North China Electric Power Company. It is equipped with generators of 10,000 and 15,000 kilowatts each. Due to insufficient capacity of the main transformer, the current power generation is 19,000 kilowatts. Since liberation, the plant has ensured the electricity supply for lighting and industrial use in Tangshan and quickly repaired the transformers and transmission lines in Hangu, enabling it to send one-third of its current power generation to Hangu, Tanggu, and Tianjin, which are in urgent need of electricity.

　　The steel plant was built by the Japanese puppet regime in 1943. This is the backbone of industrial construction. At that time, the Japanese invaders aimed to produce 500 tons of steel per month, but they failed to achieve it. After the Kuomintang took over, they continued to implement this plan, but they never achieved even half of the original plan. After liberation, the factory became the wealth of the people's country. Production in April had already increased to a record of 342 tons, which is more than 144% of the highest production volume in the factory's history. Currently, the factory's employees are preparing conditions in all aspects, and the plan to produce 500 tons of steel per month will be realized soon. The Guye Refractory Materials Factory, which is under the jurisdiction of the steel plant, sells most of its products to Tianjin, Shijingshan, and other places, in addition to being used by the steel plant itself. The output has also doubled compared to before liberation.

　　The railway factory, which ranks first in North China, has more than 4,800 employees and is divided into eight departments and thirteen sections, which are interconnected links in the entire work. Since liberation, the factory has repaired 80 locomotives and 1,032 passenger and freight cars. Before liberation, it took 1,500 workers to repair a passenger car, but now it only takes 800 workers, which means that the output has almost doubled. Recently, they accepted the task of the Northern Factory Affairs Conference and decided to strive to complete the national 200,000-kilometer railway network within five years. It and the Changxindian brother factory are responsible for the glorious task of repairing 60% of the existing dead vehicles in the second half of the year.

　　The Huaxin Textile Factory, which has 33,000 spindles and 550 looms, currently has more than 2,000 male and female employees and is a joint public-private enterprise. It stands in the center of the eastern Hebei cotton-producing area, with a steady supply of raw materials. However, under the Kuomintang's sinful policy of relying on American cotton and destroying the rural areas, Huaxin had to change from a day and night shift system to a single shift system due to insufficient raw material supply. After the liberation of Tangshan, the state trading organs supplied it with enough raw cotton and also contracted for the finished products. Therefore, it resumed the two-shift system within six or seven days after liberation. Now it can produce 25,000 pieces of cloth and 14,000 bales of yarn per month. In addition to supplying the vast rural areas of eastern Hebei, it also exports a part to the Northeast.

　　The Qixin Cement Factory, which is privately funded, has a history of 44 years. The stone reserves are extremely abundant. According to the current production situation, it is said that it can still be mined for 40 or 50 years. Before liberation, Qixin was in the midst of a dispute over closing the factory. At that time, there were more than 140,000 tons of cement in stock, and wages could not be paid. The workers' lives were miserable, and they applied to close the factory due to the inability to maintain production. After liberation, the state trading organs first lent money and cloth to allow them to pay the workers living expenses and bought up the cement coupons accumulated in the hands of the workers (a kind of check issued by the factory to the workers as wages), which solved the workers' food problem. Then, a large amount of cement was ordered at a fair and reasonable price that took into account both public and private interests, which cured Qixin's paralysis of swelling and wanting to die, maintained the factory's production, and gradually increased it. By May, it had reached the highest monthly amount of more than 15,500 tons before liberation.

　　The Kailuan Mine, which has been mined for more than 70 years and has reserves of 150 million tons, was once taken over by the Japanese puppet regime during the Japanese occupation. Originally, 60% of its coal production was transported south to Beijing, Shanghai, Hangzhou, Qingdao, and overseas, and 40% was sold to Beijing, Tianjin, and Tangshan. Since the Kuomintang launched the sinful war, transportation and sales have been difficult. At the time of Tangshan's liberation, there were one million tons of coal in stock, and the wages of more than 54,000 employees had not been paid for a month and a half, forming a deformed state of coal piled up like a mountain on one side and hundreds of people producing with empty stomachs on the other. The mine proposed to stop production to reduce the wage burden. In order to develop production and supply industrial production with coal, and to ensure the lives of employees, the National Bank successively loaned Kailuan a huge sum of 1.2 billion yuan and purchased its coal reserves with tens of millions of catties of grain and flour. The government put a large amount of coal in its own hands, which was actually support for Kailuan. In order to enable Kailuan to quickly resume production, the Beijing Agreement was signed in early June. In addition to announcing that Luan coal would not be subject to export tax when transported south to Qingdao and Shanghai, the government guaranteed to exchange coal for materials equivalent to 150,000 bags of flour per month, which was equivalent to paying all the physical part of the employees' wages for Kailuan, so that Kailuan could carry out production without worry. Thanks to the massive support and assistance of the People's Government, the Kailuan Mine has increased from less than 10,000 tons per day before liberation to 12,000 tons per day now, and is continuing to increase.

　　Tangshan ceramics industry, known as the "Jingdezhen of the North", is famous for producing electrical porcelain, sanitary porcelain, floor tiles, and chemical porcelain in addition to general porcelain. Ping, Shen, Beijing, and Shanghai all have Tangshan porcelain markets. The larger Qixin (now publicly owned) and private Desheng Porcelain Factories suffered the same fate of semi-shutdown before liberation. After liberation, through the state's multiple efforts to maintain and solve sales difficulties, the two factories now produce hundreds of tons of porcelain per month, and their business and output have exceeded the level of the Kuomintang rule before liberation.

　　The rapid recovery and development of Tangshan's industry and mining have stabilized the foundation for the construction of Tangshan. At the same time, it has extremely important significance for the industrial construction of North China and the whole country. However, how did it recover and develop?

　　First of all, the working class of Tangshan, at the time of Chiang Kai-shek's defeat and escape, organized factory protection teams and pickets in a heroic and tenacious manner. Under their day and night guarding, the machines and mines of each factory and mine were intact, which prepared good conditions for developing production after liberation. In the past, the industrial crisis left over by the Kuomintang seriously threatened the survival of Tangshan. Heavy industry was swelling and dying due to the lack of outlets for its products, and light industry was about to close down due to the extreme shortage of raw materials. When we entered Tangshan, each factory's inventory could not be sold, and food could not enter from outside. For a time, it became a serious threat. Under such circumstances, on the one hand, the Party Committee called on the workers to grit their teeth, overcome difficulties, and maintain production. On the other hand, the People's Government and the state trading organs, under the unified leadership of the Military Control Commission, concentrated their efforts to open up the relationship between urban and rural areas, and began to exchange cotton for Huaxin's cloth and transport the cloth to the countryside to exchange for food. If there were no trains or horse-drawn carts, they hired rickshaws and farmers' handcarts. In order to absorb grain into the city and solve transportation difficulties, the government transferred more than 50 cadres to go to the countryside to transport grain, and the trade unions and Party committees worked hard around the workers' food problem. Until three million catties of miscellaneous grains entered the city, the workers' lives and production could be maintained. At this time, on the one hand, we requested support from higher authorities in terms of funds, and on the other hand, the trading organs sent people to the Northeast and Beijing-Tianjin (which had been liberated at this time) to promote products. The opening up of foreign relations, coupled with the rapid repair of the railway, the arrival of Northeast grain, and the exit of products, turned from a situation of maintaining production to a state of recovering and developing production. Now, cement is exported to the Northeast in large quantities, and yarn and cloth are in short supply. Merchants from Chengde, Shijiazhuang, Changzhi, and Shenyang come to Tangshan to order electrical porcelain, sanitary porcelain, steel, etc. In terms of sales and raw materials, it is basically no longer a problem. The liberation of Shanghai and Qingdao gave Tangshan's industrial and mining circles a great excitement. If transportation can be restored quickly, it will add another layer of protection to the development of Tangshan's industry and mining.

　　Tangshan is a production city with a population of 300,000 (including the mining area), and 83,243 workers directly participate in production. Together with their families, they account for about three-quarters of the total population of Tangshan. Therefore, doing a good job in workers' work and solving production problems is equivalent to solving most of the entire Tangshan problem. In the past six months, Tangshan has made many efforts to ensure the lives of employees and stabilize production order, such as the in-kind wage system, buying coal tickets, flour tickets, and cement coupons (all wage checks) from workers at high prices, allocating daily necessities to workers at low prices, and organizing cooperative undertakings. This has stabilized the workers' emotions and promoted and developed production. From this, we can know that solving the problem of workers' lives is one of the important experiences of relying on the working class. Tangshan recovered and developed production in this way.

　　解放后的唐山工矿业
    本报记者  林里
    拥有八万余工人的唐山工矿区，是全国著名的工业重地之一，解放后的半年间，经国家经济的领导与扶助，各公私厂矿的生产量均已达到或超过了解放前国民党统治时期的水平，正规化的生产建设已经开始。
    作为工业命脉之一的唐山发电厂，是华北电业公司四大发电厂之一，备有一万及一万五千基罗瓦特的发电机各一部，因主变压器容量不足，目前发电量为一万九千基罗瓦特。解放以来，该厂保障了唐山的光明与工业用电，并很快修复了汉沽的变压器与输电线，得以把目前发电量的三分之一送给急需用电的汉沽、塘沽、与天津。
    制钢厂建设于一九四三年日伪之手，这是工业建设的脊骨，当时日寇以月产五百吨钢为目标，但未能实现，国民党接受后仍按此项计划进行，也始终未能达成原计划之半。解放后该厂成为人民国家的财富，产量早在四月份就提高到三百四十二吨的纪录，等于该厂有史以来最高产量的百分之一百四十四强。现该厂员工正从各方面准备条件，不久即可实现月产五百吨钢的计划。该厂所辖古冶耐火材料厂，产品除供钢厂自用外，大部出售于天津、石景山等地，产量亦较解放前提高一倍。
    位居华北第一的铁路工厂，有职工人员四千八百余，厂内分八系十三所，是全部工作中相互衔接的环节。解放以来，该厂修复了八十辆机车，一千零三十二列客货车。解放前要一千五百个工始得修妥的客车，现在只用八百工，就是说，产量几乎提高一倍。最近，他们接受了北方厂务会议的任务，决为五年内完成全国二十万公里铁路网而奋斗，它和长辛店兄弟厂担负了下半年内修好现有死车百分之六十的光荣任务。
    具有三万三千支纱锭，五百五十台布机的华新纺织厂，现有男女职工两千余，公私合营。她站在冀东产棉区的中心，有着源源不断的原料供给，但在国民党依赖美棉，摧残农村的罪恶政策下，华新却因原料供给不足将日夜两班制改为一班制。唐山解放后，国家贸易机关供给了她足够的原棉，又包订了成品，所以解放后六七天就恢复了两班制，现在她可以月产两万五千匹布，又一万四千包纱，除供冀东广大农村所需外，尚输出一部给东北。
    私人集资的启新洋灰厂，有四十四年的历史，石头蕴藏量极丰，按目前生产状况，据说还可开采四、五十年。解放前，启新正在闹着停厂的纠纷，当时存灰十四万余吨，工资无法支付，工人生活苦不堪言，因无法维持生产申请关厂停工。解放后，国家贸易机关首先借给钱和布，让其发给工人生活维持费，并收买积存在工人手中的洋灰卷（系厂方发给工人工资的一种支票），解决了工人的吃饭问题。继又以公私兼顾公平合理的价格订购大批洋灰，医治了启新膨涨欲死的瘫痪症，维持了该厂生产并能逐步上升，至五月份，已达到解放前最高月量一万五千五百多吨的数目。
    开采了七十多年，蕴藏量尚有十五万万吨的开滦矿，日寇时代曾一度被日伪接收。其产煤原有百分之六十南运京沪杭青与海外，百分之四十销于平津唐，自国民党发动了罪恶的战争后，运销不畅。唐山解放时曾存煤百万吨，五万四千余职工一个半月的工资未发，形成为一面存煤如山；一百饿着肚子生产的畸形状态。矿方曾提出停止生产以减轻工资负担。为了发展生产与供给工业生产以煤需，为了保障职工生活，国家银行曾先后贷给开滦十二亿元之巨款，并以上千万斤的粮食面粉收购其存煤，政府把大批煤积压在自己手里，实际上是对开滦的支援。为使开滦迅速恢复生产，更于六月初旬签订了北平协议，政府除宣布滦煤南运青、沪不征出口税外，保证每月以相当十五万袋面粉的物资换煤，这等于代开滦开支了职工工资实物部分的全部，使开滦得以无忧无虑的进行生产。由于人民政府的大量支持与援助，开滦矿已由解放前日产不足万吨的数目上升为现在的每天一万二千吨，且在继续提高中。
    素有“北方景德镇”之称的唐山陶瓷业，除一般瓷器外更以出产电器瓷、卫生瓷、地砖、化学用瓷而驰名，平沈京沪均有唐瓷市场，规模较大的启新（现为公营）与私营德盛磁厂，解放前同样遭受着半停顿的命运。解放后，经过国家的多方维持与解决销路困难，现两厂每月产瓷数百吨，营业与产量均超过了解放前国民党统治时期的水平。
    唐山工矿业的迅速恢复与发展，稳定了建设唐山的基础，同时，对华北与全国的工业建设都有着极其重大的意义。然而，它是怎样恢复与发展起来的呢？
    首先是唐山工人阶级，在蒋匪败逃之时，以英勇顽强的姿态组织了护厂队，纠察队，在他们日以继夜的守卫下，各厂矿机器、矿井完整无损，为解放后发展生产准备下良好的条件。过去，国民党遗留下的工业危机，曾严重的威胁着唐山的生存，重工业因产品无出路而涨饱欲死，轻工业因原料奇缺将倒闭，我们进入唐山，各厂存货售不出，外面粮食进不来，一时成了严重的威胁。在这种情况下，一面由党委号召工人咬紧牙关，克服困难，维持生产，一面由人民政府，国家贸易机关，在军管会统一领导下，集中全力打通城乡关系，开始以棉花换华新的布，把布运往乡村换食粮，没有火车、马车，就雇用人力车、农民手推车。为了吸收粮食入城与解决运输困难，政府曾抽调了五十多个干部专以下乡运粮、工会、党委都围绕着工人的食粮问题而努力。直到三百万斤杂粮入城，工人生活与生产才得以维持。这时，一面呈请上级给以资金支持，一面由贸易机关派员赴东北与平津（此时已解放）推销产品，对外关系的打通，加以铁路很快修复，东北粮来，产品出关，才由维持生产的局面转到恢复与发展生产的状态。现在，洋灰大批输出东北，纱布供不应求，承德、石家庄、长治、沈阳等地，均有客商来唐订购电瓷、卫生瓷、钢铁等。就销路与原料来说，基本上已不成问题。上海青岛的解放，给唐山工矿界一极大兴奋，如能很快恢复运输，对唐山工矿业的发展便又增加了一层保障。
    唐山是一生产城市，人口号称三十万（矿区在内），直接参加生产的工人八万三千二百四十三人，连其家属约占唐山总人口的四分之三。因之，做好工人工作，解决了生产问题，就等于解决了整个唐山问题的大部。半年来，唐山在保障职工生活，安定生产秩序上均做了不少努力，诸如实物工资制，高价收买工人中的煤票、面票、洋灰券（均系工资支票），低价配给工人日用品，举办合作事业等。从而安定了工人情绪，推动与发展了生产。由此可知，解决工人生活问题，是依靠工人阶级重要经验之一。唐山就是以此恢复与发展了生产的。
