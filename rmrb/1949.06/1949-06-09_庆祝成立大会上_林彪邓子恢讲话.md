Xinhua News Agency, Kaifeng, 8th. After the establishment of the CCP Central China Bureau and the Chinese People's Liberation Army Central China Military Region, all cadres of directly affiliated organizations held a grand meeting the other day to celebrate warmly. Lin Biao and Deng Zihui, leaders of the Central China Bureau and the Central China Military Region, personally attended and spoke, encouraging everyone to strengthen unity, concentrate on their work, and take on new and important tasks.

　　General Lin Biao said: "The Central China Bureau and the Central China Military Region have a large scope of jurisdiction. At present, only the entire province of Henan and most of Hubei, and part of Jiangxi have been liberated. The vast area south of the Yangtze River still needs us to liberate it. The establishment of the Central China Bureau and the Central China Military Region marks the beginning of new and important tasks. To realize this task, the most important thing is unity. Unity is the weapon of the proletariat in carrying out revolutionary struggle. The Chinese Communist Party's leadership of the revolution relies on the unity of the entire Party to achieve victory. Since the Seventh National Congress of the Party, the entire Party has achieved unprecedented unity politically, organizationally, and ideologically. This phenomenon of unity is a reflection of the greatly increased political maturity of our Party. Our tasks are very great, and our work is very heavy. We want to liberate the entire Central China region, to change the political, economic, and cultural outlook of the Central China region, and to improve the lives of the broad masses of the people. If we cannot do this, the people will not support us. Now, under the leadership of the Central Committee headed by Chairman Mao, all policies, lines, and principles are correct. The remaining problem is strength, and unity is strength. To achieve unity, we must cooperate with each other, help each other, respect each other, be of one heart and one mind, and pool our wisdom and efforts. As long as everyone is aware of this issue, we will definitely be able to do our work well. Of course, I am not saying that unity has already become a problem here, but because cadres from various regions are coming together, and their work experience, work styles, and living habits are different, everyone must pay attention to this issue. Secondly, everyone should concentrate on doing their work in the organs. The organ is a machine for revolutionary work. It is a form of organization of revolutionary forces. Do not think that doing work in the organs is being wronged, nor should you think that doing work in the organs does not provide practical training. The view of all problems should not start from personal gains and losses, but from the interests of the entire revolution. We must learn from comrades who have been working hard in the organs for ten, twenty years, and we must also learn from the comrades at the front lines. The comrades at the front lines charge into battle, not hesitating to sacrifice themselves. They can even sacrifice their lives, so why should we still talk about personal interests? We must be conscientious and responsible in our work, and act decisively and efficiently. All work must be properly implemented, and we must develop our own initiative and creativity in our work. This style is the fine tradition of our Party, and it is also the essence of the proletariat." Finally, he said: "We now have many large cities, and many comrades have entered the cities. After entering the cities, on the one hand, we must understand the difference between urban and rural life, and we must change our rural viewpoints, habits, and work methods; on the other hand, we must also prevent being infected by the corrupt life of the cities. We must not only maintain our own hard-working and simple style, but also use this good style to transform the cities."

　　Deng Zihui said: "Today, we are celebrating the establishment of the Central China Bureau and the Central China Military Region to accept the new and great tasks given to us by the Central Committee. Our tasks are very arduous. However, we have confidence. Because: First, the enemy has collapsed, and the liberation of the vast areas south of the Yangtze River will be realized soon; second, many places in the south of the Yangtze River used to be the birthplace of revolution, and there are still guerrilla activities now. The Red Army was born in these places, and the mass conditions are very good; third, we have the Fourth Field Army fighting in this area. The Fourth Field Army is a large force, with a large number of people, good weapons, great achievements, and a high degree of regularization; fourth, and most importantly, we have the leadership of the Central Committee headed by Chairman Mao, and the leadership of the Central China Bureau headed by Comrade Lin Biao. With these conditions, we will definitely be able to do our work well and complete our tasks, but this is only a possibility. To turn this possibility into reality, we must rely on everyone's joint efforts to do a good job. The first is the unity of the entire Party. Without the unity of the entire Party, without the unity of superiors and subordinates, without the unity of party members and non-party member cadres, even with the above conditions, we still cannot complete the task. Under the leadership of Chairman Mao, after rectification and study, the conscious mountain-stronghold mentality of the entire Party has been overcome, but the blind mountain-stronghold mentality still exists. The so-called blind mountain-stronghold mentality means that between this part of cadres and that part of cadres, due to differences in work experience, style, and methods, they only see their own achievements and advantages, and do not see the achievements and advantages of others. To overcome the blind mountain-stronghold mentality, we must take the best from each, discard the worst, help each other, and learn from each other. The second is to trust the Party. The leadership of the Central Committee headed by Chairman Mao is Bolshevik leadership, and the politics, lines, and principles are completely correct. We must faithfully implement the policies, lines, and principles of the Central Committee, and completely obey the orders of the Central Committee. Now the Central China Bureau and the Central China Military Region are headed by Comrade Lin Biao, which will better ensure that we correctly implement the policies, lines, and principles of the Central Committee. We must obey the leadership of the Central China Bureau and obey the orders of Commander Lin, just as we obeyed the leadership of the Central Plains Bureau in the past. Third, the entire Party must establish the idea of relying on the masses, and today, in particular, we must establish the idea of relying on the working class. In the past, we relied mainly on the peasants to engage in armed struggle and seize power; today, we mainly rely on the working class to engage in industry and construction. Only by mobilizing the masses, only by relying on the entire working class, uniting the peasants and other working people, striving for intellectuals, and striving for as many of the liberal bourgeoisie who can cooperate with us as possible, can we complete the great task of new democratic construction."

### 庆祝成立大会上　林彪邓子恢讲话

　　庆祝成立大会上　林彪邓子恢讲话
    【新华社开封八日电】中共中央华中局与中国人民解放军华中军区成立后，直属机关全体干部特于日前召开大会，热烈庆祝。华中局与华中军区首长林彪与邓子恢均亲自出席讲话，勉励大家加强团结，安心工作，担负起新的重大的任务。
    林彪将军说：“华中局和华中军区管辖范围很大，现只河南全省及湖北大部、江西一部已获得解放。长江以南广大地区，还要我们去解放。华中局与华中军区的成立，是新的重大任务的开始。为实现这个任务，首先最重要的就是团结。团结是无产阶级进行革命斗争的武器。中国共产党领导革命就是依靠全党的团结取得胜利的。自从党的第七届全国代表大会以来，全党在政治上组织上思想上达到了空前的团结。这种团结现象，正是我们党的政治成熟程度大大提高的反映。我们的任务很伟大，工作很繁重。我们要解放整个华中区域，要改变华中地区的政治面貌、经济面貌与文化面貌，要改善广大人民的生活。我们做不到这一点，人民就不会拥护我们。现在，在以毛主席为首的中央领导下，一切政策、路线、方针都是正确的，剩下的问题就是力量，而团结就是力量。要做到团结一致，就要互相配合，互相帮助，互相尊重，一心一德，群策群力。只要大家对这个问题有了自觉，就一定能够把工作做好。我这样讲，当然不是说在我们这里，团结已经成为问题，而是因为各个地区干部汇合在一起，工作经验、工作作风、生活习惯都不同，大家一定要注意这个问题。其次，大家要安心做机关工作。机关是革命工作的机器。是革命力量的一种组织形式。决不要以为做机关工作是受了委屈，也不要认为做机关工作得不到实际锻炼。一切问题的看法，不能从个人得失出发，而要从整个革命利益出发。我们要向在机关里埋头苦干十几年二十年的同志学习，也要向前线的同志学习。前线的同志冲锋陷阵，不惜牺牲，生命都可以牺牲，为什么我们还要讲个人兴趣呢？对工作一定要认真负责，雷厉风行，一切工作都要做得有个着落，在工作上发扬自己的自动性和创造性。这种作风是我们党的优良传统，也是无产阶级的本质。”最后，他说：“我们现在有了许多大城市，许多同志都进了城。进城之后，一方面，要懂得城市生活与乡村生活的不同，要改变乡村的观点、习惯和工作方法；另一方面，也要防止受城市腐化生活的传染。我们不但要自己保持艰苦朴素的作风，还要用这种好作风来改造城市。”
    邓子恢说：“我们今天来庆祝华中局与华中军区成立，就是来接受中央给我们的新的伟大的任务。我们的任务是十分繁重的。但是，我们有信心。因为：第一、敌人已经土崩瓦解，江南广大地区的解放很快就要实现了；第二、江南许多地方过去都是革命的策源地，现在也有游击队活动，红军就是在这些地方产生的，群众条件很好；第三、我们有第四野战军在这个区域作战，第四野战军是大部队，人数多，武器好，战绩大，正规化程度也高；第四，最重要的是我们有以毛主席为首的中央的领导，又有以林彪同志为首的华中局的领导。有了这些条件，我们就一定能够把工作做好，把任务完成，但这还只是一种可能，要把这种可能变为现实，还要依靠大家共同努力，做好工作。第一是全党团结。没有全党的团结，没有上下级的团结，没有党员与非党员干部的团结，有了上述条件，还是不能完成任务的。在毛主席领导之下，全党经过整风学习，自觉的山头主义是克服下去了，但盲目的山头主义还是存在的。所谓盲目的山头主义，就是这部分干部与那部分干部之间，由于工作经验、作风、办法的不同，只看到自己的成绩和优点，看不到别人的成绩和优点。克服盲目的山头主义，就要各取所长，各去所短，互相帮助，互相学习。第二是要相信党。以毛主席为首的中央的领导是布尔什维克的领导，政治、路线、方针都是完全正确的。我们要忠实执行中央的政策、路线、方针，完全服从中央的命令。现在华中局与华中军区是以林彪同志为首，这就更能保证我们正确执行中央的政策、路线、方针。我们要服从华中局的领导，服从林司令员的命令，正象过去服从中原局的领导一样。第三，全党要树立依靠群众的思想，今天，特别要树立依靠工人阶级的思想。过去搞武装斗争，夺取政权，主要是依靠农民；今天搞工业，搞建设，就主要依靠工人阶级。只有把群众发动起来，只有依靠整个工人阶级，团结农民及其他劳动人民，争取知识分子，并争取尽可能多的能够与我们合作的自由资产阶级，这样，我们才能够完成新民主主义建设的伟大任务。”
