A Proposal at the Paris Foreign Ministers Conference
    By Zhukov, Special Correspondent of Pravda in Paris
    The four foreign ministers have been meeting at the round table in the Palais Rose in Paris for two weeks. Tens of millions, even hundreds of millions, of people are eagerly watching their progress, hoping that the decisions of the Foreign Ministers Conference will ensure a peaceful settlement in Europe and consolidate world peace. But so far, these hopes have not been realized. The US, British, and French delegations are trying to force the Foreign Ministers Conference to accept their policies against the will of the people, hindering the possibility of reaching a unanimous agreement to solve the problems before them, to restore German unity, and to rebuild the four-power control as an indispensable condition for ensuring the restoration of German unity.
    At the beginning of the conference, the United States spread many rumors that the US delegation intended to insist on extending the system already established by the Western countries in the three-nation joint occupation zone to the entire Germany. One of the contents of this system is the "occupation statute" that indefinitely delays the conclusion of the peace treaty with Germany. The representatives of the United States, Britain, and France rejected the realistic proposal of the Soviet delegation (which provided a reasonable basis for a solution). After holding several separate, exceptionally secret meetings, they formally proposed extending the so-called "Bonn Constitution" and "Occupation Statute" to the entire Germany, actually abolishing the principle of unanimous agreement in the four-power control mechanism and turning the mechanism into a docile tool in which the Western countries had a reliable majority. The draft they put forward also stipulates the open modification of the Yalta Conference agreement on the issue of reparations.
    In view of all this, it would be too naive to believe that those who put forward obviously unacceptable proposals and at the same time talked about "immediately ratifying the North Atlantic Treaty" seriously expected that they could force the Soviet delegation at the Foreign Ministers Conference to agree to these proposals. Everything shows that they have other purposes: The authors of the unilateral London and Washington agreements, which separated West Germany from Germany, are trying to turn West Germany into their military strategic base in Europe. They are only concerned with keeping this base in their hands by preventing the restoration of German unity. Maintaining a divided Germany is exactly what they want. This is why, after the Soviet delegation resolutely and principally refused to accept the Western countries' draft as a basis for discussion, the US, British, and French delegations proposed to proceed to the second item on the agenda.
    In the press, they are talking more and more frequently about narrow economic issues, primarily the trade between West Germany and East Germany, which some representatives regard as the "real business" of the conference, and therefore brought the representatives of the Western countries to the Foreign Ministers' round table. The well-informed commentator Lippmann of the New York Herald Tribune sounded the alarm when the Western countries, including Germany, almost simultaneously entered a period of economic decline, with trade shrinking and the struggle for markets intensifying. Lippmann frankly stated that the West German state now being established by the Western countries will face a crisis unless its industry finds markets to sell its goods. Lippmann even more openly admitted that the Americans are not only concerned with finding markets for West Germany, but also with finding markets for themselves. He wrote: "The serious phenomenon of the world economy approaching a crisis is now undeniable—this is the case in Britain, Belgium, Italy, France, and Germany, and it is no better in the United States. ... We are entering the second year of the Marshall Plan with problems and conflicts that are known to responsible people in society but have not yet been explained to the public." Lippmann emphasized that the position of the Western countries "is not bright from an economic perspective," and he urged "bold and concerted measures to expand trade and open up markets to avoid the danger of economic depression."

　　巴黎外长会议上的一项建议
    真理报驻巴黎特派员朱可夫
    四国外长已在巴黎玫瑰大理石宫的圆桌会议上开会两星期。以千万计甚至以万万计的人民都殷切地注视着他们的进程；他们希望外长会议的决定会保证欧洲的和平解决，巩固全世界的和平。但是直到现在，这些希望还没有实现。美、英、法代表团力图强使外长会议接受他们违反人民意愿的方针，妨碍获得一致协议解决摆在外长面前的问题，恢复德国统一、重建四强管制作为保证恢复德国统一的不可缺少的条件的可能。
    会议一开始，美国方面即散布许多谣言说，美国代表团打算坚持将西方国家在三国联合占领区已经建立起来的制度推行到德国全境，这个制度的内容之一就是无限期拖延缔结对德和约的“占领法规”。美、英、法三国代表们拒绝了苏联代表团的现实的建议（这建议提供了合理解决的基础），在举行数次单独的异常秘密的会议之后，正式地建议将所谓“波恩宪法”与“占领法规”伸展到整个德国，实际取消四国管制机构中的一致协议原则，使该机构变为西方国家在其中掌握可靠多数的顺从工具。他们所提出的草案并规定公开修改雅尔塔会议关于赔偿问题的协定。
    有鉴于所有这一切，如果相信那些提出显然不能接受的建议、同时又谈论“立刻批准北大西洋公约”的人们认真期望他们能够强使外长会议苏联代表团会同意这些建议，就太天真了。一切事情显示他们怀着其他目的：将西德自德国割裂开来的伦敦与华盛顿片面协议的作者们，正在努力将西德变为他们在欧洲的军事战略据点，他们只关心以阻止恢复德国统一来将这一据点保留在他们手里。保持分裂的德国正是他们所希望的。这就是为什么在苏联代表团坚决而有原则性的拒绝接受西方国家的草案作为讨论的基础之后，美、英、法代表团就建议进行议程第二项。
    在新闻界，他们愈来愈频繁地谈到狭隘的经济问题，首先是西德与东德贸易的问题，这些问题被某些代表认为是会议的“真正事务”，并且因而才把西方国家的代表带到外长圆桌会议上来的。纽约先驱论坛报的消息灵通的评论员李普曼在贸易日益减缩，夺取市场的斗争日益加剧的时候，西方国家包括德国在内几乎同时进入经济下跌的时期，发出警号。李普曼坦白地讲：西方国家现在建立中的西德国家，除非它的工业寻找到推销商品的市场，将遭遇危机。李普曼甚至更进一步地公开承认美国人不仅关切于为西德寻找市场，而且也关切于为他们自己寻找市场。他写道：“世界经济迫近危机的严重现象现在是不容置疑的了——在英国、比利时、意大利、法国、和德国是这样，在美国也不比这差一些。……我们带着为社会中负责人士所已知但是还没有向公众解释过的问题和冲突进入了马歇尔计划第二年。”李普曼着重指出西方国家的地位，“从经济前途看来是不光明的”，他敦促采取“勇敢而协议一致的措施，扩大贸易，开辟市场，以避免经济萧条的危险。”
