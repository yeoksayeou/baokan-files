    Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 24th: The All-China Students' Federation yesterday issued a "Notice on Summer Vacation Work for Students in Liberated Cities," the full text of which is as follows:
    (1) The summer vacation is approaching. For many cities, this is the first summer vacation since liberation. This year's summer vacation is different from previous years. This year, under the leadership and with the help of the People's Government, we can carry out studies and participate in various activities that are beneficial to our physical and mental health according to our needs. We should seize this time to carry out summer vacation work in an organized and planned manner.
    (2) During the summer vacation, we should unite the vast number of students, study revolutionary theories and policies, participate in various construction tasks, and carry out various activities to serve the masses, so that we can integrate with workers and peasants and, through various work and labor, train ourselves. At the same time, we should also organize various cultural, recreational, and sports activities, as well as tutoring for schoolwork.
    (3) We must use various lively methods suitable for the requirements of young students to carry out summer vacation work. The following are some methods for your reference:
    In areas with a concentration of schools, set up summer student clubs by district, and hold regular youth lectures, symposiums, speeches, and debates to help students study social sciences, natural sciences, current affairs, literature, youth self-cultivation, etc. In addition, students can be organized to tutor schoolwork, help students who are struggling with their studies, and help students preparing to enter higher education during the summer vacation. The student club can have a recreation room, a library, and various sports equipment, and hold singing classes, drama groups, group visits, trips, and various entertainment evenings. Special attention should be paid to carrying out sports activities such as ball games and swimming.
    The local student federations, government education authorities, and the Chinese New Democratic Youth League should jointly organize youth academies, student homes, etc. These organizations, which have the nature of weekly training classes, will help students study revolutionary theory and youth work issues. The content of the study should be based on the ideological level of the students participating in the study, and the methods should be lively, flexible, and diverse.
    Organize work teams, service teams, and returning students to go to factories or rural areas to help workers and peasants learn politics and culture, and carry out cultural, recreational, sports, and health activities, while humbly learning labor from workers and peasants and learning the style of seeking truth from facts. In addition, according to the different current situations and tasks in various places, they can participate in various production and construction tasks (such as building railways and highways, parks, or schools, etc.) and various social services called for by the government, to cultivate labor habits and a life outlook of serving the people.
    (4) Local student federations should formulate summer vacation work plans according to the different situations in various places, and should discuss them with the government's education departments and the Chinese New Democratic Youth League to obtain their help and guidance. It is best to organize a summer vacation student work committee with them to strengthen the leadership of the summer vacation work and achieve consistency in action. At the very least, they should maintain close contact with the education authorities, the Youth League, and the teachers of various schools, and carry out work under their guidance and assistance.
    (5) We hope that the local student federations will send us work reports and summaries of experiences at the end of the summer vacation.

    全国学联通知解放区各城市学生
    号召抓紧暑期学习  参加各种有益活动
    【新华社北平二十四日电】中华全国学生联合会日昨发出“关于解放区各城市学生暑期工作的通知”，全文如下：
    （一）暑期即将来到了。对于许多城市来说，这是解放后的第一个暑期。今年的暑期与往年的不同，今年我们可以在人民政府的领导和帮助下，根据我们的要求展开学习并参加各种有益身心的活动。我们应该抓紧这个时间，有组织有计划地进行暑期工作。
    （二）在暑期中，我们应该团结广大同学，学习革命理论和政策，参加各种建设工作，进行各种为群众服务的活动，使我们能和工农相结合，并从各种工作和劳动中，锻炼自己。同时还应该组织各种文化、娱乐、体育活动及学校功课的补习。
    （三）我们要用各种各样的适合青年学生要求的生动活泼的方式，进行暑期工作。下面提出几种方式，供大家参考：
    在学校集中的地点，分区设立暑期学生俱乐部，定期举办青年讲座、座谈会、讲演会、辩论会，帮助同学研究社会科学、自然科学、时事、文艺、青年修养等。此外还可以组织同学补习学校的功课，帮助功课较差的同学，帮助暑期准备升学的同学。学生俱乐部内可设娱乐室、图书室及各种体育设备，并举办歌咏班、剧团、集团参观、旅行及各种娱乐晚会，特别要注意开展体育活动如球赛、游泳等。
    由各地学联和政府教育机关、中国新民主主义青年团联合举办青年学园、学生之家等，用这些星期训练班性质的组织，帮助同学们学习革命理论及青年工作问题。学习的内容应根据参加学习同学的思想水平，在方式上务求生动活泼和多样性。
    组织工作组、服务队和组织回乡同学，到工厂或农村中去，帮助工人、农民学习政治和文化，开展文化娱乐、体育卫生等活动，同时虚心地向工人农民学习劳动，学习实事求是的作风。此外，也可以按各地当前不同的情况和任务，参加各种生产建设工作（如修建铁路和公路、公园或学校等）和政府号召的各种社会服务，养成劳动习惯和为人民服务的人生观。
    （四）各地学联要根据各地不同的情况，拟定暑期工作计划，并应当和政府的教育部门及中国新民主主义青年团共同讨论，取得他们的帮助和指导。最好能和他们共同组织暑期学生工作委员会，以便加强暑期工作的领导并取得行动的一致。至少，也应该与教育机关、青年团及各校教员保持密切联系，并经常在他们的指导和帮助下进行工作。
    （五）希望各地学联在暑期结束时，将工作报告及经验总结寄给我们。
