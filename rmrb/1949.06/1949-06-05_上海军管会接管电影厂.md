　　[Broadcast by the Beiping Xinhua Broadcasting Station] Shanghai, 4th: The Cultural and Educational Management Committee of the Shanghai Military Control Commission dispatched military representatives Yu Ling, Zhong Jingwen, Wang Xuanhua, and others on the 2nd to begin taking over the film studios formerly run by the Kuomintang. On that day, they took over the former Kuomintang Central Film Photography Factory General Administration and the China Film Studio. On the 3rd, they also took over the Central Film Photography Factory's First and Third Factories. Because the employee protection organizations in the aforementioned three factories were well-established, the takeover proceeded smoothly. The military representatives expressed their condolences to and commended all the employees of each factory for their heroic protection of the factories before liberation, hoping that they would work with peace of mind and strive for the film industry of the new China. Furthermore, while taking over the Kuomintang's film studios, the Cultural and Educational Management Committee of the Military Control Commission announced the abolition of the reactionary organization that had destroyed and persecuted the progressive film industry for twenty years under the Kuomintang—the bogus Executive Yuan Ministry of Interior Film Censorship Bureau.
