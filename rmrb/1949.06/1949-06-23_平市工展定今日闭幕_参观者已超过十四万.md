    [Reported by this newspaper] The Ping City Industrial Exhibition, lasting eighteen days, will close today (the 23rd). This is the most joyous and exciting exhibition since the liberation of Beiping. One hundred and twenty-eight industries and more than 500 factories in the city participated in the exhibition, showcasing over 3,300 exhibits. State-owned industries from Shijiazhuang, Tianjin, and central Hebei also participated. From the opening day, people flocked to visit with great enthusiasm. As of 6:00 PM yesterday, the number of visitors had exceeded 140,000. Two hundred and forty units, including various organizations, groups, factories, and schools, visited collectively. The most notable feature of this industrial exhibition is the strong leadership and support from the People's Government. From the preparation to the opening and throughout the entire exhibition, the Beiping Municipal People's Government not only directly participated in all the work, but also contacted Tianjin, Shijiazhuang, and other cities, as well as the liberated areas of Northeast and East China, inviting industrial and commercial representatives to visit, exchange experiences, and achieve the goal of planned development of Beiping's industry. A total of more than a dozen delegations from Tianjin, Tangshan, Shijiazhuang, Baoding, Zhangjiakou, Shandong, Liaoxi, Shenyang, Hebei-Shandong-Henan-Yu, and Taiyue came to Beiping to visit. The Beiping Municipal People's Government's Bureau of Industry and Commerce, Enterprise Bureau, Trading Company, the North China People's Government's Financial and Economic Committee, the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, the CCP Beiping Municipal Committee, and the Military Control Commission and other leading organs, have repeatedly hosted symposia with various delegations to solicit opinions on the development of Beiping's industry and exchange information on industrial production in various places. In order to further solve the exchange of industrial raw materials and finished product sales and the exchange of materials between cities and villages, and between cities, the relevant departments held special meetings, making preliminary connections between Beiping and the liberated areas' towns and villages, which created favorable conditions for the development of Beiping's industry. Secondly, the preparation and organization of the exhibition were meticulous and thorough: it not only mobilized and absorbed more than 3,000 industrial exhibits that could represent Beiping's industry, but also absorbed the main industrial products from Tianjin, Shijiazhuang, Tangshan, and other cities to observe, learn from, encourage each other, improve technology, and improve quality. The exhibition is currently preparing to edit a special publication of the Industrial Exhibition, which will systematically introduce Beiping's industry and send it to various liberated areas for reference. The Industrial Exhibition also hired many experts and professors from Beiping to form a review committee to evaluate all industrial products participating in the exhibition in order to improve them. The third feature is that all the exhibits are tools and machines necessary for industrial and agricultural production and necessities of life, and nothing is irrelevant to people's lives. Almost all the inventions participating in the exhibition focus on the improvement of production tools. Professor Yan Ruo of Normal University invented an animal-powered irrigation machine that produces 4,800 gallons of water per hour, Yao Junchuan invented a moving sail compound windmill, and the waterwheels manufactured by the students of the Advanced Industrial School, and various production machines manufactured by the Agricultural Machinery Factory, all attracted the attention of visitors. Wang Dagang's use of garbage to make unfired bricks not only turned waste into building materials, but also made a significant contribution to urban sanitation.

    平市工展定今日闭幕
    参观者已超过十四万
    【本报讯】平市工展历时十八日，今（二十三）日闭幕。这是北平解放以来最使人欢欣兴奋的一次展览会，本市参加展览的有一百二十八个行业五百余家工厂，展览品三千三百余件。石家庄、天津、冀中各地公营工业也有产品参加展览。从开幕那天起，每日前往参观的人都极踊跃，截至昨日下午六时，参观者已超过十四万人。各机关团体工厂学校集体参观的有二百四十个单位。此次工展明显的特点，首先是人民政府的大力领导和赞助。从展览会的筹备到开幕及全部的展览日程中，北平市人民政府不仅直接参加全部工作，并同天津、石家庄等城市和东北、华东各解放区联系，邀请各该地工商业界前来参观，以交流经验，达到有计划地发展北平工业之目的。计先后来平参观的有天津、唐山、石家庄、保定、张家口、山东、辽西、沈阳、冀鲁豫、太岳等十余个代表团。北平市人民政府工商局、企业局、贸易公司、华北人民政府财经委员会、工商部、中共北平市委、军管会等领导机关，曾多次招待各地代表团座谈，征求对北平工业发展之意见，交换各地工业生产情况。为了进一步互相解决工业原料及成品推销和城市与乡村、各城市之间的物资交流，各有关部门并举行了专门的会议，使北平和解放区的城镇乡村取得了初步的联系，这就给北平工业发展开拓了有利的条件。其次是展览会的准备与组织工作细密周到：不仅动员与吸收了足以代表北平工业的三千余种工业展览品，并吸收了天津、石家庄、唐山等城市的主要工业品，以互相观摩互相学习和鼓励，提高技术，改进质量。现展览会正着手编辑工展特刊，将有系统地介绍北平工业，发往解放区各地参考。工展会还聘请了北平许多专家和教授组成评议委员会，对参加展览的全部工业产品加以评判，以求改进。第三个特点是全部的展览品都是工农业生产所必需的工具与机器和生活必需品，没有一件东西是与人民生活无关的。参加展览的一切发明，差不多集中在生产工具的改进。师大教授炎若先生发明的一小时出水四千八百加仑的畜力灌溉机，姚骏川发明的动帆复式风车及高工同学们制造的水车，农业机器厂制造的各种生产机械等等，都引起了参观者的重视。王大光利用垃圾作的不炼砖，不但使废物变成了建筑器材，对城市卫生事业也作了重大的贡献。
