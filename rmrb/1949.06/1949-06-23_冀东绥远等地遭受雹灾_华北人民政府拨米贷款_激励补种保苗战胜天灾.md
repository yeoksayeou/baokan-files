    Hailstorms Hit Eastern Hebei, Suiyuan, etc.
    North China People's Government Allocates Grain Loans
    To Encourage Replanting and Seedling Protection to Overcome Natural Disasters
    [This newspaper reported] The North China People's Government, in response to the severe crop damage caused by hailstorms in eastern Hebei, central Hebei, and Suiyuan on June 6th and 8th, has sent telegrams of condolence and proposed that the affected areas focus on organizing the masses to harvest remaining wheat and rush to replant and protect seedlings as the central task. It also emphasized that leadership should pay special attention to inspiring the masses' courage to fight against natural disasters, make persistent efforts to remedy the losses caused by the disaster, and strive to complete this year's production plan. It also pointed out the need to conserve and prepare for famine and develop sideline production without hindering agricultural production. To solve the seed difficulties faced by the masses in the disaster areas during replanting, in addition to mobilizing the masses for social mutual assistance and adjustment, the North China People's Government has allocated 150,000 jin of yellow corn to eastern Hebei, a loan of 2.5 million yuan to central Hebei, and a loan of 1.5 million yuan to Suiyuan, to be lent to households with particularly difficult access to seeds, to be repaid in the fall.
    Note: Thirty-one counties and eighty districts in central Hebei, eastern Hebei, and Suiyuan were hit by hailstorms on June 6th and 8th, causing an average loss of one-third of the autumn seedlings. In addition to reporting to the North China People's Government, local governments have sent people to the disaster areas to investigate the disaster situation, provide comfort, and organize the masses to vigorously harvest the remaining wheat and replant late seedlings.
