　　Nanjing Military Control Commission Announcement
  　Dissolving Enemy Special Agent Organizations
    [Broadcast by Beiping Xinhua Broadcasting Station] Nanjing, 5th. The Nanjing Military Control Commission issued an announcement declaring the dissolution of the Kuomintang bandit gang's special agent organizations that harmed the people: the Investigation Bureau of the pseudo-National Government's Ministry of Interior, the Secrecy Bureau of the Ministry of National Defense, the Second Department of the Ministry of National Defense, and all other reactionary organizations of the same nature. All public property and archives of these reactionary organizations are to be confiscated. The announcement orders all special agents to immediately cease their activities and to repent and start anew to atone for their crimes by performing meritorious service for the People's Government. The Military Control Commission will, in accordance with the policy of "punishing the ringleaders, not questioning those who were coerced, and rewarding those who perform meritorious service," give them lenient treatment. If they are still stubbornly persisting in carrying out counter-revolutionary activities, they will be severely punished and will not be tolerated.
