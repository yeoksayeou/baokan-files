　　The British Labour Government - A Tool of Imperialism (Continued from Yesterday)
　　By Harry Pollitt, General Secretary of the Communist Party of Great Britain
　　When capital in Britain proper finds no outlet, British capital seeks avenues of development in South Africa, Rhodesia, and other regions. Barclays Bank alone invested over 70 million pounds in South Africa and Rhodesia in 1947. The large monopoly company, "Imperial Chemical Industries," with the financial support of the Labour government, plans to establish a factory in Makhtani and is building a new deep-water port in Tanganvika at a cost of four million pounds. This is "private" capital investment, this is shameless imperialist investment, an outrage while Attlee is saying that "imperialism has disappeared."

　　How are these facts of imperialist aggression to be explained when the right-wing Labour leaders boast of their "noble political democracy"?

　　The status of Africans in South Africa is low. They have no representatives of their own in parliament. The vast majority of the population, the Africans, are represented by Europeans.

　　In the new Kenyan Legislative Council, only two of the thirty-nine seats represent the four million African people, and these two representatives are government appointees.

　　In South Africa and East Africa, racial discrimination is manifested in various cruel ways - housing taxes, poll taxes, and pass laws are often used to force Africans to work in mines and fields; genuine trade unions are prohibited, and strikes against low wages and poor conditions are suppressed with the utmost brutality.

　　Now, the unprecedented growth of the national liberation movement in the colonies is of great significance. The Burmese government has admitted that it cannot control the situation in the country. A similar situation exists in Vietnam. The people of Indonesia are engaging in guerrilla warfare to resist Dutch imperialism. The Nehru government has imprisoned 6,400 communists. This figure illustrates the immense growth of the mass movement in India.

　　We welcome the growing mass movements in colonial and semi-colonial countries that oppose British imperialism on the one hand and the local exploiters supported by British imperialism on the other.

　　We advocate the withdrawal of our troops from all colonies and the abolition of strategic bases.

　　If Britain continues on the old path of imperialism, it will inevitably conflict with the interests of the working people of Great Britain, and this path is unworkable. The fate of the British people and the colonial people is shared; they should unite closely as brothers and sisters, and in accordance with the principle that all peoples have the right to self-determination, work together to fight for the realization of genuine rights and end the enslavement of imperialism not once, but forever.

　　The British working class, in its struggle for power - a relentless class struggle against the Conservative Party and the right-wing Labour leaders - should always bear in mind that those accomplices who oppress the people are themselves slaves.

　　For British workers, the Labour government's imperialist policies mean a lowering of living standards, family poverty, and the loss of national independence.

　　All these great struggles require the full support and unwavering will to fight of the British working class, because we are now entering a situation where we ourselves need the firm support of the working class around the world - in fact, we, like the workers of other capitalist countries, need the assistance of the international working class to maintain independence.

　　For the above reasons, we must fight against all the conspiracies of the scab Deakin and his ilk to withdraw from the World Federation of Trade Unions and split the workers' movement. The crimes of the right-wing Labour leaders should be made known to the working class around the world. The true face of the right-wing social democrats has clearly told the world that they are loyal slaves of imperialism.

### 英国工党政府——帝国主义的工具（续昨）

　　英国工党政府——帝国主义的工具（续昨）
    英共总书记  波立特
    当资本在英国本部毫无出路时，英国的资本就寻找着向南非、路得西亚和其他地区发展的道路。单英国巴喀莱银行一家，在一九四七年投于南非和路得西亚的资本即超过七千万英镑。大独占公司，“帝国化学工业”，受工党政府财政的支持，计划在马克坦尼建立工厂，并以四百万英镑之代价正在坦干维加建立新的深水港。这是“私人”资本投资，这是无耻的帝国主义者的投资，是在艾德礼正说着“帝国主义已经绝迹了”的时候的丑行。
    在右翼工党头子们夸口吹嘘他们“高贵的政治民主”的情形下，这些帝国主义的侵略事实，又该如何解释呢？
    南非的非洲人的地位是低下的。在议会里没有他们自己的代表。占人口绝大多数的非洲人，是欧洲人代表着他们的。
    新的怯尼亚立法议会，三十九个议席，仅有两席代表四百万非洲人民，而这两个代表还是被政府指定的。
    南非和东非，种族歧视以各种残酷的方法表现了出来——房屋税、人头税和通行法常常被用为强迫非洲人在矿坑里和在田野间工作；真正的职工会是被禁止的，反对过低工资和恶劣境况的罢工受着最残忍的压制。
    现在，殖民地的民族解放运动的空前的增长具有重大意义。缅甸政府已承认不能够控制其国内情势。在越南也有着相似的情形。印度尼西亚的人民正在采取着游击战来抗击荷帝。尼赫鲁政府关在监狱里的共产党员已有六千四百人。从这个数字来看，说明了印度群众运动力量的巨大增长。
    我们欢迎在殖民地或半殖民地国家增长着的一方面反对英帝一方面反对被英帝所支持的本地剥削者的群众运动。
    我们主张从所有的殖民地撤回我们的军队和取消战略基地。
    如果英国仍走帝国主义的老路，它便必与大英全国的劳动人民的利益相抵触，这条路是行不通的。英国人民和殖民地人民的命运是共同的，他们应紧密地兄弟般地团结起来，依据一切人民有权自决的原则，协力斗争争取真正权利的实现，不是一次、而是永久地结束帝国主义的奴役。
    英国工人阶级在其争取政权的战斗中——这是一个向着保守党和右派工党头子的无情的阶级斗争——应时时刻刻牢记着：那些压榨人民的帮凶们，他们自己正是奴仆。
    对于英国工人来说，工党政府的帝国主义政策就是生活水准的降低，家庭的贫困，国家独立的丧失。
    所有这些伟大的斗争都需要英国工人阶级充分的支援与坚定斗争的意志，因为目前我们正进入一种局势，此一局势即使我们本身也正需要世界各地工人阶级的坚定的支援——事实上，我们和其他资本主义国家的工人相同，需要国际工人阶级的援助以维护独立。
    因为上述理由，我们便必须与背叛工人阶级的工贼狄金及其同类退出世界工联分裂工人运动的一切阴谋作斗争。右派工党头子们的罪行应昭告于全世界工人阶级之前。右派社会民主党人的真面目已经明白地告诉世界，它们是帝国主义的忠实奴仆。（刘雨田译自一九四九年四月一日“争取持久和平与人民民主”）
