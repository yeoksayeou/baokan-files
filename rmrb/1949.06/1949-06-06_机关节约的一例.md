Short Essay:

To implement the effort to overcome waste and practice strict economy, the North China People's Government has conducted thorough mobilization and specific organizational work. They have summarized the experience since entering the city, put forward specific economy plans, broke the old set of empirical economy methods, and focused on adjusting the system and improving management methods in order to fundamentally overcome the existing waste and unreasonable phenomena. The characteristics of this plan are: (1) It emphasizes the working principle of unified leadership and decentralized management, so that the responsibility for overcoming waste and practicing strict economy can be universally shared by each department, office, section, and individual. For example, after implementing the contract system for bicycle repair fees, the Supervision Institute trained correspondents to learn how to repair bicycles and water pipes. On the one hand, it saved expenses, and on the other hand, it received rewards. This is a win-win method for both the public and private sectors. (2) The implementation of this plan is imbued with the spirit of combining the economy system with political education. For example, saving water and electricity, turning off the lights immediately, washing clothes without wasting water, and driver competitions to save gasoline (the agency's cars have been reduced from 1.5 gallons to 1.1 gallons per day). These are the results of patient persuasion and education, especially after Chairman Dong's report to all personnel at the beginning of last month, and in-depth discussions and enlightenment of conscious economy in various departments. (3) At present, the problem of economy in government agencies is related to the adaptation of the agency's lifestyle to urban conditions. Therefore, it is very important to educate and guide administrative managers to strive to adapt to urban conditions and change the rural way of working. Finally, cooperating with this agency reorganization and simultaneously launching the economy campaign in government agencies will undoubtedly have great significance in educating all new and old staff members and carrying forward our inherent spirit of hard struggle, which is worth referencing by all agencies; but this is just a plan, or rather just beginning to be implemented, and we hope that it can be resolutely implemented in practice.

　　机关节约的一例
    华北人民政府为贯彻克服浪费现象，厉行节约，已作了深入的动员布置和具体的组织工作。他们总结了入城以后的经验，提出了具体的节约方案，打破了以往老一套经验主义的节约办法，而着重制度的调整与管理方法的改进，以便把现存的浪费不合理现象从根本上加以克服。这个方案的特点是：（一）强调统一领导分散经营的工作方针，使克服浪费厉行节约的责任能逐部、逐处、逐科、逐人地普遍分担起来。譬如：自行车修理费实行包干后，监察院培养通信员学会修理自行车、修理自来水管，一方面节省了开支，另方面得到了奖励，这是一种公私兼顾的办法。（二）这一方案的实施，是贯注了节约制度与政治教育结合的精神。譬如水电的节约、随手关电门、洗衣不费水以及司机竞赛节省汽油（该机关汽车已由每日一·五加仑减到一·一加仑），这都是经过耐心说服教育，尤其是董主席上月初对全体人员报告以后，各部门深入讨论启发自觉节约的结果。（三）目前机关节约问题，关联到机关生活制度的适应城市条件问题，因此，教育诱导行政管理人员努力适应城市条件，以改变农村的一套工作方式，是很重要的一件事。最后，配合此次机关整编，同时开展机关节约运动，无疑的在教育所有新旧工作人员，发扬我们固有的艰苦奋斗作风上，是有巨大意义的，值得各机关借做参考；但这还只是计划，或者说只在开始实行，我们希望能在实践中坚决贯彻下去。
