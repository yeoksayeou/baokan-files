　　The Third Day of the National Railway Work Conference
    Ma Jun Reports on Railway Work in Northeast China
    Relying on Workers to Implement the Responsibility System Achieves Significant Results, But We Should Prevent Simply Pursuing Numbers and Disregarding Regulations
    [Our Newspaper's Dispatch] The National Railway Work Conference of the Ministry of Railways was held yesterday (the 29th) for the third day. Ma Jun, the former Director of the Northeast Railway Bureau's Mechanical Department, reported that the Northeast Railway work has made significant progress in the past three years. Taking the efficiency of locomotives as an example: the daily mileage of freight cars in 1947 was 171.4 kilometers, which has increased to 319.1 kilometers this year (from January to May, the same below); the traction quota has increased from 19.3 to 31.3 (in winter); the average number of locomotives in reserve per 100,000 kilometers was 71 in the past, only 17 last year, and only one this year, which has now been completely eliminated; as for the number of locomotives used (average per 100,000 kilometers), it has been reduced from 583 in 1947 to the current 377. In addition, the mileage of locomotives between major inspections has increased year by year. It was 20,300 kilometers the year before last, 33,000 kilometers last year, and has reached 46,000 kilometers this year. Harbin has exceeded 50,000 kilometers. The above achievements are due to the Northeast Railway Bureau's reliance on workers, the implementation of the responsibility system, the efforts of all employees, the absorption of advanced Soviet experience, the strengthening of the planning and organization of mechanical work, the improvement of locomotive quality, the implementation of democratic management, and the overcoming of waste. However, the Northeast Railway Bureau still has many shortcomings, and accidents occur frequently. We must raise our vigilance and try to overcome and avoid them. He said: The implementation of the responsibility system has gone through a tortuous road. Initially, the Linkou Locomotive Depot of the Mudanjiang Railway Bureau failed in its experiment with the shift system, and the condition of the locomotives declined to an unsustainable state. It was then changed to a contract system, and then the "three guarantees" system of contracting maintenance, contracting inspection, and contracting guidance was implemented. This broke the old concepts and conventions, promoted a new driving system, and produced a large number of labor heroes and model deeds. Wang Xuezeng of Qiqihar, Li Yong of the "Mao Zedong" locomotive, Zheng Shude of the "Zhu De" locomotive, as well as Zhang Side, Sui Zhendong, and others, have all established model banners among railway workers. In particular, during the Jinzhou Campaign last year, locomotive No. 1195, driven by Mu Chengbin, braved enemy bombing with high revolutionary enthusiasm to complete the glorious task of driving the military supplies train No. 3005 directly to Jinzhou. Another example is this year's "Iron Ox" locomotive of Suihua, led by Du Xianyang, which completed 100,000 kilometers, exceeding two major inspections, becoming a national locomotive banner. Finally, Comrade Ma Jun pointed out that in future mechanical work, we must prevent simply pursuing numbers, oppose certain incorrect tendencies of disregarding regulations, arbitrarily advancing, and exceeding line speeds, strengthen labor discipline, improve technical levels, eliminate accidents, and advance in a planned and steady manner. Subsequently, Song Ligang, Deputy Director of the Mechanical Department of the Northeast Railway Bureau, gave an introductory report on the responsibility system of Northeast Railway. He explained that the responsibility system is an effective way to eliminate the phenomenon of no one being responsible in industrial production. Our new democratic state enterprises are owned by the people and serve the people. There is no relationship of people exploiting people. Workers, with the attitude of masters, take their own responsibilities. This is something that capitalist countries' enterprises cannot dream of. In the afternoon, Du Xianyang, the driver of locomotive No. 96 of the Harbin Bureau, Su Yisheng, the driver of the "May 1st Labor" locomotive of the Pingjin Bureau, and Shang Baoheng, the driver of the "Mao Zedong" locomotive, gave typical reports on the contract system, detailing how they cared for the locomotives, overcame difficulties, united and helped each other, worked hard to learn, and created glorious achievements in the process of the contract system.

　　全国机务会议第三日
    马钧报告东北铁路工作
    依靠工人实施负责制获显著成绩  但应防止单纯追求数字不守规章
    【本报讯】铁道部全国机务会议昨（二十九）日为第三日。东北铁路总局原机务部长马钧报告，他指出三年来东北铁路工作有显著的进步，以机车的效率来讲：货车日车公里一九四七年为一七一·四公里，今年（一至五月，下同）增至三一九·一公里；牵引定数由一九·三提高到三一·三（冬季）；十万公里平均有火机车预备，过去有七十一台，去年仅十七台，今年只有一台，现在已根本取销；至于使用机车台数（十万公里平均数）由一九四七年五八三台减为现在三七七台。此外机车在甲检间行车公里一年比一年增进，前年为二万零三百公里，去年为三万三千公里，今年已达到四万六千公里，哈尔滨已超过五万公里。以上的成绩是由于东北铁路局依靠了工人，实施了负责制，经全体员工的努力，并吸收了苏联进步的经验，加强了机务工作的计划性组织性，提高了机车质量，实行民主管理，克服了浪费现象的结果。但东北铁路局还存在着许多缺点，事故经常发生，一定要提高警惕，设法加以克服避免。他说：负责制的推行，经历了一段曲折的道路。最初牡丹江铁路局林口机务段试验轮乘制失败，机车状态下降到不可维持的状态，才改为包车制，进而实行了包修、包检、包指导的三包制。打破了过去旧的观念与成规，推进了新的行车制，涌现了大批的劳模英雄与模范事迹，齐齐哈尔的王学增，“毛泽东号”的李永，“朱德号”的郑树德以及张思德、随振东等，都在铁路工人中树起了模范的旗帜。特别去年锦州战役时，一一九五号机车穆成斌冒敌机轰炸，以高度的革命热情，完成军火列车三○○五次直开锦州的光辉任务。再如今年二月绥化铁牛号机车由杜先阳领导完成超过两个甲检走行了十万公里，成为全国机车的旗帜。最后马钧同志提示以后机务工作，要防止单纯追求数字，反对某些不顾规章，随便冒进与超过线路速度的不正确倾向，加强劳动纪律，提高技术水平，消灭事故，有计划地稳健前进。继由东北铁路局机务部副部长宋立纲对东北铁路负责制作介绍报告。他说明负责制是消灭工业生产中无人负责现象的有效办法，我们新民主主义的国家企业是为人民所有，为人民服务，没有人剥削人的关系，工人以主人翁的态度，负起自己的责任，这是资本主义国家的企业所梦想不到的。下午是哈尔滨局九六号机车司机杜先阳、平津局“五一劳动号”司机苏宜生、“毛泽东号”司机商宝恒的包车制典型报告，详细讲述在包车制的过程中，他们如何爱护机车，克服困难，如何团结互助，努力学习，创造了光荣的成绩。
