(Tangshan Electric) The Kailuan Mine Workers' Preparatory Committee in Tangshan has resolved to abolish the Third Group Contractor's Offices (包工大柜), which workers hate the most. There are more than thirty Contractor's Offices in the Kailuan mines, which have cruelly exploited and oppressed workers for decades. Workers have waged many struggles to abolish the contractor's offices, but they have not been successful. After liberation, all outside workers (外工, workers employed by the Contractor's Offices) raised this urgent demand again. The Tangshan Mine has thirteen Contractor's Offices, and in early May, they twice withheld wages issued to workers by the mine, totaling 7.8 million yuan in Renminbi. After this incident was discovered by the Workers' Preparatory Committee, it increased the workers' resentment towards the Contractor's Offices and demanded the immediate abolition of the contractor system. Under the leadership of the Workers' Preparatory Committee, the mine workers formed a "Contractor System Research Committee" to prepare for the abolition of the contractor system. On May 16th, the Workers' Preparatory Committee and the Contractor System Research Committee held a joint meeting and formulated a draft plan for abolishing the contractor system in the Tangshan Mine. On the 18th, a workers' representative conference was held and passed the plan, and it was decided to first abolish the Third Group Contractor's Office in the mine, which most severely oppressed the workers underground. Instead, workers would form partnerships and directly sign contracts with the mine. The assets and tools of the Contractor's Office of the Third Group would be taken over by the workers of the group first (not involving the industrial and commercial parts outside the Contractor's Office). Pan Shaotang, the contractor boss who committed the most heinous crimes, will be handed over to the People's Court for handling. In addition, the staff and underground supervisors and inspectors originally employed by the Contractor's Office will be allowed to stay in their original positions and be retained based on their abilities. Efforts will also be made to persuade the underground foremen to change their style of work and continue to serve. In principle, the existing underground production management system will remain unchanged for the time being. A "Workers' Production Cooperative" of their own will be established as an organization for future production management to preside over the takeover work. A committee will be set up within the cooperative to determine the cooperative's business policy. In addition, one director and one deputy director of the cooperative will be elected or hired to implement the committee's resolutions and handle the cooperative's routine affairs. These candidates will be selected from among the group's worker representatives and workers. The cooperative will regularly report on its business to the group's worker representatives and publish a list of accounts on schedule.

　　开滦矿职工筹委会制定办法
  　废除包工制度　取消层层中间剥削
    【唐山电】唐山开滦矿职工筹委会决议取消工人最痛恨的第三组包工大柜。开滦各矿共有三十多个包工大柜，几十年来一直居中残酷地剥削压迫工人。工人们为取消包工柜，曾进行过多次斗争，未能实现。解放后，所有外工（包工大柜所雇用的工人）又提出此迫切要求。唐山矿共有包工大柜十三家，五月上旬曾两次扣押了矿方发给工人的工资共达人民币七百八十万元之多。这一事件经职工筹委会查觉后，更增加了工人对包工大柜的愤恨，要求立即取消包工制。该矿职工遂在职工筹委会领导下，组成了“包工研究委员会”，进行取消包工制的准备工作。五月十六日，职工筹委会及包工研究委员会联合开会，制订了在唐山矿取消包工制度的办法草案。十八日召开职工代表大会通过，并决定首先取消该矿井下欺压工人最厉害的第三组的包工大柜，改由工人伙包，直接与矿方订立合同。将该组包工大柜的资财、工具由该组工人先行接管（不牵连大柜以外的工商业部分）。对其罪大恶极的包工头子潘少棠，则送交人民法院处理。此外，原为包工大柜雇用的职员和井下总管、查工等，则着其各守原职，量才留用。井下的外工头子，也将尽力争取其改变作风，继续服务。原有的井下生产管理制度，原则上暂不变动。另成立工人自己的“工人生产合作社”，作为今后生产管理的组织，主持接管工作。合作社内设立一个委员会，决定社内经营方针。另推选或聘请合作社的正副主任各一人，执行委员会的决议及处理社内经常事务。这些人选都在该组工人代表及工人中产生。合作社要定期向该组工人代表会作业务报告，并按期公布帐目清单。
