The following is the body of the article:

    [This Newspaper's Dispatch] Worker education in Beiping has achieved universal success in the past four months, gradually raising workers' class consciousness and political level. In the early days of liberation, work teams in various enterprises used large-class lectures to conduct current affairs education, explain industrial and commercial policies, and expose the Kuomintang's deceptive propaganda. Workers' emotions began to stabilize, and public and private enterprises were able to quickly resume work. Subsequently, workers were mobilized to assist in takeover work, cultivating workers' sense of ownership, and many activists emerged. With the development of the "Welcoming May Day" production competition, workers' studies in various public enterprises also initially became regularized. According to statistics at the end of April: in the city's fourteen public enterprises, 9,667 people participated in study groups, and eleven units ran 31 training courses, with 5,891 people receiving short-term training. In May, a worker training course was also opened under the direct leadership of the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions to cultivate worker movement cadres, and it is planned to expand it into a worker school in the future. During this period, workers mostly studied documents such as the Communist Party and the Working Class, the History of the Chinese Communist Party, and Industrial and Commercial Policies, and the Labor-Capital Resolution. Workers gained further awareness, enabling the smooth formal establishment of trade unions in various public enterprises in succession at the end of April, with more than 80% of employees joining the trade unions. At the same time, the education of workers in private enterprises and industries is also vigorously developing under the leadership of the Municipal Education Bureau and work teams in various districts. From mid-March to the end of May, the city has organized 122 spare-time study classes and 48 study groups, with more than 7,200 workers and other laborers participating in the study.
    The reasons for the above achievements are mainly the result of the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions and the Education Bureau paying attention to leadership and the concern and assistance of enterprise administrations.

　　平总工会、教育局注意政治教育
  　职工阶级觉悟提高
  　公营企业职工十分之八加入工会
    【本报讯】北平市的职工教育，四个月来普遍获得成绩，逐步提高了工人的阶级觉悟与政治水平。解放初期，各企业工作组曾用上大课方式普遍进行时事教育，解释工商业政策，揭发国民党欺骗宣传，职工情绪开始安定，公私企业得以迅速复工。继而发动职工协助接管工作，培植了职工的主人翁意识，涌现出许多积极分子。随着“迎五一”生产竞赛的开展，各公营企业职工学习也初步走上正规。据四月底统计：全市十四个公营企业工厂中，有九千六百六十七人参加学习小组，十一个单位开办了三十一期训练班，五千八百九十一人受到短期训练。五月又在市总工会直接领导下开办一期职工训练班，培植工运工作干部，今后并拟扩大为职工学校。在此期间，工人们多学习了共产党与工人阶级、中共党史，及工商业政策、劳大决议等文件，工人们有了进一步的觉悟，使各公营企业能在四月底顺利地相继正式成立了职工会，百分之八十以上职工加入工会。同时，私营企业及行业工人的教育也在市教育局及各区工作组领导下蓬勃展开。自三月中旬至五月底，全市已组织了一百二十二个业余学习班，四十八个学习组，参加学习的工人及其他劳动者已有七千二百多人。
    取得以上成绩的原因，主要是市总工会及教育局注意领导和企业行政上的关心和协助的结果。
