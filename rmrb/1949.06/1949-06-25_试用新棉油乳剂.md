    Trial Use of New Cottonseed Oil Emulsion
    Department of Technological Improvement, Ministry of Agriculture
    Aphids are a major enemy that harms cotton seedlings every year. To ensure a good cotton harvest, farmers in all regions must work hard to eliminate them.
    In controlling pests, we currently advocate combining effective traditional methods with new scientific drugs and equipment, implementing both simultaneously. However, when promoting new scientific drugs, we must consider factors such as efficacy, phytotoxicity, price, supply sources, and potential supply volume. Phytotoxicity, in particular, requires careful attention because even occasional instances of phytotoxicity leading to losses can cause farmers to avoid using new drugs and equipment, affecting the future improvement and promotion of new agricultural science and technology. Old cottonseed oil emulsions are effective in controlling aphids, but due to the likelihood of phytotoxicity, we have not mentioned cottonseed oil emulsions in our past methods for controlling cotton aphids. Recently, Mr. Huang Ruilun and Mr. Han Xilai of the Agricultural College of Peking University have successfully researched and developed a new cottonseed oil emulsion (i.e., safe cottonseed oil agent) through preliminary experiments. It has no phytotoxicity, has low cost, and its aphid-killing efficacy can reach over 92%. This drug can be produced locally, and we hope that all regions will formulate and try it out, and report the results of the trial use to us. If the trial results are good, this drug can be used as much as possible. The previously distributed Derris can then be reserved for controlling other pests. Tobacco water is suitable for tobacco-producing areas and areas with cigarette factories, as it can be produced locally and can utilize waste products such as tobacco stems, tobacco veins, and tobacco soil. Various regions can adapt to local conditions and apply these methods flexibly.

    试用新棉油乳剂
    农业部技术改进处
    蚜虫是历年危害棉苗的大敌，要保证棉产的收获，各地农民必须用力除治。
    在除治害虫上，目前我们主张将有效的土法，和新的科学药械结合起来，兼施并用。但在推广新的科学药剂时，我们必须考虑药效、药害、价格、供给来源以及可能供给量等条件，而药害更得慎重注意，因为即便偶而发生药害招致了损失，都会使得农民忌避使用新的药械，影响今后新的农业科学技术的改进与推广。旧的棉油乳剂，在除蚜上是有效的，但由于容易发生药害，过去我们在除治棉蚜的办法中并未提及棉油乳剂。近经北大农学院黄瑞纶韩熹莱先生研究试制新棉油乳剂（即安全棉油剂），初步试验成功，既无药害，成本又低，而杀蚜效力，可达百分之九十二以上。此药可就地取材，望各地配制试用，并将试用成绩报告我们。如试用成绩良好，可尽量使用此药，前所发下的德利斯，则可留作除治其他害虫之用。烟草水，宜于产烟区及有纸烟工厂之地区，以就地取材，并可利用烟梗、烟筋、烟土等废物。各地可因地制宜，灵活运用。
