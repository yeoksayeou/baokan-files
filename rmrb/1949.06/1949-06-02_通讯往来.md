To comrades, the correspondents in various regions:

　　We hope that you will quickly report on the following issues in the shortest possible time:

　　(1) How are the masses being organized to overcome difficulties and practice frugality to survive the famine? Please report on the achievements and experiences in a timely manner.

　　(2) Has your area made early preparations for this year's flood control work, and how were they prepared? How is the construction of water conservancy projects and the excavation of canals combined with flood control work? How are the masses being organized? What difficulties have been overcome?

　　(3) The summer harvest this year, and the situation of your seed selection.

　　The above three points are just general suggestions. You can write and send articles to this newspaper based on the actual situation in your local area, using specific facts!
