Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, 8th: Tianjin's primary and secondary schools and mass education work have rapidly recovered and developed in the four and a half months since liberation. All 391 public and private primary and secondary schools in the city have reopened, with a total of more than 130,000 students and approximately 5,000 faculty and staff. The Lixing, Minzhu, and Peiying schools, which were run by Kuomintang secret agents, have been disbanded by government order. In the early days of Tianjin's liberation, some schools experienced laxity and indiscipline due to some students misunderstanding the meaning of democracy and freedom. Some teachers also lacked a sense of responsibility or held mercenary ideas, which greatly harmed learning. In light of the specific situation, the educational leadership adopted various methods to mobilize teachers and students in various schools to actively rectify the situation. At present, correct learning viewpoints and a new school spirit and discipline have begun to be established in many schools. Under the leadership of the Municipal Education Bureau, Nankai, No. 1 Middle School, Special No. 1, and Yaohua schools have established school affairs management committees. Political study groups have been established in all schools, and wall newspapers and picture magazines have been published to promote learning. The majority of teachers are actively engaged in learning and are beginning to teach with the idea of serving the people. However, disunity still exists among some school staff members. In addition, the tuition fee issues for some private middle and primary schools have not yet been adequately resolved.

Mass education has also made great progress. A total of 250 remedial schools and literacy classes for workers, citizens, women, and children have been opened in the city, nearly double the 95 before liberation. The number of students is more than 15,000, an increase of two times compared with the more than 5,000 before liberation. Many workers, working-class citizens, and out-of-school children have been given the opportunity to learn. Many students use their spare time to teach literacy classes or implement the "little teacher" system, with very good results. In addition, there are 14 people's cultural centers, 3 stadiums, and 1 library and 1 art gallery, all of which are regularly open.

　　津中小学全部开课
  　新的校风校纪开始建立
    一万五千人进入补校识字班
    【新华社天津八日电】天津市的中小学和群众教育工作，在解放后的四个半月中，已经迅速恢复，并有了发展。全市公私立中、小学学校三百九十一处，已全部开课，学生共达十三万余人，教职员约五千余人。国民党特务所主办的力行、民主、培英等三校，则已由政府明令解散。天津解放初期，有些学校由于不少学生误解民主自由的意义，曾发生散漫无纪律现象，部分教师也缺乏责任感，或抱着雇佣观念，使学习受到很大损失。教育领导机关针对具体情况，采用各种方式，动员各校师生，积极加以整顿，目前在不少学校中，正确的学习观点和新的校风、校纪已经开始树立。南开、一中、特一、耀华等校，在市教育局领导下，已建立了校务管理委员会。各校普遍建立政治学习小组，并出版壁报、画刊等，推动学习。多数教师积极进行学习，开始以为人民服务的观点，进行教学。但目前某些学校教职员中还存在着不团结的现象。另有部分私立中学、小学学费问题还没得到适当解决。
    群众教育亦有很大的发展。全市补习学校及工人、市民、妇女、儿童、识字班等，一共开办了二百五十处，较解放前的九十五处增加将近两倍；学生人数一万五千余人，较解放前的五千多人增加了两倍，很多工人、劳苦市民和失学儿童得到了学习的机会。许多学生，利用课余时间给识字班讲课，或实行小先生制，效果很好。此外还有人民文化馆十四处，体育场三处，图书馆、艺术馆各一处、也都经常开放。
