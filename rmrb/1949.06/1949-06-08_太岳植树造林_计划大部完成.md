　　【Taiyue Telegram】The spring afforestation plans in various parts of the Taiyue region have been largely completed. According to statistics from over 350 administrative villages in thirteen counties including Qinyuan and Yangcheng, approximately 290,000 trees of various types were planted this spring. The tree planting plan along the Baijin Highway has also been largely completed. For example, on the section from Jincheng to the Gaoping boundary, which is fifty *li* long, over 3,000 trees were planted on both sides. This year, the average number of trees planted in the entire region is close to the requirement of two trees per household. The average survival rate of trees planted in various places is above 70 percent. For example, in Yangcheng, out of 10,463 trees planted, 10,347 survived, accounting for 99 percent. The reasons for the success are that various places have resolutely implemented the policy of protecting highway trees, specifically organized and led the efforts to solve the difficulties in tree planting, and created a mass tree planting movement. Secondly, the nurseries of agricultural farms in various counties provided the masses with a large number of saplings. Finally, the tree planting activities of various government agencies, organizations, and schools influenced and promoted the masses. However, in the future, we should strengthen mass forest protection education and truly implement the policy of prohibiting mountain access and protecting forests, and eliminate the phenomenon of indiscriminate logging. For example, a certain match company in Xinjiang sold private mountain forests in Yicheng and entered into a mountain-destroying contract of "leaving the mountain only after all trees are cut down" (which has been corrected) should attract the attention of various places.

　　太岳植树造林　计划大部完成
    【太岳电】太岳各地今春植树造林计划，已大部完成。据沁源、阳城等十三个县三百五十余行政村的统计，今春共植各种树木约二十九万株。白晋公路两旁植树计划，也大部完成。如晋城至高平交界一段，长五十里，两旁即栽树三千余棵。今年全区植树，平均接近了每户两株的要求。各地植树成活率平均都在百分之七十以上，如阳城共栽一万零四百六十三株，活了一万零三百四十七株，占百分之九十九。获得成绩的原因是各地坚决执行了保护公路林木的政策，具体组织领导解决了植树困难，造成群众性的植树运动。其次，各县农场的苗圃，供给了群众不少的树秧，最后是各机关、团体、学校植树影响推动了群众。但今后还应加强群众性的护林教育，确实贯彻禁山护林政策，禁绝乱砍乱伐现象。如新绛某火柴公司，卖翼城私人山林，订立了“树尽留山”的毁山合同（已纠正）应引起各地注意。
