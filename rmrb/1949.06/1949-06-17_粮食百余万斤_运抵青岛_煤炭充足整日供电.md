Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, 16th. The first batch of grain, oil, and coal supplied by the Shandong Trade Company's Jiaodong Branch to Qingdao arrived in Qingdao on the 8th and 9th. This included over 1.4 million jin of grain, over 36,000 jin of edible oil, and over 3,000 tons of coal. Market grain prices have fallen by 15%, and general commodity prices have also fallen by 30%. Due to the ample supply of coal, the Qingdao Power Plant has resumed full-day power supply. Under the rule of the Kuomintang bandit gang, the plant had been forced to ration power or implement emergency power outages for more than half a year due to fuel shortages.

　　粮食百余万斤
    运抵青岛
  　煤炭充足整日供电
    【新华社济南十六日电】山东贸易公司胶东区分公司供应青岛的首批粮、油、煤炭，已于八、九两日先后运抵青岛市。计有粮食一百四十余万斤，食油三万六千余斤，煤炭三千余吨。市场粮价已下跌百分之十五，一般物价亦下跌百分之三十。由于煤炭充足，青岛发电厂已恢复整日全部供电。该厂在国民党匪帮统治时，因燃料缺乏被迫分区停电或紧急停电已逾半年。
