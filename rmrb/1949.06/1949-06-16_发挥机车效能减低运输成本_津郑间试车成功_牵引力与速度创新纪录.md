　　Exerting Locomotive Efficiency to Reduce Transportation Costs
  　Successful Test Run Between Tianjin and Zhengzhou
  　Sets New Records for Traction and Speed
    [Special dispatch from Zhengzhou, 15th of this month] Reporter Ai Fang reports: In order to test the locomotive's traction tonnage and speed, and to gain an in-depth understanding of the situation so as to improve work efficiency and reduce transportation costs, the Ministry of Railways specially dispatched its affiliated bureaus to organize test trains, led by Deputy Director Zhen Tao of the Transportation Bureau and Deputy Director Yuan Zhongfan of the Civil Engineering Bureau. The test train departed from Tianjin North Station at 7:40 AM on the 10th, passing through Jinan and Xuzhou, and victoriously arrived at its designated destination, Zhengzhou, at 9:34 PM on the 13th, taking four days and traveling a total of 1,048 kilometers and 200 meters. The test results broke the highest record of locomotive traction during the enemy-puppet period, and shattered the conservative notion currently held by some people that locomotive traction force could not be further improved.

    The test was conducted in three sections. The locomotives used for the test were all medium-sized locomotives, operated by ordinary crew members.

    Tianjin-Jinan Section
    (1) Tianjin-Jinan Section: 352 kilometers long. The locomotive was a MianKe-1 type, number 1516. The total length of the train reached 574 meters, with a calculated length of 52 units and a traction tonnage of 2135.85 metric tons, translating to a traction conversion of 49.1. This broke the highest record of 45 traction conversion during the enemy-puppet rule, exceeding it by 4.1, and greatly surpassing the general locomotive traction conversion currently in use. The actual running time between Tianjin and Jinan was 11 hours and 15 minutes, with a technical speed of 41.4 kilometers per hour. The speed between Dezhou and Sangzidian, which was restricted to 30 kilometers per hour by the Civil Engineering Bureau of the Ministry of Railways on June 1st of this year, reached 53 kilometers per hour during this test run.

    Jinan-Xuzhou Section
    (2) Jinan-Xuzhou Section (347 kilometers and 200 meters long): The test locomotive was a MianKe-1 type, number 1991. Due to two major slopes between Jinan and Tai'an, the first slope, plus the curve, was equivalent to 0.767, and the second slope was 0.667. Therefore, the traction conversion was changed to 46.1, which still exceeded the traction rating during the enemy-puppet period by 1.1 conversion. The Jinan-Xuzhou section took 17 hours and 27 minutes, with a technical speed of 25.6 kilometers per hour. The speed between Jinan and Lincheng was restricted to 35 kilometers per hour, but the maximum speed of the test train reached 63 kilometers per hour, exceeding the previous speed limit by 28 kilometers.

    Xuzhou-Zhengzhou Section
    (3) Xuzhou-Zhengzhou Section (349 kilometers long): The test locomotive was a MianKe-1 type, number 956. The traction conversion was still changed to 49.1, converting to 2135.85 metric tons. The usual traction weight for locomotives on this section from Xuzhou to Kaifeng is 1250 tons, and from Kaifeng to Zhengzhou the locomotive traction force is 1100 tons. The results of this test, however, exceeded the usual locomotive traction force by nearly double. The travel time for this section was 10 hours and 30 minutes, with a technical speed of 33 kilometers per hour. The maximum speed between Kaifeng and Zhengzhou was 42 kilometers per hour, while the previous speed limit was 35 kilometers per hour.

    The above achievements are due to the extensive efforts of the broad masses of employees in road construction, bridge building, and reinforcement work, which laid the foundation for the railway lines. Secondly, it is also due to the combination of leadership and staff of the test train, and even more so, due to the active efforts of the crew members. However, there are also many shortcomings seen along the way. For example, the regular attention of everyone has not been drawn to track maintenance. According to investigations, more than 70 percent of the rail spikes are loose and the screws are loose; more than 80 percent of the switch points are not wiped clean, some roads have more weeds, and the order at some stations is not good. For example, at Xuzhou Station on the Tianjin-Pukou Railway and Longhai Railway lines, the phenomena of chaotic boarding and crowding are serious. According to statistics from the Kaifeng section of the Zhengzhou Railway Bureau, there were as many as eight train damage incidents in this section in May. All of the above should arouse high vigilance and urgently need to be improved.

    Note: 1. Technical speed: the average running speed per hour of the train from the departure station to the terminal station, excluding the stopover time during the journey, is the technical speed.
    2. Calculated length: The length of the train is calculated as one unit for every 11 meters.
    3. Traction conversion: that is, every 43.5 metric tons of traction is converted into one unit.

### 发挥机车效能减低运输成本　津郑间试车成功　牵引力与速度创新纪录

　　发挥机车效能减低运输成本
  　津郑间试车成功
  　牵引力与速度创新纪录
    【本报郑州十五日专电】记者艾方报道：铁道部为试验机车牵引定数、速度，深入了解情况，以便提高工作效能，减低运输成本，特派所属各局，组织试验列车，由运输局副局长甄陶、工务局副局长袁仲凡领导。该试验列车于十日上午七时四十分驶出天津北站，经济南，徐州，于十三日午后九时三十四分胜利到达预定之终点郑州，历时四日，行驶全长一千零四十八公里又二百米。试验结果，突破了敌伪时期机车牵引的最高纪录，打破了目前部分人员中认为机车牵引力不可能再提高的保守观念。
    试验共分三段进行，担任试验的机车都是中等机车，由一般的乘务员操纵。
    津济段
    （一）津济段：长三百五十二公里，机车为冂ㄎ一型一五一六号，列车全长达五七四米，计算长度五二个，牵引吨数为二一三五·八五公吨，牵引换算四九·一，突破了敌伪统治时期牵引换算四十五的最高纪录，较前超出四·一，更大大的突破了现在一般的机车牵引换算。津济间实际运行时间为十一时十五分，每小时技术速度为四一·四公里，其中德县、桑梓店间，铁道部工务局于今年六月一日限制速度为三十公里，这次试车速度为五十三公里。
    济徐段
    （二）济徐段（长三百四十七公里零二百米）试验机车为冂ㄎ一型一九九一号，由于济南到泰安间有两处较大的坡道，第一个坡度加上湾度，换算为○·七六七，第二个坡度为○·六六七，因之牵引换算改为四六·一，仍较敌伪时期牵引定数超出一·一换算。济徐段运行时间为十七时二十七分，技术速度每时二五·六公里，其中济南至临城段限制速度为三十五公里，但试验列车最高速度即达六十三公里，超出前限制逮度二十八公里。
    徐郑段
    （三）徐郑段（长三百四十九公里）试验机车为冂ㄎ一型九五六号。牵引换算仍改为四九·一，换算计二一三五·八五公吨。该段机车通常牵引重量自徐州至开封为一千二百五十吨，自开封至郑州机车牵引力为一千一百吨，此次试验结果，则超过通常行车机车牵引力将近一倍。该段行车时间为十时三十分，技术速度为三十三公里，开封郑州间每小时最高速度为四十二公里，过去限制速度为三十五公里。
    以上成绩是由于广大员工修路建桥及补强工作，使线路有了基础，其次也由于试验列车同志的上下结合，更由于乘务员的积极努力所获得。但是就沿途所见也有很多缺点，如在养路方面未能引起大家的经常注意，据查有百分之七十以上的道钉浮起，螺丝活动；百分之八十以上的道岔子未擦，有的路上杂草较多，站上秩序有的不好，如津浦线陇海线的徐州车站，乱上车和拥挤现象严重，据郑州局开封段的统计，五月份该段车伤事件达八起之多。以上都是应引起高度警惕与急待改进的。
    注：１、技术速度，为列车由发站到终站除去途中停站时分平均每小时运行速度即为技术速度。
    ２、计算长度，列车长度以每十一公尺为计算一辆。
    ３、牵引换算，即每牵引四三·五公吨为换算一辆。
