　　North China Financial and Economic Committee Dispatches Three Groups to Investigate Urban-Rural Trade and Other Situations
    [This newspaper reports] In order to develop production and promote the exchange of goods between urban and rural areas, the North China Financial and Economic Committee has decided to organize three groups—taxation, urban-rural trade investigation and research, and export trade—to understand the difficulties existing in the exchange of goods and foreign trade. The taxation group is responsible for investigating and researching tax cards, types of taxes, tax amounts, tax rates, deviations in tax collection, and procedures in the process of goods exchange. This group will begin investigating tax collection at various city and town tax posts today (the 18th), study collection conditions, and solicit opinions on various taxes from farmers, major industries, and representatives of industrial exhibition delegations at farmer reception centers. The urban-rural trade group is further divided into four subgroups: grain, cotton cloth, fur, and local products. The group has set out a half-month investigation plan and began investigating yesterday (the 17th). The export trade group will investigate export commodities, export standards, and problems existing from production to export. This group is scheduled to begin its investigation today (the 18th).
