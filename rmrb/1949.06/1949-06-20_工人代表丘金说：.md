Worker Representative Qiu Jin Speaks:

　　Participating in the preparatory meeting for the New Political Consultative Conference this time has evoked many feelings in me. I worked on ships of American-owned companies like Dodwell & Co., British-owned companies like Chang Hing Co., etc., for more than ten years, and suffered greatly from the exploitation, oppression, and humiliation of imperialism and capitalists.

　　Because the oppression and exploitation were unbearable, the seamen workers had launched many resistance struggles. The Hong Kong Seamen's Strike in 1922 and the Hong Kong strike after the May Thirtieth Movement were the largest in scale. From the struggles, I realized that our suffering was not a matter of the fate of us "boatmen," but a matter of the entire social and political system of China. It made us realize that to get rid of our suffering, we must be determined, unite as one, overthrow the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang comprador bourgeoisie (then called comprador bourgeoisie) and the feudal class, eliminate the forces of imperialism invading China, and establish a new regime and a new society representing the interests of the working class and all the people. From the struggle, we also realized that only the Chinese Communist Party can lead us workers in such a resolute and thorough revolutionary cause. Therefore, since 1930, after myself and many friends found the Communist Party, we have sincerely listened to its leadership and carried out revolutionary work. For this work, many of us were arrested and imprisoned, subjected to cruel torture, and some bravely sacrificed themselves, but we did not yield. We only had one belief, one determination, that is, if the Kuomintang's counter-revolutionary rule is not overthrown and the revolution is not successful, the struggle cannot cease.

　　More than twenty years have passed, and the Chinese people's revolutionary struggle, under the wise leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, the heroic fighting of the People's Liberation Army, and the full support of the broad masses of the people, is about to achieve complete victory across the country. Seamen workers, like the entire working class, are respected as the leading class in the liberated areas in terms of political and social status. Today, the preparatory meeting for the New Political Consultative Conference is being held under such circumstances, and I am able to attend this conference as one of the representatives of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, which makes me so excited and happy that I can't express it in words.

　　Indeed, the Communist Party is truly the party of our working class, truly a party representing the interests of the people of the whole country, and Chairman Mao is the great leader of our workers and the people of the whole country. Only our party and our leader can know the depths of the suffering of us workers and the broad masses of the people, and think of ways to relieve our suffering, lead us to fight to relieve such suffering, and make the struggle a victory. And only our party, only our leader, can, after leading us to revolutionary victory, hand over such important national affairs to the representatives of our workers and the representatives of the people of all democratic classes to discuss and let us come up with ideas to build our own country.

　　Now the preparatory meeting of the New Political Consultative Conference is in session, and the people of the whole country and the working class of the whole country are looking forward to us quickly discussing the major national plans, coming up with regulations, producing a new central government, and managing national affairs well. Eliminate the remnants of the counter-revolutionary forces and build a free, democratic, prosperous, and strong New China. Tens of millions of workers are looking forward to the representatives of our All-China Federation of Trade Unions and supporting us in putting forward good ideas at the meeting so that we workers can gradually alleviate the suffering left by the enemy's destruction and oppression in the construction of the New China.

　　Today, the revolution is about to be victorious, but the poverty and disasters left to the people by the enemy's rule and their destruction and sabotage of national construction in the battles are very deep. To heal these wounds and relieve the people of these difficulties still requires great hard work. Here, the responsibility entrusted to the representatives of the New Political Consultative Conference is very heavy. I think every representative participating in the meeting is conscientious. I wish everyone a smooth completion of the glorious and great task under the wise leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao.

　　工人代表丘金说：
    这次参加新政协筹备会，引起我很多感想。我曾在美国的大来公司，英国的昌兴公司……等轮船上作工十多年，备受帝国主义、资本家剥削、压迫和凌辱。
    由于压迫与剥削无法忍受，海员工人曾进行过很多的反抗斗争。一九二二年的香港海员大罢工，五卅后香港罢工等，是规模最大的。从斗争中使我认识到我们的痛苦不是什么“行船仔”的这一行人的命运问题，而是中国整个社会制度与政治制度的问题。使我们认识到要解除我们的痛苦，必须下决心，团结一致，把国民党买办资产阶级（当时叫买办资产阶级）与封建阶级的反动统治推翻，把帝国主义侵入中国的势力扫除，建立起代表工人阶级及全体人民利益的新的政权与新的社会才能办到。从斗争中又使我们认识到，能够领导我们工人进行这样坚决彻底的革命事业的，只有中国共产党。所以从一九三○年，自我和许多朋友找到共产党以后，就诚心诚意的听从它的领导，进行革命工作，为了这种工作，我们中不少的人曾被捕入狱，遭受残酷严刑拷打，有的英勇牺牲了，但我们没有屈服，我们只有一个信念，一个决心，就是国民党的反革命统治不推翻，革命不成功，斗争就不能休止。
    时光过了二十多年了，中国人民革命斗争，在共产党、在毛主席的英明领导、解放军的英勇作战与广大人民的全力支持之下，快要在全国完全胜利了。海员工人与整个工人阶级一样，在解放区的政治地位、社会地位被尊为领导阶级。今天是在这样情况下来开这个新政协筹备会，而我竟能作为全国总工会代表之一出席这个大会，真使我兴奋得愉快得说不出话来。
    的确，共产党真是我们工人阶级的政党，真是代表全国人民利益的政党，而毛主席则是我们工人和全国人民的伟大领袖。只有我们的党，我们的领袖，才能知道我们工人和广大人民痛苦的深处，并为我们想出解除痛苦的道路，领导着我们为解除这样痛苦而斗争，使斗争取得胜利。也只有我们的党，只有我们的领袖才能于领导我们革命胜利之后，又把这样国家大事，交给我们工人的代表和各民主阶级人民的代表来商量讨论，让我们自己出主意来建设自已的国家。
    现在新政协筹备会在开会，全国人民、全国的工人阶级，都在盼望着我们很快的把国家大计商量好，拿出章程产生出新的中央政府把国家大事办好。把反革命的残余势力肃清，建设一个自由民主富强的新中国。几千万的工人都在盼望着我们全国总工会的代表，并拥护我们能在会上提出好主意，使我们工人能在新中国建设中慢慢解除敌人摧残压迫所留下来的痛苦。
    今天革命是快要胜利了，敌人统治时期留下给人民的贫穷与灾难及他们在战斗中对国家建设的摧残与破坏是很深重的，要治好这些创伤，解除人民这些困难还须很大的艰苦工作，这里委托于新政协的代表们的责任是很重大的。我想参加会议的每一代表大家都是兢兢业业的。我预祝大家在共产党与毛主席的英明领导下，很顺利地完成光荣而伟大的任务。
