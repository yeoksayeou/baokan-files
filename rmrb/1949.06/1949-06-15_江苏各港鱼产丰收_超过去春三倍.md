Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, June 14th: With the assistance of the People's Government, fishermen in Jiangsu Province's well-known fishing ports – ＠ Port and Nan Port under the jurisdiction of Dongtai County, and Yanwei Port under the jurisdiction of Guanyun County – have achieved bumper fish harvests this spring. A total of 156 fishing boats from ＠ Port and Nan Port set sail during the first and second fishing seasons, catching a total of 4,964,000 catties of fish, averaging over 63,400 catties per boat, exceeding last spring's output by three times. Fishermen at Yanwei Port also caught over 60,000 catties of fish and over 2,000 catties of small shrimp during the first fishing season. Fishermen at ＠ Port and Nan Port experienced reduced production during the first fishing season due to disturbances by Kuomintang bandits. However, with the protection of the People's Naval Defense Forces during the second fishing season, production increased by approximately 40 percent. After the bumper harvests, fishermen from all ports have been actively repaying their loans. The fishermen from the aforementioned three ports received loans from the People's Government totaling over one million RMB and nearly 400 shi of salt, most of which has now been repaid.
