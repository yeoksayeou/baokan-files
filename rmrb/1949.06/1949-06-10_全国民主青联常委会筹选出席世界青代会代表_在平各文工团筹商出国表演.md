　　[Report from this newspaper] The Standing Committee of the All-China Democratic Youth Federation held its first meeting yesterday (the 9th), to discuss preparations, in conjunction with the New Democratic Youth League and the All-China Students' Federation, for selecting delegates to attend the Second World Youth Congress and the International Youth Day in August. Liao Chengzhi, Chen Jiakang, Qian Sanqiang, Sa Kongliao, and Wu Xue were selected to be responsible for the preparations. Comrade Liao Chengzhi's report at the Youth Congress was ratified, and a secretariat was established to handle daily work. Wu Han was elected Secretary-General, and Chen Jiakang and Li Geng were elected Deputy Secretaries-General. (Jin Feng)
　　[Report from this newspaper] The Central Committee of the China New Democratic Youth League and the Beiping Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party yesterday (the 9th) convened ten performing arts troupes in Beiping, including the First, Second, and Third Performing Arts Troupes of China University, the Youth Theater, the People's Performing Arts Troupe, the Anti-Enemy Drama Society, and the Combat Drama Troupe, to discuss matters relating to participating in the International Youth Day in August to perform literary and dramatic programs abroad. Comrades Liao Chengzhi and Chen Jiakang explained successively that, due to the improvement of China's international status, international friends are eager to understand the appearance of the new China growing in battle. There is a "China Day" in the International Youth Day Congress, dedicated to introducing China. Therefore, it is hoped that the Chinese youth delegation attending this time will include a group of sixty or seventy cultural, dramatic, and musical workers, so as to be able to perform some programs to introduce the newly born China to the world. After a full exchange of views at the meeting, it was initially believed that new and old programs that can represent the national character should be introduced, such as Yangko opera, dance, Chinese-style orchestral music, Peking opera, and other folk arts. Liao Chengzhi, Chen Jiakang, Li Bozhao, Shu Qiang, Ding Li, and others were elected on the spot as thirteen preparatory committee members, responsible for preparing programs and selecting actors.

    【本报讯】中国新民主主义青年团中央委员会与中共北平市文委会昨（九日）召集在平的华大第一、第二、第三文工团，青年剧院，人民文工团，抗敌剧社，战斗剧团等十个文工团，筹商今年八月出国参加国际青年节表演文艺戏剧节目事宜。廖承志、陈家康同志先后说明：由于中国国际地位的提高，国际友人都渴望了解新中国在战斗中成长的面貌。国际青年节大会中有一个中国日，专为介绍中国。因此，这次出席的中国青年代表团中，希望能包括六七十人的文化戏剧音乐工作者的团体，以便能表演一些节目，向全世界介绍一下新生的中国。会上经充分交换意见后，初步认为应介绍能代表民族性的新旧节目，如秧歌剧、舞蹈、中国式的管弦乐、平剧及其他民间艺术。并当场推选廖承志、陈家康、李伯钊、舒强、丁里等十三人为筹备委员，负责筹备节目及演员人选等工作。（金凤）
