Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, 15th - Tianjin's state-owned enterprise staff and workers have gradually eliminated barriers between them after studying the issue of worker unity and conducting criticism and self-criticism. They have begun to demonstrate an unprecedented spirit of solidarity in work, life, and study. Many staff members and engineers have begun to study work and improve technology with workers. At the Tianjin Steel Plant, staff and workers in the distribution room jointly researched and developed the use of waste materials to formulate high-voltage switches, replacing high-voltage magnetic bottles, which made the technicians realize the value of the workers' experience. Before the open-hearth furnace was started, all furnace technicians and workers collectively discussed and formulated the steelmaking work rules. Engineers, technical personnel, and worker representatives of China Textile Factory No. 5 established a system of holding weekly production review meetings, helping each other in work and correcting mistakes. After a staff member of China Textile Factory No. 7 transferred to Factory No. 2, he carefully helped the workers technically. When a worker was sick, he personally went to the hospital to get medicine, and sometimes even helped the worker with work, so he was unanimously praised by the workers. In terms of study, some factories have established workers' spare-time study classes, where staff members teach culture and technology classes. At the same time, employees have also begun to sing and play ball together in their spare time, and the old boundaries in life have gradually been eliminated.

After the liberation of Tianjin, the public enterprises had educated or appropriately punished individual staff and foremen who had colluded with reactionary forces to oppress workers in the past, according to the severity of their crimes. However, many staff members still maintained a bureaucratic style, looked down on workers; some staff members were also apprehensive and dared not command workers, which caused some workers to have an ultra-democratic tendency, which had an adverse impact on production. In late April, after Comrade Liu Shaoqi arrived in Tianjin, he gave instructions on strengthening worker unity, and he made it clear that the staff in the state-owned enterprise organs are part of the working class and are state cadres; the workers should consciously unite them. However, staff members must correct the wrong view of despising labor and workers brought about by the old society in the past, conduct self-criticism, admit past mistakes to the workers, and transform themselves. Following Comrade Shaoqi's instructions, the employees of various state-owned factories in Tianjin successively launched studies and discussions. In early May, employees of various units under the Tianjin Telecommunications Bureau, Tianjin Enterprise Company Machine Factory, Electrical Equipment Factory, and China Vegetable Oil Factory successively established learning organizations to study Comrade Shaoqi's instructions and other relevant documents. Tianjin Steel Plant employees also conducted discussions on worker unity issues during daily work rest time under the leadership of the employee representative meeting. After learning, some factories, such as China Textile Factory No. 3, Tianjin Steel Plant, and Trolley Management Office, carried out criticism and self-criticism through employee gatherings and employee solidarity meetings.

Because of a period of study and discussion, the attitudes of both staff and workers were very sincere during the criticism, and those who were criticized were generally able to accept it with an open mind. Wang Deshan, the driver chief of the Transportation Section of the Trolley Management Office, frankly stated the facts of corruption and bribery before liberation at the solidarity meeting, and narrated his transformation process, asking for everyone's forgiveness. The workers expressed that they would not investigate the past and encouraged him for his serious inspection of vehicles after liberation, approaching the workers, and patiently explaining the problems to everyone. At the same time, some workers also reviewed their shortcomings in not listening to the staff's command in their work, and were determined to care for each other, learn from each other, and do a good job in production in the future.

In carrying out criticism and self-criticism, in some factories, because the prior education and explanation were not in-depth enough, the criticism and self-criticism became a formality, so many people in the staff still had scruples about face, afraid of offending people, and unwilling to frankly admit their mistakes in public. Many factories have not even started criticism and self-criticism. According to the experience of China Textile Factory No. 3 and Tianjin Steel Plant, the following points should be paid attention to when carrying out the above work: (1) Conduct in-depth education and brewing in advance to break ideological concerns; (2) Responsible personnel take the lead by example and conduct their own self-criticism first; (3) Cultivate activists among workers to play a leading role; (4) Criticism is best carried out in a chatty manner so that everyone can speak freely; (5) When criticizing a worker's shortcomings, do not obliterate their advantages at the same time, so that praise and criticism are combined.

### 加强学习开展批评检讨　天津公营企业职工　消除隔阂共谋增产

　　加强学习开展批评检讨
  　天津公营企业职工
  　消除隔阂共谋增产
    【新华社天津十五日电】天津市公营企业的职员与工人，在进行了对职工团结问题的学习与开展了批评与自我批评以后，职工间的隔阂逐渐消除，在工作、生活、学习等方面已开始表现出前所未有的团结精神。许多职员与工程师开始和工人共同研究工作，改进技术。在天津炼钢厂，配电室的职员与工人共同研究出利用废料配制高压电闸，代替高压磁瓶，这使技师们认识到工人们的经验的可贵。该厂马丁炉开炉前，曾由全炉技师和工人集体讨论，制定了炼钢的工作规则。中纺五厂的工程师、技术人员和职工代表建立了每周召开生产检讨会的制度，在工作中互相帮助，改正错误。中纺七厂某职员调到二厂工作后，细心地在技术上帮助工人，工人病了，他亲自到医院取药，有时还帮助工人工作，因此受到工人们一致的赞扬。在学习上，有些厂成立了工人业余学习班，由职员上文化课和技术课。同时职工在业余也开始常在一起唱歌打球，生活上逐渐消除了旧时的界限。
    天津解放后，各公营企业曾对过去勾结反动势力欺压工人的个别职员和工头，根据其罪恶轻重，分别予以教育或适当处分。但不少职员依然保有官僚主义作风，瞧不起工人；也有一些职员则存有疑虑，不敢指挥工人，以致有些工人产生了极端民主化的偏向，使生产受到不良影响。四月下旬刘少奇同志到天津后，曾对加强职工团结问题有所指示，他明确指出公营企业机关中的职员是工人阶级的一部分，是国家的干部；工人应该自觉地去团结他们。但职员必须改正过去旧社会带来的轻视劳动轻视工人的错误观点，进行自我批评，向工人承认过去的错误，改造自己。在少奇同志这一指示之后，天津各公营工厂职工即相继展开了学习与讨论。五月初，天津市电信局所属各单位、天津市企业公司机器厂、电工器材厂及中国植物油料厂等单位职工，都先后建立了学习组织，学习少奇同志的指示及其他有关文件。天津炼钢厂职工亦在职工代表会领导下，利用每日工余时间，进行了有关职工团结问题的讨论。经过学习，有些工厂如中纺三厂、天津炼钢厂、电车管理处等单位即通过职工联欢会、职工团结会等形式，展开了批评与自我批评。
    由于经过一段学习讨论，所以批评时职员和工人双方的态度都很诚恳，被批评者一般也能虚心接受。电车管理处车务科司机长王德山，在团结会上曾坦白说出解放前贪污受贿的事实，并叙述了自己转变的过程，请求大家原谅。工人们表示既往不究，并对他在解放后认真检查车辆、接近工人、耐心向大家解释问题，多所勉励。同时，有些工人也检讨了自己在工作中不听职员指挥的缺点，决心今后互相关心、互相学习，把生产做好。
    在开展批评与自我批评中，有些厂因事先的教育解释尚不深入，使批评与自我批评流于形式，因而职工中仍有不少人顾虑情面，怕得罪人，不愿当众坦白承认自己的错误等。而不少工厂甚至还没有开展批评与自我批评。根据中纺三厂及天津炼钢厂的经验，开展上述工作，须注意下列几点：（一）事先进行深入的教育与酝酿，打破思想顾虑；（二）负责人员以身作则，自己先进行检讨；（三）培养工人中的积极分子，起带头作用；（四）批评最好以漫谈方式进行，使大家能畅所欲言；（五）批评一个工人缺点时，同时不抹煞其优点，使表扬与批评结合。
