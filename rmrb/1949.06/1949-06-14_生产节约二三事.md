In implementing the North China Bureau's editorial on drought resistance, production, economy, and famine preparedness, the Taihang Xinhua Daily believes that the widespread launch of economy and famine preparedness work is still lacking in the Taihang region. It is necessary to carry out propaganda and mobilization from top to bottom, help the masses formulate economy and famine preparedness plans, and especially encourage women to learn to save and economize in their daily family life and manage household affairs. Rural cooperative credit departments should promote Zhang Xigui's method of "deposit real, lend real, repay real" in Wu'an. All localities should find ways to establish charitable granaries. Party and government leading organs, factories, schools, and troops at all levels should take the lead in setting an example, practice strict economy, reduce food rations, accurately calculate, and eliminate all waste, so as to truly achieve the promotion and leadership of the mass economy movement from top to bottom.

Weeding and hoeing, ensuring that not an acre of land is left uncultivated, is currently the focus of agricultural production. If weeding and hoeing are not done well, the autumn harvest will be in vain. The Jidong Administrative Office calls on the masses to organize small, temporary forms of labor mutual aid, organize all labor, especially organize women to come to the production front, which is very important. Leading organs at all levels should attach great importance to checking weeding and hoeing work. The Taihang Production Inspection Group, the Jidong Wasteland Investigation Team, and cadres sent to the countryside by various organs should go deep into each village and household to study and find ways to solve the various difficulties of the peasants, inspect leadership, and inspect the situation of substitute cultivation. During the inspection, attention should also be paid to mobilizing the masses to produce and provide disaster relief. Many areas have suffered disasters this year, and the weeding and hoeing stage of production is also a time when the old grain is running out and the new grain is not yet available. It is necessary to organize the masses to participate in various productions, earn food rations, and make up for the shortfall, so that the peasants can concentrate on weeding and hoeing to ensure increased production.

Our cadres do not have a sufficient understanding of the nature and role of mutual aid, and often waver between the two deviations of laissez-faireism and formalism. The mutual aid group is an economic organization of collective labor based on individual economy. Its main role is to save labor, exchange experience, and improve technology, so as to develop and improve mass production. However, our cadres often want to carry out political, administrative, cultural and other work through the mutual aid group, and call this practice "improvement," which will inevitably be opposed by the masses. All practical workers must, in accordance with the nature and role of the above-mentioned mutual aid labor exchange organization, truly change this shortcoming, so as to universally carry out the mutual aid labor exchange movement in the future based on the basic principles of mass voluntariness and equivalence.

　　生产节约二三事
    太行新华日报在贯彻华北局抗旱生产节约备荒社论中认为：普遍开展节约备荒这一工作，在太行全区发动的尚差，必须自上而下的宣传动员，帮助群众制定节约备荒计划，特别是提倡妇女在家庭日常生活中学会省吃俭用，经管家务。农村合作社信用部应推广武安张喜贵存实贷实还实的办法。各地应设法兴办义仓。各级党政领导机关、工厂、学校、部队，更应首起模范，厉行节约，省减口粮，精确核算，消灭一切浪费现象，以便真正做到自上而下推动与领导群众的节约运动。

    清苗锄草，保证不荒一亩地，是目前农业生产重心，锄苗作不好，秋收便落空，冀东行署号召群众组织小型的、临时性的各种劳动互助形式，组织一切劳力，特别是组织妇女们到生产战线上来，是很重要的。各级领导机关应十分重视检查锄苗工作，太行生产检查团，冀东的查荒工作队以及各机关派下乡的干部都应深入一村一户研究和设法解决农民各种困难，检查领导，检查代耕情形。在检查中还应注意发动群众生产救灾，今年许多地区遭受灾害，而在锄苗这一生产阶段又正是青黄不接的时候，一定要组织群众参加各种生产，赚回口粮，弥补不足，使农民安心锄苗保证增产。

    我们干部对互助的性质与作用认识不够，常常在自流主义与形式主义的两种偏向中左右摇摆。互助组是在个体经济基础上集体劳动的经济组织，它的主要作用在于节省劳力，交流经验，提高技术，以发展和提高群众生产。但我们干部常想把政治、行政、文化等工作都通过互助组去进行，并把这种做法叫做“提高”，结果必然遭到群众的反对。一切实际工作者，必须根据上述互助组织变工的性质与作用，确实改掉这一缺点，以便今后根据群众自愿与等价的基本原则，普遍开展互助变工运动。
