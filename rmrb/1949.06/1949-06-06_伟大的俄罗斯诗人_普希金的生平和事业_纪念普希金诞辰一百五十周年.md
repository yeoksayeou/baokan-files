　　The Great Russian Poet
  　The Life and Work of Pushkin
    Commemorating the 150th Anniversary of Pushkin's Birth
    Ge Baoquan
    In the history of Russian literature, Pushkin will always be a most glorious name. People often call him "the pride of the Russian nation" and "the sun of Russian poetry." His contribution to Russian literature and world literature is immense. As the Central Executive Committee of the Soviet Union stated in its 1935 resolution on organizing the All-Union Pushkin Commemorative Committee, Pushkin was a "great Russian poet," the "creator of the Russian literary language and the founder of new Russian literature," saying that "he enriched all mankind with his immortal artistic works." This can be said to be the most accurate evaluation of Pushkin. Speaking of his immortal artistic works, they also had a great influence on the education of future generations. For example, the famous Russian revolutionary thinker Herzen wrote in "Notes of a Young Man": "The great Pushkin is our literary movement's guiding star; every line of his poetry is passed from one person to another; printed copies are 'not enough to supply,' and handwritten copies are spreading everywhere..." Herzen also tells us that Pushkin's poetic muse "is not a pale, bloodless person," but "a passionate woman, crowned with a halo of health." We can find the best proof of this in all his works.
    This year, June 6th, is the 150th anniversary of the birth of the great poet Pushkin. Grand celebrations are being held throughout the Soviet Union, and the literary and art circles in Peiping are also holding a commemorative event. Therefore, I would like to take this opportunity to introduce Pushkin's life and career here:
    Pushkin was born on June 6, 1799, in Moscow, to a noble family. His father was a landowner from an old noble family, and his mother was the granddaughter of Hannibal, "Peter the Great's black slave." Therefore, Pushkin's character and appearance bore many traces of his ancestor. In his childhood, like all aristocratic children of the time, he grew up under the care of French tutors. He received a French education, and his French was far more fluent than his Russian. He was not very diligent in his studies and was quite lazy, but he was naturally very intelligent. He often sneaked into his father's library, devoured books, and spent hours there. In 1811, when he was twelve years old, a middle school was established in Tsarskoye Selo near St. Petersburg, specifically for children of the nobility, and Pushkin was sent there to study. He began to write poetry in middle school. In July 1814, his poem "To a Poet Friend" was published in the "European Herald." The following January, when the school held a promotion examination, Pushkin publicly recited his poem "Memories of Tsarskoye Selo," which was highly praised by the great poet Derzhavin. Derzhavin, with tears in his eyes, rushed out to kiss him, but the shy and at a loss Pushkin had already run away, so he said: "This is the person who will succeed Derzhavin!" This prediction was not wrong. Later, Pushkin's fame not only surpassed Derzhavin but also made him the creator of the Russian literary language and the founder of new Russian literature.
    Pushkin graduated from Tsarskoye Selo Middle School in June 1817 and was immediately assigned to work in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs with the qualification of a tenth-rank civil servant. At that time, this service was only a nominal title, and his interest was entirely in poetry. At this time, he wrote his first long poem, "Ruslan and Ludmila," and also wrote many poems full of revolutionary passion. Pushkin had been influenced by liberal ideas in middle school. In particular, an officer named Chaadayev in the Guards Cavalry Regiment stationed in Tsarskoye Selo gave him a deep influence. Therefore, some people say that what he got from Chaadayev at that time was more than what he got in the entire middle school era. After graduating from middle school, Pushkin wrote an "Ode to Freedom," as well as "The Village" and "To Chaadayev," etc. These poems revealed revolutionary ideas against the tyranny of the Tsar. Needless to say, these revolutionary poems immediately attracted the attention of the Tsarist authorities. In May 1820, the twenty-one-year-old Pushkin was exiled by Tsar Alexander I to southern Russia.
    The period of his residence in the south was precisely the time when the revolutionary movement spread in Western Europe. Pushkin yearned for these revolutionary movements and even wanted to escape abroad. At the same time, he also had contact with many members of the secret revolutionary organizations in the south. As a result, in July 1824, he was expelled from Odessa for writing poems such as "The Dagger," which advocated the assassination of the Tsar, and was escorted by military police to his parents' estate, Mikhailovskoye, to be placed under house arrest. During this time, Pushkin spent two years in solitude and loneliness, except for writing. It was during this period that the Decembrists launched an uprising in St. Petersburg on December 14, 1825, against the Tsar's autocracy. Many of Pushkin's friends participated. Unfortunately, the uprising was eventually suppressed by the Tsarist authorities. Five responsible leaders were sentenced to hanging, and more than 100 others were exiled to Siberia to do hard labor. Pushkin was spared because he was under house arrest in the countryside. Later, when the new Tsar Nicholas I summoned Pushkin, he asked him: "Pushkin, if you were in St. Petersburg, would you have participated in the uprising of December 14th?" Pushkin boldly replied: "Certainly, Your Majesty." From this point alone, we can see Pushkin's spirit of resistance and firm attitude.
    Although Pushkin was pardoned by the new Tsar at this time, in reality, he was captured by the court and became a prisoner of the court. First, his every move was monitored by the "Third Section," the Tsar's court's secret service organization. Second, all of his works had to be personally reviewed by the Tsar before they could be printed. Third, the Tsar took a fancy to his newlywed beautiful wife. In 1834, the Tsar appointed him as a court chamberlain, making it possible for his wife to frequently enter and leave the court and attend court balls, thereby humiliating Pushkin's status. At this time, a French officer named D'Anthès came to St. Petersburg and also pursued his wife. Many of his enemies wrote anonymous letters to him, defaming him. All of this forced Pushkin to be unable to tolerate it any longer. Finally, he and D'Anthès had a duel on the afternoon of February 8, 1837. Pushkin was seriously injured and died on February 10th at 2:45 pm. The Tsar secretly ordered the military police to secretly transport his coffin to the Holy Mountain town near his former residence, Mikhailovskoye, for burial. At that time, a professor's wife saw this coffin wrapped in straw mats at a certain post station and asked a watchman standing next to it what was going on. The reply was: "God knows what's going on. I heard that someone named Pushkin was beaten to death, and they wrapped him in straw and mats and rushed along the post station - may God forgive me, like dragging a dead dog."
    Pushkin was only thirty-seven years old when he died, the prime of his life! But in those short two or three decades, he had left countless precious legacies. During his lifetime, he wrote nearly eight hundred poems, more than a dozen long poems, five narrative poems, a historical drama "Boris Godunov" and several short tragedies, some short stories and a novel "The Captain's Daughter," as well as some historical works and critical essays. Although Pushkin's writing was multifaceted, he was mainly a poet. Therefore, when he died, a newspaper wrote: "The sun of our poetry has fallen." This sentence is not an exaggeration. Pushkin's death, needless to say, aroused public outrage at the time. Everyone knew that he had become a victim of the Tsar's tyranny. Therefore, a young poet named Lermontov wrote a poem "Death of the Poet," pointing out the group of murderers who killed Pushkin:
    "You, the greedy crowd standing around the throne, are all executioners of freedom, genius, and glory!"
    More than 110 years have passed since Pushkin's death. The Tsarist regime that killed the poet Pushkin has long been overthrown. Today, few people will remember those tyrannical Tsars, but everyone often remembers Pushkin's name. His works are also being reprinted in large quantities and translated into various languages. His name shines gloriously forever. To use the words he once predicted in the poem "To Chaadayev," then
    "On the ruins of autocratic tyranny, his name has long been written."
    This year, June 6th, is his 150th anniversary. On this anniversary, we may as well talk about the poem he wrote entitled "Exegi Monumentum," because this poem summarizes his entire life journey and also shows his strong and unyielding will and lofty spirit. The full text of this poem is as follows:
    I have erected a monument to myself
    Not made by human hands,
    The path to which people walk
    Grass will no longer grow,
    It raises that unyielding
    head
    Towering above Alexander's
    Memorial column.
　
    No, I will not completely
    die – my soul in sacred
    poetry,
    Will live longer than my
    ashes, and escape decay
    and death, –
    I will be forever glorious, even
    if only one poet
    Lives in the world under
    the moonlight.
    My fame will spread throughout
    the entire great Russia,
    All the languages that exist
    will speak my name,
    Whether it be the proud
    descendants of the Slavs, the Finns,
    As well as the still barbarous
    Tungus, and the friend of the
    steppes – the Kalmyks.
　
    I can always be close
    to the people,
    Because I have used my
    poetry to arouse the
    kindness of people, in this
    cruel century, I have
    sung of freedom,
    And for those who have fallen,
    I have begged for pity and
    sympathy.
　
    "O, poetic muse,
    Obey the will of God,
    That is, do not fear humiliation,
    Nor seek laurels,
    Praise and slander, both
    tolerate calmly,
    And do not argue vainly
    with fools."
    Pushkin's poem was written a few months before his death, and the poem is marked "August 21, 1836, on Stone Island." The first section writes of his indomitable spirit. Why did he compare his monument with Alexander's memorial column? I have already said that Pushkin was exiled to southern Russia by Tsar Alexander I, so he always harbored hatred for this Tsar. In 1832, the Tsarist government built a 37-meter-high memorial column on the Winter Palace Square in St. Petersburg to commemorate Alexander I. When the unveiling ceremony was held, Pushkin temporarily left St. Petersburg to show his contempt for the memorial column because he did not want to participate. What he said here, that "monument not made by human hands" that he built, "raises that unyielding head, towering above Alexander's memorial column," is also an expression of this spirit of not bowing his head. The second, fourth, and fifth sections all write about the poet's mission and integrity. He "neither fears humiliation nor seeks laurels." He will always sing for the people, which is why he "can always be close to the people." As he said in the poem "The Prophet," the poet must "use language to ignite people's hearts." The third section of the poem writes about the poet's aspirations, hoping that his name will spread throughout Russia. In fact, Pushkin's name has already spread throughout Russia. From 1888 to 1917, his works were printed in fourteen languages, totaling 10,711,000 copies; from 1918 to 1947, they were printed in seventy-six languages, totaling 35,429,000 copies. These seventy-six languages include the languages of various ethnic groups in the Soviet Union, and the languages of many small ethnic groups were created only in the Soviet era. As for his works being translated into foreign languages, there are too many to mention.
    This prophetic poem of Pushkin was not published during his lifetime. Later, the one published before 1887 was also a revised version by the Tsar's tutor – the poet Zhukovsky. The one engraved on the Pushkin bronze statue in the center of Moscow was also a revised text. It was not until the centennial of Pushkin's death in 1937 that the original poem was re-engraved. For example, in the fourth sentence of the first section of the original poem, Pushkin was talking about the memorial column of Alexander I, but Zhukovsky changed it to the "Napoleon Column" (built in Paris in 1836 to commemorate Napoleon). As for why the Tsarist authorities wanted to modify his poems and were afraid of his works, it is not difficult for us to guess the reason.
    Pushkin's works were translated into Chinese as early as the 29th year of the Guangxu reign of the Qing Dynasty (1903). In recent years, there have been more translations of his works. This reminds me of an interesting thing: Pushkin was very interested in China during his lifetime and even pleaded with the Tsarist authorities to allow him to go to China with the envoys sent to China. Needless to say, under the conditions of Tsarist autocratic tyranny, his wish could not be realized. He could not have foreseen that, more than a hundred years after his death, his works would become one of the most precious spiritual foods for Chinese readers. Precisely because of this, as we commemorate the 150th anniversary of Pushkin's birth, we feel that the great poet Pushkin is closer to us, and at the same time, we feel that we should study Pushkin's works more and learn more from his strong and unyielding spirit of fighting for freedom.

　　伟大的俄罗斯诗人
  　普希金的生平和事业
    纪念普希金诞辰一百五十周年
    戈宝权
    在俄国的文学史上，普希金永远是一个最光辉的名字，大家经常都称他的名字是“俄罗斯民族的夸耀”和“俄罗斯诗坛的太阳”，而他对于俄罗斯文学和全世界文学的贡献，更是无限的大，象苏联中央执行委员会在一九三五年所发表的关于组织全苏联普希金纪念委员会的决议中，就称普希金是位“伟大的俄罗斯诗人”，是“俄罗斯文学语言的创建者和新俄罗斯文学的奠基者”，说“他用他不朽的艺术语言的作品，丰富了全人类”，这可说是对于普希金的一个最确切的评价。讲到他的不朽的艺术作品，在教育后代的事业上也起了莫大的影响，象俄国著名的革命思想家赫尔岑在“一个青年人的手记”中就写道：“伟大的普希金，是我们文学运动中的南面王；他的每一行诗从这一个人的手上传到另一个人的手上；印刷出来的本子‘不够供应’，手抄本在到处传播着……”。赫尔岑还又告诉我们，普希金的诗神缪斯，“并不是一个苍白无血色的人”，而是“一个热情的女性，头顶上冠盖着健康的光环”，这我们从他的一切作品中，可以得到一个最好的明证。
    今年的六月六日，是普希金这位大诗人的一百五十年诞辰，全苏联各地都举行盛大的庆祝会，北平市的文艺界也有一个纪念会，因此特借这个机会，把普希金的生平与事业介绍于此：
    普希金于一七九九年的六月六日，诞生在莫斯科的一个贵族人家。他的父亲是个自旧贵族出生的地主，母亲是“彼得大帝的黑奴”汉尼巴尔的孙女，因此在普希金的性格和外表上，就留着不少他这位先祖的征象。他幼年时，也正象当时所有贵族子弟一样，是在法国家庭教师的带管之下长大的，他所受的是法国式的教育，他的法文也远比俄文讲得流利。他对功课不很勤勉，并且还很懒惰，但是他本性却非常聪慧，他时常偷偷地钻进他父亲的藏书室，博览群书，在那儿一连消磨好几个钟头。一八一一年，就是当他十二岁时，彼得堡附近的沙皇村中专为贵胄子弟创办了一所中学，普希金就被送到那儿去读书。他在中学里就开始写诗，一八一四年七月间，他写的“致诗友”一诗，便刊载在“欧罗巴周报”上了。翌年正月间学校举行升级考试时，普希金当众朗诵他所写的“皇村回忆”一诗，深得大诗人杰尔若文的赞许。杰尔若文含着眼泪冲出来想吻他，但是羞涩得不知所措的普希金早已逃跑掉了，于是他就说道：“这就是那将要接替杰尔若文的人！”这个预言没有错，后来普希金的盛名不仅超过了杰尔若文，并且还成了俄国文学语言的创建者和新俄罗斯文学的奠基者。
    普希金于一八一七年六月从皇村中学毕业，旋即以十等文官的资格被派到外交部去服务。当时，这种服务只是挂个虚名，而他的兴趣却全在诗上。他这时写成了第一部长诗“罗斯郎和露德米娜”，并且还写了不少充满革命激情的诗。普希金在中学时已经受自由思想的薰染，尤其是当时驻扎在皇村的近卫骑兵团中，有一位名叫察尔达耶夫的军官，曾给了他很深的影响，因此有人说，他当时从察尔达耶夫那里所得到的，要比他在整个中学时代所得到的东西还多。普希金从中学毕业后写过一首“自由颂”，又写了“乡村”和“致察尔达耶夫”等诗，这些诗都透露出反对沙皇暴政的革命思想。不用说，这些革命的诗立即引起沙皇当局的注意，一八二○年的五月间，二十一岁的普希金就被沙皇亚历山大一世放逐到俄国南方去了。
    在南方居留的期间，正是革命运动蔓延于西欧之时、普希金对这些革命运动很为之向往，甚至想逃到国外去；同时他又和南方的秘密革命组织的许多团员往还，结果因为写了主张暗杀沙皇的“短剑”等诗，在一八二四年七月间又被逐出奥德萨，并在宪警的押送之下，解送到他父母的领地米哈伊洛夫村禁居。普希金在当时除掉写作之外，就寂寞而孤独地度过了两年的岁月。就在这个期间，十二月党人于一八二五年十二月十四日在彼得堡举行起义，反对沙皇专政，普希金的许多朋友都参加了，不幸这次起义终被沙皇当局镇压，五个负责的领袖被判处绞刑，其他一百多人被充军到西伯利亚去做苦役。普希金因为禁居在乡间，得免于难。后来新皇尼古拉一世召见普希金时，曾问过他：“普希金，假若你在彼得堡，你也会参加十二月十四日的那次起义吗？”普希金大胆地回答道：“一定的，皇上。”只从这一点，我们就可以看出普希金的反抗精神和坚强的态度了。
    这时普希金虽然得到新皇的赦免，实际上他却被俘于宫庭，成了宫庭的囚人。一来，他的一举一动都受到沙皇宫庭的特务组织“第三科”的监视；二来，他所有的作品都要经过沙皇的亲自审阅方可印行；三来，沙皇又看中了他新婚的美丽的妻子。沙皇于一八三四年任命他为宫庭近侍，使他的妻子有可能常常出入宫庭，参加宫庭舞会，并借此来屈辱普希金的身份。适巧这时又有一位名叫丹特士的法国军官来到彼得堡，也追求他的妻子，他的许多敌人就写匿名信给他，诋毁他。这一切都逼得普希金无法再容忍下去，终于和丹特士在一八三七年二月八日下午举行决斗，普希金受了重伤，二月十日下午二时四十五分就弃世长逝，沙皇更密令宪警将他的棺柩秘密地运送到他的故居米哈伊洛夫村附近的圣山镇安葬。当时有位教授夫人在某处驿站上看到这个用草席裹着的棺材，就问站在旁边的一个守望人这是怎么一回事，回答是：“天晓得这是怎么一回事。听说，一个什么姓普希金的人被打死了，他们就把他包在藁草和席子里沿着驿站飞奔——愿上帝宽恕我，就象拖着一头死狗一样”。
    普希金逝世时还才三十七岁，正是他生活的盛年！但就在这短短的二三十年中，他已经留下了无数珍贵的遗产。他一生中写过将近八百首诗，十几篇长诗，五篇故事诗，一篇历史剧“鲍里斯·戈都诺夫”和几个小悲剧，一些短篇小说和一本长篇小说“甲必丹之女”，此外还有些历史论著和批评文字等。普希金的写作虽然是多方面的，但他主要的还是一位诗人，因此当他逝世时，一家报纸上写道：“我们诗坛的太阳殒落了。”这句话并不过份。普希金的死，不用说，在当时曾引起社会人士的公愤，大家知道他是成了沙皇暴政的牺牲品，因此当时一位年青的诗人莱蒙托夫，曾写了一首“诗人之死”的诗，指出杀死普希金的一群凶手：
    “你们，站在宝座周围的贪婪的一群，全是自由、天才与光荣的刽子手！”
    普希金逝世到现在，已是一百十多年，杀害普希金这位诗人的沙皇政体，是早已被推翻了，在今天很少再有人会去想起那些暴虐的沙皇，但大家却常会想起普希金的名字，他的著作也被大量地翻印着，译成各国的文字，他的名字永远光辉地闪耀着，用他曾经在“致察尔达耶夫”一诗中的预言的话来说，那么
    “在专制暴政的废墟上，早已写上他的姓名的字样。”
    今年的六月六日，适逢他的一百五十年诞辰，当这个纪念日时，我们不妨讲一讲他所写的题名为“纪念碑”的诗，因为这首诗总结了他全部生活的旅程，也表现出了他坚强不屈的意志和崇高的精神。这首诗的全文是这样的：
    我为自己建立了一
    座非人工的纪念碑，
    在人们走向那儿的路
    径上，青草不再生长，
    它抬起那颗不肯屈服的
    头颅
    高耸在亚历山大的
    纪念石柱之上。
　
    不，我不会完全死
    亡——我的灵魂在圣洁
    的诗歌中，
    将比我的灰烬活得更
    久长，和逃避了腐朽灭
    亡，——
    我将永远光荣，即使
    还只有一个诗人
    活在月光下的世界
    上。
    我的名声将传遍整个
    伟大的俄罗斯，
    它现存的一切语言，
    都会讲着我的名字，
    无论是骄傲的斯拉夫
    人的子孙，是芬兰人，
    以及现在还是野蛮
    的通古斯人，和草原上
    的朋友——卡尔美克人。
　
    我所以永远能和
    人民亲近，
    是因为我曾用我的
    诗歌，唤起人们的善
    心，在这残酷的世纪
    ，我歌诵过自由，
    并为那些没落了的
    人们，祈求过怜悯同
    情。
　
    “哦，诗神缪斯，
    听从上帝的意旨吧，
    即不要畏惧屈辱，
    也不要希求桂冠，
    赞美和诽谤，都平
    心静气地容忍，
    也不要和愚妄人空
    作争论。”
    普希金的这首诗，是在他逝世前几个月写的，诗上注着“一八三六年八月廿一日于石岛”。其中第一节，就写出了他的不屈不挠的精神。他为什么拿他的纪念碑和亚历山大的纪念石柱相比呢？前面我已经讲过，普希金是被沙皇亚历山大一世放逐到俄国南方去的，因此他对这位沙皇就永远怀恨于心。一八三二年，沙皇政府为了纪念亚历山大一世，在彼得堡的冬宫广场上建立了一个高三十七公尺的纪念石柱，举行揭幕礼时，普希金因为不愿参加，曾暂时离开彼得堡，表示蔑视这个纪念柱，而他此处所说的，他所造的那个“非人工的纪念碑”，“抬起那颗不肯屈服的头颅，高耸在亚历山大的纪念石柱之上”，也正是表示这种不肯低头屈就的精神。第二节、第四节和第五节都写出了诗人的使命和节操，他“既不要畏惧侮辱，也不要希求桂冠，”他永远要为人民歌唱，这也就是他“永远能和人民亲近”的原因，象他在“先知”那首诗中也有类似的话，说诗人要“用语言去把人们的心灵烧亮”。第三节诗则写出了诗人的怀抱，希望他的名字会传遍俄罗斯，事实上普希金的名字是早已传遍全俄罗斯了。一八八八至一九一七年的期间，他的作品只以十四种文字印了一千零七十一万一千本；在一九一八至一九四七年的期间，就以七十六种文字印行了三千五百四十二万九千本，在这七十六种文字中，包括苏联各民族的文字，并且有许多小民族的文字，还是在苏联时代才创造出来的，至于他的作品被译为外国文字的，更是不胜枚举了。
    普希金的这首预言似的诗在他的生前未曾发表，后来在一八八七年前所发表的，也是沙皇的师傅——诗人茹柯夫斯基修改的稿本；莫斯科城中心的普希金铜像上所刻的，也是改订的文字，直到一九三七年普希金逝世百年祭时，方改刻原诗。即如原诗的第一节第四句，普希金所讲的是亚历山大一世的纪念石柱，但茹柯夫斯基却将它改成“拿破仑纪念柱”（一八三六年为了纪念拿破仑而在巴黎建立的）。至于沙皇当局为什么要修改他的诗和害怕他的作品，那我们就不难猜出它的原因来了。
    普希金的作品，远在清光绪二十九年（一九○三年）就被译为中文，近年来他的作品的译本更多。这就使我回想起一件有趣的事，就是普希金生前对中国很感兴趣，甚至向沙皇当局恳求允许他跟派往中国的使节到中国来，不用说，在沙皇专制暴政的条件之下，他这个愿望是无法实现的，他也无法能预料到，在他逝世百余年后的今日，他的作品会成为中国读者的一份最珍贵的精神食粮。正因为这样，当此纪念普希金的一百五十年诞辰时，我们就感觉到普希金这位大诗人对我们更为亲近，同时也感觉到，我们应该多多研究普希金的作品，和多多学习他那种坚强不屈的为自由而斗争的精神。
