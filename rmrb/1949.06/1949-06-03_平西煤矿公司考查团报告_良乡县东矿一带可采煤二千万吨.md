　　Pingxi Coal Mine Company Inspection Team Report
  　Estimated 20 Million Tons of Extractable Coal in the Dong Mine Area of Liangxiang County
    [Our Newspaper] To extensively develop the Pingxi coalfield, the Pingxi Coal Mine Company dispatched an inspection team on the 19th of last month, composed of ten individuals including Zhou Lunyuan and Zhao Shouyi, engineers from the North China Enterprise Department; Zhu Jiepu, Director of the Mining Research Institute; Gao Ping, Director of the Geological Survey Institute; and Wang Zigu, an engineer from the Pingxi Coal Mine Company. They went to the Dong Mine area of Liangxiang County to investigate coal deposits and matters related to mining and transportation. After a week of arduous work, they returned to Ping on the 20th of last month. Yesterday afternoon (the 2nd), the Pingxi Coal Mine Company discussed the materials obtained by the inspection team. According to the inspection team's report, the Liangxiang coal mining area covers approximately 57 square kilometers, with an estimated extractable amount of approximately 20 million tons. It is a relatively well-formed coalfield with good quality (anthracite) and relatively easy to mine. The biggest difficulty at present is transportation. The company believes that once the five-kilometer elevated railway and high-voltage power lines from Tuo Li to Dong Mine are restored, machine mining can be resumed on the one hand, and the transportation problem can be solved on the other, with 700 to 800 tons of coal being transported from Dong Mine to Tuo Li daily. Note: Farmers in the Liangxiang Dong Mine area rely on farming and can only earn enough grain to sustain three months of living each year, with most relying on coal mining for survival. Therefore, after restoring machine mining and transportation, their year-round living problems can be solved.

　　平西煤矿公司考查团报告
  　良乡县东矿一带可采煤二千万吨
    【本报讯】平西煤矿公司为大量开采平西煤田，曾于上月十九日由华北企业部工程师周抡元、赵寿彝、矿业研究所所长朱介圃、地质调查所所长高平、平西煤矿公司工程师王子固等十人组织考查团，赴良乡县东矿一带考查煤藏及开采、运输诸事宜。经一星期的艰苦工作，已于上月二十日返平。平西煤矿公司于昨日下午（二日）与考查团研究所获材料。根据考查团报告：良乡煤矿区面积约五十七方公里，可采量约二千万吨。为较整齐之煤田，质量亦好（无烟煤），开采也较易。目前最大困难是运输问题。该公司认为只要修复坨里至东矿五公里之高线铁路及高压电线后，一面可恢复机器开采，一面解决了运输问题，每日可有七、八百吨煤由东矿运至坨里。按：良乡东矿一带农民依靠种地每年只能收入维持三个月生活的粮食，大部依采煤为生。因此恢复机器开采与运输问题后，即可解决其全年生活问题。
