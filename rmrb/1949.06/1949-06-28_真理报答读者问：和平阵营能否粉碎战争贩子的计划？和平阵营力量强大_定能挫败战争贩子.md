Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 27th: TASS Moscow, 25th: The Truth publishes in a prominent position Mayevsky's reply to the question posed by the newspaper's readers, "Can the Peace Camp Shatter the War-mongers' Plans?" Mayevsky writes that the salient feature of the international situation after the Second World War is the sharp division of forces: on the one hand, the camp of peace and democracy headed by the Soviet Union, and on the other hand, the camp of imperialism and war headed by the Anglo-American reactionaries. The struggle between these two camps is marked by the steady growth of the strength of the democratic camp and the gradual weakening of the imperialist camp.
    The Second World War has already shown the people of all countries that it is not enough to hate war, but it is also necessary to actively fight against the launching of new massacres. The war-mongers, lacking mass support, are trying to deceive the people by relying on vicious slanderous propaganda against the Soviet Union and the People's Democratic countries. In this ugly endeavor, the imperialists have gained the help of right-wing Social Democrats, bourgeois nationalists, and other lackeys of the capitalists. However, the political consciousness of the masses is growing steadily.
    The camp of peace and democracy has developed into a powerful force. Although the adventurous policies of imperialism do not rule out the possibility of various provocations, the vigilance of the people of all countries, the relentless exposure of the war-mongers' plots, and the further unity of the forces of peace and democracy headed by the Soviet Union, guarantee that the anti-popular military plans of the imperialists will certainly be thwarted.

　　真理报答读者问：和平阵营能否粉碎战争贩子的计划？
    和平阵营力量强大　定能挫败战争贩子
    【新华社北平二十七日电】塔斯社莫斯科二十五日讯：真理报以显著地位登载马耶夫斯基对该报读者所提出的问题“和平阵营能否粉碎战争贩子的计划”的答复。马耶夫斯基写道，第二次世界大战之后，国际形势显著的特点，就是力量的尖锐划分：一方面是以苏联为首的和平与民主阵营，另一方面是以美英反动派为首的帝国主义与战争阵营。这两个阵营之间的斗争，是以民主阵营力量的稳步增长与帝国主义阵营的日渐削弱为标志的。
    第二次世界大战业已向各国人民表明，憎恨战争是不够的，还必须积极地进行反对发动新的大屠杀的斗争。战争贩子们因为没有群众支持，便力图依靠对苏联与人民民主国家的恶毒的诽谤宣传来欺骗人民。在这一丑恶的勾当上，帝国主义者获得了右翼社会党人、资产阶级民族主义者以及资本家的其他从仆们的帮助。但是，人民群众底政治觉悟正在节节增长。
    和平与民主阵营业已发展成为强大的力量。虽然，帝国主义的冒险主义政策，并不排除种种挑衅的可能性；但是各国人民的警觉、对战争贩子图谋的无情揭露、以及以苏联为首的和平与民主力量的更进一步团结，保证着帝国主义者反人民的军事计划一定被挫败。
