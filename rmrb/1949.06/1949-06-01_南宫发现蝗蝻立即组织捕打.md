　　Nangong Discovers Locust Nymphs and Immediately Organizes Capture and Elimination

    [Reported by this newspaper] On the evening of May 23rd, locust nymphs were simultaneously discovered in the ninth district of Nangong County along the banks of the Qingyang River, from Heshengdian in the north to Wanhuzhuang in the south, covering more than ten miles, including Nanwangjia, Zhaiguzhai, Anziwo, and Majia Heya villages. The nymphs had just emerged after the rain and were still in the grass nests at the bottom of the river, not yet ashore. After hearing the news, the district immediately notified the villages where the locusts were found to go and capture and eliminate them. At the same time, they telephoned the county party committee to report the situation. The county party committee rewarded the district's correct measures in promptly discovering the insect plague and quickly resolving it. The committee also issued instructions: (1) Dig ditches to drive the locusts into the ditches and bury them; (2) Mobilize the masses to use their shoe soles to beat them; (3) Immediately contact Qinghe County, a neighboring county, to prevent the plague from spreading. The district was encouraged to concentrate its efforts to completely eliminate the locusts and not to become complacent because of the initial discovery. In addition to reporting to the prefectural committee, the county party committee also solemnly informed other districts of the county by telephone, urging them to be vigilant and to capture and eliminate locusts whenever they are discovered, strictly preventing complacency from leading to disaster.
