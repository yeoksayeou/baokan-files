Notice Regarding Real Estate Registration in the Urban Area of Beiping Municipality

    I. All owners of real estate within the urban area of this municipality must personally come to this Bureau to apply for registration within the period stipulated by the Bureau (those who have already obtained land ownership certificates issued by the pseudo-Land Administration Bureau and whose real estate status has not changed may postpone application).
    II. In the event of any transfer of real estate (including buying and selling, gifting, and exchange), both the new and old rights holders shall jointly come to the Bureau in person to apply for registration. The aforementioned application shall be made within one month from the date of establishment of the contract by both parties; late applications will be subject to an additional registration fee of one times the original amount.
    III. For real estate transfer contracts that were established before the commencement of registration business at this Bureau, all applications must be made at the Bureau within one month from the date of commencement of registration. If the original rights holder is indeed unable to jointly apply due to reasons, the current rights holder shall be permitted to handle it independently by obtaining a guarantee from a reputable store. Late applications must be made jointly by the new and old rights holders, and an additional registration fee will be levied in accordance with the provisions of Article II, Paragraph 2.
    IV. Registration of other real estate rights (provisionally defined as four types: usufructuary mortgage, mortgage, surface rights, and easements) must be applied for jointly in person by both the rights holder and the obligor.
    Land and houses without registered ownership shall not be subject to registration of other rights.      (To be continued)
