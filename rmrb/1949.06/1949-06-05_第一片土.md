　　The First Piece of Soil
　　Hu Feng
　　We arrived at the sea off Wangjia Island at dusk and dropped anchor. The sky was gloomy, and a biting snow wind was blowing. From the deck, the bottom of the island was a cliff, its black rock face looming over the slightly gliding, also black, seawater. From the cliff, the island surface was covered in patchy snow, interspersed with black blocks, lines, or dots. There were no lights, and no trees or houses could be seen.

　　Wangjia Island, the first stop in the new world we were heading for. It stood there in the snow wind, a weathered, expressionless, solemn outpost.

　　The next morning, as I was packing, Old Xu from another cabin came over. The ear flaps of his fur hat were pulled down tightly, and a wool scarf was wrapped around his ＠, leaving only his bespectacled face visible. As soon as he came in, he asked, "Will this keep my ears from freezing off?" Two people laughed. Old Xu was from the South, had lived in Southeast Asia for a long time, and had never seen snow. During the voyage, everyone was afraid of the cold in the Northeast, and someone said that you could accidentally freeze your ears off. This made a deep impression on someone who had never seen snow.

　　Old Du, who had gone to the bow to see what was happening, returned. He was also "fully armed" with a coat, gloves, and a wool scarf. As soon as he entered the cabin, he excitedly reported, "Some children from the liberated areas have come aboard, all with red faces and wrapped in ragged cotton batting, very thick, very thick...." The way he spoke, he seemed to envy the ragged batting very much, as if it would be great if he could wrap his own feet in it.

　　Soon, a merchant from the front cabin came to report that people had come from the shore and wanted to meet with us. Old Du went, and we all moved our luggage to the open deck in the middle of the ship. Just as we finished moving, Old Du came to call us to the front cabin. Walking to the corridor in front of the cabin, we met several soldiers. They were wearing yellow cotton coats, cotton military caps with the ear flaps down, and carrying rifles. However, one of them was not wearing a cotton coat or a military cap; he was wearing a clip-on military cap and a military uniform, and he had a Mauser pistol hanging on him. Old Du introduced him as Wang, the director of the Wangjia Island sub-station. He shook hands with us, rubbing his hands together. His young face was also red, and he just smiled, saying a sentence and laughing once. He said that our place is too unsightly, very dirty, comrades might as well stay on the ship for another day, and take the steamer directly to the shore tomorrow. He said a sentence and laughed once, and after he finished speaking, he was still rubbing his hands and smiling, only he stopped laughing out loud. I suddenly thought: How is he not cold?…

　　We agreed, so we moved the luggage back into the cabin. But after we finished moving, we suddenly thought that since we had arrived, we should go up. Regardless of the trouble it would cause them, it was a rare opportunity to stay on the island for a day or two. Old Du went to discuss it with Director Wang, and came back to say that Director Wang agreed. He was very happy that everyone wanted to go up....

　　The people and luggage were first lowered into a small steamer, which sailed to the edge of the island, and then transferred to the shore in batches by small wooden boats. We saw that there were small trees on the island, and we also found a village. They seemed to slowly stand up from the ground. Although there was no sun, the weather was clear, and the wind didn't seem so cold. We walked cheerfully on the shore, some deliberately running onto the loose sand, letting their leather shoes sink in. With each step, they sank in, and they couldn't help but laugh.

　　The luggage was put together and guarded by a soldier. Everyone set off with just small briefcases and the like. We walked on the road sparsely covered with snow. Walking along the edge of the wheat field, we saw small wooden signs with writing on them standing there, and there were also some further ahead. Suddenly, we had a feeling: this land had broken free from the chains that had bound it together, and now it was standing here, equal and free. Walking close to a small village of two or three families on the hillside, a young woman dressed neatly was sitting in front of the door doing something. When she saw us, she stopped what she was doing and looked at us frankly. Her posture seemed very comfortable, as if she was sitting in the warm spring sunshine.

　　The frozen snow road was slippery. As we walked, we slipped from time to time. Some people laughed out loud as they slipped. The people who reached the top of the hill first sat down to rest, watching the people behind them slip and slide uphill, laughing happily. The people behind them laughed as they slipped and slid uphill. Like a group of children, including two merchants who had come with us to the sub-station to handle unloading procedures. One merchant felt that the road was slippery, and it would be better to walk on the snow next to it, but as soon as he stepped one foot over, he slipped and fell. Everyone laughed even more loudly and happily. He himself, lying on the ground, also laughed sheepishly.

　　Reaching the top of the hill, we walked along a section of the ridge and then descended into a depression, which was a village of dozens of households facing another bay. We had arrived.

　　Passing through the outer courtyard walled with stones, we walked in a long line into the civilian house used as the sub-station's office. It was a small three-room house, with a large stove on each side of the middle room as we entered. We were led into the room on the left. Standing on the edge of the kang near the door to greet us was a polite young man wearing a half-worn yellow cotton military uniform. He was not tall, and his Western-style black hair was not so messy. There was a hint of a shallow black downy mustache on his upper lip. This was Director Liu of the Zhuanghe County Public Security Bureau, who had come to this border line for a few days to understand the situation and formulate regulations because large cargo ships had recently started to dock here to load and unload goods. He shook hands with us quietly, his eyes gentle and calm, mostly looking down. When he looked up, he also looked at the front aimlessly, without the slightest bit of special observation of the other person.

　　We sat down. The kang was full, and there were four or five more sitting on chairs below. The room was packed. Director Liu sat cross-legged in the corner of the kang near the door. After we explained to him how we knew we were causing them trouble, but that we had to get off the ship, he said quietly:

　　"Now that you've arrived home, how can you not come down..."

　　He said it so quietly that it felt like only saying it so quietly could express the sincere meaning behind these words.

　　What about Director Wang? He ran in and out, directing two soldiers to make tea, and he himself held a pot and poured it into bowls, delivering them to everyone's hands. He still said something and laughed once, as if every sentence was naturally connected to a laugh, as if there was some force making him have to laugh. Whoever finished their tea, or even only drank half of it, he would immediately come to refill it for you. No matter how you refused him, he wouldn't listen, and he still said a sentence and laughed once as he refilled it for you.

　　The two merchants, sitting in chairs by the table, also laughed happily with us, but finally returned to themselves and began to talk about the procedures for importing goods in a cautious and respectful tone. Director Liu got off the kang and sat next to them, still mostly looking down, still using a quiet tone to explain things to them one by one, as if he was explaining work to familiar comrades. After they finished talking, one merchant said with a slightly hesitant smile:

　　"We brought a small case of beer, to give to Director Liu and all the comrades, just a small token..."

　　Director Liu did not look up, and still said in a quiet tone:

　　"No need, we don't accept it, you can take it back...."

　　The merchants' smiling faces showed a look of bewilderment, but they still said:

　　"This is nothing, it's what we had left over from drinking on the ship..."

　　Director Liu still did not look up, and still said in a quiet tone:

　　"We don't need it, you can take it back and drink it yourselves...."

　　The merchants seemed to understand, and laughed in bewilderment, saying nothing more.

　　On the way, when we went to the cabin to sit idly, we saw the merchants送beer to the helm twice, to our captain who we called a Norwegian hooligan. And once, we met the captain coming to the cabin, and the merchants scrambled to open two bottles of beer to treat him. They were treating the beer as a magic weapon, trying to please him so that he would sail faster and arrive sooner. But now, this magic weapon had lost its allure, and couldn't be given away.

　　As he warmly saw off the two merchants and turned back, one of us, as if not reassured, told him:

　　"The merchants are very cunning, they smuggle, they bring pens and watches...."

　　He sat cross-legged in the original corner of the kang, seeming even more comfortable, and still said in a quiet voice:

　　"Of course they want to get some benefits, we'll let them get some benefits too."

　　Later, he instructed Director Wang: "All luggage must be checked. If they bring one or two extra pens, one or two watches, don't bother them, let them go. If there are more, they have to pay taxes. All cigarettes will be confiscated. Tell them again: weapons must be registered. Foreigners are absolutely not allowed to go ashore. Chinese crew members are also not allowed to go ashore. Taking pictures is not allowed. If you see anyone take out a camera, confiscate it...."

　　The young director, with a smile, bent over and listened quietly, this time not laughing out loud, just repeatedly responding with "Yes!" "Yes!"

　　It turned out that the merchants had raised the issue with him when they were talking, that the foreigners wanted to go ashore and take a look, and that it was okay to just walk around on the mountain by the sea, just to look at the scenery, and not do anything. But he immediately refused.

　　"That's absolutely not allowed. Our territory is sacred and cannot be allowed to go ashore casually. For the past hundred years, foreigners haven't treated Chinese people as people, and anyone who wanted to could just barge in and out. That's not allowed now, that's the purpose of our revolution. Every Chinese person is worthy of pride. Tell them: if they go ashore privately, we will arrest them immediately...."

　　He was still speaking in his usual quiet tone, as if he was patiently explaining to a child who had made an unreasonable request. But this quietness seemed like the surface of the water in the middle of a stone mountain gorge, and people could feel that there was a force of attack beneath the calmness.

　　After eating, rice and four meat dishes, we returned to the kang. Some sat, some lay down, the kang was full. There were also people sitting on chairs on the ground. Director Liu was still sitting cross-legged in that corner of the kang. Director Wang came to pour tea again, running in and out. But finally, he sat down next to Director Liu and joined the conversation.

　　There were many people, and the kang was hot. The paper-pasted window was propped up halfway. The皑皑 white snow on the opposite mountain was reflected in calmly.

　　The conversation flowed out naturally like a spring from beneath that shallow black downy mouth, gradually converging into a river, quiet, yet rippling with alluring ripples.

　　These three years of struggle have gone through a very arduous process. First of all, we encountered the stubborn orthodox ideas of the people of Northeast China, who held blind illusions about the Kuomintang and Chiang Kai-shek. And the revolutionary forces were in an absolutely inferior position.

　　"Chairman Mao often said: In Northeast China, we only have 20,000 cadres, 24 Central Committee members, and 100,000 troops. That's all we have to our name..."

　　He himself was one of these 20,000 cadres, joining the East Cadre Corps after August 15th, departing from Yan'an and rushing to Northeast China. Every day they rushed on the road, and when they were exhausted, they couldn't help but think that they would rest for a day or two when they arrived, but before they arrived, the central government's telegram had already arrived first, as usual with the eight characters "昼夜兼程，风雨无阻" (day and night, regardless of wind or rain).

　　Taking North Manchuria as an example, at that time, each county could only send a county party secretary, a county head, a squadron leader, and a platoon of soldiers. In the county where he participated in the work, just after entering the county town and stationing in a courtyard, they were surrounded, and they couldn't even get out of the courtyard. Supplies had to be smuggled in. And the Kuomintang's appointment letters were flying all over the place, buying off bandits and puppet troops. There were more than 5,000 guns outside the city, and it took more than three months of being surrounded to slowly open up the situation.

　　During that difficult period, there was even a plan to withdraw from Harbin, but they finally persevered and overcame it. On the one hand, the Kuomintang's strategic errors also helped. At that time, they did not concentrate their forces to defeat them one after another, but instead divided their forces to attack both North and South Manchuria simultaneously. Moreover, due to internal contradictions, they were hesitant, which gave us a greater opportunity to organize our forces. At that time, only Du Yuming saw this clearly, but his main proposition was rejected. If we had followed him, we would have faced greater difficulties.

　　After the Three Down the South of the Yangtze and Four Defenses of Linjiang, the situation gradually turned around. Three times crossing the Songhua River to strike south was a political recovery and improvement of the people's confidence, and a military exercise to prepare for a major counter-offensive. But marching and fighting in such cold weather resulted in more than 5,000 people being frostbitten. In South Manchuria, they were forced to the Linjiang line, with the Soviet border behind them, and they were not allowed to enter. When the Kuomintang was pressing very close, sometimes there was only a narrow strip of land about five miles wide. But because they were concerned that the Soviet border was behind them, they did not dare to use cannons indiscriminately. In such a small area, sometimes there was nothing to eat, but they finally repelled the Kuomintang's four offensives.

　　But the turning around of the Northeast situation must of course be attributed to strong political factors. One was that the Kuomintang educated the people of Northeast China with facts. Wherever the Kuomintang went, the orthodox ideas there would be swept away, and the people would completely turn to the revolution. But the main thing was that the party's leading policies were completely correct: land reform, protecting industry and commerce, and repairing railways. These three things completely recovered the hearts of the people in Northeast China. Taking the last thing as an example—

　　"Everyone says, 'The Eighth Route Army, they only know how to destroy roads,' but now, while fighting, they are repairing the railways, which makes ordinary people admire them very much and has a great impact...."

　　Later, they launched a "correction" campaign to stop the erroneous over-leftist tendencies and unite the middle peasants, and the revolutionary forces became even more consolidated....

　　The sound waves flowed quietly like a small river, taking a panoramic view of the entire Northeast land that had stood up straight from the heroic struggle, and displaying the bloody path of the past three years that had been opened up from the heroic struggle. Moreover, these sound waves were formed by very concrete expressions. For example, when talking about the Kuomintang's internal contradictions, they specifically talked about how Xiong Shihui was, how Chen Cheng was, how Du Yuming was, and how Zheng Dongguo was.

　　The sound waves flowed quietly like a small river, without the slightest hint of hypocrisy trying to convince people, without the slightest hint of excitement inflated by the confidence of victory, let alone any kind of boasting to show oneself or not forget oneself. Undoubtedly, this analytical narrative came from the party's summary, or at least was derived based on the party's summary. However, when talking about concrete facts, it seemed as if he himself had participated in them. When describing the understanding of those concrete facts, it seemed as if it had undergone countless audits in feeling, so it was said so surely, and the tone reached such quietness and such intimacy.

　　One of us asked:

　　"Now, can the entire Northeast be well-fed and well-clothed?"

　　The sound of this sentence made me feel a strange feeling. It was not an affirmative assumption that of course it was well-fed and well-clothed, so there was no need to ask, but I still couldn't help but feel a strange feeling. Perhaps because the way of asking and the tone seemed to have the flavor of a foreign journalist.

　　But he didn't seem to have any such feeling at all, and still answered in a quiet tone:

　　"I don't dare to say. The situation in North Manchuria is different from that in South Manchuria. In North Manchuria, when we first came, the peasants were very poor. Some peasant women didn't even have pants to wear in winter, so they had to stay in the 兀拉草 (ula grass) all day long. Chairman Mao said that the Chinese people are full of hardships, and only when you really go into the people can you understand the meaning of this sentence. Now, tattered, but they have all managed to put something on. In South Manchuria, the clothes are better, but the population is dense, and there was a famine last year. In some places, we tried our best to find ways to get through the famine, and some still relied mostly on soybean cakes and wild vegetables. In order to save money, last year, the public only supplied ten months of provisions to county-level cadres in Northeast China, and they had to rely on their own production for the remaining two months. Like the group of soldiers stationed here, they all have to produce their own provisions...."

　　One of us immediately became a little agitated:

　　"Oh dear! You treated us so well just now, that one meal used up so many days for you, it's really embarrassing!"

　　These words didn't need to be said, but after saying them, it seemed as if they had to be said. The rice and four meat dishes from just now immediately floated into my eyes.

　　But he still said in a quiet tone:

　　"This little bit doesn't matter. It's a rare thing that you're passing through here...." (To be continued)

　　第一片土
    胡风
    黄昏的时候到达王家岛的海面，下了锚。天色阴沉，吹着凛冽的雪风。从甲板上望去，岛底一端是悬岩，岩壁黑沉沉地俯临着微微滑动的，也是黑沉沉的海水。从悬岩上面一直连过去，岛面上都是花搭搭的积雪片，雪片中间杂着黑色的块块，条条，或点点。不见灯火，也发现不出树木和房子。
    王家岛，我们所奔赴的新世界的第一站。在雪风里面它屹立着，一个饱经风霜的、不现出任何表情的、庄严的哨岗。
    第二天一早，正在收拾东西，住在另一舱房的老许来了。他皮帽子的护风耳已经拉下来扣得紧紧的，＠子四周还缠好了羊毛围巾，只露出一个戴着眼镜的面孔。一走进来就问：“这样会不会冻掉耳朵？”有两个人笑了。老许是南方人，久住南洋，生平没有看见过雪，航行中大家都害怕东北的冷，有人说不小心会冻掉耳朵，这对于生平没有看见过雪的人大概是印象太深了。
    到船头去看动静的老杜回来了。他也是大衣、手套、羊毛巾，“全副武装”，一进舱就兴头头地报告：“几个解放区的小孩子上船来了，都是面孔红红的，脚上都包着破棉絮，很厚很厚……。”看他说话的口气，好象对那破棉絮非常羡慕，如果自己的脚也能够包上，就好了。
    不一会，前面楼舱的商人来报告，说岸上来了人，叫去会面。老杜去了，我们大家搬行李，搬到船中部的露天甲板上。刚刚搬完，老杜来叫我们上前面楼舱去。走到楼舱前面的走廊，就遇到几个战士。穿着黄色棉大衣，棉军帽拉下了护风耳，背着大枪，但是，那里面有一个没有穿棉大衣，也没有戴棉军帽；夹的军帽，夹的军装，挂着一支盒子枪。经老杜介绍，他是驻王家岛的王分所长。他和我们握了手，两只手搓着，年青的脸上也是红红的，只是笑，说一句笑一声。他说，咱们这地方太不象样子，脏得很，同志们不如在船上再待一天，明天坐汽船直接上岸。说一句笑一声，说完了以后还是搓着两手笑着，只是停止了笑出声来罢了。我忽然想到：他怎么不冷呢？……
    我们同意了，于是又把行李往舱里搬。但搬完了以后忽然想到，既然到了就应该上去，顾不得麻烦他们，在岛上住一两天也是难得的机会。老杜去和王所长商量，回来说，王所长同意了，大家愿意上去，他高兴得很。……
    人和行李先下到了小汽船，开到岛边，再用小木船分批拨到岸上。看到了岛上有不大的树木，也发现了村庄。它们好象慢慢地从地上站了起来一样。虽然没有太阳，但天气是开朗的，风也似乎并不那么冷。我们愉快的在岸边走动，有的故意跑到浮沙上面，让皮鞋陷了进去。走一步陷一步，心里只想笑。
    行李归在一起，由一个战士守着，大家仅仅提着小提包之类出发了。在稀疏地盖着雪片的路上走着。走在麦地边，看到那里立着写了字的小木牌，远一点的前面也立着有，突然有了一种感觉：这土地已经挣脱了被捆在一起的锁练，现在是各各平等地站在这里，自由自地在站在这里了。走近两三户人家的山坡上的小村旁边，一个穿得干净的青年妇女坐在门前做着什么，看到我们就停住手坦然地望着，她那姿势现得很舒适，好象是坐在暖和的春光里面。
    冻了的雪路是滑的，走着，时不时要滑一下，有的人，一面滑一面嘻嘻地笑出了声来。先走到山头上的人就坐下来休息，望着后面的人一滑一滑地往上走，愉快的笑着。后面的人一面笑着一面一滑一滑地往上走。象一群小孩子，连两个和我们一道到分驻所办卸货手续的商人在内。一个商人，觉得路滑，不如在旁边的积雪上好走，但刚跨过去一只脚，就滑倒了。大家更愉快地高声笑了起来。倒在地上的他自己也嘻嘻地笑。
    到了山头，走过一段山脊路，再下到一个洼地，是一个临着另一边的海湾的几十户的村子，到了。
    穿过用石块堆成围墙的外院，我们一长串走进了分驻所办公用的民房。小小三间，进门的当中一间每边一口大灶。被引进了左首的一间里面。站在靠门的炕边迎接着我们的，是一个穿着半旧的黄色棉军服的斯斯文文的青年人，个子不高，西式的黑色头发并不那么乱，上唇有一抹开始现出了浅黑色绒毛似的胡子。这是庄河县公安局刘局长，因为最近开始有的来的大货船靠这里装卸货物，特地到这国境线来住几天了解情况，制定规章的。他文静地和我们握手，眼色柔和而又镇定，大半俯视着，抬起头来的时候也是漫无目的地望着前面，没有一丝一毫特别观察对方的神气。
    坐下了。坐了一满炕，下面还有四五个坐在椅子上。满满一屋子。刘局长盘着腿坐在靠门的炕角上。我们向他解释了虽然知道使他们麻烦，但也非下船不可的心情以后，他文静地说：
    “到了家，哪能不下来……”
    他说得那么文静，使人觉得，只有说得那么文静才能够表现出这句话后面的诚恳的意思。
    王所长呢？他跑出跑进，指挥着两个战士泡了茶来，他自己也拿着一把壶一碗一碗地倒着送到大家手上。依然是说一句什么就笑一声，好象每一句话都天生地连着一句笑声，好象有一股什么力量使得非笑不可似的。谁把茶喝完了，甚至只喝了一半，他就马上来替你添满，无论你怎样推辞他也不听，依然是说一句笑一声地替你添满了。
    两个商人，坐在靠着桌子的椅子上，也和我们一道愉快地笑着，但终于回复到了自己，开始用谨慎而恭敬的口气谈起了货物进口的手续问题。刘局长走下炕去坐在他们旁边，依然是眼光大半俯视着，依然是用着文静的声调一件一件地向他们解释，象是向熟悉的同志交待工作一样。谈完了以后，一个商人带着略略有些踌躇的笑容说：
    “我们带来了一小箱啤酒，送刘局长和诸位同志，小意思……”
    刘局长没有拾起头来，依然用着文静的声调说：
    “不用，我们不接受，你们带回去罢。……”
    商人们微笑的脸色上现出了惶惑的神气，但依然说：
    “这不算什么，我们在船上喝剩的……”
    刘局长还是没有抬起头来，还是用着文静的声调说：
    “我们用不着，你们带回去自己喝。……”
    商人们好象懂得了，惶惑地笑着，不再说什么了。
    在路上，我们到楼舱去闲坐的时候，有两次看见商人送啤酒到舵楼上去，给我们叫他挪威流氓的船主。还有一次，遇见那船主到楼舱来，商人抢着开了两瓶啤酒请他。他们是把啤酒当作法宝，取好他，想他开快些，早点到达的。但现在，这法宝失去了诱惑性，送不出去了。
    当他亲切地送走了两个商人转来，我们里面的谁好象不放心似地告诉他：
    “商人狡猾得很，他们走私，带了钢笔手表。……”
    他盘着腿坐到了原来的炕角上，好象更舒适了一些，依然用着文静的声音说：
    “他们当然是要得好处的，我们也让他们得点好处。”
    后来他交待王所长：“行李都要检查。多带一两支钢笔，一两个手表，不管他，让他去。多了就要上税。香烟一律没收。再告诉他们一遍：武器要登记。外国人绝对不准上岸。中国船员也不能上岸。不准照像，看见谁拿出照像机，就没收下来。……”
    青年所长含着微笑屈着身子静静地听着，这次不发出笑声了，只是“对！”“对！”地连声应着。
    原来，商人和他谈话的时候就提出过，外国人想上岸来看一看，就在靠海边的山头上走一走也可以，只是看一看风景，什么也不做。但他马上拒绝了。
    “那绝对不行。我们的国土是神圣的，不能让他们随便上岸。百把年以来，外国人把中国人不当人，谁高兴就可以随便闯出闯进。现在可不行了，这就是我们革命的目的。每一个中国人值得骄傲。告诉他们：如果私自上岸，我们要马上逮捕起来的。……”
    他依然是用照例的文静的气调说着，好象是向提出了不正当的要求的小孩子耐心地解说着一样。但这文静好象是石头山峡中间的水面，人可以感觉得到，那平静的下面是有着一股突击的力量的。
    吃过饭，大米饭和四样荤菜，又回到了炕上。坐的坐，躺的躺，一满炕。地下的椅子上还坐得有。刘局长还是盘着腿在那炕角上坐着。王所长又来倒茶了，跑出跑进。但终于在刘局长旁边坐下参加了谈话。
    人多，热炕。把纸糊的窗门支起了一半。对面山上皑皑的白雪平静地映了进来。
    谈话泉水似地从那浅黑色绒毛的嘴唇下面自然地流出，渐渐地汇成了一条河，文静，然而动漾着诱人的涟漪。
    这三年多的斗争，是通过了非常艰苦的过程的。首先，碰着了东北人民的顽强的正统观念，他们对国民党和蒋介石抱着盲目的幻想。而革命的力量又是在绝对的劣势里面。
    “毛主席常常说：我们在东北，只有两万干部，二十四个中委，和十万部队。就只有这么一点家当。……”
    他自己也是这两万干部里面的一个，八、一五以后参加东干团，从延安出发，赶到东北来的。每天赶路，走得筋疲力尽了的时候就不免想，走到了要休息一两天罢，但还没有到，中央的电报已经先到了，照例是“昼夜兼程，风雨无阻”八个字。
    就北满说罢，当时每县只能去一个县委书记，一个县长，一个中队长，和一排人的战士。他参加工作的那一县，刚刚走进县城在一个院子里驻下，就被包围起来了，连院子都出不来，给养要设法偷运进去。而国民党的委任状满天飞，收买胡子、伪军、城外就有五千多支枪，被包围了三个多月才慢慢打开了局面的。
    在那个艰苦的时期，甚至预备从哈尔滨撤退，但终于坚持地渡过了。一方面，国民党的战略错误也帮了忙，当时他们不集中力量先后击破，却分兵南北满同时进攻，而且由于内部矛盾，还踌躇不定，这就给了我们更大的组织力量的机会。当时只有杜聿明看清了这一点，但的底主张被否决了，如果依他了他，那我们要受到更大照困难的。
    到三下江南，四保临江以后，局势就渐渐扭转了过来。三次渡过松花江向南出击，在政治上是恢复和提高人民的信心，在军事上是准备大反攻的演习，但在那样天寒地冻的时候行军作战，仅仅冻伤的就有五千多人。在南满，被逼到了临江那一线，后面是苏联国境，不让进去，国民党逼得顶近的时候，有时只剩有五里路左右宽的一个狭长地带，但因为顾忌后面是苏联国境，他们也就不敢乱用大炮。在那样狭小的地面，有时什么吃的也没有，但终于打退了国民党四次的进攻。
    但扭转了东北局势的，当然要归结到强有力的政治因素。一个是国民党用事实教育了东北人民，国民党到了什么地方，那里的正统观念就一扫而光，人民完全倾向了革命。但主要的还是党的领导政策完全正确：土地改革，保护工商业，修复铁路，这三件事完全收复了东北的人心。就最后一件说罢—
    “都说，八路八路，就只会拔路，但现在，一面打仗一面把铁路修复了，使一般人佩服得很，影响很大。……”
    后来又发动了“纠偏”，制止了错误的过左的倾向，团结了中农，革命的力量就更加巩固了。……
    声浪象小河一样文静地流着，鸟瞰了从壮烈的斗争里面站直了身子的全东北的土地，展示了从壮烈的斗争里面开辟了出来的三年以来的血的道路。而且，这声浪又是用非常具体的表现所汇成的，例如，谈到国民党内部的矛盾，就具体地说到熊式辉如何，陈诚如何，杜聿明如何，郑洞国又如何。
    声浪象小河一样文静地流着，没有一点企图使人信服的虚饰的气息，没有一点被胜利信心所膨胀了的兴奋的气息，更不用说某种为了表示自己或不能忘记自己的夸示的气息了。无疑地，这分析的叙述是从党的总结得来的，至少也是根据党的总结引伸出来的。然而，说到具体事实的时候好象是他自己亲自参加过，叙述对那具体事实的理解的时候好象在感觉上经过了无数次的审核，因而说得那么确定，声调达到了那么文静和那么亲切的。
    我们里面有谁问了：
    “现在，全东北都能够丰衣足食了罢？”
    这句话的声音使我感到了一种异样。并不是肯定地以为当然丰衣足食了，用不着问，但还是不免有一种异样之感。或者因为那问法和口气似乎带有外国新闻记者式的气味罢。
    但他似乎没有一点这样的感觉，依然用着文静的声调回答了：
    “还不敢说。北满和南满的情况不一样。在北满，我们初来的时候农民苦得很，有的农民妇女连冬天都没有裤子穿，只好成天登在兀拉草里。毛主席说，中国人民是苦难重重的，真到人民里面去了才懂得这句话的意思。现在，破破烂烂的，总算都穿上了。南满，穿的要好些，但人口密，去年又闹灾荒，有些地方，竭力想了法子才把灾荒渡过，有的还是大半靠豆饼和野菜渡过的。为了节省，去年东北的县级干部，公家只供给十个月，其余两个月要靠自己生产。象驻在这里的一班战士，也都非自己生产不可的…。…”
    我们里面的一位马上有些激动了：
    “啊呀！刚才招待我们吃得那样好，一顿就吃掉了你们好多天，真难为情得很！”
    这话是不必说的，但说了出来以后又好象非说一说不可，刚才的大米饭和四个荤菜马上浮上了我的眼里。
    但他还是用文静的声调说：
    “这一点不算什么。你们走这里过也是难得的。……”（未完）
