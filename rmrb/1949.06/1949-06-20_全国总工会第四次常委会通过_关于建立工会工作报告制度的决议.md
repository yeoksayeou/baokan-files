Xinhua News Agency, Beiping, June 18th:

　　The Fourth Standing Committee of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions passed a resolution on establishing a trade union work reporting system on the 6th. The full text is as follows:

　　In the current victorious situation where the entire country is about to be liberated, in order to ensure that trade unions play an active role in uniting and leading the working class masses in the restoration and development of production, it is necessary to overcome the disconnect that has existed in the past due to years of being in inconvenient rural areas and war environments, where there was no normal communication between trade union organizations and trade union work at different levels. Now that the Northeast and North China have been completely liberated, and Jiangnan and the whole of China are about to be completely liberated, and general transportation is accessible, it is even more imperative that we strengthen and consolidate the organization and discipline of trade unions, and establish and strengthen normal communication between trade unions at different levels. To this end, it is necessary to earnestly implement item B of Article 7 of the Federation's charter: Members of the Federation have the obligation to regularly report on group affairs and individual work to the Federation, so as to ensure that the relationship between trade unions at different levels is sound, and that the leading bodies of trade unions can promptly understand the situation and problems of the workers' movement in various regions, so as to summarize experience and guide the advancement of the movement. To this end, the following decision is made on the establishment of a trade union work reporting system:

　　(1) All levels of trade unions must report important issues concerning the principles and strategies of the labor movement and measures concerning the lives of workers and staff to the higher authorities for instructions at any time, and they can only be implemented after they have been agreed upon and approved.

　　(2) Each industrial trade union and each regional federation of trade unions must submit a comprehensive report to the Standing Committee of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions every two months. The main contents of the report are as follows:

　　(1) Aspects of trade union organization work (including the number of affiliated trade union organizations, trade union members, and trade union cadres at all levels, and their situation);

　　(2) Aspects of cultural and educational work;

　　(3) Aspects of labor protection and welfare work;

　　(4) Aspects of workers' participation in production management and various production movements;

　　(5) Aspects of workers' wages and living standards;

　　(6) Aspects of labor-capital relations in private enterprises;

　　(7) Problems and tendencies that have occurred in the entire workers' movement and various tasks, the reflections and demands of workers and staff on the implementation of policies, and the methods taken to solve these problems, the specific handling process, and the experience and lessons learned.

　　This report must be the responsibility of the standing committee and chairman of each trade union, and the report must be discussed by the standing committee of each trade union. If there are several different opinions, they should also be put forward at the same time, and the problem or focus of the debate should be pointed out. The text of the report should be simple and concise. Except for individual typical report materials, the full text should not exceed 3,000 words. The content of each report should have a focus. If it is not possible to write all the problems in one report, it can be divided into two or three reports, or focus on writing several problems, and leave the secondary problems for the next report. Do not list phenomena in a flat and straightforward manner. Each executive member and alternate executive member of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions has the obligation and responsibility to independently report the situation and state opinions to the Standing Committee of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions or the Chairman of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions.

　　(3) In addition to the above-mentioned comprehensive reports, the materials and reports on specialized issues (such as wages, labor protection, culture and education, cooperatives, etc.) and typical work (such as typical reports from a factory or a profession) of each industrial trade union and each regional federation of trade unions should have special attachments, and they should also regularly report this type of material and summary of typical issues to the All-China Federation of Trade Unions at any time.

　　(4) All instructions, decisions, resolutions, summaries, and replies on policies and strategies issued by each industrial trade union and each regional federation of trade unions to lower levels, regardless of the issue they belong to, must be sent to the All-China Federation of Trade Unions at the same time.

　　(5) All publications of each industrial trade union, each regional federation of trade unions, and all levels of affiliated trade unions (including newspapers, magazines, books, and photographs, etc.) must each be sent in triplicate to the All-China Federation of Trade Unions (unless specifically requested to send more).

　　(6) Specialized reports designated by the Federation to be made by each industrial trade union, each regional federation of trade unions, or a certain trade union, must be submitted strictly in accordance with the designated content and time. If there are difficulties, the All-China Federation of Trade Unions must be consulted in advance and the All-China Federation of Trade Unions must agree before changes can be made.

　　(7) After receiving this decision, each industrial trade union and each regional federation of trade unions should seriously discuss this decision once at the Standing Committee to come up with specific implementation methods. And stipulate that before July 10th, the summary of the discussion and a set of the above-mentioned existing materials should be collected and sorted out, and the first comprehensive report should be sent to the All-China Federation of Trade Unions. It is then stipulated that the 10th of every odd-numbered month is the time to submit a comprehensive report to the All-China Federation of Trade Unions.

　　(8) Methods of sending reports: The prescribed comprehensive reports and important reports other than comprehensive reports, with texts of more than 2,000 words, and land transportation within three days, should all be sent by registered mail through the post office. Texts with less than 2,000 words and land transportation requiring more than three days should be forwarded by local Xinhua News Agency radio stations.

　　(9) After the establishment of the general trade unions and industrial trade unions or their preparatory committees in the newly liberated areas, they must immediately notify the Federation by telegram and establish organizational relations with the Federation in accordance with the above regulations.

　　(10) Each industrial trade union and each regional federation of trade unions must strictly stipulate the reporting system of affiliated trade unions and effectively supervise its implementation.
