Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, June 24th: The Shanghai Student Federation held a city-wide mobilization rally for university, college, and middle school students to go south and serve on the morning of the 21st. Over 300 school units, totaling more than 8,800 people, attended.粟裕 General Su Yu, Deputy Director of the Shanghai Military Control Commission, and 张鼎丞 General Zhang Dingcheng, Head of the Southern Service Corps, were present. Zhang Yumin, Chairman of the Student Federation, said at the meeting: The Preparatory Committee of the New Political Consultative Conference calls on the people of the whole country to eliminate the remaining forces of the Kuomintang reactionaries and unify all of China as quickly as possible. We must cooperate with the People's Liberation Army and undertake this glorious and sacred historical mission. General Su Yu spoke to the students amidst enthusiastic applause. He said: Today, all of China is about to be completely liberated. However, imperialists and Chinese reactionaries will inevitably try their best to sabotage and disrupt us, and we must be vigilant. We must resolutely march south, eliminate the last nest of the reactionaries, and suppress the enemy's sabotage, so that the victory of the people of the whole country can be guaranteed. There is now a lot of work to be carried out urgently in the vast newly liberated areas, and this requires thousands upon thousands of young students to cooperate with the People's Liberation Army and bravely take on this task. Today is the time for students to serve the people with practical actions. Zhang Jinyi, a professor at Fudan University, and Zhou Tanzao, a teacher at Jingye Middle School, used examples from Shanghai before liberation to help students understand the suffering of the broad masses of people in the South and encourage them to join the Southern Service Corps and strengthen their learning in the practical exercise of revolutionary struggle. Chen Zilian, a representative of the parents, said in his speech: "Parents are very honored for their children to participate in the Southern Service. It is a proper move for my children to participate in the revolution." The conference adjourned amidst songs of "We want to go south!" and "Follow the Communist Party!"
