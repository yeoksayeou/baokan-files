　　British Railway Workers
  　"Slow Down" Strike to Fight for Wage Increase
    [Xinhua News Agency, Peiping, 18th] London dispatch: Over 1,300 representatives of the British National Union of Railway Workers, on the night of the 14th, passed a resolution to continue the "slow down" strike. This strike began in the London area on May 30th. The resolution also pointed out that if the Railway Authority does not agree to the workers' demand for a 10-shilling weekly wage increase before July 4th, the workers will begin a work-to-rule strike from that day. At the same time, 8,000 workers at thirty power plants in London issued a strike notice to the National Electricity Board on the 16th, protesting the Board's reduction of workers' weekly wages by ten shillings in the so-called "wage adjustment." In Liverpool, the dockworkers' strike in support of Canadian sailors, after persisting for twenty-seven days, resumed work on the 13th. The strike dealt a heavy blow to the British and Canadian reactionaries. More than seventy cargo ships in the port were unable to set sail due to the strike. The strike by dockworkers in Bristol in support of Canadian sailors is still ongoing.

　　英铁路工人
  　争取增资“放慢”罢工
    【新华社北平十八日电】伦敦讯：英全国铁路工人工会代表一千三百余人，于十四日夜通过继续“放慢”罢工。这一罢工是于五月三十日从伦敦区开始的。决议又指出，如果铁道管理局在七月四日以前不答应工人每周增加工资十先令的要求，工人将从当日起实行怠工。同时，伦敦三十个电力厂的工人八千名，于十六日向全国电力局提出了罢工通知，抗议局方在所谓“工资调整”中，将工人的每周工资削减十先令。在利物浦，码头工人为声援加拿大海员而举行的罢工，于坚持二十七日之后，已于十三日复工。罢工予英加反动派以重大打击。该港七十余艘货轮由于这一罢工而不能启碇。布利斯托码头工人声援加拿大海员的罢工，现仍在坚持中。
