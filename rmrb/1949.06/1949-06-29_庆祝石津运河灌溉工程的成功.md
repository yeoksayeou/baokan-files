　　Celebrating the Success of the Shijin Canal Irrigation Project

　　This newspaper reported on January 18th that the earthwork portion of the first phase of the Shijin Canal irrigation project had been completed. Now, through the efforts of all staff members of the engineering office and the local people, the entire project has been completed and water has begun to be released for irrigation. This is a major event in the production and construction of our North China Liberated Area, and it deserves great celebration.

　　During the War of Resistance Against Japan, in order to divide our Jizhong anti-Japanese base area and plunder the wealth of our working people, Japanese imperialism began forcing the masses to build the canal with bayonets in 1941. The masses suffered terribly and hated them to the bone. With the help and leadership of the Eighth Route Army, they resolutely fought against the enemy, and the enemy's plan to build the canal ultimately failed. After the Japanese surrendered, the Kuomintang reactionaries immediately embezzled materials on a large scale and built fortifications, using the Shijin Canal to encroach on the liberated areas. After the liberation of Shijiazhuang, the People's Government immediately led the broad masses, overcame various difficulties, and started construction at an astonishing speed, quickly turning it into an irrigation project that develops agricultural production and connects the urban and rural economy.

　　The success of this irrigation project shows us that in production and construction, as long as we rely on the strength of the broad masses of the people and link with the interests of the broad masses of the people, there is nothing that cannot be achieved. Our People's Government is actively responsible to the people, and the correct leadership combined with the enthusiasm of the people means that nothing is impossible. The success of the Shijin Canal irrigation project has greatly increased our infinite confidence.

### 庆祝石津运河灌溉工程的成功

　　庆祝石津运河灌溉工程的成功
    今年一月十八日本报曾报导过石津运河灌溉渠第一期工程土工部分完成的消息。现经该工程处全体职工及当地人民的努力，全部工程业已修竣，并开始放水浇地。这是我华北解放区生产建设中的一件大事，值得大大庆贺。
    抗战时期，日本帝国主义为了分割我冀中抗日根据地，掠夺我劳动人民的财富，于一九四一年开始用刺刀逼迫群众修筑，群众惨遭蹂躏，恨之入骨，在八路军帮助与领导下，坚决和敌人进行斗争，敌修筑运河的计划终于失败。日寇投降后，国民党反动派即大肆贪污物资，并修筑碉堡，利用石津运河蚕食解放区。石家庄解放后，人民政府立即领导广大群众，克服种种困难，以惊人速度动工兴修，迅速使之成为发展农业生产，连系城乡经济的灌溉工程。
    这一灌溉工程的成功，启示了我们：在生产建设上，只要依靠广大人民的力量，与广大人民的利益相联系，没有不成功的。我们的人民政府是积极对人民负责的，正确的领导与人民的热情结合起来，是没有任何事情作不到的。石津运河灌溉工程的成功，大大增加了我们无限的信心。
