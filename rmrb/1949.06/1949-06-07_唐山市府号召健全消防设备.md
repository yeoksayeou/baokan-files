[Tangshan Electric] The Tangshan Municipal People's Government issued a circular on the 2nd, calling on all subordinate units to be highly vigilant against fire and to establish sound fire-fighting facilities. In mid-May, two serious fires occurred in Tangshan: one in the state-owned Xinhua Cotton Ginning Factory, which destroyed 18 rooms, 11 cotton ginning machines, and more than 30,000 jin of ginned cotton. The other occurred in the office of the Jidian Tangshan Branch Company. Fortunately, it was discovered early and extinguished in time, avoiding major losses. The circular also called on the broad masses of workers and staff to report illegal elements at any time to protect the property of the people.
