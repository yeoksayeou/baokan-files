    【Suiyuan Telegraph】The Suiyuan Provincial Branch of the People's Bank of China, in accordance with the government's instructions on drought resistance and famine preparedness, and under the principle of public-private partnership, has issued the first batch of loans totaling over two million yuan. It is understood that the bank branch, in order to take into account the interests of both the public and private sectors, has decided to provide loans pegged to real commodities, converting the money into real goods based on the local trading company's price of one "jin" (approximately 500g) of wheat or millet, or one "chi" (approximately 1/3 meter) of white cloth. The loan period is temporarily set at three to six months, and local water conservancy committees are responsible for repayment. If impoverished masses are unable to repay in full by the due date, they can repay in installments. Secondly, before the loan is issued, a detailed plan and a brief chart must be made to ensure that the loan is indeed used for production. Currently, water canals in Quan Yu Ling in Ji Ning, Dou Cheng Shan in Wu Dong County, and Nao Bao in Liangcheng, and other villages have all drawn up plans and submitted them to the bank and the Provincial Department of Construction. Based on the size of the projects, a total of 2,020,000 yuan has been loaned to the above three counties.
