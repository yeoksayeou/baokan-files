　　Reading the Fenyang Self-Criticism

　　After the spirit of the Second Plenary Session of the Party's Seventh Central Committee was conveyed, the Taiyuan Municipal Committee held a special meeting to examine urban work. They deeply understood the basic spirit of the Second Plenary Session by combining it with reality, educating cadres and improving work. The review of urban work presided over by the Jinzhong Second District Committee in late April was a further promotion of this experience. This proves that it is entirely necessary to carry out a systematic urban work inspection with leadership, to correct errors in a timely manner, and to rectify policies in order to better implement the spirit of the Second Plenary Session.

　　A basic lesson of Fenyang's urban work lies in blindly pursuing superficial "prosperity" without understanding what prosperity means, who prospers, for whom it prospers, who to rely on, and how to achieve prosperity. As a result, it inevitably led to speculative merchants selling short and buying long, hoarding, abandoning the leadership of the people's democratic regime and the state-owned economy, and even allowing the state-owned economy and some government departments to be used by unscrupulous merchants and bad elements to achieve their own kind of prosperity. The comrades in Fenyang work misunderstood the protection and development of industry and commerce as restoring the deformed prosperity of the old city before the war, which is completely wrong. Our urban work policy must be to transform consumer cities into productive cities, and the primary task of our party in cities is to restore and develop production. Our comrades must devote all their efforts to leading production, learning production technology and methods of managing production, and learn about commerce, banking, and other work closely related to production. All work should revolve around production and construction and serve this central task. Only in this way can we improve the lives of workers and the general public and achieve genuine people's prosperity that benefits the national economy and the people's livelihood. Without this, there is no such thing as a city that belongs to the people.

　　To restore and develop production, it is necessary to "rely on the working class, unite other working people, win over intellectuals, and win over as many members of the liberal bourgeoisie and their representatives as possible," among which the first priority is to rely wholeheartedly on the working class.

　　When Fenyang's working comrades entered the city last July, they organized pauper groups, the Federation of Industry and Commerce, and neighborhood offices. However, they did not think to find the working masses, who accounted for 3.5 percent of the city's population, and mobilize and organize them to participate in production and urban management. They were deceived by some superficial phenomena and believed that they "couldn't find workers," and used this as a reason to "rely on the poor or some upper-class elements." This erroneous tendency also existed in other places at the time. The North China Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China severely criticized this, calling on cadres to stand firm and consciously return to the ranks (i.e., return to the ranks of the urban proletariat). Shijiazhuang, Jixian, and other places have corrected their policies with the help of the Central Bureau, and some have even made better achievements. However, all of this failed to arouse the attention of the Fenyang working comrades. The press release of the Second Plenary Session of the Party's Seventh Central Committee had been issued for a long time, but they failed to quickly correct it based on the central policy. It was not until this inspection that they made a systematic review. As a result, Fenyang's urban work suffered many undue losses over a long period. This shows that establishing ties with the working class in thought, action, and emotion, and further relying on the working class, is not an easy task, but a arduous process of struggle and transformation. The comrades in Fenyang work did not earnestly study and implement the Party's policies, nor did they arm themselves ideologically and theoretically, or improve their class consciousness and ability. This is the main root of making mistakes. On the other hand, it also proves that the issuance and implementation of a policy is not easy. This requires the leadership to help cadres understand the Party's policies from all aspects in a timely manner, patiently and thoroughly persuade and explain, forcefully inspect and promote, strictly adhere to organizational discipline, improve the system of requesting instructions and reporting, and correct any deviations as soon as they occur, without allowing them to develop.

　　The advantage of the Fenyang urban work review is that it has grasped the basic key. Only by solving the central task of restoring and developing production and the basic principle of relying on the working class to unite other working people and fully cooperate with various democratic strata can our cities embark on a path of sound development. However, while solving this basic problem, we must also prevent the emergence of a deviation, which is not "only the working class, but no one else." It should be recognized that relying on the working class is by no means isolated or one-sided. We should unite all working people and as many members of the liberal bourgeoisie as possible. Only in this way can we conform to the "all-round" line indicated by Chairman Mao, which is indispensable. At the same time, the partial achievements in Fenyang's implementation of urban policies should also be comprehensively assessed. However, we must fundamentally correct their mistakes and educate them to prevent another extreme of one-sidedness, and educate all comrades with correct and comprehensive thinking to thoroughly improve their work.

### 读汾阳检讨

　　读汾阳检讨
    党的二中全会精神下达后，太原市委会曾召开专门会议检查城市工作，结合实际深刻体会了党的二中全会的基本精神，教育了干部改进了工作。四月下旬晋中二地委所主持的对于城市工作的检讨，正是这一经验的进一步推广。由此证明，开展一个有领导的系统的城市工作检查，及时纠正错误端正政策，以便更好地贯澈二中全会的精神，是完全必要的。
    汾阳城市工作一个基本教训，在于只是盲目地追求表面“繁荣”，却不懂得什么叫做繁荣、繁荣了谁、为谁繁荣、依靠谁与如何达到繁荣的道理。因而其结果也便不可避免地造成了投机商人卖空买空、囤积居奇，放弃人民民主政权及国营经济的领导，甚至使国营经济以及政府若干部门，都被利用来做为奸商及坏分子达到他们自己的另一种繁荣。汾阳工作的同志，他们把保护与发展工商业误解为恢复战前旧城市的畸形繁荣，这是完全错误的。我们城市工作方针，必须是变消费城市为生产城市，我党在城市的第一位工作就是恢复与发展生产。我们的同志必须用全力领导生产，学习生产技术和管理生产的方法，学会和生产密切关联的商业、银行工作及其他工作。使一切工作均围绕着生产建设这一中心工作并为这个中心工作服务，也只有如此，才能改善工人和一般人民的生活，达到有益于国计民生的真正的人民的繁荣，离开了这一点，就说不上为人民所有的城市。
    恢复与发展生产，必须“依靠工人阶级，团结其他劳动群众，争取知识分子，争取尽可能多的自由资产阶级及其代表人物”，其中首先要全心全意依靠工人阶级。
    去年七月入城，汾阳的工作同志曾组织了贫民团，工商联合会以及街公所，可是他们却不懂得去找一找占该城人口百分之三点五的工人群众，发动和组织他们来参加生产管理城市，他们被一些表面的现象所迷惑，竟认为是“找不到工人”，并以此来作为“依靠贫民或某些上层分子”的理由。这种错误倾向，当时在其他地方也同样存在，中共中央华北局曾为此提出了严厉的批评，号召干部站稳立场自觉归队（即回到城市无产阶级队伍中去），石家庄、汲县等地均在中央局帮助下摆正了方针，有的更做出较好的成绩，可是这一切却没有能够唤起汾阳工作同志应有的注意，党的二中全会新闻发布已久，他们也未能依据中央方针迅速纠正，及至这一次的检查，才作了系统的检讨，这样使汾阳城市工作在较长时期内受到许多不应有的损失，由此可见从思想上行动上情感上建立与工人阶级连系，进一步依靠工人阶级并不是一件容易的事，而是一个艰苦的斗争与转变的过程。汾阳工作同志没有认真研究与执行党的方针，没有从理论上思想上武装自己，提高自己的阶级觉悟和能力，这是犯错误的主要根源，另一方面也证明了一个政策的下达和贯彻同样是不容易的，这须要领导上及时地帮助干部从各方面了解党的政策，耐心深入地说服解释，有力地检查和推动，严格组织性纪律性，健全请示报告制度，一出偏向，即予纠正，而不可使其有所发展。
    汾阳城市工作的检讨的好处在于它抓住了基本关键，只有解决了恢复与发展生产的中心任务以及依靠工人阶级团结其他劳动人民充分地同各民主阶层合作的基本道理，我们的城市才会走上健全发展的道路。但与解决这一基本问题同时，也还要防止一个偏向的产生，这不是“只要工人阶级，而不要其他”，应当认识依靠工人阶级绝不是孤立的片面的，应该团结一切劳动群众，团结尽可能多的自由资产阶级，如此方能符合于毛主席所指示的“四面八方”，缺一不可的路线。同时对汾阳执行城市政策中的部分成绩，也应加以全面估计，但必须从基本上纠正其错误，并教育他们同时防止另一极端的片面性，教育全体同志以正确的全面的思想，彻底改进工作。
