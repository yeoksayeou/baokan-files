    Episode Thirteen: Exploring the Tiger's Den (Continued)
    Inside, Shen Yaozong was lying next to the opium lamp; his concubine was opposite him, preparing his pipe. When Shen Yaozong saw Niu Dashui enter with a box cannon, his face changed. He sat up sideways and said, "Captain Niu, why have you come! Where are you from?" Niu Dashui told him not to get up, saying, "You smoke first, we'll talk after you've had enough." Shen Yaozong hurriedly got off the kang, saying, "I've had enough. Please sit down! I'm so sorry, I just do these worthless things." Dashui saw that he didn't have a gun, so he closed the safety on his box cannon.

    The lacquered furniture and the large and small glass mirrors in the room were all shining, decorated quite elegantly. Niu Dashui was dressed very shabbily. He picked a chair to sit on and put the gun on the table. Shen Yaozong hurriedly told his concubine to boil water; the concubine, in her panic, had already wet her pants; now she braced herself to get up, her legs trembling as she went to leave. Dashui said, "Don't go! I don't want to drink!" The concubine didn't dare to move. Dashui told Shen Yaozong to sit down and asked him, "Who are in your rooms?" Shen Yaozong said, "My daughter-in-law is in the east room, my mother and wife are in the west room, no guests." Niu Dashui said, "Call them all in here!"

    Shen Yaozong obediently walked out, Dashui following him, taking the opportunity to bolt the front door. He brought the whole family to the main room. They trembled and asked, "Have you eaten?" Dashui said, "I've eaten and drunk my fill, I just want to talk about something. The Eighth Route Army doesn't kill people indiscriminately, don't be afraid!" The women sat down. Dashui, like giving a lesson, talked to them about the international situation, domestic current affairs, and the united front, all mixed together. Whether they understood or not, they all nodded and hummed in agreement. Finally, Dashui said to Shen Yaozong, "Old Shen, do you think what I said is right?" Shen Yaozong quickly said, "Every word is the truth!" Dashui said, "Good. We are all Chinese, we must stick together and fight the Japanese. You work in the big village, I want to know the situation on the watchtowers, do you dare to tell me?"

    Shen Yaozong was a cat-eyed man, adapting to the situation; he said, "We are all Chinese, how dare I not say? It's hard to digest the food I eat in this job. Can a Chinese be of one heart with the Japanese?" He then told him the number of people on the watchtowers, the guns, the names of the officers, the methods of the secret agents… He also asked Dashui, "See, am I lying?"

    Dashui nodded and said, "It's pretty close. To be honest with you: what you're doing is too dangerous! The Eighth Route Army sees that you've forgotten you're Chinese, and originally decided to attack you..." Shen Yaozong was so scared his scalp was tingling, and he quickly said, "Captain Niu, my heart is with the Han, even though I'm in Cao's camp!" Dashui said, "That's good. The Eighth Route Army has always had a lenient policy, as long as you atone for your crimes, you can be treated leniently, and you can still have your place after the victory. You are a big village chief, and the people of several villages are in your hands. You can only superficially obey the enemy, but you must be on the side of the Chinese in your heart and work for the people." Shen Yaozong quickly said, "Yes, yes, yes! As long as I can do it, I will do my best, I will do my best."

    Dashui then talked to him about how to find a way to release the village head. Shen Yaozong scratched his head and said, "Captain Niu, this is an order from the Japanese, I can't do anything about it... but... since you brought it up, no matter how difficult it is, I will naturally have to find a way to achieve the goal." Dashui said, "You have to hurry!" Shen Yaozong said, "I'll go tomorrow."

    After talking for a while, Dashui said, "It's getting late, let's rest." Shen Yaozong asked, "Where are you staying?" Dashui said, "I'm staying in your house, I have to sleep with you." Shen Yaozong thought for a moment and said, "I'm afraid someone from the watchtower will come, let's sleep in the small suite inside." Dashui said, "Okay. Your whole family has to sleep in this outer room, no one is allowed to go out. If the enemy comes looking for you, say you're not home."

    Shen Yaozong's family all slept on a large kang in the outer room. Dashui and Shen Yaozong slept in the small suite; one at the east end, one at the west end. The kang was covered with a large red felt; embroidered pillows, slippery silk quilt; how could Dashui fall asleep? He was calculating in his mind and making decisions in his belly; he was also afraid that Shen Yaozong would secretly run out to call people, and he was also afraid that the enemy would break in. He used his gun as a pillow, pretending to be asleep, but his ears were listening for any movement. Shen Yaozong didn't fall asleep either, he had several scales, large and small, in his belly, actively weighing the pros and cons. The rooster crowed, and Shen Yaozong fell asleep. Dashui was still thinking it over and over in his mind.

    As soon as it dawned, Niu Dashui got up and pushed Shen Yaozong awake, saying, "Old Shen, what if the enemy comes looking for you?" Shen Yaozong jumped up and got off the kang, and walked out. Dashui asked him, "Where are you going?" He said, "I'm going to relieve myself." Dashui said, "I need to relieve myself too." So he followed him out.

    Soon, the whole family got up and busied themselves boiling water and making food. Shen Yaozong poured Dashui water for washing his face and rinsing his mouth. Dashui said, "Wash up quickly and go. I don't have a toothbrush or toothpaste, I'll just wash casually." Shen Yaozong put on a long gown and a top hat. Dashui said to him, "Go and handle that matter well. I'm waiting for your news. If you call the enemy to arrest me, your whole family's lives are guaranteed. I'm just one life, if I can't live, your whole family won't be able to escape!" Shen Yaozong said, "I'm still Chinese after all, you just wait and see!" And then he went out.

    Dashui, wearing ragged clothes, sat in the main room. Shen Yaozong's mother said, "Don't stay here, go hide in the inner room." Dashui thought to himself, "I won't go!" He stood up and said, "I'll sweep the yard for you." He took a large broom and swept the yard for a while; then he went to the outer courtyard south room and helped them feed the livestock. He thought to himself, "Hey, this is a good place; I'm guarding the gate here, no one can get out! In case Shen Yaozong brings people to arrest me, he won't suspect that I'm in the south room."

    He fed the mule and then the ox; he watched the big yellow ox chewing grass with its mouth, and he loved it immensely. He stroked the ox's neck, thinking how great it would be to have an ox to plow the fields! The old woman who worked for Shen Yaozong brought the meal, which was white flour pancakes, scrambled eggs, and sliced noodle soup. Dashui said, "Quickly take it back, can people who are working eat such food?" The old woman said embarrassedly, "It's already made, are we making something else?" Dashui was afraid that someone would come, so he quickly finished eating. He waited in the south room until noon, but there was still no movement. The old woman brought dumplings again. Dashui said, "The Eighth Route Army has always eaten two meals, I'm not hungry right now." He told her to take them back.

    In the afternoon, he heard the front door ring. Dashui secretly hid near the window of the south room, and saw Shen Yaozong returning. He was carrying two large carp in his hand, and went straight to the inner courtyard. Dashui quickly lay down on the straw pile, pretending to be asleep. After a while, Shen Yaozong came in and pushed him, saying, "You're really brave, still sleeping!" Dashui got up and said with a smile, "I believe you, this is coming to a safe place." Shen Yaozong said happily, "Good, you're a good friend! Let's go inside and talk." Dashui said, "The people on the watchtower aren't looking for you?" Shen Yaozong said, "They won't come, they're playing cards."

    The two went to the north room and sat down. Dashui asked how things were going, and Shen Yaozong stroked his mustache, and said proudly, "Ha! I used a delaying tactic on him! I said to the Japanese captain: 'Taijun! Seeing that the seven-day deadline has arrived, if we really kill the village head, we'll get a bad reputation and won't get any benefit; it's better to send the village head back, so that they can work with peace of mind and urge the grain for us; firstly, it will show that the Imperial Army is benevolent, and secondly, if there is a person in charge in the village, we will also have someone to catch.' I also lobbied the translator to help, and with the two sides working together, haha, it was a great success! The Japanese captain agreed to send them back tomorrow. Captain Niu, what do you think of how I handled this matter?"

    Dashui nodded and praised him a few words. Shen Yaozong then made a big turn, saying, "Now that this hurdle is over, what if we can't hand in the grain in the future?" Dashui said with a smile, "Now that we've taken this step, we'll talk about that step later. Let's drag it out first, and if we can't drag it out, we'll think of a way to deal with it, isn't that okay?" Shen Yaozong thought for a while, and had no choice but to laugh and say, "Okay, okay, let's do it that way." Dashui said, "Do a good job! Anyway, you know the difficulties of the people."

    At dusk, Shen Yaozong invited Dashui to dinner again, eating white flour dumplings and braised carp. Dashui frowned and said, "Ah, this... life is too corrupt! It's all the blood and sweat of the people..." Shen Yaozong said embarrassedly, "It's rare for you to eat these things, just have a meal. This is also a little bit of my respect for the Eighth Route Army!"

    Dashui ate while talking to him about the principles of resisting the enemy, and also agreed on a way to contact him in the future. When everyone had gone to sleep, Dashui said, "Old Shen, I should go back, you walk me for a while." Shen Yaozong thought for a moment and said, "Okay. If you meet someone, don't say anything, I'll deal with it." Dashui put his gun in his pocket and followed Shen Yaozong to the outside of the village. Shen Yaozong then went back.

    The moon had already risen. Dashui walked to Sun Gong Dyke, and under a large willow tree on the dike slope, he whistled, and a small boat emerged from the reed pond with a soft creak. A fifteen or sixteen-year-old child on the stern of the boat, rowing with an oar, quickly approached the shore. The child asked with a smile, "Brother, did it work?" Dashui said, "It worked, it worked!" He jumped on the boat. The small boat turned around and darted into Da Dian; in an instant, it became a black spot, hidden by the night mist.

    Dashui, holding a gun, broke into Shen Yaozong's room.

    新儿女英雄传
    袁静  孔厥
    第十三回  探虎穴（续）
    里面，申耀宗正躺在烟灯跟前；他的小婆躺在他对面，正给他装烟呢。申耀宗瞧见牛大水端着盒子枪进来，脸上变了色儿，一侧歪坐起来说：“牛队长，怎么你来了！打哪儿来？”牛大水叫他不用起来，说：“你先抽吧，抽足了咱们再谈。”申耀宗忙着下炕，说：“我抽足了。你请坐！真对不起，我尽作些没出息的事儿。”大水见他没有枪，就把手里的盒子枪关上小机头，保了险。
    屋里油漆的家具，和大大小小的玻璃镜，都亮闪闪的，布置得挺讲究。牛大水穿得很破烂，拣个椅子坐下，把枪放在桌子上。申耀宗忙叫小婆去烧水；小婆刚才一急，一泡尿早撒在裤子里；这会儿硬撑着起来，抖着腿儿要出去。大水说：“别走！我不喝！”小婆就不敢动。大水叫申耀宗坐下来，问他：“你那东西屋里是谁们？”申耀宗说：“东屋是我儿妇，西屋是我母亲和内人，没有外客。”牛大水说：“把他们都叫到这儿来！”
    申耀宗依顺的走出去，大水跟着他，顺便去把大门插上，一家人都带到上房来了。她们抖抖擞擞的问：“吃饭了没？”大水说：“我饭也吃过了，水也喝过了，就谈个事儿。八路军不乱杀人，你们别害怕！”女人们坐下来了。大水就象上课似的，杂七杂八，给他们讲了一顿国际形势、国内时事、和统一战线。他们不管听懂听不懂，都哼呀哈的点头。末了，大水对申耀宗说：“老申，你看我讲的对不对？”申耀宗忙说：“这可句句都是实话！”大水说：“好。咱们都是中国人，得抱成堆儿，团成个儿，跟日本人干。你在大乡上办事，我想知道知道岗楼上的情形，你敢不敢跟我说？”
    申耀宗是个猫儿眼，看时候变；他说：“咱们都是中国人，怎么不敢说？我吃这碗饭也是好吃难消化。一个中国人，还能跟日本人一条心？”就把岗楼上的人数、枪支、军官的姓名、特务活动的办法………都说了。又问大水：“你看，我说的有虚吗？”
    大水点头说：“倒还差不多。老实告诉你：你干这事儿，太危险！八路军看你忘了是个中国人，本来决定是要打你的………”申耀宗吓得脑皮子直炸，忙着说：“牛队长，我可是人在曹营心在汉啊！”大水说：“这就好。八路军向来是宽大政策，只要你将功折罪，就可以宽大你，胜利以后还能有你的地位。你是个大乡长，几个村的老百姓，都在你手里攒着。你只可以表面上应敌，心里可得向着中国人，给老百姓办事。”申耀宗忙说：“是是是！只要我办得到，一定尽力而为之，一定尽力而为之。”
    大水就和他谈，叫他想法子把保长放出来。申耀宗搔着头皮说：“牛队长，这可是日本人下的命令，我也做不了主……不过……既然你提出来，再怎么千难万难，我自然总得想办法，达到目的。”大水说：“你可得快些！”申耀宗说：“我明天就去。”
    谈了一会儿，大水说：“时候不早，咱们歇了吧。”申耀宗问：“你住在哪儿？”大水说：“就住在你家里，我还得跟你一块儿睡。”申耀宗想了想，说：“怕岗楼上有人来，咱俩就在这里面小套间睡吧。”大水说：“行喽。你一家可得在这外间睡，谁也别出去。要是敌人来找你，就说你没在家。”
    申耀宗一家人，都在外间屋一个大炕上睡。大水和申耀宗两个睡在小套间里；一个在东头，一个在西头。炕上铺的大红毡；绣花枕头，滑溜溜的绸被子；大水可哪里睡得着？他心里打算盘，肚里拿主意；又怕申耀宗偷偷跑出去叫人，还怕敌人闯得来。他枕着枪，假装睡熟了，耳朵可听着动静。申耀宗也没睡着，他肚子里大大小小几杆秤，正在称斤约两的活动呢。鸡叫了，申耀宗睡着了。大水心里还是琢磨来，琢磨去。
    四
    天一发明，牛大水就起来推醒申耀宗，说：“老申，要是敌人来找你怎么办？”申耀宗一骨碌起来，下了炕就往外走。大水问他：“你到哪儿去？”他说：“我去解个手。”大水说：“我也要解手。”就跟着他出去。
    一会儿，一家人都起来了，忙着烧水作饭。申耀宗给牛大水舀洗脸水漱口水。大水说：“你快洗了走吧。我也没有牙刷牙粉，随便洗洗就得了。”申耀宗穿了长袍，戴上礼帽。大水跟他说：“你去好好办那件事。我等着你的信儿。要是你叫敌人来抓我，你一家人性命担保。我不过是一条命，我活不了，你一家人也跑不了！”申耀宗说：“我怎么也是个中国人，你等着瞧吧！”就出门去了。
    大水穿着破衣裳，坐在堂屋里。申耀宗的娘说：“你别待在这儿了，你上里间屋躲着去吧。”大水心里想：“我才不去哩！”他站起来说：“我给你们扫院子吧。”就拿着个大笤帚，扫了一阵院子；又到外院南屋里，帮他们喂牲口。心里盘算：“嘿，这可是个好地方；我在这儿把着大门，谁也出不去！万一申耀宗带人来抓我，他可不提防我在南屋里。”
    他喂了骡子又喂牛；看着那大黄牛努着嘴儿嚼草，爱得不行。他抚摩着牛脖子，想着有个牛耕地够多么好呀！申耀宗家使唤的老婆儿把饭端来，是白面烙饼、炒鸡子儿、和片儿汤。大水说：“赶快端回去，作活的还能吃这样的饭？”老婆儿为难的说：“已经作好了，还另作呀？”大水怕有人来，紧着吃完。在南屋一直等到晌午，还不见动静。老婆儿又端来饺子。大水说：“八路军向来就吃两顿饭，这会儿不饿。”叫端回去了。
    后半晌，听见大门响了。大水暗暗隐在南屋的窗户跟前，瞧见申耀宗回来了。他手里提着两条大鲤鱼，直往里院走。大水忙躺在草堆上，假装睡着了。一会儿，申耀宗进来推他说：“胆子真不小啊，还睡觉呢！”大水起来，笑着说：“我可相信你，这是来到保险的地方啦。”申耀宗高兴的说：“好，够朋友啦！咱们到里面说话吧。”大水说：“岗楼上的人不来找你？”申耀宗说：“不会来了，他们打牌呢。”
    两个人到了北屋，坐下来。大水问事情办得怎么样了，申耀宗捻着八字胡，得意的说：“哈！我给他使了个缓兵——之计！我跟日本队长说：‘太君！眼看七天的日期到了，咱们要真的把保长杀了，干落个坏名誉，还得不到好处；倒不如把保长放回去，叫他们安心工作，好好儿给咱们催粮；一来显得皇军仁慈，二来村里有个负责人，咱也有个抓的。’我又运动翻译官帮着敲边鼓，两下里一夹攻，哈哈，就大功——告成啦！日本队长答应明天就放他们回去。牛队长，你看这事儿我办得怎么样？”
    大水点点头，称赞了他几句。申耀宗可又来了个大转弯，说：“这一关过去了，将来要再交不上粮可怎么办？”大水笑着说：“作了这一步，再说那一步么。咱们先给他拖，拖不下去，再想办法对付，不行啊？”申耀宗想了想，也只好这样，没奈何的笑着说：“行喽行喽，就这么吧。”大水说：“你好好儿干吧！反正老百姓的困难，你也知道。”
    傍黑，申耀宗又请大水吃饭，吃的是白面饺子，红烧鲤鱼。大水皱着眉头说：“啊呀，这……生活太腐化啦！都是老百姓的血汗……”申耀宗不好意思的说：“你难得吃这些，就吃一顿吧。这也是我优待八路军的一点意思！”
    大水一面吃，一面和他谈应敌的原则，又跟他约定以后联络的办法。等到人们都睡下了，大水说：“老申，我该回去了，你送我一段路吧。”申耀宗想了一下，说：“行。如果碰见人，你别言声，我来应付。”大水揣好了枪，跟着申耀宗，来到村外。申耀宗就回去了。
    月亮已经上来。大水走到孙公堤，在堤坡上一棵大柳树底下，打了个唿哨，苇塘里就咿哑一声，钻出个小船来。船梢上一个十五六岁的孩子，打着棹，飞快的傍了岸。孩子笑着问：“大哥，成了吗？”大水说：“成了成了！”一跳就上了船。小船掉过头，往大淀里窜去；一刹时，就成了个黑点儿，给夜雾隐没了。
                  （未完）（附图片）
    大水端着枪，闯进申耀宗的屋里。
