　　Jinnan Dispatch: The sowing of economic crops in the Jinnan region has been completed, and a weeding, watering, and seedling protection campaign is continuing. Most of the seedlings have now emerged, but due to drought, frequent winds, and continuous pest infestations, the seedlings in various areas, especially cotton and peanuts, are experiencing dieback after emergence. Therefore, various localities have successively shifted to weeding, watering, and seedling protection work. The county committees of Ningnan, Pingxiang, and other counties in the Fourth Special District have instructed all districts to vigorously protect seedlings, on the one hand continuing to organize the masses to dig soil wells, repair old wells, and build more waterwheels to water the seedlings with pit water; on the other hand, organizing the masses to weed the cotton seedlings first. Daming, Wei County, Guangping and other counties in the Third Special District are striving to ensure that the seedlings that have been sown are preserved. Daming is currently carrying out a "one seedling, one pot of water" watering campaign. Wei County is also finding it very effective to use reed tubes inserted next to the cotton seedlings to water them. In order to prevent the soil from being exposed to the wind, farmers in various places are mostly adopting the method of loosening the soil around the seedlings with hoes. The slogan in the Second and Fifth Special Districts is "Completing the task means ensuring that the seedlings do not die!" After discovering that the existing cotton seedlings in the Second District of Zaoqiang were drying out due to insufficient watering, village cadres in each village have led the masses into a heat wave of replanting and weeding. They have confidently put forward: "Plant more, emerge evenly, weed diligently, and harvest well."

　　大力进行保苗
  　冀南开展锄苗浇苗运动
    【冀南电】冀南全区经济作物播种已经完成，正继续开展锄苗、浇苗、保苗运动。现小苗大部出土，但由于天旱多风和虫害的不断发生，各地小苗，特别是棉花、花生都发生出土后又死的回苗现象。因此，各地已先后转入锄苗、浇苗、保苗工作。四专区宁南、平乡等县县委，指示各区大力进行保苗，一方面继续组织群众挖土井、修旧井、增修水车，用坑水浇苗；一方面组织群众先锄棉苗。三分区大名、魏县、广平等县争取做到已点种的，保证保住苗。大名现正开展“一棵苗一壶水”的浇苗运动。魏县用苇筒插在棉苗边浇水，也很收效。为了使土不透风，各地农民多采用把苗周围用锄锄松的办法。二、五专区的口号是“保苗不死才算完成任务！”枣强二区自发现有的棉苗因浇水少而干死的现象后，各村村干已领导群众卷入补苗、锄苗热潮。并满有信心的提出：“种的多、出的齐、锄的勤、收的好。”
