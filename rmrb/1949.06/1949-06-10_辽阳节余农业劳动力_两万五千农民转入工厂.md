　　Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 8th. Due to the development of industrial and mining production, and the organization of agricultural labor leading to surpluses, over the past few months, more than 25,000 farmers around the Liaoyang industrial area in Liaodong Province have laid down their plows and taken up work in factories. This is a noteworthy new phenomenon in the economic development of Northeast China. Some of these farmers had worked in factories in the past, but became unemployed after the factories and mines were destroyed by the Japanese invaders and the Kuomintang, and then turned to rural areas, where they were allocated land during the land reform. After the land reform, farmers engaged in farming through mutual aid work teams, improving production efficiency compared to the past, thus freeing up labor for other production. For example, a mutual aid team in Songquansi Village, Anping District, Liaoyang County, consisting of six households with more than 70 mu of land and nine male laborers, calculated that they could allocate four laborers to farm at home, two to work in the mines, and three to engage in commerce, thus avoiding labor waste and increasing income to improve their lives. In Songquansi Village alone, out of more than 200 laborers, over 60 have transferred to work in the mines. According to surveys, Liaoyang County has more than 1.8 million mu of arable land and over 120,000 male laborers. If each laborer cultivates 20 mu of land, only over 90,000 people are needed to complete the county's farming, leaving more than 30,000 laborers free to completely leave agriculture and participate in other production. If we include the large number of women participating in agricultural production, even more labor can be drawn from rural areas to engage in other production.

### 辽阳节余农业劳动力　两万五千农民转入工厂

　　辽阳节余农业劳动力　两万五千农民转入工厂
    【新华社沈阳八日电】由于工矿生产的发展与农业劳动力在组织起来后有了节余，辽东省辽阳工业区周围最近数月有两万五千余农民放下犁耙，转入工厂。这是东北经济发展中值得注意的新现象之一。这些农民中有些过去即在工厂做工，后因工厂矿山为日寇及国民党破坏而失业，乃转入农村，并在土地改革中分得土地。土地改革后，农民们以变工互助从事耕作，生产效率较前提高，因此能节余劳动力从事其他生产。例如辽阳县安平区松泉寺村的一个互助组，共有六户，有土地七十多亩，男劳动力九个，他们经过计算，即以四个劳动力在家种地，两个人进矿山，三个人做买卖，这样劳动力既不浪费，又可多增加收入，改善生活。松泉寺一个村共有二百多个劳动力，转入矿山做工的有六十多人。据调查，辽阳全县有耕地一百八十多万亩，有男劳动力十二万余人。如按每一劳动力种地二十亩计算，全县耕地只需九万多人即可完成耕作，尚有三万多劳动力可完全脱离农业参加其他生产。如将大批参加农业生产的妇女计入，则农村中可以抽出更多劳动力从事其他生产。
