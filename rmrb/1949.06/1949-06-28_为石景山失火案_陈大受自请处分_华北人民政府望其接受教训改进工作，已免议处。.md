　　For the Fire at Shijingshan
  　Chen Dashou Requests Punishment
　  North China People's Government Hopes He Will Learn from the Experience and Improve His Work, Deciding Against Punishment.
    [This Newspaper] The handling of the fire in the laboratory of the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant was reported in a previous dispatch. Chen Dashou, General Manager of the North China Iron and Steel Company, submitted a request to the Public Enterprise Department for severe punishment, stating that as the iron and steel plant was under the jurisdiction of the North China Iron and Steel Company and he was responsible as General Manager, he had been negligent in his leadership prior to the fire and failed to make thorough preparations with the plant's responsible personnel, thus failing in his duties. The North China People's Government, after receiving the report, replied that Chen Dashou should indeed bear the responsibility for failing to detect the fire hazard, but considering that he had just taken office and had already made a deep self-criticism, it was decided to waive punishment. It is hoped that he will accept this experience and lesson, and earnestly rectify and improve the work of all subordinate plants to prevent similar accidents from happening again.

    【本报讯】石景山钢铁厂化验室失火案处理情形已志本报前讯。华北钢铁公司总经理陈大受，以该钢铁厂属华北钢铁公司管辖，本人身负总经理任务，对此次失火事件事前疏于领导，未能与该厂主管人员做周密预防，有亏职守，特呈请公营企业部严加议处。华北人民政府据呈后批复，以陈大受对该失火事件固应负失察之责，惟念其接任伊始，既已深做检讨，应免议处。望即接受此次经验教训，认真整顿与改进所属各厂工作，以免再有意外事件发生。
