Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 5th: Budapest dispatch: French imperialists are exploiting German prisoners of war to deal with the Vietnamese people who are fighting for their freedom. A German soldier named Liller said in a letter to his fiancée: At the end of the war, I was captured by the French army. I didn't want to starve to death in a concentration camp, so I joined the Foreign Legion. I have been fighting in Vietnam for two years, but I still don't see when the war will end. Another German soldier, Stampfer, wrote in a letter: All the members of our detachment are German. The commander is also German. We either behead or dismember the Viet Minh soldiers. Manstrich wrote in a letter to his sister in Berlin: "Ninety percent of the French Foreign Legion are Germans."

　　法帝侵略越南竟利用德俘
    【新华社北平五日电】布达佩斯讯：法国帝国主义者利用德国战俘来对付争取自由的越南人民。德国兵利勒在写给他未婚妻的信中说：战争结束时，我即为法军俘掳。我不愿饿死在集中营而去参加外国军团。在越南已经打了两年，但仍然看不到战争什么时候能了结。另一个德国兵斯坦普弗尔写信称：在我们的支队里全都是德国人。指挥官也是德国人。我们对越军不是将他们杀头，就是肢解他们。曼斯特里契在给他在柏林的姊姊的信中称：“法国国外军团中的百分之九十都是德国人。”
