　　Pingshan Women Earn Good Wages Repairing Canals
    [Chahar News] Pingshan District One has a lot of watery land, and canals need to be repaired every spring. In the past, canal repairs were done by men, but this year not only did a large number of women participate, but they also earned the same wages as men. For example, forty-two women from Qudi Village participated in canal repairs. Among them, Qi Qi's and eight others averaged forty-nine workdays each, and each person should receive 147 jin of wheat in wages. Twenty-eight women from the West Street Guan in Pingshan City participated in canal repairs, and twelve of them even organized a mutual aid challenge competition. Each person worked twelve days, earning sixty jin of wheat.

　　平山妇女修渠挣得不少工资
    【察哈尔讯】平山一区多水地，每年春天要修渠。往年修渠都是男人，今年不但有大批妇女参加，还和男人挣一样的工价。如曲堤村四十二名妇女参加修渠，其中祁齐氏等九人平均每人作了四十九个工，每人应得工资一百四十七斤小麦。平山城西街关二十八名妇女参加修渠，其中十二个人还组织互助挑战竞赛。每人做工十二个，挣得小麦六十斤。
