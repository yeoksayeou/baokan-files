Ministry of Railways Instructs All Railway Administrations
　　Stop Passengers from Climbing on Train Roofs
　　[This newspaper dispatch] To ensure the safety of passengers and trains, the Military Commission's Ministry of Railways issued a circular to all Northern Railway Administrations on June 20, pointing out that strict inspections should be carried out. If any passengers are found climbing on the train roof or squatting on the footboards of the train cars under the pretext of cooling off due to the hot weather, stationmasters, train attendants, and public security personnel should be responsible for politely persuading and stopping them to enter the train car, so as to avoid accidents.
