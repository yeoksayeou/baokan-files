Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, May 31st: Before the liberation of Shanghai, many enterprise workers carried out heroic struggles against the Kuomintang gangster's migration and destruction efforts. Some workers even armed themselves and cooperated with the People's Liberation Army (PLA) in combat upon their arrival, thus preserving much machinery, resources, and buildings. The Kuomintang gangsters attempted to move the Jiangnan Shipyard, the largest in the country, to Taiwan. Gui gangster Yongqing specially ordered the relocation to be completed before May 15th, and sent the Second Division of the Marine Corps and military secret agent Chu Wensi to lead a guard battalion stationed at the factory to forcibly dismantle and transport equipment. However, the workers, engineers, and staff of the shipyard united and refused to transport newly built and repaired ships. The gangsters, helpless, had to send the guard battalion to carry out the task. When the gangsters wanted to dismantle machine parts, the workers tried to keep the good and important ones, only giving them old and damaged parts. During loading, the workers deliberately loaded things irregularly, so that a ship capable of carrying 3,000 tons could only load 1,000 tons before it became impossible to load more. Engineers hid important technical charts and gave some useless or secondary ones to the gangsters. The gangsters also used threats and inducements to force engineers and workers to go to Taiwan, but out of nearly 4,000 employees in the shipyard, only about 200 went to Taiwan. Many engineers were hidden with the help of the workers, avoiding abduction. The workers were extremely resentful of the gangsters' frantic destruction and determined to strive for an early restoration of production under the existing conditions. The General Factory of the China Agricultural Machinery Manufacturing Company under the National Resources Commission was occupied by bandit troops before liberation. To prevent bandits from looting and destroying, the workers buried valuable machinery underground and welded all the iron bars and other materials placed in the open, making it impossible for the bandits to move them. Some workers guarded the machinery and warehouses, not sleeping for two days and nights. Now the factory is about to resume work, and the workers are preparing to hold a parade to celebrate. Before liberation, employees of the Universal Machinery Factory, formerly under the Kuomintang Resources Commission, fired shots and repelled bandits attempting to rob them. After liberation, they actively cleaned and repaired car engines to transport the PLA across the Huangpu River for combat. Most of the Huangpu River dockworkers hid when retreating bandit troops tried to seize ships. Some workers sank coal to the bottom of the river to prevent the bandits from sailing. A crew member of a Minsheng Shipping vessel was hung from the mast and severely beaten by bandit troops, forced to sail, but the ship workers never yielded. As soon as the PLA arrived, large numbers of crew members returned one after another. They stated that as long as the PLA needed it, their ships could be put into operation within a day or two. Workers at the British-owned Electric Tram Company organized a People's Security Team before liberation. Forty-nine workers in the Ninth Squad, after the PLA arrived, bravely crossed the PLA's cordon and attacked the enemy at the tram factory. They captured 396 enemies in the factory, including 19 enemy officers, and seized a batch of weapons and ammunition. Later, they sent three workers as guides for the PLA to search for remnants of the enemy at Yangshupu and Huangpu docks.

    反对匪帮迁移破坏　保全大部企业机器
    【新华社上海三十一日电】上海解放前，许多企业的职工们对国民党匪帮进行了反迁移反破坏的英勇斗争，有的工人并武装起来，在解放军到达时配合解放军作战，许多机器资财和建筑因而得保存。国民党匪帮曾企图将全国规模最大的江南造船所搬到台湾去。桂匪永清特限令在五月十五日前搬迁完毕，并派了海军陆战队第二师及军统特务储文思带领警卫营驻厂强迫工人拆卸装运。但是该所的工人与工程师职员们团结一致，拒绝搬运新造和修复的船舰。匪徒们无奈，只好派警卫营去搬运。匪徒们要拆卸机器零件，工人们将好的重要的设法留下来，专找旧的坏的给他们。装船时工人们故意不规则地乱装，使载三千吨的船只装了一千吨便无法再装。工程师把重要的技术图表都保藏起来，将一些无用或次要的交匪徒们带去。匪徒们也曾以威胁和利诱的办法强迫工程师和职工们到台湾去，但是全所近四千职工中，去台的不过二百人。许多工程师在工人的帮助下躲藏起来，得免劫持。职工们对匪徒们的疯狂破坏，极度愤恨，决心在现有条件下，争取早日恢复生产。国民党资源委员会中国农业机械制造公司总厂在解放前曾为匪军盘踞，工人们防匪抢劫破坏，便把贵重机器埋在地下，又把放在露天的铁条等全部焊接起来，使匪无法搬动。有的工人看守机器和仓库，两昼夜不曾睡觉。现该厂即将复工，工人们准备在复工时举行游行表示庆祝。原属国民党资源委员会的通用机器厂职工，解放前曾鸣枪击退企图抢劫的匪军，解放后又积极擦修汽车引擎，运输解放军渡过黄浦江作战。黄浦江的海员工人在溃退匪军抢抓船只时，大部都躲藏起来，有的工人则将煤炭沉入江底，使匪无法开船。民生轮一个船员曾被匪军吊在桅杆上痛打，迫令开船，但船工们始终没有屈服。解放军一到，大批船员们便陆续返回。他们表示，只要解放军需要，我们的船一两天内即可开动。英商电车公司的工人在解放前即组织了人民保安队。九中队的四十九个工人，在解放军到达后，就英勇地越过解放军的警戒线，进击在电车厂的敌人，他们在厂内俘虏了三百九十六名敌人，其中有敌尉官十九名，并缴获了一部武器弹药。以后他们又派了三个工人为解放军作向导，到杨树浦、黄浦码头搜索残敌。
