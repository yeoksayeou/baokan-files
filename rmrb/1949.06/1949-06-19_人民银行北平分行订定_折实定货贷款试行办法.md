　　People's Bank of Beiping Branch Formulates
  　Trial Measures for Inflation-Adjusted Order Loans
    [Our Newspaper's Report] The People's Bank of Beiping Branch has formulated and implemented trial measures for inflation-adjusted and order-based loans. The bank's branches (Jiaotong Bank, Bank of China), departments (branch business department), and offices (East, West, and South City offices) have successively undertaken loans in accordance with these measures. The measures first state that the purpose of piloting inflation-adjusted and order-based loans is to support production in order to stabilize prices. Secondly, it stipulates the loan targets, types, etc. The loan targets are public and private industrial and mining enterprises such as: machinery and production tool manufacturing plants, dyeing and weaving factories, chemical raw material plants, major mineral products, and special handicrafts that can exchange for foreign exchange by manufacturing export goods. All of the above-mentioned public and private industrial and mining enterprises and special handicrafts, due to expansion of business, addition of equipment, strengthening of output, purchase of raw materials, or due to seasonal slack months, the backlog of costs affecting production and all activities requiring working capital, can fill out an application form, attach a proposed plan, samples, and budget the amount of funds required, purpose, repayment method, loan period, and possible interest rates to contact the bank's handling departments. There are three types of loans: (1) Ordinary inflation-adjusted loans: The standard physical unit price of inflation-adjusted savings published by the bank's savings department every day is used as the unit standard for calculation and conversion at the time of lending and repayment. (2) Order-based in-kind loan: The condition for repaying the loan is the finished product produced. At the time of lending, the principal of the loan plus the interest due is converted into goods at the publicly wholesale price of the agreed repayment goods. Regardless of the price increase or decrease of the goods at maturity, the goods are repaid according to the agreed quality of the goods. (3) Order-based discount loan: The condition for repaying the loan is the finished product produced, but no physical object is repaid at maturity, and the cash is repaid at the publicly wholesale price of the item at the time of repayment. The calculation method is the same as the second type. As for the loan term, the trial measures stipulate that: depending on the purpose of the loan, the maximum term is from one month to six months, and those with a fixed term of six months shall be repaid in monthly installments in principle.
