[Ping Shi News] The North China Electric Power Beiping Branch, in order to avoid zonal power outages during the maintenance of Boiler No. 16, has again issued a call for electricity conservation to all government organs, schools, factories, and users. During the previous maintenance of Boiler No. 17 at the Shijingshan Power Plant, the company, as well as various government organs, schools, and users, were largely able to conserve electricity through various methods, ensuring the smooth completion of the task. However, some individual users still did not pay attention to electricity conservation: for example, Wen Faxiang at No. 172 Jinshi Fang Street, and Fuxing Trading Company at No. 195 Fu Nei Street, used electricity during lighting hours; and the Chang'an Restaurant at No. 11 Jiu Xingbu Street used neon lights (after explanation and persuasion, they all indicated that they would definitely correct this in the future). In order to consolidate our power generation equipment and avoid malfunctions, we have decided to carry out maintenance on Boiler No. 16 recently. We hope that all government organs, schools, factories, and all users will continue to conserve electricity, respond to the government's conservation movement, and avoid zonal power outages.

  　再次号召节电
  　检修锅炉期间避免分区停电
    【平市讯】华北电业北平分公司因检修十六号锅炉，避免分区停电，再次向各机关、学校、工厂及各用户发出节约用电号召。前次检修石景山发电所十七号锅炉时，该公司及各机关、学校与用户多能尽量用各种方法节电，使任务顺利完成；但也有个别用户对节约用电仍未注意：如锦什坊街一七二号文发祥、阜内大街一九五号阜兴商行在照明时间用电力；旧刑部街十一号长安饭店使用霓虹灯等（经解释劝告后，均表示今后定能改正）。我们为了巩固发电设备，避免发生故障，决定最近检修十六号锅炉，希望各机关、学校、工厂及所有用户继续节用电流，响应政府的节约运动，避免分区停电。
