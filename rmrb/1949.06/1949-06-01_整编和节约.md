　　Streamlining and Thrift
    The joint conference of departments of the North China People's Government, centered on discussions of streamlining and thrift, will play an important role in promoting the thrift movement in all North China regional government departments. Regarding the issue of thrift, this newspaper has repeatedly discussed it based on the calls of the North China Party and government organs. Recently, some organs have begun to study thrift plans and inspect waste, and students in Ping City's universities and middle schools have voluntarily returned their people's stipends. Workers have voluntarily adjusted their wages, and enterprise departments are also studying production and thrift plans. These are all excellent phenomena. The conference held by the North China People's Government can serve as a good example of institutional streamlining and thrift.
    This conference provided many important steps that can be used as a reference for various places to carry out thrift: First, there must be full preparation, investigation and research on relevant staffing, systems, waste phenomena, etc., as the basis for discussion. Second, carry forward the traditional spirit of hard struggle, oppose waste and extravagance, and do everything to support the front. Third, implement precise calculations in various enterprise departments to save manpower and materials and reduce costs, all for the purpose of restoring and developing production. Fourth, starting from the needs of work and the possible conditions of finance, start to study a set of streamlined and economical systems and methods that adapt to the new conditions, and then uniformly and centrally implement them. Of course, the main thing is to carefully consider the focus of each agency based on different conditions, and never generalize. For example, some places need to adjust their institutions, but some also need to add certain necessary institutions. In short, the goal is to do the work better, improve efficiency, and make the institutions more flexible. Fifth, appropriate arrangements have also been determined for surplus personnel, giving them appropriate opportunities for work, production, or study, rather than simply laying them off. This approach is entirely correct.
    The North China People's Government's conference was very successful. As long as we earnestly implement these good contents, we will surely achieve great success.

　　整编和节约
    以讨论整编和节约为中心的华北人民政府各部门联席会议，将对全华北区政府机关部门的节约运动起着重要的推动作用。关于节约问题，本报曾依据华北党政机关的号召一再有所论述，近来有的机关已在着手研究节约计划检查浪费，平市大中学生纷纷自动退领人民助学金，工人自动调整工资，企业部门也在研究生产节约计划，这是极好的现象，华北人民政府召开的这次会议，可以作为一个机关整编节约的很好榜样。
    这次会议提供了许多重要的步骤可以作为各地开展节约的参考：第一要有充分的准备，调查研究有关编制、制度、浪费现象等等情况作为讨论的依据。第二是发扬传统的艰苦奋斗的作风，反对浪费和铺张，一切为了支援前线。第三是在各个企业部门实行精密计算节省人力物力减低成本，一切为了恢复与发展生产。第四是从工作需要及财政的可能条件出发，着手研究一套适应新条件的精简节约制度和办法，然后统一集中地加以贯彻。当然，主要是依据不同条件慎重考虑各机关的重点，千万不可一般化。譬如有些地方要调整机构，可是也有的还要增加某些必要的机构，总之，目的是要把工作作得更好，效率更提高，机构更灵活。第五对于编余人员也确定了妥善的处理办法，给他们以适当的工作、生产或学习的机会，而不是简单地裁掉。这样的做法是完全正确的。
    华北人民政府这次的会开得很好，只要我们把这些好的内容认真加以贯彻，必然会收到很大的成功。
