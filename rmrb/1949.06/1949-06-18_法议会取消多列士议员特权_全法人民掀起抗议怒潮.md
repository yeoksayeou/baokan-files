　　French Parliament Revokes Thorez's Parliamentary Immunity
  　A Tide of Protest Sweeps France
    [Xinhua News Agency, Peiping, 16th] A tide of protest has swept across France against the illegal actions of the Parliamentary Committee on Privileges' revocation of the parliamentary immunity of French Communist Party General Secretary Thorez on the 9th, and the National Assembly's revocation of the parliamentary immunity of French Communist Party Propaganda Minister Bonté on the 7th.

    According to a report by a L'Humanité reporter: 100,000 people in the department of Loire held a mass protest rally in Saint-Étienne. The rally unanimously passed a resolution stating: "100,000 men and women of the Loire department, representing all strata of the people of the province, strongly protest the persecution of Duclos, Bonté, and especially French Communist Party General Secretary Thorez." The resolution emphasized: These persecutions confirm the government's intention to use the methods used by the Hitler government to eliminate the opposition. According to TASS, people in Villejuif, Seine, held a meeting and passed a resolution saying: "The people of Villejuif firmly protest the government's violation of freedom. The government seizes on the smallest pretext to persecute democrats, while traitors are released. We guarantee our full support for Thorez and our trust in Thorez." Railway workers on the Paris-Aubry line and at the Austerlitz station issued resolutions expressing their indignation at the deprivation of Thorez's parliamentary immunity and expressing their loyalty and love for "their great and dear Comrade Thorez." Similar mass protest rallies have also been held in many other parts of France.

　　法议会取消多列士议员特权
  　全法人民掀起抗议怒潮
    【新华社北平十六日电】全法国人民掀起了抗议的怒潮，反对国民议会议员特权委员会九日取消法共总书记多列士议员特权与国民议会七日取消法共宣传部长邦特议员特权的非法行为。
    据人道报记者报道：罗亚尔省十万人民在圣德田举行群众抗议大会，大会一致通过决议称：“罗亚尔省十万男女，代表该省一切人民阶层，强烈抗议对杜克洛、邦特，特别是法国共产党总书记多列士的迫害”。决议强调：这些迫害证实了政府打算用希特勒政府所使用的方法来消灭反对派。据塔斯社报道，赛纳省维利约夫人民集会通过决议说：“维利约夫的人民坚决抗议政府对自由的侵犯。政府抓住最小的借口迫害民主分子，而卖国贼却被释放。我们保证完全支持多列士、信任多列士。”巴黎——多布利克铁路线和奥斯特利茨车站的铁路工人，发表决议对剥夺多列士议员特权，表示愤慨，并表示效忠和热爱“他们伟大亲爱的多列士同志”。铁路工人自动保证广泛流传多列士的小册子“和平的战士们，团结起来！”法国其他许多地方，也召开了相同的群众抗议大会。
