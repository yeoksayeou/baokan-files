    [Broadcast by Beiping Xinhua Broadcasting Station] Nanjing, 5th—Nanjing's water and land transportation is gradually recovering. The Navigation Department of the Transportation Takeover Committee of the Nanjing Military Control Commission has completed the takeover of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Nanjing branch. A resumption ceremony was held on the afternoon of the 4th. The Military Control Commission took over the First Transportation Office and decided to resume long-distance bus service from Nanjing to Yixing starting on the 6th, and began selling tickets for intermediate stops such as Tangshan, Jurong, Laohekou, and Liyang. The Shaheji Bridge on the Pukou-Bengbu section of the Jinpu Railway, which was washed away by floods on the 28th of last month, was repaired and reopened to traffic on the 2nd of this month.
