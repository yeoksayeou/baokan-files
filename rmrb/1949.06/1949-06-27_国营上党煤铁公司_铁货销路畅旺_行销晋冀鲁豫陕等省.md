　　Taiyue Telegram: Since April, the sales of iron products from the state-run Shangdang Coal and Iron Company have shifted from sluggish to brisk. According to statistics from various branch companies (excluding Yuci), actual sales of various raw and wrought iron products in April exceeded 520,000 jin, accounting for 78.3% of the iron product absorption in April. Compared with the total sales in March, this represents an increase of approximately 85%, totaling over 11.78 million yuan in Renminbi. The breakthrough in the stagnant sales situation mainly began in late April, starting from Qinghua, Handan, Luoyang, Yincheng, and Zhengzhou. The Qinghua Iron Industry Company sold over 1,600 six- and eight-yin pots, weighing 250,000 jin, in just two days, April 22nd and 23rd. The Zhengzhou Iron Products Sales Office sold 700 to 800 six- and eight-yin pots daily. Iron products were sold in over 20 counties, including Linqing, Xingtai, Daming, Nanle, Guanxian, and Puyang in the eastern region, where wrought iron products and plowshares were mainly sold. In the southern region, sales occurred in Caoxian, Qixian, Wushe, Linying, Luohe, Kaifeng, Xuchang, Lingbao, Shanzhou, Dengfeng, and Gongxian, as well as Weishi, Yanling, Fugou, Taikang, and Peichuan in the Yellow River flooded area, where Jincheng pots and raw iron products were sold. In the western region, sales occurred in Hongdong, Linfen, Jiangzhou, and Hancheng, where Yangcheng raw iron products and some raw and wrought iron products from Jincheng were sold. Types of goods sold: Raw iron products such as cage-shaped plows, six- and eight-yin pots, plowshares, seven- and eight-fen stewpots, and ear pots sold the fastest, while wrought iron products such as fish-eye nails and iron shovels sold the fastest. The reasons for the shift from stagnant to brisk sales of iron products are mainly that the expanding liberated areas have greatly facilitated trade between various regions. The Henan Yellow River flooded area's democratic government provided loans to support mass production, and the masses actively purchased production tools and daily necessities. Furthermore, the branch companies of the Shangdang Coal and Iron Company correctly implemented the policy of "small profits and quick sales." In the context of brisk sales, they maintained a steady increase in iron product prices, proactively organized sales work, and took care of the profits of transporters, which stimulated merchants in various regions.

　　国营上党煤铁公司
  　铁货销路畅旺
  　行销晋冀鲁豫陕等省
    【太岳电】国营上党煤铁公司铁货销路，四月以来，已由滞转畅。据各分支公司（缺榆次）的统计，四月份实销各种生熟铁货五十二万余斤，占四月份铁货吸收量的百分之七十八点三，与三月份总销量比较，约超过百分之八十五，共计总值人民币一千一百七十八万余元。销路停滞局面的打开，主要是从四月下旬，首先由清化、邯郸、洛阳、荫城、郑州等地开始的，清化铁业公司，仅在四月二十二、二十三两日，即销售出六、八印锅一千六百余口，计重量达二十五万斤；郑州铁货推销处，每日销售铁物六、八印锅达七、八百口。铁货销行地方共有二十多县，东路计有：临清、邢台、大名、南乐、冠县、濮阳等地，销出多为熟铁货及犁面；南路计有：曹县、淇县、武涉、临颖、漯河、开封、许昌、灵宝、陕州、登封、巩县等地，黄泛区尉氏、鄢陵、扶沟、太康、沛川等地，销出晋城锅生铁货；西路计有：洪洞、临汾、绛州、韩城等地，销出阳城生铁货，及部分晋城的生、熟铁货。销货种类：生铁货以笼鈚、六、八印锅、犁面、七、八分熬、耳锅较快，熟铁货以鱼眼钉类及铁锹较快。铁货销路由停滞转到畅旺的原因，主要是解放区日益扩大，大大便利了各地区之间的贸易，河南黄泛区民主政府贷款扶植群众生产，群众积极购置生产工具及日用必需品。再就是上党煤铁公司所属各分支公司，正确执行了“薄利推销”的方针。在畅销的情况下，仍保持着铁货价格的平稳上升状态，并主动积极地组织推销工作，照顾了运输者的利润，使各地商贩活跃起来。
