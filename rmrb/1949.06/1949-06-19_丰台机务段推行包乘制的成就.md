The Achievements of the Fengtai Locomotive Depot in Implementing the Contract Responsibility System

　　By our reporter Xing Jun

　　In the past, as the train crews said, "We can't do the big jobs, we just muddle through the small ones. We have limited fuel, so we shut it down two stops early! We only want the locomotive to make a round trip, and we don't care if it's damaged or not." Since liberation, especially after the implementation of the contract responsibility system, the above situation and all kinds of other problems have undergone fundamental changes.

　　In March, with the improvement of the workers' political awareness, the Fengtai Locomotive Depot changed the past large-scale shift system, and implemented a crew responsibility system for thirty locomotives. The train crews freely formed groups, and the work of adding coal, watching the fire, lighting the fire, removing the fire, adding oil, and cleaning the locomotive, which was previously done by many people, was fixed to three people per shift, rotating nine people in three shifts. At the beginning, although the interest was strong, the specific methods were not yet familiar. Soon, the "Mao Zedong" locomotive came from the Northeast. This locomotive, which had been implementing the contract responsibility system for a long time, brought new systems and experience, which inspired everyone's emotions. The first step was mainly to clean the locomotives, because the workers understood that the locomotives were in their own hands, and that it was honorable to do a good job and shameful to do a bad job, so they worked very actively. Whether it was day or night, as long as there was a small space, even a few minutes of parking at the platform, they were busy scraping off the rust and grease that had accumulated on the locomotive for many years. When materials were lacking, and there was no cotton thread, they bought linen with their own money; when there was no sandpaper, they used red bricks; some locomotives had damaged motors, so they offered the electric wires they had hidden during the puppet regime to install electric lights, which made the locomotives increasingly in good condition. The train crews' love for the locomotives was even more meticulous, often insisting on detailed inspections after returning from running a train in the middle of the night before they were willing to sleep.

　　After completing the locomotive cleaning task, in order to achieve the requirement that the train crews learn "Level B and C inspections" in at most one and a half years, so as to gradually move from responsible for safekeeping and driving to simple repairs, the focus of work shifted to learning maintenance. All 400 or so train crew members in the entire depot, all those who did not have a fired-up locomotive to run, participated in the factory's maintenance operations. The craftsmen adopted the method of taking apprentices, placing the drivers and stokers in various parts, working and learning at the same time, and keeping records for performance evaluation. The train crews responsible for running the trains could only participate collectively when there were "Level B and C inspections" due to time constraints. At the same time, the two groups alternated in a planned manner, so that they all had the opportunity to learn on-site. Because the factory also implemented piece-rate repair contracts, the craftsmen and train crews were of one mind. Whenever a locomotive entered the factory, it was carefully inspected and thoroughly repaired. The craftsmen taught earnestly, and the train crews learned humbly, and the old conservative ideas and the phenomenon of mutual incompatibility were quickly overcome. This organized and planned promotion laid the foundation for the train crews to learn maintenance ahead of schedule. Not long ago, driver Yang Jingqiang told reporters: "In the past, I only knew to open the steam valve and go, and close the brake and stop. I didn't know the mystery of it. After half a month of detailed study in the factory, I now know about the phenomenon of air leakage from the air pump, how much it is worn, the installation and removal procedures, the cause of the failure, and how to deal with it." Recently, the train crews of locomotives No. 1939, 1925, 1829, and 1600 have successively proposed to start doing their own "Level C inspections" from June, which is a good illustration.

　　Due to the good maintenance of the locomotives, safe running, improved work efficiency, and saved a large amount of manpower and material resources. Before the contract responsibility system, the condition of the locomotives was poor, coupled with disrepair of the tracks and poor dispatching, the efficiency was very low, and the waste was large. In March, 40 locomotives were used, with an average daily mileage of 84 kilometers per locomotive, of which the time spent banked and on standby accounted for 9,787 hours. If calculated at 100 kilograms of coal burned per hour, that is a waste of 978,700 kilograms; at a flat price of 5.2 yuan per kilogram, the total is equivalent to 5,089,240 yuan in People's Currency. April was better than the previous month, the locomotive utilization rate gradually increased, 28 locomotives were used, the average daily mileage per locomotive increased to 154 kilometers, and the time spent banked and on standby decreased to 4,386 hours, reducing unnecessary consumption by more than half. Starting in May, the number of trains and the turnaround routes were improved. Five locomotives originally assigned to shunting and switching tasks in this depot were reassigned, with one locomotive responsible for the small runs on the Pingdong and Dongjiao lines, saving the consumption of two to three temporary locomotives previously used there. In particular, after the influence of the May 1st holiday, the train crews formulated competition plans one after another, and insisted on holding a small group meeting every week to summarize experience and improve shortcomings. As a result, work efficiency was unprecedentedly improved: with the same task, the number of locomotives used was reduced to 24, and the average daily mileage per locomotive reached 231.3 kilometers, exceeding the bureau's quota of 200 kilometers by 15 percent. The young May 1st Labor Day locomotive safely traveled 7,323.1 kilometers in 26 days, and reached 481 kilometers in one day on the 27th, setting a new record for the entire depot. In terms of safety, 13 liability accidents occurred in March, which decreased to two in April, and were almost eliminated in May. Regarding the preparation time for entering the roundhouse, loading coal, and adding water, with the close cooperation of the coal platform workers, it was also shortened from one hour to one hour and 30 minutes before April to 20 to 40 minutes. Fired repairs and unnecessary banking have been basically overcome. In addition, the train crews automatically paid attention to conservation, such as the crew of locomotive No. 1939, who turned off the oil check valve whenever they stopped, and took out the remaining oil with an oil pot when handing over the shift, saving more than 10 kilograms of cylinder oil in one month, and returning it to the material warehouse, earning a glorious commendation.

　　In order to obtain better results and strive to reach the requirement of an average daily mileage of 250 kilometers after the implementation of the new operation system in June, the depot affairs meeting decided to work hard in two aspects. One is to implement the responsibility system, continue to strengthen the leadership of the train crews' political and business learning, improve the small group meetings, give full play to the collective wisdom of the worker masses, and improve further, and take care of the health of the workers in the competition; the other is to further strengthen the cooperation of the relevant departments. Regarding the phenomenon of delays caused by the irresponsibility of some station masters (such as Xizhimen and Anding) towards their work, it is suggested that the relevant leaders pay attention.

　　丰台机务段推行包乘制的成就
    本报记者  邢军
    往日，如乘务员所说：“大活干不了，小活凑合跑，给油有限，就关上两站！只求机车往返一遭，再也不管它有无伤损。”解放以来，特别是推行包乘制之后，上述情形和其他种种，都起了根本变化。
    三月间，丰台机务段，随着工人政治觉悟的提高，改变过去的大轮班，三十台机车实行乘务负责制。乘务员自由结组，将过去揸火、看火、点火、落火、给油、擦车等由许多人分做的一套工作，固定三人一班，九人三班轮流担负。开始，虽兴趣很浓，但具体作法尚不熟悉。不久，东北开来了“毛泽东号”，这个实行包乘制很久的机车，带来了新的制度和经验，鼓舞了大家的情绪。第一步主要进行机车清扫工作，因为工人懂得机车掌握在自己手里，弄得好，很光荣，弄不好，自己丑的道理，工作非常积极。无论白天夜里，只要有个小空，甚至在站台停车几分钟，都忙着刮机车上多年的锈和油垢。材料缺乏，没有绵丝，自己拿钱买线麻；没有砂布用红砖；有些机车电机破损了，便献出在敌伪时代隐蔽的电线装制电灯，这使机车状态日益良好。乘务员对机车的爱护，更是无微不至，时常半夜跑车回来，仍坚持细密检查，然后才肯睡觉。
    完成机车清扫任务之后，为实现乘务员最多一年半学会“乙、丙检”的要求，以逐渐从负责保管、驾驶进到简单修理，工作重点便转入学习检修。全段乘务员四百来人，凡无火预备的机车乘务员，全部参加工厂检修作业。工匠采用拉徒弟的办法，将司机司炉分别按置在各个部分，一面工作，一面学习，并作好记录，以便考核成绩。担负跑车的机班，因时间所限，只有“乙、丙检”的时候才能集体参加。同时两者有计划的交替，使其均有实地学习的机会。因为工厂也实行了包件包修，使工匠和乘务员拧成了一条心，每逢机车入厂，都是细密检查，彻底修理。工匠认真的教，乘务员虚心的学，旧有的保守观念和相互格格不入的现象，亦迅速克服。如此有组织有计划的推动，打下了乘务员提前学会检修的基础。不久以前，司机杨景强语记者：“过去只知道机车开汽门就走，关闸就停，其中的奥妙不清楚；经过在工厂细密部半月的学习，对风泵漏气现象，磨耗多少，装卸手续，故障的原因及处理，都已晓得。”最近，一九三九、一九二五、一八二九、一六○○号机车乘务员，先后提出从六月份开始自己作“丙检”，这便是很好的说明。
    由于机车保修良好，走行安全，提高了工作效率，节省了大批人力物力。包乘前机车状态恶劣，加之路线失修，调度不良，效率很低，浪费也大。三月份使用机车四十台，平均日车走行八十四公里，其中压火备用时间占九千七百八十七小时，如果以每小时烧煤一百公斤计算，即浪费九十七万八千七百公斤；按平价每公斤五元二角计，共折人民券五百零八万九千二百四十元。四月份较上月为好，机车运用率逐渐提高，使用机车二十八台，平均日车公里增至一百五十四公里，压火备用时间减至四千三百八十六小时，不必要的消耗减少一倍还多。五月开始，车次交路有所改进，将本段原来担负调车甩挂任务的五台机车，抽出一台负责平东、东郊等线的小运转，节省以往此处两台至三台临时机车的消耗。特别是经过五一节的影响，各乘务组纷纷制定竞赛计划，并坚持每周开一次小组会，总结经验，改进缺点，因此，工作效率空前提高：同等任务，使用机车减为二十四台，平均日车公里达二百三十一点三，超过局定二百公里的百分之十五。年青的五一劳动号，二十六天内安全走行七千三百二十三点一公里，二十七日一天达四百八十一公里，创全段最高纪录。在安全方面，三月份发生责任事故十三件，四月份减至两件，五月份即趋绝灭。关于入房上煤上水等整备时间，在煤台工人的密切配合下，亦由四月以前的一点钟至一点三十分，缩短为二十分至四十分。有火修和不必要的压火现象，基本上得以克服。除此，乘务员自动注意了节约，如一九三九号机车，每逢停车即把油止弁关好，接交班时将存油用油壶接出来，一个月省下汽缸油十多公斤，交回了材料库，获得了光荣的表扬。
    为了获得更好的成绩，争取六月份施行新运行制后，达到平均日车公里二百五十的要求，段务会议确定要从两方面努力。一是贯彻负责制，继续加强对乘务员的政治与业务学习的领导，健全小组会议，充分发挥工人群众的集体智慧，再提高一步，并照顾竞赛中工人身体的健康；一是进一步密切有关部门的配合。对目前某些车站站长（如西直门、安定）对工作不负责任而致发生晚点的现象，建议有关领导上提起注意。
