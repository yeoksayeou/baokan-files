    Disorderly Procedures and Lax System
    Linqing Huamao Warehouse Suffers Huge Losses
    Public Enterprises in Various Regions Should Pay Close Attention

    [Reported by this newspaper] The state-owned Huamao Warehouse in Linqing City, due to insufficient attention to the people's property, lack of work responsibility, disorderly procedures, and a lax system, used slips of paper as accounting books, commodity ledgers as commodity storage books, and deposit slips as individual storage accounts. Commodities were never thoroughly inventoried, only the slips were counted, and the physical items were not inspected. As a result, during last year's (1948) final accounting, the warehouse was short 14,213 jin of cotton wadding and 280,617 *shi chi* of native cloth. Knowing that the total number of deposit slips did not match the commodity ledger, they neither investigated nor reported it to the higher-level management authorities, but handled it themselves, profiting when there were gains and taking losses when there were shortages. Furthermore, managers did not hand over responsibilities when transferred, and there were no account books to check, resulting in unresolved cases, which is truly unacceptable. The disastrous consequences caused by such lax leadership, a loose system, and sloppy procedures should be taken seriously by state-owned and public factories and shops in various regions.

    手续紊乱制度不严
    临清华茂货栈亏损巨大
    各地公营企业应严加注意
    【本报讯】临清市国营华茂货栈，因平时对人民财产重视不够，缺乏工作责任心，手续紊乱，制度不严，以条子代帐簿，以商品帐代商品保管簿，以存户存条代保管分户帐，商品从未彻底盘存，只盘存条子，不检查实物，致于去年（一九四八年度）决算时，库内短少棉绒一万四千二百一十三斤，土布二十八万零六百一十七双市尺。明知存条总数与商品帐不符，既不检查追究，对上级管理机关亦不报告，即自行处理，多则收益，少则出损。平时经理调动工作不交代，又无帐簿可查，致成悬案，实不应该。此种领导上松懈，制度不严，手续马虎所造成的恶果，应引起各地国营、公营工厂、商店的严加注意。
