Xinhua News Agency, Qingdao, 11th—The People's Liberation Army stationed in Qingdao has demonstrated the true qualities of a people's army with its strict discipline. One company, despite having engaged in a continuous three-day pursuit battle, still maintained high spirits and conscientiously guarded warehouses. When one unit first entered the city, their billets had not been determined, and the soldiers camped on the streets. A certain unit of the People's Liberation Army, responsible for protecting the affiliated hospital of Shandong University, declined the hospital's offer of housing and assistance with boiling water for cooking, despite being weary from pursuing the enemy for two days and nights. They all camped under the trees in the hospital grounds. When the hospital staff requested the troops to temporarily rest in the nurses' duty room, the soldiers declined. Lightly wounded soldiers Wang Y茂 and Song Wanfu said, "As long as we protect the hospital, suffering a little is nothing." In the old site of a puppet police station where a certain company was stationed, there were many "tatami" (Japanese straw mats), but none of the soldiers touched them. They all slept on the ground and encouraged each other, saying, "After winning the battle, we must strive to be models of discipline." Because the Liberation Army did not commit the slightest offense and wholeheartedly protected the city, many citizens praised them, saying, "I have never seen such a good army in my life. This is truly a people's army!"

Xinhua News Agency, Qingdao, 11th—One hundred and forty-nine primary and secondary schools in Qingdao have largely reopened. According to statistics up to the 6th, all twenty-nine middle schools and above have reopened, with attendance rates exceeding 80%. All sixteen public primary schools in the city, with more than 18,600 students, have reopened. Of the forty public primary schools in the suburbs, eleven have reopened. Sixty-four other primary schools belonging to organizations and groups have also partially reopened. The remaining schools are also actively resuming operations. After the liberation of Qingdao, the Military Control Commission first sent personnel to each school to announce the cultural and educational policies of the People's Government and called on all staff and students to protect school buildings and all equipment and to resume classes quickly. As a result, most schools only closed for two or three days before reopening. During the reopening process, the students actively repaired school buildings and playgrounds, and arranged books and instruments. Many teachers and staff personally sorted out equipment and tidied up dormitories. The students enthusiastically requested to learn more revolutionary knowledge, current affairs, and the various policies of the Communist Party.

　　青岛解放军全心保护城市
  　市民同声赞誉
  　全市学校迅速复课
    【新华社青岛十一日电】进驻青岛的人民解放军纪律严明，表现了人民军队的本色。某连虽然经过了连续三天的追击战，仍能以饱满的精神认真看管仓库。某部初入市内时，驻址未经确定，战士们便在街上露营。负责保护山东大学附属医院的解放军某部，不顾两昼夜追击敌人的疲倦，婉言谢绝了该院让住房屋和烧水作饭的招待，全体在院里的树下露营。院方请部队暂到护士值班室休息，也为战士们谢绝。身负轻伤的战士王玉茂、宋万福说：“只要保护好医院，吃点苦算不了什么。”某连驻地伪警察所旧址，屋里存有很多“塔塔密”（日本草垫子），但战士们谁也不去动用，都是就地伙铺睡觉，并且互相勉励说：“仗打胜了，还要争取遵守纪律的模范。”由于解放军秋毫无犯，全心保护城市，许多市民都这样赞誉说：“我有生以来从未看到过这样好的军队。这才真是人民的军队啊。”
    【新华社青岛十一日电】青岛大、中、小学一百四十九所已经大部复课。据到六日为止的统计，中学及中学以上学校二十九所已全部复课，到校学生达百分之八十以上。市内公立小学十六所，学生一万八千六百多人，已经全部复课。市郊公立小学四十所中，有十一所已经复课。其他属于机关团体的小学六十四处，也部分复课。其余各校，也在积极恢复中。青岛解放后，军管会首先派员到各校宣布人民政府的文化教育政策，并号召各校员生保护校舍和一切用具，迅速复课。因此大部学校只停课二、三天，即复课。在复课过程中，各校学生积极修理校舍、操场，安置图书仪器，很多教职员都亲自整理用具，收拾宿舍。学生们都热情的要求多学习革命知识、时局和共产党的各种政策。
