	Reading "Backward Brains"
	Zhao Zhongyi
	From the People's Daily supplement of June 12th to 15th, I read Mr. Li Erzhong's short story depicting how an interesting old soldier from a poor peasant background transformed from having a "backward brain" to a progressive mind. I seemed to hear the voice of the old soldier Han Junting, and I seemed to see his expressionless face, his slightly contemptuous gaze, and the way he puffed on his yellow cigarette. I was even more astonished by the author's deep understanding of the soldier's psychological experience during this transformation process.
	For peasants who had long been shackled by barbaric politics and a natural economy, it was only natural to face this new era and new society with a "backward brain." The question is how to educate them to move this "backward brain" toward progress. The author is quite careful in dealing with this theme. The transformation of thought is not something that can be achieved overnight. Han Junting joined the Eighth Route Army in 1940, had already served for five years, barely risen to the rank of squad leader, and also knew that joining the Eighth Route Army was not for promotion and wealth, but to serve the people through revolution. He would also say at criticism meetings: "Criticism is for seeking progress and experience. Chairman Mao has long told us to criticize, wash our faces, look in the mirror, and oppose arrogance, subjectivism, disobedience to the organization, and individualism!" But he only knew how to criticize others and didn't know how to criticize himself. Relying on his seniority, he always acted superior to others.
	The superiors were anxious about Han Junting's lack of progress. The political instructor or guidance officer repeatedly talked to him, urging him to study hard and improve his thinking, but with little effect.
	In order to protect the emergency repair of Zhangwu Bridge, the team held several meetings. Before the soldiers' meeting, a meeting of cadres above the squad leader level was convened. Han Junting, as usual, squatted in the back smoking, saying nothing. Only after the company commander sincerely asked for his advice did he, based on his rich combat experience, offer specific suggestions. After the meeting, the guidance officer said to the company commander, "Old Han still has some sense!" The company commander said, "He has some experience after all these years. If his thinking is straightened out, he would have just made a few sarcastic remarks if we hadn't persuaded him!" The guidance officer said, "In the future, respect him more than criticize him, and he may make faster progress!" The guidance officer already understood the art of political guidance. "When calling the roll and giving a speech in the evening, the guidance officer especially called on the veteran comrades to play a backbone role, and the new comrades to learn from the veteran comrades in tense and dangerous situations. He emphasized that the veteran comrades had experience and methods. Not only Han Junting, but all the veteran comrades felt that their responsibilities were greater." Here, the application and effect of the art of work is naturally expressed.
	After that, although Han Junting was still the same as before, always trying to take petty advantages, the whole squad felt that this annoying squad leader had become lovable. He worked much harder than before and really cared about everyone.
	Finally, due to Han Junting's resourcefulness and bravery, an enemy plane was shot down, and he himself was injured and lost too much blood. Everyone in his squad gave him blood transfusions. After spending that period of unconsciousness in the sanatorium, he experienced the comrades' love for him, and he finally reflected on himself. He understood that "in daily life, many of his words and actions were unreasonable and unfair to his comrades. Whenever he got angry, he didn't care about anything, just wanting to be happy for a moment,...scolding them, putting them down with big words,...but now, when he was in trouble, in a life-or-death situation, everyone gave their own blood!" Therefore, he thought that after he recovered, he "couldn't be like the past" anymore.
	Originally, he shot down the plane and received a commendation from his superiors, which was published in the newspaper. The newspaper was sent to him by the guidance officer and Ma Ziliang, who happily read it to him. Anyone else would have been extremely proud and elated, but Han Junting's face was still like an iron plate. He was not complacent because of this achievement, but only wanted his wound to heal quickly so he could go out and do something useful! From such a profound description, the author's so-called rebirth has given us positive inspiration.
	Although this story focuses on soldiers as the object of description and the target audience, Han Junting's "backward brain" has universality. We intellectuals inevitably have such brains, or even more backward ones. Han Junting's words about arrogance, subjectivism, and individualism inadvertently described himself, and inadvertently described us as well. This is worthy of our deep reflection!

    读“落后的脑袋”
    赵仲邑
    从六月十二日至十五日的人民日报副刊上，读到了李尔重先生这篇描写一个贫农出身的有趣的老战士怎样由“落后的脑袋”而锻炼为进步的思想的小说，我仿佛听见了老战士韩俊庭说话的声音，仿佛看见了他那没有表情的脸孔，轻藐地一楞的眼睛，巴答巴答地抽着黄烟时的样子。我更惊愕于作者描写这老战士转变过程对士兵心理体验的深入。
    长久束缚在野蛮政治和自然经济底下的农民，一下暴露在这新时代新社会的面前，带着一个“落后的脑袋”是很自然的，问题就是怎样教育使这“落后的脑袋”走向进步。作者在处理这个主题时是够细心的。思想的转变并非一蹴即就的事。韩俊庭一九四○年当了八路，已经当了五年，勉强升了班长，也知道了当八路军不是为升官发财，知道了革命为人民服务，开检讨会时也会说：“检讨为了求进步，求经验。毛主席老早就告诉我们说，要检讨，要洗脸，照镜子，反对自高自大、主观主义、不服从组织、个人主义！”但他只知道检讨别人，而不知道检讨自己。凭着资格老，凡事都压人一等。
    上级为着韩俊庭的不进步着急。教导员或指导员屡次找他谈话，劝他努力学习，好好锻炼思想，但是效果很小。
    为着保卫彰武桥的抢修，队里开了好几次会。军人大会之前，又召集了班长以上干部开会，韩俊庭和往常一样，蹲在最后边抽烟，一言不发，经连长真心诚意的向他请教，好容易他才根据了他丰富的作战经验，提供了具体的意见。散会后指导员对连长说：“老韩这个人还是有点意思呢！”连长说：“他干了这些年，经验是有的，只要他思想顺过来，今天要不是左劝右劝，他还不是说两句风凉话算了！”指导员说：“以后，多尊重他点，比多批评，可能进步还快些！”指导员已经明白了政治指导工作的艺术了。“到了晚上点名讲话时，指导员特别号召老同志要起骨干作用，新同志要在紧张危难中向老同志学习。强调老同志有经验有办法。不单韩俊庭，连所有老同志听了都感到自己的责任重大些。”这里很自然的表现了工作艺术的运用和效果。
    之后，韩俊庭虽然还是一样的好占小便宜，但全班已经觉着这讨厌的班长变得可爱了。他比以前的工作紧张了许多，真也为大家上了心。
    终于因为韩俊庭的机智和英勇，敌人一架飞机被击落了，而他自己也受了伤，流血过多，他班里的人大家给他输血。他在休养所渡过了那段昏迷阶段之后，体味了同志们对他的爱，他终于反省了。他明白了他“在平日生活中，有许多言语举动，不近人情，对不住同志们，只要自己心里一上火，什么也不管，图过一时高兴，……熊过他们，拿大话压他们，……眼下，自己处在难中，性命交关，大家拿出自己的血来！”因此他想到复原以后，他“可不能再象过去”了。
    本来他打下了飞机，得到上级的传令嘉奖，登了报。报纸由指导员和马子亮送到他那里，欢天喜地的念给他听，在别人听了该是多么的得意忘形，然而韩俊庭听了，脸皮还是铁板一样。他并不以这次立了功劳而自骄自满，一心只想伤口快点封口，好出去，好好办点事！从这样深刻的描写里，作者所说的新生，已经给我们积极的启示了。
    这篇小说虽然以士兵为描写对象和接受对象，但韩俊庭“落后的脑袋”是有着普遍性的。我们知识分子免不了也是这样甚至还要落后。韩俊庭所说的自高自大、主观主义、个人主义、无形中说了他自己，无形中也说了我们。这值得我们深切的反省！
