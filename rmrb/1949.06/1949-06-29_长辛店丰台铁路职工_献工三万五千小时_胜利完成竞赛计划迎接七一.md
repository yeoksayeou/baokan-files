　　Changxindian Fengtai Railway Workers
  　Dedicate 35,000 Work Hours
  　Successfully Complete Competition Plan to Greet July 1st
    [Special Dispatch from this Newspaper] Railway workers in Changxindian and Fengtai, to welcome "July 1st," after the Red May production surge, universally launched a production increase competition in early June. According to statistics from seven units, including the Changxindian Railway Machinery Factory, South Factory, Electrical Machinery Repair Factory, Locomotive Depot, and Fengtai Engineering Section, Locomotive Depot, and Bridge Factory, 2,143 employees voluntarily worked overtime, dedicating 35,643 hours, repairing and manufacturing more than twenty types of locomotives, bridges, machinery, and tools, completing the plan ahead of schedule.
    Forty-Two Bridges Completed, Slow Traffic Eliminated on the Pingbao Line
    The production increase competition first started on the Pingbao Line. All employees of the Changxindian Engineering Section and the First Engineering Office of the Railway Corps first discussed the conditions for welcoming "July 1st." Everyone highly utilized the combination of labor and intelligence under the tasks of rushing to repair bridges, strengthening road maintenance, eliminating slow traffic, and ensuring safety during the rainy season, overcoming numerous difficulties. When repairing the Beihe Bridge project, in order to transport more than 300 tons of steel beams, they used two discarded locomotive wheels combined together, installed ball bearings, and made a turntable to replace the crane, greatly saving manpower. When repairing the Xiaojuma River Bridge, more than twenty workers braved the five-meter deep river water and fished out more than 150 cubic meters of flagstone in four days to build piers and abutments. Under the slogan of realizing "three thoroughs" (stones thoroughly wet, turning thoroughly on the plate, boxes thoroughly trampled), they created a new North China work rate of 0.78 work points per cubic meter of cement, ensuring the early repair of 38 bridges on the entire line in the first half of the year, and adding the repair of four bridges expected to be completed in the second half of the year. Since then, the entire Pingbao section has fully restored the main line, and the five-kilometer slow-speed signs installed at the bridgeheads for a long time have also been removed.
    Overtime Production, Manufacturing Gifts
    The Changxindian Railway Machinery Factory's boiler factory worked overtime to repair two boilers for a 45-ton crane. The repair and parts yard revived a 35-horsepower railcar and converted it to burn wood, saving gasoline. The forging workshop added 22,800 rail spikes. The passenger and freight car yard made 10,000 Class A inspection plates and 1,000 pieces of glass for electric welding. The machinery yard made 100 files and two rock drills. The recycled products yard used waste wall stones to burn 100 tons of white lime, demolished a bunker to repair a coke oven, made 150 kilograms of welding rods, burned 300 kilograms of charcoal from branches, made 300 cotton silk rolls, and used waste materials to make 60 insert locks. Engineer Wang personally guided the repair of a rail straightening machine that had been unusable for forty years but is now urgently needed. All employees of the South Factory rushed to repair one traction car, rail sawing machine, hand-cranked blower, AC booster, water pump, and oil pump each in their spare time. The Electrical Machinery Repair Factory specially repaired two brand-new complete track circuit machines, and learned from Harbin how to modify a rocking motor to replace the dry batteries of the track circuit machine. The locomotive depot repaired a damaged locomotive and named it "July 1st Birth Number." The Fengtai Locomotive Depot transported a damaged locomotive from Qinhuangdao and repaired it as "Fengtai July 1st." The engineering section's waterway workers dug out 300 meters of iron pipes and 300 sections of cylinder pipes buried during the Japanese occupation. The carpentry, ironwork, and painters jointly repaired two handcars and one hundred hammers. Young worker Song Chunlu and seventeen others from the Bridge Factory, under the desire to work hard in production and strive to join the League, worked nearly 1,000 overtime hours in a month, completing two spans of 6.55-meter steel beams.

　　长辛店丰台铁路职工
  　献工三万五千小时
  　胜利完成竞赛计划迎接七一
    【本报特讯】长辛店丰台铁路职工，为迎接“七一”，继红五月生产突击之后，于六月初又普遍展开增产竞赛。据长辛店铁路机厂、南厂、电机修造厂、机务段及丰台工务段、机务段、桥梁厂等七个单位的统计，员工自动义务加班者二千一百四十三人，献工三万五千六百四十三小时，修制机车、桥梁、机械、工具二十余种，提前完成计划。
    四十二座桥竣工　平保线消灭慢行
    增产竞赛首先从平保线发起。长辛店工务段及铁道兵团第一工程处全体员工，最先讨论了迎接“七一”的条件，大家在抢修桥梁、加强养路、消灭慢行、保证雨季安全的任务下，高度发挥了劳动与智慧相结合的作用，克服了重重困难；修理北河桥工程时，为运输三百多吨钢梁，利用两个废机车轮合在一起，装置滚珠，制为转盘，代替起重机，大大节省了人力；修小拒马河桥，二十多个工友，冒五公尺深的河水，四天捞出一百五十多方片石，砌成垛基，打墩台，在实现三透（石子湿透、盘上翻透、盒子踩透）的口号下，创造了每方洋灰点七八工的华北新工率，保证了全线上半年三十八座桥的提早修复，且增修预计下半年完成的桥梁四处；从此，平保段全部恢复正线，桥头装置已久的五公里徐行标帜，亦被拔除。
    加班生产　装制献礼
    长辛店铁路机厂制炉厂加班修好四十五吨起重机用的锅炉两台；修配场复活三十五马力轧道车一辆，并改烧木炭，节省汽油；锻工场增打道钉二万二千八百个；客货车场制甲检牌一万块，电焊烧用玻璃一千块；机械场制锉刀一百把，风钻两个；再制品场利用废墙石烧白灰一百吨，拆碉堡修焦炭窑一座，电焊条一百五十公斤，树枝烧炭三百公斤，卷绵丝卷三百个，废料制插锁六十把；王工程师亲手指导修好四十年不能用，目前又迫切需要的轨道调直机。南厂全体职工，在业余时间赶修牵引车、锯轨机、手摇吹风机、交流助力机、水泵、油泵各一台。电机修造厂特别修好两台崭新的全部路牌机，并从哈尔滨学来改装摇电机代替路牌机干电池。机务段修好一台破损机车，订名“七一诞生号”。丰台机务段从秦皇岛运来一台破损机车，修为“丰台七一号”。工务段水道工挖出日本统治时期埋下的铁管三百公尺，缸管三百节；木铁油漆匠合力修好两辆手摇车，一百个锤＠。桥梁厂青年工友宋淳禄等十七人在努力生产，争取入团的意愿下，一个月额外加班近一千工时，完成六点五五公尺的钢梁两孔。
