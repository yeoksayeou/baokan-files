    [This Newspaper's report] Following the placing of an order with loans for 8,000 tons of Mentougou lump coal from the Zhongxing Coal Mine, the Jiaotong Bank of Ping has now ordered a total of 7,000 tons of lump and pulverized coal from the Hongshun and Siwei coal mines. Hongshun and Siwei are both large private coal mines in Mentougou, and they experience sluggish sales every summer off-season. In order to solve their sales difficulties and maintain the continued production of the two mines, so they are not affected by sluggish sales, the Jiaotong Bank decided to provide assistance by placing orders with loans. The first batch of loans amounted to RMB 21,935,610, for the purchase of 7,000 tons of Mentougou coal (2,500 tons of lump coal and 4,500 tons of pulverized coal), of which RMB 12,145,140 was loaned to Hongshun Coal Mine, equivalent to 4,000 tons of lump and pulverized coal. RMB 9,790,470 was loaned to Siwei Coal Mine, equivalent to 3,000 tons of lump and pulverized coal. The contract was signed on the afternoon of the 22nd, stipulating a monthly interest rate of six percent and a term of one month, with delivery in Mentougou upon maturity (July 22nd). As for the use of the loans by the two mines, it is mainly for wage development and the purchase of kiln wood. (Yu)

    平交通银行贷款二千余万
    续订门煤七千吨
    解决私营矿淡月滞销困难
    【本报讯】平交通银行继以定货贷款方式定购中兴煤矿门煤块八千吨之后，现又定购宏顺、四维两煤矿块末煤共七千吨。宏顺和四维都是门头沟较大的私营煤矿，每逢夏季淡月即发生滞销现象。交通银行为解决他们的销路困难，保持两矿继续生产，不因滞销而受到影响，决定以定货贷款方式加以扶助。首批贷予人民币二千一百九十三万五千六百一十元，定购门煤七千吨（块煤二千五百吨、末煤四千五百吨），其中贷予宏顺煤矿一千二百一十四万五千一百四十元，折合块末煤四千吨。四维煤矿九百七十九万零四百七十元，折合块末煤三千吨。合同已于二十二日下午签订，规定月息六厘，期限一个月，到期（七月二十二日）在门头沟交货。至于两矿借款用途，主要是开发工薪和购买窑木。      （宇）
