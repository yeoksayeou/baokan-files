Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 16th: New York dispatch: As the American economic situation deteriorates, disputes within the American capital groups are also increasing. Currently, members of Congress representing different economic groups are fighting over the issues of cutting Marshall Plan appropriations and the national budget. Although the U.S. Congress passed a bill on April 13th, authorizing a maximum appropriation of $5.43 billion for the second phase of the Marshall Plan (from April 3 this year to June 30 next year), and it was signed into law by Truman, now, when Congress is discussing the actual appropriations, TASS reports that a group of congressmen, shocked by the severity of the economic situation, are trying to cut this appropriation by about one billion dollars. In response, the administrator of the Marshall Plan recently threatened to resign before the Senate Appropriations Committee, saying that unless Congress agrees to allocate the full amount requested by the government, he may resign. Senator McKellar, chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee, told reporters that he doubted "whether Congress will be intimidated." In addition, Senator Maybank, chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, and Senators George (Democrat) and Ferguson (Republican), who are influential among the reactionaries, have told reporters that they intend to continue to promote the struggle to reduce appropriations.

	At the same time, the U.S. Senate Appropriations Committee passed a bill on the 14th to reduce government spending by $2 to $4 billion. According to the Associated Press, the national budget for this fiscal year (July 1 to June 30 next year) is $42 billion, but revenue is only $38.5 billion, with a deficit of $3.5 billion. McKellar said that this bill will be carried out simultaneously with efforts to reduce appropriations for the second phase of the Marshall Plan.

	Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 16th: American stock prices continue to fall and are becoming increasingly serious. According to an Associated Press dispatch from New York on the 13th: "While Wall Street is talking about 'business depression,' the American securities market today fell to its lowest point in four and a half years (American stocks began to fall on May 31, and on June 3 fell to the lowest point since 1948). Major stocks fell another several cents to more than two dollars per share, and some stocks fell about four to seven and a half dollars per share. Although Wall Street has been unhappy and dispirited for months, the pessimistic outlook for the future of the financial district is today exacerbated by another decline in steel production, wage negotiations facing several basic industries, another round of price cuts, and news of production cuts."

　　震惊于经济情况不断恶化
  　美帝内部争吵不休
    证券市场跌落至四年半来最低点
    【新华社北平十六日电】纽约讯：随着美国经济情况的恶化，美国资本集团内部的争吵也日益增加。目前，代表不同经济集团的国会议员，正在削减马歇尔计划拨款与国家预算问题上进行着斗争。虽然四月十三日美国国会通过了五十四亿三千万美元马歇尔第二期（今年四月三日至明年六月三十日）的最高限额的拨款法案，并经杜鲁门签署成为法律，但现在国会在讨论实际拨款时，据塔斯社报道，有一批议员因震惊于经济情况的严重，力图将这一拨款削减少约十亿美元。对此，马歇尔计划执行人最近在参院拨款委员会上曾以辞职相威胁，他说：除非国会同意拨足政府所要求的款项，否则他可能辞职。参院拨款委员会主席麦卡伦则向新闻记者表示：他怀疑国会“是否会被吓退”。此外，参院银行委员会主席梅班克及在反动派中具有影响的参议员乔治（民主党）和费古逊（共和党），都向新闻记者表示，他们打算继续促使减少拨款的斗争。
    与此同时，美国参院拨款委员会十四日通过议案，将政府支出减少二十至四十亿美元。按美联社估计本财政年度（七月一日至明年六月三十日）国家预算为四百二十亿美元，但岁入仅三百八十五亿美元，亏空达三十五亿美元。麦卡伦称：这一议案将与削减马歇尔计划第二期拨款的努力同时进行。
    【新华社北平十六日电】美国股票价格继续下跌而且日益严重。据美联社纽约十三日讯：“在这华尔街纷纷议论‘企业消沉’的时候，美国证券市场今日跌落到四年半以来的最低点（按美国股票自五月三十一日开始跌价，六月三日落至一九四八年以来的最低点）主要的股票每股又下跌数分至两元以上，有些股票每股跌落四元左右至七元五角。华尔街虽然几个月以来就已经怏怏不乐和意气消沉，但是这个金融区企业前途的悲观远景，今日又为钢生产的另一次降落、面临着的若干基本工业的工资谈判、又一批跌价以及要削减生产的消息所加重了”。
