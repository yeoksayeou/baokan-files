　　Tianjin Bank of Communications Pioneers Order-Based Loan with Payment in Kind
    [Tianjin News] Following the establishment of order-based and inflation-adjusted loans, the Tianjin Bank of Communications is now pioneering order-based loans with payment in kind to further ensure that all loans are used for production and to guarantee the supply of raw materials for manufacturers, shielding them from losses due to price fluctuations. The first loan, to the privately-owned Hua Xin Textile and Dyeing Company, was for ten bales of 20-count yarn, equivalent to 22,000 flour sacks. The actual interest rate is 1.2% per month, with a term of 40 days. The contract was signed on the 10th.
    Further news: Of the company's sixty cotton weaving machines, fifty are in operation, except for ten in the West Branch that are temporarily suspended due to electricity difficulties. After receiving the loan in kind from the Bank of Communications, the eighteen silk weaving machines and two woolen fabric machines that had been idle for a long time have now been converted into cotton weaving machines, which can weave flour sacks or commercial cloth. It is estimated that they will be ready to start weaving flour sacks in about ten days.
