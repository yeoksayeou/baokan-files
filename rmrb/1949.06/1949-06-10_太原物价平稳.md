　　Taiyuan Commodity Prices Stable
　　[Taiyuan Dispatch] The exchange of goods between Taiyuan city and the surrounding countryside has become normal, and commodity prices have also stabilized. After the liberation of Taiyuan, agricultural products such as grain and flour once flowed into the city in large quantities from outside, and industrial products from the city also flowed to the outside. However, later, due to the lower prices in the city compared to the surrounding urban and rural areas, the exchange came to a standstill. Except for the trade company's consignment stores selling grain, the transportation of grain from the countryside stopped, and private merchants also stopped selling. Industrial products, on the other hand, experienced a reverse flow, with Taiyuan's foreign cloth flowing to Tianjin and Beijing. Speculative merchants took the opportunity to operate, and industrial and agricultural production suffered. In order to promote the normal exchange of goods between urban and rural areas, the trade company raised its listed prices to a reasonable difference compared to prices in other areas on the 19th of last month. In the past ten days, grain prices have maintained a stable price of 40 yuan per jin for millet and 71 yuan per jin for No. 75 flour. White flour from Qingyuan, Taigu, Xugou, Linfen, Pingyao, and Jiexiu, and millet from Fangshan, Lanxian, Jing Le, and Yangqu, are increasingly being transported into the city. The reverse flow of industrial products has stopped, and Tianjin's Triangle brand cloth, Shijiazhuang's Mountain Deer cloth, and Gaoyang's colored cloth are gradually flowing into Taiyuan. The city's foreign cloth, matches, and dyes are also flowing normally to northern Shanxi, southern Shanxi, and southwestern Shanxi.

　　太原物价平稳
    【太原电】太原市城乡物资交流已趋正常，物价亦臻平稳。太原解放后，城外的粮食、白面等农产品一度大量流入市内，城内的工业品亦流向城外。但后来由于本市物价低于四周城乡，交流即形停顿；市场上除贸易公司之代销处出卖粮食外，乡村粮食停运，私商亦不出卖。工业品则形成倒流，太原的洋布反而流向平津。投机商人趁机活动，工农生产遭受打击。贸易公司为促进城乡物资正常交流，于上月十九日将牌价提到与各地物价达合理差额后，旬日来粮食保持了小米每斤四十元、七五面粉每斤七一元的平稳价格。清源、太谷、徐沟、临汾、平遥、、介休等地之白面，方山、岚县、静乐、阳曲等地之小米，运进该市者日渐增多。工业品倒流现象已经停止，天津的三角牌布、石庄的山鹿布、高阳的色布逐渐流入太原；该市之洋布、火柴、染料也正常地流向晋北、晋南、晋西南等地。
