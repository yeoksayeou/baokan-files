　　Xinhua News Agency, Peiping, 10th: TASS reports: Representatives from progressive youth groups in fifteen American states, totaling 265 people, recently convened a meeting in Washington on the 4th and 5th, hosted by the American Progressive Youth Society, to discuss the economic problems facing American youth and to formulate a program to address these problems. The program emphasized that American youth are in a period of growing economic crisis and the threat of war, and the economic burden is becoming increasingly heavy. The current government is threatening world peace and happiness through the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, and is making the economic situation even worse. Therefore, American youth, through this meeting, indicated that they are unwilling to remain silent about this. American progressive youth recognize that every current economic conference must demand that economic rights be combined with peace. The program pointed out that the number of unemployed people in the United States has now exceeded five million.
    At the opening of the meeting, speakers unanimously emphasized that the American economic crisis is developing, and the first to be hit are young people. It is estimated that workers under the age of 35 account for 50 percent of the unemployed. The meeting passed a resolution stating: "We are facing the threat of war, as well as the threat of conscription and universal military training. Hundreds of millions of dollars in military spending are worsening our work and living conditions, and causing unemployment for millions of young people. Today, we have no security and no peace!"
    The resolution calls for the abolition of racial discrimination in employment, wages, and education, and protests that the current Congress is willing to spend 16 billion US dollars on armaments, while only 2.6 billion US dollars are used for the needs of the American people. In addition, the conference also passed a resolution condemning the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, calling on American youth to fight for peace and to smash the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.

　　面临经济危机和战争威胁
  　美国进步青年集会制定共同斗争纲领
    【新华社北平十日电】塔斯社讯：美国十五州进步青年团体的代表二百六十五人，顷在美国进步青年社主持之下，于四、五两日在华盛顿开会，讨论美国青年所面临的一些经济问题，并制定出对付这些问题的纲领。该纲领强调指出美国青年处在日益增长的经济危机和战争威胁的时期里，经济负担是愈来愈沉重了。现在的政府正通过北大西洋公约，来威胁世界和平与幸福，并使经济状况更趋恶化。因此，美国青年经由这个会议表明他们不愿对这保持沉默。美国进步青年认识到，目前的每一次经济会议，必须要求把经济权利与和平结合起来。该纲领指出，现在美国失业人数已超过了五百万。
    会议开幕时各发言者一致强调指出，美国经济危机已在发展中，首先受到打击的是青年们，估计在失业人数中，三十五岁以下的工人占百分之五十。会议通过一项决议，内称：“我们面临着战争的威胁，以及征兵与普遍军训的威胁。亿万元的军备支出，使我们的工作和生活情况更加恶化，并造成数百万青年的失业。今日我们没有安全，也没有和平！”
    决议案要求废除在就业、工资、教育中的种族歧视，并抗议本届国会情愿化费一百六十亿美元在军备上，而用在美国人民需要上的只有二十六亿美元。此外，大会并通过了斥责北大西洋公约的决议案，号召美国青年必须为争取和平及粉碎北大西洋公约而斗争。
