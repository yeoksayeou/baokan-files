Farmer Representative Zhu Fusheng

　　Farmer representative Zhu Fusheng's family line had been tenants for three generations. His grandfather was a hired hand and tenant farmer his whole life, and didn't wear shoes for twenty years. His father was first a tenant farmer and then a beggar; Zhu Fusheng began his life of begging at the age of seven or eight. In 1929, he herded cattle for others, and his family lived on one catty of soybeans for seven days. Later, he tilled the land for landlords. There was a landlord's old wife who came to and fro between the front and back houses every day. The front and back houses were about half a kilometer apart, and Zhu Fusheng had to carry her. Once he forgot to carry her, and the landlord flew into a rage, threatening to take back the land, even saying that Zhu Fusheng had "forgotten his roots." Those were difficult days! Zhu Fusheng was forced into a state that was not human.

　　In 1945, the Communist Party and the Eighth Route Army came, and a democratic government was established. Zhu Fusheng actively participated in the work, serving as village head. In September, the puppet police arrested him, poured cold water on him seven times, and forced him to reveal the whereabouts of the Eighth Route Army. Zhu Fusheng was resolute and unyielding, "He would rather die than speak." He really had not forgotten his roots! He continued to work diligently until rent reduction, interest reduction, and land reform, and finally, along with other peasant brothers, he turned over. He is a famous hero who participated in the war, and once led three hundred stretcher-bearers. He personally participated in the famous Menglianggu Campaign and Huaihai Campaign.

　　Having participated in the preparatory meeting of the New Political Consultative Conference, he "looked at his current position and thought about the past suffering," and was filled with emotion. He said, "I have participated in the war in many newly liberated areas, and I can't help but shed tears when I see the poor people suffering there. I often think, don't forget your roots." Therefore, he hopes that the united government will be established as soon as possible to liberate the people suffering in the Kuomintang-controlled areas. He said, if everyone lives a good life, the whole country will be well governed.

　　农民代表朱富胜
    农民代表朱富胜的祖系三代当过三辈子佃户。祖父终身当雇工、佃户，二十年没有穿过鞋。父亲先当佃户后要饭；朱富胜在七、八岁时就开始了乞讨的生活。民国十八年给人家放牛，一家人七天里过一斤豆子。以后又替地主种地。有个地主老婆子，每天来往前、后宅一趟。前、后宅相距一里路，朱富胜要抬着她。有一次忘了抬，地主大发臭脾气，威胁着要退地，竟说朱富胜“忘了本”。那是艰难的日子啊！朱富胜被逼迫得不象人样子。
    一九四五年，共产党、八路军来了，成立起民主政府。朱富胜积极参加工作，当了庄长。九月里，伪警察捉住他，灌七次凉水，逼问八路军在什么地方。朱富胜坚决顽强，“宁死不说”，他实在没有忘本呀！工作再工作，一直到减租减息、土地改革，终于和其他农民弟兄一起翻身了。他是一个著名的参战英雄，曾经率领过三百副担架。有名的孟良崮战役和淮海战役，他都亲身参加过。
    参加了新政协筹备会，他“看看今天的地位，想想过去的痛苦”，感慨是很多的。他说：“我参战到过许多新解放区，看见那里受苦的穷人，忍不住掉眼泪。我常想，可别忘了本。”他因而希望：赶快把联合政府成立起来，解放国统区受苦受难的人们。他说：大家都过起好日子，整个国家也就治理好了。
