    Xinhua News Agency, Hankou, June 24th. The state-owned Shihuyao Huaxin Cement Factory resumed operations on the 12th, producing 350 tons of cement per day. This factory originally belonged to the Kuomintang Resource Committee. At the end of last year, it purchased two new machines from the United States, but only began producing cement at the end of April this year. Due to the factory's economic exhaustion and the fact that employees had not been paid for three months, coupled with a lack of sales, it ceased production after only one month, producing only over 2,300 tons of cement. In mid-May, when the White bandits retreated, they forced the factory to relocate and attempted to sabotage it. However, through the efforts of all factory employees to protect it, the factory and machines were undamaged. After the liberation of Wuhan, the Wuhan Military Control Commission sent personnel to take over, adopting a policy of taking over and producing simultaneously. It successively issued temporary living allowances of rice and cash to each employee. The Central China Trade Corporation also purchased 150 tons of inventory from the factory. The factory was then able to quickly resume operations.

    汉口华新水泥厂日产三百五十吨
    【新华社汉口二十四日电】国营石灰窑华新水泥工厂已于十二日复工，日产水泥三百五十吨。该厂原属国民党资源委员会，于前年底曾自美国购回两部新型机器，但至今年四月底才开始出产水泥。由于厂内经济枯竭，员工三个月没有发薪，加上外无销路，开工仅一月，即告停工，共出产水泥仅二千三百余吨。五月中旬，白匪溃退时，曾迫令该厂搬迁，并意图破坏，经全厂员工多方设法保护，工厂、机器均完好无损。武汉解放后，武汉市军管会派员接管，采取一面接管一面生产的方针，先后发给每个员工临时生活维持费大米和现款。华中贸易总公司又先后向该厂购买存货一百五十吨。该工厂乃迅速得以复工。
