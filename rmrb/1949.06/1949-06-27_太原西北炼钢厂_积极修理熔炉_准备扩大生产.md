Taiyuan Northwest Steel Plant
	Actively Repairs Furnaces
	Preparing to Expand Production
	[Taiyuan Electric] The Taiyuan Northwest Steel Plant is repairing and installing the No. 2 Martin furnace and the No. 2 ore smelting furnace, preparing to expand production. The steel plant has two 30-ton Martin furnaces. During the Yan Xishan bandit regime, due to raw material difficulties, only one was operating. The No. 2 Martin furnace, after eight months of continuous steelmaking, was damaged and not repaired. It was in a state of disrepair at the time of liberation. After the takeover, only the No. 1 Martin furnace was used for steel tapping. In order to expand production, the steel plant began repairing the No. 2 Martin furnace on the 11th, planning to begin baking the furnace when repairs are completed on July 20th, and to tap steel in mid-August. In addition, the steel plant has one No. 1 50-ton ore smelting furnace and one No. 2 150-ton ore smelting furnace. During the Yan Xishan bandit regime, only the No. 1 furnace was in operation. After liberation, in addition to continuing to operate the No. 1 furnace, the repair and installation of the No. 2 150-ton ore smelting furnace began on June 15th, with plans to complete the repairs by mid-October, begin baking the furnace and loading the furnace for test runs in November, and officially tap iron on January 1st of next year.

　　太原西北炼钢厂
  　积极修理熔炉
  　准备扩大生产
    【太原电】太原市西北炼钢厂修理按装二号马丁炉和第二号熔矿炉，准备扩大生产。炼钢厂有三十吨马丁炉两座，阎匪统治时期，因原料困难，只开一座；第二号马丁炉在连续炼钢八个月后，机器损坏未加修理，解放时，即破乱不堪。接管后，也只开第一号马丁炉出钢。为了扩大生产，十一日炼钢厂开始修理第二号马丁炉，计划七月二十日修理完成时即开始烤炉，八月中旬出钢。此外炼钢厂有一号五十吨熔矿炉一座，二号一百五十吨熔矿炉一座。阎匪统治时一直只开着第一号熔矿炉。解放后，除继续开第一号炉外，六月十五日开始修理按装第二号一百五十吨熔矿炉，计划在十月中旬修理完毕，十一月开始烤炉和装炉试车，明年一月一日正式出铁。
