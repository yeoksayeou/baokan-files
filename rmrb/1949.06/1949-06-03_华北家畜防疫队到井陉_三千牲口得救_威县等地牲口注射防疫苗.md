[Chahar News] Last year, Jingxing livestock suffered from jaundice, resulting in many deaths, leading some farmers to sell their livestock and avoid raising them. Jaundice reoccurred this spring, with statistics from five villages showing 25 deaths in February and March alone, prompting desperate farmers to say, "Let's sell them; we can't raise livestock anymore!" The North China Livestock Epidemic Prevention Office dispatched an epidemic prevention team to Jingxing on April 25th to vaccinate livestock. On the first day at the Seventh District office alone, 150 livestock were vaccinated. In Tasi Ping, two livestock that were near death from jaundice were cured with two injections. The grateful owner said, "If it weren't for you, I would have lost half of my livelihood." As of May 22nd, nearly 3,000 livestock in the county had been vaccinated. All vaccinated livestock not only did not develop new illnesses, but also recovered from old ones. The epidemic prevention team is currently focusing on the First and Second Districts, and the county's livestock disease disaster will soon be completely eliminated. (Wang Jing)
[Taihang News] The Veterinary Treatment Team of the Agricultural College of North China University, Xingtai Work Station, set off on May 1st to conduct epidemic prevention and treatment in the disease-stricken areas of the Fourth and Sixth Districts of Xingtai. Within nine days, they injected a total of 606 livestock, administered medicine to 167 sick livestock, and gave acupuncture to 235 sick livestock. All sick livestock treated by the team members have improved, and they have been warmly welcomed by the masses. (Fu Sheng, Bing Cheng)
[Jizhong Electric] The livestock epidemic prevention team organized by the Agricultural Department of the Jizhong Administrative Office has achieved good results in Rongcheng. The team of thirteen people set off on the 11th of this month, divided into two groups to treat the most severely affected areas of the First and Second Districts. The First District mainly treated swine fever, and the Second District treated livestock. In the First District, they cured ten pigs in three days. In the Second District, they used traditional Chinese medicine to cure twenty-two livestock (mules, horses, and donkeys). They also used anthrax vaccine to inject 118 mules and horses in Xiniu Ying and other villages in the Fourth District. They also conducted examinations, treatments, and propaganda at the market. At that time, villagers from various villages in the Fifth District requested the epidemic prevention team to come to their villages for treatment. The Agricultural Department of the Jizhong Administrative Office has now sent people to Beijing, Cangzhou, and Wanxian to purchase serum vaccines for widespread treatment and prevention.
[Jinan Electric] After the North China Veterinary Epidemic Prevention Team arrived in Jinan in late April, the Administrative Office specially dispatched seven veterinarians, including Director Zhang of the Jinan Veterinary Hospital, to cooperate with the team in conducting point-to-line epidemic prevention and treatment in Linqing, Handan, Xiazhen, Weixian, and other places. As of early May, in the past half month, the animal epidemics in the urban areas of Weixian, Guangzong, Pingxiang, Linqing and fourteen towns and villages including Lihuai have been treated. A total of 2,390 livestock have been injected with cattle plague and anthrax vaccines, and 30 sick cattle have been treated. The epidemic prevention team is welcomed by the masses everywhere. In Luzhai and Yaozhuang in the Sixth District of Linqing, the village cadres busily cleaned up housing and promoted the news to the masses two days before the arrival of the epidemic prevention team. When the epidemic prevention team arrived, the masses brought their cattle for treatment. In one day, more than one hundred cattle were vaccinated.
