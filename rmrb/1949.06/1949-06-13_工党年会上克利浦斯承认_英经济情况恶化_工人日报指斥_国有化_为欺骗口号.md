Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 11th -- Reports from various sources: The Labour Party's 48th Annual Conference, which began on the 6th, continues in Blackpool. British Prime Minister Attlee and Chancellor of the Exchequer Cripps delivered reports to the conference on the 7th. In his report, Attlee praised the "Western European Union" and the "North Atlantic Treaty" as the "achievements" of Bevin's diplomacy. Cripps' report partially revealed the current grim economic situation in Britain. He admitted that the shortage of US dollars in Britain's foreign trade amounts to 300 million pounds annually, and exports in the first four months of this year fell by 14 percent compared to the last four months of last year. He also admitted that Britain's economic situation "remains serious" and that the "economic barometer is indeed constantly rising." However, Cripps dared not tell a truth: that Britain's deteriorating economic situation is the result of the Labour government's reactionary policy of acting as a pawn of US imperialism and engaging in an arms race. He tried his best to defend his "guns instead of butter" budget for this year, demanding that British workers "work harder and sweat more." After Cripps' speech, many trade union representatives from local trade unions raised demands to reduce retail tax, lower prices, and abolish wage freezes. However, these demands were rejected by the conference, which was manipulated by Labour Party bureaucrats.

On the 7th, the conference elected a new executive committee, and on the 8th, former Labour Party Deputy Chairman Watson and female MP Beaken were elected as the new chairman and vice-chairman of the Labour Party, respectively. On the 8th, the most notable event was the adoption of the Labour Party's platform for the next general election. The main content of the platform is to advocate for the nationalization of six more British industries. The Labour government, apparently in view of its failures in the recent county and city elections, is trying to repeat the deceptive slogan of "socialist nationalization" from the 1945 election in order to relive its old dream of victory in the upcoming general election. But everyone knows that the Labour Party's past "nationalization" actions have not harmed British monopoly capital in the slightest, and the six enterprises that the program advocates for nationalization this time are only relatively minor enterprises such as sugar production, life insurance, cement, and meat wholesale. For larger enterprises such as shipbuilding and chemicals, the program only vaguely expresses "the possibility of studying their nationalization."

The British Worker's Daily, in criticizing the program, said: This is a useless program. Because the Labour Party's foreign policy and political and economic policies have not changed, it is therefore impossible to seriously resist the coming crisis.

　　工党年会上克利浦斯承认
  　英经济情况恶化
    工人日报指斥“国有化”为欺骗口号
    【新华社北平十一日电】各方报道：六日开始的工党第四十八届年会，继续在布拉克普尔举行。英首相艾德礼与财相克里浦斯七日向大会作了报告。艾德礼在报告中赞扬“西欧联盟”、“北大西洋公约”是贝文外交的“成绩”。克里浦斯的报告，部分地透露了英国当前恶劣的经济形势。他承认，英国对外贸易中美元不足年达三亿镑，今年头四个月的输出较去年最后四个月的输出跌了百分之十四。他又承认：英国的经济情况“目前仍然严重”，“经济气压表确乎不断升高”。但克利浦斯不敢说出一个真理：即英国恶化的经济情势是工党政府执行充当美帝国主义走卒和军备竞赛的反动政策的结果。他竭力为他的“大炮代替牛油”的本年度预算辩护，要求英国劳工“作更多苦役，流更多汗”。在克氏发言后，许多工会的地方工会代表提出削减零售税、降低物价、废除冻结工资的要求。但这些要求均被工党官僚们所操纵的大会所否决。
    七日，会议选举了新的执委会，并于八日选出前工党副主席瓦特逊与女议员倍肯分任工党的新的正副主席。在八日会议上，最引人注意的是工党在下届大选中竞选政纲的通过。该政纲的主要内容是主张再将英国六种工业收归国有。工党政府显然鉴于它在最近郡、市选举中的失败，力图重复它在一九四五年选举中“社会主义国有化”的欺骗口号，以便在即将到来的大选中重温其获胜的旧梦。但尽人皆知，工党过去的“国有化”行动，并未损及英国独占资本的一丝一毫，而且这次纲领所主张收归国有的六种企业，只是制糖、人寿保险、水泥、肉类批发等比较次要的企业，对于造船及化学等较大的企业，纲领中只是含糊地表示“研究其收归国有的可能”。
    英工人日报在抨击该纲领时说：这是一个无用的纲领。由于工党外交政策与政治经济方针的没有改变，因此也就不可能对于即将到来的危机进行认真的抵抗。
