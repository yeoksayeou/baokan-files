Xinhua News Agency, Peiping, June 23rd: TASS, Moscow, June 21st: *Pravda* published an article by Zhukov entitled "The Results of the Paris Foreign Ministers' Conference." The author wrote: Although the four foreign ministers were unable to reach an agreement on fundamental issues regarding Germany, the results of the Paris Conference mark definite progress in consolidating cooperation. For the first time since December 1946, the Foreign Ministers' Conference adopted a number of unanimous decisions. First, the foreign ministers reached agreement on the most important clauses of the Austrian peace treaty, clauses which had caused such stubborn disagreements for two and a half years. The agreement reached by the foreign ministers this time lays the foundation for completing the drafting of the Austrian peace treaty. Second, the foreign ministers decided to continue their efforts to restore the political and economic unity of Germany. Third, the foreign ministers plan to convene the next foreign ministers' conference to discuss the German question.

Undoubtedly, the decisions passed by the Foreign Ministers' Conference will be met with satisfaction by the broad public. They will regard these decisions as one of the concrete results of the struggle waged by the democratic camp headed by the Soviet Union to defend peace and consolidate international cooperation. On the other hand, the world's public will also see from the positive results of the Paris Conference proof of the failure of the aggressive policies of the ruling groups in Western countries. For several years, these ruling groups have tried to politically and economically isolate the Soviet Union, and sought to resolve major international issues, especially the German question, behind the Soviet Union's back and according to their own wishes.

    评巴黎外长会议结果
    在德国基本问题上虽未协议，却标志着巩固合作的确定进展。
    【新华社北平二十三日电】塔斯社莫斯科二十一日讯：真理报刊载朱可夫一文，题为“巴黎外长会议的结果”。作者写道：虽然四国外长没有能够在关于德国的基本问题上达到协议，但是，巴黎会议的结果，却标志着在巩固合作上的确定的进展。自一九四六年十二月以来，外长会议第一次采取了一些协议一致的决定。第一，外长们在对奥和约的最重要的条款上达到了协议，这些条款曾造成两年半来如此顽固的分歧。外长们这次达到协议，就建立了完成对奥和约起草工作的基础。第二，外长们决定继续努力，以达恢复德国政治与经济的统一。第三，外长们拟召集下次外长会议讨论德国问题。
    无疑地，外长会议通过的决定，将得到广大公众满意的反应。他们将把这些决定看作是以苏联为首的民主阵营保卫和平与巩固国际合作的斗争的具体结果之一。另一方面，全世界的公众，还将从巴黎会议的积极结果，证明西方国家统治集团侵略政策的失败。几年以来，这些统治集团力图从政治上和经济上孤立苏联，想背着苏联随他们的意愿解决重大的国际问题，特别是德国问题。
