Democratic figures Li Jishen, Shen Junru, Zhang Bojun, Huang Yanpei, Guo Moruo, Chen Shutong, Ma Xulun, Tan Pingshan, Peng Zemin, Li Zhangda, Cai Tingkai, and Chen Qiyou sent a telegram to Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu today, congratulating them on the liberation of Shanghai and other cities. The telegram reads:

To Chairman Mao of the Revolutionary Military Commission of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, Commander-in-Chief Zhu of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, and all commanders and fighters of the various field armies of the Chinese People's Liberation Army:

Since the liberation of Nanjing, in just one month, the heroic People's Liberation Army has successively liberated major cities such as Hangzhou, Wuhan, Xi'an, Nanchang, and Shanghai, as well as vast areas. Wherever the army goes, it is unstoppable, and the people are rescued and overjoyed. This demonstrates the correctness of the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, the greatness of the People's Liberation Army's strength, and also demonstrates that the 475 million people of China fervently support the revolutionary war and have sufficient strength to complete the tasks of anti-imperialism, anti-feudalism, and anti-bureaucratic capitalism under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party. This is a glorious and unparalleled great era in Chinese history. Amidst our joy and excitement, we are willing to do our utmost under the banner of Chairman Mao to fight to the end for the complete liberation of the people and the construction of a new democratic China. We send this telegram with respect.

Li Jishen, Shen Junru, Zhang Bojun, Huang Yanpei, Guo Moruo, Chen Shutong, Ma Xulun, Tan Pingshan, Peng Zemin, Li Zhangda, Cai Tingkai, Chen Qiyou, May 31st.

Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, May 31st: Zhang Lan, Luo Longji, Shi Liang and others recently jointly sent a telegram to Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu, congratulating them on the great victory of liberating Shanghai. The original telegram is as follows:

Chairman Mao Runzhi, Commander-in-Chief Zhu Yu Jie Xun Jian: After our People's Liberation Army crossed the Yangtze River, the Chiang bandit reactionary clique completely collapsed and disintegrated at the mere sight of our forces. Now, our People's Liberation Army has once again liberated Shanghai, the largest industrial and commercial city in East Asia, with swift and agile actions, allowing six million citizens to see hope in the midst of severe drought and to witness light again in the darkness, which is truly gratifying. This time, the Chiang bandit reactionary clique vainly hoped to use Shanghai's manpower and resources as a sacrifice for their final death throes, looting property, massacring the people, and even using the barbaric means of collective responsibility to kill countless democratic figures. The Chiang bandit gang dared to do everything that robbers and bandits would be ashamed to do. And our Liberation Army, with its righteous banner, strict discipline, and no offense to the people, fully demonstrated the spirit of saving and loving the people, which was cheered by all and praised by the world. This contrast between benevolence and brutality, light and darkness, is truly a great miracle in the glorious victory of the people's revolution. Amidst our excitement and joy, we send this telegram to congratulate you.

Zhang Lan, Luo Longji, Shi Liang, Guo Chuntao, Yang Hu, Chen Mingshu, Min Ganghou, Feng Yidai, Lian Ruiqi, Wang Jiyi, Yang Weiyu, Hu Juewen

    【新华社上海三十一日电】张澜、罗隆基、史良等顷联名电毛主席、朱总司令，庆贺解放大上海的伟大胜利，原电如下：
    毛主席润之朱总司令玉阶勋鉴：我人民解放军渡过长江以后，蒋匪反动集团全面土崩瓦解，望风披靡。今我人民解放军又以迅速敏捷行动，解放东亚工商业最大都市上海，使六百万市民大旱得见云霓，黑暗重睹光明，诚堪庆贺。此次蒋匪反动集团妄冀以上海之人力物力，为彼辈临死前最后挣扎之牺牲品，抢劫财物，屠杀人民，甚至以连保连坐格杀勿论野蛮手段，杀害无数民主人士。凡强盗土匪所羞耻而不肯为者，蒋匪帮竟敢一一为之。而我解放军则义旗所指，纪律严明，秋毫无犯，秩序井然，充分发扬救民爱民之精神，万民腾欢，举世赞誉。此种仁爱与残暴、光明与黑暗之对照，实为人民革命史上光荣胜利之伟大奇迹。同人鼓舞欢欣之余，谨电致贺。
