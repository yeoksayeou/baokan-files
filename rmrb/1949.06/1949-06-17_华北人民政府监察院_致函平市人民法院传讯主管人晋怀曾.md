　　Huabei People's Government Supervisory Yuan
  　Sends Letter to Ping City People's Court Summoning Person in Charge, Jin Huaizeng
    [Reported by this newspaper] The Huabei People's Government Supervisory Yuan recently issued a letter to the Beiping City People's Court regarding the fire in the laboratory of the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant, requesting that Jin Huaizeng, the person in charge, be summoned for interrogation. The original letter is as follows:
    Regarding the fire in the laboratory of the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant on May 25th, the Public Enterprise Department, the Public Security Department, the Public Security Bureau of the Beiping Municipal People's Government, the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, and the Preparatory Committee of the Beiping Municipal Federation of Trade Unions, among other agencies, dispatched personnel to inspect and hold meetings for review. Although the cause of the fire in the laboratory was due to the negligence of the worker Zhao Jinji, who fell asleep while on the night shift and failed to diligently guard the premises, Jin Huaizeng, the person in charge of the laboratory, bears the primary responsibility for consistently neglecting his duties, failing to conduct inspections or provide supervision. The plant was only recently taken over and is still in the initial stages of construction, and the laboratory serves as the experimental and guidance institution for the plant's production technology, which is of utmost importance. Jin Huaizeng, the person in charge, had previously failed to properly design the muffle furnace and, on this occasion, failed to thoroughly inspect the potential impact before allowing its use. Furthermore, he failed to assign appropriate personnel for round-the-clock watch and strict supervision, demonstrating a careless and negligent attitude, resulting in significant damage to state property, which cannot be attributed to mere accidental oversight. In order to uphold the law and discipline and educate all cadres, the chairman of this government has ordered the removal of the said individual from his post and instructed this Yuan to transfer him to your court for interrogation. We are enclosing the inspection reports from the Public Enterprise Department, the Public Security Department, the Public Security Bureau of the Beiping Municipal People's Government, the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, the Preparatory Committee of the Beiping Municipal Federation of Trade Unions, and this Yuan. We kindly request that you promptly investigate the case, conduct a thorough interrogation in accordance with the law, and inform this Yuan of the trial proceedings.
