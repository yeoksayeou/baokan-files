Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 2nd. Shanghai's millions of workers and students gathered and paraded on the 30th to commemorate the first "May Thirtieth" after liberation. Nanjing Road, where Shanghai's workers, students, and citizens shed blood twenty-four years ago, has now taken on a new look. A huge portrait of Chairman Mao, occupying four floors of the International Hotel building, hung high, with the large red characters "Chairman Mao calls us to advance" written below. Large banners and red flags hung on the high buildings of many large companies, and countless parades of workers and students passed through here. Countless worker and student Yangko teams and propaganda trucks poured into Nanjing Road from all directions, and then dispersed in all directions. With the enthusiasm of masters, the masses sang revolutionary songs such as "Follow the Communist Party," applauded, shouted slogans, gave speeches, and presented flowers to the People's Liberation Army. Many factory trade unions held rallies of thousands of people, and literary and art associations and major middle school students went deep into factories and held meetings with their worker brothers, and performed Yangko report performances and other consolation performances. More than a thousand employees of the China Textile Construction Company warmly welcomed female worker leaders Tang Guifen and Fan Xiaofeng, who represented them at the victorious return of the Sixth National Labor Congress, at the commemorative meeting. Tang Guifen called on everyone to increase production and support the front lines as masters, and to step up organization to fight against hidden enemies. The Trade Union of the Department Store Industry in the Third District held a grand welcoming meeting of more than 1,500 people to welcome Han Wucheng, Deputy Director of the China National Products Company Branch of the Union, and 30 others who had been forced to flee due to persecution by the Kuomintang bandits and have now returned victoriously from the liberated areas. Han Wucheng is now an alternate member of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions. He reported on the situation of the Sixth National Labor Congress held in Harbin last year, and called on employees to unite and work hard for the construction of new democracy. More than 500 employee representatives from the Yangshupu Power Plant of Shanghai Electric Power Company solemnly mourned the martyr Wang Xiaohe, the executive director of the trade union, at the commemorative meeting. Zhang Shibao, the chairman of the meeting, said excitedly: "Shanghai is liberated, and our workers can stand up straight. We must work hard to restore power so that every blood vessel in Greater Shanghai beats." Xin Yuying, the wife of martyr Wang Xiaohe, accepted everyone's condolences and asked everyone to avenge her husband, "We must support the People's Liberation Army to fight to Guangzhou and capture the Kuomintang executioners alive." Employees of the Shanghai General Factory of China Agricultural Machinery Company and Shenxin No. 5 Factory resumed work on this day to commemorate "May Thirtieth." Grand commemorative meetings with more than a thousand people were also held by French Electric Power Company, International Radio Station, Telecommunications Bureau, Public Transportation Company, Jiangnan Shipyard, China Textile No. 3 Factory, and China Textile No. 2 Factory. Guanghua University, founded twenty-four years ago by patriotic professors and students of St. John's University, also warmly held a commemorative "May Thirtieth" and preparatory meeting for the resumption of school. The student cultural circles' commemorative "May Thirtieth" meeting, initiated by the Shanghai Student Union, Shanghai Education Association, and China Technology Association, was held on the 31st.
