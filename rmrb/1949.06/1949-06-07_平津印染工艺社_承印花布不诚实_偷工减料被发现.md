　　Pingjin Dyeing and Printing Arts Cooperative Dishonestly Prints Calico, Skimping on Materials is Discovered
　　[Our Newspaper's Report] The Ping Trade Company's Cotton Yarn and Cloth Branch discovered theft of cloth ends and skimping on materials when entrusting private factories to print calico. The Cotton Yarn and Cloth Branch, in order to support the private dyeing and weaving industry, had entrusted a large number of dyeing and weaving factories to carry out dyeing and weaving processing. On May 18th, the company signed a contract with the Pingjin Dyeing and Printing Arts Cooperative in this city, stipulating that the Pingjin Dyeing and Printing Arts Cooperative would undertake the printing of 500 bolts of calico, stating that the printing cost was 1,100 yuan per bolt, with specific flower pattern regulations, and the delivery was due before May 30th, and it was forbidden to cut them open privately. Unexpectedly, the cooperative not only failed to fulfill the contract, but deliberately skimped on materials and arbitrarily changed to printing large flowers (the original agreement was to print small flowers), resulting in difficult sales, and privately cut open entire bolts of foreign cloth, stealing the cloth ends. After investigation and persuasion by the Cotton Yarn and Cloth Company, the manager of the cooperative, seeing that the facts were undeniable and could no longer be concealed, admitted the mistakes of skimping on materials and stealing more than 200 yards of cloth ends. He also handed over most of the stolen cloth ends, expressing remorse. The company, in addition to immediately ceasing entrusted processing to the cooperative, is also requesting instructions from relevant departments for appropriate handling.

　　平津印染工艺社　承印花布不诚实　偷工减料被发现
    【本报讯】平贸易公司花纱布分公司于委托私营工厂印染花布中，发现有窃取布头和偷工减料情形。花纱布分公司为扶植私营染织业曾委托大批染织工厂进行染织加工。该公司于五月十八日与本市平津印染工艺社订立合同，由平津印染工艺社承印花布五百匹，言明每匹印工一千一百元，花样具体规定，限五月三十日前交清，不准私自剪开。不料该工艺社不仅未履行契约所定，蓄意偷工减料擅自改印大花（原约定印小花）致使销售困难，并且私自剪开整匹洋布，窃取布头。经花纱布公司调查与说服，该社经理见事实具在不能再行掩饰，承认偷工减料和窃取布头二百余码等错误。并将所窃布头大部交出，表示悔过，该公司对该工艺社除即停止委托加工外并正请示有关部门酌情处理。
