Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 11th: Remnants of the Kuomintang bandit gang are carrying out various conspiracies abroad. War criminal Song Ziwen, after staying in Paris for more than a week, transferred to New York on the 8th of this month to carry out activities. Gan Jiehou, who went to the United States in mid-May under the title of "Foreign Ministry Advisor" of the bandit regime, was accompanied by Gu Weijun, the bandit "Ambassador to the United States," to meet with former U.S. Secretary of State Marshall, who had retired, on the 6th. The Kuomintang "Central Propaganda Department," which fled to Guangzhou, issued a secret instruction on the 30th of May to its party newspapers and party headquarters in various provinces and cities regarding the bandit party's "diplomatic policy," claiming that the bandit party "Central" had decided to "find ways to promote American military, financial and economic assistance," "find ways to promote the establishment of a Pacific Pact," and "should adopt an active friendly policy towards Japan and avoid being in a position contrary to the United States' policy towards Japan," fully exposing the traitorous features of the remnant Kuomintang bandit gang, which has only a few days left to live.

  　在国外阴谋活动
    【新华社北平十一日电】残余的国民党匪帮正在国外进行种种阴谋活动。战犯宋子文在巴黎停留一个多礼拜后，又于本月八日转赴纽约活动。上月中旬以匪“外交部顾问”名义赴美的甘介侯，曾于六日由匪“驻美大使”顾维钧陪同往见已退职之前美国务卿马歇尔。逃亡在广州的国民党“中央宣传部”曾于五月三十日向其各党报、各省市党部发出关于匪党“外交政策”的秘密指示一件，声称匪党“中央”已决定“设法促进美国军事、财政及经济援助”、“设法促进太平洋公约之成立”、“对日应采取主动的友好政策，并避免与美国对日政策处于相反地位”，充分暴露出已经没有几天寿命的残余国民党匪帮的汉奸面目。
