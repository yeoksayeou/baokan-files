　　Energetically Repairing Railway Bridges in Northeast and North China
  　Remarkable Achievements of the Railway Engineering Corps
    Currently Rushing to Repair the Huai River Bridge and Other Projects
    [Report from this newspaper] The four detachments of the Chinese People's Liberation Army Railway Engineering Corps have achieved great results in their efforts to repair railways and restore transportation in the past nine months, and have also made rapid progress in technology. In July of last year, the unit first focused on repairing the railway lines in the Northeast, including the Qingfu (Qingyuan to Marshal Lin), Jichang (Xinglongshan to Yinma River), Beining (Jinzhou to Shanhaiguan), Xinyi (Xinlitun to Shala), Jingu (Jinzhou to Yixian), Gaoxin (Gaotaishan to Xinlitun), Xinyi (West Fuxin to Yixian), Hachang (Changchun to Second Songhua River), Sichang (Siping to Changchun), and Dazheng (Xinlitun to Paozi) lines. A total of 535 kilometers and 796 meters of lines were repaired, including track, bridges, water supply, signaling communications, and some construction projects. Then, at the beginning of the Pingjin Campaign, in order to transport a large number of troops into the customs, the First and Fourth Detachments actively repaired the Beining Railway: the First Detachment repaired 35 kilometers and 360 meters of track and 28 sets of switches in six days in December of last year, and repaired the entire section between Beidaihe and Houfengtai, averaging 7 kilometers and 72 meters of track repaired per day. The Fourth Detachment began repairing the section from Houfengtai to Luanhe on January 1st of this year, repairing 28 kilometers and 130 meters of track, averaging 4 kilometers and 68 meters per day. The repair of the Chen Guantun to Sangzidian section of the Jinpu Railway in the north was completed on March 25th. The line totaled 297 kilometers, 139 meters and 76 sets of switches. At the same time as the above line repairs, the great project of repairing bridges was also launched. In the past nine months, a total of 139 bridges have been repaired, including 105 damaged bridges with 460 spans on the Hachang Line, Changtu Line, Gaoxin Line, Shenji Line, Jingu Line, and Beining Line; three culverts, 67 bridge abutments, and 261 bridge piers. On February 18th of this year, temporary and permanent bridges were all repaired. In North China: since the Northeast Field Army entered the customs in December, the First and Fourth Detachments first repaired the section from Shanhaiguan to Luanxian, and then repaired the Jinxi River section. They then began preparing to repair the bridges on the Jinpu, Longhai, Pinghan, and Beining lines, a total of 81 large and small damaged bridges, with 215 spans, and 209 culverts. According to materials from before April 7th, 34 permanent and temporary bridges, with 89 spans, and 160 culverts have been repaired, and 44 bridges are still under repair. In the Jinpu Railway repair project, the Fourth Detachment was responsible for two sections: the first section was from Chen Guantun to Cangxian, and the second section was from Cangxian to Dongguang. These two sections started construction on February 4th and March 4th respectively, and were completed on February 27th and March 17th respectively, saving 70 workdays per kilometer compared to the original plan of 400 workdays, exceeding the plan. However, there are still some shortcomings in the overall work, such as some areas where the technology is not proficient, and the spikes and sleepers are all locally produced, the spikes are soft, and the sleepers are hard, so some spikes are only driven into the sleepers by four or five millimeters before they come loose, some spike heads are hit off-center, and even some sleepers are cracked due to the spikes being driven in. In order to overcome the above problems, while strengthening technical and political studies, they are intensively rushing to repair the Huai River Bridge and Zhumadian and other bridges. The Railway Engineering Corps is actually playing a great role as the main force in the restoration and construction of the People's Railways, becoming a powerful and excellent technical arm of the Chinese People's Liberation Army.

　　大力修复东北华北铁路桥梁
  　铁道兵团功绩卓著
    现正抢修淮河大桥等工程
    【本报讯】中国人民解放军铁道兵团四个支队在九个月来全力抢修铁路、恢复交通上获得很大成绩，并且在技术上得到迅速提高。该部去年七月首先在东北以全力抢修东北各铁道线路，计有清抚（清原至元帅林）、吉长（兴龙山至饮马河），北宁（锦州至山海关）、新义（新立屯至沙拉）锦古（锦州至义县），高新（高台山至新立屯）、新义（西阜新到义县）、哈长（长春至第二松花江）、四长（四平至长春）、大郑（新立屯到泡子）等线。合计修复路线五百三十五公里七百九十六公尺，包括线路、桥梁、给水、号志通信及部分建筑等工程。接着在平津战役开始时，为护运大量部队入关，第一、第四两支队又积极抢修北宁线铁路：一支队于去年十二月，六天修复线路三十五公里三百六十公尺，道岔二十八组并补修了北戴河后封台间的全段，平均每日修复线路七公里七十二公尺。四支队于本年一月一日动工抢修后封台至滦河段，修复路线二十八公里一百三十公尺，平均每日修四公里六十八公尺。抢修津浦线北段陈官屯至桑梓店间线路，该线合计二百九十七公里、一百三十九公尺，道岔七十六组，先后于三月二十五日竣工。与以上线路修复同时，又展开了抢修桥梁的伟大工程。九个月来，共修复了桥梁一三九座，计有哈长线、长图线、高新线、沈吉线，锦古线、北宁线等被破坏桥梁一○五座，四百六十孔；涵洞三个，桥台六十七个，桥墩二百六十一座。今年二月十八日，临时性和永久性桥梁已全部修复。华北方面：自东北野战军十二月入关后，一、四支队即先修通山海关到滦县段，后又修通金溪河段线路，随即着手准备修复津浦、陇海、平汉、北宁等线的桥梁，以上共被破坏大小桥八十一座，二百一十五孔，涵洞二百零九个。根据四月七日以前材料，修复永久性及临时性桥梁三十四座，八十九孔，涵洞一百六十处，尚有四十四座桥正在修复中。在抢修津浦路工程中，四支队担负两段工程：第一段由陈官屯到沧县，第二段由沧县到东光，这两段分别于二月四日及三月四日先后开工，到二月二十七及三月十七日先后完工，比原计划每公里四百个工节省了七十个工，超过了计划。但在整个工作中尚存在着若干缺点，如个别地区因技术不熟练，及道钉、枕木都是本地出品、道钉软、枕木硬，因此有的道钉只打进枕木四五毫米就开了，有的钉头打偏了，甚至有些枕木因钉入道钉而裂开。为了克服以上的毛病，他们与加强学习技术和政治同时，正在紧张的突击修复淮河大桥及驻马店等桥梁的工程。铁道兵团实际上起着人民铁道修复建设中的主力军的伟大作用。成为中国人民解放军中的一支强大的优秀的技术兵种。
