　　The Agricultural Department of the North China People's Government
　　Organizes Insect Extermination Work Team to An Yang to Treat Locust Nymphs
　　[Taihang News] An Yang County has recently experienced a second outbreak of locust nymphs (the first was in mid-February) covering a very wide area. The Eighth District, Fourth District, Third District, First District, and other areas have almost universally experienced the outbreak. The highest density is 200 per square step. The county government immediately organized a locust extermination work team of 27 people, divided into three teams, to go to the villages to organize the masses to exterminate the locusts. This outbreak of locusts mainly occurred on hillsides, wasteland, field edges, and past marginal areas. Ten out of the county's eleven districts are suffering from the locust plague, and active efforts are being made to eliminate it. (Wang Ruqi)
　　[Another News] An Yang is a place where locusts occur every year. A slight neglect of prevention and treatment may lead to a huge disaster. It is necessary to organize the masses to thoroughly eradicate them. The Agricultural Department of the North China People's Government attaches great importance to the locust plague in the area. It has specially appointed Mr. Ye Hecai, Lu Baolin, Huang Kexun, and teaching assistants and students from Tsinghua University and Peking University, a total of sixteen people, to form the An Yang Insect Extermination Work Team. They set off for An Yang on the 7th of this month to help eliminate the locust nymphs.

　　华北人民政府农业部
  　组除虫工作队赴安阳治蝗蝻
    【太行讯】安阳县近日又发生第二次蝗蝻（第一次是二月中旬）范围极广。八区、四区、三区、一区等地几乎普遍发生。密度最多的每方步有二百个，县府当即组织剿蝗工作队，共二十七人，分三队到乡村组织群众剿蝗。这次蝗虫的发生，主要是山坡、荒地、地边及过去的边缘地带。全县十一区有十个区闹蝗灾，现正积极扑灭中。　　　（王汝琪）
    【又讯】安阳是历年发生蝗虫的地方，稍一疏于除治，即可能蔓延成巨害，必须组织群众彻底根除。华北人民政府农业部极重视该地蝗害，特约定叶和才、陆宝麟、黄可训先生以及清华、北大助教学员等十六人组成了安阳除虫工作队，本月七日已首途前赴安阳，帮助除治蝗蝻。
