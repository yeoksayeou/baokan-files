　　Ping City Cotton Yarn and Cloth Company Supports Nearly 300 Weaving and Dyeing Factories; 3,000 Workers Gain Employment
    [Ping City News] The Cotton Yarn and Cloth Company is vigorously supporting the weaving and dyeing industry in Ping City. In May, it collected 25,414 bolts of locally produced cloth, supported 296 weaving and dyeing factories, and loaned 1,964 bales of cotton yarn to factories with working capital difficulties, providing employment for 3,000 workers and alleviating their worries about unemployment. Their wages can solve the livelihood problems of 10,500 people. The workers' morale is high, and their work efficiency has increased. For example, before liberation, the most productive month for Lifeng Dyeing Factory was only 3,400 bolts of dyed cloth. After liberation, in the first month of operation (April), they dyed 6,300 bolts, and in May, production increased to 8,500 bolts. The factory owners have obtained certain profits and are now expanding their production tools and increasing production significantly.
    The Cotton Yarn and Cloth Company is formulating plans for June, deciding to assist various factories in improving quality, standardizing specifications, establishing trademarks, and packaging to fully standardize the length, width, and weight of various cloths to meet the needs of the people.

　　平市花纱布公司　扶助织染业近三百家　三千工人获得了职业
    【平市讯】花纱布公司大力扶植平市染织工业。五月份共收进了市布条布二五四一四匹，扶助二百九十六家织染工厂，并贷给了无法周转的工厂棉纱一千九百六十四块，使三千名工人有了职业，解除了失业的顾虑；他们所得的工资，能够解决一万零五百人的生活。工人们的情绪很高，增加了工作的效率，如丽丰漂染厂，在未解放前的最旺月，每月只能染布三千四百匹。解放后，开工的头一个月（四月）即染了六千三百匹，五月间即增产到八千五百匹。厂主已得到了一定的利润，现正扩展他们的生产工具，大量增产。
    花纱布公司正定出六月份的计划，决定扶助各工厂提高质量，统一规格，制定商标，加以整装，使各种布匹的长度宽度和重量完全标准化，以符合人民的需用。　　　　　（单学斌）
