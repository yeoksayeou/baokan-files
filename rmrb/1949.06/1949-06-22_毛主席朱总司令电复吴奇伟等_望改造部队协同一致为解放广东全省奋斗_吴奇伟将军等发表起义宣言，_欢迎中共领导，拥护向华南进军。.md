Mao Zedong

Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, June 21st: The headquarters of the People's Liberation Army received a declaration led by General Wu Qiwai, entitled "Our Declaration." General Wu Qiwai once served as the deputy director of the Kuomintang Wuhan Headquarters and Guangzhou Headquarters, the deputy director of the Xuzhou Pacification Headquarters, and the deputy commander-in-chief of the North China "剿匪总司令部" (Bandit Suppression Headquarters). Later, he realized the mistake of the counter-revolutionary civil war, changed his position, and resolved to stand on the side of the People's Liberation Army. In May, patriotic soldiers related to General Wu Qiwai, such as Zeng Tianjie, led an uprising in eastern Guangdong and western Fujian, coordinating with the local People's Liberation Army to occupy a vast area centered on Meixian, dealing a great blow to the Guangdong reactionaries. The declaration they issued on May 14th is as follows:

Our Declaration:

China is unfortunate to have encountered a catastrophe unprecedented in thousands of years. The bandit leader Chiang Kai-shek, in order to preserve the dictatorial rule of his four major families and maintain the exploitation of the people, has not hesitated to collude with American imperialism and attack the people with the most cruel and vicious means. Although they have been utterly defeated and cannot withstand the final blow of the People's Liberation Army, they are still attempting to collect remnants and make a desperate struggle. Chiang Kai-shek's betrayal of the country and harm to the people is extremely hateful. Although we have served under the Kuomintang reactionary government for a considerable period, what is the price we have gained? It only created the bureaucratic regime of Chiang Kai-shek and improved the living enjoyment of the Kuomintang party officials. We unanimously hate the shamelessness of Chiang Kai-shek's bandits. The facts before us, victory and defeat are extremely obvious. Survival and destruction are determined in an instant.

The Chiang Kai-shek clique, which violates the interests of the people, is in a state of exhaustion. The People's Liberation Army, which protects the interests of the people, is giving Chiang Kai-shek and Li Zongren the final blow with a firm iron hammer. For our own survival and transformation, for the rapid end of the war, for the realization of Chairman Mao's eight peace conditions, for the relief of the people's suffering, and for the liberation of the country and the nation, we resolutely launched an uprising in western Fujian and eastern Guangdong, the last base of the reactionary government. We welcome the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party. We support the People's Liberation Army's march into Taiwan and Guangzhou. We firmly implement the New Democracy policy. We are willing to engage in the construction of a New China under the leadership of the coalition government. At the same time, we welcome patriotic soldiers who are still under the rule of the Kuomintang reactionary government to launch uprisings and oppose imperialism and the Kuomintang reactionaries. Finally, we shout:

(1) Down with Chiang Kai-shek, who betrays the country and harms the people! (2) Down with American imperialism! (3) Eradicate corrupt officials, local tyrants, and evil gentry! (4) Implement New Democracy! (5) Support the revolutionary coalition government! (6) Long live the Chinese People's Liberation! (7) Long live the victory of the People's Liberation Army!

Wu Qiwai, Li Jiezhi, Zeng Tianjie, Xiao Wen, Wei Jianxian, Dong Juchu, Wei Hanxin, Zhang Sukui. May 14, 1949

    毛主席朱总司令电复吴奇伟等
    望改造部队协同一致为解放广东全省奋斗
    吴奇伟将军等发表起义宣言，  欢迎中共领导，拥护向华南进军。
    【新华社北平二十一日电】毛主席、朱总司令本日复吴奇伟将军等一电。该电称：吴奇伟、李洁之、曾天洁、萧文、魏鉴贤、董举初、魏汉新、张苏奎诸先生：
    接读诸先生五月十四日宣言，决心脱离国民党反动派，加入人民解放军行列，极为欣慰。希望你们遵守人民解放军制度，改造部队，与人民解放军整个力量协同一致，为解放广东全省而奋斗。同时，告诉广东的一切国民党军，凡愿脱离反动派，加入人民解放军方面者，我们将一律不究既往，表示欢迎。
    毛泽东  朱德  一九四九年六月二十一日
    【新华社北平二十一日电】人民解放军总部收到由吴奇伟将军领衔的宣言一件，题名“我们的宣言”。吴奇伟将军曾任国民党武汉行辕和广州行辕的副主任、徐州绥署副主任及华北“剿总”副总司令，后来觉悟反革命内战的错误，改变立场，决心站在人民解放军方面。五月间，与吴奇伟将军有联系的爱国军人曾天洁等多人在粤东闽西率部起义，配合当地人民解放军，占领以梅县为中心的广大区域，给广东反动派以很大的打击。他们于五月十四日发表的宣言，全文如下：
    我们的宣言：
    中国不幸，遭遇数千年来未有之浩劫，匪首蒋介石，为了保存其四大家族的专制统治和维持对人民的剥削，不惜勾结美帝国主义，以最残忍最狠毒的手段，向人民进攻。虽然他们已经一败涂地，不堪人民解放军最后一击，而仍企图收集残余，做垂死的挣扎。蒋介石之误国殃民，实使人痛恨至极。我们虽在国民党反动政府下服务相当时期，但是所得的代价是什么呢？只是创造了蒋介石辈官僚的政权，提高了国民党党官们的生活享受。我们一致痛恨蒋介石匪徒之无耻。摆在前面的事实，胜利与失败已极明显。生存与灭亡，乃决于转瞬间。
    违背人民利益的蒋介石集团已陷于日暮途穷的境地。爱护人民利益之解放军，正以坚毅的铁锤，向蒋介石、李宗仁予以最后一击。我们为了自身的生存与改造，为了迅速结束战争，为了实现毛主席八大和平条件，为了解除人民痛苦，为了国家民族的解放，故毅然决然于反动政府最后根据地的闽西和岭东，举行起义。我们欢迎中国共产党的领导。我们拥护人民解放军向台湾和广州进军。我们坚决执行新民主主义的政策。我们愿意在联合政府的领导下，从事新中国的建设。同时，我们欢迎还在国民党反动政府统治下的有爱国心的军人，举行起义，反对帝国主义及国民党反动派。最后我们高呼：
    （一）打倒误国害民的蒋介石。（二）打倒美帝国主义。（三）铲除贪官污吏、土豪劣绅。（四）执行新民主主义。（五）拥护革命的联合政府。（六）中国人民解放万岁！（七）人民解放军胜利万岁！
    吴奇伟、李洁之、曾天洁、萧文、魏鉴贤、董举初、魏汉新、张苏奎。一九四九年五月十四日
