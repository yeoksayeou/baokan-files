　　Ping City Primary and Secondary Schools to Begin Summer Vacation on July 1st
    [Ping City News] The Ping City Education Bureau has stipulated that this year's summer vacation for all primary and secondary schools in Ping City will begin on July 1st. It is not allowed to start earlier in order to avoid hindering students' studies. Rural primary schools in teaching districts will have wheat and autumn vacations instead of summer vacations, so that students can help with family production during the busy farming season. The method is to end the curriculum for this semester on July 10th, and change to new books on July 11th to begin the next semester.

　　平市中小学七一放暑假
    【平市讯】平市各中小学本年暑假已经市教育局规定自七月一日开始放假，不得提早，以免妨碍学生课业。凡教区之农村小学，则放麦假与秋假，不放暑假，以便学生在农忙时期帮助家庭生产。其办法为本学期课程在七月十日结束，七月十一日换用新书，开始下一学期。
