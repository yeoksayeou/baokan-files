　　On the Reality of Literature

　　Comrade Xiao Yin:

　　…In my previous letter, I offered the opinion that your work "Quarrel" "reflects only phenomena and lacks reality." You feel this is not accurate, and you still believe that the life reflected in "Quarrel" "is real," your only reason being: "What I wrote is based on the actual situation here, they are all real things, and I saw them with my own eyes."

　　However, describing facts that you "saw with your own eyes" does not equal correctly reflecting reality.

　　The so-called reality, according to the general saying of art studies, refers to "artistic truth." What is artistic truth? Roughly speaking, it means: any work that artistically reflects life, and this reflected life can appropriately reflect objective reality and the laws of reality, is considered by people to be a work with artistic truth.

　　However, what you see are merely superficial phenomena, you have not grasped the essence of the phenomena. Whether a work has reality, that is, whether it has artistic truth, is not determined by whether the phenomenon is real, but by whether the essence of the phenomenon and the laws of reality are artistically expressed. Any work that can artistically expose the essence of the phenomenon and give the reader a positive inspiration can be said to have reality; otherwise, there is no reality to speak of.

　　And your "Quarrel" actually has no reality to speak of. You chose the phenomenon of a People's Liberation Army soldier quarreling with a resident as the subject matter, and only stopped at the description of superficial phenomena, which is already very inappropriate; the worst thing is that you particularly focused on portraying the "unfriendly" attitude, expressions, and language of the soldier towards the resident. In that case, what kind of meaning (theme) will this work imply to the reader? According to the plot and characters expressed in your work itself, the meaning is very obvious, namely: the People's Liberation Army is also unreasonable. May I ask, does such a conclusion (theme ideology) have the slightest thing in common with reality?

　　Will the phenomenon of individual People's Liberation Army soldiers quarreling with residents occur? I think it will happen, but from the perspective of the entire People's Liberation Army, it is only a special phenomenon, and it can never represent the style of the People's Liberation Army. You may ask: "Can't this special phenomenon be written about?" I think it can be written about (if you are happy to write about it), but you cannot be satisfied with these superficial phenomena, you must explore the root causes and results of this phenomenon. As long as you dig deeper, you will know that the essence of the problem is not as simple as the superficial phenomenon: perhaps it is a former enemy soldier who was liberated not long ago, who still retains the remnant style of warlordism due to the short education time; perhaps it is a class alien who pretends to be a People's Liberation Army to undermine the relationship between the army and the people; perhaps it is because both parties have backward consciousness… etc. In short, these are not the essence of the People's Liberation Army.

　　The People's Liberation Army is the army of the people, and all its policies, actions, and even work style and attitude towards others are based on the long-term interests of the people… This is the most essential quality of the People's Liberation Army. All phenomena that deviate from this essential quality are special. All special phenomena and false appearances "reproduced" in literature and art have no reality to speak of, and similarly, no artistic truth to speak of. This approach will only lead the work into the quagmire of "distorting reality" and "obliterating truth."

　　I tell you once again: facts are not necessarily all true. Although there is truth in facts, facts are not equal to truth. Truth can only be discovered after facts (or phenomena) have been analyzed, criticized, and their essence grasped. Otherwise, if you simply "copy" the scattered and mixed phenomena experienced by the senses, it is nothing more than an accumulation of phenomena. For example, writing about the scene of a production competition in a factory, if you do not delve into the more essential things, no matter how you describe it, the result will be at most to write the competition scene "vividly," and in addition, what useful enlightenment can it give the reader? A superficial work like this, you say it distorts reality, it doesn't; you say it reflects reality, it doesn't. In that case, what is the meaning of this type of work? Unfortunately, there are still people writing like this now, and they are still being blindly praised. We believe that merely describing phenomena is meaningless. Blindly "reproducing" life is an expression of objectivism in literary writing, which can no longer meet the needs of the people now; mechanically listing life phenomena is an expression of trivial empiricism in writing, which is even more undesirable. Please recall: all classical works that have played a positive role are not an accumulation of phenomena, they always explain the truth hidden behind life through flesh-and-blood life (life phenomena). Take "The True Story of Ah Q" as an example. On the surface, it seems to be writing a story about a funny character. In fact, Mr. Lu Xun used this character and event to reveal the social essence hidden behind the tragedy of this character.

　　Emphasizing the exposure of the essence of social phenomena, emphasizing the explanation of the causal relationship of things (or the laws of reality) is one of the characteristics of the realistic creation method. Because only in this way will the work have a high degree of ideology.

　　Of course, to recognize and express the essence of reality and the laws of reality, one cannot be like social science: after extracting a few principles from various phenomena, the flesh-and-blood life is thrown aside. The method of artistic recognition and expression should be that thought and flesh-and-blood life are carried out together. The so-called essence of reality or laws of reality should not be analyzed and then added to the work, but should be integrated into flesh-and-blood life. Only in this way will the theme ideology not be "preaching," will it have artistic persuasiveness, and will it be possible to have artistic truth; only in this way can the reader naturally accept the theme ideology in artistic feeling and further understand reality.

　　The above opinions are very superficial and may still have errors, only for your reference…

### 关于文学的现实性

专栏：

　　关于文学的现实性
    萧殷××同志：
    ……我在前信中对你的作品所提出的意见：“‘吵架’中所反映的尽是现象，缺乏现实性。”你认为不中肯，你仍然认为“吵架”中所反映的生活“是现实的”，你的唯一的理由是：“我所写的都是根据这里的实际情况，都是实在的事情，而且都是我亲眼看见的。”
    但是，描写了“亲眼看见”的事实，不等于正确的反映了现实。
    所谓现实，按照艺术学的普通说法，是指“艺术的真实”而言。什么是艺术的真实呢？大概意思是：凡艺术地反映了生活，而这被反映的生活又能恰当地反映了客观现实和现实法则的作品，人们就称它是具有艺术的真实性的作品。
    但是，你所看见的仅仅是一些表面的现象，你还没有把握住现象的本质。作品是否有现实性，即是否具有艺术的真实性，不是由现象实在与否来决定，而是由现象本质与现实法则是否得到艺术的表现来决定，凡能艺术地将现象的本质暴露出来，而又能给读者一种积极的启示的作品，都可以说有现实性，否则就谈不上什么现实性。
    而你这篇“吵架”，实际上已没有现实性可言。你选择一个解放军的战士与一个居民吵架的现象当作题材，而且仅仅停留在表面现象的描写上，已经很不妥当；最糟糕的，是你特别着力刻划了战士对居民“不友好”的态度，表情与语言上。既然这样，那末这篇作品将给读者暗示一种什么意思（主题）呢？根据你作品本身所表现出来的情节与人物来看，意思是很明显的，即：解放军也是不讲理的。试问这样的结论（主题思想）与现实有丝毫共同之点么？
    个别解放军战士与居民吵架的现象是否会发生呢？我想是会发生的，但从整个人民解放军来说，那仅仅是一种特殊的现象，绝不能代表人民解放军的作风。你也许会问：“这种特殊现象难道就不能写吗？”我以为可以写的（如果你高兴写的话），不过，不能满足这点点表面现象，必须探求这现象发生的根本原因及其结果。只要你深入挖掘下去，你就知道问题的本质不象表面现象那样单纯：也许那是一个才解放不久的敌军士兵，因受教育时间不长，还保留着军阀主义的残余作风；也许那是一个阶级异己分子，冒充解放军来破坏军民关系；也许因为双方都意识落后……等等。总之，这都不是人民解放军的本质。
    人民解放军是人民的子弟兵，他的一切政策、行动，甚至工作作风与待人接物的态度等等，都是以人民的长远利益为出发点的，……这就是人民解放军最本质的品质。凡是与这本质品质游离的现象，都是特殊的。在文学艺术上所“再现”的一切特殊现象与假象，都谈不上现实性，同样谈不上艺术的真实性。这种做法，只会使作品陷入“歪曲现实”“抹煞真理”的泥坑。
    我再一次告诉你：事实不一定都是真实的，在事实里面虽然含有真理，但事实不等于真理。事实（或现象）只有经过分析、批判，并把握了其本质之后，真理才会被发见的。否则，如果你把感官所经验的散乱、混杂的现象，原原本本地“复写”一次，也不过是现象的堆积而已。比如写工厂里的生产竞赛的场面吧，如果你不深入挖掘出更本质的东西，任你怎样描写，结果，顶多把这竞赛情景写得“毕真传神”，此外，还能给读者什么有益的启示呢？象这样表面化的作品，你说它歪曲了现实吧，没有，说它反映了现实吧，也没有。既然这样，那末这类作品到底有什么意义？可惜的，现在仍然有人这样写着，而且还被人盲目赞扬着。我们认为：仅仅描写现象是无意义的。盲目地“再现”生活，是客观主义在文学写作上的表现，它已不能满足现在人民的需要；机械地罗列生活现象，是琐碎的经验主义在写作上的表现，更加要不得。请回想一下：凡是起过积极作用的古典作品，都不是现象的堆积，它总是通过有血有肉的生活（生活现象）来说明隐藏在生活背后的真实。就拿“阿Ｑ正传”来说吧，从表面看，好象是写一个滑稽人物的故事，实际上，是鲁迅先生借这人物与事件来揭露隐藏在这人物悲剧背后的社会本质。
    强调暴露社会现象的本质，强调说明事物的因果关系（或现实法则），是现实主义创作方法的特点之一。因为只有如此，作品才会有高度的思想性。
    当然，要认识和表现现实本质与现实法则，不能象社会科学那样：从各种现象中抽出几条原则之后，就把血肉生活抛到一边了，艺术的认识与表现方法，应该是思想与血肉生活一同进行。所谓现实本质或现实法则，不是分析出来之后附加到作品上去，而应该融和在血肉生活里。只有这样，主题思想才不会是“说教”，才有艺术的说服力，才可能具有艺术的真实性；只有这样，读者才能在艺术的感受中自自然然的接受主题思想，深一步的认识现实。
    以上意见很肤浅，也许还有错误，只供你参考……
