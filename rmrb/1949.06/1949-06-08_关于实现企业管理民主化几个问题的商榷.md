　　Discussion on Several Issues Concerning the Implementation of Democratic Enterprise Management
　　Our Reporter Tian Liu
　　Starting from the 20th of last month, all state-owned and public factories in Beiping Municipality launched a propaganda campaign for the democratization of enterprise management. Over the past half-month, there have been achievements. The class consciousness of the workers has been raised a step further, and they have further recognized that "all employees are the masters of the factory. To run their own factory well, they must establish a factory management committee." Some instances of discord between the administrative and trade union sides in individual factories have begun to attract attention. Military representatives and managers in enterprises such as the 70th Ordnance Factory and the Highway Bureau have made self-criticisms of their past shortcomings in administrative leadership, such as not following the mass line and not paying enough attention to the immediate concerns of the workers. The workers were very happy after hearing this, and they said: "Only the Communist Party can do this." As a result, the workers' sense of ownership has been enhanced, which not only strengthens the relationship between political work and administration but also serves as an effective promotion of the democratization of enterprise management and a practical mobilization of all employees.
　　However, there are still some factories and a significant number of employees who are indifferent and uninterested in this issue, which is crucial to the success of the factory enterprises and directly related to the vital interests of the employees and the people.
　　What are the reasons? According to the reporter's understanding of several major public enterprises in Beiping, the following factors hinder the progress and development of the democratic enterprise management movement.
　　First, the administrative leadership of the enterprises lacks a clear reliance on proletarian ideology and has not actively mobilized and led the workers to participate in this work. They only say in words: "The factory management committee is very important and must be established," but they excuse themselves by saying, "I am busy with work, let the trade union take care of all the propaganda and organizational work!" Under the control of this idea, they adopted a liberal or even bureaucratic attitude towards the workers' demands, opinions, and suggestions. The handling of some issues by the 409 Automobile Repair Factory and the 8th Machinery Repair Shop reflects this phenomenon. The 409 factory has an empty house, and the workers requested to move in. The administration neither explained that the house could not be used as a worker's dormitory for some reason nor allowed the workers to move in, always dragging on. Some time ago, when the factory adjusted the unreasonable wages left by the enemy, the administration did not mobilize the workers to discuss and listen to the opinions of the masses, but instead asked a few old employees who did not understand the wage policy of our people's government and lacked contact with the workers to "set it up." Currently, gasoline is very scarce, and the workers try their best to save it when repairing cars, but administrative cadres take cars to see operas. Administrative cadres rarely go among the workers to listen to the opinions of the masses and rarely go to the workshops to understand the production situation. Some administrative leaders of the 8th Machinery Repair Shop ignored the workers' suggestions even more seriously. The workers saw that there were too many non-production personnel in the factory and enthusiastically suggested to the factory to reduce non-production personnel and streamline the organization to facilitate production, but the administrative leaders of the shop said to the workers: "Do your work, get your salary at the end of the month, why do you care about these idle things?!" A few days ago, some houses in the factory were to be distributed to the workers. Instead of organizing the workers to discuss and distribute them reasonably, they used a lottery method, whoever drew it would occupy it. Other factories also have such things: for example, trusting workers from the old liberated areas and not trusting workers from Beiping, trusting the work team sent by the All-China Federation of Trade Unions and not trusting the trade union elected by the factory's own employees, committing the extremely wrong closed-doorism, forming disunity between the new and old liberated areas workers, between the trade union and the work team, and between the trade union and the administration, because the administrative leaders of some factories lacked reliance on proletarian ideology, were not good at listening to and accepting the opinions of workers in their work, did not organize and mobilize workers, and even learned the bad habits of bureaucracy, which formed obstacles to the democratization of factory management and the mobilization of workers to actively participate in enterprise management. Some workers have said: "Just saying we are the masters, but we don't have the authority, how can we be the masters?"
　　Secondly, there are still shortcomings and imperfections in the work of the trade union itself, which also affect the effective development of the democratic enterprise management movement. During the discussion of the conditions for worker representatives to participate in the factory management committee, several factories wanted to elect "those who dare to speak." After further understanding with the worker comrades, we learned that "those who dare to speak" were originally "those who dare to oppose and fight against the administration." This is not surprising. The history of the workers is the history of being slaves and oppressed. Today, the worker comrades have changed from slaves to masters. This change has come so drastically and suddenly that many workers have not yet consciously recognized this change. Therefore, when initially mobilizing workers to establish trade unions, it was inevitable that their demands would be limited to the scope of welfare and wages. At that time, the enthusiasm of the employees was generally high, believing that their party—the Communist Party of China—had arrived, and that the establishment of trade unions could immediately increase wages and make welfare as great as imagined. But things cannot be done well in one morning. It is precisely because the Communist Party cares about the interests of the workers that it must unite current interests with long-term interests, lead the workers and all the people to overthrow the enemy, run the factory well, and improve the lives of the workers in the development of production. The trade union is based on this basic principle to solve and handle the problems of the workers. Many workers quickly recognized this truth and treated their factories and their work with the attitude and identity of masters, with a brand-new work attitude, but there are also many workers who have not yet recognized this point, so they are disappointed with the trade union, and this mood also affects the work of the factory management committee currently underway. This cannot be blamed on the workers, this is exactly the work we have to do. Moreover, since the liberation of Beiping, the Party and the trade union have been continuously conducting education for five months, which has achieved very good results. It is believed that the workers' movement in Beiping Municipality will become broader, more enthusiastic, and more in-depth, as long as we are good at leading and conducting in-depth propaganda.
　　This is a general overview of the democratic enterprise management of public factories in Beiping Municipality and the existing obstacles and difficulties. The reporter believes that the following issues should be noted in the ongoing work on the democratization of factory management.
　　First of all, we must use the weapon of criticism and self-criticism to launch a propaganda campaign for the democratization of enterprise management, and avoid the empty and unrealistic formalistic propaganda of "reading drafts" and "reciting outlines" that once occurred in propaganda work. The democratization of factory management itself is a struggle, especially a struggle against bureaucratic ideology and work style. We should carry out in-depth and effective propaganda education to all employees—including the main administrative cadres—and mobilize and lead all employees to launch a mass movement against bureaucratic ideology and work style.
　　Secondly, on the basis of criticism and self-criticism, we should resolve all the improperly handled legacy issues that existed in the past and can be resolved, and immediately strengthen the daily democratic life of employees. All major issues related to employees in the factory must listen to and solicit the opinions of employees. With the development of criticism and self-criticism propaganda work, we should launch an employee solidarity movement. The North China Highway Bureau has already made a good start in this regard, and all public factories should learn from them.
　　Finally, regarding the timing and conditions for establishing the factory management committee, there are two phenomena that are worth noting. One is to rush to establish the management committee without sufficient propaganda, deliberation, and preparation, resulting in formality. The other is to always think that the workers are "backward" and hesitate to establish it. It is certainly not good to rush, but it is also wrong to keep dragging on without letting go, because the establishment of the factory management committee and the work it carries out is itself a most practical education, and the democratization of factory management is gradually perfected and improved in practice.

　　关于实现企业管理民主化几个问题的商榷
    本报记者  田流
    从上月二十号开始，北平市所有的国营、公营工厂展开了一个企业管理民主化的宣传运动，半月来是有成绩的。职工的阶级觉悟提高了一步，进一步认识了“全体职工是工厂的主人，要把自己的工厂搞好，就要成立工厂管理委员会”个别工厂某些行政工会不协调的地方，开始引起双方注意。七十兵工厂、公路总局等企业的军事代表经理等都对过去行政领导上的不走群众路线、关心职工切身问题不够等缺点作了自我批评，工人们听后都很高兴，他们说：“只有共产党才能这样作”，因而提高了职工们主人翁的自觉，不但使政工关系进一步密切起来，也是对企业管理民主化一个有效的宣传，对全体职工一个实际的动员。
    但是还有一些工厂，还有不算少的一部分职工，对这一左右工厂企业办得好坏的关键问题，也是对职工及人民切身利益有直接关系的问题，表示冷淡和不感兴趣。
    什么原因呢？根据记者对平市几个主要公营企业的了解，有下面的几个因素，妨碍着企业管理民主化运动的进行和展开。
    首先是企业行政领导方面缺乏明确的依靠无产阶级思想，没有积极的发动和领导工人参加这一工作，只在口头上说：“工厂管理委员会很重要，非成立不可”，但他却借口“我工作忙，一切宣传和组织工作，你们工会作去吧！”在这种思想支配下，他们，对工人的要求、意见、建议采取了自由主义甚至官僚主义的态度。四○九汽车修理厂和第八修械所对于一些问题的处理，就反映了这种现象。四○九厂有一部空房子，工人要求搬去住，行政上既不说明这房子因某种原因不能作为工人宿舍，也不允许工人去住，总在那里拖时间；该厂前些日子调整敌人遗留下的不合理工资时，行政上不是发动工人讨论，听取群众意见，却叫那不了解我人民政府之工资政策而又和工人缺乏联系的几个旧职员在那里“订了订”；目前汽油很缺，修理汽车时工人都极力注意节约，行政干部却坐上汽车去看戏，行政干部很少见到工人中间去倾听群众意见的，很少到工作间去了解生产情形。第八修械所某些行政负责干部，忽视工人建议就更严重了，工人看到厂内非生产人员过多，热心的关切的向工厂建议减少非生产人员，精简机构，以利发展生产，但该所行政负责干部却对工人说：“你作你的工吧，到月拿工资，你管这些闲事干嘛？！”前几天，该厂有些房子要分给工人住，他不去组织工人讨论，合情合理的分配，却是用拈阄办法，谁拈住了谁去占。其他的厂还有这样的事情：譬如信任老区来的工人，不相信北平的工人，信任总工会派来的工作组，不信任本厂职工自己选举成立起来的工会，犯了极端错误的关门主义，形成新老区工人、工会与工作组、工会与行政不团结，就是因为某些工厂的行政领导干部缺乏依靠无产阶级思想，在工作中不善于倾听和接受工人意见，不组织和发动工人，甚至学了官僚主义的恶习，就形成了阻碍工厂管理民主化，发动工人积极参加企业管理，有的工人就这样说过：“光说当主人，当家不作主，怎么当主人？”
    其次，在工会工作本身还有缺点和不健全的地方，也影响了企业管理民主化运动的有效展开。这次工人同志们在讨论参加工厂管理委员会之工人代表条件时，有好几个厂是要选“敢说话的”，同工人同志们进一步了解中，才知道这“敢说话的”原来是“敢和行政上闹对立作斗争的人”。这是难怪的，工人的历史就是作奴隶被压迫的历史，而今天，工人同志们由奴隶变成了主人。这个变化来得如此剧烈而突然，以致许多工人还来不及自觉的认识这种变化。于是在最初发动工人成立工会时，就不可免的把自己的要求局限于福利、工资等范围之内。当时，职工情绪普遍高涨热烈，认为自己的党——中国共产党来了，成立起工会来，工资可以马上提高，福利可以如想象的那么大。但事情不是一个早晨就都能作好的，正因为共产党关心工人的利益，所以要把当前利益和长远利益统一起来，要领导工人和全体人民把敌人打倒，把工厂办好，在发展生产中来改善工人生活。工会就是根据这一基本原则，来解决和处理工人的问题的。有许多工人很快的认识了这个道理，以主人翁的姿态和身份，以崭新的劳动态度，对待自己的工厂自己的工作了，但也有不少工人，对这点还未认清，因而对工会表示失望，这种情绪也影响到目前正在进行的工厂管理委员会的工作。这是不能责备工人的，这正是我们要作的工作。而且北平解放迄今，五个月来党与工会不断进行教育，已经得到很好的效果。相信北平市的工人运动就要更加宽广热烈深入的开展起来的，只要我们善于领导和深入的宣传。
    这就是北平市各公营工厂进行企业管理民主化的概略情形和存在的障碍与困难，记者认为正在进行的关于工厂管理民主化的工作中，应注意下面几个问题。
    首先要运用批评与自我批评的武器，展开企业管理民主化的宣传运动，避免曾经发生的宣传工作中的“读草案”“念大纲”的空泛的不切实际的形式主义宣传，工厂管理民主化的本身就是一个斗争，特别是向官僚主义的思想作风作斗争，应向全体职工——连行政的主要干部在内作深入有效的宣传教育，发动和领导全体职工展开反官僚主义思想作风的群众运动。
    其次，在批评与自我批评的基础上，解决过去存在的处理不当的而又能解决的一切遗留问题，并立即加强职工的日常民主生活，工厂内一切和职工有关的重大问题，必须倾听和征求职工的意见。并随着批评与自我批评宣传工作的展开，来一个职工团结运动，华北公路总局在这方面已有了很好的开端，各公营工厂应向他们学习。
    最后，关于建立工厂管委会的时机和条件问题，现在有这么两种现象值得注意，一个是不经过充分的宣传酝酿准备工作，就匆忙的把管委会建立起来，结果成了形式。另一个是总认为工人“落后”，迟迟的不敢建立。匆匆忙忙的着急固然不好，总在拖着不敢放手也不对，因为工厂管理委员会的建立和进行工作的本身就是一种最切实的教育，工厂管理民主化是在实践中逐渐完备和健全起来的。
