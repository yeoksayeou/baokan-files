The Shanghai working class held an unprecedented grand and enthusiastic rally to commemorate the "May Thirtieth" anniversary. The Shanghai Federation of Trade Unions Preparatory Committee was also simultaneously announced. Mayor Chen Yi, Deputy Mayor Zeng Shan, CPC Shanghai Municipal Committee Secretary Rao Shushi, Garrison Commander Song Shilun, and others all attended the meeting. This is an unprecedented grand event for the people of Shanghai in more than twenty years. The venue was located in the Grand Theater. A row of red flags from various delegations fluttered in the wind in front of the door. Inside the venue, red covered everything: red flags, red curtains, a red rostrum, and red flowers on the red tables, all symbolizing the victory and brightness of the working class. More than 2,200 worker representatives from various industries in Shanghai, representing more than one million workers, entered the venue in formation, with the workers' military band playing the song "Follow the Communist Party." When Chen Yi, Rao Shushi, Zeng Shan, Song Shilun, and others appeared at the entrance of the venue, the venue was submerged in cheers and applause for several minutes. The conference approved Liu Changsheng, Gu Rufang, Zhu Junxin, Tang Guifen, and 13 others to form the presidium. Chairman Liu Changsheng reported on the significance of commemorating "May Thirtieth" and celebrating the liberation of Shanghai, followed by speeches by Chen Yi, Rao Shushi, and others. Subsequently, the Shanghai Workers' Association and the Professional Circles Association presented two banners to the People's Liberation Army, one reading "Savior of the People" and the other reading "The army advances, production increases by an inch." Chen Yi and Rao Shushi accepted the banners on behalf of the People's Liberation Army. In addition, speakers at the meeting included Gu Rufang, the uncle of Gu Zhenghong, a worker leader who was brutally murdered on the eve of the "May Thirtieth" Movement, Tang Guifen, a member of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions Executive Committee, Zhu Junxin, and Zhang Jiayuan, a representative of railway workers from Nanjing who drove the "Shanghai Liberation" locomotive to Shanghai on the day of "May Thirtieth". They represented workers from all walks of life in thanking the Chinese Communist Party and the People's Liberation Army for their help, and called on workers to increase production and strive for the liberation of all of China and the construction of a new China. The meeting passed a telegram of respect to Chairman Mao, Commander-in-Chief Zhu, and the Third Field Army of the People's Liberation Army, the liberators of Shanghai, and approved the list of 141 members of the Shanghai Federation of Trade Unions Preparatory Committee. The conference lasted for three hours before closing.
