　　Xinhua News Agency, Qiongya, 12th: The Qiongya People's Liberation Army advanced on Jiusuo City, 100 li west of Yaxian County, on June 1st. After three days of fighting, most of the defending enemy was annihilated, with only a few breaking through and fleeing. When our army besieged Jiusuo City, a unit of the enemy's puppet Qiongya Fortress Garrison Headquarters, totaling over 100 men, came to reinforce them from Yaxian County. This enemy fled to Meidong, east of Jiusuo, where they were intercepted by our army. After a brief battle, the bandit army was defeated and fled back to Yaxian City in a panic. Our army annihilated and captured a part of them. In the above two battles, our army annihilated a total of 268 enemies, including 42 killed, including the 2nd Company Commander of the puppet Fortress Garrison Headquarters, Li Daoliang, and 226 captured, including the Deputy Company Commander of the 1st Company of the Fortress Garrison Headquarters, Mo Guixing, the Captain of the Ledong Self-Defense Corps, Lin Qidong, and the Captain of the 1st Company of the Yaxian Self-Defense Corps, He Gaochang. We seized one 82mm mortar, one 60mm gun, nine grenade launchers, twenty-one light machine guns, three submachine guns, one hundred and eighty-three long and short guns, and a portion of other military supplies.
