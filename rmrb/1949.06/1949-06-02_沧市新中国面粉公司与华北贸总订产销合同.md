　　【Jizhong Electric】The North China Trade Corporation (hereinafter referred to as "Trade Corporation"), in order to support the development of state-owned industries and achieve the unity of "production" and "sales," signed a flour production and sales contract with the Cang City State-owned New China Flour Company in March. The contract stipulates that the Trade Corporation is responsible for the supply and marketing of raw materials and finished flour, while the flour company is specifically responsible for production. Raw materials are exchanged for finished products, with every 100 jin of wheat exchanged for 75 jin of flour equivalent to the quality of Tongfen produced by the Dongya Flour Mill. Other expenses such as flour bags and transportation are entirely the responsibility of the Trade Corporation.

　　After the unification of production and sales, the scientific division of labor between trade and factories is further clarified. The flour company can free up management cadres to engage in research on production management and improve products. The Trade Corporation's exchange of raw materials for finished products reduces competition in the market and plays a significant role in stabilizing prices.

    产销统一后，贸易与工厂的科学分工，进一步明确，面粉公司可以腾出经营干部，从事研究生产管理与提高产品，贸总拿原料换成品，减少了市场上多头争购，对稳定物价，作用是很大的。
