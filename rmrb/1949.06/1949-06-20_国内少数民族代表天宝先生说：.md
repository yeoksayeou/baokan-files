Mr. Tian Bao, a representative of national minorities in China, said:
    We have Chairman Mao's path, and we will surely be liberated. He said: The Preparatory Committee of the New Political Consultative Conference has opened, and we will soon be completely liberated. This conclusion of his is entirely derived from his own personal experience.
    Tian Bao is a Tibetan (Fan) person, originally named Sangji Yexi, from Dangba, Xikang. All three of his brothers became lamas. In 1935, the Red Army arrived in Dangba and assisted the local Tibetans in establishing the Boba Federal Government. Tian Bao initially joined the Young Pioneers, and later participated in the work of the Federal Government. When the Red Army continued north from Dangba to resist Japan, the local Red Guards and Young Pioneers jointly formed the Boba Independent Division, which went north with the Red Army, and Tian Bao served as the division's political commissar. He eventually arrived in the democratic holy land—Yan'an.
    In Yan'an, he entered the Nationalities Institute. The participants in the Nationalities Institute were all national minorities from within China. This institute developed the languages and writing systems of various ethnic groups, allowing them to understand the history of their own ethnic groups. He said: The Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region cultivated many cadres and organizations from national minorities. This is completely opposite to the Kuomintang's Han chauvinism. Han chauvinists do not treat national minorities as human beings. There are also some scum among the national minorities who follow the Kuomintang, oppressing and enslaving their own people. He said: The old Political Consultative Conference was dominated by the Kuomintang, and it was impossible for there to be a representative of a national minority. This time, we national minorities have five or six representatives participating in the Preparatory Committee of the New Political Consultative Conference, which is extremely gratifying. He said: Most of the areas inhabited by national minorities have not yet been liberated. Some Hui traitors and Tibetan traitors are still secretly living under the direction of the Kuomintang remnants. However, we believe that with Chairman Mao's path, we will surely be liberated, and it will be liberated soon.

### 国内少数民族代表天宝先生说：

　　国内少数民族代表天宝先生说：
    我们有毛主席的道路，一定会解放的。他说：新政协筹备会开幕了，我们不久就会彻底解放。他这种论断，完全是从自己的切身经历中引伸出来的。
    天宝是藏（番）族人，原名桑吉悦希，西康党坝人。他弟兄三个，全当了喇嘛。一九三五年红军到了党坝，协助当地藏胞成立驳巴联邦政府。天宝最初参加少先队，后来参加联邦政府工作。红军从党坝继续北上抗日，当地赤卫军和少先队联合组成驳巴独立师，随红军北上，天宝任师政委。最后到了民主圣地——延安。
    在延安，他进了民族学院。民族学院的参加者都是国内少数民族，这个学院发展各民族的语言文字，让他们懂得自己民族的历史。他说：陕甘宁边区培养了多少少数民族的干部和团体，这是和国民党那种大汉族主义完全相反的。大汉族主义者不把少数民族当人看，少数民族中也有若干败类跟着国民党跑，欺压奴役自己人。他说：旧政协以国民党为主体，里面不可能有一个少数民族代表。这次，我们少数民族有五、六个代表参加新政协筹备会，这是顶使人高兴的。他说：少数民族的地区，大部分还没有解放，有些回奸、藏奸还在国民党残余的指使下偷偷活着，但是，我们相信，有毛主席的道路，我们一定能解放，而且很快会解放的。
