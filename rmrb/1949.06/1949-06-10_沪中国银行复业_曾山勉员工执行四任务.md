Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, June 9th: The head office of the China Bank and its Shanghai branch, after being taken over by the Military Control Commission, officially resumed business on the 5th. On the afternoon of the 5th, the bank held a general meeting of all employees to resume business. Zeng Shan, Deputy Mayor of Shanghai and Manager of the East China District Branch of the People's Bank of China, attended and delivered a speech. He announced the revocation of the powers of the original board of directors of the bank, and that the East China Military Region would designate the East China Finance and Economic Office to act on behalf of the board of directors. He also announced the new General Manager and Deputy General Manager of the bank's head office, and the new Manager and Deputy Manager of the Shanghai branch. In his speech, Deputy Mayor Zeng first stated: "Today is a new day for the China Bank. From today onwards, it belongs to the people. The Kuomintang and the four major families of Chiang, Soong, Kung, and Chen can never control it again." He continued: "The China Bank and the experts and employees working within the China Bank now have opportunities for development. The old personnel relationships of the past, where 'those who are inferior but close are heavily used, and those who are superior but distant are not promoted,' will also be fundamentally changed from today onwards. From now on, as long as one sincerely serves the people, one will definitely be valued. Anyone who performs special merits in serving the people will be promoted and take on important positions. At the same time, whoever violates the interests of the people and seeks personal gain under the guise of public service will be punished by the People's Government." Finally, Deputy Mayor Zeng called on all employees to carry out the following four major tasks: (1) Transform the China Bank according to the New Democracy policy, making it a bank that genuinely serves the people. (2) Rapidly develop business and assist production; currently, special emphasis should be placed on the restoration and development of domestic and international remittance business. (3) Dredge idle capital and stabilize people's livelihood; currently, inflation-proof savings should be rapidly established. (4) The China Bank is an integral part of the East China District Branch of the People's Bank of China and is completely under its command and leadership. The China Bank should immediately begin to reorganize its institutions and establish connections with China Bank branches and offices in various regions.
