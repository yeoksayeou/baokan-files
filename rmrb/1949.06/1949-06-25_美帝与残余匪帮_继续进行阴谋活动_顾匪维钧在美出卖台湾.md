According to a Reuters dispatch from New York on the 19th, citing a broadcast by a U.S. radio commentator: Gu Weijun, the bogus "Ambassador to the United States," has suggested to the United States that Taiwan be given to the United States as a permanent naval base in exchange for U.S. aid to the remaining Kuomintang bandit gangs.
