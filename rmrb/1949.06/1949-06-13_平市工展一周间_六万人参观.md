　　Peiping Industrial Exhibition in One Week
  　60,000 Visitors
    [Our Dispatch] The Peiping Industrial Products Exhibition has been open for a week as of yesterday (the 12th), with over 60,000 visitors. During this week, the general feedback from visitors has been: "From here, we see the new China," and "This shows that Peiping is moving towards becoming a production city." A visitor, Sun Ji, excitedly said: "Everywhere shows the vigor of the new Peiping." Some people suggested that the exhibition should be held more often and on a rotating basis. Many visitors also offered suggestions for improvement: for example, regarding the cotton gin and chaff cutter made by the Agricultural Machinery Factory, visiting farmers said: if they could be adapted to use human or animal power, they would certainly sell in large quantities in the countryside. If the weight of the five-tooth cultivator could be reduced to be suitable for donkey traction, it would save raw materials, reduce costs, and be suitable for the situation in the countryside where there are more donkeys than cattle. At the exhibition, more patient and detailed explanations should be provided by additional commentators, and more specific and practical criticisms and suggestions should be solicited.

　　平市工展一周间
  　六万人参观
    【本报讯】北平市工业品展览会至昨（十二）日止，已历时一周，参观者达六万余人。这一周中，一般参观者的反映是：“从这里看到了新中国”，“这里说明了北平正在往生产城市方向走。”参观者孙机兴奋地说：“无一处不表现新北平的朝气。”有人建议这里展览会要多多举办，并进行轮回展览。许多参观者也提了一些改进的意见：譬如农业机械厂所制轧花机，铡草机，参观的农民说：如能改用人力或畜力，在乡村一定能大量销售。五齿中耕机如能将重量减轻，适于用驴子拖拉，既可节省原料，又可减低成本，也适于乡村驴多牛少的情况。在展览会中，还须增加说明员多加耐心的仔细的说明，以及多征求一些具体而实用的批评与建议。
