　　Chapter 5: The New Son-in-Law
　
    Red beans,
    White hearts,
    My mother went to arrange a marriage for me.
    I don't want wealth or glory,
    I want to marry a Eighth Route Army soldier!
    A red horse and a sedan chair,
    Coming to fetch the bride...
  　　　　　　　　　——Folk Song
       　　I
    He Shixiong's family kept a wolf dog. That winter, a dog-beating campaign came to all the villages. For the convenience of the guerrillas' activities, all the dogs, large and small, were killed; only the He family's dog, said to have been bought for so many taels of silver, was not allowed to be beaten. The village cadres dared not offend them, and the wolf dog was left.
    Da Shui and his men surrounded He Shixiong's mansion, and the wolf dog barked fiercely. He Shixiong woke up and put on his clothes, wanting to go out and see what was happening. As soon as he opened the door, He Goupi quietly ran over and said, "It's bad! They're climbing over the walls in several places!" He Shixiong hurriedly grabbed his briefcase, picked up his pistol, and said to his concubine, "I'm leaving. Don't be afraid! I'll send someone to pick you up later." He Goupi took the flashlight, and the two of them ran to the small suite, moved the cabinet, and lifted two large square bricks. Below were layers of steps. They turned on the flashlight and went down. The concubine busily put the bricks and the cabinet back in place and went back to sleep. The two of them went down the steps, opened a small revolving door, and inside was an underground tunnel. Because this area was near the water and marshes, water would be reached if they dug too deep. The tunnel was lined with "jar bricks" on all sides, very solid, and led all the way to outside the village. The father and son waited until dark and crawled out from under the offering table in their family's ancestral hall and ran away.
    Da Shui and his men searched until the sun came out, only finding seven rusty old guns. Shuangxi discussed it with Da Shui and told the guerrillas to take the guns back first. They then arranged for the anti-traitor group in the village to secretly monitor Zhang Jinlong. After that, the two of them went to the district to report to Hei Lao Cai.
    Then came the New Year.
    During the New Year, Hei Lao Cai wore a clean uniform. He and his wife, holding their child, went to Zhang Jinlong's house to visit relatives. Xiao Mei's father-in-law, because Hei Lao Cai was the district chief, felt very honored and treated them very politely.
    After the meal, Hei Lao Cai and Zhang Jinlong chatted idly in the west room. Hei Lao Cai asked about his injury. Zhang Jinlong said, "The injury healed a long time ago, but it left me with a chronic illness. I can't do any work, and life is really difficult!" Hei Lao Cai comforted him, "Jinlong, you don't have to worry about that. Under the Anti-Japanese government, we'll never let your family go hungry." Zhang Jinlong said with a smile, "Brother-in-law, I'm counting on you for everything." Hei Lao Cai said, "Don't be polite. Tell me if you have any difficulties. If you feel bored staying at home and want to go out and do something, that's fine too. Right now, our strength has grown, and the Japanese are no longer afraid of the Kuomintang, only the Communist Party. In the future, defeating the Japanese devils won't be a problem. People like you are quite capable. If you could contribute to the country and make some achievements, it would be a bit of ambition for us Chinese." When Zhang Jinlong was complimented, he felt very comfortable. He said politely, "Alas, what ability do I have? I'm just muddling along!" Hei Lao Cai said with a smile, "There are many capable people, it just depends on whether they take the right path or the wrong path! Some work for the Japanese devils, earning the stinking name of a traitor, and won't have a good end; others bring honor to us Chinese and become national heroes, welcomed by the people wherever they go." Zhang Jinlong's heart leaped. He thought Hei Lao Cai must know about that matter, but he just wasn't saying it. He muttered to himself, responding while stealing glances at Hei Lao Cai's expression. But Hei Lao Cai was talking and laughing, completely nonchalant, and started talking about other things.
    In the afternoon, Hei Lao Cai went to the village office. Zhang Jinlong lay on the bed, thinking about Hei Lao Cai's words. Xiao Mei came in and quietly said to him, "You should tell my brother-in-law about that matter soon. It'll be fine if you tell him, but it'll be a problem if you don't." Zhang Jinlong said, "I have nothing to say." Xiao Mei said, "Do you think people don't know? Can you get away with not saying anything?" Zhang Jinlong thought, she must have told Hei Lao Cai! He got angry, jumped up, and said with furrowed brows and glaring eyes, "It must have been your stinking mouth that told him. Damn it, I'm going to settle the score with you today!" He picked up a broom to beat her. Xiao Mei pointed at him and said with amusement, "Beat me, beat me—you're rolling honey in your mouth, but you're biting your finger! You're really confused! If people didn't know, would they go and arrest He Shixiong? There's no wall that doesn't leak, you can't hide anything from people! Even that opium of yours, Lao Cai mentioned it to me just now. With your kind of intentions and actions, being entangled with a traitor unclearly, you should at least be detained. It's just that people are being lenient with you and haven't settled accounts with you yet, why are you being fierce with me!" Zhang Jinlong rolled his eyes at Xiao Mei, threw the broom on the bed, said "Damn it!" and fell back on the bed.
    Xiao Mei sat on the edge of the bed and said to him affectionately, "Jinlong, you should take advantage of my brother-in-law being here and tell him everything, the roots, the branches, the leaves, everything. I'm a cadre too, I guarantee you'll be fine." Zhang Jinlong pondered and pondered, and didn't say anything for a long time. Later he said, "It's okay to tell, but I won't take out the opium!" Xiao Mei said, "Do as you see fit. If it were me, I'd rather die of poverty and starvation than take something from a traitor. As a Chinese, don't you have any backbone!" After saying that, she turned around and left.

　　第五回　新女婿
　
    红豆豆，
    白心心，
    我妈给我去说亲。
    荣华富贵我不要，
    我要嫁个八路军！
    一匹红马一顶轿，
    娶媳妇儿的过来了……
  　　　　　　　　　——民歌
       　　一
    何世雄家里养着一条狼狗。这年冬天，各村都来了个打狗运动，为了游击队活动方便，把大大小小的狗都打死了；只有何家这条狗，说是多少多少银子买来的，不叫打，村干部不敢惹他们，狼狗就留下了。
    大水他们包围了何家大宅，狼狗凶猛的叫起来。何世雄惊醒了，就披上衣裳，想出去看看；刚拉开房门，何狗皮悄悄跑来说：“不好！几个地方都上房了！”何世雄急忙夹了皮包，提着手枪，对小婆说：“我走了。你别怕！以后派人来接你。”何狗皮拿了手电，两个人跑到小套间里，搬开坐柜，掀起两块大方砖，下面是一层层的台阶，他们就捻亮手电，走下去。小婆忙把砖和坐柜放好，又回去睡觉。他两个走下台阶，拉开一个小小的旋门，里边是地洞。因为这一带靠水淀，挖不多深就有水。地洞里四面都用“缸砖”砌得很牢固，一直通到村外，爷儿俩挨到天黑，就从他家坟堂供桌底下钻出来，跑掉了。
    大水他们直折腾到太阳出来，只搜出七支生了锈的大枪。双喜和大水商量了一下，叫游击队先带着这些枪回去，又布置这村的锄奸小组，暗里监视张金龙；接着，他俩就到区上呈报黑老蔡。
    这就过年了。
    新年里，黑老蔡穿了干干净净的制服，夫妻俩抱着孩子，到张金龙家里走亲戚。小梅的公公因为黑老蔡是区长，觉得很有面子，挺客气的招待他们。
    吃过了饭，黑老蔡和张金龙两个在西屋闲谈。黑老蔡问起他的伤，张金龙说：“伤早好利落了，就是做下了病根子，什么营生也不能干，过日子可真难！”黑老蔡安慰他：“金龙，这个你不用发愁；在抗日政府底下，多会儿也不能让你家里挨饿。”张金龙笑着说：“姊夫，这就全靠着你啦。”黑老蔡说：“你可别客气，有什么困难你就说。要是你觉得呆在家里腻歪，想出去干个什么，也行喽。眼下咱们的力量发展了，日本人已经不怕国民党，就怕共产党，将来打败鬼子不成问题。象你这样的人，挺有能耐，要是给国家出把力，立下些功劳，也算是咱们中国人的一点志气。”张金龙一戴上高帽子，心里怪舒服，嘴上客气的说：“咳，我有什么能耐呀？还不是瞎混！”黑老蔡笑着说：“有能耐的人很多，就看走明路还是走暗路了！有的给鬼子办事，落一个汉奸的臭名，还不得好下场；有的为咱中国人争光露脸，闹个民族英雄，走到哪儿老百姓都是欢迎的。”张金龙听了，心就跳起来。他想黑老蔡一定知道那回事，只是不说出来罢了，暗里很嘀咕；一面应着，一面偷眼看黑老蔡的面色。可是黑老蔡说说笑笑，满不在乎的，又谈起旁的来了。
    下午，黑老蔡到村公所去了。张金龙躺在炕上，想着黑老蔡的话。小梅走进来，悄悄跟他说：“你那事儿快跟我姊夫说了吧；说了百不怎么的，不说倒是个事儿呢。”张金龙说：“我没什么说的。”小梅说：“你当人家不知道哇？不说能过得去？”张金龙想，一定是她给黑老蔡说了！心里很起火，跳起来，又是拧眉毛、瞪眼睛的说：“准是你这臭嘴说出去的。他妈的，今儿非跟你算帐不行！”说着抄起个扫炕笤帚就要打。小梅指着他，好笑的说：“你打你打——往你嘴里卷蜜，你还咬指头！你这个人真糊涂！人家不知道，就去抓何世雄啦？世界上没有不透风的墙，什么都瞒不过人！就连你那烟土，刚才老蔡还跟我提起过呢。按你这样的居心行事，跟一个汉奸拉拉扯扯，不清不白的，顶少也得扣起来。是人家宽大你，还没跟你算帐哩，你跟我厉害什么！”张金龙对小梅翻了个白眼，把笤帚往炕上一丢，说了个“他妈的！”又倒在炕上了。
    小梅可坐在炕沿上，亲热的对他说：“金龙，还是趁我姊夫在，把根儿蒂儿、枝儿叶儿，什么都跟他说了吧。我大小也是个干部，我保证你没事儿。”张金龙盘算来，盘算去，半晌没言语。后来他说：“说也能成，烟土我可不拿出来！”小梅说：“你瞧着办吧。要是我，穷死饿死，也不拿汉奸的东西。一个中国人，还没这点儿骨气！”说完，一扭身就出去了。
