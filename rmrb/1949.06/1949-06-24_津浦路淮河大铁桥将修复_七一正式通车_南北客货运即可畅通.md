    Jinpu Railway's Huai River Grand Iron Bridge, heavily damaged by the fleeing Kuomintang bandit troops, has had most of its repairs completed through the efforts of the Railway Corps' 3rd Detachment and the 27th Line Team. It is planned to officially open to traffic on "July 1st," and north-south passenger and freight transport will be unimpeded. The new bridge is being built 12 meters upstream from the old bridge. The bridge is a wooden pontoon bridge with sixteen 25-meter upper-bearing slab beams, with a total length of 449 meters. In addition to the 3rd Detachment and the 27th Line Team, local administrative authorities, local People's Liberation Army soldiers, and more than 800 people participated in the repair work. Diver Wang Jizhen persisted in the water for five hours and gloriously sacrificed himself. When erecting the eighth and ninth spans, the pile supporting the beam suddenly tilted about one meter, and the steel beam on the bridge-erecting machine almost fell into the water. The driver calmly rescued it and avoided the loss. The Railway Corps has decided to erect a monument to commemorate the gloriously sacrificed Wang Jizhen and provide preferential treatment to his family; at the same time, the heroic driver who rescued it will be commended.

    津浦路淮河大铁桥将修复
    七一正式通车
    南北客货运即可畅通
    【本报讯】津浦线之淮河大铁桥，被国民党匪军临逃时大肆破坏，经铁道兵团第三支队及二十七线路队努力抢修，大部工程已告完成。计划在“七一”正式通车，南北客货运即可畅通。新桥建立在旧桥上游十二公尺处，该桥为十六孔二十五公尺上承板梁的木便桥，全长四百四十九公尺。参加这次抢修工作的除第三支队及二十七线路队外，并有地方行政当局、当地人民解放军与群众八百余人。潜水夫王吉珍在水中坚持五个小时，光荣牺牲。在架第八孔与九孔时，梁脚木桩突然倾斜约一米左右，架桥机上的钢梁几乎掉入水中，司机沉着抢修始免受损失。铁道兵团对光荣牺牲之王吉珍决定立碑纪念，且优恤其家属；同时嘉奖英勇抢修之司机。
