The Inaugural Meeting of the China New Legal Science Research Association

	Discusses Building New Laws
	Provisional Regulations Passed, Preparatory Committee Established

[Special Dispatch from Our Newspaper] The inaugural meeting of the China New Legal Science Research Association was held on June 26th in the conference hall of the North China People's Government. More than ninety initiators attended, almost all except those who had not yet arrived in Beiping (a complete list of initiators is attached). The agenda of the meeting was: (1) Reporting on the significance of the meeting; (2) Reporting and discussing the draft provisional regulations; (3) Electing the preparatory committee. The meeting was chaired by Shen Junru, who also reported on the significance of the meeting. He stated, "The construction of new laws is now very urgent. We have already defeated the reactionary army militarily, but in order to have a consolidated New Democratic state system and peaceful social order, we need to establish our own people's laws." He emphasized, "Building a New Democratic country requires new laws. We must have new perspectives in order to create laws that truly serve the people." Therefore, he called on all those engaged in legal work, especially those who have studied the reactionary Six Codes, to earnestly study Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought's views on society, the state, and law, to earnestly study new legal science, and to criticize old legal science, so as to transform their own thinking and serve the people. He pointed out that the initiation of the New Legal Science Research Association is precisely to provide legal professionals with various opportunities for self-study and research. Chen Shaoyu then reported on the draft provisional regulations of the China New Legal Science Research Association (the full text of the draft regulations is attached). He explained the content and meaning of each article of the draft regulations, especially emphasizing the content and meaning of articles one, two, three, and four. This allowed the attendees to gain a clear common understanding of the naming, nature, and tasks of the China New Legal Science Research Association, as well as the provisions for membership, the necessity of studying Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought's views on society, the state, and law, researching new legal science, criticizing old legal science, and the methods of using research findings to serve the people. The explanations of the various organizations and work of the New Legal Science Research Association, especially the possible establishment of a New Legal Science Research Institute and the handling of reading Q&A sessions and legal correspondence courses, made the attendees feel that there were many opportunities for legal professionals to study and research, which they found very exciting. Immediately, a discussion of the draft provisional regulations was launched. Xu Deheng, Zhou Xinmin, Chen Jinkun, Wang Kunlun, Qian Duansheng, Wang Naitang, Kuai Jinde, Ji Gongquan, He Sijing, Yang Shaoxuan, Jia Qian, Guan Shixiong, Xing Zhixiang, Wu Yuheng, Shi Liang, Xie Daoren, Meng Qingshu, Wang Yuecheng, An Zhicheng, Zhang Dehan, and others spoke one after another, with some speaking two or three times. Many also submitted opinions in writing. Everyone unanimously expressed their agreement to adopt the draft provisional regulations of the China New Legal Science Research Association, on the one hand as a draft to be presented to the inaugural meeting, and on the other hand as a basis for the preparatory committee to carry out its work. The speakers enthusiastically expressed various proposals and opinions on the organization and work of the New Legal Science Research Association. Lin Boqu, in particular, expressed concern about the efforts of the participants in the New Legal Science Research Association to study and research new legal science, so as to help the legislative work, judicial work, and legal education work of the New Democratic regime. Before the closing ceremony, Dong Biwu arrived and delivered a speech, the gist of which was: "The old reactionary laws are incompatible with the new democratic Chinese society. Today, we have announced the abolition of the Kuomintang's Six Codes, but to completely crush the ideological system of the old laws, we must thoroughly criticize them. Only in this way can we completely eliminate their influence. Although we do not have a so-called complete code at present, the liberated areas have many individual regulations, outlines, orders, legal outlines, resolutions, etc., that provide us with research and learning materials." He hoped that everyone would study Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought's views on society, the state, and law, and work together to build a complete system of new laws, with the characteristics of new legal science reflected from theory to articles. At this point, the meeting decided to submit the opinions on the draft regulations to the elected preparatory committee for consideration and revision. Next, the members of the preparatory committee of the New Legal Science Research Association were elected. Wang Zhixiang, Wang Bingnan, Wang Kunlun, Wang Xiaoyi, Wang Feiran, Shi Liang, Zuo Zonglun, Shen Junru, Sha Qianli, Li Kenong, Li Mu'an, Li Da, Li Liuru, Wu Yuheng, Wu Chuanyi, Lin Boqu, Meng Qingshu, Zhou Xinmin, Nan Hanchen, Xu Deheng, Xu Zhizhen, Ma Xiwu, Chen Shaoyu, Chen Jinkun, Chen Da, Xu Yongzuo, Guo Guanjie, Zhang Shushi, Zhang Zhirang, Zhang Xitong, Chu Tunan, Dong Biwu, Deng Yingchao, Deng Chumin, Pan Zhenya, Qian Duansheng, Ji Gongquan, Xie Juezai, Luo Ruiqing, Pang Jinqing, and Yan Jingyao were elected as the 41 members of the preparatory committee of the China New Legal Science Research Association. The establishment of the preparatory committee of the China New Legal Science Research Association was announced, and the meeting adjourned. (Lu Hao)

　　中国新法学研究会发起人会
  　讨论建设新法律
    通过暂行简章成立筹委会
    【本报特讯】中国新法学研究会发起人大会于六月二十六日假华北人民政府会议厅召开。发起人九十余人，除原尚未至北平者外，几乎全体到会（全部发起人名单附后）。会议日程是：（一）报告开会意义；（二）报告及讨论暂行简章草案；（三）推举筹备委员会。会议由沈钧儒主席，并报告开会意义，他说明：“新法律的建设，目前已十分迫切，我们在军事上已经把反动军队打垮，但为了要有一个巩固的新民主主义的国家制度和安宁的社会秩序，就需要建立人民自己的法律。”他着重提出：“建设新民主主义国家需要新法律，必须要有新的观点，才能创造真正为人民所需要的法律。”因此，他号召一切从事法律工作的人们，尤其是学过反动的六法全书的人们，认真地学习马列主义与毛泽东思想的社会观、国家观与法律观，认真地研究新法学，批判旧法学，以便改造自己的思想，为人民服务。他指出：新法学研究会的发起，正是为的使法学界同人能有各种自我学习研究的机会。继由陈绍禹报告中国新法学研究会暂行简章草案（简章草案全文附后）。他逐条说明简章草案各条文的内容涵义，尤其着重说明一、二、三、四各条的内容涵义。使到会人对于中国新法学研究会的定名、性质与任务以及会员入会条件的规定，对于学习马列主义与毛泽东思想的社会观、国家观与法律观的必要，对于研究新法学批判旧法学，并将研究所得为人民服务的办法，得到清晰的共同认识；对于新法学研究会的各种组织及工作的说明，尤其是可能设立新法学研究院以及办理读书问答处与法学函授工作等的说明，更使到会人觉得法学界同人学习研究的机会颇多，甚感兴奋。旋即展开对暂行简章草案的讨论，许德珩、周新民、陈瑾昆、王昆仑、钱端升、王乃堂、蒯晋德、冀贡泉、何思敬、杨绍萱、贾潜、关世雄、邢之襄、吴昱恒、史良、谢道仁、孟庆树、王越成、安志诚、张德含等均先后发言，并不少发言两次至三次者，并有许多以书面提出意见者，大家除提出对某些条文文字修改意见外，均一致表示同意通过中国新法学研究会暂行简章草案，一方面作为将来向成立大会提供的简章草案，另方面即作为筹备委员会进行工作的根据。各位发言人对新法学研究会的组织及工作，尤其热烈地发表了各种提议和意见。林伯渠发言特别对参加新法学研究会同人努力学习研究新法学，以便帮助新民主主义政权的立法工作、司法工作与法学教育工作表示关切。闭幕前，董必武赶到致词，他大意说：“旧的反动法律和新民主主义的中国社会格格不入，今天，我们宣布了废除国民党的六法全书，但要在思想上完全粉碎旧法律的思想体系，则还须加以彻底的批判，只有这样，才能完全消灭它的影响。目前我们虽无所谓完备的法典，但解放区已有很多单行条例、纲领、命令、法律大纲、决议等提供我们研究学习。”他希望大家学习马列主义与毛泽东思想的社会观、国家观与法律观，共同努力建设新法律的完整体系，从理论到条文都表现出新法学的特点。会议至此，决定将对简章草案所提的意见，交选出的筹委会加以考虑修改。次即推选新法学研究会筹备委员会委员，当推出王之相、王炳南、王昆仑、王笑一、王斐然、史良、左宗纶、沈钧儒、沙千里、李克农、李木庵、李达、李六如、吴昱恒、吴传颐、林伯渠、孟庆树、周新民、南汉宸、许德珩、许之桢、马锡五、陈绍禹、陈瑾昆、陈达、徐永祚、郭冠杰、张曙时、张志让、张锡彤、楚图南、董必武、邓颖超、邓初民、潘震亚、钱端升、冀贡泉、谢觉哉、罗瑞卿、庞荩青、严景耀四十一人为中国新法学研究会的筹备委员会委员。宣告中国新法学研究会筹备委员会成立，即散会。（陆灏）
