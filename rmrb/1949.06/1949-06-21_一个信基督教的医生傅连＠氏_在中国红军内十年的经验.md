    A Christian Doctor Fu Lianzhang's Ten Years of Experience in the Chinese Red Army
    Shanghai Correspondence
    At the end of January this year, I personally met Dr. Fu Rixin, also known as Fu Lianzhang. He is a Christian doctor who became associated with the Chinese Anti-Japanese Red Army very early on. He was formerly the president of the Gospel Hospital established by the London Missionary Society in Tingzhou, Fujian. Later, the Soviet government was established, including Tingzhou, and Fu, a humanitarian and patriotic person, went to work in the General Health Department of the Red Army. In 1933, his hospital moved to Yeping, outside Ruijin, the Soviet capital at the time, and became the Central Red Hospital of Jiangxi. Fu was appointed as the president of the hospital. When the main force of the Red Army began the Long March north to resist Japan, Dr. Fu voluntarily requested to go along, taking care of the wounded soldiers and officers along the way, without complaining of fatigue. He is now the president of the Central Soviet Hospital in northern Shaanxi.
    Dr. Fu is a member of the Chinese Medical Association. When he spoke with me, he repeatedly spoke as a member of the association and called on his comrades in the association to prepare for perfect medical, pharmaceutical, and other supplies for the future anti-Japanese war. His experience in the Chinese Red Army is of great interest to all doctors, because these experiences have enriched his medical knowledge and social thought. He strictly practiced the Christian doctrine of brotherly love for mankind, and at the same time, he practiced the humanitarian perspective of medical service. My conversation with him is as follows:
    My home is about fifty miles away from Tingzhou, and the circumstances are very poor. My mother is now eighty years old. Both my parents are devout Christians, so I became a Christian in my childhood. When I was young, a foreign missionary doctor named Cecil Blair, a Briton, helped my wife and me to study in a primary school. He gave us four silver dollars a month. After we graduated, my wife took a job as a teacher in a primary school, and I was still helped by the missionary to enter a middle school. Another foreign doctor, named Mitchell, a Canadian, also helped me to receive education.
    After graduating from middle school, I began to study medicine at the Ashengton School and Hospital. After graduating in five years, I worked as an itinerant doctor in eight counties. After four years of this, I served as a general medicine teacher in a medical school for four years, and was also a doctor at the Ashengton School and the Provincial Men's and Women's Teachers' Schools. In 1918, I was elected as the chief doctor of the Tingzhou Red Cross. Later, I was bedridden for two years due to tuberculosis, but I returned to work in 1925.
    In 1925, because of the May 30th Patriotic Movement, I sent a telegram to oppose British and Japanese imperialism. All foreign doctors in Tingzhou left the city, and I was appointed as the president of Tingzhou Gospel Hospital. The following year, I read a book, namely Qu Qiubai's "New Social Outlook," which gave me a very deep impression and opened up a new perspective for me, so I sympathized with the revolution. In 1927, when the Nanchang Uprising took place, the first batch of revolutionary troops passed through Tingzhou. In this army were Yun Daiying (later killed), Ye Ting, He Long, Lin Boqu, Zhu De, Guo Moruo, and others. They left three hundred wounded soldiers in my hospital, and I healed them all. I asked the female students of the school to act as nurses, and raised donations from merchants in the name of fraternity and humanity to pay for the treatment, which was very satisfactory.
    I have a niece who is a Communist Party member and participated in the Nanchang Uprising. Later, she returned to her hometown and worked secretly in Tingzhou. Not long after, the brother of Zhang Dingcheng, chairman of the Provincial Soviet, was arrested, and a list of Communist Party members in Tingzhou was found in his home. At that time, a division commander of the Kuomintang army was lying ill in my hospital. I treated all patients and wounded people, regardless of their political views or activities. This division commander was very grateful for my treatment, so he told me that there was a Communist in my home, and showed me the telegram of the list of men and women to be arrested and executed. I immediately notified my niece and all the men and women on the list, so they all left Tingzhou, and all the party members were rescued.
    During my time as a doctor, I served the Kuomintang army and the Red Army in the same way. But because I came from a poor and oppressed family, I sympathized with the Communist Party. My parents were always burdened by debt, and the Communist Party strives to liberate the poor and oppressed to realize their doctrine, so I sympathize with them and love them.
    In March 1929, Zhu De and Mao Zedong led troops from Jinggang Mountain to Tingzhou. Their team had smallpox, but there was not a single doctor in the whole team. Zhu and Mao ordered the whole army to be vaccinated in my hospital, which took three weeks. During this period, we also treated most of their injured. When the Fourth Red Army—as it was then called—left Tingzhou, I sent two of my medical students to serve with the army. One of them, Huang Cheng, died of illness in the Red Army in 1930, and the other, Ye Qingshan, is still in the Red Army, working in the health department of Peng Dehuai's headquarters.
    In 1929 and 1930, Tingzhou was an area of guerrilla warfare and was repeatedly lost and gained in the hands of the Red Army. I treated the wounded on both sides without partiality. At the end of 1929, on the eve of the Chinese Lunar New Year, Jin Handing, commander of the Kuomintang army, led his troops to surround my residence, saying that I was a Communist Party member and had relations with the Red Army. But as a result of the search, no evidence was found, so they looted my money and watch and left. I protested against this robbery, and the next day they began to send back the money and watch.
    During this period, three things happened that made my position very dangerous. Once, after I healed a Red Guard member who had suffered eight wounds, I gave him fifty silver dollars to send him away. At the same time, my cousin Fu Lianbiao was captured by the Kuomintang army, saying that he was a Communist, and killed him. Later, my nephew Fu Beide, namely Fu Baoluo, was also captured from my home, saying that he was a Communist, and killed him as well. But because of my good reputation among the people, I was spared.
    In the second half of 1931, Tingzhou became a solid Soviet area. After the Red Army came, my hospital was filled with wounded soldiers. At that time, I had very few medicines, so I sent my student Huang Weijin to Shanghai to buy medicines. After the first batch of medicines was safely transported, I sent him on a second trip. He was captured by Chen Jitang on the way and lost his life. As a result, three people who were closely related to me were killed, but what makes me gratified is that they all bravely went to their execution. At the time of execution, they shouted slogans in support of the Communist Party, and later their photos were hung high in the Central Museum of Jiangxi.
    In January 1932, the Soviet Central Government invited me to train the sixty male and female nurses who were sent. I happily took on that task. In March 1933, I moved my hospital from Tingzhou to Yeping, about ten miles outside Ruijin, the Soviet capital. I sent all the medicines and equipment to Yeping and established the Central Red Hospital. The Central Government also established the Central Medical School in the area, and I immediately began to train twenty doctors. I was very busy at the time, so I could not take on the work of training nurses.
    In 1934, He Cheng was appointed as the Minister of Health, and he is now the Minister of the General Health Department of the Front. We merged the medical school into a health school, and He became the president of the school. Later, the Red Hospital was reorganized into an affiliated hospital of the school, and I was still the president of the hospital. In addition to me, there were four doctors in the hospital. Among the four, two were Red doctors and two were captured from the Nanjing army; but they were also very conscientious, so they were also treated favorably by the Soviet government. At that time, we had thirty nurses. I don't know how many people the school had trained, but there were many, that's what I know. In the medical school alone, one hundred people had been trained to be doctors. We trained a large number of nurses sent by the Red Army. We had many problems in medical services. I sent students to Shanghai to learn how to make absorbent cotton. We didn't have enough medicines, so we had to make them ourselves.
    When the National Soviet Congress was held in January 1934, I was appointed to take care of the health of the Soviet representatives. In April of the same year, after the National Hospital was established, I became the president of the hospital. On October 10th, the Long March began, and I asked to go along. Xiang Ying, Vice Chairman of the Soviet Government, stayed in southern Jiangxi, because my health was not good, and I was afraid that I could not stand the hardship of the long journey, so he asked me to stay with him in the area. But as a result of my insistence, I was finally allowed. On the first leg of the journey, they gave me a sedan chair to sit in. Later, when I learned to ride a horse, they gave me a horse to ride. During the Long March north to resist Japan in 1936, I worked in the Fourth Front Army of the Red Army in Xikang. In December of the same year, we joined forces with the Central Red Army in Gansu, and thus came to Shaanxi. I am now the president of the Central Soviet Hospital in northern Shaanxi.
    I am not a Communist Party member. Originally, I wanted to join the party, but my body was very bad, and I could not stand the hard work of the group or branch. I have stayed in the Red Army for so many years (ten years) for the following reasons: First, I felt that I belonged to an oppressed nation and an oppressed class; second, I was moved by the Communist educators and leader Qu Qiubai; third, it was my duty to do so, because although there were many sick and wounded in the Red Army at the beginning, there were no doctors, and I felt that I should do this work. The Red Army is a real people's army fighting for the country - this fact I have clearly recognized from many years of experience. It is the most disciplined army protecting the country and the masses of the people. The Red Army soldiers' attitude towards doctors is not arrogant, which is completely different from the mercenary army. Also, the reason why I stayed in the Red Army is because I firmly believe that it showed me the way to the liberation of the nation and the Chinese people.
    I am a Christian, which every Red Army soldier knew in the past, and they still know today. But I have never been persecuted by the Red Army or the Communist Party because of my Christian faith. It is not correct to say that the Red Army persecutes Christians because of their different beliefs, that is just a rumor fabricated by the reactionaries. If, a long time ago, some Christians had a bad relationship with the Red Army, it was not because of their faith, but because of their opposition to revolutionary activities. I am a Christian, and I am constantly protected and respected by the Red Army, the Communist Party, and the Soviet government. Completely of my own volition, I have been with the Red Army for many years. During the Jinggangshan period, the Red Army only had two thousand rifles, now it is a hundred times that number. My confidence in the Red Army has been confirmed.
    At this point in the conversation, I asked Dr. Fu to explain in detail the reasons why he had many opportunities to leave the Red Army but remained within it. He replied: When I was very young, I heard words of fraternity and friendship in the church. But later, when I became involved with the Red Army, I realized that they loved not only friends and family, but also the country and the masses of the people. In the past, I could earn two hundred silver dollars a month from practicing medicine, in addition to the salary I received from the church hospital. My family and I were able to eat our fill without worry. Later, because of my faith, I left my old mother, wife, and four sons in Fujian and joined the Red Army to do medical service. I was very willing to make the 25,000-mile Long March, although many people were afraid that I could not withstand such hardships. Indeed, I almost lost my life twice. Once in southern Hunan, I fell off my horse into a deep river. Once again, in Xikang, on the Jiajin Mountain and the Dangcen Mountain, I lost consciousness due to the thin air. For forty days and forty nights, I and other personnel shared the difficulties of the grassland. I had diarrhea and was in great pain. Medical personnel and supplies were often bombed by enemy planes, but my faith did not waver. I went through many dangers, but these dangers were not as great as the danger when the Kuomintang army surrounded me, killed my relatives and students, and accused me of being a Communist sympathizer.
    I am not the only Christian in the Red Army and the Soviet government. Many doctors have come over to the Red Army from the Kuomintang army, many of whom are Christians, and most of them were initially unsympathetic to communism. But this does not matter to us. We usually hold meetings to welcome them and ask them to use their medical knowledge to serve the Chinese nation. In these meetings, I often tell them about my experience in the Red Army and ask them to cooperate with us without any fear. They listened to my words, and many not only became sympathizers but also joined the Communist Party, such as Dr. Wang Bin, who is now the president of the Soviet Shaanxi Medical School, but he was originally the military medical officer of Chiang Kai-shek's 80th Division. Dr. Li Zhi, another doctor who came from the Kuomintang army, also became a Communist Party member and is now the dean of our medical school. There is also Dr. Dai Jimin, who is the chief of the military medical department of the First Front Red Army.
    It can be said that all the doctors like the Red Army and like to work in the Soviet area. Few people, it can be said that no one, is not moved by the spirit of self-sacrifice of the masses of the people. According to our work as doctors, we receive clothing, food, housing, service, and protection, and monthly allowances. If our work requires us to go somewhere, we go immediately. Because of the external encirclement and the civil war, our economic situation is difficult. However, we still like life in the Red Army. This life has national goals, and it is not just for making a living.
    We have many medical problems in the Red Army. Our problem is not only to take care of the Red Army and the Soviet government. If that was the only problem, it would be easier to solve. But wherever we go, wherever we live, we must take care of all the local residents. Under the old rule, the people in these places never received any unpaid medical care. They have all kinds of diseases. So our hospital immediately became a public hospital for the surrounding residents, and their needs were even greater than those of our Red Army and government. Our doctors and medicines immediately serve the people, and sometimes we have to sacrifice our care for the Red Army for this reason. For example, in the Northwest, there are widespread social diseases and infectious diseases, and the people have no idea what personal or public health is. We have found many infectious diseases here, such as typhoid fever, plague, epidemic fever, and other prevalent diseases such as venereal disease, tuberculosis, and trachoma. We often have the task of eradicating such diseases and infectious diseases. Because of the encirclement and civil war in recent years, our work has been greatly hampered. We lack modern trained doctors and nurses, medicines and sera for acute infectious diseases, and hospital equipment. At the same time, we often have pressing problems of our own army, because our army is composed of workers and peasants, many of whom are local people, and who often join the Red Army.
    Since 1935, the Chinese Communist Party has implemented new policies in a new environment, and therefore many new problems have arisen in the medical field. We are an increasingly expanding anti-Japanese army, and we are preparing for the coming anti-Japanese war. Like other anti-Japanese troops in the country, we urgently need modern doctors of all kinds, whether they are foreigners, natives, men or women. We need military doctors and specialists of all kinds. Where there are no scientific methods of childbirth and scientific methods of treating women, we need female doctors. No matter how hard and diligently we work, we still cannot meet the various needs before us.
    According to our experience, few of the doctors and nurses in the Chinese army have received modern training. Moreover, doctors who have received the latest training are happy to live and work in big cities to earn money for their families and live a comfortable life. Also, there is still an incorrect concept of the army and soldiers among intellectuals. Even among modern educated men and women, it is often heard that if you treat soldiers politely and treat their illnesses and injuries, they will not become good soldiers. This is a dark and harmful attitude, and we must strike it down and eliminate it. We must remember that in the last World War, the US government alone mobilized three thousand modern doctors to take care of soldiers, so there was one doctor for every fifty people. The current task of the anti-Japanese army is much heavier than the task of the US army at that time. All our national doctors, nurses, and medical students must prepare themselves for the coming war in order to liberate our country and people from Japanese imperialism and shameless traitors. On this task, all kinds of medical workers must bear a considerable burden with the masses. We cannot leave the liberation of our country to the masses alone, making them suffer and die, while we have the possibility to prevent such sacrifices. Therefore, we call on all doctors, nurses, and public health workers to help us, to help all the anti-Japanese troops in our country, to bring their latest scientific training and do their best to apply it here. For example, in our army, there is one who was trained in the Shanghai Baolong Hospital, and he brings very high medical training and practical experience. He is one of our best medical workers. We need many people like him.
    I myself am a member of the Chinese Medical Association, and many members of the association know me very well. The association can do many things in the aforementioned direction. I hope that people in this organization will help us and other anti-Japanese troops during the anti-Japanese war. We hope that many doctors and nurses across the country will prepare themselves with the utmost sincerity and attention in order to work in the anti-Japanese army. They should pay attention to wartime surgery, hygiene, and all aspects of medicine related to the army and civilians, because civilians are the reserve army of our anti-Japanese soldiers, and they must become our strongest social foundation in this war. In China, with widespread infectious diseases and various social diseases, we cannot build a strong, healthy, and effective army. We urgently need modern doctors of all kinds, wartime surgeons, and nurses who have received the best training. Nevertheless, we believe that the military medical service of our Red Army is the best in the country. Our experience has taught us. Our situation is difficult, but we know that if the encirclement and civil war stop, then we will solve all the problems concerning the army and public health in all the places where we are stationed. This is only a material problem for us.
    If you ask me what we need today, I can give you a very long list. First, we need to stop the civil war. We need modern doctors and nurses who can work in harsh environments. We need all kinds of books on wartime surgery, public health, and military hygiene. We need surgical instruments and various hospital equipment, which are not only extremely needed for our large army, but also necessary for civilians. We need various immune sera to prevent and treat various infectious and social diseases of the remnant and poisoned people in the Northwest. We need all the supplies and mobile medicines for the hospital. We need first aid medicines, equipment, and personnel. We need modern laboratory staff, equipment, microscopes, microbiology staff, and equipment.
    Naturally, the whole country needs gas masks. Our country needs an international movement to continuously oppose poison gas warfare and microbial warfare, because in the future war against Japanese imperialism, we will encounter this danger. Such a war is much more harmful to the residents than to the army. We appeal to the World Red Cross and the Chinese Red Cross to help us and all the anti-Japanese troops in China.
    I am personally very grateful to the several pharmaceutical companies outside Fujian and Jiangxi that gave us medicines in those days. Because of the encirclement and traffic difficulties, we were unable to pay off the debt of two to three thousand yuan to one company. But we have not forgotten our debt, and when the time comes in the future, we must pay off this debt.
    Perhaps doctors are particularly willing to know what diseases and disabilities I have seen in my experience as a doctor in the past few years. Naturally, the social environment in China makes many of these diseases almost extremely common. Now let me talk about what I have personally seen:
    In southern China, our main problems are gunshot wounds, foot ulcers, gangrene, anemia, intestinal parasites, tuberculosis, malaria, dysentery, enteric fever, meningitis, trachoma, smallpox, and twelve other diseases. In Jiangxi, Guangdong, Hunan, and Guangxi, during our Long March north to resist Japan, we encountered and suffered from malaria, dysentery, and enteric fever. In Yunnan, Guizhou, and Sichuan, we passed through many counties where almost all the residents were infected with goiter and exophthalmos. In Xikang, our army suffered from altitude sickness, malnutrition, indigestion, diarrhea, and dysentery. In Sichuan, Gansu, and northern Shaanxi, most of the residents suffer from long-term venereal disease. In northern Shaanxi, Shanxi, and Inner Mongolia, many social diseases seriously affect the reproduction of the race, and sometimes large areas of the people die as a result. Although a bad social environment is also one of the reasons, social diseases are indeed the cause.
    The doctors and medical workers in our Red Army often have major tasks in these places. We must take care of the residents where we are located. This is a serious task, and we call on patriotic doctors to join our work or give us the necessary material assistance.
    This is a brief account of my life and work.
            January 30, 1937.

    一个信基督教的医生傅连＠氏
    在中国红军内十年的经验
    上海通讯
    今年正月底我亲身晤见医生傅日新，即傅连ｚｈāｎｇ＠①氏。他是一个信奉基督教的医生，很早就和中国反日红军发生联系。他从前是伦敦教会在福建汀州设立之福音医院的院长。后来苏维埃政府成立，包括了汀州，而人道主义者和爱国志士的傅氏，遂到红军总卫生部工作。一九三三年，他的医院迁移到当时苏维埃京都瑞金城外的叶坪，成为江西之中央红色医院，傅氏即被委为该医院院长。当红军主力开始北上抗日的长征时，傅医生自动要求同行，沿途照顾伤兵将士，不辞劳瘁。他现在是陕北中央苏维埃医院的院长。
    傅医生是中华医学会的会员，当他与我谈话时，屡次以该会会员的资格讲话，并号召该会的同志准备将来抗日战争中之完善的医务以及医药的和其他的供给。他在中国红军内的经验对于一切医生是具有极大的趣味的，因为这些经验使他的医疗的学术和社会思想更形丰富。他对于基督教义上之人类的弟兄爱，是严格地身体力行的，同时医务上之人道观点，他正是实践了。他与我的谈话如下：
    我的家离汀州约五十里，境况非常贫苦，我的母亲现年八十岁。父母双亲均是虔敬的基督教徒，因之我童年亦即成了基督徒。当我幼时，一位外国教会医生，名叫锡依布莱尔，英国人，帮助我和我的妻在一个初级学校读书，他每月给我们四元大洋。我们毕业后，我的妻即在一初级小学担任教师之职，而我仍由该传教士的帮助，进了一个中学校。还有一位外国医生，名叫米企尔者，加拿大人，也帮助我受教育。
    中学毕业后，我即开始在亚盛顿学校和医院内研究医药，五年毕业后，即在八个县内做游历的医生。这样经过了四年后，我又在医校担任了普通医药教职四年，同时也是亚盛顿学校及省立男中与女师的医生。一九一八年我被举为汀州红十字会的主任医生。后来我因肺痨卧病两年，但于一九二五年回来继续工作。
    一九二五年，因为五卅爱国运动，我曾通电反对英、日帝国主义，汀州一切外国医生均离开了该城，而我遂被派为汀州福音医院的院长。次年，我读了一本书，即瞿秋白所著之新社会观，它给了我一极深刻的印象，替我开辟了一个新见地，而我就因此同情革命。一九二七年南昌起义时，头一批革命军经过汀州。在这个军内有恽代英（后被难）叶挺贺龙林伯渠朱德郭沫若等。他们在我的医院留下三百个伤兵，我均把他们医好。我请学校女生做看护妇，并以博爱和人道名义向商人募捐作治疗之费，结果异常完满。
    我有一人侄女是共产党员，曾参加南昌起义。后来他回到家乡，秘密地在汀州工作。不久后，省苏维埃主席张鼎丞之弟被捕，在他家内发现了汀州共产党员的名单。当时一个国民党军队的师长卧病于我的医院。我治疗一切病人伤人，不问他们的政治观点或活动。这位师长对我的治疗非常感激，所以告我说我的家里有一个共产党人，并将命令逮捕和枪毙的男女名单之电报见示。我立即通知我的侄女和该名单上的一切男女，于是他们全体离开了汀州，全部党员得以救护。
    在我做医生的这个时间，我替国民党军队和红军一样地服务。但因我出身于贫寒和被压迫者之家，所以我同情于共产党。我的父母无时不受债务之累，共产党努力于解放穷苦和被压迫者去实现他们的主义，所以我同情他们，爱护他们。
    一九二九年三月，朱德和毛泽东由井冈山率领军队到汀州来，他们队伍里发生了天花，但全队没有一个医生。朱毛命全军在我的医院内种痘，这样费了三星期；在这个期间，我们又医治好了他们的大部受伤者。红四军——当时的名称是这样——离开汀州时，我派遣我的两个医科学生随军服务，其中之一，黄成，于一九三○年在红军里病死，另一位，叶青山，现尚留在红军内，他在彭德怀司令部卫生部做负责工作。
    在一九二九与一九三○年中，汀州是游击战争的区域，曾在红军手中屡得屡失。我医治双方受伤者，无所偏袒。一九二九年末，当中国旧历新年之夜，国民党军队司令金汉鼎率军包围了我的住宅，说我是一个共产党党员，与红军有关系。但搜索的结果，没有找到任何证据，乃掠夺我的钱和表而去。我对这个抢劫提出了抗议，次日彼始将钱和表送还。
    在这个期内，发生了三个事情，弄得我的地位非常危险。有一次我把一个身受八处伤的赤卫队队员医治好了后，给他五十元大洋遣之去。同时我的堂弟傅连标为国民党军队捕去，说他是共党，把他杀死。后来我的侄子傅备德即傅保罗亦由我家内捕去，说他是共党，亦将之杀死。但是因为我在民间的声誉好，故免于难。
    一九三一年后半年，汀州变成了一个巩固的苏维埃区域。红军来到后，我的医院，就充满了伤兵。我当时的药品非常少，所以派遣我的一个学生黄卫金，赴上海购药。第一批药品安全地运来后，我又派遣他作第二次的行程。他在路上为陈济棠捕获，因而丧命。结果，与我有密切关系的三人均被杀了，但令我告慰的地方就是他们都是英勇地就刑了。临刑时，他们高喊拥护共党的口号，后来他们的相片均高悬于江西中央博物院内。
    一九三二年正月，苏维埃中央政府，请我训练送来的六十位男女看护。我高兴地担任了那项工作。一九三三年三月我把我的医院由汀州迁至苏维埃京都瑞金城外约十里之叶坪。我把一切药品和器具等都送到叶坪，建立了中央红色医院。中央政府也在该地设立了中央医学校，我就马上开始去训练二十个医生。当时我非常忙，所以不能担任训练看护的工作。
    一九三四年贺诚被任为卫生部部长，他现在是前方总卫生部部长。我们把医学校合并为卫生学校，贺即为该校校长，后红色医院改组为该校的附属医院，我照旧是该院的院长。在该医院的医生，除我之外，还有四个。那四位中间，两位是红色医生，两位是由南京军队俘掳来的；可是他们也很尽职，所以也得到苏维埃政府的优待。当时我们有三十个看护。我不知道该校曾训练出来好多人，但为数甚多，这是我所知道的。只在医学校内，已训练了一百人去做医生。我们训练了由各红军送来的大批看护。我们在医药服务中有很多问题。我派学生赴沪去学习制造药棉。我们的药品不够，所以不得不自己制造。
    当一九三四年正月全国苏维埃大会时，我被委派去照顾苏维埃代表的健康。同年四月，国家医院成立后，我做该院的院长。十月十日长征开始，我要求同行。苏维埃政府副主席项英留守赣南，因为我的身体不好，恐怕受不了长途跋涉之苦，所以他叫我与他同留该地。但我坚持的结果，终得了允准。在头一段路上，他们给我轿坐。到后来我学会骑马时，他们就给我一匹马骑。在一九三六年北上抗日长征中，我在西康红四方面军工作。同年十二月我们复与甘肃之中央红军联合，因而来到陕西。我现在是陕北中央苏维埃医院的院长。
    我不是一个共产党党员。原来我想入党，但我的身体很坏，受不了小组或支部艰苦的工作。我留在红军中这么多年（十年）是由于以下的原因：第一我感觉到我是属于一个受压迫的民族和受压迫的阶级；第二我受了共产党教育家和领袖瞿秋白氏的感动；第三责任所在义不容辞，因为红军在最初时虽然有许多病伤者，然没有医生，我就感觉到我应当去做这个工作。红军是为国家奋斗的真正人民的军队——这个事实我从多年经验中认识清楚了。它是一个保护国家和人民群众的最有纪律的军队。红军战士对医生的态度不是骄慢的，在这方面与雇佣军队完全不同。还有我之所以留于红军中者是因为我深信它指示了我以民族和中国人民大众之解放的道路。
    我是一个基督徒，这是每个红军战士过去所知道的，他们现在也知道。但我从来未曾因为信仰基督教而被红军或共产党所逼害。说红军因为信仰不同而迫害基督徒是不正确的，那只是反动者之造谣。如果很久以前，有些基督徒与红军发生过不良的关系，那并不是因为他们的信仰，而是因为他们反对革命的活动。我是一个基督徒，而我经常地受到红军共产党和苏维埃政府的保护和尊敬的。完全由我的自动，我已经与红军相处多年了。在井冈山时期，红军只有来复枪二千支，现在则百倍那个数目。我对红军的信心是被证实了。
    谈至此时，我就请傅医生详细说明，他有很多机会脱离红军而留在红军内不去的原因。他回答道：从前我极幼时，在教堂里听到博爱和友善的话。但于后来和红军发生关系时，才知道他们不只爱朋友和家庭，而且爱国家和人民大众。从前我由行医每月可获二百元大洋，此外还有教会医院所领薪金。我和我的家庭得以饱食无虑。后来因为信仰，才把我的老母妻室和四个儿子留下在福建而投入红军做医科上的服务。我很甘愿作二万五千里的长征，虽然有好多人怕我受不了这样的艰苦。确实的，我两次几乎丧命。有一次在湘南我落马坠深河中。再一次在西康甲金山党岑山时我因空气稀薄而昏去不省人事。四十天四十夜我和其他人员共尝草地上的困苦。我曾泻肚，痛苦不堪。医药人员和给养时常受到敌人飞机的轰炸，但是我的信仰毫未动摇。我经过许多的危险，但这样危险都赶不上当时国民党军队把我包围起来，把我的亲戚和学生杀死，控我是一个共党的同情者那样的危险。
    我并不是红军和苏维埃政府内之唯一的基督徒。红军由国民党军队方面还过来很多医生，中间许多是基督徒，大多数起初是不同情于共产主义的。但这对于我们无关要紧。我们照例开会欢迎他们，请他们拿他们的医学知识为中国民族服务。在这些大会里，我时常把我在红军内的经验告诉他们，请他们毫无疑惧地和我们合作。他们听了我的话，许多不仅成了同情者而且加入了共产党，如王斌医生，现在是苏维埃陕北医学的校长，但他原来是蒋介石第八十师的军医长。李治医生，另一个从国民党军过来的医生，也成一个共产党员，现在是我们医学校的教务主任。还有戴济民医生，他是第一方面红军的军医处长。
    医生们可说是全体都喜欢红军，都喜欢在苏区内工作的。很少人，可说是没有人，不受人民大众自我牺牲的精神之感动。我们按照我们医生的工作，得到衣食住服役和护卫，和每月的津贴。如果我们的工作需要我们到什么地方去，我们就马上去。因为外面的包围和内战，我们的经济状况是艰难的。然而我们还是喜欢红军内的生活。这个生活有民族的目的，而不是只是为的谋生。
    我们在红军内有许多医药问题。我们的问题不仅仅是去照顾红军和苏维埃政府。如果只是这个问题，那是比较容易解决的。但是我们无论到什么地方去，住在什么地方，我们必须照顾当地的一切居民。在旧的统治下，这些地方的人民从没有得到任何无报酬的医疗。他们有各种各样的疾病。所以我们的医院马上成为周围居民的公共医院了，而且他们的需要比我们红军和政府还要大些。我们的医生和医药品马上给人民服务，有时为此而不得不牺牲我们对红军的照顾。例如在西北有广布的社会疾病和传染症，人民一点都不知道什么是个人或公共卫生。我们发现此地有许多传染症如伤寒，鼠疫，瘟热病，和其他流行的疾病如花柳，肺痨和沙眼。我们常有铲除这种疾病和传染病的任务。因为近年来的包围和内战，我们的这项工作受到了不少的阻碍。我们缺乏受过现代训练的医生和看护，药品和急性传染病用的血清，以及医院设备种种。同时，我们经常有我们自己军队的紧迫问题，因为我们的军队是由工农组成的，有很多是本地人，经常地加入红军。
    从一九三五年起，中国共产党在新的环境下，实行了新的政策，因此医药界也发生了许多新问题。我们是日益扩大的反日军，我们准备来日的抗日战争。我们一如国内其他反日军队，迫切地需要近代的各种医生，不管其为外国人，本国人，男人或女人。我们需要军医和各种的专家。在没有科学的接生方法和科学的妇女治疗方法的地方，我们需要女医生。无论我们工作怎样努力和勤奋，然尚不能满足我们面前之各种需要。
    据我们的经验，中国军队的医生和看护当中，很少受过现代的训练。再者受过最新式训练的医生，都乐意在大城市里居住工作，去替他们的家庭赚钱，谋安乐的生活。还有在知识分子内，尚存着对军队和兵士不正确的观念。即在受过现代教育的男女中间常听到这样的意见：如果你对待兵士客气，医治他们的病伤，则他们不会成好的战士。这是一个黑暗有害的态度，我们不能不给它以打击，把它消灭。我们须记得，在上次世界大战时，仅美国政府就已动员了三千个近代医生去照顾兵士，所以每五十个人就有一个医生。抗日军队当前的任务较当时美国军队的任务重得多了。我们全国的医生，看护和我们的医科学生必须为来日的战争去准备自己，以便把我们的国家和人民从日本帝国主义和ｔｉǎｎ＠②然无耻的汉奸手中解脱出来。在这个任务上，各种医学工作人员必须与群众负相当的重担。我们不能把我们国家的解放只让给群众去做，使他们受累死亡，同时我们有可能去阻止这样的牺牲。因此我们号召一切医生看护和公共卫生的工作人员来帮助我们，帮助我国的一切抗日军队，把他们的最新的科学训练带来，尽力在此施用。例如在我们的军队内有一位是从前在上海宝隆医院受过训练的，他带来很高的医学训练和实际经验。他是我们最好的医药工作人员之一。我们需要很多象他这样的人。
    我本人是中华医学会的会员，该会许多会员都很认识我。该会很能在前述的方向上做许多事情。我盼望这个组织内的人在抗日战争时会援助我们和其他的反日军队。我们盼望全国许多医生看护将以极诚恳和最大的注意力去准备自己以便在抗日军队内工作。他们要注意战争时的外科、卫生以及与军队和平民有关系的医药各方面，因为平民是我们反日战士的后备军，他们必须成为我们在这个战争中的最强固的社会基础。在广播的传染病和各种社会疾病的中国，我们是不能建立起来一个坚强康健和有效能军队。我们非常需要各种现代医生，战时外科医生和受过最好训练的看护。虽然如此，然而我们相信我们的红军的军医服务在全国内是最好的。我们的经验教训了我们。我们的境况是艰难的，但是我们知道，如果包围和内战停止，则我们会在我们所驻扎的一切地方把一切关于军队和公共卫生的问题解决了的。这对于我们只是一个物质问题。
    如果你问我，我们今天需要什么，我可以给你一个很长的单子。第一我们需要停止内战。我们需要能在艰苦环境中工作的现代医生和看护。我们需要关于战时外科，公共卫生和军队的卫生之各种书籍。我们需要外科器械和各种医院设备，这些不只是对于我们的大军是极其需要，而且对于平民也是必要的。我们需要各种免疫血清去防预、和治疗残毒西北人民之各种传染症和社会疾病。我们需要医院之一切给养和流动的医药等。我们需要急救的药品、器具和人员。我们需要现代试验室的工作人员、用具、显微镜，微生物工作人员和设备。
    自然，全国需要防毒面具。我们的国家需要一个国际的运动无间断地去反对毒瓦斯的战争和微生物的战争，因为在将来反日本帝国主义战争中，我们是会遇到这个危险的。这样的战争对于居民的损害比较对于军队大得多。我们向世界红十字会中国红十字会呼吁，来援助我们和中国一切的抗日军队。
    我个人非常感激当日我们在福建江西时外面几个医药公司给我们的医药品。因为包围和交通困难，致我们不能把欠一个公司的二千元到三千元的债付清。但我们并没有忘记我们的债务，将来时机到了，我们一定要付清这笔款。
    或许医生们特别愿意知道，我在过去数年中，由我做医生的经验中，看到些一件什么疾病和伤残。自然，中国的社会环境使许多这些疾病几乎极其普遍。现在让我说一说我个人所看到的：
    在中国南方我们主要的问题是枪伤，足部溃疡，坏疽，贫血，肠胃虫症，肺痨，疟疾，痢疾，肠热病，脑膜炎，沙眼，天花，及十二种其他的疾病。在江西广东湖南广西，在我们的北上抗日长征中我们遇到而且遭受了疟疾，痢疾和肠热病。在云南、贵州和四川，我们经过许多县，那里的居民几乎全体都染了甲状腺肿和突眼症。在西康，我们的军队遭受高原病，营养不足，不消化症。泻肚，和痢疾。在四川、甘肃，和陕北，居民大部遭受长久的花柳病。在陕北，山西和内蒙古，很多的社会病，严重地影响了种族的生殖，有时广大区域的人民竟因之死亡殆尽。虽说不好的社会环境也是原因之一，然而社会疾病实有以致然。
    我们红军内的医生和医药工作人员在这些地方经常地有重大的任务。我们必须照顾我们所在地的居民。这是一个严重的任务，我们号召爱国医生来参加我们的工作或给我们以必需的物质援助。
    这就是我的生平和工作之简短的叙述。
            一九三七，一，三十日。
