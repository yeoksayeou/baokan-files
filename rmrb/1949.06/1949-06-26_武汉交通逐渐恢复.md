Xinhua News Agency, Hankou, 25th.  Water, land, postal and telecommunications transportation in the three towns of Wuhan are rapidly recovering. In addition to the Yangtze River routes to Nanjing and Shanghai, which are already open, nearly twenty more inland river routes have been added. There are eight routes from Hankou along the Yangtze River, upstream to Jinkou and downstream to Jiujiang, and ten routes from Hankou along the Han River, upstream to Yuekou and Tianmen, and two routes from Hankou to Xiaogan. More than 70 ships are currently registered to operate on these twenty routes, with a total carrying capacity of over 1,400 tons. In terms of railway transportation, after more than 20 days of emergency repairs on the Pinghan Railway between Hankou and Huayuan, six of the eleven bridges destroyed by the Kuomintang bandit troops have been repaired and completed, and three more are nearing completion. Steel beams are currently being rushed into place. Thanks to the joint efforts of employees and the railway corps, the Yuehan Railway has been opened to traffic on the Wudong (Wuchang East) to Xianning section on the 22nd. In terms of highway transportation, with the cooperation of the highway bureau's engineering team and an engineering regiment of the People's Liberation Army, a large bridge and nine small bridges between Wuchang and Chongyang, as well as thirteen small bridges between Xianning and Wuchang, have been repaired successively, and vehicles are running smoothly. Automobile transportation stations are being added to the highways from Hankou to Macheng and Hankou to Xuanhua Store to strengthen dispatching and supply. With the rapid recovery of water and land transportation, postal and telecommunications lines and services are constantly expanding. Commercial long-distance telegrams and telephone calls are now available to Shanghai, Nanjing and other places. The delivery time for mail from Hankou to Peiping, Tianjin, Shenyang, Harbin and other places has been greatly shortened. Mail from Hankou to Jiujiang, Wuchang to Xianning and other lines can now be delivered on the same day.
