Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, 8th. To increase industrial electricity consumption and develop production, some government organs, factories, and schools in Tianjin have begun to pay attention to saving water and electricity. Since the Tianjin Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party advocated conservation in March, it has saved more than 2,800 kilowatt-hours of electricity in March, April, and May, equivalent to more than 100,000 yuan in People's currency. The Municipal Government used a total of 2,407 kilowatt-hours of electricity in May, saving 464 kilowatt-hours compared to April. The Civil Affairs Bureau reduced water consumption by 42% in May compared to April, and saved 32% in electricity consumption. Employees of the Tram Management Office also consciously practiced thrift. For example, the electricians in the in-house factory used to use 720 kilowatt-hours to bake a single electric roller, but now they bake several together, greatly reducing electricity consumption. Starting in May, they also contacted the Jibei Electric Power Company to closely coordinate power supply time with electricity consumption, reducing waste. A total of nearly 70,000 kilowatt-hours of electricity were saved in March, April, and May. In schools, there used to be serious waste phenomena. For example, Nankai University used an average of 30.87 gallons of water per person per day in March and 15.46 kilowatt-hours of electricity per month, both exceeding the maximum amount stipulated by the Public Utilities Bureau and the Military Control Commission's Culture and Education Department (20 gallons of water per day, 6 kilowatt-hours of electricity per month), resulting in the full month's administrative expenses being used for water and electricity costs. After criticism from the Tianjin Daily, the school has begun to correct this. The dormitory affairs committee organized by Nankai students, in addition to calling on all students to save water and electricity automatically, has also formulated specific water and electricity saving measures. The Beiyang University Student Union has also carried out publicity for saving water and electricity and has formed an electrical equipment improvement committee composed of professors, teaching assistants, staff, students, and workers to reduce electricity consumption.

[Another Dispatch] The workers of the Xinhe Ship Repair Factory of the Haihe Engineering Bureau in Tianjin used their spare time to repair a 98-zhang-long (approximately 326 meters)围墙 wall by themselves, saving an estimated 160,000 jin (80,000kg) of millet in repair costs. The dock crane at the factory entrance fell into the water, and it was originally estimated to require 100,000 jin (50,000kg) of millet for repairs. With the personal help of workers like Kong Fanyou, it only took 2,000 jin (1,000kg) of millet.

[Another Dispatch] Lu Yunjui, an old blacksmith worker at the Tianjin East Station Engine Section, led young workers Cai Ronghua and others to automatically process and produce with scrap iron after work from the 19th of last month. By the 6th of this month, they had made 55 various hand hammers, 35 crowbars, 17 large and small wrenches, 18 large and small pliers, and more than 100 other tools.

　　津市部分机关工厂学校　节省水电发展生产
    电车管理处三月省电七万度
    【新华社天津八日电】津市一部分机关、工厂、学校，为了增加工业用电、发展生产，已开始注意节省水电。中共天津市委机关自三月份提倡节约以来，三、四、五三个月共节省电力二千八百余度，合人民券十万余元。市府五月份共用电二千四百零七度，较四月份节约四百六十四度。民政局五月份用水较四月份减少百分之四十二，消耗电量节省了百分之三十二。电车管理处一般职工也自觉地厉行节约，如内勤厂内电工班从前烤一个电滚子即须用电七二○度，现在凑成几个一起烤，用电大减；五月份起并与冀北电力公司取得联系，使送电时间与用电紧密配合，减少浪费。总计三、四、五三个月共省电近七万度。在学校中，过去一般都存在着严重的浪费现象，如南开大学三月份平均每人每日用水三○·八七加仑，每月用电一五·四六度，都超过了公用局和军管会文教部规定的最高量（每日用水二○加仑，每月用电六度），致全月行政经费几全为水电费用所占用。后经天津日报提出批评，该校已开始改正。由南开同学所组的舍务委员会，除号召全体同学自动节省外，并订立了具体节水节电办法。北洋大学学生会也进行了节省水电的宣传，并由教授、助教、职员、学生、工友等共同组成电力设备改进委员会，力求减少用电。
    【又讯】津市海河工程局新河修理船厂职工，利用工余时间，自己动手修缮了长达九十八丈长的围墙，节约了预计修缮费十六万斤小米。该厂门口码头吊杆落水，原计需小米十万斤修理，在工人孔繁有等亲自动手下，只用了两千斤小米。
    【又讯】天津东站机务段老铁匠工人路云九，带领青年工友蔡荣华等八人，自上月十九日起，每日下班后自动利用废铁加工生产，至本月六日，已做成各种手锤五十五把，撬棍三十五根，大小搬子十七个，大小钳子十八个，及其他工具共百余件。
