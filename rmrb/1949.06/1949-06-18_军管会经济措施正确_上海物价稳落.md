　　Military Control Commission's Economic Measures are Correct
  　Shanghai Commodity Prices Steadily Decline
    [Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 17th] Shanghai's commodity prices are steadily declining. The China Textile Construction Company, upon the orders of the Military Control Commission and the Municipal Government, has begun selling cotton yarn and various colored cotton cloths from the 13th, selling to manufacturers registered with the company and who have resumed operations, based on quoted prices. The Shanghai Trade Corporation Preparatory Office has also been ordered to, in conjunction with relevant authorities, sell grain and cooking oil. The Coal Allocation Office of the East China Resources Committee, in addition to prioritizing coal allocation to public utilities and transportation, is currently conducting investigations and studying specific methods for allocating sales to private manufacturers. Under these measures, along with a series of economic measures taken by the Military Control Commission and the Municipal Government to crack down on silver dollar speculation, redeem and store foreign currencies, manage gold and silver, and implement inflation-adjusted savings, Shanghai's general commodity prices have steadily declined in recent days. Top-quality white polished rice has fallen from a high of 14,560 yuan per dan on the 10th to 12,500 yuan on the 13th, and Bingchuan flour has also fallen from a high of 3,910 yuan per bag on the 9th to 3,050 yuan on the 14th.

　　军管会经济措施正确
  　上海物价稳落
    【新华社上海十七日电】沪市物价平稳下跌。中国纺织建设公司奉军管会及市政府命令，已于十三日起抛售棉纱及各色棉布，以报价核售的方式，售予在该公司登记合格且已复业的厂商。沪市贸易总公司筹备处亦奉命会同有关机关抛售粮食、食油。华东资源委员会煤炭调配处除已对公用和交通事业尽先配煤外，该处现正进行调查并研究对私营厂商配售的具体办法。在这些措施连同军管会及市政府取缔银元投机、收兑收存外币、管理金银、举办折实储蓄等一连串的经济措施下，日来沪市一般物价已平稳下跌。上等白粳米已由十日每担最高一万四千五百六十元跌到十三日的一万二千五百元，兵船面粉亦由九日最高每袋三千九百一十元跌至十四日的三千零五十元。
