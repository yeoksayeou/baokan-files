Xinhua News Agency, Beiping, 21st. "The American economic crisis has developed to the point where it can no longer be obscured by reassuring words." This is the comment made by Bertel, a commentator for the American bourgeois newspaper, the New York Post, on the increasingly serious American economic situation. According to the US Federal Reserve Board, the US production index has fallen from a peak of 195 in October of last year (with 1935-39 as 100) to 175 in May of this year, a continuous drop of 20 points. At the same time, unemployment has been increasing continuously since October of last year. According to a United Press International dispatch on the 18th, citing a report from the Public Affairs Institute, there is no sign that unemployment is stopping, and it is estimated that the number of unemployed will increase to six million in the last quarter of this year (September to December), and will reach eight million by mid-1950. The hardest hit are the industrialized states of California, Pennsylvania, Massachusetts, Illinois, Ohio, Michigan, New Jersey, and New York. TASS estimates that the number of unemployed in New York State alone may be close to 750,000. The Public Affairs Institute also pointed out that even those who have work are experiencing a continued decline in living conditions, with reduced working hours and wages. According to statistics from the US Bureau of Labor Statistics cited in a TASS dispatch on the 19th, industrial workers' wages have fallen by 10 percent compared to November of last year, and farmers' incomes have also decreased. The current annual national income is only $214 billion, $6 billion less than last year. According to statistics from the Federal Statistics Bureau, the number of bankruptcies has doubled compared to last year, with an average of 200 bankruptcies occurring each week.

A United Press International dispatch on the 18th quoted Graham, research director of the Commercial Association, as saying that last year's US exports fell by an average of 15.1 percent in quantity and dollar value. Last year, US port exports (excluding labor services) totaled only $887,720,000, compared to $1,102,630,000 in 1947.

Xinhua News Agency, Beiping, 21st. TASS, Tel Aviv: Local newspapers have confirmed that American capital is continuing to infiltrate Israel. The Palestine Post reported that an economic delegation from the "Israel Industrial Association," established by American industrial and financial giants, has arrived in Israel to discuss investment in Israeli industry. According to the newspaper, the so-called "Israel Industrial Association" was founded by Thorup, Assistant Secretary of State for Economic Affairs in the US State Department, and representatives of major companies.

    年底失业估计将达六百万破产事件平均每周二百起
    【新华社北平二十一日电】“美国经济危机已发展到再也不能用一些令人安心的话来含混过去了”，这是最近美国资产阶级的报纸——纽约邮报评论家柏特尔对日益严重的美国经济情势所作的评语。据美国联邦准备局透露，美国的生产指数，已自去年十月的一九五（以一九三五——三九年为一百）的最高峰，跌至今年五月的一七五，即连续下跌了二十点。同时，失业也从去年十月开始不断增加，据合众社十八日电引公共事务研究所报告，目前还看不出失业有停止的趋势，并估计失业人数今年最后一季（即九月至十二月）将增至六百万人，而到一九五○年年中则将达八百万之数。目前受打击最重的是工业发达的加利福尼亚、宾夕法尼亚、麻萨克斯、伊利诺斯、俄亥俄、密执安、新泽西和纽约等州。塔斯社估计目前仅纽约一州的失业人数可能接近七十五万人。公共事务研究所并指出，就是有工可做的人，生活条件也在继续降底，受雇的时间和工资也在下降。据塔斯社十九日电引美国劳工统计局统计，产业工人工资比去年十一月跌落了百分之十，农民的所得亦已减少。目前的全年国民收入已仅二千一百四十亿美元，即较去年少了六十亿。根据联邦统计局的统计，破产数目已达去年的两倍，现在平均每周发生破产事件二百起。
    合众社十八日电引商业协会研究主任格拉翰的话说，美国去年的输出在数量和美元价值上平均下跌了百分之十五点一，即去年美国各港口的输出（按劳务不计在内）仅八十八万七千七百二十万美元，而一九四七年则为一百一十万二千六百三十万美元。
    【新华社北平二十一日电】塔斯社特拉维夫讯：此间报纸顷证实美国资本正继续渗入以色列，巴勒斯坦邮报载称，美国工业与金融巨头所建立的“以色列工业协会”的经济代表团，已抵以色列，该团将讨论在以色列工业中进行投资的问题。据该报称，所谓“以色列工业协会”，是由美国国务院专管经济问题的助理国务卿索普及各大公司的代表创办的。
