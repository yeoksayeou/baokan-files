Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, June 11th: The Shanghai Military Control Commission's Finance and Economics Takeover Committee's Heavy Industry Division began taking over the Kuomintang government and bureaucrat-capital heavy industrial enterprises in Shanghai on May 30th, and this phase concluded on June 5th. Currently, each enterprise is conducting inventory and handover procedures, and planning for resumption of production. Among the units taken over that belonged to the Kuomintang government's National Resources Commission are the Commission headquarters and its affiliated Central Electrical Equipment Factory Shanghai Plant, Central Machinery Company Shanghai Plant, Universal Machinery Company Manufacturing Plant, Central Chemical Factory Shanghai Plant, Central Radio Company Manufacturing Plant, Shenyang Locomotive and Rolling Stock Company, Shanghai Wheel Factory, and twelve management organizations and material warehouses for petroleum, steel, mining equipment, etc., and sixteen business organizations. Those belonging to the bogus Post-War Relief and Rehabilitation Administration include the Administration headquarters and its affiliated China Agricultural Machinery Company Shanghai Plant, Wusong Plant, Rural Industry Demonstration Center, Water Transport Brigade, Ship Repair Yard, and five large material warehouses for vehicles, mining equipment, etc., and more than ten small and medium-sized warehouses. There are also the Jiangnan Shipyard and Xie Xing Machinery Factory. For some bureaucrat-capital enterprises like Shanghai Steel Plant, Tianyuan Electrochemical Plant, Tianli Nitrogen Plant, and Yaohua Glass Factory, the Military Control Commission has taken over the bureaucrat-capital portion and will continue joint operations with private capital.

Most of the aforementioned units taken over were relief supplies and property of Japanese and puppet regimes that were seized by the Kuomintang reactionary government after the victory against Japan. They possessed the most advanced machinery and the strongest material resources in the country, serving as important economic pillars for bureaucrat-capital's monopoly and plunder in the past three or four years. At the same time, these assets were stolen, dismantled, and transported away by Kuomintang bandit chiefs, resulting in severe damage. For example, the Xie Xing Machinery Factory, which was plundered by the war criminal Tang Enbo, originally had more than 200 machine tools, but now only has about 70 left. The Zhenru Mining Equipment Warehouse was never properly inventoried or inspected and maintained, and was left to the elements, causing many drugs and chemical industrial raw materials among the more than 4,000 tons of materials in the warehouse to oxidize, rot, and deteriorate, rendering them unusable. After the Central Chemical Factory was taken over by the Kuomintang government's Ministry of Economic Affairs, two-thirds of its equipment was sold off. Before the liberation of Shanghai, the Kuomintang bandit troops also carried out large-scale looting and destruction of these industrial and mining enterprises. In addition to the Jiangnan Shipyard, which had already been severely damaged by the bandit troops, the bandits also planned to dismantle or destroy other factories. Fortunately, the People's Liberation Army advanced swiftly, and the factory workers heroically protected the factories, thwarting the bandits' conspiracy. However, many warehouses were looted by the bandit troops, and important equipment was lost.

After the liberation of Shanghai, the Military Control Commission carried out the takeover of the above-mentioned enterprises according to the principle of "from top to bottom, keeping everything intact." Most of the responsible personnel of each unit also remained in their original positions to handle the handover. Workers and many experts from each factory organized and assisted the takeover teams, actively assisting the Military Control Commission in the takeover work from both technical and labor perspectives.

　　沪接管重工业
  　电工器材厂等筹备复工
    【新华社上海十一日电】上海市军管会财经接管委员会重工业处对上海国民党政府及官僚资本各重工业企业部门的接管工作，于上月三十日开始，至本月五日已告一段落。现各企业部门正进行清点移交，并筹划复工生产，在被接管的单位中，属于国民党政府资源委员会者有该会本部及其所属的中央电工器材厂上海厂、中央机器公司上海厂、通用机器公司制造厂、中央化工厂上海厂、中央无线电公司制造厂、沈阳机车车辆公司、上海车轮厂及石油钢铁工矿器材等管理机构与物资仓库十二个单位，业务机构十六个单位；属于伪善后事业保管委员会者有该会本部及其所属的中国农业机械公司上海厂、吴淞厂、乡村工业示范处、水运大队、船舶修理厂及车辆工矿等器材大仓库五处，中小仓库十余处。另有江南造船所与协兴机器厂两单位。有部分官僚资本的上海钢铁厂、天原电化厂、天利氮气厂、耀华玻璃厂等，则由军管会接管其属于官僚资本部分，继续与私人资本合营。上述各被接收单位多系抗战胜利后国民党反动政府霸吞之救济物资与日伪财产，拥有全国最新式机器及最雄厚的物资实力，为三四年来官僚资本进行垄断、掠夺的重要经济凭借。同时，这些资产，又被国民党匪首们盗卖拆运，损耗极重。如被战犯汤恩伯劫收的协兴机器厂，原有工作母机二百余部，现在只剩下七十余部。真茹工矿器材库从来没有点清，也从未加以检查保养，一任风雨剥蚀，使该库四千多吨物资中的很多药物与化学工业原料，已氧化腐朽变质，不能再用。中央化工厂为国民党政府经济部接收后，器材被变卖三分之二。上海解放之前，国民党匪军又对这些工矿企业大肆劫运与破坏，除江南造船所已被匪军严重破坏外，对其他各厂，匪徒们亦准备拆运或破坏，幸因解放军进军神速，各厂职工英勇护厂，匪徒阴谋始未得逞。但许多仓库均遭匪军抢劫，重要器材损失很多。上海解放后，军管会对上述企业按自上而下、原封不动原则进行接收；各该单位主管人员亦大部各守原职，办理移交；各厂职工及许多专家并组织协助接管小组，从技术到劳动各方面积极协助军管会进行接管工作。
