Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, June 22nd: The Hong Kong British government’s autocratic policies of infringing upon the rights of the Chinese people in Hong Kong are causing increasing serious concern here. The first notable action of the Hong Kong government after the promulgation of the "Societies Registration Ordinance" was the search of the residence of renowned Chinese Communist Fang Fang by the Hong Kong Special Affairs Department at 6:00 AM on the 13th. The search of Fang Fang's residence yielded nothing, which the Hong Kong government was naturally fully aware of beforehand, because the Chinese Communists in Hong Kong, like other Chinese democrats in Hong Kong, have never intended to create any "atrocities" in Hong Kong. This fabricated shadow is merely an excuse for the Hong Kong government to cover up its true atrocities of trampling on human rights. In the past six months, the Hong Kong government has continuously attacked the freedoms and rights of the Chinese people in Hong Kong (who account for 99% of Hong Kong residents). The closure of Dat Tat College in late February and the promulgation of the "Societies Registration Ordinance" on May 25th have aroused widespread indignation among the Chinese people. The incident of searching Fang Fang's residence on June 13th seems to foreshadow that the Hong Kong government's attacks on the freedoms and rights of Chinese Communists and other Chinese residents in Hong Kong will intensify in the future. This situation cannot but make the Chinese people ask: What is the purpose of the British authorities in turning Hong Kong into a world of terror?

    香港英政府摧残人权
    无理搜查中共党员住宅
    中国人民已严重关切英政府的专横政策
    【新华社北平二十二日电】香港英政府对于侵夺香港中国人民权利的专横政策，日益引起此间的严重关切。香港政府在颁布“社团注册条例”以后的第一件令人注目的举动，就是香港特务部在十三日晨六时搜查著名中国共产党人方方的住宅。搜查方方住宅的结果毫无所获，这当然是香港政府在事先即已完全了解的，因为香港的中国共产党人和其他在香港的中国民主人士一样，从来没打算在香港制造什么“暴行”，这种捏造的黑影不过是香港政府用来掩饰自己摧残人权的真正暴行的借口而已。香港政府最近半年来已经不断向香港中国人民（占香港居民百分之九十九）的自由权利进攻，其二月下旬查封达德学院和五月二十五日颁布“社团注册条例”两事，曾引起中国人民的广泛愤慨。六月十三日搜查方方住宅的事件，似乎是预告着，今后香港政府对于香港中国共产党人和其他中国居民自由权利的进攻将要变本加厉。这种情况不能不使中国人民发问：英国当局把香港造成恐怖世界的目的何在？
