    North China Beiping Transportation Company Freight Transfer Station Opens Today
    [Report from this newspaper] In order to develop transportation business and facilitate customers' consignment of goods, the North China Beiping Transportation Company has established a freight transfer station, which will officially open for business today (the 25th) at 45 Hufangqiao. The business scope of the transfer station includes freight forwarding, buying and selling on behalf of customers, and handling railway transportation (the station also engages in its own buying and selling to avoid empty return trips). Consignors who consign goods to the freight station must provide a pre-registered seal, and the freight station will issue a warehouse receipt. Consigned items can be picked up at any time with the warehouse receipt and seal. Warehouse rent is calculated on a monthly basis (from the date of consignment to the date of removal from the warehouse). A full month is calculated as a full month, and if it exceeds one month but is less than two months, the excess portion is calculated on a daily basis. To facilitate consignors, the freight station also handles customs declaration, tax payment, and agency insurance services. (Cheng Jie)
