　　The Youth Movement in the Chinese People's Liberation War and the Basic Tasks of Chinese Youth in the Future
    -- Report by Liao Chengzhi at the First National Congress of the Chinese Youth on May 5th

    As the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang has been declared dead, the people's democratic revolution has achieved a decisive victory across the country, and on the 30th anniversary of the May Fourth Movement and the first May Fourth commemoration since the liberation of Beiping, our First National Congress of the Chinese Youth is opening in Beiping.

    The representatives attending this conference include youth and youth workers from various regions, occupations, ethnic groups, classes, parties, political beliefs, and religious beliefs across the country. This is a democratic great unity of the national youth. It is the first time in China to convene a national youth conference with such broad representation. Its realization should be attributed to the great victory of the Chinese People's Liberation War.

    The victory of the Chinese People's Liberation War has changed the face of the whole of China, and also changed the face of the lives of Chinese youth. Chinese youth can be comforted that in the victorious advance of the Chinese People's Revolutionary Movement, Chinese youth have maintained and carried forward the glorious revolutionary tradition of Chinese youth since the May Fourth Movement, and have heroically and actively participated in this great liberation struggle, and have become an important aspect army in the Chinese revolutionary army.

    Young soldiers in the People's Liberation Army account for about 70 to 80 percent of the entire People's Liberation Army. They have created thousands of model shooters, model gunners, tank drivers, explosion heroes, and combat heroes in battle. They are often the most active members in various military, political and technical studies, in the democratic life and cultural and recreational activities of the troops, and in various other constructive movements.

    The young peasants in the liberated areas are an important force in agricultural production. They actively participated in the great land reform movement in the liberated areas. The outstanding members among them have become cadres of the district and village people's governments, and are the main source of the People's Liberation Army, as well as the main force of the militia, self-defense forces and civilian workers supporting the front.

    The number of young workers accounts for a large proportion of the total number of workers, and plays a significant role in China's production front and political life. They have made very important contributions to the Chinese People's Liberation War in the supply of large-scale liberation wars and the needs of the broad masses of the people. Young workers and staff in the Kuomintang-controlled areas carried out heroic struggles under the bloody suppression of the Kuomintang reactionaries.

    The Chinese student movement has a glorious historical tradition. The patriotic student movement, which carried out heroic struggles under the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang, won the sympathy and respect of the people throughout the country. In the liberated areas, students, whose situation was the opposite of those in the Kuomintang-controlled areas, lived and studied in a completely free and progressive political environment, and a large number of revolutionary cadres who wholeheartedly served the people emerged among them.

    In addition to the heroic struggles of the aforementioned young workers, peasants, soldiers and students, there are also patriotic youth and youth workers from other broad strata such as the cultural circles, education circles, and the self-employed, who, under the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang, in various work positions and in various ways, carried out solemn work against national betrayal, dictatorship, and civil war, and in support of independence, democracy, and peace, and directly or indirectly cooperated with the victorious advance of the People's Liberation War.

    It can be seen that in the past Chinese people's revolutionary movement, Chinese youth worked hard to complete their tasks. Now that the Chinese people's democratic revolution is approaching its final completion, and the great construction cause of the new China is beginning, it is hoped that the national youth will carry forward the tradition of heroic sacrifice and hard struggle in the past, to carry out the following three basic tasks:

　　1. Support the complete completion of the people's democratic revolution and support the new people's democratic state.

    Now the reactionary rule of the Nanjing Kuomintang has collapsed, but there are still remnant forces that need to be wiped out. These reactionary remnants, with the support of US imperialism, still attempt to make a comeback and continue to harm the people. Chinese youth should be with the Chinese people, actively support the correct policy of the Chinese Communist Party and various democratic parties to carry the revolution through to the end, continue to actively participate in and support the Chinese People's Liberation Army in eliminating the remaining enemies, and liberate all the territory of China, so that all the people and youth throughout the country can be liberated from the rule of the Kuomintang reactionaries without exception.

    In order to complete this task, the youth in the liberated areas need to participate in and support the southward People's Liberation Army in large numbers, and actively participate in and assist the takeover work in the new areas. The youth who are still under the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang should actively unite the masses, strive to protect economic and cultural institutions and all property from being destroyed, and prepare to welcome the arrival of the People's Liberation Army.

    On the one hand, Chinese youth need to actively participate in the struggle to eliminate the remnants of the reactionaries, and on the other hand, they need to actively participate in the cause of building a new China. In order to build a new China, a new patriotism should be universally promoted among young people. The great people's democratic new China, born in the flames of the Liberation War, was created by the Chinese people's more than 100 years of hard struggle and the heroic bloodshed of countless revolutionary martyrs. Our country has 475 million people and 9.6 million square kilometers of land, and has a civilization history of four thousand years. It has now been freed from the shackles of imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism, and has achieved national independence and people's democracy, guaranteeing the increasing improvement of social productive forces and the more happy future of the younger generation, and thus becoming one of the few most progressive countries in the world. Chinese youth must love this lovely motherland with infinite loyalty, actively dedicate themselves to the economic, political, military, and cultural construction of our country, actively strengthen and improve the rights and status of our people, consolidate our national defense, ensure the sacred inviolability of our country's territory, sovereignty, interests, and honor, cherish all public wealth of our country, respect and abide by the revolutionary order and legal system formulated by the People's Government, and wage a resolute struggle against all enemies that endanger our country's survival and interests, in order to guarantee the prosperity of our country's construction cause.

    This patriotism of Chinese youth is consistent with the internationalism of progressive mankind, and is incompatible with national aggressionism and xenophobia. We firmly believe that all nations should have equal rights to independence and freedom, and the people of all countries should respect and unite with each other, and oppose national aggression, oppression, and discrimination. Therefore, we not only care about the fate of our own motherland, but also care about the revolutionary movements of all oppressed nations to strive for liberation, and care about the peace and democracy movements of the people of all countries in the world. We Chinese youth must actively participate in the common struggle of world youth and the people of the world against new war conspiracies, against national aggression, and against anti-democratic politics.

　　2. Strengthen production and construction work

    As the People's Liberation War is about to achieve a nationwide victory, the restoration and development of industrial and agricultural production is increasingly becoming an important task for the Chinese people and Chinese youth. Chinese youth bear a serious responsibility in the great work of restoring and developing production, just as they bore a serious responsibility in the revolutionary war in the past.

    All young workers, staff, and technicians who participate in state-owned industries or other production undertakings must establish a correct labor attitude, strengthen labor discipline, improve production technology and production management, and give full play to the initiative and creativity of young people in production, in order to achieve the goal of continuously improving production efficiency, improving product quality, reducing production costs, and accelerating product circulation. Young people working in private industries or other private production undertakings that are beneficial to the people's livelihood should also actively increase production on the condition that their legitimate rights are guaranteed.

    Young people engaged in agricultural labor should promote labor mutual aid organizations based on the principles of voluntariness and mutual benefit, develop supply and marketing cooperatives, improve farming methods, and strive to increase the production of grain, cotton, and other agricultural products. In areas where land reform has not been completed, they should also actively participate in the struggle for land reform under the leadership of the People's Government.

    In short, young people must adopt a positive attitude in whatever production position they are in, and strive in the direction that is conducive to the restoration and development of production. Young people should promote the style of hard struggle, diligence and thrift, and tighten their belts to accumulate the capital necessary for economic construction.

　　3. Study New Democracy, study science and culture

    The basic task of youth is to study. All patriotic youth in China, today are in the era of the victory of the people's democratic revolution in the whole of China, and in the era when the people of the whole of China are beginning to restore and develop industrial and agricultural production on a large scale. In order to adapt to the needs of the times, they must study hard. First, they must study New Democracy, the founding principle of our new China, and study science and culture.

    All patriotic youth in China should study New Democracy, because this is the founding principle of our new China. All patriotic youth in China should strive to study Mao Zedong, the creator and leader of the new China, study Mao Zedong's principle of loyalty to the interests of the country, the nation, and the people, study Mao Zedong's revolutionary spirit of hard struggle and serving the people, and study Mao Zedong's scientific spirit of seeking truth from facts.

    In the issue of learning, in the issue of thought, we should establish the same united front as in politics, that is, the united front against imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism, that is, the united front under the common program of New Democracy.

    In addition to studying politics, Chinese youth must have a certain cultural level, have the necessary production knowledge, and must strive to study modern scientific knowledge in order to build a prosperous and strong new China, so that this scientific knowledge serves China's production and construction, in order to cultivate themselves into various specialists needed for construction work.

    Due to the underdeveloped culture and education in old China in the past, in order to improve the cultural level of young people throughout the country, we must first widely launch a popular education movement for young people, strive to eliminate illiteracy within a certain period of time, and universally improve the cultural level of young people. We should give the greatest respect and help to the hard work of the vast number of rural primary school teachers who bury themselves in hard work in remote areas and cultivate the descendants of the nation.

    Comrades, in order to realize the above tasks and build a new democratic China, the national youth must unite as one and strive forward under the banner of Mao Zedong.

    Without the united unity of the national youth under the common program of opposing imperialism, opposing feudalism, and opposing bureaucratic capitalism, regardless of occupation, party affiliation, ethnicity, political belief, or religious belief, the strength of Chinese youth will be dispersed and weakened. Without the correct leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, Chinese youth may lose their way on the road to progress.

    In our current representative conference, the All-China Federation of Democratic Youth has been formally established, which is exactly the national youth organization that we all hoped for to concretely realize the great democratic unity of the national youth. We believe that it will be able to widely unite the youth of all of China and all democratic youth in the world, and make the greatest contribution to the construction of China's New Democracy and to the world's peace and democracy movement.

　　中国人民解放战争中的青年运动与今后中国青年的基本任务     
    ——廖承志五月五日在中华全国青年第一次代表大会上的报告
    在国民党反动统治已经宣告灭亡，人民民主革命已在全国取得决定性胜利，在五四运动的三十周年和北平解放以后的第一次五四纪念的时候，我们中华全国青年第一次代表大会，在北平开幕了。
    这次出席大会的代表，包括着全国各个不同地区、不同职业、不同民族、不同阶级、不同党派、不同政治信仰、不同宗教信仰的青年及青年工作者，这是全国青年的民主大团结。召开具有这样广泛代表性的全国青年的大会，在中国还是第一次。这是中国青年久已盼待的集会，它的实现应当归功于中国人民解放战争的伟大胜利。
    中国人民解放战争的胜利改变了全中国的面貌，也改变了中国青年生活的面貌。中国青年可以自慰的是：在中国人民革命运动的胜利进军中，中国青年保持并发扬了五四以来中国青年的光荣革命传统，英勇积极地参加了这一伟大的解放斗争，并且成为中国革命大军中底一个重要方面军。
    人民解放军中的青年战士，约占全体解放军的百分之七十到八十。他们在战斗中创造了成千成万的模范射击手，模范炮手，坦克手，爆炸英雄，战斗英雄。他们在各种军事、政治与技术学习上，在部队的民主生活和文化娱乐活动及其他各种建设性的运动中，经常是最活动的分子。
    解放区的青年农民是农业生产的重要力量。他们积极地参加了解放区伟大的土地改革运动。他们中间的优秀分子，已成为区村人民政权的干部，而且是人民解放军的主要来源，和民兵、自卫队和支援前线的民工的主力。
    青年工人的数量，在全体工人中占有很大的比重，在中国生产战线和政治生活中起着重大的作用。他们在大规模解放战争的供给和广大人民的需要上，对于中国人民解放战争作了很重要的贡献。国民党统治区的青年职工，在国民党反动派的血腥镇压下进行了英勇的斗争。
    中国学生运动有光荣的历史传统。在国民党反动统治下进行着英勇斗争的学生爱国运动，获得了全国人民的同情和尊敬。而在解放区，和国民党统治区学生处境相反的学生们，是生活和学习在完全自由和进步的政治环境中，在他们中间产生了大量的全心全意为人民服务的革命干部。
    除了上述年青的工人、农民、士兵和学生的英勇奋斗以外，还有文化界、教育界、自由职业者等其他广大阶层的爱国青年及青年工作者，在国民党反动统治底下，在各种不同的工作岗位上，以各种不同的方式，进行了反对卖国、独裁、内战，拥护独立、民主、和平的庄严工作，直接或间接地配合了人民解放战争的胜利进军。
    由此可见，在过去的中国人民革命运动中，中国青年是努力地完成了自己的任务的。现在中国人民民主革命正在接近于最后的完成，新中国的伟大建设事业正在开始，希望全国青年发扬过去的英勇牺牲艰苦奋斗的传统，来执行以下三项基本任务：
  　一、拥护人民民主革命的彻底完成，拥护人民民主的新国家。
    现在南京国民党的反动统治已经土崩瓦解，但是还有残余势力需要肃清，这些反动残余在美帝国主义的支持之下，还企图死灰复燃，继续祸害人民。中国青年应当和中国人民在一起，积极拥护中国共产党和中国各民主党派把革命进行到底的正确方针，继续积极参加和支援中国人民解放军消灭残余敌人，解放中国的全部国土，使全国人民和青年无例外地都能从国民党反动派的统治下面解放出来。
    为了完成这一任务，解放区的青年需要大量参加和支援南下的人民解放军，并积极参加和协助新区接管工作。暂时还在国民党反动统治下的青年，则须积极团结群众，努力保护经济文化机关及一切资财勿受破坏，准备迎接解放军的到来。
    中国青年一方面需要积极参加消灭反动派残余的斗争，另一方面需要积极参加建设新中国的事业。为了建设新中国，应当在青年中间普遍地提倡新的爱国主义。在解放战争的烽火中诞生的伟大的人民民主的新中国，是中国人民一百多年的艰苦奋斗和无数革命先烈的英勇流血造成的。我们的国家有四万万七千五百万人口，九百六十万方公里土地，有四千年的文明历史，它现在已经摆脱了帝国主义、封建主义、官僚资本主义的束缚，实现了民族的独立和人民的民主，保证了社会生产力的日益提高和青年后代更幸福的将来，因而成为世界上少数最进步的国家之一。中国青年必须以无限忠诚，热爱这个可爱的祖国，积极献身于我国的经济、政治、军事、文化的建设，积极加强和改善我国人民的权利和地位、巩固我国的国防，保证我国的领土、主权、利益、荣誉的神圣不可侵犯，爱护我们国家的一切公共财富，尊重和遵守人民政府所制定的革命秩序和法律制度，向危害我们国家的生存和利益的一切敌人作坚决的斗争，借以保障我们国家的建设事业的蒸蒸日上。
    中国青年的这种爱国主义，是与进步人类的国际主义相一致，而与民族侵略主义和排外主义不相容的。我们深信一切民族都应有独立自由的平等权利，各国人民都应当互相尊重，互相团结，反对民族间的侵略、压迫和歧视。因此，我们不但关心自己祖国的命运，而且关心一切被压迫民族争取解放的革命运动，关心全世界各国人民的和平民主运动。我们中国青年要积极参加世界青年和世界人民反对新战争阴谋、反对民族侵略、反对反民主政治的共同斗争。
　　二、加强生产建设工作
    在人民解放战争即将取得全国胜利之际，恢复和发展工农业生产日益成为中国人民和中国青年的重要任务。中国青年在恢复和发展生产的伟大工作当中负有严重的责任，正象过去在革命战争中负有严重的责任一样。
    一切参加国营工业或其他生产事业的青年工人、职员和技术人员都要树立正确的劳动态度，加强劳动纪律，改进生产技术和生产管理，充分发挥青年在生产中的积极性和创造性，以便达到不断提高生产效率、改进产品质量、减低生产成本、加速产品流通之目的。在有益国民生计的私营工业或其他私营生产事业中劳动的青年，也要在自己的正当权利获得保障的条件之下，积极增进生产。
    从事农业劳动的青年，要提倡根据自愿两利原则的劳动互助组织，发展供销合作社，改进农作法，努力增产粮食、棉花和其他农产品。而在没有完成土地改革的地方，还要在人民政府领导之下，积极参加土地改革的斗争。
    总之，青年无论在什么生产岗位上都要采取积极态度，向着有利于恢复和发展生产的方向努力。青年应当提倡艰苦奋斗、勤俭朴素的作风，节衣缩食，以便积累经济建设的所必须的资本。
　　三、学习新民主主义、学习科学和文化
    青年的基本任务是学习。中国的一切爱国青年，今天处在全中国人民民主革命胜利的时代，处在全中国人民着手大规模地恢复和发展工农业生产的时代，为了适应时代的需要，必须努力学习。首先是学习我们新中国立国原理的新民主主义，学习科学和文化。
    中国一切爱国青年都应当学习新民主主义，因为这是我们新中国的立国原理。中国的一切爱国青年都应当努力学习新中国的创造者和领袖毛泽东，学习毛泽东的忠于国家民族和人民利益的原则精神，学习毛泽东的艰苦奋斗为人民服务的革命精神，学习毛泽东的实事求是的科学精神。
    我们在学习问题上，在思想的问题上，应当建立和在政治上同样的统一战线，就是反对帝国主义、封建主义和官僚资本主义的统一战线，就是在新民主主义的共同纲领下的统一战线。
    中国青年除了学习政治以外，为了建设繁荣的富强的新中国，必须具有一定的文化水平，具有必要的生产知识，并且必须努力钻研现代的科学知识，使这种科学知识服务于中国的生产建设，以便培养自己成为建设工作所需要的各种专门家。
    由于过去旧中国的文化教育不发达，提高全国青年的文化水平，首先必须广泛展开青年的普及教育运动，争取在一定时期内消灭文盲，普遍地提高青年的文化程度。对于那些在穷乡僻壤埋头苦干、培育国民后代的广大农村小学教师底艰苦工作，我们更应给以最大的尊重和帮助。
    同志们，为了实现上述任务，建设新民主主义中国，全国青年必须一致团结起来，在毛泽东的旗帜下奋斗前进。
    如果没有全国青年在反对帝国主义、反对封建主义、反对官僚资本主义的共同纲领下不分职业、不分党派、不分民族、不分政治信仰、不分宗教信仰的一致团结，那么中国青年的力量就将受到分散和削弱。如果没有中国共产党毛主席底正确领导，那么中国青年就可能在前进的路途中迷失方向。
    在我们这次代表大会中，已正式成立中华全国民主青年联合总会，这正是我们大家所希望的具体实现了全国青年民主大团结的一个全国性的青年组织。我们相信：它将能够广泛团结全中国青年和全世界的一切民主青年，为中国新民主主义的建设、为全世界的和平民主运动竭尽最大的贡献。【新华社北平五日电】
