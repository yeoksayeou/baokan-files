Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 1st: According to a TASS dispatch from Paris: On May 30th, the Council of Foreign Ministers held the first meeting of its second week, chaired by Vyshinsky, to continue discussing the issue of German unification.

　　Vyshinsky spoke first, refuting the proposals on German unification put forward by the US, UK, and French foreign ministers at the previous meeting, and stated that these proposals were unacceptable because they contradicted the Potsdam Agreement. (See separate dispatch for details.)

　　The speeches by Acheson, Schuman, and Bevin attempted in every way to embellish their proposals and presented a biased account of the Soviet delegation's position. Acheson distorted the substance of the Soviet proposals, saying that they left the Germans no freedom of action. Acheson again raised some economic issues, which, as Vyshinsky had already demonstrated, were unrelated to the issue of German unification currently under discussion by the Council of Foreign Ministers. Acheson failed to refute Vyshinsky's statement that the Western countries' proposal to extend the occupation statutes to all of Germany, in effect, amounted to abandoning the conclusion of a peace treaty with Germany and indefinitely prolonging the period of occupation.

　　Schuman's speech tried hard to prove that the divisive activities carried out by the US, UK, and France in West Germany were legitimate. Schuman insisted that the three Western countries' proposals conformed to the principles of the Potsdam Agreement, insisting that the latter stipulated a federal structure for Germany.

　　Bevin's speech enthusiastically praised the occupation statutes and the so-called Bonn Constitution, insisting that the constitution laid the "foundation for enabling the German people to establish a German People's Republic." Bevin asked whether the details of the US, UK, and French delegations' proposals could be put aside and an agreement reached on the "main aspects." He suggested using the US, UK, and French proposals as a basis for discussion, point by point.

　　Vyshinsky spoke again, replying to Bevin's suggestion to disregard the details of the three countries' proposals and reach an agreement on the main aspects, saying that our differences were not in the details, but in the main aspects. Vyshinsky continued: People tell us that since the last London Foreign Ministers' Conference eighteen months ago, many changes have taken place, and these changes must be taken into account. But in what aspect should we take these changes into account? Of course, many changes have taken place in these eighteen months. However, the principles of the Potsdam Agreement remain unchanged. Vyshinsky reminded the meeting: Schuman, today, as in previous meetings, insisted that the Potsdam Agreement stipulated a federal structure for Germany. Vyshinsky said: This is a mistake; not a single word, not a single letter can be found in the Potsdam Agreement to confirm Schuman's theory. What was discussed in Potsdam was not the federalization of Germany, but the liquidation of Hitler's centralism. Schuman believes that there is a contradiction between advocating the liquidation of Hitler's centralism and opposing federalization. But in reality, there is no contradiction here. Hitler's centralism is one thing, and the state system established on the basis of the Weimar Constitution is another. There is no contradiction between the position of the Warsaw Conference of Eastern European Foreign Ministers in June 1948 and the position that the Soviet Union has adhered to in the past and now. Vyshinsky also said: As far back as the Moscow Foreign Ministers' Conference in 1947, the US and UK delegations defended the principle that "all power must belong to the state parliaments." On this issue, Molotov said at the Moscow Foreign Ministers' Conference: "The suggestion that all power must belong to the state parliaments despises the power of the German government, especially its economic power. They strengthen state power by reducing the power of the German government, reducing the power of the German government to such an extent that it tends to split Germany into pieces, and this split means the end of the German state." It was at that time that the Soviet delegation opposed the US and UK positions with a different position. The Soviet Union then stated that the issue of the relationship between the German central government and the state governments could be appropriately resolved on the basis of the Weimar Constitution (despite all its shortcomings). The Soviet delegation suggested making such amendments to the constitution that could eliminate its negative and undemocratic aspects. Vyshinsky concluded by saying that therefore, the main differences regarding the issues under discussion were not in the details, but in the main aspects. This makes the proposals that the US, UK, and French delegations have given us to consider unacceptable.

### 苏外长坚持波茨坦协议　驳斥美英法建议　指责三国蓄意分裂德国阴谋

　　苏外长坚持波茨坦协议
  　驳斥美英法建议
  　指责三国蓄意分裂德国阴谋
    【新华社北平一日电】据塔斯社巴黎讯：五月三十日，四国外长举行第二周的第一次会议，由维辛斯基任主席，继续讨论德国统一问题。
    维辛斯基首先发言，驳斥美英法外长在上次会议上提出的关于德国统一问题的建议，并表明这些建议是无法接受的，因为它与波茨坦协议矛盾。（详见另电）
    艾奇逊、舒曼和贝文的发言，试图以一切方法为他们的建议粉饰，并偏颇地表述苏联代表团的立场。艾奇逊歪曲苏联建议的实质，说什么这一建议使德国人没有一点活动的自由。艾奇逊再度提出一些经济问题，如维辛斯基所已证明者。这些问题是与外长会议目前讨论中的德国统一问题无关的。艾奇逊未能驳倒维辛斯基的发言，即西方国家把占领法规扩大到全德国的建议，事实上就等于废弃与德国缔结和约和无限期地延长占领时期。
    舒曼的发言硬想证明美英法在西德实施的分裂活动是合法的。舒曼坚持三西方国家的建议符合于波茨坦协议的原则，硬说后者规定了德国的联邦结构。
    贝文的发言热烈颂扬占领法规及所谓波恩宪法，硬说该宪法打下了“使德国人民得能建立德国人民共和国的基础。”贝文提出是否能丢开美英法代表团建议的细节，而在“主要方面”达到协议。他建议以美英法建议为基础，逐条予以讨论。
    再次维辛斯基发言，他答复贝文的不管三国建议的细节，而在主要方面达到协议的建议称，我们的分歧不是在细节方面，而是在主要方面。维辛斯基继称：人家告诉我们说，自上次伦敦外长会议后十八个月以来，已经有了很多改变，必须要把这些改变计算在内。但是，在那一方面我们应该把这些改变计算在内呢？当然，在这十八个月中，有了很多改变。但是，波茨坦协议的原则仍然是没有改变的。维辛斯基提醒会议：舒曼今天也象上几次会议那样，硬说波茨坦协议规定了德国的联邦结构。维辛斯基说：这是一个错误，在波茨坦协议中，找不到一个字、一个字母证实舒曼的理论。波茨坦所讨论的，不是德国的联邦化，而是清算希特勒式的中央集权。舒曼认为，在主张清算希特勒式中央集权和反对联邦化的立场中间有矛盾。但是，实际上，这里是没有矛盾的。希特勒式的中央集权是一种东西，以魏玛宪法为基础而建立的国家制度是另一种东西。在一九四八年六月华沙东欧国家外长会议的立场与苏联过去和现在所坚持的立场中间并没有任何矛盾。维辛斯基又称：远在一九四七年莫斯科外长会议时，美英代表团就为“一切权力必须属于州议会”的原则辩护。关于这个问题，莫洛托夫曾在莫斯科外长会议上说：“一切权力必须属于州议会的建议，藐视了德国政府的权力，特别是该政府在经济方面的权力。他们以削减全德政府的权力来加强州权，削减全德政府的权力到了这样程度，以致成了把德国分裂成一块块的倾向，而这种分裂就意味着德国国家的完结”。就是在那时，苏联代表团就以另一种立场反对美英的立场，苏联那时声明：德国中央政府与州政府之间的关系问题，可以以魏玛宪法（尽管它有一切缺点）为基础而加以适当的解决。苏联代表团建议对该宪法作这样的一种修正，这种修改能消除该宪法之消极与非民主的一面。维辛斯基末称，因此，对于讨论中的问题的主要分歧，不是在细节方面，而是在主要方面。这就使美英法代表团提给我们考虑的建议无法接受。
