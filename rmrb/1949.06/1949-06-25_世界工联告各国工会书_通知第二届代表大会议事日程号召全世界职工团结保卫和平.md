Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 24th: TASS, Paris - The World Federation of Trade Unions (WFTU) issued a letter on the 20th to all national trade union central organizations, industrial union federations, and working men and women around the world, stating: The Second Congress of the WFTU will be held on June 29th this year in Milan, Italy.

The WFTU invites representatives from all genuine trade union organizations to attend the Congress. If a national trade union central organization, trade union federation, or individual trade union, for some reason or other cannot send their official representatives to the Congress, the WFTU will sincerely invite them to send observers to participate in the Congress.

The Second Congress of the WFTU will symbolize the unity of working people belonging to trade unions, regardless of race, nationality, political or religious beliefs.

The Congress will discuss and adopt resolutions on major issues concerning the world trade union movement. The agenda includes: a report on the activities of the WFTU and reports on actions taken by the WFTU and its affiliated national central organizations to defend the economic and social interests of working people; the establishment of industrial departments within the WFTU; the WFTU's activities to defend peace and the democratic rights of the people; reports on the activities of trade unions in Asian and African countries, Australia, and Latin America; a report on the issue of equal economic and social rights for relocated and immigrant working people.

The Congress will democratically elect the leading bodies of the WFTU.

At a time when there is a real danger of a new war and economic crisis, the unity of working people is more necessary than ever before. Unity is also essential to enable workers to provide fraternal assistance to each other in their just struggles. The WFTU particularly emphasizes the vital necessity of developing friendship and mutual understanding among working people in all countries at this stage.

Working people united within national and international trade union organizations are becoming the most reliable pillar of democratic forces worldwide.

The WFTU reminds the central organizations of trade unions in all countries of the urgent need to strengthen their preparations for the Congress, for the founding congresses of the industrial departments of metal and machine manufacturing, textile and clothing, shoemaking and leather industries to be held from June 20th to 22nd, and for the founding congresses of the industrial departments of miners, seafarers, dockworkers, and construction workers to be held immediately after the WFTU Congress.

The WFTU suggests that the central organizations of national trade unions use all their possibilities (newspapers, radio, congresses and assemblies, speeches, pamphlets, and the WFTU's magazines) to widely publicize the aims and tasks of the WFTU's activities and the significance of the WFTU's Second Congress.

The WFTU invites representatives of all trade union organizations to attend the Congress so that they can be convinced of the great and noble purposes pursued by the WFTU and its democratic working methods. The WFTU calls on these trade union organizations to unite with the WFTU and strive to expand the genuine international unity of working people in all countries.

The WFTU believes that the withdrawal of certain trade unions from the WFTU, and the fact that their representatives – members of the WFTU Executive Bureau – no longer perform their duties, is only a temporary phenomenon.

The WFTU proposes that all organizations that wish to submit their demands and criticisms to the Congress participate in the Congress so that they can freely express their wishes for the consolidation of the international working class solidarity and the effective activities of the WFTU before the representatives of trade unions from all over the world.

The WFTU does not hide its purposes and tasks. These purposes and tasks were adopted by trade unions around the world at the WFTU Congress; these purposes and tasks are to organize and unite trade unions around the world in its ranks, regardless of race, nationality, religion, or political belief, to help workers in backward countries organize trade unions; to fight for the final elimination of fascism, against war and its causes; to protect the interests of working people in international organizations; to fight against infringement upon the economic and social rights and democratic freedoms of working people; to fight for increased wages, reduced working hours, and for social insurance against unemployment, disease, accidents, and old age.

The WFTU is such an organization in which representatives of various trade union tendencies can freely exchange their opinions in order to jointly create all the best conditions for safeguarding the vital interests of working people around the world.

Long live the unity, mutual assistance, and shared destiny of working people of all countries! Long live the friendship of working people of all countries, regardless of race, nationality, religion, and political belief! Salute the Second Congress of the World Federation of Trade Unions!

    世界工联告各国工会书
    通知第二届代表大会议事日程号召全世界职工团结保卫和平
    【新华社北平二十四日电】塔斯社巴黎讯：世界职工联盟二十日发表告各全国性职工会中央机构、各产业工会联合会、全世界的男女工人书，内称：世界工联第二届代表大会决于今年六月二十九日在意大利米兰举行。
    世界工联邀请一切真正职工会组织的代表参加代表大会。如果某一个全国性的职工会中央机构、职工会联合会或单个职工会，因某些理由或其他原因不能派他们的正式代表出席代表大会时，世界工联将诚挚地邀请他们派观察员参加代表大会。
    世界工联第二届代表大会将象征着职工会所属劳动人民不分种族、国籍、政治或宗教信仰的团结。
    代表大会将讨论并通过关于世界职工运动的重大问题。大会议程包括：关于世界工联活动底报告以及关于世界工联与所属各全国性中央机构在保卫劳动人民的经济与社会利益上所作行动的报告；关于建立世界工联各业职工部；关于世界工联保卫和平与人民底民主权利的活动；关于亚洲与非洲各国、澳洲与拉丁美洲等地职工会活动；关于转业与劳动人民的移民在经济与社会权利上平等的问题等报告。
    大会将民主地选出世界工联的领导机构。
    在目前有新战争和经济危机的实际危险的时候，劳动人民的团结比以往任何时候都更为必要。要使工人在他们正义的斗争中能彼此进行兄弟般的援助，团结也是必需的。世界工联特别强调现阶段在一切国家劳动人民中发展友谊和相互了解之生死攸关的必要性。
    团结在全国和国际规模的职工会组织范围之内的劳动人民，成为全世界民主力量最可靠的柱石。
    世界工联提醒一切国家的职工会中央机构，有迫切需要去加强他们对代表大会，对将于六月二十日——二十二日举行的五金与机器制造、纺织与服装、制鞋与皮革各业职工部成立大会，和对将于世界工联代表大会之后立刻举行的矿工、海员、码头工人与建筑工人职工部成立大会的准备工作。
    世界工联建议各全国性职工会中央机构利用他们一切的可能性（报纸、无线电、大会与集会、演说、小册子和世界工联的杂志），来广泛宣传世界工联活动底目的与任务，及世界工联第二届代表大会的意义。
    世界工联请一切职工会组织代表出席代表大会以便他们能够相信世界工联所追求的伟大与崇高的目的及其民主的工作方法。世界工联号召这些职工会组织与世界工联联合一致，努力来扩大一切国家劳动人民真正国际性的团结。
    世界工联认为某些职工会退出世界工联，以及他们的代表——世界工联执行机关的成员不再执行他们的职务，只是暂时的现象。
    世界工联提议，一切愿意向大会提出其要求和批评的组织，都参加代表大会，以便在世界各国职工会代表面前自由地说出他们对国际工人阶级团结的巩固和世界工联有效活动的愿望。
    世界工联并不隐瞒它的目的与任务。这些目的与任务是经由全世界的职工会在世界工联代表大会上通过了的；这些目的与任务是要把全世界的职工会不分种族、国籍、宗教或政治信仰，组织并团结在它的队伍里，帮助落后国家的工人组织职工会；为最后消灭法西斯主义、反对战争及其原因而斗争；保障在国际组织内的劳动人民底利益；为反对侵犯劳动人民底经济和社会权利与民主自由而斗争；为增加工资、减少工作时间，为对失业、疾病、意外事件与年老的社会保险而斗争。
    世界工联是这样的一个组织，在这个组织里，各种职工会倾向的代表，都可以自由地交换他们的意见，以便给保障全世界劳动人民的切身利益共同创造一切最优良的条件。
    全世界各国劳动人民底团结互助及休戚与共万岁！世界各国劳动人民，不分种族，国籍，宗教与政治信仰的友谊万岁！向世界工联第二届代表大会致敬！
