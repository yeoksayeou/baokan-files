(Jinan Telegram) After a month of intense effort, farmers across the region are nearing completion of cotton planting. According to statistics from five special districts, 4.7 million mu of cotton have been planted (the original plan for the entire region was 5,250,000 mu), an increase of approximately one million mu compared to last year. During the sowing process, various regions encountered difficulties due to drought and dry land, but the vast number of farmers believed that "man can conquer nature" and fought against the drought. In Handan, Yongnian, and other counties near rivers, the Fuyang River water was fully utilized for irrigating cotton fields, with waterwheels and treadmills operating day and night for dozens of days. Farmers in the First, Second, and Fourth Special Districts voluntarily organized mutual aid, with men, women, old, and young all mobilized to combat the drought and sow seeds. When water was insufficient, they vigorously dug wells, repaired old wells, and dug new earthen wells. Yuanchao County alone dug more than 2,000 new earthen wells. In cotton-producing areas such as Linqing, Qiu County, Yongzhi, Gaotang, and Xiajin, the area planted with cotton has reached 26% to 40% of the total cultivated land, with some districts and villages approaching pre-war levels. To solve the problem of seed shortages, the government issued cotton seed loans totaling 15 million yuan (People's Currency). In the fourteen counties near the Fu River, the local government increased loans for repairing waterwheels and wells, leading to an increase in cotton fields. If the work of pruning, fertilizing, weeding, and pest control can be done well in all cotton fields this year, with an estimated yield of 70 jin of seed cotton per mu, the region can produce more than 300 million jin of seed cotton, which will provide abundant raw materials for the urban textile industry. Areas that have not yet completed their planting plans are preparing to sow wheat stubble cotton.

　　冀南种棉接近完成
  　全区已下种四百七十万亩
    【冀南电】全区农民经过月余紧张突击，棉花种植将近完成。据五个专区统计，已种棉四百七十万亩（全区原计划为五万二千五百亩）较去年增加约达一百万亩。在播种中各地普遍遇到天旱地干的困难，但广大农民相信“人定胜天”，向旱灾进行斗争。邯郸、永年等靠河县份，充分利用滏阳河水浇地种棉，水车辘轳数十日内昼夜不闲。一、二、四专区农民自动结合互助，男女老幼总动员进行抗旱点种，水不足用，即大力掏井、修旧井打新土井，仅元朝县即挖新土井二千眼以上。临清、邱县、永智、高唐、夏津等产棉区，种棉面积已达总耕地的百分之二十六至四十，个别区村已接近抗战前水平。为解决种籽困难，政府曾发放棉种贷款达一千五百万元（人民币）。靠近滏河之十四个县份，当地政府增发修水车、水井贷款，使棉田增加。今年各棉地如能做好棉花的打杈、施追肥、锄草、除虫等工作，以每亩产籽棉七十斤计，全区可产籽棉三万万斤以上，将会给城市纺织工业供给丰富的原料。现在未完成种植计划的地区，有的正准备播种麦茬棉花。
