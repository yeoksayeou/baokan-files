    Chapter Thirteen: Exploring the Tiger's Den
    "If you don't enter the tiger's den, how can you catch the tiger cubs!"
    —Idiom

    I

    When Black Old Cai and the others received the news of Shuangxi's sacrifice, they were deeply grieved, and even many ordinary people cried. The enemy took Shuangxi's body to the city to be photographed, but it couldn't be retrieved. Black Old Cai thought, "The higher-ups have given instructions several times to open up the situation and restore the area; no matter how difficult this work is, we must break through the obstacles!" He said to Niu Dashui, "The work in Xieliu Village is even more difficult, I plan to go myself; you are still familiar with Shenjia Village, I want you to go. We Communist Party members must be resolute and brave, not afraid of sacrifice, if one doesn't succeed, another will go, we must succeed! Dashui, what do you say? Do you have the courage to go?"

    Dashui had wanted to volunteer to go for a long time, but Shuangxi didn't succeed, and he was afraid that his ability was even less sufficient to complete the task, so the words came to his mouth and then he swallowed them back. Now that he saw Black Old Cai asking him, he said, "Old Cai, you don't need to mobilize me! I accept the task given to me by the Party. If I sacrifice, it will be an honor!" Gao Tuncai rushed to go. Xiaomei interjected, "You male comrades, your targets are too big, and it's easy to be exposed; it's better for us women to mix in, the enemy doesn't pay attention." Dashui said with a smile, "I already have the order flag in my hand, no one can take it away!" Old Cai said, "That's right, don't argue. Whoever is suitable for what, does what. Everyone has work to do, no one can be idle." After discussing for a while, except for Xiaomei guarding the organization, the others were assigned tasks; they agreed to return to Dayang Village in three days to gather. The comrades who were opening up the area, all set off that night.

    Dashui accepted Shuangxi's experience and prepared to go a little later, to avoid encountering the enemy. In the middle of the night, he was about to set off, but the old fellow villager who was supposed to send him hadn't arrived yet, Dashui was very anxious. Xiaomei said, "Don't wait, there are plenty of boats. Everyone is asleep at this time, it's too much trouble to find someone temporarily, I'll send you!" Dashui said with a smile, "Come on! It's easy to go, but how will you come back alone? This Baiyang Lake is easy to get lost in." Xiaomei blamed him and said, "Look at you! Looking at people through a crack in the door, looking down on people. I was also born by the river and grew up by the river; I don't know how many times I've walked this road, back and forth by boat, how could I make a mistake?"

    Dashui saw that she was confident, so he didn't object anymore. The two came to the shore and untied a small boat. Xiaomei said, "You sit on the bow of the boat." Dashui said, "If I row, I can still ask you..." Xiaomei grabbed it and said, "Don't! I'm fine, your work is much harder." Dashui sat on the bow of the boat, facing Xiaomei. Xiaomei stood steadily on the stern of the boat, one foot in front and one foot behind, rolled up her sleeves, put the "oar leaf" on the "oar fork" skillfully, and with two hands rowing the oar skillfully, the small boat gently swayed away. The round moon originally reflected in the water was shattered, and the silver light flickered and swayed on the surface of the water.

    The boat turned a corner and came to the big lake. It was quiet all around, without a sound, only the oars slapping the water with a "whoosh—whoosh" sound. After walking for a while, Xiaomei said, "Where do you plan to settle down first this time?" Dashui said, "I plan to find Uncle Li Er first, who lives next door to my house. What do you think?" Xiaomei thought to herself, "Well, I know this old man too, he has a good understanding of the Eighth Route Army, I just don't know how he is now... Later, if you suddenly go to Shen Yaogzong's house, what if you run into Japanese devils and puppet soldiers?" Dashui said, "I have to find out before I go. Old Cai has already talked to me, we try to kill as few people as possible, if we really can't win them over, we'll kill them and break out; if we run into Japanese devils and puppet soldiers with him, it's the same way; anyway, if we can't run away, we'll sacrifice gloriously. There's a car in front and a track behind, Shuangxi is my example!"

    Xiaomei's heart tightened when she heard this sentence. She rowed silently, her big eyes shining brightly, staring straight at Dashui, with many words in her heart, but she couldn't say them. After a moment of silence, she stopped the oar with one hand, wiped the beads of sweat on her head, and said, "Dashui! This time you are going to pull teeth from the tiger's mouth, you have to be careful, don't have any slip-ups. Keep your eyes and ears open; when you encounter a critical moment, keep calm! ... You must remember my words ... When you complete the task, come back on time, don't make everyone miss you!"

    Dashui was very grateful and happy in his heart when he saw Xiaomei caring about him so much. He looked at Xiaomei, grinned; waved his hand, and said with great confidence, "Xiaomei, don't worry! I must complete the task this time! I've been working for so many years, I can't eat the common people's cornmeal for nothing. Black Old Cai has already taught me many methods, and I will definitely keep your words in mind at all times, and I will never make a mistake. You wait for the good news!" As he spoke, he was not far from the enemy; he could see the lights on the sentry tower, and hear the "hey—oh—" shouts on the sentry tower. The two were silent.

    Yang Xiaomei tapped the reeds lightly with the oar; the small boat floated lightly, and quickly. After a while, she pressed down with her left hand and swiped a few times with her right hand; the small boat spun around and quietly bypassed Sun Gong embankment, leaning against the shore. Dashui jumped ashore, turned back to her and smiled, and said, "You go back." Then he turned around and drilled into the green gauze tent and disappeared. Xiaomei stared straight into the green gauze tent, listening to the rustling sound going away, then slowly rowed the small boat into the reeds; after listening for a long time, she then rowed back with the oar.

    II

    Niu Dashui bypassed the west end and entered the village, quietly slipped along the base of the wall to the door of Li Ershu's house, climbed over the wall into the yard from the side toilet. At the base of the window, he called twice in a low voice, but there was no response from inside; then he used a sorghum stalk to stir inside the window. Someone coughed inside, but they still didn't dare to respond. Dashui called again: "Second Uncle, Second Uncle, it's me, open the door quickly!"

    Li Ershu recognized the accent, then opened the door to let him in, blocked the window with a quilt, lit the lamp, and pulled Dashui in, saying: "Oh my god! How did you come?" Dashui said: "I came to see you. Second Uncle, has the 'fortress' we dug before collapsed?" Li Ershu said: "It hasn't collapsed. Take a look!" He held a lamp to shine on it. Dashui pushed open the brick in front of the kang, inside was a small moon gate; this cave led directly to the bottom of the kang in the neighbor's house. Dashui thought to himself, "Okay, this is guaranteed."

    Li Ershu put down the lamp, and told in detail how Dashui's father died, how Shuangxi sacrificed, and reported the situation in the village, saying that there was no shortage of household registration checks day and night. Finally, he said: "Dashui, these bastards are really hateful! I think about you every day, I look forward to you, and I almost blinded my old eyes. Today, you are here! You stay with me, don't go, as long as I, an old man, am here, you will be!"

    Li Ershu's son and daughter-in-law both got up and came to this room to talk to Dashui affectionately. After a while, the rooster crowed. Dashui got into the cave; the old man handed him the quilt, and the daughter-in-law even stuffed him with a pillow, and Dashui ate and slept inside.

    Dashui slept in the cave for a whole day. At dusk, he came out and said to Li Ershu: "I'm going to find Shen Yaogzong." The old man was surprised and said: "Why are you looking for him? He is the big township chief, very powerful!" Dashui said: "It doesn't matter! I have a way to deal with him. If I make a mistake, I won't expose you even if I die!"

    Li Ershu stared at him with wide eyes, and tightly clenched Dashui's hand with a hand full of blue veins, and said: "Don't say that, good boy! You risk your lives to do it, isn't it for us common people! What am I, a poor old man, afraid of? ... But, how do you find him?" Dashui said: "I'll go to his house to find him." Li Ershu thought for a while, and said: "Don't go yet; I'll go and check the situation first, then you go." The old man carried an empty oil bottle, pretending to buy oil, and went out.

    After a while, Li Ershu came back and said: "He's at home, go quickly! I have an idea, let's do this: I'll walk in front, you follow far behind, and then I'll ask my boy to walk behind you, we father and son will protect you on both sides. If we encounter bad guys, we'll cough as a signal, and you hide quickly. Do you think this idea is good?" Dashui happily said: "Good! Let's do it this way." Then he said: "If I make a mistake, you go to Dayang Village to send a message..." Li Ershu quickly stopped him and said: "Don't say that, good boy! God bless you, you won't make a mistake!" Dashui said with a smile: "Okay, okay, okay!"

    The three people went out one after another, turned two corners and arrived. Shen Yaogzong's house was a tall gatehouse, with two very old black doors open. Dashui looked around, mustered his courage, took out the box cannon, loaded it with bullets, and cocked both the big and small hammers, and walked in.

    III

    In the front yard of Shen Yaogzong's house, the south room was dark, with no lights on. The second door was a round doorway, without a door. Niu Dashui went in, and saw that the north room and the east and west rooms in the inner courtyard were all lit. In the dark courtyard, the windows looked particularly bright. Dashui went straight to the main room, and listened at the door, but there was no sound inside. Dashui thought to himself, "If there were any traitors' troops, they would definitely be talking." So he quietly entered the main room.

    The main room was dark. There was light in the east room, with a door curtain hanging; a pungent smell of opium drifted out. Dashui suddenly thought: "Damn it! Isn't he smoking opium with the head of the puppet army, that's why he's not talking?" He thought to himself: "If the head of the puppet army is with his guards, I'll hit the ones with guns first, then the ones on the kang." He used the gun head to lift the door curtain and rushed in.

    第十三回  探虎穴
    不入虎穴，焉得虎子！
    ——成语
    一
    黑老蔡他们得到双喜牺牲的消息，非常悲痛，连许多老百姓都哭了。双喜的尸首给敌人运到城里去照像，又弄不出来。黑老蔡心里想：“上级几次来指示，要打开局面，恢复地区；这个工作再艰苦，也得突破难关！”他对牛大水说：“斜柳村工作更难搞，我准备自己去；申家庄你还熟，我想叫你去。咱们共产党员得坚决勇敢，不怕牺牲，一个不行再去一个，总得成了功！大水，你怎么着？有这个胆子去吗？”
    大水早想提出要去的，只是双喜没成功，他怕自己的能力更不够，完成不了任务，话到口边又咽下去了。这会儿见黑老蔡问他，就说：“老蔡，你不用动员我！我接受党给我的任务。万一我牺牲了，也是光荣的！”旁边高屯儿抢着要去。小梅插嘴说：“你们男同志，谁的目标都大，容易暴露；倒不如让我们妇女混进去，敌人不注意。”大水笑着说：“我手里已经拿到令字旗，你们谁也抢不走啦！”老蔡说：“对，别争了。谁合适干什么就干什么。大家都有工作，谁也闲不住。”商量了一阵，除了小梅守机关，旁的人都分配了任务；约定三天以后都回到大杨庄集合。开辟地区的同志们，这一天晚上统出发了。
    大水接受双喜的经验，准备晚一点去，免得碰见敌人。半夜里，他要出发了，事先约好送他的老乡可还不见来，大水很着急。小梅说：“别等了，船有的是。这会儿人们都睡了，临时找也很麻烦，就我送你去吧！”大水笑着说：“得了吧！去的时候好办，回来你一个人怎么着？这白洋淀可容易失迷呢。”小梅怪他说：“看你！隔着门缝儿瞧人，把人看扁啦。我也是河边生，河边长；这一条路，船来船往也不知道走过多少遭儿，还有个错呀？”
    大水看她有把握，也不再反对。两个来到岸边，解了一支小船。小梅说：“你坐到船头上去吧。”大水说：“我打棹么，还能叫你……”小梅抢着说：“别！我没事，你这个工作可辛苦多啦。”大水就在船头上，对着小梅坐下。小梅立在船梢上，两脚一前一后的站稳，挽了挽袖子，把“棹荷叶”套着“棹丫子”，两只手儿熟练的一打棹，小船就轻轻荡开去了。原来映在水里的一个圆圆的月儿，给打得粉碎，银亮的光，在水面上忽闪忽闪的摆动。
    船儿转了个弯，来到大淀。四下里静悄悄的，没一点声音，只有棹儿哗啦——哗啦的打着水。走了一阵，小梅说：“你这回去，打算先到哪儿落脚？”大水说：“我打算先找李二叔，就是住在我家隔壁的。你看怎么样？”小梅寻思着说：“嗯，这位老人家我也认得，对八路军挺有认识，就是不知道这会儿怎么样……以后，你突到申耀宗家里，要碰上鬼子伪军怎么办呢？”大水说：“我总得探清楚才去么。老蔡已经跟我谈好了，咱们尽量少杀人，实在争取不成，再打死了往外突；万一碰上鬼子伪军跟他在一块儿，也是一样的办法；反正跑不了就光荣牺牲。前有车，后有辙，双喜就是我的榜样！”
    小梅一听这句话，心就抽紧了。她默默的打着棹，一对大眼睛发亮的直望着大水，心里有许多话儿，可说不出来。静了一会儿，她一支手停了棹，擦擦头上冒出来的汗珠儿，说：“大水啊！你这一去，是到老虎嘴里拔牙，可得多加小心，千万别有个失闪。眼睛耳朵放灵动些；遇到紧要关头，可沉住气！……你可得记住我的话……完成了任务就按时候回来，别叫大伙儿结记你！”
    大水见小梅这样关心他，心里很感激，很快活。他望着小梅，笑咧开了嘴；挥着手儿，很有信心的说：“小梅，你放心！我这回非完成任务不行！干了这么些年的工作，不能白吃了老百姓的棒子面儿。黑老蔡已经教给我许多办法，你的话我也一定时时刻刻放在心上，决不会出错。你等着好消息吧！”说着，离敌人不远了；望得见岗楼上的灯光，听得见岗楼上“喂——噢—”的叫唤。两个人都不言声了。
    杨小梅挨着苇塘，轻轻的打棹；小船儿轻轻的飘，飘了个快。一会儿，她左手往下一按，右手一连划了几下；小船儿滴溜溜转过来，悄悄往孙公堤绕过去，傍了岸。大水跳上岸，回头对她笑了笑，说：“你回去吧。”就转过身去，钻进青纱帐，不见了。小梅直望着青纱帐里，听那悉悉杀杀的声音去远，才慢慢儿把小船划到苇塘里；又听了许久，这才打着棹儿回来。
    二
    牛大水绕西头进了村，贴墙根轻轻溜到李二叔家门口，从旁边的毛厕里，爬墙进了院。在窗户根前，低低叫了两声，里面没回音；又用一根秫秸棍，入进窗户里搅了搅。里面咳嗽了，可是还不敢搭腔。大水又叫：“二叔，二叔，是我啊，你快开开门！”
    李二叔听出口音了，才开门接他进去，用被子把窗户堵住，点了灯，拉着大水说：“老天爷！你怎么来啦？”大水说：“我来看看你。二叔，咱们从前挖的‘堡垒’塌了没有？”李二叔说：“没塌。你瞧瞧！”他端个灯照着。大水推开炕前的砖，里面是个小月亮门；这洞一直通到隔壁人家的炕底下。大水心里想：“行喽，这就有了保证啦。”
    李二叔放下灯，把大水爹怎么死的，双喜怎么牺牲的，一五一十说了个仔细；又报告村里的情形，说白天黑夜短不了清查户口。末了他说：“大水啊，这些王八蛋操的真可恶！我天天想你们，盼你们，差点儿把我的老眼都盼瞎啦。今天，你可来了！你就待在我这儿，不要走，有我老头儿就有你！”
    李二叔的儿子媳妇都起来了，到这边屋里亲热的和大水说话。一会儿，鸡叫了。大水钻进洞里；老头儿把被子递给他，那媳妇还塞进个枕头，大水就在里面吃饭、睡觉。
    大水在洞里足足睡了一天。傍黑，他出来对李二叔说：“我找申耀宗去。”老头儿吃惊说：“你怎么找他？他是大乡长啊，可厉害多咧！”大水说：“不碍事！我有办法对付他。万一我出了错儿，死也不暴露你！”
    李二叔睁大眼儿瞧着他，用一只满是青筋的手，紧紧攒住大水的手说：“别那么说，好小子！你们泼出命去干，不是为了咱老百姓啊！我一个穷老头子怕什么？………可是，你怎么找他呢？”大水说：“我到他家里找他去。”李二叔想了一下，说：“你先别走呢；我先去探探风势，你再去。”老头儿提着个空油瓶，假装打油，走出去了。
    一会儿，李二叔回来说：“在家呢，快走吧！我想了个主意，咱们这么着：我走在头里，你远远儿跟在后面，再叫我小子走在你后头，我们爷儿俩给你两头保着镖。要是碰见坏蛋，我们咳嗽为记，你忙躲开。你看这个主意使得使不得？”大水高兴的说：“好！咱们就这么着。”又说：“万一我出了错儿，你们到大杨庄报个信……”李二叔忙止住他说：“别那么说，好小子！天保佑你，决出不了错儿！”大水笑着说：“好好好！”
    三个人先后出了门，拐了两个弯儿就到了。申耀宗的家是个高门楼儿，两扇挺老的黑门敞开着。大水两头望了望，壮一壮胆，掏出盒子枪，顶上了子儿，大小机头都张着，就走进去了。
    三
    申耀宗家前院里，南屋黑着，没点灯。二门是个圆门洞，没有门。牛大水进去，看见里院北屋、东西屋都点着灯。黑暗的院子里，窗户显得特别亮。大水直奔上房，在门口一听，里面没人声。大水心里想：“要是有汉奸队，一定会说话的。”就轻轻儿进了堂屋。
    堂屋黑着。东间可有灯光，吊了个门帘儿；飘出来一股大烟味儿刺鼻子。大水猛然想：“妈的！他不是跟伪军头子一块儿抽大烟，才不说话吧？”他心里转了个弯儿：“要是伪军头子带着护兵，先打拿枪的，再打炕上的。”他使枪头子一挑门帘，就闯进去了。（未完）
