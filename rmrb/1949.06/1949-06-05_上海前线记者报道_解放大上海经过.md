Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 4th. Shanghai frontline reporters reported on the People's Liberation Army's liberation of Greater Shanghai:

　　In a general offensive lasting less than three days, the People's Liberation Army completely liberated Shanghai, Asia's largest metropolis with a population of six million. In this offensive campaign, the People's Liberation Army, with fierce and rapid combat, shattered all the permanent defensive fortifications in Shanghai that the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang boasted were "33 percent more solid than the defense installations of Stalingrad." Preliminary statistics indicate that 150,000 Kuomintang bandit troops were annihilated, achieving the greatest victory since the crossing-the-Yangtze campaign.

　　Smashing Ten Thousand Enemy Bunkers, Annihilating 150,000 Bandit Troops

　　When the million-strong People's Liberation Army crossed the natural barrier of the Yangtze River on a thousand-mile front, routed the Kuomintang bandit troops, liberated Nanjing, and advanced rapidly southward, the public enemy Chiang Kai-shek personally took charge of gathering the remnants and attempted to organize a last-ditch resistance in Shanghai. At that time, Chiang Kai-shek concentrated the following forces in Shanghai: the 37th Army, 52nd Army, 75th Army, 12th Army, 54th Army, 123rd Army, remnants of the 21st Army, remnants of the 51st Army, 95th Division, Provisional 8th Division, 99th Division, and 204th Division, totaling eight regular armies and twenty-three divisions. In addition, there were most of the remaining air force and the First Fleet of the navy, personally commanded by war criminals Zhou Zhirou and Gui Yongqing, as well as many artillery, engineer, communications, armored units, security brigades, traffic police corps, and military police, totaling approximately 200,000 men.

　　The Kuomintang bandit troops' defense works in the Shanghai-Songhu area were divided into three lines of defense: outer perimeter, main position, and core position. These positions had been rushed into construction since January of this year.

　　1. Outer Perimeter: The line from Liuhe, Luodian, Jiading, Nanxiang, Huacao Town, Qibao Town to Huajing Town constituted the outer perimeter defense on the west bank of the Huangpu River; the line from Chuansha City to Beicai Town constituted the outer perimeter defense on the east bank.

　　2. Main Position: The line from Shizi Lin northwest of Baoshan City, southward through Yuepu, Yanghang, Liuhang, Dachang, Zhenru, Beixinyuan, Hongqiao, Longhua, to the Huangpu River, constituted the main position on the west bank; the line from Gaoqiao southward, through Gaohang, Yangjing Town, to Tangqiao constituted the main position on the east bank.

　　3. Core Position: Utilized tall buildings in the main urban areas as fortified resistance strongholds, with sandbags piled up at key intersections of streets, and chevaux-de-frise and barbed wire deployed.

　　Each town in the outer perimeter and main position was built into a group of fortifications as a key resistance point. The main position was 3,000 meters from the urban area, and within this 3,000-meter depth, there were over 3,800 reinforced concrete bunkers densely distributed. Behind the main position, there were several intersecting lines of defense. The gaps between key points were filled with many field semi-permanent shelters and reinforced concrete mobile bunkers as satellite fortifications. These bunkers, both large and small (reinforced concrete and earth-and-wood), numbered over 10,000. The A-type bunkers were more than two feet thick, and each bunker was surrounded by seven to ten layers of spiderweb-like ditches, electric fences, minefields, barbed wire, bamboo spikes, and fences. At the stations and airports in the depth of the main position, independent stronghold fortifications were built, and in the urban fringe areas, stations, schools, and factories were used to construct complex positions.

　　In order to construct the defense positions, war criminal Tang Enbo and others ordered their troops to cut down, level, and burn the houses and bamboo forests in many villages within dozens of miles of the suburbs, turning them into uninhabited ruins. In this area, millions of people were left homeless, and the originally prosperous and bustling Shanghai suburbs became a terrifying hell. In addition, bandit Tang Enbo ordered his troops to destroy the bridges on the Shanghai-Nanjing Railway, Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway, and various highways, attempting to prevent the advance of the People's Liberation Army. In Shanghai city, bandit chiefs Chiang Kai-shek, Tang Enbo, Chen Daqing, and Shi Jue intensified their looting of the people's property, transporting materials and factory machinery and equipment. Those that could not be moved were destroyed, implementing a "three-all" policy of looting, moving, and destroying, attempting to ruin Shanghai.

　　The Kuomintang bandit gang, deserted and alienated, used countless killing decrees such as "strikers and slackers will be killed" and "those who incite student unrest will be killed" to suppress the Shanghai people who glared at them. These bandits also used extremely barbaric and terrifying means to suppress and control their uncontrollable army. Bandit Tang Enbo issued orders stipulating "joint responsibility" and "supervision of combat," with fifteen counts of capital offenses, including "those who lack combat will and show fear," "those who look around and speak unfavorably," "those who lose contact," "those who are lazy and negligent," "those who do not cherish weapons and ammunition"... However, no amount of Kuomintang bandit troops' solid fortifications, burning, killing, and destruction could stop the victorious advance of the People's Liberation Army, which achieved victory step by step according to the planned schedule.

　　East-West Pincers on Wusong, Main Force Strikes Directly into the City

　　The Shanghai Campaign can be divided into two stages: from the night of May 12th to the afternoon of May 24th was the stage of outer perimeter operations. After the People's Liberation Army completely annihilated six Kuomintang armies north of the Changxing, Guangde, and Langxi line on the west bank of Taihu Lake and liberated Hangzhou, it divided into two army groups, east and west, and advanced towards Shanghai. The Western Army Group attacked eastward north of the Suzhou River and the Shanghai-Nanjing Railway. From May 11th to 15th, they successively liberated Kunshan, Taicang, Jiading and other county towns, as well as important strongholds such as Luodian, Liuhe, Yuepu and Liuhang, driving a wedge into the enemy's main position. On the 19th, they occupied the Liuhang International Radio Station and the Gujiazai stronghold to its east, directly threatening Wusong. At the same time, the Eastern Army Group advanced rapidly along the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway, the Huangpu River, and the coast. On the 13th, they liberated Haiyan, Pinghu, Jinshan (Zhujing), Songjiang, Fengxian, Nanhui and other cities and important ports such as Zhaopu and Jinshanwei. On the night of the 15th, they occupied Gujialu Town, twenty miles northwest of Chuansha City, and continued to advance towards the seaside resort of Gaoqiao. On the night of the 16th, they completely annihilated the remnants of the enemy's 54th Army and the Provisional 8th Division in the area of Linjia Wharf and Xiaoyingfang northeast of Chuansha City, killing and capturing 8,000 enemy troops. By the 20th, after liberating more than ten important strongholds such as South Gaohang Town, North Gaohang Town, and Jinjiaqiao Town, the Huangpu River surface upstream of Gaohang was completely exposed to the fire of the People's Liberation Army. The People's Liberation Army then divided the enemy's positions in Pudong into two parts, north and south. The enemy's 12th Army, 75th Army, and 95th Division, compressed in the Gaoqiao Town and the ox horn-shaped area to its west and north, repeatedly fought for positions as many as eight or nine times with the cooperation of the enemy's air and sea forces, but were all repelled by the People's Liberation Army. On the night of the 23rd, the People's Liberation Army shattered the enemy's deep defense positions, captured over a hundred reinforced concrete bunkers in a row, and on the morning of the 24th, occupied Yangjing Town and Yinqiao Town, completely liberating the Pudong urban area. At this point, the People's Liberation Army crossed the river west of Zhoupu and launched an attack on the Puxi urban area. At this time, another unit of the People's Liberation Army attacking along the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway, after liberating Songjiang, attacked Shanghai's west side northward. On the 14th, they liberated Sijing Town and Qingpu County, more than 30 miles southwest of Shanghai, and Cuizhuang and Qibao Town northwest of Shanghai County (North Bridge) on the 15th. On the night of the 23rd, they launched a fierce attack on the enemy's main position in the southwestern suburbs of Shanghai. Under the cover of powerful artillery fire, the People's Liberation Army, with minimal casualties, broke through the enemy's twenty-mile deep layers of fortifications, destroyed and occupied more than 500 reinforced concrete bunker groups, and successively occupied Hongqiao Town, Hongqiao Airport, Xujiahui, and Fanwangdu Station, and then crossed the International Cemetery, Dahongqiao, West Zhongshan Road, Shanghai-Hangzhou Road, and struck directly into the urban area. The People's Liberation Army, which occupied Longhua Town and Longhua Airport on the afternoon of the same day, also advanced towards the urban area at the same time.

　　By the afternoon of the 24th, the People's Liberation Army had advanced more than 200 miles in the outer perimeter operations of Shanghai, liberated 12 county towns one after another, annihilated more than 20,000 enemy troops, and completed the encirclement of Greater Shanghai. Our east and west army groups, like two huge pincers, tightly clamped the Wusong Fortress, breaking through the enemy's main position from all directions, east, west, north, and south, driving deep into the position, and achieving a decisive victory in the Shanghai campaign.

　　From the evening of the 24th to 9:00 AM on the 27th was the stage of the general offensive. The general offensive lasted only sixty hours, and Shanghai was completely liberated.

　　At about 9:00 PM on the 24th, the People's Liberation Army, advancing along the Shanghai-Hangzhou Road, attacked into the urban area from Fanwangdu, Xujiahui, Longhua Town, and Gaochangmiao. The remnants of the defending enemy fled north of the Suzhou River, and the People's Liberation Army pursued them all the way. At 1:00 AM, the armies from all directions met at the Racecourse in the city center and occupied most of the urban area. At 10:00 AM on the 25th, the main urban area of Shanghai south of the Suzhou River was liberated. The People's Liberation Army then quickly crossed the Suzhou River and attacked the Hebei area. In this situation, the enemy north of the Suzhou River was extremely chaotic and panicked. On the 25th and 26th, Liu Changyi, deputy commander of the Kuomintang Shanghai Garrison Headquarters, and his 21st Army, 51st Army, and 123rd Army remnants, totaling more than 40,000 men, surrendered to the People's Liberation Army in Zhenru, Dachang, and other places. At 6:00 AM on the 26th, the People's Liberation Army took advantage of the victory and advanced rapidly in several directions, successively occupying many important strongholds and vast urban areas such as Jiangwan, Jiangwan Station, the Kuomintang Shanghai-Nanjing-Hangzhou Garrison Headquarters, the Shanghai Garrison Headquarters, and the Armored Corps Headquarters, capturing more than 10,000 enemy troops from the 54th Army and 37th Army, annihilating part of the 52nd Army, and the remaining enemy troops had no way to escape and were forced to surrender to the People's Liberation Army by company, regiment, and division.

　　While the People's Liberation Army was encircling and annihilating the bandit troops in the Shanghai urban area, on the night of the 25th, the People's Liberation Army finally converged the two giant pincers at the mouth of the Huangpu River, attacking Wusong Fortress from the east and west. The People's Liberation Army on the Pudong side occupied the key town of Gaoqiao at 12:00 AM on the same night. At 8:00 PM on the 26th, they successively captured more than 20 strongholds such as the old city of Baoshan County and the seaside resort, pursued the fleeing enemy, and took Sanyi Port and Texaco Wharf, capturing 12,000 enemy troops from the 12th Army and 75th Army, killing and wounding more than 1,000. The enemy in the Pudong area was completely cleared. The People's Liberation Army on the Puxi side, launching a general offensive against Baoshan City and Wusong Town, occupied the Shizi Lin Battery at 2:00 AM on the 26th and occupied Baoshan City and Wusong Town at 4:00 AM with minimal casualties, capturing more than 13,000 enemy troops. At this point, the entire Wusong Fortress fell completely into the hands of the People's Liberation Army, and the last escape route of the remaining enemy in Shanghai was completely closed.

　　General Offensive in Sixty Hours, Shanghai Completely Liberated

　　At 9:00 AM on the 27th, the People's Liberation Army finally cleared out the remaining enemy in the Yangshupu area, and Shanghai, the largest city in Asia, was declared completely liberated.

　　In the Shanghai campaign, the People's Liberation Army once again demonstrated its astonishing ability to overcome fortifications. Under the attack of the People's Liberation Army's heroic infantry and artillery, all the so-called permanent defense works of the Kuomintang bandit troops were reduced to ashes. In the battle to capture Liuhang, the People's Liberation Army captured more than a hundred reinforced concrete bunkers in one night. Secondly, the People's Liberation Army also demonstrated the spirit of arduous struggle, perseverance, and fearless courage in this campaign. The Songhu area is a water network area, and during the operations, it was the season of plum rains in the Jiangnan region, with continuous rain, and the soldiers' clothes were all wet. The vast majority of troops were operating in mud creeks, and some were continuously in the water for a week. In addition, because the villages and houses were leveled by the enemy, many troops camped in the open in the rain, had no firewood to burn, and no boiled water to drink. When the war was urgent, some only had time to eat one meal a day. However, the soldiers not only had no complaints, but also had an even stronger fighting spirit, tried their best to overcome all difficulties. In the Shanghai campaign, the People's Liberation Army also fully demonstrated the true colors of a people's army that loves the people, sacrifices itself, and is strictly disciplined. In combat, some soldiers voluntarily risked danger to save the people from fire, and some did not hesitate to sacrifice themselves to save the people. During street fighting, many soldiers were afraid of accidentally injuring the people with artillery fire, and were willing to engage in hand-to-hand combat with the enemy. Each unit camped on the side of the road and did not occupy factories, schools, shops, or churches. They did not take a single needle or thread from the people. These lofty revolutionary qualities of the People's Liberation Army have received the widespread and greatest love and admiration of the Shanghai people.

　　The great victory won by the People's Liberation Army in Shanghai is also inseparable from the support of the broad masses of the people in Shanghai and Jiangnan. As the People's Liberation Army advanced towards Shanghai, the people along the way flocked to help the People's Liberation Army as guides, provide food and grass, repair roads and bridges, protect factories, and protect railways. The Qingyang Port railway bridge, which was destroyed by the enemy, was repaired in four days, thus enabling the Shanghai-Nanjing Railway to fully resume traffic on the same day that Shanghai was liberated. Before liberation, the workers and students of Shanghai had engaged in heroic struggles such as protecting factories and schools against the Kuomintang reactionaries. After liberation, they immediately organized to maintain order. Many workers even seized enemy weapons in combat, armed themselves, and joined the People's Liberation Army in combat. This revolutionary spirit of the Shanghai people will undoubtedly demonstrate incomparably great strength in building a new Greater Shanghai in the future.

  　解放大上海经过
    【新华社上海四日电】上海前线记者报道人民解放军解放大上海的经过称：
    围攻上海的人民解放军，发起总攻不到三天就完全解放了这拥有六百万人口的亚洲第一大都市。人民解放军在这次战役攻势中，以猛烈迅速的战斗，粉碎了蒋介石匪帮吹嘘为“比斯大林格勒的防御设置还要坚固百分之三十三”的上海一切永久设防工事，据初步统计，歼灭了国民党匪军十五万之众，取得了渡江作战以来最伟大的胜利。
  　粉碎敌堡万座歼匪军十五万
    当人民解放军百万大军在千里战线上渡过长江天险，击溃国民党匪军，解放南京并向南猛进的时候，人民公敌蒋介石就亲自出马收拾残兵败将，企图在上海组织垂死的抵抗。当时蒋介石集结在上海的兵力，计有三十七军、五十二军、七十五军、十二军、五十四军、一二三军、二十一军残部、五十一军残部、九十五师、暂八师、九十九师和二○四师，共正规军八个军，二十三个师；此外，还有由战犯周至柔、桂永清亲自指挥的绝大部分仅剩的空军和海军第一舰队，以及许多炮兵、工兵、通讯兵、装甲部队、保安旅团、交通警察总队和宪兵等，共约二十万人。
    国民党匪军在淞沪地区的防御工事分为外围阵地、主阵地和核心阵地三道设防地带，这些阵地工事，自今年一月起即加工赶修。
    一、外围阵地：自浏河、罗店、嘉定、南翔、华曹镇、七宝镇至华泾镇之线，为浦西外围阵地；以川沙城至北蔡镇之线，为浦东外围阵地。
    二、主阵地：由宝山城西北之狮子林向南分经月浦、杨行、刘行、大场、真茹、北新源、虹桥、龙华、直至黄浦江边之线，为浦西之主阵地；由高桥向南，经高行、洋泾镇至唐桥之线，为浦东之主阵地。
    三、核心阵地：则为利用主要市区内高大的建筑物，作为强固的抵抗据点，在各街道要冲堆积沙袋，布置木马、铁丝网。
    在外围阵地和主阵地中的各集镇，皆作为抵抗重点，每点筑成集团工事。主阵地距市区三千公尺，在此三千公尺纵深内，密布钢骨水泥的碉堡群三千八百余个。主阵地向后，有数道交叉的阵地。各重点间的空隙，还有许多野战半永久性掩体及钢骨水泥活动堡，作为卫星工事。这些大小碉堡（钢骨水泥的与土木的）共有一万多座。甲种碉堡厚二英尺多，每座碉堡周围，有蛛网式的河沟、电网、地雷阵、铁丝网、竹签、篱笆等副防御七道至十道。在主阵地纵深的车站、飞机场，皆筑有独立的据点工事，并在市区边缘地带，利用各车站、学校、工厂构筑复广阵地。
    战犯汤恩伯等为了构筑阵地，命令所部将市郊数十里内许多村庄房屋与竹林砍光，拆平，烧毁，成为一片杳无人烟的瓦砾。在这一地区内，千万人民无家可归，原来是富庶繁华的上海郊区，变成了可怕的地狱。此外，汤匪恩伯并命令所部破坏了京沪路、沪杭路及各公路的桥梁，企图阻止人民解放军的前进。在上海市内，匪首蒋介石、汤恩伯、陈大庆、石觉等则加紧抢掠人民的财产，搬运物资及工厂机器设备；无法搬走者则进行破坏，实行抢光、搬光、破光的三光政策，企图毁灭上海。
    众叛亲离的国民党匪帮用“罢工怠工者杀”，“鼓动学潮者杀”等无数杀条来镇压对他们怒目而视的上海人民。这些匪徒们同样用极端野蛮和恐怖的手段来镇压和控制他们无法控制的军队。汤匪恩伯曾下命令规定“纵横连坐法”和“督战法”，杀罪有十五条，其中有“战志不坚形现惧色者杀”，“左顾右盼出言不利者杀”，“失去连络者杀”，“懒惰疏忽者杀”，“不爱惜武器弹药者杀”……。但是任何国民党匪军的坚固工事和烧杀破坏，都无法阻止人民解放军的胜利前进，解放军按着预定计划逐步取得胜利。
  　东西钳击吴淞大军直捣市区
    上海战役，可分为两个阶段：自五月十二日夜间起至二十四日下午止，为外围作战阶段。人民解放军在太湖西岸的长兴、广德、郎溪一线以北地区全歼国民党六个军并解放杭州以后，即分成东西两兵团向上海进军。西路兵团由苏州河及京沪路以北向东进攻。五月十一日至十五日先后解放昆山、太仓、嘉定等县城及罗店、浏河、月浦和刘行等重要据点，楔入敌军主阵地。十九日即占领刘行国际无线电台及其以东的顾家宅据点，直逼吴淞。与此同时，东路兵团沿沪杭路黄浦江及海岸长途疾进。十三日解放海盐、平湖、金山（朱泾）、松江、奉贤、南汇等城及要港乍浦、金山卫。十五日晚占领川沙城西北二十里之顾家路镇，续向海滨浴场高桥挺进。十六日晚，将敌五十四军残部及暂八师残部全部歼灭于川沙城东北的林家码头、小营房一带，毙俘敌八千人。至二十日，解放军连克南高行镇、北高行镇、金家桥镇、东沟镇等重要据点十多处后，高行上游黄浦江面即全部暴露在解放军炮火之下。解放军继即将浦东敌军阵地拦顶分成南北两块。被压缩在高桥镇及其以西以北的牛角尖上的敌十二军、七十五军和九十五师曾在敌海空配合下，反复争夺阵地达八、九次之多，皆被解放军击退。二十三日夜，解放军粉碎敌纵深工事阵地，连下百余座钢骨水泥碉堡，二十四日晨占领洋泾镇、尹桥镇，完全解放了浦东市区。至此，解放军乃在周浦以西一举渡江向浦西市区进击。此时，沿沪杭路进攻的人民解放军另部，继解放松江之后，北向上海西侧进攻。十四日解放上海市西南三十多里的泗泾镇及青浦县城，十五日解放上海县城（北桥）及其西北的翠庄、七宝镇。二十三日晚，即猛攻上海西南郊敌军主阵地。在强大炮火掩护下，解放军以极小伤亡突破敌纵深二十里之层层工事，打毁与占领敌五百多座钢骨水泥碉堡群，连续攻占虹桥镇，虹桥飞机场，徐家汇与梵王渡车站，继越万国公墓、大虹桥、中山西路、沪杭路，直捣市区。同日下午攻占龙华镇及龙华飞机场之解放军，亦同时向市区挺进。
    到二十四日下午止，人民解放军在上海外围作战中，共前进二百余里，先后解放县城十二座，歼敌两万余人，完成了对大上海的包围。我东西两路兵团象两个巨大的钳头紧钳吴淞要塞，从东西南北各个方向，突破了敌军的主阵地，楔入纵深，取得了上海战役决定性的胜利。
    自二十四日晚起到二十七日上午九时止为总攻阶段。总攻战前后仅历六十小时，上海即全部解放。
    二十四日下午九时许，沿沪杭路前进的人民解放军分自梵王渡、徐家汇、龙华镇、高昌庙攻入市区，守敌残部向苏州河以北逃窜，解放军乃分路跟踪猛追。夜半一时，各路大军即在市中心跑马厅会师，占领大部分市区。二十五日上午十时，苏州河以南的上海主要市区遂告解放。解放军遂即又迅速渡过苏州河，攻入河北地区。在此种形势下，苏州河北之敌极形混乱，恐慌万状。二十五、六两日，国民党淞沪警备司令部副司令刘昌义及其所部二十一军、五十一军、一二三军残部等共四万余人，即先后在真茹、大场等地向解放军投降。二十六日晨六时解放军乘胜分路猛进，先后攻占江湾、江湾车站、国民党京沪杭警备总司令部、淞沪警备司令部、装甲兵团司令部等许多重要据点及广大市区，生俘敌五十四军和三十七军等部万余人，歼敌五十二军一部，其余残敌逃跑无路，被迫成营成团成师地向解放军投降。
    与解放军围歼上海市区匪军同时，二十五日晚，人民解放军就在黄浦江口最后收拢了两大铁钳，自东西两方会攻吴淞要塞。浦东方面解放军于当晚十二时攻占高桥重镇，二十六日下午八时，继克宝山县旧城、海滨浴场等据点二十多处，猛追逃敌，直取三义港和德士古码头，俘敌十二军、七十五军等部一万二千人，毙伤千余人。浦东地区之敌全告肃清。浦西方面总攻宝山城、吴淞镇的解放军，于二十六日晨二时占领狮子林炮台，晨四时以极小伤亡即占领宝山城和吴淞镇，俘敌约一万三千余人。至此，整个吴淞要塞便全部落入人民解放军的掌握中，上海残敌的最后一条逃路被完全封闭。
  　总攻六十小时上海完全解放
    二十七日九时，人民解放军于杨树浦地区最后肃清了残敌，亚洲第一个大城市上海遂宣告全部解放。
    在上海战役中，人民解放军再次表现了惊人的攻坚力量。在解放军神勇的步兵、炮兵的攻击下，一切国民党匪军所谓永久性防御工事皆被化为灰烬。在攻占刘行的战斗中，解放军一个晚上即攻占了百余座钢骨水泥碉堡。其次，人民解放军在此次战役中又表现了艰苦奋战，坚忍顽强的无畏精神。淞沪地带为水网地区，在作战中，正逢江南黄梅时节，阴雨连绵，战士衣服尽湿，绝大多数部队皆在泥浆溪沟中作战，有的连续在水中一个星期。此外，因村庄房屋被敌人平毁，许多部队雨天露营，没有柴烧，没开水吃，战争紧急时，有的一天只顾上吃一顿。但战士们不仅毫无怨言，且斗志愈坚，想尽了各种办法，克服了一切困难。在上海战役中，人民解放军还充分表现了爱护人民，自我牺牲，纪律严明的人民军队的本色。在作战中，有的战士自动冒危险为人民救火，有的不惜牺牲自己去救人民。巷战时，许多战士怕发炮误伤人民，宁愿短兵相接与敌人肉搏。各部队在马路边露营，不住工厂、学校、商店、教堂。不拿人民一针一线。解放军的这些崇高的革命品质受到了上海人民普遍的最大的热爱和敬仰。
    人民解放军在上海赢得的伟大胜利，也与上海和江南广大的人民的支援作战分不开。在人民解放军向上海进军中，沿途人民都蜂拥地起来帮助人民解放军当向导，筹粮草，抢修道路桥梁，保护工厂，保护铁路。被敌人破坏的青阳港铁桥四天就修好了，因而使京沪路在上海解放的当天就全线恢复通车。上海市工人、学生在解放前就与国民党反动派进行了英勇的护厂护校等各种斗争，解放后又立即组织起来维持秩序。有不少工人在战斗中并缴了敌人武器，武装起来，参加解放军作战。上海人民的这种革命精神，显然将在今后建设新的大上海中，表现出无比伟大的力量。
