    ——Speech by Zlobimo, Squad Leader of the Moscow Engineering Section Road Maintenance Team
    Originally published in the Soviet newspaper "Gudok" on April 22nd, translated by Sun Jingsi

　　Workers of the Moscow Engineering Section are approaching a busy time again. Going out in the morning to the section of the line—the sleepers are still covered with frost, but on the side facing the sunlight, you can already see melting. In another two or three days, we can start work.

　　In terms of line maintenance in our section during the winter, many things are old. In particular, the sleepers need to be repaired. The sleepers here are all very old. Don't forget, they should have been replaced in 1946. It is not permissible not to replace them, because many trains pass through the lines in our section—it is a main line—according to technical regulations, we should be responsible for protecting it, and there should be no negligence.

　　In our area, the number of critical points should not exceed ten. We have been using old sleepers to maintain the line for many years, trying to ask the state for fewer new ones. You should know that the transportation department needs millions of sleepers—but where are so many stored? It is best to let the places with special urgent needs lay new ones.

　　In our area, we automatically formulated a special booklet for studying sleepers. In it, you can find the number of each sleeper, and you can see its entire life: when it was laid, when certain phenomena were exposed, and when certain repairs were carried out. Track patrolmen classify and inspect all sleepers, and if they find various cracks, they will notify me. Three times a week, I check the status of the sleeper cracks notified to me. If it is consistent with the facts, I will record it in the booklet and draw up a repair date and repair method. This booklet is like a repair plan, and we must try to strictly implement it.

　　Last year, we mainly completed the work of crack prevention equipment, that is, to prevent or repair the cracks formed at both ends of the sleepers due to changes in temperature and wheel axle impacts. Regarding this work, we strictly abide by the technical requirements: first clean the cracked area, and then fill it with black oil or preservative in order to prevent the wood fibers from rotting. After injecting black oil or preservative, use special tools to tighten one end of the sleeper and install a clamp at the same time to prevent the expansion of the crack.

　　Another commonly used repair method—is to reinforce the rotten spike holes with wooden plugs. After we rectify the track gauge, we inject preservative into the old spike holes and fill them firmly with wooden plugs soaked in preservative. This not only prolongs the life of the sleepers, but also corrects the correct distance between the tracks.

　　Only on the lines in the station do we carry out large-scale sleeper repairs; however, this is very rare work. Remove the sleepers with rotten heads and then replace them with new sleepers. If the upper part of the sleeper in the middle of the track is damaged or burned not too deeply (about five centimeters), my usual repair method is to remove the damaged wood layer, apply preservative to its position, and then nail it firmly.

　　This year we want to repair twice as many sleepers as every year. In early winter, we started preparing crack prevention equipment such as clamps, shims, reinforcing materials, and other materials. Such preparation can help us complete the planned repair plan as soon as possible.

　　In my opinion, there is also more important work, which is to pay attention to the gravel around the sleepers. We strive to provide sleepers with stable, tight, evenly loaded, and flat bed holes, which can enhance the health of the sleepers. We should also pay attention not to let the rails tilt, and we should shave off any bumps that may be encountered under the shims, otherwise water will accumulate in this place and rot the wood.

　　Keeping the sleepers on the lines in the station from being easily damaged is a difficult task. The lines in the station in our area are four kilometers long. Everyone knows that four times more sleepers are replaced in the station than in the section of the line. These replaced sleepers are all destroyed because the drivers are undisciplined and do not clean up the furnace ash in the designated place. Isn't it a joke? Last year, out of the one hundred and five sleepers that were replaced, sixty-three were simply burned by the drivers and were completely unusable. However, I repaired half of the remaining forty-two and re-laid them in the station, and they are still intact.

　　It should be emphasized that last year, I replaced about three times fewer sleepers than any other squad leader in our section. The reason for this fewer replacement is that we repaired 475 sleepers, and these repaired sleepers are about five times the number of replaced sleepers. We saved more than 3,000 yuan in the first phase, which is exactly 40% of the total special budget reduction for the entire section.

　　In the production competition to welcome "May Day," we are responsible for repairing more than 50 sleepers, and at the same time, we must save twice as much money as last year. We must always maintain our strive for first place in the competition. (People's Railway News Agency)

### 看看苏联工人如何养路——莫斯科工务段道班班长兹洛比莫的讲话

　　看看苏联工人如何养路
    ——莫斯科工务段道班班长兹洛比莫的讲话
    原文载苏联汽笛报四月二十二日孙  敬思译
    莫斯科工务段工务员工们，又临到繁忙的时候，早晨出去，到区间路线上—枕木还被霜盖着，可是向着太阳光的那边，已经可以看到在融化了，再经过两三天，我们就能开始工作。
    冬天里，在本段的路线保养上来讲，很多东西全旧啦，其中特别要修补的是枕木，我们这里的枕木全是已经很旧的，不要忘记，在一九四六年就应当更换的，不更换是不许可的，因为在我们段内路线上通过很多列车——它是一个干线——按照技术规程，我们应该负责保护它，不应当有一点的疏忽。
    在我们管内，任何时评点不能多于十点，我们已经用旧枕木来维持很多年限，尽量想法向国家少要求新的，要知道对于交通部门，是须要以百万计的枕木——可是那里贮藏着这么多呢？最好让特别紧急需要的地方铺设新的吧。
    在我们的管内，我们自动地制定了专门研究枕木的一本册子，在那里边可以找到每根枕木的号数，可以见到它一生的状态：何时铺设的，何时暴露某种现象，施行某种补修。巡道夫分类检查所有枕木，如找出各样的裂纹，即通知给我，三天一次，我校对着所通知给我的枕木裂纹状态，如果与事实相符，我就记在册子上，拟定补修日期及补修办法。这本册子有如一个补修计划表，我们要想法严格地履行它。
    在去年我们主要完成了防裂设备工作，就是说因为温度及轮轴冲击的变化，在枕木的两端所构成的裂纹，想法去防止，或作补修的工作，关于此种工作，我们严格地遵守技术上的要求：先把裂纹地方打扫干净，然后用黑油或是用防腐剂将它灌好，为的是预防木质纤维腐烂，灌注黑油或防腐剂，以后利用特别工具，去压紧这枕木一头并且同时安上卡子以便防止裂纹的扩大。
    其它常用的补修方法——是以木塞补强腐烂的道钉孔，我们在轨间整正完后，将旧道钉孔灌注防腐剂，并用浸防腐剂之木塞填塞坚固，这样不只延长了枕木的寿命，并可校正轨间的正确距离。
    只有在车站上各路线，我们才进行大规模的枕木补修；不过这是很稀少的工作，撤去头部朽烂的枕木然后换上新枕木，设若遇到轨道中间的枕木上部被伤损或是被火烧不太深重（五公分左右）的时候，我常用的补修方法就是剔除被损害的木层，并且在它的位置上，涂上防腐剂，然后把它钉牢。
    今年我们想要补修的枕木比每年都要多两倍，在初冬的时候，我们就着手准备了防裂设备如挟子，垫板，补强材料和其它的材料，这样的准备能以帮助我们早日完成所拟定的补修计划。
    照我的观点来看，还有较比重要的工作，就是注意枕木周边的碎石情形，我们努力设法让枕木有稳固的、紧密的、负荷力量平均的、并且平坦的床穴，这样可以加强枕木的健康，我们还应当注意，不让钢轨有倾斜，并要削整在垫板下面可能遇到的凹凸部分，不然在这个地方就会积水，腐烂木质。
    保持站内路线枕木的不易损坏，是一件很难的工作，在我们管内的站内路线有四公里长，每个人全知道，在车站上比区间路线要多换四倍的枕木，所换的这些枕木全是因为司机没有纪律性，不在指定地方清理炉灰而受到的破坏。算不算笑谈呢？在去年从新换过的一百零五根枕木里，有六十三根是单纯的被司机所烧毁并且已经完全不能使用，可是，我从所剩的四十二根里边补修了一半，并且又重铺在车站上，到现在它们还是完整的。
    应当强调的说，在去年，我比本段的任何一位班长都少换了约三倍之多的枕木，这个少换的缘故，是因为我们补修了有四百七十五根枕木，这些补修枕木约为更换枕木的五倍。我们管内第一期节约的，特别缩减预算三千多元，恰好为全段特别缩减预算的百分之四十。
    在迎接“五一”的生产竞赛中，要负责补修五十多根枕木，同时要比去年省钱两倍，我们要永久保持着在竞赛中争取第一。　　　　（人民铁道报社）
