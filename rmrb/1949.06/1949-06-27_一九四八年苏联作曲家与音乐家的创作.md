　　The Council of the Soviet Composers Association held its second plenary meeting from December 21st to 29th last year to review the creative work of Soviet composers and musicians since the promulgation of the resolution of the Central Committee of the Communist Party "On Muradeli's Opera 'The Great Friendship'". At the meeting, more than 100 musical works by Soviet composers were played. Afterwards, the plenary session listened to and discussed the report of Khrennikov, the Secretary-General of the Association. What is presented here is an abridged version of Khrennikov's report. The subtitles are added by the translator. ——Editor

    In the history of Soviet music, 1948 was a period of fundamental reconstruction of our entire musical creation front. In January and February of this year (referring to 1948 - translator), Soviet composers obtained an invaluable theoretical weapon. In the struggle against formalist distortions in art, in the struggle for beautiful, life-like, and socialist-era music that is close to and understood by our people, the powerful ideological thought of the Party armed us ideologically.

    A document of historical significance: The resolution of our Party Central Committee "On V. Muradeli's Opera 'The Great Friendship'" and Comrade Zhdanov's speech at the Soviet Music Workers Conference convened by the Central Committee of the Communist Party not only helped us expose and condemn the anti-popular formalist tendencies in Soviet music, but also pointed out a combat program for creative work for many years to come.

    Under the banner of these instructions of the Party, we held the first All-Soviet Composers Congress in April of this year.

    The congress demonstrated the ideologically indestructible unity of Soviet musical creation forces, and the composers' and musicologists' fervent desire to embody the instructions of our Party in their creations in the shortest possible time.

    Formalist Tendencies

    How has our creative life developed in the last ten months? Have composers been able to eliminate the formalist tendencies that dominated Soviet music before the promulgation of the resolution of the Party Central Committee in their creations? Has the Composers Association been able to help composers in the direction of realism expand their positions with the active support of the direction of realism, and occupy a dominant position in our musical art?

    The vast majority of composers have sincerely and vigorously embarked on the path of realism. However, formalist phenomena still exist in the works of some of them. Prokofiev's opera "The Story of a Real Man" most clearly proves this point. The music of the opera is extremely formalistic and is extremely contradictory to the images in Polevoi's novel. It is not surprising that this opera aroused the anger and sharp protests of the Soviet public when it was staged at the Kirov Theatre in Leningrad. The appearance of this opera by Prokofiev proves that the traditions of Western modernism are very strong in his consciousness, and that for him, the full tension of the plot and the customary use of naturalistic details are more important than creating a true image of a Soviet hero with a purposeful spirit and a strong affirmative will through musical means. This approach leads to a lack of purposefulness of musical thought. This is primarily manifested in anti-melodicity and a predominance of dry recitative; recitative can only express the superficial vividness of the lyrics, but cannot express the inner world of the characters. If Prokofiev had placed more trust in the power of the collective, had not separated himself from his composers' organization during this period, and had not kept his completed opera hidden until it was presented to the public, then timely criticism from comrades might have helped Prokofiev recognize the sinfulness of the path he had chosen, reviewed the views he had developed in solitary life, and achieved success in creating a new opera with such a meaningful and important theme.

    Among the musicians, there are still some who not only do not fight formalism, but also express their belief in their old formalist idols. Undoubtedly, the music conductor Khaikin belongs to this category of people. He played a truly decisive role in the entire history of Prokofiev's new opera.

    These facts compel us to wage the most resolute struggle against all manifestations of formalism in creation and against all apologists for formalist tendencies in music without stopping. It should be remembered that formalism is not always manifested in such obvious and aggressive forms. There are many works that appear to be written in realistic language on the surface, but are actually faded, anemic, and devoid of vitality. It is precisely this seemingly "harmless" but actually more dangerous form of formalism that must be paid attention to. We have works here written in what is commonly called a very good language, works that stand on the position of unconditional respect for classical traditions, but lack vitality. This is either because the composer has merely superficially replicated, actually plagiarized, the techniques and tonal language of classical music without placing the great task of embodying the images of our life before himself; or because for the composer, the traditional musical language is a means of appreciation, an image of the past, a stereotype, a departure from our reality.

    The reporter Khrennikov then cited Comrade Zhdanov's speech on the significance and progressive nature of the excellent traditions of classical music.

    Comrade Khrennikov said: We have not yet reached the qualities of classical musical art pointed out by Comrade Zhdanov. We are still unable to embody the thoughts and images of our era in a beautiful and complete form in the same way that the great classical composers of Russian music embodied the democratic and progressive thoughts of their era.

    Other Tendencies

    Comrade Khrennikov devoted a large part of his report to the evaluation of the works played at the plenary session, and used these concrete examples to expose the various basic tendencies that now exist in the creations of Soviet composers. He spoke of the dangers of looking back and the aesthetic attitude toward the past. In order to prove his point, the reporter cited Biriukov's symphonic work "Scenes of Old Kremlin", in which the author merely depicted a few insignificant small scenes of the past.

    Comrade Khrennikov said: It is precisely in conception and handling that composer Biriukov appears to be more conservative than our 19th-century classical composers.

    Although Zhordania’s violin concerto has several good characteristics, it cannot be considered a completely successful work, because it has bad, student-like imitations of several classical concerto music prototypes, and because it lacks a Ukrainian feel. Khachaturian's overture also left an unsatisfactory impression. In this overture, Rachmaninoff-style tones and images, sometimes even entire themes, obscured the contemporary world surrounding us.

    The most important issue for composers today is to be able to truthfully express the image of Soviet reality in our musical creations. Several works played at the plenary session aroused a fear that several composers have not solved the problem of the organic unity of modern content and its musical embodiment sufficiently deeply. In Chishko's ballad and sacred work "The National Flag Flies Over the Village Soviet" (set to music based on the poem by Alexei Nedogonov), although there are also true and moving interludes, the images of Soviet people often have a fabricated character, because the author passively borrowed the means and images of Russian classical opera. In the many song cycles of composer Rakov, the handling of Soviet images has a narrow, secluded, salon-like nature. The tonal atmosphere of Shapolin's song cycles set to the lyrics of Soviet poets is often a cycle of elegiac images, and these elegiac images are precisely what the audience is already familiar with from his song cycles set to the lyrics of Russian poets from the 19th and early 20th centuries.

    The reporter continued: I cannot elaborate here on several works that prove the existence of a tendency to depart from reality in our music or a tendency not to express reality truthfully and organically. I hope that other comrades will supplement my speech in the discussion and develop my ideas with concrete examples. I will now conclude this part of my report by citing a sentence from Comrade Zhdanov; Comrade Zhdanov said: "The people evaluate the talent of a musical work based on the extent to which it reflects the spirit of our era, the spirit of our people, and the extent to which it is close to the broad masses."

    Excellent Works

    The reporter said: I am very happy to point out the emergence of many talented new works written by young composers. Such as Arutiunian's "Ballad of the Motherland", this is a work with a profound patriotic spirit in its content, permeated with the youthful power of affirmation of life, and truthfully and organically expressing the image of our reality. The author has created a formally neat and moving work. This is not only an achievement of Armenian musical culture, but also our common achievement.

    Comrade Khrennikov also gave good reviews to Vainberg's "Little Symphony" and Amirov's "Azerbaijani Mugam". Although Comrade Khrennikov pointed out the dissonance in Bunin's symphony and the technical immaturity of Alekperov's symphony, he believed that there were still several good characteristics, just like Chipotaryan's piano prelude and Muravlev's "Russian Merry Tune".

    Khrennikov concluded: All these young people (and there are many other young composers who can be included in their ranks) who are not represented at the plenary session convince us that under the condition of paying close attention to their creations and paying attention to their educational work, this generation of composers will be able to participate gloriously in the construction of Soviet musical culture.

    The excellent works that should be included in the direction of realism also include works by several older generation composers: Velikanov's "Stalin Ballad", Dvarionas' and Kabalevsky's violin concertos, Shwartz's chorus "Negro Protest Song", Dankevich's "Monologue about Dan'ko", and Kasanov's piano concerto (the first major work of Tajik music). Several good characteristics in the first part of Meitus's clarinet concerto and in Karosas's violin sonata were also pointed out.

    New Creations by Criticized Composers

    When commenting on the creations of those composers pointed out by the resolution of the Central Committee of the Communist Party on February 10, 1948, as representatives of formalist tendencies, Comrade Khrennikov said that whether their creative reconstruction is successful depends on the extent to which each of these composers can review their ideological position and creative position with a spirit of ruthless self-criticism, and depends on the extent to which each of them deeply understands the most profound thoughts of the resolution of the Party Central Committee.

    It should be mentioned that Shostakovich's successful music for the film "The Young Guards" should be mentioned, and at the same time, the composer should be reminded that the Soviet public is waiting for him to write new works permeated with the spirit of realism and embodying the images of our real life.

    Khachaturian's symphony on Russian themes taken from Mayakovsky and the requiem symphony (excerpts from the music in the film), Shebalin's seventh quartet, Muradeli's Moscow ode and two choruses—all these works prove that these writers are willing to embark on the path of realistic musical creation.

    The reporter affirmed that, regrettably, it is impossible to form a more or less definite impression of Gavriil Popov's works during this period. A chorus by Popov played at the plenary session did not provide clear material for drawing any conclusions about his creative situation.

    The following common conclusion can be drawn about the works of the above-mentioned composers: With varying degrees of creative enthusiasm and creative success, their reconstruction process is still proceeding very slowly, and none of them has yet produced a work that, in terms of overall artistic value and expressiveness, is worthy of their level of talent.

    Our task is to do our best to assist these composers in completely embarking on the only correct creative direction indicated to us by the Party.

    Regarding Opera, Operetta, Ballet, Symphony

    Regardless of our achievements in other genres, the maturity and strength of Soviet music will be judged by this standard: the extent to which we can movingly and powerfully embody the good heroic images of our era in opera art—an art with great influence, democratic in nature, and realistic art.

    The resolution of the Central Committee of the Communist Party on February 10, 1948, dealt a fatal blow to the mockery of opera art cultivated over the centuries by modernists. The resolution determined the path of Soviet opera creation as a path of highly realistic art, where moving and melodious singing is the main and leading foundation, organically combined with other widely and richly developed components of opera art. And all of this should serve a basic task—revealing the inner and spiritual beauty of the heroes of the new socialist era. The Central Committee of the Party pointed out that our Soviet composers treated the great experience of classical, especially Russian classical, opera heritage with inexcusable nihilism, and here, the principles of realistic, truly humane art, and aesthetic beauty are generously embodied.

    Guided by the program put forward by the Central Committee of the Party, composers should bravely begin to create new operas, actively using excellent and advanced Soviet literary works as the basis for drama; Soviet literature is ahead of other arts in embodying the image of Soviet people.

    We should admit that the current scale and intensity of this work are completely insufficient. If composers can be blamed for lacking courage here, then our leaders should have such a crime: the lack of extensive and developed educational work, the method we are trying to use to solve the most important task of creating Soviet opera is cottage industry-like. Throughout the recent period, this task should become our main task, we should put all our strength here, and we should resolutely improve the organizational forms used to assist composers in creating operas, and these organizational forms are of great significance in this regard.

    The situation of Soviet operetta is slightly better. In this genre, there are successful works that have broken away from the nest of Western European bourgeois operetta. These operettas are: Dunaevsky's "Free Wind", Feltsman's "Air Fortress". Malyukin's "Restless Luck".

    The current task of operetta writers is to more bravely face the themes of Soviet reality and seek clear and at the same time realistically true musical language to depict positive heroes. Until now, this is still the biggest weakness of new operettas.

    The main reason for the backwardness of Soviet ballet should be considered the extreme immaturity of the script.

### 一九四八年苏联作曲家与音乐家的创作

专栏：

　　一九四八年苏联作曲家与音乐家的创作
    去年十二月二十一日至二十九日苏联作曲家协会理事会曾举行了第二次全体会议，检讨自联共中央“关于莫拉德里的歌剧‘伟大的友谊’决议”颁布后苏联作曲家和音乐家的创作情形。在会议上演奏了一百多个苏联作曲家的音乐作品。之后，全会并听取和讨论了该协会总书记赫连尼科夫的报告。这里所介绍的即赫氏报告的节要。小标题是译者所加的。　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　——编者
    在苏维埃音乐史上，一九四八年乃是我们整个音乐创作战线进行根本重建的一个时期。苏维埃作曲家在本年（指一九四八年——译者）一、二月间，获得了威力无可估计的理论武器。在反对艺术上形式主义曲解的斗争中，在争取我们的人民所亲近而了解的、美妙的、生活上真实的、社会主义时代的音乐的斗争中，强有力的党的思想在思想上武装了我们。
    有历史意义的文件：我们党中央委员会“关于Ｖ·莫拉德里的歌剧‘伟大的友情’”的决议及日丹诺夫同志在联共中央所召开的苏维埃音乐工作者会议上的发言，不仅帮助我们揭露了和谴责了苏维埃音乐中反人民的形式主义倾向，而且也指出了未来许多年的创作工作的战斗纲领。
    在党的这些指示的标帜下，我们于今年四月举行了全苏作曲家第一届代表大会。
    大会表明了苏联音乐创作力量在思想上的不可摧毁的团结，及作曲家与音乐学家力求于最短期间将我们党的指示体现于自己的创作中的热切的愿望。
    形式主义倾向
    我们最近十个月的创作生活究竟是怎样发展的？作曲家在创作中是否已能肃清党中央委员会的决议颁布前在苏维埃音乐中占统治地位的形式主义倾向呢？作曲家协会是否已能以现实主义方向的积极支持来帮助这一方向的作曲家扩大自己的阵地，并在我们的音乐艺术中占据统治地位呢？
    绝大多数作曲家已真诚地大力地走上了现实主义的道路。然而，在他们当中若干人的创作上，形式主义的现象还是存在的。普罗柯菲也夫的歌剧“一个真有的人的故事”，最明显地证明了这一点。该歌剧的音乐是极其形式主义化的，和波列伏伊的小说中的形象是万分矛盾的。这一歌剧在列宁格勒的基洛夫剧院上演时引起了苏维埃公众的愤怒和尖锐的抗议，乃是毫不足怪的。普罗柯菲也夫的这一歌剧的出现，证明西方现代派的传统在他的意识中是很强烈的，证明对于他来说，剧情的充分紧张及自然主义细节的惯用，比用音乐手段创造有有所为精神的、有强有力的肯定人生意志的苏维埃英雄人物的真实形象，尤为重要。这一方针便带来了音乐思想的目的性的缺乏。这首先表现为反旋律性和以枯燥的吟诵调为主；吟诵调只能表现歌词的外表上的生动性，而不能表现登场人物的内心。倘使普罗柯菲也夫较多地信任了集体的力量，在这一时期中不是脱离自己作曲家的组织的，倘使他没有将自己已作成的歌剧一直隐藏到上演之时才拿出来和公众见面，则同志们的及时的批评言论，可能而且大概就会帮助普罗柯菲也夫认识了他所选择的道路的罪恶性，检讨了独居生活中养成的观点，并获得了以那种有意义而重要的主题创作新歌剧的成绩。
    在音乐家之中，还有人不仅不和形式主义进行斗争，而且表示信奉自己旧时的形式主义的偶像。无疑地，音乐指挥海金是属于这一类人之中的。他在普罗柯菲也夫的新歌剧的全部历史上是起了真正决定命运的作用的。
    这些事实责成我们对创作中的形式主义的一切表现，及对音乐中形式主义倾向的一切辩解者要不停止进行最坚决的斗争。应该记住，形式主义并不永远是表现在这样明显的、攻势的形式中。有不少作品表面上好象是用现实主义的语言写作的，而实际上则是褪色的、贫血的、是没有生命的活力的。正是对这种表面上“无害”而实际上则更危险的形式主义形式，必须加以注意。我们这里有用俗话所说老好的语言写作的作品，这些作品站立在无条件尊重古典传统的立场，但没有生命力。这或是因为作曲家仅仅表面上复制了一下，实际上则抄袭了古典音乐的手法和有音调的语言，而没有将体现我们生活中的形象这一大任务放在自己面前；或是因为对于作曲家来说，传统的音乐语言乃是欣赏的手段，乃是过去的形象，乃是定型化，乃是离开我们的现实。
    报告人赫连尼科夫至此援引了日丹诺夫同志关于古典音乐优秀传统的意义及进步性的发言。
    赫连尼科夫同志说：我们现在还没有达到日丹诺夫同志所指出的那些古典音乐艺术的品质。我们还不会象俄罗斯音乐的伟大的古典作曲家体现了自己那一时代的民主进步思想一样地以美妙的、完整的形式体现我们时代的思想与形象。
    其它倾向
    赫连尼科夫同志以自己的报告的一大部分谈论了对全会上所演奏的作品的评价问题，并用这些具体的例子揭发了现在存在于苏维埃作曲家的创作中的种种基本倾向。他说到了回顾既往的情绪的危险性，说到了对过去的唯美主义的态度。为了证明自己的思想，报告人举出毕流科夫的交响曲作品“旧克里姆林宫的景色”为例，在该作品中，作者仅仅描绘了无关紧要的若干过去的小场面而已。
    赫连尼科夫同志说：正是在构想及其处理上，作曲家毕流科夫表现得比我们十九世纪的古典作曲家还保守些。
    若日捷斯温斯基的小提琴协奏曲虽然有若干好的特点，但不能因此便认为它是完全成功的作品，因为它有对于若干古典协奏曲音乐典型的不好的、学生式模仿的复制，因为它缺乏乌克兰情调。霍恰恩那托夫的序曲，也留下了令人不满意的印象。在该序曲中，拉赫玛尼诺夫派的音调和形象，有时候甚至整个主题，都遮蔽了我们周围的现世界。
    作曲家当前最重要的问题，乃是要会在我们的音乐创作中真实地表现苏维埃现实的形象。全会上所演奏的若干作品，引起了一种恐惧，便是恐惧若干作曲家没有足够深刻地解决现代内容与其音乐体现达到有机的统一的问题。在契史科的歌谣曲与圣乐作品“国旗飘扬在村苏维埃上”（根据阿列克塞·涅朵果诺夫的诗谱曲）中，虽然也有真实的动人的插曲，但苏维埃人们的形象往往具有伪造的性格，因为作者消极地借用了俄罗斯古典歌剧的手段和形象。在作曲家拉科夫的许多小诗乐中，苏维埃形象的处理具有狭隘地闭塞的、沙笼的性质。沙波林为苏维埃诗人的歌词配制的小诗乐的音调气氛，常常是哀歌形象的循环，而这些哀歌形象正是听众也还是从他为十九世纪及二十世纪初期俄罗斯诗人的歌词配制的小诗乐中听熟了的。
    报告人继称：我在这里不能再对若干证明在我们的音乐中存在着离开现实的倾向或不会真实地与有机地表现现实的倾向的作品加以细论了。我希望在讨论中会有其他同志补充我的发言，并用具体例子展开我的思想。我现在援引日丹诺夫同志的一句话来结束我的报告的这一部分；日丹诺夫同志说：“人民是看音乐作品反映我们时代的精神、我们人民的精神的程度如何，是看它接近广大群众的程度如何，借以评价它的才气如何的。”
    优秀作品
    报告人说：我很高兴来指出许多青年作曲家所写作的有才气的新作品的出现。如象阿鲁纠良的“祖国歌谣曲”，这是在内容上有深刻的爱国主义精神的、浸透了肯定人生的青春力的、真实地有机地表现我们现实的形象的作品。作者创作了形式整齐的、动人的作品。这不仅是亚美尼亚音乐文化的成绩，而且也是我们共同的成绩。
    赫连尼科夫同志对于瓦恩白格的“小交响乐”及阿米洛夫的“阿塞拜疆的蒙卡玛”，也给予了好评。赫连尼科夫同志虽然指出了布宁的交响乐中的不协调和阿列斯克洛夫的交响乐的技术上的不成熟，但认为也还有若干好的特点，正象契波塔利扬的钢琴前奏曲及蒙拉夫列夫的“俄罗斯欢乐曲”一样。
    赫连尼科夫总结道：全会上所没有代表的所有这些青年（还有不少别的青年作曲家也可以归入他们之列的）使我们确信：在切实注意他们的创作和注意对他们的教育工作的条件下，这一代作曲家是能够光荣地参加苏维埃音乐文化的建设的。
    应该归入现实主义方向的优秀作品之列的，也有较年长一代的若干作曲家的作品：维洛克的“斯大林歌谣曲”，德瓦里翁那斯及卡巴列夫斯基的小提琴协奏曲，史瓦列兹的轮唱曲“黑人的抗议歌”，丹克维奇的“关于丹娘的独白”，卡萨诺夫的钢琴协奏曲（塔吉斯坦的音乐的第一个大作品）。墨堆史的竖笛协奏曲的第一部份及卡洛萨斯的小提琴奏鸣曲两者中的若干好的特点，也都被指出了。
    受批评的作曲家的新创作
    评及一九四八年二月十日联共中央决议作为形式主义倾向的代表而指出的那些作曲家的创作时，赫连尼科夫同志说，他们在创作上的重建是否成功，决定于这些作曲家每一个人能否以无情的自我批评精神检讨自己的思想立场与创作立场的程度如何，决定于他们每一个人深刻领会党中央委员会决议的最深刻的思想的程度如何。
    应该举出萧斯塔可罗奇为影片“青年近卫军”配制的成功的音乐，同时并应该提醒该作曲家：苏维埃公众正在等待他写出浸透了现实主义精神的、体现我们现实生活的形象的新作品。
    哈恰杜里杨的取材于玛雅可夫斯基的俄罗斯的主题的交响乐与悼念列宁交响乐颂（摘自影片中的音乐），谢巴林的第七部四重奏，莫拉德里的莫斯科颂及两个合唱曲——这一切作品都证明了这些作家愿意走上现实主义的音乐创作的道路。
    报告人肯定说，遗憾得很，关于加夫利尔·波波夫这一期间内的作品不能形成或多或少确定的印象。全会上所演奏的波波夫的一个合唱曲，没有提出显明的材料以供作出关于他的创作情况的任何结论。
    对于上述各作曲家的作品可以作出这样一个共同的结论：在他们的创作积极性与创作成功的程度各各不同的情况下，他们的重建的过程仍然进行得很缓慢，他们之中至今没有一个人拿出就艺术上的全面价值及表现力说是够得上他们的天资水平的作品。
    我们的任务乃是极力协助这些作曲家完全走上党所指示给我们的唯一正确的创作方向。
    关于歌剧、小歌剧、舞剧、交响乐
    无论我们在其他体裁上的成绩如何，苏维埃音乐的成熟与否及力量如何，将是以这种标准来判断的：我们在歌剧艺术——具有巨大影响力的艺术，天性是民主主义的、现实主义的艺术——上能动人地有力地体现我们时代的好的英雄的形象的程度如何。
    一九四八年二月十日党中央委员会的决议，对于现代派对数世纪来所培养的歌剧艺术的嘲弄，给予了致命的打击。决议确定了苏维埃歌剧创作的道路为高度现实主义艺术的道路，在这里，动人的有旋律的歌唱，乃是主要的、领导的基础，是与其他广泛地丰富地发展了的歌剧艺术成份有机地结合的。而这一切应该为一项基本任务服务——显露新的社会主义时代的英雄的内心和心灵美。党中央委员会指出我们苏维埃作曲家以不可原谅的虚无主义态度对待古典的、特别是俄罗斯的古典的歌剧遗产的伟大经验，而在这里，现实主义的、真正人性的艺术的、美学上的美妙的原则，是极慷慨地被体现了的。
    以党中央委员会所提出的纲领为指南，作曲家应该勇敢地开始创作新的歌剧，积极地作为剧作基础而利用优秀的先进的苏维埃文学作品；苏维埃文学在体现苏维埃人的形象上是走在其他艺术的前面的。
    我们应该承认这一工作目前的规模与强度是完全不够的。假如在这里作曲家可以被非难为缺乏胆量，则我们领导者应该有这样的罪过：缺乏广泛展开了的教育工作，我们试图借以解决创作苏维埃歌剧这一最重要的大任务的方法是家庭手工业性的。在整个最近的时期，这一任务应该成为我们的主要任务，我们应该将我们的全部力量放在这里，我们并应该坚决地使借以协助作曲家创作歌剧的组织形式完善起来，这些组织形式在这方面是有很大的意义的。
    苏维埃的小歌剧的情况稍微较好。在这一体裁中，有摆脱了西欧资产阶级小歌剧的窝臼的成功的作品。这些小歌剧是：杜那也夫斯基的“自由的风”，菲尔兹曼的“空中堡垒”。玛流金的“不安的幸运”。
    小歌剧作家当前的任务是，更勇敢地面对苏维埃现实的主题，寻求明朗的、同时又是现实主义地真实的音乐语言来描绘积极的英雄。直到现在，还是新的小歌剧的最大的弱点。
    苏维埃舞剧之所以落后的主要原因，应该认为是脚本的极不成熟。
    （未完）
