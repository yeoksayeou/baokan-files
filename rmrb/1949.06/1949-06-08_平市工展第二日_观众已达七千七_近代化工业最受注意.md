　　Ping City Industrial Exhibition Second Day: Audience Reaches 7,700
  　Modern Industry Attracts Most Attention
    [Our Newspaper] The North China Industrial Products Exhibition was held yesterday (the 7th) for the second day. The audience, including the previous day, has reached more than 7,700 people. Visiting delegations from Jinzhou and Chahar also rushed to visit yesterday. Besides various agricultural machines, what people paid the most attention to were the belts, leather knots, and leather bowls made by the leather industry; and telephones, switchboards, radios, and wireless telephones made by the electrical industry. These industrial products were rare before liberation because they were squeezed out and destroyed by American goods. Now, only four months after liberation, not only have they been restored, but they have also been developed, so the audience was surprised.
    Secondly, visitors were very interested in the statistical charts and descriptions of various industrial sectors. For example, the output of 19 flour mills was 62,923 bags in February, 122,253 bags in March, 128,988 bags in April, and 135,900 bags in May. In addition, people saw various creations by engineers, technicians, and workers. For example, the bucket-type waterwheel made by a senior vocational school can draw 144 tons of water per day, and it is strong, leak-proof, and lightweight. The calcium carbide produced by Jianhua Battery Factory has a daily output of 60 tons, which can replace gasoline to start internal combustion engines.

　　平市工展第二日　观众已达七千七
  　近代化工业最受注意
    【本报讯】北平工业品展览会昨（七日）为第二日，观众连同前日已达七千七百余人。锦州、察哈尔等地参观团昨亦赶来参观。最被人们注意的，除了各种农业机器外，为制革业所制轮带、皮结、皮碗；电机业所制电话机、交换机、收音机、无线电话等。这些工业品在解放前是少见的，因为它们被美货排挤摧毁了。现在才解放四个月，不但恢复了，并且得到了发展，因此观众都感到惊奇。
    其次，参观者对各工业部门的统计图表和说明都感到极大兴趣。譬如十九家面粉厂，二月份产量为六万二千九百二十三袋，三月份为十二万二千二百五十三袋，四月份为十二万八千九百八十八袋，五月份十三万五千九百袋。此外，人们看到了工程师、技师、工人的各种创造。如高级职业学校所制水斗式水车，每日能抽水一百四十四吨，并且坚固、不漏水、轻便。建华电池厂所出电石日产量六十吨，能代替汽油发动内燃机。
