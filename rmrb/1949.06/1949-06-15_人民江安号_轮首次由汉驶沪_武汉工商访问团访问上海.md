Xinhua News Agency, Hankou, 14th: The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Jiang'an steamer sailed from Hankou to Shanghai for the first time on the 10th, carrying more than 700 passengers and over 500 tons of cargo, including tung oil and cotton. The steamer has been named "People's Jiang'an" by the Wuhan Military Control Commission. To celebrate the resumption of navigation between Shanghai and Hankou, the Wuhan Military Control Commission's Transportation Takeover Department held a resumption ceremony on the steamer before its departure, with Mayor Wu Defeng cutting the ribbon in person. When the White bandit Chongxi retreated, the Jiang'an steamer was towed away and hidden by employees of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, thus avoiding major damage. After the liberation of Wuhan, the employees of the steamer worked hard for seven days to repair it. The steamer has a gross tonnage of over 4,300 tons and a net tonnage of 2,000 tons. In the past, only the Sanbei Company's "Changhong" steamer had a larger tonnage. The Changhong steamer sank after hitting a reef in Zhenjiang last year.

Xinhua News Agency, Hankou, 14th: The Wuhan Industry and Commerce Delegation departed on the "People's Jiang'an" on the 10th for a visit to Shanghai. The purpose of this trip is to connect the economic relations between Wuhan and Shanghai and to attract Wuhan industrialists and businessmen who are staying in Shanghai and Hong Kong to return to Wuhan to invest. The delegation consists of 17 people, including Wang Yiming, factory director of Shengxin Flour Mill, Mao Bosheng, deputy manager of Huaxin Cement Plant, Xia Hechu, chairman of the Import and Export Trade Association, Cui Sigong, general manager of the Hankou branch of Shanghai Bank, and Chen Jingshe, former chairman of the Hankou Chamber of Commerce. It is divided into four groups: industry, commerce, finance, and transportation, with Chen Jingshe as the head of the delegation.

　　“人民江安号”轮首次由汉驶沪
  　武汉工商访问团访问上海
    【新华社汉口十四日电】招商局江安轮于十日首次由汉口驶往上海，载运旅客七百余人，桐油、棉花等货物五百余吨。该轮已由武汉军管会命名为“人民江安号”。武汉军管会交通接管部为庆贺沪汉复航，特于启碇前在该轮举行复航仪式，吴德峰市长亲临剪彩。江安轮于白匪崇禧溃逃时，曾经招商局员工拖走隐避，致未受重大破坏；在武汉解放后，又经该轮员工在七天内努力修复。该轮总吨位四千三百余吨，净吨位二千吨，过去只有三北公司的“长虹”轮比它吨位大。长虹轮已于去年在镇江触礁沉没。
    【新华社汉口十四日电】武汉市工商访问团于十日乘“人民江安号”首途访问上海。该团此行目的为沟通武汉和上海的经济关系，争取留上海和香港的武汉工商业家回武汉投资。该团由胜新面粉厂厂长王一鸣、华新水泥厂副经理茅伯笙、进出口同业公会理事长夏鹤雏、上海银行汉口分行总经理崔思恭、前汉口商会会长陈经畲等十七人组成，分为工业、商业、金融、交通四组，由陈经畲任团长。
