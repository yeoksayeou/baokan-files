Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 1st: TASS, Prague dispatch: The Ninth Congress of the Czechoslovak Communist Party, which opened on May 25, concluded on the 29th. At the final meeting on the 29th, the Congress heard reports on the revision of the Party Constitution by Svermova, Secretary of the Central Committee of the Czechoslovak Communist Party, and the special committee of the Congress. The Congress adopted the new Party Constitution. The Leninist-Stalinist organizational principles of party building became the foundation of the new Party Constitution.

The final meeting of the Congress elected the party's leading organs. The newly elected Central Committee consists of ninety-seven members and thirty-two alternate members. The Congress unanimously elected Gottwald as Chairman of the Czechoslovak Communist Party and Slánský as General Secretary. The election demonstrated the unity of the entire Czechoslovak Communist Party.

Before the close of the Congress, Malenkov, head of the CPSU delegation and Secretary of the CPSU Central Committee, was invited to speak. Malenkov said: The friendship between the peoples of Czechoslovakia and the Soviet Union is precious. May this friendship grow stronger, prosper, and endure forever! Long live the free, independent, and democratic Czechoslovak Republic! I wish the new Central Committee and Chairman Gottwald success in their work. Malenkov's words were frequently interrupted by cheers of "Long live Comrade Stalin! Long live the Soviet Union!"

According to the report of the Credentials Committee of the Congress, there were 2,068 official delegates to this Congress (of whom 1,274 were workers). Many delegates had experienced the birth, struggle, and victory of the Party. More than 700 delegates had been persecuted before the liberation of Czechoslovakia.

Within five days, this Congress received 48,000 congratulatory telegrams and 4,000 congratulatory letters from all over the country. This shows that the Czechoslovak Communist Party enjoys extremely high prestige among the people.

This Congress unanimously approved the political line of the Central Committee of the Czechoslovak Communist Party during the Eighth and Ninth Congresses, which is the general line of building socialism. This Congress had a detailed discussion and summary of the achievements of the fifteen months of work since the historic turning point of February 1948. Gottwald pointed out in his report that the economic and political foundations of the people's democratic regime had been expanded and consolidated during this period. The successful completion of the two-year economic plan and the start of the five-year plan have created a sound economic foundation for the establishment of socialism. In his speech, Gottwald outlined the tasks of the Czechoslovak Communist Party in socialist construction. The main organizational tasks put forward at the Congress were: it is necessary to maintain the purity of the party ranks with constant vigilance and eliminate bad elements within the party, improve the ideological and political level of party members, improve the efficiency of the party's administrative organs, and promote advanced elements to become party cadres and activists. Vigilance should also be heightened against the conspiracies of reactionary elements serving foreign spies. When discussing the five-year plan, the Congress emphasized that the greatest attention should be paid to improving labor efficiency, reducing production costs, saving raw materials, and improving the labor emulation movement. The Congress adopted an opinion that the Party should draw on the experience of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union in implementing the five-year plan and other aspects. The Party should mobilize all its forces to encourage trade unions and youth organizations to play a greater role.

　　捷共代表大会闭幕
  　通过新党章选出党中央　哥特瓦尔德当选中委会主席
    【新华社北平一日电】塔斯社布拉格讯：五月二十五日召开的捷共第九届代表大会，已于二十九日闭幕。在二十九日末次会议上，大会听取了捷共中央委员会书记斯维尔摩瓦和大会专门委员会所作的修改党章的报告。大会通过了新党章。列宁——斯大林建党的组织原则，成为捷共新党章的基础。
    大会末次会议选出了党的领导机构。新选出的中央委员会由九十七名委员和三十二名候补委员组成，大会并一致选举哥特瓦尔德为捷共主席，斯兰斯基为总书记。选举表示了捷共全党的团结。
    大会闭幕之前，联共代表团团长、联共中央书记马林可夫被邀讲演。马林可夫说：捷苏两国人民的友谊是可贵的。谨祝这个友谊壮大、隆盛和永存！自由独立民主的捷克斯洛伐克共和国万岁！祝新的中央委员会和哥特瓦尔德主席工作胜利。马林可夫的话句常为“斯大林同志万岁！苏联万岁！”的欢呼所中断。
    据大会资格审查委员会报告，这次大会有正式代表二千零六十八名（其中一千二百七十四人为工人）。很多的代表都是曾经历过党的诞生、斗争和胜利的。有七百多名代表在捷克斯洛伐克解放前受过迫害。
    这一次大会在五天之内，收到了来自全国各地的四万八千封贺电和四千封贺函。这说明了捷共在人民中享有极高的威信。
    这次大会一致批准了捷共第八届与第九届代表大会期间党中央委员会的政治路线，即建设社会主义的总路线。这次大会曾详细讨论与总结了自一九四八年二月历史性转折点以来的十五个月工作的成果。哥特瓦尔德在他的报告中曾指出这一时期人民民主政权的经济和政治基础是扩大和巩固了。两年经济计划的胜利完成和五年计划的开始，已为建立社会主义创造了健全的经济基础。哥特瓦尔德在他的演说中规划出了捷克斯洛伐克共产党在社会主义建设中的任务。大会中提出的主要组织任务是；必须以经常的警觉来保持党的队伍的纯洁性和清除党内不良分子，提高党员的思想和政治水平，提高党的行政机构的效率，提拔先进分子成为党的干部和积极分子。对于为外国间谍服务的反动分子的阴谋，也应提高警惕性。大会在讨论五年计划时着重指出：对提高劳动效率，减低生产成本，节约原料和改进劳动竞赛运动，都要给以最大的注意。大会采纳一项意见，认为党在实行五年计划以及其他方面应当吸取苏联共产党的经验。党应当动员它的一切力量，鼓舞职工会与青年团体发挥更大的积极性。
