Xinhua News Agency, Peiping, 28th: The Central Committee of the China New Democratic Youth League's organ, "China Youth," published a short commentary in its ninth issue entitled "Summer Vacation is Coming," calling on students and Youth League members to pay attention to summer vacation work.

The short commentary said: "Our students' task is to study, and they should also review and consolidate their lessons during the holidays. Especially students in newly liberated areas, because the content of school courses cannot be reformed quickly, they should organize various forms of learning during the summer vacation. They should study historical materialism, the basic issues of the Chinese revolution, and various policies of the New Democracy. New Democratic Youth League members should play an exemplary role in these studies, and they should be good at guiding students to transform their thinking and establish a revolutionary outlook on life. In order to make learning effective, it is necessary to organize various training classes, study groups, and reading groups under the leadership and assistance of educational institutions, school administrations, local Youth League committees, student federations, and student associations. School Youth Leagues, student federations, student associations, etc. must also summarize their work well, synthesize and analyze students' opinions on reforming the education system and transforming learning, and put forward more systematic opinions for educational institutions or school administrations to adopt."

The short commentary hopes that students will not miss any opportunity to directly participate in labor during the summer vacation to change their views of despising labor; and calls on local Youth Leagues and student federations to appropriately organize this work. Regarding visiting factories and rural areas during the summer vacation, the short commentary said: "This is also very good. However, local student federations need to carry out this work in a planned manner, so as not to hinder their production when they go to factories and rural areas."

The short commentary concluded: "Youth League members must attach importance to the importance of summer vacation work, unite the vast number of students, strengthen the study of New Democracy, study Mao Zedong, and develop good study habits, so that when school starts in the autumn, they can become model students with excellent character and learning."

　　“中国青年”发表短评
  　号召学生利用暑假组织学习参加劳动
    【新华社北平二十八日电】中国新民主主义青年团中央委员会的机关刊“中国青年”第九期，发表题为“暑假快到了”的短评，号召学生和青年团团员们，重视暑假工作。
    短评说：“我们学生的任务在学习，在假期中也应该补习与温习功课。特别是新解放区的同学，由于学校的课程内容还不可能很快地改革好，更要在暑期中组织种种学习。学习唯物史观、中国革命的基本问题和新民主主义的各种政策。新民主主义青年团团员要在这些学习中起模范作用，要善于引导同学们在这些学习中改造思想，建立革命的人生观。为了使学习能够有效地进行，在教育机关、学校行政、各地青年团团委、学联、学生会的领导与帮助之下，组织各种训练班、学习班以及读书会等，是必要的。学校青年团、学联、学生会等并须很好地总结工作，将同学们对改革学制与改造学习的意见加以综合与分析，提出较有系统的意见，供教育机关或学校行政采纳”。
    短评希望学生们在暑假中不放松一切机会直接参加劳动，来改变轻视劳动的观点；并号召各地青年团、学联，适当地组织这一工作。关于暑假中参观工厂、访问农村，短评说：“这也是很好的。但是，需要各地学联有计划地进行这一工作，以免到工厂农村里，反而妨碍他们的生产”。
    短评最后说：“青年团员们，必须重视暑假工作的重要性，团结广大同学，加强学习新民主主义，学习毛泽东，养成良好的学习习惯，使得在秋后上学时，成为品学兼优的模范学生”。
