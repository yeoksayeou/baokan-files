    The deterioration of the American economic situation has been increasingly revealed by American business figures. Now, even representatives of monopoly capital, such as Raynes, the vice president of the banking trust company controlled by the Morgan Group, recently admitted that "the post-war prosperity ended in the second half of 1948, and the productivity in the past six months has been declining continuously. I believe this downward trend will continue." Due to the deterioration of the economic situation, various capitalist groups in the United States have different interests, and their internal disputes and attacks have also occurred. At present, some senators insist on cutting the second phase of the Marshall Plan appropriation by about ten billion US dollars and reducing government expenditures by twenty to forty billion US dollars. Some Republican senators, taking advantage of the deterioration of the economic situation, seize the opportunity to attack the incompetence of the Democratic government in an attempt to reserve capital for future elections. U.S. President Truman, on the other hand, advocates accelerating the implementation of foreign aggression plans. In his speech in Little Rock, he urged Congress to quickly approve the North Atlantic Treaty, opposed cutting the second phase of the Marshall Plan appropriation, announced the implementation of the "Development of Backward Areas Plan," and insisted on completely abolishing "special tariff barriers," etc. Although there have been and will be many "life-saving prescriptions," the increasingly deteriorating American economic situation, due to its development according to the inherent laws of capitalism, cannot be alleviated. Therefore, whether it is Truman's "plan" or any senator's "plan," it will be of no avail.

    美经济情势恶化内部争吵不休
    美国经济情势的恶化，已经更多地从美国企业界人士的口中透露出来。现在，甚至独占资本的代表，象摩根集团控制下的银行业信托公司的副总裁雷埃森，也于最近承认“战后繁荣在一九四八年后半年已告终止，而过去六个月的生产率，也不断地下降，我相信，这种下降的趋势是要继续下去的”。由于经济情势的恶化，美国各资本集团因为利害不同，他们内部的争吵和攻讦也随之发生。目前，一部分参议员坚持要把马歇尔计划第二期拨款削减十亿美元左右，并将政府支出减少二十至四十亿美元。一部分共和党参议员，借经济情势的恶化，趁机攻讦民主党政府的无能，企图为未来选举预储资本。美总统杜鲁门，则主张加速推行对外侵略计划，他在小石城发表的演说中，敦促国会迅速批准北大西洋公约，反对削减马歇尔计划第二期拨款，宣布要推行“开发落后地区计划”，并坚主全部撤消“特殊的关税障碍”等。虽然已经有而且将来还会有很多很多的“救命药方”，但是，日益恶化的美国经济情势，由于它是按照资本主义的内在规律发展，这是无法可以缓和的，因此，不论是杜鲁门的“计划”也好，或者是任何一个参议员的“计划”也好，都将无济于事。
