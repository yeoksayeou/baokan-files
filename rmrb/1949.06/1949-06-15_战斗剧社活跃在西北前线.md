　　The Combat Drama Troupe is Active on the Northwest Front
　　Lin Yang
　　　　　(1) Performances Coordinated with Practicality
　　Before the First Field Army's Combat Drama Troupe performs for a unit, they first ask the unit leader to introduce the ideological education situation. Based on the current local issues, the comrades involved in creation immediately go to the lower levels of platoons, squads, and companies to collect materials and quickly write short plays, lyrics, and ditties to coordinate with the unit's work. For example, in the Liberation Regiment of the Independent First Brigade, to coordinate with the regiment's bitterness education, they collected materials, wrote, rehearsed, and performed the small Yangko opera "Qin Deming's Bitterness" in just one and a half days. In the Liberation Brigade, they used Henan clapper talk and drums to sing about the typical bitterness of "Li Huacheng" and "Zhang Deming," which promoted the unit's bitterness movement. When performing for the 771st Regiment of the New Fourth Brigade, they used ditties to sing about their heroic struggle behind enemy lines in southern Hebei during the Anti-Japanese War. In the 7th Regiment of the 359th Brigade, they sang about their production in "Northern Shaanxi's Jiangnan - Nanniwan," and their great southern expedition during the Anti-Japanese War... After singing about the glorious traditions and combat style of these units in history, political cadres immediately organized soldiers to hold discussions. New and old soldiers alike felt immensely honored to be members of these units. This improved their ideological understanding and encouraged the heroic spirit of performing meritorious service for the people. When performing for the 8th Regiment of the 359th Brigade, the troupe used fast-clappers to sing about the heroes and combat achievements in their victorious annihilation of the enemy after their triumphant return from the counterattack in Huanglong Mountain. In the Second Column Field Hospital, they praised the model nurses and recuperating soldiers there... This kind of small-scale creation and singing, due to the shortness of time (a few hours to half a day at most), was inevitably a bit rough. But because it was combined with the current local reality, and performed or sung in a form familiar to the masses, it was warmly welcomed by the majority of soldiers and cadres. Instructor Li of the Second Column said: "Your little plays and songs are just like our instructors giving dozens of political lessons...".
　　In addition to the above programs, they also performed "Heroine Liu Hulan" (a new opera in five acts and thirteen scenes), which portrays the great integrity of Communist Party members; "Heroes of Jiugushan" (a drama in five acts and nine scenes), which portrays the heroic, resourceful, and tenacious combat style of the People's Liberation Army in the defense of Yan'an and the blocking war; and "I'm Back in the Eighth Route Army," "Family Letter," as well as a medley of military songs, a medley of folk songs, and a victory march. These programs were well received by the audience, especially "Heroine Liu Hulan," which was widely welcomed by the majority of soldiers and cadres. For example, after watching the play, the 771st Regiment of the Independent Fourth Brigade, each battalion, company, platoon, and even individual comrades, wrote twenty or thirty letters to the drama troupe. The letter from the entire machine gun company said: "The comrades all spontaneously associated themselves with Liu Hulan, examined their shortcomings, and unanimously called for revenge for Liu Hulan." (excerpt from the original letter) After watching the play, the Second Brigade passed a resolution to "Avenge Liu Hulan" (published in the Jin Sui Daily). Soldiers of the First Column even formed a "Revenge for Liu Hulan Group"... etc.; "Heroes of Jiugushan" was also welcomed by the majority of soldiers and cadres. After watching the play, soldiers of the 7th and 9th Regiments of the 359th Brigade reviewed their determination and mutual assistance in combat, and cadres of platoons and squads reviewed their leadership style. Everyone discussed learning from Squad Leader Li in the play... Section Chief Wu of ×× Department, analyzed the reasons why the play had such an effect, saying: "Why is this play welcomed by the soldiers? Because it portrays the heroic, resourceful, and tenacious combat style of the People's Liberation Army, which is precisely the direction of learning for the troops today..."
　　　　(2) Poems on the Marching Roadside
　　The drama troupe followed the troops to carry out combat missions, and all comrades were dispersed to various regiments to assist in political work. On the march, everyone rushed to carry machine guns, mortars, ammunition, and marching pots for the soldiers. To coordinate with the political work during the march, the working group of the Ninth Regiment launched the "Poems on the Marching Roadside" activity. The comrades, like the troops, marched eighty or ninety miles every day. After the troops camped and rested, everyone disregarded their fatigue and held meetings with military and political cadres late into the night to study the problems that occurred during the day's march and the problems that might occur tomorrow, and wrote accordingly. Before the troops set off the next day, they walked ahead and wrote large-character poems at the springs where they estimated the soldiers would drink cold water, and weighed the paper down with stones: "Drink less cold water to avoid getting sick, drinking cold water will cause a stomachache." Sometimes problems were discovered on the road, and poems were written on the roadside temporarily. For example, on the way to Shibao Town, seeing that some soldiers were not careful and scattered millet, they wrote such a poem in that place: "People are iron, food is steel, everyone should save millet, this is the blood and sweat of the people, to let us eat and win battles." When the troops reached the foot of the mountain, there was such a poem at the intersection: "This mountain is not too big, everyone add oil to climb up, those who walk in front take a plane, those who fall behind carry a tortoise." When the soldiers saw this, they roared enthusiastically to each other: "Don't be a tortoise!" Everyone climbed over the mountain and continued to move towards their destination in this cheerful and active mood.
　　　　(3) "Singing Heroes" in Combat
　　Before the battle was arranged, male and female comrades of the drama troupe, taking the brigade's directly subordinate units and various regiments as units, appropriately allocated drama, music, and creative talents to form working groups, which went to the companies to use small-scale literary and artistic activities of "singing heroes" to cooperate with the political mobilization before the battle. For example, in the autumn of last year, just when our large army was attacking Taiyuan, Hu Zongnan airlifted ammunition and supplies to Yan Xishan, and drew four divisions of troops (the 36th Division was the main force among them), vainly trying to cross the Yellow River and go to southern Shanxi to aid Taiyuan. Our army launched a counterattack in Huanglong Mountain. At the mobilization meeting for the battle of the 359th Brigade, the drama troupe used the tune of the Southern Little Sister to sing "Eliminate the 36th Division," the content was: "(1) Yan Xishan is about to be finished, and asks Lao Jiang to reinforce him, the 36th Division is coming! Oh, it's going to Huanglong Mountain. (2) Our Commander Peng (the soldiers' affectionate name for Deputy Commander Peng) has high plans, the net is well arranged, catching turtles in a jar, oh, it's guaranteed not to escape...". The female comrades of the drama troupe working in the brigade headquarters, after the brigade leader made a combat mobilization report, sang songs about how the brigade's telephone platoon and communications platoon should cooperate in the task of annihilating the enemy.
　　In Juluobao in northern Shanxi and Huanglong Mountain in northern Shaanxi, due to guerrilla warfare, the troops were waiting for the enemy in the trenches. The drama troupe used the form of "singing heroes" to go to the mountains to sing for the soldiers, cooperating with the political work on the battlefield at that time. They also selected short and concise Yangko operas to perform in the more concealed places behind the fortifications to comfort the soldiers' fatigue.
　　When the battle started, they went to work in the trenches and bunkers. For example, during the Datong battle, the working group of the 358th Brigade, and several comrades from the brigade, organized a small battlefield propaganda team of eleven or twelve people, active on the front lines, singing to praise the deeds of the heroes and introduce combat experience. The soldiers warmly welcomed this kind of singing in the trenches, and intimately held the hands of the comrades of the drama troupe, asking them to sing again or teach them. When the performance officially ended, a brief battlefield mobilization was also carried out. The soldiers always expressed like this: "...To thank the comrades for their condolences, we will respond to you by resolutely completing the combat mission..."
　　This kind of small-scale literary and artistic activity of "singing heroes" can be carried out anytime and anywhere (before and after various meetings, roll call, games, during marching breaks, etc.), from the regiment or battalion as a unit. For example, in the Eighth Regiment, to cooperate with the regiment's celebration meeting, six comrades from the drama troupe organized an evening party to sing about heroes and models, and used Henan clapper talk, drums, fast-clappers, and folk tunes to sing about the deeds of special combat hero Chen Zhide and more than a dozen other meritorious personnel. As small as a squad or several people as the target, they wrote lyrics and sang at any time according to the materials of the squad. Sometimes the soldiers also composed and sang. For example, the soldiers of the 718th Regiment could all compose and sing about the heroes and models in their company. The quartermaster of this company, who was in charge of food, had been selected as a model three times in two years, and was universally respected by the soldiers and cadres, so they composed a song to sing about him: "Comrades! Listen to me, there is a quartermaster in the Third Battalion machine gun company, his name is Liu Mei, nicknamed Old Quartermaster, he makes the food really delicious..." When the cooks heard the soldiers' praise for the quartermaster and the food, everyone smiled and worked harder.

　　战斗剧社活跃在西北前线
    林杨
  　　　　　（一）配合实际的演出
    第一野战军战斗剧社每到一个部队演出前，先请该单位首长做思想教育情况的介绍。根据当时当地的问题，搞创作的同志，就马上有计划的到班、排、连下层去搜集材料，赶写小戏、唱词、小调，以便配合该单位的工作。如在独一旅解放团，为了配合该团的诉苦教育，连搜集材料到写作排演，一天半中就演出了小秧歌剧“秦德明的诉苦”；在解放旅则用河南坠子、大鼓、演唱了诉苦典型“李华成”“张德明”，这些都推动了该单位的诉苦运动。在新四旅七七一团演出时，就用小调歌唱他们抗日时期在冀南坚持敌后英勇斗争的历史，在三五九旅七团，就歌唱他们开辟“陕北江南——南泥湾”的生产，歌唱他们抗日战争中伟大的南征……当把这些部队历史上的光荣传统，和战斗作风演唱以后，政治干部马上组织战士开讨论会，新老战士都以自己是这部队的一员，而感到无上的光荣，这样提高了思想认识，鼓励了为人民立功的英雄气概。在三五九旅八团演出时，正遇部队由黄龙山丽反击战后胜利归来，剧社就用快板，演唱他们胜利歼敌中的英雄和战斗功绩。在二纵队野战医院，就表扬那里的模范护士和休养员……这种小型创作和演唱，由于时间的短促（几个钟头最多半天）不免有点粗糙，但因为和当时当地的实际结合了，又是以群众熟悉的形式演或唱，所以得到了广大战士干部的热烈欢迎，二纵队李教导员说：“你们的这些小戏和演唱，和我们指导员上几十次政治课一样……”。
    除以上节目外，并演出表现共产党员伟大气节的“女英雄刘胡兰”（五幕十三场新歌剧），表现保卫延安阻击战中，解放军英勇机智顽强战斗作风的“九股山的英雄”（五幕九场话剧），和“我又回到八路军”、“家信”，及军歌联奏、民歌联奏、胜利进行曲等。这些节目颇得观众好评，尤其“女英雄刘胡兰”受到广大战士干部的普遍欢迎，如独四旅七七一团看戏后，各营连排班以至个别同志，给剧社写了二三十封信，其中机炮连全体的信上说：“同志们都自发的联系起刘胡兰，检讨自己的缺点，大家一致的呼声，要为刘胡兰报仇。”（摘原信）二旅看戏后并通过了一个“为刘胡兰报仇”的决议（载于晋绥日报），一纵战士并成立了“为刘胡兰报仇小组”……等；“九股山的英雄”也受到广大战士干部的欢迎，三五九旅七团九团战士看戏后，联系自己检讨战斗中的决心和互助，班排干部检讨自己领导作风，大家讨论要学习戏中李班长……。××部吴科长，分析这戏引起这样效果的原因说：“这个戏为什么受到战士的欢迎呢？因为他表现了解放军的英雄、机智，顽强的战斗作风，这些正是今天部队学习的方向………”
    　　　　（二）行军路边诗
    戏社跟随部队，执行战斗任务，全体同志分散到各团，帮助政治工作。大家在行军中，抢着为战士扛机枪，背迫击炮，扛弹药，挑行军锅等。为了配合行军中的政治工作，九团的工作小组，开展了“行军路边诗”的活动。同志们和部队一样，每天行军八九十里，队伍宿营休息了，大家还不顾疲劳，连夜和军政干部开会，研究当天行军中及明天可能发生的问题，根据这些来进行写作。第二天队伍还未出发，他们就在前面走了，走到那估计战士们要喝冷水的水泉边，就用石头压住一张大纸，上写着大字的诗歌：“少喝冷水少生病，喝了冷水肚子疼”。有时路上发现问题，临时就在路旁写作，如往石堡镇途中，见有个别战士，不注意抛撒了小米，就在那地方写了这样的诗：“人是铁饭是钢，大家保存好米粮，这是人民的血和汗，叫咱吃了打胜仗。”当部队走到大山脚下，在路口就有这样的诗：“这个山不算大，大家加油往上爬，走在前头坐飞机，落在后边背王八。”战士们见了，就互相热烈的吼喊起来：“不要当王八呀！”大家在这种愉快活跃的情绪下，爬过了大山，向目的地继续前进。
    　　　　（三）战斗中“唱英雄”
    布置战斗前，剧社男女同志，以旅直属队和各团为单位，适当配备戏剧、音乐、创作人材，组成工作小组，分赴连队，用“唱英雄”的小型文艺活动，配合战斗前的政治动员。如去年秋天，正值我大军团攻太原，胡宗南一面空运弹药、给养给阎锡山，一面抽出四个师的兵力（三十六师是其中主力师），妄想渡黄河，经晋南去援助太原，我军就在黄龙山丽，展开了反击战，剧社在三五九旅的战斗动员的大会上，用南方小探妹调，唱出了“消灭三十六师”，内容是：（一）阎锡山眼看要完蛋，要求老蒋来增援，来了三十六师呀！哎哟，要进黄龙山。（二）咱们彭老总（战士们对彭副总司令亲敬的称呼）计划高，天罗地网安排好，瓮中捉王八呀，哎哟，保险跑不了……。”在旅直工作的剧社女同志，当旅首长作战斗动员报告后，唱出了旅部电话排、通讯排应该如何配合歼敌任务的歌曲。
    在晋北俱洛堡和陕北黄龙山中，由于打游击战，部队在战壕里等待敌人，剧社就用“唱英雄”形式，到山头去为战士演唱，配合当时战场政治工作，并排选短小精悍的秧歌剧，到工事后边较隐蔽的地方演出，慰问战士们的劳累。
    战斗打响了，就到战壕里和堡垒中去工作。如大同战役时，在三五八旅的工作小组，和旅上几个同志，组织起小型战地宣传队，十一二个人活跃在火线上，用歌唱表扬英雄们的事迹，介绍战斗经验。战士们对这种战士战壕演唱，表示了热烈的欢迎，亲密地拉着剧社同志的手，要求再唱或教给他们。当演唱正式结束时，还进行简短的战场鼓动，战士们总是这样表示：“……为了多谢同志们的慰问，我们用坚决完成战斗任务来回答你们……。”
    这种“唱英雄”的小型文艺活动，可以随时随地的展开（在各种会议前后，点名，游戏，行军休息中均可进行），大至以团营为单位，如在八团，为了配合团的庆功大会，剧社六个同志组织了歌唱英雄模范晚会，用河南坠子、大鼓、快板、民间小调演唱了特等战斗英雄陈志德等十几个功臣的事绩。小至以班排或几个人为对象，随时根据班排材料写词演唱。有时战士也编唱起来，如七一八团战士，都会编唱自己连里的英雄模范，这个连搞伙食的事务长，两年内曾选为三次模范，受战士干部普遍的敬爱，就把他编歌来唱：“同志们！细听我来讲，三营机炮连有一个事务长，他的名字叫刘美，外号老事务长，伙食搞得真漂亮……”炊事员同志们，听到战士对事务长和伙食的赞美，大家笑迷迷的工作得更起劲了。
