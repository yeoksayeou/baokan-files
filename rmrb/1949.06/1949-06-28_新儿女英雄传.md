    Chapter 14: The Mystery of Marriage (Continued 2)
    Five

    On that day, eighteen-year-old Niu Xiaoshui dressed up as the bride: wearing a wig, a floral satin cheongsam, pink socks, medium-heeled leather shoes, with rouge and powder, looking quite handsome; a red silk scarf covered his head, and a small handgun was hidden in his waist. Sister Chen, who came to help with the work, volunteered to be the bridesmaid, also dressed very lavishly. Rice Chief Mi from Danyang Village pretended to be the bride's cousin, wearing a brand-new long gown and mandarin jacket, with a black satin cap. Four armed comrades from the county brigade were also disguised as relatives. These six people all had guns in their pockets. Other comrades had other tasks and had already set off. In the afternoon, the wedding boat here also set off.

    As the boat approached Xie Liu Village, the newly appointed village chief Wang Fuhai had already prepared a bridal sedan chair, two small sedan chairs, four bandsmen, along with some Japanese soldiers and a group of puppet troops, waiting on the embankment. The puppet soldiers guarding the watchtower on the embankment all ran out to watch. Not far away on the water, some villagers were paddling "yingpaizi" boats to release "cormorants." They heard a "woo--err" sound, and a number of cormorants flew up with a whoosh, spinning around in the air, and then diving into the water to catch fish.

    As the boat docked, Wang Fuhai nodded to Mi Mancang and said, "Mr. Mi, you're here!" Rice Chief Mi also greeted him with a smile. A group of people went ashore. Sister Chen helped the bride into the bridal sedan chair. She and Rice Chief Mi both sat in the small sedan chairs. The bandsmen began to play, and they entered the village with guards in front and behind. From East Street to West Street, they could see the Japanese flag hanging on the watchtower in the west of the village. At the entrance of the village, a group of laborers were repairing the road. On West Street, outside the temporary residence of the Japanese squad leader, it was very lively, with people selling cigarettes, selling Yali pears, selling candied haws... and some idlers watching the fun. Two Japanese soldiers stood guard at the door.

    As the sedan chair stopped, two Japanese men accompanied Fanno to greet them. That day, Fanno, who was short and fat, wore a black suit; the snow-white stiff collar set off his bulbous nose, making it look even redder. He grinned, welcoming the group to the living room. Many Japanese soldiers crowded around, wanting to see the bride. Rice Chief Mi quickly stopped them, smiling and saying, "Sir, according to Chinese customs, you can't lift the veil!" Wang Fuhai introduced to the Japanese: "This is the bride's cousin." Sister Chen hurriedly helped the bride into the bridal chamber.

    Niu Xiaoshui wasn't used to wearing high heels, and with a silk scarf on his head, he tripped on the threshold and almost fell. Sister Chen quickly helped him, breaking out in a cold sweat.

    The bridal chamber was decorated lavishly: a steel spring bed, a pink curtain, a large glass mirror, a recliner.... The bride sat on the edge of the bed, and the room was crowded with Japanese people. Sister Chen said, "You all go out! The bride is shy." The Japanese all looked and laughed. Rice Chief Mi smiled and pushed them out: "Everyone out of the way, everyone out of the way!"

    It was already getting dark. A feast was set up outside. The men all went to the living room. A large gas lamp hung in the living room, the light so white it was almost blue, and dazzlingly bright. Squad Leader Fanno invited the bride's cousin to take the seat of honor, but Rice Chief Mi said, "The Sir should take the seat of honor!" Fanno smiled and said, "You take the seat of honor!" Everyone in the living room either offered a seat or laughed. Each table was filled with chicken, duck, fish, and meat, wine bottles, and wine glasses.

    Rice Chief Mi and his four comrades were at the same table as Fanno and Wang Fuhai. Rice Chief Mi smiled and said, "When marrying a Chinese person, you must follow Chinese customs, everyone drink more!" Squad Leader Fanno was so happy that his nose and eyes squeezed together, and he picked up a large glass of wine and gulped it down. Wang Fuhai kept pouring him wine. Others were also encouraging and drinking. Those serving ran back and forth, opening bottles of Sun brand beer one after another, and sending them to each table. In the side rooms, the voices of those puppet army small leaders playing finger-guessing games could be heard.

    After drinking for a while, the Japanese got into the spirit, and all picked up bottles and poured them into their mouths. Each one of them drank into an ugly monster. One Japanese man, the one with the "dog teeth marks," his white face flushed red, raised his small glasses, stood up, took off his military uniform, wearing only a floral striped shirt, and started dancing in the middle of the living room; a cloth-sewn doll hanging from his waist also jumped up and down. Those glasses slid to the tip of his nose, his eyes rolling comically above the eyeglass frames, making various funny faces. As he danced, he sang. Many Japanese people tapped their wine glasses and bottles with their chopsticks to keep time, and also sang along.

    Later, some clapped their hands, some shook their heads, singing, laughing, and shouting chaotically. The tables were a mess, many plates and bowls falling to the ground and breaking... it was really getting out of hand! The comrades, watching the enemy's madness, felt itchy with hatred in their hearts.

    Six

    Wang Fuhai's wife was also helping in the kitchen. She brought rice to the bride. Sister Chen and Xiaoshui ate some hastily and asked them to take the rice away. Sister Chen dimmed the kerosene lamp a little and whispered to Xiaoshui, "It's almost time, you must stay calm and don't give yourself away!" Xiaoshui whispered, "You guys keep a good eye on things outside! Don't let me screw things up. If things go wrong, don't leave me and run away!" Sister Chen smiled and said, "How could that be! As long as you succeed, there won't be any problems outside."

    After a while, two Japanese soldiers supported the squad leader in, helping him to sit in the recliner next to the bed. The two Japanese soldiers grinned and went out. Sister Chen also hurried out, closing the door behind her. Xiaoshui sat sideways on the edge of the bed, with his head down. The sound of opera singing from the radio could be heard in the living room.

    Squad Leader Fanno leaned back drunkenly, his eyes squinting with a smile, greedily staring at the back of the bride. He smoked half a cigarette, then threw away the cigarette butt, patted the chair and said, "Come, come, come! Sit here!" Xiaoshui's heart was pounding, but he didn't say a word. Fanno thought the bride was shy, pursed his red nose, revealed a mouthful of yellow teeth, giggled, and reached out to pull him. Xiaoshui dodged and climbed onto the bed, secretly taking out his gun. Fanno got up unsteadily, with a lascivious face, and pulled on his leg. Xiaoshui turned around and fired a shot, missing. Fanno was stunned, and Xiaoshui fired two more shots, killing him.

    As soon as the gunshot rang out in the bridal chamber, the comrades in the living room immediately drew their guns, overturned the tables, and shot at those with guns first. The Japanese didn't have time to draw their guns and were shot dead on the ground. The living room was in chaos for a moment. The comrades blocked the door, shooting and shouting, "Surrender and you won't be killed!" In the courtyard, many people jumped down from the wall, all of whom were the county and district armed forces who had been ambushed in advance. Some ran to the living room, some ran to the side rooms. The two Japanese soldiers who were guarding the gate heard the fighting inside, picked up their guns and ran inside. Suddenly, several gunshots rang out from behind, and the two guards fell. Those village cadres dressed as vendors, all rushed inside with guns. At this time, the moon hadn't come up yet, and it was very dark. The "villagers" on the yingpaizi boats by the Dian in the east of the village, heard the first gunshot and took out their guns and went ashore; in the west of the village, the "laborers" resting in the large temple also ran out with their guns; these were all the district squad and the militia secretly organized in the village. Hei Lao Cai had already made contact with some of the puppet soldiers on the watchtower, and at this time, they cooperated from inside and outside, and took down all two watchtowers without firing a single shot.

    After a while, the gunshots in the mansion stopped. Those puppet army small leaders in the side rooms had all been educated by Hei Lao Cai. As soon as they saw that the Eighth Route Army had succeeded, they smoothly surrendered their guns. The Japanese in the living room, either died or were wounded; some knelt on the ground begging for mercy, some hid under the tables and were dragged out; some smashed the glass windows and wanted to escape, but were also captured alive. The hall was a complete mess, vases shattered, dishes and bowls scattered, tables, chairs, and benches overturned, military flags and playing cards scattered all over the ground...

    The comrades were busy searching for weapons. Niu Xiaoshui fought for a while, and his wig had long since fallen off, revealing his small bald head; he had also lost a shoe, and his pink socks were running around on the ground. He saw a clothes rack standing in the corner of the wall, with a yellow wool coat hanging on it. He was overjoyed and hurriedly took off his floral satin cheongsam and went to get the coat, but he didn't expect the coat to be moving and grunting on its own. Xiaoshui was startled, and used the butt of his gun to lift up the coat, revealing a Japanese man hiding inside, hugging the pole of the clothes rack like a monkey climbing a pole, shivering. Xiaoshui shouted, "Get down!" The Japanese man was so scared that he fell to the ground with the clothes rack and the man, Xiaoshui quickly pinned him down; Rice Chief Mi ran over to take a look, and it turned out to be the "dog teeth marks" who was dancing, and he was also captured alive.

    The streets were noisy. The men, women, old and young in the village, all ran to the watchtower. They held torches, carrying iron picks, hoes, baskets, carrying poles... and started tearing down the watchtower together. The wood, bricks, and tiles that were torn down were all taken home. In just one night, both large watchtowers were leveled to the ground.

    Seven

    The victory at Xieli Village further shook the puppet troops in nearby villages. Our cadres and the common people all said: "Strike while the iron is hot, and wipe out all the remaining watchtowers!"

    On this day, Yang Xiaomei mobilized all the unions, farmers' associations, youth associations, women's associations, and children's groups in Shenjia Village, everyone with all kinds of weapons and household items, their morale was so high; Niu Dashui brought a part of the district squad, together with the newly organized militia in the village, all prepared; As soon as it got dark, hundreds of people densely surrounded the watchtower.

    Dalaoque and the puppet soldiers were frightened because they didn't know what was going on. Dalaoque dared not show his face, hiding behind the battlements and shouted: "Neighbors, Eighth Route Army comrades, we are all one family, what's the matter, just tell us!" The masses shouted in unison: "Dalaoque, you have stayed too long, come down quickly! We want to demolish the building." "Dalaoque, we still want to keep our cornmeal for ourselves, go back and be ordinary people!" "Hey! Fellow puppet soldiers! The bricks, tiles and wood on your watchtower are all ours, we are waiting to use them!"

    Yang Xiaomei also led the masses in singing:
    Birds fly to the light,
    People go to the path of life!
    Don't be foreign slaves,
    Don't be Japanese dogs!
    Turn back and be a new person,
    Anyway, handing over the gun is a friend!

    As soon as the singing stopped, Niu Dashui shouted: "Dalaoque! You should also know about the annihilation of the Japanese squad in Xieli Village, right? We Chinese don't fight Chinese, quickly hand over your guns, put things in order, and come down immediately! We are all Chinese, come back to the Chinese side!"

    Dalaoque shouted from upstairs: "Okay, Captain Niu! Folks! I'll talk to my brothers." The puppet soldiers could be heard shouting upstairs: "What are you talking about! Just go down, we don't want to stay here anymore!" "Staying on this watchtower is so uncomfortable, do you want me to stay here for the rest of my life?" "We are all ready, just waiting for this day!" In an instant, bundled long guns, ammunition belts, and grenades were all tied with ropes and lowered from the battlements one bundle after another. Around the watchtower, a burst of applause immediately broke out, clapping louder and louder. Hundreds of people enthusiastically shouted: "Welcome puppet soldiers back home!" "Welcome Dalaoque to come over!" "We'll treat you to white flour today!"...

    In just a few days, Huanghua Village, He Village, Dongyu Village... many watchtowers were "shouted down" like this.

　　新儿女英雄传
    袁静　孔厥
    第十四回　结婚的谜（续二）
    五
    到了那一天，十八岁的牛小水扮了新娘：装着假发，穿着花缎旗袍，粉红袜子，半高跟皮鞋，擦脂抹粉，打扮得挺俊俏；头上蒙了一块红绸巾，腰里藏着小手枪。来帮助工作的陈大姐自告奋勇，给他当伴娘，也穿得很阔气。大杨庄的米保长装作新娘的表哥，穿着崭新的长袍马褂，戴着黑缎子小帽。县大队的四位武装同志也化装了亲戚。这六个人怀里都揣着枪。旁的同志另有任务，早都出发了。后半晌，这里送亲的船儿也开了。
    船儿划近斜柳村，村里新换的保长王福海，早准备好了一顶花轿，两顶小轿，四个吹鼓手，连同几个鬼子兵和一班伪军，在堤上等着呢。堤边岗楼上守楼的伪军都跑出来看，不远的水面上，有几个老乡划着“鹰排子”在放“鱼鹰”，只听见“呜——噢儿”一声叫，好些个鱼鹰哗的飞起来，在空中乱转，一下都钻进水里逮鱼去了。
    船儿傍了岸，王福海对米满仓点头说：“米先生，你们来啦！”米保长也笑着跟他打招呼。一伙人上了岸，陈大姐扶新娘进了花轿，她和米保长都坐进小轿里；吹鼓手吹打起来，前护后拥的进了村。从东街走到西街，望得见村西头岗楼上，挂了一面日本旗，村口有一伙民夫正在修路。西街上，鬼子小队长的临时公馆门口，很热闹，有卖纸烟的，卖丫梨的，卖糖葫芦的……还有些看热闹的闲人；两个鬼子兵在门口站岗。
    轿子一停，两个日本人陪着饭野迎了出来。这天，又矮又胖的饭野，穿着黑色的洋服；雪白的硬领一衬，那酒糟鼻子显得更红了。他龇牙咧嘴的笑着，迎接一伙人，到了客厅里。许多鬼子围上来，要看新娘。米保长忙拦挡住他们，笑着说：“太君，中国风俗，不能掀面巾！”王福海给鬼子介绍说：“这是新娘的表哥。”陈大姐急忙扶新娘进新房去。
    牛小水穿不惯高跟鞋，头上又顶了一块绸子，在门坎上绊了一下，差点儿摔倒。陈大姐忙扶住他，吓得出了一身汗。
    新房布置得很阔气：钢丝床，粉红帐子，大玻璃镜，躺椅……。新娘坐在床沿上，屋里挤满了日本人。陈大姐说：“你们都出去吧！新娘子害臊。”鬼子们都看着笑。米保长笑着推他们：“统统开路，统统开路的！”
    天已经黑下来。外面摆席了。男人们都到客厅里。客厅里吊着个大汽灯，灯光白得发青，亮得耀眼睛。饭野小队长请新娘的表哥上坐，米保长说：“太君的上坐！”饭野笑着说：“你的上坐！”满客厅的人有的让坐，有的打哈哈。一个个桌子上都放满了鸡鸭鱼肉，酒瓶酒杯儿。
    米保长他们五个，和饭野王福海一桌。米保长笑着说：“跟中国人结婚，要依中国风俗，大家多多的喝酒！”饭野小队长乐得鼻子眼睛都挤在一块儿了，大玻璃酒杯端起来咕嘟咕嘟的喝。王福海不断的给他斟酒。旁的人也都劝的劝、喝的喝。那些伺候的人跑来跑去，太阳牌啤酒一瓶一瓶的打飞了盖儿，送到一个个桌子上去。听得见厢房里那些伪军小头儿，划拳的声音也闹成了一片。
    喝了一会，鬼子们喝上了劲儿，都拿起瓶子往嘴里灌。一个个喝成了丑八怪的样儿。有一个鬼子，就是那个“狗牙子伤”的，白脸儿喝得通红，抬了抬他的小眼镜，站起来，把军衣一脱，只穿个花条儿衬衫，在客厅当中跳起舞来了；腰里挂着一个布缝的小人儿也一跳一跳的。那对眼镜滑到了鼻尖上，他的眼睛在眼镜框子上面，滑稽的翻来翻去，作着各种鬼脸儿。他一面跳，一面唱。许多日本人用筷子敲着酒杯酒瓶打拍子，也都唱起来。
    到后来，他们有的拍着巴掌，有的晃着脑袋，乱唱乱笑乱嚷。桌子上弄得乱七八糟，好些个碟儿碗儿跌碎在地上……真是越闹越不成样儿！同志们看着敌人这个疯狂劲儿，心里都恨得痒痒的。
    六
    王福海的媳妇也在厨房里帮忙，她给新娘送来了饭，陈大姐和小水马马虎虎的吃了些，叫把饭端下去了。陈大姐把美孚灯捻暗些，悄悄对小水说：“快来了，你可沉住气，别露了馅儿！”小水低声说：“你们在外面，好好照着点儿！别叫我作了蹩子。万一闹坏了，你们可别丢下我就跑了！”大姐笑着说：“还能那样儿！只要你成了功，外面没问题。”
    一会儿，两个鬼子架着小队长进来，扶他坐在床边的躺椅上。两个鬼子歪着嘴巴笑着出去了。大姐也忙出去，顺手带上门。小水侧着身子坐在床沿上，低着头儿。客厅里传来话匣子唱戏的声音。
    饭野小队长醉醺醺的向后靠着，笑得眯缝了两只眼睛，怪馋的瞅着新娘子的侧后影。他抽了半支烟，然后扔开烟头儿，拍着椅子说：“来来来！这里的坐！”小水心跳着，不言声。饭野以为新娘子害羞哩，缩起红鼻子，露出一口大黄牙，嘻嘻嘻的笑着，伸手来拉他。小水一侧歪就爬在床上，偷偷的掏枪。饭野歪歪斜斜的起来，涎着脸儿拉他的腿。小水回过身来，嘡的一枪，没打中。饭野一楞，小水连着又打两枪，就把他打死了。
    新房里枪一响，客厅里几个同志立刻拔出枪来，踢翻桌子，先打带枪的。鬼子们来不及掏枪，就给打死在地上。一时客厅里大乱。同志们堵住门口，一边打一边喊着：“投降不杀！”院子里，从墙上跳下来许多人，都是预先埋伏的县区武装，有些奔客厅，有些奔厢房。大门口两个站岗的鬼子兵，听到里面打起来，提着枪就往里面跑，忽然身后边几声枪响，两个站岗的都倒下了。那些化装小贩的村干部，都拿着枪往里面冲。这当儿，月亮还没上来，天很黑。村东头，淀边鹰排子上的“老乡”，听到第一声枪响，就纷纷掏枪上岸；村西头，歇在大庙里的“民夫”们，也提了枪跑出来；这些都是区小队和村里秘密组织起来的民兵。黑老蔡跟岗楼上一部分伪军早接好头，这时候里应外合，不发一枪一弹，就把两个岗楼全拿下了。
    一会儿，公馆里的枪声停了。厢房里那些伪军小头儿，都是黑老蔡教育过的，一见八路军得了手，都顺顺当当的缴了枪。客厅里的鬼子，死的死，伤的伤；有的跪在地上求饶，有的钻在桌子底下，给拖了出来；有的砸碎玻璃窗想逃命，也给活捉了。大厅里打了个稀里哗啦，花瓶粉碎，碟子碗儿稀栏，桌椅板凳东倒西歪，军旗扑克牌撒了一地……
    同志们忙着搜索武器。牛小水打了一阵，假发早不知掉到哪儿去了，露着小光头；鞋也丢了一只，粉红袜子踩在地上乱跑。他瞧见墙角落里立着个衣架，衣架上面挂一件黄呢子大衣，他满心欢喜，赶忙脱子花缎子旗袍，就去拿大衣，没想到那大衣自个儿在咕咙咕咙的动呢。小水吓了一跳，拿枪头子把大衣往起一挑，见里面藏着个鬼子，猴儿爬竿似的抱着衣架的杆儿，擞擞的发抖。小水喝一声：“快下来！”鬼子一害怕，连人带衣架倒在地上，小水忙把他按住；米保长跑来一看，原来就是跳舞的那个“狗牙子伤”，也给活捉了。
    街上，人声嘈杂。村里的男女老少，都奔往岗楼去。他们举着火把，拿着铁镐铁铣，筐儿担子……一齐动手拆岗楼。拆下的木料、砖瓦，都弄回家去。只一夜工夫，两个大岗楼全成了平地。
    七
    斜柳村的胜利，使附近各庄的伪军更动摇了。咱们的干部和老百姓都说：“趁热好打铁，把剩下的这些岗楼都他妈的一扫光吧！”
    这一天，杨小梅把申家庄的工会，农会，青会，妇会，儿童团，全动员起来了，大家拿着各种各样的家什武器，情绪可高多啦；牛大水带来了一部分区小队，跟村里新组织的民兵一块儿，也都准备好了；天一擦黑，好几百人就密密层层的围住了岗楼。
    大老鸹和伪军们不知道是怎么回事，都吓坏了。大老鸹不敢露脸，藏在垛口后面喊：“邻亲们，八路同志们，咱们都是一家人，有什么事，你们就说吧！”群众齐着声音喊：“大老鸹，你们待的日子太长了，快下来吧！我们要拆楼啦。”“大老鸹，我们的棒子面，还想留着自个儿吃呢，你们回去当老百姓吧！”“喂！伪军同胞们！你们那岗楼上的砖瓦木料都是我们的，我们等着使唤呢！”
    杨小梅还领着群众唱：
    鸟向明处飞，
    人向活路走！
    不做洋人奴，
    不当日本狗！
    回心转意重做人，
    反正交枪是朋友！
    歌声一停，牛大水就喊：“大老鸹！斜柳村消灭鬼子小队的事儿，你们该也知道了吧？咱们中国人不打中国人，你们快把枪缴了，把东西归着归着，马上就下来吧！都是中国人，快回到中国人这边来吧！”
    大老鸹在楼上喊：“行喽，牛队长！老乡们！我跟弟兄们说说。”听得见伪军们在楼上嚷着：“说什么！下去就下去，早就不想在这上面待了！”“待在这岗楼上怪难受的，还叫我待一辈子啊？”“我们都准备好了，就等着这一天呢！”一刹时，捆扎好的长枪，子弹带，手榴弹，都用绳子从垛口上一捆一捆吊下来。岗楼四周围，立时起了一片拍掌声，越拍越响。几百个老百姓热烈的喊着：“欢迎伪军同胞回家！”“欢迎大老鸹反正！”“今儿个请你们吃白面！”……
    只几天工夫，黄花村，何庄，东渔村……好些个岗楼，都这么“叫下来”了。
    （未完）
