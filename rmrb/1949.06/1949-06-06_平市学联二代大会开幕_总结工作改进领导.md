　　Ping Municipality Student Federation Second Congress Opens: Summarizing Work and Improving Leadership

    [Our Newspaper] The Second Congress of the First Session of the Ping Municipality Student Federation, representing 60,000 students and 137 universities and middle schools in Beiping, opened yesterday (5th) at the Ping Municipality Sino-French University Auditorium. 184 representatives attended. The All-China Student Federation, the Tianjin Student Federation, and various party, government, and civil organizations in Beiping Municipality attended to offer their congratulations. The meeting will thoroughly summarize the experiences of the student movement in Beiping, and study and overcome some of the difficulties encountered in learning - such as the learning order has not been well established, the learning point of view is not entirely correct, the reform of the academic system and curriculum, etc. Comrade Xu Liqun specifically stated that Communist Party members and Youth League members in schools should humbly listen to the opinions of students, take the lead in learning, and become the core of uniting the majority of students. Professor Xu Deheng introduced what he saw during his participation in the All-China Road trip to the Soviet Union, where Soviet students studied hard and strictly observed order. Wang Shigu, Secretary-General of the Student Federation Executive Committee, reported on the work of the Executive Committee in the past three months. He said that the work of the Student Federation still has the shortcomings of being passive and unplanned. He put forward the preliminary opinion of the Executive Committee: the Student Federation should clearly recognize that its main task is to strengthen ideological leadership of learning in various schools, organize exchanges of experiences from various schools, and should not do too much administrative work. The various departments of the Student Federation should strengthen policy leadership for the corresponding departments of various schools and should not take over and do everything themselves. After Gu Qizong, Chairman of the Student Federation Executive Committee, reported on the draft on further developing the learning problem in Beiping schools submitted by the Executive Committee for discussion at the conference, the representative of the Girls' High School Affiliated to Normal University reported on the experience of the Girls' High School Affiliated to Normal University in organizing learning, the representative of the Municipal Girls' Second High School reported on the process of fair and reasonable review of relief funds in the Girls' Second High School, and the representative of the Beiping Municipal Normal School reported on the situation of the Beiping Normal School overcoming freedom and laxity and transitioning to learning. Finally, Wang Enhai, a member of the Executive Committee, reported on the disorder and chaos in the Affiliated Middle School of China University on behalf of the school. The meeting also passed a temporary motion to send a delegation to the Teachers' Day today to present a banner to the representatives of primary and secondary school teachers to pay tribute.
