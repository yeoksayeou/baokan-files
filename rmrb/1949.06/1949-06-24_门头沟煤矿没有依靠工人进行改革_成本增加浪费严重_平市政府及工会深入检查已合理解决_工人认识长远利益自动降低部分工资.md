    【Special Dispatch from Our Newspaper】Reporter Lin Chi reports that after the takeover of the Mentougou Coal Mine, the largest mine of the Pingxi Coal Mining Company, due to insufficient study of the original system and organization and the failure to appropriately adjust and rationally manage according to the existing specific conditions, although production has increased month by month since March, costs (such as the cost per ton of coal extracted) have also increased month by month. This completely violated the principle that increased production should lead to decreased costs, becoming a major obstacle to the development of the Mentougou mine.

    According to the mine's investigation: Mentougou Mine produced 31,030 tons of coal in March, 39,520 tons in April, and increased to 43,585 tons in May. In theory, increased production should lead to a relative reduction in costs; however, the opposite is true. Even looking solely at the "extraction cost" (i.e., the wages spent on getting the product from underground to the surface), it has been increasing month by month: in January, the extraction cost per ton was equivalent to 15.29 catties of millet, increasing to 21.37 catties in February, 25.33 catties in March, 28.50 catties in April, and 30 catties in May. Now, with the arrival of the slow sales season and falling coal prices, based on the total cost of 76.76 catties of millet per ton in April, plus taxes, each ton sold results in a loss of about a dozen catties of millet. If this continues, it is estimated that losses will amount to about 500,000 catties of millet per month in June and July.

    The main reasons for the increased costs are an irrational bonus system and poor management. From February to May, the total amount of bonuses increased fourfold, while the number of underground workers only increased by one-third. This is because the takeover personnel lacked understanding and control of the bonus system. Mentougou Mine originally had three types of bonuses: coal mining bonuses (high-efficiency bonuses), footage bonuses, and commission bonuses. Among them, the coal mining bonus lacked clear administrative regulations on the criteria for awarding bonuses, and staff members were not conscientious and responsible. After liberation, the bonus standards for almost all seventeen production teams were lowered (if the coal quality was soft, the distance for carrying baskets was short, and the coal extraction conditions were favorable, the standards had to be raised; if the coal quality was hard and the distance was long, the standards should be lowered), resulting in a trend of equal distribution of bonuses. Judging from the development from February to May, the number of bonus recipients on February 5th was 989, which increased to 2,299 on May 5th, accounting for more than 95% of all piece-rate workers on that day. Among them, those who received the highest bonus accounted for more than 80% of all bonus recipients (the coal mining bonus was divided into three levels according to the degree of efficiency improvement: large, medium, and small, with the large level being the highest bonus). This created a situation where everyone received a bonus, and it was not uncommon to catch up with the highest level. This tendency towards equal distribution of bonuses completely lost its role in encouraging production. The footage bonus was originally established based on needs (such as when encountering hard coal quality or water-filled tunnels), but now, regardless of whether it is needed or not, there is a bonus for any footage opened, which also lost the original meaning of the incentive. As for the commission bonus, it was originally an incentive for the enemy to reward the contractor's foremen for recruiting more workers to go underground (if the number of underground workers exceeded fifty, a 10% bonus was added to the foreman's bonus; if it exceeded seventy-five, a 20% bonus was added; if it exceeded one hundred, a 30% bonus was added). Now that it has been changed to production teams, the contractor's foremen have been abolished, but the bonus has not been cancelled.

    In order to overcome this situation, Mu Zehan, Director of the Ping Municipal Enterprise Bureau, Gu Jingbo, Manager of Pingxi Coal Mining Company, Gao Zhende, Supervisory Committee Member, and Comrade Zu Tiangong of the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions, went to Mentougou to investigate and research. Starting from the 15th, they held consecutive review meetings with administrative and trade union cadres, joint meetings of production team leaders, meetings of worker representatives, forums with trade union leaders, production team leaders, activists, veteran workers, mine managers, engineers, and technical personnel. They thoroughly reviewed the work after the takeover and determined a preliminary plan to raise bonus standards, reform the system, and streamline the organization, correcting the above unreasonable situations: the standards for coal mining bonuses were appropriately raised, the footage bonus was cancelled except where necessary, and the commission bonus was deemed unnecessary and discontinued. In addition, inappropriate parts of other systems were also appropriately adjusted. In order to prevent losses to the public and to ensure the sustainability of the Mentougou mine, the unit price wage for piece-rate workers was also reduced by 10% to 15% at the suggestion of the workers. In order to reward material conservation, separate measures were formulated to incentivize it: for example, transporting wooden pillars from the backfilled roadways (i.e., abandoned roadways that have been mined out) to the surface would be rewarded based on the length of the wood. Streamlining the management organization on the surface is also underway and is expected to be completed by the end of this month. After these irrational systems are improved, waste can be overcome, and costs can be guaranteed to be reduced reasonably.

    The Mentougou Coal Mine has a large organization, and unreasonable systems have existed for a long time. Because the mine's leadership was not familiar with the old systems and management methods, they only knew how to maintain the status quo and failed to seriously study and improve them in a timely manner. At the same time, they did not have enough contact with the trade union work, and the opinions provided by the trade union on the above issues were not given due attention, resulting in delays in resolving them. This time, the Municipal Enterprise Bureau and the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions jointly went to the mine, first reviewing the relationship between the administration and the trade union, strengthening unity, and then, after investigation and research, listening to workers' opinions, mobilizing workers to discuss, and explaining the mine's actual difficulties to the workers, so that everyone realized that this reform was for the development of the Mentougou mine and for the long-term interests of all employees. Therefore, the reform of unreasonable systems and the changes in some wages were approved at the general meeting of all employees. After these reforms were announced, one worker said, "The peasants joined the army and paid public grain to liberate us, we cannot enjoy the fruits of liberation and let the peasants subsidize us dozens of catties of millet every month." Someone else said, "We won't talk about big principles, but just based on our own stomachs, we have to think about the mine. If the mine collapses, no one will benefit."

    The incident of poor management at the Mentougou Coal Mine is worth noting for the heads of industrial and mining enterprises that have just been taken over in various places. They should not adopt an irresponsible attitude towards the original organizational system and allow it to be retained without principle, otherwise it will easily leave loopholes and cause huge losses to the public.

### 门头沟煤矿没有依靠工人进行改革  成本增加浪费严重  平市政府及工会深入检查已合理解决  工人认识长远利益自动降低部分工资

    门头沟煤矿没有依靠工人进行改革
    成本增加浪费严重
    平市政府及工会深入检查已合理解决
    工人认识长远利益自动降低部分工资
    【本报特讯】记者林炽报导，平西煤矿公司最大的门头沟煤矿接管后，由于对原有制度与机构研究不够，不能根据现有具体条件加以适当调整与合理管理，虽三月份以来产量逐月增加，但成本（如每吨煤的出井成本等）亦随着逐月增加，完全违反了产量增加成本递减的规律，成为门矿发展上的一大障碍。
    根据矿方调查：门矿三月份产煤三一○三○吨，四月份产煤三九五二○吨，五月份增至四三五八五吨。按常理，产量增加，成本应相对减低；但事实却相反：即单以“出井成本”（即产品由井下到井上耗去的工资）来看，却逐月增涨着：一月份每吨出井成本合小米一五·二九斤，二月份增至二一·三七斤，三月份二五·三三斤，四月份二八·五○斤，五月份增至三○斤。现在又碰上销路淡月，煤价下跌，以四月份每吨总成本七六·七六斤小米计算，加上捐税，每吨出售时要赔累约十多斤小米。长此以往，至六、七月份，估计每月要赔贴小米五十万斤左右。
    造成成本提高的主要原因，是奖金制度不合理和管理不善。自二月至五月，奖金总额增加了四倍，而下井人数则只增加了三分之一。这是因为接管人员对奖金制度认识不够、掌握不够的缘故。门矿原有奖金三种，即采煤奖金（高效奖金）、进尺奖金、提成奖金。其中采煤奖金由于行政上没有明确规定给奖标准，职员也没有认真负责，解放后十七个生产小组的给奖标准几乎全部降低（煤质软，背筐距离短，出煤条件有利，标准便须提高；煤质硬，距离长，便应降低），造成了奖金平均化的趋势。自二月至五月的发展看来，得奖人数二月五日为九八九人，五月五日即增至二二九九人，竟占该日全体件工的百分之九十五以上。而其中得最高奖金的竟占全体得奖人的百分之八十强（采煤奖金按效率提高的程度分为大坎、中坎、小坎三种，大坎为最高奖金）。形成人人得奖，撵上大坎也不稀罕的情形。这种奖金平均化的倾向，完全失去了鼓励生产的作用。进尺奖金原先是根据需要设立的（如遇到煤质硬，或有水的巷道的时候），但现在不论需要不需要，凡开巷进尺都有奖，也失去了原先奖励的意义了。至于奖金提成，本来是敌人奖励包工柜多召集工人下井的（下井工人超过五十人，在奖金中加一成奖给柜上，超过七十五人加二成，超过百人加三成），现在改为生产组，包工柜已取消，但奖金仍未取消。
    为克服此种情况，平市企业局局长牟泽涵、平西煤矿公司经理谷静波、监察委员高振德、市总工会祖田工同志等，特同赴门头沟调查研究，自十五日起，连日召开行政工会干部检讨会、生产组班长联席会、工人代表会，工会组长、生产组长、积极分子、老工人、矿长、工程师及技术人员座谈会，深入检讨了接管后的工作，确定了提高给奖标准，改革制度，和精简机构的初步方案，将上述不合理的情况加以纠正：采煤奖金的标准适当提高，进尺奖金除必要的以外都取消，奖金提成没有必要，不再设立。此外，其他制度的不合理部分亦有适当调整。为了使公家不赔损，使门矿能维持下去，件工的单价工资，也在工友的建议下减低了一成至一成五。为了奖励节约材料，另订节约材料奖励办法：如回采后巷道（即已采尽的废巷道）中的木柱运到井上可按木材长短给奖，精简井上管理机构也在着手进行，预定本月底完成。这些不合理制度改进后，浪费现象可以克服，成本便可保证合理减低。
    门头沟煤矿的机构庞大，制度不合理的现象存在已久。由于该矿领导上对旧有各项制度和管理方法不熟悉，只知保留现状，未能认真研究及时改进，同时与工会工作联系不够，工会对上述问题所提供意见未能适当注意，以致拖延未决。此次市企业局与市总工会联合下矿，首先检讨行政与工会的关系，加强团结，然后经过调查研究，听取工人意见，发动工人讨论，向工友们解释矿里的实际困难，使大家认识到这次改革是为了门矿的发展，也是为了全体职工们的长远利益，因此，不合理制度的改革及部分工资的更动，得在全体职工大会上通过。当这些改革宣布之后，一位工友说：“农民参军缴公粮解放咱们，咱们不能坐享解放福，倒叫农民每月再垫给咱们几十斤小米”。又有人说：“咱们不说大道理，就凭自己的肚子，也得替矿上想一想，拖垮了矿山谁也没有好处”。
    此次门矿经营不善事件值得各地初接管的工矿负责人注意，对于原有机构制度，不应采取不负责任态度，任其无原则保留，否则即易留下漏洞，使公家蒙受巨大损失。
