　　Northwest Steel Plant Starts Steel Production

    [Taiyuan Telegraph] The Northwest Steel Plant in Taiyuan, after resuming operations, produced its first batch of steel on May 20th. The output has reached the pre-liberation level, and the quality has also improved. Before liberation, it generally took eleven to twelve hours from loading the furnace to tapping the steel. After the resumption of work this time, the first furnace took 9 hours and 20 minutes, and the second furnace took only 8 hours and 35 minutes. According to this calculation, it is certain that the pre-liberation record of 48 furnaces of steel per month can be exceeded. Since the plant started firing the furnace on April 27, workers in the gas section have put forward many suggestions for improvement, and the gas furnace workers have also spontaneously proposed competitions to ensure sufficient gas supply and shorten the smelting time. Before liberation, the temperature of the heat storage chamber was generally around 900 degrees, but now it has increased to 1160 degrees.

　　西北炼钢厂开始出钢
    【太原电】复工后的太原西北炼钢厂，已于五月二十日首次出钢。产量已达解放前水平，质量亦有提高。该厂解放前，从装炉到出钢一般需时十一至十二小时，此次复工后，第一炉用时九点二十分钟，至第二炉则仅用时八点三十五分钟。据此计算，定可超过解放前每月出钢四十八炉的纪录。该厂自四月二十七日开始烧炉以来，煤气股的工人曾提出许多改进意见，煤气炉工人并自动提出竞赛，使煤气供给充足，缩短了冶炼时间。按解放前储热室的温度一般是九百度左右，现则增至一千一百六十度。
