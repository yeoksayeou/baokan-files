Xinhua News Agency, Beiping, 5th: The All-China Students' Federation issued a letter to students in newly liberated areas such as Nanjing and Shanghai on the 4th. The full text is as follows:

Comrades in Shanghai, Nanjing, Hangzhou, Nanchang, Wuhan, Xi'an, Taiyuan, Qingdao, and other newly liberated areas:

Under the heroic fighting of the People's Liberation Army, Shanghai, Nanjing, Hangzhou, Nanchang, Wuhan, Xi'an, Taiyuan, Qingdao, and many other cities have been liberated successively. The All-China Students' Federation, on behalf of students nationwide, extends warm congratulations on your liberation!

In the past, under the fascist rule of the Kuomintang, you suffered all kinds of hardships and persecutions. The Kuomintang bandit gang, in its death throes, even more frantically persecuted and arrested your comrades and destroyed your schools. But you have always fought resolutely and bravely, and carried out the work of protecting schools and welcoming liberation on the eve of liberation. This indomitable fighting spirit has given great encouragement to students across the country.

Since liberation, you have continued this spirit, assisting the People's Liberation Army and the People's Government in establishing revolutionary order, resuming classes and schools, and studying and publicizing the policies of the People's Government. In order to carry the revolution through to the end and establish a new democratic China nationwide, we believe that you will certainly be able to further participate in revolutionary work, strengthen your studies, establish the perspective of combining with workers and peasants to serve workers and peasants, and cultivate yourselves into useful talents for building a new democratic China!

The Fourteenth National Student Congress, held in Beiping from March 1st to 6th this year, was a victorious meeting of students from the liberated areas and those from the Kuomintang-ruled areas at that time. The congress defined the current tasks of Chinese students and established the organization of the All-China Students' Federation. Today, the vast Kuomintang-ruled areas have been liberated, and all obstacles preventing our close unity have been eliminated. We hope that you will be able to establish student unions and regional student federations in a step-by-step manner, unite the students into the organization of the All-China Students' Federation, and advance together under the banner of Mao Zedong. We wish you progress!

　　全国学生联合会发表
  　告新解放区同学书
  　号召加强学习树立新观点
    【新华社北平五日电】中华全国学生联合会四日发表告南京上海等新解放区同学书，全文如下：
    上海、南京、杭州、南昌、武汉、西安、太原、青岛以及其他新解放地区的同学们：
    在人民解放军英勇战斗之下，上海、南京、杭州、南昌、武汉、西安、太原、青岛以及其他许多城市相继解放了。中华全国学生联合会谨代表全国同学为你们的解放而热烈庆贺！
    过去你们在国民党的法西斯统治之下，受尽了百般苦难与迫害。国民党匪帮在它垂死挣扎的时候，更疯狂地残害和逮捕你们的同伴，破坏你们的学校。但是你们一直坚决英勇的斗争着，并且在解放前夕进行了保护学校及迎接解放的工作。这种不屈不挠的战斗精神给全国同学很大的鼓舞。
    解放以后，你们又继续这种精神，协助人民解放军、人民政府建立革命秩序，复校复课，学习与宣传人民政府的各项政策。为了将革命进行到底，在全国范围内建立新民主主义的新中国，相信你们一定能够更进一步地参加革命工作，并加强学习，树立与工农结合为工农服务的观点，培养自己成为建设新民主主义新中国的有用人才！
    今年三月一日到六日在北平召开的第十四届全国学生代表大会，是解放区同学和当时国民党统治区同学的胜利会师。在大会上规定了中国学生的当前任务，并成立了中华全国学生联合会的组织。今天广大的国民党统治地区已经解放了，阻挠我们密切团结的一切障碍已经消除，希望你们能够有步骤地建立学生会及各地区学联，把同学们团结到全国学联的组织里来，共同在毛泽东的旗帜下前进。祝你们进步！
  　　　　　　中华全国学生联合会
    六月四日
