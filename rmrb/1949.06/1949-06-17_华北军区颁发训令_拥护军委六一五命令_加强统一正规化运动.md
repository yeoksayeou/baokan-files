　　Strengthening the Unified Standardization Movement
[Special Dispatch from Our Newspaper] After receiving the order issued by the Chinese People's Revolutionary Military Commission on June 15th, "Announcing the Styles of the Military Flag and Military Emblem of the Chinese People's Liberation Army," the North China Military Region immediately issued an order to educate the North China People's Liberation Army to earnestly implement the Military Commission's order, rectify military discipline, and enhance military appearance and etiquette, and strengthen the unified movement and standardization movement. The full text of the order is as follows:

　　　　Order of the Headquarters and Political Department of the North China Military Region

The Chinese People's Revolutionary Military Commission issued an order on June 15th, announcing the styles of the military flag and military emblem of the Chinese People's Liberation Army. The announcement of the military flag and military emblem is a major event marking an era in the history of our People's Liberation Army. It shows that since the Nanchang Uprising on August 1, 1927, our army has been diligently cultivated and correctly led by the Communist Party of China and its leader, Comrade Mao Zedong, and has grown and strengthened through long-term struggle. Today, it has achieved a decisive victory throughout the country. The spark of fire twenty-two years ago is now a giant star illuminating the entire China; it marks that the Chinese People's Liberation Army is becoming a completely standardized army, symbolizing the independent dignity and glory of the new China of people's democracy. The North China People's Liberation Army is deeply gratified to have participated in the fighting ranks of the great People's Liberation War and to enjoy this supreme honor. We wholeheartedly support this order of the Military Commission, earnestly implement it, and use it to educate the entire army, rectify military discipline, enhance military appearance and etiquette, strengthen the army's unified movement and standardization movement, and strive to complete the task of regular army building.

Our People's Liberation Army has long been in a decentralized guerrilla warfare environment, which has caused us to be contaminated with guerrilla habits and lack the habit of abiding by regular systems and unified styles. This was naturally not surprising in the past. However, today the situation has fundamentally changed. An independent and unified new China of people's democracy is about to be born. The People's Liberation Army is the defender of the People's Democratic Republic and a symbol of its strength. This requires the People's Liberation Army to strive for its own regular and modernized construction, and to vigilantly stand on its combat post forever, so that it can become a reliable guarantee for protecting the independence of the motherland and the peaceful labor and production of the people. Therefore, strengthening the army's unified movement and standardization movement has become a serious task for the People's Liberation Army today; the guerrilla habits and the bad phenomena of disorganization, indiscipline, and anarchism left over from the past, which are contrary to this, must be thoroughly eliminated.

Strengthening the unified movement and standardization movement is by no means an empty slogan; it must be specifically embodied in certain forms and practical actions: unified military flag and military emblem, unified regular system and various styles, strict military discipline, military appearance and military etiquette. We oppose formalism, but we must have the necessary forms to represent the glory and dignity of the People's Liberation Army. We will draw inspiration from these certain forms for the great spirit of bravery, strength, neatness, and seriousness, thereby developing good habits, strong fighting spirit, accurate actions, diligence in our duties, completion of tasks, and the entire army uniting as one person, advancing courageously under unified orders, and resolutely fighting to protect the struggle and labor achievements of the Chinese people!

We must strictly check the guerrilla habits, violations of orders, and phenomena that undermine military discipline still left in various units, and effectively correct them. The General Headquarters of the People's Liberation Army has uniformly stipulated the style of clothing and the method of wearing chest badges, but recently there are still many cadres and soldiers who violate this order, with untidy military appearance and lax discipline. On the streets, one can often see people not wearing military caps, not buttoning their collars, not wearing military uniforms, not wearing chest badges, or wearing non-standard ones; some female staff members in the army only wear military pants but not military coats, and do not wear military caps while strolling on the streets; some soldiers carry women on bicycles, or eat snacks at stalls, etc., phenomena that undermine discipline and military appearance. The emergence of these bad phenomena is partly the residue of guerrilla habits, and partly the manifestation of the freedom and laxity of petty-bourgeois intellectuals, which are incompatible with the serious, neat and regular style of the People's Liberation Army and must be rectified.

All organs and units of our North China People's Liberation Army should educate all personnel on the Military Commission's June 15th order, the Xinhua News Agency's short commentary of the same day, and this order, so that they can truly understand that wearing military uniforms and wearing military emblems and symbols is a symbol of glory, not a fashionable decoration, inspire consciousness, and strictly abide by all the established systems and styles without reservation. Anything that is not stipulated cannot be decided on one's own, or to be unconventional, and cultivate the habit of strictly observing regular systems and unified styles, overcome disorganization, indiscipline, and anarchy, encourage each other, and jointly safeguard the dignity and honor of the People's Liberation Army. The troops performing disciplinary duties, in addition to influencing the entire army with their exemplary actions, should conscientiously perform their duties and correct all those who repeatedly fail to correct their mistakes, undermine military discipline, and damage the honor of the People's Liberation Army. All personnel wearing military uniforms should obey their discipline. Through efforts in both strengthening education and conscientious discipline, we will make the military discipline and appearance completely new after we have received the military flag and military emblem.

All commanders, fighters, and political workers, we must cherish the military flag and military emblem as we cherish our own lives, protect their dignity, and prevent them from being damaged, insulted, or defiled. We cannot allow anyone from the outside to damage, insult, or defile them; similarly, we must strictly rectify military discipline, enhance military appearance, and promote etiquette to protect their dignity and glory, and cannot allow anyone from the inside to damage, insult, or defile them. Let us all work together, starting from rectifying military discipline, enhancing military appearance, and promoting etiquette, to strengthen our unified and regular construction.

　　华北军区颁发训令
  　拥护军委六一五命令
  　加强统一正规化运动
    【本报特讯】华北军区在接到中国人民革命军事委员会六月十五日发布的“公布中国人民解放军军旗及军徽的样式”命令后，当即颁发训令，教育华北人民解放军切实实行军委命令，整饬军风纪、严肃军容与军队礼节，加强统一运动与正规化运动。训令全文如下：
    　　　　华北军区司令部、政治部训令
    中国人民革命军事委员会，六月十五日发布命令，公布了中国人民解放军军旗及军徽的样式。军旗军徽的公布，是我人民解放军建军史上划时期的重大事件，表示我军自从一九二七年八月一日南昌起义诞生以来，在中国共产党和她的领袖毛泽东同志辛勤培植与正确领导下，经过长期奋斗，发展壮大，令天已在全国范围内取得了决定的胜利，二十二年前的星星之火，今天已是普照全中国的灿烂光明的巨星了；标志着中国人民解放军正在成为一支完全正规化的军队，象征着人民民主的新中国的独立的尊严与光荣。华北人民解放军深以参与了伟大的人民解放战争的战斗行列，得以享受这一无尚光荣而庆幸。我们衷心拥护军委这一命令，切实执行，并以此教育全军，整饬军风纪、严肃军容与军队礼节，加强军队的统一运动与正规化运动，努力完成军队正规建设的任务。
    我人民解放军，曾经长期处在分散的游击战争环境，使我们沾染了游击作风，缺乏遵守正规制度和统一制式的习惯，这在过去是自然的不足为怪的。但是今天情况根本改变了，独立的统一的人民民主的新中国即将诞生，人民解放军是人民民主共和国的保卫者，是它强盛力量的象征。这就要求人民解放军努力自己正规化近代化的建设，警惕地永远站在自己的战斗岗位上，使自己成为保护祖国的独立与人民的和平劳动、生产建设的可靠保证。因此加强全军的统一运动与正规化运动，成为人民解放军当前严重的任务；与此相抵触的过去遗留下来的游击作风和无组织、无纪律、无政府的恶劣现象，必须彻底予以肃清。
    加强统一运动与正规化运动，决不是一句空洞的口号，它必须具体体现为一定的形式和实际行动：统一的军旗军徽，统一的正规制度与各种制式，严肃的军风纪、军容和军队礼节。我们反对形式主义，但是我们必须有足以代表人民解放军的光荣与尊严的必要的形式。我们将从这一定的形式中，得到勇敢、坚强、整齐、严肃等伟大精神的启示，从而养成良好的习惯，斗志旺盛，动作确实，克尽职守，完成任务，全军团结一致象一个人，在统一的号令下，勇往直前，为保护中国人民的斗争和劳动成果而坚决奋斗！
    我们必须严格检查各部队还遗留着的游击作风、违反命令和败坏军风纪的现象，并予以有效的纠正。人民解放军总部曾统一规定了服装式样，和胸章佩带办法，但是最近仍有不少干部战士违反这一命令，军容不整，风纪松弛，街道上可以经常看到不戴军帽，不扣风纪扣，不穿军装上身，不佩带胸章，或佩带不合制式；军队中的妇女工作人员，有的只穿军裤，不着军衣，不戴军帽，街头散步；有的军人骑自行车携带妇女，或在小摊吃零食等等败坏风纪军容的现象。这些恶劣现象的产生，一部分是游击作风的残余，另一部分则是小资产阶级知识分子自由散漫的表现，这与人民解放军的严肃整齐正规作风，是不相容的，必须加以整饬。
    我华北人民解放军各机关部队，应当将军委六月十五日命令、同日新华社短评及本训令在全体人员中进行教育，使之真正认识穿着军服、佩带军徽及符号的意义，是光荣的标志，而非时髦的点缀，启发自觉，凡是规定了的一切制度制式，必须毫无保留的严格遵照执行，凡是没有规定的，即不能擅自作主，标新立异，养成严格遵守正规制度统一制式的习惯，克服无组织无纪律无政府状态，互相勉励，共同维护人民解放军的庄严与荣誉。而担任纠察勤务的部队，除以自己模范行动影响全军外，应认真履行自己的职责，纠察一切屡教不改、败坏军风纪、损害人民解放军荣誉的人员，任何穿着军服的人员，均应服从他们的纠察。用加强教育与认真纠察两方面的努力，使风纪军容在我们受领了军旗和军徽后，焕然一新。
    全体指挥员、战斗员、政治工作人员，我们要爱护军旗军徽，象爱护我们自己的生命一样，保卫它们的尊严，不使它们受到损坏，侮慢、和玷辱。我们不能容许从外部有任何人来损坏、侮慢、玷辱它们，同样，我们要严格整饬军风纪、严肃军容、提倡礼节，来受护它们的尊严和光荣，不能容许从内部有任何人来损坏、侮慢、玷辱它们。大家一致努力，从整饬军风纪、严肃军容、提倡礼节做起，加强我们统一的正规的建设。
