　　Developments in the Burmese Situation

　　【Xinhua News Agency, Peiping, 27th】Moscow Dispatch: The News reported on the 25th publishing an article by Bokov on “The Developments in the Burmese Situation,” which stated in brief: The events in Burma reflect the deepening crisis of the colonial system, a constituent part of the overall crisis of world capitalism, which has been exacerbated by the Second World War. During and after the Second World War, Burma's national liberation movement has taken on a massive scale, and it already has the support of the broad masses of the people. To extinguish this movement with weapons is clearly an arduous task that British imperialism cannot undertake. Thus, the British colonialists used certain means of retreat, relying primarily on British running dogs among the Burmese bourgeois nationalists to split the Anti-Fascist People's Freedom League, which was formed during the war of resistance against Japan. After the reactionary bourgeoisie in the Anti-Fascist League expelled the Burmese Communist Party from the league, it lost the support of the broad masses of the people and became a docile tool of British imperialism. As in other countries, the reactionary Burmese bourgeoisie is playing the shameful role of openly being imperialism's running dogs and traitors who sell out the people and national independence. However, the British imperialists and their Burmese running dogs have failed to extinguish the Burmese people's struggle for independence. The strike by 25,000 workers in the Burmese British-owned oilfields in March 1948, which was clearly political in nature, marked the beginning of a new high tide in the national liberation movement led by the working class and its vanguard, the Burmese Communist Party. The British colonial giants decided to provoke ethnic hatred between the Burmese and Karen peoples, inciting the latter to riot, hoping to accelerate the failure of the democratic movement. But this conspiracy backfired on its instigators. The riot went beyond the scope set by the British secret agents. The awakened working people among the Karen have begun to cooperate with the Burmese people. The United Front Committee of Burmese progressive forces is pursuing a program that stipulates the distribution of land to peasants, the abolition of the Anglo-Burmese financial and military agreements that enslave Burma, the confiscation of the property of large capitalists, and other reforms. Bokov stated: The failure of the British colonialists in Burma has had a serious impact on the Asian colonial system, which is collapsing.

　　缅甸局势的发展
    柏考莫夫
    【新华社北平二十七日电】莫斯科讯：消息报二十五日发表柏考莫夫论“缅甸局势的发展”一文略称：缅甸的事件反映出由于第二次世界大战而愈加恶化的世界资本主义总危机的构成部分——殖民制度危机的加深。在第二次世界大战期间和战后期间，缅甸的民族解放运动已形成巨大的规模，它已拥有广大的人民群众的支持。用武器来扑灭这个运动，显然是英帝国主义所不能担负的艰巨任务。于是，英殖民者就运用某些迁回的手段，首先是依靠缅甸资产阶级民族主义者中的英国走狗，来分裂在抗日战争过程中成立起来的反法西斯人民自由联盟。反法西斯联盟中的反动资产阶级，把缅甸共产党逐出了这个联盟以后，就使得它本身丧失了广大人民群众的支持，并变成了英帝国主义的顺从工具。和其他国家的情形一样，缅甸的反动资产阶级正在充当帝国主义的公开走狗及出卖人民和国家独立的卖国贼的可耻角色。可是，英帝国主义者及其缅甸走狗，未能扑灭缅甸人民争取独立的斗争。显然具有政治性质的一九四八年三月缅甸英商油田二万五千工人的罢工，标志着由工人阶级及其先锋队缅甸共产党领导的民族解放运动的新高潮的开始。英国殖民巨头决定挑起缅甸族与克仑族之间的民族仇恨，煽动后者暴动，希望借此加速民主运动的失败。但是这个阴谋却反而打击了阴谋的主使者。这一暴动越出了英国特务人员所拟定的范围。克仑族里觉悟的劳动人民已开始与缅甸人民合作。缅甸进步力量代表联合委员会正在奉行一个纲领，其中规定对农民分配土地，废除奴役缅甸的英缅财政协定及军事协定，没收大资本家财产以及其他改革。柏考莫夫称：英国殖民者在缅甸的失败，已使正在土崩瓦解中的亚洲殖民制度，受到严重的影响。
