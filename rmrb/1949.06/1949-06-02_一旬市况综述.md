　　A Summary of Market Conditions for the First Ten Days of June
[Our Newspaper's Report] Prices in the Ping (Beiping) market generally weakened during the first ten days of June, with fluctuations only appearing towards the end of the period. Compared with the previous ten days, grain prices rose by 8.73%, non-staple food prices rose by 9.39%, sundries rose by 1.99%, and fuel rose by 13.8%. The prices of other goods fell, with cotton yarn falling by 0.609% and other industrial products falling by 5.84%.

Grain – At the end of the previous ten days, grain prices in the city continued to rise, resulting in a large difference compared to other areas. For example, at the beginning of this ten-day period (June 21st), the price of rice in Beiping was 16 yuan higher than in Tianjin, 10.8 yuan higher than in Zhangjiakou, and 30.75 yuan higher than in Baoding (June 22nd). The price of all-purpose flour in Beiping was also 700 yuan higher than in Tianjin, 480 yuan higher than in Zhangjiakou, and 1,400 yuan higher than in Baoding (June 22nd). This led to the flow of goods and mutual price adjustments, resulting in the phenomenon of rising grain prices in Tianjin, Baoding, and other places, while falling in Beiping at the beginning of the period. By June 23rd, grain prices in most parts of North China had generally fallen. The reasons for this can be summarized as follows: ① Rainfall in most parts of North China led to greater public stability. ② The supply of grain increased, with grain shipments arriving in Tianjin and Beiping from the Northeast, Jiangnan, the Ping-Sui Railway, and the Tianjin-Pukou Railway. ③ After the liberation of Shanghai, prices there were lower than in North China.

From June 21st to June 27th, grain prices in Beiping gradually declined. This was because grain prices in Beiping were higher than in surrounding areas, prompting merchants from Tianjin, Zhangjiakou, Tangshan, Baoding, and other places to transport grain to Beiping, thereby increasing the supply of grain and causing some capital outflow. In addition, with the Dragon Boat Festival approaching, general businesses and money shops were settling accounts, tightening the money supply in the market.

At the end of the ten-day period, after June 28th, merchants here saw that although Shanghai had been liberated, goods could not be transported in a timely manner. On June 29th, private merchants took advantage of the trade company's Sunday holiday to stir up trouble in the market, causing grain prices to rise again.

Cotton Yarn – After the liberation of Shanghai, cotton yarn merchants sold off their goods in preparation for transferring funds south to purchase goods, causing cotton yarn prices to weaken continuously. In addition, the prices of cotton yarn in other areas were not much different from those in Tianjin and Beiping, reducing the number of buyers coming to Beiping. Cotton yarn from Jinan even flowed back north to Tianjin. By June 27th, compared with the beginning of the ten-day period, each bundle of 20-count Sanning cotton yarn had fallen by 350 yuan, and each bolt of Erchang Hong Wufu cotton cloth had fallen by 1,400 yuan. On June 28th, the cotton yarn situation changed again. Due to transportation issues preventing Shanghai goods from being transported north, speculative merchants seized the opportunity to operate, causing prices to rise again, higher than at the beginning of the ten-day period.

Sundries – Generally weakened under the influence of grain and cotton yarn, but due to the liberation of Shanghai, there were differences compared to June 21st: goods that could come from the north and south, such as glue, paper, and pigments, tended to fall, while goods that could be sold to the south, such as Luan coal and soda ash, rose instead. The price of triangular soda ash in the city on June 27th was 600 yuan higher per bag than at the beginning of the ten-day period, but later fell slightly due to temporary disruptions in sea transportation. The price of matches rose slightly in the middle of the ten-day period due to a shortage of raw materials. The price of door coal also rose under the influence of Luan coal.

　　一旬市况综述
    【本报讯】平市本旬物价一般疲落，至旬末始稍有波动，本旬与上旬比较，粮食类上升八、七三％，副食品类升九、三九％，杂货类升一、九九％，燃料一三、八％，其余则下落，纱布类落○、六○九％，其他工业品落五、八四％。
    粮食——上旬末本市粮价续有上升，故与外埠差额较大。如本旬初（二十一日）北平大米价比天津高出十六元，较张家口高十元八角，较保定（二十二日）高三十元七角五分。北平的通粉价格亦较天津高出七百元，较张家口高四百八十元，较保定（二十二日）高一千四百元。因之形成物资流动，价格相互调节，所以有旬初天津、保定等地粮价上升，北平下落现象。至二十三日华北各地粮价曾普遍转落，其原因综合有以下几点：①华北多数地区落雨，人心趋于安定。②粮源增加，东北、江南、平绥、津浦线等地均有粮食运抵平津。③上海解放后，该地物价低于华北。
    二十一日至二十七日七天中，北平粮价在逐步下落，这是由于北平粮价高于周边各地，致使津、张、唐、保等地商贩纷纷运粮来平，因而粮源增多，一部资金外流。又加上端阳节在即，一般商号及银钱业结帐，市上银根转紧。
    旬末自二十八日后，此间商人见上海虽已解放，但物资未能及时运到，复加二十九日私商乘星期日贸易公司休息机会，在市场兴风作浪，致使粮价又见上升。
    纱布——上海解放后，纱布商纷纷出货，以预备调款南去购货，纱布价格因而连日趋疲，此外外埠纱布价格与平津相较相差无几，来平购货者减少，济南纱布甚至有倒流北运天津现象，至二十七日与旬初比较，二十支三鼎纱每捆落三百五十元，二厂红五福每匹落一千四百元，二十八日纱布情况又因交通关系沪货不能北运，投机商人乘机活动，而转升，旬末较旬初见高。
    什货——受粮食与纱布影响一般亦呈疲落，但由于上海解放，其中有较廿一日不同之处：能由南北来之货如胶料、纸张、颜料等趋落，可以南销之货如滦煤、碱面等反见上升。本市三角碱面二十七日价格较之旬初每袋升达六百元，后因海运一时不能畅通，又稍见回落。火柴因原料缺乏，旬中稍升。门煤因受滦煤牵制亦见上升。
