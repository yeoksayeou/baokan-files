Xinhua News Agency, Hankou, 14th: The Wuhan Military Control Commission invited democratic figures and industrial and commercial circles of the city at 4 p.m. on the 9th to discuss various issues of restoring and developing production, promoting economic prosperity, and building a new Wuhan. More than 120 people attended, including democratic figures, engineers, professors, bank managers, and people from industrial and commercial circles. Tan Zheng, Director of the Military Control Commission, Tao Zhu, Deputy Director, Xiao Jingguang, Commander of the Garrison, Ni Zhiliang, Deputy Commander, Li Xiannian, Chairman of the Hubei Provincial People's Government, and Wu Defeng, Mayor of Wuhan, attended and participated. Director Tan Zheng of the Military Control Commission pointed out in his speech that the common task of the people of Wuhan today, in addition to supporting the front line, is construction. He hoped that everyone would offer more opinions and come up with more ideas. Subsequently, Zhang Nanxian and Li Fanyi, the newly appointed senior advisors to the Military Control Commission, Zhang Yinqiu, a representative of the business community, Li Xiping of the Democratic League, Chen Jingshe, former chairman of the Hankou Chamber of Commerce before the war, Tang Wuyuan, a representative of the Wuhan branch of the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party, and Xiong Ziming, a director of the First Cotton Mill, spoke. They all expressed their support for the economic policy of "developing production, promoting economic prosperity, benefiting both labor and capital, and taking into consideration both public and private interests" proposed by Chairman Mao. They were willing to participate in production and construction with all their strength under the leadership of the Communist Party and the People's Government, and believed that under the leadership of the Communist Party, the various difficulties facing them could be overcome. Finally, Deputy Director Tao Zhu of the Military Control Commission spoke. He said: Wuhan has been revived, the Yangtze River has been opened to navigation, the Han River has been cleared, and the railway is being rushed to repair, and will soon be open to traffic. All of this shows that the People's Government is working actively for the interests of the 1.2 million people of Wuhan, and the material conditions for restoring and building Wuhan have been partially met. Everyone can and should immediately start to restore and develop Wuhan's industry and commerce. Now the work of taking over the Military Control Commission has been largely completed, and the stage of restoration and construction has begun. But it must be pointed out that in carrying out this work, we must first clearly understand the policies of the Chinese Communist Party. The counter-revolutionary elements lurking in Wuhan spread some rumors, deliberately distorting the industrial and commercial policies of the Chinese Communist Party. Some newspapers also maliciously put forward some slogans that are actually counter-revolutionary, such as "Down with the bourgeoisie" and "Anti-capital." We should expose these counter-revolutionary slanders and rumors so that everyone can feel at ease to restore and develop production. Deputy Director Tao then gave a detailed explanation of the industrial and commercial policies of the Chinese Communist Party, stating that under the policy of developing production, promoting economic prosperity, taking into consideration both public and private interests, and benefiting both labor, the Chinese Communist Party allows the existence and development of private capital that is beneficial to the national economy and people's livelihood, resolutely protects private property rights, and guarantees the legitimate profits of private industrialists and businessmen. Deputy Director Tao pointed out that private industry and commerce account for a large proportion in Wuhan. If private industry and commerce cannot be quickly restored and developed, it will be difficult to restore and build a new Wuhan. However, the industrial and commercial circles must also realize that we allow industrialists and businessmen to be profitable, but we oppose illegal exploitation, because this illegal exploitation hinders the enthusiasm of workers for production and directly affects the improvement of social production. From the perspective of the profitability of the industrial and commercial circles themselves, it is also harmful. Under the above-mentioned general policy of New Democratic industry and commerce, our proposition is domestic free competition, free trade, and freedom of employment, because under the leadership of the People's Government, this freedom should be protected. Director Tao finally emphasized that Wuhan already belongs to the people. The workers of Wuhan, other working people, democratic figures, intellectuals, and industrialists and businessmen all have the responsibility to build Wuhan step by step in accordance with the general policy of New Democracy.

　　武汉军管会邀集各界人士
  　讨论恢复生产问题
    陶副主任解释中共工商业政策
    【新华社汉口十四日电】武汉军管会九日下午四时招待本市民主人士暨工商业界，商讨恢复与发展生产、繁荣经济及建设新武汉的各项问题。到会有民主人士、工程师、教授、银行经理、工商界人士共一百二十余人。军管会主任谭政、副主任陶铸，警备司令萧劲光、副司令倪志亮，湖北省人民政府主席李先念，武汉市长吴德峰等均出席参加。军管会谭政主任在致词中指出，武汉人民今天的共同任务，除了支援前线，就是建设，希望大家多提意见，多想办法。接着发言的有新任军管会高级参议张难先、李范一，商界代表张吟秋，民主同盟李西屏，战前曾任汉口商会会长的陈经畲，中国农工党武汉支部代表唐午园，第一纱厂董事熊子明等，他们对毛主席所提出的“发展生产，繁荣经济，劳资两利，公私兼顾”的经济政策均表拥护，愿在共产党和人民政府领导下，全力参加生产建设，并相信在共产党的领导下，面前摆着的各种困难都是可以克服的。最后由军管会陶铸副主任发言。他说：武汉已经复活了，长江已经通航，汉水已经畅通，铁路正在赶修，不久就可通车，这一切都说明人民政府正在为着武汉一百二十万人民的利益积极努力工作，恢复与建设武汉的物质条件，已经部分具备，大家可以而且应该马上动手来恢复与发展武汉的工商业。现在军管会的接管工作已大体完成，恢复与建设的工作阶段业已开始。但是必须指出，在进行这个工作的时候，首先必须明确认识中国共产党的政策。潜伏在武汉的反革命分子散布了一些谣言，故意曲解中国共产党的工商业政策，有些报纸也恶意地提出一些实际上是反革命的口号，如“打倒资产阶级”，“反资本”等。我们应当揭露这些反革命的诽谤和谣言，使大家安心恢复和发展生产。陶副主任接着对中国共产党的工商业政策作了详细的解释，说明在发展生产、繁荣经济、公私兼顾、劳资两利的方针下，中国共产党允许有益于国民生计的私人资本的存在和发展，坚决保护私人财产权，保障私人工商业家的合法利润。陶副主任指出：武汉私人工商业占很大的比例，如不使私人工商业能很快的恢复与发展，恢复与建设新武汉是困难的。但工商界也必须认识我们是允许工商业主有利可图的，但我们反对非法的剥削，因为这种非法的剥削，妨害工人生产的积极性，直接影响到社会生产的提高，从工商业界营利本身来说，也是有害的，在上述新民主主义工商业的总方针之下，我们的主张是国内自由竞争，自由贸易与雇佣自由，因为在人民政府的领导下，这种自由是应该保护的。陶主任最后强调说，武汉已经属于人民。武汉的工人，其他劳动人民，民主人士，知识分子，工商业家都有责任把武汉按照新民主主义的总方针，有步骤地建设起来。
