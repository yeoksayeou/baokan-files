Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 26th: Newspapers in Ping, Jin (Tianjin) and Shanghai published articles on the 20th and 22nd successively, supporting the establishment of the Preparatory Committee for the New Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC). The Guangming Daily, the organ of the China Democratic League in Beiping, stated in its editorial: The official establishment of the Preparatory Committee for the New CPPCC in Beiping signifies the first great unity of the entire Chinese people, marking the first step on the road to democratic nation-building. The newspaper used historical facts since the Xinhai Revolution to prove that without the leadership of the proletariat and with the worker-peasant masses as the foundation, China's transformation into a truly independent, free, prosperous, and powerful nation would remain a mere dream. It continued: If the people of the whole country truly unite, and all classes, parties, and people from all walks of life act in unison under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, as demonstrated in the Preparatory Committee for the New CPPCC, China's democratic nation-building will surely succeed. The Tianjin Progressive Daily said: There are many parties and organizations participating in the New CPPCC, as well as representatives from all regions of the country, representatives of ethnic minorities, and representatives of overseas Chinese. Its universality is no less than that of the National People's Congress. From this, a united government representing the whole country should be produced. We hope and believe that this united government can be established quickly. A brand new, unified People's Democratic Republic of China is approaching the people of the whole country, and the whole world has seen it. The Shanghai Wenhui Daily stated in its editorial: The first plenary session of the Preparatory Committee for the New CPPCC laid the foundation for planning the New CPPCC for the establishment of a new China. This is the most glorious page in the history of the Chinese democratic movement. The people of the whole country are convinced that the New CPPCC will create the first country of the people themselves in Chinese history. The Shanghai Ta Kung Pao stated in its editorial: The convening of the Preparatory Committee for the New CPPCC is a decisive political victory for the Chinese people. The most important thing in the future is for the people of the whole country and all democratic parties to unite and struggle on the common political basis pointed out by Chairman Mao, to be vigilant against the new conspiracies of imperialism and the Kuomintang reactionaries after their disastrous defeat, to completely eliminate the reactionaries, and to enable all of China to break away from the clutches of the enemy as soon as possible.

　　平津沪报纸著论拥护召开新政协
    【新华社北平二十六日电】平、津和上海报纸于二十日和二十二日相继著论拥护新政协筹备会的成立。北平民主同盟机关报光明日报社论说：新政治协商会议筹备会在北平正式宣告成立，这表示全中国人民破天荒第一次大团结，向民主建国的大路跨上了第一步。该报以辛亥革命以来的历史事实证明说：没有无产阶级的领导和以工农大众为基础，中国要变成真正独立自由富强的大国家，只是一种梦想。继说：要是全国人民真正团结起来，全国各阶级各党派各界人士，在中国共产党领导之下一致行动，象在新政协筹备会中所表现的那样，中国民主建国一定成功。天津进步日报说：参加新政协的党派和团体很多，又有全国各区域的代表，有少数民族的代表，有海外华侨的代表，其普遍性不下于全国人民代表会议，由此应可产生一个代表全国的联合政府，我们希望并相信这个联合政府可以很快的成立。一个崭新的统一的中华人民民主共和国，足音跫然，走到全国人民的面前，全世界都看见了。上海文汇报社论说：新政协筹备会首届全体会议，为规划建立新中国的新政协举行了奠基礼。这是中国民主运动史上最辉煌的一页。全中国人民确信新政协将要创造中国历史上第一个人民自己的国家。上海大公报社评说：新政协筹备会的召开是中国人民在政治上的决定胜利。今后最重要的，就是全国人民、各民主党派在毛主席所指出的共同政治基础上团结奋斗，警惕帝国主义和国民党反动派惨败后的新阴谋，彻底消灭反动派，使全中国早日脱离敌人的魔掌。
