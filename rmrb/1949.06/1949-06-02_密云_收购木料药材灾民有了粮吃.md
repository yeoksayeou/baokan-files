　　Purchasing Timber and Medicinal Herbs Provides Grain for Disaster Victims

　　[Jidong Dispatch] The Miyun County Public Store is purchasing large quantities of timber and medicinal herbs to support the production of disaster-stricken people. Most of the county is mountainous. Due to the long-term devastation and destruction by the Japanese invaders and Kuomintang bandits, coupled with a poor harvest last autumn, many households lack food during this year's spring plowing. The 14th Special Prefecture allocated 80,000 catties of millet to organize the masses to produce and help themselves. It also formed a working group to conduct in-depth investigations and understanding. Based on the severity of the disaster and the production situation of the masses, it separately established pharmaceutical factories and lumber yards to purchase timber and medicinal herbs. Taking the village as a unit, production teams were formed under the voluntary conditions of the masses, and direct contact was made with the lumber yards and pharmaceutical factories to handle transaction matters. In the seventy or so days after the lumber yard was established, it received more than 5,000 pieces of timber and paid out 30,000 catties of millet, 15,000 catties of corn, more than 100 bolts of homespun cloth, and more than 700 catties of salt. The masses can earn a wage of eight to thirteen catties of rice per day by cutting wood. The pharmaceutical factory collected medicinal herbs and paid out approximately more than 35,000 catties of millet. Nine women in Nanshulin Village, in addition to their household labor, went up the mountains to dig for medicinal herbs, earning ten catties of corn per day. Currently, the livelihood problems of most of the disaster-stricken people have been resolved.

　　[Taiyue Dispatch] In Xishe Natural Village, Jicheng Third District, Party members and cadres mobilized mutual borrowing and assistance, solving the difficulties of seven households that lacked food during planting. During the inspection of planting, it was discovered that seven households, including Li Guohu and ＠Yushan, with twenty-seven people, were currently lacking food and drink and unable to plant. Branch Secretary Comrade Li Denghu convened a discussion among Party members and cadres, calling on everyone to promote the spirit of mutual borrowing and assistance to help them overcome their difficulties. Branch Secretary Li Denghu and three others first lent grain, prompting everyone to collectively lend three stone and five dou of grain, agreeing to return it after the summer harvest, and criticized those who did not cultivate their land properly, educating them to cultivate their land well.
