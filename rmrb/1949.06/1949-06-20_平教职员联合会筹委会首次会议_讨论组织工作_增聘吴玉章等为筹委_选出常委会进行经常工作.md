The funds for the preparatory committee will be temporarily borrowed from the respective schools by the attending preparatory committee members. The Standing Committee will issue a notice to urge all colleges and universities to establish teachers and staff union preparatory committees as soon as possible. The organizational method will be decided by each school itself, and the preparatory committee members will make their best efforts to promote the rapid establishment of unions in each school. When more than two-thirds of the colleges and universities have established teachers and staff unions, and more than two-thirds of the people in each school have participated, the establishment of the Teachers and Staff Union will be announced, and the preparatory meeting will be concluded.
