　　Smash the AFL's Conspiracy to Split, Strive for Unity of German Labor Movement
  　Schurim Discusses the German Trade Union Movement
    [Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 9th] Warsaw (Polish Press Agency): Schurim, a representative of the Free German Trade Union attending the Polish Trade Union Congress, analyzed the activities of the German trade unions in an interview with a Polish Press Agency reporter. He emphasized that the trade unions in the Soviet-occupied zone hope to unite all trade union movements in Germany. A resolution on unification was adopted at the joint conference of trade unions in various occupation zones in February 1948, but this resolution has not been implemented due to Klein and the Social Democratic Party's trade unions. Moreover, the American authorities have prohibited working-class trade unions from operating in the American-occupied zone of Berlin. Leaders of the Free German Trade Union have been subjected to various forms of persecution. The reactionaries have not only used terror against trade union members but have also organized divisive activities. The organization of splitters is called the "Independent Trade Union Opposition," and it receives special subsidies from the reactionary leaders of the American Federation of Labor (AFL). It is known that the AFL has given millions of dollars to Social Democratic Party leader Schumacher to oppose the Free German Trade Union. Staff members of the "Independent Trade Union Opposition" have admitted that they receive 800,000 marks per month for their divisive activities.
    Schurim continued: The Free German Trade Union believes that their main task is to cooperate in the struggle for the democratization of Germany and the realization of the Potsdam Agreement. The rights of trade unions in the Western occupation zones are less than those in Germany under the rule of the German Emperor before 1914. Schurim concluded: The struggle for freedom of trade union activity in the Western occupation zones and for the unity of the German trade union movement is a fundamental factor in the struggle for the democratization of Germany.

　　击破美劳联分裂阴谋　争取德工运统一
  　舒里姆谈德国职工运动
    【新华社北平九日电】波兰通讯社华沙讯：参加波兰职工代表大会的自由德国职工会代表舒里姆在与波兰通讯社记者的谈话中，分析了德国职工会的活动。他强调指出：苏占区的职工会，希望全德一切职工运动统一起来。一九四八年二月在各占领区职工会联合会议上曾通过了统一的决议，但因克莱和社会民主党职工会的缘故，致使这一决议始终未能实行。不仅如此，美国当局还禁止工人阶级职工会在柏林美占区活动，而且，自由德国职工会的领袖们遭受到各种迫害，反动派不但对职工会会员采取了恐怖，同时，还组织分裂活动。分裂者的组织名为“独立职工会反对派”，它受到美国劳工联合会的反动领袖们的特别津贴。已经知道：美国劳联曾给社会民主党党魁舒马赫数百万美元，用以反对自由德国职工会：“独立职工会反对派”工作人员承认，他们每月得到八十万马克用作分裂活动的经费的。
    舒里姆继称：自由德国职工会认为他们主要的任务是在德国民主化与争取实现波茨坦决议的斗争中合作。西方占领区职工会的权利还没有一九一四年前德皇统治下的德国那么多。舒里姆结语称：争取在西方占领区职工会活动的自由与争取德国职工会统一的斗争，是争取德国民主化斗争中基本的因素。
