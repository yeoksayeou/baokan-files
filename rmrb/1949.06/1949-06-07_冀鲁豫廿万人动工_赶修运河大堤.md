[Hebei-Shandong-Henan Dispatch] After months of surveying and preparation, the Grand Canal levee project commenced on May 20th. Along the winding 200-plus li line, 200,000 civilian laborers from Jining, Jiaxiang, Jibei (newly established county), Nanwang, Kunshan and other counties are working intensely to restore the levee. In Kunshan County, more than 18,000 civilian laborers were fully mobilized on the 23rd to restore the levee. Because of ample prior preparation, and the adoption of a free association method to organize labor, and also because wages could be paid in a timely manner, the morale of the civilian laborers is extremely high. Ren Huaiyi and Guo Yunlong of Dongwang Village, Seventh District of Kunshan, are already in their fifties or sixties, but are still actively competing with the young people. They work two hours after dinner before resting, and arrive early in the morning before dawn. As of the 27th, the Kunshan project had completed more than 70 percent of the entire project, and plans are to complete the project in four days. At present, the county leadership is studying the standards for completion and other follow-up issues.

　　冀鲁豫廿万人动工　赶修运河大堤
    【冀鲁豫电】经过数月的勘察准备，运河大堤工程，已于五月二十日开始动工。在二百多里蜿蜒的线上，济宁、嘉祥、济北（新设县）、南旺、昆山等县二十万民工，正紧张的动工复堤。昆山全县一万八千余民工，二十三日全体出动复堤。因事前有充分准备，采取自由结合方式组织力量，工资也能及时发，所以民工情绪非常锐满。昆山七区东王庄任怀义、郭云龙，都已是五、六十岁的人了，还积极的与青年们竞赛。晚饭后工作两个钟头才休息，早上天不明就赶来。昆山工程截至二十七日止，已完成全部工程的百分之七十以上，计划争取在四天内全部完工。目下该县领导上，正研究收工标准以及其他善后等问题。
