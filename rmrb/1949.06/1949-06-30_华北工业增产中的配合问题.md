　　Coordination Problems in North China's Industrial Production Increase
    Zheng Bobin
  　(I)
    Speaking of increasing industrial production in North China, it's truly a complex matter with countless threads, making it hard to know where to begin. However, in a place like North China, with such abundant industrial resources, no problem with labor supply, a relatively large market, and such urgent need for industrial products, why couldn't it embark on the path of industrialization in the old days? Clearly, in the past, imperialism, feudal forces, and bureaucratic capital fundamentally restricted industrial development. Today, these shackles that restrict production development have been removed, and North China's industrial production will certainly have an infinitely bright future.
    After the old shackles have been removed, the existing industries in the liberated areas themselves still have some urgent problems to be solved, and these problems are very complex. For example, how to guide social idle capital into industrial production, how to expand the reproduction of existing industries, how to specifically resolve labor-capital issues under the principle of mutual benefit for both labor and capital, etc., are all very pressing issues. However, what I want to raise here is not these. I always feel that there is an even more important issue, which has special significance for North China: the coordination of the industries themselves. For example, in the coordination of various different industries, in terms of product types or production quantities, can they assist each other and achieve the effect of coordinated development? Within each single industrial production organization, does there exist a situation where the production paces are not in sync? Good industrial coordination is an important condition for the accelerated development of backward industries. Especially in the stage of gradually entering a planned economy, planned and organized coordinated production is even more important. In order to accelerate the process of industrialization, I believe that it is necessary to immediately conduct a detailed inspection of the equipment capabilities, product varieties, and mutual coordination of various industrial organizations.
    (II)
    Why do we think that industrial coordination issues have special importance in North China? We might as well briefly mention the natural environment and historical background of North China's industry. The superiority of North China's industrial construction, in terms of natural conditions, is second only to the Northeast. For the situation of the endowment of certain resources—such as bituminous coal and high-quality iron ore, and the abundance of labor—it is actually even better than the Northeast. According to geographical and resource conditions, North China should be the main center of China's heavy industry, at least the second heavy industrial zone.
    However, from the historical background of North China's industry, the existing industrial base in North China is closely related to the colonial policies of the Japanese invaders. After eight years of Japanese imperialist rule, North China's industry has a strong colonial nature. Although the Japanese second five-year plan in October of the 30th year of the Republic of China (1941) abandoned the past policy of solely extracting resources and changed to a policy of "taking and giving at the same time," starting to "build" industry, basically, North China's industry at that time was still just a link in the so-called China-Japan-"Manchukuo" economic circle, losing its independence.
    The Kuomintang took over the legacy built by the Japanese invaders, but did not change this basic nature. On the contrary, due to the severance of urban-rural relations, the isolation of North China from the Northeast, and more importantly, due to the plunder and division by various competent departments and major bureaucrats, North China's industry was further crippled. Each enterprise lost its basis for development and was on the verge of collapse, unable to even maintain the aforementioned colonial industrial scale. How should these poor existing industries be re-adjusted and coordinated in the future, enhance their due independence and autonomy, and give them a good development environment? This has obviously become one of the themes of the development of industrial production in North China today.
    Here, we give a few concrete examples: The iron smelting equipment in Shijingshan, with an annual output of more than 500,000 tons, does not have appropriate steelmaking equipment to coordinate with it. Compared with the iron making capacity of Shijingshan, the two steel mills in Tianjin and Tangshan are truly insignificant. During the period of Japanese rule, the pig iron in Shijingshan was always transported to Japan as raw material. Now, although the capacity of Shijingshan has been greatly reduced, the steelmaking capacity of Tianjin and Tangshan is even lower, and iron and steel still cannot be coordinated. Similarly, the coordination of steel ingot production and rail steel capacity, the coordination of coal and transportation capacity (the so-called "suffocation" of Kailuan coal production can illustrate this), the coordination of acids, alkalis, and general chemicals, the coordination of bituminous coal and all industries and electricity, and the coordination of electricity and the power needs of all industries, are all worthy of careful consideration. Today, industry has become an organic whole. The lack of a part, or the improper coordination of one or two departments, will not only affect its own development, but also affect the paralysis and paralysis of other industries.
    (III)
    In addition to the coordination between industrial departments, there is also the coordination of various departments in the production process within the same factory. The coordination of the production process mentioned here refers to the equipment capacity and working conditions of the same factory at each production stage, that is, the economic problems of a certain industry itself. For example, in a paper mill in Tianjin, in a series of production processes such as reed cutting, pulp boiling, pulp beating, bleaching, papermaking, and finishing, the lack of equipment in only one part of pulp beating often affects the full play of the production capacity of other departments.
    Similar situations, whether it is the failure of a certain production department to coordinate within the same industry, or the failure of a certain industry to coordinate between various industries, or even expanding the scope, the failure of a certain part of industry and agriculture or other industries to coordinate; this is considered a "bottleneck" phenomenon in industrial economics (this is often a characteristic of a colonial economy). In the case of North China, due to the long-term rule of the Japanese, dividing North China into the Japan-"Manchukuo" economic circle, and the Kuomintang's plundering and division, and the result of assigning some engineering personnel who did not know anything about industrial economics to manage the factories, this bottleneck phenomenon can be found everywhere. What is the significance of the discovery of bottlenecks in industrial economics? This means that in this state, it is necessary to reconsider the production plan. If production is only increased in a certain department, it will inevitably increase production costs and cause a partial surplus of production. This issue is very worthy of attention.
    Under normal circumstances, the state of a sharp increase in production costs mostly occurs when equipment cannot be fully utilized, but in North China, at most, only the equipment in the bottleneck part has been fully used. If the bottleneck limitation affects production costs, then the production plan must first focus on expanding the bottleneck part.
    At present, some industries feel that it is difficult to sell finished products. Increasing social purchasing power cannot be achieved in the short term, and it is equally not easy for industrial production organizations to reduce the average unit cost in variable capital; what industrialists can do now is probably only to try to remove the bottleneck restrictions themselves, make full use of the remaining equipment or reduce some disproportionate costs, in order to achieve the most effective production standards. In the entire social production system, it is naturally also necessary to have a more precise adjustment and arrangement.
    (IV)
    Therefore, in this short article, I especially propose to launch some industrial economic discussions under the call of increasing production and making production one inch longer. Not only does the entire production increase problem need a rigorous production plan, focusing on and developing North China's industry step by step, but also within a certain factory, it is necessary to earnestly solve some specific problems in order to favorably increase production and reduce costs.

　　华北工业增产中的配合问题
    郑伯彬
  　（一）
    说到华北工业的增加生产，真是千头万绪，不知从何说起。但象华北这样的地方，工业资源的赋存那样丰富，劳动力的供给又不成问题，市场也相当广大，工业产品的需要是那么迫切，为什么在旧时代总不能走上工业化的道路呢？很显然的，过去帝国主义、封建势力和官僚资本，根本限制了工业的发展。在今天，这些限制生产发展的桎梏解除了，华北工业生产一定会获得它无限光明的前途的。
    当旧的桎梏已告解除之后，解放后的旧存工业本身还存在着一些亟待解决的问题，这种问题且非常繁复。诸如如何引导社会游资投入工业生产，如何使既有工业扩大再生产，如何在劳资两利的原则下具体的解决劳资问题等等，都是非常迫切的问题。但我在这里所要提出的，还不是这些，我总觉得还有一个更重要，对华北更有特殊意义的工业本身的配合问题。比方说，在各种不同的工业配合上，在产品种类或生产数量上，是否可以互相辅助，收得配合发展的效果？在每个单一的工业生产的机构中，又是否存在着生产步调不合拍节的情形？工业的良好配合，是落后工业加速发展的重要条件。特别是在逐渐步入计划经济的阶段，有计划，有组织的配合生产更显重要。为使工业化的进程加速，我以为对各种工业机构的设备能力和生产品种及相互配合等等有即行从事精密检查的必要。
    （二）
    为什么我们认为工业配合问题在华北有特殊重要的意义呢？我们无妨略为提到华北工业的自然环境和历史背景。华北工业建设的优越性，以自然条件来说，其地位仅次于东北。对某种资源赋存的状况来说——例如烟煤及良质铁砂的赋存，劳动力的丰富——实际还较东北为优。根据地理的和蕴藏的条件，华北应该是我国重工业的主要中心区，至少是第二重工业地带。
    但是，从华北工业的历史背景来说，旧存的华北工业基础却和日寇的殖民地政策有密切关系。经过了八年的日本帝国主义统治，华北工业具有浓厚的殖民地性质。民国三十年十月日人的第二次五年计划，虽然曾经放弃过去专门榨取资源的方针，改为“边取边予”的政策，着手“建设”工业，但是，在基本上，当时华北的工业依然只是所谓中日“满”经济圈内的一环，失掉了它的独立性。
    国民党接收了日寇建设的遗产，并没有把这个基本性质改变，相反的，由于城乡关系的断绝，华北与东北的隔离，更重要的，是由于各主管部门和各大官僚的掠夺割裂，更使华北的工业加深了跛足性，每个事业都失掉了发展的凭借，摇摇欲坠，连上述殖民地性的工业规模也不能维持。这些可怜的既存工业，今后应该怎样重行调整配合，增强其应有的独立自主性，给它一个良好的发展环境，显然成了今日华北工业生产发展的主题之一。
    这里，我们举出几个具体的例子：石景山年产五十余万吨的炼铁设备，并没有适当的炼钢设备配合，天津和唐山两个炼钢厂和石景山的生铁制造能力比较起来，真是缈小得很，在日寇统治期，石景山的生铁一直是作为原料运往日本的。现在石景山的能力虽大为减低，但津唐的炼钢能力更为低下，铁与钢仍不能配合。同样，钢锭生产与轨钢能力的配合，煤与运输能力的配合（开滦煤产发生所谓“涨死”的情形，可以说明），酸碱与一般化工的配合，烟煤和所有工业和电力的配合，以及电力与所有工业的动力需要配合，都是值得缜密考虑的。在今日，工业已经成了一个有机体，缺少了一部分，或者有一二个部门不能配合妥当，其影响都不仅是本身的发展，而且会影响到其他工业的麻痹和瘫痪。
    （三）
    除了工业部门间的配合以外，还有同一工厂内生产过程中各部门的配合问题。这里所说的生产过程中的配合，是指同一工厂在各生产阶段的设备能力和工作情况而说的，也就是某一工业本身的经济问题。例如天津的某家纸厂，在切苇、煮浆、打浆、漂白、造纸、整理等一连串的生产过程里，其中仅由于打浆一部的设备不足，就常常影响到其余部门生产能力的不能充分发挥。
    类似这种情形，无论是同一工业内部某一生产部门的不能配合，或是各种工业间某一工业的不能配合，甚至于更扩大范围来说，工业与农业或其他产业间之某一部分的不能配合；这在工业经济中就认为是一种“瓶颈”现象（这往往是殖民地经济的特征）。华北的情形，由于日人的长期统治，把华北划入日“满”经济圈，以及国民党的劫收分割，派用一些不知工业经济为何物的工程人员管理工厂的结果，这种瓶颈现象，到处都可以发现。瓶颈的发现，在工业经济中有什么意义呢？这就是表示在这状态下，必需重新考虑生产计划，假使只就某一部门一味提高生产，必将增加生产成本，并发生局部生产过剩的现象。这个问题是非常值得注意的了。
    在普通的情形下，生产成本遽增的状态，多半发生于设备不能充分利用的时候，但在华北则充其量只是瓶颈部分的设备已经充分使用而已。假使瓶颈的限制影响了生产成本，那末，关于生产的计划就必需首先着手于瓶颈部分的扩大。
    在目前，有些工业感到成品销售困难。提高社会购买力并不是短期内所能做到的，工业生产机构方面，减低可变资本中的平均单位费用，也同样不太容易；现在工业家所能做到的，恐怕只有设法解除本身的瓶颈限制，充分利用其余的设备或者减少一些不相称的费用，以达到那最有效的生产标准。在整个社会的生产体系来说，自然也同样有更加精密调整安排的必要。
    （四）
    因此，在这篇短文里，我特别提出，在增加生产，使生产长一寸的号召下，热烈展开一些工业经济的讨论。不仅在整个增产问题上需要一个严密的生产计划，有重点，有步骤的发展华北工业，即在某一工厂内，也需要切实的解决一些具体的问题，借以有利的提高生产，减低成本。
