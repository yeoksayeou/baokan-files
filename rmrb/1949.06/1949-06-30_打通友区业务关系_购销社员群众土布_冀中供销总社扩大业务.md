　　【Jizhong Telegram】Since its formal establishment in April, the Jizhong Supply and Marketing Cooperative has actively expanded its business. It has successively opened up business relations with Jilin Province in Northeast China and Chahar Province, selling large quantities of local cloth from Gaoyang and other places to the Northeast and purchasing a large amount of coarse grains, which has alleviated the living difficulties of many cooperative members and the masses. Since the liberation of Pingjin, the brisk sales of advanced industrial products has meant that the lives of those in Jizhong who rely on handicrafts and sideline production are in urgent need of help. The Jizhong Supply and Marketing Cooperative first opened up business relations with the Chahar Provincial Supply and Marketing Cooperative, and then purchased a portion of foreign yarn from the Tianjin Zhonglan Company through the Jizhong Trading Company, supplying it to weaving households. It also purchased 18,000 bolts of local cloth from cooperative members and the masses in Ding County at a price of ten yuan per bolt higher than the market price, and sold them to Chahar Province. The Gaoyang Xingye Store had 2,460 bolts of local cloth in stock that could not be sold. The Jizhong Supply and Marketing Cooperative, through the Jizhong Trading Company, also opened up business relations with the supply and marketing cooperatives of Jilin, Qiqihar and other cities in Northeast China, and sold this batch of stock cloth. At the same time, it purchased a large amount of coarse grains from the Northeast. It also agreed to sell another 2,000 bolts of Gaoyang cloth to the Jilin Provincial Supply and Marketing Cooperative. One and a half million catties of coarse grains have now been shipped from the Northeast and distributed to the supply and marketing cooperatives of Ding County, Shenze, Anguo, Boye, Lixian, Qingyuan, Anxin, Baoshi, Xianxian, Anci and other counties, and sold to cooperative members and the masses at low prices. Cooperative members buying grain pay twenty yuan less per斗 than the market price; the masses buying grain are also given a reduction. In the context of such active management and solving the difficulties of the masses, the broad masses have recognized the benefits of cooperatives. Many people in Ding County directly approached the provincial supply and marketing cooperative, requesting to join the cooperative. They said happily: "Joining the supply and marketing cooperative is much cheaper even if there are no dividends." Now the supply and marketing cooperatives in various parts of Jizhong are actively expanding their business, preparing to open up more sales channels, widely sell the local agricultural products of Jizhong farmers, and help farmers successfully overcome disasters.

    【冀中电】冀中供销总社，自四月份正式成立以后，积极扩大业务。先后与东北吉林省及察哈尔省，打通了业务关系，大量将高阳等地土布推销于东北，购回大批粗粮，解除了不少社员和群众的生活困难。自平津解放后，由于先进的工业品畅销，冀中各地靠手工业和副业生产为生者其生活急待帮助解决。冀中供销总社遂首先与察哈尔省供销总社，打通业务关系，然后通过冀中贸易公司，从天津中篮公司买来一部洋纱，供给了织布户；并以每匹布高于市价十元的价格收买了定县社员和群众的土布一万八千匹，推销到察哈尔省。高阳兴业商店，旧存土布二千四百六十匹，无法推销，也经冀中供销总社通过冀中贸易公司，与东北吉林、齐齐哈尔等市供销社，打通了业务关系，将此批存布推销出去。同时并从东北购来大批粗粮；复商定再以高阳布二千匹售与吉林省供销总社。现已由东北运来粗粮一百五十万斤，分运定县、深泽、安国、博野、蠡县、清苑、安新、保市、献县、安次等县供销社，低价售给社员和群众，社员买粮每斗低于市价二十元；群众买粮也予减低。在这样积极经营，解决群众困难的情况下，使广大群众认识了合作社的好处。定县许多群众直接找到省供销社，要求入社。他们都高兴的说：“参加供销社不分红也便宜多呀，”现在冀中各地供销社，正在积极扩大业务，准备打通更多的销路关系，广泛的推销冀中农民土产品，帮助农民胜利渡过灾荒。
