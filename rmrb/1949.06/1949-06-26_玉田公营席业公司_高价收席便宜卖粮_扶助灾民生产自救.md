　　Helping Disaster Victims Produce and Save Themselves
　　[Tangshan Telegraph] The Yutian County Eighth District Lin Nancang Public-Operated Mat Industry Company is purchasing mats and selling grain on a large scale to help the masses in the disaster area with production. The Yutian Eighth District is near the Ji Canal and is a flood-affected area. Due to continuous canal excavation and water discharge, land in the Yangliu New Canal Cangwa area that had been submerged for eight to twelve years has been completely reclaimed. The production enthusiasm of the farmers has generally increased, but due to long-term suffering from floods, life is very difficult. Most farmers rely on weaving mats to maintain their livelihoods. Since its establishment in the spring of 1946, the town's mat industry company has taken helping the masses overcome disasters through mat purchasing and grain selling as its primary business. This spring, to minimize the impact of price fluctuations on the masses and facilitate timely sowing, it continuously purchased more than 630,000 jin of corn and 179,000 jin of red sorghum from other places before the spring plowing, while simultaneously purchasing mats and selling grain. According to incomplete statistics from April and May, it purchased a total of 40,000 rolls of mats and sold 423,140 jin of corn and more than 24,000 jin of red and white sorghum. To help farmers rush to plant late crops, the original grain price, which was sold at about 95% of the market price, was reduced to 87.5%. The purchase price of mats always remained 1% to 3% higher than the market price. Farmers in various villages quickly sold their products and bought grain at cheaper prices. In a short period, all of the more than 30,000 mu of land in the district that could not be sown immediately due to drought have been planted with the support of the mat industry company and the leadership of the district government.

  　高价收席便宜卖粮
  　扶助灾民生产自救
    【唐山电】玉田县八区林南仓公营席业公司大量收席卖粮，扶助灾区群众生产。玉田八区临近蓟运河是水灾区，由于连年开渠泄水，杨柳新渠仓洼一带被淹没八年到十二年的土地，已全部脱出，农民生产情绪普遍提高，但因长期遭受水患，生活十分困苦，一般农民多依靠织席维持生活。该镇席业公司自一九四六年春成立以来，即以收席卖粮帮助群众渡灾为主要业务。今春为使群众少受物价波动影响，及时下种，自春耕前即从外地连续购进玉米六十三万余斤，红粮十七万九千余斤，一面收席，一面卖粮。四、五两月不完全统计，共收席达四万领，售出玉米四十二万三千一百四十斤，红、白高粮等二万四千余斤。为帮助农民抢种晚出，把原来按市价百分之九十五左右出售的粮价降低到百分之八十七点五出售。收席则始终保持高于市价百分之一至百分之三，各村农民很快卖出自己的产品，并用便宜价钱买到粮食。并在短期内，全区因天旱未能即时下种的三万余亩地，在席业公司的支持和区政府的领导下已全部下种。
