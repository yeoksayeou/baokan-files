(Jinan Electric) Qinghe and other places are carrying out a thrift campaign during the summer harvest season, proposing to "save from the top of the granary, not the bottom." They patiently educate the masses. In the past, after the wheat harvest, farmers in Huangjinzhuang, Qinghe, would eat three meals of dumplings and four meals of soup, as well as steamed buns, oiled salt cakes, etc. To break this old habit of eating whatever is harvested, the village branch of the Communist Party held a branch committee meeting on May 28 to study thrift and prepare for famine. They assigned Party members and cadres to be responsible for specific wheat fields, conducting education and mobilization during evening breaks. Branch Secretary Pan Bao went to mobilize Shi Huizhen, explaining that one jin of wheat could be exchanged for two jin of sorghum, one jin of wheat flour could be steamed into one jin and four liang of steamed buns, while one jin of sorghum could be steamed into one jin and fourteen liang of cornbread, with a difference of more than half between saving and wasting. He also explained that saving is to prevent famine for oneself, so it is necessary to "save from the top of the granary, not the bottom." After his patient persuasion, Shi Huizhen, Shi Guofang, Shi Xingmian, and others understood, and stopped the phenomenon of exchanging wheat for steamed buns and fried dough twists. Seventeen households exchanged new wheat for sorghum to eat, and other households also planned to eat less white flour and not waste wheat. Farmers in the Third and Fourth Districts also actively purchased and exchanged for coarse grains. Ru Qiaoniang from Housunzhuang in a certain district calculated that they could not last until autumn if they only ate wheat, but they could eat until the end of September if they exchanged for coarse grains. Therefore, she exchanged all but the wheat seeds and necessary food for sorghum. Yongzhi, Zhentang, Baixiang and other counties universally collected edible tree leaves and wild vegetables to prepare for famine before the wheat harvest. The Zhentang County Committee called on people to be thrifty during the wheat harvest, to collect substitutes for food before the wheat harvest, and to combine all sideline industries such as weaving, transportation, and spinning with summer planting and summer hoeing after the wheat harvest without stopping, in order to prepare for disasters.

　　打破收麦吃麦旧习
    清河等地开展节约
    【冀南电】清河等地趁夏收时节开展节约运动，提出“省囤尖不省囤底。”耐心教育群众。清河黄金庄农民每当麦收后，要吃三顿饺子四顿汤，还吃些蒸馍馍、油盐饼等，该村支部为打破这种收啥吃啥的旧习惯，于五月二十八日召开支委会，研究节约备荒，布置党员干部按麦场为单位分片负责，趁晚上休息时进行教育动员。支书潘保去动员史会珍，说明一斤麦能换二斤高粱，一斤麦面蒸一斤四两馍馍，而一斤高粱能蒸一斤十四两窝窝，一省一费相差过半。并说明节约是为自己防荒，因此要“省囤尖，不省囤底”。在他耐心说服下，史会珍、史国方、史兴眠等都想通了，停止了用麦子换馍馍、馃子吃的现象。并有十七户用新麦子换高粱吃，其他户也打算少吃白面不浪费麦子。三、四两区农民也纷纷购换粗粮，某区后孙庄汝乔娘计算光吃麦子熬不到秋天，换成粗粮就能吃到九月底，因此她除留下麦种与必要吃用外，全换为高粱。永智、振堂、柏乡等县麦收前普遍采集可食的树叶、野菜备荒。振堂县委会号召过麦时省吃俭用，麦前采集代食品，麦后一切编织、运输、纺织副业结合夏种夏锄不歇业，以备灾荒。
