Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 4th: The Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang has recently issued a proclamation to former Nanjing Kuomintang system members. The full text is as follows:

　　Since the People's Liberation Army marched into southern China, it has only been forty days, and it has already liberated all or most of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, Jiangxi, and Hubei; it has occupied major cities such as Nanjing, Hangzhou, Wuhan, and Nanchang; and its vanguard has reached the northwest of Fujian. The Chiang Kai-shek reactionay group's attempt to make a last desperate stand in Shanghai with the remnants of its army, navy, and air force has also been defeated miserably. It finally had to abandon this largest metropolis, the political and economic center where imperialism and reactionary Chinese rule colluded to oppress and exploit the Chinese people, with a population of six million. Wherever the People's Liberation Army arrives, the people welcome them with food and drink; even in areas still ruled by the Chiang Kai-shek reactionary group, people from all walks of life hope that the People's Liberation Army will arrive soon. These facts show that the remaining forces of the Chiang Kai-shek reactionary group will soon be completely eliminated, and that the Chiang Kai-shek reactionary group's attempt to establish a small, isolated regime in Guangzhou, Chongqing, Taiwan, or elsewhere is absolutely impossible.

　　In the past era of warlord melee, there was still the possibility of a comeback for the defeated. Now, this is a war in which the awakened masses of the people rise up to break free from the shackles of feudalism and imperialism, a war in which the awakened masses of the people rise up to demand their own liberation and survival. The awakening of the masses of the people is becoming more and more widespread, and the strength of the masses of the people is becoming more and more powerful. Therefore, the dictatorial and traitorous Chiang Kai-shek reactionary group that has been overthrown will forever become "dead ashes" and will never "revive."

　　But as long as the Chiang Kai-shek reactionary group is not completely dead, it will not stop its actions of harming the country and the people. We only need to look at the recent declarations and "Letters to Compatriots Across the Country" issued by the bogus Central Executive Committee and bogus President Li Zongren in Guangzhou, especially the declaration of the "China Anti-Aggression Grand Alliance" concocted by Yan Xishan and others, which is truly full of absurdities, turning right and wrong upside down. Their so-called "fighting for national independence and autonomy" is actually implementing the aggressive policies of American imperialism, using American-made planes and cannons to massacre the Chinese people. Their so-called "fighting for the people's free way of life" is actually constantly arresting, massacring, looting supplies, extorting wealth, issuing banknotes indiscriminately, and conscripting grain and laborers in the areas they occupy. What we should especially point out is that their dream of a third world war is actually the last self-deceiving fantasy when they are completely defeated and know that there is no way out. Because the imperialists, headed by the United States and Britain, who clamor for war, are outwardly strong but inwardly weak; while the socialist and new democratic countries and the people of the world, headed by the Soviet Union, who insist on peace, are growing stronger and stronger, and the movement to defend peace is becoming more and more widespread. In addition, the rapid and great revolutionary victory of our 475 million Chinese people has made the peace camp even more powerful. The paper tiger imperialists weigh the pros and cons and dare not act rashly. Therefore, this set of daydreaming rumors and deceptions by the Chiang Kai-shek reactionary group originally only wanted to fool and coerce you and the broad masses of the people to risk your lives for them, but all the facts themselves have already clearly told you and the broad masses of the people the division between right and wrong, benefit and harm, good fortune and misfortune, and life and death.

　　As for the like of Li Zongren and He Yingqin, when they were in Nanjing, they could have changed their minds, accepted the peace agreement, rendered meritorious service to the people, redeemed their sins, and striven for the opportunity to serve the country and the people in the future. Who would have thought that they would be obsessed and always act as the running dogs of the American Empire and the tools of Chiang Kai-shek. Now the People's Liberation Army is approaching Guangzhou with the force of a bamboo splitting, and it is foreseeable that the reactionary remnants can be thoroughly eliminated soon.

　　Broad masses of Kuomintang members! From the perspective of right and wrong, you should not follow the Chiang Kai-shek reactionary group, who betrayed the people and betrayed Mr. Sun Yat-sen. From the perspective of interests, you should not follow the Chiang Kai-shek reactionary group, who are about to perish, into the grave. The four major families and their lackeys have plundered the people's wealth for more than 20 years, possessing hundreds of millions of dollars, and can seek refuge in imperialism and live out their lives overseas. What about you? You still have to rely on the people who oppose dictatorship and treason, and rely on the people's government. Therefore, your only way out is to join the people's ranks, join the democratic revolutionary camp, and do your best in the work of eliminating the remnants of the Chiang Kai-shek reactionary group.

　　The People's Liberation Army or guerrillas will soon be near you. If you are serving in the army, you must contact the People's Liberation Army or guerrillas, or revolt on the spot, or lead your troops to defect to the liberated areas and guerrilla areas. If you are serving in the local government, you must welcome the People's Liberation Army or guerrillas in and jointly maintain local order and protect the various interests of the people. If you are serving in economic or cultural institutions, you must unite the staff and workers, unite the masses, and preserve all the materials and documents, waiting for the takeover. In this way, you will have rendered meritorious service to the people, and the People's Government will surely arrange work for you based on your merits and abilities.

　　The Chiang Kai-shek reactionary group has committed countless crimes and has long been abandoned by the people of the country. You have been perfunctory and have not yet been able to rise up to resist and sever ties with it. A little self-reflection should bring shame. In the past, the Chiang Kai-shek reactionary group wielded its huge evil power to impose cruel control, which could still be excused. Now that this evil power has been shattered, it is your last chance to extricate yourselves! We sincerely hope that you will quickly and thoroughly awaken, and deeply understand that the development of the revolutionary Three People's Principles should have reached the stage of consistency with New Democracy. Only by standing under the banner of the revolutionary Three People's Principles, that is, New Democracy, accepting our call, serving the people wholeheartedly, and jointly struggling to thoroughly eliminate the remaining reactionary forces and build an independent, free, democratic, unified, and prosperous New China!

### 中国国民党革命委员会发表　告前南京国民党系统党员书

　　中国国民党革命委员会发表
  　告前南京国民党系统党员书
    【新华社北平四日电】中国国民党革命委员会顷发表告前南京国民党系统党员书，全文如下：
    自从人民解放军进军江南，距今不过四十天，已解放了江苏、浙江、安徽、江西、湖北之全部或大部；已占领了南京、杭州、武汉、南昌诸大都市；前锋已达到福建之西北部；蒋介石反动集团纠合其陆海空军的残余在上海作最后孤注一掷的企图，亦已惨败，终于不能不放弃这个拥有六百万人口的作为帝国主义与中国反动统治勾结起来压迫剥削中国人民的政治经济中心的最大都市。解放军所到之处，老百姓无不箪食壶浆以迎；即在蒋介石反动集团仍然统治的地方，各界民众亦无不盼望解放军快点到来。这些事实，说明了蒋介石反动集团的残余势力很快就会被完全消灭，说明了蒋介石反动集团企图在广州、重庆、台湾或其他地方作偏安的小朝廷，也绝无可能。
    在过去军阀混战局面，失败者或还有死灰复燃的可能，现在是觉悟了的人民大众起来挣脱封建主义和帝国主义的枷锁的战争，是觉悟了的人民大众起来要求自己翻身与生存的战争。人民大众的觉悟是愈来愈普遍，人民大众的力量是愈来愈雄厚，因而被打倒的独裁卖国的蒋介石反动集团，将永远变为“死灰”，绝不可能“复燃”的了。
    但蒋介石反动集团只要它还未全部僵死，是不会停止其祸国殃民的行动的。我们只要看最近广州伪中央执委会与伪总统李宗仁还在发宣言及“告全国同胞书”，尤其是阎锡山等搞的“中国反侵略大同盟”的宣言，真是满纸荒唐，颠倒是非。他们所谓“为民族独立自主而战”，实际上是奉行美帝国主义的侵略政策，用美制的飞机大炮，残杀中国人民。他们所谓“为人民自由生活方式而战”实际上是在他们所盘踞的地方，到处不断逮捕屠杀，抢夺物资，搜刮民财，滥发钞票，征粮拉夫。我们应该特别指出的是，他们寤寐以求的世界第三次大战，实际上是在他们全盘失败自知绝无出路之时，最后的一种自欺欺人的幻想。因为叫嚣战争的、以美英为首的帝国主义是外强中干；坚持和平以苏联为首的社会主义与新民主主义国家及全世界人民，则力量日益增强，保卫和平的运动日益普遍，再加上我们四万万七千五百万中国人民迅速获得伟大的革命胜利，更使得和平阵营势力雄厚。纸老虎的帝国主义权衡利害，愈不敢轻举妄动。所以蒋介石反动集团这一套白日见鬼的造谣欺骗，本来只想愚弄和裹胁你们与广大的人民为他们拼命，可是一切事实本身，早已经清清楚楚地告诉了你们和广大人民，是非利害，吉凶祸福与生死存亡的分野了。
    至于李宗仁何应钦之流，当他们在南京的时候，本可以翻然改图，接受和平协定，为人民立功，为自己赎罪，争取将来为国家人民服务的机会。谁想他们是执迷不悟，始终作为美帝的走狗、蒋介石的工具。现在解放大军正以破竹之势，直趋广州，眼看着反动残余指日就可彻底肃清了。
    广大的国民党党员们！从是非来说，你们不应该附从背叛人民、背叛孙中山先生的蒋介石反动集团。从利害上说，你们也不应该跟着立即灭亡的蒋介石反动集团走进坟墓。四大家族及其走狗二十多年来搜括民膏，腰缠亿万可以托庇于帝国主义，终老海外。你们呢？你们还是要依靠反独裁卖国的人民，依靠人民的政府的。因此，你们的出路只有一条：投到人民的队伍来，投到民主革命的阵营来，在消灭蒋介石反动集团的残余这一工作上尽你们的能力。
    人民解放军或游击队，很快就会临近你们，你们如果是在军队服务，就必须与解放军或游击队联络或就地起义，或率队投奔解放区和游击区。你们如果是在地方政府服务，就必须把解放军或游击队欢迎进来，共同维持地方秩序，保护人民的种种利益。你们如果是在经济的或文化的机关服务，就必须团结职工，联合民众，保全所有的物资文献，等待接管。这样，你们就算为人民立了功，将来人民政府，必然依据你们的功绩和能力，为你们安排工作。
    蒋介石反动集团罪恶累累，早为国人所共弃，而你们因循苟且，至今尚未能起来反抗，与之割绝，稍一自省，应有惭疚。在过去，蒋介石反动集团挟其巨大的恶势力作残酷的钳制，犹可推诿，现在这种恶势力已被粉碎，是你们最后的自拔的时机！我们很诚恳地希望你们赶快彻底觉悟，深切地理解到革命的三民主义的发展，应该是已经到了与新民主主义的一致的阶段。你们只有站在革命的三民主义亦即是新民主主义的旗帜之下，接受我们的号召，全心全意为人民服务，共同为彻底肃清残余反动势力，建设独立、自由、民主、统一、繁荣的新中国而奋斗！
