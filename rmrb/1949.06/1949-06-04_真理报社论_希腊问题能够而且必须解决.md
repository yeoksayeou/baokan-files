  　The Greek Problem Can and Must Be Solved
    (Continued from yesterday)
    No one can deny that this plan contains not only a suitable suggestion, but also a practical suggestion, and its realization will mean the end of the Greek crisis. As is well known, the Greek Provisional Democratic Government, which reflects the true interests of the people, issued a peace declaration in early April of this year, solemnly declaring its desire and readiness to stop the civil war.
    TASS published the Soviet government's proposed measures to put the Greek situation on the right track. The world's democratic public is satisfied. They see in this proposal an opportunity to end the bloody war provoked by imperialist forces in Greece.
    A United Press correspondent in Washington recently pointed out: "As diplomats say, the Russian statement creates the impression that Russia is willing to reach a fair solution to the Greek problem." In London, according to The Times, it is generally believed that the Soviet government's proposal "should be carefully studied."
    Therefore, it is strange that the official statements on the Greek issue simultaneously issued by the US State Department and the British Foreign Office spokespersons in Washington and London on May 20th. On the one hand, these statements attempt to almost deny the two true facts that negotiations have been held between the representatives of the three countries and that the negotiations were initiated by the United States and Britain. However, the State Department spokesperson's statement also pointed out that on April 26th of this year, the US Assistant Secretary of State consulted with the head of the Soviet delegation to the UN General Assembly and "expressed the hope that the three governments would use their influence to achieve a solution to the Greek problem so that the Greek people could focus their attention on the construction of their country"; the British Minister of State was also present at the time. Further meetings on the Greek issue were held on May 4th and 14th.
    It is also very peculiar that the statements by the US State Department and the British Foreign Office spokespersons do not provide any direct response to the specific Soviet proposals. On the contrary, the State Department pointed out that the United States is prepared to discuss many issues with the Soviet Union in a proper manner; as for the Greek issue, it is a matter for the United Nations to handle, and the Greek government should fully participate in the discussion of the issue.
    The inconsistent and contradictory line taken by the US State Department and the British Foreign Office spokespersons is reflected in what the New York Herald Tribune called "a certain sense of embarrassment," which has been evident in US and British government officials since TASS published the Soviet statement on the Greek issue. It does not surprise anyone that the Greek royalist fascist newspapers are trying to make a big fuss about the negotiations on the Greek issue that have been held between the three countries. The reactionary forces in Athens are also talking about their so-called "solution" to the Greek problem. This "solution" lies in further inciting civil war and a policy of terror, in demanding that the great powers recognize that "the Communist Party must not be legalized," in demanding the unconditional surrender of the Democratic Army, etc.
    The road to truly overcoming the Greek crisis is completely clear. Its outline has been put forward in the Soviet proposals.
    It is impossible to solve the Greek problem with diplomatic tricks that divert people's attention away from the main essence of the basic issues that constitute Greece.
    According to an Associated Press reporter, "As to whether the United States agrees with the Soviet peace terms, the question remains open." What does this mean? Does this not mean that the US and British governments have no intention of accelerating the Greek situation on the right track and would rather maintain the "status quo" in the future? But the Greek "status quo" is: bloody civil war, thousands of victims, rivers of blood, the hardships of the masses, economic disasters, and increasingly tense relations between Greece and other countries.
    Real life demands clear answers to clear questions.
    The Greek problem not only can but must be resolved in accordance with the interests of the Greek people and in accordance with the interests of peace and international security. (TASS Moscow, May 30th)

### 真理报社论　希腊问题能够而且必须解决

  　希腊问题能够而且必须解决
    （续昨）
    没有人能否认这一方案包含着不仅是一种适宜的建议，而且也是实际的建议，它的实现将意味希腊危机的结束。如所周知，反映人民真正利益的希腊临时民主政府，在本年四月初发表了和平声明，庄严地声明它愿望和准备停止内战。　　
    塔斯社发表了苏联政府提出的使希腊情势走入正轨的措施方案。全世界的民主公众均表满意。他们在这一建议中看到了结束帝国主义势力在希腊所挑起的血腥战争的机会。
    合众社驻华盛顿记者最近曾指出：“正如外交人员所说的，俄国的声明造成一种印象，即俄国愿意达成希腊问题的公正解决。”在伦敦，用泰晤士报的说法，一般认为苏联政府的建议“是应该受到仔细研讨的”。
    所以，奇怪的是：美国务院及英外交部发言人于五月二十日在华盛顿与伦敦就希腊问题同时发表的官方声明所产生的印象。一方面，这些声明企图几乎否认谈判已在三国代表间举行以及谈判是美英发起的这两个真实的事实。然而，国务院发言人的声明同时又指出：本年四月二十六日，美国助理国务卿与苏联出席联大代表团团长进行交涉，并“表示希望三国政府利用他们的影响达成希腊问题的解决，以使希腊人民可以集中他们的注意于他们国家的建设”；当时英国国务大臣亦在场。五月四日及十四日进一步举行了希腊问题的会议。
    美国国务院及英外交部发言人的声明中，没有对苏联具体的建议作出任何直接的答复，这也是很特别的。相反地，国务院却指出，美国已准备与苏联以相当的形式讨论许多问题；至于希腊问题，那是由联合国来处理的事，而且希腊政府应该充分参加该问题的讨论。
    美国务院与英外交部发言人所采取的这个前后不一、自相矛盾的路线，反映在纽约先驱论坛报所谓“某种尴尬感觉”中，这种感觉在美英政府人士自塔斯社发表苏联对希腊问题建议的声明以来，便可以看得出来。希腊保皇法西斯报纸试图对三国就希腊问题已举行的谈判大吵大闹，这并不使任何人感到惊奇。雅典反动派又谈述他们那所谓“解决”希腊问题的方案。这个“方案”在于进一步煽动内战和恐怖政策，在于要求大国承认“共产党不得合法化”，在于要求民主军无条件投降等等。
    走向真正克服希腊危机的道路是完全明白的。其纲要已在苏联的建议中提出。
    用转移人们视线，使之不注意构成希腊基本问题的主要本质的各种外交诡计，是不能解决希腊问题的。
    据美联社记者所说，“至于美国是否赞成苏联的和平条款的问题，仍是悬而未决的。”这是什么意思呢？这不是意味着美英政府无意使希腊情势加速走上正轨而宁愿将来也维持“现状”吗？但是希腊“现状”是：血腥的内战、数以千计的受难者、血流成河、人民大众的艰难困苦、经济大难、希腊与其他国家的关系日益紧张。
    现实生活要求对明确的问题予以明确的答复。
    希腊问题不仅能够而且必须按照希腊人民的利益，按照和平与国际安全的利益来解决。（据塔斯社莫斯科五月三十日电）
