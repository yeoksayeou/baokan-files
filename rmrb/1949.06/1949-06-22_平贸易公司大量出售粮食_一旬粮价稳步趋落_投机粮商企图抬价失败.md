    [Ping City News] Grain sources have remained smooth this ten-day period. Northeast, Northwest, Pinghan, and Jinpu regions have continuously supplied both fine and coarse grains. At the same time, new wheat has been put on the market, so grain prices continue the trend of the previous ten days, steadily declining. Taking May 31st as the standard, the average grain price for this ten-day period is only 83.26% of that date. Compared with the average price of the previous ten days, flour fell by 6.96%, millet fell by 9.81%, and cornmeal fell by 9.78%. However, there was a slight fluctuation led by fine grains in the three days from the 16th to the 18th of the ten-day period; mainly because the employees of various factories and institutions received their salaries in the middle of the month, and some speculative merchants thought there was an opportunity to take advantage of, and jointly raised grain prices, attempting to exploit the employees and obtain high profits. Therefore, on the 16th, the price of flour rose from 3,500 yuan per bag to 3,800 yuan. In order to protect the interests of employees, the municipal trade company immediately supplied a large amount of food grain to various institutions and factories, and also sold flour in large quantities on the market. On the 15th, when the flour price was stable, the company sold only over 8,300 jin of flour on the market. After the price of goods significantly increased on the 16th, on the 17th, the price of flour was raised by 200 yuan, but the company's listed price remained unchanged at 3,400 yuan, and a large amount of flour was sold, reaching 259,610 jin, and various coarse grains were also sold in large quantities. The next day, the company continued to sell 117,285 jin of flour. Although the merchants who raised prices quoted high prices, they sold very little as a result, and did not earn huge profits. With the strong stabilization efforts of the trade company, the price of flour returned to 3,700 yuan on the 20th.

    平贸易公司大量出售粮食
    一旬粮价稳步趋落
    投机粮商企图抬价失败
    【平市讯】本旬粮食来源仍畅，东北、西北、平汉、津浦细粗粮源源输入，同时新麦业已上市，故粮食价格继续着上旬趋势仍稳稳下落。以五月三十一日为标准，本旬粮食平均价仅为其百分之八三·二六。本旬与上旬平均价比较，面粉下落百分之六·九六，小米落百分之九·八一，玉米面落九·七八。惟旬中十六日至十八日三天中以细粮带头稍有一小波动；主要因各工厂机关职工人员月中发薪，部分投机商人以为有机可乘，联合哄抬粮价，企图剥削职工获得高利，故十六日面粉上涨，由每袋三千五百元升到三千八百元。本市贸易公司为保障职工利益，即以大量食粮供给各机关工厂，同时在市场大量出售面粉。十五日在粉价稳定时公司在市场上售出面粉仅八千三百余斤，十六日物价显升后，十七日面粉价上抬二百元，公司牌价仍为三千四百元不变，大量抛售面粉达二五九、六一○斤之多，同时大量出售各种粗粮。次日继续抛售面粉一一七、二八五斤，抬价商人虽高抬价格，但结果卖出很少，并未盈得厚利。在贸易公司大力稳定下，二十日面粉就又回到三千七百元了。
