Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 24th – In order to restore Shanghai's foreign trade, the Trade and Shipping Departments of the Shanghai Military Control Commission's Financial and Economic Takeover Committee recently announced the "Provisional Measures for the Management of Foreign Vessels Entering and Leaving."

The measures stipulate that all foreign vessels entering or leaving the port, whether importing or exporting, must be approved by the Trade Department of the Shanghai Military Control Commission's Financial and Economic Takeover Committee each time. Foreign vessels flying foreign flags, after entering the port, may be specially permitted by the Trade Department, if it deems it practically necessary, to load and transport passengers and goods to another Chinese port. Any foreign vessel permitted to import by the Trade Department or directly by a higher authority shall, before arriving at the port, have its agent prepare a Chinese petition along with the approval documents, and request the Shipping Administration Bureau of the Shipping Department to verify them before notifying the agent to complete the entry procedures. All foreign vessels permitted to import by the Trade Department and the Shipping Department of the Shanghai Military Control Commission's Financial and Economic Takeover Committee shall fill out a vessel entry permit, an application form, and a request for a pilot, and submit them along with the approval documents to the Shipping Administration Bureau of the Shipping Department for verification. An entry permit will then be issued, and a pilot will be assigned before entry is permitted.

Within twenty-four hours of a foreign vessel's arrival at the port, or within forty-eight hours of berthing outside Wusongkou (excluding Sundays and holidays), the captain or agent shall submit the navigation schedule, import manifest, crew list, and various ship documents to the Shipping Administration Bureau for inspection. Before a foreign vessel exports, the agent shall fill out an export permit, an application form, and a request for a pilot, and submit them along with the crew list, passenger list, export manifest, tax clearance list, and cargo export permits to the Shipping Administration Bureau of the Shipping Department for verification. An export permit will then be issued, and a pilot will be assigned before export is permitted. If a foreign vessel employs tugboats and barges when entering or leaving the port, it shall fill out an application for tugboats and barges and submit it to the Shipping Administration Bureau of the Shipping Department for approval, which will designate tugboats and barges for towing. The agents of existing foreign lighters in the port shall submit the crew list, crew qualification certificates, and ship documents to the Shipping Administration Bureau of the Shipping Department for verification. They will only be temporarily permitted to transport personnel of their own company and factory between the two banks of the Huangpu River. They are not allowed to carry passengers or goods, and may not engage in passenger or freight transport for companies other than their own or for profit. All crew members of vessels owned by foreign companies in the port for transporting their company's personnel must be approved by the Shipping Administration Bureau of the Shipping Department before they can practice. After arriving at the port, foreign vessels may not use ship radios to send messages. Berthing and shifting locations must be submitted to the Shipping Administration Bureau of the Shipping Department for approval in advance and may not be moved arbitrarily. All foreign vessels approved for import and export shall have their cargo inspected and taxes declared by the Customs, passengers inspected by the military and police authorities, epidemic prevention by the port health and quarantine station, and vessels and crew inspected by the Shipping Administration Bureau. The exact time of each entry and exit of foreign vessels shall be notified by the Shipping Administration Bureau of the Shipping Department to the relevant authorities, and the agent shall contact the relevant authorities directly at any time.
