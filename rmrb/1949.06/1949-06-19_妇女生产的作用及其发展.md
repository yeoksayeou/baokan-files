　　The Role and Development of Women's Production
　　Tian Huonong, Lin Ning
　　The key to completing this year's weeding requirements lies in organizing labor mutual aid and mobilizing women to participate in production. Here, we will discuss the role of women's production and its development.
　　Women's participation in agricultural production is significant, and this role is increasing. According to surveys of several typical villages, in terms of labor intensity: The labor efficiency of a full-time female laborer doing heavy work can account for at least one-quarter of that of a full-time male laborer, generally reaching one-third, and for stronger women, it can reach one-half to two-thirds. For light labor such as harvesting and sowing, it can be equal to that of a full-time male laborer. In terms of labor days, the minimum participation in agricultural production throughout the year is 25 days, generally 30 to 50 days, and the maximum is 120 days. Assuming a male laborer participates in agricultural work for 180 days a year, this is equivalent to 14% to 27% of a male labor day, with the maximum reaching 66%. Regarding the proportion of their production achievements in the family income: According to a survey of four typical villages in Tang County: In Zhao Beiluo Village, Zhao Lole's family of five, where the production income of two women accounted for 30% in agriculture, 50% in sideline occupations, and 36.75% of the total income (22 shi, 8 dou, and 3 sheng). In Gezhuang, Zhao Dengke's family of seven, with one full-time male laborer, one donkey, two full-time female laborers, one half-time female laborer, and a three-year-old child, the women's production income accounted for 40.6% of the total income (14 shi and 5 dou 5 sheng). Li Shuangquan in Nandian has a family of four, with one full-time male and one full-time female laborer, and one half-time male and one half-time female laborer, the women's production income accounted for 45% of the total income (16 shi). In Gao Laogong's family in Beiye Yang, relying on the production of one full-time female laborer, the annual income was 23 shi and 9 dou 4 sheng, and the female laborer's income accounted for 80%. The great role played by women's participation in production has broken many backward ideas that look down upon women's production.
　　Let's take a look at the development of women's participation in agricultural production: According to a survey of 37 villages in 20 counties, it was two and a half times that of 1937. Among them, Nangong and Renqiu had the highest increase, accounting for six times, and Xin County had the lowest, accounting for 41.85%, and Huanghua accounting for 63%. Looking at the number of people participating in various types of labor: 1948 increased compared to 1937 as follows: plowing and harrowing increased five times, sowing increased two and a half times, weeding increased 1.7 times, and harvesting increased 1.3 times. Of course, due to different regions, the number of women participating in agricultural production also varies greatly, but from the perspective of historical development, the movement of women participating in agricultural production is in full swing. After women have been allocated land, women have realized that labor is the most glorious, especially in areas where sideline occupations are not developed, women's labor needs to be shifted to agricultural production, which are all favorable conditions for mobilizing women to participate in agricultural production.
　　The main experiences in mobilizing women to participate in agricultural production are: First, we must break the ideological obstacles of women's "shyness" and men's contempt, and lead with active elements. Secondly, patiently help them learn technology and cultivate labor habits. Thirdly, organize them to learn from each other and promote each other; and finally, start with light and easy agricultural tasks and gradually move to heavier labor.
　　This year, we are required to mobilize 50% of women to participate in agricultural production, which is a very arduous task. We must accept past experiences, patiently mobilize and organize. Some places where women's participation in production has reached more than 50% last year cannot be satisfied with this and should improve further; in areas far from the requirements, it is necessary to strive to meet the requirements, but forced orders cannot be used to make up the numbers. Both of these deviations must be prevented. Now is the time for weeding, which is the time to mobilize women to participate in production. We must start with weeding and mobilize a large number of women to participate in production, and then turn to various tasks such as mowing, making fertilizer, harvesting autumn crops, and planting wheat.

　　妇女生产的作用及其发展
    田活农　林宁
    完成今年锄苗要求的关键，在于组织劳力互助及发动妇女参加生产。这里谈谈妇女生产的作用及其发展情况。
    妇女参加农业生产的作用是很大的，而且这个作用正在提高着。据几个典型村调查，从劳动强度上说：一个女全劳力以重活的劳动效率比较最少可占男全劳力的四分之一，一般可达三分之一，较强的可达二分之一至三分之二，如以收割、播种等轻便劳作，则可与男全劳力相等。从劳动日数看，全年参加农业生产最少的二十五天，一般三十天到五十天，最多者达一百二十天。男劳力全年参加农业劳作以一百八十天计，则相当于男劳动日的百分之十四到百分之二十七，最多者达百分之六十六。从她们生产的成绩占家庭收入的比重看：据唐县四个典型村调查：赵北罗村，赵洛乐全家五口人，其中两个妇女的生产收入在农业上占百分之三十，在副业上占百分之五十，在总收入（二十二石八斗三升）中占百分之三十六点七五。葛庄赵登科全家七口人，一男全劳力，一头驴，两个全劳力妇女，一个半劳力妇女，还带有一个三岁的小孩，妇女生产收入占总收入（十四石五斗五升）的百分之四十点六。南店的李双全，全家四口人，全劳力男女各一，半劳力男女各一，妇女生产收入占总收入（十六石）的百分之四十五。北野羊的高老贡家，靠一个女全劳力生产，全年收入二十三石九斗四升，女劳力收入即占百分之八十。妇女参加生产所起的巨大作用，打破了许多瞧不起妇女生产的落后观念。
    我们再看看妇女参加农业生产的发展：据二十个县三十七个村的调查，一九四八年占一九三七年的两倍半，其中最多的是南宫、任邱占六倍，最少的是忻县占百分之四十一点八五，黄骅占百分之六十三。再从参加各种劳作的人数看：一九四八年较一九三七年增加如下：耕耙增五倍，播种增二倍半，锄耪一点七倍，收割一点三倍。当然由于地区的不同，妇女参加农业生产的人数也悬殊很大，但从历史发展的情况看，妇女参加农业生产的运动正在方兴未艾，在妇女分得土地后，妇女们都认识了劳动最光荣，特别在副业不发达的地区，妇女劳力亟须转向农业生产，这都是动员妇女参加农业生产的有利条件。
    动员妇女参加农业生产的主要经验是：首先要打破妇女“脸红”及男人瞧不起的思想障碍，以积极分子带头领导。其次，耐心的帮助学习技术，培养劳动习惯。再次是组织起来，互相学习，互相推动；最后是从轻便易做的农事作起，逐渐转到较重的劳作。
    今年要求动员百分之五十的妇女参加农业生产，这是一件相当艰巨的工作，我们要接受以往的经验，耐心的动员组织，有的地方去年妇女参加生产虽已达百分之五十以上，也不能以此满足，应更加提高；距要求较远地区，努力做到要求是必要的，但不能因凑数而强迫命令。这两个偏向都必须防止。现在正值锄苗，正是动员妇女参加生产的时机，我们要从锄苗开始，发动大量妇女参加生产，以后转入割草、造肥、收秋、种麦等各种劳作上去。
