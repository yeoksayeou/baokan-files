　　"The Bridge" Paved the Way for Us
　　Gu Jin
    The Northeast Film Studio of the People's Republic has released its first artistic masterpiece themed on workers supporting the front and production struggles – "The Bridge" – which is being screened in the new People's city – Beiping – what a delightful event this is! Along with the liberation of the Chinese working people, the film industry of the New Democratic New China has also undergone a new improvement. "The Bridge" is free of yellow narcotics, eliminates decadent sounds, and replaces them with glorious labor, joyful and magnificent songs, and the masters of the new society creating a new world. Therefore, the most significant practical meaning of screening "The Bridge" is undoubtedly a head-on blow to imperialist culture and feudal culture, especially to those trumpeters who prostrate themselves before the "Hollywood" gate, the cultural lackeys. And with new people's films, it begins to seize the old film arena representing imperialist and feudal culture.
    In "The Bridge," we see new themes and new subjects. That is, the working class, in supporting the front line, takes the stance of the master, collectively comes up with ideas under the leadership of the factory director, digs out scrap steel to solve the shortage of steel, and replaces dolomite with refractory bricks to repair the steel melting furnace; After everyone's selfless rush repair, the bridge was finally erected before the thaw. In "The Bridge," we also see new images and new characters. This is the steelmaking team leader, Old Liang, who once didn't sleep for three days and three nights when work was tense, and fainted from overwork; This is the old hero "Old Hou Tou" who has experienced the vicissitudes of life, hates the enemy puppets, and has a deep impression of the "Red Party" in his heart; This is the factory director who believes in the wisdom and ability of the workers, follows the mass line, and relies on the workers to organize production. … This group of new people in the new society, of course, have their own new understanding that is completely different from the past. They understand: "In the past, when the Japanese were here, we worked for others; now we work for ourselves, of course, it can't be the same as before!" (paraphrased), In the story of "The Bridge," these people more vividly express their new wishes, new will, and new feelings. They demand that the revolution be carried through to the end, thoroughly eliminate imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism, and are determined to realize a new democratic society in the whole of China and seek the final and complete liberation of the working class. Therefore, they are able to overcome difficulties by all means and bravely and resolutely build the "Bridge" without fear of difficulties and dangers. As long as we can appreciate the great revolutionary feelings of the working class, it is not difficult to understand why they shouted out their excited and joyful voices: "To support the front line, for victory, all the workers are mobilized!"
    The bridge was built, the first train came over, and the workers gathered to participate in the ribbon-cutting ceremony, and our protagonist was inspired to shout: "Long live Chairman Mao!" Yes, today's working class has miraculously completed undertakings that were impossible in the old society, they have a labor attitude that they have never had before, full of labor enthusiasm, and overcome difficulties that were impossible to overcome before. Aren't all these the results of the wise leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao! In fact, the reality reflected in "The Bridge" is only an example of some moving stories and a typical example of thousands of heroes and models in the entire people's liberation struggle; In other words, it is a moving shot of the new China on the road to advancement. Recently, the "Growth of Huafeng Iron Factory" reported by reporters from the People's Daily and the new success of "The Mine and Metallurgy Research Institute's successful trial of refractory porcelain, the first batch of products have been out of the kiln, and its performance is higher than any imported product" disclosed by the Beiping Liberation Daily can be said to be similar examples. It can be seen from this that the theme of "The Bridge" has a high degree of generalization. In a sense, "The Bridge" also records the birth of a new democratic new industry, and "The Bridge" has also opened up new roads for us.
    Others, in terms of creation and filming, there are still shortcomings that need to be improved urgently, such as the lack of detailed performances in many places, the lack of in-depth characterization of certain characters, the unclear transformation process of engineers, unclear pronunciation, and several sections of photography are blurred. … Even so, since the "bridge" has been erected and the road has been opened, the film industry of the New China will be improved and raised day by day, which is completely expected.

### “桥”为我们开了路

　　“桥”为我们开了路
    古今
    人民的东北电影制片厂，拿出了它的第一部以工人支前、生产斗争为主题的艺术巨片——“桥”，在新的人民城市——北平——上演，这是一件多么令人欣喜的事！随着中国劳动人民的解放，新民主主义新中国的电影事业，也来了一个新的改进　。“桥”没有黄色麻醉剂，根绝了靡靡之音，代替的是光辉的劳动，是愉快而又雄壮的歌声，是新社会的主人创造新世界。因此，上演“桥”的最重大的实际意义，无异就是给帝国主义文化与封建文化，特别是给那些拜倒在“好莱坞”门前的文化奴才之类的吹鼓手们，给了一个当头棒。并且以新的人民的影片，开始夺取代表帝国主义和封建文化的旧影坛阵地。
    在“桥”里，我们看到了新的主题，新的题材。这就是工人阶级在支援前线中，以主人翁的姿态，在厂长领导下集体出主意，挖出废钢来解决缺钢的困难，以耐火砖代替白云石修复了熔钢炉；经过大家奋不顾身的抢修，桥终于在解冻前架起来了。在“桥”里，我们也看到了新的形象，新的人物。这就是当工作紧张的时候，曾经三天三夜不睡觉，疲劳过度而晕过去的化钢组长老梁；这就是饱经风霜，恨透了敌伪，心里对“红党”早留下了深刻印象的老英雄“老侯头”；这就是相信工人的智慧与能力，走群众路线，依靠工人群众组织生产的厂长。……这一群新社会底新人物，当然也有他们自己的与过去完全不同的新认识，他们了解：“过去日本在的时候，我们是为人家作活；现在是为自家个作工，当然不能和过去一样！”（大意），在“桥”的故事中，这些人更鲜明的表现了自己的新愿望、新意志和新感情。他们要求将革命进行到底，彻底消灭帝国主义、封建主义与官僚资本主义，决心要在全中国实现新民主主义社会，求得工人阶级最后的彻底解放。所以他们能够不畏艰险，想尽一切方法克服困难，勇敢坚决的来架“桥”。我们只要能体会工人阶级这种伟大的革命心情，就不难理解他们为什么要喊出兴奋愉快的心声：“为了支援前线，为了胜利，全体工人动员起来啊！”
    桥架成了，第一列火车开过来，工人们齐集参加剪采典礼，我们的主人公又感奋得高喊：“毛主席万岁！”不错，今天的工人阶级，是奇迹似的完成了在旧社会不可能完成的事业，他们有了过去从来不曾有过的劳动态度，充满了劳动热情，克服了从前不可能克服的困难。所有这些，不都是共产党和毛主席英明领导的成果么！其实，“桥”所反映的现实，在整个人民解放斗争中，只不过是若干可歌可泣故事的一个事例，千万英雄模范的一个典型；换句话说，即是前进道路上新中国的一个动人镜头。最近，人民日报记者报导的“华丰铁工厂的成长”，与北平解放报披露的“矿冶研究所耐火磁器试验成功，首批产品已出窑，在性能上较任何舶来品都高”的新的成功，都可以说是类似性质的范例。由此可见，“桥”底主题是有高度的概括性的。在某种意义上说，“桥”又记载了新民主主义新工业的诞生，“桥”还为我们开辟了新的道路。
    其他，在创作与拍制上，还有急待改进的缺点，如很多地方表演不细致，某些人物性格刻划不深刻，工程师转变过程不够明显，发音不清晰，摄影颇有几段模糊不清。……虽然如此，既经架起了“桥”，打通了路，新中国的影坛，自会日新月异的改进与提高，那完全是意料中事。
