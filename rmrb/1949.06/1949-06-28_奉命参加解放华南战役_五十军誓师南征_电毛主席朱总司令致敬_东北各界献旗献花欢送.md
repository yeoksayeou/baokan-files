Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 27th. The 50th Army of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, reorganized from the former Kuomintang 60th Army which revolted in Changchun last October, recently received orders from Commander Lin Biao, Luo Ronghuan and other leaders of the Fourth Field Army to enter the pass immediately, head to Jiangnan, and participate in the great campaign to liberate South China. The army held a southward expedition rally at its garrison on the 8th of this month. Since the formal political training began in early February this year, under the direct leadership of the Northeast Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and the Northeast Military Region, and after three movements including democracy, complaining of suffering, and class consciousness, and three educations including war concepts, unity, and policies, the class consciousness of all commanders and fighters has gradually improved, and the companies are full of the spirit of killing enemies, seeking revenge, and making meritorious service. After the entire army received the order to vow to march south, all were jubilant and encouraged. The oath-taking meeting was extremely grand. General Zhou Baozhong, Deputy Commander of the Northeast Military Region, attended in person. The Jilin Provincial Committee of the CPC, the Provincial Government, the Changchun Municipal Committee of the CPC, the Municipal Government, and representatives from various organs and mass organizations also attended the meeting. In addition, more than 10,000 local residents participated. Before the meeting, a military parade was held. When General Zhou Baozhong appeared with the leaders of the army in front of the neat ranks, the entire audience enthusiastically shouted slogans such as "Long live Chairman Mao!" "Long live Commander-in-Chief Zhu!" "Best wishes for the health of the leaders of the Fourth Field Army!"

After Wang Zhenqian, Director of the Political Department of the army, delivered the opening speech, Zhou Baozhong, Deputy Commander of the Military Region, spoke. He encouraged everyone to strengthen unity, overcome all difficulties in action, and complete the task. He urged them to respond to the call of Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu, abide by the Three Main Rules of Discipline and the Eight Points for Attention, and always maintain the glorious title of the People's Liberation Army. Subsequently, the military and political leaders of the army spoke. Xu Wenlie, Political Commissar of the army, pointed out in his speech that the meeting was a sign that the 50th Army was moving towards revolution in action. In the future, it is necessary to resolutely eliminate the enemy in order to live up to the education and help of the Communist Party and the people. Ye Changgeng, Deputy Commander of the army, encouraged everyone to be long-term workers for the people, do more good things for the people, and repay the hopes of the people. Representatives from factories, organs, schools, groups, and families of soldiers in Jilin, Changchun, and other places unanimously stated that they would work hard in the rear to support the front line, and encouraged everyone not to worry about their families and use all their strength to annihilate the enemy. Representatives of the troops unanimously stated that they would resolutely carry out orders, annihilate the enemy in large numbers, seek revenge and make meritorious service.

After the oath was taken under the leadership of Xu, the political commissar of the army, representatives of local organs presented flags and flowers. The meeting also sent a telegram to Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu to express their respect.

In addition, General Zeng Zesheng, Commander of the 50th Army, was unable to attend the oath-taking meeting due to treatment for arthritis. He specially summoned military and political cadres above the company level of the entire army on May 19th and 20th for a speech. Commander Zeng pointed out that since the army's uprising, it had been reorganized according to the order of the headquarters of the People's Liberation Army and accepted the leadership of the Communist Party of China. Thanks to the army's active political rectification, the relationship between officers and soldiers and the relationship between the army and the people has been initially improved. Commander Zeng called on all commanders and fighters to resolutely carry out the orders of the leaders of the Fourth Field Army after going south, cooperate with other fraternal troops in combat, thoroughly eliminate the remaining Kuomintang reactionary forces, and make contributions to the people.

Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 27th. The telegram from the oath-taking meeting of the 50th Army of the People's Liberation Army to Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu reads as follows: Chairman Mao, Commander-in-Chief Zhu:

Under the leadership of the Party, our army has undergone several months of political rectification, and the entire army has taken on a new look. Class consciousness has been generally improved, and combat will has become increasingly firm. Since the People's Liberation Army crossed the river to fight, it has been invincible, occupying Nanjing, the old nest of the Chiang bandits, and liberating Shanghai and Wuhan, declaring the demise of the Kuomintang reactionary rule in politics and economy. Victories have been frequently reported, and the entire army is jubilant and eager to fight. Now, upon receiving the order from the leaders of the Fourth Field Army, Lin and Luo, we will enter the pass and head to Jiangnan to join the battle sequence. When the entire army received the order, all were jubilant and excited, and a vow to march south was held on the 8th of this month. We will resolutely obey the orders of our superiors, follow the victorious advance of other fraternal troops, bravely kill the enemy, make meritorious service to atone for our crimes, abide by the discipline of the masses, implement the Eight-Point Covenant, and ensure that we do not violate the slightest thing, and in the great revolutionary war to liberate the whole country, we will repay the people's love and cultivation. We will certainly fight to the end under your leadership to finally eliminate the remaining Kuomintang reactionary forces and liberate all of China.

The entire commanders and fighters of the 50th Army kowtow in unison.
