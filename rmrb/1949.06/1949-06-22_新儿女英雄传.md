    Chapter Eleven: Taking the Guard Tower (Continued 1)
    Four
    In the evening, the comrades gathered. The sky was very gloomy, and you couldn't see anyone across from you. A group of people, carrying ladders, iron files, and small saws called "soft removers"...felt their way to the reed field west of Doyang Village.

    Little Mei, carrying a small oil bottle, said, "You wait here, I'll go." Shuangxi said, "Can you do it alone? Should I go with you?" Little Mei said, "I can handle it alone, too many people might get noticed."

    Little Mei slipped into the village alone and reached the north gate of the Zhu family mansion; the gate was not yet bolted. She gently pushed the door open and hid in the kitchen on the right. After waiting for a while, a woman came out, bolted the main gate, and bolted the second gate after entering it. Little Mei waited until the dead of night, quietly walked out, carefully smeared oil on the upper and lower seams of the main gate with duck feathers, opened the door without a sound, and also opened the small gate of the courtyard. She came out and gently closed the main gate, hurrying back to the reed field, saying, "The gate is open, hurry up."

    The group followed Little Mei. It was very dark. They followed one another, turning and twisting, and came to the Zhu family mansion, entering the courtyard. The weeds in the yard were half a person tall, and everyone tiptoed past, sticking to the base of the wall. Reaching the east window below the rear wall of the two-story building, they put up a ladder and used iron files and "soft removers," smeared with garlic – so there would be no sound – and quietly removed the window bars, gently pulling out the bricks inside, passing them down one by one.

    The window was opened. Shuangxi went in first, listening in the corridor; the puppet soldiers in the room were all snoring. He tiptoed down the stairs, the east wing where Zhang Jinlong lived in the courtyard was dark; he flashed to the second courtyard and saw lights on the middle two floors of the large guard tower, there was no sound, he could hear the sentry on the top floor playing the whistle; going further forward, in the first courtyard, there was no movement on the corner towers, and the puppet soldiers in the north house were all sound asleep...

    After Shuangxi investigated the situation, the first group of five, led by Zhao Wugeng, went in and hid in the front yard; the second group of five, led by Hei Laocai and Liu Shuangxi, hid under the large guard tower; the third group of five, led by Niu Dashui and Gao Tuer, guarded the door of the east wing where Zhang Jinlong lived; the fourth group of five, led by Niu Xiaoshui, stayed in the two-story building. Everyone prepared, quietly waiting for Hei Laocai to reach the top of the large guard tower, take care of the sentry, and then start all at once.

    Hei Laocai took four people and quietly touched the second floor of the guard tower; they saw several lights on the table, and the puppet soldiers were all sleeping like dead pigs. He left three people behind, and he and Shuangxi went up to the third floor; in the lamplight, the gun holster was hanging on the wall, Li Liuzi was bareheaded, pillowing his box cannon, chin up, mouth open, snoring. Leaving Shuangxi again, Hei Laocai walked straight up, alone with a box cannon. The sentry on top heard the stairs creaking and asked, "Who is it?" Hei Laocai calmed down and whispered, "It's me." He took a big step up. The sentry asked, "Who are you?" Hei Laocai smiled and said, "Ha, it's me, who else could it be?" The sentry said, "Are you here to relieve me?" Hei Laocai had already gone up the stairs, and at a glance, he saw the glow of a cigarette in the darkness, the puppet soldier was smoking, huddling his hands for fear of the cold, holding a large gun in his arms. Hei Laocai rushed up, grabbed his gun barrel with one hand, and held a box cannon against him with the other, shouting, "Don't move! Stay put, this isn't your business!" Then they heard shouts everywhere: "Don't move!" "Don't move!" Actions began everywhere.

    The sentry was so frightened that he didn't dare to make a sound, and obediently handed over his gun and bullets. Hei Laocai escorted him down. Shuangxi had already pulled Li Liuzi's box cannon from under his neck and was poking him with the gun, saying, "Wake up! Wake up!"

    Li Liuzi didn't even open his eyes, smacked his lips, and said, "Stop it! We made noise all night, what else is there to make noise about!" Shuangxi twisted his ear and pulled him up. Li Liuzi had a trail of sticky saliva hanging from the corner of his mouth, rolled his eyes, and saw Shuangxi and Hei Laocai pointing guns at him. He seemed to be dreaming and became even more confused. Hei Laocai shouted, "Put on your clothes and go!" Li Liuzi was finally frightened awake. The two of them escorted them down.

    On the second floor, three comrades were carrying several large guns on their backs, guarding the prisoners. The puppet soldiers, shabbily dressed, huddled together. Some who recognized Hei Laocai and Liu Shuangxi hurriedly nodded and bowed, saying, "Captain, District Chief, you're here! We've been waiting for you." Hei Laocai smiled and said, "Good! Pack up your things, put your bags and quilts on your backs, let's go together!"

    Hei Laocai was busy going downstairs when he ran into Niu Dashui and Gao Tuer rushing up to ask, "Is Zhang Jinlong here?" Hei Laocai was taken aback, but calmly asked, "What? Isn't he in the room?" Dashui said, "There's only a small orderly in the room. We searched from the back yard to the front yard. Both groups succeeded, and the sentry on the corner tower was also called down, but we just can't find Zhang Jinlong!"

    Gao Tuer, seeing that Zhang Jinlong was not in the large guard tower either, was so anxious that he stamped his feet, saying, "What can we do? Damn it, that orderly also said he didn't know!" Shuangxi brought Li Liuzi over and said to him in a very friendly and low voice, "Liuzi, you must know where Zhang Jinlong has gone!" Li Liuzi scratched his head, looked at them timidly, and said, "Oh, I can't say for sure!" Gao Tuer was so angry that he grabbed his collar, scolding, "You bastard! Still want to be a traitor? If you don't tell me, I'll beat you!" Li Liuzi hurriedly said, "Don't beat me! Don't beat me! I'll tell you!" Gao Tuer let go. Li Liuzi whispered, "He must have gone to play with women, but I don't know which house he's in. Just ask his orderly, Wang Quan'er, he'll know. Wang Quan'er takes him there and back, how could he not know where he is?"

    At this moment, Zhao Wugeng and Niu Xiaoshui ran up, asking, "Did you find him?" Hei Laocai told everyone not to worry and first concentrate all the prisoners and captured goods in the back yard, without making any noise; he and Dashui and Gao Tuer, taking Li Liuzi, went to ask Wang Quan'er.

    Wang Quan'er, with his head lowered and tears streaming down his face, still said he didn't know. Hei Laocai saw the child's expression and knew he was scared. He put a large hand on the child's shoulder and sat next to him, asking, "Little brother, where are you from?" Wang Quan'er didn't raise his head, pouting, and said, "I'm from Wang Village. I came to be a porter for my dad, but he kept me and won't let me leave!" Laocai said, "Is that so! Ugh, look at this traitor Zhang Jinlong, he's just like the devils, bullying us Chinese! Tell me quickly, where is this guy, we'll catch him, save you, and get rid of a scourge for the people, wouldn't that be great?"

    Wang Quan'er turned his face and glanced at Laocai, then said in a choked voice, "I...I dare not say, he...he knows, I'll be dead!" Laocai said, "We're going to catch him right away! You follow us from now on, we'll protect you, don't be afraid." Wang Quan'er relaxed, wiped away his tears, and said, "Okay, I'll lead you there!"

    Laocai and the others walked into the yard, where the people had already gathered. He settled things down and took part of the people to catch Zhang Jinlong.

    Five

    Yang Xiaomei was waiting anxiously under the window of the two-story building. Hei Laocai and the others came down the ladder. Xiaomei asked how things were going, if Zhang Jinlong had been caught. Hei Laocai said, "The tower is taken, Zhang Jinlong isn't here, we're going to catch him. Shuangxi is in charge here, you go over to them." After speaking, a group of people followed Wang Quan'er.

    They went out of the north gate of the Zhu family mansion, turned a few corners, and came to the door of a small widow named Chen. Laocai first sent Zhao Wugeng and Niu Xiaoshui to guard the front door, then sent Niu Dashui and Gao Tuer to guard the back wall, and Hei Laocai personally took Wang Quan'er and a few others to the roof.

    Zhang Jinlong wasn't asleep at this moment, he was joking with the small widow; hearing what sounded like footsteps on the roof, he listened carefully and knew something was wrong. Anxiously, he whispered to the small widow, "Bad news! Someone's coming to catch us! Put on your clothes quickly, I'll protect you!" The small widow was frightened. The two hurriedly put on their clothes, Zhang Jinlong took the box cannon, and pulled her to leave.

    The opposite roof was already covered, Hei Laocai and the others were preparing to come down. Zhang Jinlong gently pulled out the door bolt, suddenly opened the door, fired a shot at the opposite roof, and pushed the small widow out the door. The people on the roof heard the door open, and saw a figure running out of the house, assuming it was Zhang Jinlong, and fired a volley of shots, killing the small widow in the yard.

    As soon as the gunfire stopped, Zhang Jinlong darted across the yard, opened the main gate and tried to run. Zhao Wugeng was about to open fire outside the door, but Niu Xiaoshui pounced on him, wanting to capture him alive. Zhao Wugeng didn't dare to fire, and rushed up to grab him. Zhang Jinlong knew Kung Fu, dodged and threw Xiaoshui to the ground and ran. Zhao Wugeng chased closely behind. Zhang Jinlong went into a small alley, and Zhao Wugeng chased into the small alley as well. Zhao Wugeng fired a shot, the bullet whizzed past Zhang Jinlong's scalp. Zhang Jinlong fired a shot in return, but missed, and turned corners, desperately running out of the village. Zhao Wugeng chased relentlessly, sticking close.

    Reaching outside the village, Zhang Jinlong ran on the ice. Zhao Wugeng also chased on the ice. He chased and shouted, "Zhang Jinlong! Stop running! You're also Chinese, surrender and you won't be killed!" Zhang Jinlong ran and shouted, "Zhao Wugeng! Let me go, and you'll benefit in the future!" Zhao Wugeng gritted his teeth in hatred, knelt on one leg, and aimed at the black shadow, Zhang Jinlong was shot in the left shoulder, staggered and almost fell; he stopped, turned around and fired a shot, Zhao Wugeng was about to fire a second shot, but was shot by Zhang Jinlong...

    Hei Laocai and the others didn't know which way they ran. Hearing the gunfire, they were very anxious, and hurriedly followed the sound. After searching for a long time, they found a figure on the ice, holding a large gun, kneeling there; they shouted a few times without response, and ran over to find that it was Zhao Wugeng. Niu Xiaoshui lit the "chemical" toothbrush handle, the pale light illuminated the gaunt Wugeng, one eye closed, one eye open forward, as if still aiming at the enemy. But he was already dead; the blood flowing from his chest formed a large pool on the ice, melting more than an inch of ice, the bright red blood ice, freezing the person. Hei Laocai cried and said, "Wugeng really was a good man!" Niu Xiaoshui couldn't help crying out loud. The comrades all lowered their heads, tears falling on the ice.

    They found blood on the ice ahead, the blood trail going all the way to the direction of Shenjia Village. Everyone gritted their teeth, vowing to avenge Wugeng. At this time, the guard tower was burning. It was Shuangxi and the people of Doyang Village burning the tower. The flames were very large, soaring high, especially bright in the dark night, the ice reflecting a large red patch. Laocai and the others suddenly saw that in the east, a village in the distance also had flames rising; to the south, another village also caught fire, lighting up the sky over there. The comrades knew that Baiyangdian in the east was also burning guard towers.

    第十一回  拿岗楼（续一）
    四
    晚上，同志们集合了。天阴得很沉，对面不见人。一伙人带了梯子，铁锉，和叫做“软收子”的小锯……摸到大杨庄西边苇子地里。
    小梅提着小油瓶儿，说：“你们等着，我去了。”双喜说：“你一个能行吗？还是我跟着你去吧。”小梅说：“我一个就办了，人多了怕给发觉。”
    小梅独个儿闪进村，到了朱家北门；门还没有插上，她轻轻儿推门进去，藏到右手的一间厨房里。等了一阵，里面有个妇道出来，把大门插上了；进了二门，又把二门插上了。小梅等到深更半夜，悄悄走出来，仔细的用鸭毛在大门上下缝儿里抹了油，一点没声音的拉开门；又把跨院的小门也开了，就出来，把大门轻轻带上；急忙回到苇子地里，说：“门开了，快去吧。”
    大伙儿跟着小梅走。天很黑。他们一个跟着一个，转弯抹角，来到朱家大宅，进了挎院。院里的荒草半人高，大家贴着墙根溜过去。到了二层楼后墙东窗户下面，搭了梯子上去，用铁锉和“软收子”，抹了蒜——这样可以没有声音，就悄悄的卸开窗棂，把里面垒的砖，轻轻儿抽出来，一块一块往下传。
    窗户弄开了。双喜先进去，在过道里听听，房里的伪军都睡得呼噜呼噜的。他轻手轻脚摸下楼梯，院里张金龙住的东配房黑着；闪到第二进院，看见大岗楼的中间两层有灯光，没有声音，听得见顶上一层，那哨兵正在吹口哨玩儿；再往前去，第一进院，抱角楼上没有动静，北屋里伪军也都睡得死死的……
    双喜探明了情况回来，头一拨赵五更五个就进去，溜到前院埋伏起来；第二拨黑老蔡刘双喜五个，到大岗楼下隐蔽好；第三拨牛大水高屯儿五个，到张金龙住的东配房门口守住；第四拨牛小水五个，留在二层楼。大家都准备好，静悄悄的，单等黑老蔡到大岗楼顶上，解决了哨兵，一齐动手。
    黑老蔡带了四个人，轻轻摸上第二层岗楼；看见桌子点着几个灯，伪军都睡得跟死猪似的。留下三个人，他和双喜又上了三层楼；灯光里，枪套子挂在墙上，李六子光着脑瓜儿、枕着盒子枪，下巴朝上，张着个嘴，正在打呼呢。又留下双喜，黑老蔡独个儿提着盒子枪直往上走。顶上那哨兵听见楼梯响，问：“谁？”黑老蔡沉住气，低声说：“是我。”一面跨大步子上去。哨兵问：“你是谁？”黑老蔡笑着说：“哈，是我么，还有谁？”哨兵说：“你换岗来啦？”黑老蔡已经上了楼，一眼瞧见，黑暗里闪亮着烟卷儿的火光，那伪军抽着烟、怕冷的拢着手，一支大枪在怀里抱着。黑老蔡抢上去，一手攒住他的套筒枪，一手用盒子枪顶住他，喝一声：“别动！好好儿待着，没你的事儿！”就听见这儿也喊：“别动！”那儿也喊：“别动！”前前后后都动作开了。
    那哨兵吓得不敢作声，乖乖儿的缴了枪和子弹，黑老蔡押着他下来。双喜已经把李六子的盒子枪，从他脖子底下抽出来，正在用枪拨拉他说：“醒醒！醒醒！”
    李六子眼也不睁，吧咂着嘴儿说：“别闹喽！闹了一宿啦，还闹什么！”双喜扭住他的耳朵，拉他起来。李六子嘴角上挂着一溜黏沫子，翻了个白眼儿，瞧见双喜黑老蔡拿枪对着他，好象是在梦里，越发的糊涂了。黑老蔡喝了一声：“快穿上衣裳走！”李六子才吓醒过来。两个人押着他们往下走。
    二层楼上，三个同志身上都背了几支大枪，看守着俘虏。伪军们衣冠不整的挤在一块儿，瞧见黑老蔡刘双喜，有些认得的，忙点头哈腰的说：“大队长、区长，你们来啦，正盼着你们咧。”黑老蔡笑着说：“好么！你们把东西拾掇拾掇，把包袱被子背上，咱们一块儿走！”
    黑老蔡忙着要下楼，正碰见牛大水高屯儿急急忙忙的跑上来问：“这儿有张金龙没有？”黑老蔡吃了一惊，可镇静的问：“怎么？他不在屋里？”大水说：“屋里光有一个小护兵，我们从后院找到前院，那两拨子都得了手，抱角楼上的哨兵也叫下来了，可就是找不到张金龙！”
    高屯儿见大岗楼上也没有张金龙，急得跳脚，说：“这可怎么着？他妈的，护兵那小子也说不知道！”双喜把李六子带到这边来，很和气的低声对他说：“六子，你一定知道，张金龙到底上哪儿去了？”李六手搔搔脑瓜儿，胆小的望着他们，说：“啊呀，这我可说不清！”气得高屯儿一把抓住他的领子，骂着：“你这王八蛋！还想当汉奸吗？不说出来我揍你！”李六子忙说：“别揍别揍！我说给你！”高屯儿放了手。李六子小声说：“他准是玩娘们去了，我就是不知道他在哪一家。你们只要问他的护兵王圈儿，就问出来了。王圈儿送他接他，还能不知道他在哪儿吗？”
    这时候，赵五更牛小水都跑上来了，问：“找到没有？”黑老蔡叫大家别着急，先把前前后后的俘虏和缴获的东西，一齐集中到后院，不许声张；自己就和大水高屯儿，带着李六子，去问王圈儿。
    王圈儿可低着头，挂着两行眼泪，还是说不知道。黑老蔡看这孩子的神气，知道是害怕着呢。他一只大手搭在孩子的肩上，自己坐在他旁边，问：“小兄弟，你是哪儿来的孩子呀？”王圈儿头也不抬，噘着嘴说：“我是王庄的。我替我爹来当夫，他扣住，就不叫我走啦！”老蔡说：“是这么个事啊！吓，看张金龙这汉奸王八蛋，尽跟鬼子一个心，欺负咱中国人！你快告诉我，这家伙在哪儿，咱们抓着他，救了你，还给百姓除一个害，你看好不好？”
    王圈儿侧转脸，望了老蔡一下，又哽哽噎噎的说：“我……我不敢说，他……他知道了，我就没命啦！”老蔡说：“我们马上就去抓他！以后你跟着我们，有我们护着你，不用害怕。”王圈儿松心了，擦干眼泪，说：“行，我领你们去！”
    老蔡他们走到院里，人已经集合好了，他安顿了一下，就带着一部分人，赶忙去抓张金龙。
    五
    杨小梅在二层楼的窗户下面，等得很心焦。黑老蔡几个从梯上下来了。小梅问情形怎么样，张金龙抓住没有。黑老蔡说：“楼拿下来了，张金龙不在，我们抓他去。这边由双喜负责，你到他们那儿去吧。”说完，一伙人跟着王圈儿走了。
    他们出了朱家北门，转了几个弯，来到一个姓陈的小寡妇家门外。老蔡先派赵五更牛小水把住前门，又派牛大水高屯儿守住后墙，黑老蔡亲自带着王圈儿几个人上房。
    张金龙这会儿没睡着，正和小寡妇耍笑呢；听着房上仿佛有脚步声，仔细一听，他就知道不好，心里一急，就对小寡妇低声说：“坏了！有人来抓我们了！快穿上衣裳，我保护着你走！”小寡妇吓昏了。两个人急忙穿了衣裳，张金龙提了盒子枪，拉着她就走。
    对面房上已经压了顶，黑老蔡他们正预备下来。张金龙轻轻儿抽出门闩，猛的开开门，照对面屋顶打了一枪，跟手把小寡妇往门外一推。房上的人听见开门，瞅见屋里有个人影儿跑出来，只当是张金龙，就一个排子枪打下去，那小寡妇打死在院里了。
    枪声一停，张金龙箭似的窜过院子，开了大门就想跑。门外赵五更正要开枪打，可是牛小水扑了上去，想捉活的。赵五更不敢开枪，也抢上去抓他。张金龙会拳，一闪身把小水摔在地上就跑。赵五更跟屁股就追。张金龙钻进小胡同，赵五更也追进小胡同。赵五更一枪打去，枪子儿飕的从张金龙头皮上擦过。张金龙回头一枪，也没打中，就转弯抹角，拼命往村外跑。赵五更死死的追，跟住不放。
    到了村外，张金龙在冰上跑。赵五更也在冰上追。他一面追一面喊：“张金龙！别跑了！你也是个中国人，缴枪就不杀你！”张金龙一面跑一面喊：“赵五更！你放了我，往后有你的好处！”赵五更恨得咬牙，跪下一条腿，瞄准那黑影打去，张金龙左肩膀中了一枪，一个踉跄差点儿摔倒；他站住脚，转身就是一枪，赵五更正要放第二枪，可就给张金龙打中了……
    黑老蔡一伙不知道他们往哪儿跑了，听到枪声，很着急，忙跟着声音找。找了好一会，才发现冰上有个人影，拿着大枪，跪在那儿；喊了几声不动，跑过去一看，正是赵五更。牛小水把“化学”的牙刷把子点着，青白的光照见精瘦的五更，一只眼儿闭着，一只眼儿向前睁着，仿佛还在瞄着敌人。他可是已经死了；胸口淌下来的血，流在冰上一大滩，冰化下去一寸多，鲜红的血冰，连人冻住了。黑老蔡流泪说：“五更真是好样儿的！”牛小水忍不住放声大哭。同志们一个个低下头，泪点儿掉在冰上。
    他们发现前面的冰上也有血，那血迹一路过去，朝申家庄那一面去了。谁都咬牙切齿，发誓要给五更报仇。这时候，岗楼烧着了，是双喜他们和大杨庄的老百姓在烧楼，火头很大，窜的挺高，在黑暗的夜里特别亮，冰上映红一大片。老蔡他们忽然看见：东边，远远的一个村子里，也窜起了火头；靠南，又有一个村子里，也起了火；把那边天都照红了。同志们知道，东部白洋淀，也在烧岗楼呢。
    （未完）（附图片）
    张金龙推出小寡妇，趁机往外冲。
