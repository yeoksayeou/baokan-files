Over 500 representatives from various departments attended, and Commander Chen Yi and Deputy Commander Su Yu of the Third Field Army were present. After elucidating the great significance of the liberation of Shanghai, Commander Chen pointed out that the achievement of this victory was the victory of the Chinese Communist Party's political line, the wise leadership of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, the heroic struggle of the broad masses of the people and all commanders and fighters of the army, and the result of the coordinated operations of fraternal field armies, especially the heroic struggle of the Shanghai working class over the past few decades. Commander Chen then praised the participating troops for overcoming hardships and difficulties, resolutely and bravely fighting, and strictly abiding by policies and disciplines, and called on all commanders and fighters to continue to carry forward the fine traditions of the People's Army, actively participate in the construction of the new Shanghai, and consolidate the great victory with a high degree of discipline. In his speech, Deputy Commander Su Yu pointed out that the victory of the military struggle "is only the first step in a long march of ten thousand miles," and cautioned everyone not to be arrogant and complacent, to learn to fight the enemy in complex situations, to humbly learn various knowledge of urban garrison, and to strengthen army building and ties with the masses. Deputy Commander Su Yu pointed out that the main task of the garrison troops in the future should be to cooperate with people from all walks of life to strengthen garrison work, eliminate remnants of the enemy, establish a people's democratic order, and protect the construction of the new Shanghai. To this end, it is necessary to continue to strengthen policy study. As for our entire army, in addition to undertaking mass work in the future, we should also strengthen military training, improve our political level and strengthen policy study, become familiar with the use of existing weapons, and improve our technology, so as to move towards modernization and build a modernized national defense force in the future. In addition, we must carry out cultural and recreational activities in the army and promote military sports to train ourselves into a strong modern army. Guo Hua Ruo, Political Commissar of the Garrison Command, called on everyone to conduct more investigation and research, understand the new situation in the new Shanghai, stand firm, pay attention to methods, pay attention to attitudes, and put forward ten garrison tasks. Political Commissar Guo criticized the recent incidents of military vehicles causing accidents, and demanded that all departments be highly vigilant and correct them, and formulate concrete and effective measures to prevent such incidents from happening again.
