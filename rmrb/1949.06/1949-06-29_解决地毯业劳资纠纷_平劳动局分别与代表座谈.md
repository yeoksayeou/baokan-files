To resolve the labor disputes in the carpet industry, the Beiping Labor Bureau convened座谈会 separate座谈会 with representatives of carpet industry workers and representatives of employers on the afternoons of the 24th and 28th of this month. Representatives from 45 companies, including Renli and Kaiyuan, attended. At both座谈会, it was pointed out that sales had not yet been smooth and finished products were difficult to sell, indirectly causing constant wage disputes. The dispute at Renli and Zhenchang, among others, centered on whether to implement the "big Sabbath" system and whether to pay wages. Factories like Kaiyuan, on the other hand, had disputes over wage standards calculations: should one foot be calculated as one work unit, or nine hours as one work unit? Should wages be calculated by day or by piece? Related to the wage standard issue was the issue of cost calculation: the employers said they were losing half, while the workers believed they were losing some, but not on workers' wages, but rather due to having more staff than workers, whose wages were also higher than those of the workers, and some factories also had wasteful phenomena. Due to high costs and low quality, exports were also affected. After everyone discussed the issue, Shi Huaibi, Director of the Beiping Labor Bureau, raised several questions for everyone to consider, and then to study and resolve them together with the trade union, the labor side, and the employer side. Director Shi emphasized: although carpet sales are currently stagnant, there will be broad prospects for development soon after opening up foreign trade routes, and he hopes that both labor and management can come up with more ways to overcome difficulties and get through this difficult period. As for how to overcome difficulties, Director Shi proposed three methods: (1) Reduce costs and improve quality to gradually open up sales channels. (2) Implement a progressive piece-rate calculation method and a bonus system to overcome unreasonable phenomena such as egalitarianism and excessively high or low wages. (3) Both parties should draft a labor contract, stipulate factory rules, and abide by them together. Both labor and management should adhere to the principle of developing production. After the meeting adjourned at 7:30, the Carpet Industry Guild immediately appointed representatives to prepare to participate in the upcoming joint meeting. (Dong)

　　解决地毯业劳资纠纷
  　平劳动局分别与代表座谈
    【本报讯】北平市劳动局为解决地毯业劳资间纠纷，特于本月二十四、二十八日下午分别召集地毯业工人代表及资方代表座谈会，到仁立、开源等四十五家代表，在两个座谈会上，均提出因销路还没畅通，成品出脱困难，间接造成工资纠纷不断发生。仁立、振昌等是争执是否实行大礼拜制，是否发工资；开源等厂则是工资标准计算上的纠纷：一方尺算一工，还是九时算一工？按天计工还是按件计工？联系到工资标准问题，则是成本计算的问题：资方说是赔一半，工人认为赔一些，但不是赔在工人工资上，而是由于职员多于工人，工资也比工人过多，有的厂还有浪费现象。由于成本过高，质量低，也就影响了出口。经大家座谈后，由北平市劳动局史怀璧局长提出数问题，请大家参考，再会同工会、劳方资方研究解决。史局长强调指出：目前地毯销路停滞，但不久打通对外贸易路线后，即有广泛的发展前途，希望劳资双方均能多想办法，克服困难，渡过这一难关。至于如何克服困难，史局长提出三个办法：（一）降低成本，提高质量，逐渐打开销路。（二）工资实行按件累进计算法及奖励制，克服工资中的平均主义及过高过低等不合理现象。（三）双方拟定劳动合同，规定厂规，共同遵守。劳资均应服从发展生产这一原则。七时半散会后，地毯业同业公会即推定代表，准备参加行将召开之联席会议。（董）
