Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 9th: The 884 locomotive of the Hailar Locomotive Depot of the Qiqihar Railway Administration has created the highest safe driving record in Northeast China and has been awarded the title of First-Class Model by the Northeast Railway Administration. The locomotive has safely traveled 110,100 kilometers, breaking the record of 106,000 kilometers safely traveled by the "Iron Ox" locomotive of the Suibei Locomotive Depot of the Harbin Railway Administration this spring. It has exceeded the two first-class maintenance periods (meaning a complete disassembly, inspection, and repair of the locomotive every 50,000 kilometers) stipulated by the Northeast Railway Administration without any failures, maintaining the good condition of the locomotive. Compared with the puppet Manchurian period, this is equivalent to three first-class maintenance periods during that time. According to more precise statistics for January, February, and March of this year, the locomotive averaged 495 kilometers per day, exceeding the daily standard (422 kilometers) stipulated by the Northeast Railway Administration by about 15%, and exceeding the daily standard during the puppet Manchurian period (239 kilometers) by more than 111%. Its highest daily speed reached 748.8 kilometers. The maximum technical speed of the locomotive is 53 kilometers per hour, with an average of 39 kilometers, also exceeding the standards stipulated by the Railway Administration and during the puppet Manchurian period. In the three months that the locomotive has been implementing the new driving system, it has frequently arrived at stations ahead of schedule, saving enough time to run an additional 14 and a half trains. The maximum traction tonnage of the locomotive is 1,709 tons, exceeding the standard traction load of 1,440 tons for Type A locomotives by more than 18%, and exceeding the standard during the puppet Manchurian period by about 15%, resulting in five awards during this process. When the 884 locomotive was first put into use, it also had many shortcomings, such as water leaks and clogged smoke pipes. However, since the implementation of the responsibility system for crews and the new driving system, the sense of responsibility and enthusiasm of all members of the crew have greatly increased. In particular, the driver, Communist Party member Zhang Zhongye, provided careful leadership, improved technology, and overcame various difficulties, thus creating glorious driving achievements. The Northeast Railway Administration has now awarded commendations to the crew and the driver Zhang Zhongye.

　　光荣的八八四机车　创造全东北安全行车最高纪录
    【新华社沈阳九日电】齐齐哈尔铁路管理局海拉尔机务段八八四号机车，创造了全东北安全行车的最高纪录，被东北铁路管理总局奖为一等模范。该机车安全行车十一万零一百余公里，打破了今春哈尔滨铁路局绥北机务段铁牛号机车安全行车十万六千余公里的纪录，超过了东北铁路总局规定的两次甲等检修期（即行车五万公里将机车拆卸大检查修理一次），未发生一次故障，保持了机车的良好状况，如与伪满时期比较，则相当于伪满时三次甲检期。根据今年一、二、三月份较精确的统计，该机车平均日行四百九十五公里，超过东北铁路总局规定的日行标准（四百二十二公里）约百分之十五，超过伪满时日行标准（二百三十九公里）百分之一百一十一以上，其最高日行速度则达七百四十八点八公里。该机车技术速度最高每小时为五十三公里，平均为三十九公里，亦超过路局所规定的标准及伪满时的标准。该机车在执行新行车制度的三个月内，因经常提前到站，所节省的时间可多开出十四个半列车。该车最高牵引吨数为一千七百零九吨，较Ａ型机车牵引标准量一千四百四十吨超过百分之十八以上，较伪满时标准约超过百分之十五，因而在这一过程中受到奖励五次。八八四号机车在开始使用时亦有许多缺点，如漏水、烟管堵塞等，但由于实行了乘务负责制及新行车制度以后，该车乘务组全体人员的责任心和积极性都大为提高，特别是司机共产党员张忠业细心领导，改进了技术，克服了各种困难，因而创造了光辉的行车成绩。现东北铁路总局已对该乘务组及司机张忠业予以奖励。
