　　Wheat head smut was first discovered in the Dingxian area in 1933. At that time, it mostly occurred in wheat fields with severe nematode disease, so some people suspected it was a type of nematode disease. In recent years, it has occurred sporadically in various places. In the Tanghe area, it was quite serious last year, and farmers called it "worm yellow glutinous ear." Its symptoms are: wheat grains turn into yellow, sticky liquid that flows out. If the outer glume occurs early, the glume appears green, and there is a small yellow grain block inside. Some cannot head. If it occurs later, good grains are mixed in the ear.

　　The period of occurrence in the Tanghe River basin is in mid-May, after flowering and during grain formation, and it all appears from late May to early June.

　　The occurrence is more serious in humid areas, and more serious in dense areas where there is no ventilation in the center, while it is lighter around the edges and in sparsely populated areas.

　　The variety is the most important factor related to the occurrence of this disease. Local white wheat is almost entirely affected. Local "Huoliaomang" is relatively light, while "72 Wheat" is not affected. Therefore, the locals often say, "Even if you don't want to plant 72 Wheat, you have to plant it." This year, 72 Wheat has reached 90 percent, and it is estimated that it will reach 100 percent next year. Farmers like to plant 72 Wheat, not only because it is resistant to rust, but also because it is resistant to head smut, which is one of the main reasons. After the occurrence of head smut this year, most of the locals inquired about prevention methods, but no bacteria were found under microscopic examination. At present, there is no effective treatment method. The quick and easy prevention method is to switch to 72 Wheat. At the same time, Shennan Farm conducted a survey to understand the degree of loss. Fortunately, the local varieties in Shennan Beach are no longer the main ones, and only a few households have suffered losses.

　　Block　　Total Ears　　Smutted Ears　　Other Diseased Ears　　Diseased Ears %
　　First Block　　605　　90　　　　16.2%
　　Second Block　　768　　34　　3 (Nematode)　　4.4%
　　Third Block　　671　　314　　　　46.8%
　　Fourth Block　　553　　192　　　　34.7%

　　It can be seen from the above table that the least affected area among the four blocks accounts for 4.4%, and the most affected area accounts for 46.8%. The severity has reached a considerable level. Fortunately, 72 Wheat and Huoliaomang have strong resistance to the disease. In addition to vigorously promoting them, special attention should also be paid to the prevention and research of this disease.

　　小麦蜜穗调查
    神南华北稻作试验场  马矍翁
    小麦蜜穗，民国二十二年定县地带即曾发现。当时大多在线虫病较严重的麦田发生，因此有人怀疑是线虫病的一种。近几年来各地陆续发生，在唐河地带去年即相当严重，农民把它叫做“虫黄胶穗”，其病状：麦粒变为黄黏液流出，外颖发生早者，则颖现绿色，内有一小黄粒块，间有不能抽穗者。发生较晚者，一穗上间杂有好粒。
    发生时期，在唐河流域于五月中旬开花后结粒时即有发生，在五月下旬至六月初即全部现出。
    发生情形，在潮湿地带比较严重，稠密地方，不通风的中心地带比较严重，而四周边行及苗株疏落地方则比较轻。
    此病发生关系最大者为品种，本地白麦几乎全部发生，本地火燎芒比较轻，七二小麦则不发生，因此老乡常说“你想不种七二小麦你也得种”，今年七二小麦已达到百分之九十，估计明年可达百分之百。农民喜种七二小麦，其原因固然是由于它能抗锈病，但抗蜜穗亦为主要原因之一。今年蜜穗病发生后，多数老乡询问防治方法，但在镜检下即见不到病菌，目前也尚无有效的除治法，捷便的防止办了法就是换种七二小麦。同时神南农场做了一个调查，解损失程度，所幸今年神南滩本地种已不占主要地位，仅有个别户遭受损失。
    区块　　总穗数　　蜜穗数　　其他病穗　　病穗％
    第一区块　　六○五　　九○　    　一六·二％
    第二区块　　七六八　　三四　　三（线虫）　　四·四％
    第三区块　　六七一　　三一四　　　　四六·八％
    第四区块　　五五三　　一九二　　　　　三四·七％
    由上表可以看出，在四区块中发生最少者占４．４％，最多者占４６．８％，其严重性已达相当程度。所幸七二小麦与火燎芒抗病力尚强，除应极力推广外，故对此病之预防与研究，亦应引起特别注意。
