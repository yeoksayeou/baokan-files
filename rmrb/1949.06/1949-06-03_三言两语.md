　　Brief Comments

　　Student's Exemplary Actions
    The assessment of People's Student Aid Funds in various schools in Ping City has concluded, and many students have voluntarily given up or reduced the amount of aid, saving a huge amount of millet for the people. They cherish the people's millet, reduce the burden on the people, and are willing to live a more frugal and simple life. This is a revolutionary mass perspective and a valuable expression of their enthusiasm for the people. This year, drought has appeared in various parts of North China, and insect pests have also arisen, which will likely lead to a poor harvest. All localities must practice strict economy, saving every grain of rice to prepare for lean years. The exemplary actions of students in Beiping are worthy of emulation.
  　Not a Miracle
    During the Japanese puppet regime, the Northwest Steel Plant failed several times to roll steel rails. After the bandit Yan returned to Shanxi, he didn't even dare to try. However, once the people's era began, it was successfully rolled in just over forty days. It sounds like a miracle, but it's actually very clear: Japanese imperialism treated workers as "Chink pigs"; Yan Xishan regarded workers as "mules that can be ridden and burdened." Under their rule, workers could only be unlucky: they couldn't even fill their own stomachs, and they had to swear an oath to become cannon fodder. Today, however, workers have completely changed their past status politically and economically. They have personally experienced that the Communist Party has brought them a future and have become the masters of the country and the factory. With a new attitude towards labor, consciously working hard, of course, they will have endless power to create new historical achievements.

　　三言两语
　　学生的模范行动
    平市各校人民助学金评定终了，许多同学自动放弃或减低助学金数额，替人民节省下巨量小米，他们爱惜人民的小米，减轻人民的负担，情愿自己过比较省俭刻苦的生活，这是革命的群众观点，是对人民热情的可宝贵的表现。今年华北各地已露旱象，目前虫害又起，势将歉收，各地都要厉行节约，省下一米一粟以备荒年，北平学生的模范行动值得效法。
  　不是奇迹
    在日伪时期，西北炼钢厂数次试碾铁轨没有成功，阎匪回井后根本就没敢试；但是，人民的时代一开始，四十来天就试碾成功了。说来是奇迹，其实也很明白：日本帝国主义把工人当做支那猪猡看待；阎锡山把工人当作“可骑可驮的骡马”，在他们统治下，工人只有倒霉：连自己的肚皮都装不满，还得宣誓去当炮灰。今天呢，工人却从政治上经济上完全改变了过去的地位，亲身体验到共产党给他们带来了前途，成了国家与工厂的主人。有了新的劳动态度。自觉地努力工作，当然便有了无穷的力量来创造新的史迹。
