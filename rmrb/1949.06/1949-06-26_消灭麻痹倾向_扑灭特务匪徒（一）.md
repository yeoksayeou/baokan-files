　　Eliminate Paralysis, Extinguish Special Agent Bandits (I)
    In his speech at the opening ceremony of the preparatory meeting for the new Political Consultative Conference, Chairman Mao pointed out to the people of the whole country that once the Chinese Democratic Coalition Government is established, its first important task will be to "eliminate the remnants of the reactionaries and suppress the sabotage of the reactionaries." Chairman Mao said: "The imperialists and their running dogs, the Chinese reactionaries, will not be reconciled to their failure on this land of China. They will still collude with each other and use all possible methods to oppose the Chinese people. For example, sending their running dogs into China to carry out divisive work and sabotage. This is inevitable, and they will never forget this task. For example, instigating the Chinese reactionaries, and even adding their own strength, to blockade China's seaports. As long as they have the possibility, they will do so. Furthermore, if they still want to take risks, it is not impossible to send a part of their forces to harass China's borders. We must fully estimate all of these. We must not, because of victory, relax our vigilance against the imperialist elements and their running dogs' crazy revenge conspiracies. Whoever relaxes this vigilance will disarm politically and put himself in a passive position. Under such circumstances, the people of the whole country must unite and resolutely, thoroughly, cleanly, and completely smash any conspiracy plan of the imperialists and their running dogs, the Chinese reactionaries, against the Chinese people."
    The sabotage conspiracies of foreign imperialists and their running dogs, the Chinese reactionaries, are being exposed more and more every day. This is because the reactionaries' open armed struggle against the Chinese people has failed, and is increasingly giving way to covert struggles. In the cities, before the Kuomintang bandit gangs fled or were annihilated, they had, under the instructions and with the help of the imperialists, planned and arranged for lurking special agent activities in advance. After liberation, the special agent bandits spread rumors, spied on intelligence, organized robberies and assassinations, disrupted social order; printed counterfeit money, disrupted finance, distorted the policies and decrees of the people's government, provoked labor-capital disputes, and hindered the rapid recovery of production; they used arson, explosions, and other sabotage methods to destroy the country's factories, mines, warehouses, and their various equipment and materials. The Shenyang American spy case, the arson and assassination atrocities of the Kuomintang special agent bandits in Beiping, and the various sabotage activities carried out by Chinese and foreign saboteurs in Shanghai, show that the imperialists and the Kuomintang bandit gangs are carrying out large-scale special agent activities to resist and undermine the people's democratic rule. In the rural areas, especially in the vast rural areas of Henan, Anhui, Hubei, and Jiangnan, which have not been liberated for long, the Kuomintang bandit gangs are sending large numbers of special agents to collude with local counter-revolutionary despots, using feudal secret societies, organizing bandits, burning, killing, raping, and plundering, harming the people, and even attacking district and village government organs and local people's armed forces, disrupting the rear of the People's Liberation Army. Facts tell us that without thoroughly eliminating these special agent bandits, social order and people's lives will not be stable, various revolutionary tasks will be difficult to advance, and another important task proposed by Chairman Mao, namely, restoring and developing the people's economic and cultural and educational undertakings, will not be able to be smoothly realized.
    Of course, it is just a dream for the imperialists and the Kuomintang bandit gangs to try to overthrow the establishment of an independent, democratic, prosperous, and strong new China through the sabotage of special agent bandits. But if we underestimate these enemies, thinking that the revolution has been victorious and everything is going well, and that we can just shout a few "long live" slogans and go to sleep peacefully, then that is a huge mistake. The enemy has failed, but has not been completely eliminated. "After the enemy with guns is eliminated, the enemy without guns still exists, and they are bound to fight us to the death." Moreover, the closer the enemy gets to death, the more crazy and brutal they become. If we do not firmly remember Chairman Mao's warning and relax our vigilance, then we will suffer a great loss and cause the people's democratic motherland to suffer many avoidable losses. In the past, the reason why special agent bandits in some places were able to achieve their destructive goals was precisely because our cadres were more or less politically paralyzed. Now and in the future, especially at the present time when the new China is just being established, the enemy will definitely take advantage of our difficulties to resist and undermine the people's country. The question is whether we ourselves are constantly vigilant, organize forces, and fight against this kind of sabotage activity by the enemy.
    Countless facts have given us enough lessons, requiring us Communists, personnel of the People's Government and mass organizations, and people of all democratic strata to be highly vigilant, jointly launch a struggle to eliminate traitors and prevent special agents, extinguish the conspiracy activities of the imperialist running dogs and Kuomintang special agent bandits, and defend the people's motherland. We must take resolute and cautious steps and carry out meticulous and detailed organizational work to suppress the sabotage of these counter-revolutionary elements. Therefore, on the one hand, we must overcome arrogance, complacency, and indifference; on the other hand, we must also prevent groundless suspicions and alarming the snake by stirring the grass. For the special agent bandits who are caught, we should adopt different treatment methods according to the severity of the circumstances. For those who were coerced into participating and sincerely repent, we can be lenient and give them a way to rehabilitate themselves; for those die-hard counter-revolutionary elements who have done many evils and do not know how to repent, we should promote the authority of the people's democratic regime, severely punish them, and eliminate harm for the people!

### 消灭麻痹倾向　扑灭特务匪徒（一）

　　消灭麻痹倾向　扑灭特务匪徒（一）
    毛主席在新的政治协商会议筹备会开幕典礼的讲话中，向全国人民指出中国民主联合政府一经成立，它的第一项重要任务将是“肃清反动派的残余，镇压反动派的捣乱”。毛主席说：“帝国主义者及其走狗中国反动派对于他们在中国这块土地上的失败，是不会甘心的。他们还会要互相勾结在一起，用各种可能的方法，反对中国人民。例如，派遣他们的走狗钻进中国内部来进行分化工作和捣乱工作。这是必然的，他们决不会忘记这一项工作。例如，唆使中国反动派，甚至加上他们自己的力量，封锁中国的海港。只要他们还有可能，他们就会这样做。再则，假如他们还想冒险的话，派出一部分兵力侵扰中国的边境，也不是不可能的。所有这些，我们均必须充分地估计到。我们决不可因为胜利，而放松对于帝国主义分子及其走狗们的疯狂的报复阴谋的警惕性。谁要是放松这一项警惕性，谁就将在政治上解除武装，而使自己处于被动的地位。在这种情况下，全国人民必须团结起来，坚决彻底干净全部地粉碎帝国主义者及其走狗中国反动派的任何一项反对中国人民的阴谋计划。”
    外国帝国主义者及其走狗中国反动派的捣乱阴谋，正在一天比一天更多地暴露了出来。这是因为反动派对于中国人民的公开的武装的斗争已经失败，正在一天比一天更多地让位于隐蔽的斗争。在城市中，国民党匪帮在溃逃或被歼以前，便在帝国主义者的指使和帮助之下，预先有计划地布置好了潜伏的特务活动。解放以后，特务匪徒们便施放谣言，侦刺情报，组织抢劫暗杀，扰乱社会治安；印制假钞，捣乱金融，歪曲人民政府的政策法令，挑拨劳资纠纷，阻碍生产的迅速恢复；他们用纵火、爆炸和其他暗害方法，破坏国家的工厂、矿山、仓库及其各种设备和物资。沈阳的美国间谍案，北平国民党特务匪徒的纵火和暗杀暴行，以及中外破坏分子在上海所进行的形形色色的捣乱工作，显示帝国主义者和国民党匪帮，正在大规模地利用特务活动，对于人民民主统治进行反抗和破坏。在农村，尤其是解放不久的河南、安徽、湖北和江南广大农村，国民党匪帮正大批派遣特务，勾结当地反革命的恶霸分子，利用封建会门，组织土匪，烧杀淫掠，祸害人民，甚至袭击区村政府机关和地方人民武装，捣乱人民解放军后方。事实告诉我们：不彻底肃清这些特务匪徒，社会秩序和人民生活将无法安定，各项革命工作将很难推进，毛主席所提出的另一重要任务，即恢复和发展人民经济事业和文化教育事业，也将不能顺利地实现。
    当然，帝国主义者和国民党匪帮要想以特务匪徒的捣乱破坏，来推翻独立民主富强的新中国的建立，那只是做梦。但如果我们轻视这些敌人，以为革命胜利，万事大吉，只要多喊几个“万岁”，就可安心睡觉，寻就是极大的错误了。敌人虽然已经失败，但是还没有完全消灭。“在拿枪的敌人被消灭以后，不拿枪的敌人依然存在，他们必然地要和我们做拼死的斗争”。而且敌人越是接近死亡，便越是疯狂和残暴。如果我们不牢牢记住毛主席的告诫，放松警惕，那么我们就会吃大亏，就会使人民民主祖国遭受许多可以避免的损失。过去若干地方特务匪徒之所以能够达到破坏的目的，正无一不是由于我们的干部在政治上或多或少的麻痹所致。现在和将来，特别是目前新中国刚刚在建立的时机，敌人是一定会利用我们的困难，对人民的国家进行反抗和破坏的，问题在于我们自己是否经常地保持戒备状态，组织力量，和敌人的这种捣乱活动进行斗争。
    无数的事实已经给予我们足够的教训，要求我们共产党员、人民政府和民众团体的工作人员和各民主阶层的人民，高度警觉起来，共同展开除奸防特的斗争，扑灭帝国主义走狗国民党特务匪徒的阴谋活动，保卫人民的祖国。我们要采取坚决的而又谨慎的步骤，进行周密细致的组织工作，来镇压这些反革命分子的捣乱。因此，一方面要克服骄傲自大，麻木不仁；另方面也要防止捕风捉影，打草惊蛇。对于查获的特务匪徒，应按情节轻重采取分别对待的办法，对那些被胁迫参加，真心悔过的分子，可宽大处理，给以自新之路；对那些作恶多端，不知改悔的死心塌地的反革命分子，应该发扬人民民主政权的威权，严加征办，为民除害！
