　　Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 7th: According to a Warsaw dispatch from the Polish Press Agency: The Polish Trade Union Congress, lasting five days, concluded on the 5th. At the meeting on the fifth day, the Congress warmly welcomed the delegation of the Farmers' Mutual Aid League. The delegation representative told the Congress that thousands of villages have guaranteed to increase the supply of industrial raw materials and food for the cities. The Congress adopted the new constitution. The guiding spirit of the new constitution is to bring the general organization and branches of the trade union, as well as the vast number of workers, closer together. The new constitution stipulates that the new organizational unit is the factory branch, which will enable members to be closer to the trade union organization, and the trade union organization to be closer to the production process. According to the new constitution, the Central Committee of the Trade Union will be replaced by a Central Council with greater authority. The Congress elected the Central Council, consisting of ninety-nine members and thirty-three alternate members, and elected a presidium of twenty-one people from among them.

　　波工代会闭幕　通过新会章选出中央理事会
    【新华社北平七日电】据波兰通讯社华沙讯：历时五日的波兰职工会代表大会，已于五日闭幕。在第五日会议上，大会热烈欢迎了农民互助联盟的代表团。该代表团代表告诉大会说，数以千计的农村已保证增加对工业原料和城市食粮的供应。大会通过了新会章。新会章的主导精神是使职工会的总机构和分会以及广大工人接近。新会章规定新的组织单位为工厂分会，它将使会员更能接近职工会组织，而职工会组织更能接近生产过程。依照新会章，职工会中央委员会将由职权更大的中央理事会代替。大会选出了包括九十九名理事和三十三名候补理事的中央理事会，并由其中选出二十一人组成主席团。
