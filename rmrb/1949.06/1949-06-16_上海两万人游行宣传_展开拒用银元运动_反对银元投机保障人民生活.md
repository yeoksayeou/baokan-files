Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, June 15th: The people of Shanghai are enthusiastically launching a movement to oppose silver dollar speculators and reject the use of silver dollars. Simultaneously with the Shanghai Military Control Commission and the People's Government's inspection of the Securities Exchange Building, the concentration point for silver dollar speculators, over 20,000 workers, students, and People's Liberation Army propaganda teams held a grand parade and campaign on the 11th and 12th, themed "Oppose Silver Dollar Speculation, Protect People's Livelihood." They used speeches, songs, chats, and other means to expose the crimes of bandits, special agents, and unscrupulous merchants engaged in silver dollar speculation, and answered various questions from citizens. On Nanjing East Road and the Bund area, students from Fudan University and Shanghai Girls' High School patiently persuaded and educated the vendors and silver dollar peddlers along the roadside in groups, listened to their opinions, and engaged them in discussions. Workers at the Shanghai Electric Power Company specially installed a loudspeaker to explain to the citizens the reasons for rising prices, the methods of value-linked savings, and the significance of organizing cooperatives. Slogans such as "Outlaw Silver Dollar Trading," "Report Secret Agents Intentionally Disrupting Finance," and "Support Renminbi to Protect the People's Interests" were posted on trams and buses. Dozens of propaganda teams composed of municipal garrison troops, led by the heads of their respective regiments, conducted propaganda among the citizens. The citizens warmly supported the call to reject silver dollars and the various measures of the People's Government. One worker said, "Since the People's Liberation Army and the government support us in eliminating silver dollar speculation, offer value-linked savings, and lead us in running cooperatives, the methods are really appropriate, and our lives will definitely stabilize in the future." The Shanghai Democratic Women's Federation Provisional United Association, the China Technology Association, the University Professors' Association, the Fine Arts Association, the Woodcut Association, and the Cartoon Association Federation also held meetings to call on everyone to wage a resolute struggle against silver dollar speculators. Employees of the Shanghai Branch of the Postal Savings and Remittance Bureau, the Shanghai Telecommunications Bureau, and the Land Administration Bureau launched a signature campaign, guaranteeing that they would never buy or sell silver dollars after receiving their salaries, and persuading their relatives and friends not to use silver dollars either. Many store windows displayed signs stating, "We only accept Renminbi; silver dollars are not accepted." Furthermore, the Shanghai Branch of the Bank of China and its various offices, in accordance with the order of the East China District Branch of the People's Bank of China, began accepting silver dollars for exchange on the 11th. Many citizens went to exchange them.
