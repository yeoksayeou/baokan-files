  　II. Methods of Studying Chinese History (Continued XI)
    Under the capitalist system, the foundation of production relations is the capitalist ownership of the means of production. At the same time, there is no longer private ownership of the workforce. The workforce, i.e., the wage laborers, cannot be slaughtered or sold by the capitalists, because wage laborers are free from personal dependence. However, they do not own the means of production, so they have no choice but to sell their labor to the capitalists to avoid starvation, and endure heavy exploitation. In addition to the capitalist ownership of the means of production, there also exists the private ownership of the means of production based on the labor of peasants and handicraftsmen who are free from serfdom dependence, and this kind of private ownership was very popular in the early period. Handicraft workshops and manufactories have been replaced by mechanized large factories. Aristocratic estates cultivated with peasants' crude production tools have been replaced by capitalist large farms managed according to agronomy and using agricultural machinery.
    The new productive forces require production workers who are more cultured and clever than the closed-minded and ignorant serfs, who can understand machines and use them correctly. Therefore, capitalists prefer to employ wage laborers who are free from the bondage of serfdom and have a certain level of culture to use machines correctly.
    However, when capitalism develops productive forces to a huge scale, it falls into contradictions that it cannot solve. Capitalism produces an increasing number of commodities and lowers commodity prices, which intensifies competition, bankrupts a large number of small and medium-sized private owners, turns them into proletarians, and reduces their purchasing power, thus making it impossible to sell the produced commodities. Capitalism expands production and assembles millions of workers in large factories, which gives the production process a public character, thus undermining its own foundation, because the public nature of the production process requires public ownership of the means of production, while the ownership of the means of production is still capitalist private ownership, i.e., ownership that is incompatible with the public nature of the production process.
    This irreconcilable contradiction between the nature of productive forces and production relations is exposed in periodic crises of overproduction. At this time, the capitalist, because he himself makes the broad masses of the people suffer bankruptcy and cannot find demanders with the ability to pay, has to burn products, eliminate finished goods, stop production, and destroy productive forces; at this time, millions of people are forced to be unemployed and starve, not because there are not enough commodities, but because too many commodities are produced.
    This means that capitalist production relations are no longer suited to the state of social productive forces, but are in an irreconcilable contradiction with social productive forces.
    This means that a revolution is maturing in the capitalist system, whose mission is to replace the existing capitalist ownership of the means of production with the socialist ownership of the means of production.
    This means that the sharpest class struggle between exploiters and the exploited is the basic characteristic of the capitalist system.
    Under the socialist system, a system that has only been realized in the Soviet Union at this moment, the public ownership of the means of production is the foundation of production relations. There are no exploiters or exploited here. The produced goods are distributed according to labor according to the principle of "he who does not work, neither shall he eat." The characteristic of the relationship between people in the production process here is the comradely cooperation and socialist mutual assistance among workers who are not exploited. Here, production relations are completely in line with the state of productive forces, because the public nature of the production process is consolidated by the public ownership of the means of production.
    Therefore, socialist production in the Soviet Union fundamentally does not know what periodic crises of overproduction are, as well as the absurd phenomena associated with this crisis.
    Therefore, productive forces are developing rapidly here, because production relations suitable for productive forces give productive forces ample room for such development.
    This is the situation of the development of people's production relations in human history.
    This is the dependence of the development of production relations on the development of social productive forces, first of all on the development of production tools, and because of this dependence, the change and development of productive forces will sooner or later cause the change and development of production relations to adapt to it.
    Marx said:
    "The use and creation of means of labor★, although their rudimentary forms are inherent in certain animals, are after all the unique characteristics of the human labor process, so Franklin said that humans are tool-making animals. The remains of the means of labor are of great significance for studying the socio-economic forms that have disappeared, just as the structural remains of animal bones are for studying the physical organization of extinct animals. The economic eras are distinguished not by what is produced, but by how it is produced.... The means of labor are not only a measure of the development of human labor power, but also an indicator of the social relations in which labor is realized." (Marx, "Capital", Volume 1, page 121, 1935 edition)
    ★The "means of labor" referred to by Marx mainly refers to production tools. — Editor's note of "A Brief History of the Communist Party (Bolsheviks) of the Soviet Union."
    Secondly:
    (1) "Social relations are closely linked to productive forces. As people acquire new productive forces, they change their mode of production, and as the mode of production changes, that is, the way of ensuring their own lives changes, people also change all their social relations. The hand-operated mill produced a society headed by feudal lords; the steam-powered mill produced a society headed by industrial capitalists." ("Complete Works of Marx and Engels", Volume 5, page 364)
    (2) "The movement of increasing productive forces, the destruction of social relations, and the generation of ideas are all happening continuously, the only thing that is motionless is the abstraction of movement." (Ibid., page 364)
    Engels, in explaining the historical materialism expressed in the "Communist Manifesto," said:
    "The economic production of each historical era and the social structure that necessarily arises from it are the basis of the political and intellectual history of this era.... Corresponding to this is that—since the disintegration of the primitive communal land ownership system—all history is the history of class struggle, that is, the history of the struggle between the exploited and the exploiters, the dominated and the ruling classes at various stages of social development.... At the stage that this struggle has now reached, the exploited and oppressed class (the proletariat), in order to get rid of the class that exploits and oppresses it (the bourgeoisie), must at the same time free the entire society forever from exploitation, oppression, and class struggle...." (Engels' preface to the German edition of the "Manifesto")
    (D) The third characteristic of production is that the process of generating new productive forces and production relations suitable for them does not occur separately from the old system, not after the old system is eliminated, but within the old system; not as a result of people's intentional and conscious activities, but spontaneously, unconsciously, and independently of people's will. The reason why it is spontaneous and independent of people's will is due to the following two reasons.
    The first reason is that people cannot freely choose this or that mode of production, because when each new generation begins to live, they have already encountered ready-made productive forces and production relations, that is, the result of the work of the previous generation, so this new generation should initially accept everything ready-made that they encounter in production, and should adapt to these things in order to be able to produce material materials.
    The second reason is that when people improve this or that production tool, this or that element of productive forces, they will not realize, will not understand, and will not think about what kind of social consequences these improvements will cause, but only think about their own daily interests, only want to lighten their labor, and seek some direct and tangible benefits.

　　中国历史教程绪论

  　二、研究中国历史的方法（续十一）
    在资本主义制度下，生产关系的基础是生产资料的资本主义所有制，同时这里已经没有了私自占有生产工作者的情形，这是生产工作者即雇佣工人，是资本家既不能屠杀，也不能出卖的，因为雇佣工人已免除了人格上的依赖，但他们却没有生产资料，所以他们为要不致饿死，便不得不出卖自己的劳动力给资本家，并忍受繁重的剥削。除资本主义的生产资料所有制外，还存在有免除了农奴制依赖的农民和手工业者以本身劳动为基础占有生产资料的私有制，而且这种私有制在第一个时期是很流行的。手工作坊和手工工场企业已由机器化的大工厂所代替了。用农民粗笨生产工具耕作的贵族地产，已由根据农艺学经营和使用农业机器的资本主义大农场所代替了。
    新的生产力所需要的是比闭塞无知的农奴们文化些，伶俐些，能够懂得机器并正确使用机器的生产工作者。因此，资本家宁愿利用免除了农奴制羁绊而有相当文化程度来正确使用机器的雇佣工人。
    可是，资本主义把生产力发展到巨大规模的时候，便陷入它自己所不能解决的矛盾中。资本主义生产出日益增多的商品并减低着商品价格，便使竞争尖锐化，使大批小私有主和中等私有主陷于破产，把他们变成无产者，减低他们的购买力，因而就使生产出来的商品无法销售出去。资本主义扩大生产并把千百万工人集合在大工厂内，便使生产过程具有了公共的性质，因而破坏了自己本身的基础，因为生产过程的公共性质要求有生产资料的公有制，而生产资料的所有制却仍然是资本主义私人性的，即与生产过程的公共性质势不两立的所有制。
    生产力性质与生产关系间这种不可调和的矛盾，是暴露于周期的生产过剩危机中，此时资本家因他本身使广大民众遭受破产而找不到有支付能力的需求者，便不得不烧毁生产品，消灭已制成的商品，停止生产，破坏生产力；此时千百万民众被迫失业挨饿，而这并不是由于商品不够，却是因为商品出产太多。
    这就是说，资本主义的生产关系已不复与社会生产力状况相适合，而是已与社会生产力处于不可调和的矛盾地位。
    这就是说，在资本主义制度里成熟着革命，其使命就是要用社会主义的生产资料所有制来代替现存的资本主义生产资料的所有制。
    这就是说，剥削者和被剥削者间最尖锐的阶级斗争，乃是资本主义制度的基本特征。
    在社会主义制度下，在此刻还只实现于苏联的这个制度下生产资料的公有制是生产关系的基础。这里已没有什么剥削者，也没有什么被剥削者。生产出来的物品是根据“不劳动者不得食”的原则来按劳动分配的。这里生产过程中人们相互关系的特征，乃是不受剥削的工作者们间同志的合作和社会主义的互助。这里生产关系与生产力状况完全相合，因为生产过程的公共性质是由生产资料的公有制所巩固的。
    因此，苏联的社会主义生产也就根本不知道什么是周期的生产过剩危机，以及与此危机相联结的荒谬现象。
    因此，生产力在这里是加速发展着，因为适合于生产力的生产关系使生产力有这样发展的充分广阔的余地。
    这就是人类史上人们生产关系发展的情景。
    这就是生产关系发展对于社会生产力发展，首先是对于生产工具发展的依赖性，而因为有这种依赖性，所以生产力的变更和发展迟早要引起生产关系与此相适应的变更和发展。
    马克思说：
    “劳动资料★的使用和创造，虽其萌芽形式已为某几种动物所固有。毕竟是人类劳动过程所独具的特征，所以佛兰格林说人类是制造工具的动物。劳动资料的遗骸对于研究已经消亡的诸社会经济形态，也如动物骨骼的遗骸结构对于研究已消亡的诸种动物的躯体组织一样，有极重要的意义。各个经济时代所由以区别的不是生产什么，而是怎样生产……。劳动资料不仅是人类劳动力发展的尺度，而且是劳动在其中实现的社会关系的指标。”（马克思，“资本论”，第一卷，第一二一页，一九三五年版）
    ★马克思所说的“劳动资料”，主要是指生产工具而言。——“苏联共产党（布）历史简要读本”编者注。
    其次：
    （１）“社会关系是和生产力密切联结的。人们既获得新的生产力，便会改变自己的生产方式，而随着生产方式的改变，即本身生活保证方式的改变，人们也就会改变自己所有一切社会关系。手力的磨坊产生了以封建主为首的社会；蒸汽力的磨坊产生了以工业资本家为首的社会。”（“马恩全集”，第五卷，第三六四页）
    （２）“生产力增长的运动，社会关系的破坏以及思想的产生都是毫不间断地发生着，不动的只是运动底抽象。”（同上，第三六四页）
    恩格斯在解释“共产党宣言”内所表述的历史唯物主义时说道：
    “每一历史时代底经济生产以及必然从它发生的社会结构，便是这时代的政治和思想历史底基础……。与此相适应的，是——自从原始公社的土地占有制瓦解时起，——全部历史都是阶级斗争的历史，即社会发展各阶段上被剥削阶级与剥削阶级，被支配阶级与统治阶级间斗争的历史……。在这个斗争现今所达到了的阶段上，被剥削被压迫的阶级（无产阶级）为要摆脱掉剥削它压迫它的那个阶级（资产阶级），已非同时使整个社会永远摆脱剥削，压迫以及阶级斗争不可了……。”（恩格斯为“宣言”德文版所作的序言）
    （丁）生产底第三个特点就在新的生产力以及与其相适合的生产关系产生的过程，并不是离开旧制度而单独发生，不是在旧制度消灭以后发生，而是在旧制度内部发生；不是由于人们有意自觉活动底结果，而是自发地，不自觉地，不依人们意志为转移地发生的。其所以是自发的和不依人们意志为转移地发生，是由于以下两个原因。
    第一个原因，就是人们不能自由选定这种或那种生产方式，因为每一新辈人开始生活时，他们已遇到现成的生产力和生产关系，即前辈人所工作的结果，因此这新辈人在最初一个时候，应当接受他们在生产方面所遇到的一切现成东西，应当去适应这些东西，以便有可能生产物质资料。
    第二个原因，就是人们在改善这种或那种生产工具，这种或那种生产力要素时，不会觉悟到，不会了解到，也不会想到这些改善将会引起怎样一种社会结果，而只是想到自己的日常利益，只是想要减轻自己的劳动，谋得某种直接的、可以感触到的益处。（未完）
