　　Pingjin Communications Bank Supports Industry and Mining
　　Launches Order and Real Value Business
　　[Report from this newspaper] The Beiping Communications Bank will begin using "Order Loans" and "Real Value Loans" from June to support industry and mining. In the past, the bank mostly used credit loans to support industry and mining. Although this played a significant role in supporting development, there were still some shortcomings in maintaining the strength of specialized banks in supporting production and ensuring the use of loans. Therefore, the bank will switch to "Order Loans" and "Real Value Loans" from June and will focus on pilot investments. The scope of goods for order loans is mainly those closely related to the national economy and the people's livelihood. Private factories (referring to those of larger scale) that lack funds for production can list the goods they can manufacture, their prices, and the equivalent loan amount and apply for loans from the bank in accordance with the order loan method. Upon maturity, the goods will be delivered according to the contract. Real value loans refer to the borrower (referring to factories, etc.) applying for a loan, specifying the unit price of a certain raw material they need or the unit price of a certain finished product they can manufacture. The loan amount and the interest due upon maturity will be converted into a certain amount of the specified raw material or finished product, and the IOU will be filled out. Upon maturity, the borrower will return the specified quantity of goods to the bank according to the price at the time of repayment, with the actual monthly interest rate ranging from six to twelve per thousand.

　　平交通银行扶植工矿业
  　举办定货折实业务
    【本报讯】北平交通银行于六月份起开始采用“定货贷款”与“折实贷款”两种方式，以进行扶植工矿业的业务。该行过去对工、矿扶植多采用信用放款方式，在扶植效果上虽起到相当作用，但在保持专业银行扶植生产之力量及保证贷款用途上尚存在若干缺点，因此该行于六月份起改用“定货贷款”与“折实贷款”方式，并选择重点试办投资。定货贷款之货品范围：以与国计民生关系密切者为主，私营工厂（指规模较大者）因生产缺乏资金，可开列自己能制造之货品、价格、折合借款金额依照定货贷款办法向该行申请贷款，到期按合同交货。折实放款系借户（指工厂等）申请借款时，指定以自己所需某项原料之单价或以自己能制造之某项成品单价为准，将所借之款及到期后应付之利息折成指定某项原料或成品若干，填明借据，到期后借户即按规定货品数量，照归还时价格折款归还该行，实物月息六厘至一分二厘不等。（宇）
