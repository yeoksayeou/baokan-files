　　Hua University Commemorates Teachers' Day
　　All Faculty Members Hold Symposium
    Wu Yuzhang Comrade Calls for Cultivating Talent in All Fields
    [Reported by this newspaper] To commemorate "June 6th" Teachers' Day, North China University held a symposium for all faculty members at 2:00 PM on June 5th. President Wu Yuzhang, Vice Presidents Fan Wenlan and Cheng Fangwu, Dean of the Agricultural College Le Tianyu, department directors, section chiefs, and 90 faculty members attended the meeting. At the meeting, President Wu Yuzhang spoke first, pointing out that in the year since its establishment, Hua University has gloriously completed the tasks assigned to it by the Party and made great achievements. This is the result of the correct leadership of the Party Central Committee, Chairman Mao, and the North China Bureau, as well as the enthusiastic and active work of the faculty and staff. Now the situation is developing rapidly, and a large number of cadres who are firm in their stance and capable of working in all fields are needed. Therefore, our task is even more important. Now we are in an era of revolution, and we must sprint in the shortest possible time to train a large number of cadres. In the future, during the period of large-scale construction, we will also have a more planned and step-by-step approach to cultivate a large number of talents in all fields over a longer period of time. When he talked about the teaching policy, he emphasized the need to link theory with practice, not only to give students the basic theory of Marxism-Leninism, but also to give them practical working methods, cultivate their revolutionary work style, so that after they go to work, they not only have a firm position but also can be flexible in their application. Finally, he encouraged everyone to teach enthusiastically, strengthen planning, streamline work, and pay special attention to contact with students. Vice President Fan Wenlan emphasized in his speech that North China University is a revolutionary university, which is very different from the old-style universities. North China University has nearly 15,000 students, but very few teachers. Everyone does a lot of work, but everyone has developed a hard-working revolutionary style and worked hard and happily to complete the tasks assigned to them by the Party, while the living conditions are very low.
    Vice President Cheng Fangwu pointed out in his speech that the task of training cadres at Hua University is very arduous and urgent recently. He called on everyone to improve the quality of teaching and work efficiency. He also announced that an education work conference will be held to solve these problems. At the same time, in order to strengthen the unity of faculty and staff, alleviate some difficulties, and carry out recreational activities, he proposed that a faculty and staff union should be established immediately. Ai Siqi, deputy director of the Fourth Department, suggested holding more faculty meetings to carry out criticism and self-criticism in teaching work.
    Finally, Yin Da, Director of the Academic Affairs Office, suggested that the faculty and staff union should be prepared immediately, and hoped that everyone would start to think about it. The meeting did not end until 5:30 PM. After the meeting, a dinner party was held and an evening party was held to add to the fun. (Yu Piao)

　　华大纪念教师节
  　全校教员举行座谈
    吴玉章同志号召培养各方面人材
    【本报讯】华北大学为了纪念“六六”教师节，特于六月五日下午二时召开全校教员座谈会，到会有吴玉章校长，范文澜、成仿吾副校长，农学院院长乐天宇，各部主任、各处长及教员共九十人。会上首先由吴玉章校长讲话，他指出：华大成立一年来，光荣地完成了党所赋予华大的任务，作出了很大的成绩，这是党中央、毛主席华北局正确的领导，和教职员同志们热情地积极地工作的结果，现在时局发展的很快，需要大批的立场坚定能作工作的各方面的干部，因此，我们的任务更加重大。现在我们是处在革命的时代，我们要以最短的时间突击，培养大批的干部，将来大规模建设时期，我们并且要更有计划地有步骤地以较长的时间，大量培养各方面的人材。当他谈到教学方针时，强调指出要做到理论和实际联系，不但要给同学们以马列主义的基本理论，并且要给他们以实际工作的方法，培养他们的革命的工作作风，使他们走上工作岗位后，不但有坚定不移的立场而且能够灵活运用。最后他勉励大家热情的教学，加强计划性，工作条理化，特别要注重与同学的联系。范文澜副校长在讲话中着重说明了华北大学是革命的大学，它与旧式大学有很大的不同，华北大学，将近一万五千学生，但教员很少，大家作的工作很多，可是大家却发扬了艰苦的革命作风，紧张的愉快的工作，完成党所给予的任务。而生活待遇很低。
    成仿吾副校长在讲话中，指出最近华大培养干部的任务，十分艰巨而迫切，他号召大家提高教学质量与工作效率。并宣布要召开教育工作会议，来解决这些问题，同时为了加强教职员的团结，解放一些困难并展开文娱活动，他提出应即成立教职员联合会。四部副主任艾思奇同志建议多召开教员会议展开教学工作中的批评与自我批评。
    最后教务处处长尹达同志提出教职员联合会应即筹备，希望大家开始酝酿。直到五时半才散会，会后举行会餐并有晚会助兴。（余飘）
