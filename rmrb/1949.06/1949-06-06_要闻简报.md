    A certain detachment of the People's Liberation Army guarding the city of Xi'an maintained excellent discipline while performing guard duties. On the first day the troops entered Xi'an, they were stationed in the South Gate. At that time, they did not bring any luggage, and it was raining, so everyone slept on the bare ground. When the Kuomintang bandit gang fled, they left a pile of coats, but no one picked them up. The Fourth Squad of the detachment carefully protected the factory, not only preventing the factory's materials and machinery from being damaged, but also politely declining the food and comfort items sent by the factory and workers.
