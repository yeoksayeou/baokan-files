　　Thirty-Year Veteran Teacher, Lian Dehua
　　Huangfu Jin
　　Mr. Lian Dehua is from Jishan Village, Zuoquan County, Shanxi Province. For thirty years, he has lived among children. He spent most of his time teaching in Gu Village and Siping Village (the two villages are only a mile or two apart). Although he also served as the local central principal and deputy principal of the senior primary school, he still liked teaching children. Five years ago, he told me something to the effect of: "Look at how many anti-Japanese cadres have come out of Siping Village, serving as county committee members, section chiefs, district chiefs, and even regiment commanders... They used to study and play here when they were young, and now they have become pillars of society. And their children are now studying and playing here, who knows how much responsibility they will bear in the future!" He is like an old nurseryman, cultivating one batch of seedlings after another, year after year, always with hope. Among all the primary school teachers in the county, he is not the oldest in terms of age; but in terms of the number of years as a teacher, he is a veteran, because his students have become teachers, teachers teach students, and students become teachers again. And what about him? He is still teaching. He once expressed his attitude, "I will be a teacher until I can no longer teach." This spirit of wholeheartedly taking responsibility for the revolutionary descendants is a constant encouragement to all primary school teachers.
　　Old Mr. Lian is very familiar with multi-grade teaching. Even in the guerrilla environment and during the production to overcome the famine, the children's enrollment and progress were always very orderly. Even the young students wearing open-crotch pants (locally called "half-year grade") do not disrupt the order of the classroom. They say: "Old Mr. Lian tells good stories and has a lot of sheep to graze (the first lesson of the elementary grade is 'Little San Grazes Sheep'), there are goats, sheep, rams, ewes, and lambs... 'Eating peaches for writing well' – using a red pen to draw peach shapes when grading handwriting." He pays close attention to tutoring the children. Every night, he puts on a pair of old glasses and looks at the children's homework under the light of a vegetable oil lamp until late at night. Early the next morning, you can hear him running from the front yard to the back yard, waking up the sleepy children. There was such a thing: an old man from the mountain gully carried millet on his back to send his child, Wen Shuanggou, to school. This eleven-year-old child started learning from the first grade, and in less than a year and a half, he was promoted to the fourth grade. Why so fast? Of course, no one can match the child's own efforts, but Old Mr. Lian put a lot of effort into helping him. He first taught him to recognize his own name, the names of his family and people in the village, and common things, and cultivated his ability to manage the kitchen, practice mental arithmetic, written arithmetic, and conversion of weights and measures using an abacus. This method of combining learning with application made progress very quickly. The old man happily said: "Our mountain 'stone' can talk, I will sell two mu of land, and I will make sure my Shuanggou finishes school!"
　　Siping Village is close to the Zhang River. In the summer, the river water rises and falls unpredictably. Parents are afraid that the children will have accidents playing in the water, so they entrust Old Mr. Lian to take extra care of them. Before lunch, Old Mr. Lian often stood at the intersection, watching the team of students leaving school, each returning to their own home. After lunch, he often walked back and forth on the river bank to see if there were any children secretly playing in the water. Once, the children raised objections to this kind of supervision, saying that it is very hygienic to take a bath in hot weather, why don't you let us go? So Old Mr. Lian took this group of children to take a bath together. The children happily called him "Old Children's Head." There was a child king known as "Truant Ghost," Wang Xiaoqing, who often slipped out during half of the class, once on the pretext of urinating. In the past, Old Mr. Lian would have used a little "punishment" for this kind of naughty child. At that time, he still believed that "beating is affection, scolding is love." But after the War of Resistance Against Japan, he gradually changed this view. Just like dealing with this truant child: he went through research and discussion with colleagues and students, and adopted a positive encouragement method. Starting from the performance of "The Story of Wang Xiaoqing's Truancy," as soon as he saw any good points, especially if he didn't skip school for a day, he would encourage him and praise him. If he came early, washed his face clean, and solved the problem correctly, he would give him enough points. Publicly announce his achievements, and everyone applauded to welcome his progress. Old Mr. Lian also touched his head and called him a good boy, he was extremely happy! Every time he did something well, he would go to the teacher to receive an award. Over time, Wang Xiaoqing forgot his habit of truancy.
　　In 1942, there was a famine in the Taihang Mountains, and many students dropped out of school. The school came up with many ways to save and produce to help students who dropped out halfway, and used work-study to take care of particularly difficult students. However, some parents still refused to let their children come. At that time, the school made a special resolution: that is, before the start of school, they would personally go to the students' homes to mobilize them. This practice of teachers going to the door to call students was something that Old Mr. Lian had never experienced. But for the sake of the children's learning, he, like other teachers, carried rice bags and went to the countryside with great confidence, going sixty or seventy miles away to mobilize students. The parents responded: "Studying is a good thing, and the school is still helping to find ways. If we don't go to school again, how can we be worthy of the teachers!" Students must participate in extracurricular production when they come to school, because otherwise, eating becomes a problem, let alone studying! But mobilizing production was not an easy task at the beginning. The first person in the whole school to pick up the first load of manure and walk out of the school gate was Old Mr. Lian, and the second load? It was his child, Lian Dingxiu (a senior high school student). Under his leadership and guidance, the school's production was very good, and the students' learning was somewhat guaranteed. The students said: "If there is a big election in the whole school, Teacher Lian will definitely be the first labor hero."
　　During the War of Resistance Against Japan, the enemy would sweep through the area two or three times a year, each time for more than twenty days. It was a regular and important matter for the school to empty its premises and clear the fields, especially to protect the lives of the children. As soon as war information came, Old Mr. Lian was always busy burying things with the children, covered in sweat. In emergencies, the children who did not have time to evacuate would move to the mountains together. At that time, we mostly participated in the work of the district and village command, and Old Mr. Lian had to take more responsibility for taking care of the children. And the children also felt that with him there, they were more courageous. On a night during the May 1942 sweep, thunder mixed with artillery fire, lightning seemed to tear open cracks in the sky, and strong winds rolled raindrops close to the cliffs. The children were a little scared. Old Mr. Lian slept near the edge of the cliff, letting the children hide inside, so everyone seemed to feel like they had a wall to lean on. The next day, he personally escorted two children from this side of the mountain to the other side, and found their parents. And what about Old Mr. Lian? His home was five miles away, and he often hid on a big mountain, but he was always with this group of children.
　　Old Mr. Lian is a model veteran teacher. He and the children he taught have been rewarded with government funds and commendations several times. On the "June 6th" Festival in 1946, the masses sent him a large plaque, which was hung on the door of Siping Primary School. When he was sick, many children ran five miles to his home to visit him and help him do some things. The county leaders also often gave him all kinds of comfort. Because he dedicated everything to the cause of education.

　　三十年老教师连得华
    皇甫瑾
    连得华先生，山西左权县箕山村人。三十年来，他一直活在儿童们的中间。他大部分时间，是在故县村、寺坪村（两村只隔一二里）教书。虽然也曾担任过当地的中心校长和高小副校长，但他仍然是喜欢教小孩们。五年前，他曾对我讲过，大意是这样的：“你看寺坪村出了多少抗日干部，当县委的、科长的、区长的，还有团长的……他们小时候也就在这里念书和玩耍，现在都已成梁成柱了。而他们的孩子，又在这里念书和玩耍，说不定将来他们要负多大的责任呢！”他活象一个苗圃老人一样，培植了前一批树苗，再培植后一批，年年如此，永远带着希望。在全县小学教员中，若论年纪，他还不是最老的；但在当教员的年限上，他却是一个老前辈，因为他的学生已成了先生，先生教学生，学生又当了先生了。而他呢？却依然是在教书。他曾表示过自己的态度，“当教员要到不能教书的时候为止。”这种全心全意为革命后代负责的精神，对于所有小学教员，经常是一种鼓励。
    老连先生对复式教学摸得很熟，虽在游击环境和生产渡荒中，孩子们的入学和进度，总是很整齐的。连穿没裆子裤的幼稚生（当地称为“半年级”），也不捣乱课堂的秩序。他们说：“老连先生讲的好听，放的羊多（初级头一课为‘小三放羊’），有山羊，绵羊，公羊，母羊，小羊羔……。‘写好字有桃子吃’——判习字用红笔画桃形。”对孩子们的补习，他抓的很紧，每天晚上，他戴起一架老花镜，在一盏菜油灯下看孩子们的作业，一直到夜深人静才罢。第二天一早，就又听他前院跑后院，叫起那贪睡的孩子。有这样一回事：山沟里有个老头子背着小米，送他的孩子文双狗来上学，这个十一岁的孩子，开头从一年级学起，不到一年半就升到四年级了。为什么这样快呢？当然孩子的自身努力是谁也赶不上的，但老连先生对他的帮助是很下功夫的。他首先从认自己的名字，家庭及庄里的人名和常见的事物教起，并培养他管理灶务，练习心算、笔算和珠算的斤两折合等。这种学用结合的方法，进步很快。乐的那个老头子说：“我们山里的‘石头’会说话啦，变（卖）上二亩地，也要叫俺双狗念到底哩！”
    寺坪村紧傍着漳河，夏天河水涨落不定，家长们怕孩子们玩水出乱子，就都托老连先生多多的费心照护。午饭前，老连先生常是站在十字街口，眼看着放学的孩子队伍过去，各人回到各人的家里。午饭后，又常在河岸上走来走去，看有没有偷着玩水的孩子。有一次，孩子们对这种看管的办法提了意见，说是热天里洗澡很讲卫生，为什么不叫我们去呢？于是老连先生就带着这伙孩子们，一同去洗澡。孩子们高兴的称他为“老孩子头”。有一个号称“逃学鬼”的孩子王小庆，常是上着半截课，一次小便就溜出去了。对这种顽皮的孩子，如果在往年，老连先生是要动一点“刑法”的。那时他还认为“打是亲，骂是爱”。可是在抗战以后，他就逐渐的改变了这种看法。就如处理这个逃学的孩子吧：他是经过了同事和同学们的研究讨论，采取了积极的鼓励办法。从编演“王小庆逃学的故事”开头，一见他有一点儿好处特别是一天没有逃学，就鼓励他，表扬他。来的早了，脸洗净了，算题算对了，就给他打个足够的分数。当众宣扬他的成绩，大家鼓掌欢迎他的进步。老连先生也摸摸他的头，叫一声好孩子，他真是快乐极了！每办好一件事，就找老师去领奖。这样久而久之，王小庆就忘掉那逃学习惯了。
    一九四二年，太行山闹灾荒，学生退学的不少。学校想了许多节约和生产的办法，帮助半途失学的学生，并以半工半读来照顾特别困难的学生。但是一些家长还是不肯让孩子来，那时学校作了一个特别的决议：就是在开学前，亲自到学生家里去动员。这种先生上门叫学生的作法，在老连先生的经验里是从来没有的。但他为了孩子们的学习，和其他教员一样很有信心的挎着米袋下了乡，到六七十里外去动员学生，家长们反映：“念书是好事，学校还替想办法，再不上学，怎能对得起老师们！”学生来校，必须参加课外生产，因不这样，吃饭就成了问题，还谈得上什么学习！可是开始动员生产，并不是一件容易的事。在全校里挑起第一担大粪走出校门的，就是老连先生，第二担呢？是他的孩子连定修（高一学生）。在他的带头和指导下，学校生产搞得很好，学生学习有了一些保证。同学们说：“如果全校来个大选举，连老师定是第一名劳动英雄。”
    抗战期间，敌人一年要扫荡两三次，每次总有二十多天。学校空室清野，特别是保护孩子们的生命安全，是一件经常而又重要的事。战争情报一来，老连先生总是冒着满头大汗，忙着和孩子们埋藏东西。紧急时，来不及疏散的孩子们，就一块转移到山里去。那时我们大都参加区村指挥部的工作，对孩子们的照顾，老连先生要负更多的责任。而孩子们也觉得有他在，就比较壮胆。四二年五月扫荡的一个夜间，雷声搅着炮声，闪电象把天空撕开了裂缝，大风卷着雨点扑近山崖来，孩子们都有点害怕了。老连先生自己睡在靠近崖口的地方，让孩子们躲在里边，这样大家似乎觉得有了靠墙。第二天，他亲自护送着两个孩子，从山的这边转移到山的那边，找到了他们的爹娘。而老连先生呢？他的家要离五里地，而且常常躲在一个大山上，然而他却总是和这伙孩子们在一块。
    老连先生是模范老教师，他和他教的孩子们，曾几次受过政府的资金和褒状。一九四六年“六六”节，群众送他一面大匾，挂在寺坪完小的门上。当他病了的时候，许多孩子们跑五里路到他家里去问候，并帮助他做好些事情。县领导上也常给予他多方面的安慰。因为他对教育事业，献出了他的一切。
