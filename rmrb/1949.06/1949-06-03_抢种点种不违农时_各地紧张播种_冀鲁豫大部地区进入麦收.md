Intensive Planting in Various Regions
Most Areas of Hebei, Shandong, and Henan Enter Wheat Harvest

[Report from this newspaper] The sowing work in the entire North China region has entered its final intense stage, and simultaneously, work on weeding, watering, replenishing seedlings, and protecting seedlings has begun. Since the CCP North China Bureau issued the "Instructions on Anti-Drought Production, Economy, and Famine Preparedness" on the 19th, party and government leading organs in various regions have paid great attention and have mobilized cadres to go to the countryside to lead and assist in a concentrated planting effort. Furthermore, since the second ten days of the month, varying amounts of rainfall have occurred in the entire Central Hebei, Eastern Hebei, Central Shanxi regions, and most of Southern Hebei, Chahar, and parts of Suiyuan-Mongolia, making the planting work even more intensive. The Taiyue, Taihang, and most areas of Hebei-Shandong-Henan regions continue to experience drought, and well-digging and canal-building continue for spot-planting. The cotton planting plans for Central Hebei, Southern Hebei, Hebei-Shandong-Henan, Eastern Hebei, and Chahar have been fully or mostly completed, and now there is a concentrated effort to plant peanuts. Central Hebei region has temporarily allocated a total of 1.22 million catties of local grain as loans for purchasing peanut seeds; before the rain, the 10th and 11th special districts and five counties in the 9th special district had planted over 387,000 mu, and after the rain, Xian County alone planted over 5,700 mu in one day in eight districts. Chahar Province initially made 850,000 catties of peanuts seeds as loan grain, and the province's 400,000 mu peanut planting plan has been largely completed. Peanut planting in Southern Hebei has also been basically completed. In Hebei-Shandong-Henan's Neihuang County, 90,000 mu of peanuts were planted in the first ten days of the month, reaching more than two-thirds of the original plan; the state-owned store had loaned 200,000 catties of seeds in the county. The cotton planting task in Taihang and Taiyue is relatively small and has been generally completed. Regarding the planting of other crops, according to existing reports, sorghum in Hebei-Shandong-Henan was finished planting at the beginning of the month, and millet was mostly planted in the middle of the month. The Pingxi Special District of Chahar Province has largely completed field planting, while the Yishui Special District is striving to complete all planting by June 5th. Qian'an in Eastern Hebei has completed planting on 667,000 mu of farmland, and Jin County in Central Hebei has completed planting on 380,000 mu of autumn land.

Because of the drought and strong winds in various regions before the rain, windstorms, hailstorms, and insect pests occurred in most areas of Hebei-Shandong-Henan and in several counties in Southern Hebei, Central Hebei, Taihang, and Chahar. Severe cold in the entire Central Shanxi region, northern Taiyue, and western Taihang once formed a frost disaster, causing damage to the emerged seedlings. Local governments have taken emergency measures, launched campaigns to eliminate insects, weed, water, replenish seedlings, and protect seedlings. The Taiyue Administrative Office has allocated 2 million shi each of seed grain and spring famine relief grain to handle the aftermath. Various regions have also issued calls for early weeding; hoeing has started on sorghum in Hebei-Shandong-Henan, and hoeing is widespread in Yangcheng, Taiyue, with two-thirds of the area already hoed.

[Hebei-Shandong-Henan Electric Report] Most areas of our Hebei-Shandong-Henan region are entering the wheat harvest in full swing. Since May 24th and 25th, wheat harvesting has begun successively in the 6th, 8th, 9th, 7th, 5th, and 2nd special districts. Only the 3rd special district needs another four or five days before harvesting because last year's heavy rain and flooding delayed planting. Currently, most of the early-maturing wheat in these areas has been brought to the threshing ground. Around the Hua County 7th district of the 4th prefectural committee, wheat harvesting is already over half complete, and it is estimated that it will be completed in three days. Around Liaocheng of the 6th prefectural committee, wheat harvesting began on the 26th. Near Puyang of the 8th prefectural committee, most of the wheat has already been harvested. Other areas generally estimate that the large-scale harvest will begin on June 2nd or 3rd. Before this, many areas have issued instructions on leading and protecting the wheat harvest. For example, each county of the 9th prefectural committee organized militia and self-defense forces to patrol and prevent sabotage by bandits and special agents; some districts and villages established public security committees and convened landlords, rich peasants, and vagrant elements after the settlement to speak in advance and formulate covenants to ensure the order of the wheat harvest. The Puyang County Party Committee, in its instructions on leading the wheat harvest, further proposed to effectively solve the labor and livestock difficulties of the masses, prevent sabotage by bandits and special agents, and solve the problems of preferential treatment for military dependents in harvesting, so the order of the wheat harvest is generally better. It is understood that many areas planted later last year, lacked rain this spring, and experienced a sudden cold snap in early April. Some wheat has also developed jaundice, and it is estimated that the wheat harvest will be reduced, but it is currently difficult to estimate specifically. In order to strengthen the leadership of the wheat harvest and complete the task of rush harvesting, the current administrative office, military region, and various special county and district organs are organizing forces to join in assisting the harvest.

　　抢种点种不违农时
  　各地紧张播种
  　冀鲁豫大部地区进入麦收
    【本报讯】华北全区播种工作已进入最后紧张阶段，同时开始展开锄苗、浇苗、补苗、保苗工作。自中共华北局十九日“抗旱生产节约备荒指示”发出后，各地党政领导机关已引起很大注意，纷纷动员干部下乡领导并帮助突击播种。加以下旬以来冀中、冀东、晋中全区及冀南、察哈尔大部，绥蒙一部先后降落大小不同的雨量，抢种工作更为紧张。太岳、太行及冀鲁豫大部地区仍呈旱象，则继续挖井修渠进行点种。冀中、冀南、冀鲁豫、冀东、察哈尔棉花播种计划已全部或大部完成，现正突击种花生。冀中全区暂开支地方粮共一百二十二万斤贷出购买花生种，雨前十、十一专区及九专区五个县已种三十八万七千余亩，雨后仅献县八个区一天即播种五千七百余亩。察哈尔月初曾作八十五万斤的花生种贷粮，全省四十万亩花生播种计划已大体完成。冀南花生播种亦已基本完成。冀鲁豫内黄一县上旬已种花生九万亩，达原计划三分之二以上，国营商店曾在该县贷种二十万斤。太行、太岳植棉任务较小，大体已经完成。其他作物的播种，据已有报导，冀鲁豫高粱月初种完，谷子中旬已播种大部。察省平西专区大部完成大田播种，易水专区则争取六月五日前全部完成。冀东迁安六十六万七千亩大田及冀中晋县三十八万亩秋地已全部下种。
    因雨前各地天旱风大，冀鲁豫大部及冀南、冀中、太行、察哈尔等若干县份曾发生风灾、雹灾与虫害，晋中全区、太岳北部、太行西部一度严寒形成冻灾，致使已出之禾苗遭受灾害，各地政府都曾采取紧急措施，发动灭虫及锄苗、浇苗、补苗、保苗运动，太岳行署已拨发种子粮及春荒救济粮各二百万石办理善后。各地并提出早锄的号召，冀鲁豫高粱已开始锄头遍，太岳阳城普遍下锄，二区已锄三分之二。
    【冀鲁豫电】我冀鲁豫大部地区紧张进入麦收。自五月二十四、五以来，六、八、九、七、五、二等七个专区麦收已先后开始。仅三专区因去年雨大水多，播种较晚，尚需四、五日后才能收割。目前这些地区早熟麦多已上场，四地委滑县七区一带收麦已经过半，估计三天即可收完。六地委聊城周围，二十六日麦收就已开始。八地委濮阳附近则已收完大部。其他地区估计一般将于六月二、三日展开大收。在此以前，不少地区都发出了领导麦收，保卫麦收指示。如九地委各县，组织民兵、自卫队打更巡逻，防止匪特破坏；有的区、村建立了治安委员会，并召集清算后的地主富农及流氓分子事先讲话，制订公约，以确保麦收秩序。濮县县委在领导麦收工作指示中，更提出切实解决群众劳畜困难，防止匪特破坏，解决优军代收等问题，因此，麦收秩序一般较好。据了解不少地区因去年播种较迟，今春缺雨，及四月上旬天气突寒，有的麦子又生黄疸，估计麦子要减收，现尚难具体估计。为加强麦收领导与完成抢收任务，现行署、军区，及各专县区机关，正组织力量投入助收。
