    [Taiyue Telegraph] In the three days of May 26th, 27th, and 28th, all counties in the Taiyue District experienced widespread rainfall, varying in intensity, with most of the rain in northern Yue penetrating the soil. Judging from the rainfall situation throughout the district, although the rainfall is insufficient in many areas, the drought has passed. The disaster-stricken areas such as northern Yue received timely rain and are making every effort to rush planting and reseeding. Reseeding will be completed by the end of May. Those who have dry-planted or spot-planted will now be able to sprout thanks to the rain. Currently, the summer harvest is approaching, and Jin, Gao, Yang, and other places are busy weeding.
    [Suimeng Telegraph] Rain fell in parts of southeastern Suiyuan. Zhuozi had two to three inches of rain, Jining more than two inches, and Xinghe, Fengzhen, and Longshengzhuang, eighty miles northeast of Fengzhen, all had about an inch of rain. The oats, millet, and 黍 that were dry-planted before the rain can now sprout thanks to this rain. According to experienced farmers, now is the season of "planting melons and beans around Little Fullness," and although this rain is insufficient, it is not too late to rush-plant small millet and small 黍 that will yield a harvest in sixty days. Farmers in the suburbs are rushing to plant.

　　太岳各县普遍落雨补种抢种加紧进行
  　绥东部分地区落雨
  　莜麦糜黍可捉苗
    【太岳电】五月二十六、二十七、二十八三天中，太岳区各县普遍落雨，大小不等，岳北等地多已下透。从全区下雨情形来看，虽然好多地区雨量不足，但旱象已经过去。岳北等受灾地区得了及时透雨，正在全力进行抢种补种，五月底即可补种完毕。各地已经干种、点种的，得雨正好出苗。目前夏收快要到来，晋、高、阳等地又正忙着锄苗。
    【绥蒙电】绥东部分地区落雨，卓资由落雨两三寸，集宁二寸多，兴和、丰镇及丰镇东北八十里之隆盛庄均落雨寸许。雨前干种上之莜麦、糜、黍，借此雨即可捉苗。据老农谈，现在正是“小满前后种瓜点豆”的气节，这场雨虽不足，抢种上六十天还仓之小糜、小黍等尚未为晚。四郊农民正在抢种。
