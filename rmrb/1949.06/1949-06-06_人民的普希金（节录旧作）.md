　　The People's Pushkin (Excerpt from Old Works)
    Guo Kangke
    As a poet and writer, Pushkin is the founder of modern Russian literature. His position in Russian literary history is similar to that of Dante in Italy, Shakespeare in England, and Goethe in Germany. Like these brilliant names, he is not only a great Russian poet, but also transcends national boundaries.
    His achievements are grand and extensive. He wrote poetry, novels, plays, and historical studies. His achievements in all aspects are not only numerous but also excellent. He is a famous and versatile author. His writing attitude is very rigorous. The manuscript has to be revised four or five times, and he is not willing to be perfunctory at all. But once it is written, even the Tsar's order to change it cannot be obeyed. The style of his works is unusually fresh and elegant, with the pleasant leaps in Mozart's music and the vivid charm in Raphael's paintings. These are, of course, things worth learning from, but they are not solely obtained by his talent, but mainly by his efforts in life.
    In my opinion, there are several points about his attitude towards life that are particularly worth noting: first, his spirit of serving the people; second, his ambition to serve the revolution; and third, based on these two life principles, under the tyranny of the Tsar, he displayed the spirit of "cannot be corrupted by wealth, cannot be moved by poverty, and cannot be subdued by power."
    Although Pushkin was born into the nobility, his attitude towards life was first and foremost against the nobility. He was a friend of the people, standing on the people's position, and sincerely serving the people with the weapon of literature and art. He used the language of the people, and used folk legends and stories related to the people's liberation in history as his creative tools and materials to promote the liberation of the people. Therefore, in Pushkin's creation, he revived the Russian people's consciousness, the Russian language, and the entire Russian history. Lunacharsky said: "In the heart of the aristocratic Pushkin, what awakened was not the aristocratic class, but the necessity of the people, the country, the language, and history." This is the most correct understanding of Pushkin, and it is also the essence of Pushkin. To understand Pushkin, we must understand this Pushkin of the people. This people-oriented spirit is the first thing worth learning from us.
    Pushkin was certainly not a professional revolutionary, but in the promotion of the Russian revolution, in the liberation of serfs, and in the emergence of modern Russia to overthrow the Tsarist regime, he himself and his works played a great role. Based on the position of serving the people, he was of course a friend of the revolution and served the revolutionary cause. He was monitored by the Tsarist government for his rebellious ideas, lived in exile, and suffered all kinds of persecution, but he always stood on the side of the revolutionary ranks. There is such a story worth telling:
    On December 14, 1825, there was a Decembrist revolt in St. Petersburg. The partisans incited soldiers in the Senate Square to oppose the newly enthroned Nicholas I and demanded his abdication. Nicholas I used force to suppress the incident. Five leaders were hanged, and more than 120 people were exiled to Siberia. At that time, Pushkin was being held under house arrest in his hometown of Mikhailovskoye village, under surveillance. But in September of the following year, Tsar Nicholas I wanted to show some benevolence to win over the people. He ordered people to send Pushkin from Mikhailovskoye village to Moscow overnight, just like delivering a prisoner. The Tsar generously accepted him and declared that he had been pardoned. At that time, the Tsar asked him: "If you were in St. Petersburg last December, would you have participated in the Decembrist incident?" Pushkin replied very frankly. He said: "Your Majesty, without a doubt, I would have participated, because all my friends are in the rebel camp." Doesn't such an interjection show Pushkin's revolutionary spirit? Pushkin's revolutionary spirit is worth learning from us.
    Although Pushkin was a nobleman, his family was in decline. Especially after he got married, his wife, Natalya Goncharova, was a social butterfly who only cared about her appearances in social circles and did not care about Pushkin's life or death. Pushkin was burdened with debts for his wife and relied on writing to repay them. He was sometimes forced to a dead end, but he never changed his integrity because of poverty.
    His wife, Natalya Goncharova, was a beauty, and Nicholas I also liked her. In order to be able to be close to her often and to let her participate in balls in the court, he awarded Pushkin a small official position, which was a court chamberlain. If this were to fall into the hands of some despicable writers who flattered the powerful, even being a small "pawn" would make them feel flattered, but Pushkin regarded this as a great shame.
    His life in St. Petersburg was under the double surveillance of the Tsar and the Chief of Gendarmes, Alexander von Benckendorff, and there was no freedom to write or publish at all. Pushkin's famous historical tragedy "Boris Godunov" was intended to be published and sent to Nicholas I for personal review. That true "stupid emperor" misunderstood other people's tragedies as comedies and issued a handwritten order, asking Pushkin to change it into a historical novel or story in the style of Walter Scott. Pushkin flatly refused. He said: "He does not want to change what he has already written, and he cannot but express regret about this matter."
    Such a person with rebellious ideas would of course not be allowed to exist peacefully under Tsarist politics. A conspiracy to kill with a borrowed knife occurred under connivance, concealment, and even secret encouragement. A French royalist named Georges d'Anthès fled to Russia. The Tsar appointed him as an officer in the Horse Guards. D'Anthès was also adopted by the Dutch Minister Baron van Heeckeren. D'Anthès fell in love with Pushkin's wife. In addition, someone wrote anonymous letters to ridicule Pushkin. This angered Pushkin, and he finally threw the gauntlet at D'Anthès, and was basely shot and killed by D'Anthès, a murderer.
    From our Eastern point of view, this matter may seem that Pushkin was too rash, but this is precisely Pushkin's Pushkin. Pushkin can be so self-important: he is the representative of the Russian people, the representative of Russian culture, and his humiliation is the humiliation of the Russian people and the humiliation of Russian culture, so he does not hesitate to mortgage his blood and life to regain the reputation of the Russian people and Russian culture. Although he was basely assassinated and died, did he really die? What died was Pushkin's body, and what lived forever was the Russian people's culture and the Russian spirit represented by Pushkin.
    Because of Pushkin's death, the Russian people did wake up from thousands of years of sleep. Countless young students, workers, farmers, and petty citizens were concerned about Pushkin's injury and grieved for his death. A total of 30,000 to 40,000 people attended his funeral. This was the first collective action expressed by the Russian people. This action shocked the Tsar. He originally did not attach importance to the incident. D'Anthès had been declared innocent, but seeing the power of the masses, it was difficult to violate public anger, and he was forced to dismiss D'Anthès and expel him from the country. The Dutch Minister Baron van Heeckeren was also dismissed and recalled by his country's government. In this way, let us see, has Pushkin died? Pushkin is never dead.

　　人民的普希金（节录旧作）
    郭康可
    作为诗人，作为文艺作家，普希金是俄罗斯近代文学的开山，他在俄国文学史上的地位类似意大利的但丁，英国的莎士比亚，德国的歌德。同这些光辉的名字一样，他也不单仅是俄国的大诗人，而是超越过国境了。
    他的成就宏大而且广泛，他写诗，写小说，写剧本，写历史研究，在各方面的成绩不仅多而且精。他是有名的博学多能的作者，他的写作的态度非常谨严，手稿要经过四五次的修改，一点也不肯苟且。但一经写定，就是沙皇的命令要叫他改变，也是不能听从的。他的作品的风格异常地清新俊逸，有莫札尔特小曲中愉快的跳跃，拉斐罗绘画中生动的气韵，这些当然是值得我们学习的东西，但这些并不是专靠他的天才得来，而是主要地是靠着他做人的努力。
    他的做人的态度，在我认为有几点特别值得我们注意：第一是他的为人民服务的精神；第二是他的为革命服务的志趣；第三是根据着这两种生活原则，在沙皇暴政之下，他发挥了“富贵不能淫，贫贱不能移，威武不能屈”的气概。
    普希金虽然是贵族出身，但他的生活态度首先就是反对贵族的。他是人民的朋友，站在人民本位的立场，以文艺的武器诚心诚意地替人民服务。他采用着人民的语言，利用着民间的传说和历史上于人民翻身有关的故事，作为他的创作工具和材料，以促进人民的解放。所以在普希金的创作中，他是把俄罗斯的人民意识，俄罗斯的语言，俄罗斯的历史，整个复活了。卢那恰尔斯基说过这样的话：“在贵族普希金的心中，觉醒了的并不是贵族阶级，而是人民，国家，语言，历史的必然性”。这是对于普布金的最正确的认识，也就是普希金的本质。我们要了解普希金，就要了解这人民的普希金。这种人民本位的精神是最先值得我们学习的。
    普希金当然并不是职业革命家，但他在俄国革命的推动上，在解放农奴，推翻沙皇政权的近代俄国的产生上，他本人和他的作品都起了很大的作用。根据着为人民服务的立场，他当然是革命的朋友，为革命事业而服务。他以他那叛逆的思想被沙皇政府监视，过流放生活，遭受种种的迫害，然而他始终是站在革命队伍的一边。有这样的一个故事值得我们叙述：
    一八二五年十二月十四日在彼得堡曾经有过一次十二月党人的叛变。党人们鼓动起士兵在元老院的广场反对新即位的尼古拉一世，要他退位。尼古拉一世用武力来把这件事镇压下去了。领导者五人受了绞刑，一百二十多个人充军到西伯利亚。那时候普希金正被软禁在他的故乡米哈伊洛夫斯克村，受着看管。但到第二年的九月沙皇尼古拉一世很想施点仁惠来笼络人民，他命人从米哈伊洛夫斯克村就象递解囚犯一样，把普希金星夜兼程地送到莫斯科。沙皇宽大的接受着他，宣称已经把他赦免了。那时沙皇问他：“假如去年十二月你在彼得堡，你是不是会参加十二月党人的事件”？普希金答应得很直率。他说：“陛下，无疑，我是一定会参加的，因为在造反的阵营里的都是我的朋友”。这样的一个插话，不正表示着普希金的革命精神吗？普希金的这种革命精神是值得我们学习的。
    普希金虽然是贵族，但他的家况很式微。特别在他结了婚之后，他的夫人拉泰利亚是一位交际花，只顾自己在社交场的出入，而不管普希金的死活。普希金就为了他的太太背了一身债，靠着写作来偿还，他有时是被逼得走头无路的，然而他不曾为了贫贱而改变节操。
    他的夫人拉泰利亚是一位美人，尼古拉一世也喜欢她。为了得以时常和她亲近，得以让她在宫庭里参加舞会，他赏赐了普希金一个小小的官职，便是宫庭近侍。这假如是落在一些攀龙附凤的卑鄙文人手里，就是做了一名小小的“卒子”都是要感觉着受宠若惊的，然而在普希金把这件事看成了莫大的耻辱。
    他在彼得堡的生活是受着沙皇和宪兵队长班肯多尔夫的双重监视，连写作和发表也没有丝毫的自由。普希金有名的历史悲剧“波里斯·戈都诺夫”，打算要出版，要送呈给尼古拉一世亲自审查，那位真是名实相符的“傻皇”，竟把别人的悲剧误解成喜剧，而下出一条手谕，要普希金仿照司各特的作风把它改变成历史小说或故事，普希金坦然地拒绝了。他说：“他并不想改变自己所已经写成的东西，对此事他不能不表示遗憾”。
    这样有叛逆思想的人，在沙皇政治之下当然是不会容许安然存在的。借刀杀人的阴谋便在纵容，掩饰，甚至暗中鼓励之下发生了。法国的一位保皇党，名叫丹特士，逃亡到俄国。沙皇任命他为骑兵近卫队的一个军官。这丹特士同时又被荷兰公使格克伦收为义子。丹特士和普希金夫人发生了恋爱。此外还有人写匿名信去嘲笑普希金。因此便把普希金激怒了，终于向丹特士投出了手套，而遭了丹特士杀人犯的卑鄙的枪杀。
    这事情照我们东方的观点上看来，或许会嫌普希金过于轻率吧，但这也正是普希金之为普希金。普希金尽可以有这样的自负：他是俄罗斯人民的代表，是俄罗斯文化的代表，他的受了侮辱，也就是俄罗斯人民受了侮辱，俄罗斯文化受了侮辱，故尔他不惜把自己的血和生命来做抵押，要把俄罗斯人民，俄罗斯文化的名誉争取回来。他虽然受了卑鄙的暗杀，死了，但他真是死了吗？死了的是普希金的身体，永远活着的是由普希金所代表着的俄罗斯的人民文化，俄罗斯的精神。
    由于普希金的死，俄罗斯人民的确是从几千年的睡眠当中醒来了。无数的青年学生、工人、农人、小市民，都关切着普希金的受伤，而悲痛着他的死。参加了他的葬仪的，一共有三四万人。这是俄罗斯人民第一次表示的集体行动。这行动却把沙皇震惊了。他起先本来是没有把事件重视的，丹特士已经被宣告无罪，然而看到了这群众的威力，众怒难犯，被逼得不能不把丹特士免职而驱逐出境。荷兰公使格克伦也被他本国的政府撤职召回了。就这样，我们请看，普希金是死了吗？普希金是永远没有死的。
