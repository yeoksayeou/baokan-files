Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, 2nd: Thanks to the stability of the Renminbi's value and the liberation of Shanghai, prices in Nanjing were stable and fell before the Dragon Boat Festival on May 31st. During the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang government, prices soared every time a festival approached. This year, before the Dragon Boat Festival, the price of early-season rice in Nanjing fell by 100 yuan per shi (unit of dry measure), while mid-season and late-season rice fell by 200 yuan and 300 yuan respectively. Cotton cloth fell by about 10%, Western medicine fell by 20%, and white printing paper fell by more than 300 yuan per ream. In the past, citizens called "celebrating the festival" "suffering a robbery", but this year, during the Dragon Boat Festival, the people of the city were smiling and joyfully celebrating the festival.

　　南京端午节物价均稳落
    【新华社南京二日电】由于人民币币值的稳固及上海的解放，五月三十一日端午节前夕南京物价平稳下跌。国民党反动政府统治时期，每临节日到来，都是物价飞涨。今年端午节前夕南京市上熟米每石却下降一百元，中熟米及次熟米下降二百元及三百元。纱布跌约一成，西药下跌二成，白报纸每令跌三百余元。从前市民称“过节”为“遭劫”，今年端午节日，全市人民却喜笑颜开，欢渡佳节。
