　　Changlu Salt Sales Increase Daily
  　Dagukou Publicly Operated Salt Fields' Production Exceeds Last Year

    [Tianjin News] The Tangda Salt Affairs Administration, under the Changlu Salt District, which manages the Tanggu, Dagu, Xinhe, and Denggu sub-districts, is experiencing excellent salt production and increasingly vibrant sales. The public and private salt fields in this salt district total 282, and as of June 15th, they have produced over 5.8 million dan of salt, approximately 83% of the total production for the entire last year. In particular, the Dagukou publicly operated salt fields, due to the implementation of a surplus profit-sharing system, have seen a significant increase in the enthusiasm of the salt workers, and current salt production has already exceeded the total production of last year by 5%. Regarding sales, from the liberation to June 17th, the Tangda Salt Affairs Administration has sold a total of over 2 million dan (including 1.1 million dan of edible salt and 730,000 dan of industrial salt). A batch of salt for export will also soon be sold. With the liberation of the vast areas of Jiangnan, the demand for salt is very high, so sales will become even more prosperous.

  　大沽公营滩产量已超过上年
    【天津讯】长芦盐区塘大盐务管理处所辖塘沽、大沽、新河、邓沽四分处，产盐情况良好，销路亦日趋畅旺。该盐区公私营盐滩共二八二付，截至六月十五日，已共产盐五百八十余万担，约为去年全年产量的百分之八十三；特别是大沽公营滩地，由于实行了超额分红制，滩工生产情绪大为提高，目前产盐已超过去年全年产量的百分之五，销路方面，自解放后至六月十七日，塘大盐务管理处已共售出二百余万担（其中包括食盐一百一十万担，工业用盐七十三万担），最近并将有一批外销盐成交，而江南广大地区解放后，需盐甚多，故销路将益形畅旺。
