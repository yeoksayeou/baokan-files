Xinhua News Agency, Peiping, June 21st: TASS, Moscow: Pravda recently published a dispatch from its Berlin correspondent, Korolkov, entitled "Provocation on the Berlin Railway," discussing the so-called "strike" on the West Berlin railway that has been going on for nearly a month. It states: This spring, the separatist municipal government of West Berlin, following the orders of the Western occupying authorities, passed a resolution stipulating that food stores in West Berlin were prohibited from accepting German Marks issued by the Soviet-occupied zone of Germany. Rent and other public utility payments could only be made using West Zone Marks. This provocative order placed the municipal railway employees, who received wages in East Zone Marks, in a difficult situation. Later, the railway administration, under the control of the Soviet authorities, reached an agreement with the West Zone authorities, according to which all West Zone Marks from municipal railway revenue were to be transferred to the West Zone municipal government, which, in turn, would convert a portion of the railway workers' wages into West Zone Marks. In addition, the administration opened special food stores for West Berlin railway employees at various stations, allowing them to purchase food at these stores using East Zone Marks. However, as early as May, the Western occupying authorities closed all railway stores. On the other hand, the West Zone municipal government violated the agreement and stopped exchanging West Zone Marks for the municipal railway employees. At the same time, it directed the "trade union opposition," formed under the instructions of the American authorities, to forcefully demand that the railway administration pay all wages in West Zone Marks, launching a so-called "strike" on May 21st. However, the organizers of the provocation suffered a complete failure. They couldn't even feign the appearance of a mass movement. Therefore, the organizers of the provocation used other means. They gathered gangs of criminals, speculators, shopkeepers, and fascists, people who had no connection with the railway employees, to carry out sabotage activities. On the first day of the "strike," American Commander Howley hastily announced on the radio that he "supported the strikers." Thus, the thugs received the open protection of the American authorities. Korolkov cited many facts to definitively prove that officials of the Western occupying authorities participated in the railway provocation. The bandits portrayed these circumstances in Berlin as a "strike." On May 31st, the municipal railway administration and the railway union of the Federation of Free German Trade Unions reached an agreement on paying 60% of the wages of railway employees residing in West Berlin in West Zone Marks. Therefore, the formal reason for continuing the "strike" no longer existed. However, the organizers of the provocation did not cease and continued to obstruct the restoration of railway order. The provocateurs of the "independent trade union opposition" and their Anglo-American instigators were completely unconcerned about the reopening of railway traffic. They spared no effort to obstruct the agreement on reopening transport and traffic between Berlin and the Western occupied zones. They wanted to force the railway administration to negotiate with the notorious "opposition," which would mean recognizing this illegal separatist organization in Berlin. Korolkov wrote in conclusion: As a result of this abnormal situation, the Soviet Military Commander of Berlin, Kotikov, pointed out at the Berlin Commanders' meeting on June 3rd that the commanders of the Western zones must remove the West German police from the stations, enterprises, and railway facilities, protect the railway from sabotage activities, and enable the railway administration to perform its duties.

    柏林铁路上的挑衅
    真理报柏林记者通讯
    【新华社北平二十一日电】塔斯社莫斯科讯：真理报顷刊载其驻柏林特派记者柯罗尔科夫的题为“柏林铁路上的挑衅”的通讯，论述持续将近一月的西柏林铁路的所谓“罢工”称：今年春天，西柏林分裂者的市政府依照西部占领当局的命令，通过一项决定，规定西柏林的食品商店禁止接受德国苏占区发行的德国马克。房租及其他公用事业的支付也只能使用西区马克。这种挑拨性的命令使以东区马克领取工资的市境铁路员工陷于困境。后来，苏当局控制下的铁路管理局与西区当局达到了协议，根据该协议，所有市境铁路收入的西区马克，都转交给西区市政府，而后者应将部分铁路人员工资兑换西区马克。此外，管理局为西柏林铁路员工在各车站开办了专用食品商店，使铁路员工能用东区马克在上述商店购买食品。然而早在五月间，西方占领当局就封闭了所有铁路商店。另一方面，西区市政府违背协议，停止给市境铁路员工兑换西区马克，同时，它又指使奉美国当局指令组成的“职工会反对派”，强词要求铁路管理局以西区马克发放全部工资而于五月二十一日发动所谓“罢工”。然而挑衅的组织者遭到了完全失败。他们甚至连群众运动的样子都装不象。于是，挑拨的组织者又使用了另外的手段。他们纠合了成帮的犯人、投机者、店主与法西斯党徒，这些和铁路员工毫无关系的人，来进行捣乱活动，在“罢工”的第一天，美国司令官霍利急忙以广播宣布，他“支持罢工者”。因此，暴徒们得到了美国当局的公开维护。柯罗尔科夫引证了许多事实，确切地证明西部占领当局的官员们参加了铁路挑拨活动。匪徒们将柏林的这些情况说成“罢工”。五月三十一日，市境铁路管理局与自由德国职工会联合会的铁路工会，获致了关于居住柏林西区铁路职工工资的百分之六十以西区马克支付的协议。因此，继续“罢工”的正式理由就不再存在。然而挑拨的组织者并未罢休，且继续阻挠铁路秩序的恢复。“独立的职工会反对派”的挑拨者及其英美煽动者完全不关心铁路交的通重开。他们不惜尽一切努力，以阻挠对重开柏林与西部占领区的运输和交通达到协议。他们想迫使铁路管理局与臭名昭著的“反对派”从事谈判，这就是意味着承认这个在柏林的非法的分裂者的组织。柯罗尔科夫在结语中写道：由于这种不正常情形而引起的结果。柏林苏军司令官柯提柯夫已在六月三日柏林各司令的会议上指出：西区各司令官必须撤除车站、企业及铁路附属机构中的西德警察，保护铁路免受破坏活动，使铁路管理局有可能执行其职务。
