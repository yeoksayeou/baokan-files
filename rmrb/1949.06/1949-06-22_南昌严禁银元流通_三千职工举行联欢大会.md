Xinhua News Agency, Nanchang, 21st: To protect the interests of the people and prevent speculators from manipulating and disrupting the market, the Nanchang Military Control Commission and the Municipal Government have issued an order effective from the 18th, strictly prohibiting the circulation of silver dollars and copper coins in the market. Workers, students, and cadres from various municipal organs have organized propaganda teams to conduct street campaigns. The Municipal Public Security Bureau has also dispatched detective teams to penetrate the market and investigate speculators engaged in black market activities involving silver dollars. Those who are primarily responsible for disrupting the financial system will be severely punished once caught.

Xinhua News Agency, Nanchang, 21st: The Nanchang Military Control Commission convened a get-together for more than three thousand employees from railway, highway, postal, shipping, and utilities departments on the 30th. The Director and Deputy Directors of the Military Control Commission, the Mayor, the Deputy Commander of the Garrison, and other military and government leaders attended and delivered speeches. Chen Zhengren, Director of the Military Control Commission, pointed out: This is a grand gathering for the Chinese Communist Party and the People's Liberation Army to reunite with the working class of Jiangxi after a long and arduous struggle to return to Jiangxi. He called on all employees to inherit the revolutionary spirit of the past and work hard to build a new Jiangxi. Chen Qihan, Deputy Director of the Military Control Commission, said: In recent decades, although the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China was far away in the north, it was always concerned about the worker brothers in the south. Employee representatives expressed in their speeches that they would work hard to increase production and support the front lines in order to swiftly and thoroughly eliminate the remnant forces of the Kuomintang bandits.
