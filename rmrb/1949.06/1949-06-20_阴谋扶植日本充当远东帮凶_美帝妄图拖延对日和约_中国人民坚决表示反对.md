Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 19th. This reporter learned from people familiar with the Japanese situation that the United States has decided to indefinitely delay a peace treaty with Japan in order to fully foster Japan as its accomplice in aggression in the Far East. It is reported that Vanne (FINE), head of the expert group of MacArthur Headquarters, sent a statement to the US State Department on the 4th of this month, explaining MacArthur's American policy in Japan. The statement admitted that "the China Incident" proved that the imperialist policy implemented by the United States in Asia has gone bankrupt, and emphasized that under the conditions currently formed, "Japan should play the role of the main ally of the United States in the Far East." To this end, the statement reiterated that "the occupation of Japan should be extended as much as possible," once again revealing the United States' determination to delay the signing of a peace treaty with Japan for a long time.

The people of Asian countries, especially the Chinese people, have exposed and resolutely opposed this long-planned conspiracy of the American imperialists more than once. When the US government made the illegal decision to separately convene a unilateral preliminary meeting on the peace treaty with Japan in July 1947, Chinese public opinion widely condemned it. This reporter published a commentary on September 3, denouncing the US decision as a conspiracy to "attempt to overthrow the Four-Power Agreement, thereby monopolizing Japan, and then indulge Japan in invading China and harming the Far East." It also firmly advocated that the preliminary meeting on the peace treaty with Japan and the drafting of the peace treaty with Japan must be based on the principle that the drafting of the peace treaty with defeated countries should first be agreed upon by the major powers, as stipulated in previous international conferences. On January 21, 1948, this agency had already quoted solid evidence to reveal that MacArthur had suggested to the former US Secretary of State Marshall that the United States "must extend the time of occupation of Japan, and for this purpose, it must delay the signing of a peace treaty with Japan under various pretexts." In the recommendation, MacArthur believed that the United States must maintain naval and air force bases in Japan, China, and Korea in order to consolidate the United States' position in the Far East. Vanne's statement shows that although the United States' aggressive policy in China has completely failed, the American aggressors have not learned the lessons they deserve from this fact.

### 阴谋扶植日本充当远东帮凶　美帝妄图拖延对日和约  中国人民坚决表示反对

　　阴谋扶植日本充当远东帮凶
  　美帝妄图拖延对日和约
    中国人民坚决表示反对
    【新华社上海十九日电】本社记者自熟悉日本情况的人士获悉，美国决定无限期拖延对日和约以图全力扶植日本充当起在远东的侵略帮凶。据悉，麦克阿瑟总部的专家团团长范恩（ＦＩＮＥ），于本月四日曾向美国务院致送说明书一件，为麦克阿瑟的美国在日政策进行解释。该说明书承认：“中国事变”证明美国在亚洲实行的帝国主义政策业已破产，并强调指出在目前形成的条件下，“日本在远东应起美国主要同盟者的作用”。为此，该说明书重又主张“占领日本期限应尽量延长”，再次表露了美国长期拖延签订对日和约的决心。
    美国帝国主义者的这一蓄意已久的阴谋企图，亚洲各国人民尤其是中国人民，早已不止一次地予以揭露并表示坚决反对。当美国政府于一九四七年七月作出单独召开片面的对日和约初步会议的非法决定后，中国舆论界曾广泛的加以谴责。本社记者于九月三日发表评论，指斥美国这一决定，是“企图推翻四强协议，借以独占日本，进而放纵日本侵略中国为祸远东”的阴谋。并坚主召开对日和约的初步会议和草拟对日和约，必须根据历次国际会议规定对战败国草拟和约，应首经强国一致协议的原则。一九四八年一月二十一日，本社即已引用确实证据，揭露麦克阿瑟曾向前美国国务卿马歇尔建议美国“必须延长占领日本的时间，为此并须在各种借口下拖延签订对日和约”。麦克阿瑟在建议书中认为美国在日本、中国和朝鲜必须保有海空军基地，这样才能巩固美国在远东的地位。范恩的说明书，表明美国在中国的侵略政策虽已完全破产，但美国侵略分子还没有从这个事实取得应有的教训。
