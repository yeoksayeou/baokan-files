North China's May Agricultural Situation

　　Continue Fighting Drought and Planting
　　Struggle Against Disasters
　　Wheat Harvesting and Replanting with Seedling Protection Closely Integrated

[This Newspaper's Report] Seizing the planting season, continuing the intensive planting efforts, and mobilizing all forces to fight against natural disasters and insect pests are the most urgent tasks in North China's agricultural production in May. Since the beginning of May, rainfall in various areas has been scarce, with most areas experiencing drought. Only after mid-May did widespread rain fall across the region, except for some counties in Hebei, Shandong, Henan, and individual areas. This relieved a major difficulty in drought prevention and planting across the region. In the face of prolonged drought, the masses in various regions did not succumb to difficulties. On the contrary, they displayed the determination of "man can conquer nature," and launched various forms of planting campaigns everywhere, such as digging wells, opening canals, organizing waterwheels, and transporting water for irrigation. According to incomplete statistics from various regions, more than 100,000 earthen wells were dug throughout the region, 4,628 brick wells were built, 7,887 new waterwheels were added, 6,724 old waterwheels were repaired, and 350 new large and small canals were opened, ensuring early planting on 300,000 mu of land. As of May 23rd, approximately 70% to 80% of upland crops (millet, sorghum, etc.) had been planted across the region. Cotton planting in various districts: In early May in southern Hebei, according to statistics from counties in the first, second, and third districts, two-thirds of the planting plan had been realized. It is estimated that the entire region may complete 80% of the task of planting 6 million mu of cotton fields. The task of planting 2.5 million mu of cotton in central Hebei, according to reports on May 20th, had seen over 1.8 million mu planted in the eighth, ninth, and tenth districts. It is estimated that the entire region can complete about 80% of the total task by the end of the month. For the Taihang area's plan to plant 1 million mu of cotton, current statistics from only 18 counties in the first, fourth, and fifth districts show that 789,000 mu have been completed, accounting for more than 78% of the total task for the region. The cotton fields in this area may be able to complete the entire task. In the Taiyue area, before May 21st, according to counties under the second and third districts, 200,000 mu had been completed, accounting for more than 58% of the 350,000 mu planned for cotton planting this year in the region. If the number of cotton planted in Lingshi and other counties in the first district is added, the task for this area can be fully completed. 760,000 mu of cotton were planted in eastern Hebei (originally planned for 1 million mu). It is estimated that Chahar Province can also complete the task. Judging from the above situation, there is no difficulty in striving for the full planting of upland crops, as most areas had thorough rain in the latter part of the month. According to a rough estimate by the Agricultural Department of the North China Government, about 80% of the total task of planting 13 million mu of cotton fields can be completed across the region. Various regions are now beginning to summarize.

Fighting against wind, drought, hail, frost, and the continuous occurrence of insect plagues is an arduous task for leaders at all levels and all the people in the North China region. Judging from the current situation, this struggle has been successful. In May, 34 counties newly experienced insect plagues. Leaders in various regions have paid attention to organizing forces to eliminate them in a timely manner. For example, when locust nymphs were discovered in Anyang County, Taihang, a locust extermination headquarters was immediately established, and 24 cadres were sent to lead the locust extermination. After insect plagues occurred in central and eastern Hebei, insect extermination headquarters were generally established, and a large number of cadres and agricultural technicians were organized to intensively eliminate insects. After insect pests occurred in the fruit trees of Chahar Province, the provincial government immediately sent personnel to the disaster area to lead the masses in catching and killing them. In particular, the technology promotion team used sprayers and pesticides to eliminate many pests, thereby laying the foundation for the masses to believe in scientific methods of pest control. In addition to organizing pest control teams to go to the countryside, the Agricultural Department of the North China People's Government has also distributed 140,000 jin of pesticides and 1,700 sprayers to various regions. If combined with the existing medicines and equipment in various regions, it is estimated that it will be sufficient to prevent and control insect pests on 1 million mu of land. Various regions are now seizing the work of capturing and killing them. In addition, more than 20 counties in Taihang, Taiyue, Jinzhong, and other places experienced frost damage on May 13th and 14th. For example, in counties such as Qinyuan and Anze, the river water froze to two fingers thick, and the autumn seedlings that had just emerged from the soil were frozen to death again. Hail damage occurred in more than 30 counties in Jinzhong, Hebei-Shandong-Henan, and Chahar regions, with Jinzhong being the most severely affected. For example, in Wenshui and Jiaocheng counties in the second district, hailstones were about two inches in diameter, and the autumn seedlings suffered considerable damage. After the disaster occurred, the leading organs in various regions immediately encouraged the local people's confidence, solved specific difficulties, and mobilized the masses to replant. For example, the Taiyue Administrative Office allocated 2 million dan of seeds and spring relief grain. The current situation is that the reduction in wheat harvest is a foregone conclusion (estimated to be about 40% in Hebei-Shandong-Henan). Although the autumn seedlings have been damaged by frost, hail, and insects, they can still be saved through replanting. The military and civilians of the entire region are unanimously mobilizing to make a sustained struggle to overcome disasters. Now that the spring planting season is coming to an end and the wheat harvest season has arrived, various regions must pay attention to closely combining the work of protecting seedlings, weeding, eliminating insect pests, and preventing natural disasters with the wheat harvest during this tense season. It is necessary to harvest wheat on the one hand, and mobilize all forces to thoroughly eliminate insect pests in insect-plagued areas; in hail-stricken, frost-stricken, and severely drought-stricken areas, carry out replanting and seedling protection. Leaders should prevent phenomena such as attending to one thing and losing sight of another, and fatigue and complacency. Secondly, after a long drought, there will inevitably be heavy floods. This is a rule that has been repeatedly verified over the years. Various regions must also pay attention to combining drought resistance and replanting with flood prevention work. Otherwise, it will be too late to build dikes after the water comes. This point should attract the close attention of leading organs in various regions.

### 华北五月农情　继续抗旱点种　与灾害作斗争  麦收与补种保苗密切结合

　　华北五月农情
  　继续抗旱点种
  　与灾害作斗争
    麦收与补种保苗密切结合
    【本报讯】抓紧播种季节，继续突击点种，动员一切力量与天灾虫害作斗争，是华北五月份农业生产上最紧张的任务。五月上旬以来，各地雨量缺少，一般地区均呈旱象，直到中旬以后，除冀鲁豫及个别地区部分县份外，全区普遍落雨，由此就给全区防旱点种解除了一大困难。在久旱不雨的情况下，各地群众并未在困难面前屈服，相反的却以“人定胜天”的毅力，到处开展着挖井开渠、组织水车、运水浇种……等各种形式的播种热潮。据各地不完全统计，全区打土井十万眼以上，垒砖井计四千六百二十八眼，增新水车七千八百八十七辆，修旧水车六千七百二十四辆，新开大、小渠达三百五十道，保证了三十万亩土地的提早下种。全区各地截至五月二十三日止，播种大田作物（谷、高粱等）约百分之七十至八十。棉田在各区的播种：冀南在本月上旬据一、二、三专区各县的统计，已实现种植计划的三分之二，全区估计可能完成六百万亩棉田任务的百分之八十。冀中二百五十万亩的植棉任务，据五月二十日的报导，八、九、十专区已植棉一百八十余万亩，估计全区月底可完成总任务百分之八十左右。太行植棉一百万亩的计划，现仅一、四、五专区十八个县统计，已完成七十八万九千亩，约占全区总任务百分之七十八以上。该区棉田可能全部完成任务。太岳区在五月二十一日前，据二、三专区所属各县，已完成二十万亩，约占该区今年植棉三十五万亩的百分之五十八以上，如果再加一专灵石等县已植棉数，该区任务将可全部完成。冀东棉花播种七十六万亩（原计划一百万亩）。察省估计也可完成任务。从以上情况观之，大田作物由于下旬大部地区落透雨，争取全部下种尚无困难，棉田播种据华北政府农业部的概略估计，全区约可完成总任务一千三百万亩的百分之八十。现各地正在着手总结中。
    与风、旱、雹、冻及连续发生之虫灾作斗争，为华北区各级领导及全体人民之繁重任务。从目前已了解的情况讲，这一斗争是有成绩的。在五月份内新发生虫害的县份计有三十四县，各地领导上都曾注意及时组织力量消灭。如太行安阳县发现蝗蝻，即马上成立剿蝗指挥部，派出二十四个干部领导剿蝗。冀中、冀东发生虫灾后，普遍成立灭虫指挥部，并大批组织干部和农业技术人员突击除虫。察省果树发生虫害后，省府立即派员赴灾区领导群众捕灭，特别是技术推广组用喷雾器、农药，消灭很多害虫，由此打下了群众相信科学办法除虫的基础。华北人民政府农业部除一面组织防虫队下乡外，且已分配各地十四万斤农药，一千七百架喷雾器，若连各地共有药械，估计足可防治一百万亩土地的虫害，现各地正抓紧捕灭工作。另外，太行、太岳、晋中等地共有二十余县在五月十三、十四，发生冻、霜灾，如沁源、安泽等县，河水结冰二指，方出土之秋苗，又被冻死，雹灾在晋中、冀鲁豫、察哈尔等区约计三十余县，受灾以晋中最严重，如二专区之文水、交城等县落冰雹二寸许秋苗受损颇大。各地领导机关在灾情产生后，即马上鼓舞当地人民信心，解决具体困难，动员群众补种。如太岳行署拨种子及春荒粮各二百万石。目前的情况是麦收减产已成定局（冀鲁豫的统计约为四成），秋苗虽经冻、雹、虫为害，但经补种尚可挽救，全区军民正一致动员为战胜灾害作持续的斗争。现春田播种季节即将过去，麦收季节已到，因此，各地必须注意在这紧张季节里，把保苗、锄苗、除灭虫害、预防天灾的工作与麦收密切结合，要做到一面收麦，一面动员全力在虫灾地区，彻底消灭虫灾；在雹、冻灾及旱象严重地区进行补种、保苗，领导上要防止顾此失彼和疲惫自满等现象。其次是久旱之后，必有大涝，这已是历年屡验不爽的规律，各地在抗旱补种中还须注意与防汛工作结合，否则，水来之后再筑堤就赶不上了。这一点，应引起各地领导机关的严密注意。
