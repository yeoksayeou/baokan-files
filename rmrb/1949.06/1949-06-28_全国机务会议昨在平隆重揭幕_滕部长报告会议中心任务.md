　　National Machinery Conference Grandly Opens in Beiping
 　 Minister Teng Reports on Central Tasks of the Conference
　　[Our Newspaper’s report] The first National Machinery Conference of the Military Commission's Ministry of Railways grandly opened in Beiping at 8:00 AM yesterday (the 27th). Two hundred and sixty representatives and model labor heroes from various regions attended, including representatives from the Northeast Railway General Bureau, and the Beiping-Tianjin, Taiyuan, Zhengzhou, Jinan, Wuhan, and Beijing-Shanghai Railway Administrations, as well as units directly under the Ministry of Railways such as the Changxindian and Tangshan locomotive factories. After Deputy Director Zhou Xiaoping of the Machinery Bureau announced the opening of the conference, Minister Teng delivered a report. He explained the purpose of convening the Machinery Conference, which is to summarize the experience of the responsibility system in machinery work, strengthen the organization and planning of machinery work, improve its efficiency, and further enhance the effectiveness of machinery work to ensure the smooth completion of the people's railway transportation tasks. He pointed out that the focus of this conference is:

　　Summarize the Experience of the Responsibility System
　　First, summarize the experience of the responsibility system in machinery work, especially the typical experience of locomotive crew contracting and repair in the Northeast Railway. After the implementation of the responsibility system in the Northeast, the Northeast Railway industry has made significant progress and achievements, overcoming the past chaos, backwardness, conservatism, low efficiency, and huge waste in machinery work, while improving locomotive quality, extending maintenance mileage, and enhancing traction capacity. More than thirty model locomotives emerged. Since the Beiping-Tianjin Bureau implemented the responsibility system in April, many model locomotives have also emerged. Therefore, we should summarize the experience of the responsibility system in machinery work in the Northeast, further study and implement the implementation of the responsibility system in the Beiping-Tianjin Bureau, and begin to fully establish it in the Jinan, Zhengzhou, and Taiyuan Bureaus. The southern bureaus should also begin to pilot it. Study the combination of the work of the crew and repair departments to improve locomotive quality and operational efficiency. Establish the banner of the crew responsibility system—with the "Mao Zedong," "Iron Ox," and "884" locomotives as the banners of model locomotives for the national railway. The General Bureau and each Railway Administration should cultivate their own banner. Study the steps and plans for promoting and implementing the responsibility system in national machinery work. Unify the establishment of the organizational system of the responsibility system. Ideologically understand the importance and essence of the responsibility system, and carry out mobilization and education work from top to bottom for comprehensive discussion and research.

　　Determine the Tasks for the Second Half of the Year
　　Second, determine the tasks and direction of efforts in machinery for the second half of the year. In the Northeast, not only should the 1949 tasks be completed, but it is also required to exceed the tasks. The requirements for the tasks of the northern bureaus are to formulate different task plans based on different situations. For the southern bureaus, the focus is on strengthening the consolidation of existing capabilities, ensuring the completion of military transport tasks, and implementing the responsibility system in conjunction with the actual situation. In order to ensure the completion of transport tasks, good research should be conducted on the four issues of daily locomotive mileage, technical speed, indexing capacity, and locomotive cycle efficiency, and standards and goals should be formulated realistically based on the actual situation. Improving the locomotive operation standards of crew members and increasing the training and learning of general maintenance techniques is also a very important task. Weak traction capacity and poor operating skills are a serious situation in the national machinery departments, and the technical standards of crew members must be rapidly improved.

　　Consolidate Organization, Improve Efficiency, Overcome Waste
　　Third, consolidate personnel organization, improve work efficiency, and overcome waste. At present, there is a large amount of waste of manpower and man-hours in various railway bureaus across the country, with too many people and too little work, which is a great burden on the people's railway. It should be well studied and overcome. Finally, Minister Teng earnestly hoped that the representatives from various regions would complete the tasks of this conference with a high sense of responsibility.

　　In addition to discussing and researching the responsibility system and task plan issues, the conference also plans to resolve the following specialized issues after the meeting: (1) Study and formulate locomotive scheduled inspection mileage standards and systems; (2) Study and formulate locomotive and passenger/freight car maintenance man-hours and standards; (3) Study and formulate national steam locomotive maintenance regulations; (4) Study and formulate national passenger/freight car maintenance regulations; (5) Study and formulate detailed rules for steam locomotive boiler washing; (6) Study and formulate locomotive water drainage systems and methods; (7) Provisional measures for locomotive emblem markings; (8) Steam locomotive history books and handling procedures; (9) Draft of work rules for locomotive dispatchers; (10) Vehicle marking logos; (11) Consolidate the personnel organization of the machinery inspection section, improve efficiency, overcome the waste of manpower and mechanical efficiency, and conduct planned allocation and training; (12) Study statistical regulations and methods; (13) Provisional measures for mechanical management, use, and maintenance regulations. The conference will last for ten days. Starting from the afternoon of the 27th, the Beiping-Tianjin, Zhengzhou, Taiyuan, Jinan, Beijing-Shanghai, Wuhan, and Northeast Railway Bureaus will each give reports on machinery work. Typical reports will begin on the afternoon of the 29th, and labor heroes from the Northeast, Beiping-Tianjin, and other bureaus will introduce their experiences. Group discussions will begin on July 1st to study the responsibility system and task plans. The conference will be adjourned on the 5th, and the closing summary is scheduled for July 6th.

　　全国机务会议昨在平隆重揭幕
  　滕部长报告会议中心任务
    【本报讯】军委铁道部第一次全国机务会议，于昨（二十七）日上午八时在平隆重揭幕，出席各地代表暨劳模英雄共二百六十人，包括东北铁路总局、平津、太原、郑州、济南、武汉、京沪各铁路管理局，及铁道部直属长辛店、唐山机厂等单位。机务局副局长周侠平宣布开会后，滕部长即作报告。他说明召开机务会议的目的，是为了总结机务工作中负责制的经验，并加强机务工作的组织性计划性及其效率，进一步发挥机务工作的效能，保证人民铁道运输任务的顺利完成。他指出：这次会议的中心是：
    总结负责制的经验
    第一、总结机务工作负责制的经验，特别是东北铁路机车包乘包修的典型经验。负责制在东北实行后，东北铁路事业就有着显著的进步和成效，克服了机务工作中过去纷乱、落后、保守、效力低落与浪费庞大的现象，同时提高了机车质量，延长检修走行公里，增强牵引能力，涌现了三十台以上的模范典型机车。平津局从四月份实行负责制以来，也涌现了不少模范典型机车，因此我们应该很好的总结东北机务工作中负责制经验，进一步研究和贯彻平津局负责制的实施，并在济南、郑州、太原三局开始全面建立起来。南方各局亦应开始试行。研究包乘、包修两个部门工作上的结合，以使机车质量和运用效能提高。树立乘务负责制的旗帜——以毛泽东号、铁牛号、八八四号，为全国铁道模范机车的旗帜。总局、各管理局均应培养自己的一个旗帜。研究全国机务工作推行和贯彻负责制的步骤和计划。统一建立负责制的组织制度。在思想上领会负责制度的重要性和精神实质，自上而下进行动员教育工作，全面的讨论研究。
    确定下半年度任务
    第二、确定下半年度机务方面的任务及努力方向。在东北方面不仅完成一九四九年的任务，并且要求超过任务。对于北方各局任务的要求，系根据不同的情况，制订不同的任务计划。对于南方各局则是加强现有能力的整理，保证军运任务的完成，结合实际情况，实行负责制，为了保证运输任务的完成，应在日车公里、技术速度、索引能力、机车循环效能四个问题上，很好的研究，根据实际情况，实事求是的制定标准和奋斗的目标。对于乘务人员机车操纵水准的提高及一般检修技术的增养学习，也是一件非常重要的工作，牵引能力弱，操纵技术不良，是全国机务部门一个严重情况，必须迅速提高乘务员技术水准。
    整理组织　提高效率　克服浪费
    第三、整理人事组织，提高工作效率，克服浪费的现象。目前全国各路局人力工时的浪费大量存在，人多事浮，对于人民铁路的负担很大，应该很好的加以研究和克服。最后滕部长殷切希望各地出席代表以高度的负责精神，来完成这次会议的任务。
    大会除讨论研究负责制及任务计划问题外，并准备在会后解决下列各专门问题：（一）研究和制订机车定检公里标准及制度；（二）研究和制订机车及客货车辆检修工时及标准；（三）研究和制订全国蒸汽车辆检修保养规程；（四）研究和制订全国客货车辆检修保养规程；（五）研究和制定蒸汽车辆洗炉施行细则；（六）研究和制定机车放水制度及办法；（七）机车徽号标志暂行办法；（八）蒸汽车辆履历簿及办理手续；（九）机车调度员工作细则草案；（十）车辆标记路徽；（十一）整理机检段人事组织发挥效率，克服人力机械效能之浪费，有计划的进行调配及训练；（十二）研究统计规程办法；（十三）机械管理使用及检修规程暂行办法。这次大会会期十日，二十七日午后起由平津、郑州、太原，济南、京沪、武汉、东北各铁路局分别作机务工作报告，二十九日下午开始典型报告，并由东北、平津等局出席劳动英雄作经验介绍。七月一日起分组讨论，研究负责制及任务计划。五日休会，预定七月六日闭会总结。
