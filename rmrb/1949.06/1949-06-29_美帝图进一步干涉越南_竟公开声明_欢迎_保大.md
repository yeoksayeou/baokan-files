Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 28th -- According to American news agencies, American expansionists are attempting to further control Vietnam. Since Bảo Đại ascended the throne, the U.S. State Department issued a statement on the 21st, welcoming the establishment of the so-called "New Unified State of Vietnam" and the pro-American speech made by Bảo Đại upon his ascension. The statement implied that the United States hoped Vietnam could further break away from France and realize the so-called "legitimate ideals of the Vietnamese people." The United States also made a request to France to establish an "embassy" in Vietnam.

An Associated Press dispatch from New York on the 24th, analyzing the State Department's statement, frankly admitted that the United States' expression of "welcome" was only because "the French have established a puppet government under the leadership of former Annam King Bảo Đại," and "it is expected to help quell the revolution led by Ho Chi Minh." The Associated Press also said: "The United States' approval of Bảo Đại's government's declaration also indicates that the United States hopes for the ultimate genuine independence (?) that the French dislike." The Associated Press predicted that France would have no right to reject the so-called "genuine independence" of Vietnam, which the United States is preparing to continue directing, because the French in Vietnam are now "like the Dutch in Indonesia," and "must make concessions." In Indonesia, American imperialists are taking advantage of the Netherlands' inability to cope with the people's liberation movement, forcing the Netherlands to recognize the "independence" of the Hatta group, which is favored by the United States, attempting to suppress the Indonesian people and squeeze out the Dutch position in Indonesia through the help of the Hatta group. According to Agence France-Presse, after the U.S. State Department's statement was issued, Bảo Đại's spokesman, Fabre, stated on the 23rd that Bảo Đại was grateful for the United States' concern.

　　美帝图进一步干涉越南
  　竟公开声明“欢迎”保大
    【新华社北平二十八日电】据美国通讯社透露，美国扩张主义者正图进一步控制越南。自保大登位以后，美国务院曾于二十一日发表声明，欢迎所谓“新越南统一国家”之成立，及保大登位时发表的讨好美国的演说。声明暗示美国希望越南能进一步脱离法国，而实现所谓“越南人民之正当理想”。美国并向法国提出要求，要在越南设立“大使馆”。美联社纽约二十四日电分析美国务院的声明时，坦白承认美国之表示“欢迎”，只是因为“法国人已建立了一个在前安南王保大领导下的傀儡政府”，“预料它有将助于敉平胡志明领导的革命”。美联社又说：“美国赞同保大政府的声明，还表示美国希望着法国人所不喜欢的最后的真正独立（？）”。美联社预料法国将无权拒绝美国准备继续导演的所谓越南的“真正独立”，因为法国人目前在越南，“已象荷兰在印尼一样”，“必须采取让步”。在印尼，美国帝国主义者正利用了荷兰无力对付人民解放运动的弱点，逼迫荷兰承认美国所喜爱的哈达集团的“独立”，企图经过哈达集团的帮助，镇压印尼人民，并排挤荷兰在印尼的地位。据法新社讯，美国务院的声明发表后，保大的发言人法布洛曾于二十三日表示保大感谢美国的关心。
