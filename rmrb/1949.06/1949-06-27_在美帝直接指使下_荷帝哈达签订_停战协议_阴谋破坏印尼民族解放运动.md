Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 26th - Reports from various sources: Under the vigorous urging and personal direction of Mr. Cochran, the American representative of the United Nations Commission for Indonesia, the Netherlands and the Hatta Group of Indonesia formally signed a ceasefire agreement on the 22nd of this month. The agreement stipulates: (1) Dutch troops will begin withdrawing from the Yogyakarta area from the 24th, with the withdrawal to be completed within six days; (2) After the Hatta Group returns to the Yogyakarta area to "govern" on July 1st, it will order the former Republican Army within the guerrillas to cease fire as soon as possible in order to jointly suppress the Indonesian people's guerrillas with the Dutch army; (3) Both sides agree that the Hague Round Table Conference proposed by the Netherlands will be held on August 1st. The conference is nominally to discuss the scope, status, and power of the Hatta Group's so-called Indonesian "Republic" within the Dutch Indonesian Federation, but in reality, it is a meeting for the U.S. and the Netherlands to divide up Indonesian interests. The signing of the ceasefire agreement exposes the sinister attempt of American and Dutch imperialists to painstakingly sabotage the Indonesian national liberation movement. Under the direct interference of the United States, the Batavia Preparatory Conference (or preliminary talks) held by the Hatta Group and the Dutch colonialists to seek a compromise solution has lasted for two full months since it began on April 14th. During this period, a so-called "verbal agreement" was signed on May 7th, with Hatta promising to order the former Republican Army within the guerrillas to cease fire and cooperate with the Dutch army to "maintain law and order"; the Dutch side also promised to allow Hatta to "restore power" in the small Yogyakarta Special Region and then hold the Hague Conference. However, due to the rising anti-imperialist sentiment of the Indonesian people and the continued development of the guerrilla war, the Hatta Group was unable to quickly fulfill its promise to the Dutch colonialists, while the Dutch side insisted that a ceasefire must be implemented first before they would restore Hatta's "regime." At the same time, within the Indonesian reactionary bourgeoisie, there were also some differences regarding the terms of the compromise. The Indonesian former Prime Minister Sjahrir faction, belonging to the Hatta Group, demanded that the Dutch side make more concessions. Sjafruddin's emergency government also expressed dissatisfaction with the oral agreement of May 7. These factors caused the negotiations between the two sides to be delayed for a period after May 7. In order to break this stalemate, Indonesian national traitors Hatta and Sukarno organized a delegation in early this month to travel to the Atjeh region of northern Sumatra and the port of Kutaraadja (the only port controlled by the emergency government and its location) to persuade Sjafruddin to agree to the oral agreement. Although the results of this trip have not been made public, it is not difficult to see from the so-called "ceasefire agreement" on the 22nd that the Dutch colonialists have agreed to obtain the cooperation of the Sjafruddin government in opposing the Indonesian people by making minor concessions to the Indonesian reactionary bourgeoisie. This is precisely what the U.S. imperialists stipulated in their plan on the Indonesian issue proposed at the Security Council in January of this year and Canada in March. According to a U.S. News Service report from Lake Success on the 23rd, "United Nations officials expressed satisfaction with the news that the negotiations between the Netherlands and the Republic of Indonesia, under the auspices of the United Nations Commission for Indonesia, have made smooth progress." However, according to a Reuters report, even the reactionary Dutch Catholic Party, when commenting on the ceasefire agreement on the 23rd, expressed doubt about the real effectiveness of the agreement.

　　在美帝直接指使下
  　荷帝哈达签订“停战协议”
    阴谋破坏印尼民族解放运动
    【新华社北平二十六日电】各方报道：在联合国印尼委员会美国代表柯契伦极力催促和亲自主持之下，荷兰与印尼的哈达集团已于本月二十二日正式订立停战协议。该协议规定：（一）荷军自二十四日起开始自日惹区撤退，定于六日内撤退完毕；（二）在哈达集团定于七月一日返回日惹区“执政”后，将尽快命令游击队中的前共和军停战，以与荷军共同镇压印尼人民游击队；（三）双方同意荷兰所建议召集的海牙圆桌会议，订于八月一日举行。会议名义上是讨论哈达集团的所谓印尼“共和国”在荷兰印尼联邦中的范围、地位及权力问题，实际上是美荷争夺印尼利益的分脏会议。停战协议的订立，暴露了美国和荷兰帝国主义者处心积虑地破坏印尼民族解放运动的阴险企图。在美国直接干涉下，哈达集团与荷兰殖民者为谋取妥协方案而举行的巴达维亚预备会议（或称初步会谈），自四月十四日开始以来，已有两个整月。其间，曾于五月七日订立所谓“口头协议”，哈达约许命令游击队中的前共和军停战，并与荷军合作以“维持治安”；荷方亦约许准予哈达在小小的日惹特区内“恢复政权”，然后举行海牙会议。但由于印尼人民反帝情绪的高涨，游击战争的继续发展，使哈达集团无法迅速实现对荷兰殖民者的诺言，而荷方则坚持必须先行停战才愿恢复哈达“的政权”。同时，在印尼反动资产阶级内部，对于妥协的条件亦有若干分歧，属于哈达集团的印尼前总理沙利尔一派要求荷方多作一点让步。斯查佛鲁丁的紧急政府对五月七日的口头协议也表示不满。这些因素，曾使双方的谈判在五月七日以后拖延了一个时期。为了打破这一迁延局面，印尼民族叛徒哈达和苏哈诺，曾于本月上旬组织一代表团，到苏门答腊北部的阿提杰地区和库塔拉查港（紧急政府所控制的唯一港口及其所在地），游说斯查佛鲁丁同意口头协议。此行结果虽未经公布，但从二十二日的所谓“停战协议”中不难看出，荷兰殖民者已同意以对印尼反动资产阶级的细小让步，来取得斯查佛鲁丁政府的合作以反对印尼人民，这正是美帝国主义于今年一月和加拿大于三月间在安理会上提出的印尼问题计划中所规定的。据美新闻处成功湖二十三日电称：“联合国官员对于荷兰与印尼共和国在联合国印尼委员会主持下的谈判获得顺利进展的消息，表示欣慰”。但据路透社讯，甚至荷兰反动的天主教党二十三日在评二十二日停战协议时，对于该协议的真正效力，亦表示怀疑。
