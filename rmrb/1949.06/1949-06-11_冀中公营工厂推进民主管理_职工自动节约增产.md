　　Jizhong Public Factories Promote Democratic Management
  　Workers Automatically Conserve and Increase Production
    [Jizhong Electric] State-owned Jizhong Industrial Company's directly affiliated factories are gradually promoting the democratization of factory management. This movement began this spring. The method is to improve workers' sense of ownership through education, and on this basis, organize workers to criticize leaders, check waste, and inspire all employees to contribute ideas and actively participate in factory management. For example, when employees of the Julong Iron Factory reviewed their leaders, they pointed out the lack of a sound work recording and attendance system, unclear rewards and punishments, leaders failing to promptly resolve or respond to workers' suggestions, and failure to consult with everyone when dealing with problems. This made the leadership realize that the reason why the iron factory's work had not been able to proceed smoothly for a long time was not extreme democratization, but that the leadership was not democratic enough and had not fully relied on workers to develop and organize their enthusiasm. When checking for waste, chemical workers pointed out that the factory employed 40 extra employees, that coal consumption in the past was wasteful by as much as 100%, and that the quality of sulfide blue could not be guaranteed due to the lack of quantitative standards for the use of materials. They then immediately proposed launching a conservation competition. Kang Bo, a technician at the match factory, and the workers jointly researched and invented phosphorus sulfide, and modified the barrel-making machine and circular closing splint, improving the quality of matches. A technician at the Dingxian Flour Mill took the initiative to learn technology from technicians at the Baoshi Gan Yi Flour Company, and requested to replace the Yan furnace to reduce coal consumption and strive to improve quality. The factory also promptly reported market conditions and factory operations to the employees, and the employees formulated production plans, which were then revised and approved by the factory, thus ensuring production. Regarding the democratic election of the factory management committee, in the past, the management committee of the Julong Iron Factory was appointed by the factory administration, and the factory director would convene meetings whenever he wanted, but the meetings did not solve problems. This time, some good veteran workers were elected to the committee to lead all employees in democratically assessing wages and implementing the progressive wage system, breaking the egalitarian wage system and boosting workers' morale. Regarding the trade union, in the past, the leather factory was entirely controlled by the factory director. Now, the approach is to help the trade union allocate manpower, strengthen worker unity, and improve production technology. The trade union feels that its work has become lively, and the workers, under the leadership of the trade union, are consciously and actively producing, breaking the past administrative commandist style. The factory director said, "In the past, I wasted my efforts and didn't do it well. Now that democratic management is implemented, it's really done well."

　　冀中公营工厂推进民主管理
  　职工自动节约增产
    【冀中电】国营冀中实业公司直属各厂正逐步推进工厂管理民主化。此一运动开始于今春，方法是经过教育，提高工人的主人翁思想，在此基础上组织工人批评领导，检查浪费，启发全体职工出主意，积极参加工厂管理。如聚隆铁工厂职工检讨领导时，指出没有健全的记工考勤制度，赏罚不明，工人提了意见，领导上不及时解决与答复，处理问题不和大伙商量等，使得领导上认识到铁工厂的工作长期不能顺利开展的原因，不是极端民主化，而是领导上不够民主，没有充分依靠工人，发挥与组织工人的积极性所致。检查浪费时，化学工人指出全厂多用着四十名职工，过去烧煤浪费达一倍，制硫化青因使用材料没定量，保不住质量等，并随即提出开展节约竞赛。火柴厂技师康波和工人们共同研究发明硫化磷，改制节桶机、圆闭夹板，提高了火柴质量。定县面粉厂技师主动的向保市干义面粉公司的技师学习技术，并要求换燕炉，减少烧煤量，努力提高质量。工厂也及时的把市场情况及工厂经营等情况报告职工，并由职工订出生产计划，再由工厂修正批准，这样使生产有了保证。在民主选举工厂管理委员会方面，过去，聚隆铁工厂管理委员，是由厂行政上聘请的，且厂长要开会就开会，开会也不解决问题。这次把一些好的老工人选到委员会来，领导全体职工民主评订工资，贯彻了交义累进工资制，打破了平均主义的工资制度，工人生产情绪提高。在工会方面，过去皮革厂是厂长包办一切，现在是帮助工会配备人力，加强职工团结，改进生产技术等，工会觉得工作有了生气，工人在工会领导下也都自觉的积极生产，打破了过去行政上的命令主义作风，厂长说：“过去我是白费了劲也没弄好，现在实行民主管理后，可真弄好了。”
