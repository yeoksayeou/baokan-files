Strange Phenomena in America

　　I. New Post-War "Prosperity," Making Money and Shutting Down
　　The textile industry is the first among various American industries to feel the post-war economic instability in the United States. In the autumn of 1948, a textile factory owner in New Hampshire closed his fifth factory. This factory had annual sales of $100 million and a net profit of over $3.8 million in the first half of 1948.
　　Due to exorbitant prices, inflation, and low real wages, American families were forced to tighten their belts, leaving them little money for new clothes. Last spring, a nationwide boycott movement swept across the United States. However, American factory owners, although very anxious about the future of business, were unwilling to lower prices, preferring to reduce production and lay off workers. In New England and the American South, textile factories closed one after another, with factories operating only three or four days a week.
　　Now, the only factories that can survive are those of the large monopoly capitalists, who earned nearly $30 billion in 1947, almost five times more than in 1939, and even more in 1948.

　　II. Many Skyscrapers, Deep Housing Crisis
　　Although America's rulers may boast about how much money they have spent building skyscrapers in New York, they will not tell you anything about the living conditions in New York's working-class districts. These districts are only a 10- to 15-minute drive from the residential areas of New York's wealthy, but the percentage of lung diseases here is several times higher than in the average city, and the infant mortality rate is three times higher than in better residential areas. Official New York data admit that the living conditions of 16 million Americans are extremely poor, and 450,000 New York families live in uninhabitable housing.
　　The situation in New York's hospitals is also very bad. Many old hospitals are falling apart, and new ones have not yet been built. Twenty-five million Americans (more than one-sixth of the entire US population) suffer from chronic diseases, and 40 million Americans live in areas without good hospital facilities.
　　Nevertheless, America's rulers have not taken any measures to improve the situation. As a result of the lobbying activities of American real estate companies, the post-war US Congress did not pass a housing program. Appropriations of $35 million for housing construction were also halted due to their efforts. The price of building materials is uncontrolled, and the construction industry is at a standstill.
　　Apartments in America have long become a source of profit, and even respectable American congressmen are manipulating this housing crisis. Former Democratic Senator O'Daniel of Texas bought a four-story building in Washington and evicted all the tenants. Later, he sold the building at a high price and moved into another small house himself.
　　If someone wants to rent a room in New York and finally finds one after much effort, the landlord will point to the armchair in the corner and say to you:
　　"That chair is worth a thousand dollars."
　　"Oh? I don't want this chair."
　　"Then maybe you don't want this chair, but if you want this room, you also have to buy that chair."
　　This is very common in New York.

　　美国怪现象
　　一、战后新“繁荣”，赚钱又关门
    纺织业是美国各种工业中最先感到美国战后经济不稳定的一种工业。一九四八年秋，新罕布什尔的一个纺织厂老板关闭了他的第五个工厂。这个工厂一年产品的销售额是一亿美元，一九四八年上半年获有净利三百八十余万美元。
    由于物价奇昂，通货膨胀与实际工资低落，使美国一般家庭的开支紧缩，他们很少有余钱添置新衣服。去年春天，全美国普遍掀起了一个抵货运动。但美国的工厂主虽然对商业前途很为焦虑，他们亦不肯减低物价，他们宁可降低生产与解雇工人。在新英格兰与美国南部，纺织工厂一个跟着一个地关门了，工厂里一星期只做三天或四天的工。
    现在，唯一能存在的工厂，是那些大独占资本家们的工厂，这些工厂在一九四七年赚了将近三百亿美元，几乎五倍于一九三九年，而一九四八年赚的比这还多。
　　二、摩天大楼多，房屋危机深
    尽管美国的统治者们会夸耀说他们用了多少钱来建筑纽约的摩天大楼，但他们不会告诉你一点关于纽约工人区的生活状况。纽约的工人区离纽约富人们的住宅区只有十分钟到十五分钟的车行距离，在这里，肺病的百分比就较一般城市高出数倍，婴孩死亡率三倍于较好的住宅区。纽约官方材料承认，有一千六百万美国人的居住条件非常低劣，有四十五万个纽约家庭住在不宜居住的房屋中。
    纽约的医院情况亦非常之坏。许多旧的医院快坏了，新的还没有盖。有二千五百万美国人（占全美人口六分之一以上）患有慢性病，四千万美国人住在没有良好医院设备的地区内。
    虽然如此，但美国的统治者并未进行任何改善情况的措施。美国地产公司的议会贿赂者的活动结果，是战后美国国会没有通过房屋纲领。三千五百万美元的造屋信用拨款，亦由于这些人的努力而停拨了。建筑材料的价格毫无控制，建筑业陷于停滞。
    公寓在美国早已成为赚钱的东西，连堂堂的美国议员亦在玩弄这一房屋危机。塔干撤州民主党前任参议员奥丹尼尔在华盛顿买了一座四层楼的房子，把所有的住户都赶了出去。以后，他又以高价把这座楼卖出去，自己搬进另外一个小屋住。
    如果有人要在纽约租一间屋子，而且终于辛辛苦苦地找到了，房主人就会指着角落上的靠背椅对你说：
    “那椅子值一千元。”
    “哦？我不要这只椅子。”
    “那你也许不要这只椅子，你要这间屋子，你就亦要买那只椅子。”
    这在纽约是很普通的事情。
