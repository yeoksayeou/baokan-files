Pushkin of the Russian People
Ai Qing

    Under the gloomy sky,
    In the wilderness of Siberia,
    The singer of freedom—Pushkin,
    Sang a song like a raging wind:
    “To smash the heavy shackles,
    To open the dark prison doors,
    Freedom will welcome you at the door,
    Brothers will return the swords to you.”
    Brave poet,
    “Not fearing insults,
    Not seeking laurels,”
    With the prophet's fire burning in his chest,
    Spitting out sparks of language from his mouth,
    These sparks ignited the people's faith,
    These sparks made the tyrant tremble in fear!
    Pushkin loved Russia,
    Russia nurtured Pushkin,
    Pushkin loved Russia's land, hills,
    Rivers and forests,
    From here he felt the people's sorrows and joys;
    Pushkin loved Mikhailovskoye village,
    From here he heard the peasants' lamenting voices;
    Pushkin loved his nanny Arina,
    Arina would tell him folk tales;
    Pushkin loved the heroic Decembrists,
    The Decembrists were engaged in revolutionary struggle;
    Pushkin loved the strong people of Russia,
    The people gave him wisdom and strength,
    The people gave him clear, simple language;
    But Pushkin hated Tsar Alexander,
    Hated the court ministers, hated the governor-generals,
    Because these people were greedy, brutal, and oppressed the people!
    Complaints and scolding,
    Shamed the court,
    Curses and satire,
    Pierced the tyrant,
    Thus, insidious enemies,
    Exhausted all efforts to set a trap,
    To tame and capture Pushkin…
    But, neither money nor power,
    Rumors and slanders,
    Exile and imprisonment,
    Never made the poet yield or change his heart.
    Unfortunately, a terrible conspiracy,
    Finally confused Pushkin,
    D'Anthès' despicable bullet,
    Shot Pushkin in the chest,
    Pushkin fell!
    Genius and glory were murdered!
    The world was dark, the wind roared,
    Pouring out the people's anger and injustice…
    And "the star of enchanting happiness
    Is about to rise, emitting light,
    Russia is about to awaken from its sleep…"
    Following the prophecy and standing up,
    Are the great Russian people!
    After a hundred years of struggle,
    The Russian people have won!
    Destroyed the dark rule,
    Established Soviet power,
    Now, on the vast land,
    From Leningrad to Kamchatka,
    Everywhere are flowers, beautiful fruits,
    The laughter of laborers and the songs of freedom…

    俄罗斯人民的普希金
    艾青
    在阴暗的天空下，
    在西伯利亚的旷野上，
    自由的歌手——普希金，
    唱出了狂风似的歌声：
    “要粉碎沉重的枷锁，
    要打开黑暗的牢门，
    自由将在门口欢迎，
    弟兄将把利剑送还你们。”
    勇敢的诗人，
    “不畏惧侮辱，
    不希求桂冠”，
    胸中燃烧先知的烈火，
    嘴里喷出语言的火星，
    这火星点亮了人民的信心，
    这火星使那暴君看到发抖震惊！
    普希金爱俄罗斯，
    俄罗斯养大了普希金，
    普希金爱俄罗斯的土地、山岗、
    河流和森林，
    他从这儿感受到人民的忧愁和欢欣；
    普希金爱米哈伊罗夫斯克村，
    他从这儿听到了农奴悲叹的声音；
    普希金爱他的褓姆阿林娜，
    阿林娜会讲民间故事给他听；
    普希金爱英勇的十二月党人，
    十二月党人正在进行革命斗争；
    普希金爱俄罗斯坚强的人民，
    人民给他以智慧和力量，
    人民给他以明晰、朴素的语言；
    但普希金恨沙皇亚历山大，
    恨皇朝的大臣，恨总督老爷，
    因为这些人贪婪、残暴、欺压人民！
    怨言和怒骂，
    羞辱了宫廷，
    诅咒和讽刺，
    刺痛了暴君，
    于是，阴险的敌人，
    用尽心机布置圈套，
    来驯服和俘掳普希金……
    但是，无论金钱和权力，
    流言和诽谤，
    放逐和监禁，
    都不曾使诗人屈服变心。
    不幸，可怕的阴谋，
    终于迷乱了普希金，
    丹特士可耻的子弹，
    射中了普希金的心胸，
    普希金倒下了！
    天才和光荣被杀害了！
    天地昏暗，狂风怒吼，
    吐不尽人民的愤怒与不平……
    而“迷人的幸福的星辰
    就要上升，射出光芒，
    俄罗斯要从睡梦中苏醒……”
    跟随着预言站起来的，
    是伟大的俄罗斯人民！
    经历了百年的斗争，
    俄罗斯人民胜利了！
    摧毁了黑暗的统治，
    建立了苏维埃政权，
    如今，在辽阔的土地上，
    从列宁格勒到堪察加，
    到处是鲜花、美果，
    劳动者的欢笑和自由的歌声……
      一九四九年六月六日
