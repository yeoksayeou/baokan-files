　　“Backward Heads” (Part 2)

  　　　　　(Seven) "Where Shall We Go?"
    Four Isku machine guns were deployed on either side of the Zhangwu Bridge. Two on the east bank of the river and two on the west, forming a high-altitude crossfire network to protect the comrades repairing the bridge.
    When deploying this position, the battalion commander brought together the company commander and the Isku gunners. To Han Junting's surprise, he was also called – all thanks to his company commander's recommendation. The battalion commander explained the mission of the four Iskus in the entire battalion: anti-aircraft fire to protect the site. Then, they discussed the deployment plan for the four Iskus. Because no one except the battalion commander had seen the entire position, no one could offer a definite opinion.
    "I say, it's better for the battalion commander to take us to have a look and then study it, than guessing riddles in the house!" Han Junting suggested.
    "Good! Let's go and take a look!"
    The battalion commander was a straightforward person, and he stood up as he spoke. Everyone went to both sides of the Zhangwu Bridge to take a look. Although there were some differences of opinion, the locations of three Isku machines were confirmed. Only the placement of the last one remained, and the two opinions were at odds.
    There were few hills around the Zhangwu Bridge. The highest was a sand dune on the east bank of the river. Everyone agreed that, in terms of high ground and ease of anti-aircraft fire – especially against low-flying aircraft – the Isku should be placed there. However, there was only one small tree there, and nothing else, so concealment was difficult. This was why many people disagreed. Han Junting insisted:
    "I say, it's better to put it there. As long as it's easy to exert firepower, a little less concealment doesn't matter, because it's not easy to defeat us!"
    "Air defense is not like anything else. Airplanes specifically look for anti-aircraft positions to eliminate first. If you can't hide, and they concentrate their forces to eliminate you, what can you do?" one comrade said.
    "It's not like we can't hide at all. We can hide under that tree. Before we open fire, I guarantee the enemy won't find us! I'll wait until they get close and suddenly give them a blow, knocking one down. The others will be flustered when they want to retaliate!"
    "You're only thinking about your own situation! What if it doesn't work!?" someone retorted.
    The battalion commander considered for a while, and finally agreed with Han Junting's opinion. Han Junting happily volunteered, grabbed Liu Fuzeng, the leader of the Isku machine squad in his company, and excitedly said:
    "Squad Leader Liu! We're going there! We're going there! It's settled!" Han Junting turned to the battalion commander again: "Battalion Commander! We're going!"
    "You can go!" The battalion commander paused, raised his head, and added: "However, everyone must remember, company commanders, squad leaders, and gunners must be responsible. The four Iskus must act in coordination and support each other. You must not let one fire while the others watch. That would be a disadvantage!"
    After the meeting, Han Junting pulled the other three Isku machine squad leaders aside and talked for a long time, as if he were the chairman, studying how the West Bank Isku machines should fire if enemy planes came from the east, how the East Bank should fire if they came from the west, how to deal with planes coming from both sides in a crossfire, and how to deal with planes coming from the north and south... He thought of many plans and studied many methods, and everyone had a lot of confidence before dispersing.
    　　　　(Eight) Land-Air Battle
    On the high sand dune with a solitary tree, Liu Fuzeng's Isku machine was set up, positioned right under the solitary tree. Han Junting and Liu Fuzeng had already planned together. They had dug some fortifications near the tree, and they both agreed that they couldn't pile everyone in the two squads here, as it would be easy to cause casualties if the enemy plane spotted them; therefore, they dug many individual air-raid shelters in the grass and bushes thirty meters away below the sand dune, preparing for the rest of the people to hide. Han Junting also specifically gave the comrades who were preparing to hide in the grass their mission, telling them to use rifles to prepare to fire at the enemy plane when it attacked the sand dune.
    Several times, enemy planes came and the battalion sounded an air raid alarm. Han Junting and Liu Fuzeng's two squads acted according to plan; the first couple of times, they seemed a bit flustered, but later they became very orderly. Everyone also felt that enemy planes were nothing to be afraid of; because the enemy planes only passed twice, without firing or dropping bombs.
    "The mourning hasn't been enough yet, let them come mourn a few more times!" Ma Ziliang often said this: "After killing someone, doesn't Chiang Kai-shek have to come and pay his respects?"
    "Paying respects is paying respects, but they don't dare to stick their heads out to take a look! Just humming! What a bear!" Liu Fuzeng echoed, and many new soldiers joined in the fun, feeling that these planes were just humming, and although they were a little afraid at first, they now regarded them as toys.
    Han Junting listened to everyone's nonsense and watched their optimism. At first, he was like usual, not saying a word, letting them say whatever they wanted - as long as it didn't bother him. He spent the day going back and forth, looking at the Isku, looking at the dug fortifications, and telling the gunners how to remain calm when shooting down planes.
    "What are you afraid of, one or two planes!? During the defense of Siping, there were twenty or thirty planes at a time. At first, everyone was a little nervous, and they threw bombs and shot everywhere, causing a lot of trouble. Later, everyone thought, damn it, you can't give them face, the more face you give them, the more shameless they become! You still have to beat them. After that, when the planes came, anti-aircraft guns, machine guns, rifles... ha, everything came together, and they were stunned, knocking down a few planes, and then they never dared to fly down and bully people again!..."
    "Flying down doesn't matter either, who's afraid of them!" New soldier Zhang Jizu often said this. Han Junting listened unhappily, glared, and put on that stern face again:
    "You can't say that. If we fight well, they can't do anything, but if we fumble, they really dare to smash you with bombs! If they fly low, they can see everything, do you think they don't dare to bite!?"
    As soon as an alarm went off, Han Junting quickly ran to his post - in front of the Isku machine. He quickly arranged his squad, and then concentrated on looking at the sky.
    That day, it was already past ten in the morning. The planes flew north first, then south. Everyone from top to bottom thought:
    "It's over! Nothing's going to happen!?"
    The comrades repairing the bridge shouted slogans, carrying sand, carrying stones, driving piles... thousands of people were working hard. On the blackboard newspaper, they praised this one and then that one; the loudspeaker shouted back and forth:
    "Comrade Li Wenhua insists on working, without rest. He broke his foot, but didn't leave the site. This spirit is worth learning from!"
    "The cooks of the First Company take turns delivering boiling water to the site, ensuring that everyone doesn't drink cold water. They are really active and responsible!"
    "The comrades driving piles are driving thirty hammers a minute, really hard working!..."
    Soldiers and cadres were all working, sweating profusely. The air defense sentry was only paying attention to everyone's excitement. They were not paying much attention to the air. At two thirty in the afternoon, people were still so nervous, when two planes suddenly appeared from the east. The sound of people working and shouting drowned out the sound of the planes. The planes came from the east again, and the air surveillance sentry didn't pay attention at all. People only realized it and sounded the air raid alarm when the planes were already overhead.
    Just as people were scattering and hiding in a hurry, the two planes swooped down like arrows. Han Junting's Isku was still facing west, and Liu Fuzeng desperately twisted it to the east. As the gun was turning around, the two planes swooped down like swallows, and the machine guns rattled, kicking up dust from the ground. As the two turned and rose to the west, the other three Isku machines fired, but in reality, none of the Isku's shots hit the planes.
    The planes flew into the high sky, whistling triumphantly.
    "Damn it! Come again!" Han Junting cursed.
    Sure enough, in less than two minutes, the planes returned from the west. Han Junting shouted, "Attention!" and leaned close to Liu Fuzeng. The two planes circled to the northwest, turned to the north, and swept and pounced along the area where the two Iskus on the west bank were located. Liu Fuzeng and Han Junting saw clearly that the Isku fired as the planes rushed down low. The two planes did not rush down very low, but took off and ran. However, the firing of Han Junting's gun was discovered by two planes attacking from the east. As Han Junting and the other three Iskus were paying attention to those two planes, these two suddenly came down from the east, with six bombs in a row. One bomb landed on the slope of the sand dune, and shrapnel pierced Liu Fuzeng's right arm, causing blood to flow. Two people helped him down. The other five bombs all landed near the site. Although no one was injured, a lot of equipment was indeed damaged.
    Han Junting didn't say a word, blinked his eyes a few times, and breathed heavily through his nostrils. He rushed forward, grabbed the Isku, and fired at the planes that had just risen. But he was a step late and failed to hit them. Han Junting turned his head sharply and glanced eastward. A triumphant smile appeared on the corner of his mouth. He quickly turned the muzzle of the gun. The first plane, which had circled from the south to the east, was rushing straight towards the solitary tree on the sand dune. Han Junting calmed down and watched:
    "Good!"
    Before he finished speaking, Han Junting's Isku fired, and the rifles below fired. The machine guns on the plane also fired. Sand and soil rose around Han Junting, and his left arm was scratched - Han Junting didn't notice, and Ma Ziliang and the others didn't see it either. The second plane rushed over again. Han Junting calmly aimed and fired fiercely. The enemy plane was also firing fiercely, wanting to eliminate this machine gun first. Han Junting's leg was pierced again, and his body went soft for a while, and he sat down.
    "Good! Good shot!"
    "Shot it down! It's on fire!"
    The soldiers hiding in the sorghum fields, corn fields, and all around shouted. Ma Ziliang pushed him aside, took over, and prepared to fire.
    Han Junting's artery was injured in his leg, and he was bleeding a lot. His face turned pale, he felt dizzy for a while, and he fell down.

　　“落后的脑袋”（二续）

  　　　　　（七）“咱们去那里”
    彰武桥的两边，一共布置了四架伊斯古机关炮。河东岸两架，河西岸又是两架，对岸组成高空中交叉火网，掩护桥上抢修的同志们。
    在布置这个阵地时，营长把连长和伊斯古的射手们都找来，出乎韩俊庭意外地也把他找了去——这都是由于他的连长的介绍。营长说明全营四架伊斯古的任务：对空射击，掩护现场。然后，把四架伊斯古布署的方案，交谈了一下子。因为除了营长之外，谁也没有全面地把阵地看过，谁也提不出个一定意见。
    “我说，由营长带着咱们去看看，再研究，比这在屋子猜谜好的多！”韩俊庭提了个意见。
    “好！咱们就去，看看再说！”
    营长是个爽快人，说着就站了起来。大家一齐到彰武桥两岸去看了一回。虽然意见有些不同，三架伊斯古机的按放地点，还是肯定了。剩下了最后一架的按放，两个意见，相持不下。
    彰武桥边，山岗很少，顶高的是河东岸有个沙邱，要按地势高，便于对空射击——尤其低飞的飞机——一点来说，大家意见一致赞成把伊斯古放在那里，但那里只有一棵小树，其余别的，什么也没有，所以，掩蔽就困难。许多人不同意，原因就在这里。韩俊庭坚持着：
    “我说还是放在那里，只要便于发扬火力，掩蔽差点也不要紧，因为它不便把咱们打垮！”
    “防空不是别的，飞机专找的是对空阵地，尽先消灭，你不能隐蔽，他集中力量消灭你，你有什么办法？”有一个同志说。
    “那也不是完全不能隐蔽呀，就在那棵树下，未开火之前，保险敌人发现不了！我就等他临近了，突然给他一家伙，揍下一架来，别的想报复，也慌了神啦！”
    “你光打你一头想，还有个不成的！？……”别人不服地说。
    营长考虑了一会，最后，却同意了韩俊庭的意见，韩俊庭高兴地自告奋勇，拉住本连伊斯古机班长刘福增，兴奋地说道：
    “刘班长！咱们去那里！咱们去那里！行了！”韩俊庭又转脸对营长：“营长！我们去！”
    “你们去，可以！”营长把话沉了一沉，扬起头来补充说道：“不过，大家一定记住，各连长各位班长射手们要负责，四架伊斯古一定要协同动作，互相呼应，千万不能这个打那个看着，那就要吃亏啦！”
    散了会，韩俊庭把另外三个伊斯古机的班长，又拉住谈了半天，好象他当了主席，研究敌人飞机从东方冲来，西岸伊斯古机应如何打法，从西冲来，东岸应如何打法，两边交叉冲来，怎样对付，南北冲来，如何对付……想了许多方案，研究了许多办法，大家都有了很足的信心，散了回去。
    　　　　（八）陆空对战
    长着一棵孤树的高沙邱上，刘福增的伊斯古机架在上面，位置就在那棵孤树的下边。韩俊庭早已和刘福增共同计划一回，在树的近旁，挖了一些工事，他俩意见一致主张：不能把两个班的人都堆在这里，万一被敌机发现，便容易伤亡；所以，在沙邱下边三十米远的草丛灌木丛里，又挖了许多单人防空坑，准备余下的人们隐蔽。韩俊庭也特意地给那些准备在草丛隐蔽的同志们，交代了任务，要他们用步枪，准备在敌机向沙邱上进攻时对空射击。
    几次敌人飞机来，营里发出空袭警报，韩俊庭和刘福增这两个班，便按计划行动；第一两回，显着有些慌乱，后来，变得很有次序了。大家又觉着敌人飞机没什么了不起了；因为敌机只是过了两回，没有放枪，也没有扔弹。
    “吊丧还没有吊够呢，让它多来吊几回吧！”马子亮常这样地说：“整死了人家，还不兴蒋介石来吊孝？”
    “吊孝可是吊孝，就是不敢伸下头来看看！光哼哼！真熊包！”刘福增就附和着，许多新战士也跟着凑热闹，觉着这些飞机也不过就是哼哼而已，当初有点怕，现在都把它当成个玩艺。
    韩俊庭听着大家乱扯，看着大家那种乐观劲，起初，和平时一样，也不吭气，爱说什么说什么——反正不碍着自己就行。一天钻过来转过去，看看伊斯古，看看挖的工事，给射手们讲打飞机要如何沉着。
    “这一个两个，怕什么！？在保卫四平时，一来就是二三十架，起初，大家有点发毛，它到处扔蛋打枪，把人们整的够呛。以后，大家想，妈的，这东西不能给他脸，越给脸它越不要脸！还是得揍它，以后飞机一来，高射炮、机关枪、步枪，……哈，什么都有，一齐来，一家伙把它造蒙了头，干掉了几架，以后再也不敢飞下来欺负人了！……”
    “飞下来，也没啥关系，谁还怕它！”新战士张继祖常这样说。韩俊庭听着不入耳，把眼睛一横，又板起那个铁板子脸：
    “可不能那末说，咱们打的好，它没法，咱们要是忙了手脚，它可真敢用炸弹砸你！飞低了，什么都看的见，你寻思它不敢咬人哪！？”
    只要是警报一发出来，韩俊庭迅速地就跑到自己岗位上——伊斯古机的跟前。很快地把本班的人们按排一定，便聚精会神地望着天空。
    这天，已经过了上午十点钟，飞机先向北飞过去，后又飞向南。从上到下大家都以为：
    “完了！没事啦！？”
    桥上抢修的同志们，喊着口号，抬沙子抬石头打桩，……上千的人们紧张地工作着。黑板报上，表扬了这个，又表扬那个；广播筒来回地呼喊着：
    “李文华同志坚持工作，不休息，＠破了脚，不下现场，这种精神，值得大家学习！”
    “第一连伙夫同志们，轮流把开水送到现场，保证大家不喝凉水，真是积极负责！”
    “打桩的同志们，一分钟打三十锤，真正努力！……”
    战士们，干部们，都在工作中，忙的满头大汗。防空哨只顾看大家的热闹劲。对空中也不大注意了。下午两点半钟的时候，人们还是那样地紧张，从东方忽然出现了两架飞机，人们的工作呼喊声，压住了飞机的响声，飞机又从东方来，对空监视哨根本就没有注意这一着。飞机已经到了头上时，人们才发觉，才发出了空袭警报。
    正在人们忙乱地四散隐蔽时，这两架飞机，箭似地向下飘来，韩俊庭那里的伊斯古，枪口还朝西，刘福增拼命地向东扭，当着枪口才转过时，两架飞机象燕子似的点下来，机关枪嘎嘎地响了，打的地上灰尘直冒。当着它两个反身向西上方飘升时，另外三架伊斯古机都响了起来，实际上，没有一架伊斯古的射击沾到飞机的边。
    飞机得意地发着尖哨的声音飘到高空。
    “操他妈的！再来！”韩俊庭骂着。
    果然不上两分钟的功夫、飞机又打西边返回来。韩俊庭大喊了一声：“注意！”紧紧地靠到刘福增跟前，那两架飞机绕到西北方，转到北方，顺着河西两架伊斯古所在地带，边扫边扑过来。刘福增韩俊庭看的明白，当着飞机冲到低处时，伊斯古响了。两架飞机并没有冲得很低，飘起就跑。可是韩俊庭这地方的枪一响，就被又从东方袭来的两架飞机发现了。当着韩俊庭他们和另外三架伊期古正在注意那两架飞机时，从东来的这两架突然下来，连着就是六个炸弹。一个弹落在沙邱的坡上，弹片打穿了刘福增的右臂，血忽忽地流着，两个人把他扶了下去，另外五个炸弹都落到现场附近，虽然没有伤人，器材确实损坏了不少。
    韩俊庭一声没吭，两眼眨了几眨，鼻孔里夫夫地出气，抢上前抓住了伊斯古，照着那才升起来的飞机就射击。但是迟了一步，未能打上。韩俊庭敏捷地回过头来向东方看了一眼，他嘴角上挂上了得意的笑纹，连忙回转枪口，从南面绕到东方去的第一架飞机，已经直奔着沙邱孤树冲了过来，韩俊庭平住气，两眼望着：
    “好哇！”
    一声没完，韩俊庭的伊斯古响了，下边的步枪响了，飞机上的机枪也响了。韩俊庭的身边沙土冒起来，左臂肉上挂了花——韩俊庭不知觉，马子亮他们也没看着。第二架飞机又冲了过来。韩俊庭沉着地瞄准，猛烈地射击，敌机也是猛烈地扫射，想是首先消灭这架机关炮。韩俊庭的腿上又穿透了，身了一阵子发软，坐了下来。
    “好！打的好！”
    “打掉啦！着啦！”
    高粮地里，苞米地里，四下地里隐蔽的战士们喊着。韩俊庭坐在地上眼望着那架着了火的飞机向西北方栽了下去。马子亮把他推到一边，接过去，准备射击。
    韩俊庭的腿上伤了动脉管，血流的多，一阵子脸发白，头发晕，倒下了。
    　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　（未完）
