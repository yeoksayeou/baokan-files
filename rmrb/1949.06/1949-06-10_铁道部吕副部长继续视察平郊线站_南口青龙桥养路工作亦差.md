　　Railway Ministry Vice Minister Lü Continues Inspection of Pingjiao Line Stations
　　Poor Maintenance Work Also Found at Nankou and Qinglongqiao

　　[Our Paper's News] After inspecting and checking the maintenance work at Beijing East Station, Fengtai, and other locations, Lü Zhengcao, Vice Minister of the Central Military Commission's Railway Ministry, inspected and checked Nankou, Qinglongqiao, and other line stations on the 5th. He similarly found that the Beijing Engineering Section and Nankou Station were neglecting maintenance work: 1. Wild grass grows profusely along the 37-kilometer road surface from Beijing Xizhimen to Changping East, affecting roadbed drainage and easily corroding sleepers. Immediate attention should be paid to weeding work. 2. A large portion of the track spikes are loose from Nankou to Qinglongqiao. This section of the line winds around mountains and tunnels, and is rugged and uneven. The slope of the line is higher than any other railway slope in the country, which will endanger driving safety. 3. Sixty percent of the sleepers are decayed and broken. Soil and sand accumulation within the station buries the sleepers, which is the main reason for the rapid damage to the sleepers. 4. Insufficient attention is paid to the care of locomotives and station hygiene. The locomotives have not been cleaned for a long time. In addition, the deputy section chief and engineers of the section could not answer how many kilometers each locomotive travels on average per day. This shows that the "implementation of the responsibility system" in the Nankou Locomotive Depot is not serious enough and lacks planning. The responsible comrades of the Nankou and Qinglongqiao railway sections should immediately pay attention to maintenance work and correct the superficial style of work.

　　铁道部吕副部长继续视察平郊线站
  　南口青龙桥养路工作亦差
    【本报讯】中央军委铁道部吕正操副部长等，继视察检查北平东站、丰台等养路工作之后，复于五日视察检查南口、青龙桥等线站，同样发现北平工务段及南口站忽视养路工作：一、从北平西直门到昌平东三十七公里路面野草丛生，影响道床排水，容易腐蚀枕木。应立即注意除草工作。二、从南口到青龙桥段大部道钉浮起，此段线路绕山钻洞，崎岖不平，线路坡度比全国任何铁路坡度要高，这样会妨害行车的安全。三、枕木百分之六十腐朽中断。车站内土沙堆积，埋住了枕木，这是枕木损坏快的主要原因。四、对机车的爱护与车站卫生工作注意不够，机车好久就没有擦过。另外该段副段长及工务员对该段每台机车平均日行多少公里亦答不出来，这说明南口机务段“贯彻负责制”是不够认真的，并且缺乏计划性。南口及青龙桥铁路段负责同志应即注意养路工作与纠正工作不深入的作风。
