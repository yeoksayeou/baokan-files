Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 17th: Two Japanese POWs who were retained by the Chiang bandit gang to continue slaughtering the Chinese people were discovered by the People's Liberation Army among the captives of the annihilated Chiang bandit 51st Army in Shanghai. One is Fujimoto Takao, who changed his name to Teng Xiaoxian, from Kori County, Japan, 31 years old. In 1942, he invaded China with the Japanese invaders and committed all kinds of evil deeds, including rape, arson, and murder, in Jinan and other places. After the Japanese invaders surrendered in 1945, he was retained by the Kuomintang 20th Army Group. He was captured by us in Yanzhou, Shandong, in July of the same year, educated, and released to return to his country. However, after arriving in Shanghai, he was again retained by the Kuomintang bandit army 51st Army, serving as the adjutant of the 338th Regiment Infantry Training Class. He was captured for the second time in the Bailonggang battle in Shanghai. The other is Shimazaki Kaoru, who changed his name to Tang Mingguang, from Osaka City, Japan, 30 years old, a graduate of the Sendai Military Academy in Japan. He invaded China in 1941 and successively slaughtered the Chinese people in Taiyuan, Shijiazhuang, and other places. After the Japanese invaders surrendered, he was retained by the Kuomintang bandit army, serving as an instructor in the Infantry Department of the Military Training Brigade of the Bandit Army 12th Army, an instructor in the Tactical Research Class of the same army, and an instructor in the Training Class of the 115th Regiment. He was captured by us in Yanzhou last June, and later fled to Shanghai, serving as an instructor in the Military Brigade of the Bandit Army 51st Army, an instructor in the Infantry Department of the Training Class, and a deputy education adjutant of the Transportation Regiment. He was captured again by us in the Bailonggang battle.
