　　Japanese People Oppose Government Layoffs
  　Tokyo Electric Railway Workers Strike
    30,000 Workers and Students Demonstrate Against "New Public Security Law"
    Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 12th: Reports from various sources: The five-day strike of Tokyo streetcar workers has just ended, and workers on most electric railway lines in Kanagawa and Tokyo prefectures successively began strikes on the 9th and 10th. The strikes are in opposition to the newly announced work schedule, according to which 60,000 people will be laid off from the electric railway lines in the Tokyo area. According to an AFP dispatch on the 10th, this electric railway strike may be a prelude to a large-scale strike by Japanese workers against the government's layoff plan. MacArthur Headquarters was very alarmed by this strike and summoned strike leaders on the morning of the 10th, ordering them to immediately stop the strike.
    Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 12th: Tokyo News: 30,000 workers and students in Tokyo held their third demonstration against the so-called "New Public Security Law" on the 11th. This "New Public Security Law," which is currently being drafted, brutally restricts the rights of the Japanese people to demonstrate and hold public gatherings. Demonstrators waved red flags along the way, sang the Internationale, and carried various banners, depicting Yoshida as the chief culprit threatening the freedom and independence of the Japanese people. The demonstrators passed the mortuary where streetcar worker Hashimoto Kinjiro lay in state, paying grief-stricken tribute to the deceased. Hashimoto was kidnapped by the police on May 29th during the first Tokyo anti-"New Public Security Law" demonstration, thrown from the fourth floor of a building, and killed.

　　日本人民反对政府裁员
  　东京电气铁道工人罢工
    三万工人学生示威反对“新治安法”
    【新华社北平十二日电】各方报道：日本东京市电车工人的五天罢工刚刚结束，神奈川县与东京县大部分电气铁道干线的工人，又先后于九日及十日开始罢工。罢工是为了反对新公布的工作日程表，依照这一日程，东京区各电气铁道干线上将有六万人被裁减。据法新社十日电称，这次电气铁道罢工，可能成为日本劳工反对政府裁员计划的大规模罢工的前奏。麦克阿瑟总部对于这一罢工甚为恐慌，并于十日晨召集罢工领袖，命令他们立即停止罢工。
    【新华社北平十二日电】东京消息：东京市工人与学生三万人，于十一日举行第三次反对所谓“新治安法”的示威。这个正在拟制中的“新治安法”，横暴地限制日本人民示威与公共集会的权利。示威者沿途挥舞红旗，高唱国际歌，打着各种旗帜，描绘吉田为威胁日本人民自由与独立的魁首。示威者走过电车工人桥本金次郎的停殡处，向死者悲愤地致哀。桥本是在五月二十九日东京第一次反“新治安法”示威中，被警察绑至四层楼上掷下摔死的。
