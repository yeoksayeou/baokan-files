    VI. Becoming a Glorious Member of the Communist Youth League
    In the initial stage of enrollment, the students had many incorrect and inaccurate views about the Communist Party and the New Democratic Youth League. They also did not understand the essential difference between the Youth League and the Kuomintang's Three People's Principles Youth League. For example, some people held aloof and superior ideas of being above class and party affiliation. Some thought that the League members' leading role in study, life, and labor was deliberately contrived. Others said, "Anyway, I serve the people, why should I join any party or league?" However, after more than two months of study, the students' awareness has generally improved. In particular, after listening to Comrades Feng Wenbin and Lu Ping's reports on the establishment of the League at the school, everyone had a further understanding of the Youth League. Therefore, many students have applied to join the Youth League. Some students, in order to strive to join the League as soon as possible, are very serious in their studies, taking advantage of their rest time to copy notes, and sincerely examine themselves and accept criticism from others. You can often hear: "Am I good enough to meet the requirements for joining the League? What's not good enough? Please point it out to me so I can correct it." The school Party Committee decided to absorb a large number of advanced young activists into the League in a planned and step-by-step manner. The school headquarters and the school League Preparatory Committee have started working on May 15th. Branches and departments have also set up League committees, and each class has established a League branch committee. Currently, statistics from the first, second, third, and fourth departments show that more than 3,000 students have applied to join the League. Fifty-seven original members of the Minqing and Minlian in the second, third, and fourth departments have all requested to become members of the Youth League. Many other students are preparing to apply. Everyone hopes to be a glorious member of the Youth League. The school held the first batch of 634 people into the League ceremony on June 12, and the Central Committee of the League sent representatives to supervise the oath.
    VII. Pleasant Life, Free Learning
    The meals are managed democratically, with students electing their own food committee. Due to effective management, living conditions have improved. Generally, they can eat a fine grain meal every two days, and meat twice a week. The students are very satisfied.
    Under the leadership of the school affairs office, a cooperative has been established, with a shop selling food materials, stationery, paper, and daily necessities at low prices. The barbershop charges cadres and students only a small fee for haircuts. There are also economical canteens and cold food departments, all for the convenience of the workers and students. In addition, the school also has a special women's work committee, composed of the school's women cadres, which specializes in studying and appropriately solving various problems of female students in life and study. The female students' dormitories are neat and clean, and in some places even better than the male students' dormitories.
    Each class's club is organized by the students themselves, specializing in leading various extracurricular cultural and recreational activities, such as drama, singing, yangko dance, basketball and volleyball teams, etc. Every day after dinner until eight o'clock, the middle two hours are free time. Groups of three or five male and female students happily walk to the fields with hoes and shovels; on the thirty or forty basketball and volleyball courts, many people are happily exercising, some are practicing singing, and the clubs are full of people; the sound of games, singing, and gongs and drums can be heard everywhere. At the Revolutionary University, this group of young people full of revolutionary enthusiasm and vigor are spending their study life in a free and pleasant atmosphere.
    VIII. Conclusion
    The first part of the school's curriculum, the basic theory of Marxism-Leninism, has been completed, and tests, democratic grading, and individual ideological summaries are now being held. After mobilization by the general assembly of all party members and youth league members, the assembly of learning representatives and activists, and the women's congress, the movement has been launched and is expected to end within a week. The purpose of the test summary is threefold: first, to affirm and consolidate the achievements made; second, to expand the results so that each student can improve their understanding and thought in this test summary; and third, to summarize the teaching experience. It is now being carried out intensely, and it is estimated that this test summary will achieve more satisfactory results than the last time.

    六、作一个光荣的青年团员
    学员在入学初期，对于共产党和新民主主义青年团，有许多错误的和不正确的看法，对于青年团和国民党的三青团的本质区别也闹不清楚，如象有人脑子里抱着超阶级超党派的清高思想，有人认为团员在学习生活和劳作上的带头是故意做作，还有人说：“反正我为人民服务，何必参加什么党团呢？”但是经过两个多月的学习，学员的觉悟程度已普遍的提高，尤其听了冯文彬和陆平同志在学校关于建团的报告后，大家对于青年团有了进一步的认识。因此许多学员便纷纷提出要求加入青年团。有些同学为争取早日入团，在学习方面很认真，利用休息时间赶抄笔记，并诚恳地检讨自己接受他人的批评，经常可以听到：“我够不够入团条件？哪点不够？请给我指出，我好改正”。校党委会决定有计划有步骤地吸收大批先进青年积极分子入团，校部校团筹委会已于五月十五日开始办公，分校及各部亦设立团委会，各班建立团支委会，现在一、二、三、四各部统计已有学员三千多申请入团，二、三、四部原民青民联盟员五十七人，全部要求转为青年团员。还有许多同学正在准备申请。大家都希望作一个光荣的青年团员，学校已于六月十二日举行了第一批六百三十四人入团仪式，团中央并派代表前来监誓。
    七、愉快的生活，自由的学习
    伙食是采取民主管理的方式，由同学们自己选举伙食委员会，由于管理得法，生活均得到改善，一般每两天可以吃到一顿细粮，每星期吃到两次肉，同学们均甚满意。
    在校务处的领导下，成立了合作社，下设门市部，廉价出卖伙食资料、文具纸张、生活用品。理发所，干部学员只需付出少数费用便可理发。还有经济食堂与冷食部，都是为了学工人员的方便。此外学校还专门组织有女生工作委员会，由学校的妇女干部组成，专门研究并适当解决女生在生活学习上的各种问题，女生宿舍都很整齐清洁，有些地方比男生宿舍还要好。
    每班的俱乐部都是同学自己组织的，专门领导各种课外文化娱乐活动，如戏剧、歌咏、秧歌舞、篮排球队等。每天晚饭后到八点钟，中间二个多钟点是自由活动时间，三五一群的男女同学拿着锄头铲子、愉快地向田里走去；三四十个篮排球场上，许多人在高兴地运动着，有的则在练唱歌，俱乐部里更是人堆得满满的；作游戏唱歌锣鼓之声随处可以听到。革命大学里，这一群充满革命热情、朝气蓬勃的青年，在自由愉快的气氛中渡着他们的学习生活。
    八、结语
    学校之第一部份课程马列主义基本理论，学习已经完毕，现正在举行测验、民主评卷及各个人的思想总结，经过全体党员青年团员大会、学习代表积极分子大会、妇女大会，先后进行了动员，运动已经展开，准备一礼拜内结束，测验总结目的有三：第一肯定和巩固已得成绩。第二扩大战果，使每一学员能在这一测验总结中提高认识提高思想。第三总结教学经验。现正在紧张的进行中，估计这次测验总结比上次定会取得更圆满的收获。
