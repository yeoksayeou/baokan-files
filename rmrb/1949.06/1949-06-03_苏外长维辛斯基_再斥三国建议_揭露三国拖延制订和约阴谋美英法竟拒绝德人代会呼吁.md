Xinhua News Agency, Peiping, June 2nd: According to TASS, Paris: On May 31st, the four foreign ministers held the second meeting of the second week, chaired by US Secretary of State Acheson, and continued to discuss the first item on the agenda: the issue of German unification.

　　Vyshinsky spoke first, again rejecting the proposals on the issue of German unification put forward by the three Western countries, and reiterated that this proposal was unacceptable.

　　Vyshinsky, in discussing the Western countries' suggestion to extend the so-called occupation statutes to all of Germany, stated that the intention of this proposal was to continue to delay the drafting and conclusion of a peace treaty with Germany and to extend the occupation system indefinitely. The proposal for occupation statutes obviously has other purposes as well. It is also used to consolidate the dismemberment of Germany, a dismemberment that is the result of the actions of the US, Britain, and France, who have been carrying out this activity in West Germany since 1946, especially in the last eighteen months. Vyshinsky listed a series of facts illustrating the Western countries' division of Germany. Vyshinsky said that the facts show that the destruction of the foundation of four-power joint control was primarily caused by the implementation of the three countries' separatist actions. The meaning of the French proverb quoted by Acheson, these facts can serve as eloquent examples. That proverb in Russian is "putting the cart before the horse." This is not saying that people are narrating facts in their original order, but rather narrating them arbitrarily according to their own wishes.

　　Vyshinsky then criticized another proposal by the Western countries, which stated that decisions in the four-power control agency (High Commission) should not be passed according to the principle of unanimous agreement, but by majority vote. Vyshinsky said that this principle is not suitable for solving international problems, because at the international round table, at the round table of the Control Commission, sit the representatives of countries with equal sovereignty, and to adopt a decision violating the will of a certain country means attempting to implement a dictatorial method. Vyshinsky emphasized that opponents of the principle of unanimous agreement are trying to maintain their decisive say in any case, and are not even satisfied with the method of majority voting. Vyshinsky recalled that Section 5 of the Washington Three-Power Control Agreement stipulated that in certain circumstances, voting in the Three-Power Control Agency should be proportional to the total amount of money given by foreign countries to the German government. In addition, this section also made the following reservation: that in certain circumstances the United States will have the decisive vote, regardless of the circumstances. Vyshinsky said that this voting method is not only dictatorial, but also a form of financial dictatorship. This is not majority vote and unanimous agreement, but one-man rule.

　　Vyshinsky concluded by saying that from the standpoint of the Potsdam Agreement, democratic principles, the interests of the German people, and the interests of building peace between Germany and the whole of Europe, the proposals of the US, British, and French representatives on the issue of German unification are unacceptable. The Soviet delegation cannot accept these proposals; it can neither agree to them as a whole, nor can it agree to any point in the proposal individually. What is at stake here is not a detail, but a major aspect. Therefore, we reject these proposals. Moreover, we have to say that these proposals are out of an intention to impose the will of the three countries on the fourth country, an intention to reject any practically feasible way to restore German unification in order to determine the dismemberment of Germany. These proposals cannot but be considered the completion of the Western countries' separatist activities in Germany, the logical consequence of the systematic sabotage of the principles of the Potsdam Agreement by the US, Britain, and France.

　　Acheson and Bevin did not express any opinion or objection to Vyshinsky's speech. Schuman attempted to briefly reply to the Soviet Foreign Minister's speech, but did not put forward any new arguments to defend the US, British, and French proposals.

　　At the end of the meeting, Vyshinsky asked: The secretariat of the Foreign Ministers' meeting has distributed the appeal of the Third German People's Congress to the delegations. When will the Foreign Ministers' meeting consider this event? This document states that the Third German People's Congress, with the participation of more than 2,000 representatives elected from all over Germany, has elected a delegation from the representatives of various democratic parties in Germany, and this delegation is willing to express the German people's opinions on the conclusion of a peace treaty with Germany. However, this appeal was rejected by Schuman, Acheson, and Bevin.

　　苏外长维辛斯基
  　再斥三国建议
  　揭露三国拖延制订和约阴谋美英法竟拒绝德人代会呼吁
    【新华社北平二日电】据塔斯社巴黎讯：五月卅一日，四国外长举行第二周的第二次会议，由美国务卿艾奇逊任主席，继续讨论第一项议程：德国统一问题。
    维辛斯基首先发言，他再度驳斥三西方国家关于德国统一问题提出的建议，并重申这一建议是不能接受的。
    维辛斯基论述西方国家将所谓占领法规扩大施用于全德国的建议称：这一建议的用意，是在继续拖延制订与缔结对德和约，并将占领制度无限期地延长。占领法规的建议，显然也还有其他的目的。它又是用来巩固德国的肢解状态的，这种肢解状态是美、英、法活动的结果，他们自一九四六年以来就在西德进行这种活动，特别是在最近十八个月中间。维辛斯基列举了一系列的事实，说明西方国家分裂德国的情形。维辛斯基说，事实表明，首先是因为实行了三国的分裂行动，从而造成了四国共管基础的破坏。艾奇逊所引法国谚话的涵义，这些事实可以作为雄辩的实例。那句谚语用俄国话说就是“把车放在牛的前面”。这句话不是说人们按照本来的顺序叙述事实，而是按照自己的愿望随意叙述。
    维辛斯基继而批评西方国家的另一建议，该建议说，四国管制机构（高级委员会）中的决定，不应按照全体一致协议的原则通过，而是以多数通过。维辛斯基说，这个原则不适合于解决国际问题，因为在国际事务的圆桌上，在管制委员会的圆桌上，坐的是有平等主权的国家的代表，违反着某个国家对某个决定的意志而采取这个决定，这意味着企图实施独裁的方法。维辛斯基强调称，全体一致协议原则的反对者，力图在任何情况下保持自己有决定性的发言权，甚至连对多数表决的方法也是不满足的。维辛斯基回溯，华盛顿三国管制协议第五节中规定，在某些情况下，三国管制机构中应按外国给予德国政府的金钱的总数为比例而进行表决。此外，这一节还作了如下保留，即在某些场合下美国将有决定权，不管当时的情况如何。维辛斯基说，这种表决方式不仅是独裁，而且还是某种形式的财政独裁。这不是多数表决和一致协议，而是一人专断。
    维辛斯基的结语说，从波茨坦协议、从民主原则、从德国人民的利益以及德国与整个欧洲的缔建和平的利益的观点出发，美英法代表关于德国统一问题的建议是无法接受的。苏联代表团不能接受这些建议，它既不能整个地同意这些建议，也不能个别地同意该建议中的任何一点。这里所关系到的不是细节，而是主要方面。因此，我们拒绝这些建议。而且，我们不得不说，这些建议是出于意图将三国的意志强加于第四国，意图拒绝任何实际可行的恢复德国统一的办法来确定德国的肢解。这些建议不能不认为是西方国家在德国的分裂活动的完成，是美英法有系统地破坏波茨坦协议之原则的逻辑的后果。
    艾奇逊和贝文对维辛斯基的发言未表示任何意见或反对。舒曼试图简短答复苏联外长的演说，但未提出为美英法建议辩护的任何新论据。
    在会议结束时，维辛斯基发问：外长会议秘书处已在代表团中分发了第三届德国人民代表大会的呼吁，外长会议将在何时考虑这个事件？这个文件说，有全德选出的二千余代表参加的第三届德国人民代表大会，已自德国各民主党派的代表中选出代表团，这一代表团愿意表示德国人民对于对德缔和的意见。可是，这一呼吁为舒曼、艾奇逊和贝文所拒绝。
