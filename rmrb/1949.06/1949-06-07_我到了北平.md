　　I Arrived in Beiping
    Gu Zhizhong
    After the Japanese surrender, I refused to work for the Shanghai News, which had been seized by the CC clique. For the sake of the Minzhi News School, which we had run in Shanghai and Chongqing for over twenty years, consistently upholding progressive political views, supporting democracy, and opposing world war, I and several friends engaged in journalism and education had long been regarded as thorns in the side by the secret agents of Nanjing and Shanghai, who were determined to get rid of us.
    Since last winter, according to reports from friends in relevant departments, my name and the names of several friends had been placed on the secret agents' blacklist. By the end of March this year, before the People's Liberation Army crossed the Yangtze River, the political situation in Shanghai had further deteriorated. Several democratic人士 (ren shi - public figures) who remained in Shanghai could no longer live peacefully at home, but had to take turns staying in places they considered secret each night. My situation was even more dangerous. Therefore, I had to accept the advice of friends and secretly escape to Hong Kong by boat at the end of March.
    I stayed in Hong Kong for more than a month, intending to return via the sea route as soon as Shanghai was liberated. However, by the end of April, I saw that the resolution of Shanghai was stuck in a "dragging" situation. I then hastily decided to leave Hong Kong and come north. I firmly believed that I could learn and understand many new things in Beiping and Tianjin, and that staying idle in Hong Kong was meaningless. Secondly, I could take the Jinpu Railway from Tianjin back to Nanjing and Shanghai. After a long journey through the new, free, and liberated areas, I would surely be more effective when I returned to work in Shanghai.
    I freely bought a boat ticket in Hong Kong, without any restrictions. On the morning of May 6th at five o'clock, the Yuezhou ship, with only over two thousand tons, sailed. On the 11th, it arrived in Incheon, Korea, and on the evening of the 13th, it arrived in Tianjin. The journey was marked by strong winds, heavy rain, large waves, great heat, and great cold, which made the approximately four hundred Chinese passengers crammed into the steerage suffer unspeakably. But on the morning of the 13th, when we saw the yellow seawater outside Tanggu Port, knowing that we were very close to the border of the free and democratic New China, everyone was immediately exceptionally excited, rolling up bedding, dismantling canvas beds, packing luggage, and opening their mouths, preparing to breathe desperately in this fresh air, air so fresh that they had never encountered it before.
    At half past nine on the evening of May 13th, the Yuezhou ship docked at the shore of Zizhu Forest in Tianjin. Passengers who had their affairs handled through the Hong Kong China Merchants' Daily were allowed to disembark that night. Other passengers had to stay on the ship for another night and were only allowed to go ashore the next morning after the police authorities and customs officers had questioned their identities and inspected their luggage. Before leaving Hong Kong, I had Mr. Lu Yi of the China News Agency and Mr. Shao Zonghan of the China Merchants' Daily send a telegram to the north on my behalf, requesting Mr. Qiao Mu to explain my identity. However, the Tianjin side had not received Mr. Qiao Mu's telegram that night and did not allow me to disembark that evening. Seeing this new free and democratic land but not being able to go up immediately, I was naturally very frustrated. Not only me, but also the other two hundred or so passengers hated that they could not sleep on the new liberated, free, and democratic land that night, and still had to sleep on the Yuezhou ship flying the British imperial flag. This is very natural human nature, but very few of the large group of passengers who were allowed to disembark first that night could appreciate it.
    At eight o'clock on the morning of the 14th, the inspection authorities allowed us and our luggage to leave the Yuezhou ship. The luggage of each family of passengers was neatly arranged in three long rows on the dock. First, identities were questioned, and then luggage was inspected. The people carrying out the procedure were very polite, considerate, and reasonable, not casual, nor deliberately creating difficulties. We were all very satisfied. However, the procedures for exchanging foreign currency at the Bank of China on the dock seemed too slow. Each passenger had to wait for at least one or two hours under the strong, unshaded sunlight. Of course, they did not know that we had so many passengers coming, otherwise they would have prepared properly.
    After staying in Tianjin for a day, I came to Beiping. Today I have been working for more than ten days, living on this free and democratic land. Now I want to tell readers my feelings and what I have seen in these ten days.
    First of all, I feel that the public security here is very good. In the Jiang-controlled area, there was a curfew at 11 o'clock at night, and people were arrested late at night. The people's movements and residence were not free. Even in Hong Kong, which British imperialism thought was very well governed, there were robberies every day. But in the more than ten days that I have been here, the roads have not been blocked due to any incident and there has been no temporary declaration of curfew. I sleep peacefully at night. Even in the hotel, there are no more police knocking on the door to interrogate sleepy-eyed travelers as before.
    The financial situation is relatively stable, simply incomparable to Shanghai. Even a month or two ago, prices in Shanghai would jump several times a day, but in the ten days or so that I have been here, hotel room rates and rickshaw fares, etc., have not increased. Meals have only recently increased by ten yuan. And in Hong Kong, the Hong Kong dollar has depreciated from five yuan one jiao per US dollar to six yuan one jiao, and rice and other items have also increased in price. Generally, Hong Kong is regarded as a paradise, but few know that the price increases in this paradise have already surpassed ours. We believe that our current economic situation is not a cause for concern. The liberation of all of China is not far away, and the stability of our entire financial system will be achieved quickly!
    The freedom of visitors shatters all the rumors in Hong Kong. Hong Kong spread rumors that not only did the peace representatives in Beiping have no freedom, but also some democratic人士 (ren shi - public figures) had considerable unfreedom. But after I came here, I have seen my old friends such as Shen Junru, Huang Yanpei, Tan Pingshan, Zhou Xinmin, Hu Yuzhi, Zhu Xuefan, Xin Zhichao, Shen Tilan, and Sa Kongliao. On May 20th, I met with Mr. Shao Lizi, and on the afternoon of the 23rd, I met with Mr. Zhang Zhizhong. In the Beijing Hotel where Mr. Shen and Mr. Shao and other gentlemen lived, there were still regulations on visiting hours and procedures for filling out visitor slips, while in another place where Mr. Zhang Zhizhong lived, there were neither time regulations nor the need to fill out visitor slips. As long as Mr. Zhang was willing to meet, everything was fine. I can personally prove the freedom that we all have here. The rumors in Hong Kong and the nonsense of Hu Shi have been shattered by these facts.
    In addition, I met and talked with the common people, workers, merchants, and even Christian pastors and American expatriates remaining in Beiping. They all unanimously praised the new People's Democratic Government, saying that it was hundreds of times better than the old one. Since the liberation of Beiping, they have not encountered any disturbances. They are now living a truly human life in peace, tranquility, happiness, and freedom. They all thoroughly understand that the new government is striving to improve, and that under the leadership of the CCP, the new China will become as prosperous and strong as the Soviet Union in the next few years.
    What I have said above are all facts that I have personally learned and experienced. I am now studying many issues related to the future of the news industry. I hope that I will soon be able to return to my familiar Shanghai and contribute all my small strength to the People's Democratic Government that we cherish.

### 我到了北平

　　我到了北平
    顾执中
    为了日寇投降后，我不肯参加给ＣＣ所抢去的上海新闻报工作。为了我们二十余年来在上海重庆所办的民治新闻专校，始终站在进步的政治观点，拥护民主，反对世界战争，我和若干从事于新闻及教育的朋友，便久为南京上海的特务，视为眼中之钉，欲得之而甘心。
    从去冬起，我和若干朋友的姓名，据有关方面朋友的报告，已放在特务的黑名单之中，到本年三月底，在解放军未渡江之前，上海的政治形势，更为恶化，留在上海的若干民主人士，已不能安心地住在家里，而是每晚轮流地住在各自以为秘密的地方，我的情形，更为险恶。因此，我不得不接受朋友的忠告，在三月底由上海乘轮秘密逃至香港。
    在港住了一个多月，满拟一俟上海解放，就从香港再经海道回去，但到四月底，我一看上海的解决，已陷于“拖”的形势，我便临时匆促地决定离港北来，我坚决地相信我可在平津学习到和了解到许多新的东西，而在香港的闲住，是没有意义的，其次我可从平津乘津浦路返京沪，在新的自由的解放区域，经过了长距离旅行以后，我一旦回沪工作的时候，必然会有较好的效能。
    在港自由地买了船票，毫无限制。五月六日早上五点钟，只有二千余吨的岳州轮驶行了。十一日到了朝鲜的仁川，十三日晚到了天津，途中有大风大雨大浪大热大冷，使全部挤在统舱的四百左右的中国旅客，困苦不堪，但当十三日的早上，看见了塘沽口外的黄黄海水，知道离开了自由民主的新中国的边岸，已是很近，大家一时都精神异常奋兴，卷铺盖，拆帆布床，收拾行李，彼此张着口，准备在这新鲜的空气里，从来没有遇到象这样新鲜的空气里，拼命的呼吸。
    五月十三日晚九时半，岳州轮傍着天津紫竹林的岸，旅客中由港华商报经手办理的，当晚即行上岸，其他旅客，则须再在船上留宿一宵，到翌晨由警察当局及海关人员询问身份和查验行李后，方准上去，我在香港临行前，曾由国新社陆诒，华商报邵宗汉两先生，代请乔木先生致电北方说明我的身份，但那晚天津方面，还没有收到乔木先生的电报，不准我在当晚上岸，我眼见这块新的自由民主的大地，而不能立即上去，心中自然非常懊丧，不特是我，其余二百多旅客，也是以那天晚上不能睡在新的解放的自由民主的土地，而依然还要睡在那扯着大英帝国旗帜的岳州轮上为恨，这是很自然的人性，可是那晚一大群得到先行上岸的旅客们，很少能体会得到的。
    十四日早上八时，检查当局准许我们本身和行李，离开岳州轮，一家旅客的行李，在码头上很有秩序的排成长长的三排，首先询问身份，随即检查行李，执行的人都非常有礼貌周到而合理，不随便，也不故意为难，我们都非常满意，不过中国银行在码头上办理兑换外币的手续，似乎太慢些，每一旅客在强烈的无遮蔽的阳光之下，至少要等一二小时之久，当然他们没有知道我们有这许多旅客来，否则他们也会好好的预备的。
    在津住一天后，即来北平，到今天我已有十多天的工作，在这自由民主的大地上生活着，我现在要把在这十多天中的感想和看到的事情，告诉读者。
    首先我所感觉得到这里的治安，非常良好，在蒋管区晚上十一时即戒严，深夜捕人，人民的行动和居住，没有自由，甚至英帝国主义以为统治得非常有成绩的香港，也天天闹着抢劫。而我到这里的十多天中，道路上并没有因任何事情而断绝交通临时宣告戒严，晚上安安的睡着。甚至在旅馆中，也没有从前那样的警察敲开房间来盘诘睡眼惺忪的旅客。
    金融比较的稳定，简直和上海不能比较，即在一二个月前，上海的物价，一天要跳好几次，而我到这里十几天中，旅馆房租和车力等，都没有涨，客饭在新近只涨了十元，而在香港呢，港币从每一美钞的五元一角，贬值至六元一角，食米等也都上涨，一般都视香港为天堂，不知这个天堂的物价上涨，有的已在我们之上，我们相信目前我们的经济情形，是不足为忧的，全中国的解放不远，我们整个金融的稳定也很快了！
    访客的自由，粉碎了香港一切的谣言。香港谣传着不特和平代表在平没有自由，就是若干民主人士，也有相当不自由。可是我到这里后，我已看见了沈钧儒黄炎培谭平山周新民胡愈之朱学范辛志超沈体兰萨空了等诸位老友。五月二十日，我晤见了邵力子先生，二十三日下午我晤见了张治中先生，在沈邵诸先生所住的北京饭店，尚有会客时间的规定和填写会客单等手续，而张治中先生所住另一地方，既无时间上的规定，也不须填写会客单，只要张先生肯会见，一切没有问题。我亲身可以证明着我们人人在这里所有的自由，香港的谣言，胡适的谰言，都给这些事实打得稀烂。
    此外，我和北平的老百姓，工友商人，甚至基督教牧师和留平的美国侨民，见面谈论他们都一致的赞美着新的人民民主政府，比旧的不知要好几百倍。他们从北平解放以来，并没有遭逢到任何的骚扰，他们现在都在平安恬静快活和自由之下，过着真的人类的生活，他们都彻底的明了新政府力图向上，新中国在中共领导之下在以后短短的几年中，就会象苏联那样地康乐富强起来。
    以上我所讲的，都是我亲身所学习到、体验到的事实。我现在正在研究有关于未来新闻事业的许多问题。我希望我不久能回到我所熟悉的上海，把我所有的一些小小的力量，贡献于我们所爱护的人民民主政府。
