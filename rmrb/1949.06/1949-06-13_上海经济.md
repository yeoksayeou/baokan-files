Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 12th:

　　Shanghai Economy
    (1) The Shanghai Foreign Exchange, formerly of the Bank of China which has been taken over, officially opened on the 10th to promote foreign trade, facilitate overseas remittances, and prevent speculation. The opening day went well. The opening price for US dollars was 1,800 RMB per dollar. Because this price was fair and reasonable, merchants and citizens lined up in the street to sell foreign currency to the exchange. Ji Chaoding, First Deputy General Manager and Manager of the International Department of the Bank of China, is guiding the exchange's operations. Twenty banks, including Xinhua, Jin Cheng, Da Tong, Moscow, HSBC, and Citibank, have been designated and approved as traders at the exchange.
    (2) The Military Control Commission issued a notice on the 8th setting a deadline for the exchange and deposit of foreign currency and reiterated that foreign currency is strictly prohibited from circulating in the market. Merchants and citizens holding foreign currency must, within half a month of the establishment of the foreign exchange, exchange it for RMB at the Bank of China at the listed price or deposit it in the bank to obtain a deposit certificate. These foreign currency deposit certificates can be freely traded at designated foreign exchange.
    (3) The cash deposits and reserves of commercial banks, money shops, trust companies, etc., formerly held in the puppet Central Bank, were refunded in full in RMB by the Shanghai branch of the Bank of China on the 7th. The portion belonging to securities is mostly US dollar bonds issued by the puppet Central Bank. How to dispose of these will be decided in the short term.
    (4) The Military Control Commission has decided to temporarily exempt cotton import duties to develop production and strengthen foreign trade.
    (5) Since the opening of the Bank of China in Shanghai on the 6th, more than 300 new accounts have been opened. The foreign exchange deposit certificate exchange and value-guaranteed savings, two important businesses, will be opened in the short term.
    (6) The Trade Department of the Financial and Economic Takeover Committee of the Military Control Commission has recently seized part of the materials belonging to the Yangzi Jianye Company of the Kong Xiangxi faction (about one-third of which had fled to Taiwan, Guangzhou and other places before the liberation), and 2,882 auto parts stored by the Chiang Kai-shek bandit's Joint Logistics Headquarters under the name of "Xinji Company" in the Mao Tai Enterprise Co., Ltd., which will be confiscated.

　　上海经济
    （一）已被接管的中国银行上海外汇交易所已于十日起正式开业，借以推进国外贸易，便利侨汇，并防止投机。开业第一天情形良好，美钞开盘为一元合人民币一千八百元。由于这一价格公平合理，商人和市民前往该所出售外币的队伍，一直排列至马路上。该所业务由中国银行总管理处第一副总经理兼国外部经理冀朝鼎指导，经指定、核准为该所交易员的银行，已有新华、金城、大通、莫斯科、汇丰、花旗等二十家。
    （二）军管会于八日布告限期收兑与收存外币，并重申严禁外币在市场流通。凡持有外币的商民人等，限于外汇交易所成立后半个月内，向中国银行按牌价兑换人民币或存入该行取得存单。此种外币存单可向指定的外汇交易所自由交易。
    （三）沪市各商业银行、钱庄、信托公司等前存于伪中央银行的存款和准备金，其属于现金者，已于七日由中国银行上海分行折合人民币如数发还。其属于有价证券部分，大多为伪中央银行所发之美金公债券，如何处置，短期内亦可决定。
    （四）军管会顷决定暂免征收棉花进口税，以发展生产和加强对外贸易。
    （五）沪市中国银行自六日开业后。存款业务新开立之存户即达三百余户。外汇存单交易所及折实储蓄两项重要业务短期内即可开办。
