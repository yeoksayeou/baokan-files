　　Beijing Gold and Silver Jewelry Stores
    Mostly Switch to Other Businesses

    [Report from this newspaper] Accepting the advice of the People's Government, most gold and silver jewelry stores in Beijing have switched to other businesses by early June. A small number have reported closures. The business of many gold stores after switching industries is very different from the situation of passively waiting for customers when selling gold and silver jewelry in the past few months. For example, Tianxing and Zhengfeng, two stores in the first alley of Qianmenwai Langfang, have switched to operating state-owned cloth stores, and can sell an average of 50,000 to 60,000 yuan a day. Wuhua Gold Store has switched to operating a tea shop. The owner and employees work hard together, and the daily turnover is 40,000 to 50,000 yuan, which is no weaker than the famous old tea shops. Hongfeng Gold Store has switched to operating a stationery store, and income is also increasing day by day. (Zhong)

　　平市金银首饰店
    转营他业买卖多
    【本报讯】平市金银首饰业接受人民政府劝告，大多数已在六月初转业，一小部分呈报歇业，许多金店转业后的买卖，比起前几个月做金银首饰买卖守株待兔的情形，已大不同。前外廊房头条天兴、正丰两家改营国布庄，平均一天可以卖五、六万元。物华金店改营茶叶店，掌柜店员一起苦干，每天流水四、五万元，买卖不弱于一般有名的老茶叶铺。宏丰金店改营文具店，收入也在一天天增加。    （仲）
