　　Xinhua News Agency, Prague, June 6th: The news of Shanghai's liberation, in the newspapers of many European countries, whether progressive or reactionary, has been the most eye-catching of the many headline titles since the Chinese People's Liberation Army crossed the Yangtze River.

　　On May 26th, the French Communist Party's L'Humanité published a photograph of Chairman Mao Zedong and Commander-in-Chief Zhu De on the front page, along with an editorial by the newspaper's director, Marcel Cachin, praising Shanghai's liberation as "one of the most important events in modern history. Its impact will determine the future of humanity." It also said: "Since the Red Army occupied Berlin, there has been no event in the history of warfare that can be compared to the victory of the Chinese People's Liberation Army and that is worthy of special mention." Before the editorial, Cachin first quoted Chairman Mao Zedong's words in "On the Current Situation and Our Tasks": "As long as we can master the science of Marxism-Leninism, trust the masses, ... lead them forward, ... our strength is invincible."

    【新华社布拉格六日电】上海解放的消息，在欧洲许多国家不论进步或反动的报纸上，是中国人民解放军渡过长江以来多次头条标题中最引人注目的一次。
    五月二十六日，法共人道报，在第一版刊载毛泽东主席与朱德总司令的像片，并有该报社长加善所作的社论，称颂上海解放为“现代史上一件最重要的大事。它的影响，将决定人类的前途”。并说：“从红军占领柏林以来，战争史上没有一件足以与中国人民解放军这个胜利相比拟和值得大书特书的”。在社论的前面，加善首先摘引了毛泽东主席“论目前形势和我们的任务”中的话：“只要我们能够掌握马克思列宁主义的科学，信任群众，……领导他们前进，……我们的力量是无敌的”。
