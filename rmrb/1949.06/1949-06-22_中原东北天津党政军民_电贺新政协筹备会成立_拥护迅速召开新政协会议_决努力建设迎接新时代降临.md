Xinhua News Agency, Hankou, 21st: The Central Plains Temporary People's Government, the Central China Bureau of the CPC Central Committee, the Fourth Field Army of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, and the Central China Military Region of the Chinese People's Liberation Army jointly telegraphed congratulations on the convening of the New CPPCC Preparatory Committee on the 20th. They pointed out: The history of the past two decades proves that under the leadership of the proletarian political party, the Chinese Communist Party, the Chinese people can not only defeat any counter-revolutionary evil forces, but also have the ability and means to build their own country. This conference is a major milestone in our nation-building work. This sacred work represents the will and strength of the people of the whole country and has also won the enthusiastic support of the people of the whole country. In addition, the Wuhan Military Control Commission, the Wuhan Municipal People's Government, and the Wuhan Municipal Committee of the CPC also jointly telegraphed congratulations on the success of the New CPPCC Preparatory Committee, saying: This conference represents the unprecedented unity of workers, peasants, petty bourgeoisie, and liberal bourgeoisie throughout the country under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, which guarantees that we can completely and finally eliminate all counter-revolutionary forces and guarantees that the Chinese nation will smoothly embark on the road of independence, democracy, unity, and prosperity.

Xinhua News Agency, Hankou, 21st: Workers, students, democratic人士, and citizens from all walks of life in Wuhan warmly support the establishment of the New CPPCC Preparatory Committee. More than 600 employees of the Ping-Han Railway who were holding a meeting and more than 300 workers from various industries who were participating in the first worker lecture organized by the preparatory committee of the Wuhan Federation of Trade Unions burst into fervent applause immediately after hearing the news of the New CPPCC Preparatory Committee meeting. When they brought the news back to their factories, the workers said one after another: "We hope that the New CPPCC will be convened as soon as possible, and that the democratic united government representing the people will be established soon." The workers of each section of the Jiang'an factory of the Ping-Han Railway scrambled to read the newspapers containing the news of the New CPPCC Preparatory Committee and the speeches of Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu. Ma Wenkui, a worker at the Jiang'an Bridge Factory who met Chairman Mao in Chongqing in 1945, said: "I saw Chairman Mao at the entrance of the China-Soviet Cultural Association in Chongqing who was not afraid of danger and came to Chongqing to negotiate for the people. However, the resolutions of that year's Political Consultative Conference were torn up by the Kuomintang reactionaries who were bent on launching a civil war. Since then, we have been thinking that one day, Chairman Mao and the Communist Party will lead the convening of a new Political Consultative Conference, and now that day has arrived. The day when we will successfully build an independent, free, democratic, and happy New China is not far away." When the students of Wuhan University saw this news, they were all very excited. They all said that the New CPPCC and the united government must not allow Kuomintang reactionaries to participate. The newspaper reading columns on the streets of Wuhan were crowded with several times more readers than usual, reading the news of the establishment of the New CPPCC Preparatory Committee. Ma Zhemin, one of the leaders of the China Democratic League in Hankou, Hua Yuqing, the person in charge of the preparatory committee of the Hankou branch of the Democratic National Construction Association, and democratic人士 Li Fanyi and others all expressed their warm support for the New CPPCC Preparatory Committee and expressed their willingness to work under the leadership of the CPC to completely eliminate the remaining reactionary forces of the Kuomintang and build a new democratic China.

Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 21st: The Northeast Administrative Committee, the Headquarters of the Northeast Military Region of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, and the Political Department jointly sent a telegram on the 20th to celebrate the convening of the New CPPCC Preparatory Committee, stating: The people of the Northeast are now using all their strength to overcome all difficulties and engage in arduous economic construction, and are determined to realize the industrialization of the Northeast in a step-by-step manner and prepare the foundation for the national industrialization. We will celebrate the success of the New CPPCC Preparatory Committee with the achievements of the Northeast construction, wish the New CPPCC Conference a successful convening, and wish the birth of the People's Republic of China.
