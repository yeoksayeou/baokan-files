　　Protect the Property of the People's Motherland (II)
    Recently, fires and destruction have occurred successively in state-owned industrial and mining enterprises in many places. Taking Beiping as an example, not long ago, the tram factory was set on fire by special agents, destroying more than 50 trams. On May 25th, a fire occurred in the laboratory of the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant, causing huge losses to the wealth of the country. Such serious events that endanger the people's motherland should not be allowed to continue, and necessary steps must be taken quickly to eradicate them!
    Everyone knows that due to the long-term rule of imperialism, feudalism, bureaucratic capitalism, and the Kuomintang reactionaries, China's industrial foundation is very weak, and its economy is backward. As the people's democratic revolution is about to achieve nationwide victory, the most arduous and great task placed before the Chinese people is to restore and develop production, transform China from a backward agricultural country into an advanced industrial country, and embark on the road of independence, democracy, and prosperity. Under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, with the diligent efforts of the people of the whole country, coupled with other favorable factors, this ideal, cherished by many outstanding people for nearly a century, can be realized within a considerable period. But to build industry, a large amount of capital is needed. We cannot obtain it through the barbaric methods of plunder and exploitation of colonies and other primitive accumulation like imperialist countries. We can only make full use of the existing weak industrial base, work diligently with our hands, and accumulate bit by bit. Therefore, the existing state property, be it an iron hammer or a screw, is extremely precious to us. If we cannot seriously take responsibility for protecting the property of our people's motherland, our economic construction will encounter great difficulties. Therefore, every patriotic Chinese, especially communists and the working class, should cherish all state property as they cherish their own lives.
    Examining the destruction events in industrial and mining enterprises in various places, there are mainly two reasons: one is the sabotage by Kuomintang bandits and special agent bandits. The Kuomintang reactionaries, the running dogs of imperialism, have never wanted a motherland. Now that their rule has perished and the country belongs to the people, they are even more desperately engaged in sabotage and robbery. They know that the Chinese people are diligently engaged in restoring and developing production, healing the wounds of war, and building the national economy to improve the people's living standards, so they deliberately carry out sabotage, attempting to destroy the national economy, plunge the people's lives into despair, and thereby shake the rule of the people's democratic regime. When the Kuomintang bandits fled, they looted and destroyed many cities and villages; and after these cities and villages were liberated, they continued to carry out assassination activities through pre-placed special agent bandits. The arson and destruction of trams in the Beiping Tram Factory is one of the thousands of such evil assassination activities carried out by special agent bandits. The second is the irresponsible attitude of some of our economic management personnel towards state property. There is currently an extremely harmful idea among them, that is, they only know that corruption is shameful, but they mistakenly believe that the huge losses to the state and the people's property caused by their negligence and lack of inspection are accidental and don't care. Because of this, bureaucratic work styles, lax management organizations and systems, relaxed discipline, inadequate fire safety equipment, and a lack of precautions and inspections in normal times still exist within some state-owned enterprises. Once an accident occurs, they either satisfy themselves with self-criticism, or simply do not report to higher authorities. If we do not launch a resolute attack on this bureaucratic bad habit, it will be impossible to protect state property completely from destruction.
    Therefore, in order to stop sabotage, restore and develop production, and build the national economy, we must: (1) Conduct regular education among workers, staff, and economic management personnel on the importance and cherishment of state property, so that everyone recognizes that protecting state property is everyone's sacred duty. Launch an ideological struggle against waste and destruction of state property within factories and enterprises, and resolutely combat the erroneous attitude of indifference towards state property. Call for increased vigilance, prevent sabotage by special agent bandits, organize worker pickets, and protect factories, mines, forests, and warehouses. Formulate and implement reward and punishment methods, clarify rewards and punishments, reward those who protect state property, and punish those who damage state property. (2) Establish a strict inspection system, and regularly inspect and improve the management, organization, system, discipline, and fire safety equipment of industrial and mining enterprises. If a fire or other disaster occurs due to dereliction of duty or poor management, the perpetrators and responsible personnel should be sanctioned by state law. Like the handling of the fire in the laboratory of the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant by the North China People's Government and the Beiping Military Control Commission this time, it is absolutely necessary to strictly investigate responsibility, detain and interrogate the parties involved, and punish them according to the severity of the circumstances. Otherwise, we will not be able to enforce state discipline and educate our economic management personnel and the vast number of employees to ensure that state property is not damaged. (3) For those special agent bandits who sabotage state-owned industrial and mining enterprises and the people's property, they must be brought to justice, and the ringleaders should be severely suppressed if the facts are verified, so that these petty villains dare not continue to do evil.

### 保护人民祖国的财产（二）

　　保护人民祖国的财产（二）
    最近不少地方的国家工矿企业接连发生失火和被毁事件。以北平一地为例，不久以前电车厂曾被特务纵火焚毁电车五十余辆，五月二十五日又发生石景山钢铁厂化验室失火案，使国家财富遭受浩大损失。对于这样严重危害人民祖国的事件，决不应让它继续发生，而必须迅速地采取必要的步骤，予以根绝！
    谁都知道，由于帝国主义、封建主义、官僚资本主义和国民党反动派的长期的统治，中国的工业基础十分薄弱，经济处于落后状态。在人民民主革命即将取得全国范围的胜利的时候，放在中国人民面前的一个最艰巨而伟大的任务，就是恢复和发展生产，使中国由落后的农业国变成先进的工业国，走向独立、民主、富强的道路。在中国共产党的领导之下，经过全国人民的勤劳努力，加上其他有利因素，这一近百年来许多优秀人士所怀抱的理想，是有把握在相当时期内实现的。但要建设工业，就必需有大量的资金。我们不能象帝国主义国家那样从掠夺和剥削殖民地和其他原始积蓄的野蛮方法来取得它，只有充分地利用现有的薄弱的产业基础，用双手辛勤地劳作，一点一滴地积垒起来。因此，现有的国家财产，就是一柄铁锤，一个螺丝钉，对于我们都是十分宝贵的。如果我们不能严肃地负责保护自己人民祖国的财产，那么我们的经济建设事业将会受到绝大的困难。所以，对于所有一切国家财产，每个有爱国心的中国人，首先是共产党人和工人阶级，应该象爱护自己的生命那样地来爱护它。
    检查各地工矿企业的被毁事件，主要地不外两个原因：一是国民党匪帮和特务匪徒的破坏。帝国主义走狗国民党反动派是从来不要祖国的，现在由于他们的统治已经灭亡，国家成为人民的了，便更加穷凶极恶地进行破坏和抢劫。他们知道，中国人民正在兢兢业业地从事恢复和发展生产，医治战争的创伤，建设国家经济，以提高人民的生活水准，便处心积虑地进行破坏，企图毁灭国家经济，使人民生活陷于绝境，从而动摇人民民主政权的统治。国民党匪帮在溃逃的时候，大肆洗劫和破坏许多城市和乡村；而在这些城市和乡村被解放后，又以预置的特务匪徒继续执行暗害勾当。北平电车厂电车的被纵火焚毁，便是特务匪徒们所做的千百种这种罪恶的暗害勾当之一。二是我们某些经济管理人员的对于国家财产的不负责任的态度。他们中间目前存在着一种极端有害的思想，就是仅仅知道贪污可耻，而对于自己玩忽职守、失于检点所招致的国家和人民财产的巨大损失，则错误地认为偶然不慎，满不在乎。正因如此，所以在某些国家企业内部，依然存在着官僚主义的作风，管理组织和制度松弛，纪律弛废，防火安全设备不周，平时疏于防范检查，一旦发生事故，大则满足于检讨，小则根本不向上级报告。如果不向这种官僚主义恶习气作坚决的进攻，要想保护国家财产完全免于破坏是不可能的。
    因此，我们为了制止破坏，以便恢复和发展生产，建设国家经济，便必须：（一）在工人、职员和经济管理人员中，经常地进行关于重视和爱护国家财产的教育，使大家认识保护国家财产是每个人的神圣职责。在工厂企业内部开展反对浪费和破坏国家财产的思想斗争，坚决地打击那种对于国家财产的漠不关心的错误态度。号召提高警惕，防止特务匪徒的破坏，组织工人纠察队，保卫工厂、矿山、森林、仓库。制订和实施奖惩办法，严明赏罚，保护国家财产者奖，损害国家财产者罚。（二）建立严格的检查制度，经常地检查和改进工矿企业的管理、组织、制度、纪律、消防安全设备。如因怠于职守或管理不善，以致发生失火或其他灾害，其肇事者和主管人员应该受到国家法律的制裁。象这次华北人民政府和北平军管会在处理石景山钢铁厂化验室失火案中那样，严格追究责任，扣押追讯当事人，按情节轻重分别处治，是完全必要的。否则，便不能严肃国家纪律，并教育我们的经济管理工作人员和广大职工，保障国家财产不受损害。（三）对于那些破坏国家工矿企业和人民财产的特务匪徒，务必缉获归案，对于首恶分子查有实据，便应施行严厉的镇压，使这辈宵小丑类不敢继续为非作恶。
