　　Ping Held a Factory Literary and Art Symposium
    Comrade Peng Zhen Called on Literary and Art Workers to Strengthen Theoretical Study and Integrate with Workers
    [Ping City News] The Preparatory Committee of the North Ping Municipal Federation of Trade Unions and the North Ping Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China jointly convened a factory literary and art symposium yesterday (13th). Participants included representatives from the Youth, Anti-Japanese, and Combat Drama Societies, the North China, North China University, and People's Art Troupe, the Northwest Delegation attending the National Literary Congress, the Third Field Army Delegation, the Propaganda Department of the North China Bureau of the CPC Central Committee, the Propaganda Department of the North Ping Municipal Committee of the CPC, and various newspapers in Ping, totaling 118 people. The meeting was chaired by a presidium composed of Comrade Li Leguang, Deputy Minister of the Propaganda Department of the Municipal Party Committee, Comrade Zeng Ping, Minister of the Propaganda Department of the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions, and Comrade Li Bozhao of the Municipal Cultural Committee. Comrade Zeng Ping, Minister of the Propaganda Department of the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions, gave a brief introduction to the factories in Ping, and everyone discussed the creative and organizational issues of literary and art workers working in factories. At 1:00 PM, Comrade Peng Zhen attended the meeting and spoke, pointing out that the main target of education for literary and art workers in North Ping is the workers. Literary and art comrades must: First, strengthen the study of Marxist-Leninist theory. Second, integrate with the workers and become "one of their own." Our responsibility is to concentrate the positive aspects of the workers and overcome the backward aspects of the workers, and use new and progressive things to transform the old things. The influence of the old things on the workers today is still considerable. We cannot surrender, nor can we overthrow everything. We are developing the new—representing the people—to transform the old. Some workers have been influenced by non-proletarian consciousness. If we do not strengthen the study of Marxist-Leninist theory and do not have a proletarian viewpoint, we will not be able to criticize it; at the same time, if we do not integrate with the workers, we cannot talk about absorbing the materials of the workers, nor can we talk about educating the workers. This means that we must first transform ourselves. In order to make everyone understand and cooperate with the current central work, Comrade Peng Zhen briefly introduced the central work of North Ping in June to everyone. The meeting was very enthusiastic. Finally, Comrade Li Bozhao of the Municipal Cultural Committee summarized two points based on everyone's opinions: First, on the issue of creation: What should we write about? Everyone agreed to work hard to write about the workers, because they are the driving force for the development of the entire production and social development. Writing about workers must grasp two struggles: struggle against the hidden remnants of the enemy, and struggle against backward consciousness and backward phenomena that hinder production—that is,展开展开 criticism. On the issue of large and small forms: Workers require us to write short, concise, and small things (works with content suitable for large forms are equally welcome). Second, on the issue of organization: In order to cooperate better and in a more planned way, in the future, all units going to factories must go through the unified organization of the Municipal Cultural Committee and the Federation of Trade Unions, so that the leadership can more easily help everyone carry out their work. The issue of cadre study will also be uniformly resolved by the Municipal Cultural Committee in the future, and factory literary and art workers will be regularly convened to convey the Municipal Party Committee's decisions on various policies.

　　平召开工厂文艺座谈会
    彭真同志号召文艺工作者加强理论学习与工人结合
    【平市讯】北平市总工会筹委会同中共北平市文委昨（十三日）联合召集工厂文艺工作座谈会，与会者有青年、抗敌、战斗剧社，华北、华大、人民文工团、出席全国文代的西北代表团、第三野战军代表团、中共中央华北局宣传部、中共北平市委宣传部及在平各报社等代表共一百一十八人。会议由市委宣传部副部长李乐光同志、市总工会宣传部长曾平同志、市文委李伯钊同志组织主席团主持。市总工会宣传部长曾平同志把平市各工厂作了简明的介绍，大家就文艺工作者下厂工作的创作问题、组织问题等展开讨论。下午一时彭真同志到会讲话，他指出：北平文艺工作者教育的主要对象是工人。文艺工作同志必须：第一、加强马列主义理论的学习。第二、和工人打成一片，成为工人“自己的人”。我们的责任是把工人中积极的东西集中起来，克服工人中落后的东西，拿新的进步的东西改造旧的东西，旧的东西今天在工人中的影响比重还相当大，我们既不能投降，又不能一切打倒。我们就是发展新的—代表人民的，来改造旧的。工人中有的人习染了非无产阶级的意识，我们不加强马列主义理论的学习，没有无产阶级的观点，就无法批判；同时如果不和工人打成一片，就谈不到吸收工人的材料，也谈不到教育工人。这就是说要首先改造自己。为了使大家明了和配合目前的中心工作，彭真同志又简略地把北平市六月份几项中心工作向大家作了介绍。会议讨论的很热烈，最后市文委李伯钊同志根据大家意见综合了两点：一、创作问题上：写什么呢？大家都同意努力写工人，因为他是带动整个生产发展和社会发展的。写工人必须掌握两种斗争：与敌人隐蔽的残余势力作斗争，和阻碍生产的落后意识、落后现象作斗争——即展开批评。大形式和小形式的问题：工人要求我们写短小精干小型东西（有内容的适合大形式的作品，一样欢迎）。二、组织问题：为了配合得更好，更有计划，今后各单位下工厂，须经过市文委和总工会统一组织，这样领导上才更容易帮助大家进行工作。干部学习问题，将来也由市文委统一解决，定期召集工厂文艺工作者，传达市委关于各种政策的决定。
