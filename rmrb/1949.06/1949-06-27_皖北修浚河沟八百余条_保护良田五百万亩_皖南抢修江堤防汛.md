　　Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 26th: In northern Anhui, large-scale water conservancy projects in the Su County and Fuyang regions, encompassing more than ten counties including Lingbi, Mengcheng, Hao County, Taihe, and Fuyang, have been completed successively with the full efforts of over one million people. Nearly 5.2 million mu of flood-prone land can now be transformed into fertile farmland. These ten-plus counties are located in the Huai River plain, traversed by rivers such as the Huai River, Ying River, Fei River, and Wo River. Due to years of neglect under the Kuomintang rule, the river channels were silted up, causing floods nine years out of ten. Last autumn, in Su County region alone, statistics from twenty-six districts showed that 400,000 people suffered from floods. This spring, after the victory of the Huaihai Campaign and the liberation of the entire area, the People's Government allocated over 8 million jin of grain to provide work relief and lead the people in water conservancy construction. Each of the affected counties successively established water conservancy committees and started construction separately in early April. Many county and district cadres participated in carrying mud and soil. Currently, the water conservancy projects in the region have been completed successively. A total of 107 large and small rivers have been repaired, 755 ditches and canals have been dredged, 17 areas of lake water have been drained, and 93 bridges, sluices, and culverts have been built.
    【Also from the same source】The people along the Yangtze River in southern Anhui are also actively rushing to repair river embankments to prevent floods. The Yangtze River embankments, stretching 190+ kilometers from Dongliu County to Dangtu County, have 37 dangerous sections. Last year, ten major dikes collapsed. This spring, the Kuomintang army built bunkers and dug trenches on the riverbank, severely damaging the river embankments. After the liberation of the area, the People's Government immediately mobilized the people of six counties—Dangtu, Wuhu, Fanchang, Tongling, Guichi, and Dongliu—to form river defense committees and rush to repair the embankments. The county heads of Tongling, Guichi, and Dongliu personally went to the dikes to provide guidance. Since construction began in May, most of the major dangerous dikes have been repaired, and work is still underway. During the repairs, several dikes collapsed due to rising water levels, but fortunately, tens of thousands of workers from various counties braved the rain to repair and block the breaches, preventing widespread flooding. Currently, while continuing to repair the unfinished dikes, each county is also preparing a large quantity of bamboo and timber piles to prevent further flooding from the river.

　　皖北修浚河沟八百余条
  　保护良田五百万亩
  　皖南抢修江堤防汛
    【新华社上海二十六日电】安徽北部宿县、阜阳两分区所辖灵璧、蒙城、毫县、太和、阜阳等十余县的大规模水利工程，在百余万民众全力兴修下，已先后完成，将近五百二十万亩的水灾田均可变为良田。该十余县地处淮河平原，淮河、颖河、肥河、涡河等河流横贯境内，因国民党统治时期连年失修，致河道淤塞，十年九潦。去秋仅宿县分区二十六个区统计即有四十万人遭受水灾。今春淮海战役胜利结束，全境获解放后，人民政府即拨粮八百余万斤，以工代赈，领导人民兴修水利。各受灾县份先后成立水利委员会，并于四月初分别动工。很多县、区干部都参加挑泥抬土。现该区水利工程已先后竣工。共修治大小河流一百零七条，疏浚沟渠七百五十五条，排除湖地积水十七处、修筑桥梁、水闸、涵洞共九十三座。
    【又电】安徽南部沿江人民也在积极抢修江堤，以防江汛。上自东流县下至当涂县的长江江堤一百九十余公里，有险工三十七处。去年曾有主要干堤十处溃决，今春又遭国民党军在江岸修筑碉堡，挖掘壕沟，江堤圩埂破坏极重。该地解放以后，人民政府即发动当涂、芜湖、繁昌、铜陵、贵池、东流六县人民，分别组织江防委员会，急起抢修。铜陵、贵池、东流三县县长，都亲自上堤指导。自五月间兴工以来，主要险工堤岸已大部修复，现仍在继续赶修。在抢修中，有多处圩堤曾因水涨溃决，幸经各县数万民工冒雨修补堵塞，未泛滥成灾。现各县一面继续修补未竣圩堤，一面筹备大批竹木桩料，以防止江水再汛。
