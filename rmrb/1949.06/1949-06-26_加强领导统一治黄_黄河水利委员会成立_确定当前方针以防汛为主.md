Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, 25th: Representatives from the North China, Henan, and Shandong Liberated Areas convened in Jinan from the 16th to the 20th to establish the Yellow River Water Conservancy Commission, unifying the work of managing the Yellow River. At the meeting, Wang Huayun, Zhang Fang, Yuan Long, Zhao Mingfu, Peng Xiaoqian, Zhang Huiseng, Jiang Yankun, Qian Zhengying, and Zhou Baoqi were elected as members of the commission. The commission's headquarters are temporarily located in Kaifeng. The meeting heard reports on the Yellow River management work of the three liberated areas over the past three years. Based on the current difficult conditions, it determined the current policy of prioritizing flood control, followed by river management, and formulated a six-month work plan. Since March 1946, when the Kuomintang reactionary government violated the agreement by breaching the dike at Huayuankou and releasing water, after the Yellow River returned to its old course, the people of the liberated areas had to carry out the Yellow River management projects section by section due to the occupation and division of the river areas by bandit troops. After the liberation of Zhengzhou, Kaifeng, Jinan and other places last year, the three liberated areas of North China, Henan and Shandong were completely connected. In order to overcome the many difficulties in the sectional management and strengthen the project leadership, the people's governments of the three regions began to prepare for the establishment of this unified Yellow River management agency in December last year. For more than three years, the people's governments of the three liberated areas have led the people in carrying out arduous and enormous Yellow River management projects. Regardless of the Kuomintang bandit troops' sabotage of dikes, harassment, looting, and aircraft bombing and strafing, they have completed 1,800 li of levee restoration and repaired countless dangerous works with 25 million man-days, preventing major losses to the lives and property of millions of people along the river.

　　加强领导统一治黄
  　黄河水利委员会成立
  　确定当前方针以防汛为主
    【新华社济南二十五日电】华北、河南、山东三解放区人民政府派出代表，于十六日至二十日在济南集会成立了黄河水利委员会，统一治理黄河工作。会上推定王化云、张方、袁隆、赵明甫、彭笑千、张慧僧、江衍坤、钱正英、周保淇等九人为该会委员。会址暂设开封。会议听取了三个解放区三年来治理黄河的工作汇报，根据目前困难条件，确定了以防汛为主，治本次之的当前治理黄河的方针，并制订了半年工作计划。自一九四六年三月国民党反动政府违约在花园口堵口放水，黄河归故以后，由于沿河地区为匪军侵踞分割，解放区人民治理黄河的工程不得不分区分段进行。至去年郑州、开封、济南等地解放，华北、河南、山东三解放区完全连成一片后，三个地区的人民政府，为克服分区进行中的许多困难，加强工程领导，仍从去年十二月开始筹备成立此统一的治黄机构。三年多以来，三解放区人民政府曾领导人民进行了艰苦巨大的治黄工程，不顾国民党匪军的挖堤破坏，窜扰抢掠以及飞机轰炸扫射，先后以二千五百万个人工，完成了一千八百里长的复堤工程和抢修无数处的险工，使沿河千百万人民的生命财产未受大的损失。
