　　III. Materials to be Selected for Studying Chinese History (Continued from XIII)
    Before China had reliable written historical materials—that is, before the period of credible history, there was a long period of mythological legends. Therefore, historical materials for studying Chinese history can be divided into two parts.
    Part 1: Materials of Mythological Legends from the Pre-historic Period:
    Zhang Xuecheng said, "The Six Classics are all history." Besides the Six Classics, we now have many ancient books, but many of these books are very unreliable, and their records of the origin of Chinese history are very inconsistent. The Book of Documents begins with the era of Emperors Yao and Shun, the Bamboo Annals starts with the Xia Dynasty, and the Records of the Grand Historian begins with the Yellow Emperor. There are also many claims about Pangu creating the heavens and the earth and the Three Sovereigns and Five Emperors, but these are unreliable. According to the results of recent archaeological knowledge, the ancient artifacts unearthed in China only date back to the Shang Dynasty. The Shang Dynasty was still an era of coexistence of stone and metal, with writing just emerging, production tools and agriculture were still in their infancy, and there is no evidence of iron tools. Therefore, we can only consider the records in ancient books before the Shang Dynasty as mythological legends, and only from the Shang Dynasty onwards can we say that China has true history.
    What certainty do we have to determine which legends are true and which are false? We can only, on one hand, make the most of the limited physical objects such as oracle bone inscriptions, bronze vessels, and newly unearthed Neolithic and copper-stone artifacts; on the other hand, we must use Marx's historical materialistic dialectics as our only weapon to dissect prehistoric human society. Although Marx did not write a specific book on ancient societies, Engels, based on Morgan's decades of field research, wrote the great work "The Origin of the Family, Private Property and the State." Engels said in the preface to this book: "This book contains some of the significance of completing a will. Apart from Karl Marx, no one else could have carried forward the results of Morgan's research (LEwiz. H. Morgan) and connected them with his own materialist conception of history. Marx wanted to use this to explain the full meaning of this concept. Morgan independently discovered in America, the materialist conception of history that Marx had pioneered forty years earlier. In the comparison between semi-civilized and civilized generations, he reached roughly the same conclusions as Marx." Therefore, we can regard the conclusions reached by Morgan's research as consistent with Marx's materialist conception of history.
    The law of historical development of human society is unitary, and it has its generality and commonality. Therefore, the development of Chinese social history certainly cannot have a different path outside this common law.
    We will use these two aspects to judge the authenticity of ancient books' records of ancient society.
    According to Morgan's research on ancient societies, the stages of social evolution in the prehistoric period can be arranged as follows:

    Note: Engels summarized Morgan's classification in "The Origin of the Family, Private Property and the State" as follows:
    Savagery - The era mainly obtaining readily available natural products, and human technical products are probably tools to help with this acquisition.
    Barbarism - The era of acquiring knowledge of animal husbandry and cultivation, and learning new methods to increase the productivity of natural products through human activities.
    Civilization - The era of learning more extensive use of natural products, engaging in manufacturing and art.
    Part 2: Relatively Reliable Historical Records Since the Beginning of Written History.
    Since the Shang Dynasty, especially after the Qin and Han Dynasties, there has been a profusion of Chinese historical books. However, there are many records of the rise and fall of dynasties and the personal activities of emperors and generals, but very few records of social life, especially the most important facts about social economic production, etc. This requires us to carefully search in all aspects. The land and peasant problem is the most fundamental issue in Chinese history. If we pay attention everywhere, there are many materials available for our research. For example, in terms of production tools:
    The Commentary on the Appended Judgments of the Book of Changes says:
    "Cutting wood to make a si (hoe), bending wood to make a lei (spade)." The Book of Songs says:
    "Order my people, prepare your qian (hoe-like), 奄 (spade-like), guan (sickle), and scythe."
    The Book of Mencius says:
    "Carrying a si and lei from Song to Teng." "Cooking with pots and steamers, tilling with iron." "Axes and hatchets enter the mountains and forests at the right time." "Deep plowing and frequent weeding." And so on.
    The Discourses of the States says:
    "Use good gold (copper) to cast swords and halberds, and test them on dogs and horses; use bad gold (iron) to cast chu (plow), yi (hoe-like tool for weeding), jin (similar to a hoe but smaller), jue (a type of hoe for digging up soil), and test them on soil." (Discourses of Qi) and so on.
    In terms of production relations:
    Dong Zhongshu of the early Han Dynasty said:
    "The Qin... used the laws of Shang Yang, changed the system of emperors and kings, abolished the well-field system, and the people could buy and sell land, so that the rich owned fields stretching across the land, while the poor had no place to stand... Towns had the dignity of a lord, and villages had the wealth of a duke, how could the common people not be poor?... Some till the fields of wealthy households, paying taxes of 50% (Shi Gu said, this means that poor people who have no land themselves cultivate the land of wealthy households, and give 50% of what they produce to the landlord), so poor people often wear the clothes of cattle and horses, and eat the food of dogs and pigs... Although the ancient well-field system is difficult to implement completely, it should be somewhat close to the ancient system, and limit the land ownership of the people (Shi Gu said, this means limiting the land occupied), in order to relieve the insufficiency and block the path of annexation." ("Book of Han," Volume 24, Part 1, "Treatise on Food and Money," Part 4, Part 1)
    These can enable us to know the outline of the production tools and production relations at that time.
    The basic method of production in Chinese feudal society was the integration of small-scale agriculture and family handicraft industry. This made the self-sufficient economy deeply rooted and consolidated the clan system that remained from the tribal society. From this socio-economic foundation, a social thought and theory based on filial piety as the core of ethical morality was formed, and this thought and theory in turn consolidated the family system. This integration of small-scale agriculture and family handicraft industry was exactly what the so-called ancient sages sought. As Mencius describes the best rural life:
    "In a five-mu homestead, plant mulberry trees, and those who are fifty can wear silk; raise chickens, pigs, dogs, and swine, without missing their time, and those who are seventy can eat meat; in a hundred-mu field, do not seize their time, and a family of eight can have no hunger; carefully attend to the education of schools, and repeatedly emphasize the meaning of filial piety and brotherly respect, and those with gray hair will not carry loads on the road; the elderly wear silk and eat meat, and the common people are not hungry or cold, and yet there has never been one who does not become king."

　　三、研究中国历史应选择的材料（续十三）
    中国在有确实的文字史料以前——也就是在有信史以前，还有一个很长的神话式传说时期，因此研究中国历史的史料可以分为两部分。
    第一部分史前时期神话传说式记载的材料：
    章学诚说：“六经皆史”。除了六经以外，现在我们还有许多古书，但是这些书有很多极不可靠，而他们记载中国历史的起源，又很不一致，尚书则开始于唐虞，竹书纪年起于夏，史记则开始于黄帝。还有许多盘古开天辟地以及三皇五帝等等说法，但是这些都是靠不住的，因为根据最近考古学的知识所得的结果，中国出土的古物只出到商代，而商代还是金石并用的时代，文字方在产生的过程，生产工具和农业还属幼稚，还没有发现铁器的证明。因此，我们从商代起才算中国有真正的历史，商代以前底古书记载只能看作神话传说式的记载。
    我们有什么把握来断定某些传说是真的，某些传说是假的呢？我们只有一面尽量利用龟甲文，彝器及现在新出土的新石器和金（青铜）石并用等等有限的实物；一面还要用马克思的史的唯物辩证法来作我们解剖史前时期人类社会的唯一武器。马克思虽然没有论古代社会的专书，恩格斯却根据摩尔根数十年实地研究的结果，写成“家族私有财产及国家之起源”一部伟大的著作。恩格斯在本书的原序上说：“本书含有几分完成遗志的意义。除卡尔·马克思外，没有一人能够发扬光大摩尔根（ＬＥｗｉｚ．Ｈ．Ｍｏｒｇａｎ）所研究的结果而与自己的唯物史观连系起来。马克思很想借此阐明这观念的全部意义。因摩尔根在美洲又单独发现马克思已于四十年前所首创的唯物史观。他于半开化和文明两代的比较中，大体上得到和马克思相同的结论。”因此，我们可以把摩尔根研究所得的结论，看作是合乎马克思的唯物史观的。
    人类社会历史发展的法则是一元的，都有他的一般性，共同性。因此中国社会历史的发展，当然也不能在这个共同法则之外另有一条道路。
    我们就以这两方面来判断古书记载古代社会的真伪。
    根据摩尔根古代社会的研究，史前时期社会进化的阶段可以排列如下表：
    （附图片）
    附注：恩格斯在“家族私有财产及国家之起源”中将摩尔根的分类节约如下：
    蒙昧——以获得现成的自然生产物为主的时代，人类之技术生产物大概是帮助这种获得的工具。
    野蛮——获得畜牧及耕作的知识，以及学习由人类的活动以增加天产物生产力的新方法的时代。
    文明——习得天产物的更广大的利用，从事制造及艺术之时代。
    第二部分自有成文史以来比较可靠的历史记载的材料。
    自商代以来，特别是秦汉以后，中国的史书真是汗牛充栋。但是记载朝代兴亡和帝王将相个人活动的多，而关于社会生活，尤其是关于社会经济生产等等最重要的事实，反特别的少，这就需要我们能细心地在各方面去搜寻。土地农民问题是中国历史中最基本的问题。如果我们随处注意，也有不少的材料足供我们研究。如生产工具方面：
    易经系辞下传中有：
    “斫木为耜（锄），揉木为耒（锹）。”诗经中有：
    “命我众人，＠（准备）乃钱（锄类）＠（锹类）奄观＠（镰）芟”
    孟子书中有：
    “负耜耒而自宋之滕”。“以釜甑爨，以铁耕乎。”“斧斤以时入山林”。“深耕易耨”。等等。
    国语中有：
    “美金（铜）以铸剑戟，试诸狗马；恶金（铁）以铸锄（犁）夷（锄类用以除草）斤（似锄而小者）掘（锄的一种掘起土的）试诸土壤。”（齐语）等等。
    生产关系方面：
    汉初董仲舒说：
    “秦………用商鞅之法，改帝王之制，除井田，民得卖买，富者田连阡陌，贫者亡立锥之地，………邑有人君之尊，里有公侯之富，小民安得不困，……或耕豪民之田，见税什五，（师古曰，言下户贫人自无田而耕垦豪富家田，十分之中以五输本田主也。）故贫民常衣牛马之衣，而食犬彘之食……古井田法虽难卒行，宜少近古，限民名田，（师古曰，名田占田也。）以澹不足，塞兼并之路。”（“汉书”，卷二十四上，“食货志”第四上）
    这些都能使我们知道当时生产工具和生产货关系的概要。
    中国封建社会基本的生产方法是小农业与家庭工业合成一体。这就使自给自足的经济根深蒂固而巩固了氏族社会残余的家族制度。由这个社会经济基础，形成了以孝为本的伦常道德的社会思想和理论，又由这个思想和理论的反响来巩固家庭制度。这种小农业与家庭工业合为一体正是中国所谓古圣贤所企求的。如孟子描写最好的农村生活说：
    “五亩之宅，树之以桑，五十者可以衣帛矣，鸡豚狗彘之畜，无失其时，七十者可以食肉矣，百亩之田，勿夺其时，八口之家，可以无饥矣，谨庠序之教，申之以孝悌之义，颁白者不负载于道路矣，老者衣帛食肉，黎民不饥不寒，然而不王者未之有也。”
