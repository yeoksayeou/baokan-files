    The Ping Municipal Government Decides to Impose the Severest Punishment
    [This Newspaper's Report] Song Bingsheng, a notorious bandit who murdered our revolutionary cadres, has been captured. Before the liberation of Beiping, this bandit repeatedly robbed people's property and was long hated by the people. After liberation, he continued to collude with bandits Lian Zhenhe, Bai Xingwu, Zhang Fu, and 10 others, to rob people's grain, vehicles, gold rings, cloth, etc., in Xisi, Taiping Street, Fengtai and other places. They often tortured the owners of the robbed items with cruel methods. On the evening of April 15, this bandit, along with bandits Lian Zhenhe, Ai Chunmao, and two others, robbed house number 14 on Taiping Street in the Inner Sixth District. Comrade Zhu Kai, a cadre from the Outer First District Government, was sending his nephew to this house, and discovered this gang of bandits. Comrade Zhu bravely used his pistol to shoot at the bandit. Bandit Song Bingsheng returned fire with his gun, and Comrade Zhu was killed on the spot. The bandits fled in fear of punishment. The Public Security Bureau's Suburban Sixth Precinct, based on clues, made great efforts to search and finally captured the bandit Song Bingsheng. Lian Zhenhe, Bai Xingwu, and 10 other habitual bandits who colluded with him in the robbery were also arrested one after another. Two pistols and 52 pieces of stolen goods were seized. The stolen goods have been claimed by their owners. Song Bingsheng's crimes are heinous. In order to protect the safety of the lives and property of the people of Ping City, the People's Government has decided to impose the severest punishment on him.
