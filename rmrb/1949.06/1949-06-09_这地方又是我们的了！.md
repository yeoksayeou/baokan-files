　　This place is ours again!
    Fang De
    When the army entered the old liberated areas of the Jiangxi Northeast Soviet, the villagers flocked to both sides of the road to see their relatives, hoping to find their sons and brothers among the thousands of warriors. Young women were busy carrying fragrant tea from far away to the roadside, posting slogans everywhere such as "Comrades, prepare bowls, there is tea in front." We no longer heard the annoying terms like "Lord," or "Official." People called us "Comrades" with particular warmth—this was what the villagers in this area had been used to calling us twenty years ago. When the soldiers stopped to drink water on the way, beads of sweat kept dripping down. The old ladies would come over with fans to fan them, just like mothers caring for their children. Some were pouring tea back and forth, afraid that the tea would be too hot for the soldiers to drink. As soon as the troops settled down, the villagers would gather around and ask, "Are you the Red Army?" Strong men around the age of thirty always liked to say, "I joined the Children's Corps in 1929." I passed by Lijia Bridge and Xujia Great House in Yiyang, which used to be the location of the Red Army Hospital. The villagers still circulated stories of the Red Army's heroic battles, and they felt particularly honored when talking about their own brothers fighting. A tutor pointed to his house and said, "Old Red Army soldiers lived here. It was rebuilt after being burned down by the Kuomintang! It's been fifteen years, and it still doesn't look like a house. Not long after you left here to go north to resist the Japanese, the Kuomintang killed my brother too." Over the long period of fifteen years, these sad stories circulated among the people, cultivating their will to seek revenge.
    When the Kuomintang bandit army was in full retreat, the villagers here rose up on their own to capture scattered bandits, arming themselves with the captured weapons to avenge their enemies. A farmer ambushed at a strategic crossroads in the mountains, watching five stragglers approaching with a submachine gun and two rifles. He put his hand in his pocket, stepped forward, and suddenly jumped out, saying, "I am a reconnaissance man from the regiment headquarters, surrender your guns! Come with me!" The enemies obediently handed over their guns. I met two young farmers who had just been released from Hengfeng Prison two or three days ago. They said, "We've been waiting with our eyes almost worn out, but finally we've seen you! Some of those who were imprisoned with us had been there for fifteen years. Last year, when the Yiyang People's Guerrilla Unit was still more than a hundred li away from here, we were arrested for participating in secret underground armed forces. Now that you are here, what are we waiting for!" Three days later, the people of Lijia Bridge had seized more than 30 guns from the Kuomintang bandit army. They told me with confidence, "Don't worry, just fight south! We will soon eliminate the scattered bandits. In less than two months, the people can all be organized. This place is ours again!"

　　这地方又是我们的了！
    方德
    当大军进入赣东北土地革命时代的老解放区时，老乡们都涌在大路两旁来看自己的亲人，想从这万千勇士中找寻他们的儿子、兄弟。年青的妇女们忙着从很远的地方挑着香茶来到大路口，到处张贴着“同志准备碗，前面有茶水”的标语。我们不再听到“老总”、“官长”之类的讨厌称呼。人们分外亲切地叫我们“同志”——这是这一带老乡们二十年前就惯用的。战士们在途中停下脚站着喝水的时候，汗珠子不停地下滴着，老太太便拿扇子凑过来给他们扇风，好象母亲关心着孩子们一样。有的在一边来回倒着茶，生怕茶太烫了战士们不好喝。只要队伍住下来，老乡们都围拢来问：“你是红军吗？”三十岁左右的壮年人总爱说：“我是一九二九年参加童子团的。”我路过弋阳境内的李家桥和徐家大屋，这里曾经是红军医院的所在地，老乡们还流传着红军英勇作战的故事，特别是在说到他们自己亲兄弟作战的时候，分外感到光荣。一位塾师指着自己的房子说：“我这里住过老红军，被国民党烧光以后才新修的呀！十五年了还没有修成一座房子的样子。你们离开这里北上抗日不久，国民党把我的弟弟也杀了”。十五年的长时期内，这些悲痛的故事在人民中间流传着，培养着他们的复仇的意志。
    国民党匪军大溃退的时候，这里的老乡们自己起来捉散匪，将缴获的武器武装自己，报仇杀敌。有一个农民伏在山地的要路口，眼看着五个散兵扛着一支冲锋枪和两支步枪走近来，他便把手插到衣袋里向前一挺，猛的跳出来说“我是团部的侦察员，缴枪！跟我走！”敌人就很恭顺地把枪交了。我遇见前两三天才从横峰监狱中被解放回家的两个青年农民，他们说：“眼睛都快望穿了，到底望到呀！和我们一起坐牢的，有坐了十五年的人。去年弋阳的人民游击队离这里还有百多里时，我们因为参加秘密地下武装被捕的。今天你们来了，我们不干还等什么！”三天以后，李家桥的人民便收缴到国民党匪军三十多支枪了。他们满有信心地向我说：“你们放心向南打！我们不久就会把散匪解决干净。不用两个月，老百姓全可以组织起来。这地方又是我们的了！”　　（新华社南昌八日电）
