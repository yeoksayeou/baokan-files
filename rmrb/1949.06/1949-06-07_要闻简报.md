　　Shanghai Battle Medical Personnel Give Blood
　　During the Shanghai liberation battle, the medical workers of the People's Liberation Army served the wounded with high revolutionary enthusiasm. To save the wounded who had lost too much blood, from the medical team leader to the cook, all enthusiastically requested to donate blood. A certain medical team donated 2,800+ CC of blood from nineteen people in five days from May 22nd to 27th. In order to save a soldier with a severe chest injury, more than forty people from a certain health department competed to donate blood. A certain medical team, after a long and continuous march without rest for four days and nights, immediately accepted the wounded and started working upon arrival. Three of the eight cooks were ill, but they made meals for more than six hundred wounded soldiers. The fifteen comrades in the laundry squad washed 560 sets of blood-stained clothes for the wounded in ten hours, and also squeezed out time to feed the wounded and deliver boiling water. Many comrades who had donated blood were unwilling to rest and continued to persevere in their work. Many seriously wounded soldiers were turned from danger to safety and restored to health due to their enthusiastic treatment and careful care. The wounded sincerely thanked the revolutionary love of the medical staff and expressed that they would quickly return to the front line to work hard to kill the enemy to repay them, and some even wrote their names in their manuals, never to forget them.
