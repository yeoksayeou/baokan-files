Xinhua News Agency, Peiping, June 28th: TASS, Moscow, June 26th: The newspaper *Pravda* published an article entitled "Truman's Brazen Boast," stating: The White House issued a statement by Truman on June 21 regarding the Paris Foreign Ministers' Conference. This statement is full of shameless boasting and tendentious distortions of the conference's achievements.

The main conclusion that Truman's statement constantly emphasizes is that the achievements of the Paris Foreign Ministers' Conference "prove" that the "line" followed by the United States in its foreign policy is "correct." However, this conclusion is as far from the truth as can be.

If the Truman administration's foreign policy were correct, then how would one explain the agreements that the American ruling circles consented to at the Paris Conference, agreements that until recently could not be achieved precisely because of the American foreign policy line so praised by the President? Mr. Truman is forced to resort to self-aggrandizement not because everything is going smoothly. The truth is that the Paris Conference reached agreements only because the representatives of the Western countries abandoned the line they had always followed. Therefore, the purpose of the American President's recent statement, full of self-praise, is to conceal his weak position and the failure of American foreign policy.

As the world knows, the foreign policy of the United States is diametrically opposed to the program of international cooperation adopted at the Potsdam Conference in 1945. The implementation of the policy of dividing Germany, turning its western part into a military-strategic bridgehead for the United States, establishing the aggressive North Atlantic Treaty Organization, and so on, are concrete manifestations of the departure from the Potsdam resolutions.

At the Paris Conference, Acheson, Bevin, and Schuman regarded forcing the Soviet Union to accept this anti-Potsdam line as their main task. That is why they constantly tried to extend the Bonn Constitution and the occupation statutes, which they used to consolidate Anglo-American rule in Germany, to the Soviet-occupied zone of Germany.

However, all the attempts of the Western countries in this direction failed. Moreover, the United States, Britain, and France were forced to abandon their traditional anti-Potsdam line and, with a heavy heart, acknowledge that the Potsdam principles must be adopted.

Now, let's look at the communiqué of the Foreign Ministers' Conference! The communiqué first points out that at the Fourth UN General Assembly in September, the governments of the Soviet Union, the United States, Britain, and France will agree on the date and other preparations for the next Foreign Ministers' Conference to discuss the German issue. In this way, the three Western countries acknowledged that their policy of boycotting the Foreign Ministers' Conference, which they had pursued for nearly two years based on the anti-Potsdam line, was unsound.

The communiqué secondly points out that the future activities of the Foreign Ministers' Conference should aim at reaching an agreement on restoring the economic and political unity of Germany. In this way, the three Western countries were forced to acknowledge (albeit in a veiled manner) that their policy of dividing Germany, which violated the basic principles and foundations of the Potsdam resolutions, had failed and had to be revised. Who doesn't know that it is precisely the Soviet Union that has adhered to the principles of the Potsdam resolutions, and has consistently opposed the policy of dividing Germany in the past and now, insisted on restoring the economic and political unity of Germany, insisted on establishing an all-German government, and restoring Germany's due rights as a free, equal, and peace-loving country?

The communiqué of the Foreign Ministers' Conference also stated: "In accordance with the willingness of the Foreign Ministers to continue their efforts to achieve the restoration of the economic and political unity of Germany, the occupying authorities should jointly consult on Berlin on a four-power basis." Mr. Truman can say whatever he pleases, saying that this point in the agreements reached in Paris proves the "correctness" of the "firm" policy pursued by the United States under the guidance of the Truman leadership group, using this to console himself or comfort his friends. However, such self-satisfaction can only provoke laughter, because it is such a ridiculous thing!... Instead of four countries consulting on the issue of German unification, it is three countries ordering, with the aim of dismembering Germany, which is the meaning of Truman's policy; and now, he and his followers have to retreat from this policy, but he is beating his drums loudly to cover it up.

At the Paris Foreign Ministers' Conference, the Western countries had to accept the Soviet Union's suggestions based on the Potsdam resolutions, and they "swallowed" a bitter pill. However, Truman described this as proof of the "correctness" of American foreign policy. Wouldn't it be more correct to say that this is clear proof of the failure of America's so-called "firm" policy?

Truman's statement boastfully publicized the "important achievements made by West Germany since 1945." However, the intention of this statement is to give the world public the impression that the United States continued the route of abandoning the Potsdam Declaration at the Paris Foreign Ministers' Conference; as if it was not forced to speak in a tone completely different from the slanderous principles of Potsdam that it used in the past two years at the Paris Foreign Ministers' Conference. Did the U.S. State Department not suddenly remember the Potsdam Declaration at the Paris Foreign Ministers' Conference and think it necessary to "strive" to restore Germany's political and economic unity, as stated in the communiqué adopted by the four foreign ministers (including the U.S. foreign minister)? Was Truman himself not also forced to talk about the need to alleviate the "abnormal situation" of Germany, which is still fragmented? People cannot but look back at the history of the so-called "two combined occupation zones" and "three combined occupation zones," the separate issuance of West German marks in the U.S., British, and French occupation zones, and the establishment of a West German "state" in Bonn, the history of the Bonn Constitution, the occupation statutes, the three-country control, etc. People once again clearly and firmly believe that the "fragmented Germany" is the result of the American and British divisive policies. Truman is now wasting his efforts trying to conceal the failure of this policy by broadcasting and boasting about the victory of his so-called "firm policy." Mr. Truman also suffered the same crushing defeat. He wanted to enter through one door, but inevitably stumbled into another. If the disguise of Truman's statement is stripped away, then this statement sounds completely different from the effect the declarant intended. It undoubtedly proves that the American ruling clique was forced to accept some important decisions at the Paris Foreign Ministers' Conference that were in line with the spirit of the Soviet proposals.

Indeed, despite all the efforts of the Soviet government, the Paris Conference did not resolve the main issues concerning Germany. Everyone knows that the Soviet proposals aimed at restoring the political and economic unity of Germany, establishing an all-German Council of Ministers to carry out government duties, restoring the activities of the Control Commission, adjusting currency issues, and immediately implementing necessary measures to prepare for a peace treaty with Germany. These suggestions were not accepted. But it is clear to anyone that only these suggestions can serve as a true foundation for future efforts by the Foreign Ministers' Conference to restore Germany's political and economic unity. Truman's statement distorted everything, and also distorted the question of what guaranteed the possibility of agreement on the Austrian issue at the Paris Foreign Ministers' Conference. Undoubtedly, the agreement on the Austrian issue established the necessary prerequisites for a truly final resolution of the Austrian issue. However, no matter what Truman says, this was possible entirely because the Soviet government's suggestions were adopted, and the United States, Britain, and France abandoned their policy - the policy of sabotaging the Soviet Union's legitimate demands from the beginning of the meeting and throughout the entire period, and obstructing the reaching of an agreement on the Austrian issue on the basis of the Soviet Union's proposals.

As is well known, the American ruling clique and their European partners, who had been particularly stubborn in refusing to recognize the Soviet Union's legitimate rights to the former German assets in eastern Austria, now had to change their approach.

According to the decision of the Foreign Ministers' Conference, Austria will pay the Soviet Union 150 million U.S. dollars over a period of six years. Most of the oil assets in eastern Austria and the property of the Danube Shipping Company will be transferred to the Soviet Union, as proposed by the Soviet Union as early as January 24, 1948. In addition to these, the assets of the Danube Shipping Company in Hungary, Romania, and Bulgaria will also be handled in this way. All former German assets that have become Soviet property may not be changed without the consent of the Soviet Union.

The Paris Foreign Ministers' Conference also adopted a decision on the dispute between Yugoslavia and Austria. These decisions stipulate that Austria guarantees the protection of the rights of the Slovene and Carinthian minorities in Austria. At the same time, Yugoslavia's economic interests were also protected, because the Austrian property, interests, and rights in Yugoslavia's territory were handed over to Yugoslavia.

As for the Yugoslav government's territorial claims on Austria, Yugoslavia had been dealing with the United States and Britain behind the Soviet Union's back long before the Paris Foreign Ministers' Conference, but failed. As everyone knows, secret negotiations on this matter were held in the summer of 1947 by representatives of the Yugoslav government and the British representative, Norback, in Yugoslavia, and by the Yugoslav ambassador, Leontic, and the British Minister, McNair, in London. It is quite obvious that the Soviet government cannot bear any responsibility for the consequences of such behind-the-scenes negotiations.

That is the way things are. It must be admitted that in Truman's statement, the results of the Paris Foreign Ministers' Conference are reflected as in a funhouse mirror. One might ask - what is the purpose of this? The answer to this question can be found in the statement of the National Council of American-Soviet Friendship, an association that unites progressive and democratic people in American society.

The statement issued by the National Council of the Association said: "The American delegation has never attended a Foreign Ministers' Conference so reluctantly, for fear that their own policies, such as ratifying the North Atlantic Treaty, reorganizing Europe and America's armaments, and incorporating West Germany into their war plans, would be shattered. But the reality in Paris was stronger than the preconceived schemes. The peace-loving people of the world have won a victory in Paris."

The Paris Foreign Ministers' Conference was a policy failure for the instigators, organizers, and strategists of the "Cold War." Some people want to prevent the world public and their own people from knowing about this failure. They boast and distort the facts in order to create a good impression of themselves. The Paris Foreign Ministers' Conference was also a victory for peace-loving people.

The National Council of American-Soviet Friendship is right that the significance of this Foreign Ministers' Conference, which recently ended in Paris, is a victory for peace-loving people. This conference disrupted the plans of the instigators of aggression and exposed the reactionary ravings of the enemies of democracy and socialism against the Soviet Union, the unwavering fighter for peace and international cooperation.

The statement of the committee also said: "The strategists of the 'Cold War' have been deprived of their pretext for carrying out the 'Cold War,' and have been deprived of the pretext of saying that negotiations with the Soviet Union are impossible."

This is indeed a great victory for those who support peace and international cooperation. It goes without saying that no amount of boasting can conceal this failure of the "Cold War" strategists.

### 真理报论“杜鲁门大言不惭”  外长会议的成果，是爱好和平人民的胜利，任何吹牛都掩饰不了“冷战”战略家的失败！

　　真理报论“杜鲁门大言不惭”
    外长会议的成果，是爱好和平人民的胜利，任何吹牛都掩饰不了“冷战”战略家的失败！
    【新华社北平二十八日电】塔斯社莫斯科二十六日讯：真理报以“杜鲁门大言不惭”为题著论称：白宫发表了杜鲁门六月二十一日关于巴黎外长会议的声明，这一声明充满厚颜无耻的吹牛和对于外长会议成就的别有用心的曲解。
    杜鲁门声明中始终强调的主要结论是：巴黎外长会议的成就，“证明”美国在外交政策上所遵循的“路线正确”。然而，这个结论离事实之远，犹如天渊之别。
    如果杜鲁门政府的外交政策正确，那么，又怎样解释美国统治集团在巴黎会议上同意了的若干协议，而这些协议直到最近却正是由于总统所如此赞扬的美国的外交路线而无法获致的呢？杜鲁门先生之不得不采取自诩的办法，并不是因为万事顺利。真实的情况是：巴黎会议之所以达成协议，只是因为西方国家的代表们放弃了他们一向遵循的路线的结果。所以，美国总统最近这次满篇自吹自擂的声明，其目的，在于掩饰他的地位的虚弱和美国外交政策的失败。
    世人皆知：美国的外交政策，是和一九四五年波茨坦会议所通过的国际合作纲领势不两立的。执行分裂德国的政策，将它的西部变成美国的军事战略桥头阵地，建立侵略性的北大西洋集团等等，这些就是背离波茨坦决议的具体表现。
    在巴黎会议上，艾奇逊、贝文和舒曼，把强使苏联接受这个反波茨坦的路线视为他们的主要工作。这就是为什么他们始终力图将他们用以巩固美英在德统治的波恩宪法和占领法规也扩大到德国苏占区的原因。
    但是，西方国家在这个方向上的一切企图都失败了。而且，美英法被迫离开了他们传统的反波茨坦路线，而以沉重的心情承认非采用波茨坦原则不可。
    现在，让我们看看外长会议的公报吧！公报首先指出，在九月召开的第四届联合国大会上，苏美英法四国政府将协议举行讨论德国问题的下次外长会议的日期及其他准备事宜。这样三个西方国家承认了，它们本着反波茨坦路线奉行几达两年之久的抵制外长会议的政策，是不健全的。
    公报其次指出，外长会议今后的活动应以取得恢复德国经济与政治统一的协议为目的。这样，三个西方国家被迫承认了（虽然是用一种遮遮掩掩的方式）：他们违反波茨坦决议之基本原则和基础的分裂德国的政策遭受失败，并不得不予修正。谁不知道，恰恰是苏联，它信守波茨坦决议的原则，过去和现在都始终不渝地反对分裂德国的政策，坚持恢复德国经济和政治的统一，坚持建立全德政府并恢复德国作为一个自由、平等、爱好和平的国家所应有的权利呢？
    外长会议的公报又称：“按照各外长准备继续努力以求达到恢复德国经济与政治的统一的意愿，各占领当局应于柏林在四国基础上共同会商。”杜鲁门先生尽可以随他自己的高兴，说巴黎所获协议中的这一点，证明美国在杜鲁门领导集团的指导下所奉行的“坚定”政策之“正确”，借此聊以自慰或者安慰他的朋友。但是，这样地自鸣得意只能引起人们的哄然大笑，因为这是多么的令人发噱的事啊！……对于德国统一的问题，不是由四国协商，而是由三国命令，以肢解德国为目的，这就是杜鲁门政策的意义；而今，他和他的徒众们不得不从这个政策上退却了，但是，他却大擂其鼓以作掩护。
    在巴黎外长会议上，西方国家不得不接受苏联基于波茨坦决议的建议，他们“吞下”了一丸苦药。可是，杜鲁门却把这件事说成是美国外交政策“正确”的证明。如果说这是美国的所谓“坚定”政策失败的明证，岂不是更为正确么？
    杜鲁门的声明，吹牛地宣传“西德自一九四五年以来所获得的重要成果”。但是，这种声明的用意，是在给全世界公众一个印象，好象美国在巴黎外长会议上是继续了背弃波茨坦宣言的路线；好象它在巴黎外长会议上，用与它在过去两年来所用的诽谤波茨坦的原则完全不同的口气的说话，不是被迫的样子。美国国务院不是在巴黎外长会议上突然记起了波茨坦宣言，而想到有必要“努力”恢复德国政治与经济的统一，象四外长（包括美国外长）通过的公报中所说的那样吗？杜鲁门自己不是也被迫谈到有必要缓和至今还是支离破碎的德国的“反常局面”吗？人们不能不回溯所谓“两联合占领区”和“三联合占领区”，美英法占领区单独发行西德马克和在波恩建立西德“国家”的历史，回溯波恩宪法、占领法规、三国管制等等的历史，人们再一次清楚的确信，“支离破碎的德国”，乃是美英分裂政策的结果。杜鲁门现在枉费心血地想通过广播和吹嘘什么他的所谓“坚定方针”的胜利来掩饰的，就是这个政策的失败。杜鲁门先生也遭到了同样的惨败。他想由一扇门进去，但却不可免地闯进了另一扇门。如果剥去杜鲁门声明的伪装花腔，那么，这个声明听起来就与声明人所打算的效果完全两样。它无疑证明美国统治集团在巴黎外长会议上被迫接受了若干合乎苏联建议之精神的重要决定。
    的确，尽管苏联政府尽了一切努力，巴黎会议却未解决关系德国的主要问题。大家知道，苏联的建议目的在恢复德国政治和经济的统一，建立全德国务会议执行政府职务，恢复管制委员会的活动，调整货币问题以及立即实行必要措施，准备对德和约。这些建议没有被接受。但是任何人都清楚，只有这些建议才能够作为外长会议今后恢复德国政治与经济统一之努力的真正基础。杜鲁门的声明歪曲了一切方面，也歪曲了在巴黎外长会议上什么东西保证了在奥地利问题上协议之可能性的问题。无疑，在奥国问题上的协议，建立了真正最后解决奥国问题的必要前提。但是，不管杜鲁门怎么说，这一点之所以可能，完全是由于苏联政府的建议的得到通过，而美、英、法则放弃了他们的政策——从会议一开始就执行并在其后整个时期中也一直保持的破坏苏联合法要求，阻挠在苏联所建议的基础上就奥国问题取得协议的政策。
    众所周知，美国统治集团和他们的欧洲伙计们，他们曾特别固执的不承认苏联对东奥前德国资产的合法权利，但现在他们不得不改变方针了。
    按照外长会议的决定，奥国要在六年时期内支付苏联一亿五千万美元。在东奥的石油资产的大部分和多瑙河航运公司的财产，要转让给苏联，象苏联早在一九四八年一月二十四日就提出了的建议所说的那样。除了这些，还有多瑙河航运公司在匈牙利、罗马尼亚和保加利亚的资产，也如此处理。所有已成为苏联财产的前德国资产，未经苏联同意不得改变。
    巴黎外长会议同样还通过了关于南斯拉夫和奥地利之间争执问题的决定。这些决定规定奥国保证保护奥境斯洛文及克洛特少数民族的权利。同时，南斯拉夫的经济利益也得到了保护，因为南国领土上的奥国财产、利益和权利交给了南斯拉夫。
    至于南国政府对奥国的领土要求，在巴黎外长会议前很久，南斯拉夫就背着苏联和美英打交道，但是失败了。大家知道，关于这一点的秘密谈判，一九四七年夏曾由南政府代表和英代表诺尔巴克举行于南斯拉夫，也曾由南大使莱昂蒂契和英大臣麦克纳尔举行于伦敦。十分显然，苏联政府对这种背地里谈判的后果，不能负任何责任。
    事实就是如此。应该承认，在杜鲁门的声明里，巴黎外长会议的结果照得象在哈哈镜里一样。不妨请问一下——搞这么一套是为了什么呢？关于这个问题的答案，可以在美国美苏友好协会全国委员会的声明中找到，该协会是团结了美国社会上进步民主的人士的。
    该协会全国委员会所发表的声明说：“美国代表团出席外长会议，从来没有这样勉强过，因为深恐他们自己的政策，诸如批准北大西洋公约，重整欧洲和美国的武装，以及把西德并入他们的战争计划之类，会被粉碎。可是，巴黎的现实比预定的计谋更强有力些。世界爱好和平的人民在巴黎赢得了胜利。”
    巴黎外长会议是“冷战”的鼓动者、组织人和战略家们底政策的失败。有些人想不让世界公众和他们本国人民知道这一失败，他们大吹其牛，并且曲解事实，以便建立对他们自己的良好印象。巴黎外长会议同时也是爱好和平人民的胜利。
    美苏友好协会全国委员会说得对，新近在巴黎结束的这次外长会议的意义，是爱好和平人民的胜利。这次会议扰乱了鼓动侵略者的计划，揭穿了民主和社会主义之敌人对苏联，对这和平与国际合作的坚定不移的战士的反动谵语。
    该委员会的声明并说；“‘冷战’的战略家们被剥夺了他们进行‘冷战’的口实，被剥夺了说与苏联谈判是不可能的的口实。”
    这的确是拥护和平与国际合作者的一大胜利。不言而喻，任何吹牛都掩饰不了“冷战”战略家们的这一失败。
