Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, May 31st:
　　The rapid liberation of Shanghai has caused new chaos among the Kuomintang bandit gang in Guangzhou. The puppet government has ordered the bandit troops to dig trenches and build bunkers in the suburbs of Guangzhou. The number of bandit gang officials fleeing by train, ship, and plane has increased even more than a few days ago. On the 28th, China Merchants Steam Navigation Company ships were docked in Huangpu Port waiting to carry puppet legislators, puppet supervisors, and personnel from the Kuomintang Central Party Headquarters to Taiwan. The bandit gangs also passed a bill on the 27th in the name of a small group of puppet legislators, attempting to use the notorious "integration of soldiers and farmers" method implemented by war criminal Yan Xishan to cruelly exploit the peasants and force them to become soldiers. The Kuomintang's "gold yuan notes" are worthless in Guangzhou, and the market generally refuses to use them. The lives of public employees and general wage earners are extremely miserable. More than a thousand employees of the puppet Legislative Yuan went on a four-day collective work slowdown starting on the 23rd to demand the issuance of emergency funds and salary adjustments. Professors at Zhongshan University have had to rely on selling their clothes to make a living due to their inability to survive; to express their protest against the bandit gang, the professors specially auctioned off their furniture and books in front of the puppet education department on the 23rd. In other news, the Kuomintang troops stationed in Fuzhou are deserting in large numbers because they are unwilling to continue to sell their lives for the Kuomintang bandit gang. A ship that arrived in Hong Kong from Fuzhou on the 28th carried sixty deserters from Guangdong.

　　广州匪帮加紧逃跑
    【新华社北平三十一日电】上海的迅速解放，引起广州国民党匪帮新的混乱。伪政府已令匪军在广州近郊挖掘战壕和建筑地堡。乘火车、轮船和飞机逃跑的匪帮官员较数日前更为增加。廿八日招商局轮船停泊在黄埔港等待载伪立委、伪监委和国民党中央党部人员去台湾。匪帮们又于廿七日以一小群伪立法委员的名义通过一项法案，企图利用战犯阎锡山所实行过的臭名昭著的“兵农合一”办法，残酷地榨取农民，和强迫他们当兵。国民党的“金圆券”在广州已一钱不值，市面普遍拒用。公教人员和一般薪资收入者的生活痛苦不堪。伪立法院员工千余人因要求发给应变费和调整薪资于二十三日起举行了四天的集体怠工。中山大学教授因无法生活，不得不靠拍卖衣物度日；为了表示对匪帮的抗议，教授们二十三日特别在伪教育部门前拍卖他们的家具和书籍。另息，驻守福州的国民党军队，因不愿继续为国民党匪帮卖命而大量逃亡。二十八日由福州开抵香港的一只轮船即载有广东籍的逃兵六十人。
