　　Zhengding Wheat Harvest Reaches Eighty to Ninety Percent
  　Masses Actively Select Wheat Seeds
    [Reported by Our Newspaper] The total wheat acreage in Zhengding County is over 166,000 mu (including 2,200 mu of dry land). The entire harvest was completed in seven days, with two-thirds already threshed. The harvest is generally rated at eighty to ninety percent of a normal year. The wheat is generally clean in color and the grains are full. According to surveys, the majority of irrigated land and low-lying areas yield 175 to 230 jin per mu. The highest yield in the alkaline land irrigated by the Liberation Canal in the Third District reached over 370 jin. Dry land and sandy land also yielded 125 to 150 jin, with even the worst land yielding around 100 jin. This is the result of efforts to develop water conservancy and irrigate the wheat six to eight times. In particular, the "72" wheat variety yielded an average of 300 jin. At the same time, its stiff stalks are resistant to wind, and it has strong resistance to jaundice and black rust. It has a thin skin and is of good quality. The masses in the Third and Fifth Districts are rushing to exchange for this superior variety in preparation for planting in the autumn. When the summer grain requisition work was implemented in the villages, the masses were very happy to hand over public grain and repay interest-free grain loans and waterwheel loans. (Yaofu)

  　群众积极选麦种
    【本报讯】正定全县小麦十六万六千余亩（内旱地二二○○亩），七天全部登场，并有三分之二已经打过，普遍达到八九成年景，一般色洁、粒饱，据调查一般水浇地与下阴地，绝大部分每亩产量一七五至二三○斤，三区解放渠浇过碱地最高到三七○余斤；旱地和带沙性水地亦达一二五至一五○斤，最坏者亦在百斤左右，这是由于努力开展水利小麦浇至六水至八水的结果。其中推广的“七二”小麦一般收到三百斤，同时，秸硬不怕风，抵抗黄疽黑疸力大，皮薄质好，三五区群众都抢着换下优良品种，准备秋后种植。当夏征工作布置到村，群众都非常喜欢的交公粮还无息贷粮、水车贷款等。　　　　　　　（药夫）
