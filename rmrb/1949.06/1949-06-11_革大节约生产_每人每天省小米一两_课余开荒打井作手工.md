　　Revolutionary University Promotes Production Through Thrift
  　Saving an Ounce of Millet Per Person Per Day
  　Opening Wasteland, Digging Wells, and Making Handicrafts in Spare Time
    [Ping City News] All students of the Revolutionary University, responding to the government's call, are practicing thrift. Every student in the school saves one ounce of millet and four ounces of coal per day, and pays attention to saving water and electricity, turning off the lights on time every day, and never wasting electricity. At the same time, they advocate simplicity and avoid wasting money. Now, a red flag competition is in full swing between classes and groups. In addition, more than 100 mu of wasteland has been opened up and planted with vegetables. To prevent drought, more than 160 wells have been dug. Recently, students have also been using their spare time to make handicrafts to subsidize their own production. (Fu Jinyu)
