From the Editor's Desk

　　People can't stand the ferocious "Voice of America," nor the decadent "American Tunes," because this is not "culture," but the wolf-like howling of new war instigators, and the anesthetizing melody that leads to depravity. This is the malicious and despicable creation of that small handful of reactionary ruling classes!

　　But America has genuine people's artists who come from the people and serve the people. The black singing king Paul Robeson is one of them. He sings not only for the millions of American workers, farmers, and black people who are ruled and enslaved, but also for Polish workers, for the working people of the Soviet Union, and for the proletariat of the world. From Robeson's songs, we see the true culture of America!

　　美国的文化
    人们听不惯恶狠狠的“美国之声”，也听不惯靡靡的“美国之音”，因为这不是“文化”，而是新战争挑拨者虎狼似的号叫，以及使人堕落的麻醉旋律。这是那一小撮反动统治阶级恶意而卑劣的制造品！
    但美国有真正来自人民、并为人民服务的人民艺术家，如黑人歌王罗伯逊便是其中的一个。他不仅为被统治被奴役的美国千万工人，农民，黑人而歌唱，他还为波兰工人、为苏联的劳动人民、为全世界的无产阶级而歌唱。从罗伯逊的歌声中，我们看到了美国真正的文化！
