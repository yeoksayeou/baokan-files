Xinhua News Agency, Peiping, June 18th: High-ranking members of American Progressive Unions have denounced the aggressive North Atlantic Treaty. Gold, president of the Fur and Leather Workers Union of the CIO, which has over 100,000 members, wrote in the union's monthly magazine: "The leadership of the CIO expressed its support for the North Atlantic Treaty without consulting the executive board. Before announcing the CIO's position on this extremely important issue, the senior members of the CIO did not even seek the opinions of the executive board members." Gold pointed out: "The Truman Doctrine, the Marshall Plan, the North Atlantic Treaty, and its supplementary facilities will sooner or later be judged by the American people. When the day of judgment arrives, union leaders will not be able to claim that they were merely uninvolved bystanders. The American people want peace, they will fight for peace, and they will preserve peace." At its recent national convention, the Farm Equipment and Metal Workers Union passed a resolution declaring that the North Atlantic Treaty demonstrates that the State Department is "prepared to implement a policy of war." The resolution calls for a return to Roosevelt's policy of cooperation with the Soviet Union. The resolution also stated: "We are determined to oppose any military pacts or other agreements that will trap us in war." The Food, Tobacco, and Agricultural Workers Union of the CIO, which has nearly 100,000 members, also passed a similar resolution explicitly demanding peace at its recent national convention. The union's president, Henderson, played an important role at the World Congress of Advocates for Peace in Paris. Local unions of the CIO, AFL, and independent unions have united in various regions to urge an end to the Cold War policy and a restoration of the policy of cooperation with the Soviet Union. A local union of the UAW-CIO in Detroit recently published an article on the front page of its newspaper, urging union members to make it clear to Congress that they oppose the North Atlantic Treaty.

    【新华社北平十八日电】塔斯社纽约十六日讯：美国进步工会的高级人员斥责侵略的北大西洋公约。拥有十万余会员的产联毛皮工会的主席高尔德在该工会月刊上写道：“产联的领导机关未经与执行局商议，即表示赞成北大西洋公约。产联高级人员在宣布产联的立场前，对于这个极端重要的问题，竟不曾征询执行局委员的意见。”高尔德指出：“杜鲁门主义，马歇尔计划，北大西洋公约及其补充设施，迟早是要受美国人民裁判的。当裁判的日子到来的时候，工会领袖们就不能扬言他们只是不曾与闻的旁观者了。美国人民要和平，他们将为和平而斗争，他们将保住和平。”农业装备与金属工人工会在最近召开的全国代表大会中，通过一项决议，宣称北大西洋公约表明国务院“准备执行战争政策”，决议号召回到罗斯福的与苏联合作的政策。决议并称：“我们决定，反对一切陷我们于战争中的军事公约或其他协定。”拥有会员近十万人的产联食品、烟草及农业工人工会在最近的全国代表大会中，亦通过同样明白的要求和平的决议。这个工会的主席韩德森前在巴黎世界拥护和平大会上曾起着重要的作用。产联、劳联和独立工会的地方工会已在各个地区联合一致，督促结束冷战政策与恢复对苏合作政策。底特律产联汽车工会的一个地方工会，最近在其机关报的第一版上发表论文，力促工会会员让国会清楚地知道他们是反对北大西洋公约的。
