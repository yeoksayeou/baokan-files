　　Mr. Shen Yanbing, representative of democratic figures in cultural circles, said:
    This conference was filled with the spirit of democracy and unity. After the Chinese Communist Party issued the May 1st call last year, cultural figures exiled in Hong Kong believed that holding such a democratic and united New Political Consultative Conference to create a people's democratic coalition government was fully in line with the demands and interests of the people and could build a new democratic China. Every sentence of Chairman Mao's speech at this conference spoke to the hearts of the common people. He finally told us that the focus of work after the establishment of the Chinese Democratic Coalition Government would be, first, to eliminate the remnants of the reactionaries and suppress the sabotage of the reactionaries; second, to do everything possible to use great strength to engage in the restoration and development of the people's economic undertakings, and at the same time, restore and develop the people's cultural and educational undertakings. Therefore, cultural figures have sufficient confidence that under the new democratic regime, cultural undertakings will surely be greatly developed, because the people's government supports progressive culture, and the liberated workers, peasants, and soldiers need culture, they can freely create and enjoy culture, and they will be the most promising new force in the cultural field.

　　文化界民主人士代表沈雁冰先生说：
    这次会议是充满了民主与团结的精神。在去年中国共产党发出了五一号召以后，那时流亡在香港的文化界人士都认为开这样民主团结的新政协，产生人民民主的联合政府，是完全符合于人民的要求和利益，可以建设新民主主义的新中国。毛主席在这次会议上的演说，每句话都是老百姓的心里话，他最后告诉我们说中国民主联合政府成立以后的工作重点，第一是肃清反动派的残余，镇压反动派的捣乱；第二是尽一切可能用极大力量从事人民经济事业的恢复和发展，同时恢复和发展人民的文化教育事业。文化界人士因此有足够的信心，在新民主主义政权下，文化事业一定会得到很大的发展，因为人民政府是扶植进步文化的，而且翻了身的工农兵，他们需要文化，他们能够自由地创作和享受文化，他们会是文化界最有希望的新生力量。
