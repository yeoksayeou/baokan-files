　　Notice from the Headquarters of the Pingjin Garrison Command of the Chinese People's Liberation Army
　　Recently, idle people often climb the city walls for sightseeing, which greatly affects the garrison's perimeter security. Furthermore, illegal activities such as stealing electrical wires and throwing bricks and stones at trains have frequently occurred. From now on, all idle people are prohibited from climbing the city walls for sightseeing. In addition to instructing the troops to pay attention to prevention, we hereby issue this notice.
