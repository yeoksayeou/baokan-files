　　【Our Newspaper】The North China People's Government issued a circular on June 16th, addressing the personnel responsible for the fire incident in the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant laboratory. According to the severity of their involvement, they were given appropriate punishments. Workers and security guards Liu Liang, Zhang Lian, Liang Zhanru, Jia Shilin, and others, who consciously protected the factory, bravely rescued people, and cared for the people's property, were commended in a public circular. Jin Huaizeng, the main person responsible for the fire and the head of the laboratory, has been dismissed from his post and transferred by the North China People's Government's Supervisory Yuan to the Beiping Municipal People's Court for interrogation. Chen Lei, the main person in charge sent by the Beiping Military Control Commission to take over the plant, has been dismissed by the Military Control Commission and is awaiting investigation and punishment.

　　The fire at the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant was caused on the night of May 25th by the high-temperature combustion of the housing from the muffle furnace. Afterwards, the North China People's Government, the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, the Beiping Municipal People's Government, the Beiping Municipal Public Security Bureau, and the Preparatory Committee of the Beiping Municipal Federation of Trade Unions, showed great concern and importance, and immediately sent personnel to conduct on-site investigations and urged the plant to quickly carry out the aftermath. On May 31st, Dong Biwu, Chairman of the North China People's Government, personally invited the heads of the above-mentioned agencies to hold a meeting to listen to the report by Li Gongda, the manager of the plant, on the course of the fire. Representatives from the Preparatory Committee of the Beiping Municipal Federation of Trade Unions and the Beiping Municipal People's Government Public Security Bureau, among others, also gave supplementary reports on the investigation and analysis of the cause of the fire. Staff members of the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant Trade Union reported at the meeting the workers' regret and indignation at the loss from the fire, exposed the bureaucratic work style of the plant's leadership, and demanded a thorough investigation of responsibility to improve the future management of the plant. The meeting decided that the Supervisory Yuan should send a supervisory commissioner to Shijingshan to conduct a detailed on-site investigation. After the preliminary draft of the investigation report was prepared, on June 9th, the North China People's Government again invited the heads of relevant agencies to conduct discussions. At the meeting, regarding the issue of punishing those responsible for the incident, it was unanimously agreed that the main responsibility and direct responsibility should be separated, and the purpose of punishment was for education, so that all staff and workers of the plant could be mobilized to create a plant protection movement. The meeting required the administrative heads of factory management to put down the airs of intellectuals, be with the workers, unite with the workers, and rely on the workers; the workers should strictly enforce labor discipline, so that the factory could be guaranteed to prevent similar incidents from happening in the future.

　　On June 12th, the drafting committee of the investigation report held a meeting. Liu Ding, Deputy Minister of the Public Enterprises Department, made a self-criticism at the meeting, pointing out that the Enterprise Department had not conducted in-depth inspections of the plant's takeover work and the establishment of the North China Iron and Steel Company, and in particular, had not promptly helped the factory leaders solve various difficulties in administrative management. The Enterprise Department should be held responsible. On June 14th, the joint office meeting of the ministers of the North China People's Government discussed the revised draft of the report drafting committee and unanimously agreed with the report's conclusions. Vice Chairman Lan Gongwu pointed out at the meeting: Each factory under the Public Enterprises Department should have a special agency of the safety committee, with dedicated personnel responsible for conducting regular inspections of various safety equipment in the factory. Senior administrative and engineering personnel in the factory must sweep away the bureaucratic bad habits of enterprise management from the past Kuomintang era, and conduct careful and strict inspections of the safety equipment of the projects they are responsible for, to protect the people's property from loss. The meeting pointed out: After the order of the North China People's Government is issued, the work of the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant should be greatly improved. In order to mobilize all workers and staff, in addition to educating factory management personnel, special attention must also be paid to education work among workers. The meeting required all government personnel, especially those in charge of warehouses and factories, to be vigilant, and all agency offices and dormitories must pay close attention to preventing fires and strengthen the protection of people's property, rectifying discipline. This has the practical significance of thrift and construction. The property of our country and people must not suffer such losses again. The meeting decided that the Legislative Affairs Commission should discuss with the Financial and Economic Commission to draft regulations on preventing fire damage to factory equipment.

　　华北人民政府经多次调查
  　石景山失火案已获解决
    肇事人员分别轻重予以处分
  　工人保卫队员刘良等获嘉奖
    【本报讯】华北人民政府于六月十六日发出通令，对石景山钢铁厂化验室失火事件应负责的人员，按照情节轻重，分别予以处分；对自觉保卫工厂，奋勇抢救、爱护人民财产的工人保卫队员刘良、张连、梁占如、贾士林等则予通令嘉奖。失火案主要负责人化验室主管人晋怀曾已撤职，并由华北人民政府监察院移交北平市人民法院讯办。北平市军管会派往该厂接管的主要负责人陈雷则由军管会予以撤职听候查办处分。
    石景山钢铁厂的火灾是在五月二十五日夜因焖炉高温燃烧房屋所造成。事后，华北人民政府、中华全国总工会、北平市人民政府、北平市公安局及北平市职工总会筹委会等，极为关怀与重视，当即分别派员前往实地进行调查，并督促该厂迅速进行善后事宜。五月三十一日，华北人民政府董必武主席亲自邀集上述各机关负责人举行会议，听取该厂经理李公达关于火灾经过的报告。北平市职工总会筹委会及北平市人民政府公安局等代表，并将关于此次火灾原因的调查分析，作了补充报告。石景山钢铁厂职工会工作人员，在会议上报告了工人对于失火损失的惋惜和愤慨，揭发该厂领导上的官僚主义作风，要求彻底追究责任，以改进今后工厂管理。会议决定由监察院派监察专员赴石景山进行详细的实地调查。调查报告初步草拟后，六月九日，又由华北人民政府邀集有关机关负责人进行讨论。会上对于负肇事责任的人的处分问题，一致认为应将主要责任和直接责任分开，处分目的是为了教育，应使该厂全体职员及工人都积极起来，造成护厂运动，会议要求工厂管理行政负责人，必须放下知识分子的架子与工人在一起，团结工人，依靠工人，发动工人；工人则应严肃劳动纪律，这样才能使工厂防止今后发生同类事件得有保证。
    六月十二日，调查报告起草委员会举行会议，公营企业部刘鼎副部长在会议上作了自我批评，指出企业部对该厂接管工作及成立华北钢铁公司后，未能深入检查，特别是没有及时帮助工厂负责人解决行政管理上的各种困难问题，企业部应当负责。六月十四日，华北人民政府各部长联合办公会议讨论。报告起草委员会的修正稿，一致同意报告结论，蓝公武副主席在会上指出：公营企业部所属各工厂，要有一个安全委员会的专门机构，设有专人负责，进行工厂各种安全设备的随时检查。工厂高级行政与工程人员，必须一扫过去国民党时代企业管理官僚化的恶习，谨慎严密进行检查自己负责的工程的安全设备，以保护人民的财产不受损失。会议指出：华北人民政府命令下达后，应该使石景山钢铁厂的工作得到大步改进，为使工人及职员全体动员起来，除教育工厂管理人员外，还必须特别注意工人中的教育工作。会议要求所有政府人员，特别是负责仓库、工厂者应提高警惕，各机关办公室、宿舍，全要很好注意防止火灾，加强保护人民财产，整顿纪律。这就有节约与建设的实际意义，我们国家人民的财产，不能再遭受这样的损失了。会议决定由法制委员会商同财经委员会起草关于防止工厂设备等发生火灾损失的法规。
