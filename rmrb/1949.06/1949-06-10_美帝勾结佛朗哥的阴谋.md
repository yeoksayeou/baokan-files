US Imperialism's Conspiracy to Collude with Franco
      Shen Yu
   Under the imperialist bloc's active deployment of new war conspiracies, the collusion between US imperialism and Franco's Spain has become increasingly apparent.
   　I. Economic and Military Reasons for US Imperialism's Collusion with Franco
    The collusion between the imperialist bloc and the Franco regime must first be explored from their economic causes.
    Spain possesses many strategic materials needed for modern warfare, and these resources, after the collapse of the German and Italian fascists, have successively passed into the hands of the United States, Britain, and other countries. American monopoly capital now occupies the first place in the Spanish economy. Its monopoly enterprises established in Spain, such as: Iberia Motor Company, belonging to the Ford system, monopolizes the manufacture of light and heavy vehicles in Spain; Standard Electric Company, belonging to the Morgan Group, the establishment of the national telecommunications network in Spain is entirely monopolized by this company; Armstrong Cork Company, controls the entire manufacture and export of cork in Spain. In addition, steelmaking, copper smelting, and arms manufacturing are almost all controlled by American and British imperialism.
    US imperialism needs Spain as its military base, which is the second reason for its active assistance to Franco.
    Spain guards the western entrance of the Mediterranean Sea and is strategically very important. US imperialism has long taken a fancy to this military springboard, preparing to use it in future wars of aggression.
    The mountainous terrain inside Spain is a barrier for air force bases. At the end of World War II, the United States, on the condition of improving Spanish airports, obtained the right to land its military transport aircraft anywhere in Spain. At that time, Franco, seeing that the old master had collapsed, agreed decisively in order to win the favor of US imperialism. Now this agreement is still valid, and US imperialism is currently building a large aviation network on the Iberian Peninsula based on this; and training aircraft pilots for Franco. The Franco regime's air force has since been incorporated into the US Department of Defense system.
    Spain has many coastal bays, and there are some islands in the Mediterranean that can be used as naval bases. Recently, the United States and Spain, after secret consultations, have concluded an agreement. According to this agreement, the United States will send a naval mission to help Franco rebuild its ports to expand their throughput; Spain will lease the island of Menorca in the Mediterranean (in the Balearic Islands) to the United States to establish naval and air force bases for a term of twenty-five years.
   　II. Facts of US Imperialism's Collusion with Franco
    We know that since the San Francisco Conference in 1945, the United Nations organizations, under the insistence of democratic countries such as the Soviet Union, Poland, and Czechoslovakia, have not only morally and politically condemned the Franco fascist regime; but also passed resolutions at the two UN General Assemblies in 1946 and 1947, ordering all member states to withdraw their diplomatic envoys stationed in Madrid; and calling on the Spanish people to overthrow the fascist regime and rebuild a democratic system. At that time, under the high pressure of world democratic forces, US imperialism was forced to accept the General Assembly resolutions on the surface.
    But the facts have proved that US imperialism completely disregards the UN General Assembly resolutions; and clearly stands on the side of sympathizing with the Franco regime.
    First, although the US ambassador to Spain was recalled to Washington, there was still a "chargé d'affaires" stationed in Madrid. At the same time, temporary "envoys" were constantly dispatched in various ways to conduct secret diplomacy with Franco. Last spring, Truman's personal representative to the Vatican, Taylor, discussed with Franco the issue of "Spain's position in the event of an East-West war"; last year, when the United States was preparing to include Spain in the Marshall Plan, US Republican Senator Garner and former Democratic Party Chairman Farley both "visited" Madrid to assist Franco. These facts show that the substantive diplomatic relations between the United States and Spain have not been severed at all.
    Second, US imperialism is actively providing loans to the Franco regime and instructing its vassal states to conclude various agreements with it. Recently, Chase Bank gave Spain a loan in a secret manner; in early May this year, the US State Department notified the Spanish government that it could apply for a loan from the US Export-Import Bank, which is done openly. In addition to the above two secret and open methods, US imperialism also adopts a transfer loan method, that is, the US imperialism first lends to the "recipient countries" of the Marshall Plan, and then they transfer the loans to Franco. The recent Italian loan to Spain is of this nature.
    In addition to directly lending to support Franco, US imperialism is also encouraging Britain and France to establish economic relations with Spain. For example, the Anglo-Spanish monetary agreement, the Franco-Spanish economic agreement, and the reopening of the Franco-Spanish border by France are all the result of US imperialism's instructions.
    Third, US imperialism has recently openly called for promoting the Franco regime onto the international political stage.
    On the one hand, at the recently concluded third second session of the United Nations General Assembly, it instigated Brazil, Peru, and other countries to come forward and propose a reactionary proposal, that is, member states can "act freely" in handling diplomatic relations with Franco's Spain. To put it another way, this proposal means that all countries can freely tear up the previous resolutions of the UN General Assembly and freely resume diplomatic relations with the Franco regime. This absurd proposal, under the instigation of US imperialism, was once passed by the Political Committee of the UN General Assembly, but after fierce attacks by representatives of democratic countries such as the Soviet Union, Poland, and Czechoslovakia, it was ultimately rejected by the General Assembly.
    On the other hand, the US Senate and the State Department have also recently publicly expressed their desire to resume diplomatic relations with Spain. On May 10, Connally, chairman of the US Senate Foreign Relations Committee, requested the exchange of ambassadors with Spain, and said: "We cannot find any reason not to restore full diplomatic relations with Spain." US Secretary of State Acheson also publicly reiterated Connally's opinion, saying: "The policy of the United States is to bring Spain back to the Western countries group."
    The absurd proposal at the UN General Assembly and the obvious arguments of the US diplomatic authorities are in sharp contrast, and basically cannot conceal the political collusion between US imperialism and the Franco regime. From sneaking around to being blatant.
    However, the conspiracy of US imperialism to collude with Franco to deploy a new war has been resolutely opposed by the broad masses of the Spanish people under the leadership of the Spanish Communist Party and peace-loving and democratic people all over the world, and its failure is doomed.

　　美帝勾结佛朗哥的阴谋
      沈予
   在帝国主义集团积极布置新战争的阴谋下，美帝和佛朗哥西班牙的勾结，已经日趋明显起来。 　　一、美帝勾结佛朗哥之经济的及军事的原因
    帝国主义集团和佛朗哥政权的勾结，必须先从它们经济上探索原因。
    西班牙拥有很多现代战争所需要的战略物资，而这些资源在德意法西斯垮台以后，已先后转入美英等国手中。美国的垄断资本在西班牙的经济中现占第一位它在西班牙设立的垄断企业如：伊伯利安汽车公司，属于福特系，独占西班牙轻重汽车的制造；标准电气公司，属于摩根集团，西班牙全国电讯网的建立，全部垄断在这个公司的手中；阿姆斯特朗苦克公司，控制着整个西班牙软木的制造与输出。此外炼钢、冶铜以及军火制造业，差不多也都控制在美英帝国主义的掌握里。
    美帝需要西班牙做为它的军事基地，是它积极援助佛朗哥的第二个原因。
    西班牙守卫着地中海的西端入口，在战略上的地位十分重要。美帝早已相中了这块军事跳板，准备在未来侵略战争中使用。
    西班牙内部山地崎岖，正是空军基地的屏障。第二次世界大战结束时，美国曾以改善西班牙机场为条件，取得在西境任何地方降落其军运机的权利。当时佛朗哥看到旧主人已经垮台，为赢得美帝欢心便毅然同意下来。现在这项协议仍然有效，美帝目下正据此在伊伯利安半岛上大建航空网；并为佛朗哥训练飞机驾驶员。佛朗哥政权的空军便从此纳入美国国防部体制之下了。
    西班牙沿海港湾很多，地中海中又有一些可作海军基地的岛屿，最近，美西经过秘密磋商，已经成立了一项协议。根据这个协议，由美国派遣海军使节团替佛朗哥重建各海港，以扩充其吞吐量；西班牙则将地中海的密诺卡岛（在巴利阿利群岛中）租给美国建立海空军基地，租期二十五年。
   　二、美帝勾结佛朗哥的事实
    我们知道，联合国机构从一九四五年的旧金山会议起，在苏联、波兰、捷克等民主国家坚持下，不仅在道义上和政治上斥责过佛朗哥法西斯政权；而且在一九四六和四七年的两次联大上通过的决议，通令所有会员国撤回驻玛德里的外交使节；并唤起西班牙人民推翻法西斯政权，重建民主制度。当时美帝国主义在世界民主力量高压下，迫使它不得不在表面上接受大会决议。
    但事实证明了美帝国主义完全轻视联大决议；并且明显地站在同情佛朗哥政权的立场上。
    第一、美国驻西大使虽然调回了华盛顿，但是仍旧有“代办”驻在玛德里。同时又不断地以各种不同方式派遣临时“使节”和佛朗哥进行秘密外交。去年春季杜鲁门驻梵蒂冈私人代表戴勒就和佛朗哥商谈过“一旦东西战争爆发时西班牙的地位”问题；去年美国准备将西班牙列入马歇尔计划时，美国共和党参议员格纳、前民主党主席费里都为援助佛朗哥“访问”过玛德里。这些事实说明了美西实质上的外交关系根本没有断绝。
    第二、美帝在积极方面更向佛朗哥政权贷款并指使其附庸国和它缔结各种协定。最近，美国大通银行曾给予西班牙贷款，方式是秘密的；今年五月初美国国务院通知西政府可向美进出口银行进行贷款，这种方式是公开的。除以上秘密和公开两种，美帝还采取一种转贷方式，即先由美帝贷款给马歇尔计划的“受援国”，再由它们转贷给佛朗哥。最近意大利对西班牙的贷款便是这种性质。
    美帝除直接贷款支持佛朗哥外，还怂恿英法和西班牙建立经济关系、例如英西货币协定，法西的经济协定以及法国重开法西边境等等，莫不是美帝指使的结果。
    第三、美帝最近更公开地号召把佛朗哥政权捧上国际政治舞台。
    一方面，在日前闭幕的第三届第二次联合国大会上，它唆使巴西、秘鲁等国出面，提出一项反动建议，即各会员国在处理佛朗哥西班牙外交关系时，可以“自由行动”。这个建议换一个说法，就是各国都可以随意撕毁联大以前的决议，自由地和佛朗哥政权复交。这项荒谬建议，在美帝策动下，曾经通过了联大的政治委会，不过经苏联、波兰、捷克各民主国家代表猛烈攻击，终为大会否决掉。
    另一方面，美国参议院和国务院最近也公开地唱出了和西班牙复交的调子。五月十日美国参院外交委会主席康纳利要求和西班牙互派大使，而且说：“我们找不出任何理由，不能与西班牙恢复充分的外交关系。”美国务卿艾奇逊也公开重申康纳利的意见说：“美国的政策，在使西班牙重返西方国家集团”。
    联大上的荒谬建议和美国外交当局昭然若揭的论调两相对照，基本上已经掩饰不了美帝和佛朗哥政权，在政治上的勾结。由偷偷摸摸到明目张胆。
    可是，美帝勾结佛朗哥以布置新战争的阴谋，遭受西班牙国内在西共领导下的广大民众、及全世界爱好和平民主的人民所坚决反对，其失败是注定了的。
