    Shengfang State-Run Yufeng Store
    Organizes Disaster Area Masses to Produce
    Low-Price Reed Supply, High-Price Mat Purchase
    [Jizhong Telegram] Most of the residents in the eastern villages of Wangkou, Jinghai County, rely on weaving mats for a living. However, due to last year's flood and this year's spring famine, most mat weavers have no money to buy reeds for weaving, making their livelihoods very difficult. The Shengfang State-Run Yufeng Store then supplied raw materials (reeds) to the mat weavers and promoted their finished products (mats). From May 10th to 25th, it supplied 1,120 large reeds to seven villages including Xishan and Minzhu, producing 6,720 mats. Each mat weaver received enough reeds to weave six mats, but only returned three, with the remaining three belonging to the weaver. Then, the state-run store purchased the mats at a price higher than the market price, allowing the weavers to earn more profit. For example, on May 29th at the Wangkou market, a standard full-size mat was generally priced at 270 yuan, but the state-run store purchased them for 300 yuan (equivalent to 8.5 jin of corn). In order to improve the skills of the mat weavers, it was stipulated that a bonus of 20 yuan would be added for each mat exceeding the standard quality. The store also supplied food grain to the mat weavers at a price lower than the market price, averaging 1,400 to 1,500 jin of coarse grain per market day, and has already supplied it for three market days.

    组织灾区群众生产
    低价供苇高价收席
    【冀中电】静海县王口东部村庄居民多数依靠织席为生，但因去年水灾，今年春荒，多数席民已无钱买苇织席，生活很成问题。胜芳国营裕丰商店遂供给席民原料（苇子），并推销其成品（席子），自五月十日至二十五日共供给西山、民主等七个村庄大苇一千一百二十个，织出席六千七百二十片。每个席民分到的苇子能织六片席，但只交回三片，其余三片归席民所有；然后国营商店以高于市价收购，使席民获利更多。如五月二十九日王口集上，一般的足尺丈席二百七十元，国营商店即作价三百元进行收购（合玉米八斤半）。为了提高席民技术，规定凡超过标准的质量，每片席外加奖金二十元，并低于市价供给席民食粮，平均每集供给粗粮一千四、五百斤，现已供给三个集了。
