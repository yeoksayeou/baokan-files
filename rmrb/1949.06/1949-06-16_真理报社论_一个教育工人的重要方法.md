  　An Important Method for Educating Workers
　　The general assembly of workers and staff is one of the most obvious manifestations of Soviet socialist democracy.

　　The significance of the general assembly in the process of building socialism is enormous. The general assembly can not only correctly educate the worker masses, but also correctly educate the leading personnel of our enterprises and agencies. Comrade Stalin once pointed out: "At any mass meeting where non-Party comrades participate in listening to the work reports of their leaders, the non-Party masses can give play to the activism of non-Party comrades, and conduct a check on the leaders of trade unions and other group organizations that are related to their lives, criticize shortcomings in their work, and point out ways to correct these shortcomings."

　　Now, as the Soviet people, under the leadership of the Lenin-Stalin Party, are systematically and step-by-step embarking on the road from socialism to communism, the significance of the general assembly is even more prominent. In our struggle to realize a communist society, the socialist consciousness of the broad masses of working people plays a decisive role. Precisely because the mass assembly is a school for communist education, its convocation can further raise the level of socialist consciousness of the worker masses and their enthusiasm in the struggle for communism.

　　When explaining the decisions of the Party and the government and important issues of the domestic and international situation, the role played by the general assembly of workers and staff is greater than that played by other methods. The general assembly is a school for educating the laboring masses in the spirit of Soviet patriotism and unlimited loyalty to the great cause of Lenin and Stalin.

　　The Soviet people are using all their strength to complete the new post-war Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule. Comrade Molotov once said: "...The idea of completing the Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule has penetrated into the consciousness of the working class." At the general assembly, the workers and staff of our enterprises and agencies collectively searched for and found all the new and new internal reserves that could be used to exceed the tasks stipulated in the Five-Year Plan, expressed their patriotic suggestions, and criticized all the shortcomings that hinder our progress.

　　In various enterprise departments and agencies, the preparation for and mastery of the general assembly is the responsibility of the trade union organization. However, such a work of great importance must not be left to the trade union alone. The Party and Communist Youth League organizations, as well as the leading comrades of various enterprise departments and agencies, should directly participate in the preparation and leadership of the general assembly. Experience has shown that if the Party organization and those organizations related to the life of the workers do not participate in the preparation and leadership of the general assembly, then it will inevitably lead to a decline in the level of the assembly and the active emotions of the participants.

　　We can take the "Red Ridge" factory in Yaroslavl as an example. In this factory, the workers' congress is held irregularly and is accidental. The so-called preparation for the congress is only to write a notice by the factory committee the day before the meeting, and even this is often not done. As a result of such preparation, the number of people who regularly participate in the congress only accounts for a small half of the factory's workers. The situation in the automobile factory in Shirbaikov City is exactly the same. The congress there is held extremely hastily, during lunch breaks or during "shift meetings." Important issues such as the work summary of the workshop for the previous month or the work tasks for the next month are often resolved at the workshop congress. However, because most of these congresses are neither recorded nor the opinions of the workers written down, many valuable opinions are forgotten, and the workers lose interest in such congresses.

　　Such things can no longer be tolerated. Work must be done to the point where every worker or staff member, after attending the meeting, can further and more clearly realize his own role and his own tasks as a participant in the construction of a communist society. The Party organization should be able to guarantee that the congress is held at a high political and ideological level, and should be able to guarantee that in addition to discussing production issues, general political issues are also systematically discussed at the congress. The task of the Party organization is to point out and explain to the worker masses the great organizational role of the Lenin-Stalin Party in our country's struggle to build communism. Pointing out and explaining the facts that prove that our country's economic strength is growing, the material enjoyment of the workers is improving, and the friendship and family-like cooperation of the various ethnic groups in the Soviet Union is being consolidated, and raising such political issues, can promote and help the communist education of the workers, and is an important method for them to become familiar with the ideals and policies of the Bolshevik Party.

　　The discussion of political and daily life issues, as well as open and bold criticism and self-criticism of the shortcomings that exist in daily life and general group activities, will further improve the political enthusiasm and labor enthusiasm of the worker masses, and will further improve the sense of responsibility of workers and staff for completing and exceeding the new post-war Five-Year Plan.

　　In various state agencies, the mission of the general assembly is to educate staff in the spirit of strict adherence to the state system and close attention to the demands of the laboring masses. Here, sharp criticism and self-criticism should be used to oppose bureaucracy, to oppose financial and official waste, to oppose those shortcomings that hinder orderly agency work, to establish Bolshevik order in various state agencies, and to establish a strict system of economy.

　　In order to make the resolutions of the general assembly have prestige among workers and staff, it is necessary to ensure that these resolutions play a practical role. Those opinions put forward by workers and staff that have been adopted by the congress in order to eliminate shortcomings should be written into the resolutions of the congress. At the next congress, the leading comrades of the trade union and other organizations related to the life of the workers should report on the things that have been done in order to implement the resolutions of the previous congress. This is the Bolshevik's proper attitude towards criticism and the opinions put forward by workers and staff.

　　In the "Kalinin" factory in Krasnodar, the general assembly of workers and staff has become an indispensable part of the factory's collective life - whether in the collective life at work or in the collective life at ordinary times. In this factory, the congress is prepared extremely carefully, so the congress is held extremely regularly, and due to the high degree of enthusiasm and Bolshevik criticism, it is extremely successful. It is not surprising that the "Kalinin" factory has become one of the advanced factories in Krasnodar! In the Lviv electric light factory, the general assembly is also held at a high political level. Every congress held in this factory can further improve every worker's feeling of being the master of socialist production and the worker. At one of the factory's general assemblies, Comrade Marchitsky, a worker who calibrates compound automatic rifles, clearly reflected the general mood of the congress participants. He said:

　　"I still remember the past. In the past, when we were ruled by capitalists, workers had no rights. Now we are the masters of our own destiny. Let us work like masters, let us work as the Bolshevik Party and Comrade Stalin taught us. I will take it as my responsibility to do what a master of the country and a Soviet citizen should do: to do the work of two compound workbenches well and to help other young calibration workers to do the work of two or more workbenches well."

　　Improving the role of the general assembly of various enterprises and state agencies should be one of the things that the Party organization, the trade union organization, and all economic work leading comrades should always care about.

　　In the struggle to complete the new post-war Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule, convening the general assembly of workers and staff is a very effective method. Strengthening the leadership of the general assembly is an important task of the Party and trade union organizations in various industrial enterprises and state agencies.

  　一个教育工人的重要方法
    工人和职员的全体大会是表示苏联社会主义民主的最明显的现象之一。
    全体大会在建设社会主义过程中的意义是巨大的。全体大会不但能正确地教育工人群众，而且也能正确地教育我们各企业和各机关的领导人员。斯大林同志曾指出：“在有着非党员同志参加听取自己的领导者所作的工作报告的任何一个群众性的会议上，非党群众能发挥非党员同志的积极性，而把那些与自己生活有关系的、职工会的，以及其他团体组织的领导人员加以一番检查，批评他们工作上的缺点，并且指出改正这些缺点的道路。”
    现在，正当苏联人民在列宁斯大林党的领导下，有计划有步骤地走上由社会主义进入到共产主义这一道路的时候，全体大会的意义更显得特别大了。在我们为实现共产主义社会而作的奋斗中，广大劳动群众的社会主义的觉悟程度是起着决定性的作用的。正因为群众大会是一所共产主义教育的学校，所以它的召开就能把工人群众的社会主义的觉悟水准以及他们在为共产主义而奋斗时的积极性更为提高一步。
    在解释党和政府的决议以及解释国内外形势的重要问题时，工人和职员的全体大会所起的作用是比用其他方法所起的作用更为巨大的。全体大会是一所以苏维埃爱国主义的精神和无限忠诚于伟大的列宁斯大林事业的精神来教育劳动群众的学校。
    苏联人民正在用着一切力量来提前完成战后的新五年计划。莫洛托夫同志曾说过：“……提前完成五年计划的想法，已经深入到工人阶级的思想意识中去了。”我们各企业和各机关的工人和职员，在全体大会上集体地寻找了而且也找到了所有能用来超过完成五年计划所规定的任务的一切新而又新的内部的后备力量，发表了自己的爱国的建议，批评了所有阻碍我们前进的一切缺点。
    在各企业部门和各机关中，对全体大会的准备和掌握本是职工会组织份内应做的事情。但是决不能把这样一个有着巨大重要意义的工作只交给职工会来做。对全体大会的准备工作和掌握领导工作，党和共青团的组织以及各企业部门和各机关的领导同志是应该直接参加的。经验证明：要是党的组织和那些与职工生活有关系的组织不参加全体大会的准备工作和掌握领导工作的话，那末这是一定会使得大会的水平和大会参加者的积极情绪低落下去的。
    我们可以把雅洛斯拉夫利的“红岭”制造厂提出来当作一个例子来看。在这制造厂中，工人大会的举行是不规则的，是偶然性的。所谓大会的准备工作，只是由制造厂的委员会在开会的前一天写一个通知而已，而且即使连这一点也是常常做不到的。这样的准备工作的结果，使经常参加大会的人数只占全厂工人一小半。史赤尔拜柯夫城的汽车工厂的情形也正是这样。那儿的大会是极轻率地举行的，是在午饭的休息时间内或是在“换班的会面”时举行的。在工作间的大会上常解决着象工作间上一个月的工作总结或下一个月的工作任务这样重要的问题。但是由于大多数这样的大会既不记录，也不把工人所提的意见写下来的缘故，很多宝贵的意见都被遗忘了，而工人也就对这样的大会丧失了兴趣。
    对于这样的事情是决不能再容忍下去了。必须把工作做到这一地步：当每一个工人或职员在开完会后，他能更进一步地更明确地认识到作为一个共产主义社会建设的参加者的他自己的作用和他自己的任务。党的组织应该是能保证在很高的政治思想水平上来举行大会的，应该是能保证在大会上除了讨论生产方面的问题外还能有系统地讨论一般政治方面的问题的。党的组织的任务是：把列宁斯大林党在我国建设共产主义的斗争中的伟大的组织作用，向工人群众指出和说明。把证明着我国经济力量在生长，工人的物质享受在提高和苏联各族人民的友谊和一家人似的合作在巩固等情形的事实，给以指出和说明，把这种政治性的问题提出来，是能对工人的共产主义教育起推动帮助作用的，是一个使他们能熟悉布尔塞维克党的理想和政策的重要方法。
    对政治问题和日常生活问题的讨论以及对存在在日常生活中和一般团体活动中的缺点的公开大胆的批评和自我批评，将使工人群众的政治积极性和劳动积极性更为提高，将使工人和职员对完成和超过战后新五年计划的责任心更为提高。
    在各国家机关中，全体大会的使命，是在于以严格遵守国家制度的精神和对劳动群众要求予以密切关注的精神来教育工作人员。这里就应该用尖锐的批评和自我批评来反对官僚主义，来反对财政上和公务上的浪费，来反对那些妨碍井然有序的机关工作的缺点，来建立各国家机关中的布尔什维克秩序，来建立严格的节约制度。
    为了使得全体大会的决议在工人和职员中具有威信，必需做到使这些决议发挥实际的作用来。那些由工人和职员所提出来而又已为大会所通过的为了消除缺点的意见，应该写到大会的决议上去。在下一次的大会上，职工会的以及其他与职工生活有关组织的领导同志就应该来报告为了实现上次大会的决议而已经办好的事情。这也就是布尔什维克对批评以及工人和职员所提意见的应有态度。
    在克拉斯诺达尔的“加里宁”工厂中，工人和职员的全体大会已经成为工厂的集体生活中——不论是在工作时的集体生活中，也不论是在平时的集体生活中——不可或缺的一部分了。在这工厂中对大会是准备得极为仔细的，因此大会是举行得极有规律的，而且由于有着高度的积极性和布尔什维克式的批评的缘故，是显得极为成功的。“加里宁”工厂的能成为克拉斯诺达尔先进工厂中的一个，是毫不足为奇的！在立沃夫电灯工厂中，全体大会也是在很高的政治水平上举行的。在这工厂举行的每个大会都能把每个工人的社会主义生产的主人翁和劳动者的感觉更为提高一步。在有一次工厂的全体大会上，复合自动步枪的校准工人玛尔奇茨基同志很明白地反映出了大会参加者的一般情绪。他说：
    “我还记得过去的情形。在过去被资本家所统治的时候，工人是没有什么权利的。现在我们是自己命运的主人。让我们来象主人翁似地工作吧，让我们来象布尔塞维克党和斯大林同志所教导我们的那样工作吧。我将作为一个国家主人和苏联公民的人所应该做的：把做好两个复合工作台的工作和做到帮助其他青年校准工人来做好两个或两个以上工作台的工作的这二件事情拿来作为我应尽的责任。”
    提高各企业和各国家机关的全体大会的作用，应该是党的组织，职工会组织和所有经济工作的领导同志都要经常关心的事情之一。
    在为了提前完成战后新五年计划这一任务而作的斗争中，召开工人和职员的全体大会是一个收效极大的方法。加强对全体大会的领导，是一个在各工业企业部门和各国家机关中的党的组织和职工会组织的重要的任务。
