    The Restoration and Reconstruction of the Longyan Iron Mine
    By our reporter Li Yi
    The Longyan Iron Mine is located in the counties of Xuanhua, Longguan, and Huailai in the southeastern part of Chahar Province. Its total reserves are more than 420 million tons, ranking first in North China. The ore is layered, sandwiched between Sinian quartzite and siliceous limestone, with one to three layers, and an average thickness ranging from 1.14 to 3.42 meters. The iron content is generally above 53 percent, with the highest reaching 61.37 percent. During the period of Japanese occupation, annual production reached more than 720,000 tons.
    Bearing the great historical mission of building China's industry, the 1,600 employees of the Longyan Iron Mine, with their collective wisdom and skilled, powerful hands, have rebuilt the Longyan Iron Mine from ruins in the more than half a year since its liberation.
    The Longyan before liberation was in a state of serious paralysis; the current Longyan has restored its vitality and youthful vigor.
    The biggest difficulty encountered in the initial stage of the restoration work of the Longyan Iron Mine was the extreme shortage of tools, machine tools, mining air compressors, mine cars, and other equipment. During the two years that the Kuomintang ruled Longyan, they did everything they could to plunder the mine's various facilities. Various types of power engines, air compressors, winches, mine cars, rails, and various machine tools used for mining were either dismantled or stolen. Most of the ore mined by the workers during the first liberation was also transported away by them for their steel and iron production, which was used to slaughter the people.
    Workers Li Shenchen and Wu Qingsheng described the situation of the Longyan Machine Factory at the time of liberation: "When we were first liberated, the machine factory, which occupied more than 100 mu of land, had only two complete lathes and one electric saw. The power used was only enough for seven and a half horsepower. The entire sand casting workshop had only one half-ton rotten cast iron furnace. Ordinary tools used by hand, such as taps and dies, bevel squares, and wire pliers, were very few." However, this situation did not make them lose confidence in resuming work. Their memories of hunger and crying years became the "internal combustion engine" that drove them to actively resume production after being liberated.
    Meng Xiantong and 15 other workers from the sand casting workshop of the machine factory restored a large sand casting workshop to its state during the first liberation in less than a month after liberation. They made enough sandboxes, repaired the electric grinding machine, reconfigured the 7.5-horsepower blower and charging tower for the cast iron furnace, and sifted out the sand buried under wood chips and garbage. From early April to early June, they and the workers from other workshops have assembled more than 100 mine cars for the mining site, and in June they are working hard to recast 600 mine car wheels.
    In the blacksmith shop and machine shop, the workers fought countless tenacious battles against the difficulties of various equipment and raw materials. In order to support the repair work of small rails for the Yantongshan mining site, they collected various scrap iron scattered around the factory, made more than 10,000 spikes, and saved more than 200 five-fen iron rods of five meters long. Axle heads and rail heads that had been abandoned on the ground for many years became their only raw materials for配制 various machine tools. In the past, square shafts for mine cars required ball bearings, but now, due to the lack of ball bearings, they have switched to using滚键. Not long ago, the workers used rolling barrels filled with refractory brick powder to replace the unavailable sandpaper, polishing the 滚键 found in the dirt piles that were enough for 400 mine cars, which was 30 times faster than manual rubbing with sandpaper.
    Young ironworker Wu Qingsheng and his companions Sun Rui, Ren Shuangjiang, and others could only make 20 five-fen nuts a day during the Kuomintang bandit gang's rule; after liberation, thanks to their active research, they have increased this to 220. The ironworker foreman Li Shenchen directly controlled a blacksmith furnace, and during the Kuomintang bandit gang's rule, three people could only make six iron rakes for iron mining a day, which has now increased to 30. In the first half of June, in addition to completing normal production tasks, they additionally made 3,000 fishplate screws.
    This astonishing increase in quantity is due to the fundamental change in their political mood. Wu Qingsheng said: "During the rule of the Kuomintang bandit gang, we couldn't even get enough to eat and could be arrested at any time. Who would have the heart to work! At that time, everyone usually arrived late and left early, or even if they didn't leave, they would rest in the workshop or pick up coal cinders outside the workshop. As soon as they heard the manager's car coming, they would quickly do a few things, and as soon as they heard the car leaving, they would stop working as usual."
    Now, the workers in the machine factory have restored the positive working mood they had during the first liberation in 1946. If there are no tools, they use their hands to make them; if there are no machine tools, they use scrap iron to assemble them. Thanks to the efforts of all the staff and workers, in the past two and a half months, the machine factory itself has increased the number of machine tools such as lathes, planers, and 元车 from two to fifteen when it was first liberated, providing the most basic conditions for the Longyan Iron Mine's massive reconstruction project.
    Yantongshan, located ten kilometers northeast of Xuanhua City, is currently the main mining site of the Longyan Mine. It was shut down at the end of the Japanese occupation, and most of the mining equipment was moved elsewhere or destroyed. During the Kuomintang bandit gang's rule, there were more than 140 miners who only selected old stockpiles of ore and did not carry out any mining. After this liberation, the Public Enterprise Department of the North China People's Government, in order to provide the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant with sufficient ore, began a large-scale reconstruction project. In the past six months, the number of miners at this site has increased from more than 140 to more than 1,200. The rails, electric lights, and other equipment in the six old tunnels in the western part of the site have also been gradually sorted out. The air compressors in each tunnel are being installed one by one. The 30-horsepower air compressor in Tunnel 17 has begun to be used, and a inclined tunnel in the "Nanshan" area has also begun to be renovated since May. All the staff and workers are making the most intense efforts to strive for a daily output of 500 tons of iron ore by the end of the year.
    In the past six months, the total amount of old ore selected and new ore mined at the Yantongshan Mining Site has reached more than 7,000 tons. The mining of new ore has increased from one or twenty tons in January to five or sixty tons in early May and to more than 240 tons in early June, reaching a maximum of 274 tons on June 15.
    In the reconstruction process over the past three months, the more than 140 old miners at the Yantongshan Mining Site have made significant achievements in training new workers. It is extremely difficult to have more than 140 old miners lead more than 1,000 new miners in mining inside the tunnels and transporting and selecting ore outside the tunnels. In the old society, it was impossible to get a master to tell his apprentices all the secrets of the job without reservation. In this regard, the administrative, trade union, and Party branch of the Mining Site used the spirit of "teaching new workers and developing production" to educate all the old miners, making most of the old miners change from impatience to patience, and making individual old miners change from unwillingness to teach to willingness to teach, relieving them of the burden of "the apprentice starves the master to death" ideologically and factually.
    In recent months, thanks to the patient education of the old miners to the new miners and the respect and willingness to learn of the new miners for the old miners, the new and old miners have become as close as family members. This atmosphere of unity, friendship, liveliness, and joy fills the entire space of Yantongshan.
    Engineers and workers have gradually become one. Old engineer Chang Xichun, who had worked in the Kailuan Coal Mine for more than ten years, has immersed his entire body and mind in the iron ore mining business here. He, together with military representatives and trade union指导 mining workers, has made and is making extremely important improvements in mining methods and safety equipment. The first is to correct the bad operation method of only making surfaces without tunneling during the Japanese occupation period. A method of tunneling on one side and mining the surface on the other side has been adopted. At the same time, efforts are made to ensure that the tunneling slope is uniform to facilitate the external transportation of ore; the tunnels are connected to facilitate ventilation; the top plates are inspected and supported with wooden pillars in a timely manner; and attention is paid to "finding and removing", that is, knocking down the ore that has not been blown down after blasting. Many improvements have also been made in ore transportation. The original downhill ore transportation road in the western Tunnel 17 was on the outside, and a large cliff was less than two feet away from the track. If one was not careful, the ore car would derail, and both the person and the car would be destroyed. Now the downhill road has been changed to the inner rail. In this way, even if the ore car derails, it will not fall off the cliff. In addition, the mine is adding vertical rails, stone piles, and railings to the ends of each chute to avoid the danger of the person and the car going down the chute due to the ore car being released too fast and out of control.
    In the past six months, thanks to the attention of the leaders of the Mining Site to safety equipment, no deaths have occurred in mining, ore transportation, and other operations. Workers injured in minor accidents have been treated by the mine. During the Japanese occupation period, due to poor safety equipment, there were several deaths of miners every day. At the foot of the mountains of the Yantongshan and Pangjiabao mining sites, one can still see patches of graves. Including the workers who were pressed in the pits, the total number is estimated to be more than 10,000.
    The Longyan Iron Mine has made significant achievements in employee welfare. The 53 workers' dormitories and cafeterias that began construction in Yantongshan in April have been completed one after another. The ruins that were mostly collapsed and dilapidated in the past have been renewed. The management personnel, cooks, and utensils of the four cafeterias in the area are all hired and installed by the mine. Other matters, such as the treatment of illnesses of all mine employees and their immediate family members, and the education of employees' children, are also the responsibility of the mine.
    Currently, the employees of various factories and mines of the Longyan Iron Mine are carrying out democratic movements and working hard to save raw materials, mass-produce various working machines, reduce costs, increase production, improve quality, and continue to improve safety equipment.

    龙烟铁矿的恢复与重建
    本报记者  李翼
    龙烟铁矿位于察哈尔省东南部之宣化、龙关、怀来等县境内，总储藏量为四亿二千余万吨，居华北首位。矿砂成层状，夹于震旦纪石英岩与矽质灰岩之间，矿层一层至三层不等，平均厚度自一点一四至三点四二公尺不等。含铁量一般均在百分之五十三以上，最高者竟达百分之六十一点三七。日寇侵据时期，年产曾高达七十二万余吨。
    负着建设中国工业的伟大历史使命，龙烟铁矿的一千六百个职工，在重获解放后半年多的时光里，用他们集体的智慧，用他们熟练而有力的双手，使龙烟铁矿在废墟上重建起来了。
    解放以前的龙烟，处在一种严重的瘫痪状态；现在的龙烟，则恢复了活力充沛的青春。
    龙烟铁矿的恢复工作最初所遭遇到的最大困难，要算是工具、工具机及采矿用压风机、矿车等的奇缺。国民党统治龙烟的两年间，对于矿山各项设备，极尽其掠夺之能事，采矿用各型动力机、压风机、绞车、矿车、铁轨及各种工具机，有的被拆散，有的被盗走。第一次解放期间工人所采之矿石，亦大部被他们运走，以其所炼钢、铁，用于屠杀人民。
    工人李慎臣、吴庆升描述解放时龙烟机器厂的情况说：“刚解放时，占有一百多亩地的机器厂，只有两部完整的旋床，一部电锯。使用的动力仅够七个半马力。整个一个翻砂房，只有一部半吨的烂铸铁炉，手头用的普通工具如板牙、弯尺、克丝钳等，都很少。”但是，这情景并没有使他们丧失了复工的信心，他们对饥饿、哭泣岁月的回忆，变成了他们在重获解放后积极恢复生产的“内燃机”。
    机器厂翻砂房的孟献同等十五位工友，在解放后不及一月的时间里，即将一所很大的翻砂房恢复了第一次解放时的模样。他们制作了足用的沙箱，修复了电碾，重配了铸铁炉的七点五马力的鼓风机和加料的小楼，筛出了被木屑、垃圾埋没了的沙子。自四月初至六月初，他们与其他工房的工友，已经为着采矿场装配了一百多辆矿车，六月份他们正为翻铸六百个矿车轮而努力。
    在打铁房和机器房，工友们与各项器材、原料的困难，作了无数次极坚韧的战斗。他们为了支持烟筒山矿场用小铁轨的修复工作，搜集了乱散在厂子里的各种废铁，制作了一万以上的道钉，节用五米长的五分铁棍二百余根。多年来被抛弃在地上无人理睬的车轴头、铁轨头，成了他们配制各种工具机的唯一原料。在以前，矿车用四方轴要用滚珠，现在由于滚珠的缺乏，他们改用了滚键。不久以前，工友们以放进耐火砖末的滚桶代替一无储存的砂布，磨光了从土堆里找出来的足够四百辆矿车用的滚键，较人工用砂布擂擦，要快三十倍。
    青年铁工吴庆升与同伴孙瑞、任双江等，在国民党匪帮统治时期，每日只能做二十个五分螺丝母；解放后由于他们积极的钻研，已增至二百二十个。铁工领班李慎臣直接掌握的一盘打铁炉，国民党匪帮统治时期，每日三人仅能打六个采铁用铁耙子，现已增至三十个。在六月上半月，他们除了完成正常的生产任务以外，另加作了三千个鱼尾螺丝。
    这种惊人的数量上的增加，是由于他们的政治情绪发生了根本的变化。吴庆升说：“在国民党匪帮统治时期，连饭都吃不饱，随时都会被捕，谁还有心去做活呢！那时大家通常迟到早退，就是不退，也是在工房里休息，或到工房外边去捡煤渣，一听经理的汽车来，就去赶快作两下，一听汽车走，照例是停工。”
    现在，机器厂的工友们，又恢复了一九四六年第一次解放期间积极工作的心情。没有工具，他们去用双手做；没有工具机，他们就用废铁配制。靠着全体职工的努力，在过去两个半月的时光里，机器厂本厂用工具机如旋床、刨床、元车等，已由刚解放时的两部，增配至十五部，使龙烟铁矿庞大的重建工程，有了最起码的条件。
    在宣化城东北十公里的烟筒山，是目前龙烟矿的主要采矿场。日寇侵据末期，即已停采，采矿设备大部他迁或被破坏。国民党匪帮统治时期，有矿工一百四十余人，专选旧存矿砂，未作任何采掘。此次解放后，华北人民政府公营企业部为使龙烟铁矿供给石景山钢铁厂以足够之矿砂，即着手大规模之重建工程。半年来，该地采矿工人，已由一百四十人增至一千二百余人，该地西部旧有之六个坑道内之铁轨、电灯等设备，亦次第整理就绪。各坑之压风机，正逐次安置，十七坑三十马力之压风机，已开始使用，该地“南山”一斜坑，自五月起亦已着手整顿。全体职工正为争取本年底日产五百吨铁砂而作最紧张的努力。
    半年来，烟筒山采矿所选旧矿砂及采新矿砂总数已达七千余吨。采掘新矿砂已由一月份之一、二十吨，五月初之五、六十吨，增至六月初之二百四十余吨，六月十五日最高达二百七十四吨。
    过去三个多月的重建过程中，烟筒山采矿场旧有的一百四十余位老矿工，在训练新工上有显著的成绩。以一百四十余位老矿工，去带动一千余新矿工，在坑内采掘，坑外运矿、选矿，是一件极不容易的事。旧社会里，要想让师父把作业的一切要诀毫无保留的告诉学徒，是不可能的事。采矿所的行政、工会和党的支部，在这方面以“教会新工，发展生产”的精神，教育了所有的老矿工，使大部分老矿工由不耐心变为耐心，使个别老矿工由不肯教变成了愿意教，从思想上和当前的事实上，解除了他们“教会了徒弟，饿死了师父”的包袱。
    几个月来，由于老矿工对新矿工的耐心教育，及新矿工们对于老矿工的尊敬和肯于学习，新老矿工之间，已亲如一家人。这种团结、友爱、活泼愉快的气氛，充满着烟筒山的全部空间。
    工程师和工人已逐渐打成一片。服务于开滦煤矿十几年的老工程师常锡纯，在这里已将全部身心浸入于铁矿的开采事业里。他协同军事代表和职工会指导采矿工友，在采矿方法和安全设备上，已经作了和正在作着极重要的改进。首先是改正了日寇统治时期不讲掘进，只作面的采掘的恶劣作业方法。作到了一面掘进，一面进行面的采掘的方法。同时力求掘进坡度均匀，便于矿砂外运；各坑间凿通，便于通风；检查顶板，适时顶以木柱；注意“找掉”，即将放炮后未被炸下来之矿石打下。在运矿上，亦作了不少的改进。西部十七坑下行运矿道原在外边，距轨道不及二尺即为大悬崖，一不小心，矿车出轨，人车会俱遭毁灭。现已将下行道改在里轨。这样，即使矿车出轨亦不致落下崖石。此外，矿方正于各个溜子的尽头，添筑竖轨、石堆及栏杆，尽量避免因矿车放的太快，操纵失灵，以致人车顺溜子而下的危险。
    半年来，由于采矿所领导上对于安全设备的注意，在采矿和运矿等作业上，还没有发生死亡事件。因小事故受伤的工人均已次第经矿方负责治疗。而在日寇统治时期，因安全设备较差，招致矿工死亡的事件，日必数起。烟筒山及庞家堡两采矿场的山脚下，至今还可以看到一片一片的坟头。连同被压在坑内的工友，据统计总数在一万名以上。
    在职工福利事业上，龙烟铁矿已有重大建树。四月份在烟筒山动工修筑的五十三所工人宿舍及食堂，已次第落成，昔日大部坍塌破落的废墟，今已焕然一新。该地四所食堂的管理人员、炊事员、用具，全由矿方雇用安设。其他如全矿职工本身及其直系亲属疾病之治疗，职工子女之教育等等，亦已由矿方负责。
    目前，龙烟铁矿各厂矿职工，正在开展民主运动中，为节约原料，大量配制各项工作机械，减低成本，增加生产，提高质量，继续改进安全设备而努力。
