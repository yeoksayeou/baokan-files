Xinhua News Agency, Beiping, June 24th: The latest issue of "New Era" magazine published an article discussing preparations for a peace treaty with Japan. The author writes that during the entire three and a half years of the occupation of Japan, the Soviet Union has consistently upheld the basic principles for a peace treaty with Japan as outlined in the Potsdam Conference. However, the US authorities have completely different plans for Japan. Under the pretext that Japan would be "defenseless" if US troops withdrew, Washington is striving to extend the occupation of Japan as much as possible, keeping it permanently in a state of occupation. In reality, the absence of a treaty is more suitable for American businessmen and the US Army than any treaty. The author cites the intensified activities of American entrepreneurs in Japan, for whom the occupation of Japan is a gold mine. Among these people, the most enthusiastic is the American businessmen's concern for Japan's war industry. The article states that the basic principle of the current US occupation policy is not to regard Japan as a defeated enemy that must be disarmed, but as a future ally and vassal, as the main industrial base for the planned aggressive Pacific bloc. The so-called "economic stabilization plan" aims to rebuild Japan's war machine. Instead of restoring Japan's peaceful industries, the US authorities are formulating plans to develop its war industries, much to the delight of Japanese industrialists. To illustrate this situation, the author exposes the US plans to restore Japan's steel, shipbuilding, aluminum, and other industries, pointing out that these plans are obviously not based on Japan's peacetime needs. From the US openly planning to restore Japan's war potential, it becomes clear why one of the main objectives of the occupation – forced reparations – has not been completed to this day. The author points out that the US economic plan will restore Japan's previous position in the Far East, making it the center of the Far East, while other Asian countries must become sources of raw materials and markets. With Japan's help, American monopoly capitalists not only intend to economically exploit this rich region, but also intend to prevent and suppress the democratic movements of Asian nations. The author concludes that Washington's policy of delaying the peace treaty with Japan month after month undermines the foundation of peace and security laid by the people's victory over Japanese imperialism.

    新时代论准备对日和约
    美帝延长占领日本  妄图用作侵略基地
    【新华社北平二十四日电】塔斯社莫斯科二十二日讯：最近一期“新时代”杂志刊载一篇准备对日和约的论文。作者写道：在占领日本的整整三年半时期中，苏联始终不渝地维护波茨坦会议就已拟定了的对日和约基本原则。美国当局对日本的打算，却完全不同。华盛顿借口如果美军撤退，日本将“毫无防御”，它正努力地尽可能延长对日本的占领，使其永远陷于被占领国的地位。实际上，没有条约的局面，比任何条约都更适合美国商人及美国陆军的口味。作者援引美国企业家加紧在日本活动的事实，对于那些人来说，占领日本就是金矿。在这些人中间，最狂热的就是美国商人对日本战争工业的关心。论文称，目前美国占领政策的基本原则，就是不把日本当作一个必须解除武装的战败敌国看待，而是把它当作未来的盟友与附庸，当作正在计划中的侵略性的太平洋集团的主要工业基地看待。所谓“经济稳定计划”，其目的即在于重建日本的战争机器。美国当局不去恢复日本的和平工业，却去制订发展其战争工业的计划，从而使日本工业家欢喜若狂。为了说明这种情形，作者揭露美国恢复日本钢铁、造船、制铝及其他工业的计划，指出这些计划自然并非基于日本平时的需要。从美国公开地计划恢复日本工业的战争潜力的行为看来，占领的主要目的之一——强制赔偿——为什么会到今天还没有完成，就变得清清楚楚的了。作者指出：美国经济计划将恢复日本以前在远东的地位，成为远东的中心，而其他亚洲各国，则必须成为原料的来源和市场。美国垄断资本家在日本的帮助之下，不仅打算在经济上剥削这片富饶的地区，而且还打算阻止及镇压亚洲各民族的民主运动。作者结语称：华盛顿月复一月地拖延对日和约的政策，损坏了人民战胜日本帝国主义所奠定的和平与安全的基础。
