Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, June 2nd: According to reliable sources, the Director of the Southeast Asia Division of the US State Department, Mr. Reed, and the British High Commissioner for Southeast Asia, Mr. MacDonald, held a joint conference in Delhi in mid-April with representatives from the US and British embassies in Southeast Asian countries. Both emphasized at the meeting the necessity of organized struggle to oppose the so-called "destructive forces in Asia." The joint conference is accelerating preparations for the signing of a Pacific Pact similar to the North Atlantic Aggression Treaty. Within this pact, India and Japan will bear special responsibilities. The same source states that the US and British representatives are negotiating the division of "responsibility areas" in Southeast Asia in order to more effectively support local reactionary forces and suppress the people's resistance. According to the opinions of the US and British representatives, Japan, South Korea, Vietnam, India, Malaya, Thailand, Taiwan, and Ceylon will be within the "responsibility area" of the United States, while India, Pakistan, Australia, New Zealand, and Burma will belong to the "responsibility area" of Great Britain.

　　美英外交代表联席会议妄图加速订“太平洋公约”
    【新华社北平二日电】据可靠方面消息，美国国务院东南亚洲司司长雷德和英国驻东南亚高级专员麦克唐纳曾于四月中旬在德里举行美英驻东南亚各国代表的联席会议。两氏在会上均强调必须以有组织的斗争来反对所谓“亚洲的破坏力量”。该联席会议加速准备签订类似北大西洋侵略公约的太平洋公约。在此公约内，印度与日本将负特殊的责任。同一消息称，美英两国代表正在谈判划分东南亚洲“责任范围”问题，以便更有效地扶植与支持当地的反动势力，镇压人民的反抗。依照美英代表的意见，日本、南朝鲜、越南、印度、马来亚、泰国、台湾和锡兰将在美国的“责任范围”内，印度、巴基斯坦、澳大利亚、新西兰和缅甸则将属于英国的“责任范围”。
