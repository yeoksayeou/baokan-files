Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 18th: Tokyo dispatch: Japanese Communist Party spokesman Yoshio Shiga issued a statement on the afternoon of the 16th, denouncing the lies spread by Hirokawa Kozen, secretary-general of the ruling party of Japan, the Democratic Liberal Party, on the evening of the 14th. Shiga said: The Japanese Communist Party will overthrow the fascist Yoshida government by uniting all the people in a concerted effort. Shiga emphasized: During the recent railway workers' strike and other workers' strikes, it was the Democratic Liberal Party, not the Communist Party, that relied on "violence." It is the Yoshida government of the Democratic Liberal Party that is using suppressive measures favorable to monopoly capital against Japanese laborers. Shiga denounced Hirokawa Kozen's rumors about the JCP instigating riots this autumn, pointing out that this was intended to create animosity towards the Communist Party.

　　日共发表声明
  　斥责吉田政府暴力镇压罢工
    将团结人民推翻法西斯内阁
    【新华社北平十八日电】东京消息：日本共产党发言人志贺义雄于十六日下午发表声明，痛斥日本执政党——民主自由党总书记广川弘禅于十四日晚散布的谎言。志贺说：日本共产党将以团结全国人民一致的方法，推翻法西斯吉田政府。志贺强调指出：在最近铁路工人罢工及其他工人罢工时，依靠“暴力”者是民主自由党，而非共产党。正是民主自由党的吉田政府对日本劳工使用有利于垄断资本的镇压措施。志贺斥责广川弘禅所散布的关于日共将于今秋煽动暴动的谣言，指出这是意图造成人们对共产党的恶感。
