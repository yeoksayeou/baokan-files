Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, 29th—The issue of tuition fees for private secondary schools in Tianjin has been largely resolved under the guidance and assistance of the People's Government, the Municipal Democratic Youth League, and the Student Union. After the liberation of Tianjin, some students in certain private schools refused to pay tuition. Lin Ziming, Deputy Director of the Municipal Education Bureau, issued a statement in February, pointing out that if students in private schools do not pay tuition, it will inevitably lead to financial difficulties for the schools, forcing them to close, which would affect the education of a large number of students. Therefore, for the sake of the students' own interests, they must pay tuition. However, the schools should still take care of individual students who are genuinely poor.

After this, the schools separately convened teachers, students, and parents to discuss and, based on the specific circumstances of each school, set standards for tuition and miscellaneous fees and specific payment methods (mostly adopting installment payments or deferred payments), and set aside a certain number of reduced-fee and free-tuition student places, generally accounting for 10% of all students. At the same time, in order to save expenses and reduce the burden on students, teachers and students of each school jointly formed financial audit committees or economic committees, responsible for reviewing and supervising the school's financial revenue and expenditure. The Youth League working group also promptly cooperated with publicity and education, mobilizing students to pay tuition fees through activists and key members among the students of each school taking the lead.

However, by early May, many schools still had very little tuition income, resulting in financial difficulties. To this end, Deputy Director Lin of the Municipal Education Bureau issued another statement, pointing out that students must pay fees in accordance with regulations to attend school. If they are able to pay but deliberately refuse to do so, the school can suspend their enrollment in accordance with school regulations. The school and the student union also cooperated with each other, persuading and mobilizing students to pay fees through teacher-student forums, parent meetings, individual talks, home visits, and review groups. After these educational explanations, most of the students who had not paid fees in various schools voluntarily paid their tuition fees. As of now, among the city's 41 private middle schools, more than 20 schools have achieved a payment rate of over 80%, and the payment rate of the remaining schools has also exceeded 70%. The issue of tuition fees has been basically resolved.

  　经过动员大部缴费
  　学校经费问题基本解决
    【新华社天津二十九日电】津市私立中等学校学费问题，在人民政府和市民主青年联合会、学生联合会的指导和协助下，基本上已经获得解决。津市解放后，若干私立学校某些学生即拒交学费。市教育局林子明副局长曾于二月间发表谈话，指出私立学校学生如不缴纳学费，必使学校经费困难以至被迫停办，影响广大学生失学，因此，为学生自己利益着想，必须缴纳学费。但对个别确属清寒者，校方仍应照顾。此后，各校即分别召集教职员、学生及学生家长，共同协商，根据各该校具体情况，订出学杂费的标准和缴费的具体办法（大多采取分期缴或缓缴），并设置了一定数目的减费生、免费生名额，一般占全体学生的百分之十。同时为了节省开支，减轻学生负担，各校教职员、学生并联合组成财政审计委员会或经济委员会，负责审查、监督学校经费收支情况。青联工作组也及时配合宣传教育，通过各校学生中的积极分子及骨干分子带头发动同学缴纳学费。但到五月初，仍有许多学校学费收入很少，致经费陷于困境。为此，市教育局林副局长再度发表谈话，指出学生上学必须照章缴费，如有力缴纳而故意不缴者，学校即可按照校章停止其学籍。校方与学生会亦互相配合，通过师生座谈会、家长恳谈会、个别谈话、家庭访问及审核小组等方式，说服动员学生缴费。各校大部分未缴费的学生经过这些教育解释，纷纷自动缴纳学费。截至目前，全市四十一个私立中学中，已有二十余校缴费人数达到百分之八十以上，其余各校缴费人数也都超过百分之七十，缴纳学费问题已基本上得到解决。
