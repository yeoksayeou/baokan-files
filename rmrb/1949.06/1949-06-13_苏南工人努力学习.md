Xinhua News Agency, Wuxi, 12th: Workers in cities in southern Jiangsu feel that obtaining the right to learn after liberation is a happiness they never had in the past. After the liberation of Wuxi, Zhenjiang, Suzhou and other places, workers asked the People's Liberation Army personnel for books to read, learned to sing, and invited People's Liberation Army personnel to give them reports. Workers in many factories in Changzhou pooled money to subscribe to newspapers and buy books, and set up reading rooms in the factories. Short-term training classes or literacy classes for workers have been established in Qishuyan in Changzhou, as well as Zhenjiang, Danyang and other places, to conduct studies in their spare time. Many workers at the Suzhou Sulun Yarn Factory proposed to learn from Zhu Guifang, the author of the "Yarn Factory Girl Worker Song" from Shijiazhuang. Some workers in Zhenjiang City used to mistakenly believe that they could enjoy more and work less after liberation, but now they have corrected this idea. The words of Shen Lao Si, a worker at the Yingchang Match Factory, best represent this change. He said: "We can only improve our lives by striving to develop production."

　　苏南工人努力学习
    【新华社无锡十二日电】江苏南部各城市的工人感到解放后得到了学习的权利是过去从来没有的幸福。无锡、镇江、苏州等地解放后，工人们纷纷向解放军人员要书看，学唱歌，并请解放军人员给他们作报告。常州许多工厂的工人凑钱订报买书，在工厂里成立起阅览室。常州的戚墅堰及镇江、丹阳等地，先后成立了职工短期训练班或识字班，利用业余时间进行学习。苏州苏纶纱厂的许多工人提出要向石家庄“纱厂女工歌”的作者朱桂芳学习。镇江市有些工人过去曾错误地认为解放后可以多享受少做工，但现在已纠正了这一想法。荧昌火柴厂的工人沈老四的话最能代表这种转变，他说：“我们只有努力发展生产，才能改善生活”。
