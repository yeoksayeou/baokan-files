　　Soviet Foreign Minister's Two Suggestions
　　With My Participation in the Preparation of the Peace Treaty with Japan Warmly Welcomed by the Chinese People
    At the recent Foreign Ministers' Conference, the issue of preparing the peace treaty with Japan, which is of great importance to the people of Asia, especially the Chinese people, was discussed due to a proposal by the Soviet Union. Soviet Foreign Minister Vyshinsky suggested twice that the current conference should agree on a time to convene a Foreign Ministers' Conference with Chinese participation to discuss the issue of the peace treaty with Japan. In stating this proposal, Vyshinsky cited the Potsdam Agreement, confirming that the Foreign Ministers' Conference is the only legitimate body responsible for preparing the peace treaty with Japan, and that the members of the Foreign Ministers' Conference should include China in the preparation of the peace treaty with Japan. Vyshinsky's suggestion was warmly welcomed by peace-loving people around the world, especially the Chinese people. Chinese democratic public opinion pointed out that a Foreign Ministers' Conference should be convened promptly to prepare the peace treaty with Japan, and that the soon-to-be-established Chinese Democratic United Government will send plenipotentiary representatives to participate and jointly formulate a peace treaty with Japan to eliminate Japanese militarism and realize the democratization of Japan. However, British and American representatives, especially U.S. Secretary of State Acheson, unreasonably rejected Vyshinsky's proposal. Acheson advocated that the Far Eastern Commission, rather than the Foreign Ministers' Conference, should prepare the peace treaty with Japan in order to manipulate everything. Acheson also attempted to delay the conclusion of the peace treaty with Japan and prolong the occupation of Japan. Acheson's behavior clearly harmed the interests of the Chinese people and exposed his sinister conspiracy to turn Japan into an accomplice for aggression in the Far East.

    Although the recent Foreign Ministers' Conference had significant shortcomings, it was still the first Foreign Ministers' Conference since the New York Foreign Ministers' Conference in December 1946 to reach some agreements. This will somewhat ease the international tension created single-handedly by U.S. imperialism, make it more difficult for international reactionaries to create pretexts for new wars, mark the resumption of normal activities of the Foreign Ministers' Conference, and thus enable the work of concluding treaties to continue. The agreements reached at the recent Foreign Ministers' Conference were a victory for the world's democratic camp in the struggle to defend peace. However, at this Foreign Ministers' Conference, on the most important issues, the United States, Britain, and France repeatedly rejected the Soviet Union's proactive proposals, resulting in a failure to reach agreement, exposing the imperialist bloc's continued implementation of a reactionary policy of dividing Germany, delaying peace treaties with Germany and Japan, and supporting the revival of reactionary forces in Germany and Japan, and continuing to adopt an adventurous policy of preparing for new wars. This must continue to arouse the serious vigilance of peace-loving people around the world.

    Recently, a series of news, comments, talks, statements, and statistics have continued to come from various sources, indicating that the specter of economic crisis is already standing at the doorstep of the United States. According to statistics from the U.S. Federal Reserve, the U.S. industrial production index has declined for seven consecutive months, from the post-war peak of 195 in October last year (1935-39 = 100) to 174 in May this year, a drop of more than 10 percent. The production of major light industries such as textiles, leather, and rubber has already begun to decline sharply since the fall of last year. Even the steel industry, which has always been stable in U.S. industry, has experienced a reduction in production. Figures cited by the American Iron and Steel Institute show that steel production has fallen for nine consecutive weeks, reaching only 86.7 percent of production capacity by the third week of June. Rudyick, the editor of the Wall Street Journal, said that industrial production next spring will be 30 to 40 percent lower than the post-war peak. The number of corporate bankruptcies averages about 200 per week.

    Due to the reduction in industrial production, U.S. stock prices have also fallen. Starting in late May, stock prices fell for five consecutive weeks. By mid-June, they had "fallen to their lowest point in four and a half years, causing Wall Street to tremble." (Associated Press) In terms of value, the total value of stocks registered on the securities market has fallen by $3 billion since the beginning of June.

    The number of unemployed people in the United States continues to increase dramatically. According to the Progressive Party, the number of unemployed people has now reached 5 million. If the current trend continues in the U.S. economy, it will reach 10 million this winter. This does not include a larger number of underemployed people. A report by the American Public Affairs Institute admits that there is currently no sign of a halt to unemployment.

    Further reductions in people's purchasing power have caused wholesale prices to fall by 5 percent in the year before May, while agricultural product prices have fallen by 15 percent. The Wall Street Journal said that farmers' corn prices this year will continue to fall by 30 percent, and wheat by 20 percent.

    Regarding this increasingly deteriorating situation in the U.S. economy, the American Progressive Party declared that "a fully mature crisis is descending on the United States," and pointed out that its danger is even greater than the crisis of 1929. The U.S. bourgeois groups, who are good at whitewashing, can no longer use ambiguous words to conceal the ruthless reality. Rudyick, the editor of the bourgeois Wall Street Journal, admitted that "in the minds of most entrepreneurs, the downward trend in the economy is already beyond doubt." Henry, a professor of economics at New York University, pointed out in the Hearst-owned newspaper "New York American Daily" that "even extreme optimists admit that there is currently a cyclical economic recession."

    The economic situation in Britain is also equally serious. British Conservative Party member Bracken has issued a warning: "The weather is about to become very dangerous."

    The current economic deterioration in Britain is characterized by a reduction in exports, a reduction in industrial production, and the depletion of industrial equipment. According to recent news, British exports in the second quarter of this year were 14 percent lower than in the fourth quarter of last year. The full-year dollar deficit is still 300 million pounds (more than 1.2 billion U.S. dollars).

    The further deterioration of the economic situation in the United States and Britain has made them equally eager to find a way out, which has made the struggle between the United States and Britain for world markets increasingly apparent. When the United States learned that Britain and Argentina had recently negotiated a trade agreement, it immediately opposed it and threatened to cancel "aid" to Britain. Currently, U.S. capital is even making inroads into Israel and India, attempting to exclude Britain and monopolize the markets of the two countries. At the same time, the United States and Britain have also launched fierce struggles over the issue of Middle Eastern oil. British Foreign Undersecretary Strang has been traveling to Iran and other places for this purpose, competing with the United States for oil exploitation. Regarding the contradictions between the United States and Britain under this cooperation between rider and horse, U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for Economic Affairs Thorp had to admit on the 23rd that "the honeymoon period in post-war international economic relations is now coming to an end, and hostilities and conflicts in world trade are beginning to appear again, and market competition is becoming more acute."

### 苏外长两次建议　有我参加准备对日和约获得中国人民热烈欢迎

　　苏外长两次建议
  　有我参加准备对日和约获得中国人民热烈欢迎
    在本届外长会议上，由于苏联的提议，曾经讨论了亚洲人民尤其是中国人民极其重视的准备对日和约问题。苏外长维辛斯基曾两次建议，本届会议应协议一个时期，召开有中国参加的外长会议，以讨论对日和约问题。在申述这一建议时，维辛斯基曾引据波茨坦协定，确证外长会议是负责准备对日和约的唯一合法机构，并且在准备对日和约时，外长会议的成员应包括中国在内。维辛斯基的这一建议受到世界爱好和平人民，尤其是中国人民的热烈欢迎。中国民主舆论指出，应该迅速召开外长会议准备对日和约，即将成立的中国民主联合政府将派全权代表参加，共同拟定肃清日本军国主义和实现日本民主化的对日和约。但英美代表首先是美国务卿艾奇逊却无理地拒绝了维辛斯基的建议。艾奇逊主张由远东委员会而不是由外长会议来准备对日和约，以便操纵一切。艾奇逊并企图拖延对日和约的缔结，延长对日本的占领。艾奇逊的这一行为，显然损害中国人民的权益，并暴露了她企图变日本为其远东侵略帮凶的罪恶阴谋。
    本届外长会议虽然有着重大的缺点，但它依然是一九四六年十二月纽约外长会议以后第一次获得若干协议的外长会议。这将使由美帝国主义一手制造的国际紧张空气得到某些缓和，将使国际反动派制造新战争的借口遭遇更大困难，将标志着外长会议恢复正常活动，从而使缔结和约工作的进行得以继续。本届外长会议所达成的若干协议，乃是世界民主阵营在保卫和平斗争中的一个胜利。但是，这次外长会议在最重要问题上，美英法一再拒绝苏联积极性的建议，以致未能得到协议，暴露了帝国主义集团继续执行分裂德国，拖延对德对日和约，并扶植德国与日本反动派复活的反动政策，继续采取准备新战争的冒险政策。这是必须继续引起全世界爱好和平人民的严重警惕的。
    最近，从各方面继续传来了一连串的消息、评论、谈话、声明和统计，指明经济危机的幽灵已经站在美国的门槛上了。据美国联邦准备局的统计，美国工业生产指数已经连续下降了七个月，即从去年十月的战后最高峰一九五（一九三五——三九年为一○○），一直跌落到今年五月的一七四，即跌了百分之十以上。主要的轻工业——纺织、皮革、橡皮等工业的生产，早从去年秋季即已开始急剧下降，就是在美国工业中一向稳定的钢铁业，也发生了生产的缩减。据美国钢铁研究所引用的数字，表明钢生产已连续下跌了九周，到六月第三周已仅开动生产力的百分之八十六点七了。华尔街的商务日报主编鲁迪克说，工业生产明年春天将较战后最高峰下降百分之三十到四十。企业的破产事件平均每周有二百起之多。
    由于工业生产的缩减，美国股票价格也随之下跌。从五月下旬开始，股票价格连续降落五星期，到六月中旬，曾“跌到了四年半以来的最低点，使华尔街为之战栗。”（美联社）如就价值来说，则证券市场登记的股票总值，六月初以来即已跌落三十亿美元。
    美国的失业人数在继续剧增。据进步党声称：现在失业人数已达五百万人，如果目前趋势在美国经济中发展下去，今冬将达一千万人。这还没有把更大数量的半失业者包括在内。美国公共事务研究所的报告承认：目前看不到失业有停止的趋势。
    人民购买力进一步降低使批发物价在五月以前的一年中下降了百分之五，农产品价格则已跌落百分之十五。华尔街日报称：今年农民的玉米售价将续跌百分之三十，小麦百分之二十。
    对于美国经济的这一日益恶化的情况，美国进步党宣布为“全面成熟的危机正降临美国。”并指出其危险程度较一九二九年的危机有过之而无不及。善于粉饰的美国资产阶级集团，对于无情的现实，也不能用含混的言词掩饰过去了。资产阶级的代表商务日报主编鲁迪克承认说：在一般企业家心目中，经济下降的趋势已经是无庸置疑的了。纽约大学经济学教授亨利在赫斯特系报纸“纽约美国人日报”上指出：“甚至极端乐观论者，也承认目前有着周期性经济衰退的事实。”
    英国经济的情况也同样严重。英国保守党员布拉肯已发出警号：“天气马上就要变得很险恶。”
    英国目前经济恶化的特点，是输出的减少，工业生产的缩减，和工业装备的耗损。据最近消息，英国今年第二季的出口比去年第四季少了百分之十四。全年美元赤字仍达三亿英镑（十二亿美元以上）。
    美英两国经济情势的进一步恶化，使得它们同样急迫地想向外找寻出路，这就使美英两国争夺世界市场的斗争，日益表面化。英国与阿根廷最近谈判好了一个贸易协定，事为美国所知，立刻遭到反对，并威胁要取消对英国的“援助”。目前美国资本更长驱直入以色列和印度，企图排斥英国而独霸该两国市场。同时，美英两国在争夺中东石油问题上也展开了激烈的斗争，英外次斯特朗曾为此而奔波于伊朗等地，即与美国竞争石油开采有并。关于美英两国这种骑马人和马的合作之下的矛盾，美国掌管经济事务的助理国务卿索甫，二十三日也不得不承认：“战后国际经济关系上的密月时期，现正接近结束，世界贸易上的敌对和冲突，又开始在出现，市场竞争正变得更加尖锐”。
