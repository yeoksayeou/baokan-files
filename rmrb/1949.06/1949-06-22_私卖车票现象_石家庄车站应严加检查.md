    Ticket Scalping Phenomenon
    Shijiazhuang Station Should Conduct Strict Inspections
    To the Editor:
    Last month, on the 15th, the family of Comrade Zhang Jinhong of the Taiyuan Medical Takeover Group came from Tianjin to Taiyuan to visit him. When they arrived in Shijiazhuang, they were extremely anxious because they couldn't buy tickets at the station. Someone introduced them to buy "flying tickets" (i.e., private tickets) from a small stall. Later, they indeed found a dumpling stall, and after much pleading, bought two tickets. Originally, the ticket price from Shijiazhuang to Yuci was 450 yuan per ticket, but they paid 2,500 yuan for these two tickets. The stall owner was still unhappy and insisted on 1,500 yuan per ticket. This kind of phenomenon is a corrupt practice of ticket sellers in the old society, and such phenomena should not be allowed after liberation.
    Furthermore, it is said that there are instances of people being beaten at Shijiazhuang Station. On the 18th, a villager didn't stand in line when buying a ticket and didn't follow the prescribed order, so the security personnel maintaining order at the station hit the villager. This kind of bad phenomenon is a bad habit left over from the Kuomintang and should be eradicated today. Villagers who don't follow station order should be given proper explanations and education, and those who haven't traveled before and don't understand station rules should be forgiven even more. Please pay attention to the above issues at Shijiazhuang Station. Li Tianwei
    To the Editor:
    It is rumored that some unscrupulous people in Shijiazhuang are secretly buying train tickets and selling them at high prices due to the recent crowding of passengers on the Zhengtai Railway. Local leaders should pay attention to inspection and handling. (Liang Xin)

### 私卖车票现象  石家庄车站应严加检查

    私卖车票现象
    石家庄车站应严加检查编辑同志：
    上月十五日，太原市医药接管组张金鸿同志的家属从天津来太原看他，走到石门因在车站上买不着票，急的了不得，有人介绍他们到小摊上去买飞票（即私票），后来他们果然找到一个卖饺子小摊，说了半天好话，买了两张。本来从石门到榆次每张票价是四百五十元，这两张给了人家两千五百元，该小摊尚不高兴，一定要一千五百元一张。此种现象，是过去旧社会卖票人营私捣鬼的勾当，解放后是不能允许这类现象的。
    又据谈，石门车站有打人的现象发生，十八日一个老乡买票没站到队里，没按规定次序去买，该车站维持秩序的警卫人员即用手打了这个老乡。这种恶劣的现象，是国民党遗留的坏作风，今天应该根除，对不遵守车站秩序的老乡，应好好的进行解释教育，对没出过门不懂得车站规矩的，更该原谅。以上问题请石门车站注意进行。  李天卫编辑同志：
    风闻石门市有些不肖之徒，由于最近正太路乘客拥挤，暗中购买车票高价售出，当地负责人应注意检查处理。          （良心）
