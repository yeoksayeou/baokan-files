Mr. Shen Zhiyuan, representative of the China National Salvation Association, said:
    The establishment of the Preparatory Committee for the New Political Consultative Conference is a great beginning for the Chinese people to create their own history and control their own destiny. People's representatives from various democratic classes, parties, beliefs, and nationalities are gathered together to prepare and decide on the basic principles for establishing the People's Republic of China. The more than one hundred people's representatives participating in the Preparatory Committee, although they have various differences, have a common great belief and goal, which is to completely relieve the suffering of the Chinese people who are trapped in a colonial and enslaved status and under the multiple oppressions of feudal, semi-feudal, and bureaucratic capitalism. At the same time, it is to build a new democratic China that is independent, free, democratic, peaceful, unified, prosperous, and strong. Everyone cherishes this belief and goal, bringing the hopes of the 470 million people of the country to the meeting. Therefore, the New Political Consultative Conference and the Old Political Consultative Conference have fundamental differences in principle. In the Old Political Consultative Conference, the anti-democratic, anti-people, traitorous, and reactionary factions occupied a considerable dominant position, while the New Political Consultative Conference fundamentally does not allow such reactionary factions to have the slightest trace of existence. The New Political Consultative Conference is a people's political consultative conference held by people from all democratic strata on the basis of the common principles of new democracy to build a new China and a new life that they have long hoped for. Therefore, this preparatory meeting of the New Political Consultative Conference is fundamentally different from the meetings fabricated in name by the Kuomintang reactionaries in the past (such as the pseudo-National Assembly, etc.). At the Preparatory Committee of the New Political Consultative Conference, on every issue, people can exchange opinions calmly, realistically, and enthusiastically, and achieve smooth passage. The meeting is full of the spirit of mutual respect and unity.

　　中国人民救国会代表沈志远先生说：
    此次新政协筹委会的成立，是中国人民创造自己历史，掌握自己命运的一个大开端。参加新政协筹委会的有各个不同民主阶级，不同党派，不同信仰，不同民族的人民代表聚集在一起，来筹备决定建立中华人民共和国的基本方针。参加筹委会的一百余人的人民代表，虽有种种不同，但是他们有共同伟大的信仰和目标，那就是要彻底解除陷于殖民地奴隶地位和封建半封建及官僚资本主义重重压迫下的中国人民的苦难。同时，要建设一个独立自由民主和平统一和富强的新民主主义的新中国。他们每个人都怀抱着这个信念和目标，把全国四万万七千万人民的希望带到会场中。因此，新政协和旧政协有它根本原则上的区别。旧政协时，反民主反人民卖国反动派们占着相当大的优势地位，而新政协则根本不允许这种反动派们有丝毫的萤迹存在。新政协就是各民主阶层人民在新民主主义共同的原则基础上，为建设他们自己所日望的新中国新生活而举行的一种人民的政治协商会议，所以在这次新政协的筹备会上，与过去国民党反动派所召开的伪造名义的会议（如伪国民大会等）有它根本的不同。新政协筹委会上，对每一问题，都能平心静气的，实事求是的热心交换意见，而获得顺利的通过。会上充满着互相尊重团结一致的精神。
