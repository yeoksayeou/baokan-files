　　Taiyuan Northwest Coal Mine No. 1
  　Reduced Working Hours, Increased Production
    [Taiyuan Electric Dispatch] After the liberation of Taiyuan, Northwest Coal Mine No. 1 shortened working hours, but production increased compared to before liberation. Before liberation, the factory had a twelve-hour working system, producing 700 tons of coal per day. After implementing a nine-hour working system on the 26th of last month, the daily output reached 737 tons. The reason for the increased productivity is that the oppression imposed on workers during the Yan Xishan bandit regime was lifted, and all the difficulties created for workers by Yan Xishan were resolved, which increased the workers' enthusiasm for production. According to the factory, during the period of Yan's puppet rule, workers had to carry six kinds of "slave certificates" when leaving the mine, including a national ID card, conscription deferment certificate, combat certificate, worker's certificate, and pass. If any one was missing, they would be drafted into the army or arrested on the charge of "disguise." After liberation, our takeover team immediately abolished all slave restraints and destroyed all kinds of certificates. All matters related to the vital interests of workers, such as wages, food, and medical expenses, have been reasonably adjusted. The factory's production self-salvation mobilization committee has also organized workers' families to reclaim wasteland or engage in business for production. In order to improve the awareness of employees, training classes are also held in rotation. The workers who have been trained have all made production plans, ensuring active production, setting an example, and motivating everyone.

　　太原西北煤矿一厂
  　工时缩短产量增高
    【太原电】太原市西北煤矿一厂解放后，缩短工时，生产量反比解放前增加。该厂解放前为十二小时工作制，每天产煤七百吨；上月二十六日开始施行九小时工作制后，日产量达七百卅七吨。生产力提高的原因，是解除了阎匪统治时期所加于工人的压迫，解决了阎匪给工人造下的一切困难，使工人生产情绪提高。按该厂在阎伪统治时期，工人出矿时得携带国民身份证，缓役证、战斗证、工人证、通行证等六种奴隶证，缺一即被抓丁，或以“伪装”逮捕。解放后我接管组立即将一切奴隶束缚全部废除，并将各种证件销毁。凡有关工人切身利益之工资粮及医药费，均予合理调整。该厂生产自救动员会更组织工人家属开荒地或营商，以谋生产。为提高职工觉悟，又开办轮训班，受了训的工人都订了生产计划，保证积极生产，以身作则，带动大家。
