　　[Jinan Electric] The Mian River in Handan City overflowed and caused disaster last summer after heavy rains. In order to prevent flooding this summer and autumn, the Municipal Government has allocated 30,000 jin of rice to repair the river embankment. Currently, residents and villagers from various streets are being mobilized to start construction. It is stipulated that each worker will receive four jin of rice per day. If the work is active and the results are significant, it can be increased to five to six jin. A preliminary work estimate has been carried out by the Municipal Government's Construction Section. Construction will begin immediately on sections of the river embankment where there is no wheat. On riverbanks with wheat, workers will be paid in advance with the rice wages and construction will begin after the wheat harvest. Currently, villages such as Ximenli, Dongmenwai, and Liujiaochang have successively started construction. Other streets and villages, such as Douzhuang and Nanmenli, are also preparing to start construction. This contract system will allow the river embankment to be repaired quickly, and at the same time, help the masses solve some of their immediate food shortages during this difficult period between harvests.

　　邯市拨粮三万斤修堤防汛
    【冀南电】邯郸市境内的沔河，去夏大雨后，水滥成灾。市府为防止今夏、秋泛，特拨米三万斤修理河堤，现正动员各街、村民工动工，规定每工小米四斤，如工作积极成绩大，可增至五斤至六斤。日前已由市府建设科分段估工，河堤两岸，没有麦子的地方，马上即行动工；有麦子的河岸，分工后即让群众先领工资米，麦收后即动工。现西门里、东门外、刘家场等村已先后动工，其余如豆庄、南门里等街村，亦正准备动工。这样包工制，河堤很快即可修复，同时在青黄不接的困难时期，也帮助群众解决眼前的一部分吃粮困难。
