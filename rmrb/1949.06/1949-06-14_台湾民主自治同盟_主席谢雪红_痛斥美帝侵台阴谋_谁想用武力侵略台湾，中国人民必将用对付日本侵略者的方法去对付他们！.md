Xinhua News Agency, Peiping, 13th. Chairman of the "Taiwan Democratic Self-Government League," Xie Xuehong, recently issued a statement regarding the US imperialists' active plot to annex Taiwan, saying: "The American reactionaries, seeing that the Kuomintang reactionary regime on the mainland is about to be completely overthrown, are trying to seize China's sacred territory, Taiwan Province, as a base for future aggression against the Chinese mainland. Since the surrender of Japan, in addition to obtaining military and economic privileges of aggression in Taiwan through the hands of the Kuomintang traitorous government, American imperialism has also constantly instigated several Taiwanese national scum to shout for Taiwan's 'independence,'妄想to turn Taiwan into its colony. Recently, US imperialism has colluded with British imperialism to plot the establishment of a so-called Asian 'anti-communist barrier line' with Taiwan as a key stronghold. The hideous face of the American imperialists' aggression against Taiwan is even more exposed. However, this conspiracy of the American aggressors will surely be crushed by the Chinese people, just as the Japanese aggressors' so-called 'Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere' was crushed." Xie Xuehong denounced the lie that the status of Taiwan has not yet been determined. She said: "Throughout history, Taiwan has been a part of Chinese territory, and the people of Taiwan are also a part of the Chinese nation. Recovering Taiwan was one of the important goals of the Chinese people's many years of struggle against Japanese imperialism. The Chinese people have the right to recover their occupied territory, and it is only natural for Taiwan to return to the motherland, and the Cairo Declaration and the Potsdam Declaration both have clear provisions. The so-called undetermined status of Taiwan before the signing of a peace treaty with Japan is just a despicable lie of the aggressors. We want to warn the imperialist elements who妄想to annex Taiwan: Whoever wants to invade Taiwan by force and enslave the Taiwanese people, the Chinese people will use the methods they used to deal with the Japanese invaders to deal with them." Xie Xuehong said: "The wishes of the Taiwanese people are completely contrary to the cries of those national scum bought by the United States. The purpose of the Taiwanese people's successive bloody struggles over the past fifty years has been to get rid of the enslavement of the Japanese bandits and return to the embrace of the motherland. The current revolutionary goal of the Taiwanese people is to overthrow the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang, the running dog of US imperialism, abolish all aggressive privileges of US imperialism in Taiwan, and realize the local democratic autonomy of the Taiwanese people in the big family of the unified Chinese People's Democratic Republic, and build a new democratic Taiwan. The Taiwanese people will fully assist the Chinese People's Liberation Army in liberating Taiwan. Since the Chinese mainland is about to be completely liberated, the day of Taiwan's liberation is not far away."

  　痛斥美帝侵台阴谋         
    谁想用武力侵略台湾，中国人民必将用对付日本侵略者的方法去对付他们！
    【新华社北平十三日电】“台湾民主自治同盟”主席谢雪红顷就美国帝国主义积极进行吞并台湾的阴谋活动发表谈话称：“美国反动派因为看见在大陆上的国民党反动政权即将全部被推翻，正力图攫取中国的神圣领土台湾省，作为将来侵略中国大陆的基地。自日本投降以后，美国帝国主义除了经过国民党卖国政府之手取得在台湾的军事的和经济的侵略特权以外，并曾不断地嗾使几个台湾籍的民族败类发出台湾‘独立’的叫喊，妄想把台湾变成它的殖民地。最近美帝国主义又勾结英帝国主义，策动建立一条以台湾为关键据点的所谓亚洲‘反共隔断线’。美国帝国主义者侵略台湾的狰狞面目是更加暴露无遗了。但是，美国侵略者的这个阴谋一定将被中国人民所粉碎，正象日本侵略者的所谓‘大东亚共荣圈’曾被粉碎一样。”谢雪红痛斥所谓台湾地位尚未确定的谎言。她说：“有史以来，台湾就是中国领土的一部分，台湾人民也是中华民族的一部分。收复台湾，曾是中国人民多年来反对日本帝国主义的斗争的重要目的之一。中国人民有权收回被侵占的领土，台湾回归祖国版图是理所当然的，而且开罗宣言、波茨坦宣言均有明文规定。所谓在对日和约未签订前台湾的地位尚未确定，不过是侵略者卑鄙的谎言而已。我们要警告妄想吞并台湾的帝国主义分子：谁要想用武力来侵占台湾，来奴役台湾人民，中国人民必将用对付日本侵略者的方法去对付他们。”谢雪红说：“台湾人民的愿望和美国所收买的那些民族败类的叫嚣完全相反。台湾人民五十年来前仆后继的流血斗争其目的就是摆脱日寇的奴役，重回祖国的怀抱。台湾人民目前的革命目标是推翻美帝走狗国民党的反动统治，废除美帝国主义在台湾的一切侵略特权，在统一的中华人民民主共和国的大家庭中实现台湾人民的地方民主自治，建设新民主主义的新台湾。台湾人民将全力协助中国人民解放军解放台湾。由于中国大陆即将全部解放，台湾解放的日子已经不远了。”
