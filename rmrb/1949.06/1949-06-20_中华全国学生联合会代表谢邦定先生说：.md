Mr. Xie Bangding, representative of the All-China Students' Federation, said:
    The convening of the new Political Consultative Conference is an epoch-making event in the history of China and even the world, and it is an exciting event!
    In the past, we students were subjected to enslaving education, and we suffered cruel persecution by the Kuomintang reactionaries in politics. We had no freedom of thought or freedom of speech. Our student union was declared "illegal," and we were treated as "bandits." Under the surveillance of military police, secret agents, clubs, machine guns, prisons, hunger, and death threatened us at any time and anywhere. But today, we have all become members of the preparatory committee for the new Political Consultative Conference and directly participate in the management of the country. We Chinese students and the Chinese people have truly become masters of the country for the first time. This is the goal of the arduous struggle of Chinese students and the people of the whole country for many years. After the Chinese Communist Party called for the rapid convening of the new Political Consultative Conference on May 1st last year, our students responded to this call with unparalleled enthusiasm, and worked with the people of the whole country to strive for the early realization of this call. Today, a year later, it has finally been realized. This joy, this happiness, cannot be described by any words.
    The convening of the new Political Consultative Conference is a victory for the people of the whole country and also a victory for the students of the whole country, turning us from slaves into masters. History clearly tells us that only when the people of the whole country unite under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, overthrowing the rule of imperialism, feudalism, bureaucratic capitalism, and the Kuomintang reactionaries, will China have a future, and we students will also have a future. We students across the country must wholeheartedly support this new Political Consultative Conference, which includes all democratic parties, people's organizations, democratic人士 from all walks of life, representatives of domestic ethnic minorities, and overseas Chinese under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party. Under the leadership of the democratic coalition government elected by it, we will strengthen the study of the theory of the New Democratic Revolution, study scientific and cultural knowledge, participate in various revolutionary works and construction undertakings, and strive to quickly eliminate all reactionary remnants and build an independent, free, democratic, prosperous, and unified People's Republic of China.

　　中华全国学生联合会代表谢邦定先生说：
    新的政治协商会议的召开，是全中国乃至全世界历史上划时代的一件大事，是一件令人兴奋的大事！
    在过去，我们学生受的是奴化教育，政治上更遭受国民党反动派的残酷迫害，我们没有思想的自由、言论的自由；我们的学联被宣布为非“法”，我们被当作“匪徒”。处在军警宪特的监视之下，棍棒、机枪、监牢、饥俄、死亡随时随地威胁着我们。但在今天我们都成了新政协筹备会的一员，直接参加了国家的管理，我们中国学生、中国人民第一次真正做了国家的主人，这是我们中国学生也是全国人民多少年来艰苦斗争的目标。在去年五一中国共产党号召迅速召开新政协以后，我们学生曾以无比的热情来响应这个号召，与全国人民一道以行动来争取这个号召的早日实现，一年后的今天，终于得以实现，这高兴，这愉快，实在不是任何字眼所可以形容的。
    新政协的召开，是全国人民的胜利，也是全国学生的胜利，使我们从奴隶变成了主人。历史清楚的告诉我们，只有全国人民团结在中国共产党与毛主席的领导之下，打倒帝国主义、封建主义、官僚资本主义和国民党反动派的统治，中国才有前途，我们学生也才有前途。我们全国学生一定竭诚拥护这个在中国共产党领导下包括各民主党派、各人民团体、各界民主人士、国内少数民族和海外华侨代表人物的新政协，并在它所选出的民主联合政府的领导下，加强学习新民主主义革命理论，学习科学与文化知识，参加各种革命工作与建设事业，为迅速肃清一切反动残余，建设起一个独立、自由、民主、富强、统一的中华人民民主共和国而奋斗。
