　　Beiping City News: The second phase of industrial registration work in this city has begun. Yesterday (9th) at 9:00 AM, the Industry and Commerce Bureau convened a meeting with over 1,600 representatives from fifteen sectors, including printing, leather making, machine flour, rubber, matches, papermaking, soap making, dyeing, carpet making, kiln industry, cigarettes, sesame oil, soy sauce, foreign wine brewing, and soda water. Cheng Hongyi, Director of the Industry and Commerce Bureau, briefly explained the significance of the registration work: the government aims to gain a comprehensive understanding of the city's production status and supply and demand situation through this registration, to guide production and help private factories solve various difficulties and losses caused by the blindness of production. Registration is to protect and support production undertakings. For manufacturers who refuse to register, the government cannot recognize them as legitimate operations, and naturally, they cannot enjoy legitimate rights. The scope of registration includes all industries and handicrafts, whether factories, workshops, or home handicrafts. Chen, Deputy Section Chief of the Industry and Commerce Bureau, explained the registration methods: The first step is to organize industrial households into temporary groups by district and street, each group having a temporary group leader designated by the government. The second step is to distribute registration forms, which will be uniformly distributed by the trade association to the temporary groups, and then to each household. Those who cannot fill out the form can seek assistance from the group leader or the directors and supervisors of the trade association. Once completed, the form should be submitted to the group leader; if no group is organized, it should be submitted directly to the chairman of the industry. The meeting adjourned at 10:40 AM.

　　平市二期工业登记开始
    工商局昨召开十五行业会议  说明登记是为正确指导生产
    【平市讯】本市工商局第二期工业登记工作已开始进行。昨（九）日上午九时，工商局召集印刷、制革、机器面粉、橡胶、火柴、造纸、造胰、染业、毯业、窑业、卷烟、芝麻油、酱油、洋酒酿造、汽水业等十五个行业代表一千六百余人开会，工商局程宏毅局长扼要说明：登记工作的意义，是政府要通过这次登记，对本市的生产状况和供求情况有一全面了解，指导生产，帮助私营工厂解决因生产的盲目性所造成的各种困难和损失。登记就是为了保护和扶植生产事业。对于不肯登记的厂家，政府不能认为是合法的经营，自然也就不能享受合法的权利。登记的范围，凡属工业、手工业，不论是工厂、作坊或家庭手工业都须进行登记。工商局陈副科长则就登记方法加以说明：第一步按区、街把工业户组织为若干临时小组，每个小组有政府指定的临时组长。第二步散发登记表，由公会统一发到临时小组，再发到各户。不会填的可找小组长或公会理监事帮助填写。填毕交给小组长，没有组织小组的，直接交给该业的会长。大会到十时四十分散会。
