　　Supplying Rural Areas with City Manure for Fertilization
　　Ping City Supply and Marketing Cooperative Organizes Manure Sales
　　[Our Newspaper] The Beiping Supply and Marketing Cooperative has recently organized the supply and sale of manure to solve the serious fertilizer shortage in the suburbs of Ping City and nearby counties during the green manuring season, and to find a solution for the accumulated manure in Ping City. The land reform in the suburbs of Ping City and nearby counties has not been fully implemented. Landlords and rich peasants are taking a wait-and-see attitude and no longer buying manure for fertilization. Poor and hired peasants want to buy it but lack the means. Some manure merchants in the suburbs of Beiping are also holding a wait-and-see attitude and dare not lend out manure, fearing that they will not be able to recover the payment in the future. As a result, there is a contradiction: rural areas lack fertilizer, and Beiping has accumulated five to six hundred thousand baskets of dried manure with no way to sell it. Under the principle of increasing production and exchanging goods between urban and rural areas, the Beiping Supply and Marketing Cooperative decided to organize the supply and sale of manure. The cooperative borrowed money from the Cooperative Bank and then, with a method of half credit and half cash payment, purchased a large amount of dried manure from manure merchants, and through local governments and cooperative organizations, lent it interest-free to poor and hired peasants and middle peasants in the suburbs and nearby counties. The manure price will be repaid in kind (corn) before the first day of the tenth lunar month. Currently, the Supply and Marketing Cooperative has purchased 80,200 baskets of dried manure outside Fuchengmen, which will be distributed to farmers in the Nanyuan area; and 45,600 baskets outside Guang'anmen, which will be distributed to farmers near Huangcun. Purchases will continue in the future. Production promotion agencies in Dingxing and Xincheng counties have also contacted us, requesting manure loans.
　　The more than 125,000 baskets of dried manure already purchased by the Ping City Supply and Marketing Cooperative average sixteen catties per basket, totaling more than two million catties. Assuming 150 catties of fertilizer are applied per mu of dry land, it can fertilize about 14,000 mu, and with an increase of more than two dou per mu, it can increase production by 30,000 dou. For paddy fields, 700 catties of manure are required per mu, which can supply 3,000 mu. With an increase of one shi per mu, a total of 3,000 shi can be increased. The quality of grain can also be improved. In the future, the accumulated dried manure in Beiping may be gradually lent out, which will have a greater benefit to increased production.

　　以城市粪便供农村肥田
  　平市供销总社举办粪肥供销
    【本报讯】北平供销合作总社顷举办粪肥供销，以解决平市郊区和附近各县抓青时期缺乏肥料的严重困难，同时给平市积存的粪肥找了出路。平郊区和附近县份农村尚未完全实行土地改革，地主富农意存观望，不再购买大粪施肥，贪雇农想买没有力量；北平城郊若干粪商也抱着观望态度，不敢将粪肥贷出，恐将来收不回价款。结果造成农村缺肥，北平积存了五、六十万筐粪干无处推销的矛盾现象。北平供销合作总社在增加生产、交流城乡物资的原则下，决定举办粪便供销，由合作总社向合作银行借款，然后以一半信用赊借，一半现款拨付的方式，向粪商购借大批粪干，通过当地政权和合作社组织，无利贷给郊区及附近各县的贫雇农和中农，于旧历十月一日前按实物（玉米）偿还粪价。现供销总社已在阜城门外买到粪干八万零二百筐，将分配给南苑一带农民；又在广安门外买到四万五千六百筐，将分配给黄村附近农民，今后仍将继续购借。定兴、新城等县的生产推进社也来联络，要求贷粪。
    现平市供销总社已购到的十二万五千余筐粪干，平均一筐十六斤，共约二百余万斤，以旱地一亩施肥一百五十斤计，约可肥田一万四千亩，以每亩增产二斗多计，可增产三万斗。水田一亩需施七百斤粪，计可供给三千亩。一亩以增产一石计，共可增产三千石。粮食品质也可提高。今后北平积存的粪干可能陆续贷出，对增产当有更大好处。
