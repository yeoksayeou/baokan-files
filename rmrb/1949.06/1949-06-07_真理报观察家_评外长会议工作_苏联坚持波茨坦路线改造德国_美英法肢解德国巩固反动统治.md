Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, June 6th: TASS, Moscow, June 4th: Pravda observer Malinin, commenting on the work of the Foreign Ministers' Conference, stated: From the very beginning of the Paris Foreign Ministers' Conference, the Soviet delegation put forward a constructive program for a practical solution to the problem of German unification.

　　This program, as a whole or in terms of the specific measures it proposed, proceeded from the fundamental essence of the historic decisions of the Potsdam Conference. This line inextricably linked the success of the entire task of transforming Germany into a peaceful and democratic country with the effective cooperation of the four powers on the German question.

　　In the course of the discussions at the Paris Foreign Ministers' Conference, what did the representatives of the United States, Britain, and France put forward to oppose this clear program? For almost an entire week, they avoided directly stating their views on the German question, limiting themselves to "criticizing" the Soviet proposals. It was not until later that Bevin put forward a proposal that immediately gained the full support of Acheson and Schuman.

　　Although the representatives of the Western countries did not lack formal and verbal courtesies toward the Potsdam decisions in their speeches, their proposals were straightforwardly aimed at finally completing the dismemberment of Germany, that is to say, an unadulterated anti-Potsdam line.

　　Ultimately, the Western countries' proposals were nothing more than to have the Foreign Ministers' Conference approve the establishment of a West German state and the divisive activities that had shattered four-power cooperation. This may seem absolutely unbelievable at first glance, but it is precisely the true essence of the proposals of the three Western ministers.

　　Despite how absurd it may be, the proposal put forward by Bevin on behalf of the three Western ministers, in effect, not only stipulated that the Foreign Ministers' Conference should approve the divisive measures already taken by the Western countries, but even go further to extend these measures to East Germany, imposing the notorious "Occupation Statute" and the anti-people "Bonn Constitution" on East Germany.

　　Now, it is clear to everyone why the ministers of the three Western countries so stubbornly rejected the Soviet proposal to restore the activities of the Control Council; why the establishment of an all-German State Council was completely unwelcome to them; and why they described returning to the Potsdam Agreement as a "regression," while completing the dismemberment of Germany was "progress."

　　The program put forward by Acheson, Bevin, and Schuman was by no means aimed at resolving the German question, but at consolidating the position of the United States, Britain, and France in Germany. Under this "plan," there was naturally no question of German unification or of the German people participating in the resolution of matters concerning the future destiny of their country. The ruling groups of the United States, Britain, and France proposed that their current policies should also be applied in the future. Apart from the determination to depart from the program and principles of Potsdam, they did not think about the future of Germany.

　　It is because of this that the Soviet government rejected the proposals of the United States, Britain, and France.

　　Now, it is difficult to find fools who would seriously take the view that the differences over the issue of German unification are merely differences over the methods of implementing unification. In fact, the three Western countries abandoned the decisions of the Potsdam Conference, thus laying the cornerstone for the dismemberment of Germany and the establishment of a West German state under the aegis of the United States and Britain. Even the most skillful sophistry cannot obscure this fact.

    苏联坚持波茨坦路线改造德国　美英法肢解德国巩固反动统治
    【新华社北平六日电】塔斯社莫斯科四日讯：真理报观察家马里宁评外长会议的工作称：从巴黎外长会议工作一开始，苏联代表团就提出了切实解决德国统一问题的建设性纲领。
    这个纲领整个地说或者就它所提出的各项措施分别地说，都是从构成波茨坦会议的历史性决定的根本要旨的政治路线出发的。这条路线，把改造德国为和平民主国家之整个任务的成功与四强在德国问题上的有效合作不可分地联结在一起。
    在巴黎外长会议的讨论过程中，美英法代表提出了什么来反对这个明确的纲领呢？几乎整整一周中，他们都避免直接说出他们对德国问题的意见，而仅限于“批评”苏联的建议。直至后来贝文才提出了一个建议，这个建议立即获得艾奇逊和舒曼的完全支持。
    虽然西方国家的代表们，在演说中并不缺少形式上言词上的对波茨坦决定的殷勤，但是，他们的建议，却是率直地最后完成肢解德国的路线，即是说，不折不扣的反波茨坦路线。
    归根到底，西方国家的建议，不过是要外长会议批准他们在德国建立西德国家和使四国合作破裂的分裂活动而已。这点骤然看来也许是绝对不能置信的，但却恰恰是西方三部长的建议的真正要旨。
    尽管这是如何地荒唐，贝文代表西方三部长提出的建议，在实际上不仅规定外长会议应批准西方国家所已采取的分裂措施，甚至还要更进一步把这些措施扩大到东德，把臭名远扬的“占领法规”和反人民的“波恩宪法”强加于东德。
    现在，每一个人都清楚：为什么三个西方国家的部长这样顽固地拒绝苏联关于恢复管制委员会活动的建议；为什么建立全德国务会议完全不为他们所喜；为什么他们把回到波茨坦协定说成“倒退”，而完成德国的肢解却是“前进”。
    艾奇逊、贝文、舒曼所提的纲领，其目标决不是解决德国问题，而是巩固美英法在德国的地位，在这种“计划”之下，自然是谈不到什么德国的统一或使德国人民参加解决有关其国家之未来命运的。美英法统治集团提议把他们现行的政策也用诸于将来。除了决意离开波茨坦的纲领和原则以外，他们并不想到德国的明天。
    就是因为这样，苏联政府拒绝了美英法的建议。
    现在，已经很难找到这样的傻瓜，会认真地看待那种说德国统一问题上的分歧仅仅是实行统一的方法上的分歧的说法。事实，三个西方国家背弃波茨坦会议的决定，因而给肢解德国和建立美英卵翼下的西德国家奠立了基石。即使最巧妙的诡辩，也不能蒙混这个事实了。
