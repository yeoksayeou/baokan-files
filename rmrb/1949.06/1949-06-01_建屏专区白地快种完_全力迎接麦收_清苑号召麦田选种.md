[Chahar News] The Jianping Special District has arranged current production work, calling for organized efforts to welcome the wheat harvest. On May 24th, Comrade Liang Yuqing, secretary of the District Committee, made a comprehensive summary and inspection of the production work since spring at the joint meeting of county secretaries, county heads, and Qingfu Committee members. He explained that the current rush planting of white land is largely completed, and the wheat harvest is approaching. We should seize the season and prepare to welcome the wheat harvest: 1. First, we must deeply recognize the current lack of labor and animal power, and we must widely utilize the role of various types of mutual aid teams. In organizing, we should pay attention to preventing coercion and laissez-faire phenomena. With the branch as the core, we should mobilize the forces of youth and women's systems to launch a wheat harvest assault movement, and mobilize mountainous areas with less wheat planting and areas affected by hail (parts of Lingshou and Pingshan villages) to sell labor in the plains areas with more wheat planting. We must organize short-term labor in a focused manner, and the wages should be freely agreed upon by both parties. 2. Further deepen the inspection of substitute cultivation and completely solve the problems to ensure that the wheat of revolutionary martyrs, military personnel, and workers' families is harvested in a timely manner. 3. During the wheat harvest, we should be vigilant, pay attention to preventing bad elements from taking the opportunity to incite looting and theft, oppose complacency, and strengthen wheat protection work. 4. Educate the masses to break the old habit of not selecting wheat seeds. Party members should take the lead as models, mobilize women, and carry out field seed selection. 5. Harvest and thresh as soon as it ripens to prevent accidental intrusion of natural disasters such as rain, wind, and hail. 6. Combine the wheat harvest and use wheat bran and wheat straw to press fertilizer into the land to prepare for sowing late seedlings. 7. Strengthen medical work, eliminate diseases in a timely manner, achieve a strong population and livestock, and go all out to complete the wheat harvest in a concentrated effort. 8. In the wheat harvest, the cooperative should collect a portion of loan grain to prepare for future loans and loans to newly disaster-stricken areas. We must correct the lazy ideas of cadres who are afraid of trouble. The above tasks should be immediately publicized to the masses, and specific forces should be organized to carry out a concentrated assault. (Jianping Branch Yongbin, Zhao Chun)
    [Jizhong News] The Baonan Qingyuan area is experiencing a serious wheat black ear disease disaster. The poor harvest of wheat fields is causing great anxiety among the masses. According to Wang Luokang of Xin'anpu, Sixth District, the cause of the disaster is that last year's wheat seeds had black ear disease spikes. During last year's wheat harvest season, his family's threshing ground was blackened due to black ear spikes. When planting, he was afraid that the seeds would not sprout, so he borrowed four dou from relatives and bought three dou at the market, planting nine mu. He used his own wheat seeds to plant three mu. This year, the same amount of fertilizer was applied when watering and hoeing together. As a result, there were very few black ear spikes in the nine mu, and the black disease spikes in his own three mu were severely affected, reaching more than 80 percent. In addition, black ear spikes are not easy to distinguish from good wheat spikes, and most people only discover them during threshing. If the seeds are not soaked and selected when planting, the disease spreads more and more. From May 16th to 20th this year, the weather was hot and foggy for five days, and there was a lack of wind, which was just when the wheat was flowering and filling, making it easy for black ear disease bacteria to grow and spread, resulting in a serious disaster. Based on the above investigation, the county party committee issued a call to mobilize and organize the masses to carry out field seed selection during this year's wheat ripening season, selecting wheat seeds with strong resistance to disease. After autumn, soaking and planting should be carried out. In areas with severe disease, good wheat seeds should also be exchanged during autumn planting to avoid disease inheritance. It also instructs that during the current sowing of large autumn crops, the masses should be organized and led to carry out seed soaking and selection, introduce good varieties, and take early precautions to reduce diseases. (Huo Guobin, Ma Zhiyi, Duan Mingqin, Chenguang)
    [Another News] The black ear disease of wheat fields in the Eleventh District of Qingyuan is serious. When sowing large autumn crops, the district committee has followed the instructions of the county committee and educated the masses with examples of wheat field damage, vigorously promoting seed selection and soaking to prevent disasters. District Chief Yuan of the district personally led the work in Siliying Village. After carrying out seed soaking and selection propaganda, some of the masses accepted it, but they all reflected that they did not know how to soak and were afraid of scalding the seeds, which would prevent them from sprouting. In addition to introducing the seed soaking method, District Chief Yuan personally taught the village cadre Han ××'s family how to soak seeds, and called seven villagers to watch. After planting, the seeds sprouted completely in five days, one day earlier than those that were not soaked, and the seedlings were very neat. This dispelled the masses' concerns. After everyone had a demand for seed soaking, he also held a forum with them to discuss the scientific principles of seed soaking and sterilization, consolidating their confidence in seed soaking, and these households led the propaganda. Most of the masses in Siliying Village have begun to soak their seeds. It is now being gradually promoted. (Chenguang)

　　建屏专区白地快种完
  　全力迎接麦收
  　清苑号召麦田选种
    【察哈尔讯】建屏专区布置当前生产工作，号召组织全力迎接麦收。五月二十四日，地委书记梁玉清同志，在县书、县长、青妇委联席会议上，对春季以来的生产工作，作了全面的总结检查，说明当前的白地抢种大体完成，麦收即将到来，应抓紧季节，准备迎接麦收：一、首先应深刻认识目前劳畜力的缺乏，必须广泛发挥各式各样互助组的作用。在组织当中，应注意防止强迫命令与自流现象，以支部为核心发动青年、妇女各系统力量，开展一个麦收突击运动，并动员种麦少的山岳地带和受雹灾的地区（灵寿、平山部分村庄）到种麦多的平原区卖工，要有重点的组织短工市工资要双方自由协定。二、进一步深入检查代耕，彻底解决问题，以保证烈、军、工属的麦子及时收割。三、在麦收期间，应提高警惕，注意防止坏分子趁机煽动抢劫和偷盗，反对麻痹太平观念，加强护麦工作。四、教育群众，打破麦子不选种的旧习惯，党员模范带头，发动妇女，进行田间选种。五、随熟、随割、随打，防止雨风雹等天灾的意外侵袭。六、结合麦收，利用麦糠，麦秸压肥上地。准备播种晚苗。七、加强医务工作，及时消灭病灾，作到人强马壮，全力突击完成麦收。八，在麦收中，推进社应收一部贷粮，准备以后出贷和贷给新受灾区，必须纠正干部中怕麻烦的懒惰想法。以上各项工作，即应马上向群众宣传，具体组织力量，进行突击。（建屏支社永彬、赵纯）
    【冀中讯】保南清苑地区小麦发生严重黑疸灾害。麦田歉收群众很焦虑。灾害发生原因，据六区新安铺王洛康谈，是去年麦种就有黑疸病穗所致。他家去年麦季打场因有黑疸穗把场都染黑了，种时怕出不来就从亲戚家借了四斗，又在集上买了三斗，种了九亩，用自己家中的麦种耩了三亩。今年一起浇一起锄上的一样的粪，结果，那九亩中黑疸穗很少，自己种子的三亩，黑病穗严重到百分之八十以上。加之黑疸穗与好麦穗一样，不易区别，大都到打场时才发现，种时又不浸种选种，病害传染愈来愈多。今年五月十六号到二十号五天中天气炎热潮雾多，又缺风正赶麦子开花灌浆，易于黑疸病菌的滋长传染，遂造成严重灾害。县委根据以上调查情况发出号召，在今年麦熟季节，发动组织群众进行田间选种，挑选抗害性强的麦种。秋后进行浸种。病灾严重的地区，秋种时并调换优良麦种。以免病害遗传。并指示目前播种大秋作物期间，组织领导群众进行浸种选种。介绍优良品种，早作预防减少病害。（霍国彬、马志一、段明琴、晨光）
    【又讯】清苑十一区麦田黑疸病害严重，在播种大秋作物时，区委已遵照县委指示，以麦田爱害的例子教育群众，大力提倡选种浸种，以防灾害。该区苑区长在四里营村亲自领导，作了浸种选种宣传后，群众有的接受了，但都反映不会浸，怕烫坏了种子，出不了芽。苑区长除介绍浸种办法外，并亲自教给村干部韩××家浸种，叫了七个老乡来看，耩上后，五天就出齐了，比没浸的早出一天，苗非常齐正。打破了群众的顾虑。在大家有了浸种要求后，又给他们座谈了浸种、杀菌的科学道理，巩固了他们浸种信心，由这几户带动宣传。四里营村群众大部开始浸起种来。现正逐步推广中。　　　　　　　　　（晨光）
