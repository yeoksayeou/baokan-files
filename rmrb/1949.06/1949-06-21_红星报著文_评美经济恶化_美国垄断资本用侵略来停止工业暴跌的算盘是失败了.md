Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 20th: TASS Moscow, 19th: Red Star newspaper published an article by its commentator entitled "The Deteriorating American Economic Situation."

    The commentator wrote: Recently, foreign newspaper reports have revealed that the American economic situation has further deteriorated. The American ruling clique is attempting to conceal the truth from the broad masses of the American people with reassuring words, but official and private statistics confirm the continuous reduction in industrial production. The U.S. industrial production index (with the average of 1935-1939 as 100) was 199 in August of last year, 185 in February of this year, 181 in March, 179 in April, and 174 in May. Even in some industries that have been the most stable in the American economy until now, a reduction in production can be seen. For example, the figures cited by the American Iron and Steel Institute show that at the beginning of the third week of June, the steel industry only operated at 86.7 percent of its production capacity. This is the lowest point in ten years.

    In the major light industries—textile, leather, rubber, and other industries—a sharp reduction in production can be seen. The continuous decline of stocks in the securities market is a direct consequence of the reduction in industrial production. Since the beginning of June, the total value of registered stocks in the securities market has fallen by 3 billion US dollars.

    The commentator continued: The same phenomenon can be strongly felt in the sales of goods in the United States. Goods that cannot find a market have piled up in warehouses. Sales in department stores decreased by 8 percent in the first week of June compared to the same week last year. Consumer debt incurred through installment payment plans has increased from 6.6 billion US dollars in late 1945 to 16 billion US dollars at the end of 1948. The number of bankruptcies has also increased. The Dun & Bradstreet statistical agency reported on June 2nd that 206 companies went bankrupt in just one week.

    The commentator pointed out: As always, monopoly capital is trying to shift the burden of the increasing economic difficulties onto the shoulders of the working masses. There are daily reports of layoffs. According to union materials, the number of unemployed in the United States is close to six million, not including a large number of partially employed workers.

    American monopoly capital groups are trying to find a way to escape the increasing difficulties by expanding their plans for economic expansion in foreign markets and intensifying the arms race. However, the most far-sighted representatives of the business community understand very well that neither the Marshall Plan nor the arms race plan can free the United States from the further deterioration of its economic situation.

    The commentator concluded: The deterioration of the American economic situation powerfully proves that the American monopoly capital's calculation of using aggressive diplomacy to halt the industrial slump has failed.

    评美经济恶化
    美国垄断资本用侵略来停止工业暴跌的算盘是失败了
    【新华社北平二十日电】塔斯社莫斯科十九日讯：红星报发表该报评论员所作“美国经济情势恶化”一文。
    评论员写道：最近，国外报章消息透露，美国经济形势已进一步恶化。美国统治集团企图用安定人心的话，来从广大的美国人民群众面前掩盖事情的真象，但是，官方与私人方面的统计数字，证实了工业生产的节节减削。美国工业生产指数（以一九三五——一九三九年的平均数为一○○）去年八月为一九九，今年二月为一八五，三月为一八一，四月为一七九，五月为一七四。甚至在迄今为止一直是美国经济中最稳定的一些工业中。也可以看见生产的缩减。譬如，美国钢铁研究所所引据的数字，就表明在六月份第三周的开始时，炼钢业仅开动该业生产力的百分之八十六点七。这是十年来的最低点。
    在主要的轻工业——纺织、皮革、橡皮等工业中，则可以看到生产的急剧削减。证券市场股票的不断下跌，是工业生产量缩减的直接后果。从六月初起，证券市场登记股票的总值跌落三十亿元。
    评论员继称：在美国的货物销售方面，可以强烈的感到同样的现象。找不到市场的货物，已堆积在仓库中。百货商店的售货量，六月份的第一周较去年同一周减少百分之八。消费者按照分期付款计划购买货物所负的债务，已自一九四五年后期的六十六亿元，增至一九四八年年终时的一百六十亿元。破产的数目也有增加，邓·布列德斯特统计机关六月二日报告，仅仅在一个星期中，即有二百零六家公司破产。
    评论员指出：象往常一样，垄断资本竭力将日益增加的经济困难的负担，转嫁到工人群众的肩上。天天都有解雇工人的消息。根据工会的材料，美国失业人数已近六百万人，大量的部分就业者尚不计算在内。
    美国垄断资本集团，竭力扩大他们在国外市场进行经济扩张的计划和加紧军备竞赛，企图用这样的方法来寻找逃脱日益增加的困难的道路。但是，看得最远的企业界的代表非常明白，不论是马歇尔计划，或者是军备竞赛计划，都不能使美国解脱经济形势的进一步恶化。
    评论员结语称：美国经济形势的恶化，有力的证明美国垄断资本用侵略外交政策来停止工业暴落的算盘是失败了。
