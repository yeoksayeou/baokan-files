An Overview of Salt Production and Sales in the Liberated Areas in 1948
廖季立 (Liao Jili)

China is one of the world's famous salt-producing regions. The major salt-producing areas in the country include Huaihe River region, Changlu, Hedong, Liangzhe, Shandong, Fujian, Northeast, Liangguang, Sichuan, Yunnan, and Shaanxi-Gansu. By the time the army crossed the river in 1949, the main liberated salt areas included Northeast, Changlu, Huaihe River region, Shandong, Hedong, and part of Shaanxi-Gansu. According to rough estimates, the national average salt production in previous years was roughly 60 million piculs per year. According to the Kuomintang Salt Administration, the national salt production in 1947 was 60 million piculs (of which 10 million piculs were old stock), and in 1948 it was estimated to be 90 million piculs. The actual production in 1948 did not reach this number, but it is estimated to be around 70 million piculs. If this number is more reliable, then the salt production in the liberated salt areas last year accounted for more than 50% of the total national production. The following is an introduction to the production overview of the liberated salt areas, based on the available incomplete materials:

Changlu: The Changlu salt field area totals 327,200 mu, equivalent to 627 salt farms, of which 569 have been developed, with 586 windmills, 232 motors, and 6,500 workers. In addition, the Jidong Daqinghe salt field has a salt field area of 223,300 mu, equivalent to 216 salt farms, of which 113 have been developed, with 39 windmills, 59 waterwheels, and 1,204 workers. According to Kuomintang sources, Changlu's production in the past two years was 7.3 million piculs in 1947 and 13 million piculs in 1948 (recent reports in the Tianjin Daily also state this number, which is credible). Adding the 460,000 piculs produced by the Daqinghe salt field last year, the Changlu area produced approximately 13.46 million piculs in 1948.

Shandong: Shandong's salt production has developed significantly under the active management and support of our democratic government during the Anti-Japanese War. According to Shandong statistical materials in 1946, the total salt field area in Shandong was 138,178 mu, of which 100,739 mu were developed, with 32,398 workers (no comprehensive statistical materials have been obtained for the past two years, but it is estimated that the number of developed salt fields and workers is even greater than before). According to Shandong statistics (excluding Qingdao), Shandong's salt production was 5.04 million piculs in 1947 and 10.35 million piculs in 1948. In addition, the Qingdao salt field, which will soon be liberated, produced 5 million piculs last year.

Northeast: The Northeast salt area is mainly located in the Liaodong Peninsula. Before the September 18th Incident, the highest annual production reached over 9.1 million piculs. Since liberation, as of September 1948, 4,100 salt fields (i.e., salt ponds) have been restored, 1,100 horsepower of electricity has been repaired and added, more than 64,300 meters of small railway materials have been added, more than 1,500 beach houses have been built, and more than 11,000 workers have been employed. According to the Northeast Daily, the actual production in 1948 exceeded 10 million piculs.

Huaihe River region: The Huaihe River region salt field area is approximately 300,000 mu. However, since the Qing Dynasty, due to changes in natural conditions, the annual production in Huainan has been only around 1.2 million piculs. The main salt production is in Huaibei. The average annual production from 1945 to 1946 was approximately 9 million to 10 million piculs. In 1948, due to the impact of the Kuomintang reactionaries' civil war, the actual production was only 4 million piculs.

Hedong: According to 1946 statistics, the Hedong salt field area was 138,178 mu, of which 100,739 mu were developed. Since liberation, there have been 48 salt merchants and 4,299 workers. The actual production in 1948 was 800,000 piculs.

The above major salt areas in the liberated areas produced a total of over 38.6 million piculs in 1948. Adding the estimated 1 million piculs from Yanbei and northern Shaanxi, the total for the liberated areas last year was approximately 40 million piculs, accounting for approximately 57% of the national salt production of 70 million piculs last year.

The overview of salt production in the country and the liberated areas has been described above. Now let's understand the situation of salt sales. Before the Anti-Japanese War, the total annual domestic and foreign salt sales in the country were approximately 45 million piculs. The situation during the Anti-Japanese War is unknown. In recent years, the annual domestic and foreign sales have been approximately 55 million piculs (according to the Kuomintang Ministry of Finance's response to inquiries from the Kuomintang Senate in 1947, domestic sales that year were approximately 46 million piculs and foreign sales were 10 million piculs). Among them, domestic sales include salt for food, salt for fishery, salt for agriculture, and salt for industry, requiring at least 41 to 42 million piculs; foreign sales have been 12 to 13 million piculs annually in recent years.

The domestic and foreign sales situation in the salt areas of the liberated areas is introduced separately below, based on the existing extremely incomplete materials:

Changlu: The Changlu domestic sales area includes Hebei and Chahar provinces, as well as parts of Shanxi and Henan. It supplies a population of approximately 60 million people, with annual sales of 5 to 6 million piculs. Adding foreign sales, according to statistics from the former Tianjin Kuomintang government, actual sales in 1947 were 9.3 million piculs. There are no accurate statistics for 1948, but it is possible that approximately 8 million piculs were sold.

Shandong: Based on the development in recent years, the domestic sales area has expanded to northern Anhui, eastern Henan, northern Yue, Taihang, central Hebei, and other places, along with the old sales areas such as Bohai, Jiaodong, and central and southern Shandong, supplying a population of over 63 million people. However, foreign sales are difficult. Actual sales in 1948 were over 6.1 million piculs.

Northeast: Domestic sales are in the Northeast provinces and foreign sales are in Korea and other places, supplying a population of approximately 40 million people in the mainland. Annual domestic sales of salt for food, industry, and fishery are 5 to 6 million piculs, and foreign sales are approximately 4 to 5 million piculs. It is estimated that most of the 10 million piculs produced in 1948 can be sold.

Huaihe River region: The original domestic sales area was the widest, covering most or part of Jiangsu, Anhui, Shandong, Henan, Hunan, Hubei, and Jiangxi provinces, supplying a population of approximately 120 million people. In recent years, due to the reduction in production in the Huaihe River region, the salt produced in 1948 was far from sufficient to supply the demand.

Hedong: Domestic sales are in 122 counties in Shanxi, Shaanxi, and Henan, supplying a population of approximately 17 to 18 million people. Including other uses of salt, annual sales are 2 million piculs. The 800,000 piculs produced in 1948 were all sold, but still felt insufficient.

The total salt sales in 1948 were over 28.9 million piculs. Adding the estimated 1 million piculs produced in Yanbei and northern Shaanxi, which can all be sold, the total salt sales in the liberated salt areas in 1948 were approximately 30 million piculs, accounting for 54% of the total national salt sales.

This is the basic situation of salt production and sales in 1948.

As for the problems that still exist in the solved salt areas in terms of salt production, salt transportation, salt sales, and salt tax, and the root causes of these problems, this article does not elaborate on them and will be discussed in another article later.

　　一九四八年解放区食盐产销概况
    廖季立
    中国为世界有名的盐产区之一，全国主要产盐区计有两淮、长芦、河东、两浙、山东、福建、东北、两广、四川、云南、陕甘等处。截至一九四九年大军渡江以前，已解放的主要盐区计有东北、长芦、两淮、山东、河东以及陕甘一部。全国历年盐户的不甚确切的计算，每年平均大致在六千万市担上下。近二年产量，据伪盐政总局宣称：一九四七年全国产盐六千万市担（按其中有一千万担系旧存），一九四八年估计可产九千万担。按一九四八年实产未到此数，估计可产到七千万担左右。如以此数较为可靠，则现有解放的盐区去年盐产即约占全国总产量的百分之五十以上。兹将已解放的盐区生产概况，据现有不完全材料，分别介绍如下：
    长芦　长芦盐田面积共有三十二万七千二百亩，合盐滩六百二十七付，已经营五百六十九付，用有风车五百八十六架，马达二百三十二个，工人六千五百名。此外，冀东大清河盐场有盐田二十二万三千三百亩，合盐滩二百一十六付，已经营一百一十三付，用风车三十九架，水车五十九架，工人一千二百零四名。长芦近二年产量，据伪方宣称：一九四七年实产七百三十余万担，一九四八年可产一千三百万担（最近天津日报报导亦为此数，可以相信），加上大清河盐场去年实产四十六万担，长芦全区一九四八年约产一千三百四十六万市担。
    山东　山东盐产经过抗战时期我民主政府的积极经营与扶助，有很大发展，据一九四六年山东统计材料，山东盐田总面积为一十三万八千一百七十八亩，已经营面积十万零七千二百三十九亩，工人三万二千三百九十八名（近二年未得全面统计材料，估计经营盐田与工人数目较前更大）。山东盐产（不包括青岛）据山东统计：一九四七年实产五百零四万市担，一九四八年实产一千零三十五万市担。此外即将解放的青岛盐场去年实产五百万市担。
    东北　东北盐区主要在辽东半岛，九一八事变前，最高年产达九百一十余万担。自解放后截至一九四八年九月，已恢复盐田四千一百付斗（即出盐池子），修复添置电力一千一百马力，小铁道材料六万四千三百余米，滩房一千五百余幢，工人一万一千余人。据东北日报报导，一九四八年实产一千万市担有余。
    两淮　两淮盐田面积约有三十余万亩，惟淮南自清季受自然条件变化以来，年产不过一百二十万担上下，主要盐产在淮北。一九四五年至一九四六年平均年产约九百万至一千万市担，一九四八年因受国民党反动派内战影响，实产仅四百万市担。
    河东　河东盐田面积据一九四六年统计材料为一十三万八千一百七十八亩，已经营十万零七千二百三十九亩，解放后截至现在晒商已有四十八家，工人四千二百九十九人。一九四八年实产八十万市担。
    以上各解放区的主要盐区一九四八年共实产三千八百六十余万市担。再加上雁北及陕北盐估计为一百万担，则去年解放区总计约为四千万市担，约占全国去年产盐七千万担的百分之五十七。
    全国及解放区的盐产概况已如上述，现在再来了解一下销盐情况。抗战前全国每年内外销盐大致在四千五百万市担左右，抗战时期不详。近二、三年来大致每年内外销约可销到五千五百万担上下（一九四七年据伪财政部答伪参政会质问中，该年内销约四千六百万担，外销一千万担）。其中内销包括食盐、渔业用盐、农业用盐及工业用盐，最低约需四千一、二百万担；外销近年每年为一千二、三百万担。
    各解放区的盐区内销与外销情况，依现有极不完全材料，分别介绍如下：
    长芦　长芦内销区包括河北及察哈尔二省以及山西一部与河南一部。供给食用人口约六千万人左右，每年可销盐五、六百万担，加上外销，据前天津伪市政府统计，一九四七年实销九百三十万担，一九四八年还无正确统计，可能销出八百万担左右。
    山东　依近几年发展情况，内销地区已扩大至皖北、豫东、北岳、太行、冀中等地连同旧有销岸如渤海、胶东及鲁中、鲁南等地，供给食用人口达六千三百余万人。惟外销困难。一九四八年实销六百一十余万担。
    东北　内销东北各省及外销朝鲜等地，供内地食用人口约四千万人上下，年可内销食用及工业渔业等用盐五、六百万担，外销年约四、五百万担。一九四八年所产一千万担估计大部可以销出。
    两淮　原内销地区最广，计可销苏、皖、鲁、豫、湘、鄂、赣等七省的大部或一部，供给食用人口约一万万二千万人，近年因两淮减产，一九四八年所产之盐，实远不足供应。
    河东　内销晋、陕、豫一百二十二县，供食用人口约一千七、八百万人，连同其他用盐每年可销二百万担。一九四八年所产之八十万担，除全数销完外，尚感不足。
    以上一九四八年共销盐为二千八百九十余万担，加上雁北陕北估计所产之一百万担全部可以销出，则一九四八年已解决之盐区销盐总计大约为三千万市担，已解放的盐区销盐占全国总销量的百分之五十四。
    这就是一九八四年食盐产销的基本情况。
    至于目前已解决了的盐区在盐产方面、盐运方面、盐销方面以及盐税方面还存在那些问题？这些问题的根源何在？本文未及详述，以后再另文讨论。
