    Hebei Central Areas Affected by Hailstorms
    Striving for Increased Production Through Emergency Replanting
    [Our Dispatch] In 68 districts of 23 counties including Daqing, Gaoyang, Xianxian, and Wuqiang in the Hebei Central Area, hailstorms occurred on June 6th, 7th and 8th, causing significant losses. The Hebei Central Administrative Office specifically instructed all counties on June 13th to immediately organize forces to go deep into the disaster areas based on the extent of the damage, seize the season, and mobilize the masses to carry out emergency replanting. It also called for organizing mass sideline production, launching a conservation campaign, and earnestly resolving difficulties in the lives and production of the masses. To ensure the completion of this year's production increase plan, various localities have successively launched emergency replanting work, on the one hand mobilizing rural able-bodied and semi-able-bodied labor to speed up wheat harvesting and gleaning, and on the other hand carrying out spot planting and replanting according to the extent of damage to the seedlings, advocating deep hoeing and multiple hoeings; in areas where seedlings have been completely destroyed, land should be cultivated immediately, ensuring that each cultivated piece of land is planted. Party and government leading cadres in Xianxian, Wen'an, Renqiu, Hejian, Huanghua and other counties in the Eighth Administrative Area have personally gone to the countryside to lead planting. Wen'an has already loaned 30,000 catties of seeds. In addition to mobilizing farmers to help each other with borrowing, Gaoyang County has prepared 15,000 catties of seeds for corn, late millet, and soybeans, which will be loaned to poor farmers without seeds in a timely manner. Suning has prepared 5,000 catties each of small peanut seeds and late seedling seeds. In terms of sideline production, Gaoyang plans to allocate a number of looms to organize disaster-stricken people to produce for self-relief. The masses in all disaster-stricken villages in Gaoyang in the Ninth Administrative Area have generally taken action, and half of the wheat in the first, second, fourth, sixth, and seventh districts has also been harvested. The masses are seizing the opportunity to glean wheat grains during the wheat harvest. Men, women, and children are holding winnowing fans, brooms, etc., some are cutting, sweeping, and drying at the same time, and some households are sweeping several dou per day.
