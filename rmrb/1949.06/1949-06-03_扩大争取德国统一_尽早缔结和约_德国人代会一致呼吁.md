Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 2nd: TASS Berlin dispatch: On May 30th, the Third German People's Congress continued to discuss the reports by Nuschke, Professor Kassner, Müller, and Ledebour (representing Lehmann, who was arrested by the British military authorities). Thirty-one representatives (including thirteen representatives from the Western occupation zones), spoke on the first agenda item, "Germany and the Paris Conference," at the evening meeting on May 29th and the morning meeting on May 30th. Supporters of various political parties and representatives from the broadest strata expressed a common all-German anxiety regarding the threat of national division and opposition to a just peace and the restoration of a unified peacetime economy. The speakers called for the Four Foreign Ministers Conference to reach an agreement on maintaining German unity, concluding a peace treaty with Germany as soon as possible, and withdrawing the occupying forces. The representatives supported the proposal to expand the German People's Congress movement to establish a national front of all patriots throughout Germany.

The Congress then proceeded to the most important part of its work—the adoption of the "Declaration to the German People on Expanding the National Front for German Reunification and a Just Peace Treaty." The declaration was passed by a majority of 2,013 votes, with two votes against and one abstention.

The election of the German delegation to attend the Paris Foreign Ministers Conference was extremely enthusiastic. In addition to the list of candidates representing various political parties, mass organizations, and the German economic and cultural circles, Lehmann, a fighter for German reunification and leader of the West German Communist Party, was also included among the candidates. The Congress unanimously elected the 22-member delegation to the Paris Conference. Chairman Pieck expressed the hope that the delegation would be able to speak at the Paris Foreign Ministers Conference because the delegation is "entitled to represent the demands and aspirations of the entire German people."

The Third German People's Congress elected 330 members of the German People's Council and authorized the German People's Council to increase the representation of the Western occupation zones in its composition.

The last item on the agenda of the Third German People's Congress was the constitution of the German Democratic Republic. Grotewohl, Chairman of the Constitutional Committee of the German People's Council, made a report on this issue. After listening to speeches by several representatives, the Congress passed the following resolution: The Third German People's Congress agrees to the draft "Constitution of the German People's Republic" passed by the German People's Council on March 19, 1949. Thus, the Third German People's Congress completed its work.

    第三届德国人民代表大会选举了三百三十名德国人民委员会委员，并授权德国人民委员会得在其成份中增加西占区的代表。
    第三届德国人民代表大会议程的最后一项是德国民主共和国的宪法问题。德国人民委员会宪法委员会主席格罗提渥就这一问题作报告。在听取几位代表的演说后，大会通过如下决议：第三届德国人民代表大会同意德国人民委员会于一九四九年三月十九日通过的“德国人民共和国宪法”草案。这样，第三届德国人民代表就完成了它的工作。
