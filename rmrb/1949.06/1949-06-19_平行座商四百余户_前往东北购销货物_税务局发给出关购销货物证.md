　　More Than 400 Fixed Location Merchants
  　Travel to the Northeast to Purchase and Sell Goods
  　Tax Bureau Issues Exit Permits for Purchasing and Selling Goods
    [This Newspaper's Report] Material exchanges between Beiping and the Northeast region are gradually becoming more active. The Beiping Tax Bureau has now issued "Purchase and Sale of Goods Permits" to 263 fixed location merchants (statistics from May 26th to June 18th) and 171 itinerant merchants (statistics from June 4th to June 18th) for travel to the Northeast. The majority are going to the Northeast to purchase grain or to sell rubber products and cloth.
    Any merchants traveling to the Northeast to purchase and sell goods without a "Purchase and Sale of Goods Permit" will not be permitted by the Northeast tax authorities to purchase or sell goods. In order to facilitate commercial exchange between merchants and the Northeast region and to benefit material exchange, the Beiping Municipal Tax Bureau is providing special convenience to merchants applying for "Purchase and Sale of Goods Permits for Travel to the Northeast." Fixed location merchants can directly go to the relevant district tax sub-bureaus to apply by presenting the business license issued by the Bureau of Industry and Commerce, and itinerant merchants can apply by presenting their household registration form. The purchase and sale permit for fixed location merchants is valid for one month. Upon arrival at the destination for purchasing and selling goods, they should immediately complete the verification procedure with the local tax authorities. The purchase and sale permit obtained by itinerant merchants is valid for one time only. After returning from purchasing and selling goods at the destination, they should immediately submit the original permit to the original issuing tax bureau to declare and pay the itinerant merchant business tax and temporary income tax.

　　平行座商四百余户
  　前往东北购销货物
  　税务局发给出关购销货物证
    【本报讯】北平与东北区间物资交流渐趋畅旺，平市现经北平税局发给赴东北“购销货物证”之座商已有二六三户（五月二十六日开始至六月十八日之统计）、行商一七一人（六月四日开始至六月十八日之统计），大部为赴东北采购粮食或至东北销售橡胶制品及布匹者。
    凡赴东北购销货物之商民如无“购销货物证”，东北税务机关即不准其购销货品。北平市税务局为便利商民与东北区商业往来，以利物资交流，对请领“赴东北购销货证”之商人特别予以便利，凡座商持工商局发给之营业证，行商持户口单即可迳赴各该区税务分局请领。座商之购销证限用一个月，到达购销货物目的地时应即向该地税务机关办理查验证明手续，行商领取之购销证限用一次，于自目的地购销货物返回后，应即持原证向原发税务局申报完纳行商营业税及一时所得税。
