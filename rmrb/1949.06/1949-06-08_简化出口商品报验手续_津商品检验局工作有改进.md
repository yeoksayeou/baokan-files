　　【Tianjin Electric】Since the Tianjin Commodity Inspection Bureau was taken over by the People's Government, it has been transformed, after rectification, from a corrupt and bureaucratic agency under the Kuomintang government to an organization that promotes foreign trade and improves the quality of export commodities. Before the liberation of Tianjin, it took at least three days to inspect a batch of goods at the bureau; now it generally takes only half a day or a day. The bureau strives to simplify procedures. After the commodity inspection is qualified, it will first issue a release order to avoid the trouble of exporters waiting for the inspection certificate, so as to handle customs clearance and shipment as soon as possible. The bureau has also gradually and reasonably revised the standards for the inspection of certain commodities and sent people to factories to assist and guide technology. Therefore, the quality of export goods has gradually improved. For example, of the mustard seeds declared for inspection in April, five out of six batches were unqualified; in May, only three out of ten batches were unqualified. According to the bureau's statistics from April to mid-May, 96% of the commodities declared for inspection have passed the inspection. The main reason for the bureau's achievements is that after the People's Government took over the bureau, it led all employees in three months of political study, which made them realize the mistakes of past corruption and began to establish the concept of serving the people; personnel were appropriately adjusted, serious corrupt elements in the past were washed away, and technical personnel were given certain research and work convenience, and necessary instruments and tools were added.

　　简化出口商品报验手续　津商品检验局工作有改进
    【天津电】津市商品检验局自人民政府接管以后，经过整顿，已由在国民党政府管理时期的贪污腐化的官僚机构，开始变为促进对外贸易，提高出口商品质量的机关。在天津解放前，该局检验一批商品至少需要三天时间，现在一般地只用半天或一天。该局力求简化手续，商品检验合格后就先发给放行单，免去出口商等候检验合格证书的麻烦，以便及早办理结关及装运。该局并逐步地合理地改订某些商品检验的标准，和派人到工厂协助指导技术，因此出口货物的品质已逐渐提高。如四月份报验的芥子中，六批有五批不合格，五月份，十批中只有三批不合格。据该局四月份至五月中旬的统计，报验商品经检验合格者，已达百分之九十六。该局获得这些成绩的主要原因是人民政府接管该局后，曾领导全局员工进行了三个月的政治学习，使他们认识到过去贪污腐化的错误，开始树立了为人民服务的观点；适当地调整了人事，洗刷了过去严重的贪污分子，同时给予技术人员以某些研究与工作上的便利，添置了必要的仪器、工具等。
