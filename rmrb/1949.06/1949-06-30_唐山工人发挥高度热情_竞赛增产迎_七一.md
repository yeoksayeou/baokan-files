　　【Tangshan Electric】Workers from various sections of the Tangshan and Guye Railways, the Tangshan Railway Factory, and the Tangshan Steel Plant are working overtime with unparalleled enthusiasm to increase production and welcome "July 1st." The Tangshan Railway Locomotive Depot, with locomotive No. 602, and the Guye Locomotive Depot, with locomotives such as No. 1612, have successively launched a challenge competition to all North China Railway Locomotive Depots to safely travel 40,000 kilometers. Employees of the Tangshan Railway Factory have also decided to work overtime before "July 1st" to rush production and complete the June production plan ahead of schedule. The factory's tool bureau responded to the challenge from the Changxindian Locomotive Depot with a letter of acceptance, guaranteeing to exceed the June work plan by more than 20%, ensuring excellent quality of all components, and unanimously expressing their determination to thoroughly implement conservation and abide by labor discipline. In addition to completing the repair of boiler No. 1565, the boiler repair team will also repair two boilers ahead of schedule. Other teams have also proposed working one hour of overtime each day without pay. All workers in the factory also voluntarily take responsibility for cleaning and tidying up their units during their spare time, freeing up twelve workers to participate in production in various teams. The factory workers originally stationed at the locomotive yard decided to complete the renovation of sixteen locomotives in June, and to rush to repair armored train No. 581 before the 25th as a gift for "July 1st." Workers at the Tangshan Steel Plant also started the plant's No. 2 regenerative steelmaking furnace on the 18th of this month. Now, both No. 1 and No. 2 steelmaking furnaces are in use simultaneously, eliminating the need for switching furnaces during breakdowns, and striving to ensure that steelmaking is not delayed for even a minute.

    【唐山电】唐山、古冶铁路各站段、唐山铁路工厂、唐山制钢厂各单位员工，正以无比的劳动热情加班增产，迎接“七一”。唐山铁路机务段以六零二号机车、古冶机务段以一六一二号等三台机车先后向全华北铁路机务段提出安全行走四万公里的挑战竞赛，唐山铁路工厂职工也决定在“七一”前加班突击生产，提前完成六月份的生产计划。该厂工具局对长辛店机务段的挑战，提出了应战书，保证超过六月份工作计划百分之二十以上，成员质量均保证优良，并一致表示要彻底实行节约，遵守劳动纪律。制炉所除完成修理一台一五六五号锅炉外，还要提前修好两个锅炉，其他各组也都提出每天加班一小时，不要工资。全场各组工友并自动在工余负责本单位的清扫整理工作，省出工友十二名分别参加各组生产。机车场原建立所的工厂们决定在六月份除完成装修十六台机车外，并在二十五日以前突击修好五八一号铁甲车一辆，做为“七一”献礼。唐山制钢厂的工友们也在本月十八日把该厂二号发热式炼钢大炉开动起来，现在一、二两号炼钢炉同时使用，免去了发生故障时换炉的衔接过程，争取做到了炼钢不误一分钟。
