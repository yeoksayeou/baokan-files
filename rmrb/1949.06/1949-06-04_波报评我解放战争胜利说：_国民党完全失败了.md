Xinhua News Agency, Beiping, 3rd: Warsaw Dispatch: "Worker's Voice," the organ of the Polish United Workers' Party, commented on the victory of the Chinese People's Liberation War, saying: "Now we see with our own eyes that the Kuomintang has completely failed, and China under Chiang Kai-shek's rule is no longer an organized unit." The newspaper recounted the amount of American aid to the Kuomintang and then stated: "This example proves that neither imperialist pressure nor large amounts of dollars can break the people's will to fight for liberation under the leadership of a revolutionary party."

　　波报评我解放战争胜利说：
    国民党完全失败了
    【新华社北平三日电】华沙讯：波兰统一工人党机关报工人呼声报评论中国人民解放战争的胜利称：现在我们亲眼看见国民党完全失败了，蒋介石统治下的中国已不再是一个有组织的单位。该报追述了美国对国民党援助的数量之后称：这个例子证明了，不论是帝国主义的压力或是大量美元，都不能打破人民在革命政党领导下争取解放的意志。
