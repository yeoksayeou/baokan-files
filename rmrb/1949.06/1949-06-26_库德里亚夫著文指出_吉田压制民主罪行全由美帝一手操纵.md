　　Kudryavtsev's Article Points Out
　　Yoshida's Crimes of Suppressing Democracy Were Entirely Manipulated by U.S. Imperialism
　　【Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 25th】 Moscow Dispatch: The News (消息报) published an article by Kudryavtsev on the 23rd, accusing the U.S. occupation authorities of being responsible for supporting the Japanese reactionaries in suppressing the democratic movement. The article pointed out that the little democratic rights obtained by the Japanese people after the defeat of the Japanese militarists in 1945 are being unscrupulously deprived by the reactionary Yoshida government. After listing many facts of the Yoshida government using "police terror" to suppress the democratic movement, the author especially emphasized that without the support and assistance of the U.S. occupation authorities, the Japanese government could not have realized its sinister plan. The U.S. occupation authorities should be responsible for all actions of the Japanese government. Kudryavtsev reminded that it was none other than MacArthur himself who launched the so-called "crusade" against the Japanese people's democratic movement, especially against its most organized force—the working class. As early as July 22, 1948, he suggested that the Japanese government deprive employees in government agencies and public utilities of the right to strike and conclude collective agreements. At present, the ban on strikes has been applied to all strike events disliked by the U.S. military authorities. However, Kudryavtsev forcefully stated that the Japanese people's democratic movement is growing stronger day by day. At present, progressive trade unions have the vast majority of employees in factories and government agencies; the prestige of democratic peasant organizations is also increasing day by day; and the number and strength of progressive intellectual groups are developing. These democratic groups unanimously and firmly support the principles of the Potsdam Declaration to realize the permanent democratization of Japan.

　　库德里亚夫著文指出
  　吉田压制民主罪行全由美帝一手操纵
    【新华社北平二十五日电】莫斯科讯：消息报二十三日发表库德里亚夫一文，指责美国占领当局应负扶植日本反动派镇压民主运动的责任。该文指出：日本人民在一九四五年日本军国主义者失败后所取得的一点点民主权利，正在被吉田反动政府肆无忌惮地剥夺着。作者在列举吉田政府利用“警察恐怖”以镇压民主运动的许多事实后，特别强调地指出：如果没有美国占领当局的支持和帮助，日本政府决不能实现其罪恶计划。美国占领当局应对日本政府的一切行为负责。库德里亚夫提醒道：发动所谓“十字军”以反对日本人民民主运动，特别是反对其中最有组织的队伍——工人阶级，这不是别人，正是麦克阿瑟自己，他早在一九四八年七月二十二日，就建议日本政府剥夺政府机关及公用事业中职工的罢工和缔结集体协定的权利。目前，对于罢工的禁令，已适用于一切为美国军事当局所讨厌的罢工事件中。但库德里亚夫力称：日本人民民主运动正日益发展壮大起来。目前，进步的职工会已拥有绝大多数的工厂与政府机关的职工；民主的农民组织的威信也在一天天地增加；进步的知识分子团体的数目和力量都在发展中。这些民主团体一致地坚决支持波茨坦声明的原则，以实现日本永久的民主化。
