Xinhua News Agency, Peiping, June 9th: TASS reports: With the support of the Italian ruling clique, the United States is stepping up its efforts to consolidate its strategic position in the Mediterranean. According to recent news, the southern coast of Sicily is now practically entirely under US control. Sicilians are being hired to build US military facilities. A huge oil refinery has been established in Augusta (on the east coast of Sicily), its direct purpose being to supply the US Navy in the Mediterranean with gasoline. At the same time, the United States is converting the Italian islands of Pantelleria and Lampedusa into naval bases.

The US military in Sicily treats the Italians with rudeness and disrespect, thereby arousing the indignation of people from all walks of life. Citizens of Palermo held demonstrations in front of the US consulate. The people support the People's Front, which is fighting against the reduction of Italy to a US colony, as was clearly demonstrated in the Palermo by-election in May. The People's Front won overwhelming victories over the government party in many places.

　　美帝修建地中海军事基地
  　西西里人愤慨示威
    【新华社北平九日电】塔斯社讯：在意大利统治集团的支持下，美国正在加紧巩固在地中海的战略地位。据最近的消息，西西里岛的南海岸实际上已完全在美国的控制下。西西里人则被雇来修筑美国军事设备。巨大的炼油厂已在奥古斯塔（西西里东岸）设立，其直接目的是在供给地中海美国海军以汽油。同时美国正在将意大利的班泰雷利亚岛和兰佩鲁萨岛改装成海军基地。
    西西里美军以粗鲁无礼的态度对待意大利人，因而激起各阶层人民的愤慨。巴勒摩市民曾在美国领事馆前面举行示威。人民支持正在为反对将意大利沦为美国殖民地而斗争的人民阵线，在五月巴勒摩市的补缺选举中，清楚地表现出来了。人民阵线在不少地点赢得了政府党的压倒胜利。
