　　Shijiazhuang Suburbs Wheat Harvest Expected to Reach 80% of Normal Year
    [Shijiazhuang Electric] Wheat in the suburbs of Shijiazhuang is ripe. Military police, workers, and government cadres stationed inside and outside the city are actively assisting farmers in harvesting and safeguarding the crops. Although there was little snow last winter and a severe drought this spring, the wheat fields in the suburbs of Shijiazhuang are mostly irrigated, so they have not been significantly affected. This year's harvest is expected to reach 80% of a normal year.

　　石市郊区麦收可达八成年景
    【石家庄电】石市郊区小麦已熟，市内外驻地军警、工人、机关干部，纷纷协助农民进行收割和保卫工作。虽然去冬少雪，今春苦旱，而石市郊区麦田多是水浇地，所以尚未受害，今年收成可达八成年景。
