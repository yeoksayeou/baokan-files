　　New Heroes and Heroines
　　Chapter Ten: Sleeping on Ice
　　Don't waver in the face of difficulties!
　　--Chairman Mao's words
　　I.
　　Just as Zhang Jinlong raised his knife, someone shouted from behind, "Hey! Hey! Hold on!" Zhang Jinlong turned around and saw several people running up to him, saying, "The squad leader told you not to chop yet, hurry back!" Niu Dashui had already passed out, and at this moment he vaguely thought, "Am I dead? Why hasn't my head fallen off?" He felt dizzy and someone was carrying him away. Soon, he was back at the He family mansion and locked in a small room in the backyard again.

　　Zhang Jinlong was puzzled. He carried his broadsword into the north room where He Shixiong lived and saw the First Madam, the Old Master...quite a few people, all weeping; He Shixiong was furious and was losing his temper with a guard. Zhang Jinlong didn't dare to ask, and sat on the side to listen, only then did he understand that He Goupi had returned from the town and was hijacked by Liu Shuangxi and his people on the way; the guard was sent back to deliver a message, saying that He Goupi would be exchanged for Niu Dashui. They agreed on a location and set a deadline for handing over the person tomorrow, or else they would tear off his dog skin if Niu Dashui wasn't returned, and they would also take revenge.

　　Dashui woke up in the small room, touched his body, blood was everywhere. The blood-soaked clothes he was wearing were already stuck to him, and he couldn't take them off. He was in pain all over, as if he was being cut by random knives, more unbearable than when he was being tortured! He couldn't sit, and he couldn't lie down, so he leaned sideways, his head against the base of the wall, full of grievances, and began to cry.

　　He thought to himself, "Ah, how did I, Niu Dashui, end up in this state! If I hadn't come out to work and offended the villains, I wouldn't have suffered such great pain! I've gone to the eighteenth level of hell, crying to heaven and getting no response, crying to earth and getting no help, who knows my suffering!" He wanted to urinate, but his shorts were stuck together with blood and flesh; moving even slightly was extremely painful, so he had to urinate in his pants. The urine stung his wounds, making the pain even worse. Dashui really couldn't bear it any longer.

　　He cried and thought, "My mother! How can I endure this? I might as well just die. Once I die, I won't feel any pain or suffering!" He really wanted to die, but how could he die? He thought of many ways to commit suicide in a random manner, but none of them worked, he could only kill himself by banging his head.

　　Dashui barely opened one eye to look around. The room was very dark, but it was bright outside. Several sparrows were pecking at the window lattice, pecking and then flapping their wings and flying away. Dashui didn't know why, but he thought of Hei Lao Cai, Yang Xiaomei, and many comrades; but he didn't know where they were, they must still be persevering. He thought of the day when everyone raised their arms and swore, "We will not be pessimistic and waver no matter how difficult it is!" Dashui thought, "What was I thinking just now? I'm a Communist Party member, am I not as good as a commoner? The people are still persisting in resisting Japan, and I want to commit suicide after suffering a little torture, bah! I'm really confused!" His courage rose, his heart steeled, and he felt that the pain was not so intense.

　　Dashui thought about his mother—Wang Dama, about Yin Dabo, about many fellow villagers; braving danger and doing everything they could to rescue him, yet he himself wanted to commit suicide; haha, how could he face them? He leaned against the wall and found it funny himself: "Can I escape by not coming out to work? Many more common people have died, who is to blame for that! It's all those damn Japanese devils and traitors who harm people. Damn it, I, Niu Dashui, will not die! As long as I can live, I must take revenge!"

　　II.
　　Dashui woke up for a while and passed out for a while, vaguely passing a day. At night, he woke up again and felt himself swaying, hearing the sound of oars, and thought to himself, "Could it be that I'm on a boat? Are they going to throw me into the river to drown me?" He wanted to sit up and take a look, but he had no strength in his body, and he couldn't even lift his head, and he passed out again.

　　The boat arrived next to a reed marsh, and a small boat came out of the moat with a creaking sound. An old gentleman sat at the bow of the boat, the moonlight shining on his snow-white long beard, shimmering silver. He looked at the big boat with clear eyes and waved, and the two boats approached each other. He came aboard the big boat and met He Shixiong's father, and the two bowed and offered each other seats.

　　The puppet soldiers on the boat all put down their guns. The old gentleman Liang Guangting said, "They asked me to be a middleman, is Niu Dashui here?" He Shixiong's father pointed to him, and the old gentleman lifted the tattered quilt and was shocked. He felt Dashui's chest, slowly put down the quilt, and lowered his eyelids without saying a word.

　　The old man with the surname He hurriedly explained to the old gentleman, pushing the responsibility for beating Niu Dashui entirely onto the Japanese; and said that He Goupi would have to be sent over before Niu Dashui could be released. Old Mr. Liang sighed and said, "Ah, Taiong, I'm afraid I can't handle this matter! To tell you the truth, I've seen your young master, and they haven't even touched a hair on his head! Putting yourself in their shoes makes sense. But the man has become like this, what can I say? We can't cover the sky with one hand, or hide the earth with one hand! Their intention was to take Niu Dashui back first, and then send your young master over. If you don't want to, it will be even more difficult for me. " The two talked for a long time, but it was still the old gentleman who guaranteed that Niu Dashui would be sent over first.

　　Dashui was wrapped in a tattered quilt and carried onto the small boat. The small boat creaked and groaned as it drilled into the moat, and after winding around the reed marsh for a long time, it came to another reed marsh. The boatman whistled, and two small boats immediately emerged from the reeds, with Gao Tuncun, Shuangxi, and Niu Xiaoshui all scrambling to jump onto the boat.

　　When they saw that Dashui had been beaten into this state, they were all stunned. Gao Tuncun's teeth were gnashing and clanging, and he said, "This is outrageous! They beat our people half to death, we can't let this Goupi off!" Shuangxi hurriedly said, "We'll settle this debt with them later, now that the person is back, don't embarrass the old gentleman." Unexpectedly, the child Xiaoshui wiped his tears and jumped back onto the other boat without saying a word, pulled out his knife, and cut off He Goupi's nose with a snap. He Goupi was wearing "crow's eye" glasses and shouted for mercy. Niu Xiaoshui raised his knife and said, "If you shout again, I'll kill you!" Shuangxi hurriedly jumped over and pulled him away, saying, "Don't mess around! This won't solve the problem." Xiaoshui still cursed angrily, wiped the blood off his knife on the sole of his shoe, and inserted it into its sheath. A group of people carried Dashui over to this boat, and the old gentleman quickly sent He Goupi away.

　　In the middle of the night, two small boats rowed to a small village in the lake. This village had only thirty-odd households and was surrounded by water. Xiaomei and the others had also arrived here early and were waiting anxiously for Dashui to return. The landlady had prepared a kang bed and was waiting with a pot of boiling water. People carried Dashui in, and when Yang Xiaomei saw him, she couldn't help but feel a pang of sadness, looking at him with tears in her eyes. They gently placed Dashui on the kang bed and shone a light on him. When they uncovered the tattered quilt, all the comrades around him burst into tears.

　　Dashui—Dashui—originally such a strong young man, what a wreck he had become! His head was swollen like a big-headed doll, the dog bite wounds were full of maggots, all ten fingers were nailed with nails and were purple from the elbow down, and there wasn't a single piece of good flesh to be seen on his body! He was in a coma, only a sliver of breath remained.

　　The medic who was found from the county brigade gave Dashui an injection, and Dashui woke up. He opened his left eye, looked at Shuangxi, then looked at Xiaomei, then looked at Gao Tuncun, and as he looked, he suddenly sat up and shouted, "What? It's you!" Xiaomei hurriedly supported him, crying, "Dashui, you're back, you...you'll be alright!" A smile appeared on Dashui's swollen face: "I'm back, I'm back, I've finally seen you! Hahaha! Hahaha!..." He kept laughing, he kept talking nonsense, he was mad.

　　He was mad, and the comrades' hearts were as if something had bitten them, and they couldn't help but cry out.

　　III.

　　In autumn, enemies were everywhere on the dry land. A large watchtower every five li, a small watchtower every three li. Later, there were also enemies in Baiyangdian, and they built watchtowers in large villages and went to small villages often. The enemies collected taxes, pre-borrowed food, eating endlessly, with sesame oil, white flour, pork, and chicken every day...The people ate grass seeds, elm bark, sour seedlings, sweet potato leaves...Some dug wild vegetables, and some starved to death while digging. The environment was truly cruel and difficult!

　　Cheng Ping, Hei Lao Cai, and the others were still persevering on the dry land. Liu Shuangxi and his group were assigned to the western Baiyangdian. They controlled village cadres, contacted the masses, and fought against the enemy.

　　Niu Dashui was sick for a long time, relying entirely on the caring care of the fellow villagers, and the comrades taking turns to serve him. In that difficult environment, they often had to transfer. The villagers sometimes hid Dashui in caves, sometimes hid him on boats, and sometimes hid him in the reed marsh with a "small raft." Dashui's illness slowly improved; after the great autumn harvest, his injuries were almost healed, but his body was still very weak.

　　In winter, Baiyangdian froze. The sun shone on the ice, and it was crystal clear all around, with the blue of the sky reflected on the ice. The devils sat on ice sleds of the people, in long lines, running quickly on the ice to search each village. They knew that the "Eighth Route Army" was active, but they couldn't catch them.

　　Later, the enemy's "punitive expedition" transferred over from the dry land. For a time, large and small villages in this area were occupied by the devils; searching, ransacking, torturing the people...Shuangxi and some "red" village cadres were all withdrawn under the protection of the people and hid in the reed marshes of Baiyangdian. This year, the reed marshes of Baiyangdian all left "border reeds"—the people cut the reeds inside, leaving a circle of reeds around the perimeter to protect the Eighth Route Army.

　　For several days in a row, Shuangxi and his people lived on the ice in the reed marshes. When they were hungry, they divided the sesame cakes, cotton seed cakes, and bran buns mixed with wild vegetables that the people secretly sent; when they were thirsty, they chewed icicles. Shuangxi joked, "This is rock candy! One piece for each person, free of charge." Everyone crunched and crunched, chewing with great enthusiasm. When the landlady sent groudnut noodles, they would give it to Dashui. Dashui had a white cloth around his head, leaning back in Gao Tuncun's arms. He felt very sorry: "My injury is already healed, why should I eat good things?" He offered the bun back and forth, and in the end, he only ate half, and that half was divided into small pieces for everyone to eat. Xiaomei was wearing a broken cotton trousers that the people gave her, with a piece of cloth hanging from her knee. When the northwest wind blew, the cloth fluttered up and down. Xiu Nuer said to her, "Ha! You even have a curtain hanging on your pants!" Xiaomei couldn't help but laugh and said, "You naughty imp, don't embarrass me!"

　　The sun shone on the ice, stinging people's eyes. People sat in piles, sometimes holding discussion meetings, sometimes wiping guns; as they wiped, they would sing:

　　Gunshots ring,
　　Cannons boom,
　　The brutal enemy comes to besiege!
　　Not afraid of gunshots,
　　Not afraid of cannons booming,
　　We will crush the enemy's siege!

　　Gunshots ring,
　　Cannons boom,
　　The brutal enemy comes to attack!
　　Not afraid of gunshots,
　　Not afraid of cannons booming,
　　We will wipe out the enemy in central Hebei!
　　……
　　At night, the moon hung in the sky, and the ice shone with a bluish light. The commando team took turns setting out to this village and that village to harass the enemy. The comrades who stayed behind padded the ice with reed leaves, laid out straw mats, and slept on the ice; the men in one pile, the women in one pile, three or four people sharing a quilt. Human flesh is warm, and as they slept, the ice melted, and the ground underneath them was wet. Xiaomei laughed and said, "You have to be careful when you roll over, the ice has been thinned by the meat, don't let us leak into the Crystal Palace!" Dashui laughed and said, "Stop joking! This ice is so thick, you could bring a stove here, and it wouldn't leak." Everyone squeezed together and laughed wildly.

　　After sleeping on the ice for a few days, everyone's eyebrows and eyes were swollen, some had back pain, some had leg pain, and the female comrades all had stomach pain...But everyone was laughing and giggling, and no one complained.

　　One night, it snowed. The wind howled, and snowflakes fluttered wildly. In a short while, the snow buried them. The comrades were covered with straw mats and couldn't sleep because they were so cold. The men and women began to sing the "Youth March" in low voices:

　　Forward!
　　Chinese youth!
　　Advance!
　　Chinese youth!
　　China is like
　　A broken ship in a storm,
　　We must recognize
　　The danger of today;
　　Strive for victory
　　Tomorrow with all our strength!……　(To be continued)

　　新儿女英雄传
  　第十回　睡冰
  　在困难中不动摇！
    ——毛主席的话
    一
    张金龙刚挥起刀，后面有人喊过来：“喂！喂！慢着慢着！”张金龙回头一看，几个人跑到跟前来说：“大队长叫你先别砍，赶紧回去！”牛大水已经昏过去了，这时候迷迷糊糊的想：“我不是死啦？怎么脑袋不掉下来呢？”晕晕腾腾的觉得有人架着他走。一会儿，回到何家大宅，又给关到后院的小屋里了。
    张金龙心里纳闷，提着大刀片子，进了何世雄住的北屋，看见屋里坐着大太太，老太爷……好些个人，都在啼哭；何世雄一脸气恼，正在和一个护兵发脾气。张金龙也不敢问，坐在一边听听，才明白是何狗皮从镇上回来，半路给刘双喜他们劫走了；放护兵回来送信，要用何狗皮换牛大水。约定了地点，限明天交人，要不送回牛大水，撕了他狗皮，还要报仇。
    大水在小屋里醒过来，摸摸身上，这儿也是血，那儿也是血。披着的血衣裳已经沾住了，脱也脱不下。浑身痛得象乱刀子割，比上刑的时候还受不了啊！坐也不能坐，躺也不能躺，侧着身子，脑袋靠着墙根，一肚子委屈，哭开了。
    他心里想：“唉，我牛大水怎么落到这个地步啦！要不是出来工作，得罪下人，还会受这么大的罪啊！我这是下了十八层地狱了，叫天天不应，叫地地不灵，有谁知道我的苦哟！”他想尿尿，可是短裤衩跟血肉结成一块了；动一动就痛得要命，只好尿在裤子里了。尿螫着伤口，越发痛得慌。大水实在熬不过啦。
    他哭着想：“我的娘啊！这怎么受得了呀？倒不如干脆死了好。一死，什么痛，什么苦，都不觉得啦！”他真想死，可怎么死呢？他胡乱八七的想了许多寻死的办法，都不行，只能够一头撞死。
    大水勉强睁开一只眼儿瞧瞧。屋里很暗，外面可明了。几只家雀在窗棂上啄呢，啄啄又拍拍翅膀飞走了。大水不知怎么就想起黑老蔡，想起杨小梅，想起许多同志们；可不知他们都在哪儿，一定还在坚持哩。他就想到那一天，大伙儿举起胳膊宣誓：“再怎么困难也不悲观动摇！”大水想：“吓，我刚才想些什么来着？我是个共产党员，我他妈的还不抵个群众啊？老百姓还坚持抗日哩，我受了点刑，就想寻死，呸！我真他妈的糊涂！”气一壮，心一横，觉得痛也不那厉害了。
    大水想想他的娘——王大妈，想想尹大伯，想想许多老乡亲；昌着危险，费尽心机搭救他，他自个儿可想寻死；吓吓，这倒对得起人啊？他靠在墙上，自己也觉得好笑：“不出来工作，就能逃得过吗？老百姓死的还多呢，这埋怨谁去！都是鬼子汉奸那些王八蛋操的害人。他妈的，我牛大水不死啦！只要能活着，就得报仇！”
    二
    大水醒一阵，昏一阵，迷迷忽忽过了一天。晚上，他又醒过来，觉得晃晃荡荡的，听见打棹的声音，心里想：“莫非我在船上吗？该不是把我扔到河里淹死呀？”他想坐起来看看，可是浑身没一点劲儿，头也抬不起来，一下又糊涂过去了。
    船到了一片苇塘旁边，濠里咿咿哑哑出来一条小船。船头上坐着一位老先生，月光照着他雪白的长胡子，银亮亮的。他神清眼明的望着大船招招手，两只船靠拢了。他过这边大船上来，跟何世雄的父亲见面，两个人拱手让坐。
    船上那些伪军，都把手里的枪放了下来。梁广庭老先生说：“那边找我当个中人，牛大水来了没有？”何世雄的父亲指给他，老先生掀开破被子，吃了一惊。他摸了摸大水的心口，慢慢放下被子，搭拉着眼皮不说一句话了。
    那姓何的老家伙忙跟老先生解释，把打坏牛大水的责任，完全推在日本人身上；又说要把何狗皮送来了，才能放牛大水回去。梁老先生叹气说：“唉，太翁，这事儿我怕办不了！要说你们的少爷，我见来着，人家连一根汗毛也没动！将心比心是一个理儿。人成了这样子，这可怎么说？咱们也不能一手遮天，一手盖地啊！那边的意思，原是先把牛大水接回去，再送你们少爷过来。你要不乐意，我就越发难以为力了。两个人谈了半天，还是老先生担保，先把牛大水送过去。
    大水给裹在破被子里，抬上小船。小船又咿咿哑哑的钻了濠，在苇塘里这么一拐，那么一弯，走了半天，来到另一片苇塘。划船的打了一声口哨，苇丛里立时钻出两条小船，船上高屯儿双喜牛小水，都抢着跳到这边船上来。
    他们一看见大水打成这个模样儿，都楞住了。高屯儿牙齿咬得格铮铮的说：“这还行啊？他们把咱们的人打得死不死、活不活的，咱们可不能白白饶了这狗皮！”双喜忙说：“这笔帐以后再跟他们算，现在人已经回来了，可别叫老先生为难。”没想到小水这孩子擦了眼泪，一句话不说，早跳回那边船上去，拔出刀子，把何狗皮的鼻子嚓的一刀割下了，何狗皮戴着“梧眼”，连喊饶命。牛小水举起刀子，说：“再他妈的喊。一刀宰了你！”双喜忙跳过去把他拉开，说：“别乱搞！这么着解决不了问题。”小水还恨恨的骂着，把刀上的血在鞋底上抹了抹，插进套子里。一伙人把大水抬过这边船上，老先生赶忙把何狗皮送走了。
    半夜里，两只小船儿划到淀里一个小村，这村只有三十几户人家，四面全是水。小梅她们也早来到这儿，都眼巴巴的等大水回来呢。房东大嫂子早拾掇好一个炕，烧了一锅开水等着。人们把大水抬进来，杨小梅一看见，不由得一阵心酸，望着他含了两泡眼泪。他们把大水轻轻儿放在炕上，拿灯照着，一揭开破被子，围着他的同志们全哭下了。
    大水——大水——本来那么壮的好小伙子，这会儿糟害成什么样儿了呀！脑袋肿得跟大头翁似的，狗咬的伤口都出了蛆，十个指头给钉子钉得从胳膊肘儿以下全乌紫了，浑身还哪儿瞧得见一块好肉啊！他昏迷着昏迷着，只剩下一丝儿气了。
    从县大队找来的卫生员，给大水打了一针，大水醒过来了。他睁开左眼，看着双喜，又看看小梅，又看看高屯儿，看着看着，猛一挺就坐起来，喊：“怎么？是你们啊！”小梅忙扶住他，哭着说：“大水啊，你回来啦，你……不碍事啦！”大水浮肿的脸儿露出笑模样了：“我回来啦，我回来啦，我可是见着你们啦！哈哈哈！哈哈哈！……”他不住的笑，他不住的说胡话，他疯了。
    他疯了，同志们的心儿给什么咬住了似的，都忍不住哭出声来了。
    三
    秋天，旱地上到处都是敌人。五里一个大岗楼，三里一个小岗楼。到后来，白洋淀里也有敌人了，大村都修了岗楼，小村也常去。敌人征的出赋，预借的食粮，吃不尽，天天香油白面，猪肉鸡子儿……老百姓吃草籽、榆树皮、酸里苗、红薯叶儿……有的挖野菜，挖着挖着就饿死了。环境真残酷，真艰苦啊！
    程平黑老蔡他们还在旱地上坚持。刘双喜一伙分配在西部白洋淀。他们掌握村干部，联系群众，跟敌人作斗争。
    牛大水病了好长一个时期，全靠老乡亲尽心的照顾，同志们轮流的伺候。在那艰苦的环境里，不能不常常转移。老乡们有时把大水藏在洞里，有时藏在船上，有时用“小排子”把他藏在苇塘里。大水的病慢慢的好起来；大秋以后，伤也好得差不多了，只是身体很虚弱。
    冬天，白洋淀冻冰了。太阳照在冰上，四下里亮晶晶的，冰上反映着天空的蓝色。鬼子坐着老百姓的冰床，一长溜，一长溜，飞快的在冰上跑，到各村搜索。他们明知道有“八路”活动，可怎么也抓不住。
    后来，敌人的“讨伐大队”从旱地上转游过来了。一时，这一带大大小小的村子，都住下了鬼子；搜查、翻腾、拷问老百姓……双喜他们和一些太“红”的村干部，都在老百姓的掩护下撤出来，隐蔽在白洋淀的苇塘里。这一年，白洋淀的苇塘，全留了“边苇”——老百姓把里面的苇子割了，四周围留下一圈苇子，好掩护八路军。
    一连好几天，双喜他们都在苇塘里的冰上过日子。饿了，把老百姓偷偷送来的麻饼、棉籽团儿、野菜搀的糠窝窝…杂七杂八的冷东西，分着吃；渴了就嚼冰凌子。双喜说笑话：“这是冰糖哪！一人一块，不花钱。”大家咯吱吱，咯吱吱的，嚼得怪起劲。送来了地梨面的饽饽，就给大水吃。大水脑瓜儿上箍着白布，仰躺在高屯儿怀里。他很过意不去：“我的伤已经好了，凭什么该吃好东西呀？”拿个饽饽让来让去，临了还是吃半个，那半个一人抉一小块儿，分的吃了。小梅穿着老百姓给她的破棉裤，膝盖儿上吊着一块破布，西北风吹着，破布儿一掀一掀的。秀女儿说她：“哈！你这个裤子上还吊个门帘儿呢！”小梅也忍不住笑起来，说：“你这调皮鬼，别出我的洋相啦！”
    太阳射在冰上，刺得人眼睛痛。人们成堆的坐着，有时候开讨论会，有时候擦枪；擦着擦着，就唱起歌来：
    枪声响，
    大炮轰，
    残暴的敌人来围攻！
    不怕枪响，
    不怕炮轰，
    我们要粉碎敌人的围
    攻！
　
    枪声响，
    大炮轰，
    残暴的敌人来进攻！
    不怕枪响，
    不怕炮轰，
    把敌人消灭在冀中！
    ……
    晚上，月亮挂在天空，冰上闪着青幽幽的光。突击队轮流出发这村那村，去骚扰敌人。留下来的同志，在冰上垫着苇叶子，铺着席，就在冰上睡；男同志一摊，女同志一摊，三四个人盖一条被子。人肉是热的啊，睡着睡着，冰就化了，身子底下水济济的。小梅笑着说：“你们翻身打滚，可得小心点儿啊，冰给肉吸得薄了，别把咱们漏到水晶宫里去哟！”那边大水笑着说：“别打牙玩啦！这么厚的冰，搬个火炉子来，也漏不下去。”大家挤着乱笑。
    在冰上睡了几天，每一个人眉眼儿都浮肿了，有的腰痛，有的腿痛，女同志都闹肚子痛……可是，谁都嘻嘻哈哈的，没有一个人叫苦。
    一天夜里，下雪了。风呜呜叫，雪花儿乱飘。一阵工夫，雪就把他们埋住了。同志们蒙着席子，冻得睡不着。男的，女的，就低声儿唱起“青年进行曲”：
    前进！
    中国的青年！
    挺战！
    中国的青年！
    中国恰象
    暴风雨中的破船，
    我们要认识
    今日的危险；
    向一切力量
    争取胜利的明天！……　（未完）
