    Xinhua News Agency, Beiping, 22nd. An "AP Financial Weekly" report published on the 18th reveals that the U.S. economy is further deteriorating. It is reported that industrial production declined again this week, steel production fell for the ninth consecutive week, unemployment figures rose, and labor problems are tense. The selling wave on the stock exchange earlier this week pushed stock prices to their lowest point in four and a half years, which made Wall Street tremble. The Department of Agriculture expects agricultural income in the Midwest to fall by 10% in the first half of this year compared to last year. Agricultural income in the first four months of this year was lower than at the beginning of 1948 (the price of grain in the United States fell sharply last year, reducing farmers' income by 4.4 billion U.S. dollars, and the annual income was about 20 billion U.S. dollars). Prices did not fail to fall this week. Metal goods continue to change to reduced prices, and the prices of packaging and bags have also fallen slightly. Tire prices have been reduced, and some people believe that car prices will also be reduced again (cars are currently the only industry in the United States that is barely maintaining current production amid widespread production cuts).

    美经济进一步恶化
    华尔街为之战栗了
    【新华社北平二十二日电】美联社十八日发表的“一周金融”，透露美国经济进一步恶化。据称：该周工业生产再度下降，钢铁生产连续第九周的下落，失业数字上升，劳工问题紧张。本周初证券交易所抛卖浪潮，使股票价格降到四年半以来的最低点，这曾使华尔街为之战栗。农业部预料中西部各州农业收入今年上半年将较去年下跌百分之十，今年头四个月农业收入比一九四八年初为低（按去年美国粮价大跌，农民收入减少四十四亿美元，全年收入约二百亿美元）。这个星期物价并不是没有下跌。金属物品继续换上减价的价标，包装和袋子价钱也稍跌，车胎减价，有些人相信汽车也将再度减价（按汽车是目前美国工业普遍减产中勉强维持目前生产的工业）。
