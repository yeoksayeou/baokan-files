　　Executive Committee Elected Through Labor-Management Contract
  　Founding of Pingguo Pharmaceutical Union
    [This newspaper dispatch] After two days of heated discussions and research, the National Pharmaceutical Industry Workers' Representative Assembly revised and passed the draft labor-management contract proposed by the labor side, and the draft charter of the Beiping National Pharmaceutical Industry Workers' Union. It also studied the draft labor-management contract proposed by the capital side, and elected 15 executive committee members of the city's National Pharmaceutical Industry Workers' Union, including Wang Jinzhang and Lian Shengxue, and three alternate executive committee members. The executive committee members nominated seven standing committee members, including Wang Jinzhang, and discussed the work plan for the next six months. The conference concluded successfully last night. The draft charter of the city's National Pharmaceutical Industry Workers' Union consists of six chapters and seventeen articles. The charter contains detailed provisions on the union's purpose, members' rights and obligations, organizational leadership, discipline, funding, and other issues. After several revisions, the conference representatives unanimously approved it after discussing and revising it article by article. Regarding the draft labor-management contract, the rights and obligations, employment, dismissal, resignation, wages and living standards, working hours and holidays, welfare matters, and other items proposed by both labor and capital sides are generally the same, but there are some differences in the specific provisions of the content. In the spirit of benefiting both labor and capital and developing production, the two sides should not find it difficult to resolve. After discussion, it was decided that the work plan for the next six months will focus on formulating draft labor-management contracts for each company, initially adjusting scores, and improving the organization in the first three months, and on production and strengthening learning leadership in the last three months.

　　通过劳资合同选出执委
  　平国药业工会成立
    【本报讯】国药业职工代表大会经过两天的热烈讨论、研究，修正并通过了劳方所提出之劳资合同草案，及北平市国药业职工会章程草案，并研究了资方所提出之劳资合同草案，选举了市的国药业职工会执行委员王锦章、连升学等十五人，候补执委三人，各执委推出王锦章等七人为常委，讨论了今后的半年工作计划。大会昨晚胜利闭幕。市的国药业职工会章程草案共分六章十七条，该会之宗旨、会员权利与义务、组织领导、纪律、经费等问题均有详细的条文规定，先后数次修改，大会代表逐条讨论修改后一致通过。关于劳资合同草案，劳资双方所提出的，其权利义务、雇用解雇与辞退、工资与生活待遇、工作时间与假期、福利事项等项目大体相同，而其内容之具体规定则有些出入。双方本劳资两利发展生产的精神，当不难解决。半年的工作计划，经讨论决定，前三月以制订各家劳资合同草案及初步调整分数、健全组织为主，后三月以生产为主，加强学习领导。
