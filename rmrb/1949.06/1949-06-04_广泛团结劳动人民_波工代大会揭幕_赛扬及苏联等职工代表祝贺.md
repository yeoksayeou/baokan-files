　　Broadly Unite the Working People
  　Polish Labor Congress Opens
  　Saillant and Soviet Union and Other Trade Union Representatives Offer Congratulations
    [Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 3rd] Warsaw, Polish News Agency: At the opening session of the Polish Trade Union Congress on June 1st, a presidium was elected, as well as working committees for credentials, guidance, labor emulation, social affairs, economy, constitution, culture, teaching, drafting, and elections. Subsequently, President Bierut and foreign guests delivered speeches.
    Speeches by Polish President Bierut and Premier Cyrankiewicz were met with enthusiastic applause. Bierut said: The congress is a manifestation of the broadest unity of the Polish working people, and he hoped the congress would succeed in further consolidating the trade unions, enhancing their role in the life and development of Poland, and accelerating Poland's progress towards a happy future.
    World Federation of Trade Unions (WFTU) General Secretary Saillant spoke on behalf of the WFTU. He said: The current international situation requires strengthening the solidarity and mutual assistance of working people around the world. The invitation of the WFTU to participate in the Polish Trade Union Congress should be considered a manifestation of the internationalism of the Polish trade union movement. Saillant concluded: When we personally witness the victories achieved by the Soviet working masses in implementing their Five-Year Plan, we look forward with confidence. Working people all over the world want peace. There can be no peace unless there is a permanent, friendly relationship between all trade union organizations. The congress provides new proof of this.
    The head of the Soviet delegation, Secretary of the All-Union Central Council of Trade Unions, Goroshkin, said in his address: The Soviet working masses closely follow the work of the Polish people and sincerely wish them success. The Soviet people are engaged in peaceful, creative work and are concerned about lasting peace. The friendship between the Soviet Union and People's Poland is growing and consolidating. Goroshkin's speech sparked cheers for Stalin throughout the hall. The speech by the Chinese representative, Qian Junrui, was welcomed by all the representatives. General Secretary of the French General Confederation of Labor (CGT), Frachon, said in his address: In Poland, the working class plays a leading role in the country's economic and political life, while we French workers have to fight against state institutions that serve only capitalism. Our workers understand this difference, so they welcome every one of your achievements as a victory for the entire working class.
    Frachon pointed out that the American and French reactionaries, together with right-wing trade union leaders led by Jouhaux, are trying to isolate the French CGT, but they have isolated themselves, while the CGT still maintains its strength. Frachon concluded: "French workers will never fight against you; only French capitalists are your enemies."
    In the afternoon, Chairman of the Czechoslovak Trade Union, Zápotocký, conveyed to the congress the congratulatory telegram from three million members of the Czechoslovak Trade Union. The representatives responded with prolonged applause. The telegram said: The people of various people's democratic countries are being linked by increasingly strong bonds of international solidarity. The Polish and Czechoslovak trade unions are developing socialist labor emulation with common experience, which is the result of the workers' socialist attitude towards work. Cooperation between the national central agencies of the two countries' trade unions will encompass various aspects of activity, primarily social and political affairs, newspapers, culture, workers' education, and publishing.
    At this point, Secretary of the Polish Trade Union Central Committee, Zawadzki, elaborated on "The Role of Trade Unions in the Polish People's Democratic System." He declared that the congress would make resolutions based on the decisions of the Polish United Workers' Party and the experience of the victorious socialist countries.
    The congress welcomed General Secretary of the Italian General Confederation of Labor (CGIL), Bitossi, and General Secretary of the Italian Transport Workers' Union, Antonucelli. Next, Hungarian Trade Union representative Gáz represented 1.5 million Hungarian Trade Union members in conveying congratulations to the congress.

　　广泛团结劳动人民
  　波工代大会揭幕
  　赛扬及苏联等职工代表祝贺
    【新华社北平三日电】波兰通讯社华沙讯：六月一日，波兰职工会代表大会开幕会上，选出主席团，和资格审查、指导、劳动竞赛、社会、经济、章程、文化、教学、起草与选举等工作委员会。接着总统贝鲁特和外国来宾相继讲话。
    波总统贝鲁特、总理西伦凯维兹的演说博得热烈鼓掌。贝鲁特说：大会是波兰劳动人民最广泛的团结的表现，希望大会在进一步巩固职工会，在提高职工会在波兰生活与发展的作用，在使波兰加速向幸福的将来迈进等方面的成功。
    世界工联总书记赛扬代表世界工联讲话。他说：现阶段国际情势要求加强全世界劳动人民的团结互助。世界工联之被邀参加波兰职工会代表大会，应该认为是波兰职工运动国际主义的表现。赛扬在结语中说：当我们亲眼看见苏联劳动群众在实行其五年计划中所获得的胜利的时候，我们满怀信心地展望着前途。全世界劳动群众都要和平。除非一切职工组织间存在着永久的友好的关系，否则便不可能有和平。大会在这点上提供了新的证明。
    苏联代表团团长全苏职工会中央委员会书记哥罗席金致词说：苏联劳动群众密切注视着波兰人民的工作，并衷心期望他们成功。苏联人民正从事于和平的创造性的工作，并关切持久和平。苏联与人民波兰间的友谊正在增长和巩固中。哥罗席金的演说，掀起了全场对斯大林的欢呼。中国代表钱俊瑞的演词受到全体代表的欢迎。法国总工会总书记佛拉商致词说：在波兰，工人阶级在国家的经济与政治生活中起着领导作用，而我们法国工人却不得不为反对专门为资本主义服务的国家机构而斗争。我国工人懂得这种不同，所以欢迎你们的每一个成就，把它看作整个工人阶级的胜利。
    佛拉商指出美法反动派和以石屋为首的右翼职工领袖在一起，想孤立法国总工会，但是他们却孤立了自己，而总工会仍然保持了它的力量。佛拉商结语称：“法国工人永久不会对你们作战；只有法国的资本家才是你们的敌人。”
    下午，捷克斯洛伐克职工会主席西波罗向大会转达捷克斯洛伐克三百万职工会会员的贺电。代表们报之以长时间的鼓掌。贺电中说：各人民民主国家的人民正为越来越强大的国际团结的纽带所联结着。波捷两国职工会正以共同的经验来开展社会主义劳动竞赛，这种竞赛是工人们对工作采取社会主义态度的结果。两国职工会全国性的中央机构之间的合作，将包罗各种方面的活动，首先是社会与政治、报纸、文化、工人教育与出版等方面的活动。
    至此，波兰职工会中央委员会书记查瓦得兹基论述“职工会在波兰人民民主制度中的作用”。他声称，代表大会将根据波兰统一工人党的决定及胜利的社会主义国家的经验作出决议。
    大会欢迎意总工会书记比托西及意运输工人工会总书记安东尼西。接着，匈牙利职工会代表加兹代表匈牙利一百五十万职工会会员向大会致贺。
