Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 28th—The People's Liberation Army garrisoning Shanghai, in order to support the people of Shanghai in their economic struggle against saboteurs and speculators, cooperated with students and workers in conducting large-scale anti-silver dollar speculation propaganda earlier this month. Beforehand, all units carried out widespread and thorough mobilization and education. Guo Huaruo, political commissar of the garrison command, called on the entire army at a cadres meeting: "We must support the people of Shanghai's struggle against silver dollar speculation with a fighting posture and win a great victory in the economic field!" After the propaganda movement began, the political commissars and directors of the political departments of each regiment personally led propaganda teams to carry out propaganda. On the 11th and 12th, the PLA in the city dispatched more than 40 propaganda teams and 100 propaganda trucks, accompanied by military music, singing, and costume performances, to conduct propaganda on major streets and screened slides in various entertainment venues. Many people who listened to the speeches enthusiastically sang songs and shouted slogans with the PLA, and some jumped onto trucks to give speeches to everyone. Wei Laiguo, a shooting hero of East China and representative to the World Democratic Youth Congress, gave a speech to the citizens, saying: "The suffering of the people is our suffering. We guarantee to resolutely eliminate special agents and unscrupulous merchants who manipulate speculation, just like eliminating enemies on the battlefield, and eliminate harm for the people!" A citizen who listened to his speech said very satisfied: "With the help of the PLA, things will definitely be easy!" The propaganda teams of the army and students often met together, cheering each other and cooperating with each other in their work. When a propaganda team from a certain unit of the PLA met a joint propaganda team from the China Industrial and Commercial School and the Cunde Middle School on Jianguo Road, the two sides merged and moved forward together, with the PLA beating gongs and drums and the students performing the Yangko dance.

　　警卫上海解放军
  　参加反银元投机宣传
    【新华社上海二十八日电】警备上海的人民解放军，为支持上海人民对破坏分子和投机商人的经济斗争，曾于本月上旬配合学生和职工进行大规模的反银元投机宣传。各部事先都进行了普遍深入的动员和教育，警备司令部政治委员郭化若在干部会上号召全军：“要以战斗的姿态，支持上海人民反银元投机的斗争，在经济上打大胜仗！”宣传运动开始后，各团的政治委员和政治处主任亲率宣传队出发宣传。在十一、十二两日，全市的解放军共出动了四十余个宣传队和一百辆宣传卡车，配着军乐、唱歌、化装表演等在各主要街道进行宣传，在各娱乐场所放映幻灯片。许多倾听演讲的群众兴奋地与解放军一起唱歌，高呼口号，有的就跳上卡车向大家演说。华东射击英雄出席世界民主青年大会代表魏来国向市民讲演说：“人民的痛苦就是我们的痛苦，我们保证象消灭战场上的敌人一样坚决地肃清操纵投机的特务奸商，为人民除害！”听他讲演的一个市民非常满意地说：“有解放军帮助，事情一定好办！”军队和学生的宣传队常常相遇一起，互相欢呼，并互相配合进行工作。当解放军某部的宣传队与中华工商学校和存德中学的联合宣传队在建国路相遇时，双方就汇合在一起前进，解放军打着锣鼓，学生们扭着秧歌。
