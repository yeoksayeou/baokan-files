Michalowski, the secretary of the Executive Committee of the party, reported on the contributions of the peasant youth, saying that the rural organization of the Polish Youth League has expanded by 50% in the past three months. Young peasants are enthusiastically acquiring technical knowledge and culture, and are more eager for progress than the older generation. Korczisz, the general secretary of the party, spoke at the closing meeting about the struggle against counter-revolutionary elements in the peasant movement, and pointed out that the unification of the Peasant Party and the Polish Peasant Party will greatly strengthen the peasant movement and increase its importance in the country.
