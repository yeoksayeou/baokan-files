Sixth Episode: Water Heroes

　　The enemy's small steamer,
　　Running up and down with glee,
　　He put the guerrillas,
　　Out of his memory,
　　Ai-hey-yo,
　　De-leng-deng-sheng,
　　Out of his memory.

　　The steamer is coming,
　　The brothers are delighted,
　　The captain flips his box,
　　The monkey falls into the water,
　　Ai-hey-yo,
　　De-leng-deng-sheng,
　　The monkey falls into the water.
　　　　　——Folk song
　一
　　Uncle Big Water suffered that misfortune and nearly went crazy, lying in bed for several months, unable to get up. Old Mother Gao of Gao Village, that day she sat in the colorful sedan, the Japanese soldiers thought it was a bride, pulled her out and saw that it was an old woman with a face full of wrinkles. The devils laughed strangely, picked up their rifle butts, and slammed her several times, breaking her waist.
　　That time, the enemy occupied Xieliu Village and built blockhouses. After the blockhouses were built, Squad Leader Iino and Guo San Mazi, led the Japanese and puppet troops, stationed there, and often came to harass this side. Big Water and Gao Village led the guerrillas and fought them several times, and later they made them suffer a solid loss. The devils retreated to the town, leaving Guo San Mazi and his gang, who dared not easily come over again. But Big Water and the others could do nothing about the blockhouses.
　　It was getting cold. Little Mei, holding her child Little Thin, went home to get cotton clothes; Little Thin had just been weaned, and Little Mei planned to send him home; and to see Big Water, also bringing him something. But Big Water had gone to Shen Yaozong's house.
　　Since Shen Yaozong went to the city, he had spent a lot of money, and often missed his family. After the "Double Ten" Administrative Program was promulgated here, Hei Lao Cai sent him a copy, with a letter asking him to come back. Shen Yaozong read this Administrative Program over and over again, and thought about it for several days. He felt that the Communist Party was really talking about unity, implementing a united front, specifically to deal with devils and traitors; it was a bit silly to leave his family business and wander outside. Seeing that other landlords returned home and were safe and sound, he made up his mind to quietly return. Big Water studied the Party's policies, and when he heard that he had returned, he went to see him and promoted Chairman Mao's ideas.
　　Little Mei waited in the commune office. The commune office was quiet. Only the children in the courtyard next door were singing:
　　Everyone come and listen,
　　Hey, everyone come and see:
　　Look at the Communist Party's proposed
　　--Double Ten Program Twenty Articles!
　　For our border region's people,
　　Want freedom, want happiness,
　　Protect our homeland, kill the enemy,
　　--Everyone unite firmly
　　Twenty articles,
　　Hey! Twenty articles!
　　Like a fast knife,
　　Aimed at the Japanese fascist bandit
　　Gang,
　　--One cut and they can't run
　　away.………
　　Little Mei listened, a slight smile on her face.
　　Suddenly Big Water returned looking worried.
　　二
　　Little Mei smiled and asked Big Water, "What's wrong? Did you run into a snag at work?" Big Water sighed, hung his satchel on the wall, sat down, and said nothing. Little Mei asked, "I heard you went to Shen Yaozong's place, did he give you a hard time?" Big Water said, "Shen Yaozong came back and saw that nothing in his house had been moved, he was quite happy, nothing." Little Mei said, "Then what are you unhappy about?" Big Water lowered his head and said nothing.
　　Little Mei couldn't guess what was going on, and said with a smile, "We've worked together for several years, I'm not an outsider, it wouldn't hurt to tell me!" Big Water glanced at her and said, "It's about my wife." Little Mei then persuaded him, "Big Water, you're so young, aren't you afraid you won't find someone? What's there to worry about!" Big Water anxiously said, "Look where you're going! I'm not worried, it doesn't matter if I'm a bachelor for the rest of my life, it's just my dad... he can't let go of my marriage. Last time he got half-crazy with anxiety, and he didn't get better after getting sick, I went back to see him, he kept crying, and pulled me to say... say..." Big Water didn't go on. Little Mei asked, "Say what? Why do you say half a sentence and swallow half a sentence!" Big Water said, "Alas! He said his life was too bitter, the first time he arranged a marriage it was with you, and there was a big fuss, who knew that the willow tree would blossom but bear no fruit. This time he arranged for Cuihua, and it looked like she was about to cross the threshold, but then a disaster struck... He keeps thinking about it, it's become a disease in his heart, and sometimes he gets confused... I think he won't live long!"
　　Little Mei listened, staring blankly at Big Water, the child in her arms was making noise, pulling her hair, she didn't even notice. Big Water asked her, "When did you come?" Little Mei couldn't answer for a moment, her face flushed red, and she asked shyly, "What did you say?... The county is going to arrange elections soon... I came to tell you..."
　　The two of them chatted for a while. Little Mei then took out a pair of new shoes from her bundle and said, "Big Water, you're running around; look at your shoes, with a big tiger's mouth, it's too unseemly! I don't have a shoe pattern, try them on and see if they fit." Big Water put on the new shoes, grinning and laughing, "Hey, pretty good! Just the right size. This is too much trouble for you..." Little Mei looked at him with watery eyes, smiling with concern, "Big Water, don't say that. What's this! In the future, if you have any rough work, just give it to me, I'll try to steal some time to help you with it."
　　It was getting dark. Little Mei left with the child in her arms.
　　三
　　This year's five-level general election was quite lively. Men and women of all classes participated, even Shen Yaozong and those people voted, everyone could choose whoever they liked. The people chose good people to do things for them; from village to district to county... all the way up to the highest administrative organ of the border region, they chose a neat group. The regime implemented the "three-thirds system," with Communist Party members only accounting for one-third. Our Hei Lao Cai was also elected to the county. Big Water and Little Mei were also elected as district representatives. Little Mei became the Women's Director in the district; Big Water became the captain in the district. At this time, the district's guerrilla team had been renamed the district squad.
　　Big Water, as the captain in the district, had a larger scope of activities. Part of this district was in Baiyang Lake. On the other side of the lake, there was a town called Da Diankou. In the spring, Da Diankou was occupied by the enemy. The devils there often contacted the devils in the town here, and steamers came and went. The fish caught by the people, the ducks raised... were often robbed by them; merchant ships also dared not travel.
　　One day, Big Water gathered his team members to study, wanting to deal with that steamer. His brother Little Water, who was sixteen years old, had recently joined the district squad, and when he heard that they were going to attack the steamer, he was secretly delighted, and suddenly thought of a way, and hurriedly shouted, "Brother! I have a good idea!" Big Water said with a serious face, "This is a meeting, no brothering!" Everyone laughed.
　　Little Water stuck out his tongue and said, "If I'm not allowed to call you brother, I'll report to the chairman, I have an opinion." Big Water said, "Okay, speak. This is work, don't mess around!" Little Water said, "Of course I'm not messing around. I'm thinking: a big gun costs one bullet per shot, and if you don't hit it, it's over; I have an idea, just use our fire guns to hit that bastard. As long as you're close, one shot will hit a large area, and you're sure to make him feed the turtles! --That's the end of my opinion!"
　　Some team members laughed and said, "Wow, this idea is pretty good!" Zhao Wugeng, who had fought in the ten-year water siege, said, "I think if we're going to use fire guns, we might as well get dozens of them, and shoot all at once, he won't be able to run!" Ma Dan said, "I'm afraid that won't work! Can the crude guns still work?" Big Water thought for a moment and said, "I think this method is not bad, let's try it, and then use pistols and big guns to cooperate." After discussing for a while, they decided.
　　This day, the steamer passed by again, guessing that it would return to Da Diankou in the afternoon, Big Water and the others rowed twenty small boats -- all "gun rafts" for shooting ducks and chickens, set off. The boats were very light, and in Baiyang Lake, one followed the other, rowing quickly. The oars on both sides of the boat went up and down, like geese flapping their wings in the sky. Before long, they rushed to a large reed marsh.
　　In May, the reed shoots on the water surface were more than a person tall. This reed marsh was several miles around, with ditches running horizontally and vertically; a long string of small boats drilled into it, and not one was seen. The enemy's steamer had to pass in front of the reed marsh when it returned. They deployed on the edge of the reed marsh, and the boats were hidden in the reeds. Each boat had two fire guns, with the gun heads padded high and low, loaded with gunpowder, lit with fire incense, and waited quietly.
　　The sun was setting. They could hear the steamer whistling in the west. Big Water said, "Here it comes! Get ready!" Everyone held fire incense in their hands, peering out from the reeds. As soon as a green small steamer arrived, Big Water shouted "Fire!" the fuses were lit, and dozens of crude guns fired out all at once with a booming sound, like landmines, darkening the sky with smoke. They couldn't see how it was hit clearly, only hearing the steamer sputter. Little Water said in a low voice, "It's really weird! What's going on? Are people dead or not? Not returning fire, and not sailing away!" Big Water said, "Don't make noise! Look!"
　　The smoke cleared, and they could see that there was no one on the steamer, and the steamer was spinning on the water. Zhao Wugeng hurriedly said, "I'll go check it out!" He took Little Water's knife, jumped into the water, and dove over. The steamer suddenly started again. The small boats in the reeds drilled out, and everyone was anxious to fire. But Zhao Wugeng's head emerged from next to the steamer. Wugeng's thin body was dripping with water, quietly clinging to the side of the boat, looking inside, and saw a Japanese devil crawling on the stern of the boat aiming a gun. He quickly flipped into the boat, the devil turned his head, and the sharp knife had already been inserted into the devil's back, and with another knife, he was dead.
　　Inside the steamer, there were several corpses lying askew. But the boat was still sputtering forward, getting faster and faster. Anxious, Zhao Wugeng groped around, but couldn't do anything with that machine, and hurriedly stood up, waving his hand to the back and shouting, "Come quickly! I can't handle this thing, don't let it run away!" Immediately, twenty small boats rowed like a race, splashing, all coming to catch the steamer. The steamer ran even faster, unable to catch up. Anxious, Zhao Wugeng frantically went to pull the machine again, failed, stood up again, waving his hands and shouting, "Hurry up! Hurry up! Damn it! This thing...runs fast! You guys hurry up and use your strength!" The steamer charged straight, suddenly crashing into a reed field, still trying to drill inside; everyone chased up and stopped it.

   　第六回　水上英雄
　
    敌人的小汽船，
    上下跑了个欢，
    他把那游击队，
    忘在了一边，
    哎咳哟，
    德冷登生，
    忘在了一边。
　
    汽船儿来到了，
    弟兄们心喜欢，
    队长的盒子往上翻，
    猴儿打落水里边，
    哎咳哟，
    德冷登生，
    猴儿打落水里边。
    　　　　　——民歌
  　一
    大水爹遭了那一场横祸，差点儿疯了，躺了好几个月，下不来炕。高屯儿老娘，那天坐在彩轿里，日本兵以为是新娘子，拉出来一看，是个满脸皱纹的老太婆，鬼子怪声怪气的笑起来，拿起枪托子，狠狠顿了她几下，把她的腰都打坏啦。
    那次，敌人占了斜柳村，就修岗楼。楼修起了，饭野小队长和郭三麻子，带着鬼子和伪军，驻在那儿，经常到这边来骚扰。大水高屯儿带着游击队，跟他们打了好几回仗，后来又叫他们结结实实吃了一次亏。鬼子退回市镇去，留下郭三麻子一伙人，更不敢轻易过来了。可是，大水他们拿这岗楼也没办法。
    天冷了。小梅抱着孩子小瘦，回家去拿棉衣；小瘦刚断了奶，小梅准备送他回家；顺便来看看大水，还给他带了一样东西。可是大水到申耀宗家去了。
    申耀宗自从到城里以后，花销很大，又常结记他的家庭，这边双十施政纲领颁布以后，黑老蔡给他寄了一份，捎信叫他回来。申耀宗把这一份施政纲领看了一遍又一遍，心里琢磨了好几天。觉得共产党真是讲团结，实行统一战线，专门对付鬼子汉汗；自己丢下家业，飘流在外面，未免有点儿傻。又看见旁的地主回家，都平安无事，也就下了决心，悄悄的回来了。大水学习了党的政策，听说他回来，就去看望他，跟他宣传毛主席的主张。
    小梅在公所等着。公所里静悄悄的。只听见隔墙院子里，孩子们在唱：
    大家都来听，
    嘿，大家都来瞧：
    你看那共产党提出的
    ——双十纲领二十条！
    为了咱们边区老百姓，
    要自由，要幸福，
    保家乡，杀敌人，
    ——大家团结牢
    二十条，
    嘿！二十条！
    好象一把飞快刀，
    对准日本法西斯强
    盗，
    ——一刀砍去跑不
    了。………
    小梅听着，脸上微微的笑。
    忽然大水愁蹙蹙的回来了。
     二
    小梅笑着问大水“你怎么啦？工作上碰钉子啦？”大水叹了一口气，把挎包往墙上一挂，坐下来，话也不说。小梅问：“听说你到申耀宗那儿去了，是不是他给你气受啦？”大水说：“申耀宗回来，看见家里什么也没有动，他倒是挺高兴，没有什么。”小梅说：“那你有什么不痛快呢？”大水低着头，不言声。
    小梅猜不透是怎么回事儿，又笑着说：“咱俩一块儿工作了几年，我又不是外人，跟我说说也不碍啊！”大水对她看了一眼，说：“就为我那媳妇的事儿。”小梅就劝他：“大水，你年纪轻轻的，还怕找不下个对象？这有个什么愁的！”大水着急说：“你看你扯到哪儿去了！我倒不发愁，一辈子打光棍儿也不要紧，就是我爹…为了我的亲事，老放不下。上回他急了个半疯子，一病就不好，我回去看他，他老啼哭，拉着我说……说……”大水不说下去了。小梅问：“说什么呀？怎么你说半句咽半句的！”大水说：“唉！他说命太苦，头一回说亲说了个你，闹了一回子，谁知道柳树上开花，没结果。这一回说了个翠花儿，眼看要过门了，又飞来个横祸……他老念叨着，成了心里一块病，有时候就发迷糊……我看他活不长了！”
    小梅听了，呆呆的望着大水，怀里的孩子闹着，揪她的头发，她都不觉着。大水问她：“你什么时候来的？”小梅一时答不上，脸儿飞红了，不好意思的问：“你说什么？……最近县上就要布置选举了……我来告诉你……”
    两个人说了一阵闲话。小梅就从包袱里抽出一对新鞋来，说：“大水，你们东跑西颠的；看你的鞋，张着个大老虎嘴儿，太不象样啦！我也没个鞋样子，你穿穿看合适不合适。”大水穿上新鞋，咧开个大嘴笑着说：“咦，挺美！刚刚一脚。这就太叫你……”小梅眼睛水汪汪的瞧着他，心疼的笑着说：“大水，别说这个话。这算得了什么！往后你有什么粗细活儿，只管拿给我，我怎么着偷个空儿，也帮你作起来。”
    天黑了。小梅抱着孩子走了。
   　三
    这一年的五级大选举，搞得挺热闹。各阶层的男女都参加了，连申耀宗这些人也投了票，大家爱选谁就选谁。老百姓都挑选好样儿的，来给他们办事；从村到区到县……一直选到边区最高行政机关，可选了个齐整。政权实行了三三制，共产党员只占三分之一。咱们的黑老蔡也给选到县上去了。大水小梅也都是选出来的区代表。小梅在区上当妇女主任；大水在区上当了队长。这时候，区上的游击队，已经改名为区小队了。
    大水在区上当队长，活动范围更大了。这个区，一部分是在白洋淀里。淀的那边，有个镇子叫大淀口。春天，大淀口给敌人占领了。那儿的鬼子经常和这边市镇上的鬼子取联系，汽船来来往往的。老百姓打的鱼，养的鸭子……常给他们抢去；商船也不敢行走了。
    一天，大水集合队员们研究，想治治那汽船。他的兄弟小水，十六岁了，新近也参加了区小队，一听说要打汽船，心里乐得怪痒痒的，猛然间想起了一个办法，急忙喊：“哥！我可有个好主意！”大水一脸正经的说：“这是开会，什么哥不哥的！”众人都笑了。
    小水吐了吐舌头，说：“不准叫哥，我就报告主席，我有个意见。”大水说：“好，你说吧。这是工作，你可别闹着玩儿！”小水说：“当然不是闹着玩儿么。我这么寻思：大枪一枪一个子儿，打不准就完蛋啦；我出个主意，就使咱们的火枪打他兔崽子。只要离得近，一打就是一大片，准叫他喂王八！——我的意见完啦！”
    有些队员笑着说：“吓，这个主意倒使得！”打过十年水围的赵五更说：“我看咱们要使火枪，干脆弄上他妈的几十枝，说打一齐打，他没个跑！”马胆小说：“这怕不行！土枪还能顶事儿？”大水想了一下，说：“我看这个办法倒不错，咱们就这么试试看，再用手枪大枪配合着。”又商量了一阵，就决定了。
    这一天，汽船又过去了，估摸他下午回大淀口，大水他们划着二十只小船——都是打水鸭水鸡儿的“枪排子”，出发了。船很轻，在白洋淀里，一个跟着一个，飞快的划去。船两边的棹儿一上一下划，就象天上雁儿打翅膀。不多一会儿，就窜到一片大苇塘跟前啦。
    五月，水面上苇芽子一人多高了。这苇塘方圆好几里，里面横一条，竖一条，都是沟濠；一长串小船儿钻进去，一个也不见了。敌人的汽船要回去，准得从苇塘前面过。他们在苇塘边儿上布置开，船都隐在苇丛里。每一个船上两支火枪，枪头子高低都垫好，装上闷药，点上火香，悄悄儿等着。
    日头歪了。听得见西边汽船呜儿呜的叫。大水说：“来了！快准备好！”大伙儿手里都拿着火香，从苇丛里向外张望。一只绿色的小汽船刚一到，大水喊声“打”，火捻子都点着了，几十只土枪一齐轰隆隆的打出去，跟地雷一样，直黑了天的降烟。也看不清打得怎样了，光听见汽船突突突的响。牛小水低声说：“真邪门！怎么回事儿？人死了没有呀？又不还枪，又不开船走！”大水说：“别作声！瞧！”
    烟散了，看得见汽船上一个人也没有了，那汽船在水面上打转儿呢。赵五更忙说：“我去探探！”他拿了小水的一把刀子，跳下水，一个蒙子扎过去。汽船忽然又开走了。苇丛里的小船都钻出来，大家着急的要开枪。可是赵五更从汽船旁边露出头来了。五更那精瘦的身上流着水，悄悄的扒着船梆，往里瞧，见一个日本鬼子爬在船尾巴上瞄着枪呢。他连忙翻进船里，鬼子一回头，尖刀已经插进了这鬼子的后心窝，再一刀，就死了。
    汽船里面，歪三倒四的好几个死尸。船可还是突突突的往前开，越走越是个快。急得赵五更东摸摸，西揣揣，拿那个机器没办法，慌忙站起来，朝后面招手喊：“快来哟！这玩艺儿弄不住，别给跑喽！”立时二十只小船象赛跑似的，哗哗哗划着，都来捉汽船。汽船可跑得更快了，追也追不上。急得赵五更慌手慌脚的又去扒机器，弄不成，又站起来，挥着双手大喊：“快啊！快啊！他妈的！这玩艺儿……跑得快！你们快使劲儿呀！”汽船直冲直撞，一下子闯到一片苇子地，嘟嘟嘟的还想往里钻；大伙儿追上来，才把它促住了。
