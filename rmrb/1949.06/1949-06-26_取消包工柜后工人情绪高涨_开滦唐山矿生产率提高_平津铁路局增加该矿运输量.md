　　Workers' Morale Soars After Cancellation of Contracting Teams
  　Production Rate Increases at Kailuan Tangshan Mine
    Pingjin Railway Bureau Increases Transport Volume of the Mine
    [Tangshan Dispatch] Following the decision by the Kailuan Tangshan Mine Workers' Preparatory Committee on the 18th of last month to abolish the contracting system of the Third External Labor Group, it immediately began mobilizing workers to discuss the establishment of a worker-managed production cooperative to manage production. After days of deliberation and preparation by over 800 workers in the group, nine committee members were finally elected on the 17th of this month to form a cooperative committee, ready to take over management and sign a contract with the mine. The underground workers of Kailuan Tangshan Mine are extremely supportive of this measure, their production enthusiasm is high, and output has also increased accordingly. For example, the production efficiency of the seven-lane coal miners of the Third Group (calculated as one coal miner working eight hours) was 1.47 carts (each cart weighing 420 kg, same below) on May 6th, which increased to 2.04 carts by the end of May, and further to 2.23 carts on June 4th, exceeding the standard output of Kailuan coal miners for the past three years (756 kg) by 180 kg. On June 15th, the 220 coal face workers of the Third Group produced a total of 660 carts of coal, with an average efficiency of 3 carts per person, breaking through the one-ton mark. The No. 7544 tunnel in the seventh lane of the Third Group had the highest coal output, with each coal miner's coal production reaching 3.42 carts on average from May 15th to May 20th, reaching 190 percent of the standard output. The highest efficiency on May 31st even reached 5.04 carts, almost three times the standard production rate.
    [Tianjin Dispatch] Under the strong support of the North China People's Government, the livelihood of the employees of the Tangshan Kailuan Mining Bureau has been guaranteed, and the production efficiency has gradually improved. Recently, the Pingjin Railway Bureau also increased the mine's transport volume from 2,300 tons to 12,300 tons per day, so that Luan coal can be smoothly transported to various places, which will greatly contribute to the rapid recovery of the mine's output. It is reported that in June, the mine successively received loans of 450 million yuan from the Tianjin People's Bank and 12 million jin of miscellaneous grains from the North China Trade Corporation in exchange for coal, which enabled it to pay off the accumulated wages for April and half of May, as well as the in-kind portion of the wages for the first ten days of June, thus basically solving the livelihood of the employees. According to the plan for assisting Kailuan issued by the North China People's Government on June 6, the North China Trade Corporation will exchange Luan coal for 150,000 bags of flour every month in the future. The first batch of 100,000 bags of flour will be allocated to the mine before the end of the month.

　　取消包工柜后工人情绪高涨
  　开滦唐山矿生产率提高
    平津铁路局增加该矿运输量
    【唐山电】上月十八日开滦唐山矿职工筹委会决议取消外工第三组包工大柜后，即着手发动工人讨论建立由工人自己伙包的生产合作社，管理生产。经过该组八百余工人多日的研讨酝酿，已于本月十七日最后选出社务委员九人组成合作社委员会，准备进行接管，与矿方订立合同。开滦唐山矿的井下工人们对这一措施极为拥护，生产情绪高涨，产量也随之提高，如三组井下七道行煤工的生产效率（煤工一人工作八小时计算）五月六日为一点四七车（每车四二零公斤，下同），五月底即增加到二点零四车，六月四日增至二点二三车，超过开滦煤工三年来的标准产量（七五六公斤）一八○公斤。六月十五日三组全体煤洞工人二二○人共出煤六六○车，平均每人达到三车的效率，突破一吨的产量。三组七道行七五四四号洞出煤最多，每个煤工产煤由五月十五日至五月二十日的平均数三点四二车达到标准产量的百分之一百九十。五月三十一日最高效率竟达五点零四车，几乎达到标准生产率的三倍。
    【天津电】唐山开滦矿务局，在华北人民政府大力扶助下，职工生活得到保障，生产效率逐步提高。最近平津铁路局并将该矿的运输量由每日二千三百吨增至一万二千三百吨，使滦煤得以畅运各地，将大大的有助于该矿产量的迅速恢复。按该矿于六月份曾先后由天津人民银行贷款四亿五千万元，华北贸易总公司以易煤方式拨杂粮一千二百万斤，得以发清了职工四月份及五月份半个月的积欠工资，及六月份上旬工资中的实物部分，使职工生活基本上得到解决。又根据六月六日华北人民政府援助开滦方案规定，今后华北贸易总公司每月均将以十五万袋面粉的物资交换滦煤，首批面粉十万袋月底以前即可拨交矿方。
