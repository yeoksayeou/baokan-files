Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 6th: Major light industrial factories in Shanghai, such as the Pacific Weaving Factory and the San You Industrial Society, have resumed production, with output increasing compared to pre-liberation levels. According to the director of San You Industrial Society, the San You main factory originally had over 1,000 cloth and towel machines, but was destroyed by Japanese imperialist artillery fire during the "August 13th" Incident. The Hangzhou branch factory was also forced to be sold entirely during the enemy-puppet rule in 1941. Afterwards, the remaining assets were reorganized, and the First Factory was established on Nanshi Railway Station Road in the city, with only 300 workers and 50 cloth and towel machines. Before liberation, due to social and economic instability, production was intermittent, and finished products had no market, with a daily output of only 150 pieces. After liberation, thanks to the active protection of the factory by staff and workers, production has now resumed, with a daily output of 400 pieces. The Pacific Weaving Factory, which is fully operational, now produces 476 pieces daily, an increase of approximately 70 to 80 pieces compared to pre-liberation.

　　三友实业社等工厂复工　产量比解放前增加
    【新华社上海六日电】沪市轻工业太平洋织造厂、三友实业社等主要工厂均已复工，产量并已较解放前增加。据三友实业社厂长谈称，三友总厂原有布机毛巾机共一千余台，“八一三”时毁于日本帝国主义的炮火下；杭州分厂亦于民国三十年敌伪统治时期被迫整个出售。迨后始整理残余，设第一厂于本市南市车站路，仅有工人三百名，布机毛巾机五十台。解放前因社会经济动荡不安，做一天停一天，成品无销路，日出仅一百五十件。解放后因职员工人积极护厂，现已复工，每日出品已达四百件。全部开工的太平洋织造厂，现每日出品四七六件，较解放前亦增加约七八十件。
