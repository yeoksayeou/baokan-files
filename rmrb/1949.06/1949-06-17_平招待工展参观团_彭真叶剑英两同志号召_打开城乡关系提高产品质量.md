At the meeting, the delegations from various regions widely exchanged opinions on the development of production and material exchange. Regarding the guidance of urban production and the issue of public production plans, after representatives from various regions explained the production and needs of their respective areas, Comrade Peng Zhen pointed out that the types, specifications, and quantities of products needed by each region in the future should be specifically studied. He also reminded that special attention should be paid to improving product quality and reducing production costs during production, and the production quantity should be determined according to the needs. Regarding the organization of material exchange in various regions, Mayor Ye summarized the opinions put forward by the delegations from various regions in various symposiums in recent days, saying that according to the various signs currently manifested, it shows that we are suffering from indigestion economically. In order to make the digestive system normal and metabolize, we must solve the problems of raw materials sales, we must open up urban-rural, internal and external relations, organize transportation, and organize trade; we must abolish various artificial restrictions and obstacles in various places. He also explained that comprehensive consideration must be given to trade activities, and the gains and losses of only one part should not be considered. It is necessary to mobilize and organize private merchants and public trading companies and cooperatives to jointly open up urban-rural relations. He called on cadres engaged in economic work to correctly publicize and master the comprehensive policies in all directions. Finally, Comrade Peng Zhen suggested that delegations from various regions should hold discussions according to the nature of their work to exchange experiences and maintain regular contact with the trade guidance agencies in Beiping in order to organize the exchange of urban-rural materials and restore and develop production.
