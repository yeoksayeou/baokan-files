Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, June 6th: The CCP Central Northeast Bureau, the Northeast Administrative Committee, and the Northeast Military Region are organizing their directly affiliated organs to study Marxist-Leninist theory and various policies. The Propaganda Department of the Northeast Bureau announced a study plan for on-the-job cadres of directly affiliated organs of the Northeast Bureau, the Northeast Administrative Committee, and the Northeast Military Region on May 27th. The plan points out: Organizing all levels of on-the-job cadres to study Marxist-Leninist theory and various specific policies of the Chinese revolution is one of the important tasks of 1949. This study is inseparable from the great shift in the focus of the Northeast Party's work from rural areas to cities. Cadres in all work departments should earnestly study and research current economic construction policies, especially industrial construction policies, and related issues. This should be the prerequisite for studying and improving their departments' work to better coordinate and complete the Party's central tasks. The plan stipulates that all on-the-job cadres should be divided into groups based on their political theory and cultural level to study. To ensure the completion of the study plan, the Northeast Bureau, the Northeast Administrative Committee, and the Northeast Military Region have jointly formed a general study committee to lead, plan, and supervise the cadre study of their affiliated units. The study time is uniformly set at two hours per day. The General Study Committee also plans to hire a number of comrades with theoretical research experience as study consultants to answer questions and solve difficult problems through regular meetings or a "correspondence mailbox." After the study plan was announced, the Northeast Daily published an editorial entitled "Combining Work and Study," pointing out that work tasks and study tasks are consistent. Policy and theory study is not only not contradictory to business study, but it is precisely necessary for improving business. All work methods that use the excuse of having too much work to avoid studying, and only lead subordinate cadres to carry out work without paying attention to leading them to study, are wrong.

In other news: The Northeast Bureau convened a mobilization meeting for on-the-job cadres of its affiliated departments and commissions on the 2nd. At the meeting, Li Zhuoran, Minister of the Propaganda Department of the Northeast Bureau, pointed out that the most fundamental and widespread shortcoming among cadres at present is that their level of Marxist-Leninist theory is not high, and they lack a systematic and in-depth understanding of the Party's various policies. Therefore, to improve the quality and business of cadres, it is necessary to start with strengthening systematic theoretical study. In the future, in order to facilitate leadership in learning, study lectures will be set up using radio stations, and radios will be universally set up in various agencies to listen. The meeting announced that cadre study will begin next week.

　　中共中央东北局　公布在职干部学习计划
    指出：应认真研习经济建设政策及其有关的各种问题。
    【新华社沈阳六日电】中共中央东北局、东北行政委员会、东北军区组织所属各直属机关干部学习马克思列宁主义理论和各种政策。东北局宣传部已于五月二十七日公布东北局、东北行政委员会与东北军区直属各机关在职干部学习计划。该计划指出：在各级在职干部中组织进行马克思列宁主义理论及中国革命各种具体政策的学习乃是一九四九年的重要任务之一。这种学习是与贯彻东北全党工作重点由乡村移到城市的巨大转变分不开的，一切工作部门的干部均应认真学习和研究目前经济建设特别是工业建设的政策及其有关的各种问题，并以此为前提去研究与提高本部门的业务，以便更好地配合完成党的中心任务。该计划规定：一切在职干部都应当按政治理论文化水平的高低分别编组进行学习。为保证学习计划的完成，东北局、东北行政委员会与东北军区联合组成总学委会，领导、计划和督促检查所属各单位的干部学习。学习时间统一规定为每天两小时。总学委会并拟聘请若干对理论有研究的同志作学习顾问，以定期开会或“函授信箱”的方式解答疑难问题。学习计划公布后，东北日报特以“工作与学习结合起来”为题，发表社论，指出：工作任务与学习任务是一致的，政策理论学习不仅不与业务学习相矛盾，而且正是为提高业务所必需。一切借口工作多而不去学习，和只领导所属干部进行工作，而不注意领导他们去进行学习的工作方法，都是错误的。
    又讯：东北局已于二日召开所属部委在职干部学习动员大会。会上东北局宣传部李卓然部长指出：目前干部中最根本的和最普遍的缺点是马克思列宁主义理论水平不高，对党的各种政策缺乏有系统的和深入的了解。因此，要提高干部的质量和业务，必须从加强有系统的理论学习着手。今后为便于学习上的领导，将利用广播台设立学习讲座，各机关将普遍设置收音机收听。会议宣布干部学习于下周开始。
