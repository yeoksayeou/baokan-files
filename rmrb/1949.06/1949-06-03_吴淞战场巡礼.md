Frontline reporter reports: When the People's Liberation Army, striking directly at the throat of the Huangpu River, launched a general offensive on the Wusong Fortress on the evening of May 25th, a portion of the Kuomintang bandit troops besieged in Yanghang fled in disarray towards Wusong, attempting to board ships and escape. On the road leading to Wusong, the PLA soldiers, courageously pursuing, ran and excitedly shouted to each other, "Hurry, chase them! Let's go to Wusong to capture prisoners!" Shells from榴弹炮 howitzers whistled overhead towards the fortress. The road was littered with military supplies abandoned by the bandit troops: clothing, piles of cement for building fortifications, sand, iron wire, steel bars, gasoline drums, unburied landmines, and large artillery pieces left intact on the positions. On the morning of the 26th, when the reporter arrived at Wusong, the People's Liberation Army had already captured the fortress, and groups of hundreds and thousands of prisoners were being escorted down. Some prisoners were even carrying their wives and children, suitcases, backpacks, and net baskets. On the highway south of the Yunzaobang Bridge, lay many Kuomintang soldiers crushed to death by the fleeing bandit tanks. Hundreds of tanks were strewn about on the roads around Wusong; a chaotic mix of colorful and dirty objects, howitzers, mountain guns, field guns, armored vehicles, and ammunition. The villages on both sides of the road were in ruins. White flags of surrender, made of white bed sheets or white pants, flew on the concrete fortifications at the edge of the villages. The bandits initially demolished villages to build fortifications, and later set fires and fled, but in the end, they could only raise white flags on the fortifications. Many PLA soldiers were pushing newly captured cannons on the road, and barefoot in the ponds, retrieving weapons discarded by the bandit troops. Watching the lines of prisoners and the countless spoils of war, the soldiers exclaimed happily, "It's just like the Huaihai Campaign all over again!" The fleeing bandits had burned over a thousand vehicles of all kinds, including trucks and armored vehicles, fully loaded with ammunition and supplies. These vehicles stretched for more than three miles along the highway and burned for twenty-four hours. However, after these bandits rushed to board warships at the mouth of the Wusong River, over two thousand were pushed into the river and drowned. On the 27th, many enemy corpses were still floating on the Huangpu River. The American-supplied materials on the last train from Shanghai to Wusong were all captured by the PLA, as the bandits no longer had time to destroy them.

　　吴淞战场巡礼
    前线记者报道：当直扑黄浦江咽喉的人民解放军于五月二十五日晚上对吴淞要塞发动总攻时，困守杨行的国民党匪军一部就朝着吴淞方向狼狈溃逃，企图登舰逃命。在通往吴淞的公路上，奋勇追击的解放军战士们，一面跑一面兴高采烈地互相喊叫着：“快追呀，快到吴淞捉俘虏去！”榴弹炮的炮弹不断嘶声地从头顶上飞向要塞。沿途满是匪军丢弃的军火，衣物，修工事用的一堆堆水泥，沙土，铁丝，钢筋，汽油桶，没有埋好的地雷，和完整地遗留在阵地上的大炮。二十六日晨，当记者赶赴吴淞时，人民解放军已经攻占了要塞，成百成千的一群群俘虏正被押下来了。有些俘虏还带着老婆孩子，皮箱，背包，网篮，蕴藻浜大桥南面公路上，躺着许多被匪军溃逃的坦克压死的国民党士兵。吴淞周围的各公路上，狼藉着成百辆的坦克；花花绿绿的脏物和榴弹炮，山炮，野炮，装甲车，弹药堆在一起。公路两侧的村庄已成一片废墟，村边钢骨水泥工事上飘着匪军乞降的白旗，有的是用白被单做的，有的是用白裤子做的。匪徒们起初是拆村落修筑工事，后来是纵火逃跑，可是最后他们只能在工事上插白旗了。许多解放军战士在路上推着新缴获的大炮，赤着脚在池塘里打捞匪军扔下的武器。看着一队队的俘虏群和遍野收集不过来的胜利品，战士们高兴得叫起来说：“又象是淮海战役了！”逃匪曾焚毁上千辆满载弹药物资的各色汽车，牵引车和装甲车，这些车辆在公路上摆了三里多长，一直燃烧了二十四小时之久。可是这些匪徒们在吴淞口抢登军舰后，互相推到江里淹死的就有两千多人。二十七日黄浦江上还漂浮着许多敌尸。匪军从上海开到吴淞的最后一列火车的美援物资，这些匪徒们却再顾不上破坏而被解放军全部缴获了。
