　　Second Day of the National Engine Operations Conference
  　Reporting Experiences with the Engine Operations Responsibility System
    [Report from our newspaper] The National Engine Operations Conference of the Military Commission's Ministry of Railways entered its second day yesterday (the 28th). The conference began at 7:30 AM, with representatives from various railway bureaus continuing to deliver work reports. The representative from the Jinan Railway Bureau first reported on the general situation of the bureau's engine operations work. In conclusion, they stated that they had accumulated five points of experience in engine operations work and were willing to offer them for everyone's reference:
    Jinan
    (1) Oppose setting empty plans; all plans should come from the masses and go back to the masses. (2) The working class is the greatest; it can actively overcome difficulties and transform all adverse environments. (3) Communist Party members have played a shining leading role in the responsibility system. (4) The conservative thinking of sticking to old ways must be broken to develop the work. (5) The task and direction must be clear; the implementation of all work must have foresight and be carried out step by step and according to plan.
    Jiangnan
    The representative from the Shanghai Railway Administration reported on the general situation of engine operations work and the takeover of the Shanghai-Nanjing area lines. Because Shanghai and other places were liberated not long ago, the responsibility system is yet to be implemented. Finally, they put forward seven suggestions for discussion at the conference: (1) Unify inspection regulations and usage limits; (2) Promote the joint transport vehicle inspection responsibility system, simplify track crossing procedures, and formulate methods for repair on behalf of others and account transfers; (3) Unify the numbering of passenger and freight cars nationwide; (4) Unify the organizational structure of railway engine operations departments nationwide; (5) Unify the nomenclature of parts for passenger and freight cars; (6) Unify the names of railway engine operations equipment; (7) Publish books related to engine operations training.
    The engine operations representatives from the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway, the southern section of the Beijing-Hankou Railway, and the Guangdong-Hankou Railway, after explaining the situations of their respective engine operations departments, sections, and factories, stated that under the past corrupt and incompetent rule and severe sabotage of the Kuomintang reactionaries, passenger and freight cars were insufficient, sleepers were in disrepair due to age, and engine factory machinery, materials, and fuel were all difficult to obtain, with coal supply being a historically serious difficulty. Due to the Kuomintang reactionaries' corruption and self-enrichment, these railways were never well-constructed, were dilapidated, extremely inefficient, and suffered enormous waste and losses. Today, now that the railways have been returned to the people, the people urgently need the Ministry of Railways to vigorously rectify them. They all unanimously expressed their willingness to learn from the advanced railway engine operations workers in the old liberated areas, strive to transform their thinking, and lay the foundation for preparing to implement the engine operations work responsibility system.
    Northeast
    The conference continued at 2 PM. Comrade Ma Jun, Director of the Engine Operations Department of the Northeast Railway General Administration, reported on the implementation of the responsibility system in the engine operations departments of the Northeast Railway over the past three years. Comrade Ma Jun first started with the crew responsibility system, explaining that the definition of the responsibility system is: "A certain group of workers (several workers, two or three shifts of workers) regularly use a certain machine or locomotive, so that each person is responsible for a certain machine or locomotive and a certain task." He then reported on the implementation of the responsibility system on the Northeast Railway: After the Northeast Railway Party Committee decided and the Northeast Bureau of the CCP approved the implementation of the responsibility system in September 1948, the love of the crew for the locomotives, the strengthening of their sense of responsibility, the learning of inspection and repair, and even the direct participation in inspection and repair resulted in brilliant achievements. Due to the implementation of the contracted crew system, according to the statistics for the first quarter of 1949: the daily car-kilometers of freight train locomotives reached 317.1 kilometers (336 kilometers in March), which is 106.8 kilometers more than the statistics for the first quarter of 1948 (210.3 kilometers); the daily car-kilometers of usable cars reached 263.7, which is 61.7 kilometers more than the 202 kilometers last year; the number of cars required per 100,000 kilometers has been reduced to 379, a decrease of 117.5 compared to last year's 496.5; the average traction conversion for the entire line has reached 28.3, an increase of 9 conversions compared to last year's 19.3; the kilometers traveled by locomotives between Class A inspections has increased to 46,631 kilometers, an increase of 20,700 kilometers compared to last year's 25,931 kilometers; the average man-hours used for a Class A inspection has been reduced to 1,642.4 hours, a decrease of 17.3 hours compared to last year's 1,659.7 hours. Then, he also raised four issues in the contracted car system: (1) Three-shift system or two-shift system? (2) Large section vs. small section issues; (3) Formalistic contracted car system; (4) Contracted car joint group issues. At the same time, he also pointed out the development of the contracted crew system: (1) Three-contract system (contract for repair, contract for inspection, contract for guidance); (2) Inspection system based on mileage; (3) Water discharge and tank cleaning system; (4) New driving system; (5) Safety kilometer reward system; (6) Locomotive circular operation system. Finally, he emphasized four issues that still need effort in the engine operations work responsibility system: (1) Grasp the principle of speed and stability, and overcome adventurism; (2) Strengthen the study of technology and regulations; (3) Strengthen the importance of combining the inspection and repair responsibility system with the contracted crew and repair responsibility system; (4) Strive to improve political awareness and prevent the activities of saboteurs. The conference will continue today (the 29th), with typical reports from Northeast labor model heroes for the reference of representatives from various regions.

　　全国机务会议第二日
  　报告机务负责制经验
    【本报讯】军委铁道部全国机务会议昨（二十八）日进入第二日，大会在上午七时半开始，由各局代表继续作工作报告。济南铁路局代表首先报告该局机务工作概况。最后在结论中说：他们在机务工作中积累了五点经验，愿意提供大家参考：
    济南
    （一）反对定空头计划，一切计划应从群众中来到群众中去。（二）工人阶级是最伟大的，它能主动克服困难，改造一切恶劣环境。（三）共产党员在负责制中起了光辉的带头作用。（四）墨守成规的守旧思想必须打破，工作才能得到开展。（五）任务方针要明确；推行一切的工作，必须有它的预见性，有步骤有计划地去推行。
    江南
    上海铁路管理局代表报告机务工作概况及京沪区线路接管情形。因为上海等地解放不久，负责制正待推行。最后，他们提出了七项建议，提请大会讨论：（一）统一检修规章及使用限度；（二）推行联运车辆检修负责制，简化过轨手续，制定代修转帐办法；（三）全国机客货车统一编号；（四）统一全国铁路机务处组织问题；（五）统一机客货车部分品名词；（六）统一铁路机务设备名称；（七）印发有关机务训练的书籍。
    浙赣路、平汉南段、粤汉路的机务代表在说明了他们的各机务处、段、厂的情况之后说：在国民党反动派过去腐败无能统治管理及严重的破坏之下，客货车辆不敷应用，枕木年久失修，机厂机器材料及燃料均感困难，而煤的供给是历史上的严重困难。由于国民党反动派的贪污自肥，从未很好的建设这些铁路，破烂不堪，效率极低，浪费损失庞大。今天，铁路归还人民以后，人民亟需铁道部大力整顿。他们都一致表示要向老解放区各先进铁道机务员工学习，努力改造思想，为准备实行机务工作负责制度打下基础。
    东北
    下午二时大会继续举行。由东北铁路总局机务部长马钧同志报告东北铁路三年来机务部门施行负责制的情况。马钧同志首先从乘务负责制谈起，解释负责制的定义是：“由一定的工人集团（几个工人，二班或三班的工人）经常使用一定的机器或机车，使每一个人对一定的机器或机车和一定的工作负责。”随即他报告东北铁路实施负责制经过：东北铁路自一九四八年九月经东北铁路党委决定，中共东北局批准后开始实行负责制，由于乘务员工对机车的爱护，责任感加强，学习检修，以至直接参加检修的结果，创造了辉煌的成绩。由于实行了包乘制，据一九四九年第一季的统计：货物列车机车日车公里已达三一七·一公里（三月份为三三六公里），比一九四八年第一季日车公里（二一○·三公里）的统计，超出了一○六·八公里；使用车日车公里已达二六三·七，比去年二○二公里超出了六一·七公里；每十万公里需要使用车数已减至三七九辆，较之去年四九六·五辆，减少了一一七·五辆；全路平均牵引换算已达二八·三，较去年一九·三换算，增加了九个换算；甲检间机车走行公里已提高至四六六三一公里，较去年二五九三一公里，增加了二○七○○公里；甲检一台平均使用工时已减至一六四二·四小时，较之去年一六五九·七小时，减少了一七·三小时。接着，他并提出包车制中的四个问题：（一）三班制还是两班制？（二）大区间小区间问题；（三）形式主义的包车制；（四）包车联合组问题。同时他还指出包乘制的发展：（一）三包制（包修、包检、包指导）；（二）按里程定检制；（三）放水与洗罐制；（四）新行车制；（五）安全公里奖励制；（六）机车循环运转制。最后他着重提出机务工作负责制中还需努力的四个问题：（一）掌握快与稳的原则，克服冒险主义；（二）加强技术与规章的学习；（三）加强检修负责制及包乘包修负责制工作的结合的重要性；（四）努力提高政治觉悟，防止破坏分子活动。今（二十九）日大会继续举行，将由东北劳模英雄作典型报告，以为各地代表的参考。
