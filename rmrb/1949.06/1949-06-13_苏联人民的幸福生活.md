The more than two million people of Moscow now use economical and convenient gas. The Soviet Council of Ministers recently issued an order to "increase the gas supply to Moscow," which will further ensure that all apartments in the city have access to gas by 1952. Using gas for cooking, preparing food, and boiling water is more economical and easier to control than electric stoves, and cleaner and more convenient than coal stoves, greatly benefiting every cafeteria, apartment, and household. This large-scale, economical gas supply is only possible in socialist Soviet Union, and it fully demonstrates that only a socialist country can enable its people to continuously improve their happy lives.

　　苏联人民的幸福生活
    莫斯科二百万以上的人民现在均使用着经济而又便利的煤气，苏联部长会议最近又发布“增加莫斯科煤气供应”的命令，将于一九五二年进一步使全市公寓均可得到煤气供应。使用煤气煮饭做菜烧水，较电炉经济而容易控制，较煤炉干净而方便，大大便利了每一个食堂、公寓及家庭。这种大规模经济的煤气供应是只有在社会主义的苏联才有可能，也十足的证明，只有社会主义的国家，才能使人民日益提高其幸福生活。
