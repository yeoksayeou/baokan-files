  　Jianping County Disaster Victims Find Work in Carrying Goods, Spinning Wool, and Making Shoe Soles
    [Chahar News] Jianping County has suffered from continuous drought for years. The masses have very little savings, and last year there was a complete crop failure. In addition, there were no means of production in winter, and no living expenses were earned for this spring. Many households in various districts are currently without food, and some are living only on bran and vegetables. Based on this situation, the county party committee has adopted various measures to overcome the famine through production. The leadership proposed starting from small things and from multiple angles, helping the masses as much as possible in transportation, sales, labor, shoe making, firewood gathering, lime burning, etc. According to incomplete statistics, the following results have been achieved: Organizing the families of revolutionary martyrs and impoverished women to sew shoe soles, with more than 1,400 people participating in the first, third, fourth, and eighth districts, earning more than 67,500 catties of corn, which can solve the livelihood of more than 1,500 people for a month. Organizing animal transport is relatively common and profitable. For example, in the first, second, third, fifth, sixth, and seventh districts, transporting planks, only the first and second districts transported 5.9 million catties of planks and earned 3.6 million RMB, which can buy 360 shi of corn. Fan Guilin of Baishuwan Village in the second district hauls coal three times a day, earning a net profit of 24 catties of rice, which solves the family's living difficulties. Other activities such as spinning wool have also solved the living difficulties of many households. At the same time, the masses are organized to gather wild vegetables and pick tree leaves, saving and helping each other. For example, in Shuiyu Village in the first district, wild vegetables and tree leaves are picked and eaten as they are gathered, and more than 2,400 catties are left over to eat until summer. Households with more grain lend rice to poor households. For example, Qi Chunchang of Taoke Village in the first district lent three shi of millet to be returned after the summer harvest, which is strongly supported by the disaster victims. (Han Ji)

　　从多方面下手
  　组织生产战胜灾荒
  　驮脚纺毛纳鞋底建屏灾民有活作
    【察哈尔讯】建屏县连年旱灾，群众积蓄很少，去年又全年歉收，加之冬季生产无门路，未赚出今春生活费用。各区眼下没吃的户很多，有的则只靠糠菜度日，县委根据此种情况，采取了各种生产渡荒措施。首先拨救济粮一万五千六百七十斤安置孤寡老弱；拨干部补助粮与优军粮三万四千余斤，中农补偿粮三万五千五百余斤。并大力组织群众生产渡荒。领导上提出从小处从多方面着手，运输、运销、做工、做鞋、打柴、烧石灰等能做多少就帮助群众做多少。据不完全统计，已得到如下成绩：组织烈军工属及穷苦妇女纳鞋底，一、三、四、八区共参加一千四百余人，赚玉米六万七千五百余斤，可解决一千五百余人一个月的生活。组织牲畜驮运较普遍，获利也大。如一、二、三、五、六、七区驮木板，只一、二区运木板五百九十万斤、赚人民币三百六十万元。可买玉米三百六十大石。二区柏树湾村范贵林拉石炭每天往返三次，净赚米二十四斤。解决全家生活困难。其他如纺毛线等也都解决了不少户的生活困难。同时组织群众打野菜、采树叶省吃俭用互济互借，如一区水峪村采树叶野菜随采随吃，还余下二千四百多斤可吃到夏天，粮多户借米给穷户，如一区桃科村齐春昌借出小米三石，夏收后归还，灾户十分拥护。（韩骥）
