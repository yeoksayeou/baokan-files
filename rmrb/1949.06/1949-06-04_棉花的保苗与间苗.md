　　Cotton Seedling Protection and Thinning
　　Xu Jingzhong
　　I. Preventing and Eliminating Diseases and Pests: Cotton seedlings are most susceptible to diseases and pests after they emerge from the soil. One should frequently inspect the fields, and if wilted or dead seedlings are found, it indicates the presence of diseases or pests. Immediately investigate the cause. If the seedling body is uninjured but has rotten spots, it is likely due to seedling blight, anthracnose, or other diseases. Immediately remove the diseased seedlings and bury them deeply in the soil to prevent the spread of pathogens to other healthy seedlings. If the seedling roots are found to be bitten or severed, it can be determined that cutworms are the culprit. Cutworms, also known as ground silkworms or cutworm larvae, are the earliest and most severe pests of cotton seedlings. They usually hide one or two inches below the ground near the affected cotton seedlings and can be dug out and killed immediately.
　　II. Remedying Missing Seedlings: After cotton seedlings emerge, if there are a few missing seedlings, or if seedlings are missing due to diseases or pests, it is best to replant them as soon as possible. If replanting is too late, use the transplanting method to fill in the gaps. There are two methods for transplanting:
　　1. Water First, Then Transplant: In dry land, thoroughly water the cotton seedlings to be transplanted. After the water has seeped in, use a small shovel to carefully dig out the seedlings with the soil attached (the soil block should be about three inches square and five inches deep, being careful not to break the soil block and expose the cotton roots). Transplant them into the pre-dug pits in the missing seedling areas, pile soil around the base, and then water them again. It is best to transplant cotton seedlings when they have true leaves.
　　2. Transplant First, Then Water: First, dig pits in the missing seedling areas, then use a small shovel to dig out the cotton seedlings to be transplanted. Transplant them into the pits in the missing seedling areas, and then water them thoroughly. The other procedures are the same as above. This method can be used in irrigated land or after rain when the soil is moist.
　　The above transplanting methods are mostly successful and do not hinder the development of the cotton seedlings. If transplanted on a cloudy day, the effect is even better. With patient transplanting, even if there are missing seedlings in the cotton field, they can be filled in.
　　III. Thinning and Fixing Seedlings: After cotton seedlings emerge from the soil, unwanted seedlings should be removed to leave good seedlings at appropriate spacing for cotton growth, so that the remaining good seedlings can develop fully. This work should not be done too early, as there may be missing seedlings later that cannot be remedied. However, it should not be done too late either, as it will waste soil nutrients. Generally, thinning and fixing seedlings can be done in two stages. The first thinning should be done when the seedlings are two to three inches tall. Whether using hands or a hoe, be careful not to disturb the other good seedlings to be retained, and do not leave excessively large gaps in the soil around the roots, to avoid wind damage to the cotton roots. The first thinning is to temporarily adjust the uneven density of the cotton seedlings, making the spacing relatively even, leaving a strong seedling approximately every three to four inches. As the saying goes, "Leave the sparse in the dense areas, and the dense in the sparse areas; if neither sparse nor dense, leave the larger ones." This is the key to thinning. The second fixing should be done when the seedlings are four to five inches tall. Pay attention to the position of the seedlings left in each row, ensuring they are not aligned with the seedlings in the adjacent rows. It is best to leave the seedlings in the middle of the space between two seedlings in the adjacent row. This way, the cotton branches will extend alternately in the future, avoiding conflicts and crowding. As for the distance between plants, it should be determined based on the row spacing and the fertility of the soil. For example, if the row spacing is two feet, the plant spacing for American cotton is usually about one foot and two inches, and for Chinese cotton it is about six to eight inches. In fertile soil, the plant spacing can be increased, and in poor soil, it can be reduced. The spacing in irrigated land can be wider, while in dry land it should be closer. But be careful: "It's better to have money to buy seeds than to buy seedlings!" It is absolutely forbidden to have wide row spacing, poor soil, and then recklessly widen the plant spacing. If the number of cotton seedlings is too small, it is equivalent to missing seedlings, and the harvest will inevitably be reduced.
　　IV. Preventing Drought and Flooding: Although cotton is a drought-resistant crop, there is a farming proverb that says "Seeing seedlings means a 30% harvest." However, if there is a drought after the rain, even if the cotton seedlings do not die, it will affect their development. Even if it rains again later, the yield will be greatly reduced. Therefore, it is still necessary to pay attention to drought prevention. This requires early cultivation to prevent moisture evaporation from the soil and frequent weeding to prevent weeds from stealing nutrients from the seedlings. In addition, spot watering can also be carried out in dry land: use wooden or iron pegs to puncture holes near the cotton seedlings, about three to four inches deep, being careful not to squeeze or injure the cotton seedlings. Then, use a kettle to pour water into the holes and immediately cover with soil. If this irrigation method is applied to dry fields after fixing the seedlings, it not only uses limited water and is easy to do, but also can concentrate and penetrate deeply, maintaining the development of the cotton seedlings until the summer rains arrive.
　　As for irrigated land, if the soil is dry after the cotton seedlings emerge, it is also important to irrigate once, because "watering before wheat is almost always beneficial." After watering, cultivate with a hoe to loosen the soil surface and thin the seedlings. In this way, even if there is a long period of drought, it can be maintained for a long time without hindering the development of the cotton seedlings.
　　In addition to drought prevention, it is also necessary to pay attention to flood prevention. Cotton is afraid of continuous overcast and rainy weather and excessively wet soil. North China often experiences drought followed by floods, so low-lying cotton fields should have ditches dug around the cotton fields in advance to prepare for drainage, in order to prevent the risk of cotton being damp, shedding buds and bolls, or even being flooded.
　　V. Applying Topdressing Fertilizer: If you want to harvest more cotton, you must apply more fertilizer. If no base fertilizer has been applied before sowing, or very little has been applied, topdressing fertilizer must be applied. The application period is usually when the seedlings are five to six inches tall (at the latest before flowering). The application rate per mu is about 50 to 100 jin of cottonseed cake; about 30 to 80 jin of soybean cake or peanut cake; and about 100 to 150 jin of manure.
　　The application of topdressing fertilizer should be determined based on the actual conditions of the cotton field soil and local climate, specifying the application depth, as the effect of topdressing fertilizer is greatly influenced by soil and climate, and special attention should be paid to:
　　1. Soil: Topdressing fertilizer should be applied shallowly in sandy soil. If it is too deep, the fertilizer will often leak into the lower layers of the soil after rain and be useless; but in clay soil, it should be deeper, so that the cotton roots can easily absorb it.
　　2. Climate: Apply shallowly when it is about to rain, and deeply when there is no rain; apply deeply when it is often windy, and shallowly when there is no wind. If it is not clear, you can also wait until after the rain to apply it, so that the cotton roots can absorb it immediately and see results quickly.

　　棉花的保苗与间苗
    许警众
    一、防除病虫棉苗才出土后，最容易遭受病虫害，应当常到田间视察，如见有枯萎或死去的，就是有了病虫害。要立刻查考原因，苗体无伤而有烂斑的，多为幼苗立枯、炭疽或其他病害，即刻把病苗拔去，深深埋入土中，免得病菌传染给其他的好苗。若见苗根有咬伤或两断的，就可测定是地老虎为害。地老虎，又叫地蚕或切根虫，是棉花幼苗时期为害最早最厉害的害虫，通常藏在被害棉苗地下一两寸深处，可即掘出杀掉。
    二、补救缺苗　棉苗出土后，若有少数缺苗，或因病虫缺了苗，最好早行补播，如补播已迟，可用移苗法补全。移苗的方法，有下列两种：
    １、先浇水后移苗，在旱地，先把所要移出的棉苗，充分浇水，水渗后即用小铲连苗带土铲出（土块大小，约为三寸见方深五寸，小心别把土块弄散，露出棉根），移入预先挖好的缺苗的坑内，并在四周壅土，然后再行浇水即可。移植棉苗最好在有真叶时举行。
    ２、先移苗后浇水，先在缺苗的地方挖坑再用小铲把所要移的棉苗铲出，移入缺苗的坑内，然后充分浇水。其他手术和上法相同。这个方法，在水浇地或雨后，因土湿可用。
    上述移苗方法，多能成活，且不妨害棉苗发育，若趁阴天移植，效果更好。只要耐心移植，棉田虽然缺苗，也可以补全。
    三、间苗定苗　棉苗出土后，要按照棉花生长的适当距离，留下好苗，把不需要的棉苗，尽行除去，以便所留的好苗，充分发育。这种工作，不可进行太早，太早将来恐再有缺苗，无法补救，但也不可太晚，损耗地力。一般间苗定苗，可分作两次进行。第一次在苗高二三寸时间苗，勿论用手拔或用锄头，都要注意不可牵动了其他要留的好苗，更不可使根旁土壤空隙过大，免得吹进风去，伤害棉根。第一次间苗，是先把棉苗出得稀密不匀的，暂且调整一下，距离远近，略为平均，约每隔三四寸远，留一强苗。俗话说：“稀留密，密留稀，不稀不密留大的”，这是间苗工作的诀窍。第二次是在苗高四五寸时定苗，要注意各行留苗的位置，不可和邻行的留苗齐列，最好在邻行两苗中间的方位留苗，这样将来棉枝交互伸长，不致抵触和拥挤。至于株距的远近，得按照行距的宽窄，和土地的肥瘦酌量规定。例如行距是二尺，那么美棉的株距，普通约为一尺二寸，中棉约为六寸至八寸。肥地尚可把株距再放远些，瘦地也可再缩近些。水浇地可以远些，旱地就要近些。但是要当心：“有钱买种，无钱买苗！”万不可行距既宽，土地又瘦，而再把株距胡乱放远，这样棉苗因数目太少，实已等于缺苗，将来收成必减。
    四、预防旱涝　棉花虽是耐旱作物，而有“见苗三分收”的农谚，但若从此雨后再旱，棉苗即使不至于死，也会影响发育，最后即再得雨，产量也必大为减低，所以今后仍须注意防旱。这就需要早行中耕，防止土壤中的水分蒸发，并勤除杂草，不让它夺取幼苗的养料。另外在旱地也可进行点浇：用木橛或铁橛在棉苗前后近傍扎穴，约三四寸深，小心勿挤动或碰伤棉苗，然后用壶向穴中注水，随即拨土掩盖。这种灌溉方法，若在定苗后施用于旱田，不但用水有限，轻而易举，且能集中深入，维持棉苗发育，以至接上夏雨。
    至于水浇地，棉苗出土后，若地土干燥，因为“麦前浇花，十年九不差”，也要注意灌水一次。浇水之后，要用锄头中耕，疏松土面，兼行间苗，这样，即使久晴不雨，也可维持至很长时间，无碍于棉苗发育。
    防旱之外，还要注意防涝。棉花怕连日阴雨，土地太湿，而华北地区又往往先早后涝，所以低洼的棉田，应当在棉田四周，预先开沟，准备排水，以防棉花受潮，落蕾落铃，甚至被淹的危险。
    五、施用追肥　种棉花要想收的多，就得多施肥，凡是在下种前未施用基肥及施用很少的，须施用追肥。施用时期普通多在苗高五六寸时（最迟必在开花以前）。每亩施用量若用棉籽饼约为五十斤至一百斤；若用豆饼或花生饼约为三十斤至八十斤；若用大粪约为一百斤至一百五十斤。
    施用追肥要斟酌棉田的土质和当地气候等实际情况，规定施用深浅，因追肥效果大小，土质和气候有很大影响，应当特别注意：
    ⒈土质　砂土地施用追肥要浅，如失之太深，雨后肥分往往漏入土壤下层。流失无用；但在黏土地上，就应深些，使棉根易于吸收。
    ⒉气候　天将下雨要浅施，无雨就深施；常刮风即深施，无风就浅施。如果推测不清，也可等雨后施用，这样可以使棉根即时吸收，很快的见效。
