Shanghai Communication:

    "Little Guangdong is the smartest, and his connections are the strongest!" This is what an old doorman at the Securities Building told me. Little Guangdong is none other than the notorious speculator Zhou Hanqing, a broker for Yongcheng Securities. His room, number 445 on the sixth floor, is truly luxuriously furnished. He not only has letters of recommendation from the former Minister of Finance Yu Hongjun, but also two lawyers specifically to speak for him, and a specially hired accountant. Because "Little Guangdong is the smartest and the strongest," there are countless people who "support" him or are in his grip. On his desk and on top of his safe are silver gifts presented by so-and-so, including a silver plaque meticulously engraved with the four characters "Trusted at Home and Abroad." Perhaps this criminal's speculative schemes in Shanghai are indeed "trusted at home and abroad"!

    The criminal's office consists of five interconnected rooms, with a long row of telephone switchboards, where at least fifty or more intercom telephones could be placed.

    The safe of the traitor Little Guangdong has not yet been opened, and many large and small locked leather suitcases have not yet been opened either. Just mixed in tea canisters, there are seventy-eight Yuan silver dollars. In an unlocked small leather suitcase, there are exactly three hundred silver dollars. In just one cabinet drawer, there are one hundred and ninety-nine silver dollars, two ten-tael gold bars, two five-tael gold bars, and twenty-eight one-tael gold ingots. Even in the corners of the floor, twenty silver dollars, four or five one-tael gold pieces, and one hundred and sixty US dollars were found. ...Just consider this small figure, how many millions has this traitor extorted from the blood and sweat of the people?

    The Securities Building is not only a speculative center controlling Shanghai's black market, but we also found a military telescope in room 349, and an American-made pistol with the number 18751 in a beautiful handbag in room 550. In the iron safe in room 503, we found an American-made large pistol, polished to a shine, and already loaded with five bullets!

    Don't think that this number is not large, that two guns and a few bullets don't matter! Today, we still have many safes that have not been opened. The secret agencies in this building that the people of Shanghai have reported to the government have not yet been destroyed, and more espionage equipment will eventually be found.

    "Old and Cunning," these four words are most appropriate for Shanghai's speculators. Last night around ten o'clock, just when the comrades of the Public Security Bureau responsible for handling the Securities Building were so tired they wanted to doze off, the guard troops guarding the building caught a young man in a small alley near the building. This young man, named Li Dexiang, lives at 348 Jianguo East Road. He was originally one of those surrounded by us in the building at ten o'clock the morning before yesterday. At that time, he was about to get on the elevator. Seeing that things were not right, he immediately stuffed a cloth bag of banknotes secretly into the alley, under the awning of a pedicab. Later, when he was interrogated, because there was no suspicious material on him, and he looked like a small silver dealer, he was released. After returning, he was ordered by his master ××× to sneak back in the dark to steal back the cloth bag of banknotes.

    The outside of his cloth bag was written with the three characters "Dayuan Hao." The bag contained 780,000 RMB. According to Li Dexiang's own confession, he was working as a messenger for ×××, taking the banknotes to room 251 of the building to exchange for gold or silver dollars for the black market. Therefore, if we are lenient with the still hidden enemies, we are committing a crime against the people.

    小广东和它的魔窟
    证券大楼主犯之一
    黄穗
    “小广东最灵光，牌头也最硬了!”这是证券大楼一个旧门警告诉我的。小广东就是投机市场里赫赫有名的奸犯周汉卿，是永成证券号的经纪人。他住的六楼四四五号房间，陈设的真是富丽堂皇，他不但有伪财政部长俞鸿钧等的证明书，而且还有两个专门为他说话的律师，也还有特聘的会计师。由于“小广东最灵光，又是最硬”，因此“捧”他或被他抓在手里的人不知有多少。他办公桌上和保险箱顶都摆有某某等敬赠之银质礼物，其中有一块银匾上精细地雕刻“信孚中外”四个大字。也许该犯在沪上的投机鬼计确是“信孚中外”！
    该犯的办公室一共贯通了五个房间，一长排电话机柜台，这里起码可以放上五十部以上的对讲电话机。
    奸犯小广东的保险箱子还没有开出来，许多大大小小锁着的皮箱也还没有开出来，光就杂在茶叶桶里的袁头就有七十八块，开着未锁的小皮箱里就有正三百个银元，光一个板柜的抽屉里就有一百九十九块大洋，两条十两重的金条，两条五两重的金条，二十八块一两重的金块。就是在角角落落的地板上也找到了二十块银元，四五块一两重的金子，一百六十块美钞。……光这个小小的数字，请算一下吧，奸犯剥削人民血汗何止千万？

    证券大楼不但是个操全沪黑市的投机中心，而且我们还在三四九号房间里抄出一只军用望远镜，在五五○号房间里一只漂亮的手提袋里抄出一支号码为１８７５１的美式手枪。而在五○三号房间里的铁保险箱里则抄出一支擦得雪亮的美式大型手枪，枪上已装好五颗子弹！
    不要以为这个数字并不大，两支枪几个子弹算不了什么！今天，我们还有许多保险箱还未打开，早已有上海人民报告过政府的该楼秘密机关还没有被破坏，还有更多的特务器械会最后被查清楚的。

    “老奸巨滑”，这四个字对上海的投机商们最确当了。昨夜十时左右，正是负责处理证券大楼的公安局同志忙累得想打瞌睡的时候，看守大楼的警备部队在靠拢大楼的小弄堂里抓出一个小伙子。这小伙子名叫李德祥，住在建国东路三四八号，他原来也是前天上午十时被我们包围在该楼的一个，当时他正打算上电梯，一看苗头勿对，立刻把一布袋钞票，偷偷地塞到那弄堂里，一个三轮车子的帐篷底下，后来把他审查的时候，因为身上没有任何可疑材料，看他又象是个小银贩子的样子，于是释放了他。回去以后，他又奉了主子×××命令，借天黑时窜回来偷回那布袋钞票。
    他那布袋外面写上“大元号”三个字，布袋里竟有七十八万正人民币，据李德祥自己供，他是帮×××做跑街伙计，把钞票送到大楼的二五一号，换金子或银元回去做黑市。所以，如果我们宽大了还隐藏的敌人，就等于对人民犯了罪。
