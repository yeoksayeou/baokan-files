Cotton Aphid Control Methods
　　Zhang Lingyun Zhang Guangxue

　　I. Where do cotton aphids come from?

　　Many people believe that cotton aphids are born spontaneously or emerge from cotton plants. In reality, cotton aphids fly to cotton plants from twenty or thirty kinds of weeds to cause harm. According to a survey conducted near Beiping (Beijing) last year (1948), each violet plant had an average of 135 cotton aphids in late April. Along roadsides or in shady areas, there were an average of 150 violet plants per square zhang, so there were an average of 2,225 cotton aphids per square zhang. Furthermore, each henbit plant could have an average of 3,000 to 4,000 cotton aphids, and each square zhang of grassland had an average of 250 henbit plants, so each square zhang of grassland could have 750,000 to 1,000,000 cotton aphids. Most of the cotton aphids at this time are winged. If they all migrated to one mu of cotton, each cotton plant would have 250 to 330 cotton aphids. Therefore, we can be certain that the harm cotton aphids cause to cotton is actually due to the many weeds that have fostered them in advance.

　　II. Prevention Methods

　　So, which weeds are most likely to allow cotton aphids to breed? According to surveys in the Tianjin and Beijing area, 96 plant species are known, but the most common and important are buckthorn, sow thistle, henbit, motherwort, violet, silverweed, plantain, prickly ash, hibiscus, hollyhock, Pulsatilla chinensis, shepherd's purse, madder, chrysanthemum, wild chrysanthemum, melons, Vitex negundo, Ceratostigma, Acalypha australis, pomegranate, kenaf, and wild watermelon seedlings, among other twenty-odd species. If we can completely eliminate these wild weeds and treat cultivated plants with pesticides, this is the most fundamental way to control cotton aphids. There are three methods:

　　(1) Elimination of egg-laying host plants.

　　The egg stage is a dormant period in the reproduction of cotton aphids. If we can eliminate the weeds where they lay their eggs, we can achieve a complete eradication effect. Cotton aphids lay their eggs from late October to early November and hatch from early to mid-March. Therefore, weeding should be done from late October to early March of the following year. The best time is from late October to mid-November, because the weeds have not died yet and are easier to identify; or from early March to early April, because the cotton aphids have not yet reproduced in large numbers. It is important to collect the weeds that have been removed and burn them or bury them deep in the soil. If weeding is done too late and cotton aphids reproduce excessively, they often produce a large number of winged cotton aphids, and the prevention effect will be greatly reduced.

　　(2) Preventing the migration of winged cotton aphids in the spring.

　　After hatching, cotton aphids initially parasitize on various weeds. From mid-April to mid-May, a large number of winged cotton aphids occur and migrate to cotton plants to cause harm. Therefore, if weeding is done after early April, the weeds with cotton aphids must be immediately collected and buried deep in the soil to prevent the migration of winged aphids.

　　(3) On which weeds do cotton aphids parasitize on the roots?

　　Cotton aphids can parasitize on the stems, leaves, flowers, and fruits of plants. However, according to last year's survey, cotton aphids can also parasitize on the roots of sow thistle, henbit, violet, and motherwort. Most commonly, they parasitize on roots 0.5 to 2 inches deep underground, but sometimes they can also parasitize on roots 4 to 5 inches deep. Therefore, when weeding in the field, the above-mentioned weeds must be removed along with their roots.

　　III. Chemical Control Methods

　　In addition to removing weeds from field borders, ditch banks, and near cotton fields, insecticide should be applied as early as possible as soon as cotton aphids are found in the cotton field. Otherwise, waiting until they have reproduced in large numbers before using pesticides will not only cost more money and labor economically, but the cotton plants will still be damaged. Chemical control methods:

　　(1) Rotenone Powder (Derris Powder) Control Method

　　First, cut three taels of soap into thin slices and place them in a bowl, dissolve them with hot water, and then slowly pour them into a kerosene bucket of water (36 jin of water) and mix, so that the soapy water is completely dissolved in the water in the bucket. Then, use a relatively rough small cloth bag to pack one liang and five qian of rotenone powder, hold the opening tightly with one hand, and hold the other end tightly with the other hand, and rub it back and forth in the bucket until the powder is completely leached out and dissolved in the soapy water. The debris left in the cloth bag can be discarded. The prepared solution can be directly sprayed on the back of cotton leaves where aphids are parasitizing with a sprayer. If there is no sprayer, put the prepared solution in a lighter container (such as a bowl or basin) and place it under the cotton plant. Bend the cotton plants one by one and immerse them in the water for about three seconds, and the cotton aphids can also be killed. If soap is too expensive, soybean flour or soybean milk can be used instead. Rotenone powder that is not completely mixed with soap can still kill about 70% of insects, so it can also be used when necessary.

　　The spraying amount is about three kerosene buckets of solution when ordinary cotton plants have two or three leaves, about four buckets when they have four to six leaves, and five or six buckets of solution when they have seven or more leaves. The first spraying should be done in the early stage of occurrence, and then spray once every ten days for a total of three times. In North China, the first time is usually between late May and early June, the second time is between early and mid-June, and the third time is between late June and early July.

　　The following points should be noted when using rotenone powder:

　　1. The prepared solution can only be used at that time. If it has been stored for too long or left overnight, not only will the efficacy of the drug decompose and fail, but it will also cause phytotoxicity.

　　2. The prepared solution should not be exposed to the sun for a long time. The powder should be placed in a dry place, because a humid place can cause the efficacy of the drug to decompose and deteriorate.

　　3. If the local water quality is too hard, the water can be boiled once and allowed to cool before use. Do not put too much soap in hard water.

　　4. Use soap with as little alkalinity as possible. If the alkalinity is too high, the cotton leaves will turn yellow and cause phytotoxicity.

　　5. The hot water for preparing the soap solution should be cooled before pouring it into the bucket. Do not use hot water to prepare the powder.

　　(2) Tobacco Water Control Method Put three jin of tobacco leaves (or tobacco stems, tobacco stalks. It is best to crush or chop the tobacco stems or stalks first.) in a bucket of water (36 jin of water) and boil it, reducing it to two-thirds, and let it cool overnight. The next morning, filter out the tobacco leaves with a cloth to obtain the original tobacco water solution. Add ten to twenty times the amount of clean water to the prepared original tobacco water solution (add twenty times for tobacco leaves, and ten times for tobacco stems) before use. The usage method is the same as above.

　　If it is not convenient to boil when making tobacco water, the three jin of tobacco leaves or stems can be crushed and put in a cloth bag and put in a bucket of cold water and left overnight. The next day, gently rub the bag with both hands to prevent the tobacco leaf fragments from being exposed. The resulting tobacco water can also be used according to the above method. If two qian of lime can be added, the insecticidal effect can be increased.

　　棉蚜的防治法
    张领耘　张广学
　　一、棉蚜是从那里来的？
    许多认为棉蚜是天生的或从棉花上生出来的。其实棉蚜是从二三十种杂草上飞到棉花上来为害的。根据去年（一九四八）北平附近的调查，在四月末间每株紫花地丁草上，平均有棉蚜一百三十五个，大路旁或树荫处每方丈平均有紫花地丁草一百五十棵，所以每方丈中平均就有棉蚜二千二百二十五个。又在夏至草上每棵平均可有棉蚜三千至四千个，每方丈草地平均有夏至草二百五十棵，所以每方丈草地上可能有棉蚜七十五万至一百万个。这时的棉蚜大多是有翅的，若全部迁移到一亩地的棉花上，每棵棉花上就将有棉蚜二百五十至三百三十个。所以我们可以确定棉蚜的为害棉花，实由于许多杂草预先造成的。
　　二、预防方法
    那么那几种杂草是最容易让棉蚜繁殖呢？根据调查在平津一带已知有九十六种植物，但最普遍最重要的是：鼠李、苦荬菜、夏至草、益母草、紫花地丁、葳陵菜、车前、花椒、木槿、蜀葵、白头翁、荠菜、茜草、菊、野菊、瓜类、牡荆、角蒿、铁苋、石榴、洋麻和野西瓜苗等二十几种。如果我们能把这些野生的杂草铲除干净；栽培的植物用药除治，是防治棉蚜最根本的办法。其法有三：
    （一）下卵寄生植物的铲除。
    卵是棉蚜繁殖中静止的时期，若能把产卵的杂草除净，自可完成除根除的效力。棉蚜在十月底至十一月初下卵，在三月初至三月中孵化。所以除草日期应在十月底到翌年三月初，最好的时间是在十月底到十一月中旬，因为这时杂草还没有死去，比较容易辨认；或是在三月初旬到四月初旬，因为这时棉蚜还没有大量繁殖，应该注意把铲除的杂草要拾回烧掉或埋在深土里。假如除草太迟，棉蚜繁殖过盛，往往大量产生有翅棉蚜，预防的效果就大为减低。
    （二）春季防止有翅棉蚜的迁移。
    棉蚜孵化后，初期仍寄生在各种杂草上，四月中旬至五月中旬便大量发生有翅棉蚜，迁移棉花上为害。所以在四月初旬以后再来铲除杂草，一定要马上将有棉蚜的杂草拾去埋入深土中，以防有翅蚜的飞迁。
    （三）棉蚜寄生在那些杂草的根上？
    棉蚜可以寄生在植物的茎、叶、花和果实上。但根据去年的调查棉蚜还能寄生在苦荬菜、夏至草、紫花地丁及益母草的根上。最常见的是寄生在地面下○·五寸至二寸深的根上，但有时也可以在四至五寸深的根上寄生，所以在田间除草时遇到上述几种杂草一定要连根除去。
　　三、药液防治法
    除了铲除田园地埂，及棉地附近的杂草外，只要发现棉田里有棉蚜发生，应该及早施药除治。否则等待大量繁殖后，再用药防治，不但经济上要多费金钱和劳力；棉株还是受到了损害。药治法：
    （一）鱼藤粉（地力斯粉）防治法
    先将三两肥皂切成薄片放在碗里，用热水溶化，再慢慢倒入一煤油桶的水里（三十六斤水）混合揽拌，使肥皂水完全和桶里的水溶合。然后再用一个比较粗糙的小布袋把一两五钱的鱼藤粉装好，一手握紧开口处，一手握紧另一端，放在桶里来回揉搓，直到药粉完全渗出溶解在肥皂水里为上。布袋里＠下来的杂物可以扔掉。照这样方法做成的药水就可以直接用喷雾器打在棉花叶子背面有蚜虫寄生的地方。如果没有喷雾器时，把配好的药水用比较轻便的容器（如碗盆之类）盛出，放在棉株的下面，把棉株一棵棵地弯折过来浸沾到水里，约沾三秒钟，棉蚜也都可杀死。如果肥皂太贵可用大豆粉或大豆浆之类代替。完全不用肥皂调和的鱼藤粉杀虫率也能在百分之七十左右，所以必要时也可以应用。
    撒布量普通棉花在二三个叶子的时候约需三个煤油桶的药水，四到六个叶子需要四桶左右，七个叶子以上就要五六桶药水。撒布时期第一次宜在发生的初期，其后每隔十天即行喷布一次，共三次即可。在华北普通第一次在五月下旬至六月上旬间，第二次在六月上旬至中旬间，第三次在六月下旬至七月上旬间。
    用鱼藤粉时应该注意下列数项：
    １、已经配好的药液，只能用在当时。如果时间过久或搁置过夜，不但药力分解失效，且会引起药害。
    ２、配好的药液不能久晒。药粉要放在干燥的地方，因为潮湿的地方能使药力分解变质。
    ３、调制时如果当地的水质过硬可以先将水煮沸一次放冷后使用。用硬水肥皂不可放得过多。
    ４、使用的肥皂尽量用碱性小的，如果碱性过大，则棉叶变黄引起药害。
    ５、调制肥皂液的热水宜放冷后注入桶内。禁用热水配制药粉。
    （二）烟草水防治法将三斤烟叶（或烟茎、烟梗。用烟茎或烟梗时最好先行捣碎或切细为佳。）放在一桶水里（三十六斤水）煮沸，熬缩到三分之二时，放置冷处过夜。翌晨用布将烟叶滤去，便是烟草水的原液。将做好的烟草水的原液再加清水十倍到二十倍（烟叶的加二十倍，烟茎的加十倍）即可使用。用法和上法相同。
    制烟草水如煮沸不方便时，可先将三斤烟叶或烟茎弄碎用布口袋装好放入一桶的冷水里，搁置一昼夜。翌日再将口袋用双手轻轻揉搓，以不使烟叶碎屑露出为度。所得的烟草水，亦可照以上方法使用。如果能放入二钱的石灰，更能增加杀虫的效果。
