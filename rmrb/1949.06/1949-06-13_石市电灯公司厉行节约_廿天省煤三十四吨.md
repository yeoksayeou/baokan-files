　　Saving 34 Tons of Coal in 20 Days

[Shijiazhuang Electric News] The Shijiazhuang Electricity Company, in response to the call of the North China Central Bureau and the Municipal Party Committee, has improved its management and practiced thrift, achieving considerable success. The Second Power Plant alone saved 34 tons of coal in 20 days. June's main competition goal is to "strictly implement thrift" and improve work efficiency. In terms of fuel, the lowest coal consumption rate of each plant in May is set as the competition standard for this month; in terms of electricity consumption, attention is paid to the adjustment of power machines, and the non-essential use of power is strictly prohibited. In terms of oil consumption, each plant should use more electric pumps and fewer steam pumps. In terms of materials, more waste materials, old materials, and substitutes should be utilized.

　　石市电灯公司厉行节约
  　廿天省煤三十四吨
    【石家庄电】石市电灯公司响应华北中央局和市委的号召，改进经营管理，厉行节约，现已获不少成绩。只第二发电厂二十天中就节省燃煤三十四吨。六月份更以“严格实行节约，”提高工作效率为竞赛主要目标之一。燃料方面，以五月份各厂最低燃煤率定为本月竞赛标准；用电方面，注意动力机的调节，严格禁止非必要的使用动力。用油方面，各厂要多用电泵，少用汽泵。材料方面，要更多利用废料、旧料和代用品。
