    I. Czechoslovakia's Rise and Fall

    Czechoslovakia resembles a recumbent heart of Europe, narrow from north to south and long from east to west. It borders the Soviet Union, Hungary, Austria, Germany, and Poland from east, south, west to north respectively. It covers an area of 128,000 square kilometers, less than that of Anhui Province in China. After the expulsion of more than three million Germans from the country after the war, the population was 12.2 million (1946); 90 percent of whom are Czechs and Slovaks, both of Slavic origin. The former mainly live in Bohemia in the west and Moravia in the center; the latter mainly live in Slovakia in the east.

    Czechoslovakia originally emerged from the shackles of the disintegrated Austro-Hungarian Empire after the First World War. When the Czech bourgeoisie had not even considered establishing an independent state, the Czech working class, under the influence of the great Russian October Socialist Revolution, issued a declaration demanding national independence in January 1918, followed by strikes and demonstrations to launch a revolutionary wave. On October 14, a general strike broke out in Bohemia and Moravia, and the people in many places automatically rose up to declare the independence of the country. Two weeks later, the Czechoslovak Republic was born. However, the Czech bourgeoisie, relying on the support of American, British, and French imperialism, usurped the fruits of the revolution, seized political power, formed a bourgeois state, and turned to suppressing the working people. "The fate and wealth of the country were in the hands of a handful of capitalists and landlords. The foreign policy was basically dependent on those Western countries that sold out Czechoslovakia at the critical moment in Munich" (Gottwald). Therefore, although Czechoslovakia at that time had a well-developed industry (42 percent of the residents were engaged in industrial production), and although it had a well-equipped army of 1.25 million, it still could not save the people from the pain of national subjugation. This happened in March 1939.

    On May 9, 1945, the people of Prague, Czechoslovakia, held an uprising. At that time, the American army had reached Pilsen, 80 kilometers west of Prague, but deliberately sat idly by while the people of Prague were immersed in blood, so it stayed put. Only with the help of the Soviet army, which rushed from Berlin and Dresden from afar, did the Prague uprising achieve victory.

    II. Political Reform in Czechoslovakia

    After the liberation of Czechoslovakia, the state power was completely transferred to the National Front led by the vanguard of the working class, the Communist Party. The National Front was formed during the struggle against the German fascist occupiers. At that time, eight political parties participated in this democratic alliance, four of which were Czech (Communist Party, Social Democratic Party, National Socialist Party, and Catholic People's Party), and the other four were Slovak (Communist Party, Labor Party, Democratic Party, and Freedom Party). The National Front not only included various political parties, but also relied on powerful mass organizations: trade unions, farmers' associations, women's federations, youth federations, and cooperative federations.

    The Communist Party of Czechoslovakia put forward the Kosice Program for the democratization of the national economy in May 1945. This first program on which the national people's democratic system was based was recognized by all parties participating in the National Front at that time. This program brought about tremendous changes in all aspects of national political and economic life.

    The local, district, and state national committees that emerged during the national liberation struggle replaced the old district and state governor system and became formal organs of people's power. The highest state power organ is the unicameral National Assembly and the government responsible to the National Assembly. The National Assembly is elected every four years. The first election after the war was held on May 26, 1946, and the Communist Party won the most votes, accounting for 36 percent. The government led by the Communist Party guaranteed the implementation of the Kosice Program.

    III. Economic Reform in Czechoslovakia

    For Czechoslovakia, which is industrialized and concentrated, the order on the nationalization of large industries and banks promulgated on October 24, 1945, was of particular significance. Prior to this, factories employing 100 to 5,000 or more workers concentrated 83.8 percent of the total factory workers in the country. Private monopoly capital controlled the lifeline of the national economy. The nationalization decree took all the banks and mining, power, metallurgy, and munitions industries from the hands of the big bourgeoisie and foreign capitalists and put them under the control of the people's state. The factories and enterprises belonging to German and Hungarian capitalists and Czech traitors were all confiscated. Other nationalized factories and enterprises were issued "state-owned economic fund" bonds as compensation. The scope of nationalization included 75 percent of the total industrial output and 66 percent of the employees. The nationalization of large industries and banks not only guaranteed the leading role of the state-owned economy in the national economy, but also made the implementation of economic plans possible.

    Czechoslovakia is an industrial country, but the population engaged in agriculture still accounts for more than one-third of the country's population. In 1930, 23 percent of the country's arable land belonged to more than one million poor farmers with less than five hectares of land; 20 percent belonged to 240,000 middle farmers with between five and twenty hectares of land; 14 percent belonged to 57,000 rich farmers with between twenty and fifty hectares of land; and the remaining approximately 43 percent belonged to landlords who owned more than fifty hectares of land, accounting for only 1 percent of all landowners; 660,000 agricultural workers farmed for landlords and rich farmers. After liberation, according to the land reform decrees of February 27 and June 21, 1945, the land of German landlords and rich farmers, as well as traitors and war criminals, was confiscated. Approximately 1.7 million hectares of land were distributed to 170,000 farmers, mainly hired and poor farmers. Later, according to the revised land reform law, hired and poor farmers were allocated another 867,000 hectares of land. At the same time, the state stipulated that all agricultural products should be purchased from farmers by state-owned companies in cooperation with agricultural cooperatives at graded prices, paying higher prices to poor and middle farmers and lower prices to landlords and rich farmers. In addition, convenience was given to poor and middle farmers in terms of joining cooperatives, loans, the implementation of a unified agricultural tax, and the establishment of machine stations. The people's democratic government, with the help of these policies, won over the laboring farmers, who were greatly influenced by the reactionaries before the war, thus consolidating the worker-peasant alliance.

    However, only enterprises employing more than 200 to 500 people were confiscated according to the first industrial nationalization decree. Capitalists who lost their positions in banks and large enterprises turned to wholesale trade, foreign trade, light industry and other economic sectors that were not within the scope of nationalization to exploit loopholes. After the implementation of the first land reform decree, there were still 13,000 landlord estates owning 1.45 million hectares of land; and 500,000 farmers had only one to five hectares of land, and 200,000 farmers had only five to ten hectares of land. These bourgeois and landlord forces and their agents entrenched in the leading organs of the National Socialist Party, the Catholic People's Party, and the Slovak Democratic Party attempted to obstruct the thorough implementation of the Kosice Program and usurp political power. This is the background of the desperate struggle of the reactionaries in the February 1948 event.

    Under the power of the workers and peasants, the government crisis caused by the resignation of twelve right-wing ministers on February 20, 1948, was overcome within five days. The government, the National Assembly, and the National Front were consolidated by purging the running dogs of American and British imperialism. The new Gottwald government, in accordance with the demands of the workers and peasants, further nationalized enterprises employing more than 50 people; and requisitioned private land of more than 50 hectares. As a result, the nationalized industry increased to 95 percent of the total industry (as of December 1948). In this way, another 1,033,000 hectares of land were distributed to landless and land-poor farmers (as of May 1948). Together with the previous ones, landless and land-poor farmers received a total of more than 3.5 million hectares of land (equivalent to more than 56 million mu).

    IV. Planned Economy in Czechoslovakia

    These major reforms laid a solid foundation for a planned economy. At the beginning of 1946, the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia put forward the famous "National Economic Recovery and Development Plan from 1947 to 1948." It stipulated that by the end of 1948, the production level should exceed the pre-occupation production level of 1937 by 10 percent. This goal has been achieved as scheduled. This makes Czechoslovakia one of the ten industrial countries in the world today (if calculated by population ratio, it is the fifth industrial country in the world). A five-year plan began in 1949. The total investment in this plan is 336 billion crowns (Czech currency), which is almost five times the total investment in the two-year plan. It stipulates that when the entire plan is completed, industrial production will increase by 57 percent compared with 1948, agricultural production will increase by 15 percent compared with 1948, and the people's living standards will increase by 60 percent compared with before the war. "The Five-Year Plan is a major contribution to Czechoslovakia's development towards socialism. The main reason is that it will strengthen the already nationalized industry and increase the electrification and mechanization of agriculture. In this way, a more progressive socialized mode of production is laid for the national economy in this regard. The remaining capitalist components will be gradually eliminated from all sectors of the national economy" (Five-Year Plan Bill).

    V. Bastion of New Democracy

    The achievements made by the people of Czechoslovakia in the past four years have been consolidated in the form of a constitution in the "Victory New Constitution" passed on May 9, 1948. The will of the people of Czechoslovakia was not only expressed in the new constitution, but also in the election of the National Assembly on May 30, 1948. In this general election after the promulgation of the new constitution, the National Front led by Czechoslovakia won 89.2 percent of the votes, occupying 293 seats in the 300 seats of the National Assembly. Among them, unified members of the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia accounted for 237 seats.

    One of the major guarantees for Czechoslovakia's safe independence and prosperous development is its close alliance with the Soviet Union and other people's democratic countries in Eastern Europe. It has bilateral treaties of friendship, cooperation, and mutual assistance with them. Czechoslovakia is the most prominent barrier for the new democratic countries in Eastern Europe at the western end. Czechoslovakia, which is successfully implementing a planned economy with the assistance of the Soviet Union, plays a major role in the new democratic economic system in Eastern Europe, which is immune to the threat of capitalist crises, due to its developed industry, especially the machinery manufacturing industry.

    VI. The Communist Party of Czechoslovakia

    All the brilliant achievements of the people of Czechoslovakia have been achieved under the leadership of the Communist Party. The Communist Party enjoys extremely high prestige among the people. On the eve of the February 1948 event, there were 1.3 million party members. On the eve of the May general election of the same year, there were 2 million party members. After merging with the Social Democratic Party into the unified Communist Party of Czechoslovakia on June 27 of the same year, there were a total of 2.5 million party members. In order to consolidate the party, the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia held a comprehensive party rectification at the end of 1946 and the beginning of 1947. In October 1948, a large-scale review of party members was started based on whether they served the people. This is a necessary step after the party has developed in large numbers. The chairman of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia is Gottwald, who is the beloved head of state, the president.

    In this way, under the leadership of the Communist Party and on the solid foundation of the worker-peasant alliance, Czechoslovakia is completing the cause of people's democracy and moving towards the road of socialism.

　　新民主主义的捷克
    李  何
    一、兴亡盛衰话捷克
    捷克斯洛伐克好象横卧着的欧洲心脏，南北窄而东西长。自东、南、西至北、分别与苏联、匈牙利、奥地利、德国以及波兰为界。面积凡十二万八千方公里，不及我国一个安徽省大。战后人口在迁走境内三百多万德国人以后，计有一千二百万人（一九四六年）；其中百分之九十为捷克民族与斯洛伐克民族，两者都是斯拉夫人种。前者主要居住在西部的波希米亚和中部的摩拉维亚；后者主要居住在东部的斯洛伐克。
    捷克斯洛伐克原是第一次世界大战之后摆脱瓦解了的奥匈帝国底羁绊而产生的。当捷克资产阶级还没有设想到成立独立的国家时，捷克工人阶级在伟大的俄国十月社会主义革命的影响之下，于一九一八年一月就发表了要求民族独立的宣言，接着以罢工、示威来掀起革命浪潮。至十月十四日，波希米亚和摩达维亚发生了总罢工，许多地方的人民自动起来宣布国家的独立。两周后，捷克斯洛伐克共和国诞生了。然而，捷克资产阶级依靠美英法帝国主义的支持，却篡夺了革命果实，霸占了政权，组成了资产阶级的国家，转而镇压劳动人民。“国家的命运和财富，都掌握在屈指可数的几个资本家和地主手里。外交政策基本上是仰赖那些在慕尼黑紧要关头出卖了捷克的西方国家”（哥特瓦尔德）。因此，当时捷克斯洛伐克虽然有素称发达的工业（百分之四十二居民从事工业生产），虽然有装备优良的军队一百二十五万，仍不能使人民免受亡国的惨痛。这是一九三九年三月的事情。
    一九四五年五月九日，捷克布拉格人民举行起义。当时美军已抵达布拉格以西八十公里的比尔森，但蓄意坐视布拉格人民沉没在血泊里，因而按兵不救。只有在苏军从柏林和德累斯登远道驰援之下，布拉格的起义才获得了胜利。
    二、捷克的政治改革
    捷克斯洛伐克解放之后，国家政权完全转到了工人阶级先锋队共产党所领导的民族阵线手里。民族阵线是在抵抗德国法西斯占领者的斗争时期组成的。当时参加这个民主联盟的政党有八个，其中四个是捷克的（共产党、社会民主党、民族社会党和天主教人民党），另外四个是斯洛伐克的（共产党、劳动党、民主党和自由党）。民族战线不仅包括各个政党，同时它还依靠着强大的群众性组织：职工会、农民协会、妇女联合会、青年联合会、合作社联合会。
    捷克斯洛伐克共产党于一九四五年五月提出了国家经济民主化的科息斯纲领。这一个全国人民民主制度据以建立的第一个纲领，当时是得到参加民族阵线的一切政党的承认的。这一个纲领使全国政治和经济生活各方面起了巨大的变化。
    民族解放斗争时期出现的地方、区、州国民委员会，代替了旧有的区长、州长制度，成为正式的人民政权机关。国家的最高权力机关是一院制的国民议会和对国民议会负责的政府。国民议会每四年选举一次，战后第一次选举于一九四六年五月二十六日举行，共产党得票最多，占百分之三十六。共产党领导的政府，保证了科息斯纲领的实施。
    三、捷克的经济改革
    对于工业既发达又集中的捷克斯洛伐克说来，一九四五年十月二十四日颁布的大工业和银行国有化的命令，具有特别重大的意义。在这以前，全国雇佣工人在百人至五千人以上的工厂集中了全部工厂工人总数的百分之八十三·八。私人独占资本控制着国家经济命脉。国有化法令一举而将全国的银行和采矿、动力、冶金、军火、化学等工业，从大资产阶级和外国资本家手里收归人民的国家掌握。属于德匈资本家和捷叛国分子的工厂企业，一律没收。其他被国有化的工厂企业，则发给“国营经济基金”债券，作为补偿。国有化范围包括了全部工业的百分之七十五的生产量和百分之六十六的职工。大工业和银行国有化，不仅保证了国营经济在国民经济中的领导作用，而且使经济计划的实施成为可能。
    捷克斯洛伐克是个工业国，但从事农业的人口仍占全国人口的三分之一以上。在一九三○年，全国耕地百分之二十三属于一百多万户土地不足五公顷的贫农；百分之二十属于二十四万户土地在五至二十公顷之间的中农；百分之十四属于五万七千户土地在二十至五十公顷之间的富农；其余约百分之四十三都属于总数在全体土地所有者中仅占百分之一的、拥有土地五十公顷以上的地主；有六十六万农业工人给地主富农种地。解放之后，根据一九四五年二月廿七日和六月廿一日的土地改革法令，没收了德国地主富农以及叛国者和战犯的土地。约有一百七十万公顷土地分给了以雇农贫农为主的十七万户农民。后来，按照土地改革修正法，雇农贫农又分得了八十六万七千公顷土地。同时，国家规定一切农产品均由国营公司协同农业合作社以级差价格，向农民购买，付给贫农中农较高的价格，付给地主富农较低的价格。此外，在加入合作社，贷款，施行统一农业税和设立机器站方面，都给贫农中农以便利。人民民主政权借助于这些政策，把战前受反动派影响颇大的劳动农民争取到自己方面来，从而巩固了工农联盟。
    但是，按照第一次工业国有化法令被没收的，仅限于雇用二百人至五百人以上的企业。在银行和大企业中失去阵地的资本家，便转向不在国有化范围之内的批发贸易、对外贸易、轻工业等经济部门钻空子。第一次土地改革法令实行之后，仍有一万三千座地主田庄，拥有土地一百四十五万公顷；还有五十万户农民只有土地在一至五公顷之间，二十万户农民只有上土地在五至十公顷之间。这些资产阶级和地主势力及其盘据在民族社会党、天主教人民党和斯洛伐克民主党的领导机关中的代理人，妄图阻挠科息斯纲领的彻底实施和篡夺政权。这就是一九四八年二月事件中反动派绝望挣扎的背景。
    在工农群众的威力下，一九四八年二月二十日由十二个右翼部长的辞职所造成的政府危机，在五天之内便克服了。政府、国民议会和民族阵线因为清洗了美英帝国主义走狗而巩固起来。哥特瓦尔德新政府根据工农大众的要求，进一步把雇用五十人以上的企业收归国有；并征购五十公顷以上的私有土地。这样，使得国有化的工业提高到全部工业的百分之九十五（截至一九四八年十二月）。这样，又有一百零三万三千公顷土地分配给无地少地农民（截至一九四八年五月）。连同以前，无地少地农民共获得土地三百五十余万公顷（合五千六百余万华亩）。
    四、捷克的计划经济
    这些重大的改革，为计划经济打下了坚固的基础。一九四六年初，捷克斯洛伐克共产党提出了有名的“一九四七年到一九四八年国民经济复兴与发展计划”。它规定到一九四八年底，生产水平要超过被占领前一九三七年生产水平百分之十。这个目标已如期实现了。这使捷克斯洛伐克成为现今世界十个工业国之一（如以人口比例计算，则为世界第五工业国）。一九四九年开始了一个五年计划，此一计划，投资总额为三千三百六十亿克郎（捷币），几达两年计划中投资总额的五倍。它规定在全部计划完成时，工业生产量将比一九四八年提高百分之五十七，农业生产量将比一九四八年提高百分之十五，人民生活水平将比战前提高百分之六十。“五年计划乃是捷克斯洛伐克向社会主义发展的一个重大贡献。主要的因为它将加强业已国有化的工业，并将增加农业的电气化和机械化。这样，为国民经济奠定了在这方面更进步的社会化生产方式的基础。残余的资本主义成份将逐渐从国民经济所有部门中消灭掉”（五年计划法案）。
    五、新民主主义的堡垒
    捷克斯洛伐克人民四年来所获得的成就，在一九四八年五月九日通过的“胜利新宪法”中，以宪法的形式巩固起来了。捷克斯洛伐克人民的意志，不仅在新宪法上，而且在一九四八年五月三十日国民议会的选举上，作了最强烈的表露。在这次新宪法颁布后的大选中，捷克斯洛伐克所领导的民族阵线得票百分之八十九·二，在国民议会三百议席中占二百九十三席。其中统一的捷克斯洛伐克共产党议员占二百三十七席。
    捷克斯洛伐克安全独立和繁荣发展的重大保证之一，是它与苏联，与东欧其他人民民主国家的亲密联盟。它与它们之间缔结有双边的友好合作互助条约。捷克斯洛伐克是东欧新民主国家在西端最突出的屏障。在苏联援助之下顺利实施计划经济的捷克斯洛伐克，由于它的工业特别是机器制造业的发达，对于免受资本主义危机威胁的东欧新民主经济体系，起着重大的作用。
    六、捷克的共产党
    捷克斯洛伐克人民的所有的辉煌成绩，都是在共产党领导之下获得的。捷共在人民中享有极高的威信。一九四八年二月事件前夕，有党员一百三十万人。同年五月大选前夕，有党员二百万人。同年六月二十七日与社会民主党合并为统一的捷克斯洛伐克共产党之后，共有党员二百五十万人。为了巩固党，一九四六年底至一九四七年初，捷共曾举行了全面的整党。一九四八年十月，又开始了以是否为人民服务为标准，大规模地审查党员。这是党在大量发展以后的必要步骤。捷共中央委员会的主席是哥特瓦尔德，他是人民所爱戴的国家元首——总统。
    捷克斯洛伐克就是这样在共产党的领导之下，在工农联盟的巩固的基础之上，完成着人民民主的事业，向着社会主义的道路迈进。
