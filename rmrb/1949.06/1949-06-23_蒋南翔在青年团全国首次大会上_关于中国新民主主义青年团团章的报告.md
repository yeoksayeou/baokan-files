    Jiang Nanxiang's Report on the Constitution of the China New Democratic Youth League at the First National Congress of the Youth League
    (April 13, 1949)
    I. Explanation of Certain Revisions to the Draft Constitution of the New Democratic Youth League of China
    The Draft Constitution of the China New Democratic Youth League, announced by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China on New Year's Day this year, is correct and concise, and serves as the organizational guiding principle for the national youth league building work during this period. The version we are now formally submitting to the congress for discussion and adoption is basically the same as this draft constitution. However, due to the many new experiences in youth league building work during this period, and the rapid development of the revolutionary situation, it is necessary to make certain additions and revisions to the original draft constitution based on these new circumstances. Such revisions will be inevitable in the future, because after a considerable period, with the continued development of the work and the situation, new revisions of the constitution will be necessary to adapt the organizational regulations of the Youth League to the tasks and actual conditions of the struggle at that time. But in any case, the basic spirit of the constitution – ensuring that the Youth League becomes a revolutionary school that educates young people with Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, ensuring the complete trust of all Youth League members and the vast number of advanced young people in the Communist Party, and becoming the reserve force and capable assistant of the Communist Party – will remain unchanged.
    The following modifications to the original draft constitution require special explanation:
    (1) Regarding Chapter I, General Principles:
    The entire text of Article 3 of the original draft constitution is removed. – Article 3 stipulates the four basic tasks of the Youth League. Now that a more complete program of work has been formulated separately, the provisions on the central work are no longer included in the constitution.
    (2) Regarding Chapter II, Members:
    (A) Regarding joining the Youth League, the following four revisions have been made:
    (1) The provision that "recommendation by a mass meeting may obviate the need for an introducer" has been removed. – Because if there is no reliable and responsible introducer for joining the League, and a recommendation is made by a mass meeting without a fixed organizational form, there may be phenomena such as forced mobilization or carelessness. Admission to the League must be based on the individual's conscious willingness and after careful individual understanding and examination.
    (2) An addition is made that formal members of the Chinese Communist Party can serve as introducers for joining the Youth League. – This not only demonstrates the close relationship between the Youth League and the Communist Party, but also increases the Communist Party's responsibility for leading the Youth League, which can better help the development of the Youth League. At present, the work of building the League has just begun. In many cities and rural areas, especially in newly developed areas and in the army, there are only party organizations and no League organizations. It is necessary to rely on the Party to open up and develop the work of the Youth League.
    (3) An addition is made that the basic-level organization of the Young Pioneers can serve as an introducer for the Young Pioneers of its own organizational unit. – Because the Young Pioneers is a youth organization directly led by the Youth League, it can and should become the reserve force of the Youth League. The basic-level organization of the Young Pioneers is best able to understand the lifestyle, work style, and ideological awareness of the Young Pioneers. Therefore, the basic-level organizations of the Young Pioneers directly led by the Youth League can be entrusted as introducers for their outstanding Young Pioneers to join the League. This not only demonstrates the close relationship between the Youth League and the Young Pioneers, but also increases the responsibility of the Young Pioneers to send outstanding members over the age of fourteen to join the Youth League, which can further contribute to the consolidation and development of the Youth League.

    蒋南翔在青年团全国首次大会上
    关于中国新民主主义青年团团章的报告
    （一九四九年四月十三日）
    一、关于新民主主义青年团团章草案底某些修改的说明
    中共中央在今年元旦所公布的中国新民主主义青年团团章草案正确扼要，是这一时期来全国建团工作的组织上的指导方针。现在我们正式提交大会讨论和采纳的，基本上也就是采取了这一个团章草案。只是由于这一时期来在建团工作中有许多新的经验，同时革命形势迅速发展，一日千里，因此我们还必须根据这种新的情况而对原来的团章草案作某些增添和修改。这种修改就在以后也还不可避免，因为在相当时期以后，跟着工作和形势的继续发展，为了使青年团的组织章程和那时的斗争任务与实际状况相适应，团章底新的修改，又将成为必要。但无论如何，团章的基本精神——保证青年团成为以马列主义、毛泽东思想教育青年的革命学校，保证全体青年团员及广大先进青年对于共产党的完全信任，成为共产党的后备军与得力助手——这将始终不变。
    对于原来团章草案所作的若干修改，需要特别加以说明的有如下各项：
    （一）关于第一章总则：
    原来团章草案的第三条全文取销。——第三条规定有青年团的四项基本工作，现在因为已另外单独制定了更完整的工作纲领，故关于中心工作的规定，不再在团章中列入。
    （二）关于第二章团员：
    （甲）关于团员入团，现在作了下列四项修改：
    （１）取销了“经过群众会议推荐可以不要介绍人”的规定。——因为入团如无确实的负责介绍人，而由并无固定组织形式的群众会议推荐，有时群众起哄，可能产生强迫动员或马虎疏忽等现象。吸收团员入团，必须出于本人自觉自愿，并经过仔细的个别了解与审查。
    （２）增加了中共正式党员可以做为青年团入团介绍人一项。——这样不但表明了青年团和共产党的亲密关系，并且加重了共产党对青年团的领导责任，可以更好的帮助青年团的发展。现在建团工作刚在开始，在许多城市和农村中，特别在新发展地区及军队中，都还只有党的组织，而无团的组织，必须依靠党来开辟和开展青年团的工作。
    （３）增加了少先队的基层组织可以作为本组织单位的少先队员的入团介绍人一项。——因少先队是青年团直接领导下的少年组织，它可以而且应该成为青年团的后备队伍。少先队员的生活作风及思想觉悟程度等，少先队的基层组织，也最能熟悉了解。所以由青年团所直接领导的少先队底基层组织，可以被委托作为其优秀的少先队员底入团介绍人。这样不但表明了青年团和少先队的密切关系，而且加重了少先队需要输送年满十四岁以上优秀队员参加青年团的责任，可以更有助于青年团的巩固和发展。            （未完）
