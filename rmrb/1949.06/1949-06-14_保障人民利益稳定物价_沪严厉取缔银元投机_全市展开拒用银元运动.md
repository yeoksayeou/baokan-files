Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, June 13th: To safeguard the interests of the people, stabilize prices, and crack down on the small number of illegal merchants and remnants of the Kuomintang bandits who were manipulating the silver dollar black market and disrupting the financial system, the Shanghai Military Control Commission and the People's Government, after careful investigation, dispatched personnel on the 10th to search the Securities Building, where silver dollar speculators were concentrated. Over a hundred silver dollar speculators with solid evidence of their crimes were apprehended. The Shanghai Public Security Bureau dispatched personnel to stop street-level silver dollar hawkers, advising and educating them to change professions. The people of the city also launched a movement to refuse the use of silver dollars. Students from various schools and people's organizations formed a propaganda team of 15,000 people to conduct street campaigns. At the same time, the Shanghai branch of the People's Bank of China is actively preparing for two operations: redeeming silver dollars and offering savings accounts with value guaranteed, to thwart the enemy's conspiracy to disrupt the financial system by manipulating silver dollars. At the beginning of Shanghai's liberation, the Military Control Commission and the People's Government vigorously redeemed the fake gold yuan notes and organized the transport of essential goods such as grain and coal into Shanghai, which had initially stabilized prices. However, lurking Kuomintang bandits and a few illegal merchants used the black market to buy up silver dollars, affecting the rise of general prices, which greatly impacted the people's lives. The people of the city were outraged and demanded that the People's Government severely crack down on these activities. On the 5th, the Shanghai Liberation Daily published an editorial entitled "Speculators Disrupting the Financial System and Manipulating Silver Dollars, Quickly Awaken!" warning the lawless elements to wake up as soon as possible, stop their criminal activities, and transfer their funds to legitimate industrial and commercial enterprises. However, these criminals showed no remorse and continued to carry out silver dollar black market activities on a large scale. Therefore, the Military Control Commission and the People's Government took the above-mentioned strict measures and will impose necessary punishments on the speculators who have been apprehended.

Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, June 13th: The Shanghai People's Government has cracked a case of remaining Kuomintang bandits counterfeiting RMB. The criminals have been arrested by the Shanghai Municipal Public Security Bureau. Those arrested include Weng Zihe, director of Jinshan Printing Factory, Weng Wenjing, accountant, Zhou Yueying and Zhou Xiayun, harborers, and Li Ming, distributor. According to the confessions of the criminals: after the People's Liberation Army crossed the river, the Kuomintang bandits secretly ordered the rapid and massive printing of counterfeit RMB. The criminals then printed 106.7 million yuan of counterfeit RMB in three days and three nights from May 11th to 13th under the armed protection of the bandit army, and transported it out on military trucks on the 14th. After the liberation of Shanghai, the criminals continued to implement the evil distribution plan while also erasing printing plates, trying to eliminate traces. When the case was cracked, two printing plates on three printing machines had not yet been erased, and the cut ticket edges were scattered all over the ground. The case is currently being processed.

　　保障人民利益稳定物价
  　沪严厉取缔银元投机
    全市展开拒用银元运动
    【新华社上海十三日电】上海市军管会及人民政府为保障人民利益，稳定物价，打击操纵银元黑市扰乱金融的少数不法奸商和国民党残余匪徒，经缜密调查后，已于十日派员搜查了银元投机商集中的证券大楼，查获证据确凿的银元投机奸徒达百余人。对街头活动的银元小贩，市公安局则派员加以制止，并予以劝告和教育，使之改业。全市人民也展开了拒用银元运动，各校学生和人民团体组织了共有一万五千人的宣传队，在街头进行宣传。同时人民银行上海分行则积极筹办收兑银元和折实储蓄两项业务，以粉碎敌操纵银元扰乱金融的阴谋。沪市解放之初，军管会及人民政府曾大力收兑伪金圆券，和组织粮、煤等必需品运入沪市，物价本属稳定。潜伏的国民党匪徒及少数不法奸商，竟以黑市收买银元作崇，影响一般物价上涨，对人民生活影响极大。全市人民无不愤怒，纷纷要求人民政府严加取缔。上海解放日报于五日以“扰乱金融操纵银元的投机者赶快觉悟”为题发表社论，警告不法之徒及早觉悟，停止其犯罪行为，将资金转入正当的工商事业。但这些奸徒竟无悔祸之心，仍大肆进行银元黑市活动。故军管会与人民政府乃采取了上述严厉措施，并将对已查获的投机奸徒予以必要的惩处。
    【新华社上海十三日电】上海人民政府破获残余国民党匪帮假造人民币案。各犯已先后经沪市人民政府公安局缉拿归案。计缉获金山印刷厂厂长翁滋和、管帐翁文靖、窝主周月英、周霞云、发行员黎明等人。据该犯等供稿：解放军过江后，国民党匪帮即密令迅速大量印制伪造人民币。该犯等即于五月十一日至十三日三天三夜中在匪军武装保护下赶印伪造人民币一亿零六千七百万元，并于十四日以军用卡车运出。沪市解放后，该犯等一面继续执行罪恶的发行计划，一面擦印胶版，图消除痕迹。当该案破获时，三部印券机上有两块胶版尚未擦印，切下来的票边还撒满地上。现该案正处理中。
