　　The Masses Approve of the New "Foreign Film"
　　　　　　　　　　　　　　Zhang Yingxue

　　The new "foreign film" was created by art workers of the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region Cultural Association in 1944. It is completely different from the old "foreign film" (peep show). There is no similarity in form or content. It is a completely new creation of an art form. The so-called new "foreign film" is actually a large-format comic strip, with added poetry (lyrics) and music, and performed on a frame resembling a small stage. The combination of painting, poetry, and music enhances their respective effects. Where the lyrics are abstract, the pictures provide concrete images; where the pictures are insufficient, the lyrics can narrate. Thus, it can be said to be complete with sound and color. Therefore, the new "foreign film," in a sense, is also a comprehensive art form. The common people call it "small opera," and say, "The new 'foreign film' exposes brains quickly" (meaning it's easy to understand). "It's clearer than listening to opera, and every picture has a new scene."

　　The Yan'an Cultural Association's new "foreign film" toured the counties in the Yan'an Special District at the time. The content of the "foreign film" mainly reflected the production movement and promoted the breaking of superstitions. Because the masses truly welcomed it, it took root among the masses in a very short time. I remember that the Zichang County People's Education Center and other propaganda departments imitated the Cultural Association's new "foreign film," using it extensively for propaganda and educating the masses at temple fairs and market days.

　　After the Japanese surrender, a group of art workers in Yan'an spent several months collectively creating a set of "Zhao Tianshun's Emancipation" "foreign films," painted in twenty-four oil paintings. They also invited three comrades from the orchestral band to accompany the performance. Old Xu (Xu Teli) and some responsible leaders gave the new "foreign film" much praise and encouragement, unanimously believing that "the 'foreign film' has a future, and the realm of art has been expanded." At that time, in order to cooperate with the land reform in the Longdong Special District, the "foreign film" was performed there for more than a month, and the masses were deeply impressed by it. The story and characters in the "foreign film" were very familiar to the masses. The lyrics and songs were very popular among primary school students. People's Education Centers and schools in several counties automatically imitated the new "foreign film," each making a set with the same content. The new "foreign film" quickly took root in the Longdong Special District. In the same year, when the Literary and Art Office transferred to work in the Suide Special District, the new "foreign film" received the same love and welcome from the masses.

　　In 1946, the heroes' congress of the Jin-Hebei-Lu-Yu Border Region was held, and the art workers there also used new "foreign films" in their activities. They spent more than four months collectively creating a set of "Land Returned to the Home," totaling fifty-five pictures. It was themed around the oppression and exploitation of tenant Wang Dong'er's family by landlord Wang Santai, and the content was more complex than before. The authors were all participants in the mass movement and had rich life experiences. They collectively discussed the script, composition, and color. The personalities, identities, and appearances of the characters were all selected from real models among the masses. The painting style was extremely realistic. Such a long comic strip required three hours to perform, which was a first for "foreign film" activities.

　　"Land Returned to the Home" was performed for more than a month in the eighth and ninth districts of Wu'an County. The masses reflected, "This is like watching a new opera! The songs are all about our own affairs." Some said, "Watching 'foreign films' can open your mind and teach you more; it's good to watch and saves money." Others said, "The 'foreign film' can be heard clearly. The people are painted to life; they are about to walk off the paper, and it's just like the real thing..." Therefore, the mood of the masses was very high wherever it went, and they watched it from beginning to end in one breath, even watching it a second or third time. Cadres also loved the new "foreign film" equally. During the Yetao land conference, more than a thousand cadres all requested to see the "foreign film."

　　Last autumn, the "foreign film" followed some comrades from the People's Art Workshop into Shijiazhuang. In order to cooperate with urban propaganda work, we revived the "foreign film." We painted short pieces such as "Carry the Revolution Through to the End," "Model Family for Joining the Army," and "New Soldier's Life." After performing in the suburban areas of the city, we returned to the city and gave two trial performances on Garden Street. The result was very good, and workers, students, and citizens were particularly welcome. Then we performed many more times in a row. The films such as "Carry the Revolution Through to the End" were performed on Garden Street for a month and three days. Tickets cost 300 yuan, with two shows a day, and every show was full. Workers also liked to watch "foreign films," and factories in Shijiazhuang all invited the new "foreign film" to perform. Some large factories even performed several times. After watching films such as "Carry the Revolution Through to the End" and "Land Returned to the Home," workers said, "This is more interesting than attending a political class." Some said, "Watching 'Carry the Revolution Through to the End' is like reading a modern revolutionary history." "Chiang Kai-shek is more poisonous than a viper." Some said, "In the future, 'foreign films' should also paint about us workers." ... Soon after our "foreign films" were performed in Shijiazhuang, workers from the Electric Light Company, the Educational Institution, the First Middle School, the First District Government, and the Linqing People's Education Center all started making "foreign films." Some did it relatively well, and some were more rudimentary. Some painted their own new films, and some copied our original films as a set. Therefore, the new "foreign film" quickly took root in the city. The position is getting bigger and bigger every day.

### 群众批准了新洋片

　　群众批准了新洋片
    张映雪
    新洋片是民卅三年陕甘宁边区文协美术工作者所创造，它和旧洋片（西洋镜）完全不同。无论在形式上内容上都无相同之点，它完全是一种崭新的艺术形式的创造。所谓新洋片，实际上就是大幅连环画，加上诗歌（唱词）和音乐。并以一个类似小舞台的架子来演出。绘画、诗歌、音乐相结合，彼此更会发挥它的作用。唱词抽象的地方，画面给以具体的形象，画面不足的地方，唱词可以叙述出来。这样可说声色俱备。因此新洋片在某种意义上讲，也是一种综合性的艺术。老百姓称它为：“小戏”。并说：“新洋片露脑子露的快。”（易懂的意思）。“比戏听得清，每幅画都有新景。”
    延安文协的新洋片，当时曾在延属分区各县巡回演出。洋片的内容主要是反映生产运动，宣传破除迷信等。因为群众真正欢迎它，所以很短时间内，它在群众中生了根。记得子长县民教馆及别的宣传部门，都仿照了文协的新洋片，赶庙会，赶集市，普遍的利用它作宣传，教育群众。
    日本投降以后，延安一部份美术工作者，以数月的时间集体创作了一套“赵天顺翻身”的洋片，以二十四幅油画画出。并请管弦乐团三位同志配合演出。徐老（徐特立）及一些负责首长看后，给新洋片许多赞扬和鼓励，一致认为“洋片有前途。美术天地扩大了。”当时为了配合陇东分区的土改，洋片便去那里演出了一个多月，群众对它印象极深。洋片中的故事、人物、群众非常熟悉。唱词和歌曲，在小学生中很流行。几个县的民教馆、学校都自动仿照新洋片，以同样的内容各制一套。新洋片在陇东分区很快地就生了根。同年文工室转移绥德分区工作，新洋片在群众中也受到同样的爱戴和欢迎。
    民卅五年晋冀鲁豫边区开群英会，那里的美术工作者也曾以新洋片活动过。他们以四个多月时间集体创作了一套“土地还家”。共五十五幅。是描写佃户王栋儿全家受地主王三泰的欺压、剥削为主题，内容穿插较前复杂。作者们都是群众运动的参加者。有丰富的生活。集体讨论角本、构图、色彩。人物的个性、身份、外象，都是从群众中去选真的模特儿。画法极其写实。这样长的连环画，需演唱三个钟头，在洋片活动上，还是第一次。
    “土地还家”在武安县八九区演出了一个多月。群众反映说“这比看新戏一样！演唱的都是咱自己的事。”有的说：“看洋片可以开脑筋，懂事多；又好看又省钱。”又有的说：“洋片能听的清。人都画活了；人都要从纸上走下来，和真事一样样……。”因此每到一处群众情绪都很高，都是自始至终一口气看完，甚至看第二遍，第三遍。干部们对新洋片也同样的喜爱。冶陶土地会议时一千多个干部都要求看洋片。
    去年秋，洋片随人民美术工场一部分同志进了石市。为了配合城市宣传工作，我们又把洋片搞起来。画了“将革命进行到底”、“参军模范家庭”、“新兵生活”等短小的片子。在市郊区演出后，回到市内，在花园街试演了两次，结果效果非常好，工人、学生、市民特别欢迎。接着又连演了好多次，“将革命进行到底”等片子在花园竟演了一个月零三天。票价三百元，每天两场，场场满座。工人也欢喜看洋片，石家庄的各工厂都去请新洋片演出过。有的大厂甚至演出几次。看了“将革命进行到底”、“土地还家”等片子，工人说：“这比上政治课一样有意思。”有的说：“看了将革命进行到底，就等于读了一本近代革命史”。“蒋介石比毒蛇还毒。”有的说：“以后洋片也应画画咱工人。”……我们的洋片在石市演出不久，电灯公司的工人、教养院、第一中学、一区政府、临清市民教馆，都搞起洋片来。有的搞的比较好，有的较为简陋。有的自己画起新片子，有的仿照我们原有的片子照抄一套。因此新洋片在城市也很快生了根。阵地一天一天大起来了。
