　　Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 10th: Warsaw dispatch: The Polish parliament held a meeting on the 8th. The most important agenda item was the first reading of the Trade Union Law. It is unprecedented for the draft formulated by the Trade Union Congress to be submitted to the parliament as a bill. The Trade Union Law affirms that the rights of workers and staff to freely form trade unions and actively participate in exercising people's power should be guaranteed, and all regulations left over from capitalism that hinder trade union activities shall be abolished. Zawadzki, chairman of the Central Council of Polish Trade Unions, stated in his speech to the parliament that if the parliament passes this law, it will mean using the law to guarantee the best conditions for the development of trade unions and to consolidate the victory of the working class and the people's power. The parliament also accepted President Beirut's proposal and decided to elect Zawadzki to participate in the Council of State.

　　波兰议会讨论职工法案
    【新华社北平十日电】华沙讯：波兰议会八日举行会议。最主要议程为初读职工会法案。职工会代表大会所制订的草案之作为法案提交议会，尚属创举。职工会法案认定：应保证工人及职员自由组成职工会和最积极地参加执掌人民政权的权利，凡资本主义遗留下来的阻碍职工会活动的一切规章，均予取消。波兰职工会中央理事会主席查瓦得兹基在议会上发言称：如果议会通过这一法案，它就意味着用法律来保证发展职工会的最优良条件，来巩固工人阶级的胜利和人民政权。议会并接受贝鲁特总统的提议，决定选派查瓦得兹基参加国务会议。
