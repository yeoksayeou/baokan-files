	【Report from this newspaper】In recent days, food prices in the Beiping market have generally fallen. Yesterday morning (June 6th), the opening prices in the grain market were 3,800 yuan per bag of regular flour (wholesale price, same below), 52 yuan per jin of "Fudi" millet, 39 yuan per jin of corn, and 98 yuan per jin of rice. Compared with the peak food prices in May (May 19th and 20th), regular flour dropped 1,300 yuan per bag, "Fudi" millet dropped 10 yuan per jin, and rice dropped 22 yuan per jin.
	Recently, of the flour sold in the Tianjin market, two-thirds came from Bengbu, Xuzhou, and other places. As new wheat is about to enter the market, grain merchants are feeling weak and have begun to sell, eagerly converting to cash to buy wheat south of the river. With abundant grain sources and a substantial spot market, grain prices are falling daily. (Zhong)

	【Another report】Yesterday, yarn prices rose while cloth prices remained stable. At the No. 2 Factory's Wufu morning market, the opening price was firm, closing flat. In the afternoon, it followed Tianjin's rise. Later, due to rain, there was no market. In the yarn market, because newly established factories are acquiring raw materials, there were many sellers. The closing price was 200-300 yuan higher per bundle than the previous day (June 5th). Sesame oil prices decreased along with sesame prices, leading to many transactions, and later the price slightly rose. White oil prices fell, with plentiful supply and few transactions. Kerosene and gasoline prices fell along with Tianjin's prices, and sales were sluggish. Prices of other goods mostly remained stable, but there were no large transactions. Cotton textiles in the general merchandise category rose slightly. Merchants from Taiyuan came to Beiping to purchase "Four-in-One" soap, and transactions were somewhat brisk. The prices of sugar and pigments in Shanghai are very low, and the local spot market is increasingly abundant, causing merchants to feel weak.

　　粮源畅旺价续落　纱升布平油类跌
    【本报讯】近数日来，平市粮价普遍下跌。昨（六日）晨粮食市场开盘通粉每袋三千八百元（批发价，下同）、伏地小米每斤五十二元、玉米三十九元、大米九十八元。与五月份粮价高峰（五月十九日、二十日）相较，通粉每袋落一千三百元，伏地小米每斤落十元，大米每斤落二十二元。
    新近天津市场出售之面粉，新从蚌埠、徐州等地运来者即占三分之二。新麦亦即将登场，存粮商人心气虚软，开始抛售，并急欲换成资金南下购麦。粮食来源畅旺，市场现货充实，粮价遂逐日下降。（仲）
    【又讯】昨日纱升布平，二厂五福早市开盘即坚，收盘平，下午随天津上升，后因雨无市。纱市因有新成立之工厂上市收购原料，故售货者显多，收盘较前（五日）每捆上升二、三百元。香油随芝麻价格下降，成交多，后价稍涨。白油下跌，上货多，成交少。煤油、汽油随天津下落，销路不畅。其他各货多持平，但无大量成交。百货类棉织品略升。四合一香皂有太原商贩来平收购，成交略畅。上海糖类及颜料等价格甚低，本市现货益丰，故商人心气颇软。
