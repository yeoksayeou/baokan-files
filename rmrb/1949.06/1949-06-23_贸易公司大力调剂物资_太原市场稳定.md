    Trade Company Vigorously调剂 Materials
    Taiyuan Market Stabilizes
    [Taiyuan Dispatch] Commodity prices in Taiyuan City stabilized in early June and have remained relatively stable since, with market transactions becoming increasingly active. Financial and trade authorities have taken the following important measures to stabilize prices: (1) The Taiyuan City Trade Company distributes materials to various state-owned factories. In May, it distributed 1.75 million jin of millet, 180,000 jin of white flour, and 330,300 jin of miscellaneous grains, ensuring the livelihoods of workers. This played a decisive role in the resumption of production and the stabilization of prices. (2) The Military Control Commission issued a proclamation prohibiting the use of silver dollars (白洋) and speculation in gold and silver. It has also cracked down on numerous cases of speculation and imposed penalties based on the severity of the offense, leading to a gradual decrease in speculators. The local currency has taken the lead in the market, establishing its credibility. (3) The City Trade Company, possessing abundant materials, has proactively regulated prices. In April, the company transferred 1.5 million jin of grain into the city. In May, it transferred nearly 6 million jin of coarse and fine grains. In June, it had already transferred 2.87 million jin of grain and successively transferred 6 million square feet of homespun cloth. Based on the situation in neighboring areas, the price of millet was appropriately lowered from 40 yuan per jin to 36 yuan per jin. By controlling the reasonable price difference that could attract grain from the surrounding countryside, a steady flow of grain was ensured. In terms of cotton cloth, local products and cotton cloth from the east were able to flow into neighboring areas (northern and western Shanxi), invigorating the market. According to incomplete statistics, on June 7th, farmers from Daixian in northern Shanxi transported 7,000 jin of millet, 2,000 jin of mung beans, and 3,000 jin of naked oats into the city. On June 13th, Wutai transported 1,000 jin of rice, and Guoxian transported 8,000 jin of millet. From June 5th to 10th, Qixian, Pingyao, Xiaoyi, and Linfen in southern and central Shanxi transported 37,000 jin of miscellaneous grains, 50,000 jin of white flour, and 2,000 jin of millet. On June 16th, Pingyao alone transported 11,000 jin of wheat and 290 bags of white flour. From May 10th to mid-June, the Trade Company sold a total of 1.9 million square feet of homespun cloth, 5,123 bolts of white foreign cloth, and 1,899 bolts of colored foreign cloth to northern, western and southern Shanxi. Due to the availability of materials, the market is extremely stable and becoming increasingly active.
