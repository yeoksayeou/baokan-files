　　British Imperialist Economic Plunder of Burma
    By Leonidov
    Translated by Wang Zhihuan
    In the past thirty years, this country with vast, almost untouched natural resources has simply been a gold mine for colonial capital. Although British investment in Burma was far less than in India, or even in neighboring Malaya, the profits were extraordinarily large.

    It has become commonplace for large capital companies in Burma to earn back their original investment in a few years, or even a few months. For example, take the Steel Brothers company, which paid out dividends totaling 235 percent of its original capital in six years, plus issued capital stock of 212 percent, for a total profit of 447 percent. The English-Burmese Tin Mining Company paid dividends at a rate of 130 percent five years after starting operations. In the period from 1931 to 1935 alone, the Burma Oil Company earned its shareholders a profit of 113 percent in the form of dividends and capital stock; and the 1947 surplus was three times this amount. The Mawchi Mines Limited, which mined tungsten and tin deposits in southern Burma, paid dividends totaling 472.5 percent of its original capital in the five years from 1936 to 1940, in other words, shareholders received an amount equivalent to their original investment each year.

    Profits like these broke even colonial plunder records. Burma was a gold mine for British companies, a hunting ground where the rest of the world was fenced out. Without any special expenses or technical efforts, they extracted huge sums of money from this country. Therefore, the exploitation of Burma became a privilege for a small circle of Britain’s leading monopoly capitalists. Only the most powerful London "City" (the center of British monopoly capitalist financial activity, equivalent to Wall Street in the United States) tycoons and their political entourage could share a piece of the pie.

    Basically, the whole of Burma is still the private domain of five companies to this day. They divided among themselves the majority of Burma's natural resources, transportation, trade and finance. These companies hold almost all of the British capital assets in Burma, totaling 50 million pounds. They control every factory, large and small, in every industry. Burma's capitalist economy is almost entirely the property of these five companies. They are the real masters of the country's 17 million oppressed and ravaged people.

    The London-based Steel Brothers company, with branches throughout Asia, controls the rice trade, which is the main source of revenue for Burma. Rice is the staple food of the vast majority of farming people. Burma is the world's largest exporter of rice, and its rice paddies produce one-third more than those in India. In terms of value, rice accounts for almost half of Burma's total exports. The poor people of India rely mainly on Burmese rice for their food.

    Due to the brutal commercial exploitation of Burmese farmers and Indian laborers, Steel Brothers has become one of the most profitable companies in Britain. It also had a hand in the crazy rice speculation of 1943, which resulted in a severe famine in Bengal, in which millions of people starved to death. This company also owns cotton mills, flour mills, timber concession areas and rubber plantations in Burma. Its managing director, Sir Wright, chairman of the Burmese Department of Commerce, has considerable political influence in the Burmese Upper House and is the driving force behind the current government.

    The Bombay Burma Trading Corporation, affiliated with the London merchant Wallace Brothers, controls the Burmese timber industry, which produces the world's most valuable teak. Two-thirds of this valuable export product is produced by the Bombay Burma Trading Corporation and Steel Brothers. Large areas of Burma are under the actual rule of this company's agents.

    The Irrawaddy River is Burma's main artery, dividing the country from north to south for about a thousand miles of navigable waters. Almost all of Burma's rice and teak are transported by water. Even this river has become virtually the property of a British company, the Irrawaddy Flotilla Company. Before the war, it had six hundred ships, carrying seven million passengers a year. The Irrawaddy Flotilla Company was directly involved in the conquest of Burma in the last century, its ships transporting British troops sent to conquer the local inhabitants. The company also controls sea and air routes. Since 1865, the Irrawaddy Flotilla Company has been systematically strangling the Burmese economy for the benefit of the colonizers by using its transportation monopoly.

    Burma has very rich deposits of tin, silver, lead, zinc, tungsten, copper and other metals. These mineral resources are almost entirely owned by the fourth British company, Burma Corporation Limited. The 11,000 workers employed in the Bawdwin mine in northern Burma are semi-slaves. On the other hand, Burma Corporation Limited's metal monopoly in Burma, combined with the privileges of British companies in neighboring Malaya, ensures Britain's leadership in certain international strategic materials cartels.

    Burma's oil resources belong to one of the most powerful British colonial companies, the Burma Oil Company. It seized this industry sixty years ago. Since then, Burmese oil production has increased 130-fold, and shareholders' profits have risen in the same proportion. Burma Oil Company is the largest company in the country, employing 45,000 staff, clerks, and commercial agents in Burma and India. In India, Burma Oil Company is linked to the Tata family of monopoly capital, the loyal servants of the British colonial regime and now the pillars of the Nehru government. No political, economic, or military measures taken by the British authorities in Burma are not approved in advance by the Burma Oil Company, and its close agents are scattered in every department of the colonial administration.

    These five large British companies, not counting their smaller allies, dominate Burma; for almost a century, they have drained the marrow of that country's defenseless people. But behind these five companies are the elite of the British ruling class, for whom their word is law to every British government.

    Wallace Brothers, which controls the Bombay Burma Trading Corporation, is closely linked to the Guest family, British heavy industry magnates who bear the Conservative Party's financial expenses. Churchill's predecessor Chamberlain was a member of this line. This company also has a significant influence on the British imperialist apparatus in India. Lord Chelmsford, who was the Governor-General of India from 1916 to 1921, was one of its close confidants.

    The Burma Oil Company is part of the British oil monopoly headed by Asiatic Petroleum Company. Together, these two companies control Anglo-Iranian Oil Company, Iraq Petroleum Company, and many other companies. Those who own Burmese oil are also the same British tycoons who hold the Middle East in their palms and direct British policy around the world. Sir Deterding's successor, Sir Fraser, director of the Burma Oil Company and chairman of the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company, is the petroleum advisor to the British War Department.

    The Irrawaddy Flotilla Company is directly linked to the Guest family and the leading British shipbuilding companies. Its director, Sir McCrae, was formerly a Liberal Member of Parliament and chairman of the British Shipping Federation. His father was the Minister of Shipping. Steel Brothers represents powerful British and Indian financial forces, and its influence has not diminished in any way because India has gained empty independence. The chairman of the company, James Michie, is also the head of the State Bank of India.

    Behind Burma Corporation Limited, which monopolizes Burma's mineral resources, is a syndicate of prominent British businessmen and politicians that operates and mines precious metals in hundreds of mineral concession areas in Africa, Asia, Australia, and Latin America. One of the companies associated with Burma Corporation Limited is Federal Limited, whose chairman is Bracken, formerly Churchill's secretary, who has the closest relationship with Churchill among British politicians and served as Minister of Information in his wartime cabinet. Other mining magnates who served in Churchill's government include Lord Leathers, Lord Harlech, and Lyttelton.

    For this group of Britain's leading tycoons, Burma is a constant source of wealth. Losing this territory would be a serious blow to the London "City".

    When the Japanese invaders were driven out of Burma, Britain found itself facing a powerful mass movement in the country, demanding complete liberation from the colonial yoke, and under its banner the entire people were united. So British monopoly capitalists decided on a grand charade. They ordered the Labour government to grant "freedom" to Burma—but this was only to re-conquer the Burmese people then and there with the help of the "democratic socialist" neo-colonial method.

　　英帝国主义对缅甸的经济掠夺
    李昂尼多夫  著

    在过去三十年中，这个有着广大、差不多未染指过的天然富源的国家，简直是殖民资本的一座金山。虽然英国在缅甸的投资远不及在印度，甚至在邻邦马来亚那么多，但是利润却异常的庞大。
    缅甸的大资本公司，于几年，甚至几个月之内赚回他们的投资原本，已经成为司空见惯的事了。譬如拿斯蒂尔兄弟公司来说吧，六年中就付出总值为原本百分之二百三十五的红利，另外还发行了百分之二百十二的资金股票，总共是百分之四百四十七的利润。英缅锡矿公司于营业开始五年之后，红利付息率是百分之一百三十。仅在一九三一到一九三五年期间，缅甸石油公司以红利及资金股票的形式，就给它的股份持有者赚了百分之一百十三的利润；而一九四七年的盈余是三倍于此。在南缅开采钨与锡矿藏的莫契矿产有限公司，从一九三六到一九四○年的五年中，付出红利总值达原本的百分之四百七十二点五，换言之，股份持有者每年所得相当于其原来的投资。
    象这样的利润打破了甚至殖民地掠劫的记录。缅甸是英国公司的金矿，一个世界别国都被圈在栏外的储猎场。不用什么特别费用或技术工夫，他们从这个国家榨取了巨大的财额。因此，对缅甸的剥削成为英国头号独占资本家小圈子的特权。只有最有权势的伦敦“城”（Ｃｉｔｙ，英国独占资本家金融活动中心，相当于美国的华尔街）大亨们和他们的政治随从们，才能分享一杯羹。
    基本上，整个缅甸直到今天还是五家公司的私有园地。他们彼此之间瓜分了缅甸的天然富源的大部，运输工具，贸易与金融。这些公司占有差不多全部的英国在缅甸的资本资财，总值五千万镑。他们控制着每一门工业的每一个大小工厂。缅甸的资本主义经济差不多全是这五个公司的财产。他们是那个国家一千七百万受压迫蹂躏的人民的真正主子。
    在亚洲各地都有分行的伦敦斯蒂尔兄弟公司，控制着为缅甸税收主要来源的大米贸易。大米是绝大多数务农人民的常川食粮。缅甸是全世界输出大米最多的国家，它的稻田比印度的产量还要高出三分之一。论价值，大米差不多顶缅甸出口总数的一半。印度的穷人，就是主要依靠缅米为粮食。
    由于对缅甸农民及印度劳动者残酷的商业剥削，斯蒂尔兄弟公司已成为英国赢利最大的公司之一。它在一九四三年疯狂的大米投机中也插了一手，那次事情的结果是孟加拉省的严重粮荒，几百万人的饿死。这个公司在缅甸还拥有棉纱厂，面粉厂，木材特权区和橡胶园。它的经理董事特依特爵士，缅甸商业部的主席，在缅甸上议院有非同小可的政治影响，是现在政府的幕后动力。
    附属于伦敦商家华莱斯兄弟公司的孟买、缅甸贸易公司，掌握着出产世界上最多麻栗木的缅甸木材业。这种贵重产品出口货的三分之二是由孟缅贸易公司及斯蒂尔兄弟公司探制的。缅甸整个大片区域是在这个公司代理人的实际统治之下。
    伊拉瓦底河是缅甸的大动脉，它把国土从北到南划分为二，大约有一千哩的地方可以通航。缅甸的大米和麻栗木差不多全部都从水上运输。甚至这条河也变成一家英国公司——伊拉瓦底轮船公司——的实际上的财产了。在战前它有六百只轮船，每年载运七百万旅客。伊拉瓦底轮船公司在上一世纪曾经直接参与征服缅甸，它的船只输送了派来征服本地居民的英军。公司还控制着海上与空中的航线。从一八六五年以来，伊拉瓦底轮船公司一直在用它的运输垄断权，有系统的，为着殖民者的利益，绞杀着缅甸的经济。
    缅甸拥有非常丰富的锡、银、铅、锌、钨、铜和其他金属的矿藏。这些矿产资源差不多全部都被第四个英国公司——缅甸有限公司所占有。位于缅甸北部的波德温矿区所雇用的一万一千工人是半奴隶。而另一方面，缅甸有限公司在缅甸的金属独占，与在邻邦马来亚英国公司的特权，合起来就保证了英国在某些国际战略物资卡特尔中的领导地位。
    缅甸的石油资源是属于最有势力的英国殖民地公司之一——缅甸石油公司的。六十年以前它就攫取了这门工业。从那时起，缅甸的石油产量增加了一百三十倍，而股份持有者的利润也以同样的比例升高了。缅甸石油公司是境内最大的公司，它在缅甸与印度雇用了四万五千工作人员，办公人员，和商业代理人。在印度，缅甸石油公司是和独占资本的塔塔家族联系在一起的，后者是英国殖民地政权的忠实仆人，现在是尼赫鲁政府的支柱。缅甸的英国当局所采取的任何政治、经济、或军事措施，没有一件不是预先得到缅甸石油公司的批准的，而它的亲信代理人则散布在殖民地行政机构的每一部门。
    这五个英国大公司，还不算他们较小的同盟者，主宰着缅甸；差不多有一世纪以来，把那个国家无防御的人民的膏血吸取殆尽。但站在这五家公司后面的是英国统治阶级的精萃，对于每一届英国政府他们的话就是法律。
    控制孟缅贸易公司的华莱斯兄弟公司，与承担保守党财政开支的英国重工业巨子哥埃斯特家族有密切的连系。邱吉尔的前任张伯伦，就是这一系的一员。这一公司对于印度的英帝国主义机构也有着重大影响。一九一六至一九二一年任印度总督的千姆斯佛勋爵就是它的一员亲信。
    缅甸石油公司是以亚细亚汽油公司为首的英国汽油独占资本的一部分。这两个公司共同控制着英伊（伊朗）石油公司，伊拉克石油公司，还有其他许多公司。占有缅甸石油的，也就是握中东于掌中、在世界各地指挥英国政策的同一英国大亨们。迪特丁爵士的继承人之一，缅甸石油公司董事兼英伊石油公司主席的佛锐瑟爵士，就是英国作战部的汽油顾问。
    伊拉瓦底轮船公司是与哥埃斯特家族及首要英国造船公司有直接联系的。它的董事麦克雷爵士，从前是一个自由党议员，英联王国航业部主席。他父亲是航运部长。斯蒂尔兄弟公司代表着强大的英、印金融势力，而其影响绝没有因为印度得到了空洞的独立而减小。公司的主席——詹姆斯·密奇，也就是印度国家银行的首脑。
    站在独占缅境矿物资源的缅甸有限公司后面的，是著名英国商人及政客的辛迪卡，它经营开采着在非、亚、澳、及拉丁美洲的几百矿产特权区的贵重金属。与缅甸有限公司有关的公司之一就是联邦有限公司，其主席就是以前邱吉尔的秘书布蕊肯，在英国政客中与邱吉尔的关系最密，战时在其内阁中任情报部长。其他在邱吉尔政府中任职的矿产大亨，还有莱则士爵士，哈莱奇爵士，和李特欧登。
    对于这群英国头号财阀，缅甸是致富的常流之源。失去这块领域对于伦敦“城”将是一个严重的打击。
    当日本侵略者从缅甸被驱逐出去的时候，英国发现自己正碰上这个国内的一个强大的群众运动，它要求从殖民地枷锁中得到完全解放，而在它的标帜下全体人民都团结了起来。于是英国独占资本家们决定要一套大花枪。他们论令工党政府将“自由”准给缅甸——而这不过是想借助于“民主社会主义”的新殖民方法，来就时就地重新征服缅甸人民。
