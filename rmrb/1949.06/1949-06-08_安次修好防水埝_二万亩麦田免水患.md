　　An'ci Repairs Waterproof Embankment, 20,000 Mu of Wheat Fields Spared from Flooding

　　[Hebei Central News] The Yongding River floods every year when the wheat is about to ripen, which the local people call "Wheat Yellow Water." The wheat fields along the riverbank in An'ci County were flooded year after year. Building a dike for flood prevention has become an urgent demand of the people. In view of this, the People's Government led the people to build a waterproof embankment before the flood season. After the heavy rain on May 21st, while people were still unable to go to the fields to rush to cultivate and plant, it mobilized the masses in the villages along the river to build the waterproof embankment in a concentrated effort. The project was carried out in three sections, with a total length of 5,650 zhang, a base width of 4 zhang, a height of 2 chi, and a top width of 2 chi. Under the highly concerted and dedicated efforts of 1,242 people in 20 villages including Dongzhangwu, Taipingzhuang, and Xudongzhuang, such a project was completed in two days, spanning 38 li (based on 150 zhang per li). 20,000 mu of wheat fields were saved from being flooded.

　　安次修好防水埝　二万亩麦田免水患
    【冀中讯】永定河每年在麦将黄时即涨水一次，当地人民称之为“麦黄水”安次县县境沿河岸的麦田连年被淹，筑堤防水，成了人民的迫切要求，人民政府有鉴于此，便在水汛前领导人民修筑防水埝，五月二十一日大雨后，乘人们还不能下地抢耕抢种的时候，发动了沿河村庄群众，突击修筑防水埝。工程分三段进行，共长五千六百五十丈，底宽四丈，高二尺，顶宽二尺。这样的工程在东张务、太平庄、许东庄等二十个村一千二百四十二名群众的高度努力突击下，二日即先后竣工，长达三十八里（以一五○丈为一里计）二万亩麦田可免被水淹。
