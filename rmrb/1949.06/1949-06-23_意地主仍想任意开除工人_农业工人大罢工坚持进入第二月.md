    Italian Landlords Still Want to Arbitrarily Fire Workers
    Agricultural Workers' Strike Enters Second Month
    [Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 22nd] Negotiations between Italian landlords and striking agricultural workers broke down again on June 18 because the landlords refused the demand that workers should not be arbitrarily dismissed. The strike of two million agricultural workers has entered its second month. According to TASS, the negotiations had, in principle, reached a partial agreement satisfying some of the demands put forward by the agricultural workers. For example, signing a single national collective contract, extending unemployment relief legislation to agricultural workers, and increasing social insurance for accidents or illnesses. During the negotiations, representatives of the Agricultural Workers' General Union and the Italian General Confederation of Labour demanded that landlords should not arbitrarily dismiss workers, but should base dismissals on the decisions of a special committee composed of representatives of both labor and management. The landlords refused to concede on this point, thus demonstrating their determination to retain their unfettered control over the countryside and to be able to constantly threaten "recalcitrant" farmers with dismissal. The negotiations therefore broke down. Landlords and government authorities continue to violently suppress the strikers. Recently, new conflicts have occurred in the Po Valley and Apulia regions, in which several agricultural workers were injured. Many strikers have been arrested. In many agricultural areas of Emilia, the police have promulgated regulations similar to the German occupation regulations, all gatherings are prohibited, bars and cinemas are closed, and a curfew is in effect from 9 p.m.

    意地主仍想任意开除工人
    农业工人大罢工坚持进入第二月
    【新华社北平二十二日电】意大利地主与罢工的农业工人间的谈判，由于地主们拒绝不得任意开除工人的要求，已于六月十八日再度破裂。二百万农业工人的罢工已进入第二个月。据塔斯社报道，此次谈判在原则上已获得满足农业工人所提出的若干要求的部分协议。例如签订单一的全国性的集体合同，把失业救济立法扩大适用于农业工人，增加对意外或疾病的社会保险等。在谈判过程中，农业工人总工会与意大利总工会的代表们，要求地主不得任意开除工人，而应该根据劳资双方代表组成的特别委员会底决定。地主们拒绝在这一点上让步，因而表明了他们力图保留他们对农村的不受拘束的支配，并且可以经常以开除威胁“顽抗”的农民，谈判因此陷于破裂。地主和政府当局继续以暴力镇压罢工者，波河流域与阿蒲里亚区近来发生了多起新的冲突。在冲突中，农业工人若干受伤。罢工者被捕甚多。在艾米利亚的许多农业地区，警察颁布了与德国占领法规一样的条例，一切集会都遭禁止，酒吧间及电影院关门，下午九时起即实行宵禁。
