Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 2nd: TASS, Berlin: The Third German People's Congress concluded on May 30th. The Congress issued a declaration to the German people calling for German unification, the early conclusion of a peace treaty with Germany, and the withdrawal of occupying forces, stating in part: The Third German People's Congress, at a time when the Foreign Ministers' Conference is being held and the future of Germany has reached a critical juncture, is deeply concerned about the aftermath of the fatherland and the lives of our people. We demand German unification and the early conclusion of a peace treaty. The only hope for the German people is that the four powers will reach an agreement on the German question at this conference. The declaration then traced back to last November when the Presidium of the German People's Council made a proposal urging the governments of France, Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union not to delay the convening of a Foreign Ministers' Conference to discuss a peace treaty with Germany and prepare for the peace conference. At the same time, the Presidium also made the following suggestions to the participating countries of the Foreign Ministers' Conference and the people of the world: (1) Formulate the principles of the peace treaty based on the Yalta and Potsdam decisions; (2) Restore the administrative and economic unity of Germany; (3) Restore a unified currency for the whole of Germany and abolish inter-zonal economic and transportation restrictions; (4) Organize a temporary German democratic central government composed of representatives of democratic parties and organizations. The composition of this government must guarantee a long-term policy of peace; (5) Convene a peace conference with the participation of the temporary German democratic government. At the same time, the Presidium also put forward various principles related to the peace treaty.

　　The declaration pointed out: The London Conference decision of the Western countries created the division of Germany. Western countries have taken the following measures, such as issuing separate currencies, suspending inter-zonal traffic, dividing the Saar region, passing the Ruhr Statute, turning the Ruhr region into an arms factory, restoring militarism in the Western occupation zones, concluding the North Atlantic Treaty, and finally forming a separate West German state. The "Bonn Constitution" cleared the way for a divided West Germany to join the North Atlantic military treaty. West Germany is being transformed into a military base for gold-backed imperialism. This division of Germany has caused a national disaster. The German People's Council once called for national self-salvation and launched a people's movement to support the call for a peaceful and unified Germany. The declaration called on the people of the whole country to strengthen the national united front for the unification and peace of Germany! Fight together for a unified, independent, and peaceful Germany, and fight for the most rapid conclusion of a peace treaty and the withdrawal of occupying forces.

　　德国人代会发表宣言
    【新华社北平二日电】塔斯社柏林讯：第三届德国人民代表大会已于五月三十日闭幕。大会向德国人民发表要求德国统一与及早缔结对德和约及撤退占领军的宣言略称：第三届德国人民代表大会在外长会议开会、德国前途到达紧要关头的时候，深深地关怀祖国的善后和我国人民的生活。我们要求德国统一和及早缔结和约。德国人民唯一的希望就是四国在本届会议上获得对德问题的协议。宣言继即追述远在去年十一月，德国人民委员会主席团即已提出建议，促请法英美苏四国政府勿再拖延召开外长会议，讨论对德和约与准备和会。同时，主席团并向外长会议参与国和全世界人民提出如下建议：（一）以雅尔塔和波茨坦决定为基础，制订和约的原则；（二）恢复德国行政与经济统一；（三）恢复全德的统一货币，取消区际的经济和运输限制；（四）组织临时德国民主中央政府，由民主党派与团体代表组成之。这个政府的组成分子必须保证爱好和平的长期政策；（五）召开有临时德国民主政府参加的和会。同时，主席团并提出有关和约的各项原则。
    宣言指出：西方国家的伦敦会议决定，造成了德国的分裂。西方国家采取了下面这些措施，如发行单独的货币，停止区际交通，分裂萨尔区，通过鲁尔法规，变鲁尔区为军火厂，恢复西方占领区的军国主义，订立北大西洋公约，最后组成分立的西德国家。“波恩宪法”为分裂的西德参加北大西洋军事公约扫清了道路。西德正被改造为金元帝国主义的军事基地。这样分裂德国引起了全国的灾难状态。德国人民委员会曾经号召民族自救，并发起了人民运动来支持争取和平与统一的德国的号召。宣言号召全国人民加强争取德国统一与和平的全国阵线！共同为统一、独立与和平的德国而斗争，为最迅速地缔结和约与撤退占领军而斗争。
