　　Summer Study Group Leader Answers Reporters
　　Beijing-Tianjin Summer Graduates Participate in Study Group Voluntarily
　　[Report from this newspaper] In view of the fact that the committee of the Summer Study Group for graduating students from universities in Beijing and Tianjin has already started its work, this reporter paid a special visit to comrades Feng Naichao and Gong Zirong, the persons in charge of the group, to ask them to answer the following questions. Is it absolutely necessary for all graduates to participate in the study group? After the study is completed, will the work assignment be based on the wishes of each student? What courses will be studied and how will they be studied? The answers received are as follows: This group was established based on the following needs: On the one hand, we need to help graduating students find the path they should take politically, and on the other hand, we need to help them understand the various policies of the new social construction before they step from the school gate into society, so as not to be at a loss. At the same time, we also need to help them solve the difficulties of finding employment. Therefore, participation in the study is based on voluntariness, and finding a job is also based on voluntariness. After the study is completed, those who do not wish the government to assign them work are also free to do so. The courses of study mainly aim to enable students to understand the current domestic and international situation, the path that young people should take, and some policies related to construction. The method of study, in addition to inviting responsible comrades from the Party and government to give lectures, focuses on the students' own self-study and discussions. The organization of the study is planned to be divided into four teams, twenty-four classes, and one hundred and twenty groups, with approximately twenty people in each group. Group research and team discussions will be conducted. We respect freedom of thought and democratic discussion, so that students can develop democratic habits. We hope that the students who participate in the study will be able to spend a pleasant and fulfilling month of study with full spirit, and improve their political understanding before entering their work posts.

    【本报讯】记者以本届平津各大学毕业生暑期学习团团委会已经开始工作，特走访该团负责人冯乃超、龚子荣同志，请其解答下列几个问题。毕业生是否一律必需参加学习团，学习完毕后，工作分配是否按照各同学的志愿，学些什么课程，怎样学习？承答复如下：本团根据下述的需要成立的：我们一方面需要帮助毕业同学找出在政治上应走的道路，另方面又需要帮助他们在就业前事先了解新社会建设的各项政策，免得从校门踏入社会，茫然不知所之，同时也要帮助他们解决就业的困难。因此，参加学习根据自愿，找工作也根据志愿。学习完毕后，如有不愿政府分配工作的，也听其自由。学习课程，主要是让同学们了解今天国内外大势，青年应走的道路和一些有关建设的政策。学习方式，除邀请党政负责同志讲演外，着重同学们自己的自修和讨论。学习的组织，拟分四个队，二十四个班，一百二十个组，每组人数约二十人。分组研究，分队讨论。我们尊重思想自由，民主讨论，让同学们养成民主习惯。希望参加学习的同学，都能够精神饱满地过一个月愉快的充实的学习生活，进入工作岗位之前，在政治认识上有所提高。
