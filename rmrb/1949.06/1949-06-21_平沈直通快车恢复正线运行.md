    (Beiping News) The Shenshan Railway line for the through express train between Beiping and Shenyang has resumed regular line operation since June 15th, shortening travel time and further facilitating transportation between inside and outside Shanhaiguan. Since the through express train between Beiping and Shenyang began operating on May 1st of this year, it has been convenient for merchants and passengers. However, at that time, the 166-kilometer section of track and bridges on the Shenyu Railway line from Shuangyangdian to Xinmin was under urgent repair, so it was necessary to detour through Jin-Gu-Xin-Yi-Gao-Xin lines, traveling an extra 58 kilometers in total, taking an additional two hours and thirty minutes, and costing an extra 80 yuan in People's Currency per third-class ticket. Now, thanks to the Northeast Railway Administration's efforts to rush repairs, the entire section from Shuangyangdian to Xinmin has been restored, and regular line operation has resumed from the 15th of this month.

    平沈直通快车恢复正线运行
    【平市讯】平沈直通快车沈山线自六月十五日起恢复正线运行，缩短行车时间，关内外交通更形便利。平沈直通快车自本年五月一日起开行以来，客商称便，惟当时沈榆线自双羊店至新民一段，计长一六六公里路轨桥梁，正在赶修，故须绕行锦古新义高新等线，全程多走五十八公里，多耗二小时三十分钟时间，每张三等客票多费人民券八十元。现经东北铁路总局努力抢修结果，双羊店至新民一段全部修复，并自本月十五日起，恢复正线行车。
