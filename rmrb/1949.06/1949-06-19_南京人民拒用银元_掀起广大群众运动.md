Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, June 18th: A mass movement to eliminate silver dollar speculation and refuse the use of silver dollars has swept Nanjing. On May 17th, the Nanjing Military Control Commission issued an order prohibiting the circulation of silver dollars. At the time, the People's Government, in consideration of the temporary difficulties faced by silver dollar peddlers in changing their livelihoods, temporarily established a silver dollar exchange to allow registered peddlers to trade; at the same time, it banned the black market and strictly prohibited agency merchants from buying and selling silver dollars and manipulating speculation. However, a small number of illegal merchants disregarded government decrees and continued to speculate, which affected price fluctuations earlier this month and greatly harmed the lives of citizens. The people of the city deeply resented silver dollar speculators. Workers, students, and legitimate merchants all sent letters to the local Xinhua Daily, requesting that they be strictly banned. On the 12th, the Nanjing Municipal People's Government announced the "Provisional Measures for the Management of Gold and Silver in the East China Region," and the Municipal Bureau of Industry and Commerce also issued a notice "Ceasing Silver Dollar Trading Activities in This City," announcing the immediate cessation of silver dollar exchange activities. The Nanjing Branch of the People's Bank was to set up a silver dollar redemption office to redeem silver dollars at posted prices. In addition, economic work teams were sent to crack down on illegal merchants' silver dollar black markets. These government measures were immediately met with enthusiastic response from the city. Workers, students, and citizens all rose up to assist the government in implementing them. The worker picket team at the Nanjing Railway Station of the Beijing-Shanghai Railway, on the 13th alone, found more than 2,300 silver dollars and 40 taels of gold at the station. Workers on the "Qingdao" and "Bohai" ships at the Pukou Port Authority automatically conducted propaganda among passengers to refuse the use of silver dollars. Employees of the Jiangsu Postal Administration and its branches launched a signature campaign to guarantee their refusal to use silver dollars. Employees of the Municipal Post Office specially printed many propaganda slogans to ban silver dollars and posted them on mail for delivery. The Nanjing Municipal Shop Employees' Union held its inaugural meeting on the 13th, where 3,000 representatives swore to refuse the use of silver dollars, issued a declaration of refusal, and held a parade. The Nanjing Student Union called on students throughout the city to carry out propaganda and report on speculative merchants. From the 11th, student propaganda teams from various schools launched extensive propaganda activities. Central University alone formed 18 propaganda teams, with all members participating. The Preparatory Committee of the Nanjing Chamber of Commerce took "Refusing to Use Silver Dollars and Fighting Illegal Merchants" as its current central task. Representatives of 80 trade associations and six major department stores, as well as many companies and banking circles, held forums, expressing their firm support for the decrees of the People's Government. Many shop windows and streets were plastered with slogans and cartoons refusing the use of silver dollars. Currently, citizens are enthusiastically exchanging silver dollars at banks, with more than 15,000 silver dollars redeemed on the 13th and 14th alone. On the 14th, more than 400 silver dollar peddlers had begun to change their occupations. Some merchants who continued to conduct illegal silver dollar transactions have been investigated and are being dealt with by the People's Government according to law.

　　Also Reported: In order to regulate people's food and stabilize prices, the Nanjing Municipal People's Government has sold more than 14,000 jin of food rice to 13 units, including railway and dock workers, at prices 5% lower than the market price, and has decided to continue to supply employees, students and citizens with food rice at low prices.
