	A Brief Discussion of the Recent Ideological Struggle in Soviet Literary and Art Circles
    Yu Wenzai
    In the past three years, the Soviet Union has carried out fierce struggles on the ideological front in literature and art, as it has in philosophy, economics, and biology. The struggle in literature and art has lasted even longer.

    From August 1946 to the end of January this year, the Central Committee of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks), Central Committee Secretary Zhdanov, the Soviet Writers' Union, the Soviet Composers' Union, the Party Central Committee's newspaper "Pravda," and the Central Propaganda Department's newspaper "Culture and Life" have continuously made many important criticisms and instructions regarding literature, drama, film, and music.

    The targets of a series of struggles are creators, critics, and leaders (the latter including editorial departments, group organizations, and local Party committees, etc.) in the field of literature and art who are self-deprecating, pro-Western, rigidly adhering to the past, abandoning the past for the "present," indifferent to politics, and value personal relationships.

    So-called self-deprecation refers to the neglect, distortion, and slander of Soviet reality and outstanding Soviet works. Examples of the former include Zoshchenko's works, the film "The Great Life," and the play "Conscience." Examples of the latter include the remarks of the anti-patriotic theater critic group.

    So-called pro-Westernism refers to the worship of the decadent culture of the European and American bourgeoisie, such as aestheticism, formalism, and the translation and performance of bourgeois writers' works that have no ideological or artistic value.

    So-called rigidly adhering to the past refers to the obsession of some writers and directors with historical themes in their creations, which have neither historical nor educational significance. Such as several historical dramas in the repertoire of various theaters before 1946.

    So-called abandoning the past for the "present" refers to the neglect of Russian classical dramas, the denial of the basic principles of Russian and Western European classical music, and the emphasis on formalism and modern music. Such as the operas "The Great Friendship" and "The Story of a Real Man."

    So-called indifference to politics and valuing personal relationships means forgetting the "Party spirit of literature," prioritizing friendships and personal interests over the interests of the country and the people, and lacking and hindering principled Bolshevik criticism. Those who hold this attitude are mostly the above-mentioned critics and leaders. Such as some members of the editorial boards of the "Zvezda" and "Leningrad" magazines and the anti-patriotic theater critic group.

    This struggle, which lasted nearly three years, had two climaxes. In the first climax, the main target of the struggle was the creators of literature and art. In the second climax, the main target of the struggle was the critics—the anti-patriotic theater critic group.

    The following is a brief introduction to the struggle currently underway.

    At the plenary sessions of the council held by the Soviet Composers' Union and the Soviet Writers' Union at the end of last year, a detailed review was made of the literary and artistic phenomena after the first climax (the resolutions on film and drama have been seen in the "Northeast Daily" and this publication). The Writers' Union believes that the most unsatisfactory thing is a group of aesthetic and formalist theater critics. By the end of January this year, "Pravda" and "Culture and Life" each published editorials as long as eight or nine thousand words: the former was "On an Anti-Patriotic Group of Theater Critics," and the latter was "On the Enemy's Camp (Subtitle: 'On the Conspiracy of the Anti-Patriotic Group of Theater Critics')". Since then, Soviet newspapers and magazines, literary and artistic groups, and the masses of readers have focused on the discussion of this issue. The scope of the review has expanded from drama to film, literature, art, and some departments of social science. The region of this movement has spread from Moscow to various republics.

    The core of this group of critics is a group of people who use double-dealing tactics to occupy key positions and boast each other to become false authorities, such as: Yuzovsky (who was the actual leader of the publishing department of the All-Russian Theater Association), Malyugin (a member of the editorial board of "Soviet Art Newspaper" and staff member of the Writers' Union), Altman (former editor-in-chief of "Theater Monthly"), Borshchagovsky (former director of the literary department of the Red Army Theater, former member of the editorial board of "New World" magazine), Boyadshiev (former director of the literary department of the Red Army Theater, former chairman of the Critics' Union of the All-Russian Theater Association), Warshavsky (former director of the literary column of "Soviet Art Newspaper"), Kholodov (former director of the art column of "Literary Newspaper"), and Gurvich (details unknown).

    Their positions were in the Critics' Union of the All-Russian Theater Association and the Drama Committee of the Soviet Writers' Union, as well as "Theater Monthly," "Soviet Art Newspaper," and "Literary Newspaper." Their targets of attack are Soviet modern playwrights, new young playwrights, outstanding Soviet plays (many of which have won Stalin Prizes, as well as Gorky's plays), and famous Soviet theaters such as the Moscow Art Theater and the Maly Theater. They have two tactics: slander (specifically against excellent plays) and silence (specifically against bad scripts, occasionally also against good scripts).

    As for their theory, it is the theory of aestheticism and formalism. Here are a few facts to illustrate it:

    1. For example, Yuzovsky said that Nil in Gorky's "The Petty Bourgeois" is "an immature character," and he said that the writer's appearance here as a political commentator is not suitable for the structure of art. The structure of art and the logic of the theme are precisely the masks of bourgeois aesthetes. If Nil, this affirmative character, is deleted, this famous work, which initially depicts the image of the revolutionary proletariat in the history of world literature, will become a castrated work.

    2. Another example is a very popular drama "theory" in the Soviet Union after the war, called "the conflictlessness of Soviet drama." The creator of this "theory" is this group of anti-patriotic critics. And some well-intentioned liberals have unintentionally echoed it. They said that the war is over, the external enemy (referring to German fascists) has disappeared, and conflict does not exist in Soviet plays. This is such an ignorant and harmful formalist theory.

    Aestheticism and formalism are linked to cosmopolitanism, just as realism is inseparable from patriotism. It is also a natural result for aesthetic and formalist critics to become anti-patriotic cosmopolitans. In recent months, when Soviet publications mention the names of these people, they are often prefixed with titles such as "anti-patriotic elements—cosmopolitans," which is why.

    Cosmopolitans believe that the whole world is their motherland and oppose any nationality. Under the pretext of creating "world" and "universal" culture, they cancel the national traditions and national cultures of various nations. Cosmopolitanism is the negation of the historically formed characteristics of the nation in its own development, the negation of national interests, national independence, and the state sovereignty of various nations. Cosmopolitanism has been an ideological weapon in the hands of the exploiting classes since its birth, used to defend and cover up their aggressive policies. It has developed to the extreme in the age of imperialism. After the Second World War, cosmopolitanism has become a smokescreen used by American imperialists to cover up their imperialist aggression and plunder, enslave other nations, suppress revolutionary movements, incite wars, and establish the world rule of American imperialism.

    The above-mentioned "vagrants without passports in humanity" (Belinsky's words) have indeed become prisoners of the American imperialists. But in front of the advanced Soviet people, they cannot play any role.

　　略谈苏联文艺界最近的思想斗争
    郁文哉
    在最近三年间，苏联在文学艺术方面，如象在哲学、经济学、生物学方面一样，曾进行了思想战线上的剧烈斗争。而在文学艺术方面的斗争，持续得更久。
    自一九四六年八月起，直至本年一月底止，联共（布）中央、中央故书记日丹诺夫、苏联作家协会、苏联作曲家协会、党中央机关报“真理报”、中央宣传部报纸“文化与生活”对于文学、戏剧、电影、音乐等，曾连续不断地作了许多重要的批评和指示。
    一批斗争的对象是妄自非薄、甘拜洋风、食“古”不化、弃古从“今”、漠视政治、重视私交的文学艺术方面的创作者、批评家和领导者（后者包括编辑部、团体机关、地方党委等）。
    所谓妄自非薄，就是对苏联现实和对苏联优秀作品的漠视、歪曲和诋毁，属于前者的如左琴科的作品、影片“伟大的生活”、剧本“良心”，属于后者的如反爱国主义剧评家集团的言论。
    所谓甘拜洋风，就是崇拜欧美资产阶级的堕落文化，如唯美主义、形式主义以及翻译和上演毫无思想艺术价值的资产阶级作家的作品。
    所谓食“古”不化，就是象一部份作家和导演着迷于以历史为主题的创作，而其创作既无历史意义，亦无教育意义。如一九四六年前各剧院上演目录中的若干历史剧。
    所谓弃古从“今”，就是象漠视俄国古典剧作，否定俄国和西欧古典音乐的基本原则而重视形式主义和现代派的音乐。如歌剧“伟大的友谊”和“一个真有的人的故事”。
    所谓漠视政治和重视私交，就是忘记了“文学的党性”，视朋友关系和私人利益高于国家和人民的利益，缺乏并妨碍原则性的布尔什维克批评。抱持这种态度的，大都是上述的那种批评家和领导者。如“星”与“列宁格勒”两杂志的若干编委和反爱国主义剧评家集团。
    这一持续了几达三年之久的斗争，其间有两个高潮。在第一个高潮中，斗争的主要对象是文学艺术方面的创作者。在第二个高潮中，斗争的主要对象是批评家——反爱国主义剧评家集团。
    兹就目前正在展开的斗争略加介绍如后。
    在去年年底，苏联作曲家协会和苏联作家协会各自举行的理事会全会上，曾就第一高潮以后的文学艺术现象作了一次详细的检讨（其中关于电影戏剧方面的决议已见“东北日报”及本刊）。作家协会认为最不能令人满意的，就是一批唯美主义和形式主义的剧评家。至本年一月底，“真理报”和“文化与生活”各自发表了一篇长达八九千字的社论：前者为“论一个反爱国主义的剧评家集团”，后者为“在异己６的战阵上（副题为‘论反爱国主义剧评家集团的阴谋’）”。自此以后，苏联的报纸杂志、文艺团体和读者群众都集中注意于这一个问题的讨论。检讨的部门已自戏剧展延至电影、文学、美术，以及社会科学中的若干部门。这一运动的地域已自莫斯科波及到各共和国。
    这一剧评家集团的核心，都是以两面派手法而窃居要津，相互吹嘘而成为假权威的人，如：尤左夫斯基（曾是全俄戏剧协会出版部的实际领导人）、马留金（“苏联艺术报”的编委和作家协会的工作人员）、阿尔特曼（曾任“戏剧月刊”的主编）、包尔沙高夫斯基（曾主持红军剧院的文学部、曾任“新世界”月刊的编委）、包雅德什耶夫（曾主持红军剧院的文学部、曾是全俄戏剧协会剧评家联合会的主席）、华尔沙夫斯基（曾主持“苏联艺术报”的文学栏）、霍洛道夫（曾主持“文学报”的艺术栏）和顾尔维奇（不详）。
    他们的阵地是在全俄戏剧协会中的剧评家联合会和苏联作家协会中的戏剧委员会，以及“戏剧月刊”、“苏联艺术报”和“文学报”。他们的攻击目标是苏联现代剧的作家、新进的青年剧作家、苏联的优秀剧本（其中有不少剧本是得了斯大林奖金的，还有高尔基的剧本）和苏联的著名剧院如艺术剧院和小剧院。他们的战术有两种：诋毁（专对优秀剧作）、沈默（专对坏剧本，间或亦对好剧本）。
    至于他们的理论，就是唯美主义和形式主义的理论。现举一二事实来说明它：
    一、例如尤左夫斯基说高尔基的“小市民”中的尼尔是“一个未成熟的人物”，他说作家以政论家的姿态在这里出现是与艺术的结构不适合的。艺术的结构，主题的逻辑，这正是资产阶级唯美主义者的假面具。假如把尼尔这一肯定的人物删去，世界文学史中最初描写革命无产阶级形象的这部名著便成了阉割的作品。
    二、又如战后苏联有一个很流行的戏剧“理论”，叫做“苏联剧作的无冲突性”。这个“理论”的首创者，就是这一批反爱国的批评家。而某些好心肠的自由主义者则有心无心地从而附和之。他们说战争结束了，剧本中的外敌（指德国法西斯）消失了，冲突（Ｃｏｎｆｌｉｃｔ）在苏联剧本中不存在了。这是一个多么无知而有害的形式主义理论。
    唯美主义、形式主义之与世界主义相互联系，一如现实主义之与爱国主义不可分割。唯美主义的和形式主义的批评家之成为反爱国主义的世界主义者，也是必然的结果。近几月来的苏联刊物上提到这批人的姓名时，往往冠以“反爱国主义者—世界主义者”这样的名衔，其故即在此。
    世界主义者认为整个世界就是自己的祖国，反对任何国籍。借口创造“世界的”、“全人类的”文化，取消各民族的民族传统和民族文化。世界主义，这就是否定民族在自己的发展中由历史而形成的特性，否定民族利益、民族独立和各民族的国家主权。世界主义自其诞生之日起，至今一直是剥削阶级手中的思想武器，用以辩护和掩护他们的侵略政策。到了帝国主义时代，它已发展到了极度。在第二次世界大战以后，世界主义已成为美帝国主义者用以掩护其帝国主义侵略和掠夺，奴役其它民族，镇压革命运动，煽动战争，建立美帝国主义的世界统治而用的烟幕。
    上述的那些“人类中没有护照的浪人”（倍林斯基语），实已当了美帝国主义者的俘虏。但在先进的苏联人民面前，他们是起不了丝毫作用的。
