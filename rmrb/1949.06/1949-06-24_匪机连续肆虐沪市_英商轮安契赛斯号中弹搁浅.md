Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 23rd: On the 20th and 21st, Kuomintang bandit planes continuously flew over Shanghai to wreak havoc, and attacked British and American merchant ships. At 9:45 AM on the 21st, two Canadian-made Mosquito bandit planes chased the British Taikoo Steam Navigation Company's "Anchises" merchant ship, which had just sailed from Wusongkou to the Gaoqiao section of the Huangpu River. A bomb hit the port side between the engine room and the fourth deep tank. The ship immediately ran aground, with the stern sinking. Four British sailors were injured. The ship's deadweight tonnage is 8,200 tons. At the same time, the No. 6 warehouse of the British Asiatic Petroleum Company near by was bombed. The American ship "General Gordon" outside Wusongkou was also strafed by bandit planes.

At about 3 PM on the 20th, two Canadian-made Mosquito bandit planes bombed and strafed Shanghai residents, dropping a bomb between Laiyu Wharf and Dongjiadu Wharf, destroying three civilian boats, killing and injuring nine boatmen including Zhang Shunji. In addition, two citizens were injured by bombing on Huangpo Road and Pushan Road. When the bandit planes flew over the city, the air defense order in the city was good. The People's Liberation Army's air defense forces fired with anti-aircraft firepower, forcing them not to fly low.
