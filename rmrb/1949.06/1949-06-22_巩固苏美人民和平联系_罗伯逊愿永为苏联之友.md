    Consolidating Peaceful Ties Between Soviet and American Peoples
    Robeson Vows to Forever Be a Friend of the Soviet Union
    Xinhua News Agency, Beiping, 21st: New York dispatch: American black singer Paul Robeson returned here on the 16th from Europe. In an interview with a TASS reporter, he declared that he would do his utmost to consolidate the peaceful ties between the Soviet people and the American people, that he would forever be a loyal friend of the Soviet Union, and that he would use lectures and performances to help millions of people in the United States and elsewhere understand the leading role of the Soviet Union today in the movement to establish peace and eradicate fascism throughout the world. Robeson pointed out that he saw no signs of the European people yearning for the Atlantic Pact and the Marshall Plan. American capitalists superficially control the Marshallized countries, but are actually hated by the people of these countries. Robeson denounced the despicable act of forty American police officers and detectives patrolling his plane at the airport.

    巩固苏美人民和平联系
    罗伯逊愿永为苏联之友
    【新华社北平二十一日电】纽约讯：美国黑人歌王罗伯逊于十六日自欧洲飞返此间。他在接见塔斯社记者时宣称：他将竭力巩固苏联人民与美国人民之间的和平联系，他将永为苏联的忠实朋友，他将利用讲演和演奏，努力帮助美国及其他各地的千百万人民，了解今天苏联在全世界建立和平与根除法西斯的运动中的领导作用。罗伯逊指出：他看不到欧洲人民响往大西洋公约和马歇尔计划的迹象，美国大资本家表面上控制着马歇尔化的国家，而实为这些国家的人民所痛恨。罗伯逊斥责美国四十个警察和侦探在飞机场上巡逻他的飞机的卑鄙行为。
