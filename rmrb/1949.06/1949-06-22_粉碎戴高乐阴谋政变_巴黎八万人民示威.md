Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, June 21st: On the 18th, 80,000 people in Paris held a counter-demonstration against the anti-republican demonstration by de Gaulle elements. According to TASS, many signs indicate that June 18th was the date originally planned by the de Gaulle faction to launch a coup against the Republic, which was recently discovered. All democrats and republicans in Paris, under the call of their organizations, expressed their firm determination to smash de Gaulle's conspiracy, and held a large anti-de Gaulle demonstration with more than 80,000 participants on the same day and in the same area as de Gaulle's demonstration. The demonstration launched by de Gaulle was attended by less than 30,000 people.

On the rostrum addressing the anti-demonstrating Republicans stood French Communist Party leaders Duclos, Dillon, and Bonté; representatives of the French Women's Union, Leclerc and Vimeux; representatives of the French General Confederation of Labor, Momouse, Lenoir, and Tauré; representatives of the Unified Socialist Party, Fauré and Goblat; and representatives of the left-wing Socialist Party who participated in the resistance movement. All speakers attacked de Gaulle's anti-republican assault. Rear Admiral Mauric, in his speech, emphasized that it is the responsibility of all republicans to oppose de Gaulle's provocations. We have gathered here to protest the conspirators' attempts. Let us ensure further strengthening the unity of the French people who hope for France's freedom and happiness. Thanks to the unity of the entire French people in the anti-German war, we won. Tomorrow, the close alliance of all republicans will enable us to win peace.
