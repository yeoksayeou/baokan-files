  　The Greek Problem Can and Must Be Solved
    For nine years, Greece has been a scene of continuous war. The defeat of the German fascist invaders seemed to serve as a solid foundation for the national development and rejuvenation of the Greek people, as well as for ensuring the consolidation of the sovereignty and independence of the Greek state. However, reality has failed to meet these expectations.
    If the freedom-loving Greek people could handle everything themselves, if the US and British ruling groups did not base their policies towards Greece on their selfish interests, if they did not provide the most reactionary elements in Greece with economic and military assistance, then the Greek problem would have ceased to exist long ago. The consequences of this policy of supporting the royalist fascist reactionaries are obvious. Even the reactionary British Daily Mail admits: "In social terms, Greece is more than a century behind the rest of Europe."
    Greece has been torn apart by the civil war provoked by the royalist fascist ruling group and their protectors. The reactionary group is carrying out a terrible policy of terror and suppression against the Greek people.
    The Greek economy is undergoing increasing disintegration. The budget deficit has risen to an absurd number. An anarchic inflation of currency has reigned unrestrained in the Greek economy. Millions of men, women, and children have formed a huge army of hungry people without homes or any means of making a living. As Tsirmis, the former Minister of National Economy of the Athens government, stated: "Greece is in danger of an inevitable economic disaster."
    At the end of April this year, at the New York meeting of the United Nations General Assembly, representatives of the United States and Britain met with representatives of the Soviet government and put forward a proposal requesting discussion of the issue of stopping the Greek civil war and the necessary measures to resolve the general problems of Greece. The Soviet government agreed to participate in the work of stopping the Greek civil war and establishing peace in Greece. Moreover, in response to the US and British request that the Soviet Union state its position on practical measures to put the Greek situation on the right track, the Soviet government put forward a specific plan. This plan includes the following points: The three countries must call on the warring parties in Greece to cease fire. A general amnesty must be declared in Greece, and universal and free parliamentary elections must be held. The necessary condition to guarantee such elections must of course be that the highest Greek body handling the elections includes representatives of the Greek democratic forces leading the Greek People's Liberation Movement. The Soviet proposal also emphasized that representatives of various countries, including the Soviet Union, should supervise the elections in Greece. At the same time, a joint committee of various countries, including the Soviet Union, should be established, and its task is to control the border between Greece and its neighboring countries. When implementing this control, it must be announced that foreign countries will stop providing the Greek government with military assistance in manpower and materials. At the same time, it is also suggested to stipulate the date for the withdrawal of foreign troops from Greece.

  　希腊问题能够而且必须解决
    九年来希腊一直是继续不断的战争场所。德国法西斯侵略者的失败，似乎可作为希腊人民的民族发展与复兴、以及确保希腊国家主权与独立的巩固基础了。然而现实却未能符合这些预期。
    假如爱好自由的希腊人民能够自行处理一切，假如美英统治集团不以他们自私的利益作为它们对希腊政策的基础，假如他们不给予希腊最反动的分子以经济和军事援助，那么希腊问题老早就会不存在了。这种支持保皇法西斯反动派的政策，其结果是显然的。甚至英国反动的每日邮报也承认：“就社会意义来说，希腊落后于欧洲其他部分一世纪以上。”
    希腊被保皇法西斯统治集团与他们的保护者所挑起的内战弄得四分五裂。反动集团进行着可怕的恐怖与镇压希腊人民大众的政策。
    希腊的经济正经历着日益增大的瓦解。预算赤字已上升到荒唐的数目。通货的无政府的膨胀在希腊经济中已无拘束地凌驾一切。成百万男女和儿童形成了无家无业和没有任何谋生方法的饥饿大军。正如雅典政府前国民经济部长齐尔米斯所声称的：“希腊存在着不可免的经济大难的危险。”
    本年四月终，在联合国大会的纽约会议上，美英两国的代表与苏联政府的代表会晤，提出建议，要求讨论停止希腊内战的问题及解决希腊一般问题所必要的措施。苏联政府同意参加停止希腊内战和建立希腊和平的工作。并且，苏联政府在回答美英请求苏联表明其对使希腊情势走入正轨的实际措施所持立场中，提出了具体的方案。这一方案包括下列几点：三国必须呼吁希腊交战双方停战。必须在希腊宣布普遍大赦，必须举行普遍、自由的议会选举。保证这种选举的必要的当然条件必须是，办理选举的希腊最高机构包括领导希腊人民解放运动的希腊民主力量的代表。苏联的建议也强调包括苏联在内的各国代表应对希腊的选举实行监督。在同时应建立包括苏联在内的各国联合委员会，它的任务是管制希腊与其邻国接壤的边境。在实施这种管制时，必须同时宣布停止外国方面给予希腊政府人力物力上的军事援助。同时，并建议规定外国军队自希腊撤退的日期。
