Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, June 19th: Speeches by Chairman Mao Zedong, Commander-in-Chief Zhu De, Mr. Li Jishen, Mr. Shen Junru, Mr. Guo Moruo, Mr. Chen Shutong, and Mr. Chen Jiageng at the opening ceremony of the Preparatory Meeting for the New Political Consultative Conference:

(I) Chairman Mao's Speech:
Fellow representatives:

The preparatory meeting for our New Political Consultative Conference opens today. The task of this preparatory meeting is to complete all necessary preparations, to promptly convene the New Political Consultative Conference, and to establish a democratic coalition government, so as to lead the people of the whole country to eliminate the remaining forces of the Kuomintang reactionaries at the fastest speed, to unify the whole of China, and to systematically and step-by-step carry out political, economic, cultural, and national defense construction work throughout the country. The people of the whole country hope that we will do this, and we should do it.

The New Political Consultative Conference was proposed to the people of the whole country by the Chinese Communist Party on May 1, 1948. This proposal was quickly responded to by all democratic parties, people's organizations, democratic figures from all walks of life, ethnic minorities within the country, and overseas Chinese. The Chinese Communist Party, all democratic parties, people's organizations, democratic figures from all walks of life, ethnic minorities within the country, and overseas Chinese all believe that it is necessary to overthrow imperialism, feudalism, bureaucratic capitalism, and the rule of the Kuomintang reactionaries; it is necessary to convene a political consultative conference including representatives of all democratic parties, people's organizations, democratic figures from all walks of life, ethnic minorities within the country, and overseas Chinese, to declare the establishment of the People's Republic of China, and to elect a democratic coalition government representing this republic. Only in this way can our great motherland break away from its semi-colonial and semi-feudal fate and embark on the road of independence, freedom, peace, unity, and prosperity. This is a common political basis. This is the common political basis for the united struggle of the Chinese Communist Party, all democratic parties, people's organizations, democratic figures from all walks of life, ethnic minorities within the country, and overseas Chinese. It is also the common political basis for the united struggle of the people of the whole country. This political basis is so solid that not a single serious democratic party, people's organization, or democratic figure has raised any different opinions. Everyone believes that this is the only correct direction for solving all of China's problems.

The people of the whole country support their People's Liberation Army and have achieved victory in the war. This great People's Liberation War began in July 1946 and has now lasted for three full years. This war was launched by the Kuomintang reactionaries with the assistance of foreign imperialism. The Kuomintang reactionaries broke their promises and tore up the truce agreement and the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference of January 1946, launching this anti-people civil war. However, in just three years, they have been defeated by the heroic People's Liberation Army. Not long ago, after the peace conspiracy of the Kuomintang reactionaries was exposed, the People's Liberation Army bravely advanced and crossed the Yangtze River. The capital of the Kuomintang reactionaries, Nanjing, has been captured. Shanghai, Hangzhou, Nanchang, Wuhan, and Xi'an have been liberated. Now, the various field armies of the People's Liberation Army are carrying out a large-scale advance towards the southern and northwestern provinces, an advance unprecedented in Chinese history. In the past three years, the People's Liberation Army has eliminated a total of 5,590,000 reactionary Kuomintang troops. As of now, the remaining Kuomintang troops, including their regular troops, irregular troops, and rear military organs and military schools, number only about 1,500,000. It will take some time to eliminate this part of the remaining enemy troops, but it will not be long.

This is a victory for the people of the whole of China, and it is also a victory for the people of the world. The entire world, except for the imperialists and reactionaries of all countries, is jubilant about this great victory of the Chinese people. The struggle of the Chinese people against their enemies is the same as the struggle of the people of the world against their enemies. The people of the whole of China and the people of the whole world have seen the fact that the imperialists directed the Chinese reactionaries to cruelly oppose the Chinese people with counter-revolutionary war, and the Chinese people successfully overthrew the reactionaries with revolutionary war.

Here, I think it is necessary to draw people's attention to the fact that the imperialists and their running dogs, the Chinese reactionaries, will not be reconciled to their failure on this land of China. They will still collude with each other and use all possible means to oppose the Chinese people. For example, sending their running dogs into China to carry out divisive work and sabotage work. This is inevitable, and they will never forget this work. For example, instigating the Chinese reactionaries, even adding their own strength, to blockade China's seaports. They will do this as long as they still have the possibility. Furthermore, if they still want to take risks, it is not impossible to send a part of their forces to invade China's borders. We must fully estimate all of these. We must never relax our vigilance against the mad revenge plot of the imperialist elements and their running dogs because of victory. Whoever relaxes this vigilance will disarm himself politically and put himself in a passive position. In this situation, the people of the whole country must unite and resolutely, thoroughly, cleanly, and completely smash any conspiracy or plan of the imperialists and their running dogs, the Chinese reactionaries, to oppose the Chinese people. China must be independent, China must be liberated, and China's affairs must be decided by the Chinese people themselves, and no imperialist country is allowed to interfere in the slightest.

The Chinese revolution is a revolution of the entire nation and the broad masses of the people. Except for the imperialists, feudalists, bureaucratic bourgeoisie, Kuomintang reactionaries, and their accomplices, all other people are our friends. We have a broad and solid revolutionary united front. This united front is so broad that it includes the working class, the peasant class, the petty bourgeoisie, and the national bourgeoisie. This united front is so solid that it possesses a strong will and inexhaustible ability to defeat any enemy and overcome any difficulty. The era we are in now is an era in which the imperialist system is heading towards total collapse. The imperialists have fallen into an inextricable crisis. No matter how much they want to continue to oppose the Chinese people, the Chinese people always have a way to achieve final victory.

At the same time, we declare to the world that what we oppose is only the imperialist system and its conspiracy to oppose the Chinese people. Any foreign government, as long as it is willing to sever relations with the Chinese reactionaries, no longer colludes with or aids the Chinese reactionaries, and adopts a genuine rather than a false friendly attitude towards the people's China, we are willing to negotiate with it on the establishment of diplomatic relations on the basis of the principles of equality, mutual benefit, and mutual respect for territorial sovereignty. The Chinese people are willing to carry out friendly cooperation with the people of all countries in the world, to restore and develop international trade, so as to benefit the development of production and the prosperity of the economy.

Fellow representatives: All the conditions for us to convene the New Political Consultative Conference and establish a democratic coalition government are ripe. The people of the whole of China are so eagerly hoping that we will convene a meeting and establish a government. I believe that the work we are starting now will be able to satisfy this hope, and it will not take long to satisfy this hope.

Once the Chinese Democratic Coalition Government is established, its work focus will be: (1) Eliminating the remnants of the reactionaries and suppressing the sabotage of the reactionaries; (2) Doing everything possible to engage in the restoration and development of the people's economic undertakings with great strength, while simultaneously restoring and developing the people's cultural and educational undertakings.

The Chinese people will see that once China's destiny is in the hands of the people themselves, China will, like the sun rising in the east, illuminate the earth with its brilliant flames, quickly wash away the mud and stagnant water left by the reactionary government, heal the wounds of war, and build a brand-new, strong, and truly People's Republic of China.

Long live the People's Republic of China!
Long live the democratic coalition government!
Long live the great unity of the people of the whole country!

(II) Commander-in-Chief Zhu De's Speech:

Today, the preparatory meeting for the New Political Consultative Conference opens. Through the work of this preparatory meeting, a truly democratic and united New Political Consultative Conference will be produced, and through this conference, a national unified people's democratic regime of joint dictatorship by all revolutionary classes will be established. From then on, Chinese history will enter a new era. The people of the whole country feel extremely excited and happy!

The preparatory meeting for the New Political Consultative Conference opens today because all the conditions for convening the Political Consultative Conference are now ripe. Among these conditions, the most important is the victory of the People's Liberation Army throughout the country and the demise of the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang. Since our army crossed the Yangtze River on April 21, it has liberated major cities such as Nanjing, Shanghai, Hangzhou, Wuhu, Nanchang, Jiujiang, Wuchang, and Hankou, and has liberated the entire provinces of Jiangsu and Anhui, most of Hubei and Zhejiang, and part of Jiangxi and Fujian. On other battlefields, our army has liberated places such as Taiyuan, Datong, Xinxiang, Anyang, Xi'an, and Qingdao. Although the remaining enemies are still colluding with imperialism in an attempt to continue to struggle, their final and complete elimination is only a matter of time.

One of the characteristics of the Chinese revolution is "armed revolution against armed counter-revolution." It is not that revolutionaries particularly like guns; it is because revolutionary forces cannot survive without taking up guns. This bloody lesson made the Chinese revolutionaries—first of all, the Chinese Communist Party—recognize the importance of taking up guns. For more than 20 years, it is precisely because the Chinese people have had their own People's Liberation Army that imperialism and reactionary rulers, although colluding together and trying every possible way to kill the revolutionary forces at all times, have finally failed to achieve their goal. Today, the people's revolutionary war has finally won a national victory, establishing a national people's democratic regime. This historical experience is worth remembering.

This armed force of the Chinese people has been tempered in a long and arduous struggle. It has undergone countless tests and has suffered many setbacks and failures. But it has never succumbed to the enemy. Under the leadership of the proletariat and its political party, and with the support of the people of the whole country, it has waged a tenacious battle against the enemy, seizing the enemy's equipment and equipping itself. Today, this people's armed force has grown unprecedentedly strong, becoming an invincible force.

This people's armed force is so strong and so brave in battle because it belongs to the people and is completely integrated with the people. It has a high degree of political awareness, and it fully understands who it is fighting for. It is waging war under the guidance of the complete set of political strategies and strategic and tactical thinking of Comrade Mao Zedong, the leader of the Chinese people.

The People's Liberation Army is the most loyal supporter of the Chinese democratic movement, and now it is the most loyal supporter of the New Political Consultative Conference and the democratic coalition government that will soon be established. Now that the New Political Consultative Conference is about to be convened and the national people's democratic regime is about to be established, the People's Liberation Army will be the firm and unwavering pillar of this people's government. On the day of the establishment of the preparatory meeting for the New Political Consultative Conference, I, on behalf of all the commanders and fighters of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, wish the preparatory meeting success, wish the New Political Consultative Conference a speedy convocation, wish the democratic coalition government a speedy establishment, and wish the independent, democratic, and unified new China that will soon appear in the world.

(III) Mr. Li Jishen's Speech:

The people of the whole of China have long hoped for the emergence of a democratic, independent, peaceful, and prosperous China. For it, countless martyrs have sacrificed their heads and blood; for it, countless people have sacrificed their lives and property. Today, all the reactionary forces that are obstructing our nation-building are about to be completely eliminated, and we can smoothly establish a new China that meets the wishes of the people. What a happy thing this is!

The preparatory meeting for the New Political Consultative Conference is the beginning of building a new China that meets the wishes of the people, and we are participating in it with a very happy and excited mood. This beginning is actually a great revolutionary fruit. We have obtained this revolutionary fruit due to the Chinese Communist Party's more than 20 years of struggle and correct leadership, due to the heroic and skillful fighting of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, due to the sacrifices and struggles of the Chinese people, and due to the joint efforts of patriotic people from all walks of life. Therefore, we want to pay our respects to Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu, to the Chinese people, and to patriotic people who are dedicated to the democratic revolution.

We must prepare a New Political Consultative Conference that can represent all revolutionary strata of the country so that it can call on the masses of all strata, old and young, male and female, to unite together, do their best, and fight to the end to eliminate all reactionary remnants and build a new democratic China.

Secondly, the common nation-building program and the plan to establish the People's Republic of China's government are major national plans related to the lives of the people of the whole country. We must formulate practical draft plans with deep consideration and foresight so that the new China that the people desire can be established quickly.

In short, the responsibility of the preparatory meeting is very great. The people of the whole country are looking forward to beautiful results. We must redouble our spirits and earnestly and seriously carry out our work under the leadership of Chairman Mao!

(IV) Mr. Shen Junru's Speech:

Today is the opening day of the preparatory meeting for the Political Consultative Conference of the Chinese people. This day will leave an indelible and great memorial in modern Chinese history. The establishment of the preparatory meeting for the New Political Consultative Conference shows that the Chinese people's revolution has basically destroyed the counter-revolutionary rule of the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, and the revolutionary people's liberation war has basically laid the foundation for the national victory.

Junru is a member who participated in the old Political Consultative Conference with the qualification of a member of the China Democratic League. From the day the old Political Consultative Conference resolutions were completely torn up by Chiang Kai-shek to the opening day of the preparatory meeting for the New Political Consultative Conference today, a full three years have passed. These three full years are a history written with the blood and tears of millions of people, a history of the Chinese revolution carrying out the final liquidation struggle against the counter-revolution, and at the same time, a history of 475 million people striving for complete liberation under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and the great people's leader Mr. Mao Zedong.

Three and a half years ago, the Chinese people, in view of the fact that the long-term eight-year war of resistance had made people's livelihood difficult and the economy devastated to the extreme, urgently longed for domestic peace and true democratic peace. For this purpose, the Chinese Communist Party, our China Democratic League, and various democratic parties, spared no effort to hold political consultations with the Kuomintang reactionary government with the greatest tolerance, regardless of Chiang Kai-shek's past anti-people crimes. This was originally a brave attempt by the Chinese people to strive for democratic peace through coordination with the reactionaries. However, the Kuomintang reactionary group, even such an agreement on democratic peace that was beneficial to the country and the people and beneficial to itself, after everyone solemnly signed it, they brazenly tore it up unilaterally and persecuted and massacred democratic and progressive people who struggled for the hope that this agreement could be realized. Our China Democratic League therefore sacrificed its most valuable leaders: Mr. Li Gongpu, Mr. Wen Yiduo, Mr. Tao Xingzhi, and Mr. Du Binzhou. In addition to killing democratic and progressive people, they further launched a full-scale civil war in violation of the will of the people of the whole country, trying to kill all people who opposed their reactionary rule. Therefore, the people had to embark on the road of armed revolution to thoroughly destroy the Kuomintang reactionary rule and to realize true democracy and lasting peace.

The preparatory meeting for the New Political Consultative Conference was convened on the basis of the victory of this great revolutionary war. It is the logical conclusion of this victory. The historical experience of three and a half years of blood proves that true democracy and peace cannot coexist with the Kuomintang reactionary rule representing imperialism, feudal forces, and bureaucratic bourgeoisie. Only when this reactionary rule is swept away and the people of the whole country realize their position as the masters of the country can the people's great consultation among all classes, parties, groups, and ethnic groups guarantee the realization of the true democracy and lasting peace needed by the country and the people. The new Political Consultative Conference that we are preparing today is precisely such a people's great consultation conference.

Although this New Political Consultative Conference, which is being prepared today, is not a people's congress produced through universal suffrage, because it will include as widely as possible representatives of the broad masses of the people from all classes, parties, people's organizations, and even various occupations and various beliefs, its actual prestige must be no less than that of a people's congress. However, in order to reflect the demands of the people of the whole country as accurately as possible, the colleagues of the preparatory meeting must carefully study and discuss each proposal, especially the proposals on the common program and the organization of the central joint government. We must formulate a draft administrative program that can reflect the demands of the people of the whole country and formulate a draft outline of a joint government organization that is completely in line with the political principles of the revolutionary New Democracy, so as to smoothly carry out the New Democratic national construction and quickly realize the independent, democratic, peaceful, unified, and prosperous People's Republic of China.

The task that history has put before the Chinese people is very great and arduous. It requires us to transform a semi-colony that has depended on imperialism for more than a hundred years into a country that is not only politically but also economically and culturally completely independent. It requires us to transform a fragmented and backward feudal and semi-feudal country into an advanced country that is democratic and unified. It also requires us to transform a poor and weak agricultural country into a prosperous and strong modern industrial country. These are all more arduous tasks than overthrowing the rule of Chiang Kai-shek. In order to complete these arduous and great historical tasks, we must take the convocation of the New Political Consultative Conference as a great beginning.

Junru and the representatives attending this meeting from the Democratic League and all the members of the League deeply believe that under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and the wise people's leader Chairman Mao, and with the unanimous efforts of all colleagues in the preparatory meeting, we will be able to successfully complete the mission entrusted to us by history.

(V) Mr. Guo Moruo's Speech:

Today the preparatory meeting for the New Political Consultative Conference opens. This should be a momentous event in Chinese history, and even in world history.

The situation is progressing unusually rapidly. Since the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China called for the convening of the New Political Consultative Conference on May 1 last year, in just thirteen months, all the steps have seemed to be realized step by step at supersonic speed, and on a more magnificent scale than previously expected.

Taking only the number of representatives participating in the New Political Consultative Conference as an example, the number of representatives for the preparatory meeting proposed last year was only around 20, while today the number of representatives participating in the preparatory meeting is 134. The preparatory meeting alone is more than four times larger than the old Political Consultative Conference reluctantly convened by the Kuomintang reactionaries four years ago. The upcoming New Political Consultative Conference is expected to have about 500 representatives participating, which will be more than sixteen times larger.

The old Political Consultative Conference was dominated by reactionaries, with reactionary elements accounting for an absolute majority; the new Political Consultative Conference is dominated by revolutionary democratic forces, and no reactionary elements will participate.

Therefore, I feel that the opening of today's preparatory meeting for the New Political Consultative Conference is just like the sun, struggling in the darkness, after a long night of painstaking effort, finally emitting brilliant light, emerging from the horizon with the pace of thunder.

I cannot but celebrate the emergence of this newborn sun with full enthusiasm. I cannot but celebrate the eternal rise of this newborn sun, never to descend.

This is the prelude to an epic of a grand new national form, the glorious beginning of the transformation of a deformed old democracy to a new democracy.

Under the feudal rule of more than 2,000 years and the imperialist aggression of 100 years, and the comprador capitalism of 30 years, China's national production has lagged behind, and the people have suffered threefold enslavement. For one hundred years, our ancestors have fought unyieldingly and bloodily to rescue the backwardness and eliminate enslavement. However, even revolutions in the old democratic forms have not been completed.

In today's perspective, there is no need to regret this.

The old democracy is led by the bourgeoisie. When it emerges from the feudal system and moves uphill, it does raise production and meet the democratic and free demands of a portion of the people. But once the bourgeois regime is consolidated, all production wealth and democratic freedom are monopolized by the bourgeoisie, and it has no choice but to move downhill in reaction, becoming the object of the people's revolution. This is the reality presented to us by all old democratic countries.

The failure of the revolution in the old democratic form to be completed in China, in today's perspective, is not a misfortune, but rather a fortunate event. Today, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, who serve the people wholeheartedly, and under the illumination of the New Democracy advocated by Chairman Mao, we will forever walk uphill and never descend.

We, led by the most revolutionary vanguard of the proletariat, will use the strength of the entire nation to increase production, use the strength of the entire nation to guarantee democratic freedom, so that the fruits of the revolution will never be monopolized by the privileged class, will never be invaded by imperialism, but will transition to the higher stages of socialism and communism.

This is precisely the practical essence of the superiority of New Democracy over Old Democracy. In order to quickly complete the overall victory of New Democratic construction and to quickly develop towards a higher historical stage, all democratic parties and revolutionary strata of China should forever accept the strong leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and, under the victorious banner of Chairman Mao, stride forward bravely.

If we look further and wider, the mission of the Chinese people today is even greater.

Today, we must not only strengthen unity and solve our own problems with our own strength, but also closely connect with the progressive forces of the world to jointly solve the problems of the world. We must also strengthen the world's peace front, eliminate the poisonous flames of imperialism, to strive for the democratic freedom of all mankind.

This is also a far-reaching instruction given to us by New Democracy.

This is a patriotic internationalism, which stands in complete opposition to the so-called "cosmopolitanism" clamored by the imperialists to cover up their conspiracy to dominate the entire world.

The "cosmopolitanism" of imperialism is a disguised fascist monolithic unity. In a nutshell, it is to make the world the world of imperialism.

Our patriotic internationalism respects the independence and autonomy of all nations, allowing each nation to seek its own progress and then work together to seek the common progress of the whole world.

This kind of patriotic internationalism is like a large symphony composed of countless instruments, countless timbres, and countless performers harmoniously coordinated. Of course, there is a common score here. The motif of this score is to ensure that the production and democratic freedom of all mankind will never be monopolized by a few privileged classes or hegemonic countries, but will forever move upward. This is a large score composed of three parts, from New Democracy to Socialism to Communism.

Having been tempered for a hundred years, the Chinese people are fully qualified today to assume the role of an outstanding performer in this great symphony.

We must forever unite around the Chinese Communist Party, which serves the people wholeheartedly, and under the wise leadership of Chairman Mao, strive to promote the patriotic spirit and patriotic internationalism of New Democracy, accelerate the completion of the liberation of our nation, and further promote the great liberation of all mankind.

Long live the success of New Democracy!
Long live the liberation of the Chinese people!
Long live the victory of world peace and democracy!

(VI) Mr. Chen Shutong's Speech:

Today, the opening of the preparatory meeting for the New Political Consultative Conference is a momentous event in Chinese history, and it is also a very glorious and important milestone in world history. Shutong feels extremely honored and extremely fortunate to be able to participate in this grand event.

The opening of this meeting is of great significance. It symbolizes the end of an old era. The feudal rule that has oppressed the Chinese people for thousands of years, the imperialism that has invaded the Chinese people for more than a hundred years, and the bureaucratic capitalism that has exploited the Chinese people for more than twenty years—all these reactionary forces have been overthrown and crushed by the armed struggle of the Chinese people today. At present, the heroic Chinese People's Liberation Army is continuing to sweep away the remaining armed forces of the counter-revolution with overwhelming power. After the end of this military operation, the long-awaited domestic unified democratic and lasting peace of the Chinese people can be realized. And we firmly believe that the arrival of this peace will not require much time.

This meeting also symbolizes the beginning of a new era. From today onwards, the Chinese people are striding into the most solemn and important period in history—that is, the period of establishing our own people's regime. Under the leadership of this regime, the Chinese people will strive to build a New Democratic China, gradually transforming our backward agricultural country into an advanced industrial and agricultural country, and finally leading our heroic and hardworking but suffering people into a realm of health, happiness, and well-being.

Today, we are able to convene such a meeting with extremely important historical significance in this historical capital of Beiping, which cannot but be attributed to the continuous creation of brilliant victories by the Chinese People's Liberation Army, cannot but be attributed to the correct leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, which serves the people wholeheartedly, and cannot but be attributed to the wise instructions of the great people's leader and revolutionary mentor, Mr. Mao Zedong. Here, we should pay our respects to the People's Liberation Army, to the Chinese Communist Party, and to Mr. Mao Zedong.

"Unite the workers, peasants, soldiers, students, merchants, all oppressed classes, all people's organizations, all democratic parties, all ethnic minorities, overseas Chinese, and other patriotic elements, form a national united front, unify the leadership of the revolutionary cause, overthrow the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous dictatorial regime, and establish a democratic coalition government under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party with the participation of appropriate representatives of all democratic parties and people's organizations, and declare the establishment of the People's Republic of China." This is the most basic political program that the Chinese Communist Party has repeatedly announced for many years. Today, the holding of our New Political Consultative Conference preparatory meeting is a preliminary measure to realize this program. I believe that all our colleagues attending the New Political Consultative Conference will be able to do their best and provide the best and most appropriate opinions and methods to consolidate and develop the revolutionary fruits won by the Chinese people with countless bloodshed.

Undoubtedly, the difficulties facing us are many, many. The remaining forces of the counter-revolution have not been completely eliminated, and the imperialists are still attempting to directly or indirectly, openly or secretly, sabotage our revolution. Therefore, our various democratic classes and democratic parties must redouble our vigilance, redouble our sincere unity, and especially must sincerely and wholeheartedly accept the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and the people's leader Mr. Mao Zedong, strengthen and consolidate our national united front, give a fatal blow to the national traitors and all reactionary elements, and completely eliminate the remaining forces of imperialism from China. The struggle of the united democratic forces is also the struggle to sweep away the reactionary forces, and it is the struggle to build a democratic and independent country. Without the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, and without the unity of the various democratic parties, it is absolutely impossible to achieve victory in this struggle.

The most important of the current preliminary work of nation-building is to develop production, restore the level of the national economy, and lay a preliminary foundation for future political and economic construction. We in the industrial and commercial sector have the most important and direct responsibility for the realization of this important and urgent task. Colleagues in the industrial and commercial sector will do our best to give full play to the patriotic spirit of creation and sacrifice, and intensify our efforts to express our warm support for the New Political Consultative Conference.

Let us hold high the banner of the people's democratic national united front, unite closely together under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and the people's leader Chairman Mao, jointly lay the foundation for democratic construction, and strive to build a New Democratic China! I would like to wish this meeting success here!

(VII) Mr. Chen Jiageng's Speech:

Today, the preparatory meeting for the New Political Consultative Conference is officially opened in order to invite various democratic parties, people's organizations, and people from all walks of life to jointly discuss the convening of the New Political Consultative Conference and the establishment of a people's united government. This is a major event in Chinese history. It is a major event related to the happiness of our future generations. Thanks to the correct leadership of Chairman Mao Zedong of the Chinese Communist Party and the heroic fighting of the People's Liberation Army, most of the land in China has been liberated. The Chiang Kai-shek reactionary group, which is corrupt and dictatorial and deeply hated by the people of the whole country, is now only left with a dying breath. Overseas Chinese are all celebrating with the same voice. I took this opportunity to return to the motherland for sightseeing and investigation. After arriving in Beiping, I was recommended by the leaders of the Chinese Communist Party, Chairman Mao, and various democratic parties and people's organizations as a representative to attend the preparatory meeting. I asked myself that my talent and knowledge were limited, and I declined many times, but I deeply felt that the responsibility was very heavy.

Overseas Chinese are very eager for the motherland to be peaceful, democratic, unified, and prosperous. However, due to Chiang Kai-shek's cunning dishonesty and the Kuomintang reactionary group's corruption and brutality, the people still cannot turn over. During the War of Resistance Against Japan, I returned to China to comfort the troops and personally went to Chongqing and Yan'an, and I saw it very clearly. The Chiang Kai-shek government in Chongqing only knew how to plunder the people's wealth and squander it at will; while Chairman Mao and other CCP leaders in Yan'an were diligent and hardworking, and always planned for the people. After the end of the War of Resistance, the old Political Consultative Conference was held. At that time, I estimated that asking Chiang Kai-shek to return power to the people was like seeking skin from a tiger, and it was impossible to succeed. At that time, Chairman Mao of the Chinese Communist Party did not avoid danger and personally went to Chongqing to discuss cooperation with Chiang Kai-shek. Chairman Mao must have understood that Chiang Kai-shek was cunning and insincere, because after the war, the Chinese people all hoped for peace, and in order to reduce the suffering of the people, he intended to be tolerant. I thought that Chairman Mao's reason for going to Chongqing at that time might be here, so-called do one's best. But Chiang Kai-shek therefore became arrogant and tore up the agreements signed by both parties.

Now the situation is very different from three years ago. The Chiang Kai-shek dictatorial government has been completely defeated. Everyone knows that this is first of all the result of the struggle of the Chinese Communist Party. However, the Chinese Communist Party has a broad mind and widely invites various democratic parties, people's organizations, and democratic people from all walks of life to jointly discuss the great plan of nation-building. Just as Chairman Mao often said, discuss matters with the masses. Therefore, I have unlimited admiration for the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao.

The victory of this great revolution in the motherland has a great impact on the whole world and also has a great impact on overseas Chinese. Soon after the national liberation and the establishment of a democratic government, the status of overseas Chinese can also be improved, and the wishes of overseas Chinese for the motherland will be realized soon. Overseas Chinese must be very happy to hear the news of the establishment of the preparatory meeting for the New Political Consultative Conference. I believe that after the establishment of the democratic coalition government, the vast majority of overseas Chinese will support the democratic coalition government and support the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao Zedong.

The preparatory work for the New Political Consultative Conference is borne by our twenty-three units, and the responsibility is really very heavy. Our preparatory meeting will discuss the units and numbers of people who will participate in the New Political Consultative Conference in the future, which will naturally be more than the units and numbers of people in the current preparatory meeting. I believe that the selection of representatives to the New Political Consultative Conference should be very cautious, otherwise, rather be short than shoddy. This is a shallow opinion that I put forward for your reference.

I wish this meeting a smooth success!

Long live the People's Republic of China!

    【新华社北平十九日电】毛泽东主席、朱德总司令、李济深先生、沈钧儒先生、郭沫若先生、陈叔通先生、陈嘉庚先生等七人在新政治协商会议筹备会的开幕典礼上的讲词：
    　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　
    （一）毛主席讲词：诸位代表先生们：
    我们的新的政治协商会议的筹备会，今天开幕了。这个筹备会的任务，就是：完成各项必要的准备工作，迅速召开新的政治协商会议，成立民主联合政府，以便领导全国人民，以最快的速度肃清国民党反动派的残余力量，统一全中国，有系统地和有步骤地在全国范围内进行政治的、经济的、文化的和国防的建设工作。全国人民希望我们这样做，我们就应当这样做。
    新的政治协商会议，是中国共产党在一九四八年五月一日向全国人民提议的。这个提议，迅速地得到了全国各民主党派，各人民团体，各界民主人士，国内少数民族和海外华侨的响应。中国共产党、各民主党派、各人民团体、各界民主人士、国内少数民族和海外华侨都认为：必须打倒帝国主义、封建主义、官僚资本主义和国民党反动派的统治，必须召集一个包含各民主党派、各人民团体、各界民主人士、国内少数民族和海外华侨的代表人物的政治协商会议，宣告中华人民民主共和国的成立，并选举代表这个共和国的民主联合政府，才能使我们的伟大的祖国脱离半殖民地的和半封建的命运，走上独立、自由、和平、统一和强盛的道路。这是一个共同的政治基础。这是中国共产党、各民主党派、各人民团体、各界民主人士、国内少数民族和海外华侨团结奋斗的共同的政治基础，这也是全国人民团结奋斗的共同的政治基础。这个政治基础是如此巩固，以至于没有一个认真的民主党派、人民团体和民主人士提出任何不同的意见，大家认为只有这一条道路，才是解决中国一切问题的正确的方向。
    全国人民拥护自己的人民解放军，取得了战争的胜利。这一次伟大的人民解放战争，从一九四六年七月开始，到现在，业已整整三年了。这一次战争是由国民党反动派在获得外国帝国主义的援助之下发动的。国民党反动派背信弃义，撕毁了一九四六年一月的停战协定和政治协商会议的决议，发动了这一次反人民的国内战争。可是，仅仅三年时间，即已被英勇的人民解放军所打败。不久以前，在国民党反动派的和平阴谋被揭穿以后，人民解放军即已奋勇前进，横渡长江。国民党反动派的都城南京，已被夺取。上海、杭州、南昌、武汉、西安，已被解放。现在，人民解放军的各路野战军，正在向南方和西北各省，执行着自有中国历史以来未曾有过的大进军。三个年头中，人民解放军共已消灭反动的国民党军五百五十九万人。截至现时为止，残余的国民党军，包括它的正规部队、非正规部队及后方军事机关军事学校等在内，只有一百五十万人左右了。肃清这一部分残余敌军，还需要一些时间，但已为期不远了。
    这是全中国人民的胜利，也是全世界人民的胜利。整个世界，除了帝国主义者和各国反动派，对于中国人民的这个伟大的胜利，没有不欢欣鼓舞的。中国人民反对自己的敌人的斗争和世界人民反对自己的敌人的斗争，其意义是同一的。全中国人民和全世界人民一齐看见了这样的事实：帝国主义者指挥中国反动派用反革命战争残酷地反对中国人民，中国人民用革命战争胜利地打倒了反动派。
    在这里，我认为有必要唤起人们的注意，这即是：帝国主义者及其走狗中国反动派对于他们在中国这块土地上的失败，是不会甘心的。他们还会要互相勾结在一起，用各种可能的方法，反对中国人民。例如，派遣他们的走狗钻进中国内部来进行分化工作和捣乱工作。这是必然的，他们决不会忘记这一项工作。例如，唆使中国反动派，甚至加上他们自己的力量，封锁中国的海港。只要他们还有可能，他们就会这样做。再则，假如他们还想冒险的话，派出一部分兵力侵扰中国的边境，也不是不可能的。所有这些，我们均必须充分地估计到。我们决不可因为胜利，而放松对于帝国主义分子及其走狗们的疯狂的报复阴谋的警惕性。谁要是放松这一项警惕性，谁就将在政治上解除武装，而使自己处于被动的地位。在这种情况下，全国人民必须团结起来，坚决彻底干净全部地粉碎帝国主义者及其走狗中国反动派的任何一项反对中国人民的阴谋计划。中国必须独立，中国必须解放，中国的事务必须由中国人民自己作主张，自己来处理，不容许任何帝国主义国家再有一丝一毫的干涉。
    中国的革命是全民族人民大众的革命，除了帝国主义者、封建主义者、官僚资产阶级、国民党反动派及其帮凶们而外，其余的一切人都是我们的朋友，我们有一个广大的和巩固的革命统一战线。这个统一战线是如此广大，它包含了工人阶级、农民阶级、小资产阶级和民族资产阶级。这个统一战线是如此巩固，它具备了战胜任何敌人和克服任何困难的坚强的意志和源源不竭的能力。我们现在所处的时代是帝国主义制席走向全部崩溃的时代，帝国主义者业已陷入不可解脱的危机之中，不论他们如何还要继续反对中国人民，中国人民总是有办法取得最后胜利的。
    同时，我们向全世界声明：我们所反对的只是帝国主义制度及其反对中国人民的阴谋计划。任何外国政府，只要它愿意断绝对于中国反动派的关系，不再勾结或援助中国反动派，并向人民的中国采取真正的而不是虚伪的友好态度，我们就愿意和它在平等、互利和互相尊重领土主权的原则基础之上谈判建立外交关系的问题。中国人民愿意与世界各国人民实行友好合作，恢复和发展国际间的通商事业，以利发展生产和繁荣经济。
    诸位代表先生们：我们召集新的政治协商会议成立民主联合政府的一切条件，均已成熟。全中国人民是如此热烈地盼望我们召开会议和成立政府。我相信，我们现在开始的工作，是能够满足这个希望的，并且不需要多久的时间就能满足这个希望。
    中国民主联合政府一经成立，它的工作重点将是：（一）肃清反动派的残余，镇压反动派的捣乱；（二）尽一切可能用极大力量从事人民经济事业的恢复和发展，同时恢复和发展人民的文化教育事业。
    中国人民将会看见，中国的命运一经操在人民自己的手里，中国就将如太阳升起在东方那样，以自己的辉煌的光焰普照大地，迅速地荡涤反动政府留下来的污泥浊水，治好战争的创伤，建设起一个崭新的强盛的名副其实的中华人民民主共和国。
    中华人民民主共和国万岁！
    民主联合政府万岁！
    全国人民大团结万岁！
    （二）朱总司令讲词：
    今天新政治协商会议筹备会开幕了。经过这个筹备会的工作，将要产生一个真正民主团结的新政治协商会议，并经过这个会议去建立一个全国统一的各革命阶级联合专政的人民民主政权。中国的历史，从此将要进入一个新的时代。全国人民都感到万分地兴奋和愉快！
    新政治协商会议筹备会在今天开幕，因为现在召集政治协商会议的一切条件都已经成熟了。在这些条件中间，最重要的就是人民解放军在全国的胜利和国民党反动统治的灭亡。自四月二十一日我军渡江以来，解放了南京、上海、杭州、芜湖、南昌、九江、武昌、汉口等大城市，解放了江苏安徽全省，湖北浙江的大部，江西福建的一部。在其他战场上，我军解放了太原、大同、新乡、安阳、西安、青岛等地。残余的敌人现在虽然还在继续勾结帝国主义企图继续挣扎，但是他们的最后全部消灭已经只是一个时间问题了。
    中国革命的特点之一是“武装的革命反对武装的反革命”。并不是革命者特别喜欢枪杆子，因为不拿起枪杆子，革命的力量就不能生存。这种血的教训使中国的革命者——首先是中国共产党，认识到拿枪杆子的重要。二十余年来，中国人民正由于有了自己的人民解放军，所以帝国主义与反动统治者虽然勾结起来时时刻刻想尽方法要扑杀革命力量，终于不能达到目的。到了今天人民革命战争终于获得了全国的胜利，建立着全国的人民民主政权。这一点历史经验是值得记取的。
    这一枝中国人民的武装力量，是在长期的艰苦的斗争中锻炼出来的。它经历过无数次的考验，也遭受过不少的挫折与失败。但是它从来没有在敌人面前屈服。它在无产阶级及其政党的领导下，在全国人民的拥护与支持下，和敌人进行顽强的战斗，夺取了敌人的装备而装备了自己。今天，这一枝人民武装是空前的壮大起来，成为不可战胜的力量了。
    这一枝人民武装，所以如此壮大，如此英勇善战，就因为它是属于人民的，完全与人民相结合的。它具有高度的政治觉悟，它完全懂得是为谁而战。它是在中国人民领袖毛泽东同志的一整套的政治策略和战略战术的思想指导下而进行战争的。
    人民解放军是中国民主运动的最忠实的支持者，而在现在它就是新政治协商会议及即将成立的民主联合政府的最忠实的支持者。现在，新政治协商会议即将召开，全国人民民主政权即将建立，人民解放军将为这个人民的政府的坚定不移的柱石。当此新政治协商会议筹备会成立之日，我代表中国人民解放军的全体指挥员战斗员预祝筹备会的成功，预祝新政治协商会议的迅速召开，预祝民主联合政府的成立，预祝独立的、民主的、统一的新中国即将出现于世界。
    （三）李济深先生讲词：
    全中国人民，盼望有一个民主的、独立的、和平的、繁荣的中国出现，已经很久了。为了它，牺牲了无数的烈士的头颅鲜血；为了它，牺牲了无数的人民的生命财产。到今天，障碍我们建国的一切反动势力快要完全消灭，我们可以顺利地建立一个符合人民愿望的新中国了。这是何等高兴的事！
    新政治协商会议筹备会，是建设一个符合人民愿望的新中国的开始，我们是以非常的欢欣鼓舞的心情来参加的。这一个开始其实就是一个伟大的革命果实。我们获得这一个革命果实，由于中国共产党二十多年的奋斗和正确的领导，由于中国人民解放军的英勇善战，由于中国人民的牺牲奋斗，由于各方面爱国人士的共同努力。因此，我们要向毛主席和朱总司令致敬，要向中国人民致敬，要向致力民主革命的爱国人士致敬。
    我们要筹备好一个足以代表全国各革命阶层的新政治协商会议，使之能够号召各阶层群众，老的少的，男的女的，团结一起，各尽其能力，为肃清一切反动残余和建设新民主的中国而奋斗到底。
    其次，共同建国纲领和建立中华人民民主共和国政府的方案，是关系全国人民生活的国家大计。我们要深谋远虑地制定切实的草案，使人民所愿望的新中国得以迅速地建立起来。
    总之，筹备会的责任很是重大的，全国人民都引领等待着美丽的结果，我们必须加倍振奋精神，认真地、严肃地在毛主席领导下进行我们的工作！
    （四）沈钧儒先生讲词：
    今天是中国人民的政治协商会议筹备会开幕的日子，这个日子将在中国近代史上留下不可磨灭的伟大纪念。新的政治协商会议筹备会的成立，是表明中国人民革命已经基本上摧毁了蒋介石匪帮的反革命统治，革命的人民解放战争已经基本上奠定了全国胜利的基础。
    钧儒是曾经以中国民主同盟盟员的资格参加过旧的政治协商会议的一分子。从旧的政治协商决议被蒋介石彻底撕毁，到今天新的政治协商会议筹备会开幕之日止，足足经过了三整年的时间。这三整年时间，是用千百万人民的血与泪写成的历史，是中国的革命对于反革命进行最后清算斗争的历史，同时也就是四亿七千五百万人民在中国共产党及伟大人民领袖毛泽东先生领导之下争取彻底解放的历史。
    三年半以前，中国人民因鉴于八年长期抗战，使民生困苦，经济凋敝，达到了极点，才迫切地渴盼着国内的和平，渴盼着真正的民主的和平。为着这个目的，中国共产党，我们中国民主同盟和各民主党派，曾不惜以最大的忍让，与国民党反动政府举行政治协商，而不计较蒋介石过去一切反人民的罪恶。这原是中国人民通过与反动派协调的形式，以争取民主和平的一种仁至义尽的勇敢尝试。然而国民党反动集团，即连这样一种对国家人民有利、对它自身也有利的民主和平的协议，在大家郑重的签订了之后，他们竟悍然单方的撕毁了它，并对为希望这一协议能够实现而斗争的民主进步人士，加以迫害屠杀。我们中国民主同盟就因此牺牲了它最可宝贵的领导者：李公朴、闻一多、陶行知、杜斌丞四先生。残杀民主进步人士之外，他们更进一步发动了违反全国人民意志的全面内战，想杀尽一切反对他们的反动统治的人民。于是人民也就不得不走上武装革命的道路，来为彻底摧毁国民党反动统治，为实现真正的民主与持久的和平而战争。
    新的政治协商会议筹备会，就是在这一伟大的革命战争的胜利基础上召集的。它是这一胜利的逻辑结论。三年半的血的历史经验，证明真正的民主与和平，跟代表帝国主义、封建势力和官僚资产阶级的国民党反动统治，是绝对不能并存的。只有扫除了这一反动统治，实现了全国人民的国家主人翁地位的时候，各阶级、各党派、各团体、各民族的人民大协商，才能保证国家人民所需要的真正民主与持久和平的实现。我们今天开始筹备的新的政治协商会议，正是这样的一种人民的大协商会议。
    今天所开始筹备的这个新政协会议，虽然不是通过全民普选而产生的人民代表大会，但是因为它将尽可能广泛地包括全国各阶级、各党派、各人民团体、乃至各种职业、各种信仰的广大人民的代表，它的实际威信，一定是不亚于一个人民代表大会的。不过为了尽可能真确地反映全国人民的要求，筹备会同仁对于每一议案，必须加以十分慎密地研究和讨论，尤其是对于共同纲领和组织中央联合政府等议案，更须格外慎密地加以研究和讨论。我们一定要制定出一个能反映全国人民要求的施政纲领草案，拟订出一套完全合于革命的新民主主义政治原则的联合政府组织大纲的草案来，以便顺利地进行新民主主义的国家建设，迅速实现独立、民主、和平、统一与富强的中华人民民主共和国。
    历史在中国人民前面所提出的任务，是非常伟大而且艰巨的。它要求我们把一个百余年来依附帝国主义而生存的半殖民地，转变成为一个不仅在政治上，而且在经济文化上彻底独立的国家。它要求我们把封建半封建的支离破碎的落后国家，转变成为一个民主统一的先进国家。它更要求我们把一个贫困衰弱的农业国家，转变成为一个富裕强盛的现代化的工业国家。这些都是比推翻蒋介石统治更为艰巨的任务。为着完成这一些艰巨伟大的历史任务，我们要把新政治协商会议的召集，作为一个伟大的开端。
    钧儒和此次民盟出席代表以及全体盟员均深深地相信，在中国共产党和英明的人民领袖毛主席领导之下，在筹备会全体同人的一致努力之下，我们一定能够胜利地完成历史所赋予我们的使命。
    （五）郭沫若先生讲词：
    今天新政治协商会议筹备会开幕，这在中国历史上，乃至世界史上，应该是划时期的一件大事。
    时局进展得异常迅速。从去年五一，中共中央号召召开新政治协商会议以来，仅仅十三个月的期间，一切的步骤都彷佛在以超音速的速度，而且比以前所预期的规模更加壮阔地逐步实现着。
    单拿参加新政协的代表人数来说，去年所拟议的筹备会代表人数只在二十人左右，而今天参加筹备会的代表是一百三十四人了。仅仅是筹备会，比起四年前国民党反动派所勉强召开的旧政治协商会议，已经大到了四倍以上。将来的新政协正式会，预计会有五百人左右的代表参加，更要大到十六倍以上了。
    旧政协是反动派做主体，反动分子占绝对多数；新政协是革命的民主势力做主体，反动分子是一个也不会参加了。
    因此我感觉着，今天的新政协筹备会的开幕，正好象在黑暗中苦斗着的太阳，经过了漫漫长夜的绞心沥血的努力，终于吐着万丈光芒，以雷霆的步武，冒出地平线上来了。
    我不能不以满怀的热诚，庆贺这新生的太阳出土。我更不能不以满怀的热诚，庆贺这新生的太阳永远上升，永远不会下降。
    这是规模宏大的新民族形式的史诗的序幕，是畸形儿的旧民主主义转换到新民主主义的光荣的开始。
    我们中国在二千多年来的封建统治之下，在一百年来的帝国主义侵袭之下，在三十年来的买办资本主义蠹蚀之下，国家生产落后了，人民受着三重的奴役。一百年来我们的祖先为了抢救落后，免除取役，不屈不挠地作着流血的斗争，然而连旧民主主义形式的革命，一直都是没有得到完成的。
    这在我们今天看来，倒是无须乎惋惜的事了。
    旧民主主义是资产阶级做领导，当它从封建制度蜕化出来，走着上坡路的时候，它的确把生产提高了，满足了一部分人民的民主自由的要求。但等到资产阶级政权一经巩固，一切的生产财富与民主自由便都为资产阶级所垄断，于是便不能不走着反动的下坡路，而成为人民革命的对象。——这是一切旧民主主义的国家所呈现在我们眼前的现实。
    旧民主主义形式的革命在中国未能完成，在今天看来，与其说是不幸，倒无宁是一件幸事了。我们今天在全心全意为人民服务的中国共产党和毛主席的领导之下，在毛主席所提倡的新民主主义的照耀之下，我们将要永远走着上坡路，而永远不会下降了。
    我们以最富于革命性的无产阶级的先锋队做领导，要用全民族的力量来提高生产，要用全民族的力量来保障民主自由，要使革命的成果永远不为特权阶级所垄断，永远不受帝国主义的侵袭，而过渡到社会主义、共产主义的更高阶段。
    这正是新民主主义在本质上优越于旧民主主义的实际。我们为了迅速地完成新民主主义建设的全面胜利，为了迅速地向更高的历史阶段发展，我们全中国的各民主党派，各革命阶层，正应该永远接受中国共产党的坚强领导，在毛主席的胜利的旗帜之下，大踏步地、勇敢地、向前迈进。
    假如我们把眼光更放远大些，我们中国人民的使命在今天是更加重大了。
    我们今天不仅要加强团结，用自己的力量来解决自己的问题，而且还须得和全世界进步的力量密切联系起来，共同解决世界的问题了。我们还须得加强全世界的和平阵线，消除帝国主义的毒焰，以争取全人类的民主自由。
    这也是新民主主义所给予我们的一个远大的指示。
    这是一种爱国的国际主义，和帝国主义者为了掩饰其独霸全世界的阴谋所叫嚣着的所谓“世界主义”，是完全站在对立的地位的。
    帝国主义的“世界主义”是变相法西斯蒂的青一色的统一，一句话归总，便是要使世界成为帝国主义的世界。
    而我们的爱国的国际主义是尊重各民族的独立自主，由各民族的自求进步，更进而通力合作，以求全世界的共同进步。
    这种爱国的国际主义，就譬如是由无数的乐器，无数的音色，无数的演奏者，和谐地所配合成的一部大交响曲。当然，这儿是有一个共同的乐谱的。这个乐谱的母题便是要使全人类的生产，全人类的民主自由，永远不为少数特权阶级或霸道国家所垄断，而永远走着上行阶段。这是三部合成的一部大乐谱，便是由新民主主义而社会主义而共产主义。
    我们中国人民已经经过了一百年的锻炼，在今天是有充分的资格，来担负这部大交响曲的一位卓越的演奏者了。
    我们要永远团结在全心全意为人民服务的中国共产党的周围，在毛主席的英明领导之下，努力发扬新民主主义的爱国精神和爱国的国际主义，加紧完成本民族的解放，并进而促进全人类的大解放。
    新民主主义成功万岁！
    中国人民解放万岁！
    全世界和平民主胜利万岁！
    （六）陈叔通先生讲词：
    今天新政治协商会议筹备会的开幕，在中国历史上是一个划时代的大事件，就在世界历史上也是一个非常光辉而重要的里程碑。叔通能够躬逢其盛，真是感到万分的光荣，万分的欣幸。
    这个会议的开幕，意义是非常重大的。它象征着一个旧时代的终结。那几千年来压迫中国人民的封建统治，那一百多年来侵略中国人民的帝国主义，和二十余年来剥削中国人民的官僚资本主义——这一切反动势力，今天已被中国人民的武装斗争所推翻了，粉碎了。目前，英勇的中国人民解放军正以排山倒海的威力，继续扫荡反革命的残余武装。在这个军事行动终了之后，中国人民所渴望已久的国内统一民主的持久和平就可实现。而这个和平的到来，我们深信，是不会需要很多的时间的。
    这个会议又象征着一个新时代的开始。从今天起，中国人民迈步踏进了有史以来最严肃而重要的时期——即建立我们人民自己的政权的时期。在这个政权领导之下，中国人民将努力建设一个人民民主的新中国，逐步逐步地把我们这个落后的农业国家变成进步的工农业国家，把我们英勇勤劳然而多年来受苦受难的人民最后带进康乐幸福的境界。
    我们今天能够在这个历史名都的北平，召开这样一个具有极重大历史意义的会议，不能不归功于中国人民解放军的不断创造辉煌胜利，不能不归功于全心全意为人民服务的中国共产党的正确领导，不能不归功于伟大人民领袖革命导师毛泽东先生的英明指示。这里，我们应该向人民解放军致敬，向中国共产党致敬，向毛泽东先生致敬。
    “联合工农兵学商各被压迫阶级，各人民团体，各民主党派，各少数民族，各地华侨及其他爱国分子，组成民族统一战线，统一革命事业的领导，打倒蒋介石卖国独裁政权，成立一个在中国共产党领导之下的有各民主党派各人民团体的适当代表人物参加的民主联合政府，宣告中华人民民主共和国的成立。”这是多年来中国共产党所一再宣布的最基本的政治纲领。今天我们新政协筹备会议的举行，就是实现这个纲领的初步措施。相信我们出席新政协的各位同仁，一定能够殚精竭虑，提供最好最妥善的意见和办法，来巩固并且发展中国人民用无量数鲜血所争取到的革命果实。
    摆在我们面前的困难，无疑地是很多很多的。反革命的残余力量还没有完全消灭，帝国主义者还在企图直接地或间接地，公开地或秘密地破坏我们的革命。所以，我们各个民主阶层，民主党派，必须加倍提高警惕，加倍精诚团结，尤其必须诚心诚意接受中国共产党和人民领袖毛泽东先生的领导，加强并巩固我们的民族统一战线，给予民族叛徒以及一切反动分子以致命的打击，并将帝国主义的残余势力从中国境内彻底清除。统一民主势力的斗争，同时就是扫荡反动势力的斗争，就是建设民主独立国家的斗争。没有中国共产党及毛主席的领导，没有各民主党派的团结，是绝不可能取得这一斗争的胜利的。
    当前建国的初步工作，最重要的莫过于发展生产，恢复国民经济水平，替未来的政治经济建设奠定初步基础。在这一个重大而迫切的任务的实现上，我们产业界有最紧要最直接的责任。产业界同人将尽量发挥爱国的创造与牺牲精神，加紧努力，来表现对新政协的热烈支持。
    让我们高高举起人民民主主义民族统一战线的旗帜，在中国共产党及人民领袖毛主席领导之下，紧紧团结在一起，共同奠定民主建设的基础，为建设人民民主的新中国而奋斗！谨在这里，祝颂本会议的成功！
    （七）陈嘉庚先生讲词：
    今天新政治协商会议筹备会正式开幕，是为了邀集各民主党派，各人民团体和各界人士，共同商讨召开新政治协商会议，建立人民联合政府。这是中国历史上一件大事情。是我们世代子孙幸福有关的一件大事情。由于中国共产党毛泽东主席的正确领导，人民解放军的英勇战斗，全中国大部分土地已得到解放，而贪污独裁为全国人民所深恶痛绝的蒋介石反动集团，现在只剩了奄奄一息。海外华侨，无不同声欢庆。本人乘此时机，回到祖国观光和考察，到北平以后，蒙中国共产党毛主席和各民主党派，各人民团体诸领袖，推选为出席筹备会代表。本人自问才识有限，屡辞不获，深感责任非常重大。
    海外华侨盼望祖国和平、民主、统一和富强，十分迫切。但由于蒋介石的狡诈无信，和国民党反动集团的贪污残暴，人民依然得不到翻身。当抗战时期，本人回国慰劳，亲到重庆、延安，看得十分明白。重庆蒋介石政府，只知道搜括民脂民膏，恣意挥霍；而延安毛主席和其他中共领导者，则勤劳刻苦，处处为人民打算。抗战结束之后，旧政协开会，本人当时估计要蒋介石还政于民，等于与虎谋皮，决无成功可能。当时中国共产党毛主席却不避危险，亲到重庆和蒋介石商量合作。毛主席一定明白蒋介石狡诈无诚，推因战后中国人民都盼望和平，为了减少人民的痛苦，有意忍让。本人以为当时毛主席去重庆的原因，也许在此，所谓尽其在我而已。但蒋介石却因此骄纵，把双方同意签订的协定都撕碎了。
    现在形势和三年前大不相同。蒋介石独裁政府，已经整个被打垮。大家都知道这首先是中国共产党奋斗的结果。可是中国共产党虚怀若谷，广邀各民主党派，各人民团体及各界民主人士，来共商建国大计。正如毛主席时常所说的，遇事和群众商量。因此对中国共产党和毛主席，实在无限地钦佩。
    这次祖国大革命的胜利，对全世界极有影响，对海外华侨也有很大影响。不久全国解放，民主政府成立，华侨在海外地位也可提高，华侨对祖国的愿望快实现了。海外华侨听到新政协筹备会成立的消息，一定非常高兴。本人相信民主联合政府成立之后，海外华侨绝大多数都会拥护民主联合政府，拥护中国共产党和毛泽东主席。
    新政治协商会议的筹备工作，由我们二十三个单位负担，责任实在非常重大。我们筹备会要讨论日后参加新政协单位和人数，自然比现在筹备会的单位和人数来得更多。本人以为选择新政协代表，却应十分审慎，否则宁缺毋滥。这是本人所提一点粗浅意见，以供诸位参考。
    谨祝本会顺利地成功！
    中华人民民主共和国万岁！
