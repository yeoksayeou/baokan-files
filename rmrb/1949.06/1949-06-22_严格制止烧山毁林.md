    Strictly Stop Burning Mountains and Destroying Forests
    Since this spring, incidents of burning and destroying mountain forests have continuously occurred in areas such as Chahar South, Yanbei, and Taihang. For example, in Yunu Village, Heshun County, fires broke out four times in a row. In Qingluokou, Wei County, a fire burned for two or three days without being extinguished, and the burned area could extend to a radius of fifty to sixty li. In Huairou, one fire alone destroyed more than 7,500 fruit trees. Although there are various reasons for burning mountains, the most important one is that cadres and the masses lack awareness of banning mountains and protecting forests, so they do not pay attention to prevention before fires occur, and they do not organize to extinguish them in time after fires occur. For example, in the third district of Wutai, eight slopes were burned, but the district did not investigate. This phenomenon should be taken seriously by the leaders of various mountain forest areas. Each county can stipulate regulations or methods for banning mountains and protecting forests to educate the masses to protect mountain forests together. Those who commit serious offenses must also be given penalties such as fines and imprisonment.

    严格制止烧山毁林
    今春以来，察南、雁北、太行等地不断发生烧毁山林事件。如和顺玉女村一连起火四次，蔚县青罗口着火两三天不灭，燃烧面积可延至方圆五六十里，怀柔一次仅果木树即烧毁七千五百多株。烧山原因虽有多端，但最主要的是干部和群众对禁山护林认识不足，以致着火前不注意防止，着火后又不及时组织扑灭，如五台三区烧坡八处，区里竟不加追究，此种现象亟应引起各山林地区的领导者重视，各县可规定禁山护林条例或办法，教育群众大家起来保护山林。对犯错严重者也须给以科罚与徒刑等惩处。          （赵长城）
