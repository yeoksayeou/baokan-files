    Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 20th—The Polish Press Agency reports: The first stage of negotiations between Poland and Italy regarding a new commercial treaty concluded on the 15th with the signing of a trade agreement and a clearing payment agreement. The trade agreement is valid for three years, with a total exchange of goods amounting to 50 million US dollars. Italy will exchange machines, automobile tires, hemp, and citrus fruits for Polish coal, grain, timber, and chemical products. Both delegations are continuing negotiations to conclude a long-term additional agreement so that Poland can exchange coal for Italian capital goods (i.e., means of production, not consumer goods). Financial delegations from the two countries, following recent talks in Geneva, will negotiate financial issues in Warsaw this autumn.
