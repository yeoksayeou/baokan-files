　　Workers of the People's Printing Factory
  　Rushing to Produce "July 1st" Commemorative Stamps
    [Our Newspaper] The North China Postal Administration, in order to commemorate "July 1st," has specially printed "July 1st" commemorative stamps. On June 10th, the China People's Printing Factory was officially entrusted with the printing. When all the workers received this glorious task, they were extremely excited and determined to present the printing of the "July 1st" stamps as a gift to commemorate the birthday of the Communist Party before "July 1st." With unparalleled labor enthusiasm, the workers launched a competition, working overtime to actively rush production, and actually completed more than seventy days of work in twenty days, printing most of the finished products on June 24th.
