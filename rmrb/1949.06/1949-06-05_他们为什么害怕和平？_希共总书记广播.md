Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 4th. Free Greece News Agency reports: General Secretary of the Central Committee of the Greek Communist Party, Zachariadis, delivered a speech on Free Greece Radio entitled "Why Are They Afraid of Peace?"

Zachariadis said: Only the oppressors and exploiters of Greece—the Royalist-Fascist criminals and their American masters—are unwilling to see peace and reconciliation in Greece. For them, war is a tool for getting rich and realizing their plans to enslave the people, a tool for committing crimes against the people. For the Greek people, war brings pain, poverty, and famine. The Royalist-Fascists are afraid of the future after accepting the Soviet proposal, afraid of Greek reconciliation and the future after giving the people the right to free elections. Interior Minister Rentis, who is afraid of free elections, recently said: "The Greek Communist Party must never be allowed to reappear in the country's political life, and all possibility of their appearance (even in a concealed form) on the political stage must be eliminated." But what does Rentis mean by the concealed Communist Party? Is it the 40,000 striking civil servants who are demanding bread? Is it the unemployed who are demanding work? Is it the thousands of Royalist-Fascist soldiers who are unwilling to continue the war and support the Greek Provisional Democratic Government's proposal to restore national peace? Is it the 20,000 government officials or the striking employees of the Athens radio station? Is it the workers who demand bread, the farmers who have been driven out of their hometowns and hope to return? Is it the artisans, small merchants, honest intellectuals, and all the people who are willing to live in peace and tranquility?

The Royalist-Fascist regime and its American masters have divided Greece into two camps: one is the camp of those who plunder and oppress the people with the help of their foreign masters, and the other is the camp of the people who suffer and are devastated. The first camp accounts for 5 percent of the country's population. The second camp accounts for 95 percent, and these are the people. Rentis wants to rule them. He knows that when all these working people can freely decide their own destiny, the Greek Royalist-Fascist regime will finally be eliminated. That is why the Royalist-Fascists do not want peace, why Rentis executes dozens of patriots every day, and wants to exclude the Communist Party from the country's political life. The Royalist-Fascists are carrying out massacres and sabotage because their morale is low. If they believe that the people are on their side, then why do they not agree to free elections?

They do not want an agreement because they are afraid of peace. They are afraid of the people, so they are willing to carry out new massacres. We propose peace because we know that the people are striving for peace. We are not afraid of either war or peace. Whether it is war or peace, we will win.

### 他们为什么害怕和平？　希共总书记广播

　　他们为什么害怕和平？
  　希共总书记广播
    【新华社北平四日电】自由希腊通讯社报道：希腊共产党中央委员会总书记萨查利阿第斯在自由希腊电台发表题为“他们为什么害怕和平？”的演说。
    萨查利阿第斯说：只有希腊的压迫者和剥削者——保皇法西斯罪犯及其美国主子才不愿意希腊安宁与和解。对于他们，战争是发财致富的工具，是实现他们奴役人民计划的、对人民犯罪的工具。对于希腊人民，战争带来痛苦、贫困与饥馑。保皇法西斯害怕接受了苏联建议后的前途，害怕希腊和解和给予人民以自由选举权利后的前途。害怕自由选举的内政部部长伦蒂斯最近说道：“永远不容许希腊共产党再出现于国家的政治生活中，并且必须取消他们在政治舞台上出现（即使是以隐蔽的形式）的一切可能性。”但是，伦蒂斯说的隐蔽的共产党是什么意思呢？是要求面包的四万名罢工的公务员吗？是要求工作的失业者吗？是不愿意继续战争、而支持希腊临时民主政府关于恢复全国和平建议的千千万万保皇法西斯军士兵吗？是二万政府机关的职员或雅典无线电台罢工的职员吗？是那些要求面包的职工、被从家乡赶出来而又希望回去的农民吗？是工匠、小商人、诚实的知识分子和一切愿意在和平与安宁中生活的人民吗？
    保皇法西斯政权及其美国主子，把希腊分成两个阵营：一个是取得他们外国主子的帮助而掠夺与压迫人民者的阵营，一个是受苦难和被摧残的人们的阵营。第一个阵营占全国人口百分之五。第二个阵营占百分之九十五，这些都是人民。伦蒂斯想统治的就是他们。他知道当所有这些劳动人民可以自由地决定他们的命运的时候，希腊保皇法西斯政权便将最后归于消灭。这就是为什么保皇法西斯不要和平，为什么伦蒂斯每天枪毙数十名爱国分子，并且想把共产党排斥于国家政治生活之外。保皇法西斯进行屠杀和破坏，是因为他们的士气已在低落。如果他们相信人民是站在他们方面的话，那么为什么他们不同意自由选举呢？
    他们不要协议，因为他们害怕和平。他们害怕人民，因而不惜进行新的屠杀。我们建议和平，因为我们知道人民正在力求和平。我们既不怕战争，也不怕和平。不论战争与和平，我们都要获得胜利。
