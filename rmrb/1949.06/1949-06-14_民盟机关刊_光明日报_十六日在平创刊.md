　　MENG Organ Paper "Guangming Daily" to be Launched in Peiping on the 16th
　　[Peiping News] The organ paper of the China Democratic League (MENG), the Guangming Daily, will be launched in Peiping on the 16th. The League, since its establishment in 1941, has been persecuted by the Kuomintang reactionaries, causing the League's first daily newspaper, Guangming Bao, to be published in Hong Kong. Unfortunately, shortly after its publication for over three months, Hong Kong was invaded by Japanese寇, and Guangming Bao was also forced to cease publication in the flames of war. After the Japanese 寇 surrendered in 1945, Guangming Bao was changed to a semi-monthly publication in Hong Kong until now. Recently, the MENG headquarters decided to establish the Guangming Daily in Peiping and specially appointed Zhang Bojun, Hu Yuzhi, Liu Wang Liming, Lin Zhongyi, and Sa Kongliao as members of the Guangming Daily's editorial board, with Zhang Bojun as the president, Hu Yuzhi as the editor-in-chief, and Lin Zhongyi as the general manager.

　　民盟机关刊“光明日报”十六日在平创刊
    【平市讯】中国民主同盟机关刊——光明日报将于十六日在平创刊。该盟于一九四一年建立之初，即受到国民党反动派的迫害，致民盟的第一张日报——光明报，不得不在香港出版。不幸出版后甫逾三月香港被日寇侵陷，光明报亦在炮火中被迫停刊。一九四五年日寇投降后，光明报在港改出半月刊以迄于今。最近民盟总部决定在平创办光明日报，特推出章伯钧、胡愈之、刘王立明、林仲易、萨空了等为光明日报社务委员，并推定章伯钧任社长、胡愈之任总编辑，林仲易任总经理。
