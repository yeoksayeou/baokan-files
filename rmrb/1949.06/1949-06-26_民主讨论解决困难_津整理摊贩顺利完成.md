　　Democratic Discussion Solves Difficulties
  　Tianjin Successfully Completes Vendor Reorganization
    [Tianjin Electric] The work of reorganizing street vendors in Tianjin began in mid-May, and now the major vendor markets have been registered, relocated, and reorganized one after another. The reorganization steps generally involve first arranging the vendors' stalls on the spot, then reviewing and registering them, grouping them by number, demarcating areas, and relocating the markets. At the beginning of the reorganization, some vendors evaded the process because they did not understand the government's policies. However, after repeated explanations and education, their concerns were dispelled, and some practical difficulties were resolved, allowing the work to proceed smoothly. When moving to new markets, most decisions were made after soliciting the opinions of the vendors through democratic discussions. However, when moving markets, some individual cadres did not analyze and adopt the opinions of the vendors, but simply emphasized city appearance and management, without taking into account the vendors' business conditions, which caused dissatisfaction. After this phenomenon was discovered, it was quickly corrected, allowing the initial reorganization of the vendors to be completed smoothly. After the reorganization, the city's traffic order has gradually returned to normal. At the same time, due to the mobilization of landlords fleeing to their home villages to engage in production during the review and registration process, as well as persuading small-scale merchants to return to storefront operations, the number of vendors in the city has been greatly reduced.

　　民主讨论解决困难
  　津整理摊贩顺利完成
    【天津电】津市整理摊贩工作从五月中旬开始，现各主要摊贩市场已先后登记、迁移整理完毕。整理步骤，一般是先使摊贩就地按排摊位，然后审查登记，分组编号，划定地区，迁移市场。开始整理时，部分摊贩因为不了解政府政策，曾发生逃避现象；但经反复解释教育，消除了顾虑，解决了某些实际困难，遂使工作得以顺利进行。在迁移新市场时，大多是预先通过摊贩民主讨论，征求他们对于新市场的意见，然后作出决定。但在移动市场时，也有个别干部不分析采纳摊贩的意见，只单纯的强调市容与管理，而没有照顾到摊贩的营业情况，以致引起不满。此种现象经发觉后，已很快得到纠正，使摊贩的初步整理得以顺利完成。经过整理，现全市交通秩序已逐渐纳入正轨；同时由于审查登记时结合动员流亡地主还乡生产，及劝导化整为零的座商返回门市营业，全市摊贩数目已大为减少。
