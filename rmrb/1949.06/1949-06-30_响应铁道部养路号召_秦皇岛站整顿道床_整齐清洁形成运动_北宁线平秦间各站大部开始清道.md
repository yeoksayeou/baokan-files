Responding to the Ministry of Railways' Call to Maintain Railways
  Qinhuangdao Station Rectifies Roadbeds, Cleanliness and Order Form a Movement
    Most Stations Between Pingjin on the Beining Line Begin Cleaning Tracks
    [Special Dispatch from this Newspaper] This newspaper reporter Chen Yongjin reports on the situation of all railway employees at Qinhuangdao Station on the Beining Line actively maintaining roads and cleaning ballast: Railway employees at Qinhuangdao Station initiated a movement to rectify the roadbed using their spare time on May 11th. Ten units, including the station, locomotive depot, inspection depot, telecommunications section, engineering section, public security section, Fulin School, railway clinic, supply cooperative, and trade union, actively participated in this work. Before the work started, everyone fully discussed and deliberated, and the employees made competitive challenges to each other, ensuring the early completion of the roadbed rectification. In their work, they patiently used iron sieves to remove soil and dirt, and neatly laid the stones. The roadbeds assigned to the station and locomotive depot employees contained more garbage, and everyone was determined to completely remove it, transporting more than 20 cartloads of dirt. They fully demonstrated the labor posture of masters in their work. More than 50-year-old grandmothers also actively participated in this work. Some insisted on working despite illness and rain without resting. Female employees of the telecommunications section started working at 5 p.m. because they did not have tools, and worked until 12 p.m. Fulin School (i.e., the railway workers' children's school) cleaned the first track exceptionally neatly and cleanly. Many employees, women, teachers, and students developed blisters on their hands during their work, but persisted throughout.
    The road maintenance work at Qinhuangdao Station was praised by railway employees in Tianjin, Tangshan, Guye, and other places, who proposed to learn from Qinhuangdao Station, which further aroused the enthusiasm of Qinhuangdao Station employees for road maintenance. Under the slogans of preventing roadbed decay, supporting the army, increasing production, and reducing the burden on the people, after several days of deliberation, a second movement to rectify the roadbed was launched. More than 600 employees participated. The Qinhuangdao Station extends from Tianqiao in the east to Zhuandong in the west, with a total length of 13,200 meters for the main and side lines. Each person was assigned an average of 19 meters, and it was stipulated that the width of the ballast should not exceed 2.5 meters from the center of the track to both sides, and the height should not exceed the top of the sleepers. They used their spare time, under the principle of not delaying regular work, and ended the movement on June 24. In order to summarize and inspect this work, a "Roadbed Rectification Evaluation Committee" was established, and six model selection conditions were established. Recently, in response to the Ministry of Railways' call to maintain roads, a third movement to carry out roadbed rectification was launched on June 26. The nearly 16 kilometers of lines within Qinhuangdao Station, with the dirty things left over from the Japanese puppet period and the Kuomintang bandits, will be completely cleaned up by the employees.
    [News from this Newspaper] In order to respond to the Ministry of Railways' call for "all engineering and workers to strengthen road maintenance work," railway employees on the Beining Line, from Beiping to Qinhuangdao, have mostly begun actively cleaning work at various stations. Qinhuangdao Station has launched three waves of roadbed rectification since May, and the dirty soil on the roadbed will soon be completely cleared. At Beiping East Station, from the head of the station to the workers, they have begun to remove weeds in the station during their spare time, and ballast cleaning is also gradually underway. Other stations such as Tianjin, Tangshan, Tanggu, Changli, Beidaihe, and Junliangcheng have sleepers and ballast mostly sunk in the soil, a situation similar to Qinhuangdao Station a month ago. The employees also have the same enthusiasm to sort them out, and the relevant leadership should immediately actively lead this movement.

　　响应铁道部养路号召
  　秦皇岛站整顿道床  整齐清洁形成运动
    北宁线平秦间各站大部开始清道
    【本报特讯】本报记者陈勇进报导北宁线秦皇岛车站全体铁路职工积极养路清理道碴之情形称：秦皇岛车站铁路员工自五月十一日即发起利用工余时间整顿道床的运动，车站、机务段、检车段、电务段、工务段、公安段、扶轮学校、铁路分诊所、供应社、职工会等十个单位均积极参加这一工作。工作未开始之前，经过大家充分讨论与酝酿，职工们互相提出竞赛挑战，保证了整顿道床早日完成。他们在工作中耐心地用铁筛子把泥土与脏物筛去，将石子整齐的铺好。车站、机务段职工分配的道床所含垃圾较多，大家决心彻底清除，共运出二十余车脏土。他们在工作中充分的表现了主人翁的劳动姿态。有五十多岁的大娘亦积极参加这一工作。有的带病冒雨坚持工作而不休息。电务段的女职工因没有工具，等到下午五点才开始工作，一直作到深夜十二点钟。扶轮学校（即铁路职工子弟学校）所清理的第一股道异常整齐清洁。不少职工、妇女、教师、学生在工作中将手磨出了血泡，始终坚持。
    秦皇岛车站的养路工作曾得到天津、唐山、古冶等地铁路职工的称赞，并提出向秦皇岛车站看齐，这更加引起秦皇岛车站职工们养路的热情。在防止道木磨朽、支援大军、增进生产、减轻人民负担的口号下，经过几日的酝酿，又掀起了第二次整顿道床的运动。参加的职工六百余人。秦皇岛车站东起天桥、西至砖洞正线及侧线全长一万三千二百米，平均每人分担十九米，并规定石碴宽度从轨道中心起向两边延布不得超出二·五米，高度不得超过枕木上面，他们以工余之暇，在不耽误经常工作的原则下，于六月二十四日结束这一运动。为了总结与检查这一工作，并成立了“整理道床评判委员会”，订出六项选举模范条件。最近为了响应铁道部养路的号召，于六月二十六日发动第三次开展整理道床的运动。秦皇岛车站内将近十六公里的线路由日伪时期与国民党匪帮所遗留下的肮脏东西，将被职工们彻底清除。
    【本报讯】北宁线铁路职工为了响应铁道部“全体工务、职工加强养路工作”的号召，从北平至秦皇岛间，各车站大部开始积极清理工作，秦皇岛车站从五月开始至今已发动三次整理道床的热潮，道床上的脏土即将全部清理完毕。北平东站从总站长到工人，已开始在工余时间将站内之杂草拔除，清碴工作也逐步进行。其他如天津、唐山、塘沽、昌黎、北戴河、军粮城等站枕木、石碴大都陷入泥土中，情况与一月以前的秦皇岛站相同，职工也有同样的热情加以整理，有关的领导方面应即积极领导这一运动。
