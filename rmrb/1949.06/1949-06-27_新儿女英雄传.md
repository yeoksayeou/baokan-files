  　Chapter Fourteen: The Mystery of Marriage (Continued 1)
    Three

    Through continuous struggle and education, the puppet soldiers have become much more disciplined than before. A folk song circulated in the village:

    The Eighth Route Army comes in the dark of night,
    The Eighth Route Army comrades are closer than brothers;
    Mao blue jacket,
    Purple flower pants,
    Head wrapped in a white sheep's belly.
    As soon as the comrades arrive, there's no worry,
    The enemy doesn't dare to leave the watchtower...

    (Note: Purple flower cloth is yellow; white sheep's belly is a white towel.)

    However, the newly transferred puppet captain—nicknamed "Big Crow"—was still acting wildly. He would go to the tavern to drink, the butcher shop to weigh meat, and whatever he bought, he wouldn't pay for it. He even loudly cursed the Eighth Route Army, saying, "The Eighth Route Army has been wiped out by the Japanese soldiers, what's there to fear!"

    Several activists from the village's secretly re-established Peasants' Association and Youth League, secretly discussed with Niu Dashui; one night, they waited for Big Crow to come out, suddenly blocked him in an alley, pointed a gun at him and said, "What leopard's gall did you eat, daring to cause trouble? You say there's no Eighth Route Army, but the Eighth Route Army is right here! If you submit to the Eighth Route Army, you must treat the people well!" Niu Dashui also pointed out all the bad things he had said and done. Big Crow was so scared he couldn't stand straight, bowing and saying, "My eyes are big but I have no pearls, I don't understand people! You know everything I do and say; you're watching a turtle through glass. I'll never dare to mess around again!"

    The group educated him for a long time before returning his gun and letting him go back to the tower.

    From then on, Big Crow never dared to act recklessly again. The watchtower followed our regulations. Sometimes, when Black Cai came to the village to inspect work, he would send someone to call Big Crow out, constantly educating him and correcting him.

    Once, Big Crow's bodyguard stole an old lady's lined jacket, and the old lady reported it to the Women's Rescue Association. At night, the Women's Rescue Association gathered dozens of women and shouted from the rooftop opposite the watchtower: "Puppet soldiers! Have you forgotten the regulations set by the Eighth Route Army? You can't harm the people!" Big Crow shouted from the watchtower: "Aunties, what do you want to say?" The women shouted: "Why did your bodyguard steal Aunt Zhao's lined jacket? Return it to her immediately! Otherwise, our Women's Rescue Association won't let it go!" The next day, the jacket was indeed returned to its owner.

    After the situation in Shenjia Village opened up, Black Cai asked Niu Dashui and Yang Xiaomei to come to him for a talk. He wanted to transfer Niu Dashui to open up Hezhuang, with Xiaomei taking over Dashui's position to manage the work in Shenjia Village; he asked them for their opinions. They both happily accepted.

    Black Cai saw them sitting side by side on the edge of the kang, a perfect pair, and felt an unspeakable fondness in his heart. He said with a beaming smile, "Dashui, Xiaomei, you are both good comrades; one divorced a long time ago, and the other hasn't married yet. I think you two are very suitable; I'll be your matchmaker. You should get to know each other first, and think about it carefully. What do you think?"

    Dashui's heart was pounding, thinking, "Ha, we've been working together for so many years, don't I already know her!" Xiaomei's face was flushed, and she thought, "Hehe, I know his thoughts and temperaments like the back of my hand, what's there to get to know!" Although they thought so in their hearts, they were too embarrassed to say it out loud.

    Dashui spoke first: "I have no objections! I have a very good impression of Comrade Yang Xiaomei. She is very active in her work, running around and never idle; she is also very caring to comrades; she didn't compromise even when her family was holding her back before. Anyway, she's very good! I can't really put my finger on it..." Xiaomei smiled and said to him, "Come on! I have a lot of shortcomings, none of which can compare to you!" Then she said to Black Cai, "As for Comrade Niu Dashui, I very much agree with him. He is too good. He has a very firm stance; even after the enemy tormented him like that, he didn't surrender. He is very capable at work, and he studies better than me. I have no objections to him!"

    Black Cai couldn't help but laugh heartily after hearing them, saying, "Good, good, good! The comrades in the county committee all want to introduce you two, and when the environment gets better, you can get married! Now, focus on your work and don't rush!" What he said went straight into Dashui and Xiaomei's hearts, and they both blushed and smiled shyly.

    Xiaomei arrived at Shenjia Village and lived in Uncle Li's house. She came out every night to work, leading the grassroots mass work, and often disguised herself to go to Shen Yaozong's house. According to instructions from above, she kept tabs on this puppet chief, secretly helping us; as soon as she got information, she handed it over to the liaison to send it to the organization.

    As time went on, Xiaomei became less wary in Shen Yaozong's house. Who knew that one night, the platoon leader of Xieliu Village watchtower, Fan Ye, passed by Shenjia Village and remembered that Guo San Mazi had said that Shen Yaozong had a set of ivory mahjong tiles. He wanted them, so he came to find Shen Yaozong. The guard stood outside the door, and he suddenly barged in alone. Xiaomei was talking with Shen Yaozong in the room. She was caught off guard and stood up in a panic, her heart pounding, her face flushed, and she looked at Shen Yaozong with her eyes. Shen Yaozong was anxious, but on the surface he calmly said, "Sir, please sit down, please sit down!" Fan Ye stared at Xiaomei and asked Shen Yaozong, "This... who is she?" Shen Yaozong quickly said, "This is my niece, no outsiders. Sir, please sit down!" Fan Ye sat down. Xiaomei said to Shen Yaozong, "I'll go and ask my aunt to boil some water." After speaking, she quickly slipped out.

    Platoon Leader Fan Ye watched her leave the door, still squinting his eyes, staring blankly at the doorway; after a while, he turned his face, laughing strangely and saying, "Your niece, this one!" He raised a thumb, and laughed loudly. Because Yang Xiaomei was often not exposed to the sun, her skin was very white. Just now, her face flushed red, and the Japanese saw that she was very pretty; and when he saw Xiaomei's pair of bright black eyes, he had already been captivated and fascinated.

    Shen Yaozong secretly squeezed a handful of sweat and started chatting with Fan Ye, trying to divert his attention to other things. But after asking him a few questions, he seemed not to hear, and said, "How old is your niece?" Shen Yaozong thought, "This is bad! I'll say she's older." So he blurted out, "Twenty-five years old! Have you gone to the watchtower, sir?" Fan Ye wrinkled his red nose, smiled foolishly, and said, "Me," he held out both hands, flipping them, counting one ten, twenty, thirty. Shen Yaozong nodded and said, "Oh, oh, oh, sir is thirty years old." The Japanese platoon leader sat for a while, absent-minded. He even forgot about the mahjong tiles and left.

    The next day, Platoon Leader Fan Ye asked the "translator" to find Shen Yaozong, bringing a watch, a ring; two bolts of silk; saying that the Japanese platoon leader had taken a fancy to his niece and wanted to marry her. Shen Yaozong declined, saying that his niece was already engaged. But the "translator" said that Platoon Leader Fan Ye had instructed that, no matter what, he had to marry her, and she had to be sent to Xieliu Village the day after tomorrow; if he didn't do it, he would arrest Shen Yaozong's whole family. After speaking, the "translator" left the things and left.

    Shen Yaozong wrung his hands in worry, pacing back and forth. Even though he had many tricks, he couldn't come up with a solution. When Xiaomei heard about this, she also broke out in a sweat in anxiety. She hurried back to the organization to discuss it. Shen Yaozong didn't dare let her go. Xiaomei was both anxious and angry: "If you don't let me go, what do you want? Do you still want to send me to the Japanese? If you really dare to do that, the Eighth Route Army won't spare you!" Shen Yaozong stomped his feet and said, "Isn't this killing me? People are forcing me to hand over people, what can I do! You know Platoon Leader Fan Ye, if he turns his face, he'll chop, this is not a joke!" Xiaomei comforted him with kind words: "Don't worry! I'll go back and slowly think of a way, anyway, I can't let you take the blame, can I?" After talking for a long time, Xiaomei managed to get away.

    Xiaomei returned to Dayang Village, where Black Cai and the comrades were chatting about how to deal with the Japanese in Xieliu Village. The work in Xieliu Village was personally opened up by Black Cai, and the mass organizations had already been restored; through legal struggles, the Baozhang had also been replaced by our people; and we had also controlled the puppet soldiers on the watchtower, but those dozens of Japanese soldiers were strictly monitoring the puppet soldiers, and they were holding two machine guns in their hands, so there was no way to take the watchtower for the time being. That Platoon Leader Fan Ye was both cunning and ruthless, often saying on the surface: "Great Japan and China are one family, the Imperial Army is here to save you people!" But when he glared his eyes, he was very ferocious! He killed quite a few Chinese people; he also liked to do it himself, ordering the soldiers to take a basin of cold water and pour it on a person's neck, then he would raise his knife and chop off the head with a *snap*. He also said: "Japan pities the Chinese people, otherwise, they would have been wiped out long ago!"

    When Xiaomei told the comrades about her encounter with Fan Ye, everyone started yelling in anger. Black Cai told everyone to calm down and think of some good ways. They studied for a long time before coming up with a plan, and decided to call Shen Yaozong to Dayang Village to talk to him. Shen Yaozong was very afraid and hesitated to agree. They left him there at the time and sent someone to Xieliu Village to send a message, saying that Shen Yaozong's niece's family had already agreed, and they would definitely send her on the appointed day; the comrades all busied themselves preparing. Black Cai also personally went to Xieliu Village to make arrangements.

　　新儿女英雄传

  　第十四回　结婚的谜（续一）
    三
    经过不断的争取和教育，伪军们比以前规矩得多了。村里流传着这样的歌谣：
    黑间来了八路军，
    八路军同志比弟兄还亲；
    毛蓝褂，
    紫花裤，
    头上蒙着白羊肚。
    同志一来诂没头，
    敌人不敢下岗楼……
    （注：紫花布，黄色；白羊肚就是白手巾。）
    可是，新调来的伪队长——外号“大老鸹”的——还邪火。他到酒店喝酒，肉铺称肉，不论买什么东西，都不给钱。还＠＠＠的大骂八路军，说“八路军给日本兵打光了，怕个屌！”
    村里秘密恢复起来的农会青会几个积极分子，背地和牛大水商量好；有一天夜里，瞅大老鸹出来，突然把他堵在一个胡同里，用枪指着他说：“你吃了什么豹子胆，敢发坏？你说没有八路军，眼下就有八路军！你要是服八路军，你就得好好儿对待老百姓！”牛大水还把他说的坏话，作的坏事儿，全给指出来。大老鸹吓得直不起腰，打躬作揖的说：“是我眼大没珠子，不懂人事！我干什么说什么，你们全知道；你们是隔着玻璃瞧王八呢。往后我再不敢胡闹了！”
    大伙儿教育他半天，才把他的枪还给他，放他回楼。
    从这以后，大老鸹再不敢发横了。岗楼上都按咱们规定的行事。有时候，黑老蔡到村里检查工作，就派人把大老鸹叫出来，随时教育他，纠正他。
    有一次，大老鸹的护兵偷了一位大娘的夹袄儿，大娘告到妇救会。夜里，妇救会集合了好几十个娘们，坐在岗楼对面的房顶上喊话：“伪军同胞们！八路军给订的那些规程，你们忘记啦？你们糟害老百姓可不行！”大老鸹在岗楼上喊：“婶子大娘们，有什么话你们说吧！”妇女们喊：“怎么你的护兵偷赵大娘的夹袄儿？马上还给人家！要不，我们妇救会就不依！”第二天，那夹袄果然就还给原主了。

    申家庄局面打开以后，黑老蔡找牛大水杨小梅到他那儿去谈谈。他想调牛大水开辟何庄，由小梅接替大水，掌握申家庄的工作；问他们有什么意见。他两个都很乐意的接受了。
    黑老蔡看他俩并排坐在炕沿上，刚好一对儿，心里说不出的喜爱。他笑迷迷的说：“大水小梅啊，你们俩都是好同志；一个早离了婚，一个到现在还没娶。我看你两个挺合适；我给你们俩当个介绍人吧。你们先互相了解了解，好好儿考虑一下。你们看怎么样？”
    大水心里扑通扑通的跳，想着：“哈，一块儿出来工作了这么些年，我还不了解她呀！”小梅脸儿通红，心里也想：“嘻，他什么心眼儿，什么脾性儿，我早摸得熟透透的啦，还用得着了解！”他俩心里虽然这么想，嘴里可不好意思说出来。
    还是大水先开口说：“我没有意见！我对杨小梅同志，印象很好。她工作挺积极，东奔西跑，多会儿也不闲着；对同志又挺关心；以前家里拉后腿，也不妥协。反正她挺好！我也说不上来……”小梅笑着对他说：“得了吧！我的缺点儿挺多，哪一样也比不上你！”又对黑老蔡说：“我对牛大水同志，我挺赞成他。他太好。他，立场挺坚决；敌人把他拾掇成那么个样儿，他也不投降。工作上挺有一套，学习也比我好。我对他什么意见也没有！”
    黑老蔡听他们说完，忍不住哈哈大笑，说：“好好好！县委上的同志都想给你俩介绍，等环境再好一些，你们就可以结婚啦！现在好好儿安心工作，别着急！”他说进大水小梅的心眼里去了，他俩都成了大红脸儿，挺难为情的笑了。
    小梅到了申家庄，住在李二叔家里，每天晚上出来活动，领导下层群众工作，还经常化了装，到申耀宗家里去，根据上级的指示，掌握这个伪大乡长，暗里给咱们办事；一拿到情报，就交给交通员送到机关上去。
    日子长了，小梅在申耀宗家也就不提防了。谁知道有一天晚上，斜柳村岗楼上的饭野小队长路过申家庄，想起郭三麻子说过，申耀宗有一付象牙的麻将牌，心里想要，就来找申耀宗。护兵在门外站着，他一个人突然闯进来。小梅可正和申耀宗在屋里谈话呢。她一时躲不及，惊忙的站起来，心又跳，脸又红，用眼睛瞅着申耀宗。申耀宗心里着忙，表面上镇静的说：“太君，请坐请坐！”那饭野紧盯着小梅，问申耀宗：“这个……什么人？”申耀宗忙说：“这是我的外甥女儿，没有外人。太君请坐吧！”饭野坐下了。小梅对申耀宗说：“我去和妗子烧点水来。”说完，忙溜出去了。
    饭野小队长一直看她出了门，还眯缝着眼儿，对门口出神的望着；一会儿才转过脸来，怪声怪气的笑着说：“你的外甥女儿，这个的！”他翘起一个大拇指，哈哈哈的大笑起来。原来杨小梅经常晒不着太阳，皮肤很白，刚才脸儿一红，鬼子看她挺漂亮；又见了小梅那一对黑亮亮的大眼睛，他早就眼馋，着迷了。
    申耀宗暗暗的捏着一把汗，就跟饭野扯话把子，想把他的注意转到旁的事上去。可是问了他几句，他好象没听见似的，说：“你的外甥女儿，多少年纪？”申耀宗心里想：“这可是坏了！我往大处说。”就随口答：“二十五岁啦！太君到岗楼上去了没有？”饭野缩了缩红鼻子，傻笑着说：“我的，”他伸出两只手，翻着，一十、二十、三十的比划。申耀宗点头说：“哦哦哦，太君三十岁啦。”鬼子小队长心神不定的坐了一阵。连麻将牌都忘了要，就走了。
    第二天，饭野小队长托“翻译官”来找申耀宗，带来一只手表，一个戒指；两匹绸缎；说日本小队长看中了他的外甥女儿，要娶她。申耀宗推托外甥女儿已经出聘了。可是“翻译官”说饭野小队长关照的，不论怎么着，非娶不行，后天就得送到斜柳村去；如果不着办，就要把申耀宗一家人抓起来。说完，“翻译官”留下东西，就走了。
    申耀宗愁的直搓手，出来进去的乱转。尽管他心眼儿多，也变不出法儿来了。小梅来听说了这个事，也急出了一身汗。忙着要回机关去商量。申耀宗可不敢放她走。小梅又是急，又是气：“你不叫我走怎么着？难道你还想把我送给鬼子啊。你真敢这么作，八路军也饶不了你！”申耀宗跺脚说：“这不叫我难死啦？人家逼着跟我要人，我可怎么办！饭野小队长你也知道，一翻脸，说砍就砍了，这可不是闹着玩儿的！”小梅又用好话安慰他：“你先别急！我回去慢慢想办法，反正不能让你背了害，还不成啊？”说了半天，小梅才脱身走了。
    小梅回到大杨庄，黑老蔡和同志们正在闲谈：怎么对付斜柳村的鬼子。斜柳村的工作是黑老蔡亲自去开辟的，群众组织已经恢复起来了；经过了合法的斗争，保长也换成了咱们的人；还掌握了岗楼上的伪军，只有那几十个鬼子对伪军监视得挺严，有两挺机枪也攒在鬼子们手里，一时没法把岗楼拿下。那饭野小队长又刁又狠，嘴头上常说：“大日本和中国是一家子，皇军是来救你们老百姓的！”可是他眼睛一鼓，凶恶多了！他杀的中国人真不少；还喜欢亲自动手，叫兵们拿一盆凉水，往人脖子上一泼，他举起刀，嚓的一下就把头砍了。还说：“日本可怜中国人，要不，早杀绝了！”
    小梅把碰见饭野的事儿，跟同志们一说，大家都气呼呼的嚷嚷开了。黑老蔡叫大伙儿冷静下来，好好儿想些办法。他们研究了老半天，才想出个招儿，定了个计划，先把申耀宗叫到大杨庄，跟他谈。申耀宗很害怕，支支吾吾的不敢答应。当时就把他留下，另外派人给斜柳村送信，说申耀宗外甥女的家里已经应承了，到日子一准送去；同志们都纷纷忙忙的准备起来。黑老蔡还亲自到斜柳村去布置。
    （未完）
