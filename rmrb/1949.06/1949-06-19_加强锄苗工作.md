Strengthen Weeding Work
Agricultural Department of the North China People's Government

　　The function of weeding is to remove weeds, loosen the soil, allow air to circulate in the soil, supply oxygen and nitrogen to the roots of crops, promote soil decomposition and bacterial activity, increase soil fertility, prevent moisture evaporation, prevent drought and alkali, and reduce pests, thereby making crops grow vigorously. As the saying goes, "Plow three times, harrow four times, and weed eight times, and you won't need a mill to thresh the grain"; "Weed millet when it has two ears, weed corn when it's about to emerge from the ridge"; "Weed the seedlings when they are an inch tall, top with manure." More weeding can increase production, which is well known to farmers. Therefore, this year's agricultural production plan for North China emphasizes more plowing and weeding, requiring the old areas to restore weeding to pre-war levels and the new areas to weed two to three times.

　　This year, North China has been completely liberated, and war duties have been greatly reduced, allowing farmers to concentrate on production. In addition, the land reform in the old liberated areas has generally been completed, and the farmers' enthusiasm for production is high. Fifty percent of rural women have also been mobilized to participate in agricultural production. Therefore, this year there are sufficient conditions and material basis to complete the restoration of pre-war weeding levels in the old areas. We must have firm confidence in completing it.

　　Based on the current situation in various regions, we propose the following suggestions for this year's weeding:

　　1. It must be done in a timely manner: As the saying goes, "Better late planting than late weeding"; "Weed millet when it has two ears, weed corn when it's about to emerge from the ridge"; "Weed the seedlings when they are an inch tall, top with manure." Currently, it is the weeding season, and all regions should have a good grasp of the local weeding season and lead the work in a timely manner.

　　2. Be good at organizing the workforce: Weeding work is suitable for mutual assistance, because some seedlings are only suitable for weeding in the morning and evening, some seedlings can also be weeded during the midday, and some land is not suitable for weeding immediately after rain. In this way, we can adjust and exchange work with each other, but the mutual aid groups should not be too large or too concentrated, because weeding is a rush job, and being too concentrated may often cause us to lose sight of one thing while attending to another. Also, weeding can widely mobilize female and child labor to participate, but we must pay attention to fine weeding. Seeking only speed without quality will not only be useless but also harmful to the crops.

　　3. Promote the use of animal-drawn weeders as much as possible: Because weeding cannot use animal power, it causes a shortage of manpower during the weeding season and idle animal power, which can easily lead to missed opportunities and wasteland. If we can improve agricultural tools and use animal power, weeding can not only be restored but also exceed pre-war levels. Along the Jinpu Railway in central and southern Hebei, a type of animal-drawn weeder is widely used. One person and one animal can weed fifteen mu of land a day. If one person pulls the animal and one person guides the plow, they can weed twenty mu, which is five times more efficient than manual weeding, greatly saving labor. Therefore, the weeding level in these areas has not decreased in recent years. This agricultural tool is far from being popularized in North China, and all regions should try their best to promote it to improve weeding efficiency. However, this is a method of improving agricultural tools and is only suitable for plains. Mountainous areas should seek other improvement methods.

　　加强锄苗工作
    华北人民政府农业部
    锄地的作用，是锄去杂草，使土地疏松，流通土壤中空气，供给庄稼根部以氧气，氮气，促进土壤分解及细菌活跃，增加土壤肥力，并可阻止水分蒸发，防旱防碱，减少虫害，而使作物生长旺盛。农谚说：“耕三、耙四、锄八遍，打下粮食不用碾”；“锄耧八遍，八米二糠”，多锄可以增产，这是农民所熟知的，因此今年华北区农业生产计划，强调多耕多锄，要求老区锄苗恢复战前水平，新区锄二至三遍。
    今年华北已全境解放，战争勤务大为减少，农民可以集中力量从事生产；加之老解放区一般地已结束了土改，农民生产情绪高涨；百分之五十的农村妇女也动员起来参加了农业生产，因之，今年完成老区恢复战前锄苗水平，是有充分条件和物质基础的。我们要有坚强的信心使其完成。
    根据目前各地情况，对于今年的锄苗，我们提出下面几点意见：
    一、必须做到及时：农谚有：“不怕迟种，只怕晚锄”；“黍锄两耳谷锄针，玉茭锄在将出垄”；“苗锄寸，顶上粪”，目前正是锄苗的时期，各地要很好掌握当地锄苗季节，及时领导进行。
    二、要善于组织力量：锄苗工作宜于互助，因有的苗只宜于早晚锄，有的苗午间亦可锄，有的地刚刚雨后不宜锄，这样就可以互相调剂变工，但互助组不宜过大过集中，因锄苗系突击工作，过于集中则可能在时间上往往顾此失彼。又锄苗可以广泛动员妇孺辅助劳力参加，但必须注意精锄，只求快不求精，对于作物则是不惟无益而又害之。
    三、尽可能地推广耘锄：由于锄苗不能使用畜力，造成锄苗季节的人力不足，畜力休闲，当易误时荒地，如能改良农具，使用起畜力来，则锄苗不但可以恢复，且能超过战前水平。在冀中、冀南的津浦路沿线，已普遍使用一种耘锄，一天一人一畜可锄地十五亩，如一人拉牲口一人扶犁则可锄二十亩，较之人锄，提高效率五倍，大为节省了劳力，故而这些地方的锄苗水平，近年并未降低。这种农具，在华北还远未普及，各地应尽力推广，以提高锄苗效率。但此系改进农具之法，且只宜于平原，山地仍宜另求改进办法。
