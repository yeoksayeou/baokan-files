(Jinan Telegram) "Eating coarse grains and vegetables, long-term plan, saving food and clothing to prevent drought and prepare for famine." Some villages in Weixian, Shenxian and other counties in Jinnan have launched a campaign to save and prepare for famine. The Third Working Group of the Ninth District of Weixian County convened a joint meeting of village branch secretaries from seven villages on the 12th to arrange for drought resistance and saving work. They mobilized the people by using the experience of surviving the famine in 1943 and specific accounting methods. They started with party members and cadres, formulated family saving plans, and widely publicized them to the masses, creating a mass saving movement. Zhao Ruitang, director of the Farmers' Association in Huangtai Village, Second District, and farmers Guo Zhongwu, Ma Yinsheng, and others changed their three meals a day to two meals a day. Ma Yinsheng said, "It's dry and it's not raining. When I think about the starvation in 1943, I save a meal now to have an extra day to eat in a famine year." Under their influence, many households have mixed bran, elm leaves, locust leaves, and alfalfa leaves to make vegetable cornbread and vegetable rice. In addition to actively saving, the village also vigorously engaged in production. Under the leadership of village cadres, seven mutual aid groups voluntarily combined to transport goods outside. The Ge Village branch in the Third District of Qinghe County convened a meeting of all party members on May 12 to discuss famine preparation. After the meeting, they went into thorough publicity, calling on the masses to save two ounces of rice per person per day, add more bran and vegetables, and accurately calculate the family's income and expenses. The masses in the whole village began to formulate saving plans, collect tree leaves and wild vegetables, and actively prepare for famine.

　　吃糠掺菜长期打算威县等地防旱备荒
    【冀南电】“吃糠掺菜长期打算，节衣缩食防旱备荒”冀南威、莘等县有些村庄展开节约备荒。威县九区第三工作组，十二日召开七村支书联席会，布置抗旱节约工作。以三十二年渡荒的经验和具体算帐办法进行动员。先从党员、干部做起、订出家庭节约计划，并向群众普遍宣传，造成群众性的节约运动。二区黄台村农会主任赵瑞堂及农民郭中五、马寅升等户，每天三顿饭改为两顿饭，马寅升说：“天旱不下雨，想起来三十二年挨饿的情况，现在省下一顿，荒年吃一天。”在他们的影响下，有许多户都掺了糠、榆叶、槐叶、苜蓿叶，做菜窝窝菜饭。该村除积极节约外，又大力生产，在村干部带领下，自愿结合了七个互助组出外运输。清河三区葛村支部，于五月十二日召开全体党员会，讨论备荒工作。会后深入宣传，号召群众每天每人节省二两米，多掺糠菜，并精确计算全家的收入与开支，全村群众开始订节约计划，采树叶、野菜，积极备荒。
