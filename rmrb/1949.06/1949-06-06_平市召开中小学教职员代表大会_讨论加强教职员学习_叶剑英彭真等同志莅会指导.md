[This Municipality News] The Beiping Municipal Primary and Secondary School Teachers and Staff Representatives Meeting was held on the 4th and 5th at the Beiping Normal University Auditorium. 269 representatives attended, mainly to discuss how to strengthen the learning of primary and secondary school educators, improve the educators themselves, and formulate a plan for the summer teachers and staff learning session. Prior to this meeting, the Preparatory Committee of the Education Association received a total of 310 proposals from members of various schools, more than half of which were related to summer learning, totaling 157. The Preparatory Committee of the Education Association concentrated these opinions and requests and decided to jointly organize a summer teachers and staff learning session with the Municipal Education Bureau.

At this meeting, Mayor Ye Jianying, Secretary of the Municipal Party Committee Peng Zhen, Minister Chao Zhefu of the Ministry of Education of the North China Government, Director Liu of the Municipal Education Bureau, Mr. Ye Shengtao, Comrade Xu Liqun of the Youth Committee, and Comrade Ding Haochuan of North China University all attended and spoke. The Ping City Women's Federation, Youth Federation, and Student Federation also sent representatives to present flags and speeches.

After explaining the international and domestic situation, Mayor Ye put forward three points to everyone: (1) To give the new generation a scientific education, not a superstitious and anesthetizing one. (2) To educate the new generation with new morals. The standard of this morality is in line with the long-term interests of the vast majority of the people. (3) In the People's Liberation War, the peasants contributed the most and should be given the first credit. Educators should help rural areas improve peasant culture. Comrade Peng Zhen spoke on three issues: (1) Historical development has its own path and cannot be stopped. The requirements of historical development are always expressed by the requirements of the vast majority of the people. Educators should serve the needs of historical development, social development, and the needs of the masses of the people. According to this standard, the education during the Kuomintang rule, which belonged to the political part, served imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism, and must be fundamentally transformed. The part that belongs to the knowledge of the struggle for production should also be transformed, but not fundamentally. In the past, students did not clearly know that the purpose of natural science was for production, and theory was divorced from practice. These must be transformed in the future. (2) Engaging in education, if purely for the sake of making a living, one will inevitably fall into distress. Conversely, if one recognizes that educating the new generation is a great undertaking, the work will be very pleasant. The improvement of teachers' lives depends on the restoration and development of production. (3) Educators should teach the most advanced knowledge, so they should constantly learn. Without learning, they cannot teach. Old experiences must be criticized, unsuitable ones removed, suitable ones retained, and new experiences created. In managing students, it is necessary to inspire students' wisdom and let them know why everything is done. Mr. Ye Shengtao used his personal experience to describe the pain of educators under the rule of the Kuomintang. No matter how clean they kept themselves, they could not help but run the education needed by the rulers. Therefore, the clearer the educators' minds, the more painful they felt. But today, the situation where they wanted to teach but could not, and did not want to teach but had to, is completely gone. He hoped that everyone would work hard and run education in a way that is not divorced from society. Minister Chao explained: New Democracy education has been tempered in more than ten years of arduous struggle. The higher culture and science in the cities should be combined with the experience of struggle in the countryside. Director Liu called on everyone to establish new positions, viewpoints, and attitudes in political study in order to correctly understand, analyze, and deal with problems.

　　平市召开中小学教职员代表大会
  　讨论加强教职员学习
    叶剑英彭真等同志莅会指导
    【本市讯】北平市中小学教职员代表会议于四、五两日在北师礼堂举行，出席代表二百六十九人，主要讨论如何加强中小学教育工作者的学习，提高教育工作者自身，订出暑期教职员学习会的计划。此次会前，教联筹委会收到各校会员提案计三百一十件，其中有关暑期学习的在一半以上，共一百五十七件。教联筹委会集中了这些意见与要求，决定与市教育局共同举办暑期教职员学习会。
    此次会议上，叶剑英市长、彭真市委书记，华北政府教育部晁哲甫部长，市教育局柳＠局长，叶圣陶先生，青委许立群同志，华大丁浩川同志均曾莅会讲话，平市妇联、青联、学联也都派代表来献旗献辞。
    叶市长在说明了国际国内形势后，向大家提出三点：（一）要给予新的一代科学的而不是迷信的、麻醉的教育。（二）要用新的道德来教育新的一代。这道德的标准是符合于最大多数人民的长远利益的。（三）人民解放战争中，农民出力最多，应得第一功。教育工作者应帮助农村提高农民文化。彭真同志讲了三个问题：（一）历史发展有其自己的道路，是不可阻止的。历史发展的要求总以最大多数人民的要求表现出来。教育工作者应为历史发展需要为社会发展为人民大众的需要服务。根据这标准来检查国民党统治时代的教育，属于政治的一部分，是为帝国主义、封建主义、官僚资本主义服务的，必须加以根本的改造。属于生产斗争知识的一部分，也要改造，但不是根本性的。过去学生对自然科学，没有明确的知道目的是为了生产，理论与实际脱节，这些今后必须加以改造。（二）从事教育工作，如单纯为了饭腕，自己必然陷于苦恼。反之，如认清教育好新的一代，是一伟大事业，工作就非常愉快。教师生活的改善有待于生产的恢复与发展。（三）教育工作者要把最进步的知识教人，所以应不断的学习，不学就不能教。必须把旧的经验加以批判，除去不适用的，留下适用的，并创造新的经验。在管理学生中，要启发学生智慧，每件事都让学生知道为什么。叶圣陶先生以切身的经验说出了在国民党统治下教育工作者的痛苦，不论如何洁身自好，无法不办统治者所需要的教育。因此教育工作者头脑愈清楚，就愈感到痛苦。但在今天，以前想教的而不能教，不想教的而不得不教的情形完全没有了，他希望大家努力工作，办教育不要和社会脱节。晁部长说明：新民主主义教育是十几年来艰苦斗争中锻炼出来，城市中较高的文化科学应与乡村的斗争经验合起来。柳局长号召大家在政治学习中建立新的立场、观点和态度，以便正确地认识，分析与处理问题。
