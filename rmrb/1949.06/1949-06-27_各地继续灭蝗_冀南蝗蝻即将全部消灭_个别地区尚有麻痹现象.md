　　Locust Control Continues in Various Regions
　　Locust Nymphs in Southern Hebei to be Eliminated Soon
　　Some Areas Still Showing Complacency
　　[Jinan Electric Message] Masses in various areas of Southern Hebei are actively catching locusts, and locust nymphs in the entire region are approaching elimination. Individual areas are not vigilant enough, which urgently needs correction. Locusts have been found in all counties of the Third Administrative Region. Cixian, Weixian, Linzhang, Jize, and Daming counties have basically eliminated them and have transitioned to plowing wasteland and combating drought. In the Fourth Administrative Region, Nington, Longyao, Renxian, and Nanhe have also largely eliminated the locusts. Leaders at all levels attach great importance to locust control. The District Secretary and Head of the Third District of Yongnian, upon hearing that there were locusts in Hanzhuang and other places, immediately rushed there to lead the masses in catching and beating the locusts. At the same time, mobilization of the masses was relatively thorough, making locust control a movement. In the Third Administrative Region alone, 310,000 people participated in locust catching. However, individual areas still show insufficient vigilance. In Xiguan of Qinghe County in the Second Administrative Region, locust nymphs were discovered on the 16th, some of which had already grown wings. The county only instructed to draw three district cadres to mobilize women and children to catch and beat the locusts. This approach will hardly be effective, and the masses should be vigorously mobilized immediately to eliminate them to avoid major harm.
　　[Taihang Electric Message] Since June, locust nymphs have generally occurred in the Fifth Administrative Region. Various counties have launched a locust control and crop protection movement. According to incomplete statistics from counties such as Linxian, Anyang, and Cixian, over 138,000 people participate in locust control every day, and in three days, approximately 40,000 to 50,000 jin of locusts have been eliminated, saving 156,759 mu of seedlings from locust damage. The main locust control tactics are: 1. Concentrated burning in wastelands and hills to kill them. 2. Digging ditches and chasing them from all directions to bury them. 3. In order not to damage the seedlings, chasing the locusts to the main roads and eliminating them in a concentrated manner. 4. Live capture of small locust nymphs.
　　[Taiyue Electric Message] Recently, Jiyuan has experienced locust plagues. The County Committee issued an emergency instruction on the 13th to villages in the affected areas to launch a blitz to eliminate locusts, but this did not receive widespread attention. To this end, the County Committee and County Government convened a joint meeting of branch secretaries and district heads on the 16th to criticize complacency. It was decided to carry out widespread publicity among the masses, with branch secretaries and district heads personally leading, and regulations were established for commendation, reward methods, and reporting systems. The entire county has now become tense and is taking action. The flying locusts in the Third District have been basically eliminated. Over 600 people from seven villages, including Xiuchang, Peicun, and Zhongmatou in the Third District, united to encircle and suppress the locusts on all sides, killing more than 80 jin in one day.
　　[Another Electric Message] Meng County discovered locusts on June 17th. The County Committee is mobilizing farmers to catch and beat them. The county stipulates a reward of two jin of wheat for every jin of locusts caught and four jin of wheat for every jin of locust eggs dug up.
　　[Taihang News] Locust nymphs and cotton aphids (oil sweat bugs) have occurred in Yuanshi, Gaoyi, Shahe, and other places. The entire staff of the Xingtai Agricultural Experiment Station of the Taihang Region, including extension cadres and technical cadres, have organized three pest control teams and gone to Yuanshi, Gaoyi, Shahe, and other places. They are organizing the masses to eliminate pests and have brought insecticides and sprayers, which will be promoted for use after effective testing.

　　[Taihang News] The First Administrative Office of Taihang convened a pest control training class on June 3rd. At the meeting, the Xingtai Agricultural Experiment Station introduced various pest control methods and, in conjunction with the pest control experience of the trainees, clarified several effective pest control methods: such as using tobacco leaf water or tobacco-lime water to control cotton aphids. To control red spiders, someone sweeps the water field with a broom in front, and immediately irrigates behind, and the insects will die quickly. In dry land, someone sweeps with a broom in front, and someone uses a hoe to cover the insects with soil behind. To control mole crickets, use horse manure to lure and kill them, or bury small earthenware pots in the ground to lure and kill them. After the trained trainees returned to their counties, they immediately selected key points and conducted pest control training in the form of seminars to implement pest control techniques among the masses.

　　各地继续灭蝗
  　冀南蝗蝻即将全部消灭
  　个别地区尚有麻痹现象
    【冀南电】冀南各地群众积极捕蝗，全区蝗蝻接近捕灭。个别地区警惕不够，急待纠正。三专区各县均发现蝗虫，现成磁、魏县、临漳、鸡泽、大名五县已基本上消灭，转入翻土开荒及抗旱工作。四专区宁南、隆尧、任县、南和也已大部残灭。各级领导对灭蝗极为重视，永年三区区书区长听说韩庄等地有蝗虫，即连夜赶去领导群众捕打。同时对群众动员也较深入，使捕蝗形成运动。三专区参加捕蝗群众即达三十一万人。但个别地区仍有警惕不够现象，二专区清河西关于十六日发现蝗蝻，有的已长翅。县里仅指示抽三个区干发动妇女儿童捕打。这样势难收效，应即大力发动群众，立即捕灭，免成大害。
    【太行电】六月以来，五专区普遍发生蝗蝻。各县已展开灭蝗保苗运动，据林县、安阳、磁县等县不完全统计：每天参加的剿蝗群众即达十三万八千余人，三天中约计灭蝗四、五万斤，使十五万六千七百五十九亩青苗灭去蝗害。灭蝗战术主要有：一、在荒地山岗上集中点火烧死。二、挖土沟，从各处四面追赶而后埋死。三、为了不损坏青苗，把蝗追赶到大路上集中消灭。四、小蝗蝻进行活捉。
    【太岳电】济源最近发生蝗害，县委会在十三日紧急指示发生蝗害区村，突击灭蝗，但未普遍引起注意。为此县委会、县政府在十六日，又召开了分书、区长联席会议批判麻痹思想。决定普遍地在群众中进行宣传，分书、区长要亲自领导，规定了表扬、奖励办法和报告制度。现在全县已紧张行动起来。三区飞蝗基本已消灭。三区休昌、裴村、中马头等七村，六百多人联合起来，四面围剿，一天打死八十多斤。
    【又电】孟县在六月十七日，发现蝗虫。县委会正在发动农民捕打。该县规定打一斤，奖麦二斤，挖蝗卵一斤，奖麦四斤。
    【太行讯】元氏、高邑、沙河等地发生蝗蝻、棉蚜虫（油汗虫）。太行区邢台农业试验场，全体推广干部和技术干部组织了三个除虫队，分赴元氏、高邑、沙河等地。组织群众扑灭虫害，并携带了杀虫药品及喷雾器，试验有效后即推广使用。

    【太行讯】太行第一专署于六月三日召开除虫训练班，会上由邢台农业试验场介绍各地治虫办法，并结合学员的除虫经验，明确了几个治虫有效办法：如治棉蚜虫用烟叶水或烟草石灰水。治红蜘蛛，水地前面用扫帚打，后面马上浇水，虫就很快死去，旱地则前面有人用扫帚打，后面用锄板把虫子锄盖土中。治蝼蛄用马粪诱杀，或把小瓦罐埋在地里诱杀。受训学员回县以后，即马上选择基点，以座谈方式，进行除虫训练，使除虫技术，贯彻到群众中去。　　　（艺农）
