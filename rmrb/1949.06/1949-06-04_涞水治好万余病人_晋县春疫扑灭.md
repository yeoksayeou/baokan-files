Laishui Cures Over 10,000 Patients
Jin County Eradicates Spring Epidemic

[Chahar News] This spring, Laishui experienced various illnesses, including influenza, smallpox, gastrointestinal disorders, etc. From January to the end of April, statistics show that there were 13,826 patients in the county (the county has a total population of 71,865). Doctors were organized to go to the villages to treat 12,190 patients, while 1,541 were still being treated, and 95 died. In order to prevent and treat diseases, the county convened a meeting of doctors on February 19 to study the disease situation and exchange experiences, and then launched a campaign to provide medical treatment in the villages. For example, in Zhuangli Village, Fourth District, more than 100 people were infected with influenza in nine days. In addition to organizing five local doctors to provide emergency treatment, a doctor from the First District was also transferred to help with the treatment, and the epidemic was quickly brought under control.

[Central Hebei Electric] Since the beginning of spring, Jin County has seen the prevalence of infectious diseases such as measles, spring pestilence, and influenza. The County Medical Association organized 69 doctors from the county for emergency treatment, and the epidemic has now been eradicated. After arriving in the villages, the doctors, in conjunction with county and district cadres leading production, convened village cadre meetings to widely carry out propaganda on epidemic prevention and anti-superstition campaigns. They paid attention to isolating those who were already sick and villages with severe disease outbreaks. For villages with mild disease outbreaks, they conducted general check-ups on children and provided health education to parents. Sanitary campaigns were carried out in general villages. In addition to using medicines for treatment, they also developed a method of extracting two cc of blood from the child's father or mother and injecting it into the child, which can alleviate severe cases and prevent mild cases from developing. Nearly 2,000 people have been cured, which has been supported by the local people. The folks in Houchang said, "If it weren't for the People's Government leading the doctors to save our lives, who knows how many people would have died!"

　　涞水治好万余病人
  　晋县春疫扑灭
    【察哈尔讯】涞水今春发生了多种病患，有流行感冒、痘疹、肠胃箔…等。从一月至四月底统计，全县共有病人一万三千八百二十六名（全县共有七万一千八百六十五口人），组织医生下乡治愈者一万二千一百九十名，未愈正治者一千五百四十一名，死亡者九十五名。为防疫治病该县二月十九日即召开了全县医生座谈会，研究了患病的情况，交流了经验，随即下乡突击医治。如四区庄里村九天功夫流行感冒已到百余名，除组织当地五个医生突击治疗外，又调一区一个医生帮助治疗，不几天就扑灭了。　　　　　（董春兴）
    【冀中电】晋县入春以来，发现麻疹春瘟流行性感冒等传染病，经该县医联会组织全县六十九名医生急救，现已扑灭。医生到村后，结合领导生产的县区干部，召开村干会议，广泛开展宣传防疫运动和反迷信宣传。对已病的人，和病灾严重的村庄注意隔离，对病灾轻的村把孩子普遍进行了检查，并向家长进行卫生教育。一般村开展卫生运动。除利用药品治疗外，还研究出以孩子的父或母的血抽出两西西，注射在孩子身上，病重的能减轻，病轻的不再发展。现已治好近两千人，受到当地群众的拥护。候城的老乡说：“要不是人民政府领导医生来救命，说不清得死多少人哩！”
