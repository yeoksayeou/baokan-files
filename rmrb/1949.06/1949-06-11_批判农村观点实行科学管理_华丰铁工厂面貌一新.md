　　Critique of Rural Perspectives, Implementation of Scientific Management
  　Hua Feng Iron Factory Takes on a New Look
    [Reported by this newspaper] The Hua Feng Iron Factory in Changzhi City, Taihang, has critiqued rural perspectives in its management methods, implemented democratic management, strengthened economic accounting, and calculated costs, gradually moving the factory management towards enterprise management. This factory was built and developed from the mountains during the Anti-Japanese War in 1945. The majority of the workers came from rural areas, and the cadres were in a rural environment for a long time. Therefore, their business management was tinged with rural perspectives. After the announcement of the North China Industry and Commerce Conference and the Sixth National Labor Congress resolutions last year, the factory launched a study and review, first criticizing the past erroneous view that factory management did not rely on the working class, but on poor and lower-middle peasants. For example, in developing party members, they only paid attention to absorbing workers from poor and lower-middle peasant backgrounds, without absorbing veteran industrial workers. The workers' movement also relied on poor and lower-middle peasants. For some veteran industrial workers from newly liberated areas who had technical skills, they considered them politically "backward," only utilizing their skills and not strengthening education and relying on them. Some apprentices, because they were from poor and lower-middle peasant backgrounds, became arrogant and disrespectful to their masters, making the relationship between masters and apprentices very bad. In wage policy, the standard was not based on the level of skill, work attitude, and contribution to production, but excessively attached political conditions, the so-called "70% politics, 30% technology." As a result, the wages of some skilled workers with great achievements who were considered politically "backward" were rated very low, while those who were not very skilled, had ordinary achievements, but were considered politically "good" were rated high. Thus, skilled workers believed that having skills was useless, and those without skills believed that learning and improving skills was also useless, which greatly limited the learning and development of skills.
    In business management, they criticized the past neglect of scientific management and precise calculation, and the one-sided emphasis on mobilizing the masses and relying on enthusiasm, resulting in an anarchic and undisciplined extreme democratic phenomenon. At the same time, they also criticized the past mobilization of production competitions not fully promoting democracy and improving the class consciousness of workers, but simply relying on economic incentives.
    The above issues were systematically reviewed and criticized ideologically through the open party branch last December. Starting in January of this year, gradual reforms and corrections were made in various tasks. First, the egalitarian wage policy was corrected, a movement of respecting teachers and cherishing apprentices was launched, and the unity between masters and apprentices was strengthened. In terms of developing party members, fifteen outstanding industrial workers have joined the party organization. Veteran industrial workers with leadership skills who are supported by the masses have also been promoted to leadership positions in the workers' union, greatly strengthening the unity of the working class. In business management, a democratic management committee was organized to strengthen economic accounting, improve the audit and budget system, and achieve unified and planned use of funds, so that the entire production process and capital flow process are organized and planned. In terms of production, in addition to enlightening the class consciousness of workers to make them consciously produce, there must be careful production plans, strict labor organization, and reasonable equipment allocation. Thanks to these improvements, the entire staff is unprecedentedly united, and production morale has been greatly improved. Some veteran craftsmen only regret that they cannot immediately teach their skills to their apprentices, and the apprentices are also desperately learning skills. The veteran craftsman Pan Liangkai voluntarily gathered twenty apprentices to learn skills after work. It is expected that the fifty machines stipulated in this year's spring production plan will be completed twenty days ahead of schedule.

### 批判农村观点实行科学管理　华丰铁工厂面貌一新

　　批判农村观点实行科学管理
  　华丰铁工厂面貌一新
    【本报讯】太行长治市华丰铁工厂，批判农村观点的经营方法，实行民主管理加强经济核算，计算成本，使工厂管理逐渐走向企业化。该厂是在一九四五年抗日期间从山沟里建设和发展起来的，工人大部来自农村，干部长期处在农村环境，因此在经营管理上，就带有农村观点。去年华北工商业会议和全国第六次劳大决议公布之后，该厂展开学习检查，首先批判了以往管理工厂不是依靠工人阶级，而是依靠贫雇的错误观点，如发展党员只注意吸收贫雇农出身的工人，而不吸收老产业工人，职工运动也是依靠贫雇，对于一些从新解放区来的、有技术的老产业工人，认为他们政治上“落后”，只是利用他们的技术，而不是加强教育依靠他们。有些徒弟因为是贫雇出身，便自高自大，不尊重师傅，使师徒关系十分恶劣。在工资政策上不是以技术高低、劳动态度和对生产的贡献为标准，而过多的附加政治条件，所谓“七分政治三分技术”，因此把一些技术高成绩大而认为政治“落后”的工人工资评的很低，有些技术不高，成绩平常，而认为政治上“好”的评的就高，工匠和学徒工资差额很少。于是有技术的工人认为有技术没啥用，没有技术的认为学习提高技术也没啥用。因而大大地限制了技术的学习和发展。
    在经营管理上，他们批判了以往忽视科学管理和精确计算，而单纯偏重于发动群众，靠热情办事，因而形成无组织无纪律、无领导的极端民主现象，同时也批判了以往发动生产竞赛不是充分发扬民主和提高工人的阶级觉悟，而是单纯的经济刺激。
    以上问题经过去年十二月公开党的支部，从思想上作了有系统的检查和批判。今年一月起在各种工作上又作了有步骤的改革和纠正，首先纠正了平均主义的工资政策，开展了敬师爱徒运动，加强了师徒团结。在发展党员方面已经有十五个优秀的产业工人参加了党的组织，在职工运动中有领导能力受群众拥护的老产业工人也被提拔到职工会的领导岗位上来，大大加强了工人阶级的团结。在经营管理上，组织了民主管理委员会加强了经济核算，健全了审会计预决算制度，做到资金统一而有计划的运用，使整个生产过程和资金流通过程，都作到有组织有计划。在生产方面，除了启发工人阶级觉悟使其自觉生产以外，须有周密的生产计划，严密的劳力组织，合理的器材配备。由于这些改进，使全体职工空前团结，生产情绪大大提高。一些老工匠只恨自己不能把技术一下拿出来教给徒弟，而徒弟也在拼命的学习技术，老工匠潘良凯自动集合了二十来个徒弟在下工以后学习技术。今年春季生产计划中所规定完成的五十部机器，预计将提前二十天完成。
