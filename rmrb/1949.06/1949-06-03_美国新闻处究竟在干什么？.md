　　What Exactly is the United States Information Service Doing?
    Fuying

    The United States Information Service (USIS), with branches all over the world, is engaged in propaganda, promoting the anti-Soviet, anti-communist, and anti-people policies of American imperialism. This is obvious to everyone, but it is only the surface.

    In her book "The Truth About American Diplomats," Mrs. Budenz has a chapter (Chapter 5) that talks about the real activities of the USIS. She is an American who was sent to work at the USIS in Moscow for two and a half years, so her words are certainly reliable. She says: "Although the USIS is formally a propaganda organ, it actually undertakes intelligence work." "The USIS uses its branches and news representatives in allied and neutral countries to carry out its intelligence and propaganda work."

    It is by no means accidental that the leading figures in the USIS are mostly trained in intelligence work. She says: "Since the USIS was established in Moscow during the war, the people in leading positions have clearly had close ties with intelligence work, or at least have been trained in intelligence work."

    Those who are unwilling to do intelligence work cannot stand their ground in the USIS. She tells in great detail about the Willis case. Willis was sent to the USIS in Moscow in 1946 as director. Although he had studied at the Naval Intelligence School, he was a little too naive and mistakenly thought that his mission was really to promote cultural relations between the American and Soviet peoples, as the State Department said in its high-sounding words. Of course, he was not tolerated by the American Embassy in the Soviet Union. The First Secretary of the Embassy, John Davies (who had been an advisor to General Stilwell's headquarters in China and had been to Yan'an), was responsible for finding fault with Willis in order to get rid of him. Davies tried to gather materials to prove that he was first, a lazy worker, second, sympathetic to the Communists or was a Communist, and third, had casual sexual relations with female employees of the embassy. However, it was difficult to find this evidence. Finally, Davies finally got hold of Willis's weakness, which was his report on his trip to Kiev, and used his report as a reason for being pro-Soviet to drive him away.

    "The USIS of the American Embassy, since it began working in Moscow, has provided cover for many genuine intelligence officers: in the past, such as Colonel Phillips, Ms. Egan, Willis, and more recently, Locks, Hansen, etc. Locks and Hansen used to work for the 'Strategic Services Bureau,' and their work in the USIS was only a cover for their intelligence work."

### 美国新闻处究竟在干什么？

　　美国新闻处究竟在干什么？
    福英
    遍设世界各地的美国新闻处是在从事宣传工作，在宣传美国帝国主义的反苏、反共、反人民的政策。这是众目共见的，但这也只是表面的。
    布加女士在“美国外交家真相”一书中，有一章（第五章）讲到美国新闻处的真正活动。她是美国人，曾经被派往莫斯科的美国新闻处工作，工作了二年半，她的话当然是可靠的。她说：“虽然美国新闻处在形式上是一个宣传机关，实际是担负情报工作。”“美国新闻处利用其设在联盟国与中立国内的分处及其新闻代表，进行其情报和宣传工作。”
    美国新闻处的指导人物，大都受过情报工作训练，这也决不是偶然的。她说：“自从美国新闻处在战时设立于莫斯科以来，居于领导地位的人物，都显然是与情报工作有密切连系，最少是受过情报工作训练的。”
    不愿作情报的人，在美国新闻处是站不住脚的。她很详细地讲述威里斯案件。威里斯在一九四六年被派往莫斯科美国新闻处担任处长，虽然他在海军情报学校读过书，但他有点过于天真，误以为他的任务真是象国务院的冠冕堂皇的话所说那样，是促进美苏两民族间的文化关系，结果当然是不见容于驻苏的美国大使馆。大使馆的一等秘书约翰·台维斯（此人曾在中国担任过史特威总部的顾问，到过延安）、负责找威里斯的岔以便撵走他。台维斯企图搜集材料来证明他第一是懒惰的工作人员，第二是同情共产党或就是共产党人，第三是与大使馆女职员随便发生性关系。可是，很难找到这些证据。最后，台维斯终于拿到了威里斯的把柄，就是他的基夫旅行的报告，以他的报告是亲苏的为理由，把他赶走。
    “美国大使馆的美国新闻处，自从在莫斯科开始工作以来，给许多正牌情报官以掩护：过去如菲立浦上校、伊根女士、威里斯，最近如洛克斯、韩森等。洛克斯与韩森以前在‘战略服务局’工作过，他们在美国新闻处的工作，只是他们的情报工作之掩护。”
