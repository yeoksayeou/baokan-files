　　Battle of the Grammos Mountains

　　The Grammos Mountains in northwestern Greece used to be an important base for the Greek Democratic Army to resist the Nazis. In June 1948, the Greek Royalist fascist government, with 100,000 troops (more than one-third of its total army) equipped with American aircraft, artillery, tanks, and flamethrowers, and under the personal command of American generals, began an offensive against the Grammos Mountains, attempting to annihilate the Democratic Army in one fell swoop. However, after seventy days of heroic fighting, the Democratic Army annihilated more than 25,000 enemy troops and successfully transferred its main force to the Vitsi area, placing the Royalist fascist forces in Vitsi and Murga Bond in unprecedented difficulties. Since the beginning of this year, under the call of "striving to make this year the year of decisive victory," the Democratic Army has continued to launch offensives against the Grammos Mountains, resulting in the complete liberation it has now achieved. This will connect the liberated areas of the Democratic Army in the extreme north, northeast, and northwest of Greece, and allow it to launch attacks into the central region at any time, which will be greatly beneficial to the future war situation.

　　格拉姆斯山区战斗
    希腊西北部格拉姆斯山区，原来是希腊民主军抵抗纳粹的重要根据地之一。一九四八年六月希腊保皇法西斯政府以十万（占其全部军队的三分之一以上）配备了美国飞机、大炮、坦克和火焰放射器的军队，在美国将军的亲自指挥下，开始向格拉姆斯山进攻，妄图一举歼灭民主军。但是民主军七十天的英勇奋战，歼敌二万五千余人，胜利地使自己的主力转移到维齐一带，使维齐及姆尔加邦的保皇法西斯军陷于从未有过的困难地位。今年开始以来，民主军在“争取今年为决定胜利的一年”的号召下，继续不断的向格拉姆斯山区进攻的结果乃获得现在的全部解放。这就会使民主军在希腊极北、东北和西北部的解放区联在一起，并可以随时向中部出击，对今后作战形势将大为有利。
