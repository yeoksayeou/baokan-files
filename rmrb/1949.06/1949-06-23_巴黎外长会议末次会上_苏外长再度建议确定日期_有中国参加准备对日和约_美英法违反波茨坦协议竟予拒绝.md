Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, June 22nd: Reports from various sources: The Foreign Ministers Conference of the Soviet Union, the United States, Britain, and France, which opened in Paris on May 23rd, closed on June 20th. At the final meeting, Soviet Foreign Minister Vyshinsky reiterated that the Foreign Ministers Conference must agree on a date to prepare a peace treaty with Japan with China's participation, but the US, British, and French Foreign Ministers unreasonably refused.

On June 20th, the four Foreign Ministers first held a closed-door meeting, followed by a plenary session chaired by British Foreign Secretary Bevin. The meeting approved the minutes of the Paris Foreign Ministers Conference.

During the discussion of the approval of the minutes, Vyshinsky stated that on May 23rd, the Soviet delegation had raised the question of whether it was possible to agree on a date for convening a Foreign Ministers Conference with China's participation to discuss the issue of a peace treaty with Japan. Vyshinsky said that at that time, not all Foreign Ministers had spoken on this issue. For example, Bevin had stated that he needed to consult with the British government. U.S. Secretary of State Acheson also stated that it was necessary to draw on experience in considering similar issues and that consideration of the issue raised by the Soviet delegation depended on the successful resolution of the issues listed on the agenda of this session. Vyshinsky pointed out that although this session of the Foreign Ministers Conference had failed to reach an agreement on the major issue of restoring Germany's economic and political unity and on the issue of a peace treaty with Germany, some issues had been resolved, which created the conditions mentioned by Acheson. Thus, it is now possible to provide an answer to the question raised by the Soviet Union. Vyshinsky emphasized that his intention was only to determine the date of the Foreign Ministers Conference to discuss the issue of a peace treaty with Japan.

Bevin replied to Vyshinsky's question, saying that the British government could not now give "any date on which a Foreign Ministers Conference to discuss the issue of a peace treaty with Japan could be convened." Acheson went on to say that the U.S. government did not consider the Foreign Ministers Conference to be "an appropriate body for preparing a peace treaty with Japan." Acheson asserted, disregarding the facts, that "the Potsdam Agreement did not include using the Foreign Ministers Conference for this purpose." He said that the U.S. government still believed that the preparation of a peace treaty with Japan must be the responsibility of a conference composed of the member states of the Far Eastern Commission. French Foreign Minister Schuman said that France had agreed with this U.S. view even two years ago, and its position remains unchanged.

Vyshinsky stated in his second speech that he had only raised the issue of a date, but Acheson had expanded this issue, touching on the fundamental question of whether the Foreign Ministers Conference was an "appropriate body" for discussing the issue of a peace treaty with Japan. Vyshinsky said that the Potsdam Agreement explicitly stipulated: "The Meeting has agreed that there should be established a Council of Foreign Ministers representing the five principal powers to continue the necessary preparatory work for the peace settlements and to take up other matters which from time to time may be referred to the Council by agreement of the Governments participating in the Council." Vyshinsky emphasized that there were no restrictions here, it did not say that peacemaking only concerned Germany and Italy, and not Japan. This is perfectly understandable. Vyshinsky also mentioned another point in the Potsdam Agreement, which stipulated: "For the purposes of this Agreement the Council shall include the States which are the signatories to the terms of surrender imposed upon the enemy state concerned." Vyshinsky said that the surrender conditions were imposed on Japan, so which countries imposed these conditions on Japan? Among them was China. Therefore, according to this clause, China has every right to participate in the Foreign Ministers Conference in preparing the peace treaty with Japan.

Although Vyshinsky thoroughly demonstrated that the Foreign Ministers Conference was the only legitimate body responsible for preparing the peace treaty with Japan, Acheson still denied this obvious fact. He said: "The Potsdam Agreement did not talk about a peace treaty with Japan at all." He also said: "At the time of signing the Potsdam Agreement, the Soviet Union was not even at war with Japan." Acheson also said that as early as 1947, a U.S. government spokesperson advocated that the Far Eastern Commission, rather than the Foreign Ministers Conference, should prepare the peace treaty with Japan, "If the Soviet Union had accepted this suggestion at that time, we would have made considerable progress in preparing the peace treaty with Japan."

Vyshinsky answered Acheson by listing facts to prove that the arguments put forward by the U.S. representative could not stand up to scrutiny. Vyshinsky mentioned the role played by the Soviet Union on the Far Eastern front, pointing out that this role was well known, and any attempt to belittle this role was doomed to failure. Vyshinsky also said that, in any case, the question of whether China must participate in the work of the Foreign Ministers Conference in preparing the peace treaty with Japan cannot be denied. China was already at war with Japan when the Potsdam Agreement was drafted. Regarding Acheson's statement that if the Soviet Union had not refused to accept the U.S. suggestion of preparing the peace treaty with Japan in the Far Eastern Commission, then the preparation work would have progressed, Vyshinsky said that it was the United States, not the Soviet Union, that delayed the preparation of the peace treaty with Japan, because the United States was unwilling to follow the procedure adopted by the Potsdam Conference.

The Western representatives did not refute the arguments put forward by the Soviet Foreign Minister, but they stubbornly adhered to their position. Therefore, no decision was passed regarding the Foreign Ministers Conference having to agree on a date to prepare a peace treaty with Japan with China's participation.

### 巴黎外长会议末次会上  苏外长再度建议确定日期  有中国参加准备对日和约  美英法违反波茨坦协议竟予拒绝

    巴黎外长会议末次会上
    苏外长再度建议确定日期
    有中国参加准备对日和约
    美英法违反波茨坦协议竟予拒绝
    【新华社北平二十二日电】各方报道：五月二十三日在巴黎开幕的苏美英法外长会议，已于六月二十日闭幕。在最后一次会议上，苏外长维辛斯基再度提出外长会议必须协议一个日期在中国参加之下准备对日和约的问题，但经美英法外长无理拒绝。
    六月二十日，四国外长首先举行秘密会议，其后举行全体会议，由英外相贝文任主席。会议通过了巴黎外长会议的会议记录。
    在讨论会议记录的批准时，维辛斯基发言称，五月二十三日，苏联代表团曾提出是否有可能协议一个日子，召开有中国参加的外长会议，以讨论对日和约的问题。维辛斯基说，当时，并不是所有的外长都对这一问题发过言。举例说，贝文曾称，他需要与英国政府咨商。美国务卿艾奇逊亦称有必要吸取考虑同类问题之经验，并称对苏联代表团所提出之问题的考虑，有赖于本届会议议程上所列问题之胜利解决。维辛斯基就此指出，本届外长会议虽然对恢复德国经济和政治统一这一主要问题以及对德和约问题，未能达到协议，但是有一些问题已经解决，这就创造了艾奇逊所说的条件。这样，现在对苏联所提之问题作一答复是可能的。维辛斯基又着重地说，他的意思只是确定召开讨论对日和约问题的外长会议的日期。
    贝文答复维辛斯基所提的问题说，英政府现在不能举出“可以召开讨论对日和约问题的外长会议的任何日期”。艾奇逊接着说，美国政府并不认为外长会议是“准备对日和约的适当机构”。艾奇逊不顾事实地断言，“波茨坦协定决没有包括将外长会议用于这一目的的内容”。他说：美国政府仍然认为，对日和约的准备工作，必须由远东委员会诸会员国组成的会议负责。法外长舒曼说，法国甚至在两年以前就同意美国的这一意见，现在的立场仍未改变。
    维辛斯基在再次发言时声称，他提出的只是日期问题，但是，艾奇逊却把这一问题扩大了，他触及到外长会议是否是讨论对日和约问题的“适当机构”这个原则问题。维辛斯基说，波茨坦协议曾明确地规定：“会议获得协议，应建立代表五大国的外长会议，以继续缔造和平的必要准备工作，并负责处理参与外长会议各政府同意而可能随时提交外长会议之其他事宜。”维辛斯基强调称，这里没有任何限制，这里没有说，缔造和平只关系德国和意大利，而不关系日本。这是完全可以了解的。维辛斯基又提到波茨坦协定中的另一点，该点规定：“为执行上述每一任务（按即缔造和平的任务），外长会议将包括在强加于该项任务所关的敌国的投降条款上签字的国家。”维辛斯基说，投降条件是强加于日本的，那些国家把这些条件强加于日本呢？其中就有中国。因此，根据这一节，在准备对日缔和中间，中国完全有权参加外长会议。
    虽然维辛斯基透澈地证明了外长会议是负责准备对日和约的唯一合法机构，但是，艾奇逊仍然否认这一明显的事实。他说：“波茨坦协定根本没有谈到对日和约的事。”他又说：“在签订波茨坦协定的时候，苏联甚至未曾与日本处于作战状态。”艾奇逊又说，早在一九四七年，美国政府发言人就主张由远东委员会而不是由外长会议准备对日和约，“如果当时苏联接受这一建议，则我们在准备对日和约上，就会已经有颇大的进展了”。
    维辛斯基回答艾奇逊时列举事实证明：美国代表所提出的论据完全经不起一驳。维辛斯基提及苏联在远东战线上所起的作用，指出这一作用尽人皆知，一切想贬低这一作用的企图，都注定要失败。维辛斯基又说，无论怎样，在准备对日和约中，中国是否必须参加外长会议工作的问题，是无法否认的。中国在波茨坦协定拟定的时候，已在对日作战。关于艾奇逊所说，若不是苏联拒绝接受美国在远东委员会中准备对日和约的建议则准备工作必已有进展一节，维辛斯基说，拖延准备对日和约的是美国而不是苏联，因为美国不愿遵照波茨坦会议通过的程序。
    西方代表们没有反驳苏联外长所提出的论点，但是，他们固执自己的立场。因此，关于外长会议必须协议一个日期在中国参加之下准备对日和约一事，没有通过决定。
