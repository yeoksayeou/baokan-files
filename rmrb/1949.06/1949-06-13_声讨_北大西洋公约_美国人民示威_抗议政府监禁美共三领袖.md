　　Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 12th: A movement against the North Atlantic Treaty is expanding within the United States. Progressive people in the United States are also expressing unanimous anger at the U.S. government's imprisonment of three leaders of the American Communist Party. On the 8th, approximately 3,000 representatives from 45 labor unions and other people's organizations in New York traveled to Washington to denounce the North Atlantic Treaty, protest the anti-communist movement, and demand that the Truman government fulfill its campaign promises, unconditionally abolish the Taft-Hartley Act, enact a bill of rights, and provide adequate housing and sanitation facilities. A procession of more than 2,000 people marched past the White House, with demonstrators holding signs that read: "Peaceful negotiations, not war pacts." Representatives also visited Assistant Attorney General Campbell to protest Judge Medina's decision to imprison American Communist leaders Gates, Winston, and Hall.
