    Wheat Harvest in Shijiazhuang Suburbs
    Over 4.6 Million Jin More Than Last Year
    [Shijiazhuang Electricity] Shijiazhuang's suburban wheat fields have yielded a bumper harvest, an increase of 18,480 shi compared to last year. With each shi calculated at 250 jin, this amounts to over 4.61 million jin. The total arable land in the four suburban districts is 140,000 mu. In the autumn of 1947, 59,748 mu were planted with wheat, and in the autumn of last year, 69,301 mu were planted, an increase of 9,550 mu. This year, the average yield per mu is 8.375 dou, an increase of 1.625 dou compared to last year's average of 6.75 dou per mu. The total increase is 18,480 shi. The main reasons for the increase are the end of land reform, the issuance of land certificates, the increased enthusiasm of farmers for production, and the government's various agricultural loans, which solved the difficulties of farmers in terms of seeds, livestock, fertilizer, and cultivation. At the same time, most of the suburbs are irrigated land. There was little snow last winter and a lack of rain this spring. The government vigorously helped farmers purchase 324 head of draught animals and 210 waterwheels, and loaned out more than 20,000 bricks to help farmers repair wells, overcoming the drought. This is the first bumper wheat harvest after the land reform, and all the liberated farmers in the suburbs are enthusiastically celebrating.

    石市郊区小麦丰收
    较去年增产四百余万斤
    【石家庄电】石家庄郊区麦田丰收，较去年增产一万八千四百八十石，每石以二百五十斤计，合四百六十一万余斤。四郊可耕土地总计十四万亩，一九四七年秋种麦五万九千七百四十八亩，去年秋天种麦六万九千三百零一亩，共增加九千五百五十亩，今年每亩平均产八点三七五斗，较去年每亩平均六点七五斗增产一点六二五斗。总计增产一万八千四百八十石。增产的主要原因，是由于结束土地改革，发给土地证，农民生产情绪的提高，以及政府各种农贷的扶助，解决农民的种籽、牲口、肥料，及耕作上的困难。同时市郊大部是水浇地，去冬少雪，今春又缺雨，政府又大力帮助农民购买耕畜三百二十四头，水车二百一十辆，又贷出二万多块砖，帮助农民修井，战胜了春旱的灾荒。这是土改后的第一次麦田丰收，全郊区翻身农民无不热烈欢舞。
