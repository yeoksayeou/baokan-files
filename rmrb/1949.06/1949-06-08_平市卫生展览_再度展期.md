[Beiping News] The Health Exhibition organized by the Health Bureau, since its opening on May 29th, has been extended again due to its rich content (especially the charts and photos of the manufacturing process of B.C.G. and penicillin produced by the Tiantan Anti-epidemic Center have attracted the most attention). The majority of the audience requested that the exhibition be extended again. The bureau has decided to extend the closing date to the 20th of this month.

　　平市卫生展览　再度展期
    【平市讯】卫生局主办之卫生展览自五月二十九日揭幕后，因内容丰富（特别是天坛防疫处的Ｂ·Ｃ·Ｇ及盘尼西林等出品制造程序的图表照片最被注意。）多数观众均要求将展览再行延期。该局已决定将截止期展至本月二十日。
