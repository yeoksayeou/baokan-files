The Preparatory Committee of the Ping Municipal Youth League
Convenes an Enlarged Cadre Meeting of Young Workers
Summarizes Three Months of Factory League Building Experience
Resolves to Overcome the Phenomenon of Being Detached from the Masses in the Future
[This newspaper report] The Youth Work Committee of the Preparatory Committee of the New Democratic Youth League of Beiping Municipality convened its first enlarged cadre meeting since liberation from the 19th to the 21st. Comrade Xiao Ming, director of the Preparatory Committee of the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions, gave a report at the meeting, and Comrade Feng Wenbin, director of the Central Committee of the Youth League, spoke. More than 100 representatives from more than ten units and administrative regions, including the Beiping Clothing Factory, Pingjin Railway Bureau, Beiping Telecommunications Bureau, 70th Ordnance Factory, Mentougou Mining Area, Shijingshan Power Plant, and Steel Plant, attended as League building cadres.

On the 19th, Comrade Wang Shuicong, the person in charge of the Youth Work Committee of the Beiping Municipal Youth League Preparatory Committee, reported on the summary of the factory League building in the past three months. He said: "The three months of League building have been successful. Factory Youth Leagues consisting of more than 1,100 League members have been established, and League members have played a significant role in production, factory protection, and other tasks. However, the League's direction and tasks are not clear, which is due to a lack of specific and in-depth ideological leadership. Some places reflect that they do not care about the demands of the masses and always want to leave the central work ideologically, engage in the League's own set of things, otherwise, it seems that there is no independent content of the League's work. The main reason is: it is not clear that the central tasks of the Party, the administration, and the trade union at that time and place are the central tasks of the League. At the same time, the special requirements and interests of young people have not been taken into account. Therefore, we should closely unite with the masses in the future, combine with the central work, vigorously cooperate with the Party, the administration, and the trade union to develop the workers' movement, take care of the special requirements of young people, and strive to restore and develop production."

On the afternoon of the same day and the morning of the 20th, the cadres were divided into seven groups to discuss the League building's direction and tasks, how to connect with the masses, and the demands of the masses. This discussion implemented a spirit, that is, to overcome the main deviation in the current League's work—being detached from the masses, and strengthen the education of the mass viewpoint and the mass line. At 4 pm on the 20th, all the cadres gathered together for a more in-depth discussion.

Everyone believes that the revolution led by the Communist Party is for the masses, and the revolutionary work must be completed by everyone. The success of the Communist Party's leadership of the revolution is because it has been well connected with the masses. Therefore, first of all, we should clarify our thinking and not regard connecting with the masses as a means of completing our own tasks. We should establish the view of serving the masses and wholeheartedly and honestly be servants for the masses. At the same time, we should proactively and systematically complete the tasks of restoring and developing production together with the masses through the current work in the factory.

On the afternoon of the 20th, Comrade Zhu Rong from the Clothing Factory and Comrade Wang Zhiheng from the Shijingshan Power Plant gave typical reports on the experience of League building, stating in the report that through movements such as production, factory protection, and conservation, active elements were discovered, and after they deeply understood the essence of the League, they were willing to become League members. And said: The consolidation of the League lies in continuous ideological education of the League members and close contact with the masses.

On the last day of the conference, Comrade Yang Bozhen, deputy director of the Preparatory Committee of the Beiping Municipal Youth League, made a conclusion. He said: "Everyone should take back the reports of Comrades Xiao and Feng and the spirit of the conference, and at the same time, study them further. And based on this, check our work, formulate our own plans, cooperate with the Party, the administration, and the trade union, and carefully solve the current demands of the workers." Finally, it was stipulated that a reporting system must be established in the future. At the end, Comrade Zhang Dazhong gave a report on the issue of League member development: The conditions for new League members to join the League, in addition to the provisions of the League Constitution, in accordance with the spirit of the League Constitution, our specific provisions in the factory are: (1) actively involved in production, (2) ideologically progressive, (3) connected with the masses, with a correct style, (4) a clean history.

    青年团平市筹委会
    召开青工扩大干部会
    总结三个月工厂建团经验
    今后决克服脱离群众现象
    【本报讯】新民主主义青年团北平市筹委会青工委员会于十九日至二十一日召开了解放以来第一次扩大干部会议。会上有市总工会筹委会主任萧明同志报告，及青年团中央委会主任冯文彬同志讲话。与会代表有北平被服厂、平津路局、北平电信局、七十兵工厂、门头沟矿区、石景山发电所、钢铁厂等十余单位及行政区的建团干部百余人。
    十九日，青年团北平市筹委会青工委员会负责同志王率从报告了三月来工厂建团的总结，他说：三个月建团是有成绩的，建立了包括一千一百多团员的工厂青年团，团员在生产、护厂等工作上均起了不少的作用。但对团的方针与任务是不明确的，这是因为缺乏具体深入的思想领导。有的地方反映了：对群众要求不关心，思想上总想离开中心工作，搞团的一套，不这样就似乎没有了团的工作的独立内容。其原因主要是：不明确当时当地党、行政、工会的中心任务即是团的中心任务。同时没有照顾到青年的特殊要求与兴趣。因此，我们今后应密切团结群众，结合中心工作，大力配合党、行政、工会发展职工运动，照顾青年的特殊要求，为恢复与发展生产而努力。
    当日下午及二十日上午干部们分成七个小组讨论建团的方针与任务、怎样联系群众及群众要求等问题，这个讨论贯彻了一个精神，即克服目前团的工作上的主要偏向——脱离群众，加强群众观点、走群众路线的教育。二十日下午四时全体干部聚在一起作了更深入的讨论。
    大家认为：共产党领导的革命是为了群众，并且，革命工作要大家来完成，共产党领导革命的成功就因为是很好地联系了群众。因此，首先应在思想上弄明确，不要把联系群众作为完成自己任务的手段，应该树立为群众服务的观点，全心全意老老实实为群众当勤务员。同时，应当主动地有计划地通过当前工厂中的工作，与群众共同完成恢复与发展生产的任务。
    二十日下午，由被服厂朱荣同志及石景山发电所王志恒同志作建团经验的典型报告，在报告中说明：通过生产、护厂、节约等运动，发现积极分子，使他们深刻地了解团的实质后，都愿意成为团员了。并且说：团的巩固在于对团员作不断的思想教育和对群众的紧密联系。
    大会最后一日，由青年团北平市筹委会副主任杨伯箴同志作结论，他说：“各位回去要把萧冯二位同志的报告及大会精神带回去，同时，作更进一步的学习。并以此为根据，检查我们的工作，定出自己的计划，与党、行政、工会配合，慎重解决工人当前的要求”。最后，规定了今后必须建立汇报制度。最末由张大中同志作关于团员发展问题的报告：新团员入团的条件，除团章的规定外，依团章规定的精神，我们在工厂的具体规定是：（一）生产积极，（二）思想前进，（三）联系群众，作风正派，（四）历史清白。
