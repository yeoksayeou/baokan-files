Launch a Mass Wheat Protection Campaign

Since mid-May, the wheat protection campaign in North China, closely coordinated with the wheat harvest, has yielded good results. In areas where the mass wheat protection movement has been carried out effectively, it has not only greatly facilitated the wheat harvest, but also uncovered hidden bandits and special agents, cleared up rumors affecting rural security, and dealt a severe blow to armed bandits and special agents.

The arrangements for wheat protection work in various regions generally began in May. After the North China People's Government issued instructions on wheat protection, administrative offices and counties successively issued orders and instructions based on specific circumstances and made specific arrangements. To unify forces and concentrate command, many counties in the Hebei-Shandong-Henan, Central Hebei, and Southern Hebei regions established unified command posts or joint offices. At the district and village levels, wheat protection committees and militia joint defense organizations were quite common. If something happened in one village, several villages would provide support. The joint defense organized by eight villages in Qinghe County could all be assembled within one hour after a signal was issued. In organizing joint defense, various regions paid special attention to the guard work in the junction areas of counties. The junction area of Wu Ji Fifth District and Xinle Eighth District organized a six-village joint defense command post and stipulated a password system. Reports from many regions prove that actively carrying out the wheat protection struggle, earnestly implementing the Party's policies, further raising the masses' awareness, isolating the conspiracies of certain individual saboteurs, and having the masses themselves establish a good rural order are the urgent demands of the broad masses. Some farmers in Yanggu County, Hebei-Shandong-Henan, said, "Since I was given this land to grow wheat, I have been worried about not being able to harvest it. Now (referring to the establishment of a wheat protection organization), I can rest assured." In organizing wheat protection in the seventh district of Wen'an, Hebei, attention was first paid to exposing the reactionary landlords' conspiracy to take back the peasants' wheat fields, which played a great role in improving the local masses' enthusiasm for protecting wheat. Only when the masses realize that the Party's policy is to resolutely support them, and automatically establish wheat protection organizations, will the hidden bandits and special agents, and all landlords who attempt to launch a counterattack, be immediately isolated, and all their activities will soon be exposed.

The general steps taken in this year's wheat protection struggle in North China were: first, earnestly rectifying armed organizations at all levels. Because of the liberation of the entire North China region, some cadres have developed a relatively serious sense of complacency, and the phenomenon of lax organization and discipline of the militia and local armed forces is quite common. Therefore, the bandit and special agent activities that have occurred have not aroused enough vigilance. In addition, in the militia of the new district, some disbanded Kuomintang soldiers and local bandits have mixed in, and the situation of impure organization is relatively serious. Therefore, in the wheat protection struggle, various regions have paid attention to the necessity of rectifying the people's armed forces ideologically and organizationally. The second is that leading cadres take the lead in organizing a mass wheat protection movement to effectively protect the interests of the masses. The Eighth and Tenth Special Districts of Central Hebei adopted the method of cadres organizing groups separately, then dispersing into the masses, listening to the opinions of the masses, based on the requirements of the masses, and combining with the strength of the masses to combat the bandit and special agent activities that the masses hate and destroy the interests of the masses, which has achieved better results. From mid-May to early June, in less than a month, they captured 169 armed bandits and special agents, including many officials holding important positions as bandits and special agents. The deputy county head of Wen'an County and the deputy captain of the armed forces department led 13 county cadres to the most complex areas where bandits and special agents have consistently been active to assist in wheat protection. In addition to helping the district establish a strong district joint defense headquarters, they also assisted in rectifying the village militia, and laid a preliminary foundation for local security work in a short period of time. The third is to combine armed wheat protection with mobilizing the masses to politically expose the crimes of bandits and special agents and reactionary landlords, to thoroughly isolate and expose bandits and special agents, and to have the masses automatically and actively report their crimes and rumors. After seizing the fact that the landlords in the Seventh District of Wen'an took back the land, in addition to making them publicly admit their mistakes and return the land that had been taken back, widespread publicity was also carried out, which greatly reduced the continued occurrence of such incidents. The rumors of witches were also exposed in a timely manner, and other bad elements were unable to continue to carry out activities to confuse the masses.

Finally, it should be noted that the activities of bandits and special agents will not completely stop even if they are hit by our wheat protection struggle. The most fundamental way to eliminate bandits and special agents is only when we firmly and conscientiously implement the Party's policies, protect the interests of the masses, and closely integrate with the masses, can a good rural order be fundamentally guaranteed. However, to achieve this, all regions must continue to make further efforts based on the experience of the wheat protection struggle.

### 开展群众性的护麦运动

　　开展群众性的护麦运动
    五月中旬以来，华北各地与麦收紧相配合的护麦保麦斗争，已获得良好成果。群众性的护麦运动开展较好的地区，不仅大大便利了麦收的进行，而且清查出隐蔽的匪特，扫清了影响农村治安的流言，并给武装活动的匪特以严重打击。
    各地护麦工作的布置，大体均是在五月份开始的，华北人民政府的护麦指示下达后，各行署、各县均先后依据具体情况，发布命令指示，并作了具体布置。为统一力量，集中指挥，在冀鲁豫、冀中、冀南等区，均有不少县份成立了统一的指挥部或联合办公室。在区、村则相当普遍地成立了护麦委员会及民兵联防组织，一村有事，数村支援，清河县八个村所组织的联防，在发出信号后的一小时内，即可全部集合。各地在组织联防中，特别注意了县与县接合部的警戒工作。无极五区与新乐八区的接合地区，组织六村联防指挥部，并规定了会哨制度。许多地区的报导均证明：从积极的开展护麦斗争中，切实贯彻党的政策，进一步提高群众觉悟，孤立某些个别破坏分子的阴谋，由群众自己起来，建立一个良好的农村秩序，乃是广大群众的迫切要求。冀鲁豫阳谷县有的农民即曾表示：“从分了这块地种上麦子后，就一直耽心收不成，这一来（指建立了护麦组织之后）可就放心了。”冀中文安七区在组织护麦中，首先注意了揭露反动地主阴谋倒回农民麦地的事件，对于提高当地群众的护麦积极性上说，是起了很大作用的。只有群众认识了党的政策是坚决支援他们的，并自动的起来建立了护麦组织之后，暗藏的匪特与一切去谋进行反攻的地主，就会马上被孤立起来了，他们的一切活动很快就会被揭穿。
    今年华北各地在护麦斗争中一般采取的步骤：第一是认真地进行各级武装组织的整顿，由于华北全境解放，在某些干部中已经产生比较严重的太平观念，民兵以及地方武装的组织松懈，纪律废弛的情形也相当普遍，因之对于眼前所发生的匪特活动则未能引起足够的警惕。此外，在新区的民兵中，有的混进了一些遣散还乡的国民党散兵游勇及流氓土匪，组织不纯的情形也比较严重。因此在护麦斗争中，各地都已经注意到：从思想上组织上整顿人民武装的必要。第二是领导干部带头，组织群众性的护麦运动，切实保护群众的利益。冀中八、十两专区采取干部分头组织小组，而后分散到群众中去，倾听群众意见，依据群众要求，并与群众的力量结合，去打击那些为群众所痛恨与破坏群众利益的匪特活动，收效较好。他们从五月中旬到六月上旬不到一个月内，即捕获了武装匪特一百六十九名，其中并有担任匪特要职的官员多名，文安县副县长与武装部副队长带领县干部十三人到环境最复杂土匪一贯活动较多的地方去协助护麦，除帮助区建立了强有力的区联防总队部外，并协助整顿了各村民兵，在较短的时期中，即初步给当地的治安工作奠定了基础。第三是武装护麦与发动群众从政治上揭露匪特及反动地主的罪行相结合，以彻底孤立暴露匪特，由群众自动积极检举其罪行与谣言。文安七区在抓住了地主倒地的事实之后，除使其公开认错并退回已倒去之土地外，并进行了普遍的宣传，此后即大大减少了此类事件的继续发生。对于巫婆的造谣，也进行了及时揭露工作，其他的坏分子即无法再进行迷惑群众的活动。
    最后应该警惕的是匪特的活动并不会因受到我们护麦斗争中的打击就完全甘休的，肃清匪特的最基本的办法，只有当我们坚定地认真地贯彻了党的政策，保护了群众的利益，并紧紧和群众结合之后，良好的农村秩序才有了根本保证，但要做到这一点，各地仍必须在护麦斗争的经验基础上，继续作进一步的努力。
