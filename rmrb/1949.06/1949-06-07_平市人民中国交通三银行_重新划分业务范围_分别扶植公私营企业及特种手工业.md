　　Separately Supporting Public and Private Enterprises and Specialized Handicrafts

　　[This Newspaper's Dispatch] In order to develop loan business and facilitate assistance and support for the recovery and development of public and private enterprises, the Beiping Branch of the People's Bank of China has re-divided its loan business. In addition to the Bank of Communications, the Bank of China, and other specialized banks continuing to undertake various loans in accordance with the latest division of labor plan, the business department of the bank and the East, West, and South branch offices will gradually increase loan business from June onwards based on the specific conditions of each region. In addition to coordinating with the production plans of state-owned and public enterprises to provide effective and necessary loans to assist in their production recovery and development, loans will be issued to private industrial and commercial enterprises (such as exporters, etc.) that are beneficial to the national economy and people's livelihoods, and to industries that promote urban-rural relations and are likely to develop in Beiping's specific conditions. In addition, specialized handicrafts that can be exported will also be supported with loans in coordination with relevant departments. In addition to monetary loans, methods such as price-indexed loans and order-based loans will also be tested. The specific division of labor for each unit is as follows: (1) The business department of the branch bank: undertakes loans designated by higher authorities and general loan business. (2) Bank of Communications: undertakes designated loans to state-owned and public enterprises, and gradually handles larger private enterprise loan business. (3) Bank of China: undertakes specialized handicraft loans related to exports. (4) Each branch office: undertakes loan business for public and private enterprises outside the scope of the branch bank's business department, the Bank of China, and the Bank of Communications, based on the unified division of regions by the branch bank.
