　　Agricultural Situation Brief

　　In Jincheng's seventh district, wheat blight is very serious. More than 20,000 mu of wheat in twenty-three villages throughout the district are affected by blight. The main reasons are late planting, insufficient fertilizer, and failure to select seeds or disinfect them, resulting in weak resistance to cold and disease. Chen Dehe and others, cadres from Xialichuan Village, planted early and used warm salt water to soak the wheat seeds, so they had no blight; some farmers who changed to good wheat seeds also had no blight.

　　Anyang: A grasshopper extermination campaign has formed in the seventh district. Men, women, and children in each village are mobilized together. There are two methods: 1. Burning method: When encircling small slopes, because it is not easy to catch and hit the grasshoppers, the area is surrounded from all sides, driving them towards the middle. When they are squeezed into a small circle, a layer of wheat straw is scattered on top, and the four sides are lit simultaneously, burning the grasshoppers to death, with great effect. 2. Cloth sheet method: After the grasshoppers are driven together, the cloth sheet is placed in the middle. When the grasshoppers get on the cloth, it is forcefully wrapped up to kill them.

　　Handan: Grasshoppers have successively appeared in various counties of the Handan Special District, and in Longyao and Ren counties of the Nangong Special District. Among them, the waterlogged areas of Daming, Yongnian, Chengci, and Handan counties in the Handan Special District last year are the most serious, covering an area of about 160,000 mu. The reeds and tender grass in the grasshopper nymph occurrence areas have been eaten up. Through organized capture and elimination, most have now been captured and destroyed.

　　Wanxian: In the third district, there was a serious epidemic of measles and German measles in May. The number of patients reached 1,520. The district medical association immediately organized 33 member doctors to go to the countryside. By the end of the month, 1,320 people had been cured.

　　Zuoquan: More than twenty villages including Shilidian, more than ten villages in Xiyang, and eleven villages in the fourth district of Huguan suffered a severe hailstorm on the afternoon of the 9th. The hail was more than three fingers thick. Autumn crops, except for those that had not emerged from the soil, suffered heavy losses, and wheat was also damaged. County leaders are actively organizing cadres to go to the disaster areas to organize the masses to replant and reseed.

　　On the 6th, 7th, and 8th, most areas of twenty-two counties including Qingxian and Gaoyang in central Hebei successively suffered hailstorms. The duration was more than ten minutes to one hour. Panggezhuang and other places in Daxing were the most severely affected. The larger hailstones were the size of teacups or chicken eggs. After the rain, the hail accumulated four fingers thick and the water was nearly a foot deep. Eighty to ninety percent of the wheat grains were damaged. The crops were all destroyed. In the Liujiatou area of the sixth district of Suning, the hail accumulated half a foot, and the wheat ears and leaves were all smashed off. After the disaster, local governments urgently sent cadres to investigate the disaster situation and lead farmers to sow late crops and rush to collect wheat grains. Suning has prepared 5,000 jin each of small peanut and late seedling seeds, which will soon be loaned out.

　　Southern Hebei: A short-term training class for animal epidemic prevention and control has been opened for one month. The class started on June 1st with a total of twenty students. The content of the study focuses on rabbit-adapted rinderpest virus, as well as physiology, anatomy, treatment, epidemic prevention, drugs, and other courses. The surrounding villages within fifteen li are designated as epidemic prevention practice areas, with practice once a week.

　　The second team for animal epidemic prevention and control of the North China People's Government Ministry of Agriculture, which went to the Taiyue area, carried out livestock epidemic prevention injections in Yangcheng, Yuanqu, Jiyuan and other places in May, with a total of 7,999 anthrax preventive injections and 4,842 rinderpest preventive injections, which were very popular among farmers.

　　农情简报
    晋城七区霉麦非常严重。全区二十三个村共霉麦二万余亩。原因主要是种麦迟、上粪小，没选种或没浸种消毒，抗寒抗病力弱。下犁川村干部陈德和等，种的早，麦种又用温盐水浸过，都没霉；农民有的换的好麦种也没霉。
    安阳　七区剿蝗形成运动。各村男女老少一齐出动，方法有二：一、火烧法：小坡围剿时，因不易捉打，便从四面包围，向中间赶，挤成小圈时，把麦秸散上一层，四边同时点火，蝗虫便被烧死，效果很大。二、布单法：将蝗围赶在一起后，将布单放在中间，待蝗虫到布上时，用力包起来，治死。
    邯郸　专区各县、南宫专区隆尧、任县等县相继发生蝗虫。其中以邯郸专区大名、永年、成磁、邯郸等去年水淹地区最为严重。面积约有十六万亩。蝗蝻发生地芦苇嫩草已吃光。经组织捕打，现大部已被捕灭。
    完县　三区五月份曾严重流行小儿麻疹、瘟疹。患者达一千五百二十人。区医联当即组织会员医生三十三人下乡，截至月底已医好一千三百二十人。
    　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　（杨玉亭）
    左权　十里店等二十余村、昔阳十余村、壶关四区十一个村，九日下午又遭严重雹灾。雹落三指多厚，秋禾除未出土者外，损失很重，麦子也受损失，各县领导正积极组织干部分赴灾区组织群众改种补种。
    六、七、八三日冀中青县、高阳等二十二个县大部地区相继降雹成灾。时间十余分钟至一点钟。大兴庞各庄等地最严重，大者如茶碗鸡蛋，雨后积雹四指、水深近尺，麦粒砸坏十分之八九。庄稼苗全被打坏。肃宁六区刘甲头一带雹积半尺，麦穗树叶均被砸光。灾后各地政府紧急派干部调查灾情，领导农民播种晚田，抢扫麦粒。肃宁已备妥小花生及晚苗种子各五千斤，即将贷发。
    冀南　开兽疫防治短期训练班，时间一个月，已于六月一日开课，学员共二十名。学习内容以兔化牛瘟毒为主，及生理解剖学、治疗、防疫、药物等课，并划周围十五里内村为防疫实习区一周实习一次。（张式谷）
    去太岳区的华北人民政府农业部兽疫防治第二队，五月份在阳城、垣曲、济源等地进行牲畜防疫注射，计炭疸预防注射七千九百九十九次；牛瘟预防注射四千八百四十二次。很受农民欢迎。
