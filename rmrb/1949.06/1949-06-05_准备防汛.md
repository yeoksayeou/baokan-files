　　Preparing for Flood Prevention

    Based on the lessons of "spring drought and autumn flooding" over the years, while the people of North China are actively fighting drought, they should also pay close attention to flood prevention work. This year, all of North China has been liberated. The past enemy's division and blockade, control of rivers, and destruction of dikes to use water as a weapon, which gave us restrictions and difficulties in river management and flood prevention, no longer exist. Since large and small rivers are all within the embrace of the liberated areas, it is easy to grasp the flood situation upstream and downstream, and the flood prevention pace is easy to unify. The problems in flood prevention work seem to be not big. This is very easy to paralyze ourselves; we must understand that most of the rivers in our region have been in disrepair for many years, especially in the newly liberated areas, where the dikes are dilapidated. This year, we are only repairing them selectively within the possible range. The general dikes have not been strengthened universally. In addition, there is a lack of rain in the spring, and the rainfall in summer and autumn may be concentrated. Therefore, this year's flood prevention is still an arduous and serious task, and there must be no carelessness.
    Our flood prevention experience of more than ten years mainly relies on the masses to defend strictly. For example, last year in the Huto River in central Hebei, to protect the dike section of Wu Mao Ying that was about to be submerged, 3,000 people were mobilized to rescue and protect it for three days and nights, protecting the production of more than one million mu of land in seven counties in the hinterland. The Ziya River broke the highest record of flood flow, and at the cost of 610,000 workdays, the entire left bank and most of the right bank farmland were preserved. Other areas also have similar situations and experiences. In addition, we also have painful lessons, mainly due to paralysis and carelessness, lax defense, thinking that there is no water in the river, there is nothing to prevent, not going to the dike in advance, and only rushing to rescue when mountain floods burst, with insufficient materials and manpower, and some even with the water already rising sharply, there were still no people or materials on the dike, allowing the water to wash away the riverbank until the breach. For example, last year's breaches of the Zhulong River's Qianli Dike at Mengchang and Kanwei, and the south Zhao Fu breach on the right dike of the Ziya River were examples of lax defense. Other areas also have similar situations and lessons.
    The North China People's Government has issued instructions on flood prevention work, and all localities should earnestly implement them. We believe that in flood prevention work, prior preparation is extremely important. This year, regardless of whether the water is large or small, we must be fully prepared in spirit and action, so that we can reap the benefit of being prepared for any eventuality. If some areas experienced a large flood last year and think that there will be no large flood this year, or some areas did not experience a large flood last year and think that there will still be no large flood this year, and therefore hold blind optimism or a fluke mentality about this year's flood prevention, it will weaken the preparation for flood prevention and cause unnecessary disasters, which is absolutely unacceptable.
    Now there is still more than a month before the flood season. We must make good use of this time to complete the unfinished projects. If they cannot be completed before the flood season, we must also transport the materials to the work section for temporary emergency rescue. Secondly, all new and old dikes should be strictly inspected and tested, filling in wave nests, water eyes, rat holes, and badger burrows. This year we are selectively building dangerous works, and the inspection and testing of ordinary works is particularly important, because dangerous works are easily noticed, while ordinary works are easily relaxed. In the past, breaches often occurred in ordinary work sections, and this lesson of blood must be remembered. To prevent problems before they occur, all localities should immediately formulate specific flood prevention plans, communicate and deploy them in depth, and prepare to fight resolutely against the possible floods and huge waves with the spirit of overcoming drought.

### 准备防汛

　　准备防汛
    鉴于历年“春旱秋涝”的教训，当此华北人民积极抗旱的时候，同时应当深切注意到防汛工作。今年华北全境已获解放，过去敌人的分割封锁，控制河流，破坏堤防以水代兵等，所给予我们在治河防汛中的限制和困难，均已不复存在，由于大小河流都在解放区怀抱，上下游汛情容易掌握，防汛步调也容易一致，防汛工作上的问题似乎已不大，这点很容易麻痹我们自己；必须了解：我区河流大部系多年失修，特别是新解放地区堤防残破不堪，今年只是在可能范围内择险修整，一般堤防还没有普遍加强，再加春季缺雨，夏秋可能雨量集中。因此，今年的防汛仍是艰巨而严重的任务，不可有任何粗心大意。
    我们十余年的防汛经验，主要是依靠群众严密防守，如冀中去年滹沱河抢护武毛营被漫顶的堤段，发动了三千余群众，抢护三昼夜，保护了腹心七县百余万亩的生产；子牙河打破洪水流量的最高纪录，用六十一万工的代价，保全了左岸全部和右岸大部的农田，其他地区也都有类似的情况和经验。另外我们也有痛苦的教训，这主要的是，麻痹大意，疏于防守，认为河里没水，没什么可防的，不提前上堤，等到山洪暴涨，才仓慌抢护，物料人力都不充分，有的甚至水已盛涨，堤上尚无人无料，任水冲刷堤岸直至决口。如去年冀中潴龙河千里堤孟尝和坎苇与子牙河右堤南赵扶决口，就是疏于防守的例子，其他地区也都有类似的情况和教训。
    华北人民政府已发出关于防汛工作的指示，各地应认真贯彻执行。我们认为，在防汛工作中，事先的准备工作占着极其重要的地位，今年无论水大水小，我们在精神上行动上均须作充分准备，这样才能收有备无患之效，如果某些地区去年发了大水，而认为今年即不发大水了，或某些地区，去年未发大水，而认为今年仍不会发大水，因而对今年的防汛抱着盲目乐观或存侥幸心理，都会削弱防汛的准备工作，造成不应有的灾害，这是绝对要不得的。
    现在距汛期还有一个多月，我们要很好地利用这个时机完成未完的工程，假如汛前不能完成，也要把料物运至工段，以备临时抢险。其次新堤旧堤一律进行严格的检查签试，填堵浪窝水眼，鼠穴獾洞。我们今年是择要修筑险工，对平工的检查签试则尤为重要，因为险工易被注意，平工易被放松，过去决口也多发生在平工地段，这一血的教训必须记取。为防患于未然，各地应即作出防汛的具体计划，深入传达布置，以战胜亢旱的精神，准备与可能发生的洪水巨浪作坚决斗争。
