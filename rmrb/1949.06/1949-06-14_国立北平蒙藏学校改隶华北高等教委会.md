　　[Peiping City News] During the Japanese puppet regime's rule over North China, the National Peiping Mongolian Tibetan School was successively under the direct jurisdiction of the puppet "North China Political Affairs Commission Administrative Department" and "Ministry of Internal Affairs"; during the Kuomintang rule, it was under the "Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission" and the "Ministry of Education." After the liberation of Peiping, on April 4th, Comrade Huang Jingtao, dispatched by the Inner Mongolia government, took over as the principal of the school and formally took over the school, which was temporarily under the leadership of the Peiping Municipal People's Government Education Bureau. Subsequently, considering that the school was different from ordinary municipal schools in terms of administration, curriculum, and equipment, it was submitted to the North China People's Government for approval on the 10th of this month, and it was reassigned to the leadership of the North China Higher Education Committee starting from June.

　　国立北平蒙藏学校改隶华北高等教委会
    【平市讯】国立北平蒙藏学校在日伪统治华北时，曾先后直辖于伪“华北政务委员会行政部”“内务总署”；在国民党统治时期，又属“蒙藏委员会”及“教育部”。北平解放后，四月四日，该校由内蒙政府所派之黄静涛同志担任校长，正式接管，暂由北平市人民政府教育局领导。嗣以该校在行政上、课程上、设备上，多与市立一般学校不同，本月十日呈经华北人民政府批准，自六月份起改隶华北高等教育委员会领导。
