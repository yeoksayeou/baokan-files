(Taihang Electricity) In this year's Great Production Movement, cooperative societies at the county, district, and village levels in Neiqiu, Xiyang, Yushe, Lucheng, Huixian, Wenxian, and other places in Taihang have achieved considerable success in resolving the livestock difficulties of their members. The Neiqiu County United Cooperative plans to complete the purchase of 200 head of livestock before the wheat harvest, and has already purchased 97 head, which are being systematically sold to members. The Xiyang Eighth District United Cooperative purchased nine head of livestock from Lanxian, Jinxi Northwest. The Chuankou Village Cooperative in the county correctly used agricultural loans to purchase five head of livestock, solving the livestock power difficulties of five households including Wang Piyuan. The Third District United Cooperative of the county, starting from long-term animal husbandry, bought a male donkey and established a livestock breeding station, assigning a dedicated person to be responsible. Four days after the purchase, it was used for breeding eight times. The Wenxian County United Cooperative originally planned to buy 60 head of livestock before the wheat harvest, but has now purchased 67 head. The Huixian County United Cooperative purchased 21 head.
