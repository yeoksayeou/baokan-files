Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, June 11th: Moscow dispatch: Soviet economist Dyachenko, in an article recently published in the magazine "Economic Issues," stated that shortening production time and accelerating the turnover of working capital have achieved significant successes in major Soviet industries. For example, this year, the turnover of working capital at the "Sverdlov Transport Machinery Manufacturing Plant" has accelerated by 25%, and the total value of goods produced per ruble of working capital has increased from 2 rubles 89 kopecks to 3 rubles 48 kopecks. Last year, the turnover of working capital at the Ural Machinery Manufacturing Plant accelerated almost twofold compared to the pre-war year of 1940, and the total value of goods produced per ruble of working capital increased from 1 ruble 17 kopecks in 1940 to 2 rubles 29 kopecks.

Another article published in the economics magazine, discussing the role of labor reserves in increasing labor productivity, stated that vocational school graduates are victoriously competing with other workers in completing plans ahead of schedule. For example, in the main departments of the Moscow "Red Proletarian" factory, 40% of young workers are Stakhanovite movement members. 20% of young machinists have mastered high-speed hardware manufacturing methods. 63.5% of young workers exceeded production quotas by more than 25%.

　　苏工业中加速流动资金周转
  　产品总值增加一倍
    【新华社北平十一日电】莫斯科讯：苏联名经济学家第雅琴科在最近出版的“经济问题”杂志中发表一篇文章，说明缩短生产时间，加速流动资金周转，已在苏联各主要工业中得到重要成就。例如，今年“斯维德洛夫运输机器制造厂”流动资金的周转，已加速了百分之二十五，流动资金每一卢布所生产货物的总值，已从二卢布八十九哥比增加到三卢布四十八哥比。去年，乌拉尔机器制造厂流动资金的周转，比战前一九四○年几乎加快了一倍，流动资金每一卢布所生产货物的总值，从一九四○年的一卢布十七哥比增加到二卢布二十九哥比。
    经济杂志刊载另一篇文章，论述劳动后备力在提高劳动生产率方面所起的作用称：职业学校毕业生在提前完成计划方面，正与其他工人胜利地进行竞赛。例如，在莫斯科“红色无产者”工厂的各主要部门中，百分之四十的青年工人是斯塔哈诺夫运动者。百分之二十的青年机工掌握了高速度的五金制造方法。百分之六十三点五的青年工人则超过了生产定额百分之二十五以上。
