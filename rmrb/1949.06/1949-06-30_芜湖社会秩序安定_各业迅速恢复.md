Xinhua News Agency, Wuhu, 28th: Following the establishment of the Wuhu Municipal People's Government, social order has become increasingly stable, and various sectors such as industry, commerce, post and telecommunications, and transportation are gradually recovering. The city's water and electricity supply has never been interrupted. Yangtze River shipping reaches Wuhan to the west and connects to Nanjing and Shanghai to the east. The Wuhu-Nanjing section of the Jiangnan Railway was opened to traffic on the day of liberation. All stores in the city, including more than 300 rice merchants, have gradually reopened, and material exchanges with Shanghai, Wuhan, and southern Anhui are also becoming more frequent. The Wuhu Rice Mill, the private Yuzhong Yarn Factory which had been shut down for half a year, the large-scale Wuhu Oil Pressing Factory, the state-owned Anhui Firecracker Factory, the state-owned Fuli Iron Factory, and eleven private iron factories have all resumed production. Workers' enthusiasm for production is high. The Fuli Iron Factory had been shut down for six months before liberation, but after starting work this time, the workers completed the repair and cleaning of all the machines in three days. Twelve days after starting work, they repaired a 14-foot lathe, an 8-foot lathe, a completely broken 6-foot lathe, and Wuhu's only large lighter, which had been damaged by the Japanese invaders. All 54 large, medium, and primary schools in the city have also fully resumed classes, with more than 18,000 students attending.

　　芜湖社会秩序安定
  　各业迅速恢复
    【新华社芜湖二十八日电】芜湖市人民政府成立后，社会秩序日益安定，工商、邮电、交通等各业正次第恢复中。市内水电供应从未间断。长江航运西达武汉，东通京沪。江南铁路芜湖至南京段，在解放当天即已通车。全市商店，包括三百余家米商在内，已陆续开业，与沪、汉及皖南各地的物资交流亦渐频繁。芜湖碾米厂，停工已半年的私营裕中纱厂，规模较大的芜湖榨油厂，公营安徽省火柴厂，公营富利铁工厂，及十一家私营铁工厂均已恢复生产。工人生产情绪高涨。富利铁工厂解放前已停工六个月，但此次开工后三天，工人即将全部机器修理洗刷完毕。开工后十二天，又修好了一丈四尺车床一部，八尺车床一部，一部完全坏了的六尺车床，和被日寇打坏了的芜湖唯一的大趸船。全市大、中、小学校五十四所，也已全部复课，到校学生一万八千余人。
