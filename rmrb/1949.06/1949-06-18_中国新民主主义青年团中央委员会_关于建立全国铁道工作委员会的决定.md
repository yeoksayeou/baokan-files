    The Central Committee of the China New Democratic Youth League
    Decision on Establishing the National Railway Working Committee
    (June 15, 1949)
    1. In order to unify the leadership of the Youth League in the national railway system and to carry out the work of the Youth League among railway youth workers, the Central Committee of the Youth League has specially decided to establish the "National Railway Working Committee of the China New Democratic Youth League", with Comrades Lu Ping, Yue Zhijian, Zhang Yongwei, Jia Shouyi, and Li Jiebo as members, and Comrades Lu Ping and Yue Zhijian as Secretary and Deputy Secretary respectively.
    2. The tasks of the National Railway Working Committee of the Youth League are: to cooperate with the Railway Trade Union to carry out the railway workers' movement, and to develop a large number of Youth League members from among the activists emerging from the entire workers' movement, and to establish Youth League organizations; to educate railway youth workers with Marxism, Leninism, and Mao Zedong Thought, and to lead them to actively engage in the construction of the people's railways. And be responsible for preparing for the National Railway Youth League Congress, and formally elect the committee.
    3. After the establishment of the National Railway Working Committee of the Youth League, all the work of the Youth League in the national railway system will be unified under its leadership. Wherever a leading body of the Railway Youth League has been established, a leadership relationship will be established; in places where organizations have not been established, the National Railway Working Committee will send working groups or instructors to establish a Youth League Working Committee to carry out Youth League building work as needed. It is hoped that the working teams and cadres sent to the railway by the Youth League committees of various regions will contact the National Railway Working Committee upon receiving this decision. However, the Youth League committees of various regions should still vigorously assist in the establishment and development of railway youth work. Cadres or working teams already sent to the railway should generally not be transferred. If there is a special need for transfer, it must be approved by the higher-level Youth League committee. At present, the national railway has not been completely unified, and the National Railway Working Committee of the Youth League has just been established and its structure is not yet sound. The Youth League committees of various regions still maintain leadership over the railway Youth League committees (working groups of the working committee) under their jurisdiction, but the instructions or decisions of the National Railway Working Committee of the Youth League must be earnestly guaranteed to be implemented and must not be changed. If there are different opinions, they can be proposed to the higher level step by step. In the future, the transfer of cadres should be the unified responsibility of the Railway Youth League Committee according to the system of the Railway Youth League.
    4. The organizational structure and system of the Railway Youth League should be consistent with the administrative division and system of the railway. That is, the National Railway Youth League Working Committee, the General Bureau Youth League Committee, the Administration Bureau Youth League Committee, the Branch Bureau Youth League Committee, the General Branch, and the Branch should be established at all levels. The cadres needed by the Youth League committees or working committees at all levels of the railway are decided to be the responsibility of the Youth League committees of various regions to equip the cadres needed by the Youth League committees at all levels of the railway within their jurisdiction, and to complete the main cadres of the railway branch bureaus, management bureaus, and general bureaus before the end of the month. In terms of cadre qualifications, the secretary of the Youth League Committee of each General Bureau should be a member of the Youth League Committee of each strategic region or equivalent to the secretary of the Provincial Youth League Committee. The secretaries of the Youth League committees of the Management Bureau and the Branch Bureau should be equivalent to the secretaries of the Youth League committees of the Prefectural Committee. All localities must also report the cadre allocation situation and list to the Central Committee of the Youth League.
