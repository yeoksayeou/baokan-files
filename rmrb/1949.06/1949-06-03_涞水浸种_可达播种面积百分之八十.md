　　Laishui Seed Soaking
  　Can Reach 80 Percent of Sowing Area
    [Chahar News] In order to improve farming techniques and achieve increased production, the Pingxi area is widely promoting seed soaking during spring planting. Judging from the current situation, Laishui is doing a good job. Out of 173 villages and 16,540 households in the county, 12,465 households have soaked their seeds. The original requirement was for 80 percent of households to soak their seeds. As of May 10th, those soaking seeds had reached 74.5 percent, with a total of 1,228 dou of seeds soaked, covering a sowing area of 91,329 mu, accounting for 60.7 percent of the total land area. They are now making a concentrated effort to plant on slopes, and it is estimated that the requirement will be met upon completion of sowing. Why have such great results been achieved? (1) Leading cadres at the county and district levels have mastered seed soaking techniques. Before the county-level cadres went to the countryside, the Industrial Department gathered cadres from various departments together, conducted seed soaking experiments, and explained the specific method of seed soaking such as the ratio of water, water temperature, and time. Seed soaking experiment sites were also established in various market towns to promote the technology, enabling all farmers to learn how to soak seeds. (2) Extensive publicity is combined with specific organizational work. Initially, some people did not understand the meaning of seed soaking and clung to old habits. For example, some said: "We have always dry-planted, and we get grain every year!" According to the ideological tendencies of the masses, various meetings were held for ideological education and technical education. Yang Mao (a party member), the director of the Konggezhuang forestry department, in order to encourage everyone to soak seeds, first planted soaked seeds and unsoaked seeds at the same time. After four or five days, he organized the villagers to visit his field. Sure enough, the soaked seeds had sprouted and emerged from the soil, while the unsoaked seeds had not yet taken root. This vivid example educated everyone, and the number of people using soaked seeds in the village has exceeded 80 percent. (3) Problems are solved in a timely manner. For example, Zhao Huanwen of Pengtou Village miscalculated the time when soaking seeds and cooked the seeds. His wife was angry and quarreled with him: "You're messing around, wasting the seeds!" Some people used four parts boiling water to one part cool water (it should be two parts boiling water to one part cool water) for soaking, and the temperature was too high, scalding the seeds. These problems were discovered and resolved in a timely manner, and all villages were notified to pay attention. (Tian Ya'fu, Office of Pingxi District Committee)

　　涞水浸种
  　可达播种面积百分之八十
    【察哈尔讯】为改良耕作技术，以达增产目的，平西地区在春耕播种中普遍号召浸种。就目前情况来看，以涞水为好，全县一百七十三个村，一万六千五百四十户，浸种的就有一万二千四百六十五户，原要求作到百分之八十户浸种，截至五月十日止，浸种者已达百分之七十四点五，共浸种一千二百二十八斗，播种面积九万一千三百二十九亩，占总土地面积百分之六十点七，现正在突击坡地播种，估计播种完毕，定能达到要求。为什么能获这样大的成绩呢？（一）县区领导干部掌握了浸种技术。在县级干部下乡前，实业科将各部门干部集合一起，作了浸种试验，给大家讲解了水量的比重，水的温度及时间等浸种方法。又在各个集市上设立了浸种试验场，推广了技术，使全体农民都学会了浸种办法。（二）广泛宣传和具体组织工作相结合，开始有些群众不了解浸种意义，固守旧习，如有的说：“历年来都是干种，哪年不打粮食呀！”根据群众的思想偏向，召开了各种不同的会议进行思想教育和技术教育。孔各庄林木主任杨茂（党员）同志，为带动大家浸种，首先将浸过的种子和未浸的种子同时点水种上，过了四五天，便组织全村群众到他地里去看，果然浸过的已生芽出土，未浸过的尚未扎根。以这种活生生的实例，教育了大家，该村用浸种下种者已超过百分之八十以上。（三）发生问题及时解决。如蓬头村赵焕文，在浸种时算错了时间，把种子煮熟了，他老婆生气的和他吵：“你瞎闹，把种子糟踏了！”有的群众用四开一凉的水浸（应两开一凉）温度过高，把种子烫坏了。发现这些问题及时解决并通知各村，提起了注意。（平西地委办公室田亚夫）
