Xinhua News Agency, Peiping, June 9th: According to TASS, Paris: After holding three secret meetings, the Foreign Ministers of the Soviet Union, the United States, Britain, and France turned to public session (plenary session) on June 7th to continue discussing the second item on the agenda—Berlin and the currency issue, with British Foreign Secretary Bevin as chairman.

　　Soviet Foreign Minister Vyshinsky spoke first, giving a detailed analysis of the proposals on the Berlin issue put forward by the Soviet and American delegations. Vyshinsky said that, basically, we are faced with two issues: the restoration of a city government for all of Berlin and the reconstruction of the Berlin Quadripartite Command.

　　The first part of Vyshinsky's speech pointed out that the Berlin city government was elected in 1946 according to the electoral law approved by the representatives of the four occupying powers, and it exercised its functions until the autumn of 1948. The Soviet Union had suggested authorizing the Berlin Four-Power Allies Command to supervise the holding of free elections throughout the city to restore the city-wide government. However, this supervision must be carried out in the same way as it was during the October 1946 elections. However, the US delegation's proposal at the Foreign Ministers' meeting on June 6th for the four allies to supervise the election avoided the question of whether the implementation of this supervision would be the same as in the 1946 election. Since there will be no city government before the election, a committee of Germans must be organized to handle the Berlin elections. This committee must be composed on an equal footing, that is, based on the principle of equal representation between the Soviet zone (one side) and the Western zones (the other side). This principle of establishing a committee is fully appropriate and fair, because due to the measures taken by the three Western countries, Berlin has in fact been divided into two parts, and both parts must have representatives to participate in the election committee.

　　Vyshinsky then mentioned the issue of who has the right to participate in the election. He pointed out that the clauses of the 1946 electoral law regarding this issue should be amended to narrow the scope of those deprived of the right to participate in the election.

　　In conducting the election, the right to nominate candidates is extremely important. In this regard, the 1946 electoral law is insufficient. Article 8 of this electoral law must be amended so that all political parties licensed in Berlin and all mass organizations approved by the Four-Power Command have the right to designate candidates in the election.

　　四外长会议转为公开　续讨论柏林问题
  　维辛斯基详尽分析苏美建议
    【新华社北平九日电】据塔斯社巴黎讯：在举行三次秘密会议之后，苏美英法四国外长于六月七日转为公开会议（全体会议），继续讨论会议第二项议程——柏林与货币问题，由英外相贝文任主席。
    苏外长维辛斯基首先发言，他详尽分析苏联代表团和美国代表团关于柏林问题所提出的建议。维辛斯基说，基本上说来，摆在我们面前的是两个问题，即恢复全柏林范围的市政府和重建柏林四国司令部。
    维辛斯基发言的第一部分指出，柏林市政府是在一九四六年根据四占领国代表所批准的选举法选出的，它执行职权直至一九四八年秋。苏联曾建议授权由柏林四盟国司令监督举行全市性的自由选举，以恢复全市范围的市政府，不过，这一监督必须和一九四六年十月选举时一样的进行。但是，美国代表团六月六日在外长会议上所提由四盟国监督选举的建议，却避开了一个问题，即这一监督的实行是否是和一九四六年选举时一样。由于在选举之前不会有市政府，所以，必须组织德国人的委员会来办理柏林的选举。这个委员会必须按同等原则组成，即根据苏占区（一方）与西占区（另一方）平等代表权的原则。这一建立委员会的原则，充分合宜和公平，因为由于西方三国所采取的措施，柏林实际上被分裂为两部分，两部分必须都有代表参加办理选举的委员会。
    维辛斯基然后提到谁有权参加选举的问题。他指出，应该修改一九四六年选举法关于这一问题的条款，以缩小被剥夺参加选举者的范围。
    在进行选举中，提出候选人的权利是极为重要的。在这方面，一九四六年的选举法是不够的，这一选举法的第八条必须予以修改，以便在柏林获得许可的一切政党与四国司令部所核准的一切群众团体，都有权在选举中指定候选人。
