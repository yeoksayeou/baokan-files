  　Supplies Seeds, Purchases Products
    Encourages Diversified Cash Crops
    [Taihang Telegram] This spring, the Taihang Trading Company has played a significant role in assisting farmers in planting industrial raw material crops. First, it stimulated farmers' interest in planting special crops by purchasing white oil, peanuts, cotton, and hemp skin at higher prices. Second, it supplied farmers with large quantities of special crop seeds, red alum for killing pests, and tung oil for repairing waterwheels. The Xinxiang branch purchased 110,000 jin of peanut seeds from other regions, ensuring the timely planting of 90,000 mu of peanuts in Qinyang, Xiuwu, Wuzhi, Huojia, Huixian, and Jixian counties. The district company transported 3,400 jin of red alum from Zhengzhou for farmers to kill insects and prevent pests; it also transported 20,000 jin of tung oil from other regions to supply farmers for repairing waterwheels. However, because there was no conscious leadership from the cooperatives, this work was not timely enough. For example, in the Xingtai area, there was a shortage of peanut seeds until May, which affected farmers' planting of peanuts.

  　供给种子收购产品
    鼓励多种经济作物
    【太行电】太行贸易公司今春在帮助农民播种工业原料作物上发挥了相当作用。第一、以较高价格收购白油、花生、棉花、麻皮，刺激了农民对特种作物的种植兴趣。第二、大批供给农民以特种作物的种子、杀灭虫害的红矾，修建水车的桐油。新乡分公司由外区购来花生种子十一万斤，保证了沁阳、修武、武陟，获嘉、辉县、汲县九万亩花生的按时种植。区公司由郑州运回红矾三千四百斤，供农民杀虫防害之用；又从外区运进桐油两万斤，供给农民修治水车。但因没有有意识的领导合作社来做，这件工作还表现的不及时。如邢台地区，直到五月还缺乏花生种子，影响农民对花生的种植。
