　　North China People Fight Disaster with All Their Might
　　Sowing Mostly Completed Throughout the Region
　　Cotton Planting Completes 90% of Original Plan
　　[Special Dispatch from This Newspaper] After a victorious struggle against disasters such as drought, insects, wind, hail, and frost, sowing work in the North China region has now been mostly completed, with particularly great achievements in the sowing of cash crops. The region has completed planting 12 million mu of cotton, accounting for 92.3% of the original plan of 13 million mu. Ji Central and Taihang have both exceeded the original plan. Incomplete statistics from areas such as Ji East, Ji South, Ji Luyu, Chahar, and Taihang show that 3,759,578 mu of peanuts have been planted, reaching 74.5% of the original plan of 5 million mu, with Taihang exceeding the original plan by 100%. The sowing of castor beans in various places has exceeded the original target. For example, Chahar Province originally planned for 5.6 million jin (calculated at 4 liang of income per plant), but now it can reach more than 7 million jin. During the sowing period of castor beans, a movement was formed in some areas. In Suiyuan, Chahar, Yanbei, and Chabei, about 1 million mu of flax were planted. Taihang planted 110,000 mu of hemp and 90,000 mu of white sesame. Due to the expansion of the planting area of special crops, various places have also paid attention to planting high-yield substitute food crops. For example, in Qian'an, Ji East, sweet potato planting increased from 2,750 mu last year to 4,550 mu this year, with each mu producing 2,000 jin, which can replace the food for 50,000 people for three months. Wen'an and Jinghai in Ji Central, and Chicheng in Chahar, have expanded paddy fields by more than 6,000 mu. The completion of sowing this year despite all difficulties is mainly due to the fact that leaders at all levels have overcome the laissez-faire phenomenon in production leadership since the beginning of spring. Since April, various places have made production work the center of current work. At that time, the drought was severe, so to urgently mobilize drought resistance and rush planting, the masses were mobilized to fight against the drought. A large number of work teams were organized. In Ji Central alone, more than 14,000 cadres were transferred, and in Ji South, more than 4,000 cadres were transferred to go deep into districts and villages to provide specific leadership, which played a great role in grasping agricultural conditions in a timely manner and solving specific problems. Secondly, in mobilizing the masses to resist drought and sow seeds, the idea of "man can conquer nature" was clearly established, breaking the侥幸 psychological dependence on heaven. In areas with waterwheels, wells, and rivers, the masses were organized to water and sow seeds, and waterwheels, wells, and canals were repaired to expand the cultivated area. In Ji South, Ji Central, Ji East, and Chahar, 7,935 old waterwheels were repaired, 8,746 new waterwheels were added, and 5,676 brick wells were dug. The water conservancy promotion societies in Ji Central and Chahar provinces sold more than 3,420 waterwheels during the drought resistance and sowing period. In Ji East, shops and iron and wood factories also lent out 400 waterwheels. Six regions, including Ji Central, Ji Luyu, Taihang, and Taiyue, organized the masses to dig rivers and canals, increasing watered land by 600,000 mu. In areas without water wells, all efforts were concentrated on leading the masses to dig earthen wells, fetch water, or pull water to sow seeds. Incomplete statistics from Ji Central, Ji East, Chahar, and Ji South show that more than 120,000 earthen wells were dug, ensuring the smooth completion of cotton planting on more than 1 million mu. In the fight against drought, the masses created methods such as dry-land sowing, moisture-retaining sowing, and cotton ridge seedling cultivation, thus overcoming the difficulties of sowing in some areas due to drought. Thirdly, the labor force of men, women, old and young was organized together, overcoming the labor difficulties in drought resistance and sowing. In Leting, Luanxian, and Changli counties in Ji East, 10,284 mutual aid groups were organized during the drought resistance and rush planting. In 24 districts of 7 counties including Leting, 81,136 women participated in sowing. In Yinyangli Village, Zhentang County, Ji South, 33 village cadres and party members took the lead in organizing 44 mutual aid groups. Men dug wells and carried water, while women and children dug pits and sowed seeds, ensuring timely rush planting. In Zhang Ruifeng's group in Longhuadian Village, Hejian County, Ji Central, 8 people (6 young and middle-aged women, 1 old man and 1 old woman) carried water when they were young, dug pits and sowed seeds when they were old, and planted 39 mu of cotton. The mountain women in Qian'an County, Ji East, who had no habit of participating in agricultural labor, also participated in sowing with more than 18,000 people this year under the call of "labor is glorious" and "man will conquer nature". Finally, the good autumn plowing results last year also laid a good foundation for spring plowing and sowing. Experience in various places has proved that land that was plowed last autumn can be sown and sprouted even if it is slightly dry this spring, otherwise sowing will be difficult. In addition, preparations for spring plowing this year were relatively sufficient. Various places repaired farm tools, purchased livestock, and built water conservancy projects, starting early in February and March to complete manure delivery and plowing. The government distributed 12.39 million jin of loan grain, 8 million jin of relief grain, and a large number of loans to support agricultural production, combined with trade companies, shops, production promotion societies, cooperatives, etc., to solve the actual difficulties in farmers' production through operation and sales, which also played a great role in this year's drought resistance and rush planting.

　　华北人民全力和灾害斗争
  　全区播种大部完成
    棉花播种完成原计划百分之九十
    【本报特讯】全力和旱、虫、风、雹、霜冻等灾害进行胜利的斗争以后，华北全区播种工作现已大部完成，特别是经济作物的播种获得很大成绩。全区棉花播种完成一千二百万亩，占原计划一千三百万亩的百分之九十二点三，冀中、太行均超过原定计划。花生播种仅据冀东、冀南、冀鲁豫、察哈尔、太行等地不完全统计，已播种三百七十五万九千五百七十八亩，达原计划五百万亩的百分之七十四点五，太行超过原计划一倍。各地大麻子播种均超过原定任务，如察省原计划五百六十万斤（以一棵收入四两计），现可达七百万斤以上；若干地区在大麻子播种期间曾形成一个运动，绥远、察省、雁北、察北播种胡麻达一百万亩左右，太行播种大麻十一万亩，白麻九万亩。由于特种作物播种面积的扩大，各地并注意了种植多产代食作物，如冀东迁安，去年种甘薯二千七百五十亩，今年达四千五百五十亩，每亩可产二千斤，可代替五万人三个月的粮食。冀中文安、静海，察哈尔赤城等地则扩大稻地六千余亩。今年能排除万难完成播种，主要是由于各级领导上克服了开春以来对生产领导的自流现象，从四月份以来，各地均定生产工作为当前工作中心。当时旱象严重，为紧急动员抗旱抢种，发动群众与灾荒斗争，大批组织了工作队工作组，仅冀中即抽调干部一万四千余人，冀南抽调干部四千余人，深入区村具体领导，这对于及时掌握农情和具体解决问题作用很大。其次，在发动群众抗旱播种中，明确地树立人定胜天思想，打破靠天吃饭的侥幸心理。在有水车、水井、河道地区，组织群众浇水播种，并增修水车、水井、渠道以扩大耕地面积，冀南、冀中、冀东、察哈尔等地，即修旧水车七千九百三十五辆，增新水车八千七百四十六辆，打砖井五千六百七十六眼；冀中、察省等水利推进社，在抗旱播种中贷售水车三千四百二十余辆，冀东由商店、铁木工厂，亦贷出水车四百辆，冀中、冀鲁豫、太行、太岳等六个地区组织群众挖河开渠，增加水地六十万亩；在无水井水源地区，集中全力领导群众掘土井、挑水或拉水点种，冀中、冀东、察省、冀南等地不完全统计即打土井十二万眼以上，使一百余万亩棉花播种得以顺利完成。群众在抗旱中，创造了干地寄种、偷墒点种、棉花打畦育苗法等下种办法，因此克服了部分地区天旱不能下种的困难。再其次是将男女老少的劳动力一齐组织起来，克服了抗旱点种中劳力的困难。冀东乐亭、滦县、昌黎三县在抗旱抢种中，即组织一万零二百八十四个互助组，乐亭等七个县二十四个区，有八万一千一百三十六名妇女参加播种。冀南振堂县阴阳里村村干部、党员三十三人，带头组织四十四个互助组，男子挖井担水，妇女儿童挖坑点种，做到了及时抢种。冀中河间县龙华店村张瑞丰组八个人（青壮年妇女六、老头老婆各一），年青的挑水，年老的挖坑点种，种棉三十九亩。向无参加农业劳动习惯的冀东迁安县山地妇女，今年在“劳动光荣”、“人定胜天”的号召下，也有一万八千余人参加了播种。最后是去年秋耕成绩好，也给春耕播种打下了很好的基础，各地经验证明，凡是去年秋耕的土地，今春稍旱，也可播种出苗，否则播种即遭困难。加诸今年春耕准备比较充分，各地修补农具、购买牲口、兴修水利，动手较早，二、三月间即已完成送粪犁地，政府为扶助农业生产发放贷粮一千二百三十九万斤，八百万斤救济粮及大批贷款，结合贸易公司、商店、生产推进社、合作社等通过经营供销，以解决农民生产中的实际困难，对今年抗旱抢种也起了很大作用。
