Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 25th. Polish News Agency reports: The Secretariat of the Austrian Communist Party issued a statement on the 23rd, welcoming the agreement reached at the Paris Foreign Ministers' Conference on the Austrian issue; and emphasized that this was primarily due to the continuous efforts of the Soviet Union. The statement believes that the Austrian working masses have now opened a path towards a truly free and independent Austria, while the unilateral decisions of Western countries have harmed the social and economic development of Austria. Austria needs to establish friendly relations with the Soviet Union and neighboring countries. The statement concludes that the current coalition government has proven unable to meet the most basic demands of the Austrian people; the upcoming elections for government reorganization will be of decisive importance.

    【新华社北平二十五日电】波兰通讯社报道：奥地利共产党书记处于二十三日发表声明，欢迎巴黎外长会议在奥国问题上达成的协议；并且着重指出，这首先是由于苏联不断努力的结果。声明认为：奥国劳动群众现在已打开了一条走向真正自由与独立的奥地利的道路，而西方国家片面的决定，曾经危害了奥地利社会与经济的发展。奥地利需要与苏联和各邻国建立友好关系。声明末称，现在的联合政府，业已证明不能满足奥地利人民最基本的要求；即将到来的政府改组的选举，将具有决定的重要性。
