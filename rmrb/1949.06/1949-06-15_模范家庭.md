Model Family
	Chang Hai
	In "Production First Model Village" – Huangtuling, District One, Chicheng, there is a model family, that is, the home of "Old Commander" and "Old Model."
	Everyone in the village, old and young, male and female, is familiar with this model family. When they are mentioned, they are praised. They live in the southwest corner of the village, in a house with three rooms, facing south. The roof has been freshly plastered with mud. Upon entering the house, the first thing you see is the certificate of the Second-Class Labor Hero awarded to "Old Model" by the Chicheng County Government, hanging on the wall. In the west half of the house, there is a millstone. In the corner, there are farm tools such as sickles, hoes, and axes. On the kang, there is a large white hen hatching chicks. Although the furnishings in the house are not as "orderly" as in the city, they are neat and tidy, making people immediately think: "This family must be very diligent and thrifty!"
	"Old Commander's" name is Zhang Dalin, an old man around fifty years old. Originally from Dashitougou, Xiajia Village, he moved to Huangtuling eight or nine years ago to make a living. His father spent his life cutting firewood and burning charcoal. He herded cattle for others from the age of ten until he was nineteen, and then learned the craft of making noodles for seven years. After that, he rented more than ten mu of land from the landlord to grow potatoes and make noodles to make a living, so the villagers called him "Old Noodle Maker." For most of his life, he struggled to survive in hunger and cold. It was only after the Communist Party came that he turned over. During the land reform, he served as the head of the Poor Peasants' Association, actively leading the peasants to turn the tables. He himself received sixteen mu and six fen of land and eight rooms. There are three reasons why people call him "Old Commander": Firstly, because he was the head of the Poor Peasants' Association, was old, and used to be a famous "Old Noodle Maker," calling him "Old Commander" just felt natural. Secondly, because they have a long history. When they lived in Dashitougou in their hometown, they often dealt with the Eighth Route Army fighting the Japanese devils, and their family had even housed wounded soldiers of the Eighth Route Army. In Huangtuling, he was the first to see the Eighth Route Army. Thirdly, because he has a good temper, treats people kindly, and is like an elder treating his children. Because of these reasons, the name "Old Commander" stuck, and few people called him Zhang Dalin.
	"Old Model" is the wife of "Old Commander," named Zhang Baozhen. Originally from Xigou, Sihai, she came to Dayugou, Chicheng with her parents to escape famine at the age of three. Her hometown, Dashitougou, and "Old Commander's" hometown were separated by a ridge. The elders of the two families met on the hillside while grazing livestock. They were both poor brothers suffering, and their conversation became closer and closer, so they arranged a marriage for them. Because the family was poor, "Old Model" had been trained to be a skilled producer since she was a child. After marrying "Old Commander," she was mainly responsible for grinding noodles (because "Old Commander's" eyesight was not good). Every day, she got up at five in the morning and didn't sleep until late at night. There are also three reasons why she is called "Old Model": The first is that she was selected as the second labor model in the county at the Chicheng County Labor Model Conference in March this year. At first, the villagers called her "Labor Model." "Labor" and "Old" are homophones, so later they called her "Old Model." The second is that she has been a labor expert since she was a child, not just today. She can be called an old hand in the labor business. The third is because she is also relatively old.
	"Old Commander" and "Old Model" are not only a happy couple united by suffering, but also revolutionary companions, comrades, and glorious Communist Party members. When these are mentioned, a smile can't help but appear on "Old Commander's" face. The Communist Party rescued him from poverty, giving him a house, land, and political status. And he himself joined the Communist Party. What a joyous thing this is!
	In addition to "Old Commander" and "Old Model," there is also a "Young Commander" in the model family. This is "Old Commander's" son, Zhang Hai, who is the head of the Children's Corps. He is very capable at chopping firewood and doing other work. A teenager can chop sixty or seventy catties of firewood a day, and also goes to the fields with his mother to carry water and plant crops, so they call him "Young Commander."
	The model family sets an example in everything. Production goes without saying is the best in the village, and "Old Commander" also leads "Young Commander" and his group of children to work and cultivate land for the dependents of soldiers and the widowed who have no labor power. "Old Model" also leads the women in the village to collect firewood and work in the fields. As a result, the prize banner of "Production First Model Village" made by the district was first raised at the entrance of Huangtuling Village.

　　模范家庭
    长海
    “生产第一模范村”——赤城一区黄土岭，有一个模范家庭，那就是“老团长”和“老模范”他们的家。
    村里不论大人小孩，男的女的，对于这个模范家庭都很熟悉，一提起来，都满口称赞。他们住在村西南角，房子共是三间，座北朝南，房顶是新用泥抹过的。进入屋子，首先看到的便是挂在当墙的赤城县府奖给“老模范”的那张二等劳动英雄奖状；屋子西半截按着一盘粉磨；墙角堆放着镰刀、镐、斧等家具；炕头上还有一只大白母鸡正在孵着小鸡。屋子的陈设虽不如城市里那么“规矩”，倒也收拾得干净俐落，使人一看就会联想到：“这家人家一定挺勤俭！”
    “老团长”的名字叫张大林，是一个五十上下的老汉。原籍是夏家村大石头沟的人，为了谋生活，于八、九年前搬来黄土岭住。父亲割柴烧炭苦了一辈子，他十岁上就给人家放牛，放到十九岁，又学了七年做粉的手艺，以后就靠租地主十几亩地种山药蛋自己做粉过日子，所以村中人都管他叫“老粉匠”，多半辈子了，也老是在饥寒交迫中挣扎着过活。共产党来了，他才翻了身。土地改革中他当贫农团长，积极领导着农民闹翻身，他自己也得了十六亩六分地八间房。人们叫他“老团长”有三个原因：一是因为他是贫农团长，年岁又大，而且过去就是有名的“老粉匠”，现在叫他“老团长”一叫就挺顺嘴。二是因为他们争历史长，在老家大石头沟住时就长和打日本鬼子的八路军打交道，并且他们家还住过八路军的伤员，在黄土岭来说他是第一个最早见到八路军的。三是因为他脾气好，待人和气，真象老人对待儿女似的。因为这几个原因，他的“老团长”的名字便叫开了，很少听到有人叫他张大林。
    “老模范”是“老团长”的老伴，名叫张保珍，原籍是四海西沟人，三岁上随父母逃荒来到赤城大榆沟，和“老团长”的老家大石头沟隔一道垠，他们两家的老人在山坡上放牲口碰到了一块，都是受苦的穷哥们，拉起话来越拉越近乎，于是就给他们俩订了亲。因为家里穷“老模范”从小就锻炼出来是个生产能手，嫁给“老团长”以后，俩口子磨粉多凭她一人支掌（因“老团长”眼力不好），每天都是五更起，三星偏西才睡，她之所以被人们称呼为“老模范”，也有三个原因：第一个是今年三月赤城县召开劳模会时，她被选为全县的第二名劳动模范，开始时村里人都叫她“劳模”，“劳”“老”同音，所以以后就管她叫“老模范”。第二个是因为她从小就是劳动能手，不光这一天了，对劳动这一行她可以称得起是老把式。第三个就是因为她的年岁也比较老一些。
    “老团长”和“老模范”不但是受苦人结合的一对美满夫妻，而且他们还是革命的伴侣，是同志，是光荣的共产党员，一提起这些，“老团长”脸上就会情不自禁的流露出笑容。共产党把他从穷困中救了出来，使得他有了房子有了地也有了政治地位。而他自己也参加了共产党，这该是多么喜悦的事情！
    模范家庭里除了“老团长”“老模范”而外，还有一个“少团长”，这就是“老团长”他儿子张海，是儿童团长，打柴干活数他能干，十几岁的孩子一天就打六七十斤柴火，还和他母亲一块下地挑水点种庄稼，所以都叫他“少团长”。
    模范家庭里处处都做模范，生产不用说在全村数第一，而且“老团长”还领上“少团长”他们这一伙孩子们去给无劳力的军属孤寡干活种地。“老模范”也带动起全村劳动妇女们去打柴、干地里活，于是，区里做的那面“生产第一模范村”的奖旗，便首先在黄土岭村口上飘扬起来。
