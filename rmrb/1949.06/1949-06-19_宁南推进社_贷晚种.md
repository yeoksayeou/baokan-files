[Jinan Telegram] The Ningnan Production Promotion Cooperative is lending and selling wheat stubble late-season seeds to meet the needs of farmers in disaster areas. On May 28th, the cooperative decided to clear up various old loans, first recovering grain loans from villages with better wheat harvests, and selling the cooperative's existing coarse grains to purchase 70,000 catties of wheat stalk late-season seeds such as millet and beans, and lending them to the first, third, and fourth districts, where the spring famine is more severe, to solve the problem of late-crop seed shortages in rural areas. To help farmers fight drought, it is planned to rush-manufacture 30 sets of five-wheel waterwheels to lend or sell to farmers. In addition, in order to cooperate with conservation and change farmers' wasteful habits after wheat harvest, it has been decided to sell off coarse grains in exchange for wheat.

    【冀南电】宁南生产推进社贷、卖麦茬晚种，以应灾区农民需要。五月二十八日，该社决定清理各种旧贷，先收回麦收较好村庄的贷粮，连同社现存粗粮出售，收买麦荐晚种如谷子、豆类等七万斤，分别贷给春荒较重的一、三、四区，解决农村晚苗种籽困难。为扶助农民抗旱，计划赶制五轮水车三十挂，贷或卖给农民。此外为配合节约，改变农民麦后浪费习惯，决定将粗粮抛售，换回麦子。
