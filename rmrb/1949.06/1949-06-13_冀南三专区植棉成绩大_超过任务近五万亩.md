[Jinnan News] Since the Jinnan Third Special District began a concentrated cotton planting campaign on April 24th, it has victoriously concluded by May 25th. According to district-wide statistics, a total of 897,129 mu of cotton were planted, exceeding the original plan (850,000 mu) by more than 47,000 mu. The achievement is mainly due to strong leadership. On April 20th (Grain Rain), the prefectural committee promptly grasped the planting season and notified all counties to launch a concentrated cotton planting movement. Within a week of the campaign, the counties had reached 60% of their original plan. Subsequently, rainfall in parts of Handan, Linzhang, and Chengci further intensified the enthusiasm for accelerated planting. After the rain, Handan rushed to plant over 600 hectares of cotton, completing two-thirds of its task. The day before the district party committee issued an emergency mobilization order, the prefectural committee, in order to resolutely complete the task, further instructed all counties: "This is a serious political task given to us by the Party. It is not something that can be completed or not completed. It is not a matter of 'doing our best', but a matter of must be completed and guaranteed completion." Such a clear affirmation of the task greatly enhanced the determination and confidence of the counties. After the instructions were issued, the prefectural committee dispatched 480 cadres to the counties to assist in the concentrated campaign. Leading cadres at all levels personally went deep into the districts and villages to work. In this intense campaign, telephone contact was continuous day and night, and messengers raced day and night to exchange experiences and commend model workers, resulting in a widespread and vibrant cotton planting movement. Thanks to the efforts of cadres and the masses over the past month, the plan was finally exceeded. This campaign not only completed and exceeded the task but also laid the foundation for cadres, party members, and the masses to further develop the great production movement in the future.

　　冀南三专区植棉成绩大
  　超过任务近五万亩
    【冀南讯】冀南三专区，自四月二十四日全区开始发动突击种棉以来，至五月二十五日已胜利结束，全区统计共种棉八十九万七千一百二十九亩，超过原计划（八十五万亩）四万七千余亩。成绩的获得，主要由于领导的有力。四月二十日（谷雨），地委即及时掌握种植季节，通知各县发动突击种棉运动。各县突击一周就达到原计划的百分之六十，中间邯郸、临漳、成磁部分地区落了三指雨，更增加了抢种热潮的展开，邯郸雨后就抢种棉花六百余顷完成任务三分之二。在区党委紧急动员令前一天，地委为了坚决完成任务，再指示各县：“这是党给我们的严重的政治任务、不能可完成可不完成，不是‘尽力而为’，而是必须完成、保证完成”。这样明确肯定了任务，大大的提高了各县的决心和信心。指示发出后，地委又于当日抽调四百八十名干部到县帮助突击，各级领导干部都亲自深入到区村工作。在这种紧张突击工作中，电话联系日夜不停，通信员为及时交流经验表扬模范，日夜奔跑，热火朝天的植棉运动普遍展开。一个月来由于干部群众的努力，终于超过了计划。这次突击，不仅完成并超过了任务。而且打下了今后干部党员和群众进一步开展大生产运动的基础。
