    Comrade Fu Lianzhang, the current Deputy Minister of Health of the Military Commission of the People's Liberation Army, gave this talk twelve years ago. At that time, he was not yet a member of the Communist Party. This talk not only narrates his personal history of moving from an old intellectual to a revolutionary, but also reflects the real situation of the Red Army's health work at that time, as well as the cooperation between the Communist Party and non-Party人士. This talk still has practical significance at present because it illustrates the following two points. First, it shows that: although there are distinct differences in the method of thinking and in the social origins of thought between Christianity—and the doctrines of any other religion—and communist thought, the Communist Party sincerely cooperates with all non-Party人士 in the common action of anti-imperialism, anti-feudalism, and anti-bureaucratic capitalism, and in the common action of serving the people with their production skills (including all scientific and technological departments and production departments), regardless of religious beliefs. The Communist Party's policy has been and still is the same. Second, it shows that: it is a huge transformation and a huge progress for a religious believer to move from serving the people with his production skills to believing in communism ideologically. In the people's army under the leadership of the proletariat, under the people's regime under the leadership of the proletariat, and under the education of Marxism-Leninism-Mao Zedong Thought, this transformation and this progress are possible for any member of the people's ranks—as long as he himself strives for this transformation.
    This talk was published in the "National Salvation Times" published in France in May 1937, and later printed as a booklet. At that time, in the territory of China, the people's regime was limited to some areas. In the Kuomintang-controlled areas, to find sincere readers of this article, it was first necessary to break through the dense screen of rumor-mongers and deceivers. Today, with the imminent demise of the reactionary rule, rumor-mongers and deceivers have long lost their market. People have recognized the truth of the revolution from undeniable facts, and on the other hand, they have discovered that those rumor-mongers and deceivers are precisely the reactionary rule itself. Reading this "old talk" will further enhance this understanding.

### 傅连＠医师抗战前对记者的谈话

    傅连＠医师抗战前对记者的谈话
    这是现在的解放军军委卫生部副部长傅连＠同志在十二年前的一篇谈话。当时他还不是共产党员。这篇谈话不仅叙述了他个人从一个旧的知识分子走向革命的历史，而且反映了当时红军卫生工作的真实情况，以及共产党与党外人士合作的情况。由于这篇谈话说明了以下两个问题，所以他在目前还保有现实的意义。第一、它说明了：虽然在思想方法上，在思想的社会根源上，基督教——而且任何其他宗教的教义与共产主义思想之间，有着截然的不同，但是在反帝反封建反官僚资本主义的共同行动上，在以其生产技能（包括一切科学技术部门生产部门）为人民服务的共同行动上，共产党人则不分宗教信仰诚恳地与一切党外人士合作。共产党的这一政策，过去是如此，现在仍是如此。第二，它说明了：一个宗教信仰者经过了以其生产技能为人民服务的行动，走到从思想上信仰共产主义，这是一个巨大的转变，巨大的进步，在无产阶级领导的人民军队里，在无产阶级领导的人民政权下，在马列主义毛泽东思想的教育下，这一转变，这一进步，对于人民行列里任何一分子——只要他自己努力于这一转变，都是可能的。
    这篇谈话曾于一九三七年五月登载于在法国出版的救国时报，后来又印为小册子发行，当时，在中国的国土上，人民的政权还只限于部份区域，在国民党统治区，这篇文章要找到诚恳的读者，就首先必须冲破造谣欺骗者的密幕，而在今天，随着反动统治的将近灭亡，造谣欺骗者早已失掉其市场，人们已经从无可争辩的事实中认识到革命的真实情况，另一方面也就发觉了那些造谣欺骗者正是反动统治的本身，读了这一篇“旧话”，将会更加增强这一认识的。
