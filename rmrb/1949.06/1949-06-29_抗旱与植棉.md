On Drought Resistance and Cotton Planting
    By Zhang Chong, Deputy Minister of Agriculture, North China People's Government

　　Sowing in the entire North China region has been basically completed. This was carried out in the midst of a full-scale struggle against drought, as well as pests, wind, hail, frost, and other disasters. The sowing of field crops was more than 90% complete by the end of May. In areas where rainfall was late or affected by hail and frost, intensive replanting and supplementary planting is underway. In particular, the cotton planting season coincided with a widespread drought across the region, and farmers used every possible method to overcome difficulties. Currently, 12 million mu have been sown, accounting for more than 92% of the original plan of 13 million mu. According to incomplete statistics, peanut sowing has reached more than 4 million mu, and hemp planting has exceeded the original plan. The greatness of the farmers' fighting strength has surprised many.

　　From Grain Rain to Grain Full, which is the season for planting cotton and sowing major autumn crops, North China experienced a lack of rain, presenting a serious drought situation. We convened agricultural and water conservancy experts in Beijing and Tianjin several times, and proposed many ways to overcome the drought, including long-term afforestation and water conservancy projects, as well as immediate emergency measures. However, some people believed that the measures would not be very effective. At that time, we adopted positive measures that could be taken immediately, combined with past experiences in fighting drought, to lead farmers in overcoming the threat of drought and achieving victory in the struggle for drought-resistant planting. Especially the struggle for cotton planting. When we first arrived in Beiping, some cotton industry and textile technicians, seeing the plan to plant 12 million mu of cotton (the original plan lacked 1 million mu in eastern Hebei), believed that it was absolutely impossible. The cotton planting season also coincided with drought, and more people worried that the cotton planting plan would fall through. However, the power of the masses is great. According to current reports, 12 million mu of cotton have been planted, and a large portion of it was spot-planted with water carried before the rain. For example, in central Hebei, which has more than 3 million mu, more than half was spot-planted; in Laiyuan, Zhuozhou, and Yi County, 80% was spot-planted.

　　The victory of this struggle not only laid the foundation for the autumn harvest, but also influenced the stability and decline of grain and commodity prices. The 12 million mu of cotton will produce 300 million jin of ginned cotton, two-thirds of which will be enough for the vast rural areas and all the yarn factories in North China, and about one-third can be supplied to yarn factories in Shanghai and the Northeast.

　　The reason for the victory of this struggle is the determination of our party and government cadres at all levels to serve the people and the fighting spirit of the vast number of farmers to overcome difficulties. The main experiences are: First, the leadership grasped the situation tightly. In early spring, local areas were overburdened by tasks such as supporting the war, and leadership over production was left to drift. However, when a serious drought was discovered in mid-April, the focus quickly shifted to leading production. The North China Bureau of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the North China People's Government repeatedly issued calls and instructions, proposing specific methods for drought-resistant planting. Our party and government organs at all levels, with the spirit of wholeheartedly serving the masses, led the masses in drought-resistant planting. For example, the central Hebei region transferred more than 14,000 cadres, and southern Hebei transferred more than 4,000 cadres to go deep into the countryside, which made it possible to achieve almost unbelievable results under extremely difficult drought and various disasters.

　　Second, we educated farmers to overcome the fluke mentality of relying on heaven for rain, establish the fighting will of "man will conquer nature," and use various methods and technologies based on local conditions and past experience to overcome the serious difficulties brought to us by the drought. We promoted effective methods such as carrying water for spot-planting, planting in dry soil, stealing moisture for spot-planting, and ridge seedling cultivation for cotton. The central issue in drought resistance is to develop water conservancy. In areas with wells, well water was used around the clock. In areas with canals, canal management was improved to expand the irrigation area. For example, the Fuyang River expanded the irrigation area by more than 30,000 mu. Where conditions for developing water conservancy existed, water conservancy was vigorously developed. According to incomplete statistics in May, more than 800,000 mu of paddy fields were added by opening canals, and the Shijiazhuang-Jinan irrigation canal can irrigate 200,000 mu. In central and southern Hebei and Chahar, more than 8,000 waterwheels were repaired and more than 9,000 new waterwheels were added. In the vast plains, the most timely solution was to dig earthen wells. At that time, some people thought that there were not many places where earthen wells could be dug, or that they were labor-intensive, not timely, or not effective. In fact, more than 140,000 earthen wells have been dug this year in drought resistance, which can ensure that about 2 million mu of land is planted in time (each earthen well requires five or six laborers, or up to ten, to ensure that ten to fifteen mu are planted).

　　Third, drought-resistant planting is an extremely arduous project. In particular, digging wells, opening canals, and carrying water for spot-planting are very labor-intensive. The masses urgently need to organize themselves and use labor cooperation, with men and women, old and young, working together to overcome the labor shortage. For example, in the three counties of Leting, Luanxian, and Changli in eastern Hebei, more than 10,000 mutual aid teams (10,284 teams) were organized during drought-resistant planting. In the 27 districts of the seven counties of Leting, more than 80,000 women participated in planting. In Yin Yangli Village, Zhentang, southern Hebei, 33 village cadres and party members took the lead in organizing 44 mutual aid teams, dividing labor according to labor power. Men dug wells and carried water, and women and children dug holes for spot-planting, quickly completing planting. In Zhang Ruifeng's team in Hejian, central Hebei, six young and middle-aged women, an old man, and an old woman, with the young and middle-aged women carrying water and the old man and old woman digging holes for spot-planting, planted 39 mu of cotton. In the drought-resistant planting, it has been fully proved that before we have certain advanced tools and equipment, organization has the greatest power.

　　We must not be complacent because of this. We must realize that in completing this great task, individual regions have experienced administrative commandism and formalism. We should now work hard to correct this. At the same time, although we have completed the first step of the plan—sowing—planting does not equal harvest. We must continue to carry out arduous struggles. First, timely hoeing and seedling protection are essential to prevent crops from becoming overgrown. "Hoeing seedlings an inch is better than fertilizing," and "The hoe has both water and fire, preventing drought and waterlogging." These are the valuable experiences of farmers. At the same time, top dressing should be increased as much as possible to increase yields. Second, current statistics show that more than 100 counties have experienced insect pests, and some have already suffered losses. Strict organizational work must be carried out, and the masses must be mobilized and organized to use all effective local methods and, to the extent possible, further use existing scientific and technological conditions to eliminate pests in a timely manner. "Protecting seedlings is like protecting life, and eliminating insects is like fighting fire." Pests must be eliminated wherever they occur. Third, the rainy season is approaching. We must learn from the painful experience of last year, when there was drought followed by flooding. We must inspect and repair dikes, fully prepare materials and equipment, and when the flood season arrives, local leaders should personally go to the dikes to ensure that the hard-won results of drought-resistant spot-planting are not lost. At the same time, mountainous areas should use mountain floods as much as possible to create silted beaches. This can not only improve the soil and increase fertilizer, but also reduce the harm of downstream floods. Finally, in a few places, there has still been no thorough rain, and drought-resistant spot-planting must be carried out more actively. There are also a few areas where self-reliance has been allowed and planting has not been fully completed. Thorough inspections must be carried out to ensure planting, and efforts must be made to investigate and eliminate wasteland. Land that can be planted should be planted as much as possible, even if it is planted with pasture or trees. There are also some places where planting has been completed, but it was done under coercion. It should be repeatedly explained to the farmers that this planting is not only an important achievement of the entire economic construction plan, but also in the best interests of the farmers themselves. In short, we must conduct thorough inspections, overcome shortcomings, continue to carry forward the spirit and perseverance of drought-resistant spot-planting, cultivate meticulously, eliminate pests, prevent floods, and ensure this year's harvest.

　　抗旱与植棉
    华北人民政府农业部副部长  张冲
    华北全区的播种已经基本上完成，这是在全力向旱灾以及虫害、风雹霜冻等灾害的斗争中进行的。大田作物播种，至五月底已完成百分之九十以上。落雨较迟或受雹冻等灾地区，正突击改种补种中。特别是棉花播种季节正处于全区普遍干旱，而农民用尽一切办法克服困难，目前已播种一千二百万亩，占原计划一千三百万亩的百分之九十二以上。花生播种据不完全统计，已达到四百余万亩，大麻子占种已超过原计划。农民斗争力量的伟大，使许多人感到惊奇。
    谷雨至小满正当植棉与大秋作物播种季节，华北各地缺雨，呈严重旱象，我们曾召集平津农业水利专家研究数次，提出了许多克服天旱的办法，有长期的造林兴修水利办法，也有目前救急的办法；但也有的人认为办法效果不大。当时我们采取了目前可能作到的积极办法，结合过去与旱灾的斗争经验，领导农民克服天旱不雨的威胁，取得了抗旱播种斗争的胜利。尤其是植棉的斗争，当我们初到北平，曾有棉业纺织技术人员看到植棉一千二百万亩的计划（原计划缺冀东一百万亩），就认为决不可能，棉花播种季节又适逢天旱，更多的人耽心植棉计划行将落空。但是群众力量是伟大的，目前接到的报告，已植棉一千二百万亩，而很大的部分是在雨前担水点种的。如冀中三百余万亩，一半以上是点种的；涞涿、易县百分之八十是点种的。
    这一斗争的胜利，不但打下了秋收的基础，也影响了粮价物价的平稳与下降。一千二百万亩的棉花将能产三万万斤皮棉，其中三分之二即足够广大农村及华北所有纱厂之用，尚有三分之一左右可供给上海、东北纱厂。
    这一斗争胜利的原因，是由于我各级党政干部为人民服务的决心与广大农民克服困难的斗争毅力。主要的经验是：第一、领导上抓的紧，春初各地因为支援战争等任务太重，对生产领导自流，但四月中旬发现严重的旱象，立即迅速的转入以领导生产为中心。中共中央华北局及华北人民政府一再发出号召指示，提出具体抗旱播种的办法，我们各级党政机关更以全心全力为群众服务的精神，领导群众抗旱播种。如冀中区即抽调一万四千多干部，冀南即四千余干部深入农村，才能在极端困难的天旱与各种灾害的情况下，作出令人几乎难以相信的成绩。
    第二、教育农民克服靠天等雨的侥幸心理，树立人定胜天的斗争意志，根据各地条件与过去经验运用各种办法与技术，克服天旱给我们的严重困难，提倡担水点种、干地寄种、偷墒点种、棉花打畦育苗等有效办法。在抗旱中的中心问题是开展水利，有井地方很多昼夜不停的使用井水，有渠的地方改善渠道管道管理，扩大浇地面积，如滏阳河即扩大浇地三万亩以上。有开展水利条件的地方大力兴修水利，据五月份不完全统计，开渠增水田八十余万亩，石津灌溉渠即可浇地二十万亩。冀中、冀南、察哈尔修水车八千余辆，增新水车九千余辆。而在广大平原地区解决问题最及时的是打土井，当时曾有些人以为能打土井条件的地方不多或费工、不及时、不顶事，实际今年抗旱中已打土井十四余万眼，即可保证二百万亩左右的地及时下种（每眼土井用工五六个多至十来个即可保证十至十五亩下种）。
    第三、抗旱播种是一件极其艰巨的工程，特别是打井开渠担水点种费劳力很大，群众迫切要组织起来用劳动互助，男女老少齐下手的办法，克服劳动力的困难。如冀东乐亭、滦县、昌黎三县群众，抗旱播种中即组织了一万多（１０２８４组）互助组，乐亭等七县二十七个区即有八万余妇女参加播种，冀南振堂阴杨里村村干部党员三十三人带头，组织四十四个互助组，按劳力分工，男子挖井担水，妇女儿童挖坑点种，很快下种。冀中河间张瑞丰组六个青壮年妇女、一个老头、一个老婆，青壮年妇女挑水，老头老婆挖坑点种，植棉三十九亩。在抗旱播种中，充分的证明了当我们还没有一定的进步工具与设备前，组织起来具有最伟大的力量。
    我们决不能因此自满，必须认识到在完成这一伟大任务中，个别地区曾经发生了行政命令形式主义的作风，现在应当努力改正，同时，我们虽然完成了计划的第一步——播种，但种上并不等于收成，还必须继续进行艰巨的斗争。第一、及时锄苗保苗，不使禾苗荒芜，“苗锄一寸顶上粪”，“锄头上有水又有火，防旱又防涝”，这是农民的宝贵经验。同时尽可能的增上追肥，才能增加收成。第二、目前统计已有百余县发生虫害，有的已经受到损失，必须进行严密的组织工作，动员与组织群众，运用一切有效的土办法并在可能范围内进一步运用现有的科学技术条件及时扑灭。“保苗如保命，灭虫如救火”，必须哪裹发生消灭在哪里。第三、雨季即至，必须接受去年先旱后涝的惨痛经验，检查与增修堤防，充分准备物料器材，汛期一至，当地领导干部应亲自上堤，保障不使抗旱点种辛苦的成果付诸东流。同时山地尽可能的利用山洪，放淤成滩。不但能改良土壤，增加肥料，而且减轻下流的洪水为患。最后有少数地方至今未见透雨，必须更积极的进行抗旱点种。还有少数地区放任自流没完全种上，必须深入检查，保证下种，并进行查荒灭荒，能种的地尽可能种上，即使种牧草植树都是好的。还有些地方虽然种上，但是在强迫命令下完成的，应当向农民一再讲清，这次播种不只是全部经济建设计划的重要成就，也正是农民最切身的利益。总之，要深入检查，克服缺点，继续发扬抗旱点种的精神与毅力，精耕细作，除虫害，防水患，保证今年的收成。
