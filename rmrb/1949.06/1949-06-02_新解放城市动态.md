Xinhua News Agency, Hankou, 1st. Wuhan allocates funds for repairing dikes and controlling floods.
　　Wuhan has been experiencing continuous rain, and the water level of the Yangtze River has been rising. As of the 29th, it had reached 22.67 meters, which is 5.61 meters lower than the water level on the same day in 1931, when a major flood occurred. When the Kuomintang bandit gang ruled Wuhan, they neither repaired the Yangtze River channel nor did they destroy dikes everywhere. For example, the famous Zhang Gong Dike was destroyed in six places by the bandit army. The transportation trenches dug were all more than one meter wide and more than two meters deep, and some were as long as two or three hundred meters. If they are not repaired as soon as possible, a major flood may occur. The Wuhan Military Control Commission and the Wuhan People's Government have decided to allocate funds for repairing dikes and controlling floods in order to ensure the safety of the people. On one hand, water pumps are being used to drain the Xiang River water into the lower reaches of the Yangtze River, and on the other hand, the dikes are being repaired. The surveying and cost estimation work has been completed, the materials have been prepared, and the civil workers have also been mobilized by the municipal government. The water control project can begin immediately.
　　Hanyang
　　Xinhua News Agency, Hankou, 1st. After the liberation of Hanyang, social order in the city was quickly restored. Water transportation to and from Wuchang and Hankou and external telephone communications have been uninterrupted. Most factories and schools have resumed work and classes. Except for the Hubei Provincial Refinery, the Central China Paper Mill, the Wufeng Flour Mill, and the Ordnance Factory, which had stopped production due to lack of raw materials, other public and private factories are operating as usual. All higher and secondary schools have persisted in not suspending classes. Workers, staff, and students of various factories and schools warmly welcome the People's Liberation Army and are vying to tell the People's Liberation Army about their heroic struggles to protect factories and schools. Workers at the Wufeng Flour Mill secretly organized a factory protection team a month ago and fought against the Kuomintang remnants to protect the factory. Teachers and students from various secondary schools in Hanyang also organized guard units before liberation. At the most tense time, teachers and students took turns guarding day and night to protect the school. Now all the schools are intact.
　　Wuchang
　　Xinhua News Agency, Hankou, 1st. The Political Department of the People's Liberation Army Garrison in Wuchang held a joint celebration party with workers from various factories in Wuchang at the auditorium of Central China University in Wuchang on the evening of May 25th. Attendees included workers from seven units, including the South Hubei Electric Power Company, Hankou No. 1 Cotton Mill, and the 30th Ordnance Factory, as well as a part of the commanders and fighters of the department. At the meeting, the propaganda team of the department performed dramas such as "Catching Conscripts" and "The Kuomintang is a Mess," as well as songs. The workers were extremely excited.
　　Wuhan University Officially Resumes Classes
　　Xinhua News Agency, Hankou, 1st. Wuhan University officially resumed classes on May 26th. The school is located at the foot of Luojia Mountain, with magnificent buildings, more than 100,000 books, relatively complete scientific instruments, and a practice factory. When the White bandits fled, they planned to destroy it, but thanks to the active protection of all teachers and students, the school's equipment was well preserved. The school's student union is actively preparing for the "June 1st" memorial meeting to commemorate the three students who were shot and killed by the Kuomintang bandit gang two years ago during the anti-civil war movement. In order to welcome the People's Liberation Army into the city, the students of the school conducted extensive street propaganda and invited a division of the People's Liberation Army to hold a celebration party in the school's stadium. At the party, the student representatives who spoke said that Wuhan University students will study hard, dedicate all their strength, and unite with the people to serve the people honestly.
　　Nanchang
　　Xinhua News Agency, Nanchang, 1st. Nanchang workers bravely protect machines and prevent the Kuomintang bandit army from destroying them. The Nanchang Pseudo-Garrison Command entered the Hydropower Company three times before retreating, attempting to destroy the water supply room and power generation room, but the bandits were eventually forced to withdraw under the protection of all employees. Afterwards, the workers set up an electric fence around the company to prevent the enemy from invading, and finally the machines were preserved. When the enemy's Fifth Army fled south on the 21st, they went to the South Railway Station to force the workers to drive the trains. The workers heard about it in advance and immediately drove the four locomotives out of the station and dispersed them. They also disassembled the parts of several locomotives. When the bandit army wanted the trains, the workers simply said that the locomotives were broken and could not be driven. After receiving the "southward relocation" order from the Pseudo-8th Pacification Zone, the employees of the Nanchang Broadcasting Station disassembled important parts overnight and risked their lives to transport the six-ton machines to the outside of the city for preservation.

　　新解放城市动态
    武汉拨款　修堤治水
    【新华社汉口一日电】武汉连日阴雨，长江水位上涨，至二十九日已达二二·六七公尺，与曾酿成巨大水灾的民国二十年同日水位相较，低五·六一公尺。国民党匪帮在统治武汉时，既不修理长江水道，又到处破坏江堤。如著名的张公堤，就被匪军挖毁六处，其中所挖交通沟皆宽达一米多，深达二米，长则有的达二、三百米，如不及早修补，大泛到来可能酿成巨灾，武汉军管会和武汉人民政府为保障人民安全，业已决定拨款修堤治水，一面用抽水机把襄河河水排向长江下游，一面补修堤岸。现在测量、估工工作已全部完成，材料已准备停妥，民工也已由市府动员，治水工程即可开始。
　　汉阳
    【新华社汉口一日电】汉阳解放后，市内社会秩序迅速恢复，至武昌、汉口的水上交通和对外电话始终未断，工厂、学校绝大部分都已复工复课。公营工厂除湖北省立炼油厂、华中造纸厂、五丰面粉厂、兵工厂等因原料缺乏早已停工外，其他公私营工厂都照常开工。各高等中等学校则始终坚持未曾停课。各工厂学校职工、师生们均热烈欢迎解放军，争向解放军诉述他们英勇护厂护校的斗争经过。五丰面粉厂工人在一个月以前就秘密地组织了护厂队，曾与国民党溃匪斗争，斗争保护了工厂。汉阳各中等学校师生们在解放前也组织了警卫股。在情况最紧张时，师生们日夜轮流守卫，保护学校。现各校都完好无损。
　　武昌
    【新华社汉口一日电】人民解放军驻武昌警卫部队政治部，于五月二十五日晚，假武昌华中大学礼堂与武昌各工厂工人举行联欢晚会。到会者有鄂南电力公司、汉口第一纱厂、三十兵工厂等七单位工人及该部指战员一部。会上由该部宣传队演出“捉壮丁”、“国民党一团糟”等话剧及歌咏。工人情绪极为兴奋。
　　武汉大学正式复课
    【新华社汉口一日电】武汉大学已于五月二十六日正式复课。该校位于珞珈山麓，建筑宏丽，图书十万余册，科学仪器设置相当完备，并有实习工厂。白匪逃走时曾准备加以破坏，幸赖全校师生积极保护，校内设备得以完好保存。该校学生自治会正积极筹备“六一”纪念会，纪念二年前反内战运动中被国民党匪帮枪杀的三位同学。该校学生为欢迎人民解放军入城，曾进行了广泛的街头宣传工作，并邀请解放军某师在该校体育场举行庆祝解放联欢晚会。在晚会上讲话的学生代表表示：武大学生将努力学习，献出自己所有的力量，和人民结合起来，老老实实为人民服务。
    南昌
    【新华社南昌一日电】南昌工人英勇保护机器，阻止国民党匪军破坏。南昌伪警备司令部在溃退前曾三次进入水电公司，企图捣毁供水间和发电间，但在全体职工守护下匪军终被迫退出。以后工人们便在公司周围设立电网，防敌侵入，终使机器得以保全。二十一日敌第五军南逃时，曾到南车站强迫工人开车，事前工人闻讯，立即将四个机车开到站外分散，另外又把几个机车的机件拆卸了。当匪军要车时，工人干脆地说机车都是坏的，不能开动。南昌广播电台在接到伪第八绥区“南迁”命令后，职工们连夜把重要机件拆卸，并冒着危险将六吨重的机器运至市外保存。
