    [Report from this newspaper] After the Tianjin Municipal People's Government handed over 9,171 pieces of antiques and books it had taken over to the Cultural Relics Department of the North China Higher Education Committee, the Cultural Relics Department dispatched personnel to transport all of these antiques and books to Beiping on the 6th (previous), totaling 67 boxes. Among them are precious antiques such as ancient bronzes, Han Dynasty bell hooks, broken pottery, rubbings, and "Tang Dynasty Painted Lady Bricks."
