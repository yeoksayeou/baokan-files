　　Important Correction
    In yesterday's newspaper, on the first page, in the right-hand masthead, in the news item "Youth League Establishes Railway Workers' Committee," "贾义" (Jia Yi) should be "贾守义" (Jia Shouyi); in the short commentary, sixth line, "虽因秧种困难" (although due to difficulties in rice seedling planting) should be "种种困难" (all kinds of difficulties); and the report from the delegation of the Great Representatives should have the addition "Xinhua News Agency, Beiping, 3rd telegram." In the fourth section, fourth paragraph, third line of that report, "世界大战," (World War,) should be "世界大战中" (in World War). These are all hereby corrected.

　　重要更正
    昨日本报一版右报头“青年团设铁道工委会”消息中“贾义”应为“贾守义”；短论第六行“虽因秧种困难”应为“种种困难”；和大代表团报告书应补加“新华社北平三日电”，该报告书第四节第四段第三行“世界大战，”应为“世界大战中”，特此一并更正。
