    Changxindian Railway Machinery Plant Implements Craftsmanship Assessment System; Twenty-Two Apprentices Promoted to Journeymen
    [This Newspaper reports] The Changxindian Railway Machinery Plant, correctly implementing the craftsmanship assessment system, has promoted twenty-two apprentices to journeymen. During the Kuomintang's rule, some apprentices at the plant who had completed four or five years of apprenticeship and already possessed the qualifications of journeymen were neither tested nor promoted. Since liberation, the plant's leadership has listened to the workers' feedback and actively changed this situation. Starting in June, an examination committee was formed by the personnel, work, and technology sections, as well as the production committee of each workshop's trade union, to conduct examinations for apprentices who had been apprenticing for more than three years. The examination method, in addition to a simple written test (or oral test), mainly required each apprentice to perform one or two practical tasks according to their subject of study, and then the scores were evaluated based on the quality, the length of time required, and other aspects. All twenty-two workers promoted this time passed the examination. However, because their technical skills were not completely uniform, they were rated according to their previous wage standards: ten people with a base salary of 39 yuan, seven people with 34.5 yuan, and five people with 30 yuan. Re-examinations and re-evaluations were conducted for those who had objections, and everyone expressed satisfaction.

    长辛店铁路机厂实行考工制
    二十二名艺徒升为帮匠
    【本报讯】长辛店铁路机厂，正确实行考工制度，二十二名艺徒升为帮匠。该厂在国民党统治时期，若干艺徒学满四年五年，早已具备帮匠条件，但不加考试，也不提升。解放以来，该厂领导上听取了工人的反映，积极改变此种现象。从六月开始，由人事、工作、技术三科和各场工会生产委员，组成考试委员会，对满三年以上的艺徒进行考试。考试方法，除简单的笔试（或口试）外，主要按照艺徒所学的科目，每人实作一种或两种工作，然后根据质量的高低，所需时间的长短等方面，评定分数。此次提升的二十二名工友，均为考试合格者。但其中技术高低并不完全一致，因此依以往的工资标准评为：底薪三十九元的十人，三十四元五的七人，三十元的五人。对有意见的又进行了复试复评，大家表示满意。
