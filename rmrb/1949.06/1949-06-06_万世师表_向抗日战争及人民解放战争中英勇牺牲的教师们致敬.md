　　Teacher for All Ages
　　——A Tribute to the Teachers Who Sacrificed Heroically in the War of Resistance Against Japanese Aggression and the People's Liberation War
　　Zhao Huai
　　From Liyanzhuang, Third District of Xingtang, of peasant origin. He joined the Communist Party at the beginning of the War of Resistance and was responsible for propaganda and education work in the village branch. When the Japanese invaders advanced and encroached, a blockhouse was built in the village. He often shouted under the blockhouse, distributed leaflets, and wrote slogans. Later, when the village blockhouse was destroyed, although there were still two blockhouses three miles away, he restored the primary school and people's school, worked as a teacher, persevered in his work, and was elected as a model for the entire district.

　　In the winter of 1944, he was unfortunately captured and imprisoned in the enemy stronghold of Nanchengzhai with more than eighty fellow villagers from nearby villages. They were tied with ropes one by one, unable to sit or lie down, and were not allowed to eat or drink. Many people froze and starved to death. But Zhao still told the masses not to reveal anti-Japanese secrets. Later, the enemy asked each person to redeem himself with one hundred catties of millet. Not only was Zhao not released, but he was tied to a pillar and whipped with pig bristle ropes dipped in cold water. But the enemy only received angry scolding in return. Enraged, the enemy tied his hands and feet with iron wire and threw him into the livestock shed to be trampled by mules and horses. Comrade Zhao Huai died heroically in this way. It was not until we captured the Nanchengzhai stronghold that his body was dug out from the horse manure.

　　Ren Bin
　　A primary school teacher in Laohanping, Fanshi County, of peasant origin, simple and sincere. He only attended primary school for three years, but he was very capable in his work, mostly learning from practice.

　　Laohanping was very close to the enemy's stronghold, and the enemy often came to harass. In order to carry out work here, the district office decided to transfer him there. After returning to the village, he first started with cultural and recreational activities to mobilize children and tried his best to meet the needs of the masses. This led to the enrollment of all twenty-odd school-age children in the village.

　　In order to facilitate his work, he also joined the guerrilla squad and often went to attack the enemy. At dawn on February 11, 1945, the enemy surrounded Laohanping and searched houses one by one. Comrade Ren Bin was still sleeping when the enemy suddenly rushed in. He didn't even have time to hide the newspapers and textbooks on the table. Knowing that he could not hide, he picked up a firewood axe from the ground and fought the Japanese devils in hand-to-hand combat. Then four enemies came in, but he did not show any weakness, jumping up and down, fighting the enemy, chopping off one enemy's leg and smashing another enemy's spine. The remaining enemies were also beaten and injured all over. Finally, because the enemy was too numerous and the disparity in strength was too great, he was shot down by the enemy's bullets.

　　Guo Guixiang
　　A female teacher at Subao Village Primary School in Hongdong County. In the autumn of 1946, the Chiang Kai-shek bandit army occupied Subao Village. On October 21, Comrade Guo Guixiang returned to the village to scout the enemy's situation and visit students. Unfortunately, she was captured by the 157th Regiment of the Chiang Kai-shek bandit army. The beasts used all kinds of torture to interrogate her: "Is the Eighth Route Army doing well?" She said without hesitation: "Yes, the Eighth Route Army is good! The Communist Party is good! Chairman Mao is good!" The enemy then asked why the Central Army was not good? She replied firmly: "Can traitors be good? Can those who kill the common people be good?" When the enemy had no other way, they finally murdered and executed her. As she was walked down the street with her hands tied, she shouted loudly: "Long live the Communist Party!" "Long live Chairman Mao!" "Long live the Eighth Route Army!" Everyone who saw her along the street shed tears. Afterwards, the Jinji-Luyu Border Region Government issued a special order to commend her.

　　Ding Jixin
　　A primary school teacher in Beikangzhuang, Wangdu. After completing the propaganda for "Protecting the Wheat Harvest" in the summer of 1946, he was captured on the morning of June 23 at the entrance of Yanjiazhuang Village by several Kuomintang plainclothes police from Wangdu County disguised as peasants. Because Comrade Jixin was mighty and unyielding, the enemy tied him to Nankangzhuang and forced many peasants from various families to come and watch Comrade Jixin's tragic death. The special agents grinned hideously. When brutally killing Comrade Jixin, the special agents shouted triumphantly: "Let's sharpen our bayonets!" "See whose bayonet is faster and stabs more." They first got dry lime powder and rubbed it into Comrade Jixin's eyes, and then stabbed our Comrade Jixin one knife after another, stabbing hundreds of times in a row. Later, they cut off his head, cut open his chest, took out his heart and liver, and cut off the flesh on his calves one knife after another. Finally, they smashed his head with stones. The villagers all shed tears.

　　After hearing the news, the Wangdu Education Federation asked all schools in the county to describe in detail the spirit of Comrade Jixin's might and unyieldingness at the wheat break opening ceremony, and suspended classes for half a day to show mourning. At the same time, they launched donations to comfort and express condolences to Comrade Jixin's family.

　　There are countless teachers who sacrificed heroically like this, and it is impossible to write them all down. In just one spring "mopping-up" operation in Jizhong in 1940, eleven teachers were killed. In Xingtang County alone, eight teachers sacrificed during the War of Resistance.

　　These heroic deeds are the supreme glory of educational workers. Today, as the country is about to be completely liberated, we sincerely tell our heroic and sacrificed comrades-in-arms, please rest in peace! The Japanese invaders and the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang have all been defeated one by one under the iron fists of the people! A brand new China is about to be born! All of us on the education front will inherit your spirit of heroic struggle and work harder to make the flowers of New Democracy education, irrigated by your blood, bloom more beautifully and vividly in the land!

　　万世师表
    ——向抗日战争及人民解放战争中英勇牺牲的教师们致敬
    刘松涛
　　赵淮
    行唐三区犁沿庄人，贫农出身，抗战开始就加入了共产党，在村支部负责宣教工作。当日寇跃进蚕食的时候，村上修了炮楼，他经常到炮楼下喊话，散传单，写标语。后来村上的炮楼被打垮了，虽然三里外还有两个炮楼，他就把小学民校恢复起来，自己当教师，坚持工作，被选为全区模范。
    一九四四年冬天，不幸被俘，和附近村上八十多个老乡，囚禁在南城寨的敌据点里，一个个用绳索绑着，不能坐也不能躺，不让吃喝，有许多人活活冻死、饿死。但赵仍告诉群众不要暴露抗日秘密。后来敌人让群众每人用一百斤小米自赎；对赵不但不放，反绑在柱上，用猪毛绳蘸了凉水来抽打，可是敌人换来的只有愤怒的叱骂，敌人老羞成怒，用铁丝捆起他的手脚，抛在喂牲口的棚子里，任骡马践踏，赵淮同志就这样壮烈牺牲了。直到我们打下南城寨据点时，才在马粪中掘出了他的尸体。
　　任彬
    繁峙县老汉坪的小学教师，农民出身，朴素纯挚，只上过三年小学，但他工作能力很强，大半是在工作中练习的。
    老汉坪离敌人的据点很近，敌人常来扰乱，区公所为了开展这里的工作，决定调他去，他回村后，首先从开展文化娱乐着手，来动员儿童，更想尽办法，来适合群众的需要，这样使全村二十几个学龄儿童全部入学了。
    为了便于坚持工作，他又参加了游击小队，经常去袭击敌人。一九四五年二月十一日拂晓，敌人包围了老汉坪，挨家挨户搜人，任彬同志还在睡觉，敌人突然冲进来，放在桌上的报纸课本都来不及坚壁，他知道不能隐避，就顺手拿起地下一把劈柴用的斧头，和鬼子肉搏，接着进来了四个敌人，但他毫不示弱，跳上跳下，和敌人撕杀，砍断了一个敌人的腿，砍烂了一个敌人的脊梁，余下的也被打得遍体受伤，最后因为敌人越来越多，众寡悬殊，才被敌人的子弹打倒。
　　郭桂香
    洪洞县苏堡村小学的一位女教师。一九四六年秋天，蒋匪军侵占苏堡村，十月二十一日郭桂香同志回村侦察敌情，并看望学生，不幸被蒋匪军一五七团所俘，野兽们用尽所有的酷刑折磨拷问：“八路军还好不好？”他毫不迟疑的说：“好好、八路军好！共产党好！毛主席好！”敌人又问中央军为什么不好？她斩钉截铁的回答：“卖国贼还能好？杀老百姓还能好？”敌人再没办法了，最后下了毒手枪决她。当她被绑着手在街上走过的时候，还激昂的高呼着：“共产党万岁！”“毛主席万岁！”“八路军万岁！”沿街看到的人没有一个不掉泪的。事后晋冀鲁豫边区政府曾特别通令褒扬她。
　　丁计心
    望都北康庄的小学教师。一九四六年夏完成了“保卫麦收”的宣传后，六月二十三日清晨回家，在阎家庄村头被几个化装为农民的望都县国民党便衣警察捉住了，因计心同志威武不屈，敌人将他捆到南康庄，用手枪从各家赶来了许多农民，要让他们来看计心同志的惨死。特务裂着嘴狞笑。惨杀计心同志的时候，特务们还得意的叫喊：“给我们开开刺刀刃吧！”“看谁的刺刀快，刺得多。”他们先弄来干石灰末揉在计心同志的眼睛里，接着就一刀一刀的向我们的计心同志刺去，一连刺了几百刀，后来又割下脑袋，挑开胸膛，掏出心肝，把腿肚上的肉一刀一刀的拉下，最后更用石头砸烂了脑袋，村里人无不落泪。
    望都教联会听到这个消息之后，让全县各学校在麦假开学典礼大会上，详细讲述计心老师威武不屈的精神，并停课半天以示哀悼？同时发动捐款，救济慰问计心同志的家属。
    象这样英勇牺牲的教师是记不清写不完的，只冀中一九四○年一次春季“扫荡”中就有十一人，行唐一县抗战中就牺牲了八位教师。
    这些英勇的事迹，是教育工作者的无上光荣。在全国快要完全解放的今天，谨虔诚的告诉壮烈牺牲的战友们，请你们安息吧！日寇和蒋党匪帮，都在人民的铁拳下，一个个被打倒了！崭新的中国很快就要诞生！我们所有的教育战线的工作者，将继承你们英勇奋斗的精神，加倍努力，使灌溉了你们鲜血的土地上，开放更美丽更鲜艳的新民主主义教育的花朵！
