The bureau will have departments such as a Mediation Section, a Labor Welfare Section, a Research Office, and a Work Team. Directors Shi and Ma are scheduled to formally assume their duties on the 10th. After the establishment of the bureau, all labor-capital disputes, contract issues, or factory rules and labor discipline in private enterprises in the city must be approved by the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions and the Labor Bureau before they can take effect. The Labor Bureau will announce the detailed measures soon. Furthermore, according to the person in charge of the Labor Bureau: "For labor-capital dispute cases previously mediated by the people's governments of various districts, those in which both parties have agreed and there are no longer any disputes must be filed with the Labor Bureau; those with ongoing disputes will be mediated by the Labor Bureau."
