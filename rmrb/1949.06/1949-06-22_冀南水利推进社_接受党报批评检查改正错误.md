    Jinnan Water Conservancy Promotion Agency
    Accepts Party Newspaper Criticism, Examines and Corrects Errors
    [Jinnan Electric Dispatch] The Jinnan Water Conservancy Promotion Agency accepted criticism from Party newspapers (Jinnan Daily and People's Daily) and conducted a preliminary self-criticism. The leadership first recognized the erroneous view of purely seeking profit, one-sidedly emphasizing enterprise, and neglecting the basic task of promoting water conservancy construction. For example, when the masses came to the agency to borrow waterwheels, the interest rate was one-third higher than the market price (the market price was 1,000 jin of rice per wheel, while the agency charged 1,600 jin of rice), plus a five percent interest. As a result, the waterwheels were stockpiled for a long time and could not be lent out. Furthermore, there was bureaucratic work style and blind, unplanned management. Without prior investigation to understand the demands and needs of the masses, they went to Shimen to buy pipe waterwheels, which were not welcomed by the masses when transported to Yongnian, and then transported to Renxian, wasting back and forth and increasing costs. The Third Special District requested loans to repair waterwheels but were delayed in receiving them, delaying the agricultural season. After examination, they recognized these erroneous ideas and the losses they caused. In the future, they are determined to establish a serving-the-people ideology, strengthen planning, investigate and understand the needs of the masses, and achieve mastery of raw materials, market conditions, and factories, improve quality, reduce costs, and combine with local government and production promotion agencies to organize old waterwheel factories and mobilize the masses to repair large numbers of old waterwheels to develop water conservancy construction.

    冀南水利推进社
    接受党报批评检查改正错误
    【冀南电】冀南水利推进社接受党报（冀南日报和人民日报）批评，进行初步检讨。由于领导上首先认识了单纯营利的错误观点，片面强调企业化，忽视了推进水利建设的基本任务。如群众来社里贷水车，竟比市价还高三分之一（市价每辆千斤米，社里贷水车千六百斤），还有五厘利息，因此水车长期积压，迟迟贷不出去。再就是官僚主义作风和经营上的盲目无计划，事前不调查了解群众的要求和需要量，即去石门买管子水车，运到永年不为群众欢迎，又转运任县，往返浪费，增高成本。三专区要求贷款修水车却迟迟不发，耽误了农业季节。经检查认识到这些错误思想及其所造成的损失，今后决心要树立为人民服务思想，加强计划性，调查了解群众需要，做到掌握原料、掌握行情、掌握工厂，提高质量，降低成本，结合当地政府和生产推进社组织，修旧水车工厂，发动群众大量修旧水车，以开展水利建设。
