Reading the Newspaper: A Small Dictionary

　　Weimar Constitution—This was the German constitution formulated by the constitutional assembly convened in Weimar in February 1919. This constitution came into effect in August 1919 and was abandoned after the Nazi Hitler came to power. The Weimar Constitution is divided into two parts: the first part stipulates the organization and effectiveness of the federal government, such as adopting a cabinet system and the president being elected by the people; the second part stipulates the rights and obligations of citizens.

　　Warsaw Conference of Foreign Ministers of Eastern European Countries—On June 23, 1948, the foreign ministers of the Soviet Union, Albania, Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, Yugoslavia, Poland, Romania, and Hungary held a meeting in Warsaw, the capital of Poland, to discuss the problems caused by the unilateral decision of the London Six-Power Conference on the German question. Finally, a declaration was issued, severely condemning the decision of the United States, Britain, and France at the London Conference to split Germany, and put forward five suggestions for a four-power agreement to resolve the German question. The five suggestions are as follows: 1. Implement measures to ensure the final demilitarization of Germany through an agreement between the United Kingdom, the Soviet Union, France, and the United States. 2. In order to develop the peaceful sectors of the Ruhr industry and prevent the reconstruction of Germany's war potential, determine that the four powers (United Kingdom, Soviet Union, France, and the United States) should control the Ruhr heavy industry for a certain period of time. 3. Establish a democratic and peace-loving provisional government for the whole of Germany through an agreement between the governments of the United Kingdom, the Soviet Union, France, and the United States, composed of representatives of German democratic parties and groups, with the aim of creating a guarantee to prevent Germany from re-launching aggression. 4. Conclude a peace treaty with Germany in accordance with the Potsdam Agreement, so that the occupying forces of all countries can withdraw from Germany within one year after the conclusion of the peace treaty. 5. Formulate measures for Germany to fulfill its obligations to compensate countries that have suffered from German aggression.
