    IV. Teaching Method Combining Lectures, Discussions, and Question Answering
    Two months of experience have proven that this teaching method is very correct. Lectures are divided into large classes (several departments together, school-wide in nature) and joint class lectures (two or three classes together), but with large classes as the main focus and joint class lectures as supplementary. Discussions progress from small group discussions to large class discussions. All of this is based on self-study. At the beginning of the semester, most students had old learning habits, didn't know how to hold discussions, and therefore, discussions were cold and unenthusiastic. Some recited a few articles from their notes, without expressing their own understanding or arguing. The atmosphere was very rigid. In fact, this phenomenon was natural, because in the past everyone lacked the habit of collective life. Through continuous study and improvement, they gradually realized that learning revolutionary theory cannot be satisfied with simply reciting articles; it must be integrated with one's own ideological reality, applying criticism and self-criticism, adhering to the truth, and correcting mistakes. Otherwise, one cannot learn well. After recognizing this point, the discussions truly changed. The current discussion situation has been transformed. Many study competition books in each class and group have this written on them: "Guarantee universal speech and connect it with oneself." Under the spirit of promoting organized and guided democratic study and strengthening self-study, each group is further divided into two or three mutual aid groups. Seven or eight students with different cultural and theoretical levels and social backgrounds work together to study, prepare opinions, and help each other. This mutual aid group not only makes necessary preparations for the large discussion meeting, but also cultivates students' collective concept of mutual assistance and love. Problems that cannot be solved in the small group discussion are answered by the class; if the class cannot answer, they are raised to the department and school. Sometimes teachers also answer. Whether listening to lectures, discussions, or answering questions, the emphasis is on using the brain more, developing ideas, and requiring a true understanding of the principles, opposing blind learning. This requires doing a good job of combining theory with practice, criticism and self-criticism.
    V. Democratic Grading, Personal Summaries, and Learning Representative Conferences
    In order to affirm learning achievements, understand students' level of acceptance, and improve students' ideological understanding and awareness, a test is also held after each stage of learning. A mass-based democratic grading method is adopted. The method is that after the students complete the test papers, each department first creates a unified set of answers as the standard answers for the test questions, which are distributed to each group for circulation. Then, the groups collectively grade and assign scores, referring to the standard answers. During grading, the content of the papers is first commented and analyzed, what is wrong, what is right, and then the score is assigned. After all the test papers in the class are graded, the papers are publicly displayed according to their grades. According to the results of the implementation in April, it has been proven that democratic grading is a powerful and reasonable new method for measuring performance, promoting learning, and improving understanding. It is a mass movement. In the process of grading, incorrect ideas are corrected, understanding is improved, and positions and viewpoints are corrected through mutual discussion, comparison, and analysis, thereby enhancing students' enthusiasm and initiative. Because of the repeated comments from the masses, the grades are easily correct, making the test-takers readily convinced, and allowing for the summarization of teaching experience and the discovery of the advantages and disadvantages of teaching, so as to improve in the future. The last grading generally achieved the above good results. However, to do a good job of democratic grading, the key lies in truly being good at conducting ideological leadership and following the mass line, so that democratic grading forms a mass movement. In the movement, theoretical and ideological problems are continuously solved. Therefore, in advance, thorough mobilization should be carried out in light of the students' ideological situation, explaining the purpose and method of the examination, and preventing possible biases. Then, it is also necessary to promptly grasp the specific situation of the whole class in the grading process, and give guidance at any time, so that the leadership is closely integrated with the masses, and detours can be avoided. In addition, in order to make it easy to combine leadership and the masses in various learning and work, each class has a learning representative meeting, which is composed of two or three representatives elected by each group of students. It is a mass organization that assists the class cadres in leading the students. It is a mass organization that combines discussion and action under the educational and administrative leadership of the school. It is also the most effective and convenient organization for promoting learning movements, creating learning enthusiasm, and launching learning competitions. It has become a bridge for leading cadres to connect with students, and the school is deciding to systematically establish it from the class to the school.
    In addition, each class and group has also created many new learning methods, such as dispatching exchange students, launching mutual competitions, electing learning models, and designating specific people to answer questions. In front of each class, especially in the club, the walls are covered with wall newspapers, the content includes studying current affairs, discussing learning, and examining one's own ideological style, etc., which plays a great role in exchanging experiences and transforming ideas.

    四、讲授、讨论、问题解答——三者结合的教学方法
    两个月的经验证明，这种教学方法是很正确的。讲授分上大课（几个部在一起，全校性质的）及班联课（两三个班在一起）两种方式，但以上大课为主，班联课为辅；讨论会是从小组讨论再提高到全班的大讨论会；但这都要在自学的基础上展开，对此种学习方法，在开学之初，由于绝大部分学员们脑里存着旧的学习方法，不会开讨论会，因而在讨论的时候，发言很冷落，有的拿出笔记念几句条文，不会根据自己的理解发表意见，更没有争论，会场空气很死板，实在说来，因为过去大家没有集体生活习惯，这种现象也是很自然的。经过不断的学习和提高，逐步认识到学习革命理论，不能满足于条文的背诵，必须结合自己的思想实际融会贯通，运用批评与自我批评，坚持真理，修正错误，否则就学不好。当认识了这点后，讨论会才真正改观了，现在的讨论会情形已经转变过来，在各班各组的学习竞赛书上很多都写着这一条：“保证普遍发言，并且联系自己”。在发扬有组织有领导的民主学习，加强自修这一种精神下，每一小组又分为两、三个互助小组。七八个文化理论水平和社会出身都不相同的学员在一起，共同研究，准备意见，互相帮助。这种互助小组，不仅能为大讨论会议做出必要的准备，并且还培养着同学们互助友爱的集体观念。在小组讨论中提出的不能解决的问题由班里解答，班不能解答，就提到部及校部解答，有时教员也解答，不论听讲、讨论和解答问题，都强调多用脑筋，发展思想，要求真正懂清道理，反对盲目性的学习，这就需要很好地做到理论与联系实际，批评与自我批评。
    五、民主评卷个人总结和学习代表会议
    为了肯定学习成绩、了解学员接受程度、提高学员思想认识和觉悟程度，每一阶段学习后，还举行一次测验，采用了群众性的民主评卷方式，其方法是学生试卷答完后，先由各部统一作出一份试题答案，作为试题的标准答案，发给各小组传阅，然后以小组为单位，参照标准答案，集体进行评卷定分。评卷时对卷的内容先加以评论分析，那些是错的，那些是对的，然后再定分。评卷定分在全班试卷评完后，按成绩好坏，将试卷公开展览。根据四月份运用的结果，证明民主评卷是测验成绩、推动学习、提高认识之有力的合理的新方法。它是一种群众运动，在评卷中由于互相讨论比较分析，纠正了不正确的思想，提高了认识，端正了立场和观点，提高了学员的积极性与自觉性。由于群众的反复评论，评定的也容易正确，而使答卷人容易心悦诚服，并可总结教学经验，发现教学的优缺点，以便今后改进。上次评卷，一般的收到了以上的良好效果。但要作好民主评卷，决定关键，是要真正善于进行思想领导和走群众路线，使民主评卷形成一种群众运动。在运动中不断解决理论问题和思想问题等。所以事先就要针对学员的思想情况作好深入的动员，说明考试的目的和方法，并防止可能产生的偏向，然后还要及时掌握全班，在评卷中的具体情况，随时予以指导，使领导紧紧的与群众相结合，就可以避免走弯路。此外学校为使在各种学习和工作中都容易做到领导和群众相结合起见，每班有学习代表会的成立，由每组同学选举两三名代表组成，它是协助班干部领导同学的群众性组织，它是在学校教育行政领导下，议行合一的群众自己的组织，也是推动学习运动、造成学习热潮、展开学习竞赛是最得力最方便的组织。它已成为领导干部联系同学之桥梁，学校正决定由班到校部将其系统的建立起来。
    另外各班各组还创造了许多新的学习方法，如派遣留学生，互相展开竞赛，选举学习模范，点将回令等。各班的前面，特别是俱乐部里贴满了壁报，内容有研究时事，有讨论学习，有检讨自己的思想作风等，对于交流经验，改造思想起了很大作用。
