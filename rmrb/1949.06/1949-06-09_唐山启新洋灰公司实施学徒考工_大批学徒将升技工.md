(Tangshan Electric Dispatch) Among the more than 240 technical workers in the East Repair Machine Factory of Tangshan Qixin Cement Company, there are 135 young apprentices. Their working experience is generally around four to five years. The lowest is more than three years, and the highest is eight years and eight months. This is an unreasonable phenomenon left over from the Kuomintang rule. According to the Sixth National Labor Congress's resolution that "the apprenticeship period should not exceed three years at most", this urgently needs to be changed. During the Kuomintang rule, all apprentices repeatedly requested the factory to be promoted to craftsmen, but were refused. After liberation, the workers had their own trade union organization, and all the apprentices, through the trade union, suggested to the factory to take steps to promote the apprentices to formal technicians. After the trade union suggested abolishing the unreasonable contract system in the factory in February, the second step was to carry out this work. After negotiations with the factory and obtaining consent, the trade union and the factory each appointed five representatives to form an "Examination Committee". After a period of understanding and preparation, a meeting was held on May 25th and 26th to discuss the specific methods of the examination, and it was decided to start with the 135 apprentices of the East Repair Machine Factory first. The content of the examination is specified according to the nature of the work of each workshop. The examination shall be conducted on the principle of not affecting production. It was decided to start the examination from May 27th. All examinations will be completed within one week. The scoring standard is 70 percent for the examination results, 25 percent for the usual performance (including attendance), and 5 percent for the length of service (Editor's note: The basis for determining this percentage is not explained, and it is hoped that the results will continue to be reported after implementation). The scoring group, composed of factory technicians, representatives of the trade union preparatory committee, and old technicians of the headquarters, will first make a preliminary assessment, and then submit it to the entire technical worker and apprentice of the department for democratic discussion as the final decision. The standard for promotion is that those with a score of 60 to 80 points will be given the treatment of Grade D technicians; those with more than 80 points will be given the treatment of Grade C technicians. The resolution of the Examination Committee has been passed at the general meeting of all technicians and apprentices in the East Repair Machine Factory. Each workshop is now conducting examinations.

　　唐山启新洋灰公司实施学徒考工
    大批学徒将升技工
    【唐山电】唐山启新洋灰公司东修机厂二百四十余名技术工人中，有青年学徒一百三十五人，工龄一般都在四年至五年左右，最低的也超过了三年，高的则有到八年零八个月的。这是从国民党统治时期遗留下来的一种不合理现象。按全国第六次劳大决议“学徒年限最多不得超过三年”，此种亟须改变。在国民党统治时期，全体学徒曾多次向厂方要求改升工匠，均遭拒绝。解放后，工人们有了自己职工会的组织，全体学徒乃通过职工会，向厂方建议，采取步骤提升学徒为正式技工。职工会于二月间建议取消了厂内不合理的包工柜制度后，第二步即进行此项工作。经向厂方交涉，取得同意，由职工会及厂方各推出代表五人，组成“考工委员会”，经过一段了解和准备时间，于五月二十五、二十六两日开会讨论考工的具体办法，决定先由东修机厂的一百三十五名学徒做起。考工内容，依各工作间的工作性质分别规定。考工进行以不影响生产为原则。决定从五月二十七日起开始考觅。在一个星期以内全部考完。评分标准以考觅成绩占百分之七十，平时成绩（包括考勤）占百分之二十五，工龄占百分之五（编者按：确定此项百分比的根据未说明，希能在实施后继续报道其结果）。由工厂技术人员职工筹备会代表及本部老技术工人组成的评分小组，先作初步评定，再交本工作部门全体技术工学徒民主讨论，作为最后决定。提升的标准是成绩在六十分以上至八十分的，给予丁级技工待遇；八十分以上的给予丙级技工待遇。考工委员会的决议已在东修机厂全体技工学徒大会上通过。现各工作间正在进行考觅。
