Xinhua News Agency, Dalian, 7th. Several large-scale Sino-Soviet joint ventures in the Lüda area have successfully completed and exceeded their production targets for the Red May production campaign. The competition initiated by workers at the Dalian Shipyard to support the Chinese Communist Party not only ensured the successful completion of the May ship repair tasks but also completed the June tasks a month ahead of schedule, by the end of May. The glass factory under the Far East Electric Power Bureau also completed its May tasks 14 days ahead of schedule, exceeding the original plan by 53% by the end of the month. Although the May production plan for the light bulb factory was 34% higher than that of April, it was also completed five days ahead of schedule thanks to the efforts of all workers in the factory. To celebrate the anniversary of the Chinese Communist Party, each factory has pledged to exceed its June production plan by "July 1st." The glass factory under the Far East Electric Power Bureau held a mobilization meeting on May 31st to welcome "July 1st" and complete the annual production tasks ahead of schedule. At the meeting, the chairman of the trade union and the deputy director of the factory pointed out that, with the efforts of all workers, 83% of the annual production plan has now been completed. Therefore, they called for not only completing the annual production tasks before "July 1st" but also reducing costs by 6% and increasing efficiency by 5%. Workers in various shipyards under the Shipbuilding Company of the Lüda Administrative Office are also universally launching a competition to welcome "July 1st" and complete production tasks ahead of schedule. Workers at the First Shipyard have pledged to complete the plan to repair and build 50-ton fishing boats before "July 1st."
