　　Total Strike of 2.5 Million Workers in All Sectors of Agriculture Across Italy
  　In Solidarity with Striking Agricultural Workers
    [Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 17th] Reports from various sources: On the 15th, 2.5 million workers in all sectors of agriculture across Italy, under the call of the General Confederation of Labor, held a 24-hour general strike to support the two million agricultural workers across Italy who have been on strike for nearly a month. Due to obstruction by the landowners, negotiations between the agricultural workers' union organization and the General Confederation of Labor (one party) and the Landowners' Association (the other party) broke down on the 12th. According to TASS, Rome, on the 15th, the strike has entered its most acute stage, and the rural situation has become serious, with new events occurring every day. The police have taken bloody atrocities against the strikers. On June 14th, Modena and Bologna announced strikes to protest police violence and bloody treatment of strikers. The Agricultural Workers' General Confederation, affiliated with the General Confederation of Labor, subsequently announced a general strike on June 15th to protest the Landowners' Association's refusal to negotiate with the union. The Italian General Confederation of Labor called on all working people of Italy to donate to the strike fund to express their support for the agricultural workers. Vittorio, General Secretary of the Italian General Confederation of Labor, told reporters: "The general strike of agricultural workers in Italy has entered a decisive stage. The problems that caused the strike must be resolved at this stage to avoid serious damage threatening the national economy. The damage that the national economy has already suffered is insignificant compared to the damage it faces due to the absurdity and obstinacy of the landowners." The rural situation caused by the strike was discussed at the meeting of the Supreme Committee of the Italian General Confederation of Labor held in Rome. At that meeting, Vittorio said: "In the current situation, the failure of the Italian agricultural proletariat will mean the failure of the entire Italian proletariat, while the victory of the agricultural proletariat will mean the victory of all working people." Vittorio sharply criticized the government's policy, saying: "This policy fully supports the illegal activities of the landowners, who receive the support and protection of the police force at all times and in all places." In analyzing the situation, Vittorio finally pointed out: "It is now completely clear that our struggle cannot be merely economic in nature. The disturbances and strikes of the past few weeks were caused by economic reasons. However, the Italian working people are forced to counter the employers' offensive, which has a definite political character."

　　全意农业区各业工人
  　二百五十万人总罢工
    声援坚持罢工中的农业工人
    【新华社北平十七日电】各方报道：十五日，意大利全国农业地区的二百五十万各业工人，在总工会的号召之下，举行总罢工二十四小时，以声援罢工已近一月的全意二百万农业工人。由于地主方面的阻挠，农业工人的工会组织与总工会（一方）和地主联合会（另一方）之间的谈判于十二日破裂。据塔斯社罗马十五日讯，罢工已进入最尖锐的阶段，农村情势已趋于严重化，新的事件每天都在发生，警察对罢工者采取血腥的暴行。六月十四日，莫登那和波伦亚宣布了抗议警察暴力统治和血腥对待罢工者的罢工。总工会所属的农业工人总工会，随之在六月十五日宣布总罢工，抗议地主联合会拒绝与工会谈判。意大利总工会号召意大利的一切劳动人民以援助基金献给罢工者，表示他们对农业工人的支持。意大利总工会总书记维特里奥告记者称：“意大利农业工人的总罢工，已进入了决定阶段。在这个阶段中引起罢工的问题必须予以解决，以避免威胁着国民经济的严重损害。国民经济迄今所已经受到的损害，与它因地主的荒谬、顽固而面临的损害比较起来，是不足道的。”罢工所引起的农村方面的局势，曾在罗马举行的意大利总工会的最高委员会会议上讨论。维特里奥在那次会议上说：“在目前局势下，意大利农业无产阶级的失败，就将意味着整个意大利无产阶级的失败，而农业无产阶级的胜利，则意味着全体劳动人民的胜利。”维特里奥尖锐批评政府所遵循的政策称：“这个政策完全支持地主的非法活动，地主们随时随地都受到警察力量的支持和保护。”维特里奥在分析局势时最后指出：“事情已经完全清楚，即我们的斗争决不能只是经济性质的。过去数周间的骚动和罢工，是经济原因引起的。但是，意大利劳动人民却被迫给雇主们的其有确定的政治性质的进攻以反击。”
