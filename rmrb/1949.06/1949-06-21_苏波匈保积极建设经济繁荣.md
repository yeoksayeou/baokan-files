    While American capitalists frown upon the increasingly deteriorating economic situation, the Soviet Union and the new democratic countries of Eastern Europe are committed to productive construction for economic prosperity. In Moscow, the capital of the Soviet Union, workers, foremen, technicians, engineers, and staff of various enterprises have drawn up plans, assuring Stalin that they will complete the five-year plan for industrial production in four years, and will reach the 1950 production target stipulated in the five-year plan this year. Thanks to the good organization of spring sowing, the output of grain, industrial crops, and other crops in the Soviet Union will increase significantly this year. The Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union have called on party organizations, agricultural institutions, and farmers to carefully prepare for the harvesting and processing of agricultural products. In Poland, the Council of Ministers has formulated a six-year economic plan to increase national income by 97 percent. Under the labor competition, all sectors of Polish industry exceeded production plans in May. Workers in Tczew, northern Romania, issued a labor challenge to the national machinery manufacturing industry earlier this month. The Hungarian people are building a new city on the southern border. The Presidium of the National Assembly of Bulgaria recently awarded labor medals to 250 outstanding workers and farmers.
    Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 19th - The Council of Foreign Ministers of the Soviet Union, the United States, Britain and France is coming to an end. The fourth week of the Foreign Ministers' meeting is to discuss the fourth item on the agenda - the Austrian treaty issue and the provisional agreement on the German situation.
