　　People's Bank of Xuanhua Branch

  　Absorbs Idle Capital for Production
  　Loans Support Industrial and Commercial Businesses

    [Xuanhua News] In order to develop urban industrial production and regulate the turnover of funds in the market, the People's Bank of Xuanhua Branch is vigorously absorbing deposits for productive enterprises that benefit the national economy and the people's livelihood, and supporting and developing industry and commerce. In May, it absorbed 41,344,000 yuan in deposits from public enterprises. By the end of the month, it had absorbed deposits from 234 private businesses, an increase of 185 compared to April, totaling 10,063,200 yuan in deposits. Throughout the month, loans were issued to two public factories, totaling 2,170,000 yuan; commercial loans to 50 businesses, totaling 1,293,300 yuan; overdrafts to municipal companies and supply and marketing cooperatives, totaling 18,970,000 yuan; cooperative loans to five public entities, totaling 4,440,000 yuan; and loans to 87 private industrial enterprises, totaling 5,992,200 yuan. These included iron factories, hemp paper, soap, woodworking, flour milling, dyeing, fur, shoemaking, saltpeter boiling, and felt hat industries. Dechangmao Hat Shop, in the felt hat industry, originally had a capital of 140,000 yuan. After the bank loaned it 120,000 yuan, it borrowed another 400 jin of naked oat flour, 33 shi of millet, and 80 bolts of white cloth. This one shop alone stimulated over 1 million yuan in private capital. The number of workers and apprentices also increased from 362 to 516.
    The main shortcoming in lending is that the investigation and understanding are not thorough enough. For example, the Gongmin Cooperative Hat Shop in the fifth street of the first district originally took capital from the Gongmin Supply and Marketing Cooperative. Due to insufficient funds, it borrowed 200,000 yuan from the bank. After inspection, it was found that only 58,000 yuan was used for the hat shop, and the rest was used for supply and marketing operations to purchase grain in Zhangbei. The bank will recover the loan from the shop. Therefore, in deposit and loan operations, not only should there be better investigation and understanding beforehand, but also post-loan inspections should be carried out so that loans can be used well for production.

　　人民银行宣化支行
  　吸收游资投向生产
  　贷款扶植工商业户
    【宣化讯】人民银行宣化支行为了发展城市工业生产，调剂市面资金周转，以大力吸收存款运用于有利国计民生的生产事业，扶植与发展工商业。五月份吸收公营企业存款四千一百卅四万四千元，吸收私商存款至月底达二百三十四户，较四月份增一百八十五户，共收入存款一千零六十三万二千元。全月放出公营工厂二户，贷款二百十七万元，商业贷款五十户，计一百二十九万三千元，活存透支市公司供销合作社等四户，透支额一千八百九十七万元；合作放款公营五户，贷款四百四十四万元；私人工业放款共八十七家，共贷五百九十九万二千元；包括铁工厂、麻纸、肥皂、木工、制粉、染业、皮毛业、制鞋、熬硝、毡帽业等行业。毡帽业德长茂帽铺原资本十四万，银行贷给十二万后，自己又借莜面四百斤，小米三十三石，白市布八十匹，只这一家就带动私资一百余万元。工人学徒人员等也由三百六十二人增到五百十六人。
    在贷款当中的主要缺点，是有的调查了解不深入，例如一区五街工民合作帽铺，原来是工民供销合作社拿的资本，因资金不足向银行贷二十万后经检查用于帽铺只五万八千元，其余均用于供销业务到张北购粮，银行将向该铺追回其贷款，因此在存放贷款中，不但要事前更好调查了解，而贷后也要进行检查，贷款才能很好的用于生产。（宣化支行通讯小组）
