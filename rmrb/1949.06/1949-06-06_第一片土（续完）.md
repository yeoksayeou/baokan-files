　　The First Piece of Land (Continued)
    Hu Feng

    The sky darkened, only the snow on the mountains across was shining whitely through the half-open paper window. During the conversation just now, he mentioned that the Japanese regarded this place as very important. On a mountain peak beyond the one opposite, there was a modern lighthouse, a steel and concrete structure with hot and cold water pipes and sanitary facilities, which was inhabited by the Japanese during the enemy puppet regime. Now, looking at the white snow, it seemed as if we ourselves had come here to guard this border.

    The Wang Section Chief, who had gone out at some point, came back in with an oil lamp. He showed Liu Bureau Chief two white cloth circles. These were armbands that the villagers had prepared for unloading cargo on the ship. According to their conversation, one had the words "Captain" written on it, and the other had "Squad Leader."

    The young Bureau Chief seemed to smile and said:

    "There's no need to write these. Just write 'Wangjiadao Wharf Union,' and put a number underneath, that's all."

    But the Section Chief brought the cloth circles closer to him:

    "The villagers are happy, they made it themselves. Look, they're quite exquisite!"

    It seemed the Bureau Chief smiled again:

    "Let them keep the ones that are already made. For the rest, keep it simple. Write 'Wangjiadao Wharf Union' horizontally, and put a number underneath, that's all."

    He thought for a moment, found paper and a pencil from the drawer of the tea table on the kang, and drew a sample in the dim yellow light. He handed it to Wang Section Chief and also instructed him to stamp the number with the branch's seal.

    We asked about the Wang Section Chief's experiences after he went out. This time, his tone seemed slightly higher:

    "Only twenty-three years old, doesn't seem like it, right? Shandong native, farmer, wounded three times in battle, a veteran with honors. He's not very keen on this work now, always wants to go back to the army."

    He paused, as if remembering something, and a clear smile was illuminated by the dim yellow light. He added: "Most of those who have been soldiers are like that..."

    Thus, the conversation led to the military. He still used a gentle tone, talking about the nature of the People's Liberation Army, the strengths of several outstanding generals and the Party's evaluation of them, talking about the "brilliant strategists" among them, talking about the military's class education. I heard for the first time about the two forms of bitterness sessions and memorial ceremonies. In the bitterness sessions, the soldiers poured out all the exploitation and injustice they had suffered from the landlords. After venting their bitterness, they would choose a day to hold a solemn memorial ceremony. Even the leaders of the column personally participated. The memorial tablets of the parents or relatives who had died unjustly were placed above. The soldiers swore revenge in front of the tablets. Often, as soon as the report began, everyone would burst into tears, even the leaders couldn't lift their heads from crying. … Class hatred produced a firm determination, the source of the People's Liberation Army's invincible courage.

    Wang Section Chief had already returned. When the conversation moved from the above to the brave circumstances of combat, he enthusiastically joined in, laughing with every sentence, as if a joyful, leaping melody suddenly emerged in the middle of a calm movement.

    ——After the artillery bombardment, a little red flag waves, haha! With a whoosh... a shout, haha! People all jump up and run forward, haha! And rush over in one go, haha!…

    ——After winning the battle, people are all along both sides of the road, haha! Old women, girls, children, they're all here, haha! Chickens, peanuts, stuffing your pockets full, haha! Even the cannons are decorated with flowers, haha!…

    At this time, his Bureau Chief remained silent, smiling with his eyes downcast, listening quietly, as if he was hearing such stories for the first time, as if he was listening with fascination.

    This Bureau Chief, who treated his young subordinates with affection, was actually only a twenty-seven-year-old youth himself. During the War of Resistance, he was just a fifteen-year-old member of the National Salvation Vanguard Team, who, with general patriotic enthusiasm, joined the guerrilla war and served as a company political instructor:

    "At that time, all I did was sing songs and shout slogans, I didn't understand anything!"

    For twelve years, he had been walking the road of struggle, undergoing the tempering of the revolution. The process was of course a moving and rich history, but this brief encounter was unable to delve into it deeply. But at least it was possible to get in touch with the result from the outside: the kind of profoundness that could only be expressed with a gentle appearance, and the kind of clear and simple strength that had a thorough understanding of the overall situation of the revolution and was both considerate and meticulous in daily work.

    However, despite this, or rather, precisely because of this, he did not show any pride in the victory of the revolution. Instead, he talked about the difficulty of construction work to refer to the victory of the revolution. After talking about the need to move towards specialization in the future, he quietly said in a lowered voice:

    "Like me, after doing this for so many years, I don't have any special skills. I have to learn some specialized skills!"

    This sentence was very heavy, but the voice was very low. The listeners could all feel that this was not said to us or anyone else, but to himself. Perhaps it was because he regarded us all as specialized technicians, thus arousing his feelings, but everyone could feel that it was by no means a polite gesture towards us. Therefore, we all remained silent, and even one or two who had just returned from abroad and still retained the habit of saying social pleasantries could not say a suitable word.

    This sentence was too heavy, but those who had grown up under the education and cultivation of the Party from their youth would surely have a deep sense of resonance with the Party's call to move towards specialization.

    It was time to rest, and I was left to sleep on the kang with the two hosts.

    When the young Section Chief was packing his things, I asked him if he had any family. He seemed to pause, but immediately said in a calm, low voice, completely different from his previous jumping tone, and quickly said:

    "All alone. Just two brothers, the elder one also joined the army."

    As soon as he finished speaking, he quickly busied himself again, continuing to pack things on the kang.

    After going to sleep, a feeling of excitement stirred me, as if I should still hear countless stories from their mouths. But they had work to do tomorrow, and had already turned off the lights and gone to sleep. My mood was fluctuating, but I also heard them tossing and turning, unable to fall asleep. Like this, it probably lasted for about two hours.

    The next morning, we set off. All wearing coats, gloves, and wool scarves, "fully armed." Still only the young Section Chief, wearing a padded army uniform, led the soldiers and villagers carrying luggage, a long line, towards the bay. The young Bureau Chief insisted on seeing us off, only putting on a leather hat, not wearing his Japanese military leather coat hanging at the head of the kang, and walked with us behind the line.

    On the village road leading down to the bay, there were some villagers standing by the roadside. Among them was an old man, wearing a soiled gray long cotton robe. Every time one of us passed, he would bow and murmur something, as if asking why we were leaving so quickly and not staying a few more days.

    The sky was very gloomy, and a biting cold wind was blowing. The closer we got to the sea, the stronger the wind and the colder it felt. Walking crookedly on the large and small pebbles, the old man's shadow kept swaying in front of my eyes.

    When gathering the luggage, we discovered that the few boxes of shrimp noodles we had left for the hosts had also been brought over. Our team leader, Lao Du, took them to the young Bureau Chief, explained it, but the host insisted on not accepting them, wanting us to take them away. After pushing several times, he didn't say anything more, letting Lao Du put them there, considering it as acceptance. At this time, I remembered his refusal to accept the merchant's gift of beer yesterday, but then it seemed that I heard his voice when he first spoke to us:

    "Once you've arrived at your home, how can you not come down..."

    I still felt that there was nothing but sincerity in that gentle tone.

    People and luggage were still sent to the steamer in batches by small wooden boats. We thanked the villagers and soldiers, and said goodbye to the young Bureau Chief, the National Salvation Vanguard Team member twelve years ago, with a gentle handshake, and said goodbye to the young Shandong farmer with an enthusiastic handshake.

    The wind at sea was even colder, and the steamer was small. Those who went up first all went down to the cabin in order. I went up last, and turned around to look at the shore again. The soldiers and villagers had already turned back and walked far away, but the two young hosts were still standing on the beach, wearing short clothes in the biting cold wind.

    I couldn't help but take off my hat and waved it a few times to them, and they also raised their hands and waved.

    The steamer started, sailing towards the northeast mainland in the biting cold wind.

    But they were still standing on the windy beach, not moving. I couldn't help but wave my hat to them again, and I could see them raising their hands again. Getting further and further away, the two figures became smaller and smaller, more and more blurred, but they were still standing there. I couldn't help but wave my hat continuously, but I couldn't see clearly whether they were still in a gesture of raising their hands. Under the gloomy sky, I looked at the two figures gradually moving away in the biting cold wind, two steely and young warriors guarding the border of the people's motherland.

　　第一片土（续完）
    胡风
    天色暗了下来，只有对过山上的积雪向半开着的纸窗白皑皑地亮着。刚才谈话中间，他曾说到日本人把这个地方看得很重要，在对面山头过去的一个山头上，有一个现代化的大灯塔，钢骨水泥的建筑，里面有冷热水管和卫生设备，敌伪时代有日本人住在这里。现在，望着白皑皑的雪光，好象我们自己也是为了守卫这国境线而来到这里的。
    不知什么时候出去了的王所长端着油灯进来了。他拿两个用白布做的圆圈给刘局长看。这是老乡们预备到船上卸货用的袖章。听他们底对话，一个上面写着“大队长”，一个写着“中队长”的字样。
    青年局长好象现出了微笑，说：
    “何必写这些。就写王家岛码头工会，下面写上一个号码，就行了。”
    但所长把布圈拿近了他一些：
    “老乡们高兴，自己做的。你瞧，挺精致呢！”
    好象局长又现出了微笑：
    “这做好了的就让他们。其余的，简单些，横写着王家岛码头工会，下面写一个号码，就行了。”
    他想了一想，从炕上的茶机抽屉里找出了纸和铅笔，就着微黄的灯光画了一个样子。交给了王所长还叮嘱着，要在号码上盖一个分所的印。
    我们问到走出去了的王所长底经历，这一次他底声调似乎略略高了一点：
    “才二十三岁，不象罢？山东人，农民，作战三次负伤，是荣誉军人。现在这工作不大乐意，老想回到部队去。”
    停了一停，好象想起了什么，被微黄的灯光照出了一个明显的微笑，又补上了一句：“当过战士的，大半都是这样。……”
    于是，谈话引到了军队方面。他依然是用着文静的声调，谈到人民解放军底性质，谈到几个特出将领底长处和党对于他们的评价，谈到他们里面的“英明的战略家”，谈到军队底阶级教育，我第一次听到了的诉苦和祭灵这两个形式。在诉苦运动当中，战士们把从地主受到的剥削和冤屈尽情地说了出来，吐了苦水以后，就选定日子举行庄严的祭灵仪式。连纵队首长都亲自参加的。上面排着冤死了的父母或亲人们底牌位，战士们对着牌位宣誓报仇，往往报告一开始大家就失声痛哭，连首长们都哭着抬不起头来。……阶级的仇恨产生了坚强的决心，人民解放军无敌勇气底源泉。
    王所长早已转来了。当谈话从上面引到了作战的勇敢情形的时候，他热情爆发地参加了进来，说一句笑一声，好象在平静的乐章中间突然涌出了一股欢乐的跳跃的旋律一样。
    ——大炮轰过了以后，小红旗儿一摇，哈哈！哗……地一声喊，哈哈！人都跳起来向前飞跑，哈哈！一下子就冲了过去，哈哈！……
    ——打了胜仗回来，道儿两边都是人，哈哈！老太婆，闺女，小孩子，都来啦，哈哈！鸡子儿，花生豆，尽往你兜儿装，哈哈！连大炮都戴上了花，哈哈！……
    这时候，他底局长不做声了，微笑地俯着眼睛，静静地听着，好象是第一次听到这样的故事，好象听得沉醉了。
    这个友爱地对待着他底下属青年同志的局长本人，其实也还只是一个二十七岁的青年。抗战那一年，只不过是一个十五岁的民先队员，凭着一般爱国热情，参加了游击战争，担任了连指导员的职务：
    “那时候，只是唱唱歌，喊喊口号，啥也不懂！”
    十二年以来，他走着斗争的路，受着革命底锻炼。那过程当然是一部动人的丰富的历史，然而，这短促的相遇是无法深入进去的。但总算能够从外表上接触到了那个结果：只有用文静的外貌才能表现出来的那一种深沉，和对革命大势了如指掌，对日常工作又体贴又入微的那一种明敏而又朴厚的力量
    然而，虽然如此，或者说正是因为如此，对于革命底胜利他没有现出任何骄傲的口气，倒反而是用建设工作底艰巨性来谈到革命底胜利的。谈到了以后要走向专门化以后，用着低沉下去了的声音静静地说：
    “象我这样，搞了这多年，啥专长也没有，非学点专门本事不行！”
    这句话很沉重，但声音却很低，听的人都可以感觉到：这不是对着我们或任何别人，而是对他自己说的。也许因为他把我们全当做了专门技术家，因而引起了感触的罢，但谁也感觉得到那决不是对于我们的客套。所以，我们听了都默不作声，连刚从外国回来，还保持着说交际客套的一两位也不能说出一句适当的话来。
    这句话太沉重了，然而，从少年期起被党底教育培养得成长起来了的，对于党所提出的应该走向专门化的号召一定会从心灵深处生出他底感应的罢。
    要休息了，我被留着睡在和两个主人同睡的这个炕上。
    当那青年所长收拾东西的时候，我问到他家里有些什么人。似乎他顿了一顿，但马上用着和以前跳动的调子完全不同的，平静的低声，很快地说：
    “光光的。只哥儿俩，老大也参了军。”
    一说完就马上又快活地忙了起来，接着去收拾炕上的东西。
    睡下了以后，一种兴奋的情绪鼓动着我，好象还应该从他们底嘴里听到无数的事情。但他们明天还有工作，而且已经息了灯，睡下了。心情起伏着，却又听到他们也在转动着不能睡去。就这样，大概经过了两小时左右的时间。
    第二天上午，我们动身了。都是大衣、手套、羊毛围巾，“全副武装”。依然只是穿着夹军服的青年所长领着战士们和老乡们扛着行李，一长串，向海湾走去。青年局长一定要送，只套上了一顶皮帽，并不穿上他那件挂在炕头的日本军用皮大衣，和我们走在行列后面。
    在下到海湾去的拐弯的村道旁边，有一些老乡站在路边，那里面有一个老人，穿着污旧的灰色长棉袍，我们每一个人走过的时候他都鞠一鞠躬，嘴里喃喃地说着什么，好象是为什么走得这样快，不多住几天呢这一类的意思。
    天色很阴沉，吹着凛冽的寒风，越走近海边就觉得那风越大，越冷。歪歪斜斜地在大大小小的石卵上走着，那个老人底影子老是在我眼前晃来晃去。
    归集行李的时候，发现了我们留给主人们的几盒虾子面也被搬来了。我们领队的老杜提去送到青年局长面前，说明了，但主人坚持不收，要我们带走，推了好几次他才没有再说什么，让老杜放在那里，算是接受了。这时候，我记起了昨天他拒绝商人赠送啤酒的情形，但接着就仿佛又听到了他第一次和我们说话的声音：
    “到了家，哪能不下来……”
    依然觉得那文静的声调里面除了诚恳是没有别的什么的。
    人和行李还是用小木船分批送到汽船上去。我们谢了老乡们和战士们，和十二年前的民先队员文静地握了别，和山东的青年农民热烈地握了别。
    海上的风更冷，汽船又小，先上去的人都挨次下到了舱里。我最后上去，再回转身去望一望岸上，战士们和老乡们都已经转去，走得很远了，但两个青年主人还站在海边的石滩上，穿着短衣站在凛冽的寒风里面。
    我不禁取下帽子向他们挥了几下，他们也举起手来摇动了。
    汽船开动了，冒着凛冽的寒风向东北大陆驶去。
    但他们还是站在吹着寒风的石滩上，没有动。我不禁又向他们挥了帽子，看得见他们又举起了手来。渐走渐远，两个人影越小，越模糊，但却依然站在那里。我不禁接连挥着帽子，但已经看不清他们是不是举起了手来的姿势。在阴沉的天色下面，我望着在凛冽的寒风里面渐渐远了下去的两个人影，保卫着人民祖国国境线的两个钢强而年青的战士。
