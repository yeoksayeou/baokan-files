    Jianping Special District Calls Special Meeting to Control Aphids and Protect Cotton

    [This Newspaper Reported] In most areas of Zhengding, Huolu, Jingxing, Xingtang, Pingshan, and Lingshou counties in the Jianping Special District, aphids have appeared, directly threatening the growth of cotton seedlings. In Zhengding, some cotton seedlings have already shown signs of leaf curling and withering, and some have begun to die. In order to prevent insect damage and save the 350,000 mu of cotton seedlings that have already survived, the Special District urgently convened a meeting of agricultural technical cadres from all nine counties in the Special District and four farms including Zhengding on June 5th. Yang Qingzheng, head of the Promotion Section of the North China Farm, and 12 other comrades also rushed from Shijiazhuang to participate in the guidance. Commissioner Cui Minsheng personally led the meeting to study methods of combining wheat harvesting with aphid eradication. Comrades from the farm also experimented with two methods in a piece of land: applying pesticides to the cotton plants and spraying. The results showed that more than 95 percent of the aphids in the treated cotton fields were killed. After the meeting, North China Farm cadres and Special District cadres organized four working groups to go to the countryside to lead farmers in eliminating insect pests.

    Furthermore, the Special District Office and the Prefectural Party Committee, in order to protect the growth of cotton seedlings and eliminate the cotton aphids that are currently appearing, issued an emergency directive on June 6th, calling on all counties to pay close attention, and to resolutely eliminate cotton insects wherever they occur. Every cadre should learn pest control methods so as to lead farmers in prevention and control at any time and any place, and to integrate this work with the summer harvest and sowing, extending it to every village. It is important to strengthen insect control intelligence, and to report any discoveries at any time, level by level, and to promptly organize forces to eliminate them. In order to take care of the difficulties in disaster-stricken villages, it is specifically pointed out that the county-level supply and marketing cooperatives should prepare a certain amount of tobacco and lime for farmers to purchase locally. At the same time, the North China Farm has loaned 100 sprayers to the Special District and allocated 30 boxes of DTL powder to cooperate with local methods for a large-scale elimination of aphids.

    治蚜保棉
    【本报讯】建屏专区之正定、获鹿、井陉、行唐、平山、灵寿等县大部地区，发生蚜虫，直接威胁棉苗的成长。正定有些棉苗已呈现卷叶和枯萎状态，有的已开始死亡。为预防虫害挽救已成活的三十五万亩苗棉，专署特于六月五日紧急召开了全专九个县和正定等四个农场的农业技术干部会议。华北农场推广科长杨清政等十三个同志，亦由石门赶来参加指导。崔民生专员亲自领导，研究结合麦收扑灭蚜虫的办法。农场同志并用农药沾棉棵和喷雾器两种办法在一块地里实验，施药棉田蚜虫即死掉百分之九十五以上。会后华农干部和专署干部组织了四个工作组，下乡领导农民消灭虫害。
    又讯：专署、地委为保护棉苗成长，消灭正在发生的棉蚜，特于六月六日发出紧急指示，号召各县高度注意，棉虫发生在那里，就要及时坚决消灭在那里。每个干部要学会治虫办法，以便随时随地领导农民防除，要普遍到村与夏收播种相结合。加强除虫情报，随时发现，随时逐级报告，及时组织力量消灭。为照顾灾区村困难，特指出各县推进社准备烟草、石灰各一部，以便供农民随地购买。同时华北农场已借给该专区喷雾器一百架，并分配得利斯粉三十箱，以便配合土办法大量消灭蚜虫。
