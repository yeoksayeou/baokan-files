Xinhua News Agency, Peiping, 26th: Reports from various sources: The movement to defend peace continues to unfold in many countries around the world. Italian representatives attending the World Peace Congress announced at a press conference on the 21st that the Italian Preparatory Committee for the World Peace Congress has been reorganized into the Italian Standing Committee for the Movement to Defend Peace. Nenni, General Secretary of the Socialist Party, said at the press conference that the Italian Movement to Defend Peace Committee fully supports the signature movement against the ratification of the North Atlantic Treaty. Nenni pointed out that this movement is one of the essential elements of the Italian people's struggle to defend peace. Sirui Ni, one of the leaders of the Italian Communist Party, then stated that since returning to Italy, the members of the Italian delegation to the World Congress for the Defense of Peace have organized more than 750 congresses in Italy in May to convey the significance and results of the Peace Congress to the people. Representatives of progressive groups in Norway and Norwegian representatives who attended the World Congress for the Defense of Peace in Paris have recently elected a preparatory committee to implement the program of the congress. Stad was elected as chairman of the committee, Professor Lunden as vice chairman, and Tideman Johannesson as secretary. In Cuba, Cuban Communist Party leader Marinello, Labor Federation General Secretary Puna, and Democratic Women's Federation Chairman Garcia, among 150 others, recently issued a joint statement calling on the Cuban people to convene a national congress in support of peace in July this year. "People's Spanish Newspaper," a newspaper run by Spanish republicans exiled in Mexico, published a statement by prominent Spanish republicans announcing the establishment of a committee for the movement to defend world peace. The statement strongly urged all Spanish republicans at home and abroad to support the resolutions of the World Congress for the Defense of Peace in Paris.
