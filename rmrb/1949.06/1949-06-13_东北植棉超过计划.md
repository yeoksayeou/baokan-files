Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 12th: This year, cotton planting in Northeast China reached 1.25 million mu, exceeding the original plan of the Northeast Administrative Committee by a quarter, and recovering to more than one-half of the highest cotton planting area in 1945 during the puppet Manchukuo rule. This is because the Northeast Administrative Committee issued regulations on cotton planting rewards this spring, helped cotton farmers solve the problem of seed difficulties, and the local people's governments issued 30.06 million catties of pre-purchased grain. At present, the cotton fields in the two provinces of Liaodong and Liaoxi, which account for 94% of the total cotton planting area in Northeast China, generally have strong cotton seedlings, and have all completed the first hoeing. Some have even started the second hoeing. If there are no special disasters, it is expected to produce 18,700 tons of cotton.

　　东北植棉超过计划
    【新华社沈阳十二日电】东北今年植棉达一百二十五万亩，超过东北行政委员会原订计划四分之一，恢复到伪满统治时一九四五年最高植棉面积的二分之一以上。这是由于东北行政委员会今春发布了植棉奖励条例，帮助棉农解决了籽种困难，各地人民政府又发放了预购粮达三千零六十万斤的结果。现占全东北植棉面积百分之九十四以上的辽东、辽西两省棉田，一般棉苗茁壮，并已全部铲完头遍，部分且已开始铲二遍，如无特殊灾害，预计可产棉一万八千七百吨。
