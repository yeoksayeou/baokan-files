Xinhua News Agency, Prague, June 29th: On the eve of the opening of the Second Congress of the World Federation of Trade Unions, the Chinese delegation, having arrived in Prague more than ten days ago, is still unable to enter Italy due to the Italian reactionary government's refusal to issue entry visas. Other delegations encountering similar unreasonable obstruction and unable to go to Italy, as of the time of this dispatch, include those from India, Indonesia, and Mongolia. The Asian delegations gathered here believe that no matter how the imperialists and their lackeys in Italy obstruct, the solidarity of the world working class and its struggle for peace and democracy are irresistible.

　　On the 26th, at a discussion meeting of fraternal delegations from Asian countries initiated by Liu Ningyi, head of the Chinese delegation, representatives from India, Vietnam, Indonesia, and Mongolia warmly exchanged experiences in the workers' movement. An Indian representative said: "There are only two paths before the Asian people: one is the path taken by Mao Zedong, and the other is the path taken by Chiang Kai-shek. I believe that the people will resolutely take the former path." After careful discussion, they unanimously agreed with the draft report on the Asian workers' movement prepared by Liu Ningyi for the Milan Congress and expressed their willingness to actively participate in the preparatory work for the Asian Workers' Congress to be held by the World Federation of Trade Unions in Beiping this November. Liu Ningyi's draft report, the Chinese delegation's proposals, and the gifts and congratulatory messages from the Chinese working class to the World Federation of Trade Unions Congress have all been submitted to the Congress and will be read out by the Congress Secretariat on their behalf.

　　The working classes of all countries are very concerned about the Chinese delegation. The founding congress of the Textile Workers' Trade Union Department of the World Federation of Trade Unions sent a telegram to the Chinese delegation to express condolences. The telegram stated: The congress unanimously expressed indignation at the French government's refusal to issue entry visas. A seat on the executive committee of the trade union department remains reserved for China. For the past ten days, the Chinese delegation has been warmly received by the Czechoslovak government and trade unions and has visited coal mines, machine factories, tractor stations, and workers' sanatoriums. Currently, fraternal trade unions in Hungary, Poland, and other countries have invited them to visit their countries. It is reported that the Chinese delegation plans to depart for Hungary in early July. Before leaving, they will host a reception for people from all walks of life and reporters to thank the Czechoslovak government and working-class brothers for their lofty friendship and to read out a protest against the Italian reactionary government.

    亚洲各国被阻入境代表团指出：帝国主义走卒无法阻挠世界工人的团结
    【新华社布拉格二十九日电】在世界工联第二届代表大会开幕前夕，到达捷京已逾十日的中国代表团，因意大利反动政府拒发入境签证，仍未能进入意境。其他遭遇此种无理阻挠而未能去意大利者，至发电时止，尚有印度、印度尼西亚及蒙古等国的代表团。汇集此地的亚洲各国代表团认为：不管帝国主义者及其在意大利的走卒们怎样阻挠，世界工人阶级的团结及其为和平民主事业的斗争是不可抗拒的。
    二十六日，在中国代表团团长刘宁一所发起的亚洲各国兄弟代表团的谈话会上，印度、越南、印度尼亚西及蒙古的代表们，亲切地交换了工人运动的经验。一位印度代表说：“摆在亚洲人民面前的，只有两条道路：一条是毛泽东所走的道路，一条是蒋介石所走的道路。我相信：人民将坚决走前面的一条道路。”经过仔细的研讨以后，他们一致同意刘宁一所拟向米兰代表大会所作关于亚洲工人运动的报告草案，并愿积极参加世界工联将于今年十一月在北平召开的亚洲工人代表大会的筹备工作。刘宁一的报告草案、中国代表团的提案以及中国工人阶级献给世界工联代表大会的礼物、祝词等，已全部送交大会，将由大会秘书处代为宣读。
    各国工人阶级对中国代表团十分关切。世界工联纺织工人职工部成立大会致电中国代表团慰问。电中说：大会对法政府的拒发入境签证，一致表示愤激。在该职工部执行委员会中，仍有一席保留给中国代表。十天以来，中国代表团在捷克斯洛伐克政府及职工会的热情招待下，曾参观了煤矿、机器制造厂、拖拉机站及工人休养所等。目前匈、波等国的兄弟职工会，又邀请他们前往该国参观。闻中国代表团拟于七月初首途赴匈牙利，行前将招待各界及记者，答谢捷克斯洛伐克政府及工人阶级兄弟的崇高友谊，并宣读对意大利反动政府的抗议书。
