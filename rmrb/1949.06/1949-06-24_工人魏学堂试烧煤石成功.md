    Worker Wei Xuetang Successfully Experiments with Burning Coal Stone
    [Shijiazhuang Electric] Wei Xuetang, a stoker at the water supply station of the Railway Bureau's locomotive depot, has successfully researched and experimented with burning coal stone. Coal stone is impure coal with stony properties found above coal seams, and it was previously considered unburnable. However, after Wei's patient experiments, he discovered that coal stone not only has the same heating power as ordinary coal but is also more durable. On the 5th of this month, he reported his research results, and after inspection and trial burning by the leadership, the results were excellent. He was immediately commended, and other boilers were called upon to learn from him. The burning method is as follows: first, smash the coal stone into pieces the size of a fist and add them to the bottom of the furnace when the fire is strong, along with crushed coal, and cover the flames tightly. However, the amount added each time should be twice as much as the coal (i.e., three shovels of coal, six shovels of coal stone). One addition of coal stone can burn for the time it takes to add coal twice before turning into white ash. The following points should be noted when burning coal stone: (1) Coal stone that is blue in color and particularly heavy, indicating that it contains too little coal, cannot be used; coal stone that has weathered through the summer cannot be used either. (2) Because coal stone contains impurities, it must be burned alternately with good coal and cannot be used exclusively. It is best not to use coal stone when the boiler is needed urgently. (3) When adding to the furnace, it should be done after "clearing the bottom," when the fire bottom is about three inches thick. After burning for two or three hours, when the fire bottom is too thick, coal stone can no longer be burned. (4) When burning coal stone, it is necessary to poke it frequently, otherwise, the fire will not be strong. Currently, four boilers at the water supply station are burning coal stone. According to statistics, from the 13th to the 23rd, a total of 51 small carts of coal stone were burned in eleven days, saving 6,120 kilograms of coal.

    工人魏学堂试烧煤石成功
    【石家庄电】铁路局机务段给水所司炉工人魏学堂研究烧煤石成功。按煤石是煤层上面有石性的不纯煤，从前都认为不能烧，魏耐心试验结果，发现煤石不仅火力不次于普通煤，且较普通煤耐烧。本月五日他将研究成绩汇报后，经领导上检查试烧，结果良好，当即给予表扬，并号召其它锅炉学习。烧法是：先将煤石砸成拳头大小的碎块，于火旺时添入炉底，同时配以碎煤，盖严火苗。但每次添的数量要比煤多一倍（即煤添三锹，煤石六锹）。煤石添一次可烧添两次煤的时间，方能烧成白灰。烧煤石时须注意几点：（１）煤石中颜色发青比煤特别重者，含煤的成份过少，不能用；经过夏天风化的煤石也不能用。（２）煤石因含杂质，须与好煤轮流烧，不能专用它。遇急用锅炉时最好不用煤石。（３）上炉须于“清底”后，火底厚三寸许时，烧至二、三小时后火底太厚，即不能再烧煤石。（４）烧煤石时要常通，否则火就不旺。现给水所已有四个锅炉烧煤石。据统计，从十三日至二十三日十一天内，共烧煤石五十一小车，可节约煤六千一百二十公斤。
