  　Chongming People Welcome the People's Liberation Army
    [Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 14th] The people of Baozhen, Chongming, enthusiastically welcome the People's Liberation Army. When the PLA landed there on May 31, a worker immediately ran up, grabbed a PLA soldier's hand, and said, "We've been setting up secret哨哨哨 for over ten days, waiting for you to come!" He then led the PLA into Baozhen. The town was plastered with slogans welcoming the PLA. Students from North Bao Middle School immediately distributed pre-printed songs such as "Welcome the PLA." The sound of firecrackers and cheers rose and fell around the PLA ranks. The workers of Datong Yarn Factory at the port continued to work while selecting representatives to participate in the welcome. People congratulated each other, saying, "This is truly a sunny day!" That day, many workers who had fled to avoid being conscripted by the puppet Jiangsu Provincial Government returned to the factory. The number of spindles operating at Ning'an Yarn Factory and Datong Yarn Factory immediately increased, with Datong Factory increasing from 12,000 spindles to 18,000 spindles. On the same day, five classes resumed at Minben Middle School on Chongming Island, and North Bao Middle School and several elementary schools all resumed classes. Shops operated as usual.

　　“这可晴天了！”
  　崇明人民欢迎解放军
    【新华社上海十四日电】崇明堡镇人民狂热欢迎人民解放军。当解放军于五月三十一日在该地登陆时，立即有一个工人飞跑前来，拉住解放军战士的手说：“我们放暗哨放了十几天，等着你们来啊！”说着即带着解放军进入堡镇。镇上贴满了欢迎解放军的标语，北堡中学学生们立即散发早已印好的“欢迎解放军”等歌曲，爆竹声和欢呼声在解放军行列前后左右起落。港口的大通纱厂的工人们一面继续作工，一面选出代表参加欢迎，人们相互道贺着：“这可晴天了！”当天，许多逃避伪江苏省府抓丁的工人都回到了工厂，宁安纱厂大通纱厂开工的锭数立刻增加，大通厂由一万二千锭增加到一万八千锭。崇明岛上的民本中学当天即有五班复课，北堡中学及几个小学全部复课，商店照常营业。
