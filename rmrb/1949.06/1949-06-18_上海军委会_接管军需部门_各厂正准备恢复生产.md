　　Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, June 17th: The takeover work by various receiving departments under the Shanghai Military Control Commission's Military Takeover Committee has largely concluded its initial phase. The targets of the Military Takeover Committee mainly include the original Kuomintang Ministry of National Defense's directly affiliated sea, land, air, and combined logistics departments, agencies, and all their warehouses, barracks, materials, ships, equipment, etc. Key units include the puppet Navy's Shanghai Joint Logistics General Station, Jiangnan Shipyard, Hydrographic Office, puppet Air Force Supply Command, puppet Central Aviation Corporation, Aviation Industry Bureau, Air Force Oxygen Plant, and Jiangwan, Dachang, Longhua and other airports, puppet Joint Logistics Telecommunications Factory No. 2, puppet Joint Logistics Shanghai 10th Supply District Command, Third Ammunition Depot, Longhua Ordnance Repair Factory, Shanghai Clothing General Factory, Shanghai General Hospital, 501 Automobile Repair Factory, Armored Corps Command, puppet National Defense Medical College, and the puppet Shanghai Garrison District, etc. The committee is divided into six departments: Political Work, Navy, Army, Air Force, Logistics, and Training. They began carrying out the receiving work separately on May 27th. Based on the original materials, a preliminary understanding was conducted, and guard troops were dispatched to guard separately. Then, according to the circumstances, the entire set of receiving and inventory work was carried out from top to bottom according to the original system, without any changes. For more than half a month, with the efforts of the receiving personnel of various departments in abiding by policies and discipline, humbly learning, and carrying forward the fine traditions of hard work and plain living of the People's Liberation Army, and with the active assistance of the personnel of the original agencies and factories, especially the workers and citizens, the receiving work of various departments has been able to overcome difficulties and proceed smoothly according to plan. Currently, the various receiving departments under the committee, in addition to continuing to conduct investigations and research to prevent materials from escaping and being concealed, and continuing to handle a small portion of receiving matters, are preparing to have the received factories resume production in a planned manner, and to further concentrate and organize all the received materials, categorize them, and carry out detailed inventory and management.
