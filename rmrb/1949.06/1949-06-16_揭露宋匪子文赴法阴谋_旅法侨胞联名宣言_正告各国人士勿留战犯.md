    [Xinhua News Agency, Prague, 15th] Li Fengbai, Wang Ziqing, Chen Yuhou, Chen Yaoming, Cai Fugao, Wu Xinmou, Wu Zhaozhi and other 284 overseas Chinese in France recently jointly issued a declaration denouncing the war criminal Song Ziwen for engaging in conspiratorial activities in France. The declaration revealed that the bandit Song's visit to Europe had two missions: (1) to purchase arms and continue to slaughter the Chinese people, and (2) to plot and sign the so-called Pacific Pact. The declaration proposed that the war criminal Song Ziwen must be arrested and handed over to the people's court for trial in order to uphold the law of the country. The declaration said: "We live overseas, and it is already a great regret that we have not personally participated in the great people's revolution. If we turn a blind eye to the arrival of the war criminal Song Ziwen and allow him to act recklessly, we will not only be sorry for our conscience, but also for the people of the country." The declaration called on patriotic overseas Chinese in various places to unite, expose the crimes of the bandit Song, and solemnly warn people from all countries not to allow criminals against the people to reside [in their countries]. According to the Paris Overseas Chinese Times, the number of patriotic overseas Chinese signing the declaration is constantly increasing.
