　　Liao Chengzhi, representative of the All-China Federation of Democratic Youth, said:
    The convocation of the preparatory meeting for the New Political Consultative Conference is an epoch-making event. There is no doubt that the youth of the whole country are concerned about this preparatory meeting. Today, we are able to prepare for the convocation of the New Political Consultative Conference here thanks to the wise leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, the heroic fighting of the People's Liberation Army, and the joint efforts of the people of the whole country. But do not forget that more than 80 percent of the People's Liberation Army are young people. In the future, the construction of the new democratic New China will largely fall on the shoulders of our young people, which is very glorious. We must give millions of young workers the opportunity to be educated and liberate them from the feudal and imperialist enslavement education. We should help young workers improve their production technology in various production institutions and guarantee their lives. Young scientific workers can also contribute their strength to the construction of the new China in the future as much as possible. We young people standing at various work posts should work hard and strengthen our study to celebrate the convocation of the New Political Consultative Conference.
    Today, the unprecedented unity is demonstrated at the meeting, which is the common unity of all democratic parties in opposing imperialism, bureaucratic capitalism, and feudalism. This is a model of unity, and our national democratic youth should learn from this political consultative conference and carry forward this spirit.
    From the comparison between the old and new political consultative conferences, the convocation of the old political consultative conference was equivalent to announcing to the people of China who was right and who was wrong: who was truly for peace and who was falsely for peace. The New Political Consultative Conference is convened entirely by the Chinese people and does not include reactionaries. Every word it says represents the people and is to be realized. Different opinions from various democratic parties and progressive classes are brought to consultation through political consultation to reach a consensus.
    I celebrate the success of this political consultative conference.

　　中华全国民主青年联合总会代表廖承志说：
    新政协筹备会的召开，是一件划时代的事情。全国青年对这次新政协筹备会的关切，是毫无疑问的。今天我们所以能在这里筹备召开新政协，这是由于中国共产党和毛主席的英明领导，和人民解放军的英勇善战，以及全国人民的共同努力。但是不要忘记，在人民解放军里面，有百分之八十以上都是青年。今后新民主主义新中国的建设事业，大部分也要落在我们青年的肩膀上，这是非常光荣的。我们要使千百万的劳动青年有受教育的机会，把他们从封建的帝国主义的奴化教育中解放出来。我们应该帮助青年工人从各种生产机构上提高他们的生产技术，保障他们的生活。青年的科学工作者，今后也可以尽量地为新中国的建设事业来贡献他们的力量。我们站在各个工作岗位上的青年，都要努力工作，加强学习，来庆祝新政协的召开。
    今天，在大会上表现了从来没有的团结，这是各民主党派在反对帝国主义、官僚资本主义、封建主义的共同团结。这是一个团结的模范，我们全国民主青年应该向这次政协学习，并发扬这种精神。
    从新旧政协的对比上来看，旧政协的召开，等于向全中国人民宣布了谁是谁非：谁是真和平，谁是假和平。新政协是完全由中国人民召开的，是不包括反动派在内的，他的每一句话，都是代表人民的，都是要实现的。用政治协商的方式把各民主党派进步阶层的各种不同的意见带来协商，取得一致。
    我庆祝这次政协的成功。
