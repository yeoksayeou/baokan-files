　　Continue to Develop On-the-Job Cadre Learning
　　Since the North China Bureau issued the "Decision on On-the-Job Cadre Education" last year, on-the-job cadres in various regions have gradually established formal theoretical and cultural learning systems and have achieved considerable success. The various organs at the level of the North China Bureau have established formal amateur schools for government offices. According to preliminary statistics, the North China Bureau's amateur schools have 247 people participating in cultural classes and 126 people participating in theoretical learning. The North China People's Government's amateur schools have a main school and nine branch schools, with more than 2,000 cadres engaged in formal learning. Various regions, such as JiZhong, have issued instructions suitable for their local conditions in accordance with the spirit of the North China Bureau's instructions and have effectively organized the learning of the district party committee-level organs. According to statistics from the JiZhong District alone, 1,533 cadres participated in learning in the five amateur schools formed by the district party committee, administrative office, and directly affiliated organs. Intermediate and above-level cadres, in studying a brief history of social development, understood that "history is the history of the working people, and the working people are the true heirs of history," and clarified the "essence of class society and class struggle," thereby further establishing the belief that "the people's cause is bound to win." Before entering the city, some organs at the North China Bureau level also organized the study of urban policies. After entering Peiping and Tianjin, cadres at all levels were generally able to implement and execute urban policies in accordance with the Party's policies and paid attention to promptly requesting instructions on newly occurring issues. In terms of cultural learning, the intermediate cultural classes in various regions paid attention to learning composition, and the Chinese language, arithmetic, and other courses taught in the elementary cultural classes enabled some cadres and odd-job workers with low levels of education to make great progress. For example, Comrade Yang Zhengxing of the North China Bureau could only recognize his own name in the past, but after two months of cultural learning, he could recognize 149 new characters. In the past, he did not know how to calculate, but now he has learned addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Zhao Gengxin, who is over forty years old, also knew very few characters in the past, but after two months, he could roughly read the Ta Chung Pao.
　　The main reasons for achieving these results are the following four points: First, the in-depth mobilization of learning. The North China Bureau's "Decision on On-the-Job Cadre Education" played a significant role in promoting this. Facts have proved that as long as the leadership clearly explains the importance of learning, very few of our cadres are unwilling to participate in learning or are willing to fall behind. Everyone's desire to improve and serve the people better is extremely urgent. Second, most regions can regard leading learning as part of the overall leadership work. For example, when the JiLuYu Third Military Sub-district organized learning, Comrade Yu, the deputy commander of the organ, personally served as the leader of the learning group. Facts have proved that the soundness of the learning leadership is very important. Some of the leadership learning during this period adopted the system of learning committees, while others adopted the principal responsibility system with the leader in charge. Although these two forms are different, the key to the problem lies in the leadership's continuous inspection and timely resolution of difficulties in the advancement, such as adjusting the time, assigning teachers, and organizing the teaching force. Only in this way can learning be implemented and persisted; otherwise, it is easy to abort halfway. Third, a certain system has been established: such as the organization of schools, regular classes, leave, roll call, regular examinations, occasional quizzes, and organization of discussions. The establishment of these systems plays a significant role in ensuring learning. Fourth, the study groups established based on the common nature of work or learning are the basic units of learning. Therefore, leadership over the groups should be strengthened, and regular joint meetings of group leaders should be held to exchange learning experiences. Administrative leaders of each unit, if they cannot also serve as learning group leaders, should also pay attention to being responsible for organizing learning.
　　What problems exist in the current learning? First, there is a problem of rigidly adhering to the literal meaning in theoretical learning, and when studying policies, one cannot break free from the circle of narrow experience. In response to this, the leadership should provide timely guidance to ensure that theoretical learning is well connected with the current reality, and at the same time, practical examples should be elevated to a comprehensive understanding. Second, some organs lack a long-term commitment to leading learning and often abandon leadership of learning due to the impact of temporary tasks. This situation is most difficult to deal with in organs below the county level. If the leadership does not have a firm determination, it is easily influenced by the surrounding environment. Third, learning, like work, requires an honest attitude. Demanding too much or too quickly, seeking only superficiality and not depth, will not yield good results.
　　The situation is developing rapidly, and the newly liberated areas are expanding day by day, and the task of construction is becoming more arduous. Therefore, our cadres must be improved theoretically and ideologically. For example, cadres working in many small and medium-sized cities in North China, after studying the news of the Second Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and clarifying the viewpoint of relying on the working class to develop production, began to correct the deviation of neglecting the work of workers. Therefore, each organ should, in accordance with the spirit of the North China Bureau's instructions and in accordance with the current situation and needs, conduct an in-depth inspection on the one hand and arrange for the study of theory and policies, especially economic construction policies, on the other hand. Those that have been suspended should be quickly organized to resume, and those that have not been suspended should summarize their experiences and improve them. The main key still lies in the responsible comrades at all levels conscientiously and relentlessly strengthening leadership over cadre learning.

### 继续开展在职干部学习

　　继续开展在职干部学习
    自去年华北局发出“在职干部教育决定”后，各地在职干部均逐渐建立了正规的理论与文化学习制度，并获得相当成绩。华北局一级的各机关，均设立了正规的机关业余学校。华北局底业余学校，经初步的统计，参加文化班学习的有二百四十七人，参加理论学习的一百二十六人。华北人民政府机关业余学校里，设有总校及九个分校，共有二千余干部投入正规学习。冀中等各地区，均依据华北局指示的精神，发出了适合于本地具体情况的指示，并切实组织了区党委一级机关的学习。仅据冀中区的统计：区党委、行署及各直属机关组成的五个业余学校中，有干部一千五百三十三人参加学习。中级以上干部在学习社会发展简史中，懂得了“历史都是劳动人民的历史，劳动人民才是历史的正统”，明确了“阶级社会和阶级斗争的实质”，从而进一步树立了“人民事业必然胜利”的信念。入城前，华北局一级的机关中，有的并组织了城市政策的学习，进入平、津后，各级干部在掌握城市政策方面，一般的都能依据党的政策贯彻执行，并注意了在新发生的问题上，随时请示。在文化学习方面，各地的中级文化班，都注意学习作文，初级文化班所教授的国文、算术等课，使一些原来文化程度很低的干部和勤杂人员等，都有了很大的进步。如华北局杨正兴同志过去只能识自己的名字，经两月的文化学习后，已认识一百四十九个生字了；过去不知道算法，现在都学会了加、减、乘、除。四十多岁的赵更新，过去也识字很少，两个月后，他已粗略的能看大众报了。
    获得这些成绩的原因，最主要的有下列四点：第一、学习动员的深入，华北局的“在职干部教育决定”推动作用很大。事实证明，只要领导上认真将学习的重要性讲清楚，我们干部很少有不愿参加学习或宁肯落后的。大家要求提高，更好为人民服务的思想是十分急切的。第二、多数地区均能将领导学习当成整个领导工作的一部分，如冀鲁豫第三军分区在组织学习时，该机关余副司令员即亲任学习组长。事实证明，学习领导的健全与否，关系很大。这段领导学习中有的采取了学委会的制度，有的采取了首长负责的校长制。这两种形式虽有不同，但问题的关键，都决定于领导上的随时检查并及时解决前进中的困难，如时间的调整，教员的分配，教员力量的组织等。只有这样，学习才能贯彻与坚持下去，否则很易中途流产。第三、建立了一定的制度：如学校的组织、定期上课、请假、点名、定期考试、临时测验、组织讨论等。这些制度的建立，在保证学习上，起作用很大。第四、依据工作或学习的共同性质所建立的学习小组，是学习的基本单位。因此应加强对小组的领导，要举行定期的组长联席会议，互相交换学习经验。各单位的行政负责人，如不能兼任学习组长，也应注意对组织学习负责。
    目前的学习中存在着一些什么问题呢？第一、理论学习中有死扣字句的毛病，学习政策时又打不开狭隘经验的圈子，对此，领导上应及时地加以诱导，使理论学习很好地联系眼前的实际，同时又要把实际的事例提高到全面理解。第二，部分机关在学习领导上缺乏长期坚持的精神，常常为临时的任务影响而放弃对学习的领导。这种情况在县以下的机关最难处理，如果领导上没有坚持的决心，很容易为周围的环境所影响。第三、学习和工作一样，都需要老老实实的态度，要求过高或要求过快，只求表面不求深入，都是不会有很好收获的。
    形势发展很快，新解放的地区一天天扩大，建设的任务又是益加艰巨，因之，我们的干部必须从理论上思想上加以提高。如华北许多中小城市工作干部，因学习了中共中央二中全会的新闻，明确了依靠工人阶级发展生产等的观点，才开始纠正了忽视工人工作的偏向。所以，各机关即应依据华北局指示的精神，根据目前的形势与需要，一面深入检查，一面布置理论与政策、特别是经济建设的政策学习；已停顿了的要迅速组织恢复，未停顿的要总结经验，加以提高，主要关键，还在于各级负责同志对干部学习，认真地与毫不松懈地加强领导。
