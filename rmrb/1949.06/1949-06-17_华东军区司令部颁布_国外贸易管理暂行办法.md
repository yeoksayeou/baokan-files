Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 16th: The East China Military Region Headquarters of the Chinese People's Liberation Army promulgated the "Provisional Measures for Foreign Trade Management in the East China Region" on the 6th, which came into effect immediately. The general principles of the measures state that their formulation is "to promote exports, manage imports, develop production, and prosper the economy," and that "matters concerning foreign trade management shall be executed by the Foreign Trade Administration and its affiliated institutions."

The measures stipulate: "All domestic merchants engaged in import and export business must apply to the Foreign Trade Administration or its branches for approval and obtain an import and export trade business license." "All foreign merchants or representatives of foreign commercial institutions who are willing to engage in import and export trade with our country and abide by the laws and decrees of the People's Government, regardless of whether their business is permanent or temporary in nature, must apply to the Foreign Trade Administration or its branches for approval through the introduction of the People's Government's Foreign Affairs Office and obtain an import and export trade business license before they can engage in business." "If import and export merchants are found to have engaged in illegal or fraudulent activities, in addition to the illegal part being handled by the judicial authorities, the Foreign Trade Administration or its branches may, depending on the seriousness of the circumstances, issue warnings or revoke their business licenses."

Regarding export trade, the measures stipulate that export goods are divided into three categories: those permitted for export may be freely exported by the exporter; those requiring special permission for export shall be exported after applying for a special export permit; and goods prohibited from export shall not be exported without special permission from the People's Government. "Exporters exporting goods (including exports and re-exports) shall sign an export foreign exchange transfer certificate with the designated bank and declare the export with the certificate. After the customs stamps the foreign exchange transfer certificate, it shall be submitted to the designated bank to transfer the foreign exchange (or letter of credit) to the Bank of China in exchange for a foreign exchange deposit certificate." "If exporters need to export goods on a consignment basis due to factual needs, they must obtain approval from the Foreign Trade Administration or its branches before they can export. In addition to signing an export foreign exchange transfer certificate with the designated bank, they must also obtain a guarantee from the designated foreign exchange bank and deposit the foreign exchange into the Bank of China within the specified period in exchange for a foreign exchange deposit certificate." "Donations, advertising materials, and samples to foreign countries that are not commercial in nature, with a total value of less than 20,000 RMB, may be exempted from the above-mentioned procedures after verification by the customs."

Regarding import trade, the measures stipulate: "Importers must apply to the Foreign Trade Administration or its branches for an import license before ordering goods from foreign countries." Imported goods are also divided into three categories: those permitted for import may be imported by the importer holding an import license and purchasing a foreign exchange deposit certificate in the designated foreign exchange market or importing with their own foreign exchange; those requiring special permission for import shall be imported by the state-owned foreign trade company applying for a special import permit; and those prohibited from import shall not be imported without special permission from the People's Government. The Foreign Trade Administration may announce and modify the three categories of goods that are freely, specially permitted, and prohibited from import and export at any time as needed. "Foreign donations, advertising materials, and samples that are not commercial in nature, with a total value of less than 20,000 RMB, shall be allowed to be imported after verification by the customs; however, this shall not apply to the import of goods prohibited from import."

The measures also stipulate: "If import and export merchants wish to conduct import and export trade by means of barter, they must obtain a barter certificate with the special permission of the Foreign Trade Administration or its branches before they can proceed."

The measures are also accompanied by a list of import and export goods, listing the various goods permitted, specially permitted, and prohibited from import and export.
