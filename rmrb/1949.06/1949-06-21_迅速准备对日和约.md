    Hasten Preparations for a Peace Treaty with Japan
    As the United States government continues to adopt a policy of division on the German question and a policy of protection towards the Japanese aggressive forces, the Chinese people cannot but be even more seriously alarmed by the American conspiracy to delay preparations for a peace treaty with Japan and to occupy Japan for a long time. This agency has previously reported several times on the American plan for a long-term occupation of Japan. Recently, because the U.S. Secretary of State openly refused to convene a meeting of the four foreign ministers, including China, to discuss the preparation of a peace treaty with Japan at the Paris Foreign Ministers' Conference, the attention of all parties in China to the U.S. Far Eastern diplomatic conspiracy has greatly increased. According to a Shanghai dispatch from this agency on the 19th, Vanne, the head of the expert group of MacArthur's headquarters, sent a statement to the U.S. State Department on the 4th of this month, explaining MacArthur's American policy in Japan. After acknowledging that the American imperialist policy had suffered bankruptcy in China, the statement once again put forward the proposition that "the term of occupation of Japan should be extended as much as possible."
    The U.S. government has consistently adopted an extremely selfish and reactionary position on the issue of a peace treaty with Japan. The U.S. government violated the international agreement stipulated by the Potsdam Agreement that the peace treaty with Japan should be prepared by the Council of Foreign Ministers. On July 11, 1947, it made a unilateral decision, announcing that the eleven countries participating in the Far Eastern Commission would hold a preliminary meeting on the peace treaty with Japan on August 19 of the same year, attempting to replace the Four Foreign Ministers' Conference and the principle of unanimous agreement among the great powers with the eleven-nation conference and the method of majority voting, so as to force the Soviet Union and other countries to accept the U.S. monopolistic policy towards Japan, thereby giving this policy a legitimate status. However, this conspiracy of the U.S. government failed under the resolute opposition of the Soviet government and the people of Eastern countries harmed by the Japanese invaders. Since then, the U.S. government has been adopting a policy of procrastination and inaction on the issue of a peace treaty with Japan, and now it simply uses the excuse that "the peace treaty with Japan is a complex issue" (Acheson's words) and adopts an arrogant attitude of putting it on the shelf.
    The U.S. government's intolerable position on the issue of a peace treaty with Japan is based on the U.S.'s established policy of implementing imperialism in Japan after the war. This established policy is determined to dominate Japan exclusively, to turn Japan into an important accomplice and main base for U.S. imperialism to carry out aggressive adventures in the Far East, and to turn it into a colony for U.S. monopoly capital to extract super profits. The American occupation authorities in Japan have admitted this without any concealment. When MacArthur met with a reporter from the British Daily Mail on March 1, he openly said: "The Pacific has now become a Saxon lake. The Philippines, the Ryukyus, and Japan have become the vanguard line of the United States. Japan has become a stronghold of interests that the United States and Britain should maintain. It is very easy to recruit troops in Japan to cooperate with us." The aforementioned Vanne, in his statement to the State Department, even openly advocated: "Under the current conditions, Japan should play the role of the main ally of the United States in the Far East. Japanese territory should be used as the main land, sea, and air force base of the United States in the Far East. The United States should prepare everything in this direction so that Japan can become a de facto ally of the United States as soon as possible." In the economic field, the statement strongly agrees with MacArthur's measures to make full use of Japan's production equipment and cheap labor, and to drastically increase Japan's exports of everything, in order to save the United States' "declining reputation in Asia." In order to realize this reactionary policy, American imperialism has already taken many steps unilaterally, such as releasing war criminals, preserving the zaibatsu, and supporting reactionary forces. Recently, it has intensified its illegal actions even more. The main ones are: (1) The U.S. government unilaterally announced on May 12 that it had decided to cancel the Japanese interim reparations plan and terminate any Japanese reparations. The U.S. State Department issued a statement on June 10, reiterating its position of canceling Japanese reparations; (2) Under MacArthur's instructions, the Japanese House of Representatives passed a bill to expand the police force on May 16. Everyone knows that the American occupiers are secretly training and equipping the Japanese army under the guise of expanding the police force; (3) U.S. monopoly capital is pouring into Japan under the so-called Nine-Point Plan for stabilizing the Japanese economy promulgated last December, controlling all important Japanese industries and export trade. U.S. monopoly capital is turning Japan into an American factory, using American raw materials and cheap Japanese labor to manufacture goods for it, and then exporting these goods to Southeast Asia, Central and South America, and Western European countries. U.S. monopoly capital has thereby extracted double profits, as high as 300% to 1100%; (4) MacArthur's headquarters has recently been more frantically suppressing the Japanese people's democratic movement, instigating the Japanese House of Representatives to pass a new labor law that deprives Japanese workers of their rights, passed the "National University Law" and the "Teacher Qualification Examination Law" that prohibit academic freedom for students and teachers, and is preparing to pass a "New Public Security Law" against the people's right to demonstrate and hold public gatherings. MacArthur's headquarters condoned the Japanese police's killing of Hashimoto Kinjiro, a streetcar worker who participated in a demonstration against the "New Public Security Law" on May 29. On May 19, June 6, and June 11, MacArthur's headquarters openly intervened and prohibited the strikes of Japanese coal miners, Tokyo streetcar workers, and Tokyo and Kanagawa Prefecture electric railway workers.
    Isn't it clear that the U.S. government's imperialist policy towards Japan and its various practical actions directly threaten peace and security in the Far East, directly violate the Potsdam Proclamation and the rights of countries at war with Japan, and directly undermine the development of Japan's independence, democracy, and peaceful economy?
    The Chinese people have resolutely opposed this sinister U.S. policy towards Japan, and will continue to oppose it to the end. The Chinese people, who have suffered the most from Japanese寇 (Kou, meaning invaders, enemy) disasters and made the greatest sacrifices, have every right to demand that a four-nation peace treaty preparation conference be held immediately on schedule, in accordance with the principles of the Potsdam Agreement and other international agreements, with the full-fledged representatives of the People's Democratic New China participating, to formulate a peace treaty with Japan that eradicates Japanese militarism and realizes Japanese democratization. Similarly, the Chinese people have every right to declare illegal the U.S.'s unilateral decisions over the past four years to release war criminals, stop reparations, and preserve the zaibatsu, in violation of international agreements.
    The great victory of the Chinese People's Liberation War has completely changed the face of Asia. Any attempt by imperialists to disregard the voices of the Chinese people will continue to commit serious mistakes and continue to suffer the shameful failures they have already suffered in China. Whether or not U.S. imperialism is willing, the Chinese people, together with the people of all countries in the world headed by the Soviet Union, together with the people of the Far East, and together with the increasingly powerful democratic forces of Japan, will surely defeat the reactionary policy of the U.S. imperialists towards Japan, will surely strive to help the democratization of Japan, and will surely fight for lasting peace in the Far East and the world!

### 迅速准备对日和约

    迅速准备对日和约
    当美国政府在德国问题上继续采取分裂政策，并对日本侵略势力采取保护政策的时候，中国人民不能不更加严重地警惕美国拖延准备对日和约和长期占领日本的阴谋。关于美国长期占领日本的计划，本社前此已曾迭次报道。最近由于美国国务卿在巴黎外长会议上，公然托辞拒绝召开包括中国在内的四国外长会议讨论准备对日和约问题，中国各方对美国远东外交阴谋的注意大大加强了。据本社十九日上海消息，麦克阿瑟总部的专家团团长范恩于本月四日致美国国务院说明书一份，为麦克阿瑟的美国在日政策进行解释。该说明书在承认美国帝国主义政策已在中国遭受破产以后，又一次提出了“占领日本的期限应尽量延长”的主张。
    美国政府对于对日和约问题，一贯采取着极端自私和反动的立场。美国政府违反波茨坦协议所规定对日和约应由外长会议准备的国际协定，曾于一九四七年七月十一日作出片面决定，宣布由参加远东委员会的十一国于同年八月十九日举行对日和约初步会议，企图以十一国会议和多数表决的方法，来代替四外长会议和强国一致协议的原则，来压迫苏联等国接受美国对日本的独占政策，从而使这个政策取得合法的地位。但是，美国政府的这一阴谋，在苏联政府及受日寇侵害的东方各国人民的坚决反对下失败了。从此以后，美国政府对于对日和约问题，就一直采取拖延和怠工的政策，现在则索性借口“对日和约是一个复杂问题”（艾奇逊语）而抱着置之高阁的专横态度了。
    美国政府在对日和约问题上所采取的令人不能容忍的立场，是以美国战后在日本施行帝国主义的既定政策作为基础的。这个既定政策确定要独霸日本，要把日本变成美帝国主义在远东进行侵略冒险的重要帮凶和主要基地，变成美国独占资本榨取超额利润的殖民地。美国驻日占领当局对这件事已毫无掩饰地加以承认。麦克阿瑟在三月一日接见英国每日邮报记者时，曾公开地说：“太平洋目前已变成萨克逊湖，菲律宾、琉球、日本，已成为美国的前卫线，日本已成为美英应保有之权益据点，在日本募集与吾人合作的军队，至为容易。”上引范恩在致国务院的说明书中，更公然主张：“在目前条件下，日本在远东应起美国主要同盟者的作用。日本领土应被用作美国在远东主要的陆海空军基地。美国一切都应向着这个方向准备，以便日本尽快地成为美国的实际同盟者。”在经济方面，该说明书极力赞同麦克阿瑟尽量利用日本的生产设备与廉价劳动力，激烈增加日本输出的一切措施，以便挽救美国“在亚洲正在低落的声望”。美国帝国主义为了实现这一反动政策，早已片面地采取了释放战犯，保存财阀，扶植反动势力等许多步骤。最近则更变本加厉地采取一系列的非法行动。其中主要的有：（一）美国政府于五月十二日片面地宣布美国政府已决定取消日本临时赔偿计划，并终止日本任何的赔偿。美国国务院又于六月十日发表声明，重申其取消日本赔偿的立场；（二）在麦克阿瑟的指使下，日本众院于五月十六日通过扩充警察法案。尽人皆知，美国占领者正是在扩充警察的外衣下，秘密训练与装备着日本军队；（三）美国独占资本在去年十二月颁布的所谓九点稳定日本经济计划之下，正源源涌入日本，控制着日本的一切重要工业与出口贸易。美国独占资本正把日本变成美国的工厂，利用美国的原料与日本的便宜劳动力来给它制造商品，然后再把这些商品输出到东南亚、中南美与西欧各国去。美国独占资本由此榨取了双重的利润，高达百分之三百到百分之一千一百；（四）麦克阿瑟总部最近更加疯狂地镇压日本人民的民主运动，嗾使日本众院通过了剥夺日本劳工权利的新劳工法，通过了禁止学生与教员学术自由的“国立大学法”与“教员资格审查法”，并正在准备通过反对人民示威与公共集会权利的“新治安法”。麦克阿瑟总部纵容日本警察于五月二十九日残杀参加反“新治安法”示威的电车工人桥本金次郎。五月十九日、六月六日及六月十一日麦克阿瑟总部公开出面干涉，禁止了日本煤矿工人、东京电车工人及东京与神奈川县电气铁道工人的罢工。
    美国政府这种帝国主义的对日政策，及其各种实际行动，直接威胁着远东的和平与安全，直接违反着波茨坦公告和对日作战国家的权利，直接破坏着日本的独立、民主与和平经济的发展，这难道还不明白吗？
    中国人民曾坚决反对美国的这种罪恶的对日政策，而且将继续反对到底。蒙受日寇祸害最深和牺牲最大的中国人民，有充分权利要求立即按照波茨坦协议等国际协定的原则，迅速地定期举行有人民民主新中国全权代表参加的四国对日和约准备会议，拟定肃清日本军国主义和实现日本民主化的对日和约。同样，中国人民有充分权利对美国四年来历次违背国际协定所实行的释放战犯、停止赔偿、保存财阀等等片面决定，宣布为非法。
    中国人民解放战争的伟大胜利，已完全改变了亚洲的面貌。帝国主义者任何轻视中国人民呼声的企图，都将继续犯重大的错误，继续遭受象他们已经在中国所遭受的可耻的失败。不管美帝国主义愿意与否，中国人民和以苏联为首的世界各国人民一起，和远东人民一起，和日益强大的日本民主势力一起，一定要战胜美帝国主义者的反动的对日政策，一定要努力帮助日本的民主化，一定要为远东和世界的持久和平而奋斗！
