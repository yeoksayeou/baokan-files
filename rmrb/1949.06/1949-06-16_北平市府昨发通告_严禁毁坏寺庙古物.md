【Ping City News】The Peiping Municipal People's Government issued a notice yesterday (the 15th) to protect temples and antiquities, stating: It has been found that there are numerous temples in this city, with magnificent architecture, and many contain carvings, ritual implements, scriptures, and other valuable antiques of historical and cultural value, which are extremely precious. However, recently there have been unscrupulous elements who arbitrarily destroy temple buildings and steal temple antiques. The monks guarding the temples do not prevent or stop them, nor do they report them, and even sell them themselves, which is very wrong. From now on, all our citizens should cherish temple property and antiquities. The abbots of each temple should be held strictly responsible. If any loss or damage is discovered again, it will be investigated and dealt with severely.

　　北平市府昨发通告
  　严禁毁坏寺庙古物
    【平市讯】北平市人民政府为保护寺庙古物，昨（十五日）发出通告称：查本市寺庙林立，建筑宏伟，内中多有收藏富有历史文化价值的雕刻、法器、经典以及其他名贵古物，殊堪珍贵。乃近来屡有不良分子，任意摧毁寺庙建筑，偷窃寺庙古物。看守寺庙僧侣，不予防范阻止，亦不呈报，甚至自行盗卖等事情，殊属非是。今后凡我市民，对于寺庙财产古物，均应加以爱护。各寺住持，更应切实负责，倘再发现遗失损毁事情，一经查出，定予究办。
