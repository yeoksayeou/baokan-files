President Bierut's Speech at the Polish Trade Union Congress (Continued)
　　In the past four years, the labor masses organized within the trade unions have had the opportunity to confirm from their own experience the decisive significance of the people's regime and social system without capitalists and landlords for their own lives and the development of the entire national economy. Due to this increasing understanding, the ideological unity and organizational strength of the Polish trade union movement are strengthening today. The vast majority of trade union members are non-Party members. But this does not mean that they do not understand that without the correct leadership of the Party, which is armed with advanced socialist theory and serves as the vanguard, the victory and maintenance of the people's regime, and the construction of a higher and more rational social system, would be impossible. The great significance of the revolutionary trade union movement, as the broadest mass organization of the working class, lies in the fact that it enables the masses to more clearly understand the tasks of political struggle and the close connection between these tasks and the struggle of the working class for daily needs and material interests. This Congress will further tighten the connection between the existing workers' policies and their economic interests, and the connection between the task of strengthening the people's regime and the people's state and the daily living conditions of the broad laboring masses.

　　The social possession of the means of production in all basic sectors of the national economy (medium and large industries, transportation, communications, shipping, public utilities, wholesale and retail trade, etc.), and the planned economic system that turns over the surplus value created by socialized factories to state planning agencies for disposal, enable us to consciously guide the national production process without being dominated by the blind laws of supply and demand in the capitalist system. In addition to the social possession of the means of production and planned economy, the rate of growth of new investments in the national economy is the third factor. Because the people's state is able to distribute the surplus value created by socialized factories, it is able to use an increasing portion of the surplus value for new investments and construction, that is, to increase or modernize the means of production, and to build factories, production machines, and transportation tools. Only in this way can we guarantee the universal increase of production and the industrialization of the country, and make up for the technological and economic backwardness left by capitalism. The fourth factor is the increase in labor efficiency. The universal increase in the prosperity of the lives of the people depends on this. The productivity of individual workers and groups, and the national labor efficiency, must be improved. This depends on the improvement of tools, higher technology, better work organization, rationalization, and work ability; therefore, it depends on objective factors as well as subjective efforts and the ability of workers. Planned investment activities will take care of objective conditions, but it depends on the efforts and abilities of the workers themselves, which can only be solved by learning to work more efficiently. Some people say: let others work well, why should I work so extra hard? These are backward people without social conscience; they hinder and curb the improvement of labor efficiency, and curb the overall speed of national economic development; in this regard, they unintentionally violate their own interests. They often stubbornly adhere to their working attitudes that violate social interests, because no one fully cares about their work, and few people evaluate and supervise their work. This is why the fifth factor, that is, the supervision of the work of individual members by the production team, is no less than the other four factors. From what I have said, it is already clear that increasing production, which has become the wealth of the working people and is planned by state agencies, is the basis for improving the material welfare and culture of the laboring masses under the new conditions of the people's regime.

　　How is the increase in production compared to before the war? In 1946, my country's industrial production only reached three-quarters of the 1938 level. In 1947, we exceeded the pre-war level by 10 percent, while last year it exceeded 44 percent. The Six-Year Plan stipulates that production in 1955 will exceed three and a half times the pre-war level. Agricultural production, which is mainly based on the small commodity production of individual farmers, has developed differently. Last year, my country's agricultural production was about three-quarters of the pre-war level. But thanks to the country's help and efforts, we can also predict a gradual increase in production in this regard, which will increase by 40 percent in six years. The increase in production of course means a total increase in national income. It is estimated that by the end of the Sixth Five-Year Plan, this income will increase to three times the pre-war level. After the national income increases, it is possible to make larger investments to further develop our industry and modernize our socialized national economy. This year's investments in the plan will be more than twice that of 1938, and by the last year of the Sixth Five-Year Plan, it will be four and a half times that of 1938. In the next six years, our economic investment may be twice the investment of the bourgeois government during the entire period from 1918 to 1939. The significance of this comparison is beyond doubt. It means that the socialized economic structure is a higher and better organizational form than the previous capitalist economic structure. The basic task of trade unions is not only to explain this superiority to the working masses, but also to point out their new creative and responsible role in establishing this new social condition, and to help them put this condition into concrete organizational forms.

　　When we say that the working class should realize that it is the true master of the country's industry, transportation, and communications, etc., it means that the trade union, as an organization of a workers' group in a certain department, has several important and responsible tasks. Therefore, every organized group should become the true master of its own production department, effectively fulfill production tasks, be responsible for the quality of production, be responsible for the loyalty and efficiency of each member of the group, and be responsible for a fair evaluation of each member's efforts based on the results of their work. The group should point out the best as a model to educate all its members. In this regard, we must emphasize the great educational role of labor competitions, the organization of which may be discussed in more detail during the deliberations of the upcoming congress. For all members of the trade union, labor competition should become a practical school for labor organization. The results of labor competitions show the huge reserve strength and possibilities for increasing our production and our speed of progress. Learning the methods of labor winners, production rationalizers, and industrial experts--these are the tasks facing our entire working class. As for trade unions, we say that they should become schools for managing the country and the government, and schools for building a new social system. How do trade unions perform these important tasks? They should fulfill their daily activities through cooperation, solve the tasks they face due to production, solve social life and needs, and solve the pain and worries of trade union members. Caring about people, caring about their working conditions, their social education, the development of their awareness and knowledge, caring about their financial and family difficulties--this is the attitude that trade union organizations and their leading bodies should show to their members. Under such circumstances, the political and social activism of non-Party trade union masses will increase, and their confidence in trade union organizations and their leading bodies will increase. A considerable part of active trade union activists hold government or political positions. Strengthening the activism of trade union grassroots organizations and building their activism on the principles of internal democracy, and on the tested methods of criticism and self-criticism, will make it possible for active trade union activists to build their administrative or political work on mass experience, and on the daily difficulties and care of trade union members.

　　I believe that the issues of establishing the activism of the broad non-Party masses, raising their awareness, and instilling in them a sense of common responsibility for our country's economic, political, and cultural development will receive your due consideration. Not only the party of the working class that I represent, but also millions of non-Party workers, staff members, and progressive Polish intellectuals will closely watch your deliberation process.

　　I hope that the Congress will have fruitful results in further consolidating the trade union, in enhancing their role in our country's life and development, and in accelerating the work of moving towards a better future. (According to a dispatch from the Polish News Agency on the 1st)

　　波总统贝鲁特在波兰职工会代表大会上的演说（续完）
    在过去四年中，组织在职工会以内的劳动群众已有机会从他们自己的经验中确信：没有资本家与地主的人民政权与社会制度，对于他们自己的生活与整个国民经济的发展所具有的决定性的意义。由于这一愈益增加的认识，今天波兰职工会运动的思想统一和组织力量正在加强中。职工会会员极大部分是非党人士。但这并不是意味着他们不了解到：如果没有以先进的社会主义的理论所武装的、作为先锋队的党的正确领导，人民政权的胜利与维持，和更高的更合理的社会制度的建设，会是不可能达到的。作为最广泛的工人阶级群众组织的革命的职工会运动的巨大意义，正是在于它使群众更清楚地了解政治斗争的任务，和这种任务与工人阶级争取日常需要与物质利益这一斗争的紧密联系。本届大会将使现存于工人政策与他们的经济利益之间的联系，将使加强人民政权和人民国家这一任务与关切广大劳动群众日常生活条件之间的联系更加紧密。
    国民经济一切基本部门（中等和大的工业、运输、交通、航运、公用事业、批发和零售贸易等）中的生产手段的社会占有，以及把社会化工厂所创造的剩余价值交与国家计划机关处理的计划经济制度，使得我们能够自觉地指导全国的生产过程而不为资本主义制度中盲目的供求法则所支配。除了生产手段的社会占有和计划经济两个因素之外，国民经济新投资增长的速度，是第三个因素。因为人民国家能够分配社会化的工厂所创造的剩余价值，所以它能够将越来越大的一部分剩余价值用于新的投资和建设，就是说，增加生产手段或使之现代化，建设工厂、生产机器和运输的工具。只有这样才能保证生产的普遍增加和国家的工业化，才能弥补资本主义所遗下的技术与经济的落后。第四个因素就是劳动效率的增长。人民群众生活繁荣的普遍增加即取决于此。工人个人及小组的生产率和全国的劳动效率必须提高。这决定于工具的改进，更高的技术，更好的工作组织、合理化、工作能力；因此，它决定于客观的因素以及主观的努力和工人的能力。有计划的投资活动将照顾到客观的条件，但决定于工人本身努力与能力，这只能由他们学习更有效率地工作来解决。有些人说：让别人工作好啦，为什么我要那么额外努力呢。这些是没有社会良心的落后的人们；他们阻碍并遏止了劳动效率的提高，遏止了国民经济发展的总速度；在这方面他们无意地违反着他们自已利益。他们时常固执着他们违反社会利益的工作态度，因为没有人充分关心他们的工作，很少人去评价和监督他们的工作。这就是为什么第五个因素，即生产小组对会员个人工作的监督，一点也不下于其他四个因素。从我所说过的话，便已经明白了：增加那业已成为劳动人民的财富的，且由国家机关所计划的生产，是在人民政权的新条件下使劳动群众物质福利与文化提高的基础。
    与战前相较生产品增加的情形是怎样的呢？在一九四六年，我国工业的生产仅达到一九三八年水平的四分之三，一九四七我们超过了战前水平的百分之十，而去年则超过了百分之四十四。六年计划规定一九五五年的生产要超过战前三倍半。主要是以个体农民小商品生产为基础的农业生产，其发展情形却不同。去年我国农业生产约达战前水平的四分之三。但由于国家的帮助与努力，在这方面我们也可预卜生产的逐渐增加，在六年当中将增加百分之四十。生产的增加当然意味着国民收入的总增加。据估计在六年计划结束时，这笔收入将增加到战前水平的三倍。国民收入增加后，有可能以更大的投资来进一步发展我们的工业和我们社会化的国民经济，并使之现代化计划中的今年的投资将为一九三八年的两倍余，及至六年计划最后一年，则将为一九三八年的四倍半。在今后六年内，我们在经济方面的投资将可能为资产阶级政府整个时期——一九一八年到一九三九年——的投资的两倍。这个比较的意义是不容置疑的。它意味着社会化的经济结构，比以前资本主义的经济结构，是更高的和更好的组织形式。职工会的基本任务，不仅是把这种优越性向工人群众解释，而且要指出在建立这种新的社会条件中他们新的创造性的和负责任的作用，并且还要帮助他们把这种条件放到具体的组织形式中。
    当我们说工人阶级应该意识到它自己是国家工业、运输、交通事业等等的真正主人的时候，这就意味着，职工会作为某一部门的工人小组之组织，具有若干重要的与负责任的任务。因此，每一个有组织的小组应当变成他们自己生产部门的真正主人，有效的履行生产任务，要对生产成品的质量负责，要对小组的每一个成员的忠诚与效率负责，亦负责根据工作结果对每一成员的努力作一个公正的评价。小组应该指出最优秀的作为模范，来教育其一切组员。在这方面，我们必须着重指出劳动竞赛的巨大的教育作用，这种劳动竞赛的组织可能在将来大会的辩论中予以更详细的讨论。劳动竞赛对职工会一切会员说来，应当成为劳动组织的一个实际学校。劳动竞赛的结果，表明了增加我们生产和我们前进速度的巨大后备力量和可能性。学习劳动优胜者、生产合理化工作者、及精通工业者的方法，——这些就是摆在我们整个工人阶级面前的任务。至于职工会，我们说它们应该成为管理国家与政府的学校，建设新社会制度的学校。职工会如何执行这些重要的任务呢？它们应该以合作来履行它们日常的活动，解决它们因生产而面临的任务，解决社会生活和需要，与职工会会员们的苦痛和忧虑。关心人们，关心他的工作条件、他的社会教育、他的觉悟与知识的发展，关心他的财政与家庭的困难，——这就是职工会组织和它的领导机构对它的会员应该表示的态度。在这样情形下，非党职工会群众的政治与社会积极性将告增大，他们对职工会组织及其领导机构的信心将告增长。相当大的一部分积极的职工会运动者担负着政府或政治的职务。加强职工会下层组织的积极性，并将其积极性建基于内部民主原则上，建基于久经考验的批评与自我批评的方法上，则将使得积极的职工会运动者有可能将他们的行政或政治工作建基于群众经验、建基于对职工会会员日常的困难和照顾之上。
    我相信树立广大的非党群众的积极性，提高他们的觉悟，并向他们灌输对我国经济、政治和文化发展的共同责任感等问题，将受到你们的适当的考虑。不仅我所代表的工人阶级的党而且数百万的非党工人职员和进步的波兰知识分子都将密切地注视着你们考虑的过程。
    我希望大会在进一步巩固职工会，在提高它们在我们国的生活与发展中的作用，在加速向更好的将来迈进的工作上，将有丰硕的收获。（据波兰通讯社一日电）
