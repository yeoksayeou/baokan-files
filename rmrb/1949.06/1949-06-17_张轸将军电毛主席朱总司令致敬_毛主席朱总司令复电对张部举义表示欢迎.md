Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 16th: General Zhang Zhen, former Deputy Commander of the Central China Military and Political Headquarters of the Kuomintang, concurrently Chairman of Henan Province and Commander of the 19th Army Corps, sent a telegram to Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu De after the uprising, the text of which is as follows:

Chairman Mao, Commander-in-Chief Zhu:

Today, we resolutely break away from the reactionary camp and embrace the people, to pay the most lofty and unparalleled respect to the people's leader. Our hearts are extremely excited and gratified.

For the freedom of the nation, we and the people used our blood to participate in the eight-year anti-Japanese and anti-imperialist struggle. Unexpectedly, after the victory, bandit chieftain Chiang Kai-shek, in order to maintain his dictatorial crown, acted as an adopted son of American imperialism and a bodyguard for the big landlords and bureaucrats, tearing up the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference and launching an anti-people civil war. We also became his accomplices.

In the past three years, due to the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang's implementation of extremely cruel ideological rule and secret agent policies, and the forced execution of the so-called "suppression of the rebellion" policy, we used counter-revolutionary politics in Henan to protect local tyrants and evil gentry, and oppress all the poor people. Today, we feel boundless pain and sorrow. Today, we regret it, we are awakened, and we are determined to break away from the counter-revolutionary camp. On May 15, when the White bandits retreated from Wuhan, we carried out interceptions in Heshengqiao, and later in Zhengjiadian and Ma'anshan. This is our action to resolutely embrace the people, and this is our action to enthusiastically respond to Chairman Mao's call.

Now we are concentrated in central Hubei awaiting orders, vowing to learn and progress under your leadership with utmost sincerity, and to become a people's army. We support all the propositions and policies of the Chinese Communist Party. I cannot express all my wishes in this letter.

Sincerely,

Zhang Zhen, former Deputy Commander of the Central China Military and Political Headquarters of the Kuomintang and Commander of the 19th Army Corps, leading all officers and soldiers.

May 23rd.

Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 16th: Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu De replied to General Zhang Zhen by telegram today. The telegram stated:

General Zhang Zhen and all officers and soldiers of the former Kuomintang Army 19th Army Corps:

We have read your telegram of May 23. We welcome the uprising of your troops on the Central China front. We hope that the officers and soldiers of your unit will unite as one, work hard to learn the military and political system of the People's Liberation Army, improve the relationship between officers and soldiers and the relationship between the army and the people, and participate in the ranks of the Chinese people's liberation struggle. The remaining forces of the Kuomintang army are now very small in number, and if they try to resist, they will be quickly eliminated. We call on the generals in the remaining forces of the Kuomintang army who have a patriotic heart, like General Zhang, who are willing to lead their troops to break away from the counter-revolutionary camp and join the People's Liberation Army, we welcome them all. Their past guilt will be forgiven because of their actions that are beneficial to the people's cause.

Mao Zedong

Zhu De

　　张轸将军电毛主席朱总司令致敬
    毛主席朱总司令复电对张部举义表示欢迎
    【新华社北平十六日电】前国民党华中军政长官公署副长官兼河南省主席兼十九兵团司令官张轸于起义后即致电毛主席、朱总司令致敬，电文如下：毛主席、朱总司令：
    今天我们坚决的脱离反动阵营，投向人民怀抱，来向人民领袖致崇高无上的敬意，我们的心是十二万分的兴奋和快慰。
    为了民族自由，我们曾和人民用自己的血参加过八年的抗日的反帝斗争。不料胜利后匪首蒋介石为了保持独裁的皇冠，为美帝国主义作养子，为大地主大官僚作保镖，竟撕毁政协决议掀起了反人民的内战，我们也随他做了帮凶。
    三年来，由于蒋介石匪帮实施极端残酷思想统治和特务政策，和强迫执行所谓戡乱政策，我们在河南用反革命的政治来保护土豪劣绅，压迫所有的贫苦民众，今天，我们是无限的痛苦，无限的悲伤。今天我们后悔了，我们觉悟了，我们毅然决然要脱离反革命阵营，并于五月十五日当白匪撤退武汉时，我们在贺胜桥，以后又在郑家店、马鞍山各处施行截击。这是我们要坚决投向人民怀抱的行动，这是我们热烈响应毛主席号召的行动。
    现在我们集中鄂中待命，誓以至诚在你们领导之下学习、进步，作一支人民的队伍。拥护中国共产党一切主张和政策，临书不罄欲言。　前国民党华中军政副长官兼十九兵团司令张轸率全体官兵谨上　五月二十三日
    【新华社北平十六日电】毛主席、朱总司令本日电复张轸将军。电称：张轸将军及前国民党军十九兵团全体官兵们：
    五月二十三日通电读悉。我们对于贵部在华中前线的举义，表示欢迎。希望贵部官兵团结一致，努力学习人民解放军的军事政治制度，改进官兵关系和军民关系，参加中国人民解放斗争的行列。国民党军的残余力量现已为数甚少，欲图抵抗，势将迅速被消灭。我们号召国民党军残余力量中凡属有爱国心的将领如贵将军一流人物，愿意率部脱离反革命营垒，加入人民解放军方面者，我们均表欢迎。他们过去的罪责，将因他们的有益于人民事业的行为而获得宽恕。
    　　　　　　　　　　　　　　毛泽东
