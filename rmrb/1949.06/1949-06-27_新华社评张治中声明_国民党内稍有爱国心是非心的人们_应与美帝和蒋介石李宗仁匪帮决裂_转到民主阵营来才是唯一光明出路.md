Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, June 26th: Xinhua News Agency commentary: On Zhang Zhizhong's Statement: General Zhang Zhizhong, the former chief representative of the Nanjing Kuomintang government's peace negotiation delegation, issued a statement today expressing his views on the current situation in China. This statement can also be seen as the common opinion of the Nanjing Kuomintang government's peace negotiation delegation. We believe this statement is welcome; his advice to patriotic elements within the Kuomintang points out the only bright path for them.

The peace talks held in Beiping in April could have been a way out for the heads of the Nanjing Kuomintang group if they had any remorse at the time. However, the Kuomintang leadership, willingly directed by the American imperialist reactionaries and Kuomintang bandit leader Chiang Kai-shek, ultimately rejected peace, rendering the delegation they sent to Beiping's efforts futile. The Kuomintang reactionaries once fantasized that they could organize effective resistance along the Yangtze River line, and that the aid that American imperialism continues to provide could support their long-term struggle. Now that these fantasies have been shattered, the war criminals Chiang Kai-shek, Li Zongren, and others who are determined to be anti-revolutionary to the end are determined to be enemies of the country, the nation, and the people of the whole country, and continue to engage in frantic and desperate destruction with their remaining army, navy, air force, and special agent bandits. This destruction, of course, cannot hinder the complete victory of the Chinese revolution and save the complete failure of the reactionary elements, but the elements who willingly carry out the orders of destruction cannot escape the punishment of the people. At this time, where should those in the Kuomintang with a little patriotism and a little sense of right and wrong go? General Fu Zuoyi, General Lin Zun, General Zhang Zhen, and General Wu Qihui have already indicated their choice through action. Now, General Zhang Zhizhong has also indicated it through words. Their way out is to immediately break with American imperialism and the Chiang Kai-shek and Li Zongren bandit gangs, and join the people and the People's Liberation Army to quickly eliminate the reactionaries, end the war, stop the destruction, and enable the country and nation to begin comprehensive peaceful construction as soon as possible!

In his statement, General Zhang Zhizhong called for the rebirth of the Kuomintang. Of course, this does not refer to the entire Kuomintang. The entire Kuomintang has been abandoned by the people and history for its twenty-two years of reactionary crimes and the demise of its reactionary rule. However, there is a part of the Kuomintang who are willing to stand on the side of democracy, and this part has a bright future. Mr. Li Jishen, Ms. He Xiangning, Mr. Tan Pingshan, Mr. Chen Mingshu, and Mr. Cai Tingkai have long been engaged in democratic work, which goes without saying. Other patriotic Kuomintang members, as long as they have the determination and are truly willing to turn to the democratic camp, the democratic camp will inevitably adopt and has already adopted a welcoming attitude, giving them opportunities to serve the people and the country. For these people, as General Zhang Zhizhong said, they should be reborn, and they can be reborn.

### 新华社评张治中声明  国民党内稍有爱国心是非心的人们  应与美帝和蒋介石李宗仁匪帮决裂  转到民主阵营来才是唯一光明出路

　　新华社评张治中声明
    国民党内稍有爱国心是非心的人们应与美帝和蒋介石李宗仁匪帮决裂  转到民主阵营来才是唯一光明出路
    【新华社北平二十六日电】新华社社评：评张治中声明：前南京国民党政府和谈代表团首席代表张治中将军今天发表了一篇声明，表示他对于目前中国形势的看法。这个声明，也可以看作是南京国民党政府和谈代表团的共同意见。我们认为这个声明是值得欢迎的；共中对于国民党内爱国分子的劝告，是向他们指出了唯一的光明出路。
    四月间在北平举行的和平谈判，如果当时南京国民党集团的首脑们尚有悔祸之心，本是他们的一条出路。但是甘受美国帝国主义反动派和国民党匪首蒋介石指挥的国民党首脑机关，最后还是拒绝和平，使他们自己派赴北平的代表团前功尽弃。国民党反动派曾经幻想他们在长江一线还可以组织有效的抵抗，曾经幻想美国帝国主义至今还在继续供给的援助可以支持他们长期挣扎。现在这些幻想虽已经破灭，但是反革命到底的蒋介石、李宗仁等战犯，却决心与国家民族和全国人民为敌，指挥残余的陆空海军和特务匪徒继续从事疯狂的绝望的破坏。这种破坏当然不能阻碍中国革命的完全胜利和挽救反动分子的完全失败，但是甘心执行破坏命令的分子，却因而逃不脱人民的制裁。在这种时候，国民党内稍有爱国心、稍有是非心的人们应该向何处去呢？傅作义将军、林遵将军、张辎将军、吴奇伟将军等人已经用行动指示了他们。现在，张治中将军，又用言论指示了他们。他们的出路，就是立即与美国帝国主义和蒋介石李宗仁匪帮决裂，投入人民和人民解放军这一边来，迅速地消灭反动派，结束战争，停止破坏，使国家民族早日开始全面的和平建设！
    张治中将军在他的声明中要求国民党的新生。当然，这不是指的整个的国民党。整个的国民党已因二十二年的反动罪恶及其反动统治的灭亡而为人民所唾弃，为历史所唾弃。但是，国民党内有一部分人愿意站在民主方面，这一部分人自有其光明的前途。李济深先生、何香凝先生、谭平山先生、陈铭枢先生、蔡廷锴先生等人，他们早已从事民主的工作，固不待论。其他有爱国心的国民党人，只要他们具有决心，真正愿意转到民主阵营方面来，民主阵营必然会采取而且已经采取欢迎的态度，给他们以为人民国家服务的机会。对于这些人，正如张治中将军所说，应当新生，也可以新生。
