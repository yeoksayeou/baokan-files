Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, June 23rd: The Pravda in Moscow recently published an article by Viktorov entitled "On Anglo-American Contradictions" in response to readers' questions.

The author writes: American imperialism, which has grown rich through war, is stubbornly demanding world hegemony. At the same time, although Britain has in fact been greatly weakened after the war, it still controls the most important strategic positions, vast colonial markets and sources of raw materials, and is trying to maintain these positions. American monopoly capitalists, eager for indivisible hegemony, are of course unwilling to tolerate this situation. That is why a characteristic of the post-war period is the intensified American offensive against all political, strategic and economic positions of the British Kingdom.

Although the ruling groups of the United States and Britain are united in pursuing a policy of aggression and launching new wars, and are united in participating in the military alliances they have planned against the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries, and are united in following a policy of suppressing the people's liberation movements in colonial and dependent countries; however, this fact does not diminish the contradictions between the two countries in the slightest. Even during the Second World War, the United States, under the guise of "99-year leases," meddled with all British bases on the American Atlantic coast as a condition for aid to Britain. The United States took advantage of Britain's financial and economic difficulties to virtually drive Britain out of the Latin American market, while also infiltrating all markets of the British Kingdom without exception. American imperialism established its control in Canada, where its investments have exceeded five billion US dollars. American imperialism also keeps Australia under its influence and control. The United States is also increasingly stubbornly infiltrating India and other countries in Southeast Asia, trying to drive out its competitor, British imperialism. Needless to say, the main strategic locations in the Pacific are in the hands of the United States, not Britain.

American imperialism and British imperialism are engaged in the most intense struggle for oil resources in the countries of the Near East and Middle East. The struggle between American and British oil companies has led to a struggle between the two countries for political influence over these countries and for strategic strongholds leading to these countries.

The struggle to seize Near East oil has brought great importance to the Mediterranean issue. For decades, British imperialism has regarded the Mediterranean as the main road to the oil-rich resources of the Near East, the sea route to India, and the most important strategic channel of the British Kingdom, its "backbone," and has fought to try to control it alone. However, it has now lost this control. American imperialism has its bases in Italy and its pre-war colonies, and has already seized the former British bases in Greece.

The United States is also trying to drive British forces out of the European continent. In order to achieve this goal, it openly uses the infamous Marshall Plan, presenting it to the British people as the "generous assistance of an American benefactor." Through this plan, it guarantees the market for American goods in Europe, while blocking the sale of British goods. Moreover, on the basis of the Marshall Plan, American imperialism has effectively banned Britain from developing trade with the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries. Now, with the impending crisis, a further intensification of the struggle between the United States and Britain for markets is inevitable.

"Cooperation" between imperialist countries cannot prevent contradictions and struggles between them in the slightest. It is enough to cite the fact that the United States is cooperating with Britain on the German issue while also seizing control of the Ruhr. It is very typical that American imperialism widely uses the military alliance it jointly participates in with Britain to make Britain even more subordinate to the United States. For example, the United States uses the method of implementing arms standardization and promoting a frantic arms race among the signatory countries of the North Atlantic Treaty to increase Britain's economic difficulties (which are already serious enough), and to strengthen its pressure on Britain. The struggle between the United States and Britain holds endless hope for the United States. It is not without reason that some people compare the cooperation between the United States and Britain to the cooperation between a rider and a horse.

British imperialism agrees to this cooperation because the ruling groups of Britain and the United States share a common hatred of progressive democratic forces. British imperialism cannot but rely on American monopoly capitalists as the pillar of reactionaries all over the world. However, as revealed in the numerous talks of the vicious warmonger Churchill, British imperialism is mainly counting on provoking a conflict between the Soviet Union and the United States in order to restore the power and influence of the British Kingdom to at least some extent from the results of the mutual destruction of the Soviet Union and the United States. This plan is not new. British imperialism has made the same plan in the past, the only difference is that at that time they were calculating a conflict between Germany and the Soviet Union. However, British imperialism miscalculated greatly that time. This time, it will still fail.

### 维克托洛夫  论英美矛盾

    维克托洛夫
    论英美矛盾
    【新华社北平二十三日电】塔斯社莫斯科讯：真理报顷发表维克托洛夫所作“论英美矛盾”一文答读者问。
    作者写道：业已经由战争而致巨富的美国帝国主义，正在固执地要求世界霸权。同时，尽管英国事实上在战后已经是大大地削弱了，但是，它依然掌握着最重要的战略阵地，广大的殖民地市场和原料来源，并且力图保住这些阵地。美国垄断资本家，渴望着不容分割的霸权，当然不愿容忍此种情况。这就是为什么战后的一个特征是美国对于不列颠王国的政治、战略和经济的一切阵地的加紧进攻的原因。
    尽管美国和英国的统治集团一致奉行侵略与发动新战争的政策，一致参加他们所策划的敌视苏联和人民民主国家的军事联盟，一致遵循镇压殖民地国家与附属国家的人民解放运动的政策；可是，这种事实，丝毫不能缩小它们两国之间的矛盾。甚至在第二次世界大战中间，美国就已经在“九十九年租借”的掩护下，染指了英国在美洲大西洋岸的一切基地，作为对英援助的交换条件。美国利用英国财政的与经济的困难，实际上，已经把英国逐出拉丁美洲的市场，同时，还毫无例外地渗入了不列颠王国所有的一切市场。美国帝国主义建立了它在加拿大的控制，它在那里的投资已超过五十亿美元。美国帝国主义也将澳洲保持在它的影响和控制之下。美国还日益顽强地渗入印度和东南亚的其他国家，要把它的竞争者英帝国主义驱逐出去。不待说，太平洋上主要的战备地点，也是在美国手中而不在英国手中。
    美国帝国主义和英国帝国主义在近东和中东的国家里，正在进行最剧烈的夺取油源的斗争。美国与英国煤油公司之间的斗争，使得两国发生了争夺对这些国家的政治影响和通向这些国家的战略据点的斗争。
    夺取近东煤油的斗争，给地中海问题带来了极大的重要性。几十年来，英国帝国主义把地中海看为通向近东煤油富源的大路，通向印度的海道，看为不列颠王国最重要的战略通道，它的“脊椎骨”，而且进行了企图加以单独控制的斗争。可是，现在它已经丧失了这种控制。美国帝国主义在意大利及其战前殖民地中，都有了它的基地，而且已经夺取了英国从前在希腊的基地。
    美国还在努力把英国势力逐出欧洲大陆，为了达到这个目的，它公然利用臭名远扬的马歇尔计划，向英国人民表述为“美国恩主的慷慨援助”，它借助于这个计划，保证了美国货物在欧洲的市场，而堵塞英国货物的销路。不仅如此，在马歇尔计划的基础上，美国帝国主义实际上已经禁止英国发展对苏联和人民民主国家的贸易。现在，在危机即将来临之前，美英之间夺取市场斗争的更为加剧，是不可避免的。
    帝国主义国家的“合作”，丝毫不能阻止它们之间的矛盾和斗争。只消举出美国在德国问题上与英国合作同时又攫取鲁尔的控制权这一点就够明白了。很典型的一件事情，是美帝国主义广泛地利用他和英国共同参加的军事联盟，以使英国更加从属于美国。例如，美国利用实行军备标准化和促使北大西洋公约签字国家进行疯狂军备竞赛的办法，来增加英国的经济困难（虽然现在已经够严重的了），而且加强它对英国的压力。美英之间的斗争，对于美国有着无穷的希望。有人把美国和英国的合作比作骑马人和马的合作，不是没有道理的。
    英帝国主义同意这种合作，这是因为英美两国的统治集团对进步民主力量的仇视是共同一致的。英帝国主义不能不依靠美国的垄断资本家，作为全世界反动派的支柱。但是，正如凶恶的战争贩子邱吉尔的多次谈话所透露的，英帝国主义主要地是把它的算盘打在挑起苏美之间的冲突上，以便从苏美两败俱伤的结果中，至少在某种程度内恢复不列颠王国的威力和影响。这种打算并不新奇。英帝国主义过去曾经作过同样的打算，唯一不同的是，当时他们心里盘算的是德苏之间的冲突。但是，英帝国主义那一次是大大地错算了。这一次，它还是要落空的。
