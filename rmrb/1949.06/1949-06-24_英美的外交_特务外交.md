Anglo-American Diplomacy – Espionage Diplomacy
Fu Ying

What is the purpose of diplomacy? The task of diplomats should be to protect the national interests of their countries by peaceful means and to promote friendly relations between their countries and foreign countries.

However, those familiar with Anglo-American diplomacy know that Anglo-American diplomats protect not the national interests of Britain or the United States, but the interests of their monopolistic capitalists who are vying for world hegemony; they do not serve the people of Britain or the United States, but reactionary groups. Their activities are not aimed at promoting friendly relations between countries, but at provoking conflicts and causing international disputes.

The "Economist" weekly, the mouthpiece of the representative capitalists in London, published an article in early March, talking about the exposure of British and American agents in Eastern European countries, admitting that "some British and American diplomats are very fond of doing espionage." It is not ashamed of this kind of activity by Anglo-American diplomats, thinking it is a matter of course, only feeling a little unhappy because these diplomatic spies and saboteurs have been exposed and become notorious.

Anglo-American espionage diplomacy is particularly evident in the new democratic countries of Eastern Europe. These new democratic countries have broken away from the oppression of imperialism and from the capitalist system; Anglo-American imperialism is determined to use all means to regain its lost political, economic, and strategic positions in Eastern Europe. The mission of the Anglo-American diplomatic representatives sent to these new democratic countries is not to establish normal exchanges and friendly relations with these countries, but to overthrow the people's democratic governments of these countries. Their activities can be summarized as follows:

First, to organize anti-government conspiracies and rebellions, and for this purpose to assist reactionaries (including fascists) and the leaders of bourgeois political parties who have left the political stage, especially right-wing socialists.

Second, to engage in espionage and intelligence activities, using the above-mentioned reactionaries (including former Hitler's agents) as their tools.

Third, to carry out sabotage and terrorist acts to hinder the economic development of the new democratic countries, undermine their defense forces, instigate domestic dissatisfaction, and prevent them from implementing democratic reforms.

Fourth, to attempt to spread war psychology, emphasizing the inevitability of war, making people fearful, uneasy, and tense.

Let us take the Mindszenty case, which was cracked in Hungary in February this year, as an example. This bishop, as the representative of the Vatican, engaged in espionage and sabotage activities, attempting to overthrow the republican government and restore the Habsburg dynasty. The American Minister to Hungary, Chapin, helped him with money, used him as a spy, and directed his activities. This bishop collected secret intelligence through priests, providing information on Soviet forces in Hungary, communist activities, and various political and economic situations to American Minister Chapin and Secretary Koczak. The bishop confessed during the trial: "My relationship with the Western powers, with their representatives in Hungary, depended on my desire to use the assistance of these countries—primarily the United States—to withdraw the Soviet occupying forces from Hungary, and then to change the government with the help of the Americans. I maintained frequent contact with the Western powers' diplomatic missions in Hungary—primarily the American mission—in order to achieve this goal." It can be seen that the purpose of the activities of American diplomats in Hungary was to attempt to overthrow the People's Democratic Government of Hungary, which the American imperialists did not like, by force.

The activities of Anglo-American diplomatic representatives in Romania were roughly similar. In October and November 1948, a group of conspirators serving the Anglo-American intelligence services were tried for conspiring to overthrow the people's democratic government by force and restore the bourgeois and landlord regime. The operating expenses of this group were provided by Ausnit. He was a Romanian exiled capitalist, a partner in the British arms monopoly company Vickers, a shareholder in the largest British bank, Westminster Bank, and a shareholder in many large American companies. The plan of this group of conspirators was formulated in coordination with Anglo-American diplomats, who promised them economic and military assistance, while they collected secret intelligence for the Anglo-American diplomats. The leader of the saboteurs, Pop, confessed in court: "At the request of the British and Americans, political and economic intelligence was systematically supplied to them. … During a meal, Mr. Melbourne, Counselor of the American Embassy, suggested a plan, and we acted according to that plan. … They promised, through Melbourne Tanleviris (Counselor of the American Embassy), to provide us with weapons, equipment, food, and transportation. At the appropriate time, these things will be dropped by parachute at designated locations. Anglo-American instructors will also parachute down to direct the activities of the sabotage team. When the Americans give the signal, the conspiracy group will act immediately."

In Bulgaria, Anglo-American imperialists also used missionaries to engage in espionage and sabotage activities, directing them to conspire to overthrow the Fatherland Front government in order to restore the fascist government. In May 1947, the British mission gave Jakov (one of the saboteurs) the following instructions: "There are dissatisfied elements opposing the government, some of whom belong to your church. These dissatisfied groups are the best ground for our work and your work. The more dissatisfied elements there are in Bulgaria, the harder it will be for the communists to control the Fatherland Front. You must work among the dissatisfied groups and unite them into larger groups. I want you to work among the dissatisfied elements and establish friendly relations with them."

In Poland, British Ambassador Cavendish-Bentinck and American Ambassador Lane, together with their military attachés, directed the sabotage and terrorist activities of Polish underground organizations.

From the ironclad facts stated above, Anglo-American diplomacy is indeed espionage diplomacy. Anglo-American politicians do not hide this point. In March 1948, U.S. Senator Bridges proposed his infamous plan in the Senate, advocating the organization of sabotage, terrorist activities, and espionage activities in the new democratic countries. The American bourgeois organ, "U.S. News & World Report," soon followed with an article entitled "Secret Strategies of the Cold War," frankly advocating: "Violent methods, including the use of assassination if necessary," "financially support underground movements in pro-Soviet countries," organize violent teams "under American guidance," "encourage the assassination of key communist figures," and "American agents parachute into various parts of Eastern Europe to coordinate anti-communist actions." It is said that the U.S. government and Congress once studied a plan to allocate a sum of money to the State Department specifically for funding anti-communist underground activities in the new democratic countries of Eastern Europe.

Last summer, the head of the British Military Intelligence Agency, Sillitoe, went to the United States to discuss how to coordinate British and American intelligence and sabotage activities in Eastern European countries. His proposed plan included: hindering the cooperation between the new democratic countries and the Soviet Union, using various methods to incite distrust of the Soviet Union, fully utilizing the opposition to sabotage industrial and government work, fabricating anti-Soviet propaganda materials and transporting them into Eastern Europe, and undermining the defense capabilities of Eastern European countries.

Of course, the espionage diplomacy of Anglo-American imperialism is nothing new. American diplomats have long been engaging in espionage activities in Latin American countries. The countless "revolutions" in Latin American countries are mostly the "masterpieces" of American diplomats!

Anglo-American diplomatic activities in the Soviet Union have also been engaging in espionage activities since the success of the October Revolution. Ms. Buga's book "The Truth About American Diplomats" reveals the true face of American diplomats as spies. However, the Soviet Union is very experienced in discovering the activities of imperialist diplomatic agents, making it difficult for them to operate.

Due to the victory of the Chinese People's Liberation War, the imperialists' espionage activities in China will inevitably be strengthened. The recent Xinhua News Agency's report on the espionage activities of the former U.S. Consulate General in Shenyang after the liberation of Shenyang makes us more deeply appreciate the correctness of the instructions of Comrade Mao Zedong, the wise leader of the Chinese people, at the Preparatory Meeting of the New Political Consultative Conference. He told us: "Here, I think it is necessary to call people's attention to this, that is: the imperialists and their running dogs, the Chinese reactionaries, will not be reconciled to their failure on the land of China. They will still collude with each other and use all possible means to oppose the Chinese people. For example, sending their running dogs to infiltrate China to carry out divisive work and sabotage work. This is inevitable, they will never forget this task. … We must not relax our vigilance against the frantic retaliatory conspiracies of the imperialist elements and their running dogs because of victory. Whoever relaxes this vigilance will disarm himself politically and place himself in a passive position. In this case, the people of the whole country must unite and resolutely, thoroughly, and completely smash any conspiracy of the imperialists and their running dogs, the Chinese reactionaries, against the Chinese people."

Anglo-American imperialists overestimate their own strength and underestimate the strength of the people. They think that they can change the course of historical development by means of espionage and sabotage. American imperialism thinks that the methods they used in Latin America can be transplanted to the new democratic countries of Eastern Europe and the people's China. But the facts have proved that the high degree of vigilance of the broad masses of the new democratic countries of Eastern Europe and the people's China in protecting their freedom, sovereignty, and independence has shattered—and will continue to shatter—the espionage activities of Anglo-American diplomats. The failure of Anglo-American espionage diplomacy is inevitable.

    英美的外交——特务外交
    福英
    外交目的是什么？外交官的任务应该是：以和平手段保护其本国的民族利益，并促进本国与外国之间的友好关系。
    但是熟悉英美外交的，都知道英美外交官所保护的并不是英国或美国的民族利益，而是其争夺世界霸权的独占资本家的利益；不是为英国或美国的人民服务，而是为反动集团服务。他们的活动，目的并不在于促进各国间的友好关系，而是挑拨冲突和引起国际纠纷。
    伦敦的代表资本家的喉舌的“经济学家”周刊在三月初发表了一篇论文，讲到在东欧诸国的英美特务之被暴露，承认说“有些英美外交官很喜欢干特务的勾当。”它对于英美外交官的这种活动，毫不为耻，以为是当然的事，只因为这些外交的间谍和破坏分子被揭露，闹得个声名狼籍，才感到有些不痛快罢了。
    英美的特务外交，在东欧的新民主主义诸国中，表现得特别明显。这些新民主主义国家已摆脱了帝国主义的压迫，脱离了资本主义的体系；英美帝国主义决心不恤用一切手段来夺回其已丧失的在东欧的政治的、经济的、和战略的阵地。英美派往这些新民主主义国家的外交代表的使命，不是要与这些国家建立正常的往来与友好的关系，而是要推翻这些国家的人民民主政府。他们的活动可以概括为下列几种：
    第一、组织反政府的阴谋叛乱，为此目的而援助反动分子（包括法西斯分子）以及离开了政治舞台的资产阶级政党的头目，尤其是右派社会主义者。
    第二、从事间谍和情报活动，利用上述的反动分子（包括从前的希特勒的特务分子）为其工具。
    第三、进行破坏活动和恐怖行为，以阻碍新民主主义国家的经济发展，破坏其国防力量，鼓动其国内的不满，并阻止其实行民主的改革。
    第四、企图散布战争心理，强调战争之不能避免，使人民恐惧、不安、紧张。
    我们就以今年二月间匈牙利所破获的敏曾蒂案件来说吧。这位主教是梵蒂岗的代表，从事间谍活动和破坏活动，图谋推翻共和政府，以恢复哈布斯堡王朝。美国驻匈公使柴平以金钱帮助他，利用他为间谍，指挥他的活动。这位主教经由教士收集秘密情报，把关于苏联在匈兵力、共产党活动、以及各种政治经济情况的消息，供给美国公使柴平与书记柯查克。这位主教在审判时供招道：“我与西方列强的关系，与它们驻匈的代表们的关系，是取决于我欲借这些国家——首先是美国——的助力使苏联占领军从匈牙利撤退，然后借美国人的帮助来改变政府。我是为达到此一目的而与西方列强驻匈外交使团——首先与美国使团保持经常接触”。可见，美国驻匈外交官的活动目的是企图以暴力推翻美国帝国主义者所不喜欢的匈牙利人民民主政府。
    英美外交代表在罗马尼亚的活动，也大致与此相似。在一九四八年十月与十一月间，审判一群为英美情报部服务的阴谋者，他们阴谋以武力推翻人民民主政府，恢复资产阶级和地主的政权。这一群人的活动经费是欧士尼特供给的。他是一位罗马尼亚流亡的资本家，是英国军火独占公司——维克尔公司的合伙股东，英国最大银行威斯敏士忒银行的股东，同时又是美国许多大公司的股东。这一伙阴谋者的计划是与英美外交人员协同规定的，由英美外交人员答应给他们经济的和军火的援助，他们则为英美外交人员搜集秘密情报。破坏分子的头目波普在法庭上供招道：“由于英人和美人的要求，有系统地将政治经济情报供给他们。……在吃餐时，美国使馆参事梅尔柏恩建议一个计划，我们就照该计划活动。……他们经由梅尔柏恩坦勒维里斯（美国使馆参事）答应供给我们武器、装备、食品、及运输工具。在适当时机，将用降落伞将这些东西投掷于指定地点。英美指导人员也将用降落伞跳下来指挥破坏队的活动。美国人发出信号，阴谋集团就将立刻动作起来。”
    在保加利亚也发生英美帝国主义者利用传道会的教士从事间谍活动和破坏活动，指挥他们阴谋推翻祖国阵线的政府，以恢复法西斯政府，在一九四七年五月间，英国使团曾给嘉可夫（破坏分子之一）以如下的指示：“有不满分子反对政府，其中有一些是属于你的教会。这些不满意的集团是我们的工作与你们的工作的最好的园地。在保加利亚的不满分子越多，共产党就越难控制祖国阵线。你必须在不满意的集团中间工作，把他们团结成为更大的集团。我要你在不满分子中间工作，并与他们建立友好的关系。”
    在波兰，英国大使卡文提斯奔霆、美国大使兰恩，协同着他们的军事参赞，指挥波兰的地下组织的破坏活动与恐怖行为。
    从上面所说的铁一般的事实看来，英美的外交确实是特务外交。英美的政客也并不掩蔽此点。在一九四八年三月，美国参议员勃里治曾在参院提出其恶名昭彰的计划，主张在新民主主义国家中组织破坏活动、恐怖行为，和间谍活动。美国资产阶级机关报——“美国新闻与世界报导”不久也跟着发表一篇论文，题为“冷战的秘密策略”，坦白地主张：“暴力的方法，如必要则可包括使用暗杀手段”，“以金钱资助亲苏国家中的地下运动”，组织暴力队“由美国指导”，“鼓励暗杀主要共产党人物”，“美国特务分子用降落伞跳于东欧各地，以配合反共行动”。据说，美国政府和议会曾经研究一个计划，拨一笔款给国务院，专供资助东欧新民主主义诸国中的反共地下活动之用。
    去年夏季，英国军事情报局长西里托到美国去，与美国商讨如何配合英美在东欧诸国的情报和破坏活动。他所提出的计划包括：阻碍新民主主义国家与苏联的合作，用各种方法鼓动对苏联的不信任，充分利用反对派来破坏工业和政府工作，捏造反苏宣传材料并将其运进东欧；破坏东欧诸国的国防能力。
    当然，英美帝国主义的特务外交并不是什么新的东西。美国外交家在拉丁美洲各国早就在干着特务的勾当。拉丁美洲各国的无数次的“革命”，大都就是美国外交家的“杰作”！
    英美在苏联的外交活动，自十月革命成功以来，也就在干着特务的活动。布加女士所著“美国外交家的真相”一书，揭露了美国外交家的特务真面目。可是，苏联对于发现帝国主义者外交特务的活动已很有经验，使得他们很难活动。
    由于中国人民解放战争的胜利，帝国主义在华的特务活动必然也将加强。最近新华社所发表的关于美国驻沈前领事馆在沈阳解放后的特务活动，使我们更深切地体会中国人民的英明领袖毛泽东同志在新政协筹备会上的指示的正确，他告诉我们说：“在这里，我认为有必要唤起人们的注意，这即是：帝国主义者及其走狗中国反动派对于他们在中国这块土地上的失败，是不会甘心的。他们还会要互相勾结在一起，用各种可能的方法，反对中国人民。例如，派遣他们的走狗钻进中国内部来进行分化工作和捣乱工作。这是必然的，他们决不会忘记这一项工作。……我们决不可因为胜利，而放松对于帝国主义分子及其走狗们的疯狂的报复阴谋的警惕性。谁要是放松这一项警惕性，谁就将在政治上解除武装，而使自己处于被动的地位。在这种情况下，全国人民必须团结起来，坚决彻底干净全部地粉碎帝国主义者及其走狗中国反动派的任何一项反对中国人民的阴谋计划。”
    英美帝国主义者对于自己的力量估计过高，对于人民的力量估计过低。他们以为用特务的破坏手段就能够改变历史发展的路程。美国帝国主义以为他们在拉丁美洲所用的方法，能够移植于东欧新民主主义国家和人民的中国。但事实已证明东欧新民主主义国家和人民中国的广大群众为保护其自由、主权、和独立的高度警惕性，已粉碎了—也将继续粉碎—英美外交官的特务活动。英美的特务外交之失败是必然的。
