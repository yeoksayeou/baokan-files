The North China People's Government has invested 60 million jin of millet into this year's river management projects, including reinforcing embankments and repairing dangerous sections of major rivers, achieving significant results.

　　Ji-Lu-Yu

The Ji-Lu-Yu Yellow River embankment reinforcement and dam foundation soilwork project began in late March. The standard for reinforcing embankments is one meter above the 1937 flood level, requiring over 3 million cubic meters of earthwork, stretching over 23,000 meters. By largely changing the method of requisitioning labor to contracting, labor efficiency has been greatly improved. When requisitioning labor, each worker only did a little over one cubic meter of earthwork, but now, with contracting, each worker is doing two or even three cubic meters. The work of collecting 14.9 million jin of straw has also been completed. Planting willows along the embankment to protect it, with Puyang County alone planting over 26,000 trees. Currently, the work of repairing old and new dangerous sections of the Yellow River is proceeding intensively.

　　Taihang

The blocking of the Dafan breach in the Qin River in the Taihang area was also completed on May 2nd, freeing over 200,000 people from annual flooding, and 400,000 mu of farmland can once again see green shoots.

　　Ji-East

The breach at Wangjia Fabao on the Luan River in the Ji-East area occurred in 1945, and had been blocked three times before, all unsuccessfully. This year, after two months of effort by river management workers, it was successfully closed on May 21st. In addition to raising and strengthening the original dam and spur dikes, the project also included excavating a diversion channel about five kilometers long and a 150-meter-long dry-laid stone revetment, as well as a four-kilometer-long flood control embankment. The total earthwork for the project was approximately 175,500 cubic meters, and over 14,000 cubic meters of rubble. The North China People's Government subsidized one million jin of millet for materials and wages. Pedestrians on the Luanle Highway witnessed the tall dam and the shuttle of transport vehicles and boats, praising the project. They said happily, "We can rest assured this year!"

　　Ji-Central

The main rivers in the Ji-Central area, such as the Hutuo River, Yongding River, and Daqing River, established spring construction headquarters one after another in mid-April to specifically manage the construction work, and organized five surveying teams to conduct on-site surveys, which have now been completed. Due to the construction surveys, appropriate increases and decreases have been made to the projects. For example, according to statistics from five counties along the Nanyun River, the earthwork has been reduced by about 60% compared to the original estimate, while nine new repairs have been added. The Nanyun River, except for individual dangerous projects, has been largely completed. The Wangkou diversion canal on the Ziya River has been completed. Most of the other embankment reinforcements, channel clearing, and repairs of dangerous sections have been completed, with the remainder to be completed before the wheat harvest. After the Wen'anwa Santan drainage river was released in early April, it is expected to drain about 500 qing of land, and the dredging project is underway. Half of the first phase can be excavated in half a month, and the second phase is expected to be completed by the end of June when the water is at its lowest. The dangerous projects on the Hutuo River, the Raoyang and Anping embankment reinforcements, six-tenths of the Anping northern dam, and some of the small dams above Shenze will all be completed before the wheat harvest, while the remaining parts and the riverbed realignment downstream will be repaired after the wheat harvest. The Zhuolong River embankment reinforcement and repairs of dangerous sections, except for one small section, were all completed by the end of May. Construction on the Daqing River began in mid-May, and generally, it can also be completed before the wheat harvest. In addition, the renovation project of the new canal, which is over 180 li long, the Renqiu Gougezhuang ship lock, and the Hejian Banjiehe ship lock have been completed, and most of the Xianxian ship lock has also been completed. Because the Yongding River was liberated relatively late, preparations are now being actively made, and some construction has already begun. The small dike in front of the Li Village breach in Linqing, Ji'nan, has been rebuilt into a large dike, but the slope is insufficient, and the junction between the new and old dikes is closely adjacent to the ponds inside and outside the dike. It must be protected by a monthly dike. To ensure the safety of the people's lives and property, after re-surveying, it was decided to block the entrance and tamp it firmly. Work is now underway for the second time. A total of 33 repairs are being made on the Wei Canal, including 24 brick dams and 9 hydraulic structures, and construction is actively underway.

　　Ji-West

Ten flood control projects in Ji-West, such as the Shihou in Chengnanzhuang, Fuping (Yanzhi River), Chenzhuang in Lingshou (Ci River), and the Shahe levee in Xingtang, have all been under construction for some time. Digging the Heishui ditch in Xushui County can avoid flooding 16,900 mu of land. During the construction process, many water conservancy engineering technicians from Beijing and Tianjin also went to Ji'nan, Ji-Lu-Yu, Ji-Central Shibeihe, and Ji-East Luanhe to participate in the river management work. As the flood season is approaching, the flood prevention work to ensure the safety of the lives and property of millions of people is becoming increasingly urgent and serious. All localities should be fully prepared and thoroughly inspect the completed projects to avoid losses caused by being caught off guard when the floods arrive.

　　华北人民政府拨米六千万斤
  　整修全区主要河流
  　应周密检查已完工程预防大汛平津水利技术人员参加治河工程
    【本报讯】华北人民政府以六千万斤小米，投入今年各主要河流复堤整险的治河工程，现已获得很大成绩。
　　冀鲁豫
    冀鲁豫黄河复堤及修坝基土工程，自三月下旬即已开始，复堤以高出民国廿六年洪水位一公尺为标准，共须做土三百多万立方公尺，工段长达二万三千余公尺，由于大部分将征工的办法改为包工进行，大大的提高了劳动效率，征工时每工只做一方多土，现在包工竟达到每工做两方，甚至三方土。齐集一千四百九十万斤秸料的工作亦已全部完成。沿堤植柳护堤、濮县一地植树达二万六千余棵。现黄河的整旧险及修新险工作，正紧张进行中。
　　太行
    太行区沁河大樊堵口工作，也于五月二日完成，使二十余万人民摆脱了历年水灾，四十万亩耕地又可重见青苗。
　　冀东
    冀东区滦河王家法宝的决口，系一九四五年发生，前后堵过三次，均失败，今年经过治河员工两个月的努力，于五月廿一日已告合龙。该工程除加高增强原有之堵坝、丁坝外，并开挖长约五公里之引河和一百五十公尺长的干砌石护岸一道，四公里长的防洪土堤。工程全部土方约十七万五千五百余公方，一万四千余公方块石，材料工资华北人民政府补助小米百万斤。滦乐公路行人目见堵坝高大，运料车船穿梭往返，齐声赞扬，他们高兴的说：“今年可以放心了”。
　　冀中
    冀中滹沱河、永定河、大清河等主要河流，于四月中先后成立春工指挥部，专理施工工作，并组织五个测量队，进行实地勘查，现已测量完毕。由于经过施工测量，工程上都做了适当的增减，如南运河据五个县统计，土方比原估减少了约百分之六十，修险工程增加了九处；滹沱、潴龙两河则较原预算减缩小米三十九万四千四百六十二斤。现南运河除个别险工外，已大部完成。子牙河王口引河已完成，其他复堤、开卡、修险大部完工，余部麦收前完成。文安洼三滩排水河四月初放水后，约可脱出地五百顷，疏浚工程正进行中；第一期半个月可挖一半，第二期待六月底水最枯时完成。滹沱河各险工，饶阳、安平复堤，安平筑北埝十分之六，深泽以上小埝一部都在麦收前完成，其余部分及下游改道处修整河床，留待麦收后完成。潴龙河复堤修险除一小处外，都在五月底完工。大清河五月中旬动工，一般也能在麦收前完成。另外长达一百八十余华里之新运河改修工程，任邱苟各庄船闸，河间半截河船闸已告竣工，献县船闸亦完成大部。永定河因解放较晚，现正积极备料，并已部分施工。冀南临清李庄决口前之小堤复大堤，业已做好，惟坡度不够，且新堤与旧堤之接头处，堤之内外紧贴潭坑。须以月堤围护之，为保障人民生命财产万全计，经重新勘查，决将门口堵住，夯打坚实，现正再一次动工堵修。卫运河共修险工三十三处，计砖坝二十四处，水廉子九处正积极着手施工。
　　冀西
    冀西阜平城南庄石猴，（胭脂河）灵寿陈庄（慈河）行唐沙河大堤等十处防洪工程都早已施工，徐水县挑挖黑水沟可免一万六千九百亩地的水患。在施工过程中，不少平津的水利工程技术人员也分赴冀南冀鲁豫冀中石碑河，冀东滦河等地实际参加治河工作。现汛讯行将来到，保障千百万人民生命财产安全的防汛工作，已日益急迫严重，各地应充分准备，周密检查已完工程，免得洪水来到，措手不及而造成损失。
