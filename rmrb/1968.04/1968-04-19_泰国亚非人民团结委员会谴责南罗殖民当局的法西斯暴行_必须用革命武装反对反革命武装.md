The Thailand Afro-Asian People's Solidarity Committee recently issued a statement strongly condemning the fascist atrocities of the Southern Rhodesian colonial authorities led by Smith, who brutally murdered Zimbabwean freedom fighters.

The statement pointed out that this heinous crime by the Smith white colonial authorities was instigated and condoned by American and British imperialism.

The statement said that the Thai people firmly support the Zimbabwean people's armed revolutionary struggle to overthrow the new and old colonialist rule and Smith's white racist regime.

The statement said that the struggle against new and old colonialist rule and racial oppression can only achieve victory by using revolutionary armed forces to oppose counter-revolutionary armed forces; there is no other way.

The statement pointed out that the Thai people, like the Zimbabwean people and all oppressed and exploited people around the world, suffer from the oppression and exploitation of imperialism. Under the leadership of the Communist Party of Thailand, the Thai people, following the teachings of the great leader Chairman Mao Zedong, are waging a people's war to overthrow the Thanom-Praphat traitorous clique and drive American imperialism out of Thailand.

The statement finally emphasized: "We firmly believe that only by combining the contemporary peak of Marxism-Leninism—Mao Zedong Thought—with the revolutionary practice of the peoples of various countries, can the oppressed and exploited peoples of the world achieve true liberation."

    泰国亚非人民团结委员会谴责南罗殖民当局的法西斯暴行
    必须用革命武装反对反革命武装
    新华社讯　据“泰国人民之声”电台十日广播，泰国亚非人民团结委员会最近发表声明，最强烈地谴责南罗得西亚史密斯白人殖民当局野蛮杀害津巴布韦自由战士的法西斯暴行。
    声明指出，史密斯白人殖民当局的这一滔天罪行，得到了美、英帝国主义的唆使和纵容。
    声明说，泰国人民坚决支持津巴布韦人民为推翻新老殖民主义统治和史密斯白人种族主义统治而进行的革命武装斗争。
    声明说，反对新老殖民主义统治和种族主义压迫的民族解放斗争，只有用革命武装去反对反革命武装，才能取得胜利，舍此没有其他道路。
    声明指出，泰国人民也跟津巴布韦人民以及全世界被压迫被剥削人民一样，遭受帝国主义的压迫和剥削。泰国人民在泰国共产党领导下，按照伟大导师毛泽东主席的教导，用人民战争去推翻他侬—巴博卖国集团，把美帝国主义从泰国驱逐出去。
    声明最后强调说：“我们坚信，只有把当代马克思列宁主义的最高峰——毛泽东思想与各国人民的革命实践相结合，全世界被压迫被剥削的人民才能得到真正的解放。”
