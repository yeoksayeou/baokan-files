	This is the first nationwide telecommunications workers' strike in over twenty years, and it has quickly spread to forty-two states.

		Xinhua News Agency, April 19th: Washington – Following the unprecedented scale of violent resistance by African Americans, which has dealt a heavy blow to U.S. imperialism, over 200,000 telecommunications workers in forty-two states launched a nationwide strike on the 18th, dealing a new blow to the reactionary rule of the U.S. monopoly capitalists.

		This telecommunications workers' strike is the first nationwide strike in twenty-one years. The strike began in Alabama and quickly spread across the country to forty-two states. Due to the rising cost of living in the U.S., exacerbated by the escalating "upgrading" of the Vietnam War and the malignant expansion of military spending, the striking workers are demanding wage increases, higher overtime pay, and night shift pay.

		This is the fourth nationwide strike in the U.S. in less than a year. The continuous outbreak of workers' strikes in the U.S. indicates that U.S. imperialism's reactionary policies of external expansion and aggression, and internal exploitation, are increasingly provoking strong resistance from the American working people.

		Not long ago, over 60,000 copper workers in twenty-three states went on strike starting last July, lasting for nine months. This strike brought U.S. copper production to a near halt, costing the U.S. 40,000 tons of copper per week, and severely impacting the U.S. imperialists' war production in Vietnam.

		Almost simultaneously, the first post-war nationwide railroad workers' strike in the U.S. brought over 95% of rail transportation to a standstill, causing many important industrial sectors to halt production due to lack of materials, severely impacting the military transportation for the Vietnam War.

		Since the beginning of this year, even many public sector employees have broken through the Johnson administration's various "laws" prohibiting civil servants from striking, launching wave after wave of strikes.

		As class contradictions within the U.S. sharpen, not only are the oppressed African Americans rapidly awakening, but the white working people, who are also oppressed and exploited, are actively taking up the struggle. The U.S. ruling class is now in a desperate situation, facing blows from all sides and struggling to cope.

    给美国垄断资产阶级反动统治以新的冲击
    美国二十多万电讯工人大罢工
    这是二十多年来第一次席卷全国的电讯工人大罢工，罢工迅速扩展到四十二州
    新华社十九日讯　华盛顿消息：在美国黑人空前规模的抗暴斗争给予美帝国主义以沉重的打击之后，美国四十二个州的二十多万电讯工人十八日掀起了全国范围的罢工斗争，给予美国垄断资产阶级的反动统治以新的冲击。
    这次电讯工人大罢工是美国二十一年来第一次横扫全国的电讯工人大罢工。这次罢工斗争从亚拉巴马州开始，迅速扩展到全国四十二个州。由于美国的生活费用随着侵越战争的不断“升级”和军事开支的恶性膨胀正在急剧上涨，因此，罢工工人要求增加工资，增加加班费和夜班工资。
    这次电讯工人大罢工也是美国在不到一年的时间里发生的第四次全国范围的罢工斗争。美国工人罢工斗争不断爆发的情况，说明美帝国主义对外扩张侵略、对内加紧剥削的反动政策，正日益引起美国劳动人民的强烈反抗。
    不久前，二十三个州的六万多铜业工人大罢工从去年七月开始，一共坚持了九个月。这次罢工使美国铜的生产几乎全部停顿，使美国每星期损失四万吨铜，沉重地打击了美帝侵越战争的军火生产。
    与铜业工人大罢工几乎同时爆发的美国战后第一次铁路工人全国大罢工，曾迫使美国百分之九十五以上的铁路运输陷于停顿，使许多重要工业部门停工待料，严重地打击了侵越战争的军事运输。
    今年开年以来，连许多公教人员也冲破了约翰逊政府禁止公务人员罢工的种种“法律”的束缚，掀起了一次又一次的罢工浪潮。
    随着美国国内阶级矛盾的日益尖锐，不仅深受压迫的美国黑人正在迅速觉醒，同样遭受压迫和剥削的美国白人中的劳动人民，也在积极开展斗争，美国统治集团正处在到处挨打、穷于应付的狼狈处境中。
