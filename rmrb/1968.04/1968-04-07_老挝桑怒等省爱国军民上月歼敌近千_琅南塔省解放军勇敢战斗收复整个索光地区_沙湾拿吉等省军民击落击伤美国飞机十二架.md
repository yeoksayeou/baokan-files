Patriotic military and civilians of Xam Neua and other provinces in northern Laos launched extensive and continuous attacks on the enemy in March and conducted anti-bandit struggles, annihilating and disbanding nearly a thousand enemy troops.

In March, the patriotic military and civilians of Xam Neua Province fought twenty-four heroic battles. According to incomplete statistics, they annihilated and disbanded 600 enemy troops, shot down and destroyed 13 enemy aircraft, and seized 180 pieces of artillery and other weapons.

It is particularly worth mentioning that the patriotic military and civilians of Xam Neua Province completely destroyed the bandit stronghold in the Bati area from March 10 to 13, annihilating 250 bandits and forcing nearly 200 bandits to surrender.

During this period, the patriotic military and civilians of this province liberated 110 villages and nearly 10,000 residents.

The patriotic military and civilians of Luang Prabang Province, riding on the momentum of victory, annihilated and disbanded 141 enemy troops in March, seizing a large number of weapons, ammunition, and military supplies.

The patriotic military and civilians of Phongsaly, Luang Namtha, and Sayaboury Provinces continued to fight against "sweeping" operations and bandits in March, annihilating and disbanding 249 enemy troops, sinking nine motorboats and patrol boats, blowing up one bridge, and seizing 86 pieces of various weapons.

The patriotic military and civilians of Xam Neua Province also shot down one American aircraft in mid-March.

The patriotic military and civilians of Savannakhet Province, on March 4, bravely counterattacked invading American air pirates and shot down five American aircraft in one battle.

The patriotic military and civilians along the Ninth Highway in residential areas shot down one invading American pirate aircraft and damaged five on April 4.

The people's liberation army of Luang Namtha Province, displaying a spirit of brave fighting, on March 31, launched a fierce attack on the enemy's Sok Lum outpost and recovered the entire Sok Lum area.

At noon on March 31, the people's liberation army of Luang Namtha Province launched a fierce attack on the Sok Lum outpost. The liberation army soldiers, braving American aircraft bombing, repelled the enemy reinforcements, then quickly tightened the encirclement of the enemy positions, and bravely engaged in hand-to-hand combat with the enemy, annihilating many enemy troops.

In the middle of the night, under the cover of intense artillery fire, the people's liberation army of Luang Namtha Province launched continuous attacks, killing 37 enemy troops, injuring many, and seizing a large number of weapons and ammunition.

The liberation army soldiers, riding on the momentum of victory, pursued the fleeing remnants of the enemy and recovered the entire Sok Lum area, including five villages and several thousand residents.

Sok Lum was originally a liberated area controlled by the Lao People's Party. It was gradually occupied by right-wing troops at the end of 1963. During the occupation, the enemy turned this area into a strategic base for launching gradual attacks on the liberated areas of Luang Namtha Province, committing countless crimes against the local people.

    新华社康开五日电据巴特寮通讯社报道，老挝上寮五个省爱国军民三月份广泛、连续进攻敌人，并开展剿匪斗争，歼灭和瓦解敌人近千名。
    桑怒省爱国军民三月份进行了二十四次英勇的战斗，据不完全统计，共歼灭和瓦解敌人六百名，击落、击毁敌机十三架，缴获各种大炮以及其他武器一百八十件。
    特别值得指出的是，桑怒省爱国军民在三月十日到十三日的战斗中，彻底摧毁了巴提地区的土匪老巢，消灭土匪二百五十名，迫使近二百名土匪投降。
    在这期间，这个省爱国军民解放了一百一十个村庄和将近一万居民。
    琅勃拉邦省爱国军民三月份乘胜出击，共歼灭和瓦解敌人一百四十一名，缴获大批武器、弹药和军用物资。
    丰沙里、琅南塔和沙耶武里等省爱国军民，三月份继续进行反“扫荡”和剿匪战斗，共歼灭和瓦解敌人二百四十九名，击沉汽艇和机动艇九艘，炸毁桥梁一座，缴获各种武器八十六件。
    新华社康开六日电据巴特寮通讯社报道：老挝琅南塔省人民解放军发扬勇敢战斗精神，三月三十一日攻克敌军索光据点，收复了整个索光地区。
    三月三十一日中午，琅南塔省人民解放军向索光据点发起猛烈进攻。解放军战士们冒着美国飞机的轰炸，击退了前来增援的敌军，然后迅速缩紧对敌军阵地的包围圈，英勇地同敌人展开肉搏战，消灭许多敌人。
    半夜，在密集炮火的掩护下，琅南塔省人民解放军又连续发起进攻，打死敌军三十七名，打伤多名，缴获大批武器弹药。
    解放军战士们乘胜追击逃窜的残敌，收复了包括五个村落和数千居民的整个索光地区。
    索光原是老挝爱国战线党控制的解放区。一九六三年底被右派军队蚕食侵占。在占领期间，敌人把这个地区变成向琅南塔省解放区发动蚕食进攻的战略基地，对当地人民犯下了累累罪行。
