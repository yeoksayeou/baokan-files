In the face of unprecedented defeats suffered by U.S. imperialism in the battlefield of South Vietnam and the burgeoning armed struggles of the peoples in some countries of Southeast Asia, the U.S. is in deep crisis over its policy of aggression in Asia. In this situation, the U.S. has rallied some of its satellite countries and is holding a series of meetings in Wellington, New Zealand, to plot new aggressive measures in an attempt to steady its aggressive front, especially in Southeast Asia.

From March 28 to April 5, the following meetings are being held: the military advisory meeting of the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization (SEATO), the SEATO Council meeting, the meeting of the U.S. and its six accomplices in the Vietnam War, and the meeting of the Australia-New Zealand-American (ANZUS) Council.

On March 30, U.S. Secretary of State Dean Rusk, with a gloomy face, said on his way to Wellington: "The situation in Southeast Asia is obviously serious." Recently, the U.S. bourgeois commentator Walter Lippmann had to admit in an article that "America's Asian policy is collapsing." Britain's decision to withdraw its military forces from east of the Suez Canal proves that the U.S. is "completely isolated." The Chicago Sun-Times also pointed out that "the whole of Asia is increasing the pressure on the U.S.," and that the U.S. "Asian policy is full of danger."

It is reported that at these meetings, the U.S. not only demands that its accomplices in the Vietnam War provide more cannon fodder, but also discusses how to fill the "vacuum" left by Britain's withdrawal of its military forces from east of the Suez Canal. However, the U.S. accomplices in the Vietnam War have to consider the risks of being dragged deeper into the Vietnam War by the U.S., and at the same time, due to the burgeoning revolutionary struggles of the people in their own countries, these governments are preoccupied with their own affairs and thus find it difficult to obey the orders of their U.S. master to provide more cannon fodder. This is also reflected in the communiqué issued after the SEATO military advisory meeting. According to the communiqué, the British representative proposed at the meeting that, in view of Britain's withdrawal of its military forces from the region east of the Suez Canal, the nature and scale of Britain's military obligations under the Southeast Asia Treaty must be changed. The representatives of Thailand and the Philippines both mentioned the increasingly developing armed struggles of the people in their countries. Australian Prime Minister Harold Holt recently also said that Australia's "aid" to the U.S. aggression in Vietnam "has been enough" and that Australia cannot take on more obligations. New Zealand's Minister of Defense, Tom Thomson, also said that New Zealand is unlikely to increase or redeploy its troops overseas, whether in Vietnam or other regions.

Given the predicament of U.S. imperialism, even Western newspapers have to point out that the U.S. demand for its satellites to send more troops to South Vietnam will be "coldly received" at the meeting, and that Rusk "faces the arduous task of reviving the flagging morale of the allies."

In addition, U.S. imperialism also intends to use these series of meetings to mend the broken fence of its Southeast Asia Treaty Organization and to bring together fascist military cliques like Suharto's in Indonesia and Rahman's in "Malaysia" to piece together a new military bloc like the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) in Western Europe. However, in the face of the surging revolutionary tide of the peoples of Asia, U.S. imperialism's wishful thinking can only be a delusion of its own. Western bourgeois newspapers have pointed out that the U.S.'s plan is "useless."

As the great leader Chairman Mao has pointed out: "If the U.S. monopoly capitalist group insists on pursuing its policy of aggression and war, it will one day be hanged by the people of the whole world. Other U.S. accomplices will also meet the same fate." The new aggressive plot hatched by U.S. imperialism and its accomplices in Wellington will not be able to save its fate of complete collapse in Asia.

    美帝的任何花招都挽救不了失败的命运
    美帝纠集仆从在惠灵顿策划新侵略阴谋妄图稳住阵脚
    仆从国自顾不暇难于从命　腊斯克供认东南亚局势严重
    新华社二日讯　在美帝国主义在越南南方战场上遭到空前惨败，东南亚地区一些国家的人民武装斗争蓬勃发展，美国在亚洲的侵略政策陷于深刻危机的形势下，美国纠集其一些仆从国家，正在新西兰的惠灵顿举行一系列会议，策划新的侵略措施，妄图稳住它在亚洲、特别是东南亚的侵略阵脚。
    从三月二十八日开始到四月五日为止的这一连串会议是：东南亚侵略集团的军事顾问会议，东南亚集团理事会会议，美帝及其六个侵越帮凶的会议和美、澳、新集团理事会会议。
    美国国务卿腊斯克三月三十日在动身去惠灵顿时愁眉苦脸地说：“东南亚的局势显然是严重的。”美国资产阶级评论员李普曼最近在一篇文章里不得不承认：美国的“亚洲政策正在垮台”，英国决定从苏伊士运河以东撤退它的军事力量，就证实了美国“完全处于孤立”。美国《芝加哥太阳时报》也指出，“整个亚洲到处都在增加（对美国的）压力”，美国的“亚洲政策充满危险”。
    据报道，美国在这些会议上不但将要求它的侵越仆从为侵越战争提供更多炮灰，而且还将要求讨论如何填补英国撤退它在苏伊士运河以东的军事力量后遗留的“真空”。但是，美国的侵越仆从既要考虑更深地被美国牵进侵越战争将会涉及的风险，同时，由于本国人民革命斗争的蓬勃发展，又使这些国家的当局自顾不暇，因此难以遵从其美国主子的命令提供更多炮灰。东南亚集团军事顾问会议以后发表的公报，也说明了这一点。据公报说，英国代表在会议上提出，鉴于英国将从苏伊士运河以东地区撤退它的军事力量，它对东南亚条约的军事义务的性质和规模必须改变。而泰国和菲律宾的代表在会上则都谈到他们国内日益发展的人民武装斗争。澳大利亚总理戈顿最近也表示，澳大利亚对美国侵越战争提供的“援助”“已经够了”，不能再承担更多的义务。新西兰国防部长汤姆逊也说，新西兰很少可能增加或重新部署它在海外的部队，不管是在越南或其他地区都是这样。
    鉴于美帝国主义的这种处境，甚至西方报刊也不得不指出，美国要仆从国家向南越增兵的要求在会上将受到“冷遇”，腊斯克“面临着重振盟国衰败的士气的艰巨任务”。
    除此以外，美帝国主义还想通过这一系列的会议，修补它支离破碎的东南亚条约组织的篱笆，并且把印尼苏哈托法西斯军人集团和“马来西亚”拉赫曼集团等等网罗到一起，拼凑象西欧北大西洋集团那样的新的军事集团。但是，在亚洲各国人民的革命风起云涌的今天，美帝国主义的这种如意算盘，只能是它自己的一个主观妄想。西方资产阶级报刊指出，美国的这种打算是“无用的”。
    正如伟大领袖毛主席英明指出的：“美国垄断资本集团如果坚持推行它的侵略政策和战争政策，势必有一天要被全世界人民处以绞刑。其他美国帮凶也将是这样。”美帝国主义纠集它的帮凶在惠灵顿策划的新的侵略阴谋，决挽救不了它在亚洲彻底覆灭的命运。
