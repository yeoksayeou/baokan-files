Revolutionary workers at the Beijing New China Printing Factory, with the help of the People's Liberation Army's leftist support personnel, have closely combined various tasks with in-depth and sustained revolutionary criticism, effectively promoting the thought revolutionization of the workers. Revolution and production are thriving.

According to a Xinhua News Agency report dated April 25, the revolutionary workers of the Beijing New China Printing Factory, under the guidance of the People's Liberation Army's leftist support personnel, have closely followed Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment. They have taken class struggle as the key, closely combined various tasks, and carried out in-depth and sustained revolutionary criticism. This has effectively promoted the implementation of Chairman Mao's latest instructions, making Mao Zedong's proletarian revolutionary line deeply rooted in people's hearts. The political and ideological faces of the workers have undergone profound changes. The entire factory is experiencing a great situation of revolution and production.

Great leader Chairman Mao recently pointed out deeply: "The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is, in essence, a great political revolution under the conditions of socialism, where the proletariat opposes the bourgeoisie and all exploiting classes. It is the continuation of the long-term struggle between the Communist Party of China and the broad revolutionary masses led by it, and the Kuomintang reactionaries. It is the continuation of the class struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie." The People's Liberation Army's leftist support personnel stationed in the Beijing New China Printing Factory and the revolutionary workers of the factory, in combination with the experience of carrying out revolutionary criticism in the previous period, have seriously studied and discussed Chairman Mao's latest instructions. They have deeply felt from their personal experiences that to carry this political revolution of the proletariat against the bourgeoisie and all exploiting classes to the end, it is necessary to remember Chairman Mao's teaching of "never forgetting class struggle." They must combine various tasks and carry out revolutionary criticism in-depth and sustained, actively and unceasingly launching attacks on class enemies.

The People's Liberation Army's leftist support personnel in the Beijing New China Printing Factory have, from the beginning, firmly grasped the key of class struggle. After entering the factory in late February this year, they especially emphasized carrying out revolutionary criticism in combination with the specific situation of this factory. At that time, various revolutionary mass organizations in the entire factory were facing the issue of achieving and consolidating revolutionary great unity on the basis of Mao Zedong Thought. Some workers thought that the current issue was to overcome bourgeois factionalism, and revolutionary criticism should be carried out after the revolutionary great unity is consolidated. The People's Liberation Army's leftist support personnel, in response to these active thoughts, repeatedly propagated Chairman Mao's great teaching of "never forgetting class struggle" and the spirit of the New Year editorials of the People's Daily, Red Flag Magazine, and the Liberation Army Daily, which proposed that "revolutionary criticism should be combined with various tasks and carried out in-depth and sustained." They organized workers and their families to hold bitter struggle meetings, eat bitter struggle meals, sing bitter struggle songs, and perform bitter struggle plays, starting from class education to mobilize the masses to severely criticize the bourgeois reactionary line promoted by the Chinese Khrushchev. Through bitter struggle and criticism, the revolutionary masses further deepened their proletarian feelings of limitless love for the great leader Chairman Mao and aroused their boundless hatred for the Chinese Khrushchev. Everyone expressed their determination to resolutely overcome the influence of bourgeois factionalism, unite against the enemy, and criticize the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents thoroughly. Workers Zhang Guangming and Wang Dianzhen, under the influence of the bourgeois reactionary line, formed two factions and would argue as soon as they met, known as the "famous pair" in the entire factory. After experiencing bitter struggle and criticism of the Chinese Khrushchev, both overcame the influence of bourgeois factionalism and raised their proletarian awareness. Zhang Guangming, holding Wang Dianzhen's hand, tears streaming down, said: "Our two families both have a book of blood and tears in the old society. We are both bitter gourds on the same vine. It is Chairman Mao who led us to make a revolution and stand up. The evil Chinese Khrushchev is plotting to restore capitalism, wanting us to suffer twice and endure twice the bitterness, splitting us into two factions and opposing each other. Now I truly understand the great significance of Chairman Mao's teaching of 'within the working class, there is no fundamental conflict of interests.' They both excitedly expressed: "A thousand hates, a million hates, hate the Chinese Khrushchev; a thousand loves, a million loves, love our great leader Chairman Mao!" After eliminating the estrangement, they used their personal experiences to create and perform the literary work "From 'a pair of splits' to 'a pair of reds,'" inspiring and educating everyone.

Revolutionary criticism promoted and consolidated revolutionary great unity. This matter raised the broad revolutionary workers' understanding of the significance and role of revolutionary criticism. They decided to closely combine revolutionary criticism with various tasks and carry it out in-depth and sustained.

In March, the factory accepted an urgent task to typeset Chairman Mao's works, requiring 30 workers to complete it within 15 hours. The workers, with the help of the People's Liberation Army's leftist support personnel, before starting the typesetting, in response to the Chinese Khrushchev and a small handful of counter-revolutionary revisionists' frenzied opposition to the spread of the great Mao Zedong Thought, and their various attempts to suppress the printing of Chairman Mao's works, angrily criticized the heinous deeds of the Chinese Khrushchev and a small handful of counter-revolutionary revisionists. The more they criticized, the more they felt that the Chinese Khrushchev and a small handful of counter-revolutionary revisionists were detestable; they also talked extensively about the urgent feelings of all revolutionary people in China and the world for Mao Zedong Thought, the more they talked, the more they felt it was an honor to print Chairman Mao's works for hundreds of millions of revolutionary people. The workers excitedly said, Chairman Mao taught us: "Whatever the enemy opposes, we must support." The more the Chinese Khrushchev and a small handful of counter-revolutionary revisionists oppose us printing Chairman Mao's revolutionary red book, the more we must print it in large quantities, letting the great red flag of Mao Zedong Thought fly high in all of China and the world! The workers, with their limitless love for the great leader Chairman Mao and their deep hatred for the Chinese Khrushchev, threw themselves into the urgent typesetting of Chairman Mao's works, and as a result, they completed this glorious task in just 9 hours.

The revolutionary workers of this factory felt from the previous period's practice that to make revolutionary criticism deep and sustained, truly achieving the two goals of unceasingly attacking class enemies and continuously promoting the thought revolutionization of workers, they must use the invincible Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon, closely combine revolutionary criticism with various tasks, and run it through the completion of various tasks; at the same time, adopt flexible and varied methods to mobilize the masses as widely as possible, closely combining the criticism of revisionism with the struggle against selfishness.

The workers believed that combining revolutionary criticism with various tasks and running it through the completion of various tasks has the advantage of being able to clarify the significance of each task from the height of class struggle and line struggle, recognize the direction, correct the attitude, and continuously check the problems existing in the work process and propose improvement methods. Finally, it can be summarized from the height of class struggle and line struggle to consolidate achievements. For example, in the process of helping cadres to stand out in the revolution and promoting the revolutionary three-in-one combination, they initially severely criticized the Chinese Khrushchev's bourgeois reactionary line of "striking a large area and protecting a small number" on the cadre issue, making the broad revolutionary workers further understand Chairman Mao's great teachings on correctly handling the two types of different contradictions and "the cadre issue should be handled from education, expanding the scope of education." They used Chairman Mao's five conditions for proletarian revolutionary successors to criticize the Chinese Khrushchev's counter-revolutionary revisionist cadre line, making everyone better grasp the ideological weapon to identify and help cadres, and also making many cadres have a deeper understanding of their own mistakes, enhancing their self-revolutionary consciousness.

Great leader Chairman Mao taught us: "Without destruction, there can be no construction. Destruction is criticism, is revolution. Destruction must be reasonable, and being reasonable is construction. Destruction comes first, and construction is within it." Following Chairman Mao's great teaching, the revolutionary workers of the Beijing New China Printing Factory, when carrying out revolutionary criticism in combination with various tasks, first studied Chairman Mao's relevant teachings, seeing how Chairman Mao said it, thinking about how the Chinese Khrushchev and the small handful of capitalist roaders in the factory did it, and examining how they themselves thought. In this way, they combined the criticism of revisionism with the struggle against selfishness, further clearing the poison of the Chinese Khrushchev's counter-revolutionary revisionist line, and promoting the thought revolutionization of people. In the struggle to expose and eliminate counter-revolutionaries who had infiltrated the revolutionary ranks, the People's Liberation Army's leftist support personnel stationed in the factory first organized everyone to seriously study Chairman Mao's great instructions on class and class struggle, using Mao Zedong Thought to severely criticize the Chinese Khrushchev's advocacy of the "extinction of class struggle" theory, and the factory's small handful of capitalist roaders, following the Chinese Khrushchev's orders, surrendering and recruiting, shielding and using ghosts and snakes.

The Beijing New China Printing Factory, in the activity of carrying out in-depth and sustained revolutionary criticism in combination with various tasks, adopted flexible and varied methods to widely mobilize the masses to actively join the revolutionary criticism battle. It made all the workers in the factory, regardless of gender, age, or cultural level, and regardless of whether they were workers or family members, be able to join the revolutionary criticism battle, fully mobilizing the enthusiasm of the broad revolutionary masses. The revolutionary workers on the publishing and distribution frontline of our country regarded the printing and distribution of Chairman Mao's works as an extremely honorable political task. They, with the highest enthusiasm, the fastest speed, and the best quality, printed and distributed revolutionary books.

    以阶级斗争为纲发动群众开展革命大批判
    用革命的大批判推动各项工作的顺利开展
    北京新华印刷厂革命职工在解放军支左人员帮助下，密切结合各项任务，深入持久地开展革命大批判，有力地促进了职工的思想革命化，革命和生产蓬蓬勃勃
    据新华社二十五日讯　北京新华印刷厂的广大革命职工，在人民解放军支左人员的帮助下，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，以阶级斗争为纲，密切结合各项任务，深入持久地开展革命大批判，有力地推动了毛主席最新指示的落实，毛主席的无产阶级革命路线更加深入人心，职工的政治思想面貌发生了深刻的变化。全厂革命和生产出现了一派大好形势。
    伟大领袖毛主席最近深刻地指出：“无产阶级文化大革命，实质上是在社会主义条件下，无产阶级反对资产阶级和一切剥削阶级的政治大革命，是中国共产党及其领导下的广大革命人民群众和国民党反动派长期斗争的继续，是无产阶级和资产阶级阶级斗争的继续。”驻北京新华印刷厂的人民解放军支左人员和厂里的革命职工，结合前一段时间开展革命大批判的经验，对毛主席这一最新指示进行了认真的学习和讨论。他们从亲身经历中更加深刻地体会到，要把当前这场无产阶级反对资产阶级和一切剥削阶级的政治大革命进行到底，就必须牢记毛主席“千万不要忘记阶级斗争”的教导，结合各项任务，把革命的大批判深入持久地开展下去，主动地、不停顿地向阶级敌人发动进攻。
  紧紧抓住阶级斗争
  这个纲，深入开展
  革命的大批判
    在北京新华印刷厂的人民解放军支左人员，一开始就紧紧抓住了阶级斗争这个纲。他们在今年二月下旬进厂后，就特别强调结合这个厂的具体情况开展革命的大批判。当时，全厂各革命群众组织正面临着在毛泽东思想的原则基础上实现和巩固革命大联合的问题。有些职工认为，眼前的问题是要克服资产阶级派性，革命大批判要等革命的大联合巩固以后才好进行。人民解放军支左人员针对这些活思想，向全厂革命职工反复宣传毛主席“千万不要忘记阶级斗争”的伟大教导和《人民日报》、《红旗》杂志、《解放军报》元旦社论提出的“革命的大批判，要结合各项任务，持久地开展下去”的精神，围绕着当时实现和巩固革命大联合的中心任务，组织职工和家属开忆苦会、吃忆苦饭、唱忆苦歌、演忆苦戏，从阶级教育入手，发动群众狠批中国赫鲁晓夫推行的资产阶级反动路线。通过忆苦和批判，进一步加深了革命群众对伟大领袖毛主席无限热爱的无产阶级感情，激发了他们对中国赫鲁晓夫的无比仇恨。大家纷纷表示要坚决克服资产阶级派性的影响，团结对敌，把中国赫鲁晓夫及其代理人批倒批臭。工人张光明和王殿真两人，在资产阶级反动路线的影响下，分成两派，一见面就吵架，是全厂闻名的“一对崩”。经过忆苦和对中国赫鲁晓夫的大批判，两人都克服了资产阶级派性的影响，提高了无产阶级觉悟。张光明拉着王殿真的手热泪盈眶地说：“我们两家在旧社会都有一本血泪账，我们都是一根藤上的苦瓜，是毛主席领导我们闹革命，翻了身。万恶的中国赫鲁晓夫，阴谋复辟资本主义，想让我们受二遍罪，吃二遍苦，把我们分裂成两派，互相对立。现在我才真正懂得了毛主席的
  ‘在工人阶级内部，没有根本的利害冲突’这一伟大教导的意义。”他们两人激动地表示：千恨万恨，要恨中国赫鲁晓夫；千爱万爱，要爱我们伟大领袖毛主席！他俩消除隔阂以后，用自己的亲身经历编演了文艺节目《从“一对崩”到“一对红”》，启发和教育大家。
      把革命的大批判同各项任务紧密结
  合起来，持久地开展下去
    革命大批判促进和巩固了革命的大联合，这件事情，提高了广大革命职工对革命大批判的意义和作用的认识。他们决心把革命大批判同各项任务紧密结合起来，持久深入地开展下去。
    三月间，厂里接受了一项排印毛主席著作的紧急任务，要求三十个工人在十五个小时以内突击完成。工人们在人民解放军支左人员的帮助下，在排印开始之前，针对中国赫鲁晓夫等一小撮反革命修正主义分子疯狂反对传播伟大的毛泽东思想，千方百计压制印制毛主席著作的滔天罪行，愤怒地批判了中国赫鲁晓夫等一小撮反革命修正主义分子的罪恶行径，越批判越觉得中国赫鲁晓夫等一小撮反革命修正主义分子可恨；他们还大谈特谈全中国、全世界革命人民渴求毛泽东思想的急切心情，越谈越觉得为亿万革命人民印制毛主席著作光荣。工人们激动地说，毛主席教导我们：“凡是敌人反对的，我们就要拥护”。中国赫鲁晓夫等一小撮反革命修正主义分子越是反对我们印制毛主席的革命红宝书，我们越是要大印特印，让毛泽东思想的伟大红旗在全中国、全世界高高飘扬！工人们带着对伟大领袖毛主席的无限热爱和对中国赫鲁晓夫的刻骨仇恨，投入了突击排印毛主席著作的工作，结果只用九个小时就出色地完成了这项光荣任务。
          革命大批判贯穿到各项任务的始终；
      批修要和斗私结合；方式方法要灵活多样
    这个厂的革命职工从前一段的实践中体会到，要使革命大批判做到深入和持久，真正达到不停顿地向阶级敌人进攻和不断促进职工思想革命化这样两个目的，就要以战无不胜的毛泽东思想为武器，同各项任务紧密结合开展革命大批判，并且把革命大批判贯穿到完成各项任务的始终；同时采用灵活多样的方式方法来最广泛地发动群众，把批修和斗私紧密地结合起来。
    职工们认为，把革命大批判同各项任务紧密结合并且贯穿到完成各项任务的始终，这种做法的好处是，可以从阶级斗争和路线斗争的高度上，来明确每项工作的意义，认清方向，端正态度，同时不断检查工作进行中存在的问题和提出改进的办法，最后又从阶级斗争和路线斗争的高度上来总结经验，巩固成绩。例如，他们在帮助干部站出来革命，促进革命三结合的过程中，一开始就狠批了中国赫鲁晓夫在干部问题上“打击一大片，保护一小撮”的资产阶级反动路线，使广大革命职工进一步理解了毛主席关于正确处理两类不同性质的矛盾和“干部问题，要从教育着手，扩大教育面”的伟大教导。他们又以毛主席关于无产阶级革命事业接班人的五项条件，来批判中国赫鲁晓夫的反革命修正主义干部路线，使大家更好地掌握了识别和帮助干部的思想武器，也使许多干部对自己所犯错误的认识更加深刻，增强了自我革命的自觉性。
    伟大领袖毛主席教导我们：“不破不立。破，就是批判，就是革命。破，就要讲道理，讲道理就是立，破字当头，立也就在其中了。”遵照毛主席的这一伟大教导，北京新华印刷厂革命职工在结合各项任务开展革命大批判的时候，首先学习毛主席的有关教导，看一看毛主席是怎样说的，想一想中国赫鲁晓夫和厂里党内一小撮走资派是怎样干的，查一查自己是怎样想的。这样，就把批修和斗私结合了起来，使中国赫鲁晓夫反革命修正主义路线的流毒进一步得到肃清，促进了人的思想革命化。在揭发和清除钻进革命队伍中的反革命分子的斗争中，驻厂人民解放军支左人员就首先组织大家认真学习毛主席关于阶级和阶级斗争的伟大指示，用毛泽东思想来狠批中国赫鲁晓夫鼓吹的“阶级斗争熄灭”论，以及厂里党内一小撮走资派秉承中国赫鲁晓夫的旨意，招降纳叛，包庇和重用牛鬼蛇神的反革命罪行。
    北京新华印刷厂在结合各项任务，深入持久地开展革命大批判的活动中，采用了灵活多样的方式方法，来广泛发动群众积极投入革命大批判的战斗行列。使全厂职工不论男女老少、文化高低，也不论职工或家属，都能够投入革命大批判的战斗，充分调动了广大革命群众的积极性。我国出版、发行战线上的革命职工把印制和发行毛主席著作当作极其光荣的政治任务。他们以最高的热情，最快的速度，最好的质量印制、发行革命宝书。
