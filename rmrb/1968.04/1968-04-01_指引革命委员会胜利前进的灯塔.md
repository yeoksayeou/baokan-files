The revolutionary committees are good. They are good because they implement the organization of Chairman Mao's great teachings: "We must rely on the masses, rely on the People's Liberation Army, and rely on the majority of the cadres." Such a "three-in-one combination" leadership team has unparalleled advantages.

The "three-in-one combination" leadership team integrates the three-eight work style of the army, the hardworking and self-reliant qualities of the working people, and the glorious tradition of our party's connection with the masses, making the revolutionary committee full of revolutionary vigor and showing a vigorous and powerful vitality. We have deeply felt this in our practical work. For example, during the Spring Festival, a handful of class enemies stirred up trouble, engaging in speculation and sabotage of the Cultural Revolution. The municipal revolutionary committee deployed a counterattack on the first day, and on the second day, tens of thousands of revolutionary masses were mobilized to join the battle, fully demonstrating the great power of mass dictatorship. Recently, we have learned from the experience of Beijing and other places, launched a mass movement to closely follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, grasp class struggle, and achieve a "red" city, which has received a warm response from the revolutionary masses of the entire city in just a few days, creating a situation where revolutionary great alliances and three-in-one combinations are consolidated and developed. This was impossible before the Cultural Revolution. Due to the sabotage of the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents, the leadership of the old Hangzhou Municipal Party Committee and Municipal People's Committee was plagued by overlapping institutions, stagnation, and cumbersome procedures; even holding an ordinary meeting required "a large group of people, a large package of materials, and a large set of procedures," often from one office to another, from one cadre to another, unable to effectively mobilize the masses. Looking at the present and thinking about the past, we deeply feel that the revolutionary committee is indeed good.

The "three-in-one combination" revolutionary committee is not only a battle command center but also a "school" that prevents the older generation from becoming detached from the masses and allows the younger generation to be tempered. In this school, the representatives of the army, the revolutionary masses, and the revolutionary cadres all learn from each other, care for each other, love each other, and help each other, greatly promoting ideological revolutionization and powerfully driving everyone to follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment. We have learned from the army representatives about their unlimited loyalty to Chairman Mao, their practical application of Chairman Mao's works, and their noble qualities and valuable experiences of emphasizing proletarian politics. From the representatives of the revolutionary masses, we have absorbed the daring spirit of daring to think, speak, act, and revolutionize. When we have this or that flaw and mistake in our work and have not yet realized it, the military representatives and the representatives of the revolutionary masses promptly help us correct it. After the establishment of the municipal revolutionary committee, there was a period when, due to being busy with affairs, I relaxed my leadership of the city-wide revolutionary criticism. A representative of the revolutionary masses sincerely and sharply criticized me. It was a hit right on the mark, awakening me. I studied Chairman Mao's latest instructions again and could not calm down for a long time. Thinking of the mistakes I made in the past, the fundamental reason was that I did not study Chairman Mao's works well, did not reform my worldview, was aloof from the masses, could not hear the masses' criticism, and could not receive the masses' supervision. This made me deeply feel that with the revolutionary "three-in-one combination," we can obtain the revolutionary supervision of the masses from the bottom up, and we, the leaders of the revolutionary committees, can always adhere to the mass line and be closely connected with the masses, serving the people wholeheartedly.

The great leader Chairman Mao's latest instructions on the revolutionary committees have pointed out the fundamental direction for the construction of all levels of revolutionary committees. We must study them repeatedly, understand them deeply, and implement them resolutely. In practical work, we must earnestly implement Chairman Mao's brilliant instructions, and we are determined to build the Hangzhou Municipal Revolutionary Committee into a battle command center that is high in spirit, emphasizes proletarian politics, is full of revolutionary vigor, is decisive and powerful, and holds high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought!

    指引革命委员会胜利前进的灯塔
    浙江省杭州市革命委员会主任　王子达
    在无产阶级文化大革命节节胜利、各级革命委员会联翩出现的大好形势下，《人民日报》、《红旗》杂志、《解放军报》的重要社论《革命委员会好》，传达了我们最最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席的最新指示：“革命委员会的基本经验有三条：一条是有革命干部的代表，一条是有军队的代表，一条是有革命群众的代表，实现了革命的三结合。革命委员会要实行一元化的领导，打破重叠的行政机构，精兵简政，组织起一个革命化的联系群众的领导班子。”学习毛主席的这一最新指示，回顾杭州市革命委员会成立以来的战斗历程，感到格外亲切，受到了极大的教育和鼓舞。毛主席这一伟大指示，是对各级革命委员会基本经验的最科学、最精辟、最完整、最透彻的总结，是指引各级革命委员会胜利前进的灯塔，是保证新生的革命政权永不变色的最强大的思想武器。
    革命委员会好，好就好在从组织上落实了毛主席的伟大教导：“要相信和依靠群众，相信和依靠人民解放军，相信和依靠干部的大多数。”这样的“三结合”的革命的领导班子，具有无比的优越性。
    革命“三结合”的领导班子，把解放军的三八作风，劳动人民艰苦奋斗的品质和我党联系群众的光荣传统融合在一起，使革命委员会充满革命干劲，显示出朝气勃勃的强大生命力。对于这一点，我们在实际工作中已经有深刻的体会。比如，春节前后，一小撮阶级敌人兴风作浪，大搞投机倒把活动，破坏无产阶级文化大革命，市革命委员会第一天部署反击，第二天就有几万名革命群众动员起来，投入战斗，充分发挥了群众专政的巨大威力。最近，我们学习了北京等地的经验，开展了紧跟毛主席伟大战略部署，狠抓阶级斗争，实现全市“一片红”的群众运动，在短短几天时间内，就得到全市革命群众的热烈响应，出现了巩固和发展革命大联合、革命三结合的轰轰烈烈的局面。这在文化大革命之前是做不到的。由于中国赫鲁晓夫及其代理人作祟，旧杭州市委、市人委的领导班子，搞得机构重叠，死气沉沉，办起事来手续繁杂，拖拖沓沓；就是开一个普普通通的会议，也要“人员一大帮，材料一大包，步骤一大套”，往往是从机关到机关，从干部到干部，不能有力地发动群众。看看现在，想想过去，我们深深地体会到，革命委员会确实是好。
    “三结合”的革命委员会，不仅是一个战斗指挥部，而且是“使前辈人不脱离群众，使青年人得到锻炼”的大学校。在这所大学校里，解放军代表、革命群众代表和革命领导干部代表，大家互相学习，互相关心，互相爱护，互相帮助，大大促进了思想革命化，有力地推动着大家紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署。我们从解放军代表那里学习到他们对毛主席无限忠诚，活学活用毛主席著作，突出无产阶级政治的高贵品质和宝贵经验，从革命群众代表身上吸取敢想、敢说、敢做、敢闯、敢革命的战斗活力。当我们在工作中有了这样那样的缺点和错误，自己还没有觉察的时候，军队代表和革命群众代表就及时帮助我们纠正。市革命委员会建立以后，曾经有一段时期，由于忙于事务，我对全市革命大批判的领导有所放松，一位革命群众代表既诚恳又尖锐地对我提出了批评。真是一针见血，打中了要害，使我猛醒过来。我再次学习了毛主席的最新指示，内心久久不能平静。想起过去自己犯了这样那样的错误，最根本的一条，就是由于没有学好毛主席著作，没有改造好自己的世界观，高高在上，脱离群众，听不到群众的批评，得不到群众的监督。这使我深切体会到，有了革命的三结合，就能得到革命群众自下而上的革命监督，我们革命委员会的领导人员就可以永远坚持群众路线，和群众血肉相联，全心全意为人民服务。
    伟大领袖毛主席关于革命委员会的最新指示，为各级革命委员会的建设指出了根本的方向。我们一定要反复学习，深刻领会，坚决照办。在实际工作中，要认真落实毛主席这一光辉指示，誓把杭州市的革命委员会建设成为高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，突出无产阶级政治，充满革命干劲，雷厉风行，精悍有力的战斗指挥部！
