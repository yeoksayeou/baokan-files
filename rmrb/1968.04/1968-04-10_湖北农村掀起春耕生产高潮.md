The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants, revolutionary masses, and revolutionary cadres in rural Hubei Province are resolutely implementing the great leader Chairman Mao's great line of "grasp revolution, promote production." While vigorously conducting Mao Zedong Thought study classes and carrying out in-depth struggles against selfishness and revisionism, they have launched a spring ploughing and production campaign.

At present, in the early-season areas of eastern and southern Hubei, the young rice seedlings are already a vibrant green. In the cotton-producing areas of the Jianghan Plain, cotton planting has begun. Various water conservancy projects are rushing to complete repairs on schedule and to the required standards. At all levels, revolutionary committees, in leading the spring ploughing and production, place the study, implementation, propagation, and defense of Mao Zedong Thought in the first position. They mobilize the masses to actively learn and apply Mao Zedong Thought, fiercely combat the "private" within their minds, and sweep away various ideological obstacles to spring ploughing and production. This has ignited an indomitable revolutionary spirit, making all production work solid and effective.

    湖北农村掀起春耕生产高潮
    湖北省农村广大贫下中农、革命群众和革命干部，坚决贯彻伟大领袖毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的伟大方针，在大办毛泽东思想学习班，深入开展斗私批修的同时，掀起了春耕生产高潮。
    目前，季节较早的鄂东南，早稻秧苗已经一片嫩绿。江汉平原的产棉区，已经开始播种棉花。各个水利工地正在突击抢修，力争按时按质完成任务。各级革命委员会在领导春耕生产中，把学习、执行、宣传、捍卫毛泽东思想放在第一位，发动群众活学活用毛泽东思想，狠斗头脑中的“私”字，扫除了春耕生产中的各种思想障碍，焕发起冲天的革命干劲，使各项生产工作做得扎扎实实。
