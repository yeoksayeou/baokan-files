The support-left personnel of a certain unit of the Air Force stationed at the First Sanitation Vehicle Factory in Beijing, in accordance with Chairman Mao's great teachings of "never forget class struggle" and "one of our important tasks on the ideological front now is to carry out a criticism of revisionism," have helped the revolutionary committee of this factory to focus on the struggle between the two classes, two lines, and two roads within the factory. They have guided the broad revolutionary masses to combine the criticism of a handful of class enemies within the factory with the criticism of the biggest handful of capitalist roaders within the Party, making the revolutionary criticism deeper and deeper.

After the revolutionary committee of this factory was established in mid-August last year, there was a period of complacency and neglect of class struggle, with everyone busy with production and administrative matters. However, soon the performance of the class enemies sounded the alarm. A handful of ghosts and snakes tried every means to incite some people's bourgeois factionalism and anarchism, and created disputes within the revolutionary committee, engaging in splittist activities. These class enemies also colluded with some deceived masses to fiercely compete for production power, attempting to strangle the revolutionary committee with production and make it ineffective and collapse.

The support-left personnel seized these living examples of class struggle, organized the members of the revolutionary committee to study Chairman Mao's teaching of "never forget class struggle," and led everyone to discuss. Everyone realized that the reason for the complacency was mainly that the "theory of the extinction of class struggle" of the Chinese Khrushchev had not been thoroughly criticized and rooted out, and the concept of class and class struggle had not taken root in their minds. Many comrades said: class struggle consciousness and line struggle consciousness will not naturally arise in one's mind, and various rightist conservative thoughts will not automatically retreat from one's mind. Chairman Mao teaches us: "Without destruction, there can be no construction; without blocking, there can be no flow; without stopping, there can be no progress." If we do not thoroughly criticize the "theory of the extinction of class struggle" spread by the Chinese Khrushchev and thoroughly eliminate its poison in our minds, the concept of class struggle will not take deep root in our minds. We will be deaf and blind to the life-and-death class struggle around us. Many comrades deeply felt: if we do not criticize the biggest handful of capitalist roaders within the Party deeply, we will not be able to see clearly the handful of class enemies around us. To consolidate the newly born revolutionary committee and carry the political revolution to the end, we must criticize the biggest handful of capitalist roaders within the Party deeply and thoroughly!

With the help of the support-left personnel, the factory revolutionary committee used the living examples of class struggle within the factory to mobilize and organize the revolutionary masses of the entire factory to use Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon to severely criticize the "theory of the extinction of class struggle" of the Chinese Khrushchev, and to expose the harmfulness of forgetting class struggle, making the revolutionary criticism develop vigorously. Through the criticism of the "theory of the extinction of class struggle," the revolutionary masses of the entire factory opened their eyes and raised their class struggle and line struggle consciousness. Under the leadership of the revolutionary committee, they launched a fierce attack on a handful of class enemies within the factory.

After a handful of class enemies within the factory were exposed, the revolutionary committee led the revolutionary masses of the entire factory to carry out face-to-face struggles against them. However, the support-left personnel found that some masses, when criticizing, only paid attention to exposing the facts of these bad guys' sabotage activities, but were not good at linking them with the Chinese Khrushchev for criticism. The support-left personnel then helped the revolutionary committee to organize the broad masses to repeatedly study Chairman Mao's teachings: "The fundamental contradiction that the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution aims to resolve is the contradiction between the bourgeoisie and the proletariat, between the capitalist road and the socialist road." Everyone realized that the biggest handful of capitalist roaders within the Party, led by the Chinese Khrushchev, are the representatives of the reactionary forces attempting to restore capitalism in our country. They are the backers of the capitalist roaders in various regions and units, as well as the landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists, and the traitors and spies hidden within the revolutionary ranks. To carry the struggle between the two classes, two lines, and two roads within the unit to the end, we must carry the struggle to criticize the biggest handful of capitalist roaders within the Party, led by the Chinese Khrushchev, to the end. In the struggle and criticism of a handful of class enemies around us, if we do not closely link it with the criticism of the biggest handful of capitalist roaders within the Party, the root will not be uprooted.

After the broad revolutionary masses raised their consciousness, the level of criticism and struggle against class enemies improved significantly. For example, some old workers, when criticizing the sabotage activities of the reactionary bourgeois elements within the factory, through a comparison of past and present, on the one hand exposed the various crimes of this guy, and on the other hand linked his crimes with the "theory of the extinction of class struggle" and the fallacies of "exploitation has merit" and "capitalists have great merits and small sins" advocated by the Chinese Khrushchev, and carried out a combined criticism. This method not only overthrew the enemy around us but also criticized the Chinese Khrushchev to the point of being unbearable. Revolutionary workers said: the Chinese Khrushchev and the class enemies in the factory are two toads on the same string. Under the powerful fire of the revolutionary criticism, neither can escape! We must grab the black vine and uproot the black root, and wipe them out all at once!

### 狠批中国赫鲁晓夫挖掉黑根  揭露一切阶级敌人斩断黑线  北京第一清洁车辆厂革命大批判同本单位阶级斗争紧密结合越搞越深入

    狠批中国赫鲁晓夫挖掉黑根  揭露一切阶级敌人斩断黑线
    北京第一清洁车辆厂革命大批判同本单位阶级斗争紧密结合越搞越深入
    本报讯　空军某部驻北京第一清洁车辆厂支左人员，遵照毛主席“千万不要忘记阶级斗争”和“我们现在思想战线上的一个重要任务，就是要开展对于修正主义的批判”的伟大教导，帮助这个厂的革命委员会大抓厂内两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的斗争，引导广大革命职工把批判身边的一小撮阶级敌人同批判党内最大的一小撮走资派紧密结合起来，使革命大批判越搞越深入。
    这个厂的革命委员会在去年八月中旬成立以后，一度产生了和平麻痹思想，放松了抓阶级斗争，一天到晚埋头抓生产，忙事务。可是不久，阶级敌人的表演就给他们敲了警钟。一小撮牛鬼蛇神，千方百计煽动某些群众的资产阶级派性和无政府主义，并在革命委员会内部制造纠纷，大搞分裂活动。这一小撮阶级敌人还拉拢一些受蒙蔽的群众拚命争夺生产大权，妄想用生产卡革命委员会的脖子，把革命委员会架空、搞垮。
    支左人员抓住这些活生生的阶级斗争现实，组织革命委员会成员学习毛主席“千万不要忘记阶级斗争”的教导，引导大家展开讨论。大家认识到，产生和平麻痹思想的原因，主要是对中国赫鲁晓夫的“阶级斗争熄灭”论没有批深批透，阶级和阶级斗争的观念没有在头脑里扎根。许多同志说：阶级斗争觉悟和路线斗争觉悟，不会在头脑里自然产生，形形色色的右倾保守思想也不会自动地从头脑里退出。毛主席教导我们：“不破不立，不塞不流，不止不行”。如果我们不彻底批判中国赫鲁晓夫散布的“阶级斗争熄灭”论，不彻底肃清它在自己头脑里的流毒，阶级斗争的观念就不会在头脑里深深扎根，我们就会对身边你死我活的阶级大搏斗听而不闻，视而不见。不少同志深有感受地说：对党内最大的一小撮走资派批不深，对身边的一小撮阶级敌人就看不准。我们要巩固新生的革命委员会，把这场政治大革命进行到底，非把党内最大的一小撮走资派批深批透不可！
    在支左人员的帮助下，厂革命委员会利用厂内阶级斗争的活生生的事例，发动和组织全厂革命群众以毛泽东思想为武器，狠批中国赫鲁晓夫的“阶级斗争熄灭”论，大摆忘记阶级斗争的危害性，使革命大批判轰轰烈烈地开展起来。通过对“阶级斗争熄灭”论的批判，全厂革命群众擦亮了眼睛，提高了阶级斗争和路线斗争觉悟，在革命委员会的带领下，向厂内一小撮阶级敌人发动了猛烈进攻。
    厂内一小撮阶级敌人被揪出来以后，革命委员会带领全厂革命群众对他们开展了面对面的斗争。但是，支左人员发现有些群众在批判时，只注意揭发这些坏家伙进行破坏活动的事实，而不善于把他们同中国赫鲁晓夫联系起来进行批判。支左人员便帮助革命委员会组织广大群众反复学习毛主席的教导：“无产阶级文化大革命所要解决的根本矛盾，是无产阶级和资产阶级两个阶级，社会主义和资本主义两条道路的矛盾。”大家认识到，以中国赫鲁晓夫为首的党内最大的一小撮走资派，是妄图在我国复辟资本主义的反动势力的总代表，是各地区、各单位走资派和地富反坏右，以及隐藏在革命队伍内部的叛徒、特务的总后台。要把本单位的两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的斗争进行到底，就必须把批判以中国赫鲁晓夫为首的党内最大的一小撮走资派的斗争进行到底。在斗争、批判身边的一小撮阶级敌人的时候，不和批判党内最大的一小撮走资派紧密地联系起来，老根就挖不掉。
    广大革命群众认识提高以后，对阶级敌人批判和斗争的水平有了很大提高。例如，有些老工人在批斗厂内的反动资产阶级分子的破坏活动时，通过今昔对比，一方面揭露了这个家伙的种种罪行，一方面把他的罪行和中国赫鲁晓夫鼓吹的“阶级斗争熄灭”论和“剥削有功”、“资本家功大罪小”等谬论，结合起来进行批判。这样的作法，不仅斗倒了身边的敌人，同时也把中国赫鲁晓夫批得臭不可闻。革命职工说：中国赫鲁晓夫和厂里的阶级敌人是拴在一根线上的两个蚂蚱，在革命大批判强大炮火下，哪个也跑不掉！我们就是要揪住黑藤挖黑根，把他们一锅端掉！
