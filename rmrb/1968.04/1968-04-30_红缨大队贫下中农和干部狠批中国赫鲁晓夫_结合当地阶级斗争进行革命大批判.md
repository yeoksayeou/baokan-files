The poor and lower-middle peasants and cadres of Hongying Brigade in Baoli Commune, Changtu County, Liaoning Province, have been following the great leader Chairman Mao's teaching, "Never forget class struggle," closely linking the revolutionary criticism and denunciation with the actual class struggle in their locality, and conducting a thorough and sustained revolutionary criticism and denunciation. This has strengthened and consolidated the dictatorship of the proletariat, greatly raised the poor and lower-middle peasants' and revolutionary cadres' awareness of class struggle and line struggle, and brought about a great change in their spiritual outlook.

	Linking Revolutionary Criticism and Denunciation with Local Class Struggle to Strengthen and Consolidate the Dictatorship of the Proletariat

	The revolutionary criticism and denunciation in this brigade, under the leadership of the brigade cadres and the militia company, has been developing continuously. When the revolutionary criticism and denunciation just began, the brigade leaders and the militia company commander believed that to carry it out well, they must first arm the masses with Chairman Mao's teachings on class struggle. Therefore, they organized the poor and lower-middle peasants and the militia to repeatedly study Chairman Mao's teaching, "Class struggle, a good grasp of it yields marvelous results," and Vice Chairman Lin's instruction, "If you do not understand what exploitation is, you do not understand revolution." They also organized everyone to recall past sufferings and compare them with present happiness, to exhibit the evidence of the class enemies' attempt to stage a comeback, and to display the situation of the struggle between the two headquarters. They used the invincible Mao Zedong Thought and the living facts of class struggle to criticize and denounce the Chinese Khrushchev's advocacy of the theory of the extinction of class struggle, making everyone further realize the complexity and sharpness of class struggle under new historical conditions, understand the relationship between criticizing the Chinese Khrushchev and consolidating the dictatorship of the proletariat, and know that to thoroughly overthrow the Chinese Khrushchev, one must thoroughly purge his poisonous influence. After a period of study, the poor and lower-middle peasants' awareness was greatly raised. They, with strong class hatred towards the Chinese Khrushchev and a handful of capitalist roaders within the Party, launched a high tide of revolutionary criticism and denunciation.

	Since revolutionary criticism and denunciation is a class struggle, it is bound to encounter resistance. Just as the revolutionary criticism and denunciation was developing deeply, a few landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists who had not been reformed jumped out, some attempting to reverse verdicts, others conspiring to usurp the leadership of the brigade.

	Why did the landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists jump out when criticizing the Chinese Khrushchev? The brigade and militia company leaders, with this question in mind, studied Chairman Mao's teaching: "They are not reconciled to the country's demise and communism. They are always studying strategies to counter us, 'peering into the direction,' seeking an opportunity to make a comeback. Sometimes they will 'lie down and play dead,' waiting for a chance to 'counterattack.' They have long experience in class struggle, and they will wage various forms of struggle—legal and illegal. We revolutionary Party members must understand their tricks, study their strategies, and defeat them." They followed Chairman Mao's teaching, studied and analyzed how the class enemies 'peered into the direction' to make a comeback and how they waged various forms of struggle. They also displayed the crimes committed by the landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists in the struggle between the two classes, two roads, and two lines over the past more than ten years since liberation, making everyone see clearly that the handful of capitalist roaders within the Party and the landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists who had not been reformed had always been in collusion and in response to each other. The Chinese Khrushchev blew black wind from above, and they stirred up evil waves from below. When the Chinese Khrushchev slashed the cooperatives, a rich peasant element shouted, "The cooperativization has gone wrong, it was too early, it has made us poor," inciting the masses to pull out horses and withdraw from the cooperatives. When the Chinese Khrushchev advocated "three autonomies and one contract" and "four freedoms," a landlord element jumped out and brazenly attacked the three red banners. During the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the Chinese Khrushchev implemented the bourgeois reactionary line of "striking a large number and protecting a few" in the cadre issue, and the landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists fanned the evil wind and took the opportunity to strike and frame revolutionary cadres. In short, when the Chinese Khrushchev beat the drum on the stage, they clapped their hands below. Everyone clearly realized that the Chinese Khrushchev was the black backer of the landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists, and the landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists were the social base of the Chinese Khrushchev. They had common interests. They relied on each other and used each other, with the common goal of restoring capitalism.

	After raising their awareness, the brigade and militia company leaders linked the criticism of the Chinese Khrushchev with the struggle against the landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists who had not been reformed. They criticized and struggled against all the landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists in the entire brigade who had not been reformed. Their method was: expose one crime of the landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists, and criticize one fallacy of the Chinese Khrushchev. For example, exposing the crime of landlords and rich peasants' brutal exploitation of peasants, they criticized the Chinese Khrushchev's theory of "exploitation is meritorious"; exposing the crime of the landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists attempting to stage a comeback and reverse verdicts, they criticized the Chinese Khrushchev's theory of the extinction of class struggle. In this way, linking class struggle with revolutionary criticism and denunciation, they effectively struck the enemy, educated the masses, and greatly strengthened and consolidated the dictatorship of the proletariat in the brigade.

	Severely Criticize and Denounce the Chinese Khrushchev's Black Program for Restoring Capitalism in the Countryside, Making Him Never Be Able to Stage a Comeback

	After severely criticizing and denouncing the Chinese Khrushchev's theory of the extinction of class struggle, they opened up a breakthrough for the revolutionary criticism and denunciation. The brigade and militia company leaders then focused on the Chinese Khrushchev's "three autonomies and one contract" and "four freedoms," deeply exposing and criticizing them.

	In the criticism, they, aiming at the community members' active thoughts, mainly conducted positive education on the struggle between the two roads to the community members, using the "Three Articles" and Chairman Mao's brilliant expositions on socialism and communism as weapons, guiding the community members to use their personal experiences to expose the Chinese Khrushchev's wolfish ambition in advocating "three autonomies and one contract" and "four freedoms." Chairman Mao taught, "Only socialism can save China." Through study, everyone realized that the socialist road is the lifeline and the road to happiness for the poor and lower-middle peasants. The community members, with Mao Zedong Thought as a sharp weapon, displayed the Chinese Khrushchev's crimes of slashing cooperatives, advocating hiring workers to exploit, and "exploitation is meritorious," and the more they displayed, the more indignant everyone became. Some said, the Chinese Khrushchev is our mortal enemy. The revisionist black goods he advocated are to push us back into the deep sea of the old society, making the landlords and rich peasants ride on our heads again. If we do not purge his poisonous influence, we will walk the old road of the old society again. Everyone recalled the scene of polarization in the countryside before cooperativization, where some added cars and horses, built houses and bought land, hired workers to exploit, while some poor peasants lost their land again and lived in poverty. Such a comparison made the community members understand Chairman Mao's great teaching, "Only socialism can save China," more deeply, and they hated the Chinese Khrushchev's advocacy of "three autonomies and one contract" and "four freedoms" even more, and their initiative to carry out revolutionary criticism and denunciation was higher. The militia members and cadres took the lead in struggling against selfishness and purging the poisonous influence of "three autonomies and one contract" and "four freedoms" in their minds. Everyone said, exposing our selfishness is to criticize the Chinese Khrushchev and purge his poisonous influence; the deeper his poisonous influence, the more evil the Chinese Khrushchev is. Linking the criticism of revisionism with the struggle against selfishness, the masses saw the Chinese Khrushchev's poisonous influence clearly, touched it, hated it thoroughly, criticized it deeply, and promoted the revolutionary criticism and denunciation to develop more deeply.

	Deeply Carry Out Revolutionary Criticism and Denunciation, Wage a "People's War" to Bury Revisionism

	The revolutionary criticism and denunciation quickly penetrated into the community members' families. The militia platoon leader of the third team, Liu Fengchun, first initiated the establishment of a family Mao Zedong Thought study class, setting up a battlefield for struggling against selfishness and criticizing revisionism at home. Liu Fengchun's father is a poor peasant with deep bitterness, who recounted the family's history of suffering, giving the whole family a profound class education and further raising their awareness of the struggle between the two classes, two roads, and two lines. Liu Fengchun's sister-in-law and younger brother also criticized the Chinese Khrushchev's theory of "public ownership with private benefits" in the family Mao Zedong Thought study class and exposed their selfishness, purging the Chinese Khrushchev's poisonous influence. Even Liu Fengchun's elderly mother denounced the Chinese Khrushchev's crime of advocating the theory of the extinction of class struggle, saying, "This is the Chinese Khrushchev using a soft knife to kill people. If we are not vigilant, we will lose our heads, our families will flee, and the country will suffer." The revolutionary criticism and denunciation turned this elderly woman, who used to only take care of chickens, ducks, pigs, and geese, into an active element who cares about state affairs and struggles against selfishness and criticizes revisionism everywhere. The brigade and militia company leaders, seeing the achievements of Liu Fengchun's family in struggling against selfishness and criticizing revisionism, realized the great significance of doing a good job in family struggle against selfishness and criticism of revisionism, and promptly promoted their family's experience, also letting Liu Fengchun go to various production teams and communes to spread the experience, making the brigade and commune establish many family Mao Zedong Thought study classes.

	The result of the deep development of revolutionary criticism and denunciation was a resounding victory in a "people's war" to bury revisionism, bringing about a profound change in the poor and lower-middle peasants' and community members' spiritual outlook. In the past, when a family gathered together, they often talked about idle things, but now, in this brigade, a family often discusses how to struggle against selfishness and criticize revisionism. The community members expressed that in the future, they will hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, closely follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, continuously carry out revolutionary criticism and denunciation, and unswervingly implement Chairman Mao's great instruction to "struggle against selfishness and criticize revisionism," carrying the struggle between the two classes, two roads, and two lines through to the end.

    红缨大队贫下中农和干部狠批中国赫鲁晓夫
    结合当地阶级斗争进行革命大批判
    新华社沈阳二十八日电　辽宁省昌图县宝力公社红缨大队遵循伟大领袖毛主席“千万不要忘记阶级斗争”的教导，紧密结合当地两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线斗争的实际，深入持久地开展革命大批判，巩固和加强了无产阶级专政，贫下中农和革命干部的阶级斗争和路线斗争觉悟也有很大提高，精神面貌有了很大变化。
      把革命大批判同当地的阶级斗争实际
  紧密结合起来，巩固和加强无产阶级专政
    这个大队的革命大批判，在大队干部和民兵连的领导下，一直在不断深入地发展。革命大批判刚开始搞起来的时候，大队的领导和民兵连长认为，要把这场大批判搞好，必须首先用毛主席关于阶级斗争的教导把群众武装起来。于是，他们组织贫下中农和民兵反复学习毛主席“阶级斗争，一抓就灵”的教导和林副主席“不懂得什么是剥削，就不懂得革命”的指示，还组织大家忆苦思甜，展览阶级敌人妄图变天的罪证，大摆两个司令部的斗争情况，用战无不胜的毛泽东思想和活生生的阶级斗争事实，来批倒批臭中国赫鲁晓夫鼓吹的“阶级斗争熄灭”论，使大家进一步认识到在新的历史条件下阶级斗争的复杂性和尖锐性，认识到批判中国赫鲁晓夫和巩固无产阶级专政的关系，认识到要彻底打倒中国赫鲁晓夫，就要彻底肃清他的流毒。贫下中农经过一段时间的学习，认识有了很大提高，他们带着对中国赫鲁晓夫等党内一小撮走资派的强烈阶级仇恨，掀起了革命大批判的高潮。
    革命的大批判既然是一场阶级斗争，就必然会遇到抵抗。正当革命大批判深入发展的时候，有几个没有改造好的地、富、反、坏、右分子跳了出来，他们有的妄图翻案，有的阴谋篡夺大队的领导权。
    批判中国赫鲁晓夫，为什么地、富、反、坏、右分子跳了出来？大队和民兵连的领导干部带着这个问题学习毛主席的教导：“他们对于亡国、共产是不甘心的。”“他们老是在研究对付我们的策略，‘窥测方向’，以求一逞。有时他们会‘装死躺下’，等待时机，‘反攻过去’。他们有长期的阶级斗争经验，他们会做各种形式的斗争——合法的斗争和非法的斗争。我们革命党人必须懂得他们这一套，必须研究他们的策略，以便战胜他们。”他们遵照毛主席的教导，研究、分析了阶级敌人是怎样“‘窥测方向’，以求一逞”的，又是怎样进行各种形式的斗争的，并且大摆解放后十几年来在两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线斗争中，地、富、反、坏、右的罪行，使大家看清了党内一小撮走资派和没有改造好的地、富、反、坏、右分子，一直是互相勾结，互相呼应的。中国赫鲁晓夫在上面吹黑风，他们就在下面掀恶浪。当中国赫鲁晓夫大砍合作社时，有一个富农分子就大叫大嚷：“合作化搞糟了，搞早了，搞穷了”，煽动群众拉马退社。中国赫鲁晓夫鼓吹“三自一包”、“四大自由”时，一个地主分子跳出来猖狂地公开攻击三面红旗。在无产阶级文化大革命中，中国赫鲁晓夫在干部问题上推行“打击一大片，保护一小撮”的资产阶级反动路线，地、富、反、坏、右分子就煽阴风，借机打击陷害革命干部。总之，中国赫鲁晓夫在台上敲锣，他们就在台下鼓掌。大家清楚地认识到，中国赫鲁晓夫是地、富、反、坏、右的黑后台，地、富、反、坏、右是中国赫鲁晓夫的社会基础。他们有着共同的利害关系。他们互相依靠，互为利用，目的都是搞资本主义复辟。
    认识提高以后，大队和民兵连的领导就把批判中国赫鲁晓夫同斗争没有改造好的地、富、反、坏、右分子结合起来。他们对全大队没有改造好的地、富、反、坏、右分子都进行了批判斗争。他们的做法是：揭发地、富、反、坏、右一种罪行，批判中国赫鲁晓夫一条谬论。比如，揭发地主富农残酷剥削农民的罪行，就批判中国赫鲁晓夫的“剥削有功”论；揭发地、富、反、坏、右分子妄图变天翻案的罪行，就批判中国赫鲁晓夫的“阶级斗争熄灭”论。这样联系阶级斗争实际进行革命大批判，有力地打击了敌人，教育了群众，大大加强和巩固了大队的无产阶级专政。
      批臭中国赫鲁晓夫在农村复辟资本
  主义的黑纲领，叫他永世不得翻身
    批臭了中国赫鲁晓夫的“阶级斗争熄灭”论，打开了革命大批判的突破口，大队和民兵连的领导又着重抓住中国赫鲁晓夫“三自一包”“四大自由”的黑货，深揭猛批。
    在批判中，他们针对社员的活思想，着重向社员群众进行两条道路斗争的正面教育，以“老三篇”和毛主席关于社会主义和共产主义的光辉论述为武器，引导社员用亲身经历的事实，戳穿中国赫鲁晓夫鼓吹“三自一包”“四大自由”的狼子野心。毛主席教导说：“只有社会主义能够救中国”。通过学习，大家认识到社会主义道路是贫下中农的救命路、幸福路。社员们以毛泽东思想为锐利武器，大摆中国赫鲁晓夫大砍合作社、鼓吹雇工剥削、“剥削有功”等罪行，大家越摆越气愤。有的说，中国赫鲁晓夫是我们的死对头，他搞的那一套修正主义黑货，就是要把我们推进旧社会的苦海深渊，让地主富农重新骑在我们的头上，不肃清他的流毒，我们就会重走旧社会的老路。大家回忆了合作化前农村出现的两极分化情景，有的人添车买马，置房置地，雇工剥削，而有的翻身农民又失掉土地，过着贫困的生活。这样一对比，社员们对毛主席“只有社会主义能够救中国”这一伟大教导，理解得更深刻了，对中国赫鲁晓夫推行“三自一包”“四大自由”更加仇恨，开展革命大批判的自觉性更高了。民兵、干部又带头斗私，肃清自己头脑中“三自一包”
  “四大自由”的流毒。大家说，亮咱们的私是为了批判中国赫鲁晓夫，肃清他的流毒；他的流毒越深，说明中国赫鲁晓夫越坏。把批修和斗私结合起来，群众对中国赫鲁晓夫的流毒看得清，摸得着，恨得透，批得深，促使革命的大批判更加深入地开展了起来。
      深入开展革命的大批判，打一场埋
  葬修正主义的“人民战争”
    革命的大批判，很快深入到了社员的家庭。三排民兵排长刘凤春首先发起办家庭毛泽东思想学习班，在家里摆开斗私批修的战场。刘凤春的父亲是个苦大仇深的老贫农，他讲了苦难的家史，使全家人受到一次深刻的阶级教育，更提高了两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线斗争的觉悟。刘凤春的嫂嫂和弟弟，都在家庭毛泽东思想学习班上，批判了中国赫鲁晓夫的“大公有私”论，并且亮私斗私，肃清中国赫鲁晓夫的流毒。连刘凤春的老母亲也控诉了中国赫鲁晓夫鼓吹“阶级斗争熄灭”论的罪行，她说：“这是中国赫鲁晓夫在用软刀子杀人，再不警惕就要人亡头，家逃荒，国遭殃。”革命大批判使这位一向只管鸡猪鹅鸭的老人，变成处处关心国家大事，斗私批修的积极分子。大队和民兵连领导从刘凤春一家斗私批修的成果中，看到搞好家庭斗私批修的重大意义，就及时推广他们一家的经验，还让刘凤春到各生产队和公社去传播经验，使大队和公社都办起了许多家庭毛泽东思想学习班。
    革命大批判深入开展的结果，打响了一场埋葬修正主义的“人民战争”，贫下中农和社员群众的精神面貌起了深刻的变化。过去一家人到一起说闲话的时候多，现在，这个大队里一家人常常谈论的是怎样斗私批修。社员们表示，今后要更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，不断深入地开展革命的大批判，坚定不移地执行毛主席“要斗私，批修”的伟大指示，把两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的斗争进行到底。
