Over the past year, under the brilliant guidance of the invincible Mao Zedong Thought and the great leader Chairman Mao's directive that "revolutionary committees are good," revolutionary committees at various levels in our province have been established one after another amidst the storm and stress of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. Recently, the provincial revolutionary committee has been successfully established amidst a great situation both domestically and internationally. This is a great victory for Mao Zedong Thought! This is a great victory for Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line!

"With Chairman Mao's wave of the hand, we march forward!" For places and units that have not yet established revolutionary committees, they must resolutely follow Chairman Mao's latest instructions, ride the momentum of the establishment of the provincial revolutionary committee, muster great efforts, strive to be the best, and quickly establish "three-in-one" temporary power organs to welcome the entire province turning red!

Rapidly establishing revolutionary committees at various levels is a need to further deepen class struggle and line struggle, a need to achieve a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and also a need for the development of the domestic and international situation. This is Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment and also the urgent demand of the revolutionary masses. "When the masses are not yet aware, if we attack, that is adventurism.... When the masses demand progress, if we do not advance, that is right opportunism." If we do not accelerate the realization of revolutionary great unity and promote revolutionary "three-in-one" in the current great situation, we will fall behind the situation and commit right opportunist errors.

The current key to rapidly establishing revolutionary committees at various levels is to take Chairman Mao's latest instructions as the guideline, firmly stand on Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, fight selfishness, criticize revisionism, overcome bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism and anarchism, enhance proletarian party spirit, and accelerate revolutionary great unity and revolutionary "three-in-one."

    紧跟毛主席就是胜利
    一年多来，在战无不胜的毛泽东思想的光辉照耀下，在伟大领袖毛主席“革命委员会好”的伟大指示指引下，我省各级革命委员会迎着无产阶级文化大革命的急风暴雨，一批又一批地建立起来了。最近，省革命委员会又在国内外一派大好形势下胜利诞生。这是毛泽东思想的伟大胜利！这是毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的伟大胜利！
      “毛主席挥手我前进！”目前还没有建立革命委员会的地方和单位，都要坚决按照毛主席的最新指示，乘省革命委员会建立的东风，鼓足干劲，力争上游，尽快建立
  “三结合”的临时权力机构，迎接全省一片红！
    迅速建立各级革命委员会，这是进一步深入开展阶级斗争、路线斗争的需要，是夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的需要，也是国内外形势发展的需要；这是毛主席的伟大战略部署，也是革命群众的迫切要求。“当着群众还不觉悟的时候，我们要进攻，那是冒险主义。……当着群众要求前进的时候，我们不前进，那是右倾机会主义。”在当前的大好形势下不去加速实现革命大联合，推进革命“三结合”，那我们就要落在形势的后面，犯右倾的错误。
    迅速建立各级革命委员会，当前的关键是要以毛主席的最新指示为纲，坚定地站在毛主席的无产阶级革命路线上，斗私，批修，克服资产阶级、小资产阶级派性和无政府主义，增强无产阶级党性，加速革命的大联合和革命的“三结合”。　《浙江日报》
