    Somali President Sheikh Mukhtar Mohamed Hussein issued a statement in Cairo on the 15th, strongly condemning Israel's aggression against Arab countries and those countries that support Israel by providing it with modern weapons and equipment. President Hussein said that Israel's aggression in the Middle East should be seen as a threat to world peace and security. Israel's arrogance has now reached its peak.

    He reaffirmed that the Somali government fully supports the just struggle of the Arab people against Israeli aggression.

    Hussein also announced: "Somalia condemns the South African regime that practices apartheid, Portuguese imperialism in Angola and Mozambique, and the fascist regime of the white minority led by Smith in (Southern) Rhodesia."

    President Hussein left Cairo on the morning of the 15th after a four-day visit to the United Arab Republic. During his stay in Cairo, he had several meetings with UAR President Nasser.
