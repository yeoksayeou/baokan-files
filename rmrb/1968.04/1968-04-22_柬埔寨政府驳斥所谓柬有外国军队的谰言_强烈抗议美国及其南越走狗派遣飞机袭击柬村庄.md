Cambodian Government Refutes Rumors of Foreign Troops in Cambodia
Strongly Protests U.S. and South Vietnamese Puppets Sending Planes to Attack Cambodian Villages

	NEW DELHI, April 20 (Xinhua) -- The Cambodian News Agency reported on April 19 that the Royal Government of Cambodia issued a statement refuting the rumors of foreign troops in Cambodia.

	The statement expressed surprise that Canadian Prime Minister Lester B. Pearson would say, "The International Control Commission cannot provide more specific information on the issue of 'Communist troops infiltrating Cambodia.'" The statement pointed out that all recent investigation reports by the International Control Commission have consistently concluded that there is no evidence to suggest the presence of so-called Communist troops in Cambodia, and Canada has representatives participating in this commission.

	The statement reiterated that the Royal Government of Cambodia has never allowed any foreign troops to be stationed or to pass through Cambodian territory. It is proven that what exists in Cambodia is the invasion of American troops and South Vietnamese puppet forces into its borders.

	NEW DELHI, April 20 (Xinhua) -- According to a report from the Cambodian News Agency, the Foreign Ministry of the Kingdom of Cambodia issued two protest notes on April 16 and 17, strongly protesting the recent two instances where the U.S. and its South Vietnamese puppets sent planes to invade Cambodian airspace and attack Cambodian villages.

	The two protest notes pointed out that on March 15 and April 2 of this year, U.S.-South Vietnamese armed forces' helicopters and other aircraft successively invaded the airspace of Cambodia's Takeo Province and attacked Cambodian residents who were working, injuring four people. The notes stated that this is a deliberate act of aggression by the U.S.-South Vietnamese puppet regime against Cambodia.

	On April 16 and 17, the Cambodian Foreign Ministry successively handed over these two protest notes to the French Embassy in Phnom Penh for delivery to the U.S., and handed over identical protest notes to the Australian Embassy in Phnom Penh for delivery to the Saigon puppet government.

    柬埔寨政府驳斥所谓柬有外国军队的谰言
    强烈抗议美国及其南越走狗派遣飞机袭击柬村庄
    新华社金边二十日电  柬埔寨新闻社十九日发表柬埔寨王国政府的一项声明，驳斥所谓在柬埔寨有外国军队的谰言。
    声明对加拿大总理皮尔逊竟然说出“国际监督委员会不能够对关于‘共产党军队渗入柬埔寨’这一问题提供更具体的情况”这样的话表示惊讶。声明指出，国际监督委员会最近的所有调查报告得出的一致结论是：没有任何证据足以说明在柬埔寨有所谓共产党的军队，而加拿大是有代表参加这个委员会的。
    声明重申，柬埔寨王国政府从来不允许任何外国军队驻扎或经越柬埔寨领土。事实证明，在柬埔寨存在的是美国军队和南越伪军对它的边境的侵犯。
    新华社金边二十日电据柬埔寨新闻社报道：柬埔寨王国政府外交部四月十六日和十七日先后两次发出照会，强烈抗议美国及其南越走狗最近两次派遣飞机侵犯柬埔寨领空，袭击柬埔寨村庄的新的侵略罪行。
    这两份抗议照会指出，今年三月十五日和四月二日，美国—南越武装部队的直升飞机和其他飞机先后侵入柬埔寨柴桢省上空，并用机枪和火箭袭击正在劳动的柬埔寨居民，打伤四人。照会指出，这是美国—南越傀儡集团蓄意对柬埔寨进行的新的侵略行为。
    柬埔寨外交部十六日和十七日先后把这两份照会交由法国驻金边大使馆转交美国，并把内容相同的照会交由澳大利亚驻金边大使馆转交西贡傀儡政府。
