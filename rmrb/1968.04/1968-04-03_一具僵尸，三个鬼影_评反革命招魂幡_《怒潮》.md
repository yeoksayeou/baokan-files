Our great leader Chairman Mao personally directed the significant historical event of the Lushan Conference, exposing the counter-revolutionary ambitions and schemes of Peng Dehuai, removing his position and dismissing his rank. However, the class enemy is not willing to accept defeat; they constantly attempt to rise again and return. In 1962, when China's Khrushchev was fiercely promoting the restoration of capitalism, Peng Dehuai's accomplices and black literati immediately released the reactionary film *Stormy Waves*.

The creators of the reactionary film *Stormy Waves* wanted to rehabilitate Peng Dehuai but were afraid of being exposed. To deceive the public, they cleverly attached the political ghost of Peng Dehuai to the characters Huang Weiguo, Qiu Jin, and Luo Dacheng.

Huang Weiguo is a Nationalist reactionary military officer with blood on his hands, but in the film, he is glorified as a hero who evolves from sympathizing with the revolution to joining it. During the severe white terror of the Nationalists, he protected a party leader from danger and eventually jumped out of the tiger's den to "defect" to the revolutionary forces. It is clear that the film's authors went to great lengths to beautify this counter-revolutionary executioner to cover up Peng Dehuai's counter-revolutionary crimes. Everyone knows that Peng Dehuai was originally a Nationalist warlord and a counter-revolutionary executioner against the people. It was only due to internal conflicts within the Nationalists that he was forced to join the revolutionary forces with the motive of "investing." If we look into Peng Dehuai's past, we can clearly see that the film's beautification of Huang Weiguo is a beautification of Peng Dehuai. Peng Dehuai's accomplices and their henchmen attempted to reverse his counter-revolutionary history into a revolutionary history, singing his "praise" and "virtues," thereby preparing public opinion for his rehabilitation.

The second incarnation of Peng Dehuai's ghost is the very active protagonist Qiu Jin.

Peng Dehuai once instructed his propagandists to portray him as a "son of the peasants." The master spoke, and the servants understood. Thus, in *Stormy Waves*, a "peasant leader" Qiu Jin emerged. Look, how "heroic" this Qiu Jin is! He cleverly used the watermelon strategy, effortlessly capturing a class of enemy guns. He also set up an ambush, wiping out a Nationalist bandit army completely. In the battle to attack Liujia Bridge and the "February Storm," he bravely led the charge, appearing so "brave." In reality, during the "February Storm," Peng Dehuai was still carrying out his counter-revolutionary activities in the Nationalist bandit army, and there was no trace of Peng Dehuai in the peasant uprising army of the "February Storm." But the film, to beautify the warlord Peng Dehuai as a "peasant leader," confused right and wrong by linking the "February Storm" with the July Pingjiang Uprising that Peng Dehuai was forced to participate in. This was used to highlight the "Pingjiang Uprising," thereby secretly portraying Peng Dehuai, who had nothing to do with the peasant uprising, as a "brave" "peasant leader," playing a trick to deceive heaven and earth.

The third incarnation of Peng Dehuai's ghost is Luo Dacheng. The film's creators describe him as making decisive actions and turning the tide in difficult situations during the severe setbacks of the revolution. However, because he dared to defy the special envoy of the Party Central, he was eventually "persecuted" and "dismissed." The story of Luo Dacheng being dismissed is a plot that the film's creators added after the Lushan Conference. At the Lushan Conference, Peng Dehuai directly attacked our great leader Chairman Mao and the Party Central. Thus, the film describes Luo Dacheng's argument with the Party Central's special envoy. At the Lushan Conference, Chairman Mao and the Party Central dismissed Peng Dehuai's position. Immediately, the film wrote about Luo Dacheng being dismissed by the Party Central's special envoy. From this, it is clear what the film's creators intend. The authors attempted to use the description of Luo Dacheng's "unjust case" in the film to cry out for Peng Dehuai, thereby trying to overturn the case of the Lushan Conference.

What is particularly intolerable is that when Luo Dacheng was forced to go to the Party Central for self-criticism and leave the troops, the film blatantly sang the theme song through the old fisherman: "Sending you off to the riverbank, there are so many heartfelt words unsaid, sailing through winds and waves, I hold the fishing rod and wait for your return." What a "waiting for your return"! On the screen, Luo Dacheng's body is Peng Dehuai's spirit in reality. Peng Dehuai, this criminal counter-revolutionary who attempted to seize military power, was overthrown, and the revolutionary people rejoiced. However, a small group of counter-revolutionary revisionists hiding in dark corners, chirping and unable to bear the sunlight, gathered under the black flag of China's Khrushchev, crying day and night, waiting for the "return" of their "lord." Gentlemen of counter-revolutionary revisionism, now is the time for the people to judge you. Your fishing rod has been taken away, and your "lord" can never return.

"Asking the plague lord where he is going, paper boats and bright torches light up the sky." Now, *Stormy Waves*, this banner for summoning spirits for the counter-revolutionary military usurper Peng Dehuai and howling for the restoration of capitalism, has finally met its doom in the surging waves of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, along with their masters, accomplices, and servants. We must hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and further expose and criticize the poisonous weed *Stormy Waves* thoroughly! Criticize it down and stink it up!

    一具僵尸，三个鬼影
    评反革命招魂幡——《怒潮》
    战斗英雄　舒积成
    我们伟大领袖毛主席亲自主持的具有重大历史意义的庐山会议，揪出了反党大野心家、大阴谋家彭德怀，撤了他的职，罢了他的官。但阶级敌人并不甘心失败，他们时时企图东山再起，卷土重来。一九六二年，正当中国赫鲁晓夫大刮翻案风，妄图复辟资本主义的时候，彭德怀的死党及其黑秀才们立即抛出了反动影片《怒潮》。
    反动影片《怒潮》的炮制者，既要为彭德怀翻案，但又怕被人揪住。他们为了遮人耳目，巧妙地把彭德怀这具政治僵尸的阴魂，附着在黄维国、邱金、罗大成三个人物身上。
    黄维国，是个双手沾满人民鲜血的国民党反动军官，但在影片中却被美化成为从同情革命到走向革命的英雄人物。在国民党白色恐怖的严重时刻，他掩护了党的负责人脱险，最后竟然独身跳出虎穴，“起义”到革命队伍来了。很清楚，影片作者所以要拚命为这个反革命刽子手涂脂抹粉，正是为了掩盖彭德怀的反革命罪恶史。大家知道，彭德怀原来就是个国民党的军阀、反共反人民的刽子手，只是由于国民党的内部矛盾，他才被迫带着“入股”的动机，钻到革命队伍里来了。我们翻一翻彭德怀的老底，就可以清楚地看到影片美化黄维国，正是美化彭德怀。彭德怀死党及其娄罗们妄图把他的反革命历史颠倒为革命历史，为他歌“功”颂“德”，从而为他翻案作舆论准备。
    彭德怀阴魂的第二个化身，就是那个非常活跃的主角邱金。
    彭德怀曾经嘱咐他的吹鼓手，要把自己写成“农民的儿子”。主子开口，奴才们心领神会，于是在《怒潮》中就跳出了一个“农民领袖”邱金。瞧，这个邱金何等“英雄”呵！他巧施西瓜计，不费吹灰之力，缴了敌人一个班的枪。又布置埋伏，把一支国民党匪军装进了口袋，消灭得一干二净。在攻打刘家桥，在“二月扑城”的战斗中，他冒着枪林弹雨，冲在最前面，显得多么“勇敢”。其实“二月扑城”时，彭德怀还在国民党匪军里干他的反革命勾当，在“二月扑城”的农民起义军中，根本找不到彭德怀的影子。但影片为了把彭德怀这个军阀美化为“农民领袖”，竟然混淆黑白地把“二月扑城”同七月彭德怀被迫参加的“平江起义”扯在一起，用来衬托“平江起义”，从而偷偷地把与农民起义根本沾不上边的彭德怀打扮成“作战勇敢”的“农民领袖”，耍出了一个瞒天过海的鬼把戏。
    彭德怀阴魂的第三个化身就是罗大成。影片的炮制者描写他在革命受到严重挫折的困难情况下，当机立断，力挽狂澜。但是因为他敢于顶撞党中央的特派员，最后竟遭到了“迫害”而被“罢官”。罗大成被罢官的故事情节，是影片炮制者在党的庐山会议后特意加上去的。在庐山会议上，彭德怀直接攻击我们伟大的领袖毛主席和党中央，于是影片就描写了罗大成同党中央特派员的抗辩。庐山会议上毛主席和党中央罢了彭德怀的官，于是影片马上就写罗大成被党中央特派员罢了官。由此可见，影片炮制者的用心何在，不是一清二楚吗？作者妄图通过影片中罗大成被罢了官这一“冤案”的描写，来替彭德怀鸣“冤”叫“屈”，从而为彭德怀翻庐山会议的案。
    特别令人不能容忍的是，当罗大成被迫去党中央检讨而离开队伍时，影片又通过渔鼓老人露骨地唱出了主题歌：“送君送到江水边，知心话儿说不完，风里浪里你行船，我执梭标望君还”。好一个“望君还”！银幕上罗大成之身，就是现实中彭德怀之魂。彭德怀这个罪恶累累的反党篡军头目被斗倒了，革命人民拍手称快，而躲在阴暗角落里嘁嘁喳喳、见不得阳光的一小撮反革命修正主义分子，麇集在中国赫鲁晓夫的黑旗之下，一把鼻涕一把泪，日日夜夜望“君”还。反革命修正主义分子先生们，现在是人民审判你们的时刻到了，你们反人民的梭标已被剥夺，你们的“君”再也望不还了。
    “借问瘟君欲何往，纸船明烛照天烧。”现在《怒潮》这个为反党篡军的大野心家彭德怀翻案、为资本主义复辟嚎叫的招魂幡，终于连同他们的主子、帮凶、奴才们，在无产阶级文化大革命的澎湃怒潮中，遭到灭顶之灾。我们一定要更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，进一步把《怒潮》这株大毒草批深批透，批倒批臭！
