Chairman Mao's wave forward, I advance
Model platoon supporting the left and loving the people

	“Waves surge in the four seas, winds and thunder shake the five continents.”
	In the new era of revolution under the great banner of Mao Zedong Thought, amidst the triumphant songs of the Chinese people's complete victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, our great leader Chairman Mao issued the "Statement Supporting the Black People in the United States in Their Just Struggle Against Violence." Chairman Mao's statement is a powerful ideological weapon against imperialism, modern revisionism, and the reactionaries of all countries. It profoundly points out the contradiction between the broad masses of black people in the United States and the ruling clique of the United States, which is a class contradiction, and wisely indicates the direction of the struggle for liberation by the black people in the United States. Chairman Mao's statement has dealt a heavy blow to U.S. imperialism and its lackeys.

	Chairman Mao teaches us: "All reactionary forces on the verge of extinction always struggle desperately against the revolutionary forces." The brutal persecution of black people by U.S. imperialism has sparked a new storm of struggle against violence by black people in the United States. The racial discrimination in the United States is a product of colonialism and imperialism. We are firmly convinced that colonialism, imperialism, and all exploitative systems will be thoroughly overthrown. All oppressed peoples and nations in the world will achieve thorough liberation. No matter how U.S. imperialism and its lackeys struggle, they cannot stop the march of history.

	Chairman Mao's great statement expresses the common will and firm resolve of the 700 million people of our country to support the struggle of black people in the United States against violence. It speaks the hearts of our revolutionary fighters. Chairman Mao supports, I support; Chairman Mao directs, I carry out; Chairman Mao waves forward, I advance!

	We pledge to be the strong backing for the struggle of our black brothers in the United States and all oppressed peoples and nations for freedom and liberation. We must achieve a complete victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and build our country into an even more consolidated and powerful base for world revolution, making our due contribution to the world revolution.

	The struggle of black people in the United States is not only a struggle for freedom and liberation by the oppressed and exploited black people but also a new call to arms for the entire oppressed and exploited people of the United States against the brutal rule of the monopoly capitalist class. It is a great support and encouragement for the struggle of the people of the world against U.S. imperialism and for the struggle of the Vietnamese people against U.S. imperialism. I represent the Chinese people in expressing firm support for the just struggle of black people in the United States.

    毛主席挥手我前进

    “四海翻腾云水怒，五洲震荡风雷激。”
    在世界进入了以毛泽东思想为伟大旗帜的革命新时代，在我国人民夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的凯歌声中，我们的伟大领袖毛主席发表了《支持美国黑人抗暴斗争的声明》。毛主席的声明，是反对帝国主义、现代修正主义和各国反动派的强大思想武器。它深刻地指出了美国广大黑人同美国统治集团之间的矛盾，是阶级矛盾，英明地指出了美国黑人争取解放斗争的方向。毛主席的声明，给美帝国主义及其帮凶们以沉重的打击。
    毛主席教导我们：“凡属将要灭亡的反动势力，总是要向革命势力进行最后挣扎的”。美帝国主义对美国黑人进行的残酷迫害，激起了美国黑人抗暴斗争的新风暴。美国的种族歧视，是殖民主义、帝国主义制度的产物。我们坚信，殖民主义、帝国主义和一切剥削制度，必将彻底崩溃。世界上一切被剥削、被压迫人民、被压迫民族必将获得彻底解放。美帝国主义及其帮凶们无论怎样挣扎，也阻止不了历史车轮的前进。
    毛主席的伟大声明，表达了我国七亿人民支援美国黑人抗暴斗争的共同意志和坚强决心，说出了我们革命战士的心里话。毛主席支持我支持，毛主席指示我照办，毛主席挥手我前进！
    我们誓做美国黑人兄弟和一切被剥削、被压迫人民、被压迫民族争取自由解放的斗争的坚强后盾。我们一定要夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利，把我国建设成为更加巩固、更加强大的世界革命的根据地，为世界革命作出应有的贡献。
    美国黑人的斗争，不仅是被剥削、被压迫的黑人争取自由解放的斗争，而且是整个被剥削、被压迫的美国人民反对垄断资产阶级残暴统治的新号角。它对于全世界人民反对美帝国主义的斗争，对于越南人民反对美帝国主义的斗争，是一个巨大的支援和鼓舞。我代表中国人民，对美国黑人的正义斗争，表示坚决的支持。
