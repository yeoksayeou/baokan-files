	Tokyo, April 13 (New China News Agency) — More than 9,000 people from various sectors in Okinawa Prefecture held a rally and demonstration near the U.S. Kadena Air Base on the evening of April 12 to protest the deployment of U.S. B-52 bombers to the base. They angrily shouted, "Get the U.S. B-52 bombers out of Okinawa!" "Oppose U.S. imperialism's aggression in Vietnam!" "Down with the pro-American, traitorous Sato government!" A statement passed at the rally emphasized, "We will continue our struggle until all U.S. military bases in Okinawa are completely withdrawn."

	After the rally, participants held up banners and shouted anti-American slogans as they marched in protest. A contingent of patriotic students marched towards the Kadena base and bravely fought against 500 fascist police who came to suppress them. Another contingent of patriotic students quickly rushed to the gate of the Kadena base. They faced fully armed U.S. aggressor troops and courageously held a one-hour protest rally.
