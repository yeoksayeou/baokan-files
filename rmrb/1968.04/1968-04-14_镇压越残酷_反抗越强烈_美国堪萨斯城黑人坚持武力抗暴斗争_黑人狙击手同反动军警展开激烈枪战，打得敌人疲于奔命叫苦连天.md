The armed resistance against oppression by black residents of Kansas City, Missouri, which began on April 9, had lasted for four days and nights by April 12. Black snipers bravely and cleverly fired at reactionary police and military, making more than 4,000 reactionary police and military forces run around in confusion and cry in pain.

Following the intense gun battle throughout the night of April 10, groups of angry black residents took to the streets at dawn on April 11, smashing and burning some shops owned by white exploiters.

On the night of April 11, black snipers again engaged in fierce gun battles with fascist police. Some black snipers fired from rooftops or windows, while others fired from cars, moving quickly and leaving the large number of reactionary police confused and disoriented. Black snipers also concentrated their fire on the police command post in the East City black residential area, wounding several members of the "National Guard" and police, frightening the reactionary police so much that they turned off all the lights and hid under cars.

Facing the brave and tenacious resistance of the black residents, the reactionary authorities were extremely panicked. They mobilized a large number of police and military forces to brutally suppress the black residents. In a few days, six black residents were shot dead, and more than 600 were arrested.

However, the bloody suppression could not extinguish the flames of struggle by the black residents of Kansas City against racial oppression and for equal rights. On the night of April 12, despite the strict curfew across the city, gunshots from black snipers and blazing fires could still be heard and seen.

In cities like Chicago, Baltimore, and others, the armed resistance of black residents continued.

    美国堪萨斯城黑人坚持武力抗暴斗争
    黑人狙击手同反动军警展开激烈枪战，打得敌人疲于奔命叫苦连天
    新华社十三日讯　华盛顿消息：美国密苏里州堪萨斯城黑人群众九日掀起的武力抗暴斗争，到十二日晚上已经坚持了四个昼夜。黑人狙击手英勇机智地向反动军警射击，打得四千多名反动军警疲于奔命，叫苦连天。
    继十日整个晚上同反动军警的激烈枪战后，十一日黎明一群群愤怒的黑人又涌上街头，捣毁和焚烧白人剥削者的一些商店。
    十一日夜晚，黑人狙击手又同法西斯军警展开了激烈的枪战。有的黑人狙击手从屋顶或窗口开枪射击反动军警，有的从汽车里开枪，他们打了就走，把大批反动军警打得晕头转向。黑人狙击手还集中火力射击设在东城黑人居住区的警察指挥所，打伤“国民警卫队”和警察数名，吓得反动警察关掉了全部灯光，趴在汽车下面躲命。
    面对着黑人群众英勇顽强的抗暴斗争，反动当局十分恐慌。他们出动大批军警，对黑人群众进行了残暴的镇压。几天来，六名黑人被他们开枪打死，六百多人横遭逮捕。
    然而，血腥镇压扑不灭堪萨斯黑人群众反对种族压迫、争取平等权利的斗争烈火。十二日晚上，尽管全城宵禁森严，仍然不断有黑人狙击手的枪声和熊熊的火光。
    在芝加哥、巴尔的摩以及其他一些城市，黑人的武力抗暴斗争，也仍在继续进行。
