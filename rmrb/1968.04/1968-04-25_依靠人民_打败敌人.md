The red flag of Phou Pha Thi is flying high, and victory reports are frequently coming from the banks of the Mekong River. Under the leadership of the Lao Patriotic Front, the heroic Lao patriotic military and people, following the great victory at Nam Bao, have continued to advance, seizing the last important stronghold of American imperialism and its lackeys in the Bathe region, planting the flag of liberation throughout the entire Bathe region. Recently, news of the Lao people's victories has been continuously coming from the upper, middle, and lower regions of Laos. The Lao people's war of resistance against American aggression is rapidly developing and advancing towards victory.

In the American imperialists' plan to invade Southeast Asia, Laos is seen as a region of great strategic importance. The American aggressors have always wanted to turn Laos into a military base for invading China and Vietnam. For more than a decade, American imperialism has first aided France in invading Laos, and then replaced France, directing and aiding the Lao reactionary and traitorous clique to launch a counter-revolutionary civil war. The United States has also continuously sent large numbers of American military personnel to directly command the Lao reactionary army to massacre the Lao people, using tactics such as "air superiority," "sweeping," "encirclement," and so on.

However, the heroic Lao people, with their brave and resolute fighting, have repeatedly dealt heavy blows to the American aggressors and their lackeys, continually foiling the enemy's war plots. The Lao people's armed forces are fighting more bravely and becoming stronger with each battle, firmly grasping the initiative in the war. Initially, they could only eliminate small numbers of enemies. Now, they can wipe out entire battalions and companies of enemies. In 1967 alone, the Lao patriotic military and people eliminated nearly 16,000 enemies; in the first quarter of this year, they have already annihilated more than 7,200 enemies. Currently, the Lao patriotic armed forces have liberated more than one million people and two-thirds of the country's territory.

Chairman Mao pointed out: "Regardless of the size of a country, as long as the people are fully mobilized and firmly rely on the people to wage a people's war, any powerful enemy can be defeated." The Lao people's war of resistance against American aggression is indeed a people's war. From the mountains to the plains, from the forests to the valleys, the Lao patriotic armed forces are roaming freely, eliminating enemies. The Lao people's children—the People's Liberation Army—are everywhere supported and backed by the people. They firmly rely on the masses, with an unyielding heroic spirit, overwhelming the enemy, and winning victory after victory.

Through long-term struggle with the enemy, the Lao people have seen through the savage nature of American imperialism and the paper tiger essence of its lackeys. They are neither afraid of the enemy's planes and cannons nor believe in the enemy's sweet words. Facing the American imperialists' two-faced counter-revolutionary tactics, they remain vigilant, strengthen their fighting spirit, and repeatedly foil the enemy's plots and tricks.

Heroic Lao brothers and sisters! Your struggle is our struggle, your victory is our victory. We are exhilarated and cheer for each of your victories! We firmly support you until you achieve the final victory in the war of resistance against American aggression!

    依靠人民  打败敌人
    中国人民解放军某部　武毅
    富科特山红旗漫卷，湄公河畔捷报频传。英雄的老挝爱国军民在老挝爱国战线党的领导下，继南博大捷之后，又乘胜前进，一举拔除了美帝国主义及其走狗在巴堤地区的最后一个重要据点，把解放的旗帜插遍整个巴堤地区。最近，老挝人民胜利的消息，从上、中、下寮各省不断传来。老挝人民的抗美救国战争，正在迅速发展，胜利前进。
    在美帝国主义侵略东南亚的计划中，老挝被看作一个具有重要战略意义的地区。美国侵略强盗一向要把老挝变为侵略中国和越南的军事基地。十几年来，美帝国主义先是援助法国侵略老挝，后又取代法国，指使和援助老挝卖国反动集团发动反人民内战。美国还不断增派大批美国军事人员，直接指挥老挝反动军队屠杀老挝人民，什么“空中优势”呀，“扫荡”呀，“蚕食”呀……，都用上了。
    然而，英雄的老挝人民以英勇坚决的战斗，一次又一次地给予美国侵略者及其走狗以沉重的打击，不断粉碎敌人的战争阴谋。老挝人民武装越战越勇，越战越强，牢牢掌握战争主动权。起初，他们只能少量地消灭敌人。现在，已能一举把整营整连的敌人吃掉。一九六七年一年中，老挝爱国军民消灭敌人近一万六千人；仅今年第一季度就歼灭敌人达七千二百多人。目前，老挝爱国武装力量已解放了一百万以上的人口和三分之二的国土。
    毛主席指出：“国家不分大小，只要充分动员人民，坚决依靠人民，进行人民战争，任何强大的敌人都是可以打败的。”老挝人民的抗美救国战争正是一场人民战争。从山区到平原，从森林到河谷，老挝爱国武装力量纵横驰骋，消灭敌人。老挝人民的子弟兵——人民解放军，处处受到人民的拥护和支持。他们紧紧依靠人民群众，以一往无前的英雄气概压倒敌人，赢得一个又一个的胜利。
    老挝人民经过同敌人的长期斗争，看透了美帝国主义穷凶极恶的强盗本性和外强中干的纸老虎本质。他们既不惧怕敌人的飞机大炮，也不相信敌人的甜言蜜语。面对美帝国主义的反革命两手，他们提高警惕，加强战斗，一次又一次地粉碎敌人的阴谋诡计。
    英雄的老挝兄弟们！你们的斗争就是我们的斗争，你们的胜利就是我们的胜利。我们为你们的每一个胜利而振奋，而欢呼！我们坚决支持你们，直到取得抗美救国战争的最后胜利！
