The various ethnic minority poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres in Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, with the help of the People's Liberation Army, have further emphasized proletarian politics, extensively launched a mass movement to study and apply Chairman Mao's thoughts, and implemented Chairman Mao's latest instructions. They have used Mao Zedong Thought to guide production. In the previous period, the region experienced low temperatures and rain. The various ethnic minority poor and lower-middle peasants, remembering Chairman Mao's teachings on "seizing the opportunity to grasp the key links in production to achieve greater successes than last year," overcame various difficulties, braved the rain to level fields and repair irrigation canals, and actively prepared for spring ploughing and sowing. Now, Guangxi has launched a spring ploughing production campaign, and everywhere is bustling with a thriving scene.

    广西壮族自治区春耕生产一片蓬勃景象
    广西壮族自治区各族贫下中农、革命干部，在人民解放军的帮助下，进一步大力突出无产阶级政治，广泛地掀起活学活用毛泽东思想，落实毛主席最新指示的群众运动，用毛泽东思想统帅生产，指导生产。前段时间，这里低温阴雨，各族贫下中农牢记毛主席关于“不失时机地掌握生产环节，取得比去年更大的成绩”的教导，克服种种困难，冒雨耙田、修渠，积极进行备耕和春耕、春播工作。现在，广西掀起了春耕生产高潮，到处是一片蓬蓬勃勃的繁忙景象。（据新华社）
