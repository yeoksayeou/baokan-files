    Terminology Explanations

    Gold Standard: Also known as the gold coin standard. Under this system, gold coins can be freely minted, banknotes can be freely exchanged for gold coins, and gold can be freely imported and exported. By the late 19th century, most capitalist countries had adopted this system. After the capitalist world economic crisis of 1929-1933, they all successively abandoned the gold standard. The gold standard that French President Charles de Gaulle now advocates is not the same as the past gold standard. Instead, it is a system that eliminates the special status of the dollar and pound as international reserve currencies and implements a monetary system where gold is used as a reserve and settlement medium.

    Gold Exchange Standard: Also known as the "paper gold standard." Under this system, gold coins are not used domestically, and the issued paper currency cannot be exchanged for gold. However, foreign exchange is supplied without restriction. Countries that implement this system maintain a fixed exchange rate between their currency and the currency of another gold standard country and hold a large amount of foreign exchange reserves in that country to sell foreign exchange as needed. After World War I, countries like Germany and Italy used foreign loans as foreign exchange reserves to implement the gold exchange standard.

    Currently, the monetary system of the capitalist world is one that is close to the gold exchange standard. Countries issue paper currency domestically, but the paper currency cannot be exchanged for gold. Their paper currencies mostly maintain a fixed exchange rate with the dollar and pound. These paper currencies also use a certain amount of dollars, pounds, or gold as reserves.

    International Payments Deficit: When a country's total capital outflow exceeds its capital inflow in a year, it is said to have an international payments deficit. A country's payments can be divided into trade payments and non-trade payments. The latter mainly includes international investment, profits, freight, insurance, travel, and military expenses. Some countries experience an international payments deficit due to a large trade deficit, while others experience it due to a non-trade deficit, such as large military expenditures and capital outflows abroad, as is the case with the United States.

    International Reserve Currency: Under the gold standard, the paper currencies issued by capitalist countries are backed by a certain amount of gold. This gold is collectively referred to as the reserve for the paper currency. After World War II, many capitalist countries, due to economic damage, lacked gold, while the dollar and pound became internationally recognized means of circulation and were treated as equivalents of gold. Therefore, countries in the capitalist world all used dollars and pounds as reserves for international settlements, and some countries used a certain amount of dollars and pounds as guarantees for issuing paper currency. Thus, the dollar and pound are both called international reserve currencies.

    名词解释
    金本位制　又名金币本位制。在这种制度下金币可以自由铸造，银行券可以自由兑换金币，黄金可以自由输出入。十九世纪末期，大部分资本主义国家采用这种制度。一九二九——一九三三年资本主义世界经济危机后，它们都相继放弃了金本位制。法国总统戴高乐现在主张恢复的金本位制，并不是过去的金本位制，而是一种取消美元、英镑为国际储备货币特殊地位、实行以黄金为储备和清算手段的货币制度。
    金汇兑本位制　也叫“虚金本位制”。这种制度在国内不行使金币，发行的纸币也不能兑换黄金，而对外则无限制供应外汇。实行这种制度的国家，把本国货币同另一金本位国家的货币保持固定比价，并在这个国家存放大量外汇基金，以便随时出售外汇。第一次世界大战后，德国、意大利等国用国外借款作为外汇基金，实行金汇兑本位制。
    目前资本主义世界的货币制度是一种接近于金汇兑本位制的制度。各国在国内发行纸币，但纸币不能兑换黄金。它们的纸币大都同美元、英镑保持固定比价。这些纸币也以一定数量的美元、英镑或黄金作储备。
    国际收支逆差　一个国家在一年内它的全部资金流出超过了资金流入，就叫出现了国际收支逆差。一个国家的收支可以分贸易收支和贸易以外的收支两种。后者主要包括国际间的投资、利润、运费、保险费、旅行费、军费等开支。有的国家出现国际收支逆差是因为出现了巨大贸易亏空，有的则是由于贸易以外的收支亏空，例如由国外庞大军事开支和资本输出造成，如美国就是。
    国际储备货币　在金本位制下，资本主义各国发行的纸币都以一定数量的黄金作为担保。这笔黄金通称为纸币的储备。第二次世界大战后，许多资本主义国家因经济受到破坏，缺少黄金，而美元、英镑又成为国际间公认的流通手段，被当作黄金的等价物，因此资本主义世界各国都把美元、英镑作为用于国际结算的储备，也有一些国家，把一定数量的美元、英镑当作它们发行纸币的保证。这样，美元、英镑就都被称为国际储备货币。
