The Lao Patriotic Military and People Achieved Glorious March Victories, Eliminating and Disbanding 1,700 Enemies, Liberating Over 30,000 Residents

KHANGKHAY, April 6 (Xinhua) — According to a report from the Pathet Lao News Agency, the General Staff of the Lao People's Liberation Army issued a March battle report on April 4, summarizing the glorious achievements of the Lao Patriotic Military and People in March and calling on them to press on and achieve greater victories.

The report stated that in March, the main forces, local forces, and guerrilla units of the Lao People's Liberation Army, in close cooperation with the Patriotic Neutralist Armed Forces, with the full support and assistance of people of all ethnic groups, bravely, proactively, and continuously attacked the enemy. According to incomplete statistics, the Lao Liberation Army and Patriotic Neutralist Armed Forces engaged in over 80 battles with the enemy in March, eliminating and disbanding 1,710 enemy personnel. Of these, 938 were killed, 194 were wounded, 107 were captured, 366 surrendered, and 105 fled. Among the eliminated enemies, there were 24 American invaders. In addition, the Lao Patriotic Military and People also seized 538 various weapons, shot down and destroyed 20 American aggressor aircraft, eliminated a batch of American spies, sank 9 enemy motorboats and patrol boats, and liberated over 30,000 residents.

The report finally called on the patriotic military and people of the entire country and the Patriotic Neutralist Armed Forces to press forward, continuously strike the enemy, eliminate more of the enemy's fighting strength, shoot down more American aggressor aircraft, and achieve greater victories.

According to a report from Xinhua News Agency in KHANGKHAY on April 7, the Pathet Lao Radio Station issued a commentary on April 6, strongly condemning the heinous crime of American aggressor aircraft recently madly bombing and strafing the city of KHANGKHAY.

The commentary pointed out that the U.S. imperialists and their lackeys attempted to shake the resolve of the Lao people and make them surrender, but this is merely a fantasy. The bombing of the liberated areas by the U.S. imperialists and their lackeys not only fails to intimidate the Lao people but instead makes the Lao people more hateful and determined to defeat them.

The Lao Patriotic Military and People are fighting stronger and stronger, continually growing, and powerfully striking the American invaders and their lackeys. The image shows Lao guerrilla forces practicing their combat skills under the scorching sun. (Photo by Xinhua News Agency reporter)

    老挝爱国军民三月份战绩辉煌
    消灭和瓦解敌人一千七百，解放居民三万多
    新华社康开六日电据巴特寮通讯社报道：老挝人民解放军最高指挥部参谋部四日发表三月份战绩公报，总结了老挝爱国军民三月份所取得的辉煌战果，号召老挝爱国军民乘胜前进，夺取更大的胜利。
    公报说，三月份，老挝人民解放军主力部队、地方部队和民兵游击队同爱国中立武装力量密切配合，在各族人民的全力支持和帮助下，英勇、主动和连续地进攻敌人。据不完全的统计，老挝解放军和爱国中立武装力量三月份同敌人进行了八十多次战斗，消灭和瓦解敌人一千七百一十名，其中包括打死九百三十八名、打伤一百九十四名、俘虏一百零七名、迫降三百六十六名、逃跑的一百零五名。在被消灭的敌人中，有美国侵略军二十四名。此外，老挝爱国军民还缴获各种武器五百三十八件，击落击毁美国强盗飞机二十架，消灭美国飞贼一批，击沉敌军汽艇和机动艇九艘，解放了三万多居民。
    公报最后号召老挝全国爱国军民和爱国中立武装力量勇往直前，连续打击敌人，消灭敌人更多的有生力量，击落更多的美国强盗飞机，夺取更大的胜利。
    据新华社康开七日电巴特寮电台六日发表评论，强烈谴责美国强盗飞机最近疯狂轰炸和扫射康开市的滔天罪行。
    评论指出，美帝国主义及其走狗妄图使老挝人民动摇，向它们屈服，这只不过是幻想而已。美帝国主义及其走狗对解放区进行的轰炸，不仅吓不倒老挝人民，相反使老挝人民更加仇恨它们，更有决心战胜它们。（附图片）
