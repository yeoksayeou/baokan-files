Japanese reactionaries are intensifying their economic expansion and plunder in Thailand.

Japanese monopoly capital is rapidly exporting capital to Thailand. According to Japan's Ministry of International Trade and Industry, from 1962 to May 1967, the Japanese reactionaries provided the Thai reactionaries with "economic cooperation" funds totaling 9.6 billion yen. In 1965 and 1966, they exported approximately $80 million in so-called "long-term credit loans" to Thailand. In January of this year, the Sato government signed a new loan agreement with the Thai puppet government to provide $60 million.

The proportion of Japanese goods in Thailand's total imports has increased from 22.9% in 1958 to 30.6% in 1965, second only to the United States.

To plunder Thailand's resources, Japanese reactionaries' direct investments in Thai private enterprises are also increasing. According to statistics, by July 1966, the total foreign investment in Thailand amounted to 986.75 million baht (Thai currency), of which Japanese investments reached 411.85 million baht.

The number of Japanese companies that have entered Thailand is astonishing. There are 120 Japanese companies with offices in Bangkok. Japanese media say: these Japanese companies have already monopolized many industries. They ruthlessly exploit the Thai working people.

    日本反动派向泰国输出资本大肆掠夺
    据新华社讯　东京消息：美帝走狗日本反动派正在加紧向泰国进行经济扩张和掠夺。
    日本垄断资本加紧向泰国输出资本。据日本通商产业省公布，从一九六二年到一九六七年五月，日本反动派向泰国反动派提供的“经济合作”资金共计九十六亿日元，并在一九六五、一九六六两年，向泰国输出约达八千多万美元的所谓“长期信用贷款”。今年一月，佐藤政府又同泰国傀儡政府签订了一项向泰国提供六千万美元的新贷款协定。
    日本商品在泰国进口总额中所占的比率，也从一九五八年的百分之二十二点九增加到一九六五年的百分之三十点六，仅次于美国，占第二位。
    为了掠夺泰国的资源，日本反动派向泰国的民间直接投资也日益增加。据统计，到一九六六年七月，外国对泰国的投资总额共九亿八千六百七十五万铢（泰国货币名），其中日本的投资额达到四亿一千一百八十五万铢。
    打进泰国的日本企业已经达到惊人的数目。在曼谷有“办事处”的日本企业就有一百二十家。日本报刊说：这些日本企业，已经在许多行业中取得了垄断地位。它们残酷地剥削着泰国的劳动人民。
