Recently, our Hebei Province Qinghe County Mao Zedong Thought Broadcasting Station discussed the issue of increasing production and saving. Some comrades said, "Our unit neither manages money nor materials, so saving has no benefit!" Is there really no benefit in saving? Everyone, with this question in mind, repeatedly studied Chairman Mao's latest directive, "To further save and make revolution." Chairman Mao's words are like a bright lamp, illuminating everyone's hearts.

A machinery worker checked and said:
"I used to think that the broadcasting station neither manages money nor materials, so saving has no point. But when I compared it with Chairman Mao's directive, I found that my thinking was wrong. Is it really that we have no savings here? No. Take the purchase of a tape recorder as an example. Originally, there was a broken wooden-cased tape recorder that could be used after repair. However, at that time, I only thought about the wooden-cased machine looking bad and being inconvenient to carry, and strongly advocated buying a new one, without considering how to follow Chairman Mao's directive to 'save and make revolution.'"

Another comrade said: "In the past, I was the same as everyone else, thinking that the broadcasting station is for propaganda, and doing a good job of propaganda on saving is enough. As for how our unit saves, I never thought about it. After checking, I found the loopholes of waste. For example, I was afraid of broadcasting errors, often requiring the power plant to send electricity early and stop it late, wasting a lot of electricity in between. Electricity is the main power of industrial production, and every kilowatt-hour is hard to come by. What reason do I have to let it be wasted? Now it seems that it's not that there is nothing to save, but that I haven't established the thought of 'saving is glorious, wasting is shameful.'"

Through learning and comparison, everyone realized that as long as we highlight proletarian politics and use Mao Zedong Thought as the guide, there is much to be done in saving. Now, all the staff of the station are launching an activity to save one kilowatt-hour of electricity, one cent of money, and one piece of paper.

### 节约真的没啥“油水”吗？

    节约真的没啥“油水”吗？
    不久前，我们河北省清河县毛泽东思想广播站，在讨论增产节约问题时，一些同志说：“咱这个单位既不管钱，又不管物，节约没啥油水！”真的没啥油水吗？大家带着这个问题，反复学习了毛主席“要进一步节约闹革命”的最新指示。毛主席的话象一盏明灯，照得大家的心通亮通亮。
    一位机务员检查说：
  “我原来认为广播站不管钱，又不管物，节约没搞头。可是用毛主席的指示一对照，就发现自己的想法错了。我们这里是真的没油水吗？不是的。就拿买录音机这件事来说吧，本来有一台坏木壳录音机，修理后就能用。可是当时，我考虑的只是木壳机样子不好看，携带不方便，极力主张买新的，就没有想到怎样按照毛主席
  ‘要节约闹革命’的指示办事。”
    另一位同志说：“过去我和大家一样，认为广播站是搞宣传的，做好节约宣传就行了，至于本单位怎样搞节约，从来没想过。经过检查，就找到了浪费的漏洞。比如我怕误广播，经常要求发电厂提前送电，晚停电，中间浪费电很多。电是工业生产的主要动力，一度电来之不易，我有什么理由让它白白浪费掉呢？现在看来，不是没有可节约的，而是我头脑里没有树立‘节约光荣，浪费可耻’的思想。”
    通过学习和对照，大家认识到只要突出无产阶级政治，用毛泽东思想挂帅，节约就大有可为。现在全站职工正在开展一个节约一度电、一厘钱、一张纸的活动。
