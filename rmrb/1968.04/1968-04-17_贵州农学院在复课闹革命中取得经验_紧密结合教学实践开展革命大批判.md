Guizhou Agricultural College has gained valuable experience in resuming classes and making revolution by closely integrating revolutionary criticism with teaching practice.

Under the guidance of Chairman Mao's brilliant thoughts on educational revolution, revolutionary teachers and students have, through revolutionary criticism, further clarified the revolutionary direction of teaching. They have compiled textbooks that meet practical needs and explored teaching methods such as comparative and discussion-based approaches.

According to a report from the *New Guizhou Daily*, since resuming classes and making revolution, the broad revolutionary teachers, students, and staff of Guizhou Agricultural College have, under the guidance of Chairman Mao's brilliant thoughts on educational revolution and with the help of the military training department, adopted the method of "criticizing one lesson at a time, one issue at a time, and criticizing while changing." They have closely integrated the criticism of the revisionist educational line with teaching practice and teaching reform, gaining good experience in carrying out deep and sustained revolutionary criticism.

	Upholding the Revolutionary Direction of Serving the Poor and Lower-Middle Peasants

Chairman Mao teaches us: "The question of for whom is a fundamental question, a question of principle." For a long time, a handful of capitalist roaders within the Party have pushed the revisionist educational line in Guizhou Agricultural College, attempting to cultivate students into individuals who are detached from the masses, detached from reality, and detached from proletarian politics, becoming successors to the bourgeoisie. In teaching practice, revolutionary teachers, students, and staff have conducted a profound criticism of this revisionist line.

The revolutionary teachers and students of the Class of '68 in the Animal Husbandry and Veterinary Department, during the "intestine anastomosis surgery" class, criticized the revisionist line on the issue of school construction. They brought a handful of capitalist roaders and bourgeois academic "authorities" to the scene—the veterinary hospital—for a face-to-face criticism struggle. This veterinary hospital was built on a remote hillside far from the main road. Every time the poor and lower-middle peasants brought sick livestock for treatment, they had to exert tremendous effort to carry the animals up the hill. Sometimes, they couldn't make it in time, and the livestock would die halfway up the hill, causing significant losses. The revolutionary teachers, students, and poor and lower-middle peasants had long been indignant about this. This time, the revolutionary teachers and students, facing the veterinary hospital, angrily questioned the capitalist roaders: "Why did you build the veterinary hospital in this remote place?" "Why are the instruments and equipment in the operating room all high-tech and advanced?" "What kind of successors do you want to cultivate?" "Can what we learn serve the broad poor and lower-middle peasants? Can it serve proletarian politics?"

The poor and lower-middle peasant community members participating in the criticism also angrily questioned the capitalist roaders: "You bunch of bad guys, why did you build the veterinary hospital on this hill? Every time we bring a sick animal for treatment, we have to walk so far, and it delays the treatment of the sick animal. Who are you serving?" They went on to deeply criticize the evil nature of the revisionist educational line.

Through the criticism, the revolutionary teachers and students further clarified the revolutionary direction of teaching. Regarding how to reform the "intestine anastomosis surgery" class, they believed that first, one must have class feelings for the poor and lower-middle peasants and establish the spirit of "completely" and "thoroughly" serving the people. Therefore, before performing the surgery, the revolutionary teachers and students all seriously studied the "Three Articles," using Chairman Mao's teachings on "completely," "thoroughly," and the two "extremes" as their guiding ideology to perform the surgery. They regarded every action they took as a concrete manifestation of their responsibility to the revolution and the people. When criticizing the bourgeois educational direction, the revolutionary teachers and students also, based on the actual needs of the countryside in Guizhou, moved the operating room to the commune. Under the condition that the treatment instruments were limited, they made do with what they had, using ordinary scissors instead of surgical scissors, homemade hooks instead of imported hooks, and ordinary small knives instead of surgical knives. Because they had deep class feelings and wholeheartedly served the poor and lower-middle peasants, the surgery was very successful. The poor and lower-middle peasants excitedly said: "Only Chairman Mao's educational line and educational thoughts can cultivate true veterinarians who serve the poor and lower-middle peasants and cultivate successors to the proletarian revolutionary cause."

	Thoroughly Reforming Textbooks to Revolutionize Teaching Content

In the "Sixteen Points" personally drafted by Chairman Mao, it is pointed out: "The school system should be shortened. The curriculum should be simplified. Textbooks must be thoroughly reformed, some should be simplified first." In the process of resuming classes and making revolution, the revolutionary teachers and students of the Agricultural Department deeply felt that to simplify the curriculum and reform textbooks, one must thoroughly break away from the educational system and teaching content of the feudal, bourgeois, and revisionist classes. In the past, the textbooks of this department were directly copied from the Soviet revisionists, and the teaching aids were also large machines that did not suit the needs of Guizhou, such as tooth-type seeders, 24-type seeders, rake machines, universal cultivators, and mowing machines, etc. The state spent a large amount of money buying them, but they were never used once. Students spent a lot of time learning but didn't understand, and after graduating, they couldn't use them. Through presenting facts, the revolutionary teachers and students criticized the revisionist curriculum content, saying: These bourgeois and revisionist things are harmful and must be firmly eliminated.

After eliminating them, what should be done? The revolutionary teachers and students of the Agricultural Department, following Chairman Mao's teachings on "education serving proletarian politics and combining education with productive labor," based on the students' original level and the needs of their work after graduation, and starting from the actual situation of the countryside in Guizhou and Southwest China, changed the previously complex more than ten courses in the agricultural machinery course to three contents suitable for mountainous areas: electric motors, submersible electric pumps, and water wheel pumps. They also adopted the principle of combining workers, students, and teachers, organizing, planning, and leading them to conduct investigations and understand the situation in factories and rural areas, and finally compiled agricultural machinery course textbooks that met practical needs.

	Teaching Methods with Distinct Political Characteristics

Chairman Mao teaches us: "We must learn from the producers, learn from the workers, and learn from the poor and lower-middle peasants." The revolutionary teachers and students of the Plant Protection and Horticulture Department, following Chairman Mao's teachings, adopted comparative and discussion-based teaching methods when teaching vegetable courses, using the warm beds created by the poor and lower-middle peasants to compare with the foreign warm beds created by the capitalist roaders within the Party. In the past, the capitalist roaders within the Party pursued high, foreign, precise, and advanced things. In 1955, they spent nearly 100,000 yuan to build a beautiful vegetable garden, which took twelve years to produce only over a hundred cucumbers. They also created a concrete cabinet warm bed, characterized by large space, slow warming, poor insulation, and inconvenient operation, each costing 600-700 yuan. However, the poor and lower-middle peasants of Chaoyang Commune in Guiyang created a simple warm bed with plastic film, which is easy to warm, insulates well, is easy to operate, has a low cost (each costs only about 5 yuan), and is highly effective. The teacher, in the lecture, made a clear comparison between the two types of warm beds, further arousing the revolutionary teachers, students, and staff's intense hatred for the revisionist educational line. They immediately launched a criticism of the revisionist educational line, teaching content, and teaching methods. Everyone believed that the revisionist educational policy could only cultivate students into individuals who are detached from reality, detached from the masses, with idle hands and ignorant of the five grains, becoming successors to the bourgeoisie.

Through the warm bed comparison and classroom debate, the students believed that this teaching method not only has distinct political characteristics but is also simple, clear, easy to understand, meets the needs, and thoroughly eliminated the past bourgeois teaching content and teaching methods that were detached from the masses, detached from reality, greedy for knowledge, and comprehensive.

    贵州农学院在复课闹革命中取得经验
    紧密结合教学实践开展革命大批判
    革命师生在毛主席教育革命光辉思想照耀下，通过革命大批判进一步明确了教学的革命方向，编写出切合实际需要的教材，摸索出对比式、讨论式教学方法
    据《新贵州报》报道　贵州农学院广大革命师生员工复课闹革命以来，在毛主席教育革命光辉思想的照耀下，在军训部队的帮助下，采取“一课一批、一事一批、边批边改”的办法，把对修正主义教育路线的大批判和教学实践、教学改革紧密地结合起来，取得了深入持久地开展革命大批判的好经验。
  坚持为贫下中农服务的革命方向
    毛主席教导我们：“为什么人的问题，是一个根本的问题，原则的问题。”长期以来，党内一小撮走资派在贵州农学院推行修正主义教育路线，妄图把青年学生培养成为脱离群众、脱离实际、脱离无产阶级政治的资产阶级接班人。广大革命师生员工在教学实践中，对这一套修正主义货色进行了深刻的批判。畜牧兽医系六八级革命师生在上“肠吻合手术课”时，为了批判在建校问题上的修正主义路线，把党内一小撮走资派和资产阶级反动学术“权威”带到现场——兽医院，进行面对面的批判斗争。这个学校的兽医院修在远离公路的偏僻小山上，贫下中农每次送病畜来治疗时，都要费九牛二虎之力才能把病畜抬上小山，有时来不及，病畜就死在半山腰，造成了很大的损失。广大革命师生和贫下中农对此早就十分愤慨。这次，革命师生面对着兽医院，愤怒地质问走资派：“为什么要把兽医院修在这个偏僻的山上？”“为什么手术室的器械设备尽是高、洋、精、尖的？”“你们要把我们培养成什么样的接班人？”“我们所学的一套能为广大贫下中农服务吗？能为无产阶级政治服务吗？”参加批判的贫下中农社员也愤怒地质问走资派：“你们这一小撮坏蛋，把兽医院修在这座山上，我们抬一头病畜来医治就要走这么远，又延误对病畜的治疗，你们到底是为谁服务的？”他们接着深入地批判了修正主义教育路线的罪恶本质。
    革命师生通过大批判，进一步明确了教学的革命方向。对于如何改革“肠吻合手术课”，他们认为，首先要有贫下中农的阶级感情，要树立“完全”“彻底”为人民服务的精神。因此，在动手术前，革命师生都认真学习“老三篇”，以毛主席的“完全”“彻底”和两个“极端”的教导为指导思想，来施行手术。他们把每做一个动作都看作是对革命对人民负责的具体表现。革命师生在批判资产阶级办学方向时，还根据贵州农村的实际需要，把手术室搬到公社，在治疗器械受条件限制的情况下，因陋就简，以普通剪刀代替手术剪，用自制的创钩代替洋创钩，用普通小刀代替手术刀。因为他们怀着深厚的阶级感情全心全意为贫下中农服务，在医治病畜时，手术进行得很成功。贫下中农激动地说：“只有毛主席的教育路线、教育思想，才能培养出真正为贫下中农服务的人民兽医，才能培养出无产阶级革命事业的接班人。”
  彻底改革教材，使教学内容革命化
    毛主席亲自主持制定的十六条中指出：“学制要缩短。课程设置要精简。教材要彻底改革，有的首先删繁就简。”在复课闹革命中，农学系的革命师生深刻地体会到，要精简课程，要改革教材，必须大破封、资、修的教育制度和教学内容。这个系过去的教材是生搬硬套照抄苏修的那一套，教具也是不适合贵州地区需要的大机器，如牙型点播机、24型播种机、搂草机、万能中耕机、割草机，等等，国家花了大量的钱买来，却未用过一次。学生花了大量学时学不懂，出了学校用不上。革命师生通过摆事实，对修正主义的课程内容进行了批判，他们说：这些资产阶级、修正主义的东西害死人，必须坚决破除。
    破除以后怎么办呢？农学系的革命师生遵循毛主席“教育为无产阶级政治服务、教育与生产劳动相结合”的教导，根据学生原有程度和毕业后工作的需要，并从贵州和西南地区农村的实际情况出发，把原来农机课中繁杂的十多门课程，改为适应山区需要的电动机、潜水电泵、水轮泵三个内容。他们还采取工人、学生、教员三结合的方针，有组织、有计划、有领导地深入工厂、农村进行调查了解，最后编写出了切合实际需要的农机课教材。
    具有鲜明政治性的教学方法
    毛主席教导我们：“要向生产者学习，向工人学习，向贫农下中农学习”。植保园艺系革命师生遵照毛主席这个教导，在上蔬菜课时，采取对比式和讨论式的教学方法，用贫下中农创造的温床来与学校党内走资派所搞的洋温床作对比。过去党内走资派单纯追求高、洋、精、尖那一套，在一九五五年花了近十万元建造了一个美丽的蔬菜花园，历时十二年之久，只生产黄瓜一百多条。他们还搞了一种水泥柜温床，特点是空间大，起温慢，保温差，操作不方便，每一个价值六七百元。而贵阳地区朝阳公社贫下中农，根据多年的实践经验，创造了一种结构简单、起温快、保温好、操作简便、成本低（每个只需五元左右）、功效高的塑料薄膜保温的简单温床。教师在讲课中将这两种温床作了鲜明的对比，更加激起了革命师生员工对修正主义教育路线的无比愤恨，当场就展开了对修正主义教育路线、教学内容、教学方法的批判。大家认为，修正主义的教育方针只能把学生培养成为脱离实际、脱离群众、四肢不勤、五谷不分的资产阶级接班人。
    通过温床对比和课堂辩论，学生们认为这样教学不但有鲜明的政治性，而且简单明了、通俗易懂、切合需要，彻底破除了过去那种脱离群众、脱离实际、贪多求全、面面俱到的资产阶级教学内容和教学方法。
