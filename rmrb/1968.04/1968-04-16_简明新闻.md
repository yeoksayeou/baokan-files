    The U.S. Rushes to Dump Surplus Agricultural Products on Japan, Shifting Crisis
    U.S. imperialism is hastening to dump surplus agricultural products on Japan, shifting the dollar crisis onto Japan, and severely disrupting Japan's agriculture.

    Recently, U.S. Secretary of Agriculture Freeman went to Tokyo to pressure Japan. Freeman said: "Japanese (monopoly capital) benefited from the Vietnam War and should buy more American agricultural products to help defend the dollar."

    Last year, the total value of agricultural products exported by the U.S. to Japan reached $790 million, an increase of 250 percent compared to 1960.

    Britain's Trade Deficit Soars to Over £100 Million
    Despite various "rescue" measures taken by the British Labour government to improve the balance of payments and stabilize the pound after its devaluation, Britain's trade deficit continues to rise like a kite with a broken string.

    According to reports, Britain's trade deficit in March reached £103 million, compared to £35 million in January.

    This figure is also the highest since the pound's devaluation in November last year.

    Japan Aggressively Enters British Market, Displacing British Goods
    As the financial crisis deepens in the capitalist world, capitalist countries are frantically competing to capture export markets to shift the crisis. Recently, according to the Associated Press, Japanese cars have entered the British market, with 4,000 to 5,000 Japanese small cars set to be imported into Britain for the first time, "intense competition in the British small car market is imminent."

    In Malawi, Africa, Japanese motorcycles and textiles are also rapidly displacing British goods. Japanese products have already captured 19 percent of the market, while Britain's share is declining.

    去年，美国向日本出口的农产品总额达七亿九千多万美元，比一九六○年增加了百分之二百五十。

    据报道，三月份英国国际收支逆差达到一亿零三百万英镑，而一月份是三千五百万英镑。
