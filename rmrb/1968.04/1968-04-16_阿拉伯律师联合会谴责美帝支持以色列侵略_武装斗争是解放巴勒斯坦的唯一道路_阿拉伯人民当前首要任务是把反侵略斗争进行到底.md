The Arab Lawyers Union recently issued a statement in Cairo strongly condemning U.S. imperialism for supporting Israel's aggression against Arab countries. The statement asserted that armed struggle is the only path to eliminate the consequences of Israeli aggression and liberate Palestine. The Arab people's primary task at present is to carry the anti-aggression struggle to the end.

The statement said that U.S. imperialism not only fully supports its tool, Israel, in repeatedly launching aggression against Arab countries, but also uses every means to exploit Israel's aggression to suppress the Palestinian liberation struggle, attempting to force the Arab nation to surrender.

The statement strongly condemned U.S. imperialism for manipulating the United Nations to protect Israel and playing the so-called "peaceful resolution" trick. The statement pointed out that the United Nations, based on conditions proposed by Israel, demands that the Arab people surrender unconditionally and, according to the will of the United States, recognize Israel. This exposes it as a tool of U.S.-led world imperialism.

The statement pointed out that eliminating the consequences of aggression and liberating Palestine cannot rely on so-called political solutions but can only be achieved through armed struggle by the Arab people on Arab land. Carrying the liberation war to the end is the primary task of Arab countries and peoples at present.

The statement warmly applauded the Palestinian guerrillas' struggle against Israeli aggressors and for national liberation in occupied areas, reaffirming full support for the heroic resistance movement of the Palestinian Arab people.

The statement called on Arab countries to seriously and sincerely take the initiative to mobilize all their military, economic, and other forces to serve the war against imperialist and Zionist aggression.

The statement was unanimously adopted at a recent meeting of the Arab Lawyers Union's Standing Committee held here.

According to Xinhua News Agency, the Egyptian newspaper *Al-Ahram* recently published an editorial stating that Israel's aggressive actions against Arab countries cannot stop or eliminate the resistance movement of the Arab people in the occupied areas. On the contrary, the resistance movement will be more widely carried out.

The Egyptian newspaper *Al-Akhbar* recently published an editorial pointing out that it is impossible for Israel to stop the resistance movement. Where there is occupation, there is resistance. The resistance movement of the Arab people will not stop. The editorial said that U.S. imperialism has always shielded Israel, and now the United States itself is facing a more difficult situation.

    新华社开罗十二日电　阿拉伯律师联合会最近在这里发表声明，强烈谴责美帝国主义支持以色列侵略阿拉伯国家。声明指出，武装斗争是消除以色列侵略后果和解放巴勒斯坦的唯一道路。阿拉伯人民当前首要的任务是把反侵略斗争进行到底。
    声明说，美帝国主义不但完全支持它的工具以色列一再发动对阿拉伯国家的侵略，而且用一切办法利用以色列的侵略来镇压巴勒斯坦的解放斗争，企图逼迫阿拉伯民族投降。
    声明强烈谴责美帝国主义操纵联合国保护以色列，玩弄所谓“和平解决”的鬼把戏。声明指出，联合国企图根据以色列提出的条件，要阿拉伯人民无条件投降，并按照美国的意旨，要阿拉伯人民承认以色列，这就暴露了它是以美国为首的世界帝国主义的工具。
    声明指出，消灭侵略后果和解放巴勒斯坦，绝不能依靠所谓政治解决，而只能在阿拉伯土地上，由阿拉伯人民进行武装斗争。把解放战争进行到底，这是当前阿拉伯国家和人民的首要任务。
    声明热烈欢呼巴勒斯坦游击战士在被占领地区进行的反对以色列侵略者、争取民族解放的斗争，重申完全支持巴勒斯坦阿拉伯人民的英勇的抵抗运动。
    声明呼吁阿拉伯各国严肃地、真诚地采取主动措施，动员它们的一切军事、经济及其他力量，为反对帝国主义和犹太复国主义侵略的战争服务。
    声明是在最近在这里举行的阿拉伯律师联合会常设局会议上一致通过的。
    据新华社讯　阿联报纸《金字塔报》不久前发表社论说，以色列对阿拉伯国家采取侵略行动，绝不能够制止和消灭被占领区内的阿拉伯人民的抵抗运动，恰恰相反，抵抗运动将会更加广泛地开展起来。
    阿联《消息报》不久前发表的社论指出，以色列要想制止抵抗运动是不可能的。哪里有侵占，哪里就有反抗。阿拉伯人民的抵抗运动决不会中止。社论说，美帝国主义一贯庇护以色列，现在美国自己也已面临着更困难的处境。
