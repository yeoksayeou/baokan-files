The Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region's conference of advanced collectives and activists in studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought was successfully held. In the midst of a favorable situation, we must never forget class struggle.

The representatives believe that forgetting class struggle is equivalent to forgetting the fundamental principles of Mao Zedong Thought, and it is as if we have no soul. They launched a major exposure, criticism, and struggle against the counter-revolutionary revisionist and nationalist splittist clique in Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, led by the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents.

Xinhua News Agency, Hohhot, April 5th: The Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region's conference of advanced collectives and activists in studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought was recently successfully held in Hohhot. The representatives attending the conference expressed their determination to hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, to further study and apply Mao Zedong Thought extensively, to closely follow the great strategic deployment of Chairman Mao, to carry the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat to the end, and to build the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region into a great school of Mao Zedong Thought.

This conference was held after the establishment of the Revolutionary Committee of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region. It was convened on the basis of various levels of conferences of activists in studying Chairman Mao's works held from the grassroots up in various leagues, cities, banners, and counties across the autonomous region, summarizing the rich experiences of the broad masses in studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought. This conference was attended by more than 1,400 representatives from various ethnic groups, including Mongols and Hans, from the grasslands, forests, mountains, and urban and rural areas across the region. With profound proletarian feelings of boundless love, faith, admiration, and loyalty towards the great leader Chairman Mao, they paid tribute to Chairman Mao at this grand meeting. It was a grand meeting to sing praises to the great leader Chairman Mao, the great Mao Zedong Thought, and the proletarian revolutionary line of Chairman Mao. It was a mobilization meeting to closely follow the great strategic deployment of Chairman Mao, to grasp class struggle firmly, and to achieve a comprehensive victory in the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat. It was a rallying meeting to determine to push the great mass movement of studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought to a new stage.

At present, the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat in Inner Mongolia is in a favorable situation. Revolutionary committees have been established in all seven leagues and two cities in the region, and a new high tide of combining revolution with production is rapidly forming. People of all ethnic groups have never been as spirited, enthusiastic, and full of vigor as they are today. When the representatives discussed the current favorable situation, they enthusiastically cheered, "This is a great victory for Mao Zedong Thought! This is a great victory for the proletarian revolutionary line of Chairman Mao!"

The representatives attending the conference carefully summarized the basic experiences of studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought. They said, "There are countless experiences, but the most fundamental and core one is to have a 'loyal' heart towards the great teacher of the proletariat, Chairman Mao, and to grasp the 'application' of the invincible Mao Zedong Thought firmly." The representatives believed that to be loyal to Chairman Mao without reservation, one must grasp class education firmly and carry out extensive "bitter-sweet remembrance" activities. "Only by knowing the past bitterness can one understand today's sweetness." To be loyal to Chairman Mao without reservation, one must break down the bourgeois "self" thoroughly and establish the proletarian "public" thoroughly. The more one fights against selfishness, the closer one follows Chairman Mao; the deeper one fights against selfishness, the more intimate one is with Chairman Mao.

Emphasizing "application" means to insist on the revolutionary academic style advocated by Chairman Mao. The representatives believed that whether one studies and applies Mao Zedong Thought or not, and whether one applies it genuinely or not, is the main criterion to examine one's loyalty to the great leader Chairman Mao. Emphasizing "application" means to follow Chairman Mao's instructions step by step and never deviate. To apply firmly and follow closely, one must have high revolutionary enthusiasm and vigor. Towards Chairman Mao's instructions, one must act immediately, seize every minute, and achieve quick transmission, quick study, quick implementation, and quick results. To apply firmly and follow closely, one must constantly analyze the ever-changing revolutionary situation, maintain a clear political mind, and maintain a firm and correct political direction. One must have a strong proletarian party spirit, firmly believe in and execute every instruction of Chairman Mao without doubt, execute those that are not fully understood temporarily, and deepen understanding in the process of execution. To apply firmly and follow closely, one must firmly oppose bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism and anarchism. Experience has proven that where bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism is overthrown and anarchism is overcome, there one can closely follow the great strategic deployment of Chairman Mao.

To study and apply Mao Zedong Thought, one must carry out extensive mass movements. One must study everywhere, in every aspect, and make Mao Zedong Thought arm every person's mind, occupying every position. The representatives said: The main experience of carrying out extensive mass movements is to vigorously establish various types of Mao Zedong Thought study classes. Through this method, one can mobilize the masses most extensively, organize the masses most effectively, educate the masses most universally, and fully mobilize the revolutionary enthusiasm of the masses, making everyone concerned about national affairs and everyone engage in self-criticism and criticism of revisionism. Grasping typical examples and promoting them widely is also an effective way to carry out the mass movement of studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought extensively. Since the establishment of the Revolutionary Committee of the autonomous region, the advanced experiences of the Hangjin Hou Banner and Ningcheng County in following the great strategic deployment of Chairman Mao step by step and fully implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions have been vigorously promoted, playing a significant role in the entire region. Organizing Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams to go deep into factories, rural areas, and pastoral areas to propagate and implement Chairman Mao's series of latest instructions is also an effective way to promote the mass movement of studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought to develop deeply. Many advanced collectives in the autonomous region have used this method and achieved remarkable results.

At this conference, all the representatives, through extensive study, exchange, and summary, further raised their awareness of class struggle and line struggle, elevating their understanding of loyalty to the great leader Chairman Mao, loyalty to Mao Zedong Thought, and loyalty to the proletarian revolutionary line of Chairman Mao to a new height.

The representatives deeply realized from their revolutionary struggle practice that: "In this historical stage of socialism, there still exist classes, class contradictions, and class struggle, there still exist the struggle between the socialist and capitalist roads, and there still exists the danger of capitalist restoration." Therefore, one must never forget class struggle, never forget the dictatorship of the proletariat, never forget to emphasize proletarian politics, and never forget to hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought. The representatives said, forgetting class struggle is equivalent to forgetting the fundamental principles of Mao Zedong Thought, and it is as if we have no soul. The closer the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat is to a comprehensive victory, the sharper and more complex the class struggle becomes. In the current favorable situation, one must never forget class struggle. One must fully exert the mighty power of the dictatorship of the proletariat, strengthen military-civilian unity, maintain high revolutionary vigilance, unite to expose spies, traitors, diehard capitalist-roaders, and all open or hidden class enemies. During the conference, the representatives, with boundless love for the great leader Chairman Mao and deep hatred for the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents, launched a major exposure, criticism, and struggle against the counter-revolutionary revisionist and nationalist splittist clique in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region.

This conference issued a call to the people of all ethnic groups in the region, urging them to take Vice Chairman Lin Biao as a shining example, to make studying, propagating, executing, and defending Mao Zedong Thought their lifelong mission. They must resolutely respond to Chairman Mao's great call, to establish and run various types of Mao Zedong Thought study classes extensively. The call urged the people of all ethnic groups to carry forward the revolutionary academic style advocated by Chairman Mao, to study Mao Zedong Thought, and to focus on the "application." One must remember Chairman Mao's great teaching of "never forgetting class struggle," to launch a new high tide of revolutionary criticism, to criticize the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents in Inner Mongolia deeply and thoroughly, to criticize and expose their poison thoroughly, to overthrow and smear them thoroughly, to overcome bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism, to further develop and consolidate the great alliance of revolution and the three-in-one combination, to do a good job in the struggle, criticism, and reform in various departments and units, to rectify the party organization, and to strengthen party building. All ethnic groups in the region must resolutely respond to Chairman Mao's great call of "grasp revolution, promote production, work, and preparedness," to strengthen socialist labor discipline, to overcome anarchism, to "save money for the revolution," to resolutely resist the counter-revolutionary economic wind, to quickly launch a new high tide of production, and to achieve greater harvests in agriculture, animal husbandry, and industry this year.

At the conference, all the representatives, with profound proletarian feelings, passed a resolution of tribute to the great leader Chairman Mao and a resolution of determination to Vice Chairman Lin Biao in the midst of thunderous applause.

The Chairman of the Revolutionary Committee of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, Teng Haicheng, and the Vice Chairman, Gao Jinming, made reports and speeches at the conference.

    内蒙古自治区活学活用毛泽东思想先进集体和积极分子代表会议胜利举行
    在大好形势下千万不要忘记阶级斗争
    代表们认为，忘记了阶级斗争，就是忘记了毛泽东思想的根本观点，就等于没有灵魂。他们对中国赫鲁晓夫及其代理人内蒙古自治区的反革命修正主义、民族分裂主义集团进行了大揭露、大批判、大斗争
    新华社呼和浩特五日电　内蒙古自治区活学活用毛泽东思想先进集体和积极分子代表会议，最近在呼和浩特市胜利举行。参加会议的代表表示，决心高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，进一步大学大用毛泽东思想，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底，把内蒙古自治区建设成为红彤彤的毛泽东思想大学校。
    这次会议，是在内蒙古自治区革命委员会成立以后，自治区各盟、市、旗、县自下而上地召开了各级学习毛主席著作积极分子代表大会，总结了广大群众活学活用毛泽东思想的丰富经验的基础上召开的。这次会议，是来自草原、林海、山区和广大城乡的一千四百多名蒙、汉等民族代表，怀着对伟大领袖毛主席无限热爱、无限信仰、无限崇拜、无限忠诚的深厚的无产阶级感情，向伟大领袖毛主席敬献忠心的大会，是大颂特颂伟大领袖毛主席、伟大的毛泽东思想和毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的大会，是紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，狠抓阶级斗争，夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的动员大会，是决心把活学活用毛泽东思想的伟大群众运动推向新阶段的誓师大会。
    当前，内蒙古的无产阶级文化大革命形势大好。全区七盟二市都成立了革命委员会，抓革命促生产的新高潮正在迅速形成。各族革命人民从来没有象今天这样精神振奋，斗志昂扬，意气风发。代表们在畅谈当前大好形势时热烈欢呼，这是毛泽东思想的伟大胜利，这是毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的伟大胜利！
    参加会议的代表认真总结了活学活用毛泽东思想的基本经验。他们说，经验有千万条，最根本、最核心的，就是对无产阶级伟大导师毛主席心怀一个“忠”字，对战无不胜的毛泽东思想狠抓一个“用”字。代表们认为，要做到无限忠于毛主席，就要狠抓阶级教育，广泛开展忆苦思甜活动，“只有知道过去苦，才能懂得今日甜”。要做到无限忠于毛主席，必须大破资产阶级的“私”字，大立无产阶级的“公”字。斗私越狠，跟毛主席越紧；斗私越深，对毛主席越亲。
    突出“用”字，就是要坚持毛主席倡导的革命学风。代表们认为，对毛泽东思想，学了用还是不用，真用还是假用，是检验我们对伟大领袖毛主席忠不忠的主要标志。突出“用”字，就要做到对毛主席的指示步步紧跟，寸步不离。要用得狠、跟得紧，就要有高度的革命热情和革命干劲。对毛主席的指示，要闻风而动，争分夺秒，做到传达快，学习快，贯彻快，见效快。要用得狠、跟得紧，就要经常分析不断发展变化的革命形势，保持清醒的政治头脑，保持坚定正确的政治方向。要有坚强的无产阶级党性，对毛主席的每项指示都坚信不疑，理解的坚决执行，暂时不完全理解的也要坚决执行，在执行中加深理解。要用得狠、跟得紧，就要坚决反对资产阶级、小资产阶级派性和无政府主义。经验证明：那里打倒了资产阶级、小资产阶级派性，克服了无政府主义，那里就能紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署。
    活学活用毛泽东思想，必须大搞群众运动。要做到人人学，处处学，事事学，使毛泽东思想武装每个人的头脑，让毛泽东思想占领一切阵地。代表们说：大搞群众运动的主要经验是，大力开办各种类型的毛泽东思想学习班。通过这个办法，可以最广泛地发动群众，最有效地组织群众，最普遍地教育群众，最集中地发挥群众的革命积极性，使人人关心国家大事，人人斗私批修。狠抓典型，以点带面，也是大力开展活学活用毛泽东思想群众运动的好办法。自治区革命委员会成立以来，大力推广杭锦后旗和宁城县步步紧跟毛主席伟大战略部署，全面落实毛主席最新指示的先进经验，对全区起了很大推动作用。组织毛泽东思想宣传队，深入工厂、农村、牧区宣传、落实毛主席的一系列最新指示，也是推动活学活用毛泽东思想群众运动深入发展的有效形式。自治区不少先进集体运用这个方法，取得了显著成效。
    在这次会议上，全体代表通过大学习、大交流、大总结，进一步提高了阶级斗争和路线斗争觉悟，把对忠于伟大领袖毛主席、忠于毛泽东思想、忠于毛主席无产阶级革命路线的认识，提高到了一个新的高度。
    代表们从自己革命斗争的实践中深刻地认识到：“在社会主义这个历史阶段中，还存在着阶级、阶级矛盾和阶级斗争，存在着社会主义同资本主义两条道路的斗争，存在着资本主义复辟的危险性。”因此，必须念念不忘阶级斗争，念念不忘无产阶级专政，念念不忘突出无产阶级政治，念念不忘高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗。代表们说，忘记了阶级斗争，就是忘记了毛泽东思想的根本观点，就等于没有灵魂。无产阶级文化大革命越接近全面胜利，阶级斗争就越尖锐、复杂。在当前大好形势下，千万不要忘记阶级斗争。一定要发挥无产阶级专政的强大威力，大力加强军民团结，保持高度革命警惕，共同对敌，彻底揭露特务、叛徒、顽固不化的走资派和一切公开或隐蔽的阶级敌人。在大会期间，代表们怀着对伟大领袖毛主席无限热爱，对中国赫鲁晓夫及其代理人无比仇恨的心情，对内蒙古自治区的反革命修正主义、民族分裂主义集团，进行了大揭露、大批判、大斗争。
    这次会议向全区各族人民发出了倡议，号召各族人民以林彪副主席为光辉榜样，把学习、宣传、执行、捍卫毛泽东思想，作为自己的毕生事业。坚决响应毛主席的伟大号召，大办、办好各种类型的毛泽东思想学习班。倡议号召各族人民发扬毛主席倡导的革命学风，学习毛泽东思想，在“用”字上狠下功夫。要牢记毛主席“千万不要忘记阶级斗争”的伟大教导，掀起一个革命大批判的新高潮，把中国赫鲁晓夫及其在内蒙古的代理人，批深批透，批倒批臭，彻底肃清他们的流毒。打倒资产阶级、小资产阶级派性，进一步发展和巩固革命的大联合和革命的三结合，搞好各部门、各单位的斗批改。整顿党的组织，加强党的建设。全区各族人民要坚决响应毛主席“抓革命，促生产，促工作，促战备”的伟大号召，加强社会主义劳动纪律，克服无政府主义，“要进一步节约闹革命”，坚决抵制反革命经济主义歪风，迅速掀起生产新高潮，夺取今年工农牧业生产的更大丰收。
    会上，全体代表怀着深厚的无产阶级感情，在暴风雨般的热烈掌声中，通过了给伟大领袖毛主席的致敬电和致林彪副主席的决心书。
    内蒙古自治区革命委员会主任滕海清，副主任高锦明，在会上分别作了报告和讲话。
