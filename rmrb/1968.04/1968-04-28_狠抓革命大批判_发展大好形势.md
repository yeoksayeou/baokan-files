Chairman Mao teaches us: "Make trouble, fail, make more trouble, fail again, until they are destroyed—this is the logic of imperialism and all reactionaries in the world when dealing with the people's cause. They will never deviate from this logic. This is a Marxist law."

Chairman Mao's profound judgment is a fundamental viewpoint for us to understand the nature of all reactionary classes. A handful of traitors, spies, and unrepentant capitalist-roaders who have infiltrated our party, and counter-revolutionaries who have sneaked into our revolutionary ranks, are of the same ilk as imperialism and the Kuomintang reactionaries. Some of them have already surrendered to imperialism and the Kuomintang reactionaries, while others are the dregs of the Kuomintang reactionaries. We must not think that once they are exposed, everything is settled. No, it is not. Their class nature determines that they will fight to the death against the revolutionary people. It is just that their counter-revolutionary strategies and tactics become more cunning and more treacherous as the situation changes. Toward these enemies, if you do not attack them, they will attack you; if you do not defeat them, they will defeat you; if you do not thoroughly crush them, they will rise up again. If we do not recognize this and instead harbor naive illusions, showing the slightest pity for these venomous villains, we will commit the error of rightist conservatism. Every revolutionary comrade must be seriously alert to this.

Every revolutionary comrade should, with boundless loyalty to the great leader Chairman Mao, with deep class hatred for Chinese Khrushchev and his agents, and with a high sense of political responsibility to ensure the socialist motherland remains unchanging, follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, and join the battle of revolutionary criticism. We must combine the criticism of the biggest handful of capitalist-roaders within the party with the criticism of capitalist-roaders in our own units, and combine it with the actual class struggle and line struggle in our own regions and units, and combine it with the struggle, criticism, and reform in our own units. All localities and units should strengthen the leadership of revolutionary criticism. All levels of revolutionary committees should intensify the class struggle and the struggle between the two lines, intensify revolutionary criticism, and actively and unceasingly launch attacks on the class enemies. We must dig out all the hidden traitors, spies, and all counter-revolutionaries, smash the class enemies' plots of restoration, develop the favorable situation, and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end.

### 狠抓革命大批判　发展大好形势

    狠抓革命大批判　发展大好形势
    毛主席教导我们：“捣乱，失败，再捣乱，再失败，直至灭亡——这就是帝国主义和世界上一切反动派对待人民事业的逻辑，他们决不会违背这个逻辑的。这是一条马克思主义的定律。”
    毛主席的这一英明论断是我们认识一切反动派阶级本性的一个根本观点。一小撮混进我们党里的叛徒、特务、顽固不化的走资派，钻进我们革命队伍里面的反革命分子，他们和帝国主义、国民党反动派是一路货色，他们有的早就投靠帝国主义和国民党反动派了，有的就是国民党反动派的残渣余孽。我们决不能认为，他们已被揪出来了，就“万事大吉”了。决不是的。他们的阶级本性决定了他们一定要和革命人民作拚死的斗争，只不过他们的反革命的策略和手法，随着形势的变化而变得更加狡猾、更加阴险罢了。对于这一伙敌人，你不攻他，他就攻你；你不吃掉他，他就吃掉你；你不把他彻底打倒，他就要爬起来反扑。如果我们不是这样地认识问题，而存有幼稚的幻想，对毒蛇一样的恶人有丝毫的怜惜之情，就犯了右倾保守的错误。每个革命同志必须对此引起严重警惕。
    每个革命同志，应该以对伟大领袖毛主席的无限忠诚，以对中国赫鲁晓夫及其代理人的刻骨的阶级仇恨，以对社会主义祖国永不变色的高度政治责任感，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，投入革命大批判的战斗中，要把对党内最大的一小撮走资派的批判和对本单位走资派的批判结合起来，和本地区、本单位的阶级斗争和路线斗争的实际结合起来，和本单位的斗、批、改结合起来。各地方、各单位都应该加强对革命大批判的领导。各级革命委员会应该狠抓阶级斗争和两条路线斗争，狠抓革命大批判，主动地、不停顿地向阶级敌人展开进攻。要把隐蔽的叛徒、特务和一切反革命分子统统挖出来，粉碎阶级敌人的复辟阴谋，发展大好形势，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。
