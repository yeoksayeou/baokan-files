The revolutionary workers on Anhui's transportation front have been actively organizing Mao Zedong Thought study classes. Through self-criticism and the struggle against revisionism, they have promoted a revolution in people's thinking, creating a great situation of seizing the revolution and promoting production. The volume of freight transported by trains and ships has significantly increased. In February, the volume of goods loaded at the Bengbu Railway Station increased by 48.4% compared to January, and the volume of goods unloaded more than doubled. The turnover time for vehicles was reduced by more than half. The average volume of freight transported by local transportation departments in the province in January and February increased by about 15% compared to December last year.
