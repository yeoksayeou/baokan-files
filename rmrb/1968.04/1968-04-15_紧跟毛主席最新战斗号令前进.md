In the midst of the nationwide struggle of hundreds of millions of military personnel and civilians to achieve a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, Chairman Mao has issued a highly important new directive:

The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is, in essence, a political revolution under socialist conditions, where the proletariat opposes the bourgeoisie and all exploiting classes. It is a continuation of the long-term struggle between the Chinese Communist Party and the revolutionary masses it leads, and the Kuomintang reactionaries. It is a continuation of the class struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie.

Chairman Mao's brilliant directive deeply points out the essence and great significance of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, revealing its class content and historical roots. It provides revolutionary people with a new and immensely powerful ideological weapon. It elevates our understanding of the struggle between the two classes, two roads, and two lines under socialist conditions to a new height.

Chairman Mao's brilliant directive points out the glorious and arduous combat mission of achieving a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. It serves as our battle program and action guide for seizing a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. It is our most sharp weapon for defeating a handful of class enemies. Once Chairman Mao's latest directive is grasped by the broad revolutionary masses, it will undoubtedly become a powerful material force, pushing the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to a new stage of deeper development. It will greatly accelerate the process of achieving a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. This is Chairman Mao's greatest education, greatest encouragement, and greatest exhortation to us!

Pre-liberation Tianjin was under the rule of imperialism for over a hundred years and the Kuomintang reactionaries for several decades. The roots of imperialism and the Kuomintang reactionaries run deep in Tianjin. After liberation, the Chinese Khrushchev has been tightly holding onto Tianjin, attempting to turn it into a black stronghold for restoring capitalism. The Chinese Khrushchev and the handful of capitalist roaders within the party, along with their agents in Tianjin, have always stood on the bourgeoisie's side, opposing Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, resisting the socialist revolution, shielding and indulging the bourgeoisie and all exploiting classes, colluding with imperialism and the remnants of the Kuomintang reactionaries, and frantically engaging in conspiracies to overthrow proletarian dictatorship and restore capitalism. The large number of facts exposed by our city's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution fully demonstrate that they represent the interests of the Kuomintang reactionaries, that is, the bourgeoisie and the landlords, rich farmers, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, rightists, and the remnants of the Kuomintang reactionaries. They are the agents of the Kuomintang reactionaries within our party.

We are determined to arm ourselves with Chairman Mao's latest directive, using it as our guide, to mobilize the masses and launch a thorough criticism of the reactionary bourgeois ideology. We will completely expose and criticize the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents in Tianjin, along with the counter-revolutionary revisionist line they promote. We will expose and criticize the reactionary bourgeois ideology they advocate. We will thoroughly investigate and expose the unrepentant capitalist-roaders, traitors, spies, new counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and the untransformed landlords, rich farmers, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, rightists, and Kuomintang reactionary remnants. We will thoroughly shatter their dream of restoring capitalism!

    紧跟毛主席最新战斗号令前进
    在全国亿万军民夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的大进军中，毛主席向我们发出了极为重要的最新指示：
    无产阶级文化大革命，实质上是在社会主义条件下，无产阶级反对资产阶级和一切剥削阶级的政治大革命，是中国共产党及其领导下的广大革命人民群众和国民党反动派长期斗争的继续，是无产阶级和资产阶级阶级斗争的继续。
    毛主席这一光辉指示，深刻地指出了无产阶级文化大革命的实质和伟大意义，揭示了无产阶级文化大革命的阶级内容和历史根源，给革命人民增加了新的无比强大的思想武器。把我们对社会主义条件下两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线斗争的认识提到了一个新的高度。
    毛主席这一光辉指示，为我们指明了夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的光荣而艰巨的战斗任务。它是我们夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的战斗纲领、行动指南，是我们战胜一小撮阶级敌人的最锐利的武器。毛主席最新指示为广大革命群众所掌握，必将变成强大的物质力量，把无产阶级文化大革命推向更加深入发展的新阶段，必将极大地加速夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的进程。这是毛主席对我们的最大教育，最大鼓舞，最大鞭策！
    解放前的天津，曾受帝国主义长达百年的统治，受国民党反动派几十年的统治，帝国主义和国民党反动派的毒根在天津扎得很深很深。解放后，中国赫鲁晓夫一直死死抓住天津不放，妄图把天津变成复辟资本主义的黑据点。中国赫鲁晓夫等党内最大的一小撮走资派及其在天津的代理人一直站在资产阶级立场上，对抗毛主席的革命路线，反对社会主义革命，纵容包庇资产阶级和一切剥削阶级，勾结帝国主义、国民党反动派残余势力，疯狂地进行颠覆无产阶级专政、复辟资本主义的阴谋活动。我市无产阶级文化大革命揭发出来的大量事实充分说明，他们代表了国民党反动派即资产阶级和地、富、反、坏、右的利益，他们就是国民党反动派在我们党内的代理人。
    我们决心用毛主席最新指示武装我们的头脑，以毛主席最新指示为指针，放手发动群众，深入开展革命的大批判，把中国赫鲁晓夫及其在天津的代理人和他们所推行的反革命修正主义路线，批倒批臭，把这一小撮阶级敌人所鼓动的资产阶级反动思潮批倒批臭，把死不悔改的走资派、叛徒、特务、新生的反革命分子、坏分子和没有改造好的地、富、反、坏、右、国民党反动派的余孽，统统清查出来，彻底粉碎他们资本主义复辟的梦想！
