After Xiao Liu became the head of the Revolutionary Committee, his thoughts gradually changed. He started to pay more attention to his living conditions and moved from a collective dormitory to a single room, distancing himself from the masses. With the help of the PLA comrades, Xiao Liu recognized his mistakes and thus:

He Lives with the Workers Again

Liu Xiangli, the chairman of the Revolutionary Committee of the Carpet Factory, changed after gaining power. He participated less in labor and started to pay more attention to his living conditions. Originally, he lived with the workers, but later he moved from the collective dormitory to a single room just a wall away. Liu Xiangli's changes caught the attention of the PLA's support team member, Old Wang.

Originally, Liu Xiangli was a vigorous and daring young worker. At the beginning of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, he actively responded to Chairman Mao's call to criticize the handful of capitalist roaders within the Party. He was a daring revolutionary fighter. In production, he also performed well. He ate, lived, and worked with the workers, and his relationship with them was very close. The workers affectionately called him "Xiao Liu." However, after the establishment of the Revolutionary Committee, many workers who originally worked with him started calling him "Director Liu." Why did such a big change occur?

One night, Old Wang studied Chairman Mao's latest instructions with Xiao Liu, guiding him to recall the bitter history of the old society. In the evil old society, Xiao Liu's father, Old Liu, worked to death for the capitalist. His mother, to support the family, took over her husband's work while pregnant. She worked tirelessly for more than ten hours a day, and before the month was over, she gave birth to him. To support her sister and brother, his mother, with tears in her eyes, wanted to abandon him. It was only through the persuasion of his sisters that he was kept. Thinking of this bitter family history, Xiao Liu shed tears of sorrow.

Next, Old Wang studied Chairman Mao's teachings with him: "To seize victory nationwide is only the first step in a long march of ten thousand li. The Chinese revolution is great, but the road after the revolution is longer, and the work is greater and more arduous. We must ensure that comrades continue to maintain the spirit of hard struggle." Xiao Liu read Chairman Mao's teachings word by word and said with shame, "Old Wang, I did not act according to Chairman Mao's instructions. I have let down the broad masses of workers and revolutionary cadres of the proletariat. In the past, I mistakenly thought that after gaining power and becoming an official, I had to have the appearance of an official and could no longer mix with the workers. Therefore, I moved from the workers' dormitory to a single room, isolating myself from the workers. Now I deeply feel that the single room and the workers' dormitory are only separated by a wall, but it shows that my thoughts have already distanced me from the workers, and there is a wall between me and the workers in terms of feelings."

With Old Wang's patient help, Xiao Liu's consciousness was raised. He decided to remember Chairman Mao's teachings, never forget class struggle, and always hold power for the revolution and the people. On this very night, Xiao Liu moved his bedding back and lived with the workers again.

The workers saw Liu Xiangli's transformation and were very happy. Xiao Liu's relationship with the workers became close again.

### 他又和工人住在一起了

    小刘担任革委会主任以后，思想逐渐发生了变化，住的地方也讲究了，从集体宿舍搬进了单人房间，和群众有了距离。在解放军同志的帮助下，小刘认识了自己的错误，于是：
    他又和工人住在一起了
    美术地毯厂革命委员会主任委员刘向利，掌权以后，思想逐渐发生了变化：参加劳动的时间少了，住的地方也讲究起来了。他原来和工人们住在一起，后来他从集体宿舍搬到仅隔一堵墙的单人房间去住。刘向利的变化，引起了解放军支左人员老王的注意。
    刘向利原来是一个朝气勃勃、敢想敢干的青年工人。在无产阶级文化大革命初期，他积极响应毛主席的伟大号召，大造党内一小撮走资派的反，是敢打敢冲的革命闯将；在生产中，他也表现很好。他和工人同吃同住同劳动，关系很密切，工人都热情地叫他“小刘”。可是，自从成立革委会以后，许多原来和他在一起工作的工人就称他“刘主任”了。为什么会起这样大的变化呢？
    一天夜里，老王同小刘在一起学习毛主席的最新指示，引导他回忆旧社会的苦难家史。在万恶的旧社会，小刘的父亲刘老庄给资本家拚死拚活地卖命，活活地累死了。母亲为了养活全家，带着身孕接替了父亲的工作。一天累死累活地干十几个小时，就这样不到月头，就生下了他。母亲为了养活姐姐和哥哥，含着眼泪要把他扔掉。在姐妹们的劝阻下，才把他留了下来……。想起了苦难的家史，小刘流下了悲痛的眼泪。
    接着，老王又同他一起学习了毛主席的教导：“夺取全国胜利，这只是万里长征走完了第一步。……中国的革命是伟大的，但革命以后的路程更长，工作更伟大，更艰苦。……务必使同志们继续地保持艰苦奋斗的作风。”小刘一字一句地读着毛主席的教导，很惭愧地说：“老王，我没有按毛主席的指示办事，辜负了广大工人和无产阶级革命派的期望。过去我错误地认为，掌了权，当了干部，就要有个当干部的样子，再不能同工人们混在一起了。因此我从工人宿舍搬进单人房，把自己同工人隔离开来。现在我深深感到，单人房和工人宿舍虽然只隔一堵墙，但说明我和工人们的思想已经有了距离，我和工人之间在感情上已经有了一堵墙。
    在老王的耐心帮助下，小刘思想觉悟提高了。他决心牢记毛主席教导，念念不忘阶级斗争，永远为革命、为人民掌好权。就在这天晚上，小刘把铺盖搬了回去，和工人们重新住在一起。
    工人们看到刘向利的转变，都十分高兴。小刘和工人的关系又密切起来了。
