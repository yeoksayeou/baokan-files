The Tanghu Commune Revolutionary Committee, under the guidance of the People's Liberation Army Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team, has been following Chairman Mao's teaching to "never forget class struggle." They have overcome complacency and led the revolutionary masses in an unrelenting attack on the enemies of the proletariat. This has raised the class struggle and line struggle consciousness of the revolutionary masses, strengthened proletarian dictatorship, and fortified the socialist front in the countryside. The entire commune has launched a new wave of revolution and production.

The revolutionary committee of this commune was established in early March. At that time, some members of the committee were satisfied with the achievements of the previous phase of revolutionary criticism, believing that "those who needed to be struggled against have been struggled against, and those who needed to be criticized have been criticized. Now that we hold the power, a few ghosts and snakes cannot cause trouble." Therefore, the momentum for revolutionary criticism was not as strong as before, and the revolutionary vigilance of the proletariat was not as high as before. The comrades of the Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team stationed in this commune believed that this complacency in the face of victory must be immediately corrected. They guided the members of the revolutionary committee to study Chairman Mao's brilliant work "Carry the Revolution Through to the End" and his great teachings that "during the entire transitional period, there are class contradictions, there is class struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie, and there are two lines of struggle between socialism and capitalism. Forgetting the basic theory and basic practice of our party over the past decade or so will lead us astray." They discussed the experiences of class struggle, two lines, and two roads during the Cultural Revolution in this commune, exposed the sabotage activities and evil plots of the current enemies of the proletariat, and raised the revolutionary vigilance and class struggle consciousness of the members of the revolutionary committee. They realized that after the establishment of the revolutionary committee, the enemies of the proletariat did not resign themselves to defeat; they were still struggling desperately. Therefore, any complacency is wrong. Everyone expressed their determination to overcome this wrong thinking, lead the revolutionary masses in an unrelenting attack on the enemies of the proletariat, and firmly, resolutely, and steadily strike down all class enemies.

Except for one member who stayed to handle daily affairs, the other members of the revolutionary committee went to eleven production brigades to focus on class struggle and the struggle between the two lines. After arriving, the first thing they did was to study and apply Chairman Mao's works, learn from poor and lower-middle peasants, and use class struggle as the key link. They used the method of class analysis to observe and solve problems. The chairman of the commune revolutionary committee, Comrade Liu Fane, went to Donghu Brigade and lived, worked, and studied with the poor and lower-middle peasants. Through investigations, he discovered that the leadership of a production team in this brigade had been usurped by a bad element. He immediately, together with the poor and lower-middle peasants, studied Chairman Mao's teachings on class and class struggle and "We must maintain a high degree of vigilance in all our work and be good at distinguishing those who pretend to support the revolution but actually oppose it, and drive them out of our various fronts to safeguard our great victories that have been won and will be won." They mobilized the poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary masses to expose the counter-revolutionary background of this bad element, strip off his disguise of pretending to be active and inciting and deceiving the masses, and seize back the leadership usurped by this bad element. This struggle gave the members of the revolutionary committee and the broad poor and lower-middle peasants a profound education, making their class struggle consciousness stronger and their revolutionary enthusiasm greater. They launched a high tide of revolutionary criticism throughout the commune, thoroughly criticizing and exposing the enemies of the proletariat.

Through the great struggle with the class enemies, the class consciousness and line struggle consciousness of the revolutionary masses have been further heightened. They have become more conscious of learning and applying Mao Zedong Thought, using the perspective of class and class struggle, and the method of class analysis to observe and analyze everything, and have exposed the hidden ghosts and snakes. In the past few years, a "member" from another place moved to the Yangtang Production Brigade of Shangtuo Brigade. During the Cultural Revolution, he ran around causing trouble. Following Chairman Mao's teaching to "never forget class struggle," militia member Yang Xiaoheng actively investigated this person's background and paid attention to his actions. Finally, he found out that this person was originally a released criminal. The revolutionary masses of Shangtuo Brigade immediately put this bad element under strict control again, strengthening the proletarian dictatorship.

The development of the struggle against the enemy has greatly strengthened the proletarian dictatorship and consolidated the socialist collective economy in the countryside. Revolutionary cadres have more enthusiasm and a stronger sense of responsibility. The broad poor and lower-middle peasants have actively proposed many rational suggestions to maintain and consolidate the collective economy, correctly handle the relationship between the state, the collective, and the individual, and vigorously develop the collective economy. Now, the entire commune has launched a new wave of spring production.

    酃湖公社革委会牢记毛主席的伟大教导
    带领群众向阶级敌人不断进攻
    进一步巩固农村社会主义阵地
    新华社长沙二十三日电　湖南衡阳市酃湖公社革命委员会在解放军毛泽东思想宣传队帮助下，遵循毛主席“千万不要忘记阶级斗争”的教导，克服轻敌麻痹情绪，带领广大革命群众不停顿地向无产阶级的敌人发动进攻，提高了广大革命群众的阶级斗争和路线斗争觉悟，强化了无产阶级专政，巩固了社会主义阵地，全公社掀起了革命、生产新高潮。
    这个公社的革命委员会是三月初成立的。当时，革委会个别成员满足于前段革命大批判的成绩，认为“该斗争的斗争了，该批判的也批判了，现在反正印把子在手，几个牛鬼蛇神翻不了天”。因此，搞革命大批判的劲头没有以前那么足了，无产阶级的革命警惕性没有以前那么高了。驻在这个公社的毛泽东思想宣传队的同志认为，在胜利的形势下出现的这种轻敌麻痹情绪，必须立即纠正。他们引导革委会成员学习毛主席《将革命进行到底》这篇光辉著作和“整个过渡时期存在着阶级矛盾、存在着无产阶级和资产阶级的阶级斗争、存在着社会主义和资本主义的两条道路斗争。忘记十几年来我党的这一条基本理论和基本实践，就会要走到斜路上去”的伟大教导，大谈本公社文化大革命中两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的斗争经历，大揭当前无产阶级的敌人的破坏活动和罪恶阴谋，提高了革委会成员的革命警惕性和阶级斗争觉悟。他们认识到，革委会成立后，无产阶级的敌人并没有甘心他们的失败，他们还在作垂死的挣扎。因此，任何轻敌麻痹情绪，都是错误的。大家表示：一定要反掉这种错误思想，带领广大革命群众不停顿地向无产阶级的敌人发动进攻，准、狠、稳地打击一切阶级敌人。
    革委会除留一名委员在家处理日常事务外，其余委员分别到十一个生产大队去抓阶级斗争和两条路线斗争。他们下去以后，第一件事就是活学活用毛主席著作，拜贫下中农为师，以阶级斗争为纲，坚持用阶级分析的方法，去观察和解决问题。公社革命委员会主任刘发能同志来到东湖大队，和贫下中农实行“三同”，进行调查研究，发现这个大队有个生产队的领导权被坏分子篡夺了。他马上和贫下中农一起学习毛主席关于阶级、阶级斗争的论述和“必须在各个工作部门中保持高度的警惕性，善于辨别那些伪装拥护革命而实际反对革命的分子，把他们从我们的各个战线上清洗出去，这样来保卫我们已经取得的和将要取得的伟大的胜利”的教导，发动贫下中农和革命群众，大揭这个坏分子的反革命老底，大剥他伪装积极、挑动和蒙蔽群众的反革命画皮，夺回了被这个坏分子篡夺的领导权。这场斗争给革委会成员和广大贫下中农很深刻的教育，使他们阶级斗争观念更强了，革命干劲更足了。他们在全公社掀起革命大批判高潮，把无产阶级的敌人批深批透，斗倒斗臭。
    通过和阶级敌人的大搏斗，广大革命群众的阶级觉悟和路线斗争觉悟更高了，更加自觉地学习和运用毛泽东思想，用阶级和阶级斗争的观点，用阶级分析的方法去看待一切、分析一切，把隐藏的牛鬼蛇神揪了出来。上托大队向阳生产队前几年从外地迁来一个“社员”，文化大革命中他上窜下跳，专做坏事。民兵杨孝衡按照毛主席“千万不要忘记阶级斗争”的教导，主动调查这个人的来历，注意这个人的行动，最后终于查出这个人原来是一个劳改释放犯。上托大队革命群众马上把这个坏分子重新严加管制起来，加强了无产阶级专政。
    对敌斗争的展开，大大地加强了无产阶级专政，巩固了农村社会主义集体经济。广大革命干部干劲更足了，责任心更强了。广大贫下中农主动提出许多维护和巩固集体经济的合理化建议，正确处理国家、集体、个人三者之间的关系，大力发展集体经济。现在，全公社掀起了春耕生产新高潮。
