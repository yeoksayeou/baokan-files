The reactionary film "Red River Turbulence" attempts to glorify the anti-party conspirator Gao Gang by falsely portraying his line of surrendering and recruiting bandits and buying soldiers as a correct line, and promoting it.

In the film, a crucial character is prominently featured—Wang Guodong, who infiltrates the enemy's militia and bandits to conduct secret activities. Look! He is the one who relays important military intelligence to the guerrilla forces and provides timely and accurate information; he is the one who seizes the opportunity to annihilate the enemy flexibly and proactively; he is the one who creates conditions for the guerrilla forces' activities and ensures safety in the city occupied by the enemy; he is the one who, at the critical moment, executes the traitor Wang Changming, who threatens the overall situation, and secures victory. Especially in the literary script, it is written that after the guerrilla forces enter Yongle Town, they are left with no ammunition and are facing annihilation. At this crucial moment, Wang Guodong incites a mutiny among the militia, turning their guns on the militia commander Yao, turning the battle from defeat to victory, rescuing the guerrilla forces, and annihilating the stubborn enemy. Through these plots, they attempt to prove that without conducting secret activities and inciting mutinies within the enemy's army, and without seizing weapons through the means of surrendering and recruiting bandits, the revolution cannot be victorious.

The film's arrangement of such plots is certainly not accidental. It is a visual representation of the "Brief History of the Shaan-Gan-Ning Border Region," which was written based on Gao Gang's black report. The "Brief History" praises Gao Gang, stating, "For the purpose of seizing weapons and learning to master weapons, they first used various social relationships to infiltrate the army and militia bandits to conduct secret activities and establish secret branches of the Communist Party. Under the circumstances at that time, their work line was undoubtedly the only correct line." To prove that Gao Gang's line is "the only correct one," the "Brief History" proudly declares: Due to their good "secret activities," they established friendly agreements with some "militia bandits." The "militia bandits" not only "provided weapons to the Red Army and cared for the wounded soldiers of the Red Army" but also "many bandits" became Gao Gang's "revolutionary soldiers." With the support of the "militia bandits," they had strong soldiers, abundant ammunition, and sufficient food, winning battles everywhere; when their relationship with the "militia bandits" soured, they fell into isolation and danger, even to the point where the Red Army guerrillas could not stay in the villages. Here, they inadvertently reveal the true content of the so-called "correct line" they boast about. The character Wang Guodong in the reactionary film "Red River Turbulence" is a representative of this supposed "correct line." Due to his "secret activities," he not only helped the guerrilla forces win battles but also recruited a group of people from the militia bandits and transformed them into "revolutionary soldiers."

This line is diametrically opposed to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. It does not mobilize the masses, organize the masses, and arm the masses, following the line of "expanding local militia, local Red Army, to expanding the main force Red Army"; instead, it recruits soldiers and surrenders bandits. It separates from the masses, relies solely on "secret work," and uses the method of "inciting mutinies" to gather a group of followers, roaming east and west, "unwilling to do hard work to establish a base area and establish the people's government."

In the "Brief History," the creators also admit that Gao Gang's "correct line" was learned from "bandits," "local tyrants," and "mountain kings," and that Gao Gang once called on comrades to "occupy the mountains." Stripping off the disguise of the "correct line" reveals the true nature of a variant of the "Wang Ming line"; tearing off the mask of Gao Gang's representative of the "correct line" exposes the original form of a bandit who rose to power through surrendering and recruiting bandits. This line of surrendering and recruiting bandits and occupying mountains as kings was thoroughly criticized by Chairman Mao as early as the 1929 Ancient Town Conference. However, the reactionary film "Red River Turbulence" shamelessly attempts to revive it more than thirty years later.

Even more shamelessly, the creators loudly proclaim that "Red River Turbulence" writes about "armed struggle, with international significance." They openly shout that this film should be shown in Asia, Africa, and Latin America, attempting to poison the revolutionary people of Asia, Africa, and Latin America with Gao Gang's bandit line and "Left" adventurism, to resist the spread of the great Mao Zedong Thought. Therefore, we must tear off the mask of Gao Gang's "correct line" and throw the traitor Gao Gang and the reactionary film "Red River Turbulence" and its creators' backers into the garbage heap of history!

### 撕下高岗“正确路线”的画皮

    撕下高岗“正确路线”的画皮
    北京卫戍区某部五好战士　杨志松
    反动影片《红河激浪》为了美化反党野心家高岗，硬把高岗执行的招降纳叛、招兵买马的流寇主义路线冒充正确路线，加以鼓吹。
    影片中突出安排了一个打入民团土匪内部进行秘密活动的重要人物——王国栋。看！给游击队通风报信，及时准确传递重要军事情报的是他；灵活主动抓住了歼敌战机的是他；在敌人占领的城市里，为游击队的活动创造条件，保证安全的又是他；在关键时刻处决了危及全局的叛徒——王长命，保障了胜利的还是他。特别是在文学剧本里，写游击队攻进永乐镇以后，打得弹尽援绝、面临全军覆没的绝境时，王国栋突然发动民团哗变，掉转枪口，对准了民团司令姚贼，使战局转败为胜，救出了游击队，歼灭了顽固的敌人。他们通过这些情节力图证明，如果不在敌军内部搞秘密活动和策动兵变，不通过招降纳叛的途径夺取武装，革命就不能胜利。
    影片所以安排这样的情节，决不是偶然的。它是那部根据高岗的黑报告所编写的《陕甘宁边区简史》的形象化。《简史》吹捧高岗“为着夺取武装并学习掌握武装的目的，他们都首先利用各种社会关系打入军队及民团土匪中进行秘密活动，建立共产党的秘密支部。在当时情况下，他们的工作路线毫无疑问的是唯一正确的路线。”为了证明高岗这条路线是“唯一正确”的，《简史》洋洋得意地宣称：由于他们“秘密活动”搞得好，便和一些“民团土匪”“订立了友好协定”。“民团土匪”不仅“送军火给红军，收容和照顾红军的伤兵”，而且，“不少土匪”还“变成”了高岗的“革命战士”。有了“民团土匪”的支持，他们就兵强、弹多、粮足，到处打胜仗；和“民团土匪”的关系搞僵了，他们就“陷于孤立危困的境地”，甚至弄得“红军游击队不能在村里住”。在这里，他们不打自招地供认出他们吹嘘的“正确路线”的真正内容。反动影片《红河激浪》中的王国栋，就是体现这一条所谓“正确路线”的代表。由于他的“秘密活动”，不仅帮助游击队打了胜仗，而且还从民团土匪中拉出来一批人，并把他们改造成了“革命战士”。
    这一条路线，是与毛主席的无产阶级革命路线针锋相对的。它不是发动群众，组织群众，武装群众，“走由扩大地方赤卫队、地方红军到扩大主力红军的路线”；而是招兵买马，招降纳叛。它脱离群众，依靠单纯的“秘密工作”，用“策动兵变”的方法拉一杆子人马，东游西击，“不愿意做艰苦工作建立根据地，建立人民群众的政权”。
    在《简史》中，炮制者也承认，高岗的“正确路线”是从“土匪”、“土霸”、“山大王”那里学来的，还说高岗曾经“号召同志们来这里占山头”。剥掉“正确路线”的伪装就露出了货真价实的变种的“王明路线”的真相；撕下高岗“正确路线”代表者的画皮，就现出了招降纳叛起家的流寇的原形。这种招降纳叛、占山为王的流寇主义路线，早在一九二九年的古田会议上，就被毛主席彻底批判了。可是反动影片《红河激浪》在三十多年以后，还不知羞耻地为它招魂。
    更无耻的是，炮制者还大肆鼓吹《红河激浪》写了“武装斗争，有国际意义”。公然叫嚷这个电影要拿到亚、非、拉去放映，妄图用高岗的流寇主义、“左”倾冒险主义的私货去毒害亚、非、拉革命人民，以抵制伟大的毛泽东思想的传播。因此，我们一定要撕下高岗“正确路线”的画皮，把叛徒高岗和反动影片《红河激浪》及其炮制者的总后台统统扔到历史的垃圾堆里去！
