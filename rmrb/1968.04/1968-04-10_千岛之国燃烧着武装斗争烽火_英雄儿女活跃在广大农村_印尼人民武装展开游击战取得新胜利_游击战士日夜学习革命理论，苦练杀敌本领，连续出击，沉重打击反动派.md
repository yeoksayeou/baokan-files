The revolutionary center task and highest form is to seize power by armed force, to resolve issues through war. — Mao Zedong

The thousand-island nation is ablaze with the flames of armed struggle. Heroic sons and daughters are active in the vast countryside. Indonesian people's armed forces have launched guerrilla warfare and achieved new victories. Guerrilla fighters study revolutionary theory day and night, train hard to fight the enemy, launch continuous attacks, and deal heavy blows to the reactionaries.

New China News Agency, April 9th: The Indonesian people's armed forces have continuously struck the reactionary rule of the Suharto-Nasution fascist military regime in the first three months of this year, achieving inspiring new victories.

The people of East Java, rich in revolutionary tradition, have launched guerrilla warfare in rural areas where the reactionary rule is weak. Their guerrilla activities cover the vast rural areas around the towns of Malang, Kediri, Surabaya, Madiun, and Wedi. By mid-March, guerrilla fighters, in close cooperation with local farmers, had executed 96 local tyrants, landlords, evil gentry, and reactionary officials. Jakarta newspapers revealed that the guerrilla fighters "not only use automatic weapons but also hand grenades." The revolutionary actions of the guerrilla fighters have scared the local reactionary authorities, landlords, and evil gentry, making them "unable to sleep and rest."

It is reported that to cultivate military cadres, the people's armed forces have established training camps and training grounds in the rugged mountains of East Java. They study revolutionary theory day and night and train hard to fight the enemy. Western news agencies admit that the people's armed forces "have good weapons," which were seized from the Indonesian reactionary army.

Under the inspiration of the rise of the people's armed forces in East Java, 330 patriotic soldiers and police stationed in Malang turned their guns around and launched an armed uprising on February 15th, giving the Suharto-Nasution fascist military regime a heavy blow. Western news agencies revealed that after this, there were continuous instances of people "carrying weapons and leaving their units" in the Indonesian reactionary army, and most of these people joined the Communist Party.

The reactionary military authorities in East Java are anxious and worried about the growing people's armed forces. The Associated Press admitted that the reactionary military authorities in East Java are "concerned about the increasing threat of the people's armed forces," although they regularly dispatch reactionary troops for counter-revolutionary "encirclement and suppression," they "cannot stop the development of the Communist Party."

The people's armed forces active in West Kalimantan have continuously smashed the reactionary army's counter-revolutionary "encirclement and suppression" in the first three months of this year, achieving new victories. The Indonesian fascist regime was frightened by the flames of the people's armed struggle in West Kalimantan and, over the past half year, dispatched more than 7,000 reactionary troops from all over the country for "encirclement and suppression." The brave people's armed forces in West Kalimantan flexibly and agilely struck the enemy. From January 2nd to now, they have engaged in dozens of heroic battles with the army's assault brigade, the Sumatra assault paratroop battalion, and the "elite" Silivangie Regiment of the Indonesian fascist regime. On February 11th, a group of 40 people from the people's armed forces ambushed a company of the Sumatra assault paratroop battalion at Mount Klingkong and then moved to a safe area. According to the greatly reduced figures published by the West Kalimantan military commander Witono, several months ago, 75 enemies were killed by the people's armed forces.

In the face of the enemy's heavy encirclement, the people's armed forces in West Kalimantan have also developed production through self-reliance. It is reported that in the Ngilu area alone, the people's armed forces have cultivated 15 hectares of land with local farmers and planted crops.

The people's armed forces in East Kalimantan, after attacking an enemy outpost and seizing a batch of weapons last December, have been actively launching attacks against the enemy since this year. The East Kalimantan military commander Mun Parhadimuryo recently said worriedly that the people's armed forces have "increased their activities in East Kalimantan."

The Indonesian fascist military regime is mobilizing troops and actively plotting new conspiracies, attempting to annihilate the Indonesian people's armed forces. The commanders of the Army Strategic Reserve Command, the Army Assault Brigade, and various military regions held secret meetings in Bandung and Bogor in January and March, shouting to "crush the subversive activities of the Indonesian Communist Party." The Indonesian reactionary authorities also held meetings with the Rahman puppet regime in "Malaysia" on the West Kalimantan border to formulate joint reactionary measures for the "encirclement and suppression" of the people's armed forces in West Kalimantan.

The Suharto-Nasution fascist regime appears strong but is actually weak. The Indonesian people's armed forces will continue to smash the enemy's frenzied attacks and achieve more brilliant victories.

    千岛之国燃烧着武装斗争烽火　英雄儿女活跃在广大农村
    印尼人民武装展开游击战取得新胜利
    游击战士日夜学习革命理论，苦练杀敌本领，连续出击，沉重打击反动派
    新华社九日讯　印度尼西亚人民武装力量今年头三个月不断地打击苏哈托—纳苏蒂安法西斯军人政权的反动统治，取得了鼓舞人心的新战绩。
    富有革命传统的东爪哇人民，在反动统治薄弱的农村地区展开了游击战。他们的游击活动范围包括东爪哇玛琅、谏义里、外南梦、任抹、勿里达等市镇周围的广阔农村。到三月中旬为止，游击战士在当地农民的密切配合下，处决了九十六个恶霸地主、土豪劣绅和反动官吏。雅加达报纸透露，游击战士“不仅使用自动武器，而且也使用手榴弹”。游击战士的革命行动，吓得印尼地方反动当局、恶霸地主和土豪劣绅“不能睡觉和安宁”。
    据报道，为了培养军事骨干，人民武装在东爪哇崎岖的山区，设立了干部训练营和练兵场。他们在那里日夜学习革命理论，苦练杀敌本领。西方通讯社承认，人民武装力量“拥有良好的武器”，他们的武器是从印尼反动军队手中夺得的。
    在东爪哇人民武装力量兴起的鼓舞下，驻在玛琅的印尼三百三十名爱国官兵和警察，于今年二月十五日掉转枪口，举行武装起义，给了苏哈托—纳苏蒂安法西斯军人政权当头一棒。西方通讯社透露，在这以后，在印尼反动军队中，不断有人“携带武器离开他们的队伍，这些人大部分投奔共产党去了”。
    东爪哇反动军事当局对人民武装力量的日益发展恐慌不安。美联社供认，东爪哇反动军事当局对人民武装“越来越大的威胁感到担忧”，尽管他们定期派遣反动军队进行反革命“围剿”，“但无法制止共产党的发展”。
    活跃在西加里曼丹的人民武装，在今年头三个月不断地粉碎反动军队的反革命“围剿”，取得了新的胜利。印尼法西斯政权被西加里曼丹人民武装斗争的烽火吓破了胆，半年来从全国各地派遣七千多名反动军队前往“围剿”。英勇的西加里曼丹人民武装机动灵活地打击敌人。他们从今年一月二日到现在，同前往“围剿”的陆军突击团、苏门答腊突击伞兵营和印尼法西斯政权的“王牌军”西利万吉师库章营展开了几十次英勇的战斗。二月十一日，一支人民武装四十人，在克林康山伏击来犯的苏门答腊突击伞兵营的一个连，然后主动转移到安全地带。据西加里曼丹军区头目维托诺公布的被大大缩小了的数字，几个月来被人民武装击毙的敌人有七十五名。
    西加里曼丹人民武装在敌人的重重围困面前，还自力更生，发展生产。据报道，仅在恩吉卢地区，人民武装同当地农民就开垦了十五公顷土地，种上了庄稼。
    东加里曼丹人民武装去年十二月袭击了一个敌军哨所，缴获了一批武器之后，今年以来不断主动出击，打击敌人。东加里曼丹军区头目蒙·帕尔哈迪穆尔约最近忧心忡忡地说，人民武装力量“已经增加了他们在东加里曼丹的活动”。
    印尼法西斯军人政权正在调兵遣将，积极策划新的阴谋，妄图消灭印尼人民武装力量。陆军战略后备司令部、陆军突击团和各军区头目们一月和三月先后在万隆和茂物召开黑会，叫嚷要“粉碎印尼共产党的颠覆活动”。印尼反动当局还在西加里曼丹边界同“马来西亚”拉赫曼傀儡集团举行会议，制定共同“围剿”西加里曼丹人民武装的反动措施。
    苏哈托—纳苏蒂安法西斯政权貌似强大，实际上是虚弱的。印尼人民武装力量必将不断地粉碎敌人的疯狂进攻，取得更加辉煌的战果。
