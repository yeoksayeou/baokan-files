The red sun rises over the world, and the cheers echo through the mountains and rivers. Revolutionary masses across the nation are celebrating the publication of Chairman Mao's latest directive on revolutionary committees. We are determined to carry out Chairman Mao's latest directive to the letter, without any deviation.

In his latest directive, Chairman Mao instructs us to "organize a revolutionary leadership team that connects with the masses." Chairman Mao's guidance is of great significance for the construction of revolutionary committees. In the stormy winds of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, we have deeply felt that only by organizing a revolutionary leadership team can we implement Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, lead the masses in a victorious struggle against the class enemy, and ensure that the proletarian revolutionary power remains unchanged. Therefore, since the establishment of our school's revolutionary committee on April 1, 1967, we have, with the help of the military training team, focused on the revolutionization of the leadership team.

We know that for a leadership team to be revolutionary, the fundamental principle is to arm oneself with Mao Zedong Thought. Our revolutionary committee insists on collective study of Chairman Mao's works for two and a half days each week, and requires each committee member to study and apply Mao Zedong Thought in their daily lives, continuously promoting their ideological revolutionization. We conduct a monthly review of the situation regarding the study and application of Chairman Mao's works. Among the committee members, we have also initiated the "one helps one, one pairs with one" activity, helping each other to solve ideological problems and raise class consciousness.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "The rectification movement is a 'universal Marxist educational movement.' Rectification means that the whole Party learns Marxism through criticism and self-criticism. During the rectification, we will certainly learn more Marxism." We have conducted several rectification campaigns, mobilizing the masses to provide feedback on the revolutionary committee through various forms, then compiling everyone's feedback, organizing the revolutionary committee members to study Chairman Mao's relevant teachings, conducting self-criticism and criticism, and engaging in criticism and self-criticism. In this way, we can promote achievements, correct shortcomings, and unify and raise the ideological understanding of the revolutionary committee members.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "The most fundamental principle of reforming state organs is to connect with the masses." To achieve revolutionization, the revolutionary committee must closely connect with the masses and take root among them. We have implemented a system where standing committee members take turns to be on duty, with committee members going deep among the masses, practicing face-to-face leadership, accepting the supervision of the masses, studying together with the masses, exposing and criticizing our own shortcomings together, jointly conducting a thorough criticism of the revolution, and jointly promoting the educational revolution. Committee members also frequently hold discussions with the masses, seeking their opinions, and have set up suggestion books in each class to collect the masses' criticisms. In this way, we avoid being detached from the masses and can timely hear the voices of the masses, understand their opinions and demands. Problems can also be discovered and solved in a timely manner.

We have done very little in the revolutionization of the leadership team. In the future, we will definitely follow Chairman Mao's latest directive on revolutionary committees, strengthen the revolutionization of the revolutionary committee from all aspects. Especially, we must take loyalty to the great leader Chairman Mao, loyalty to the great Mao Zedong Thought, and loyalty to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line as the highest standard to measure our words and deeds, fully implement Chairman Mao's various latest directives, and build the revolutionary committee into a battle command post armed with Mao Zedong Thought. We will lead all revolutionary teachers, students, and staff to achieve a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

    建设一个革命化的联系群众的领导班子
    河北省石家庄市新一中革命委员会
    红日东升照寰宇，欢声雷动震山河。全国无产阶级革命派都在欢呼毛主席关于革命委员会的最新指示的发表。毛主席的最新指示，我们决心句句照办，不折不扣地执行。
    毛主席在最新指示中，要求我们“组织起一个革命化的联系群众的领导班子”。毛主席这一教导，对于革委会的建设具有极为重大的意义。我们在无产阶级文化大革命的急风暴雨中深切地感到，只有组织起一个革命化的领导班子，才能贯彻执行毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，才能带领群众向阶级敌人进行胜利的进攻，才能保证无产阶级革命政权永远不改变颜色。因此，从去年四月一日，我校革命委员会成立以来，就在军训团的帮助下，注意抓了领导班子的革命化。
    我们知道，领导班子要革命化，根本的根本就是要用毛泽东思想武装自己的头脑。我们革委会坚持每周有两个半天集体学习毛主席著作，并且要求每个委员平时都要学好用好毛泽东思想，不断促进自己的思想革命化。我们每月检查一次活学活用毛主席著作的情况。在委员之间，还开展了“一帮一，一对红”的活动，互相帮助解决思想问题，提高阶级觉悟。
    毛主席教导我们：“整风运动是一个‘普遍的马克思主义的教育运动’。整风就是全党通过批评和自我批评来学习马克思主义。在整风中间，我们一定可以更多地学到一些马克思主义。”我们开展过多次整风，发动群众利用各种形式对革委会提意见，然后把大家的意见集中起来，组织革委会成员学习毛主席的有关教导，进行斗私批修，开展批评和自我批评。这样来发扬成绩，纠正缺点，统一和提高革命委员会成员的思想认识。
    毛主席教导我们：“国家机关的改革，最根本的一条，就是联系群众。”革委会要实现革命化，必须密切联系群众，扎根于群众之中。我们实行了常委值班制，委员都深入群众，实行面对面的领导，接受群众的监督，和群众一起学习，一起亮私斗私，共同搞好革命的大批判，共同搞好教育革命。委员们还经常到群众中开座谈会，征求意见，在各个班设立了意见本，收集群众的批评。这样，就避免了浮在上面，脱离群众，可以及时听到群众的呼声，了解到群众的意见和要求。有问题，也能及时发现，及时解决。
    我们在领导班子革命化方面做得还很不够。今后，我们一定要遵照毛主席关于革命委员会的最新指示，从各方面来加强革委会的革命化建设。特别是要把忠于伟大领袖毛主席，忠于伟大的毛泽东思想，忠于毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，作为衡量自己言行的最高标准，全面落实毛主席的各项最新指示，把革委会建设成用毛泽东思想武装起来的战斗指挥部，带领全校革命师生员工，去夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利。
