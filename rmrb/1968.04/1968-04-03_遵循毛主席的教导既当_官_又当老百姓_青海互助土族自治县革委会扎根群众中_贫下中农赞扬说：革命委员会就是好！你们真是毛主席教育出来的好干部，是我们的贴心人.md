The great teacher Chairman Mao teaches us: "We Communists are not seeking office, but are seeking revolution. We must have a thorough spirit of revolution. We must not for a moment forget the masses. As long as we do not forget the masses, we shall be invincible." After the establishment of the Revolutionary Committee of Huizu Autonomous County, Qinghai Province, in November last year, the members of the committee seriously studied this great directive of Chairman Mao, discussed how to live up to Chairman Mao's expectations and the people's trust, and how to handle power for the proletariat. After discussion, they agreed that the work of the county Revolutionary Committee should focus on the countryside. Only by going deep into the masses of poor and lower-middle peasants can we understand the needs and wishes of the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants, better convey Chairman Mao's latest instructions and the Party's policies to the masses, and better promote our own ideological revolutionization, and lead the revolution and production of the whole county.

After the members of the committee unified their thoughts, they carried Mao Zedong's works and luggage, crossed mountains and rivers on foot, and went to various communes, production brigades, and production teams. They studied Chairman Mao's works with the poor and lower-middle peasants, fought against selfishness and revisionism, discussed how to handle power for the proletariat, and lived, ate, and worked with the poor and lower-middle peasants. They valued the tradition of our Party, learned from the PLA's three-eight style, and helped the hosts with chores such as fetching water and sweeping the yard. They also contacted the Xinhua Bookstore to bring many of Chairman Mao's works and "Quotations from Chairman Mao Zedong" to the countryside for the masses to purchase. They were not afraid of hardship or fatigue, going wherever it was difficult. The Jiading Commune's Xiahe Brigade is located in a deep and long gorge in a big mountain. From the county Revolutionary Committee to this brigade, there is a distance of about 300 li. In the past, no cadres from the county had ever been there. Soon after the establishment of the county Revolutionary Committee, the chairman and two other comrades came to the Xiahe Brigade, bringing the poor and lower-middle peasants the revolutionary treasures of Chairman Mao, the latest instructions of Chairman Mao, and the care and warmth of Chairman Mao. The poor and lower-middle peasants were excited and said: "The Revolutionary Committee is good! You are indeed good cadres educated by Chairman Mao, our trusted friends. Please come often to convey the instructions of Chairman Mao to us! The more you come, the brighter our hearts will be."

The members of the Revolutionary Committee of Huizu Autonomous County paid great attention to collecting the valuable opinions of the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants on revolution and production, and then took them back to the masses to form correct leadership. Everywhere they went, they paid great attention to discovering the good people and good deeds of the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants who read Chairman Mao's books, listened to Chairman Mao's words, and acted according to Chairman Mao's instructions. They passed on these good people and good deeds from one brigade to another, from one commune to another, and discovered typical examples and models. Now, they have established typical examples in the whole county, including pioneers in breaking private interests and establishing public interests, good brigade leaders who are dedicated to the collective, party branch secretaries who are loyal to Mao Zedong Thought and closely linked with the masses, and typical units that have gained experience in holding Mao Zedong Thought study classes.

Chairman Mao said: "To study Marxism, one must not only learn from books, but mainly through class struggle, practical work, and getting close to the workers and peasants, can one truly learn it." The members of the Revolutionary Committee of Huizu Autonomous County went deep into the poor and lower-middle peasants, and more deeply understood the wisdom of Chairman Mao's teachings. Recently, they summarized six major gains from going deep into the poor and lower-middle peasants: First, the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants have unlimited love, faith, admiration, and loyalty to our great leader Chairman Mao, and they study and apply Chairman Mao's works, linking theory with practice. The leading members of the county Revolutionary Committee often stay with the poor and lower-middle peasants, further deepening their proletarian feelings of being infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao, infinitely loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, and infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. Second, there is sharp and complex class struggle in the countryside, and the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants have a high sense of revolutionary vigilance, which deepens the class struggle consciousness of the Revolutionary Committee members. Third, through studying Chairman Mao's works with the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants, promoting revolution and production, and living, eating, and working together, they deeply understood the revolutionary wishes and demands of the poor and lower-middle peasants, strengthening their class viewpoint and mass viewpoint. Fourth, through learning from the poor and lower-middle peasants' mutual care, love, and help, their class consciousness was enhanced, and the unity among the members of the Revolutionary Committee was strengthened. Fifth, through learning from the poor and lower-middle peasants' fearlessness of difficulties, hard work, and building socialist new villages with great revolutionary spirit, their revolutionary spirit was enhanced. Sixth, the poor and lower-middle peasants' thrifty and simple style also deeply educated the members of the Revolutionary Committee. They said, "In the future, when we make plans and do things, we must follow Chairman Mao's teachings of 'building the country through thrift' and 'saving to make revolution,' and learn from the poor and lower-middle peasants' thrifty spirit."

The members of the county Revolutionary Committee often went deep into the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants, which also greatly promoted the revolutionization of the work of the Revolutionary Committee office, improved work efficiency, and enhanced the prestige of the Revolutionary Committee. The masses reflected: "The number of people sitting in the office of the Revolutionary Committee has decreased, the number of meetings has decreased, the number of documents and reports has decreased, and the single-minded business viewpoint has decreased. We firmly support and firmly endorse such a Revolutionary Committee!"

    遵循毛主席的教导既当“官”又当老百姓  青海互助土族自治县革委会扎根群众中
    贫下中农赞扬说：革命委员会就是好！你们真是毛主席教育出来的好干部，是我们的贴心人
    据新华社西宁二日电　伟大导师毛主席教导我们：“我们共产党人不是要做官，而是要革命，我们人人要有彻底的革命精神，我们不要有一时一刻脱离群众。只要我们不脱离群众，我们就一定会胜利。”青海省互助土族自治县革命委员会在去年十一月成立后，革委会的成员便认真学习了毛主席的这一伟大指示，讨论了怎样才能不辜负毛主席的期望和人民的信任，为无产阶级掌好权、用好权的问题。经过讨论，大家认为，县革命委员会的工作重点应当在农村。只有深入到贫下中农群众中去，才能了解广大贫下中农的需要和愿望，才能更好地把毛主席的最新指示和党的方针政策交给群众，也才能更好地促进自己的思想革命化，领导好全县的革命和生产。
    全体成员统一了思想以后，就揣着毛主席著作，背着行李，跋山涉水，步行到各个公社、生产大队和生产队，和贫下中农一起学习毛主席著作，一起斗私批修，一起商量为无产阶级掌好权、用好权的大事，并且和贫下中农同吃、同住、同劳动。他们重视发扬我党的光荣传统，学习解放军的三八作风，一住到贫下中农家里，就帮助房东担水，扫院子。他们还和新华书店取得联系，每次下乡，带上许多毛主席著作和《毛主席语录》，供广大社员选购。他们不怕苦，不怕累，哪里艰苦，就到哪里去。这个县的加定公社下河大队，位于一座大山中的一个深长峡谷中，从县革委会所在地到这个大队，约有三百里的路程。过去，县上的干部一个也没有到过这里。县革委会成立不久，革委会主任和另外两位同志，就来到了下河大队，给这里的贫下中农送来了毛主席的革命宝书，送来了毛主席的最新指示，送来了毛主席的关怀和温暖。贫下中农激动地说：“革命委员会就是好！你们真是毛主席教育出来的好干部，是我们的贴心人。你们要常来给我们传达毛主席他老人家的指示啊！你们来的次数越多，我们的心就越亮堂。”
    互助土族自治县革命委员会的成员在农村中，十分注意把广大贫下中农群众对革命和生产的宝贵意见集中起来，然后又拿到群众中坚持下去，以形成正确的领导。他们每到一地，都很重视发现广大贫下中农群众中读毛主席的书、听毛主席的话、照毛主席的指示办事的好人好事，把这些好人好事，从这个大队传到那个大队，从这个公社传到那个公社，从中发现典型和榜样。现在，他们在全县范围内树立起的典型，有破私立公的闯将、一心为集体的好队长，有忠于毛泽东思想密切联系群众的支部书记，以及在办毛泽东思想学习班方面取得了经验的典型单位。
    毛主席说：“学习马克思主义，不但要从书本上学，主要地还要通过阶级斗争、工作实践和接近工农群众，才能真正学到。”互助土族自治县革委会成员深入到贫下中农中去，更加深刻地领会到毛主席这一教导的英明伟大。最近，他们总结了深入贫下中农群众的六大收获：一、广大贫下中农对我们伟大领袖毛主席无限热爱、无限信仰、无限崇拜、无限忠诚，对毛主席著作学一点，用一点，理论联系实际。县革委会领导成员经常和贫下中农在一起，更进一步加深了自己无限忠于毛主席、无限忠于毛泽东思想、无限忠于毛主席无产阶级革命路线的无产阶级感情。二、农村中存在着尖锐、复杂的阶级斗争，广大贫下中农有着高度的革命警惕性，使革委会成员加深了阶级斗争观念。三、通过和广大贫下中农同学习毛主席著作，同抓革命，促生产，以及同吃、同住、同劳动，深入地了解了他们的革命愿望和要求，增强了阶级观点和群众观点。四、通过学习贫下中农之间互相关心、互相爱护、互相帮助的无产阶级感情，提高了阶级觉悟，增强了革委会成员之间的团结。五、通过学习贫下中农不怕困难，艰苦奋斗，建设社会主义新农村的大无畏革命气魄，增强了革命精神。六、贫下中农勤俭节约、艰苦朴素的作风，也深深地教育了革命委员会的成员。他们说，我们今后订计划，办事情，一定要遵照毛主席“勤俭建国”“要节约闹革命”的教导，学习贫下中农勤俭节约的精神。
    县革命委员会成员经常深入到广大贫下中农群众中去，也有力地促进了革命委员会机关工作的革命化，提高了工作效率，提高了革命委员会的威信。群众反映说：“革命委员会坐办公室的人少了，开会少了，公文报表少了，单纯业务观点少了。这样的革命委员会，我们坚决支持，坚决拥护！”
