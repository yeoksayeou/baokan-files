The governments of the People's Republic of China, Tanzania, and Zambia signed three protocols regarding the construction of the Tanzania-Zambia Railway on April 8 in Dar es Salaam, the capital of Tanzania. According to the agreement reached by the three governments in Beijing last September, the railway, which will be built with Chinese aid, will soon begin surveying and design work.

The construction of the Tanzania-Zambia Railway will help develop the national economies of these two countries, strengthen economic ties, friendly exchanges, and mutual support between East and Central Africa.

The three protocols signed on April 8 are: the protocol on the provision of loans for the Tanzania-Zambia Railway, the protocol on the dispatch, treatment, and working conditions of Chinese technical personnel for the construction of the Tanzania-Zambia Railway, and the protocol on the survey and design work for the Tanzania-Zambia Railway.

These protocols were agreed upon after a week of meetings between the representatives of the three countries.

The protocols were signed by Jamal, the Tanzanian Minister of Finance, Mwenda, the Zambian Minister of Finance, and Zhou Boqing, the Chargé d'Affaires of the Chinese Embassy in Tanzania, representing their respective governments.

In his speech at the signing ceremony, Jamal thanked the Chinese government and people for their assistance in building the Tanzania-Zambia Railway. He expressed his determination to work closely with Zambia, his sister country, to use the railway to strengthen the economies of the two countries.

Mwenda, the Zambian Minister of Finance, also expressed his gratitude to the Chinese government and people for their help in building the railway. He pointed out that the completion of the railway would benefit the hundreds of millions of people in Africa.

Zhou Boqing also spoke at the signing ceremony. He expressed his belief that the friendship between the Chinese people and the people of Tanzania and Zambia would be further strengthened during the construction of the Tanzania-Zambia Railway.

During the meeting, the Tanzanian and Zambian delegations held a reception for the Chinese delegation. The second vice president of Tanzania, Kawawa, attended the reception.
