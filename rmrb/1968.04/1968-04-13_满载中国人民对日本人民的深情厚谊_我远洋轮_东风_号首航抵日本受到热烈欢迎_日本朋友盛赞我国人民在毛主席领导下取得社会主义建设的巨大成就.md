Japanese people of various circles held a grand rally at the central wharf of Yokohama Port in the afternoon of April 11 to warmly welcome the maiden voyage of China's self-designed and manufactured 10,000-ton ocean-going cargo ship, the "Dongfeng," to Japan.

Today, the central wharf of Yokohama, where the "Dongfeng" is docked, is decorated with red flags and bustling with excitement. Large banners hang along the shore, reading: "Long live the invincible Mao Zedong Thought!" "Long live the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China!" "Long live the fighting friendship between the peoples of China and Japan!"

More than 200 Japanese friends from various circles in Tokyo and Yokohama, as well as representatives of Chinese residents in Japan, attended the welcome ceremony. The entire crew of the "Dongfeng" also attended.

Ito Takeo, Vice Chairman of the Japan-China Friendship Association (Genuine), delivered a welcome speech. He said: Under the leadership of the great leader Chairman Mao, the Chinese people have relied on their own efforts, worked hard, and in a short period of time, successfully built the 10,000-ton ocean-going cargo ship "Dongfeng," raising China's shipbuilding industry to the world's advanced level. He said that this proves that once the greatest guiding ideology of the proletariat in the contemporary world—Mao Zedong Thought—is grasped by the broad masses of the people, it will become an inexhaustible force.

Ito said: The maiden voyage of the "Dongfeng" to Japan has greatly encouraged the Japanese people who insist on anti-imperialism and anti-revisionism and yearn for Sino-Japanese friendship, and has dealt a heavy blow to American imperialism, revisionism, and the Japanese reactionaries.

Ito expressed that the Japanese people will definitely join hands with the Chinese people to fight against the common enemy, American imperialism and its lackeys, to the end.

Hagiwara Sadashi, Executive Director of the Japan External Trade Organization, said: Just as the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China is heading towards comprehensive victory, the "Dongfeng" has arrived in Japan, which has greatly encouraged the Japanese people. He said: The completion of the "Dongfeng" is a brilliant achievement of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line in China's shipbuilding industry.

Hagiwara condemned the Sato government's continued pursuit of American policies hostile to China. He said: The Japanese friendly trade circles will definitely fight to overthrow the Sato reactionary government, to develop friendly relations between the peoples of China and Japan, and to enhance the fighting friendship between the two peoples.

Captain Lin Zuyi of the "Dongfeng" expressed heartfelt thanks to the Japanese people of various circles for their enthusiastic welcome and cordial reception in his speech. He said: The "Dongfeng" carries the deep friendship of the Chinese people for the Japanese people on its maiden voyage to Japan. The entire crew of the "Dongfeng" will strive to enhance the friendship between the peoples of China and Japan and promote friendly trade exchanges between the two countries.

After the welcome ceremony, all the Japanese attendees boarded the ship to inspect the interior facilities.

The "Dongfeng" set sail from Qingdao, China, on the morning of April 6 and arrived at Yokohama Port in the afternoon of April 9. It will also call at the ports of Nagoya, Kobe, Osaka, and Kawasumi for cargo operations.
