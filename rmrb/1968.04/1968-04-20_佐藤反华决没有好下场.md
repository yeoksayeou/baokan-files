	Sato's Anti-China Stance Will Not End Well
	Editorial

	The reactionary leaders of Japan, such as Sato Eisaku, have recently been making provocative statements regarding Sino-Japanese relations. They attack China, proclaiming that they will adopt the same principles towards both the Kuomintang and Beijing, blatantly creating the illusion of "two Chinas." Furthermore, they declare that the Japanese government will continue to adhere to the notorious policy of "political and economic separation" in its relations with China. This once again demonstrates that the Sato government is firmly aligned with U.S. imperialism and stubbornly maintains its policy of hostility towards China.

	The Sato government has stated that, "to improve overall Sino-Japanese relations," China must "acknowledge" the principle of "non-interference in internal affairs." This is a shameless tactic of accusing others of what one is guilty of. The facts are clear: it is U.S. imperialism and its faithful lackey, the Japanese reactionaries, who have consistently and brutally interfered in China's internal affairs and actively prepared to launch an invasion against China. The Sato government continues to collude closely with the Kuomintang, our enemy, and plots the "two Chinas" scheme. Now, it is brazenly provoking the Chinese people with the absurd claim that the Kuomintang in Taiwan is "also China." It harbors ambitions to reoccupy our territory of Taiwan. The Sato government not only formulates one military attack plan after another with China as the hypothetical enemy but also seeks to strengthen the U.S.-Japan "security treaty," which is directed against China and the peoples of Asia. The Sato government's blatant interference in China's internal affairs and its rampant anti-China actions are undeniable. Its plot to launch an invasion against socialist China is also undeniable.

	While Sato and his ilk loudly proclaim that they "will make sincere efforts to expand Sino-Japanese trade," they simultaneously set up numerous obstacles to expanding trade between the two countries and insist on the policy of "political and economic separation." This is an attempt to politically oppose China while economically gaining benefits. We must warn the Sato government that their schemes will definitely fail.

	While Sato is rampantly anti-China, he claims that he is "not satisfied with the current state of Sino-Japanese relations" and that he has a "forward-looking attitude," "hoping for an improvement in Sino-Japanese relations." This is sheer hypocrisy! The actions of the Sato government are completely contrary to improving Sino-Japanese relations. Especially since the latter half of last year, it has taken a series of frantic anti-China measures. Sato himself visited our territory of Taiwan to engage in conspiratorial activities, followed by "inviting" the Kuomintang leader to "visit Japan," furthering his collusion with this political corpse that the Chinese people despise. He visited various reactionary leaders in Southeast Asia, actively forming an anti-China encirclement. He has intensified his collusion with U.S. imperialism, actively participating in the U.S. imperialist's Asian strategy aimed at China, turning Japan into a nuclear war base for U.S. imperialism to launch an invasion against China. For Sato and his ilk to claim that they are "hoping" to "improve" Sino-Japanese relations is absurd!

	The facts fully prove that the Sato government is willing to serve as a vicious henchman for U.S. imperialism's aggression in Asia and a rabid anti-China vanguard. The Sato government is the most reactionary and rabidly anti-China government among all post-war Japanese governments. It closely follows U.S. imperialism, colludes with the Soviet revisionists, and commits the most blatant anti-China acts that no previous Japanese government has dared to do.

	The Sato government's rampant anti-China stance is entirely in line with the needs of U.S. imperialism's policy of aggression and war. U.S. imperialism is being beaten to a pulp in Vietnam, in a state of utter disarray, unable to escape the dollar crisis, and facing unprecedented class struggle at home. The U.S. imperialism, beset by internal and external troubles, especially needs the Japanese reactionaries to play an "active role" in Asia to save it from its predicament. However, no matter how hard Sato and his ilk, the American lackeys, try, they will never be able to save the U.S. aggressors from their inevitable failure in Asia.

	Our great leader Chairman Mao pointed out: "The diehards always have a set of plans, which are about how to harm others for personal gain and how to play both sides. But all diehards in history have ended up with results opposite to their wishes. They always start by harming others and end up harming themselves."

	Sato and his ilk stubbornly adhere to the pro-American, anti-China policy and will definitely not end up well!

    佐藤反华决没有好下场
    本报评论员
      日本反动政府的头目佐藤荣作之流，最近接连就中日关系问题大放厥词。他们攻击中国，叫嚣“对同样是中国的国府和北京采取同样的原则”，公然制造“两个中国”；并且宣称日本政府在对华关系上，将“继续贯彻”臭名昭著的“政治、经济分离”的方针。这就再次表明，佐藤政府死心塌地追随美帝国主义、顽固地坚持敌视中国的政策。
    佐藤政府扬言，“为了改善整个日中关系”，中国方面“需要承认”“不干涉内政的原则”，这完全是贼喊捉贼、倒打一耙的无耻伎俩。事实明摆着，一贯粗暴地干涉中国内政，积极准备对中国发动侵略的，正是美帝国主义及其忠实走卒日本反动派。日本佐藤政府至今仍然同中国人民的公敌蒋匪帮密切勾结，大搞“两个中国”的阴谋；现在它放出台湾蒋匪帮“同样是中国”的谬论，更是放肆地向中国人民挑衅。它野心勃勃，妄图重新霸占我国领土台湾。佐藤政府不仅制订了一个又一个以中国为假想敌的军事进攻计划，而且还要强化矛头针对中国和亚洲各国人民的日美“安全条约”。佐藤政府明目张胆地干涉中国内政、猖狂反华的罪责是无法逃脱的。它企图对社会主义中国发动侵略战争的阴谋是掩盖不了的。
    佐藤之流一面高唱什么“要认真地努力扩大日中贸易”，同时又为扩大两国的贸易设置重重障碍，叫嚷要坚持“政治、经济分离”的方针。这是既要在政治上敌视中国，又想在经济上捞取实惠。可以正告佐藤政府，你们的这种如意算盘，是肯定要落空的。
    佐藤在猖狂反华的同时，竟然说什么他“不满足于日中关系的现状”，他是抱着“向前看的态度”，“希望日中关系有所改善”。真是装腔作势，虚伪透顶！佐藤政府的所作所为，完全是同“改善”中日关系背道而驰的。特别是从去年下半年以来，它采取了一系列疯狂敌视中国的严重步骤。佐藤自己窜到我国领土台湾进行阴谋活动，接着又“邀请”蒋匪帮头目“访日”，加紧同中国人民所唾弃的这具政治僵尸勾结。他遍访东南亚各国反动派，积极拼凑反华包围圈。他加紧同美帝国主义勾结，积极参加美帝国主义的矛头指向中国的亚洲战略体制，把日本变成美帝国主义向中国发动侵略的核战争基地。佐藤之流竟然说自己是“希望”“改善”中日关系的，不是活见鬼吗？
    事实充分证明，佐藤政府甘心充当美帝国主义侵略亚洲的一名凶恶的打手和猖狂反华的急先锋。佐藤政府是战后日本历届政府中最反动、最猖狂反华的政府。它紧紧追随美帝国主义，勾结苏修，干出了日本历届政府所不敢干的最露骨的反华勾当。
    佐藤政府猖狂反华，完全是适应美帝国主义侵略政策和战争政策的需要。美帝国主义在越南被打得头破血流，狼狈不堪，美元危机无法摆脱，国内阶级斗争空前激烈。处于内外交困的美帝国主义，特别需要日本反动派在亚洲起所谓“积极作用”，以解救它的困境。但是，不论佐藤之流的美国奴才怎样卖力，也绝对挽救不了美国侵略者在亚洲彻底失败的命运。
    我们伟大领袖毛主席指出：“顽固派，他们总有一套计划，其计划是如何损人利己以及如何装两面派之类。但是从来的顽固派，所得的结果，总是和他们的愿望相反。他们总是以损人开始，以害己告终。”
    佐藤之流顽固坚持亲美反华政策，决不会有什么好下场！
