The people's armed forces and civilians in the southern central region of South Vietnam continued to launch brave offensives against U.S. and puppet forces in March, achieving brilliant results.

According to statistics, the armed forces and civilians in the southern central region annihilated and captured more than 5,150 enemy personnel (including nearly 1,100 U.S. soldiers) during this period. In addition, thousands of puppet soldiers surrendered to the people. The armed forces and civilians in this region also leveled and forced the enemy to withdraw from 21 outposts and sentry posts, destroyed or damaged 56 enemy vehicles, 9 cannons, sank or damaged 33 enemy ships, shot down or damaged 28 enemy aircraft, and seized more than 300 pieces of various weapons and a large amount of military supplies.

In March, the armed forces and civilians in the southern central region launched successive attacks on enemy command headquarters in the cities of Binh Tuy, My Tho, Go Cong, and Cao Lanh, as well as nearly 20 puppet military districts in the provinces of Go Cong, Bien Hoa, and Binh Tuy. Many enemy targets were repeatedly attacked. The U.S. military base in the Phuoc Tuy province's Phuoc Dien area was subjected to four fierce assaults by the liberation army. The armed forces and civilians in Binh Tuy province launched seven attacks on the city of Binh Tuy over five days.

During this period, the guerrilla forces in the southern central region cooperated with the main forces of the liberation army to besiege the enemy in various cities and towns. The guerrilla forces and people in Binh Tuy province dug trenches and built fortifications around Binh Tuy city and other towns to besiege the enemy.

The armed forces and civilians in the southern central region also continuously struck the enemy on various water and land transportation lines, annihilating the enemy's fighting forces and causing the enemy's supply operations to come to a standstill.
