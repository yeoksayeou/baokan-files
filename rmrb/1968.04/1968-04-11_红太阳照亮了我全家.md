The Red Sun Illuminates My Entire Family

(I)

Last October, our great leader Chairman Mao issued the call to "Fight Selfishness and Criticize Revisionism" to the people of the entire nation. He also instructed us to establish study classes. Upon hearing this, the poor and lower-middle peasants of our brigade, with the help of the People's Liberation Army Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team, established Mao Zedong Thought study classes in both the brigade and production teams. My husband and second son attend these classes every evening. My second son is a sixth-grade student with a sharp mind. After studying for a few days, he identified a problem at home and proposed establishing a Mao Zedong Thought study class within our family.

One day, he brought up this issue. At that time, our family's opinions were not unified. My eldest daughter, Qiao Chunhua, enthusiastically supported the idea. My husband's thoughts were not clear. He muttered to himself, "If we establish a study class at home, I, as the father, will have to expose my selfishness and check myself in front of the children. If they criticize me, it will be embarrassing." He then said obliquely, "I am old and illiterate. Attending the brigade's study class every day is enough. Let your mother and sister study on their own." I also did not fully agree. I said, "I am an old woman of nearly fifty. I am always busy with cooking, grinding grain, and taking care of the children. What can I learn? In my opinion, you two should attend the brigade's study class."

When I said this, my second son immediately criticized me, "Establishing a Mao Zedong Thought study class is a matter of loyalty to Chairman Mao. You always say Chairman Mao is our family's savior. You should read Chairman Mao's books, listen to Chairman Mao's words, and act according to Chairman Mao's instructions. Why do you disagree when Chairman Mao tells us to establish study classes? This is hypocrisy." Oh dear! Not establishing a Mao Zedong Thought study class means being disloyal to Chairman Mao. I cannot accept this. I pointed at my second son and said, "You little kid, you don't know what you're talking about. You're putting a hat on your mother's head. I am from a poor peasant family. Before liberation, I shed more tears than you drank water. How can I be disloyal to Chairman Mao?" Seeing the situation deteriorating, my daughter quickly said, "That's enough. Let's discuss this later."

My second son was not discouraged. The next evening after dinner, he gathered the whole family to discuss the establishment of the study class again. This time, he started by making a self-criticism: "Yesterday, my attitude was rigid, and my methods were simple." Then, he explained the great significance of establishing Mao Zedong Thought study classes. Finally, he suddenly asked me, "Mother, how did you get your glasses?" This question touched on my old wound, and I couldn't help but think of a bitter episode from before liberation.

It was in 1947. Wolves were rampant, and our family could only farm a few acres of barren land. Not only did we not have enough to eat and wear, but the Kuomintang also conscripted soldiers everywhere. That year, my husband was already over the conscription age, but the landlords and rich peasants had money and power, and their sons did not have to go. They did not care about us poor people, whether we were over the conscription age or not. The first time they conscripted, my husband escaped, and the fake village chief took me to the village office and detained me, saying he would release me when my husband, Qiao Fengshi, returned. A few days later, the second conscription came, and my husband was hiding outside and did not return. Seeing that the person was not there, the fake village chief sealed our home and did not allow us to take anything. As a woman, how could I manage with children? There was nothing to eat or burn, and I cried all day. In this way, both from anger and fear, I developed "gas blindness," and I could not see anything. I had to be led when walking. It was the Communist Party and Chairman Mao who liberated us poor and lower-middle peasants from suffering. After liberation, our lives improved day by day. In 1964, I went to the Zhangjiakou Hospital for surgery, and my eyes were cured. I also got a pair of glasses. The evil old society made me blind, and Chairman Mao made me see the light again. Father and mother are not as dear as Chairman Mao, and the party's grace is greater than heaven and earth. Chairman Mao is truly our savior!

Thinking of this, I said to my second son, "I have told you this story many times. Why are you asking about this again today?" At this time, my daughter said, "Mother, the Communist Party and Chairman Mao saved our entire family, but China's Khrushchev is frantically opposing the party and Chairman Mao. Do you allow him to do so?" I said, "Whoever opposes Chairman Mao, I will fight to the death with him!" My second son then said, "Mother, you are right. Class enemies oppose Chairman Mao, and we must defend Chairman Mao to the death. We must study Chairman Mao's works better. Establishing a family Mao Zedong Thought study class is to better study and apply Chairman Mao's works, change our worldview, and follow Chairman Mao's revolution for life. Do you think the study class should be established or not?" With the children's guidance, my mind became clear, and I repeatedly said it should be established, it should be established!

After recalling the bitterness and sweetness, my husband's thoughts also became clear. Thus, our entire family began to establish the study class. We neatly hung Chairman Mao's portrait and quotations on the wall and set up a red bookstand, a self-criticism and anti-revisionism column, an evaluation column, and a learning reflection column. My second son was elected as the class leader, and my eldest daughter became the deputy leader and instructor. On December 10th last year, our family's Mao Zedong Thought study class was officially established.

(II)

How can a family Mao Zedong Thought study class be run well? Our experience is that we must focus on the four characters "Fight Selfishness and Criticize Revisionism." For the character "self," we must fight it constantly, at all times, and to the end. Only in this way can we fight for a "public" character and fight for a loyal heart towards Chairman Mao.

In January this year, our production team held an election for cadres. Before the election, I heard the villagers say that my husband, Qiao Fengshi, would be elected as the deputy team leader this year. When I heard this news, I was not at ease. My husband is a straightforward person who is not good at speaking. I was afraid that if he became a cadre, he would not be able to do a good job, and in the autumn, there would be nothing in the field. He would not be able to bear the responsibility. My husband also did not want to be a cadre. On the day he was elected as the deputy team leader, he returned home, and I said to him, "Quickly go and talk to the villagers again, saying that you cannot do it, and being elected is useless." My husband said, "The meeting has long been over, who do I talk to?" My eldest daughter also did not agree with him being a cadre. My second son, however, had different thoughts. He was happy to hear that his father had been elected as the deputy team leader and said, "The poor and lower-middle peasants have such trust in us. Father, you should do a good job!" He criticized us for being selfish. The next day, he first did ideological work on his sister, helping her repeatedly study the "Three Articles." Chairman Mao teaches us, "Our army is completely for the liberation of the people and is working wholeheartedly for the people's interests." Using Chairman Mao's teachings as a measure, my eldest daughter felt she was wrong. She said, "I did not want my father to be a cadre mainly because of selfishness, fearing that if my father became a cadre, he would be busy with collective affairs all day and would not take care of the family. Things like fetching water and grinding grain would all fall on me, and I would be tired. Others, like Zhang Zedong, sacrificed their lives for the revolutionary cause, but I am not even willing to do more housework. How far apart are we!" She immediately made a commitment to her brother that she would definitely not pull her father's legs.

That evening, our family study class discussed whether to let my husband be a cadre or not, using Chairman Mao's works. First, my second son organized the whole family to study Chairman Mao's teachings: "All revolutionary struggles in the world are for seizing power and consolidating power. 'Hard work is like a burden placed in front of us, see if we dare to bear it. The burden is light or heavy. Some people pick the light ones and avoid the heavy ones, pushing the heavy ones to others and picking the light ones for themselves. This is not a good attitude.' After studying Chairman Mao's quotations, my second son said, 'Electing cadres is not a small matter; it is a big issue about who holds power. Mother often tells us about your suffering before liberation. Why did we poor and lower-middle peasants suffer before liberation? Wasn't it because the power was not in our hands? Now we have stood up, and the landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists do not dare to bully us. Why? It is because the power is in the hands of us poor and lower-middle peasants. The villagers elected my father as a cadre, but my father hesitated and did not want to do it. Mother also pulled his legs from behind. This is forgetting our roots and not wanting to hold power for the proletariat. You think about it, is your thinking correct?' Chairman Mao's words are the truth. The more I study, the clearer my mind becomes. I did not want my husband to be a cadre because of selfishness. If we poor and lower-middle peasants do not hold power, do we want the landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists to hold power? At this time, I fiercely fought against my selfishness and said, 'My selfishness is serious. I am afraid my husband will offend people if he becomes a cadre, and for my own convenience, I do not even want the power. This is forgetting our roots and forgetting the great benefactor Chairman Mao. Pulling my husband's legs is disloyal to Chairman Mao. Studying the 'Three Articles' means using them. In the future, I will take care of the housework, and you should lead everyone to do the revolution well.' In this way, after a fierce struggle, our family's ideological problems were solved, and my husband happily took on the responsibility of deputy team leader the next day.

On the third evening, our family discussed how my husband could be a good cadre. After we all studied Chairman Mao's five conditions for a successor to the proletarian revolutionary cause, we all started talking, and we summarized four pieces of advice for my husband: The first is to be unconditionally loyal to Chairman Mao, to manage the Mao Zedong Thought study class well, and to always organize villagers to study Chairman Mao's works, using Mao Zedong Thought to arm the villagers' minds. The second is to manage our family's Mao Zedong Thought study class well, to establish a 'public' character, and to let my husband focus on collective affairs. The third is to always be the first to go to work and the last to leave, to do the heaviest work in the field, and to set an example in everything. The fourth is to consult with everyone on important matters, to listen to the opinions of the masses, and not to decide everything by himself. From then on, our entire family felt that my husband's responsibility was important, and the whole family was concerned about him being a cadre. This concern was about the big matter of holding the power.

(III)

Our family's Mao Zedong Thought study class has a rule that everyone must report their main activities, problems encountered, and thoughts of the day to the study class. Then, using the spirit of the "Three Articles," we support the right and criticize the wrong. Once, my husband returned from the field carrying soil, threw the basket and pole into the courtyard, and entered the house. He sat on the kang, puffing on his cigarette, and I guessed he might have encountered some trouble. Sure enough, after dinner and "Daily Reading," he was the first to speak, recounting a "bitterness," such as how difficult the work was and how the children did not follow the allocation, and he had a lot of complaints. It turned out that this day he allocated four children to dig soil. Because the ground was still a bit frozen, he also gave them a pickaxe. However, when it was time to finish work, the four children refused to carry the pickaxe back. My husband got angry and scolded the children. My husband thought that whoever used the tool should carry it back, and this was an old rule. Today's trouble was not his fault. However, as soon as he finished speaking, I criticized him a few words, and this made him angry. He shouted at me with a red neck, "I am scolded outside, and you still criticize me at home. I am like an owl perched on the wall, not saying good things inside or outside. You say, whoever used the tool should carry it back. What's wrong with that?" I was not weak either and said, "The children are young and weak. You asked them to carry a shovel and a pickaxe, and the road is far. Can they carry it? You are a big man and a deputy team leader. You can't even carry it back yourself, and you can't even bear this bit of hardship. Chairman Mao teaches us, 'All revolutionary comrades must care for, love, and help each other.' Where did you learn this?" My second son and daughter also criticized my husband. After the whole family criticized him, using the "Three Articles" as a measure, my husband admitted his mistake. From then on, he cared for others in his work and took the heavy burdens.

Another time, he led four villagers to spread manure. Other teams had finished work, but their work was not done. They wanted to do it the next day, but the remaining work was not worth sending more people. He and the four villagers studied a quotation from Chairman Mao: "Promote the spirit of daring to fight, not fearing sacrifice, not fearing fatigue, and continuous fighting (that is, fighting several battles in a short period without rest)." Everyone said they would definitely act according to Chairman Mao's teachings, finish the work, and then go home. They worked until it was almost dark before finishing the manure. He reported this to the study class, and using the "Three Articles" as a measure, the whole family unanimously agreed that he did the right thing and inserted a red flag in the commendation column for him.

Since our family established the Mao Zedong Thought study class, everyone reads revolutionary treasures and touches souls. We believe that selfishness is disloyalty to Chairman Mao, so no matter who it is, if something does not conform to the spirit of the "Three Articles," no matter how small, we will not let it go. We will dig out its roots and criticize it deeply. In this way, selfishness has no hiding place in our family, strongly promoting the revolutionization of people's thoughts, and everyone is eager to do good things for the collective. Especially my husband changed quickly, always thinking for the collective. One day, he had just fallen asleep when he heard that the team's chimney was on fire. He was so anxious that he did not even put on his socks, put on a pair of shoes, ran to the team, and climbed onto the roof. The livestock keeper below handed him water, and he poured it on the roof. It was very cold, and his feet were frozen and painful. He wanted to find someone to replace him, but he felt it did not conform to the spirit of the "Three Articles," so he insisted on extinguishing the fire before returning home. Because it was cold and he was not dressed properly, he caught a cold and had a high fever all over his body. We all advised him to rest for a day. He said, "With determination, not fearing sacrifice, overcoming all difficulties, and striving for victory." The next day, he went to work with the villagers again. In the evening, after dinner, he lay down and suddenly remembered that the team still had more than three thousand catties of radishes that were not covered, so he got up and covered the radishes alone. He often said to us, "No matter how small the collective's affairs are, they are big affairs. No matter how big one's own affairs are, they are small affairs."

Through establishing the Mao Zedong Thought study class, our entire family is always concerned about the collective. The villagers all say that our family has changed from the past. Recently, the brigade rated our family as a red family and selected me to attend the Zhangjiakou Region Conference of Active Learners of Mao Zedong Thought. We are determined to learn from the advanced units' experiences and turn our family into a bright red Mao Zedong Thought school.

    红太阳照亮了我全家
    河北省万全县旧堡公社旧堡大队社员　薛芝兰
    （一）
    去年十月份，我们伟大领袖毛主席向全国人民发出了“要斗私，批修”的伟大号召，还指示要办学习班。俺们大队的贫下中农闻风而动，在解放军毛泽东思想宣传队的帮助下，大队、生产队都办起了毛泽东思想学习班。我老汉、二小子每天晚上到队里学习。我二小子是小学六年级的学生，脑筋灵活，他学习了几天可就看出问题来了，说俺的家里有死角，思谋着要在家里办个毛泽东思想学习班。
    有一天，他把这个问题提了出来。当时，我们全家人的认识可不一致了。大女儿乔春花积极支持。我老汉的思想不大通，他心里嘀咕着：“家里办起学习班，当老子的在孩子们面前亮私呀，检查呀，闹不好他们还要批评你几句，面子上有多难看哪！”他就拐弯抹角地说：“我岁数大了，又不识字，队里办起学习班，我每天去参加就行了，叫你娘和你姐姐自己学吧！”我呢，也不大同意，我说：“我是个快五十岁的老婆子了，成天不是做饭、推碾子，就是哄孩子，能学出个啥来。依我看，你们爷儿俩参加队办学习班就行了。”我这么一说，我二小子可就冲着我放起炮来：“办不办毛泽东思想学习班，是忠不忠于毛主席的大事。你们整天说毛主席是咱家的救命恩人，要读毛主席的书，听毛主席的话，照毛主席的指示办事，为什么毛主席叫咱们办学习班，你们就不同意，这是口头革命派。”啊呀！不办毛泽东思想学习班就是不忠于毛主席，这我可接受不了。我就指着二小子说：“你小孩家说话不知南北，帽子扣到你娘头上来了。我贫农出身，解放前流的泪比你喝的水还多，我有啥不忠于毛主席的？”我女儿一见事情弄僵了，赶忙说：“算了，算了，以后再商量吧。”
    我二小子并不灰心，第二天吃了晚饭，又把全家叫到一块儿商量办学习班的事。这回，他先做检查：
  “昨天我态度生硬，方法简单。”接着，他就讲大办毛泽东思想学习班的伟大意义，最后，突然问我：“娘，你的眼镜是怎么来的？”这一句话可捅到我的老病上了，不由的使我想起解放前的一段心酸事。
    那是在一九四七年，豺狼当道，我们家只种了几亩乱沙地，除了吃不饱、穿不暖不说，国民党还到处抓兵。那年我老汉本来已经超过当兵的年龄了，可是，人家地主老财有钱有势，有儿子也不去，对咱们穷人，他那管你超过不超过年龄。第一次抓，我老汉跑了，伪保长把我叫到大乡里，扣起来，说多会儿我老汉乔丰时回来再放我。过了没几天，第二次抓兵，我老汉在外面躲着没回来，伪保长一见人不在，就把我们家给封了，什么东西也不让取。我一个妇道人家，拖儿带女的怎过呀，要吃的没吃的，要烧的没烧的，整天哭哭啼啼。就这样连气带吓，我得了“气蒙眼”，什么也看不见了，走路还得叫人领着。是共产党、毛主席把我们贫下中农从苦难中解放出来，解放后生活一天天好起来。一九六四年，我到张家口医院动手术，治好了眼睛，还配了一副眼镜。万恶的旧社会使我双目失明，毛主席又使我重见了光明。爹亲娘亲不如毛主席亲，天大地大不如党的恩情大，毛主席真是咱们的救命恩人哪！
    我想到这儿，对二小子说：“这件事娘给你们讲了多少次了，你怎么今天又问起这个来了？”这时，我女儿说：“娘，共产党、毛主席救了咱们全家，可是，中国赫鲁晓夫却疯狂地反党反毛主席，你说咱们让不让他？”我说：“谁反对毛主席我就和他拚！”我二小子就接上茬说：“娘，说的对，阶级敌人反对毛主席，咱们就要誓死保卫毛主席，要更好地学习毛主席著作。咱们办家庭毛泽东思想学习班，就是为了更好地活学活用毛主席著作，改造世界观，紧跟毛主席干一辈子革命。你说学习班该办不该办？”两个孩子这么一开导，我心里豁然开朗了，连说该办，该办！
    经过忆苦思甜，我老汉的思想也通了。于是，我们全家人就动手办学习班。我们把毛主席像、毛主席语录，端端正正地贴在墙上，又建立了红书台、斗私批修栏、评比栏、学习心得栏。二小子被全家人选成学习班的组长，大女儿当了副组长兼辅导员。去年十二月十日，我们家的家庭毛泽东思想学习班正式办起来了。（二）
    家庭毛泽东思想学习班，怎样才能办好呢？我们的体会是，必须在“斗私，批修”这四个字上狠下功夫。对“私”字，要经常地斗，时时地斗，一斗到底，这样才能斗出一个“公”字来，才能斗出对毛主席的一片赤胆忠心来。
    今年一月份，我们生产队选举干部。选举之前，我就听社员们说，今年要选我老汉乔丰时当生产队的副队长。一听到这个音信，我心里就不安然。我老汉是个不会说不会道的直性子人，我怕他当了干部，做不好工作，到秋天场里没东西，那可担不起责任。我老汉也不愿当干部。选上他当副队长的那天，他回到家里，我就对他说：“快去和社员们再说一说，就说你干不了，选上也是白选。”我老汉说：“会早就散了，找谁说呢？”我大女儿也不赞同他当干部。我二小子可与我们的想法不同，他听说父亲被选上副队长，心里可高兴了，说：“贫下中农这样信得过咱们，爹就好好地干吧！”他批评了我们都是“私”字当头。第二天，他首先做他姐姐的思想工作，帮助她反复学习“老三篇”。毛主席教导我们说：“我们这个队伍完全是为着解放人民的，是彻底地为人民的利益工作的。”用毛主席的教导一衡量，我大女儿觉得自己错了。她说：“我不愿叫爹当干部，主要是‘私’字作怪，怕爹当了干部，整天忙集体的事，顾不上家里，什么担水呀，推碾子呀，都落在我头上了，受累。人家张思德为了革命的利益，牺牲了自己的生命，我多做点家务活都不愿意，这差到那里去了！”她当下向她兄弟下了保证，坚决不拉她爹的后腿。
    当天晚上，我们家庭学习班带着让不让我老汉当干部的问题，活学活用毛主席著作。首先，二小子组织全家人学习了毛主席的教导：“世界上一切革命斗争都是为着夺取政权，巩固政权。”“艰苦的工作就象担子，摆在我们的面前，看我们敢不敢承担。担子有轻有重。有的人拈轻怕重，把重担子推给人家，自己拣轻的挑。这就不是好的态度。”学完了毛主席语录，我二小子说：“选举干部可不是一件小事，是关系到什么人掌权的大问题，娘经常给我们讲你解放前受罪，为什么咱们贫下中农在解放前受罪呢？还不是因为刀把子不在咱们手里。现在咱们翻了身，地、富、反、坏、右不敢再欺负我们，因为啥？就是因为刀把子在咱贫下中农手里。社员们选我爹当干部，我爹推推脱脱不干，娘也在后面拉后腿，这就是忘本，就是不想为无产阶级掌权。你们对照着毛主席的教导想一想，你们的思想对头吗？”毛主席的话是真理，越学我心里越亮堂。我不愿意让我老汉当干部就是“私”字作怪。咱们贫下中农不掌权难道还能叫地、富、反、坏、右掌权？这时，我狠斗自己的“私”字，我说：“我的私心严重，怕你爹当干部得罪人，为了自己少惹事省心，连刀把子也不要了，这是忘本，是喝水忘了打井人，忘了大恩人毛主席。拉你爹的后腿，就是对毛主席的不忠。学了‘老三篇’就要用，今后家务事有我在，你就好好领着大家干革命吧。”就这样，经过一场激烈的斗争，我们全家人的思想问题解决了，我老汉第二天就高高兴兴地担起了副队长的担子。
    第三天晚上，我们全家人讨论他爹怎样才能当好干部。我们全家人学完毛主席关于无产阶级革命事业接班人的五项条件后，就你一句我一句的说开了，综合起来共给我老汉提了四条意见：第一条是对毛主席无限忠诚，要抓好毛泽东思想学习班，时时注意组织社员学习毛主席著作，用毛泽东思想武装社员的头脑。第二条是办好俺们家的毛泽东思想学习班，树立起一个“公”字，家务事有我和大女儿照管，老汉一心一意地为集体操心。第三条是每天出勤要走在社员前头，收工走在社员后头，到地里什么活重干什么，处处做出个样子来。第四条是有事多和大伙商量，多听群众意见，不要由自个说了算。从此以后，我们全家人都感到老汉肩上的担子重要，全家人为他一人当干部操心，这心操的是掌好刀把子的大事。（三）
    我们家的毛泽东思想学习班有这样一条规定，每天不管谁都要把自己一天的主要活动，遇到的问题，自己的思想，向学习班汇报一次，然后用“老三篇”的精神来衡量，对的全家就支持，不对的就批评。有一次，老汉从地里担土回来，把箩头扁担往院里一扔就进了家，坐在炕上，吧哒吧哒地直抽烟，我估摸着他可能又碰了钉子。果然，吃了晚饭，“天天读”完了后，他第一个发言，叙了一段“苦”，什么工作难做呀，小孩们不服从分配呀，怨气一大堆。原来是这么回事，这天他分配四个小孩铲土，因为地还有点冻，就又叫他们拿了一把镐，可是收工的时候，这四个小孩说什么也不扛这把镐，老汉火了，把孩子们训了一顿。老汉满以为谁用的工具谁拿，这是长年来的老规矩，今天这场风浪怨不着他。不料他刚一说完，我就批评了他几句，这下可把他给说翻了，冲着我红着脖子直嚷：“在外面受别人的气，回来你们还要批评，我这是猫头鹰落在边墙上，口里口外不说好。你说，谁用的工具谁往回拿，有什么错？”我也不示弱，说：“孩子们岁数小，力薄，你叫他们拿铁锹又拿镐，路儿挺远，他们拿动了？你挺大的人，又是副队长，不会自己扛回来，就连这点苦也吃不了。毛主席教导我们‘一切革命队伍的人都要互相关心，互相爱护，互相帮助。’你学到那里去了？”我二小子、女儿也都批评他爹。经全家人这么一批评，用“老三篇”一对照，老汉认了错，从此以后，他在劳动中处处关心别人，拣重担子挑。
    还有一次，他带着四个社员起粪，别的队收工了，他们的活还没做完，有心明天再干，剩下的活不多，又不值得再派人，他就和四个社员一起学习了毛主席的一条语录：“发扬勇敢战斗、不怕牺牲、不怕疲劳和连续作战（即在短期内不休息地接连打几仗）的作风。”大家都说坚决按照毛主席的教导办事，收拾完再收工，一直干到天快黑了才把粪起完。他向学习班汇报了这件事，用“老三篇”一对照，全家人一致认为做对了，给他在表扬栏上插了红旗。
    我们家自从办起了毛泽东思想学习班，人人读革命宝书，人人触灵魂。我们认为，“私”字当头，就是对毛主席不忠，所以全家人不管是谁，凡是不符合“老三篇”精神的事，那怕是再小再小也不放过，总要把它的根子挖出来，批深批臭。这样，就使“私”字在我们家没有藏身之地，有力地促进了人的思想革命化，全家人都争着为集体办好事。尤其是我老汉转变得可快了，处处为集体着想。有一天，他刚睡下，听说队房的烟囱着火了，着急的连袜子也没顾上穿，穿了双鞋，跑到队里，一翻身上了房，下面饲养员给他送水，他在房上泼，天很冷，两脚冻得发疼，他想找个人换一下，但觉得不符合“老三篇”的精神，就一直坚持把火泼灭才回了家。由于天冷，没穿好衣服，他感冒了，浑身发烧，我们都劝他休息一天。他说：“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利。”第二天，又和社员们一起下地了。晚上，吃了晚饭刚躺下，他又想起队里还有三千多斤胡萝卜没有盖好，又爬起来一个人去盖胡萝卜。他经常对我们说：“集体的事再小也是大事，自己的事再大也是小事。”
    我们家通过办毛泽东思想学习班，全家人处处为集体操心，社员们都说我们家变的和过去不一样了。最近，大队把我们家评为全家红，推选我出席了张家口地区学习毛泽东思想积极分子代表大会。我们决心学习先进单位的经验，把家庭办成红彤彤的毛泽东思想大学校。
