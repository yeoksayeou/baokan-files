The poor and lower-middle peasants of Donggou County, with the help of the military agricultural assistance team, have seriously studied the works of Chairman Mao, overcome blind optimism and complacency, and built more than 250 medium and small water conservancy projects. The masses have extensively repaired and built terraced fields, leveling 37,000 mu of land.

Our reporter reports: The poor and lower-middle peasants, militiamen, and revolutionary cadres of Donggou County in Liaoning Province, with the help of the local garrison, have firmly remembered Chairman Mao's teachings that "water conservancy is the lifeline of agriculture." Based on the fact that there has been little rain and snow since last winter and this spring, and there is a possibility of spring drought, they have overcome blind optimism and complacency, and have relied on their own efforts to carry out extensive water conservancy construction in agricultural fields, striving for bumper harvests despite drought or flood.

Donggou County originally had good water conservancy conditions. The central plain area has already built a water network, and more than 600,000 mu of paddy fields can basically guarantee bumper harvests despite drought or flood. In the face of good water conservancy conditions and more water stored in the reservoirs last summer, some people have an insufficient understanding of the severity of this year's drought, leading to blind optimism and complacency, and relaxing the preparations for drought prevention and resistance. Some people say: "This year, the reservoir has so much water. Even if it doesn't rain all spring, there won't be a problem. A bumper harvest is guaranteed." The military agricultural assistance team and the county's first-line command group believe that in the face of the emergence of drought, if we do not overcome this blind optimism and complacency, we cannot implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions to "grasp revolution and promote production, work, and preparedness." Therefore, we must first build a "channel" for drought prevention and resistance in our minds, and then strive to improve the level of water conservancy construction.

With the help of the military agricultural assistance team, the poor and lower-middle peasants, militiamen, and revolutionary cadres have repeatedly studied Chairman Mao's teachings that "advantage without preparation is not a true advantage, and there is no initiative" in the Mao Zedong Thought study classes. They have seriously analyzed the situation of agricultural production this year. Although the reservoirs have more water this year, the lack of rain and snow since last winter and this spring has made the land dry and the soil moisture poor, and the water demand for paddy fields will be much greater than in previous years. Everyone realized that if they think that good water conservancy conditions mean complacency, this advantage could turn into a disadvantage. Only by paying attention to the drought "enemy" in our minds can we fully utilize the favorable conditions and be prepared for any eventuality. Armed with Mao Zedong Thought, the poor and lower-middle peasants, militiamen, and revolutionary cadres have heightened their enthusiasm for drought prevention and resistance. They took Dazhai as an example, identified gaps, and made plans. A mass water conservancy construction movement quickly formed.

In the central and southern communes with relatively good water conservancy conditions, they conducted a comprehensive inspection of all past water conservancy projects. According to high standards and quality requirements, they mobilized more than ten thousand laborers to brave the wind and snow, and carried out maintenance, expansion, and renovation. They extensively built water conservancy supporting facilities, and at the same time raised and thickened the channels built in recent years to prevent water leakage and enhance drought prevention and resistance capabilities. The poor and lower-middle peasants said: Only high standards in our minds can lead to high standards in water conservancy construction. If we are complacent in our minds, the drought "enemy" will become rampant.

The poor and lower-middle peasants in the mountainous areas, in the past year and a half of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, severely criticized the black goods of water conservancy construction advocated by the handful of capitalist roaders within the Party. They carried forward the revolutionary spirit of Dazhai and built water conservancy projects on their own. The Tangchi Commune, which is in a semi-mountainous area, has relied on natural water for irrigation of paddy fields for many years and cannot guarantee bumper harvests despite drought or flood. This year, they decided to build a 10-li-long main canal to draw water from the river for irrigation. The communes of Xiangyang and Xinnong, which have always thought they had no conditions to build water conservancy projects, also built a number of small water conservancy projects this year, turning some of the land at the foot of the mountains into paddy fields.

Currently, more than 250 medium and small water conservancy projects that have been self-reliantly repaired, expanded, renovated, and newly built throughout the county have completed more than 130 projects. To save water, the county has also mobilized more than ten thousand members to extensively repair and build terraced fields like Dazhai, and has leveled 37,000 mu of land.

    优势而无准备不是真正优势  水利条件较好也要注意防旱
    东沟县自力更生大搞农田水利建设
    贫下中农在解放军支农部队帮助下，认真学习毛主席著作，克服盲目乐观、麻痹大意思想，修建二百五十多处中小型水利工程。广大社员大修大寨田，平整土地三万七千多亩
    本报讯　辽宁省东沟县广大贫下中农、民兵和革命干部，在当地驻军的帮助下，牢记毛主席关于“水利是农业的命脉”的教导，根据去冬今春雨雪稀少，有发生春旱可能的情况，克服盲目乐观、麻痹大意的思想，自力更生地大搞农田水利建设，争取旱涝保丰收。
    东沟县原来的水利条件较好，中部平原地区已经建成了水利网，有六十多万亩水田基本上能够旱涝保收。在水利条件好，去年夏天水库里又多蓄了一些水的情况下，部分人对今年旱象的严重性认识不足，产生了盲目乐观、麻痹大意的思想，放松了防旱和抗旱的准备工作。有人说：“今年库里有那么多水，一春不下雨也没有问题，丰收算拿定了。”驻军支农部队和县第一线指挥部领导小组认为，在旱象露头的情况下，不克服这种盲目乐观、麻痹大意的思想，就不能落实毛主席“要抓革命促生产，促工作，促战备”的最新指示，切实做到旱涝保收。因此必须在思想上先筑起一道防旱抗旱的“渠道”，再接再厉把水利化程度提高一步。
    在支农部队帮助下，广大贫下中农、民兵和革命干部，在毛泽东思想学习班里，反复学习毛主席“优势而无准备，不是真正的优势，也没有主动”的教导，认真分析了今年农业生产形势。今年虽然水库蓄水较多，但是去冬今春雨雪稀少，土地干旱，墒情不好，水田用水量要比往年大量增加。大家认识到如果认为水利条件好就麻痹大意，这就可能使优势变为劣势；只有从思想上重视旱象这个“敌人”，才能充分发挥有利条件，做到有备无患。在毛泽东思想的武装下，广大贫下中农、民兵和革命干部，提高了防旱抗旱积极性。他们以大寨为榜样，大找差距，大订措施，一个群众性水利建设运动迅速形成。
    水利条件比较好的中部、南部各公社，对过去所有的水利工程进行了一次大检查，按照高标准、高质量的要求，出动上万名劳动力，冒着风雪严寒，进行维修、扩建和改修，大搞水利配套，同时对近几年新修的渠道，加高培厚，防止漏水，增强抗旱防旱能力。广大贫下中农说：只有思想上的高标准，才能有水利化上的高标准。思想麻痹一分，旱象这个“敌人”就猖狂十分。
    山区广大贫下中农在一年多来的无产阶级文化大革命中，狠批了党内最大一小撮走资派在水利建设上所宣扬的贪大求洋的黑货。他们发扬大寨的革命精神，自力更生修水利。处于半山区的汤池公社，多年来只靠天然水灌溉水田，不能旱涝保收；今年他们决心修一条十华里长的大干渠，抽江水灌田。一向认为没有条件修水利的向阳、新农等公社，今年也都修建一批小型水利工程，把一部分山根子地也都改成水田。
    目前，全县自力更生维修、扩建、改建和新修的二百五十多处中小型水利工程，已完成了一百三十多处。为了节约用水，全县还出动了上万名社员大修大寨田，大搞条田化，现已平整土地三万七千多亩。　（东武通）
