Chairman Mao's latest instructions have been swiftly transformed into mass action. The Jiangxi Paper Mill has excelled in both revolution and production.

Their experience is as follows: The members of the revolutionary committee have conveyed and implemented Chairman Mao's latest instructions to the masses with the greatest enthusiasm, always focusing on the class struggle, playing the role of core leaders among revolutionary cadres, checking weak links, and summarizing advanced experiences.

According to Xinhua News Agency, the Jiangxi Paper Mill Revolutionary Committee has seriously implemented Chairman Mao's latest instructions, fully mobilized and utilized the enthusiasm of revolutionary workers, and excelled in both revolution and production. It has become a banner for learning and implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions on the industrial front in the entire province. Recently, the Jiangxi Provincial Revolutionary Committee held a conference in Nanchang for industrial and commercial enterprises and public institutions, as well as a mass rally of workers, to introduce their experiences and call on the entire province's industrial front to launch a "Learn from Jiang Paper, Catch Up with Jiang Paper" campaign of learning, emulation, and mutual aid to further implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions and launch a new wave of revolutionary and productive efforts.

Since its establishment in November last year, the Jiangxi Paper Mill Revolutionary Committee has organized everyone to repeatedly study and deeply understand Chairman Mao's series of latest instructions based on the problems in their work. This has helped everyone further realize that Chairman Mao's latest instructions are the most powerful ideological weapon to ensure the complete victory of the Cultural Revolution. The fundamental task of the revolutionary committee is to actively learn and apply Mao Zedong Thought, ensuring that Chairman Mao's various latest instructions can be conveyed as quickly and accurately as possible, transforming Chairman Mao's latest instructions into the conscious actions of the masses and pushing the Cultural Revolution forward.

After studying, the members of the revolutionary committee have significantly increased their awareness of learning, implementing, propagating, and defending Chairman Mao's latest instructions, and have greatly strengthened their sense of party policy.

The Jiangxi Paper Mill Revolutionary Committee requires each member to become a model in learning, implementing, propagating, and defending Chairman Mao's latest instructions, conveying and implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions with the greatest enthusiasm, a swift and decisive style, and a serious attitude. The mill's revolutionary committee has taken the following effective measures to ensure that workers understand and grasp Chairman Mao's latest instructions: First, organize workers to study Mao Zedong Thought in classes at the mill or workshop level; second, twenty-seven of the twenty-seven committee members have not left their production posts, and seven full-time standing committee members spend most of their time in workshops and teams, directly propagating Chairman Mao's latest instructions to the workers; third, use broadcasts, small newspapers, and blackboard newspapers for extensive propaganda; fourth, combine large and small meetings, hold workers' meetings to convey the instructions word for word, and organize workers' discussion meetings to deeply discuss and understand the spirit; fifth, launch "one helps one, one pairs with one" activities, organizing workers to spread and study Chairman Mao's latest instructions together. When Chairman Mao's instruction to "save and make revolution" came, the mill's revolutionary committee immediately conveyed and widely propagated it, making it known to every household and person.

Fully utilizing the role of revolutionary cadres is an important experience of the Jiangxi Paper Mill Revolutionary Committee in implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions. After the former mill party secretary, former director, and another mid-level cadre joined the revolution's three-in-one combination, they respectively took on the roles of committee chairman and standing committee members. In their daily work, new cadres humbly learn from them. The old cadres also actively and enthusiastically help new cadres improve their policy level. For example, after the revolutionary committee was established, someone proposed to remove all workshop production team leaders who had taken the wrong side during the initial stage of the movement. These revolutionary cadres promptly pointed out that this did not conform to Chairman Mao's policy on correctly handling cadres. Production team leaders are mostly old workers, class brothers, and key production forces. They should be united and helped to correct their mistakes and return to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line.

In implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions, the Jiangxi Paper Mill Revolutionary Committee often checks weak links and timely summarizes advanced experiences. The pulp workshop seriously implemented Chairman Mao's instructions on correctly handling cadres, combining a cadre who had a good understanding and corrected his mistakes to become the leader of the leading group, and combining a deceived mass who had a good transformation to participate in the leading group. The mill's revolutionary committee promptly summarized and promoted this experience, promoting the rapid and good establishment of grassroots leading groups throughout the mill. In February, after the mill's revolutionary committee held a political work meeting on fully implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions, it mobilized the entire mill's cadres and masses to conduct a comprehensive summary and inspection of the implementation of Chairman Mao's latest instructions and the party's policies, making the broad revolutionary workers not only see the great achievements made in implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions, greatly inspiring their fighting spirit and confidence, but also finding the gaps, discovering weak links, seeing the direction for further progress, and overcoming the arrogance and complacency of a few comrades.

In implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions, the Jiangxi Paper Mill Revolutionary Committee has focused on the class struggle between the two classes, the two roads, and the two lines. On the one hand, they organize cadres and masses to seriously study Chairman Mao's teachings on class and class struggle, and on the other hand, they inform the broad revolutionary masses of the class struggle trends in society and within the mill at any time, reminding everyone not to forget class struggle. Whether the class enemies disrupt the implementation of Chairman Mao's latest instructions from the right or the extreme "left," the mill's revolutionary committee promptly mobilizes the broad revolutionary workers to expose and criticize them, exposing the class enemies hiding in dark corners and causing trouble. This has raised the class consciousness of the broad revolutionary masses and ensured the implementation of Chairman Mao's latest instructions.

With the gradual implementation of Chairman Mao's series of latest instructions, the revolution and production of the Jiangxi Paper Mill have shown a very good situation and are getting better and better. At present, more than 80% of the cadres in the entire mill have come forward and bravely shouldered the dual burdens of revolution and production. Revolutionary three-in-one leading groups have been established in all grassroots units. The broad masses of the entire mill are closely united around the revolutionary committee, spiritedly striving to be pioneers in revolution and models in production. They say: "The paper we produce is used to print Chairman Mao's revolutionary classics and propagate Mao Zedong Thought. We must overcome all difficulties and resolutely complete the production tasks." Since this year, the mill's production has been on the rise, and in March, the total paper output of the entire mill exceeded the sum of the output of January and February.

    毛主席最新指示迅速变成群众行动
    江西造纸厂革命和生产搞得很出色
    他们的经验是：革委会成员以最大的热情向群众传达、落实毛主席最新指示，始终抓住阶级斗争的纲，发挥革命领导干部的骨干作用，检查薄弱环节，总结先进经验
    据新华社南昌十三日电　江西造纸厂革命委员会认真落实毛主席的最新指示，充分调动和发挥革命职工的积极性，把革命和生产搞得很出色，成为全省工业战线上学习和执行毛主席最新指示的一面旗帜。江西省革命委员会最近先后召开南昌地区工交企业、事业单位现场会和职工群众大会，介绍了他们的经验，并号召全省工业战线开展“学江纸、赶江纸”的比学赶帮活动，推动全省工业战线进一步落实毛主席的最新指示，掀起抓革命、促生产的新高潮。
    江西造纸厂革命委员会自去年十一月成立后，根据工作中存在的问题，组织大家反复学习、深刻领会毛主席的一系列最新指示，使大家进一步认识到，毛主席的最新指示是保证无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的最强大思想武器；革委会的根本任务，就是要活学活用、学好用好毛泽东思想，保证毛主席的各项最新指示能够最迅速最准确地传达下去，使毛主席的最新指示迅速化为群众的自觉行动，推动无产阶级文化大革命运动滚滚向前。经过学习，革委会成员大大提高了学习、执行、宣传、捍卫毛主席最新指示的自觉性，大大增强了党的政策观念。
    江西造纸厂革委会要求每个成员都要成为学习、执行、宣传、捍卫毛主席最新指示的模范，以最大的热情、雷厉风行的作风和严肃的态度来传达、落实毛主席的最新指示。厂革委会为使职工群众及时了解并掌握毛主席的最新指示，还采取了这样一些有效措施：一、以全厂或班组为单位，举办毛泽东思想学习班，组织职工群众进行专题学习；二、革委会二十七个委员大都没有脱离车间生产岗位，七个脱产的常委也大部分时间在车间班组，他们直接向职工群众宣传毛主席的最新指示；三、利用广播、小报、黑板报广泛进行宣传；四、大会小会相结合，召开职工大会原原本本地传达，组织职工座谈会深入讨论和深刻领会精神；五、开展“一帮一、一对红”活动，组织职工互相传播、共同学习毛主席的最新指示。毛主席的“要节约闹革命”的最新指示传来，厂革委会立即传达，大力进行宣传，做到了家喻户晓，人人皆知。
    充分发挥革命领导干部的骨干作用，是江西造纸厂革命委员会落实毛主席最新指示的一条重要经验。前厂党委书记、前厂长和另一个中层干部参加了革命的三结合，分别担任革委会主任和常委等领导职务后，革委会作决定、定措施、处理问题，都充分听取他们的意见，让他们发挥骨干作用。在日常工作中，新干部虚心向他们学习。老干部也能主动热情地帮助新干部提高政策水平。如革委会成立后，有人提出要把运动初期站错队的各车间的生产班组长一律撤换。这几个革命领导干部及时指出：这样做不符合毛主席关于正确对待干部的政策。生产班组长大都是老工人，是阶级兄弟，又是生产中的骨干力量，应该团结他们，热情地帮助他们改正错误，回到毛主席的革命路线上来。
    江西造纸厂革委会在落实毛主席的最新指示中，还经常检查薄弱环节，及时总结先进经验。机浆车间认真执行毛主席关于正确对待干部的最新指示，结合了一个认识和改正错误较好的干部当领导班子的第一把手，结合了一个转变很好的受蒙蔽群众参加领导班子。厂革委会及时总结、推广了这一经验，促进了全厂基层领导班子又快又好地建立起来。二月份，厂革委会在召开了全厂全面落实毛主席的最新指示的政治工作会议以后，又发动全厂干部、群众对落实毛主席最新指示和党的方针政策进行一次大总结、大检查，使广大革命职工不仅看到了落实毛主席最新指示所取得的巨大成绩，极大地鼓舞了斗志，增强了信心，同时，又找出了差距，发现了薄弱环节，看到了继续前进的方向，克服了少数同志中的骄傲自满情绪。
    江西造纸厂革委会在落实毛主席最新指示的过程中，抓住了两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线斗争这一个纲。他们一方面组织干部和群众认真学习毛主席关于阶级和阶级斗争的教导，一方面随时把社会上和厂内阶级斗争的动向告诉广大革命群众，提醒大家“千万不要忘记阶级斗争”。阶级敌人无论是从右的或极“左”的方面来破坏落实毛主席的最新指示，厂革委会都及时发动广大革命职工进行揭露批判，把躲在阴暗角落里煽阴风、搞破坏的阶级敌人揪出来。提高了广大革命群众的阶级觉悟，保障了毛主席最新指示的落实。
    随着毛主席一系列最新指示的逐步落实，江西造纸厂的革命和生产呈现一片大好形势，而且越来越好。目前，全厂百分之八十以上的干部已经站出来，勇敢地挑起了革命和生产两副重担。各基层单位都建立了革命三结合的领导班子。全厂广大群众紧紧团结在革委会的周围，精神焕发地争当抓革命的闯将，促生产的模范。他们说：“我们生产的纸是用来印制毛主席的革命宝书、宣传毛泽东思想的，我们一定要克服各种困难，坚决完成生产任务。”今年以来，这个厂的生产直线上升，三月份全厂纸张总产量又超过了一、二月份产量的总和。
