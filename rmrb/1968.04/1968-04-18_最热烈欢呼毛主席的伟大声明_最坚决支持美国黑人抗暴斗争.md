The entire nation's hundreds of millions of military personnel and civilians unanimously believe that Chairman Mao's declaration supporting the American black people's struggle against violence points out the direction of victory to the revolutionary people of the world, greatly boosts the morale of the world's revolutionary people, and greatly dampens the arrogance of imperialism, modern revisionism, and the reactionaries of various countries. It will certainly inspire all the oppressed peoples and oppressed nations of the world to bravely fight for a complete liberation! The 700 million Chinese people resolutely respond to Chairman Mao's battle call, vowing to be the strong backbone of the American black brothers and all the oppressed peoples and oppressed nations of the world, and together with the revolutionary people of the world, launch a sustained and fierce attack on U.S. imperialism and its accomplices.

According to a Xinhua News Agency report dated the 17th, the hundreds of millions of revolutionary people of the entire nation, with boundless loyalty to the great leader Chairman Mao and strong proletarian internationalist sentiments, most enthusiastically support Chairman Mao's great declaration supporting the American black people's struggle against violence. Revolutionary masses across the country have expressed that the 700 million Chinese people, who are currently seizing a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, most resolutely respond to the battle call of the great commander Chairman Mao. They are determined to unite more closely with the workers, peasants, revolutionary intellectuals, and all those who oppose U.S. imperialism from all countries, take action, support the American black people's struggle against violence, and launch a sustained and fierce attack on the common enemy of the people of the world, U.S. imperialism, and its accomplices.

The great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "The people who have already won revolutionary victories should aid the people who are still struggling for liberation. This is our internationalist duty." Under the nurturing of the great thought of Mao Zedong, the revolutionary people of various places in our country, after hearing Chairman Mao's great declaration on the radio last night, enthusiastically cheered, spread the news, and thousands upon thousands of people took to the streets at night to parade and post slogans. Today, many cities across the country held grand rallies with tens of thousands to hundreds of thousands of participants, and held powerful demonstrations to express their most resolute support for Chairman Mao's great declaration.

Revolutionary masses emphasized that in this new era where the world has raised the great banner of Mao Zedong Thought, and in the face of a great situation both internationally and domestically, the great declaration of the great teacher of the proletariat, Chairman Mao, which has great historical significance, is the greatest support and encouragement for the American black brothers and all the oppressed peoples and oppressed nations of the world who are in the midst of struggle. It is a new battle mobilization order calling on the revolutionary people of the world to attack the common enemy, U.S. imperialism, and its accomplices. It is a spiritually powerful atomic bomb that will thoroughly smash colonialism, imperialism, and all exploitative systems. Chairman Mao's declaration points out the direction of victory to the revolutionary people of the world, greatly boosts the morale of the world's revolutionary people, and greatly dampens the arrogance of imperialism, modern revisionism, and the reactionaries of various countries. It will certainly inspire all the oppressed peoples and oppressed nations of the world to bravely fight for a complete liberation!

In our great motherland's capital, Beijing, last night there were already one parade after another. The streets were filled with huge slogans supporting Chairman Mao's great declaration. Today, from morning to evening, the city was in an uproar, with parades continuing one after another. The slogan "Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years!" echoed through the sky. The workers, poor and lower-middle peasants, and Red Guards of the capital expressed their resolute support for Chairman Mao's great declaration and resolute response to Chairman Mao's battle call, vowing to be the strong backbone of the American black brothers and all the oppressed peoples of the world. The railway workers of the capital shouted, "The East is Red, sung across the four seas, respected around the five continents. Chairman Mao is forever in the hearts of the oppressed and exploited people of the world. We workers, with our boundless loyalty to Chairman Mao, will forever be promoters of world revolution and strive for the liberation of all humanity and the realization of communism for our entire lives." The revolutionary workers of the Beijing Knitting Factory and the support-left personnel of the 8341st Unit held a rally and parade. They pointed out that Chairman Mao's declaration expresses the revolutionary will of the 700 million Chinese people and is a battle call to all oppressed peoples and oppressed nations to rise up and rebel against the U.S. and its accomplices. We will resolutely carry out Chairman Mao's words. The poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres in the suburbs resolutely expressed that where Chairman Mao supports, I support; where Chairman Mao waves his hand, I advance. We are loyal to Chairman Mao and must stand firmly in our county and district, with our eyes on the world, resolutely carry out the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution according to Chairman Mao's instructions, and better support the revolution of the American black people and the people of the world. The Red Guards of the capital held a large-scale parade, proudly saying, "Against the U.S., against the revisionists, against all reactionaries, we will not be lenient, and we will attack! Attack! Attack!"

In Shanghai, with its glorious tradition of anti-imperialist struggle, a powerful wave of supporting the American black people's struggle against violence has surged. Revolutionary masses from all fronts in the city have held rallies and, despite the heavy rain, taken to the streets to parade, resolutely supporting Chairman Mao's great declaration. In the central area of the city, along the Bund and Nanjing Road, revolutionary masses formed a surging tide, and their slogans shook the banks of the Huangpu River. Many dock workers denounced the heinous crimes of U.S. imperialism's occupation of the Shanghai port and its collusion with the Kuomintang reactionaries, who ruthlessly exploited and oppressed the Shanghai workers before liberation. They said, "Under the leadership of the great leader Chairman Mao, we, the working class, have waged a long, unyielding, and heroic struggle against domestic and foreign reactionaries, using the gun to drive the American devils out of the Chinese mainland. The U.S. imperialists' bloody suppression of the American black people makes the American black brothers increasingly realize that violent revolution is the only way to liberation. We Shanghai workers will forever support the just struggle of the American black people and the revolutionary people of various countries until we completely smash U.S. imperialism and all evil exploitative systems." The workers of the Shanghai No. 3 Steel Plant said, "We firmly believe that with the widespread dissemination of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought and their combination with the revolutionary struggles of various countries, the oppressed peoples and oppressed nations of the world will certainly completely defeat U.S. imperialism and all its accomplices and achieve a complete liberation." The broad masses of the Shanghai Workers' Revolutionary Rebel Headquarters expressed that they would definitely, together with the revolutionary people of the entire country, carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to the end and build our great socialist motherland into an even stronger world revolutionary base.

In Tianjin and Wuhan, tens of thousands and hundreds of thousands of revolutionary masses and People's Liberation Army soldiers and officers held grand rallies and parades today. The Tianjin Revolutionary Committee and military leaders spoke at the rally, saying, "As the great leader Chairman Mao pointed out in the declaration, the American black people's struggle against violence is a heavy blow to U.S. imperialism and a great support and encouragement to the Vietnamese people and the people of the world in their anti-U.S. struggle. It is a component of the world revolution in the contemporary era." The broad masses of Tianjin decided to, together with the revolutionary people of the entire country and the world, resolutely be the strong backbone of the American black people and all oppressed peoples. The leaders of the Hubei Provincial and Wuhan Municipal Revolutionary Committees spoke at the rally, saying, "Chairman Mao's great declaration is a lighthouse guiding the revolutionary people of the world to victory and a great program for the proletariat and revolutionary people of the world to carry out revolution. The world has entered a new era with Mao Zedong Thought as the great banner. We must have the country in our hearts and the world in our eyes, closely follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, and resolutely seize a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, better supporting the American black people's struggle against violence and the revolutionary struggles of the people of the world with actual actions."

Chairman Mao's great declaration reached Guangzhou, Nanning, Kunming, and other places on the front lines of supporting Vietnam and resisting the U.S. The revolutionary masses were overjoyed and resolutely expressed their determination to be a strong backbone for the American black people's struggle against violence and to fully support the Vietnamese people in fighting the anti-U.S. war of national salvation to the end. Today, 80,000 people in Guangzhou held a grand rally and demonstration. The leaders of the Guangdong Revolutionary Committee and the Guangzhou Military Region spoke at the rally, pointing out that the development of the American black people's struggle against violence declares the bankruptcy of non-violence and once again fully proves the great leader Chairman Mao's wise judgment: "The experience of class struggle in the era of imperialism tells us: the working class and laboring masses can only defeat the armed bourgeoisie and landlords with the force of the gun; in this sense, we can say that the whole world can only be changed with the gun." The revolutionary masses attending the rally expressed their determination to resolutely respond to the great call of the great commander Chairman Mao, fully supporting the American black people's struggle against violence and the Vietnamese people's anti-U.S. war of national salvation. In Nanning, 50,000 people from various ethnic groups and People's Liberation Army soldiers and officers held a grand rally and demonstration this afternoon.

In Kunming, large batches of Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams took to the streets, distributing extra editions, posting slogans, and performing newly edited art programs, spreading Chairman Mao's great voice to the broad revolutionary masses. The revolutionary people of Kunming excitedly said, "Chairman Mao's great declaration sounds the charge for all the oppressed peoples and oppressed nations of the world to strive for complete liberation and rings the death knell for U.S. imperialism and its accomplices."

The revolutionary people of the southeastern coastal regions, including Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Shandong, and Fujian, expressed their high fighting spirit, resolutely supporting Chairman Mao's great declaration and fighting shoulder to shoulder with the American black brothers and the revolutionary people of the world. Today, 150,000 revolutionary people in Nanjing braved the rain to hold a grand rally and parade in support of the American black people's struggle against violence. They said, "We support them a thousand times, ten thousand times, and will thoroughly carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in our country to the end. This is the greatest support for the American black people and the revolutionary people of the world. We must follow Chairman Mao's latest instructions, launch unceasing attacks on the class enemies, and build Jiangsu into a steel fortress on the eastern coast of the motherland against imperialism and revisionism." At the grand rally held by the Zhejiang Provincial and Hangzhou Municipal Revolutionary Committees today, the leaders of the provincial revolutionary committee said, "U.S. imperialism is in a state of internal and external difficulties and is on the verge of collapse. As our great leader Chairman Mao pointed out, 'The imperialists and domestic reactionaries will not willingly accept their defeat, and they will make their last struggle.' We in Zhejiang are on the front line of national defense and must be a hundred times more vigilant and ready to annihilate any enemy that dares to invade at any time."

In the heroic city of Nanchang, with its glorious revolutionary tradition, more than ten thousand military personnel and civilians held a grand rally in the People's Square today, resolutely supporting Chairman Mao's great declaration. The leaders of the Jiangxi Military Region spoke at the rally, saying, "The great leader Chairman Mao personally established the first revolutionary base area on Jinggangshan, opening up the correct path for the oppressed peoples and oppressed nations to strive for liberation. We, the children of Jinggangshan, are determined to, together with the people of the entire country, build our great motherland into an even stronger and more consolidated world revolutionary base."

Revolutionary masses of various ethnic groups held discussions, rallies, and parades. In Hohhot, the capital of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, more than 110,000 military personnel and civilians held a grand rally and demonstration. Many Uighur workers in Urumqi said at the rally, "Our most beloved great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: 'The struggle of nationalities, in the final analysis, is a class struggle issue.' Chairman Mao's great declaration once again reveals the class nature of the American black people's struggle against violence and points out the only correct path for the American black people and all oppressed peoples and oppressed nations to strive for liberation." At a rally attended by more than ten thousand military personnel and civilians in Yinchuan, the leaders of the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region Revolutionary Committee, the Ningxia garrison, and the revolutionary mass organizations spoke at the rally, unanimously expressing their determination to achieve "Not reaching the Great Wall is not a hero" and carry the current political revolution of the proletariat against the bourgeoisie and all exploiting classes to the end, more powerfully supporting the liberation struggles of the oppressed peoples and oppressed nations of the world.

The soldiers and officers said, "Chairman Mao's great declaration is the greatest support and encouragement for the American black people and the people of the world in their struggle against U.S. imperialism. It once again points out the bright path for all oppressed peoples and oppressed nations to completely liberate themselves. Chairman Mao's great declaration will certainly greatly inspire the people of the world to unite more closely and launch a sustained and fierce attack on the common enemy, U.S. imperialism, and its accomplices, thoroughly burying colonialism, imperialism, and all exploitative systems."

The publication of Chairman Mao's great declaration supporting the American black people's struggle against violence has caused a wave of excitement throughout the army.
