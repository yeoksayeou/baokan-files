The Revolutionary Committee of Nanjing Match Factory adheres to Chairman Mao's teaching of "never detaching from the masses for a single moment." They work alongside the masses in production groups, vigorously promoting revolution and production.

According to Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, April 13 — The members of the Revolutionary Committee of Nanjing Match Factory follow the great leader Chairman Mao's teaching of "wholeheartedly serving the people and never detaching from the masses." They rely closely on the masses, maintain close ties with them, and root themselves in production groups, working together with the broad masses to excel in both revolution and production throughout the factory.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "We Communists are not seeking office, but revolution. We must have a thorough revolutionary spirit. We must not detach from the masses for a single moment. As long as we do not detach from the masses, we are sure to win." After the Revolutionary Committee was established in September last year, its members studied Chairman Mao's teachings seriously and resolved to place their focus on production groups, closely connecting with the revolutionary masses. Of the eleven committee members, six worker representatives have remained at their original production posts, never leaving their labor. The five revolutionary cadres also strive to work half the day and labor the other half. Sorting worker and deputy committee member Peng Zaifen has consistently participated in production, maintaining the demeanor of an ordinary laborer. Old packaging worker and committee member Sun Yujie always cares for the masses, relies on the masses, and is often the first to enter the workshop and the last to leave. Workers praise that the committee members study Chairman Mao's works with them, promote revolution and production together, and their hearts and efforts are united.

The committee members, following Chairman Mao's teachings, correctly handle relations with the masses and actively unite with those who have differing opinions. Committee member Sun Yujie, following Chairman Mao's teachings, is not afraid of trouble or setbacks, and actively approaches those with differing opinions. The committee members unite the vast majority of the masses, jointly promoting revolution and production, and achieving outstanding results.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "Since we are serving the people, we should not be afraid of criticism and pointing out our shortcomings." The Revolutionary Committee of Nanjing Match Factory places its work under the supervision of the revolutionary masses, always listening to their opinions and criticisms. One day, committee member Cheng Wen, who leads the logistics service group, approved an expenditure. The accountant thought this expenditure did not align with Chairman Mao's instruction of "thrift for revolution" and raised objections. At that time, Cheng Wen thought the accountant was disrespectful and lost his temper. The committee immediately held a meeting to examine the attitude towards mass supervision. They realized that the masses daring to raise issues shows that they are actively learning and applying Chairman Mao Zedong Thought, which is a great thing that supports the committee. After the meeting, Cheng Wen actively apologized to the accountant, which deeply moved the accountant and many revolutionary masses. To actively accept the supervision of the revolutionary masses, the committee also regularly reports its work to the masses and encourages them to raise suggestions. Due to the enthusiasm of the revolutionary masses under the leadership of the committee, the current situation of revolution and production in the factory is getting better and better.

    南京火柴厂革委会遵循毛主席“一刻也不脱离群众”的教导
    以普通劳动者姿态扎根生产小组和群众在一起狠抓革命猛促生产
    据新华社南京十三日电　南京火柴厂革命委员会成员，遵循伟大领袖毛主席“全心全意地为人民服务，一刻也不脱离群众”的教导，紧紧依靠群众，密切联系群众，落脚到生产小组，扎根于群众之中，同广大群众一起把全厂的革命和生产搞得很出色。
    毛主席教导我们：“我们共产党人不是要做官，而是要革命，我们人人要有彻底的革命精神，我们不要有一时一刻脱离群众。只要我们不脱离群众，我们就一定会胜利。”南京火柴厂革委会在去年九月成立以后，革委会成员认真学习了毛主席的这些教导，都决心做到把落脚点放在生产小组，紧密地联系广大革命群众。厂革委会的十一名委员，六名工人代表都坚守原来的生产岗位，不脱离劳动；五名革命干部也努力做到半天劳动，半天工作。排梗工人、厂革委会副主任委员彭再凤一直坚持参加生产，保持了普通劳动者的本色。老装盒女工、厂革委会委员孙玉洁处处关心群众，依靠群众，经常最早一个进车间，最后一个出车间。工人们称赞说：革委会委员同我们一起学习毛主席著作，一起抓革命、促生产，我们心能想到一处，劲也能使到一处了。
    厂革委会成员遵照毛主席的教导，正确对待群众，主动团结和自己意见不相同的群众。厂革委会委员孙玉洁按照毛主席的教导，不怕麻烦，不怕碰钉子，主动亲近和她意见不相同的群众，谁对她意见多就主动去接近谁。革委会成员把绝大多数群众团结起来，共同抓革命、促生产，取得了出色的成绩。
    毛主席教导我们：“因为我们是为人民服务的，所以，我们如果有缺点，就不怕别人批评指出。”南京火柴厂革委会把自己的工作置于革命群众的监督之下，随时听取群众的意见和批评。一天，担任后勤服务组领导工作的厂革委会委员程文革批了一笔开支，会计认为这笔开支不符合毛主席“要节约闹革命”的指示精神，提出了意见。当时，程文革认为会计不尊重他，对会计发了脾气。厂革委会抓住这件事，马上开会检查对待群众监督的态度问题。他们认识到，群众敢于提意见，说明群众活学活用毛泽东思想好，是关心和支持革委会的大好事情。会后，程文革主动向会计作了自我批评，使会计和许多革命群众很受感动。厂革委会为了主动接受革命群众的监督，还定期向群众汇报厂革委会的工作，发动群众提意见。由于广大革命群众的积极性在厂革委会领导下得到发挥，目前，这个厂的革命和生产形势越来越好。
