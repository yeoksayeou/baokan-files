The U.S. imperialists have further intensified their exploitation and plunder of Latin America over the past year. The broad masses of the Latin American people are increasingly recognizing that this is the root cause of the worsening poverty in Latin America, and that U.S. imperialism is the most vicious enemy of the Latin American people.

The U.S. imperialists use their familiar method of expanding investments to further squeeze the wealth out of Latin America. This so-called "investment" is a gigantic blood-sucking machine. According to a recent announcement by the U.S. Department of Commerce, U.S. new investments in Latin America in 1967 reached $143.5 million, an increase of approximately $400 million compared to 1965. Of this, investments in mining reached $29 million, an increase of over 80% compared to 1965; investments in petroleum reached $36.5 million, an increase of nearly 19% compared to 1965.

The U.S. petroleum monopolies not only control the petroleum production of Venezuela, which ranks third in the world, plundering half of its products, but are also continually expanding their plunder. With the collusion of the pro-U.S. dictatorship in Brazil, the U.S. petroleum monopolies have already infiltrated all sectors of the Brazilian petroleum industry, which was previously restricted by the Brazilian authorities from foreign capital. They have also continued to obtain new petroleum exploration leases in Argentina and extended previously signed petroleum contracts. U.S. companies have also obtained exploration and extraction privileges in Guyana.

The U.S. imperialists are also simultaneously intensifying the plunder of strategic resources other than petroleum. Two U.S. monopoly capital companies, Anaconda and Braden Copper Company, control over 90% of Chile's copper extraction, squeezing out $100 million in profits annually. Since 1964, these two U.S. companies have further increased their investments in Chile under the guise of "joint ventures" with Chilean capital, planning to double Chile's annual copper production, utilizing Chile's cheap labor to expand the plunder of Chilean copper.

The U.S. imperialists, the largest landlord in Latin America, have further seized vast tracts of fertile land in Latin American countries through leasing and purchasing. Brazilian Congressman Marcio Moreira Alves recently pointed out that one-eighth of Brazil's territory has already been bought and occupied by foreigners, especially Americans. American monopoly capitalist Rockefeller owns 531,000 hectares of land in the Brazilian state of Mato Grosso, which is larger than many countries in Europe, Africa, and the Middle East. This blatant seizure of land has aroused great anger among various strata of Brazilian society.

The U.S. also depresses the prices of raw materials imported from Latin American countries in its trade relations with them, while striving to raise the prices of machines and manufactured goods exported to Latin American countries. Through this policy of buying cheap and selling dear, the U.S. imperialists are plundering Latin American countries on a massive scale.

The U.S. imperialists' frenzied plundering behavior completely exposes their so-called "aid" to Latin America as a sham, laying bare the true nature of the "Alliance for Progress" and other frauds. This has made the broad masses of the Latin American people more clearly see the ferocity and cunning of U.S. imperialism. The broad masses of the Latin American people are now conducting anti-plunder and anti-exploitation struggles in various ways. The crimes committed by U.S. imperialism on the Latin American continent will surely be thoroughly settled.

    美帝通过扩大投资、贸易等方式疯狂掠夺拉美资源
    美帝国主义是拉美人民最凶恶的敌人
    拉美人民正以各种方式开展反掠夺反剥削斗争
    据新华社二十八日讯美帝国主义在过去一年中进一步加紧了对拉丁美洲的压榨和掠夺。拉丁美洲广大人民越来越认识到，这正是拉丁美洲贫困加剧的总根源，美帝国主义是拉丁美洲人民最凶恶的敌人。
    美帝国主义通过它惯用的扩大投资来进一步榨取拉丁美洲的财富，这种“投资”就是一部巨大的吸血机器。据美国商务部最近宣布，一九六七年美国对拉丁美洲的新投资达到十四亿三千五百万美元，比一九六五年增加了约四亿美元。其中对矿业投资达二亿九千万美元，比一九六五年增加百分之八十以上；对石油投资达三亿六千五百万美元，比一九六五年增加了将近百分之十九。
    美国石油垄断集团不但已经控制了占世界第三位的委内瑞拉的石油生产，掠夺它一半的产品，而且还在不断地扩大它们的掠夺范围。美国石油垄断集团在巴西亲美独裁政权勾结下，已经打进了过去巴西当局限制外资侵入的巴西石油工业的各个领域。它们也在阿根廷继续取得新的开采石油的租让地，并延长了过去签订的石油合同。美国公司在圭亚那也取得了勘探和开采石油的特权。
    美帝国主义还同时加紧掠夺石油以外的战略物资。美国垄断资本的两家公司——安那康达和布拉登铜公司控制了智利铜的开采量的百分之九十以上，每年榨取一亿美元的利润。从一九六四年以来，这两家美国公司又在同智利资本实行“联营”的掩护下，进一步增加投资，计划把智利铜的年产量提高一倍，利用智利廉价劳动力，来扩大对智利铜的掠夺。
    美帝国主义这个拉丁美洲最大的大地主还通过租让和收买等方式，进一步侵占了拉美国家的大片肥沃的土地。巴西议员马尔西奥·莫雷拉·阿尔维斯不久前指出，巴西八分之一的国土已经被外国人，特别是美国人所收买和占有。美国垄断资本家洛克菲勒在巴西马托格罗索州就拥有五十三万一千公顷的土地，这比欧洲、非洲和中东许多国家的面积还要大。这种巧取豪夺的行为已经激起了巴西各阶层人士的极大愤怒。
    美国还在同拉美国家的贸易关系中，一手压低从拉美国家进口的原料价格，一手竭力抬高美国向拉美国家出口的机器和制成品的价格，通过这种贱买贵卖的帝国主义政策，对拉美国家实行数量惊人的掠夺。
    美帝国主义的这种疯狂掠夺行为，完全揭穿了它的所谓“援助”拉美的假面具，赤裸裸地暴露了“争取进步联盟”之类的骗局的实质，使拉丁美洲广大人民更加认清了美帝国主义的凶狠和狡猾的真面目。拉丁美洲广大人民正在以各种方式进行反掠夺反剥削斗争，美帝国主义在拉丁美洲大陆犯下的罪行必将得到彻底清算。
