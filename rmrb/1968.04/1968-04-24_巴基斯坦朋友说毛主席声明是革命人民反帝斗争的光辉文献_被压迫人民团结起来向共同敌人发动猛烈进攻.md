Pakistani friends have enthusiastically hailed Chairman Mao's declaration supporting the struggle of American blacks against violence. They unanimously believe that this declaration is a significant milestone in the struggle of American blacks for liberation and a historic document for the anti-imperialist struggle of all revolutionary people in the world.

On April 22, Miraj Khalid, Secretary-General of the Pakistan Afro-Asian People's Solidarity Organization, gave a written statement to a reporter from Xinhua News Agency in Lahore. He pointed out that Chairman Mao's declaration is a clarion call to the people of the world. It not only greatly encourages the struggle of American blacks for liberation but will also unite all oppressed peoples to launch a sustained and fierce attack on their common enemy, American imperialism, and its lackeys.

On April 23, the famous Pakistani writer Safdar Mir issued a written statement saying that the assassination of Martin Luther King once again proves the failure of non-violence in the face of imperialist counter-revolutionary violence. American blacks, through their personal experiences, have come to realize that only through revolutionary violence aimed at overthrowing the rule of monopoly capitalism can they guarantee freedom from racial discrimination and various forms of exploitation.

He also said that Pakistani writers and people support the struggle of American blacks and all revolutionary people in the world against oppression.

On April 22, Pakistani journalist Masud Ulla Khan said that the great teacher Chairman Mao's declaration clearly points out the path for the struggle of American blacks. The oppressed peoples of Asia, Africa, and Latin America can only achieve freedom through armed struggle.

    巴基斯坦朋友说毛主席声明是革命人民反帝斗争的光辉文献
    被压迫人民团结起来向共同敌人发动猛烈进攻
    新华社拉合尔二十三日电　巴基斯坦朋友热烈欢呼毛主席支持美国黑人抗暴斗争的声明。他们一致认为，这个声明是美国黑人争取解放斗争中的重要里程碑，是世界一切革命人民反帝斗争的具有历史意义的文献。
    巴基斯坦亚非人民团结组织秘书长米拉杰·哈立德二十二日在拉合尔向新华社记者发表书面谈话指出，毛主席的声明是对全世界人民发出的响亮号召，不仅大大地鼓舞了美国黑人争取解放的斗争，而且将使一切被压迫人民团结起来，向他们的共同敌人美帝国主义及其帮凶发动持久的猛烈的进攻。
    巴基斯坦著名作家萨夫达尔·米尔二十三日发表书面谈话说，马丁·路德·金的被暗杀再次证明在帝国主义的反革命暴力面前非暴力主义的破产。美国黑人通过亲身的经验教训，认识到只有通过目的在于摧毁垄断资本主义统治的革命暴力，才能保证摆脱种族歧视和种种剥削。
    他还说，巴基斯坦的作家和人民支持美国黑人和全世界革命人民反对压迫的斗争。
    巴基斯坦记者马苏德·乌拉·汗二十二日说，伟大导师毛主席的声明，明确地指出了美国黑人斗争的道路。亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲被压迫人民只有通过武装斗争，才能获得自由。
