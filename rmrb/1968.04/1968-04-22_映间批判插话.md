Scene: Dawn sky, sunlight piercing through the clouds and pouring onto the earth, a train is rushing forward, and the incarnation of the Chinese Khrushchev, Lei Huanjue, is sitting on top of the train. The subtitle "1921" appears.

Intermission: What a scene of a "savior" descending from heaven! This is the masterstroke of the reactionary film "Spark" in erecting a monument to the Chinese Khrushchev. They use symbolic methods to depict the great traitor Chinese Khrushchev as the "sunlight illuminating the earth," a "hero" born with the Party, creating public opinion for the Chinese Khrushchev to usurp the Party and restore capitalism.

Scene: Chen the foreman provokes trouble at the night school, and Lei Huanjue says confidently, "The Common People's Education Society has sent a letter to the chairman of the society here, and I have already paid my respects." Chen the foreman: "If it's run by the officials, that's good..."

Intermission: This is a true portrayal of the Chinese Khrushchev advocating "legal struggle." After the incarnation of the Chinese Khrushchev, Lei Huanjue, arrived in Anshan, the first thing he did was to seek the "legalization" of his personal identity and the "legalization" of the struggle. To set up a night school, he had to rely on the "official notice" and the "authority" of the chamber of commerce, to wear the legal cloak of "official operation"; to set up a workers' club, he had to "submit a request to the Pingxiang County for registration and seek protection." The Chinese Khrushchev thus changed the revolutionary nature of the workers' club, turning it into a tool for serving the capitalists under the "protection" of the ruling authorities. The reactionary film "Spark" vigorously advocates "legal struggle," which is to negate armed struggle and negate the brilliant truth that "political power grows out of the barrel of a gun."

Scene: The ventilation shaft is broken, worker Liu Deping is poisoned by coal gas, and a few workers want to find the mine bureau to struggle, but the old worker Zhang Laogeng hurriedly stops them, saying, "Don't cause trouble, absolutely don't cause trouble! If the charge of gathering to cause trouble is pressed down, it's either beheading or imprisonment..."

Intermission: The reactionary film "Spark" thus maliciously defames the working class with a glorious revolutionary tradition. The workers appearing in the film are all a group of people without political awareness, willingly accepting exploitation and oppression. They are either "mob" without knowledge or courage, or cowards who are slaughtered without any spirit of resistance. They are just extras following the "savior" incarnation of the Chinese Khrushchev, Lei Huanjue, existing only to set off Lei Huanjue. To smear the working class and to apply makeup to the Chinese Khrushchev, this fully exposes the reactionary stance of the film's creators.

Scene: Yi Mengzi says to Lei Huanjue, "Old Lei, tell me how to do it. From now on, wherever you point, I will go. Whether it's climbing the knife mountain or entering the fire sea, I will not turn back!"

Intermission: This is not the words of the worker Yi Mengzi, but clearly the voice of the Chinese Khrushchev and his gang. They are trying to use the reactionary film "Spark" to depict the Chinese Khrushchev as a hero who calls from the heights and responds from all directions, to recruit and gather forces for their restoration of capitalism. However, the Chinese working class and revolutionary people will never follow the old opportunist, great traitor Chinese Khrushchev. Let the Chinese Khrushchev and the small group of traitors, spies, and unrepentant capitalist roaders who follow him go to hell!

    映间批判插话
    边吉
    画面：破晓天空，阳光透过乌云倾泻大地，一列火车奔驰而来，中国赫鲁晓夫的化身雷焕觉坐在车顶上，推出“一九二一年”字幕。
    插话：好一幅“救世主”下凡的景象！这是反动影片《燎原》的炮制者为中国赫鲁晓夫树碑立传的点睛之笔。他们就是通过象征性的手法，把中国赫鲁晓夫这个大叛徒描写成“普照大地的阳光”，与党一同诞生的“英雄”，为中国赫鲁晓夫篡党篡政、复辟资本主义大造舆论。
    画面：陈工头在夜校寻衅，雷焕觉振振有词地说：“平民教育会有信给这里的沈会长，我已经拜望过了。”陈工头：“是官家办的就好……”
    插话：这是中国赫鲁晓夫鼓吹“合法斗争”的真实写照。中国赫鲁晓夫的化身雷焕觉来到安源后，头一件事就是争取个人身份的“合法化”，争取斗争的“合法化”。办一个夜校，要借助于“衙门告示”和商会会长的“权威”，要披上“官家办”的合法外衣；办一个工人俱乐部，要“呈请萍乡县立案，并请示保护”。中国赫鲁晓夫就是这样的篡改工人俱乐部的革命性质，把它变为在统治当局“保护”下为资本家奔走效劳的御用工具。反动影片《燎原》竭力鼓吹“合法斗争”，就是要否定武装斗争，否定“枪杆子里面出政权”的光辉真理。
    画面：通风巷坏了，工人刘德平煤气中毒，几个工人要找矿局进行斗争，老工人张老耿连忙制止说：“闹不得，千万闹不得！聚众闹事这个罪名压下来，不是杀头就是坐班房……”
    插话：反动影片《燎原》就是这样恶毒地丑化具有光荣革命传统的工人阶级。影片里出现的工人，都是一群没有政治觉悟，甘受剥削压迫的芸芸众生。他们不是“无知无识”的“群氓”，就是任人宰割毫无反抗精神的“懦夫”。他们只是跟着中国赫鲁晓夫的化身雷焕觉这个“救世主”跑龙套的小丑，只是为了衬托雷焕觉而存在。往工人阶级脸上抹灰，往中国赫鲁晓夫脸上搽粉，这充分暴露了影片炮制者的反动立场。
    画面：易猛子对雷焕觉说：“老雷，该怎么干你说吧。从今以后你往那儿指，我往那儿走，上刀山，下火海，我决不回头！”
    插话：这哪里是工人易猛子的话，分明是中国赫鲁晓夫及其一伙的心声。他们就是妄图通过反动影片《燎原》，把中国赫鲁晓夫塑造成登高一呼，八方响应的“英雄”，为他们复辟资本主义招降纳叛，拼凑队伍。但是，中国工人阶级和革命人民决不会跟着老机会主义者、大叛徒中国赫鲁晓夫走。让中国赫鲁晓夫和跟着他“走”的一小撮叛徒、特务、顽固不化的走资派见鬼去吧！
