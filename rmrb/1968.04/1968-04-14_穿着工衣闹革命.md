Workers in the Zhaluke Coal Mine in Hebei Province always sing the praises of Qin Mingyong, the deputy chairman of the revolutionary committee and a worker, saying, "Old Qin is a good example for us workers. He is a pioneer in making revolution and a model in promoting production."

Qin Mingyong, a miner whose ancestors had been laborers for landlords and who had tasted the bitterness of old society, has deep proletarian feelings for the great leader Chairman Mao. For over a decade, he has persisted in studying Chairman Mao's works and has been clear-headed in his work. He often says, "Father and mother are not as dear as Chairman Mao. If it weren't for Chairman Mao liberating me, who knows how much more bitterness I would have had to endure?" At the start of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, he joined the workers in rebelling against the handful of power-hungry elements within the Party and waged a tenacious struggle against the capitalist reactionary line pushed by the Chinese Khrushchev. Revolutionary workers elected him as the leader of the revolutionary mass organization. From then on, he led all the revolutionary workers in the mine to uphold revolution above ground and promote production below ground, setting an example of seizing revolution and promoting production.

After Qin Mingyong became the leader of the revolutionary mass organization, his work became very busy. Often, he would stay up all night without sleep, and sometimes he would only have one meal a day. Even so, he never missed a shift of production. Once, Qin Mingyong went to the city for a meeting and couldn't return by nightfall, missing the night shift. The next day, he hurried back early in the morning, didn't even wash his face or eat, put on his overalls, took his miner's lamp, and went down to the pit to work. The workers were concerned that he might not be able to endure the physical strain and advised him to rest. He replied, "We must make revolution in our spare time. This is Chairman Mao's instruction to us, and we must not make any compromises." At home, his wife and children also advised him to rest a bit. Qin Mingyong understood their feelings. He had often gathered the whole family together to hold "bitterness and sweetness" sessions, using the family's history of three generations of oppression and exploitation to educate the family not to forget their roots and to maintain the character of the working class.

For a period, the mine was affected by anarchist tendencies from society. Qin Mingyong recognized that this was a means by which the bourgeoisie was attacking the proletariat and that it must be resolutely struck down and resisted. He organized all the revolutionary workers in the mine to study Chairman Mao's teaching of "strengthening discipline, revolution invincible" and to strongly oppose anarchism, exposing the class enemies' plots and tricks of using anarchism to disrupt the revolution and production. At the same time, he had heart-to-heart talks with individual workers who were influenced by anarchist ideas. There was a mechanic who would go to work late every evening and leave early. Qin Mingyong studied "Sixteen Points" and Chairman Mao's great directive of "seizing revolution and promoting production" with him, explaining that the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution was to revolutionize people's thinking, thereby making all work done better, faster, more, and more economically. With his help, the mechanic seriously studied Chairman Mao's teachings, raised his consciousness, and together with everyone else, seized the revolution and vigorously promoted production.

After the establishment of the Zhaluke Coal Mine Revolutionary Committee, Qin Mingyong became the deputy chairman. He firmly remembered Chairman Mao's teaching of "being both an 'official' and a common person" and paid even more attention to maintaining close ties with the masses. He believed that going down to the pit to work was not only not to be reduced but should be increased, frequently, to maintain close ties with the masses and to forever preserve the character of an ordinary worker. Once, he went to attend a county revolutionary committee meeting. After the meeting ended, he had to return the next day to attend a county-wide conference of active participants in studying Chairman Mao's works. Without hesitation, he rushed back to the coal mine by night, worked an early shift the next day, and then returned to the county to attend the meeting. On the first day of the Spring Festival holiday, he went down to the pit with the soldiers of the left-support group to put up portraits of Chairman Mao and quotations from Chairman Mao. The next day, he and other committee members visited communes and production brigades within a radius of thirty to forty li around the mine, going door to door to visit workers who had returned home for family visits. He cared for and connected with the masses in this way, and the workers were deeply moved, saying, "Old Qin is truly our confidant."

For over a year, Qin Mingyong has consistently implemented Chairman Mao's great policy of "seizing revolution and promoting production," with a high sense of political responsibility for socialist construction and the attitude of a master of the state, insisting on working in overalls to make the revolution, firmly guarding the production post, insisting on the eight-hour workday, and actively maintaining socialist labor discipline. Under his and other committee members' leadership, all the revolutionary workers in the mine have insisted on making revolution in their spare time, with the mine's attendance rate always stable at over 98%. Since last year, the mine has exceeded the state production plan every month.

    穿着工衣闹革命
    在河北省涿鹿煤矿，工人们一提起革命委员会副主任、工人秦明永同志，总是赞不绝口地说：“老秦是咱工人的好榜样，既是抓革命的闯将，又是促生产的模范。”
    秦明永这个祖祖辈辈给地主扛长活，饱尝旧社会苦水的老矿工，对伟大领袖毛主席有着深厚的无产阶级感情。十几年来，他坚持学习毛主席著作，干起工作来心明眼亮。他常说：“爹亲娘亲不如毛主席亲。要不是毛主席解放了我，我还不知要喝多少苦水呢。”无产阶级文化大革命一开始，他和工人一起造了党内一小撮走资派的反，对中国赫鲁晓夫所推行的资产阶级反动路线进行了顽强的斗争。革命工人推选他为革命群众组织的负责人。从那时起，他就带领全矿革命工人坚持上井搞好革命，下井搞好生产，为工人们作出了抓革命、促生产的榜样。
    秦明永同志担任革命群众组织负责人以后，工作很忙。经常是整宵整宵的不睡觉，有时甚至一天只吃上一顿饭。就是这样，他从来没有耽误过一班生产。有一次秦明永去城里开会，天黑了回不来，误了夜班，第二天，他一早赶回来，脸没顾得洗，饭没顾上吃，穿上工衣，带上矿灯，就下井劳动去了。工人们担心他体力吃不消，劝他休息一下。他回答说：“要业余闹革命，这是毛主席对我们的指示，不能打半点折扣。”回到家里，他爱人和孩子也劝他适当休息一下。秦明永理解他们的心情，他曾多次把全家叫在一起，开展忆苦思甜活动，用过去全家三辈受压迫受剥削的苦难史，教育全家不要忘本，保持工人阶级的本色。
    有一个时期，社会上的无政府主义思潮向矿上袭来。秦明永认识到，这是资产阶级向无产阶级进攻的一种手段，必须迎头痛击，顶住这股妖风。他便组织全矿革命工人学习毛主席的“加强纪律性，革命无不胜”的教导，大反无政府主义，揭露阶级敌人利用无政府主义破坏革命和生产的阴谋诡计，同时找个别受无政府主义思潮影响的工人谈心。有一个机电工每天晚上班，早下班。秦明永就和他一起学习“十六条”和毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的伟大指示，向他说明无产阶级文化大革命，就是为的要使人的思想革命化，因而使各项工作做得更多、更快、更好、更省。在他的帮助下，这个机电工认真学习毛主席的教导，提高了觉悟，同大家一道狠抓革命，猛促生产。
    涿鹿煤矿革命委员会成立后，秦明永担任了革委会副主任。他牢记毛主席的“既当‘官’，又当老百姓”的教导，更加注意密切联系群众。他认为，下井劳动不但不能少，更得要多下井，勤下井，才能保持同群众的密切联系，永葆普通工人的本色。有一次，他去参加县革委会会议，会议结束后，隔一天就又要接着开全县学习毛主席著作积极分子代表大会。他毫不犹豫，连夜赶回煤矿，第二天上了一个早班，才又回到县里开会。春节休假的第一天，他和解放军支左小组的同志一起，下井张贴毛主席像和毛主席语录，第二天又和革委会其他委员跑遍矿区周围三四十里的公社和生产大队，挨门逐户慰问矿上回家探亲的工人。他这样关心群众、联系群众，工人们很受感动，都说：“老秦真是咱们的贴心人”。
    一年多来，秦明永始终贯彻执行毛主席的“抓革命，促生产”的伟大方针，以对社会主义建设事业的高度政治责任感和国家主人翁的态度，坚持穿着工衣闹革命，一直坚守生产岗位，坚持八小时工作制，积极维护社会主义的劳动纪律。在他和革委会其他成员的带领下，全矿革命工人也坚持业余闹革命，全矿出勤率始终稳定在百分之九十八以上。去年以来，这个矿月月超额完成国家生产计划。
