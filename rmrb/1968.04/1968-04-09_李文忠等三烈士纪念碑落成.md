More than 500,000 military personnel and civilians of Nanchang City solemnly held a ceremony for the completion of the memorial monument for the three martyrs Li Wenzhong, Li Congquan, and Chen Diankui. They expressed their determination to learn from Li Wenzhong and the heroic Fourth Platoon, to be forever loyal to Chairman Mao, and to achieve new victories for the people in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

XINHUA NEWS AGENCY, NANCHANG, April 8th — More than 50,000 military personnel and civilians of Jiangxi Province gathered in Nanchang City on the 5th to solemnly hold a ceremony for the completion of the memorial monument for the martyrs Li Wenzhong, Li Congquan, and Chen Diankui.

The memorial monument is located at the place where the "model of supporting the left and serving the people" Li Wenzhong and his comrades Li Congquan and Chen Diankui heroically sacrificed their lives — the Yelou Ferry in the suburbs of Nanchang City.

The meeting began with the stirring song of "The Internationale." The military personnel and civilians held red copies of "Quotations from Chairman Mao," and together they recited: "Thousands upon thousands of martyrs have heroically sacrificed their lives for the people's interests in front of us. Let us hold high their banners and march forward along the path of their blood!"

Following this, the unveiling ceremony for the memorial monument of the martyrs Li Wenzhong, Li Congquan, and Chen Diankui was held. When the commander of the Jiangxi Provincial Military Region, Yang Dongliang, the responsible person of the Jiangxi Revolutionary Committee, Huang Xian, the responsible person of the provincial "Great Alliance Preparation Committee," Wan Lilang, and Li Wenzhong's younger brother Li Wenhong unveiled the monument, the entire audience stood in silence, paying their respects to the martyrs, and shouted slogans such as "Learn from and salute the 'model of supporting the left and serving the people' Li Wenzhong and Li Congquan!" "Learn from and salute the 'heroic Fourth Platoon'!" "Long live the great People's Liberation Army!" "Long live, long live, and ten thousand years to the great leader Chairman Mao!" and so on.

The deputy director of the Jiangxi Revolutionary Committee, Huang Xian, the deputy political commissar of the Jiangxi Military Region, Wen Daohong, the deputy director of the Jiangxi Revolutionary Committee and the responsible person of the provincial "Great Alliance Preparation Committee," Wan Lilang, the director of the Nanchang Revolutionary Committee, Yu Dexin, as well as representatives from the heroic Fourth Platoon, Nanchang Fifteenth Middle School, Jiangxi Cotton Textile Printing and Dyeing Factory, and poor and lower-middle peasants from Jiangxi Street spoke at the meeting. They said in their speeches, "The 'model of supporting the left and serving the people' Li Wenzhong is a hero nurtured by Mao Zedong Thought, a prominent representative of the advanced elements of the proletarian dictatorship continuing the revolution, and a shining example personally set by the great leader Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin. We must learn well from comrade Li Wenzhong and the heroic Fourth Platoon, be as loyal to Chairman Mao as they were, be as loyal to Mao Zedong Thought as they were, and be as loyal to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line as they were. We must truly achieve 'Chairman Mao loves me, I love Chairman Mao; Chairman Mao supports me, I support Chairman Mao; Chairman Mao instructs me, I follow; Chairman Mao waves his hand, I march forward,' and fully implement Chairman Mao's series of latest instructions in the great struggle to achieve a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and achieve new victories for the people."
