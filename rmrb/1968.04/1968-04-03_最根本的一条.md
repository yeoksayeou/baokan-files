Chairman Mao recently instructed us: "The most fundamental principle in the reform of state organs is to maintain close ties with the masses."

Newly established revolutionary committees must cultivate a new revolutionary style, maintaining the broadest, most frequent, and closest ties with the working people. As Chairman Mao has pointed out, "This is a fundamental matter in a socialist system, which helps to overcome bureaucratism, prevent revisionism, and dogmatism."

Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line is one that comes from the masses and returns to the masses. Members of revolutionary committees must deeply root themselves among the masses, serving the people wholeheartedly, being both "officials" and "common people." The comrades of the Qinghai Mutual Aid Tu Autonomous County Revolutionary Committee are doing just that. With great revolutionary enthusiasm, carrying Chairman Mao's works, and with backpacks on their shoulders, they trekked through mountains and rivers, walking three hundred miles to reach deep mountain areas that county officials had never visited before. They brought the latest instructions from Chairman Mao and his care and warmth to the poor and lower-middle peasants.

We should learn from them, go deep into the masses, and timely understand the needs and wishes of the broad masses. We should concentrate the wisdom of the broad masses, summarize and promote advanced experiences, and implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions and the party's policies. We should also place ourselves under the help and supervision of the masses, listen to their opinions and criticisms at all times, improve our thinking, and improve our work.

All levels of revolutionary committees should integrate the three-eight style of the People's Liberation Army, the hardworking and self-reliant spirit of the working people, and our party's fine tradition of maintaining close ties with the masses. This will make ourselves truly revolutionary command headquarters.

The revolutionary workers of the Nanchang General Machinery Factory said well: Some cadres started off well but later changed their minds and made serious mistakes. Why did this happen? An important reason is that they did not listen to Chairman Mao's words, looked down on the masses, became detached from the masses, and suppressed the masses.

Every member of all levels of revolutionary committees must learn from this lesson and always regard maintaining close ties with the masses as an important sign of loyalty to the great leader Chairman Mao, loyalty to the great Mao Zedong Thought, and loyalty to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. It is also an important sign that distinguishes the proletarian dictatorship from all exploiting class regimes.

We must never forget this most fundamental principle.

    最根本的一条
    本报评论员
    毛主席最近教导我们：“国家机关的改革，最根本的一条，就是联系群众。”
    新生的革命委员会，一定要树立起崭新的革命作风，“同劳动人民保持最广泛的、经常的、密切的联系。”正如毛主席所指出的，“这是社会主义制度下一件带根本性的大事，它有助于克服官僚主义，防止修正主义和教条主义。”
    毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，就是从群众中来、到群众中去的路线。革命委员会的成员要深深地扎根于群众之中，全心全意地为人民服务，“既当‘官’，又当老百姓”。青海互助土族自治县革命委员会的同志们正是这样做的。他们怀着极大的革命热情，带着毛主席著作，背起背包，跋山涉水，步行三百里，到县的干部从来没有到过的深山区，给贫下中农送去了毛主席的最新指示，送去了毛主席的关怀和温暖。
    我们应当向他们学习，深入到群众中去，及时地了解广大群众的需要和愿望，集中广大群众的智慧，总结和推广先进经验，把毛主席的最新指示和党的方针政策落实下去；并且把自己置于群众的帮助和监督之下，随时倾听群众的意见和批评，提高思想，改进工作。
    各级革命委员会，都应当把解放军的三八作风，劳动人民艰苦奋斗的品质和我党联系群众的优良传统融合在一起，使自己真正成为革命化的战斗指挥部。
    南昌通用机械厂的革命工人说得好：过去有的干部开始很好，以后思想变了，犯了严重错误。为什么会变呢？一个重要的原因，就是因为不听毛主席的话，瞧不起群众，脱离群众，压制群众。
    各级革命委员会的每一个成员，都要记取这个教训，始终把密切联系群众看成是忠于伟大领袖毛主席，忠于伟大的毛泽东思想，忠于毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的一个重要标志，看成是无产阶级政权区别于一切剥削阶级政权的一个重要标志。
    我们千万不要忘记这个最根本的一条。
