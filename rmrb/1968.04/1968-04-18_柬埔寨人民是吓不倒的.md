On April 1, an American aggressor aircraft brazenly violated Cambodian airspace and deliberately provoked an incident. The Cambodian naval air defense forces immediately shot down the American plane, giving the American aggressors a severe punishment. On April 15, the Office of the Head of State of Cambodia issued a statement strongly condemning the U.S. imperialists' aggression against Cambodia and their shameless war threats. The Chinese people firmly support the Royal Government of Cambodia and the Cambodian people in their just actions to defend their territorial sovereignty and national independence.

The U.S. imperialists have always been enemies of the Cambodian people, constantly carrying out military provocations and subversive activities against Cambodia, doing many evil deeds. In recent months, the Johnson administration, in an attempt to salvage its failed aggression in Vietnam, has been seeking a way out through expanded military adventures, trying to spread the war to the entire Indochina. The U.S. imperialists' aggression and interference in Cambodia have become even more brazen. American-South Vietnamese puppet aircraft have repeatedly violated Cambodian airspace, conducting strafing and rocket attacks, and American-South Vietnamese puppet forces have continuously provoked incidents on Cambodian territory, even establishing forward bases. From February 26 to March 9 alone, the American-South Vietnamese puppet forces carried out 89 provocations against Cambodia. The U.S. imperialists' arbitrary bullying of Cambodia is, of course, something that the Cambodian people, who cherish their country's independence and sovereignty, absolutely cannot tolerate.

The Cambodian people's just struggle against the American aggressors has won the praise and support of the peoples of Asia and the world. However, the aggression-prone American ruling clique, in a fit of shame and anger, has used the incident of the American plane being shot down to engage in war threats against Cambodia. U.S. imperialist elements even arrogantly declare that they want to "destroy" the Cambodian navy, even "destroy" the entire Cambodia, in an attempt to intimidate Cambodia into submission. This fully exposes the ugly face of the American aggressor.

The American aggressors want to "destroy" Cambodia? They are indeed full of bluster! But in fact, U.S. imperialism is nothing more than a paper tiger. The U.S. imperialists have repeatedly boasted about "pacifying" the people of South Vietnam, but the result is that they have not only failed to "pacify" the people of South Vietnam, but have been beaten to a pulp by the heroic people of South Vietnam, suffering a crushing defeat. Vietnam, Laos, Cambodia, and other countries in Indochina, although they are small countries, have justice on their side in their struggle against the American aggressors. If the U.S. imperialists dare to launch an aggression against Cambodia, the ones who will be "destroyed" will not be Cambodia, but the American aggressors themselves.

Our great teacher Chairman Mao teaches us: "The Chinese people regard the victories of the people of Asia, Africa, and Latin America in their struggles against imperialism as their own victories, and they give enthusiastic support to all their anti-imperialist and anti-colonialist struggles."

U.S. imperialism is a common enemy of the Chinese people and the Cambodian people, and a common enemy of the peoples of the world. The Chinese people, following the teachings of our great teacher Chairman Mao, have consistently and firmly supported the Cambodian people in their just struggle against the aggression of U.S. imperialism and its lackeys, and in their defense of national independence, sovereignty, and territorial integrity. If the U.S. imperialists dare to expand their aggression to Cambodia, the Chinese people will stand firmly with the Cambodian people and be their steadfast rear guard.

    柬埔寨人民是吓不倒的
    本报评论员
    四月一日，美国强盗飞机一架，悍然侵入柬埔寨领空，蓄意寻衅。柬埔寨海军防空部队当场击中美国飞机，给予美国侵略者以严厉的惩罚。柬埔寨国家元首办公厅四月十五日发表声明，强烈谴责美帝国主义对柬埔寨的侵略行径和无耻的战争讹诈。中国人民坚决支持柬埔寨王国政府和柬埔寨人民维护领土主权和民族独立的正义行动。
    美帝国主义一贯与柬埔寨人民为敌，对柬埔寨不断进行军事挑衅和颠覆破坏活动，干了许多坏事。最近几个月，约翰逊政府为了挽救它侵越战争的失败，从扩大军事冒险中寻找出路，企图把战火烧到整个印度支那。美帝国主义对柬埔寨的侵略和干涉活动，更加变本加厉。美国—南越伪军飞机不断入侵柬埔寨领空，进行扫射和发射火箭，美国—南越伪军连续在柬埔寨领土进行挑衅，甚至建立前哨据点。仅从二月二十六日至三月九日，美国—南越伪军就对柬埔寨先后进行了八十九次挑衅。美帝国主义对柬埔寨这样恣意的欺侮，当然是珍视自己国家独立和主权的柬埔寨人民所绝对不能容忍的。
    柬埔寨人民英勇反击美国侵略者的正义斗争，得到了亚洲和世界人民的赞扬和支持。而侵略成性的美国统治集团，却老羞成怒，利用美国飞机被击中一事，对柬埔寨大搞战争讹诈。美帝国主义分子甚至狂妄地叫嚷，要“摧毁”柬埔寨海军，甚至“摧毁”整个柬埔寨，妄想胁迫柬埔寨屈服，这充分暴露了美国侵略强盗的狰狞面目。
    美国侵略者要“摧毁”柬埔寨吗？真是气势汹汹！但是，事实上，美帝国主义不过是一只外强中干的纸老虎。美帝国主义不是也曾经多次扬言要“平定”南越人民吗？结果是，它不仅没有能够“平定”南越人民，相反地却被英雄的南越人民打得头破血流，一败涂地。越南、老挝、柬埔寨等印度支那各国，虽然都是小国，但在反对美国侵略者的斗争中，正义是在它们一边的。美帝国主义如果胆敢对柬埔寨发动侵略，遭到“摧毁”的决不是柬埔寨，而只能是美国侵略者自己。
    我们的伟大导师毛主席教导说：“中国人民把亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲人民的反帝国主义斗争的胜利看作是自己的胜利，并对他们的一切反帝国主义、反殖民主义的斗争给以热烈的同情和支持。”
    美帝国主义是中国人民和柬埔寨人民的共同敌人，是全世界人民的共同敌人。中国人民遵循伟大导师毛主席的教导，一贯坚决支持柬埔寨人民反对美帝国主义及其仆从的侵略，维护民族独立、主权和领土完整的正义斗争。美帝国主义胆敢把侵略战争扩大到柬埔寨，中国人民将坚决站在柬埔寨人民一边，誓做柬埔寨人民的坚强后盾。
