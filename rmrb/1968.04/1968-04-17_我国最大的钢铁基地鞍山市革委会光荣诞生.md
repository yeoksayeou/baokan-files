The workers of the steel city and the broad revolutionary masses, holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, with the resolute support of the PLA, have united as one, fought bravely, and smashed the various plots of the class enemy. They have won a decisive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. Now they are advancing in victory, determined to carry the political revolution of the proletariat against the bourgeoisie and all exploiting classes through to the end.

Xinhua News Agency, Anshan, April 16th - The workers of China's largest steel industrial base, Anshan, and the broad revolutionary masses, holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, closely following Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, after more than a year of heroic struggle, have thoroughly smashed the evil plots of the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents in Anshan to restore capitalism, and won a decisive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

In the face of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution's continuous victories and the excellent situation of revolution and production, the Anshan Municipal Revolutionary Committee has recently been born in glory.

For a long time, in the steel city of Anshan, the struggle between the two classes, the two roads, and the two lines has been extremely fierce and sharp. The Chinese Khrushchev and the handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party, along with their agents in Anshan, have frantically pushed the counter-revolutionary revisionist line, vigorously promoting capitalist restoration activities. In the unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, they stubbornly carried out the reactionary line of the bourgeoisie, ruthlessly suppressing the revolutionary masses of the proletariat, inciting the masses to fight against each other, directing the spearhead at the great People's Liberation Army, and sabotaging the revolution and production. They have committed heinous crimes against the Party and the people.

The workers of Anshan and the broad revolutionary masses, who are infinitely loyal to the great leader Chairman Mao, with the resolute support of the PLA Anshan garrison and the 3174th Unit, have united as one, fought bravely, and engaged in repeated struggles and tenacious battles with a handful of counter-revolutionary revisionists. They have thoroughly smashed the various plots of the class enemy and have made great contributions to the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in Anshan.

Looking at Anshan today, the revolutionary torrent is surging forward, and industrial and agricultural production is thriving. The great thought of Mao Zedong has never been as deeply rooted in people's hearts as it is today, and people's proletarian consciousness has never been as high as it is today. Everywhere are classrooms for studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought, and everywhere are battlefields for criticizing and repudiating the self. The city has already held over 8,100 sessions of various types of Mao Zedong Thought study classes, with over 440,000 participants. The great criticism of the revolution is deepening step by step. Revolutionary unity and the three-in-one combination are becoming more consolidated and developed. Over 800 units across the city have established revolutionary committees or revolutionary leading groups. Except for one unit, all factories and mines under Anshan Steel Corporation have now established revolutionary committees. The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has powerfully promoted industrial and agricultural production. The production level of Anshan Steel is continuously rising, and new production records are emerging.

After the birth of the Anshan Municipal Revolutionary Committee, following the great leader Chairman Mao's instruction "Never forget class struggle" and his latest brilliant directives, it leads the workers of the city and the revolutionary people to continue to focus on the struggle between the two classes, the two roads, and the two lines, to focus on the great criticism of the revolution, and to launch an unceasing attack on the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents in Anshan. It will thoroughly eliminate the series of counter-revolutionary revisionist poisons they have spread and carry the current political revolution of the proletariat against the bourgeoisie and all exploiting classes through to the end. The workers of Anshan and the broad revolutionary masses have expressed their determination to, under the leadership of the municipal revolutionary committee, hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought even higher, advance in victory, develop the excellent situation, and seize the comprehensive victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in terms of ideology, politics, economy, and organization!

    钢都工人阶级和广大革命群众，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，在解放军坚决支持下，团结一致，英勇奋战，粉碎了阶级敌人的种种阴谋，夺得了无产阶级文化大革命的决定性胜利。现在他们正在乘胜前进，决心把反对资产阶级和一切剥削阶级的政治大革命进行到底。
    新华社鞍山十六日电　我国最大的钢铁工业基地鞍山市的工人阶级和广大革命群众，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，经过一年多的英勇斗争，彻底粉碎中国赫鲁晓夫及其在鞍山的代理人妄图复辟资本主义的罪恶阴谋，取得了无产阶级文化大革命的决定性胜利。
    在无产阶级文化大革命节节胜利，革命和生产一片大好的形势下，鞍山市革命委员会已经在最近光荣诞生。
    长期以来，在钢都鞍山，两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的斗争一直非常激烈，非常尖锐。中国赫鲁晓夫等党内最大的一小撮走资派及其在鞍山的代理人，疯狂地推行反革命修正主义路线，大搞资本主义复辟活动。在史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命中，他们又顽固地执行资产阶级反动路线，残酷地镇压无产阶级革命派，挑动群众斗群众，把矛头指向伟大的中国人民解放军，破坏革命，破坏生产，对党对人民犯下了滔天罪行。
    无限忠于伟大领袖毛主席的鞍山工人阶级和广大革命群众，在中国人民解放军鞍山驻军和三一七四部队的坚决支持下，团结一致，英勇奋战，同一小撮反革命修正主义分子进行了反复较量和顽强的搏斗，彻底粉碎了阶级敌人的种种阴谋，为鞍山的无产阶级文化大革命建立了丰功伟绩。
    喜看今日鞍山，革命洪流滚滚向前，工农业生产蒸蒸日上。伟大的毛泽东思想从来没有象今天这样深入人心，人们的无产阶级觉悟从来没有象今天这样高。到处是活学活用毛泽东思想的课堂，到处是斗私批修的战场。全市各种类型的毛泽东思想学习班已经办了八千一百多期，参加学习的已有四十四万多人。革命大批判正在步步深入。革命大联合和革命三结合越来越巩固和发展。全市各条战线已有八百多个单位建立了革命委员会或革命领导小组。鞍山钢铁公司所属各厂矿，除一个单位外，现在都已经建立了革命委员会。无产阶级文化大革命有力地推动了工农业生产。鞍钢生产水平不断上升，生产新纪录不断涌现。
    鞍山市革命委员会诞生后，遵照伟大领袖毛主席“千万不要忘记阶级斗争”的教导和光辉的最新指示，率领全市工人阶级和革命人民继续狠抓两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的斗争，狠抓革命的大批判，向中国赫鲁晓夫及其在鞍山的代理人不停顿地展开进攻，彻底肃清他们散布的一系列反革命修正主义流毒，把当前这场无产阶级反对资产阶级和一切剥削阶级的政治大革命进行到底。鞍山工人阶级和广大革命群众表示，决心在市革命委员会的领导下，更高地举起毛泽东思想的伟大红旗，乘胜前进，发展大好形势，从思想上、政治上、经济上、组织上夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利！
