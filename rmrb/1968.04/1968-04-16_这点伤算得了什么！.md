This little injury is nothing!

The winter days are so short! To rebuild the homeland, we need to extend the daylight and shorten the nights. Time is so precious.

“Work at night!”

“Build walls with lanterns!”

There are too few electric lights, so torches are lit on the roads and in the courtyards. A member of the Kolenja Village Agricultural Collective, Ali Buz, said, “Those who have electric lights at home should bring them out for everyone to use for construction.”

“Yes! I volunteer first. We will all bring out our electric lights for collective lighting. We will resolutely respond to the Party’s call and rebuild Kolenja Village in one month!” Mark, a mason from the village, eagerly responded to this initiative.

Following his lead, the streets and alleys of the mountain village were brightly lit, and the labor to rebuild the homeland proceeded tensely in the cold winter nights. Mark had worked as a mason in the port of Durres for many years. Recently, due to a work injury, his leg was severely injured. The doctor had given him a leave note, but when he heard that a strong earthquake had struck Debar, he hurried back to Kolenja Village with his bandaged leg to help his fellow villagers build walls and roofs. The wound was very painful, but he refused to leave the construction site. The biting cold wind sometimes numbed his leg, but thinking of the class brothers whose houses had collapsed, he felt a surge of strength throughout his body.

“Mark, you should rest! Your leg wound hasn’t healed yet!”

“No! This little injury is nothing!”

After work, he returned home. His house was one of the few in the village that had not collapsed. He let the neighbors live in the warm main room, while he and his family slept in another drafty corridor.

Every day, as soon as it was light, he would drag his painful leg to go build walls. (Accompanying picture)

Comrade Enver Hoxha came to the earthquake-stricken area of Debar and worked with the farmers who had volunteered for labor.

### “这点伤算得了什么！”

    “这点伤算得了什么！”
    深冬，白天是多么短啊！为了重建家园，多么需要把白天加长，把夜晚缩短，时间实在是太少了。
    “夜晚施工！”
    “带灯砌墙！”
    电灯太少，道路上，院子里点起了火把。科莱尼亚村农业社社员阿里·布兹说：“家里有电灯的请拿出来供大家施工用。”
    “对呀！我第一个报名。我们全把电灯拉出来，为集体照明。坚决响应劳动党的号召，我们一定要在一个月里重新建设出一个科莱尼亚村！”本村的泥瓦工人马尔克坚决响应这一倡议。
    在他的带动下，山村的大街小巷，到处灯火通明，重建家园的劳动在寒风凛冽的冬夜中紧张进行。马尔克在都拉斯海港当过多年的泥瓦工人，最近因为一次工伤事故，腿受了重伤。本来医生给他开了证明，让他休息，但是他一听说迪勃拉发生了强烈的地震，就赶忙拖着扎着绷带的伤腿赶回到科莱尼亚村来，帮助乡亲们砌墙盖房。伤口很疼，但是他怎么也不肯离开工地。刺骨的寒风刺得他有时腿都麻木了，但是一想到那些房屋倒塌的阶级弟兄，全身就涌出了一股力量。
    “马尔克，你还是歇歇吧！腿上的伤口还未好呢！”
    “不！我这么一点伤算得了什么！”
    收工后，他回到家里。他的房子是全村没有震倒的几所房屋中的一所。他把温暖的正屋让给了邻居们住，自己和一家老小睡在另一间透风的过道里。
    每天都是这样：天一亮，他就拖着疼痛的腿赶着去砌墙了。（附图片）
