The Colombian Communist Party (Marxist-Leninist) has recently published two brilliant works by the great teacher of the proletariat, Chairman Mao: "The Chinese Revolution and the Chinese Communist Party" and "Analysis of the Classes in Chinese Society."

In the preface to these two brilliant works, the Central Executive Committee of the Colombian Communist Party (Marxist-Leninist) pointed out that Mao Zedong Thought is contemporary Marxism-Leninism. It emphasized that only under the guidance of contemporary Marxism-Leninism—Mao Zedong Thought—can the revolutionary people of Colombia thoroughly defeat American imperialism and its running dogs.

The Central Executive Committee of the Colombian Communist Party (Marxist-Leninist) called on "the party's leading organs, party members, and revolutionary masses to deeply study Chairman Mao's works." It urged that in the process of study, they should link up with the revolutionary practice in Colombia and deeply understand Mao Zedong Thought in the actual struggle of the revolution.

	Tokyo, April 4—The brilliant military works of the great teacher of the proletariat, Chairman Mao, "Military Affairs Six Articles," have recently been published in Japanese by the Oriental Bookstore.

	"The Military Affairs Six Articles" are divided into two volumes, collecting Chairman Mao's brilliant works: "Problems of Strategy in China's Revolutionary War," "Strategic Problems of Guerrilla Warfare Against Japan," "On Protracted War," "Problems of War and Strategy," "Concentrate a Superior Force to Defeat the Enemy in Detail," and ten military principles excerpted from "The Present Situation and Our Tasks." Additionally, it includes Chairman Mao's quotations on people's war.

	The cover of the first volume of "The Military Affairs Six Articles" in Japanese features Chairman Mao's great teaching: "The central task and highest form of revolution is to seize political power through armed struggle, to solve problems through war. This Marxist-Leninist revolutionary principle is universally correct, whether in China or abroad, it is universally correct."

	The publisher emphasized that Chairman Mao, in the long practice of the Chinese revolution, has comprehensively developed the strategic and tactical theories of Marxism-Leninism.

	"The Military Affairs Six Articles" in two volumes are the fifth and sixth volumes of the series "Selected Works of Mao Zedong" published by the Oriental Bookstore. Previously, the Oriental Bookstore has published collections of Chairman Mao's works, including "On Literature and Art," "Four Philosophical Articles," and "On Party Construction."

	Rio de Janeiro, April 2—Recently, a "Mao Zedong Thought Study Group" in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, has reprinted Chairman Mao's brilliant work "Where Do Correct Ideas Come From?" into Portuguese.

	In the preface, the reprinting group highly praised Chairman Mao's work, saying, "It is a brilliant revolutionary teaching, a great and brilliant contribution to the dialectical materialist theory of knowledge." The preface stated that the "Mao Zedong Thought Study Group" joyfully calls on the revolutionary people and students of Brazil to study and apply this work.

	Previously, this "Mao Zedong Thought Study Group" in Rio de Janeiro had also reprinted and published three brilliant works by Chairman Mao: "In Memory of Norman Bethune," "Serve the People," and "The Foolish Old Man Who Removed the Mountains." They called on revolutionaries to study these three works as mottos for establishing a communist worldview.
