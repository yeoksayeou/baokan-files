Chairman Mao, our great teacher, has provided the most profound explanation of the great significance of the Cultural Revolution in his latest instructions. He has also brilliantly revealed the class content of the Cultural Revolution. The entire nation, both military and civilian, is earnestly studying Chairman Mao's wise instructions. They are determined to further raise their consciousness of class struggle and ideological struggle, to defeat factionalism, sectarianism, and right-wing splittism, to oppose two-faced individuals, to resolutely strike down the right-wing reversal trend, to carry out a thorough and sustained revolutionary criticism, to completely smash all the evil plots of the class enemy to shake and split the proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao, to follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, and to achieve a comprehensive victory in the Cultural Revolution.

	The New China News Agency reported on April 10 that Chairman Mao recently pointed out profoundly: "The Cultural Revolution of the proletariat is, in essence, a political revolution of the proletariat against the bourgeoisie and all exploiting classes under socialist conditions. It is the continuation of the long struggle between the Communist Party of China and the reactionary Kuomintang, led by the Communist Party and the broad revolutionary masses. It is the continuation of the class struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie." Revolutionary masses and revolutionary groups across the country, celebrating the establishment of the Revolutionary Committee in Chairman Mao's hometown of Hunan Province, saw the editorial in the People's Daily and the Liberation Army Daily conveying Chairman Mao's latest instructions, and received tremendous education and inspiration.

	The arrival of Chairman Mao's latest wise instructions and the good news of the establishment of the Revolutionary Committee in Hunan Province has brought joy to the entire nation. Revolutionary masses across the country pointed out that the unprecedented Cultural Revolution of the proletariat has achieved decisive victories, and the current national situation is excellent and getting better. Chairman Mao's latest wise instructions have profoundly explained the great significance of the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat and brilliantly revealed the class content of the Cultural Revolution, which is the greatest encouragement and education for the revolutionary people of the entire nation. The glorious victories achieved by Hunan Province and the revolutionary people of the entire nation in the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat are all the results of struggles against the class enemy under the guidance of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. They expressed their determination to deeply understand Chairman Mao's brilliant latest instructions, to further raise their consciousness of class struggle and ideological struggle, to defeat factionalism, sectarianism, and right-wing splittism, to oppose two-faced individuals, to resolutely strike down the right-wing reversal trend, to completely smash all the evil plots of the class enemy to shake and split the proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao, to follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, to implement Chairman Mao's series of latest instructions, and to achieve a comprehensive victory in the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat in terms of ideology, politics, economy, and organization.

	Revolutionary groups and revolutionary masses in Beijing, Shanghai, Tianjin, Guangdong, Hubei, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Guizhou, Fujian, and other places, while celebrating the birth of the Revolutionary Committee in Hunan Province, have studied Chairman Mao's latest instructions and have a deeper understanding of the sharpness, complexity, and long-term nature of class struggle under socialist conditions. Revolutionary masses expressed their determination to always remember Chairman Mao's great teaching of "never forget class struggle," to be highly vigilant, to focus on the struggle between the two classes, the two roads, and the two lines, to carry out a thorough and sustained revolutionary criticism, and to launch a sustained and proactive attack on the handful of capitalist roaders within the party led by China's Khrushchev and their agents and representatives in various places and all class enemies. They must be good at distinguishing between contradictions among the people and contradictions between the enemy and us. For the enemy, we must strike accurately, fiercely, and steadily. For our own people, for revolutionary comrades who have made mistakes, whether they are revolutionary masses or revolutionary cadres, we must help them rectify their errors, learn from the past, and cure the illness to save the patient.

	The arrival of Chairman Mao's extremely important latest instructions and the good news of the establishment of the Revolutionary Committee in Hunan Province has prompted the revolutionary groups and revolutionary masses in factories, rural areas, institutions, and schools in the capital to immediately organize study sessions and discussions. Representatives attending the First Conference of Active Learners and Appliers of Chairman Mao's Works on the Industrial, Commercial, and Construction Fronts in Beijing expressed their deep proletarian feelings of love and loyalty to the great leader Chairman Mao, and earnestly studied Chairman Mao's latest instructions. An old worker representative from the Mucity Coal Mine angrily said that China's Khrushchev is the representative of the handful of capitalist roaders within the party, the remnants of landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists, and the remnants of the reactionary Kuomintang within the Communist Party. China's Khrushchev and the handful of capitalist roaders within the party want to make the Chinese people suffer twice and endure twice the hardships, which we firmly oppose. They expressed their determination to further carry out revolutionary criticism, to defeat the right-wing reversal trend, to mobilize a broader range of revolutionary workers, revolutionary cadres, and their families to join this political revolution against the bourgeoisie and all exploiting classes, to thoroughly criticize and expose China's Khrushchev and his agents, and to ensure that they never rise again. The Revolutionary Committee of Shanghai held an expanded meeting today to earnestly study Chairman Mao's latest instructions. Everyone pointed out in the study that Chairman Mao's latest instructions have profoundly and comprehensively summarized the great significance of the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat and have once again pointed out the direction for our victorious advance. Workers from the Jiangnan Shipyard and the Shanghai Port, who have long struggled against imperialism and the reactionary Kuomintang, linked their unit's class struggle to express their determination to always remember the struggle between the two classes, the two roads, and the two lines, to consolidate our proletarian revolutionary regime in the continuous struggle against the class enemy, and to build the entire Shanghai into a red school of Mao Zedong Thought. Some leading members of the Revolutionary Committee of Tianjin expressed that Chairman Mao's wise instructions have further raised our consciousness of class struggle and ideological struggle. Old workers in Tanggu New Port expressed at a celebration meeting for the establishment of the Revolutionary Committee in Hunan Province that they must always remember class struggle and proletarian dictatorship, and under the guidance of the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, they will carry out this great political revolution to the end.

	More than ten thousand military and civilian personnel in Guangdong Province and Guangzhou City held a grand celebration today to warmly celebrate the birth of the Revolutionary Committee in Hunan Province. A responsible person from the Revolutionary Committee of Guangdong Province said at the meeting that they must follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment like the revolutionary people of Hunan, to further implement Chairman Mao's series of latest instructions, to resolutely strike down the right-wing reversal trend, to defeat factionalism, sectarianism, and right-wing splittism, to defend the proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao with their lives, to firmly support the People's Liberation Army, and to maintain the Revolutionary Committee with all their strength. The Revolutionary Committee of Hubei Province specially held a meeting to repeatedly study Chairman Mao's latest instructions. The responsible person of the Provincial Revolutionary Committee expressed at the meeting that they must hold high the great red flag of Mao Zedong Thought, to further carry out a thorough and sustained revolutionary criticism, to consolidate and develop the great alliance and the three-in-one combination, to do a good job in the struggle, criticism, and transformation of their units, and to carry out the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat to the end.

	The responsible person of the Revolutionary Committee of Jiangsu Province emphasized that the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat, personally initiated and led by Chairman Mao, has achieved great victories, but the class enemy will not be willing to accept their failure. They must root out the traitors, spies, and stubborn capitalist roaders who have infiltrated the party, and the counter-revolutionary two-faced individuals who have infiltrated the revolutionary ranks. No matter how the class enemy hides or is cunning, we have the invincible ideological weapon of Mao Zedong Thought and will definitely achieve a comprehensive victory in the Cultural Revolution. The responsible person of the Revolutionary Committee of Zhejiang Province pointed out at today's celebration meeting that Zhejiang is on the front line of national defense and was the old lair of Chiang Kai-shek before liberation, and the class struggle is very sharp and complex. They must be highly vigilant and give a fatal blow to the class enemy who tries to sabotage the Cultural Revolution. Members attending the expanded meeting of the Revolutionary Committee of Guizhou Province pointed out that the practice of class struggle has completely proven the wisdom and greatness of Chairman Mao's latest instructions. They must combine the actual class struggle of their regions and units, to focus on revolutionary criticism, and to carry out the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat to the end. Revolutionary groups and revolutionary masses in the coastal defense front of Fuzhou and in Liaoning, Shaanxi, Anhui, Yunnan, Xinjiang, Tibet, and other places expressed their determination to learn from the proletarian revolutionary groups in Chairman Mao's hometown of Hunan, to always remember class struggle and proletarian dictatorship, to defend the proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao with their lives, to defend Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line with their lives, and to achieve a comprehensive victory in the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat.

	The Revolutionary Committees or Revolutionary Preparation Small Groups of Beijing, Shanghai, Tianjin, Heilongjiang, Jilin, Hebei, Inner Mongolia, Shanxi, Shandong, Guizhou, Zhejiang, Jiangxi, Henan, Hubei, Guangdong, Gansu, Qinghai, Ningxia, Guangxi, Sichuan, and other provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions all sent telegrams today to warmly congratulate the birth of the Revolutionary Committee in Hunan Province. Revolutionary masses across the country expressed their determination to learn from the heroic revolutionary people of Hunan, to follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, to further implement Chairman Mao's series of latest instructions, to consolidate and develop the great alliance and the three-in-one combination, to do a good job in the struggle, criticism, and transformation of their units, to resolutely implement Chairman Mao's great policy of "grasp revolution, promote production," to resolutely respond to Chairman Mao's great call of "support the army and love the people," to strengthen military-civilian unity, and to achieve a comprehensive victory in the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat.

	The New China News Agency reported on April 10 that the broad cadres and fighters of the People's Liberation Army, while celebrating the birth of the Revolutionary Committee in Hunan Province, with unlimited loyalty to the great leader Chairman Mao, earnestly studied and deeply understood Chairman Mao's latest instructions: "The Cultural Revolution of the proletariat is, in essence, a political revolution of the proletariat against the bourgeoisie and all exploiting classes under socialist conditions. It is the continuation of the long struggle between the Communist Party of China and the reactionary Kuomintang, led by the Communist Party and the broad revolutionary masses. It is the continuation of the class struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie." They unanimously expressed their determination to remember Chairman Mao's great teaching, to strengthen their consciousness of class struggle, to raise their consciousness of ideological struggle, to join the people of the entire nation, to resolutely smash all the sabotage activities of the class enemy, to strengthen the dictatorship of the proletariat, and to achieve a comprehensive victory in the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat.

	Today, the entire army is in high spirits. From airports to docks, from frontline positions, border outposts to the "three supports and two military" frontlines, broad cadres and fighters have repeatedly listened to the editorial "The Sun Shines Over the Land of Hibiscus" in the People's Daily and the Liberation Army Daily, and have studied the editorial conveying Chairman Mao's latest instructions over and over again. The General Departments, various military branches, and the Beijing, Shenyang, Guangzhou, Nanjing, Jinan, Wuhan, Chengdu, Lanzhou, Kunming, Fuzhou troops, and the Xinjiang and Tibet Military Regions have held discussions and talks, and have extensively discussed the great significance of Chairman Mao's latest instructions and the excellent situation of the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat. Some units have immediately convened party committee meetings or expanded party committee meetings to make decisions on studying Chairman Mao's latest instructions. Some units have also sent Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams to go deep into factories, rural areas, schools, and streets to propagate Chairman Mao's latest instructions to the broad revolutionary masses.

	Broad cadres and fighters, while studying Chairman Mao's latest instructions, unanimously believed that Chairman Mao's latest instructions have profoundly pointed out the great significance of the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat and revealed the class content of the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat.

	The soldiers of the "model platoon for supporting the left and loving the people," the supporting left personnel of the 834th Unit stationed in the Beijing Knitting Factory, and the cadres and fighters of the People's Armed Department in Zizhong City, Sichuan Province, reviewed the class struggle they had experienced while performing the "three supports and two military" tasks and deeply felt that this Cultural Revolution of the proletariat, as Chairman Mao taught, is a political revolution of the proletariat against the bourgeoisie and all exploiting classes, is the continuation of the long struggle between the Communist Party of China and the reactionary Kuomintang, led by the Communist Party and the broad revolutionary masses, and is the continuation of the class struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie. We revolutionary soldiers are soldiers of class struggle. We must always remember Chairman Mao's teaching of "never forget class struggle" and carry out the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat to the end. Many cadres and fighters in various places pointed out in discussions that the closer the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat is to a comprehensive victory, the more the counter-revolutionary forces will fight to the death with the revolutionary forces. We must be highly vigilant, strengthen our enemy awareness, keep our eyes open, and be ready at any time to smash their various plots. The cadres and fighters of the Mao Zedong Thought propaganda team stationed at the Benxi Niutaitai Coal Mine said that China's Khrushchev and the handful of capitalist roaders within the party represent the interests of the reactionary Kuomintang, that is, the bourgeoisie and the landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists, and their goal is to restore capitalism in our country. To make these class enemies never rise again, we must thoroughly criticize the counter-revolutionary revisionist line they promote. Representatives attending the conferences of active learners and appliers of Mao Zedong Thought in the Jinan, Wuhan, Kunming, and other troops, the active learner of Mao Zedong Thought in the entire army, Huang Zushi, the "iron soldier" of the Railway Corps, Zhang Chunyu, and the former platoon leader of Liu Yingjun, Hou Caijun, all expressed in the study of Chairman Mao's latest instructions that they would join the people of the entire nation to hold high the great red flag of Mao Zedong Thought, to carry out a thorough and sustained revolutionary criticism, and to continue to launch an attack on the handful of capitalist roaders within the party led by China's Khrushchev and their agents.

	Broad cadres and fighters, while celebrating the birth of the Revolutionary Committee in Hunan Province, warmly praised the thorough revolutionary spirit of the heroic sons and daughters of Hunan who are loyal to Chairman Mao. They expressed their determination to further do a good job in the "three supports and two military" work, to unite with the broad revolutionary masses, to follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, to further implement Chairman Mao's series of latest instructions, and to achieve new victories in the great struggle to achieve a comprehensive victory in the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat.
