China's "Yao Hua" Ship Makes First Visit to Tanzania; Vice President Kawawa Attends Reception and Meets Chinese Technical Personnel; Chinese Government Donates Jeeps to Mali

	NEW DELHI, April 14 (Xinhua) — Tanzanian Vice President Kawawa and 500 guests attended a reception held by China's Chargé d'Affaires ad interim Zhou Boqing on the Chinese ocean liner "Yao Hua" on the evening of April 13.

	The 12,000-ton ocean liner arrived at the port of Dar es Salaam, the largest port in East Africa, on the evening of April 12. The first batch of Chinese technical personnel for the Tanzania-Zambia Railway survey and design team and members of the Chinese medical team dispatched to Tanzania arrived with the "Yao Hua."

	On the evening of April 13, the "Yao Hua," moored in Dar es Salaam, was brightly lit. The national flags of China and Tanzania flew high on the masts, and banners were hung on the deck, reading "Long Live the Invincible Thought of Mao Zedong!" and "Long Live China-Tanzania Friendship!"

	Attending the reception were some Tanzanian government ministers, deputy ministers, leaders of the Tanganyika African National Union, prominent figures from various sectors, diplomats from friendly countries, and chiefs of nationalist organizations from Southern Africa stationed in Dar es Salaam.

	Accompanied by the Chinese Chargé d'Affaires ad interim and the ship's captain, Tanzanian Vice President Kawawa toured the ship and met with the heads of the Chinese railway survey and design team and the Chinese medical team. He had a friendly conversation with them. Kawawa told them, "The Tanzanian people need you."

	One Tanzanian friend said, "We Tanzanians are very happy about the arrival of Chinese experts. This is a heavy blow to the imperialists who are hostile to Tanzania-China friendship."

	Many Tanzanian friends and other African friends eagerly asked Chinese crew members for Mao Zedong badges and "Quotations from Chairman Mao Zedong," and took photos in front of Mao Zedong's portrait in the ship's lounge as souvenirs.

	According to a report from Bamako on April 13, the handover ceremony for 30 "Beijing" jeeps manufactured in China, donated by the Chinese government to the Malian government, was held in Bamako, the capital of Mali. Liu Helin, Chargé d'Affaires ad interim of the Chinese Embassy in Mali, on behalf of the Chinese government, handed over the vehicles to the Malian government representative, Secretary of State for Rural Economy, Energy, and Industry at the Presidency, Sara Niar.

	Sara Niar said in his speech at the handover ceremony, "The people of my country sincerely thank the great Chinese people for their significant and effective assistance in all aspects." He emphasized that the Malian people are pleased to have the consistent support of the Chinese people, who are armed with the great thought of Mao Zedong. This time, the Chinese people have again provided valuable assistance to help Mali develop its rural economy.

	The Malian government will use these vehicles in agricultural areas.

    这艘一万二千吨的远洋轮船于十二日晚首次到达这个东非最大的港口达累斯萨拉姆港。随“耀华”轮到达的有第一批中国坦桑尼亚—赞比亚铁路勘察和设计小组的工程技术人员和中国派往坦桑尼亚的医疗队队员。
    十三日晚，停泊在达累斯萨拉姆港的“耀华”轮上灯火通明，中国和坦桑尼亚的国旗在桅杆上高高飘扬，轮船甲板上空，悬挂着横幅标语，上面写着“战无不胜的毛泽东思想万岁！”“中国—坦桑尼亚人民友好万岁！”
    出席招待会的还有坦桑尼亚的一些政府部长、副部长、坦噶尼喀非洲民族联盟领导人以及各界知名人士、友好国家的外交使节和非洲南部各民族主义组织驻达累斯萨拉姆的首席代表。
