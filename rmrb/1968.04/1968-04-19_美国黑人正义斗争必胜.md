Our great teacher Chairman Mao issued a statement on April 16 supporting the struggle of American blacks against violence. This is a document of great historical significance in Marxism-Leninism. We enthusiastically hail the publication of this brilliant document.

Chairman Mao's statement expresses the resolute support of 700 million Chinese people for the struggle of American blacks, points out the direction for the struggle of American blacks for freedom and liberation, and calls on all the people of the world to launch a sustained and fierce offensive against U.S. imperialism and its lackeys. This statement, not only for American blacks and the American people, but also for all the revolutionary people of the world, is a great encouragement. It will undoubtedly have an immeasurable and profound impact on the world revolutionary movement of our time.

Since August 1963, when Chairman Mao issued the statement "Support the Just Struggle of American Blacks Against U.S. Imperialism's Racial Discrimination," the struggle of American blacks has made great progress. Recently, American blacks have launched a new storm of resistance against violence, the scale of which and the intensity of the struggle are unprecedented in American history. It shows the further awakening of American blacks and reflects the further sharpening of class struggle within the United States.

In recent years, the revolutionary struggles of the people of the world have been surging, the Vietnamese people's war of resistance against American aggression for national salvation has achieved great victories, the dollar crisis has worsened, contradictions among imperialists have been intensifying, and U.S. imperialism's policy of aggression has suffered heavy defeats, falling into a desperate situation. To save itself from failure, U.S. imperialism is carrying out frenzied aggression abroad and strengthening its attacks on American blacks and the broad masses of laboring people at home. This cannot but provoke strong resistance from the American people, especially American blacks. The unprecedented struggle storm launched by American blacks is a prominent manifestation of the current political and economic crises of U.S. imperialism. And the struggle of American blacks will inevitably promote the struggle of all oppressed and exploited American people against the brutal rule of the American monopoly capitalist class, further deepening the political and economic crises of U.S. imperialism.

In his statement, Chairman Mao points out: "Racial discrimination in the United States is a product of colonialism and imperialism. The contradiction between the broad masses of American blacks and the ruling clique of the United States is a class contradiction. Only by overthrowing the reactionary rule of the American monopoly capitalist class and destroying the system of colonialism and imperialism can American blacks achieve thorough liberation." This important thesis put forward by Chairman Mao points out the class roots of the oppression suffered by American blacks and the fundamental goal of their struggle for freedom and liberation, which has great theoretical and practical significance for the American black movement, providing a powerful ideological weapon for the broad masses of American blacks who are in struggle.

The struggle of American blacks for liberation is, in the final analysis, a class struggle. The oppressors of blacks are the American monopoly capitalist class. The system of racial discrimination is not only an important means by which the American monopoly capitalist class cruelly oppresses and exploits the broad masses of blacks, but also an important means by which it divides the oppressed classes in the United States to maintain its reactionary rule.

The American monopoly capitalist class will never give up racial discrimination against blacks. The ruling clique of the United States plays tricks like the "Civil Rights Act," not to abolish this evil system, but to maintain this evil system. The American monopoly capitalist class is the common enemy of all oppressed and exploited people in the United States. The struggle of American blacks for liberation must necessarily combine with the American workers' movement. The day the reactionary rule of the American monopoly capitalist class ends is the day American blacks achieve thorough liberation.

The ruling clique of the United States is trying every means to lead the American black movement down the path of "non-violence." However, it itself always uses counter-revolutionary violence to brutally persecute blacks. In this way, it often plays the role of a negative teacher.

Recently, the American black pastor Martin Luther King Jr., who advocated "non-violence," was assassinated, and black masses were savagely suppressed by tens of thousands of reactionary military police, once again deeply educating the broad masses of blacks: only by using revolutionary violence to resist counter-revolutionary violence can they achieve liberation.

At present, the revolutionary people of the world are engaged in a fierce struggle against U.S. imperialism and its lackeys. The struggle of American blacks for freedom and liberation is a front opened within the United States against U.S. imperialism, a component of the world revolution of our time. The struggle of American blacks and the revolutionary struggles of the peoples of various countries are mutually supportive, mutually inspiring, and mutually promoting. The people of the world further unite and strengthen their struggles, and they will surely bury U.S. imperialism and all monsters. As the great leader Chairman Mao has pointed out: "It can be affirmed that the thorough collapse of colonialism, imperialism, and all systems of exploitation is not far off, and the thorough liberation of all oppressed peoples and oppressed nations is not far off." Chairman Mao's scientific prediction will surely be realized, and it will be realized.

In the imperialist lair of Washington, black masses are fiercely opposing the reactionary rule of the American monopoly capitalist class, turning the capital of this number one imperialist country into a battlefield of smoke and rubble.

    美国黑人正义斗争必胜
    谷平
    我们伟大的导师毛主席四月十六日发表了《支持美国黑人抗暴斗争的声明》。这是一个具有伟大历史意义的马克思列宁主义的文件。我们热烈欢呼这个光辉文件的发表。
    毛主席的声明，表达了七亿中国人民对美国黑人斗争的坚决支持，指明了美国黑人争取自由解放斗争的方向，并且号召全世界人民向美帝国主义及其帮凶们发动持久的猛烈的进攻。这个声明，不仅对于美国黑人和美国人民，而且对全世界革命人民，是一个极大的鼓舞。它对当代世界革命运动必将产生不可估量的深远影响。
    自从一九六三年八月，毛主席发表《支持美国黑人反对美帝国主义种族歧视的正义斗争的声明》以来，美国黑人的斗争有了很大的发展。最近，美国黑人掀起了抗暴斗争的新风暴，其规模之大，斗争之激烈，是美国历史上从来没有过的。它显示了美国黑人的进一步觉醒，反映了美国国内阶级斗争的进一步尖锐化。
    近年来，世界人民革命斗争日益高涨，越南人民抗美救国战争取得伟大胜利，美元危机严重恶化，帝国主义之间的矛盾不断加剧，美帝国主义的侵略政策遭到惨重失败，陷入走投无路的绝境。美帝国主义为了挽救它的失败，在国外进行疯狂的侵略，在国内加强对美国黑人和广大劳动人民的进攻。这就不能不引起美国人民，特别是美国黑人的强烈反抗。这次美国黑人掀起的规模空前的斗争风暴，就是当前美帝国主义整个政治危机和经济危机的一个突出表现。而美国黑人的斗争，又必然会推动整个被剥削、被压迫的美国人民反对美国垄断资产阶级残暴统治的斗争，使美帝国主义的政治危机和经济危机进一步加深。
    毛主席在声明中指出：“美国的种族歧视，是殖民主义、帝国主义制度的产物。美国广大黑人同美国统治集团之间的矛盾，是阶级矛盾。只有推翻美国垄断资产阶级的反动统治，摧毁殖民主义、帝国主义制度，美国黑人才能够取得彻底解放。”毛主席提出的这个重要论点，指出了美国黑人遭受压迫的阶级根源和黑人争取自由解放斗争的根本目标，对于美国黑人运动具有重大理论意义和实践意义，给了正在斗争中的美国广大黑人群众以强大的思想武器。
    美国黑人争取解放的斗争，归根到底是阶级斗争。压迫黑人的，是美国垄断资产阶级。种族歧视制度不仅是美国垄断资产阶级残酷压迫和剥削广大黑人群众的一个重要手段，也是它分化美国被压迫阶级、维护其反动统治的一个重要手段。
    美国垄断资产阶级绝对不可能放弃对黑人的种族歧视。美国统治集团玩弄“民权法案”之类的花招，根本不是为了废除这种罪恶制度，而是为了维护这种罪恶制度。美国垄断资产阶级是美国整个被压迫、被剥削人民的共同敌人。美国黑人争取解放的斗争，必然要同美国工人运动结合起来。美国垄断资产阶级的反动统治结束之日，就是美国黑人获得彻底解放之时。
    美国统治集团千方百计地企图把美国的黑人运动引向“非暴力主义”的歧途。但是，它自己却总是用反革命暴力对黑人进行残酷的迫害。这样，它就经常地起着反面教员的作用。
    最近，主张“非暴力主义”的美国黑人牧师马丁·路德·金被暗杀，黑人群众遭到几万反动军警的野蛮镇压，再一次深刻地教育了广大黑人：只有用革命的暴力来反对反革命的暴力，才能使自己得到解放。
    目前，全世界革命人民同美帝国主义及其帮凶，正在进行着一场激烈的大搏斗。美国黑人争取自由解放的斗争，是在美国国内开辟的一条反对美帝国主义的战线，是当代世界革命的一个组成部分。美国黑人斗争和世界各国人民的革命斗争，是互相支援、互相鼓舞、互相促进的。全世界人民进一步团结起来，加强斗争，就一定能够埋葬美帝国主义和一切妖魔鬼怪。正如伟大领袖毛主席所指出的：“可以肯定，殖民主义、帝国主义和一切剥削制度的彻底崩溃，世界上一切被压迫人民、被压迫民族的彻底翻身，已经为期不远了。”毛主席的这个科学预言，一定要实现，一定能够实现。（附图片）
    在美帝老巢华盛顿，黑人群众大造美国垄断资产阶级反动统治的反，把这个头号帝国主义国家的首都变成一个烟雾弥漫、瓦砾成堆的战场。
