Xiangfang Brigade's commune members persist in studying Chairman Mao's works during the busy spring plowing season.

The poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres of Xiangfang Brigade, Xingshou Commune, Changping County, Beijing, with deep proletarian feelings of loyalty to the great leader Chairman Mao, have adopted the method of "studying before work, reflecting during work, reciting while walking, and contemplating at night" to study and apply Chairman Mao's works. This has solved the problem of the contradiction between labor and study during the busy spring plowing season, overcome the phenomenon of theory and practice being disconnected, and promoted a revolutionary style of study that combines theory with practice. The brigade has seen new developments in both revolution and production.

	Studying Before Work

	The commune members of Xiangfang Brigade say: Study before work, Mao Zedong Thought etched in the heart. For the revolution, we till the land, the red sun never sets.

	Every day before going to work, all the commune members of Xiangfang Brigade, with hearts filled with boundless love, faith, admiration, and loyalty to the great leader Chairman Mao, stand before Chairman Mao's portrait, wishing Chairman Mao eternal life! They decide to fight on the most difficult frontlines. They study Chairman Mao's works in conjunction with their thoughts and work realities. For example, during a mountain blasting and stone clearing task, they first studied the essay "The Foolish Old Man Who Removed the Mountains." The glorious image of the "Foolish Old Man" stood before each person, and Chairman Mao's teachings of "firmly resolving to overcome all difficulties, not fearing sacrifice, and striving for victory" were etched in their hearts. Under the inspiration of the "Foolish Old Man" spirit, they successfully completed the task.

	Reflecting During Work

	The commune members say: Reflect during work, revolutionary enthusiasm soars high. Mao Zedong Thought illuminates the heart, boundless power surges forth.

	During intense labor, the commune members of Xiangfang Brigade place Chairman Mao's portrait and quotations from Chairman Mao in the fields. Chairman Mao's great image inspires the commune members' fighting spirit, and Chairman Mao's quotations boost their enthusiasm. During rest periods, the commune members take out the red revolutionary treasure, "Quotations from Chairman Mao," and compare their actions. When facing difficulties, they compare themselves to the "Foolish Old Man"; when having selfish thoughts, they compare themselves to Zhang Side and Norman Bethune. By reflecting and comparing, they examine whether they are loyal to Chairman Mao and whether they act in the public interest. The study guides of Chairman Mao's works often use revolutionary struggle history and heroic figures' stories to inspire the commune members' fighting spirit and use revolutionary songs to boost their enthusiasm. The commune members reflect: In the past, rest periods were spent arguing over work points, and there was no enthusiasm for work; now, rest periods are spent studying the revolutionary treasure, thinking of the revolution without fearing hardship.

	Reciting While Walking

	The commune members of Xiangfang Brigade, with the revolutionary spirit of "seizing the day," make use of the time walking to and from work to recite Chairman Mao's instructions. They say: Reciting Chairman Mao's affectionate teachings deepens understanding and makes execution more resolute. Squad leader Liu Shoulan said well: "Completely" and "thoroughly" recite, willing to be a Zhang Side; recite about "two extremes," selflessly serving others; recite about "struggling against selfishness and criticizing revisionism," being infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao. In the brigade, five elderly women were selected for seed sorting. In the past, five people could sort one bucket of seeds a day and still complained about the workload. After studying Chairman Mao's instructions on "grasping the revolution and promoting production," two people can sort one bucket a day, doubling the work efficiency. On the way back from work, when they discussed their experiences of applying Mao Zedong Thought, one elderly woman said: "Without studying Chairman Mao's works, I didn't know for whom I was working. After studying Chairman Mao's works, I knew I was working for the revolution. I no longer cared about work points, but thought about struggling against selfishness, criticizing revisionism, grasping the revolution, and promoting production. This way, the work was done well."

	Contemplating at Night

	After a day's labor, the commune members of Xiangfang Brigade return home, and the whole family sits under Chairman Mao's portrait, studying Chairman Mao's teachings on class and class struggle, recalling the bitterness of the past, and thinking about the sweetness of today. The central topic is to never forget class struggle, to never forget that the landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists are not reconciled to their demise, and to never forget the danger of the "self" enemy in one's mind. Brigade cadre Wang Yonghai, every day when he returns home, looks at Chairman Mao's portrait, thinks about Chairman Mao's teachings of "never forgetting class struggle," recalls the actions of class enemies, and is always alert to revolutionary vigilance. By doing so, they timely exposed and struck down the sabotage plots of class enemies.

    毛泽东思想刻心窝
    ——象坊大队社员春耕大忙季节坚持学习毛主席著作
    北京市昌平县兴寿公社象坊大队的贫下中农、革命干部，怀着无限忠于伟大领袖毛主席的深厚无产阶级感情，采取“工前学一学，劳动中间照一照，走路背一背，晚上想一想”的学习方法，活学活用毛主席著作，解决了春耕大忙季节劳动和学习时间矛盾的问题，克服了学用脱节现象，理论联系实际的革命学风得到大发扬，革命、生产出现了新气象。
    工前学一学
    象坊大队的社员们说：工前学一学，毛泽东思想刻心窝。社员为革命种田，一轮红日永不落。
    象坊大队全体社员在每天上工前，怀着对伟大领袖毛主席无限热爱、无限信仰、无限崇拜、无限忠诚的心情，站在毛主席像前，敬祝毛主席万寿无疆！决心到最困难的岗位上去战斗。他们结合思想实际、工作实际，选学毛主席著作。如在一次开山炸石时，他们首先学了《愚公移山》一文。“老愚公”的光辉形象站在每个人的面前，毛主席的“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利”的教导铭刻在他们心中。他们在“老愚公”精神鼓舞下，胜利完成了任务。
    劳动中间照一照
    社员们说：劳动中间照一照，革命干劲比天高。毛泽东思想照胸怀，无穷力量滚滚来。
    象坊大队的社员在紧张的劳动中，把毛主席像和毛主席语录牌插在田头。毛主席的伟大形象激励着社员的斗志，毛主席语录鼓舞着社员的干劲。工间休息时，社员们拿出红彤彤的革命宝书《毛主席语录》，对照自己的行动。困难时，和“老愚公”比一比；有私心时，和张思德、白求恩比一比。照一照，比一比，查出了对毛主席忠还是不忠，查出了是不是处处为公。毛主席著作学习辅导员，还经常用革命斗争史、英雄人物事迹鼓励社员们的斗志，用革命歌曲激发社员们的干劲。社员们反映说：过去休息争工分，干起活来没有劲；现在休息学宝书，心想革命不怕苦。
    走路背一背
    象坊大队的社员们以“只争朝夕”的革命精神，抓住上工和收工走路的时间，背诵毛主席的指示。他们说：背一背毛主席的亲切教导，理解深一步，执行起来就更坚决。指导员刘守兰说得好：“完全”、“彻底”背一背，愿做一个张思德；“两个极端”背一背，毫不利己专门利人；“斗私，批修”背一背，无限忠于毛主席。在大队选种的五位老大娘，过去五个人一天选一桶种子，还埋怨活多。学习了毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的指示，两个人一天选一桶，工效提高了一倍多。她们在收工的路上谈一天活学活用毛泽东思想的体会时，有一位老大娘说：“没有学毛主席著作，不知道为谁干，学了毛主席著作，知道为革命种田，心里不嘀咕工分了，想的是斗私批修，抓革命促生产，这活就干好了。”
        晚上想一想
    象坊大队的社员劳动一天回到了家，全家人坐在毛主席像下，学习毛主席关于阶级和阶级斗争的教导，回忆解放前的苦，想一想今日甜。中心议题就是不要忘记阶级斗争，不要忘记地、富、反、坏、右还不甘心死亡，不要忘记头脑中还有“私”字这个危险的敌人。大队干部王永海每天回到家里，都要看一看毛主席像，想一想毛主席的“千万不要忘记阶级斗争”的教导，回忆阶级敌人一天的举动，时刻提高革命警惕。他们这样做，及时识破和打击了阶级敌人的破坏阴谋。
    社员们反映说：晚上想一想，阶级斗争永不忘。（新华社）
