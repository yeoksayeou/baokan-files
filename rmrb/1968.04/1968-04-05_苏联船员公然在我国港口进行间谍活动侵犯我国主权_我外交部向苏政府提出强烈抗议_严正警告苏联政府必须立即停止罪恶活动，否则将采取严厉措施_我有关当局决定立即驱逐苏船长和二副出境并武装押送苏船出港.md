The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China today sent a note to the Soviet Embassy in China, strongly protesting against the criminal acts of espionage and violation of Chinese sovereignty by the second mate, Ponamarchuk, of the Soviet ship "Ukrainian Komsomol," and the serious illegal behavior of the ship's captain, Kosyakov.

The note states that on March 23, 1968, at 14:04, the Soviet ship "Ukrainian Komsomol" was on its way to the Tiger Gate from the garbage tail island in Guangzhou's Huangpu Port. The second mate, Ponamarchuk, secretly photographed the terrain of Chinese warships and the Tiger Gate fortress. When Chinese inspection personnel conducted the inspection, Ponamarchuk denied it and attempted to expose the film to destroy the evidence. Captain Kosyakov took an unacceptable attitude of shielding Ponamarchuk's criminal behavior, openly resisting the Chinese authorities' lawful detention and interrogation of the second mate, Ponamarchuk, and even incited the crew to provoke the relevant Chinese personnel, completely disregarding the dignity of Chinese law. During the "Ukrainian Komsomol's" stay in Huangpu Port, the captain also ignored repeated warnings from the Chinese side and repeatedly used the radio illegally, seriously violating Chinese port regulations.

The note points out that Soviet ships and crew members have long been conducting espionage activities in Chinese territorial waters. In July 1967 alone, the Soviet reconnaissance ships "Hydrographer" and "Hydrologist" entered the coastal waters of East China six times, blatantly violating the sovereignty of the People's Republic of China and threatening China's security. The Chinese side has repeatedly protested to the Soviet side, but the Soviet side has turned a deaf ear and continued these criminal activities. At a time when U.S. imperialism is further escalating the war in Vietnam, you, like U.S. imperialism, are actively conducting espionage activities in the rear of the Vietnamese people's struggle against U.S. aggression and for national salvation— the People's Republic of China. This clearly exposes the sinister purpose of the Soviet revisionist leadership in colluding with the United States to oppose China.

The note states that the Chinese government strongly protests against the criminal acts of espionage and violation of Chinese sovereignty by Soviet ships and crew members and sternly warns the Soviet government to immediately stop such criminal activities by Soviet ships and crew members in China. Otherwise, the Chinese government will take severe measures.

The note concludes by stating that relevant Chinese authorities have decided to immediately expel the second mate, Ponamarchuk, and the captain, Kosyakov, of the Soviet ship "Ukrainian Komsomol" from the country and prohibit them from entering Chinese ports in the future. The Soviet ship "Ukrainian Komsomol" will be escorted out of the port by Chinese armed forces.

The Guangzhou Huangpu Border Inspection Station today announced the decision regarding the handling of the second mate, Ponamarchuk, and the captain, Kosyakov, of the Soviet ship "Ukrainian Komsomol."

The decision, after announcing Ponamarchuk's espionage activities and violation of Chinese sovereignty and Kosyakov's serious illegal behavior, states that in order to safeguard the sovereignty of the People's Republic of China and uphold the dignity of Chinese laws and port regulations, it is decided:

1. To immediately expel the second mate, Ponamarchuk, and the captain, Kosyakov, of the Soviet ship "Ukrainian Komsomol" from the country and prohibit them from entering Chinese ports in the future;
2. To escort the Soviet ship "Ukrainian Komsomol" out of the port under armed guard;
3. To confiscate the camera and film used by the second mate, Ponamarchuk, in his criminal activities.

The above decision has been immediately executed.

    苏联船员公然在我国港口进行间谍活动侵犯我国主权
    我外交部向苏政府提出强烈抗议
    严正警告苏联政府必须立即停止罪恶活动，否则将采取严厉措施
    我有关当局决定立即驱逐苏船长和二副出境并武装押送苏船出港
    新华社四日讯　中华人民共和国外交部今天就苏联船“乌克兰共青团员”号二副波诺马尔楚克进行间谍活动、侵犯中国主权的罪恶行径和船长柯夏科夫的严重违法行为，照会苏联驻中国大使馆，向苏联政府提出强烈抗议。
    照会说，一九六八年三月二十三日十四时零四分，苏船“乌克兰共青团员”号在中国广州黄埔港垃圾尾岛进入虎门途中，这艘船的二副波诺马尔楚克窃摄我舰艇和虎门要塞的地形。当我检查人员进行检查时，波诺马尔楚克竟然矢口抵赖，并企图将所摄底片曝光灭迹。船长柯夏科夫对波诺马尔楚克的犯罪行为，采取了令人不能容忍的包庇态度，公然抗拒中国专政机关对二副波诺马尔楚克依法进行拘留审讯，而且还指使船员对我有关人员进行无理挑衅，完全无视中国法律的尊严。在“乌克兰共青团员”号停泊黄埔港期间，船长还不顾我方一再警告，多次非法使用电台发报，严重违犯我国港规。
    照会指出，苏联船只和船员早就在中国领水进行间谍活动。仅在一九六七年七月间，苏联侦察船“水文学家”号和“水道测量员”号就连续六次进入我华东沿海地区，进行间谍活动，明目张胆地侵犯中华人民共和国的主权，威胁我国的安全。中国方面曾不止一次地向苏联方面提出抗议，但是，苏联方面却充耳不闻，继续进行这种罪恶活动。正当美帝国主义在越南进一步扩大战争的时候，你们同美帝国主义一样，在越南人民抗美救国斗争的后方——中华人民共和国积极进行间谍活动，这就明显地暴露了苏修领导集团联美反华的罪恶目的。
    照会说，对于苏联船只和船员进行间谍活动、侵犯中国主权的罪恶行径，中国政府向苏联政府提出强烈抗议，并严正警告苏联政府必须立即停止苏联船只和船员在中国的这种罪恶活动，否则，中国政府将采取严厉的措施。
    照会最后说，中国有关当局决定，立即驱逐苏船“乌克兰共青团员”号二副波诺马尔楚克和船长柯夏科夫出境，今后不准再来中国港口，苏船“乌克兰共青团员”号由我武装押送出港。
    新华社广州四日电中国广州黄埔边防检查站今天宣布了关于对苏船
  “乌克兰共青团员”号二副波诺马尔楚克和船长柯夏科夫的处理决定。
    决定在宣布波诺马尔楚克进行间谍活动、侵犯中国主权的罪恶行径和柯夏科夫的严重违法行为后指出，为了维护中华人民共和国主权，维护我国法律和港规的尊严，特决定：
    一、立即驱逐苏船“乌克兰共青团员”号二副波诺马尔楚克和船长柯夏科夫出境，今后不准再来中国港口；
    二、武装押送苏船“乌克兰共青团员”号出港；
    三、没收二副波诺马尔楚克所使用的犯罪工具照相机和所摄底片。
    上述决定已立即执行。
