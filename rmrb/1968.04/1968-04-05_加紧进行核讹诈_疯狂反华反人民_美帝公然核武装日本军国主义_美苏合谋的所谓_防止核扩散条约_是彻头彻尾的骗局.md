The U.S. imperialists and their biggest accomplice in Asia, the reactionary Sato government of Japan, are hurrying to strengthen their nuclear military collusion. The new "U.S.-Japan Atomic Energy Cooperation Agreement" signed in Washington on February 26 this year is an important step for the U.S. and Japanese reactionaries to oppose China, invade other Asian countries, and further arm Japan with nuclear weapons.

According to this long-term agreement, which lasts for thirty years, the United States will provide Japan with 161 tons of enriched uranium-235. This amount is nearly sixty times more than the 2.7 tons specified in the ten-year agreement signed in 1958. The agreement also stipulates that the United States will provide Japan with 365 kilograms of plutonium by 1970, nearly fifty times more than the amount specified in the ten-year agreement. The scale of nuclear fuel provided by the United States to Japan is unprecedented in all the agreements it has signed with its vassal states so far.

Japanese bourgeois newspapers acknowledge that although this agreement is labeled as "peaceful use," these nuclear fuels can be processed for military purposes. A recent issue of the magazine "Diamond" states: "If uranium is enriched to 100 percent, it can be immediately used for atomic bombs." Meanwhile, the "Asahi Shimbun" also points out: "Plutonium can be used as nuclear explosive material."

The U.S. imperialists, who tightly bind Japan to their war chariot, are not only aiding and abetting Japanese militarism in nuclear armament but also tightening control over Japan's nuclear armament to make Japan their tame tool. The agreement superficially stipulates that "to prevent nuclear fuel from being used for military purposes," the "right to inspection and supervision" is held by the United States. If Japan exports nuclear fuel after processing it to a third country, it also requires "approval from the United States." In reality, this stipulates that the authority to develop nuclear weapons for Japan is to be held by the United States.

The target of this agreement between the U.S. and Japanese reactionaries is China. Just as the representatives of both sides were conspiring to sign this agreement in Washington, the head of the East Asia and Pacific Affairs Research and Analysis Section of the U.S. State Department's Bureau of Intelligence and Research, Green, admitted that for dealing with China, "the best method is to establish a joint U.S.-Japan nuclear warfare force at sea in the form of Japan participating in the management of the U.S. nuclear war force."

Last November, Japanese Prime Minister Sato Eisaku, who went to Washington to pay homage to the American master, also raved about China's "nuclear threat" and blatantly proposed to "create" conditions to prevent Asian countries from being "threatened" by China, scheming to further turn Japan into a nuclear war base for U.S. imperialism and to arm Japan with nuclear weapons. Subsequently, the Minister of Agriculture and Forestry, Kuraiwa, who was driven out of office amid the anger of the Japanese people, also blatantly raved that "Japan would be fine with 300,000 troops and atomic bombs."

The war cries of the U.S. and Japanese reactionaries have made the Japanese people, the Asian people, and the people of the world further realize that the "U.S.-Japan Atomic Energy Cooperation Agreement" signed under the guise of "peaceful use" is full of gunpowder. It shows that the so-called "Non-Proliferation Treaty" drafted by the U.S. imperialists and the Soviet revisionists in collusion is a complete fraud. The U.S. imperialists are doing everything they can to restrict countries that are subjected to aggression and threats by them and their accomplices from developing nuclear weapons for self-defense and the defense of peace, while they themselves are brazenly spreading nuclear weapons to their accomplice countries and establishing numerous nuclear bases aimed at China, in order to further promote their nuclear blackmail policy.

However, the conspiracy of the U.S. and Japanese reactionaries is doomed to fail. The great leader of the Chinese people, Chairman Mao, said: "The atomic bombs and hydrogen bombs in the hands of the U.S. imperialists cannot frighten all the people who do not want to be slaves. The surging tide of the people of the world against the U.S. aggressors is irresistible. The struggle of the people of the world against U.S. imperialism and its running dogs will certainly win even greater victories." The mad push by the U.S. and Japanese reactionaries to arm Japanese militarism with nuclear weapons will absolutely not frighten the Chinese people and the people of other Asian countries. The reactionary government of Japan and the militarist elements, following the U.S. imperialists to tread the old path of Tojo, will definitely not escape the severe punishment of the Japanese people, the Chinese people, and the people of the world.

    加紧进行核讹诈　疯狂反华反人民
    美帝公然核武装日本军国主义
    美苏合谋的所谓“防止核扩散条约”是彻头彻尾的骗局
    据新华社东京电　美帝国主义同它在亚洲的最大帮凶日本佐藤反动政府正在加紧核军事勾结。今年二月二十六日在华盛顿签订的新的“美日原子能合作协定”，就是美日反动派反对中国，侵略亚洲其他国家，进一步使日本核武装的一个重要步骤。
    根据这项为期三十年的长期协定，美国将向日本提供一百六十一吨浓缩铀235，这个数目比一九五八年签订的十年协定所规定的二点七吨，增加近六十倍。协定还规定，美国在一九七○年以前，将向日本提供钚三百六十五公斤，比为期十年的协定所规定的数目增加近五十倍。美国向日本提供核燃料的规模如此之大，这在美国至今同它的一些仆从国家签订的协定中是空前的。
    日本资产阶级报刊的评论承认，虽然这一协定标榜着“和平利用”，但是这些核燃料都是可以被加工用在军事方面的。不久之前出版的《钻石》杂志说：“如果把铀浓缩到百分之百，就可以立即用于原子弹。”同时《朝日新闻》也指出：“钚可以做为核爆炸原料”。
    紧紧地把日本捆在它的战车上的美帝国主义，在扶植日本军国主义进行核武装的同时，还加紧对日本核武装进行控制，以便使日本成为它的驯服工具。这项协定表面上装模作样地规定，“为了防止核燃料用于军事目的”，“检查监督的权利，由美国掌握”，日本如果把核燃料加工之后向第三国输出时，也要“美国的同意”。但实际上，这是规定日本发展核武器的大权，要由美国掌握。
    美日反动派的这项协定，其矛头是针对中国的。就在美日两方代表在华盛顿密谋签订这项协定的时候，美国国务院情报研究司东亚和太平洋问题研究分析科科长格林承认，美日双方为了对付中国，“最好的方法是以日本参加美国核战争力量的管理的形式，建立美日两国的海上核战争力量”。
    去年十一月到华盛顿朝拜美国主子的日本首相佐藤荣作，也疯狂叫嚷中国的“核威胁”，明目张胆地提出，要“制造”使亚洲国家不受中国“威胁”的“条件”，阴谋进一步把日本变成美帝国主义的核战争基地和使日本核武装。随后，在日本人民愤怒声中被赶下台的农林相仓石也公然叫嚣，日本“要有三十万军队和原子弹就好办了”。
    美日反动派的这些战争叫嚣使日本人民、亚洲人民和全世界人民进一步清楚地看到，在“和平利用”的幌子下签订的“美日原子能合作协定”充满了火药味。它表明，美帝国主义同苏修集团狼狈为奸炮制出来的所谓“防止核扩散条约”草案，是个彻头彻尾的骗局。美帝国主义千方百计地限制受到它和它的帮凶侵略和威胁的国家为了自卫和保卫和平而发展核武器，而它自己却放肆地向它的帮凶国家扩散核武器，建立大量针对中国的核基地，以便进一步推行它的核讹诈政策。
    但是，美日反动派的这一阴谋是绝对不能得逞的。中国人民的伟大领袖毛主席说过：“美帝国主义手里的原子弹、氢弹，是吓不倒一切不愿意做奴隶的人们的。全世界人民反对美国侵略者的怒潮是不可阻挡的。全世界人民反对美帝国主义及其走狗的斗争一定会取得更加伟大的胜利。”美日反动派疯狂地推进日本军国主义的核武装，绝对吓不倒中国人民和其他亚洲国家人民。日本反动政府和军国主义分子追随美帝国主义重走东条的老路，一定逃不掉日本人民、中国人民和全世界人民的严厉惩罚。
