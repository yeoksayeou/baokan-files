The Chinese Embassy in Burma on April 4 handed a note of protest to the Burmese government regarding the Burmese government's recent large-scale arrest of patriotic overseas Chinese in Burma, lodging a strong protest.

The note said: In the early hours of March 19, the Burmese government mobilized a large number of police and secret agents to carry out a sudden raid under the pretext of "checking household registrations" and "verifying identity cards," arresting a large number of patriotic overseas Chinese residing in Rangoon and various parts of Burma. Among those arrested in Rangoon alone, there are patriotic overseas Chinese leaders Chen Fushun and Li Jianyao, leaders of the Overseas Chinese Cultural Association Chen Lansheng and Yang Shuangxi, and overseas Chinese teachers Zhou Yabao and Ruan Danping, among dozens of others. The arrests of patriotic overseas Chinese in various parts of Burma are still continuing, and the personal freedom and safety of the broad masses of overseas Chinese are being seriously threatened.

The note pointed out: The Burmese government's blatant persecution of patriotic overseas Chinese is a wanton provocation against the Chinese people and a serious step to further deteriorate the relations between China and Burma. The Chinese Embassy in the People's Republic of China strongly protests against this to the Burmese government.

The note said: The Burmese government recently expelled the New China News Agency staff in Rangoon without reason, continuously and illegally interrogated and sentenced the arrested patriotic overseas Chinese. Now, the Burmese government is further arresting innocent overseas Chinese. At the same time, the Burmese media, under the instigation of the government, is intensifying anti-China propaganda, maliciously slandering China, and inciting anti-China sentiment. Obviously, the Burmese government is planning and systematically trying to launch another new wave of anti-China and anti-Chinese sentiment, with the same purpose as before, which is to cater to the needs of U.S. imperialism and Soviet revisionism and to intensify the suppression of the domestic people.

The note said: To cover up its unreasonable persecution of overseas Chinese, the Burmese government this time again used its usual tactics, slandering the arrested patriotic overseas Chinese as "violating Burmese laws" and "participating in activities that endanger Burmese national security and the welfare of the people." This slander is groundless. Overseas Chinese in Burma have always followed the teachings of the Chinese government, respected Burmese laws and Burmese people's customs and habits, lived in harmony with the Burmese people, and worked hard to promote friendly relations between the peoples of China and Burma. They have also actively supported the Burmese people's struggle to safeguard national independence. This is a well-known fact that the Burmese government's slander cannot erase. The Burmese government's slander only further exposes their arrogant and unreasonable anti-China and anti-Chinese reactionary face.

The note finally said: The Chinese Embassy solemnly demands that the Burmese government immediately release Chen Fushun, Li Jianyao, and dozens of other patriotic overseas Chinese who were illegally arrested in Rangoon; immediately release all patriotic overseas Chinese who were illegally arrested and unjustly sentenced in various parts of Burma; and immediately stop all anti-China and anti-Chinese activities. If the Burmese government ignores the repeated warnings of the Chinese government and obstinately persists in its policy of hostility towards China, the Burmese government must bear all the serious consequences that arise from this.

New China News Agency reported: Rangoon news: After the Burmese reactionary government unreasonably sentenced patriotic overseas Chinese Chen Bofu and ten others to imprisonment on February 20, it recently arrested and persecuted a large number of patriotic overseas Chinese in Rangoon and other places, further intensifying the creation of new anti-China and anti-Chinese atrocities.

On the morning of March 19, the Burmese reactionary government mobilized a large number of police and secret agents in various districts of Rangoon, under the pretext of "checking household registrations" and "verifying identity cards," using kidnapping and deception to unreasonably arrest leaders of various overseas Chinese organizations and patriotic overseas Chinese. According to preliminary information, dozens of overseas Chinese have been arrested.

The patriotic overseas Chinese in Burma, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, showed unyielding courage when they were unreasonably arrested. When the police and secret agents brutally broke into their homes, some sternly questioned them, making those people stare in amazement and unable to answer. On the way from the police station to the prison, the arrested overseas Chinese loudly protested the unreasonable arrests of the Burmese authorities in the prison car and shouted slogans in Chinese and Burmese such as "Long live the friendship between the peoples of China and Burma!" "Long live the great Mao Zedong Thought!" "Long live the great leader Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years! Ten thousand ten thousand years!" Many passersby standing on both sides of the road expressed great indignation at the atrocities of the Burmese reactionary government and great admiration for the unyielding spirit of these overseas Chinese. When they were locked up in the prison, the arrested overseas Chinese, despite the threats of the reactionary military police and secret agents, sang songs of Chairman Mao's quotations and shouted slogans of long live Chairman Mao.

The overseas Chinese who were arrested this time are innocent overseas Chinese engaged in overseas Chinese cultural and public welfare work. They have long resided in Burma, have always lived in harmony with the Burmese people, respected local laws and local people's customs and habits, served the cultural welfare of the broad masses of overseas Chinese, and also made a certain contribution to the economic and cultural development of Burma. The Burmese reactionary government's arbitrary arrest of them shows that it is further intensifying the persecution of patriotic overseas Chinese and deliberately creating new anti-China and anti-Chinese atrocities.

It is reported that on March 20 and 21, many overseas Chinese were also arrested in Mandalay, Mawlamyine, Pyay, Myitkyina, Bhamo, Lashio, and Taunggyi.

At present, the Burmese reactionary government is still continuing to arrest and persecute the broad masses of patriotic overseas Chinese in various parts of Burma using various despicable means. The Burmese reactionary government's new anti-China and anti-Chinese actions are a serious step to further deteriorate the relations between China and Burma. The Chinese people are seriously watching the development of the situation.

    缅甸政府迎合美帝苏修需要又一次大肆迫害爱国华侨
    我驻缅甸使馆向缅甸政府提出强烈抗议
    如缅甸政府不顾我国政府的警告，顽固坚持敌视中国政策，必须承担一切严重后果
    新华社五日讯　仰光消息：中国驻缅甸大使馆四日把一件抗议照会交给缅甸政府，就缅甸政府又一次大肆逮捕在缅甸的爱国华侨的事件，提出强烈抗议。
    照会说：一九六八年三月十九日凌晨，缅甸政府又大量出动警察和特务，采取突然袭击的方式，以“清查户口”和“核对身份证”等为借口，逮捕了大批居住在仰光和缅甸各地的爱国华侨。在被捕的爱国华侨中，仅在仰光一地的，就有爱国侨领陈福顺、李煁尧、华侨文化协会负责人陈兰生、杨双溪、华侨教师周雅宝和阮丹萍等几十人。现在对缅甸各地爱国华侨的逮捕还在继续进行，广大华侨的人身自由和安全受到了严重的威胁。
    照会指出：缅甸政府这样肆无忌惮地迫害爱国华侨，是对中国人民的猖狂挑衅，是进一步恶化中缅两国关系的严重步骤。对此，中华人民共和国大使馆向缅甸政府提出强烈抗议。
    照会说：缅甸政府不久以前，曾经无理驱逐新华社驻仰光工作人员，连续非法审讯和判处被捕的爱国华侨。现在，缅甸政府又进一步大肆逮捕无辜的华侨。与此同时，缅甸舆论还在政府唆使之下，加紧进行反华宣传，恶毒诽谤中国，煽动反华情绪。显然，缅甸政府是在有计划、有步骤地企图掀起又一次新的反华、排华浪潮，其目的同过去一样，仍然是为了迎合美帝、苏修的需要和加紧镇压国内人民。
    照会说：缅甸政府为了掩盖它无理迫害华侨的罪行，这次又使用了它惯于采用的手法，诬蔑被捕的爱国华侨“违犯了缅甸法律”，“参予了危害缅甸国家安全和人民福利的活动”。这种诬蔑是毫无根据的。在缅甸的爱国华侨一向遵循中国政府的教导，尊重缅甸的法律和缅甸人民的风俗习惯，同缅甸人民友好相处，努力促进中缅两国人民的友好关系，并且积极支持缅甸人民争取和维护民族独立的斗争。这是人所共知的事实，是缅甸政府的诬蔑所抹煞不了的。缅甸政府的诬蔑，只能更加暴露他们蛮横无理的反华排华的反动面目。
    照会最后说：中国大使馆严正要求缅甸政府，立即释放在仰光被非法逮捕的陈福顺、李煁尧等几十名爱国华侨；立即释放在缅甸各地被非法逮捕和无理判刑的所有爱国华侨；立即停止一切反华排华活动。如果缅甸政府不顾中国政府的一再警告，顽固坚持敌视中国的政策，缅甸政府必须承担由此而产生的一切严重后果。
    新华社讯　仰光消息：缅甸反动政府继二月二十日无理判处爱国华侨陈伯甫等十一人徒刑之后，最近又在仰光等地无理逮捕和迫害大批爱国华侨，变本加厉地制造新的反华排华暴行。
    三月十九日凌晨，缅甸反动政府出动大批警察、特务，在仰光各区，借口“清查户口”、“核对身份证”，用绑架和诓骗的卑鄙手段，无理逮捕各华侨团体负责人和爱国华侨。据初步了解，被捕的华侨已达数十人。
    用毛泽东思想武装起来的缅甸爱国华侨，在遭受无理逮捕时，表现了英勇不屈的大无畏精神。当警察、特务野蛮闯进他们的家门时，有的严厉责问，问得那些家伙瞠目结舌，无言答对。在从警察局押往监狱的途中，被捕华侨在囚车里一路大声抗议缅甸当局的无理逮捕，并用中缅两国语言高呼“中缅两国人民友好万岁！”“伟大的毛泽东思想万岁！”
  “伟大的领袖毛主席万岁！万岁！万万岁！”等口号。站在马路两旁的很多行人对缅甸反动政府的暴行表示无比愤慨，对这些华侨的英勇不屈的精神表示十分钦佩。在被关进牢房时，被捕华侨不顾反动军警、特务的威胁，高唱毛主席语录歌，高呼毛主席万岁等口号。
    这次横遭逮捕的华侨是从事华侨文教工作和华侨公益事业的无辜侨民，他们久居缅甸，一贯同缅甸人民友好相处，尊重当地法律和当地人民的风俗习惯，为广大华侨的文化福利事业服务，对缅甸经济和文化的发展也作出了一定的贡献。缅甸反动政府蛮横无理地逮捕他们，表明它正在进一步加紧迫害爱国华侨，蓄意制造新的反华排华暴行。
    据悉，三月二十日和二十一日，在曼德勒、毛淡棉、勃生、密支那、八莫、腊戍、东支等地，也有许多华侨被捕。
    目前缅甸反动政府还继续在缅甸各地大肆逮捕并以种种卑劣手段迫害广大爱国华侨。缅甸反动政府这种新的反华排华行径，是进一步恶化中缅两国关系的严重步骤。对此，中国人民正在严重地注视事态的发展。
