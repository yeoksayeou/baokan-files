    Ethiopian Students Oppose Promotion of American Lifestyle

    In the Ethiopian capital of Addis Ababa, a large-scale strike and demonstration recently erupted among students opposing the promotion of the American way of life and protesting against police suppression of students. Angry students destroyed the American Information Service office there.

    The strike and demonstration began on March 30. On that day, students at Haile Selassie University held a demonstration, angrily protesting against a mini-skirt fashion show held on campus that promoted the American way of life. The authorities immediately dispatched a large number of police to suppress the protest. Students bravely retaliated with stones. The police occupied and sealed off the university, arresting a group of students.

    The authorities' brutal actions provoked more student resistance. Middle and high school students in the capital took to the streets in successive days to demonstrate and support Haile Selassie University. Students also built barricades on the streets with wood and fought the police with stones.

    By April 9, university students were still on strike, demanding the release of seven student leaders who had been unjustly arrested. Middle school students, despite police suppression, continued to take to the streets to demonstrate in support of the university students fighting against persecution.

    U.S. Imperialism Intensifies Nuclear Tests Under the Guise of "Preventing Nuclear Proliferation"

    While the U.S. and Soviet revisionists were jointly concocting a "preventing nuclear proliferation" treaty, providing so-called "nuclear umbrellas" to reactionaries in various countries, and loudly proclaiming the need to stop nuclear threats, U.S. imperialism was actually intensifying underground nuclear tests and continuing to develop nuclear weapons.

    Following an underground nuclear test on March 25, the U.S. government's agency responsible for developing nuclear weapons, the Atomic Energy Commission, announced on April 10 that another underground nuclear test had been conducted in Nevada. This was the ninth underground nuclear test this year.

    All of this makes the revolutionary people of the world see more clearly: The "preventing nuclear proliferation" treaty of the U.S. and the Soviet Union is actually a cover for their policy of nuclear blackmail and nuclear threats.

    British Labour Government Raises Postal and Telephone Fees to Shift Crisis onto People

    To protect the interests of monopoly capital, the British Labour Government has shifted the deepening fiscal and economic crisis onto the broad masses of working people. In late March, it proposed a so-called "crisis budget," openly demanding that the British working people "tighten their belts" and make "sacrifices."

    No sooner had the words been spoken than the Labour Government began to cut into the British people. On April 10, the Labour Government announced an increase in postal and telephone charges. According to a Reuters report, this alone would allow the British ruling class to extort an additional 67 million pounds from the working people each year.

    埃塞俄比亚学生反对宣扬美国生活方式
    在埃塞俄比亚首都亚的斯亚贝巴，最近爆发了学生反对宣扬美国生活方式和抗议警察镇压学生的暴行的大规模罢课和示威，愤怒的学生捣毁了在那里的美国新闻处。
    这次大罢课和示威是三月三十日开始的。当天，海尔·塞拉西大学学生举行示威，愤怒抗议在校园里举行的宣扬美国生活方式的短裙时装展览。当局立即出动大批警察进行镇压。学生用石头英勇反击。警察进占并封锁了这所大学，逮捕了一批学生。
    当局的这一暴行激起了更多学生的反抗。首都的中小学生接连几天上街示威，并赶到海尔·塞拉西大学进行声援。学生还在大街上用木头筑起路障，用石头同警察搏斗。
    直至九日，大学生仍坚持罢课，并要求当局释放被无理逮捕的七名学生领袖。中学生也不顾警察的镇压，不断上街示威，声援反迫害的大学生。
  美帝在“防止核扩散”幌子下加紧核试验
    在美帝苏修合伙炮制“防止核扩散”条约草案，向各国反动派提供所谓“核保护伞”，大嚷什么制止核威胁时，美帝国主义却正在加紧进行地下核试验，继续发展核武器。
    继三月二十五日一次地下核试验后，美国政府专门发展核武器的机构、原子能委员会在十日宣布，又在内华达州进行一次地下核试验。这是今年以来的第九次地下核试验。
    这一切使世界革命人民更加看清：美苏的“防止核扩散”条约，实际上是美苏加紧进行核讹诈、核威胁政策的一个幌子。
  英工党政府提高邮电费向人民转嫁危机
    英国工党政府为了维护垄断资本利益，把日趋深重的财政经济危机转嫁于广大劳动人民身上，曾在三月下旬提出一项所谓“危机预算”，公然要英国劳动人民“勒紧腰带”，作出“艰苦牺牲”。
    话音未落，工党政府就向英国人民开刀了。四月十日，工党政府宣布提高邮政和电话费用。据路透社报道，仅这一项就使英国统治集团每年将从劳动人民身上剥削六千七百万英镑。
