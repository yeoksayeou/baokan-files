Chairman Mao's great declaration has pointed the way to victory for the liberation struggles of the world's people. The people of the entire world, united, are launching a sustained and fierce attack against U.S. imperialism and its running dogs.

The people of China, numbering in the hundreds of millions, are united in their joyous acclaim: Chairman Mao's great declaration will further inspire the two million American blacks and all the oppressed and exploited American people, who possess immense revolutionary strength, to make revolution in the heart of U.S. imperialism; it will further inspire all the oppressed peoples and nations of the world to wage a heroic struggle for complete liberation. The Chinese people are determined to carry forward the spirit of proletarian internationalism to the highest degree, to unite more closely with the revolutionary people of the world, and to defeat U.S. imperialism.

The New China News Agency reported on the 18th: The great declaration by the great teacher of the proletariat, Chairman Mao, in support of the struggle of American blacks against violence, has shaken the world. The revolutionary masses of our country are united in their joyous acclaim: Chairman Mao's great declaration is a new battle call to mobilize the people of the world to completely smash colonialism, imperialism, and all systems of exploitation. It will further inspire the two million American blacks and all the oppressed and exploited American people, who possess immense revolutionary strength, to make revolution in the heart of U.S. imperialism; it will further inspire all the oppressed peoples and nations of the world to wage a heroic struggle for complete liberation. The revolutionary masses in various parts of our country have responded most resolutely to the battle call of the great helmsman, Chairman Mao, and are determined to carry forward the spirit of proletarian internationalism to the highest degree, to unite more closely with the workers, peasants, revolutionary intellectuals, and all those who oppose U.S. imperialism in various countries, to form a mighty revolutionary army, and to launch a sustained and fierce attack against the common enemy of the people of the world, U.S. imperialism, and its running dogs.

"Chairman Mao supports me, I support; Chairman Mao waves his hand, I advance!" For the past two days, wherever the great declaration of the great helmsman, Chairman Mao, has been transmitted, it has aroused a strong response and set off a powerful wave of support for the struggle of American blacks against violence. From the capital of the great motherland, Beijing, to the border regions, from cities to the countryside, from factories, mines to offices and schools, everywhere there are tens of thousands of revolutionary people holding grand meetings and taking to the streets in massive demonstrations. In our largest city, Shanghai, today hundreds of thousands of revolutionary masses took to the streets in demonstrations, and 250,000 military and civilian personnel held a grand rally. In the cities of Tianjin, Wuhan, Guangzhou, Shenyang, Chongqing, Xi'an, and in the provincial capitals and autonomous region capitals, tens of thousands to hundreds of thousands of people held rallies and parades, firmly supporting Chairman Mao's great declaration. At the rallies and demonstrations in various places, the broad revolutionary masses were filled with emotion, repeatedly raising their fists and shouting: "All oppressed nations and peoples of the world, unite! Down with U.S. imperialism! Down with Soviet revisionism! Down with the reactionaries of all countries! Long live the invincible thought of Mao Zedong! Long live, long, long live the great leader Chairman Mao!"

The revolutionary torrent of support for American black brothers throughout the country shows that the revolutionary people of our country, nurtured by the great thought of Mao Zedong, have a very strong proletarian internationalist sentiment towards the oppressed American blacks and all oppressed peoples and nations of the world. The revolutionary masses in various places have expressed their determination to follow Chairman Mao's teaching that "the people who have already won revolution should aid the struggle of the people who are striving for liberation. This is our internationalist duty," to regard the struggle of American blacks against violence as our own struggle, and to fight side by side with American black brothers and all oppressed peoples and nations of the world to overthrow the common enemy of the people of the world, U.S. imperialism, and its running dogs, and to completely smash colonialism, imperialism, and all systems of exploitation. The broad working-class masses in various parts of our country, who have suffered deeply from the oppression and exploitation of imperialism, warmly acclaim Chairman Mao's declaration as expressing the sentiments of the working-class masses of the world. They say, the hearts of the proletariat and all oppressed peoples and nations of the world are connected. We must fully carry forward the spirit of proletarian internationalism and support with practical actions the struggle for liberation of American black brothers and all oppressed brothers in the world. Old worker Gao Chengyi of Qingdao Casting Machinery Factory said, Chairman Mao teaches us: "The proletariat not only wants to liberate itself but also wants to liberate all mankind." The oppressed and exploited American blacks and our working class have a flesh-and-blood connection. We must unite with the working class and laboring people of the world to confront the common enemy, U.S. imperialism, and strive for the complete liberation of all mankind. Met Aotao, a famous activist in studying Chairman Mao's works and a poor peasant from Taicang County, Jiangsu, said, Chairman Mao's great declaration speaks for the hearts of us poor and lower-middle peasants. The laboring people of our country have been liberated under the leadership of the great leader Chairman Mao, but American black brothers are still suffering oppression and exploitation. We poor and lower-middle peasants listen to Chairman Mao's words most. We must grasp revolution and promote production to support the struggle of American black brothers with practical actions.

Chairman Mao's great declaration has been transmitted to various places, and the broad revolutionary masses have warmly praised the struggle of American black brothers against violence, which has dealt a heavy blow to U.S. imperialism, which is in a state of internal and external difficulties. They say, as our great leader Chairman Mao has pointed out, the struggle of American blacks is a new call to arms for all oppressed and exploited American people in their struggle against the brutal rule of the monopoly capitalist class, and it is an integral part of the struggle of all peoples of the world against U.S. imperialism and of the contemporary world revolution. The broad poor and lower-middle peasants of Guangzhou's Guangyuanli People's Commune, who have a glorious tradition of anti-imperialist struggle, are indignant at the bloody suppression of American black brothers by U.S. imperialism. They say, where there is oppression, there is resistance. This is the truth of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought. American blacks have raised the banner of rebellion against U.S. imperialism and launched a magnificent struggle against violence, dealing a heavy blow to U.S. imperialism and strongly supporting the struggle of the Vietnamese people against U.S. aggression for national salvation and the revolutionary struggles of the peoples of the world. The revolutionary masses of Xi'an say, U.S. imperialism is on the decline, gasping for breath. As our great leader Chairman Mao has pointed out, the new storm of the struggle of American blacks against violence that has broken out in the United States is a prominent manifestation of the current political and economic crises of U.S. imperialism.

In his great declaration issued in 1963, "Support the Just Struggle of the American Blacks Against U.S. Imperialist Racial Discrimination," our great leader Chairman Mao pointed out: "National struggle, after all, is a class struggle issue." The revolutionary masses in various places, while joyously acclaiming the issuance of another great declaration by Chairman Mao in support of the struggle of American blacks, have unanimously pointed out that Chairman Mao's great declaration has once again most profoundly and scientifically revealed the class essence of the struggle of American blacks against violence, pointed out the only correct path for American blacks, oppressed American people, and all oppressed peoples and nations of the world to strive for complete liberation. The dock workers of Tianjin New Port stressed that all exploiting classes are breathing through the same nose, and all proletarians are bitter gourds on the same vine. American black brothers and all oppressed laboring people of the world will, following the path indicated by Chairman Mao, recognize their common class interests and common struggle goals, and launch a fierce attack against U.S. imperialism and its running dogs. The just struggle of American blacks will gain the sympathy and support of more and more laboring people and progressives of the white race in the United States and will combine with the workers' movement in the United States to form a mighty revolutionary army and completely smash the evil rule of the U.S. monopoly capitalist class. Chen Yonggui, deputy head of the Shanxi Revolutionary Committee and party branch secretary of Dazhai Brigade, said, we Chinese proletarian revolutionaries are fighting class struggle. We must unite with the proletariat of the world and all oppressed peoples and nations, hoist high the great red banner of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, and fight to the end to completely bury imperialism and colonialism, sweep away all harmful creatures, and build a red world without exploitation and oppression. At a rally of more than 30,000 military and civilian personnel in Nanning, the broad revolutionary masses expressed their determination to firmly remember Chairman Mao's great teaching of "never forgetting class struggle," to launch a sustained and fierce attack against domestic and foreign class enemies, to ensure that our country's proletarian iron mountain will never change color for thousands of years, and to make contributions to the complete liberation of all mankind.

Our great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "The experience of class struggle in the era of imperialism tells us: the working class and laboring masses can only defeat the armed bourgeoisie and landlords with the force of the gun; in this sense, we can say that the whole world can only be transformed with the gun." At the rallies held in various places, the broad revolutionary masses pointed out that the development of the struggle of American blacks against violence has proclaimed the bankruptcy of non-violence. The revolutionary workers of Beijing Foreign Languages Printing Plant said, only by using revolutionary violence against counter-revolutionary violence is the only correct path for oppressed peoples and nations to strive for complete liberation. Representatives of the army, navy, and air force stationed in Shanghai said at the rally, oppressed nations and peoples can only achieve complete liberation by taking up arms and fighting resolutely with the enemy, seizing power, and overthrowing the enemy's reactionary rule. This is the revolutionary principle of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought. The responsible comrades of the Guangdong Revolutionary Committee pointed out that all oppressed peoples who want liberation must use revolutionary armed forces to oppose counter-revolutionary armed forces. Without armed struggle, there is no position for the working class and laboring people. The revolutionary workers of Shaanxi's First Wool Textile Factory said, the assassination of black pastor Martin Luther King and the history of the struggle of American blacks against violence have once again fully proved Chairman Mao's wise judgment: "The oppressed peoples and nations cannot entrust their liberation to the 'wisdom' of imperialism and its running dogs, but can only achieve victory through strengthening unity and persisting in struggle." The old Red Army fighters of Jinggangshan said, "Political power grows out of the barrel of a gun," this is an unbreakable great truth.

The revolutionary masses throughout the country, while joyously acclaiming the issuance of Chairman Mao's great declaration, have unanimously expressed their determination to heighten their revolutionary vigilance a hundredfold, to thoroughly smash the sabotage activities of all class enemies at home and abroad, to resolutely respond to Chairman Mao's great call, to grasp revolution, promote production, work, and preparedness, to achieve a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, to build our great socialist motherland into a more powerful world revolutionary base, and to more powerfully support the struggle for liberation of American black brothers and all oppressed peoples and nations of the world.

The New China News Agency reported on the 18th: The broad cadres and fighters of the People's Liberation Army of China, who are infinitely loyal to the great leader Chairman Mao, today continued to hold grand rallies and parades, expressing their most enthusiastic support for Chairman Mao's declaration in support of the struggle of American blacks against violence, providing powerful ideological weapons for the revolutionary people of the world in their struggle, and expressing their most resolute support and powerful support for American black brothers in their struggle. The heroic soldiers of the three services, filled with deep proletarian internationalist sentiments, are full of fighting spirit and have expressed their determination to unite more closely with the people of the country and the workers, peasants, revolutionary intellectuals, and all those who oppose U.S. imperialism in various countries, to support the just struggle of American black brothers, and to launch a sustained and fierce attack against the sworn enemy of the revolutionary people of the world, U.S. imperialism, and its running dogs.

The People's Liberation Army of China is a heroic army created and led by the great helmsman Chairman Mao and directly commanded by Vice Helmsman Lin. Nurtured by the great thought of Mao Zedong, they have always regarded aiding the struggle of the people striving for liberation as their internationalist duty. After the issuance of Chairman Mao's great declaration, the entire army was in high spirits. The army, navy, and air force units universally held grand rallies of tens of thousands of people and held powerful demonstrations. The shouts and slogans of "Firmly support Chairman Mao's great declaration!" "Firmly support the just struggle of American black brothers!" "Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand times long live!" echoed through the camps, positions, airfields, and ships.

In the capital, the cadres and fighters of various organs and units of the People's Liberation Army stationed near Chairman Mao today continued to hold rallies and parades. Many leading comrades who have followed the great helmsman Chairman Mao for decades in the cause of liberation of the Chinese people, together with the broad masses of young fighters, read Chairman Mao's great declaration over and over again and studied Chairman Mao's great teaching: "The people who have already won revolution should aid the struggle of the people who are striving for liberation. This is our internationalist duty." Many old Red Army fighters in leading organs stressed at the meeting that Chairman Mao's declaration is a brilliant document of Marxism-Leninism, providing powerful ideological weapons for American black brothers and all revolutionary people of the world in their struggle; it is a lighthouse shining in all directions, pointing the way to victory for the liberation of American blacks and all oppressed peoples and nations of the world; it is a great battle call, bringing great encouragement to American blacks and all proletarians and revolutionary people of the world. We will resolutely respond to Chairman Mao's great call, forever be promoters of world revolution, resolutely support the just struggle of American blacks, resolutely unite with all the people of the world to struggle to completely bury colonialism, imperialism, and all systems of exploitation. The young fighters who joined the army during the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, facing the rising sun, gathered in front of the portrait of Chairman Mao and solemnly swore: "Chairman Mao, Chairman Mao! You old man support me, I support; you old man wave your hand, I advance! The warriors who are infinitely loyal to you will resolutely respond to your great call, strongly support the struggle of American blacks against violence, support the struggle of the Vietnamese people against U.S. aggression for national salvation, support the revolutionary struggles of the peoples of various countries, and never stop attacking the enemies of the proletariat!"

Chairman Mao's great declaration has been transmitted to Guangzhou, Fuzhou, Nanjing, Jinan, Shenyang, Kunming, Tibet, Xinjiang, Inner Mongolia, and other anti-imperialist and anti-revisionist frontiers, where the broad cadres and fighters who guard day and night have immediately set off a revolutionary wave of support for the struggle of American black brothers against violence. The cadres and fighters of the army, navy, and air force on various fronts have held rallies, discussions, and demonstrations on their own battle positions. On the front line of the South China Sea, which is only a water away from the battlefield of Vietnam, on the snow-capped highlands of the border outposts, and in the vast forests and snowy plains of the northern border of the motherland, many fighters have written down Chairman Mao's great declaration word by word under the lamp, and as soon as it is daylight, they beat drums and gongs, mobilize thousands of Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams, climb mountains and cross rivers, and spread Chairman Mao's great voice throughout the villages and fishing villages. The troops stationed on Nanri Island on the Fujian front also dispatched "sea propaganda ships" to brave the wind and rain and transmit Chairman Mao's great declaration to the people on the small islands far from the mainland. The propaganda ship docked on that island, and the island was in a state of excitement. The fishermen said, "We and American black brothers, although separated by vast oceans, the common struggle against U.S. imperialism makes our hearts connected. We must, under the wise leadership of the great teacher of the proletariat, Chairman Mao, actively support the revolutionary people of the world and defeat the common enemy, U.S. imperialism."

Many heroes and brave fighters who have fought against the Japanese invaders, the Kuomintang reactionaries, and the heavily armed U.S. imperialism on the battlefields of the War of Resistance Against Japan, the War of Liberation, and the War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea, while joyously acclaiming the issuance of Chairman Mao's great declaration, have also repeatedly studied Chairman Mao's great teaching of "political power grows out of the barrel of a gun." They say, the development of the struggle of American blacks against violence has proclaimed the bankruptcy of non-violence. The victorious struggles of the revolutionary people of the world have proved that Chairman Mao's great teaching of "the whole world can only be transformed with the gun" is an unbreakable truth. The fighters of the Red First Company and the "Iron Red Second Company" created by Chairman Mao on Jinggangshan reviewed the battle history of their company over the past few decades and deeply felt that the revolutionary road of Jinggangshan created by Chairman Mao is the only correct road for oppressed peoples and nations to achieve liberation. They said, in the era when the world has entered the new era of Mao Zedong Thought as the great banner, Chairman Mao has issued a declaration in support of the struggle of American blacks against violence, once again pointing the way to victory for the struggling American black brothers and all oppressed peoples and nations of the world. This is the greatest support and encouragement for American black brothers and all oppressed peoples and nations of the world in their struggle. We, the warriors of Chairman Mao, will forever remember Chairman Mao's great teaching, hold the gun tightly, and strive for the great ideal of liberating all mankind and realizing communism all our lives. The heroes and brave fighters of the former volunteer army who fought on the battlefield of the War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea and made the U.S. aggressors lose their souls, the heroes and meritorious soldiers who have struck down U.S. planes many times in the defense of our country's sacred airspace, such as Shu Jicheng, Gao Xiang, Dong Xiaohai, and Kang Zhensheng, and the fighters of the "Sea Pioneer Boat" and "Sea Tiger Boat" who have sunk U.S.-KMT pirate warships in the defense of our country's seas, while joyously acclaiming the issuance of Chairman Mao's great declaration, have repeatedly studied Chairman Mao's wise judgment of "imperialism and all reactionaries are paper tigers." They pointed out, combining their own personal battle experience, that battle practice tells us that imperialism and all reactionaries have no extraordinary power. As long as we hoist high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, unite more closely with the revolutionary people of the world, dare to struggle, are good at struggling, and persist in struggling, we will definitely be able to completely bury colonialism, imperialism, and all systems of exploitation! They expressed their proletarian internationalist fighting friendship to American black brothers: Fight on, American black brothers! The great teacher of the proletariat, Chairman Mao, supports you! The seven hundred million Chinese people armed with Mao Zedong Thought support you, and all revolutionary people of the world support you! Victory will definitely be yours!

The cadres and fighters of the Lanzhou, Wuhan, and Chengdu units and various units fighting on the front lines of the "Three Supports, Two Militarys" have expressed their great excitement in the days of joyously acclaiming Chairman Mao's great declaration, combining their personal experiences of the "Three Supports, Two Militarys" work, and said, China is the base of the world's revolutionary people, and the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is the fundamental guarantee for consolidating the world revolutionary base. We must, together with the people of the country, carry the current political revolution of the proletariat against the bourgeoisie and all exploiting classes to the end, and more powerfully support the struggle for liberation of all oppressed peoples and nations of the world.

    毛主席的伟大声明给世界人民解放斗争指明胜利航向
    全世界人民大团结向美帝及其帮凶发动持久猛烈进攻
    全国亿万军民同声欢呼：毛主席的伟大声明，必将进一步鼓舞蕴藏着极其强大的革命力量的美国黑人和整个被剥削、被压迫的美国人民，在美帝国主义的心脏大闹革命；必将进一步鼓舞全世界一切被压迫人民和被压迫民族，为争取彻底翻身而英勇战斗。中国人民决心高度发扬无产阶级国际主义精神，同世界革命人民更紧密地团结起来，打败美帝国主义
    新华社十八日讯　无产阶级的伟大导师毛主席支持美国黑人抗暴斗争的伟大声明，震撼了全世界。我国亿万革命群众同声欢呼：毛主席的伟大声明，是动员全世界人民彻底摧毁殖民主义、帝国主义和一切剥削制度的新的战斗号角。它必将进一步鼓舞蕴藏着极其强大的革命力量的两千万美国黑人和整个被剥削、被压迫的美国人民，在美帝国主义的心脏大闹革命；必将进一步鼓舞全世界一切被压迫人民和被压迫民族，为争取彻底翻身而英勇战斗。我国各地革命群众最坚决地响应伟大统帅毛主席的战斗号召，一定要高度地发扬无产阶级国际主义精神，同世界各国的工人、农民、革命知识分子和一切愿意反对美帝国主义的人们更紧密地团结起来，组成浩浩荡荡的革命大军，向着全世界人民的共同敌人美帝国主义及其帮凶们发动持久的猛烈的进攻。
    “毛主席支持我支持，毛主席挥手我前进！”两天来，伟大统帅毛主席的伟大声明传到哪里，哪里就激起了强烈的反响，掀起了强大的声援美国黑人抗暴斗争的革命浪潮。从伟大祖国的首都北京到边疆地区，从城市到农村，从工厂、矿区到机关、学校，到处都有成千上万的革命人民举行盛大集会，走上街头举行强大的示威游行。在我国最大的城市上海，今天有上百万革命群众上街示威，有二十五万军民举行了声势浩大的集会。在天津、武汉、广州、沈阳、重庆、西安等大城市，在各省省会和自治区的首府，都有几万人到几十万人举行集会游行，坚决拥护毛主席的伟大声明。在各地的集会和示威游行中，广大革命群众情绪激昂，不断地振臂高呼：“全世界被压迫民族和被压迫人民团结起来！”“打倒美帝！打倒苏修！打倒各国反动派！”“战无不胜的毛泽东思想万岁！”“伟大的领袖毛主席万岁！万万岁！”
    全国各地声援美国黑人兄弟的革命洪流表明，在伟大的毛泽东思想哺育下的我国革命人民，对被压迫的美国黑人以及世界上一切被压迫人民和被压迫民族，怀有极其强烈的无产阶级国际主义感情。各地革命群众表示，一定要遵照毛主席关于“已经获得革命胜利的人民，应该援助正在争取解放的人民的斗争，这是我们的国际主义的义务”的伟大教导，把美国黑人的抗暴斗争看作是我们自己的斗争，同美国黑人兄弟以及全世界一切被压迫人民、被压迫民族一起，为打倒全世界人民的共同敌人美帝国主义及其帮凶们，为彻底摧毁殖民主义、帝国主义和一切剥削制度而永远并肩战斗。曾经饱受帝国主义压迫和剥削的我国各地广大工农劳动群众，怀着深厚的无产阶级感情，热烈欢呼毛主席的声明说出了全世界工农劳动群众的心里话。他们说，全世界无产阶级和一切被压迫人民、被压迫民族心连心，我们一定要充分发扬无产阶级的国际主义精神，用实际行动支援美国黑人兄弟和世界上一切被压迫兄弟的解放斗争。青岛铸造机械厂的老工人高成义说，毛主席教导我们：“无产阶级不但要解放自己，而且要解放全人类。”被剥削、被压迫的美国黑人和我们工人阶级有着血肉的联系，我们要和全世界的工人阶级和劳动人民联合起来，对付万恶的共同敌人美帝国主义，争取全人类的彻底解放。著名的学习毛主席著作积极分子、江苏太仓县贫农社员顾阿桃说，毛主席的伟大声明，说出了我们贫下中农的心里话。我国劳动人民在伟大领袖毛主席的领导下得到了解放，美国黑人兄弟还在受压迫、受剥削。我们贫下中农最听毛主席的话，一定要狠抓革命，猛促生产，用实际行动支援美国黑人兄弟的斗争。
    毛主席的伟大声明传到各地，广大革命群众热烈赞扬美国黑人兄弟的抗暴斗争给了陷于内外交困的美帝国主义以沉重的打击。他们说，正如我们伟大领袖毛主席所指出的，美国黑人的斗争是整个被剥削、被压迫的美国人民反对垄断资产阶级残暴统治的新号角，是全世界人民反对美帝国主义的总斗争的一个组成部分，是当代世界革命的一个组成部分。具有光荣反帝斗争传统的广州三元里人民公社广大贫下中农，对美帝国主义血腥镇压美国黑人兄弟感到万分愤慨。他们说，哪里有压迫，哪里就有反抗，这是马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想的真理。美国黑人高举对美帝国主义造反有理的大旗，向美国反动派展开波澜壮阔的抗暴斗争，给了美帝国主义以沉重的打击，有力地支援了越南人民的抗美救国斗争和全世界人民的革命斗争。西安的革命群众说，美帝国主义已日薄西山，气息奄奄。正如伟大领袖毛主席指出的，美国黑人抗暴斗争的新风暴发生在美国国内，是美帝国主义当前整个政治危机和经济危机的一个突出表现。
    伟大领袖毛主席在一九六三年发表的《支持美国黑人反对美帝国主义种族歧视的正义斗争的声明》中就指出：“民族斗争，说到底，是一个阶级斗争问题。”各地革命群众在热烈欢呼毛主席支持美国黑人斗争的又一个伟大声明发表的时候，一致指出，毛主席的伟大声明，再一次最精辟、最科学地揭示了美国黑人抗暴斗争的阶级实质，指出了美国黑人、被压迫的美国人民以及全世界被压迫人民、被压迫民族争取彻底解放的唯一正确道路。天津新港的码头工人强调说，天下的剥削阶级都是一个鼻孔出气，天下的无产阶级都是一个藤上的苦瓜。美国黑人兄弟、全世界被压迫的劳动人民，必将按照毛主席所指引的道路，认清共同的阶级利益和共同的斗争目标，向着美帝国主义及其帮凶们展开猛烈的进攻。美国黑人的正义斗争，必将获得越来越多的美国白色人种中的劳动人民和进步人士的同情和支持，必将同美国工人运动相结合，组成浩浩荡荡的革命大军，彻底摧毁美国垄断资产阶级的罪恶统治。山西省革命委员会副主任、大寨大队党支部书记陈永贵说，我们中国的无产阶级革命派就是搞阶级斗争的。我们要和全世界无产阶级联合起来，和一切被压迫人民、被压迫民族联合起来，高举马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想伟大红旗，为彻底埋葬帝国主义、殖民主义，扫除一切害人虫，为建立一个没有剥削没有压迫的红彤彤的新世界，坚决战斗到底。在南宁市三万多军民举行的集会上，广大革命群众表示，一定要牢记毛主席“千万不要忘记阶级斗争”的伟大教导，向国内外阶级敌人发动持久的猛烈的进攻，保证我们国家的无产阶级铁打江山千秋万代永不变色，为全人类的彻底解放作出贡献。
    伟大领袖毛主席教导我们：“帝国主义时代的阶级斗争的经验告诉我们：工人阶级和劳动群众，只有用枪杆子的力量才能战胜武装的资产阶级和地主；在这个意义上，我们可以说，整个世界只有用枪杆子才可能改造。”在各地举行的集会上，广大革命群众指出，美国黑人抗暴斗争的发展，宣告了非暴力主义的破产。北京外文印刷厂的革命职工说，只有用革命的暴力反对反革命的暴力，才是被压迫人民、被压迫民族争取彻底解放的唯一正确道路。驻上海陆海空三军的代表在集会上说，被压迫民族和被压迫人民要取得彻底解放，只有拿起枪杆子，同敌人进行坚决的战斗，夺取政权，推翻敌人的反动统治，这是马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想的革命原则。广东省革命委员会的负责人指出，一切被压迫人民要求得解放，必须用革命的武装反对反革命的武装。离开了武装斗争，就没有工人阶级和劳动人民的地位。陕西省第一毛纺织厂的革命职工说，黑人牧师马丁·路德·金的被暗杀和美国黑人抗暴斗争的历史，又一次充分证明了毛主席的英明论断：“被压迫人民和被压迫民族，决不能把自己的解放寄托在帝国主义及其走狗的‘明智’上面，而只有通过加强团结、坚持斗争，才能取得胜利。”井冈山的老红军战士们说，“枪杆子里面出政权”，这是一条颠扑不破的伟大真理。
    全国各地革命群众在热烈欢呼毛主席伟大声明发表的时候，一致表示要百倍提高革命警惕，彻底粉碎国内外一切阶级敌人的阴谋破坏活动。一定要坚决响应毛主席的伟大号召，抓革命，促生产，促工作，促战备，夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利，把伟大的社会主义祖国建设成为更加强大的世界革命根据地，更有力地支援美国黑人兄弟和世界上一切被压迫人民、被压迫民族的解放斗争。

    毛主席的伟大声明传到广州、福州、南京、济南、沈阳、昆明、西藏、新疆、内蒙古等反帝、反修前哨，日日夜夜守卫在这里的广大指战员，立即掀起了声援美国黑人兄弟抗暴斗争的革命浪潮。陆海空军各条战线上的指战员，都在自己的战斗岗位上举行了集会、座谈和游行示威。在与战斗的越南一水之隔的南海前线，在风雪高原的边防哨所，在祖国北部边疆的林海雪原，许多战士在灯下一字一句记下毛主席的伟大声明，天一亮就敲锣打鼓，出动千百个毛泽东思想宣传队，爬山涉水，把毛主席的伟大声音传遍山寨和渔村。福建前线南日岛驻军还派出“海上宣传船”，顶风冒雨，把毛主席的伟大声明，传达给远离祖国大陆的沿海小岛上的群众。宣传船在那个海岛靠岸，那个岛上就一片欢腾。渔民群众激动地说：“我们和美国黑人兄弟，虽然远隔重洋，但反对美帝国主义的共同斗争使我们心连着心。我们一定要在无产阶级的伟大导师毛主席的英明领导下，积极支援全世界革命人民，打败共同的敌人美帝国主义。”
    许多在抗日战争、解放战争、抗美援朝的战场上，同日本侵略者、国民党反动派与武装到牙齿的美帝国主义反复较量过的战斗英雄和歼敌勇士们，在热烈欢呼毛主席伟大声明的同时，还反复学习了毛主席关于“枪杆子里面出政权”的伟大教导。他们说，美国黑人抗暴斗争的发展，宣告了非暴力主义的破产。世界革命人民正在进行的胜利斗争，证明了毛主席关于“整个世界只有用枪杆子才可能改造”的伟大教导是一个颠扑不破的真理。当年毛主席在井冈山亲手缔造的某部红一连和“钢铁红二连”的指战员们，回顾了他们连队几十年来的战斗历程，深深体会到毛主席创造的井冈山革命道路，是被压迫人民、被压迫民族获得解放的唯一正确的道路。他们说，在世界进入以毛泽东思想为伟大旗帜新时代的今天，毛主席发表了支持美国黑人抗暴斗争的声明，又一次为世界被压迫人民和被压迫民族指明了胜利的航向，这是对战斗中的美国黑人兄弟和全世界被压迫人民和被压迫民族的最大支持和最大鼓舞。我们毛主席的战士，一定永远牢记毛主席的伟大教导，握紧枪杆，为解放全人类和实现共产主义的伟大理想而奋斗终生。在抗美援朝战场上打得美国侵略军丧魂落魄的前志愿军战斗英雄鲁珉、陈伯悦、张洪斌、沈志宏和“上甘岭特功八连”、黄继光生前所在连、邱少云生前所在连的指战员，在保卫祖国神圣领空的战斗中多次击落美国飞机的战斗英雄和功臣舒积成、高翔、董小海、康振生等，在保卫祖国海疆的战斗中击沉美蒋海盗军舰的“海上先锋艇”、“海上猛虎艇”的指战员，在欢呼毛主席伟大声明发表的同时，反复学习毛主席关于“帝国主义和一切反动派都是纸老虎”的英明论断。他们结合自己亲身的战斗经历，满怀胜利信心地指出，战斗实践告诉我们，帝国主义和一切反动派并没有什么了不起的力量。只要我们高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，同全世界革命人民更紧密地团结起来，敢于斗争，善于斗争，坚持斗争，就一定能够把殖民主义、帝国主义和一切剥削制度彻底埋葬！他们满怀无产阶级国际主义的战斗友情，向美国黑人兄弟致意：战斗吧！美国黑人兄弟！无产阶级的伟大导师毛主席支持你们！用毛泽东思想武装起来的七亿中国人民支持你们，全世界一切革命人民支持你们！胜利一定属于你们！
    兰州、武汉、成都部队以及各部队战斗在“三支”
  “两军”第一线的广大指战员，在热烈欢呼毛主席伟大声明的日子里，结合“三支”“两军”工作的切身体会，无比激动地说，中国是世界革命人民的根据地，无产阶级文化大革命是巩固世界革命根据地的根本保证。我们一定要和全国人民一道，把当前这场无产阶级反对资产阶级和一切剥削阶级的政治大革命进行到底，更有力地支援全世界被压迫人民、被压迫民族的解放斗争。
