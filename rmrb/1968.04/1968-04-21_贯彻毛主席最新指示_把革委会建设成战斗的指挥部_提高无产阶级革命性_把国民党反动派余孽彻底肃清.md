The broad masses of revolutionary people in Anhui Province are filled with revolutionary enthusiasm and joy, enthusiastically celebrating the birth of the Anhui Provincial Revolutionary Committee and warmly hailing another great victory of Mao Zedong Thought!

On this joyous day, from the water towns of southern Anhui to the plains of northern Anhui, from the Dabie Mountains to the shores of Hongze Lake, various celebrations are being held throughout the province. People are carrying giant portraits of the great leader Chairman Mao, holding copies of the red "Quotations from Chairman Mao," singing "The East Is Red," and repeatedly raising their fists to shout, "Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years, ten thousand times ten thousand years!" The broad revolutionary masses have expressed their determination to hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, to take Comrade Lin Biao as a shining example, to be loyal to the great teacher of the proletariat, Chairman Mao, and to grasp the use of the invincible Mao Zedong Thought. They will carry out the mass movement of studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought more extensively and deeply, turning Anhui Province into a red school of Mao Zedong Thought.

At this moment of celebrating the birth of the Anhui Provincial Revolutionary Committee, the broad masses of revolutionary cadres and revolutionary people have reviewed Chairman Mao's latest instructions on revolutionary committees. They said, Chairman Mao's great instructions have pointed out the fundamental direction for the construction of revolutionary committees at all levels. We must resolutely implement them. We must build the revolutionary committees into command centers that emphasize proletarian politics, have proletarian revolutionary authority, and can lead the revolutionary masses to fight against the enemies of the proletariat.

The great leader Chairman Mao has recently pointed out profoundly: "The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is, in essence, a great political revolution carried out by the proletariat against the bourgeoisie and all exploiting classes under the condition of socialism, a continuation of the long-term struggle between the Communist Party of China and the broad revolutionary masses led by it and the reactionary Kuomintang, and a continuation of the class struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie." Revolutionary cadres and revolutionary people in various parts of Anhui say, the handful of diehard capitalist roaders within the Party, as well as traitors and spies, are remnants of the already defeated reactionary Kuomintang. They will never accept their own destruction and will always struggle desperately. They are always looking for opportunities to make a comeback and to reverse the verdict. We must further strengthen our class struggle consciousness, further arm ourselves with Mao Zedong Thought, enhance our proletarian revolutionary nature, and launch continuous attacks on the handful of capitalist roaders within the Party, such as Liu Shaoqi and his agents in Anhui, Li Baohua and Huang Yan, to thoroughly eliminate all the poison of counter-revolutionary revisionism they have spread. At present, we must be particularly vigilant and resolutely oppose right opportunism, right capitulationism, and right conservatism, and resolutely repel the counter-revolutionary wind of reversing correct verdicts. We must dig out all the hidden traitors, spies, and all counter-revolutionary elements, further consolidate our proletarian dictatorship, and defend our socialist red homeland.

The broad masses of revolutionary cadres and revolutionary people in the province are full of vigor and high morale, determined to celebrate the glorious birth of the provincial revolutionary committee with actual actions of seizing revolution and promoting production. Steel workers in Ma'anshan and coal miners in Huainan and Suixi have created new production achievements in recent days and reported them to the provincial revolutionary committee. The communist warrior Cai Yongxiang's hometown, Lakebin People's Commune in Feidong County, expressed their determination to take Comrade Cai Yongxiang as an example and resolutely defend the newly born provincial revolutionary committee. They seized the revolution and promoted production on this joyous day, making the spring plowing and production lively and bustling. Inspired by the joyous news of the birth of the provincial revolutionary committee, various units in different places have recently achieved revolutionary great alliances and revolutionary three-in-ones. The revolutionary people of the entire province are determined to carry forward the thorough revolutionary spirit of the proletariat and achieve a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution!

The People's Liberation Army stationed in Anhui and the broad cadres and soldiers of the Anhui Provincial Military Region are filled with joy and enthusiasm, warmly hailing the birth of the Anhui Provincial and Hefei Municipal Revolutionary Committees in the storm of class struggle. They are determined to hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, grasp class struggle, strengthen military-civilian unity, and make new contributions to achieving a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

The joyous news of the birth of the Anhui Provincial and Hefei Municipal Revolutionary Committees spread across the Jianghuai region. The People's Liberation Army stationed in Anhui, including the army, navy, and air force, from headquarters to platoons, from high mountain outposts to the front lines of "three supports and two militaries," are all decorated with red flags. The broad cadres and soldiers enthusiastically shout, "Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years, ten thousand times ten thousand years!" They held rallies and parades with the broad revolutionary masses to warmly celebrate the glorious birth of the Anhui Provincial Revolutionary Committee.

"The masses are the real heroes." On this grand day of celebrating the birth of the Anhui Provincial and Hefei Municipal Revolutionary Committees, the broad cadres and soldiers reviewed Chairman Mao's great teachings, recalled the battle course of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and highly praised the great achievements created by the revolutionary cadres and revolutionary masses of Anhui Province. Former first-level hero of the Chinese People's Volunteers and battalion commander of a certain unit, Hu Xiudao, said: We firmly support the revolutionary cadres, learn from them, and help them further consolidate and develop the revolutionary great alliance and revolutionary three-in-one on the principle of Mao Zedong Thought, and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end.

On this day of celebrating the birth of the Anhui Provincial and Hefei Municipal Revolutionary Committees, the cadres and soldiers seriously studied and deeply understood the wise teachings of the great leader Chairman Mao: "The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is, in essence, a great political revolution carried out by the proletariat against the bourgeoisie and all exploiting classes under the condition of socialism, a continuation of the long-term struggle between the Communist Party of China and the broad revolutionary masses led by it and the reactionary Kuomintang, and a continuation of the class struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie." They enhanced their class struggle consciousness and heightened their awareness of line struggle. The cadres and soldiers unanimously expressed their determination to be a hundred times more vigilant, never forget class struggle, and actively and continuously launch attacks on class enemies. The cadres and soldiers of the Eighth Platoon of a certain unit in the Hefei garrison, who were awarded collective first-class merit in the Battle of Triangle Hill, and the cadres and soldiers of the Eleventh Platoon of a certain unit in the Ma'anshan garrison said in a discussion: We must use Mao Zedong Thought, this most sharp weapon of thought, to expose all the tricks of the class enemies, carry forward the spirit of thorough revolution, deeply carry out the great criticism, thoroughly criticize and expose Liu Shaoqi and his agents in Anhui, Li Baohua and Huang Yan, and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end.

    新华社合肥二十日电　安徽省广大革命人民满怀革命豪情和胜利喜悦，热烈庆祝安徽省革命委员会的诞生，热烈欢呼毛泽东思想的又一伟大胜利！
    在这大喜的日子里，从皖南水乡到淮北平原，从大别山区到洪泽湖边，全省各地都隆重地举行了各种庆祝活动。人们抬着伟大领袖毛主席的巨幅画像，手捧红彤彤的《毛主席语录》，高唱《东方红》，一遍又一遍地振臂高呼：“毛主席万岁！万万岁！”广大革命群众表示，一定要更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，以林副主席为光辉榜样，对无产阶级的伟大导师毛主席胸怀一个“忠”字，对战无不胜的毛泽东思想狠抓一个“用”字，更加广泛深入地开展活学活用毛泽东思想的群众运动，把安徽省办成红彤彤的毛泽东思想大学校。
    广大无产阶级革命派和革命群众，在欢呼安徽省革命委员会胜利诞生的时刻，重温了毛主席关于革命委员会的最新指示。他们说，毛主席的伟大指示，为各级革命委员会的建设指出了根本方向。我们一定要坚决贯彻执行。要把革命委员会建设成为突出无产阶级政治、有无产阶级革命权威、能够率领革命群众对无产阶级的敌人进行战斗的革命司令部。
    伟大领袖毛主席最近极其深刻地指出：“无产阶级文化大革命，实质上是在社会主义条件下，无产阶级反对资产阶级和一切剥削阶级的政治大革命，是中国共产党及其领导下的广大革命人民群众和国民党反动派长期斗争的继续，是无产阶级和资产阶级阶级斗争的继续。”安徽各地广大无产阶级革命派说，隐藏在安徽的党内一小撮顽固不化的走资派，以及叛徒、特务，就是一些早已覆灭的国民党反动派的余孽。他们绝不会甘心自己的灭亡，总是要进行垂死的挣扎。他们时时刻刻在窥测方向，妄图翻案和反攻倒算。我们必须进一步加强阶级斗争观念，进一步用毛泽东思想武装自己的头脑，提高自己的无产阶级革命性，向中国赫鲁晓夫等党内最大的一小撮走资派及其在安徽的代理人李葆华、黄岩之流，不停顿地展开进攻，彻底肃清他们散布的一切反革命修正主义流毒。当前，要特别警惕和坚决反对右倾分裂主义，右倾投降主义，右倾保守主义，坚决击退反革命翻案妖风，一定要把隐藏的叛徒、特务以及一切反革命分子统统挖出来，进一步巩固我们的无产阶级专政，保卫我们社会主义的红色江山。
    全省广大无产阶级革命派和革命群众意气风发，斗志昂扬，决心以抓革命、促生产的实际行动来庆祝省革命委员会的光荣诞生。马鞍山的钢铁工人以及淮南、濉溪煤矿的工人们，这几天都创造了新的生产成绩，向省革命委员会报喜。共产主义战士蔡永祥家乡肥东县湖滨人民公社的贫下中农表示，要以蔡永祥同志为榜样，坚决保卫新生的省革命委员会。他们在大喜的日子里抓革命、促生产，使春耕生产出现热气腾腾的景象。在省革命委员会诞生的喜讯鼓舞下，各地最近几天又有一些单位实现了革命大联合和革命三结合。全省革命人民决心发扬无产阶级的彻底革命精神，夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利！
    新华社合肥二十日电　人民解放军安徽驻军和安徽省军区广大指战员，满怀胜利的喜悦心情，热烈欢呼安徽省和合肥市革命委员会在阶级斗争的暴风雨中胜利诞生，他们决心更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，狠抓阶级斗争，加强军民团结，为夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利立新功。
    安徽省和合肥市革命委员会胜利诞生的喜讯传到江淮大地以后，人民解放军驻安徽陆、海、空三军，从机关到连队，从高山哨所到“三支”“两军”第一线，到处红旗招展，广大指战员热烈欢呼：“毛主席万岁！万万岁！”他们和广大革命群众一道集会游行，热烈欢庆安徽省革命委员会的光荣诞生。
      “群众是真正的英雄”。在欢庆安徽省和合肥市革命委员会胜利诞生的盛大节日里，广大指战员重温毛主席这一伟大教导，回顾无产阶级文化大革命的战斗历程，高度赞扬安徽省无产阶级革命派和广大革命群众所创建的巨大功绩。前中国人民志愿军一级战斗英雄、某部营长胡修道说：我们坚决支持无产阶级革命派，向他们学习，并帮助他们在毛泽东思想原则基础上进一步巩固和发展革命的大联合和革命的三结合，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。
    在欢庆安徽省和合肥市革命委员会胜利诞生的节日里，指战员们还认真学习和深刻领会伟大领袖毛主席的英明教导：“无产阶级文化大革命，实质上是在社会主义条件下，无产阶级反对资产阶级和一切剥削阶级的政治大革命，是中国共产党及其领导下的广大革命人民群众和国民党反动派长期斗争的继续，是无产阶级和资产阶级阶级斗争的继续。”增强了阶级斗争观念，提高了路线斗争的觉悟。指战员们一致表示要百倍提高革命警惕性，念念不忘阶级斗争，主动地和不停顿地向阶级敌人发动进攻。曾在上甘岭战役中荣获集体一等功的合肥驻军某部八连指战员和马鞍山驻军某部十一连指战员在座谈中说：我们一定要用毛泽东思想这个最锐利的思想武器，去识破阶级敌人的一切阴谋，发扬“宜将剩勇追穷寇”的彻底革命精神，深入地开展革命的大批判，把中国赫鲁晓夫等党内最大的一小撮走资派及其在安徽的代理人李葆华、黄岩之流批深批透，斗倒斗臭，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。
