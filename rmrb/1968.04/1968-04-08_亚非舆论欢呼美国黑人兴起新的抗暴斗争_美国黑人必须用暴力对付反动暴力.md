Newspapers in Syria, Tanzania, and Algeria have hailed the anti-violence struggle of American blacks. They pointed out that American blacks must use violence to counter the violence of the U.S. reactionary authorities.

The Syrian newspaper *Al-Thawra* published a commentary on April 6th, praising the anti-violence struggle of American blacks. The commentary said that the struggle of American blacks will achieve real victory in the United States. It said that based on the current situation, it can be determined that the anti-violence struggle of American blacks will gain more support from blacks in the future, which will enable them to deal a greater blow to the U.S. system, and will also enable them to form a powerful front with American progressives and the broad masses of workers. This will expand the struggle against monopoly capital and against the heads of the Pentagon who protect the insatiable interests of American imperialism.

This newspaper pointed out in a commentary on March 31st: The anti-violence struggle of American blacks is not only the result of the racist policies adopted by the U.S. authorities, but also the result of the U.S. system itself, which oppresses all exploited classes, including blacks.

The commentary said: "The violent actions of blacks have deepened the contradictions within American society and intensified sharp struggles. When all oppressed forces unite and organize, the struggle will reach its climax."

The Tanzanian newspaper *The Nationalist* published an editorial on April 6th, stating that Martin Luther King's advocacy of "non-violent struggle" has increasingly come under suspicion. The younger generation of American blacks are convinced that "violence must be answered with violence against the violence that oppresses American blacks."

The editorial concluded: "White violence has destroyed Martin Luther King's formula of non-violence. This can only prove the correctness of the argument that non-violent protest is meaningless in a lawless society."

The Algerian newspaper *Al-Mujahid* commented that the black masses in the United States are more convinced than ever that they can only resist racist violence with violence.

    亚非舆论欢呼美国黑人兴起新的抗暴斗争
    美国黑人必须用暴力对付反动暴力
    新华社七日讯　叙利亚、坦桑尼亚和阿尔及利亚报纸欢呼美国黑人的抗暴斗争。它们指出，美国黑人必须用暴力来对付美国反动当局的暴力。
    叙利亚《革命报》六日发表评论，欢呼美国黑人的抗暴斗争。评论说，美国黑人的斗争将在美国取得真正的胜利。评论说，根据目前的事态，可以断定，美国黑人的抗暴斗争，今后将得到更多的黑人的支持，这将使得他们对美国制度给予更大的打击，而且使得他们和美国的进步分子与广大工人组成强大的阵线，并将扩大反对垄断资本和反对那些保护美国贪得无厌的帝国主义利益的五角大楼的头子们的斗争。
    这家报纸在三月三十一日的一篇评论中指出：美国黑人的抗暴斗争不仅是美国当局所采取的种族主义政策的结果，也是美国制度本身的结果，这个制度压迫所有被剥削阶级，也压迫黑人。
    评论说：“黑人的抗暴行动加深了美国社会内部的矛盾，加剧了尖锐的斗争。当所有被压迫的力量团结起来和组织起来以后，剧烈的斗争将到达高潮。”
    坦桑尼亚《民族主义者》六日发表的社论说，马丁·路德·金所提倡的“非暴力斗争最近越来越受到怀疑”。年青一代的美国黑人确信，“对于压迫美国黑人的暴力必须用暴力来回答”。
    社论最后说：“白人的暴力已经毁灭了马丁·路德·金的非暴力的公式。这只能证明这样一种论点是正确的，即在一个无法无天的社会中非暴力的抗议是没有意义的。”
    阿尔及利亚《圣战者日报》在评论中说，美国黑人群众今天比以往任何时候更加确信，他们只能用暴力来抗击种族主义的暴力。
