	Chinese Foreign Ministry's First Asia Department official summoned the Indian Chargé d'Affaires to the Chinese Embassy, Sathe, on April 8 to protest the unreasonable arrest of two Indian staff members of the Chinese Embassy in India on April 3, which was a serious provocation against the Chinese Embassy. The official strongly condemned the Indian government's actions.

	On the morning of April 3, at 8 AM, Amar, an Indian driver employed by the Chinese Embassy in India, was unreasonably arrested by Indian police while driving an embassy car on official business. On the same morning, Bahadur, an Indian gatekeeper employed by the embassy, was also arrested by Indian authorities while on his way to the hospital for medical treatment.

	As early as the first half of March this year, the Indian government had threatened to persecute embassy staff members and made so-called "accusations" while inciting anti-China sentiment over the illegal intrusion of Indian police into the Chinese Embassy. Now, the Indian government has indeed taken such despicable actions. This shows that the Indian government is deliberately persecuting Indian staff members of the Chinese Embassy, attempting to disrupt the normal functioning of the embassy. This is a planned and premeditated act of revenge by the Indian government, and another serious provocation against the Chinese Embassy in India following the illegal intrusion of Indian police into the Chinese Embassy.

	The Chinese Foreign Ministry's First Asia Department official demanded that Sathe immediately report the strong protest of the Chinese government to the Indian government. The official demanded that the Indian side immediately stop persecuting Chinese Embassy staff and ensure the normal functioning of the embassy. The official also pointed out that the Chinese government reserves the right to make further representations.

	On April 3, Chen Zhaoyuan, the Chargé d'Affaires of the Chinese Embassy in India, also strongly protested to the Indian Foreign Ministry over this matter.

    我外交部第一亚洲司负责人召见印度驻华使馆临时代办
    强烈抗议印政府无理逮捕我驻印使馆印籍雇员
    新华社八日讯　中华人民共和国外交部第一亚洲司负责人八日召见印度驻华大使馆临时代办沙梯，就四月三日印度政府无理逮捕中国驻印度大使馆两名印籍雇员，对中国大使馆进行严重挑衅一事，向印度政府提出强烈抗议。
    四月三日上午八时，中国驻印度大使馆雇用的印籍司机阿玛在驾驶大使馆的汽车执行公务时，被印度警察无理逮捕。同日上午，大使馆雇用的印籍看门人巴哈杜尔在去医院看病时，也被印方逮捕。
    早在今年三月上旬，印度政府就印度警察非法闯入中国大使馆一事煽动反华时，即扬言要对大使馆的印籍雇员进行迫害，提出所谓“控诉”。现在印度政府果然采取了这种卑劣的行动。这表明，印度政府是蓄意要对中国大使馆印籍雇员进行政治迫害，企图以此破坏中国大使馆正常进行工作的条件。这是印度政府一种有计划、有预谋的报复行动，是印度政府继印度警察非法闯入中国大使馆以后一手策划的又一次对中国驻印度大使馆的严重挑衅事件。
    中国外交部第一亚洲司负责人要求印度临时代办沙梯将中国政府的强烈抗议立即报告印度政府，要求印度方面立即停止对中国大使馆雇员的迫害，保证大使馆正常进行工作的条件，并且指出，中国政府保留进一步提出交涉的权利。
    四月三日，中国驻印度大使馆临时代办陈肇源也就此事向印度外交部提出了强烈抗议。
