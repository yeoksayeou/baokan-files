The Soviet revisionist clique has controlled the "Communist Youth League," which has degenerated into a club for the privileged class's young masters and mistresses. They regard feasting, drinking, and entertainment as their main activities.

Recently, the *Leningrad Pravda* reported that there is a "Communist Youth League—Youth Beauty Salon" on the Third Street in the suburbs of Leningrad. There, many girls with "Communist Youth League member" signs often gather to discuss new hairstyles. One Sunday, the beauty salon was unusually lively. The Communist Youth League members in the barbershop decided to hold a performance-style hair competition. Young tailors also participated in this performance. They wore the clothes they made, and the barbers designed suitable hairstyles for each participant.

The Soviet revisionist clique is doing everything possible to corrupt Soviet youth with bourgeois lifestyles.

		Revival of Old Wedding Ceremonies

In Moscow, one can often see old Russian-style three-horse carriages running on the streets. They do not carry ordinary passengers but newlyweds. TASS has reported on this, saying: "Ancient wedding traditions are being revived in Moscow. Now, the groom and bride can book a Russian-style three-horse carriage by phone to go to the wedding venue," and the traffic police on the streets "unobstructedly give them the green light."

Obviously, this revival of old wedding ceremonies is advocated by the Soviet revisionist clique. Now, renting these Russian-style carriages has become a thriving business. TASS reported that "all wedding carriages for the entire spring season have been booked."

		Diverse Advertisements

Last month, *Moscow Evening News* began publishing a special advertising supplement. In addition to general commodity advertisements, this supplement also includes a full page of recruitment advertisements and various advertisements related to buying and selling stamps, family celebrations, lost items, job seeking, divorce announcements, and so on.

This fact not only shows that the newspapers of the Soviet revisionist clique have become bourgeois newspapers but also reflects that today's Soviet society has completely become capitalist.

		Films Poisoning Children

The Soviet revisionist clique is using films to instill bourgeois ideas in Soviet children and poison the minds of young people. Recently, the Moscow Film Studio actually produced a film titled *I Love You*, which is about the love story of teenage boys and girls. The director, Fleyz, shamelessly boasted that the purpose of making this pornographic film is to "reflect complex life phenomena" and "help" children "understand life" and "enrich their spiritual world"!

It is said that *I Love You* is the director's eighth film. His other "works" include *I Bought Dad* and *Travelers with Luggage*, among others. Just by looking at the film titles, one can know what kind of stuff these films and their creators are.

### 苏修叛徒集团复辟资本主义的形形色色

    苏修叛徒集团复辟资本主义的形形色色
    如此“共青团”活动
    苏修叛徒集团控制下的“共青团”，已经堕落成为特权阶层少爷小姐的俱乐部，并且把吃喝玩乐当作自己的主要活动内容。
    《列宁格勒真理报》不久以前报道说，列宁格勒第三市郊大街上有一个“共青团——青年美容室”。在那里，许多挂着“共青团员”招牌的“姑娘们常常在一起讨论新的发型”。有一个星期天，“美容室内异常活跃。理发室的共青团员们决定进行一次表演性的发型比赛。年轻的裁缝师傅也参加了这次表演。她们穿上了自己做的服装，而理发师则在每一个确定的对象身上设计了合适的发型”。
    苏修集团就是这样千方百计地用资产阶级生活方式腐蚀苏联青年。
        复旧的婚礼
    在莫斯科，现在人们常常可以看到一种旧俄时代的三套式马车在奔行。它所运载的并不是普通的乘客，而是新婚的夫妇。塔斯社对此作了一番渲染。它在一则报道中说：“古老的婚礼传统正在莫斯科恢复。现在，新郎和新娘可以用电话订俄式三套马车，乘它到举行婚礼的地方去”，而街上的“民警”则“无阻碍地给他们开放绿灯”。
    显然，这种复旧的婚礼是苏修叛徒集团所提倡的。现在出租这种俄式马车，已经成为一项生意兴隆的行业。塔斯社在报道中说，“整个春季的婚礼用车已经预订一空了”。
        五花八门的广告
    《莫斯科晚报》上个月开始出版专门的广告副刊。这种副刊除了刊登一般的商品广告以外，还有一整版招聘人员的广告，以及有关买卖邮票、家庭喜庆、遗失物件、寻求职业、离婚声明等等五花八门的广告。
    这个事实，不仅说明苏修叛徒集团的报纸已经变为资产阶级的报纸，而且反映了今天的苏联社会已经完全资本主义化了。
        毒害儿童的影片
    苏修叛徒集团正在利用电影来对苏联儿童灌输资产阶级思想，毒害青少年的心灵。莫斯科的电影制片厂不久前竟然拍摄了一部以少年男女学生恋爱故事为主题的影片，片名就叫《我爱你》。
    影片的导演弗莱兹居然还无耻地吹嘘说，他拍摄这部黄色影片的目的是要“表现复杂的生活现象”，“帮助”儿童“了解生活”，“丰富他们的精神世界”！
    据说，《我爱你》是这个导演的第八部影片，他的其它“作品”有《我买了爸爸》和《带行李的旅行者》等。只要看看影片的名字，就可以知道这些影片及其作者究竟是些什么货色了。
