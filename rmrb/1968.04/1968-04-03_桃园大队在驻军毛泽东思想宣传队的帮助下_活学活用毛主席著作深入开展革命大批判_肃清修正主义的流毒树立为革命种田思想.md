The Taoyuan Production Brigade, with the assistance of the stationed military Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team, deeply carries out revolutionary criticism and struggles to eliminate the poison of revisionism and establish the spirit of farming for revolution.

According to Xinhua News Agency, Shijiazhuang, April 1—The poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres of the Taoyuan Production Brigade in Luwangzhuang People's Commune, Lufeng County, Hebei Province, with the assistance of the stationed military Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team, use Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon to continue deeply carrying out mass revolutionary criticism during the spring plowing season. They thoroughly eliminate the poison of anti-revolutionary economism spread by Liu Shaoqi and his wife Wang ×× in this brigade, and establish the revolutionary spirit of self-reliance and hard struggle of the people of Dazhai, thus powerfully promoting spring plowing production.

The Taoyuan Production Brigade is the brigade where Liu Shaoqi concocted the notorious "Taoyuan Experience." After the unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution began, the poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres of this brigade, armed with the extremely sharp weapon of Mao Zedong Thought, verbally and in writing, launched a great denunciation, exposure, criticism, and struggle against Liu Shaoqi and his wife Wang ××. Over the past year, the poor and lower-middle peasants of the Taoyuan Production Brigade held more than 1,300 criticism meetings, opened seven "Revolutionary Criticism Special Columns" on the streets, and wrote more than 10,000 big-character posters, severely exposing and criticizing the heinous crimes committed by Liu Shaoqi and his wife Wang ×× in this brigade.

During the current busy spring plowing season, the comrades of the stationed military Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team helped the poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres of the Taoyuan Production Brigade to seriously study Chairman Mao's great teachings of "Political work is the lifeline of all economic work" and "Carry the revolution through to the end." They further deeply carried out revolutionary criticism. The revolutionary criticism battlefield—Mao Zedong Thought study classes—increased from the original nine to more than sixty; from being held only in the brigade and production teams, they developed to being held in every courtyard and household. The community members and revolutionary cadres concentrated their firepower, combined with the problems in spring plowing production, and specifically criticized the anti-revolutionary economism fallacies of "material incentives," "work points as the commander," and "profits as the commander" spread by Liu Shaoqi and his wife in Taoyuan. They said, Liu Shaoqi dispatched his wife Wang ×× to invest a large amount of state funds in the Taoyuan Production Brigade, promoting material incentives, work points as the commander, and profits as the commander. As a result, this brigade's grain production decreased year by year during and after the Four Clean-ups, and the state procurement tasks were not completed. In 1967, because of the emphasis on proletarian politics, the active study and application of Mao Zedong Thought, the carrying out of revolutionary criticism, and the learning of the revolutionary spirit of the people of Dazhai, hard struggle, and unprecedented agricultural bumper harvest, the state procurement tasks were exceeded.

Through revolutionary criticism, the poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres of the brigade further recognized the harmfulness of anti-revolutionary economism, saw more clearly Liu Shaoqi's wolfish ambitions of opposing socialism and attempting to restore capitalism, and thus hated Liu Shaoqi and his wife even more, and loved Great Leader Chairman Mao even more. The poor and lower-middle peasants said, Liu Shaoqi's material incentives are morphine needles, sugar-coated bullets, injecting us with the bourgeois "self." We must thoroughly smash anti-revolutionary economism, establish the revolutionary spirit of self-reliance and hard struggle, and the proletarian "public" spirit of farming for revolution, and resolutely walk the socialist bright path indicated by Great Leader Chairman Mao.

Revolutionary criticism promoted spring plowing production. The broad poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres resolutely responded to Chairman Mao's great call of "Agriculture Learn from Dazhai," took Dazhai as an example, broke private interests and established public interests, and farmed for revolution. The community members all went to work, and spring plowing production was carried out enthusiastically. More than forty housewives who had never participated in collective production before also went to the front line of spring plowing production. They said: We go to work not for a few work points, but to implement Chairman Mao's great strategic plan of "Prepare for war, prepare for famine, and serve the people," to produce more grain, support the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, support the socialist construction of the motherland, and support the world revolution. This year, the higher authorities allocated the task of repairing and benefiting 270 work units of irrigation channels to the Taoyuan Production Brigade. They went to work singing Mao Zedong Quotations Songs, and under the inspiration of Chairman Mao's teaching of "Make up your mind, do not be afraid of sacrifice, overcome all difficulties, and strive for victory," they got up at dawn and slept at midnight. They completed the task in only 200 work units. In the past, this area used high-quality coal to burn the seedling beds for sweet potatoes in the spring. The Taoyuan Production Brigade asked the state for more than 30 tons of coal every year. This year, the community members discussed this problem in the Mao Zedong Thought study classes and studied Chairman Mao's teaching of "Further economize and make revolution." They said, standing in Taoyuan, we should think of the whole country, and economize as much as possible. They used substitutes and did not ask the state for coal, but still completed the task of cultivating sweet potato seedlings according to the planting plan. Currently, the spring plowing production situation in this brigade is excellent. Spring fertilizer has all been delivered to the fields, paddy fields and channels have all been leveled and repaired, winter wheat has been weeded once, and spring plowing fields have been plowed.

    桃园大队在驻军毛泽东思想宣传队的帮助下
    活学活用毛主席著作深入开展革命大批判  肃清修正主义的流毒树立为革命种田思想
    据新华社石家庄一日电　河北省抚宁县卢王庄公社桃园大队贫下中农和革命干部，在驻军毛泽东思想宣传队的帮助下，以毛泽东思想为武器，在春耕期间继续深入开展群众性的革命大批判，彻底肃清中国赫鲁晓夫和他的老婆王××在这个大队所散布的反革命经济主义的流毒，树立大寨人自力更生、艰苦奋斗的革命精神，有力地推动了春耕生产。
    桃园大队，是中国赫鲁晓夫在这里炮制臭名昭著的“桃园经验”的一个大队。这个大队的贫下中农和革命干部，在史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命运动开展以后，以毛泽东思想这一无比锐利的武器，口诛笔伐，对中国赫鲁晓夫和他的老婆王××展开了大控诉、大揭发、大批判、大斗争。一年多来，桃园大队贫下中农共召开各种批判会一千三百多次，开辟街头“大批判专栏”七个，写大字报一万多张，狠揭狠批了中国赫鲁晓夫和他的老婆王××在这个大队所犯下的滔天罪行。
    在当前春耕大忙季节中，驻当地解放军毛泽东思想宣传队的同志，又帮助桃园大队贫下中农和革命干部认真学习了毛主席的“政治工作是一切经济工作的生命线”和“将革命进行到底”的伟大教导，进一步深入地开展革命的大批判。革命大批判的阵地——毛泽东思想学习班，由原来的九个增加到六十多个；由原来只是大队、生产队办，发展到院户都办。社员群众和革命干部集中火力，结合春耕生产中的问题，以本大队的具体事实，有的放矢地批判了中国赫鲁晓夫和他的老婆在桃园所散布的“物质刺激”、“工分挂帅”、“利润挂帅”等反革命经济主义谬论。他们说，中国赫鲁晓夫指派他的老婆王××拿国家的大量资财投到桃园大队，大搞物质刺激、工分挂帅、利润挂帅，结果使这个大队在四清中和四清后粮食逐年减产，没有完成国家征购任务。一九六七年，因为大力突出无产阶级政治，活学活用毛泽东思想，开展革命大批判，学习大寨人的革命精神，艰苦奋斗，夺得了农业空前大丰收，超额完成了国家的征购任务。
    通过革命的大批判，大队的贫下中农和革命干部进一步认识到反革命经济主义的危害性，更加看清了中国赫鲁晓夫反对社会主义、妄图复辟资本主义的狼子野心，从而对中国赫鲁晓夫和他的老婆更加仇恨，对伟大领袖毛主席更加热爱。贫下中农说，中国赫鲁晓夫搞的物质刺激，是吗啡针，是糖衣炮弹，是给我们灌输资产阶级“私”字。我们要彻底砸烂反革命经济主义，树立自力更生、艰苦奋斗的革命精神和为革命种田的无产阶级“公”字，坚决走伟大领袖毛主席指引的社会主义光明大道。
    革命的大批判推动了春耕生产。广大贫下中农和革命干部坚决响应毛主席“农业学大寨”的伟大号召，以大寨为榜样，破私立公，为革命种田。社员们全部出勤，春耕生产搞得热火朝天。过去一直没参加过集体生产的四十多名家庭妇女，现在也走上了春耕生产第一线。她们说：我们出工不是为了挣几个工分，而是为了实现毛主席“备战、备荒、为人民”的伟大战略方针，为了多打粮食，支援无产阶级文化大革命，支援祖国的社会主义建设，支援世界革命。上级今年分配给桃园大队二百七十个工的修整受益水渠的任务，他们高唱着毛主席语录歌上工，在毛主席“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利”的教导鼓舞下，起五更，睡半夜，仅用二百个工就完成了任务。过去，这一带地方春季育地瓜秧要用优质煤烧育秧炕，桃园大队每年向国家要煤三十多吨。今年，社员们在毛泽东思想学习班里，学习了毛主席“要进一步节约闹革命”的教导，专门讨论了这个问题。社员们说，咱们站在桃园，应该想到全国，能节约的要尽量节约。他们采用代用品，没有向国家要煤，仍然按照种植计划完成了育地瓜秧的任务。目前，这个大队春耕生产形势大好，春播肥料已全部送到地里，稻田、渠道已全部平整、修好，越冬小麦锄了一遍，春播地已经开犁。
