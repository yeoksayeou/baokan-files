The struggle of Chilean workers and peasants against the exploitation and oppression by U.S. monopolies and local landlords is continuing to develop.

On April 16, 7,500 Chilean power workers began a two-day strike demanding wage increases. Eighty percent of the striking workers are employed by the American-controlled power company that dominates Chile's power generation.

At the same time, the strike by more than 60,000 national school teachers and postal workers has entered its 20th day.

In the capital, Santiago, and various provinces, 7,000 municipal workers, textile workers in the Tome region, and workers at the coastal chocolate factory in Valparaiso have also gone on strike in late March and early April.

In recent continuous strikes across various industries, Chilean workers have strongly protested the government's regulations on freezing wage increases and paying part of the increased wages with national bonds. Limiting wage increases is a key component of the economic plan imposed on Chile by the International Monetary Fund, which is controlled by the United States. This measure benefits the exploitation of Chilean workers by U.S. monopolies. In recent times, U.S. monopolies, under the guise of "joint ventures" with Chilean capital, have continued to aggressively enter the country. According to official Chilean reports, in March alone, foreign companies, mainly American, invested $500,000 in Chile's metallurgy, textiles, and plastics sectors. The strengthening of U.S. economic plunder is devastating Chile's national industries and continually worsening the living conditions of the Chilean working people.

In the countryside, over 43,000 peasant households in the Curico province established a unified command center on April 12 to coordinate their struggle against the landlords.

Previously, 3,000 peasants from 49 estates in Santiago province went on strike at the end of March, demanding improved living conditions.

    反对美国垄断资本和本国大庄园主的残酷压榨
    智利广大工农群众纷纷罢工
    据新华社十七日讯  圣地亚哥消息：智利工人、农民反对美国垄断资本和本国大庄园主的剥削和压迫的斗争正在继续发展。
    十六日，七千五百名智利电力工人开始举行为期两天的罢工，要求增加工资。罢工工人中百分之八十是控制智利电力生产的美国电力公司的工人。
    同时，六万多名国立学校教师和邮电职工的罢工已经进入第二十天。
    智利首都圣地亚哥和各省的七千名市政工人、托梅地区的纺织工人和瓦尔帕莱索的海岸巧克力厂的工人，也在三月底和四月初纷纷举行罢工。
    智利各行业职工在最近连续举行的罢工中，还一致强烈抗议当局关于冻结工资增长率和用国家债券支付部分增加的工资的规定。限制增加工资，是美国控制的国际货币基金组织强加于智利的经济计划的重要内容之一，这项措施有利于美国垄断资本对智利工人的剥削。最近一个时期以来，美国垄断资本在同智利资本“联营”的掩护下，继续大举侵入这个国家。据智利官方消息，仅在今年三月，主要是美国资本的外国公司在智利冶金、纺织和塑料等部门的新投资就达到五十万美元。美国经济掠夺的加强，摧残着智利的民族工业，使智利劳动人民的生活条件不断恶化。
    在农村，库里科省的四万三千多户农民在十二日建立一个统一指挥部，来协调他们反对大庄园主的斗争。
    在这以前，圣地亚哥省四十九个庄园的三千名农民在三月底举行罢工，要求改善生活条件。
