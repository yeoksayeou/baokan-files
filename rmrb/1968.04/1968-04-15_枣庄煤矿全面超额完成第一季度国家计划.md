Under the call to fully achieve victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the revolutionary workers of the Zaozhuang Mining Bureau in Shandong Province have used Mao Zedong Thought to guide their revolution and production. Through the establishment of Mao Zedong Thought study classes, they have engaged in self-criticism and the criticism of revisionism, promoting the ideological transformation of the people. The entire bureau has fully exceeded the national plan for the first quarter of this year, with the average daily coal production increasing by more than two percent compared to the fourth quarter of last year.
