		Newspaper reports from Melbourne, April 16: Chairman Hill of the Australian Communist Party (Marxist-Leninist) recently published an article in the *Vanguard* newspaper, warmly praising the establishment of revolutionary committees in various parts of China.

		Hill wrote: "Every revolutionary committee that is established is a great victory for the dictatorship of the proletariat, a great victory for the proletarian line, and a great defeat for the bourgeois dictatorship and the bourgeois line. This is a great victory for the line of Chairman Mao, and a heavy defeat for the line of the Chinese Khrushchev."

		Hill said: "In China, in the provinces where revolutionary committees have already been established, the people are enthusiastically celebrating the birth of the revolutionary committees, and the people of the entire country are expressing their heartfelt congratulations. This is the cause of the masses, the cause of the people themselves."

		Hill pointed out that through the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the dictatorship of the proletariat in China has been greatly consolidated.

		Hill said, "The imperialist countries are very uneasy because the Chinese Khrushchev has been overthrown. They are also very uneasy because their spies and agents have been caught. Chairman Mao is right: 'Whatever the enemy opposes, we support.'"

		Hill concluded: "The revolutionary people of the whole world are genuinely delighted to see the great victory of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought embodied in the establishment of revolutionary committees in various parts of China, and they are genuinely delighted to see the failure of imperialism, modern revisionism, and their various agents."

    澳共（马列）主席希尔热情赞扬我各地成立革命委员会
    中国文化大革命大大巩固无产阶级专政
    新华社墨尔本十六日电　澳大利亚共产党（马克思列宁主义）主席希尔最近在《先锋报》上发表文章，热情赞扬中国各地相继建立革命委员会。
    希尔写道：“每建立一个革命委员会，都是无产阶级专政的伟大胜利，都是无产阶级路线的伟大胜利，都是资产阶级专政和资产阶级路线的惨败。这是毛主席路线的伟大胜利，是中国赫鲁晓夫路线的惨重失败。”
    希尔说：“在中国，已经成立了革命委员会的省份，人民热情洋溢地庆祝革命委员会的胜利诞生，全国人民也以满腔热情表示祝贺。这是群众的事业，是人民自己的事业。”
    希尔指出，通过无产阶级文化大革命，中国的无产阶级专政大大巩固了。
    希尔说，帝国主义国家“由于中国赫鲁晓夫被打倒而非常不安。它们由于自己的间谍特务落网而非常不安。毛主席说得对：‘凡是敌人反对的，我们就要拥护’。”
    希尔最后说：“全世界的革命人民看到马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想如此光辉地体现在中国各地纷纷建立革命委员会方面的伟大胜利而由衷地感到高兴，看到帝国主义、现代修正主义及其形形色色的代理人的失败而由衷地感到高兴。”
