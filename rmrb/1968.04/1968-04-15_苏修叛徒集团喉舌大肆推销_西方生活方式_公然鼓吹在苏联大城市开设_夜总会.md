The Soviet revisionist traitor clique's mouthpiece is vigorously promoting the Western lifestyle and openly advocating for the establishment of "nightclubs" in major Soviet cities.

The People's Daily reports: On March 27, the Soviet revisionist *Literaturnaya Gazeta* published an article titled "Cities Are Also Active at Night," openly advocating for the establishment of "nightclubs" in various major Soviet cities.

This article vigorously promotes the "benefits" of "nightclubs," claiming that people can eat, drink, chat, and laugh there, and "do whatever they want." The author even shamelessly says, "Our (foreign) guests need 'nightclubs,'" because "a guest in a foreign land feels particularly lonely at night." This article fully exposes the Soviet revisionist traitor clique's evil intentions in vigorously promoting the decadent Western lifestyle and hastening the restoration of capitalism.

In fact, under the rule of the Soviet revisionist traitor clique, some major Soviet cities have already seen the emergence of disguised "nightclubs" in recent years.

The American monopolistic capitalist mouthpiece *Life* magazine's correspondent in Moscow, Peter Yan, wrote in an article last November, "In Leningrad alone, eight jazz clubs have been established and six new youth cafes have opened in the past two years." A deputy president of the Supreme Court of the Russian Federation admitted, "Many young people spend their time in cafes littered with empty bottles day and night."

    苏修叛徒集团喉舌大肆推销“西方生活方式”
    公然鼓吹在苏联大城市开设“夜总会”
    本报讯　苏修《文学报》在三月二十七日发表一篇题为《城市在夜间也活跃》的文章，公然鼓吹在苏联各大城市普遍开办“夜总会”。
    这篇文章竭力宣扬“夜总会”的好处，说什么人们在那里可以吃吃喝喝，说说笑笑，“谁愿意干什么就干什么”。作者甚至还无耻地说，“我们的（外国）客人需要‘夜总会’”，因为“一个客人身在异域，夜晚会特别感到孤单。”这篇文章充分暴露了苏修叛徒集团大肆推销腐朽的西方生活方式、加紧复辟资本主义的罪恶嘴脸。
    其实，在苏修叛徒集团的统治下，苏联一些大城市中近年来早已出现一些变相的“夜总会”。
    美国垄断资本的喉舌《生活》杂志驻莫斯科记者彼得·扬在去年十一月间的一篇报道中就写道，“单是在列宁格勒，过去两年里就成立了八个爵士乐俱乐部，新开了六家青年咖啡馆。”俄罗斯联邦最高法院的一个副院长承认，“许多年轻人日夜在酒瓶狼藉的咖啡馆里消磨时光”。
