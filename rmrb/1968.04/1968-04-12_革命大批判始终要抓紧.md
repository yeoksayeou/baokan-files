The great criticism of the revolution must always be tightened. That small handful of capitalist roaders within the party are not "dead tigers," but living tigers. They are always preparing to stage a comeback. The counter-revolutionary crimes of China's Khrushchov and the other top capitalist roaders within the party, along with their agents, have not been thoroughly settled, and the poison of the counter-revolutionary revisionist line they have been pushing has not been thoroughly eliminated. If we do not launch an attack on the class enemy, the class enemy will attack us. If you do not crush it, it will crush you. The revolutionary committees must never forget this for a moment.

"One of the important tasks on our ideological front now is to launch a criticism of revisionism." We must firmly grasp the initiative in the struggle against the enemy, strike from a commanding height, and launch relentless attacks on the enemy.

Launching a great criticism of the revolution is a very important part of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. If we do not thoroughly criticize and expose bourgeois ideology, it will still have a market in people's minds. Then, under certain conditions, the whole set of revisionism will seize the opportunity to stage a comeback. We must never underestimate this danger.

The great criticism of the revolution must be combined with the situation and tasks, and with the struggle-criticism-transformation in each unit, to promote the development of other work through the great criticism of the revolution. Every matter can be, and should be, combined with the great criticism of the revolution. Experience has shown that by focusing on the great criticism of the revolution, we can greatly consolidate the great alliance of the revolution, consolidate the three-in-one combination, and consolidate the new revolutionary committees.

Launching a great criticism of the revolution is the current direction of the struggle. To truly become a battle command post with proletarian authority, the revolutionary committees must firmly grasp the direction of the struggle and, under leadership and with a plan, carry out a mass great criticism of the revolution, always aiming at China's Khrushchov and his agents, and at various bourgeois reactionary trends. Only in this way can we lead the masses to keep moving forward and fully implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions.

### 革命大批判始终要抓紧

    革命大批判始终要抓紧
    那一小撮党内走资派，决不是“死老虎”，而是活老虎。他们每时每刻都在准备复辟。中国赫鲁晓夫等党内最大的一小撮走资派及其代理人的反革命滔天罪行，还远远没有彻底清算，他们所推行的反革命修正主义路线的流毒，还远远没有彻底肃清。我们若不对阶级敌人发动进攻，阶级敌人就向我们进攻，你不压倒它，它就压倒你。革命委员会一时一刻也不能忘记
  “我们现在思想战线上的一个重要任务，就是要开展对于修正主义的批判。”一定要把对敌斗争的主动权牢牢地掌握在自己手里，高屋建瓴，势如破竹，不断向敌人发动猛烈的进攻。
    开展革命的大批判，是无产阶级文化大革命的一个极其重要的内容。不彻底把资产阶级思想批倒批臭，在人的头脑里还有市场，那么，在一定的气候下，修正主义的一套就会伺机复辟。我们决不可低估这种危险性。
    革命的大批判一定要结合形势和任务，结合本单位的斗批改，通过革命的大批判推动其他各项工作的开展。每一项事情，都可以、都应该和革命大批判结合起来。事实证明，抓了革命的大批判，就能大大巩固革命的大联合，巩固革命的三结合，巩固新生的革命委员会。
    开展革命大批判是当前斗争的大方向。革命委员会要真正成为有无产阶级权威的战斗司令部，就必须牢牢掌握斗争的大方向，有领导、有计划地深入开展群众性的革命大批判，始终把矛头对准中国赫鲁晓夫及其代理人，对准形形色色的资产阶级反动思潮。这样做，才能率领群众不断前进，才能全面落实毛主席的最新指示。
