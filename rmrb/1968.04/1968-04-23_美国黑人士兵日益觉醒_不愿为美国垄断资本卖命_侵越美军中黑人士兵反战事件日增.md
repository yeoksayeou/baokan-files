As the struggle of the American people against the U.S. imperialist aggression in Vietnam continues to surge and the American black people's anti-violence struggle flourishes, black soldiers in the U.S. invading forces in South Vietnam are increasingly awakening. Incidents of black soldiers refusing to fight are on the rise.

In recent years, U.S. imperialism has suffered repeated defeats in South Vietnam, leading to severe shortages of troops and dwindling manpower. In a desperate attempt to salvage the situation, the U.S. ruling class has intensified conscription at home, particularly through various brutal methods, forcing large numbers of blacks to go to the South Vietnamese battlefield to fight for them.

However, these evil measures by the U.S. ruling class have met with strong opposition from the broad masses of the American people and the increasingly awakened black population. Many blacks have taken to the streets, holding demonstrations and marches to protest being sent to South Vietnam as tools of U.S. aggression. Their slogan is: "Rather go to jail or be sentenced than go to South Vietnam to participate in the war of aggression." Last year, Hershey, the head of the U.S. Selective Service, went to Howard University, where black students make up the overwhelming majority, to give a speech, attempting to lure black students to go to South Vietnam to die. Angry students immediately chased him off the stage, causing the scoundrel to flee in disgrace amidst the angry shouts of the crowd. Blacks in the U.S. have also established anti-war and anti-conscription organizations in places like Los Angeles and Chicago, actively organizing activities in black communities, such as holding various meetings, demonstrating in front of conscription offices, or screening anti-war films, and distributing anti-conscription leaflets to eligible black conscripts. These organizations call on blacks not to go to South Vietnam to die but to stay in the U.S., stay in the black ghettos, and fight for freedom.

U.S. imperialism not only practices racial discrimination against blacks at home but also discriminates against black soldiers on the South Vietnamese battlefield, making them carry out the most arduous and dangerous tasks and serve as cannon fodder. As the U.S. sinks deeper into the quagmire of the Vietnam War and suffers more devastating defeats, incidents of black soldiers in the U.S. invading forces refusing to carry out combat orders are on the rise. According to the Liberation Radio of South Vietnam, in August last year, when the people's liberation armed forces in Quang Nam Province launched a fierce attack on the U.S. forces in the Phuoc Long area, the U.S. Marine Corps stationed in the province hastily dispatched a company of black soldiers to rescue them. However, after the helicopter dropped the company of black U.S. soldiers, they immediately sat down and refused to carry out the combat orders. In addition, the number of black soldiers in South Vietnam who desert because they do not want to continue fighting for the U.S. ruling class is increasing. A black soldier named McKinley Nolan, after realizing the unjust nature of the U.S. aggression in Vietnam, resolutely left the U.S. military and joined the liberation zone in South Vietnam. He also called on black soldiers in the U.S. military not to continue fighting for the U.S. government, to take immediate action, and join the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam.

The U.S. ruling class is very frightened by the growing anti-war sentiment among black soldiers in the U.S. invading forces. They have adopted various means of deception and suppression against black soldiers in an attempt to stabilize their morale. However, all these efforts are increasingly ineffective, and the number of black soldiers in the U.S. invading forces who are disillusioned and oppose the Vietnam War is on the rise.

### 美国黑人士兵日益觉醒　不愿为美国垄断资本卖命  侵越美军中黑人士兵反战事件日增

    美国黑人士兵日益觉醒　不愿为美国垄断资本卖命
    侵越美军中黑人士兵反战事件日增
    新华社二十二日讯　随着美国人民反对美帝侵略越南战争的斗争浪潮不断高涨和美国黑人抗暴斗争的蓬勃发展，被美国统治集团送去南越充当炮灰的侵越美军中的黑人士兵也日益觉醒，黑人士兵抗拒作战的事件不断发生。
    近年来，美帝国主义由于在南越战场上连遭惨败，兵力严重不足，兵源日益枯竭。为了进行垂死挣扎，妄图挽救败局，美国统治集团在国内加紧征兵，特别是通过各种野蛮方式，强迫大批黑人到南越战场为它们卖命。
    但是，美国统治集团的这种罪恶措施，遭到美国国内广大人民和日益觉醒的黑人群众的强烈反对。许多黑人冲上街头，举行示威游行，反对去南越充当美国统治集团的侵略工具。他们的口号是：宁愿坐牢和判刑，也决不到南越去参加侵略战争。美国征兵局头子赫尔希去年曾到黑人学生占绝大多数的霍华德大学演说，企图诱骗黑人学生到南越去送死。愤怒的学生立即把他赶下了讲台，使这个坏家伙在群众激愤的口号声中，狼狈不堪地溜走了。美国黑人还在洛杉矶、芝加哥等地成立了反侵略战争、反征兵等组织，在黑人地区积极展开活动，如经常举行各种集会，在征兵站前示威或放映反侵越战争的电影，向适龄应征黑人散发反征兵传单等。这些组织呼吁黑人不要到南越去送死，而是留在美国、留在黑人的贫民窟里为自由而战斗。
    美帝国主义不仅在国内对黑人实行种族歧视，在南越战场上也同样对黑人士兵实行歧视，要他们去执行最繁重最危险的任务，充当替死鬼。随着美帝在侵越战争泥潭中越陷越深，失败越来越惨重，侵越美军中的黑人士兵反抗上级作战命令的事件不断发生。据越南南方解放通讯社报道，去年八月间，当广南省人民解放武装力量猛烈进攻先福地区的美军时，驻在这个省的美国海军陆战队曾慌忙派遣一连黑人士兵前往救援，但是，当直升飞机把这一连黑人美军空投下来之后，他们就进行静坐斗争，拒绝执行作战命令。此外在南越的黑人士兵中因不愿继续为美国统治集团卖命而开小差逃跑的人数也越来越多。一名叫麦克金里诺兰的黑人士兵，在认清美帝侵越战争的非正义性之后，毅然脱离美军队伍，投奔越南南方解放区。他还呼吁美军中的黑人士兵不要再为美国政府卖命，迅速采取行动，投奔越南南方民族解放阵线。
    美国统治集团对侵越美军中的黑人士兵日益增长的厌战和反对侵越战争的情绪，十分害怕。它们对黑人士兵采取种种诱骗和镇压的手段，妄图稳定他们的士气。但是，这一切日益失灵，侵越美军中的黑人士兵厌战和反战的人正在不断增多。
