The wave of black people's anti-violence struggles in the United States, which began on the evening of April 4th and lasted until the 9th, has swept through 110 large and small cities in the United States.

The brave struggle of the black masses has made the U.S. imperialism, which has suffered heavy losses in the Vietnam War, even more embarrassed. Due to a shortage of troops, the U.S. Department of Defense announced on the 8th that it would temporarily suspend the plan to send an additional 14,000 troops to the battlefield in South Vietnam, attempting to use heavy troops to brutally suppress the black anti-violence struggles.

According to reports, in the past few days, the U.S. ruling authorities have mobilized 55,000 troops and National Guard to work with local police to brutally suppress the black masses. In addition, 22,000 regular army troops are ready to be sent to various cities to suppress the blacks at any time. However, brutal suppression not only fails to intimidate the brave black masses but also further awakens them and strengthens their fighting will. They fearlessly continue to strike back at the reactionary military police and white racists.

In the U.S. imperialism's lair, Washington, many streets have been turned into ruins by the fires set by the black masses. The black masses, filled with anger over the atrocities of white racists, smashed the windows of many shops and residences near the White House, despite police suppression. The frightened Johnson administration has successively dispatched more than 13,000 troops, paratroopers, and marines to assist the National Guard and police in brutally suppressing the blacks. In the face of reactionary violence, the black masses continue to fight bravely and intelligently, injuring 70 to 80 reactionary military police. At night, they also sneakily snipe at the reactionary military police.

The black masses in Baltimore bravely fought against violence for four consecutive days. On the morning of the 8th, due to the police shooting and killing a black person, the other black brothers, filled with indignation, set fire to the shops of white racists in a quarter of the city, smashed the shop windows, and avenged the death of their black brother. The black masses also set fire in more than 500 places. Black snipers opened fire and bravely fought back against the reactionary military police who released tear gas.

In Pittsburgh, despite the presence of more than 2,000 fully armed National Guardsmen patrolling the city, groups of black masses still bravely took to the streets, smashing and burning the shops of white racists in 20 blocks. On the 8th, the entire city had 200 fires.

In Nashville, the capital of Tennessee, black students at the state university set fire to a large building of the Air Force Reserve Officer Training Corps on the campus. Black youth in Joliet, Illinois, set fire to three warehouses and bravely lay down in the streets to prevent the fire department from putting out the fires. The black masses in Des Moines set fire to six buildings of white racists using Molotov cocktails. In Wilmington, North Carolina, black youth fought bravely with military police armed with bayonets and tear gas using stones.

The awakened black masses in the United States fearlessly continue to fight bravely despite suppression. This is a black youth in Pittsburgh, filled with indignation, fighting against the fully armed National Guard.

    美帝疯狂镇压黑人斗争，使兵力更短缺，不得不宣布暂缓执行增兵南越计划
    新华社九日讯　华盛顿消息：波澜壮阔的美国黑人群众抗暴斗争，从四日晚上开始到九日为止，已经席卷美国一百一十个大小城市。
    黑人群众的英勇斗争使得在侵越战争中碰得头破血流的美帝国主义的处境更加狼狈不堪。由于兵力短缺，美国国防部八日宣布，暂缓执行增派一万四千多名侵略军到南越战场的计划，妄图用重兵残酷镇压的手段来扑灭黑人抗暴斗争的烈火。
    据报道，几天来，美国统治当局抽调了五万五千名陆军和国民警卫队，配合各地警察部队野蛮镇压黑人群众。另外还有二万二千名陆军正规军准备随时开往各城市对黑人进行镇压。但是，残暴的镇压不仅吓不倒英勇的黑人群众，而且进一步促进了他们的觉醒，增强了他们的斗争意志。他们不畏强暴，继续给反动军警和白人种族主义者以狠狠的打击。
    在美帝国主义的老巢华盛顿，许多街区已经被黑人群众点燃的大火烧成了废墟。对白人种族主义暴行怀着满腔怒火的黑人群众，不顾警察的镇压，把白宫附近的许多商店和住宅的窗户砸得稀烂。胆战心惊的约翰逊政府连日来陆续增调陆军、伞兵和海军陆战队共一万三千多名配合国民警卫队和警察对黑人进行野蛮镇压。在反动的暴力面前，黑人群众仍然英勇机智地坚持斗争，共打伤反动军警七、八十人。夜里，他们还神出鬼没地对反动军警进行狙击。
    巴尔的摩的黑人群众接连四天英勇地坚持抗暴斗争。八日上午，由于警察开枪打死一名黑人群众，其他的黑人弟兄们怀着满腔的悲愤，在全城四分之一的地区放火烧白人种族主义者的商店，砸烂商店的橱窗，为死难的黑人弟兄报仇。黑人群众还在五百多处燃起大火。黑人狙击手开枪英勇还击向他们施放了催泪瓦斯的反动军警。
    在匹兹堡，尽管两千多名全副武装的国民警卫队在全城各地巡逻，但是成群结队的黑人群众仍然勇敢地走上街头，把二十个街区的白人种族主义者商店砸烂烧毁。八日全市共有两百处起火。
    在田纳西州首府纳什维尔，州立大学的黑人学生放火烧毁了校园里空军后备军官训练队的一座大厦。伊利诺斯州乔利埃特的黑人青年放火烧了三座仓库，并英勇地卧倒在街上，阻止消防队前往救火。得梅因的黑人群众用燃烧瓶放火烧掉了六处白人种族主义者的建筑物。在北卡罗来纳州的威尔明敦，黑人青年用石块同带着刺刀、施放催泪瓦斯的军警进行了英勇搏斗。（附图片）
    觉醒了的美国黑人群众不畏强暴，不怕镇压，继续英勇战斗。这是美国匹兹堡的黑人青年怀着满腔怒火同全副武装的国民警卫队进行斗争。
