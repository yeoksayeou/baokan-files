The Chinese Khrushchev is a thoroughgoing traitor and scab.

— Old workers who participated in the Anshun Road and Mine Strike and soldiers and officers of a certain unit of the PLA criticize the reactionary film "Spark"

Old workers who participated in the Anshun Road and Mine Strike and soldiers and officers of a certain unit of the PLA, after watching the reactionary film "Spark," were extremely indignant and unanimously denounced the heinous crimes committed by the Chinese Khrushchev in the 1920s. They provided ample evidence that the Chinese Khrushchev was never a "labor leader" but an unmitigated scab and thoroughgoing traitor.

The reactionary film "Spark" is a textbook of historical distortion

Xushengyuan (an old worker who participated in the Anshun Road and Mine Strike and the Autumn Harvest Uprising):

This bad movie, "Spark," the more I watch it, the angrier I get. The Chinese Khrushchev is clearly a black crow, but the film insists on dressing him up as a "golden phoenix." No matter how much the filmmakers try to beautify him, they cannot deceive us old workers who are loyal to Chairman Mao.

I remember that as early as the autumn of 1921, our beloved Chairman Mao walked to Anshun. The next day, Chairman Mao visited the thatched huts, went down into the mines, and among the workers, asking about their hardships and making friends with us. He also propagated revolutionary ideas, educating the workers to unite as one, to twist into a rope, and to fight the capitalists with one heart. Chairman Mao's words are deeply engraved in our hearts, and the brilliance of Mao Zedong Thought shines brightly in our hearts. We workers also composed a song to enthusiastically praise Chairman Mao:

Until 1921, the fog suddenly dissipated and the sky cleared.
There was a capable person, Mao Runzhi, who came from Hunan to Anshun.
He talked with the workers, relieved our sufferings, and did not make things difficult.
He proposed to establish a union, and the labor community united as one.

Based on Chairman Mao's teachings, we Anshun workers quickly organized, established night schools, formed unions, developed party members, and built party branches. In 1922, Chairman Mao came to Anshun and personally organized the great strike. We followed Chairman Mao's instructions and held the great strike on September 14th. After five days and nights of struggle, we achieved victory. The decision to hold the great strike was made by Chairman Mao, the deployment was planned by Chairman Mao, the slogans were raised by Chairman Mao, and the victory of the great strike was the victory of the great Mao Zedong Thought. However, the reactionary film "Spark" did not mention Chairman Mao at all, erasing Chairman Mao's great achievements completely. In the film, the words "1921" flashed by, and out came Lei Huanjue. This incarnation of the Chinese Khrushchev, upon arriving in Anshun, immediately set up a sign to establish a night school, as if he were actively doing things for us workers. In reality, this was all fabricated. The Chinese Khrushchev only arrived in Anshun two days before the strike was fully prepared. After arriving, he promoted a line of "opposition, suppression, and betrayal" opportunism. How could the victory of this great strike, which shocked the world, be credited to him! The Chinese Khrushchev instructed his black henchmen, such as Xia Yan, to maliciously distort history and paste gold on his own face. This is utterly shameless and extremely reactionary!

Peng Youqin (an old worker who participated in the Anshun Strike and the Autumn Harvest Uprising):

What Old Xu said is all true. After the victory of the great strike, Chairman Mao continued to care for the struggles of the Anshun workers. We followed Chairman Mao closely, some participated in the Autumn Harvest Uprising led by Chairman Mao, and some followed Chairman Mao to Mount Jinggang. Under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, we moved from victory to victory. The reactionary film "Spark," however, distorted right and wrong, attributing Chairman Mao's great achievements to the Chinese Khrushchev. When the film was being shot, we raised questions: Why not mention Chairman Mao? They said we "don't understand art." It turns out that their "art" is to distort history and beautify the Chinese Khrushchev. More than forty years ago, we old workers clearly remember what the Chinese Khrushchev did in Anshun. At that time, we old workers gave him the following evaluation: "His work spirit is not good, overly cautious, and his usual interactions and conversations with fellow workers show a lazy and unwilling attitude. He does not take his duties seriously... These are his mistakes." The Chinese Khrushchev was high above, never in contact with the workers, but instead was very close with the capitalists. We workers have long hated him to the core.

Song Qishun (an active learner of Chairman Mao's works, squad leader):

Old workers are the best witnesses to the history of the Anshun struggle. Ironclad facts prove: the revolutionary spark of Anshun was personally ignited by Chairman Mao; the decision to hold the Anshun Strike was personally made by Chairman Mao; the victory of the Anshun workers' struggle was the blossoming of Mao Zedong Thought. However, the reactionary film "Spark" did not mention Chairman Mao's instructions to the Anshun Road and Mine workers' movement from beginning to end, did not hear a word from Chairman Mao, and did not even see Chairman Mao's name. The great teacher Chairman Mao taught us: those who infiltrate the party, government, military, and various cultural circles as representatives of the bourgeoisie are a group of counter-revolutionary revisionists. Once the time is ripe, they will seize power, turning proletarian dictatorship into bourgeois dictatorship. The counter-revolutionary revisionists Xia Yan and others, following the black instructions of their black master, the Chinese Khrushchev, blatantly distorted history, all for the purpose of creating public opinion to restore capitalism for the Chinese Khrushchev. The Chinese Khrushchev, under the guise of "writing more mining history to educate the youth," instructed his henchmen to write extensively about the "revolutionary struggle history" and "memoirs" of Anshun, as well as plays, novels, films, and songs to praise his merits. He repeatedly instructed to build his so-called "historical relics," "memorials," and "memorial halls" in Anshun, attempting to turn the Anshun Club into his "family temple" and build a "merit stele" for himself. He also instigated his lackeys to give distorted historical reports in Beijing, sparing no effort to gain political capital for himself. In 1962, when domestic and foreign class enemies were stirring and ghosts and monsters were emerging, the reactionary film "Spark" and the poisonous weed "Cultivation" both emerged. This is not a coincidence in history, but a great exposure of the Chinese Khrushchev's long-cherished ambition to usurp the party, the army, and the government.

The Chinese Khrushchev is a running dog of the comprador capitalists

Tan Fusheng (an old worker from the Anshun Strike, an old Red Army soldier):

The poisonous weed "Spark" praises the incarnation of the Chinese Khrushchev, Lei Huanjue, as the "leader" of the workers' movement and a "hero" who bravely fights against the capitalists. This is all bragging by the filmmakers. In reality, the Chinese Khrushchev is a traitor who sells out the interests of the workers and a running dog of the capitalists. He did not lead the workers in political struggles when he came to Anshun. Instead, he constantly promoted "economism" with a foreign accent, trying to blind us with a few "counterfeit mining tickets," making the workers kneel before the capitalists to beg for a few rotten coins, and attempting to buy the hearts of the working class with small favors. We did not listen to his nonsense at all!

Under the leadership of Chairman Mao, the revolutionary flames of our political struggles in Anshun burned more fiercely. The Chinese Khrushchev was terrified and said nonsense about how political struggles and seizing power were "distant realities," and that "increasing wages and reducing working hours, this economic struggle" was the "only urgent goal." This guy raised the reactionary banner of "economicism," using every means to limit our revolutionary actions. He also parroted orders to call for a return to work, saying: "You've been on strike for days, you should go to work and produce more coal. The capitalists are losing money, and you won't even have porridge to eat." This Chinese Khrushchev was like this, encouraging the capitalists and discouraging the workers, blatantly promoting the bourgeois theory of "exploitation is meritorious" and "capitalists feed workers." He was afraid that our political struggles would touch the capitalists' paradise, repeatedly declaring that the strike was "for food," "for survival," and "had nothing to do with political and military issues."

The "economism" promoted by the Chinese Khrushchev is opium that numbs the people and poison that harms the workers, a soft knife that strangles the workers' movement. As a result of the Chinese Khrushchev's opportunist line, in September 1925, when the comprador capitalists colluded with the warlords to strike at us, the workers' club was completely unprepared, resulting in the club being severely damaged, many cadres and workers being arrested and killed; thousands of workers were expelled. Under the soft knife of the Chinese Khrushchev's reactionary economism, how many workers lost their lives, and how many workers were persecuted. This blood debt we must settle!

Li Youde (an old railway worker who participated in the Anshun Strike, an old Red Army soldier):

This old opportunist, the Chinese Khrushchev, as soon as he came to Anshun, immediately threw himself into the arms of the capitalists, becoming a loyal running dog of the comprador capitalists. When the Hanyang-Pingxiang Company was on the verge of bankruptcy, the capitalists threatened the workers, saying: "If Hanyang-Pingxiang goes bankrupt, the workers will starve to death." The Chinese Khrushchev also jumped out to echo: "The existence or non-existence of Hanyang-Pingxiang is related to the livelihood of hundreds of thousands of people." The capitalists forced us workers to produce more coal to "rescue" their Hanyang-Pingxiang Company, and the Chinese Khrushchev immediately followed suit, shouting: "Chinese people... The largest foundation of Chinese industry, Hanyang-Pingxiang, is about to stop production and go bankrupt! Hurry up and rescue it!" Master and servant, how harmonious! The Chinese Khrushchev's "enthusiasm" for maintaining the capitalists' industry was appreciated by the capitalists. The capitalists warmly requested to jointly "create a new era of close cooperation between labor and capital" with the club. Look, how intimate the Chinese Khrushchev was with the capitalists, how harmonious their cooperation was! Even after liberation, the reactionary capitalist and former manager of Anshun Mine, Shu Xiutai, wrote a letter to the Chinese Khrushchev, thanking him for his past "mediation." Look, how deep the friendship between the comprador capitalists and the number one traitor!

The Chinese Khrushchev loves the comprador capitalists, hates the working class, does the capitalists' work, and drinks the workers' blood. He is an unmitigated traitor.

Zhang Detian (an active learner of Chairman Mao's works, a soldier):

The reactionary film "Spark" crazily promotes the Chinese Khrushchev's revisionist black goods of "labor-capital cooperation," erasing class and class struggle. During the Anshun Strike, he once said: "I have no grudge against the capitalists." One sentence revealed the secret. The Chinese Khrushchev and the capitalists not only have no "grudge," but are very close! The Chinese Khrushchev of the 1920s, was he a "labor leader" or a traitor? He himself had long since made the conclusion!

Workers and capitalists, peasants and landlords are two hostile classes, and their relationship is a life-and-death class struggle. There is no way for workers and peasants to live if there is a landlord and capitalist heaven. The Chinese Khrushchev, however, insisted on "cooperation" between workers and capitalists. Isn't this calling for us to surrender to the enemy? We workers and peasants have a deep-seated hatred for capitalists and landlords. The capitalists' and landlords' heaven is built on the bones of us workers and peasants. The history of the landlords and capitalists is the history of our workers and peasants' blood and tears. "Young people enter the coal shed, old people carry bamboo tubes, sick people are driven away, and dead people are worse than dogs." This is the true portrayal of the Anshun coal miners' deep suffering under capitalist oppression in the old society. We workers and peasants have a thousand grievances and a million hatreds. We remember the class bitterness and do not forget the blood debt. Today, we workers and peasants have risen to become masters, and we must seize the politics of the bourgeoisie and landlord class. Let the sons and grandsons of the capitalists and landlords, the Chinese Khrushchev, go to hell!

The Chinese Khrushchev is a traitor who sells out the interests of the workers

Tan Fusheng:

The Chinese Khrushchev is a thoroughgoing "high-level strategist" of the comprador capitalists. In 1924, he threw out a poisonous weed, the "Opinions on Rectifying the Pingxiang Mine," suggesting that the comprador capitalists adopt the "self-rescue policy." The Chinese Khrushchev, standing on the bourgeoisie's position, wanted us to obey the foremen's "legitimate commands," teaching the workers not to have "misunderstandings" with the capitalists, and to "unite as one" and "seek happiness together." What "self-rescue policy"! The capitalists' "self-rescue" is even more cruel exploitation of the workers. And this good "idea" was actually proposed by the Chinese Khrushchev, who hung the sign of "labor leader." Isn't this strange! What "obey the foremen's legitimate commands"! What "do not have misunderstandings with the capitalists," and "unite as one" and "seek happiness together"! This vividly depicts the traitorous face of the Chinese Khrushchev! In the eyes of the Chinese Khrushchev, the whip and fist in the hands of the capitalists and foremen are "legitimate commands," and the workers can only obey the "legitimate commands" of the whip and fist, and are not allowed to resist. Workers and capitalists are mortal enemies, irreconcilable hostile classes, and they have a thousand grievances and a million hatreds. However, the Chinese Khrushchev sternly taught the workers not to "hate" the capitalists, not to have "misunderstandings" with the capitalists, but to "unite as one" and "seek happiness together" with the capitalists. The Chinese Khrushchev's so-called "unity as one" with the capitalists is to not allow the workers to resist, not allow the workers to revolt, but to make the workers forever submit to the capitalists' cruel oppression and exploitation, using the workers' blood and sweat to maintain the capitalists' "happiness." This is a thoroughgoing traitor's theory! The Chinese Khrushchev also proposed "worker self-government." Under this reactionary slogan, he wanted the club's cadres and reactionary foremen, mine managers, and supervisors to hold "joint meetings" to study "production rectification" methods; establish a "production management committee" to supervise workers to "produce more coal" and "clean out the coal," and together with the capitalists to think of ways to extort the workers. Look, how black and poisonous the Chinese Khrushchev's heart is! This is no different from the capitalists who drink the workers' blood and skin the workers!

When the comprador capitalists' Hanyang-Pingxiang Company was about to go bankrupt, the Chinese Khrushchev hurriedly threw out the "four agreements" to rescue Hanyang-Pingxiang, forcing the workers to "jointly abide by" and "not violate." During the 1922 strike movement, this "negotiation enthusiast," the Chinese Khrushchev, deleted four of the seventeen demands proposed by the workers, altered five, and sold out the interests of the workers; he also shamelessly said: "The Arbitration Committee" is "to settle disputes and maintain justice." He "settled" the workers' struggle, and maintained the capitalists' "law." The Chinese Khrushchev was like this, peddling the traitorous theory of "exploitation is meritorious, revolution is guilty, and rebellion is unreasonable."

Liu Xusheng (an old railway worker who participated in the Anshun Road and Mine Strike and the Autumn Harvest Uprising):

I will expose the Chinese Khrushchev who is praised in the movie. He is not a "hero with a brave heart," but a "ghostly" fool, a "supreme emperor" riding on our workers' heads, and a great traitor in the workers' movement.

In the past, there was a worker in the Anshun coal mine named Xie Huai'de. This person had a firm stance and clear hatred. We workers all said Xie Huai'de was a good example. However, the Chinese Khrushchev and the capitalists saw Xie Huai'de as a thorn in their side. Once, the stationmaster on the railway wanted to take the good rice that the workers were eating and exchange it for moldy rice, intending to profit from it. Xie Huai'de found out and beat the reactionary stationmaster with an iron rod. Who would have thought that the beating on the reactionary stationmaster's body hurt the Chinese Khrushchev's heart. In order to please the reactionary officials, he then took Xie Huai'de as a target, struggling against him, suspending him, and finally expelling Xie Huai'de from the Anshun coal mine. Selling out the interests of the workers, persecuting revolutionary workers, and pleasing the capitalists, this is the evil deed done by the Chinese Khrushchev in Anshun.

Even more infuriating is: the Chinese Khrushchev clearly knew that the enemy was about to strike at the workers' club, but he still wrote the names of the club's cadres in the commemorative books and reports, allowing the enemy to arrest people by name. On September 20, 1925, the enemy suddenly surrounded the workers' club. When the workers heard that the club was surrounded, they rushed out to rescue it at the risk of their lives. The enemy opened fire, killing two workers on the spot and injuring more than thirty; seventy club cadres, including Huang Jingyuan, were arrested. At that time, Huang Jingyuan comrade said to us: "Revolution is not afraid of death, those who fear death do not revolt!" Encouraging everyone to fight to the end with the enemy. After Huang comrade was arrested, he endured countless tortures, stood tall and unyielding, and died a heroic death. The mastermind of the September Massacre is the Chinese Khrushchev, whose hands are stained with the blood of our workers. Decades have passed, and the Chinese Khrushchev still shamelessly says: "When we led the great strike, there were no losses, and after I left, many comrades were sacrificed." The Chinese Khrushchev not only escaped but also wanted to frame others. How sinister his intentions are! The tree has roots, and the debt has a master. These crimes must be exposed, and these blood debts must be settled. We will not rest until we thoroughly criticize and expose this old traitor, the Chinese Khrushchev.

Zhang Mingdong (platoon leader):

After listening to the old workers' exposure and criticism, I am extremely angry. The Chinese Khrushchev, who was praised by the reactionary film "Spark" as a "hero with a brave heart," is actually a butcher who suppresses the workers' movement and a great traitor who sells out his comrades.

The Chinese Khrushchev has long been an implacable enemy of the proletariat and a loyal servant of the capitalists and landlords. When the Hanyang-Pingxiang Company was on the verge of bankruptcy, he threw out the "four agreements" to rescue Hanyang-Pingxiang, running errands for the bankrupt comprador capitalists, forcing the workers to "jointly abide by" and not allowing the workers to rise up against the capitalists. At the critical moment of the 1922 strike, he colluded with the comprador capitalists, deleting four of the seventeen demands proposed by the workers and altering five, selling out the interests of the working class. In the 1920s, in old China, the three big mountains pressed down on the workers so that they could hardly breathe, but he promoted "legal struggle," abolished armed struggle, actively peddled counter-revolutionary "economism," attempting to extinguish the revolutionary sparks that Chairman Mao ignited in Anshun, and attempting to lead the political revolution, which aimed to overthrow the three big mountains and establish a new China, into the dead end of "legal struggle" and "economism."

The Chinese Khrushchev's consistent actions are a history of counter-revolutionary activities from beginning to end, and every pore of his body exudes a stench.

The objective history is something that a few black pens cannot distort. The unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, like the surging waves of the sea, mercilessly sweeps away all ghosts and monsters, demons and spirits. The great traitor, the Chinese Khrushchev, who has long hung the sign of "labor leader," has been exposed by the revolutionary people. History has sentenced this great schemer to death! The reactionary film "Spark," which builds monuments and biographies for the Chinese Khrushchev, is a historical witness to the Chinese Khrushchev and his clique's conspiracy to usurp the party and the government. Let us hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, thoroughly criticize and expose the reactionary film "Spark," and make it, along with the Chinese Khrushchev, stink for eternity!

    中国赫鲁晓夫是地地道道的大工贼大叛徒
    ——当年参加安源路矿大罢工的老工人和解放军某部指战员批判反动影片《燎原》座谈纪要
    当年参加安源路矿大罢工的老工人和解放军某部指战员，看了反动影片《燎原》后，无比愤慨，异口同声地愤怒声讨中国赫鲁晓夫二十年代在安源犯下的滔天罪行。他们用大量事实证明中国赫鲁晓夫从来就不是什么“工运领袖”，而是不折不扣的大工贼，地地道道的大叛徒。
    反动影片《燎原》是颠倒历史的黑标本
    徐胜远（参加安源路矿大罢工和秋收起义的老工人）：
    《燎原》这部坏电影，我越看越生气。中国赫鲁晓夫明明是个黑乌鸦，影片却硬要把他打扮成“金凤凰”。不管影片炮制者怎么为他涂脂抹粉，也欺骗不了我们忠于毛主席的老工人。
    我记得早在一九二一年秋天，我们敬爱的毛主席就步行来到安源。第二天毛主席就串茅棚，下矿井，到工人中间问寒问暖，和我们谈心交朋友。还给我们宣传革命道理，教育工友要抱成一个团，拧成一股绳，一个心眼跟资本家斗。毛主席的话句句刻在我们心坎上，毛泽东思想的光辉照得我们工人心里亮堂堂。我们工人还编了歌谣热情歌颂毛主席：
    直到一九二一年，忽然雾散见晴天。
    有个能人毛润之，打从湖南来安源。
    他和工人把话谈，解除苦难不为难。
    提议要给办工会，劳动工界结成团。
    我们安源工人根据毛主席的教导，很快组织起来，办夜校，立工会，发展党员，建立党支部。一九二二年，毛主席又来到安源亲自组织大罢工，我们按照毛主席的指示，在九月十四日举行了大罢工。经过五天五夜的斗争，取得了胜利。这次大罢工的决策是毛主席下的，部署是毛主席订的，口号是毛主席提的，大罢工的胜利是伟大的毛泽东思想的胜利。可是反动影片《燎原》却只字不提毛主席，把毛主席的丰功伟绩抹煞得一干二净。电影里“一九二一年”几个字一闪就冒出了个雷焕觉。这个中国赫鲁晓夫的化身，一到安源就挂牌子办夜校，好象是积极为咱们工人办事，其实这完全是胡编瞎造。中国赫鲁晓夫是在我们罢工一切都准备停当了的前两天才来到安源，来了之后就推行一条“一反二压三叛卖”的机会主义路线。这次震惊中外的大罢工胜利的功劳怎么也算不到他身上呀！中国赫鲁晓夫指使他的黑爪牙夏衍之流恶毒地篡改历史，往自己脸上贴金，真是无耻之至，反动透顶！
    彭友钦（参加安源大罢工和秋收起义的老工人）：
    老徐讲的都是事实。大罢工胜利后，毛主席一直关怀着安源工人的斗争。我们紧紧跟着毛主席，有的参加了毛主席领导的秋收起义，有的跟着毛主席上了井冈山，在毛泽东思想的指引下，我们从胜利走向胜利。反动电影《燎原》却颠倒黑白，把毛主席的伟大功绩记到中国赫鲁晓夫身上。拍电影时，我们曾提过质问：为什么不提毛主席？他们说我们“不懂艺术”。原来他们的“艺术”就是篡改历史，为中国赫鲁晓夫脸上涂脂抹粉。四十多年前，中国赫鲁晓夫在安源的所做所为，我们老工人心里一清二楚。当时，我们老工人给他做过这样一个鉴定：“作事精神不好，过于审慎，平时对工友的交际和谈说，都表现一种不愿意的懒散态度。做事也不大加整理。到后来对俱乐部事务不十分负责……这都是他的过错。”中国赫鲁晓夫这个家伙高高在上，从来不接触工人，反而和资本家打得火热。我们工人早就对他恨之入骨。
    宋其顺（学习毛主席著作积极分子、班长）：
    老工人是安源斗争历史的最好见证人。铁的事实证明：安源革命的火种是毛主席亲手撒；安源大罢工的决策是毛主席亲手定；安源工人斗争的胜利开的是毛泽东思想之花。可是反动影片《燎原》却从头至尾看不见毛主席对安源路矿工人运动的一个指示，听不到毛主席的一句话，就连毛主席的名字也看不到。伟大的导师毛主席教导我们：混进党里、政府里、军队里和各种文化界的资产阶级代表人物，是一批反革命的修正主义分子，一旦时机成熟，他们就会要夺取政权，由无产阶级专政变为资产阶级专政。反革命修正主义分子夏衍等人秉承其黑主子中国赫鲁晓夫的黑指示，明目张胆地篡改历史，就是为了给中国赫鲁晓夫复辟资本主义大造舆论。中国赫鲁晓夫打着“多写矿史以教育青年”的幌子，授意他的爪牙大写特写安源“革命斗争史”、“回忆录”、戏剧、小说、电影、歌谣等，为他歌颂功德。他多次指示要在安源修建他的所谓“历史文物”、“纪念碑”、“纪念馆”，妄图把安源俱乐部修建成他的“家庙”，为他建树“功德碑”。他还唆使他的小娄罗在北京大做歪曲历史的黑报告，挖空心思为自己捞取政治资本。一九六二年，正当国内外阶级敌人蠢蠢欲动，牛鬼蛇神纷纷出笼的时候，反动影片《燎原》和大毒草《修养》同时出笼，这决不是历史的偶合，这是中国赫鲁晓夫蓄谋已久的篡党、篡军、篡政野心的大暴露。
    中国赫鲁晓夫是买办资本家的乏走狗
    谭福生（安源大罢工老工人、红军老战士）：
    大毒草《燎原》把中国赫鲁晓夫的化身雷焕觉吹捧成领导工人运动的“领袖”，和资本家英勇斗争的
  “英雄”。这是影片炮制者吹的大牛皮。其实中国赫鲁晓夫是出卖工人利益的大工贼，资本家门下的乏走狗。他来到安源不领导工人搞政治斗争，整天洋腔怪调地鼓吹“经济主义”，想用几张“滥矿票”蒙住我们的眼睛，让工人跪倒在资本家面前乞求几个臭铜钱，妄想用小恩小惠来收买工人阶级的心。我们根本不听他那一套！
    我们安源工人在毛主席的领导下，政治斗争的革命烈火越烧越旺。中国赫鲁晓夫吓破了胆，胡说什么搞政治斗争、夺取政权是“很远的事实”，“增加工资，减少时间这种经济斗争”才是“唯一的切要企图”。这个家伙打出：“我们要活命，我们要吃饭！”这面反革命经济主义的破旗，千方百计限制我们的革命行动。他还鹦鹉学舌地下令叫我们复工说：“罢工几天了，你们进班要多出炭，资本家亏了本，你们稀饭也吃不上。”这个中国赫鲁晓夫就是这样给资本家打气吹喇叭，给我们工人头上泼冷水，明目张胆地鼓吹“剥削有功”、“资本家养活工人”的剥削阶级理论。他生怕我们进行政治斗争触动了资本家的天堂，一再表白罢工是“为了吃饭”，“为了活命”，“与政治军事问题不发生关系”。
    中国赫鲁晓夫搞的那一套“经济主义”是麻醉人民的鸦片，毒害工人的砒霜，是扼杀工人运动的软刀子。由于中国赫鲁晓夫推行机会主义路线的结果，一九二五年九月间，当买办资本家勾结军阀向我们下毒手的时候，工人俱乐部却毫无应变准备，结果俱乐部遭到严重破坏，许多干部和工人被捕和杀害；几千名工人被开除，在中国赫鲁晓夫反革命经济主义这把软刀子下面，多少工人葬送了性命，多少工人遭到迫害。现在想起来还使人痛心，这笔血债我们一定要清算！
    李有德（参加安源大罢工的铁路老工人、红军老战士）：
    中国赫鲁晓夫这个老机会主义者来到安源一头就投到资本家的怀抱里，充当买办资本家的忠实走狗。在汉冶萍公司面临破产时，资本家威胁工人说：汉冶萍破产，工人就要饿死。中国赫鲁晓夫也跳出来帮腔：“汉冶萍之存在与否，实为百余万人民之生计所关”。资本家逼我们工人多出煤“救护”他们的汉冶萍公司，中国赫鲁晓夫马上跟着大喊大叫：“中国国民呵！……中国最大基础的实业汉冶萍，要停工破产了呵！其速起救护吧！”主唱仆和，多么合拍！中国赫鲁晓夫为资本家维护产业的这种“积极性”，得到了资本家的赏识。资本家亲热地要求与俱乐部一同“开创劳资兄弟亲密合作的新时代”。你看，中国赫鲁晓夫与资本家感情多么深厚，合作得多么默契啊！直到解放后，反动资本家、原安源矿长舒修泰还写信给中国赫鲁晓夫，感谢他过去的“排难解纷”。看，买办资本家与头号大工贼之间的交情多深啊！
    中国赫鲁晓夫爱的是买办资本家，恨的是工人阶级，干的是资本家的活，喝的是工人的血。他是个不折不扣的大工贼。
    张德田（学习毛主席著作积极分子、战士）：
    反动影片《燎原》疯狂鼓吹中国赫鲁晓夫“劳资合作”的修正主义黑货，抹杀阶级和阶级斗争。他在安源大罢工时曾说：“我和资本家没有仇。”一句话暴露了秘密。中国赫鲁晓夫和资本家岂止是没有“仇”，简直亲得很哩！二十年代的中国赫鲁晓夫是“工运领袖”，还是大工贼，他自己不早就作出结论了吗！
    工人和资本家，农民和地主是两个敌对的阶级，他们之间的关系是你死我活的阶级斗争关系。有地主、资本家的天下，就没有工人、农民的活路。中国赫鲁晓夫却硬要工人和资本家“合作”，这不是叫我们向敌人投降又是什么？我们工人、农民和资本家、地主有血海深仇，资本家、地主的天堂是建筑在我们工人、农民的白骨堆上的。地主、资本家的发家史，就是我们工人、农民的血泪史。“少年进炭棚，老年背竹筒，病了赶你走，死了不如狗。”这就是安源煤矿工人在旧社会深受资本家压迫剥削的真实写照。我们工人、农民与地主、资本家有千仇万恨。我们牢记阶级苦，不忘血泪仇，今天我们工人、农民翻身做了主人，就是要专资产阶级、地主阶级的政。让资本家、地主的孝子贤孙中国赫鲁晓夫见鬼去吧！
    中国赫鲁晓夫是出卖工人利益的大叛徒
    谭福生：
    中国赫鲁晓夫是一个地地道道的买办资本家的
  “高级谋士”。一九二四年他抛出一株《整顿萍矿意见书》的大毒草，建议买办资本家采用“自救政策”。中国赫鲁晓夫站在资产阶级的立场上，要我们服从工头的“正当指挥”，教训我们工人和资本家不要闹“隔阂”，应该“团结一致”、“共谋幸福”。什么“自救政策”！资本家的“自救”就是对工人更加残酷的剥削。而这个好“主意”竟是挂着“工运领袖”招牌的中国赫鲁晓夫出的，岂非咄咄怪事！什么服从工头的“正当指挥”！什么不要与资本家闹“隔阂”，要“团结一致”、
  “共谋幸福”！这活脱脱地勾划出了中国赫鲁晓夫的叛徒嘴脸！在中国赫鲁晓夫眼里，资本家、工头手中的皮鞭就是“正当指挥”，工人只能服从皮鞭、拳头的“正当指挥”，不准有任何反抗。工人和资本家是死对头，是势不两立的敌对阶级，他们之间有着千仇万恨。而中国赫鲁晓夫却板着脸孔教训工人不要“仇恨”资本家，不要与资本家有“隔阂”，而要和资本家“团结一致”、“共谋幸福”。中国赫鲁晓夫所谓的与资本家
  “团结一致”，就是不准工人反抗，不准工人革命，而要工人永远屈从于资本家的残酷压迫和剥削，用工人的血汗去维持资本家的“幸福”。这是道道地地的叛徒理论！中国赫鲁晓夫还提出什么“工人自治”。就在这个“工人自治”的反动口号下，他要俱乐部的干部和反动工头、矿长、总管一起开“联席会议”，研究“整顿生产”的办法；成立“生产管理委员会”，督促工人“多出煤”、“把煤出净”，与资本家一起想方设法敲诈工人。你看，中国赫鲁晓夫的黑心多狠，多毒！这同喝工人的血、剥工人的皮的资本家有什么两样！
    买办资本家开办的汉冶萍公司快要破产时，中国赫鲁晓夫又急急忙忙抛出救护汉冶萍“四条协定”，强迫工人“共同遵守”、“不得违犯”。一九二二年罢工运动中，中国赫鲁晓夫这个“谈判迷”把工人提出的十七条要求，删掉四条，篡改五条，出卖了我们工人利益；他还厚颜无耻地说：“裁判委员会”是“本息事宁人之旨，持正直公平之法。”他“息”的是工人斗争的烈火，持的是资本家的“法”。中国赫鲁晓夫就是这样贩卖剥削有功、革命有罪、造反无理的叛徒理论。
    柳煦生（参加安源路矿大罢工和秋收起义的铁路老工人）：
    我再揭揭电影里吹嘘的那个中国的赫鲁晓夫。他那是什么“一身是胆”的英雄，而是个“浑身是鬼”的草包，是骑在我们工人头上的“太上皇”，是工人运动中的大叛徒。
    当年安源煤矿有个工人叫谢怀德，这个人立场坚定，爱憎分明。我们工人都说谢怀德是好样的。可中国赫鲁晓夫和资本家却把谢怀德视为眼中钉。有一次，铁路上的站长又要把我们工人吃的好米拉去换霉米，企图从中取利。谢怀德知道了，用铁棍把反动站长狠狠揍了一顿。谁知揍在反动站长身上，却疼在中国赫鲁晓夫心上。他为了讨好反动官僚，于是就拿谢怀德开刀，又是斗争，又是吊打体罚，最后，把谢怀德同志赶出了安源煤矿。出卖工人利益，迫害革命工人，讨资本家的欢心，这就是中国赫鲁晓夫在安源干的罪恶勾当。
    更令人气愤的是：中国赫鲁晓夫明明知道敌人要向工人俱乐部下毒手，却还把工人俱乐部的干部名单写在纪念册、报告册上，使敌人能够按名抓人。一九二五年九月二十日，敌人突然包围了工人俱乐部。工人一听俱乐部被包围，拚死出来抢救。敌人开了枪，当场打死了两个工人，打伤三十多人；俱乐部干部黄静源等七十人被捕。当时黄静源同志对我们说：“革命不怕死，怕死不革命！”鼓舞大家和敌人斗争到底。黄同志被捕后，受尽了酷刑，大义凛然，至死不屈，壮烈牺牲了。九月惨案的罪魁祸首是中国赫鲁晓夫，他双手沾满我们工人的鲜血。几十年过去了，中国赫鲁晓夫还大言不惭地说：“我们领导大罢工时，没有什么损失，我走了以后牺牲了许多同志。”中国赫鲁晓夫逃跑还不算，还想嫁祸于人，其用心何其毒也！树有根，债有主，这一桩桩罪行都要诉，一笔笔血债都要算，不把中国赫鲁晓夫这个老叛徒批倒批臭，我们死不瞑目。
    张明东（排长）：
    听了老工人的揭发批判，我非常气愤。被反动影片《燎原》吹捧成“一身是胆”的“英雄”的中国赫鲁晓夫，原来是镇压工人运动的刽子手，出卖同志的大叛徒。
    中国赫鲁晓夫早就是无产阶级不共戴天的死敌，是资本家、地主的忠实奴才。在汉冶萍公司面临破产时，他抛出救护汉冶萍“四条协定”，为破产的买办资本家奔走效劳，硬要工人“共同遵守”，不准工人起来造资本家的反。在一九二二年大罢工的关键时刻，他和买办资本家串通一气，把工人提出的十七条要求，删掉四条篡改五条，把工人阶级利益拿来拍卖。在二十年代的旧中国，三座大山压得工人连气都喘不过来，他却鼓吹“合法斗争”，取消武装斗争，积极贩卖反革命“经济主义”，妄想把毛主席在安源撒下的革命火种扑灭，妄想把旨在推翻三座大山、建立新中国的政治革命引到“合法斗争”和“经济主义”的死胡同。
    中国赫鲁晓夫的一贯行径，就是一部从头到尾的反革命活动史，他的每个毛孔都散发着臭气。

    客观的历史是几支黑笔杆篡改不了的。史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命象大海的怒涛，无情地冲击着一切牛鬼蛇神、魑魅魍魉。一直挂着“工运领袖”招牌的大叛徒中国赫鲁晓夫，被革命人民揪了出来。历史宣判了这个大野心家的死刑！为中国赫鲁晓夫树碑立传的反动影片《燎原》，就是中国赫鲁晓夫及其一伙阴谋篡党、篡政的历史见证。让我们高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，把反动影片《燎原》批倒批臭，批得它和中国的赫鲁晓夫一样遗臭万年！
