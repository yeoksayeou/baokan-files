The Albanian "People's Voice" newspaper published an editorial on April 9, enthusiastically hailing the new wave of struggle by American blacks against the American ruling class. The editorial pointed out that only through revolutionary struggle can American blacks win their rights.

The article said, Johnson's order to massacre and persecute black demonstrators has made blacks, who are suffering from inhuman oppression and exploitation, more convinced that they must use revolutionary violence to counter the reactionary and fascist violence of the capitalist state machine. The path of class "harmony" and "compromise" advocated by pacifists and modern revisionists is a path of servitude to the bourgeoisie, leading to capitulation and surrender.

The article emphasized that currently, American blacks are under the double oppression of capitalist exploitation and racial discrimination. This cruel reality is increasingly making blacks aware that to eliminate racial slavery, they must fight to eliminate the capitalist exploitation and social economic system that produces racial discrimination, and must overthrow the representatives of this system.

The article said, the more intense the struggle of American blacks and the more savage the police brutality in suppressing this just struggle, the more it demonstrates the sharpening of class contradictions within the United States. Currently, the characteristics of the black struggle are its large scale, broad and deep reach, and this struggle is also linked with the struggle of the American working class and various strata of people against Johnson's anti-people policies at home and against U.S. aggression in Vietnam. The black struggle has won the sympathy and support of all freedom-loving and progressive people and all anti-imperialist forces in the world.

The article pointed out that the extensive scale of the American black struggle indicates the serious instability of the rule of the American monopoly capitalists. The Vietnam War, which is consuming huge amounts of dollars, is an important factor in the serious financial crisis and the shaky position of the dollar. Therefore, the Vietnam War, the dollar crisis, and the black struggle are three tightly interlinked chains around the neck of U.S. imperialism.

The article concluded by saying that the flames of the American black struggle cannot be extinguished. No matter what means the U.S. imperialist leaders use, they cannot stop the inevitable deepening of the general crisis of the capitalist system.

    阿《人民之声报》热烈欢呼美国黑人奋起武装抗暴
    推翻资本主义制度才能消灭种族奴役
    据新华社地拉那九日电　阿尔巴尼亚《人民之声报》九日发表编辑部文章，热烈欢呼美国黑人反对美国统治阶级的新的斗争浪潮，并且指出，只有通过革命斗争，美国黑人才能赢得自己的权利。
    文章说，约翰逊下令对黑人示威者进行屠杀和迫害，使受着惨无人道的压迫和剥削的美国黑人更加相信，必须用革命的暴力来对付资本主义国家机器的反动的和法西斯的暴力。和平主义者和现代修正主义者所鼓吹的阶级“调和”和“折衷”的道路，是为资产阶级效劳的，是导致屈膝和投降的。
    文章强调说，目前压在美国黑人头上的是资本主义剥削和种族歧视的双重压迫。这一残酷现实日益使黑人相信，为了消灭种族奴役，必须为消灭产生种族歧视的资本主义剥削制度和社会经济制度而斗争，必须推翻这一制度的代表者。
    文章说，美国黑人斗争的更加高涨和军警扑灭这一正义斗争的野蛮暴行，再一次有力地表明美国国内阶级矛盾的尖锐化。目前黑人斗争的特点是人数众多，又广又深，这一斗争并且同美国工人阶级和各阶层人民反对约翰逊政府对内的反人民政策、反对美帝侵略越南的斗争联系起来了。黑人的斗争，得到世界上一切爱好自由和进步人民及一切反帝力量的同情和支持。
    文章强调指出，美国黑人斗争的广泛规模，说明美国垄断集团的统治严重不稳。越来越多地消耗巨额美元的侵越战争，是美国财政危机和美元地位严重动摇的重要因素之一。因此，侵越战争、美元危机和黑人的斗争，是套在美帝脖子上的三根紧密相连的锁链。
    文章最后说，美国黑人的斗争烽火是无法扑灭的。不管美帝头子使用什么手段，都不能制止资本主义制度总危机进一步加深的不可避免的过程。
