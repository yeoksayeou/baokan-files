    Chairman Mao waves his hand, I advance
    — The Jinan Military Region actively learns and applies Mao Zedong Thought, achieving new merits in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution

    "In the future, cadres should go down to the grassroots, walk around, and see for themselves. They should adhere to the mass line, consult with the masses on everything, and be students of the masses." Following Chairman Mao's great teachings, the commander of a certain regiment in the Jinan Military Region, Comrade Tan Yanzhen, insisted on participating in labor, humbly learning from the soldiers, and studying Mao Zedong Thought with the masses. This is Tan Yanzhen studying with the soldiers on how to emphasize proletarian politics, improve preparedness work, defend the dictatorship of the proletariat, and defend the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

    Politics is the commander, the soul. Political work is the lifeline of all economic work. In the war years, a certain regiment of the Jinan Military Region, which won battle merits, firmly built the army with Mao Zedong Thought and walked the path of political construction of the army. In the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, they bravely defended Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line and supported the broad masses of the left. In a battle to rescue a burning train, the soldiers braved fire and water, safeguarded state property and the safety of people's lives, ensured smooth railway transportation, and achieved new merits for the people. This is the regiment's soldiers and revolutionary workers repairing a locomotive together.

    "The People's Liberation Army should support the broad masses of the left." Comrade Sun Leyi, the logistics chief of a certain regiment in the Jinan Military Region, on the front line of "three-in-one" and "two-in-one," often uses the two rulers of "completely" and "thoroughly" and the two mirrors of "extremes" to examine himself. He is infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao's great teachings, often propagandizing and arming the masses with Mao Zedong Thought. This is Comrade Sun Leyi discussing with revolutionary workers how to further implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions.

    "You must put politics in command, go to the masses, be with the masses, and make the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution better." The study group of a certain regiment in the Jinan Military Region, which actively learns and applies Mao Zedong Thought, always maintains close ties with the masses, leading the broad masses of soldiers and officers to achieve new merits in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. This is the study group members and officers and soldiers studying Chairman Mao's latest instructions seriously.

    "Our army is completely for the liberation of the people and works thoroughly for the people's interests." Comrade Yuan Guitian, the deputy political instructor of the West Dagu Militia Company in Tianzhuang Commune, Ningjin County, Shandong Province, has insisted on actively learning and applying Mao Zedong Thought for years, consciously transforming his worldview. In the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, he lost his right arm while rescuing Red Guards, showing the spirit of selflessness and communism. This is Comrade Yuan Guitian enthusiastically propagating Mao Zedong Thought in the fields.

    "Regarding the theory of Marxism, one must be able to master it and apply it; the purpose of mastering it is entirely for application." Comrade Li Xiulin, a family member of a certain regiment in the Jinan Military Region, with deep class feelings for Chairman Mao, overcame the difficulty of illiteracy, and diligently studied Mao Zedong Thought, especially the "Three Articles" and Chairman Mao's theories on the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. She not only used Mao Zedong Thought to transform her own thoughts but also paid great attention to educating her children, making them love Chairman Mao from a young age and establish a worldview of selflessness. This is their family holding a struggle session to criticize and study revisionism.

    "Thousands and tens of thousands of martyrs have sacrificed their lives for the people's interests in front of us. Let us hold high their banner and march forward in their blood!" The comrades from the class where Wang Jie served as a model, following the old class leader Wang Jie's example, "Do as Chairman Mao says," are loyal to Chairman Mao with all their hearts and keep advancing on the road of thought revolutionization. This is Deputy Class Leader Xu Ruming sharing their experiences of actively learning and applying Mao Zedong Thought with brother units.

    毛主席挥手我前进
    ——济南部队活学活用毛泽东思想，在无产阶级文化大革命运动中立新功
  “以后干部要分别到下面去走一走，看一看，要坚持群众路线，遇事多和群众商量，做群众的小学生。”济南部队某部团长谭延勤同志遵照毛主席的伟大教导，坚持参加劳动，虚心向战士学习，和群众一起活学活用毛泽东思想。这是谭延勤正在和战士们一起研究如何突出无产阶级政治，把战备工作搞得更好，保卫无产阶级专政，保卫无产阶级文化大革命。
    政治是统帅，是灵魂。政治工作是一切经济工作的生命线。在战争年代荣立战功的济南部队某部一营，坚决靠毛泽东思想建设部队，走政治建军的道路。在无产阶级文化大革命中，他们勇敢地捍卫毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，支持左派广大群众。在一次抢救列车失火的战斗中，指战员们赴汤蹈火，保卫了国家财产和人民生命的安全，保证了铁路运输畅通，为人民立下新功。这是一营的指战员们和革命职工一起检修机车。
    “人民解放军应该支持左派广大群众”。济南部队某团后勤处长孙乐义同志，在“三支”“两军”第一线，经常用“完全”“彻底”这两把尺子和两个“极端”这两面镜子，对照检查自己。他无限忠于毛主席的伟大教导，经常用毛泽东思想宣传群众，武装群众。这是孙乐义同志和革命职工一起讨论进一步落实毛主席的最新指示。
    “你们要政治挂帅，到群众里面去，和群众在一起，把无产阶级文化大革命搞得更好。”济南部队某部活学活用毛泽东思想中心组，时时处处密切联系群众，带领广大指战员在无产阶级文化大革命中，为人民立了新功。这是活学活用毛泽东思想中心组的成员和干部、战士一起认真学习毛主席的最新指示。
    “我们这个队伍完全是为着解放人民的，是彻底地为人民的利益工作的。”山东省宁津县田庄公社西大苑民兵连副指导员苑桂田同志，几年来一直坚持活学活用毛泽东思想，自觉改造世界观。在无产阶级文化大革命中，为抢救红卫兵小将而失去了右臂，表现出舍己为人的共产主义精神。这是苑桂田同志在田头热情宣传毛泽东思想。

    “对于马克思主义的理论，要能够精通它、应用它，精通的目的全在于应用。”济南部队某部随军家属李秀林同志，怀着对毛主席的深厚的阶级感情，克服不识字的困难，刻苦地学习毛泽东思想，大学大用“老三篇”和毛主席关于无产阶级文化大革命的理论。她不但用毛泽东思想改造自己的思想，而且非常重视教育子女，使子女从小就无限热爱毛主席，树立一心为公的世界观。这是他们全家在开斗私批修讲用会。
    “成千成万的先烈，为着人民的利益，在我们的前头英勇地牺牲了，让我们高举起他们的旗帜，踏着他们的血迹前进吧！”王杰生前所在班的同志们，以老班长王杰为榜样，“毛主席怎么说，我就怎么做”，对毛主席赤胆忠心，在思想革命化的道路上不断前进。这是副班长徐汝明同志在向兄弟部队介绍他们活学活用毛泽东思想的体会。
