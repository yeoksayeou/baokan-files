The reactionary film *Red River Waves* was produced during the black wind of rehabilitation in 1962. What kind of "wind" was it, and what kind of "waves" did it stir up?

From the film, we know that it depicts the activities of the guerrilla forces in the Shaan-Gan-Ning Border Region, which was under the control of the anti-party element Gao Gang from 1932 to 1935. The entire film passionately praises Zhang Tiewa, who is portrayed as Gao Gang's alter ego. Zhang is glorified as the "leader" who "organized armed struggle," the "peasant leader," the "savior of the people" who "struggled against landlords and distributed land," and the "representative" of the correct revolutionary line in China. It seems that he "invented" guerrilla tactics in a situation of "few people and few guns"; that he could "withstand the test" and be "unyielding" in the face of defeat; that he led the guerrilla forces to "establish a foothold" on the Shaan-Gan Plateau and developed them into the "main force of the Red Army," clearing the way for the "Central Red Army"; that he "opened up base areas" in the vast rural areas of Shaanbei. The film relentlessly propagates the idea that before Chairman Mao and the Central Red Army arrived in Shaanbei in 1935, Gao Gang had already become the "pioneer" of rural revolutionary base areas and the "founder" of the Chinese Workers' and Peasants' Red Army. Its central theme is the reactionary fallacy that "without Shaan-Gan, there would be no New China." Through the character of Yang the Carpenter shouting to Gao Gang's alter ego, "We poor people can't do without you!" the film attempts to designate Nanliang as the birthplace of the Chinese revolution and to deify Gao Gang as the "savior" of the Chinese revolution.

However, history is not a piece of marble that can be carved at will. "Falsehood is falsehood, and disguise should be stripped away." The ironclad fact is that as early as forty years ago, our great teacher Chairman Mao had already established, through practice, the brilliant ideas of building the Chinese Workers' and Peasants' Red Army, opening up rural revolutionary base areas, and surrounding the cities from the countryside. The Autumn Harvest Uprising ignited the torch of armed struggle, giving birth to the armed forces of the workers and peasants. Subsequently, the march to Jinggangshan created China's first red base area. In January 1935, the historic Zunyi Conference established Chairman Mao's leadership over the entire Party and the entire army, and since then, the Chinese revolution has advanced victoriously along the path indicated by Chairman Mao.

In October 1935, after Chairman Mao led the Central Red Army to Shaanbei, he immediately saved the crisis in Shaanbei. Under Chairman Mao's brilliant leadership, Shaanbei became the holy land of the Chinese revolution. History has already made its judgment: only Chairman Mao is the creator of the people's army and New China, the savior of the Chinese people; only Chairman Mao is the great teacher, great leader, great commander, and great helmsman of the Chinese revolution. However, the creators of the film maliciously distorted history, confusing right and wrong. Their evil intentions are not obvious?

The film was produced around 1962 under the plot of anti-party conspirators. At that time, it was precisely when the anti-party conspirators, headed by the Chinese Khrushchev, were stirring up a black wind of rehabilitation. The Chinese Khrushchev himself "led the charge," bare-chested, openly rehabilitating the great schemer and anti-party element Peng Dehuai, and viciously shouting, "The Lushan Conference made a mistake." With the master taking the lead, the followers were even more eager, and a black wind of rehabilitation blew fiercely. Under such circumstances, the reactionary film *Red River Waves* emerged. It is clear that the reactionary film *Red River Waves* is a small, turbulent wave stirred up in the black wind of rehabilitation orchestrated by the Chinese Khrushchev, aiming to rehabilitate the anti-party element Gao Gang and to make a ferocious counterattack against the proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao. It is entirely a piece of counter-revolutionary propaganda manufactured by the Chinese Khrushchev to usurp the Party, the army, and the government, and to restore capitalism.

"Navigating the seas relies on the helmsman, and making revolution relies on Mao Zedong Thought." With the great helmsman Chairman Mao steering us, and with the invincible Mao Zedong Thought guiding our way forward, we can overcome all storms and waves. A few loaches trying to stir up a few waves to obstruct the revolutionary ship's advance is a pipe dream! They and their master, the Chinese Khrushchev and his ilk, will surely be smashed to pieces by the revolutionary giant ship surging forward!

    刮的什么“风”　激的什么“浪”
    津战兵
    在一九六二年的翻案黑风中，反动影片《红河激浪》炮制出笼了。这究竟是刮来的什么“风”，激起的什么“浪”呢？
    从影片中我们知道，它所描写的是一九三二年——一九三五年间，被反党分子高岗窃踞领导地位的陕甘南梁地区的游击队活动。整个影片所狂热吹捧的张铁娃就是高岗的化身，他被美化成“领头”“搞武装”的“农民领袖”，“打土豪分田地”的“人民救星”，中国革命正确路线的“代表者”。好象是他在“人少枪少”的情况下，“发明”了游击战术；是他在战斗失利时能“经受住考验”，“百折不回”；是他带领游击队在陕甘高原“站稳了脚跟”，并发展壮大成“主力红军”，为“中央红军扫清前进道路”；是他在陕北广大农村“开辟了根据地”。影片所拚命宣扬的，就是在一九三五年毛主席和中央红军到达陕北之前，高岗早已成了农村革命根据地的“开辟者”，中国工农红军的“创始人”了。它所表现的中心思想，就是“没有陕甘就没有新中国”的反动谬论。影片通过杨木匠向高岗的化身叫喊道：“咱穷人可不能没有你啊！”妄想把南梁封为中国革命的发源地，把高岗封为中国革命的“救世主”。
    但是，历史不是一块可以任意雕刻的大理石。“假的就是假的，伪装应当剥去。”铁的事实是，早在四十年前，我们伟大的导师毛主席就已从实践中创立了关于建立中国工农红军，开辟农村革命根据地，以农村包围城市的光辉思想。秋收起义点起了武装斗争的火炬，产生了工农自己的武装。接着，又进军井冈山，创建了中国第一块红色根据地。一九三五年一月，具有伟大历史意义的遵义会议确立了毛主席在全党、全军的领导地位，从此中国革命一直沿着毛主席指引的道路，胜利前进。
    一九三五年十月，毛主席领导中央红军到达陕北后，立即挽救了陕北的危机。在毛主席的英明领导下，陕北变成了中国革命的圣地。历史早已作出结论：只有毛主席，才是人民军队和新中国的缔造者，才是中国人民的救星；只有毛主席，才是中国革命的伟大导师、伟大领袖、伟大统帅、伟大舵手。但是，影片的炮制者却恶毒地颠倒历史，混淆黑白，其险恶用心，不是昭然若揭了吗？
    影片是一九六二年前后，在反党阴谋家们的策划下炮制出笼的。当时，正是中国赫鲁晓夫及其娄罗们大刮翻案风的时候。中国的赫鲁晓夫“身先士卒”，赤膊上阵，公开为大野心家、大阴谋家、反党分子彭德怀翻案，他恶狠狠地叫嚷：“庐山会议犯了一个错误。”主子一马当先，娄罗更是争先恐后，一时刮起了一股翻案黑风。在这种情况下，反动影片《红河激浪》出笼了，很明显，反动影片《红河激浪》就是在中国赫鲁晓夫刮起的一股翻案黑风中，所激起的一小股为反党分子高岗翻案，向以毛主席为首的无产阶级司令部猖狂反扑的浊流恶浪，它完全是为中国赫鲁晓夫篡党、篡军、篡政，复辟资本主义制造反革命舆论的。
      “大海航行靠舵手，干革命靠毛泽东思想。”有伟大舵手毛主席给我们掌舵，有战无不胜的毛泽东思想照耀着我们前进，我们就能战胜一切险风恶浪。几条泥鳅竟想翻起几个浪花来阻止革命航船的前进，那是白日做梦！他们和他们的主子中国赫鲁晓夫之流，必将被破浪前进的革命巨轮碰得粉身碎骨！
