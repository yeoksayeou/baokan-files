To the Editor:

We, with boundless loyalty to Chairman Mao, came to the Guangzhou Railway Bureau Hengyang Locomotive Section to undertake the glorious task of supporting the Left. Over the course of half a year, we fought alongside and lived with the broad masses of revolutionary proletarians in the section. We witnessed firsthand how railroad workers armed with Mao Zedong Thought braved the storms of class struggle and, with actual deeds, implemented Chairman Mao's great policy of "grasp revolution, promote production."

In a previous period, class enemies, using anarchist reactionaries, attempted to disrupt the normal operation of railway transportation. At this critical moment, the broad masses of revolutionary proletarians in the Hengyang Locomotive Section, under Chairman Mao's call to "grasp revolution, promote production," spontaneously formed the "Revolution and Production Crew Combat Group." They resolutely resisted the anarchist trend. Members of this group declared: under any circumstances, they would not allow trains to stop or be delayed in the Hengyang area; they would increase freight transportation and ensure the smooth operation of passenger trains. Many comrades displayed a spirit of bravery, fearlessness of sacrifice, endurance, and continuous combat. Wherever there were difficulties, they went. They also helped each other, promoted each other, and raised each other's standards, making the entire section a hotbed of revolution and production.

The pioneering actions of the broad masses of revolutionary proletarians in the Hengyang Locomotive Section greatly inspired and educated us. Below are a few episodes from their daily work.

	Supporting the Left personnel from a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army stationed in the Hengyang Locomotive Section

	The driver takes over for the fireman

The rising sun bathed the Hengyang Station in a red glow. After finishing his shift, veteran driver Deng Dafuang did not go home or eat. He walked straight to the passenger station, facing the morning sun.

He always went to the station after each shift to see if there was anything he could do. This had become his habit. He often said, "We are Chairman Mao's red railroad workers, driving locomotives, and we must truly play the role of a locomotive."

As he walked, he encountered driver Zhang Xuexiang running towards him. Zhang stopped him and asked, "Old Zhang, where are you going?"

Old Zhang replied, "The ×× express is about to depart, and the fireman has an emergency and cannot go. I'm going to find a replacement!"

"Don't bother, I'll take over!" Old Deng looked at his watch; there were only a few minutes left until departure. He decisively said, "Let's go, we must not let the train be delayed!"

Old Zhang said, "No, you just finished your shift, and you have back pain. You can't handle consecutive shifts." Old Deng patted his chest and replied loudly, "'What is work? Work is struggle.' Chairman Mao teaches us this, and we must resolutely do it."

"No! You absolutely cannot go! Besides, drivers taking over for firemen is not a rule!" Old Zhang insisted on his opinion, not allowing Old Deng to take over. Unexpectedly, these words infuriated this old worker who had been a beast of burden in the old society for over a decade. He excitedly retorted to Old Zhang, "What do you mean drivers can't take over for firemen? That's the rule of the Chinese Khrushchev! We are Chairman Mao's red railroad workers. Chairman Mao's great call to 'grasp revolution, promote production' is the rule for our proletarian class!"

Old Deng's words warmed Old Zhang's heart.

The departure signal had been given. Old Deng picked up a shovel and skillfully threw shovelfuls of coal into the furnace. The train whistled loudly and departed from Hengyang on time. It was bathed in golden sunlight, speeding along the banks of the Xiang River.

	The train must not stop

One night, the ×× ordinary passenger train arrived at a certain station, and the water level in the water tank had dropped significantly, making it difficult to add water to the boiler. This station also lacked water supply equipment, and the train was about to stop. The dispatch duty officer, considering their actual difficulties, ordered them over the phone to uncouple the carriages and return to Hengyang with a single locomotive to add water.

At this moment, driver Liu Youzhi's thoughts were in turmoil. He thought of the hundreds of passengers on the train, including Red Guards responding to the great leader Chairman Mao's call to return to school and make revolution; soldiers of the People's Liberation Army executing the "three supports, two militaries" tasks; workers and peasants rushing to various battlefronts. If the train stopped, it would directly affect the implementation of Chairman Mao's latest instructions. Moreover, issues like passengers' meals and water would arise. He must find a way to get the train moving.

When encountering problems, Liu Youzhi and the assistant driver and firemen first turned to Chairman Mao's works for guidance. They jointly studied Chairman Mao's instructions on "grasp revolution, promote production" and the brilliant essay "In Memory of Norman Bethune." Chairman Mao's works gave them boundless strength. They decided to concentrate the remaining water in the tank to raise the water level and ensure the boiler had water. If this method failed, the three of them would carry water on their shoulders and hands to fill the tank, ensuring the normal operation of the train. Driver Liu Youzhi and fireman Wang Shizhen climbed into the tank, standing in the icy water, continuously bailing water. When their feet went numb from the cold, they loudly recited Chairman Mao's quotations.

After a tense battle, they finally solved the train's water problem. When the whistle joyfully announced the departure to the passengers, a wave of enthusiastic cheers of "Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years!" erupted in the long carriages.

	Mutual help, mutual improvement

Some time ago, veteran worker Wang Yuhe saw a young worker influenced by anarchist trends, idling around. Old Wang saw this and felt pained. He worked harder to set an example for the young man. However, after a period, the effect was not significant.

What caused this young man to be like this? Wang Yuhe, with this question in mind, carefully studied Chairman Mao's works. Chairman Mao said, "Youth, even young workers, because they have not suffered the hardships of the old society, should strengthen class education and raise their ideological awareness." Chairman Mao's teachings illuminated Old Wang's heart, making him realize that to make the younger generation become revolutionary successors, besides leading by example, one must also educate them with Mao Zedong Thought and guide them to advance on the revolutionary path indicated by Chairman Mao. Young people, mostly born in hardship and raised in sweetness, do not deeply feel the bitterness of the old society or the sweetness of the new society. One should tell them more about the bitterness of the old society.

From then on, Old Wang became even busier. He was often seen having heart-to-heart talks with young workers. Once, a young worker did not report for duty for several days. Old Wang found him and studied Chairman Mao's works together, kindly saying to him, "Before liberation, I worked as a fireman on the Yuehan Railway. Once, I pulled a Nationalist Party military train, and because the locomotive malfunctioned, I was beaten and imprisoned for two months..."

Liberation came, and Chairman Mao led us workers to stand up. In this unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, he led us to smash the Chinese Khrushchev's plot to restore capitalism. We must not hold back our strength in grasping revolution and promoting production, or we will be ungrateful to Chairman Mao!

Under Old Wang's patient guidance, this young worker raised his class consciousness, consciously fought against selfishness, and joined the "Revolution and Production Crew Combat Group."

    毛主席的红色铁路工人
    编辑同志：
    我们怀着对毛主席的无限忠诚，来到了广州铁路局衡阳机务段，接受了支左的光荣任务。在为期半年的时间里，我们和机务段的广大无产阶级革命派战斗在一起，生活在一起，亲眼看到了用毛泽东思想武装起来的铁路工人，是怎样迎着阶级斗争的风浪，用实际行动执行毛主席提出的“抓革命，促生产”伟大方针的。
    前一时期，阶级敌人假手反动的无政府主义，企图搅乱铁路正常运输秩序。就在这个时刻，衡阳机务段的广大无产阶级革命派，在毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的号召下，自动组成了“抓革命促生产乘务战斗组”，坚决抵制了无政府主义歪风。参加这个组的同志提出：无论在什么情况下，决不能使列车在衡阳地区停摆或晚点；要增加货运运输，保证客运列车畅通。许多同志发扬勇敢战斗、不怕牺牲、不怕疲劳和连续作战的作风，哪里有困难，就到哪里去。他们还互相帮助，互相促进，互相提高，全段的革命和生产一片热气腾腾。
    衡阳机务段广大无产阶级革命派的先进行动，使我们受到很大的鼓舞和教育。这里介绍的是他们日常工作中的几个片断。
  　解放军某部驻衡阳机务段支左人员
      司机顶司炉
    初升的太阳把衡阳车站照得通红。老司机邓达全下班后，没有回家，也没有吃饭，迎着朝阳，径直朝客运站走来。
    他每次下班照例都要到车站走走，看看有些什么事情需要他去做。这已经成了他的习惯了。他常说：“我们是毛主席的红色铁路工人，开的是火车头，可要真正起到火车头的作用。”
    老邓正走着，迎面跑来司机张学祥，他拦住问道：
      “老张，干啥去？”
    老张说：“××次直快马上就要开车，司炉同志临时有事不能出车，我现在去找人！”
      “不用找，我来顶！”老邓一看表，离开车时间只有几分钟了，便斩钉截铁地说：“走，决不能让列车晚点！”
    老张说：“不行，你刚下班，又有腰痛病，连续当班吃不消。”老邓拍拍胸膛，响亮地回答：“‘什么叫工作，工作就是斗争。’毛主席这样教导我们，我们就要坚决去做。”
      “不！你无论如何去不得！再说司机顶司炉，也从来没有这么个规矩呀！”老张坚持自己的意见，不让老邓出乘。没想到这一句话，激怒了这位在旧社会里当了十几年牛马的老工人。他激动地冲着老张说：“什么司机不能顶司炉，这是中国赫鲁晓夫的规矩！我们是毛主席的红色铁路工人，毛主席‘抓革命，促生产’的伟大号召，才是我们工人阶级的规矩！”老邓一席话，说得老张心里热呼呼的。
    开车信号已经发出，老邓操起铁锹，把一铲铲煤熟练地送进炉膛。列车一声长鸣，正点从衡阳发出了。它披着金色的阳光，奔驰在湘江畔的原野上。
    决不能让列车停摆
    一天晚上，××次普通客车到达某车站时，水柜里的水位大幅度下降，锅炉已经上水困难。这个车站又无给水设备，眼看列车就要停摆了。调度值班员根据他们的实际困难，在电话里命令他们甩掉车厢，放单机回衡阳加水。
    这时，司机刘友志的思想在激烈地斗争着，他想车上数百名旅客中，有响应伟大领袖毛主席的号召，回学校复课闹革命的红卫兵小将；有到各地执行“三支”、“两军”任务的解放军；有奔赴各个战斗岗位的工人、农民……。如果让列车停摆，就会直接影响毛主席的最新指示的落实。再说，旅客的吃饭、喝水等问题也将发生困难。要想尽办法把列车开出去。
    遇到了问题首先向毛主席著作请教，刘友志和副司机、司炉们共同学习了毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的指示和《为人民服务》这篇光辉著作。毛主席著作给了他们无穷的力量。他们决定把水柜里剩下的水集中起来用提高水位的办法保证锅炉用水。如果这个方法不行，三个人用肩挑手提，也要把水柜灌满，保证列车正常运行。司机刘友志和司炉王世珍两人钻进水柜，站在刺骨的冷水里，不停地舀水，脚冻麻木了，他们就高声朗读毛主席语录。
    经过一场紧张的战斗，终于解决了列车用水。当汽笛欢叫着向旅客们报告开车的喜讯时，长长的车厢里，爆发出一片“毛主席万岁！万万岁！”的热烈欢呼声。
  互相帮助　互相提高
    前些日子，老工人王玉和见到一个青年工人受了无政府主义思潮的影响，在一旁遛跶，老王看在眼里，痛在心上。他暗自下劲儿干工作，想用自己的实际行动来带动这个青年人。可是，经过一个时期，效果不十分显著。
    是什么原因使这个青年人成了这个样子呢？王玉和带着这个问题，认真学习了毛主席著作。毛主席说：“青年，即使是青年工人，因为没有受过旧社会的苦，更应该加强阶级教育，提高他们的思想觉悟。”毛主席的教导，拨亮了老王的心，使他认识到，要使青年一代成为革命的接班人，除自己以身作则以外，还必须用毛泽东思想教育他们，引导他们沿着毛主席指引的革命轨道前进。青年人，大都是苦里生、甜里长，对旧社会的苦体会不深，对新社会的甜也感受不深。应该多给他们讲讲旧社会的苦。
    从此，老王更是忙碌了。经常看到他和青年工人倾心交谈。有一次有一个青年工人几天没有出勤，老王就找他一起学习毛主席著作，对他亲切地说，解放前我在粤汉路上当司炉工，有一次拉一列国民党的军车，因为机车出故障，为此，我被揍了一顿，还坐了两个月班房……。
    解放了，毛主席领导我们工人翻了身，在这场史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命中，他老人家又领着我们粉碎了中国赫鲁晓夫复辟资本主义的阴谋。我们不把全部力量拿出来抓革命促生产，就对不起毛主席！
    在老王的耐心帮助下，这个青年工人提高了阶级觉悟，自觉斗掉了私心，并参加了“抓革命促生产乘务战斗组”。
