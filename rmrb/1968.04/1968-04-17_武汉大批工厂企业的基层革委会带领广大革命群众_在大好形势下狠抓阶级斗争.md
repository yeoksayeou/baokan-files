In the unprecedentedly favorable situation of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the basic revolutionary committees of numerous factories and enterprises in Wuhan have firmly grasped the key issue of the struggle between the two classes, the two lines, and the two roads. They have led the proletariat and the broad revolutionary masses to launch an unceasing attack on the class enemy, advancing bravely in the stormy waves of class struggle, demonstrating a powerful vitality.

A large number of basic units' revolutionary committees have followed Chairman Mao's great teaching of "never forgetting class struggle," firmly holding high the banner of revolutionary criticism, firmly grasping the direction of the struggle, and leading the proletariat and the broad revolutionary masses to launch an even more fierce attack on the handful of capitalist roaders within the Party, headed by China's Khrushchev. Under the leadership of the revolutionary committees, the revolutionary big-character posters and big debates in many factories and enterprises have been carried out more extensively and deeply. Many factory and enterprise revolutionary committees have paid special attention to combining various specific tasks with the revolutionary big-character posters and big debates.

In leading the masses to carry out the revolutionary big-character posters and big debates, the revolutionary committees of many factories and enterprises in Wuhan have done a good job of using Chairman Mao's latest instructions to guide the revolutionary big-character posters and big debates, and at the same time, further implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions in the revolutionary big-character posters and big debates. The revolutionary committee of Wuhan Enamelware Factory has, in combination with the actual class struggle in the factory, carried out revolutionary big-character posters and big debates. Each time, there is a central theme, concentrating on criticizing one aspect of China's Khrushchev's counter-revolutionary revisionist fallacies, and vigorously implementing one aspect of Chairman Mao's latest instructions.

The revolutionary committees of various factories and enterprises in Wuhan, which were born in the stormy waves of class struggle, have kept in mind Chairman Mao's great teaching that "the imperialists and domestic reactionaries will never reconcile themselves to their defeat, and they will make their last struggle." They have closely watched the new trends in class struggle, constantly armed the leading cadres and revolutionary masses with Chairman Mao's theory, line, policy, method, and principle of continuing the revolution under the dictatorship of the proletariat, distinguishing right from wrong, and clarifying the enemy. They have struck the class enemy accurately, fiercely, and steadily. The revolutionary committee of Wuhan Gelatin Factory timely exposed the class enemy's plot to overthrow the revolutionary committee, mobilizing the revolutionary masses of the entire factory to attack the class enemy, isolating the bad elements, and consolidating the revolutionary committee. Not long ago, a counter-revolutionary economism wind blew through Wuhan Boiler Factory. The factory revolutionary committee seriously studied Chairman Mao's great teachings on class, class contradictions, and class struggle, realizing that the poison of the counter-revolutionary revisionist line pushed by a handful of capitalist roaders within the Party has not been completely eliminated, and that the ghost of the capitalist roaders has not been dispelled. The revolutionary committee mobilized the revolutionary masses of the entire factory to study the "Old Three Articles" while further establishing the thought of serving the people, and to carry out a big-character poster and big debate in each workshop and section, criticizing China's Khrushchev and his agent Wang Renzhong's line of "material incentives" and "profits first" in running the factory. The revolutionary masses bitterly denounced the suffering of being exploited by the capitalists in the old society and exposed China's Khrushchev's crimes of corrupting the workers. The class consciousness of the proletariat was greatly enhanced, and the awareness of class struggle was greatly strengthened, timely repelling this counter-revolutionary economism wind.

Many factory and enterprise revolutionary committees in Wuhan have deeply felt from the practice of class struggle that to grasp class struggle, one must first grasp the thought revolutionization of the leading cadres. The revolutionary committee of Hanshan Rolling Mill has, in order to firmly establish the idea of emphasizing proletarian politics, criticized China's Khrushchev and a handful of capitalist roaders within the Party's reactionary fallacies of "production and technology first," raising their own understanding of emphasizing proletarian politics, and putting the study and application of Mao Zedong Thought in the first place in all work. To closely connect with the masses, the fifteen members of the revolutionary committee have all gone down to the workshops, construction sites, and canteens, strengthening their contact with the masses. Other revolutionary committees of many factories and enterprises have also paid great attention to the thought revolutionization of the leading cadres, regarding this as a major matter of ensuring that the proletarian revolutionary power will never change color, and have formulated various systems and requirements.

At present, the revolutionary committees of many factories and enterprises in Wuhan are leading the proletariat and the broad revolutionary masses to take the thorough implementation of Chairman Mao's series of latest instructions as the fundamental task, extensively carrying out the "three loyalties" activity of being forever loyal to Chairman Mao, forever loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, and forever loyal to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. Their experience is: the red heart of being infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao should be tempered in class struggle, the study and application of Mao Zedong Thought should be practiced in class struggle, and Chairman Mao's latest instructions should be implemented in class struggle.

    武汉大批工厂企业的基层革委会带领广大革命群众
    在大好形势下狠抓阶级斗争
    据新华社武汉十六日电　在无产阶级文化大革命的空前大好形势下，武汉市大批工厂、企业的基层革命委员会，狠狠抓住两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的斗争这个纲，带领无产阶级和广大革命群众一刻也不停顿地向阶级敌人发动进攻，在阶级斗争的大风大浪中奋勇前进，显示了强大的生命力。
    大批基层单位的革命委员会，遵循毛主席“千万不要忘记阶级斗争”的伟大教导，坚定地高举革命的批判大旗，牢牢掌握斗争大方向，带领无产阶级和广大革命群众向中国赫鲁晓夫等党内最大的一小撮走资派，发动了更加猛烈的进攻。许多工厂、企业的革命大批判运动，在革命委员会的领导下，开展得更加广泛，更加深入。许多工厂、企业的革命委员会，特别注意结合各项具体任务，开展革命的大批判。
    武汉市许多工厂、企业的革委会在领导群众深入开展革命大批判的时候，做到了以毛主席的最新指示来指导革命的大批判，同时在革命大批判中进一步落实毛主席的最新指示。武汉搪瓷厂革委会结合本厂阶级斗争的实际，开展革命大批判。每次都有一个中心，集中批判中国赫鲁晓夫一个方面的反革命修正主义谬论，大力落实毛主席一个方面的最新指示。
    在阶级斗争急风暴雨中诞生的武汉各工厂、企业的革命委员会，牢记毛主席关于“帝国主义者和国内反动派决不甘心于他们的失败，他们还要作最后的挣扎”的伟大教导，密切注意阶级斗争的新动向，不断以毛主席关于无产阶级专政条件下继续革命的理论、路线、方针、方法和政策武装领导班子和革命群众，分辨是非，分清敌我。他们对阶级敌人打得准、打得狠、打得稳。武汉明胶厂革委会及时识破阶级敌人妄图颠覆革委会的阴谋，发动全厂革命群众向阶级敌人进攻，孤立了坏人，巩固了革命委员会。不久以前，武汉锅炉厂内刮起了一股反革命经济主义妖风。厂革委会认真学习了毛主席关于阶级、阶级矛盾和阶级斗争的伟大教导，认清了这是党内一小撮走资派推行的反革命修正主义路线的流毒还没有肃清，是走资派的阴魂未散，革委会发动全厂革命群众一边大学“老三篇”，进一步树立为人民服务的思想，一边按车间、科室开展对中国赫鲁晓夫及其代理人王任重之流推行的“物质刺激”、“利润挂帅”等修正主义办厂路线的大批判。革命群众大诉在旧社会受资本家剥削之苦，大揭中国赫鲁晓夫腐蚀工人的罪行，无产阶级觉悟大大提高，阶级斗争观念大大增强，及时地击退了这股反革命经济主义妖风。
    武汉市许多工厂、企业的革命委员会，从阶级斗争的实践中深刻地体会到，要抓好阶级斗争，首先必须抓好领导班子的思想革命化。汉阳轧钢厂革委会为了使领导班子牢固地树立突出无产阶级政治的观念，他们大批中国赫鲁晓夫等党内一小撮走资派的“生产、技术第一”的反动谬论，提高自己对突出无产阶级政治的认识，把活学活用毛泽东思想放在一切工作的首位。为了密切联系群众，十五个革委会成员纷纷下到车间、工地、食堂，加强了和群众的联系。其他许多工厂企业的革委会，也都十分重视领导班子的思想革命化，他们把这看做是保证无产阶级革命政权永不变色的大事，并订出了各种制度和要求。
    目前，武汉市许多工厂、企业的革命委员会正带领无产阶级和广大革命群众，以全面落实毛主席的一系列最新指示为根本任务，广泛开展永远忠于毛主席、永远忠于毛泽东思想、永远忠于毛主席无产阶级革命路线的“三忠于”活动。他们的体会是：无限忠于毛主席的红心要在阶级斗争中锤炼，活学活用毛泽东思想要在阶级斗争中实践，毛主席的最新指示要在阶级斗争中落实。
