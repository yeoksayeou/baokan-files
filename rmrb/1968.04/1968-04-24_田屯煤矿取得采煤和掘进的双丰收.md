Tian Tun Coal Mine Achieves Double Harvest in Mining and Tunneling

The revolutionary workers of Tian Tun Coal Mine, under the guidance of the People's Liberation Army stationed at the mine, have established various types of Mao Zedong Thought study classes. These classes have effectively resisted the influence of anarchist tendencies, strengthened the revolutionary, scientific, and organizational discipline of the proletariat, and achieved double victories in both revolution and production. The mine has completed its first-quarter coal production and tunneling targets 25 days and 19 days ahead of schedule, respectively.

Tian Tun Coal Mine is one of the earliest units in the Zaozhuang mining area to achieve revolutionary great alliance and revolutionary three-in-one combination. Since the revolutionary masses took power in August last year, significant achievements have been made in both revolution and production. However, due to the presence of anarchist thoughts among some workers, further progress in revolution and production has been hindered. Therefore, the revolutionary committee of Tian Tun Coal Mine organized Mao Zedong Thought study classes to help cadres overcome their fears and dare to resist the infiltration of anarchist tendencies. The entire mine quickly developed a new atmosphere. When there are anarchist thoughts among the masses, cadres boldly criticize and resist; when cadres have fears, the masses enthusiastically criticize and help. Now, cadres and leaders of the revolutionary committees at all levels in the mine actively go to the production front lines, participate in underground production labor, and work together with the broad masses of miners, discuss together, criticize and repudiate revisionism together, promoting both revolution and production.

    田屯煤矿取得采煤和掘进的双丰收
    山东省枣庄矿务局田屯煤矿广大革命职工，在驻矿解放军的帮助下，开办各种类型的毛泽东思想学习班，有效地抵制了无政府主义思潮的影响，加强了无产阶级的革命性、科学性和组织纪律性，取得了革命、生产的双胜利。全矿已分别提前二十五天和十九天完成了第一季度的原煤生产和掘进进尺计划。
    田屯煤矿是枣庄矿区各矿中较早实现革命大联合和革命三结合的一个单位。无产阶级革命派自去年八月掌权以来，革命和生产取得很大成绩。但是，由于部分职工中存在着无政府主义思想，影响了革命和生产的进一步发展。于是，田屯煤矿革委会举办毛泽东思想学习班，帮助干部去掉怕字，换上敢字，大胆地抵制无政府主义思潮的侵袭。全矿很快形成一种新风气。群众中有无政府主义思想，干部就大胆地批评、抵制；干部有“怕”字，群众就热情地批评帮助。现在，全矿各级干部和革命委员会的负责人都主动地深入生产第一线，参加井下生产劳动，他们和广大矿工生产在一起，商量在一起，斗私批修在一起，促进了革命和生产。
