The Working Committee of the Muslim Conference of Jammu and Kashmir passed a resolution on April 7 condemning Soviet revisionists' military aid to India.

The resolution stated that the Soviet leaders boast about their policy of aiding people who love freedom, but in reality, they have aided the Indian oppressors in Kashmir.

The resolution pointed out that no matter how much foreign military aid there is, it cannot save the Indian oppressors from being ultimately defeated by the people of Jammu and Kashmir, who are fighting to the death for their right to self-determination.

    谴责苏修对印进行军事援助
    新华社拉瓦尔品第八日电　据巴基斯坦联合通讯社报道，查谟和克什米尔穆斯林会议工作委员会七日通过一项决议，谴责苏修对印度的军事援助。
    决议说，苏联领导人自吹奉行援助爱好自由的人民的政策，但实际上却援助了在克什米尔的印度压迫者。
    决议指出，不管有多少外国的军事援助，都挽救不了印度压迫者被正在为争取自己的自决权而进行生死搏斗的查谟和克什米尔人民最后打败的命运。
