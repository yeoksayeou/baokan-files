Air Force units loyal to Chairman Mao have consecutively achieved major victories in shooting down U.S. imperialist unmanned aircraft. Celebratory meetings were held in Southwest and South China.

The meetings read out the commendation order from the Central Military Commission of the Communist Party of China. The meetings encouraged the troops to raise the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought higher, to seize the revolution and promote preparedness, to heighten revolutionary vigilance a hundredfold, and to resolutely annihilate any invading enemy, thus making new contributions to the defense of the motherland and the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

Xinhua News Agency, April 8th: The People's Liberation Army Air Force, which is infinitely loyal to the great teacher of the proletariat, Chairman Mao, held a grand celebratory meeting in a certain location in Southwest China on the afternoon of the 7th to celebrate the major victory of shooting down a U.S. imperialist high-altitude reconnaissance drone that intruded into our airspace on March 15th for reconnaissance and provocation.

The meeting hall was adorned with prominent slogans reading, "Forever loyal to Chairman Mao, forever loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, forever loyal to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line." In the center of the stage, a giant portrait of our most beloved great leader, Chairman Mao, was hung. The enthusiastic atmosphere of the meeting fully reflected the air force's broad ranks of officers and soldiers' boundless loyalty to the great leader, Chairman Mao, their boundless loyalty to the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, and their boundless loyalty to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line.

The meeting began with the songs "The East is Red" and "Long Live Chairman Mao." The officers and soldiers attending the meeting recited Chairman Mao's quotations: "Imperialists and domestic reactionaries will not willingly accept their defeat. They will still make their final struggles. After the country is pacified, they will still engage in sabotage and disruption in various ways. They will try to restore their power in China every day and every hour. This is inevitable and undeniable. We must never relax our vigilance."

Cui Wenbin, a responsible person from a certain unit of the Air Force, read out the commendation order from the Central Military Commission on behalf of the Air Force leadership, and presented revolutionary books such as "Selected Works of Mao Zedong," "Quotations from Chairman Mao," and shining Mao badges, as well as certificates of merit to the units and individuals who performed well in the battle.

The meeting believed that the victory of the battle on March 15th was the result of the participating units and soldiers following the teachings of Vice Chairman Lin, having a "loyal" heart towards the great leader, Chairman Mao, and grasping the "use" of the invincible Mao Zedong Thought. It was the result of everyone being united and loyal to Chairman Mao. This victory greatly encouraged the entire military and people of the nation who are striving for a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and dealt a heavy blow to the U.S. imperialists who have been continuously provoking war against our country.

The meeting pointed out that while we celebrate our victory, we must always remember the teachings of the great leader, Chairman Mao: "In human history, all reactionary forces that are about to perish will make their final struggles against the revolutionary forces," "Make trouble, fail, make trouble again, fail again, until they perish—this is the logic of imperialism and all reactionaries in the world towards the people's cause. They will not deviate from this logic." The U.S. imperialists, who have been beaten to a standstill and have nowhere to go by the Vietnamese people, will not willingly accept their defeat. Domestically, traitors, spies, a handful of stubborn walking capitalists within the revolutionary ranks, and unrepentant landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists will inevitably make their final struggles. Therefore, we must never relax our fighting will. We must raise the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought higher, take Vice Chairman Lin as a shining example, follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, fully implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions, strengthen the class struggle consciousness, seize the revolution, promote preparedness, heighten revolutionary vigilance a hundredfold, and make new contributions to the defense of national security and the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

Wang Zhixin, a representative of the meritorious soldiers, spoke at the meeting with boundless revolutionary passion for the great leader, Chairman Mao. He expressed his determination to always remember Chairman Mao's great teaching of "never forgetting class struggle," to resolutely defend Chairman Mao, Mao Zedong Thought, and Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. He said, "We must take Vice Chairman Lin as a shining example, be infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao, and always study and execute Chairman Mao's highest combat order of 'exerting all efforts to annihilate the invading enemy.'"

The meeting ended with the entire audience singing "Sailing the Seas Depends on the Helmsman" and repeatedly shouting in high spirits: "Long live Chairman Mao! Long, long live Chairman Mao!"

Xinhua News Agency, April 8th: The People's Liberation Army Air Force, which is infinitely loyal to the great leader, Chairman Mao, held a grand celebratory meeting in a certain location in South China on the afternoon of the 7th to celebrate the major victory of shooting down a U.S. imperialist high-altitude reconnaissance drone on March 22nd, and to commend the meritorious soldiers who are infinitely loyal to the great leader, Chairman Mao, infinitely loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, and infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line.

The center of the stage was adorned with a giant portrait of our most red sun, Chairman Mao. In front of the stage, a huge banner read, "Long live the great teacher, great leader, great supreme commander, and great helmsman, Chairman Mao!"

The meeting began with the majestic songs "The East is Red" and "Long Live Chairman Mao."

Wang Pu, a responsible person from a certain unit of the Air Force, read out the commendation order issued by the Central Military Commission on behalf of the Air Force leadership.

The commendation order stated: In the midst of the triumphant songs of the billion military and people of the nation striving for a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, you have, with your actual actions of being infinitely loyal to the great leader, Chairman Mao, shot down a U.S. imperialist high-altitude reconnaissance drone that intruded into our airspace for reconnaissance and provocation in the South China region. This is the result of your resolute execution of the series of latest instructions from the great leader, Chairman Mao, and Vice Chairman Lin. It is a new victory of the invincible Mao Zedong Thought. You are hereby commended.

The commendation order stated: Recently, the U.S. imperialists have continuously sent military aircraft to intrude into our airspace for reconnaissance and provocation. Under the powerful strikes of our air force units and naval aviation units, they have suffered shameful defeats. The aggressive nature of imperialism will not change. The great commander, Chairman Mao, teaches us: "The sovereignty of China's territory must be defended by the Chinese people and must not be allowed to be infringed upon by any foreign government." We hope that you will resolutely respond to the call of Vice Chairman Lin, raise the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought higher, better study and apply Mao Zedong Thought, further promote the revolutionization of people's thinking, heighten vigilance, strengthen preparedness, and resolutely, thoroughly, and completely annihilate any invading enemy.

When the commendation order from the Central Military Commission was read out, the entire audience erupted in prolonged cheers of "Long live Chairman Mao! Long, long live Chairman Mao!"

Wang Pu then presented revolutionary books such as "Selected Works of Mao Zedong," "Quotations from Chairman Mao," "Poems of Chairman Mao," as well as shining Mao badges and certificates of merit to the meritorious soldiers on behalf of the Air Force leadership.

The meeting encouraged the broad ranks of officers and soldiers to always remember the great teachings of the great leader, Chairman Mao, of "never forgetting class struggle," to seriously study and implement the instructions of Vice Chairman Lin, to heighten the consciousness of class struggle and line struggle, to deeply carry out the revolutionary great criticism, to criticize and expose China's Khrushchev and other handful of walking capitalists within the party from political, ideological, and theoretical perspectives, to thoroughly eliminate their influence and poison, and to carry the class struggle, the struggle between two roads, and the struggle between two lines to the end. We must heighten vigilance, strengthen preparedness, firmly establish the idea of being prepared at all times, do our work better, and strive to make new contributions to the people.

Chen Huiqing, a representative of the meritorious soldiers, expressed his determination at the meeting to have a "loyal" heart towards the great leader, Chairman Mao, to grasp the "use" of the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, to study and apply Chairman Mao's brilliant works "Old Five Articles" and the latest instructions from Chairman Mao, to criticize and reform oneself, to thoroughly change one's worldview, to heighten revolutionary vigilance a hundredfold, to resolutely annihilate all invading enemies, and to make new contributions to the defense of the motherland and the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

A responsible person from the local revolutionary committee expressed warm congratulations to the meritorious units on behalf of the local revolutionary masses of all ethnic groups.

The meeting ended victoriously with the song "Sailing the Seas Depends on the Helmsman."

    永远忠于毛主席的空军战士连续取得击落美帝无人驾驶飞机的重大胜利
    空军部队分别在西南华南举行祝捷庆功大会
    会上宣读了中共中央军委的嘉奖令。大会勉励指战员更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，抓革命，促战备，百倍提高革命警惕，坚决消灭敢于来犯的敌人，为保卫祖国、保卫无产阶级文化大革命立新功
    新华社八日讯　无限忠于无产阶级的伟大导师毛主席的人民解放军空军某部，七日下午在西南某地隆重举行祝捷庆功大会，热烈庆祝三月十五日击落侵入我国领空进行侦察挑衅的美帝国主义军用无人驾驶高空侦察机一架的重大胜利。
    会场里写着醒目的“永远忠于毛主席，永远忠于毛泽东思想，永远忠于毛主席的无产阶级革命路线”的大字标语。主席台中央，悬挂着我们最最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席的巨幅画像。会场的热烈气氛，充分反映了空军广大指战员无限忠于伟大领袖毛主席、无限忠于战无不胜的毛泽东思想、无限忠于毛主席无产阶级革命路线的赤胆红心。
    大会在《东方红》、《祝福毛主席万寿无疆》的歌声中开始。参加大会的指战员们齐声朗诵毛主席语录：“帝国主义者和国内反动派决不甘心于他们的失败，他们还要作最后的挣扎。在全国平定以后，他们也还会以各种方式从事破坏和捣乱，他们将每日每时企图在中国复辟。这是必然的，毫无疑义的，我们务必不要松懈自己的警惕性。”
    空军某部负责人崔文斌代表空军领导机关，宣读了中共中央军委的嘉奖令，并代表空军领导机关把革命宝书《毛泽东选集》、《毛主席语录》和金光闪闪的毛主席像章以及立功奖状授予作战有功单位和人员。
    大会认为，三月十五日战斗的胜利，是参战部队指战员遵照林彪副主席的教导，对伟大领袖毛主席心怀一个“忠”字，对战无不胜的毛泽东思想狠抓一个
  “用”字的结果；是指战员们上下一条心，人人忠于毛主席的结果。这次胜利，是对正在夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的全国军民的极大鼓舞，是对不断向我国进行战争挑衅的美帝国主义的沉重打击。
    大会指出，在我们庆祝胜利的时候，一定要牢记伟大领袖毛主席的教导：“在人类历史上，凡属将要灭亡的反动势力，总是要向革命势力进行最后挣扎的”，
  “捣乱，失败，再捣乱，再失败，直至灭亡——这就是帝国主义和世界上一切反动派对待人民事业的逻辑，他们决不会违背这个逻辑的。”被越南人民打得焦头烂额、走投无路的美帝国主义，决不会甘心于他们的失败。在国内，混入革命队伍内部的叛徒、特务，党内一小撮顽固不化的走资派以及没有改造好的地、富、反、坏、右分子，他们必然地要进行垂死的挣扎。因此，我们绝对不可以稍微松懈自己的战斗意志。我们要更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，以林副主席为光辉榜样，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，全面落实毛主席的最新指示，加强阶级斗争观念，抓革命，促战备，百倍地提高革命警惕，为保卫祖国安全，保卫无产阶级文化大革命立新功。
    作战有功人员代表王志信怀着对伟大领袖毛主席无限忠诚的革命激情在会上讲话，他表示一定要牢记毛主席“千万不要忘记阶级斗争”的伟大教导，坚决保卫毛主席，保卫毛泽东思想，保卫毛主席的无产阶级革命路线。他说，我们一定要以林副主席为光辉榜样，无限忠于毛主席，对毛主席的“全力以赴，务歼入侵之敌”的最高战斗命令，要天天学习，坚决执行。
    大会结束时，全场高唱《大海航行靠舵手》，一遍又一遍地纵情欢呼：“毛主席万岁！毛主席万万岁！”
    新华社八日讯　无限忠于伟大领袖毛主席的人民解放军空军某部，七日下午在华南某地隆重举行祝捷庆功大会，热烈庆祝三月二十二日一举击落美帝国主义军用无人驾驶高空侦察机一架的重大胜利，表彰无限忠于伟大领袖毛主席、无限忠于毛泽东思想、无限忠于毛主席无产阶级革命路线的作战有功人员。
    大会主席台中央高悬着我们心中最红最红的红太阳毛主席的巨幅画像，台前挂着“伟大的导师、伟大的领袖、伟大的统帅、伟大的舵手毛主席万岁”的巨幅横额。
    大会在雄壮的《东方红》、《祝福毛主席万寿无疆》的歌声中开始。
    空军某部负责人王璞代表空军领导机关宣读了中共中央军委颁发的嘉奖令。
    嘉奖令说，在全国亿万军民夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的凯歌声中，你们以无限忠于伟大领袖毛主席的实际行动，在华南地区一举击落侵入我国领空进行侦察挑衅的美帝国主义军用无人驾驶高空侦察机一架。这是你们坚决执行伟大领袖毛主席的一系列最新指示和林副主席指示的结果，是战无不胜的毛泽东思想的新胜利，特予通令嘉奖。
    嘉奖令说，最近以来，美帝国主义连续派遣军用飞机侵入我国领空进行侦察挑衅，在我空军部队和海军航空兵部队的有力打击下，遭到了可耻的失败。帝国主义的侵略本性是不会改变的。伟大统帅毛主席教导我们：“中国的领土主权，中国人民必须保卫，绝对不允许外国政府来侵犯。”希望你们坚决响应林副主席的号召，更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，更好地活学活用毛泽东思想，进一步搞好人的思想革命化，提高警惕，加强战备，对敢于来犯的敌人，坚决彻底干净全部消灭之。
    大会宣读中共中央军委嘉奖令时，全场响起了经久不息的“毛主席万岁！万万岁！”的欢呼声。
    接着，王璞代表空军领导机关把革命宝书《毛泽东选集》、《毛主席语录》、《毛主席诗词》以及金光闪闪的毛主席像章和立功奖状授予作战有功人员。
    大会勉励广大指战员牢记伟大领袖毛主席“千万不要忘记阶级斗争”的伟大教导，认真学习、贯彻林副主席的指示，提高阶级斗争和路线斗争观念，深入开展革命的大批判，从政治上、思想上、理论上把中国赫鲁晓夫等党内最大的一小撮走资派批深批透、斗倒斗臭，彻底肃清他们的影响和流毒，把两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线斗争进行到底。一定要提高警惕，加强战备，牢固树立常备不懈的思想，把工作做得好上加好，争取为人民再立新功。
    作战有功人员代表陈辉亭在会上表示，决心对伟大领袖毛主席心怀一个“忠”字，对战无不胜的毛泽东思想狠抓一个“用”字，活学活用毛主席的光辉著作“老五篇”和毛主席的最新指示，斗私批修，彻底改造世界观；要百倍提高革命警惕性，坚决消灭一切敢于来犯的敌人，为保卫祖国、保卫无产阶级文化大革命再立新功。
