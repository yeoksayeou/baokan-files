More than ten thousand workers and patriotic students from Tokyo, Osaka, Nagasaki, Fukuoka, Yamagata, Miyagi, Hokkaido, and other places held a rally in Tokyo on the afternoon of April 21st to strongly oppose U.S. imperialism's aggression against Vietnam and resolutely support the struggle of American blacks against violence.

The rally exposed the new conspiracy of "peace talks" played by the Johnson administration on the Vietnam issue and angrily denounced the Sato reactionary government's crime of aiding U.S. imperialism in its aggression against Vietnam.

Workers and student representatives spoke at the rally, expressing the determination of the Japanese people to join the heroic Vietnamese people in striking back against U.S. imperialism. They enthusiastically praised the struggle of American blacks against violence.

After the rally, workers and students marched in columns to the front of the Japanese Prime Minister's official residence and the U.S. Embassy in Japan to hold a demonstration. The Sato reactionary government was frightened by this anti-U.S. demonstration, deploying more than six thousand armed police and armored vehicles to suppress the demonstrators and arbitrarily arresting fourteen patriotic students.

The demonstrators resolutely fought back against the police. They shouted, "Down with U.S. imperialism!" "U.S. imperialism, get out of Japan, Vietnam, and Asia!" "Support the struggle of American blacks!"

The anti-U.S. demonstration by workers and students received the support of the broad masses of citizens. Many citizens voluntarily joined the march.

The powerful anti-U.S. demonstration brought traffic in the center of Tokyo to a standstill.

On the same night, two thousand patriotic students and Tokyo citizens held a rally and demonstration, opposing the new establishment of a U.S. military field hospital in Tokyo.

Revolutionary demonstrators in Yamaguchi Prefecture marched to oppose U.S. imperialism's aggression and demand the withdrawal of U.S. military bases.

    大会结束后，工人和学生列队到日本首相官邸和美国驻日大使馆门前举行示威游行。佐藤反动政府被这一反美示威吓得胆战心惊，出动了六千多名武装警察和装甲车镇压示威群众，并无理逮捕了十四名爱国学生。
    示威群众同警察进行了坚决斗争。人们高呼：“打倒美帝！”“美帝从日本、越南和亚洲滚出去！”“支持美国黑人的斗争！”
    工人和学生的反美示威得到了广大市民的支持。许多市民自动地加入到游行行列中。
