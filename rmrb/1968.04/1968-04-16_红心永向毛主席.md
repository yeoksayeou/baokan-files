	Hearts Forever Loyal to Chairman Mao
	Fishing Village Great Team, Shandong Village Commune, Pinggu County, Wang Jìnzhōng

	The Chinese Khrushchev viciously slanders us poor and lower-middle peasants, saying, "Don't think that those who oppose individual farming are all collectivists." He wants to suppress our poor and lower-middle peasants' socialist enthusiasm, which is extremely reactionary!

	We poor and lower-middle peasants are infinitely loyal to the great leader Chairman Mao. As early as the initial period of the Anti-Japanese War, the poor and lower-middle peasants of Yuzishan were wholeheartedly following Chairman Mao in revolution, establishing the first red base area in Pinggu County. In the days of continuous gunfire, we poor and lower-middle peasants were the vanguard in bravely fighting the enemy. In the struggle between the two classes and two roads, we poor and lower-middle peasants' hearts are with Chairman Mao, forever revolutionary and never wavering. In the early days of agricultural cooperation, the Chinese Khrushchev severely cut down the cooperatives, and the untransformed landlords, rich farmers, counter-revolutionaries, and bad elements in our village followed suit in destroying the cooperatives. Some rich peasants with serious capitalist spontaneous tendencies caused trouble, wanting to withdraw from the cooperatives. It was we poor and lower-middle peasants who firmly remembered Chairman Mao's teachings, steadfastly running the cooperatives well under difficult conditions. During the three years of temporary difficulties, the Chinese Khrushchev spread the black wind of individual farming, and the capitalist roaders within the Party pointed at us, demanding that we divide the hillside fields among households. We poor and lower-middle peasants saw through their wolfish ambitions and resolutely stopped this capitalist evil wind. Not only did we not divide the land among households, but we also handed over all the small plots of wasteland opened up in the previous two years to the collective.

	I am an old poor peasant. Under Chairman Mao's leadership, I have been a village cadre for more than twenty years. During this period, the Chinese Khrushchev's revisionist line has struck me many times; Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line has rescued me time and again. In the sharp and complex class struggle, no matter how great the difficulties and setbacks, I have never fallen. In this Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, I firmly stand on Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. When the masses put up big-character posters against me, I did not resist. The more big-character posters there were, the tighter I grasped my work. When establishing the revolutionary leading group, some cadres had grievances and did not want to stand up and work. I gathered the cadres together for a heart-to-heart talk. I told them, "In the past, we suffered from cold and hunger and did not even have the right to speak, all because we did not have power. Chairman Mao personally initiated and led this Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution precisely to ensure that the revolutionary masses of the proletariat firmly grasp the reins of power. If it were not for this Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the Chinese Khrushchev would have usurped power, and at that time, it would not be the poor and lower-middle peasants choosing us to be cadres, but the landlords and rich farmers finding us to counterattack and settle scores. Mao Zedong Thought has made everyone stand tall and actively work.

	Father and mother are dear, but not as dear as Chairman Mao. No matter how good it is, it is not as good as socialism. Under the nurturing of Mao Zedong Thought, we poor and lower-middle peasants are steadfast proletarian revolutionaries. On the road to agricultural collectivization, difficulties cannot defeat us poor and lower-middle peasants; the sabotage of class enemies cannot frighten us; the persecution of the bourgeois reactionary line cannot crush us. We poor and lower-middle peasants, because we have deep bitterness and hatred, and because we have armed our minds with Mao Zedong Thought, are thus the most revolutionary and the most supportive of socialism.

	Chairman Mao said, "The main force that has long been fighting and struggling in the countryside is the poor peasants." "The poor peasants are the most enthusiastic about collectivization." This is the greatest trust and support from the great leader Chairman Mao to us poor and lower-middle peasants. Chairman Mao supports us, and we make Chairman Mao proud. We must forever be loyal to Chairman Mao, forever loyal to the great Mao Zedong Thought, forever loyal to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, and fiercely criticize the Chinese Khrushchev's bourgeois reactionary line, run the people's communes well, strengthen the dictatorship of the proletariat, and ensure that the socialist mountains and rivers do not change color.

    红心永向毛主席
    平谷县山东庄公社鱼子山大队　王进忠
    中国赫鲁晓夫恶狠狠地污蔑我们贫下中农说：“不要以为反对单干的就都是集体主义者。”他想把我们贫下中农的社会主义积极性打下去，真是反动透顶！
    我们贫下中农无限忠于伟大领袖毛主席。早在抗日战争初期，我们鱼子山的贫下中农，就忠心耿耿地跟着毛主席闹革命，建立起平谷县第一块红色根据地。在炮火连天的年代里，我们贫下中农是英勇杀敌的先锋。在两个阶级、两条道路的斗争中，我们贫下中农红心向着毛主席，永远革命不变心。农业合作化初期，中国赫鲁晓夫大砍合作社，我村没有改造好的地富反坏分子跟着破坏合作社，有些有严重资本主义自发倾向的富裕农民闹着退出合作社。是我们贫下中农把毛主席的教导牢记心头，在困难条件下，坚定不移地办好合作社。三年暂时困难时期，中国赫鲁晓夫大刮单干黑风，党内走资派指着鼻子要我们把山坡地分到户。我们贫下中农，又看穿了他们的狼子野心，坚决刹住这股资本主义妖风。我们不但没有把地分到户，相反，连前两年开的小片荒地，也全部交给了集体。
    我是一个老贫农，在毛主席领导下，当了二十多年的村干部。在这期间，中国赫鲁晓夫的修正主义路线，给了我多次打击；毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，一次又一次地把我拯救出来。在那尖锐复杂的阶级斗争中，不管有多大的困难和挫折，我都没有倒下。在这次无产阶级文化大革命中，我坚定地站在毛主席的无产阶级革命路线一边。群众给我贴大字报，我没有抵触。大字报越是多，我的工作越是抓得紧。成立革命领导班子的时候，有的干部有些委屈情绪，不愿意站起来干。我就把干部们找在一起谈心。我向他们说，过去咱们挨冻受饿，连说话的权利都没有，不就是因为没有政权吗？毛主席亲自发动和领导这场无产阶级文化大革命，为的啥，就是叫无产阶级革命派牢牢掌握住印把子。要是没有这场无产阶级文化大革命，中国赫鲁晓夫专了政，到那个时候，不是贫下中农挑咱们当干部，该是地主、富农找咱们反攻倒算了。毛泽东思想使大家挺起了腰杆，积极地干起来。
    爹亲娘亲，不如毛主席亲。千好万好，不如社会主义好。在毛泽东思想哺育下，我们贫下中农是坚定的无产阶级革命派。在农业集体化的道路上，困难难不倒我们贫下中农；阶级敌人的破坏，吓不倒我们贫下中农；资产阶级反动路线的迫害，压不垮我们贫下中农。我们贫下中农，因为苦大仇深，又用毛泽东思想武装了头脑，所以最革命，最拥护社会主义。
    毛主席说：“乡村中一向苦战奋斗的主要力量是贫农。”“贫农对于合作化最积极。”这是伟大领袖毛主席对我们贫下中农的最大信任，最大支持。毛主席为我们撑腰，我们为毛主席争气。我们要永远忠于毛主席，永远忠于伟大的毛泽东思想，永远忠于毛主席的革命路线，狠批中国赫鲁晓夫的资产阶级反动路线，办好人民公社，加强无产阶级专政，保证社会主义江山不变颜色。
