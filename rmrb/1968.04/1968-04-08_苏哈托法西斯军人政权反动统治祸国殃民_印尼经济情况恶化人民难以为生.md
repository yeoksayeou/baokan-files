Under the fascist military regime of Suharto-Nasution, the economic situation in Indonesia is worsening. Food is scarce, inflation is rampant, prices are soaring, unemployment is rising, famine is severe, and the people are suffering immensely.

Currently, imperialist countries are dumping their goods in the Indonesian market, severely impacting Indonesian national industries. Many factories have outdated machinery, lack parts, funds, and equipment, and are closing down. The fascist military regime's mouthpiece, the Antara News Agency, revealed that in 1967, industrial production was only at 20-30% capacity. Just in Jakarta, since May of last year, 5,000 businesses have shut down. According to other reports, many small textile enterprises in Central Java have closed; in West Java, only 30% of textile enterprises are barely maintaining production. Mining production has also significantly decreased. According to the Indonesian newspaper *Pemberontak*, coal production has been declining year by year, with 590,000 tons in 1965, 319,000 tons in 1966, and only 191,500 tons by November 1967.

In agricultural production, Suharto, the head of the fascist military regime, admitted at a meeting at the end of last year that the rice yield in 1967 only reached 80.7% of the planned target. According to other reports, the rice yield in the 1967 dry season was 20% less than the previous year.

Due to the sharp decline in industrial and agricultural production, export earnings have significantly decreased. According to figures from the Central Statistics Bureau of the Indonesian fascist regime, in the first nine months of last year compared to the same period the previous year, earnings from exports of rubber, coconut, tobacco, tea, and coconut oil decreased by $69 million, with the main export commodity, rubber, decreasing by $37 million. Since January of this year, export earnings have further decreased.

The domestic fiscal situation has a huge deficit. In mid-February, Hamengku Buwono, the Minister of Economy, Finance, and Industry of the Indonesian fascist military regime, admitted that the fiscal deficit in 1967 reached 51.29 billion rupiah.

To maintain the enormous military expenses and administrative costs needed for their military dictatorship, and to fill the pockets of a large number of reactionary officers and bureaucrats, the Indonesian fascist military regime continuously increases various taxes. According to the budget, this year's tax target is 500 billion rupiah, double last year's amount, accounting for 43% of the total budget revenue. At the same time, inflation is rampant. The Minister of Finance, Seda, revealed that by mid-February, the currency in circulation had reached over 520 billion rupiah, while in January last year, it was only 200 billion rupiah. Due to inflation, the value of the Indonesian rupiah in people's minds has decreased, and people refer to Indonesian banknotes as "worthless dirty paper."

Due to the decline in industrial and agricultural production and inflation, prices in Indonesia have been soaring for a long time. According to reports, after the spring of 1968, the already high rice prices continued to rise. In January, the price of rice in Jakarta increased from 23 rupiah per kilogram last year to 50 rupiah. Prices in other places are even higher.

According to Western news agencies, in the first week after New Year's Day, the prices of nine major commodities increased by more than 11%, while the prices of flour, eggs, soybeans, and sugar doubled compared to the beginning of last month.

Currently, the entire country presents a tragic scene of hunger. Many hungry people survive on cassava leaves and banana stems. Hunger and edema are spreading, and the number of people dying from hunger is increasing. According to Agence France-Presse, by January 15, 280 people had starved to death in two regions of South Sumatra. Many hungry people, with their children, flee to escape the famine. Many abandon their children or sell their daughters, and some place their children on bamboo rafts to drift away with the rivers.

Due to economic decline, the number of unemployed in cities is increasing. The Indonesian government revealed that last year, the number of unemployed and semi-unemployed people nationwide was approximately 18 million.

    苏哈托法西斯军人政权反动统治祸国殃民
    印尼经济情况恶化人民难以为生
    据新华社讯　本社记者报道，在苏哈托—纳苏蒂安法西斯军人政权统治下的印度尼西亚，经济情况越来越糟，粮食奇缺，通货膨胀，物价飞涨，失业人口剧增，饥荒严重，人民处在水深火热之中。
    目前，帝国主义国家的商品在印尼市场大量倾销，印尼民族工业遭受严重打击，加上不少工厂机器破旧，缺乏零件、资金和设备，纷纷倒闭。法西斯军人政权的喉舌安塔拉通讯社透露，一九六七年工业生产开工率只在百分之二十至三十之间。仅雅加达市，去年五月份以来就有五千家企业关门。另据报道，中爪哇纺织工业中很多小型企业关门；在西爪哇，只有百分之三十的纺织企业勉强维持生产。矿业生产也大幅度减产。据印尼《战斗报》透露，煤的产量逐年下降，一九六五年是五十九万吨，一九六六年降为三十一万九千吨，一九六七年十一月统计，只完成十九万一千五百吨。
    在农业生产方面，法西斯军人政权头目苏哈托在去年年底一次集会上供认，一九六七年稻谷产量只完成预计指标的百分之八十点七。另据报道，一九六七年旱季大米产量比上一年减产百分之二十。
    由于工农业生产急剧下降，出口收入大大减少。据印尼法西斯政权中央统计局透露的数字，去年头九个月同前年同期比较，橡胶、椰子、烟叶、茶叶和椰油的出口收入减少六千九百万美元，其中主要出口货物橡胶的出口收入减少三千七百万美元。今年一月以来，出口收入更加减少。
    国内财政出现庞大的赤字。印尼法西斯军人政权经济、财政和工业国务部长哈孟库·布沃诺二月中旬承认，一九六七年财政赤字达到五十一亿二千九百万盾。
    印尼法西斯军人政权为了维持其军事独裁统治所需的浩大的军费和行政开支，为了填饱大批反动军官和官僚的私囊，不断增加苛捐杂税。根据预算，今年税收指标为五百亿盾，比去年增加一倍，占预算总收入的百分之四十三。与此同时，通货不断膨胀。法西斯军人政权财政部长塞达透露，二月中旬，市面流通的货币已增到五百二十亿盾以上，而去年一月份流通的货币只有二百亿盾。由于通货膨胀，印尼盾在人们心目中的信用降低，人们把印尼钞票说成是“没有多大价值的一张肮脏的纸”。
    由于工农业减产，通货膨胀，长期以来，印尼的物价有如脱缰之马，一个劲地飞涨。据报道，一九六八年入春后，已经高昂的米价仍在节节上涨。今年一月，雅加达大米价格由去年每公斤二十三盾上涨到五十盾。其他地方米价更高。
    据西方通讯社报道，今年元旦后头一周里，九种主要商品的价格提高百分之十一多，而面粉、鸡蛋、大豆和食糖的价格比上月初涨了一倍。
    目前，印尼全国各地呈现一片饥饿的悲惨景象。许多饥民以木薯叶、香蕉茎充饥，饥饿、水肿病蔓延，饿死的人越来越多。据法新社报道，截至一月十五日，南苏门答腊的两个地区就饿死二百八十人。不少饥民携儿带女，出外逃荒。不少饥民弃儿卖女，有的把孩子放到竹排上，随江河漂流而去。
    由于经济凋敝，城市失业人数增加。印尼官方透露，去年全国失业和半失业人数约达一千八百万。
