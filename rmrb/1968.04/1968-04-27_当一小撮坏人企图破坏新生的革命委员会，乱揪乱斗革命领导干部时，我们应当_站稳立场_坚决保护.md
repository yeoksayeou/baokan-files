	When a few bad elements attempt to sabotage the new revolutionary committee and arbitrarily criticize revolutionary cadres, we must—

	Stand firm and protect

	Chairman Mao teaches us: “Correctly handling cadres is the key to implementing the revolutionary three-in-one combination, consolidating the revolutionary great alliance, and doing a good job in the struggle, criticism, and transformation of the unit. This issue must be resolved.” Currently, a few bad elements are deceiving and inciting some masses, seizing on certain past mistakes of some revolutionary cadres, attacking one point and ignoring the rest, arbitrarily criticizing and fighting, attempting to shake and sabotage the new revolutionary government. Faced with this situation, we must stand firm and resolutely protect revolutionary cadres.

	Not long ago, a few class enemies in our county used the anarchist trends and bourgeois factionalism of some masses to deceive and manipulate them to attack the former public security committee secretary Cai Weiling. They claimed they were about to take “revolutionary action.” After studying the situation, we concluded that Comrade Cai Weiling’s history over more than ten years is revolutionary and loyal to Chairman Mao. Although he made some mistakes during the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, he has made a profound self-criticism among the masses, and his corrections have been relatively good. Since joining the revolutionary committee, his performance has been even more outstanding, and he has gained the trust of the broad masses. For such a revolutionary cadre, dare we not resolutely protect him? This is a question of loyalty to Chairman Mao’s proletarian revolutionary line and cadre policy. This is a class struggle and must be treated seriously. We decided: resolutely protect Comrade Cai Weiling and absolutely not allow class enemies to arbitrarily criticize and fight revolutionary cadres, shaking the new revolutionary committee.

	Thus, we propagated Chairman Mao’s cadre policy to the masses who came to attack and expressed our firm stance of resolutely protecting Comrade Cai Weiling. The deceived masses received education, and many turned back to expose the culprits behind the scenes. By doing this, we not only educated the masses but also supported and encouraged Comrade Cai Weiling. He expressed his determination to better study and apply Chairman Mao Zedong Thought, put politics in command, go deep among the masses, and do a good job, creating new merits for the people.

    当一小撮坏人企图破坏新生的革命委员会，乱揪乱斗革命领导干部时，我们应当——
    站稳立场  坚决保护
    郑伟峰
    毛主席教导我们：“正确地对待干部，是实行革命三结合，巩固革命大联合，搞好本单位斗、批、改的关键问题，一定要解决好。”目前，有一小撮坏人竟然蒙蔽和挑动一部分群众，抓住有的革命领导干部过去的某些错误，攻其一点，不及其余，乱揪乱斗，企图动摇和破坏新生的革命政权。面对这种情况，我们必须站稳立场，坚决保护革命的领导干部。
    不久以前，我县一小撮阶级敌人利用部分群众的无政府主义思潮和资产阶级派性，蒙蔽和操纵他们围攻原监委书记蔡为令同志。他们扬言就要采取“革命行动”。我们研究后认为，蔡为令同志十多年的历史是革命的，是忠于毛主席的，虽然在无产阶级文化大革命中犯了一些错误，但已在群众中做了深刻检查，而且改正得较好。参加革命委员会以来，表现更为突出，已经得到广大群众的信任。对于这样的革命干部，敢不敢坚决地保护，是忠不忠于毛主席的无产阶级革命路线和干部政策的问题。这是一场阶级斗争，必须严肃对待。我们决定：坚决保护蔡为令同志，绝不能让阶级敌人乱揪乱斗革命的领导干部，动摇新生的革命委员会。
    于是，我们对那些来冲击的群众宣传毛主席的干部政策，并表明我们坚决保护蔡为令同志的坚定立场。受蒙蔽的群众受到教育，纷纷大杀回马枪，揪出了幕后的坏人。我们这样做，既教育了群众，又支持和鼓舞了蔡为令同志。他表示，要更好地活学活用毛泽东思想，政治挂帅，深入群众，做好工作，为人民立新功。
