A batch of revolutionary cadres at Anshan Iron and Steel's Gōngchánglíng Iron Mine firmly stand on Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, correctly handle relations with the masses, stand the test in class struggle, persist in correct leadership, and establish a fish-water-like relationship with the masses.

They are willing to be the students of the masses, studying, working, and fighting against selfishness and revisionism together with the masses. Both their revolution and production are outstanding.

New China News Agency, Anshan: A batch of revolutionary cadres at Anshan Iron and Steel Company's Gōngchánglíng Iron Mine, during the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, followed the great leader Chairman Mao's instruction, "You must put politics in command, go among the masses, and together with the masses, make the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution even better." They breathed the same breath and shared the same fate with the broad revolutionary masses, studied Chairman Mao's works together, fought against selfishness and revisionism together, and performed new deeds for the people. The people affectionately call them "good cadres of Chairman Mao" and "our good leaders." Now, most of these cadres who have stood the test of struggle have been elected into various levels of the three-in-one revolutionary committees.

Correctly Handling Relations with the Masses and Oneself, Standing the Test in the Storm of Mass Struggle

The batch of revolutionary cadres at Gōngchánglíng Iron Mine includes the former Party Committee Secretary, Deputy Secretary, Deputy Mine Director, and the Branch Secretaries and Section Chiefs of various workshops. Most of them were the first or second in command. In the initial stage of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, they had implemented a bourgeois reactionary line for a period, made mistakes, and were criticized by the broad revolutionary masses. However, they were able to correctly handle relations with the masses and with themselves using Mao Zedong Thought. They bravely admitted their mistakes, drew a clear line between themselves and the bourgeois reactionary line, and firmly stood on Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. Therefore, they quickly gained the trust and understanding of the masses.

Former Mine Party Committee Secretary Jiá Dé Cái was initially unable to accept criticism from the masses. Later, he studied Chairman Mao's works repeatedly with his problems in mind and recalled his bitter life in the old society. He thought, it was the great leader Chairman Mao who saved him from the bitter sea of the old society and nurtured a poor, illiterate child into a Party cadre. However, at the crucial moment of the decisive battle between the two classes, the two roads, and the two lines, he went against Chairman Mao's teachings and implemented the bourgeois reactionary line, which made him feel very painful. After recognizing his mistakes, he made up his mind to overcome various selfish thoughts, replace the "fear" with "dare," and replace the "self" with "public." He went to the mass struggle to face the wind and rain, accept criticism from the masses. From then on, whenever the masses wanted him to inspect, he would go, and he would sincerely expose his selfish thoughts and actively seek opinions from the mining areas, shifts, and workers' homes. The more he inspected, the more he felt his mistakes were serious, and the more he felt the masses were caring for him, helping him, and saving him. In March of last year, at the mine-wide workers' meeting, he made his fifth inspection. Some people with ulterior motives wanted to strike him down, but many old workers stood up and said, "We trust revolutionary cadres like Secretary Jiá." In this way, with the support of the vast majority of revolutionary masses, he stood up.

Political Department Director Wáng Sì Fā, in the initial stage of the movement, served as the team leader of the middle school work team in the mining area and also implemented the bourgeois reactionary line. Like Jiá Dé Cái, in addition to making deep inspections at various large and small meetings, he also brought the work team members to visit every household to seek opinions, apologize to revolutionary teachers and students who were persecuted during his implementation of the bourgeois reactionary line. He went to places where he had the most criticisms to inspect his mistakes and accept criticisms, finally gaining the understanding of the masses. At the meeting where Jiá Dé Cái was liberated, many revolutionary teachers and students who had been persecuted by him handed in notes, requesting that Wáng Sī Fā also stand up, which moved Wáng Sī Fā to tears. He said, "Today's facts once again prove that the proletarian revolutionary faction's attack on me was to wash away my mistakes and save me from the mire of the bourgeois reactionary line. Only by relying on the masses and believing in the masses can one truly liberate oneself."

Eliminating Officialdom, Going Deep Among the Masses, and Being Good Students of the Masses

The great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "To solve the problem of the relationship between superiors and subordinates well, and to handle the relationship between cadres and the masses well. In the future, cadres should go down to the lower levels to walk around and see for themselves. They should adhere to the mass line, consult with the masses more on matters, and be students of the masses." Chairman Mao's teachings further pointed the way for the revolutionary cadres at Gōngchánglíng Iron Mine. After standing up, they seriously drew lessons from their past mistakes of making errors, maintained broad, frequent, and close contact with the broad worker masses in class struggle and production struggle, transformed themselves in actual struggle, were students of the masses, and at the same time, took the lead in revolution and production.

After this batch of cadres stood up, in the fierce class struggle of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, they always fought side by side with the revolutionary factions. In the first half of last year, when a handful of capitalist roaders in Anshan Municipal Committee and Anshan Iron and Steel Company were unwilling to perish and launched a fierce counterattack against the revolutionary factions, this batch of revolutionary cadres all insisted on fighting on the front line, coming up with ideas, finding ways, and sharing the same breath and fate with the broad revolutionary masses, establishing a deep combat friendship.

In the past few months, with the victory of the revolutionary situation, the revolutionary order of the mine has been established. However, this batch of revolutionary cadres still spend two-thirds of their time living among the masses. Former Party Committee Secretary Jiá Dé Cái, Deputy Secretary Wú Shù Gāng, Political Department Director Wáng Sī Fā, and others have walked through every mining area, shaft, and workshop in the mine. Wherever there are difficulties, they appear there. Sometimes they even move their luggage to the workers' dormitories, eating, living, and working with everyone, fighting against selfishness and revisionism together, and studying and applying Chairman Mao's works together. For a period, the selected concentrate powder in the mine's beneficiation plant could not be transported out in time, hindering the normal progress of production. All revolutionary workers were very anxious. Facing this situation, former Party Committee Secretary Jiá Dé Cái and Deputy Secretary Wú Shù Gāng, and other revolutionary cadres stood on the production front line, leading the workers to study and apply Mao Zedong Thought, emphasizing the importance of grasping revolution and promoting production and self-reliance in overcoming difficulties, mobilizing everyone to find tricks and ways; and personally participating in labor under the scorching sun, sweating profusely with everyone to build up mineral reserves. Therefore, they ensured the completion of various tasks month after month, and the output of iron concentrate also created the highest record in history.

Jiá Dé Cái and other revolutionary cadres humbled themselves to be students of the masses, struggled and lived with the masses, and received praise from the broad revolutionary masses. The workers affectionately called them political leaders, confidants in thought, and intimate friends in life. The workers were very close to these cadres, and these cadres also felt that a few days without contact with the masses was like a fish out of water, losing their support. They deeply felt that the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution was indeed a great revolution that touched people's souls. In the past, although we also said we should follow the mass line and be good servants of the people, we did not understand it deeply and did not implement it well, and in the end, we still deviated from the masses and made mistakes. Only by truly following Chairman Mao's teachings, humbling ourselves, and always being students of the masses, and by tempering and transforming ourselves, can we prevent the emergence of bureaucratism and revisionism and forever maintain revolutionary youthfulness.

"Dare" at the Forefront, Persisting in Correct Leadership, and Arm the Masses with Mao Zedong Thought

"Dare" at the forefront, persisting in leading the revolution and production correctly with Mao Zedong Thought, is another manifestation of this batch of revolutionary cadres performing new deeds in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. They believe that cadres standing up for the revolution must follow the requirements of the "Sixteen Points," with "dare" at the forefront, mobilize the masses, and lead correctly with Mao Zedong Thought, instead of shrinking back and hiding on the side. Only in this way can the role of revolutionary cadres be fully played, and the expectations of the revolutionary masses not be disappointed.

The batch of revolutionary cadres at Gōngchánglíng Iron Mine also believe that persisting in correct leadership is most importantly to first study and apply Mao Zedong Thought well, persist in Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, follow Chairman Mao's strategic deployment, grasp the direction of the struggle, and lead the revolutionary masses to advance to victory along the course pointed out by Chairman Mao.

Since the beginning of last year, whenever the great leader Chairman Mao and the proletarian headquarters headed by Chairman Mao issued calls and instructions, they would act immediately, take the lead in studying, deeply understand, and quickly convey and propagate to all employees and their families. They would also work with the responsible persons of various revolutionary mass organizations and cadres at all levels to seriously study and formulate measures for implementation. In June last year, after the great leader Chairman Mao's important documents such as "Bombard the Headquarters" were published, under the initiative of this batch of revolutionary cadres and the help of the PLA stationed in Anshan Iron and Steel, the revolutionary mass organizations in Gōngchánglíng set up various types of study classes, seriously studied these documents, deeply understood the great leader Chairman Mao's theories, lines, and policies on the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, analyzed the situation, and grasped the direction. Therefore, although the class struggle in Anshan area was very sharp and complex at that time, the broad revolutionary masses in this mine could grasp the direction of the struggle and pay attention to using different methods to handle different types of contradictions.

After the great leader Chairman Mao's latest instructions on the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution were issued, this batch of revolutionary cadres regarded them as treasures, immediately propagated and explained to the broad revolutionary masses, and helped the revolutionary mass organizations to set up Mao Zedong Thought study classes, seriously implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions. As a result, in a short period of time, from the mining area, workshops, streets, collective dormitories to the workers' families, Mao Zedong Thought study classes were set up everywhere, and a hot tide of seriously studying and comprehensively implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions surged, which greatly promoted the thought revolutionization of cadres and workers, promoted the great alliance of revolution and the three-in-one combination of revolution.

The batch of revolutionary cadres at Gōngchánglíng Iron Mine dared to take the lead, persisted in Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, and set a good example for all revolutionary cadres in the mining area. Under their influence, now more than 95% of the cadres in the entire mine have stood up, bravely shouldered the double burden of revolution and production, and established a fish-water-like relationship with the masses. Production is also booming. Last year, the entire mining area completed the production tasks excellently, and this year's production tasks in the entire mining area have also been completed well. Many mining areas and workshops have created new records.

    鞍钢弓长岭铁矿一批革命领导干部坚决站到毛主席的革命路线上
    正确对待群众　在阶级斗争中经受考验
    坚持正确领导　和群众建立鱼水般关系
    他们甘当群众的小学生，和群众一起学习、劳动、斗私批修，革命和生产都很出色
    新华社鞍山电　鞍山钢铁公司弓长岭铁矿的一批革命领导干部，在无产阶级文化大革命中，遵循伟大领袖毛主席“你们要政治挂帅，到群众里面去，和群众在一起，把无产阶级文化大革命搞得更好”的教导，和广大革命群众同呼吸、共命运，一起活学活用毛主席著作，一起斗私批修，为人民立了新功。人们亲切地称他们是“毛主席的好干部”、“我们的好打头的”。现在，这些经受了斗争考验的干部绝大多数已经被选进各级三结合的临时权力机构。
      正确对待群众，正确对待自己，在
  群众斗争的大风浪中经受考验
    弓长岭铁矿的这批革命领导干部，有原党委书记、副书记、副矿长和各车间的总支书记、车间主任等，绝大多数是第一把手或第二把手。在无产阶级文化大革命运动初期，他们曾经执行过一段资产阶级反动路线，犯了错误，受到了广大革命群众的冲击。但是，他们能够用毛泽东思想正确地对待群众，正确地对待自己，大胆承认错误，划清同资产阶级反动路线的界限，坚决站到毛主席的无产阶级革命路线一边，因而很快就得到了群众的信任和谅解。
    原矿党委书记贾德才开始受群众批判时，思想不通。后来，他带着自己的问题反复学习了毛主席著作，并且回想了自己在旧社会的苦难生活。他想到，是伟大领袖毛主席把自己从旧社会的苦海中救了出来，把一个不识字的穷孩子培养成了党的干部，可是在两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的决战时刻，自己却违背了毛主席的教导，执行了资产阶级反动路线，心里感到很难受。他认识了自己的错误以后，就下定决心克服各种私心杂念，把“怕”字换成“敢”字，把“私”字换成“公”字，到群众斗争中去经风雨、见世面，接受群众的批评。从此以后，群众什么时候要他去检查，他就什么时候去，而且态度诚恳，能够大胆亮出自己的私心杂念，还主动到采区、班组和职工家里去广泛征求意见。这样，他越检查越觉得自己的错误严重，越检查越觉得群众是在关心自己，帮助自己，挽救自己。去年三月，他在全矿职工大会上作第五次检查，个别别有用心的人想打击他，很多老工人却挺身而出说：“象贾书记这样的革命干部，我们信得过。”就这样，在绝大多数革命群众的支持下，他站了出来。
    政治部主任王四发，在运动初期担任了矿区中学工作队的队长，也执行了资产阶级反动路线。他和贾德才一样，除了在各种大小会议上作了深刻的检查以外，还带了工作队员，挨家挨户征求意见，向在他执行资产阶级反动路线期间受到打击的革命师生赔礼道歉，那里对他意见最多，他就到那里去检查错误、接受批评，终于取得了群众的谅解。就在解放贾德才的那次大会上，许多原来受过他打击的革命师生纷纷递条子，要求同时让王四发站出来，感动得王四发热泪盈眶。他说：“今天的事实再一次证明，无产阶级革命派冲击我，是为了冲掉我的错误，把我从资产阶级反动路线的泥坑中挽救出来。只有依靠群众，相信群众，才能够彻底解放自己。”
  打掉官气，深入群众，当好群众的小学生
    伟大领袖毛主席教导我们说：“要很好地解决上下级关系问题，搞好干部和群众的关系。以后干部要分别到下面去走一走，看一看，要坚持群众路线，遇事多和群众商量，做群众的小学生。”毛主席的教导，为弓长岭铁矿的革命领导干部进一步指明了方向。他们在站出来后，认真吸取了过去犯错误的教训，在阶级斗争和生产斗争的实践中，同广大工人群众一直保持了广泛的、经常的、密切的联系，在实际斗争中改造自己，当群众的小学生，同时取得革命和生产的领导权。
    这一批干部站出来后，在无产阶级文化大革命的激烈阶级搏斗中，始终和革命派并肩战斗。去年上半年当鞍山市委和鞍钢公司内一小撮走资派不甘心自己的灭亡，向革命派进行疯狂反扑的时刻，这批革命领导干部都坚持斗争在第一线，出主意，想办法，和广大革命群众同呼吸共命运，建立了十分深厚的战斗友谊。
    最近几个月来，随着革命形势的胜利发展，矿山的革命秩序已经建立，但是这批革命领导干部仍然有三分之二的时间生活在群众之中。原党委书记贾德才、副书记吴树刚、政治部主任王四发等，更是走遍矿山的每一个采区、坑道和车间，那里有困难，就出现在那里。有时他们还把行李搬到工人宿舍，和大家同吃、同住、同劳动，一起斗私批修，一起活学活用毛主席著作。有一个时期，矿山选矿厂选出的精矿粉不能及时运出去，妨碍着生产的正常进行。广大革命职工都很着急。面对这一情况，原党委书记贾德才，副书记吴树刚等革命领导干部，就站在生产第一线，一面带领职工活学活用毛泽东思想，大讲抓革命、促生产和自力更生、克服困难的重要意义，发动大家找窍门，想办法；一面在盛暑烈日之下亲自参加劳动，汗流浃背地和大家一起大搞矿石储备，因此保证了月月超额完成各项任务，铁精矿的产量还创造了历史上最高纪录。
    贾德才等革命领导干部放下架子甘当群众的小学生，同群众一起斗争、生活，受到了广大革命群众的赞扬，群众热情地称他们是自己政治上的带头人，思想上的知心人，生活上的贴心人。工人们同这些领导干部亲密无间，这些干部也感到，几天不接触群众，就象鱼儿离开水一样，失去了依靠。他们深有体会地说：无产阶级文化大革命，真是一场触及人们灵魂的大革命。过去我们虽然也说要走群众路线，当好人民的勤务员，但总是理解不深，执行不好，最后还是脱离群众，犯错误。真正按照毛主席的教导，放下架子，永远当群众的小学生，加紧锻炼和改造自己，才能防止产生官僚主义和修正主义，永葆革命的青春。
      “敢”字当头，坚持正确领导，用
  毛泽东思想去武装群众
    “敢”字当头，坚持用毛泽东思想正确领导革命和生产，是这批革命领导干部在无产阶级文化大革命中立新功的又一表现。他们认为，干部站出来革命，必须按照“十六条”的要求，“敢”字当头，放手发动群众，用毛泽东思想坚持正确领导，而不是缩手缩脚，躲在一旁。这样，才能充分发挥革命领导干部的作用，不辜负革命群众对自己的期望。
    弓长岭铁矿的这批革命领导干部还认为，坚持正确的领导，最最重要的是自己必须首先学好用好毛泽东思想，坚持毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，紧跟毛主席的战略部署，掌握斗争大方向，带领革命群众沿着毛主席指引的航向胜利前进。
    从去年年初以来，凡是伟大领袖毛主席和以毛主席为首的无产阶级司令部发出的号召、指示，他们都是闻风而动，带头学习，深刻领会，以最快的速度向全体职工和家属进行传达、宣传，并且同各革命群众组织的负责人、各级干部一起认真研究和制定贯彻落实的措施。去年六月，当伟大领袖毛主席《炮打司令部》等一系列重要文献发表后，在这批革命领导干部的倡导和驻鞍钢解放军的帮助下，弓长岭的革命群众组织办起了各种类型的学习班，认真学习这些文件，深刻领会伟大领袖毛主席关于无产阶级文化大革命的理论、路线和方针、政策，分析形势，掌握航向。因而尽管当时鞍山地区的阶级斗争十分尖锐复杂，这个矿的广大革命群众都能掌握斗争的大方向，注意用不同的方法去处理不同性质的矛盾。
    伟大领袖毛主席关于无产阶级文化大革命的最新指示下达以后，这批革命领导干部更如获至宝，立即向广大革命群众进行宣传、讲解，并且帮助革命群众组织大办毛泽东思想学习班，认真落实毛主席的最新指示。结果，在很短的时间内，从矿区、车间、街道、集体宿舍直到职工家庭，都办起了毛泽东思想学习班，到处掀起了认真学习和全面落实毛主席最新指示的热潮，有力地促进了干部和职工的思想革命化，推动了革命的大联合和革命的三结合。
    弓长岭铁矿这批革命领导干部“敢”字当头，坚持毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，为矿区全体革命干部树立了良好的榜样。在他们的影响下，现在全矿已有百分之九十五以上的干部站了出来，勇敢地挑起了革命和生产两副重担，并且和群众建立了鱼水般的关系。生产也是蒸蒸日上。去年全矿区出色地完成了生产任务，今年全矿区的生产任务也完成得很好，许多采区和车间还创造了新纪录。
