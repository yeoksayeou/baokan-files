I am the mother of the good soldier of Chairman Mao, Liu Yingjun. After hearing the joint editorial of the *People's Daily*, *Red Flag* magazine, and *Liberation Army Daily*, "The Revolutionary Committee is Good," I was extremely moved.

I was born into a poor peasant family and suffered tremendously under the oppression and exploitation of landlords in the old, evil society. I couldn't eat or dress properly, truly worse off than cattle and horses. It was our great leader Chairman Mao who saved us poor and lower-middle peasants from the depths of misery, distributing land and houses to us, making us masters of the state. Not long ago, when the Revolutionary Committee of Jilin Province was established, the people of the entire province elected me as a member of the Revolutionary Committee. Thinking of the past and looking at the present, how could I not be moved? I can't express my boundless love for Chairman Mao even if I shout "Long live Chairman Mao!" a thousand times, ten thousand times. I can't express my boundless admiration for Chairman Mao even if I sing "The East is Red" and "Sailing the Seas Depends on the Helmsman" a thousand times, ten thousand times. Dear Chairman Mao! I promise you: I will always listen to your words, act according to your teachings, and hold power and use power for the proletariat properly and well.

How can we hold power and use power properly? Recently, I participated in the activities commemorating the second anniversary of the martyrdom of my son's unit. I clearly saw that the fundamental reason for the rapid growth of heroes like Ouyang Hai, Liu Yingjun, Cai Yongxiang, and Li Wenzhong is that they actively study and apply Chairman Mao's works, promoting the revolutionization of thought. They seriously read Chairman Mao's books and focus on the "application" of his teachings, breaking away from selfishness and establishing public-mindedness, arming themselves with Mao Zedong Thought, and truly becoming infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao. I think: The Revolutionary Committee of the province should hold power and use power properly for the people of the entire province by promoting the revolutionization of thought. That is to say, we should be like the heroic soldiers Ouyang Hai, Liu Yingjun, Cai Yongxiang, and Li Wenzhong, actively studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, and constantly breaking away from selfishness and establishing public-mindedness. Although I was born into a poor peasant family, I am an old society person with many old thoughts and many selfish ideas. In the past two years, I have seriously studied Chairman Mao's works and achieved some results, but I am still far from Chairman Mao's requirements. I will definitely follow the instructions of Vice Chairman Lin, treating myself as a force for the revolution and at the same time treating myself as an object of the revolution, constantly fighting against selfishness and criticizing revisionism, and reforming my thoughts. I will work with other committee members to strive to build the Revolutionary Committee of the province into a revolutionary leadership team that is armed with Mao Zedong Thought, closely connected with the masses, and a model for studying, faithfully executing, enthusiastically propagating, and bravely defending Mao Zedong Thought.

To hold power and use power properly, we must not, even for a moment, detach ourselves from the masses. Chairman Mao teaches us: "We Communists are not seeking office but seeking revolution. We must have a thorough spirit of revolution. We must not, even for a moment, detach ourselves from the masses. As long as we do not detach ourselves from the masses, we will surely be victorious." Chairman Mao's teachings are so profound! I will definitely keep them in mind and put them into action. Now, although I am a member of the Revolutionary Committee of the province, I will not be high and mighty or act like an official. Instead, I will be a diligent servant of the people. I will never forget that I am an ordinary poor peasant. I will, as in the past, labor, fight, and live with the poor and lower-middle peasants. Only in this way can I become a good servant of the people and truly serve the people wholeheartedly.

    用毛泽东思想掌好权用好权
    吉林省革命委员会委员　朱秀兰
    我是毛主席的好战士刘英俊的母亲。我从收音机里听到《人民日报》、《红旗》杂志、《解放军报》的社论《革命委员会好》以后，心情非常激动。
    我出身在一个贫农的家庭，在万恶的旧社会受尽了地主的剥削和压迫，吃不上，穿不上，真是牛马不如。是我们伟大领袖毛主席，把我们贫下中农从水深火热中解救出来了，分了田地和房屋，成了国家的主人。不久以前，吉林省革命委员会成立的时候，全省人民又推选我当了革命委员会委员。想想过去，看看现在，叫我怎么能不激动呢？我一千遍一万遍地欢呼“毛主席万岁！”也表达不完我对毛主席的无限热爱。我一千遍一万遍地高唱《东方红》和《大海航行靠舵手》，也表达不完我对毛主席的无限崇拜。敬爱的毛主席啊！我向您老人家保证：永远听您的话，照您的教导办事，为无产阶级掌好权，用好权。
    怎样才能掌好权，用好权呢？最近，我参加了英俊生前所在连队纪念英俊牺牲两周年的活动。我清楚地看到，象欧阳海、刘英俊、蔡永祥、李文忠这些英雄战士迅速成长的根本原因，就是活学活用毛主席著作，促进思想革命化。他们认真读毛主席的书，在“用”字上狠下功夫，破私立公，用毛泽东思想武装自己，真正做到了无限忠于毛主席。我想：省革命委员会要为全省人民掌好权，用好权，就得搞好思想革命化。也就是要象欧阳海、刘英俊、蔡永祥、李文忠等英雄战士那样，活学活用毛主席著作，不断地破私立公。我虽然是出身在贫农家庭，但我是个旧社会过来的人，还有不少旧的思想意识，还有不少私心杂念，这两年认真学习毛主席著作，取得了一定的成绩，但离毛主席的要求还差得很远。我一定按照林副主席的指示，把自己当作革命的一份力量，同时又把自己当作革命的对象，不断地斗私批修，改造自己的思想。我要和其他委员一道，努力把省革命委员会建设成为一个用毛泽东思想武装起来的革命化的密切联系群众的领导班子，使革命委员会成为努力学习毛泽东思想，忠实执行毛泽东思想，热情宣传毛泽东思想，勇敢捍卫毛泽东思想的模范。
    要掌好权，用好权，就要一时一刻也不脱离群众。毛主席教导我们：“我们共产党人不是要做官，而是要革命，我们人人要有彻底的革命精神，我们不要有一时一刻脱离群众。只要我们不脱离群众，我们就一定会胜利。”毛主席的教导是多么深刻呵！我一定永远铭刻在心上，落实在行动上。现在，我虽然是省革命委员会的委员，但我绝不高高在上，绝不做官当老爷，而是要做一个人民的勤务员。我永远不忘我是一个普通的贫农社员，我要和过去一样，跟贫下中农劳动在一起，战斗在一起，生活在一起。只有这样，才能成为人民的好勤务员，真正做到全心全意为人民服务。
