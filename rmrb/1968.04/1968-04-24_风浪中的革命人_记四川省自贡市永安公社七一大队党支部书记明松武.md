The Party Branch Secretary of Seven-One Production Brigade, Yong'an People's Commune, Zigong City, Sichuan Province, and veteran poor peasant, Ming Songwu, is praised by the masses as a "revolutionary amidst stormy waves." This cadre, who has worked at the grassroots level in rural areas for over a decade, has, during the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, bravely advanced amidst the great waves of mass struggle, forging himself to be more solid and mature. Advancing Amidst Stormy Waves

Last winter, when the flames of the Cultural Revolution spread to the rural areas of Zigong City, Ming Songwu, with boundless loyalty to the great leader Chairman Mao, threw himself into the movement. He diligently studied the "Sixteen Points," believing that the word "fear" should be replaced with "dare," encouraging and supporting revolutionary masses to rise up and fiercely attack the handful of capitalist roaders within the Party. At the same time, he also helped cadres correct their mistakes and shortcomings. At that time, during the initial phase of the movement, the commune members had not yet been mobilized. He repeatedly went to Yong'an Middle School to invite the Red Guards to come to the commune to start the fire. He said, "This is inviting the revolutionary youngsters to help catch the ghosts and snakes, and burn away the dirt on our own bodies."

The masses rose up, and the fire was ignited. The fierce momentum of the movement, however, put some pressure on him. Additionally, his family members did not fully understand the movement and held him back, causing him to feel a bit afraid. As soon as this thought flashed through his mind, he remembered Chairman Mao's teachings: "Those who talk about 'arousing the masses' every day but are afraid to death when the masses rise up are no different from the story of Leigong loving dragons!" These words struck him to the core, and he realized: A Communist Party member must not be a disgraceful deserter in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. Thus, he actively participated in the large and small meetings convened by the commune members, listened to the criticisms of the masses, and never missed a session.

On the wall of Ming Songwu's home, there are three big-character posters written by the masses. These were brought back from outside and posted on the wall by him in February of last year. Some commune members saw the posters and told him, "Just tear them down." He said, "I can't tear them down because they expose my shortcomings. They should be posted for a few more days to constantly remind myself."

To better gain the help and supervision of the masses, one must dare to "expose one's private thoughts." Initially, Ming Songwu had reservations. He feared that if he revealed things that others had never known about, and exposed "private" matters that others had not noticed, the masses would seize on these minor issues and criticize him more harshly. He feared that the rebels would not understand him, and the higher-ups would not believe him. He feared that in the future, the masses would not listen to him, and he would lose his "authority." Thus, the thoughts of "exposing" and "hiding" his private thoughts fiercely clashed in his mind.

He repeatedly studied Chairman Mao's teachings: "Countless revolutionary martyrs sacrificed their lives for the people's interests, making every living person feel sad when thinking of them. Can we still have personal interests that we cannot sacrifice, and errors that we cannot abandon?" He questioned himself: Revolutionary martyrs dedicated everything they had to the revolutionary cause without reservation. Yet, I want to lock my "private" thoughts in a "confidential cabinet." Can this be justified to the revolutionary martyrs? Can this be justified to Chairman Mao and the expectations of the revolutionary masses? After a fierce struggle within himself, he resolutely exposed his various private thoughts to the commune members. Some commune members said he was "lifting a stone to drop on his own feet." He seriously and earnestly said, "I am not lifting a stone to drop on my own feet; I am dropping it on my errors." When there were few speeches during the criticism meeting, he encouraged everyone to speak actively.

After the criticism meeting ended, he read to everyone Chairman Mao's words on "grasp the revolution and promote production," and then assigned the production tasks.

With Ardent Enthusiasm, Helping Comrades

After receiving multiple criticisms and help from the commune members, Ming Songwu led the entire brigade to fiercely grasp the revolution and vigorously promote production with even greater enthusiasm.

One day, he went to the Third Team to propagate Chairman Mao's latest instructions. During his conversation with the commune members, he discovered that many people had complaints about the team leader, Wang Shaocheng, believing that he could not withstand the criticism of the masses. When the masses criticized some of his errors, he threw down his responsibilities and refused to continue.

Ming Songwu decided to help Wang Shaocheng unload his mental burden and move forward lightly. However, he also felt that since he had made mistakes, how could he do work for others? The five shining golden words, "criticize and repudiate," instantly illuminated his heart. He realized that fearing to give others advice, not daring to boldly criticize others' errors, and help them correct them, was actually "not being full of enthusiasm for comrades and the people, but being cold and indifferent, indifferent, and numb," which went against the teachings of Chairman Mao. This was his private thoughts acting up again, and he must resolutely overcome them!

Thus, Ming Songwu quickly found Wang Shaocheng and had a heart-to-heart talk with him, studying "In Memory of Norman Bethune" and Chairman Mao's latest instructions together, helping him correctly handle the criticisms of the masses. He told Wang Shaocheng, "You have been a cadre for over a decade, with achievements and also shortcomings and errors. Achievements should be carried forward and not relied on; errors should be corrected and new achievements should be sought." Wang Shaocheng listened to Ming Songwu's words, and his heart was in turmoil. He recalled that once, Ming Songwu had just returned from a commune meeting and heard that the Sixth Team had some complaints about him. Without eating, he immediately went to humbly accept the criticisms of the masses; he also recalled the day the First Team was planting wheat. Just as it was time to stop work, it suddenly started raining. Ming Songwu read to everyone Chairman Mao's words: "With firm resolve, fearing no sacrifice, overcoming all difficulties, and striving for victory." He organized the masses to brave the rain and rush to plant, finally completing the entire field....

Wang Shaocheng recalled Ming Songwu's deeds of loving the collective and the masses, feeling ashamed. When Ming Songwu was about to leave, he gave Wang Shaocheng a passage from Chairman Mao: "Errors and setbacks have taught us, making us somewhat wiser. Our work is done better. Any party or individual will inevitably make mistakes. We ask for fewer mistakes. Once mistakes are made, we ask for quick and thorough corrections."

Wang Shaocheng returned home and, after a fierce struggle within himself, admitted his errors. He voluntarily checked his shortcomings and errors in three consecutive team committee meetings and commune member meetings, gaining the welcome and understanding of the commune members, and finally stood up.

Educating Family Members to Join the Revolution Together

Just as Ming Songwu was making progress in criticizing and repudiating, his family members heard some of the criticisms from the masses, could not analyze them correctly, and had some grievances, blowing some "cold wind" at Ming Songwu.

One evening, Ming Songwu convened a family meeting. He planned to persuade his wife and children to participate in the commune's mass meeting the next day to experience the wind and rain, see the world, and receive education. However, this persuasion work was not so simple. His wife, after hearing his mobilization, said in a huff, "You alone made mistakes, and the whole family has no face to show..." His children also said some discouraging words. Seeing this, he asked himself: Can I give the green light to the private thoughts of my loved ones? Can I let them get away with such incorrect statements? No! He thought: Due to the thousands of threads connecting loved ones with oneself in thoughts and feelings, old habits often make them unable to correctly handle mass movements, unable to stand on the side of revolutionary masses, but rather protect oneself, cover up one's shortcomings and errors, and even blame and complain about the masses. This is very dangerous.

That night, he organized the entire family to seriously study the "Three Articles" and the "Report on an Investigation of the Peasant Movement in Hunan," and at the same time, explained the "Sixteen Points" to them word for word, connecting his own experiences of criticizing and repudiating, exposing the evil of the "private" thoughts, and recalling the bitter family history. He told his mother, "Mother, do you forget the days of exploitation in Tanmu Bay before liberation? One sister was sold as a maid, one sister starved to death from eating husks, and grandfather begged for food and died from a fall..." Saying this, his mother and wife both cried.

After this family meeting, Ming Songwu's entire family took a step forward on the path of ideological revolutionization. The next morning, Ming Songwu and his wife and children happily went to the brigade to participate in the mass meeting.

What Should Be Managed Must Be Managed

Although the mass criticism meeting of Ming Songwu had ended, he did not regard it as the end of ideological reform.

Once, Ming Songwu discovered half a basket of sweet potatoes in the kitchen, which did not seem to be distributed by the production team. He immediately questioned his wife. His wife said they were sweet potatoes picked by the children from the production team's sweet potato field. Ming Songwu heard this and immediately told the children to send the sweet potatoes back to the team.

His wife said, "Other people's children also picked them. Why do we have to hand them in?"

Ming Songwu said, "Because we are cadres, servants of the people. This is not a matter of a few dozen catties of sweet potatoes, but a matter of whether to listen to Chairman Mao's words, whether to walk the socialist path, whether to be selfless, and whether to love the collective."

These words made his wife lower her head. Immediately, he read to his wife a passage from "In Memory of Norman Bethune": "We must all learn from his spirit of selflessness."

His wife said ashamedly, "My private thoughts are too heavy. Your criticism is correct." She immediately told the children to send the sweet potatoes back to the production team.

Later, Ming Songwu proposed at a meeting of production team cadres and revolutionary masses organizing servants that if commune members picked sweet potatoes from the production team, they should be handed over to the production team and credited with work points according to the quantity. This matter was supported and approved by many poor and lower-middle peasant commune members. However, some commune members said Ming Songwu was "meddling in other people's business." Ming Songwu thought: I should always remember Chairman Mao's teachings: "Our responsibility is to the people." What should be managed must be managed, what should be said must be said, and what should be done must be done.

One day, Ming Songwu returned from a commune meeting and heard the commune members say that a servant of a revolutionary mass organization had neglected the collective wheat and first tended to his own private plot. Ming Songwu heard this and was somewhat angry, wanting to immediately convene a meeting to criticize. But he thought, since he is a servant of a mass organization and I am a "person in power," he criticized me in the past, and now I am criticizing him. Will this be seen as "retaliation"? Ming Songwu's thoughts were in fierce struggle.

The night was already deep. Ming Songwu was still bent over the kerosene lamp, seriously studying "Oppose Liberalism." The more he studied, the more he felt that Chairman Mao's criticism of liberalism was as if directed at him. Ming Songwu shed tears of shame, feeling that he had let down Chairman Mao and the poor and lower-middle peasant commune members. He thought, "Chairman Mao made me a cadre to be responsible for the revolution, but now I am 'afraid' at the forefront, 'private' thoughts entangling my feet. When faced with a matter, I always think of myself first, and at the critical moment, I shrink back. Is this 'completely' and 'thoroughly' serving the people?"

The next day, Ming Songwu found that servant and boldly criticized his error of neglecting the collective wheat and first tending to his private plot, and studied "In Memory of Norman Bethune" with him. That servant, upon hearing Ming Songwu's words, was deeply moved, tightly holding Ming Songwu's hand, and said after a long time, "Old Ming, what you said is completely reasonable! I was wrong, I let down Chairman Mao."

The next day, he voluntarily checked his errors in the production team cadre meeting and production team member meeting. The commune members happily said, "Old Ming did not let down our criticisms and help. He loves the collective more than before. He is indeed a good cadre who is wholeheartedly devoted to the revolution."

    风浪中的革命人
    ——记四川省自贡市永安公社七一大队党支部书记明松武
    陈轲　崔华　张鉴　万春
    四川自贡市永安公社七一大队党支部书记、老贫农明松武，群众称赞他是“风浪中的革命人”。这个做了十几年农村基层工作的干部，在无产阶级文化大革命中，迎着群众斗争的大风大浪奋勇前进，把自己锤炼得更加坚实，更加成熟了。迎着大风大浪前进
    前年冬天，当文化大革命的熊熊烈火燃向自贡市郊区农村的时候，明松武怀着对伟大领袖毛主席的无限忠诚投入了运动。他认真学习了“十六条”，认为应该把“怕”字换成“敢”字，鼓励和支持革命群众起来大造党内一小撮走资派的反，同时也帮助干部纠正工作中的缺点和错误。当时，处在运动初期，社员群众还没有发动起来，他就三番五次地主动到永安中学去请红卫兵来社里点火。他说，这是请革命小将来帮助抓牛鬼蛇神，烧一烧自己身上的脏东西。
    群众起来了，火点燃了。运动的猛烈声势却给他一定的压力；再加上家里的人对运动不太理解，拖后腿，他有点害怕起来。这个念头刚一闪现，他就想起了毛主席的教导：“嘴里天天说‘唤起民众’，民众起来了又害怕得要死，这和叶公好龙有什么两样！”这段话一针见血地击中了他的要害，他猛省到：一个共产党员，在无产阶级文化大革命中，绝不能当可耻的逃兵。于是，他就积极地去参加社员召开的大小会议，听取群众的批评，从不缺席。
    在明松武家的墙上，有三篇群众给他写的大字报。那是去年二月他主动从外面拣回来贴在墙上的。有的社员看到大字报后对他说：“扯下来算了。”他说：
  “不能扯，因为它揭露了自己的缺点，应该多贴几天，经常给自己敲敲警钟。”
    要更好地取得群众的帮助和监督，就要自己敢于“亮私”。开始，明松武有顾虑，他怕说出了过去别人从来不知道的事，亮出别人不曾觉察的“私”以后，群众会抓住小辫子，批评得更厉害；怕造反派不谅解自己，上级不相信自己；怕今后说话群众不听，失掉
  “威信”。于是，“亮私”和“藏私”这两种思想，在他头脑中激烈地斗争起来。
    他反复学习了毛主席的教导：“无数革命先烈为了人民的利益牺牲了他们的生命，使我们每个活着的人想起他们就心里难过，难道我们还有什么个人利益不能牺牲，还有什么错误不能抛弃吗？”他责问自己：革命先烈把自己的一切毫无保留地贡献给革命事业，我却想把自己的“私”字锁进“保密柜”，这对得起革命先烈吗？对得起毛主席和革命群众的期望吗？经过激烈的思想斗争，他毅然地在社员会上大胆地亮了自己的种种私心。有个别社员说他这是“搬起石头砸自己的脚”。他严肃而认真地说：“我搬起石头砸的不是自己的脚，砸的是我的错误。”当批评会上发言少的时候，他动员大家积极发言。
    批评会结束后，他又给大家读毛主席关于“抓革命，促生产”的语录，然后把生产任务布置下去。
      满腔热忱地帮助同志
    经过社员的多次批评帮助，明松武更加积极地领导全大队狠抓革命，猛促生产。
    一天，他到三队宣传毛主席的最新指示。在和社员交谈中，他发现不少人对生产队长王少成有意见，认为他经不起群众批评的考验，群众批评了他的一些错误，他就撂挑子不干了。
    明松武决定帮助王少成卸掉思想包袱，轻装前进。但是，他又觉得自己犯过错误，怎么好给人家做工作呢？“要斗私，批修”五个金光闪闪的大字，一下把他的心照得亮堂堂的。他认识到怕给别人提意见，不敢大胆批评别人的错误，帮助他改正，实际上是
  “对同志对人民不是满腔热忱，而是冷冷清清，漠不关心，麻木不仁”，违背了毛主席他老人家的教导。这是自己的私心又在作怪，一定要坚决克服！
    于是，明松武便很快找到王少成，同他谈心，和他一起学习《为人民服务》以及毛主席的最新指示，帮助他正确对待群众的批评。他对王少成说：“你当干部十多年了，有成绩，也有缺点和错误。成绩要发扬，不能吃老本；错误要改正，争取立新功。”王少成听着明松武这些话，心里直翻腾。他想起有一次，明松武刚从公社开会回来，听说六队社员对他有些意见，连饭也没吃，就主动去虚心接受群众批评的情景；又想起一队种小麦的那天，快收工了，突然下起雨来，明松武给大家读着毛主席语录：“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利。”组织群众冒雨抢种，终于坚持把那块地全部种完。……王少成想起了明松武这一件件热爱集体，热爱群众的事，内心感到惭愧。明松武临走的时候，又送了一段毛主席语录给王少成：“错误和挫折教训了我们，使我们比较地聪明起来了，我们的事情就办得好一些。任何政党，任何个人，错误总是难免的，我们要求犯得少一点。犯了错误则要求改正，改正得越迅速，越彻底，越好。”
    王少成回到家里，经过一场激烈的思想斗争，认识了错误，先后三次主动地在队委会和社员会上深刻地检查了自己的缺点错误，得到了社员的欢迎和谅解，终于站出来了。
      教育家庭成员共同革命
    正当明松武在斗私批修中不断前进的时候，他家里的人听见了群众提的一些意见，没能正确分析，有些怨气，给明松武吹了一些“冷风”。
    一天晚上，明松武召开了家庭会。他准备说服自己的妻子和孩子，明天一道参加大队里的群众大会，去经风雨，见世面，受教育。但是，这个说服工作确实不那么简单。他的妻子听了他的动员后，赌气地说：“你一个人犯了错误，全家都没脸见人……。”他的孩子也说了些泄气话。看到这些情景，他问自己：能给亲人的私心开绿灯吗？能对他们这种不正确说法听之任之吗？不能！他想：由于亲人同自己在思想感情上千丝万缕的联系，旧的习惯势力往往使她（他）们不能正确地对待群众运动，不能站在革命群众一边，而是袒护自己，掩盖自己的缺点错误，甚至责怪群众、埋怨群众。这是十分危险的。
    这一夜，他便组织全家认真地学习了“老三篇”和《湖南农民运动考察报告》，同时又把“十六条”一字一句地讲给大家听，并联系自己斗私批修的体会，揭露了“私”字的罪恶，回忆了苦难的家史。他对母亲说，“娘，你忘记了解放前在檀木湾受剥削的日子吗？一个妹顶债当了丫头，一个妹没吃的，咽糠活活卡死，祖父讨饭跌死……”。说着说着，他母亲、妻子都哭了。
    经过这次家庭会，明松武全家在思想革命化的大道上前进了一步。第二天一早，明松武和他妻子、孩子一道，高高兴兴地到大队去参加了群众大会。
          该管的就是要管
    群众批评明松武的大会虽然结束了，但是，明松武没有把它看成是思想改造的结束。
    一次，明松武发现灶房里有半箩筐红苕，不象是生产队分给的，于是就追问妻子。妻子说是孩子从生产队挖过的红苕地里拣来的。明松武听了，立即叫孩子把红苕送到队里去。
    妻子说：“人家的孩子也一样拣了，为啥子偏偏我们要交？”
    明松武说：“因为我们是干部，是人民的勤务员，这不是几十斤红苕的问题，而是听不听毛主席的话，走不走社会主义道路，为不为公，爱不爱集体的问题。”
    一席话说得妻子低下了头。紧接着，他又给妻子读了《纪念白求恩》中的一段话：“我们大家要学习他毫无自私自利之心的精神。”
    妻子很惭愧地说：“我的私心太重了，你批评得正确。”便马上叫孩子把红苕送回了生产队。
    后来，明松武又在一次生产队干部和革命群众组织勤务员的会议上，提出凡是社员拣生产队的红苕，应该交给生产队，采取按数量记工分的办法。这件事受到很多贫下中农社员的拥护和赞成。但是，也有个别社员说明松武是“管闲事”。明松武想：我应该牢记毛主席的教导：“我们的责任，是向人民负责。”该管的就是要管，该说的就是要说，该干的就是要干。
    一天，明松武从公社开会回来，听社员反映：有个革命群众组织的勤务员放下集体的麦子不管，首先搞了自己的自留地。明松武听了这话，有些生气，想立即开会批评。但转念一想，觉得他是群众组织的勤务员，自己是“当权派”，过去人家批评过自己，现在自己又去批评人家，这会不会被说成是“打击报复”呢？明松武的思想发生了激烈的斗争。
    夜，已经很深了。明松武还伏在煤油灯前认真地学习着《反对自由主义》。他越学越觉得毛主席对自由主义的批评，好象就在说自己。明松武流出了惭愧的眼泪，他觉得对不起毛主席，对不起贫下中农社员。他想：“毛主席叫我当干部，就是叫我对革命负责任，而现在自己却‘怕’字当头，‘私’字缠脚，一事当前，总是先替自己打算，关键的时候，就缩了回去，这叫‘完全’‘彻底’为人民服务吗？”
    第二天，明松武就找了那个勤务员同志，大胆地批评了他不管集体麦子而首先顾自留地的错误，和他一起学习了《为人民服务》。那个勤务员听了明松武的话，十分感动，紧握着明松武的手，半天只说了一句话：“老明，你说的话完全在理啊！我错了，我对不起毛主席他老人家。”第二天，他就主动在生产队干部会议和生产队社员会议上检查了自己的错误。社员们高兴地说：“老明没有辜负我们的批评帮助，他比以前更热爱集体了，他不愧是一心为革命的好干部。”
