Xinhua News Agency, Sana'a, April 12 — Yemeni Prime Minister and Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces Hassan Amri said on April 11 that people from all walks of life in Yemen, regardless of age or gender, highly praise the deep friendship between the peoples of Yemen and China.

When talking about the recent victory of the Yemeni people in repelling the armed subversion of the Yemeni republican government plotted by U.S. imperialism, he said, "When the Yemeni people were in a critical situation, when the Hodeidah-Sana'a highway was cut off, and when the Sana'a Textile Factory was shelled, when all other foreigners had fled, the Chinese friends here bravely stood at their posts, firmly stood by the Yemeni people, and worked and fought side by side with the Yemeni people. This has set a good example for the Yemeni people. The Yemeni people are learning this fearless spirit and spirit of self-sacrifice to defend the revolution and build the republic."

Prime Minister Amri told the Yemeni workers at the textile factory, "Under the leadership of the great leader Chairman Mao, China is making rapid progress and development. We Yemeni people should also build and develop our country like the Chinese people."

He called on all the workers in the factory to work hard, speed up production, defend the revolution and the republic, and oppose imperialism and reactionaries.

Accompanied by the head of the Chinese textile technology team, Xie Wuyuan, Prime Minister Amri carefully inspected the various workshops of the factory and learned about the entire production process.

Prime Minister Amri said, "The increase in the factory's products is due to the joint efforts of Yemeni workers and Chinese technicians."

He pointed out, "This shows that Chinese technicians have contributed to the continuous improvement of the technical level of Yemeni workers; it also shows that despite the conspiracies of imperialism and reactionaries against our country, the Yemeni people are able to build their own country."

During the inspection, Prime Minister Amri was very pleased to see Yemeni workers mastering various advanced textile technologies.

He also warmly praised the small packaging machine recently made by Yemeni workers with the help of Chinese technicians.

He said, "The Yemeni people will definitely be able to develop their own economy and culture and advance together with other fighting peoples in the world."

Yemeni Minister of Transportation Abdul Rahmani accompanied Prime Minister Amri in visiting the factory.

The Yemeni people enthusiastically praise China's help in building the Sana'a Textile Factory and highly praise the deep friendship between the peoples of Yemen and China.

    他在谈到也门人民最近胜利反击美帝国主义策划的武装颠覆也门共和政权的斗争时说，当也门人民处于紧急关头，荷台达—萨那公路被切断，萨那纺织厂遭到炮击的时候，当所有其他外国人都逃走了的时候，这里的中国朋友不怕危险，坚守工作岗位，坚决站在也门人民一边，同也门人民一道工作和斗争。这为也门人民树立了良好的榜样，也门人民正在学习这种大无畏的精神和自我牺牲的精神，以保卫革命，建设共和国。
    阿姆里总理对纺织厂的也门职工说，中国在伟大领袖毛主席的领导下，正在取得迅速的发展和进步。我们也门人民应当象中国人民一样，建设和发展我们的国家。
    他号召全厂职工努力工作，加紧生产，保卫革命和共和国，反对帝国主义和反动派。
    阿姆里总理在中国纺织技术组组长谢武元陪同下仔细视察了工厂的各个车间，并了解整个生产过程。
    阿姆里总理说，这个厂产品的增加要归功于也门工人和中国技术人员的共同努力。
    他指出，这表明中国技术人员对也门工人的技术水平不断提高作出了贡献；这也表明尽管帝国主义和反动派正在对我国进行阴谋活动，也门人民是能够建设他们的祖国的。
    阿姆里总理在视察时看到也门工人掌握了多种多样的先进纺织技术感到非常高兴。
    他并热烈称赞也门工人在中国技术人员帮助下最近制造的小型包装机。
    他说，也门人民一定能够发展自己的经济和文化，同世界上其他战斗的人民一起前进。
