Through revolutionary criticism, the workers at the Qingdao Sifang Locomotive and Rolling Stock Works have overcome anarchism and established socialist labor discipline. Most of the workshops and departments in the factory have drafted their own "Revolution and Production Agreement," significantly strengthening the workers' revolutionary discipline. In the first quarter, the factory exceeded the state plan by 29%, and production has been steadily rising in April.

Editor's Note: The "Revolution and Production Agreement" drafted by the revolutionary workers of the Qingdao Sifang Locomotive and Rolling Stock Works fully reflects the collective wisdom and creativity of the broad revolutionary masses, embodying the great sense of responsibility of the working class as the masters of the state. During the unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the revolutionary workers have steadfastly held their production posts and achieved outstanding results, deserving of commendation.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "Without destruction, there can be no construction; without obstruction, there can be no flow; without cessation, there can be no progress." The "Revolution and Production Agreements" of many units in the Sifang Locomotive and Rolling Stock Works are new things that have emerged on the basis of revolutionary criticism, breaking away from the old revisionist enterprise management system and establishing a new system that shines with the brilliant light of Mao Zedong Thought.

Anarchism and socialist labor discipline are incompatible. In some places, class enemies are using anarchist currents to undermine the revolutionary authority of the newly established revolutionary committees and sabotage socialist construction. This should alert us to the high degree of revolutionary vigilance. Let us closely follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, unite on the basis of Mao Zedong Thought, and resolutely overcome anarchism. Let us model exemplary adherence to socialist labor discipline and, in implementing the great policy of "Revolution and Production," create new achievements for the people.

According to a Xinhua News Agency report from Jinan on the 24th, many workshops in the Qingdao Sifang Locomotive and Rolling Stock Works have, based on the development of revolutionary criticism, overcome the influence of anarchist currents and recently drafted "Revolution and Production Agreements" that emphasize Mao Zedong Thought and rely on the masses to run the enterprise. This agreement, drafted by the masses themselves, has unified the will and actions of the revolutionary workers, further mobilizing everyone's revolutionary enthusiasm and receiving enthusiastic support from the revolutionary workers.

The "Revolution and Production Agreement" was first proposed by a group of veteran workers in the locomotive repair workshop. After more than a year of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the workshop has undergone profound changes. Revolutionary workers have raised high the banner of revolutionary criticism, severely criticizing the revisionist line in enterprise management promoted by the handful of capitalist roaders within the Party, such as Liu Shaoqi, and severely criticizing the slave mentality peddled by Liu Shaoqi. The workshop's revolution and production have shown unprecedented good prospects. However, due to the lingering influence of the anarchist poison spread by Liu Shaoqi, some workers, especially young workers, have shown signs of anarchism and do not strictly follow labor discipline. Veteran workers have sharply criticized the disorderly and undisciplined phenomena in the workshop, and the vast majority of revolutionary workers are also deeply pained by the impact of a few people's free and easy behavior on the entire workshop's revolution and production.

In mid-February, some veteran workers from the lathe group two, lathe group four, and machining group three in the workshop successively approached the workshop revolutionary committee, requesting that, in response to the anarchist phenomena in the workshop, the masses be mobilized to draft an agreement conducive to revolution and production.

The veteran workers' proposal received enthusiastic support from the majority of workers and the workshop revolutionary committee. Workers repeatedly studied Chairman Mao's teachings: "We must resolutely overcome the state of indiscipline or anarchism that exists in many places," and "Anarchism does not conform to the interests and wishes of the people." They recognized that reactionary anarchism is a poisonous arrow used by the handful of class enemies, such as Liu Shaoqi, to sabotage the revolution and production, and must be further criticized and thoroughly eliminated. Based on the veteran workers' proposal, the masses were mobilized to draft the workshop's "Revolution and Production Agreement," consolidating the workshop's new revolutionary order.

Under the organization and leadership of the workshop revolutionary committee, the revolutionary workers in the locomotive repair workshop quickly launched a criticism of anarchism. They set up many part-time Mao Zedong Thought study classes, gathering voluntarily after work and meals to discuss specific examples from the workshop and team, denouncing the damage caused by anarchism to the workshop's revolution and production, and using Mao Zedong Thought to analyze the political and ideological roots of the anarchist current. Some veteran workers shared their experiences of being exploited and oppressed in the old society, contrasting it with the sweetness of the new society, giving everyone a profound class education. After a week of discussion, revolutionary workers had a deep understanding of the harm of anarchism, and their proletarian consciousness was significantly enhanced. Some workers who previously paid less attention to labor discipline sincerely criticized themselves after realizing the harm of anarchism and offered constructive suggestions for drafting the workshop's "Revolution and Production Agreement," expressing their determination to be models of proletarian revolutionary discipline.

Next, the workshop revolutionary committee led the revolutionary masses to launch a revolutionary criticism of the revisionist enterprise management system, breaking away from some old systems that did not conform to Mao Zedong Thought and establishing a new system. In particular, they criticized the past tendency of the workshop to not emphasize proletarian politics and Mao Zedong Thought, establishing a complete system of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works.

During the drafting process of the agreement, everyone also criticized the idea of heavily punishing those who do not follow the rules. Everyone believed that in the agreement, whether to emphasize proletarian politics or implement material incentives and heavy punishments; whether to trust the masses or trust "control, restrict, and suppress" is a struggle between two lines. In this struggle, we must never be vigilant, otherwise, the old habits will easily drag us back to the old path.

On the basis of deeply developing revolutionary criticism, a draft of the "Revolution and Production Agreement" from the masses was formulated. This agreement is led by Mao Zedong Thought and embodies the revolutionary spirit of relying on the masses to run the enterprise. The agreement emphasizes that all revolutionary workers should hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, be absolutely loyal to Chairman Mao, absolutely loyal to the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, and absolutely loyal to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. They should fully implement Chairman Mao's series of latest instructions, resolutely support the correct leadership of all levels of proletarian revolutionary power, and firmly implement the instructions of the proletarian headquarters headed by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin. Workshops and teams should hold various types of Mao Zedong Thought study classes, establish a revolutionary learning style of linking theory with practice, and take "criticize selfishness and repudiate revisionism" as the key to seriously study and apply Chairman Mao's brilliant works "Old Five Articles," thoroughly overcome bourgeois factionalism and anarchism, and enhance proletarian party spirit and revolutionary, scientific, and organizational discipline. They should resolutely implement Chairman Mao's great policy of "Revolution and Production," emphasize proletarian politics, put revolution first, and do a good job in revolutionary criticism and the struggle-criticism-transformation of the unit.

The agreement stipulates that all revolutionary workers in the workshop should voluntarily abide by various reasonable rules and regulations and supervise their implementation; strictly abide by socialist labor discipline, insist on the eight-hour workday and revolutionary activities in spare time, and oppose absenteeism and truancy without reason; resolutely respond to Chairman Mao's great call to "be thrifty and make revolution," cherish production equipment and tools, and cherish manpower, materials, and raw materials.

The agreement also stipulates that each team should hold a reporting meeting every weekend to check and summarize the implementation of the agreement. Timely praise and publicity should be given to workers who have made outstanding achievements in studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought and promoting revolution and production, setting examples. For workers who violate the agreement, they should be guided by the principle of "unity-criticism and self-criticism-unity" to do more ideological work and conduct criticism and education.

After the draft of the "Revolution and Production Agreement" for the locomotive repair workshop was formulated, most workers were satisfied. However, a few teams raised objections to this agreement, believing that all cadres in the workshop should be responsible for opposing anarchism and should have a special clause in the agreement. The broad revolutionary masses agreed with this opinion. The revolutionary masses also praised the cadres of the lathe group four for their daring and responsible attitude in the previous struggle against anarchist currents and criticized some cadres for their liberal tendencies in production management. The workshop revolutionary committee, based on the opinions of the masses, added another clause to the draft of the agreement: "Revolutionary new and old cadres should break with selfishness and establish public spirit, dare to take the lead, insist on principles, dare to manage what should be managed, dare to say what should be said, and dare to do what should be done. They should fully mobilize the masses to carry out active ideological struggles against some bad phenomena."

After supplementation, the "Revolution and Production Agreement" for the locomotive repair workshop was officially born.

The revolutionary committee of the Qingdao Sifang Locomotive and Rolling Stock Works promptly grasped this new thing that emerged from the masses and promoted it throughout the factory. Currently, more than 80% of the workshops and departments in the factory, like the locomotive repair workshop, use the invincible Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon to draft "Revolution and Production Agreements" on the basis of revolutionary criticism. The revolutionary discipline of all workers in the factory has been significantly strengthened, and the revolutionary and production situation has been greatly improved. In the first quarter, the factory exceeded the state plan by 29%, and production continued to rise steadily in the first twenty days of April.

    通过革命大批判克服无政府主义
    发动群众建立社会主义劳动纪律
    青岛四方机车车辆厂大部分车间和科室群众自己制订“抓革命，促生产公约”，职工革命纪律性大大加强。第一季度超额百分之二十九完成国家计划，四月份生产稳定上升
    编者按：青岛四方机车车辆厂由革命职工自己制订的“抓革命，促生产公约”，充分体现了广大革命人民群众集体的智慧和集体的创造精神，体现了工人阶级国家主人翁的伟大责任感。在史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命中，广大革命职工，坚守生产岗位，创造了优异成绩，应该受到表彰。
    毛主席教导我们：“不破不立，不塞不流，不止不行”。四方机车车辆厂许多单位的“抓革命，促生产公约”，正是在革命大批判的基础上出现的新事物，是破除旧的修正主义企业管理制度，而建立起来的闪耀着毛泽东思想灿烂光辉的新制度。
     无政府主义和社会主义劳动纪律是不相容的。在某些地方，阶级敌人正在利用无政府主义思潮，破坏新生的革命委员会的革命权威，破坏社会主义建设事业。这一点，应该引起我们高度的革命警惕。让我们紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，在毛泽东思想的基础上联合起来，团结起来，坚决地克服无政府主义，模范地遵守社会主义劳动纪律，在贯彻执行抓革命促生产的伟大方针中，为人民立新功。
    据新华社济南二十四日电　青岛四方机车车辆厂许多车间的革命职工，在开展革命大批判的基础上，克服无政府主义思潮的影响，不久前制订了突出毛泽东思想、依靠群众办好企业的“抓革命，促生产公约”。这种由群众自己制订的公约，统一了革命职工的意志和行动，进一步调动了大家的革命积极性，受到了革命职工的热烈拥护。
      “抓革命，促生产公约”，是这个工厂修机车间的一批老工人首先倡议制订的。经过一年多的无产阶级文化大革命，这个车间发生了极为深刻的变化。革命职工高举革命大批判的旗帜，狠批了中国赫鲁晓夫等党内一小撮走资派在企业管理上推行的修正主义路线，狠批了中国赫鲁晓夫贩卖的奴隶主义黑货，车间的革命和生产出现了空前大好的形势。但是，由于中国赫鲁晓夫散布的无政府主义黑货的影响没有完全肃清，一部分职工特别是青年职工中滋长了无政府主义的苗头，对劳动纪律遵守不够。老工人们对车间里出现的无组织无纪律现象提出了尖锐的批评，绝大多数革命职工对由于少数人自由放任而使整个车间的革命和生产受到影响，也十分痛心。
    二月中旬，这个车间钳工二组、钳工四组和加工三组的一些老工人相继找到车间革命委员会，要求针对车间存在的无政府主义现象，发动群众制订一个有利于抓革命、促生产的公约。
    老工人的建议得到了绝大多数职工和车间革命委员会的热烈支持。职工们反复学习了毛主席的教导：“必须坚决地克服许多地方存在着的某些无纪律状态或无政府状态”，“无政府状态不符合人民的利益和愿望”，认识到反动的无政府主义，是中国赫鲁晓夫等一小撮阶级敌人用来破坏革命、破坏生产的一支毒箭，必须进一步开展革命的大批判，彻底肃清它的影响，并在此基础上，根据老工人的建议，发动群众，制订车间的“抓革命，促生产公约”，巩固车间的革命新秩序。
    在车间革命委员会的组织和领导下，修机车间的革命职工迅速展开了对无政府主义的批判。他们办起了许多业余毛泽东思想学习班，工余饭后，职工们自觉地聚集在一起，联系本车间、本班组的具体事例，控诉无政府主义给车间的革命和生产造成的损失，用毛泽东思想分析产生无政府主义思潮的政治根源和思想根源。一些老工人，向大家介绍了在旧社会受剥削、受压迫的苦，对比了新社会的甜，使大家受到一次深刻的阶级教育。经过一个星期的讨论，革命职工对无政府主义的危害性有了深刻的认识，无产阶级觉悟有了很大提高。有些过去不大注意遵守劳动纪律的职工，在认识到无政府主义的危害性后，诚恳地作了自我批评，并且对订好车间的“抓革命，促生产公约”提出了建设性的意见，表示决心做遵守无产阶级革命纪律的模范。
    接着，车间革命委员会又引导革命群众对修正主义的企业管理制度进行了革命的大批判，破除了一些不符合毛泽东思想的旧制度，建立了一套新制度。特别是批判了过去车间不突出无产阶级政治，不突出毛泽东思想的倾向，建立了一整套活学活用毛主席著作的制度。
    在拟订公约的过程中，大家还批判了对不守纪律的人要重罚这样一种意见。大家认为，在公约里，是突出无产阶级政治，还是实行物质刺激、大奖大罚；是相信群众，还是相信“管、卡、压”，这是两条路线的斗争。在这场斗争面前，万万不可失去警觉，不然，旧的习惯势力就很容易把我们拉回到老路上去。
    在深入开展革命大批判的基础上，一个来自群众的“抓革命，促生产公约”（草案）制订出来了。这个公约以毛泽东思想挂帅，贯彻了依靠群众办好企业的革命精神。公约强调，全体革命职工要高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，无限忠于毛主席，无限忠于战无不胜的毛泽东思想，无限忠于毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，全面落实毛主席的一系列最新指示，要坚决拥护各级无产阶级革命政权的正确领导，对以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部的指示要坚决贯彻执行；车间和班组都要大办各种类型的毛泽东思想学习班，树立理论联系实际的革命学风，以“斗私，批修”为纲，认真活学活用毛主席的光辉著作“老五篇”，彻底克服资产阶级派性和无政府主义，增强无产阶级党性和革命性、科学性、组织纪律性；要坚决贯彻毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的伟大方针，突出无产阶级政治，把革命放在首位，搞好革命的大批判和本单位的斗批改。
    公约规定，车间的全体革命职工要自觉遵守各种合理的规章制度，并监督这些规章制度的贯彻执行；严格遵守社会主义劳动纪律，坚持八小时工作制和业余闹革命，反对无故旷工、缺勤；坚决响应毛主席“要节约闹革命”的伟大号召，爱护生产设备和工具，要爱惜人力、物力，节约原料、材料。
    公约还规定，每周末各班组召开一次讲用会，检查、总结公约执行情况。及时表扬、宣传在活学活用毛泽东思想、抓革命，促生产方面做出显著成绩的职工，树立榜样。对违犯公约的职工，要按照“团结——批评和自我批评——团结”的原则，多做思想工作，进行批评教育。
    修机车间“抓革命，促生产公约”（草案）制订出来后，大多数职工都很满意。但是，有几个班组对这个公约提出了意见，他们认为，车间的所有干部，对反对无政府主义都负有责任，应该在公约上专门给干部订上一条。广大革命职工赞同这一条意见。革命群众还赞扬了钳工四组的干部在前段同无政府主义思潮进行斗争中敢于大胆负责，也批评了一些干部在生产管理工作中“怕”字当头的自由主义倾向。车间革命委员会根据群众的意见，在公约的草案中又加上了一条：“革命的新老干部，要破私立公，以身作则，敢字当头，坚持原则。做到该管的敢管，该说的敢说，该做的敢做。对一些不良现象要充分发动群众，开展积极的思想斗争。”
    经过补充，修机车间“抓革命，促生产公约”正式诞生了。
    青岛四方机车车辆厂革命委员会及时抓住从群众中涌现出来的这个新事物，在全厂范围内加以推广。目前全厂已有百分之八十以上的车间和科室象修机车间一样，以战无不胜的毛泽东思想为武器，在革命大批判的基础上制订了“抓革命，促生产公约”。全厂职工的革命纪律性大大加强，革命和生产面貌焕然一新。第一季度超额百分之二十九完成了国家计划，四月份的头二十天生产继续稳定上升。
