Burmese and Indian reactionary leaders hold secret talks
Plot joint anti-China actions and suppress border ethnic armed struggles

According to a Xinhua News Agency report, New Delhi: The Burmese reactionary government leader Ne Win conducted eight days of conspiratorial activities in India from March 15 to March 22. He plotted with the Indian reactionary leader Indira Gandhi to jointly oppose China and suppress armed ethnic struggles on the India-Burma border.

Ne Win's talks with Indira Gandhi in New Delhi were conducted in secret. According to Western news agencies, during the talks on March 16, "most of the time, only the two of them were present." During the second round of talks on March 21, they were "in private talks." After the talks ended, Indian reactionary government officials "refused to disclose any details."

However, their conspiratorial activities could not be completely hidden. Agence France-Presse reported that this was Ne Win's "first visit to New Delhi since the Burmese reactionaries launched a large-scale anti-China campaign last June." He and the Indian reactionary leader Indira Gandhi "mainly discussed the two countries' relations with China," that is, plotting for the Burmese and Indian reactionaries to jointly oppose China.

According to Western news agencies and the Indian Press Trust of India, Ne Win and Indira Gandhi also secretly plotted to jointly suppress the ethnic armed forces opposing the Indian and Burmese reactionary governments and fighting for national liberation in the India-Burma border region. Both sides discussed reactionary measures such as "joint patrols" on the India-Burma border.

During Ne Win's visit to India, Indian reactionary Prime Minister Indira Gandhi and Defense Minister Singh made outrageous statements in parliament, falsely attributing the Indian reactionaries' bloody suppression of the Naga people and the Naga people's armed struggle for national liberation to China's "interference" in India. The Indian reactionaries have repeatedly spread such lies, aiming to create public opinion to justify the criminal collusion and joint suppression of ethnic armed forces on the borders of the two countries by the Indian and Burmese reactionaries.

### 缅印反动头子鬼鬼祟祟密谈  策划联合反华和共同镇压边境民族武装斗争

    缅印反动头子鬼鬼祟祟密谈
    策划联合反华和共同镇压边境民族武装斗争
    据新华社讯　新德里消息：缅甸反动政府头子奈温从三月十五日至二十二日到印度进行了八天阴谋活动，同印度反动派头子英迪拉·甘地策划联合反华和共同镇压印缅边界民族武装斗争的阴谋。
    奈温在新德里同英迪拉·甘地的会谈是秘密进行的。据西方通讯社透露，在三月十六日的会谈中，“大部分时间都只有他们两个人在场”。在三月二十一日进行第二轮会谈时，他们是“单独会谈”的。会谈结束后，印度反动政府的官员们“拒绝透露任何细节”。
    但是，他们的阴谋活动是不可能完全隐蔽起来的。法新社报道说，这是去年六月缅甸反动派发动大规模反华以来奈温“第一次到新德里来”。他和印度反动派头子英迪拉·甘地“主要是讨论两国同中国的关系”，也就是策划缅印两国反动派联合反华。
    据西方通讯社和印度报业托辣斯透露，奈温和英迪拉·甘地还秘密策划了联合镇压印缅边境地区的反对印缅反动政府、争取民族解放的民族武装的阴谋。双方密谈了在印缅边境“联合巡逻”等反动措施。
    就在奈温访印期间，印反动政府总理英迪拉·甘地和国防部长辛格在议会中大放厥词，硬把印度反动派对那加族的血腥镇压，迫使那加族进行争取民族解放的武装斗争，说成是中国对印度的“干涉”造成的。印度反动派多次散布这种谰言，其目的就是为了替印缅反动派进行罪恶的勾结、联合镇压两国边境的民族武装制造舆论。
