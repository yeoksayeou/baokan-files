The resounding victory songs of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution are echoing everywhere. The People's Daily, Red Flag Magazine, and Liberation Army Daily have published the important editorial "Revolutionary Committees Are Good," conveying Chairman Mao's latest instructions. We revolutionary soldiers are all overjoyed and fully support it with a thousand cheers and ten thousand endorsements.

The revolutionary committee is a great innovation by the revolutionary masses in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, a new thing personally nurtured by our great leader Chairman Mao, and a bountiful fruit of the Cultural Revolution. Revolutionary committees are good. They are good because they achieve the combination of representatives of revolutionary cadres, the military, and revolutionary masses; they are good because they implement unified leadership, eliminating the phenomena of large and overlapping administrative organs; they are good because they strengthen the dictatorship of the proletariat; they are good because they are deeply rooted among the masses, closely connected with the masses, and represent the revolutionary interests of the broad masses; they are good because they hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, leading the broad revolutionary masses to study and apply Chairman Mao's works, and serving as the command center for criticizing and repudiating revisionism and carrying out self-criticism; they are good because the members of the revolutionary committees are infinitely loyal to the great leader Chairman Mao, to the great Mao Zedong Thought, and to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. Such revolutionary committees are indeed good!

Chairman Mao teaches us: "The imperialists and domestic reactionaries will not reconcile themselves to their defeat. They will still make their last struggles. After the country is pacified, they will still engage in sabotage and disruption in various ways, trying to restore their rule in China every day and every hour." The class enemies will inevitably sabotage and disrupt the revolutionary committees. We must resolutely support and defend the revolutionary committees. The more the enemy curses, the more we say it is good; the more the enemy opposes, the more we support; the more the enemy wants to sabotage, the more we defend. We must be particularly vigilant against the class enemies playing the role of counter-revolutionary two-faced tricks, waving the "red flag" to oppose the red flag, extending their black hands into the new revolutionary power, attempting to shake and overthrow the new revolutionary committees.

The revolutionary power is our lifeline, the fundamental guarantee for the proletariat to obtain everything. We, the sentinels day and night guarding Chairman Mao, have infinite love and loyalty to the great leader Chairman Mao. We have deep class feelings for the revolutionary power born in the storms of class struggle. "Chairman Mao loves me, I love Chairman Mao; Chairman Mao supports me, I support Chairman Mao." For the new revolutionary power supported by Chairman Mao, we must cherish it like our eyes, resolutely support it, enthusiastically help it, and defend it with our lives. Whoever supports the great leader Chairman Mao, supports the great Mao Zedong Thought, supports Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, and supports the revolutionary committees supported by Chairman Mao, we will be close to them, support them, and help them; conversely, whoever wants to sabotage and split the new revolutionary committees, no matter how high their position is, no matter how skillfully they disguise themselves, we will thoroughly expose them and resolutely overthrow them.

We, the soldiers of the People's Liberation Army, always remember Chairman Mao's teaching to "never forget class struggle," constantly enhance our revolutionary vigilance, and vow to be the strong pillars of the dictatorship of the proletariat and the iron wall defending the new revolutionary power!

    热情爱护　坚决支持　誓死保卫
    北京卫戍区某部五好战士　赵明立　刘锡清
    在无产阶级文化大革命夺取全面胜利的阵阵凯歌声中，《人民日报》、《红旗》杂志、《解放军报》发表了《革命委员会好》的重要社论，传达了毛主席的最新指示。我们革命战士无不欢欣鼓舞，一千个欢呼，一万个拥护。
    革命委员会，是亿万革命群众在无产阶级文化大革命运动中的伟大创举，是我们伟大导师毛主席亲手培植的新生事物，是文化大革命结下的一个丰硕成果。革命委员会好，好就好在它实现了革命干部的代表、军队的代表、革命群众代表的三结合；好就好在它是一元化的领导，能够消除行政机构庞大、重叠的现象；好就好在它强化了无产阶级专政；好就好在它深深扎根于群众之中，和群众血肉相连，代表了广大人民的革命利益；好就好在它是高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，带领广大革命群众活学活用毛主席著作，进行斗私批修的指挥部；好就好在广大革委会成员对伟大领袖毛主席、对伟大的毛泽东思想、对毛主席的无产阶级革命路线无限忠诚。这样的革命委员会就是好！
    毛主席教导我们：“帝国主义者和国内反动派决不甘心于他们的失败，他们还要作最后的挣扎。在全国平定以后，他们也还会以各种方式从事破坏和捣乱，他们将每日每时企图在中国复辟。”阶级敌人必然要对革命委员会进行破坏和捣乱。我们就要坚决拥护和保卫革命委员会。敌人越是咒骂，我们越是说好；敌人越是反对，我们越要拥护；敌人越想破坏，我们越要保卫。我们要特别警惕阶级敌人玩弄反革命两面派手法，打着“红旗”反红旗，把黑手伸进新生的革命政权，妄图动摇和颠覆新生的革命委员会。
    革命政权是我们的命根子，是无产阶级得到一切的根本保证。我们日夜守卫在毛主席身边的警卫战士，对伟大领袖毛主席无限热爱，无限忠诚，对在阶级斗争的风浪中诞生的革命政权充满了深厚的阶级感情。“毛主席热爱我热爱，毛主席支持我支持”。我们对毛主席支持的新生的革命政权，就是要象爱护眼珠一样爱护它，坚决支持它，热情帮助它，誓死保卫它。谁拥护伟大领袖毛主席，拥护伟大的毛泽东思想，拥护毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，拥护毛主席支持的革命委员会，我们就亲近他，支持他，帮助他；反之，谁要是破坏和分裂新生的革命委员会，不管他职位多高，不管他伪装得多么巧妙，我们就要彻底揭露他，坚决打倒他。
    我们人民解放军战士时刻牢记毛主席“千万不要忘记阶级斗争”的教导，不断提高革命警惕性，誓做无产阶级专政的坚强支柱，誓做保卫新生的革命政权的钢铁长城！
