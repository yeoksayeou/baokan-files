Dearest and most respected Great Leader Chairman Mao:

Today, the 38 million heroic sons and daughters of your hometown, with hearts filled with immense excitement, report to you, our brightest red sun, a piece of news that is thrilling to the heart: Under the radiant guidance of your latest series of instructions, amidst the stormy winds of class struggle, the Hunan Provincial Revolutionary Committee has been born in victory!

The waves of Dongting Lake surge to the sky, and the people of Changsha sing and dance in poetry.
	Mao Zedong, Mao Zedong! On this day of great joy and celebration, we joyously shout out the great victory of your brilliant thoughts! From the shores of Dongting Lake to the foot of the Five Ridges, from the old revolutionary base in eastern Hunan to the villages of the Miao and Dong people in western Hunan, millions of smiling faces turn towards the red sun, and millions of red hearts fly to your side. We sincerely wish, wish that you, the venerable old man, live forever! Live forever!

“In the east, the red sun rises, China has given birth to Mao Zedong.” Heroic Hunan is the revolutionary holy land that all the people of China and the world long for.

Dear Chairman Mao, in the dark days of the “hundred-year demon dance,” it was you who organized the Marxist-Leninist Research Society, founded the Communist Youth League, and personally created and nurtured the great Chinese Communist Party.

It was you who, with the grand strategy of a proletarian revolutionary, broke through the thousand chains of the old world, personally led the Longsha woodworkers' great strike, and issued the earth-shaking voice of “Long live the workers,” sounding the death knell of old China!

It was you who, with a pair of straw sandals and an umbrella, traversed the three rivers and four lakes of Hunan, delved into the masses of workers and peasants, and wrote the immortal “Report on the Peasant Movement in Hunan,” solving the central problem of proletarian leadership—the problem of the peasant allies, and first proposing the great strategic thought of establishing a proletarian-led peasant armed force and peasant government.

It was you who, holding high the banner of armed struggle, in the critical moment when Chiang Kai-shek raised his butcher's knife against the revolutionary people, and Chen Duxiu and the Chinese Khrushchev knelt before the enemy, jointly strangling the revolution, personally led the Autumn Harvest Uprising, created the first people's armed force, established the Red Base of Jinggangshan, and opened the only correct path of encircling the cities from the countryside and seizing power by armed force for the Chinese revolution!

Mao Zedong, Mao Zedong! You led us through ten thousand rivers and mountains, fighting north and south of the Yangtze River, defeating the Japanese bandits, burying the Chiang dynasty; you led us to bind the azure dragon, conquer the rotten; you led us to draw grand plans, change the heavens.

We followed you and launched the socialist high tide in the countryside!
We followed you and beat the drums of the Great Leap Forward!
We followed you and insisted on and defended the socialist direction, smashed the counter-revolutionary revisionist line of the Chinese Khrushchev, and consolidated the socialist front in cities and countryside!

Mao Zedong, Mao Zedong! You brilliantly summarized the historical experience of the proletarian dictatorship at home and abroad, proposing a complete set of theories, lines, policies, methods, and measures for carrying out the revolution under the dictatorship of the proletariat. With the greatest courage and daring of a proletarian revolutionary, you personally initiated and led the unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, opening a new era in the international communist movement.

Dear Chairman Mao! Hunan has always been an important battlefield for the fierce struggle between revolution and counter-revolution. The clique of capitalists headed by the Chinese Khrushchev, for a long time, planted their trusted followers in Hunan, cultivated their henchmen, and vigorously promoted the counter-revolutionary revisionist line, attempting to turn Hunan into an important stronghold for the restoration of capitalism. The workers of Hunan, who are absolutely loyal to you, the Red Guards, and the broad masses of revolutionary proletarians, resolutely responded to your great battle call of “Bombard the Headquarters,” with deep hatred for the class enemies, holding high the banner of “It is reasonable to rebel,” breaking through the heavy encirclement of the bourgeois reactionary line, launching one fierce attack after another against the bourgeois headquarters, smashing the capitalist restoration tide, and defeating the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents in Hunan, such as Wang Yanchun, making them fall into disarray and suffer a complete collapse.

Mao Zedong, Mao Zedong! In the life-and-death struggle between the two classes, the two roads, and the two lines, it is your latest series of instructions that have given us boundless strength! It is your daring to struggle and daring to win, your great revolutionary practice, that inspires us to forge ahead bravely!

Dear Chairman Mao! At the critical moment of the struggle between the two lines, the heroic People's Liberation Army, personally created and led by you and directly commanded by Vice Chairman Lin, enthusiastically propagandized your brilliant thoughts, making our hearts red and our bones hard, and our fighting spirit soaring. The beloved PLA, firmly supporting the broad masses of the left, stands the most steadfast and holds the brightest banner; the beloved PLA, wholeheartedly serving the people, fearing neither hardships nor bloodshed; the beloved PLA, is a great army, a steel wall, and has made immortal contributions to the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution!

Dear Chairman Mao! The decision of the Central Committee on the Hunan issue, which you personally approved, like a thunderclap that shakes the earth, has brought a spring of blooming flowers. The bourgeois reactionary line has been completely defeated, and the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in Hunan has achieved decisive victory!

In September 1967, this most unforgettable day! Golden sunlight bathed the earth, and the maple forests of Yuelu Mountain were ablaze with red. You inspected the south of the Yangtze River and came among us again. “Chairman Mao has come! Chairman Mao has returned! Chairman Mao has given us the latest instructions!” The great news spread, and the whole province was in jubilation. This is your greatest concern, greatest education, and greatest encouragement for us! We shouted: Long live Chairman Mao! Long live! Ten thousand years! Ten thousand years! Dearest Chairman Mao, you are always with us heart to heart. Your latest instructions are words that speak to our hearts, and we will implement them without delay or deviation.

Dear Chairman Mao, you taught us: “All reactionary forces, when they are about to perish, will always make desperate struggles.” Just as we were closely following your great strategic deployment and fully implementing your latest instructions, the Chinese Khrushchev and the counter-revolutionary two-faced traitor Tao Zhu’s henchmen, the great ambitious military clique of Peng Dehuai, the remnants of the Kuomintang reactionaries, and the American-Kuomintang spies, with various reactionary currents, attempted to overthrow the proletarian dictatorship. Under the wise instructions of the proletarian headquarters headed by you, the heroic sons and daughters of your hometown, with clear minds and spirits, have swept this handful of social scum into the garbage heap of history.

Dear Chairman Mao! Turning the pages of Hunan's revolutionary struggle history, which chapter does not shine with the brilliant light of your great thoughts! Looking back on the decades of revolutionary fighting, the sons and daughters of your hometown deeply understand this great truth: Loyalty to you is revolution; following you is victory!

“Navigating the sea relies on the helmsman, making revolution relies on Mao Zedong Thought.”

Dear Chairman Mao! We will definitely take your close comrade-in-arms, Vice Chairman Lin, as a shining example, and forever be loyal to you. We are determined to read your books, listen to your words, and act according to your instructions for life. We will insist on using your brilliant thoughts as the banner in all fields, achieve the revolutionization of people's thoughts, and hold high the great red flag of your brilliant thoughts, vowing to make your hometown a bright red school of Mao Zedong Thought.

Dear Chairman Mao! We will definitely take your close comrade-in-arms, Vice Chairman Lin, as a shining example, and study and apply your great thoughts actively. We are determined to focus on “criticizing the self and criticizing revisionism” as the key, and take “Three Articles” as our motto, and run the study classes of your brilliant thoughts even better. We will fight against the bourgeois “self,” establish the proletarian “public,” and vow to be revolutionary proletarians who will carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to the end.

Dear Chairman Mao! We will definitely take your close comrade-in-arms, Vice Chairman Lin, as a shining example, and never forget class struggle, never forget the dictatorship of the proletariat. We will carry out a deep and sustained revolutionary criticism, thoroughly criticize, expose, and overthrow the clique of capitalists headed by the Chinese Khrushchev and their agents in Hunan, such as Wang Yanchun, and completely eliminate the poison of revisionism they spread. We will smash the attacks from the right or the “ultra-left” at any time, strike down the rightist wind of rehabilitation, and defend with our lives the proletarian headquarters headed by you! Defend with our lives your proletarian revolutionary line! Defend with our lives the Central Cultural Revolution Group! We will be highly vigilant against the attacks of the bourgeois sugar-coated shells, grasp power and use power according to the principles of proletarian party nature, and make the revolutionary committee, in the struggle, continuously improve and consolidate, become a battle command center that holds high your great red flag of brilliant thoughts, closely connects with the masses, leads the people of the whole province to attack the class enemies, closely follows your great strategic deployment, and seizes the comprehensive victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in thought, politics, economy, and organization!

Most sincerely, we wish you, our great teacher, great leader, great helmsman, and our brightest red sun in our hearts, eternal life! Eternal life!

    湖南省革命委员会成立和庆祝大会
    给毛主席的致敬电最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席：
    今天，您家乡的三千八百万英雄儿女，怀着万分激动的心情，向您，我们心中最红最红的红太阳，报告一个振奋人心的喜讯：在您一系列最新指示的光辉照耀下，在阶级斗争的疾风暴雨中，湖南省革命委员会胜利地诞生了！
    洞庭波涌连天雪，长岛人歌动地诗。
      毛主席啊，毛主席！在这大喜大庆的日子里，我们纵情欢呼您光辉思想的伟大胜利！从洞庭湖滨到五岭山下，从湘东革命老根据地到湘西侗寨苗乡，千万张笑脸迎着红太阳，千万颗红心飞向您身旁。我们衷心地祝愿，祝愿您老人家万寿无疆！万寿无疆！
      “东方红，太阳升，中国出了个毛泽东。”英雄的湖南，是全国人民和全世界人民一心向往的革命圣地。
      敬爱的毛主席，在那“百年魔怪舞翩跹”的黑暗年代里，是您，组织马列主义研究会，成立共产主义小组，亲手缔造和培育了伟大的中国共产党。
      是您，以无产阶级革命家的雄才大略，冲破旧世界的千重锁链，亲自率领长沙泥木工人大罢工，发出了“劳工万岁”的震天动地的声音，敲响了旧中国的丧钟！
      是您，一双草鞋，一把雨伞，踏遍三湘四水，深入工农群众，写下不朽的《湖南农民运动考察报告》，解决了无产阶级领导权的中心问题——农民同盟军问题，第一次提出了关于建立无产阶级领导的农民武装和农民政权的伟大战略思想。
      是您，高举武装斗争的革命旗帜，在蒋介石向革命人民举起屠刀，陈独秀、中国赫鲁晓夫跪倒在敌人脚下，合伙扼杀革命的危急关头，亲自领导秋收起义，缔造第一支人民武装，建立井冈山红色根据地，为中国革命开创了农村包围城市、武装夺取政权的唯一正确道路！
      毛主席啊，毛主席！您率领着我们踏遍万水千山，转战大江南北，打败日本强盗，埋葬蒋家王朝；您率领着我们缚苍龙，征腐恶；您率领着我们起宏图，换新天。
      我们跟着您，掀起了农村的社会主义高潮！
      我们跟着您，擂响了大跃进的战鼓！
      我们跟着您，坚持和捍卫社会主义的方向，粉碎了中国赫鲁晓夫的反革命修正主义路线，巩固了城乡社会主义阵地！
      毛主席啊，毛主席！您天才地总结了国际和国内无产阶级专政的历史经验，提出了无产阶级专政下进行革命的一整套理论、路线、方针、方法和政策，以最伟大的无产阶级革命家的气魄和胆略，亲自发动和领导了史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命，开创了国际共产主义运动的新纪元。
      敬爱的毛主席！湖南历来是革命与反革命激烈搏斗的重要战场。中国赫鲁晓夫为首的党内最大的一小撮走资派，长期以来在湖南安插亲信，培植爪牙，大力推行反革命修正主义路线，妄图把湖南变成复辟资本主义的重要据点。无限忠于您的湖南工人阶级、红卫兵小将和广大无产阶级革命派，坚决响应您《炮打司令部》的伟大战斗号令，怀着对阶级敌人的深仇大恨，高举无产阶级“造反有理”的大旗，冲破了资产阶级反动路线的重重围剿，向资产阶级司令部发动了一次又一次猛烈攻击，粉碎了资本主义复辟逆流，把中国赫鲁晓夫及其在湖南的代理人王延春之流，打得落花流水，全线崩溃。
      毛主席啊，毛主席！在两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的生死搏斗中，是您的一系列最新指示，给了我们无穷无尽的力量！是您敢于斗争、敢于胜利的伟大革命实践，激励着我们奋勇前进！
      敬爱的毛主席！在两条路线斗争的紧要关头，您亲自缔造和领导的、林副主席直接指挥的英雄的人民解放军，热情宣传您的光辉思想，使我们心红骨硬，斗志旺盛。亲人解放军，坚决支持左派广大群众，立场最坚定，旗帜最鲜明；亲人解放军，全心全意为人民，不怕艰难困苦，不怕流血牺牲；亲人解放军，是伟大的军队，钢铁的长城，为无产阶级文化大革命立下了不朽的功勋！
    敬爱的毛主席！您亲自批准的中央关于湖南问题的若干决定，象一声震撼大地的惊雷，迎来了百花盛开的春天。资产阶级反动路线彻底破产了，湖南的无产阶级文化大革命取得了决定性胜利！
      一九六七年九月间，这个最最难忘的时日啊！金色的阳光洒满大地，岳麓山的枫林一片火红。您巡视大江南北，又来到了我们中间。“毛主席来了！毛主席回来了！毛主席给我们作了最新指示！”特大喜讯传开，全省一片欢腾。这是您对我们的最大关怀，最大教育，最大鞭策！我们高呼：毛主席万岁！万岁！万万岁！最最敬爱的毛主席啊，您永远和我们心连心，您的最新指示，字字句句说在我们的心坎上，我们条条落实不迟疑，句句照办不走样。
    敬爱的毛主席，您教导我们：“一切反动势力在他们行将灭亡的时候，总是要进行垂死挣扎的。”正当我们紧跟您的伟大战略部署，全面落实您的最新指示的时候，中国赫鲁晓夫和反革命两面派陶铸的爪牙，大野心家彭德怀军阀的死党，勾结国民党反动派的残渣余孽和美蒋特务，他们以各种形色的反动思潮，妄图颠覆无产阶级专政。在以您为首的无产阶级司令部的英明指示下，您家乡的英雄儿女，心明眼亮，精神抖擞，把这一小撮社会渣滓扫进了历史的垃圾堆。
      敬爱的毛主席啊！翻开湖南的革命斗争史册，哪一章不闪耀着您伟大思想的灿烂光辉！回顾几十年的革命战斗历程，您家乡儿女深深地懂得这样一个伟大真理：忠于您，就是革命；跟着您，就是胜利！
      “大海航行靠舵手，干革命靠毛泽东思想。”
      敬爱的毛主席！我们一定以您的亲密战友林副主席为光辉榜样，永远忠于您。我们决心一辈子读您的书，听您的话，照您的指示办事，做您的好战士。我们要坚持在一切领域中用您的光辉思想挂帅，实现人的思想革命化，把您的光辉思想的伟大红旗高举更高举，誓把您的家乡办成红彤彤的毛泽东思想大学校。
      敬爱的毛主席！我们一定以您的亲密战友林副主席为光辉榜样，活学活用您的伟大思想，在“用”字上狠下功夫。我们决心以“斗私，批修”为纲，以“老三篇”为座右铭，把学习您光辉思想的学习班办得好上加好。我们要狠斗资产阶级“私”字，大立无产阶级“公”字，誓做决心把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底的无产阶级革命派。
      敬爱的毛主席！我们一定以您的亲密战友林副主席为光辉榜样，念念不忘阶级斗争，念念不忘无产阶级专政。深入持久地开展革命大批判，把中国赫鲁晓夫为首的党内最大一小撮走资派及其在湖南的代理人王延春之流，批深批透批倒批臭，彻底肃清他们散布的修正主义毒素。我们要随时粉碎阶级敌人来自右的方面或极“左”方面的进攻，痛击右倾翻案妖风，誓死保卫以您为首的无产阶级司令部！誓死保卫您的无产阶级革命路线！誓死保卫中央文革！我们要高度警惕资产阶级糖衣炮弹的袭击，按照无产阶级党性原则掌好权，用好权，使革命委员会在斗争中不断完善和巩固，成为高举您的光辉思想伟大红旗，密切联系群众，领导全省人民向阶级敌人进攻的战斗司令部，紧跟您的伟大战略部署，从思想上、政治上、经济上、组织上夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利！
      最最衷心地祝愿您啊，我们伟大的导师、伟大的领袖、伟大的统帅、伟大的舵手，我们心中最红最红的红太阳，万寿无疆！万寿无疆！
                      湖南省革命委员会成立和庆祝大会
                                          一九六八年四月八日
