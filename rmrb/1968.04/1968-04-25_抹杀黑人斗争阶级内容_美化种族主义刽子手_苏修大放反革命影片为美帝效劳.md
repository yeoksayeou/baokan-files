According to a report from the New China News Agency on the 23rd, Moscow: The Soviet revisionist renegade clique has directed their movie theaters and television stations to screen counter-revolutionary films that erase the class struggle content in the black people's fight and glorify U.S. imperialism.

According to reports, a movie theater in Moscow recently screened a documentary film titled "Facing Racism" that propagates "class cooperation." To deceive the audience, the Soviet revisionist clique's mouthpiece, Tass, created public opinion beforehand, hyping up the film as supposedly "exposing racism," and so on. In reality, this film completely erases the class struggle content in the black people's fight and strives to cover up the essence of racial discrimination. The film, with ulterior motives, starts from a purely "academic" (anthropological) perspective, extensively discussing the origins of humanity (from apes to humans), changes in human brain types, and so on. However, it does not discuss class, class contradictions, and class struggle at all, avoiding the fact that racial discrimination is a product of colonialism and imperialism, covering up the class contradictions between the broad masses of black people and the ruling class, and concealing the fundamental differences between the white ruling class that exploits and oppresses black people and the broad laboring masses of white people who have common interests and common struggle goals with the black people. Moreover, the film glorifies the U.S. imperialist leader Johnson, extensively showing footage of this chief culprit who brutally suppresses the black people's struggle in the United States. The film also praises the American bourgeois politician and former U.S. President Kennedy's brother, Robert Kennedy, shamelessly showcasing his "opposition" to racial discrimination.

It is particularly worth noting that this counter-revolutionary film by the Soviet revisionists was produced under the "invitation" of American "professors" and is also a product of Soviet-American cultural "cooperation."

Additionally, the Soviet revisionist central television station also broadcasted an "artistic" film titled "The Road of Thunder" on the evening of the 18th. This film, from a bourgeois reactionary standpoint, removes the class content and repeatedly advocates that black and white people should be "friendly." The Soviet revisionist clique's screening of this film is entirely to serve the American ruling class in politically deceiving the black masses.

    抹杀黑人斗争阶级内容　美化种族主义刽子手
    苏修大放反革命影片为美帝效劳
    据新华社二十三日讯　莫斯科消息：苏修叛徒集团竟指使他们的电影院和电视台，放映抹杀黑人斗争的阶级内容、美化美帝的反革命影片。
    据报道，莫斯科一家电影院最近上映了一部宣扬“阶级合作”的纪录影片《面对种族主义》。为了欺骗观众，苏修集团喉舌塔斯社在事前就大造舆论，极力吹捧这部影片是所谓“揭露种族主义的”等等。而事实上，这部影片完全抹杀了黑人斗争的阶级内容，竭力掩盖种族歧视的实质。影片别有用心地从纯“学术”（人类学）的角度出发，大谈特谈人类的起源（由猿变人）、人的脑型的变化等，但却根本不谈阶级、阶级矛盾和阶级斗争，回避种族歧视是殖民主义、帝国主义制度的产物，掩盖广大黑人和统治集团之间存在着的阶级矛盾，掩饰剥削、压迫黑人的白人统治集团和与广大黑人有着共同利益和共同斗争目标的白人中的广大劳动人民之间存在着的根本区别。不但如此，影片还美化美帝头子约翰逊，大量映出这个血腥镇压美国黑人斗争的罪魁祸首的镜头。影片并且吹捧美国资产阶级政客、美国前总统肯尼迪的弟弟罗伯特·肯尼迪，无耻地标榜他“反对”种族歧视的镜头。
    需要特别指出的是，苏修的这部反革命影片，是在“邀请”美国“教授”“参加”下炮制出来的，它也是苏美文化“合作”的产物。
    此外，苏修中央电视台在十八日晚还放映了一部名为《雷电的道路》的“艺术”影片，这部影片完全从资产阶级反动立场出发，抽掉阶级内容，一个劲地鼓吹黑人和白人应该“友好”，苏修集团放映这部影片完全是为美国统治集团实行对黑人群众的政治欺骗效劳。
