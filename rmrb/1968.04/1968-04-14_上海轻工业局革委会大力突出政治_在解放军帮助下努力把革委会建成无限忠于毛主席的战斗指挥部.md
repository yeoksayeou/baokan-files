The revolutionary committee of the Shanghai Light Industry Bureau, with the enthusiastic assistance of the propaganda team of the People's Liberation Army stationed in Shanghai, is striving to build the committee into a revolutionary command center that is absolutely loyal to Chairman Mao. The committee is committed to high political standards, adhering to the principle of "criticize and repudiate revisionism and self-criticism" and emphasizing proletarian politics.

Chairman Mao has taught us, "After the political line is determined, cadres are the decisive factor," and "A change in worldview is a fundamental change." After the establishment of the Shanghai Light Industry Bureau Revolutionary Committee, many members felt that their revolutionary responsibilities had increased and vowed to study and apply Chairman Mao's thoughts more diligently, focusing on the "application" aspect to transform their worldviews. However, some members felt overwhelmed by the heavy responsibilities and numerous tasks, believing they could not handle them. Some old cadres feared taking risks and making mistakes again. Facing these active thoughts, the propaganda team members and the committee leaders first studied Comrade Lin Biao's directive on the leadership cadre being the power, deeply recognizing that the committee must have a revolutionary leadership cadre that is absolutely loyal to Chairman Mao, absolutely loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, and absolutely loyal to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line to wield power correctly. These active thoughts reflect the "self" and are obstacles to the committee's correct use of power. Therefore, the propaganda team members and the committee members, with these active thoughts in mind, studied and applied the "Three Articles" extensively, criticizing and repudiating revisionism and self-criticism. They repeatedly studied Chairman Mao's teachings, "All our cadres, regardless of their rank, are servants of the people," recognizing that being a committee member or a standing committee member, in the bureau or at the grassroots level, is to serve the people. During the self-criticism sessions, everyone voluntarily sought issues from the two-line struggle, found gaps in their loyalty, and delved into the root causes in their souls. Old cadres criticized their fears, replacing them with the thought of daring to take on heavy responsibilities for the revolution and not fearing mistakes. New cadres criticized their selfishness, establishing the thought of being good servants of the people for the revolution. Everyone expressed their determination to do a good job in the committee's work with their loyalty to Chairman Mao. The committee's director, Wang Wenli, originally a deputy director, now the first in command, had the thought that his abilities were low and he could not handle the job. After studying, he realized that daring to take on heavy responsibilities for the new revolutionary committee was a matter of loyalty to Chairman Mao. Thus, he decided to take on the heavy responsibilities. Many new cadres also said, "Our positions have changed, but our red hearts to serve the people wholeheartedly cannot change; our responsibilities have increased, but our revolutionary spirit as proletarian revolutionaries cannot change."

Loyalty to Chairman Mao means holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and promoting unity within the committee. To become a revolutionary and unified fighting entity, the committee must ensure that every leader is absolutely loyal to the great leader Chairman Mao. Initially, when new and old cadres were combined, some old cadres were not bold enough in their work and dared not criticize and help new cadres with their shortcomings and errors. Some new cadres lacked leadership experience and were not respectful or trusting enough of old cadres. Some new cadres still stood on the ground of their original mass organizations, speaking and doing things with factionalism. The propaganda team members, together with them, studied Chairman Mao's teachings on strengthening unity and the "Work Methods of the Party Committee," overcoming bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism, enhancing proletarian party spirit, and strengthening the collective leadership concept, uniting everyone's thoughts and actions into one. Sometimes, when there were disagreements among committee members on certain issues, the PLA comrades would promptly help them hold heart-to-heart meetings, small group discussions, and engage in heart-to-heart talks, further enhancing unity among the committee members. Everyone deeply felt that only by being absolutely loyal to Chairman Mao could the leadership cadre continue to revolutionize; only by using Mao Zedong Thought as the guiding principle for all the committee's work could they lead the broad revolutionary masses to continue advancing.

The great leader Chairman Mao teaches us, "Political work is the lifeline of all economic work." After the establishment of the committee, everyone felt overwhelmed by the myriad of tasks, leading to a chaotic situation where work was unclear. The propaganda team members, following the great leader Chairman Mao's teachings and Comrade Lin Biao's series of directives on emphasizing proletarian politics, guided everyone to link theory with practice and thoughts, extensively discussing the benefits of emphasizing proletarian politics and the bitterness of emphasizing business. During the sharing sessions, the propaganda team members also, through their personal experiences, criticized and exposed the crimes of the counter-revolutionary revisionist Ro Ruiqing in promoting bourgeois military lines and poisoning themselves. An old cadre recalled his past mistakes due to not emphasizing politics, saying, "Mao Zedong Thought is the soul of the revolution. Without Mao Zedong Thought, all efforts are in vain." Many comrades said, "Is the committee led by Mao Zedong Thought or by business? This is a matter of direction and path." They vowed to overcome all difficulties and interference, using Mao Zedong Thought to guide everything. Through study, everyone first placed the active study and application of Mao Zedong Thought in a position higher than everything, greater than everything, prior to everything, and more important than everything. The Standing Committee, when arranging, checking, and summarizing work, first arranged the active study and application of Chairman Mao's works, checked and summarized the situation of active study and application of Chairman Mao's works. All units in the bureau set up Mao Zedong Thought study classes. For a period, in supporting the construction of other regions, proletarian politics were not emphasized, resulting in poor work and complaints from the masses. They deeply felt from practice, "The more work there is, the more need there is for study; the busier the affairs, the more the fundamentals need to be grasped. Anything, at any time, must put emphasizing proletarian politics in the first place."

The propaganda team of the Shanghai Light Industry Bureau recognized that firmly grasping class struggle is the greatest emphasis on proletarian politics. Whether the committee grasps class struggle is a big issue related to whether the new committee can be continuously consolidated and advanced. After the committee's establishment, the revolutionary and production situation in the entire bureau was excellent. However, the struggle between the two classes, the two roads, and the two lines had not ended, and the poison spread by the Chinese Khrushchev and a handful of capitalist roaders within the party had not been eliminated. The propaganda team members often propagated Chairman Mao's statements on class and class struggle and the great theory, line, principles, and policies of continuing the revolution under the dictatorship of the proletariat, helping the committee to use class analysis methods to analyze the current class struggle situation, actively and proactively launching attacks on class enemies. A grassroots unit had its leadership usurped by bad elements, and they assisted the committee and the masses in seizing back the leadership from the bad elements, using this as a typical case to educate everyone to enhance their class struggle awareness and vigilance. At the same time, they actively assisted various units in carrying out revolutionary criticism, eliminating the poison of revisionism spread by the Chinese Khrushchev and a handful of capitalist roaders within the party. The struggle, criticism, and reform in various units were carried out more deeply.

The great leader Chairman Mao teaches us, "In the future, cadres should go down to the grassroots to walk around, see for themselves, and adhere to the mass line, consulting with the masses on everything and being students of the masses." The PLA comrades and the committee members, following Chairman Mao's teachings, often went deep into the grassroots and among the masses. In the process of promoting the implementation of the revolutionary three-in-one combination throughout the bureau, most standing committee members personally went to the front lines, studying and implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions with the masses. Some standing committee members, to help grassroots units quickly implement the revolutionary three-in-one combination, worked day and night, going where the difficulties were the most. The leaders of this bureau tasted the sweetness of being among the masses. Now, out of the thirty-nine committee members of this bureau, twenty are constantly working at the grassroots level. They study, struggle, and work with the broad masses, keeping the committee closely connected with the masses.

Since its establishment, with the active assistance of the propaganda team of the People's Liberation Army stationed in the bureau, the committee has firmly adhered to the path of emphasizing proletarian politics, firmly grasped the thought revolutionization of the leadership cadre, and the revolutionary nature and authority of the committee have been further enhanced. They actively led the broad masses, closely following Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, quickly launching a new high tide of studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought, and the revolutionary and production situation of the entire system was getting better day by day.

    上海轻工业局革委会大力突出政治
    在解放军帮助下努力把革委会建成无限忠于毛主席的战斗指挥部
    据新华社上海十二日电　解放军某部驻上海市轻工业局毛泽东思想宣传组热情帮助这个局革委会成员高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，以“斗私，批修”为纲，走突出无产阶级政治的道路，把革委会建设成为无限忠于毛主席的革命化的密切联系群众的战斗指挥部。
    毛主席教导我们：“政治路线确定之后，干部就是决定的因素”，“世界观的转变是一个根本的转变”。上海市轻工业局革命委员会建立后，许多成员深深感到自己的革命责任更重了，表示要更加努力活学活用毛泽东思想，在“用”字上狠下功夫，努力改造世界观。但也有少数成员认为担子重，工作头绪多，干不了；有的老干部怕担风险，怕再犯错误。面对这些活思想，毛泽东思想宣传组的同志和革委会领导成员首先学习了林副主席的领导班子就是政权的指示，深刻地认识到，革委会要掌好权，用好权，必须有一个无限忠于毛主席、无限忠于毛泽东思想、无限忠于毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的革命化的领导班子。这些活思想就是“私”字的反映，是革委会掌好权、用好权的障碍。于是，宣传组的同志和革委会成员一起带着这些活思想，大学大用“老三篇”，破私立公。他们反复学习了毛主席“我们一切工作干部，不论职位高低，都是人民的勤务员”的教导，认识到当委员，当常委，在局里，在基层，都是为人民服务。在斗私批修会上，大家自觉地从两条路线斗争中找问题，在“忠”字上找差距，在灵魂深处找原因。老干部狠斗了怕字，换上了为革命敢挑重担，不怕犯错误的思想；新干部狠斗了私心，树立了为革命当好人民勤务员的思想。大家表示：要用对毛主席的忠心，把革委会的工作做好。局革委会主任王文锐，原是副局长，现在当第一把手，产生了能力低，干不了的想法。经过学习，他认识到，敢不敢为新生的革委会挑重担，这是对毛主席忠不忠的大节问题。于是，他下决心挑好重担子。许多新干部也说：“我们地位变了，全心全意为人民服务的一颗红心不能变；责任重了，无产阶级革命派的革命精神不能变。”
    忠于毛主席，就要高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，搞好革委会的团结。革委会要成为一个革命化的战斗整体，必须使革委会每个领导成员都无限忠于伟大领袖毛主席。开始，新老干部刚结合到一块时，有的老干部工作不够大胆，对新干部的缺点错误不敢开展批评帮助，有的新干部缺乏领导经验，对老干部不够尊重，不够信任；有的新干部之间还自觉不自觉地站在原来自己群众组织一派的立场上，讲带有派性的话，做带有派性的事。宣传组的同志同他们一起学习毛主席关于加强团结的教导和《党委会的工作方法》，克服资产阶级、小资产阶级派性，增强无产阶级党性，加强大家的集体领导观念，从思想上、行动上把全“班”拧成一股绳。有时，委员之间在某些问题上发生分歧时，解放军同志就及时帮助他们召开交心会、碰头会，开展谈心活动，进一步增进了革委会成员之间的团结。大家深深体会到：只有无限忠于毛主席，才能使领导班子不断革命化；只有用毛泽东思想作为革委会的一切工作的指导方针，才能带领广大革命群众不断前进。
    伟大领袖毛主席教导我们：“政治工作是一切经济工作的生命线。”局革委会建立以后，大家感到事情千头万绪，一度出现了忙乱现象，工作不知从何着手。宣传组的同志遵照伟大领袖毛主席的教导和林副主席关于突出无产阶级政治的一系列指示，引导大家联系实际，联系思想，大谈突出无产阶级政治的甜头，突出业务的苦头。宣传组同志在讲用会上，还以亲身的经历控诉批判了反革命修正主义分子罗瑞卿突出技术，推行资产阶级军事路线对自己毒害的罪行。一个老干部回顾自己过去由于不突出政治所犯错误的教训说：“毛泽东思想是革命的灵魂，离开了毛泽东思想，千忙万忙等于瞎忙。”许多同志说：革委会是坚持毛泽东思想挂帅，还是业务挂帅？这是坚持什么方向，走什么道路的问题。他们表示一定克服一切困难，排除一切干扰，用毛泽东思想统帅一切。通过学习，大家首先把活学活用毛泽东思想放在高于一切，大于一切，先于一切，重于一切的位置上。常委会在布置、检查、总结工作时，首先布置活学活用毛主席著作，检查、总结活学活用毛主席著作的情况。全局各个单位都办起了毛泽东思想学习班。有一段时间，在支援其他地区建设上，没有突出无产阶级政治，结果，工作没有做好，群众有意见。他们从实践中深深体会到：“工作越多越需要学习，事务越忙越要狠抓根本。任何事情，任何时候，都要把突出无产阶级政治放在第一位。”
    上海轻工业局毛泽东思想宣传组认识到，狠抓阶级斗争，就是最大的突出无产阶级政治。革委会抓不抓阶级斗争是关系到新生的革委会能不能不断巩固和不断前进的大问题。革委会成立以后，全局革命、生产形势一片大好。但是，两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的斗争并没有结束，中国赫鲁晓夫及党内一小撮走资派散布的流毒还没有肃清。宣传组的同志就经常地宣传毛主席关于阶级、阶级斗争的论述和无产阶级专政条件下继续进行革命的伟大理论、路线、方针和政策，帮助革委会用阶级分析的方法，分析当前阶级斗争的形势，积极主动地向阶级敌人发起进攻。一个基层单位被坏人篡夺了领导权，他们就协助革委会和广大群众从坏人手里夺回了领导权，又以此为典型教育大家提高阶级斗争观念和阶级警惕性。与此同时，又积极协助各单位开展革命的大批判，肃清中国赫鲁晓夫及党内一小撮走资派散布的修正主义的流毒。各单位的斗、批、改也更加深入地开展起来了。
    伟大领袖毛主席教导我们：“以后干部要分别到下面去走一走，看一看，要坚持群众路线，遇事多和群众商量，做群众的小学生。”解放军同志和革委会成员遵照毛主席的教导，经常深入基层，深入群众。在促进全局实现革命三结合的过程中，多数常委都亲临第一线，同群众一起学习和落实毛主席的最新指示。有的常委为了帮助基层单位尽快实现革命三结合，昼夜奋战，那里困难最多就到那里去。这个局的领导成员在深入群众中尝到了甜头。现在这个局的革委会三十九个委员中有二十个经常在基层工作。他们和广大群众学习在一起，斗争在一起，工作在一起，使革委会保持了与群众的密切联系。
    这个局革委会成立以来，在驻局毛泽东思想宣传组同志的积极帮助下，由于坚持了走突出无产阶级政治的道路，狠抓了领导班子的思想革命化，革委会的革命性和权威性有了进一步提高。他们积极带领广大群众，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，迅速掀起了活学活用毛泽东思想的新高潮，全系统的革命和生产形势一天比一天好。
