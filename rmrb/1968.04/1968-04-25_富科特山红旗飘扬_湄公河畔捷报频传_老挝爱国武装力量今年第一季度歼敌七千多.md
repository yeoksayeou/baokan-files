The Lao Patriotic Armed Forces have achieved a significant victory by eliminating over 7,200 enemy forces in the first quarter of this year across various battlefields. This number is double the amount from the same period last year, with 3,194 enemies killed alone. Additionally, the Lao Patriotic Armed Forces have shot down or destroyed 61 American aircraft, sunk multiple enemy combat boats, burned down several enemy ammunition and fuel depots, and seized approximately 2,200 weapons of various kinds.

The report states that the Lao Patriotic Armed Forces started the year with a series of victories. From January 12 to 26, they launched fierce attacks on the strategic locations in the upper Laos region, particularly in Nam Bao, eliminating 2,938 enemies and liberating a vast area with a population of over 10,000 people.

In February and March, the Lao Patriotic Armed Forces continued their advances, achieving a series of brilliant victories in provinces such as Xieng Khouang, Saravane, Attapeu, and Sam Neua. They liberated areas like Mang Xay, Tat Tong, and Tat Veng in Xieng Khouang Province, forcing the enemy to abandon dozens of outposts around Saravane, Attapeu, and Tchepone. In Sam Neua Province, the Lao Patriotic Armed Forces completely destroyed several major enemy bases in the Baty region, liberating over 10,000 people from the enemy's brutal rule.

Under the heavy blows from the Lao Patriotic Armed Forces, the morale of the right-wing military has plummeted. Hundreds of right-wing soldiers and American-backed bandits have fled or surrendered to the patriotic military and people. Units such as the 13th, 14th, and 15th battalions of the right-wing military have seen their combat effectiveness severely weakened due to frequent desertions. Many enemy guards, fearing the attacks from the Lao Patriotic Armed Forces, have abandoned their outposts and fled.

The Lao Patriotic Armed Forces in Savannakhet Province, along with the guerrilla forces and militias, on March 27, in a counterattack against American air pirates, shot down one American aircraft, killed three American pilots, and seized a large number of weapons and other military supplies.

    富科特山红旗飘扬　湄公河畔捷报频传
    老挝爱国武装力量今年第一季度歼敌七千多
    新华社康开电　据巴特寮通讯社报道，老挝爱国武装力量今年第一季度在各个战场上勇猛打击敌人，取得了歼敌七千二百多名的巨大胜利。
    老挝爱国武装力量今年第一季度歼敌人数，比去年同期增加一倍，其中单单打死的就达三千一百九十四人。此外，老挝爱国武装力量还击落、击毁美国飞机六十一架，击沉敌人战斗艇多艘，焚毁敌人军火库和汽油库多座，缴获各种武器约两千二百件。
    报道说，老挝爱国武装力量在今年年初就旗开得胜。他们从一月十二日到二十六日，接连猛烈袭击上寮地区的战略要地南博，共歼敌两千九百三十八人，解放了拥有一万多人口的广大地区。
    二月份和三月份，老挝爱国武装力量乘胜前进，在川圹、沙拉湾、阿速坡以及桑怒等省又先后打了一系列漂亮的胜仗，解放了川圹省的芒岸、塔通和塔文等地，迫使敌人放弃了沙拉湾、阿速坡和他曲周围的几十个据点。在桑怒省，老挝爱国武装力量彻底摧毁了巴提地区敌人的一些主要基地，使一万多人从敌人的残酷统治下获得了解放。
    在老挝爱国武装力量的沉重打击下，右派军队士气日益低落，数百名右派军队士兵和美国豢养的匪徒逃跑或向爱国军民缴械投诚。右派军队的第十三、十四和十五营等单位，由于士兵不断开小差，战斗力严重削弱。许多守敌慑于老挝爱国武装力量的打击，纷纷放弃哨所逃命。
    新华社康开电　据巴特寮通讯社报道，老挝沙湾拿吉省游击队和民兵，三月二十七日在反击美国空中强盗的战斗中，击落美机一架，打死美国飞贼三名，缴获许多武器和其他军用物资。
