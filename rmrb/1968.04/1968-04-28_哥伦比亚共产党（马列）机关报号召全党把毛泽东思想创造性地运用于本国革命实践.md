The organ of the Communist Party of Colombia (Marxist-Leninist), *Revolutionary News*, in its 24th issue, published an editorial calling on the entire party to combine the specific conditions of the country and creatively apply Mao Zedong Thought to the revolutionary practice of Colombia.

The editorial, titled "Elevate the Principle Position of Mao Zedong Thought within Our Party," states: Since the appearance of the scientific ideology of the proletariat, Marxism, in history and in various eras, Marxism has had its most outstanding interpreters.

Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin are the true genius leaders of the proletariat. They have transcended the boundaries of their own peoples and nations in their respective eras to become leaders of the world revolution and the proletariat. They are the teachers of the revolutionary peoples of the world.

Today, the greatest Marxist-Leninist of the contemporary era, Comrade Mao Zedong, lives with us. This is the happiness of all humanity and the greatest hope of all oppressed peoples of the world. Comrade Mao Zedong's thought is the contemporary Marxism-Leninism, ensuring the victory and development of the struggle for liberation of the peoples of all countries against international imperialism led by American imperialism, revisionism, and the reactionaries of all countries.

The editorial points out: Mao Zedong Thought is the great red beacon guiding the revolutionary masses of the world. Mao Zedong Thought belongs not only to China but to the peoples of all countries.

Comrade Lin Biao, the close comrade-in-arms of Mao Zedong, said:

"Comrade Mao Zedong is the greatest Marxist-Leninist of the contemporary era. Comrade Mao Zedong has brilliantly, creatively, and comprehensively inherited, defended, and developed Marxism-Leninism, raising it to a new and higher stage.

"Mao Zedong Thought is the Marxism-Leninism of the era when imperialism is heading towards total collapse and socialism is advancing towards worldwide victory. Mao Zedong Thought is a powerful ideological weapon against imperialism, a powerful ideological weapon against revisionism and dogmatism. Mao Zedong Thought is the guiding principle for all the work of the Party, the army, and the entire nation.

"To truly master Mao Zedong Thought, one must repeatedly study the basic viewpoints of Chairman Mao. Some aphorisms should be memorized and repeatedly studied and applied.

"When Mao Zedong Thought is grasped by the broad masses, it will become an inexhaustible force, a spiritual atomic bomb of boundless power."

To make these basic views about Comrade Mao Zedong our own is an urgent need for the party, the proletariat, and the people of Colombia. Comrade Mao Zedong is the leader of the proletariat and the world revolution. Mao Zedong Thought is the great red banner waving in the wind, guiding the communist parties of all countries and the liberation movements of all oppressed masses.

The editorial states: The brilliant and creative development of Marxism-Leninism by Comrade Mao Zedong should become the guide for all our work and actions. Whatever we do, we must consciously and practically apply Mao Zedong Thought. Before undertaking any revolutionary task, we must be confident that this task conforms to the thoughts of Comrade Mao Zedong; after completing any task, we must use Mao Zedong Thought to verify this action. Only in this way can we be sure that we have not deviated from the true proletarian revolutionary line.

The editorial states: All party members, intermediate leadership bodies, and the Central Committee should seriously study the works of Comrade Mao Zedong; creatively apply Mao Zedong Thought to the specific conditions of our country. Only in this way can we reliably and sustainably ensure that we become the vanguard of the revolutionary proletariat, continue to lead the struggle victoriously, and ultimately defeat American imperialism and its local puppets—the big bourgeoisie and big landlords—to establish a people's dictatorship under the absolute leadership of the proletariat in our country, with all revolutionary classes and strata.

In the Central Committee's *Revolutionary News*, *Guidelines* magazine, and *Marxist-Leninist Thought*, as well as in all national, regional, or local party publications, we should, according to the actual situation, regularly publish quotations from Chairman Mao for party members and the general public to study and apply.

*The Quotations from Chairman Mao* is a concentrated and authoritative summary of contemporary Marxism-Leninism—Mao Zedong Thought, a guidebook. It is the first time in the history of Marxism that the most important Marxist propositions, viewpoints, and ideas have been collected in one work, clearly and scientifically. All communists, all revolutionaries, should have this guidebook and frequently consult it. We should make our party a big school of red Mao Zedong Thought.

The editorial points out: Comrade Mao Zedong is the leader of the proletariat and the world revolution, the greatest Marxist-Leninist of the contemporary era, the greatest revolutionary of the contemporary era, the Lenin of the contemporary era, our great teacher, great leader, great helmsman, and great navigator. This is a principle of our party.

Mao Zedong Thought is the highest expression of proletarian thought, a great red beacon illuminating the entire world, and the revolutionary guide for all the peoples of the world. This is another great principle of our party.

We should propagate these principles and elevate them to their due highest level. We should spread the works of Mao Zedong among workers, peasants, students, and the general public. We should promote and guide them to study the works of Mao Zedong according to the most urgent needs and the special circumstances of each period. We should strive for the majority of the people to master Mao Zedong Thought.

The editorial states: We should always be vigilant, maintain alertness, and use all our strength to defend the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, and counterattack any open or hidden enemies.

Whoever destroys these principles, whoever opposes the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, cannot be a member of the Communist Party of Colombia (Marxist-Leninist). On the contrary, he is an enemy of the party, an enemy of the revolution, an enemy of the Colombian people, an enemy of proletarian internationalism, and an enemy of all the peoples of the world. Our party should always be vigilant and resolutely expose and strike them.

The attitude towards Mao Zedong Thought is the criterion we use to distinguish Marxist-Leninists, proletarian revolutionaries from revisionists, other imperialist agents, and all pseudo-revolutionaries.

The editorial condemns the international imperialism led by American imperialism, modern revisionism centered on the leadership of the CPSU, and all the reactionaries of various countries for their wicked and despicable slanders and defamations against Mao Zedong Thought and the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution of China. The editorial emphasizes: They attempt to cover up the immense power of Mao Zedong Thought to the world. But they cannot. They tremble at the name of Mao Zedong. They are extremely afraid of Mao Zedong Thought.

The editorial states: American imperialism, in close collusion with Soviet revisionism and a small clique of capitalist-roaders in power in China led by the Chinese Khrushchev, is attempting to sabotage the proletarian dictatorship and restore capitalism in China.

However, Comrade Mao Zedong accurately discovered and pointed out the new characteristics of modern revisionism, the restoration of capitalism in the Soviet Union and other countries controlled by revisionism. He pointed out that in socialist countries, classes and class struggle still exist, and in China, there is the possibility of restoring capitalism and transforming the proletarian dictatorship into a bourgeois dictatorship.

To prevent the restoration of capitalism in China, to sweep away all monsters and demons in China, to smash the conspiracies of American imperialism, revisionism, and the reactionaries of various countries, to consolidate the proletarian dictatorship and ensure uninterrupted development towards socialism, Chairman Mao personally initiated and led the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China.

The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China is the most significant revolutionary event in human history. This revolution armed seven hundred million Chinese people with Mao Zedong Thought; this revolution is the largest mass mobilization in human history; it is the first great revolution initiated by the proletariat itself in a country under proletarian dictatorship; it is the greatest material and ideological force in the process of burying imperialism, revisionism, and the reactionaries of various countries; it is a brilliant new development of Marxism-Leninism by Chairman Mao.

The purpose of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China is to resolve the contradictions between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie and between socialism and capitalism.

The editorial points out: Mao Zedong Thought guarantees the proletarian dictatorship in China.

Mao Zedong Thought guarantees the socialist path in China.

Mao Zedong Thought ensures that China will never restore capitalism.

Mao Zedong Thought ensures that China will forever be red.

Mao Zedong Thought ensures the victory of the struggle against imperialism, revisionism, and the reactionaries of various countries.

Mao Zedong Thought is the great revolutionary guide for all the peoples of the world, ensuring the victory and development of their liberation struggles.

Mao Zedong Thought is the best guarantee for the establishment, development, and consolidation of the Communist Parties (Marxist-Leninist) of all countries.

Mao Zedong Thought is the great guide for our party.

The editorial concludes with a call: Long live the invincible great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought!

Long live our great teacher, great leader, great helmsman, and great navigator, Comrade Mao Zedong!

    哥伦比亚共产党（马列）机关报号召全党把毛泽东思想创造性地运用于本国革命实践
    新华社二十七日讯　波哥大消息：哥伦比亚共产党（马克思列宁主义）机关报《革命报》在第二十四期上发表社论，号召全党结合本国的具体条件，创造性地把毛泽东思想运用于哥伦比亚的革命实践。
    这篇题为《提高毛泽东思想在我们党内的原则地位》的社论说：自从无产阶级的科学思想马克思主义出现以来，在历史上和各个时代，马克思主义都有其最卓越的阐明者。
    马克思、恩格斯、列宁和斯大林是无产阶级的真正的天才领袖，他们都在自己所处的时代超越了自己人民和自己国家的界限，成为世界革命和无产阶级的领袖。他们是世界革命人民的导师。
    今天，当代最伟大的马克思列宁主义者毛泽东同志同我们生活在一起，这是全人类的幸福，是全世界一切被压迫人民的最大希望。毛泽东同志的思想是当代的马克思列宁主义，保证了各国人民反对以美帝国主义为首的国际帝国主义、修正主义和各国反动派的解放斗争的胜利发展。
    社论指出：毛泽东思想是指引世界革命群众的伟大的红色灯塔。毛泽东思想不仅属于中国，而且属于世界各国人民。
    毛泽东同志的亲密战友林彪同志说：
      “毛泽东同志是当代最伟大的马克思列宁主义者。毛泽东同志天才地、创造性地、全面地继承、捍卫和发展了马克思列宁主义，把马克思列宁主义提高到一个崭新的阶段。
      “毛泽东思想是在帝国主义走向全面崩溃，社会主义走向全世界胜利的时代的马克思列宁主义。毛泽东思想是反对帝国主义的强大的思想武器，是反对修正主义和教条主义的强大的思想武器。毛泽东思想是全党、全军和全国一切工作的指导方针。”
      “为了把毛泽东思想真正学到手，要反复学习毛主席的许多基本观点，有些警句最好要背熟，反复学习，反复运用。”
      “毛泽东思想为广大群众所掌握，就会变成无穷无尽的力量，变成威力无比的精神原子弹。”
    把对于毛泽东同志的这些基本看法变为我们自己的看法，这是哥伦比亚的党、无产阶级和人民的刻不容缓的需要。毛泽东同志是无产阶级和世界革命的领袖。毛泽东思想，是迎风招展的伟大红旗，引导着世界各国共产党，引导着所有被压迫群众的解放运动。
    社论说：毛泽东同志的天才地、创造性地发展了马克思列宁主义的著作，要成为我们一切工作、一切行动的指南。我们无论做什么事，都要依靠自觉地、切实地运用毛泽东思想。在进行每一项革命任务之前，我们都应该确有把握这项任务是符合毛泽东同志的思想的；在完成每项任务之后，我们也应该用毛泽东思想来检验这一行动。只有这样，我们才能确信自己没有脱离真正的无产阶级革命路线。
    社论说：全体党员、中层领导机构和中央委员会应该认真地学习毛泽东同志的著作；把毛泽东思想创造性地运用于我国的具体条件。唯有这样，才能持久可靠地保证我们成为革命的无产阶级先锋队，继续胜利地领导斗争，直到彻底打败美帝国主义和它在当地的傀儡——大资产阶级和大地主，在我国建立无产阶级绝对领导下的各革命阶级和革命阶层的人民专政。
    在中央委员会的《革命报》、《方针》杂志和《马列主义思想》上，以及在党的所有全国性的、地区性的或地方性的刊物上，都应该根据现实情况，经常刊登毛主席语录，供党员和一般人民学习和运用。
    《毛主席语录》这本红书，是当代马克思列宁主义——毛泽东思想的集中和权威性总结，是一部指南。把各方面最重要的马克思主义的论断、论点和观点，简明地、科学地收集在一部著作里，这在马克思主义历史上还是第一次。所有共产党人，所有革命者，都应该有这部指南，经常向这部著作请教。我们应该使我党成为一个红彤彤的毛泽东思想大学校。
    社论指出：毛泽东同志是无产阶级和世界革命的领袖，是当代最伟大的马克思列宁主义者，是当代最伟大的革命家，是当代的列宁，是我们伟大的导师、伟大的领袖、伟大的统帅、伟大的舵手，这是我党的一项原则。
    毛泽东思想是无产阶级思想的最高表现，是照亮全世界的巨大红色灯塔，是全世界人民的革命指南，这是我党的又一项伟大原则。
    我们应该宣传这些原则，并把这些原则提高到应有的最高水平。我们应该在工人中、农民中、学生中和普通群众中传播毛泽东著作。推动和引导他们根据最迫切的需要和每个时期的特殊情况学习毛泽东著作。争取大多数人民都掌握毛泽东思想。
    社论说：我们应该永远提高警惕，保持戒备，尽我们一切力量捍卫战无不胜的毛泽东思想，反击任何公开或暗藏的敌人。
    谁破坏这些原则，谁反对毛泽东思想伟大红旗，谁就不能当哥伦比亚共产党（马列）的党员。而且相反，他就是党的敌人、革命的敌人、哥伦比亚人民的敌人、无产阶级国际主义和全世界人民的敌人。我们党应该永远提高警惕，坚决地揭发和打击他们。
    对毛泽东思想的态度，是我们用以区别马克思列宁主义者、无产阶级革命者同修正主义者、其他帝国主义代理人以及一切假革命者的准绳。
    社论谴责以美帝国主义为首的国际帝国主义、以苏共领导集团为中心的现代修正主义和所有各国的反动派对毛泽东思想和中国无产阶级文化大革命进行罪恶和卑鄙的诬蔑和诋毁。社论强调说：它们企图向全世界掩盖毛泽东思想的巨大威力。但是它们办不到。它们见到毛泽东的名字就发抖。它们对毛泽东思想怕得要命。
    社论说：美帝国主义密切勾结苏联修正主义和以中国赫鲁晓夫为首的一小撮党内走资本主义道路的当权派，企图破坏无产阶级专政，在中国复辟资本主义。
    但是，毛泽东同志准确地发现并且指出了现代修正主义的新特点，苏联和修正主义把持的其他国家的资本主义复辟。他指出，在社会主义国家仍然存在阶级和阶级斗争，在中国仍然存在复辟资本主义、由无产阶级专政演变成资产阶级专政的可能性。
    为了预防资本主义在中国复辟，为了在中国横扫一切牛鬼蛇神，为了粉碎美帝国主义、修正主义和各国反动派的阴谋，为了巩固无产阶级专政和保证不间断地向社会主义发展，毛主席亲自发动和领导了中国无产阶级文化大革命。
    中国无产阶级文化革命是人类历史上最重大的革命事件。这个革命用毛泽东思想武装了中国七亿人民；这个革命是人类历史上规模最大的群众大发动；是在一个无产阶级专政的国家中由无产阶级自己发动的第一场大革命；是在埋葬帝国主义、修正主义和各国反动派的过程中起先锋作用的最大的物质和思想动力；是毛主席对马克思列宁主义的一个天才的新发展。
    中国无产阶级文化大革命的目的，是解决无产阶级和资产阶级这两个阶级之间的矛盾，以及社会主义和资本主义这两条道路之间的矛盾。
    社论指出：毛泽东思想保障了中国的无产阶级专政。
    毛泽东思想保障了中国的社会主义道路。
    毛泽东思想保证中国永远不会复辟资本主义。
    毛泽东思想保证中国永远鲜红。
    毛泽东思想保证了反对帝国主义、反对修正主义和反对各国反动派的胜利。
    毛泽东思想是全世界人民的伟大革命指南，保证了他们解放斗争的胜利发展。
    毛泽东思想是世界各国共产党（马列）成立、发展和巩固的最好保证。
    毛泽东思想是我们党的伟大指南。
    社论最后高呼：战无不胜的毛泽东思想伟大红旗万岁！
    我们的伟大导师、伟大领袖、伟大统帅、伟大舵手毛泽东同志万岁！
