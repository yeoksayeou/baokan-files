The reactionary film "Spark" is a black monument erected by China's Khrushchev and his agents in the literary and artistic circles to glorify themselves.

For a long time, China's Khrushchev, in order to achieve his evil goal of usurping the party and the country and restoring capitalism, has carried out a series of conspiratorial activities. The release of the reactionary film "Spark" is a blatant manifestation of this conspiracy.

	How the "Laurel Wreath" Was Placed on His Head

The reactionary film "Spark" goes to great lengths to distort history and confuse right and wrong, attributing the victory of the Anshan Mining Strike, which shocked the world, entirely to China's Khrushchev's "merits," and placing a "laurel wreath" of "labor leader" on the head of this great traitor and scoundrel.

History cannot be distorted. The revolutionary flames of Anshan were ignited by our great leader Chairman Mao, and the Anshan Strike was personally initiated and led by Mao. In the history of the revolutionary struggles of the Anshan workers, the brilliant light of Mao Zedong Thought shines. However, the old opportunist China's Khrushchev played the role of a traitor who compromised and surrendered in Anshan. He stubbornly stood on the reactionary position of the bourgeoisie, sabotaged the workers' movement, and worked tirelessly for the capitalists.

So, how did the "laurel wreath" of "labor leader" end up on the head of the great traitor China's Khrushchev?

It turns out that this "laurel wreath" was a bet made by China's Khrushchev to denigrate Chairman Mao, elevate himself, and gain political capital for the restoration of capitalism. He shamelessly placed it on his own head.

As early as 1923, China's Khrushchev wrote an article titled "A Brief History of the Anshan Mining Workers' Club." This poisonous weed completely omitted the great achievements of Chairman Mao in leading the workers' movement, but boasted of himself as a "worker representative" with "courage in every inch of his body." He claimed that during the negotiations, the capitalists and the brigade commander wanted to "chop him into mincemeat," but "this representative remained unmoved." In the end, he made the "brigade commander and the mine manager soften up and beg for mercy." This monstrous lie earned him a large amount of political capital and also set the tone for the film "Spark." In the film, during a negotiation scene, the incarnation of China's Khrushchev, Lei Huanjue, does not say to the capitalists, "Even if you chop me into mincemeat, you will not be able to make the workers return to work!" Look, even the original words from the "Brief History" were lifted.

In 1925, China's Khrushchev published "The Anshan Trade Union After the February 7th Failure," further advancing his conspiracy to distort history. In this article, he glorified the Anshan Trade Union under his "leadership," claiming that "in this period of extreme silence in the national workers' movement, only the Anshan Mining Trade Union was different, breaking through all obstacles and developing smoothly." He ignored the bloody oppression of imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism on the Chinese working class, ignored the miserable plight of the Anshan workers living in dire straits, and ignored the heroic struggles of the working class. Instead, he falsely claimed that Anshan had become a "paradise on earth" and "a small Moscow in China" under his "leadership." He even loudly proclaimed:

"Comrades, pay attention! Learn the tactics of the Anshan workers!" Once again, a monstrous lie added a few more circles to his political capital account.

The "laurel wreath" was thus gradually woven. In 1925, he wore this "laurel wreath" and climbed up a level, becoming the vice-chairman of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions. After that, China's Khrushchev boasted even more shamelessly about his "achievements" in Anshan, more brazenly forged history, and more viciously denigrated Chairman Mao, attempting to gain even more political capital.

In 1937, he told others that in Anshan, he had "absolute and unlimited faith" among "tens of thousands of workers." — How shamelessly he lied! The Anshan workers had unlimited faith in our great leader Chairman Mao, but they had unlimited contempt and hatred for the great traitor China's Khrushchev. He himself once admitted in a letter: "The workers want to beat me, saying I was bought by the capitalists."

In 1941, he told others: "Leaders come from the masses... In Anshan, [someone] was in the spotlight, but I was the one who worked hard behind the scenes." — How shamelessly he boasted of himself! The great leader is our most beloved Chairman Mao. You, China's Khrushchev, are just a great scoundrel who worked hard for the capitalists.

This political gambler became bolder. In 1957, when the trend of revisionism was rampant internationally and the domestic bourgeois rightists launched a ferocious attack on the party, he again published "A Brief History of the Anshan Mining Workers' Club," "Organizational Overview," and "Criticism of the Past and Plans for the Future of the Club," three poisonous weeds that forged history and erected monuments to himself. The Soviet revisionist clique also widely reprinted these three articles, praising him as the "creator of the workers' movement," and they echoed each other.

After such meticulous forgery and fabrication, China's Khrushchev wore the "laurel wreath" of "labor leader" and gained one advantage after another. However, this number one bourgeois careerist still wanted to further usurp the party and the country, needing to gain more political capital. The counter-revolutionary revisionists in the literary and artistic circles, such as Xia Yan, keenly understood their master's intentions and carefully produced the reactionary film "Spark," adding a "halo" to China's Khrushchev's "laurel wreath" of "labor leader."

	How the "Halo" Was Placed on His Head

The Lei Huanjue in the reactionary film "Spark" is the incarnation of China's Khrushchev. The creators of the film clearly stated in their creative plan that "Lei Huanjue was originally named Liu Shaoli" (a combination of China's Khrushchev and another opportunist XXXX). The creators of the film spared no effort in shaping the image of Lei Huanjue. The counter-revolutionary revisionist Xia Yan once gave such a black directive: "This person is related to the overall work, related to the ideological nature of the work. Anything that damages this character should not be included." He also said: "This person should stand out, with a halo behind him, like a painted image of Jesus."

What a "ideological nature"! What a "halo"! Xia Yan revealed the secret here. It turns out that their purpose in creating the film was to paint a "halo" for China's Khrushchev and to erect monuments for him.

How was the "halo" painted on China's Khrushchev's head?

Starting in 1958, China's Khrushchev repeatedly instructed literary and artistic workers to write "miner plays." He shouted everywhere to "write the history of miners' struggles to educate the youth." However, after watching a play depicting the Anshan Strike, he became furious and scolded: "The history at that time was not like this, you should check the history!" Why was China's Khrushchev so enraged? Because the play only treated him as a background character and did not glorify him as a "labor leader." Later, China's Khrushchev impatiently summoned bourgeois playwrights and suggested: "Why not write a miner play? The life of miners is very rich!"

The slaves Zhou Yang and Xia Yan understood the hidden meaning of their master's words. In a secret meeting, Zhou Yang told a certain capitalist-roadier in Jiangxi Province: "The north has already produced a revolutionary historical novel 'The Red Flag,' but the south has not moved. We are very uneasy." The certain capitalist-roadier in Jiangxi Province quickly told the film scriptwriter: "XXXX (China's Khrushchev) has a lot to write about in Anshan." The film scriptwriter received the imperial decree and, after reviewing the history forged by China's Khrushchev, wrote the screenplay for "Spark." Xia Yan, after reading the draft, excitedly said: "The foundation is very good." He said: "The character of Lei Huanjue is written very well, but lacks luster." He instructed the film scriptwriter to carefully paint a "halo" on China's Khrushchev's head.

To highlight the "halo" on China's Khrushchev's head and create public opinion for his usurpation of the party and the country, they viciously denigrated our great leader Chairman Mao. Their methods were so vicious and their arrogance so shameless that it made one's blood boil.

Xia Yan ordered: "It's good to remove the name of Mao Runzhi!"

The scriptwriter responded: "Only one leader character can be written."

The director followed: "It's not necessary to lift the deeds of Chairman Mao as they are."

What a chorus of gnashing teeth! They were filled with bone-deep hatred for the great teacher Chairman Mao and could not rest until they "removed" Chairman Mao's glorious name. In their minds, there was only one "leader," and that was the great traitor China's Khrushchev.

Thus, they wielded their axes and chopped out every mention of "Mao Runzhi," and even changed the places in the script where reports were made to Chairman Mao to reports made to the "Secretariat." The script originally had two dialogues where workers reminisced about Chairman Mao, and the author had described them lightly, but they were also chopped out by Xia Yan and his accomplices. Their counter-revolutionary intentions were so vicious!

To highlight the "halo" on China's Khrushchev's head, this group of conspirators gathered together, scratched their heads in despair, and worked tirelessly to beautify China's Khrushchev in the film, elevating him to the heavens.

They wrote: Lei Huanjue is "the most great and glorious typical representative of the times."

They strived to portray China's Khrushchev in the film as having "outstanding organizational and leadership abilities," being "loyal to the cause of the working class," and being "calm, composed, full of courage and wisdom" as the "image of the party leader."

Look at how unordinary Lei Huanjue's appearance is: the sun rises in the east, the whistle blows, and he sits steadily on top of a speeding train, with the large characters "1921" pushed out behind his head. It seems that he was born with our great party, truly like "Jesus descending to earth," coming to Anshan with a "thunderous" call to awaken the workers. It's as if there is no shame in the world!

China's Khrushchev and his pack of wolves used these despicable methods to forge history, using the art of film to enlarge the "laurel wreath" of "labor leader" on China's Khrushchev's head into a "halo," and to beautify China's Khrushchev. But they were not satisfied with this. They needed to launch an even more ferocious attack on the proletariat. As Lei Huanjue said in the film, "This is just the opening act!"

	The "Opening Act" of Restoring Capitalism Is Doomed

The reactionary film "Spark" was released in 1962. What an unusual year it was. In this year, the international imperialists, revisionists, and reactionaries launched a counter-revolutionary tide against China; domestic class enemies, in collaboration with the imperialists, revisionists, and reactionaries, launched a ferocious attack on our party; and the Chiang Kai-shek gang in Taiwan also clamored for a "counterattack on the mainland." For a time, both domestically and internationally, it was chaotic.

In this year, China's Khrushchev's black "Cultivation" was also reprinted and released.

In this counter-revolutionary grand performance, the reactionary film "Spark" sounded the first gong and drum to directly glorify China's Khrushchev in the form of literature and art. In the screenplay of "Spark," there was originally such a plot: the workers crowded around Lei Huanjue, insisting on carrying him in a sedan chair. Yi Mengzi also whispered in his ear: "This is not carrying you, but carrying our party!" (This sentence was too blatant and was later deleted) This sentence revealed the essence of this film. China's Khrushchev is the greatest representative of the bourgeoisie who has infiltrated our party, a great traitor to the international communist movement. Therefore, in the eyes of the bourgeoisie, China's Khrushchev is their ideal agent. The small group of counter-revolutionary revisionists such as Zhou Yang and Xia Yan, along with the ghosts and snakes, wanted to use the reactionary film "Spark" as a "sedan chair" to "carry" this bourgeois careerist who dreamed of usurping the party and the country to the "throne" he had long dreamed of, fully implementing the restoration of capitalism. This is just as our great leader Chairman Mao said: "The representatives of the bourgeoisie who have infiltrated the party, the government, the army, and various cultural circles are a group of counter-revolutionary revisionists. Once the time is ripe, they will seize power and turn the dictatorship of the proletariat into the dictatorship of the bourgeoisie."

However, the revolutionary torrent is unstoppable, and the wheels of history roll forward! In the blazing flames of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, this reactionary China's Khrushchev was dragged out by the proletarian revolutionaries and received the shameful fate he deserved. Let us raise the thousand-catty rod of Mao Zedong Thought, smash the "laurel wreath" on China's Khrushchev's head, extinguish the "halo" on China's Khrushchev's head, and send China's Khrushchev and the black monument "Spark" erected for him together into the garbage heap of history!

    砸碎伪造的“桂冠”　扑灭虚假的“光圈”
    ——揭穿中国赫鲁晓夫及其同伙炮制反动影片《燎原》的罪恶企图
    计红绪　侯作卿
    反动影片《燎原》，是中国赫鲁晓夫伙同他在文艺界的代理人为自己树立的一座黑碑。
    长期以来，中国赫鲁晓夫为了实现其篡党、篡国，复辟资本主义的罪恶目的，进行了一系列的阴谋活动。反动影片《燎原》的出笼，就是这一阴谋活动露骨的表现。
          “桂冠”是怎样戴在头上的
    反动影片《燎原》竭尽篡改历史、颠倒黑白之能事，把震惊中外的安源路矿大罢工的胜利，一古脑儿全记在中国赫鲁晓夫的“功劳簿”上，硬在这个大工贼、大叛徒的头上戴上了一顶“工运领袖”的“桂冠”。
    历史不容篡改。安源的革命烈火是我们伟大领袖毛主席亲手点燃的，安源大罢工是毛主席亲自发动和领导的。在安源工人的革命斗争史上，闪烁着毛泽东思想的灿烂光辉。而老机会主义者中国赫鲁晓夫，却在安源扮演了一个妥协投降的叛徒角色。他顽固地站在资产阶级的反动立场上，破坏工人运动，为资本家效尽犬马之劳。
    那么，“工运领袖”的“桂冠”又是怎样戴到大叛徒中国赫鲁晓夫头上去的呢？
    原来，这顶“桂冠”是中国赫鲁晓夫为了贬低毛主席、抬高自己，为了捞取复辟资本主义的政治资本而下的赌注，是他自己不知羞耻地硬往头上戴的。
    早在一九二三年，中国赫鲁晓夫就写了一篇《安源路矿工人俱乐部略史》。这篇毒草完全“略”去了毛主席领导工人运动的伟大功绩，却把自己吹嘘为“一身是胆”的“工人代表”。说什么在谈判中，资本家和军阀旅长要把他“砍成肉泥”，“不料这位代表毫不为动”，最后竟使“旅长与矿长都软了下来，唯唯要求而已。”这一弥天大谎使他捞了一大笔政治资本，同时，也为影片《燎原》定下了基调。影片中谈判一场，中国赫鲁晓夫的化身雷焕觉不是对资本家说吗：“你们就是把我砍成肉泥，也休想工人复工！”你看，连《略史》中的原话都搬上去了。
    一九二五年，中国赫鲁晓夫抛出《二七失败后的安源工会》一文，使他这项篡改历史的阴谋活动又升了一级。在这篇文章中，他大肆美化他“领导”之下的安源工会，说什么“在这种全国工人运动极沉寂的时期里面，独有一个安源路矿工会偏偏不是这样，偏偏还能打破一切障碍发展自如。”他无视帝国主义、封建主义和官僚资本主义对中国工人阶级的血腥压榨，无视安源工人的生活处于水深火热的悲惨境地，他无视工人阶级的英勇斗争，却胡说安源在他“领导”下已变成了“世外桃源”和“中国的小莫斯科”。他甚至大声疾呼：
  “工友们注意！注意学习安源工友的战术。”又一次弥天大谎，使他政治资本的存折上增添了几个圈圈。
    “桂冠”就这样逐渐编织成了。一九二五年，他戴着这顶“桂冠”向上爬了一级，当上了全国总工会的副委员长。继此之后，中国赫鲁晓夫更加变本加厉地吹嘘他在安源的“功绩”，更加肆无忌惮地伪造历史，更加恶毒地贬低毛主席，妄图捞取更大的政治资本。
    一九三七年，他对别人说，他在安源“×万工人中有绝对无限的信仰”。——这是多么厚颜无耻的撒谎！安源工人无限信仰的是我们伟大领袖毛主席，而对大叛徒中国赫鲁晓夫却是无限蔑视和痛恨。他自己曾在一封信里供认道：“工人要打我，说我被资本家收买”。
    一九四一年，他又对人说：“领袖来自群众……在安源时，抛头露面的是×××，埋头苦干的可就是我。”——这又是多么厚颜无耻的自我吹嘘！伟大领袖是我们最最敬爱的毛主席，你中国赫鲁晓夫不过是为资本家“埋头苦干”的一个大工贼而已。
    这个政治赌棍的胆子越来越大。在一九五七年国际上修正主义思潮大泛滥，国内资产阶级右派向党发起猖狂进攻的时候，他又重新抛出《安源路矿工人俱乐部略史》、《组织概况》和《对俱乐部过去的批评和将来的计划》这三篇伪造历史、为自己树碑立传的毒草。苏修集团也大肆转载他这三篇文章，吹捧他为“工人运动缔造者”，彼此呼应起来。
    经过如此这般的一番精心篡改、编造，中国赫鲁晓夫便戴着“工运领袖”这顶“桂冠”，占了一个又一个“大便宜”。然而这个头号资产阶级野心家还要进一步篡党、篡国，需要捞取更多的政治资本。文艺界的反革命修正主义分子夏衍之流深察主子的意旨，便精心炮制出了反动影片《燎原》，在中国赫鲁晓夫
  “工运领袖”的“桂冠”上加了一道“光圈”。
          “光圈”是怎样加在头上的
    反动影片《燎原》里的雷焕觉，是中国赫鲁晓夫的化身。炮制者创作计划里明文写着“雷焕觉原来叫柳少立”（即中国赫鲁晓夫与另一个机会主义者×××的混合体）。影片炮制者竭尽全力塑造雷焕觉这个形象。反革命修正主义分子夏衍曾有过这样的黑指示：雷焕觉“这个人关系到全面，关系到作品的思想性，任何有损这个人物的东西都不要。”又说：“这个人站出来，要有光彩，和画的耶稣像一样，后面有一个光圈。”
    好一个“思想性”！好一个“光圈”！夏衍在这里泄露了天机。原来他们炮制影片的目的就是为了给中国赫鲁晓夫编绘一道“光圈”，就是为了给中国赫鲁晓夫树碑立传。
    中国赫鲁晓夫头上的“光圈”是怎样编绘的呢？
    从一九五八年起，中国赫鲁晓夫就一再别有用心地指示文艺工作者写“矿工戏”。他到处叫嚷“写矿工斗争史以教育青年”。可是当他看了一出描写安源大罢工的矿工戏之后，又大为恼火地叱责：当时的历史不是这个样子的，你们去查查历史！中国赫鲁晓夫为什么这样暴跳如雷呢？因为这个戏只把他做暗场处理，并没有把他当“工运领袖”大力吹捧。后来，中国赫鲁晓夫又急不可耐地把资产阶级剧作家找来提示：“怎么不写一出矿工戏呵？矿工生活很丰富哩！”
    周扬、夏衍这般奴才对主子这番话的潜台词是心领神会的。在一次黑会上，周扬对江西省的某走资派说：“北方已经搞出一个革命历史小说《红旗谱》，南方还没有动静，我们很不安。”江西省的某走资派连忙对影片编剧说：“×××（中国赫鲁晓夫）在安源有许多可以写。”影片编剧接到圣旨，便查阅被中国赫鲁晓夫伪造的历史，写出了《燎原》的电影剧本。夏衍看了初稿，兴奋地说：“基础很好。”他说：“雷焕觉这个人物写得很好，但缺乏光彩。”并指示影片编剧要在中国赫鲁晓夫头上精心编绘一道“光圈”。
    为了突出中国赫鲁晓夫头上的“光圈”，为其篡党、篡国制造舆论，他们大肆贬低我们伟大领袖毛主席，手段之毒辣，气焰之嚣张，令人怒火中烧。
    夏衍下令：“毛润芝的名字去掉了好！”
    编剧应声：“写领袖人物只能写一个。”
    导演跟上：“不一定把毛主席的事迹原本搬上。”
    这真是一片咬牙切齿声！他们对伟大导师毛主席充满刻骨仇恨，非要“去掉”毛主席的光辉名字而后快。他们心目中只有一个“领袖”，这就是大叛徒中国赫鲁晓夫。
    于是，他们操起板斧，凡有“毛润芝”的字样统统砍掉了，就连剧本中提到向毛主席汇报的地方，也改成向“书记部”汇报。剧本中原有两段工人怀念毛主席的对话，作者本来就是轻描淡写，但也被夏衍之流砍掉了。他们的反革命用心何其毒也！
    为了突出中国赫鲁晓夫头上的“光圈”，这伙阴谋家聚在一起，搔首苦思，惨淡经营，拚命在影片中美化中国赫鲁晓夫，把他捧上了九霄天。
    他们写道：雷焕觉是“代表时代前进方向最伟大最光荣的典型”。
    他们竭力在影片中把中国赫鲁晓夫描绘成“有杰出的组织领导才能”，“对工人阶级事业忠心耿耿”，“镇静、沉着，充满着勇敢和智慧”的“党的领导者的形象”。
    你看这个雷焕觉出场多么不“平凡”：旭日东升，汽笛长鸣，他稳坐在奔驰的列车顶上，脑袋后面推出特写大字“一九二一年”。仿佛他与我们伟大的党一同诞生，真象“耶稣下凡”一样来到安源，“雷”一般地“唤”起工人的“觉”醒。真不知人间还有羞耻事！
    中国赫鲁晓夫及其狐群狗党就是使用这些卑劣手段伪造了历史，用电影艺术的形式把中国赫鲁晓夫头上“工运领袖”的“桂冠”放大为“光圈”，极力美化中国赫鲁晓夫。但是他们决不满足于此。他们还需要更疯狂地向无产阶级进攻。反动影片《燎原》的出笼，用雷焕觉的话来说，“这只不过是一场开锣戏！”
      复辟资本主义的“开锣戏”完蛋了
    反动影片《燎原》出笼于一九六二年。这是多么不平常的一年啊。就在这一年，国际上帝、修、反掀起了一股反华逆流；国内阶级敌人配合帝、修、反向我们党发动猖狂进攻；盘踞在台湾的蒋介石匪帮也叫嚣“反攻大陆”。一时国内国外，闹得乌烟瘴气。
    就在这一年，中国赫鲁晓夫的黑《修养》也再版出笼了。
    在这场反革命的大表演里，反动影片《燎原》敲响了以文艺形式直接吹捧中国赫鲁晓夫的第一场锣鼓。《燎原》电影剧本中原有这样一个情节：工人们簇拥着雷焕觉，一定要用轿子把他抬起来。易猛子还在他耳边低声说：“这不是抬你，是抬我们党呵！”（这句话实在太露骨，后来被删去了）这句话一语道出了这部影片的真谛。中国赫鲁晓夫是钻进我们党内的最大的资产阶级代表人物，是国际共产主义运动的大叛徒。因此，在资产阶级的眼里，中国赫鲁晓夫是他们最理想的代理人。周扬、夏衍等一小撮反革命修正主义分子和牛鬼蛇神，就是要用反动影片《燎原》这样的“轿子”把这个妄图篡党、篡国的资产阶级野心家“抬”起来，捧上他久已梦想的“宝座”，全面实行资本主义复辟。这正如我们伟大领袖毛主席所说：“混进党里、政府里、军队里和各种文化界的资产阶级代表人物，是一批反革命的修正主义分子，一旦时机成熟，他们就会要夺取政权，由无产阶级专政变为资产阶级专政。”
    但是，革命的洪流不可阻挡，历史的车轮滚滚向前！在无产阶级文化大革命的熊熊烈火中，这个倒行逆施的中国赫鲁晓夫被无产阶级革命派揪了出来，得到了应得的可耻下场。让我们奋起毛泽东思想的千钧棒，砸碎中国赫鲁晓夫头上的“桂冠”，扑灭中国赫鲁晓夫头上的“光圈”，把中国赫鲁晓夫和为他树起的
  《燎原》黑碑一起送进历史的垃圾堆！
