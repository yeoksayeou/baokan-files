Here, I discuss my experiences in studying and applying Chairman Mao Zedong's thoughts and fighting against officialdom.

Leaders must "criticize and repent" by starting with the "official" mindset

Previously, I had a misconception, always thinking that leaders having a bit of officialdom was a minor issue. After all, being a team leader and being a soldier can't be the same, right? Under this mindset, whenever I interacted with cadres and soldiers, I always appeared as a leader, assuming the role of an educator, subjectively setting the tone and drawing boundaries. Sometimes, when comrades criticized me for putting on airs, I might not have said anything on the surface, but internally, I was quite unhappy, especially when the criticism was sharp. I felt that the masses were overly concerned with these "minor issues."

The torrent of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution shook my soul. Especially when I saw that a handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party had been exposed, and some had made serious mistakes. Among these people, some were indeed infiltrators from the enemy class and representatives of the bourgeoisie. However, many had previously participated in the revolution and crossed the democratic revolution's threshold. Why, under the dictatorship of the proletariat, did they fall when continuing the revolution? I pondered this question while studying Chairman Mao's works. Chairman Mao warned us as early as the eve of national victory: "Because of victory, arrogance, the sense of being a hero, the sense of stagnation and not seeking progress, the desire for enjoyment and not wanting to live a hard life, may grow." Seriously understanding Chairman Mao's teachings, I realized: a significant reason they fell was that they had become big officials, earned high salaries, and thought highly of themselves, thus putting on airs, acting like lords, and severely alienating themselves from the masses. Without the masses' supervision, they allowed bourgeois and revisionist thoughts to corrupt their souls, ultimately sliding down the slippery slope of their own officialdom. Following Chairman Mao's teachings, reflecting on comrades' criticisms, and examining myself, I realized: I too was unconsciously building this dangerous slippery slope. I seriously examined my problems, identifying the great harm of the "official" mindset. I deeply felt: with the "official" mindset, one cannot look downwards, humbly learn from the masses, and be a student of the masses; with the "official" mindset, one cannot tolerate criticism, but enjoys flattery and fears criticism; with the "official" mindset, one will be high and mighty, pampered, afraid of hardship, and shun difficulties; with the "official" mindset, one will show off, use power to suppress others, act emotionally, and disregard policies. In short, with the "official" mindset, one will inevitably not follow Chairman Mao, inevitably be at odds with Mao Zedong Thought, inevitably alienate oneself from the masses, and the relationship will not be like fish in water but like water and oil, ultimately becoming an opponent of the masses and a stumbling block to the revolution. It is this "official" mindset that caused me to deviate from Chairman Mao's teachings and alienate myself from the masses.

Chairman Mao's teachings and the enlightenment of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution made me see the harm of the "official" mindset. The high ideals and deep class feelings of cadres and soldiers in the army also most vividly and practically educated me, further raising my awareness of fighting against officialdom.

One day, I suddenly received a report that Platoon Leader Yu Yuanjiao had died in a landslide at a construction site. With a heavy heart, I rushed to the scene and learned that when nine detonation points were about to explode, landslides were continuous, and the situation was extremely dangerous, five soldiers, including Lun Wenji, bravely risked their lives to pull Yu Yuanjiao out from under the rubble. The soldiers' bravery deeply moved me. I praised them, saying, "You fearlessly faced danger, stepped forward, and rescued your class brothers. You are Chairman Mao's good soldiers." However, they burst into tears. Soldier Peng Zhaotao cried and said to me, "Team Leader, don't praise us. The more you praise us, the more painful we feel. If we had been loyal to Chairman Mao's teachings and had deep class feelings, we should have done everything possible to prevent the team leader from going to the most dangerous place; if we had been loyal to Chairman Mao's teachings and had deep class feelings, we should not have let the team leader leave the work site last; if we had been loyal to Chairman Mao's teachings and had deep class feelings, we should have used our lives to replace the team leader. But in the end, the team leader rushed to light the last fuse, and when leaving the danger zone, he let us go first, keeping the danger for himself and safety for us. The true good soldiers of Chairman Mao are not us, but our team leader." The soldiers' highest, most sincere, and deepest class feelings made me shed tears. After bidding farewell to Yu Yuanjiao's body with tears, these five soldiers said to me even more sadly, "The team leader is Chairman Mao's good soldier, a good servant of the people, and our dear class brother. The heavier the task, the tighter the time, the more he cared about our study of Chairman Mao's works; the more difficulties and dangers there were, the more he cared about our safety; the harder the work and the worse the weather, the more he cared about our lives. He trusted the masses in everything, treated everyone equally, strictly demanded of himself, and had not a hint of officialdom. Such a good team leader and close friend, we cannot do without him."

The soldiers' deep class feelings in remembering their team leader, and their praise for the team leader, all touched my soul. Comparing myself with Yu Yuanjiao and Chairman Mao's teachings, I felt even more that my worldview needed a thorough transformation. I repeatedly reflected on comrades' criticisms of me, realizing: I have a "selfish" mindset and officialdom in my actions; I do not hate the "selfish" mindset and tolerate officialdom, which cannot be considered minor issues. People like me, when I speak, people listen; when I command, people move; in life, people take care of me. If I do not criticize and repent my selfishness, the "selfish" mindset will only grow; if I do not eliminate officialdom, officialdom will only worsen. Therefore, I realized: as a mid-level leader, I must always criticize and repent my selfishness and fight against officialdom.

Only by going to the masses can one completely eliminate officialdom

Previously, I had a wrong self-assessment, thinking I had experience and ability, carrying the burden of being "always right." Although I also acknowledged that the masses are the creators of history and that there are many wise people among the masses, and that I should learn from the masses and be a student of the masses, in practice, I found the masses too talkative and noisy, not as deep-thinking or quick as myself. When facing issues, I had the mindset of commanding and educating the masses, not believing in, relying on, or learning from the masses. This was the most prominent manifestation of officialdom and the main obstacle to eliminating it.

Chairman Mao's great practice of believing in the masses, relying on the masses, and being heart-to-heart with the masses set a brilliant example for us. Chairman Mao humbly said, "Together with all Party comrades, I will continue to learn from the masses and be a student forever. This is my wish." This made me realize that the attitude towards the masses is not a general method issue but a fundamental stance, a fundamental attitude issue, a worldview issue, and an issue of attitude towards Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, as well as the core issue of whether one can eliminate officialdom. I decided to go among the masses, put down my official airs, be a humble student, and together with the masses, annihilate officialdom.

The company is the best battlefield for annihilating officialdom. Only by going deep down, learning from company cadres and soldiers, can one eliminate officialdom and thoroughly transform one's worldview. Last year, I went to a company and sought advice from cadres and soldiers. Upon arriving at the company, I happened to encounter the "Four Good" monthly inspection, where comrades were giving feedback to the leadership. The soldiers spoke passionately, emotionally, and sharply. However, the political instructor sat calmly, listened attentively, and encouraged everyone, saying, "Well said, well said." At that moment, I thought: if I were in such a situation, hearing so many criticisms, I would either jump up or blush. From the political instructor, I learned his loyalty to Chairman Mao, using Mao Zedong Thought to transform his soul, strong Party consciousness, good democratic style, courage to take responsibility, and skill in uniting comrades. I took him as an example, compared and checked my problems. I recalled an incident: last May, the army was in the midst of a revolutionary criticism high tide, and I also knew the importance of two-line struggle education. However, I was also concerned about the construction task not being completed, so I proposed the slogan "Fight Red May." At that time, comrades in the company reflected that this slogan was not good and had an impact on the ongoing revolutionary criticism; cadres in the headquarters also pointed out that the political banner was not clear. I heard these reflections and felt a bit angry. I thought: you haven't fully implemented it yet and are already giving feedback. Do you think you are wiser than the leadership? Regarding this incident, I studied Chairman Mao's teachings on the five conditions for successors of the proletarian revolutionary cause and "The Working Method of the Party Committee." Chairman Mao's teachings made me realize: it was my serious officialdom. In the Party Committee's heart-to-heart meeting, I brought out all these problems, thoroughly dug out the root causes, and made a self-criticism. Through this study, the masses' viewpoint deeply rooted in my mind. My view of the masses changed, and the masses' view of me also changed.

The masses have strong revolutionary spirit and high consciousness. Only by sincerely learning from the masses can one wholeheartedly serve as a good servant of the people. To completely eliminate officialdom and truly be a student of the masses, I often learn from soldiers. Cook Liu Shengli is my learning example. In half a month, he received two urgent letters from his wife, saying that someone in the family had died and urging him to return home immediately. However, due to the work at that time being indispensable, he silently studied Chairman Mao's works and continued to work diligently. Liu Shengli's excellent quality of prioritizing the collective over personal interests in the face of conflicting personal and revolutionary interests deeply moved me. I used his spirit of wholeheartedly serving the people to fight against officialdom.

Our soldiers are the wisest and most talented. Once, I went to the Fifth Company to inspect the quality of the project. I happened to encounter several soldiers performing block stone masonry, and just as they were about to reach the arch top, it suddenly collapsed. They were investigating the problem, researching the cause, and asked me for advice and instructions. I spoke twice, but neither time hit the mark. In the end, it was Squad Leader Fang Daolong who solved the problem. In the process of working with them, I saw with my own eyes that the soldiers had a clear understanding of the project, were responsible, and pursued excellence, and the project progressed quickly and well. In comparison, I felt that my experience was not as rich as the soldiers', my knowledge was not as extensive as the soldiers', and my sense of responsibility was not as strong as the soldiers'. This made me further understand: Chairman Mao's recent proposition that "in a certain sense, the wisest and most talented are the soldiers with the most practical experience" is an unbreakable truth. In the process of learning from soldiers, I not only seriously learned their lofty thoughts and excellent revolutionary qualities but also actively opened my mind, exposed my selfishness, fought against officialdom, sincerely and humbly accepted their criticisms, and treated every piece of advice from comrades as a bullet to annihilate officialdom and every criticism as a battle to annihilate officialdom. Over the past year, I have used "Three Articles" as a weapon and soldiers as examples, making progress in fighting against selfishness and officialdom.

The broad cadres and soldiers have high ideological awareness, strong revolutionary spirit, and rich practical experience. Their deep class feelings for Chairman Mao increased my loyalty and love for Chairman Mao; their high standards of studying and applying "Three Articles" to transform their worldview strengthened my determination for self-transformation; their rich experience increased my confidence in doing a good job. I further realized: only by going to the masses can one clearly see the harm of officialdom, deepen the hatred for officialdom, and completely eliminate officialdom.

Grasp a fleeting thought and thoroughly uproot the old roots of officialdom

Through struggle, my officialdom has greatly decreased, but in some "small matters" and "small problems," it still often manifests. Officialdom and personal authority thoughts still flash in my mind. Especially when I hear some comrades praising me for daring to fight against officialdom and continuously fighting against officialdom, I feel satisfied. I think that those "small problems" that are "not related to the big picture" and "small matters" that are "acceptable" do not need to be overemphasized. I brought this question to the study of Chairman Mao's teachings on "the transformation of worldview is a fundamental transformation" and related instructions from Vice Chairman Lin, realizing: fighting officialdom with officialdom is not effective in eliminating officialdom. One must use "Three Articles" as a weapon, ignite a revolution in the depths of the soul, grasp the fleeting thoughts of officialdom, and launch a fierce offensive.

First, grasp the fleeting thought of "not related to the big picture" and fiercely criticize and fight. Once, the logistics department wanted to deal with a batch of old cows that could not be used. My opinion was to sell these old cows and buy a few more draft cows to use. The matter was decided this way. When I returned from a trip, I saw that these cows had not been dealt with. The logistics department comrades said: the political commissar did not agree with this handling. He thought it was better to handle it internally. I heard this and my mind heated up, thinking: as a team leader, I can't even decide on a few cows, will others listen to me in the future? I always felt a bit uncomfortable. In the study, I always thought this was a small matter unrelated to the big picture, not harming the overall situation, and did not mention it. After studying Chairman Mao's instructions on leadership methods, I realized that the political commissar's approach of grasping policies and considering internal and external influences was completely correct, while my dissatisfaction was the "selfish" mindset and personal authority thoughts acting up. This fleeting thought of "not related to the big picture," although the matter is small and the time is short, exposed the "selfish" and "official" "enemy." Is it to fight or not to fight? Is it to fight openly or secretly? Is it to annihilate or just defeat? This is the most practical test of a communist's class consciousness. Therefore, in a Party Committee's self-criticism meeting, I actively and boldly brought out this fleeting thought of "selfishness," placed it on the table, put it among the masses, and fiercely criticized and fought against it.

Second, grasp the fleeting thought of "acceptable" and fiercely criticize and fight. Once at night, I passed by the command post building, and a staff officer was leaning out of the window, casually calling me, "Team Leader! There's a new situation, come up quickly, I'll tell you." Hearing this, I was very displeased and went upstairs to scold him severely. I thought: I am the team leader, and you are the staff officer. If there's something, you should come downstairs to report to me, not casually call me upstairs. You have a problem, and my criticism of you is justified and "acceptable." Later, through studying Chairman Mao's related instructions and teachings, I realized that my "acceptable" thoughts were wrong, and the way I scolded him was even more wrong. From the situation at that time, the duty logbook was upstairs, going upstairs to look at the duty logbook would make the situation clearer; there were more people upstairs, discussing with everyone would make the situation handled more correctly; the situation was urgent, handling it upstairs would save time; only by discussing it upstairs would military secrets not be leaked. Therefore, the staff officer calling me upstairs was reasonable. But why did I still think that criticizing him was "acceptable"? This was entirely due to officialdom, ultimately because the "selfish" mindset was at work.

I further thought: this staff officer casually greeting me showed that he did not consider me an outsider, reflecting a close relationship between superiors and subordinates; while I was afraid that subordinates would treat me as an equal, wasn't this isolating myself from the masses? Going upstairs and downstairs, although it's just one character difference, it reflects whether one is a servant of the people or an official lord, whether one is for the public or for oneself. Although the matter is small, it reflects a big problem. Therefore, I grasped this fleeting thought of "acceptable," made a self-criticism at the cadre meeting, and apologized to this staff officer in person.

Third, grasp the fleeting thought in the process of fighting "selfishness" and fiercely criticize and fight. In the past one or two years, lectures and sharing sessions have been very common, and I have participated in quite a few. However, exposing and fighting "selfishness" was not thorough. On the surface, exposing and fighting "selfishness" was also very bold and frank, but in the heart, it was often circling around the boundaries of exposing "selfishness" and the degree of fighting "selfishness." It was easy to consider how others would react, whether they were satisfied, whether it would pass or not? Through studying Chairman Mao's theory on continuing the revolution under the dictatorship of the proletariat, and Vice Chairman Lin's related instructions on breaking "selfishness" and establishing "publicness," as well as the heroic examples of Cai Yongxiang, Lü Xiangbi, and Nian Sihuang, I repeatedly thought: they joined the revolution not as long as I did, but their contributions to the Party are greater than mine; they were educated by the Party not as long as I was, but their ideological realm is higher than mine. Why did these young comrades become the heroes of this era? The most fundamental reason is that they are infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao, infinitely loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, and infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line; they can completely and thoroughly fight against "selfishness" and revisionism, completely and thoroughly be servants of the people. While I am still lacking in "loyalty" and "publicness." In the process of fighting against "selfishness," I still lack revolutionary thoroughness. To completely eliminate the "selfish" mindset in my mind, I must learn from these heroic figures, dare to launch an offensive in fighting against "selfishness," and be a thorough revolutionary.

Long-term positive and negative experiences have made me realize: the most powerful ideological weapon for fighting against officialdom is "Three Articles," and the best place is among the masses. Only by thoroughly studying and applying "Three Articles" and going to the masses to accept tempering and testing can one completely eliminate officialdom, eradicate selfishness, and always maintain the demeanor of an ordinary soldier.

    彻底打掉官气　永作普通一兵
    广州部队某部团长　芦苇
      这里谈的是我活学活用毛泽东思想、同官气作斗争的一些体会。
    领导干部要“斗私”就要从“官”字上开刀
    以前，我有个错觉，总认为：领导干部有点官气是个小节问题。当团长和当战士总不能一样嘛！在这个思想指导下，我和干部、战士接触时，总是以领导的身份出现，以教育者自居，主观地定调子，划框框。有时，同志们批评我摆官架子，我表面上虽然没说什么，但内心很不高兴，尤其是当群众的批评尖锐一些的时候，反认为群众对这些“小节”问题过分计较。
    无产阶级文化大革命的激流，触动了我的灵魂。特别是看到党内一小撮走资派被揪出来了，还有一部分人犯了严重的错误。在这些人中间，固然有的是钻进来的阶级异己分子和资产阶级代表人物，但有相当多的人，他们过去革过命，闯过了民主革命的关。为什么在无产阶级专政下继续进行革命的时候，却倒下去了呢？我带着这个问题学习毛主席著作。毛主席早在全国胜利的前夕，就告诫我们：“因为胜利，党内的骄傲情绪，以功臣自居的情绪，停顿起来不求进步的情绪，贪图享乐不愿再过艰苦生活的情绪，可能生长。”认真领会毛主席这一教导，我认识到：他们倒下去的一个很重要的原因，是因为官做大了，薪水多了，自以为了不起，就摆架子，做官当老爷，严重脱离群众，在没有群众监督的情况下，让资产阶级思想、修正主义思想腐蚀了自己的灵魂，结果就从自己树起来的官架子这个滑梯上溜下去了。遵照毛主席的教导，想想同志们的批评，看一看自己，我觉察到：自己也在自觉不自觉地树起了这样一个危险的滑梯。我认真检查了自己的问题，找出了“官”字的极大危害。我深深感到：有了“官”字，就不能眼睛向下，虚心向群众学习，甘当群众的小学生；有了“官”字，就听不得逆耳之言，而喜欢奉承，害怕批评；有了“官”字，就会高高在上，养尊处优，畏艰苦，怕困难；有了“官”字，就会耍威风，以势压人，感情用事，不讲政策。一句话，有了“官”字，就必然不能紧跟毛主席，就必然和毛主席的思想格格不入，就必然脱离群众，和群众的关系不是象鱼和水那样分不开，而是象水和油那样合不来，最后必然成为群众的对立面，革命的绊脚石。正是这个“官”字，使我离开了毛主席的教导，脱离了群众。
    毛主席的教导，无产阶级文化大革命的启示，使我看到了“官”字的危害。部队中干部、战士崇高的思想和深厚的阶级感情，也最生动、最实际地教育了我，使我进一步提高了狠斗“官”气的自觉性。
    一天，我突然接到报告，连长喻远约同志因工地塌方牺牲了。我怀着十分沉痛的心情赶到现场，了解到：在九个炸点就要爆炸，塌方连续不断，万分危急的情况下，伦文基等五个战士硬是冒着生命危险，用双手把喻远约同志从土石底下扒出来。这五位战士冒着生命危险抢救连长的事迹，深深感动了我。我表扬他们说：“你们临危不惧，挺身而出，抢救自己的阶级兄弟，你们是毛主席的好战士。”可是他们却放声痛哭起来。战士彭灼桃边哭边对我说：“团长，你别表扬了，你一表扬，我们就更难过了。如果我们忠于毛主席的教导，有深厚的阶级感情，就应该千方百计地不让连长到险情最大的地方去；如果我们忠于毛主席的教导，有深厚的阶级感情，就不该让连长最后离开作业面；如果我们忠于毛主席的教导，有深厚的阶级感情，就应该用自己的生命把连长顶换下来。但是，最后一根导火索连长抢着去点，离开危险区时，他叫我们走在前面，他把危险留给自己，把安全让给了我们。真正的毛主席的好战士不是我们，而是我们的连长。”战士们这种最高尚、最真挚、最深厚的阶级感情，使我禁不住流下了眼泪。当我含着眼泪同喻远约同志的遗体告别以后，这五位战士更加悲痛地向我说：“连长是毛主席的好战士，是人民的好勤务员，是我们亲如手足的好阶级兄弟。任务越重，时间越紧，他越是关心我们学习毛主席著作；困难越多，险情越大，他越是关心我们的安危；劳动越累，气候越坏，他越是关心我们的生活。他事事相信群众，处处平等待人，时时严格要求自己，没有一点官气。这样的好连长、贴心人，我们离不开他。”
    战士们怀念连长的深厚阶级感情，称赞连长的每句话，都触动我的灵魂。对照毛主席的教导，对比喻远约同志，想一想自己，越觉得自己的世界观需要彻底改造。我反复回想了同志们对我的批评，认识到：自己头脑里有“私”字，行动上有官气；对“私”字不恨，对官气姑息，不能说是小节问题。象我这样的人，说话有人听，指挥有人动，生活上有人照顾，不斗私心，“私”字必然越来越大；不打掉官气，官气必然越来越严重。因此，我觉悟到：作为一个中层领导干部，必须时时刻刻狠斗私心，狠打官气。
    只有到群众中去，才能彻底打掉“官”气
    过去，我对自己有一个错误的估计，认为自己有经验，有水平，背上了“老正确”的思想包袱。虽然口头上我也承认群众是历史的创造者，也喊人多智广，要向群众学习，做群众的小学生，但实际上做起来，却嫌人多嘴杂，不如自己想的深，来的快。遇事有指挥群众、教育群众之心，无相信群众、依靠群众、向群众学习之意。这就是官气最突出的表现，也是影响自己打掉官气的主要障碍。
    毛主席相信群众，依靠群众，和群众心连心的伟大实践，给我们树立了光辉的典范。毛主席非常谦逊地说：“和全党同志共同一起向群众学习，继续当一个小学生，这就是我的志愿。”这使我认识到，对待群众的态度，不是一般的方法问题，而是一个根本立场、根本态度问题，是一个世界观问题，是对待毛主席革命路线的态度问题，也是能否打掉官气的核心问题。我决心到群众里面去，放下官架子，甘当小学生，和群众一起围歼“官”气。
    连队是围歼“官”气的最好战场。只有深入下去，向连队干部、战士学习，才能打掉官气，彻底改造世界观。去年，我到一个连队去，向干部战士请教。一到连队，正好赶上“四好”月检查，给领导提意见。战士们发言很热烈，情绪很激动，语句很刺耳。但是指导员却坐得住，听得进，还鼓励大家说：“提得好，提得好。”当时我想：要是我在这样的场合，听了这样多的批评，就是不跳起来，也会面红耳赤。从指导员身上，我学到了他忠于毛主席，用毛泽东思想改造自己的灵魂，党的观念强，民主作风好，勇于承担责任，善于团结同志的崇高品质和优良作风。我就以这位指导员为榜样，对比检查了自己的问题。我想起了一件事：去年五月份，部队正掀起革命大批判的高潮，我也知道两条路线斗争教育的重要性，但又担心施工任务上不去，所以提出“大战红五月”的口号。当时，连队的同志反映，这种提法不好，对正在开展的革命大批判有影响；机关干部也提出，这个口号突出政治的旗帜不鲜明。我一听到这些反映，就有些冒火。心想：你还没有很好贯彻就提意见，难道你比领导还高明？针对这件事，我又学习了毛主席关于无产阶级革命事业接班人的五个条件和《党委会的工作方法》，毛主席的教导使我认识到：是自己存在着严重的官气。在党委交心会上，我把这些问题统统亮了出来，狠挖了思想根源，作了自我批评。通过这次学习，群众观点在我的脑子里根扎深了。我对群众的看法改变了，群众对我的看法也改变了。
    群众的革命精神强，觉悟高。只有真心诚意地向群众学习，才能全心全意地当好人民的勤务员。为了彻底打掉“官”气，真正做群众的小学生，我就经常向战士学习请教。炊事员毛胜利同志就是我的学习榜样。半个月内他收到爱人两封急信，说是家里死了人，催他火速回家料理。但是，由于当时工作离不开，他不声不响地学习毛主席著作，照旧兢兢业业地干工作。毛胜利同志在个人利益和革命利益发生矛盾的情况下，“公”字当头，把家庭问题置之度外，这种优秀品质，使我很受感动。我就用他这种全心全意为人民服务的精神来狠斗“官”气。
    我们的战士最有智慧，最有才干。一次我到五连去检查工程质量，正碰上几个战士在进行块石砌筑作业，快要砌到拱顶时，突然塌了下来。他们在查找问题，研究原因，要我出点子作指示。我发了两次言，都没有说到点子上，最后还是班长方道龙把问题解决了。在和他们一起劳动的过程中，我亲眼看到，战士们对工程胸有成竹，认真负责，精益求精，工程进展得又快又好。相比之下，我感到自己的经验没有战士们多，知识没有战士们丰富，责任心没有战士们强。这使我进一步体会到：毛主席最近提出的“在某种意义上来说，最聪明、最有才能的，是最有实践经验的战士”的教导，是一个颠扑不破的真理。在向战士请教过程中，我不仅认真地学习他们崇高的思想和优秀的革命品质，而且还主动地向他们敞思想，亮私心，斗官气，诚恳地、虚心地接受他们的批评，把同志们的每一条意见都当作围歼“官”气的一颗子弹，把大家每一次批评都看成是围歼“官”气的一场战斗。一年来，我以“老三篇”为武器，以战士为榜样，在斗私心、打官气的问题上前进了一步。
    广大干部、战士思想觉悟很高，革命精神很强，实践经验很丰富。他们对毛主席的深厚的阶级感情，增强了我对毛主席的忠和爱；他们狠学狠用“老三篇”、改造世界观的高标准，使我坚定了自我改造的决心；他们的丰富经验，提高了我搞好工作的信心。我进一步认识到：只有到群众中去，才能认清“官”气的危害，才能加深对“官”气的憎恨，才能彻底打掉“官”气。
      抓住一闪念，狠挖“官”气的老根
    经过斗争，我的官气大为减少，但是在一些“小事情”、“小问题”上，还常有表现。官气和个人权威思想还在脑子里闪来闪去。特别是当听到有些同志对我敢于斗官气、不断斗官气表示称赞的时候，便产生了满足情绪。认为那些“无关大局”的“小问题”，“说得过去”的“小事情”，没有必要小题大作。我带着这个问题学习了毛主席“世界观的转变是一个根本的转变”的教导和林副主席的有关指示，认识到：以官气斗官气，是斗不掉官气的，必须以“老三篇”为武器，在灵魂深处爆发革命，抓住“官”气的一闪念，猛打进攻战。
    第一，抓住“无关大局”的一闪念猛批猛斗。有一次，后勤部门要处理一批不能使用的老牛。我的意见是，把这批老牛卖掉，另外再买回几头耕牛来使用。事情就这么定了。我出差回来，看到这些牛还没有处理。后勤部门的同志说：政委不同意这样处理。他认为，还是在内部处理好。我一听，脑子热了一下，心想：我这个团长，连处理几头牛都决定不了，以后，其他事情还听不听我的？心里总感到有点不舒服。在学习中，我总认为这是无关大局、不伤大体的小事，一直没有讲。学习了毛主席关于领导方法的指示后，我认识到，政委掌握政策、照顾内外影响的作法是完全正确的，而自己不满意的实质是“私”字露头，个人权威思想作怪。这种“无关大局”的一闪念，事情虽小，闪的时间虽短，却把“私”字和“官”字这个“敌人”暴露出来了。是斗还是不斗？是公开地斗还是悄悄地斗？是歼灭还是击溃？这是对共产党员阶级觉悟的最实际的检验。于是，在一次党委斗私批修会上，我主动地、大胆地把这个“私”字一闪念揪出来，摆到桌面上，放到群众之中，狠批猛斗。
    第二，抓住“说得过去”的一闪念猛批猛斗。有一次夜间，我从司令部楼下经过，楼上一个参谋爬在窗口上，很随便地招呼我说：“团长！有新的情况，赶快上来，我和你说说。”听到这话，我很反感，便上楼狠狠地训了他一顿。我认为：我是团长，你是参谋，有事你应该下楼向我报告，不应该随随便便地叫我上楼。你有毛病，我批评你是应当的，是“说得过去”的。后来，通过学习毛主席的有关指示和教导，我才认识到自己这种“说得过去”的想法是错误的，训人的做法更是错误的。从当时情况看，值班簿在楼上，上楼看看值班簿，就会对情况了解得更清楚；楼上人多，和大家一起商量研究，就会对情况处理得更正确；情况是紧急的，在楼上处理更能争取时间；也只有在楼上研究，才不致泄露军事机密。所以，参谋叫我上楼是有道理的。但为什么自己又认为批评他是“说得过去”的呢？这完全是官气作怪，归根到底，又是“私”字起了作用。
    我进一步想到，这位参谋随随便便和自己打招呼，正说明他没有把自己当成外人，这正反映了亲密无间的上下级关系；而我却唯恐下级和自己平起平坐，这不正是把自己和群众隔开了吗？上楼下楼虽然是一字之差，实质上反映了是当人民勤务员还是当官做老爷，是为公还是为私。事情虽小却反映了大问题。于是，我揪住了这种“说得过去”的一闪念，在机关干部会上作了检查，并当面向这位参谋道了歉。
    第三，抓住斗“私”过程中的一闪念猛批猛斗。近一两年来，讲用会开得很普遍，我参加的讲用会也比较多，但是，亮私、斗私并不是很彻底的。表面看来，亮私、斗私也很大胆，也很爽朗，但是内心往往却在亮私的分寸上，斗私的程度上打圈子。容易考虑别人的反映怎么样，满意不满意，通得过通不过？通过学习毛主席关于在无产阶级专政下继续革命的理论，和林副主席有关破私立公的指示，以及蔡永祥、吕祥璧、年四旺等英雄榜样，我反复想：他们参加革命的时间没有我久，但是他们对党的贡献比我大；他们受党教育的时间没有我多，但是他们的思想境界比我高。这些年轻的同志，为什么成了我们这个时代的英雄人物呢？最根本的，就是他们无限忠于毛主席，无限忠于毛泽东思想，无限忠于毛主席的革命路线；就是他们能够完全彻底地斗私批修，完全彻底地当人民的勤务员。而我正是在“忠”字和“公”字上还有差距。在斗“私”字的过程中，还缺乏革命的彻底性。要想根除头脑里的“私”字，就要向这些英雄人物学习，在斗“私”中敢于打进攻战，做一个彻底的革命者。
    长时期来正面和反面的经验，使我体会到：斗“官”气的最强大的思想武器是“老三篇”，最好的场所是到群众中去。只有狠学狠用“老三篇”，只有到群众斗争中去接受锻炼和考验，才能彻底打掉“官”气，灭掉私心，才能永远保持普通一兵的本色。
