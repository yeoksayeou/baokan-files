The revolutionary committee of Pinggu County, Beijing, has fully utilized the roles of revolutionary cadre representatives, military representatives, and revolutionary mass representatives, uniting the three forces into one, and effectively leading the revolution and production of the entire county.

Chairman Mao recently instructed us: "The basic experience of the revolutionary committees is that there are representatives of revolutionary cadres, representatives of the military, and representatives of the revolutionary masses, realizing the three-in-one combination. The revolutionary committees should implement unified leadership, break down the overlapping administrative structures, streamline the bureaucracy, and organize a revolutionary leadership team that is connected with the masses."

The revolutionary committee of Pinggu County has fully utilized the roles of revolutionary cadre representatives, military representatives, and revolutionary mass representatives, established a new revolutionary style, and created a vibrant and lively work atmosphere. The "three-in-one" revolutionary committee has shown great power and strong vitality.

A leadership team that emphasizes politics and connects with the masses

In the county revolutionary committee, there are fifteen non-full-time revolutionary mass representatives. The standing committee members of the revolutionary committee genuinely respect them and firmly rely on them. Besides participating in the meetings of the county revolutionary committee to discuss and decide on major issues, they also take turns to be on duty for five days each month, responsible for understanding the situation, receiving visitors, and handling problems. These comrades, who are both "officials" and "common people," are the bonds that closely connect the revolutionary committee with the masses. They often reflect the opinions and demands of the masses to the revolutionary committee and, at the same time, bring the calls and resolutions of the revolutionary committee to the masses.

Revolutionary mass representatives usually participate in collective labor and often engage with the masses, understanding their wishes and demands. Therefore, they can timely propose good suggestions. Revolutionary mass representative Zhang Fengying learned that some villages had fewer Mao Zedong Thought study classes, with large-scale classes that were inconvenient for the elderly and weak to participate in, and also inconvenient for the masses to speak freely, affecting in-depth discussions on issues. She suggested establishing more small-scale study classes. This suggestion promoted the mass movement of studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought throughout the county. Poor and lower-middle peasant representative and deputy director of the county revolutionary committee Li Shulin, once returned from a meeting in the city, noticed that a neighboring county had more manure piles in the fields, while Pinggu County had fewer. At the same time, many poor and lower-middle peasants reported to him that some cadres were afraid to manage affairs, and some community members had developed anarchist tendencies. He connected the two issues and thought that this was a problem with the leadership team. He suggested that the county revolutionary committee vigorously rectify and strengthen the basic-level leadership teams. The county revolutionary committee sent over 200 Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams to assist in the work of places that needed to strengthen their leadership teams, quickly solving the leadership team problems of these production brigades and teams, and promoting the revolution and production in the area.

The broad revolutionary masses are very satisfied with having their own representatives participating in the revolutionary committee. Some community members said: "Poor and lower-middle peasant representatives entering the county revolutionary committee to manage state affairs have made the Party and government even more closely connected with us masses." Therefore, they have more trust and care for the county's political power organs.

After the military representatives joined the three-in-one combination, they brought the fine traditions of the People's Liberation Army into the county revolutionary committee, such as actively studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought, emphasizing proletarian politics, adhering to the four firsts, and promoting the three-eighths style.

The military representatives also brought the spirit of swift action into the revolutionary committee. Every time they received instructions from higher authorities, they would immediately convey them without washing their faces, eating, or sleeping. Since the establishment of the revolutionary committee, the transmission of Chairman Mao's instructions has been done without delay. Revolutionary cadre Du Jinzi deeply felt that since he started working in the revolutionary committee, he has strongly felt that the current situation is completely different from the old county committee. The PLA comrades implement political leadership, have a democratic style, and personally handle phone calls and problem-solving. This is in sharp contrast to my past style of only talking and not acting.

Revolutionary young people deeply feel the role of revolutionary cadres in the revolutionary committee. On January 20th of last year, the various revolutionary organizations of Pinggu County established the "Seizure of Power Committee," taking control of the county's party, government, financial, and cultural affairs. At that time, because revolutionary cadres were not invited to participate, it was quite difficult to carry out the work. After revolutionary cadres joined the three-in-one combination, revolutionary young people respected them very much. They made good contributions in grasping class struggle, policy implementation, and other aspects. For example, when studying the strengthening of basic-level leadership teams, revolutionary cadres proposed that the leadership teams at all levels should be established in the midst of revolutionary criticism, using ideological construction to promote organizational construction. This opinion greatly inspired the revolutionary young people and played a significant role in establishing revolutionary basic-level leadership teams throughout the county.

Through the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, revolutionary cadres have touched their souls. They have made significant improvements in their style. For example, the director of the county revolutionary committee and revolutionary cadre representative Yang Peiqian, when going to the countryside, eats, lives, and works with the poor and lower-middle peasants. Before the community members get up, he has already started sweeping the streets. The poor and lower-middle peasants praised him, saying: "He is truly a cadre who serves the people, not the style of a 'county magistrate'."

A tightly-knit, vigorous fighting collective

The revolutionary committee of Pinggu County not only pays attention to fully utilizing the roles of the three representatives but also strengthens mutual cooperation, making everyone closely united on the basis of Mao Zedong Thought, uniting the three forces into one, and building the revolutionary committee into a strong fighting collective.

The members of the revolutionary committee pay attention to acting according to Chairman Mao's instructions: "All members of the revolutionary ranks should care for, love, and help each other." The relationship between old and new cadres, standing committee members and committee members, military and civilians can be correctly handled, and everyone can achieve unity of thought and action.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "Intra-party criticism is a weapon for strengthening the Party's organization and increasing the Party's fighting capacity." "We have the weapon of criticism and self-criticism of Marxism-Leninism. We can eliminate bad styles and maintain good styles." The comrades of the Pinggu County Revolutionary Committee follow Chairman Mao's teachings, often using the sharp weapon of "unity-criticism and self-criticism-unity" to overcome differences in opinions, continuously improve work. This is in sharp contrast to the practice of a small clique of capitalist roaders in the old county committee who concealed contradictions, concealed mistakes, and did not put problems on the table. In this regard, the revolutionary young people's spirit of daring to think, speak, and fight has played a good role.

The director of the revolutionary committee, Yang Peiqian, is quite busy with work, and sometimes he cannot go down to the grassroots level. When poor and lower-middle peasants come to the county to find him, they often cannot find him. At this time, the mass representatives tell him: "You should go down and walk around, look around." And tell him where to go and what problems to solve.

There was a time when a mass representative participated less in labor and became a non-full-time committee member. Military representative Zhang Wenjun and revolutionary cadre Yang Peiqian talked to him about his thoughts, helping him realize that: "Detaching from production also means detaching from the masses, losing representativeness." This mass representative happily returned to the production post.

Because the revolutionary committee cares for and helps each other politically, the atmosphere of criticism and self-criticism is very strong. When holding meetings, everyone can express their opinions freely, and sometimes they argue fiercely. However, in the end, they achieve unity of understanding based on Mao Zedong Thought. Therefore, after making decisions, everyone can boldly and responsibly carry out work, effectively leading the revolution and production of the entire county.

Because the "three-in-one" revolutionary committee has established a blood-and-flesh relationship with the masses, emphasized proletarian politics, and also strongly promoted the ideological revolutionization of the entire county's people. Now, the mass movement of studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought in the entire county has entered a new stage. Not only are there Mao Zedong Thought study classes in every village and team, but there are also many kang-side study groups, family study classes, and other study organizations. By March 15th, the entire county had established more than 5,000 study classes of various types, with over 200,000 participants. Great Mao Zedong Thought has armed the masses, and good deeds for the revolution are constantly emerging. "Selflessly devoted to others" stories are endless, and following Chairman Mao's instructions has become the social norm.

The revolutionization of people's thoughts has strongly promoted the socialist construction of the entire county. The broad masses of community members take the lead in heavy work and let others do the light work, consciously doing a good job in collective production. Many long-term backward teams have entered the ranks of advanced units, and some advanced units have created new achievements.

    用毛泽东思想挂帅把革委会建成朝气蓬勃的坚强的战斗集体
    平谷县革命三结合政权显示巨大威力
    县革委会充分发挥革命干部代表、军队代表和革命群众代表的作用，三股力量拧成一股绳，有力地领导着全县的革命和生产
    毛主席最近教导我们：“革命委员会的基本经验有三条：一条是有革命干部的代表，一条是有军队的代表，一条是有革命群众的代表，实现了革命的三结合。革命委员会要实行一元化的领导，打破重叠的行政机构，精兵简政，组织起一个革命化的联系群众的领导班子。”
    北京市平谷县革命委员会充分发挥革命干部代表、军队代表、革命群众代表的作用，树立了崭新的革命作风，创造了朝气蓬勃、生动活泼的工作局面。“三结合”的革命委员会显示出巨大的威力和强大的生命力。
    突出政治、联系群众的领导班子
    县革命委员会中，有十五名不脱产的革命群众代表。革委会常委切实尊重他们，坚决依靠他们。他们除参加县革委会会议讨论决定各项重大问题外，每月还轮流值班五天，负责了解情况，接待来访，处理问题。这些同志“既当‘官’，又当老百姓”，是革命委员会与群众紧密联系的纽带。他们经常把群众的意见和要求反映到革命委员会来，同时把革命委员会的号召、决议带到群众中去。
    革命群众代表平时参加集体劳动，经常在群众中活动，对群众的愿望和要求很了解，因此能及时提出很好的建议。革命群众代表张凤英了解到，有的村毛泽东思想学习班数目少，规模大，年老体弱的人不便参加，也不便于群众普遍发言，影响对问题深入讨论。她就建议多办各种小型学习班。这一建议对于全县活学活用毛泽东思想的群众运动起了促进作用。贫下中农代表、县革命委员会副主任李树林，有一次从市里开会回来，在路上发现邻县地里的粪堆多，平谷县的少。正好在这时候，有不少贫下中农向他反映：有的干部不敢管事，有些社员滋长了无政府主义。他把两件事联系起来，想到这是领导班子的问题。他就建议县革委会大力整顿和健全基层领导班子。县革委会派出二百多人的毛泽东思想宣传队，到需要健全领导班子的地方协助开展工作，使这些生产大队和生产队的领导班子问题很快得到解决，推动了当地的革命和生产。
    广大革命群众对于有自己的代表参加革委会很满意。有的社员说：“贫下中农代表进县革委会管理国家大事，党和政府同我们群众更加心连心了。”因此，他们对县的政权机构更加信任，更加爱护。
    军队代表参加三结合以后，把人民解放军活学活用毛泽东思想，突出无产阶级政治，坚持四个第一，大兴三八作风等优良传统，带进了县革命委员会。解放军代表身体力行，带动县革命委员会建立了“天天读”等学习制度，树立了学用结合的好学风。
    解放军代表还把雷厉风行的作风带进了革命委员会。他们每次接受上级的指示回来，不洗脸，不吃饭，不睡觉，也要先把上级指示传达下去。自从革命委员会成立以来，传达毛主席的历次指示都做到了不过夜。革命干部杜金子深有感触地说：从我进革命委员会工作第一天起，就强烈地感到现在和旧县委的时候截然不同了。解放军同志实行政治领导，作风民主，打电话、处理问题都亲自动手。这和我过去只动嘴不动手的作风形成鲜明对照。
    革命干部在革命委员会中的作用，革命小将们体会最深。去年一月二十日，平谷县各革命组织就成立了“夺权委员会”，掌握了全县党政财文大权。当时因为没有吸收革命干部参加，开展工作相当困难。革命干部参加“三结合”以后，革命小将很尊重他们。他们在抓阶级斗争、掌握政策等方面都作出了很好的贡献。例如，在研究健全基层领导班子的时候，革命干部提出，各级领导班子要在革命大批判中建立，用思想建设带动组织建设。这个意见，对革命小将有很大启发，对于在全县建立革命化的基层领导班子起了很大作用。
    通过无产阶级文化大革命运动，革命干部触及了自己的灵魂。他们在作风方面比过去有很大改进。例如，县革命委员会主任、革命干部代表杨培先到农村去时，和贫下中农同吃、同住、同劳动，社员还没有起床，他就起来扫大街了。贫下中农赞扬说：他真是为人民服务的干部，可不是“县太爷”的作风。
      紧密团结、朝气蓬勃的战斗集体
    平谷县革命委员会，不但注意充分发挥三方面代表的作用，而且注意加强彼此的协作配合，使大家在毛泽东思想的基础上紧密团结，把三股力量拧成一股绳，把革委会建设成一个坚强的战斗集体。
    县革委会成员之间，都注意按照毛主席的教导办事：“一切革命队伍的人都要互相关心，互相爱护，互相帮助。”新老干部、常委和委员、军民之间的关系，都能正确处理，大家能够作到思想统一，行动一致。
    毛主席教导我们：“党内批评是坚强党的组织、增加党的战斗力的武器。”“我们有批评和自我批评这个马克思列宁主义的武器。我们能够去掉不良作风，保持优良作风。”平谷县革命委员会的同志遵循毛主席这些教导，经常运用“团结——批评和自我批评——团结”这个锐利武器，克服彼此的意见分歧，不断地改进工作。这同旧县委内一小撮走资派搞的那种掩饰矛盾，掩饰错误，有问题不摆到桌面上来的作法是鲜明的对比。在这方面，革命小将敢想、敢说、敢于斗争的精神，起了很好的作用。
    革委会主任杨培先工作较忙，有时候下不去，贫下中农到县里来找他，也往往找不见。这时候群众代表就对他说：你又该下去走一走，看一看了。并且告诉他到什么地方，解决什么问题。
    有一位群众代表，有一段时间参加劳动少了，变成了脱产委员。军队代表张文俊、革命干部杨培先就找他谈思想，帮助他认识到：脱离了生产也就脱离了群众，失去了代表性。这个群众代表就愉快地回到了生产岗位。
    由于革命委员会内部在政治上互相关心，互相帮助，批评和自我批评的空气很浓，开起会来，大家都能各抒己见，有时还争论得很厉害。但是，最后在毛泽东思想基础上统一了认识。所以，作出决定以后，大家都能大胆负责地开展工作，有力地领导全县的革命和生产。
    由于“三结合”的革命委员会和群众建立了血肉相连的关系，突出了无产阶级政治，也有力地促进了全县人民的思想革命化。现在，全县活学活用毛泽东思想的群众运动进入了一个崭新的阶段。不仅村村队队都办了毛泽东思想学习班，而且出现了许多炕头学习组、家庭学习班等学习组织。截至三月十五日，全县已经办起各种不同类型的学习班五千多所，参加学习的达二十多万人次。伟大的毛泽东思想武装了群众，一心为革命的好人好事不断涌现，“毫不利己专门利人”的事迹层出不穷，按毛主席的教导办事成了社会风气。
    人的思想革命化，有力地推动了全县的社会主义建设。广大社员见重活就抢，见轻活就让，自觉地搞好集体生产。一些多年的落后队跃入了先进行列，一些先进单位又创造了新的成绩。
