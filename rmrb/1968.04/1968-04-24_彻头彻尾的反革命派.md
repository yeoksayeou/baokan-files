Our great teacher Chairman Mao teaches us: “Whoever stands on the side of the revolutionary people is a revolutionary, and whoever stands on the side of imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucrat capitalism is a counterrevolutionary.”

The Soviet revisionist renegade clique, in the recent struggle of the American black people against violence, has completely stood on the side of American imperialism, acting as the number one accomplice of American imperialism in trying to extinguish the flames of the black people’s struggle. This once again exposes their thoroughly counterrevolutionary, shameless faces.

When the American black masses rise up against violence, they curse them viciously, labeling the black people’s just struggle as “racial riots” and “blind use of violence,” going to great lengths to slander them.

When the American ruling class sends tens of thousands of police and military to carry out bloody suppression of the blacks, they cheer loudly, praising such savage behavior as “restoring order” and “reestablishing peace,” and doing their utmost to exonerate American imperialism of its crimes.

When the American ruling class tries to lead the black people’s struggle onto the so-called “nonviolent” path, they loudly advocate the “nonviolent” road, wanting the American black masses to disarm in the face of counterrevolutionary violence.

When the American ruling class tries to deceive the black masses with tricks like the so-called “Civil Rights Act,” they eagerly promote it, wanting the American black people to believe this is a “concession” by the American ruling authorities.

In short, when American imperialism plays its two-faced counterrevolutionary strategy against the blacks, the Soviet revisionist renegade clique follows suit, collaborating closely!

The Soviet revisionist renegade clique’s jumping out to perform this shameful act is, of course, not accidental.

The line that this bunch of renegades follows is to carry out capitalist restoration in the socialist world and to maintain the rule of imperialism and colonialism in the capitalist world. When they see that the storm of the American black people’s struggle has severely struck the reactionary rule of American imperialism and shaken the imperialist and colonialist system, how can they not feel extremely anxious and rush out to help American imperialism?

This bunch of renegades, like their American imperialist bosses, are sitting on a volcano. The American blacks rising up in rebellion, smashing the so-called “order” of the reactionaries, not only frightens the lords in the White House but also frightens the small clique of revisionist clowns riding on the heads of the Soviet people. The Soviet revisionist renegade clique sees the American black people’s struggle against violence as a great crime, hating and fearing it, which completely reveals their reactionary bourgeois nature.

This bunch of renegades is wearing the same pants as their American imperialist bosses. The misfortunes of American imperialism are also the worries of the Soviet revisionist clique. Currently, the biggest headache for American imperialism is: the disastrous defeat in the Vietnam War, the worsening of the dollar crisis, and the rise of the black people’s struggle. Thus, the Soviet revisionist renegades are doing everything they can to run errands for them. They help American imperialism push the “peace talks” scam to try to rescue the American aggressors’ failure in Vietnam; they help American imperialism ease the dollar crisis, not hesitating to further open the Soviet market; they help American imperialism extinguish the flames of the black people’s struggle to maintain American imperialism’s reactionary rule at home. However, no matter how hard the Soviet revisionist renegade clique tries to help, it is all in vain. They can neither save American imperialism nor save themselves.

### 彻头彻尾的反革命派

    彻头彻尾的反革命派
    我们的伟大导师毛主席教导说：“什么人站在革命人民方面，他就是革命派，什么人站在帝国主义封建主义官僚资本主义方面，他就是反革命派。”
    苏修叛徒集团在最近美国黑人抗暴斗争当中，完全站在美帝国主义方面，充当美帝国主义扑灭黑人斗争烈火的头号帮凶，这就再一次暴露出了他们那副彻头彻尾的反革命派的无耻嘴脸。
    美国黑人群众起来抗暴，他们就恶毒咒骂，把黑人的正义斗争污蔑为“种族骚乱”、“盲目采取暴力”，极尽诽谤之能事。
    美国统治集团出动了几万军警对黑人进行血腥镇压，他们就高声喝采，把这种野蛮行为美化为“建立秩序”、恢复“平静”，竭力为美帝开脱罪责。
    美国统治集团妄想把黑人斗争引入所谓“非暴力”的歧途，他们就大肆鼓吹“非暴力”的道路，要美国黑人群众在反革命暴力面前解除武装。
    美国统治集团妄想用所谓“民权法案”之类的骗局愚弄黑人群众，他们就竭力为之宣扬，要美国黑人相信这是美国统治当局的“让步”。
    总之，在美帝国主义对黑人玩弄反革命两手策略的时候，苏修叛徒集团亦步亦趋，配合得好不密切！
    苏修叛徒集团跳出来作这一番丑恶的表演，当然不是偶然的。
    这一伙叛徒所执行的路线，本来就是在社会主义世界实行资本主义复辟，在资本主义世界维护帝国主义、殖民主义的统治。当他们看到美国黑人斗争风暴沉重地打击了美帝国主义的反动统治，冲击了帝国主义、殖民主义制度的时候，怎么会不感到万分焦虑，连忙出来助美帝国主义一臂之力呢？
    这一伙叛徒同美帝国主义一样，是坐在火山口上的。美国黑人起来造反，砸烂反动派的所谓“秩序”，不但吓坏了白宫的老爷们，也吓坏了骑在苏联老百姓头上的一小撮修正主义小丑们。苏修叛徒集团把美国黑人抗暴斗争看作大逆不道，又恨又怕，这完全是出于他们反动资产阶级的本性。
    这一伙叛徒同他们的主子美国老板穿着连裆裤。美帝国主义的灾难，也就是苏修集团的苦恼。目前美帝国主义最伤脑筋的是：侵越战争的惨败，美元危机的恶化，黑人斗争的勃兴。于是，苏修叛徒们就千方百计地为之奔走效劳。他们一帮美帝推售“和谈”骗局，企图挽救美国侵略者在越南的失败；二帮美帝缓和美元危机，不惜进一步开放苏联的市场；三帮美帝扑灭黑人斗争的烈火，以维护美帝在国内的反动统治。但是，不管苏修叛徒集团怎样卖力帮忙，都是徒劳的。他们既救不了美帝国主义的命，也救不了自己的命。
