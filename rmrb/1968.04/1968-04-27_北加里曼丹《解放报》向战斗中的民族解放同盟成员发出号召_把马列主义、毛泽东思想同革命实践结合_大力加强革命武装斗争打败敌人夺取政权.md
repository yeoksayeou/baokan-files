The Liberation News of North Kalimantan recently published an editorial calling on members of the National Liberation Alliance of North Kalimantan to combine Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought with local revolutionary practice, develop armed revolutionary struggle, and defeat the neo-colonialist puppet regime of "Malaysia," which is a tool of American and British imperialism.

The editorial states: "Mao Zedong is the Lenin of our time. Mao Zedong Thought is the Marxism-Leninism of the era when imperialism is heading towards total collapse and socialism is advancing towards worldwide victory."

The editorial continues: "If we look at the current class struggle situation in the world, in any country or region where the people have grasped and applied Mao Zedong Thought, the liberation struggle in that country or region will develop rapidly and vigorously, and will continuously achieve victories."

The editorial states: "The revolution we are currently waging is to overthrow the reactionary regime of 'Malaysia.' We must, through our own struggle, defeat the reactionary regime of 'Malaysia' and achieve victory. The most important thing is to master Mao Zedong Thought. By combining Mao Zedong Thought with our country's revolutionary practice, we will definitely be able to defeat all the reactionaries of 'Malaysia,' achieve a resounding victory, carry the national democratic revolution in North Kalimantan to the end, and build North Kalimantan into a new society without oppression and exploitation."

The editorial states: "We must use Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon to expose all the political conspiracies of the enemy, break through the enemy's propaganda offensive, and use Mao Zedong's strategy and tactics of people's war to develop our guerrilla warfare, defeat the enemy, seize power, and build a new democratic state."

The editorial concludes: "We must use Mao Zedong Thought to propagate among the masses, organize the masses, arm the masses, and fully mobilize the masses. We must bring out the creativity and initiative of the masses, resolutely and thoroughly smash 'Malaysia,' and annihilate all enemies on the soil of North Kalimantan."
