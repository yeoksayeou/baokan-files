Members of the Revolutionary Committee of the Jin District in Shanghai's Zhabei District, following Chairman Mao's instructions, have gone deep into the grassroots and led the masses in persistently carrying out revolutionary criticism. They have seized the initiative in class struggle and launched attacks on the enemy.

According to a report from Xinhua News Agency in Shanghai on April 14, after the establishment of the Revolutionary Committee of the Jin District in Shanghai's Zhabei District, all members repeatedly studied Chairman Mao's great instruction to "be both an official and a common person" and also studied the "Several Regulations on Seriously Changing Work Styles" issued by the Revolutionary Committee of Shandong Province. They decided that among the eleven committee members and eight ordinary cadres, only one committee member and two cadres would stay above to handle daily work, while the rest would go deep into the masses, take root in the grassroots, and implement the "three together" policy: working, studying Chairman Mao's works, and criticizing revisionism together with the masses.

The committee members went to twelve grassroots stores and workshops, taking class struggle as the key link, and carried out revolutionary criticism with the masses. They found that in some units, the number of participants in criticism meetings was small, the masses were not widely mobilized, and the content of the criticism was somewhat empty. To address these issues, the district committee, following Chairman Mao's instruction to "organize tens of thousands and millions of people and mobilize a surging revolutionary army," decided to launch a "people's war" of revolutionary criticism with the committee members and the masses. They, together with the revolutionary masses in the grassroots stores, used the invincible Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon, combined with the actual class struggle in their industry and unit, and launched a deep exposure and criticism of the counter-revolutionary revisionist black goods spread by the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents in Shanghai. During the criticism of the class capitulationist line of the Chinese Khrushchev, a committee member of the district committee took the lead in exposing the crimes of a reactionary bourgeois element in the industry who always attempted to restore capitalism and launched a ferocious attack on the party and socialism. Using Mao Zedong Thought, he severely criticized the "class struggle extinction" theory spread by the Chinese Khrushchev. Following his lead, all the revolutionary workers in the store concentrated their firepower and targeted the Chinese Khrushchev, raising the level of criticism. Throughout the district, the "study every day, criticize everyone" activity focused on criticizing the revisionist black goods advocated by the Chinese Khrushchev, such as "profit-first" and "target-first"; criticizing the class capitulationist line of beautifying and praising the bourgeoisie; criticizing the counter-revolutionary revisionist party-building line, as well as the reactionary theories of "tame tool" and "public-private fusion," etc. Through a series of thematic criticisms, the class struggle and line struggle consciousness of the broad revolutionary workers were greatly enhanced.

The committee members and cadres of the district committee also led the revolutionary masses in the grassroots stores to take the initiative to launch attacks on the class enemies. In the Xinsheng Grinding Wheel Products Store, there was once a surge of counter-revolutionary economism and anarchism, and there was a lack of unity among the workers. A committee member of the district committee working there, together with the revolutionary masses, studied Chairman Mao's instruction: "The imperialists and domestic reactionaries will not readily accept their defeat. They will make their last struggle. After the country is pacified, they will still engage in sabotage and disruption in various ways every day and every hour, trying to restore their rule in China. This is inevitable and undeniable. We must not relax our vigilance." Under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, the revolutionary masses of the store, through thorough and detailed investigation and research, discovered that there were indeed bad elements engaging in sabotage activities. The district committee immediately mobilized the masses to expose this bad element who had infiltrated the revolutionary rebel ranks and carried out a struggle of criticism. The broad masses of workers received a living lesson in class struggle, actively resisted anarchism, and struck down the bourgeois evil winds, greatly enhancing the revolutionary spirit of the proletariat. The workers of the entire store strengthened their revolutionary unity and created a new situation of joint struggle against the enemy.

After the committee members of the district committee went to the grassroots stores, they also paid attention to mobilizing the masses to seriously deal with the class struggle reflected in customers' purchases of goods. In the second half of last year, raising goldfish and making fish tanks became a trend in society, and many people went to hardware stores and glass stores to buy glass and nails, including many young people. After discovering this abnormal situation, the district committee, following Chairman Mao's instruction that "political work is the lifeline of all economic work," promptly organized the workers to study Chairman Mao's works and analyze and study this situation. After studying, the workers realized that some young people's enthusiasm for raising fish and buying goldfish tanks was influenced by bourgeois ideology, which was an attempt by the bourgeoisie to corrupt the revolutionary will of young people and a manifestation of their struggle to win over the younger generation; the class enemies' inducement of young people to raise fish was also a means for them to disrupt the resumption of classes and revolutionary criticism, which was a serious class struggle. After clarifying their understanding, they decided to carry out propaganda activities of Mao Zedong Thought at the counter. The clerks enthusiastically propagated Chairman Mao's latest instructions to the young people, awakening them not to be fooled by the bourgeoisie and to quickly resume classes and make revolution. Some clerks also went to the alleys to propagate. This series of propaganda activities achieved remarkable results, and the phenomenon of young people buying glass fish tanks quickly disappeared.

Through carrying out revolutionary criticism with the revolutionary masses, the Revolutionary Committee of the Jin District in Zhabei District established proletarian revolutionary authority in the storm of class struggle, and the masses loved and supported the committee even more.

    上海闸北区五金区店革委会成员遵照毛主席教导深入基层
    带领群众持久开展革命大批判
    狠抓阶级斗争主动向敌人进攻
    据新华社上海十四日电　上海市闸北区五金区店革命委员会成员，深入基层商店狠抓阶级斗争，带领广大革命群众，深入持久地开展革命大批判，坚决打击阶级敌人，提高了广大群众阶级斗争和路线斗争觉悟，全区各五金店的革命、工作都出现了新面貌。
    闸北区五金区店革命委员会成立后，全体成员反复学习了毛主席的“既当‘官’，又当老百姓”的伟大指示，又学习了《山东省革命委员会关于认真转变作风的若干规定》，决定十一个委员和八个一般干部中，除留一个委员和两个干部在上面处理日常工作外，其他的人都深入群众，扎根基层，实行“三同”：同群众一起劳动，一起学习毛主席著作，一起批判修正主义。
    革委会委员们分别下到十二个基层商店和工场，以阶级斗争为纲，与群众一起开展革命的大批判。他们下去后发现有的单位开批判会参加的人不多，群众发动的面不广，批判的内容比较空洞。针对这些问题，区店革委会遵照毛主席“组织千千万万的民众，调动浩浩荡荡的革命军，是今天的革命向反革命进攻的需要”的教导，决定由革委会成员和群众在一起开展“天天学，人人批”的活动，打一场革命大批判的“人民战争”。他们同基层商店的革命群众一道，以战无不胜的毛泽东思想为武器，结合本行业、本单位的阶级斗争实际，对中国赫鲁晓夫及其在上海的代理人散布的反革命修正主义黑货，展开了深入的揭发、批判。北站五金商店革命职工在批判中国赫鲁晓夫的阶级投降主义路线的时候，区店革委会的一个委员，带头揭发了本行业一个反动资产阶级分子时刻妄图复辟资本主义，向党、向社会主义猖狂进攻的罪行，用毛泽东思想狠狠批判了中国赫鲁晓夫散布的“阶级斗争熄灭”论。在他的带动下，全店革命职工集中火力，集中目标，向中国赫鲁晓夫猛烈开火，把大批判的水平提高了一步。整个区店在“天天学，人人批”的活动中，着重批判了中国赫鲁晓夫鼓吹的“利润挂帅”、“指标第一”等修正主义黑货；批判了美化、吹捧资产阶级的阶级投降主义路线；批判了反革命修正主义建党路线，以及反动的“驯服工具”论、“公私溶化”论等等。通过一系列的专题批判，极大地提高了广大革命职工的阶级斗争和路线斗争觉悟。
    区店革委会成员和干部在基层商店还带领革命群众主动向阶级敌人发动进攻。新生砂轮制品商店一度刮起了反革命经济主义妖风，无政府主义泛滥，职工之间闹不团结。在这里工作的一位区店革委会成员就和革命群众一道学习毛主席的教导：“帝国主义者和国内反动派决不甘心于他们的失败，他们还要作最后的挣扎。在全国平定以后，他们也还会以各种方式从事破坏和捣乱，他们将每日每时企图在中国复辟。这是必然的，毫无疑义的，我们务必不要松懈自己的警惕性。”在毛泽东思想指引下，这个商店的革命群众通过深入细致的调查研究，发现确有坏人在这里搞破坏活动，区店革委会立即发动群众把这个混在革命造反派队伍中的坏人揪了出来，进行了批判斗争。广大职工受到活生生的阶级斗争的教育，自动起来抵制无政府主义，打击资产阶级的歪风邪气，无产阶级革命正气大大上升。全店职工加强了革命团结，出现了一个共同对敌的新局面。
    区店革委会成员下到基层商店后，还注意发动群众严肃对待在顾客对商品的购买上所反映出来的阶级斗争。去年下半年，社会上养金鱼、做鱼缸一度成风，到五金店、玻璃店配玻璃和买铆钉的人很多，其中有许多青少年。区店革委会发现这种异常情况后，遵照毛主席“政治工作是一切经济工作的生命线”的教导，及时组织职工学习毛主席著作，对于这种情况进行分析研究。经过学习，职工们认识到，一些青少年热中于养鱼和买金鱼缸，是受了资产阶级思想影响，这是资产阶级妄图用养鱼种花腐蚀青少年革命意志，和我们争夺年青一代的一种表现；阶级敌人引诱青少年养鱼，也是他们企图破坏复课闹革命、破坏革命大批判的一种手段，这是一场严重的阶级斗争。大家认识明确后，决定在柜台上开展宣传毛泽东思想的活动。营业员热情地向青少年宣传毛主席的最新指示，启发青少年不要上资产阶级的当，要赶快复课闹革命。有的营业员还下里弄宣传。这一系列宣传活动，收到了显著的效果，青少年买玻璃制鱼缸的现象很快消失了。
    闸北区五金区店革委会成员通过和革命群众一道开展革命大批判，使革委会在阶级斗争的风浪中建立了无产阶级革命权威，群众更加爱护、支持革委会。
