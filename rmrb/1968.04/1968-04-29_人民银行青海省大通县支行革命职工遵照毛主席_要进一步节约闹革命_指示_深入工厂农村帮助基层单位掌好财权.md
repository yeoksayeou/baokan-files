Revolutionary staff of the People's Bank of China, Datuong County, Qinghai Province, have been following Chairman Mao's instruction to "further save and make revolution." They have gone deep into factories and rural areas to assist grassroots units in managing financial power.

XINING, April 28 (Xinhua) — Revolutionary staff of the People's Bank of China, Datuong County, Qinghai Province, have been earnestly implementing Chairman Mao's great teachings on "building the country through thrift" and "saving to make revolution." They have gone deep into factories and rural areas to assist various units' revolutionary factions in carrying out Chairman Mao's instruction to "further save and make revolution." They have helped these units manage and use financial power for the proletariat.

After the revolutionary leading group of the Datuong County branch was established in November last year, they organized revolutionary staff to study Chairman Mao's series of instructions on "building the country through thrift" and "saving to make revolution." They educated the staff to strengthen class struggle awareness and fight political battles in the economic field. They deeply criticized the past economic work's purely business-oriented viewpoint, raised everyone's ideological awareness, and resolutely changed the previous situation where political work was not prominent, and only economic transactions were handled. They all walked out of the counters and offices, carrying Chairman Mao's works, and went deep into various factories, mines, enterprises, and rural areas, directly doing work at the grassroots units.

After going deep into the grassroots, they did "one propaganda, two supports, three assists" in their work. "One propaganda" means going deep into various grassroots units, vigorously propagating Chairman Mao's teachings on "building the country through thrift" and "further saving to make revolution," criticizing the bourgeoisie's extravagant and wasteful ideology and style, promoting people's ideological revolution, and promoting the increase-production-and-save-movement. "Two supports" means, according to the production situation and actual needs of various units, supporting their reasonable needs for circulating funds, supporting them to increase production and reduce costs. "Three assists" means assisting these units in implementing economic democracy and financial transparency; assisting in formulating and implementing specific measures for increase-production-and-save; establishing economic supervision organizations; assisting in timely handling and solving specific financial problems. The broad revolutionary workers and poor and lower-middle peasants all praised them as good consultants for the proletarian revolutionary factions.

In early March, staff from the Datuong County branch went to a factory. Starting from assisting the proletarian revolutionary factions in auditing the settlement since the Cultural Revolution, they helped the factory formulate an increase-production-and-save plan. They audited the settlement with class struggle awareness and found that the walking capitalist roaders in the factory, in order to gain political capital, falsely reported last year's loss as profit and illegally withdrew enterprise bonuses, promoting counter-revolutionary economism. After they exposed this incident, it gave the broad staff a profound class struggle education.

Some units' proletarian revolutionary factions, due to lack of experience in managing financial power, sometimes unconsciously violated the system. When encountering such situations, bank staff, with full enthusiasm, studied Chairman Mao's instructions with them, helping them raise their awareness. For example, a factory once planned to use production funds for basic construction, and a unit prepared to purchase items that were not urgently needed for work. These were all corrected with the help of bank staff, following the principle of thrift.

Since the establishment of the revolutionary leading group, the Datuong County branch has blocked many unreasonable expenditure requests from certain units, saving more than 180,000 yuan. They have not been satisfied with the achievements they have made and have set higher standards for themselves: first, to be good propagandists of Mao Zedong Thought; second, to be good managers of the socialist economy; third, to be good fighters in defending the proletarian financial power. They have also trained accountants for rural production teams, assisting the financial personnel of production teams in managing and using financial power for the socialist collective economy.

    人民银行青海省大通县支行革命职工遵照毛主席“要进一步节约闹革命”指示
    深入工厂农村帮助基层单位掌好财权
    新华社西宁二十八日电　中国人民银行青海省大通县支行革命职工，认真贯彻执行毛主席关于“勤俭建国”的伟大教导，深入工厂和农村，协助各单位的无产阶级革命派认真落实毛主席“要进一步节约闹革命”的指示，帮助他们为无产阶级掌好、用好财权。
    大通县支行的革命领导小组在去年十一月成立以后，就组织革命职工认真学习毛主席关于“勤俭建国”和“要节约闹革命”的一系列指示，教育职工加强阶级斗争观念，打好经济领域里面的政治仗。他们深刻地批判了过去经济工作中的单纯业务观点，提高了大家的思想觉悟，坚决改变以前不突出无产阶级政治，只是在经济上收收付付的情况，纷纷走出柜台、办公室，带着毛主席著作深入各个厂矿企业和农村，把工作直接做到基层单位去。
    他们深入基层以后，在工作中做到了“一宣二支三帮”。“一宣”，就是深入到各基层单位，大力宣传毛主席的“勤俭建国”和“要进一步节约闹革命”的教导，批判铺张浪费的资产阶级思想和作风，促进人的思想革命化，推动增产节约运动。“二支”，就是根据各单位的生产情况和他们的实际要求，支持他们对于流动资金的合理需要，支持他们增加生产，降低成本。“三帮”，就是帮助这些单位实行经济民主，财务公开；帮助制订和落实增产节约的具体措施，建立经济监督组织；帮助及时处理和解决财务上的具体问题。广大的革命工人和贫下中农都称赞他们是无产阶级革命派的好参谋。
    三月初，大通县支行工作人员到一个工厂，从协助无产阶级革命派审核文化大革命以来的决算入手，帮助工厂制订增产节约计划。他们带着阶级斗争的观念审查决算，发现这个工厂里的走资派为了捞取政治资本，将前年的一笔亏损，虚报为盈利，并非法提取了企业奖金，推行反革命经济主义。他们将这一事件揭露以后，使广大职工受到一次深刻的阶级斗争教育。
    有些单位的无产阶级革命派由于对掌好财权缺乏经验，有时也不自觉地违犯了制度。碰到这种情况，银行工作人员怀着满腔热忱，同他们一起学习毛主席的指示，帮助他们提高认识。譬如，有的工厂曾经打算动用生产资金搞基本建设，有的单位准备购买不是工作上急需的用品，都在银行工作人员帮助下得到纠正，按勤俭节约原则办事。
    大通县支行自从建立革命领导小组以来，已经先后堵住了某些单位不合理的开支要求多起，节约开支十八万多元。他们并没有满足已经取得的成绩，对自己提出了更严格的要求：一要当好毛泽东思想的宣传员，二要当好社会主义经济的管理员，三要当好保卫无产阶级财权的战斗员。他们还为农村生产队培训了会计人员，帮助生产队的财会人员为社会主义集体经济掌好、用好财权。
