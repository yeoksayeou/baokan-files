The revolutionary staff of the Guizhou Province Supply and Marketing Cooperative System are earnestly implementing Chairman Mao's great line of "seizing the revolution and promoting production." They are actively organizing and supplying agricultural tools for the spring plowing and summer harvest, contributing to the achievement of an even greater agricultural harvest this year.

As early as last December, from the provincial supply and marketing cooperative to the district supply and marketing cooperative, meetings were held at all levels to discuss the organization and supply of production materials, and plans were made. After the completion of the autumn agricultural tools supply work last year, various levels of supply and marketing cooperatives sent cadres to communes and production teams to understand the needs for spring plowing and summer harvest tools this year, and to organize supplies in a planned manner. To better meet local needs, various levels of supply and marketing cooperatives use local materials, process locally, and supply locally. At present, the inventory of medium and small agricultural tools in the entire provincial supply and marketing cooperative system is equivalent to the total supply for last year.

    贵州供销社系统为夺取农业更大丰收贡献力量
    做好春耕夏收农具组织供应工作
    贵州省供销社系统广大革命职工，认真贯彻执行毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的伟大方针，积极做好春耕、夏收农具的组织供应工作，为夺取今年农业生产的更大丰收贡献力量。
    早在去年十二月，从省供销社到区供销社，就层层召开了农业生产资料供应工作会议，作出生产资料的组织供应计划。去年“三秋”农具的组织供应工作结束以后，各级供销社就派干部深入公社、生产队，摸清今年春耕、夏收农具的需要，有计划地组织货源。为了更好地使供应的农具适合当地需要，各级供销社就地取材，就地加工，就地供应。目前全省供销社系统库存的中小型农具，相当于去年全年的供应量。
