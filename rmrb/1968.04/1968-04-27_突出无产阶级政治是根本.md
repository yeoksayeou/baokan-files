The great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "Youth should place a firm and correct political direction in the first place." Following Chairman Mao's instructions, our company has made arming the minds of young soldiers with Mao Zedong Thought and guiding the broad masses of young soldiers to firmly walk the path of emphasizing proletarian politics the center of our company's youth work. Since 1960, our company, in accordance with Chairman Mao's teachings that "politics is the commander, it is the soul," has conducted regular, lively class education for young soldiers, greatly raising the class consciousness of the broad masses of young soldiers and strengthening their class struggle awareness. Our company has been consecutively evaluated as a Four Good Company for three years.

The Chinese Khrushchev fiercely opposes political command and vigorously advocates technical command. He rants on about how "class struggle has basically ended." "Our party members, league members, and revolutionary intellectuals must work hard to study and seriously delve into their professions." The master gives the order, and the servant carries it out. The counter-revolutionary revisionist element Luo Ruiqing also loudly proclaims the fallacy of "red brains cannot match steel tanks." In 1964, he stirred up a black wind of "big competitions" throughout the army, using methods such as rewarding those who excel in skills, evaluating Five Good Soldiers, admitting to the league and party, and publishing in newspapers, dragging youth into the dead end of a purely technical viewpoint. What is even more infuriating is that he used party and league days and political classes to engage in "big competitions," and suppressed cadres and soldiers who emphasized politics. Under the onslaught of this black wind, the number of Five Good Soldiers in our company decreased, and our Four Good Company was also overturned. Comrades angrily said: "The more technical command is emphasized, the worse it gets." "Big competitions grab the bayonets and grenades but discard the spiritual atom bombs."

Since 1965, under the guidance of Vice Chairman Lin Biao's instructions on emphasizing politics, we have firmly grasped the study of Chairman Mao's works and the arming of young soldiers' minds with Mao Zedong Thought. The company's appearance has been completely renewed, and our company has been consecutively evaluated as a Four Good Company. We have deeply exposed and criticized the Chinese Khrushchev and the counter-revolutionary revisionist element Luo Ruiqing, clearly recognizing that the "technology first" path they advocate is a revisionist dead end. They want our young soldiers to forget class struggle, forget proletarian dictatorship, remove the soul from youth work, and turn youth into confused individuals who have no roots in their work, no accuracy in battle, no energy in labor, and whose heads are cut off without knowing why. Their evil goal is to overthrow proletarian dictatorship and restore capitalism.

The Chinese Khrushchev's scheme to obliterate class struggle and alter the political direction of youth work must be thoroughly smashed. We resolutely walk the path of emphasizing proletarian politics as indicated by Chairman Mao, using Mao Zedong Thought to educate youth, making each young soldier infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao, infinitely loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, and infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, becoming reliable successors to the proletarian revolutionary cause.

    突出无产阶级政治是根本
    北京卫戍区某部一连
    伟大领袖毛主席教导我们：“青年应该把坚定正确的政治方向放在第一位。”遵照毛主席的教导，我连把用毛泽东思想武装青年战士的头脑，引导广大青年战士坚定不移地走突出无产阶级政治的道路，作为连队青年工作的中心。一九六○年以来，我连根据毛主席“政治是统帅，是灵魂”的教导，对青年战士进行经常性的生动活泼的阶级教育，大大地提高了广大青年战士的阶级觉悟，增强了阶级斗争观念。我连连续三年被评为四好连队。
    中国赫鲁晓夫疯狂反对政治挂帅，极力宣扬技术挂帅。他胡说什么：“阶级斗争已经基本结束了。”“我们的党员、团员和革命知识分子，都要下苦功学习，认真钻研业务。”主子下令，奴才效劳。反革命修正主义分子罗瑞卿，也大肆鼓吹什么“红脑瓜碰不过钢坦克”的谬论。一九六四年，他在全军刮起了“大比武”的黑风，采用练好技术可以受奖、评五好、入团、入党、登报等一系列的手法，把青年拚命往单纯技术观点的死胡同里拉。更令人气愤的是，他把党团日、政治课也都用来搞“大比武”，并打击突出政治的干部、战士。在这股黑风的侵袭下，我连被评为五好战士的人数少了，我们这个四好连也被冲跨了。同志们气愤地说：“技术挂帅，越挂越坏。”“大比武是抓了刺刀手榴弹，丢了精神原子弹。”
    一九六五年以来，我们在林彪副主席关于突出政治的指示下，狠抓了毛主席著作的学习，狠抓了用毛泽东思想武装青年战士的头脑，连队面貌焕然一新，我连又连年被评为四好连队。我们对中国赫鲁晓夫和反革命修正主义分子罗瑞卿进行了深刻的揭露和批判，清楚地认识到他们所鼓吹的“技术第一”的道路是一条修正主义的死路。他们就是想让我们青年战士忘记阶级斗争，忘记无产阶级专政，抽掉青年工作的灵魂，使青年变成办事没有根、打仗没有准、干活没有劲的糊涂虫，脑袋掉了还不知怎么掉的，以达到他们颠覆无产阶级专政、复辟资本主义的罪恶目的。
    中国赫鲁晓夫抹煞阶级斗争，篡改青年工作的政治方向，这个阴谋必须彻底粉碎。我们坚决走毛主席指引的突出无产阶级政治的道路，用毛泽东思想教育青年，使每个青年战士无限忠于毛主席、无限忠于毛泽东思想、无限忠于毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，成为无产阶级革命事业的可靠接班人。
