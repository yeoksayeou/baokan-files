The dollar's hegemony is wavering, and the Franco-American rivalry is intensifying. The imperialist bloc is disintegrating and facing severe crises. According to a report from Xinhua News Agency in Paris on April 1, our correspondent reports: Under the impact of the current financial crisis in the capitalist world, the imperialist countries are engaged in a fierce struggle to shift their burdens and seize opportunities, making the already fragmented imperialist bloc even more divided. In this currency and financial war, the most prominent feature is the open confrontation between the United States and France.

American imperialism, by pursuing a policy of aggression and war worldwide, especially its frenzied invasion of Vietnam, has exacerbated its inflation, resulting in a massive deficit in its international balance of payments, and severely weakened its financial and economic strength. The status of the dollar is shaky.

France, which is vying for dominance with the United States in various fields, has no intention of going down with the dollar. It sees this as an opportune moment to overthrow the dollar's hegemony in the capitalist world, which has lasted for more than two decades since the war, and further weaken American influence. Recently, the unprecedented wave of dumping dollars and buying gold in the capitalist world forced the United States to make a decision that effectively devalued the dollar. French President Charles de Gaulle immediately issued a statement saying: "The current monetary system, which is based on the privilege of using the dollar and pound as reserve currencies, is not only unfair but also unworkable in the future." He called for "reforming" the capitalist monetary system and establishing a new monetary system based on gold, in which France would have a greater say. Otherwise, France would "reserve the right to take action." In other words, he believes that the collapse of the dollar is self-inflicted and inevitable, and the sooner it collapses, the better, to avoid dragging others down with it. De Gaulle's remarks indicate his determination to undermine the dollar's privileged status by all means.

France's challenge to the dollar's privileged status is not new. As early as September 1962, France proposed reforming the International Monetary Fund, which is controlled by the United States. In early 1965, France formally launched a challenge, proposing a series of measures aimed at overthrowing the dollar's hegemony, including: settling international payments among Western countries in gold; exchanging existing dollar reserves with the United States for gold; raising the price of gold and establishing a new "international currency" for the capitalist world to replace the dollar. Since then, de Gaulle has almost always attacked the privileged status of the dollar and pound in his semi-annual press conferences to create public opinion. At the same time, France has been continuously exchanging large amounts of dollars in its reserves for gold with the United States. This led to the emulation of certain other capitalist countries, accelerating the depletion of U.S. gold reserves and the decline of dollar credit. In 1967, France withdrew from the "gold pool" established to "defend" the dollar, dealing another heavy blow to the United States.

These developments show that in France's struggle against U.S. hegemony in the capitalist world, especially in Western Europe, the currency war is playing an increasingly important role; overthrowing the dollar's privileged status has become a very clear goal for de Gaulle. American hegemony in Western Europe has two pillars: one is the political and military control of Western Europe through the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, and the other is economic control. Although de Gaulle withdrew from the unified military command of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, seriously damaging the first pillar, he cannot overthrow American hegemony without attacking the other pillar. Striking at the dollar's privileged status is a key to striking at American economic hegemony. The French magazine *Nouvel Observateur* said on March 20: "In this struggle against American hegemony... de Gaulle gradually saw that the currency front is necessary. If victory cannot be achieved in this area, then all political achievements are illusory." According to de Gaulle's calculations, once the dollar's privileged status is overthrown and the capitalist world's monetary system is reorganized, the dollar is no longer a means of reserve for Western countries, and the United States' ability to manipulate, control, and infiltrate other countries economically will be greatly reduced. Consequently, its political and military hegemony will also be correspondingly weakened. While the six countries of the "Common Market" led by France have a total gold reserve that has surpassed the United States, and their international balance of payments is often in surplus, their position and influence in the capitalist world would relatively increase, further changing the balance of power between Western Europe and the United States.

It is precisely out of such "strategic" considerations that France refused to lend support when the pound was in crisis last winter, allowing it to devalue and thus exposing the dollar. In the recent gold-buying frenzy, according to French media reports, when the news that the London gold market was closed at the request of the United States came out on March 15, the governor of the Bank of France was momentarily panicked and prepared to close the Paris gold market. However, de Gaulle ordered it to remain open and rebuked, "Is the governor of the Bank of France still doing the United States' bidding?" On that very day, the gold price in the Paris market soared to a peak of $44 per ounce.

Currently, the Franco-American contest is continuing around two issues: one is the issue of Western European countries unilaterally reducing tariffs on U.S. imports ahead of schedule; the other is the issue of establishing a so-called "Special Drawing Right" in the International Monetary Fund that is favorable to the United States.

Not long ago, the "Kennedy Round" agreement reached by the United States with many other capitalist countries, which was originally scheduled to be implemented in 1972, now wants Western European countries to agree to start reducing tariffs on U.S. imports ahead of schedule, while the United States will still reduce tariffs on imports from Western European countries according to the original schedule in 1972, in order to unilaterally increase U.S. exports and reduce the international balance of payments deficit. Some Western European countries have verbally agreed to this U.S. demand under pressure. However, France has firmly expressed its opposition. French Finance Minister Michel Debré announced that the United States cannot always demand that Western European countries make "sacrifices" unilaterally, while it does not take truly effective measures. In this situation, the U.S. demand for Western European countries will eventually be nullified due to France's veto. As for the so-called "Special Drawing Right" that the United States has been racking its brains to establish to ease the dollar crisis, it was flatly opposed by France at the Stockholm meeting of finance ministers from ten major capitalist countries that ended on March 30. France even refused to sign the final communique of the meeting. In the future, the struggle between the United States and France, one to maintain the dollar's privileged status and the other to overthrow it, will further intensify.

The Franco-American financial and currency war reflects the deep and complex nature of the current financial crisis in the capitalist world, and it in turn makes this financial crisis even more severe and unsolvable.

    美元霸权摇摇欲坠　法美争霸愈演愈烈
    帝国主义集团分崩离析危机重重
    据新华社巴黎一日电　本社记者报道：在当前资本主义世界金融危机的打击下，帝国主义国家间转嫁困难、你争我夺的明争暗斗愈演愈烈，这使得已经四分五裂的帝国主义更加分崩离析。在这场货币金融战中，特别突出的是美国和法国的公开较量。
    美帝国主义在全世界推行侵略和战争政策，特别是疯狂进行侵越战争，加剧了它的通货膨胀，造成了国际收支的巨额亏空，使美国财政经济实力空前削弱，美元地位摇摇欲坠。
    在各个领域里正在同美国争霸的法国显然无意为美元陪葬，而且认为现在正是乘机推翻战后二十多年来美元在资本主义世界的霸权，从而进一步削弱美国的影响的大好机会。最近，资本主义世界空前猛烈的抛售美元抢购黄金的风潮，迫使美国作出了事实上让美元变相贬值的决定以后，法国总统戴高乐马上发表谈话说：“建筑在把美元英镑作为储备货币的特权的基础上的当今货币体制，不仅是不公平的，而且是今后行不通的。”他要求“革新”资本主义货币体系，建立“以黄金为基础”的法国在其中有更大发言权的新货币体系，否则，法国就要“保留行动自由”。换句话说，他认为，美元垮台是自作自受，无可避免，早些垮台更好，免得旁人陪着遭殃。戴高乐的这一谈话，表明他要千方百计挤垮美元特权地位。
    法国对美元特权地位的挑战并非最近才开始。早在一九六二年九月，法国就提出要求改革美国控制的“国际货币基金组织”；一九六五年初开始，法国正式发动了挑战，提出了一系列旨在推翻美元霸权地位的主张，包括：西方国家国际收支用黄金结算；各国现有的美元储备要向美国换成黄金；黄金提高价格和建立一种资本主义世界新的“国际货币”来代替美元等等。从此以后，戴高乐在每半年一次的记者招待会上几乎每次都要攻击美元英镑的特权地位，以不断造成舆论。与此同时，法国还不断把它储备中的大量美元向美国兑换黄金。这导致了其他某些资本主义国家的效法，加速了美国黄金储备的减少和美元信用的降低。一九六七年中，法国退出了为“保卫”美元而建立的“黄金总库”，又给了美国沉重的一击。
    这些情况表明，在法国向美国在资本主义世界、特别是在西欧的霸权挑战的角斗中，货币战越来越占有重要的位置；攻垮美元的特权地位，已成了戴高乐的一个十分明确的目标。美国在西欧的霸权有两大支柱，一是美国通过北大西洋集团对西欧的政治和军事进行控制，二是美国对西欧的经济控制。戴高乐虽然退出了北大西洋集团统一军事司令部，从而严重地损坏了第一根支柱，但如果不攻击另一根支柱，就仍然不能推翻美国霸权。而打击美元的特权地位乃是打击美国经济霸权的一大关键。法国《新观察家》杂志三月二十日在一篇文章中说得很明白：“在这场反对美国霸权的斗争中……戴高乐慢慢地看到货币战线是必要的。如果不能在这方面取得胜利，那么一切政治成就也是虚幻的。”按照戴高乐的盘算，一旦攻垮了美元的特权地位，重新改组资本主义世界货币体系，美元不再成为西方各国储备的手段以后，美国在经济上对别国进行操纵、控制、渗透的能力将大为缩小，因而在政治、军事上的霸权也将相应削弱。而以法国为首的西欧“共同市场”集团六国，因为黄金储备的总和已超过了美国，而且它们的国际收支又经常处于顺差状况，因此它们在资本主义世界的地位和影响就可能相对增强，并进一步改变西欧同美国的实力对比。
    正是出于这样的“战略性”考虑，法国在去年冬季英镑垂危的时候拒绝借款支持，听任英镑贬值，而使美元失去了掩蔽。在最近一次抢购黄金的大风暴中，据法国报刊透露，当三月十五日伦敦黄金市场应美国要求关闭的消息传出后，法兰西银行行长一时惊慌，也准备关闭巴黎金市，但是戴高乐下令照常开放，并且斥责说：“法兰西银行行长还替美国办事？”就在这一天，巴黎金市上金价上涨到了四十四美元一盎司的高峰。
    目前，法美的这场角逐正围绕着两个问题继续进行：一是关于西欧国家单方面提前对美国货进口降低关税的问题；一是关于在“国际货币基金组织”中建立对美国有利的所谓“特别提款权”问题。
    不久前，美国同其他许多资本主义国家达成的规定互减关税的“肯尼迪回合”协议，本来定于一九七二年才开始实施。但是美国为了转嫁美元危机，现在硬要西欧国家同意提前开始对美国货进口实行减税，而美国却仍然照原规定到一九七二年才对西欧国家货物进口减税，以便片面地增加美国出口、减少国际收支赤字。某些西欧国家在美国压力下口头上同意了美国这一要求。但是法国坚决表示反对。法国财长德勃雷宣布，美国不能总是要西欧国家片面作“牺牲”，而自己却不采取真正有效的措施。在这种情况下，美国对西欧国家的这一要求迟早将因法国的否决而化为泡影。至于美国为了缓和美元危机而挖空心思想建立的所谓“特别提款权”，在三月三十日结束的十个主要资本主义国家财长参加的斯德哥尔摩会议上，遭到了法国的干脆反对，法国连会议的最后公报都不愿签署。今后，美法两国之间，一个要维护美元特权地位、一个要攻垮美元特权地位的斗争，势将进一步展开。
    法美之间的金融货币战反映了当前资本主义世界金融危机的深刻、复杂，而它本身又反过来使得这一金融危机更加深重，无法解救。
