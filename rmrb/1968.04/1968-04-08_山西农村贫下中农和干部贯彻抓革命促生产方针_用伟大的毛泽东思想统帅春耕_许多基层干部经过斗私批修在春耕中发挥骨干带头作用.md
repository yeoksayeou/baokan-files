In the midst of the triumphant songs of the complete victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and on the foundation of last year's all-around bumper harvest, the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants, revolutionary masses, and revolutionary cadres in the rural areas of Shanxi Province are resolutely implementing Chairman Mao's great policy of "seizing the revolution and promoting production." They have launched a spring production high tide. Currently, the rural areas of Shanxi are bustling with activity. Activities such as fertilizing, land preparation, wheat field management, spring agricultural infrastructure construction, and cotton field preparation have all been fully deployed.

The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants, revolutionary masses, and revolutionary cadres in the rural areas of Shanxi Province have emphasized proletarian politics and used Mao Zedong Thought to guide spring production. Since the beginning of spring, from the province to many prefectures and counties, meetings of three-level and four-level cadres on spring production have been held one after another. Based on Chairman Mao's latest instructions on "holding study classes, which is a good method, many problems can be solved in study classes," the focus is on "fighting selfishness and criticizing revisionism" to hold extensive Mao Zedong Thought study classes. The province has established 38,000 Mao Zedong Thought study classes at the county, commune, and production team levels, with over 2.5 million people participating in the study. These activities have further broadened and deepened the great mass movement of studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought, making Chairman Mao's series of latest instructions deeply ingrained in people's hearts. Currently, the revolutionary criticism in the rural areas of Shanxi Province is being carried out in depth, and the broad revolutionary masses and revolutionary cadres are further purging the poison of the counter-revolutionary revisionist line of China's Khrushchev in the rural areas. Through revolutionary criticism, their class struggle and line struggle consciousness has rapidly increased, strongly promoting spring agricultural production.

The revolutionary committees, support-left committees, provincial military region, and people's armed departments of various levels in Shanxi Province have dispatched cadres to form Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams. They go to the countryside to live, eat, work, study, and fight selfishness and criticize revisionism with the masses, widely propagating Mao Zedong Thought and the party's policies. The provincial leadership organs have dispatched over 2,000 cadres to 25 counties in the main grain and cotton-producing areas of Jinan and Jinzhong, helping local revolutionary masses to hold extensive Mao Zedong Thought study classes, further promoting the mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, and vigorously carrying out the "Agriculture Learns from Dazhai" activities. They assist these places in doing a good job of preparation for spring production. The Yanbei Prefecture has also dispatched a large number of cadres to counties, communes, and production brigades, providing strong assistance in holding Mao Zedong Thought study classes. The cadres who go to the countryside set an example, take the lead in fighting selfishness and criticizing revisionism, and solve practical problems in spring preparation work with the masses, implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions. The spring production situation in the entire region is excellent.

In spring agricultural production, various places have paid great attention to solving the problems of cadres and grassroots leadership cadres. In the spring production of 14 counties such as Xiyang, Hejin, Mengxian, Qixian, and Yicheng in Jinzhong and Jinan Prefectures, the correct treatment of cadres has been taken as a key issue. Currently, the leadership cadres of most grassroots units in these 14 counties have been replenished and strengthened. Many grassroots cadres, after studying in Mao Zedong Thought study classes, have raised their class struggle and line struggle consciousness, determined to seize the revolution and promote production, and actively shouldered the dual burdens of revolution and production. They have played a leading role in spring production and have been praised by the masses.

    山西农村贫下中农和干部贯彻抓革命促生产方针
    用伟大的毛泽东思想统帅春耕
    许多基层干部经过斗私批修在春耕中发挥骨干带头作用
    据新华社太原七日电　在夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的凯歌声中，在去年农业生产全面大丰收的基础上，山西省农村广大贫下中农、革命群众和革命干部，坚决贯彻执行毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的伟大方针，掀起了春季生产高潮。当前，山西农村到处是一派热气腾腾的大忙景象。积肥送肥、耙耱保墒、麦田管理、春季农田基本建设、棉田备耕等项生产活动已经全面展开。
    山西省农村广大贫下中农、革命群众、革命干部，大力突出无产阶级政治，以毛泽东思想统帅春耕生产。入春以来，从省到不少专区和县市，都先后召开了关于春季生产的三级、四级干部会。各地根据毛主席关于“办学习班，是个好办法，很多问题可以在学习班得到解决”的最新指示，以“斗私，批修”为纲，大办毛泽东思想学习班。全省县、社、队办的毛泽东思想学习班已经有三万八千多个，参加学习的人数达到二百五十多万人。这些活动，使活学活用毛泽东思想的伟大群众运动进一步广泛深入地展开，使毛主席的一系列最新指示更加深入人心。目前，山西省农村的革命大批判正在深入开展，广大革命群众和革命干部进一步肃清中国赫鲁晓夫的反革命修正主义路线在农村的流毒。他们通过革命的大批判，阶级斗争和路线斗争觉悟迅速提高，有力地推动了春季农业生产。
    山西省各级革命委员会、支左委员会、省军区、人民武装部，抽调干部组成毛泽东思想宣传队，到农村和群众同吃、同住、同劳动、同学习、同斗私批修，广泛宣传毛泽东思想和党的方针政策。省级领导机关共抽出二千多名干部，到晋南、晋中等粮棉主要产区的二十五个县，帮助当地革命群众大办毛泽东思想学习班，更广泛地开展活学活用毛主席著作的群众运动，大抓“农业学大寨”活动，协助这些地方，搞好备耕工作。雁北专区也派出大批干部到一些县、公社、生产大队，大力协助办好毛泽东思想学习班。下乡的干部以身作则，带头斗私批修，和群众一起落实毛主席的最新指示，解决备耕工作中的实际问题，全区春耕生产形势大好。
    各地在春季农业生产中，都很注意解决干部和基层领导班子问题。晋中、晋南专区的昔阳、河津、盂县、祁县、翼城等十四个县在春耕生产中，把正确对待干部作为关键问题来抓。现在，这十四个县绝大部分的基层单位都分别充实、健全了领导班子。很多基层干部在毛泽东思想学习班学习以后，提高了阶级斗争和路线斗争觉悟，决心抓好革命，促好生产，积极挑起了革命和生产两副重担，在春耕中发挥骨干带头作用，受到群众的称赞。
