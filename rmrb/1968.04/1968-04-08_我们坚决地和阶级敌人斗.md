Title: We Resolutely Struggle Against Class Enemies

After the basic completion of the socialist transformation of ownership of the means of production in our country, Chairman Mao solemnly instructed us, "The remnants of the overthrown landlord and comprador class still exist, the bourgeoisie still exists, and the petty bourgeoisie has just begun to be transformed. Class struggle has not ended."

At that time, the Chinese Khrushchev emerged, openly opposing Chairman Mao. He shouted that "the domestic enemies have basically been eliminated, the landlord class has long been eliminated, the bourgeoisie has also been basically eliminated, and the counter-revolutionaries have also been basically eliminated." According to the Chinese Khrushchev, classes have been eliminated, class struggle no longer exists, and proletarian dictatorship is unnecessary. This is sheer nonsense.

In fact, in the more than ten years since liberation, have the class enemies changed their class nature even a bit? Has the sharp and complex class struggle ever stopped for a moment? The development history of our Xiaoguang Brigade is a thrilling history of class struggle. Ironclad facts have given the Chinese Khrushchev a resounding slap in the face.

More than ten years ago, we responded to Chairman Mao's great call to "organize and take the socialist road," and thirteen poor and lower-middle peasants started the first cooperative—Xiaoguang Agricultural Production Cooperative. At this critical moment, class enemies launched a fierce attack on us, mocking and opposing our cooperative. Our most beloved great leader Chairman Mao firmly supported us. He personally wrote comments in the book *The Socialist High Tide in China's Countryside* for "A Poor Cooperative Mocked by Others"—Xiaoguang Cooperative: "The cooperative led by Liu Yuru is similar to the Wang Guanzhang cooperative in Hebei Province. Both are poor and looked down upon, but through hard struggle, they finally overcame difficulties. There are many such examples in every province, which should be widely publicized to encourage everyone."

With Chairman Mao backing us poor and lower-middle peasants, we bravely struggled against class enemies and against the capitalist road, repelling the class enemies' crazy challenges time and time again, achieving one great victory after another.

For more than ten years, the poor and lower-middle peasants of our Xiaoguang Brigade have advanced along the socialist bright road pointed out by Chairman Mao, achieving victory after victory. In the process, class enemies have not forgotten to struggle against us, always trying every means to sabotage and disrupt. During the primary and advanced cooperatives, class enemies, in order to achieve their goal of sabotaging the cooperative, used vicious methods of bribery and intimidation against cadres and poor and lower-middle peasants. One landlord told Liu Yutian (then the party branch secretary), "Don't do that (referring to the cooperative), no country lasts more than a dozen years, what will you do if the country changes?" Another landlord did not allow the production team to pull soil in the field, saying it was his land, and that one day the poor peasants would have to fill it with their heads. Even after the establishment of the commune and up to the present, class enemies have not been honest, always dreaming of a change and seizing the opportunity for class revenge. They openly shout "divide the land to households, return the land to the family." Especially during the "Four Cleanups" movement and this Cultural Revolution of the proletariat, many facts of class enemy activities have been exposed, further revealing the class enemies' wolfish ambitions to change the sky. Over the past ten years, a handful of capitalist roaders within the party and untransformed landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists have colluded, openly and secretly, using every means to struggle against us, but they have been repelled time and time again by the poor and lower-middle peasants of Xiaoguang Brigade armed with Mao Zedong Thought.

These shocking facts fully prove that the "class struggle extinction" theory advocated by the Chinese Khrushchev is just a lie to deceive people.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "All revolutionary struggles in the world are for the purpose of seizing power and consolidating power. The counter-revolutionaries' desperate struggle against the revolutionary forces is also entirely for the purpose of maintaining their power."

The "class struggle extinction" theory advocated by the Chinese Khrushchev is precisely for his purpose of usurping the party and usurping power, serving as a smokescreen for the bourgeoisie's attempt to usurp the leadership of the proletariat. They want to cover up the class enemies' attacks on socialism, want us to disarm our thoughts in the face of the class enemies' rampant attacks, and unknowingly realize their dream of restoring capitalism, making us laboring people suffer again. Chinese Khrushchev, your move is so vicious!

We must always remember class struggle, always remember proletarian dictatorship, always remember to emphasize politics, always remember to hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, and carry out the revolutionary criticism deeply and persistently. We must resolutely criticize and expose the Chinese Khrushchev thoroughly, and criticize and expose his counter-revolutionary revisionist fallacy of "class struggle extinction" thoroughly. We will forever defend the proletarian mountain and prevent it from changing color.

    我们坚决地和阶级敌人斗
    辽宁省锦县晓光公社晓光大队党支部书记　刘玉如
    在我国生产资料所有制的社会主义改造基本完成以后，毛主席谆谆教导我们说：“被推翻的地主买办阶级的残余还是存在，资产阶级还是存在，小资产阶级刚刚在改造。阶级斗争并没有结束。”
    当时，中国赫鲁晓夫跳了出来，公然同毛主席大唱反调。他叫嚷什么“现在国内敌人已经基本上被消灭，地主阶级早已消灭了，资产阶级也基本上消灭了，反革命也算是基本上消灭了”。按中国赫鲁晓夫的说法，阶级消灭了，阶级斗争不再存在了，无产阶级专政没有必要了……。这纯粹是一派胡言。
    事实上，解放后十几年来，阶级敌人的阶级本性曾有一丝一毫的改变么？尖锐复杂的阶级斗争曾有一时一刻的停息么？我们晓光大队的发展史就是一部惊心动魄的阶级斗争史。铁的事实，给了中国赫鲁晓夫一个响亮耳光。
    十多年前，我们响应毛主席“组织起来”，走社会主义道路的伟大号召，十三户贫下中农办起了第一个合作社——晓光农业生产合作社。在这关头，阶级敌人向我们发动了猖狂的进攻，讥笑、反对我们办社。我们最最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席，坚决支持我们，他老人家在《中国农村的社会主义高潮》一书中给《一个被人讥笑的穷合作社》——晓光社，亲自写了批语：“刘玉如领导的这个合作社，同河北省的王国藩合作社相似，都是因为穷，被人看不起，经过刻苦奋斗，终于战胜了困难的。各省都有许多这样的例子，应当广为传播，鼓励大家。”
    有毛主席给我们贫下中农撑腰，我们勇敢地和阶级敌人斗，和资本主义道路斗，击溃了阶级敌人一次又一次的疯狂挑战，取得了一个又一个的伟大胜利。
    我们晓光大队贫下中农，十多年来，沿着毛主席所指引的社会主义光明大道高歌猛进，在取得节节胜利过程中，阶级敌人并没有忘记同我们斗，总是千方百计地从事破坏和捣乱。在初级社、高级社时期，阶级敌人为了达到其破坏合作化的目的，对干部、贫下中农施用了拉拢、恫吓的恶毒手段。有个地主对刘玉田
  （当时支部书记）说：“你别那样干（指办社），哪个国家不都是十几年，将来换个国家你咋办！”有个地主不让生产队在地里拉土，说是他的地，有那一天要贫农拿脑袋填。公社化后直至目前，阶级敌人仍没有老实，总是梦想变天，伺机进行阶级报复。他们公开叫嚷“分田到户，土地还家”。特别是“四清”运动和这次无产阶级文化大革命，揭发了阶级敌人活动的许多事实，更加暴露了阶级敌人妄想变天的狼子野心。十几年来，党内一小撮走资派和没有改造好的地、富、反、坏、右分子勾结在一起，无论公开的、暗地的，千方百计地同我们较量，但都一次又一次被用毛泽东思想武装起来的晓光大队贫下中农打退了。
    这些触目惊心的事实，充分证明：中国赫鲁晓夫所鼓吹的“阶级斗争熄灭”论不过是骗人的鬼话。
    毛主席教导我们：“世界上一切革命斗争都是为着夺取政权，巩固政权。而反革命的拚死同革命势力斗争，也完全是为着维持他们的政权。”
    中国赫鲁晓夫所宣扬的“阶级斗争熄灭”论，正是为他篡党、篡政服务的，是资产阶级妄图篡夺无产阶级领导权的烟幕弹。他们就是要掩护着阶级敌人向社会主义进攻，就是要我们在阶级敌人的猖狂进攻下，解除思想武装，神不知鬼不觉地实现他们复辟资本主义美梦，让我们劳动人民再受二遍苦。中国赫鲁晓夫，你这一着好毒啊！
    我们一定要念念不忘阶级斗争，念念不忘无产阶级专政，念念不忘突出政治，念念不忘高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，把革命的大批判深入地持久地开展下去，坚决把中国赫鲁晓夫彻底批倒批臭，把他的“阶级斗争熄灭”的反革命修正主义谬论彻底批倒批臭。永保无产阶级的江山不变颜色。
