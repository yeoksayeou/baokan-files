	Travelers' Super-Completion of the First Quarter Fishing Task

	The broad revolutionary cadres and workers on the fishery front in Travelers, with the help of the People's Liberation Army's Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team, have been studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, seizing the revolution, and vigorously promoting production. The city has completed 47 percent over the first quarter fishing production plan, an increase of 16 percent over the same period last year. Marine aquaculture has also achieved greater results than the same period last year.

	Since the beginning of this year, the broad masses of workers on the fishery front in Travelers have turned the spring tide production front into a classroom for studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, and into a battlefield for carrying out revolutionary criticism and combating revisionism. Workers who go out to sea to catch fish have set up Mao Zedong Thought study classes on the sea. Following Chairman Mao's instruction to "never forget class struggle," they have used Mao Zedong Thought as the sharpest weapon in the study classes to expose and criticize the revisionist goods such as "production-based remuneration" and "production contracts to ships" promoted by Chinese Khrushchev and his agents on the fishery front. Through revolutionary criticism, they have turned their hatred for the class enemy into strength, with everyone striving to be a model in seizing the revolution and a pioneer in promoting production.

	This early spring, the weather was cold, the water temperature was low, and the waves were high, making the fishing production more difficult. The broad revolutionary masses and cadres, armed with the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, have displayed the spirit of "Yugong moving mountains," overcoming the difficulties of cold weather and strong winds, going out to sea early, and sending out more ships. They have pooled their wisdom and strength to achieve a bumper harvest. The motorized boat team of the marine commune in Longhai County has been fighting on the sea for more than 20 days and nights without returning to the port, creating the highest record of an average of 146,000 jin per boat pair in the first quarter.

    把春汛生产第一线变为活学活用毛主席著作大课堂
    旅大超额完成第一季度捕捞任务
    狠揭猛批中国赫鲁晓夫及其代理人在水产战线上推行的“见产提成”“包产到船”等修正主义黑货。通过革命大批判，他们把对阶级敌人的仇恨化为力量，人人争当抓革命的模范，促生产的闯将
    据新华社旅大二十三日电　旅大市水产战线的广大革命职工、革命干部，在人民解放军毛泽东思想宣传队的帮助下，活学活用毛主席著作，狠抓革命，猛促生产，全市超额百分之四十七完成了第一季度捕捞生产计划，比去年同期实际产量增加百分之十六；海水养殖也取得了比去年同期更大的成绩。
    今年以来，旅大水产战线上的广大职工把春汛生产第一线变为活学活用毛主席著作的大课堂，变成开展革命大批判和斗私批修战场。出海捕鱼的职工，在海上办起了毛泽东思想学习班，他们遵照毛主席“千万不要忘记阶级斗争”的教导，在毛泽东思想学习班里，结合水产战线上两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线斗争的大量事实，用毛泽东思想作为最锐利的武器，狠揭猛批中国赫鲁晓夫及其代理人在水产战线上推行的“见产提成”“包产到船”等修正主义黑货。通过革命的大批判，他们把对阶级敌人的仇恨化为力量，人人争当抓革命的模范，促生产的闯将。
    今年早春天气冷，水温低，风浪大，鱼苗洄游规律多变，给捕捞生产增加了不少困难。用战无不胜的毛泽东思想武装起来的广大革命群众、革命干部，发扬了“愚公移山”的革命精神，战胜天冷、风大的困难，出海早，出船多，群策群力，夺得了丰收。长海县海洋公社机帆船大队在海上奋战二十多个昼夜不回港，一季度创造了平均每对船单产十四万六千斤的最高纪录。
