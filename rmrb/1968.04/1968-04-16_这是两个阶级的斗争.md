This is a struggle between two classes.

Zhou Caihua and Lu Lianhe
Pinggu County, Shandongzhuang People's Commune

The Chinese Khrushchev shouts: "The masses have no confidence in the collectivization path," "If you don't allow individual farming, it won't work," "If you don't let him farm individually, he will do it secretly." This is a great slander against us poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary masses.

Is it the collectivization path or individual farming? This is a struggle between the socialist and capitalist roads, a class struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie. We poor and lower-middle peasants, based on our personal experience, have determined: collectivization is the path to prosperity, individual farming is the path to ruin.

Over the past decade, no matter the circumstances, we have always closely followed the great leader Chairman Mao, steadfastly advancing on the socialist road.

On the other hand, landlords, rich farmers, counter-revolutionaries, and bad elements who have not been reformed, and representatives of the bourgeoisie who have infiltrated the Party, are constantly sabotaging agricultural collectivization. Initially, they opposed the establishment of communes; later, they vigorously promoted the "three autonomies and one contract." However, the collective economy has been established, and the people's communes have been consolidated. In the end, we have won, and they have failed.

Individual farming is a living hell for us poor and lower-middle peasants. Retreating to individual farming means retreating to capitalism, pulling us poor and lower-middle peasants back to that old society where people devour each other, allowing landlords and rich farmers to ride our backs and lord over us again. Let me tell you, Chinese Khrushchev, we poor and lower-middle peasants have one hundred, one thousand, ten thousand times the confidence in the collectivization path! We are determined to walk the socialist road. You reactionary revisionist clique, trying to destroy the socialist collective economy, will never succeed.

    这是两个阶级的斗争
    平谷县山东庄公社　周彩华　路连合
    中国赫鲁晓夫叫嚷：对集体化道路“群众没信心”，“你不让单干，不行”，“你不让他单干，他暗单干。”这是对我们贫下中农和革命群众的极大诬蔑。
    是走集体化的道路，还是单干？这是社会主义和资本主义两条道路的斗争，是无产阶级和资产阶级的阶级斗争。我们贫下中农根据切身体会认定：集体化是阳关道，单干是鬼门关。
    十几年来，不论在任何情况下，我们总是紧紧跟着伟大领袖毛主席，在社会主义大道上坚定不移向前进。
    相反，没有改造好的地富反坏分子和混进党内的资产阶级代表人物，他们无时无刻不在破坏农业集体化。起初，他们反对办社；以后，又竭力推行“三自一包”。但是，集体经济建立起来了，人民公社巩固了，我们终究胜利了，他们终究失败了。
    单干对我们贫下中农是活地狱。退到单干，就是退到资本主义，就是把我们贫下中农拉回到那人吃人的旧社会，叫地主、富农重新骑在我们脖子上作威作福。告诉你，中国的赫鲁晓夫，我们贫下中农对集体化道路，一百个有信心，一千个有信心，一万个有信心！社会主义道路我们就是走定了。你们那一伙反革命修正主义分子，想要搞垮社会主义集体经济，是万万办不到的。
