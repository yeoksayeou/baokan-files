The creators of the poisonous film "Red River Waves" added a new segment in their fifth revision of the literary script in 1960. This segment claimed that the "leftist" line resulted in "reckless adventurism," which "sacrificed the revolution and buried comrades." This addition was made with malicious intent.

In 1959, during the Lushan Conference, the ambitious traitor Peng Dehuai, in order to cater to the needs of imperialism, modern revisionism, and the domestic rightists, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and landlords, threw out his anti-party manifesto, the so-called "opinion book." He appeared in the guise of opposing the "left" and launched a ferocious attack on Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee. Our great leader Chairman Mao timely exposed and smashed his anti-party plot, and removed him from office. Chairman Mao wisely pointed out: "The struggle at Lushan is a class struggle. In China, in our Party, this kind of struggle will continue, at least for another twenty years, possibly for half a century, until the class is completely eliminated and the struggle will cease." Not long after the Lushan Conference, the Chinese Khrushchev jumped out to rehabilitate Peng Dehuai, claiming that Peng's counter-revolutionary "opinion book" contained "many facts." He also maliciously slandered Chairman Mao's personally directed Lushan Conference as "overdone," causing "national sequelae." It was at this time that the creators of "Red River Waves" used the excuse of "reflecting the era and local characteristics" to loudly call for opposing the "left" and fabricated a scene in the literary script where the leftist opportunist Zhu, the special envoy, caused a "disastrous failure" through "reckless adventurism." The "reckless adventurism," "sacrificing the revolution," and "burying comrades" mentioned in the script, and the "reckless adventurism," "over-leftism," and so on mentioned in Peng Dehuai's anti-party "opinion book" attacking the general line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Communes, are all in the same tune.

During the creation of "Red River Waves," the remnants of the Gao Gang anti-party clique openly boasted: "We write literary works not only for the dead but also for the living." This reveals the true nature of "Red River Waves" opposing the "left." The "dead" he refers to is the great traitor Gao Gang, and the "living" refers to the ambitious traitor Peng Dehuai.

The so-called opposition to the "left" is actually directing the counter-revolutionary spearhead directly at the Party's Lushan Conference, hinting at the criticism of the rightist opportunist Peng Dehuai by the Party Central Committee led by Chairman Mao, and trying to rehabilitate Peng Dehuai and create public opinion for the Chinese Khrushchev to seize the Party, the government, the military, and restore capitalism.

In 1962, during the filming process, they feared that the ugly purpose of opposing the "left" would be too exposed, so they had to reluctantly cut out the "beloved" parts. But this is precisely a case of covering up only makes things worse, further proving that they have guilty consciences and are acting like thieves, further exposing their wolfish ambitions of counter-revolution under the pretext of opposing the "left."

We warn the Peng-Gao anti-party clique and their lackeys: the revolutionary fighters armed with Mao Zedong Thought have the reddest hearts and the brightest eyes. Anyone who dares to oppose Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee, we will resolutely overthrow them! We must firmly hold high the banner of revolutionary criticism, use Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon, and thoroughly criticize and expose the reactionary film "Red River Waves" and its dark backers, uprooting them completely!

    做贼心虚　欲盖弥彰
    解放军某部　孙文起　韩陆
    毒草影片《红河激浪》的炮制者，于一九六○年第五次修改文学剧本时，特意增加了一段新的内容：由于“左”倾路线“蛮干和冒险的结果，断送了革命，葬送了同志”。这个“增加”是别有用心的。
    联想到一九五九年党的庐山会议上，大野心家彭德怀为了适应帝国主义、现代修正主义和国内地、富、反、坏、右的需要，抛出了他的反党纲领，即所谓“意见书”。他以反“左”的面目出现，向毛主席和党中央发起了猖狂进攻。我们伟大领袖毛主席及时地识破并粉碎了他的反党阴谋，罢了他的官。毛主席英明地指出：“庐山出现的这一场斗争，是一场阶级斗争，……在中国，在我党，这一类斗争，看来还得斗下去，至少还要斗二十年，可能要斗半个世纪，总之要到阶级完全灭亡，斗争才会止息。”庐山会议开过不久，中国赫鲁晓夫就跳出来为彭德怀翻案，胡说什么彭德怀的反革命“意见书”中“一些具体事情，不少还是符合事实的”。他还大肆污蔑毛主席亲自主持的庐山会议搞“过火”了，“搞得全国后遗症”。就是在这个时候，《红河激浪》的炮制者就“以体现时代背景和地方特色”为理由，大叫大嚷要反“左”，并在文学剧本中编造了一段“左”倾机会主义分子朱特派员“冒险”“蛮干”造成“惨痛失败”的情节。剧本中所说的什么“蛮干”“冒险”，“断送革命”，“葬送同志”，和彭德怀反党“意见书”上攻击总路线、大跃进、人民公社所说的什么“蛮干”啦，“冒险”啦，过“左”啦等等，完全是一个腔调。
    高岗反党集团的余孽在炮制《红河激浪》过程中公然叫嚣：“我们写文艺作品，不仅是为了死人，而且也是为了活人”。这就一语道破了《红河激浪》反“左”的实质。他所说的死人就是大叛徒高岗，他所说的活人就是大野心家彭德怀。
    所谓反“左”，实际上就是把反革命的矛头直接指向党的庐山会议，影射以毛主席为首的党中央对右倾机会主义分子彭德怀的批判，替彭贼鸣冤叫屈，妄图为彭贼翻案，为中国赫鲁晓夫篡党、篡政、篡军、复辟资本主义制造舆论。
    一九六二年在影片摄制过程中，他们怕反“左”的丑恶目的暴露得太明显了，只好忍痛割“爱”。但这恰恰是欲盖弥彰，更加证明他们心中有鬼，做贼心虚，更加暴露了他们在反“左”的幌子下进行反党的狼子野心。
    我们正告彭、高反党集团及其娄罗们，用毛泽东思想武装起来的革命战士，心最红，眼最亮，谁敢反对毛主席，反对党中央，我们就坚决把他打倒！我们一定要高举革命的批判大旗，以毛泽东思想为武器，把反动影片《红河激浪》及其黑后台批倒批臭，连根铲除！
