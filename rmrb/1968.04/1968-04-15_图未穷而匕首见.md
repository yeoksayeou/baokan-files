The head of American imperialism, Johnson, has thrown out his so-called "partial bombing halt" scheme, but in just over ten days, the picture is not yet complete, but the dagger is already revealed. A large number of facts have further exposed Johnson's move as a thorough and complete deception.

What has the Johnson administration done in the past ten days?

Just as Johnson was shouting about achieving "peace" in Vietnam, the U.S. government took a series of measures to intensify the war of aggression against Vietnam.

It ordered the mobilization of 24,500 reserve personnel from the U.S. Army, Navy, and Air Force, preparing to increase the number of U.S. troops in Vietnam to nearly 550,000.

It actively mobilized troops, appointing Abrams, who is also a defeated general of the South Vietnamese people, to replace Westmoreland as the commander of U.S. troops in Vietnam, preparing for new military deployments in South Vietnam.

It ordered the U.S. arms industry to accelerate the production of large quantities of weapons to strengthen the equipment of U.S. troops and the puppet army in South Vietnam.

It convened a meeting of accomplices in the aggression against Vietnam to intensify the search for cannon fodder. Under U.S. orders, the Thai puppet regime announced that it would send an additional division of mercenary troops to South Vietnam.

It dispatched bandit planes to intensify the bombing of North Vietnam, concentrating on the area north of the demilitarized zone, with a level of wantonness that surpasses anything seen before.

All of these actions fully prove that Johnson's so-called "peace talks" are nothing more than a stalling tactic by the U.S. aggressors to buy time, a smokescreen to cover up their conspiracy to intensify the war.

Johnson is trying hard to act as if he is ready to hold "peace talks," but even on the issue of the location for "contact" between the two sides, he plays all sorts of tricks. Johnson has repeatedly declared in the past: "The United States is prepared to send its representatives to any place at any time to discuss ways to end this war," but now he has gone back on his word, opposing "contact" in Phnom Penh. As pointed out by Prince Norodom Sihanouk, the head of state of Cambodia: Such actions show the United States' "consistent contempt" for Cambodia, "The Americans have taken a bad attitude because they want to make a big propaganda out of the talks with North Vietnam." Just this one incident completely exposes the fact that the so-called "peace talks" proposed by the head of American imperialism are nothing but a big deception.

The reason the Johnson administration is pushing the "peace talks" deception is that it is in an unprecedentedly difficult situation both domestically and internationally. The war of aggression in Vietnam is in shambles, the dollar crisis is insoluble, the black struggle is raging, internal strife within the ruling class is fierce, and its international position is extremely isolated. With the U.S. elections approaching, Johnson, in collusion with and with the active help of the Soviet revisionist traitor clique, is playing this trick in an attempt to get through the crisis.

Our great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "The principle of the reactionary forces towards the people's democratic forces is to eliminate them if they can, and to prepare to eliminate them in the future if they cannot do so at present." American imperialism will never give up its ambition to invade Vietnam. Only by thoroughly defeating the U.S. aggressors on the battlefield and driving the American bandits out of Vietnamese territory, can the Vietnamese people achieve their sacred goals of national liberation and national reunification. At present, the heroic Vietnamese people are fighting tenaciously with a spirit of decisive battle and decisive victory, advancing from victory to victory. They will surely achieve the final victory in the war of resistance against U.S. aggression and for national salvation.

    图未穷而匕首见
    本报评论员
    美帝国主义头子约翰逊抛出所谓“部分停炸”的骗和方案，到现在不过十多天，图未穷而匕首已见。大量的事实进一步暴露了约翰逊的这一招是一个彻头彻尾的大骗局。
    最近十多天来，约翰逊政府干了些什么呢？
    就在约翰逊大叫大嚷要在越南“实现和平”的时候，美国政府采取一系列措施，加紧强化侵越战争。
    它下令征召美国陆、海、空军预备役人员两万四千五百名，准备把侵越美军增加到近五十五万人。
    它积极调兵遣将，任命同样是南越人民手下败将的艾布拉姆斯接替威斯特摩兰担任侵越美军司令，准备在南越战场进行新的军事部署。
    它让美国的军火工业加速制造大批武器，以加强侵越美军和南越伪军的装备。
    它召集侵越帮凶开会，加紧搜罗炮灰。在美国的指令下，泰国傀儡集团宣布将增派一师仆从军到南越去。
    它派遣强盗飞机变本加厉地对越南北方，集中在军事分界线北部，进行狂轰滥炸，其猖狂的程度比起过去有过之无不及。
    所有这些，充分证明约翰逊的所谓“和谈”，不过是美国侵略者为了取得喘息时间的缓兵计，是为了掩盖强化战争阴谋的烟幕弹。
    约翰逊竭力装出他是要举行“和谈”的样子，然而即使在双方“接触”的地点的问题上，也玩弄一套又一套的鬼花招。约翰逊过去一再宣称：“美国准备在任何时候派出自己的代表到任何场合去讨论结束这场战争的办法”，现在却又出尔反尔，反对在金边进行“接触”。正如柬埔寨国家元首西哈努克亲王所指出的：这种行径表现了美国对柬埔寨的“一贯藐视”，“美国人采取恶劣的态度，是因为他们想对同北越的会谈进行大事宣传”。仅仅这样一件事情，就完全拆穿了美帝国主义头子提出的所谓“和谈”，不过是一个大骗局。
    约翰逊政府之所以要大搞“和谈”骗局，就是因为它处于空前未有的内外交困的境地。侵越战争一败涂地，美元危机无法解脱，黑人斗争如火如荼，统治集团内讧激烈，国际处境十分孤立。而美国大选日益临近，约翰逊为了欺骗美国人民和世界人民，就在苏修叛徒集团的密切配合和大力帮助下玩弄这一招，妄图度过难关。
    我们伟大的导师毛主席教导我们说：“反动势力对于人民的民主势力的原则，是能够消灭者一定消灭之，暂时不能消灭者准备将来消灭之。”美帝国主义是决不会放弃它侵略越南的野心的。只有在战场上彻底打败美国侵略者，把美国强盗一个不剩地赶出越南国土，越南人民才能实现民族解放和祖国统一的神圣目标。目前英雄的越南人民正以决战决胜的精神，顽强战斗，乘胜前进。他们一定能够取得抗美救国战争的最后胜利。
