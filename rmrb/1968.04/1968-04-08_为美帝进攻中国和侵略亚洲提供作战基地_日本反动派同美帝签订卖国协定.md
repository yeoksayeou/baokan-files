For the U.S. imperialists to attack China and invade Asia, the Japanese reactionaries have signed a sellout pact with the U.S.

	According to a report by Xinhua News Agency on the 6th, Tokyo: The pro-American, traitorous Sato government, in accordance with the dictates of U.S. imperialism, has turned the southern Japanese islands of the Bonin Islands into a joint U.S.-Japanese military base for attacking China and invading Asia. On the afternoon of the 5th, in Tokyo, it signed an agreement with the U.S. government, known as the "return of the Bonin Islands."

	This agreement was signed based on a secret deal reached between Japanese Prime Minister Sato and U.S. President Johnson during Sato's visit to the U.S. last year. The formal agreement signed this time by the Sato government and the U.S. government blatantly guarantees that the U.S. will continue to maintain its military facilities and troops on the Bonin Islands, including radar stations for guiding U.S. nuclear submarines and the U.S. "Coast Guard." At the same time, under the pretext of "returning" the administrative, legislative, and judicial powers of the Bonin Islands to Japan, it demands that Japan send troops to these islands and expand the scope of the "security treaty" and other military agreements signed between the U.S. and Japan to these islands. The pro-American, traitorous Sato government, at the expense of the interests of the Japanese people and the people of the Bonin Islands, agreed in this sellout agreement to waive Japan's right to compensation for damages caused by the U.S. during its occupation of these islands. The Sato government also agreed to allow the U.S. occupying forces to build a bronze Stars and Stripes monument on Iwo Jima in the Bonin Islands, which is a great insult to the Japanese people.

	Since the end of last year, the Japanese "Defense Agency" has repeatedly sent military survey teams to the Bonin Islands, including Chichi-jima, Iwo Jima, and Minami-tori-shima, to secretly negotiate with the U.S. side on the issue of Japanese troops stationed in the Bonin Islands and U.S.-Japan "joint defense."

	According to a January issue of the Japanese magazine "Free World," the Japanese "Defense Agency" and the U.S. plan to first turn the Bonin Islands into a joint U.S.-Japanese anti-submarine base to attack China. The current plan is: The Japanese Navy will station four to six submarines in Chichi-jima and share the Futami Port with the U.S. military "Coast Guard" to strengthen the joint U.S.-Japanese anti-submarine forces in the frontline of the southern seas. At the same time, twelve P2V anti-submarine reconnaissance aircraft will be dispatched to Iwo Jima, and the U.S. and Japan will share the use of the airport on this island.

### 为美帝进攻中国和侵略亚洲提供作战基地  日本反动派同美帝签订卖国协定

    为美帝进攻中国和侵略亚洲提供作战基地
    日本反动派同美帝签订卖国协定
    据新华社六日讯　东京消息：亲美卖国的佐藤政府，根据美帝意旨，为了把日本南端的小笠原群岛变成进攻中国和侵略亚洲的美日联合作战基地，五日下午，在东京同美国政府签订了一个所谓“归还小笠原”的协定。
    这个协定是根据去年日本首相佐藤访美时，同美国总统约翰逊达成的密约签订的。这次佐藤政府和美国正式签订的协定，露骨地保证美国继续保留在小笠原群岛上的军事设施和军队，其中包括为美国核潜艇等舰只导航的雷达站和美国的“沿岸警备队”。同时，以把小笠原群岛的“行政立法及司法权”“归还”给日本作幌子，要日本向这个群岛出兵，并把美日之间签订的“安全保障”条约及其它军事协定的适用范围，扩大到这些岛屿。亲美卖国的佐藤政府还不惜牺牲日本民族和小笠原群岛人民的利益，在这个卖国的协定中，同意放弃日本对美国在它占领这些岛屿期间所造成的损害的赔偿要求。佐藤政府还表示同意，美国占领军在小笠原的硫黄岛上修建一个铜铸的星条旗的纪念碑。这是对日本民族的绝大污辱。
    日本“防卫厅”自去年底以来多次向小笠原的父岛、硫黄岛、南鸟岛等派出军事考察团，与美国方面就日本军队进驻小笠原以后日美“联合防卫”的问题，进行密商。
    据今年一月出版的日本杂志《自由世界》透露，日本“防卫厅”和美国准备首先把小笠原群岛变成攻击中国的日美联合反潜基地，目前的计划是：日本海军向父岛派驻潜艇四至六艘，同美军
  “沿岸警备队”共用父岛的二见港，以便加强在南方海域第一线的日美联合作战的反潜力量。同时，向硫黄岛派遣P2V反潜侦察机十二架，日美共用这个岛上的机场。
