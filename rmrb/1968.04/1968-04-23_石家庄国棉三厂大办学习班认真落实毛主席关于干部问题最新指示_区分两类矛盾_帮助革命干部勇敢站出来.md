The People's Liberation Army stationed at Shijiazhuang Cotton Mill No. 3 has organized extensive Mao Zedong Thought study classes, earnestly implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions on cadre issues. They have guided revolutionary masses to correctly evaluate cadres, warmly help cadres, and boldly use cadres.

	The revolutionary masses of this mill, with the help of the stationed PLA, have already liberated a batch of cadres. However, none of the mill-level leaders and main leaders of the workshops have been liberated. Facing this situation, the stationed PLA support-left personnel conducted in-depth investigations and research in the workshops, teams, dormitories, and canteens. They discovered that the main reason was that some masses did not strictly distinguish between two different types of contradictions. When evaluating cadres, they often focused on individual incidents and short-term behavior, overlooked the overall history and work of the cadres, and emphasized minor issues over major revolutionary principles. This affected the implementation of Chairman Mao's cadre policy.

	To address these issues, the support-left personnel organized the masses to hold various types of Mao Zedong Thought study classes, seriously studying Chairman Mao's brilliant work "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People" and his teachings on cadre issues. Through the study, everyone unanimously recognized that the majority of the mill's cadres are good or relatively good. Those who previously emphasized the uniqueness of the mill's situation also changed their views. They said that it was not that the mill's cadres were unique, but that they had not correctly and comprehensively evaluated the cadres according to Chairman Mao's cadre policy and from the standpoint of the proletarian party. Li Baorui, a former member of the mill's Party Committee and the secretary of the Party branch of the preparation workshop, comes from a poor peasant family, has deep proletarian feelings for Chairman Mao, and is a good cadre. In the early stages of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, he carried out the bourgeois reactionary line, but later, he quickly recognized his mistakes and made a deep self-criticism. However, some masses still did not forgive him. In the study class, the support-left personnel organized everyone to repeatedly study Chairman Mao's latest instructions such as "Cadre issues should start from education, expanding the scope of education" and "Making mistakes is inevitable, as long as one sincerely corrects them, it will be fine." Based on the improved understanding, Li Baorui and the masses together denounced the crimes of the bourgeois reactionary line and recalled the hardships of the old society. When Li Baorui recounted his miserable life as a child pig herder and deeply criticized his mistakes during the movement, everyone was deeply moved and immediately expressed their firm support for him to step forward and revolutionize. Wei Fucong, the former secretary of the mill's Party Committee, is a revolutionary cadre. In the early stages of the Cultural Revolution, he once took the wrong side. Regarding his issues, revolutionary masses had heated debates. To address this situation, the support-left personnel organized discussions in the study class around Wei Fucong's issues, guiding everyone to study Chairman Mao's teachings on "One must be good at identifying cadres. Not only should one look at a cadre's individual incidents, but also at the cadre's entire history and work. This is the main method of identifying cadres," and informed the masses of Wei Fucong's past work performance. This made everyone realize that Wei Fucong had a good record over the past thirty years of revolution. Thus, everyone firmly supported him to step forward and revolutionize.

	In the process of liberating cadres, the stationed PLA discovered another thought among some revolutionary workers. Some people thought: "Since we do not overthrow them, whether they step forward or not is their problem, not ours." To address these active thoughts, the stationed PLA organized everyone to repeatedly study Chairman Mao's relevant teachings, enhancing the revolutionary sense of responsibility among the broad revolutionary masses, and quickly launching a mass movement across the mill to help cadres step forward and revolutionize. The broad revolutionary masses also held various study classes, actively learning and applying Chairman Mao's latest instructions with the cadres, fighting against selfishness and criticizing revisionism, helping cadres firmly establish a sense of loyalty, and bravely stepping forward to revolutionize.

	With the help of the stationed PLA, the majority of cadres across the mill have successively stepped forward, creating good conditions for implementing the revolutionary three-in-one combination. However, when studying the objects of the three-in-one combination, some masses dared not boldly put revolutionary cadres in important positions. Some leaders of individual revolutionary mass organizations had selfish thoughts, fearing that if cadres were combined, they themselves would not be the main leaders. To address these active thoughts, the stationed PLA specially organized a Mao Zedong Thought study class, organizing everyone to repeatedly study Chairman Mao's teachings such as "Everything should be based on the interests of the people, not on the interests of individuals or small groups," guiding everyone to fiercely fight against selfishness and spark a revolution in their souls. The support-left personnel also discussed with everyone the benefits of boldly using revolutionary cadres in important positions. When electing the revolutionary three-in-one combination leadership, revolutionary masses consciously put forward revolutionary cadres and let them take on important leadership roles. Two-thirds of the middle-level and above cadres across the mill participated in various levels of the revolutionary three-in-one combination leadership. Of the nine mill-level and workshop first-in-command positions, eight were taken by cadres, with seven being elected as the first-in-command of various levels of revolutionary committees, shouldering the responsibilities of revolution and production. The broad masses, based on revolutionary interests, actively supported and assisted them in doing a good job. Cadres and masses united in thought and effort, making the entire mill's revolution and production present a vibrant and new scene.

    石家庄国棉三厂大办学习班认真落实毛主席关于干部问题最新指示
    区分两类矛盾　帮助革命干部勇敢站出来
    全厂三分之二的中层以上干部参加了各级革命三结合领导班子。九名厂级和车间的第一把手，有八名担任了领导工作，挑起革命和生产的重担
    据新华社石家庄电  在石家庄国棉三厂支左的人民解放军，大办毛泽东思想学习班，认真落实毛主席关于干部问题的最新指示，引导革命群众正确地衡量干部，热情地帮助干部，放手地使用干部。
    这个厂的广大革命职工在驻厂解放军的帮助下，早已解放了一批干部。但是厂级领导干部和车间的主要领导干部，一个没有解放。面对这种状况，驻厂解放军支左人员就深入车间、班组、宿舍、食堂，进行了深入细致的调查研究，发现主要的原因是，有些群众没有严格区分两类不同性质的矛盾，在考察干部时，往往看一时一事多，看全部历史和全部工作少；看小节多，看革命大节少，以致影响了毛主席的干部政策的贯彻落实。
    针对这些问题，支左人员组织群众开办各种类型的毛泽东思想学习班，认真地学习毛主席《关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题》这一光辉著作和毛主席关于干部问题的教导。通过学习，大家一致认识到，厂里的干部绝大多数是好的和比较好的。过去强调厂里情况特殊的群众也改变了自己的看法。他们说，不是我们厂干部情况特殊，而是我们没有按照毛主席的干部政策和站在无产阶级党性立场上正确地、全面地衡量干部。原厂党委委员、准备车间党支部书记李宝瑞，出身贫农，苦大仇深，对毛主席有深厚的无产阶级感情，是个好干部。无产阶级文化大革命初期，他执行了资产阶级反动路线，后来，对自己的错误认识比较快，检查深刻。但是，部分群众仍不谅解他。在学习班里，支左人员组织大家反复学习了毛主席关于“干部问题，要从教育着手，扩大教育面。”“犯错误是难免的，只要认真改了，就好了”等最新指示。在提高认识的基础上，李宝瑞和群众一起控诉资产阶级反动路线的罪行，共忆旧社会的苦难。当李宝瑞诉说了他从小当放猪娃，受尽折磨的悲惨生活，沉痛地检查了自己在运动中所犯的错误以后，大家很受感动，当场表示坚决支持他站出来革命。原厂党委书记隗付聪是革命领导干部。他在文化大革命初期，一度站错了队。对于他的问题，革命群众之间争论不休。针对这种情况，支左人员在学习班里围绕隗付聪的问题展开讨论，引导大家学习毛主席“必须善于识别干部。不但要看干部的一时一事，而且要看干部的全部历史和全部工作，这是识别干部的主要方法”的教导，并把隗付聪过去的工作表现都告诉群众，这使大家认识到隗付聪参加革命三十年来，大节是好的。这样，大家都坚决支持他站出来革命。
    在解放干部的工作中，驻厂解放军又发现部分革命职工产生另一种思想。有些人认为：既然我们不打倒他们，站不站出来，是他们的问题，与我们没有关系。针对这些活思想，驻厂解放军又组织大家反复学习毛主席有关的教导，提高了广大革命职工的革命责任感，并很快地在全厂掀起了一个帮助干部站出来革命的群众运动。广大革命职工还举办各种学习班，和干部一起活学活用毛主席最新指示，一起斗私批修，帮助干部大树一个“忠”字，勇敢地站出来革命。
    在驻厂解放军的帮助下，全厂绝大部分干部相继站了出来，为实现革命三结合创造了良好的条件。但是，在研究三结合的对象时，有些群众不敢大胆地把革命干部放到重要岗位上。个别革命群众组织的负责人，“私”字作怪，怕结合了干部，自己当不了主要领导。针对这些活思想，驻厂解放军专门办了一期毛泽东思想学习班，组织大家反复学习了毛主席“一切从人民的利益出发，而不是从个人或小集团的利益出发”等教导，引导大家狠斗“私”字，在灵魂深处爆发革命。支左人员还和大家一起大摆把革命干部放到重要岗位上、大胆使用的好处。在选举革命三结合的领导班子时，革命群众都自觉地把革命干部推选出来，并让他们分别担任重要领导工作。全厂三分之二的中层以上干部参加了各级革命三结合的领导班子。九名厂级和车间的第一把手，有八名担任了领导工作，其中七名被推选为各级革委会的第一把手，挑起了革命和生产重担。广大职工从革命利益出发，积极支持和协助他们做好工作。干部和群众心往一处想，劲往一处使，使全厂革命、生产呈现一派蓬蓬勃勃的崭新景象。
