The propaganda team of the 601st Unit of the People's Liberation Army stationed in the Jiangxi New China Printing Plant has helped the plant's revolutionary committee establish systems for studying Chairman Mao's works, carrying out criticism and self-criticism, and maintaining close ties with the masses, thus effectively promoting the revolutionization of the revolutionary committee.

According to Xinhua News Agency, Nanchang, April 6—The propaganda team of the 601st Unit of the People's Liberation Army stationed in the Jiangxi New China Printing Plant has held high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, enthusiastically supported the newly born revolutionary committee, and helped the revolutionary committee firmly follow the path of emphasizing proletarian politics, building a revolutionary and people-oriented leadership team.

The propaganda team of the 601st Unit stationed in the plant, following the great teacher Chairman Mao's instruction that "the People's Liberation Army should support the broad masses of the left," has formed a close combat friendship with the proletarian revolutionary faction and the revolutionary masses of the plant in the process of helping the plant's proletarian revolutionary faction carry out revolutionary criticism, achieve revolutionary unity, and implement the three-in-one combination. After the plant's revolutionary committee was established, the propaganda team poured their deep proletarian feelings of loyalty to Chairman Mao into the building of the revolutionary committee. As soon as the revolutionary committee was established, the team members enthusiastically shared their experiences of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, insisting on the Four Firsts, and promoting the Three-Eight Style with the new leadership team to achieve ideological revolutionization. They first helped the revolutionary committee establish an unshakable system for studying Chairman Mao's works, regarding unlimited loyalty to the great leader Chairman Mao, unlimited loyalty to the great Mao Zedong Thought, and unlimited loyalty to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line as the highest requirement for each member. Through "daily reading," "study days," and regular struggle sessions to criticize and rectify private and revisionist thoughts, they inspired the committee members to be loyal to the great leader Chairman Mao with a single "loyal" heart, to grasp the use of the great Mao Zedong Thought with a single "use" effort, to break with private interests and establish public interests, to hold power well with Mao Zedong Thought, and to use power well. At the same time, the team members also helped the revolutionary committee hold plant-wide political work meetings to timely check and summarize the situation of studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought. With the help of the propaganda team, the revolutionary committee members took the lead in identifying gaps, formulating measures, and striving to be models in studying, executing, propagating, and defending Chairman Mao's latest instructions, pushing the plant-wide movement of studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought to a new high.

To build the revolutionary committee into a vigorous and strong fighting fortress, the team members brought the People's Liberation Army's fine tradition of promoting the Three-Eight Style and practicing the Three Great Democracies into the revolutionary committee, helping the revolutionary committee establish a system for carrying out criticism and self-criticism. Within the revolutionary committee, they insisted on holding a democratic life meeting every week and a plant-wide workers' democratic meeting every month, using Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon, and following the formula of "unity—criticism and self-criticism—unity" to carry out criticism and self-criticism, helping the revolutionary committee members improve their work and style, and accelerate ideological revolutionization. Once, some members of the revolutionary committee had strong opinions about the committee chairman's habit of consulting only a few members on matters. After discovering this, the Mao Zedong Thought propaganda team organized a study of Chairman Mao's "Methods of Work of Party Committees" and his teachings on criticism and self-criticism during a democratic life meeting, guiding everyone to put the problem on the table, engage in more self-criticism, be strict with oneself, and lenient with others, seek common ground while reserving differences. During the meeting, everyone voluntarily engaged in self-criticism, which greatly strengthened the collective leadership and democratic atmosphere within the revolutionary committee, and the committee members became more united. The team members also, following Chairman Mao's instruction to "carry out heart-to-heart talks, which is a good method," helped the revolutionary committee members establish a system for carrying out heart-to-heart talks. Old and new cadres, in the form of "one helps one, one pairs red," often engage in individual heart-to-heart talks, learning from and helping each other, and complementing each other's strengths and weaknesses. During the monthly plant-wide workers' meeting, the revolutionary committee fully practiced democracy, widely listened to the masses' criticisms, humbly accepted the masses' supervision, and received the masses' praise.

The great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "The most fundamental aspect of reforming state organs is to connect with the masses." The propaganda team of Mao Zedong Thought stationed in the plant regarded helping the revolutionary committee members establish a system for maintaining close ties with the masses, making the revolutionary committee members both "officials" and "common people," and rooting themselves among the masses to maintain the character of the working people as an important task. The team's cadres often shared their practices of implementing the "five together" method with soldiers in their units with the revolutionary committee members, explaining that this approach could prevent cadres from becoming detached from the masses and maintain close ties with the masses. At the suggestion of the propaganda team, the revolutionary committee assigned each member to a specific workshop to work shifts with the workers and visit workers' homes after work to do in-depth and detailed ideological work.

    革委会要坚定地走突出政治的道路
    六○一一部队驻江西新华印刷厂的毛泽东思想宣传队，帮助厂革委会建立了学习毛主席著作、开展批评自我批评和密切联系群众等制度，有力地促进了革委会的革命化
    据新华社南昌六日电　人民解放军六○一一部队驻江西新华印刷厂的毛泽东思想宣传队，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，热情支持新诞生的革命委员会，帮助革命委员会坚定不移地走突出无产阶级政治的道路，建设起一个革命化的联系群众的领导班子。
    六○一一部队驻厂毛泽东思想宣传队，遵照伟大导师毛主席“人民解放军应该支持左派广大群众”的教导，在帮助这个厂的无产阶级革命派开展革命大批判、实现革命大联合和革命三结合的过程中，同这个厂的无产阶级革命派和广大革命职工结成了亲密的战斗友谊。厂革命委员会成立后，毛泽东思想宣传队把无限忠于毛主席的深厚无产阶级感情，倾注在革命委员会的建设上。厂革命委员会一成立，宣传队的指战员就热情地向革委会传授部队活学活用毛主席著作，坚持四个第一，大兴三八作风的经验，帮助新的领导班子实现思想革命化。他们首先帮助革命委员会建立了雷打不动的学习毛主席著作的制度，把无限忠于伟大领袖毛主席，无限忠于伟大的毛泽东思想，无限忠于毛主席的无产阶级革命路线作为对每个成员的最高要求。通过“天天读”、“学习日”、定期召开斗私批修讲用会等，启发委员们对伟大领袖毛主席心怀一个“忠”字，对伟大的毛泽东思想狠抓一个“用”字，破私立公，用毛泽东思想掌好权，用好权。同时，宣传队的同志又帮助革委会召开全厂政治工作会议，及时检查和总结活学活用毛泽东思想的情况。在宣传队的帮助下，革委会成员带头找差距、订措施，争当学习、执行、宣传、捍卫毛主席最新指示的模范，把全厂活学活用毛泽东思想的群众运动推向了新高潮。
    为了把革命委员会建设成为朝气蓬勃的坚强的战斗堡垒，宣传队的同志把人民解放军大兴三八作风、发扬三大民主的优良传统，带进了革命委员会，帮助革命委员会建立了开展批评和自我批评的制度。在革委会内部坚持每周有一次民主生活会，每月召开一次全厂性的职工民主大会，以毛泽东思想为武器，按照
  “团结——批评和自我批评——团结”的公式，开展批评和自我批评，帮助革委会成员改进工作和作风，加速实现思想革命化。有一次，革委会的一些成员对革委会主任遇事只和少数成员商量很有意见，毛泽东思想宣传队发现后，就在民主生活会上组织大家学习毛主席的《党委会的工作方法》和关于批评与自我批评的教导，引导大家把问题摆到桌面上，多作自我批评，严于责己，宽于责人，求大同，存小异。会上大家都主动作了自我批评，使革委会内部的集体领导和民主空气有了很大加强，委员之间也更加团结了。宣传队的同志还根据毛主席“开展谈心活动，这个方法很好”的教导，帮助革委会成员建立了开展谈心活动的制度。新老干部之间，以“一帮一、一对红”的形式，经常进行个别谈心，互相学习，互相帮助，取长补短。在每月一次的全厂职工大会上，革委会充分发扬民主，广泛听取群众的批评意见，虚心接受群众的监督，得到了群众的好评。
    伟大领袖毛主席教导我们：“国家机关的改革，最根本的一条，就是联系群众。”驻厂毛泽东思想宣传队把帮助革委会成员建立密切联系群众的制度，使革委会成员“既当‘官’，又当老百姓”，扎根群众之中，保持劳动人民的本色，作为一项重要任务。宣传队的干部经常把自己在连队和战士实行五同的作法传授给革命委员会成员，说明这样作能使干部不脱离群众，保持和群众的密切联系。在宣传队的建议下，革命委员会把每个成员定点到各个车间，和工人一道顶班劳动，下班后到工人家里访问，作深入细致的思想工作。
