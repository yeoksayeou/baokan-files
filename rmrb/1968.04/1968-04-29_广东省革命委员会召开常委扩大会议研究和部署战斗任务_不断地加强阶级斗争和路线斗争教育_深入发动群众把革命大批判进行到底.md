Guangdong Provincial Revolutionary Committee recently held an enlarged meeting of the Standing Committee to study and deploy combat tasks. The meeting seriously studied Chairman Mao's instructions: "The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is, in essence, a great political revolution waged by the proletariat against the bourgeoisie and all other exploiting classes in the condition of socialism, a continuation of the long-term struggle between the Communist Party of China led by the broad revolutionary masses and the Kuomintang reactionaries, and a continuation of the class struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie." Following Chairman Mao's instructions, the meeting analyzed and studied the class struggle situation in the entire province, deployed combat tasks, and decided to arm the entire province's people with Chairman Mao's latest instructions, closely follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, and focus on the struggle between the two classes, two roads, and two lines. They will lead the people of the entire province to launch a sustained and fierce attack on all class enemies, expose and criticize all counter-revolutionaries, traitors, spies, and unrepentant capitalist-roaders, and thoroughly carry out this political revolution to achieve a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in the entire province.

Never Forget Class Struggle

The attendees first analyzed the class struggle situation in Guangdong with Chairman Mao's latest instructions as the guideline. They unanimously agreed that the class struggle in Guangdong has always been sharp and complex. Imperialism has long extended its claws, cultivating its lackeys; American and Chiang Kai-shek spies, as well as British, Japanese, and Soviet revisionist spies, have used every means to sabotage and disrupt us; remnants of the Kuomintang, traitors, and spies have disguised themselves and infiltrated; during the unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, a handful of unrepentant capitalist-roaders within the party have been exposed by the broad revolutionary masses, but they have not been thoroughly criticized and repudiated. The poison of their counter-revolutionary revisionism has not been completely eradicated. At every opportunity, they stir up trouble and launch a ferocious counterattack against the revolutionary people. Everyone agreed that these class enemies of various kinds have a common counter-revolutionary goal: to restore capitalism in China. Some revolutionary leaders recalled and examined their past mistakes of not focusing on class struggle, lacking vigilance against cunning class enemies, and received great education. Everyone deeply realized: The history of our party is a history of class struggle. The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution personally initiated and led by the great leader Chairman Mao is a great struggle and decisive battle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie, a continuation of our long-term struggle against the Kuomintang reactionaries. As long as classes exist, the class struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie will not stop. Therefore, we must always remember the great leader Chairman Mao's instruction, "Never forget class struggle," and use the perspective of class and class struggle to analyze all people and all social phenomena. Only in this way can we understand the situation, distinguish between enemies and friends, closely follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, firmly grasp the direction of the struggle, and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to the end.

Accurately, Fiercely, and Steadily Strike Class Enemies

The attendees believed that to launch a sustained and fierce attack on class enemies, we must continuously strengthen class struggle and line struggle education within our revolutionary ranks, overcome rightist tendencies, and raise the awareness of class struggle and line struggle among the revolutionary masses and the broad revolutionary masses.

Everyone pointed out in the discussion that the closer the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is to comprehensive victory, the more fiercely the class enemies will struggle desperately. They are always probing for opportunities, changing their counter-revolutionary strategies with the changing situation, sometimes attacking us from the right, sometimes from the extreme "left," and sometimes using both right and extreme "left" counter-revolutionary tactics simultaneously. Currently, class enemies are mainly attacking us from the right, spreading a rightist revisionist wind. They use all kinds of poisonous and cunning methods: some use counter-revolutionary economism to lure unsteady people in our ranks; some create incidents to provoke struggles between revolutionary mass organizations; some sneak into the newly born revolutionary power, attempting to split and disintegrate the revolutionary ranks from within; some vigorously stir up conflicts between the military and the people, between revolutionary mass organizations, and among members of the revolutionary committees; when they can no longer mix in, they fabricate rumors to make a living. No matter how the class enemies change their counter-revolutionary tactics, their targets are always aimed at the proletarian headquarters, the People's Liberation Army, and the newly born revolutionary committees, attempting to achieve their evil goal of restoring capitalism. If we relax our vigilance against class enemies and our fighting spirit because of victory, we will become numb and unable to distinguish between enemies and friends in the face of serious class struggle, even mistaking enemies for friends, blurring the class lines, and giving class enemies an open door to carry out sabotage activities.

"We revolutionary party members must understand their tricks, study their strategies to defeat them." We must use the political telescope and microscope of Mao Zedong Thought to identify class enemies, no matter how cleverly they disguise themselves or how they change their tactics, we will expose them and completely reveal their counter-revolutionary ugly faces in broad daylight.

The attendees believed that currently, class enemies are using every means to sow discord, create splits, sabotage the great alliance and the three-in-one combination of the revolution, sabotage the unity of the revolutionary ranks, and undermine the fighting strength of the revolutionary ranks, diverting the direction of the struggle. We must keep our eyes open, expose the tricks of class enemies, and resolutely oppose rightist opportunism, rightist splitism, and rightist capitulationism. All revolutionary comrades must unite more closely on the basis of Mao Zedong Thought, firmly grasp the direction of the struggle, and direct the struggle's spearhead at the class enemies. "Organize tens of millions of people, mobilize a surging revolutionary army," accurately, fiercely, and steadily strike the various sabotage activities of class enemies. Under any circumstances, we must never direct the spearhead at any part of the revolutionary masses with different views, and we must never do things that hurt friends and please enemies.

Deeply and Persistently Carry Out the Revolutionary Criticism

The meeting thoroughly discussed the issue of deeply and persistently carrying out the revolutionary criticism. The attendees recognized that revolutionary criticism is a powerful weapon for launching a sustained and fierce attack on class enemies. Only by carrying the revolutionary criticism to the end can we thoroughly criticize and repudiate a handful of stubborn capitalist-roaders and traitors, spies, and clean up the poison of various reactionary thoughts they spread. Only by carrying the revolutionary criticism to the end can we better establish Mao Zedong Thought and raise the proletarian awareness of the broad revolutionary people.

Many comrades recalled that in the past two years, whenever the broad revolutionary masses ignited the fiery flames of revolutionary criticism, class enemies, like bats fearing sunlight, used every means to evade, obstruct, and sabotage the revolutionary criticism. Everyone further realized: Revolutionary criticism is a serious class struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie. "Whatever the enemy opposes, we support." The more class enemies fear revolutionary criticism, the more we must raise the banner of revolutionary criticism higher, without stopping for a moment, to expose, criticize, and struggle against class enemies, and carry out the revolutionary criticism vigorously and persistently. Giving up revolutionary criticism is to abandon the greatest political principle and abandon the revolutionary direction.

The attendees also summarized and exchanged experiences in carrying out revolutionary criticism, mainly using Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon and combining revolutionary criticism with the current class struggle reality and the class struggle reality of various units, and combining it with the struggle, criticism, and reform of various units. Through revolutionary criticism, effectively arouse the deep class feelings of the broad revolutionary masses' limitless love for the great leader Chairman Mao and limitless loyalty to Mao Zedong Thought, arouse deep hatred for Khrushchev of China, expose all unrepentant capitalist-roaders, traitors, spies, and all hidden counter-revolutionaries within the party, eradicate the roots of counter-revolutionary revisionism, and clean up the poison of the counter-revolutionary revisionist line. In the revolutionary criticism, we must also closely combine the criticism of revisionism with the struggle against selfishness, learn from the poor and lower-middle peasants of Huangshandong Brigade, and achieve learning one of Chairman Mao's quotations, criticizing one of Khrushchev of China's fallacies, and examining once the "self" in one's mind, and clean up the poison of revisionism. On the battlefield of revolutionary criticism, we must show our great courage in fighting the enemy, temper our great loyalty to Chairman Mao, enhance our immunity to revisionism, and in the great winds and waves of class struggle, break with selfishness and establish public spirit, and continuously promote the revolutionization of people's thoughts.

The attendees unanimously believed that Chairman Mao's series of latest instructions are powerful ideological weapons for us to carry out class struggle. The comprehensive implementation of Chairman Mao's series of latest instructions is the comprehensive victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and the heaviest annihilating blow to all class enemies. Class enemies will definitely use various means to obstruct the implementation of Chairman Mao's latest instructions. Therefore, no matter what complex situations we encounter or what interference appears in society, we must hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, firmly and unshakably use all our energy to run Mao Zedong Thought study classes well, focus on the implementation of Chairman Mao's latest instructions, and continuously push the great mass movement of studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought in the entire province to a new stage.

    广东省革命委员会召开常委扩大会议研究和部署战斗任务
    不断地加强阶级斗争和路线斗争教育  深入发动群众把革命大批判进行到底
    本报讯　最近，广东省革命委员会召开常委扩大会议，认真学习了毛主席的教导：“无产阶级文化大革命，实质上是在社会主义条件下，无产阶级反对资产阶级和一切剥削阶级的政治大革命，是中国共产党及其领导下的广大革命人民群众和国民党反动派长期斗争的继续，是无产阶级和资产阶级阶级斗争的继续。”遵照毛主席的教导，会议分析和研究了全省的阶级斗争形势，部署了战斗任务，决定要用毛主席的最新指示把全省人民武装起来，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，大抓狠抓两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的斗争，带领全省人民向一切阶级敌人发起持久的猛烈的进攻，把一切反革命分子、叛徒、特务和死不悔改的走资派，统统揪出来，批倒批臭，把这一场政治大革命进行到底，夺取全省无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利。
      千万不要忘记阶级斗争
    到会的同志首先以毛主席的最新指示为纲，分析了广东的阶级斗争形势。他们一致认为广东的阶级斗争历来就十分尖锐、复杂。帝国主义很早就把魔爪伸了进来，培养了它们的爪牙；美蒋特务和英、日、苏修特务，千方百计地对我们进行破坏和捣乱；国民党的残渣余孽、叛徒、特务，乔装打扮，潜伏下来了；在史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命中，党内一小撮死不悔改的走资派虽被广大革命群众揪出来了，但是还没有彻底批倒批臭，他们所散布的反革命修正主义流毒更远远没有肃清，一遇机会，他们就兴风作浪，向革命人民进行猖狂的反扑。大家认为，这些形形色色的阶级敌人有一个共同的反革命目标，就是要在中国复辟资本主义。有些革命领导干部，还回忆和检查了自己过去由于不抓阶级斗争，对阴险狡猾的阶级敌人缺乏应有的警惕而犯错误的教训，使到会同志受到很大教育。大家深刻地认识到：我们党的历史，就是一部阶级斗争史。伟大领袖毛主席亲自发动和领导的这场无产阶级文化大革命，就是无产阶级同资产阶级的一场大搏斗、大决战，就是我们同国民党反动派长期斗争的继续。只要阶级还存在，无产阶级同资产阶级之间的阶级斗争就不会停止。因此，我们要时刻牢记伟大领袖毛主席“千万不要忘记阶级斗争”的教导，用阶级和阶级斗争的观点，去分析一切人，分析一切社会现象。这样，才能认识形势，分清敌我，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，牢牢掌握斗争大方向，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。
    又准又狠又稳地打击阶级敌人
    到会同志认为，为了向阶级敌人发动持久的猛烈的进攻，必须在我们革命队伍内部不断加强阶级斗争和路线斗争的教育，克服右倾思想，提高无产阶级革命派和广大革命群众的阶级斗争和路线斗争觉悟。
    大家在讨论中指出，我们必须清楚地看到，无产阶级文化大革命越是接近全面胜利，阶级敌人越是要疯狂地进行垂死挣扎。他们每时每刻都在窥测方向，随着形势的变化，不断地变换反革命的策略，有时从右的方面向我们进攻，有时从极“左”方面向我们进攻，有时同时使用右的和极“左”的反革命两手。当前，阶级敌人主要是从右的方面向我们进攻，刮起了一股右倾翻案妖风。他们用尽种种毒辣和阴险的手段：有的用反革命经济主义，把我们队伍中不坚定的人拉过去；有的制造事端，挑动革命群众组织之间的斗争；有的削尖脑袋，钻进新生的革命政权，妄图从内部分裂和瓦解革命队伍；有的极力挑拨军民之间、革命群众组织之间和革委会成员之间的关系；在他们实在混不下去的时候，就无中生有，靠造谣过日子。不管阶级敌人的反革命手法变来变去，他们的矛头都是指向无产阶级司令部，指向中国人民解放军，指向新生的革命委员会，妄图达到他们复辟资本主义的罪恶目的。我们如果因为胜利而松懈了对阶级敌人的警惕，松懈了我们的斗志，就会在严重的阶级斗争面前，麻木不仁，敌我不分，甚至认敌为友，混淆了阶级阵线，这就会给阶级敌人进行破坏活动大开方便之门。
      “我们革命党人必须懂得他们这一套，必须研究他们的策略，以便战胜他们。”我们一定要用明察秋毫的毛泽东思想这个政治上的望远镜、显微镜去识别阶级敌人，不管他们伪装得多么巧妙，手法怎么变换，都会把他们揭露出来，将他们反革命的狰狞面目完全暴露在光天化日之下，彻底斗倒斗臭。
    到会同志认为，当前阶级敌人千方百计地在革命队伍内部挑拨离间，制造分裂，破坏革命的大联合和革命的三结合，破坏革命队伍的团结，瓦解革命队伍的战斗力，转移斗争的大方向。我们一定要擦亮眼睛，识破阶级敌人的阴谋诡计，要坚决反对右倾机会主义、右倾分裂主义和右倾投降主义。一切革命同志要在毛泽东思想基础上，更紧密地团结起来，牢牢地掌握斗争大方向，把斗争的矛头始终对准阶级敌人，“组织千千万万的民众，调动浩浩荡荡的革命军”，又准、又狠、又稳地打击阶级敌人的各种破坏活动。在任何情况下，都绝对不能把矛头指向任何一部分不同观点的革命群众，都绝对不能做出亲者痛仇者快的事情。
    深入持久地开展革命的大批判
    会议充分讨论了深入持久地开展革命大批判的问题。到会同志认识到，革命的大批判是向阶级敌人发动持久的猛烈的进攻的强大武器。只有把革命的大批判进行到底，才能把一小撮顽固不化的走资派和叛徒、特务从政治上思想上彻底打倒，才能把他们散布的各种反动思想的流毒肃清。也只有把革命的大批判进行到底，才能更好地大立毛泽东思想，提高广大革命人民的无产阶级觉悟。
    许多同志回顾近两年来，每当广大革命群众燃起革命大批判的熊熊烈火的关键时刻，阶级敌人就象蝙蝠害怕阳光一样，千方百计地逃避、阻挠和破坏革命的大批判。大家进一步认识到：革命的大批判，就是无产阶级同资产阶级的一场严重的阶级斗争。“凡是敌人反对的，我们就要拥护”。阶级敌人越是害怕革命的大批判，我们越是要更高地举起革命大批判的旗帜，一刻也不停顿地对阶级敌人进行大揭发、大批判、大斗争，把革命大批判热火朝天地搞起来，深入持久地开展下去。放弃了革命大批判，就是丢掉了最大的政治，丢掉了革命的大方向。
    到会同志还总结交流了开展革命大批判的经验，主要的是要以毛泽东思想为武器，并把革命大批判同当前的阶级斗争实际和各单位的阶级斗争实际结合起来，同各单位的斗、批、改结合起来。要通过革命大批判，有效地激发广大革命群众无限热爱伟大领袖毛主席和无限忠于毛泽东思想的深厚阶级感情，激发对中国赫鲁晓夫的不共戴天的深仇大恨，把党内一小撮死不悔改的走资派、叛徒、特务和一切隐藏的反革命分子，统统挖出来，铲除反革命修正主义的祸根，肃清反革命修正主义路线的流毒。在革命大批判中，还要把批修和斗私紧密地结合起来，要象黄山洞大队的贫下中农那样，做到学习毛主席的一条语录，批判中国赫鲁晓夫的一个谬论，检查一次自己头脑里的“私”字，肃清修正主义一方面的流毒。要在革命大批判的战场上，表现出我们对敌斗争的大勇，锤炼我们对毛主席的大忠，增强对修正主义的免疫力，在阶级斗争的大风大浪中，破私立公，不断促进人的思想革命化。
    到会同志一致认为，毛主席一系列的最新指示，是我们进行阶级斗争的强大思想武器。毛主席一系列最新指示的全面落实，就是无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利，就是给一切阶级敌人最沉重的歼灭性的打击。阶级敌人一定要采取各种手段阻碍毛主席最新指示的落实。因此，无论遇到什么样复杂的情况，社会上出现了什么样的干扰，我们都要高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，坚定不移地用全部精力办好毛泽东思想学习班，狠抓毛主席最新指示的落实，不断把全省活学活用毛泽东思想的伟大群众运动推向新的阶段。
