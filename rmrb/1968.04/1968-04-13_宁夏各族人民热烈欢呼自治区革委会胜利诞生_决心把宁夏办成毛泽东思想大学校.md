The people of the Hui and Han ethnic groups in Ningxia, brimming with revolutionary fervor and joy, warmly celebrate the glorious birth of the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region Revolutionary Committee, warmly celebrate another great victory of Mao Zedong Thought, and warmly celebrate another great victory of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line.

On this joyous day, from the capital city of Yinchuan to the Liupan Mountain area where Chairman Mao led the Red Army during the Long March, from the old revolutionary base area of Yanchi Grassland to the newly developed industrial city of Shizuishan, everywhere is filled with excitement. All 18 counties and cities in the autonomous region held various grand celebrations. The broad masses of revolutionary cadres, revolutionary Red Guards, and revolutionary people of all ethnic groups, with boundless love for the great leader Chairman Mao, holding the red revolutionary classic, sang "The East Is Red" with all their hearts, sincerely wishing the great leader Chairman Mao long life! The broad masses of revolutionary cadres and revolutionary people of all ethnic groups expressed that after the establishment of the autonomous region revolutionary committee, they will definitely continue to put the study and application of Mao Zedong Thought in a position higher than everything, greater than everything, earlier than everything, and heavier than everything. They will take Comrade Lin Biao as a shining example, forever be loyal to Chairman Mao, forever be loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, and forever be loyal to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, and turn the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region into a red Mao Zedong Thought school.

On the day the autonomous region revolutionary committee was established, the broad revolutionary masses reviewed Chairman Mao's latest instructions on the revolutionary committees. They said that Chairman Mao's great instructions have pointed out the fundamental direction for the construction of revolutionary committees at all levels, and we must resolutely implement them. For the newly born autonomous region revolutionary committee, we must cherish it with all our hearts, firmly support it, actively help it, and bravely defend it, so that it can be consolidated in the struggle and truly become a revolutionary command center that holds high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought.

On the joyous day of celebrating the establishment of the autonomous region revolutionary committee, the revolutionary masses of all ethnic groups seriously studied the extremely important latest instructions of the great leader Chairman Mao: "The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is, in essence, a great political revolution carried out by the proletariat against the bourgeoisie and all exploiting classes under the conditions of socialism, a continuation of the long-term struggle between the Chinese Communist Party and the reactionary Kuomintang led by the broad revolutionary masses, and a continuation of the class struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie." Upon hearing Chairman Mao's latest instructions, the newly born autonomous region revolutionary committee immediately convened a standing committee meeting to seriously study and discuss, and held an all-region telephone conference that night to convey the instructions. The broad masses of revolutionary cadres and revolutionary people of all ethnic groups said in their study and discussion that Chairman Mao's great teachings most concisely explain the great significance of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and most profoundly reveal the class content of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. Chairman Mao's latest instructions make us more clearly understand the long-term and complex nature of class struggle under socialist conditions. Amidst the sound of victory drums, we must more firmly remember Chairman Mao's great teachings of "never forgetting class struggle," firmly grasp the main thread of the struggle between the two classes, the two roads, and the two lines, further carry out the revolutionary criticism, thoroughly expose and criticize the counter-revolutionary crimes of the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents in Ningxia, Yang Jingren, Ma Yushu, and other cliques within the party, overthrow and denounce them. We must oppose rightist conservatism, rightist splitism, and rightist capitulationism, and thoroughly smash the rightist reversal wind. We must further strengthen the unity of the people of all ethnic groups, strengthen military-civilian unity, heighten revolutionary vigilance, and prevent the sabotage by the special agents of the US, the KMT, the Soviet revisionists, and the Mongolian revisionists. We must dig out all traitors, spies, unrepentant capitalist-roaders, and all counter-revolutionaries.

On the day of celebrating the establishment of the autonomous region revolutionary committee, the revolutionary people of all ethnic groups in Ningxia are even more spirited and unanimously expressed their determination to carry forward Chairman Mao's spirit of thorough proletarian revolution of "not being a hero until reaching the Great Wall," and strive forward to seize the comprehensive victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in terms of ideology, politics, economy, and organization!

    在自治区革命委员会成立的日子里，广大革命群众重温了毛主席关于革命委员会的最新指示。他们说，毛主席的这一伟大指示，为各级革命委员会的建设指出了根本方向，我们一定要坚决贯彻执行。对于新生的自治区革命委员会，我们要满腔热情地爱护，坚定不移地支持，积极热情地帮助，坚决勇敢地捍卫，使它在斗争中不断得到巩固，真正成为高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗的革命的战斗指挥部。
    在庆祝自治区革命委员会成立的大喜日子里，各族革命群众认真学习了伟大领袖毛主席极其重要的最新指示：“无产阶级文化大革命，实质上是在社会主义条件下，无产阶级反对资产阶级和一切剥削阶级的政治大革命，是中国共产党及其领导下的广大革命人民群众和国民党反动派长期斗争的继续，是无产阶级和资产阶级阶级斗争的继续。”刚刚诞生的自治区革命委员会听到毛主席的这一最新指示，立即召开常委会认真学习和讨论，并连夜召开全区电话会议，进行传达。广大无产阶级革命派和各族革命群众在学习和讨论中说，毛主席的这一伟大教导，最精辟地阐明了无产阶级文化大革命的伟大意义，最深刻地揭示了无产阶级文化大革命的阶级内容。毛主席的最新指示，使我们更加清楚地认识了在社会主义条件下，阶级斗争的长期性和复杂性。在一片胜利的锣鼓声中，我们一定要更加牢记毛主席“千万不要忘记阶级斗争”的伟大教导，狠狠抓住两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线斗争这个纲，进一步开展革命的大批判，把中国赫鲁晓夫及其在宁夏的代理人杨静仁、马玉槐等党内一小撮走资派的反革命罪行揭深揭透，批倒批臭。要反对右倾保守主义、右倾分裂主义和右倾投降主义，彻底粉碎右倾翻案妖风。要进一步加强各族人民的团结，加强军民团结，提高革命警惕，严防美蒋、苏修、蒙修特务的破坏。要把叛徒、特务、顽固不化的走资派和一切反革命分子统统挖出来。
    在欢庆自治区革命委员会成立的日子里，宁夏各族革命群众更加意气风发，一致表示要发扬毛主席的“不到长城非好汉”的无产阶级彻底革命精神，为从思想上、政治上、经济上、组织上夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利而奋勇前进！
