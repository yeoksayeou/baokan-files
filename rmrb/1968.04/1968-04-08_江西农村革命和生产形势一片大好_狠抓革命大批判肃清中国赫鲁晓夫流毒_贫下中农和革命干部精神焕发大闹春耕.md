Political work is the lifeline of all economic work.			Mao Zedong

The revolutionary and production situation in rural Jiangxi is excellent. The revolutionary mass criticism movement is being carried out extensively and in-depth, greatly raising the class consciousness and revolutionary enthusiasm of the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants, and vigorously promoting the spring ploughing production movement to be carried out in a vigorous and solid manner.

Currently, the revolutionary and production situation in rural Jiangxi is excellent and getting better. Chairman Mao's latest instructions have deeply penetrated the hearts of the people. The revolutionary mass criticism movement is being carried out extensively and in-depth. The class consciousness of the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres is continuously improving, and spring ploughing production has seen an unprecedented new high tide. This year, the preparations in terms of ideology, organization, materials, and technology for spring ploughing in various places have been relatively solid, and the progress has been rapid. Various agricultural tasks have been carried out in an orderly manner without missing the agricultural season. Now, from the southern Nanling Mountains to the northern shores of Poyang Lake, seeds for spring sowing have generally been put into the fields, and the early ones have already sprouted. The enthusiasm of the community members and revolutionary cadres is surging, and everywhere is a bustling scene of spring ploughing.

Various places in rural areas are holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, vigorously carrying out class struggle, and fiercely criticizing the reactionary fallacies advocated by the Chinese Khrushchev, such as the theory of "extinction of class struggle," thoroughly eliminating its poison, and vigorously promoting spring ploughing. The rural areas of Shangrao Prefecture, in carrying out the revolutionary mass criticism movement, have launched a mass movement to expose, criticize, and eliminate the poison of Chinese Khrushchev's conspiracy to restore capitalism in rural areas. At the same time, they have also carried out a mass criticism and struggle against the activities of a small handful of capitalist roaders within the local party who collude with ghosts and snakes to sabotage the collective economy and spring ploughing production. This has strengthened the unity of the poor and lower-middle peasants, further consolidated and developed the revolutionary great alliance and the revolutionary three-in-one combination, and brought about a new high tide in revolution and production. Last winter, due to drought, the growth of red grass in the entire prefecture was affected. This spring, the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants, undaunted by wind and snow, launched a mass movement to dig pond mud, accumulate household fertilizer, and strengthen field management. The poor and lower-middle peasants and grassroots cadres of Guixi County, through mass criticism, have directed their surging enthusiasm towards seizing the revolution and promoting production. The amount of fertilizer accumulated in the entire county last winter and this spring is more than in any previous year, and spring ploughing is proceeding quickly and well.

The revolutionary mass criticism carried out in various rural areas is combined with the actual situation of the region and the production brigade, thoroughly eliminating the poison and uprooting the source of the poison. The poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres of more than ten communes such as Xinwei, Hengjiang, and Tongping in Jian County have fiercely criticized the bourgeois reactionary line of the Chinese Khrushchev, organizing the brigade cadres to recall and compare. They recall the bitterness of the old society, the bitterness of the bourgeois reactionary line of the Chinese Khrushchev, and the sweetness of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, contrasting themselves to see if they have truly served the people "completely" and "thoroughly," and examining themselves to see if they have forgotten their roots after liberation. Because the poison of the bourgeois reactionary line is criticized fiercely and deeply, the vast majority of brigade cadres, with the help of the poor and lower-middle peasants, have straightened their backs and rushed to the frontline of spring ploughing, establishing and strengthening the grassroots revolutionary leading bodies, and timely strengthening the leadership of spring ploughing. Currently, the poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres of these communes are full of enthusiasm, hurriedly preparing sufficient fertilizer, ploughing and leveling the seedling fields, rushing to build water conservancy projects, and strengthening the management of green manure and spring crops.

Various rural areas, in accordance with Chairman Mao's instruction that "holding study classes is a good method, and many problems can be solved in study classes," insist on holding Mao Zedong Thought study classes during the busy spring ploughing season, further carrying out revolutionary mass criticism, and continuously carrying out self-criticism and criticism of revisionism. The rural areas of Ganzhou Prefecture, during spring ploughing production, moved the study classes to the fields and water conservancy construction sites, and held a large number of family self-criticism and criticism of revisionism meetings, further criticizing the black goods promoted by the Chinese Khrushchev, such as "three selfs and one package" and "four freedoms." Through mass criticism, the broad masses of community members have drawn clear lines in their minds between public and private, between socialism and capitalism, and between the two ideologies and the two roads, and have become even more fond of the collective economy. Their enthusiasm for production is surging, and more than 90% of the labor force in the entire prefecture has been invested in spring ploughing production. Various spring ploughing tasks are being carried out in a hot and solid manner. Dongfanghong Commune in Yiyang County, during the holding of study classes, guided the cadres and community members to criticize and discuss the harms of "work points as the commander" and "material rewards," and to specially discuss the benefits of "political command." Many poor and lower-middle peasants, through self-criticism and criticism of revisionism, have raised their awareness of farming for the revolution. Many production brigades have also implemented the labor management methods of Dazhai, implementing political command, greatly promoting the thought revolutionization of the community members. The community members' enthusiasm for production is even greater, the labor attendance rate has significantly increased, and various agricultural tasks are being carried out quickly and well.

The Guangzhou Military Region's unit stationed on Hainan Island, in supporting spring ploughing production, has put the propaganda of Mao Zedong Thought and the implementation of Chairman Mao's latest instructions in the first place. This is a scene of the soldiers and officers of the Third Battalion studying Chairman Mao's quotations with the Li ethnic community members during their rest time in the fields.

    江西农村革命和生产形势一片大好
    狠抓革命大批判肃清中国赫鲁晓夫流毒  贫下中农和革命干部精神焕发大闹春耕
    据新华社南昌七日电江西广大农村持续深入开展着的革命大批判运动，大大提高了广大贫下中农的阶级觉悟和革命干劲，有力地推动春耕生产运动轰轰烈烈、扎扎实实地开展。
    当前，江西农村革命和生产形势一片大好，越来越好。毛主席的一系列最新指示深入人心，革命大批判持续深入地展开。广大贫下中农和革命干部的阶级觉悟不断提高，春耕生产出现了前所未有的新高潮。今年各地春耕的思想准备、组织准备、物质准备和技术准备等工作，都做得比较落实，进度迅速。各项农活也做到不误农时，有条不紊。现在，南起南岭，北至鄱阳湖畔，春播种籽普遍下田，早的已露绿芽，社员革命干劲焕发，处处是一片春耕繁忙喜象。
    各地农村高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，狠抓阶级斗争，狠批中国赫鲁晓夫鼓吹的“阶级斗争熄灭”论等反动谬论，彻底肃清其流毒，有力地推动了春耕。上饶专区农村在开展革命大批判中，对中国赫鲁晓夫在农村阴谋搞资本主义复辟的流毒，展开了群众性的大揭发、大批判、大消毒。同时，对当地党内一小撮死不悔改的走资派勾结牛鬼蛇神，破坏集体经济，破坏春耕生产的活动，也进行了大批判、大斗争。从而增强了贫下中农的团结，革命大联合和革命三结合得到进一步的巩固和发展，革命、生产出现新高潮。全区各地去冬因干旱影响，红花草生长受到危害，今春广大贫下中农不畏风雪，掀起了大挖塘泥，大积家肥，加强田间管理的热潮。贵溪县广大贫下中农和农村基层干部，通过大批判，把焕发出来的干劲都用到抓革命、促生产上去，去冬今春全县积的肥料比过去任何一年都多，春耕又快又好。
    各地农村开展的革命大批判，同本地区、本社队的实际结合起来，彻底清除毒素，挖掉毒根。吉安县新圩、横江、桐坪等十多个公社的贫下中农和革命干部，狠批中国赫鲁晓夫的资产阶级反动路线，组织社队干部回忆对比。他们忆旧社会的苦，忆中国赫鲁晓夫的资产阶级反动路线的苦，比毛主席无产阶级革命路线的甜，对照自己是否做到了“完全”“彻底”为人民服务，检查自己是否翻身忘本。由于对资产阶级反动路线的流毒批得狠，挖得深，绝大多数社队干部在贫下中农的帮助下，挺起腰杆，杀上春耕第一线，建立、健全了基层的革命领导班子，及时加强了对春耕的领导。目前，这些公社的贫下中农和革命干部，干劲冲天，正在加紧备足肥料，犁耙秧田，突击搞水利，加强绿肥和春熟作物的后期管理。
    各地农村遵照毛主席“办学习班，是个好办法，很多问题可以在学习班得到解决”的教导，在春耕大忙季节坚持把毛泽东思想学习班办下去，进一步深入开展革命大批判，不断地开展斗私批修。赣州专区农村在春耕生产中把学习班搬到田头、水利工地去办，并办了大批家庭斗私批修会，进一步批判中国赫鲁晓夫所推行的“三自一包”、“四大自由”等黑货。广大社员通过大批判，从思想上划清了公与私的界线，划清了社会主义和资本主义的界线，划清了两种思想、两条道路的界线，更加热爱集体经济，生产积极性日益高涨，全区投入春耕生产的劳动力达百分之九十以上。各项春耕工作都搞得热火朝天，扎扎实实。宜黄县东方红公社，在办学习班中，引导干部、社员，大摆大批“工分挂帅”，“物质奖励”的害处，大讲特讲“政治挂帅”的好处。许多贫下中农通过斗私批修，提高了为革命种田的觉悟。许多生产队还推行了大寨式劳动管理办法，实行政治挂帅，大大促进了社员思想革命化。社员生产干劲更大，劳动出勤率显著增高，各项农活做得又快又好。（附图片）
    广州部队驻海南岛某部在支援春耕生产中，把宣传毛泽东思想，落实毛主席最新指示放在第一位。这是三营指战员和黎族社员一起，利用休息时间在田头学习毛主席语录。
