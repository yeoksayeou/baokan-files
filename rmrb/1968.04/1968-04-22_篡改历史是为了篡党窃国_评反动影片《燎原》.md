After the 20th Congress of the CPSU, the Khrushchev revisionist clique launched a counterrevolutionary current to revise the history of the CPSU and completely negate Stalin. The Chinese Khrushchev followed suit, crazily shouting, “History can always be revised. The CPSU history that Stalin wrote has now been revised. China… is now writing history again.” In a few words, the Chinese Khrushchev fully exposed his wolfish ambitions. Under the Chinese Khrushchev’s shout of “History can always be revised,” a small group of counterrevolutionary revisionists in the literary and artistic circles waved their black pens and grossly falsified history. They meticulously produced the reactionary film "Spark," striking up the counterrevolutionary drums in the literary and artistic field for the Chinese Khrushchev to seize the party and usurp the state.

The Great Deception of Distorting History

Anshan is the sacred place where our great leader Chairman Mao personally pioneered the Chinese workers’ movement. The famous Anshan coal mine workers’ strike of 1922 was a great revolutionary innovation led by Chairman Mao in the Chinese workers’ movement. As early as the autumn of 1921, Chairman Mao personally went to Anshan to understand the workers’ hardships and awaken the workers’ class consciousness. Subsequently, he established a party branch and the Anshan Road and Mine Workers’ Club in Anshan, uniting, educating, and organizing tens of thousands of workers, and fully prepared the ideological and organizational groundwork for the Anshan workers’ strike. In September 1922, our great leader Chairman Mao once again went to Anshan and made detailed battle arrangements for the strike, leading the strike that shocked the world to victory.

However, the creators of the reactionary film "Spark" maliciously distorted and falsified this glorious history. The entire film completely erased the historical fact of Chairman Mao leading the Chinese workers’ movement and the Anshan strike, removing the fundamental reason for the victory of the Anshan strike. On the contrary, it exaggerated the image of the Chinese Khrushchev, portraying him as the “pioneer” and “leader” of the Anshan workers’ movement. This is a great deception of distorting history! What is the Chinese Khrushchev? As early as the 1920s, he was a thorough scab and traitor! His deeds in Anshan were to push the right-opportunist capitulationist line. He suppressed the workers’ revolutionary struggles, disintegrated the workers’ ranks, colluded with the capitalists to suppress the workers’ movement, and betrayed the revolutionary achievements of the Anshan strike. In 1925, after the workers’ movement suffered brutal suppression by the reactionaries, he fled to Changsha, was arrested, and crawled out of a doghole, kneeling before the enemy. He is an old traitor who has betrayed his soul. What “leader of the workers’ movement” and “old revolutionary”? In reality, he is a pile of stinking dog shit! The creators of "Spark" applied heavy makeup to such a traitor who sold his soul, dressing him up as a “hero” and elevating him to the heavens, deliberately fabricating a political deception to deceive the world, and their intentions are clear to all!

To achieve their unspoken political purposes, the creators of the reactionary film "Spark" used extremely vile and shameless methods. They changed day into night, attributing Chairman Mao’s great achievements in leading the Anshan workers’ movement to the Chinese Khrushchev. They dipped their pens in ink, depicting the Chinese Khrushchev’s incarnation, Lei Huanjue, coming to Anshan, from “enlightening one person with two hands” to organizing the strike, and finally achieving victory. After such a fabrication, the Chinese Khrushchev became the “initiator” and “leader” of the Anshan strike.

This is a complete forgery of history. The Chinese Khrushchev was not even in Anshan at that time. It was only two days before the strike that he came to Anshan to seize the revolutionary opportunity. On the second day of the strike, he requested to “negotiate” with the capitalists. On the fourth day, he signed an agreement with the enemy, selling out the strike struggle at a low price. What is even more intolerable is that the film creators even plagiarized some of Chairman Mao’s publicly stated revolutionary theories, attributing them as the “inventions” of the Chinese Khrushchev. Chairman Mao had already pointed out in the "Xiangjiang Review": “What force is the strongest? The force of the masses is the strongest. What should not be feared? The sky should not be feared, ghosts should not be feared, the dead should not be feared, officials should not be feared, warlords should not be feared, capitalists should not be feared.” The film changed this, turning it into the “thoughts” of the Chinese Khrushchev, spoken through Lei Huanjue’s mouth: “As long as the workers unite, they fear neither heaven nor earth, nor gods nor ghosts, nor warlords, nor capitalists!” The film thus shamelessly falsified and plagiarized history, desperately trying to whitewash the Chinese Khrushchev, which is extremely despicable!

To dress up the great scab and traitor as the “leader of the workers’ movement,” the film also used the method of deceiving heaven and earth, completely erasing the Chinese Khrushchev’s heinous crimes against the Anshan workers’ movement. In July 1923, the Anshan workers broke through the various shackles imposed on them by the Chinese Khrushchev and engaged in a head-on struggle against the capitalists. At this time, the Chinese Khrushchev tore off his mask, revealing his ferocious face, labeling all revolutionary workers who opposed him as “bad elements.” He also used his usurped authority to expel 140 revolutionary workers from the club. History has proven that this Chinese Khrushchev was already a butcher who brutally suppressed the workers’ movement in the 1920s and a faithful henchman of imperialism and the bourgeoisie. The film directors, however, covered the Chinese Khrushchev’s hideous face with layer upon layer of makeup. They called him the workers’ “confidant,” “brain,” “affable,” and “approachable,” among other things. They even had an old worker, Yi Laoji, say: “In these decades, which time did we not listen to the mine’s orders? It was only when Old Lei came… that the club was established, and the workers finally had a backbone and a mainstay.” Who is speaking for the workers? Clearly, these are the flattering words of the Chinese Khrushchev’s lackeys! Similar cover-ups and praises of the Chinese Khrushchev’s evil history are everywhere in the film.

The creators of the reactionary film "Spark" arbitrarily falsified history, erasing the great history of our great leader Chairman Mao leading the Chinese workers’ movement, and fabricated many “achievements” for the Chinese Khrushchev, elevating this great scab to the throne of the “leader of the workers’ movement.” This fully exposed the evil intentions of these counterrevolutionary trumpeters and small crawlers to restore capitalism!

The Banner of Opportunism

The reactionary film "Spark" aims to clear the way for the Chinese Khrushchev to seize the party and usurp the state to restore capitalism, using another counterrevolutionary trick: fervently beautifying and advocating the opportunist line that the Chinese Khrushchev has always pursued, counterattacking Chairman Mao’s proletarian revolutionary line.

Chairman Mao taught us: “All revolutionary struggles in the world are for the purpose of seizing power and consolidating power.” In our country, “there is no parliament that can be utilized, no legal right for workers to organize strikes. Here, the task of the Communist Party is basically not to enter into insurrection and war through long-term legal struggles, nor to first occupy the cities and then the countryside, but to take the opposite path.” Chairman Mao’s great teachings have illuminated a path of brilliant victory for the Chinese revolution, which is to use armed revolution to oppose armed counterrevolution, to surround the cities from the countryside, and finally to seize power.

However, the reactionary film "Spark" arbitrarily distorted and falsified the great history of Chairman Mao leading the Anshan workers’ struggle, completely erasing the political essence of the Anshan strike, describing it as a purely “economic struggle” and “legal struggle.” The film vigorously emphasized the workers’ economic demands, portraying them as a crowd of people who were afraid of losing their “rice bowls” and had no revolutionary ideals. The one praised as the “savior” in the film, Lei Huanjue, never called on the workers to struggle against the capitalists and overthrow the reactionary rule but used “welfare benefits” to “build relationships,” using economism to corrupt the workers’ fighting spirit, urging them to “be content with their lot” and “cultivate virtue,” completely abandoning the fundamental principle of the proletarian revolution to seize power. The film emphasized the scene of “thousands of workers cheering” after the “victory” of the “economic struggle.” An old worker grabbed Lei Huanjue’s hand, tears in his eyes, saying: “This—this is true? We workers are no longer beasts of burden, but we are people?” Through these illusions, the film vigorously advocated the Chinese Khrushchev’s counterrevolutionary formula: “Everything for economic struggle, economic struggle is everything.”

This counterrevolutionary economism is the Chinese Khrushchev’s consistent tool for destroying and suppressing the workers’ movement. In Anshan at that time, he used the tone of the traitor Chen Duxiu, maliciously slandering the proletariat as “immature” and unable to “seize power.” He wrote a “manifesto,” shamelessly declaring that the strike was “completely spontaneous and had nothing to do with politics and the military!” Later, he also proposed the infamous reactionary slogan “The development of economic struggle is the development of the Chinese workers’ movement,” attempting to limit the masses’ revolutionary struggle to begging the reactionaries for a few crumbs of immediate “welfare,” separating it from political struggle and the revolutionary path of armed seizure of power. The reactionary film "Spark" took out this garbage from the historical dump and flaunted it, aiming to rehabilitate the opportunist capitulationist line that the Chinese Khrushchev has been pushing. After the Anshan strike began, the broad revolutionary workers, following Chairman Mao’s teachings, insisted on brave struggles, preparing to repel the reactionaries’ counterattacks. The Chinese Khrushchev, however, quickly wrote letters to the mine bureau and the local reactionary government, requesting “mediation.” When he went to “negotiate,” he scolded the workers, saying, “Don’t make trouble,” “return to your rooms, and don’t cause trouble,” “be more civilized than usual.” He also declared: “I have no grudge against them (the capitalists). I am going to mediate.” What a “no grudge”! Which side the Chinese Khrushchev stood on and which faction he belonged to was not clear? Indeed, at the “negotiation” table, he made a dirty deal with the capitalists, accepting the capitalists’ three conditions of “maintaining order,” and deleting and modifying nine of the workers’ seventeen demands, completely betraying the workers’ interests. After that, whenever the workers came to struggle against the capitalists, he came out to “negotiate,” acting as the capitalists’ “mediator.” For example, in June 1923, the Anshan workers launched a new revolutionary storm, and the capitalists were at a loss, hurriedly asking the Chinese Khrushchev to “mediate.” He “consulted” with the capitalists for half a month and finally signed a surrender “agreement.” This “agreement” even ordered the workers to “obey the rules,” “not to gather and make noise to blackmail,” and “not to strike and disrupt work.” What kind of “negotiation” was this! Clearly, it was using “negotiation” as a cover to sell out the workers’ interests.

Chairman Mao’s great revolutionary theory and his brilliant struggle in leading the Chinese revolution made the people of our country and the revolutionary people of the world deeply realize: without political struggle, abandoning the revolutionary path of armed seizure of power, what “economic struggle” and what “parliamentary road” are all deceptions to betray the interests of the proletariat, and are the decorations and henchmen of the bourgeois reactionary regime. The glorious history of the Chinese revolution has long pronounced the death sentence on the opportunist capitulationist line advocated by Chen Duxiu, Wang Ming, and the Chinese Khrushchev of pure “economic struggle” and “parliamentary road.”

However, after decades of historical progress, the creators of the reactionary film "Spark" brought out this corpse of the opportunist capitulationist line again, pretending to be the proletarian revolutionary line. The film "Spark" not only covered up the evil consequences of the Chinese Khrushchev’s opportunist capitulationist line at that time but also maliciously set up a glorious prospect for his so-called “workers’ movement” that followed the counterrevolutionary economism and “parliamentary road,” hinting through the title “Spark” that this opportunist compromise and capitulationist line would ignite the “spark” of the Chinese revolution and spread it throughout the world. At the end, it loudly shouted “long live” for this false “economic struggle” and “legal struggle” “victory”! Is this not openly advocating for the opportunist, counterrevolutionary revisionist line that the Chinese Khrushchev has always followed? Is this not a mad counterattack against Chairman Mao’s correct path of surrounding the cities from the countryside and armed seizure of power? Is this not adding to the counterrevolutionary genealogy for the Chinese Khrushchev, helping him gain “political capital” to seize the party and usurp the state? Is this not closely cooperating with the Chinese Khrushchev’s “three surrenders and one annihilation” counterrevolutionary revisionist line, attempting to extinguish the blazing fire of world revolution? The creators of the film raised the banner of opportunism to fully attack Chairman Mao’s proletarian revolutionary line, creating public opinion for the Chinese Khrushchev to seize the party and usurp the state and restore capitalism.

Clearly, they are scabs and traitors, but they insist on dressing up as “leaders of the workers” and “heroes.” Clearly, they are opportunist capitulationist lines, but they insist on pretending to be proletarian revolutionary lines. The creators of the reactionary film "Spark" were so brazen in falsifying history because this is an important step for the Chinese Khrushchev to seize the party and usurp the state to restore capitalism. Wasn’t their ancestor Khrushchev using the revision of the CPSU history as his first step to completely restore capitalism by thoroughly opposing Stalin? The Chinese Khrushchev has also been revising and fabricating history to prepare public opinion for his seizure of the party and usurpation of the state to restore capitalism. The reactionary film "Spark" is just an episode in his artistic performance. It was precisely around the time when the reactionary film "Spark" was released that the Chinese Khrushchev intensified his conspiracy to seize the party and usurp the state. At that time, he hysterically shouted: “The old ones are no good… they have to step down and make way.” “Don’t shout long live to the living anymore!” “Rather than you seize the party, it’s better for me to seize the party!” How arrogant!

However, history is stern. The Chinese Khrushchev, who madly opposed our great leader Chairman Mao, was exposed by the proletarian revolutionary faction, and his conspiracy to seize the party and usurp the state to restore capitalism failed! His name and body will perish together, and the river will flow forever! The Chinese Khrushchev and his small crawlers mocked history and were eventually spat out by history. At that time, the Chinese Khrushchev proudly shouted: “China… is now writing history again?” Yes, China is now writing history. However, this is the history of millions of proletarian revolutionaries, under the command of our great leader Chairman Mao, writing the most brilliant and glorious history in human history. This is the history of the proletariat’s roaring advance and victory after victory, and it is also the history of the imperialists, revisionists, reactionaries, and the Chinese Khrushchev and his ilk collapsing and heading towards annihilation!

    篡改历史是为了篡党窃国——评反动影片《燎原》
    安展
    苏共二十大以后，赫鲁晓夫修正主义集团掀起了一股篡改苏共党史、全盘否定斯大林的反革命逆流。中国赫鲁晓夫也步其后尘，疯狂叫嚣：“历史总是可以修改的，联共党史斯大林写过了，现在还是修改了。中国……，现在不是又在写历史吗？”寥寥数语，彻底地暴露出中国赫鲁晓夫的狼子野心。在中国赫鲁晓夫“历史总是可以修改”的叫嚣下，文艺界的一小撮反革命修正主义分子，摇动黑笔杆，大肆篡改历史。他们精心炮制的反动影片《燎原》，从文艺领域为中国赫鲁晓夫敲响了篡党窃国的反革命锣鼓。
        颠倒历史的大骗局
    安源，是我们伟大领袖毛主席亲手开拓的中国工人运动的光辉圣地。著名的一九二二年安源煤矿工人大罢工，是毛主席领导中国工人运动的伟大革命创举。早在一九二一年秋，毛主席就亲自到安源深入了解工人疾苦，启发工人的阶级觉悟。随后又在安源建立了党支部和安源路矿工人俱乐部，团结、教育和组织了上万名工人，为安源工人大罢工做好了充分的思想准备和组织准备。一九二二年九月，我们伟大领袖毛主席再次亲临安源，并为大罢工作了具体详尽的战斗部署，领导这场震惊中外的大罢工取得了胜利。
    但是，反动影片《燎原》的炮制者却对这段光辉历史，作了恶毒的歪曲和篡改。整个影片，完全抹煞了毛主席领导中国工人运动和安源大罢工的历史事实，抽去了安源大罢工取得胜利的根本原因。相反的，却大塑特塑中国赫鲁晓夫的形象，把他美化为安源工运的“元勋”和“领袖”。这是一个颠倒历史的大骗局！中国赫鲁晓夫算什么东西？早在二十年代，他就是一个不折不扣的大工贼、大叛徒！他在安源干的勾当，就是推行右倾机会主义投降路线。他压制工人革命斗争，瓦解工人队伍，伙同资本家镇压工人运动，出卖安源大罢工的革命成果。一九二五年，当工人运动遭到反动派残酷镇压后，他逃到长沙，被捕了，卑躬屈膝地拜倒在敌人面前，从狗洞里爬了出来。是个叛变成性的老叛徒。什么“工运领袖”、“老革命”？实实在在是一堆臭不可闻的狗屎！《燎原》的炮制者把这样一个出卖灵魂的叛徒，浓施粉黛，打扮成了“英雄”，捧到了九天之上，别有用心地为他编造了一场欺世盗名的政治大骗局，其司马昭之心，路人皆知！
    为了达到不可告人的政治目的，反动影片《燎原》的炮制者采取了极其恶劣、极其无耻的手法。他们偷天换日，把毛主席当年领导安源工人运动的丰功伟绩，硬是安到中国赫鲁晓夫的头上。他们饱蘸笔墨，表现中国赫鲁晓夫的化身雷焕觉来到安源后，从“一人两手”的启蒙教育，到开展罢工，直到最后取得胜利。经过这样一番胡编瞎造，中国赫鲁晓夫就成了安源大罢工的“发动者”和“领导者”。
    这是彻头彻尾的伪造历史。中国赫鲁晓夫当时根本不在安源，直到罢工前两天，他才投革命之机来到安源。罢工第二天，他就请求资本家“谈判”。第四天，就同敌人签订了协定，对罢工斗争进行廉价大拍卖。更加不能容忍的是，影片炮制者竟剽窃毛主席一些公开阐明的革命理论，作为中国赫鲁晓夫的“发明”。毛主席早在《湘江评论》中就指出：“什么力量最强？民众联合的力量最强。什么不要怕？天不要怕，鬼不要怕，死人不要怕，官僚不要怕，军阀不要怕，资本家不要怕。”影片却把它改头换面，变成了中国赫鲁晓夫的“思想”，通过雷焕觉的口说了出来：“只要工人齐心，就天不怕，地不怕，神鬼不怕，军阀不怕，资本家不怕！……”影片就是这样不择手段地篡改和剽窃历史，竭力为中国赫鲁晓夫涂脂抹粉，真是卑鄙之极！
    为了把大工贼、大叛徒打扮成“工运领袖”，影片还采取瞒天过海的手法，一笔勾消了中国赫鲁晓夫对安源工人运动犯下的滔天罪行。一九二三年七月，安源工人冲破了中国赫鲁晓夫强加给他们的种种束缚，同资本家展开了针锋相对的反解雇斗争。这时，中国赫鲁晓夫便撕下假面具，凶相毕露，把反对他的革命工人统统打成“恶劣分子”，并且利用他窃取的职权，一下子开除了一百四十名革命工人的俱乐部部籍。历史证明，这个中国赫鲁晓夫，早在二十年代就是一个残酷镇压工人运动的刽子手，就是帝国主义、资产阶级的得力帮凶。影片编导者却给中国赫鲁晓夫的狰狞鬼脸上，贴上了一层层画皮。什么工人的“贴心人”啦、“头脑”啦，什么“可亲”、“平易近人”啦，不一而足。他们甚至通过老工人易老倌说：“这几十年，哪一回闹事情不是听矿上一个个的摆布？好不容易来了老雷……办起俱乐部，工人才算有了靠山，有了主心骨。”这哪里是工人的声音？分明是中国赫鲁晓夫狗奴才们肉麻的谄媚之辞！类似这种掩盖中国赫鲁晓夫罪恶历史的美化与吹捧，影片中俯拾皆是。
    反动影片《燎原》的炮制者肆意篡改历史，抹煞我们伟大领袖毛主席领导中国工人运动的伟大历史，却无中生有为中国赫鲁晓夫“虚构”出许多“功绩”，硬把这个大工贼捧上“工运领袖”的宝座，这充分暴露了这帮反革命吹鼓手、小爬虫们复辟资本主义的险恶用心！
      机会主义路线的招魂幡
    反动影片《燎原》要为中国赫鲁晓夫篡党窃国实行资本主义复辟扫清道路，采用的另一种反革命伎俩是：狂热地美化和宣扬中国赫鲁晓夫所一贯推行的机会主义路线，向毛主席的无产阶级革命路线反攻倒算。
    毛主席教导我们：“世界上一切革命斗争都是为着夺取政权，巩固政权。”在我国“无议会可以利用，无组织工人举行罢工的合法权利。在这里，共产党的任务，基本地不是经过长期合法斗争以进入起义和战争，也不是先占城市后取乡村，而是走相反的道路。”毛主席这些伟大教导，为中国革命指明了一条光辉胜利的道路，这就是用武装的革命反对武装的反革命，以农村包围城市，最后夺取政权的道路。
    但是，反动影片《燎原》却恣意歪曲篡改毛主席领导安源工人斗争的伟大历史，完全抹煞了安源大罢工的政治斗争实质，把它描写为一场单纯的“经济斗争”和“合法斗争”。影片十分卖力地渲染工人的经济要求，把他们丑化为动不动就怕“饭瓢子过河”，没有半点革命理想的芸芸众生。被影片吹捧为“救世主”的雷焕觉，从来不号召工人同资本家斗争，推翻反动统治，却拿“福利待遇”去“联络感情”，用经济主义腐蚀工人斗志，要他们“安分守己”，“涵养德性”，完全背弃了工人阶级夺取政权的这个革命根本原则。影片着意渲染“经济斗争”暂时取得“胜利”后千百万工人“欢声雷动”的情景。一个老工人抓着雷焕觉的手，眼里噙着热泪说：“这——这是真的？我们工人不再作牛马，要做人了？……”影片通过这些假象，竭力宣扬中国赫鲁晓夫的一个反革命公式：“一切为着经济斗争，经济斗争就是一切。”
    这种反革命经济主义，是中国赫鲁晓夫一贯破坏和镇压工人运动的杀手锏。当年在安源时，他就操着叛徒陈独秀的腔调，恶毒污蔑工人阶级“幼稚”，不能“实行夺取政权”。他当时写了一个《宣言》，无耻地表白罢工“完全出于自动，与政治军事不发生关系的呵！”后来，他还提出“经济斗争之发展，即为中国职工运动之发展”这一臭名昭著的反动口号，企图把群众革命斗争局限于向反动派乞求点滴眼前的“福利”，而脱离政治斗争，脱离武装夺取政权的革命道路。反动影片《燎原》把这种历史垃圾堆中的破烂拿出来炫耀兜售，目的是为中国赫鲁晓夫推行的机会主义投降路线翻案。安源大罢工开始后，广大革命工人按照毛主席的教导，坚持英勇斗争，准备打退反动派的反扑。中国赫鲁晓夫却连忙给矿局和当地反动政府写信，要求“调商”。他去“谈判”时，斥责工人“不要瞎闹”，
  “各归住房，不得扰乱”，“当比平时更加文明”。他还宣称：“我和他们（资本家）没有仇，我是去调解的”。好一个“没有仇”！中国赫鲁晓夫站在哪一边，属于哪一派，不是清清楚楚吗！果然，在“谈判”桌上，他和资本家进行了一笔肮脏的买卖，接受了资本家
  “维持秩序”等三项条件，还把工人提出的十七项条件，删砍和修改了九项，完全叛卖了工人的利益。此后，只要工人一起来同资本家斗争，他就出来“谈判”，充当资本家的“调停”人。如一九二三年六月，安源工人重新掀起了革命风暴，资本家辗转无策，急忙又请中国赫鲁晓夫去“调停”。他同资本家“磋商”了半个月，最后订了一个投降“协定”。这个“协定”竟勒令工人“遵守规则”，“不得动辄聚众喧扰要挟，并不得动辄罢工妨碍工作。”这哪里是什么“谈判”！分明是拿“谈判”当招牌，对工人利益进行大叛卖。
    毛主席的伟大革命理论和毛主席领导中国革命的光辉斗争实践，使我国人民和全世界革命人民深切地认识到：脱离了政治斗争，背弃了武装夺取政权的革命道路，什么“经济斗争”、什么“议会道路”，全是叛卖无产阶级利益的骗局，是资产阶级反动政权的装饰品和帮凶。中国革命的光辉历史，早就无情地宣判了从陈独秀、王明到中国赫鲁晓夫所鼓吹的单纯“经济斗争”、“议会道路”的死刑。
    但是，历史向前推进了几十年，反动影片《燎原》的炮制者重新又把这具机会主义投降路线的僵尸抬了出来，冒充无产阶级革命路线。影片《燎原》不但掩盖了中国赫鲁晓夫当年推行机会主义投降路线的恶果，而且还心怀叵测地为他那种奉行反革命经济主义和“议会道路”的所谓“工人运动”，虚设了辉煌的前景，通过片名“燎原”暗示：这种机会主义妥协投降路线，势将点燃中国革命的“燎原”烈火，并且燃遍全世界。并在结尾时为这种虚假的“经济斗争”和“合法斗争”的
  “胜利”大呼“万岁”！这不是明目张胆地为中国赫鲁晓夫所一贯推行的机会主义、反革命修正主义路线张目吗？这不是向毛主席的以农村包围城市，武装夺取政权的正确道路疯狂反扑吗？这不是在为中国赫鲁晓夫续反革命家谱，为他捞取篡党窃国的“政治资本”吗？这不是紧密配合中国赫鲁晓夫“三降一灭”的反革命修正主义路线，妄图扑灭世界革命的熊熊烈火吗？影片炮制者打起机会主义的招魂幡，为的是全面攻击毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，为中国赫鲁晓夫篡党窃国、复辟资本主义制造舆论。
    明明是工贼和叛徒，偏要装扮成“工人领袖”和“英雄”，明明是机会主义投降路线，偏要冒充无产阶级革命路线。反动影片《燎原》的炮制者们之所以如此肆无忌惮地篡改历史，就因为这是中国赫鲁晓夫实行篡党窃国复辟资本主义的一个重要步骤。他们的老祖宗赫鲁晓夫不就是把篡改苏共党史，作为他大反斯大林、全面复辟资本主义的头一步吗？中国赫鲁晓夫也一直在篡改历史和伪造历史，为他篡党窃国复辟资本主义大做舆论准备。反动影片《燎原》，只不过是他表现于文艺的一个插曲而已。也正在反动影片《燎原》出笼前后，中国赫鲁晓夫加紧了他篡党窃国的阴谋活动。当时他歇斯底里地叫嚣：“老的不行了……要下台，要让位。”“不要再喊活着的人万岁了！”“与其你篡党，还不如我篡党！”好不嚣张！
    但是，历史是严峻的。疯狂反对我们伟大领袖毛主席的中国赫鲁晓夫被无产阶级革命派揪了出来，他篡党窃国、复辟资本主义的阴谋破产了！尔曹身与名俱灭，不废江河万古流！中国赫鲁晓夫及其小爬虫嘲弄历史，终被历史所唾弃。想当年，中国赫鲁晓夫何等得意地叫嚷：“中国……，现在不是又在写历史吗？”是的，中国现在又在写历史。不过，这是千百万无产阶级革命派，在我们伟大的统帅毛主席指挥下，挥起大笔在写人类历史上最光辉灿烂的历史，这是无产阶级呼啸奋进、节节胜利的历史，也是帝、修、反及中国赫鲁晓夫之流土崩瓦解、日趋灭亡的历史！
