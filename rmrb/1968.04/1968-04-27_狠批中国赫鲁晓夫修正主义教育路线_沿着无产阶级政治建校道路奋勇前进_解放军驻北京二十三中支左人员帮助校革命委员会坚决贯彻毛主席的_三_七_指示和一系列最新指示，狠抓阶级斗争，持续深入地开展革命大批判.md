According to a Xinhua News Agency report dated April 26, the support-left personnel of a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army stationed at Beijing No. 23 Middle School have been resolutely implementing Chairman Mao's March 7th directive and a series of his latest instructions. They have been helping the school's revolutionary committee to focus on class struggle and to carry out a sustained and in-depth revolutionary criticism, walking the path of emphasizing proletarian politics.

Focusing on Revolutionary Criticism to Launch a Sustained Attack on Class Enemies

Soon after the establishment of the revolutionary committee of No. 23 Middle School, the support-left personnel helped the committee members to seriously study Chairman Mao's teachings on class struggle. They also used various facts from the school's class struggles to raise everyone's awareness of class struggle. Everyone discussed how to consolidate the newly born revolutionary committee by addressing their own active thoughts. They realized that after the proletarian revolutionary factions won the struggle against a handful of capitalist-roaders within the party, they must lead the proletariat and the revolutionary masses in a struggle against the enemies of the proletarian revolution to consolidate the proletarian revolutionary power.

After raising their awareness, the revolutionary committee actively led the revolutionary teachers and students of the entire school to firmly grasp the direction of the struggle. They carried out a deep revolutionary criticism, severely criticizing the heinous crimes of the Chinese Khrushchev and a handful of capitalist-roaders within the party who attempted to restore capitalism. The revolutionary teachers and students of the entire school used big-character posters, small-character posters, blackboard newspapers, and broadcasts, as well as large and small meetings, to focus on criticizing the "theory of the extinction of class struggle" of the Chinese Khrushchev. They exposed how a handful of class enemies in the school, unwilling to accept their demise, attempted to reverse the verdict, incite the masses, create incidents, and use various means to undermine the authority of the revolutionary committee. They maliciously plotted to overthrow the newly born revolutionary committee. The revolutionary criticism greatly enhanced the awareness of class struggle among the members of the revolutionary committee and the revolutionary teachers and students of the entire school, and it opened their eyes.

Focusing on Revolutionary Criticism to Firmly Walk the Path of Political Construction of Schools

The great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "Politics is the commander, the soul." After the establishment of the school's revolutionary committee, the support-left personnel, guided by Chairman Mao's great thought of political construction of the army and Vice Chairman Lin's instructions on emphasizing proletarian politics, made emphasizing proletarian politics the most fundamental task of the newly born revolutionary committee.

With the help of the support-left personnel, the school's revolutionary committee closely integrated revolutionary criticism with every work task. When holding political work meetings, opposing anarchism, and organizing Mao Zedong Thought study classes, they combined the struggle situation and tasks, making the revolutionary criticism of the Chinese Khrushchev and a handful of capitalist-roaders within the party an important content throughout. The revolutionary teachers and students of the entire school, through their own experiences, exposed and criticized the heinous crimes of the Chinese Khrushchev and the biggest handful of capitalist-roaders within the party and their agents. They opposed emphasizing proletarian politics, promoted the revisionist educational line, and attempted to restore capitalism. Through the criticism, everyone increasingly recognized that the essence of the revisionist educational line was to oppose emphasizing proletarian politics and to oppose using Mao Zedong Thought to cultivate and train successors for the proletarian revolutionary cause. The newly born revolutionary committee could only raise high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and firmly walk the path of emphasizing proletarian politics to unite and lead the masses to achieve an overall victory in the proletarian cultural revolution.

Through revolutionary criticism, the school's revolutionary committee more consciously placed the active study and application of Mao Zedong Thought at the forefront of all work. They organized Mao Zedong Thought study classes, established political work systems, had Mao Zedong Thought study days, heart-to-heart talks, and struggle against selfishness and criticize revisionism meetings every week, and regularly held lectures on the active study and application of Mao Zedong Thought. The revolutionary committee also frequently studied measures to implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions, summarized and exchanged experiences of emphasizing proletarian politics, and insisted on having teachers go to the classes to criticize the revisionist educational line with the revolutionary youngsters and to study reform methods together.

Focusing on Revolutionary Criticism to Promote Thought Revolutionization

The great leader Chairman Mao says: "A school of one hundred people, if there is no leadership core of several or even a dozen of the most active, upright, and perceptive people formed in practice (not arbitrarily assembled) from among the teachers, staff, and students, then this school will definitely not be well-run." The support-left personnel, following Chairman Mao's great teachings, helped the revolutionary committee members to combine the criticism of revisionism with the struggle against selfishness. Through revolutionary criticism, they promoted the thought revolutionization of the revolutionary committee members.

The members of the school's revolutionary committee included revolutionary leading cadres who had just come forward, teachers, and revolutionary youngsters. At the beginning, some comrades, due to the incomplete elimination of bourgeois factionalism, sat together but did not unite in their efforts. Some were afraid of making mistakes and did not work boldly enough. The support-left personnel helped them to combine revolutionary criticism with criticism and self-criticism. They criticized the counter-revolutionary revisionist fallacies of the Chinese Khrushchev once, examined the "self" in their minds once, and launched an attack on the "self" once. The revolutionary committee members also used the method of inviting in and going out to broadly listen to the criticisms of the masses and to study Chairman Mao's works with the students, forming pairs of reds, always placing themselves under the supervision of the masses.

      狠批中国赫鲁晓夫修正主义教育路线
      沿着无产阶级政治建校道路奋勇前进
      解放军驻北京二十三中支左人员帮助校革命委员会坚决贯彻毛主席的“三·七”指示和一系列最新指示，狠抓阶级斗争，持续深入地开展革命大批判
    据新华社二十六日讯　人民解放军某部驻北京二十三中支左人员，坚决贯彻毛主席的“三·七”指示和一系列最新指示，帮助校革命委员会狠抓阶级斗争，持续深入地开展革命大批判，走突出无产阶级政治的道路。
    狠抓革命大批判，向阶级敌人发动持续的进攻
    二十三中革委会成立不久，解放军支左人员就帮助革委会成员认真学习毛主席关于阶级斗争的教导，并且通过摆本校阶级斗争的各种事实，提高大家的阶级斗争观念。大家结合自己的活思想，围绕怎样才能巩固新诞生的革命委员会的问题进行了讨论。大家认识到，无产阶级革命派在向党内一小撮走资派夺权的斗争中取得胜利以后，更要有力地领导无产阶级和广大革命群众向无产阶级革命的敌人进行斗争，无产阶级的革命政权才能巩固。
    认识提高后，革委会积极领导全校革命师生牢牢掌握斗争的大方向，深入开展革命大批判，狠批中国赫鲁晓夫等党内一小撮走资派复辟资本主义的滔天罪行。全校革命师生运用大字报、小字报、黑板报、广播，通过大会、小会，重点批判了中国赫鲁晓夫的“阶级斗争熄灭”论，揭发了本校一小撮阶级敌人不甘心自己的灭亡，企图翻案，挑动群众，制造事端，千方百计破坏革委会的权威，妄图颠覆新诞生的革命委员会等罪恶阴谋。革命大批判大大增强了革委会成员和全校革命师生的阶级斗争观念，擦亮了大家的眼睛。
      狠抓革命大批判，坚定地
          走政治建校的道路
    伟大领袖毛主席教导我们说：“政治是统帅，是灵魂。”校革委会成立后，支左人员就以毛主席政治建军的伟大思想和林副主席关于突出无产阶级政治的指示为指针，把突出无产阶级政治，作为新生的革委会最根本的任务。
    在支左人员的帮助下，校革委会把革命的大批判同每一项工作任务密切结合了起来。召开政治工作会议、反对无政府主义、举办毛泽东思想学习班，他们都结合斗争形势和任务，把对中国赫鲁晓夫等党内一小撮走资派的革命大批判作为重要内容，贯彻始终。全校革命师生以自己的切身体会，揭发批判了中国赫鲁晓夫等党内最大一小撮走资派及其代理人反对突出无产阶级政治，推行修正主义教育路线，妄图复辟资本主义的滔天罪行。在大批判中，大家越来越清楚地认识到，修正主义教育路线的要害，就是反对突出无产阶级政治，反对用毛泽东思想培养和造就无产阶级革命事业的接班人。新诞生的革命委员会只有高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，坚定地走突出无产阶级政治的道路，才能团结和带领广大群众，夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利。
    通过革命大批判，校革命委员会更加自觉地把活学活用毛泽东思想摆在一切工作的首位，大办毛泽东思想学习班，建立了政治工作制度，每周有毛泽东思想学习日、谈心会、斗私批修会，定期召开活学活用毛泽东思想讲用会。革委会还经常研究落实毛主席最新指示的措施，总结和交流突出无产阶级政治的经验，并且坚持让教员们下到班级，和革命小将一起批判修正主义教育路线，一起研究改革的办法。
  狠抓革命大批判　促进思想革命化
    伟大领袖毛主席说：“一个百人的学校，如果没有一个从教员中、职员中、学生中按照实际形成的（不是勉强凑集的）最积极最正派最机敏的几个人乃至十几个人的领导骨干，这个学校就一定办不好。”支左人员遵照毛主席的伟大教导，帮助革委会成员把批修和斗私结合起来，通过革命大批判，促进革委会成员的思想革命化。
    校革委会成员，有刚站出来的革命领导干部，有教员，有革命小将。开始，有的同志由于资产阶级派性没有完全肃清，人坐在一起，劲使不到一处，有的怕犯错误，工作不够大胆。支左人员就帮助他们结合革命大批判，开展批评和自我批评。他们批判一次中国赫鲁晓夫的反革命修正主义谬论，查一次自己头脑里的“私”字，向“私”字发动一次进攻。革委会成员还采用请进来、走出去的办法，广泛听取群众的批评意见，和同学们一起学习毛主席著作，结成一对红，始终把自己置于群众的监督之下。
