Our Hengyang Locomotive Depot, like all other places in the country, is experiencing a great situation. However, a handful of capitalist roaders within the Party and the ghosts and snakes in society, unwilling to accept their defeat, took advantage of the rampant anarchist trends in the previous period, stirring up trouble everywhere and attempting to sabotage railway transportation.

Seeing the trains stopped, passengers obstructed, and goods piled up, we were very anxious. At this moment, we remembered Chairman Mao's great call to "grasp revolution and promote production," and realized that smashing the enemy's plot to sabotage production and overcoming the influence of anarchist trends is a struggle to defend Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. We are red railway workers who have stood up under the leadership of Chairman Mao and grown up under the nurturing of Mao Zedong Thought. If we don't do it, who will? Thinking of this, our hearts burned with passion. We quickly organized a "Revolution and Production Crew Combat Group," filling in wherever there were shortages, and defending Chairman Mao's revolutionary line with practical actions.

Our actions immediately received the enthusiastic support of the PLA stationed at the locomotive depot and the broad revolutionary masses of workers. Old locomotive driver Deng Daguang, who had suffered deeply in the old society, firmly told us, "As long as it can strike a heavy blow against those class enemies who sabotage railway transportation, I firmly support you!" He joined the combat group, fearing neither hardship nor fatigue, often working while sick. Some young workers who were deeply influenced by anarchist trends, under the education and inspiration of revolutionary old workers, raised their consciousness and joined the combat group one after another.

The crew combat group, like an iron fist, struck at the vital points of the class enemy. On one hand, they spread rumors, and on the other, they took advantage of the situation to push difficult and heavy tasks onto the combat group, attempting to wear us down. The members of our combat group realized that the enemy wanted to destroy not only this combat group but also the revolutionary discipline of the proletariat, attempting to obstruct the implementation of the great policy of "grasp revolution and promote production," and sabotage the Cultural Revolution. Everyone expressed: For the sake of defending Chairman Mao and Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, we must persist to the end.

Our crew combat group gradually grew stronger in the struggle, and the entire depot saw a thriving new situation in revolution and production. However, some people tried to use sugar-coated bullets to attack us, luring a batch of new workers not to go to work and causing trouble over promotions and wage increases. The members of our crew combat group, with these problems in mind, studied Chairman Mao's teaching: "There may be some Communists who have never been defeated by enemies with guns; they are truly heroes in front of these enemies. However, they cannot withstand the attack of bullets coated with sugar; they will be defeated in front of sugar bullets. We must prevent this situation." The members of the crew combat group raised their awareness and expressed their determination not to be defeated by sugar bullets. We all made a resolution called "Three No Hands": "Do not ask the state for activity funds; do not ask for more protective supplies; do not ask for overtime pay." Because we go out on duty frequently, protective supplies are worn out quickly, so we wash and mend our worn-out work clothes, gloves, etc., for continued use; without funds to subscribe to newspapers and magazines, we bring our own newspapers and magazines for everyone to study together. Thus, the enemy's plot was once again foiled by us.

Recalling our crew combat group's struggle against the class enemy, which time was it not relying on the invincible Mao Zedong Thought and emphasizing proletarian politics? Every time we drive a train, every victory we achieve, it is the invincible Mao Zedong Thought that gives us boundless strength, boundless wisdom, and limitless courage. We regard pulling an extra ton of cargo, driving an extra train, and saving a shovel of coal as a powerful blow to the capitalist roaders and all class enemies, and as a contribution to the Cultural Revolution.

Now, more than 230 workers have joined the Revolution and Production Crew Combat Group. In the short period of over two months since its establishment, all members of the group, in addition to completing their own duties, have also taken over more than 100 shifts, ensuring that train after train runs on schedule. The railway transportation situation is getting better and better.

We are determined to hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and further launch a new high tide of "grasp revolution and promote production" and "thrift for revolution."

    一场保卫毛主席革命路线的斗争
    衡阳机务段工人　刘友志　唐生义　唐智珍　李洪发
    我们衡阳机务段同全国各地一样，也是形势大好。但是，党内一小撮走资派和社会上的牛鬼蛇神，不甘心他们的失败，在前一个时期，他们利用无政府主义思潮的泛滥，到处煽风点火，妄图破坏铁路运输。
    眼看着列车停开，旅客受阻，货物积压的现象，我们十分着急。这时候，我们想起了毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的伟大号召，意识到：粉碎阶级敌人破坏生产的阴谋，克服无政府主义思潮的影响，就是一场保卫毛主席革命路线的斗争。我们是在毛主席领导下翻身、在毛泽东思想哺育下成长的红色铁路工人。我们不干谁干？想到这里，我们心头热呼呼的。我们很快就组织了一个“抓革命、促生产乘务战斗组”，那里缺人往那里顶，用实际行动来捍卫毛主席的革命路线。
    我们的行动，马上得到了驻机务段的解放军和广大革命工人的热烈支持。在旧社会苦大仇深的老司机长邓达全坚定地对我们说：“只要能狠狠打击那些破坏铁路运输的阶级敌人，我坚决支持你们！”他参加了战斗组，不怕苦，不怕累，经常带病顶班工作。一些原来受无政府主义思潮影响较深的青年工人，在革命老工人的教育带动下，提高了觉悟，纷纷参加了战斗组。
    乘务战斗组象一只铁拳头，击中了阶级敌人的要害。他们一方面散布流言蜚语，又趁机把难活重活推给战斗组，妄图拖垮我们。我们战斗组的同志认识到，敌人要搞垮的不仅是这个战斗组，而是妄图搞垮无产阶级的革命纪律性，妄图阻挠“抓革命，促生产”伟大方针的贯彻执行，破坏无产阶级文化大革命。大家纷纷表示：为了保卫毛主席，保卫毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，我们一定要坚持到底。
    我们乘务战斗组在斗争中逐步壮大起来，全段的革命、生产出现了一片蓬勃的新气象。可是，有人企图用糖衣裹着的炮弹把我们攻垮，他们引诱一批新工人不上班，闹提级加薪。我们乘务战斗组的同志，带着这些问题，学习了毛主席这一教导：“可能有这样一些共产党人，他们是不曾被拿枪的敌人征服过的，他们在这些敌人面前不愧英雄的称号；但是经不起人们用糖衣裹着的炮弹的攻击，他们在糖弹面前要打败仗。我们必须预防这种情况。”乘务战斗组的全体同志提高了认识，纷纷表示，决不在糖弹面前打败仗。我们大伙儿还作出一条决议，名叫三不伸手：“不伸手向国家要活动经费；不伸手多领防护用品；不伸手要加班工资”。因为出班的次数多，防护用品损耗大，我们就将磨坏了的工作服、手套等洗干净，缝补使用；没有经费订阅报刊、杂志，就将自己的报纸、杂志拿来大家一块学习。就这样，阶级敌人的阴谋又一次被我们粉碎了。
    回忆我们乘务战斗组在和阶级敌人作斗争时，哪一次不是靠战无不胜的毛泽东思想、靠突出无产阶级政治？我们每开一趟车，每取得一个胜利，都是战无不胜的毛泽东思想给了我们无穷的力量，无穷的智慧，无限的勇气。我们把多拉一吨货，多开一趟车，多省一锹煤，都看作是对走资派和一切阶级敌人的有力打击，都是对无产阶级文化大革命作出的贡献。
    现在，已经有二百三十多名职工，参加了抓革命、促生产乘务战斗组。从成立到现在的短短两个多月的时间里，全组同志除完成本身的出乘任务外，还先后顶班一百多趟，保证一列列火车正常开出。铁路运输形势越来越好。
    我们决心更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，进一步掀起“抓革命，促生产”和“节约闹革命”的新高潮。
