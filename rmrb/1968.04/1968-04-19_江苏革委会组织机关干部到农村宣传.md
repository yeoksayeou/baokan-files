The Jiangsu Revolutionary Committee recently organized more than 400 cadres from provincial-level organs to form seven Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams. They went to the countryside to propagate the great leader Chairman Mao's great line of "grasp revolution, promote production," and to promote the development of spring farming. The Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams going to the countryside will work and study with the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants, vigorously propagate Mao Zedong Thought, firmly grasp class struggle, and launch a fierce offensive against class enemies.
