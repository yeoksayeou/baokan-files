The poisonous weed "Red River Waves" reflects the main theme of glorifying the anti-party leader Gao Gang. It also spreads the reactionary point of view of the so-called "Shanbei Saves the Central Committee." The creators of the film brazenly tamper with history, distort right and wrong, and through the malicious method of excessively elevating the status and role of the Shaan-Gan base area, they elevate the political status of the Gao Gang anti-party clique, and in a heartless and mad way, they denigrate the glorious image of the great leader of the Chinese and world people, our most red red sun Mao Zedong, and denigrate the great role of the Jinggangshan revolutionary base area. They attempt to portray Gao Gang as the natural representative of the party's correct line and the "savior" of the people of the northwest, and want "future generations to see how their ancestors fought for the country," thereby creating public opinion for their usurpation of the party, the army, and the government, and the restoration of capitalism.

The scriptwriters blatantly shouted at a discussion meeting: "To express the party's establishment of the base area, the policy of surrounding the cities with the countryside has achieved victories, almost a history of struggle of the Southern Liang government" (Note: The party they want to express is the party controlled by Gao Gang. The Southern Liang government they propose is the leadership organ of the Shaan-Gan base area controlled by the Gao Gang anti-party clique). They also said: "The role of this base area is great," and at that time, "there was only this one base area in the country," so "only the consolidation and expansion of the Shaan-Gan border area, therefore, the Central Red Army's northward advance had a foothold." The implication is that Gao Gang, who controlled and occupied the Shaan-Gan base area, saved the Central Committee and the Central Red Army.

In order to strengthen this reactionary theme, they disregard historical facts and move events after 1935 to before October 1935. For example, the actual time of the "Temple Robbery" was 1936; the capture of Yongle Town was also after 1935. These are all victories achieved by the people of Shaan-Gan under the personal leadership of Chairman Mao. But they brazenly use these to glorify the traitor Gao Gang and maliciously propagate that the Gao Gang anti-party clique swept away the enemy's strongholds in front, "clearing the way for the northward advance of the anti-Japanese Red Army!" The script also specially fabricated such a scene: after Yongle Town was captured, Zhang Tiewa's group hoisted a "waving red flag" on the city wall. They stood proudly under the red flag. Following that, "countless red flags overlapped." It turned out that "the Central Red Army led by Chairman Mao arrived at the Shaan-Gan border revolutionary base area after the Long March," and thus "the Central Red Army and the Northwest Red Army met." This carefully designed scene with strong suggestive power clearly exposed the wolfish ambitions of the Gao Gang anti-party clique. Later, they became nervous and secretly removed this scene when the script was published. But the basic idea of the script has not been removed.

They use many fabricated plots and events in this way to maliciously try to prove that the Shaan-Gan base area's smashing of the enemy's "encirclement and suppression," the development of revolutionary armed forces, the consolidation and expansion of the base area, are all the results of the Gao Gang anti-party clique implementing its own political line, military line, and organizational line, and are the "merits" of the Gao Gang anti-party clique. They attempt to prove that these are achievements made without the leadership of Chairman Mao and the Central Committee of the Party headed by Mao Zedong, and to prove that the Shaan-Gan base area is the best and the only one that can be preserved in the country, and has "cleared the way" for Chairman Mao and the Central Committee to go north and provided a "foothold."

Is the truth of history like this? No! This is a big lie. Countless iron-clad historical facts prove: all our achievements and victories are achieved under the leadership of Chairman Mao, and are the victories of Mao Zedong Thought.

It is our great teacher Chairman Mao who, for decades, commanded the vast revolutionary army to pursue the fleeing enemy, subdue the dragon, conquer evil, and plan great strategies, guiding the ship of the Chinese revolution to break through rapids, navigate around reefs, and sail against the wind and waves to victory. Every victory of the Chinese revolution is achieved under the leadership of Chairman Mao and is a great victory of the invincible Mao Zedong Thought. It is Chairman Mao who first ignited the revolutionary fire on Jinggangshan. Through arduous struggles, he not only solved the problem of the development path of the Chinese revolution in practice but also in theory, opening up the victorious path of surrounding the cities with the countryside and finally seizing the cities. Chairman Mao also formulated a series of correct policies and strategies for the political construction of rural revolutionary base areas, land revolution, and armed struggle in practice. All rural revolutionary base areas and armed struggles in various places that correctly implemented Chairman Mao's revolutionary line and policies achieved victories and development; otherwise, they suffered setbacks and failures.

In July 1935, the Chiang Kai-shek bandits launched the third "encirclement and suppression" against the Shaan-Gan border revolutionary base area. At that time, the party organization in Shaanbei was under the control of the "Left" opportunist line of Wang Ming, causing the Shaan-Gan base area to be in a very dangerous situation in terms of politics, military, and organization. In October of the same year, the Central Red Army led by our great commander-in-chief Chairman Mao arrived in Shaanbei, and under the personal leadership of Chairman Mao, the Central Red Army, together with the Red Fifteenth Army Corps, annihilated the Chiang bandits' 109th Division in Zhi Luo Town, southwest of Fenyang County, and thoroughly smashed the Chiang bandits' "encirclement and suppression" of the Shaan-Gan border area. As our great leader Chairman Mao said in the article "On the Tactics Against Japanese Imperialism" in December 1935: "With the completion of the Long March, a new situation begins. The battle of Zhi Luo Town, the brotherly unity of the Central Red Army and the Northwest Red Army, smashed the traitor Chiang Kai-shek's 'encirclement and suppression' of the Shaan-Gan border area, and held a groundbreaking ceremony for the task of placing the national revolutionary base in the northwest by the Party Central Committee." It was also under the direct leadership of Chairman Mao that the "Left" erroneous line was thoroughly corrected, the crisis of the Shaan-Gan base area was saved, and this revolutionary base area was continuously consolidated and developed into the national revolutionary base. This is the true history.

It is our great leader Chairman Mao who saved China and also saved Shaanbei. The remnants of the Gao Gang anti-party clique want to tamper with history, distort right and wrong, usurp the merits of heaven, and claim them for themselves, and brazenly attribute all the historical merits of our great leader Chairman Mao and the proletarian headquarters headed by Chairman Mao to the anti-party element Gao Gang. This conspiracy will never succeed!

Let the reactionary fallacy of "Shanbei Saves the Central Committee" and all anti-party conspirators go to hell!

    高岗死党余孽颠倒历史的阴谋必须揭穿
    甘肃兰州　立新功
    大毒草《红河激浪》所体现的主题思想，除了极力美化反党头目高岗之外，还极力散布所谓“陕北救中央”这一反动论点。影片炮制者肆意篡改历史，颠倒黑白，通过无限抬高陕甘根据地的地位和作用的恶毒手法，抬高高岗反党集团的政治身价，丧心病狂地贬低中国和世界人民的伟大领袖、我们心中最红最红的红太阳毛主席的光辉形象，贬低井冈山革命根据地的伟大作用。他们妄图把高岗打扮成党的正确路线的当然代表和西北人民的“救星”，而且要让“子孙后代看他们的先辈是怎么打天下的”，以此来为他们篡党、篡军、篡政，复辟资本主义制造舆论。
    剧本的炮制者在一次讨论会上露骨地叫嚣：要“表现党创立根据地，以农村包围城市这种政策所取得的胜利，几乎是南梁政府的一番斗争史”（按：他们要表现的党是指高岗所把持的党，他们提出的南梁政府，就是指高岗反党集团所把持的陕甘根据地的领导机关）又说：这个根据地“作用是大的”，全国“当时只有这一个根据地了”，所以“只有陕甘边区的巩固与扩大，因此中央红军北上才有了落脚点”。言下之意就是：高岗把持和盘踞的陕甘根据地救了党中央、救了中央红军。
    为了加强这个反动主题思想，他们不顾历史事实，把一九三五年以后的事，也提前到一九三五年十月以前来写。如“劫庙”的真实时间本来是一九三六年；打下永乐镇本来也是在一九三五年以后，这都是陕甘人民在毛主席亲自领导下所取得的胜利。但他们却公然以此来美化叛徒高岗，并恶毒地宣扬高岗反党集团扫荡前边敌人的据点，“为北上抗日的红军扫清前进的道路”！剧本还特地虚构了这样一个场面：永乐镇打下之后，张铁娃的一伙人在城头插上了“迎风招展”的红旗，他们雄赳赳、气昂昂地站在红旗下。接着是“随着迎风招展的红旗，无数面红旗迭印出来”。原来这是“毛主席领导的中央红军，长征到达陕甘边区革命根据地”，于是“中央红军和西北红军会师了”。这一精心设计的极富暗示力的画面，再明显不过地暴露了高岗反党集团的狼子野心。后来，他们作贼心虚，剧本发表时将这一场面偷偷地抹掉了。但是剧本的基本思想并没有抹掉。
    他们就是这样地通过许多伪造的情节、事件，丧心病狂地力图证明，陕甘根据地粉碎敌人的“围剿”，革命武装力量的发展，根据地的巩固和扩大，都是高岗反党集团实行自己制定的政治路线、军事路线和组织路线的结果，是高岗反党集团的“功劳”。力图证明这是在没有毛主席和以毛主席为首的党中央英明领导下取得的成绩，力图证明陕甘根据地是全国最好的，也是唯一能保存下来的根据地，并为毛主席和党中央北上“扫清”了“前进的道路”，提供了“落脚点”。
    难道历史的真相是这样吗？呸！这是弥天大谎。无数铁的历史事实证明：我们的一切成就，一切胜利，都是在毛主席的英明领导下取得的，都是毛泽东思想的胜利。
    是我们的伟大导师毛主席，几十年来统帅亿万浩浩荡荡的革命大军，追穷寇，缚苍龙，征腐恶，起宏图，指引中国革命的航船，冲过激流，绕过暗礁，乘风破浪，胜利前进。中国革命的每一个胜利，都是在毛主席的英明领导下取得的，都是战无不胜的毛泽东思想的伟大胜利。是毛主席第一个点燃了井冈山革命烈火，经过艰苦的斗争，不仅在实践上，而且在理论上完满地解决了中国革命发展道路的问题，开辟了由农村包围城市，最后夺取城市的胜利航道。毛主席还在实践中为农村革命根据地的政权建设、土地革命、武装斗争等制定了一系列正确的政策和策略。全国各地的农村革命根据地和武装斗争，凡是正确地执行了毛主席的革命路线和政策者，就得到胜利和发展；反之，便遭到挫折和失败。
    一九三五年七月，蒋介石匪帮对陕甘边区革命根据地发动了第三次“围剿”。当时陕北的党组织在王明“左”倾机会主义路线控制下，从政治、军事、组织各方面造成了陕甘根据地岌岌可危的严重局面。同年十月，由我们伟大统帅毛主席率领的中央红军到达陕北后，并且在毛主席的亲自领导下，中央红军与红十五军团一起，在鄜县西南的直罗镇，全歼蒋匪一○九师，彻底粉碎了蒋匪帮对陕甘边区的“围剿”。正如我们伟大领袖毛主席一九三五年十二月在《论反对日本帝国主义的策略》一文中所说的：“长征一完结，新局面就开始。直罗镇一仗，中央红军同西北红军兄弟般的团结，粉碎了卖国贼蒋介石向着陕甘边区的‘围剿’，给党中央把全国革命大本营放在西北的任务，举行了一个奠基礼”。也正是在毛主席的直接领导下，彻底纠正了“左”倾错误路线，挽救了陕甘根据地的危机，使这个革命根据地不断巩固和发展，成为全国革命的大本营。这就是历史的真实。
    是我们伟大的领袖毛主席拯救了中国，也拯救了陕北。高岗反党集团的死党余孽们，妄想篡改历史，颠倒黑白，贪天之功，占为己有，公然把我们伟大领袖毛主席和以毛主席为首的无产阶级司令部的历史功绩统统记在反党分子高岗名下。这阴谋永远不会得逞！
    让“陕北救中央”的反动谬论和一切反党阴谋家统统见鬼去吧！
