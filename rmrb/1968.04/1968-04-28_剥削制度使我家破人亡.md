Title: The Exploitation System Led to the Ruin of My Family

The Chinese Khrushchev is an agent of the bourgeoisie, always defending the interests of the bourgeoisie. To legalize the bourgeoisie's exploitation of workers and allow "capitalists to exist and develop," he slanders our working class as willing to be exploited and oppressed by capitalists, claiming that "a bit of exploitation means we have food to eat, and our wives and children can survive." This is pure and simple traitorous talk, a complete exposure of his traitorous face. I was so angry when I heard this that my teeth ached.

We old miners have personally experienced that exploitation does not give us "food to eat"; it only makes us go hungry and naked, leading to the ruin of our families. My hometown is in Hebei, Handan. Because my family was exploited by the landlord class to the point of being unable to live, I came to the Dingtang Coal Mine at the age of fifteen. The world is the same everywhere; escaping from the gates of hell only to enter the gates of the underworld, the poor are exploited wherever they go. At that time, workers said, "If you have half a bowl of gruel at home, don't come to Dingtang." To find a mouthful of food, we had to jump into the fire pit. In the coal mines, we were brutally exploited by imperialists, capitalists, and feudal foremen. I worked sixteen hours a day and still went hungry. At that time, we ate mixed flour, which was made from moldy grain mixed together from the bottom of the warehouse, containing dirt, sand, short hair, and grass. We ate it like medicine, swallowing it without water, and after eating, we had a mouth full of sand. After eating this, we drank some foul coal water, and the workers had diarrhea all day. Even this little mixed flour required working two shifts a day to get a bit of it, making people look emaciated, sweat all over while working, see stars, and some couldn't move in the pit. When they were carried up, they were dragged out by the capitalists to be fed to dogs. At that time, the riverbank in front of the Dingtang Coal Mine for several miles was littered with the corpses of our class brothers, and everywhere were the bones of our class brothers left by the dogs. This is the "merit" of capitalist exploitation.

Not long after I came to the Dingtang Coal Mine, my hometown suffered a natural disaster. My father, along with my grandfather, mother, and two younger brothers, couldn't live at home, so they came to find me. I couldn't even feed myself, let alone five more people! To survive, I sometimes worked several shifts in a row without going up the pit, but still couldn't support the whole family. Soon, my grandfather and mother starved to death. My sister, along with her child, came to see my mother and was also starved to death. In less than a few months, the evil exploitation system took the lives of four of my family members. There were many cases like mine in Dingtang. We must ask the Chinese Khrushchev, which worker is willing to be exploited? Which worker has food to eat because of exploitation? Those who like exploitation are the capitalists and you, the big traitor, Chinese Khrushchev. The capitalists have eaten the flesh of the working class, drunk our blood, and ground our bones into powder, still trying to squeeze out a few drops of oil from the bone fragments. We have no rice to cook, no clothes to wear, but they are fat and well-fed, with oil dripping from their faces. The Chinese Khrushchev is our sworn enemy.

After liberation, Chairman Mao saved us, who were once called "stinky coal blackies," from the "mass graves" and overthrew the exploiting classes, making us masters of the country. Only then did we have food to eat and clothes to wear. The enemy is not happy about our happy life; they are still alive but their hearts are not dead, always missing their lost "paradise." The Chinese Khrushchev hurriedly came out shouting "exploitation is glorious," calling for the souls of the bourgeoisie, attempting to restore capitalism in China, and making us return to the old path of exploitation and oppression in the old China. We will never agree to this.

Great Leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is, in essence, a great political revolution carried out by the proletariat against the bourgeoisie and all exploiting classes in the conditions of socialism, a continuation of the long-term struggle between the Chinese Communist Party and its leadership of the broad revolutionary masses and the Kuomintang reactionaries, and a continuation of the class struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie." We must never forget class struggle, carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end, expose all hidden spies, traitors, stubborn capitalist-roaders, and unrepentant landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists, and thoroughly defeat these villains, along with their chief representative, the Chinese Khrushchev. We must firmly hold the reins of the proletariat, defend our red power, and ensure it never changes color.

    剥削制度使我家破人亡
    门头沟煤矿老矿工　辛庚朝
    中国赫鲁晓夫是资产阶级的代理人，他时时处处都在维护资产阶级的利益。他为了使资产阶级剥削工人合法化，让“资本家存在和发展”，竟诬蔑我们工人阶级愿意受资本家的剥削和压迫，胡说什么：“剥削一下我就有饭吃，老婆孩子就能活下去。”这是地地道道的工贼黑话，是他工贼嘴脸的大暴露。我一听这话就气得牙根疼。
    我们老矿工亲身体会到：剥削并不能使我们“有饭吃”，只能使我们没吃没穿，家破人亡。我的老家在河北邯郸，由于家里被地主阶级剥削得过不下去了，十几岁上我就来到了门头沟煤矿。天下乌鸦一般黑，逃出了鬼门关又钻进了阎王殿，穷人走到哪也是受剥削。当时工人们说：“家有半碗粥，不到门头沟”，为了找口饭吃，明知是火坑也得往里跳。在煤窑受帝国主义、资本家、封建把头的残酷剥削，我一天干十六个小时的活，得到的仍是饿肚子。那时，我们吃的是混合面，这是用仓库底下霉烂的粮食混合在一起做成的，里面有泥有土，还有短头发、草屑。我们象吃药一样，不用水冲就咽不下去，吃完了留下满嘴沙子。吃了这些东西再喝一些臭煤水，工人们整天拉肚子。就是这点混合面也一天要干两班才得到一点，把人吃得面黄肌瘦，干活时浑身出虚汗，两眼发黑，有的躺在井里不能动弹，抬上来就被资本家拉出喂狗了。那时门头沟煤矿门前几里长的河滩上到处躺着阶级弟兄的尸体，到处是被狗吃剩下的阶级弟兄的骨头。这就是资本家剥削的“功劳”。
    我来到门头沟煤矿不久，我的家乡闹了天灾，父亲领着爷爷、母亲和两个弟弟在家活不下去了，也找我来了。我一个人都吃不饱，这回多了五口人怎么过呀！为了活命，我有时连干几个班也不升井，还是维持不了全家吃的，没多久，我的爷爷和母亲就活活地饿死了。我的妹妹带孩子来看我母亲，也连累带饿死去了。不到几个月的时间，万恶的剥削制度夺去了我四个亲人的性命。在门头沟象我这种情况多得很。我们要质问中国赫鲁晓夫，哪个工人愿意受剥削？哪个工人受剥削有饭吃？喜欢剥削的人有，这就是资本家和中国赫鲁晓夫你这个大工贼。资本家吃了我们工人阶级的肉，喝了我们的血，嚼碎了我们的骨头，在我们的骨头渣子里还要榨出二两油。我们没米下锅，没衣遮体，他们却吃得肥头大耳，满脸流油。中国赫鲁晓夫是我们不共戴天的仇敌。
    解放后，毛主席把我们这些过去被人叫做“臭煤黑子”的人从“万人坑”中救了出来，推翻了剥削阶级，成了国家的主人，我们才有了吃有了穿。对我们的幸福生活，敌人打心眼里不舒服，他们人还在，心不死，念念不忘他们失去的“天堂”。中国赫鲁晓夫急急忙忙跳出来大喊“剥削有功”、“剥削光荣”，就是为资产阶级叫魂，妄图在中国复辟资本主义，就是叫我们重新回到旧中国受剥削、受压迫的老路上去，我们坚决不答应。
    伟大领袖毛主席教导我们说：“无产阶级文化大革命，实质上是在社会主义条件下，无产阶级反对资产阶级和一切剥削阶级的政治大革命，是中国共产党及其领导下的广大革命人民群众和国民党反动派长期斗争的继续，是无产阶级和资产阶级阶级斗争的继续。”我们一定念念不忘阶级斗争，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底，揪出一切隐藏的特务、叛徒、顽固不化的走资派和未改造好的地、富、反、坏、右分子，把这些坏蛋，连同他们的总代表中国的赫鲁晓夫彻底打倒。我们一定要牢牢掌握好无产阶级的印把子，保卫我们红色的政权，使她永不变色。
