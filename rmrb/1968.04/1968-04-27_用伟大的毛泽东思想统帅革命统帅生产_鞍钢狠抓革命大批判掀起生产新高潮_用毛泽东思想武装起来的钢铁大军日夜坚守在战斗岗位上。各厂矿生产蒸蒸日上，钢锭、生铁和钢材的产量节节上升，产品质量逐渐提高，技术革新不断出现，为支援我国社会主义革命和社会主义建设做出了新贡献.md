Anshan Iron and Steel Company's revolutionary workers, after more than a year of tempering through the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, have achieved unprecedented heights in proletarian political consciousness and a completely new appearance. They follow Chairman Mao's great directive of "grasp revolution, promote production," vigorously grasp revolution, and vigorously promote production, launching a magnificent new production surge.

Now, in the vast plant area of Anshan Iron and Steel Company, the iron and steel army armed with Mao Zedong Thought is guarding their battle stations day and night. Production in various factories and mines is thriving, with the output of steel ingots, pig iron, and steel products continuously increasing. Product quality is gradually improving, and technological innovations are constantly emerging. Since March, various steelmaking plants, ironmaking plants, seamless steel tube plants, large rolling mills, small rolling mills, and welded pipe product plants have all created new production records since their inception, making new contributions to support China's socialist revolution and socialist construction.

The new production surge currently underway at Anshan Iron and Steel Company has a distinctive feature: under the leadership of various levels of revolutionary committees, the broad revolutionary workers firmly and unshakably emphasize proletarian politics, firmly establish Mao Zedong Thought, and use Mao Zedong Thought to guide revolution, production, and all work in factories and enterprises. They consciously place the study and application of Chairman Mao's works in a position higher than everything, greater than everything, earlier than everything, and heavier than everything. Over the past few months, the entire company has held more than 1,700 sessions of various types of Mao Zedong Thought study classes, with over 150,000 participants. In the process of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, the broad revolutionary workers, in conjunction with the class struggle in their units, have conducted in-depth and sustained revolutionary criticism and denunciation, thoroughly exposing the crimes of the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents in Anshan who attempted to restore capitalism and implement the bourgeois line of managing enterprises. They have also exposed the crimes of the enemies of the proletarian revolution who attempted to sabotage production. Through the struggle and practice of recent periods, the broad revolutionary workers have further realized that only by vigorously grasping class struggle and conducting in-depth and sustained revolutionary criticism and denunciation can they raise the class struggle and line struggle consciousness of the broad revolutionary workers, better implement Chairman Mao's great policy of "grasp revolution, promote production," and achieve double victories in revolution and production. Currently, revolutionary criticism and denunciation are further developing in various factories and mines of Anshan Iron and Steel Company, from the thunderous mines to the towering blast furnaces, from the steel-splashing open hearth furnaces to the machine-roaring rolling mills, revolutionary workers are setting up revolutionary criticism and denunciation battlefields everywhere, and the flames of revolutionary criticism and denunciation are burning more fiercely.

After using Mao Zedong Thought to guide revolution and production, the broad revolutionary workers regard whether they can implement Chairman Mao's great policy of "grasp revolution, promote production" as an important sign of whether the working class is loyal to Chairman Mao, loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, and loyal to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. They are both revolutionary pioneers and production models. In the surging production wave of mutual pursuit and surpassing, the workers of the No. 9 open hearth furnace in the First Steel Plant have taken the lead with a great revolutionary spirit. After creating a new record of producing three furnaces of steel per day in early March, they recently achieved a new record of producing four furnaces of steel per day. This is a rare achievement for large open hearth furnaces since the Great Leap Forward, with the smelting time reduced by one-quarter. The other two sister steel plants heard the news and immediately came to learn. They gathered in front of the open hearth furnace, first studied Chairman Mao's instructions together, reviewed Chairman Mao's directive of "grasp revolution, promote production," and then learned from the comrades of the No. 9 open hearth furnace about the good experience of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works while bringing class struggle and production struggle issues. After learning from the experience of the No. 9 open hearth furnace in the First Steel Plant, the workers of the No. 18 open hearth furnace in the Second Steel Plant used Mao Zedong Thought to guide steelmaking. They made a great effort and surpassed the new record created by the No. 9 open hearth furnace in the First Steel Plant. Subsequently, the workers of the First Steel Plant learned from Chairman Mao's teaching of "modesty leads to progress, arrogance leads to decline," overcame the idea of "reaching the peak of the mountain and the edge of the river," and created an even newer record on the 19th, with the smelting time significantly reduced from the previous highest record.

The heated competition among the three steel plants has inspired the broad workers in the rolling, mechanical, transportation, and power systems. The entire company quickly launched a mass movement of learning from and catching up with the steel plants. The plate rolling mill and the second roughing mill recently accepted a new order. This task was urgent and had high quality standards. The mechanical repair plant, electrical repair plant, oxygen plant, and gas plant, upon hearing the news, actively organized manpower to participate in the battle. Everyone worked together, combining their efforts, and finally completed the task ahead of schedule with guaranteed quality.

In the new surge of grasping revolution and promoting production, the broad workers of Anshan Iron and Steel Company have displayed a daring spirit. Many old and difficult problems that were previously considered unsolvable have been solved, many technical bottlenecks that were previously considered insurmountable have been broken through, and many technical peaks that were previously considered unreachable have been conquered. Previously, many smelting plants in Anshan used large steel ladles and iron ladles worth tens of thousands of yuan, which had short service lives. This problem had long been regarded as a "sacred cow" by those bourgeois technical "authorities" and was untouchable. At the beginning of this year, the broad revolutionary workers of the Second Steel Plant, following the great leader Chairman Mao's teaching of "the Chinese people have the spirit, have the ability, and will definitely catch up with and surpass the world's advanced level in the not-too-distant future," voluntarily formed a team of more than ten trades, consisting of revolutionary cadres, workers, and technical personnel, to break through one technical bottleneck after another. They finally created a new set of processes and equipment, overcoming this major technical difficulty, allowing a large number of discarded steel ladles and iron ladles to be reused, and opening up a new path for increased production and savings. Recently, Anshan Iron and Steel Company held a meeting with more than 30,000 people to commend more than 60 advanced collectives and a large number of advanced individuals who emerged during the new production surge. The broad workers expressed their determination to hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, closely follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, fully implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions, vigorously emphasize proletarian politics, vigorously grasp revolution, and vigorously promote production, to achieve double victories in revolution and production.

    用伟大的毛泽东思想统帅革命统帅生产
    鞍钢狠抓革命大批判掀起生产新高潮
    用毛泽东思想武装起来的钢铁大军日夜坚守在战斗岗位上。各厂矿生产蒸蒸日上，钢锭、生铁和钢材的产量节节上升，产品质量逐渐提高，技术革新不断出现，为支援我国社会主义革命和社会主义建设做出了新贡献
    新华社鞍山二十六日电　鞍山钢铁公司广大革命职工，经过一年多来无产阶级文化大革命的战斗洗礼，无产阶级政治觉悟空前提高，精神面貌焕然一新，他们遵照毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的伟大教导，狠抓革命，猛促生产，掀起了轰轰烈烈的生产新高潮。
    现在，在鞍钢广阔的厂区里，用毛泽东思想武装起来的钢铁大军，日夜坚守在战斗岗位上。各厂矿的生产蒸蒸日上，钢锭、生铁和钢材的产量节节上升，产品质量逐渐提高，技术革新不断出现。进入三月份以来，各炼钢厂、炼铁厂、无缝钢管厂、大型轧钢厂、小型轧钢厂和焊管制品厂都创造了开工以来少有的生产新纪录，为支援我国社会主义革命和社会主义建设做出了新的贡献。
    鞍钢目前掀起的生产新高潮，最大的特点是，广大革命职工在各级革命委员会的领导下，坚定不移地大力突出无产阶级政治，大立毛泽东思想，用毛泽东思想统帅革命，统帅生产，统帅工厂企业中的一切工作。他们自觉地把活学活用毛主席著作放在高于一切，大于一切，先于一切，重于一切的地位。几个月来，全公司共举办了一千七百多期各种类型的毛泽东思想学习班，有十五万多人次参加了学习。广大革命职工在活学活用毛主席著作的过程中，结合本单位阶级斗争的实际，深入持久地开展革命大批判，大揭大批中国赫鲁晓夫及其在鞍钢的代理人妄图复辟资本主义，在鞍钢推行资产阶级办企业路线的罪行，彻底揭露无产阶级革命的敌人妄图破坏生产的罪行。广大革命职工从最近一个时期的斗争实践中进一步认识到，只有狠抓阶级斗争，深入持久地开展革命大批判，提高广大革命职工的阶级斗争和路线斗争觉悟，才能更好地贯彻毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的伟大方针，夺取革命、生产双胜利。现在，鞍钢各个厂矿的革命大批判正在进一步开展起来，从炮声隆隆的矿山到巍峨矗立的高炉，从钢花飞溅的平炉到机器轰鸣的轧钢机旁，革命职工到处大摆革命大批判的战场，革命大批判的烈火正越烧越旺。
    用毛泽东思想统帅革命，统帅生产以后，广大革命职工把能不能贯彻执行毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的伟大方针，看作是工人阶级忠不忠于毛主席，忠不忠于毛泽东思想，忠不忠于毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的一个重要标志。他们既当革命的闯将，又当生产的模范。在你追我赶的生产高潮中，第一炼钢厂九号平炉的职工以大无畏的革命精神跑在最前面，他们在三月上旬创造了日产三炉钢的新纪录之后，最近又实现了日出四炉钢的新纪录，这是大跃进以来大型平炉少有的新成绩，熔炼时间比平常缩短了四分之一。其他两个兄弟钢厂闻讯以后，立刻赶来学习。他们汇集到平炉前，首先一起学习毛主席的指示，重温毛主席
  “抓革命，促生产”的教导，然后向九号平炉的同志学习了带着阶级斗争和生产斗争中的问题活学活用毛主席著作的好经验。第二炼钢厂十八号平炉职工学习第一炼钢厂九号平炉的经验以后，用毛泽东思想统帅生产，指导炼钢。他们一鼓作气就刷新了第一炼钢厂九号平炉创造的新纪录。接着，第一炼钢厂职工学习了毛主席“虚心使人进步，骄傲使人落后”的教导，克服了“山到尖，河到边”的思想，又在十九日创造出更新的纪录，熔炼时间又比原来的最高纪录有了显著的缩短。
    三个炼钢厂热火朝天的竞赛活动，带动了轧钢、机械、运输和动力等系统的广大职工，全公司很快掀起了学钢厂、赶钢厂的群众性比学赶帮的热潮。轧板厂和第二初轧厂最近接受一项新的订货任务。这项任务要求急，质量标准高。机修总厂、电修厂、氧气厂和燃气厂等单位知道后，主动组织人力参加会战。大家齐心协力，拧成一个劲，终于保质保量地提前完成了任务。
    在抓革命、促生产的新高潮中，鞍钢广大职工发扬了敢想敢干的革命精神。许多过去被认为解决不了的老大难问题解决了，许多过去突不破的技术难关突破了，许多过去攀不上的技术高峰攀上去了。过去，鞍钢许多冶炼厂使用的价值达数万元的大型钢水缶和铁水缶，使用寿命不长。这个问题，长期以来被那些资产阶级技术“权威”看成是“佛爷眼珠”，动不得。今年年初，第二炼钢厂广大革命职工遵循伟大领袖毛主席“中国人民有志气，有能力，一定要在不远的将来，赶上和超过世界先进水平”的教导，自动组成一支有十几个工种参加的，革命干部、工人、技术人员三结合的革新小组，突破一个又一个技术难关，终于创造出一套新的工艺和设备，攻破了这个重大技术关键，使大量遗弃的钢水缶和铁水缶可以复活使用了，为增产节约开辟了一条新途径。最近，鞍钢举行了三万多人的大会，表彰了六十多个在生产新高潮中涌现出来的先进集体和一大批先进个人。广大职工表示，决心更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，全面落实毛主席的最新指示，大力突出无产阶级政治，狠抓革命，猛促生产，夺取革命和生产的双胜利。
