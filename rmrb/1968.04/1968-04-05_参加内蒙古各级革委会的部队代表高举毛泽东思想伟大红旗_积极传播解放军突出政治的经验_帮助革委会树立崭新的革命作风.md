Military representatives in various levels of revolutionary committees in Inner Mongolia are holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought. They are actively spreading the experiences of the People's Liberation Army in emphasizing politics, helping the revolutionary committees to establish a new revolutionary style.

A Xinhua News Agency report from Hohhot says: Military representatives in various levels of revolutionary committees in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region are holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought. They are actively spreading the experiences of the People's Liberation Army in emphasizing politics, helping the revolutionary committees to establish a new revolutionary style.

After the establishment of various levels of revolutionary committees in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, what should be the main focus in the midst of numerous tasks? Military representatives in various revolutionary committees believe that the most fundamental issue is to use Mao Zedong Thought as the guiding principle, emphasize proletarian politics, and carry out the ideological revolution of the people. This is a crucial matter that determines whether the newly born revolutionary committees can be consolidated and whether the Cultural Revolution can achieve comprehensive victory. Under this guiding ideology, they, together with other members of the revolutionary committees, seriously study the great leader Chairman Mao's teachings on political and ideological work and Vice Chairman Lin Biao's instructions on studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, emphasizing proletarian politics. They introduce the experiences of the army's political and ideological work to other members of the revolutionary committees. Many military representatives in factories, mines, and enterprises' revolutionary committees also help the revolutionary committees' revolutionary cadres and revolutionary masses' representatives to further understand the great significance of emphasizing proletarian politics through revolutionary criticism. Some units' leading members fear criticism from the masses for not being responsible in their work, so they are always busy with specific tasks, neglecting ideological and political work. Military representatives introduce the army's experiences in correctly handling the relationship between political work and other work to them, helping them to break away from personal interests and establish public interests, making them realize that after the establishment of the revolutionary committees, if proletarian politics are not emphasized, Chairman Mao's latest instructions are not implemented, class struggle is not carried out, then all efforts are in vain, and all busyness is meaningless, which would lead to a reversal of the situation.

How can Mao Zedong Thought be used as the guiding principle and proletarian politics be emphasized? Military representatives in various levels of revolutionary committees in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region believe that it is necessary to insist on the Four Firsts and focus on active thoughts. They say that the leading members of the revolutionary committees, by insisting on the Four Firsts and focusing on active thoughts, can know what the masses are doing and thinking, can understand the new trends, new problems, and new experiences in implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions, and can work with confidence and many methods. Many revolutionary committees, under the influence of military representatives, often study the masses' active thoughts. Many leading members often go deep into the masses, going where there are more problems, understanding the masses' thoughts. Some units also adopt the method of special investigations. Revolutionary cadres, revolutionary masses' representatives, and military representatives go to the actual situation together, dissect specific cases, using the perspective of class struggle and line struggle, observing and analyzing problems in their infancy. Whatever is representative, even if it is one person, one word, or one event, they grasp it without letting go, making ideological work take the lead.

Various levels of revolutionary committees in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region all regard maintaining close ties with the masses and practicing the Three-Eight Style as an important part of strengthening their own construction. Military representatives in the revolutionary committees seriously introduce the tradition of unity between officers and soldiers, and between superiors and subordinates in the army to the members of the revolutionary committees. They take the lead in going deep into workshops, fields, pastures, and schools, studying and applying Chairman Mao's works with the revolutionary masses, working together, and carrying out the struggle, criticism, and transformation together. Under the influence of military representatives, many revolutionary committees, according to Chairman Mao's teachings of "from the masses, to the masses," establish the system of maintaining close ties with the masses. Many leading members insist on going deep into the grassroots, learning from the masses, and practicing the "three-togethers" with the masses, maintaining their revolutionary nature. In the process of helping various levels of revolutionary committees to establish the Three-Eight Style, military representatives all emphasize the need to promptly and seriously implement the great leader Chairman Mao's series of latest instructions, studying and applying Chairman Mao's teachings of "only by grasping something tightly and without relaxation can it be grasped. If it is not grasped tightly, it is as good as not grasping it at all," opposing the style of dragging one's feet and being slack. Some revolutionary committees, in their first meeting after establishment, put cultivating the Three-Eight Style as an important agenda item, discussing and researching it repeatedly, and implementing it seriously. The masses enthusiastically praise, saying: "This is truly a new organization, a new style."

    参加内蒙古各级革委会的部队代表高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗
    积极传播解放军突出政治的经验  帮助革委会树立崭新的革命作风
    新华社呼和浩特电　内蒙古自治区各级革命委员会中的人民解放军代表，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，积极传播人民解放军活学活用毛泽东思想，突出无产阶级政治，坚持四个第一，大兴三八作风的经验，帮助革命委员会树立崭新的革命作风。
    内蒙古自治区各级革命委员会纷纷建立以后，在千头万绪的工作中主要应当抓什么？参加各级革命委员会的人民解放军代表认为，最根本的就是要用毛泽东思想挂帅，突出无产阶级政治，搞好人的思想革命化。这是关系到新诞生的革命委员会能不能巩固，无产阶级文化大革命能不能取得全面胜利的大事。在这一思想的指导下，他们和革命委员会的其他成员一起，认真学习伟大导师毛主席关于政治思想工作的论述和林彪副主席关于活学活用毛主席著作，突出无产阶级政治的指示，向革命委员会的其他成员介绍部队政治思想工作的经验。许多厂矿、企业革命委员会的人民解放军代表，还通过开展革命大批判，帮助革命委员会中的革命领导干部和革命群众代表，进一步认识到突出无产阶级政治的伟大意义。有些单位的领导成员怕群众批评自己工作不负责任，因而成天忙忙碌碌地抓具体工作，放松了思想政治工作。人民解放军代表就向他们介绍部队正确处理政治工作和其他工作的关系的经验，帮助他们破私立公，使他们认识到，革命委员会成立以后，不突出无产阶级政治，不抓毛主席最新指示的落实，不搞阶级斗争，千抓万抓都是瞎抓，千忙万忙都是瞎忙，就是重走老路，就有变色的危险。
    怎样才能用毛泽东思想挂帅，突出无产阶级政治？参加内蒙古自治区各级革命委员会的部队代表认为，必须坚持四个第一，大抓狠抓活思想。他们说，革命委员会领导成员，坚持四个第一，抓好活思想，就能知道群众在做什么、想什么，就能了解到落实毛主席最新指示的新动向、新问题、新经验，工作起来就胸中有数，信心足，办法多。许多革命委员会在解放军代表的带动下，经常研究群众的活思想，许多领导成员经常深入群众，那里问题多，就到那里去，摸清群众的思想脉搏。有些单位还采取专题调查的方法，革命领导干部、革命群众代表和部队代表一起到实际中去，解剖麻雀，用阶级斗争和路线斗争的观点，观察和分析萌芽状态的问题，凡是有代表性的，那怕是一个人、一句话、一件事，都抓住不放，因而使思想工作走在前面。
    内蒙古自治区各级革命委员会，都把密切联系群众、厉行三八作风，作为加强自身建设的一项重要内容。参加革委会的人民解放军代表，认真向革委会成员介绍部队官兵一致、上下一致的传统，并且带头深入车间、田头、牧场、学校，和革命群众一起活学活用毛主席著作，一起劳动，一起搞斗、批、改。在解放军代表的带动下，许多革命委员会按照毛主席关于“从群众中来，到群众中去”的教导，建立了密切联系群众的制度，许多领导成员坚持深入基层，拜群众为师，同群众实行“三同”，保持了革命本色。在帮助各级革命委员会树立三八作风的过程中，人民解放军的代表都强调要雷厉风行、严肃认真地落实伟大领袖毛主席的一系列最新指示，活学活用毛主席“什么东西只有抓得很紧，毫不放松，才能抓住。抓而不紧，等于不抓”的教导，反对拖拖拉拉，松松垮垮的作风。有的革命委员会在成立后的第一次会议上，就把培养三八作风作为一项重要议题，反复进行讨论研究，并且认真进行贯彻。群众热情地称赞说：“这真是新机构，新作风。”
