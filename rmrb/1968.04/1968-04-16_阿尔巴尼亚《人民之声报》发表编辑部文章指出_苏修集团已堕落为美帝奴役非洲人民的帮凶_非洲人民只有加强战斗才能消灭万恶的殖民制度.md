	New China News Agency Tirana, April 14 — The Albanian newspaper "People's Voice" published an editorial on April 14, severely condemning the new colonialist policy of U.S. imperialism aimed at enslaving the African people, and exposing the treacherous plot of the Soviet revisionist traitor clique led by Khrushchev in collusion with U.S. imperialism to sell out the interests of the African people.

	The editorial points out that the current situation in Africa is characterized by the sharp struggle between the people of this continent and the old and new colonialists. The old and new colonialists are fiercely trying to maintain their remaining strongholds with fire and iron and are attempting to re-subjugate the places liberated by the African people through various means. The editorial says that various facts increasingly show that U.S. imperialism is playing the role of a policeman on the African continent.

	After listing facts to expose the political, economic, and military aggression crimes committed by U.S. imperialism against Africa, the editorial points out that the African people have clearly seen that the U.S. imperialists are the savage enemies of the freedom and independence of the African people.

	The editorial points out that the development of various events not only exposes that the imperialists and colonialists led by U.S. imperialism are the enemies of the people of various African countries, but also exposes the true face of the false friends of the African people, the Khrushchev and Tito revisionists. The Brezhnev and Kosygin traitor clique, in collusion with U.S. imperialism, have plotted to extinguish the African liberation movement and enslave the people and countries on this continent that do not submit to Washington and Moscow. It is now increasingly clear that the two-faced policy and capitulationist line of the Soviet revisionist leadership are in line with the needs and plans of Washington. The U.S. and the Soviet revisionists are doing their utmost to expand their influence in Africa, thereby damaging the freedom and independence of the African people.

	The editorial also condemns the Tito clique for acting as a loyal lackey of Washington, shamelessly sabotaging and splitting the anti-imperialist forces in Africa.

	The editorial praises the brilliant victories achieved by the armed struggles of the people of Angola, Mozambique, and "Portuguese" Guinea, and points out that in such a situation, the African people understand more clearly that they must strengthen their struggle and make unremitting efforts to fundamentally eliminate the evil colonial system.

	The editorial concludes by saying that all of Africa is advancing. No matter how difficult the conditions of struggle are, no matter how ferocious and cunning the enemy is, the African people are determined to continue their struggle to realize their aspirations. The future of Africa will ultimately be decided by the African people themselves.

    阿尔巴尼亚《人民之声报》发表编辑部文章指出
    苏修集团已堕落为美帝奴役非洲人民的帮凶
    非洲人民只有加强战斗才能消灭万恶的殖民制度
    新华社地拉那十四日电　阿尔巴尼亚《人民之声报》十四日发表编辑部文章，严厉谴责美帝国主义推行的企图奴役非洲人民的新殖民主义政策，揭露苏联赫鲁晓夫修正主义叛徒集团伙同美帝国主义策划出卖非洲人民利益的险恶阴谋。
    文章指出，当前非洲形势的特点是这个大陆的人民同新老殖民主义者之间的尖锐斗争。新老殖民主义者张牙舞爪地企图用火与铁来维护他们残存的阵地，并企图用各种方法重新统治被非洲人民解放了的地方。文章说，种种事实越来越清楚地表明，美帝国主义已经在非洲大陆扮演着宪兵的角色。
    文章列举事实揭露了美帝国主义对非洲进行的种种政治、经济和军事侵略的罪行之后指出，非洲人民清楚地看到了美帝国主义者是非洲人民自由和独立的野蛮敌人。
    文章指出，各种事件的发展不仅暴露了以美帝国主义者为首的帝国主义者和殖民主义者是非洲各国人民的敌人，而且也暴露了非洲人民的假朋友赫鲁晓夫、铁托修正主义者的真面目。勃列日涅夫、柯西金叛徒集团伙同美帝国主义一道策划了扑灭非洲解放运动以及奴役这个大陆上不愿屈从华盛顿和莫斯科的人民和国家的阴谋诡计。现在日益明显地表明，苏修领导集团的两面派政策和叛卖投降方针是符合华盛顿的需要和计划的。美帝和苏修正在千方百计地扩大自己在非洲的影响范围，以损害非洲人民的自由和独立。
    文章还谴责了铁托集团充当华盛顿的忠实走狗，竭力破坏和分裂非洲反帝力量的可耻行径。
    文章赞扬了安哥拉、莫三鼻给和“葡属”几内亚人民武装斗争所取得的辉煌胜利，并且指出，在这样的情况下，非洲人民更加懂得他们应当加强斗争和作出坚持不懈的努力，以便从根本上消灭万恶的殖民制度。
    文章最后说，整个非洲在前进。不管斗争条件怎样困难，不管面临的是怎样凶恶狡猾的敌人，非洲人民决心为实现自己的愿望而继续斗争。非洲的未来终将由非洲人民自己来决定。
