	There are countless tasks and ever-changing situations, but studying and applying Chairman Mao's works is the first and foremost task. Emphasizing politics must always remain unchanged.

		—Wang Yuchang, Political Instructor, Certain Unit of the Air Force

	Walking the path of emphasizing politics is like traveling on a broad and sunny road; the more you walk, the broader the path becomes. Walking the path of emphasizing military affairs is like walking towards a precipice; the more you walk, the more dangerous it becomes.

		—Wu Xiangning, Platoon Leader, Certain Unit of the Air Force

	Emphasizing politics means using Mao Zedong Thought to guide everything.

		—Zhao Zhisan, Five-Good Soldier, Certain Unit of the Air Force

	Carrying Mao Zedong Thought into the skies and using Mao Zedong Thought to command operations will make you invincible and strike fear into the hearts of your enemies.

		—Ji Dongying, Staff Member, Certain Unit of the Air Force

	Emphasizing politics means having clear vision, a bright heart, strong wings, and the ability to fly ten thousand miles without losing your way, piercing through clouds and fog without obstruction.

		—Zhang Shiwei, Pilot, Certain Unit of the Air Force
