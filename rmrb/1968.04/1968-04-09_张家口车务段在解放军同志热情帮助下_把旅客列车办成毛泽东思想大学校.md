The Zhangjiakou Railway Station Section of the Beijing Railway Bureau, with the enthusiastic assistance of the 4649 Unit's leftist cadre, has followed the great teacher Chairman Mao's instruction to "hold study sessions, which is a good method, and many problems can be solved in study sessions." They have established Mao Zedong Thought study sessions on passenger trains traveling between Beijing and Datong and between Beijing and Zhangjiakou, transforming the people's trains into vibrant schools of Mao Zedong Thought.

Propagating Mao Zedong Thought is the most glorious task

Initially, the revolutionary workers of the Zhangjiakou Railway Station Section discussed the issue of holding Mao Zedong Thought study sessions on trains. The broad revolutionary workers believed that most passengers on the trains were individuals on missions or scattered personnel with few opportunities to participate in their unit's study sessions. Transforming the trains into red bastions for spreading Mao Zedong Thought and mobile classrooms for implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions was a necessity for the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. However, some people emphasized the difficulties, believing it was hard to do, citing that passengers came from all directions, including men, women, children, and the elderly, with varying levels of understanding, making it difficult to grasp their thoughts and arrange content, etc.

To further raise the awareness of the broad revolutionary workers, the leftist cadre from the PLA and the revolutionary committee organized a study of Chairman Mao's teachings on trusting and relying on the masses. They also organized a critique of the revisionist line pushed by Khrushchev and his agents in the railway department. For seventeen years, there has been a sharp struggle between two classes, two lines, and two roads on the trains. A handful of capitalist roaders within the railway department blew the wind of "bonus incentives" and promoted the black goods of "business first." Through the revolutionary criticism, everyone unanimously agreed: Our trains are revolutionary trains and must be guided by the invincible Mao Zedong Thought. We should "completely" and "thoroughly" serve the people and propagate the great Mao Zedong Thought. Establishing Mao Zedong Thought study sessions on passenger trains is the most glorious task bestowed by the times.

After raising their awareness, they immediately began holding passenger train study sessions.

They replaced the corrupting soft music previously played for passengers with inspiring revolutionary songs; they replaced the poisonous little books that glorified emperors and generals with the shining gold volumes of Chairman Mao's works; they replaced the announcements about the seventy-two scenic spots of Guan Gou and the praise of the "Yang Family Generals" with announcements about the experiences and heroic deeds of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works; they replaced the propaganda posters in the carriages that did not emphasize politics with "Revolutionary Passenger Columns on Fighting Selfishness and Criticizing Revisionism." The trains became large classrooms for propagating Mao Zedong Thought.

Holding Mao Zedong Thought study sessions on passenger trains effectively promoted the thought revolution among the train crew, improving service quality. Previously, the crew would stand at the train door at the starting station, waiting for passengers to come. Now, the crew enters the platform, holding the Little Red Book, guiding passengers onto the train. Previously, shift changes were only about business; now, they first exchange Mao Zedong Thought classes. Crew member Zhao Fenglien said, "Now, whenever I do something, I think of myself as a propagandist of Mao Zedong Thought."

Firmly grasp class struggle and consciously fight selfishness and criticize revisionism

The great teacher Chairman Mao teaches us: "Class struggle, once grasped, is effective." In the passenger train study sessions, class education is also the key, and activities to recall bitterness and think of sweetness are held to raise the class consciousness of the passengers. Once, a PLA officer recalled in the train study session the tragic life of his family in the old society, where his uncle's family of five and his younger sister all starved to death while begging for food. In that evil old society, the poor had no place to beg, and parents, in their grief, sold his ten-month-old younger brother for five yuan to buy two highland barley buns. His father took one and broke it in half, giving it to him, and put the other half in his pocket, saying, "Child, you must never forget, the landlords drove our family to ruin, you are eating your brother's blood and flesh!" An elderly peasant from Zulu County, Hebei Province, also recalled in the train study session his life of hard labor from the age of seven, carrying the burden of a long-term laborer for over thirty years. Across from the old man, a middle-aged woman with a seven-year-old daughter listened to the old man's recollections and told her daughter, "Grandpa suffered from the exploitation and oppression of the landlord class from the age of seven, and you are also seven years old, how fortunate you are to grow up in the new era of Mao Zedong Thought!" The little girl immediately said, "I will forever be loyal to Chairman Mao!"

The bitterness of class, the hatred of blood and tears, ignited the revolutionary passengers' intense hatred for the old society and Khrushchev, strengthening their deep class feelings for the great leader Chairman Mao. The broad revolutionary masses deeply felt: Father and mother are not as dear as Chairman Mao, the river is deep and the sea is deep, but not as deep as Chairman Mao's kindness. The bitterness of class, the hatred of blood and tears, became heavy artillery against the "self." A knowledge youth who was not devoted to agricultural production fought against the "self" in his mind after listening to the recall of bitterness in the train study session. He said, "I was not devoted to agricultural production, wanting to find a job in the city, forgetting Chairman Mao's teachings, it was the 'self' that dominated my mind. After participating in the train Mao Zedong Thought study sessions twice, my consciousness was raised. I will resolutely take root in the countryside, and after returning, I will do a good job in grasping the revolution and promoting production, and create new achievements in spring plowing and production for the people."

Through holding study sessions, the crew and passengers together fought selfishness and criticized revisionism, which also promoted the thought revolution among the crew, making everyone realize that the process of holding passenger train study sessions was also a process of fighting against the "self" in one's mind, promoting one's thought revolution, and better serving the people. Once, in the carriage served by crew member Zhao Ruilan, there were many women with children and elderly people, and she felt that it was not as lively to hold study sessions when there were fewer soldiers, Red Guards, and revolutionary workers as passengers. She went to the neighboring carriage and asked the crew member Zhang Yun, "Should we still hold the study session today?" Zhang Yun studied with her the Chairman's quotations: "Our comrades should see achievements and light in times of difficulty, should raise our courage." Zhao Ruilan gathered her courage and immediately returned to her own carriage to organize passengers for study. The result was that the passengers had a good discussion.

Singing praises to Chairman Mao and discussing the great situation

The 4649 Unit's leftist cadre and the revolutionary committee members, through practical experience on the trains and joint research with the crew, based on the characteristics of passenger trains and the urgent needs of revolutionary passengers, made singing praises to the great leader Chairman Mao and discussing the great situation of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution the most important content of each study session.

At the beginning of the study session, the lofty class feelings of loyalty to Chairman Mao, loyalty to Mao Zedong Thought, and loyalty to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line filled every carriage, and the voices singing praises to the great teacher Chairman Mao resonated throughout the train. The crew and passengers together praised Chairman Mao's great contributions to the Chinese revolution and the world revolution; praised the invincible power of Mao Zedong Thought; praised the great victories of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. A comrade from Xuanhua, who had visited the place where the red sun rises, Shao Mountain, three times, when speaking of the great teacher Chairman Mao's great contributions to the Chinese revolution and the world revolution, all passengers listened attentively. He said, "I received a profound education each time I visited, and my loyalty to Chairman Mao increased." A worker from the Guangzhou Trade Fair introduced to the passengers the situation of people from various countries loving Chairman Mao. He said that friends from various countries, every time they entered the doors of the trade fair, would raise the red Little Red Book, wishing Chairman Mao eternal life! He also detailed the story of an African friend loving Chairman Mao. The passengers listened and said, "People of the world love Chairman Mao, and we should love Chairman Mao more, forever be loyal to Chairman Mao."

In the passenger train study sessions, the enthusiastic voices singing praises to the great teacher Chairman Mao and discussing the great situation of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution deeply educated the revolutionary passengers. On March 19, at the beginning of the study session on the 313 train from Beijing to Datong, the crew organized five representatives from a certain artillery academy attending the conference of active members studying Chairman Mao's works to go to various carriages to introduce their happy scenes of seeing our red sun, Chairman Mao, on March 7. When they spoke of Chairman Mao's extremely good health, radiant appearance, and smiling face, as well as Lin Biao's vigorous steps onto the stage, the entire carriage echoed with cheers. Revolutionary passengers, facing Chairman Mao's portrait, with tears of excitement, enthusiastically shouted, "Long live Chairman Mao!" "Chairman Mao lives ten thousand years!" "Wish Chairman Mao eternal life! Eternal life!" The cheers drowned out the sound of the train's departure.

Currently, the revolutionary and production situation of the Zhangjiakou Railway Station Section is excellent, and the broad revolutionary workers are determined to better implement Chairman Mao's great instruction of "grasp the revolution and promote production," making the passenger train Mao Zedong Thought study sessions even better. Let the people's trains always depart to the sound of "The East Is Red," advance to the sound of "Wishing Chairman Mao Eternal Life," and arrive at the destination to the sound of "The Ship Sails on the Sea with the Helmsman."

    张家口车务段在解放军同志热情帮助下
    把旅客列车办成毛泽东思想大学校
    本报讯　北京铁路局张家口车务段，在四六四九部队支左人员的热情帮助下，遵循伟大导师毛主席“办学习班，是个好办法，很多问题可以在学习班得到解决”的教导，在由北京开往大同和由北京开往张家口的往返旅客列车上，大办毛泽东思想学习班，把人民列车办成红彤彤的毛泽东思想大学校。
      宣传毛泽东思想是最光荣的任务
    开始，张家口车务段的革命职工曾就举办列车毛泽东思想学习班问题进行了充分讨论。广大革命职工认为，乘车旅客大部分是单独外出执行任务和一些零散人员，参加本单位学习的机会少，把列车办成传播毛泽东思想的红色阵地，落实毛主席最新指示的流动课堂，这是无产阶级文化大革命的需要。但也有人强调困难多，不好办，认为旅客南来北往、男女老少都有，水平高低不同，活思想难抓，内容不好安排，等等。
    为了进一步提高广大革命职工的认识，解放军支左人员和革命委员会组织大家学习了毛主席关于相信群众和依靠群众的教导。同时，组织大家批判中国赫鲁晓夫及其在铁路部门的代理人推行的修正主义路线。十七年来，在列车上一直存在着两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的尖锐斗争。铁道部门党内一小撮走资派，大刮“奖金挂帅”的妖风，大搞“业务第一”的黑货。通过革命的大批判，大家一致认为：我们的列车是革命的列车，必须用战无不胜的毛泽东思想来指导我们的工作。我们应当“完全”、“彻底”地为人民服务，应当宣传伟大的毛泽东思想。大办旅客列车毛泽东思想学习班，是时代赋予我们最光荣的任务。
    认识提高以后，他们立即动手举办旅客列车学习班。
    他们把过去向旅客播送的腐蚀革命斗志的软绵绵的轻音乐，换成了鼓舞人心的革命歌曲；把毒害人们灵魂的歌颂帝王将相的小人书，换成了金光闪闪的毛主席著作单行本；把向旅客介绍关沟七十二景和歌颂“杨家将”的声音，换成了介绍活学活用毛主席著作的经验和英雄事迹的声音；把张贴在车厢里的不突出政治的宣传画，换成了“革命旅客斗私批修专栏”。列车变成了宣传毛泽东思想的大课堂。
    举办旅客列车毛泽东思想学习班，有效地促进了乘务人员的思想革命化，提高了服务质量。乘务员过去在始发站是站在车门口，等着旅客来，旅客到站台，只管把门开。现在是，乘务员进站台，红宝书拿在手，把旅客接到车上来。过去交接班只是交业务班，现在首先是交毛泽东思想班。乘务员赵风莲说，“现在，我做每一件事的时候，都要想一想我是一个毛泽东思想宣传员。”
      狠抓阶级斗争　自觉斗私批修
    伟大导师毛主席教导我们：“阶级斗争，一抓就灵”。在旅客列车学习班里，同样是以阶级教育为纲，开展忆苦思甜活动，提高旅客们的阶级觉悟。有一次，一位解放军干部在列车学习班里回忆了他全家在旧社会家破人亡的悲惨生活。他叔父一家五口和他亲妹妹在讨饭的路上全被饿死。在那万恶的旧社会，穷人讨饭都无处可讨，父母痛心割肉，把他的刚满十个月的小弟弟卖了五块钱，用这五块钱才买了两个高粱面窝窝头。他父亲拿起一个掰了一半给了他，把那一半揣在了兜里，对他说：“孩子，你可千万不要忘记，地主老财逼得我们家破人亡，你吃的是你弟弟的血和肉啊！”河北省涿鹿县一位六十多岁的贫农社员，也在旅客列车学习班里回忆了从七岁就给地主放猪，一直扛了三十多年长工的牛马不如的生活。在老人对面的一位中年妇女，带着一个七岁的女儿，她听老人忆苦以后，对女儿说：“老爷爷在旧社会从七岁就受地主阶级的剥削压迫，你今年也是七岁了，生长在毛泽东思想新时代有多么幸福啊！”小女孩立即说道：“我要永远忠于毛主席！”
    阶级苦，血泪仇，激发了革命旅客对旧社会和中国赫鲁晓夫的无比仇恨，增强了对伟大领袖毛主席的深厚阶级感情。广大革命群众深深感到：爹亲娘亲不如毛主席亲，河深海深不如毛主席的恩情深。阶级苦，血泪仇，成了向“私”字开火的重型炮弹。有一个不安心农业生产的知识青年，在旅客列车学习班里听了忆苦以后，狠斗了自己头脑中的“私”字。他说：“我不安心农业生产，想到城市里找个工作，这是忘记了毛主席的教导，是‘私’字在我的头脑里占了上风。我两次参加列车毛泽东思想学习班学习以后，使我的觉悟提高了。我要决心在农村扎根，回去以后，很好地抓革命促生产，在春耕生产中为人民立新功。”
    通过办学习班，乘务员和旅客一起斗私批修，也促进了乘务员的思想革命化，使大家体会到：办旅客列车学习班的过程，也是斗自己头脑中的“私”字，促进自己思想革命化，更好地为人民服务的过程。有一次，在乘务员赵瑞兰服务的车厢里，带小孩的妇女和老人比较多，她觉得不如解放军、红卫兵小将和革命职工旅客多的时候办学习班起劲，就到邻车厢问乘务员张云：“今天的学习班还办不办？”张云和她一起学习了毛主席语录：“我们的同志在困难的时候，要看到成绩，要看到光明，要提高我们的勇气。”赵瑞兰鼓足勇气，马上回到本车厢组织旅客学习。结果旅客们讨论得很好。
        歌颂毛主席　畅谈大好形势
    四六四九部队支左人员和车务段革命委员会负责人，经过跟车实践，和乘务人员共同研究，根据旅客列车的特点和革命旅客的迫切要求，每期学习班，都把歌颂伟大领袖毛主席和畅谈无产阶级文化大革命的大好形势作为一项最重要的内容。
    学习班一开始，忠于毛主席，忠于毛泽东思想，忠于毛主席革命路线的崇高阶级感情，就洋溢在各个车厢里，歌颂伟大导师毛主席的声音响彻在整个列车上。乘务员和旅客一起，赞颂毛主席对中国革命和世界革命的伟大贡献；赞颂毛泽东思想的无比威力；赞颂毛主席革命路线的伟大胜利。宣化的一个同志，曾经三次参观过红太阳升起的地方韶山，当他讲到伟大导师毛主席对中国革命和世界革命的伟大贡献的时候，旅客们都听得入了神。他说：“我参观一次，受到一次深刻的教育，对毛主席增加一分忠心。”广州交易会的一个工作人员，向旅客介绍了世界人民热爱毛主席的情况。他说，来自各国的朋友，每天一进交易会的大门，都高举着红彤彤的《毛主席语录》，敬祝毛主席万寿无疆！他还详细介绍了一个非洲朋友热爱毛主席的故事。旅客们听了以后，都说：“世界人民热爱毛主席，我们更要热爱毛主席，永远忠于毛主席。”
    在旅客列车学习班里，热情歌颂伟大导师毛主席和畅谈全国无产阶级文化大革命大好形势的声音，深深教育了革命旅客。三月十九日，由北京开往大同的三一三次列车上的学习班一开始，乘务人员就组织出席炮兵学习毛主席著作积极分子代表大会的某炮兵学院的五名代表，分头到各车厢学习班介绍了他们在三月七日见到我们心中最红的红太阳毛主席的幸福情景。当他们讲到毛主席身体非常非常健康，神采奕奕，容光焕发，满面笑容，同林彪副主席健步登上主席台的时候，整个车厢欢声雷动。革命旅客面对着毛主席像，含着激动的热泪，纵情地高呼：“毛主席万岁！”“毛主席万万岁！”“祝毛主席万寿无疆！万寿无疆！”欢呼声压过了火车开动的声音。
    目前，张家口车务段的革命和生产形势一片大好，广大革命职工决心更好地落实毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的伟大指示，把旅客列车毛泽东思想学习班办得好上加好，让人民的列车永远在《东方红》的歌声中发车，在《祝福毛主席万寿无疆》的歌声中前进，在《大海航行靠舵手》的歌声中到达终点。
