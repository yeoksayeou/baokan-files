The U.S. and Japanese reactionaries have committed another crime against our country by manipulating the "Asian Table Tennis Union" to plot the inclusion of the Chiang bandits in the International Table Tennis Federation.

According to a report by Xinhua News Agency on the 11th, Tokyo: The "Asian Table Tennis Union" recently held a "representative meeting" in Nagoya, Japan, where they schemed to push for the inclusion of the Chiang bandits, who have long been rejected by the Chinese people, into the International Table Tennis Federation. This move serves the U.S. imperialists' plot to create "two Chinas."

Under the manipulation of U.S. imperialism and its lackeys, the "Asian Table Tennis Union" has long been playing tricks to create "two Chinas" and has been against the Chinese people. To further this evil plot, the "Asian Table Tennis Union" came up with new tricks at its recent "representative meeting." At the instigation of U.S. imperialism and its Japanese lackey, the Sato reactionary government, the chairman of the "Asian Table Tennis Union," the Japanese man Goto Koji, enthusiastically arranged for members of the Chiang bandits to participate in the meeting. He also manipulated the meeting to pass a so-called resolution to "recommend" that the Chiang bandits apply to join the International Table Tennis Federation, which includes the Chinese Table Tennis Association. They aim to create a "two Chinas" situation within this international sports organization.

There are also some individuals within the International Table Tennis Federation who, under the instructions of U.S. imperialism, collude with the "Asian Table Tennis Union." Despite repeated serious warnings from our country, they attempt to push the Chiang bandits into the International Table Tennis Federation. However, the plot by U.S. imperialism and its Japanese lackey, the Sato reactionary government, to instigate the "Asian Table Tennis Union" to collude with a small group of reactionaries within the International Table Tennis Federation who are die-hard servants of U.S. imperialism to create "two Chinas" will not succeed. They will only "lift a rock to drop on their own feet" and meet a shameful end.

    美日反动派敌视我国的又一罪行
    操纵“亚洲乒联”阴谋把蒋匪塞进国际乒联
    据新华社十一日讯 东京消息：“亚洲乒乓球联合会”最近在日本名古屋举行“代表会议”，极力策划，图谋把早已为中国人民唾弃的蒋介石匪帮塞进国际乒乓球联合会，为美帝国主义制造“两个中国”的阴谋效劳。
    在美帝国主义及其走狗操纵下的“亚洲乒联”一直玩弄“两个中国”的阴谋，同中国人民为敌。为了进一步推行这个罪恶阴谋，“亚洲乒联”在最近的“代表会议”上又耍出了新的花招。在美帝国主义及其走卒日本佐藤反动政府的唆使下，“亚洲乒联”主席日本人后藤钾二竟然“热心安排”蒋匪帮分子参加了会议，并且操纵会议通过了一项所谓决议，“推荐”蒋匪帮申请加入有中华人民共和国乒乓球协会参加的国际乒乓球联合会，妄图在这个国际体育组织中造成“两个中国”的局面。
    国际乒乓球联合会也有一些别有用心的人，在美帝国主义的指使下，同“亚洲乒联”狼狈为奸，不顾我国一再严重警告，企图把蒋匪帮塞入国际乒乓球联合会。但是，美帝国主义及其走卒日本佐藤反动政府唆使“亚洲乒联”勾结国际乒乓球联合会中一小撮死心塌地为美帝国主义效劳的反动分子制造
  “两个中国”的阴谋，是不会得逞的。他们必将“搬起石头打自己的脚”，落得一个可耻的下场。
