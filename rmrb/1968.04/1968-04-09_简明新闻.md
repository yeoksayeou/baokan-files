		Chilean Workers Oppose U.S. Imperialist Exploitation

	The economic plunder and political enslavement policies imposed by the International Monetary Fund, controlled by the United States, in Chile are increasingly facing fierce opposition from the broad masses of Chilean laborers. In recent times, over ninety thousand workers in Chile's public utilities, civil aviation, gas, and postal services have been on strike since late March, and the strikes are still ongoing. The striking workers strongly demand that the Chilean authorities abolish policies that harm workers' interests.

	On the 3rd, tens of thousands of Chilean students and faculty members, despite the suppression by reactionary military police, took to the streets to march in support of the workers' strike.
