In the revolutionary committees, old cadres work together with young new cadres, learning from each other and helping each other, following Chairman Mao's instructions to ensure that the older generation does not become detached from the masses and that the young receive training.

The new and old cadres of the China Finance Printing Plant Revolutionary Committee follow Chairman Mao's instructions to help each other and learn from each other, ensuring that the older generation does not become detached from the masses and that the young receive training.

Xinhua News Agency, April 1st: The new and old cadres of the China Finance Printing Plant Revolutionary Committee, with the enthusiastic help of the People's Liberation Army's support-left personnel, have seriously studied Chairman Mao's instructions and handled their relationships according to Mao Zedong Thought. The new and old cadres learn from each other and help each other, working together to lead the entire plant's revolution and production.

After the establishment of the revolutionary committee in this plant, it vigorously promoted proletarian politics. The first thing it did was to decide to push the mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works to new heights. The second thing was to formulate measures for the revolutionization of the revolutionary committee. The third thing was to establish rules for the revolutionary committee members. All members, regardless of how busy they are, insist on studying Chairman Mao's works every day and, together with revolutionary workers, study and apply the "Three Articles" extensively, lead the struggle against selfishness and revisionism, and strengthen ideological revolutionization. The new and old cadres of the revolutionary committee often compare their thoughts with Mao Zedong's instructions: "If our party does not have a large number of new cadres working together with old cadres, our cause will be interrupted." "New and old cadres should respect each other, learn from each other, make up for each other's shortcomings, so as to unite and work together for a common cause, and prevent sectarian tendencies."

In the early days of the establishment of the plant's revolutionary committee, some old cadres who had made mistakes were reluctant to approach new cadres; some new cadres saw more faults than virtues in old cadres. After studying Chairman Mao's instructions, they corrected their attitudes, and their relationships improved significantly. Now, old cadres actively approach and unite with new cadres, discover their strengths, praise them promptly, and sincerely learn from them; when they find faults in new cadres, they help them enthusiastically. For example, some new cadres often go deep into the workshops and participate in labor, and old cadres praise this strength. For new cadres who associate more with workers who were originally in their faction and less with those who were not, old cadres promptly point out this shortcoming and remind them to overcome the influence of bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism and strengthen proletarian party spirit. One new cadre is enthusiastic and hardworking, but not humble enough in accepting opinions from the masses. The old cadres affirmed his revolutionary spirit and told him that one of the important reasons for their past mistakes was that they thought they had participated in the revolution for a long time and had more experience, only demanding that the masses obey and not paying attention to learning from the masses and listening to their opinions. The old cadres also encouraged this new cadre to always remember Chairman Mao's instructions, correctly treat the masses, and humbly learn from them. New cadres, through working with old cadres, feel that revolutionary leading cadres are politically more mature, have stronger organizational abilities, and have richer fighting experience. Therefore, they pay attention to respecting and supporting the work of old cadres and learning from their strengths. One old cadre was initially hesitant to work, fearing to make mistakes again. The new cadres had a heart-to-heart talk with him, encouraging him to work boldly. This old cadre gained confidence and played to his strengths in his work.

The revolutionary committee of this plant strengthens the unity of new and old cadres, not in a principle-less harmony, but by putting problems on the table according to Chairman Mao's instructions and using the formula of "unity—criticism and self-criticism—unity" to solve them. They regularly hold life review meetings every week, making self-criticisms when they make mistakes and sincerely pointing out others' shortcomings. One new cadre, after being elected to the revolutionary committee, thought he was an official and set up a desk in the inner room of the meeting room, covered a large glass plate, and although there was already a fluorescent lamp in the room, he brought a desk lamp from the workshop, and even used public bedding to make a bed. After the stationed soldiers pointed out this problem to him, he realized it was a sign of special treatment and, in the life review meeting, seriously compared it with Chairman Mao's instruction to "be both an official and a common person," checked his erroneous thoughts, and immediately corrected them. Afterwards, he often went deep into the workshops and connected with the masses.

In daily work, they advocate face-to-face heart-to-heart talks, exchanging thoughts, and oppose the liberalist style of not saying anything to the face but talking behind the back. This further strengthens the political unity among the members of the revolutionary committee, and the revolutionary enthusiasm and creativity of new and old cadres are better brought into play.

    中国财经印刷厂革委会新老干部遵循毛主席教导互帮互学
    使前辈人不脱离群众  使青年人得到锻炼
    新华社一日讯　中国财经印刷厂革命委员会的新老干部，在人民解放军支左人员的热情帮助下，认真学习毛主席的教导，按照毛泽东思想来处理相互之间的关系，新老干部互相学习，互相帮助，同心协力地领导全厂的革命和生产。
    这个厂革命委员会成立以后，大力突出无产阶级政治，第一件事就是作出把活学活用毛主席著作的群众运动推向新高潮的决定，第二件事是制定了革命委员会革命化措施；第三件事是订出了革命委员会委员守则。全体委员不管工作多忙，天天坚持学习毛主席著作，和革命职工一道大学大用“老三篇”，带头斗私批修，加强思想革命化。革命委员会的新老干部经常对照自己的思想，学习毛主席的指示：“我们党如果没有广大的新干部同老干部一致合作，我们的事业就会中断。”“新老干部应该是彼此尊重，互相学习，取长补短，以便团结一致，进行共同的事业，而防止宗派主义的倾向。”
    厂革命委员会成立初期，有些犯过错误的老干部，对新干部不愿接近；有的新干部，对老干部看缺点多，看优点少。他们学习了毛主席的教导以后，端正了态度，相互关系大大改善。现在，老干部主动亲近和团结新干部，发现新干部的优点，及时表扬，诚恳向他们学习；发现新干部的缺点，就热情帮助。例如，有的新干部能经常深入车间，参加劳动，老干部就表扬他们这个优点。对于有的新干部接近原来和自己一派的工人多，接近原来不是一派的工人少，老干部就及时指出这个缺点，提醒他们注意克服资产阶级、小资产阶级派性的影响，增强无产阶级党性。有个新干部，工作积极肯干，但接受群众意见不够虚心。老干部肯定了他的革命干劲，同时告诉他，自己过去犯错误的重要原因之一，就是总以为自己参加革命时间长，经验多，只要求群众服从，不注意向群众学习，不听取群众的意见。老干部还勉励这个新干部要时时记住毛主席的教导，正确对待群众，虚心向群众学习。新干部在和老干部共同工作中体会到，革命的领导干部政治上比较成熟，组织能力较强，斗争经验比较丰富。因此，他们注意尊重、支持老干部的工作，学习老干部的长处。有个老干部开始工作时，缩手缩脚，怕再犯错误，新干部就和他谈心，鼓励他大胆工作。这个老干部增强了信心，在工作中发挥了自己的长处。
    这个厂的革命委员会加强新老干部的团结，不是无原则的一团和气，而是有了问题，就遵照毛主席的教导，“把问题摆到桌面上来”，运用“团结——批评和自我批评——团结”的公式，加以解决。他们每周定期召开生活检讨会，自己有了错误，就做自我批评，看到别人的缺点，就诚恳地指出来。有个新干部被选入革命委员会以后，认为自己是干部了，就在会议室的里屋，摆了一张办公桌，找了一块大玻璃板铺上，屋里已经有日光灯，他又从车间里搞了个台灯，还用公家的被褥铺了个床。驻厂的解放军给他指出这个问题以后，他认识到这是一种特殊化的苗头，就在生活检讨会上，认真对照毛主席“既当‘官’，又当老百姓”的教导，检查了自己的错误思想，并立即纠正。以后他经常深入车间，联系群众。
    在日常工作中，他们提倡当面交心，进行思想上的交流，反对当面不说，背后乱说的自由主义作风。这样做，进一步从政治上加强了革命委员会成员间的团结，新老干部的革命积极性和创造性更好地发挥出来。
