The military and civilians in the West Saigon-Cho Don region and its surrounding areas of South Vietnam launched continuous attacks on the enemy in March, annihilating over 4,200 enemy personnel, including more than 2,200 American aggressors.

Among the enemy forces annihilated by the People's Liberation Armed Forces were four battalions (including one American battalion) and fourteen companies (including four American companies). Additionally, the People's Liberation Armed Forces shot down and destroyed sixty enemy aircraft, destroyed and damaged more than 220 tanks and armored vehicles, and blew up or burned numerous warehouses containing tens of thousands of tons of explosives and hundreds of thousands of liters of fuel.

The report stated that major enemy bases in the northwest of Saigon, such as Tan Son Nhut Airport and the headquarters of the U.S. 25th Infantry Division, were repeatedly attacked by the liberation forces. On March 4, the People's Liberation Armed Forces annihilated a battalion of American troops in the Cu Chi area, killing and wounding over 500 enemy personnel and seizing a large amount of weapons.

On the 15th and 17th, the guerrilla forces and local troops in Hoc Mon County launched widespread attacks, killing over 100 American and puppet troops and destroying eighteen armored vehicles.

In the northeast of Saigon, the military and civilians of Cu Chi County fought continuously from the 1st to the 5th, annihilating over 600 enemy personnel, including 500 American troops.

On the 14th, the military and civilians of the Ben Cat area in Binh Duong Province launched an attack on a group of American troops in the Thuan Loi Commune, annihilating over 100 enemy personnel in one fell swoop.

In the north of Saigon, the military and civilians of Thuan An County in Binh Duong Province thwarted the enemy's "sweep" on the 25th and 26th, killing and wounding nearly 850 American and puppet troops and destroying sixty-two military vehicles. On the night of the 4th to the early morning of the 5th, the liberation forces attacked the Soai Rap area and Ben Cat in Tay Ninh Province, annihilating two battalions of puppet troops. Subsequently, from the 5th to the 8th, the liberation forces ambushed the enemy in Lai Thieu County and attacked the enemy in the northern New An area of Binh Duong Province, killing and wounding nearly 500 enemy personnel.

American aggressors were defeated by the South Vietnamese liberation forces and fled in disarray, scrambling to board helicopters to escape.
