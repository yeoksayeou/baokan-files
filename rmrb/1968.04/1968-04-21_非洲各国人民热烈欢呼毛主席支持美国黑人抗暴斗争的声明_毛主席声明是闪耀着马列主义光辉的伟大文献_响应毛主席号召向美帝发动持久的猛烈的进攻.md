African peoples, who are bravely advancing in the struggle against imperialism and colonialism, warmly hail Chairman Mao's statement supporting the U.S. black people's struggle against violence as a great document of international significance. They believe that Chairman Mao's statement not only points out the way to victory for the U.S. black people but also for all the peoples of the world.

In Algiers, a veteran of the Algerian anti-French war, Uamara, said excitedly to a Xinhua News Agency correspondent after reading Chairman Mao's statement supporting the U.S. black people's struggle against violence: "Chairman Mao's statement is excellent! It proclaims the doom of U.S. imperialism. U.S. imperialism is the common enemy of the peoples of the world. It has already stepped onto the gallows of the peoples of the world."

He stressed that Chairman Mao's statement not only points out the only correct and victorious path for the North American people in their struggle for liberation but also for all the oppressed peoples and nations of the world in their struggle for liberation.

The veteran enthusiastically praised the great leader Chairman Mao. He said: "Chairman Mao is the great teacher of the world revolution. Mao Zedong Thought is the invincible and powerful ideological weapon of the peoples of the world."

An Algerian worker, Sadik, told a Xinhua News Agency correspondent: "Chairman Mao's statement is a heavy blow to U.S. imperialism and a great encouragement to the peoples of the world. This statement is a great document shining with the brilliance of Marxism-Leninism. We Algerian people and the peoples of the world must study this statement well and use it to guide our struggle."

A Tanzanian journalist in Dar es Salaam told a Xinhua News Agency correspondent: "Chairman Mao's statement is the most correct analysis of the situation by the greatest contemporary Marxist-Leninist."

He said: "The revolutionary peoples of the world will certainly respond to Chairman Mao's call to 'unite more closely and launch a sustained and fierce attack on our common enemy, U.S. imperialism, and its accomplices.' He shouted: 'Long live the invincible Mao Zedong Thought!'"

A Congolese (Kinshasa) student in Cairo told a Xinhua News Agency correspondent: "Chairman Mao's statement is a great encouragement to us." He said, "This is a powerful ideological weapon for the world revolutionary peoples in their common struggle against U.S. imperialism and Soviet modern revisionism."

He went on to say: "From the recent struggles of the U.S. black people, we have seen more clearly the paper tiger nature of U.S. imperialism, which is strong on the outside but weak on the inside. U.S. imperialism is in a state of utter confusion due to insurmountable difficulties at home and abroad, and its days are numbered. Chairman Mao is right: 'It can be said with certainty that the thorough collapse of colonialism, imperialism, and all systems of exploitation, and the thorough emancipation of all oppressed peoples and nations, are not far off.' We firmly believe in this great truth."

He said: "Chairman Mao's recent statement, as well as his statements in recent years supporting the revolutionary struggles of peoples in other places, including the 1964 statement supporting our Congolese (Kinshasa) people in their struggle against U.S. aggression, shows our great leader Chairman Mao's sincere concern and great support for the struggles of the oppressed peoples of the world. We will follow Chairman Mao's teachings and apply these teachings in our own struggles to achieve our thorough emancipation."

An Ethiopian student in Cairo told a Xinhua News Agency correspondent: "The statement recently issued by the greatest leader of the world revolutionary peoples, Chairman Mao, is a great support for us African peoples and the oppressed peoples of all countries. Under the guidance of the brilliant Mao Zedong Thought, we will strengthen our struggle and overthrow imperialism, revisionism, and the reactionaries of all countries as soon as possible. We wish the greatest contemporary Marxist-Leninist, Chairman Mao, eternal life!"

A South African freedom fighter, Themba, in Cairo said: "Chairman Mao's statement is a universal truth for the peoples of the world. We will follow Chairman Mao's call to unite more closely and launch a sustained and fierce attack on our common enemy, U.S. imperialism, and its accomplices." He concluded with a shout: "Down with U.S. imperialism! Long live our great leader and great teacher, Chairman Mao Zedong! Ten thousand years!"

A Cameroonian friend, Ongaku, said: "The statement by the great leader of the world revolutionary peoples, Chairman Mao, is a great encouragement to the U.S. black people, the Vietnamese people, and all the peoples of the world who are fighting against U.S. imperialism. He pointed out that Chairman Mao's statement once again shows the U.S. black people the way to freedom and liberation.

Ongaku said: "Imperialism is now in a state of internal and external difficulties. All its lines of defense are collapsing. Now the world revolution has entered a great new era, an era in which the revolutionary peoples of the world learn from Mao Zedong Thought and apply Mao Zedong Thought in their struggle against imperialism, colonialism, and reactionaries led by the United States. We believe that by holding high the red flag of Mao Zedong Thought, we will surely achieve final victory."

    非洲各国人民热烈欢呼毛主席支持美国黑人抗暴斗争的声明
    毛主席声明是闪耀着马列主义光辉的伟大文献
    响应毛主席号召向美帝发动持久的猛烈的进攻
    据新华社二十日讯　在反帝反殖斗争中奋勇前进的非洲各国人民，热烈地欢呼毛主席支持美国黑人抗暴斗争的声明的伟大国际意义。他们认为，毛主席的声明不仅为美国黑人，而且为全世界人民指明了走向胜利的道路。
    阿尔及利亚抗法老战士乌阿玛尔在读了毛主席支持美国黑人抗暴斗争的声明之后兴奋地在阿尔及尔对新华社记者说：毛主席的声明好得很！这个声明宣告了美帝国主义将要彻底灭亡的命运。美帝国主义是世界人民的共同敌人，它已经走上了世界人民的绞刑架。
    他强调指出，毛主席的声明不仅指出了北美人民进行解放斗争的唯一正确的胜利道路，而且也指出了世界所有被压迫人民和民族进行解放斗争的唯一正确的胜利道路。
    这位老战士热情赞扬伟大领袖毛主席。他说：“毛主席是世界革命的伟大导师，毛泽东思想是世界人民的不可战胜的强大思想武器。”
    阿尔及利亚工人萨迪克对新华社记者说，毛主席的声明是对美帝国主义的沉重打击，是对世界人民的巨大鼓舞。这个声明是闪耀着马克思列宁主义光辉的伟大文献。我们阿尔及利亚人民和全世界人民必须好好地学习这个声明，用这个声明来指导我们的斗争。
    一位坦桑尼亚新闻工作者在达累斯萨拉姆对新华社记者说，毛主席的声明，是当代最伟大的马克思列宁主义者对形势的最正确的分析。
    他说，世界革命人民一定会响应毛主席的响亮号召，“更紧密地团结起来，向着我们的共同敌人美帝国主义及其帮凶们发动持久的猛烈的进攻”。他高呼：“战无不胜的毛泽东思想万岁！”
    在开罗的一位刚果（金）学生对新华社记者说：“毛主席的声明是对我们的巨大鼓舞。”他说，这是世界革命人民反对美帝国主义和苏联现代修正主义的共同斗争的强大思想武器。”
    他接着说：“从最近美国黑人的斗争中，我们更加看清了美帝国主义外强中干的纸老虎本质。美帝国主义被国内外的无法克服的困难弄得焦头烂额，它的寿命肯定不会很长了。毛主席说得对：‘可以肯定，殖民主义、帝国主义和一切剥削制度的彻底崩溃，世界上一切被压迫人民、被压迫民族的彻底翻身，已经为期不远了。’我们坚信这一伟大真理。”
    他说：“毛主席最近发表的声明，以及他过去几年发表的支持其他地方人民的革命斗争的声明，包括一九六四年支持我们刚果（金）人民反对美国侵略的声明，表明了我们伟大领袖毛主席对全世界被压迫人民斗争的真诚的关切和巨大的支持。我们要遵循毛主席的教导，在我们自己的斗争中运用这些教导以实现我们的彻底翻身。”
    一位埃塞俄比亚学生在开罗对新华社记者说：“世界革命人民最伟大的领袖毛主席最近发表的声明，是对我们非洲人民和世界各国被压迫人民的巨大支持。在光辉的毛泽东思想的指导下，我们将加强我们的斗争，早日打倒帝国主义、修正主义和各国反动派。我们祝当代最伟大的马克思列宁主义者毛主席万寿无疆！”
    在开罗的南非自由战士特姆巴说：“毛主席的声明是对世界人民普遍适用的真理。我们将遵循毛主席的号召，更紧密地团结起来，向着我们的共同敌人美帝国主义及其帮凶们发动持久的猛烈的进攻。”他最后高呼：“打倒美帝国主义！”“我们的伟大领袖和伟大导师毛泽东主席万岁！万万岁！”
    喀麦隆朋友翁加库说：世界革命人民的伟大领袖毛主席的声明，是对美国黑人、越南人民以及全世界同美帝国主义作斗争的各国人民的巨大鼓舞。他指出，毛主席的声明，再一次向美国黑人指明了争取自由和解放的道路。
    翁加库说：“帝国主义现在内外交困。它的各条防线都在崩溃之中。现在世界革命进入了一个伟大的新时代，即全世界革命人民学习毛泽东思想、并把毛泽东思想运用于反对以美国为首的帝国主义、殖民主义和反动派的斗争的时代。我们相信，我们高举毛泽东思想的红旗，就一定会取得最后胜利。”
