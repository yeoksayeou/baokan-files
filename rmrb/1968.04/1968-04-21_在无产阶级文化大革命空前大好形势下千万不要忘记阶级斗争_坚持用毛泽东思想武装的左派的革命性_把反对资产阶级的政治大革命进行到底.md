In the unprecedented good situation of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, never forget class struggle. Persist in arming the revolutionary left with Mao Zedong Thought. Carry the political revolution against the bourgeoisie to the end.

The news of the birth of the Anhui Revolutionary Committee in the storm of class struggle has been received with enthusiastic cheers by hundreds of millions of military and civilian personnel across the country. Revolutionary masses and revolutionary cadres in various places have expressed their determination to remember Chairman Mao's great teachings of "never forget class struggle" and "pursue the fleeing enemy while you still have strength" in this unprecedented good situation of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution across the country. They will closely follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, grasp the struggle between the two classes, two roads, and two lines, and be especially vigilant and resolute in opposing rightist splittism, rightist capitulationism, and rightist conservatism. They will take the initiative to launch fierce attacks on the enemies of the proletariat without stopping, and strive for the overall victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. Revolutionary masses and cadres in various places have also expressed their determination to follow Chairman Mao's teachings on conducting class analysis of factionalism, to persist in the factionalism of the proletarian revolutionary left, that is, to persist in the party spirit of the vanguard of the proletariat, that is, to be armed with Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, and to be revolutionary leftists; resolutely oppose the factionalism of rightist opportunism, conservatism, the factionalism of those who are "left" in form but right in essence, and all the factionalism of counter-revolutionary two-faced characters, that is, the factionalism of the bourgeoisie within the revolutionary ranks. Under the principle of revolution, they will consolidate and develop the great alliance of the revolution, distinguish between enemy and people's internal contradictions, and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to the end.

Revolutionary committees or revolutionary preparatory committees in Beijing, Shanghai, Tianjin, Guangdong, Jiangxi, Jilin, Heilongjiang, Henan, Hubei, Hunan, Jiangsu, Shanxi, Inner Mongolia, Shandong, Guizhou, Gansu, Zhejiang, Hebei, Guangxi, and Sichuan have sent congratulatory telegrams to the Anhui Revolutionary Committee, expressing their warm congratulations to the proletarian revolutionaries, revolutionary people, and the broad ranks of soldiers and officers of the People's Liberation Army stationed in Anhui. Revolutionary masses in many places have held various celebrations. Revolutionary masses in various places have pointed out that the successive appearance of revolutionary committees in many provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions across the country is an important sign of the unprecedented good situation of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution across the country, a result of the wise leadership of the proletarian headquarters headed by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin, and a great victory of Mao Zedong Thought and Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. It is a great victory for the proletarian revolutionaries across the country.

Great leader Chairman Mao recently pointed out profoundly: "The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is essentially a political revolution of the proletariat against the bourgeoisie and all exploiting classes under the conditions of socialism. It is a continuation of the long-term struggle between the Chinese Communist Party and the revolutionary masses led by it and the Kuomintang reactionaries, and a continuation of the class struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie." Revolutionary masses and cadres in various places, while celebrating the victory of the proletarian revolutionaries in Anhui, have expressed their determination to launch fierce attacks on the enemies of the proletariat under the guidance of Chairman Mao's latest instructions. Revolutionary masses and cadres in the capital have pointed out that in this unprecedented good situation of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution across the country, we must not forget for a moment that a small handful of stubborn walkers of the capitalist road within the party and traitors and spies, these remnants of the Kuomintang reactionaries, will inevitably make desperate struggles. We must further arm ourselves with Chairman Mao's latest instructions and launch sustained and fierce attacks on the enemies of the proletariat. We must hit the enemies of the proletariat accurately, fiercely, and steadily, without the slightest leniency. We must follow Chairman Mao's teachings and be good at distinguishing between two types of contradictions of different natures. For our own people, for revolutionary comrades who have made mistakes, whether they are revolutionary masses or revolutionary cadres, we must help them rectify their mistakes, learn from the past and guard against the future, and cure the sickness to save the patient. Revolutionary cadres of the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region have expressed that we, the proletarian revolutionaries of Ningxia, will definitely take the proletarian revolutionaries of Anhui as an example, always remember Chairman Mao's teachings, and talk about and grasp class struggle year after year, month after month, and day after day. Members of the revolutionary committees of Jiangsu Province and Nanjing City have expressed that they will definitely follow Chairman Mao's latest instructions, build the revolutionary committees of Jiangsu Province and Nanjing City into revolutionary command headquarters that are characterized by proletarian politics, full of revolutionary vigor, decisive, and efficient, lead the broad revolutionary people to grasp class struggle, carry out in-depth and sustained revolutionary criticism, and launch sustained and fierce attacks on class enemies without stopping. They will criticize and expose the traitors, spies, and counter-revolutionaries hidden within, and thoroughly defeat them. Revolutionary masses and cadres in many places have pointed out that at present, we must be especially vigilant and resolute in opposing rightist splittism, rightist capitulationism, and rightist conservatism, strengthen the awareness of enemy situations, and be a hundred times more vigilant in revolution to smash the counter-revolutionary restoration plots and all sabotage activities of the class enemies.

While celebrating the birth of the Anhui Revolutionary Committee, revolutionary masses and cadres in various places have seriously studied Chairman Mao's teachings on conducting class analysis of factionalism and unanimously expressed their determination to better enhance proletarian party spirit and resolutely oppose the various manifestations of bourgeois factionalism within the revolutionary ranks. Revolutionary cadres of the Shanghai Ink Factory, Shanghai Steel Plant No. 1, and Shanghai Steel Plant No. 2 have said that they will definitely persist in the party spirit of the vanguard of the proletariat and resolutely fight against the factionalism of rightist opportunism, conservatism, the factionalism of those who are "left" in form but right in essence, and all the factionalism of counter-revolutionary two-faced characters. They will continuously consolidate and develop the great alliance of the revolution and the three-in-one combination based on the principles of Mao Zedong Thought and carry the political revolution of the proletariat against the bourgeoisie and all exploiting classes to the end. Some members of the Tianjin Revolutionary Committee said at a symposium held today that they will persist in studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought, arm their minds with Mao Zedong Thought, further enhance proletarian revolutionary spirit, and become true proletarian revolutionaries. They will unswervingly serve the interests of the proletariat, the interests of socialism, and the interests of the broad revolutionary masses, persist in grasping the power of the proletariat with the party spirit of the vanguard of the proletariat, and using the power of the proletariat. The head of the Qinghai Province August 18th United Committee said that they will learn from the proletarian revolutionaries of Anhui, strengthen unity based on the principles of Mao Zedong Thought, resolutely oppose the various manifestations of bourgeois factionalism within the revolutionary ranks, and be a hundred times more vigilant against the class enemies' attempts to sow discord.

Revolutionary masses and cadres in various places have expressed their determination to closely follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment and further implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions while celebrating the establishment of the Anhui Revolutionary Committee. They will definitely strive for the overall victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. Members of the revolutionary committees of Hubei Province and Wuhan City have seriously studied the important editorial "The Victory of the Proletarian Revolutionaries." They have expressed that they will definitely, under the leadership of the proletarian headquarters headed by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin, closely follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, further vigorously carry out Mao Zedong Thought study classes, bring the problems of class struggle and the struggle between the two lines to the study of Mao Zedong Thought, and unconditionally implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions to carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to the end. Comrades attending the expanded meeting of the Henan Revolutionary Committee have expressed that they will carry out in-depth and sustained revolutionary criticism, thoroughly eliminate the poison of counter-revolutionary revisionism spread by the handful of top walkers of the capitalist road within the party such as China's Khrushchev, and let the great Mao Zedong Thought occupy all positions. Revolutionary masses and cadres in Liaoning, Shaanxi, Sichuan, and other places have expressed their determination to learn from the proletarian revolutionaries of Anhui, hold high the great red flag of Mao Zedong Thought, carry out in-depth and sustained revolutionary criticism, further consolidate and develop the great alliance of the revolution and the three-in-one combination based on the principles of Mao Zedong Thought, and strive for the early establishment of revolutionary committees in their regions. Revolutionary workers of the Shijiazhuang Railway Locomotive Section have completed the transportation tasks assigned by the state month after month this year. They have expressed their determination to further implement Chairman Mao's great policy of "grasp revolution, promote production, work, and preparedness for war" and achieve double victories in revolution and production. Revolutionary masses in many places have expressed that they will definitely implement Chairman Mao's great call of "support the army and love the people" and further strengthen military-civilian unity.

Broad ranks of soldiers and officers of the People's Liberation Army have enthusiastically cheered the birth of the Anhui Revolutionary Committee. They have expressed that they will learn from the brotherly units stationed in Anhui, resolutely implement the great call of the great leader Chairman Mao to "support the leftist broad masses," and together with the broad proletarian revolutionaries and revolutionary masses, closely follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, firmly grasp the direction of the struggle, and continue to launch attacks on the handful of top walkers of the capitalist road within the party such as China's Khrushchev and their agents in various places. Soldiers and officers fighting on the front line of "three supports and two militaries" have, while celebrating the establishment of the Anhui Revolutionary Committee, studied Chairman Mao's latest great teachings together with the local proletarian revolutionaries. They have said that they will use Chairman Mao's series of latest instructions as sharp weapons, further do a good job in the "three supports and two militaries" work, help the proletarian revolutionaries and revolutionary masses further enhance their awareness of class struggle and line struggle, strengthen proletarian party spirit, and continuously consolidate and develop the great alliance of the revolution and the three-in-one combination based on the principles of Mao Zedong Thought. They will carry out extensive and in-depth revolutionary criticism, do a good job in the struggle, criticism, and reform of each unit, and achieve new merits in the great struggle for the overall victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.
