Chairman Mao's statement in support of the American black people's struggle against violence has greatly inspired the people of Arab countries. Many Arab friends have emphasized that Chairman Mao's statement not only gives great encouragement to the struggling American black people but also to all oppressed peoples and nations around the world in their fight against U.S.-led imperialism and colonialism.

On April 17, Syrian renowned writer Jawdat al-Rikabi received a reporter from Xinhua News Agency in Damascus and said: "Chairman Mao's statement supporting the American black people's struggle against violence is not only a support for the American black people's struggle but also a support for all revolutionary peoples around the world in their struggle against U.S. imperialism."

Rikabi said: "Martin Luther King, Jr. advocated non-violent struggle, but American white racists did not refrain from using violence to assassinate him. This further exposes the so-called freedom and democracy in the United States, which is the freedom to kill black people and the democracy to suppress black people."

Rikabi pointed out that the struggle of American black people against racial oppression has been launched on a large scale within the United States, demonstrating the powerful force of the black people's struggle against violence. "This is a reflection of the class struggle within the United States, indicating that U.S. imperialism is doomed."

Rikabi said that Chairman Mao had predicted that the lifespan of U.S. imperialism would not be long. U.S. imperialism is rampant everywhere, and therefore it faces strong resistance everywhere. The American black people, the Arab people, and the Vietnamese people are all fighting bravely, and U.S. imperialism will surely be overthrown by the people of the world.

An Iraqi friend in Baghdad told a reporter from Xinhua News Agency: "What Chairman Mao said in his statement supporting the American black people's struggle against violence is very important and correct. The struggle of American black people is a great help and encouragement to the Vietnamese people in their struggle against U.S. imperialism, to the Arab people in their struggle against U.S. imperialism and its faithful dog Israel, and to all peoples of the world in their struggle against U.S.-led imperialism and colonialism. We, the Iraqi people, fully support the just struggle of American black people and fully support the struggle of all oppressed nations and peoples in Asia, Africa, Latin America, and the world against U.S.-led imperialism and colonialism."

An elderly Iraqi, after reading Chairman Mao's statement, told a reporter from Xinhua News Agency: "History has repeatedly proven this truth: using non-violence against imperialism and colonialism achieves nothing. Chairman Mao's statement is a great support for the American black people's struggle against the violent rule of the U.S. imperialist ruling class."

A Palestinian fighter in Baghdad told a reporter from Xinhua News Agency: "Chairman Mao's statement not only gives great encouragement to American black people but also to all oppressed nations and peoples around the world in their struggle against U.S.-led imperialism and colonialism." He said that in the armed struggle against U.S. imperialism and Zionism, the Palestinian people have received great assistance and support from the Chinese people.

A Sudanese friend in Khartoum wrote in an article after reading Chairman Mao's statement: "Chairman Mao pointed out that the nature of imperialism is unchangeable, and imperialists will never lay down their butcher knives; they will never become Buddhas. 'The oppressed peoples and nations cannot entrust their liberation to the 'wisdom' of imperialists and their running dogs but can only achieve victory through strengthening unity and persevering in struggle.' He went on to write that the death of Martin Luther King, Jr., the leader of the non-violent movement, proves that the nature of U.S. imperialism is unchangeable.

This Sudanese friend wrote: "The struggle of American black people shows the class contradictions and sharp class struggle within the United States. Black people and all oppressed peoples must wage armed struggle, using revolutionary violence against counter-revolutionary violence. U.S. imperialism is the oppressor of black people and the common enemy of the entire working class. American black people must unite with the American proletariat and the proletariat of the world to win victory."

This Sudanese friend continued: "The U.S. revisionists, under the control of Soviet revisionism, advocate obtaining 'civil rights' through peaceful means to oppose the armed struggle of black people. This attitude exposes the ugly face of Soviet revisionists and their betrayal of the armed struggle against imperialism and its running dogs. This also exposes the collaboration of the Soviet revisionist leadership with the reactionaries and their betrayal of the struggling people."

This Sudanese friend emphasized: "Chairman Mao's statement is a brilliant Marxist-Leninist document. This statement provides ideological weapons for the struggle of American black people and illuminates the path for the struggle of American black people. U.S. imperialism is a paper tiger, strong on the outside but weak on the inside. It is already in a predicament of internal and external troubles, and its lifespan will not be long. The struggle of American black people will surely be victorious."

    阿拉伯朋友赞扬毛主席声明鼓舞世界人民进行反帝斗争
    毛主席声明照亮美国黑人斗争的道路
    苏修领导集团鼓吹“和平道路”暴露它同反动派合作的叛徒面目
    新华社十九日讯　毛主席支持美国黑人抗暴斗争的声明，极大地鼓舞了阿拉伯国家的人民。许多阿拉伯朋友强调指出，毛主席的声明，不仅给了斗争中的美国黑人以巨大的鼓舞，而且给了全世界一切被压迫人民和被压迫民族反对以美国为首的帝国主义和殖民主义的斗争以巨大的鼓舞。
    叙利亚著名作家贾瓦特·里卡比十七日在大马士革接见新华社记者时说：毛主席支持美国黑人抗暴斗争的声明“不仅是对美国黑人斗争的支持，也是对全世界一切革命人民反对美帝国主义斗争的支持。”
    里卡比说：“美国黑人马丁·路德·金主张非暴力斗争，但美国白人种族主义分子并没有因此而不用暴力把他暗杀掉。这进一步暴露了美国所标榜的自由和民主，是屠杀美国黑人的自由，是镇压美国黑人的民主。”
    里卡比指出，美国黑人反对种族压迫的斗争已经在美国国内大规模展开，表明了黑人抗暴斗争的强大力量。“这是美国国内阶级斗争的反映，表明美帝国主义已经末日临头。”
    里卡比说，毛主席曾经预言，美帝国主义的寿命不会很长了。美帝国主义到处横行霸道，因而到处遭到强烈的反抗。美国黑人、阿拉伯人民和越南人民正在进行英勇斗争，美帝国主义必将被世界人民打倒。
    一位伊拉克朋友在巴格达对新华社记者说：“毛主席在支持美国黑人抗暴斗争的声明中所说的话是非常重要和正确的。美国黑人的斗争，对越南人民反对美帝国主义的斗争，对阿拉伯人民反对美帝国主义及其忠实走狗以色列的斗争，对全世界人民反对美帝国主义的斗争，都是巨大的援助和鼓舞。我们伊拉克人民完全支持美国黑人的正义斗争，完全支持亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲和全世界一切被压迫民族和人民反对以美国为首的帝国主义和殖民主义的斗争。”
    一位伊拉克老人在读了毛主席的声明以后，对新华社记者说：“历史多次证明这个真理：用非暴力对付帝国主义和殖民主义，什么也不能实现。毛主席的声明是对美国黑人反对美帝国主义统治集团的暴力斗争的巨大支持。”
    在巴格达的一巴勒斯坦战士对新华社记者说：“毛主席的声明，不但给了美国黑人巨大鼓舞，而且给了全世界一切被压迫民族和人民反对以美帝国主义为首的帝国主义和殖民主义的斗争以巨大的鼓舞。”他说，巴勒斯坦人民在反对美帝国主义和以色列犹太复国主义的武装斗争中，得到了中国人民的巨大援助和巨大支持。
    一位苏丹朋友在喀土穆读了毛主席的声明后在文章中写道：“毛主席指出，帝国主义的本性是不能改变的，帝国主义分子决不肯放下屠刀，他们也决不能成佛。‘被压迫人民和被压迫民族，决不能把自己的解放寄托在帝国主义及其走狗的“明智”上面，而只有通过加强团结、坚持斗争，才能取得胜利。’”他接着写道，非暴力主义运动领袖马丁·路德·金之死，证明美帝国主义的本性是不能改变的。
    这位苏丹朋友写道：“美国黑人的斗争表明了美国国内的阶级矛盾和尖锐的阶级斗争。黑人和一切被压迫人民必须进行武装斗争，用革命的暴力反对反革命的暴力。美帝国主义是黑人的压迫者，也是全体工人阶级的共同敌人。美国黑人必须同美国无产阶级和全世界的无产阶级团结起来，才能赢得胜利。”
    这位苏丹朋友继续写道：“美国的修正主义者，在苏联修正主义的支配下，鼓吹通过和平手段取得‘公民权利’，用以反对黑人的武装斗争。这种态度暴露了苏联修正主义者的丑恶面目，以及它对反对帝国主义及其走狗的武装斗争的背叛。这也暴露了苏修领导集团同反动派合作，背叛斗争中的人民。”
    这位苏丹朋友强调指出：“毛主席的声明是一个光辉的马克思列宁主义的文件。这个声明给美国黑人的斗争提供了思想武器，照亮了美国黑人斗争的道路。美帝国主义是纸老虎，外强中干。它已经陷于内外交困的境地，它的寿命不会很长了，美国黑人的斗争必将胜利。”
