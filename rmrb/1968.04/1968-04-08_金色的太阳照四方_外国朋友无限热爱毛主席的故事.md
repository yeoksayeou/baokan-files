The golden sun shines everywhere
— Stories of foreign friends' deep love for Chairman Mao

Mao Zedong is the red sun

One day, Chinese sailors and Japanese sailors went to Guangzhou together for a tour. On the bus, Japanese sailors eagerly asked Chinese sailors for Chairman Mao's badges. The Chinese sailors selected badges with commemorative significance such as "Shaoshan," "Jinggangshan," "Ruijin," "Zunyi," and "Yanan," and gave each of them one. The Japanese sailors received the shiny gold Chairman Mao badges as if they were treasures, overjoyed. Some sailors held the badges in their hands, looking at them repeatedly; some sailors immediately pinned the badges on their chests, adjusting them over and over until they were perfectly straight; some sailors placed the badges on their hearts, reluctant to put them down. One sailor said, "The badge I received is red. The red sun has illuminated my heart, and my red heart will forever be with Mao Zedong!" Another sailor eagerly added, "The badge I received is golden. The golden sun shines everywhere, and the ship will not lose its way at sea."

At this moment, the other Japanese sailors gathered around the two sailors, eagerly looking at their golden and red Chairman Mao badges. One Japanese sailor pointed to the Chairman Mao badge on his chest, excitedly and emotionally saying, "Mao Zedong is the red sun, and the red sun has illuminated our hearts." The Chinese sailors, seeing this scene, were deeply moved. One of them couldn't help but say, "Yes, Chairman Mao is the brightest red sun in the hearts of all the people of China and the world."

Suddenly, the bus filled with the songs "The East Is Red" and "Sailing the Seas Depends on the Helmsman."

Shouting "Long Live Chairman Mao!" repeatedly

Once, workers at Huangpu Port held a meeting in the sailors' club. The shouts of "Long Live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years!" grew louder and louder. At this time, an African sailor came to the club for some business. When he heard the shouts of "Long Live Chairman Mao!" from the auditorium, he immediately stopped in his tracks, listening intently. After listening for a while, he excitedly ran into the auditorium and said to the Chinese workers, "I want to shout 'Long Live Chairman Mao!' with you!" Saying this, he raised his arm and shouted, "Long Live Chairman Mao! Long Live Chairman Mao!" repeatedly, more than ten times.

Later, the club members learned that this sailor came from a poor family and had long admired the great leader Chairman Mao. Because of his progressive thinking, he was labeled a "madman" by the reactionaries and was imprisoned for four years. The cruel persecution made him even more eager to seek the truth and love Chairman Mao even more. He often told others, "Mao Zedong, great!"

Three times taking photos in front of Chairman Mao's statue

Not long ago, more than ten Japanese sailors came to visit the former site of the Peasant Movement Training Institute in Guangzhou. Chairman Mao personally established the institute and led the great practice of the Chinese revolution, deeply inspiring the visitors from afar. They carefully examined every exhibit and listened attentively to every introduction.

After the tour, they came to the main hall where Chairman Mao's statue stands, excitedly discussing. Everyone's words were filled with boundless love and respect for Chairman Mao. At this time, a middle-aged sailor pointed to Chairman Mao's statue and said to everyone, "Let's take a photo in front of Chairman Mao's statue to remember this moment!" His suggestion exactly expressed the sailors' wishes, and everyone agreed. Some took photos in pairs, while others took group photos of three or five people. The sailors regarded taking photos in front of Chairman Mao's statue as the greatest happiness.

There was a sailor about forty years old. Although he had taken two group photos with his comrades, he was still not satisfied and wanted to take another solo photo. He brushed off the dust on his clothes again and again, straightened his clothes, and then stood in front of Chairman Mao's statue, looking spirited and smiling brightly. After taking the photo, he smiled and said to everyone, "This is my third time taking a photo in front of Chairman Mao's statue."

The great image made him excited

On a Sunday, many foreign friends were reading Chairman Mao's works and various magazines in the reading room of the sailors' club. Some sat for several hours without leaving.

A Greek sailor was flipping through "People's Pictorial." He would look at the magazine and then at the Chairman Mao badge on his chest, with a happy smile on his face. The staff was attracted by this touching scene and walked over to take a look. It turned out that the sailor was looking at the colorful portrait of our great leader Chairman Mao in the magazine. Chairman Mao, dressed in a green military uniform, looked radiant and full of vitality, waving to the millions of Red Guards on Tiananmen Gate. Seeing Chairman Mao's great image, the sailor was deeply moved. When he saw the staff approaching, he stood up, smiled, and pointed to the single-page colorful portrait of Chairman Mao in the magazine, saying to the staff, "I want this portrait of Mao Zedong!" The staff smiled and nodded in agreement. At this moment, the sailor was overjoyed. He took the colorful portrait of Chairman Mao and quickly ran back to his ship.

The whole family wears Chairman Mao badges

After dinner, port workers came to an Italian ship. As soon as they boarded, more than ten Italian sailors ran up and surrounded them. At this moment, more than ten pairs of bright eyes were all focused on the red and shiny Chairman Mao badges on the staff. The staff understood the sailors' wishes and immediately gave them Chairman Mao badges. The sailors received the badges, each one overjoyed, with smiles on their faces, and thanked the staff repeatedly. At this moment, the shared love for Chairman Mao intertwined the friendship between the staff and the Italian sailors, filling the ship's cabin and deck with a joyful atmosphere and songs.

An elderly sailor in his fifties stood in place, holding the Chairman Mao badge in his hands, carefully examining it, reluctant to leave. The old sailor pulled the staff into his room, first pointing to the Chairman Mao badge and then holding up eight fingers, saying to the staff, "I have eight children. Can you give me eight Mao Zedong badges? I want my whole family to wear Mao Zedong badges." The staff saw that the old sailor loved the great leader Chairman Mao so much and was deeply moved. Therefore, he gave him eight more red and shiny Chairman Mao badges.

Wishing Chairman Mao eternal life

Not long ago, the Huangpu Port Sailors' Club received a letter from a Japanese friend. In this distant letter, the Japanese sailor passionately praised the great leader Chairman Mao, enthusiastically praised the great situation of China's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and thanked the Chinese comrades for giving him Chairman Mao badges and "Quotations from Chairman Mao." At the end, he neatly wrote a line: "Wishing Chairman Mao eternal life!"

This Japanese sailor had recently visited Guangzhou on a ship. During his stay in Guangzhou, he visited the former site of the Peasant Movement Training Institute established by Chairman Mao. Chairman Mao's wisdom and greatness made him deeply admire him, and the great victory of China's Cultural Revolution inspired him greatly. He told the Chinese comrades, "China is great, the Cultural Revolution is great, all thanks to the great Mao Zedong!"

On the ship, he treasured the "Quotations from Chairman Mao" given by the Chinese comrades, reading them whenever he had time, and asking the Chinese comrades about any parts he didn't understand. In this letter, he solemnly requested the Chinese comrades to help him solve the problems he encountered in his studies...

The club members excitedly read this letter, reading it over and over again, and were deeply moved by the sincere feelings of this Japanese friend's boundless love for Chairman Mao.

    金色的太阳照四方
    ——外国朋友无限热爱毛主席的故事
    毛泽东是红太阳
    一天，中国海员同日本海员一块去广州参观游览。在车上，日本海员争着向中国海员要毛主席像章。中国海员挑选了“韶山”、“井冈山”、“瑞金”、“遵义”、
  “延安”等具有纪念意义的毛主席像章，送给他们每人一枚。日本海员接过金光闪闪的毛主席像章，如获珍宝，高兴极了。有的海员把毛主席像章捧在手里，看了又看；有的海员立即把毛主席像章佩戴在胸前，一次又一次，直到佩戴得端端正正的才满意；有的海员把毛主席像章贴在心窝上，久久不想放下。一位海员说：“我得到的像章是红色的，红太阳把我的心照得红红的，我的红心永远向着毛泽东！”另一位海员抢着说：“我得到的像章是金色的，金色的太阳照四方，大海航行不迷失方向。”
    这时，其他的日本海员都朝这两位海员围拢过来，争着看他两人手上金色的、红色的毛主席像章。一位日本海员指着自己胸前的毛主席像章，兴奋而激动地说：“毛泽东是红太阳，红太阳照亮了我们的心。”中国海员见此情景，异常激动，其中的一位情不自禁地说：“对，毛主席是全中国和全世界人民心中最红最红的红太阳。”
    顿时，车上响起了《东方红》、《大海航行靠舵手》的歌声。
    连连高呼毛主席万岁！
    有一次，黄埔港工人在海员俱乐部里开大会。“毛主席万岁！万万岁！”的欢呼声一阵高过一阵。这时，一位非洲海员因事来到俱乐部。当他听到从礼堂里传来“毛主席万岁！”的欢呼声时，立即停下了脚步，全神贯注地聆听着。他听了一会，激动地跑进礼堂去，对中国工人同志说：“我跟你们一起高呼‘毛主席万岁！’”说着，就振臂高呼：“毛主席万岁！毛主席万岁！”一连高呼了十多遍。
    后来，俱乐部的同志才了解到，这位海员出身贫苦，很早就敬仰伟大领袖毛主席。由于他思想进步，曾被反动派说成是“疯子”，受了四年的拘禁。残酷的迫害，使他更加迫切追求真理，更加热爱毛主席。他常常对别人说：“毛泽东，伟大！”
  三次在毛主席像前照相
    不久前，十几位日本海员来到广州农民运动讲习所旧址参观。毛主席当年亲自创办讲习所，领导中国革命的伟大实践，深深地鼓舞着来自远方的客人。他们细致地观看每一件展品，认真听取每一个情况的介绍。
    参观完毕以后，他们来到讲习所正厅毛主席塑像前，兴奋地谈论着。每人的谈话都充满着对毛主席的无限热爱，流露出对毛主席的无限崇敬。这时，一个中年海员指着毛主席塑像对大家说：“我们在毛泽东像前照个相留念吧！”他这一提议，正说出了海员们的心愿，大家一致赞成。有两人一起照的，也有三人或五人合影的。海员们把在毛主席像前照相看作是最大的幸福。
    有一个四十岁左右的海员，虽然与同志们一块儿合照了两张，但他仍不满足，又要单独照一张。他把身上的灰尘拍了又拍，把衣服整了又整，然后才精神抖擞、满脸笑容地站到毛主席塑像前照了相。照完后，他笑着对大家说：“我是第三次在毛主席像前照相了。”
    伟大的形象使他激动
    一个星期天，许多外国朋友在海员俱乐部阅览室里阅读毛主席著作和各种画报。有的人一坐下就是几个钟头不走。
    一位希腊海员在翻阅《人民画报》。只见他时而看看画报，时而看看自己胸前佩戴的毛主席像章，脸上露出幸福的微笑。我工作人员被这动人的情景吸引住了，走近一看，原来这位海员在看画报上的我们伟大领袖毛主席的彩色画像。毛主席身穿绿色军装，神采奕奕，红光满面地站在天安门城楼上，向百万红卫兵小将频频挥手。看到毛主席的伟大形象，这位海员心中深为激动。当他看到我工作人员走到他面前时，便站起来微笑地指着画报上这张单页的毛主席彩色画像，对我工作人员说：“我想要这张毛泽东像！”我工作人员笑着连连点头表示同意。这时，这位海员高兴极了，他拿起毛主席彩色画像，飞快地跑回船上去了。
  全家都戴上毛主席像章
    晚饭后，我港口工作人员来到一艘意大利船上。一上船，十几位意大利海员便跑上来把他们团团围住了。这时，十几双明亮的眼睛都集中到我工作人员那一枚枚红光闪闪的毛主席像章上。我工作人员明白这些海员的心愿，立即把毛主席像章赠送给他们。海员们接过毛主席像章，人人欢天喜地，脸上堆满了笑容，连声向我工作人员感谢。这时，热爱毛主席的共同感情把我工作人员和意大利海员的友谊交织在一起，船舱里、甲板上充满了欢乐的气氛和歌声。
    只见一位五十多岁的老海员站在原地，手里捧着毛主席像章，仔细地端详着，迟迟不肯离去。这位老船员把我工作人员拉到他房间里，先指着毛主席像章，又伸出八个手指，对我工作人员说：“我有八个小孩，能给我八枚毛泽东像章吗？我要让我全家都戴上毛泽东像章。”我工作人员看到这位老海员这样热爱伟大领袖毛主席，非常感动。于是，又送给他八枚红光闪闪的毛主席像章。
    敬祝毛主席万寿无疆
    不久以前，黄埔港海员俱乐部收到一位日本朋友的来信。在这封远方的来信里，这位日本海员满怀激情地歌颂伟大领袖毛主席，热情洋溢地赞扬我国无产阶级文化大革命的大好形势，感谢中国同志送给他毛主席像章、《毛主席语录》。末了，他在信的后面，整整齐齐地写着一行字：“敬祝毛主席万寿无疆！”
    这位日本海员，不久前曾随轮船到过广州。在广州期间，他参观了毛主席创办的农民运动讲习所的旧址。毛主席的英明、伟大，使他无限敬仰，中国文化大革命的伟大胜利，使他感到无限鼓舞。他对中国同志说：“中国伟大，中国文化大革命伟大，全都归功于伟大的毛泽东！”
    在船上，他把中国同志送给他的《毛主席语录》视为珍宝，有空就拿出来阅读，不懂的地方就记下来问中国同志。他在这次来信里又郑重其事地请中国同志帮助他解答学习中遇到的问题……。
    俱乐部的同志们兴奋地阅读了这封信，读了一遍又一遍，越读越被这位日本朋友无限热爱毛主席的真挚感情所感动。
