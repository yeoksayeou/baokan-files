Mao Zedong Thought is the lifeline of Communist Party members. The Chinese Khrushchev, this greatest capitalist-roader within the Party, has always been madly opposed to the great Mao Zedong Thought, and has been extremely hostile to the idea of using Mao Zedong Thought to transform the Party members' ideology. He openly shouted that "if one does not have basic knowledge of Marxism-Leninism, it is more difficult to study Mao Zedong Thought." This is sheer nonsense. He is using a trick here, that is, under the pretext of letting Party members "systematically study" Marxism-Leninism, he is covering up his evil intention of opposing Mao Zedong Thought.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "The core force leading our cause is the Communist Party of China. The theoretical foundation guiding our thinking is Marxism-Leninism." Vice Chairman Lin has given the most profound, comprehensive, correct, and scientific evaluation of the great Mao Zedong Thought. He said: "Mao Zedong Thought is the Marxism-Leninism of the era when imperialism is heading towards comprehensive collapse and socialism is heading towards world victory. Mao Zedong Thought is a powerful ideological weapon against imperialism, and a powerful ideological weapon against revisionism and dogmatism. Mao Zedong Thought is the guiding principle for all the work of the whole Party, the whole army, and the whole country." Mao Zedong Thought is a compulsory course for Communist Party members, it is the Marxism-Leninism that transforms the Party members' ideology, and it is the lifeline of our Communist Party members. We study and master Mao Zedong Thought, which means we study and master contemporary Marxism-Leninism. Communist Party members' unlimited loyalty to Mao Zedong Thought is their unlimited loyalty to Marxism-Leninism and to the Party; not studying Mao Zedong Thought means fundamentally deviating from Marxism-Leninism and betraying the Party. The Chinese Khrushchev maliciously opposes Mao Zedong Thought and Marxism-Leninism, which is the most shameful betrayal of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought! His evil intention is to make our Party deviate from Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, to prevent our Party members from directly mastering Mao Zedong Thought, to make Party members into mediocre individuals without a proletarian political mind, and to open the door wide for him to usurp the Party and the country.

Vice Chairman Lin said: "What attitude one takes towards Mao Zedong Thought is a very important issue. We must focus on the issue of attitude towards Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong Thought." The attitude towards Mao Zedong Thought is the touchstone to test whether one is a Marxist-Leninist or a revisionist; whether one is a revolutionary or a counter-revolutionary. The Chinese Khrushchev madly opposes our study of the great Mao Zedong Thought. He is our most vicious enemy. We must thoroughly criticize him, expose him, and make sure he never rises again.

Vice Chairman Lin is the most loyal and closest to the great Mao Zedong Thought. Our company Party branch takes Vice Chairman Lin as an example, uses Mao Zedong Thought to build the Party branch, and gives the most powerful criticism to the Chinese Khrushchev with practical actions. The Chinese Khrushchev desperately opposes the great Mao Zedong Thought, so we desperately turn Mao Zedong Thought into the soul of Party members; he desperately wants to uproot the lifeline of Party members, so we carry out the small rectification movement of criticizing and repudiating revisionism and selfishness among Party members, and deeply plant the roots of Mao Zedong Thought; he desperately opposes the mass movement of studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought, so we educate Party members to take the lead in studying, executing, propagating, and defending the great Mao Zedong Thought, making Party members into models of studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought, and cultivating Party members into vanguard fighters of the proletariat who are forever loyal to the great leader Chairman Mao. Because we insist on using Mao Zedong Thought to transform the Party members' ideology, Party members have become the steel reinforcement of the company's construction, models of studying Mao Zedong Thought, and leaders of criticizing and repudiating revisionism and selfishness. Many advanced examples have emerged among Party members who are unlimitedly loyal to Chairman Mao and shine with the light of communism. Party members deeply feel that "Mao Zedong Thought is the lifeline of our Communist Party members. Whoever supports Mao Zedong Thought, we are close to them; whoever opposes Mao Zedong Thought, we fight them; we are loyal to Mao Zedong Thought forever and will never waver, and we will never stop using Mao Zedong Thought to transform our ideology for a single moment." Our Party branch is determined to consciously use Mao Zedong Thought to transform the Party members' ideology in the future, to cultivate all Party members into vanguard fighters of the proletariat who are unlimitedly loyal to Chairman Mao, to build the Party branch into a fortress of continuing the revolution under the dictatorship of the proletariat, to build it into a fighting collective that is unlimitedly loyal to Chairman Mao, unlimitedly loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, and unlimitedly loyal to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, and to pass down Mao Zedong Thought from generation to generation.

    毛泽东思想是共产党员的命根子
    沈阳部队某部九连党支部委员会
    中国赫鲁晓夫这个党内最大的走资派，一贯丧心病狂地反对伟大的毛泽东思想，极端仇视用毛泽东思想改造党员的思想。他公然叫嚷什么：“对马克思列宁主义的理论，如果没有基本知识，要学习毛泽东思想就比较困难。”这完全是胡说八道。他在这里玩弄一种障眼法，就是打着让党员“系统学习”马克思列宁主义的幌子，掩盖他反对毛泽东思想的罪恶实质。
    毛主席教导我们：“领导我们事业的核心力量是中国共产党。指导我们思想的理论基础是马克思列宁主义。”林副主席对伟大的毛泽东思想作了最精辟、最全面、最正确、最科学的评价。他说：“毛泽东思想是在帝国主义走向全面崩溃，社会主义走向全世界胜利的时代的马克思列宁主义。毛泽东思想是反对帝国主义的强大的思想武器，是反对修正主义和教条主义的强大的思想武器。毛泽东思想是全党、全军和全国一切工作的指导方针。”毛泽东思想是共产党员的必修课，是改造党员思想的马克思列宁主义，是我们共产党员的命根子。我们学习和掌握毛泽东思想，就是学习和掌握当代的马克思列宁主义。共产党员无限忠于毛泽东思想，就是无限忠于马克思列宁主义，忠于党；不学习毛泽东思想，就是从根本上背离了马克思列宁主义，背叛了党。中国赫鲁晓夫恶毒地把毛泽东思想同马克思列宁主义对立起来，就是对马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想最可耻的背叛！其恶毒用心，就是妄想让我们党背离马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想，不让我们党员直接掌握毛泽东思想，使党员成为没有无产阶级政治头脑的庸人，为他篡党、篡国大开方便之门。
    林副主席说：“对毛泽东思想抱什么态度，是一个很重要的问题。我们就是要抓对毛主席的态度、对毛泽东思想的态度问题。”对毛泽东思想抱什么态度，是检验是马克思列宁主义，还是修正主义；是革命，还是反革命的试金石。中国赫鲁晓夫疯狂地反对我们学习伟大的毛泽东思想，他就是我们最凶恶的敌人，我们坚决要把他批深，批透，批倒，批臭，让他永世不得翻身。
    林副主席对伟大的毛泽东思想最忠最亲。我们连党支部以林副主席为榜样，用毛泽东思想建设党支部，以实际行动给了中国赫鲁晓夫最有力的批判。中国赫鲁晓夫拚命地反对伟大的毛泽东思想，我们就拚命地把毛泽东思想化为党员的灵魂；他拚命地想挖掉党员的命根子，我们就在党员中开展斗私批修的小整风，深扎毛泽东思想的根子；他拚命地反对活学活用毛泽东思想的群众运动，我们就教育党员带头学习，带头执行，带头宣传，带头捍卫伟大的毛泽东思想，使党员成为活学活用毛泽东思想的模范，培养党员成为永远忠于伟大领袖毛主席的无产阶级的先锋战士。由于坚持用毛泽东思想改造党员的思想，党员就成了连队建设的钢筋，学习毛泽东思想的模范，斗私批修的带头人。党员中涌现出许多无限忠于毛主席，处处闪耀着共产主义光辉的先进典型。党员们深有体会地说：“毛泽东思想是我们共产党员的命根子，谁拥护毛泽东思想，我们就和他亲，谁反对毛泽东思想，我们就和他拚；我们忠于毛泽东思想永生永世不动摇，用毛泽东思想改造自己思想一分一秒不停息。”我们党支部决心今后更加自觉地用毛泽东思想改造党员的思想，把党员都培养成为无限忠于毛主席的无产阶级先锋战士，把党支部建设成无产阶级专政下继续革命的战斗堡垒，建设成无限忠于毛主席，无限忠于毛泽东思想，无限忠于毛主席革命路线的战斗集体，一代一代地把毛泽东思想传下去。
