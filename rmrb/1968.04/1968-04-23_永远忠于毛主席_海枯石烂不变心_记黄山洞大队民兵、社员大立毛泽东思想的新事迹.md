Edition: 2

The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants in Huangshandong Brigade, an advanced unit for studying and applying Chairman Mao's works in Guangdong Province, have, through more than a year of tempering in the struggles of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and through the revolutionary furnace of Mao Zedong Thought study classes, raised their loyalty to the great leader Chairman Mao, to great Mao Zedong Thought, and to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line to a new height. "What Chairman Mao advocates, we do; what Chairman Mao criticizes, we correct; what Chairman Mao praises, we learn; what Chairman Mao opposes, we fight"—this has become the guiding principle for their actions.

		Infinite Love for Mao Zedong Thought

The broad masses of militiamen and commune members in Huangshandong hold learning, executing, propagating, and defending Mao Zedong Thought as their most important combat mission. Mao Zedong Thought study classes have sprung up like bamboo shoots after a spring rain, covering every village. The brigade, production teams, and families all hold classes. Men, women, old, and young all eagerly participate. Even children of ten or so and elderly people with white hair are active members of the study classes. Old Cai Quan, a blind man from Dingkeng Production Team, studies Chairman Mao's works diligently. With the help of militiaman Cai Zhao, he can now recite "Three Constantly Read Articles," "Opposing Liberalism," and Chairman Mao's latest instructions during his inspections of North China, Central China, and East China. Once, during a heavy rain, the roads were muddy and slippery, and someone advised him not to go to the study class. He said, "One can eat less food and sleep less, but one cannot study Mao Zedong Thought less. Although I cannot see, as long as I listen to Chairman Mao's words, my heart will be clear, my eyes will be bright, and I will not lose my way on the revolutionary path."

Chen Shouqing, deputy commander of the militia battalion and instructor of the Mao Zedong Thought study class, always listens to or sees Chairman Mao's latest instructions with the highest political enthusiasm and the fastest speed, and organizes everyone to study them. He often carries a quotation board, propagating wherever he goes. He has a low level of education and faces great difficulties in teaching; to overcome these difficulties, every night after work, he immediately lights an oil lamp, opens Chairman Mao's works, and reads them intently. When it is deep night and everyone is asleep, he is still bent over the table, reading and writing word by word. If he encounters a character he doesn't recognize or a place he doesn't understand, he circles it with a pencil and asks others the next day. During the criticism of the counter-revolutionary revisionist fallacies of "exploitation has merits" and "class struggle is extinguished" by the Chinese Khrushchev, he visited every household of old poor peasants, learned about their bitter family histories, and collected living materials as "ammunition" for criticizing revisionism. To prepare and teach well, he often doesn't even have time to eat. The masses all praise him for truly pouring his loyal heart into the work of propagating Mao Zedong Thought.

For the old poor peasant Liao Chunyuan of Dikeng Production Team, a red "loyalty" character and a couplet reading "Ever loyal to Chairman Mao, unchanging hearts despite the drying of seas and the crumbling of rocks" were specially written and hung in her home. Then, she led her entire family to solemnly swear to Chairman Mao: "Chairman Mao, Chairman Mao! The heavens and the earth are not as great as the mighty power of your brilliant thoughts; the rivers and seas are not as deep as your kindness; the heavens and the earth may change, but our red hearts will forever be loyal to you! We are determined to make every second of our lives infinitely loyal to you!" When Liao Chunyuan heard that the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents in Central China and Guangdong, such as Tao Zhu, were trying to restore capitalism in China, she was filled with rage. In large and small criticism meetings, she used her family and village history, stained with blood and tears, to fiercely refute the counter-revolutionary revisionist fallacies of the Chinese Khrushchev and others; with today's happiness, she enthusiastically praised the great leader Chairman Mao. She told everyone that the old society was like pig bile boiled with bitter melon, bitter upon bitter, and the root of bitterness lay in the class exploitation advocated by the Chinese Khrushchev; the new society was like honey mixed with sugar, sweet upon sweet, and the source of sweetness lay in the wise leadership of the great leader Chairman Mao.

Liao Chunyuan loves Chairman Mao more than her own life. During a sudden flood, the water surged into her house in an instant, reaching three feet high. She rushed into the house without hesitation. Someone shouted, "Don't go in, the house is about to collapse!" She replied firmly, "There is Chairman Mao's portrait in the house. Even if it crushes me, I must protect Chairman Mao's portrait!" Just as Liao Grandma took out the portrait of Chairman Mao, the house collapsed with a loud crash. After the flood, she moved into a new residence. She didn't bother with this or that; the first thing she did was to hang the portrait of Chairman Mao upright.

		Breaking Private Interests and Establishing Public Interests to Promote Thought Revolutionization

The militiamen and commune members of Huangshandong Brigade, in the Mao Zedong Thought study classes, all consciously raised the issue of breaking private interests and establishing public interests to the height of the struggle between two classes, two roads, and two lines, closely combining the struggle against selfishness with the criticism of revisionism. Core militiaman Luo Ji has excellent shooting skills. During the Spring Festival, he invited a few young people to go hunting in the mountains and shot a large wild cow. A few young men divided it among themselves. The masses discussed this matter: using public guns, under the pretext of eliminating pests for the people, the wild animals belonged to individuals, wasn't this still the "self" character? Luo Ji heard this and his thoughts were not clear. He thought: the gun is public, the wild animals are naturally born, the holiday is self-controlled, hunting once, running from one mountain peak to another, sweating through one set of clothes after another, working hard, and finally shooting a wild cow, although he got "a mouthful of meat," it was still for the people to eliminate pests, and even if there was a bit of selfishness, it was legal "selfishness." Soon, Luo Ji participated in the production team's Mao Zedong Thought study class. The brilliant thoughts of Chairman Mao, the three heroic figures in "Three Constantly Read Articles," and the self-awareness of comrades in struggling against selfishness opened his mind. He realized that what he said about the holiday hunting belonging to himself was legal "selfishness" was poisoned by the Chinese Khrushchev. The "merging of public and private interests" advocated by the Chinese Khrushchev was a bag of poison, aiming to merge private interests into public interests and create public opinion for the restoration of capitalism. As a militiaman, if he was conquered by the reactionary thoughts of the Chinese Khrushchev such as "merging of public and private interests," how could the gun in his hand serve the interests of the proletariat? Therefore, he consciously struggled against this selfishness four times in the meetings of party members, cadres, and commune members.

Gao Qing, a commune member of Baixia Production Team, three years ago handed over his so-called reclaimed land to the collective. Last year, influenced by the anarchist thinking in society, he missed his reclaimed land again. After participating in the study class, Gao Qing deeply realized that missing the reclaimed land was missing "self-management, self-government, self-reliance," and "four freedoms," and that he had been poisoned by the Chinese Khrushchev. The cunning Chinese Khrushchev wanted to use the "self" character in our minds to secretly open the gap for the restoration of capitalism, which was a very dangerous thing! He said with deep feelings: "Only by combining the struggle against selfishness with the criticism of revisionism can the struggle against selfishness reach a high level, and the criticism of revisionism reach a deep level. Selfishness is the breeding ground for revisionism, and revisionism is the evil fruit of selfishness. Without criticizing revisionism, one cannot see the harm of selfishness, and without struggling against selfishness, one cannot uproot the roots of revisionism." After that, in the study class, he took the lead in exposing and struggling against selfishness, learning from Chairman Mao's teachings, finding the influence of revisionism, and seeing the harm of its development, thereby greatly improving his awareness of line struggle.

Previously, there was a cowherd who, while herding cows, also chopped firewood, and most of the firewood he chopped belonged to himself. When others criticized him, he still had a reasonable answer: "Public and private interests are both considered." After his awareness of line struggle improved, he realized: one pot cannot hold two kinds of water, and one person cannot have two kinds of heart. Public and private interests are like water and fire, incompatible. Let the "merging of public and private interests" go to hell! Therefore, he voluntarily handed over the firewood he chopped to the production team. He said: "If I took these firewood, it would be opening the door for selfishness and self-interest, and there would be the danger of becoming a revisionist!"

		Wholeheartedly Serving the People

The main cadres of the party branch and militia battalion of Huangshandong Brigade are the organizers and leaders of the large-scale Mao Zedong Thought study classes, and they are also models of studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought and implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions. They follow Chairman Mao's teachings of "wholeheartedly serving the people and never leaving the masses for a moment," diligently serving the people, and closely connecting with the masses. They regard propagating Mao Zedong Thought and Chairman Mao's latest instructions as the greatest service to the people and as the first task of connecting with the masses.

Tian Huaguang, the party branch secretary and militia instructor, has been more attentive to connecting with the masses and vigilant against leaving the masses for a moment since he took on the position of standing committee member of the Guangdong Provincial Revolutionary Committee and deputy director of the Huichang Regional Revolutionary Committee. He realized that as long as his thoughts and feelings were slightly distant from the masses, his style would be miles apart from the masses. The first time he participated in the provincial revolutionary committee meeting, as soon as the meeting ended, he hurried back home. The journey from Guangzhou to Huangshandong is three hundred li, but he did not mind the fatigue of the journey, put down his luggage, and the first big thing he did was to visit every household of poor and lower-middle peasants, propagate Chairman Mao's latest instructions, and convey the spirit of the provincial revolutionary committee meeting, until late at night before returning home. The next early morning, he went barefoot, braved the cold wind and fine rain, and worked with the commune members of Huangkeng Production Team to level the fields. Someone saw that he had just returned from Guangzhou and had newly taken on the position of standing committee member of the provincial revolutionary committee, and kindly said, "Huaguang, your work is a basket and a shoulder pole, you can't handle it all, first take care of your work! We will take care of the labor." Tian Huaguang said, "You can take care of the labor, but you can't take care of the revolutionization of the cadres' thoughts." Dingkeng Production Team had relatively intense class struggle and relatively backward work. Tian Huaguang remembered Chairman Mao's teachings of "the more difficult the place, the more one should go, this is what a good comrade does," and went there to set up a work point, mobilizing the masses to hold large-scale Mao Zedong Thought study classes, making the political atmosphere thick and the production enthusiasm high, greatly improving the relationship between cadres and the masses, and making the entire production hot and steaming. The masses unanimously praised, "Tian Huaguang's position has changed, but his ordinary laborer's character has not changed! His thoughts have not changed, his feelings have not changed, and his style has not changed!"

In February of this year, militia battalion commander Li Qing decided to go to the most remote Dashuikeng to set up a work point and hold a study class to propagate and implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions. The residents of Dashuikeng live very scattered. He braved the wind and rain, fearing neither high mountains nor long roads, day and night, visiting every household to propagate Chairman Mao's latest instructions and implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions. Under Li Qing's leadership, the study classes here became better and better, with production teams, natural villages, and fields all holding classes, achieving remarkable results. In late March, Li Qing returned to the brigade headquarters to report on his work. At that time, the provincial revolutionary committee had just issued a call to further implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions and carry out the activities of large-scale study, large-scale propaganda, large-scale inspection, large-scale evaluation, and large-scale summary. After reporting, it was already around four in the afternoon. Someone advised him to go the next day. He said that propagating Chairman Mao's latest instructions required every second, so he braved the cold wind and fine rain, trudging through the muddy and slippery mountain roads, heading straight for Dashuikeng.

		Forever Following Chairman Mao to Make Revolution

The cadres of Huangshandong Brigade, in the Mao Zedong Thought study classes, seriously carried out class education. They took Chairman Mao's teachings of "all revolutionary struggles in the world are for seizing power and consolidating power" as their guide, recalling the bitter experiences of class oppression and national oppression, comparing them with the happiness of today's laboring people standing up and taking power; recalling Chairman Mao's great revolutionary practice of caring for, entering, and connecting with the masses, comparing it with their own attitudes towards the masses and mass movements; recalling the bitterness of being persecuted by the bourgeois reactionary line, comparing it with the sweetness of implementing Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. Based on the thoughts of recalling and comparing, they carried out revolutionary criticism and struggle, fiercely criticizing the Chinese Khrushchev's bourgeois reactionary line of "striking a large area and protecting a small clique" in cadre issues, exposing the Chinese Khrushchev's plot to usurp the party and the government. The broad masses of cadres received profound education and unanimously expressed that they would forever follow Chairman Mao to make revolution, with unchanging hearts despite the drying of seas and the crumbling of rocks.

Zhang Yuanquan, the team leader of Dingkeng Production Team, had once been poisoned by the Chinese Khrushchev and mistakenly thought that being a cadre was a disadvantage. In the Mao Zedong Thought study class, through recalling and comparing, his class consciousness was raised. The bitter and bloody class bitterness and national hatred flooded his mind: generation after generation working as long-term laborers for the landlords, at the age of thirteen, his parents died one after another from poverty and illness. His father could not even afford a coffin when he died, and had to endure the pain of selling his four-year-old younger brother, followed by the sale of his three siblings... After liberation, he stood up politically and economically, became the master, and the party and the people cultivated him from a "sold laborer" into a Communist Party member. These living facts made him realize: power is the lifeline of poor and lower-middle peasants. With the people's power, there is everything for the people; without the people's power, there is nothing for the people. Poor and lower-middle peasants must grasp the printing press for the proletariat. The theory of "being a cadre is a disadvantage" is poisoning by the Chinese Khrushchev's selfishness. Not being a cadre is exactly falling into the Chinese Khrushchev's plot and being deceived by the class enemy. From then on, he removed his selfishness, bravely took up the responsibilities of revolution and production, closely connected with the masses, and mobilized the masses, making the entire team's revolution and production hot and steaming.

    永远忠于毛主席　海枯石烂不变心
    ——记黄山洞大队民兵、社员大立毛泽东思想的新事迹
    广东省活学活用毛主席著作先进单位——博罗县黄山洞大队的广大贫下中农，经过一年多来无产阶级文化大革命的战斗洗礼，经过毛泽东思想学习班革命熔炉的锤炼，对伟大领袖毛主席、伟大的毛泽东思想和毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的忠心，提到了一个新的高度。“毛主席提倡的我们就做；毛主席批评的我们就改；毛主席表扬的我们就学；毛主席反对的我们就斗”，已成为人们行动的准则。
        无限热爱毛泽东思想
    黄山洞的广大民兵、社员，把学习、执行、宣传、捍卫毛泽东思想，当作最重要的战斗任务。毛泽东思想学习班象雨后春笋，遍及每个村庄。大队办，生产队办，家庭办，男女老幼，争先参加。十来岁的小娃娃、白发苍苍的老人，都成为学习班的积极分子。丁坑生产队双目失明的老人蔡权，刻苦学习毛主席著作，在民兵蔡招的帮助下，现在能背熟“老三篇”、《反对自由主义》和毛主席视察华北、中南、华东时的最新指示。一次，天下大雨，路湿泥滑，有人劝他不用到学习班去了。他说：饭可以少吃，觉可以少睡，毛泽东思想不能少学。我虽然眼睛看不见，但只要听毛主席的话，心就明，眼就亮，革命路上就不会迷失方向。
    民兵营副营长、毛泽东思想学习班辅导员陈寿清，每当他一听到、或者看到毛主席的最新指示，就以最高的政治热情、最快的速度，向民兵、社员传达和组织大家学习。他经常背着一块语录板，走到哪里就宣传到哪里。他文化低，讲课有很大困难；为了克服这个困难，每晚收工回来，就立刻点起油灯，打开毛主席著作，聚精会神地读。夜深人静，人们早已熟睡了，他还伏在桌上，一字一句地读着、写着，遇到不认得的字，或不理解的地方，就用铅笔圈上，第二天向别人请教。在批判中国赫鲁晓夫“剥削有功”论、“阶级斗争熄灭”论等反革命修正主义谬论时，他挨家挨户访问老贫农，了解他们苦难的家史，搜集活生生的材料作为批修的“炮弹”。为了备好课，上好课，经常连饭都顾不上吃。群众都称赞他真正把无限热爱毛主席的赤胆忠心，完全倾注在宣传毛泽东思想的工作上。
    对坑生产队老贫农廖春源，专门请人写了一个红彤彤的“忠”字，和“永远忠于毛主席，海枯石烂不变心”的对联，贴在家里，然后带领全家人恭恭敬敬地向毛主席庄严宣誓：“毛主席啊，毛主席！天大地大，不如您的光辉思想威力大；河深海深，不如您的恩情深；天变地变，无限忠于您的红心永不变！我们决心让生命的每分每秒都无限忠于您！”当廖春源听说中国赫鲁晓夫及其在中南和广东的代理人陶铸等企图在中国复辟资本主义的罪行时，她满腔怒火，在大小批判会上，用血泪斑斑的家史、村史，狠狠回击了中国赫鲁晓夫等的反革命修正主义谬论；以今天的幸福，热情赞颂伟大领袖毛主席。她逢人便讲，旧社会好比猪胆煮黄连，苦上加苦，苦根就在中国赫鲁晓夫所鼓吹的“有功”的阶级剥削上；新社会好象蜂蜜调白糖，甜上加甜，甜源就在伟大领袖毛主席的英明领导上。
    廖春源热爱毛主席胜过自己的生命。在一次山洪暴发的时刻，山洪汹涌而来，廖春源的房子顷刻间就进水三尺。只见她不顾一切，直往屋里奔去。有人在喊“别进屋，房子快塌了！”她斩钉截铁地说：“屋子里有毛主席像，就是压死我，也要保护毛主席像！”廖大娘刚把毛主席像捧出来，轰隆一声，房子倒塌了。洪水过后，她搬进新居，不忙这，不忙那，第一件事就是把毛主席像端端正正贴起来。
      破私立公促进思想革命化
    黄山洞大队的民兵和社员，在毛泽东思想学习班里，人人自觉地把破私立公提高到两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线斗争的高度，把斗私与批修紧密结合在一起。基干民兵罗记，有一手好枪法，春节期间邀了几个青年上山打猎，打了一头大山牛，几个小伙子私自分了。群众就这件事，议论开了：拿公家的枪，打着为民除害的名义，打的野兽归个人，还不是“私”字？罗记听了，思想老是不通，他想：枪是公家的，野兽是天生的，假日是自己支配的，打一次猎，跑了一个山头又一个山头，汗水湿了一身又一身，辛辛苦苦，好容易才打了一头山牛，自己虽说得了“一口肉”，但到底还是为民除了害，就是有点私，也是合法的“私”。不久，罗记参加了生产队的毛泽东思想学习班。毛主席的光辉思想，“老三篇”中的三个英雄形象，同志们斗私上“纲”的自觉性，开了他的心窍。他认识到过去说假日打猎所得归己是合法的“私”，那是中了中国赫鲁晓夫的毒。中国赫鲁晓夫贩卖的“公私溶化”论，完全是一包毒药，目的是要以私溶公，为资本主义复辟作舆论准备。自己是民兵，要是让中国赫鲁晓夫的
  “公私溶化”等反动思想所征服，手里的枪杆子怎能为无产阶级利益服务？于是，他自觉地先后四次在党员、干部、社员大会上狠斗了这个私心。
    坳下生产队的社员古清，三年前曾把所谓自己的开荒地交给集体。去年，受社会上无政府主义思潮影响，又怀念起开荒地来了。参加学习班以后，古清深刻地认识到，怀念开荒地，就是怀念“三自一包”、“四大自由”，就是中了中国赫鲁晓夫的流毒。狡猾的中国赫鲁晓夫，想利用我们头脑里的“私”字，偷偷摸摸地打开复辟资本主义的缺口，这是多么危险的事啊！他深有感受地说：“只有斗私和批修紧密结合，斗私才能有高度，批修才能有深度。私是修的温床，修是私的恶果，不批修就看不清私的危害，不斗私就挖不出修的根子。”此后，在学习班里，他带头亮私、斗私，学习毛主席的教导，找修正主义的影响，看发展下去的危害，从而大大地提高了路线斗争觉悟。
    以前，有个看牛的社员，一边看牛，一边砍柴，砍来的柴大都归自己，别人说他，他还满有理由地回答：“公私兼顾嘛！”当路线斗争觉悟提高以后，他认识到：一壶难装两样水，一人难存两样心。公和私，水火不相容。让“公私溶化”论见鬼去吧！于是他自动地把砍来的柴交给生产队。他说：“如果要了这些柴，就是为自私自利思想大开方便之门，就有变修的危险！”
      全心全意做人民的勤务员
    黄山洞大队党支部和民兵营的一些主要干部，是大办毛泽东思想学习班的组织领导者，又是活学活用毛泽东思想、落实毛主席最新指示的模范。他们遵照毛主席的“全心全意地为人民服务，一刻也不脱离群众”的教导，勤勤恳恳地为人民服务，密切联系群众。他们把宣传毛泽东思想和毛主席的最新指示，作为最大的为人民服务，作为联系群众的第一位的工作。
    党支部书记、民兵教导员田华贵，自从担任广东省革命委员会常委和惠阳地区革命委员会副主任以后，就更加注意联系群众，警惕自己一刻也不要脱离群众。他认识到，只要思想感情和群众有一点疏远，作风上就会和群众相差万里。他第一次参加省革命委员会会议，会议刚刚结束，就赶着回家。从广州到黄山洞路程是三百里，他不顾旅途疲劳，放下行李，第一件大事，就是挨家挨户访问贫下中农，宣传毛主席的最新指示，传达省革委会会议精神，一直到深夜才回家。第二天一早，他又赤着脚，顶着冷风细雨，和黄坑生产队社员一起去整田基。有的人见他刚从广州回来，又新任了省革命委员会的常委，好心地说：“华贵，你的工作一箩一担，忙不过来，先忙工作吧！劳动我们包下来。”田华贵说：“劳动活你们可以包下来，但不能把干部的思想革命化包下来。”丁坑生产队阶级斗争比较激烈，工作比较后进。田华贵牢记毛主席“越是困难的地方越是要去，这才是好同志”的教导，就到那里蹲点，发动群众大办毛泽东思想学习班，把政治气氛搞得浓浓的，生产干劲鼓得足足的，干部和群众的关系大改善，整个生产热气腾腾。群众齐声赞誉：“田华贵职务变了，普通劳动者本色没变！思想没变，感情没变，作风也没变！”
    今年二月间，民兵营长李清决定到最偏僻的大水坑蹲点办学习班，宣传和落实毛主席的最新指示。大水坑居住很分散。他冒着风雨，不怕山高路远，不分白天黑夜，挨家挨户去宣传毛主席的最新指示，贯彻毛主席的最新指示。在李清的带动下，这里的学习班越办越好，生产队办，自然村办，田头办，取得了显著的效果。三月下旬，李清回大队部汇报工作。那时正好省革命委员会发出了进一步落实毛主席的最新指示，开展大学习、大宣传、大检查、大评比、大总结的活动的号召。他汇报完，已是下午四点多钟了。有人劝他第二天再去。他说，宣传毛主席最新指示要分秒必争，于是，他冒着寒风细雨，踩着泥泞溜滑的山路，朝大水坑直奔而去。
      永远跟着毛主席干革命
    黄山洞大队的干部，在毛泽东思想学习班中，认真进行阶级教育。他们以毛主席“世界上一切革命斗争都是为着夺取政权，巩固政权”的教导为指针，忆阶级压迫、民族压迫的苦难，比今天劳动人民翻身作主的幸福；忆毛主席关心群众、深入群众、联系群众的伟大革命实践，比自己对待群众和群众运动的态度；忆受资产阶级反动路线迫害的苦，比贯彻执行毛主席无产阶级革命路线的甜。干部们在忆比的思想基础上，开展了革命大批判，狠批中国赫鲁晓夫在干部问题上推行“打击一大片，保护一小撮”的资产阶级反动路线，戳穿中国赫鲁晓夫妄图篡党篡政的阴谋。广大干部受了深刻教育，一致表示，永远跟着毛主席干革命，海枯石烂心不变。
    丁坑生产队队长张燕泉，曾经受了中国赫鲁晓夫的毒害，错误地认为当干部“吃亏”。在毛泽东思想学习班，通过回忆对比，提高了阶级觉悟。充满辛酸血泪的阶级苦、民族恨，又一幕幕浮现在他的脑际：祖祖辈辈给地主打长工，十三岁那年，父母亲接连被贫病夺去了生命。父亲死时连棺材都买不起，只好忍痛把年仅四岁的弟弟卖去，随后，兄妹三人都被卖掉了……。解放后，他从政治上、经济上翻了身，做了主人，党和人民把他从“卖身工”培养成为一个共产党员。这些活生生的事实使他认识到：政权是贫下中农的命根子，有了人民的政权，就有了人民的一切；丧失了人民的政权，就丧失了人民的一切。贫下中农就要为无产阶级掌握印把子。“当干部吃亏”论就是中了中国赫鲁晓夫利己主义的流毒。不当干部，正好中了中国赫鲁晓夫的阴谋诡计，上了阶级敌人的大当。从此，他去掉了私心，勇敢地挑起革命和生产的担子，密切联系群众，深入发动群众，把全队的革命和生产搞得热气腾腾。
