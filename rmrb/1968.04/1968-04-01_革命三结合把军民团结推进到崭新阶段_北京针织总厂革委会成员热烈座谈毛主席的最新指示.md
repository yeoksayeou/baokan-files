The editorial "Revolutionary Committees Are Good" published in the *People's Daily*, *Red Flag* magazine, and *Liberation Army Daily* conveys Chairman Mao's latest instructions. Chairman Mao's latest instructions are like a spring thunder, stirring up the Beijing Knitting Factory. Revolutionary masses enthusiastically shout: Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years!

The factory's revolutionary committee immediately studied Chairman Mao's latest instructions on revolutionary committees. Everyone unanimously agreed that the current national situation is excellent. The establishment of more and more revolutionary committees signifies the continuous victory of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line and the complete failure of the capitalist reactionary line advocated by the Chinese Khrushchev. A ship sailing on the sea relies on its helmsman. At this critical moment, our most beloved great leader Chairman Mao has issued new instructions on revolutionary committees, summarizing the basic experience of establishing revolutionary committees, and pointing out the fundamental direction for building and developing the new revolutionary government. The power structure composed of representatives of revolutionary cadres, military personnel, and revolutionary masses, the "three-in-one combination," has shown its great superiority in strengthening military-civilian unity, consolidating the dictatorship of the proletariat, strengthening the unity of old and new cadres, cultivating successors to the proletarian revolutionary cause, ensuring that the leadership core remains loyal to Chairman Mao, and maintaining close ties with the masses.

During the discussion, representatives of revolutionary cadres and revolutionary masses unanimously agreed that the participation of military representatives in the "three-in-one combination" leadership core is of special importance. They unanimously praised that the military representatives brought the invincible Mao Zedong Thought to the revolutionary committee. Together with the representatives of revolutionary cadres and revolutionary masses, they carried out activities loyal to Chairman Mao among the broad masses of workers, extensively praising Chairman Mao's great wisdom, extolling the boundless power of Mao Zedong Thought, and praising the absolute correctness of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, further arousing the deep proletarian feelings of boundless love for Chairman Mao among the revolutionary masses. Military representatives, together with representatives of revolutionary cadres and revolutionary masses, quickly launched a campaign to study and apply the "Old Three Articles" and Chairman Mao's latest instructions throughout the factory. White Xishan, a member of the factory revolutionary committee and representative of the revolutionary masses, excitedly said: "We learn from the PLA in thousands of ways, in ten thousand ways, but the most important thing is to learn from them the red heart that is infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao. With this red heart, we can withstand any test, face any storm, and forge the new revolutionary committee into a command center that is infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao and fights against the class enemy."

During the discussion, everyone felt from personal experience that the participation of military representatives in the "three-in-one combination" leadership core brought the Three-Eight Style and the Four Firsts of the army to the revolutionary committee. They always put emphasizing proletarian politics first and putting people's ideological revolution first in everything they do. They are good at doing in-depth, detailed, and arduous ideological and political work. They convey Chairman Mao's latest instructions without hesitation, propagate Chairman Mao's latest instructions without distortion, and implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions without compromise. Homing Pu, a member of the factory revolutionary committee and revolutionary cadre, said: "In my work with military representatives, I have deeply felt that political work is the general manager of all work. As long as we seriously study the excellent tradition of the PLA emphasizing proletarian politics, we will definitely be able to cultivate the broad masses of workers in the Knitting Factory into a revolutionary fighting force like the PLA."

During the discussion, military representatives unanimously agreed: The participation of military representatives in the revolutionary committees is the greatest trust that Chairman Mao has in all the officers and soldiers of the army, and it is the brilliant embodiment of Chairman Mao's political military thought in the new situation. Everyone mentioned that as early as the initial period of our army's establishment, the great commander Chairman Mao pointed out: "The fighting of the Red Army is not just for the sake of fighting, but for the sake of propagating to the masses, organizing the masses, arming the masses, and helping the masses build revolutionary political power to fight. Without these goals, the meaning of fighting is lost, and the meaning of the Red Army's existence is lost." We must firmly remember Chairman Mao's great teachings, inherit and carry forward the fine traditions of our army, and take on the glorious task of "propagating to the masses, organizing the masses, arming the masses, and building revolutionary political power." Sun Yi, the chairman of the factory revolutionary committee and military representative, said: "Chairman Mao instructs military representatives to participate in the 'three-in-one combination' revolutionary committee work, which is to further develop military-civilian unity to a new stage. We must cherish, respect, support, and defend the new revolutionary committee." Liu Yunteng, the vice-chairman of the factory revolutionary committee and military representative, said: "Chairman Mao instructs military cadres to participate in the 'three-in-one combination' leadership core, which is also to let us go through the storms of the people's struggle, absorb political nutrients, and do a good job of ideological revolution. We must, with a loyal heart to the great teacher of the proletariat Chairman Mao, strive to study and apply Mao Zedong Thought, transform our worldview, regard the masses as our best teachers, humbly learn from the masses, and master the theory, line, principles, methods, and policies of the proletarian dictatorship revolution. Only in this way can we play the role that military representatives should play and not disappoint the great leader Chairman Mao's greatest care and trust for military comrades."

During the discussion, all members unanimously agreed to follow Chairman Mao's latest instructions, continuously summarize experience, improve work, continue to consolidate and develop revolutionary great unity and the "three-in-one combination," further strengthen military-civilian unity, and make the new revolutionary political power more consolidated and perfect in the waves of class struggle, better leading all the workers of the factory to achieve a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

    革命三结合把军民团结推进到崭新阶段
    北京针织总厂革委会成员热烈座谈毛主席的最新指示
      《人民日报》、《红旗》杂志、《解放军报》重要社论《革命委员会好》，传达了伟大领袖毛主席的最新指示。毛主席的最新指示，象一声春雷，激荡着北京针织总厂。革命群众无比激动地高呼：毛主席万岁，万万岁！
    厂革命委员会立即认真学习了毛主席关于革命委员会的最新指示。大家一致认为，当前全国形势一片大好。越来越多的革命委员会的建立，标志着毛主席的无产阶级革命路线节节胜利，中国赫鲁晓夫推行的资产阶级反动路线彻底破产。大海航行靠舵手。在这关键时刻，我们最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席又发出了关于革命委员会的最新指示，总结了建立革命委员会的基本经验，为建设和发展新生的革命政权指出了根本方向。由革命干部的代表、军队的代表和革命群众的代表组成的“三结合”的权力机构，对加强军民团结，强化无产阶级专政，加强新老干部的团结和培养无产阶级革命事业接班人，保证领导班子永远忠于毛主席，密切联系群众，都显示了它的巨大优越性。
    在座谈中，革命干部的代表和革命群众的代表一致认为，军队代表参加革命的“三结合”领导班子，具有特殊重要的意义。一致赞扬，军队代表把战无不胜的毛泽东思想带到了革委会。他们同革命干部的代表和革命群众的代表一起，在广大职工中开展忠于毛主席的活动，大讲特讲毛主席的英明伟大，大颂特颂毛泽东思想的无穷威力，大赞特赞毛主席革命路线的无比正确，进一步激发了广大革命职工对毛主席无限热爱的深厚的无产阶级感情。军队代表还同革命干部的代表和革命群众的代表一起，很快在全厂掀起了大学大用“老三篇”和毛主席最新指示的热潮。厂革命委员会委员、革命群众代表白喜善同志激动地说：“我们向解放军千学习，万学习，最主要的是向他们学习无限忠于毛主席的一颗红心。有了这颗红心，我们就能够在任何时候都经得起严峻的考验，顶得住大风大浪，就能够把新生的革命委员会锤炼成无限忠于毛主席的、向阶级敌人进行战斗的指挥部。”
    座谈中，大家从切身体会中感受到，军队代表参加革命的“三结合”领导班子，把部队的三八作风、四个第一等优良传统带给了革委会。他们不论做什么工作，总是把突出无产阶级政治放在第一位，把人的思想革命化放在第一位。他们善于做深入、细致、艰苦的思想政治工作。他们传达毛主席最新指示不迟疑，宣传毛主席最新指示不走样，落实毛主席最新指示不打折扣。厂革命委员会委员、革命干部丛泽普同志说：“我在同军队代表共同工作中，更深刻地体会到，政治工作是一切工作的总管。只要我们认真学习解放军突出无产阶级政治的优良传统，就一定能够把针织总厂的广大职工培养成一支象解放军那样革命化的战斗队伍。”
    在座谈中，军队代表一致认为：革命委员会有军队代表参加，这是毛主席他老人家对全军指战员的最大信任，是毛主席政治建军思想在新形势下的光辉体现。大家谈到，早在我军建军初期，伟大统帅毛主席就英明指出：“红军的打仗，不是单纯地为了打仗而打仗，而是为了宣传群众、组织群众、武装群众，并帮助群众建设革命政权才去打仗的，离了对群众的宣传、组织、武装和建设革命政权等项目标，就是失去了打仗的意义，也就是失去了红军存在的意义。”我们必须牢牢记住毛主席的这一伟大教导，继承和发扬我军的优良传统，把“对群众的宣传、组织、武装和建设革命政权”的光荣任务担当起来。厂革命委员会主任、军队代表孙毅同志说：“毛主席指示军队代表参加‘三结合’的革命委员会工作，这是进一步把我们的军民团结发展到一个崭新的阶段。我们对新生的革命委员会，一定要爱护它，尊重它，支持它，保卫它。”厂革命委员会副主任、军队代表刘云腾同志说：“毛主席他老人家指示军队干部参加革命的‘三结合’领导班子，也是让我们到群众斗争的大风雨中见世面，吸取政治营养，搞好思想革命化。我们一定要怀着对无产阶级的伟大导师毛主席的赤胆忠心，努力活学活用毛泽东思想，改造世界观，把群众当成自己最好的老师，虚心向群众学习，掌握无产阶级专政下革命的理论、路线、方针、方法和政策。只有这样，才能起到军队代表应该起的作用，才能不辜负伟大领袖毛主席对军队同志的最大爱护和信任。”
    在座谈中，全体委员一致表示，一定要按照毛主席的最新指示，不断总结经验，改进工作，继续巩固和发展革命的大联合和革命的“三结合”，进一步加强军民团结，使新生的革命政权在阶级斗争的风浪中不断地巩固和完善，更好地领导全厂职工夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利。
