The Revolutionary Committee of Zunhua County in Hebei Province is vigorously promoting class struggle education. It has promptly addressed the issues of "fear, resentment, and difficulty" among grassroots cadres who have stepped forward, enabling them to boldly take on the leadership of spring plowing.

With the help of the People's Liberation Army, the county has rapidly established and strengthened the leadership teams at all levels in rural areas by holding extensive study classes on Mao Zedong Thought and implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions. However, some cadres are hesitant in their work, fearful of various things, unwilling to take the lead, and reluctant to shoulder heavy responsibilities. Some cadres who have made mistakes in the past adopt an attitude of keeping a low profile, speaking less, and interfering less.

In response to this situation, the Revolutionary Committee of Zunhua County, following Chairman Mao's teaching that "holding study classes is a good method, and many problems can be solved in study classes," continues to organize study classes at the county, district, commune, and brigade levels. These classes include new and old cadres, poor and lower-middle peasants, and representatives from revolutionary mass organizations. In these classes, the focus is on conducting in-depth class education. Among the grassroots cadres, remembrance meetings are held, old poor peasants give reports on their hardships, bitter meals are shared, revolutionary martyrs are commemorated, and activities to recall and compare past experiences are organized. These activities guide everyone to vividly recall the hardships of being in a powerless position and the difficulties of obtaining revolutionary power. Through these remembrance activities, many cadres have made vows such as "Remembering class hardships, holding class power firmly, and following Chairman Mao to revolutionize to the end."

Everyone has come to realize that the root of "fear, resentment, and difficulty" is the "self" character. Ultimately, it is the fear of revolutionizing oneself. With the "fear" character, one's back is not straight, one's words are not firm, one's mind is not clear, and one's eyes are not bright, making it impossible to muster the energy to strive for the top. With the "fear" character, one loses revolutionary will and forgets to strengthen proletarian dictatorship at all times. This is the greatest act of forgetting one's roots and the greatest disloyalty to Chairman Mao. Cadres from Da'erli Commune and Yingfang Commune who participated in the study classes said: "If the bourgeoisie wants to seize power, and we drop our responsibilities, we will fall into the trap of the class enemy." Some cadres said: "In the past, the 'fear' character plagued us, and we lived in confusion; now we understand that we are seizing power for the proletariat, acting according to Chairman Mao's instructions, and implementing Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. What is there to fear?"

After eliminating the emotions of "fear, resentment, and difficulty," people's spirits have greatly changed. Many cadres have gone from deciding not to be cadres to deciding to dedicate their lives to the revolution.

In the study classes at various levels, revolutionary criticism is also carried out. The crimes of the bourgeois reactionary line are thoroughly exposed, guiding the broad masses of cadres to elevate their words and deeds to the height of class struggle and line struggle. The more they expose, the clearer they see the bourgeois reactionary line, the deeper their hatred for it, and the clearer the boundaries they draw. The more they expose, the more accurately they grasp their own thoughts and the higher their consciousness. Everyone says: "In the past, Khrushchev harmed us, but now the great leader Chairman Mao has saved us, and the poor and lower-middle peasants have helped us. Now that we have come out to revolution, we must no longer live in confusion. We must, together with the poor and lower-middle peasants, hold power firmly and use it well, and we must not disappoint Chairman Mao's expectations of us."

When solving the cadres' ideological problems, the Revolutionary Committee of Zunhua County emphasizes that leading cadres at all levels should go among the masses, take the lead in criticizing and repudiating revisionism, and each level should grasp the work of the level below. The main leaders of the county Revolutionary Committee and the responsible comrades of the stationed troops personally address active thoughts, while the standing committee members and committee members take responsibility for districts, communes, and brigades. The county Revolutionary Committee has also conducted universal training for the main cadres above the commune level, cultivating a core force to solve the ideological problems of brigade cadres.

Currently, many comrades who previously did not want to be cadres, did not want to be the first in command, and did not dare to lead work boldly have become good cadres who dare to take the lead, vigorously promote the revolution, and vigorously promote production. The entire county presents a scene of cadres and masses uniting as one, striving for a great harvest in agriculture.

    遵化县革委会狠抓阶级斗争教育
    基层干部提高阶级觉悟大胆领导春耕
    各级领导干部到群众中去，带头斗私批修，一级抓一级
    本报讯　河北省遵化县革命委员会，狠抓阶级教育，及时解决基层干部站出来以后的“怕、怨、难”的思想问题，促使他们大胆地挑起领导春耕的重担。
    这个县在解放军的帮助下，通过大办毛泽东思想学习班，落实毛主席的最新指示，迅速建立和健全了农村各级基层领导班子。但是，有些干部工作时缩手缩脚，怕这怕那，不愿当第一把手，不愿挑重担子。有些犯过错误的干部，抱着少出头、少说话、少管事的态度。
    针对这种情况，遵化县革委会遵照毛主席“办学习班，是个好办法，很多问题可以在学习班得到解决”的教导，继续在县、区、公社和大队举办有新老干部、贫下中农和革命群众组织负责人参加的毛泽东思想学习班。在各级学习班上，首先深入进行阶级教育，在基层干部中开忆苦会，请老贫农作忆苦报告，吃忆苦饭，纪念革命烈士，开展回忆对比活动，引导大家大摆处在无权地位之苦，获得革命政权之难。通过忆苦活动，许多干部发出“牢记阶级苦，掌好阶级权，跟着毛主席革命到底”的誓言。
    大家认识到，“私”字是“怕、怨、难”的根子，千怕万怕，说到底，就是怕革自己的命。有了“怕”字，就腰不直，嘴不硬，心不明，眼不亮，就不能鼓足干劲，力争上游。有了“怕”字，就丧失了革命意志，忘记了时时刻刻加强无产阶级专政。这是最大的忘本，是对毛主席最大的不忠。大二里公社和营房公社参加学习班的干部说：
  “资产阶级要夺权，我们撂挑子，就上了阶级敌人的当。”有的干部说：“过去‘怕’字缠身，过了糊涂日子；现在明白了我们是为无产阶级掌权，照毛主席指示办事，执行毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，有啥可怕？”
    消除了“怕、怨、难”情绪，人的精神大改变。许多干部由过去下决心不当干部，到下决心干一辈子革命。
    在各级办的学习班里，还开展革命大批判，大摆资产阶级反动路线的罪状，引导广大干部把自己的一言一行，都提到阶级斗争、路线斗争的高度来认识。越摆，大家对资产阶级反动路线就看得越透，恨得越深，界限划得越清；越摆，大家对自己的活思想就抓得越准，认识越高。大家说：过去中国赫鲁晓夫害了我们，现在伟大领袖毛主席救了我们，贫下中农帮了我们。现在我们站出来革命，再不能过糊涂日子了，一定要同贫下中农一道掌好权、用好权，决不辜负毛主席他老人家对我们的期望。
    遵化县革命委员会在解决干部思想问题的时候，强调各级领导干部到群众中去，带头斗私批修，一级抓一级。县革委会主任、副主任和驻军负责同志亲自抓活思想，常委和委员分工包区、包社、包大队。县革委会还对全县公社以上主要干部进行了普遍训练，为解决大队干部的思想问题培养了骨干力量。
    目前，许多原来不想当干部、不愿当第一把手、不敢大胆领导工作的同志，已成为“敢”字当头、狠抓革命、猛促生产的好干部。全县出现一片干部群众团结一致，夺取农业大丰收的欢腾景象。
