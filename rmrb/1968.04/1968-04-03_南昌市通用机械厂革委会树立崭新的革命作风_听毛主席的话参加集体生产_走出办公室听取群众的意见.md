The Revolutionary Committee of Nanchang General Machinery Factory follows the teachings of the great leader Chairman Mao, frequently entering workshops to participate in labor, humbly listening to the opinions and criticisms of the masses, actively seeking the enthusiastic help of the masses, promoting the thought revolutionization of the leading cadre, and thus better highlighting proletarian politics, implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions, and leading the entire factory's workers to excel in both revolution and production.

The Revolutionary Committee of Nanchang General Machinery Factory was established in December last year. After its establishment, the committee paid great attention to listening to the opinions of the masses to promote its own revolutionization. Whenever Chairman Mao's latest instructions were issued, the committee members immediately went to the workshops to study, discuss, understand, and implement them together with the worker masses, thereby implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions and strengthening the relationship between cadres and the masses. Young worker Li Gen Sheng, after joining the leading cadre of the Revolutionary Committee, both "serves as an official" and "is a common person," insisting on laboring in the team and often telling his mentor, "In the past, you were my mentor, and in the future, you will still be my mentor." The old workers were greatly inspired and often found Li Gen Sheng in their spare time to talk heart-to-heart, helping him overcome shortcomings, conquer difficulties, and encouraging him to study and apply Chairman Mao's works actively, to hold power and use power for the proletariat. The chairman of the Revolutionary Committee, Xiong Li Xin, was busy with affairs for a period, entering the masses less frequently, and developed a bit of "officialdom." Workers from the machinery workshop found him to study Chairman Mao's latest instructions together and said to him, "Some cadres started well in the past, but later their thoughts changed, and they made serious mistakes. Why did they change? An important reason is that they did not listen to Chairman Mao's words, from being detached from the masses to looking down upon and suppressing the masses. We must remember this painful lesson!" Xiong Li Xin was deeply moved and educated. Afterwards, he often went to the workers, and together with the masses, he exposed his private thoughts, humbly sought advice from the masses, and was welcomed by the masses.

The great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "The Party committee must fulfill its leadership tasks by relying on this 'group of people,' fully playing their role.... If this 'group of people' do not act in unison, they will not be able to lead thousands or tens of thousands of people to fight or build." The Revolutionary Committee of Nanchang General Machinery Factory, following Chairman Mao's great teachings, frequently pays attention to listening to the opinions of the masses, strengthening the unity of the leading cadre, and regards it as an important link to consolidate the Revolutionary Committee. In this factory's Revolutionary Committee, two members had disagreements at one time, each doing their own thing in their work, and often conflicting. Some old workers, following Chairman Mao's latest instruction to "each make self-criticism," found them to talk heart-to-heart: "The Revolutionary Committee is established with the support of Chairman Mao. You must listen to Chairman Mao's words, each make self-criticism, and unite well, and must not create factions!" Many workers and other committee members of the Revolutionary Committee also studied Chairman Mao's latest instructions with them, bringing problems to learn, helping them realize that if the members of the leading cadre do not unite, they cannot hold power well for the proletariat, which is disloyal to Chairman Mao, guiding them to expose their private thoughts, fight their private thoughts, "everything from the interests of the people, not from the interests of individuals or small groups." These two members finally sat together, each making serious self-criticism, eliminating estrangement, and strengthening unity. After this incident, the Revolutionary Committee more frequently borrowed the strength of the masses to promote the unity between the members of the Revolutionary Committee, between new and old cadres, making the leading cadre's thoughts unified and actions consistent, becoming a strong fighting command center for the entire factory.

    南昌市通用机械厂革委会树立崭新的革命作风
    听毛主席的话参加集体生产  走出办公室听取群众的意见
    据新华社南昌二日电　南昌市通用机械厂革命委员会成员，遵照伟大领袖毛主席的教导，经常深入车间参加劳动，虚心听取群众的意见和批评，主动争取群众的热情帮助，促进领导班子的思想革命化，从而更好地突出了无产阶级政治，落实毛主席的最新指示，领导全厂职工把革命和生产搞得很出色。
    南昌通用机械厂革命委员会，是在去年十二月成立的。革委会成立后，就很注意倾听群众意见，来促进自己的革命化。每逢毛主席的最新指示传来，革委会的委员们都立即深入到车间，同工人群众一起学习、讨论、领会、贯彻，既落实了毛主席的最新指示，又密切了干群关系。青年工人李根生参加革委会领导班子以后，“既当‘官’，又当老百姓”，坚持在班组劳动，经常对他的师傅说：“过去你是我的师傅，今后，你还是我的师傅。”老工人很受鼓舞，经常在业余时间找李根生谈心，帮助他克服缺点，战胜困难，勉励他活学活用毛主席著作，为无产阶级掌好权、用好权。革命委员会主任熊立新有段时间忙于事务，深入群众少了一些，有了点“官气”。金工车间的工人就找他一起学习毛主席的最新指示，对他说：“过去有的干部开始很好，以后思想变了，犯了严重错误。为什么会变呢？一个重要的原因，就是因为不听毛主席的话，从脱离群众，发展到瞧不起群众、压制群众。一定要牢记这个沉痛的教训！”熊立新深受感动和教育。以后，他经常到职工群众中去，和群众一起亮私斗私，虚心向群众求教，受到了群众的欢迎。
    伟大领袖毛主席教导我们：“党委要完成自己的领导任务，就必须依靠党委这‘一班人’，充分发挥他们的作用。……如果这‘一班人’动作不整齐，就休想带领千百万人去作战，去建设。”南昌市通用机械厂革命委员会遵照毛主席的这一伟大教导，经常注意听取群众意见，增强领导班子的团结，把它作为巩固革命委员会的重要一环。这个厂的革委会中有两个成员一度因为相互间有些意见，工作中各行一套，经常顶牛。一些老工人遵照毛主席要“各自多做自我批评”的最新指示，找他们谈心：“革命委员会是毛主席支持我们建立起来的。你们要听毛主席的话，各自多做自我批评，搞好团结，不能闹派性呀！”许多工人和革委会其他委员还和他们一起带着问题学习毛主席的最新指示，帮助他们认识到领导班子的成员之间闹不团结就不能为无产阶级掌好权，就是对毛主席的不忠，引导他们自己亮私斗私，“一切从人民的利益出发，而不是从个人或小集团的利益出发”。这两个成员终于坐到一起，各自认真作自我批评，消除了隔阂，增强了团结。这件事以后，革命委员会更加经常地借群众的力量来促进革委会成员之间、新老干部之间的团结，促使领导班子思想统一、行动一致，成为全厂坚强的战斗指挥部。
