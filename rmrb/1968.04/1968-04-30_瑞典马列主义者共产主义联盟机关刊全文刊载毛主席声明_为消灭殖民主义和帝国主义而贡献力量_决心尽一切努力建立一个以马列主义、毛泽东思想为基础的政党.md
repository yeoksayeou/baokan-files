The Swedish Marxist-Leninist Communist League's official publication, "Star Fire," recently published in full Chairman Mao's statement supporting the struggle of American blacks against violence. It also published a commentary, enthusiastically praising Chairman Mao's statement.

The commentary pointed out that Chairman Mao's great statement not only analyzed the struggle of American blacks but also provided a comprehensive, profound, and clear analysis of the global revolutionary situation.

The commentary in "Star Fire" said: All excellent revolutionaries should study the statement recently issued by Comrade Mao Zedong. This statement not only provides a comprehensive, profound, and very clear analysis of the struggle of American blacks but also of the global revolutionary situation and prospects. It is extremely important for every revolutionary to thoroughly grasp and understand what Comrade Mao Zedong said in the statement and to act accordingly.

The commentary said that underestimating the significance of the struggle of American blacks and the current speed of the global revolution would lead to serious errors in revolutionary work. The commentary pointed out that it is necessary to support the struggle of American blacks in action because this struggle weakens the number one enemy of the people of the world, American imperialism.

The commentary said that in the statement supporting the struggle of American blacks against violence, Chairman Mao predicted that the complete collapse of colonialism, imperialism, and all exploitative systems is not far off. Chairman Mao's words are not only an inspiration but also a call to prepare for the Swedish Marxist-Leninists. "It calls on us to prepare to contribute to the elimination of colonialism, imperialism, and all exploitative systems, and to lead our people in the struggle to overthrow the dictatorship of the monopolistic capitalists and establish the dictatorship of the proletariat."

The commentary concluded: "Preparation means establishing a fighting party that is based on Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought and rooted among the masses. Let us strive to build such a party!"

    瑞典马列主义者共产主义联盟机关刊全文刊载毛主席声明
    为消灭殖民主义和帝国主义而贡献力量
    决心尽一切努力建立一个以马列主义、毛泽东思想为基础的政党
    新华社斯德哥尔摩二十八日电　瑞典马列主义者共产主义联盟机关刊物《星火》最近全文刊登了毛主席支持美国黑人抗暴斗争的声明，并且发表评论，热情赞扬毛主席的声明。
    评论指出，毛主席这一伟大声明不仅对美国黑人的斗争，而且对世界革命形势，都作了全面、深刻和明确的分析。
    《星火》的评论说：一切优秀的革命者都应当学习毛泽东同志最近发表的声明。这个声明不仅对美国黑人的斗争，而且对世界革命的形势和前途，都作了全面的、深刻的和十分明确的分析。彻底地掌握和理解毛泽东同志在声明中所说的话，并在行动中照着这样做，对每一个革命者来说是极为重要的。
    评论说，如果低估了美国黑人斗争的意义和低估了当前世界革命的发展速度的话，将会导致在革命工作中犯严重错误。评论指出，一定要在行动上支持美国黑人的斗争，因为这一场斗争削弱了全世界人民的头号敌人美帝国主义。
    评论说，毛主席在支持美国黑人抗暴斗争的声明中预言，殖民主义、帝国主义和一切剥削制度的彻底崩溃已经为期不远了。毛主席的话对于瑞典马克思列宁主义者不仅是一个鼓舞，而且也是要求作好准备的号召。“号召我们作好准备为消灭殖民主义、帝国主义和一切剥削制度贡献力量，并领导我国人民进行推翻垄断资本主义者的专政和建立无产阶级专政的斗争”。
    评论最后说：“作好准备意味着建立一个以马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想为坚实基础并且扎根于群众之中的战斗性的政党。让我们尽一切努力建立这样的党吧！”
