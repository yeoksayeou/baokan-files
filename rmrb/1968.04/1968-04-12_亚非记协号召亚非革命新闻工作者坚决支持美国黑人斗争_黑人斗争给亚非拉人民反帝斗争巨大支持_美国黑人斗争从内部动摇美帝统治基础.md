The Secretariat of the Asian-African Journalists' Association issued a statement today, resolutely supporting the just struggle of American blacks against racial oppression.

The statement pointed out that the violent actions sweeping across the entire United States clearly prove that the anti-violence struggle of American blacks is flourishing. Through their own painful experiences, American blacks have come to realize that revolutionary violence must be used to counter revolutionary violence. Today, in 110 cities across the United States, blacks have risen up to challenge American imperialism. This struggle is shaking the foundations of American imperialism from within.

The statement said that Chairman Mao, in his statement "Support the Just Struggle of the American Blacks Against U.S. Imperialism's Racial Discrimination," has aptly predicted the rapid sharpening of class contradictions in the United States. Chairman Mao pointed out:

"The rapid development of the struggle of American blacks is a manifestation of the increasingly sharp class struggle and national struggle within the United States, causing increasing unease among the American ruling class. 'The evil system of colonialism and imperialism, which rose with the enslavement and trafficking of blacks, will also come to an end with the complete liberation of the black race.'"

The statement said that at present, the struggle of American blacks is surging, the U.S. aggressors in Vietnam are bound to suffer defeat, and the capitalist world is facing financial and monetary crises. All these developments are causing increasing unease among the American ruling class, accelerating the downfall of U.S. imperialism.

The Secretariat of the Asian-African Journalists' Association expressed in the statement its firm belief that the increasingly flourishing and militant struggle of American blacks will surely achieve final victory. This will provide great support to the struggle of the peoples of Asia, Africa, and Latin America against imperialism led by the United States. The statement calls on Asian-African revolutionary journalists to resolutely support the militant struggle of American blacks against exploitation and national oppression, to fully expose and condemn the counter-revolutionary and aggressive nature of U.S. imperialism, and to further support the revolutionary struggle of the peoples of all countries against the world's number one enemy, U.S. imperialism.

    黑人斗争给亚非拉人民反帝斗争巨大支持
    美国黑人斗争从内部动摇美帝统治基础
    新华社十一日讯　亚非新闻工作者协会书记处今天发表声明，坚决支持美国黑人反对种族压迫的正义斗争。
    声明指出，目前席卷整个美国的暴力行动清楚地证明，美国黑人的抗暴斗争正在蓬勃发展。美国黑人通过自己的痛苦经验教训，已经认识到，反革命的暴力必须以革命的暴力来对付。今天，在美国的一百一十个城市里，黑人们起来向美帝国主义进行挑战了。这场斗争从美国内部动摇了美帝国主义的基础。
    声明说，毛主席在他的《支持美国黑人反对美帝国主义种族歧视的正义斗争的声明》里，已恰当地预言美国阶级矛盾的迅速尖锐化。毛主席指出：
      “美国黑人斗争的迅速发展是美国国内阶级斗争和民族斗争日益尖锐化的表现，引起了美国统治集团日益严重的不安。”“万恶的殖民主义、帝国主义制度是随着奴役和贩卖黑人而兴盛起来的，它也必将随着黑色人种的彻底解放而告终。”
    声明说，当前，美国黑人的斗争日益高涨，美国侵略者在越南必然遭到失败，资本主义世界发生财政金融危机，这一切更加引起美国统治集团日益严重的不安，加速了美帝国主义的灭亡。
    亚非记协书记处在声明中表示坚信，美国黑人日益蓬勃发展的富有战斗性的斗争，一定会取得最后胜利。这将给亚非拉人民反对以美国为首的帝国主义的斗争以巨大的支持。声明号召亚非革命新闻工作者坚决支持美国黑人富有战斗性的、反对剥削和民族压迫的斗争，充分揭露和谴责美帝国主义的反革命侵略本质，进一步支持各国人民反对世界头号敌人美帝国主义的革命斗争。
