The U.S. imperialists, who have been battered in the Vietnam War and have consumed a large number of troops, are now facing a severe shortage of reserves due to their intensified suppression of the black people's struggle for liberation at home.

According to a recent report by the United Press International, the U.S. Army's strategic reserve, which was already understaffed due to the Vietnam War, has now been depleted due to the need to suppress the black people's struggles in Chicago, Baltimore, and Washington. It is revealed that the U.S. Army has always required that the strategic reserve "must have at least five fully staffed divisions and several regiments or brigades, composed of regular troops that have been tested in battle. This reserve can be deployed to any part of the world at any time" to carry out aggression.

However, due to the heavy losses suffered by the U.S. aggressor forces in the South Vietnamese battlefield, the continuous need to replenish casualties, the strategic reserve has been reduced to three divisions, two-thirds of a division, and one regiment, totaling approximately 60,000 people. Now, 15,000 of them are being used to suppress the black people's struggles, leaving only about 45,000 who can be immediately deployed.

As for the U.S. Army, according to the United Press International, there are only 800,000 troops in the United States. Among them, 250,000 are in the training stage, 100,000 are instructors, and the rest are mostly "on missions and cannot be immediately reassigned to combat tasks." Therefore, the number of troops that can truly be used for combat is pitifully small.

### 侵越战争损兵折将　镇压黑人穷于应付  美国后备兵力严重空虚

    侵越战争损兵折将　镇压黑人穷于应付
    美国后备兵力严重空虚
    本报讯　在侵越战争中被打得焦头烂额，消耗了大量兵力的美帝国主义，现在又由于加紧镇压国内黑人抗暴斗争，后备兵力已陷于严重空虚。
    据美国合众国际社最近报道，美国陆军战略预备队本来已经由于侵越战争“而处于不满员状态”，现在因为要镇压芝加哥、巴尔的摩和华盛顿的黑人斗争，“这支预备队已经空虚”。据透露，美国陆军一向要求“战略预备队起码要有五个满员师和若干团或旅，由经过战斗考验的正规军队组成，这支预备队可以随时运往世界上的任何地点”去进行侵略。
    但是，由于美国侵略军在南越战场上大量被歼灭，不断需要增加炮灰补充，战略预备队已经减少到了三个师以及一个师的三分之二和一个团，总共约六万人。现在，其中的一万五千多人用于镇压黑人斗争，剩下能随时动用的，只有四万五千人左右。
    至于美国陆军，据合众国际社透露，在美国国内也只有八十万人。其中二十五万人正在受训阶段，有十万人是教官，其余的人大部分也“有任务在身，没法随时调去执行作战任务”。因此能真正用来打仗的就少得可怜了。
