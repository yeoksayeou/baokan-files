Unquenchable Fire and Unstoppable Flood: The American Black Struggle Against Violence Spreads to Over Sixty Cities

Johnson Administration Panics, Deploys 40,000 Troops in Frenzied Suppression — Black Masses Fight Bravely with High Morale

BEIJING, April 8 (Xinhua) — Despite the frenzied suppression by the American ruling class, the struggle of American black masses against violence has spread like wildfire across the country. According to preliminary statistics, from the evening of April 4 to April 7, more than sixty American cities, large and small, have witnessed black armed struggles against violence of varying scales.

The black masses' brave fight over three consecutive days has struck fear into the hearts of the American ruling class. They have viciously deployed nearly 40,000 federal troops, who have marched into Washington, Baltimore, and Chicago, where the struggles are most intense. Additionally, they have ordered the National Guard of ten states and the District of Columbia to join or stand by for the criminal suppression, attempting to extinguish the flames of the black struggle against violence. However, the black masses in various places have not been intimidated and continue to fight bravely.

In the reactionary ruling center of American imperialism, Washington, the panicked authorities have shamelessly declared a curfew starting from 4 PM on April 7, banning blacks from going out. They have also sealed off the black neighborhoods with 13,600 troops, set up dense checkpoints at major traffic intersections within the city, and filled the windows and rooftops of government buildings with armed soldiers. Western news agencies have admitted that Washington has become "a fortified camp." Even under such circumstances, gunshots from black snipers could still be heard in the city on the night of April 7. Meanwhile, the struggle has spread to Arlington, a suburb across the river from the city, where eighteen large fires were started overnight. The military and police authorities in Washington are anxious, believing that the "danger" in Washington has not yet passed.

In the sixth-largest city in the United States, Baltimore, despite the authorities hastily deploying 6,000 National Guard soldiers on April 6 to suppress the black struggle against violence, the black masses' morale has only grown stronger. On April 7, they smashed one white exploiter's shop and pawnshop after another in the city and set fire to one place after another. The city's fire chief exclaimed that the intensity of the fires was unprecedented since the great fire of 1904. Seeing the situation deteriorate, the governor of Maryland, where the city is located, hastily requested that the federal government airlift 2,000 troops into the city that night to strengthen the suppression; at the same time, he declared the entire city to be under "martial law and a state of emergency."

In the steel center of the United States, Pittsburgh, blacks have been bravely fighting since the afternoon of April 5. The authorities have exclaimed that the local 1,700 police officers can no longer control the situation in the city, so they hastily deployed 2,200 National Guard troops into the city on the afternoon of April 7 for armed patrols and declared a citywide curfew. However, the black masses are fearless and continue their brave struggle. That night, they threw homemade Molotov cocktails to burn down many white exploiter's shops; many large fires broke out in the city. The black masses also threw bricks and glass bottles from rooftops and windows at the military and police who were rampaging in the black neighborhoods. The struggle continued throughout the night. A spokesman for the Pittsburgh mayor's office lamented the serious situation, saying, "Only God knows when this area will stabilize."

On the same day, in Memphis and Nashville, Tennessee, Gainesville, Florida, Oakland, California, Richmond, Virginia, and Des Moines, Iowa, black armed struggles against violence broke out in each of these cities, and black snipers fought back against the reactionary military and police, striking fear into their hearts.

    扑不灭的烈火  挡不住的洪流
    美国黑人抗暴斗争遍及六十多个城市
    约翰逊政府慌忙出动四万军队疯狂镇压　黑人群众斗志昂扬英勇战斗
    新华社八日讯　华盛顿消息：不顾美国统治集团的疯狂镇压，美国黑人群众的抗暴斗争犹如熊熊烈火，连日来以燎原之势向美国各地迅速蔓延；据初步统计，从四日晚上开始到七日为止，总共已经有六十多个美国大小城市爆发了规模不等的黑人武力抗暴斗争。
    黑人群众连续三天的英勇斗争使美国统治集团吓破了胆。他们穷凶极恶地出动了将近四万名联邦正规军，分别开进了斗争最激烈的华盛顿、巴尔的摩和芝加哥三个城市，另外还下令十个州和哥伦比亚特区的国民警卫队分别投入了罪恶的镇压活动或待命参加镇压，妄图把黑人抗暴斗争的烈火扑灭下去。但是各地黑人群众并没有被吓倒，他们仍在英勇地坚持战斗。
    在美帝国主义的反动统治中心华盛顿，丧魂落魄的统治当局悍然宣布从七日下午四时起实行“宵禁”，禁止黑人上街，并且用一万三千六百名正规军封锁了黑人区，在市内各交通要道口布置了密集的岗哨，连政府大厦的窗口和楼顶上都满是荷枪实弹的兵士。西方通讯社在报道中承认，华盛顿已经成了“一个武装的兵营”，就在这样的情况下，七日晚间仍然可以听到黑人狙击手的枪声。在这同时，斗争还扩大到了同市区隔河相望的郊区阿林顿，一夜之间在那里燃起了十八处大火。华盛顿的军警负责人惴惴不安地认为，目前华盛顿的“危险”还并没有过去。
    在美国第六大城市巴尔的摩，尽管统治当局在六日匆匆调进了六千名国民警卫队士兵镇压黑人的抗暴斗争，但是黑人的斗志却更加昂扬。七日，他们在市内砸烂了一座又一座白人剥削者的商店和当铺，点燃了一处又一处大火。这个城市的消防队长惊呼，火势之猛是一九○四年大火灾以来所不曾见过的。这个城市所在的马里兰州州长见势不妙，慌忙要求联邦政府在当天晚上空运了两千名正规军进入市区，加强镇压；同时还宣布全城处于“戒严和危机状态”。
    在美国钢铁中心匹兹堡，黑人自五日下午就开始了英勇斗争。统治当局惊呼当地一千七百名警察已控制不住市内的局势，于是匆忙在七日下午调了两千二百名国民警卫队进城，在市内武装巡逻，并宣布全城戒严。但是黑人群众毫不畏惧，继续进行英勇斗争。当晚，他们投掷自制燃烧瓶焚毁许多白人剥削者的店铺；市内燃起了许多起大火。黑人群众还从屋顶上、楼窗口向闯入黑人区肆虐的军警投掷砖瓦、玻璃瓶。斗争一直继续到深夜。匹兹堡市长办公室发言人哀叹局势“严重”，“只有上帝知道这个地区什么时候得以稳定下来”。
    同一天，在田纳西州的孟菲斯和纳什维尔，佛罗里达州的根斯维尔，加利福尼亚州的奥克兰，弗吉尼亚州的里士蒙，依阿华州的得斯梅因等城市都分别爆发了黑人的武力抗暴斗争，黑人狙击手打得反动军警胆战心惊。（附图片）
