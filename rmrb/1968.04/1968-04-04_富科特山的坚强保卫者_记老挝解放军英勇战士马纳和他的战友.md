For over three years, the American puppets, the right-wing Laotian army, have launched numerous ferocious attacks on the gateway to the Xepone Plain in Khammouane Province—Phu Kout Mountain. They attempted to seize this mountain area as a springboard to invade the Xepone Plain. However, Phu Kout Mountain still stands proudly as a victor on the frontline of the Laotian people's struggle against American aggression and for national salvation.

The majestic Phu Kout Mountain stands tall like a giant because it has steadfast defenders—the Laotian People's Liberation Army. Mana and the platoon he commands are a shining banner among the soldiers defending Phu Kout Mountain.

On March 14, 1966, the American puppet army exerted all their might to temporarily seize one of the three hilltops in the Phu Kout Mountain area—Hill Number 3. However, by the afternoon of the 19th, Mana and his platoon were still firmly defending a section of the trench on the slope of Hill Number 3. They were less than fifty meters away from the enemy's position, posing a serious threat to the enemy on the hill.

At that time, Mana's platoon had only four men left. After five days of intense battle and the enemy's tight blockade, they had lost contact with their superiors. However, Mana and his three comrades still tenaciously held their position in the trenches on Hill Number 3. During these five days and nights, they had nothing to eat or drink. They were visibly emaciated, but their eyes shone with a firm belief in ultimate victory. On the sixth day, Mana and his comrades finally reestablished contact with the battalion headquarters and received an exhilarating message: the battalion decided to launch a counterattack that night to retake Hill Number 3.

At around nine o'clock that evening, a platoon of the Liberation Army, under the cover of darkness, quietly made their way along the trenches to Mana's position. After listening to the report, the platoon leader said to Mana, "Your mission is complete. Now, your platoon should immediately withdraw to the rear for rest." These words were like a bolt from the blue to Mana. He anxiously said, "Platoon leader, we cannot rest at this time. We want to fight until we retake Hill Number 3." The three other soldiers in Mana's platoon also chimed in, "We have enough strength to fight ten more times." Their bold words expressed their firm resolve. The platoon leader was deeply moved and agreed to their earnest request.

At three o'clock the next morning, the battle to retake Hill Number 3 began. Bullets of hatred rained down on the enemy's positions. The startled enemy was in disarray. Mana led his platoon in a surprise attack from the enemy's flank. They forgot their hunger and fatigue, bravely charging into the enemy's ranks. Mana took the lead, jumping into the Number 1 trench adjacent to the enemy's position, and fiercely fired and threw several grenades at the enemy. Seizing the opportunity when the enemy was caught off guard, Mana charged forward, killing a group of enemies, and captured a section of the enemy's frontline trench. The other Liberation Army soldiers followed closely behind.

After losing the frontline trench, the enemy concentrated their machine guns and other weapons, firing at the trench in an attempt to retake it. At this moment, the soldiers heard Mana's resolute voice: "Hold the fighting positions, fire vigorously, block the enemy's machine guns, and push the enemy back!" At the same time, another group of Liberation Army soldiers charged from the enemy's front, joining Mana in a fierce assault on the enemy, driving them back step by step until they retreated to the mountaintop. However, the fighting positions on the mountaintop were soon captured by the Liberation Army. The stubbornly resisting enemies were killed on the spot; the remaining enemies fled in disarray. The Liberation Army completely recaptured Hill Number 3. While pursuing the fleeing enemies, Mana unfortunately sacrificed his life for the cause of Laotian people's liberation. As he lay dying, he still remembered to encourage his comrades: "Hold on to Phu Kout Mountain, hold on..." (According to Xinhua News Agency)

    富科特山的坚强保卫者
    ——记老挝解放军英勇战士马纳和他的战友
    三年多来，美国走狗老挝右派军队向川圹省查尔平原的门户——富科特山发动了多次的疯狂进攻，企图侵占这个山区，作为它们进犯查尔平原的跳板。但是，富科特山依然以胜利者姿态，傲然屹立在老挝人民抗美救国斗争的最前线。
    雄伟的富科特山之所以能够象巨人般地巍然屹立，是因为它有着坚强的保卫者——老挝人民解放军。马纳和他率领的一个班，就是守卫富科特山人民解放军中的一面光辉旗帜。
    一九六六年三月十四日，美国走狗军队用尽了九牛二虎之力，才暂时占领了富科特山区三个高地中的一个——三号高地。但是，直到十九日下午，马纳率领的一个班仍然坚守着三号高地山腰间的一段战壕。他们离敌人的阵地不满五十米。他们象一把锋利的匕首，严重地威胁着山上的敌人。
    当时，马纳的班仅剩下四个人。五天来的激烈战斗和敌人的严密封锁，使他们同上级暂时失去了联系。但是，马纳和其他三个战友仍然顽强地坚守在三号高地的战壕里。在这五个昼夜里，他们没有吃的、也没有喝的。人都明显地消瘦了，但从他们炯炯有神的眼睛里，可以看出他们对最后胜利抱着坚定的信念。第六天，马纳同他的战友终于同营部取得了联系，并得到了一个令人振奋的消息：营部决定在当天晚上发动反攻，夺回三号高地。
    当晚九时许，一排解放军在夜色的掩护下，沿着战壕悄悄地来到了马纳所在的战壕。排长听完汇报之后，对马纳说：“你们的任务完成了，现在你们班要立即撤回后方，好好休息。”排长的话，对马纳来说，简直是一个晴天霹雳。他焦急地说：“排长，我们不能在这个时候休息。我们要战斗，直到夺回三号高地。”马纳身旁的三个同班战友也异口同声地说：“我们有足够的力量进行连续十次的战斗。”豪迈的语言表达了战士们的坚定决心。排长听了心中异常激动，就一口答应了他们的恳切要求。
    次日凌晨三时，收复三号高地战斗的枪声打响了。仇恨的子弹象雨点一样射向敌人阵地。从梦中惊醒的敌人慌作一团。马纳率领的班从敌人侧面发动突击。他们忘记了饥饿和疲劳，勇猛地插入敌阵。马纳一马当先，跳进了紧靠敌军阵地的一号战壕，向敌人猛烈扫射和扔出了几颗手榴弹。趁敌人被打得抬不起头来的机会，马纳一跃冲过去，击毙了一批敌人，占领了敌军前沿阵地的一段战壕，其他的解放军战士也紧紧跟上，接踵而至。
    敌人在前沿阵地的战壕失守之后，集中了机枪和其他武器向战壕猛扫，企图夺回战壕。这时，战士们听到了马纳班长的铿锵有力的声音：“坚守战斗工事，猛烈开火，堵住敌人的机枪口，把敌人压下去！”这时，另一路解放军也从敌人的正面冲了上来，同马纳一起，猛袭敌人，并向敌人发起冲锋，打得敌军节节败退，最后退到了山顶。但是，山顶上的战斗工事不久也被解放军攻克了。负隅顽抗的敌人当场被击毙；残敌落荒而逃。解放军完全收复了三号高地。马纳在追击逃敌时，不幸牺牲，为老挝人民的解放事业流下了最后一滴血。临牺牲时，他还念念不忘地勉励着战友们：“坚守住富科特山，坚守……”　（据新华社）
