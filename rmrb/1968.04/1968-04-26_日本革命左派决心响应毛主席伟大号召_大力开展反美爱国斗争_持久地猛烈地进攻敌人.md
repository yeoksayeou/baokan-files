According to a report by Xinhua News Agency on April 24, the Oriental News Agency reported: The Japanese revolutionary left wing enthusiastically hailed Chairman Mao's statement supporting the struggle of American blacks against violence and expressed their determination to respond to Chairman Mao's great call, launching a powerful anti-American patriotic struggle.

The leader of the left wing of the Japanese Communist Party's Yamaguchi Prefecture Committee, Tsuda Hirotoshi, said, "Chairman Mao has made a correct and scientific analysis of the struggle of American blacks, clearly pointing out the direction of this struggle and its important position in the world revolution."

Tsuda emphasized: "Chairman Mao is the greatest Marxist-Leninist of our time. His thesis that the thorough collapse of colonialism, imperialism, and all exploitative systems is not far off greatly inspires the people of the whole world."

The leader of the left wing of the Japanese Communist Party's Fukuoka Prefecture Committee, Nakano Yoshizo, said: "The great Chairman Mao pointed out that the American imperialists used counter-revolutionary violence to brutally murder the American black pastor and non-violent advocate Martin Luther King. This incident once again teaches us that no matter how weak imperialism becomes, its nature will not change, and it will not voluntarily withdraw from the historical stage. This incident also teaches us that the revolutionary people of the world should not pin their hopes for liberation on the 'wisdom' of imperialism and 'peace talks' with imperialism, but must rely on the resolute struggle of the people." Nakano said: "We must respond with concrete actions to Chairman Mao's historic call: 'The people of the world, unite more closely, and launch a prolonged and ferocious attack on our common enemy, American imperialism, and its running dogs!' We will form a broader anti-American patriotic united front, and more powerfully carry on the struggle to abolish the Japan-U.S. 'Security Treaty,' overthrow the rule of American imperialism and the Japanese reactionaries, and build a new Japan that is independent, democratic, peaceful, and neutral."

The leader of the Keishu District Committee of the Japanese Communist Party (Revolutionary Faction), Tsuzura Hiroshi, said: "Chairman Mao's brilliant statement not only illuminates the path for the heroic American blacks and the American working class, but also points the way for the anti-American struggle of the people of the whole world."

The actor Fujii Yoshiaki of the Japanese Revolutionary Theater Wheel said that we must quickly and widely spread Chairman Mao's great statement among the Japanese working people. The "Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team" composed of Wheel actors will actively spread this statement.

    据新华社二十四日讯　据东方通讯社报道：日本革命左派热烈欢呼毛主席支持美国黑人抗暴斗争的声明，并表示决心响应毛主席的伟大号召，大力开展反美爱国斗争。
    日本共产党山口县委员会（左派）领导人津田浩俊说，毛主席对美国黑人的斗争作了正确的科学分析，清楚地指出了这场斗争的方向和明确了它在世界革命中的重要地位。
    津田强调说：“毛主席是当代最伟大的马克思列宁主义者。他关于殖民主义、帝国主义和一切剥削制度的彻底崩溃已经为期不远了的论点，极大地鼓舞着全世界人民。”
    日本共产党福冈县委员会（左派）领导人中野礼造说：“伟大的毛主席指出，美帝国主义者用反革命的暴力残酷地杀害了美国黑人牧师、非暴力主义者马丁·路德·金。这件事再一次教育我们，不管帝国主义变得怎样虚弱，它的本性是决不会改变的，它决不会自动退出历史舞台。这件事还教育我们，世界革命人民决不应该把自己解放的希望寄托在帝国主义的‘明智’上和同帝国主义举行‘和平谈判’上，而必须依靠人民的坚决斗争。”中野说：“我们必须以实际行动来响应毛主席的这一具有历史意义的号召：‘全世界人民更紧密地团结起来，向着我们的共同敌人美帝国主义及其帮凶们发动持久的猛烈的进攻！’我们将组成更广泛的反美爱国统一战线，更有力地把废除日美‘安全条约’、推翻美帝国主义和日本反动派的统治和建立一个独立、民主、和平与中立的新日本的斗争进行到底。”
    日本共产党（革命派）京筑地区委员会的绪方宽说：“毛主席的光辉声明，不仅照亮了英雄的美国黑人和美国工人阶级应走的道路，并且还给全世界人民指出了反美斗争的方向。”
    日本革命剧团齿轮座的演员藤井义昭说，我们必须把毛主席的伟大声明迅速地广泛地传播到日本劳动人民群众中去。齿轮座演员们组成的
  “毛泽东思想宣传队”将积极地传播这个声明。
