A few days ago, our workshop director just stepped forward to lead the work. Once, he assigned me to work in the fifth group of the fitting section, but since it didn't suit my wishes, I firmly refused to comply. I repeatedly went to the workshop revolutionary committee until I was transferred to the fourth group before I stopped. Everyone criticized me for this, but I was still unhappy.

During this time, when we were drafting the workshop's "Seize the Revolution, Promote Production Agreement" in our small group meeting, comrades exposed various manifestations of anarchism, discussed the harms of anarchism, and dug out the roots of anarchism, which gave me a great education. With the enthusiastic help of comrades, I realized that many revolutionary comrades of the proletariat rebel against the bourgeois reactionary line and the revisionist enterprise management system, all for the sake of defending Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. However, my deliberate refusal to comply with the correct leadership of the revolutionary committee is absolutely not a revolutionary spirit of rebellion, but a manifestation of anarchism. In the small group meeting, comrades also praised a group of model revolutionary comrades who strictly followed proletarian revolutionary discipline. Our group's senior worker Zhang Liangzhao, in the early days of the Cultural Revolution, firmly stood on the side of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line and fiercely rebelled against the bourgeois reactionary line. After taking power, he was able to maintain and consolidate the proletarian revolutionary discipline, becoming a model for seizing the revolution and promoting production. He firmly stood on the side of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, wholeheartedly for the socialist construction of the country, truly a model for me to learn from.

After my awareness was raised, I actively checked my anarchist thoughts from the previous period with comrades, expressing my determination to learn from revolutionary old workers, consciously follow the proletarian revolutionary discipline, obey the correct leadership, and definitely contribute my strength to seizing the revolution and promoting production.

    向革命老工人学习　做抓革命促生产闯将
    修机车间钳工　袁有地
    前些时间，我们车间的主任刚站出来领导工作。有次他分配我在钳工五组干活，因为不合我的心意，我就坚决不服从，三番五次地找车间革委会，直到把我调到钳工四组才罢休。为这事大伙儿批评我，我还不服气。
    在这次制订车间“抓革命，促生产公约”的小组会上，同志们摆了无政府主义的种种表现，论了无政府主义的危害，挖了无政府主义的根源，使我受到了很大教育。在同志们的热情帮助下，我认识到许多无产阶级革命派同志造资产阶级反动路线的反，造修正主义企业管理制度的反，完全是为了捍卫毛主席的无产阶级革命路线。而我对革命委员会的正确领导故意不服从，这绝不是什么革命造反精神，而是无政府主义的表现。在小组会上，同志们还表扬了一批模范执行无产阶级革命纪律的革命派。我们组的老师傅张良照，在文化大革命初期，坚定地站在毛主席的无产阶级革命路线一边，大造资产阶级反动路线的反。掌权以后，又能维护和巩固无产阶级的革命纪律，成为抓革命促生产的模范。他坚定地站在毛主席的无产阶级革命路线一边，一心为着国家的社会主义建设，真是我学习的榜样。
    认识提高了，我主动向同志们检查了前段存在的无政府主义思想，表示决心向革命老工人学习，自觉遵守无产阶级的革命纪律，服从正确领导的指挥，一定要为抓革命促生产贡献自己的力量。
