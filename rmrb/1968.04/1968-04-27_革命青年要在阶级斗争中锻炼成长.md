Editor's Note: Our great leader Chairman Mao has shown boundless concern for the youth, pointing out the sole correct path for the growth of the younger generation. Chairman Mao has repeatedly instructed us: "Youth should place a firm and correct political orientation in the first place." "The successors of the proletarian revolutionary cause are produced in the midst of the masses' struggle and are tempered in the great winds and storms of revolution."

With China's Khrushchev at the helm, the biggest handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party, in order to achieve their goal of restoring capitalism, have been doing everything possible to win over the younger generation, deceiving youth into detaching themselves from proletarian politics, from the three great revolutionary movements, and from the workers and peasants, in an attempt to make them into the successors of the bourgeoisie.

The broad masses of revolutionary youth, holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, have resolutely fought against China's Khrushchev's counter-revolutionary revisionist line on youth. The articles published in this newspaper expose and criticize China's Khrushchev's crimes of opposing political command and advocating business command. At the same time, they point out that only by always acting according to Chairman Mao's instructions and firmly taking the road of emphasizing proletarian politics can the youth movement advance in the correct direction.

Politics is the commander of all work and also the commander of youth work. Revolutionary youth must study and apply Chairman Mao's works, emphasize proletarian politics, grasp class struggle, carry out a great criticism, and in the great winds and storms of revolution temper themselves into successors of the proletarian revolutionary cause.

Our great leader Chairman Mao has shown great concern for the growth of the youth, entrusting the future of the motherland and the destiny of humanity to us revolutionary youth. Chairman Mao teaches us: "The successors of the proletarian revolutionary cause are produced in the midst of the masses' struggle and are tempered in the great winds and storms of revolution."

Following Chairman Mao's great teachings, tens of millions of revolutionary youth across the country, with great revolutionary aspirations, holding the red book of revolution, go to the factories, to the countryside, to the borders, to where the motherland needs them most, taking the road of integrating with the workers and peasants, growing up vigorously in the three great revolutionary movements, fighting against class enemies, fighting against nature, and fighting against the earth.

The broad masses of youth in our Sijiazhuang are the same as youth across the country. Under the nurturing of Mao Zedong Thought, they have thrown themselves into the revolutionary struggle, weathering storms and gaining experience, gradually growing up. Many youth have become active elements in studying and applying Chairman Mao's works and have been selected as instructors for the masses to study Chairman Mao's works. More than half of the newly elected brigade leadership are youth.

China's Khrushchev hates to see tens of millions of revolutionary youth advancing along the revolutionary road indicated by Chairman Mao and is terrified of it. He strives to oppose Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, vigorously propagating the theory of the extinction of class struggle, and does not allow revolutionary youth to engage in the class struggle of the proletariat against the bourgeoisie and all exploiting classes. He rants on about how "the exploiting classes have been overthrown," and "our Party members, League members, and revolutionary intellectuals must work hard to study, seriously delve into their professions, and master various specialized technologies and scientific knowledge," and so on. China's Khrushchev attempts to make the youth into confused individuals who do not understand class struggle, turning them into his "tame tools" for restoring capitalism. How sinister his methods are!

Revolutionary youth armed with Mao Zedong Thought will never listen to China's Khrushchev's nonsense!

Take our Sijiazhuang, with only eighty households, for example. Class struggle has never stopped. During the agricultural cooperativization movement, class enemies openly shouted: "Each person joining the cooperative must invest fifty yuan, no money, no cooperative." The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary youth, displaying the spirit of poor but hard-headed people, firmly took the road of cooperativization, smashing the class enemies' plots. After cooperativization, a handful of class enemies again ranted on about how "the village is not big, one born on a mud platform, one grown on a mud platform, working on a piece of mud, one team distributing grain, the poor and rich are one family." They confused class lines, corrupted and swayed cadres, spoke for landlords and rich peasants, and illegally changed the class status of landlords and rich peasants. During the Four Clean-ups movement, they launched counterattacks and retaliations, striking at the poor and lower-middle peasants. Especially in this unprecedented proletarian cultural revolution, class enemies were extremely arrogant. They deceived a part of the masses, spreading rumors and slanders, denying the achievements of Sijiazhuang under the leadership of Chairman Mao and the Party, defaming revolutionary masses as "class enemies," and disrupting revolutionary great unity and the revolutionary three-in-one combination. The revolutionary youth and poor and lower-middle peasants of our village, following Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, engaged in a tit-for-tat struggle with class enemies, thoroughly smashing the class enemies' arrogant attacks. Facts have educated us: class enemies are not willing to admit defeat. They are always ready to launch counterattacks and retaliations and always ready to restore capitalism.

The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has greatly raised the political awareness of the broad masses of youth and poor and lower-middle peasants. As people's class consciousness has been raised, the entire village's agricultural production has seen a new leap. In 1967, the wheat season exceeded the annual procurement task. Despite the autumn floods, more than two hundred mu of late corn was not harvested, but the total grain output was still at the level of 1966. This year, the broad masses of youth and poor and lower-middle peasants have even more vigor. Especially recently, through the establishment of Mao Zedong Thought study classes, people's spiritual outlook has been completely renewed. The attendance rate of community members has reached 100%. More than a thousand mu of large fields in the entire village have been irrigated once, and more than six hundred mu of wheat fields are being intensively managed. We are determined and confident to make another leap in production this year.

The closer the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution gets to complete victory, the sharper and more complex the class struggle becomes. We revolutionary youth must always study and apply Chairman Mao's works, integrate with the workers and peasants, constantly reform our worldview, and temper and grow in the fiery class struggle.

    革命青年要在阶级斗争中锻炼成长
    河北省革命委员会委员宝坻县司家庄大队党支部副书记  邢燕子
　　编者按　我们伟大领袖毛主席对青年无限关怀，为青年一代的成长指出了唯一正确的道路。毛主席谆谆教导我们：“青年应该把坚定正确的政治方向放在第一位。”“无产阶级革命事业的接班人，是在群众斗争中产生的，是在革命大风大浪的锻炼中成长的。”
    以中国赫鲁晓夫为首的党内最大的一小撮走资派，为了达到他们复辟资本主义的目的，却千方百计地争夺青年一代，诱骗青年脱离无产阶级政治，脱离三大革命运动，脱离工农群众，妄图使青年成为资产阶级的接班人。
    广大革命青年高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，同中国赫鲁晓夫的反革命修正主义青年运动路线进行了坚决的斗争。本报发表的这几篇文章，揭露和批判了中国赫鲁晓夫反对政治挂帅、鼓吹业务挂帅的罪行。同时指出了，只有永远照毛主席的指示办事，坚定地走突出无产阶级政治的道路，才能使青年运动朝着正确的方向前进。
    政治是一切工作的统帅，也是青年工作的统帅。革命青年必须活学活用毛主席著作，突出无产阶级政治，狠抓阶级斗争，开展革命的大批判，在革命的大风大浪中把自己锻炼成为无产阶级革命事业的接班人。
    我们伟大领袖毛主席极为关怀青年的成长，把祖国的前途、人类的命运寄托在我们革命青年的身上。毛主席教导我们：“无产阶级革命事业的接班人，是在群众斗争中产生的，是在革命大风大浪的锻炼中成长的。”
    全国亿万革命青年遵照毛主席的伟大教导，胸怀革命壮志，手捧红彤彤的革命宝书，到工厂去，到农村去，到边疆去，到祖国最需要的地方去，走同工农相结合的道路，在三大革命运动中，同阶级敌人斗，同天斗，同地斗，茁壮地成长起来。
    我们司家庄的广大青年跟全国青年一样，在毛泽东思想的哺育下，投身到革命斗争中，经风雨，见世面，逐渐成长起来。很多青年成为活学活用毛主席著作的积极分子，被选为群众学习毛主席著作的辅导员。新选的大队领导班子，就有一多半是青年。
    中国赫鲁晓夫对亿万革命青年沿着毛主席指引的革命道路前进，恨得要死，怕得要命。他极力同伟大领袖毛主席的无产阶级革命路线相对抗，大肆宣扬“阶级斗争熄灭”论，不让革命青年投入无产阶级反对资产阶级和一切剥削阶级的阶级斗争。他胡说什么：“剥削阶级被打倒了”，“我们的党员、团员和革命知识分子，都要下苦工学习，认真钻研业务，很好地掌握各种专门技术和科学知识”，等等。中国赫鲁晓夫妄图使青年成为不懂阶级斗争的糊涂虫，变成他复辟资本主义的“驯服工具”。手段何其毒辣！
    用毛泽东思想武装起来的革命青年，绝不听中国赫鲁晓夫的这些鬼话！
    就拿我们仅有八十户的司家庄来说吧，阶级斗争就始终没有停止过。在农业合作化运动中，阶级敌人公开叫嚷：“入社每人要投款五十元，没钱甭想入社。”广大贫下中农和革命青年，发扬穷棒子硬骨头精神，坚决走合作化的道路，粉碎了阶级敌人的阴谋。合作化以后，一小撮阶级敌人又胡说什么：“庄又不大，一个土台生的，一个土台长的，一块土上干活，一个队分粮，穷富是一家人。”他们混淆阶级阵线，拉拢腐蚀干部，替地主富农说话，非法给地主富农改变成份。在四清运动中，他们进行反攻倒算，打击贫下中农。特别是在这场史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命中，阶级敌人极为嚣张。他们蒙蔽一部分群众，编造流言蜚语，否定司家庄在毛主席和党领导下取得的成绩，把革命群众污蔑为“阶级异己分子”，破坏革命的大联合和革命的三结合。我们村的革命青年和贫下中农，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，同阶级敌人展开了针锋相对的斗争，彻底粉碎了阶级敌人的猖狂进攻。事实教育了我们，阶级敌人是不甘心失败的。他们时刻想反攻倒算，时刻想复辟资本主义。
    无产阶级文化大革命，使广大青年和贫下中农的政治觉悟有了很大提高。由于人的阶级觉悟提高了，全村的农业生产也出现了新的跃进。一九六七年麦季就超额完成了全年的征购任务。秋涝成灾，二百多亩晚玉米颗粒未收，但是，粮食总产量仍相当于一九六六年的水平。今年以来，广大青年和贫下中农的劲头更足了。特别是最近通过大办毛泽东思想学习班，人的精神面貌焕然一新。社员出勤率达到百分之百。全村一千多亩大田已经普浇一遍，六百多亩麦田正在加强管理。我们有决心有信心使今年生产再来个跃进。
    无产阶级文化大革命愈接近全面胜利，阶级斗争就愈尖锐复杂。我们革命青年一定要永远活学活用毛主席著作，同工农群众相结合，不断改造世界观，在火热的阶级斗争中锻炼成长。
