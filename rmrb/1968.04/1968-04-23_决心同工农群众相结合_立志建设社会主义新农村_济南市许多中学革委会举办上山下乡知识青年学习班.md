Many high schools in Jinan have held Mao Zedong Thought study classes for urban youth going to the countryside with the help of military training teams. These classes have raised high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, starting from class education to promote the ideological revolution of urban youth going to the countryside, and have strengthened their resolve to face the countryside and take the road of uniting with workers and peasants. More than 200 urban youth have already settled in the countryside as the first batch this year, and another 200 are ready to go. They proudly say: "With Chairman Mao's wave of the hand, we march forward. We are determined to unite with workers and peasants for life and contribute our strength to building a socialist new countryside."

Tens of thousands of high school and junior high school graduates in Jinan, tempered by the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, have greatly enhanced their proletarian consciousness. They follow Chairman Mao's great teachings: "The countryside is a vast world where one can accomplish great things." They have expressed their determination to go to the countryside and strive to become a new type of socialist-aware and cultured peasants.

To thoroughly criticize the fallacies spread by the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents in Jinan regarding the issue of urban youth going to the countryside, and to further promote the ideological revolution of urban youth going to the countryside, the Jinan Revolutionary Committee and many high school revolutionary committees, following Chairman Mao's instruction to "hold study classes, which is a good method and many problems can be solved in study classes," have held Mao Zedong Thought study classes for urban youth going to the countryside before they go to the countryside. The Jinan Revolutionary Committee has held two sessions, and various schools have held one or two or three sessions. In these study classes, the military training teams and revolutionary committees of various schools first help the urban youth going to the countryside to study and apply Chairman Mao's brilliant works "Old Three Articles," "The Direction of the Youth Movement," and Chairman Mao's latest series of instructions. The urban youth going to the countryside study one of Chairman Mao's viewpoints, criticize one of Chinese Khrushchev's fallacies, and fight one of their own selfish thoughts. They have studied Chairman Mao's teaching: "How do we judge whether a young person is a revolutionary or not? What is the criterion? There is only one criterion, that is, whether he is willing to unite with the broad masses of workers and peasants and whether he actually does so." They have concentrated on criticizing the reactionary fallacies propagated by Chinese Khrushchev and his agents in the educational field, such as "All occupations are inferior, only reading is superior" and "Suffer a small loss to gain a big advantage." The youth say, following Chairman Mao's words and uniting with the masses of workers and peasants is the only correct path for revolutionary youth. We will surely respond to the call of the great leader Chairman Mao, thoroughly change our worldview, go to the countryside, and become socialist-aware and cultured laborers.

The Mao Zedong Thought study classes in various schools follow Chairman Mao's instruction to "never forget class struggle" and focus on class struggle and line struggle education for the urban youth going to the countryside. The study classes organize the urban youth going to the countryside to visit heroism exhibition halls and the clay sculpture "Rent Collection Hall"; to pay tribute to revolutionary martyrs' graves; to invite active soldiers in studying Chairman Mao's works, revolutionary old workers to talk about their family history and factory history, and to recall bitterness and sweetness; to invite urban youth who have already settled in the countryside to give reports and share their experiences of going to the countryside. At the same time, some schools have also exposed the plots of class enemies to sabotage the urban youth going to the countryside. In this way, the class consciousness of the graduates has been enhanced, and they have further recognized the great significance of insisting on going to the countryside and uniting with workers and peasants. Now, more and more urban youth in Jinan are eager to go to the countryside, creating a new atmosphere.

    决心同工农群众相结合  立志建设社会主义新农村
    济南市许多中学革委会举办上山下乡知识青年学习班
    据新华社济南电　济南市许多中学的革命委员会，在军训团的帮助下，最近纷纷举办上山下乡知识青年毛泽东思想学习班。这些学习班高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，从阶级教育入手，促进上山下乡知识青年思想革命化，坚定了他们面向农村，走与工农相结合道路的决心。今年第一批上山下乡的知识青年二百多人已到农村安家落户，第二批二百多人正整装待发。他们豪迈地说：“毛主席挥手我前进。我们决心一辈子和工农结合，为建设社会主义新农村贡献自己的力量。”
    济南市数万名高中初中毕业生，经过无产阶级文化大革命的锻炼，无产阶级觉悟大大提高，他们遵照毛主席的伟大教导：“农村是一个广阔的天地，在那里是可以大有作为的。”纷纷表示要到农村去，立志做一代有社会主义觉悟、有文化的新型农民。
    为了彻底批臭中国赫鲁晓夫及其在济南的代理人在知识青年上山下乡问题上所散布的修正主义谬论，从而进一步促进上山下乡知识青年的思想革命化，济南市革命委员会和许多中学的革命委员会，遵照毛主席“办学习班，是个好办法，很多问题可以在学习班得到解决”的教导，在知识青年下乡前，陆续举办了上山下乡知识青年毛泽东思想学习班。济南市革委会举办了两期，各学校举办了一期或两三期。在这些学习班里，各校军训团和革委会首先帮助上山下乡的知识青年活学活用毛主席的光辉著作“老三篇”、《青年运动的方向》和毛主席的一系列最新指示。上山下乡知识青年学习毛主席的一个观点，批判中国赫鲁晓夫的一条谬论，斗一次自己的私心。他们学习了毛主席“看一个青年是不是革命的，拿什么做标准呢？拿什么去辨别他呢？只有一个标准，这就是看他愿意不愿意、并且实行不实行和广大的工农群众结合在一块”的教导，集中地批判了中国赫鲁晓夫及其在教育战线上的代理人宣扬的“万般皆下品，唯有读书高”、“吃小亏，占大便宜”的反动谬论。知识青年们说，听毛主席的话，与工农群众相结合，是革命的知识青年应该走的唯一正确的道路。我们一定响应伟大领袖毛主席的号召，狠狠改造自己的世界观，上山下乡，做一个有社会主义觉悟的有文化的劳动者。
    各校的毛泽东思想学习班遵循毛主席“千万不要忘记阶级斗争”的教导，针对上山下乡知识青年的活思想，狠抓阶级斗争和路线斗争教育。学习班组织上山下乡的知识青年参观英雄事迹展览会和泥塑《收租院》，瞻仰革命烈士墓；请解放军学习毛主席著作积极分子、革命老工人讲家史、厂史，忆苦思甜；请已经在农村安家落户的知识青年做报告，谈上山下乡的体会。与此同时，有的学校还揭发了阶级敌人破坏知识青年上山下乡的阴谋活动。这样，就提高了毕业生的阶级觉悟，更加认识到坚持上山下乡与工农相结合的重大意义。济南市上山下乡知识青年在毛泽东思想学习班学习后，绝大多数人进一步坚定了与工农相结合，努力建设社会主义新农村的决心。现在，整个济南已经出现越来越多的知识青年要求上山下乡的新气象。
