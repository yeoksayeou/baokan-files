Not a "Dragon," but a Big Worm

Iron Road Corps Hard-Boned Warrior Zhang Chunyu

After watching the reactionary film *Storm*, I was extremely indignant!

In this reactionary film, the creators, through a character unrelated to the film's plot—the fisherman drummer—sang anti-party songs to glorify the disgraced, anti-party, and military coup plotter Peng Dehuai, thereby maliciously defaming and attacking our great leader Chairman Mao. Just as the film depicted Peng Dehuai's alter egos, Luo Dacheng and Qiu Jin, rallying troops to revive Peng Dehuai's "leftist" opportunist line, the fisherman drummer suddenly appeared, singing, "The sun rises with a little red, the river leaps with a dragon" and so on. The film blatantly praises the Chinese Khrushchev's agent in the military, the vanguard of Peng Dehuai's anti-party and military coup, as a "dragon," portraying him as the people's "savior" and the "leader" of the revolution. This nakedly exposes the creators' insane desire to defame and oppose our great leader Chairman Mao.

Pah! What is Peng Dehuai? Strip him bare, and Peng Dehuai is full of "rebellious bones"; he is a thorough and through anti-Chairman Mao old counter-revolutionary.

The film describes the "Pingjiang Uprising," which is the old capital Peng Dehuai used to oppose the revolution. Peng Dehuai's cronies also distort this history, portraying him as the revolutionary "leader" of the Pingjiang region. However, if we look at history, it is clear that the revolutionary forces in the Pingjiang region grew under Chairman Mao's personal cultivation, and the revolutionary movement in the Pingjiang region developed under Chairman Mao's direct care. At that time, Peng Dehuai was merely a battalion commander of the Nationalist reactionary army suppressing the Pingjiang peasant movement. Due to his loss of power in officialdom, to find a way out, he joined the Pingjiang Uprising with the motive of "investing," infiltrating the revolutionary army. Clearly, Peng Dehuai was never the "leader" of the Pingjiang people.

Since Peng Dehuai infiltrated the revolutionary ranks, he has stubbornly adhered to a bourgeois reactionary stance, promoting "left" and "right" opportunist lines, opposing Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. After national liberation, with the support and protection of the Chinese Khrushchev, Peng Dehuai even more brazenly promoted a set of capitalist and revisionist military lines, madly opposing the party's leadership, opposing the prominence of proletarian politics, and opposing the study and application of Chairman Mao's works. He also recruited traitors, formed factions, eliminated dissenters, and assembled a counter-revolutionary "military club," attempting to turn the People's Liberation Army, which Chairman Mao personally created, into a tool for restoring capitalism.

Peng Dehuai is not a "dragon" at all but a thorough and through big worm. Therefore, Chairman Mao and the Central Committee dismissed Peng Dehuai's position and removed his job at the Lushan Conference. Peng Dehuai and his cronies, along with their backer the Chinese Khrushchev, are not willing to accept their failure and are always attempting to reverse their verdict. In 1962, the Chinese Khrushchev stirred up a reversal wind, shouting that Peng Dehuai's anti-party platform "is largely in line with the facts" and "does not count as an error." Thus, they released the reactionary film *Storm*, using the fisherman drummer's mouth to dress up Peng Dehuai, this historical worm that has always opposed Chairman Mao, as a "dragon" to parade around. The film's creators also use the fisherman drummer to sing, "Seeing you off to the roadside, your kindness will never be forgotten. Friends and fellow villagers in our hearts are bright, separated by mountains and waters, forever looking at each other," to summon the spirits of the dismissed Peng Dehuai; shouting, "In wind and waves, you sail the ship, I hold the torch to wait for your return," eagerly hoping that Peng Dehuai will "revive the dynasty" and carry out a capitalist restoration.

"The golden monkey wields the thousand-pound rod, the jade sky clears the dust for ten thousand miles." The reactionary film *Storm* and the big worm Peng Dehuai have long been exposed and paraded by hundreds of millions of workers, peasants, and soldiers. Now we must continue to sweep the Chinese Khrushchev and his big worms and small worms into the garbage heap of history, and denounce them as stinking dog shit! Let Mao Zedong Thought shine forever over the five continents and four seas!

    不是“一条龙”，是条大爬虫
    铁道兵硬骨头战士　张春玉
    看了反动影片《怒潮》，真是气愤极了！
    在这部反动影片中，炮制者通过一个同影片故事情节毫不相干的人物——渔鼓老人，大唱反党的歌曲，来美化被罢了官的反党篡军大野心家彭德怀，从而恶毒地贬低和攻击伟大领袖毛主席。正当影片表现出彭德怀的化身罗大成、邱金拉起队伍重现当年彭德怀推行“左”倾机会主义路线的时候，影片中的渔鼓老人忽然跳了出来，高唱什么：“太阳出来一点红，大江跃起一条龙”呀！等等，影片公然把中国赫鲁晓夫在军内的代理人、篡军反党的急先锋彭德怀吹捧为“一条龙”，把他吹捧成人民的“救星”、革命的“领袖”人物，这就赤裸裸地暴露了炮制者丧心病狂地贬低和反对我们伟大领袖毛主席的反革命祸心。
    呸！彭德怀算什么东西！剥开皮来看，彭德怀浑身都是“反骨”，是个地地道道的一贯反毛主席的老反革命。
    影片描写的“平江起义”，是彭德怀借以反对革命的老血本，彭德怀的死党们也歪曲这段历史，把他打扮成平江地区的革命“领袖”。但是只要翻开历史来看，很清楚，平江地区的革命力量是在毛主席亲自培育下成长起来的，平江地区的革命运动也是在毛主席直接关怀下发展起来的。而彭德怀在当时不过是一个镇压平江农民运动的国民党反动军队的团长。由于他在官场斗争中失势，为了找出路，才抱着“入股”的动机，参加平江起义，混进了革命部队。可见，彭德怀根本不是平江人民的什么“领袖”。
    彭德怀从混进革命队伍以来，一直顽固坚持资产阶级反动立场，推行“左”、右倾机会主义路线，反对毛主席的革命路线。在全国解放以后，彭德怀在中国赫鲁晓夫的支持和庇护下，更加变本加厉地推行一整套资本主义、修正主义的军事路线，疯狂反对党的领导，反对突出无产阶级政治，反对活学活用毛主席著作。他还招降纳叛，结党营私，排除异己，拼凑反革命的“军事俱乐部”，妄图把毛主席亲手缔造的中国人民解放军变成为复辟资本主义的工具。
    彭德怀根本不是什么“龙”，而是一条道道地地的大爬虫。因此，毛主席和党中央在庐山会议上，罢了彭德怀的官，撤了他的职。彭德怀和他的死党及其后台中国赫鲁晓夫，是不甘心于他们的失败的，他们时时企图进行翻案。一九六二年，中国赫鲁晓夫大刮翻案风，叫嚷什么彭德怀的反党纲领“不少是符合事实的”，“并不算犯错误”。于是他们抛出了反动影片《怒潮》，借渔鼓老人的口，把彭德怀这条历史上一贯反对毛主席的大爬虫，打扮成“一条龙”招摇过市。影片的炮制者还通过渔鼓老人大唱什么：“送君送到大路旁，君的恩情永不忘。农友乡亲心里亮，隔山隔水永相望”，来为罢了官的彭德怀招魂；叫嚷什么“风里浪里你行船，我执梭标望君还”，急切地盼望彭德怀“重振朝纲”，实行资本主义复辟。
    “金猴奋起千钧棒，玉宇澄清万里埃。”反动影片《怒潮》和大爬虫彭德怀早已为亿万工农兵揪出来示众了。现在我们必须继续把中国赫鲁晓夫及其大爬虫、小爬虫们统统扫进历史的垃圾堆，把他们批成为臭狗屎！让毛泽东思想永远普照着五洲四海！
