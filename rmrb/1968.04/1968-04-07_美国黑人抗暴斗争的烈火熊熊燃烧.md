Recently, in more than forty cities including Washington, New York, Chicago, and Boston, large-scale struggles against violence by Black Americans have erupted, further pushing the U.S. imperialists, who have suffered repeated defeats in the Vietnam War and are mired in a severe financial crisis, into deeper turmoil and disarray.

In Washington, fires are burning everywhere. Awakened Black Americans are setting fire to the stores of white racists, striking fear into the heart of the U.S. imperialist leader Johnson.

In Washington, enraged Black American crowds, undeterred by police suppression, bravely took to the streets, smashing the windows of many white-owned stores that have long discriminated against and exploited Black people.
