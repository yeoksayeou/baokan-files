Chairman Mao teaches us: "All revolutionary struggles in the world are aimed at seizing power and consolidating power." At present, the class enemies' important goal in sabotaging the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is to undermine the newly established revolutionary committees. They resort to every possible means to attempt to shake and destroy the new revolutionary power. Under these circumstances, the publication of Chairman Mao's latest instructions and the important editorials of central newspapers and journals have special and great significance. This is a heavy blow to a handful of class enemies; it will have an immeasurable impact on consolidating the newly established revolutionary committees.

The entire province's military and civilian population must immediately launch a mass movement to study, publicize, and implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions on the "three-in-one" revolutionary committees. In the process of study, we must carry forward the revolutionary learning style of combining theory with practice, which Chairman Mao personally advocates, making Chairman Mao's latest instructions known to every household and every individual, ensuring that every sentence and every word is implemented.

In places and units where revolutionary committees have not yet been established, it is equally important to seriously study Chairman Mao's latest instructions, to seize the opportunity, eliminate interference, advance with high spirits, and quickly achieve the revolutionary "three-in-one."

The entire province's military and civilian population must seriously study Chairman Mao's latest instructions, raise their understanding of revolutionary committees to a higher level, enthusiastically cherish them, resolutely support them, sincerely help them, and bravely defend them, so that they can be continuously improved and consolidated in the struggle; so that they can establish proletarian authority and play a great revolutionary role in the great struggle to achieve a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

专栏：各地报纸社论摘要

    大学习　大宣传　大落实
    毛主席教导我们：“世界上一切革命斗争都是为着夺取政权，巩固政权。”当前，阶级敌人破坏无产阶级文化大革命的一个重要目标，就是新生的革命委员会。他们千方百计地妄图动摇和破坏新生的革命政权。在这种情况下，毛主席最新指示的发表，中央报刊重要社论的发表，更具有特别重大的意义。这对一小撮阶级敌人，是一个沉重的打击；对巩固新生的革命委员会，将发生不可估量的作用。
    全省军民要立即掀起一个大学习、大宣传、大落实毛主席关于“三结合”的革命委员会的最新指示的群众运动。在学习中，要发扬毛主席亲自提倡的理论联系实际的革命好学风，使毛主席的最新指示家喻户晓，人人皆知，句句落实，字字落实。
    暂时没有建立革命委员会的地方和单位，同样要认真学习毛主席的最新指示，大借东风，排除干扰，高歌猛进，迅速实现革命的三结合。
    全省军民都要认真学习毛主席的最新指示，把对革命委员会的认识提得高高的，热情地爱护它，坚决地支持它，诚恳地帮助它，勇敢地捍卫它，使它在斗争中不断得到完善和巩固；使它在夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的伟大斗争中，树立起无产阶级权威，发挥巨大的革命作用。　江苏《新华日报》
