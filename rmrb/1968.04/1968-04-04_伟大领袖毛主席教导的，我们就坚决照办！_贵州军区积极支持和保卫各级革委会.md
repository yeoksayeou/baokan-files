We Resolutely Carry Out the Instructions of Chairman Mao!

The Guizhou Military Region Actively Supports and Defends the Revolutionary Committees at All Levels

The broad masses of soldiers and officers are propagating Mao Zedong Thought, assisting the revolutionary committees at all levels in implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions, and are striving to uphold the revolutionary authority of the revolutionary committees at all levels, and enthusiastically helping the revolutionary committees to build revolutionary leadership teams.

The Guizhou Military Region's troops, with a fervent devotion to the proletarian revolutionary line of the great leader Chairman Mao, resolutely support, endorse, and defend the Guizhou Provincial Revolutionary Committee, and actively promote the establishment and consolidation of revolutionary committees at all levels throughout the province, uphold their revolutionary authority, and help in their perfection and development. Over the past year, the Guizhou Military Region's troops have made new achievements in strengthening the dictatorship of the proletariat.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "In places and units where power needs to be seized, the policy of revolutionary 'three-in-one combination' must be implemented to establish a temporary power organ that is revolutionary, representative, and has proletarian authority. The name of this power organ is good to be called the Revolutionary Committee." The Guizhou Military Region's troops have repeatedly studied this teaching of Chairman Mao, recognizing that only by vigorously promoting the establishment and consolidation of revolutionary committees at all levels can the dictatorship of the proletariat be strengthened, and only then can Chairman Mao's series of latest instructions be fully implemented, and the comprehensive victory of the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat be achieved. When the Guizhou Provincial Revolutionary Committee was established, many leaders of the Military Region participated in the work of the Provincial Revolutionary Committee. The Military Region Party Committee also dispatched a large number of cadres to form "three-in-one combination" work teams under the unified leadership of the Provincial Revolutionary Committee, and went to various prefectures (prefectures and cities), counties (cities), to guide the military sub-districts and county (city) people's armed forces departments, supporting the local proletarian revolutionary factions to establish and consolidate revolutionary committees at all levels. At the same time, in the entire region's troops, a large number of cadres and soldiers were dispatched to directly engage in the "three supports, two militaries" work, helping the proletarian revolutionary factions to develop and consolidate the revolutionary great alliance and the revolutionary "three-in-one combination." Now, more than 90% of the counties and more than 80% of the districts in the entire province have established revolutionary committees.

Firmly Support, Endorse, and Defend the Revolutionary Committees at All Levels

The revolutionary committees are temporary power organs established under the guidance of the great leader Chairman Mao, in accordance with Mao Zedong Thought. Whether to support or oppose the revolutionary committees is an issue of attitude towards Chairman Mao, Mao Zedong Thought, and Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. The broad masses of soldiers and officers in the Guizhou Military Region believe that whatever Chairman Mao advocates, we must resolutely support; whatever Chairman Mao supports, we must resolutely support. They have taken a warmly supportive, resolutely endorsing, and actively defending attitude towards the revolutionary committees at all levels.

The Military Region Party Committee has made clear regulations that from the Military Region, military sub-districts, to county (city), district, and commune people's armed forces departments, all must accept the leadership of the revolutionary committees at the same level. With the gradual establishment of revolutionary committees at all levels, the Military Region's troops have further strengthened their support and defense of the revolutionary committees at all levels.

After the establishment of the revolutionary committees, there are countless tasks, the most important of which is to grasp the power to popularize Mao Zedong Thought and the power to implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions. The Guizhou Military Region's troops regard the vigorous propagation of Mao Zedong Thought and the assistance to the revolutionary committees at all levels in implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions as the greatest support for the revolutionary committees. For example, after the great leader Chairman Mao personally affirmed the experience of the Guiyang Cotton Mill in achieving revolutionary great unity according to administrative departments, the Guizhou Provincial Revolutionary Committee immediately issued the "Decision on Promoting and Learning from the Experience of Revolutionary Great Unity of the Proletarian Revolutionary Factions of the Guiyang Cotton Mill." The leadership of the Guizhou Military Region immediately called on all soldiers and officers participating in the "three supports, two militaries" work to resolutely carry out Chairman Mao's instructions and help the proletarian revolutionary factions implement the decision of the Provincial Revolutionary Committee. A wave of achieving revolutionary great unity quickly swept across the entire province.

The Guizhou Military Region's troops assist the revolutionary committees at all levels in holding extensive Mao Zedong Thought study classes. Mao Zedong Thought study classes have sprung up like bamboo shoots after a spring rain, covering vast urban and rural areas, with over five million people participating in the study classes. The troops also organized more than a thousand Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams, which went deep into factories, rural areas, schools, and institutions to propagate Chairman Mao's latest instructions and assist in their implementation. Mao Zedong Thought has never been as deeply rooted in people's hearts as it is today. All fronts in the province are vibrant and full of revolutionary vigor.

After the proletarian revolutionary factions took power, the focus of the struggle remained on the issue of power. Since the establishment of the Guizhou Provincial Revolutionary Committee, it has received the enthusiastic support and great trust of the revolutionary people throughout the province, and in leading the broad revolutionary masses to achieve decisive victories in the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat, it has gradually established revolutionary authority. However, the class enemies are unwilling to accept their doom and are trying every means to slander and attack the revolutionary committees, attempting to undermine the prestige of the revolutionary committees. The Guizhou Military Region's troops regard the defense of the revolutionary authority of the revolutionary committees as a glorious duty to defend Chairman Mao's revolutionary line and safeguard the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat. They have joined forces with the broad proletarian revolutionary factions to unremittingly fight against actions that harm the revolutionary authority of the revolutionary committees. When the Guizhou Provincial Revolutionary Committee was just established, and most prefectures (prefectures and cities) and counties (cities) had not yet achieved victory in the struggle for power, the Military Region and the Provincial Revolutionary Committee jointly issued relevant notices and orders, requiring the troops' leadership organs and armed forces departments at all levels to take the lead in executing them. On February 20 of last year, to smash the counter-revolutionary conspiracy of a handful of capitalist-roaders within the party, the Provincial Revolutionary Committee and the Military Region jointly issued an "Emergency Order." All soldiers and officers and the entire province's militia immediately took action, successfully repelling the frenzied counterattack of the class enemies and defending the revolutionary power. The Guizhou Military Region's troops also educate the masses with anarchist thoughts and bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism, draw clear lines between proletarian great democracy and bourgeois liberalization, between proletarian revolutionary discipline and bourgeois slave mentality, and between the dictatorship of the proletariat and the dictatorship of the bourgeoisie, guiding them to cherish, support, and defend the newly born revolutionary committees.

Actively Promote the Perfection and Development of the Revolutionary Committees

The revolutionary committees are new things and must go through a process of growth and perfection. The Guizhou Military Region's troops are full of enthusiasm and actively promote the perfection and development of the revolutionary committees at all levels.

The Guizhou Military Region Party Committee clearly proposed that to promote the perfection and development of the revolutionary committees, the first step is to help the revolutionary committees at all levels establish a revolutionary leadership team. The revolutionary committees at all levels must hoist high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, achieve the revolutionization of the leadership team, and fully implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions to achieve comprehensive victory in the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat. The vast majority of troops participating in the revolutionary "three-in-one combination" have done a good job in taking the lead in studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, taking the lead in breaking private interests and establishing public interests, and actively helping the revolutionary committees to establish the "daily reading" and "unshakable" learning system, placing the learning, execution, propaganda, and defense of Chairman Mao's latest instructions at the forefront of all work. They promote the revolutionary committees to hold extensive Mao Zedong Thought study classes, promote the thought revolutionization of the leadership team. They resolutely carry out Chairman Mao's instructions on "you must put politics in command, go among the masses, be with the masses, and make the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat better." They take the lead in going deep into the grassroots, maintaining close ties with the masses, consulting with the masses on matters, humbly learning from the masses, and being the masses' little students, forever maintaining the style of an ordinary soldier. At the same time, they pay attention to giving full play to the active role of revolutionary old cadres, forming a lively and vigorous situation where the old lead the new and the new help the old, jointly grasping and using power well.

    伟大领袖毛主席教导的，我们就坚决照办！
    贵州军区积极支持和保卫各级革委会
    广大指战员把宣传毛泽东思想，协助各级革委会落实毛主席最新指示，作为对革委会的最大支持，并努力维护各级革委会的革命权威，热情帮助革委会建成革命化的领导班子
    本报讯　贵州省军区部队广大指战员，怀着对伟大领袖毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的赤胆忠心，坚决支持、拥护、保卫贵州省革命委员会，并大力促进全省各级革命委员会的建立和巩固，维护它的革命权威，帮助它的完善和发展。一年多来，贵州省军区部队为加强无产阶级专政立了新功。
    毛主席教导我们：“在需要夺权的那些地方和单位，必须实行革命的‘三结合’的方针，建立一个革命的、有代表性的、有无产阶级权威的临时权力机构。这个权力机构的名称，叫革命委员会好。”贵州省军区部队反复学习毛主席这一教导，认识到只有大力促进各级革命委员会的建立和巩固，才能加强无产阶级专政，才能条条落实、全面落实毛主席的一系列最新指示，夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利。贵州省革命委员会成立的时候，省军区的许多负责同志参加了省革命委员会的工作。省军区党委还抽出大批干部，在省革命委员会的统一领导下，组成三结合的工作队，分赴各专区（州）、县（市），指导各军分区和县（市）人民武装部，支持当地无产阶级革命派建立和巩固各级革命委员会。同时，在全区部队中，抽调大批干部、战士，直接投入“三支”“两军”工作，帮助无产阶级革命派发展和巩固革命的大联合和革命的三结合。现在，全省百分之九十左右的县，百分之八十的区，已经建立了革命委员会。
  坚决支持、拥护、保卫各级革命委员会
    革命委员会，是在伟大领袖毛主席的指引下，按照毛泽东思想建立的临时权力机构。对于革命委员会是拥护还是反对，这是对毛主席、对毛泽东思想、对毛主席的革命路线的态度问题。贵州省军区部队广大指战员认为，凡是毛主席提倡的，我们就坚决拥护；凡是毛主席支持的，我们就坚决支持。他们对各级革命委员会采取了热情支持、坚决拥护、积极保卫的态度。
    省军区党委做出明确规定，从省军区、军分区直到县（市）、区、社人民武装部，一律接受同级革命委员会的领导。随着各级革命委员会的陆续建立，军区部队进一步加强了支持和保卫各级革命委员会的工作。
    革命委员会成立以后，工作千头万绪，最主要的是要掌好普及毛泽东思想的权，掌好落实毛主席最新指示的权。贵州省军区部队把大力宣传毛泽东思想，协助各级革命委员会落实毛主席最新指示，作为对革命委员会的最大支持。例如，当伟大领袖毛主席亲自肯定了贵阳棉纺厂按行政部门实行革命大联合的经验以后，贵州省革命委员会立即做出《关于推广、学习贵阳棉纺厂无产阶级革命派大联合的经验的决定》。贵州省军区领导机关立即号召参加“三支”“两军”工作的全体指战员，坚决执行毛主席的指示，帮助无产阶级革命派贯彻省革命委员会的决定。全省迅速掀起了一个实现革命大联合的热潮。
    贵州省军区部队协助各级革命委员会大办毛泽东思想学习班。全省毛泽东思想学习班如雨后春笋，遍及广大城乡，参加学习班的人数已达五百余万。各部队还组织了上千个毛泽东思想宣传队，深入工厂、农村、学校、机关，宣传毛主席的最新指示，协助落实毛主席的最新指示。毛泽东思想从来没有象今天这样深入人心。全省各条战线都是一派欣欣向荣、朝气蓬勃的革命景象。
    无产阶级革命派掌权以后，斗争的焦点仍然是政权问题。贵州省革命委员会建立以来，得到全省革命人民的热烈拥护和极大信任，并在带领广大革命群众夺取无产阶级文化大革命决定性胜利的斗争中，逐步建立起了革命的权威。可是，阶级敌人不甘心他们的灭亡，千方百计地对革命委员会进行诋毁和攻击，妄图破坏革命委员会的威信。贵州省军区部队把维护革命委员会的革命权威，作为捍卫毛主席的革命路线，保卫无产阶级文化大革命的光荣职责。他们和广大无产阶级革命派紧密团结在一起，同损害革命委员会的革命权威的行径，进行了不懈的斗争。当贵州省革命委员会刚刚建立，大部分专区（州）、县（市）还未取得夺权斗争胜利的时候，省军区和省革命委员会共同签署有关通知、通令，要求部队各级领导机关和人民武装部门坚决带头执行。去年二月二十日，为了粉碎党内一小撮走资派的反革命阴谋，省革命委员会和省军区共同签署联合发出“紧急通令”。全体指战员、全省民兵，立即行动起来，胜利地打退了阶级敌人的疯狂反扑，保卫了革命政权。贵州省军区部队还教育有无政府主义思想和资产阶级、小资产阶级派性的群众，划清无产阶级大民主和资产阶级自由化的界限，划清无产阶级的革命纪律和资产阶级奴隶主义的界限，无产阶级专政和资产阶级专政的界限，引导他们爱护、支持和保卫新生的革命委员会。
    积极促进革命委员会的完善和发展
    革命委员会是新生的事物，必然有一个成长、完善的过程。贵州省军区部队满腔热情，积极促进各级革命委员会的完善和发展。
    贵州省军区党委明确提出，要促进革命委员会的完善和发展，首先要帮助各级革命委员会建立一个革命化的领导班子。各级革命委员会高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，实现领导班子革命化，才能全面落实毛主席的最新指示，夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利。参加革命三结合的绝大部分部队干部，做到了带头活学活用毛主席著作，带头破私立公，并积极帮助革命委员会建立“天天读”、“雷打不动”的学习制度，把学习、执行、宣传和捍卫毛主席最新指示，摆在一切工作的首位。他们推动革命委员会大办毛泽东思想学习班，促进领导班子的思想革命化。他们坚决执行毛主席关于“你们要政治挂帅，到群众里面去，和群众在一起，把无产阶级文化大革命搞得更好”的指示，带头深入基层，密切联系群众，遇事和群众商量，虚心向群众学习，当群众的小学生，永远保持普通一兵的本色。同时，注意发挥革命老干部的积极作用，形成老带新，新帮老，共同掌好权、用好权的生动活泼的局面。
