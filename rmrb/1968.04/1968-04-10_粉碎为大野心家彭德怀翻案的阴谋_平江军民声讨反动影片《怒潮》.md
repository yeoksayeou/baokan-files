Edition: 4

The reactionary film "Angry Tide" is a declaration for the rehabilitation of Peng Dehuai, a song to vindicate Peng Dehuai. This film distorts history, glorifies the disgraced ambitious plotter Peng Dehuai, and viciously attacks our great leader Chairman Mao, preparing public opinion for the restoration of capitalism.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "All erroneous thoughts, all poisonous weeds, all monsters and demons should be criticized. We must not allow them to spread freely." Recently, the People's Liberation Army, which is carrying out the task of supporting the left in Pingjiang, and the old Red Guards, old Red Army soldiers, revolutionary masses, and Red Guards who participated in the revolutionary struggle in Pingjiang, held a symposium to denounce this reactionary film "Angry Tide" that seeks to rehabilitate Peng Dehuai.

Pingjiang's Revolutionary History Cannot Be Distorted

Yu Ruoxian (son of a revolutionary martyr, revolutionary cadre):
Pingjiang's revolutionary movement was initiated by our great leader Chairman Mao. As early as autumn 1921, Chairman Mao personally recruited party members in Pingjiang and established the first party cell in the region. Later, many cadres from Pingjiang went to study at the "Peasant Movement Training Institute" in Guangzhou, which Chairman Mao established, and directly received the nurturing of great Mao Zedong Thought. Under Chairman Mao's personal care, various revolutionary mass organizations such as the peasants' association and workers' guilds in Pingjiang sprang up like bamboo shoots after a spring rain. At that time, under the party's leadership, the workers and peasants of Pingjiang took up arms, established the peasants' self-defense corps and workers' self-defense corps, and launched a vigorous campaign of rent reduction, land redistribution, and the boycott and burning of foreign goods, creating a great situation "like a sudden storm, swift and fierce." In September 1927, Chairman Mao personally initiated and led the famous "Autumn Harvest Uprising." Part of the workers' and peasants' self-defense corps in Pingjiang responded to the great call of the "Autumn Harvest Uprising" and followed Chairman Mao to Jinggangshan.

History tells us that the revolutionary flames in Pingjiang were lit by our great leader Chairman Mao. However, the creators of the reactionary film "Angry Tide" distorted historical facts, portraying Peng Dehuai as the "savior" of the people of Pingjiang, attributing the great achievements of the peasant movement in Pingjiang to Peng Dehuai's black account. We, the revolutionary people of Pingjiang, and the descendants of revolutionary martyrs, will never agree to this!

Li Hansheng (old Red Guard, old poor peasant):
The poisonous weed "Angry Tide" distorts right and wrong, distorts history, and praises Peng Dehuai to the skies. Watching this film, I am extremely angry.

What is Peng Dehuai? We old poor peasants in Pingjiang know best: at that time, he was a regimental commander in the Kuomintang, a butcher who suppressed the peasant movement in Pingjiang. In 1927, after Chairman Mao led the troops to Jinggangshan, the Pingjiang-Bianyang region, under the leadership of comrades such as Xia Minghan, established the Pingjiang-Xiangyin-Yueyang guerrilla squad. I was a member of this squad. At that time, the Kuomintang reactionaries carried out white terror, shouting "better to kill three thousand innocently than to let one guilty person go." But we remembered Chairman Mao's teachings, relied on the masses, mobilized the masses, and carried out guerrilla warfare. After more than a year of struggle, our guerrilla forces were greatly strengthened. In May 1928, the Kuomintang reactionaries sent the "model" independent fifth division of the Hunan army, first regiment, acting commander Peng Dehuai, to "suppress the communists" in Pingjiang. As soon as Peng Dehuai arrived in Pingjiang, he led the local Kuomintang armed forces—the "household troops"—to attack the guerrilla areas in the southeast of Pingjiang. These bloodthirsty beasts killed people, burned houses, and looted property, killing many guerrilla fighters and poor peasants. Soon, Peng Dehuai led his troops and the "household troops" and local tyrants to attack the areas around Changshan, Ludong, and Anding Bridge. In Ludong alone, they killed five of our guerrilla fighters and poor peasants, burned dozens of houses, and looted countless items.

We poor peasants hate Peng Dehuai to the core. But the creators of the film "Angry Tide" went to great lengths to spread rumors, openly praising Peng Dehuai as the "sun," the "dragon," and the "leader" of the peasant movement in Pingjiang, which is extremely arrogant. Peng Dehuai, this great ambitionist and warlord, has been exposed by the party central committee led by Chairman Mao. Now we must carry forward the revolutionary spirit of beating a fallen enemy to the ground and resolutely criticize Peng Dehuai to the end!

Tang Biao (old underground courier, retired cadre):
Peng Dehuai once said that the Guangzhou Uprising failed, the Nanchang Uprising also failed, and the Autumn Harvest Uprising was about attacking cities and failing, then retreating to a place. "Before 1928, the revolution was in a low ebb, and the signal for the revolutionary tide was the Pingjiang Uprising." Peng Dehuai, in order to elevate himself, shamelessly and madly belittled the great historical significance of the "Autumn Harvest Uprising" led by our great leader Chairman Mao. His wolfish ambitions are so evil!

Facts speak louder than words. Before the "Pingjiang Uprising," Pingjiang had already preliminarily met the two conditions for establishing a revolutionary base proposed by Chairman Mao, that is, establishing revolutionary armed forces and mobilizing the masses. The revolutionary struggle of the revolutionary base of Jinggangshan, personally created by Chairman Mao, directly promoted the rapid development of the peasant revolutionary movement in Pingjiang. In March 1928, Pingjiang City was already surrounded by our guerrilla forces. Moreover, at that time, the independent fifth division of the Hunan army had a secret party branch of ours. Many regiments had established secret revolutionary organizations—the soldiers' committees—and had used the situation that the troops had not been paid for more than a year to mobilize the soldiers to demand pay twice. At that time, Peng Dehuai could no longer control this regiment. Comrade Huang Guelue, a Communist Party member serving as the commander of the third regiment of the independent third division of the Hunan army, was the first to launch an uprising in Jiayi Town, Pingjiang, on July 21. On July 22, Communist Party members working in the first regiment also actively responded in Pingjiang City. Under the threat of the surging peasant movement in Pingjiang, and angry at not being appointed as the division commander during the reorganization of the Hunan army, Peng Dehuai then joined the revolutionary ranks with the idea of "investing."

History clearly tells us: the "Pingjiang Uprising" occurred under the direct leadership of Chairman Mao's "Autumn Harvest Uprising" and the direct influence and promotion of the Jinggangshan base. It was carried out under the direct leadership of the party and with the strong support of the revolutionary masses in Pingjiang. However, the creators of the reactionary film "Angry Tide" crowned Peng Dehuai as the "revolutionary leader" of the "Pingjiang Uprising," viciously distorting the history of the "Pingjiang Uprising," which is intolerable!

Do Not Sing Praises to the Opportunist Line

Wu Zhengnan (retired old Red Army soldier):
The reactionary film "Angry Tide" prominently depicts the "February Attack on the City" in Pingjiang. But what was the real situation at that time?

I joined the revolution in Pingjiang in 1927. At that time, the Kuomintang betrayed the revolution and carried out a bloody massacre of the workers and peasants, and the revolution was in a low ebb. At this critical moment in the revolution, our great leader Chairman Mao personally led the peasants in Pingjiang and Bianyang to revolt and launched the famous "Autumn Harvest Uprising." Later, Chairman Mao led this force to march to Jinggangshan, thus opening the revolutionary road of the vanguard of the proletariat going deep into the countryside, leading the peasants to carry out armed struggles, establishing rural bases, surrounding the cities with the countryside, and seizing national victory. But the attack on Pingjiang went against Chairman Mao's correct line, executing the "leftist adventurist" line. The time of the attack on Pingjiang was not before the "Autumn Harvest Uprising" as the film said, but on February 22, 1928 (lunar calendar); the result of the attack was not the "victory" that the film boasted about, but failure. On the day of the attack, the peasants from Nanzhou crossed the floating bridge east of the city to attack the east gate of Pingjiang, and the peasants from Dongzhou and Beizhou crossed the wooden bridge north of the city to attack the north gate of Pingjiang. Because the enemy was well-prepared, we were beaten back before we could enter the city. After the attack failed, we were also subjected to a bloody massacre by the warlords. This is a bitter historical lesson caused by the "leftist adventurist" line. The reactionary film "Angry Tide" viciously praises Peng Dehuai's "leftist adventurist" attack on the city and places it after Chairman Mao's "letter," attributing the error to Chairman Mao, which is despicable!

Yang Xiongshan (revolutionary worker), He Xiuying (military family member, active learner of Chairman Mao's works in Guangzhou troops):
We revolutionary masses in Pingjiang all know that Peng Dehuai is an old opportunist. But the creators of the film "Angry Tide" describe Peng Dehuai's opportunist line as a revolutionary line, beautifying the butcher Peng Dehuai, who is stained with the blood of revolutionary people, into a "consistently correct," "brave and courageous leader," and arranging a scene of attacking a city and achieving "victory" to push the whole play to a climax and end. This is a blatant incitement of opportunists to attack Chairman Mao's revolutionary line! Their intentions are extremely sinister!

Yuan Panliang (platoon leader of a certain unit of the PLA), Li Zhenxiao (active learner of Chairman Mao's works in Guangzhou troops, five-good soldier):
In our work of "three supports and two militaries" in Pingjiang, we have contacted many revolutionary elders, families of revolutionary martyrs, and poor peasants, and learned about many shocking class struggle facts, further exposing the ugly face of Peng Dehuai, this great schemer, great ambitionist, and great warlord. Since Peng Dehuai joined the revolutionary ranks, he has consistently opposed Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line and faithfully executed the opportunist lines of Li Lisan and Wang Ming. During the War of Resistance Against Japan, he stubbornly pushed the line of capitulationism. After the founding of the country, he still insisted on the reactionary stance of the bourgeoisie, madly opposed the study of Chairman Mao's works, opposed the prominence of proletarian politics, and opposed Chairman Mao's proletarian military line, actively promoting the bourgeois military line. The creators of the reactionary film "Angry Tide" want people to regard such an unrepentant, thoroughly reactionary old opportunist as the creator of the Chinese revolution to imitate. They play tricks by waving the "red flag" to oppose the red flag, using the pretext of opposing right opportunism to vigorously promote "leftist adventurism," singing praises to the bitter historical lessons as victorious experiences, and promoting Peng Dehuai's "leftist adventurism" as Chairman Mao's correct line. Their purpose is to oppose Chairman Mao, oppose Mao Zedong Thought, and oppose Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. We, the People's Liberation Army, are the most loyal defenders of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. We must thoroughly criticize the reactionary film "Angry Tide," thoroughly eliminate the poison of the Chinese Khrushchev and the clique of Peng Dehuai, Luo Ronghuan, and other capitalist-roaders within the party, and forever march forward along Chairman Mao's proletarian military line!

Defeat the Counter-Revolutionary Restoration and Rehabilitation Trend

Yan Jiyun (active learner of Chairman Mao's works in Guangzhou troops, five-good soldier):
In 1959, the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee exposed and smashed the anti-party clique led by Peng Dehuai. This is a great victory of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line! But the struggle between the two lines within our party has not ended. Our struggle against the reactionary film "Angry Tide" is a continuation of this class struggle. "Angry Tide" and "The Dismissal of Hai Rui" are of the same ilk, and the key issue is "dismissal." The creators of these two reactionary plays and films, under the strong support and incitement of the Chinese Khrushchev, directed their arrows at the party's Lushan Conference, vindicating the right opportunists represented by Peng Dehuai, attempting to bring Peng Dehuai, who had been dismissed, back to power, and realizing their counter-revolutionary restoration plot.

In the earlier drafts of "Angry Tide," there was no scene of Luo Dacheng being "dismissed." After Peng Dehuai was dismissed at the party's Lushan Conference in 1959, the creators of the film added the "dismissal" scene and "farewell" scene, and made it the focus of the film. The film also uses the "splitting method," sometimes attaching Peng Dehuai's ghost to the "consistently correct" Luo Dacheng, sometimes attaching it to the "brave and good fighter" Qu Jin, and sometimes transferring it to the "patriotic and people-loving" Kuomintang officer Huang Weiguo, all to beautify Peng Dehuai and prepare public opinion for his rehabilitation. The creators of the film felt that the "anger" in "Angry Tide" was not enough and shouted at the end of the farewell song in the film, "You sail in the wind and waves, I hold the spear and wait for you to return." Is this not the same as Hai Rui in "The Dismissal of Hai Rui," who says, "If there is a day when I return to office, I will rectify the administration"? The Chinese Khrushchev, Peng Dehuai, and their remaining diehards want to reverse the correct and wise decisions of the party's Lushan Conference, which is impossible!

Zhong Tiejing (actor):
I am an actor of the Pingjiang Flower Drum Opera Troupe. I and my colleagues participated in the filming of "Angry Tide" and witnessed many facts, proving that this film is for the rehabilitation of Peng Dehuai.

The creators of "Angry Tide" forcibly combined the "February Attack on the City" in Pingjiang and the "Pingjiang Uprising" and falsely claimed it as the "Autumn Harvest Uprising," greatly praising Peng Dehuai. At that time, some comrades pointed out that Peng Dehuai had been dismissed at the Lushan Conference, and if a film about this aspect was to be shot, it must be reported to Chairman Mao and the party central committee for approval. However, the creators of the film used their stolen authority to adopt high-pressure methods and also use sweet talk to deceive and propagandize, spreading such shameless lies as "filming 'Angry Tide' is the glory of the people of Pingjiang," "filming this film has world significance, telling the world people which road to take. This is the first film about peasant uprisings," etc. During the filming of "Angry Tide," the creators of the film led the actors to visit the memorial sites of the "Pingjiang Uprising," introducing in detail Peng Dehuai's "place of uprising," "place of appointing generals," "tree for tying horses," and "house for camping." For every mountain, water, grass, and tree scene in the film, they arranged according to the environment Peng Dehuai was in during the "Pingjiang Uprising." Isn't this blatantly erecting a monument for Peng Dehuai, who had been dismissed?

Ren Jinsheng, Lu Chuangjia (Red Guards):
The reactionary film "Angry Tide" falsely writes about the Autumn Harvest Uprising, truly praises Peng Dehuai; falsely writes about the revolutionary struggle history of Pingjiang, truly rehabilitates Peng Dehuai. And Peng Dehuai, this hypocrite, in order to put gold on his own face, even more falsely claims truth, fabricates out of thin air, to the extreme. On December 21, 1958, Peng Dehuai, under the banner of "visiting" Pingjiang, came to our Pingjiang No. 1 Middle School. Pingjiang No. 1 Middle School is the command post where the butcher Peng Dehuai once "suppressed the communists" and the old site of his "uprising." Peng Dehuai stood on our school's playground and said, "This is the place where I launched an uprising 30 years ago," and pointing to a phoenix tree, he said, "This is the tree where I once tied my horse." He took photos everywhere, wrote inscriptions, and even donated some guns and ammunition to Pingjiang No. 1 Middle School in his personal name. To praise Peng Dehuai, a small clique of capitalist-roaders within the party and monsters and demons wrote "Pingjiang Revolutionary Struggle History" and "Angry Tide" Flower Drum Opera, and even set up a "Pingjiang Uprising Room" in our Pingjiang No. 1 Middle School, built a so-called "Peng Dehuai Road." Every year, students admitted to Pingjiang No. 1 Middle School are collectively taken to visit the "Pingjiang Uprising Room," attempting to lead our younger generation down the dead end of revisionism, how evil!

Our great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "All reactionary things, if you do not beat them, they will not fall. This is also like sweeping the floor, if the broom does not reach, the dust will not run away by itself." After the party's Lushan Conference, we revolutionary teachers and students have seen through Peng Dehuai's reactionary face, and we hate Peng Dehuai and his diehards to the core. We resolutely defend the wise decisions of the Lushan Conference, wielding the thousand-jin hammer of Mao Zedong Thought, smashed the "Pingjiang Uprising Room," and destroyed Peng Dehuai's inscriptions. To better defend the wise decisions of the party's Lushan Conference, we have launched a mass movement to thoroughly eliminate the poison of the Chinese Khrushchev, Peng Dehuai, and their diehards, and we will continue it.

"One should pursue the fleeing enemy with remaining strength, and should not seek fame like the King of Chu." The comrades participating in the symposium unanimously expressed their determination to hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, closely follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, carry forward the thorough revolutionary spirit of beating a fallen enemy to the ground, overthrow the Chinese Khrushchev, overthrow Peng Dehuai! Criticize the black "Angry Tide" to the end! Seize the comprehensive victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution!

    粉碎为大野心家彭德怀翻案的阴谋
    ——平江军民声讨反动影片《怒潮》
    反动影片《怒潮》是一部为彭德怀翻案的宣言书，是一支为彭德怀鸣“冤”叫“屈”的招魂曲。这部影片篡改历史，大肆美化被罢了官的大野心家、大阴谋家彭德怀，恶毒地攻击我们伟大的领袖毛主席，来为资本主义复辟作舆论准备。
    毛主席教导我们说：“凡是错误的思想，凡是毒草，凡是牛鬼蛇神，都应该进行批判，决不能让它们自由泛滥。”最近，在平江地区执行支左任务的人民解放军和当年参加平江地区革命斗争的老赤卫队员、老红军以及革命群众、红卫兵小将，举行座谈会，愤怒声讨这部为彭德怀翻案的反动影片《怒潮》。
  平江革命斗争历史不容篡改
    余若仙（革命烈士子弟、革命干部）：
    平江地区的革命运动是我们伟大领袖毛主席亲自发动起来的。早在一九二一年秋，毛主席曾经亲自发展平江的党员，建立了平江地区第一个党小组。后来，平江地区的许多干部又到毛主席在广州举办的“农民运动讲习所”学习，直接受到了伟大的毛泽东思想的哺育。在毛主席的亲切关怀下，平江地区的农民协会、职工同业社等各种革命群众组织，象雨后春笋般纷纷成立起来了。当时在党的领导下，平江工农群众拿起了枪杆子，建立了农民赤卫队、工农赤卫队，开展了轰轰烈烈的减租减押、打土豪、分田地运动和抵制、烧毁洋货运动，出现了“其势如暴风骤雨，迅猛异常”的伟大局面。一九二七年九月，毛主席亲自发动和领导了震惊世界的“秋收起义”。平江地区部分工农赤卫队响应
  “秋收起义”的伟大号召，跟随毛主席上了井冈山。
    历史的事实告诉我们，平江地区的革命烈火，是我们伟大领袖毛主席亲手点燃的。但是反动影片《怒潮》的炮制者，却篡改史实，把彭德怀打扮成平江人民的“救世主”，把平江地区农民运动的伟大功绩一古脑儿记在彭德怀的黑账上，我们平江革命人民，我们革命烈士的后代，一千个不答应，一万个不答应！
    李翰生（老赤卫队员、老贫农）：大毒草《怒潮》颠倒是非，歪曲历史，把彭德怀捧上了天，看了这部影片，我真气愤极了。
    彭德怀是个什么东西呢？我们平江老贫下中农最清楚：那时他是国民党的一个团长、镇压平江农民运动的刽子手。一九二七年，毛主席率领部队上了井冈山以后，平（江）浏（阳）地区在夏明翰等同志领导下，成立了平（江）湘（阴）岳（阳）游击支队，我在这个支队里当队员。当时国民党反动派实行白色恐怖，叫嚷什么“宁可枉杀三千，不可错放一人。”但是我们牢记毛主席的教导，充分依靠群众，发动群众，开展游击战争。经过一年多的斗争，我们游击队大大加强了。一九二八年五月，国民党反动派就派湘军“模范”独立第五师第一团代理团长彭德怀到平江地区“剿共”。彭德怀一到平江，就带着国民党的地方武装——挨户团，进攻平江东南一带的游击区。这些嗜血成性的野兽，见人就杀，见房子就烧，见东西就抢，杀害了很多游击队员和贫下中农。不久，彭德怀又带着他的部队和挨户团、土豪劣绅进攻蒋山、芦洞和安定桥一带。仅在芦洞就杀害了我游击队员、贫下中农五个人，烧毁房子几十间，抢掠的东西不计其数。
    我们贫下中农对彭德怀这个坏家伙无不咬牙切齿，痛恨万分。可是影片《怒潮》的炮制者极尽造谣之能事，却公然吹捧彭德怀是什么“太阳”，是“龙”，是平江地区农民运动的“领袖”，真是狂妄之极。彭德怀这个大野心家、大军阀早已被以毛主席为首的党中央揪出来了。现在我们必须发扬痛打落水狗的革命精神，坚决把彭德怀批倒批臭！
    汤　彪（老地下交通员、退休干部）：
    彭德怀曾经胡说什么“广州暴动失败了，南昌起义也失败了，秋收起义就是打城市打不开，然后退到一个地方。”“一九二八年以前处于革命低潮，革命来潮的信号就是平江起义”。彭德怀为了抬高自己，公然丧心病狂地贬低我们伟大领袖毛主席领导的“秋收起义”的伟大历史意义，其狼子野心何其毒也！
    事实胜于雄辩。“平江起义”前，平江地区已经初步具备了毛主席提出的建立革命根据地的两个条件，即建立了革命武装，发动了群众。毛主席亲手缔造的井冈山革命根据地的革命斗争，又直接推动了平江地区的农民革命运动迅速发展。一九二八年三月，平江城已处在我游击队的重重包围之中。另外，当时湘军独立第五师第一团已有了我党的秘密支部。许多连队都建立了秘密的革命组织——士兵委员会，并曾利用部队一年多没有发饷的情况，发动士兵两次闹饷。当时彭德怀实际上已经无法控制这个部队。在湘军独立第五师第三团三营任营长的共产党员黄公略同志于七月二十一日首先在平江嘉义镇举行了起义，七月二十二日，在一团工作的共产党员，也在平江城积极响应。彭德怀在汹涌澎湃的平江农民运动的威慑下，又愤于在湘军整编时没有当上师长，于是便带着“入股”思想，混到革命队伍里来。
    历史最清楚地告诉我们：“平江起义”是在毛主席亲自领导的“秋收起义”和井冈山根据地的直接影响和推动下发生的，是在党的直接领导和平江地区革命群众的大力配合下进行的。但是，反动影片《怒潮》的炮制者，把彭德怀封为“平江起义”的“革命领袖”，恶毒地篡改“平江起义”的历史，是不可容忍的！
  不准为机会主义路线唱赞歌
    吴正南（退休老红军）：
    反动影片《怒潮》突出地描写了平江“二月扑城”。但当时事实的真相究竟如何呢？
    我是一九二七年在平江参加革命的。那时，国民党叛变革命，对工农群众实行血腥大屠杀，革命处于低潮。在这个革命的紧要关头，我们伟大领袖毛主席亲自领导我们平江、浏阳一带农民暴动，举行了著名的“秋收起义”。以后，毛主席率领这支部队进军井冈山，从此开辟了无产阶级先锋队深入农村，领导农民进行武装斗争，建立农村根据地，以农村包围城市，夺取全国胜利的革命道路。但平江扑城却违背了毛主席这一正确路线，执行的是“左”倾盲动主义路线。平江扑城的时间不是影片所说的在一九二七年“秋收起义”之前，而是在一九二八年二月二十二日（农历）；扑城的结果也不是影片所吹嘘的“胜利”，而是失败的。扑城那天，南乡农民经过城东的浮桥向平江东门进攻，东乡、北乡农民经过城北木桥向平江北门进攻。由于敌人早有准备，我们没有攻到城里就被打了回来，攻城失败后又遭到了军阀的血腥屠杀。这是“左”倾盲动主义路线所造成的惨痛的历史教训。反动影片《怒潮》却恶毒地把吹捧彭德怀“左”倾盲动主义的扑城硬安放在毛主席“来信”之后，把错误强加在毛主席身上，真是卑鄙无耻！
    杨雄山（革命工人）、何秀英（军人家属、广州部队学习毛主席著作积极分子）：
    我们平江的革命群众都晓得彭德怀是个老牌的机会主义分子。可是，影片《怒潮》的炮制者，却把彭德怀的机会主义路线描写成为革命路线，把沾满了革命人民鲜血的刽子手彭德怀，美化成“一贯正确”、
  “作战勇敢的领袖”，千方百计地安排了一个攻打城市并且取得了“胜利”的场面，将全剧推到了高潮而结束。这是明目张胆地煽动机会主义分子向毛主席的革命路线的猖狂进攻！其用心真是险恶之极！
    袁盘良（解放军某部排长）、李振孝（广州部队学习毛主席著作积极分子、五好战士）：
    我们在平江地区执行“三支”“两军”工作中，接触了许多革命老人、革命烈士家属和贫下中农，了解了许多惊心动魄的阶级斗争史实，更加看清了彭德怀这个大阴谋家、大野心家、大军阀的狰狞面目。彭德怀从混入革命队伍之后，就一贯反对毛主席无产阶级革命路线，忠实执行李立三、王明的机会主义路线。在抗日战争中，他又顽固地推行投降主义路线。建国以后，他仍然坚持资产阶级反动立场，疯狂反对学习毛主席著作，反对突出无产阶级政治，反对毛主席的无产阶级军事路线，积极推行资产阶级军事路线。反动影片《怒潮》的炮制者，却要人们把这样一个屡教不改、反动透顶的老牌机会主义分子，当作中国革命的缔造者来效法。他们玩弄打着“红旗”反红旗的卑鄙伎俩，以反对右倾机会主义为名，大肆鼓吹“左”倾盲动主义，把惨痛的历史教训当作胜利的经验来歌颂，把彭德怀当时“左”倾盲动主义冒充为毛主席的正确路线来加以宣扬，其目的就是反对毛主席、反对毛泽东思想、反对毛主席的革命路线。我们人民解放军是毛主席革命路线最忠实的捍卫者，我们必须彻底批判反动影片
  《怒潮》，彻底肃清中国赫鲁晓夫和彭德怀、罗瑞卿等党内一小撮走资派的流毒，永远沿着毛主席无产阶级建军路线奋勇前进！
    击退反革命复辟的翻案风
      艮际云（广州部队学习毛主席著作积极分子、
  五好战士）：
      一九五九年，党的八届八中全会揭露和粉碎了以
  彭德怀为首的反党集团。这是毛主席无产阶级革命路
  线的伟大胜利！但是，我们党内两条路线的斗争并没
  有结束。我们对反动影片《怒潮》的斗争，正是这场
  阶级斗争的继续。《怒潮》和《海瑞罢官》是一路货
  色，“要害问题是‘罢官’。”这两部反动的戏和影片的炮
  制者，都是在中国赫鲁晓夫的大力支持和鼓动下，把
  矛头指向党的庐山会议，为以彭德怀为代表的右倾机
  会主义鸣“冤”叫“屈”，妄图使罢了官的彭德怀重新
  上台，以实现其反革命复辟的阴谋。
      在《怒潮》前几稿中，都没有罗大成被“罢官”的情节，一九五九年党的庐山会议罢了彭德怀的官以后，影片的炮制者就增加了“罢官”情节和“送别”场面，并且作为影片的重点。影片还采用“分身法”，把彭德怀的幽灵时而寄托在“一贯正确”的罗大成身上，时而依附在“勇敢善战”的“农民的儿子”邱金身上，时而又转放在“救国为民”的国民党军官黄维国身上，都是为了美化彭德怀，为彭德怀翻案作舆论准备的。影片的炮制者觉得《怒潮》的“怒”还不够，竟在影片中送君歌的末尾，杀气腾腾地喊道：“风里浪里你行船，我执梭标望君还。”这与《海瑞罢官》中的海瑞，“有一日再居官重整纪纲”，不是异曲同工吗？中国赫鲁晓夫、彭德怀及其死党余孽，妄图把党的庐山会议英明正确的决定颠倒过来，是永远办不到的！
    钟特英（演员）：
    我是平江花鼓戏剧团的演员，我和我们单位的同志曾参加过《怒潮》的拍摄，耳闻目睹许多事实，证明这部影片是为彭德怀翻案的。
      《怒潮》的炮制者硬把平江“二月扑城”和“平江起义”凑合在一起，冒充为“秋收起义”，大肆吹捧彭德怀。当时有的同志提出，彭德怀已在庐山会议上被罢官了，要拍摄这方面的影片，必须报毛主席和党中央批准。可是影片炮制者却利用窃取的职权，一方面采用高压手段，同时又花言巧语进行欺骗宣传，散布什么拍《怒潮》是平江人民的“光荣”，“拍摄这部影片具有世界意义，告诉世界人民走什么道路。这是农民暴动的第一部影片”等无耻谰言。在《怒潮》拍摄期间，影片炮制者带领演员们到处参观“平江起义”的纪念地址，详细介绍彭德怀“起义的地方”、
  “点将的地方”、“拴马的树”、“宿营的房子”。对于影片中的一山一水、一草一木的镜头，都要按照“平江起义”时彭德怀所处的环境来布置。这不是明目张胆地为被罢了官的彭德怀树碑立传，又是什么呢？
    任金成、鲁创家（红卫兵）：
    反动影片《怒潮》写秋收起义是假，为彭德怀歌功颂德是真；写平江革命斗争史是假，为彭德怀翻案是真。而彭德怀这个伪君子为了往自己脸上贴金，更是以假当真，无中生有，到了无以复加的地步。一九五八年十二月二十一日，彭德怀打着“访问”平江的旗号，到了我们平江第一中学。平江一中就是刽子手彭德怀当年“剿共”的指挥部和后来“起义”的旧址。彭德怀站在我们学校的操场上说：“这是我三十年前起义的地方”，指着一棵梧桐树又说：“这是我当年拴过马的树。”他到处摄影留念，题词“赠”言，并以他
  个人名义送了一些枪支弹药给平江一中。为了吹捧彭德怀，党内一小撮走资派和牛鬼蛇神，编写什么《平江革命斗争史》和《怒潮》花鼓戏，还在我们平江一
  中设立什么“平江起义室”，修了一条所谓“彭德怀
  路”。每年考进平江一中的学生，都要集体参观“平江
  起义室”，妄图把我们青年一代引向修正主义的死胡
  同，何其毒也！
      伟大领袖毛主席教导我们：“凡是反动的东西，你
  不打，他就不倒。这也和扫地一样，扫帚不到，灰尘
  照例不会自己跑掉。”党的庐山会议后，我们革命师生
  对彭德怀的反动嘴脸看清楚了，对彭德怀及其死党恨
  透了，我们坚决维护庐山会议的英明决议，奋起毛泽东
  思想的千钧棒，砸了“平江起义室”，毁了彭德怀题的
  字。为了更好地维护党的庐山会议的英明决议，我们
  把深入开展批判彭德怀、彻底肃清彭德怀的流毒，作
  为严肃的政治任务和长期的阶级斗争。现在，我们全
  县和全校开展了一个彻底肃清中国赫鲁晓夫、彭德怀
  及其死党流毒的群众运动，并要把它持续下去。
      “宜将剩勇追穷寇，不可沽名学霸王。”参加座谈会的同志一致表示，决心更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，发扬痛打落水狗的彻底革命精神，打倒中国赫鲁晓夫，打倒彭德怀！批臭黑《怒潮》！夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利！　周全胜、侯业扬整理（附图片）
