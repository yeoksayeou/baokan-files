With the latest instructions from our most beloved and great leader Chairman Mao, we are taught: "The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is, in essence, a great political revolution carried out by the proletariat against the bourgeoisie and all exploiting classes in the condition of socialism. It is a continuation of the long-term struggle between the Chinese Communist Party and the broad revolutionary masses led by it and the reactionary Kuomintang. It is a continuation of the class struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie." This latest instruction further elucidates the great significance of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and deeply reveals its class content. It is like a lighthouse shining brightly, further illuminating the victorious course of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. It points out the direction for the proletarian revolutionary factions and the broad revolutionary masses to advance, serving as our great commander Mao's battle cry to seize the comprehensive victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in the new situation of class struggle. It is also our most sharp weapon to counter rightist conservatism, rightist splitism, and rightist capitulationism.

We, the proletarian revolutionary factions of Qinghai Province, with boundless love, faith, admiration, and loyalty to our great leader Chairman Mao, warmly hail the issuance of Chairman Mao's latest instructions. Over a year of intense class struggle has made us deeply feel that Mao Zedong Thought is our most powerful ideological weapon to defeat all class enemies. Chairman Mao's series of latest instructions on the Cultural Revolution are the great blueprint for continuing the revolution under the conditions of proletarian dictatorship. They are the fundamental guarantee to prevent revisionism, consolidate proletarian dictatorship, and prevent capitalist restoration. We must study this extremely important latest instruction carefully, understand it deeply, and regard it as the criterion for struggle and the guide for action. We must follow it word for word and sentence for sentence.

Currently, Qinghai, like the rest of the country, is bathed in the glorious light of Mao Zedong Thought, with a very good situation that is getting better and better. Mao Zedong Thought has been widely spread and popularized to an unprecedented extent. The revolutionary criticism is raging like a fire, revolutionary great alliances are becoming more consolidated, and revolutionary three-in-one combinations are developing unprecedentedly. We have basically achieved a red tide across the province, and both revolution and production have presented a new situation. The entire Qinghai Plateau is vibrant and thriving with a revolutionary scene.

However, class struggle has not ended, and the class enemies will not readily accept their defeat. They will still struggle desperately. Currently, a small handful of stubborn reactionaries and traitors and spies who have infiltrated the Party, in collusion with the remaining reactionary remnants of the Kuomintang in society, have stirred up a rightist reversal trend in some places. They have raised the flag of the bourgeois reactionary line again, directing their spears at the proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao, at the great steel wall of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, and at the newly born revolutionary committees. They secretly conspire, plot behind the scenes, create counter-revolutionary public opinion, and attempt to negate the unprecedented achievements of the Cultural Revolution. They attempt to negate the direction of our struggle of the August 18th proletarian revolutionary factions, labeling conservative organizations as "erroneous old rebels," so as to regroup their factions. The remaining reactionary remnants of the Kuomintang in society are also taking advantage of the opportunity to negate the great achievements of all political movements since liberation, stirring up a reversal trend. A large number of facts of class struggle fully illustrate that the main danger at present is rightist conservatism, rightist splitism, and rightist capitulationism.

Chairman Mao's latest brilliant instructions have greatly boosted the morale of the proletarian revolutionary factions nationwide, greatly suppressed the arrogance of the bourgeoisie, and inspired hundreds of millions of revolutionary masses to raise high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, to strike back at the counter-revolutionary restoration tide head-on, and to seize the comprehensive victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

Class enemies are some extraordinarily stupid fellows. "They always overestimate their own strength and underestimate ours." They have also misjudged the situation. No matter how cunning and "clever" their counter-revolutionary strategies are, in the face of the proletarian revolutionary factions armed with the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, in the face of the powerful proletarian dictatorship, the new counter-attack of this small handful of class enemies is merely the buzzing of a few dying flies before they freeze to death. In the end, they will only "lift a stone to drop on their own feet" and meet a shameful end.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "The rights obtained by the people must not be easily lost and must be defended by struggle." We, the August 18th proletarian revolutionary factions of Qinghai, must always remember Chairman Mao's latest instructions, grasp the direction of struggle, and focus on class struggle. We must focus on the struggle between the two classes, the two roads, and the two lines, and continue to launch sustained attacks on the handful of capitalist roaders within the Party, led by China's Khrushchev, and their agents in Qinghai. We must carry out the revolutionary criticism deeply and sustainably. We must firmly oppose rightist conservatism, rightist splitism, and rightist capitulationism, strike back at the rightist reversal trend head-on, and smash all the plots of the class enemies. We must expose all those who pretend to support the revolution but actually oppose it, all the two-faced counter-revolutionaries, all the chameleons, and all the little crawlers. We must fight them down and expose their stench thoroughly.

We must forever be loyal to Chairman Mao, forever loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, and forever loyal to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. We will fight for Chairman Mao's revolutionary line while alive and die for it. We vow to defend Chairman Mao, to defend the proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao, and to defend the newly born revolutionary committees. Riding the east wind, we will carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to the end and seize the comprehensive victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

    以毛主席最新指示为武器彻底粉碎右倾翻案风
    青海省八·一八无产阶级革命派联合委员会
    我们最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席最近教导我们：“无产阶级文化大革命，实质上是在社会主义条件下，无产阶级反对资产阶级和一切剥削阶级的政治大革命，是中国共产党及其领导下的广大革命人民群众和国民党反动派长期斗争的继续，是无产阶级和资产阶级阶级斗争的继续。”这一最新指示，进一步阐明了无产阶级文化大革命的伟大意义，深刻地揭示了文化大革命的阶级内容。它象一座光芒四射的灯塔，进一步照亮了无产阶级文化大革命的胜利航程，给无产阶级革命派和广大革命群众指明了前进的方向，是我们伟大统帅毛主席在阶级斗争新形势下，向我们发出的夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的战斗号令，也是我们当前反击右倾保守主义、右倾分裂主义和右倾投降主义的最锐利的思想武器。
    我们青海省八·一八无产阶级革命派，怀着对伟大领袖毛主席无限热爱、无限信仰、无限崇拜、无限忠诚的阶级感情，热烈欢呼毛主席这一最新指示的发表。一年多惊心动魄的阶级斗争实践，使我们深深体会到：毛泽东思想是我们战胜一切阶级敌人的最强大的思想武器。毛主席关于文化大革命的一系列最新指示，是在无产阶级专政条件下，继续进行革命的伟大纲领，是反修防修，巩固无产阶级专政，防止资本主义复辟的根本保证。对于毛主席这一极其重要的最新指示，我们一定要认真学习，深刻领会，把它作为斗争的准则，行动的指南，字字照办，句句照办。
    当前，我们青海和全国一样，在毛泽东思想的光辉照耀下，形势一片大好，而且越来越好。毛泽东思想得到了空前的大传播、大普及，革命大批判如火如荼，革命大联合日益巩固，革命三结合空前发展，基本上实现了全省一片红，革命和生产都出现了崭新的局面，整个青海高原呈现着一片生气勃勃、欣欣向荣的革命景象。
    但是，阶级斗争并没有结束，阶级敌人绝不会甘心他们的失败，他们还要作垂死的挣扎。目前一小撮顽固不化的走资派和混进党内的叛徒、特务，勾结社会上残留下来的国民党反动派余孽，在某些地方掀起了一股右倾翻案妖风，他们又扯起了资产阶级反动路线的破旗，把矛头指向以毛主席为首的无产阶级司令部，指向伟大的钢铁长城中国人民解放军，指向新生的革命委员会。他们秘密串连，幕后策划，大造反革命舆论，妄图否定史无前例的文化大革命的丰功伟绩，否定我们八·一八无产阶级革命派的斗争大方向，把保守组织说成是“犯错误的老造反派”，以便重新拉起山头。社会上残留下来的国民党反动派的余孽，也伺机反扑，妄图否定解放以来历次政治运动的伟大成绩，大刮翻案妖风。大量的阶级斗争的事实，充分说明了当前的主要危险是右倾保守主义、右倾分裂主义和右倾投降主义。
    毛主席的最新英明指示，大长了全国无产阶级革命派的志气，大灭了资产阶级的威风，鼓舞着亿万革命群众，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，迎头痛击反革命复辟逆流，夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利。
    阶级敌人是一些笨得出奇的家伙，“他们总是高估了自己的力量，低估了我们的力量。”他们又错误地估计了形势。不管他们多么阴险狡猾，不管他们反革命策略多么“高明”，但是，在用战无不胜的毛泽东思想武装起来的无产阶级革命派面前，在强大的无产阶级专政面前，这一小撮阶级敌人的新反扑，只不过是几只碰壁的苍蝇在冻死之前发出的嗡嗡悲鸣，到头来只能是“搬起石头打自己的脚”，落个可耻的下场。
    毛主席教导我们：“人民得到的权利，绝不允许轻易丧失，必须用战斗来保卫。”我们青海八·一八无产阶级革命派，一定要牢记毛主席的最新指示，掌握斗争的大方向，狠抓阶级斗争，狠抓两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的斗争，向以中国赫鲁晓夫为首的党内最大的一小撮走资派及其在青海的代理人继续发动持久的进攻，把革命的大批判深入地持久地开展下去。坚定地反对右倾保守主义、右倾分裂主义和右倾投降主义，迎头痛击右倾翻案的妖风，彻底粉碎阶级敌人一切阴谋活动，把那些伪装拥护革命而实际反对革命的反革命两面派统统揪出来，把一切变色龙、小爬虫统统揪出来，彻底斗倒，批臭。
    我们要永远忠于毛主席，永远忠于毛泽东思想，永远忠于毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，生为毛主席革命路线而战斗，死为毛主席革命路线而献身。誓死保卫毛主席，誓死保卫以毛主席为首的无产阶级司令部，誓死保卫新生的革命委员会，乘浩荡的东风，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底，夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利。
