The revolutionary people of Hunan, numbering 38 million, are enthusiastically celebrating the birth of the Hunan Provincial Revolutionary Committee. They are repeatedly studying and understanding the latest directive from our great leader Chairman Mao, transmitted in the editorial of the People's Daily and the Liberation Army Daily: "The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is, in essence, a great political revolution carried out by the proletariat under the conditions of socialism to criticize and repudiate the bourgeoisie and all other exploiting classes, and it is a continuation of the long-term struggle between the Chinese Communist Party and the Kuomintang reactionaries led by the broad revolutionary masses. It is a continuation of the class struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie."

They resolve to follow Chairman Mao's great teachings, firmly grasp the direction of the struggle, never forget the struggle between the two classes, the two roads, and the two lines, deeply and persistently carry out the revolutionary criticism, and launch a relentless attack on the handful of capitalist roaders within the Party, headed by China's Khrushchev, and their agents in Hunan, to achieve a comprehensive victory in the Cultural Revolution.

The Hunan Provincial Revolutionary Committee issued a notice today, requiring all primary-level units to organize the broad masses of revolutionary cadres and the people to seriously study the latest directive from Chairman Mao transmitted in the editorial of the People's Daily and the Liberation Army Daily, "The Dawn Spreads Over the Land of Chrysanthemums." The Provincial Revolutionary Committee held a standing committee meeting to seriously study and discuss Chairman Mao's latest directive. Reviewing the great struggle of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, everyone has a deeper understanding that Chairman Mao's latest directive profoundly points out the great significance of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, reveals its class content, and provides revolutionary people with a new and extremely powerful ideological weapon. The committee members said that the various crimes committed by the handful of capitalist roaders within the Party, headed by China's Khrushchev, and their agents in Hunan such as Wang Yanchun, fully illustrate that they represent the interests of the Kuomintang reactionaries, that is, the bourgeoisie and the landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists. In the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the proletarian headquarters headed by Chairman Mao, together with the broad revolutionary cadres and the people, have exposed this handful of traitors, spies, and die-hard capitalist roaders, greatly consolidating our proletarian dictatorship. This is a great victory for Mao Zedong Thought and a great victory for Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. The committee members unanimously expressed that they will definitely remember Chairman Mao's great teachings, never relax their revolutionary vigilance, and resolutely lead the revolutionary cadres and the people of the entire province to follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, to achieve a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

Over a thousand representatives from various regions of the province who attended the celebration of the establishment of the Hunan Provincial Revolutionary Committee, with excited hearts, repeatedly studied and discussed Chairman Mao's latest directive. They said, Chairman Mao's latest directive has once again pointed out the direction for our victorious advance. We must continue to mobilize the masses to launch an attack on the handful of capitalist roaders within the Party, headed by China's Khrushchev, and their agents in Hunan. We must fully expose the reactionary line of the bourgeoisie. We must strongly criticize the rightist wind of reversing verdicts. We must strengthen our awareness of the enemy, sharpen our eyes, and be good at distinguishing those who pretend to support the revolution but actually oppose it, thoroughly smashing all their evil plots to shake and split the proletarian headquarters headed by Chairman Mao.

Chairman Mao's latest directive has greatly educated and inspired the 38 million heroic sons and daughters of Hunan. The father of the internationalist warrior Luo Shengjiao, a martyr, and a member of the Hunan Provincial Revolutionary Committee, Luo Diekai, said with great excitement, Chairman Mao's latest directive speaks to the heart of us poor and lower-middle peasants. We must never forget class struggle, never forget proletarian dictatorship. We must follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, firmly grasp the struggle between the two classes, the two roads, and the two lines, launch a relentless attack on the class enemy, and achieve a comprehensive victory in the Cultural Revolution. The revolutionary workers of the New China Printing Plant said, We must increase our revolutionary vigilance a hundredfold, resolutely strike down the rightist wind of reversing verdicts, firmly oppose rightist conservatism, rightist splitism, and rightist capitulationism, and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end. When Chairman Mao's latest directive reached the Xiangtan County Shaoshan People's Commune, the broad poor and lower-middle peasants, revolutionary cadres, and Red Guards, who were enthusiastically celebrating the glorious birth of the Provincial Revolutionary Committee, were extremely excited. They unanimously expressed that they would definitely follow Chairman Mao's words, never forget class struggle, and swear to carry out the "political revolution of the proletariat against the bourgeoisie and all exploiting classes" to the end.

At the celebrations held in various prefectures, cities, and many counties to commemorate the establishment of the Provincial Revolutionary Committee, revolutionary cadres and the people expressed that they would firmly defend the revolutionary authority of the Revolutionary Committee, obey its correct leadership, cherish it, support it, and help it to develop and improve in the class struggle. Under the correct leadership of the Provincial Revolutionary Committee, they will further comprehensively implement Chairman Mao's latest directive, consolidate and develop the revolutionary great alliance and the revolutionary three-in-one combination, do a good job in the struggle, criticism, and transformation of their units, resolutely implement Chairman Mao's great policy of "grasp revolution, promote production," and achieve new victories in revolution and production.

The revolutionary masses in various places, while celebrating the establishment of the Provincial Revolutionary Committee, enthusiastically praised the great merits of the PLA troops stationed in Hunan in the "three supports, two militaries" work, and expressed their determination to further respond to Chairman Mao's great call of "support the army and love the people," learn from the People's Liberation Army, actively support and help the PLA do a good job in the "three supports, two militaries" work, and achieve a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution with military-civilian unity.

    毛主席的最新指示给湖南省三千八百万英雄儿女以极大的教育，极大的鼓舞。国际主义战士罗盛教烈士的父亲、湖南省革委会委员罗迭开万分激动地说，毛主席的最新指示，字字句句说到我们贫下中农的心坎上。我们千万不能忘记阶级斗争，千万不能忘记无产阶级专政。我们要紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，狠抓两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的斗争，向阶级敌人发起猛烈的进攻，夺取文化大革命的全面胜利。新华印刷厂的广大革命职工说，我们要百倍提高革命警惕，坚决痛击右倾翻案妖风，坚定地反对右倾保守主义、右倾分裂主义和右倾投降主义，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。当毛主席的最新指示传到湘潭县韶山人民公社时，正在热烈庆祝省革委会光荣诞生的广大贫下中农、革命干部和红卫兵小将，万分激动。他们一致表示，坚决听毛主席的话，念念不忘阶级斗争，誓把“无产阶级反对资产阶级和一切剥削阶级的政治大革命”进行到底。
    在各专区、市和许多县分别举行的庆祝省革命委员会成立的大会上，无产阶级革命派、革命群众纷纷表示，坚决地维护革命委员会的无产阶级革命权威，服从革命委员会的正确领导，爱护它，支持它，帮助它在阶级斗争中不断地发展和完善。要在省革命委员会的正确领导下，进一步全面落实毛主席的最新指示，巩固和发展革命大联合和革命三结合，搞好本单位的斗批改，坚决贯彻毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的伟大方针，夺取革命、生产的新胜利。
