Chairman Mao's declaration speaks for our hearts.
People of all countries cheer Chairman Mao's great declaration.

	Sri Lankan friends enthusiastically cheer Chairman Mao's support for the struggle of American blacks against violence.
	The chairman of the Afro-Asian Solidarity Association of Sri Lanka, Mrs. Teja Gunawadana, said to a Xinhua News Agency correspondent on the 20th: Chairman Mao's declaration of support for the struggle of American blacks against violence will strengthen the international unity of the people of all countries who are fighting for true freedom and national independence.
	Worker Fernando said, Chairman Mao's declaration is a document of historical significance. He said, this declaration not only inspires the struggle of blacks but also calls on the people of the world to intensify the struggle against imperialism led by the United States. All the workers and revolutionary people of the world will respond to Chairman Mao's wise call. The representative of the South West Africa People's Organization in Cairo, Nandavi Katoto, said in Dar es Salaam on the 18th to a Xinhua News Agency correspondent:

	"The great leader Chairman Mao recently issued a declaration supporting the struggle of American blacks against violence, which is a resounding call to the oppressed blacks in the United States, urging them to unite, take up arms, and overthrow the reactionary rule of the American monopolistic bourgeoisie. This declaration is also a great inspiration to the revolutionary people of the world." Katoto continued, "Chairman Mao pointed out: 'American imperialism is rampant everywhere, putting itself in a position of enmity with the people of the whole world, making itself more and more isolated. The atomic bombs and hydrogen bombs in the hands of American imperialism cannot frighten all those who do not want to be slaves. The tide of the people of the world against American aggressors is irresistible.' This brilliant conclusion has been proven by the American blacks who are fighting and by other peoples of various countries who are fighting for liberation and freedom." Katoto said: "The South West Africa People's Organization highly praises Chairman Mao's declaration. The people of South West Africa will follow Chairman Mao's teaching of 'political power grows out of the barrel of a gun' and continue our struggle until the final liberation."

	Finally, Katoto shouted: "Long live Mao Zedong Thought! Long live Chairman Mao! Wish Chairman Mao eternal life!" A freedom fighter from Cameroon said in Algiers on the 18th to a Xinhua News Agency correspondent: "We wholeheartedly support and firmly endorse Chairman Mao Zedong's declaration. His declaration speaks for our hearts." He pointed out: "Non-violent advocates are always subjected to the persecution of counter-revolutionary violence. Revolutionary people must resolutely abandon non-violence and resolutely abandon the fallacy of 'peaceful transition' advocated by revisionism. Chairman Mao has long pointed out: 'Political power grows out of the barrel of a gun.' This is a great truth." A West Indian worker in Britain issued a statement on the 19th, pointing out that Chairman Mao's declaration illuminates the direction of the struggle of American blacks with Marxism-Leninism. This is another major contribution to Marxism-Leninism, a major contribution to the cause of the struggle of American blacks, and a great inspiration to the oppressed people of the United States and the world. The statement condemns the Soviet revisionist leadership clique for "shamefully colluding with the American imperialist ruling clique, actually supporting the enemy of the oppressed American blacks and the enemy of the oppressed people of the world." The statement expresses that the revolutionary West Indian workers in Britain resolutely respond to Chairman Mao's call to "take action and give strong support to the struggle of American blacks," actively propagate Chairman Mao's declaration, organize various activities to support the struggle of American blacks, and at the same time launch a struggle against imperialist and racist oppression in Britain.

    毛主席声明说出了我们心里话
    各国人民齐声欢呼毛主席的伟大声明
    锡兰朋友热情欢呼伟大领袖毛主席支持美国黑人抗暴斗争的声明。
    锡兰亚非团结协会主席特加·古纳瓦达纳夫人二十日对新华社记者说：毛主席支持美国黑人抗暴斗争的声明，将加强正在为争取真正的自由和民族独立而斗争的各国人民的国际团结。
    工人费尔南多说，毛主席的声明是具有历史意义的文件。他说，这个声明不仅鼓舞着黑人的斗争，而且号召世界人民加紧反对以美国为首的帝国主义的斗争。全世界工人和其他革命人民必将响应毛主席这一英明的号召。西南非洲民族联盟驻开罗代表南达维贾·卡苏托十八日在达累斯萨拉姆对新华社记者说：
  “伟大领袖毛主席最近发表的支持美国黑人抗暴斗争的声明，是对美国的被压迫黑人的响亮号召，号召他们团结起来，拿起武器，推翻美国垄断资产阶级的反动统治。这个声明也是对全世界革命人民的巨大鼓舞。”卡苏托继续说，毛主席指出：“美帝国主义到处横行霸道，把它自己放在同全世界人民为敌的地位，使它自己越来越陷于孤立。美帝国主义手里的原子弹、氢弹，是吓不倒一切不愿意做奴隶的人们的。全世界人民反对美国侵略者的怒潮是不可阻挡的。”这个光辉的论断已经由正在斗争的美国黑人和为争取解放和自由而斗争的其他各国人民所证实了。卡苏托说：“西南非洲民族联盟高度赞扬毛主席的声明。西南非洲人民将按照毛主席‘枪杆子里面出政权’的教导，继续我们的斗争，直到最后解放。”
    最后，卡苏托高呼：“毛泽东思想万岁！”“毛主席万岁！”“祝毛主席万寿无疆！”喀麦隆一位自由战士十八日在阿尔及尔对新华社记者说：“我们衷心拥护、坚决支持毛泽东主席的声明，他的声明说出了我们的心里话。”他指出：“非暴力主义者总是受到反革命暴力的迫害。革命的人民一定要坚决地抛弃非暴力主义，坚决地抛弃修正主义的‘和平过渡’的谬论。毛主席早就指出：‘枪杆子里面出政权’。这是一个伟大的真理。”旅英西印度群岛工人十九日发表声明指出，毛主席的声明用马克思列宁主义的光芒指明了美国黑人斗争的方向。这是对马克思列宁主义的又一个新的重大贡献，是对美国黑人斗争事业的重大贡献，也是对美国和全世界被压迫人民的巨大鼓舞。声明谴责苏联修正主义领导集团“可耻地同美帝国主义统治集团勾结，实际上在支持被压迫的美国黑人的敌人和世界被压迫人民的敌人”。声明表示，在英国的革命的西印度群岛工人坚决响应毛主席提出的“行动起来，给予美国黑人的斗争以强大的声援”的号召，积极宣传毛主席的声明，组织各种活动来支持美国黑人的斗争，同时在英国展开反对帝国主义和种族主义压迫的斗争。（据新华社）
