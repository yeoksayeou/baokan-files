The revolutionary cadres of Ningcheng County in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region seized power from a handful of capitalist roaders within the Party during the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and established the Revolutionary Committee in October of last year.

In the course of struggle, we deeply realized: seizing power relies on Mao Zedong Thought, and holding power also relies on Mao Zedong Thought. Therefore, after the establishment of the County Revolutionary Committee, we launched a mass movement to study and apply Mao Zedong Thought extensively throughout the county, established Mao Zedong Thought study classes, and propagated and implemented Chairman Mao's latest instructions thoroughly. As Comrade Lin Biao said:

"When Mao Zedong Thought is grasped by the broad masses, it will become an inexhaustible force, a spiritual atom bomb of tremendous power." In Ningcheng, the broad masses wielded Mao Zedong Thought, this weapon of tremendous power, to fight against class enemies, to fight against nature, and to fight against the "self" in their minds. The entire county presented a new situation where Mao Zedong Thought is widely popularized, revolutionary spirit is greatly promoted, the masses are fully mobilized, military-civilian unity is strengthened, relations between officials and the people are improved, the dictatorship of the proletariat is consolidated, and agricultural, pastoral, and industrial production are developed. Truly, Mao Zedong Thought illuminates Ningcheng, and the banks of the Old Harha River are red.

We focused on class education, emphasized loyalty, and raised the consciousness of studying Chairman Mao's works.

In organizing the mass movement to study and apply Mao Zedong Thought among cadres and the masses, we first focused on class education and extensively carried out the "three remembrances, three comparisons, and one excavation" activities. That is, remembering the bitterness of the old society and comparing it with the sweetness of the new society; remembering the bitterness of the capitalist roaders' line and comparing it with the sweetness of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line; remembering the Party and Chairman Mao's cultivation and comparing it with one's own contributions to the Party and the people; and excavating the roots of selfishness. Offices, factories, schools, and peasant households all carried out these activities. Old workers and old poor peasants recounted their history of exploitation and liberation, old cadres recounted the changes before and after land reform and collectivization, demobilized soldiers recounted their history of southern and northern campaigns, and state cadres recounted the Party and Chairman Mao's cultivation and education of them. In this way, class education and education in loyalty to Chairman Mao were closely combined, greatly raising the class consciousness of cadres and the masses in being eternally loyal to Chairman Mao.

In the study classes held by the County Revolutionary Committee, some cadres who had taken the wrong side in the past revealed thoughts of relying on past merits and could not correctly treat the masses and themselves. We organized comrades with a background of hard labor to remember bitterness and compare sweetness. Through remembering bitterness and comparing sweetness, the cadres who had taken the wrong side checked their mistakes and excavated the root of their erroneous thoughts. They said: "This mistake, that mistake, the greatest mistake is disloyalty to Chairman Mao." Eighteen leaders of communes voluntarily formed a group, stood in front of Chairman Mao's portrait, and raised their hands to swear: "Eliminate selfishness, bury the character for revisionism, heaven and earth may change, rocks may crumble, but my red heart loyal to you will never change." Poor peasant Yu Zhenlin of Daxing Production Brigade said during remembrance and comparison: "In the old society, three members of my family worked for the landlord, exploited by the landlord to the point of not having enough to eat or wear; now the kang is covered with new mats, the walls are plastered with white clay, and the windows are installed with new glass. The bitterness of the past was the evil of the three great mountains, and the good life today is given by Chairman Mao. If we do not listen to Chairman Mao's words, we will be ungrateful to him and will go back to the old road." County model in studying Chairman Mao's works, Zheng Xirong, before liberation was carried by his father from Hebei in a flower basket. The Japanese devils gathered families and drove them into "human cages." He contracted smallpox and lost his eyesight. He said during remembrance of bitterness: "The evil old society took away my eyesight, and Chairman Mao made me see the light again. Although my eyes cannot see anything, my heart has a red sun, shining brightly!"

Through class education, the masses' class feelings for Chairman Mao became deeper and deeper, and from the heart, they realized that "father and mother are not as dear as Chairman Mao." At this time, we extensively discussed the great significance of Mao Zedong Thought, organized the masses to study Comrade Lin Biao's statements about Mao Zedong Thought, and combined it with the history of the Chinese revolution and the changes in the world situation to extensively carry out discussions. Through study, the masses realized: Chairman Mao is the great banner of the world's revolutionary people. Mao Zedong Thought is the highest level of Marxism-Leninism in contemporary times. Whether or not to study Mao Zedong Thought is not a personal matter, but a major matter of the revolution, the state, and the people. With Mao Zedong Thought, we have everything; without Mao Zedong Thought, we lose everything. "Mao Zedong Thought is a priceless treasure, we cannot be without it for a moment."

More than thirty women of the First Production Brigade of Daxing Production Brigade discussed why they should study Mao Zedong Thought. They said: "In the old society, we women had no status at all. It was only because of Mao Zedong Thought that the proletariat seized political power, and we became masters of the house. If we do not study Mao Zedong Thought, we will not know how the country changes color and will return to the old road of the old society." Seventy-two-year-old old man Yang Maozhi of Hongxing Production Brigade, after study, lay on the kang at night and thought period by period, and finally understood. He said to everyone: "I have lived for more than seventy years and feel that the happiest thing is to have Chairman Mao as such a wise and great leader. Chairman Mao's words are all truths, said once and done, all realized. Studying Chairman Mao's works is truly more important than anything else. Chairman Mao's books are revolutionary treasure books, I will study them until I die."

We also organized the masses to extensively study Chairman Mao's great revolutionary practice and understand Chairman Mao's unparalleled great contributions in decades of revolutionary struggle. The more they studied, the more they felt Chairman Mao's wisdom and greatness. Many comrades were moved to tears, very excited, and checked themselves for not being loyal enough to Chairman Mao, for not studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought well, and for not serving the people thoroughly. Especially in the study classes, after studying Chairman Mao's great revolutionary practice, the education of some cadres who wanted to rely on past merits and had moods was very deep. After study, many people changed their "grievances" into "aspirations." A comrade excitedly said: "The masses pasted a few big-character posters on me, which is caring for me. My thought of throwing down my burden is the greatest disloyalty to Chairman Mao. In the future, I will definitely hold power for the poor and lower-middle peasants and follow Chairman Mao in revolution for life." From then on, he took up the double burden of revolution and production, and worked very well.

To more extensively study Chairman Mao's great revolutionary practice, we also held exhibitions of great leader Chairman Mao's photographs, which toured around. While exhibiting, we also performed artistic programs praising Chairman Mao. Many people eagerly waited to see our great leader Chairman Mao, and this time they saw him. Some people watched it over and over again, reluctant to leave. A woman from Chaoyangwan Production Brigade said to Chairman Mao's benevolent face: "I think of Chairman Mao day and night. This time you, old man, came to the mountains to visit us. You live in our home, and we will always listen to your words."

We adopted various forms and used every opportunity to extensively discuss Mao Zedong Thought, focus on class education, and continuously raise the class consciousness of the masses, deepen their love for the great leader Chairman Mao, and more consciously study Mao Zedong Thought.

We extensively established various types of study classes, emphasized the "use" of knowledge, and fostered a good learning style of revolution.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "If there is a correct theory, but it is only talked about and not put into practice, then no matter how good the theory is, it is meaningless." Comrade Lin Biao also instructs us: "Studying Chairman Mao's works should be done with problems in mind, actively studying and applying them, combining study with use, learning what is urgently needed first, seeing results immediately, and focusing on the 'use' of knowledge." Based on Chairman Mao's teachings and Comrade Lin Biao's instructions, we brought problems from the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, extensively established various types of Mao Zedong Thought study classes, and seriously implemented Chairman Mao's latest instructions.

Since mid-October last year, we have taken establishing various types of study classes as a central task. The study classes are flexible and varied, convenient for production and the masses, and adopt various forms. Currently, the most common type is the study class that combines study with labor and combines cadres with the masses. During the day, cadres and the masses work together, study documents during rest time, and sit together at night to criticize and repent.

In the study classes, we focused on the "use" of knowledge and fostered a revolutionary good learning style of combining theory with practice. In the past, some people had a big gap between study and use. They thought that reciting smoothly and speaking in sets was good study; but they did not pay enough attention to using what they learned. Therefore, we organized everyone to discuss this problem. Everyone realized: whether study is good or not is not judged by words, but by actions. Whether to use what is learned or not is the only standard to judge whether a person studies well or not, and whether a study class is good or not. Using what is learned is truly loyal to Chairman Mao. A community member of Dongwozi Production Brigade was very good at speaking, but did not cherish collective property. After study and discussion, he realized that the root of his learning without using was the "self" causing trouble. From then on, he fiercely fought against the "self," learning a little and using a little. When the grass chopping machine in the brigade was broken and the livestock had no grass to eat, he and four others chopped grass with a sickle, chopping more than a thousand pounds a day, and did not rest even when his hands were blistered. Due to the extensive study and discussion, the awareness of the importance of "use" was raised, and now the wind of learning and using is greatly promoted, and a few verbal revolutionaries who only learned but did not use also changed.

We established different types of Mao Zedong Thought study classes, and for whatever problem needed to be solved, we organized the relevant people to participate. A seed farm has held seven sessions of Mao Zedong Thought study classes, and each session solved a major problem. This farm successively solved the problem of revolutionary great alliance, the problem of liberating cadres, and the problem of eliminating the influence of China's Khrushchev and his agents in the Inner Mongolia region. The secretary of the farm's branch, Zhang Daotong, did not understand the Cultural Revolution at first and argued with the masses without checking his own mistakes. Later, Zhang Daotong participated in the farm's cadre study class. In the study class, revolutionary masses inspired him to remember bitterness and compare sweetness and gave him the language of Chairman Mao: "Do not rely on past merits, but establish new merits." That night, Zhang Daotong did not sleep. He kept thinking about Chairman Mao's teachings, recalling his attitude towards the masses, realizing his mistakes, and writing a self-criticism that night. Because Zhang Daotong took the lead in checking his mistakes, other cadres who wanted to throw down their burdens also fought against the "self" and stood up to do revolution. Some brigades held study classes with the problem of big criticism. They used Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon to fiercely criticize China's Khrushchev's spread of the reactionary revisionist fallacies of "exploitation has merits," "three selfs and one package," and "the extinction of class struggle," making the broad masses see clearly what is Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, what is revisionism; what is the socialist road and what is the capitalist road; what is public and what is private. The first session of the study class of Guangming Commune's Tuanjie Production Brigade solved the cadre problem, and some family members pulled back. They held a study class for cadre family members. Dongsheng's seventh team found that some people fought against the "self" in the brigade's study class but regretted it when they returned home, and the family became a hiding place for the "self." They mobilized the masses to establish family study classes, making the "self" have no place to hide.

In the study classes, we especially emphasized that cadres should take the lead in studying and using. A leading cadre of a commune took the lead in exposing and fighting against the "self" in each session of the study class. The brigade leader of Bajiaodai wanted to throw down his burden and went to the study class. After listening to the leading cadres of the commune exposing and fighting against the "self," he thought: the commune cadres dare to expose and fight against the "self" without fear of shame or pain, why can't I dare to fight against the "self" if I have it? On the third day, he could not hold back and opened his mouth, fighting against the "self" for three hours. That night, he did not go home but went to the brigade to arrange production. Cadres taking the lead in fighting against the "self" also inspired the masses. The masses said: "The village looks at the village, the household looks at the household, and the community members look at the cadres. Cadres dare to expose the 'self,' and community members also dare to fight."

Various types of study classes are all established with advanced people as teachers, using the method of "lecture and use." Whoever learns and uses and sees results immediately is invited to give guidance to everyone. The process of lecture and use is the process of greatly establishing Mao Zedong Thought and greatly criticizing bourgeois thoughts. In this way, not only are models established and people's thoughts revolutionized, but also a new style of "learning and using is glorious, learning and not using is shameful" is formed.

Through bringing problems and extensively establishing various types of Mao Zedong Thought study classes, focusing on the "use" of knowledge, many practical problems were solved. The masses said: "After entering the study class, studying Chairman Mao's latest instructions and the 'Three Articles,' changing selfishness into red heart, many old difficult problems were solved."

Chairman Mao teaches us: "Establishing study classes is a good method, and many problems can be solved in the study classes." We deeply felt from practice: Chairman Mao's instruction is truly extremely wise and extremely correct.

    毛泽东思想照宁城　老哈河畔红彤彤
    内蒙古自治区宁城县革命委员会副主任　姚瑞忠
    我们宁城县的无产阶级革命派，在无产阶级文化大革命运动中，夺了党内一小撮走资派的权，在去年十月间建立了革命委员会。
    在斗争实践中，我们深深认识到：夺权靠毛泽东思想，掌权也要靠毛泽东思想。因此，县革命委员会成立以后，在全县广泛开展了活学活用毛泽东思想的群众运动，大办毛泽东思想学习班，深入地宣传、贯彻毛主席的最新指示。正象林副主席所说的：
  “毛泽东思想为广大群众所掌握，就会变成无穷无尽的力量，变成威力无比的精神原子弹。”在宁城，广大群众运用毛泽东思想这个威力无比的武器，同阶级敌人斗，同大自然斗，同自己头脑里的“私”字斗，全县出现了毛泽东思想大普及，革命精神大发扬，人民群众大发动，军民大团结，干群关系大改善，无产阶级专政大巩固，工农牧生产大发展的新局面。真是：毛泽东思想照宁城，老哈河畔红彤彤。
    狠抓阶级教育，突出一个“忠”字，提高学习毛主席著作的自觉性
    在组织广大干部和群众活学活用毛泽东思想的群众运动中，我们首先狠抓了阶级教育，广泛开展了“三忆、三比、一挖”活动。即：忆旧社会的苦，比新社会的甜；忆中国赫鲁晓夫资产阶级反动路线的苦，比毛主席无产阶级革命路线的甜；忆党和毛主席对自己的培养，比自己对党和人民的贡献；一挖就是挖私根。机关、厂矿、学校、社员家庭都开展了这一活动。老工人、老贫农讲被剥削史、翻身史，老干部讲土改、集体化前后变化史，荣复转业军人讲南征北战史，国家干部讲党和毛主席对自己的培养教育史，这样把阶级教育和忠于毛主席的教育，紧密地结合在一起，极大地提高了广大干部、群众永远忠于毛主席的阶级觉悟。
    在县革命委员会举办的学习班里，有些过去站错队的县社干部，暴露出有吃老本的思想，不能正确地对待群众和自己。我们就组织扛大活出身的同志忆苦思甜。通过忆苦思甜，站错队的干部检查了自己的错误，挖出了错误的思想根源。他们说：“这错误，那错误，对毛主席的不忠是最大的错误。”十八名公社领导干部，自动结合起来，站在毛主席像前举手宣誓：“铲除私字，埋葬修字，天翻地覆，海枯石烂，忠于您老人家的红心永不变。”大兴大队贫农于振林，在回忆对比的时候说：“旧社会我家三个人给地主扛活，被地主剥削得吃不上、穿不上，那时炕上铺的是桦树皮，磨着肉皮；如今炕上铺的是新炕席，墙上刷的白土泥，窗户上安的新玻璃。过去的苦是三座大山的罪恶，今天的好生活是毛主席给的，不听毛主席的话，就对不起他老人家，就要走回头路。”县的学习毛主席著作标兵郑喜荣，解放前是他父亲用花箩筐把他从河北挑过来的，日本鬼子集家并户，把他们赶到“人圈”里，他生了天花，瞎了双眼。他忆苦时说：“万恶的旧社会夺去了我的双眼，毛主席使我重见光明。别看我眼睛看不着啥，可是我心里有颗红太阳，亮得很！”
    通过阶级教育，广大群众对毛主席的阶级感情越来越深厚，从心眼里认识到“爹亲娘亲不如毛主席亲”。这时，我们又大讲毛泽东思想的伟大意义，组织群众学习林彪副主席关于毛泽东思想的论述，联系中国革命的历史和世界形势的变化，广泛开展讨论。通过学习，群众认识到：毛主席是世界革命人民的伟大旗手。毛泽东思想是当代最高水平的马克思列宁主义。学不学毛泽东思想，不是个人的事情，而是革命的大事，国家的大事，人民的大事。有了毛泽东思想就有了一切，丢掉毛泽东思想就丧失一切。“毛泽东思想是无价宝，一时一刻离不了。”
    大兴大队第一生产队三十多名妇女讨论了为什么要学习毛泽东思想？她们说：“我们妇女在旧社会没有一点地位。就是靠毛泽东思想，无产阶级掌握了政权，我们才当家作主的。不学习毛泽东思想，国家变了颜色也不知道怎么变的，那就要回到旧社会的老路上去。”红星大队七十二岁的老人杨茂芝，经过学习，黑夜躺在炕上，一个时期一个时期地想，想开了窍。他对大伙说：“我活了七十多岁，感到最幸福的是有了毛主席这么英明伟大的领袖。毛主席说的话，句句是真理，说一不二，都实现了。学习毛主席著作真是比什么都重要。毛主席的书是革命宝书，我要活到老，学到老。”
    我们还大力组织群众学习毛主席的伟大革命实践，了解毛主席在几十年革命斗争中无可比拟的伟大贡献。大家越学越感到毛主席的英明伟大。许多同志热泪盈眶，非常激动，纷纷检查自己对毛主席的忠诚还不够，活学活用毛泽东思想还不好，为人民服务还不彻底。特别是在学习班里，学习了毛主席的伟大革命实践，对一些想吃老本、闹情绪的干部教育极深。经过学习，很多人把“怨气”换成了“志气”。有个同志激动地说：“群众给我贴几张大字报，是爱护我。我的撂挑子思想，就是对毛主席最大的不忠。今后我决心为贫下中农掌好权，跟毛主席他老人家闹一辈子革命。”从此，他挑起革命、生产两副重担，工作干得很好。
    为了更广泛地学习毛主席的伟大革命实践，我们还举办了伟大领袖毛主席的照片展览，巡回展出。一边展览，一边表演歌颂毛主席的文艺节目。许多人天天盼望看见我们的伟大领袖毛主席，这回可看见了。有的看了一遍又一遍，恋恋不舍，总是不愿意离开。朝阳湾大队有一位妇女对着毛主席的慈祥面容说：“我黑夜白日想见毛主席，这回您老人家到山里来看望我们来了，您就住在我们家吧，我们永远听您的话。”
    我们采取了各种形式，利用一切机会，大讲毛泽东思想，狠抓阶级教育，使广大群众的阶级觉悟不断提高，对伟大领袖毛主席的热爱更加深厚，学习毛泽东思想更加自觉。
    大办各种学习班，突出一个“用”字，树立革命的好学风
    毛主席教导我们说：“如果有了正确的理论，只是把它空谈一阵，束之高阁，并不实行，那末，这种理论再好也是没有意义的。”林副主席也指示我们：“学习毛主席著作，要带着问题学，活学活用，学用结合，急用先学，立竿见影，在‘用’字上狠下功夫。”根据毛主席的教导和林副主席的指示，我们带着无产阶级文化大革命中的问题，大办各种类型的毛泽东思想学习班，认真落实毛主席的最新指示。
    从去年十月中旬开始，我们就把大办各种类型的学习班，当成一项中心任务。学习班因地因时因人制宜，从便利生产、便利群众出发，采用灵活多样的形式。当前比较普遍的是学习和劳动结合、干部和群众结合的学习班。白天干部和群众一起劳动，休息时间学习文件，晚上坐在一起斗私批修。
    在学习班里，我们突出地抓了一个“用”字，树立理论联系实际的革命好学风。过去有些人学习和使用有很大距离。他们认为，念得顺当，讲起来一套一套的，就是学得好；但是对学了就用，不够重视。因此，我们组织大家讨论了这个问题。大家认识到：学好没学好不在嘴上，而在行动上。学了用不用，这是衡量一个人学习得好坏，一个学习班办得好坏的唯一标准。学了就用，这才是真正忠于毛主席。东洼子大队有个社员非常能讲，但对集体财产很不爱护。经过学习讨论，他认识到自己学了不用，根源是“私”字作怪。从此，他狠斗“私”字，学一点用一点。队里铡草机坏了，牲口没草喂，他就和四个人一起用铡刀铡草，一天铡了一千多斤，手磨出了血也不休息。由于广泛开展了学习讨论，提高了对“用”字的认识，现在学了就用的风气大大发扬，少数光学不用的口头革命派也转变了。
    我们办不同类型的毛泽东思想学习班，需要解决什么问题，就组织什么人参加。有个良种场已经办了七期毛泽东思想学习班，一期学习班解决一个主要问题。这个场先后解决了革命大联合问题、解放干部问题、肃清中国赫鲁晓夫和他在内蒙古地区代理人的流毒问题。这个场的支部书记张道桐，开始对文化大革命不理解，和群众“顶牛”，不检查自己的错误。后来，张道桐参加了场里的干部学习班。在学习班上，革命群众启发他忆苦思甜，还送给他“不要吃老本，要立新功”的毛主席语录。这一宿，张道桐没有睡着觉。他翻来复去想着毛主席的教导，回想自己对群众的态度，认识到自己错了，连夜写了检查。由于张道桐带头检查，其他一些要撂挑子的干部也纷纷斗私，站起来干革命。有的大队带着大批判的问题办学习班。他们以毛泽东思想为武器，狠批中国赫鲁晓夫散布的“剥削有功”、“三自一包”、“阶级斗争熄灭”论等反革命修正主义谬论，使广大群众认清了什么是马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想，什么是修正主义；什么是社会主义道路，什么是资本主义道路；什么是公，什么是私。光明公社团结大队第一期学习班解决了干部问题，有的家属又拉后腿。他们就办干部家属学习班。东升七队发现有些人在队里学习班斗私，回家以后又“后悔”，家庭成了
  “私”字的隐身所。他们就发动群众办起了家庭学习班，使“私”字再也无处藏身。
    在学习班里，我们特别强调干部要带头学，带头用。有个公社领导干部，每期学习班都向参加学习的各级干部亮私、斗私。八家岱有个生产队长要撂挑子，到学习班里，听了公社革命领导干部亮私、斗私后，他想：公社干部亮私、斗私不怕丑，不怕疼，我为啥有私不敢斗？第三天，他憋不住了，打开话匣子，一斗私，就斗了三个小时。晚上回去不进家，先到队里安排生产。干部带头斗私，也带动了群众。群众说：“村看村，户看户，社员看干部。干部敢亮私，社员也敢斗。”
    各种类型的学习班，都是以先进者为师，用“讲用会”的办法办。谁学了就用，能立竿见影，就叫谁给大家作辅导。讲用的过程就是大立毛泽东思想，大破资产阶级思想的过程。这样，既树立了典型，促进了人的思想革命化，又形成了一种“学了就用光荣，学了不用可耻”的新风气。
    通过带着问题大办各种类型的毛泽东思想学习班，突出一个“用”字，解决了很多实际问题。群众说：“进了学习班，学习毛主席的最新指示和
  ‘老三篇’，私心换红心，许多老大难问题就解决了。”
    毛主席教导我们说：“办学习班，是个好办法，很多问题可以在学习班得到解决。”我们从实践中深深体会到：毛主席这个指示真是无比英明，无比正确。
