Cambodian Head of State Office Issues Statement Denouncing U.S. Shameless Threats Against Cambodia

	New China News Agency, Phnom Penh, April 16 — According to a report by the Cambodian News Agency on April 15, the Office of the Head of State of Cambodia issued a statement condemning the United States for using the incident where the Cambodian naval air defense forces shot down a U.S. aircraft that violated Cambodian airspace as an excuse to make shameless threats against Cambodia.

	The statement said that on April 1, the Royal Cambodian Navy air defense forces on patrol in Cambodian territorial waters shot down a four-engine U.S. aircraft that had invaded Cambodian airspace. Two days later, according to reports by the Washington Post and Daily News, Chairman of the U.S. House Armed Services Committee Mendel Rivers commented on this incident, saying: "Now we should send our ships to the Cambodian territorial waters to sink all Cambodian warships."

	The statement pointed out that the Office of the Head of State draws the attention of international public opinion to the shamelessness of this statement by the U.S. congressman. Mendel Rivers actually threatened to destroy a country whose only "crime" was to defend its coastal islands and territorial waters. This reveals the war-mongering rhetoric of the United States, which is a challenge to all civilized countries that respect international law. The statement said: People will notice that (this U.S. congressman) also talked about how "these people" only understand the language of force. This clearly shows the contempt of American racists for the people of other countries. This despicable and arrogant attitude confirms the hypocrisy of the United States, which wears the mask of "defender of freedom" to carry out the most brutal colonialism in history.

	The statement quoted a report from the New York Post, condemning the United States for claiming that some of Cambodia's coastal islands, which have always been under Cambodian jurisdiction, belong to the South Vietnamese puppet regime.

### 柬埔寨国家元首办公厅发表声明  谴责美国对柬埔寨无耻威胁

    柬埔寨国家元首办公厅发表声明
    谴责美国对柬埔寨无耻威胁
    新华社金边十六日电　据柬埔寨新闻社十五日报道，柬埔寨国家元首办公厅发表声明，谴责美国借柬埔寨海军防空部队击中一架侵犯柬埔寨领空的美国飞机事件，对柬埔寨进行无耻的威胁。
    声明说，四月一日，在柬埔寨领海巡逻的柬埔寨王家海军防空部队，击中了侵犯我国领空的一架四引擎美国飞机。两天之后，据《华盛顿邮报》和《每日新闻》报道，美国众议院军事委员会主席门德尔·里佛斯在评论这一事件时说：“现在我们应该派遣我们的舰只到柬埔寨领海去击沉所有的柬埔寨军舰”。
    声明指出，国家元首办公厅提请国际舆论注意这名美国众议员正式发表的声明是多么无耻。门德尔·里佛斯竟然威胁要摧毁一个国家，这个国家的唯一“罪过”是保卫自己的沿海岛屿和领海。表明美国好战的言论，是对所有遵守国际法的文明国家的挑战。声明说：人们会注意到，（这个美国众议员）还讲到什么“这些人”只懂得武力的语言。这就清楚不过地说明美国种族主义者对其他国家的人民的蔑视。这种令人痛恨的嚣张态度证实了美国的虚伪，它戴着“自由的保卫者”的假面具，推行历史上前所未有的残暴的殖民主义。
    声明引述了《纽约邮报》的报道，谴责美国把一直由柬埔寨管辖的柬埔寨的一些沿海岛屿说成是属于南越傀儡集团的。
