The joint support-left team of a certain unit of the Beijing Military Region stationed in Lulong County, Hebei Province, after helping to establish the revolutionary committee in the county, closely followed the situation, actively served as good advisors for the revolutionary committee, and enthusiastically helped revolutionary cadres to carry forward the spirit of continuous revolution. They went deep into the front lines of class struggle, humbly learned from the masses, and effectively promoted the revolutionization of the leadership team, strengthened the relationship between superiors and subordinates, and consolidated the newly established revolutionary committee.

In November last year, under the brilliant guidance of Chairman Mao's latest instructions, the Lulong County Revolutionary Committee was established. How could the revolutionary cadres who participated in the three-in-one leadership team quickly achieve thought revolutionization and make new contributions to the people? This was a major issue facing them. At that time, some cadres showed signs of relaxation, thinking that their shortcomings and mistakes had been mostly corrected, and so on. Therefore, they could not actively go to the front lines of the struggle, affecting their steps towards thought revolutionization. The Party Committee of the joint support-left team timely analyzed these situations, studied Chairman Mao's teachings on "We must solve the problem of the relationship between superiors and subordinates well, and handle the relationship between cadres and the masses well. In the future, cadres should go down to the grassroots to walk around, look around, adhere to the mass line, and consult with the masses on everything, and be the students of the masses," and Comrade Lin Biao's instructions on the leadership team being the political power. They realized that they must help revolutionary cadres to break with selfishness and promote public interests, set high standards, and strictly demand of themselves. They should consciously go among the masses to temper and transform themselves, and strive to scale the heights of thought revolutionization. This is in response to Chairman Mao's great call, the need to seize the revolution and promote production, the need to achieve a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and the fundamental way to consolidate the revolutionary political power.

The Party Committee of the support-left team, based on Chairman Mao's teachings on "Grasping ideological education is the key link in uniting the whole Party to wage great political struggles," and the practical experience of helping revolutionary cadres to stand out in the previous period, first helped revolutionary cadres to raise their understanding of the significance of going deep among the masses and transforming themselves, and aroused their enthusiasm for self-revolution. They suggested that the county revolutionary committee organize revolutionary cadres to repeatedly study Chairman Mao's teachings: "The successors of the proletarian revolutionary cause are grown in the midst of the people's struggle, tempered in the stormy waves of the great revolution. They should be tested and identified in the long-term people's struggle, and selected and trained as successors." "You should put politics in command, go among the people, and be with the people. Make the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution better." Through holding study classes, heart-to-heart talks, and recalling bitterness and sweetness, they talked a lot about the benefits of going deep among the masses to transform thoughts, talked a lot about the hardships of being detached from the masses, and dug deep into the roots of being detached from the masses. They made the cadres realize that the stormy struggle of the masses is an ocean of wisdom, a great school for improving superior-subordinate relationships, and a high-temperature furnace for thought revolutionization. Only by frequently going among the masses and humbly learning from the masses can they truly carry out Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, ensure that their thoughts will never change color, and ensure that the revolutionary political power will never change color.

After raising their awareness, the county revolutionary committee immediately discussed and passed a resolution on seriously transforming the leadership style and achieving the thought revolutionization of the leadership team. Many cadres took an oath in front of Chairman Mao's portrait, vowing to always keep Chairman Mao's great teachings in mind, always be with the people, and be the students of the people. Before the study class ended, members of the county revolutionary committee such as Liu Zhangqing used their rest time to visit the representatives of the poor and lower-middle peasants attending the county's conference, and humbly sought their opinions. When the study class ended, the county revolutionary committee, except for leaving one deputy director and a few standing committee members to continue working at home, all carried the Little Red Book, packed their bags, and together with the PLA support-left personnel and revolutionary masses, formed a "three-in-one" Mao Zedong Thought propaganda team. They went deep into the front lines of the people's struggle and fought alongside the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants to study, produce, and fight.

After going deep into the front lines of the people's struggle, how could they better transform their world outlook and accelerate the construction of thought revolutionization? The support-left team always remembered Chairman Mao's teachings on "External causes are the conditions of change, and internal causes are the basis of change," and constantly helped revolutionary cadres to raise their awareness of self-revolution, always putting themselves in the position of a student, and humbly learning from the masses.

In the process of helping cadres to go deep into the front lines of the people's struggle and achieve thought revolutionization, the support-left team emphasized helping cadres to solve three relationships: the relationship between internal and external causes, the relationship between being a student and a teacher, and the relationship between being the object of revolution and the driving force of revolution. They made revolutionary cadres clearly understand that going deep among the masses to transform their world outlook requires relying on the help of the masses, relying on their own subjective efforts, and mainly relying on subjective efforts; they should be both students and teachers, first be the students of the masses, and in learning from the masses, help the masses; they should be both the driving force of revolution and the object of revolution. Only by being a good object of revolution can they be a good driving force of revolution. Because the cadres had the correct attitude towards the three relationships, their posture of learning from the masses was higher. They strove to be loyal to Chairman Mao with a "loyal" heart, to study Chairman Mao's works with a "use" spirit, to bring their "selfishness" wherever they went, and to continuously achieve new results in thought revolutionization.

What should be the most fundamental thing to grasp in mobilizing cadres to carry out thought revolutionization in the stormy struggle of the masses? The support-left personnel always put helping revolutionary cadres to deepen their proletarian feelings of boundless love for Chairman Mao and unlimited loyalty to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line in a higher position. In the struggle to go deep among the masses, the support-left personnel actively led revolutionary cadres to participate in community, brigade, and household Mao Zedong Thought study classes, and together with poor and lower-middle peasants, recall bitterness and sweetness, fight against selfishness and revise and criticize revisionism, and participate in revolutionary great criticism. They invited advanced activists of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works in the countryside to introduce advanced experiences. The boundless loyalty of the broad revolutionary masses to Chairman Mao and the sublime morality of their boundless love for Mao Zedong Thought greatly educated and inspired them, further arousing their self-awareness of breaking with selfishness and promoting public interests in their souls.

    积极为革命委员会充当好参谋  大力促进领导班子实现革命化
    北京部队某部驻卢龙县联合支左小组为巩固新生的革委会贡献力量
    本报讯　北京部队某部驻河北省卢龙县联合支左小组，在帮助这个县建立革命委员会以后，紧跟形势，积极为革命委员会当好参谋，满腔热情地帮助革命干部发扬不断革命精神，深入阶级斗争第一线，虚心地向群众学习，有力地促进了领导班子思想革命化，密切了上下级关系，巩固了新生的革命委员会。
    去年十一月，在毛主席最新指示的光辉照耀下，卢龙县革命委员会建立起来了。参加三结合领导班子的革命干部怎样加速实现思想革命化，为人民作出新贡献？这是面临的一个重大问题。当时，有的干部流露出松劲情绪，认为自己的缺点错误改得差不多了，等等。因此，不能主动深入斗争第一线，影响到他们思想革命化的步伐。联合支左小组党委及时分析了这些情况，学习了毛主席关于“要很好地解决上下级关系问题，搞好干部和群众的关系。以后干部要分别到下面去走一走，看一看，要坚持群众路线，遇事多和群众商量，做群众的小学生”的教导，和林副主席关于领导班子就是政权的指示，认识到必须帮助革命干部破私立公，高标准，严要求，自觉地到群众中去锻炼和改造自己，努力攀登思想革命化的高峰。这是响应毛主席的伟大号召，抓革命促生产的需要，是夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的需要，是巩固革命政权的根本途径。
    支左小组党委根据毛主席关于“掌握思想教育，是团结全党进行伟大政治斗争的中心环节”的教导，和前一段帮助革命干部站出来的切身体会，首先帮助革命干部提高对深入群众、改造自己的意义的认识，激发了自我革命的积极性。他们建议县革命委员会组织革命干部反复学习毛主席的教导：“无产阶级革命事业的接班人，是在群众斗争中产生的，是在革命大风大浪的锻炼中成长的。应当在长期的群众斗争中，考察和识别干部，挑选和培养接班人。”“你们要政治挂帅，到群众里面去，和群众在一起，把无产阶级文化大革命搞得更好。”通过办学习班、谈心互助、忆苦思甜等活动，大谈深入群众有利于改造思想的好处，大谈脱离群众的苦头，大挖脱离群众的根子，使干部认识到，群众斗争的大风雨是智慧的海洋，搞好上下级关系的大学校，思想革命化的高温熔炉。只有经常到群众里面去，虚心拜群众为师，才能真正执行毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，保证自己的思想永不变色，保证革命政权永不变色。
    认识提高后，县革命委员会立即讨论通过了关于认真转变领导作风和实现领导班子思想革命化的决议。许多干部在毛主席像前宣了誓，决心牢记伟大领袖毛主席的英明教导，永远和群众心连心，当群众的小学生。学习班还没结束，县革委会成员刘章清等同志就利用休息时间，到正在参加县里召开的贫下中农代表会议代表的住地，热情探望贫下中农代表，虚心征求他们的意见。学习班结束时，县革命委员会除留一名副主任和少数几名常委在家坚持工作外，其余全部带上宝书，背起背包，和解放军支左人员、革命群众一起，组成了“三结合”毛泽东思想宣传队，深入群众斗争第一线，和广大贫下中农一道学习、生产和战斗。
    深入群众斗争第一线以后，怎样才能更好地改造世界观，加速思想革命化建设？支左小组牢记毛主席关于“外因是变化的条件，内因是变化的根据”的教导，不断帮助革命干部提高自我革命的自觉性，始终把自己摆在小学生的位置，虚心向群众学习。
    支左小组在帮助干部深入群众斗争第一线、实现思想革命化的过程中，十分强调帮助干部解决好三个关系：内因和外因的关系，当学生和当先生的关系，当革命对象和当革命动力的关系。使革命干部明确认识到，深入群众改造世界观，既要依靠群众的帮助，又要依靠自己的主观努力，主要依靠主观努力；既要当学生，又要当先生，要先当群众的学生，在向群众学习中帮助群众；既要当革命动力，又要当革命对象，只有当好革命对象，才能当好革命动力。由于干部摆对了三个关系，树立了正确的态度，向群众学习的姿态更高了。他们努力做到对毛主席心怀一个“忠”字，学习毛主席著作狠抓一个“用”字，走到哪里，把自己的“私”字亮到哪里，思想革命化不断取得新成果。
    发动干部到群众斗争的大风雨中搞思想革命化最根本的应抓什么？支左人员始终把帮助革命干部加深对毛主席无比热爱的无产阶级感情，无限忠于毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，放在高于一切的位置。在深入群众的斗争中，支左人员积极带动革命干部参加社办、队办和户办的毛泽东思想学习班，和贫下中农一起忆苦思甜，一起斗私批修，一起参加革命的大批判。他们请农村活学活用毛主席著作积极分子介绍先进经验。广大革命群众对毛主席无比忠诚，对毛泽东思想无比热爱的高尚品德，大大教育和鼓舞了他们，进一步激发了他们在灵魂深处破私立公的自觉性。
