The invincible victory of Mao Zedong Thought and the fruits of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution have been fully displayed at the 1968 Spring Session of the China Export Commodities Fair, which opened in Guangzhou today. The fair, with a new look and an unprecedentedly rich array of industrial and agricultural products, has met with friends from the trade circles of five continents, overseas Chinese, and compatriots from Hong Kong and Macao. It vividly demonstrates the great achievements of the Chinese people in holding high the invincible red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, winning great victories in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and making tremendous strides in socialist construction. It also showcases the unparalleled superiority of the socialist economic system to the people of the world.

The China Export Commodities Fair Building, standing in the heart of Guangzhou at Haizhu Square, is today adorned with flying red flags. Red balloons hang in the sky above the square, bearing huge banners that read: "Long live the great leader, teacher, commander, and helmsman Chairman Mao!" "Long live the invincible Mao Zedong Thought!" "Long live the complete victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution!" A giant portrait of Chairman Mao, the great leader, stands at the main entrance of the fair building. Nearby, the newly completed 27-story Guangzhou Hotel, which welcomes guests, is also decorated anew. The wide new walls bear the inscription by Vice Chairman Lin Biao: "A ship on the vast ocean needs a helmsman, and a revolution needs Mao Zedong Thought."

This morning, the opening ceremony of the fair was held on the square in front of the fair building. The number of foreign guests and trade representatives attending this session of the fair has been unprecedentedly high, with more attendees at the opening ceremony than in any previous session. Vice Minister of Foreign Trade Jia Shi delivered a speech at the opening ceremony. He, on behalf of the Ministry of Foreign Trade of the People's Republic of China and the China Export Commodities Fair, extended a warm welcome to friends from the trade circles of dozens of countries and regions on five continents, overseas Chinese, and compatriots from Hong Kong and Macao.

Jia Shi spoke about the current domestic and international situation, which is excellent and improving. He pointed out that the capitalist world economy, led by the United States, is in chaos, with financial crises, soaring prices, currency devaluation, and factory closures. All these indicate that the decaying and declining imperialist economy is at its end, and the imperialist bloc led by U.S. imperialism is disintegrating. At the same time, the days of the revisionist clique centered around the Soviet revisionists are also numbered. In contrast, the situation in our country is excellent and getting better. A nationwide movement to study Chairman Mao's works and implement his latest instructions is flourishing. Our agricultural production has achieved an unprecedented bumper harvest, industrial production is booming, the market is thriving, prices are stable, and the excellent situation in industry and agriculture provides a solid material foundation for the development and expansion of our foreign trade. All these once again vividly prove the correct judgment of our great leader Chairman Mao: "The enemy is rotting away day by day, and we are improving day by day."

Our great teacher Chairman Mao teaches us: "Revolution is the liberation of productive forces, and revolution is the promotion of the development of productive forces." Through the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, which has shaken the world over the past two years, the enthusiasm of the Chinese people has been greatly aroused. The revolutionary masses on the industrial and agricultural fronts have firmly implemented the great line proposed by Chairman Mao, "Grasp revolution, promote production," achieving new great successes in socialist construction. The export commodities provided by various places across the country for this session of the fair are unprecedentedly rich. Among the nearly 30,000 products on display, many high-quality, high-level new products were designed and manufactured during the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. In the machinery and instrument exhibition hall, the newly exhibited precision machine tools are of international advanced level, and many mechanical equipment suitable for medium and small-sized enterprises, as well as equipment for the food and textile industries, have been highly praised by the guests. Various instruments and electrical equipment have increased by more than 70 new items compared to the autumn session last year. The exhibition area for electronic instruments has expanded by one-third compared to the autumn session last year. This session also exhibits many new products from the chemical, metallurgical, and automotive industries. The unprecedentedly rich industrial products reflect the new achievements of the revolutionary and production victories won by the broad revolutionary cadres on the industrial front who firmly implement Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. In terms of agricultural products, due to the high morale and enthusiasm of the revolutionary masses in the vast rural areas of our country, agricultural production has achieved a bumper harvest for six consecutive years, providing an exceptionally abundant supply of grain and oil food for this session of the fair. The major commodities such as rice, wheat, beans, and oil crops for export at this session have increased from more than 140 varieties in the autumn session last year to more than 190 varieties.

The invincible Mao Zedong Thought inspires the revolutionary struggles of the people of the world. The revolutionary people of various countries in the world regard the great Mao Zedong Thought as the strongest and sharpest ideological weapon against imperialism, revisionism, and the reactionary cliques of various countries. Chairman Mao's books have become the most beloved revolutionary classics of the revolutionary people of the world. At present, there are 148 countries and regions in the world that have ordered Chairman Mao's works from China. This session of the fair will supply more various editions of Chairman Mao's works and the "Quotations from Chairman Mao" to meet the urgent needs of the revolutionary people of the world.

The fair also held a grand reception tonight. More than 4,000 guests and representatives of various trade delegations attended the reception. Chen Yu, the chairman of the China Export Commodities Fair, said in his speech at the reception that the fair will continue to hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, further implement the foreign trade policy of "equality and mutual benefit, mutual exchange of needs," and further develop normal trade exchanges between our country and various countries and regions in the world, making this session of the fair even better. The reception was filled with a warm and friendly atmosphere from beginning to end, with guests and hosts repeatedly shouting: "Long live Chairman Mao!" "Long live the great unity of the people of the world!"

Foreign friends from five continents and compatriots from Hong Kong and Macao eagerly enter the exhibition hall.

    一九六八年春季我国出口商品交易会在广州隆重开幕
    工农业生产的大好形势为发展和扩大我国对外贸易提供了雄厚的物质基础。交易会上展出的近三万种产品中，有许多高质量、高水平的新产品是在无产阶级文化大革命中设计制造成功的

    新华社广州十五日电　一九六八年春季中国出口商品交易会，今天在广州隆重开幕。交易会以崭新的面貌和空前丰富的工农业展品同来自五大洲的各国贸易界朋友、海外华侨和港澳同胞见面，充分显示了我国人民高举战无不胜的毛泽东思想伟大红旗取得了无产阶级文化大革命的伟大成果和社会主义建设的巨大成就，向全世界人民展示了社会主义经济制度的无比优越性。
    屹立在广州市中心海珠广场的中国出口商品交易会大厦，今天红旗飘扬，广场上空的红色气球悬挂着巨幅标语：“伟大的导师、伟大的领袖、伟大的统帅、伟大的舵手毛主席万岁！”“伟大的战无不胜的毛泽东思想万岁！”“无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利万岁！”在交易会大厦正门矗立着伟大领袖毛主席的巨幅画像。交易会大厦邻近新落成的接待来宾的一座二十七层大厦——广州宾馆，今天也装饰一新，宽阔的新墙上，写着林彪副主席的题词：“大海航行靠舵手，干革命靠毛泽东思想。”
    上午，在交易会大厦的广场上举行了交易会的开幕仪式。应邀前来参加这一届交易会的各国来宾和贸易界人士空前踊跃，参加开幕式的来宾比历届开幕时到达的人数都多。对外贸易部副部长贾石在开幕式上讲了话。他代表中华人民共和国对外贸易部和中国出口商品交易会，向来自世界五大洲的几十个国家和地区的贸易界朋友、海外侨胞和港澳同胞表示热烈欢迎。
    贾石谈到了当前国内外一片大好形势。他指出，以美国为首的资本主义世界经济一片混乱，金融危机，物价高涨，货币贬值，工厂倒闭。所有这些表明，腐朽没落的帝国主义经济已经山穷水尽，日暮途穷，以美帝国主义为首的帝国主义集团正在分崩离析。与此同时，以苏修为中心的修正主义集团的日子也越来越不好过。同帝国主义国家相反，我国国内的形势一片大好，而且越来越好。一个规模空前的、更加深入的活学活用毛主席著作、大办毛泽东思想学习班，全面落实毛主席最新指示的群众运动，正在全国各地蓬蓬勃勃发展。我国的农业生产获得空前大丰收，工业生产蒸蒸日上，市场繁荣，物价稳定，工农业生产的大好形势，为发展和扩大我国对外贸易提供了雄厚的物质基础。所有这些，再一次雄辩地证明了我们伟大领袖毛主席的英明论断：“敌人一天天烂下去，我们一天天好起来”。
    我们的伟大导师毛主席教导我们说：“革命就是解放生产力，革命就是促进生产力的发展。”经过近两年来的震撼世界的我国无产阶级文化大革命，极大地激发了我国人民的积极性。我国工农业生产战线上的广大革命群众，坚决贯彻伟大领袖毛主席提出的“抓革命，促生产”的伟大方针，使我国社会主义建设获得新的伟大成就。全国各地为这一届交易会提供的出口商品空前丰富。在交易会展出的近三万种产品中，有许多高质量、高水平的新产品，是在无产阶级文化大革命中设计制造成功的。在机械、仪器陈列大厅里，新展出的精密机床具有国际先进水平，许多适用于中小型企业的机械设备以及食品、纺织工业的设备得到了来宾们的高度评价。各种仪器和电工设备，比去年秋季交易会又增加了七十多种新展品。其中电子仪器的展出面积，比去年秋季交易会扩大三分之一。这届交易会还展出许多化学工业、冶金工业和汽车工业的新产品。空前丰富的工业产品，反映了我国工业战线上广大革命职工，坚决执行毛主席的无产阶级革命路线取得革命和生产双胜利的新成就。在农产品方面，由于我国广大农村革命群众意气风发，干劲冲天，取得了农业连续六年的丰收，为这一届交易会提供的粮油食品格外丰盛。这一届交易会提供出口的大米、小麦、豆类、油料作物等大宗商品，从去年秋季交易会的一百四十多个品种增加到一百九十多个品种。
    战无不胜的毛泽东思想鼓舞着全世界革命人民的革命斗争。世界各国革命人民把伟大的毛泽东思想作为反帝、反修和反对各国反动派的最强大最锐利的思想武器。毛主席的书，已经成为世界革命人民最爱读的革命宝书。目前，世界上有一百四十八个国家和地区从中国订购毛主席著作。这一届交易会将有更多的各种文版的毛主席著作和《毛主席语录》供应世界各国革命人民的迫切需要。
    交易会在今晚还举行了盛大的招待会。出席招待会的来宾和各交易团代表共四千多人。中国出口商品交易会主任委员陈郁在招待会上讲话说，交易会将更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，继续贯彻“平等互利，互通有无”的对外贸易政策，进一步发展我国同世界各国和各地区的正常贸易往来，把这届交易会办得更好。招待会自始至终洋溢着热烈友好的气氛，宾主一遍又一遍欢呼：“毛主席万岁！”“全世界人民大团结万岁！”（附图片）
