Vietnamese people on the front lines of the anti-American struggle have enthusiastically hailed Mao Zedong's statement supporting the struggle of American blacks against violence. They say that Chairman Mao's statement is not only a great encouragement and support for the struggle of American blacks against violence and the struggle of oppressed peoples worldwide for liberation, but also a great encouragement and support for the Vietnamese people's struggle against American imperialism for national salvation.

A worker from the Hanoi Thang Long cigarette factory, who participated in the anti-French war, and a cadre from the South, Nguyen Thi Thanh Chu, told a Xinhua News Agency correspondent: "Chairman Mao's statement supporting the struggle of American blacks against violence not only has a profound impact on the struggle of American blacks but is also a great encouragement and support for our Vietnamese people's struggle against American imperialism for national salvation. Because we and American blacks are fighting against a common enemy—American imperialism. We Vietnamese people have no illusions about the so-called peace of American imperialism. We will resolutely follow the teachings of Uncle Ho to fight, and the 31 million Vietnamese people will all become heroes who annihilate Americans."

Self-defense forces member Nguyen Trung Tu said: "We Vietnamese workers are very excited after reading Chairman Mao's statement. This statement expresses Chairman Mao and the Communist Party of China's greatest concern and support for the struggle of American blacks. The Chinese people have always stood on the side of the oppressed peoples and nations of the world. We Vietnamese people are suffering from the aggression and oppression of American imperialism, so Chairman Mao's statement is also a great encouragement and support for our struggle against American imperialism for national salvation."

The deputy director of the Vietnam-China Friendship Agricultural Cooperative and a militia instructor said: "We warmly welcome and firmly support Chairman Mao's statement supporting the struggle of American blacks against violence. Chairman Mao is most concerned about and supports the struggle of the oppressed peoples and nations of the world. Chairman Mao's statement is also a great encouragement to us. In response to Chairman Mao's statement, we will strengthen our struggle, work hard in production, and be determined to thoroughly defeat American imperialism."

A surgeon and deputy director of a certain hospital, Nguyen Anh Quang, said: "All the staff of our hospital warmly welcome Chairman Mao's statement supporting the struggle of American blacks against violence. The struggle of the Vietnamese people and the struggle of American blacks have a common goal—to oppose American imperialism. These two struggles are closely linked. The struggle of American blacks has contributed to supporting the struggle of the Vietnamese people, and we Vietnamese people firmly support the struggle of American blacks."

A model teacher from Trung Dung Middle School, Vu Dinh Nhu, said: "Chairman Mao's statement has made me and all the teachers and students very excited. We warmly welcome Chairman Mao's statement."
