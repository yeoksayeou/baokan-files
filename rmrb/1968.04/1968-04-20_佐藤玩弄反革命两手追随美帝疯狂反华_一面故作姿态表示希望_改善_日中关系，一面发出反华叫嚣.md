Recently, the reactionary Japanese government, led by Prime Minister Sato Eisaku, has been playing a two-faced game in its relations with China. On one hand, he pretends to hope for an improvement in Sino-Japanese relations, while on the other, he viciously attacks China. He actively participates in the U.S. empire's plot to create "two Chinas" and stubbornly follows the U.S. empire's reactionary policy of hostility towards China.

This year, the wave of anti-American and pro-China justice struggles among the broad masses of the Japanese people has been surging higher and higher. They severely condemn the reactionary foreign policy of the Sato government. The Japan-China Friendship Association (Genuine) Headquarters and the Japan Association for the Promotion of International Trade recently strongly demanded that the Sato government change its hostile policy towards China and called for Sato to step down. The Japanese Socialist Party recently pointed out that Sato has committed a crime by following America's policy of aggression and war, and that Sato should step down. Sato's situation has become increasingly desperate.

In this situation, Sato, in order to deceive the broad masses of the Japanese people, shamelessly resorts to his usual two-faced revolutionary tactics. Recently, while hypocritically expressing his hope for an improvement in Sino-Japanese relations, he blatantly shouted that there is no need to change the policy of following the U.S. empire in its hostility towards China. He insisted on continuing the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" and loudly proclaimed that the Chiang Kai-shek bandits, who have long been spat upon by the Chinese people and are squatting in Taiwan, are also "China," openly opposing the Chinese people. Sato's anti-China rhetoric fully exposes the reactionary face of the Sato government, which stubbornly adheres to the policy of being pro-American, pro-Soviet, and anti-China.

Sato's two-faced revolutionary tactics are repeatedly used. In March of this year, after the signing of the joint communiqué of the Sino-Japanese trade liaison offices, it was warmly welcomed by the Japanese people and the Japanese business community. Sato, at that time, cunningly declared, "We must make serious efforts to expand Sino-Japanese trade," while at the same time, he openly said that improving Sino-Japanese relations during his cabinet's term "may not be possible." Sato also repeatedly shouted that he would continue to implement the policy of "separating politics from economics" in Sino-Japanese relations, stubbornly following the U.S. empire in its hostility towards China, while at the same time trying to reap economic benefits.

Sato, who follows the U.S. empire in its hostility towards China, in the latter half of last year, visited eleven countries and regions in the Asia-Pacific region to engage in counter-revolutionary collusion, actively forming an anti-China encirclement circle with the U.S. empire as its backer and Japan as its center. He openly sneaked into the Chinese territory of Taiwan, which is occupied by the Chiang bandits, to engage in conspiracy activities, and "invited" the head of the Chiang bandits, Chiang Ching-kuo, who has long been spat upon by the Chinese people, to "visit" Japan. At the same time, he actively promoted the plot of "two Chinas" within the United Nations. After visiting the United States last year, according to the instructions of his American masters, he loudly proclaimed the "nuclear threat" of China and barked madly about "blocking" China's influence. Under the protection of U.S. imperialism, the Sato government is hurriedly reviving militarism and actively pursuing nuclear armament, directing its spearhead at socialist China and the peoples of various Asian countries. All these facts show that Sato is a loyal henchman of U.S. imperialism in its opposition to the Chinese people and the peoples of Asia.

Great Leader Chairman Mao pointed out: "If the U.S. monopoly capitalist group insists on pursuing its policy of aggression and war, it will inevitably be hanged by the people of the whole world one day. Other American accomplices will also meet the same fate." The reactionary Sato government of Japan stubbornly follows the U.S. empire's policy of aggression and war, firmly adhering to its stance of being hostile to the Chinese people and the peoples of various Asian countries, and will not have a good ending.

    佐藤玩弄反革命两手追随美帝疯狂反华
    一面故作姿态表示希望“改善”日中关系，一面发出反华叫嚣
    据新华社十九日讯东京消息：最近以来，日本反动政府首相佐藤荣作在对华关系上大肆玩弄反革命两手，一方面他故作姿态地表示希望“改善”日中关系，另一方面却不断恶毒地发出反华叫嚣，积极参与美帝制造“两个中国”的阴谋，死心塌地坚持追随美帝敌视中国的反动政策。
    今年以来，广大日本人民反美爱国正义斗争的怒潮一浪高过一浪，他们严厉谴责佐藤政府的反动对外政策。日中友好协会（正统）总部和日本国际贸易促进协会最近强烈要求佐藤政府改变敌视中国的政策，并且要求佐藤下台。日本社会党最近也指出，佐藤追随美国的侵略政策和战争政策犯了罪，佐藤应该下台。佐藤荣作的处境越来越狼狈。
    在这种情况下，佐藤为了欺骗广大日本人民，无耻地施展出他惯用的反革命两面手法。最近他在假惺惺地表示“希望日中关系有所改善”的同时，赤裸裸地叫嚷“没有必要改变”追随美帝敌视中国的政策，要继续坚持日美“安全条约”，并且大肆叫嚷早已被中国人民唾弃的窃踞在台湾的蒋介石匪帮也“同样是中国”，露骨地与中国人民为敌。佐藤的这些敌视中国的叫嚣，充分暴露了佐藤反动政府顽固地坚持亲美联苏反华的反动嘴脸。
    佐藤的这种反革命两面手法是反复使用的。今年三月，中日双方备忘录贸易办事处会谈公报签订后，受到了日本人民和日本贸易界的热烈欢迎。佐藤当时一方面狡猾地宣称，“要认真地努力扩大日中贸易”，另一方面又毫不掩饰地说，改善日中关系在他的内阁期间“也许是不可能实现的”。佐藤还一再叫嚷要在日中关系上继续执行“政治、经济分离”的政策，一方面顽固地追随美帝敌视中国，另方面又企图在经济上捞取实惠。
    追随美帝敌视中国的佐藤荣作，在去年下半年曾到亚洲太平洋地区的十一个国家和地区进行反革命串连，积极拼凑以美帝为后台、以日本为中心的反华包围圈。他公然窜入被蒋匪帮盘踞的中国领土台湾进行阴谋活动，并“邀请”早已被中国人民所唾弃的蒋匪帮头目蒋经国“访问”日本，同时在联合国内大搞“两个中国”的阴谋。佐藤在去年访问美国后，按照美国主子的意旨，大肆叫嚷中国的“核威胁”，并狂吠要“挡住”中国的影响。佐藤政府在美帝国主义的卵翼下正加紧全面复活军国主义，积极进行核武装，把矛头指向社会主义中国和亚洲各国人民。所有这些事实表明，佐藤是美帝国主义反对中国人民和亚洲人民的忠实走卒。
    伟大领袖毛主席指出：“美国垄断资本集团如果坚持推行它的侵略政策和战争政策，势必有一天要被全世界人民处以绞刑。其他美国帮凶也将是这样。”日本佐藤反动政府死心塌地追随美帝的侵略政策和战争政策，顽固地坚持与中国人民和亚洲各国人民为敌，绝不会有好下场。
