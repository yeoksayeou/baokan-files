The Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team of a certain unit of the Tianjin garrison of the People's Liberation Army has helped the members of the Revolutionary Committee of the Xiangdong Sanitary Materials Factory to establish a good attitude and style of closely connecting with the masses, making the Revolutionary Committee take root among the masses. The masses reflect: "Such a Revolutionary Committee, we can trust!"

The Revolutionary Committee of the Xiangdong Sanitary Materials Factory was established in September last year. Initially, the relationship between the cadres and the masses was good, but over time, some leading members' thoughts changed. Out of the seven committee members, originally only one was full-time, but later, the other members also rarely participated in labor, and the relationship between the cadres and the masses was no longer as close as before.

The Propaganda Team believed that whether the leading cadre of the Revolutionary Committee can closely connect with the masses and whether they can always maintain the character of ordinary laborers is a major issue concerning whether the newly born Revolutionary Committee can be consolidated. It is also a major issue concerning whether the Revolutionary Committee can lead the broad masses to follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, fully implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions, and achieve a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. They organized the members of the Revolutionary Committee to study Chairman Mao's teachings on "We communists are not to be officials, but to make revolution" and "Never separate from the masses." Some old cadres also painfully recalled their past experiences of separating from labor and the masses, which led to mistakes. Many committee members, through self-criticism, examined their previous tendencies to separate from the masses. They said, "Chairman Mao teaches us: 'To be both an official and a commoner.' Our positions have changed, but the character of ordinary laborers cannot change. Separating from the masses and labor is like a fish leaving water, or a seed leaving soil. The Revolutionary Committee would have no foundation, and we would change color and become revisionists. We are determined to unite with the masses, go deep into the masses, and take root among the masses."

Chairman Mao teaches us: "The masses are the real heroes, while we ourselves are often childish and ridiculous, not understanding this point, we cannot gain even the most basic knowledge." The Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team always pays attention to helping the Revolutionary Committee establish a correct attitude towards the masses. The soldiers of the Propaganda Team believe that to make the members of the Revolutionary Committee truly take root among the masses, they must help them firmly establish the spirit of looking downwards and being willing to be students of the masses. Otherwise, the root cannot be truly planted, it cannot be deep, and it cannot be firm. In October last year, the factory wanted to change the working hours from a "three-shift system" to a "two-shift system." Some leading members of the Revolutionary Committee thought they were familiar with the situation and that the masses would not have any new opinions, so they did not wait to collect the masses' opinions but instead published the method decided by a few members of the Revolutionary Committee. As a result, many masses were very dissatisfied. After discovering this problem, the Propaganda Team organized the members of the Revolutionary Committee to study Chairman Mao's works. Chairman Mao said: "Without a heart full of enthusiasm, without the determination to look downwards, without the desire for knowledge, without the spirit of putting down one's airs and being willing to be a student, one will definitely not be able to do it and definitely will not be able to do it well." Through study, the members of the Revolutionary Committee realized: only believing in oneself and not believing in the masses, even if one spends the whole day among the masses, one cannot truly unite with the masses and take root among them.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "In all practical work of our Party, correct leadership must come from the masses and go to the masses." The soldiers of the Propaganda Team often teach the members of the Revolutionary Committee the method of face-to-face leadership used in the army, helping the leading cadres to strengthen their leadership over the masses in the process of taking root among the masses.

Under the help of the Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team stationed in the factory, the Revolutionary Committee of the Xiangdong Sanitary Materials Factory has carried forward the good style of closely connecting with the masses. All seven committee members and six administrative cadres of the entire factory participate in labor in the workshops, and none of them have left production. They often talk with the masses and engage in self-criticism and criticism of revisionism among the masses where there are the most opinions. When encountering major issues, they consciously hand them over to the masses for discussion and resolution, making all the cadres and masses of the entire factory think and work together, and step in unison to follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment. The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution movement in the entire factory is carried out vigorously and solidly, and everywhere presents a lively revolutionary scene.

    革委会要扎根在群众之中
    天津驻军某部毛泽东思想宣传队帮助向东卫生材料厂革命委员会成员，树立密切联系群众的好思想好作风
    据新华社天津电　人民解放军天津驻军某部毛泽东思想宣传队，帮助天津向东卫生材料厂革命委员会成员，树立密切联系群众的好思想、好作风，使革命委员会扎根在群众之中。群众反映：“这样的革命委员会，我们信得过！”
    向东卫生材料厂革命委员会是去年九月份成立的。开始，干群关系比较好，可是时间长了，有的领导成员思想上发生了变化。革委会七个委员中，原来只有一个人脱产，后来其他成员也很少参加劳动，干群关系不象过去那样亲热了。
    宣传队认为，革命委员会领导班子能不能密切联系群众，能不能永远保持普通劳动者的本色，是关系到新诞生的革命委员会能不能巩固的大问题，是关系到革委会能不能带领广大群众紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，全面落实毛主席的最新指示，夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的重大问题。他们组织革命委员会成员学习毛主席关于“我们共产党人不是要做官，而是要革命”和“一刻也不脱离群众”的教导，有的老干部还沉痛地回顾了自己过去脱离劳动，脱离群众以致犯错误的教训。许多委员通过自我批评，检查了前一段脱离群众的作风。他们说，毛主席教导我们：“既当‘官’，又当老百姓。”我们的职务变了，但是普通劳动者的本色不能变。离开了群众，脱离了劳动，就是鱼儿离开了水，种籽离开了土壤，革委会就没有基础，我们就要变色变修。大家决心和群众打成一片，深入到群众中去，在群众中间扎根。
    毛主席教导我们：“群众是真正的英雄，而我们自己则往往是幼稚可笑的，不了解这一点，就不能得到起码的知识。”毛泽东思想宣传队始终注意帮助革命委员会树立正确对待群众的态度。宣传队的指战员们认为，要使革命委员会成员真正扎根于群众之中，必须帮助他们牢固树立眼睛向下，甘当群众小学生的精神。否则，这个根就不能真正扎下去，就扎不深，扎不牢。去年十月份，厂里要把劳动时间由“三班制”改为“两班制”。革委会的一些领导成员认为自己情况熟悉，群众不会提出什么新意见，没有等把群众的意见搜集起来，就把革委会成员几个人商量决定的办法公布了出去。结果，许多群众很不满意。宣传队发现这个问题后，便组织革委会成员学习毛主席著作。毛主席说：“没有满腔的热忱，没有眼睛向下的决心，没有求知的渴望，没有放下臭架子、甘当小学生的精神，是一定不能做，也一定做不好的。”通过学习，革命委员会成员认识到：只相信自己，不相信群众，即使一天到晚在群众中间，也不能真正和群众打成一片，扎根到群众中去。
    毛主席教导我们：“在我党的一切实际工作中，凡属正确的领导，必须是从群众中来，到群众中去。”宣传队的指战员经常向革命委员会成员传授部队中实行面对面领导的方法，帮助领导干部在扎根群众的过程中，大力加强对群众的领导。
    在驻厂毛泽东思想宣传队的帮助下，向东卫生材料厂革命委员会发扬了密切联系群众的好作风，全厂七个委员和六个业务干部，全部到车间参加劳动，没有一个脱离生产。他们经常找群众谈心，在意见最多的群众中间斗私批修。遇到重大问题，都自觉地交给群众讨论解决，使全厂干部、群众心往一处想，劲往一处使，步调一致地紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，全厂的无产阶级文化大革命运动开展得轰轰烈烈，扎扎实实，到处呈现一片热气腾腾的革命景象。
