Edition: 6

The great teacher of the proletariat, Chairman Mao, issued his first statement in support of the American black people's struggle on August 8, 1963. This statement powerfully inspired the American black people's fight for survival and liberation. In the more than four years since then, the struggle of American blacks has made tremendous strides, advancing to the path of using revolutionary violence to oppose counter-revolutionary violence. Their struggle has spread like wildfire, growing more intense and burning the imperialists to the point of desperation. There is no doubt that the issuance of Chairman Mao's second statement in support of the American black people's struggle will further promote the awakening of American blacks, making their just struggle for liberation surge forward with even greater momentum.

The American blacks' adoption of violent struggle marks their accelerating awakening; through struggle, they have further recognized their own strength, thereby enhancing their fighting spirit and firming their resolve to follow this path. For this reason, over the past four years, the American blacks' violent self-defense struggles have risen higher and higher; the new wave of anti-violence struggles they have recently launched is even more rapid and powerful than in previous years. Their heroic struggles have dealt a heavy blow to American imperialism and won the enthusiastic praise and strong support of revolutionary people around the world.

The Tide of Black Anti-Violence Struggles Is Irresistible

Over the past four years, the tide of American black anti-violence struggles has rolled forward, unstoppable.

In July 1964, black residents of New York's Harlem area rose up to use violence against the fascist brutality of the police, sounding the call for large-scale anti-violence struggles in the cities. Since then, American blacks have launched one wave of anti-violence struggles after another, each more rapid and intense than the last; the number of cities affected has grown from a few to dozens, and last summer, nearly a hundred cities were involved. In the struggles, black residents, filled with intense anger against racial oppression and exploitation, set countless fires and destroyed many pawnshops and stores owned by white exploiters, paralyzing some important industrial centers; black snipers also struck from all directions, fiercely attacking the fascist military and police. All of this was a direct challenge to the ruling class's "laws" and "order," dealing a fierce blow to the reactionary rule of American monopoly capital at home.

Just in the past four years, as anti-violence struggles have flourished, American blacks have launched a new wave of anti-violence struggles this April, earlier than in previous years. This wave has been unprecedented in its rapidity and intensity, like a raging storm, sweeping through more than 120 cities, large and small, in just one week, dealing an unprecedented heavy blow to the American ruling class, making the imperialists, who have suffered repeated defeats in the Vietnam War and are facing a serious financial crisis at home, even more besieged and desperate.

The Black Masses Are Awakening at an Unprecedented Rate

The continuous rise of black anti-violence struggles marks the accelerating political awakening of the broad masses of American blacks.

In 1964 in Harlem, in 1965 in Watts, in 1966 in Chicago, in 1967 in Newark and Detroit, and recently in Washington, Baltimore, and Kansas City... one large-scale anti-violence struggle after another has tempered the broad masses of blacks; they have become increasingly aware of their own great strength, and their fighting spirit has grown ever stronger.

The American ruling class's bloody suppression of blacks has, from the opposite side, educated the broad masses of blacks, making more and more blacks understand the absolute necessity of using revolutionary violence to counter counter-revolutionary violence. Since 1965, when blacks in Watts took up guns to fight against reactionary military and police, in anti-violence struggles across the country, more and more black snipers have appeared. Brave black snipers have fired from rooftops, windows, and speeding cars at the fascist military and police who have been rampaging against blacks, striking fear into the hearts of these thugs, leaving them nowhere to hide. In many cities, blacks have opened gun stores or armories and seized guns to arm themselves during anti-violence struggles.

It is particularly worth mentioning that a new generation of blacks has rapidly grown up in the anti-violence struggles, tempered by blood and fire. They are young people under the age of twenty-five, born in the slums of big-city black areas, struggling since childhood between hunger and death, living a life of darkness. Therefore, they have an extremely intense hatred for the ruling class's enslavement and exploitation. They fear nothing in the struggle, are brave and tenacious, and neither prisons, bullets, nor poison gas can intimidate them. Some of the advanced elements among them have already begun to realize that unless the imperialist system is completely destroyed, blacks will never truly be liberated. These people are playing an increasingly prominent role in the black struggle.

The American Ruling Class Is Terrified

Facing the raging development of black anti-violence struggles, the American ruling class can no longer pretend to be concerned with "freedom" and "democracy," increasingly revealing its fascist, ugly face.

Over the past four years, the American ruling class has used batons, whips, tear gas, bayonets, machine guns, and even armored cars, tanks, and helicopters to suppress black anti-violence struggles. In the recent black anti-violence struggles, the terrified Johnson administration has even deployed more than 60,000 regular troops and national guardsmen, working with armed police across the country to brutally suppress black masses, with another 20,000 regular troops on standby, ready to be deployed at any moment to suppress. The American ruling class has deployed such a large number of troops to suppress the revolutionary struggles of its own people, which is rare in American history. American imperialism has to use naked fascist methods to maintain its rule at home, once again deeply exposing its paper tiger nature of being strong on the outside but weak on the inside.

Although in the past four years, during each wave of anti-violence struggles, many black fighters have fallen in pools of blood, many have been injured, and tens of thousands have been thrown into prison, the indomitable blacks are not intimidated by any violence; instead, they have seen more clearly that the American ruling class is their sworn enemy, further strengthening their fighting spirit and enriching their fighting experience. The flames of black anti-violence struggles are like wildfires in the spring, burning more fiercely.

The Blows to the American Ruling Class Are Getting Heavier

Large-scale black anti-violence struggles have mainly occurred in some of America's major cities and industrial centers, dealing a heavy blow to American imperialism both politically and economically.

Over the past four years, America's largest city, New York, its second-largest city, Chicago, its third-largest city, Los Angeles, and its fifth-largest city, Detroit, have all been major battlefields for black anti-violence struggles. The new wave of black anti-violence struggles this time has not only affected New York, Chicago, Detroit, the sixth-largest city, Baltimore, and the steel center, Pittsburgh, but also the capital, Washington, has become the first target.

Because Washington is the heart of American imperialism and has always been under the strict control of the American ruling class, it has not seen black violent struggles in the past few years. Last summer, blacks in Washington broke through the shackles of reactionary rule and surged onto the streets to fight bravely with the police, and this year, as soon as the anti-violence struggles began, it became the center of the storm. For three whole days, Washington was filled with smoke, and block after block of streets were reduced to rubble. Brave black masses lit fires just a mile or two from the lair of the American imperialist leader, Johnson, in the White House. Johnson was so frightened that he immediately ordered more than 13,000 regular troops into the city, working with thousands of national guardsmen and armed police to suppress blacks. The city was patrolled every few steps, with tanks surrounding the White House and machine guns set up on the steps of the Capitol; soldiers in helmets and bayonets, on high alert, fully exposing the American ruling class's panic-stricken state, terrified by the brave struggles of the black masses.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "National struggles, in the final analysis, are a class struggle issue." The new awakening of American blacks, with more and more blacks taking up arms and walking the path of armed anti-violence struggles, is a prominent manifestation of the intensification of class contradictions within the United States. At the same time, it is a new call for the entire exploited and oppressed American people to oppose the brutal rule of the monopoly capitalist class. Since the end of World War II, American imperialism has been madly pursuing a policy of aggression and expansion abroad, thus inevitably attacking the American people politically and economically, carrying out brutal oppression and exploitation of American working people. The more than 20 million American blacks at the bottom of American society have become the primary victims of American imperialism's reactionary domestic and foreign policies. This has further promoted the awakening of American blacks, making their struggles flourish continuously.

The American reactionary ruling class attempts to tighten the use of violent suppression and political deception, especially the use of violent suppression, to extinguish the flames of black struggles. However, as Chairman Mao pointed out: "'Lifting a rock only to drop it on one's own feet,' is a Chinese saying used to describe the behavior of some fools. The reactionaries of all countries are just such a bunch of fools. The various persecutions they inflict on revolutionary people ultimately can only promote broader and more intense revolutions among the people." The facts of the American blacks' struggles over the past four years fully confirm Chairman Mao's wise judgment. The increasingly awakened American blacks are not something that any violence of the reactionaries can subdue; they will surely unite more closely with the broad masses of white laborers in America and fight shoulder to shoulder with the revolutionary people of all countries to bury the evil system of colonialism and imperialism!

    美国黑人在加速觉醒中
    毛主席一九六三年发表支持美国黑人斗争声明以来黑人斗争发生巨大飞跃
    新华社十八日讯　本社记者述评：哪里有压迫，哪里就有反抗。在美国垄断资产阶级残暴统治下的美国本土，苦大仇深的广大劳苦黑人站起来战斗了！无产阶级的伟大导师毛主席一九六三年八月八日发表的第一个关于支持美国黑人斗争的声明，有力地鼓舞了美国黑人争生存、求解放的斗争。从那以后的四年多时间里，美国黑人的斗争发生了巨大的飞跃，走上了用革命的暴力反对反革命暴力的道路，其势如燎原烈火，越烧越猛，烧得美帝国主义焦头烂额，叫苦连天，显示出在美国黑人中蕴藏着极其强大的革命力量。毫无疑问，毛主席关于支持美国黑人斗争的第二个声明的发表，必将进一步促进美国黑人的觉醒，使他们争取解放的正义斗争更加汹涌澎湃地向前发展。
    美国黑人走上暴力斗争的道路，标志着他们的加速觉醒；而通过斗争，他们又进一步认识到了自己的力量，从而更增强了他们的斗志，更坚定了他们走这条道路的决心。正因为如此，四年多来，美国黑人的暴力自卫斗争，一浪高过一浪；他们最近掀起的这场抗暴斗争新风暴，其来势之迅猛、声势规模之浩大，又超过了往年。他们的英勇斗争沉重地打击了美帝国主义，赢得了全世界革命人民的热烈赞扬和强大声援。
    黑人抗暴斗争怒涛势不可挡
    四年多来，美国黑人抗暴斗争的怒涛滚滚向前发展，势不可挡。
    一九六四年七月，纽约哈莱姆区黑人群众奋起用暴力反抗警察的法西斯暴行，吹响了城市黑人大规模抗暴斗争的号角。从那以后，美国黑人接连三个夏天掀起了一次比一次迅猛、激烈的抗暴斗争高潮；波及的城市由最初的几个，到十几个、几十个，最后扩展到去年夏天的近百个。在斗争中，黑人群众怀着对种族主义压迫和剥削的强烈愤怒，点燃了无数起冲天烈火，捣毁了许许多多白人剥削者的当铺、商店，使一些重要工业中心一度陷于瘫痪；黑人狙击手还四处出击，狠狠打击法西斯军警。这一切都是对统治阶级的“法律”和“秩序”的公开挑战，使美国垄断资本在国内的反动统治受到了极其猛烈的冲击。
    就在过去四年抗暴斗争蓬勃发展的基础上，今年四月美国黑人比往年提前掀起了一场抗暴斗争的新风暴。这场风暴的来势空前迅猛，有如狂飙烈焰，在短短一周中就席卷了一百二十多个大小城市，给了美国统治集团以空前沉重的打击，使得正在侵越战场上连遭失败，国内又发生严重财政金融危机的美帝国主义，更加陷于四面楚歌、狼狈不堪的困境。
    黑人群众空前觉醒
    黑人抗暴斗争的不断高涨，标志着美国广大黑人群众在政治上的加速觉醒。
    一九六四年在哈莱姆区，一九六五年在瓦茨区，一九六六年在芝加哥，一九六七年在纽瓦克和底特律，以及最近在华盛顿、巴尔的摩和堪萨斯城……一次又一次的大规模抗暴斗争，使广大黑人群众受到了有益的锻炼；他们越来越清楚地意识到自己的强大力量，他们的战斗意志也越来越旺盛。
    美国统治集团对黑人的血腥镇压，从反面教育了广大黑人群众，使越来越多的黑人懂得了以革命的暴力来对付反革命暴力的绝对必要性。从一九六五年瓦茨区黑人拿起枪枝武器同反动军警战斗开始，在各地的抗暴斗争中，都普遍出现了越来越多的黑人狙击手。英勇的黑人狙击手们从屋顶、从窗口、从飞驰着的汽车上，向那些对黑人逞凶肆虐的法西斯军警开枪，打得这些家伙胆战心惊，无处藏身。有不少城市的黑人在抗暴斗争中，打开枪枝商店或兵器库，夺取枪枝武装自己。
    特别值得提到的是，黑人中的新的一代，在抗暴斗争中经受血与火的洗礼而迅速成长起来。他们都是一些年龄不足二十五岁的青年，出生在大城市黑人区的贫民窟，从小就挣扎在饥饿和死亡线上，过着暗无天日的生活。因此，他们对统治集团的奴役和剥削有着无比强烈的仇恨。他们在斗争中无所畏惧，勇敢顽强，无论是监狱、枪弹、毒瓦斯都吓不倒他们。他们之中的一些先进分子已经开始认识到，除非彻底摧毁帝国主义制度，黑人不可能真正获得解放。这些人正在黑人斗争中起着越来越显著的作用。
   美国统治集团吓得丧魂落魄
    面对着黑人抗暴斗争如火如荼的发展，美国统治集团再也顾不得什么“自由”、“民主”的伪装，越来越赤裸裸地露出了法西斯的狰狞嘴脸。
    四年多来，美国统治集团为了镇压黑人的抗暴斗争，不仅使用警棍、皮鞭、催泪瓦斯、刺刀、机关枪，甚至出动装甲车、坦克和直升飞机。而在最近的黑人抗暴斗争中，惊恐万状的约翰逊政府竟悍然出动了六万多名正规军和国民警卫队，配合各地武装警察疯狂镇压黑人群众，另外还有两万多名正规军待命随时出动镇压。美国统治集团出动如此大量的军队来对付本国人民的革命斗争，这在美国历史上是罕见的。美帝国主义不得不使用赤裸裸的法西斯手段来维持它在国内的统治，这就再一次深刻暴露了它的外强中干的纸老虎本质。
    尽管四年多来，在历次抗暴斗争中都有不少黑人战士在血泊中倒下，大批黑人受伤，成千上万的黑人被投入监狱，但是坚强不屈的黑人是任何暴力吓不倒的，相反，他们更加看清了美国统治集团是他们不共戴天的敌人，更加增强了他们的斗争意志，丰富了他们的斗争经验。黑人抗暴斗争的烈火正如春风野火，越烧越旺。
    对美国统治集团的打击越来越沉重
    大规模的黑人抗暴斗争主要发生在美国的一些大城市和工商业中心，这就在政治上、经济上都给了美帝国主义沉重的打击。
    过去四年中，美国第一大城市纽约、第二大城市芝加哥、第三大城市洛杉矶、第五大城市底特律都曾经是黑人抗暴斗争的主要战场。最近这次黑人抗暴斗争的新风暴，不仅波及了纽约、芝加哥、底特律、第六大城市巴尔的摩以及钢铁中心匹兹堡等重要工商业中心，而且美国的首都华盛顿也变成了首当其冲的战场。
    由于华盛顿是美帝国主义的心脏，一向受到美国统治集团极为严密的控制，前几年一直没有爆发过黑人的暴力斗争。去年夏天，华盛顿的黑人开始冲破反动统治的桎梏，涌上街头同警察进行了英勇搏斗，而今年，抗暴斗争一开始，它就成了这次风暴的中心。在整整三天的时间里，华盛顿烟火弥漫，成片成片的街区被烧成了瓦砾堆。英勇的黑人群众，就在离美帝头子约翰逊的巢穴白宫不过一两英里的地方点起了一处处熊熊大火，约翰逊吓得坐立不安，赶忙下令把一万三千多名正规军调进市内，配合数千名国民警卫队和武装警察，对黑人进行镇压。市内三步一哨、五步一岗，白宫周围摆上了坦克，国会大厦的台阶上架起了机关枪；士兵们头戴钢盔、手端刺刀，如临大敌，充分暴露了美国统治集团被黑人群众的英勇斗争吓破了胆的窘状。
    毛主席教导我们：“民族斗争，说到底，是一个阶级斗争问题。”美国黑人的新觉醒，越来越多的黑人拿起武器走上武装抗暴的道路，正是美国国内阶级矛盾激化的一个突出表现，同时也是整个被剥削、被压迫的美国人民反对垄断资产阶级残暴统治的新号角。第二次世界大战结束以来，美帝国主义对外疯狂地实行侵略、扩张政策，这样，就不能不首先从政治上、经济上进攻美国人民，对美国劳动人民进行残酷的压迫和剥削。处在美国社会最底层的两千多万美国黑人，就成了美帝国主义的反动的国内外政策的首当其冲的受害者。这就更加促进了美国黑人的觉醒，使他们的斗争不断蓬勃发展。
    美国反动统治集团妄图加紧使用暴力镇压和政治欺骗的反革命两手，特别是暴力镇压的一手，来扑灭黑人斗争的烈火。但是，正如毛主席所指出的：“‘搬起石头打自己的脚’，这是中国人形容某些蠢人的行为的一句俗话。各国反动派也就是这样的一批蠢人。他们对于革命人民所作的种种迫害，归根结底，只能促进人民的更广泛更剧烈的革命。”四年多来美国黑人斗争的事实，完全证实了毛主席的这一英明论断。日益觉醒的美国黑人，是美国反动派的任何暴力都压服不了的，他们必将更紧密地同美国白人中的广大劳动人民团结在一起，同世界各国革命人民并肩战斗，把万恶的殖民主义、帝国主义制度彻底埋葬！
