Congolese (Kin) freedom fighters warmly hail Chairman Mao's great statement
Follow the direction of struggle pointed out by Chairman Mao
Carry on the armed struggle against the U.S. to the end

According to a Xinhua News Agency report on the 27th, Congolese (Kin) freedom fighters warmly hail Chairman Mao's statement supporting the struggle of American blacks against violence. They also expressed their determination to follow the course pointed out by Chairman Mao, continue the armed struggle, and carry on the struggle against U.S. imperialism to the end.

A Congolese (Kin) freedom fighter named Mampasi said, "Chairman Mao's statement is a great encouragement to us Congolese (Kin) freedom fighters. It makes us and American blacks understand that our struggle is not isolated; the 700 million Chinese people always stand on the side of the peoples of the world."

He said, Chairman Mao has repeatedly issued statements supporting the liberation movements of various countries. On November 28, 1964, Chairman Mao issued the "Statement Supporting the Congolese (Léopoldville) People's Struggle Against U.S. Aggression," which shows how much the great teacher Chairman Mao loves the oppressed and exploited peoples of the world! He said, "Chairman Mao is the savior of the oppressed and exploited peoples of the world. For the revolutionary peoples of the world, Mao Zedong Thought is the most powerful ideological weapon; no reactionary force can defeat the people who have armed themselves with Mao Zedong Thought."

A freedom fighter named Tabu said, "The assassination of Martin Luther King proves the correctness of the Marxist-Leninist and Mao Zedong Thought thesis that there can be no peaceful coexistence between the oppressors and the oppressed."

He said, "We Congolese (Kin) freedom fighters have made up our minds to continue the armed struggle and to study and apply the invincible Mao Zedong Thought in the struggle. We will carry on this people's war against the number one enemy of the revolutionary peoples of the world—U.S. imperialism—to the end. Victory will surely be ours."

A freedom fighter named Weller said, "The path of armed struggle is the correct path. Because imperialism is armed, we the oppressed peoples must also arm ourselves and strike back in kind." He said, "Now, Chairman Mao has pointed out the direction of our struggle. As long as we hold high the red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and always follow the teachings of our heart's red sun, Chairman Mao, the U.S. imperialists, Soviet revisionists, and reactionaries of all countries will all be wiped out, and we will surely achieve thorough liberation."

    刚果（金）自由战士热烈欢呼毛主席的伟大声明
    遵循毛主席指明的斗争方向
    把反美的武装斗争进行到底
    据新华社二十七日讯　刚果（金）自由战士们热烈欢呼毛主席支持美国黑人抗暴斗争的声明。他们还纷纷表示，决心遵循毛主席所指出的航向，继续进行武装斗争，把反对美帝国主义的斗争进行到底。
    一位名叫芒帕西的刚果（金）自由战士说：“毛主席这一声明，对我们刚果（金）自由战士是一个巨大鼓舞，它使我们和美国黑人懂得，我们的斗争不是孤立的，七亿中国人民始终是站在世界各国人民的一边。”
    他说，毛主席曾经多次发表声明，支持各国人民的解放运动。一九六四年十一月二十八日，毛主席发表了《支持刚果（利）人民反对美国侵略的声明》，这表明了伟大导师毛主席对世界被压迫、被剥削的人民是多么的热爱！他说：“毛主席是全世界被压迫、被剥削人民的救星。对于世界革命人民来说，毛泽东思想是最强大的思想武器，任何反动势力都不能战胜已经用毛泽东思想武装起来的人民。”
    一位名叫塔布的自由战士说：“马丁·路德·金的被暗杀，证实了马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想关于在压迫者和被压迫者之间是不可能存在和平共处的这一论断的正确性。”
    他说：“我们刚果（金）自由战士已经下定决心继续进行武装斗争，并且决心在斗争中活学活用战无不胜的毛泽东思想。我们要把反对世界革命人民的头号敌人——美帝国主义的这场人民战争进行到底。最后胜利一定属于我们。”
    一位名叫韦勒的自由战士说：“武装斗争的道路才是正确的道路。因为帝国主义是武装起来的，我们被压迫人民也必须武装起来，针锋相对予以反击。”他说：“现在，毛主席又给我们指明了斗争的方向。只要我们高举毛泽东思想红旗，永远遵循我们心中的红太阳毛主席的教导，什么美帝国主义者、苏联修正主义者以及各国反动派，都将统统被消灭，我们必将得到彻底的解放。”
