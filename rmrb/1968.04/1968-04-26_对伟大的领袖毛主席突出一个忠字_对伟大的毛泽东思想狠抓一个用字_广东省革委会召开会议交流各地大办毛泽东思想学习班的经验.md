The revolutionary masses, revolutionary cadres, and Red Guards of Guangdong Province have been emphasizing loyalty to the great leader Chairman Mao and the application of Mao Zedong Thought. They have been holding various types of Mao Zedong Thought study classes, achieving remarkable results. By the beginning of April this year, various types of Mao Zedong Thought study classes held in all regions, industries, and systems across the province had reached 180,000 sessions, with over 16 million people participating. These study classes have become crucibles for tempering the red hearts of the revolutionary masses, revolutionary cadres, and Red Guards, who are infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao. They have become classrooms for implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions, battlefields for criticizing and repudiating revisionism and carrying out class struggle and the struggle between the two lines. They have effectively consolidated and developed revolutionary unity and the three-in-one combination, promoted the struggle, criticism, and transformation in various units, and advanced the thought revolutionization of the revolutionary masses across the province. The revolutionary situation and industrial and agricultural production in the province have been getting better and better.

Recently, the Guangdong Provincial Revolutionary Committee held a symposium attended by representatives from various prefectures' revolutionary committees, representatives from the People's Liberation Army, and representatives from grassroots units that have done well in studying the works of Chairman Mao. The symposium reviewed, summarized, and exchanged experiences on the half-year-long campaign of holding Mao Zedong Thought study classes and proposed tasks for the future.

Since last October, the revolutionary people of Guangdong Province have responded enthusiastically to Chairman Mao's great call, launching a campaign to hold study classes. From cities to rural areas, from factories, offices, schools to neighborhoods, various types of Mao Zedong Thought study classes have been held extensively across the province, becoming more and more numerous and better and better.

The prominent feature and experience of holding Mao Zedong Thought study classes in various places in Guangdong Province is to emphasize loyalty to Chairman Mao, Mao Zedong Thought, and Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line with an emphasis on the character "loyalty" and to grasp the application of Mao Zedong Thought with the character "use." They believe that by emphasizing "loyalty" and grasping "use," the ideological level of the broad revolutionary masses and revolutionary cadres can be raised to a new height and a new level. They can win battles in the struggle against selfishness and revisionism, pushing the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution from one victory to another. In their studies, the revolutionary masses measure and judge their thoughts and actions by whether they are loyal to Chairman Mao, loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, and loyal to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. The revolutionary masses in Shantou Region shared their experiences, saying that study classes should emphasize "loyalty" to correct attitudes, have "loyalty" in mind to examine thoughts, and implement "loyalty" in actions. With boundless loyalty to Chairman Mao in their hearts, they can see clearly and firmly uphold the party spirit of the proletarian vanguard, stand on the proletarian revolutionary line of Chairman Mao, and advance bravely according to Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment.

Many places and units in Guangdong Province have held Mao Zedong Thought study classes to establish boundless loyalty to Chairman Mao. The main methods are as follows: First, study Chairman Mao's leadership in the great struggles of the Chinese revolution, so that the broad revolutionary masses can have a deeper understanding of Chairman Mao's unparalleled wisdom and greatness from the great struggles of the Chinese revolution, and raise their proletarian feelings for the great teacher, great leader, great supreme commander, and great helmsman Chairman Mao to a higher level and a new realm. Second, take Comrade Lin Biao as a shining example, study Comrade Lin Biao's boundless loyalty to the great leader Chairman Mao, boundless loyalty to the great Mao Zedong Thought, and boundless loyalty to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. Repeatedly study Comrade Lin Biao's high evaluation of Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong Thought, and raise the understanding of Mao Zedong Thought to the level of Comrade Lin Biao's evaluation. Third, conduct extensive class education. Comrade Lin Biao teaches us, "If one does not understand what class is and what exploitation is, one does not understand revolution." There are many methods of conducting class education, the main ones being reminiscing about bitterness and sweetness, recalling contrasts, carrying out revolutionary criticism, arousing the broad revolutionary masses' deep hatred for the Chinese Khrushchev and the counter-revolutionary two-faced traitor Tao Zhu and his agents in Guangdong, and arousing the broad revolutionary masses' boundless love and loyalty to Chairman Mao. Fourth, conduct a mass movement of "three loyalties" with the content of studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought and fully implementing Chairman Mao's series of latest instructions.

Loyalty is shown in actions. The study classes in various places in Guangdong Province have striven to carry forward Chairman Mao's personally advocated revolutionary learning style of combining theory with practice. After studying the works of Chairman Mao and Chairman Mao's latest instructions, they have focused on the character "use." Their experiences are as follows: First, study classes should have clear purposes and targets, study for the revolution, and study to transform both the subjective and objective worlds. Therefore, study classes must adhere to the line of "criticizing selfishness and repudiating revisionism," bring problems and active thoughts from the struggle between the two classes and two lines, grasp the main contradictions, focus on key issues, and find answers in Chairman Mao's great instructions. One period should thoroughly study one or two revolutionary viewpoints and solve one or two problems, concentrating forces to fight annihilation battles. Study classes held in this way have good effects. Second, use Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon to fiercely criticize selfishness and thoroughly repudiate revisionism, combining the criticism of selfishness with the repudiation of revisionism. The universal method adopted by study classes in various places is to study one revolutionary viewpoint of Chairman Mao, expose and criticize one reactionary fallacy of the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents in Guangdong, eliminate their poison in one aspect, deepen the understanding of one problem, and correct the attitude towards one thing. Third, carry forward the spirit of self-criticism, voluntarily expose, actively criticize, and resolutely change the "selfishness" in one's mind, fighting a proactive battle to transform one's worldview.

This symposium, based on the achievements already made, has put forward new requirements. It requires all levels of revolutionary committees to further grasp the work of holding study classes, fully mobilize the broad revolutionary masses to continue and extensively hold various types of Mao Zedong Thought study classes, making them more numerous and better, so that everyone who should participate in the study classes has the opportunity to do so. Holding study classes should especially advocate grassroots initiatives and self-organized classes by the masses. Study classes should continue to hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, continue to emphasize the character "loyalty" to Chairman Mao, Mao Zedong Thought, and Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, and continue to grasp the character "use" in studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought, tempering the red hearts of the revolutionary masses to be even redder. Study classes should adhere to the struggle between the two lines as the basic content, closely link with the actual class struggle and the struggle between the two lines in each period, combine with the revolutionary criticism and the struggle, criticism, and transformation in one's own unit, deeply study Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, thoroughly criticize the revisionist line of the Chinese Khrushchev, and raise the class consciousness and the consciousness of the struggle between the two lines of the broad revolutionary masses and revolutionary cadres to a new level. Study classes should continue to play a great role in implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions, making Chairman Mao's latest instructions fully implemented, closely following Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, and seizing the overall victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. All levels of revolutionary committees should strengthen the leadership of the mass movement of studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought, with all levels of leading members taking the lead in studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought well, emphasizing proletarian politics, going deep among the masses, and timely summarizing and exchanging experiences in holding Mao Zedong Thought study classes well, promoting the mass movement of studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought to be more extensive and in-depth across the province.

    对伟大的领袖毛主席突出一个忠字
    对伟大的毛泽东思想狠抓一个用字
    广东省革委会召开会议交流各地大办毛泽东思想学习班的经验
    新华社广州二十五日电　广东全省无产阶级革命派、革命群众、红卫兵小将，对伟大领袖毛主席心怀一个“忠”字，对战无不胜的毛泽东思想狠抓一个“用”字，坚持以两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线斗争为纲，大办各种类型的毛泽东思想学习班，取得很大成绩。到今年四月上旬，全省各地区、各行业、各系统先后举办的各种类型的毛泽东思想学习班，已达十八万多期，参加学习的有一千六百多万人。这些学习班，成了广大无产阶级革命派、革命群众、革命干部和红卫兵小将锤炼无限忠于毛主席的红心的熔炉，成了落实毛主席最新指示的课堂，成了斗私批修、大搞阶级斗争和两条路线斗争的战场，有力地巩固和发展了革命大联合和革命三结合，推动了各单位的斗批改，促进了全省革命人民群众的思想革命化，使全省无产阶级文化大革命和工农业生产形势越来越好。
    最近，广东省革命委员会召开了有各专区革委会代表、解放军指战员代表和各地学习毛主席著作较好的基层单位的代表参加的座谈会，对半年来大办毛泽东思想学习班进行了检查、总结，交流了经验，提出了今后的任务。
    从去年十月以来，广东全省革命人民坚决响应毛主席的伟大号召，掀起了大办学习班的热潮，从城市到农村，从工厂、机关、学校到街道，全省各地区、各行业、各系统普遍举办各种类型的毛泽东思想学习班，越办越多，越办越好。
    突出对毛主席、对毛泽东思想、对毛主席的无产阶级革命路线无限忠心的一个“忠”字；狠抓对毛泽东思想的一个“用”字，是广东省各地举办毛泽东思想学习班的突出特点和经验。他们认为，“忠”字突出了，
  “用”字抓住了，就可以把广大革命群众、革命干部的无产阶级觉悟提高到一个新的高度，上升到一个新的境界；就可以在斗私批修的战场上打胜仗，把无产阶级文化大革命从一个胜利推向另一个胜利。广大革命群众在学习中，把自己的思想、言行提到是否忠于毛主席，忠于毛泽东思想，忠于毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的高度来衡量，来鉴别。汕头地区的革命群众谈到他们的体会时说，学习班要抓“忠”字端正态度，心怀“忠”字检查思想，落实“忠”字见行动。胸怀对毛主席的无限忠心，就心明眼亮，就能坚持无产阶级先锋队的党性，就能站在毛主席无产阶级革命路线的立场上，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署奋勇前进。
    广东省许多地方、许多单位举办毛泽东思想学习班，树立对毛主席的无限忠心，主要的做法是：一、学习毛主席领导中国革命的伟大斗争实践，使广大革命群众从我国革命的伟大斗争实践中，更深刻地认识毛主席的无比英明，无比伟大，把对伟大导师、伟大领袖、伟大统帅、伟大舵手毛主席的无产阶级感情，提高到一个更高的水平，上升到更新的境界。二、以林副主席为光辉榜样，学习林副主席无限忠于伟大领袖毛主席、无限忠于伟大的毛泽东思想、无限忠于毛主席的无产阶级革命路线。反复学习林副主席对毛主席、对毛泽东思想的崇高评价，把对毛泽东思想的认识水平提高到林副主席评价的高度。三、大抓阶级教育。林副主席教导我们：“不懂得什么是阶级，不懂得什么是剥削，就不懂得革命。”进行阶级教育的方式方法各地经验很多，其中主要的是搞忆苦思甜、回忆对比，开展革命的大批判，激发广大革命群众对中国赫鲁晓夫和反革命两面派陶铸及其在广东的代理人的无比仇恨，激发广大革命群众对毛主席无限热爱、无限忠心的无产阶级感情。四、以活学活用毛泽东思想、全面落实毛主席一系列最新指示为内容，开展“三忠于”的群众运动。
    忠不忠，看行动。广东省各地学习班努力发扬毛主席亲自倡导的理论联系实际的革命学风，学了毛主席著作、毛主席的最新指示，特别着重在“用”字上狠下功夫。他们的体会是：一、办学习班要有明确的目的性和针对性，为革命而学，为改造主观世界和客观世界而学。因此，学习班必须坚持以“斗私，批修”为纲，带着两个阶级、两条路线斗争中的问题和活思想，抓住主要矛盾，突出重点，从毛主席的伟大指示中找答案；一期学透一两个革命观点，解决一两个问题，集中兵力打歼灭战。这样办的学习班，效果都好。二、以毛泽东思想为武器，狠斗“私”字，猛批修正主义，把斗私和批修结合起来，这样斗私才能斗得深，批修也才能批得透。各地学习班普遍采用的办法是，学习毛主席的一个革命观点，对照、揭发、批判中国赫鲁晓夫及其在广东的代理人的一个反动谬论，肃清其在一个方面的流毒，加深对一个问题的认识，端正对一件事情的态度。三、发扬自我批评精神，对头脑中的“私”字，自觉地亮，主动地斗，坚决地改，打改造世界观的主动仗。
    这次会议在总结已经取得的成绩的基础上，又提出了新的要求。要求各级革命委员会进一步抓好办学习班的工作，充分发动广大革命群众持续办，层层办，把各种类型的毛泽东思想学习班办得更多、更好，使每个应该参加学习班学习的人都有机会参加学习。办学习班，要特别提倡基层办，群众自己动手办。学习班要更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，继续大力突出无限忠于毛主席、无限忠于毛泽东思想、无限忠于毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的“忠”字，继续狠抓活学活用毛泽东思想的“用”字，把革命群众永远忠于毛主席的红心锻炼得更红。办学习班要坚持以两条路线斗争为基本内容，密切联系各个时期阶级斗争、两条路线斗争的实际，结合革命的大批判和本单位的斗、批、改，深入学习毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，彻底批判中国赫鲁晓夫的修正主义路线，把广大革命群众和革命干部的阶级觉悟和路线斗争觉悟提高到一个新的水平。要继续发挥学习班在落实毛主席的最新指示中的伟大作用，使毛主席的最新指示全面落实，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利。各级革命委员会要加强对活学活用毛泽东思想群众运动的领导，各级领导成员要带头学好用好毛泽东思想，突出无产阶级政治，深入群众，及时地总结交流办好毛泽东思想学习班的经验，推动全省活学活用毛泽东思想伟大群众运动更加广泛深入地开展。
