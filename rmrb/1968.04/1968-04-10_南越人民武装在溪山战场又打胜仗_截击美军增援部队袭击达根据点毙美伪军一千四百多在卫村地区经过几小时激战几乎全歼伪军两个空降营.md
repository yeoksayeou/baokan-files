The people's armed forces of South Vietnam have recently been continuously attacking enemy forces on the Quang Tri-Da Nang battlefield, inflicting heavy losses on the U.S. and puppet troops.

In the northern part of Quang Tri Province, the people's armed forces in the Xishan area launched fierce ambushes against the U.S. 1st Cavalry Division troops reinforcing the Xishan area from April 3 to 6. They also attacked the U.S. and puppet troops besieged at the Da stronghold, annihilating eight companies of the U.S. 1st Cavalry Division and the U.S. Marine Corps, severely damaging three U.S. battalions, killing 1,443 enemy troops (most of whom were U.S. soldiers), shooting down 16 enemy aircraft, and seizing a large amount of weapons and military supplies.

From March 21 to 31, the people's armed forces in the northern part of Quang Tri Province fought more than 80 battles in the districts of Yu Ling and Cam Lu, killing and wounding 1,014 enemy troops, including 553 U.S. invaders. They destroyed 23 tanks and armored vehicles, 93 other military vehicles, two artillery pieces, three warships, and shot down 15 aircraft.

In the southern part of Quang Tri Province, the people's armed forces launched a fierce artillery attack on the La Vang base, Ai Zi Airport, and the U.S. military base in Chau Phong County on the night of March 26, causing significant losses to the enemy.

From March 26 to 27, the people's armed forces in Thua Thien Province continuously attacked Phu Bai Airport, a base of the U.S. 1st Cavalry Division, a base of a U.S. armored regiment, and other enemy facilities. They killed hundreds of U.S. invaders, destroyed 50 aircraft and 130 military vehicles, burned down dozens of ammunition and fuel depots, and sank two warships.

On March 29 and 31, the people's armed forces continuously ambushed the enemy and launched fierce attacks on the U.S. Marine Corps base in Phu Loc County and other enemy strongholds, annihilating a large number of U.S. and puppet troops. In the battle on March 31, the people's armed forces killed 300 enemy troops (mostly U.S. invaders), destroyed 12 military vehicles and five artillery pieces, blew up two bridges, cut off enemy supply lines, and destroyed many enemy barracks and warehouses.

On April 1, the people's armed forces also attacked the enemy's airfield in Hue City, causing significant losses to the enemy.

The people's armed forces in the Xishan battlefield of Quang Tri Province, South Vietnam, continued their offensive on April 7, inflicting heavy losses on the enemy after several hours of intense fighting, almost completely annihilating two puppet battalions.

The report said that in the afternoon of April 7, the enemy recklessly air-dropped two puppet airborne battalions in the Wei Village area. The people's armed forces, undeterred by fatigue and continuously fighting, launched a surprise attack on the enemy as soon as they began to air-drop. They immediately annihilated many enemy troops.

That night, the people's armed forces, taking advantage of the enemy's disarray, continued to attack the remaining enemy forces and launched a fierce assault, splitting and annihilating the enemy. The enemy suffered continuous heavy blows and was completely paralyzed. The people's armed forces annihilated batch after batch of enemy troops and seized a large amount of weapons and military supplies.
