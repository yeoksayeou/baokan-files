Poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres in the First Brigade of Wengjiamen Commune in Loutian County, Hubei Province, are using Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon, closely combining it with local realities, and systematically and step-by-step conducting special criticism of the counter-revolutionary revisionist line of the Chinese Khrushchev, achieving good results.

In the early stage of carrying out the revolutionary criticism, this brigade adopted the method of "cooking everything in one pot," with many topics criticized in one meeting, scattered firepower, and shallow criticism. Some poor and lower-middle peasants said: The Chinese Khrushchev has spread a lot of poison in the countryside. To thoroughly eliminate it, we must do it like eating lotus root, one section at a time. Revolutionary criticism must also be done one problem at a time to criticize deeply and thoroughly. The cadres and leaders of the revolutionary masses' organizations in this brigade, based on the opinions of the poor and lower-middle peasants, mobilized the masses extensively, closely combined with local realities, and formulated ten special criticism topics. They first concentrated on studying a certain aspect of the wise teachings of the great leader Chairman Mao, and then criticized a certain aspect of the reactionary fallacies and crimes of the Chinese Khrushchev. Since the special criticism began, the revolutionary masses and cadres of the entire brigade have conducted in-depth exposure and criticism of the black goods of counter-revolutionary revisionism advocated and promoted by the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents in Hubei such as Wang Renzhong, including "exploitation is meritorious," "four freedoms," "three independences and one contract," "strike a large area and protect a few," and so on.

	Mobilize the masses extensively to criticize the bourgeoisie together

The great leader Chairman Mao teaches: "Revolutionary war is the war of the masses; it can be waged only by mobilizing the masses and relying on them." When this brigade formulated the topics and carried out in-depth revolutionary criticism, the brigade cadres and leaders of the revolutionary masses' organizations followed Chairman Mao's teachings, extensively and deeply mobilized and organized the broad revolutionary masses to criticize the bourgeoisie. After the broad poor and lower-middle peasants understood the significance of carrying out revolutionary criticism and saw the topics to be criticized, they deeply felt that criticizing the bourgeoisie was a major national affair closely related to themselves. The consciousness and initiative of revolutionary criticism reached an unprecedented height. The sixth production team has thirteen old poor peasants. Because of their age and inconvenient movement, they rarely participated in collective activities in the past. They heard that the Chinese Khrushchev advocated "exploitation is meritorious" and "three independences and one contract," aiming to restore capitalism, and they were so angry that they did not care about day or night, wind or rain, always rushing to participate in the criticism meetings. They said with great indignation: "The Chinese Khrushchev is in cahoots with the landlords, walking the same path, singing the same tune, and trying to make us poor and lower-middle peasants be slaves to the landlords and bourgeoisie again. This big bad guy is our poor and lower-middle peasants' sworn enemy. We must criticize him down and stink him up, and thoroughly eliminate his poison."

	Use the method of remembrance and comparison to raise the class consciousness of the members

In carrying out the special criticism, this brigade extensively used the method of remembrance and comparison, effectively raising the class consciousness of the broad masses. For example, when criticizing the topic of "exploitation is meritorious" and "four freedoms," the broad poor and lower-middle peasants carried out the "four remembrances, four comparisons, and four criticisms" activity. That is, remember the bitterness of being exploited as a hired laborer before liberation, compare the sweetness of standing up and being the master under Chairman Mao's leadership now, and criticize the black goods of "freedom of hiring labor" advocated by the Chinese Khrushchev; remember the bitterness of being exploited by usury before liberation, compare the sweetness of walking the socialist road under Chairman Mao's leadership and establishing credit cooperatives now, and criticize the black goods of "freedom of usury" advocated by the Chinese Khrushchev; remember the bitterness of being exploited by tenant farming before liberation, compare the sweetness of walking the road of socialist agricultural collectivization under Chairman Mao's leadership now, and criticize the black goods of "freedom of land buying and selling" advocated by the Chinese Khrushchev; remember the bitterness of being exploited by capitalists and private merchants before liberation, compare the sweetness of establishing socialist state-owned commerce and supply and marketing cooperatives under Chairman Mao's leadership now, and criticize the black goods of "freedom of operation" and encouraging speculation advocated by the Chinese Khrushchev. Through such remembrance and comparison, in the remembrance and comparison, carrying out revolutionary criticism, the broad poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres loved Chairman Mao even more, loved Mao Zedong Thought even more, loved Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line even more, and were more determined to follow Chairman Mao to walk the socialist road, and hated the Chinese Khrushchev's heinous crime of attempting to restore capitalism even more.

	Closely combine with local realities, criticize and reform at the same time

Closely combining with local realities, criticizing and reforming at the same time, making the criticism, struggle, and reform closely combined, is another important experience of this brigade in carrying out the revolutionary criticism deeply and persistently. This brigade pays attention to combining with solving the most prominent problems in the locality and the active thoughts of cadres and members whenever it carries out a special criticism. For example, in the past, some production teams here adopted a so-called "dead weight" capitalist management method for sideline production. In the special criticism, they guided everyone to criticize and eliminate the poison of "three independences and one contract" advocated by the Chinese Khrushchev from this matter, and immediately abolished the "dead weight" method, implemented the method of sideline production division, specialized leadership, income to the collective, and reasonable remuneration, which was warmly supported by the broad poor and lower-middle peasants.

The revolutionary criticism in the First Brigade of Wengjiamen Commune can be carried out deeply and persistently and achieve remarkable results. The most fundamental reason is to use Mao Zedong Thought to guide the revolutionary criticism, closely combining the mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works with the criticism of the Chinese Khrushchev. This brigade holds various forms of Mao Zedong Thought study classes for brigades and production teams before criticizing each topic, arming the broad masses with Mao Zedong Thought, and then criticizing the reactionary fallacies of the Chinese Khrushchev. The masses say this is "shooting the black target with a red arrow." The advantage is: Mao Zedong Thought can truly be learned and applied in class struggle, learned and applied in class struggle, learned and applied actively, combining learning and application, seeing results immediately, and working hard on the "application." Because Mao Zedong Thought is learned first and then the Chinese Khrushchev is criticized, Mao Zedong Thought is learned and the Chinese Khrushchev is criticized at the same time, it is targeted, so Chairman Mao's great teachings are understood more deeply and applied more actively, and capitalism and revisionism can be eliminated from the mind in the great criticism, and Mao Zedong Thought can be firmly established. The broad poor and lower-middle peasants and cadres in this brigade have raised their consciousness of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works actively through revolutionary criticism. At present, the entire brigade, from the family to the field, is everywhere a classroom for studying and applying Chairman Mao's works actively, and everywhere a battlefield for criticizing and reforming the self. Mao Zedong Thought has been widely spread and popularized unprecedentedly.

    翁家垸公社一大队贫下中农和革命干部开展专题大批判
    学一段毛主席的英明论断  剥一层中国赫鲁晓夫画皮
    据新华社武汉电　怎样在农村把革命大批判广泛、深入、持久、扎实地开展下去？湖北省罗田县翁家垸公社一大队贫下中农和革命干部，以毛泽东思想为武器，紧密结合本队实际，对中国赫鲁晓夫的反革命修正主义路线，有计划、有步骤地进行专题批判，取得了很好的效果。
    这个大队在开展革命大批判的初期，由于采取“一锅煮”的批判方法，一个会上批判的内容很多，火力不集中，批得不深透。有些贫下中农说：中国赫鲁晓夫在农村散布的流毒很多，要彻底肃清，就要象吃藕一样，一节一节地来。革命大批判，也要一个问题一个问题地搞，才能批得深、批得透。这个大队的干部和革命群众组织负责人根据贫下中农的意见，广泛发动群众，紧密结合当地实际，拟定了十个批判专题。他们先集中学习伟大领袖毛主席一个方面的英明论述，再批判中国赫鲁晓夫一个方面的反动谬论和罪行。从开展专题批判以来，全大队的革命群众和干部，已对中国赫鲁晓夫及其在湖北的代理人王任重之流鼓吹和推行的“剥削有功”、“四大自由”、“三自一包”、“打击一大片，保护一小撮”等反革命修正主义黑货进行了深入的揭发和批判。
    广泛发动群众， 同心批判资产阶级
    伟大领袖毛主席教导说：“革命战争是群众的战争，只有动员群众才能进行战争，只有依靠群众才能进行战争。”这个大队在定出专题，深入开展革命大批判时，大队干部和革命群众组织负责人遵照毛主席的教导，广泛、深入地动员、组织广大革命群众都来批判资产阶级。当广大贫下中农了解了开展革命大批判的意义和看到了要批判的专题以后，都深切感到批判资产阶级是同自己密切相关的国家大事，革命大批判的自觉性、积极性空前高涨。第六生产队有十三个老贫农，因为年纪大，行动不方便，过去很少参加集体活动。他们听说中国赫鲁晓夫鼓吹“剥削有功”、“三自一包”，要复辟资本主义，气得了不得，不分白天黑夜，不管风里雨里，总是赶去参加批判会。他们无比愤怒地说：“中国赫鲁晓夫跟地主穿一条裤子，走一个路子，唱一个调子，妄想再让我们给地主、资产阶级当牛马，这个大坏蛋是我们贫下中农不共戴天的敌人，我们一定要把他批倒批臭，彻底肃清他的流毒。”
    采用回忆对比办法，提高社员阶级觉悟
    这个大队在开展专题批判时，广泛地采用回忆对比的办法，有效地提高了广大群众的阶级觉悟。例如在批判“剥削有功”、“四大自由”这个专题时，广大贫下中农就进行了“四忆四比四批”活动。即忆解放前当雇工受剥削的苦，比现在毛主席领导翻了身，当家作主的甜，批判中国赫鲁晓夫鼓吹的“雇工自由”的黑货；忆解放前受高利贷剥削的苦，比现在毛主席领导走社会主义道路，办起信用合作社的甜，批判中国赫鲁晓夫鼓吹的“放高利贷自由”的黑货；忆解放前种佃田受剥削的苦，比现在毛主席领导走社会主义农业集体化道路的甜，批判中国赫鲁晓夫提倡的“土地买卖自由”的黑货；忆解放前受资本家和私商剥削的苦，比现在毛主席领导办起了社会主义国营商业和供销合作社的甜，批判中国赫鲁晓夫提倡的“经营自由”、鼓励投机倒把的黑货。经过这样的回忆对比，在回忆对比中开展革命大批判，广大贫下中农和革命干部更加热爱毛主席，更加热爱毛泽东思想，更加热爱毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，更加坚定了跟毛主席走社会主义道路的信心，更加痛恨中国赫鲁晓夫妄图复辟资本主义的滔天罪行。
    密切结合当地实际，边斗批边改革
    密切结合当地实际，边批边改，使斗批改紧密结合，是这个大队革命大批判深入持久开展的另一项重要经验。这个大队每开展一个专题批判，都注意同解决当地最突出的问题以及干部、社员的活思想相结合。例如，过去这里一些生产队的副业管理采取一种所谓“甩死砣子”的资本主义经营方法。在专题批判中，他们引导大家从这件事来批判和肃清中国赫鲁晓夫鼓吹的“三自一包”的流毒，并立即革了“甩死砣子”的命，实行了副业分组、专人领导、收入归集体、合理计酬的方法，受到了广大贫下中农的热烈拥护。
    翁家垸公社一大队革命大批判能够深入持久地开展下去，并且能够收到显著成效，最根本的是用毛泽东思想统帅革命大批判，把活学活用毛主席著作的群众运动同对中国赫鲁晓夫的大批判紧密结合起来。这个大队每批判一个专题，大队、生产队都先办各种形式的毛泽东思想学习班，用毛泽东思想武装广大群众的头脑，然后再批判中国赫鲁晓夫的反动谬论。群众说这是“用红箭射黑靶”。好处是：对毛泽东思想能够真正做到在阶级斗争中学，在阶级斗争中用，活学活用，学用结合，立竿见影，在“用”字上狠下功夫。由于先学毛泽东思想，再批中国赫鲁晓夫，边学毛泽东思想，边批中国赫鲁晓夫，有针对性，因而对毛主席的伟大教导就理解得更深，用得更活，并能在大批判中促进人的思想革命化，从头脑中肃清资本主义、修正主义的流毒，大立毛泽东思想。这个大队广大贫下中农和干部通过革命大批判，活学活用毛主席著作的自觉性更高了。目前，全大队从家庭到田间，处处都是活学活用毛主席著作的课堂，处处都是斗私批修的战场。毛泽东思想得到空前的大传播、大普及。
