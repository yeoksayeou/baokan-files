The spring ploughing season is a busy time, and the Jijia Guan Zhuang Production Brigade in Jilin County, Shandong Province, has organized study classes based on various agricultural work teams to thoroughly carry out revolutionary criticism, using revolution to lead production. This has achieved remarkable results.

This brigade held eight study classes on Mao Zedong Thought during the winter farming season, which greatly promoted the ideological revolutionization of cadres and community members, and advanced winter agricultural water conservancy construction and preparation work. After the spring ploughing season began, due to the increased agricultural work and inconsistent work hours, it became difficult to hold centralized study classes. At this time, the second production team organized two study classes on Mao Zedong Thought based on agricultural work teams, which proved to be very effective. The brigade leadership discovered this and saw it as a good method for holding study classes during the busy farming season. They actively promoted this method, and soon all five agricultural production teams and one forestry production team in the brigade organized 56 study classes based on various agricultural work teams.

These study classes, organized by agricultural work teams, have fewer participants, shorter durations, focused content, flexible methods, and diverse forms. Each study class focuses on "fighting selfishness and criticizing revisionism," studying a few quotations from Chairman Mao, criticizing a few fallacies of the Chinese Khrushchev's counter-revolutionary revisionism, and addressing a few active thoughts of the community members.

The brigade has deeply realized through practice that organizing study classes by agricultural work teams is a good way to thoroughly and persistently carry out revolutionary criticism. In the past, during the farming off-season, revolutionary criticism was conducted with concentrated time, many people, strong momentum, and widespread mobilization of the masses, which was very necessary. However, the revisionist poison spread by the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents cannot be completely eradicated with just a few criticisms. Things that have been criticized in the past may resurface due to the "selfishness" in people's minds. Therefore, it is necessary to repeatedly and deeply carry out criticism. During the busy farming season, organizing Mao Zedong Thought study classes by agricultural work teams to fight selfishness and criticize revisionism can ensure that the revolutionary criticism is thoroughly and persistently carried out. For example, during the farming off-season, the brigade criticized the revisionist poison of "work points in command" spread by the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents. However, this poison resurfaced during the spring fertilizer application. The fertilizer application team of the second production team held a Mao Zedong Thought study class, studying Chairman Mao's teaching that "political work is the lifeline of all economic work," and further criticized the fallacy of "work points in command." Poor and lower-middle-class community members said: whether it is political leadership or work points in command, this is a major issue of whether to follow the socialist road or the capitalist road. Poor and lower-middle-class community members also said: work points in command is not farming for the revolution but working for work points, which is being poisoned by the Chinese Khrushchev. After the community members' ideological awareness was raised, their enthusiasm was boosted. In the past, when applying fertilizer to the same plot, each small cart would make 13 trips per day; this year, despite spending an extra hour each day for study, they made 15 trips, and the fertilizer was packed full without spillage, significantly improving the quality of the agricultural work.

The Mao Zedong Thought study classes organized by this brigade based on agricultural work teams also address the active thoughts of the community members, actively applying Chairman Mao's teachings, and timely solving the community members' ideological problems. Recently, during the drought-resistant wheat irrigation, it was found that some community members had the active thoughts of "relying on heaven for rain" and "not harvesting in the wheat season and relying on the autumn season," which affected the community members' enthusiasm for drought-resistant wheat irrigation. The drought-resistant wheat irrigation teams of various production teams held Mao Zedong Thought study classes, organizing community members to repeatedly study Chairman Mao's teachings of "preparing for war, preparing for famine, and serving the people," "grain must be grasped," and "all mentalities in cadres that do not go through their own hard work and blood and sweat, but rely on unexpected convenience and luck to win, must be completely eliminated," encouraging community members to consciously use Mao Zedong Thought to examine themselves, and establishing the ideology of self-reliance and hard work. Many community members, with unlimited loyalty to Chairman Mao, actively participated in the drought-resistant wheat irrigation activities. In just three days, they carried water to irrigate nearly 100 mu of wheat in a place far from the water source, and some plots were irrigated twice.

    春耕大忙季节深入开展革命大批判以革命统帅生产
    季家官庄大队大办农活专业队学习班
    新华社济南八日电山东省五莲县街头公社季家官庄大队根据当前春耕大忙的特点，以各种农活专业队为单位举办毛泽东思想学习班，活学活用毛主席著作，深入开展革命大批判，以革命统帅生产，获得了显著的效果。
    这个大队在去冬农闲季节，已经办过八期毛泽东思想学习班，大大促进了干部、社员的思想革命化，推动了冬季农田水利建设和备耕工作。春耕大忙后，由于农活多，上工收工时间不一致，再集中办学习班就比较困难。这时，第二生产队根据新的情况，办了两个按农活专业队为单位的毛泽东思想学习班，效果很好。大队领导班子发现后，认为这是在农忙季节办学习班的一个好办法，便积极推广，全大队五个农业生产队和一个林业生产队很快地办起了各种农活专业队的学习班五十六个。
    这种以农活专业队为单位举办的学习班，人数少，时间短，内容精，方法活，形式多样。每期学习班都以“斗私，批修”为纲，有重点地学习毛主席的几条语录，批判中国赫鲁晓夫反革命修正主义的几个谬论，解决社员的几个活思想。
    这个大队从实践中深深体会到，按农活专业队举办学习班，是深入地持久地开展革命大批判的一种好形式。过去，在农闲季节搞革命大批判时，时间集中，人又多，声势大，火力猛，广泛地发动了群众，这是非常必要的，但是必须看到，中国赫鲁晓夫及其代理人所散布的修正主义毒素，决不是几次批判所能彻底肃清的。过去批判过的东西，以后还会借着人们头脑中的“私”字重新“发芽”。因此，必须反复地深入地进行批判。在农忙季节按农活专业队举办毛泽东思想学习班，进行斗私批修，就可以使大批判深入地持久地开展下去。如大队在农闲季节进行革命大批判时，对中国赫鲁晓夫及其代理人所散布的修正主义毒素“工分挂帅”，虽然已经批判过，但今春送粪时，这个毒素又“冒”了出来。二队送粪专业队举办的毛泽东思想学习班，学习了毛主席“政治工作是一切经济工作的生命线”的教导，进一步批判了“工分挂帅”的谬论。贫下中农社员说：是政治挂帅，还是工分挂帅，这是走社会主义道路还是走资本主义道路的大问题。贫下中农还说：工分挂帅，不是为革命种田，是为工分劳动，这是中了中国赫鲁晓夫的毒。社员群众的思想觉悟提高后，干劲就出来了。往年向同一地块送粪，每天每辆小车送十三趟；今年每天要抽出一个多小时进行学习，却送了十五趟，而且粪篓装得满，路上不抛撒，农活质量显著提高。
    这个大队按农活专业队为单位举办的毛泽东思想学习班，还针对着社员的活思想，活学活用毛主席著作，及时解决社员的思想问题。最近，各队在抗旱浇麦时，发现有些社员群众有“靠天等雨”和“麦季不收靠秋季”的活思想，影响了社员抗旱浇麦的积极性。各生产队抗旱浇麦专业队的毛泽东思想学习班，就组织社员反复学习毛主席“备战、备荒、为人民”，“必须把粮食抓紧”和“干部中一切不经过自己艰苦奋斗、流血流汗，而依靠意外便利、侥幸取胜的心理，必须扫除干净”等教导，发动社员自觉地用毛泽东思想来对照检查自己，树立自力更生、艰苦奋斗的思想。许多社员群众怀着对毛主席的无限忠心，积极投入抗旱浇麦活动，三天之内，就在距离水源很远的情况下，挑水浇麦近一百亩，有些地还浇了两遍。
