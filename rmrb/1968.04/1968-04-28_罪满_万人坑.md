The crimes of the "mass grave"

Gate of the Capital Coal Mine, Bo Delu

Chairman Mao has long said: "The Chinese proletariat suffers from three kinds of oppression (oppression by imperialism, oppression by the bourgeoisie, and oppression by feudal forces), and the severity and cruelty of these oppressions are rare in the history of any nation..." Yet, in the period of the socialist revolution, Chinese Khrushchev still says: "The capitalist system of exploitation in China still has a certain historical progressiveness." The more the capitalists exploit the workers, "the greater your crime, the greater your merit, the greater your progress." These reactionary nonsense words really make us workers' eyes spark with anger! Today, we will reason with him and settle accounts.

	For us old miners of this generation, who among us did not crawl out of the "graveyard" of the old society? We are witnesses to the heinous crimes of the exploiting classes in the old society. Before liberation, there was a riverbank in front of the Gate of the Capital Mine. Who knows how many bones of our class brothers are buried there? At that time, people called it the "mass grave." This four-mile-long "mass grave" cannot hold the crimes and evil of the imperialists, capitalists, and feudal bosses, nor can it contain the hatred and resentment of our working class.

	Before liberation, Gate of the Capital was a hell on earth. Imperialists, capitalists, and feudal bosses plundered and exploited like mad dogs. Miners ate chaff and vegetables, did ghostly work. Working two shifts a day, they still couldn't fill their stomachs. Every day, workers and their families starved to death and were dragged into the "mass grave." Miner Chen Xia'er's wife went to the pithead to fetch water and collapsed from hunger, being eaten alive by wild dogs.

	The heartless imperialists, capitalists, and feudal bosses only thought about how to squeeze the blood out of the workers, not caring about the workers' safety. Workers going up and down the mine in small cages, each time carrying more than thirty people, often had their arms and legs cut off, and some fell into the pit and died. A young worker, because he didn't give the boss a gift, was pushed off the cage before he could steady his feet, resulting in his body being crushed to pieces. There were no safety devices in the mine, and accidents like roof falls, water inrushes, and poisonous gas were common. When work injuries occurred, the bosses and capitalists didn't care at all and even harmed the workers. Once, a tunnel collapsed in the mine, leaving only Zhu Fengjiang alive, buried inside. The foreign devils, capitalists, and bosses not only did not rescue him but also wanted to blow up the mine with explosives. Angry workers took up knives and axes to fight with them, and only then was Zhu Fengjiang rescued.

	Even worse, when workers fell seriously ill, the heartless capitalist vampires, seeing that there was no more oil to squeeze, would carry them alive into the morgue and starve them to death. Some were thrown into the "mass grave" while still breathing.

	Thus, every day, our class brothers were filled into the "mass grave." Capitalists filled their pockets with money, while we workers threw out our bones. Capitalism developed on the bones of our workers, and capitalists grew fat by drinking our blood. What is clearly a bloody crime, Chinese Khrushchev calls "merit" and "progress." He is not a "veteran revolutionary" at all but a thorough traitor and scoundrel, a sworn enemy of our working class.

	Chairman Mao teaches us that class enemies "are not willing to accept national ruin or communism." In the early days of national liberation, Chinese Khrushchev came out shouting "exploitation is meritorious," "exploitation is progressive." This is the howl of vampires, aiming to create counter-revolutionary public opinion and dreaming of restoring their lost "paradise," restoring capitalism, and making us workers suffer again. Chinese Khrushchev, you are truly a maggot in shit, blind in two lives. With us, the working class armed with Mao Zedong Thought, your evil plots will never succeed. Whoever wants to restore the evil capitalism, we, the working class, will fight to the death with him, and make him perish!

    罪满“万人坑”
    门头沟煤矿　薄德禄
    毛主席早就说过：“中国无产阶级身受三种压迫（帝国主义的压迫、资产阶级的压迫、封建势力的压迫），而这些压迫的严重性和残酷性，是世界各民族中少见的；……”可是，到了社会主义革命时期，中国赫鲁晓夫还说：“中国资本主义的剥削制度，还有一定历史的进步性。”资本家“剥削工人越多，不是你的罪恶越大，而是功劳越大，进步越大。”这些反动混账话，真把我们工人气得眼珠子迸火星！今天我们来和他说理算账。
    象我们这一代老矿工，那一个不是从旧社会的死人坑里爬出来的，我们是旧社会、剥削阶级滔天罪恶的见证人。解放前，我们门头沟矿前有一条河滩，这里边不知埋葬了多少阶级兄弟的尸骨，那时人们叫它“万人坑”。这四华里长的“万人坑”，盛不下帝国主义、资本家、封建把头的罪和恶，装不了我们工人阶级的仇和恨。
    解放前的门头沟就是一座人间地狱，帝国主义者、资本家、封建把头象疯狗一样掠夺压榨，矿工吃的是糠菜饭，干的是阴间活。每天连上两个班，都吃不饱肚子，天天都有工人和家属饿死拉进“万人坑”。矿工陈小二的妻子到井台去抬水，饿得昏倒在地，活活被野狗吃掉。
    黑心肠的帝国主义者、资本家、封建把头心里盘算的全是咋样把工人的血榨干，那管工人的生命安全。工人上下矿的小罐笼，一回要装三十多人，常常有人被刮断胳膊腿，还有的落井摔死。一个童工因为没给把头送礼，一次上罐还没站稳脚跟，把头就叫开罐，结果这个童工被挤掉，摔了个粉身碎骨。井下没有一点安全设备，经常发生冒顶、透水、毒气。出了工伤事故，把头、资本家根本不管，而且残害工人。一次井下行道塌了，一班人只剩下朱风江一人，被埋在里边，洋鬼子、资本家、把头不但不抢救，还要用炸药炸井，愤怒的工人拿起刀斧和他们拚命，才救出了朱风江。
    更惨的是工人得了重病，丧尽天良的资本家吸血鬼们眼看再也没有油水可榨，就活着抬进停尸房，活活饿死。有的还没断气就被扔到“万人坑”。
    这样，天天都有我们的阶级兄弟被填进“万人坑”。资本家往口袋里装的是金钱，我们工人往外扔出去的是白骨。资本主义就是在我们工人的尸骨上发展起来的，资本家就是靠喝我们工人的血养得肥头大耳。明明是血淋淋的罪恶，中国赫鲁晓夫却说成是“功劳”和“进步”。他根本不是什么“老革命”，而是地地道道的大叛徒、大工贼，是我们工人阶级的死对头。
    毛主席教导我们说，阶级敌人“他们对于亡国、共产是不甘心的。”中国赫鲁晓夫在全国解放初期，跑出来大喊大叫“剥削有功”，“剥削进步”，这是吸血鬼的嚎叫，就是要制造反革命的舆论，梦想恢复他们失掉的“天堂”，复辟资本主义，让我们工人再受二遍苦。中国赫鲁晓夫，你真是屎虫子投生蛆，两辈子没眼。有我们用毛泽东思想武装起来的工人阶级在，你的罪恶阴谋就永远不会得逞。谁要想复辟那万恶的资本主义，我们工人阶级就和他拚，叫他粉身碎骨！
