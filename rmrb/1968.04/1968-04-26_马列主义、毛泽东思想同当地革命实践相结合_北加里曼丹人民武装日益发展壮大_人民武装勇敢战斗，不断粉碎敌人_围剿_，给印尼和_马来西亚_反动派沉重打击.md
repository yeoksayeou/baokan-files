New York, April 24 (Xinhua) — A recent article in the North Kalimantan *Liberation News* celebrates the growing strength and development of the North Kalimantan people's guerrilla forces active near the Indonesian border in Sarawak. The article highlights how these forces have repeatedly foiled the counter-revolutionary "encirclement and suppression" campaigns launched by the reactionary military of Indonesia's Suharto and the puppet forces of "Malaysia," thereby sustaining and advancing the people's armed struggle.

The article states that over the past year, the people's guerrilla forces in the western border region of North Kalimantan have engaged in frequent battles with invading Indonesian reactionary troops. In the latter half of last year alone, some units fought over thirty times. Although the guerrilla forces have a short combat history, they have proven to be a formidable force. They have repeatedly launched brave attacks on the so-called "elite" and "mobile" reactionary troops, inflicting heavy losses on the enemy. In the eastern border region, the people's armed forces have also fought tenaciously, repeatedly thwarting the enemy's frenzied "encirclement and suppression" campaigns. In one instance, the Indonesian reactionary troops mobilized approximately five thousand men, along with five American-made bombers and helicopters, and naval support. However, the people's armed forces, employing flexible guerrilla tactics, bravely, tenaciously, and cleverly foiled the enemy's schemes.

The article details several heroic battles fought by the people's armed forces. On June 4 of last year, the people's armed forces ambushed a small group of "Malaysian" puppet soldiers, killing three and wounding one, and seizing a batch of weapons and ammunition. In June and July, the people's armed forces annihilated a twelve-man squad of Indonesian reactionary troops, killing eleven and capturing all their modern weapons.

The article points out that the victories achieved by the people's armed forces under extremely difficult conditions are the result of integrating Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought with local conditions. From its inception, the people's armed forces, under the leadership of the North Kalimantan National Liberation Alliance, have carried out the three major tasks of production, combat, and mass work. They have focused on building the ideological foundation of the troops, implementing the "Three-Eight Style," and repeatedly studying Chairman Mao's "Three Constantly Read Articles." This has ensured that every commander and soldier understands for whom they are fighting, is unafraid of hardship and death, and is fully committed to liberating North Kalimantan. In battle, they fight with vigor and overcome all difficulties to achieve continuous victories.

The article emphasizes that the past battles of the North Kalimantan people's armed forces have proven that the Indonesian reactionary troops and "Malaysian" puppet forces are nothing but paper tigers. "No matter how heavy the tasks or how numerous the difficulties, they cannot stop those armed with Mao Zedong Thought." The people's armed forces will certainly shatter the counter-revolutionary "encirclement and suppression" campaigns and sustain and develop the armed struggle.

    马列主义、毛泽东思想同当地革命实践相结合
    北加里曼丹人民武装日益发展壮大
    人民武装勇敢战斗，不断粉碎敌人“围剿”，给印尼和“马来西亚”反动派沉重打击
    新华社二十四日讯  古晋消息：北加里曼丹《解放报》最近发表文章，欢呼活跃在沙捞越接近印尼边界的北加里曼丹人民游击队正在日益壮大和发展，不断粉碎了印尼苏哈托反动军队和“马来西亚”傀儡军队的反革命“围剿”，坚持和发展了人民的武装斗争。
    文章说，最近一年来，北加里曼丹边区西部的人民游击队曾经同来犯的印尼反动军队进行了频繁的战斗，仅去年下半年有的支队作战就达到三十多次。人民游击队虽然作战历史短，但却是一支坚强的部队，他们多次英勇袭击号称“精锐”和“机动”的反动军队，使敌军遭到重大打击。在边区东部的人民武装也顽强作战，多次粉碎了敌军的疯狂“围剿”。一次，印尼反动军队调派约五千人压向东部，还派了美制轰炸机、直升飞机共五架以及海军助战。但是，人民武装灵活运用人民战争的战略战术，勇敢、顽强、机智地挫败了敌人的阴谋。
    文章报道了人民武装一系列英勇作战的事迹。去年六月四日，人民武装伏击一小队“马来西亚”傀儡兵，击毙其中三名，击伤一名，缴获了一批枪支和弹药。六、七月间，人民武装又痛歼印尼反动军队的一支十二人的小队，击毙其中十一名，并缴获了敌人的全部新式武器。
    文章指出，人民武装在极其艰苦的条件下所取得的胜利，是马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想同当地情况相结合的成果。文章说，人民武装从创建之初，就在北加里曼丹民族解放同盟的领导之下，贯彻执行了生产、战斗和搞群众工作的三大任务，大抓部队的思想建设，落实三八作风，反复学习毛主席的
  “老三篇”。使每一个指挥员和战斗员都明确为谁而打仗，不怕苦，不怕死，一心一意为解放北加里曼丹而战斗，打起仗来就生龙活虎，排除万难而不断取得胜利。
    文章强调指出，北加里曼丹人民武装过去的战斗证明，印尼反动军队和“马来西亚”傀儡军队都只不过是一只纸老虎。“任务再重，困难再多，都阻挡不了用毛泽东思想武装起来的人。”人民武装必将粉碎反革命“围剿”，把武装斗争坚持和发展下去。
