Last winter, a powerful earthquake struck the regions of Dibër and Librazhd in Albania, resulting in significant losses of life and property. However, under the warm care and strong leadership of the Labor Party, headed by the great leader of the Albanian people, Comrade Enver Hoxha, the Albanian people managed to rebuild and repair over six thousand three hundred buildings in less than a month. They also arranged for the living needs of the affected residents and completely eliminated the severe consequences of the earthquake.

In this disaster relief effort, the Albanian people demonstrated a high degree of class solidarity, with mutual aid and support from all sides. Many advanced individuals and inspiring stories emerged. The following brief reports reflect the revolutionary spirit of the Albanian people during the relief work.

    山鹰的本色
    ——阿尔巴尼亚人民战胜地震灾害的生动事迹
    去年冬天，阿尔巴尼亚迪勃拉和利布拉什德区发生强烈的地震，造成了人力和物力的损失。但是，在以阿尔巴尼亚人民的伟大领袖恩维尔·霍查同志为首的劳动党的亲切关怀和坚强领导下，阿尔巴尼亚人民仅仅以不到一个月的时间就修建和修复了六千三百多所建筑物，妥善安排了受灾地区居民的生活，完全消除了地震所造成的严重后果。
    在这次救灾工作中，阿尔巴尼亚人民高度发扬阶级友爱的精神，一方有难，八方支援，先人后己，互相帮助，涌现出许多先进人物和生动事迹。这里发表的几篇简短报道，反映了在救灾工作中的阿尔巴尼亚人民的革命精神面貌。
