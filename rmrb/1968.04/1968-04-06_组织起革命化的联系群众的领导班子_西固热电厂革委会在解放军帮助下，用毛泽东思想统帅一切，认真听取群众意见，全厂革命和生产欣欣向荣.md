The revolutionary committee of the Xigu Thermal Power Plant under the Lan Zhou Electricity Bureau, with the help of the People's Liberation Army, has been guided by the thought of Chairman Mao Zedong in everything, seriously listening to the opinions of the masses. The entire plant is thriving in both revolution and production.

A dispatch from Xinhua News Agency in Lanzhou reports: The revolutionary committee of the Xigu Thermal Power Plant under the Lan Zhou Electricity Bureau, with the help of the People's Liberation Army stationed at the plant, has followed the great leader Chairman Mao's teaching of "serving the people wholeheartedly and never leaving the masses." They humbly listen to the opinions of the workers and the grassroots organizations, earnestly transform their work style, emphasize proletarian politics, and promote the thought revolutionization of the revolutionary committee members. As a result, the entire plant is flourishing in both revolution and production.

After its establishment in late October of last year, the revolutionary committee of the Xigu Thermal Power Plant made certain achievements in areas such as cadre participation in labor, emphasizing proletarian politics in work, and connecting with the masses. Later, due to the influence of old habits and lack of experience, the committee members gradually fell into the trap of bureaucratism, busy with administrative tasks, unable to go deep into the masses, and less connected with them. After discovering this problem, the People's Liberation Army support team at the plant used Chairman Mao's teachings on politics being the guiding force and soul to help the committee review and examine their previous work. This made everyone realize that Mao Zedong Thought is the lifeline of the proletarian revolutionary power. Holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, emphasizing proletarian politics, is the fundamental task of the revolutionary committee. The busier the work, the more problems there are, the more we need to study and apply Mao Zedong Thought, and the more we need to emphasize proletarian politics.

To promote the thought revolutionization of the committee members and make the revolutionary committee a revolutionary leadership team that emphasizes proletarian politics, the People's Liberation Army support team at the plant helped the committee, in conjunction with the plant's struggle, criticism, and transformation, launch a revolutionary criticism campaign against the revisionist party-building line of China's Khrushchev among all the workers. Various types of Mao Zedong Thought study classes were held in all sections, workshops, and teams, with over 80% of the workers participating. In these classes, everyone enthusiastically praised Chairman Mao's party-building thoughts and line, and fiercely criticized China's Khrushchev's revisionist party-building line. Through this revolutionary criticism, the committee members and the revolutionary workers significantly enhanced their awareness of class struggle and the struggle between the two lines.

Based on the revolutionary criticism campaign, the revolutionary committee of the Xigu Thermal Power Plant, with the help of the People's Liberation Army support team, followed Chairman Mao's teaching of "consulting the masses on every matter." The committee held a representative meeting, inviting worker representatives, grassroots leadership teams, and worker congress representatives to participate and listen to their opinions and demands for the committee. The committee paid great attention to the opinions and demands from the masses, discussed them specially, and decided to take several measures to maintain constant contact with the masses: establish a "duty system for standing committee members." Except for the committee members who return to their original sections to work, the other members are divided into two shifts. One shift is responsible for work upstairs and establishes a duty system; the other shift goes deep into all sections to fight against selfishness and revise modesty together with the workers, study and labor together, listen to their opinions and demands for the committee, and then bring them back to the committee for discussion. The standing committee members take turns on duty every week, ensuring that every committee member has the opportunity to go deep into the masses and take responsibility for leadership work, making sure that every committee member can maintain the thought and feelings of the working class after a change in position, maintain the good style of being close to and connecting with the masses after a change in work location, and maintain the essence of the working class and laboring people after a change in duty.

They also followed the great leader Chairman Mao's teaching of "conducting heart-to-heart talks, which is a good method" and launched a "three loyalties" heart-to-heart talk campaign throughout the plant, emphasizing loyalty to Chairman Mao, loyalty to Mao Zedong Thought, and loyalty to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. Cadres and workers, old cadres and new cadres, and workers among themselves conducted heart-to-heart talks, using Mao Zedong Thought to fight against selfishness and revise modesty. This greatly deepened the cadres' and workers' profound proletarian feelings towards Chairman Mao, Mao Zedong Thought, and Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. Now, from the plant revolutionary committee to the revolutionary committees of various sections and the leadership groups of classes and teams, everyone places the study of Chairman Mao's works and the emphasis on Mao Zedong Thought in a position higher than everything, greater than everything, earlier than everything, and more important than everything. They use Mao Zedong Thought to direct production and guide everything, making the entire plant present a new scene of seizing revolution and promoting production.

### 组织起革命化的联系群众的领导班子  西固热电厂革委会在解放军帮助下，用毛泽东思想统帅一切，认真听取群众意见，全厂革命和生产欣欣向荣

    组织起革命化的联系群众的领导班子
    西固热电厂革委会在解放军帮助下，用毛泽东思想统帅一切，认真听取群众意见，全厂革命和生产欣欣向荣
    新华社兰州电　兰州电业局西固热电厂革命委员会，在人民解放军驻厂支左人员的帮助下，遵照伟大领袖毛主席“全心全意地为人民服务，一刻也不脱离群众”的教导，虚心听取工人群众和基层组织的意见，认真转变作风，突出无产阶级政治，促进了革命委员会成员的思想革命化，全厂革命和生产呈现出一片欣欣向荣的气象。
    西固热电厂革委会在去年十月下旬成立后，在干部参加劳动、在工作中突出无产阶级政治和联系群众等方面，都取得了一定的成绩。后来，由于旧的习惯势力的影响和经验不足等原因，革委会成员逐渐陷入了事务主义的圈子，每天在上面忙忙碌碌，深入不下去，联系群众也少了。驻厂人民解放军支左人员发现这一问题后，就以毛主席关于政治是统帅、是灵魂的教导，帮助革委会总结、检查前一段的工作，使大家认识到，毛泽东思想是无产阶级革命政权的命根子。高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，突出无产阶级政治，是革命委员会的根本任务。工作越忙，问题越多，越要活学活用、学好用好毛泽东思想，越要突出无产阶级政治。
    为了促进革委会成员的思想革命化，使革命委员会成为一个突出无产阶级政治的革命化的领导班子，驻厂人民解放军支左人员帮助革委会结合本厂的斗、批、改，在全厂职工中开展了一场对中国赫鲁晓夫修正主义建党路线的革命大批判。全厂各分场、科室、班组都举办了各种类型的毛泽东思想学习班，有百分之八十以上的职工参加了学习。在学习班里，人人大讲大颂毛主席的建党思想和建党路线，大批特批中国赫鲁晓夫的修正主义建党路线。通过革命大批判，革委会成员和广大革命职工的阶级斗争和两条路线斗争的觉悟有很大提高。
    在开展革命大批判的基础上，西固热电厂革委会又在人民解放军支左人员的帮助下，遵照毛主席“遇事多和群众商量”的教导，革委会召开了一次具有广泛代表性的座谈会，邀请工人代表、基层领导班子和工代会的代表参加，听取他们对革委会的意见和要求。厂革委会对来自群众的意见和要求非常重视，专门进行了讨论，并决定采取几项措施来经常联系群众：在革委会中建立“常委值班制”。革委会的成员，除了在分场担任工作的委员回原分场以外，其他成员分为两班，一班在上面主持工作，建立值班制度；一班深入到各分场去，和工人群众一起斗私批修，一起学习、劳动，听取他们对革委会的意见和要求，然后再带到革委会来研究。值班的常委一个星期轮换一次，使革委会的每个成员都有深入群众和负责领导工作的机会，使革委会每个成员都能做到：在地位发生变化后，工人阶级的思想感情不变；在工作地点发生变化后，接近群众、联系群众的优良作风不变；在职务发生变化后，工人阶级、劳动人民的本色不变。同时，认真对待群众对革委会的批评和意见。例如，群众对革委会没有抓紧处理干部问题有意见，革委会的有关人员就立即深入全厂各个分场去了解情况，和群众一起解决了在干部问题上存在的资产阶级、小资产阶级派性和缩手缩脚的做法，使许多干部站了出来，走上了“抓革命，促生产”的第一线，使革命大联合和革命三结合进一步得到了巩固和发展。
    他们还遵照伟大领袖毛主席“开展谈心活动，这个方法很好”的教导，在全厂范围内掀起了一个忠于毛主席，忠于毛泽东思想，忠于毛主席无产阶级革命路线的“三忠于”谈心活动，干部和工人之间，老干部和新干部之间，工人和工人之间互相谈心，用毛泽东思想斗私批修，大大加深了干部和群众对毛主席、对毛泽东思想、对毛主席无产阶级革命路线的深厚无产阶级感情。现在，全厂从厂革委会到各分场革委会和班、组领导小组，都把学习毛主席著作，突出毛泽东思想摆在高于一切，大于一切，先于一切，重于一切的位置，用毛泽东思想指挥生产，用毛泽东思想统帅一切，使全厂出现一片抓革命促生产的新景象。
