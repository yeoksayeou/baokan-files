The Chinese Khrushchev has repeatedly stirred up the black wind of the "three freedoms and one contract," encouraging his big and small lackeys to shout slogans like, "Having a bit of the bourgeoisie in society is good. These people are very active and know how to exploit loopholes, which can make up for our shortcomings." This is completely a cover-up for the destructive activities of landlords, rich farmers, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists!

Take the recent exposure of a small group of bad elements in our village as an example. These people are indeed "very active" and indeed "know how to exploit loopholes." When the cooperative movement just began, this group of people started their "active" activities, organizing something called "advanced mutual aid teams" to compete with the cooperatives. During the three years of temporary difficulties, this group raised their heads again, "actively" stirring things up. They boasted, "'Three freedoms and one contract' said what they had been wanting to say for ten years but dared not." They also started a "division wind," shaking their heads and shouting, "Few carts, use them in turns; few horses, use them in turns; few threshing grounds, divide them in half." They engaged in speculation, made huge profits, and arrogantly shouted, "Whether poor peasants or rich peasants, making money is good." They seized farmland, recorded more work points, embezzled public funds, colluded with cadres, deceived commune members, occupied important positions, and usurped leadership power. For a time, capitalism spread, evil prevailed, and the village was in chaos.

Our great leader Chairman Mao said: "The problem of counter-revolutionaries sabotaging the cooperative movement is a universal problem. ... All comrades working in the countryside must fully pay attention to the struggle against counter-revolutionary sabotage activities." "It is completely necessary to investigate, purge, and deal with counter-revolutionaries and other bad elements who have infiltrated the leadership of the cooperatives."

Following the great teachings of Chairman Mao, during the Four Clean-ups movement, we removed all the positions they had usurped, stopped the black wind of "three freedoms and one contract," and consolidated and developed the people's communes. During the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, we, under the guidance of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, thoroughly exposed the cover of class struggle, brought them out, and exposed them to the sunlight of Mao Zedong Thought. Our village, which was once a backward unit, has now become an advanced unit in our county.

What kind of vine produces what kind of melon, what class speaks what words. The Chinese Khrushchev, this big boss of landlords, rich farmers, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists, is completely on their side, speaking for them. The "active" people he praises are originally a small group of monsters and demons! The "activity" he advocates is originally their counter-revolutionary nature of promoting capitalism and restoring capitalism! The "exploiting loopholes" he praises is originally their using every opportunity to engage in counter-revolutionary activities to change the sky! The "shortcomings" he wants to make up for are originally to restore their lost paradise! Let me tell you, Chinese Khrushchev, your plot will never succeed! For these bad elements, we will treat them just like you, knock them down to the ground and stomp on them with our feet, so they can never rise again! For their counter-revolutionary "activity," we will firmly strike them down! We will not allow them to exploit any loopholes in socialism!

    不许地富反坏右钻我们的空子
    平谷县马坊公社英城大队
    中国赫鲁晓夫大刮“三自一包”黑风，一次又一次地给他的大小娄罗打气，叫嚷什么“社会上有点资产阶级也很好，这批人积极的很，他们很会钻空子，可以补我们的缺陷。”这完全是在替地富反坏右分子的破坏活动打掩护！
    拿我们村最近破获的一小撮坏人来说吧。这批人确实“积极的很”，确实“很会钻空子”。在合作化运动刚开始的时候，这批人就“积极”活动起来，组织个什么“高级互助组”，同合作社唱对台戏。三年暂时困难时期，这伙人又抬起了脑袋，“积极”活动起来。他们得意忘形地叫嚣：“‘三自一包’说出了十来年憋在心里想说又不敢说的话。”他们还刮起一股“分队风”，摇头晃脑地叫喊：“车少轮着使，马少轮着用，场少分两半。”他们投机倒把，牟取暴利，猖狂叫嚣：“不管贫农富农，能赚钱就是好农。”他们强占耕地，多记工分，贪污公款，拉拢干部，欺诈社员，窃据重要职务，篡夺领导大权。一时间，资本主义泛滥，邪气上升，村子里被他们闹腾得乌烟瘴气。
    我们伟大的领袖毛主席说：“反革命破坏合作化运动的问题，是一个普遍的问题，……一切从事农村工作的同志必须充分地注意这个同反革命的破坏活动作斗争的问题。”“对于混入合作社领导机关里的反革命分子和其他坏分子，加以审查、清洗和处理，是完全必要的。”
    根据毛主席的伟大教导，在四清运动中，我们撤销了他们窃据的一切职务，刹住了“三自一包”黑风，巩固和发展了人民公社。在文化大革命运动中，我们又在毛主席的革命路线的指引下，彻底揭开了阶级斗争的盖子，把他们端了出来，暴露在毛泽东思想的阳光之下。我们村也由历史上的后进队，一跃而为我县的先进单位。
    什么藤结什么瓜，什么阶级说什么话。中国赫鲁晓夫这个地富反坏右分子的总后台，完全是站在他们一边，替他们说话。他所吹捧的“这批人”，原来就是一小撮牛鬼蛇神！他所鼓吹的“积极性”，原来就是他们大搞“三自一包”，进行资本主义复辟的反革命本性！他所赞不绝口的“会钻空子”，原来就是他们利用一切可乘之机进行反革命的变天活动！他所希望“补的缺陷”，原来就是要恢复他们已经失去的天堂！告诉你，中国赫鲁晓夫，你的阴谋，决不能得逞！对于这批坏人，我们就是象对你那样，把他们打翻在地，再踏上一只脚，叫他们永世不得翻身！对于他们的反革命“积极性”，我们就是要坚决打击！社会主义的“空子”，半点也不许他们钻！
