Under the brilliant guidance of the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, the Red Guards of various ethnic groups in the capital of Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, Nanning, achieved revolutionary unity. From March 25 to 28, they solemnly held the first congress of the South Ning Red Guards, announcing the glorious birth of the South Ning Red Guard Congress.

The Red Guards of various ethnic groups in Nanning, who are infinitely loyal to the great leader Chairman Mao, infinitely loyal to the great Mao Zedong Thought, and infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, have, over the past year, held high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought. With the great fearlessness of the proletariat, they have launched a massive struggle against China's Khrushchev and his agents in Guangxi, and against the capitalist reactionary line, becoming the vanguard of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. They have made immortal contributions to the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in Guangxi. They actively responded to the great call of the great leader Chairman Mao to "criticize and repudiate revisionism," and under the strong support and assistance of the People's Liberation Army, they set up Mao Zedong Thought study classes, seriously studied, and resolutely carried out Chairman Mao's latest instructions. They overcame bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism, strengthened proletarian party spirit, and eliminated interference from the right and the ultra-“left.” They firmly followed Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, launching a high tide of revolutionary unity. Many schools established revolutionary committees.

The preparatory group of the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region Revolutionary Committee, the People's Liberation Army Guangxi Military Region, and the responsible comrades of the Nanning garrison, including Wei Guoqing, Ou Zhifu, Wei Youzhu, Jiao Hongguang, Wu Jinnan, and An Pingsheng, attended the congress. Comrade Ou Zhifu, on behalf of the preparatory group of the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region Revolutionary Committee, the Guangxi Military Region, and the Nanning garrison, warmly congratulated the successful convening of the South Ning Red Guard Congress. He hoped that the revolutionary youngsters would hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, continue to set up and run well Mao Zedong Thought study classes, take "criticize and repudiate revisionism" as the key link, fully implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions, consolidate and develop revolutionary unity and the three-in-one combination, further carry out the great criticism, and do a good job in the struggle, criticism, and transformation of their units. They should raise high the banner of "support the army and love the people," strengthen military-civilian unity, strengthen the ideological and organizational construction of the Red Guards, and build the Red Guard forces into an extremely proletarian and extremely combatant proletarian revolutionary army.

The responsible comrade of the conference service group said at the congress that they would definitely follow the teachings of the great leader Chairman Mao, resolutely become revolutionary cadres who will carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end, do a good job in resuming classes and making revolution, and achieve new victories in the great struggle for the comprehensive victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

During the congress, the representatives seriously studied Chairman Mao's instructions on the educational revolution. They unanimously expressed that they would implement Chairman Mao's instructions, thoroughly criticize the counter-revolutionary revisionist educational line, eliminate all its poisonous influences, and truly turn the various schools in Nanning into red schools of Mao Zedong Thought.

Representatives from the Nanning Workers' Congress, the Farmers' Congress, and many other units attended to extend their warm congratulations.

The congress passed a telegram of respect to the most beloved great leader Chairman Mao. It also passed a letter of greeting to the People's Liberation Army, as well as the resolution of the Red Guard Congress and a letter to all Red Guards in the region.
