The New China News Agency reported on the 18th that according to the Oriental News Agency, people from all walks of life in Japan have warmly praised the great statement by Chairman Mao in support of the struggle of black people in the United States against violence. They pointed out that this statement not only greatly encourages the struggle of black people in the United States but also shows the direction for the liberation struggle of the people of all countries in the world.

The chairman of the Japan Committee for Asia-Africa Solidarity, Sakamoto Tokumatsu, said: "Chairman Mao's statement not only encourages the struggle of black people in the United States but also gives courage to workers, peasants, revolutionary intellectuals, and all those who oppose U.S. imperialism around the world, showing them a bright prospect."

Sakamoto said: We will immediately act according to Chairman Mao's wise instruction that "the world revolution has entered a great new era" and give strong support to the struggle of black people in the United States. We must unite closely and launch a prolonged and fierce attack on U.S. imperialism and the reactionary forces in Japan.

Sakamoto said: The broad masses of the Japanese people are striving to study the great thought of Mao Zedong and regard it as a powerful weapon in their struggle.

A representative of the Tokyo Yagura slum, Kaji Daisuke, said: Chairman Mao's statement clearly points out the direction for the people of the world to advance. With Chairman Mao leading us, this is the greatest happiness for the people of the world.

Kaji praised the heroic struggle of black people in the United States, which greatly supports the anti-U.S. national salvation war of the Vietnamese people and the revolutionary struggle of the people of the world.

Kaji expressed his firm response to Chairman Mao's call, saying that he would more forcefully launch a struggle against U.S. imperialism.

Kaji quoted Chairman Mao's statement that imperialism and all reactionaries are paper tigers and pointed out that Chairman Mao's statement is very correct. He said, all reactionaries, on the one hand, brutally suppress the people, and on the other hand, use words like "freedom" and "peace" to deceive the people. But now more and more people have seen through their true faces and are no longer deceived. We must expose the lies of the reactionaries and use revolutionary violence to counter their counter-revolutionary violence.

A young worker from the Tokyo Mitama district, Saito Hiroshi, said: "Chairman Mao's teaching that 'the current world revolution has entered a great new era' is the most correct judgment about the current world revolutionary situation. Chairman Mao calls on 'the people of the world to unite more closely and launch a prolonged and fierce attack on our common enemy, U.S. imperialism and its accomplices!' This is the strongest call to the revolutionary people of the world."

A revolutionary student, Sayama Tadashi, said: "Chairman Mao's statement is a weapon that encourages the struggle of black people and the broad laboring masses of white people in the United States, and a battle cry for all oppressed nations and peoples in the world. This statement has given courage to the youth and students who are at the forefront of the anti-U.S. patriotic struggle in Japan."

He said: "U.S. imperialism is in a dilemma. Chairman Mao teaches us: 'The people of the world must have courage, dare to fight, fear no difficulties, and advance wave upon wave. Then, the whole world will definitely belong to the people.' The current good situation proves that Chairman Mao's teaching is completely correct."

Sayama said: Chairman Mao calls on the people of the world to unite more closely and launch a prolonged and fierce attack on U.S. imperialism and its accomplices. We will definitely respond to Chairman Mao's great call, launch a fierce anti-U.S. patriotic struggle, and drive U.S. imperialism out of Japan.

    日本各界人民欢呼毛主席伟大声明指出世界人民前进方向
    响应毛主席号召展开持久猛烈的反美斗争
    新华社十八日讯　据东方通讯社报道：日本各界人民热烈赞扬伟大领袖毛主席支持美国黑人抗暴斗争的声明具有伟大的意义。他们指出，这个声明不仅极大地鼓舞美国黑人的斗争，而且给世界各国人民的解放斗争指明前进的方向。
    亚非人民团结日本委员会理事长坂本德松说：“毛主席的声明不仅鼓舞着美国黑人的斗争，而且也使全世界的工人、农民、革命知识分子以及所有反对美帝国主义的人们从中获得了勇气，看到了光辉的前景。”
    坂本说：我们要遵照毛主席的“世界革命进入了一个伟大的新时代”的英明指示立即行动起来，给美国黑人斗争以强有力的声援。我们要紧密地团结起来，对准美帝和日本反动派，展开持久的猛烈的进攻。
    坂本说：广大日本人民正在努力学习伟大的毛泽东思想，并把毛泽东思想看作是进行斗争的强有力的武器。
    东京山谷贫民窟的居民代表梶大介说：毛主席的声明清楚地指明了全世界人民前进的方向。有毛主席领导着我们，这是全世界人民最大的幸福。
    梶大介赞扬美国黑人的英勇斗争，极大地支援了越南人民的抗美救国战争和世界人民的革命斗争。
    梶大介表示坚决响应毛主席的号召，将更加有力地展开反对美帝国主义的斗争。
    梶大介引用了毛主席关于帝国主义和一切反动派都是纸老虎的论断，并指出，毛主席的这个论断是非常正确的。他说，所有的反动派都是一方面疯狂地镇压人民，另方面用什么“自由”“和平”等词句来欺骗人民。但是，现在越来越多的人已经识破了它们的真面目，不再受骗了。我们一定要揭穿反动派的谎言，用革命的暴力来反击它们反革命的暴力。
    东京三多摩地区的青年工人斋藤裕志说：“毛主席指出的‘当前，世界革命进入了一个伟大的新时代’的教导，是关于当前世界革命形势的最正确的论断。毛主席呼吁‘全世界人民更紧密地团结起来，向着我们的共同敌人美帝国主义及其帮凶们发动持久的猛烈的进攻！’这是对世界革命人民最强有力的号召。”
    革命学生左山忠说：“毛主席的声明，是鼓舞美国黑人和美国白人中的广大劳动人民进行斗争的武器，是全世界被压迫民族和被压迫人民的进军号。这个声明使站在日本反美爱国斗争前列的青年、学生增加了勇气。”
    他说：“美帝国主义已经陷于进退维谷的境地。毛主席教导我们：‘全世界人民要有勇气，敢于战斗，不怕困难，前赴后继，那末，全世界就一定是人民的。’目前的大好形势证明，毛主席的这个教导是完全正确的。”
    左山说：毛主席号召全世界人民更紧密地团结起来，向美帝国主义及其帮凶们发动持久的猛烈的进攻。我们一定响应毛主席的伟大号召，发动猛烈的反美爱国斗争，把美帝从日本赶出去。
