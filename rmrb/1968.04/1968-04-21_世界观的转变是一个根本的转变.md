The great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "A fundamental change in worldview is a fundamental change." Only by taking Mao Zedong Thought as our weapon, transforming our thinking, and undergoing long-term tempering in revolutionary struggle, can we constantly eliminate bourgeois ideology and establish proletarian ideology, thereby becoming steadfast proletarian revolutionaries.

However, China's Khrushchev blathers on about: "A change in stance, for an individual, is not too difficult. A Communist Party member turning traitor to the revolution is just as easy. A Communist Party member—a proletarian warrior—can instantly change sides, and so can people from other classes." Here, China's Khrushchev completely denies the necessity and arduousness of transforming one's worldview, and denies the fundamental difference between the proletarian worldview and the bourgeois worldview. He treats changing one's stance as if it were a magic trick, instantly changing sides and then instantly changing back; transforming one's worldview is as easy as changing hats. We must shout loudly: China's Khrushchev, you are slandering our Communist Party members the most, this is a thoroughly traitorous philosophy!

The great leader Chairman Mao repeatedly teaches us: "A thorough change in worldview requires a very long time," and must "undergo long-term, even painful, tempering." The soldiers and workers of the 1124 Construction Site have deeply felt from personal experience that Chairman Mao's teachings are absolutely true. The emergence of the 1124 Construction Site rescue team was not something that appeared out of thin air. The Communist Party members in this team did not instantly become steadfast proletarian warriors. We comrades have come to understand from practice: due to the existence of exploiting classes in the world, the tenacity of bourgeois ideology in people's minds determines the long-term and arduous nature of the struggle to eliminate bourgeois ideology and establish proletarian ideology. Therefore, we have always regarded transforming our worldview as the most arduous and important battle task, and like the beating of a heart, we never stop using Chairman Mao's teaching of "completely and thoroughly serving the people" as the standard to measure ourselves every day; using Chairman Mao's teaching of "extreme responsibility towards work, extreme enthusiasm towards comrades and the people" as a mirror to examine ourselves every day; with the thorough revolutionary spirit of the Foolish Old Man Moving Mountains, we fight against the "self" in our minds every day. It is precisely because we usually use Mao Zedong Thought as our weapon and have worked hard on transforming our worldview that when serious dangers arose during construction, we could, with the spirit of communism that "only the sacrifice of a few can bring happiness to the many," rush towards the danger, trample over difficulties, and remain unshakable under the pressure of Mount Tai, thereby winning the victory in the rescue struggle. Our experience is: only by fighting against selfishness and revisionism in every second can we selflessly dedicate ourselves in the crucial moment.

"Transforming one's worldview is a fundamental change." Once one truly establishes a proletarian worldview, one will inevitably be infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao, infinitely loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, and infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. During the rescue, although the danger zone was raining with falling rocks and entering it at any moment could result in being crushed to death, every comrade was filled with infinite loyalty to Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong Thought, knowing the danger was great but rushing towards the danger zone. There was absolutely no question of instantly changing sides and becoming a cowardly deserter in the face of danger.

In the face of severe tests, there are those who crawl out of the enemy's doghole, bowing and scraping, and surrendering to the enemy. Among the handful of counter-revolutionary revisionists led by China's Khrushchev, many have crawled out of the enemy's doghole. For them, there is no question of "instantly changing sides," but rather they have never changed in the first place. China's Khrushchev, with the stance of a landlord and bourgeois, infiltrated the Party and for decades never changed his original stance, committing heinous crimes against the Party and the people. As soon as the War of Resistance Against Japan ended, he drooled over the idea of becoming an official in the Kuomintang government; as soon as the country was liberated, he eagerly curried favor with big capitalists, singing the praises of "exploitation is beneficial." Once the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution began, he fiercely suppressed the proletarian revolutionary faction. All of this—was it "instantly changing sides"? No! He is a stubborn reactionary, merely adding some disguises as the revolutionary struggle deepens.

Of course, those born into exploiting classes can also become Communist Party members. However, it is not like China's Khrushchev's magic trick of "instantly changing sides," but rather, as Chairman Mao teaches, one must "undergo long-term, even painful, tempering" and be reborn.

China's Khrushchev spreads this set of reactionary fallacies with the evil purpose of not allowing Communist Party members to transform their worldview, allowing bourgeois ideology to freely spread within the Party, and wanting to use bourgeois ideology to transform our Party; at the same time, opening the green light for recruiting traitors, allowing landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists, traitors, and spies to infiltrate the Party. Ultimately, it is to turn the Party into a tool for his restoration of capitalism, achieving the evil purpose of restoring capitalism.

We are proletarian revolutionaries armed with Mao Zedong Thought. We must stand in direct opposition to China's Khrushchev, actively learn and apply Chairman Mao's works, and work hard on transforming our worldview; we must drive out the traitors, spies, and unrepentant capitalist-roaders who have infiltrated the Party, making our Party truly, as Chairman Mao teaches, a vanguard organization composed of advanced elements of the proletariat, capable of leading the proletariat and revolutionary masses in fighting against class enemies, full of vigor and vitality.

    世界观的转变是一个根本的转变
    一一二四工地抢险集体
    伟大领袖毛主席教导我们：“世界观的转变是一个根本的转变”。我们每个同志只有以毛泽东思想为武器，改造自己的思想，在革命斗争中经过长期的锻炼，不断灭资兴无，破私立公，才能树立无产阶级世界观，成为坚强的无产阶级革命战士。
    可是中国赫鲁晓夫却胡说什么：“立场的转变，对个人来说，不是太困难的，一个共产党员叛变革命也一样不困难，……一个共产党员——无产阶级的战士一下子可以变过去，其他阶级的人当然也可以一下子变过来。”在这里，中国赫鲁晓夫完全否定了世界观改造的必要性和艰巨性，否定了无产阶级世界观同资产阶级世界观的本质区别。他把立场的转变当成变戏法一样，可以一下子变过去，一下子又变过来；转变世界观简直象换帽子那样容易。我们要大喝一声：中国赫鲁晓夫，你这是对我们共产党员最大的污蔑，是彻头彻尾的叛徒哲学！
    伟大领袖毛主席一再教导我们：“世界观的彻底改变需要一个很长的时间”，要“经过长期的甚至是痛苦的磨练。”我们一一二四工地的指战员，从切身经历中深刻地感到毛主席的这些教导是千真万确的真理。一一二四工地抢险集体的出现，绝不是一下子凭空变出来的，我们这个集体中的共产党员绝不是一下子变成坚强的无产阶级战士的。我们这些同志，从实践中认识到：由于世界上有剥削阶级存在，人们头脑中资产阶级思想的顽固性，决定了灭资兴无斗争的持久性、艰巨性。所以，我们始终把改造世界观当作最艰巨、最重要的战斗任务，要象心脏跳动一样，永不停息地以毛主席的“完全”、“彻底”为人民服务的教导作标准，天天衡量；以毛主席的“对工作的极端的负责任，对同志对人民的极端的热忱”的教导为镜子，天天对照；以愚公移山的彻底革命精神，天天同头脑中的“私”字斗。正是因为平日我们用毛泽东思想为武器，在改造世界观上狠下了功夫，所以当施工中出现严重险情时，我们就能以“只有少数人的牺牲，才能换来多数人的幸福”的共产主义精神，迎着险情上，踩着困难冲，泰山压顶不动摇，夺取了抢险斗争的胜利。我们的体会是：只有平时千万个一秒钟内斗私批修，才能在关键的一秒钟内为公献身。
      “世界观的转变是一个根本的转变”。只要是真正确立了无产阶级世界观，必然是无限忠于毛主席，无限忠于毛泽东思想，无限忠于毛主席的革命路线。我们在抢险时，尽管险区内落石如雨，冲进去随时都有被砸死的危险，可是同志们个个都是怀着对毛主席和毛泽东思想的无限忠诚，明知险情大，偏向险区冲。根本就不存在危险时刻“一下子变过去”、当可耻逃兵的问题。
    在严峻的考验面前，卑躬屈膝地从敌人的狗洞里爬出来，投降敌人的人是有的。以中国赫鲁晓夫为首的一小撮反革命修正主义分子，其中有很多人就是从敌人的狗洞里爬出来的。对他们来说，不存在“一下子变过去”的问题，而是他们压根儿就没有变过来。中国赫鲁晓夫带着地主资产阶级立场钻进党内后，几十年来根本没有改变原来的立场，对党对人民犯下滔天罪行。抗日战争刚结束，他就垂涎三尺，想到国民党政府里去做官；全国刚解放，他就迫不及待地靠上大资本家，歌颂“剥削有功”。无产阶级文化大革命开始了，他就疯狂镇压无产阶级革命派。所有这些，是他“一下子变过去”的吗？否！他是个顽固不化的反动家伙，只不过随着革命斗争的深入，有时增添一些伪装罢了。
    当然，出身剥削阶级家庭的人也是可以成为共产党员的。但是，决不是象中国赫鲁晓夫的变戏法那样一下子“变过来”的，而是要按毛主席的教导，“经过长期的甚至是痛苦的磨练”，脱胎换骨才行。
    中国赫鲁晓夫散布这一套反动谬论的罪恶目的，就是不让共产党员改造世界观，让资产阶级思想在党内自由泛滥，就是想用资产阶级思想改造我们的党；同时为他招降纳叛开绿灯，好让地富反坏右分子、叛徒、特务钻进党内来。归根到底，就是想把党变成他复辟资本主义的工具，达到复辟资本主义的罪恶目的。
    我们是毛泽东思想武装起来的无产阶级革命战士，我们就是要同中国赫鲁晓夫针锋相对，就是要活学活用毛主席著作，在改造世界观上狠下功夫；就是要把钻进党内的叛徒、特务、顽固不化的走资派清除出去，使我们党真正象毛主席所教导的那样，是无产阶级先进分子所组成，能够领导无产阶级和革命群众对于阶级敌人进行战斗的朝气蓬勃的先锋队组织。
