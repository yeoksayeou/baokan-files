The Revolutionary Committee of Guiyang Steel Plant is intensifying class struggle and carrying out revolutionary criticism. Revolutionary masses are full of vigor, and the achievements in production struggle are remarkable. They have carried forward the spirit of self-reliance and built a heating furnace in a relatively short time. At the same time, they have thoroughly dug out the potential for savings, resulting in a doubling of steel production and improved quality.

Xinhua News Agency, Guiyang, April 28th: The Revolutionary Committee of Guiyang Steel Plant is intensifying class struggle and carrying out revolutionary criticism. They have thoroughly eliminated the poison of counter-revolutionary revisionism spread by the Chinese Khrushchev and a handful of capitalist roaders within the party in industrial and mining enterprises. The revolutionary masses are full of vigor and are producing steel in large quantities, which is urgently needed by the coal industry and other departments. In the first quarter of this year, the production of this type of steel has increased several times compared to the same period last year, and the quality has significantly improved.

The class struggle in this factory is very sharp. In the past, a handful of capitalist roaders within the party implemented the Khrushchev revisionist industrial line in this factory, and the poison was deep and the harm was great. After the Revolutionary Committee of this factory was established in June last year, a handful of traitors, spies, and unrepentant capitalist roaders deceived a part of the masses and fiercely opposed the newly born Revolutionary Committee, disrupting the revolution and production. Faced with the serious class struggle, the Revolutionary Committee of Guiyang Steel Plant led the revolutionary masses of the entire factory to resolutely fight against the enemies of the proletariat, exposing the enemies' plots to sabotage the revolution and production; at the same time, they mobilized everyone to take actual actions to respond to the great call of Chairman Mao, "Grasp revolution, promote production," ensuring that production does not stop for a single day. The broad masses of revolutionary cadres and workers of the proletariat repeatedly studied Chairman Mao's teachings: "This army has an indomitable spirit; it will trample all enemies underfoot and will never be subdued by the enemy. No matter how difficult and painful the situation is, as long as there is one person, this person must continue to fight." They used this great, fearless revolutionary spirit of the proletariat to guard their posts every day, intensify the revolution, and vigorously promote production, with steel production continuously increasing.

The sixteen articles personally drafted by Chairman Mao point out: The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is to make people's thinking revolutionary, thereby making all work done better, faster, more, and more economical. As long as the masses are fully mobilized and properly arranged, it is possible to guarantee that cultural revolution and production will not be neglected, and to guarantee the high quality of all work. The facts of Guiyang Steel Plant fully prove that Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee's great judgment is extremely wise and correct. The rolling mill workshop of this factory originally used two rolling mills to produce steel in a continuous rolling process. Since one of the rolling mills also undertook the task of opening billets, the steel production was very low. To increase production, it was necessary to change the continuous rolling process of the two rolling mills and fully utilize the efficiency of the rolling mills. To change this process, it was necessary to build an additional billet heating furnace. In the past, a handful of capitalist roaders within the factory had also built a heating furnace. They had dispatched a large number of technical personnel to visit many metallurgical factories across the country, resulting in the expenditure of more than twenty million yuan in construction costs, but the furnace built could not be used. It stood in the workshop, becoming an iron evidence of the "technical leadership" and "expert management" of the revisionist line implemented by the Chinese Khrushchev and a handful of capitalist roaders within the party. During the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the broad revolutionary masses resolutely implemented Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, thoroughly changing the backward production situation caused by the counter-revolutionary revisionist industrial line. The Revolutionary Committee decided to rely on the masses, carry forward the spirit of self-reliance, and build another heating furnace. They formed a "three-in-one" design team consisting of workers with the most production experience, technical personnel who deeply understand the actual situation, and revolutionary cadres, and designed on-site. When encountering problems, they consulted with the workers, thus making a relatively good design. The construction of the heating furnace lacked materials, but the factory Revolutionary Committee mobilized the masses to use old and scrap materials to solve this problem. They spent only more than twenty thousand yuan and built a heating furnace in a relatively short time, increasing steel production by more than one-fold. Two lines, two results. This vivid fact deeply educated the revolutionary workers, further arousing their deep feelings of loyalty to Chairman Mao, loyalty to Mao Zedong Thought, and loyalty to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "To make our country prosperous and strong, it will take decades of hard struggle, including the implementation of the policy of thrift and opposition to waste in the construction of the country." The Revolutionary Committee of Guiyang Steel Plant and the broad revolutionary masses resolutely implement this great policy. At one period, due to transportation difficulties and lack of raw materials, the entire factory's revolutionary workers thoroughly dug out the potential for savings and increased steel production. In the past, a handful of capitalist roaders within the party regarded the country's wealth as dirt and discarded tens of thousands of tons of scrap steel, inferior steel, and broken coal. These scrap steel and broken coal were piled up like mountains. The workers called them the "steel mountain" and "coal mountain." This again became evidence of the crimes of the capitalist roaders within the party against Chairman Mao's policy of thrift in national construction. The Revolutionary Committee led the revolutionary workers of the entire factory to criticize the heinous crimes of a handful of capitalist roaders within the party in opposing Chairman Mao's policy of thrift in national construction and other aspects in front of the "steel mountain" and "coal mountain." Through revolutionary criticism, Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line was further deeply rooted in people's hearts, and the class consciousness and line struggle consciousness of the broad revolutionary workers were further improved. The entire factory launched a massive, people's movement of thrift. In the past half year, just the scrap steel and broken coal dug out from the ground amounted to nearly two thousand tons each. The workers proudly said: "What we dug out is not just scrap steel and broken coal, we dug out the revolutionary spirit of thrift and economy buried by the capitalist roaders within the party!" In the past, a handful of capitalist roaders within the party did not rely on the masses, detached from production practice, and believed that a type of pig iron produced in Sichuan could not be made into good steel. The factory had accumulated a large amount of this type of pig iron. Now, the revolutionary workers carry forward the revolutionary spirit of daring to think, daring to do, and daring to practice, breaking the old technological framework, and adopting new technology, finally making good steel.

At present, the revolutionary and production situation in this factory is excellent and getting better and better.

    贵阳钢铁厂革委会狠抓阶级斗争开展革命大批判
    革命群众意气风发　生产斗争成绩显著
    发扬自力更生的革命精神，在较短时间内建成一座加热炉，同时狠挖节约潜力，钢材产量倍增，质量提高
    新华社贵阳二十八日电　贵阳钢铁厂革命委员会狠抓阶级斗争，开展革命大批判，彻底肃清中国赫鲁晓夫等党内一小撮走资派在工矿企业中散布的反革命修正主义流毒，革命群众意气风发，大力增产煤炭工业等部门急需的钢材。今年第一季度，这种钢材的产量比去年同期成倍增长，质量显著提高。
    这个工厂的阶级斗争是十分尖锐的。过去，党内一小撮走资派在这个厂推行中国赫鲁晓夫修正主义工业路线，流毒极深，危害很大。去年六月，这个厂的革命委员会建立以后，一小撮叛徒、特务、顽固不化的走资派，蒙蔽一部分群众，猖狂地反对新诞生的革命委员会，破坏革命和生产。在严重的阶级斗争面前，贵阳钢铁厂革命委员会领导全厂革命群众，和无产阶级的敌人进行了坚决的斗争，揭露敌人妄图破坏革命和生产的阴谋；同时，动员大家以实际行动，响应伟大领袖毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的伟大号召，保证生产一天不停。广大无产阶级革命派和革命职工，反复学习毛主席的教导：“这个军队具有一往无前的精神，它要压倒一切敌人，而决不被敌人所屈服。不论在任何艰难困苦的场合，只要还有一个人，这个人就要继续战斗下去。”他们用这种无产阶级的大无畏革命精神，天天坚守岗位，狠抓革命，猛促生产，钢材产量不断增长。
    毛主席亲自主持制定的十六条指出：无产阶级文化大革命，就是为的要使人的思想革命化，因而使各项工作做得更多、更快、更好、更省。只要充分发动群众，妥善安排，就能够保证文化革命和生产两不悮，保证各项工作的高质量。贵阳钢铁厂的事实，充分证明了毛主席和党中央这一伟大论断无比英明、正确。这个厂的轧钢车间，原来两部轧钢机采取连续轧钢的工艺进行生产。由于其中一部轧钢机还担负着开坯任务，所以钢材产量很低。要增产，就要改变两部轧钢机连续轧钢的工艺，充分发挥轧钢机的效能。而要改变这种工艺，就需要增建一个钢坯加热炉。过去，厂内一小撮走资派，也建设过加热炉。他们曾抽调大批技术人员，到全国各地参观了很多冶金工厂，结果，花了二十多万元的建设费用，建起来的炉子却不能使用。它摆在车间，成了中国赫鲁晓夫等党内一小撮走资派推行修正主义的“技术挂帅”、“专家办厂”的铁的罪证。在无产阶级文化大革命中，广大革命职工坚决贯彻执行毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，彻底改变反革命修正主义工业路线所造成的生产落后局面。革委会决定依靠群众，发扬自力更生的革命精神，另建一座加热炉。他们由最有生产实践经验的工人和深入实际的技术人员、革命干部组成“三结合”设计组，在现场进行设计，遇到问题就和工人商量，因此做出了比较好的设计。建设加热炉缺少材料，但是，厂革委会发动群众，利用旧料和废料，解决了这个问题。他们只花了两万多元，就在比较短的时间内建成了一座加热炉，使钢材的产量提高了一倍多。两条路线，两种结果。这一生动的事实，深深教育了革命职工，更加激发了他们无限忠于毛主席、无限忠于毛泽东思想、无限忠于毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的深厚感情。
    毛主席教导我们：“要使我国富强起来，需要几十年艰苦奋斗的时间，其中包括执行厉行节约、反对浪费这样一个勤俭建国的方针。”贵阳钢铁厂革命委员会和广大革命群众，坚决贯彻执行这一伟大方针。这个厂有一个时期，由于运输困难，原料缺乏。在这种情况下，全厂的革命职工狠挖节约潜力，增产钢材。过去，党内一小撮走资派把国家财富视如粪土，扔掉了上万吨废钢、次钢和碎煤。这些废钢、碎煤堆积如山。工人们称之为“钢巴山”“煤巴山”。这又成了党内走资派反对毛主席勤俭建国方针的罪证。革委会就领导全厂革命职工在“钢巴山”、“煤巴山”前面，批判党内一小撮走资派反对毛主席的勤俭建国方针等方面的滔天罪行。通过革命大批判，毛主席的无产阶级革命路线更加深入人心，广大革命职工阶级觉悟和路线斗争觉悟进一步提高。全厂展开了声势浩大的、群众性的节约活动。半年来，只是从地下挖出来的废钢铁就将近二千吨，碎煤二千吨。工人们自豪地说：“我们挖出的不只是废钢铁、碎煤块，我们挖出的是被党内走资派埋掉的勤俭节约的革命精神！”过去，党内一小撮走资派不依靠群众，脱离生产实践，认为四川出产的一种生铁炼不出好钢，厂里积存了大量的这种生铁。现在，革命职工发扬敢想、敢干、勇于实践的革命精神，打破旧的工艺框框，采用新工艺，终于炼出了好钢。
    目前，这个厂的革命、生产形势一片大好，越来越好。
