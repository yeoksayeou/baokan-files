The modern revisionist traitor clique in the Soviet Union is continuing to provide new weapons to the Indian reactionaries. The collusion between the Soviet revisionists and the Indian reactionaries has been particularly rampant in the naval sphere.

According to a report by the Pakistani newspaper *Dawn* on March 29, the Indian and Soviet governments signed an agreement at the end of February, stipulating that the Soviet government would provide the Indian government with at least twenty-five MiG-21 jet fighters, shells for 130mm cannons, and mines for submarines.

*Dawn* also reported that the total number of Su-17 fighter-bombers that the Indian government has received from the Soviet government will not be one hundred but at least one hundred seventy.

*Dawn* reported on March 31 that the Indian government is negotiating with the Soviet government to purchase Tu-16 bombers that can carry nuclear warheads.

Soviet Pacific Fleet Commander Amelko arrived in New Delhi on March 31 for activities, and he will hold secret talks with high-level officials of the Indian reactionary government. Three warships from the fleet he leads have completed their activities in the Indian port of Madras and are now heading to Bombay.

Before this fleet arrived in India, Soviet Deputy Minister of Defense and Navy Commander Gorishkov led a naval delegation to India in February. He secretly discussed with the Indian reactionary government the issue of further tightening counter-revolutionary collusion in the naval sphere.

According to Indian newspapers, after Gorishkov left India, the Soviet revisionists and the Indian reactionaries continued to secretly negotiate the issue of Soviet naval vessels docking, repairing, and refueling in Indian ports, essentially providing naval bases to the Soviet revisionists. It is revealed that the two sides may sign a treaty on this dirty deal.

The recent tightening of military collusion between the Soviet revisionists and the Indian reactionaries is in coordination with the U.S. imperialists' efforts to form a new anti-China, anti-communist, and anti-people military alliance in the Southeast Asian region. These conspiratorial activities are not only directed against China but also against the peoples of Asian countries. They have been severely exposed and condemned by the peoples of Asia and the world.

According to a report by the Pakistan News Agency on March 30, West Pakistan Governor Muhammad Musa said in a speech at a gathering in Karachi on March 29 that Pakistan is fully aware of India's large-scale military buildup. Pakistan will not neglect its defense needs, and the Pakistani armed forces, supported by the people, are fully capable of defending every inch of the motherland.

Musa, in discussing the Kashmir issue, stated that the Pakistani government and people will firmly fulfill their obligations to support the Kashmiri people in their struggle for the right to self-determination.

According to a report by the *Pakistan Times* on March 30, two months ago, during Soviet leader Kosygin's visit to India, a new military "aid" agreement was signed, with the Soviet revisionists agreeing to help India expand its navy. The Soviet revisionists have agreed to provide India with six submarines, five frigates, four landing ships, and more than ten patrol boats. The military equipment provided by the Soviet Union to India is paid for in Indian rupees, but in reality, a large part of it is indirectly paid for by the United States.

The newspaper stated that the Soviet Union's assistance in expanding India's navy will promote the ambitions of Indian expansionists to control the Indian Ocean. The Soviet aid will also be used to target India's neighboring countries, particularly Pakistan.

    新华社一日讯　苏联现代修正主义叛徒集团正在继续向印度反动派提供新式武器。苏修和印度反动派最近在海军方面的勾结特别猖獗。
    据巴基斯坦《黎明报》三月二十九日报道，印度和苏联政府在将近二月底的时候签订了一项协定，它规定苏联政府向印度政府提供至少二十五架米格—21型喷气战斗机、一百三十毫米大炮用的炮弹和潜水艇敷设的水雷。
    《黎明报》还报道，印度政府从苏联政府得到的苏—17型战斗轰炸机的总数将不是一百架而是至少一百七十架。
    《黎明报》三月三十一日报道，印度政府正在同苏联政府谈判，要求从苏联购买可以运载核弹的图—16型轰炸机。
    苏修太平洋舰队司令阿梅尔科三月三十一日到新德里活动，他将同印度反动政府的高级官员举行密谈。他率领的舰队中的三艘军舰已经到印度的马德拉斯港活动完毕并且正在驶往孟买。
    在这支舰队到印度活动之前，苏修国防部副部长、海军总司令戈尔什科夫曾经在二月间率领一个海军代表团到印度活动，他同印度反动政府密商了双方在海军方面加紧进行反革命勾结的问题。
    据印度报纸透露，在戈尔什科夫离开印度之后，苏修和印度反动派继续秘密协商关于苏修海军舰只在印度港口停泊、修理和加油的问题，实际上是印度反动派向苏修提供海军基地。据透露，双方可能就这桩肮脏的交易签署一项条约。
    苏修和印度反动派最近这些加紧军事勾结的活动，是同美帝国主义极力在东南亚地区拼凑新的反华、反共、反人民的军事联盟的活动互相配合的。这些阴谋活动，不仅是针对中国的，而且也是针对亚洲各国人民的。它受到亚洲和世界人民的严正揭露和谴责。
    新华社拉瓦尔品第三十日电　据巴基斯坦联合通讯社报道，西巴基斯坦省督穆罕默德·穆萨三月二十九日在卡拉奇的一次集会上讲话时说，巴基斯坦充分注视着印度在大规模地扩充军备。巴基斯坦不会忽视自己的防务需要，受到人民支持的巴基斯坦武装力量完全能够保卫祖国的每一寸土地。
    穆萨在谈到克什米尔问题时表示，巴基斯坦政府和人民将坚定地承担自己的义务，支持克什米尔人民获得民族自决权利。
    据《巴基斯坦时报》三十日报道，两个月前苏修头目柯西金到印度活动期间，签订了一项新的军事“援助”协定，苏修答应帮助印度扩充海军。苏修已经同意向印度提供六艘潜水艇、五艘护卫舰、四艘登陆艇以及十余艘巡逻艇。苏修向印度提供的军事装备，印度是以印度卢比付款的，而实际上很大部分是由美国间接支付的。
    报纸说，苏联帮助扩充印度海军，将促使印度扩张主义者实现其控制印度洋的野心，苏联的援助还将被用来对付印度的邻国，特别是对付巴基斯坦。
