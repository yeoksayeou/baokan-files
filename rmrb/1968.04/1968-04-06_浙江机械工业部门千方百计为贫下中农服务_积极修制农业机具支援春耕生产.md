The revolutionary workers in the mechanical industry department of Zhejiang Province are actively repairing and manufacturing various agricultural machinery to support spring farming. At present, the province has repaired over 20,000 pieces of spring farming machinery, which have been warmly welcomed by the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants. In the process of repairing agricultural machinery, they have spared no effort to save materials and spare parts, thus reducing the burden on the collective economy of the rural people's communes.
