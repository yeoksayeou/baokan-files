Our company is stationed in the remote border region of the Nujiang River in southwest China. Between this region and the interior of the country lie two major rivers and mountains over 5,000 meters high, such as the Gaoligong Mountains and the Biluo Snow Mountains. Every year from December to the following June, the snow on the mountain tops can reach depths of over ten meters, completely cutting off all transportation. Even during the snowmelt season, there is only a narrow path that can be traversed.

The people's warriors are infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao. Although we are separated from Beijing by thousands of mountains and rivers, our comrades' hearts are all turned towards Beijing, closely following the great leader Chairman Mao. Snow can block the mountains, but it cannot block our infinite love for Chairman Mao, our enthusiasm for studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought, or our resolute hearts in carrying out Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. For seven or eight years, we have read Chairman Mao's works every day, listened to the voices from Beijing from the proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao, and followed the great strategic deployments of the great commander Chairman Mao. The direction of the struggle of the people of the entire country is our direction of struggle. We firmly grasp the struggle between the two classes, the two roads, and the two lines, make a big fuss about the revolution, and together with the Dulong people, advance along the socialist direction and the proletarian revolutionary line pointed out by Chairman Mao, towards victory.

Closely following Chairman Mao's great strategic deployments, cutting off the black hands of the Chinese Khrushchev reaching into the Nujiang River

On February 20, 1967, the Party Central Committee issued a letter to the poor and lower-middle peasants and cadres at all levels in the countryside nationwide, calling on the People's Liberation Army to actively help the masses with spring farming production. We heard this letter on the radio, and the Party branch immediately conducted a study. At that time, it was still the period of heavy snowfall on the mountains, and the specific arrangements from higher authorities had not yet been conveyed. Should we wait for the instructions from higher authorities, or should we take immediate action? The Party branch believed: The voice of the proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao is a command. When Chairman Mao gives the order, the border guards must act swiftly and bravely!

The Nujiang River region is the fourth district of Gongshan Dulong and Nu Autonomous County in Yunnan, consisting of four townships. In the past, our work focus was always on these four townships. Those days, everyone heard from the radio that the "January Revolution" storm swept across the country, and the revolutionary masses were engaged in fierce struggles with the handful of capitalist roaders within the Party for power. The class enemies were vigorously promoting economism, attempting to disrupt production to disrupt the revolution. The Party branch analyzed this situation and believed that at this critical moment, Chairman Mao called on us to "grasp the revolution and promote production." We must carry out this call without any compromise. The Party branch decided: The entire company must step forward and push our work from the four townships to the entire Nujiang River region, mobilizing the masses to take on the heavy responsibilities of revolution and production throughout the district. Therefore, we organized most of the comrades in the company into thirteen Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams and sent them out to the 300-mile-long Nujiang River region.

The Nujiang River region is vast and sparsely populated. The further we went, the narrower the path became, until there was no path at all. The fewer people there were, the fewer households there were, sometimes only two or three households constituted a "large village." It was already the busy spring planting season, but there were still very few people working in the fields. Seeing this situation, many comrades were very anxious. To understand the situation, we conducted investigations among the masses. During the investigations, we discovered: The "theory of the extinction of class struggle" propagated by the Chinese Khrushchev, as well as his entire set of counter-revolutionary revisionist lines, had a deep influence in this region. The handful of capitalist roaders within the Party at the provincial, prefectural, state, and county levels openly put forward the reactionary slogan of "long-term inviolability of private ownership," advocating that "class differentiation and class struggle are not obvious in the Nujiang River region." Although seventeen years had passed since liberation, some reactionary local chiefs and slave owners were still cruelly oppressing and exploiting the people. Hearing these situations, everyone was filled with indignation, deeply feeling that class struggle here was extremely sharp. Aiming at the living class struggle reality, the Party branch organized everyone to study Chairman Mao's teachings on class struggle. Chairman Mao said: "Class struggle is an objective existence, not subject to the will of man." Grasping the revolution is to grasp class struggle. Whether or not to grasp class struggle is the focal point of the struggle between the two lines in border construction. In the past, the handful of capitalist roaders within the Party, represented by the Chinese Khrushchev, had vigorously propagated the "theory of the extinction of class struggle," obscuring the serious existence of class struggle, and attempting to let the reactionary local chiefs and slave owners continue to ride on the heads of the people and enjoy themselves. Everyone angrily said: "The Communist Party is about class struggle, and the People's Liberation Army is about liberating the people. We must definitely hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, smash the system of exploitation to pieces, and thoroughly cut off the black hands of the Chinese Khrushchev reaching into the Nujiang River region!"

Under the leadership of the Party branch, all the comrades in the company went deep into every household, eating, living, and working with the masses, extensively propagating the great significance of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and organizing the masses to study Chairman Mao's teachings on class struggle. Chairman Mao said: "National struggle, in the final analysis, is a class struggle problem." "The people rely on us to organize. The reactionaries in China rely on us to organize the people to overthrow them. All reactionary things, if you do not attack, they will not fall." Chairman Mao's words flowed into the hearts of the masses like spring water. Every night, the masses studied and sang, learned until late into the night and still did not want to leave.

The great Mao Zedong Thought armed the broad masses of the Nujiang River region, and the flames of class struggle burned more fiercely. From the first township to the fourth township, the entire Nujiang River region boiled over, and everywhere was a settlement of accounts with the reactionary local chiefs and slave owners. The laboring masses were overjoyed, with raised eyebrows and open mouths. The masses enthusiastically cheered for the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution led by Chairman Mao: "A thousand good things, ten thousand good things, a thousand-year-old snow melted, ten thousand clouds and mists dispersed, the red sun truly rose!" At the meeting, Ba Bi, a female slave who had just been liberated, wearing a new set of clothes given to her by the army, looked at the badge of Chairman Mao on her chest, raised high the red "Quotations from Chairman Mao," and shouted, "Long live Chairman Mao!" She was extremely excited and said with tears streaming down her face: "It is Chairman Mao who liberated me, and it is the Cultural Revolution that liberated me. The brightest star is the North Star, and the greatest benefactor is Chairman Mao. I will follow Chairman Mao to make revolution for life, overthrow the Chinese Khrushchev, and annihilate all the wolves that eat people!"

The reality of class struggle educated the masses, and the class consciousness of the broad masses was greatly enhanced. They said: "The most poisonous snake has poisonous fangs, the most poisonous grass has poisonous roots, the Dulong people are poor and have black lines, if we do not uproot the black lines, we will still be slaves." They said: "'Never forget class struggle' is the teaching of the great leader Chairman Mao. We must always remember class struggle, continue to struggle, struggle until all class enemies are annihilated, and struggle for a bright red world of Mao Zedong Thought!"

With the heavy stone lifted from the heads of the masses, spring farming production was carried out with great enthusiasm. The broad masses overcame various difficulties, carried out large-scale agricultural land construction, opened up layer upon layer of terraces, and expanded the cultivated land area by one-third compared to before. This is the great victory of Mao Zedong Thought, the great victory of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line.

Vigorously carry out the great criticism, planting the red flag of socialism throughout the Nujiang River valley

Last April, the revolutionary masses and revolutionary cadres across the country launched a fierce attack on the Chinese Khrushchev, carrying out a magnificent struggle of great criticism. The Party branch immediately analyzed this situation, organized all the comrades in the company to repeatedly listen to related articles and news, and discuss how to follow Chairman Mao's strategic deployments and carry out revolutionary great criticism in the Nujiang River valley, further carrying out the struggle between the two lines.

The essence of the struggle between the two lines is whether to build socialism or capitalism. During the three years of difficulty, the Chinese Khrushchev viciously attacked the Three Red Banners and promoted the revisionist line of "three selfs and one contract," causing us in the Nujiang River region to suffer greatly. As soon as this issue was mentioned, everyone was filled with indignation, unable to forget the struggles we had carried out in the Nujiang River region in the past few years.

Our company, since entering this snowy valley in 1961, has been determined to hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and lead the Dulong people to walk the socialist road. In 1961, we established the first cooperative in Makou Village. In the first year of establishing the cooperative, the superiority of socialist collective production was fully demonstrated, and the enthusiasm of the members for socialist labor reached an unprecedented height, achieving a bumper harvest. However, by the end of 1962, the year when the Makou Cooperative had achieved two consecutive bumper harvests, a certain minister came from above. This person, as soon as he arrived, before his buttocks were even warm, began to spout nonsense, saying that the Nujiang River region was "backward" and that the "people had no consciousness," and according to the instructions from higher authorities, the private ownership in the border areas must remain unchanged for a long time, insisting on dismantling this cooperative. Chairman Mao said: "Here it seems to be only a difference of one word, one wants to dismount and the other wants to mount, but it reflects the divergence of two lines." Based on Chairman Mao's teachings, the masses called this minister and the reactionary local chiefs and slave owners who supported this minister the "dismount faction," and called our company and the revolutionary masses the "mount faction." A great debate took place between the "dismount faction" and the "mount faction."

The "dismount faction" said: "The Nujiang River region is backward, and it was still slash-and-burn agriculture before liberation, so it cannot establish a cooperative."

The "mount faction" said: "Precisely because it is backward, it is even more necessary to establish a cooperative. Chairman Mao said: 'Apart from socialism, there is no other way.' 'The vast majority of peasants in the country, in order to get rid of poverty, improve their lives, and resist disasters, have no other way but to unite and advance towards the socialist road to achieve their goals.' After we established the cooperative, it was not backward, but made great progress."

The "dismount faction" said: "The people have no consciousness, so they cannot establish a cooperative."

The "mount faction" said: "To say that the people have no consciousness is to smear the faces of the laboring people. After we established the cooperative, the members loved the collective, loved the country, and loved socialism. Is this not consciousness?"

The "dismount faction" said: "According to the instructions from higher authorities, the situation in the Nujiang River region is special, and private ownership must remain unchanged for a long time."

The "mount faction" said: "The socialist system will inevitably replace the capitalist system, this is the law of development."

Under the invincible guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, the "dismount faction" was refuted to the point of being speechless. That "dismount minister" became angry and red-faced, saying: "You have a thousand reasons, ten thousand reasons, but I have only one reason, if the higher authorities do not allow it, you must disband!"

Everyone said: "We have Chairman Mao backing us, we are not afraid of your higher authorities!"

With the active support of the company, the broad masses finally withstood this black wind and guarded this socialist stronghold. Under the joint efforts of the military and the people, this cooperative became better and better.

In the struggle to criticize the Chinese Khrushchev, the Party branch organized everyone to seriously study Chairman Mao's teachings on the issue of agricultural cooperativization. The comrades deeply felt that in the past, we had acted according to Chairman Mao's teachings and guarded a piece of socialist stronghold in the remote border of the motherland; however, due to the interference of the Chinese Khrushchev's reactionary line of restoring capitalism, over the past decade, the entire Nujiang River region's cooperativization had progressed very slowly, and some cooperatives were not even very solid. Facing this serious reality, all the comrades in the company were extremely indignant, and at the same time, they deeply felt their great responsibility. Everyone said: In the past, we only guarded a piece of socialist stronghold, but we did not plant the red flag of socialism throughout the entire Nujiang River region, which betrayed Chairman Mao's teachings to us and betrayed the trust and hopes of all the Dulong people. Looking back at the past and looking at today, everyone was full of confidence and unanimously expressed: We must definitely hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, riding the mighty east wind of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, mobilize the masses to deeply criticize the Chinese Khrushchev's counter-revolutionary revisionist line, eliminate its poison, and push agricultural cooperativization to every mountain and valley of the Nujiang River region, turning the Nujiang River region into an iron-clad socialist stronghold.

Therefore, the thirteen Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams of our company, distributed throughout the vast Nujiang River region, immediately mobilized the masses and launched a magnificent struggle of great criticism. We first focused on the issue of class enemies openly inciting individual farming, using the methods of recalling and comparing, and organizing denunciations, to concentrate on criticizing the individual farming wind. Large and small meetings, field corners, bamboo houses, and fire pits, everywhere was a battlefield of revolutionary great criticism. As soon as the individual farming wind was mentioned, the masses had endless bitterness and endless hatred. Everyone said: "In 1962, the individual farming wind blew into the Nujiang River, and the reactionary heads spread propaganda everywhere. Some people were deceived, and the result was harming people, harming the country. We have suffered enough from individual farming, and we will never walk this black road again!" The masses denounced and criticized the evil of capitalism, realizing that: Chairman Mao's revolutionary line is our lifeline, and the Chinese Khrushchev's revisionist line is the root of disaster and the root of revisionism; walking the socialist road pointed out by Chairman Mao is the road of happiness and brightness; walking the capitalist road advocated by the Chinese Khrushchev is the road of death and destruction. Everyone said: "The most poisonous grass is because it has poisonous roots; the individual farming wind blew in 1962 because there was a Chinese Khrushchev. His heart is as black as that of the reactionary local chiefs, more poisonous than the roots of poisonous grass. If we do not overthrow him, we will have no way out!"

The revolutionary great criticism was carried out magnificently. We were determined to advance and spread the flames of this struggle to every corner of the Nujiang River. There was a single household living in the deep mountains upstream of the Nujiang River, eight days' journey from the company, and even the farthest propaganda team from us was three days' journey away. The comrades heard that this family did not have a portrait of Chairman Mao or the "Quotations from Chairman Mao," and had not participated in the great criticism, and they were all very uneasy. Everyone said: "We must let the hearts of every Dulong laboring people shine with the red sun. Even if they live in the sky, we must find them." Squad leader Cao Zhizhong and two soldiers, carrying the portrait of Chairman Mao and the "Quotations from Chairman Mao," with a small pot for cooking, and a long knife, hacking through the tall grass taller than a person on the way, walked for three full days, finally finding this family. The comrades put down their bags, immediately cleaned the house clean, hung the portrait of Chairman Mao and the "Quotations from Chairman Mao" on the bamboo wall, put the shining gold badges of Chairman Mao on the woman of the house and the two children, and then propagated the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line to them, taught them to sing the songs of the "Quotations from Chairman Mao." In the evening, they also performed cultural programs praising Chairman Mao and criticizing the Chinese Khrushchev for them. This family was very moved after listening to the propaganda. When they parted, they tightly held Cao Zhizhong's hand and said: "Chairman Mao is the reddest red sun, the red sun has illuminated every valley of the Nujiang River! Chairman Mao sent the People's Liberation Army to visit us, we will never forget this for life. Please tell Chairman Mao that the poor Dulong people will forever follow the red sun!" Later, this family indeed came down from the mountain and joined the cooperative closest to them.

The process of criticizing the Chinese Khrushchev is also the process of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works and establishing Mao Zedong Thought. The poor Dulong people said: "Red flowers only bloom towards the sun, the Dulong people only follow Chairman Mao! We must follow Chairman Mao with one heart and rush towards socialism!" The revolutionary great criticism planted Chairman Mao's revolutionary line in the hearts of the revolutionary masses of the Dulong people, greatly enhancing the socialist consciousness of the masses. With the deepening of the great criticism, a magnificent socialist upsurge was set off, and the 300-mile-long Nujiang River region quickly achieved cooperativization, with all Dulong laboring people joining the cooperative. The Nujiang River region took on a new look, and the Dulong people had never been as spirited and enthusiastic as they are today! Last year, the grain production of the entire region increased by 58% compared to the previous year. The masses said: "This is the year of establishing Mao Zedong Thought, the year of a great leap forward!"

Greatly promote the study classes, turning the Nujiang River region into a red Mao Zedong Thought school

In this arduous and complex environment of the Nujiang River, we rely on Mao Zedong Thought to take root, grow, and overcome numerous difficulties, achieving one victory after another. The comrades have an infinite love for the great leader Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong Thought, and in any difficult and arduous situation, they insist on studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, achieving immovability like a mountain. The comrades said: "Our company is taking root in the Nujiang River with Mao Zedong Thought. The more arduous the environment, the more important it is to study Mao Zedong Thought well!" Once, a small squad went out on a patrol, active for twelve days, covering hundreds of miles, and most of the places they went to were uninhabited. When it rained heavily and they couldn't start a fire, they ate raw rice; when they couldn't find water, they ate fried rice; when the mountains were steep and they couldn't find a place to sleep, the comrades would light a fire on the hillside, cut down tree stumps, and nail them to the ground to block people. Everyone leaned against the tree stumps, in the firelight, studied Mao Zedong Thought. Sometimes, after searching and searching, there was only a muddy puddle to sit on. Everyone spread out an oilcloth on the muddy puddle, sat down, and held a meeting to share experiences, discussing the struggle against selfishness and the establishment of public spirit. The meeting on the muddy puddle, the struggle against selfishness was fierce, public spirit was firmly established, the soul was deeply touched, and consciousness was greatly enhanced. The comrades said that this was the most fruitful meeting to share experiences.

Once, we learned from a telegram that the higher authorities had sent us a batch of "Quotations from Chairman Mao," which had already been delivered to the other side of the snow mountain. The entire company immediately boiled over, and everyone eagerly requested to cross the snow mountain to bring back the precious book. The Party branch entrusted this task to Li Shunfeng and Peng Zhixiang, who had experience climbing snow mountains. At that time, it was just before the heavy snowfall, and the accumulated snow filled the valleys, covering the forests, and only the tips of the trees over ten meters high were visible. Li Shunfeng and Peng Zhixiang set out in the heavy snow, their clothes frozen stiff like cowhide, and their leg wraps frozen so tightly that they couldn't be untied. But they thought: Foreign friends, in order to seek revolutionary truth and obtain a book by Chairman Mao, do not hesitate to risk their lives; now we are shouldering the hopes of all the comrades in the company, going to bring back Chairman Mao's precious book, this is the most important and glorious task! They were not afraid of avalanches, and when they fell into snow pits, they crawled out and continued to advance. They repeatedly recited: "Make up your mind, do not be afraid of sacrifice, overcome all difficulties, and strive for victory." Overcoming numerous difficulties, they finally brought back the "Quotations from Chairman Mao" to the company.

We not only want to establish Mao Zedong Thought in our minds, but also want to make the entire Nujiang River region a red Mao Zedong Thought school. The Party branch required all the comrades in the company, no matter where they went, to "spread red seeds and plant loyal roots," arming the masses with Mao Zedong Thought and vigorously promoting the mass movement of studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought. Many of the brothers of various ethnic minorities in the company, although their cultural level was relatively low and they could not read many characters, had a deep class sentiment for the great leader Chairman Mao, and each of them was an outstanding propagandist of Mao Zedong Thought. The Naxi soldier He Lijia, whenever he went to the masses, studied Chairman Mao's works with the masses, always taught them everything he had learned; whenever he sang with the masses, always sang all the songs of the "Quotations from Chairman Mao" he knew. The Lisu soldier Heipada used three days to teach an old grandfather to recognize the five shining gold characters "serve the people." Some old people said: "I love to read Chairman Mao's book the most, but the characters are small and I can't see them clearly." The soldiers immediately bought white paper with their own allowances, copied Chairman Mao's works into walnut-sized characters, and bound them into books to give to them. The old people, with both hands, received the handwritten Mao Zedong Thought books from the soldiers, and were so moved that tears streamed down their faces.

The comrades, together with the Dulong laboring people, studied and applied the "Three Constantly Read Articles," guiding the masses to consciously break with selfishness and establish public spirit, thoroughly peel off the skin of selfishness, and dig out the roots of selfishness. The masses recognized the ugly nature of selfishness, and one after another rose up to rebel against selfishness. They said: Selfishness is the fangs of a poisonous snake, the roots of poisonous grass, only by thoroughly uprooting it, can we plant red roots, grow red branches, bloom red flowers, and bear red fruits in ourselves. They took Zhang Zide, White, and Old Fool as examples of public spirit, and took "completely" and "thoroughly" serving the people as the standard for action. They no longer thought for one person or one family, no longer turned in the small sky and small earth, but thought of the big collective, the country, and the whole world in everything. A cooperative completed its production tasks ahead of schedule and actively went to support other cooperatives without asking for any rewards. The members said: "Thinking only of a small collective is the selfishness of a small sky and small earth, thinking of all collectives is the public spirit of a big sky and big earth." When delivering surplus grain to the state, everyone said: "The bumper harvest was seized by the spirit of public spirit. The People's Liberation Army selflessly came to help, and the members selflessly worked hard together. The grain of public spirit should be used for public spirit, dedicated to Chairman Mao, supporting the Cultural Revolution, supporting the world revolution!"

In October 1967, Chairman Mao's latest instructions: "To struggle against selfishness and criticize revisionism," blew like a spring breeze into the Nujiang River. Vice Chairman Lin issued a call: "To open various study classes, the central government will open them, local governments will open them, and various revolutionary mass organizations can also open them, turning the entire country into a Mao Zedong Thought school." The Party branch repeatedly studied Chairman Mao's latest instructions, deeply understanding that: Since the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, we have closely followed Chairman Mao's great strategic deployments, and under the invincible guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, thoroughly smashed the slave system and achieved agricultural cooperativization throughout the district. We want to continue to advance, we must take "struggle against selfishness and criticize revisionism" as the key, vigorously promote study classes, grasp the ideological transformation of the people, and build the entire Nujiang River region into a red Mao Zedong Thought school. Only in this way can we further consolidate the socialist collective ownership that has been established, making the socialist stronghold of the Nujiang River red for thousands of years and ten thousand years to come.

The Party branch issued a call to the entire company: "To open study classes in every village and hamlet, let the ten thousand mountains and rivers all turn red." The comrades in the entire company immediately took action, with the greatest enthusiasm, and together with the Dulong people, vigorously promoted study classes. Where there were villages and households, we opened study classes there. In the districts and townships, in the villages and households, and even in the families. Even the family that was eight days' journey from the company's station, our Mao Zedong Thought propaganda team also helped them open a study class. Through the vigorous promotion of study classes, the masses' infinite love for the great leader Chairman Mao was further enhanced, Mao Zedong Thought was deeply rooted in the hearts of the people, and the socialist collective ownership was fundamentally consolidated.

Our company, under the guidance of the great Mao Zedong Thought, has done some work; however, it is still far from the requirements of the great leader Chairman Mao for us. In the future, we must further comprehensively implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions, push the mass movement of studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought to a new stage, let the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought fly high in the border of the motherland, and fly forever!

    边防战士紧跟伟大领袖毛主席
    昆明部队学习毛主席著作先进集体、某部一连代表　李世全
    我们连队，驻守在祖国西南边疆的独龙江地区。这里和祖国内地之间，横隔着两条大江和海拔五千多米的高黎贡山、碧罗雪山。每年十二月到第二年六月，山顶积雪深达十几米，交通完全断绝。就是在雪化开山期间，也只有一条小道可以通行。
    人民战士无限忠于毛主席。我们虽然和北京远隔千山万水，但是，我们的同志颗颗红心向北京，紧跟伟大领袖毛主席。大雪能封住高山，封不住我们对毛主席的无限热爱，封不住我们活学活用毛泽东思想的热情，封不住我们坚决执行毛主席革命路线的赤胆忠心。七、八年来，我们天天读毛主席的著作，收听来自北京以毛主席为首的无产阶级司令部的声音，紧跟伟大统帅毛主席的伟大战略部署。全国人民斗争的大方向，就是我们斗争的大方向。我们紧紧抓住两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的斗争，大闹革命，同独龙族人民一起，沿着毛主席指引的社会主义方向和毛主席的无产阶级革命路线胜利前进。
    紧跟毛主席伟大战略部署，斩断中国赫鲁晓夫伸向独龙江的黑手
    一九六七年二月二十日，党中央发出给全国农村人民公社贫下中农和各级干部的信，号召人民解放军大力帮助群众搞好春耕生产。我们从收音机里收听到这封信，党支部立即作了研究。当时正是大雪封山，上级的具体安排还没有传达下来。是等上级的指示呢，还是立刻行动？支委会认为：毛主席为首的无产阶级司令部的声音就是命令，毛主席一声令下，边防战士就要闻风而动，奋勇向前！
    独龙江地区是云南贡山独龙族怒族自治县的第四区，共有四个乡。过去，我们的工作重点一直放在四乡。那几天，大家从收音机里听到，“一月革命”的风暴席卷全国，无产阶级革命派正在向党内一小撮走资派进行激烈的夺权斗争，阶级敌人正在大搞经济主义，企图用破坏生产来破坏革命。支委会分析了这一形势，认为在这个关键时刻，毛主席号召我们“抓革命，促生产”，我们就要不折不扣地坚决照办，决不能丢下一些地区不管。党支部决定：全连要挺身而出，把工作从四乡一直推向整个独龙江地区，发动群众把全区革命和生产重担挑起来。于是，我们就把全连大部分同志组成十三个毛泽东思想宣传队，撒向三百多里长的独龙江地区。
    独龙江地区，地广人稀，我们越往前走路越小，小到没有路；越往前走人越少，少到只有两三户人家就算个“大村庄”。已经是春耕大忙时节，下地劳动的人还很少。看到这种情况，许多同志都很焦急。为了弄清情况，我们就深入到群众中去作调查。在调查中发现：中国赫鲁晓夫宣扬的“阶级斗争熄灭”论，以及他那一套反革命修正主义路线，在这个地区有着很深的影响。省、地、州、县的党内一小撮走资派，公然提出私有制“长期不变”的反动口号，宣扬“独龙江地区阶级分化不明显，阶级斗争不明显”。虽然解放十七年了，一些反动土司和奴隶主还在残酷地压迫剥削人民。听到这些情况，大家满腔怒火，深深感到这里阶级斗争十分尖锐。针对活生生的阶级斗争现实，党支部组织大家学习了毛主席关于阶级斗争的教导。毛主席说：“阶级斗争是客观存在，不依人的意志为转移的。”抓革命，就是要抓阶级斗争。抓不抓阶级斗争，这是在边疆建设上两条路线斗争的焦点。过去，以中国赫鲁晓夫为代表的党内最大的一小撮走资派，就是竭力宣扬“阶级斗争熄灭”论，抹煞阶级斗争严重存在的事实，妄想让反动的土司和奴隶主继续骑在人民的头上作威作福。大家愤怒地说：“共产党就是搞阶级斗争的，解放军就是解放人民的。我们一定要高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，把剥削制度砸个稀巴烂，彻底斩断中国赫鲁晓夫伸向独龙江地区的黑手！”
    在党支部领导下，全连同志分别深入到一家一户去，和群众同吃、同住、同劳动，广泛宣传无产阶级文化大革命的伟大意义，组织群众学习毛主席关于阶级斗争的论述。毛主席说：“民族斗争，说到底，是一个阶级斗争问题。”“人民靠我们去组织。中国的反动分子，靠我们组织起人民去把他打倒。凡是反动的东西，你不打，他就不倒。”毛主席的话，字字句句象泉水一样流进群众的心里。每天晚上，群众都是学了又学，唱了又唱，学到深夜还不想走。
    伟大的毛泽东思想武装了独龙江地区广大群众，阶级斗争的烈火越烧越旺。从一乡到四乡，整个独龙江地区都沸腾起来了，到处都在清算反动土司和奴隶主的罪行。劳动群众喜笑颜开，扬眉吐气。群众热烈欢呼毛主席领导的无产阶级文化大革命：“千个好，万个好，千年积雪融化了，万里云雾拨开了，红太阳真的出来了！”在大会上，刚刚获得解放的女奴隶巴比，穿着部队送给她的新衣，看看胸前的毛主席像章，高举红彤彤的《毛主席语录》，喊一声毛主席万岁，流下一行热泪。她万分激动地说：“是毛主席解放了我，是文化大革命解放了我。最亮的星星是北斗星，最大的恩人是毛主席。我要跟毛主席干一辈子革命，打倒中国赫鲁晓夫，把吃人的豺狼统统消灭掉！”
    阶级斗争的现实教育了群众，广大群众的阶级觉悟大大提高，他们说：“毒蛇最毒有毒牙，毒草最毒有毒根，独龙人穷苦有黑线，不把黑线拔掉，我们还要再当奴隶。”大家说：“‘千万不要忘记阶级斗争’，是伟大领袖毛主席的教导。我们就是要念念不忘阶级斗争，一直斗下去，斗到阶级敌人统统被消灭，斗出一个通红通红的毛泽东思想新世界！”
    掀掉了压在群众头上的大石板，春耕生产搞得热火朝天，广大群众克服了种种困难，大搞农田基本建设，开出了层层梯田，耕地面积比原来扩大了三分之一。这是毛泽东思想的伟大胜利，是毛主席革命路线的伟大胜利。
      狠抓革命大批判，把社会主
  义红旗插遍独龙河谷
    去年四月，全国无产阶级革命派和广大革命群众，向中国赫鲁晓夫发起了猛烈进攻，开展了轰轰烈烈的革命大批判。党支部立刻分析了这个形势，组织全连同志反复收听有关文章和消息，讨论怎样紧跟毛主席的战略部署，怎样在独龙河谷开展革命的大批判，进一步搞好两条路线斗争。
    两条路线斗争的实质，是搞社会主义，还是搞资本主义。中国赫鲁晓夫在三年困难时期，恶毒攻击三面红旗，推行“三自一包”的修正主义路线，我们独龙江地区受害很深。一提到这个问题，大家就满腔怒火，忘不了我们前几年在独龙江地区所进行的斗争。
    我们连队从一九六一年进驻这个雪山峡谷后，就决心高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，引导独龙族人民走社会主义道路。一九六一年，我们在马库村办起了第一个合作社。办社的第一年，社会主义集体生产的优越性就充分显示出来了，社员们的社会主义劳动热情空前高涨，粮食生产获得丰收。可是到了一九六二年底，也就是马库合作社连续获得两年丰收的那一年，从上面来了一个什么部长，这家伙刚到这里，屁股还没有坐热，就哇啦哇啦大发议论，说什么独龙江地区“落后”呀，“群众没有觉悟”呀，根据上级的指示，边疆的私有制要“长期不变”呀，硬要把这个合作社砍掉。毛主席说：“这里看来只有一字之差，一个要下马，一个要上马，却是表现了两条路线的分歧。”根据毛主席的教导，群众把这位部长和支持这位部长的反动土司、奴隶主称为“下马派”，把我们连队和革命群众称为“上马派”。“上马派”和“下马派”之间，当时发生了一场大论战。
      “下马派”说：“独龙江地区落后，解放前还刀耕火种，不能办合作社。”
      “上马派”说：“正因为落后，更要办合作社。毛主席说：‘除了社会主义，再无别的出路。’‘全国大多数农民，为了摆脱贫困，改善生活，为了抵御灾荒，只有联合起来，向社会主义大道前进，才能达到目的。’我们办社以后，不是落后了，而是大大前进了。”
      “下马派”说：“群众没有觉悟，不能办社。”
      “上马派”说：“说群众没有觉悟，就是往劳动人民脸上抹黑。我们办社以后，社员热爱集体，热爱国家，热爱社会主义，这难道不是觉悟？”
      “下马派”说：“上级指示，独龙江地区情况特殊，私有制要长期不变。”
      “上马派”说：“社会主义制度终究要代替资本主义制度，这是发展规律。”
    在战无不胜的毛泽东思想的指引下，“下马派”被驳得理屈词穷。那位“下马部长”恼羞成怒，脸红脖子粗地说：“你们千条理，万条理，我只有一条理，上级不准办，你们就得解散！”
    大家说：“我们有毛主席撑腰，不怕你那个什么上级！”
    在连队的积极支持下，广大群众终于顶住了这股黑风，守住了这块社会主义阵地。在军民的共同努力下，这个合作社越办越好。
    在愤怒批判中国赫鲁晓夫的斗争中，党支部组织大家认真学习了毛主席关于农业合作化问题的论述。同志们深刻体会到，过去我们按照毛主席的教导办事，守住了祖国遥远边疆的一块社会主义阵地；但是，由于中国赫鲁晓夫复辟资本主义的反动路线的干扰，十多年来，整个独龙江地区的合作化进展十分缓慢，而且一些合作社还不很巩固。面对这个严重的现实，全连同志无比愤慨，同时也深深感到自己的责任重大。大家说：过去我们只是守住了一块社会主义阵地，没有把社会主义的红旗插向整个独龙江地区，这就辜负了毛主席对我们的教导，辜负了全体独龙族人民对我们的信任和希望。想过去，看今天，大家信心百倍地一致表示：一定要高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，乘着无产阶级文化大革命的浩荡东风，发动群众深入批判中国赫鲁晓夫的反革命修正主义路线，肃清它的流毒，把农业合作化推向独龙江地区的每一座高山峡谷，把独龙江地区变成社会主义的铁打的江山。
    于是，我们连队分布在独龙江广大地区的十三个毛泽东思想宣传队，立即发动群众，展开了一场声势浩大的革命大批判运动。我们首先抓住阶级敌人公开煽动搞单干这个问题，采用回忆对比、组织控诉的方法，集中力量批判单干风。大会小会，田边地角，竹楼里，火塘边，到处都是革命大批判的战场。一提起单干风，群众就有诉不尽的苦，说不完的恨。大家说：“一九六二年单干风刮到独龙江，反动头人到处宣传，有人上了他们的当，结果是害人害己害国家。我们吃尽了单干的苦头，再也不走这条黑路了！”群众控诉和批判了资本主义的罪恶，认识到：毛主席的革命路线是我们的命根，中国赫鲁晓夫的修正主义路线是祸根、修根；走毛主席指引的社会主义道路是幸福路、光明路；走中国赫鲁晓夫鼓吹的资本主义道路是死路、绝路。大家说：“乌头草最毒，是因为有毒根；一九六二年刮单干风，是因为出了个中国赫鲁晓夫。他的心和土司头人的心一样黑，比乌头根还要毒。不把他打倒，就没有我们的活路！”
    革命的大批判，轰轰烈烈地开展起来了。我们决心乘胜前进，把这场斗争的烈火烧到独龙江的每一个角落。有一个独家户，住在独龙江上游的深山里，离连队有八天路程，离我们最远的一个宣传队也有三天路程。同志们听说这家人还没有毛主席像和毛主席语录，还没有参加大批判，都很不安。大家说：“我们一定让每一个独龙族劳动人民的心中都升起红太阳。就是住在天上，也要把他找到。”排长曹之中和两个战士，带上毛主席像和毛主席语录，背上做饭用的小锅，带上长刀，一路上砍着一人多高的茅草前进，足足走了三天，终于把这家人找到了。同志们放下背包，立刻把这家打扫得干干净净，在竹笆墙上贴好毛主席像和毛主席语录，把金光闪闪的毛主席像章戴在女主人和两个小孩身上，接着就向他们宣传无产阶级文化大革命，宣传毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，教他们唱毛主席语录歌。晚上，又给他们演出了歌颂毛主席、批判中国赫鲁晓夫的文艺节目。这家人听了宣传，十分感动。分别的时候，紧紧拉住曹之中的手说：“毛主席是最红最红的红太阳，红太阳把独龙江每个沟沟都照亮了！毛主席派解放军来看我们，我们一辈子也忘不了。请你们告诉毛主席他老人家，穷苦的独龙人永远跟着红太阳走！”以后，这家人果然走下山来，参加了离他们最近的合作社。
    批判中国赫鲁晓夫的过程，也就是活学活用毛主席著作、大立毛泽东思想的过程。贫苦的独龙族群众说：“红花只向太阳开，独龙族人民只跟毛主席走！我们要一个心眼跟着毛主席，奔向社会主义！”革命的大批判，把毛主席的革命路线扎根在独龙族革命群众的心里，大大提高了群众的社会主义觉悟。随着大批判的不断深入，掀起了一个轰轰烈烈的社会主义高潮，三百里长的独龙江地区很快实现了合作化，独龙族劳动人民全部入了社。独龙江地区出现了新的面貌，独龙族人民从来没有象今天这样精神振奋、斗志昂扬！去年整个地区的粮食产量比前年增长了百分之五十八。群众说：“这是大立毛泽东思想的一年，是大翻身的一年！”
      大办学习班，把独龙江地区
  办成红彤彤的毛泽东思想大学校
    在独龙江这个艰苦复杂的斗争环境里，我们靠毛泽东思想扎根，靠毛泽东思想成长，靠毛泽东思想克服重重困难，取得了一个又一个的胜利。同志们对伟大领袖毛主席和毛泽东思想无限热爱，在任何艰难困苦的场合，都坚持活学活用毛主席著作，做到了雷打不动。同志们说：“我们连是靠毛泽东思想在独龙江扎根的。环境越险恶，任务越繁重，越要学好毛泽东思想！”有一次，一个小分队出去巡逻，活动十二天，行程数百里，所到之处大多没有人烟。下大雨烧不着火，就吃生米；找不到水，就吃炒米；山陡，找不到睡觉的地方，同志们就在山坡上烧起一堆柴火，砍来树桩钉在地上把人挡住。大家脚蹬树桩，映着火光，学习毛泽东思想。有时候找来找去，只有一块泥塘可以坐一坐。大家就在泥塘上垫上油布，坐下来开讲用会，畅谈破私立公的体会。泥塘上的讲用会，“私”字斗得狠，“公”字立得牢，灵魂触得深，觉悟大提高。同志们说，这是收获最大的一次讲用会。
    有一次，我们从电报上得知，上级给我们发了一批《毛主席语录》，已经运到雪山那边。全连立刻沸腾起来，纷纷要求过雪山去把宝书背回来。党支部把这个任务交给了爬雪山有经验的战士李顺丰和彭志祥。当时正是大雪快要封山的时候，积雪填平了箐沟，盖住了丛林，十多米高的大树，也只露出一点树尖尖。李顺丰和彭志祥冒着大雪出发，身上的衣服冻得象牛皮一样，脚上的绑腿也解不开。但是他们想到：外国朋友为了寻求革命真理，为了得到一本毛主席的宝书，不惜冒生命的危险；现在我们肩负全连同志的希望，去背毛主席的宝书，这是最重大、最光荣的任务！他们遇到雪崩不怕危险，陷进雪窝爬出来又继续前进，他们一次又一次地背诵：“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利。”克服了重重困难，终于把《毛主席语录》背回连队。
    我们不仅要在自己的头脑里大立毛泽东思想，还要让整个独龙江地区成为红彤彤的毛泽东思想大学校。党支部要求全连同志，无论走到什么地方，都要“撒红种，扎忠根”，用毛泽东思想武装群众，大力开展活学活用毛泽东思想的群众运动。连里的许多兄弟民族战士，虽然文化比较低，识字不多，但是，他们对伟大领袖毛主席有着深厚的阶级感情，个个都是出色的毛泽东思想宣传员。纳西族战士和立甲每逢到群众中去，和群众一起学习毛主席著作，总要把他学过的统统教完；和群众一起唱歌，总要把他会唱的毛主席语录歌一首不留地唱完。傈僳族战士黑帕达，用了三天时间，才教会一个老阿爸认识“为人民服务”五个金光闪闪的大字。有的老年人说：“毛主席的书我最爱读，就是字小，看不清楚。”战士们立刻用自己的津贴买来白纸，把毛主席著作抄成核桃大的字，订成本本送给他们。老人双手接过战士们手抄的毛主席著作，感动得热泪直流。
    同志们和独龙族劳动人民一起，活学活用“老三篇”，引导群众自觉地破私立公，大剥“私”字的画皮，大挖“私”字的老根。群众认识了“私”字的丑恶本质，纷纷起来造“私”字的反。他们说：“私”字是毒蛇的牙，毒草的根，只有彻底拔掉，才能在自己身上扎红根，长红枝，开红花，结红果。他们把张思德、白求恩、老愚公三个光辉形象作为“公”字的榜样，把“完全”、“彻底”为人民服务作为行动的标准。他们不再为一人一家着想，不再在小天小地里转了，而是事事想到大集体，想到国家，想到全世界。一个合作社提前完成生产任务，就主动去支援其他社，不要任何报酬。社员们说：“只想一个小集体，是小天小地的私，想到所有的集体，是大天大地的公。”交售公余粮的时候，大家说：“丰收是靠‘公’字夺来的。解放军大公无私来帮助，社员大公无私齐努力。‘公’字粮要用在‘公’字上，献给毛主席，支援文化大革命，支援世界革命！”
    一九六七年十月，毛主席的最新指示：“要斗私，批修”，象春风吹到独龙江。林副主席发出号召：“要开办各种学习班，中央办，地方办，各个革命群众组织也可以办，把全国办成毛泽东思想的大学校。”党支部反复学习了毛主席的最新指示，深刻体会到：无产阶级文化大革命以来，我们紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，在战无不胜的毛泽东思想指引下，彻底摧毁了奴隶制度，全区实现了农业合作化。我们要继续前进，就要以“斗私，批修”为纲，大办学习班，狠抓人的思想革命化，把整个独龙江地区建设成为红彤彤的毛泽东思想大学校。只有这样，才能进一步巩固已经建立起来的社会主义集体所有制，使独龙江的社会主义江山千秋万代红下去。
    党支部向全连发出号召：要“村村寨寨开办学习班，让千山万壑都红遍。”全连同志立即行动起来，以最大的热情，和独龙族人民一起大办学习班。哪里有村寨，哪里有人家，我们就在哪里办学习班。在区乡办，村寨办，家庭办。就连离连队驻地有八天路的那一家，我们的毛泽东思想宣传队，也帮助她一家人办起了学习班。通过大办学习班，群众对伟大领袖毛主席更加无限热爱，毛泽东思想更加深入人心，从根本上巩固了社会主义集体所有制。
    我们连队，在伟大的毛泽东思想指引下，虽然做了一些工作；但是，距离伟大领袖毛主席对我们的要求，还差得很远。今后，我们一定要进一步全面落实毛主席的最新指示，把活学活用毛泽东思想的群众运动推向更新的阶段，让毛泽东思想伟大红旗，在祖国的边疆高高飘扬，永远飘扬！
