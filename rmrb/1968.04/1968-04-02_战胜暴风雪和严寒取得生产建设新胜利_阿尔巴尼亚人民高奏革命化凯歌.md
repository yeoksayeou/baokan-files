Last winter and this spring, Albania experienced an unprecedented severe cold snap. Many places were hit by blizzards. In some mountainous areas, snow accumulated to depths of over two meters, and temperatures dropped to minus twenty or thirty degrees Celsius, posing significant challenges to production and construction. However, under the leadership of Comrade Enver Hoxha and the Albanian Labour Party, the heroic Albanian people, holding high the great red banner of ideological revolution, displayed a daring spirit of struggle and victory. They fought bravely against the blizzards and severe cold, creating many moving deeds and singing another triumphant song of ideological revolution.

Albanian miners and loggers working underground and in the open air persevered in production despite the harsh conditions of rain and snow, and howling winds. Following the completion of last year's annual production plan, they exceeded this year's January production plan for coal and timber. The Mborje Drejnova coal mine in Korça region produced over a thousand tons of coal above the plan in January. The underground production team at the Dheu i Jazhës copper mine in Kukës region, named after the heroic socialist labor martyr Mehmet Shehu, who sacrificed himself for the public good, completed the January production plan ten days ahead of schedule and exceeded the plan by over four hundred tons of copper ore. The quarry workers at the Shkodër cement plant fought on the ice-covered, wind-swept mountains, ensuring uninterrupted production for the entire plant. Loggers battling in the snow-covered forests of Pukë region, where the snow was knee-deep and water froze instantly, completed the January production plan five days ahead of schedule and exceeded it. The geological survey and drilling team of the Bulqizë chromium mine traversed the snow-covered mountains, carrying several dozen kilograms of surveying and drilling equipment, to search for precious mineral resources for the motherland.

Construction workers also bravely fought against the severe cold to build more and better economic and cultural projects for the country. Construction workers in Dibër and Librazhd regions overcame the difficulties caused by the severe cold, using hot water to melt the ice on bricks and mixing salt with lime to prevent freezing, and with the support of the people nationwide, repaired and rebuilt earthquake-damaged houses in less than a month. Construction workers in Gjirokastër region exceeded the January production plan by 10%. Workers building the country's largest Vau i Dejës hydroelectric power station are fighting day and night on the construction site for the country's electrification.

In this battle against the cold wave, transportation and communication workers achieved outstanding results. Nua Baruca, a telephone line maintenance worker at the Kukës telecommunications bureau, learned from the example of Petër Dod, a maintenance worker and socialist labor hero who died heroically last year. Together with three members of an agricultural production cooperative, he braved the blizzards and avalanches, crossing mountain roads knee-deep in snow, overcoming numerous difficulties, and finally restored the telephone lines that had been blown down by the blizzard. Heroic truck drivers cleared snow and opened roads, working day and night, transporting coal, copper, chromium, and timber from mining and forest areas to factories, power plants, and construction sites.

Broad masses of agricultural laborers, with a revolutionary spirit of fearlessness, turned winter idleness into winter busyness during the severe winter. Over seven thousand young men and women from various cities across the country went to the mountains and countryside to reclaim land with the farmers. By January alone, the country had reclaimed over two thousand hectares of land. Members of agricultural production cooperatives, in addition to strengthening wheat field management, also used the winter to dredge and repair irrigation canals in the frozen waterways.

Currently, the Albanian people are making all preparations for this year's spring farming production, determined to achieve an even greater harvest than last year.

    战胜暴风雪和严寒取得生产建设新胜利
    阿尔巴尼亚人民高奏革命化凯歌
    去冬今春，阿尔巴尼亚全国出现了多年来罕见的严寒。许多地方发生暴风雪。有的山区积雪深达两米以上，气温下降到摄氏零下二、三十度，给生产建设带来了不小的困难。但是，在以霍查同志为首的阿尔巴尼亚劳动党领导下的英雄的阿尔巴尼亚人民，高举思想革命化的伟大红旗，发扬敢于斗争、敢于胜利的革命精神，同暴风雪和严寒展开了一场英勇的斗争，创造了许多动人的事迹，奏出了又一曲思想革命化的凯歌。
    在井下和野外作业的阿尔巴尼亚矿工和伐木工人，在雨雪交加、朔风怒号的气候条件下，坚持生产。他们继去年超额完成全年生产计划以后，今年一月份煤和木材的生产计划又超额完成。科尔察区姆博叶·德列诺瓦煤矿今年一月份超计划生产一千多吨煤。库克斯区杰齐昂铜矿有一个以舍己为公而光荣牺牲的社会主义劳动英雄穆哈梅特·希胡的名字命名的井下生产队，提前十天完成了今年一月份生产计划，超额开采四百多吨铜矿石。斯库台水泥厂的采石工人奋战在冰雪覆盖、北风凛冽的高山上，保证了全厂生产不间断地进行。战斗在雪深没膝、滴水成冰的普克区森林里的伐木工人，也提前五天超额完成了一月份生产计划。佩什科比区布尔契泽铬矿勘察队和钻探人员的足迹遍布了白雪茫茫的崇山峻岭。他们背着几十公斤重的测量和钻探仪器，踏雪涉水，为祖国寻找宝贵的矿藏。
    建筑战线上的职工也同严寒进行了英勇的搏斗，为国家建设更多、更好的经济文化项目。迪勃拉和利布拉什德地区的建筑工人克服严寒所造成的困难，用热水融化砖上的冰层，用食盐拌在石灰上防止冻结，终于在全国人民的大力支援下，在不到一个月的时间里，就修复和重建了因地震损坏的房屋。吉诺卡斯特区的建筑工人超额百分之十完成了今年一月份生产计划。正在建设全国最大的沃德耶水电站的工人，为了国家电气化日日夜夜奋战在工地上。
    在这场同寒流的斗争中，交通电讯运输战线上的职工作出了出色的成绩。库克斯电讯局电话线检修工努艾·巴鲁查，学习去年英勇牺牲的检修工、社会主义劳动英雄彼得·多德的榜样，同三个农业生产合作社社员一起，冒着暴风雪和雪崩的危险，穿过雪深及腰的山路，克服重重困难，终于接通了被暴风雪刮断的电话线。英雄的汽车司机，铲雪开路，日夜兼程，把矿区和林区的煤、铜、铬和木材等源源运往工厂、热电站和建筑工地。
    广大农业劳动者在隆冬大寒季节里，以革命的大无畏精神，变冬闲为冬忙。全国各城市有七千多名男女青年上山下乡，同农民一起开荒。仅今年一月份，全国就已开荒二千公顷。广大农业生产合作社社员除了加强麦田管理以外，还利用冬闲，在冰冻刺骨的水渠中挖泥修渠。
    目前，阿尔巴尼亚人民正在为今年的春耕生产作好一切准备，决心夺取比去年更大的丰收。　　（据新华社）
