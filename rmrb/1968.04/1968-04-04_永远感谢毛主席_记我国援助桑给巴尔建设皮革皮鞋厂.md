The leather and shoe factory built with aid from China in the Republic of Zanzibar, is located in the northern suburbs of Zanzibar City, in Maruhubi. Just a year ago, what people saw here were the ruins of the Sultan's palace and cannon emplacements from the era of slave trading. Today, on this hillside by the sea, a set of brand-new modern factory buildings has appeared. This is the fruit of the friendship between the peoples of China and Tanzania, and the result of the joint labor of Chinese engineering and technical personnel and Zanzibari workers.

This modern factory covers an area of approximately 10,400 square meters, with a building area of more than 3,300 square meters. It can take fresh cow and sheep hides from slaughterhouses, tan and process them into various types of leather, and then make them into shoes for production. It can produce 12,000 cow and sheep hides per year, and manufacture 20,000 pairs of men's and women's shoes and sandals. This, one of the largest factories on the island of Zanzibar, took only nine months from the start of construction to the start of production.

The completion of this factory has enabled Zanzibar to end its complete dependence on imports for leather and shoes, and has helped Zanzibar in its efforts to be self-reliant and develop its national economy.

Many Zanzibari friends who came to visit the factory were amazed at the high quality and speed of the construction, at the speed with which Zanzibari workers mastered various modern leather and shoe-making technologies, and at the exquisite and beautiful shoes made from Zanzibari cowhide. They said, "This factory is a source of pride for the people of Zanzibar." "We are extremely grateful to Chairman Mao. It was Chairman Mao who sent Chinese engineering and technical personnel to help us build." "We will forever remember Chairman Mao's selfless aid."

Early last year, Chinese engineering and technical personnel, following Chairman Mao's instructions to serve the people of the whole of China and the whole world, came to East Africa's Zanzibar with the ambition to aid in the construction of the Tanzanian people. Comrades on the construction site studied the "Quotations from Chairman Mao" every morning and evening, reciting the "Three Constantly Read Articles." The spirit of Comrade Zhang Zedong serving the people, Dr. Norman Bethune's internationalism, and the Old Man of the Mountain's determination to overcome difficulties, constantly inspired comrades to undertake arduous work.

In early April, the project officially began. At that time, it was the rainy season, and every day it rained heavily. As soon as the foundation of the factory was dug, it either accumulated water or collapsed. The construction site was filled with mud and puddles. The Chinese engineering and technical personnel did not retreat in the face of difficulties. They all pitched in, thinking of ways to drain the accumulated water, working early and late in the rain. Many comrades worked all day in the water. Seeing the Chinese workers' selfless work ethic, the Zanzibari workers were deeply moved and voluntarily worked with their Chinese friends in the rain and mud. After more than a month of intense effort, they finally completed the foundation work ahead of schedule.

To ensure the progress of the project and complete the factory construction ahead of schedule, the Chinese workers spared no effort, worked tirelessly, and took on the hardest and most laborious tasks. They worked with Zanzibari workers to study and improve operating methods, gradually increasing work efficiency. They also often used weekends and after-work time to repair and maintain machinery and vehicles. Once, the mixing machine's steam valve seat suddenly broke, and the Chinese technicians worked together all night to make and replace this crucial part, ensuring the normal operation of the mixing machine the next day.

The Chinese engineering and technical personnel faithfully carried out Chairman Mao's instructions, always maintaining the fine tradition of thrift and hard work. At the beginning, the relevant departments in Zanzibar, out of concern for the Chinese workers, prepared to arrange accommodations for the Chinese in the city and also prepared to provide six small cars, order a batch of sofas, wardrobes, and other furniture. The Chinese workers sincerely thanked the Zanzibar government for their concern, but for the convenience of work, they built simple accommodations themselves under the coconut trees on the construction site. They also suggested that the relevant departments in Zanzibar reduce the car allocation plan and cancel the furniture order.

The Chinese workers also set up a sign with Chairman Mao's quotations on the construction site: "Run factories, shops, and all state-owned and cooperative enterprises with thrift; run all other undertakings with thrift. Everything should be done on the principle of thrift." Many Zanzibari workers saw that the Chinese technicians were meticulous and frugal in building the enterprise for the people of Zanzibar, and they were deeply moved. They also voluntarily cherished tools, saved materials, and recycled waste materials on the construction site. A Tanzanian official respectfully said: "The Chinese friends do not go to dance halls, bars, or cinemas. All we see is them working, working, working on the construction site."

During the construction of the factory, the Chinese engineering and technical personnel enthusiastically and patiently helped the Zanzibari workers master new technologies. Chinese engineers often spread out blueprints with Zanzibari workers to study construction problems. An old Zanzibari mason excitedly said, "In the past, the British people looked down on us and never showed us the blueprints, stepping on us. Only the Chinese friends sent by Chairman Mao are our true friends." The Chinese workers also cared about the lives of Zanzibari workers, visiting sick workers at their homes. The Zanzibari workers also regarded the Chinese workers as their close friends. When a masonry team said goodbye to the Chinese workers at the end of the project, an African worker excitedly said: "We are very happy to work with Chinese friends. We have learned a lot of new ideas and technologies. We wish Chairman Mao a long life!"

The Zanzibari workers saw the great power of Mao Zedong Thought from the Chinese workers and loved Chairman Mao even more, respecting the boundless light of Mao Zedong Thought. Many workers asked Chinese friends for Chairman Mao's badges, portraits, and "Quotations from Chairman Mao." A concrete worker team hung up a portrait of Chairman Mao on the construction site, saying: "Seeing Chairman Mao, we feel full of strength." Many workers also often spontaneously recited Chairman Mao's quotations in unison: "Resolutely carry out the decision, fear no sacrifice, overcome all difficulties, and strive for victory."

### 永远感谢毛主席——记我国援助桑给巴尔建设皮革皮鞋厂

    永远感谢毛主席
    ——记我国援助桑给巴尔建设皮革皮鞋厂
    由中国援建的坦桑尼亚桑给巴尔国营皮革皮鞋厂，座落在桑给巴尔市北郊的马如呼比。在这里，一年前人们看到的，还是贩卖奴隶时代的苏丹王宫和炮台遗址的断柱残壁。如今，在这濒临碧海的小丘上，出现一片崭新的现代化厂房。这是中国和坦桑尼亚两国人民友谊的结晶，也是中国工程技术人员和桑给巴尔工人共同劳动的硕果。
    这座现代化的工厂，占地约一万零四百平方米，拥有建筑面积三千三百多平方米，可以把由屠宰场来的鲜牛羊皮，经过鞣制、整理、制成各种皮革，再制成皮鞋出厂。它每年能制牛羊革一万二千张，生产男女各式皮鞋、凉鞋等两万双。这个桑给巴尔岛上最大的工厂之一，从动工到建成投入生产，只用了九个月的时间。
    这座工厂的建成，使桑给巴尔结束了皮革皮鞋完全依赖进口的日子，有助于桑给巴尔自力更生、发展民族经济。
    许多前来参观的桑给巴尔朋友，看到工厂建设的质量好、速度快，看到桑给巴尔工人迅速掌握各种现代制革制鞋技术，看到用桑给巴尔牛皮制成各式精致美观的皮鞋，无不表示赞叹。他们说，“这个工厂是我们桑给巴尔人民的骄傲。”“我们万分感谢毛主席，是毛主席派中国工程技术人员来帮助我们建设。”“我们将永远记住毛主席给我们的无私援助。”
    去年初，中国工程技术人员遵循毛主席关于为全中国人民和全世界人民服务的教导，怀着支援兄弟的坦桑尼亚人民建设的雄心，来到东非的桑给巴尔。同志们在工地上早晚都学习《毛主席语录》，背诵“老三篇”。张思德同志为人民服务的思想，白求恩医生的国际主义精神，老愚公战胜困难的决心，时时鼓舞着同志们去从事艰巨的工作。
    四月初工程正式动工。当时正逢雨季，每天大雨倾盆，厂房基础一挖开，不是积水，就是塌方，工地上到处是泥浆水塘。中国工程技术人员并没有在困难面前退却。他们一齐动手，想方设法排除积水，起早带晚冒雨奋战，许多同志整日在水坑里工作。桑给巴尔工人看到中国工作人员这种忘我的工作精神，十分感动，自动跟中国朋友一起在大雨泥泞中工作。经过一个多月的紧张努力，终于抢先完成了基础工程。
    为了保证工程进度，提前完成建厂任务，中国工作人员不辞劳苦，不计时间，抢苦活累活干，同桑给巴尔工人一起研究改进操作方法，逐步提高了工作效率。他们还经常利用星期日和下班后的时间检修和维护机械、车辆。有一次，搅拌机的汽门座足突然断裂，中国技术人员一齐动手，通宵达旦，赶制出并换上了这个关键零件，保证了第二天搅拌机的正常运转。
    中国工程技术人员忠实执行毛主席的教导，时刻保持勤俭节约、艰苦朴素的优良作风。开始，桑给巴尔有关部门，出于对中国工作人员的关怀，准备在市区为中国人员安排宿舍，还准备提供六辆小汽车，订购一批沙发、衣柜和其他家具。中国工作人员衷心感谢坦桑尼亚桑给巴尔政府的关怀，但为了便利工作，他们自己动手，因陋就简，在工地的椰树林下搭建起简易的宿舍。他们还建议桑给巴尔有关部门削减供车计划，取消家具订货。
    中国工作人员还在工地上竖起毛主席语录牌：“勤俭办工厂，勤俭办商店，勤俭办一切国营事业和合作事业，勤俭办一切其他事业，什么事情都应当执行勤俭的原则。”许多桑给巴尔工人看见中国技术人员为建设桑给巴尔人民的企业，精打细算，节约开支，很受感动。他们也自动地爱护工具，节约用料，回收工地上的废旧物品。一位坦桑尼亚官员敬佩地说：“中国朋友不逛舞厅，不去酒吧间，不上电影院，只看见他们在工地上工作，工作，工作。”
    中国工程技术人员在建厂过程中热忱地耐心地帮助桑给巴尔工人兄弟掌握新技术。中国工程师们常常摊着图纸同桑给巴尔工人研究施工问题。一个桑给巴尔老瓦工激动地说，“过去英国人根本看不起我们，从不给我们看图纸，把我们踩在脚底下。只有毛主席派来的中国朋友，才是我们真正的朋友。”中国工作人员还很关心桑给巴尔工人的生活，登门探望生病的工人，桑给巴尔工人也把中国工作人员当做自己的知心朋友。当一个泥工小组在工程结束向中国工作人员告别时，一个非洲工人激动地说：“我们很乐意跟中国朋友在一起工作。我们学习到不少新思想、新技术。我们祝毛主席万寿无疆！”
    桑给巴尔工人们从中国工作人员身上看到了毛泽东思想的伟大力量，他们更加热爱毛主席，更加崇敬光焰无际的毛泽东思想。许多工人向中国朋友要毛主席像章，毛主席画像，《毛主席语录》。一个混凝土工小组，在工地上挂起毛主席像，他们说：“看到毛主席，就感到浑身都是力量。”许多工人还常常不约而同地齐声背诵毛主席语录：“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利。”
