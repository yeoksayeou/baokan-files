We are deeply moved as we introduce to you the brilliant deeds of Comrade Liu Xuebao. This is a heroic epic written in revolutionary blood, a tribute to the great leader Chairman Mao, and a defense of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. It is a magnificent ode to Mao Zedong Thought, composed in the strongest tones of the times.

The era of Mao Zedong Thought is an era of heroes. Comrade Liu Xuebao emerged in the unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, amidst the great waves of struggle between the two classes, two lines, and two roads. He is a hero who defends the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and Chairman Mao's revolutionary line.

Comrade Liu Xuebao, a poor peasant by origin, was tempered and inspired by the blazing fires of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution upon joining the army. On the front lines of "Three Supports, Two Militaries," he firmly remembered Chairman Mao's teaching: "Never forget class struggle." He harbored deep hatred and high vigilance against class enemies. He stood firmly on Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, fighting alongside local revolutionary masses, continuously attacking class enemies. At critical moments, he bravely confronted and fought against counter-revolutionary elements engaged in sabotage, defused an imminent explosive device, and saved a newly built bridge. He thus made outstanding contributions to defending the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, defending proletarian dictatorship, and defending socialist construction.

Recently, the great leader Chairman Mao profoundly pointed out: The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is, in essence, a political revolution under socialist conditions, where the proletariat opposes the bourgeoisie and all exploiting classes. It is a continuation of the long-term struggle between the Chinese Communist Party and the revolutionary masses it leads, and the Kuomintang reactionaries. It is a continuation of the class struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie. Comrade Liu Xuebao's participation in the struggle at the Yinding County Liancheng Experimental Forest Farm is a microcosm of this political revolution.

"All reactionary forces on the verge of extinction will make their last struggles against the revolutionary forces." The closer the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is to complete victory, the more desperately the class enemies will struggle. The attempt by historical counter-revolutionaries, protected by the walking capitalists of the forest farm, to sabotage the bridge is a desperate act of a cornered dog.

Comrade Liu Xuebao turned Chairman Mao's teachings on class and class struggle into his soul. At the moment when the masses were celebrating the establishment of the revolutionary committee, he, with high revolutionary vigilance, timely detected the class enemies' sabotage activities. With brave and decisive actions, he thoroughly smashed the class enemies' evil plots, fulfilling his heroic oath: to defend Chairman Mao, Mao Zedong Thought, and Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line with his blood and life. Comrade Liu Xuebao's heroic deeds once again vividly show that those armed with Mao Zedong Thought are the most selfless, bravest, smartest, most conscious, and most perceptive. In the face of such heroic fighters, there is no difficulty that cannot be overcome, no enemy that cannot be defeated, and no miracle that cannot be created.

We must, like Comrade Liu Xuebao, actively learn and apply Mao Zedong Thought in class struggle, eliminate selfishness and establish public spirit, and reform our worldview, so that "in our hearts, there is only the red sun, and everything is dedicated to Chairman Mao." We must, like Comrade Liu Xuebao, raise our consciousness of class struggle and line struggle, and in the "Three Supports, Two Militaries," together with the broad revolutionary masses, actively and continuously attack class enemies. At present, as the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution achieves victory after victory, revolutionary committees are established one after another, and the "Three Supports, Two Militaries" work has achieved great success, we must not have the slightest complacency or relaxation. We must always remember class struggle, strengthen our enemy awareness a hundredfold, and guard against the sabotage activities of class enemies. We must resolutely oppose rightist splitism, rightist capitulationism, and rightist conservatism, repel the rightist reversal wind of class enemies, and defend Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line to the death, striving for the complete victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

    千万不要忘记阶级斗争
    《解放军报》评论员
    我们怀着十分激动的心情，向大家介绍刘学保同志的光辉事迹。这是用革命的热血写下的一首无限忠于伟大领袖毛主席、英勇保卫无产阶级文化大革命的英雄诗篇，是用时代的最强音谱出的又一曲毛泽东思想的壮丽凯歌。
    毛泽东思想新时代，是英雄辈出的时代。刘学保同志，是在史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命运动中，在两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线斗争的大风浪里，涌现出来的保卫无产阶级文化大革命、保卫毛主席革命路线的英雄战士。
    贫农出身的刘学保同志一入伍，就受到了无产阶级文化大革命的熊熊烈火的冶炼和熏陶。在“三支”“两军”第一线上，他牢记毛主席关于“千万不要忘记阶级斗争”的教导，对阶级敌人有刻骨的仇恨，高度的警惕。他坚定地站在毛主席的无产阶级革命路线上，同当地的无产阶级革命派一起，不停顿地向阶级敌人进攻。在关键时刻，他挺身而出，以最大的勇敢和智慧，只身同进行破坏活动的反革命分子搏斗，排除即将爆炸的炸药包，抢救了国家新建的大桥，为保卫无产阶级文化大革命，保卫无产阶级专政，保卫社会主义建设，建立了出色的功勋。
    伟大领袖毛主席最近深刻地指出：无产阶级文化大革命，实质上是在社会主义条件下，无产阶级反对资产阶级和一切剥削阶级的政治大革命，是中国共产党及其领导下的广大革命人民群众和国民党反动派长期斗争的继续，是无产阶级和资产阶级阶级斗争的继续。刘学保同志参加支左的永登县连城实验林场的斗争，就是这场政治大革命的一个缩影。
      “凡属将要灭亡的反动势力，总是要向革命势力进行最后挣扎的”。无产阶级文化大革命越是接近全面胜利，阶级敌人越要进行垂死挣扎。被林场走资派包庇的历史反革命分子企图破坏大桥的罪恶行径，就是阶级敌人狗急跳墙的一种绝望的表演。
    刘学保同志把毛主席关于阶级和阶级斗争的教导化为自己的灵魂。他在广大群众欢庆革命委员会成立的时刻，以高度的革命警惕性，及时察觉了阶级敌人的破坏活动。并且以英勇果敢的行动，彻底粉碎了阶级敌人的罪恶阴谋，实践了自己的豪迈誓言：用鲜血和生命保卫毛主席，保卫毛泽东思想，保卫毛主席的无产阶级革命路线。刘学保同志的英雄业绩再一次生动地说明：用毛泽东思想武装起来的人，最无私，最勇敢，最聪明，觉悟最高，眼睛最亮，嗅觉最灵。在这样的英雄战士面前，没有什么困难不能克服，没有什么敌人不能战胜，没有什么奇迹不能创造。
    我们一定要象刘学保同志那样，在阶级斗争中活学活用毛泽东思想，破私立公，改造世界观，做到“心中唯有红太阳，一切献给毛主席”。要象刘学保同志那样，把阶级斗争和路线斗争的觉悟提得高高的，在“三支”“两军”中，同广大革命群众一起，主动地、连续地向阶级敌人进攻。目前，在无产阶级文化大革命节节胜利、革命委员会纷纷建立、“三支”“两军”工作取得很大成绩的情况下，切不可有丝毫自满、松懈情绪，一定要念念不忘阶级斗争，百倍加强敌情观念，严防阶级敌人的破坏活动。要坚决反对右倾分裂主义、右倾投降主义、右倾保守主义，打退阶级敌人的右倾翻案黑风，誓死保卫毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利。
