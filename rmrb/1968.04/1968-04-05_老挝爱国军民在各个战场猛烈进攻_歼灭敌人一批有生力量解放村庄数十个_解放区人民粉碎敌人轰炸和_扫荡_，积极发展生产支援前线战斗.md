Laotian patriotic military and civilian forces have launched fierce attacks on various battlefields, annihilating a significant number of enemy forces and liberating dozens of villages.

In March, the patriotic military and civilian forces in Xaisomboun Province counterattacked the enemy's "creeping" advances in the districts of Muan and Muanxay on the 14th and 17th, and bombarded enemy strongholds, eliminating 123 enemy soldiers and seizing a batch of weapons and military supplies.

From March 7th to 19th, the patriotic military and civilian forces in Xam Neua Province bravely repelled the enemy's "sweeping" operations in the Thakhek region, annihilating a group of enemies and reclaiming 26 villages with a population of several thousand.

On March 3rd, the patriotic military and civilian forces in Savannakhet Province launched a fierce attack on the enemy in the southeastern part of the provincial capital, liberating four villages.

In the Nam Bokeo region of Luang Prabang Province, the patriotic military and civilian forces continued to hunt down remnants hiding in the jungle in March and pursued and annihilated enemy forces infiltrating the region for sabotage activities. Preliminary reports indicate that from March 18th to 24th, the patriotic military and civilian forces eliminated 46 enemy soldiers and seized numerous weapons.

Additionally, in the first half of March, over a hundred right-wing Laotian military personnel and bandits surrendered to the patriotic armed forces in this region.

The people of the liberated areas in Laos, under the leadership of the Lao Patriotic Front, have been developing transportation and forestry production while repelling the enemy's indiscriminate bombing and "sweeping" operations. This has ensured the livelihood of the people in the liberated areas and provided strong support for the frontline battles.

According to reports from the Pathet Lao News Agency, the people of the provinces of Xam Neua, Xieng Khouang, Nambak, and Phongsali in Laos have braved enemy airstrikes and shelling to build roads from the provinces to the districts, reducing the cargo transportation time between provinces and districts by half compared to before.

In addition to building roads between provinces and districts, many places have also constructed small paths for people and horses to transport goods. Local residents have made do with available materials, using ox carts, horse carts, and small boats to continuously transport supplies to the frontline. Due to the development of transportation, the supply of medical supplies, agricultural tools, and daily necessities for the people in the liberated areas of Laos has also increased.

Ninety percent of Laos is covered by forests, and forest resources play an important role in the Laotian economy. The Central Committee of the Lao Patriotic Front attaches great importance to the protection and rational development of forest resources. In addition to establishing survey teams, it has also widely propagated the importance of protecting primary forests and strengthened guidance to prevent farmers from damaging trees while farming in the mountains. The forest product output in the provinces of Xam Neua, Phongsali, Xieng Khouang, Udomsai, and Xam Neua in 1967 increased by one to two times compared to 1966, and the development of forest resources in other provinces has also shown significant progress.

According to a supplementary report from the Pathet Lao News Agency, on March 17th, the patriotic armed forces in Xam Neua Province bravely counterattacked the savage air raid by American air pirates on Xam Neua City, shooting down five American planes and damaging two.
