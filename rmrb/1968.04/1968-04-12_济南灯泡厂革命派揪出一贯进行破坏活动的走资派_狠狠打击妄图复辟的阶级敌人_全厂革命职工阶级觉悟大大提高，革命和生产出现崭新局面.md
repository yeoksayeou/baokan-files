The revolutionary faction of Jinan Lamp Factory, under the radiant guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, has exposed a capitalist-roader who has been consistently engaged in sabotage activities, aiming to disrupt the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. This has significantly raised the class consciousness of the revolutionary workers throughout the factory, leading to a new and vibrant situation of "grasp revolution, promote production."

Chairman Mao teaches us: "To disrupt, to fail, to disrupt again, to fail again until they are utterly ruined – this is the logic of imperialism and all reactionaries in the world when dealing with the affairs of the people. They will never deviate from this logic." The stubborn capitalist-roader in Jinan Lamp Factory has not deviated from this logic either.

At the early stage of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, when the revolutionary masses in the factory rose up to struggle against the capitalist-roader, the capitalist-roader, sensing his imminent doom, used his stolen power to suppress the revolution under the guise of focusing on production. When the revolutionary masses broke through various obstacles to expose his crimes, he vigorously promoted the capitalist line, labeling the revolutionary masses as "counter-revolutionaries." The revolutionary faction of the proletariat smashed his series of evil plots and successfully seized power from the handful of capitalist-roaders within the party.

The capitalist-roader, who is terrified and hates the Cultural Revolution to the core, is unwilling to accept his failure. Starting from last May, he adopted more sinister methods, attempting to disrupt production to achieve his evil goal of disrupting the Cultural Revolution. He incited some workers to leave their production posts, creating stop-work incidents. He incited some production management cadres to "not easily return to the factory." He also instructed people to block workers at the bus station, preventing them from going to work. This capitalist-roader himself hid outside for a long time, secretly influencing and manipulating some deceived masses, creating factions, causing splits, and fighting "internal wars," preventing the two factions from uniting, and making it impossible for workers to focus on revolution and production in the factory. He also incited some workers to engage in anarchism, disrupt labor discipline, and refuse to follow commands and transfers. As a result, the factory's production was severely affected. This capitalist-roader's series of plots to disrupt production were aimed at preventing the proletarian revolutionary faction from properly exercising power, disrupting the state's lamp supply work, shaking the new proletarian regime, and achieving his counter-revolutionary goal of restoring the old order.

"When the devil schemes, the gods devise countermeasures." The proletarian revolutionary faction in the factory fought back against the capitalist-roader's evil activities head-on. They bravely shouldered the dual responsibilities of revolution and production. On one hand, they firmly held their production posts, and on the other hand, they proactively took measures to mobilize the enthusiasm of the entire factory's personnel, striving to complete the production tasks. Recently, with the help of the People's Liberation Army's Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team stationed in the factory, they repeatedly and deeply studied Chairman Mao's latest instructions, further raising their class consciousness, strengthening their awareness of class struggle, and taking decisive measures against this capitalist-roader who had long been disrupting the revolution and production. They gave a resounding blow to the reactionary arrogance of the class enemy, greatly boosting the revolutionary spirit of the proletarian revolutionary faction.

"Class struggle, once grasped, is effective." After exposing the bad elements, the factory's revolution and production quickly took on a new look. The previously deceived masses had their class consciousness greatly raised and stood up to struggle against the capitalist-roader, exposing the cover of class struggle. The proletarian revolutionary faction also resolutely followed Chairman Mao's words, correctly treating the deceived masses. The factory also held various types of Mao Zedong Thought study classes, where revolutionary workers actively carried out self-criticism, unified their understanding, and united against the enemy. Revolutionary workers united on the basis of Mao Zedong Thought, quickly achieving the three-in-one combination. Broad revolutionary workers further responded to Chairman Mao's great call to "grasp revolution, promote production," with everyone striving to be a pioneer in revolution and a model in production. The factory's production quickly surged. Now, the daily production of lamps has stabilized and completed the tasks, sometimes even exceeding the highest level since the factory's establishment.

Many workers in the factory have deeply felt that the enemy class disrupts the revolution through production disruption, which is an important feature of the current class struggle situation. We must firmly remember Chairman Mao's teaching of "never forget class struggle," raise our revolutionary vigilance, and severely strike down any class enemy who dares to engage in disruption and sabotage.

    济南灯泡厂革命派揪出一贯进行破坏活动的走资派
    狠狠打击妄图复辟的阶级敌人
    全厂革命职工阶级觉悟大大提高，革命和生产出现崭新局面
    本报讯　在毛泽东思想的光辉照耀下，山东省济南灯泡厂的无产阶级革命派，揪出了妄图通过破坏生产来破坏无产阶级文化大革命的走资派，提高了广大革命职工的阶级觉悟，全厂出现了“抓革命，促生产”的蓬蓬勃勃的新局面。
    毛主席教导我们：“捣乱，失败，再捣乱，再失败，直至灭亡——这就是帝国主义和世界上一切反动派对待人民事业的逻辑，他们决不会违背这个逻辑的。”济南灯泡厂的顽固不化的走资派也没有违背这个逻辑。
    在无产阶级文化大革命运动初期，当这个厂的革命群众起来向走资派进行斗争的时候，厂里的走资派预感到自己已面临灭顶之灾，就利用窃取的权力，以抓生产为名，压制革命。当革命群众冲破种种阻力起来揭发他的罪行的时候，他又极力推行资产阶级反动路线，把革命群众打成
  “反革命”。全厂无产阶级革命派粉碎了他的一系列罪恶阴谋，胜利地夺了党内一小撮走资派的权。
    对文化大革命怕得要死、恨得要命的走资派，不甘心于自己的失败。从去年五月开始，他就采取了更加阴险的手段，妄图通过破坏生产来达到破坏文化大革命的罪恶目的。他煽动部分工人离开生产岗位，制造停工停产事件。他煽动一些管理生产的干部“不要轻易回厂”。他还指使人到公共汽车站阻拦工人上班。这个走资派本人长期潜藏在外，暗中影响和操纵部分受蒙蔽的群众，搞派性，闹分裂，打“内战”，使两派长期不能联合，使工人不能安心在厂里抓革命促生产。他还煽动部分工人搞无政府主义，破坏劳动纪律，不服从指挥调动。因此，厂里的生产受到很大影响。这个走资派玩弄这一系列破坏生产的阴谋，就是妄图使厂里的无产阶级革命派不能掌好权、用好权，妄图破坏国家的灯泡供应工作，动摇新生的无产阶级政权，实现其反革命复辟的罪恶目的。
      “魔高一尺，道高一丈。”这个厂的无产阶级革命派对走资派的罪恶活动进行了针锋相对的斗争。他们勇敢地担起革命和生产两副重担，一方面自己坚守生产岗位，一方面主动采取措施，调动全厂人员的积极性，力争完成生产任务。最近，他们又在驻厂解放军毛泽东思想宣传队的帮助下，反复深入地学习了毛主席的最新指示，进一步提高了阶级觉悟，增强了阶级斗争观念，对这个长期破坏革命和生产的走资派，采取了果断措施，狠狠地打击了阶级敌人的反动气焰，大长了无产阶级革命派的革命志气。
      “阶级斗争，一抓就灵”。这个厂的无产阶级革命派揪出坏人以后，全厂革命和生产迅速出现了新面貌。原来受蒙蔽的群众，阶级觉悟大大提高，纷纷起来同走资派展开斗争，大揭阶级斗争的盖子。无产阶级革命派也坚决听毛主席的话，正确对待受蒙蔽的群众。厂里还举办了各种类型的毛泽东思想学习班，革命职工在学习班上积极开展自我批评，统一认识，团结对敌。革命职工在毛泽东思想基础上联合起来，很快实现了革命的三结合。广大革命职工进一步响应毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的伟大号召，人人争当抓革命的闯将，促生产的模范，全厂生产迅速上升。现在，灯泡日产量已经稳定地完成任务，有时还超过了建厂以来的最高水平。
    这个厂的许多工人深有体会地说：阶级敌人通过破坏生产来破坏革命，这是当前阶级斗争形势的一个重要特点。我们一定要牢记毛主席“千万不要忘记阶级斗争”的教导，提高革命警惕性，狠狠打击胆敢进行破坏和捣乱的阶级敌人。
