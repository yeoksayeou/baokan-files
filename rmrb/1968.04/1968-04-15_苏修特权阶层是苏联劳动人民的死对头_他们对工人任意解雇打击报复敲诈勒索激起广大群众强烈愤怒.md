	Moscow, April 13 (New China News Agency) — Under the rule of the Brezhnev and Kosygin traitor clique, the bourgeois privileged class in Soviet cities and countryside is increasingly brutally oppressing and exploiting the working people.

	A worker from the Podolsk Mechanized Engineering Management Bureau angrily denounced the director of the enterprise, Surga, saying, “There isn’t a day when he doesn’t curse or insult the workers,” and “Anyone who dares to contradict him or express their own opinion is always reprimanded by him: ‘If you don’t want to work, I’ll fire you.’”

	Another worker from the same enterprise revealed, “During Surga’s tenure, almost all the old employees were fired.” The enterprise’s total staff is 350 people, but during Surga’s three-year tenure, 318 workers were arbitrarily fired.

	The leaders of the Korosten Railway Division retaliated against the old engineer Kireyev for opposing the theft of sleepers. Some accused him of “committing grave crimes and slandering the leadership.” Others openly shouted, “Kireyev doesn’t let us work in peace… as if the sleepers were something special.” Thus, the heads of this railway division found various excuses to give the old engineer Kireyev, who had worked there for over twenty years, “warnings” and “subsequent punishments,” demoted his position, and finally fired him.

	According to Soviet revisionist publications, in the Lithuanian SSR, in cities like Vilnius, Kaunas, Klaipeda, and districts like Valena, Vilnius, and Kapsukas, the phenomenon of arbitrarily firing workers is “most widespread,” and workers are arbitrarily punished and treated rudely, especially young workers and women.

	A member of the “Soyuz” collective farm in Khislavichi, Smolensk Oblast, exposed how the chairman of the farm, Korzakov, brazenly extorted and swindled the laboring farmers. Korzakov “arrogantly issued orders, and fines rained down on the members. He would fine them on the spot. Sometimes he would post notices: So-and-so and So-and-so are fined so many labor days or fifteen rubles, twenty rubles, twenty-five rubles… Often, when you go to collect your money, it has been deducted for no reason.”

	This farm chairman is a “lawless person.” For example, after the combine harvester, people would go to the fields to pick up the fallen grain husks, which were plowed into the soil or left to rot in the fields. However, the farm chairman would insult those who picked up the grain husks and “burn them.” “The members watched as things were destroyed but couldn’t make good use of them.”

	According to Soviet revisionist publications, in many rural areas of the Soviet Union, “those who criticized the farm chairman risked not having firewood for the winter or hay for the cows.”

	The reactionary policies of the Brezhnev and Kosygin clique to restore capitalism at home have been strongly condemned by the broad masses of the Soviet people. The immense indignation of the oppressed and exploited working people will inevitably develop into a raging revolutionary fire, burning down the reactionary rule of the Soviet revisionists.

    苏修特权阶层是苏联劳动人民的死对头
    他们对工人任意解雇打击报复敲诈勒索激起广大群众强烈愤怒
    新华社十三日讯　莫斯科消息：在勃列日涅夫、柯西金叛徒集团的统治下，苏联城乡的资产阶级特权阶层日益残暴地对劳动人民实行压迫和剥削。
    波多尔斯克机械化工程管理处一位工人，愤怒地控诉这个企业的主任苏尔加“没有一天不谩骂工人或加以侮辱”，“凡是想反驳他，或者是表示自己看法的人，总是被他这样训斥：‘不想干，我就把你解雇’。”
    这个企业的另一位工人揭露说，“在苏尔加任职期间，差不多所有的老工作人员都被解雇了”。这个企业的编制总共是三百五十人，在苏尔加任职的三年期间被蛮横解雇的工人达三百一十八人。
    科罗斯坚铁路分局的领导人由于老工程师基列夫反对盗窃枕木，便对他“发泄愤怒”，进行迫害。有的指责他“罪大恶极，诽谤领导人”。有的公然叫嚷，“基列夫不让人安宁工作……枕木好象真了不起似的”。于是，这个铁路分局的头头便寻找种种借口，给予在这里工作二十多年的老工程师基列夫以“警告处分”和“跟着而来的其他处分”，降低他的职务，最后把他解雇。
    据苏修报刊透露，在立陶宛加盟共和国的维尔纽斯市、考那斯市、克莱佩达市以及瓦列纳区、维尔纽斯区和卡普苏克斯区等地，无理解雇工人的现象“最为普遍”，并且任意处罚工人及粗暴对待少年和女工。
    斯摩棱斯克州希斯拉维契“联盟”农庄一位庄员，揭露这个农庄的主席科尔扎科夫猖狂地对劳动农民进行敲诈勒索。科尔扎科夫“粗暴地发号施令，罚款纷纷落到庄员头上。动辄就罚款。有时贴出这样的布告：某某和某某被罚款多少劳动日定额，或者十五卢布，二十卢布，二十五卢布……往往有这样的情况：你去领钱，而钱却不知为什么被扣除了。”
    这个农庄主席是一个“任意胡作非为的人”。例如，人们在康拜因收割后到田间拾取落下来的谷壳，这些谷壳被翻耕在土下，或者就丢在地里浪费掉。但是农庄主席却对拾谷壳的人进行侮辱，并且“把拾得的谷壳烧掉”。“庄员们眼看着东西被毁，却不能作有利处置。”
    据苏修报刊透露，在苏联的许多农村，“批评了农庄主席的人，就要冒没有过冬用的劈柴和没有奶牛吃的干草的危险”。
    勃列日涅夫、柯西金集团在国内复辟资本主义的倒行逆施，受到苏联广大群众的强烈谴责。被压迫和被剥削的劳动人民的无比愤慨，必将发展成为熊熊的革命烈火，焚毁苏修的反动统治。
