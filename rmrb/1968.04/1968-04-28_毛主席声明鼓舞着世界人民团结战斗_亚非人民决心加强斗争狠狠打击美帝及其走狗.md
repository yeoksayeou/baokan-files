Chairman Mao's declaration is inspiring the world's people to unite and fight. The people of Asia and Africa are determined to intensify their struggle and give a heavy blow to U.S. imperialism and its lackeys.

The Correct Path

Japan

The chairman of the Osaka Prefectural Committee of the Japan Asia-Africa People's Solidarity Committee, Yamamoto Sho-hachi, recently said in a speech that Chairman Mao's declaration summarized the revolutionary struggle experience of the people of the whole world, and pointed out the most correct path for the world's people in their struggle for liberation. The world's people must unite and launch a sustained and fierce offensive against U.S. imperialism and its accomplices, in order to deal the heaviest blow to the enemy and achieve thorough liberation.

Yamamoto said, Chairman Mao teaches us: "The enemy will not perish of itself." "All reactionaries are paper tigers. In appearance, the reactionaries are terrifying, but in reality they are not so powerful. From a long-term point of view, it is not the reactionaries but the people who are really powerful." He said, if the Japanese people do not give a heavy blow to U.S. imperialism, it will never roll out of Japan of its own accord; if they do not give a heavy blow to the Japanese reactionaries, they will never retire from the historical stage of their own accord; if they do not give a heavy blow to the revisionist group of the Japanese Communist Party led by Kyuemon, it will never perish of itself.

He said, in today's world, no one has ever been able to point out the direction for the world's people to advance as far-sightedly as Chairman Mao. Chairman Mao's great declaration will forever inspire and encourage all the oppressed nations and peoples of the world.

Great Support

Sri Lanka

Assistant Secretary of the Trade Union Federation, Shafi, said to a Xinhua News Agency reporter on the 24th that Chairman Mao's declaration inspires and encourages the laboring masses and oppressed peoples of the whole world, especially the struggle of the black people in the United States. He said, the great leader Chairman Mao has always supported the struggle of the oppressed and exploited peoples.

Some Sri Lankan friends who studied Chairman Mao's works together issued a joint statement on the 22nd, pointing out that Chairman Mao's declaration is a great support for the liberation struggle of the oppressed peoples of the whole world. The statement said: "Chairman Mao's declaration is a heavy blow to U.S. imperialism, the Soviet revisionist leading clique, and their lackeys." The statement pointed out that the great, invincible Mao Zedong Thought is shining like the sun over the whole world, and the people of the world are awakening. At this time, Chairman Mao issued this declaration, which is a great encouragement and support for the struggle of the oppressed peoples of the whole world. The statement expressed its resolute response to Chairman Mao's call and wished the great leader Chairman Mao longevity!

Great Inspiration

Senegal

A student named Ibrahim from Dakar wrote a letter to a Xinhua News Agency reporter, saying that Chairman Mao's declaration made us understand that we must use revolutionary violence to oppose counter-revolutionary violence. This scientific truth of Marxism-Leninism is not only a great inspiration to the tens of millions of black people in the United States who are struggling against exploitation, oppression, and slavery, and fighting for freedom and liberation; it is also a great inspiration to the oppressed peoples and nations of Asia, Africa, Latin America, and other countries in the world who are suffering from the oppression of imperialism, old and new colonialism, and the reactionaries of various countries.

    毛主席声明鼓舞着世界人民团结战斗
    亚非人民决心加强斗争狠狠打击美帝及其走狗
    正确的道路
    日本
    亚非人民团结日本委员会大阪府总部理事长山本庄八最近发表谈话说，毛主席的声明总结了全世界人民的革命斗争经验，给世界人民争取解放的斗争指出了最正确的道路。世界人民只有团结起来，向着美帝国主义及其帮凶们发动持久的猛烈的进攻，才能最沉重地打击敌人，才能取得彻底解放。
    山本说，毛主席教导我们：“敌人是不会自行消灭的。”“凡是反动的东西，你不打，他就不倒。这也和扫地一样，扫帚不到，灰尘照例不会自己跑掉。”他说，日本人民如果不狠狠地打击美帝国主义，它就绝对不会自己从日本滚出去；如果不狠狠地打击日本反动派，它也照样不会自行退出历史舞台；如果不狠狠地打击日共宫本修正主义集团，它也绝不会自行消灭。
    他说，在今天的世界上，从来还没有一个人能象毛主席这样高瞻远瞩地给世界人民指出前进的方向。毛主席的这个伟大声明，将永远鼓舞和激励着全世界被压迫民族和被压迫人民。
    巨大的支持

    工会联合会助理书记沙菲二十四日对新华社记者说，毛主席的声明激励和鼓舞着全世界劳动群众和被压迫人民，特别是美国黑人群众的斗争。他说，伟大领袖毛主席一贯支持被压迫、被剥削人民的斗争。
    一些在一起学习毛主席著作的锡兰朋友二十二日联合发表声明指出，毛主席的声明是对全世界被压迫人民的解放斗争的巨大支持。声明说：“毛主席的声明是对美帝国主义、苏联修正主义领导集团以及它们的走狗的沉重打击。”声明指出，伟大的、战无不胜的毛泽东思想象阳光普照着全世界，世界人民正在觉醒。在这样的时候，毛主席发表了这个声明，这是对全世界被压迫人民的斗争的巨大鼓舞和支持。声明表示坚决响应毛主席的号召，并祝愿伟大领袖毛主席万寿无疆！
    巨大的鼓舞
    塞内加尔
    一位名叫易卜拉欣的达喀尔学生写信给新华社记者说，毛主席的声明使我们懂得，必须以革命的暴力反对反革命的暴力。这一马克思主义的科学真理，不仅对于正在为反对剥削、压迫和奴役，争取自由和解放而斗争的千百万美国黑人，是巨大的鼓舞；而且对于遭受帝国主义、新老殖民主义和各国反动派迫害的亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲以及世界各国被压迫人民和民族来说，也是巨大的鼓舞。　（据新华社）
