    Some members of the Revolutionary Committee of the Qingdao Electric Machine Factory rode public bicycles for personal matters. The masses raised criticisms, and the committee members held a serious discussion on the issue of mixing public and private affairs. They unanimously agreed:

    The supervision of revolutionary masses is excellent

    A few days ago, a big-character poster was put up outside the Revolutionary Committee of the Qingdao Electric Machine Factory, raising what seemed to be a trivial issue: “Members of the Revolutionary Committee ride public bicycles for personal matters. What kind of thinking is this?” The poster was signed by the “Troops Who Love to Mind Other People’s Business.”

    As soon as the big-character poster was put up, the masses discussed it heatedly, waiting to see what the leaders of the Revolutionary Committee would do. The director of the Revolutionary Committee, militia representative Xu Fengming, and the deputy director Wang Jianzhi immediately wrote and posted big-character posters: “The troops who love to mind other people’s business are doing a good job!” and “Firmly support the correct opinion of the troops who love to mind other people’s business!” Many standing committee members and committee members also successively posted big-character posters praising the revolutionary actions of the revolutionary masses.

    Xu Fengming realized that the masses could supervise the leadership so seriously, indicating that the great thought of Mao Zedong had been grasped by the broad masses. This is a great achievement of the Cultural Revolution, a matter related to whether the entire leading cadre can proceed in the correct direction as indicated by Chairman Mao. Therefore, Xu Fengming decided to convene a full committee meeting to, based on Chairman Mao’s brilliant directive of “fighting the self and criticizing revisionism,” clean up the dust of the “self” in everyone’s mind.

    The committee members held a serious discussion on the issue of mixing public and private affairs.

    Some said: Mixing public and private affairs is to harm the public for personal gain. Is it for the public or for the self? Is it for oneself or for the revolution? These are two fundamentally opposed worldviews of the bourgeoisie and the proletariat. Some said: The “self” in the mind is a great enemy of the revolution, the source of revisionism. The struggle between public and private is a life-and-death class struggle without gunfire.

    Everyone agreed: Only by uprooting the old roots of the “self” can the communist thought of serving the public wholeheartedly be fundamentally established, turned into one’s soul, and become one’s action.

    After the meeting, the committee members who used public bicycles immediately returned the bicycles to the production command department and collectively formulated a new management and use system. This incident made the committee members deeply feel that the supervision of revolutionary masses is a reliable guarantee for preventing minor issues from becoming major ones and ensuring that the revolutionary government will never change color.

    青岛电机厂革委会有的委员骑公家自行车办私事，群众提出了批评，委员们针对公私不分问题展开了一场严肃讨论，一致认为：
    革命群众的监督好得很
    前几天，青岛电机厂革委会门外，贴出了一张大字报，提出了一个似乎是微不足道的小问题：“革委会的委员骑着公家的自行车办私事，这是什么思想？”署名是：“爱管闲事战斗队”。
    大字报一贴出，群众议论纷纷，等着看革委会的负责人怎么办？革委会主任、民兵代表徐风鸣，副主任王建志立即分别写出了“爱管闲事战斗队的闲事管得好！”
  “坚决支持爱管闲事战斗队的正确意见！”的大字报。许多常委、委员也相继贴出了为革命群众的革命行动叫好的大字标语。
    徐风鸣认识到，群众能够这样认真地监督领导，说明了伟大的毛泽东思想已被广大群众所掌握，这是文化大革命的伟大成果，是关系到整个领导班子能否沿着毛主席指引的正确航向前进的问题。因此，徐风鸣决定召开一次全体委员会议，根据毛主席“要斗私，批修”的光辉指示，清扫一下每个人头脑里“私”字的灰尘。
    委员们针对“公”“私”不分的问题，展开了一场严肃的讨论。
    有的说：“公”“私”不分，就是损公利私。为“公”还是为“私”，为自己还是为革命，是资产阶级和无产阶级的两种根本对立的世界观。有的说：头脑里的“私”字，是革命的大敌，是修正主义的发源地，“公”与“私”的斗争，是没有枪声的你死我活的阶级斗争。
    大家一致认为：只有把“私”字的老根拔掉，才能把一心为公的共产主义思想从根本上树立起来，化为自己的灵魂，变成自己的行动。
    会后，用公家车子的委员立即把车子交回生产指挥部，并集体制订了新的保管使用制度。这件事使委员们深深地体会到，革命群众的监督，是防微杜渐，使革命政权永不变色的可靠保证。
