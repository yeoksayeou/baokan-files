We must not relax our vigilance. The revolutionary cadres of the General Logistics Department of the People's Liberation Army

At the time of celebrating the birth of the Revolutionary Committee of Hunan Province, the *People's Daily* and the *PLA Daily* published the editorial *The Sun Rises Over the Land of Hibiscus*, conveying the latest instructions from our great leader Chairman Mao. Chairman Mao's latest instructions most profoundly, scientifically, and deeply elucidate the essence of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, pointing out the fundamental direction for carrying the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end.

As early as the eve of the founding of the People's Republic of China, our great leader Chairman Mao warned us: "The imperialists and domestic reactionaries will not readily accept their defeat. They will make their last struggle. Even after the country is pacified, they will continue to engage in sabotage and disruption in various ways, attempting to restore their power in China every day and every moment. This is inevitable and undeniable. We must not relax our vigilance." The history of class struggle in our country over the past eighteen years fully proves the correctness of Chairman Mao's brilliant and great judgment. The handful of traitors, spies, and unrepentant capitalist-roaders who have infiltrated the Party, with China's Khrushchev as their leader, are actually agents of the Kuomintang. They have been colluding with the remnants of the Kuomintang reactionaries without stopping for a single day, continuously attacking the proletariat. At the beginning of the founding of the country, they vigorously advocated "consolidating the new democratic order," fiercely opposing Chairman Mao's general line for the transitional period, and sabotaging the "one transformation, three changes"; they advocated the "four freedoms," trying to lead New China down the capitalist road. After the basic completion of socialist transformation, they propagated the theory of the "extinction of class struggle," advocating "class cooperation," and taking advantage of the Party's rectification, they launched a fierce attack on the Party, attempting to overthrow the leadership of the Communist Party and subvert the dictatorship of the proletariat. During the three years of temporary economic difficulties, they collaborated with the imperialists, revisionists, and reactionaries internationally to stir up a counter-revolutionary restoration tide, viciously attacking the Three Red Banners, spreading a black wind of rehabilitation, promoting the "three selfs and one package," and vigorously advocating the "three harmonies and one less," fully catering to the needs of the imperialists, revisionists, and reactionaries. All of this clearly shows that although the power of the Kuomintang reactionaries has been destroyed, their social base has not been completely eliminated.

In this unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the hundreds of millions of people in our country, under the brilliant leadership of Chairman Mao, have launched a general offensive against China's Khrushchev and all class enemies under his command, defeating them thoroughly and causing them to collapse completely. At present, the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has entered the stage of achieving comprehensive victory, and the doomsday of the class enemies has arrived. They will inevitably become more frantic in their desperate struggles.

We must redouble our revolutionary vigilance and redouble our awareness of the enemy, resolutely opposing right opportunism, right opportunist splittism, and right opportunist capitulationism, thoroughly smashing the counter-revolutionary evil wind of right opportunist rehabilitation. We must carry out a deeper revolutionary criticism, thoroughly criticizing and exposing the handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party led by China's Khrushchev, politically, ideologically, and theoretically, completely eliminating the remaining Kuomintang reactionaries, and resolutely, thoroughly, completely, and cleanly eliminating all class enemies, achieving comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

    我们务必不要松懈自己的警惕性
    解放军总后勤部机关无产阶级革命派
    在欢呼湖南省革命委员会诞生的时候，《人民日报》、《解放军报》发表了《芙蓉国里尽朝晖》的社论，传达了我们伟大领袖毛主席的最新指示。毛主席的这一最新指示，最精辟、最科学、最深刻地阐明了无产阶级文化大革命的实质，指明了将无产阶级文化大革命进行到底的根本方向。
    早在中华人民共和国成立前夕，我们伟大领袖毛主席就告诫我们：“帝国主义者和国内反动派决不甘心于他们的失败，他们还要作最后的挣扎。在全国平定以后，他们也还会以各种方式从事破坏和捣乱，他们将每日每时企图在中国复辟。这是必然的，毫无疑义的，我们务必不要松懈自己的警惕性。”我国十八年来阶级斗争的史实，完全证明了毛主席的这一英明伟大的论断。以中国赫鲁晓夫为首的混进党内的一小撮叛徒、特务、顽固不化的走资派，实际上就是国民党的代理人。他们同国民党反动派的残渣余孽勾结在一起，一天也没有停止过对无产阶级的进攻。在建国初期，他们竭力叫嚷“巩固新民主主义秩序”，疯狂反对毛主席提出的过渡时期的总路线，破坏“一化三改”；鼓吹“四大自由”，竭力把新中国引向资本主义的邪路。在社会主义改造基本完成以后，他们又宣扬“阶级斗争熄灭”论，鼓吹“阶级合作”，并乘我党整风的机会，猖狂向党进攻，妄图推翻共产党的领导，颠覆无产阶级专政。在三年暂时经济困难时期，他们配合国际上的帝、修、反，掀起了一股反革命复辟逆流，恶毒攻击三面红旗，大刮翻案黑风，大搞“三自一包”，大肆鼓吹“三和一少”，极力迎合帝、修、反的需要。所有这些，都清楚地说明：国民党反动派的政权虽然被我们摧毁了，但是他们的社会基础并没有扫除干净。
    在这次史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命中，我国亿万人民在伟大领袖毛主席的英明领导下，向中国赫鲁晓夫及其指挥的一切阶级敌人发起了一场总攻击，打得他们落花流水，全面崩溃。当前，无产阶级文化大革命进入到夺取全面胜利的阶段，阶级敌人的末日已经来临，他们必然愈加疯狂地进行垂死挣扎。
    我们一定要百倍地提高革命警惕性，百倍地加强敌情观念，坚决反对右倾保守主义、右倾分裂主义、右倾投降主义，彻底粉碎右倾翻案的反革命妖风。我们一定要更加深入地开展革命大批判，把以中国赫鲁晓夫为首的党内一小撮走资派，从政治上、思想上、理论上批倒批臭，把国民党反动残余连根铲除，把一切阶级敌人坚决、彻底、全部、干净地消灭掉，夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利。
