Chairman Mao recently instructed us: "The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is, in essence, a great political revolution carried out by the proletariat in the conditions of socialism, under the leadership of the Communist Party of China and the broad masses of the revolutionary people, to continue the long-term struggle against the Kuomintang reactionaries. It is the continuation of the class struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie."

Chairman Mao's latest directive most profoundly elucidates the great significance of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, most acutely reveals its class content; at the same time, it also thoroughly smashes the "class struggle extinction" theory propagated by the Chinese Khrushchev and the other major capitalist-roader within the Party.

Proletarian Dictatorship is not the end of class struggle, but the continuation of class struggle under new conditions.

At the historical turning point after the basic completion of the socialist transformation of the ownership of the means of production, Chairman Mao, with his genius, summed up the historical experience of the proletarian dictatorship, analyzed the contradictions, classes, and class struggles in socialist society, and clearly pointed out: After the basic completion of the socialist transformation of the ownership of the means of production, "class struggle has not ended. The class struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie, the class struggle between various political forces, the class struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie in the ideological sphere, will still be long-term, tortuous, and sometimes very intense." "There are still some people in society who dream of restoring the capitalist system, and they will fight against the working class from all aspects, including the ideological aspect." Therefore, the proletariat must engage in a long-term struggle against the bourgeoisie, especially on the political and ideological fronts, to carry the socialist revolution to the end.

The other major capitalist-roader within the Party, however, in collusion with the Chinese Khrushchev, vigorously advocates the "class struggle extinction" theory, fiercely opposing Chairman Mao's correct judgments. He blathers on about how "the previous period was revolutionary, but now the revolution is basically complete, and the task ahead is construction"; "class contradictions have basically been resolved"; "classes have basically been eliminated, so there is no need to emphasize class struggle." He repeatedly serves the bourgeoisie, revealing a despicable traitor's face!

Looking back at the history of the eighteen years since liberation, has there been a single year, month, or day when the class struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie has stopped? Has there been a single year, month, or day when the bourgeoisie's attacks on the proletariat have stopped? No, not a single day.

Facts speak louder than words: Just as the other major capitalist-roader within the Party was shouting "classes have basically been eliminated, so there is no need to emphasize class struggle," the bourgeois rightists launched a ferocious attack on the Party and socialism. "The tree wants to be still, but the wind will not cease." If you do not fight them, they will fight you. If you do not defeat them, they will defeat you. Over the past decade, the class struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie, especially the sharp and complex class struggle on the political and ideological fronts, has been unceasing and unabating, one battle after another.

Class struggle is a struggle to the death. Although the landlords and bourgeoisie have had their power seized and the means of production are no longer in their hands, they are still alive and their hearts are not dead. They will inevitably struggle and counterattack. The ideology and culture of the exploiting classes formed over thousands of years, and their influence, cannot be confiscated and will exist for a long time. The bourgeoisie still has considerable influence in the ideological and cultural sphere. They desperately use this influence to spread poison everywhere, using bourgeois "self-interest" to attack communist "public interest," corrupting people's souls, creating counter-revolutionary public opinion, and paving the way for the restoration of capitalism. They aim to "peacefully transform" the proletarian dictatorship into bourgeois dictatorship, or to seize power by force to restore their lost "paradise." Although they make up a very small proportion of the population, their political energy and resistance are much greater than their population proportion.

Chairman Mao teaches us that in the political and ideological sphere, the struggle between socialism and capitalism over who will prevail will take a very long time to resolve. It will not be resolved in a few decades but will take a hundred to several hundred years. Only by carrying the socialist revolution on the political and ideological front to the end, eliminating bourgeois ideology, establishing proletarian ideology, and making Mao Zedong Thought the banner, can we thoroughly revolutionize people's ideology. Only then can the proletariat consolidate its political and economic dominance and consolidate and develop the socialist system, transitioning to communism. If the proletariat does not carry out the revolution in the ideological sphere, allowing bourgeois ideology to spread unchecked, then the achievements of the twenty-eight-year New Democratic Revolution led by our Party and the achievements of the eighteen-year socialist revolution since liberation will all be in vain, destroyed in an instant. The restoration of capitalism in the Soviet Union and other socialist countries is a painful historical lesson.

The other major capitalist-roader within the Party, shouting "classes have basically been eliminated, so there is no need to emphasize class struggle," is attempting to lull the proletariat and revolutionary people into complacency, "extinguishing" the proletariat's struggle against the bourgeoisie, and covering up the bourgeoisie's attacks on the proletariat. This in itself is a form of class struggle. The characteristic of revisionism is to stand on the side of the bourgeoisie and attack the proletariat under the guise of denying classes and class struggle, turning the proletarian dictatorship into a bourgeois dictatorship. We must always remember Chairman Mao's teachings and "never forget class struggle."

The struggle between the two lines within the Party is the concentrated expression of the struggle between two classes and two roads.

The struggle between the two lines within the Party is the concentrated expression of the struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie, between socialism and capitalism. In our country, the struggle between the two lines within the Party is the struggle between the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao and the counter-revolutionary revisionist line advocated by the Chinese Khrushchev and the other major capitalist-roader within the Party.

The main target of the revolution under the conditions of proletarian dictatorship is the representatives of the bourgeoisie who have infiltrated the proletarian dictatorship apparatus, the handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party. The contradiction between this handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party and the broad masses of workers, peasants, soldiers, revolutionary cadres, and revolutionary intellectuals is the principal contradiction, an antagonistic contradiction. Resolving this contradiction is the concentrated expression of the struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie, between socialism and capitalism. The other major capitalist-roader within the Party, however, blathers on about how "the struggle between the two lines within the Party is not a struggle between socialism and capitalism but a struggle over methods," "that is, the issue of building socialism quickly or slowly." His first "methods" issue and second "quick or slow" issue both avoid discussing the class content and essence of the struggle between the two lines within the Party. Is this a coincidence? Absolutely not. This is a common trick used by the other major capitalist-roader within the Party and all revisionist counter-revolutionaries in their struggle against us, a smokescreen to cover up the bourgeoisie's attacks on the proletariat.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "Party struggles, in the period when classes exist, are the reflection of class contradictions within the Party." The handful of major capitalist-roaders within the Party are the agents of the bourgeoisie within the Party and state leadership organs. They are a group of counter-revolutionary revisionists who appear in disguise. Before national victory, they opposed the proletariat's seizure of power. After national victory, they opposed the proletarian dictatorship and the socialist revolution. They fiercely oppose Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, vigorously advocate the counter-revolutionary revisionist line, and dream of restoring capitalism. The fierce struggle between the two lines within the Party is the concentrated expression of the struggle between the two classes and two roads under the conditions of proletarian dictatorship.

The other major capitalist-roader within the Party blathers on about how the struggle between the two lines within the Party is a matter of "methods" and "speed" in building socialism, attempting to erase the class content and essence of the struggle between the two lines. This is utterly futile.

We must ask the other major capitalist-roader within the Party: Was the criminal activity of the Gao-Rao anti-Party alliance not a fierce opposition to the great leader Chairman Mao, an attempt to seize the leadership of the Party and state, sabotage the socialist revolution, and implement capitalism in China?

In 1957, did you not collude with the Chinese Khrushchev to viciously attack the socialist system, ranting about how the "proletarian dictatorship also has its dark side," claiming that "we are not as good as the bourgeoisie," and inciting bourgeois intellectuals to "curse every day"? Was this not a call for the bourgeoisie to rise up and launch a ferocious attack on the Party and socialism?

In 1959, did you not collude with the Chinese Khrushchev to support the great schemer, great ambitions, and great warlord Peng Dehuai in his ferocious attack on the Party? Was this not a dream of overthrowing the Party Central Committee led by Chairman Mao, attempting to put China on the revisionist track?

During the three years of temporary difficulties, did you not collude with the Chinese Khrushchev and all the ghosts and snakes, domestic and foreign, to viciously attack the Three Red Banners, vigorously advocate "self-reliance, self-management, and self-improvement," and spread the single-handed wind, saying things like "it doesn't matter if the cat is black or white, as long as it catches mice"? Was this not a ferocious attempt to restore capitalism?

The headquarters of the Chinese Khrushchev and his gang of the bourgeoisie have long been fiercely opposing Chairman Mao, Mao Zedong Thought, and Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, constantly plotting, dreaming of staging a counter-revolutionary coup, turning the proletarian dictatorship into a bourgeois dictatorship. Was this also a matter of "building socialism"?

Chairman Mao pointed out in 1959: "The struggle that took place at Lushan is a class struggle, a continuation of the life-and-death struggle between the two great antagonistic classes of the proletariat and the bourgeoisie in the past ten years of socialist revolution." Recently, Chairman Mao again instructed us that the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is a fierce class struggle, a continuation of the long-term struggle between the Communist Party of China and the broad masses of revolutionary people led by it and the Kuomintang reactionaries. The handful of major capitalist-roaders within the Party led by the Chinese Khrushchev and their agents in various fields represent the interests of the Kuomintang reactionaries, that is, the bourgeoisie and the landlords, rich farmers, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists. They have long been fiercely opposing Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, advocating the counter-revolutionary revisionist line, and dreaming of restoring capitalism. The difference is that the form of class struggle has changed. In the past, the Kuomintang reactionaries fought us with real guns and open fire, but now these people use more poisonous, more hidden, and more cunning methods to attack us. They and the Kuomintang reactionaries are birds of a feather, both aiming to overthrow the proletarian dictatorship and turn it into a bourgeois dictatorship. The other major capitalist-roader within the Party attempts to erase the class essence of the struggle between the two lines within the Party, dressing himself and his followers in a "building socialism" cloak to cover up their counter-revolutionary true colors. This is utterly futile.

To belittle the role of negative teachers is not to be a thoroughgoing materialist. The other major capitalist-roader within the Party, with such great effort to erase the class essence of the struggle between the two lines within the Party, precisely tells us from the opposite side that without the consciousness of line struggle and class struggle, it is abstract and incomplete, and it is impossible to carry out class struggle under the proletarian dictatorship and the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

Firmly strike down the rightist reversal wind, and actively and persistently attack the class enemy.

The law of the unity of opposites is the fundamental law of the development of things. Life is contradiction, life is struggle. Class struggle can never be resolved by compromise. Chairman Mao teaches us: "It is either the East Wind prevailing over the West Wind or the West Wind prevailing over the East Wind. There is no room for compromise on the issue of line." This is the fundamental guiding principle for us to carry out class struggle and line struggle. However, the other major capitalist-roader within the Party openly puts forward a set of logic of traitors and scoundrels to oppose Chairman Mao's instructions, allowing only the bourgeoisie to attack and not allowing the proletariat to counterattack. In 1957, he viciously attacked our Party's line struggle as "knocking down one batch of people and another batch rising up," "leaving endless troubles." He then jumped up with murderous intent to incite, saying: "If one batch of people can rise up to knock down another batch of people, then can't another batch of people rise up to knock down this batch of people?" This is extremely reactionary and vicious!

The other major capitalist-roader within the Party deliberately confuses the proletariat and the bourgeoisie, confuses the Communist Party and the Kuomintang reactionaries, shouting about "knocking down one batch of people and another batch rising up," depicting the struggle between the two lines within the Party as a factional struggle without principles. His intentions are poisonous, worse than snakes and scorpions. We carry out the struggle between the two lines within the Party to "knock down one batch of people" and "have another batch rise up." However, we do not do this based on factional principles but based on the fundamental interests of the proletariat, the fundamental interests of the Chinese revolution and the world revolution, based on the principle of supporting or opposing Chairman Mao, supporting or opposing Mao Zedong Thought, supporting or opposing Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. Those we want to knock down are not some other people but you, those stubborn capitalist-roaders, those traitors and spies, those ghosts and snakes. For you, this handful of bad people, we must root you out one by one, knock you down to the ground, and stomp on you with our feet, so that you can never rise again. If we do not knock you down, "the revolution will fail, the people will suffer, and the country will perish," and capitalism will be restored in China, and China and even the world will experience a great historical setback. Those we want to support are not some other people but the revolutionary cadres and outstanding elements among the revolutionary masses who firmly oppose you, who are infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao, infinitely loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, and infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. "All revolutionary struggles in the world are for seizing power and consolidating power." The leading cadre group is power. Our leading cadre groups at all levels must be composed of these people, and they must hold the proletarian reins of power. Only in this way can the proletarian dictatorship be consolidated and strengthened, and the socialist mountain will not change color.

"If class struggle, some classes win and some classes are eliminated. This is history, this is the history of several thousand years of civilization." If this is also called "knocking down one batch of people and another batch rising up," then we say, such actions are indeed very good, excellent. This is the need to consolidate the proletarian dictatorship in China and prevent the restoration of capitalism. We did this in the past, we do this now, and we will do this in the future.

What "endless troubles," this is purely malicious incitement. The struggle between the two classes, two roads, and two lines cannot be compromised. Our struggle with you, this handful of traitors, spies, and capitalist-roaders within the Party, is a struggle to the death. If we do not root you out completely, if we allow you to hide within the Party, hide within the revolutionary ranks, if we allow your counter-revolutionary plots to succeed, then the heads of thousands and thousands of people will roll, socialist China will once again become a semi-feudal, semi-colonial China, and the world revolutionary red base will become a black vassal state of imperialism. This is truly "endless troubles"! Digging out these time bombs buried within the Party is not "endless troubles" but removing hidden dangers, uprooting the source of evil, making the proletarian dictatorship more consolidated, and making the socialist cause develop more smoothly. The other major capitalist-roader within the Party's howls of "endless troubles" are both lamenting the fall of some of his accomplices and his own sense of impending doom. However, no matter how much they curse and threaten, or try to act harmless and pitiful, we will not be soft-hearted or pity them like poisonous snakes.

"What if one batch of people can rise up to knock down another batch of people, then can't another batch of people rise up to knock down this batch of people?" What kind of talk is this? This is a call for the Kuomintang reactionaries to return, a call for the landlords, rich farmers, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists to launch a counterattack, a call for the bourgeoisie to stir up trouble, a call for all the anti-Party elements who have been knocked down to overturn their cases and restore their positions. The other major capitalist-roader within the Party thinks he is very clever, very hidden, sometimes "this batch of people," sometimes "another batch of people." In fact, as long as we use the method of class analysis, his counter-revolutionary face will be revealed in the mirror of Mao Zedong Thought. He shouts for "another batch of people" to "knock down this batch of people," which is to spread the rightist reversal wind, openly summoning the handful of traitors, spies, and capitalist-roaders within the Party to collude with the ghosts and snakes in society to launch a ferocious counterattack, attempting to overthrow the proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao. Peeling off the other major capitalist-roader within the Party's mask, what remains is such a ferocious counter-revolutionary face.

"All reactionary forces, when they are about to perish, will inevitably make a desperate struggle." The closer the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is to complete victory, the more the counter-revolutionary forces will desperately struggle with the revolutionary forces. The current rightist reversal wind is to overturn the cases of the Chinese Khrushchev and the handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party, overturn the cases of the bourgeois reactionary line, and even overturn the cases of the rightists and the landlords, rich farmers, counter-revolutionaries, and bad elements. It directly opposes the proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin, opposes the People's Liberation Army, and sabotages the newly born revolutionary committees. It fundamentally negates the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and all previous political and ideological movements, negates the proletarian dictatorship. Their despicable methods are to wave the "red flag" to oppose the red flag, to play the counter-revolutionary two-faced game, to speak nicely to your face but to scheme behind your back. The root of this rightist reversal wind is the Chinese Khrushchev and the other major capitalist-roader within the Party. Now, although the Chinese Khrushchev and the other major capitalist-roader within the Party have been overthrown, they are not reconciled to their failure and are still making desperate struggles. We must deeply understand Chairman Mao's brilliant latest instructions, further raise our awareness of class struggle and line struggle, and currently be especially vigilant against rightist conservative thoughts, oppose factionalism and sectarianism, oppose rightist splitism and rightist capitulationism, oppose two-faced people, resolutely smash the rightist reversal wind, firmly follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, and launch active and persistent attacks on the Chinese Khrushchev and the other major capitalist-roader within the Party and the handful of counter-revolutionary revisionists, and on all class enemies, attack, attack, and attack again! We will not stop until we achieve complete victory!

    念念不忘阶级斗争，主动地持久地向阶级敌人进攻
    ——痛斥党内另一个最大的走资派“不应该强调阶级斗争”的反动谬论
    炮兵直属机关无产阶级革命派
    毛主席最近教导我们：“无产阶级文化大革命，实质上是在社会主义条件下，无产阶级反对资产阶级和一切剥削阶级的政治大革命，是中国共产党及其领导下的广大革命人民群众和国民党反动派长期斗争的继续，是无产阶级和资产阶级阶级斗争的继续。”
    毛主席这一最新指示，最深刻地阐明了无产阶级文化大革命的伟大意义，最精辟地揭示了无产阶级文化大革命的阶级内容；同时，也最彻底地粉碎了中国赫鲁晓夫和党内另一个最大的走资派之流鼓吹的“阶级斗争熄灭”论。
    无产阶级专政不是阶级斗争的结束，
      而是阶级斗争在新条件下的继续
    在我国生产资料所有制的社会主义改造基本完成以后的历史转折关头，毛主席天才地总结了无产阶级专政的历史经验，分析了社会主义社会的矛盾、阶级和阶级斗争，明确指出：在生产资料所有制的社会主义改造基本完成以后，“阶级斗争并没有结束。无产阶级和资产阶级之间的阶级斗争，各派政治力量之间的阶级斗争，无产阶级和资产阶级之间在意识形态方面的阶级斗争，还是长时期的，曲折的，有时甚至是很激烈的。”“社会上还有一部分人梦想恢复资本主义制度，他们要从各个方面向工人阶级进行斗争，包括思想方面的斗争。”因此，无产阶级必须同资产阶级进行持久的斗争，特别是在政治战线和思想战线上进行持久的斗争，把社会主义革命进行到底。
    党内另一个最大的走资派，却同中国赫鲁晓夫一唱一和，大肆鼓吹“阶级斗争熄灭”论，疯狂反对毛主席的英明论断。他胡说什么“前一段干的是革命，现在革命已经基本完成了，今后任务就是建设”；“现在阶级矛盾基本上解决了”；“阶级已经基本消灭了，就不应该强调阶级斗争”。他一再为资产阶级效劳，表现出一副可憎的叛徒嘴脸！
    回顾解放十八年来的历史，无产阶级和资产阶级之间的阶级斗争，有哪一年，哪一月，哪一天停止过呢？资产阶级向无产阶级的进攻，有哪一年，哪一月，哪一天停止过呢？没有，一天也没有。
    事实最有说服力：正当党内另一个最大的走资派叫嚷“阶级已经基本消灭了，就不应该强调阶级斗争”的时候，资产阶级右派就极其猖狂地向党向社会主义发动了一场进攻。“树欲静而风不止”。你不斗他，他要斗你。你不吃掉他，他要吃掉你。十多年来，无产阶级同资产阶级之间的阶级斗争，特别是在政治战线和思想战线上的尖锐复杂的阶级斗争，一场接着一场，从未间断，从未止息。
    阶级斗争是你死我活的斗争。虽然地主、资产阶级的印把子被夺过来了，生产资料不掌握在他们手里了，但是，他们人还在，心不死。他们必然要进行挣扎和反扑。几千年来形成的剥削阶级的思想文化及其影响，是无法没收的，将长时期存在。资产阶级在思想文化领域里还有相当的势力。他们拚命利用这种势力，到处放毒，用资产阶级的“私”字向共产主义的“公”字进攻，腐蚀人们的灵魂，制造反革命舆论，为复辟资本主义鸣锣开道，妄图把无产阶级专政“和平演变”为资产阶级专政，或者明火执仗地把政权夺过去，以便恢复他们已经失去的“天堂”。他们在整个人口中只占很少数，但是他们的政治能量和反抗力量，要比他们的人口比例大得多。
    毛主席教导我们，在政治思想领域内，社会主义同资本主义之间谁胜谁负的斗争，需要一个很长的时间才能解决。几十年内是不行的，需要一百年到几百年的时间才能成功。只有把政治思想战线上的社会主义革命进行到底，消灭资产阶级思想，树立无产阶级思想，以毛泽东思想挂帅，搞好人的思想革命化，无产阶级才能巩固自己在政治上和经济上的统治地位，才能巩固和发展社会主义制度，过渡到共产主义。如果无产阶级不搞意识形态领域里的革命，听任资产阶级思想泛滥，那么，我党领导下的二十八年新民主主义革命所取得的成果，解放十八年来社会主义革命所取得的成果，就会统统付之东流，毁于一旦。苏联和其他一些社会主义国家出现了资本主义复辟，就是一个沉痛的历史教训。
    党内另一个最大的走资派，叫嚷什么“阶级已经基本消灭了，就不应该强调阶级斗争”，就是妄图麻痹无产阶级和革命人民，“熄灭”无产阶级对资产阶级的斗争，掩护资产阶级向无产阶级进攻。这本身就是一种阶级斗争。修正主义的特点，就是在否认阶级和阶级斗争的名义下，站在资产阶级方面向无产阶级进攻，把无产阶级专政改变为资产阶级专政。我们一定要牢记毛主席的教导，“千万不要忘记阶级斗争”。
    党内两条路线的斗争，是两个阶级、
        两条道路的斗争的集中表现
    党内两条路线的斗争，是无产阶级和资产阶级两个阶级之间、社会主义和资本主义两条道路之间斗争的集中表现。在我国，党内两条路线的斗争，也就是以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线，同以中国赫鲁晓夫为代表的党内最大的一小撮走资派所推行的反革命修正主义路线的斗争。
    无产阶级专政条件下革命的主要对象，是混入无产阶级专政机构内部的资产阶级代表人物，是党内一小撮走资派。党内一小撮走资派同广大工农兵、革命干部、革命知识分子的矛盾，是主要的矛盾，是对抗性的矛盾。解决这个矛盾的斗争，是无产阶级和资产阶级两个阶级的斗争、社会主义和资本主义两条道路的斗争的集中表现。党内另一个最大的走资派，却胡说什么：党内两条路线斗争“不是社会主义与资本主义两条道路的斗争，而是方法的斗争”，“即建设社会主义快和慢的问题”。他前一个“方法”问题，后一个“快慢”问题，就是绝口不谈党内两条路线斗争的阶级内容和本质。这是偶然的吗？绝对不是。这是党内另一个最大的走资派，一切反革命修正主义分子同我们作斗争的一种惯用伎俩，是掩护资产阶级向无产阶级进攻的烟幕弹。
    毛主席教导我们：党内斗争，“在阶级存在的时候，这是阶级矛盾对于党内的反映。”党内最大的一小撮走资派，就是资产阶级在党和国家领导机关内部的代理人，他们是一批以伪装出现的反革命修正主义分子。全国胜利之前，他们反对无产阶级夺取政权。全国胜利之后，他们反对无产阶级专政，反对社会主义革命。他们疯狂反对毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，大力推行反革命修正主义路线，妄想复辟资本主义。党内两条路线的激烈的斗争，是无产阶级专政条件下两个阶级、两条道路斗争的集中表现。
    党内另一个最大的走资派，胡说什么党内两条路线斗争是“建设社会主义”的“方法”、“快慢”之争，妄图一笔抹煞两条路线斗争的阶级内容和本质，这完全是徒劳的。
    我们要问党内另一个最大的走资派：高饶反党联盟的罪恶活动，难道不是疯狂反对伟大领袖毛主席，妄图篡夺党和国家的领导权，破坏社会主义革命，在中国实行资本主义，而是为了“建设社会主义”吗？
    一九五七年，你伙同中国赫鲁晓夫，恶毒攻击社会主义制度，大讲“无产阶级专政”“也有阴暗面”，胡说我们“不如资产阶级”，鼓动资产阶级知识分子“天天骂娘”，难道这不是呼唤资产阶级鼓噪而出，向党向社会主义猖狂进攻，而是为了“建设社会主义”吗？
    一九五九年，你伙同中国赫鲁晓夫，支持大阴谋家、大野心家、大军阀彭德怀向党猖狂进攻，难道不是梦想推翻以毛主席为首的党中央领导，妄图把中国拉上修正主义的轨道，而是为了“建设社会主义”吗？
    在三年暂时困难时期，你伙同中国赫鲁晓夫和国内外一切牛鬼蛇神，恶毒攻击三面红旗，竭力鼓吹
  “三自一包”，大刮单干风，说什么“不管白猫、黑猫，只要抓住老鼠就是好猫”，如此等等，难道这不是猖狂地复辟资本主义，而是在“建设社会主义”吗？
    中国赫鲁晓夫和你们一伙的那个资产阶级司令部，长期以来，猖狂反对毛主席，反对毛泽东思想，反对毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，时刻蠢蠢欲动，梦想搞反革命政变，由无产阶级专政变为资产阶级专政，难道这也是在搞什么“社会主义建设”吗？
    毛主席在一九五九年明确指出：“庐山出现的这一场斗争，是一场阶级斗争，是过去十年社会主义革命过程中资产阶级与无产阶级两大对抗阶级的生死斗争的继续。”最近毛主席又教导我们，无产阶级文化大革命这场激烈的阶级斗争，同时也是中国共产党及其领导下的广大革命人民群众和国民党反动派长期斗争的继续。以中国赫鲁晓夫为首的党内最大的一小撮走资派及其在各个领域的代理人，代表了国民党反动派即资产阶级和地、富、反、坏、右的利益。他们长期以来，疯狂反对毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，推行反革命修正主义路线，妄想复辟资本主义。不同的是采取的阶级斗争形式变了。过去国民党反动派是真枪实弹、明火执仗地和我们较量，现在这些人则采取了更毒辣、更隐蔽、更狡猾的手段向我们进攻，他们和国民党反动派是一丘之貉，都是要颠覆无产阶级专政，变无产阶级专政为资产阶级专政。党内另一个最大的走资派，妄图抹煞党内两条路线斗争的阶级实质，给自己及其党羽穿上一件“建设社会主义”的外衣，以掩盖其反革命真相，这是绝对办不到的。
    轻视反面教员的作用，就不是一个彻底的辩证唯物主义者。党内另一个最大的走资派，如此煞费苦心地抹煞党内两条路线斗争的阶级实质，恰好从反面告诉我们，没有路线斗争观念，阶级斗争观念就是抽象的、不彻底的，就搞不好无产阶级专政下的阶级斗争，就搞不好无产阶级文化大革命。
    坚决打击右倾翻案妖风，不停顿地
        主动地向阶级敌人进攻
    对立统一规律是事物发展的根本规律。生活就是矛盾，生活就是斗争。阶级斗争从来是不能以调和的办法解决的。毛主席教导我们：“不是东风压倒西风，就是西风压倒东风，在路线问题上没有调和的余地。”这是我们进行阶级斗争和路线斗争的根本指导方针。但是，党内另一个最大的走资派，公然拿出一套工贼和叛徒的逻辑，同毛主席的指示相对抗，只许资产阶级进攻，不许无产阶级反击。他在一九五七年就恶毒攻击我们党内的路线斗争是“打倒一批人，又一批人起来”，
  “后患无穷”。并且杀气腾腾地跳起来煽动说：“既然这一批人可以起来打倒另一批人，那末另一批人难道就不可以起来打倒这一批人吗？”真是反动透顶，恶毒至极！
    党内另一个最大的走资派故意混淆无产阶级和资产阶级的区别，混淆共产党和国民党反动派的区别，叫嚷什么“打倒一批人，又一批人起来”，把党内两条路线的斗争，描绘为无原则的宗派斗争，用心之毒，蛇蝎莫及。我们进行党内两条路线的斗争，是要“打倒一批人”，“一批人起来”的。但是，我们不是根据宗派的原则，而是以无产阶级的根本利益、中国革命和世界革命的根本利益为出发点的，是根据拥护还是反对毛主席，拥护还是反对毛泽东思想，拥护还是反对毛主席的无产阶级革命路线这样一个原则办事的。我们要打倒的，不是一批什么别的人，而是你们那些顽固不化的走资派，那些叛徒、特务，那些牛鬼蛇神。对于你们这样的一小撮坏人，我们就是要一个一个地揪出来，打翻在地，再踏上一只脚，叫你们永世不得翻身。不打倒你们，“革命就要失败，人民就要遭殃，国家就要灭亡”，资本主义就会在中国复辟，中国乃至世界就会出现历史的大倒退。我们要拥护起来的，也不是一批别的什么人，而是同你们进行坚决斗争的，无限忠于毛主席、无限忠于毛泽东思想、无限忠于毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的革命领导干部和革命群众中的优秀分子。“世界上一切革命斗争都是为着夺取政权，巩固政权。”领导班子就是政权。我们的各级领导班子，就是要由这些人来组成，就是要让他们执掌无产阶级的印把子。只有这样，无产阶级专政才能巩固和加强，社会主义江山才能不变颜色。
  “阶级斗争，一些阶级胜利了，一些阶级消灭了。这就是历史，这就是几千年的文明史。”如果说这也叫做“打倒一批人，又一批人起来”的话，那末我们就要说，这样的举动，实在是好得很，好极了。这是在中国巩固无产阶级专政、防止资本主义复辟的需要。我们过去这样做，现在这样做，将来还要这样做。
    什么“后患无穷”，纯粹是居心恶毒的煽动。两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的斗争是不能调和的。我们同你们这些混入党内的一小撮叛徒、特务、走资派的斗争是你死我活的斗争。如果不把你们统统揪出来，如果让你们隐藏在党内，隐藏在革命队伍内，如果让你们的反革命阴谋得逞，千百万人头就要落地，社会主义的中国就要重新沦为半封建半殖民地的中国，世界革命的红色根据地就要沦为帝国主义的黑色附庸国。这才真正是“后患无穷”！挖掉你们这些埋藏在党内的定时炸弹，绝不是什么“后患无穷”，而是去掉了隐患，铲除了祸根，使无产阶级专政更加巩固，使社会主义事业更顺利地发展。党内另一个最大的走资派发出“后患无穷”的嚎叫，既是为他的一些同伙倒台喊冤叫屈，也是他预感自己的末日来临的哀鸣。但是不论他们咒骂恐吓也好，或者竭力装作无害而且可怜的样子也好，我们对他们决不会手软，决不会怜惜象毒蛇一样的恶人。
      “既然这一批人可以起来打倒另一批人，那末另一批人难道就不可以起来打倒这一批人吗？”这是什么话？这是呼唤国民党反动派卷土重来的黑话，这是策动地富反坏右分子反攻倒算的黑话，这是鼓动资产阶级兴风作浪的黑话，这是呼喊一切被打倒的反党分子翻案复辟的黑话。党内另一个最大的走资派自以为很聪明，自以为很隐蔽，一会儿“这一批人”，一会儿“另一批人”。其实，只要用阶级分析的方法加以分析，他的反革命嘴脸就会在毛泽东思想的照妖镜下显现原形。他叫嚣“另一批人”起来“打倒这一批人”，就是大刮右倾翻案妖风，公开召唤混入党内的一小撮叛徒、特务、走资派，勾结社会上的牛鬼蛇神疯狂反扑，妄图搞垮以毛主席为首的无产阶级司令部。剥去党内另一个最大的走资派的画皮，剩下的就是这样一副狰狞的反革命面孔。
      “一切反动势力在他们行将灭亡的时候，总是要进行垂死挣扎的。”无产阶级文化大革命越接近全面胜利，反革命力量必然越要同革命力量作拚死的斗争。当前出现的一股右倾翻案妖风，就是要为中国赫鲁晓夫等党内一小撮走资派翻案，为资产阶级反动路线翻案，甚至为右派分子翻案，为地、富、反、坏分子翻案，直接反对以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部，反对中国人民解放军，破坏新生的革命委员会，从根本上否定无产阶级文化大革命和历次政治思想运动，否定无产阶级专政。他们采用的卑鄙手法是打着“红旗”反红旗，耍反革命两面派手段，当面说得好听，背后又在搞鬼。这个右倾翻案妖风的总根子就是中国赫鲁晓夫和党内另一个最大的走资派。现在，中国赫鲁晓夫和党内另一个最大的走资派虽然被打倒了，但是，他们决不甘心自己的失败，他们还在进行垂死的挣扎。我们一定要深刻领会毛主席光辉的最新指示，进一步提高阶级斗争和路线斗争的觉悟，当前要特别警惕右倾保守思想，反对山头主义和宗派主义，反对右倾分裂主义和右倾投降主义，反对两面派，坚决粉碎右倾翻案妖风，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，向中国赫鲁晓夫和党内另一个最大的走资派等一小撮反革命修正主义分子，向一切阶级敌人发起主动的持久的进攻，进攻，再进攻！不获全胜，决不收兵！
