Red flags wave on the peaks of Liupan Mountain, billowing in the west wind. Under the brilliant guidance of Chairman Mao's latest instructions, the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region Revolutionary Committee has been born in victory.

On April 10, 100,000 military and civilian personnel in Yinchuan held a grand celebration rally. They resolved to remember Chairman Mao's teaching, "Never forget class struggle," to recognize the new situation of class struggle, and to launch unceasing attacks on the class enemy. They will resolutely oppose rightist conservatism, rightist factionalism, and rightist capitulationism, smash the rightist wind of reversing verdicts, and root out all traitors, spies, diehard capitalist-roaders, and all counter-revolutionaries, seizing complete victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

Xinhua News Agency, Yinchuan, April 11 -- "Red flags wave on the peaks of Liupan Mountain, billowing in the west wind." Just as the Revolutionary Committee has been established in the great leader Chairman Mao's hometown of Hunan Province, joyous news has come from the foot of Liupan Mountain, where Chairman Mao led the Red Army in a victorious crossing during the Long March: the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region Revolutionary Committee has been born in victory! This is another great victory for the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, another great victory for Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line!

Thirty-two years ago, our great leader Chairman Mao led the Red Army in a victorious crossing of the last high mountain on the Long March -- Liupan Mountain, writing a magnificent poem: "The sky is high and the clouds are thin, the southbound geese are out of sight. Until one reaches the Great Wall, one is not a hero. Counting the journey, it is 20,000 li. On the peaks of Liupan Mountain, red flags billow in the west wind. Today, the long whip is in hand, when will the dragon be captured?" Chairman Mao's great revolutionary practice and brilliant poetry have greatly inspired and given boundless strength to the revolutionary people of Hui and Han nationalities in Ningxia. In every critical moment of the fierce struggle between the two classes, the two roads, and the two lines, and in the unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the great leader Chairman Mao has always timely pointed out the direction for the revolutionary people of Ningxia. Under Chairman Mao's intimate care and the guidance of his latest instructions, the proletarian revolutionary masses, revolutionary Red Guards, and revolutionary people of all nationalities in the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region, have raised high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, closely followed Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, launched a powerful and fierce attack on China's Khrushchev and his agents in Ningxia, Yang Jingren and Ma Yushan, and other capitalist-roaders within the Party, repulsed their fierce counterattacks, seized back the power they had usurped, and achieved decisive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in Ningxia.

The glorious birth of the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region Revolutionary Committee has greatly consolidated and strengthened the proletarian dictatorship in Ningxia, bringing the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in Ningxia into a new stage.

The broad cadres and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army stationed in Ningxia and the Ningxia Military Region have resolutely responded to the great leader Chairman Mao's call to "support the leftist broad masses," using the great Mao Zedong Thought to propagate among the masses, organize the masses, and arm the masses. They have made outstanding contributions and achieved great successes in the "three supports and two militaries" work in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

Currently, the situation of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in Ningxia is excellent and getting better. From the banks of the Yellow River to the foot of Liupan Mountain, a new high tide of the mass movement to study and apply Mao Zedong Thought is surging, Mao Zedong Thought study classes are spreading throughout cities and countryside, Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line is deeply rooted in the hearts of the people of all nationalities, and the revolutionary people of all nationalities have never been as spirited as they are today. The movement to seize the revolution and promote production is reaching new heights.

On April 10, in the capital of the autonomous region, Yinchuan, red flags fluttered and drums beat. Hundreds of thousands of proletarian revolutionary masses from all fronts, revolutionary people of all nationalities, and soldiers and officers of the People's Liberation Army from all directions, carrying high the giant portrait of Chairman Mao and holding red copies of "Quotations from Chairman Mao," surged towards Nanmen Square to celebrate the victorious birth of the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region Revolutionary Committee.

The celebration rally began with the majestic melody of "The East is Red." When the rally solemnly announced the formal establishment of the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region Revolutionary Committee, the entire venue erupted in thunderous applause and joyous cheers. People excitedly raised their arms and shouted, "Long live the invincible Mao Zedong Thought! Long live Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line! Long live the great, glorious, and correct Communist Party of China! Long live the great leader Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years! Ten thousand times ten thousand years! Wish Chairman Mao eternal life! Eternal life!"

At the celebration rally, Comrade Kang Jianmin, Chairman of the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region Revolutionary Committee, delivered a speech. He said, "We must forever be loyal to Chairman Mao, forever loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, forever loyal to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, and raise higher the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought. We must more broadly and deeply carry out the great mass movement of studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought, further implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions, and seize complete victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution."

Comrade Kang Jianmin emphasized, "Chairman Mao recently taught us: 'The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is essentially a political revolution under socialist conditions, a continuation of the long struggle between the Communist Party and the reactionary Kuomintang led by the broad revolutionary masses, and a continuation of the class struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie.' The closer the Cultural Revolution is to complete victory, the more the enemies of the proletariat will play various tricks and make desperate struggles. We must firmly remember Chairman Mao's great teaching, 'Never forget class struggle.' We must continue to grasp the key of the struggle between the two classes, the two roads, and the two lines, launch unceasing attacks on the class enemy, closely follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, firmly grasp the direction of the struggle, mobilize the masses, and deeply and persistently carry out the great criticism, thoroughly expose the counter-revolutionary crimes of China's Khrushchev and other top capitalist-roaders within the Party and their agents in Ningxia, criticize and denounce them, and thoroughly eliminate their poison. He pointed out that the enemies of the proletariat always use rightist and ultra-leftist tactics, either alternately or simultaneously, to sabotage the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. We must recognize the new situation of class struggle, resolutely oppose rightist conservatism, rightist factionalism, and rightist capitulationism, smash the rightist wind of reversing verdicts, thoroughly expose traitors, spies, diehard capitalist-roaders, and all open or hidden counter-revolutionaries, and root them all out."

Comrade Kang Jianmin said, "Chairman Mao recently instructed us: 'The basic experience of the Revolutionary Committee is threefold: one is the representative of revolutionary cadres, one is the representative of the army, and one is the representative of revolutionary masses, realizing the three-in-one combination of the revolution. The Revolutionary Committee should implement unified leadership, break down redundant administrative organs, streamline and strengthen the organization, and form a revolutionary leadership cadre that is revolutionary, connected with the masses, and efficient.' Chairman Mao's brilliant instruction is the fundamental direction for building the Revolutionary Committee and an extremely powerful ideological weapon for seizing complete victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. We must seriously study, enthusiastically propagate, resolutely implement, and quickly put into practice, building the Revolutionary Committee into a revolutionary command post that is unconditionally loyal to the great leader Chairman Mao, revolutionary, connected with the masses, and efficient."

Comrade Kang Jianmin said, "All military and civilian personnel in the region must resolutely respond to Chairman Mao's great call to 'support the army and love the people,' deeply carry out the activities of supporting the army and loving the people, strengthen military-civilian unity, strengthen the proletarian dictatorship, guard against the sabotage and disruption by the spies of the U.S., the Chiang Kai-shek clique, the Soviet revisionists, the Mongolian revisionists, a small handful of unrepentant capitalist-roaders, and untransformed landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists, defend the great motherland, and defend the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. We must seriously implement Chairman Mao's great strategic policy of 'seizing the revolution and promoting production, work, and preparedness,' and seize victory in both revolution and production."

Comrade Zhang Huaili, Deputy Commander of the Ningxia Military Region and Vice Chairman of the Revolutionary Committee, and Comrade Xu Hongxue, Commander of the Leftist Support Group of the People's Liberation Army in Ningxia and Vice Chairman of the Revolutionary Committee, both spoke at the celebration rally. They unanimously pointed out that after the establishment of the Revolutionary Committee, the class enemy will inevitably make desperate struggles. The entire cadres and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army stationed in Ningxia and the Ningxia Military Region will firmly remember Chairman Mao's teaching, "The rights obtained by the people must not be easily lost and must be defended by struggle," and will enthusiastically support, firmly support, actively help, and bravely defend the newly born Revolutionary Committee, firmly maintain the proletarian authority of the Revolutionary Committee, and be the strong backbone of the Revolutionary Committee. They will guard against and smash the plots of the class enemy to shake and overthrow the Revolutionary Committee from the right or ultra-left, and defend the proletarian revolutionary power. They expressed their determination to further believe in and rely on the broad revolutionary masses, model the implementation of Chairman Mao's great call to 'support the army and love the people,' humbly learn from the masses, further do a good job of loving the people, strengthen military-civilian unity, and seize complete victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

Representatives of revolutionary workers, poor and lower-middle peasants, and revolutionary Red Guards in Ningxia all expressed at the celebration rally that they would, under the leadership of the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region Revolutionary Committee, raise higher the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, more broadly and deeply carry out the mass movement of studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought, closely follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, "criticize and repudiate revisionism," establish and run Mao Zedong Thought study classes, further implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions, continuously consolidate and develop the revolutionary great alliance and revolutionary three-in-one combination, do a good job of the great criticism and the struggle-criticism-transformation of their own units, further implement the great policy of 'supporting the army and loving the people' and 'seizing the revolution and promoting production,' and do a better job in all aspects, seizing complete victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

Representatives of the proletarian revolutionary masses of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region also spoke at the celebration rally, warmly congratulating the establishment of the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region Revolutionary Committee.

Those attending the rally also included Vice Chairmen Wang Zhiqiang and An Jianguo of the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region Revolutionary Committee, committee members, and responsible comrades of the Ningxia garrison.

    三十二年前，我们伟大领袖毛主席率领工农红军在这里胜利地跨越了长征途中最后一座高山——六盘山，写下了气壮山河的光辉诗篇：“天高云淡，望断南飞雁。不到长城非好汉，屈指行程二万。六盘山上高峰，红旗漫卷西风。今日长缨在手，何时缚住苍龙？”毛主席的伟大革命实践和光辉诗篇，给了宁夏的回族、汉族革命人民以巨大的鼓舞和无穷的力量。在两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线激烈斗争的每一个关键时刻，在史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命运动中，伟大领袖毛主席都及时地为宁夏革命人民指明了前进的航向。在毛主席的亲切关怀和一系列最新指示的指引下，宁夏回族自治区的无产阶级革命派、革命的红卫兵小将和各族广大革命群众，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，向中国赫鲁晓夫及其在宁夏的代理人杨静仁、马玉槐等党内一小撮走资派，发起了强大的、猛烈的进攻，击退了他们的猖狂反扑，夺回了被他们窃踞的权力，取得了宁夏无产阶级文化大革命的决定性胜利。
    宁夏回族自治区革命委员会的光荣诞生，大大地巩固和加强了宁夏的无产阶级专政，使宁夏的无产阶级文化大革命进入了崭新的阶段。
    人民解放军宁夏驻军和宁夏军区广大指战员，坚决响应伟大统帅毛主席的“人民解放军应该支持左派广大群众”的战斗号召，用伟大的毛泽东思想宣传群众、组织群众、武装群众，在无产阶级文化大革命“三支”“两军”工作中作出了卓越的贡献，取得了很大的成绩。
    目前，宁夏的无产阶级文化大革命形势大好，越来越好。从黄河两岸到六盘山麓，活学活用毛泽东思想的群众运动新高潮蓬勃兴起，毛泽东思想学习班遍及城乡各地，毛主席的无产阶级革命路线空前深入人心，各族革命人民从来没有象今天这样意气风发，抓革命、促生产出现了新的高潮。
    四月十日，在自治区的首府银川市，红旗招展，锣鼓喧天。宁夏全区各条战线的无产阶级革命派、各族革命群众和人民解放军指战员十万人，怀着无限忠于伟大领袖毛主席的深厚无产阶级感情，抬着毛主席的巨幅画像，手持红彤彤的《毛主席语录》，从四面八方涌向南门广场，隆重庆祝宁夏回族自治区革命委员会的胜利诞生。

    康健民同志强调说，毛主席最近教导我们：“无产阶级文化大革命，实质上是在社会主义条件下，无产阶级反对资产阶级和一切剥削阶级的政治大革命，是中国共产党及其领导下的广大革命人民群众和国民党反动派长期斗争的继续，是无产阶级和资产阶级阶级斗争的继续。”文化大革命越接近全面胜利，无产阶级的敌人总还是要玩弄各种阴谋诡计，进行垂死挣扎。我们一定要牢记毛主席
  “千万不要忘记阶级斗争”的伟大教导。我们一定要继续大抓两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的斗争这一个纲，不停顿地向阶级敌人展开进攻，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，牢牢掌握斗争大方向，放手发动群众，深入持久地开展革命大批判，把中国赫鲁晓夫等党内最大的一小撮走资派及其在宁夏的代理人的反革命罪行，揭深揭透，批倒批臭，彻底肃清他们的流毒。他指出，无产阶级的敌人总是交替使用或者同时使用右的和极“左”的两手，来破坏无产阶级文化大革命。我们一定要认清阶级斗争的新形势，坚决反对右倾保守主义、右倾分裂主义、右倾投降主义，粉碎右倾翻案妖风，彻底揭露叛徒、特务、顽固不化的走资派和一切公开的或隐蔽的反革命分子，把他们统统挖出来。
    康健民同志说，毛主席最近指示我们：“革命委员会的基本经验有三条：一条是有革命干部的代表，一条是有军队的代表，一条是有革命群众的代表，实现了革命的三结合。革命委员会要实行一元化的领导，打破重叠的行政机构，精兵简政，组织起一个革命化的联系群众的领导班子。”毛主席的这一光辉指示，是建设革命委员会的根本方向，是夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的无比强大的思想武器。我们一定要认真学习，热情宣传，坚决执行，迅速落实，把革命委员会建设成为无限忠于伟大领袖毛主席的、革命化的、联系群众的、精悍有力的革命战斗指挥部。
