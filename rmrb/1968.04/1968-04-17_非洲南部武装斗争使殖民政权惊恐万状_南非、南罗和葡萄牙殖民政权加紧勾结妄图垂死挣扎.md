Armed struggles in Southern Africa have struck fear into the hearts of colonial regimes. The colonial governments of South Africa, South Rhodesia, and Portugal have intensified their collusion in a desperate attempt to prolong their dying days.

According to a report from Xinhua News Agency on April 14, the colonial regimes of South Africa, South Rhodesia, and Portugal, with the support of American and British imperialism, have recently stepped up their military collaboration. They aim to jointly suppress and crush the armed struggles of the people in Zimbabwe, Mozambique, and Angola.

The Portuguese colonialists, under constant pressure from the guerrillas in Mozambique, Angola, and "Portuguese" Guinea, have found it increasingly difficult to maintain their rule over these vast colonial territories. The white colonial regime in South Rhodesia, which unilaterally declared "independence" at the end of 1965, is in a state of panic due to the recent offensive by the Zimbabwean guerrillas. Meanwhile, the apartheid regime in South Africa, backed by the United States and Britain, feels the flames of armed struggle burning closer and has frantically intervened to suppress the struggle in the region. Thus, these three white colonial regimes in Southern Africa, to maintain their colonial rule and the common interests of foreign monopoly capital in the region, formed an anti-revolutionary alliance last year. They secretly reached a "military agreement" to coordinate their counter-revolutionary armed forces and jointly suppress the burgeoning national liberation movements in Southern Africa.

After reaching the secret agreement, the South African colonial regime, which has greater military and economic strength, has continuously provided "military aid" and military advisors to South Rhodesia and Portugal. They have even directly sent troops to South Rhodesia to fight against the guerrillas.

Recently, due to the rapid development of the armed struggle in Zimbabwe, the terrified Smith colonial regime sought help from the Vorster colonial regime in South Africa. The Johannesburg Sunday Times acknowledged on April 7 that the South African authorities had decided to send more troops to reinforce their suppression forces in South Rhodesia.

According to the British Daily Mirror, in addition to providing money and other supplies to Portugal, the South African authorities have also provided military advisors, armed police forces, and 16 aircraft to help the Portuguese colonial authorities suppress the African guerrillas in Mozambique and Angola. It is also reported that in Mozambique, South African whites often fly Portuguese-marked aircraft for aerial patrols. The South African authorities have also sent helicopters to assist the Portuguese colonial authorities in reconnaissance against the Angolan guerrillas.

To suppress internal and national liberation movements in Southern Africa, the South African white colonial regime has been frantically expanding its military arsenal with the help of American and British imperialism. The South African authorities have used the largest military budget in history to import large quantities of aircraft, tanks, submarines, and other weapons from the West. They have also built their own arms factories to manufacture weapons and encouraged American and British arms companies to set up factories in South Africa to produce various weapons locally. It is reported that companies affiliated with the "De Beers Company" of American and British capital are building arms factories for the South African authorities. Other American and British companies have been continuously manufacturing military aircraft, military vehicles, and other military equipment in South Africa. American and British oil companies such as "Mobil" and "Shell" have also been supplying large quantities of oil, essential for colonial military suppression, to South Africa and South Rhodesia through South Africa, despite the embargo imposed by African and other countries on South Africa.

    非洲南部武装斗争使殖民政权惊恐万状
    南非、南罗和葡萄牙殖民政权加紧勾结妄图垂死挣扎
    据新华社十四日讯  南非、南罗得西亚和葡萄牙三个殖民政权，在美英帝国主义的支持下，最近在军事上加紧勾结，妄图在非洲南部共同遏制并镇压津巴布韦、莫三鼻给和安哥拉非洲人民的武装斗争。
    葡萄牙殖民主义者，在莫三鼻给、安哥拉、“葡属”几内亚游击队的不断打击下，对这些幅员广大的殖民领土的统治已经力不从心，摇摇欲坠。在一九六五年年底片面宣布“独立”的南罗得西亚白人殖民政权，在津巴布韦游击队最近展开的攻势面前，惊慌失措。而在美英扶植和卵翼下的种族主义南非，由于感到武装斗争的烈火越烧越近，就疯狂插手镇压这一地区的武装斗争。就这样，这三个非洲南部的白人殖民政权，为了维护它们的殖民统治和外国垄断资本在这一地区的共同利益，在去年就组成了一个反革命同盟，秘密达成了“军事协议”，协调它们的反革命武装力量，共同镇压非洲南部地区蓬勃发展的民族解放运动。
    在达成秘密协议后，军事和经济实力较大的南非殖民政权，就不断向南罗得西亚和葡萄牙提供军事“援助”、军事顾问，甚至直接出兵到南罗得西亚同游击队作战。
    最近，由于津巴布韦人民武装斗争迅猛发展，惊恐万状的史密斯殖民政权又向南非沃斯特殖民政权求援。南非约翰内斯堡《星期日时报》四月七日承认，南非当局已经决定再派大批军队去增援它在南罗得西亚的镇压部队。
    据英国《每日镜报》透露，南非当局除了向葡萄牙提供金钱和其他供应品外，还提供军事顾问、武装警察部队和十六架飞机，帮助葡萄牙殖民当局镇压莫三鼻给和安哥拉的非洲游击队。另据报道，在莫三鼻给，南非白人经常驾驶涂着葡萄牙标志的飞机进行空中巡逻。南非当局还派出直升飞机协助葡萄牙殖民当局侦察安哥拉游击队的活动。
    为了镇压内部和非洲南部的民族解放运动，南非白人殖民政权几年来一直在美英帝国主义的帮助下拚命扩充军备。南非当局用历史上最大的军事拨款，一方面从西方进口大量飞机、坦克、潜水艇和其它武器，另一方面自己又修建军火工厂，制造军火，还鼓励美英军火公司在南非设厂，就地制造各种武器。据报道，美英资本的“德比尔斯公司”所属的公司，正在为南非当局建设军火工厂。而其它一些美英公司则一直在南非制造军用飞机、军用车辆和其它军需设备。美国和英国的“莫比尔”和“壳牌”等石油公司，还不顾非洲和其它国家对南非实行的禁运，一直向南非、并通过南非向南罗得西亚提供进行殖民军事镇压所不可缺少的大量石油。
