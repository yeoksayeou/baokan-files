		Holding study classes is a good method; many problems can be solved in study classes.		Mao Zedong

		Lan Kiao Nan Ma Zhuang Brigade, based on the scattered living conditions of the rural areas, conducts extensive study classes to promote Mao Zedong Thought education among the members. Over 95% of the members and cadres regularly participate in the study classes. They say: "After joining the study class, studying the works of Chairman Mao, our eyes are clearer, and our hearts are brighter. We only want to follow Chairman Mao in revolution. The study class is good; we will continue it forever."

		According to a report from our newspaper, the Nan Ma Zhuang Brigade of San Yi Zhai People's Commune in Lan Kiao County, Henan Province, has mobilized members living nearby to jointly hold Mao Zedong Thought study classes, enabling over 95% of the members and cadres to regularly participate in the study. The class consciousness and line struggle consciousness of the broad masses of members and cadres have significantly improved, and they are more vigorously promoting revolution and production.

		The Nan Ma Zhuang Brigade has twelve production teams scattered across four natural villages. In October of last year, the revolutionary leading cadres and representatives of the revolutionary mass organizations of the brigade established a Mao Zedong Thought study class. At that time, due to the limitations of study time and location, the participants were mainly brigade and team cadres, representatives of revolutionary mass organizations, and poor and lower-middle peasants, which could not satisfy the strong desire of the broad masses, especially the elderly, women, and children, to join the study class. The poor and lower-middle peasants of the fifth production team of this brigade, with deep class feelings for the great leader Chairman Mao, voluntarily joined with a few neighboring households to establish a Mao Zedong Thought study class. The brigade revolutionary committee considered this to be a good form of popularizing the great Mao Zedong Thought and implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions under rural conditions, and immediately promoted their experience to various production teams.

		These study classes are composed of four or five, or six or seven neighboring households. Each study class elects one class leader and appoints one instructor. They are all active members of the poor and lower-middle peasants in studying Chairman Mao's works. The brigade leadership regularly trains them. The fundamental task of the study class is to criticize and repudiate revisionism and to arm the minds of the members with the invincible Mao Zedong Thought. The main content of the study is Chairman Mao's works and Chairman Mao's latest instructions, as well as important articles and editorials in newspapers. The general method of study is for the instructor to first read and explain to everyone, followed by a discussion. The study class particularly emphasizes cultivating the revolutionary study style advocated by Chairman Mao, which combines theory with practice. The students summarize their experiences as follows: "Chairman Mao's words must be memorized, and the essence must be understood. Study one sentence and apply one sentence, study one point and apply one point. Study diligently and often reflect, this is how to study well."

		Practice has proven that conducting study classes in this way has many advantages. First, it is close to home, convenient to come and go, and each study session is not very long, so not only cadres and young and middle-aged members can participate, but also the elderly, women with children, and children around ten years old can participate. In this way, the vast majority of the member masses are organized. Second, by gathering in the evening at the home of a member, it does not occupy production time and does not require a special study room. Third, the students include cadres and members, men and women, the elderly and youth, the literate and the illiterate, which facilitates mutual assistance and collective wisdom. Fourth, the students are all neighbors, familiar with each other, and understand each other well, which facilitates mutual assistance.

		The broad masses of members enthusiastically welcome this kind of study class. They say: "It's quick to gather, everyone arrives on time, the sound is clear, and the study is detailed. It's really a good way to study Chairman Mao's works." Since last November, the study classes in Nan Ma Zhuang Brigade have been held continuously for over four months. Every day, after dinner, the members bring their red "Quotations from Chairman Mao" and, leading the elderly and children, happily go to the study class. Once everyone is gathered, led by the class leader, they first sincerely wish the great leader Chairman Mao a long life, sing the loudest "East Is Red," and recite Chairman Mao's quotations or the latest instructions from Chairman Mao in unison. Then, everyone sits around the lamp, led by the instructor, and discusses the central issue, either studying Chairman Mao's works, discussing Chairman Mao's latest instructions, or criticizing Liu Shaoqi. Over the past four months, the spiritual outlook of the broad masses of members has undergone significant changes.

		The members of Nan Ma Zhuang Brigade regard the study class as an important battlefield for criticizing and repudiating revisionism. They often expose the manifestations of "self," investigate the harms of "self," and dig out the roots of "self" while studying the "Three Constantly Read Articles." They make "self" more and more stinky and regard "public" as the criterion for all actions. Formerly, team cadres who planned to shirk their responsibilities have become active in their work. Those who used to pick and choose light work have now taken on heavy responsibilities. Those who used to have heavy personal concerns now work wholeheartedly for the public good. Zhang Yinglin, a member of the fifth team, used to be very concerned about the number of work points. After studying the "Three Constantly Read Articles," he examined himself: "In the past, I only thought about earning more work points and did not care about state affairs and collective interests. This was the work of selfishness. In the future, I will listen to Chairman Mao's words, learn from Zhang Sidao and Bai Qiu'en, and serve the people wholeheartedly." Now, Zhang Yinglin always upholds the interests of the state and the collective and is known as "broad-minded."

		In the study class, the members of Nan Ma Zhuang repeatedly denounced and criticized Liu Shaoqi's series of counter-revolutionary revisionist fallacies, such as "exploitation has merits," "developing the rich peasant economy," "three autonomies and one contract," "material incentives," "suffering small losses to gain big benefits," etc., thereby greatly enhancing their consciousness of line struggle. The team leader of the sixth team, Geng Wenxuan, used to only focus on production and not emphasize politics. He thought: "As long as production is improved, everything will be fine." Through criticizing Liu Shaoqi, he realized: emphasizing politics or not emphasizing politics is a struggle between two lines. Not emphasizing politics not only fails to improve production but also leads to the capitalist road. From then on, he became active in studying Chairman Mao's works, and the team's production also showed significant improvements. Fu Jingtai, the livestock keeper of the fifth team, feeds twenty animals and earns twenty work points a day. In addition, he raised three young animals for the production team, and the team rewarded him with over one hundred yuan in cash. Previously, he did not think this was a problem. Through criticizing Liu Shaoqi, he could no longer sit still and found the team leader to say: "Giving me so many work points and rewarding me with cash is all influenced by Liu Shaoqi's fallacy of 'material incentives,' which does not conform to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. We need to change this. Work points should not be calculated based on the number of animals, and I will return all the cash rewards to the collective." From then on, Fu Jingtai fed the animals more diligently.

		The production of Nan Ma Zhuang Brigade has seen a new leap forward this winter and spring. In the continuous five-month battle of digging canals and leveling fields, regardless of wind or snow, the attendance rate has always been above 90%. Labor discipline is good, and every time they go to work, the members form a queue, holding red flags, singing revolutionary songs, and march vigorously towards the fields. During labor, there are few cases of tardiness, early departure, laziness, or trickery. A month's work, they completed in half a month; a ten-day work, they completed in five days.

		The members of Nan Ma Zhuang are increasingly feeling the benefits of holding study classes. They say: "In the past, without joining the study class and not studying Chairman Mao's works, we were always confused; after joining the study class and studying Chairman Mao's works, our eyes are clearer, and our hearts are brighter. We only want to follow Chairman Mao in revolution. The study class is good; we will continue it forever."

    办学习班，是个好办法，很多问题可以在学习班得到解决。					毛泽东
    兰考南马庄大队根据农村居住分散的特点大办学习班
    最广泛地向社员进行毛泽东思想教育
    全队百分之九十五以上的社员和干部经常参加学习。他们说：“进了学习班，一学习毛主席著作，眼也明了，心也亮了，只想跟着毛主席他老人家干革命。学习班就是好，我们要永远办下去。”
    本报讯　河南省兰考县三义寨公社南马庄大队，广泛发动居住邻近的社员联合办毛泽东思想学习班，使百分之九十五以上的社员和干部都能经常参加学习。广大社员和干部的阶级斗争觉悟和路线斗争觉悟大大提高，更加朝气蓬勃地抓革命促生产。
    南马庄大队共有十二个生产队，分散在四个自然村。去年十月间，大队革命领导干部和革命群众组织的负责人办起一个毛泽东思想学习班。当时，由于学习时间和学习地点的限制，参加的人主要是大队和生产队干部、革命群众组织负责人和贫下中农代表，不能满足广大群众，特别是老人、妇女和儿童进学习班的强烈愿望。这个大队的第五生产队的贫下中农，怀着对伟大领袖毛主席的深厚阶级感情，自动联合相邻的几户社员办起了毛泽东思想学习班。大队革委会认为这是在农村条件下普及伟大的毛泽东思想、落实毛主席最新指示的一种很好的形式，立即向各生产队推广了他们的经验。
    这种学习班是由邻近的四五户或六七户人家共同组成的。每个学习班选举班长一名，配备辅导员一名。他们都是贫下中农中学习毛主席著作的积极分子，大队领导班子定期对他们进行培训。学习班的根本任务是斗私批修，用战无不胜的毛泽东思想武装社员的头脑。学习内容主要是毛主席著作和毛主席最新指示，此外还有报纸上的重要文章和社论。学习方式一般是先由辅导员给大家朗读、讲解，然后展开讨论。学习班特别重视培养毛主席倡导的理论联系实际的革命好学风。学员们总结自己的体会是：“毛主席的话要记牢，精神实质领会好。学一句用一句，学一条用一条。用心学习多对照，这样才能学得好。”
    实践证明，这样办学习班有许多好处。第一，离家近，来去方便，每次学习时间又不很长，不但干部和青壮年社员可以参加，而且老年人、有孩子的妇女和十来岁的娃娃也都能够参加。这样，就把绝大多数社员群众都组织起来了。第二，利用晚上集中到一户社员家里学习，既不占用生产时间，也不需要专门的学习室。第三，学员中有干部有社员，有男的有女的，有老人有少年，有识字的有不识字的，便于互相帮助，集思广益。第四，学员们都是邻居，彼此朝夕相处，很熟悉，很了解，便于互相帮助。
    广大社员群众非常欢迎这种学习班。他们说：“集合快，到得齐，听得清，学得细，真是学习毛主席著作的好办法。”从去年十一月到现在，南马庄大队的这种学习班已经连续办了四个多月。每天，社员们一吃过晚饭，就带上红彤彤的《毛主席语录》，扶老携幼，高高兴兴地到学习班去学习。人一到齐，在班长的带领下，首先衷心祝愿伟大领袖毛主席万寿无疆，高唱最响亮的《东方红》，齐声背诵毛主席语录或毛主席最新指示。然后，大家围灯而坐，在辅导员的领导下，围绕着中心问题，或学习毛主席著作、或讨论毛主席最新指示、或批判中国赫鲁晓夫。四个多月来，广大社员的精神面貌发生了显著的变化。
    南马庄大队社员把学习班当作破私立公的重要战场。他们结合学习“老三篇”，经常摆“私”字的表现，查“私”字的危害，挖“私”字的根源，把“私”字搞得越来越臭，把“公”字当作一切行动的准则。过去打算撂挑子的生产队干部，工作积极起来了。过去干活拈轻怕重的人，争着挑重担子了。过去私心较重的人，现在一心为公了。五队社员张应林，以前斤斤计较工分多少。学习“老三篇”以后，他检查说：“我过去光想多挣工分，不关心国家大事和集体利益，这是私心作怪。往后，我要听毛主席的话，向张思德、白求恩学习，全心全意为人民服务。”现在，张应林处处维护国家利益和集体利益，被称为“管得宽”。
    在学习班里，南马庄社员反复地控诉和批判了中国赫鲁晓夫的一系列反革命修正主义谬论，诸如什么“剥削有功”、“发展富农经济”、“三自一包”、“物质刺激”、“吃小亏占大便宜”等等，从而大大提高了路线斗争的觉悟。六队队长耿文选，过去只抓生产，不突出政治。他认为：“只要把生产搞上去，就全妥了。”通过批判中国赫鲁晓夫，他才懂得：突出政治还是不突出政治，这是两条路线的斗争。不突出政治，不但生产搞不好，还会走到资本主义邪路上去。从此，他对于学习毛主席著作积极起来了，队里的生产也有了很大起色。五队饲养员傅景太，一个人喂二十头（匹）牲口，每天挣二十分工。此外，他为生产队培育了三头（匹）幼畜，生产队奖给他一百多元现金。以前，他不认为这是什么问题。通过批判中国赫鲁晓夫，他怎么也坐不住了，找到队长说：“给我记那么多工分，还给我发奖金，这全是受了中国赫鲁晓夫的‘物质刺激’谬论的影响，不符合毛主席的革命路线，咱得改变改变。工分，不能按牲口头数算，奖金，我全部退给集体。”从那以后，傅景太喂牲口更加用心了。
    南马庄大队去冬今春的生产出现了新的跃进局面。在连续五个月来的挖渠整地战斗中，不论刮风下雪，出勤率一直在百分之九十几以上。劳动纪律很好，每次出工，社员们都是排成队伍，举着红旗，高唱革命歌曲，雄赳赳地走向田野。劳动中，很少有人迟到早退，偷懒耍猾。一个月的工程，他们用半个月就完成了；十天的工程，他们用五天就完成了。
    南马庄社员越来越体会到办学习班的好处，他们说：“过去没进学习班，不学习毛主席著作，成天糊里糊涂；进了学习班，一学习毛主席著作，眼也明了，心也亮了，只想跟着毛主席他老人家干革命。学习班就是好，我们要永远办下去。”（附图片）
