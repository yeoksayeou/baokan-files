The revolutionary workers of the Benxi Iron and Steel Company Power Plant resolutely implement Chairman Mao's great directive to "carry out thorough frugality and make revolution." With the strong assistance of the People's Liberation Army Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team stationed at the plant, they have launched a mass campaign to save coal. Last year, while completing the annual electricity generation task 18 days ahead of schedule, they saved the nation more than 80,000 tons of high-quality coal. This year, they have saved the nation another 12,000 tons of coal. (According to Xinhua News Agency)
