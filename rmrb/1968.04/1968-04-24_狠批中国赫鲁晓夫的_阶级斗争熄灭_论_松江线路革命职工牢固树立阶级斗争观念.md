New China News Agency, Shanghai, April 23 – Shanghai Railway Bureau Songjiang Line Revolutionary Committee focuses on the struggle between the two classes, two lines, and two roads, launches a comprehensive and sustained attack on the class enemy, significantly enhances the masses' awareness of class struggle and line struggle, further strengthens the proletarian authority of the revolutionary committee, and the entire front presents a vibrant and prosperous scene of revolution and production.

Shanghai Railway Bureau Songjiang Line is an advanced collective in Shanghai that actively learns and applies Mao Zedong Thought. It is known as "our red iron line" by the proletarian revolutionary faction in Shanghai. Since the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the revolutionary workers on this line have used the invincible Mao Zedong Thought as their weapon to engage in a tenacious struggle against the handful of capitalist roaders within the Shanghai Municipal Committee and the railway bureau. In April last year, they established a revolutionary committee on the basis of seizing power. The revolutionary workers closely united around the newly born revolutionary committee, continued to hold high the great banner of the proletarian revolutionary line of Chairman Mao, focused on class struggle and line struggle, and launched unceasing attacks on the handful of capitalist roaders within the party, including China's Khrushchev, and various class enemies. Thus, they struck down the enemy, tempered themselves, and continuously consolidated and developed the revolutionary committee. In the past two years, in the sharp and complex class struggle, regardless of the various adverse winds and waves stirred up by the enemy, this "red line" remained steadfast, and the trains ran smoothly without any obstacles.

A prominent feature of the Songjiang Line Revolutionary Committee's focus on the struggle between the two classes, two lines, and two roads is that it closely ties the revolutionary criticism to the actual class struggle on the line. They clearly understand that only by closely tying the revolutionary criticism to the actual class struggle on the railway can they thoroughly eliminate the poison of China's Khrushchev's counter-revolutionary revisionist line, finally sever China's Khrushchev's claws on the railway, and accurately, forcefully, and steadily strike down the class enemy. They mobilized the broad revolutionary workers to carry out one campaign after another in the revolutionary criticism, thoroughly and deeply criticizing China's Khrushchev's black "Self-Cultivation," revisionist party-building line, "material incentives," "business first," "class struggle extinction" theory, and other counter-revolutionary revisionist goods. Through the revolutionary criticism, the broad workers generally enhanced their awareness of class struggle and line struggle. They said, "China's Khrushchev wants to lead us into the capitalist quagmire, which is absolutely impossible. The socialist railway must serve socialism!"

Fiercely criticizing China's Khrushchev's "class struggle extinction" theory is an important content of the Songjiang Line Revolutionary Committee's tying the revolutionary criticism to the class struggle on the line. They have held more than forty sessions of various types of Mao Zedong Thought study classes, with over five hundred revolutionary workers on the line, each participating in one to four sessions on average. The broad revolutionary workers used Chairman Mao's teachings on class, class contradictions, and class struggle as their weapons in the study classes to fiercely criticize China's Khrushchev's "class struggle extinction" theory. On the basis of significantly enhancing their awareness of class struggle and line struggle, they saw through the reactionary faces of the handful of class enemies on the railway. This group of people directed their spears at the newly born revolutionary committee, incited the revolutionary masses against the revolutionary committee, and attempted to split the revolutionary committee. These shocking class struggle facts made them realize that China's Khrushchev's "class struggle extinction" theory protected these class enemies. The revolutionary workers further mobilized and launched a fierce attack on the class enemies, rooting out the class enemies hiding on the line one by one.

In focusing on the struggle between the two classes, two lines, and two roads, the Songjiang Line Revolutionary Committee resolutely eliminated various interferences from reactionary trends and firmly grasped the direction of struggle. Not long ago, a rightist reversal wind arose on the line. A counter-revolutionary who had served as a puppet district chief before liberation openly proposed to be "rehabilitated." He stirred up evil winds and lit ghost fires, attempting to overthrow the newly born revolutionary committee and escape the dictatorship of the proletariat over him. The revolutionary committee seized this opportunity to educate the masses on class struggle. Many masses, in the process of striking down this evil wind, enhanced their awareness of class struggle and line struggle, overcame rightist conservative thoughts, and deeply realized that they must not think that with power in hand, everything is peaceful from now on. They must always remember Chairman Mao's teaching of "never forget class struggle" and repel the counterattacks of the class enemies to defend and consolidate the dictatorship of the proletariat.

While leading the masses in class struggle, the Songjiang Line Revolutionary Committee paid great attention to the thought revolutionization of the revolutionary committee members. They mobilized the revolutionary committee members to use the invincible Mao Zedong Thought as their weapon to carry out the struggle against selfishness and public interest in their minds. They realized that the more fiercely they struggle against selfishness, the clearer their minds would be, the more definite their direction would be, and the more firmly they would establish the awareness of class struggle and line struggle. The members of the revolutionary committee followed the great leader Chairman Mao's teaching of "we communists should experience storms and see the world; this storm is the great storm of the masses' struggle, and this world is the great world of the masses' struggle," rooted themselves among the masses, and were tempered and tested in the great storm of the masses' struggle. The Songjiang Line Revolutionary Committee has nine members. Usually, except for leaving two people at home to handle daily work, the rest carried their bedding to the grassroots level, went to the work teams to be the students of the masses, studied and worked with the masses, took the lead in criticizing selfishness and revisionism, and carried out heart-to-heart talks. Because the revolutionary committee members often went deep into the actual situation, they closely connected with the masses and laid a solid foundation among the masses.

The basic experience of the Songjiang Line Revolutionary Committee in focusing on the struggle between the two classes, two lines, and two roads is summed up in one point: unlimited loyalty to Chairman Mao, unlimited loyalty to Mao Zedong Thought, and unlimited loyalty to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. They said: Mao Zedong Thought is the thought of class struggle. To see whether a revolutionary committee is loyal to Chairman Mao, loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, and loyal to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, one should see whether it focuses on the struggle between the two classes, two lines, and two roads. Over the past year, they, with unlimited loyalty to Chairman Mao, Mao Zedong Thought, and Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, insisted on highlighting proletarian politics, highlighting Mao Zedong Thought, using Mao Zedong Thought to command everything, guide everything, reform everything, and promote everything. Now, the broad revolutionary masses of the Songjiang Line are advancing in the struggle between the two classes, two lines, and two roads under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought.

    狠批中国赫鲁晓夫的“阶级斗争熄灭”论
    松江线路革命职工牢固树立阶级斗争观念
    上海铁路分局松江线路革委会牢牢掌握斗争大方向，狠抓两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线斗争，紧密结合本单位阶级斗争实际，深入持久地开展革命大批判，在尖锐复杂的阶级斗争中，任凭敌人兴起种种逆风恶浪，列车一直畅通无阻，革命、生产出现朝气蓬勃的大好景象
    新华社上海二十三日电　上海铁路分局松江线路革命委员会狠抓两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的斗争，向阶级敌人发动全面持久的进攻，大大提高了群众的阶级斗争和路线斗争觉悟，进一步增强了革命委员会的无产阶级权威，整个战线出现了革命和生产朝气蓬勃的大好景象。
    上海铁路分局松江线路，是上海地区活学活用毛泽东思想的一个先进集体，被上海的无产阶级革命派称为“我们的红色钢铁线路”。无产阶级文化大革命以来，这条线路的革命职工以战无不胜的毛泽东思想为武器，同上海市委以及铁路局内一小撮走资派进行了英勇顽强的斗争。去年四月间，他们在夺权胜利的基础上，成立了革命委员会。革命职工紧密团结在新诞生的革委会周围，继续高举毛主席无产阶级革命路线的大旗，狠抓阶级斗争和路线斗争，向中国赫鲁晓夫等党内最大的一小撮走资派和形形色色的阶级敌人，不停顿地发起进攻，从而打击了敌人，锤炼了自己，使革命委员会不断得到巩固和发展。近两年来，在尖锐复杂的阶级搏斗中，任凭敌人兴起种种逆风恶浪，这条“红色线路”始终岿然不动，列车一直畅通无阻。
    松江线路革命委员会狠抓两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线斗争的一个显著特点是：紧密联系线路上阶级斗争的实际，深入持久地开展革命的大批判，他们清楚地认识到：只有把革命大批判同铁路上阶级斗争的实际紧密结合起来，才能彻底肃清中国赫鲁晓夫反革命修正主义路线的流毒，最后斩断中国赫鲁晓夫伸向铁路的魔爪，才能又准又狠又稳地打击阶级敌人。他们发动广大革命职工，在革命大批判中，一个战役接连一个战役地进行，全面深入地批判了中国赫鲁晓夫的黑《修养》、修正主义建党路线、“物质刺激”、
  “业务挂帅”、“阶级斗争熄灭”论等反革命修正主义货色。通过革命的大批判，广大职工普遍提高了阶级斗争和路线斗争觉悟，他们说：“中国赫鲁晓夫要把我们引向资本主义的泥坑，这绝对办不到，社会主义的铁路就是要为社会主义服务！”
    大力批判中国赫鲁晓夫的“阶级斗争熄灭”论，是松江线路革委会把革命大批判同线路上的阶级斗争紧密结合起来的一个重要内容。他们先后举办了四十多期各种类型的毛泽东思想学习班，全线路五百多个革命职工，平均每人参加了一至四次。广大革命职工在学习班上以毛主席关于阶级、阶级矛盾和阶级斗争的教导为武器，狠批了中国赫鲁晓夫的“阶级斗争熄灭”论。在大大提高了阶级斗争和路线斗争觉悟的基础上，他们看清了铁路上一小撮阶级敌人的反动嘴脸。这伙人把矛头直接指向新生的革委会，挑拨革命群众同革委会的关系，妄图分裂革委会。这些触目惊心的阶级斗争事实使他们认识到：中国赫鲁晓夫的“阶级斗争熄灭”论，掩护了这些阶级敌人。革命职工们进一步发动起来，主动地向阶级敌人发起猛烈进攻，把隐藏在线路上的阶级敌人一个一个挖了出来。
    松江线路革委会在狠抓两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线斗争中，坚决排除各种反动思潮的干扰，紧紧掌握住斗争的大方向。不久前，线路上出现了一股右倾翻案妖风，一个解放前当过伪区长的反革命分子，就公然提出要“平反”，他煽阴风，点鬼火，企图颠覆新生的革委会，逃脱无产阶级对他的专政。革委会抓住这件事，对群众进行阶级斗争教育。许多群众在痛击这股妖风中，提高了阶级斗争和路线斗争的觉悟，克服了右倾保守思想。大家深刻地认识到，决不能认为大权在手，从此天下太平了，一定要牢记毛主席“千万不要忘记阶级斗争”的教导，打退阶级敌人的反扑，捍卫和巩固无产阶级专政。
    松江线路革委会在带领群众进行阶级斗争的同时，十分注意搞好革委会成员的思想革命化，发动革委会成员以战无不胜的毛泽东思想为武器，在自己头脑里开展破私立公的斗争。他们认识到，对“私”字斗得越狠，头脑就越清醒，方向就越明确，阶级斗争和路线斗争的观念就树立得越牢固。革委会的成员，遵循伟大领袖毛主席“我们共产党员应该经风雨，见世面；这个风雨，就是群众斗争的大风雨，这个世面，就是群众斗争的大世面”的教导，扎根于群众之中，在群众斗争的大风雨中经受考验和锻炼。松江线路革委会有九个委员，平时除留两个人在家处理日常工作外，其余的人都背着铺盖下到基层，到班组里去当群众的小学生，和群众一起学习，一起劳动，带头斗私批修，开展谈心活动。由于革委会的同志经常深入实际，密切了和群众的联系，在群众中扎下了深厚的基础。
    松江线路革委会狠抓两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线斗争的基本经验，归结到一点，就是无限忠于毛主席，无限忠于毛泽东思想，无限忠于毛主席的无产阶级革命路线。他们说：毛泽东思想就是阶级斗争的思想。看一个革委会忠不忠于毛主席，忠不忠于毛泽东思想，忠不忠于毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，就看它是不是狠抓两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的斗争。一年多来，他们怀着对毛主席、对毛泽东思想、对毛主席无产阶级革命路线的无限忠诚，坚持突出无产阶级政治，突出毛泽东思想，用毛泽东思想统帅一切，指导一切，改造一切，推动一切。现在，松江线路的广大革命群众正在毛泽东思想的指引下，在两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的斗争中不断前进。
