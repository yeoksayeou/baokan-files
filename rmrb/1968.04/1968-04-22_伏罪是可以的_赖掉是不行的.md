In the thunderous and magnificent Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the revolutionary people, under the guidance of the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, exposed China's Khrushchev and smashed the black monument of *Sparking the Prairie* erected for him. The blowhards who advocated for China's Khrushchev's restoration of capitalism are like color-changing insects, changing their protective colors in various ways, attempting to escape.

They argue: "Le Huanzhu wrote the image of the Party's leadership, which is a generalization of Chairman Mao and XX (China's Khrushchev)."

What a "generalization of Chairman Mao and XX (China's Khrushchev)!" Now that you are nervous, you are fabricating lies without any regard. However, no matter how well you fabricate lies, you cannot cover up your past boastful confessions. You, the big and small blowhards, once howled madly:

"When writing about leaders, only one can be written."
"You don't have to portray Mao Zedong's deeds exactly."
"Do not quibble over whether Mao Zedong's specific instructions and his visit to Anyuan are written."
"The script includes Mao Zedong's name, it must be changed!"

In this clamor of "must be changed" and "only one can be written," the big and small leaders of the literary and artistic black line wielded their axes, chopping away the original script's light description of Mao Zedong's brilliant deeds in leading the revolutionary struggle in Anyuan. Your gnashing teeth and shouting are still fresh in our ears, and now you want to evade responsibility? That is a foolish dream!

One trick fails, another is tried. The filmmakers hypocritically declare: "*Sparking the Prairie* is about the life of miners' struggles. The film's main protagonist is the coal miner Yi Mengzi, not Le Huanzhu."

This is a weak trick, not worth refuting. We only need to excerpt a few segments from the articles and reports written by the filmmakers and their promoters to see how these fools have slapped themselves in the face:

"*Sparking the Prairie* successfully portrays the image of Le Huanzhu," "It is a model for portraying the Party's image."
"The appearance of the Party's leader Le Huanzhu illuminates the entire mining area like a million rays of sunlight."
"The film portrays Le Huanzhu from various angles, with few words but a vivid image, leaving a deep impression."

Enough, enough! Le Huanzhu, Le Huanzhu, in your hearts, there is only the incarnation of China's Khrushchev—Le Huanzhu! To highlight Le Huanzhu, you have erased Mao Zedong's glorious achievements in leading the Anyuan workers' movement. To "portray Le Huanzhu from various angles," you shamelessly compared China's Khrushchev to "sunlight," "locomotive," and "incarnation of the Party"; to beautify China's Khrushchev's incarnation Le Huanzhu, you disgracefully portrayed the working masses as the "mob" revolving around Le Huanzhu, and even that so-called "main protagonist" Yi Mengzi is just a clown to set off Le Huanzhu. Initially, you were so enthusiastic and diligent in erecting monuments for China's Khrushchev! Now, your master has become a relic of history, and you clowns start to evade responsibility, clearly acting as armed thugs but pretending to be benevolent Bodhisattvas. How cowardly!

The disguise is stripped away, the defense words are ineffective, and the blowhards of China's Khrushchev play their last trump card: "Our intention was to create the image of the Party's leadership, but the result was to praise China's Khrushchev."

Your "intention was to create the image of the Party's leadership," brilliant! You indeed aimed to "create the image of the Party's leadership," but you created not the image of the leadership of the Communist Party of China, but the image of your group of foxes and dogs. Isn't there such a scene in the *Sparking the Prairie* film script: The workers crowd around Le Huanzhu, insisting on carrying him in a sedan chair to the negotiations. Yi Mengzi whispers beside him: "This is not carrying you, but carrying our Party!" In your eyes, China's Khrushchev is the "Party," and the "Party" is China's Khrushchev. The so-called creation of the "Party's leadership image" by the blowhards of China's Khrushchev is synonymous with the creation of the image of China's Khrushchev.

Too clever by half, you have ruined yourselves. The blowhards of China's Khrushchev have exhausted their "cleverness" and strength, creating public opinion for China's Khrushchev's restoration of capitalism. Now, their hard work has become the charges for the revolutionary people to denounce, and they want to slip away! However, under the bright eyes of the revolutionary people, the various tricks they play can only cause them to lift the stone and drop it on their own feet.

Confessing is acceptable, evading is not!

    伏罪是可以的　赖掉是不行的
    东方红电影制片厂东方红通讯组
    在轰轰烈烈的无产阶级文化大革命中，革命人民在毛泽东思想伟大红旗的指引下，揪出了中国赫鲁晓夫，砸碎了为他树碑立传的《燎原》黑碑。中国赫鲁晓夫复辟资本主义的吹鼓手们，象变色的小爬虫变着各种保护色，企图遁逃。
    他们辩解说：“雷焕觉写的是党的领导形象，是概括了毛主席和×××
  （中国赫鲁晓夫）两个人的。”
    好一个“概括了毛主席和×××（中国赫鲁晓夫）两个人！”现在你们心虚了，竟不顾一切地编造起谎言来了。但是，谎言编得再圆，也掩盖不了你们过去洋洋得意的自白。你们这些大小吹鼓手们曾经疯狂地嚎叫：
      “写领袖人物只能写一个。”
      “不一定把毛主席的事迹原本搬上。”“不要斤斤计较写未写毛主席具体指示和毛主席到安源的史实。”
      “本子里写了毛主席的名字，要改！”
    在这一片“要改”、
  “只能写一个”的喧闹声中，文艺黑线的大小头目们抡起板斧，把原剧本轻描淡写提到毛主席在安源领导革命斗争的光辉事迹都砍削一光。你们咬牙切齿的叫嚣，言犹在耳，就想赖账吗？这是痴心妄想！
    一招失灵，又换一招。影片炮制者们假惺惺地宣称：“《燎原》是写矿工斗争生活的，影片的第一主人公是煤矿工人易猛子，不是雷焕觉。”
    这是虚弱的一招，不值一驳。我们只要把影片炮制者及吹捧者们以前写的文章，作的报告摘录几段，就可以看到这些蠢人是怎样自己打了自己的嘴巴：
    “《燎原》成功地刻划了雷焕觉的形象”，“是塑造了党的形象的典范”。
      “党的领导者雷焕觉的出现象万道霞光映红了整个矿区”。
      “影片从各个不同的角度刻划了雷焕觉的形象，语言不多，形象亲切，给人留下较深的印象。”
    够了，够了！雷焕觉，雷焕觉，你们心里只有一个中国赫鲁晓夫的化身——雷焕觉！你们为了突出雷焕觉，竟把毛主席领导安源工人运动的丰功伟绩抹得一干二净。你们为了“从各个不同的角度刻划雷焕觉的形象”，竟不知羞耻地把中国赫鲁晓夫比作“阳光”、“火车头”、“党的化身”；你们为了美化中国赫鲁晓夫的化身雷焕觉，竟把工人群众丑化为围着雷焕觉转的“群氓”，就是那个你们所谓的“第一主人公”易猛子也不过是衬托雷焕觉的小丑而已。想当初，你们为中国赫鲁晓夫树碑立传何等热心，何等卖力！到如今，你们的主子成了历史的过客，你们这些小丑也耍起赖来，明明是明火执仗的打手，偏要装成慈悲心肠的菩萨。又何等卑怯！
    伪装剥去了，辩护词失效了，中国赫鲁晓夫的吹鼓手又打出了最后一张王牌：“我们的愿望是创造党的领导形象，结果歌颂了中国赫鲁晓夫。”
    你们的“愿望是创造党的领导形象”，妙极了！你们的确是为了“创造党的领导形象”，但是，你们创造的不是中国共产党的领导形象，而是创造你们这群狐群狗党的形象。《燎原》电影剧本中不是有这样的情节吗：工人们簇拥着雷焕觉，一定要用轿子把他抬去谈判。易猛子还在他身边低声说：“这不是抬你，是抬我们的党呵！”在你们眼里，中国赫鲁晓夫就是“党”，“党”就是中国赫鲁晓夫。中国赫鲁晓夫的吹鼓手们所谓的塑造“党的领导形象”，就是塑造中国赫鲁晓夫形象的同义语。
    机关算尽太聪明，反误了卿卿性命。中国赫鲁晓夫的吹鼓手们使尽了“聪明”，拚尽了力气，为中国赫鲁晓夫复辟资本主义大造舆论。现在，他们辛苦的“劳作”成了革命人民声讨的罪状，他们要溜了！但是，在革命人民雪亮的眼睛下，他们玩弄的种种伎俩，只能搬起石头砸了他们自己的脚。
    伏罪是可以的，赖掉是不行的！
